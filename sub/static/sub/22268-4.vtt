WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:02.703
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Okay, friends, you'll recall

00:02.736 --> 00:04.305
Jane was dating Adam,
whose life was...

00:04.338 --> 00:05.706
slightly different
from hers.

00:05.739 --> 00:08.509
But it was going great.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.644
He even bonded
with Jane's son, Mateo.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.281
Don't hurt her feelings
and don't die, okay?

00:13.314 --> 00:15.483
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Unfortunately...
I'm panicking.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.650
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Speaking of panicking,

00:16.684 --> 00:17.718
Rafael was so desperate

00:17.751 --> 00:19.653
to get his hotel back
from his sister, Luisa,

00:19.687 --> 00:22.490
that he made a secret deal
with hotel financier

00:22.523 --> 00:23.691
Katherine Cortez.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.094
And Katherine
was super into him,

00:26.127 --> 00:28.429
and he was, well,
trying to convince her

00:28.462 --> 00:29.630
he was on the same page.

00:29.663 --> 00:32.566
So Rafael made a big move.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.136
But little did he know Luisa
had plans of her own...

00:35.169 --> 00:36.437
My name is Carl.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.506
Rose sent me to help you
get the money quicker.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.508
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
...thanks to this creep.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.143
I know, straight out
of a telenovela, right?

00:42.176 --> 00:43.644
Well, imagine this.

00:43.677 --> 00:45.446
Jane's father recently
got back together

00:45.479 --> 00:46.580
with her mother.

00:46.614 --> 00:49.117
Only complication:
his ex, Darci,

00:49.150 --> 00:51.285
just gave birth
to their daughter.

00:51.319 --> 00:54.255
Oh, and she also fell in love
with his archrival, Esteban.

00:54.288 --> 00:55.823
I know, crazy, right?

00:55.856 --> 00:57.491
So let's see what happens next.

00:59.727 --> 01:04.165
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva
was 28 years, two months,

01:04.198 --> 01:05.833
and 12 days old,

01:05.866 --> 01:10.471
she met her baby sister
for the first time.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.773
But it wasn't until
five days later

01:12.806 --> 01:16.110
that they had their
very first photo shoot.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.278
So cute.

01:17.311 --> 01:18.412
Love it so much.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.148
Jane, your sister
found her light.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.349
I need you to find yours.

01:21.382 --> 01:22.883
Great.
(camera snaps)

01:22.916 --> 01:24.385
Okay, not, let me
see you smile.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.720
More. More.

01:26.754 --> 01:27.755
With your eyes.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.823
As I taught Tyra Banks,
you have to smize.

01:32.893 --> 01:35.129
Got it. Perfect.
Great. So that's a wrap?

01:35.163 --> 01:37.331
Yes.
Okay.

01:37.365 --> 01:38.266
On that costume.

01:39.767 --> 01:40.734
Um, well, uh,

01:40.768 --> 01:42.836
how many of these are we doing?

01:42.870 --> 01:45.306
Oh, we'll go as long as
your sister has stamina.

01:46.774 --> 01:47.841
Okay...

01:47.875 --> 01:48.876
time for eggs!

01:48.909 --> 01:50.678
ROGELIO:
Can you curl up

01:50.711 --> 01:52.813
and make yourself
a little smaller, Jane?

01:52.846 --> 01:56.550
You just look so big
next to her.

01:56.584 --> 01:57.885
She's 18 inches long.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.253
Smaller.

02:03.924 --> 02:05.159
If you don't believe
you're a bear,

02:05.193 --> 02:06.594
I won't believe you're a bear.

02:06.627 --> 02:07.861
Come on!

02:07.895 --> 02:09.797
Get in touch with your
mama bear instincts.

02:11.765 --> 02:14.635
Good! All right,
everybody out.

02:14.668 --> 02:17.171
Closed set.
Why?

02:17.205 --> 02:18.772
Oh, it's time for
your naked shot.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.641
Your little bums
side by side...

02:20.674 --> 02:21.809
Okay, photo shoot's over.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.684
*

02:34.255 --> 02:35.723
DARCI:
Oh...

02:35.756 --> 02:37.258
I don't buy Jane as a bear,

02:37.291 --> 02:38.526
but the baby's killing it.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.394
No posting, though.

02:40.428 --> 02:42.196
Oh, of course not.
There's a complete

02:42.230 --> 02:43.731
press and social media blackout
on the baby

02:43.764 --> 02:45.366
until we do our own photo shoot

02:45.399 --> 02:47.801
for the birth announcement.
Fine, but we can't

02:47.835 --> 02:49.937
send out an announcement
until we settle on a name.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.239
And again,

02:51.272 --> 02:52.940
it's a hard pass on Rogeliana.

02:52.973 --> 02:56.244
Then what's your pitch?
Because Darcella is also out.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.478
Agreed.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.746
We both have to love it.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.248
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wow.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.350
Looks like things
are actually pretty good

03:02.383 --> 03:03.584
between the two of them.

03:03.617 --> 03:06.454
Actually, I had an idea.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.356
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I mean, the three of them.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.324
And it is a beautiful name.

03:10.358 --> 03:11.892
I really love it.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.827
Don't let the fact
that it came from me

03:13.861 --> 03:15.829
stop you from
embracing it, Rogelio.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.365
Just get it over with.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.367
BOTH:
One, two...

03:19.400 --> 03:21.235
Amada.
Amada.

03:23.271 --> 03:26.340
Hmm. I actually like that.

03:26.374 --> 03:27.575
Right?

03:27.608 --> 03:29.310
So do we have a winner?
Hold up.

03:29.343 --> 03:30.444
I mean,
would I buy a Lamborghini

03:30.478 --> 03:31.379
without driving it first?

03:31.412 --> 03:32.913
You can't afford a Lamborghini.
The point is

03:32.946 --> 03:35.449
I have to take it out
for a spin first

03:35.483 --> 03:37.318
and see how it feels.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.586
I felt ridiculous,

03:38.619 --> 03:41.322
but the pictures
are actually cute.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.523
(chuckles)
I was thinking

03:42.556 --> 03:44.925
I could text one to Adam.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.460
Like, with no context.

03:46.494 --> 03:48.662
Like, me, "Hey,"

03:48.696 --> 03:50.464
coming out of an egg.

03:50.498 --> 03:51.665
You really don't think I should?

03:51.699 --> 03:52.866
I think you told me

03:52.900 --> 03:54.868
not to let you reach out
for a week.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.604
Yeah, but isn't
four days enough?

03:56.637 --> 03:58.339
You said to say no.

03:58.372 --> 04:01.375
And I do think
a week of space is good.

04:01.409 --> 04:02.543
You guys moved so fast.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.877
You have to take a beat

04:03.911 --> 04:05.713
and think about
where you're heading.

04:05.746 --> 04:06.814
I know.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.417
I mean, I get
why he panicked.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.884
Thinking of having a kid around

04:10.918 --> 04:13.787
is different than
actually having a kid around.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.323
(chuckles)
(microwave beeps)

04:15.356 --> 04:16.824
I just like him so much, Ma.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.665
Great. He's just on a deadline.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.767
Can you tell Mateo that his
ice cream's ready, please?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.802
Mm-hmm.
Gracias.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.571
She just started liking him.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.440
If everything works for us,

04:32.473 --> 04:33.774
I don't want to go backwards.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.943
I want two scoops.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.911
(chuckles)
You know the rules. Only one.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.047
Daddy's friend lets me have two.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.816
Which friend?

04:42.850 --> 04:44.985
I think Kathord?

04:45.018 --> 04:46.487
"Kathord"?

04:46.520 --> 04:47.755
Katherine?

04:49.690 --> 04:51.992
When did Mateo meet Katherine?

04:52.025 --> 04:53.427
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aka Kathord.

04:53.461 --> 04:54.762
Last week.
I thought

04:54.795 --> 04:55.896
you were gonna end things
with her.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.332
I never said that. You assumed.

04:58.366 --> 05:01.702
Well, I certainly didn't assume
that she'd be meeting Mateo.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.972
Well, he had
just met Adam, so...
That was an accident.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.974
And you insisted
on sitting down with him

05:07.007 --> 05:08.842
to make sure that
he was a good influence.

05:08.876 --> 05:11.111
Oh, you want to sit down
with Katherine? Look,

05:11.144 --> 05:12.813
it was a casual thing.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.682
And I get that you're upset
that it happened...

05:14.715 --> 05:16.684
It didn't just happen.
You decided to do it.

05:16.717 --> 05:19.820
And then you decided
not to tell me.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.121
Because I knew
you'd react like this.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.122
And honestly, I thought
it'd be easier

05:22.155 --> 05:24.725
to beg for forgiveness
than ask for permission.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.527
Is that what you're doing
right now?

05:26.560 --> 05:28.529
Begging forgiveness?

05:28.562 --> 05:31.732
Yes, Jane, I am.
I am sorry I didn't

05:31.765 --> 05:33.567
talk to you first.
Oh, stand up.

05:33.601 --> 05:35.102
You don't have to get down
on one knee.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.938
I was doing a lunge.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.607
Oh.
Look,

05:39.640 --> 05:40.874
it was a quick meeting, okay?

05:40.908 --> 05:42.443
It's not like
she's suddenly gonna be

05:42.476 --> 05:43.377
a big part of his life.

05:43.411 --> 05:45.579
Well, if that changes,
will you tell me?

05:45.613 --> 05:46.980
Yes.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.583
XIOMARA:
So, please let me know,

05:49.617 --> 05:51.985
because we'd love to have Kayla
in dance class this semester,

05:52.019 --> 05:54.688
but the session's
almost full. Thanks.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.457
Well, that's great news.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.758
Session's almost full.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.593
I thought you said
enrollment was down.

05:59.627 --> 06:01.595
It is. I just said that
to pressure them.

06:01.629 --> 06:04.632
I keep losing students
to Stage Sensations.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.534
* Stage Sensations

06:06.567 --> 06:07.668
* The next generation

06:07.701 --> 06:10.170
* Of singing and dancing

06:10.203 --> 06:12.440
* And acting sensations.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.742
ANNOUNCER:
Coming soon to a mall near you.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.844
I'm sorry you're stressed.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.447
And so is Amada.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.081
Who's Amada?

06:21.114 --> 06:22.215
It's a name we're trying out.

06:22.249 --> 06:24.618
Would you like to hold her
before Darci picks her up?

06:24.652 --> 06:27.721
I heard that holding a newborn
for a few minutes

06:27.755 --> 06:29.657
actually makes you more relaxed.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.459
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah, I'm guessing

06:31.492 --> 06:33.594
he didn't hear that
from a stay-at-home parent.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.195
Next time.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.130
I've got, like,
a million calls to make.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.900
SONIA:
What are you staring at?

06:41.902 --> 06:44.204
Oh, yeah. My customer's hot.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.907
I think your customer's
Jeffrey Mullins.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.009
Let me see his receipt.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.145
(gasps) Oh, my God.

06:52.179 --> 06:53.881
It is Jeffrey Mullins.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.685
He is a huge
New York literary agent.

06:57.718 --> 07:00.020
Ooh, so cute and rich.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.922
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Book agent, not movie agent.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.190
Made that mistake once.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.758
You don't understand.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.894
This is kismet.
I've been talking with my editor

07:06.927 --> 07:08.929
about meeting with an agent
before my book comes out,

07:08.962 --> 07:12.900
and here's one of the biggest
in the country, and...

07:13.901 --> 07:15.936
Why is Petra air kissing

07:15.969 --> 07:17.538
Jeffrey Mullins right now?
Hmm.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.039
Oh!

07:22.576 --> 07:24.011
Petra, hey. (chuckles)

07:24.044 --> 07:26.046
You know Jeffrey Mullins?

07:26.079 --> 07:27.781
He has a house in Palm Beach.

07:27.815 --> 07:30.083
We've been to about a million
fund-raisers together.

07:30.117 --> 07:33.787
He's really into saving dolphins
or sea monkeys or something.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.656
Honestly, it's hard to focus
on what he's saying.

07:35.689 --> 07:36.790
He's so handsome.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.091
I would love to meet him.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.993
Like, really love.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.930
Because he's a book agent.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.665
Oh. Oh, that's right.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.166
You're a writer.
Yeah, right.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.936
I'm a writer.
So, can you introduce me to him?

07:48.969 --> 07:50.838
I'll do anything.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.973
Sure. I'll set up a meeting.
Oh.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.575
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Hmm, that was easy.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.577
What?
I just expected

07:56.610 --> 07:57.778
a little more pushback.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.212
Yeah.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.849
Usually I'd try
to get something.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.984
Well, I guess since
we're both over Rafael,

08:04.017 --> 08:05.619
there's not much
to fight about, right?

08:05.653 --> 08:07.254
No more drama.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.722
I like that.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.023
No more drama.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.191
(laughs)
Yeah.

08:11.224 --> 08:12.660
(both scream)

08:12.693 --> 08:14.061
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Is it just me,

08:14.094 --> 08:15.495
or does that seem
like a bad omen?

08:17.798 --> 08:18.732
What is that?

08:18.766 --> 08:20.601
Are those...?

08:20.634 --> 08:23.270
Oh, my God. Termites.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.806
(people screaming)
Ugh!

08:25.839 --> 08:27.675
JANE: I feel like
they're all over me.

08:32.079 --> 08:34.147
(sighs)

08:34.181 --> 08:37.517
(video game beeping)
What?

08:43.323 --> 08:45.292
Mateo.
(beeping stops)

08:45.325 --> 08:47.561
Where did you get this?
I can't remember.

08:47.595 --> 08:50.163
What do you mean,
you can't remember?
What's going on?

08:50.197 --> 08:52.766
Daddy, don't worry. I didn't
tell her who it was from.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.169
(video game beeping)

08:56.203 --> 08:58.706
I'm sorry, Mateo.
You're too young for this.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.641
(beeping stops)
Mommy, that's mine!

09:00.674 --> 09:02.610
It was a gift from Kathord.
Well,

09:02.643 --> 09:03.977
you shouldn't
have been given it.
Give it back!

09:04.011 --> 09:05.646
I want it back this very minute!

09:05.679 --> 09:07.347
I'm going to give you some time
to calm down, Mateo.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.883
Now! Now!

09:09.917 --> 09:12.820
Do yo need some
time to calm down?

09:14.822 --> 09:17.290
She gave him an iPad,

09:17.324 --> 09:19.627
and you told him
to lie about it?

09:19.660 --> 09:20.794
I didn't tell him to lie.

09:20.828 --> 09:21.929
I just told him
not to mention it.

09:21.962 --> 09:22.963
Kind of like a joke.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.165
Wait, you're justifying this?

09:25.198 --> 09:26.366
I didn't know
she was gonna give it to him.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.636
But a lot of kids have them,
so it's not that big of a deal.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.604
Except we have a no screen rule.
No.

09:30.638 --> 09:31.504
You have a no screen rule

09:31.538 --> 09:33.140
that I went along with,
but you know what?

09:33.173 --> 09:35.676
I've changed my mind.
I am fine with them.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.244
Too bad. My house, my rules.

09:37.277 --> 09:38.612
Then maybe I shouldn't
live here anymore.

09:38.646 --> 09:40.714
Great. You can leave right now.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.049
Perfect.
I'll go stay with Katherine.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.751
Terrific.
Maybe if you're a good boy,

09:43.784 --> 09:45.218
she'll buy you an iPad.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.319
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Whoa! Looks like Jane

09:46.353 --> 09:47.354
really got in touch

09:47.387 --> 09:48.622
with her mama bear instincts.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.830
NARRATOR: As you all well know,
in the animal kingdom,

09:56.864 --> 09:58.098
it's kill or be...

09:58.131 --> 09:59.266
LUISA:
Quiet. I'm thinking.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.334
About what? You did great.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.003
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
You remember

10:03.036 --> 10:05.272
this creepy dude, right?
(inhaler puffs)

10:05.305 --> 10:07.207
Sent by Rose to help Luisa.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.143
Phase one complete.
You released the termites.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.812
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hmm,
I thought his plan would be

10:11.845 --> 10:13.313
a little more sinister,
honestly.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.082
Now, all you have to
do next is...
(knocks)

10:15.115 --> 10:16.850
Hey!

10:16.884 --> 10:17.851
No one can see me.

10:17.885 --> 10:20.187
(scoffs)

10:20.220 --> 10:23.356
Petra, what can I do for you?

10:23.390 --> 10:25.659
Can I come in?
No, you can't. Um...

10:25.693 --> 10:27.761
I'm in the middle
of giving myself a...

10:27.795 --> 10:29.396
a breast self-exam.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.932
Once a month.
So important.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.667
I'm gonna stay on you
about that.

10:35.736 --> 10:38.238
Well, I just wanted to update
you on the termite plan.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.207
The guests are being
relocated to the Fairwick.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.042
Hopefully, we can keep
the kids club open.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.211
And as far as getting rid
of the termites goes...

10:44.244 --> 10:45.412
I called
the exterminators.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.347
We need to fumigate immediately.

10:47.380 --> 10:48.381
They're
coming tomorrow.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.317
Wow. Yeah. G-Great.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.119
Thank you
for taking care of that.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.922
I'll let you get
back to your...

10:55.923 --> 10:57.691
...exam.

11:00.894 --> 11:04.197
Hey. I was wondering
if we can talk for a minute?

11:04.231 --> 11:05.232
Of course.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.967
Should we take a walk?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.702
Get some air,
avoid some termites.

11:08.736 --> 11:09.970
Sounds perfect.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.139
These two have
really turned a corner.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.842
So, I am worried
about Rafael.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.410
And mad, too,
but mostly worried.

11:17.444 --> 11:18.846
Why? What's going on?

11:18.879 --> 11:20.080
He's just not acting
like himself.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.949
And, well...
(sighs)

11:21.982 --> 11:24.417
I think he's going into one of
those self-destructive periods.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.987
I mean, this Katherine woman
is the worst.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.722
He can't go into business
with her long-term.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.390
But whenever we talk,

11:30.423 --> 11:33.493
we end up fighting, and I was
thinking that maybe together,

11:33.526 --> 11:34.895
we can get through to him.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.296
No. Absolutely not.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.397
What?
In fact, not
only would I not

11:37.430 --> 11:38.398
talk to him about Katherine,

11:38.431 --> 11:40.000
but I want you to stay
out of it. Understood?

11:40.033 --> 11:41.735
Excuse me?
This deal

11:41.769 --> 11:43.403
is on the verge
of going through.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.405
This is not about the hotel.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.140
Okay, how's this?

11:47.174 --> 11:49.276
If you want me to set
a lunch with Jeffrey Mullins,

11:49.309 --> 11:51.779
you'll leave Rafael alone.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.782
So, basically, she just wants
you to not say anything

11:54.815 --> 11:56.183
to Rafael for a couple of days

11:56.216 --> 11:58.051
until he signs
this contract with Katherine?

11:58.085 --> 11:59.252
Exactly.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.421
And Rafael wants you
to stay out of it?

12:01.454 --> 12:02.389
Right. Yes.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.291
So... stay out of it.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.293
And go to the Jeffrey
Mullins meeting,

12:06.326 --> 12:07.861
and don't feel bad about it.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.897
Really?
Yes.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.031
Which is obviously
what you want to do,

12:11.064 --> 12:13.133
because you came to me
for advice instead of Abuela.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.335
She might give you more
of the morality crap.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.337
ROGELIO:
Ah, yes.

12:17.370 --> 12:21.141
Alba, the wise
old owl.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.509
I'm sorry, what?

12:22.542 --> 12:24.244
That's what I landed on
for her photo shoot.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.113
Alba has such incredible
wisdom to share,

12:26.146 --> 12:27.447
so she's going
to be an owl.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.117
This is my inspiration...

12:32.385 --> 12:34.221
Wait, what happened
to "Amada"?
Unfortunately,

12:34.254 --> 12:35.789
I had to move on.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.791
Ryan Gosling has a daughter
named Amada,

12:37.825 --> 12:39.326
and I don't want to make

12:39.359 --> 12:42.129
the notorious Gosling-De La Vega
rivalry even worse.

12:42.162 --> 12:45.198
Uh, I'm sure Ryan will
appreciate that.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.433
I know, yeah.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.535
And for you, Xo...
I was thinking,

12:48.568 --> 12:51.504
"unlikely-but-enduring
animal friendships."

12:51.538 --> 12:55.008
They might not be blood related,
but they are deeply bonded.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.979
It is an homage

12:59.012 --> 13:01.514
to your stepdaughter-stepmother
relationship.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.085
Did any animals leap out at you?

13:05.118 --> 13:07.320
Not really. You choose.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.222
Okay. Wish me luck.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.992
I'm putting up flyers
for the dance studio.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.097
(sighs)

13:19.266 --> 13:20.533
Hey there, Crystal.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.071
Oh. Hey, Xiomara.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.106
I heard you opened
a dance studio.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.041
I heard you opened
a vocal studio.

13:28.075 --> 13:31.078
Well, you can have this pole
if you need it.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.246
My enrollment is off the charts.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.182
Then why are you
putting up flyers?

13:35.215 --> 13:37.484
The longer the wait list,
the more exclusive the club.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.319
Word on the street
says your numbers

13:39.352 --> 13:40.921
are down.
Yeah, well...

13:40.954 --> 13:42.255
word on the street says...

13:42.289 --> 13:43.857
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And then, friends,

13:43.891 --> 13:45.325
the strangest thing happened.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.060
That's true.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.862
What?
You must be more
successful, Crystal,

13:48.896 --> 13:51.464
because that place
Stage Sensations is killing me.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.333
* Stage Sensations

13:53.366 --> 13:54.868
* The next genera...

13:54.902 --> 13:56.403
God, I hate that freakin' song.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.873
I'm going into business
with Crystal!

13:59.907 --> 14:01.508
Who's Crystal?
From high school.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.143
Slutty Crystal?

14:03.176 --> 14:05.412
I don't call her that anymore.
Since when?

14:05.445 --> 14:07.147
Since we decided to go
into business together.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.148
But you guys hate each other.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.616
We used to hate each other.

14:09.649 --> 14:13.153
But we actually got to talking
and instead of competing,

14:13.186 --> 14:15.355
we're going to combine forces.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.457
Increase enrollment
while reducing costs.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.159
You know,
kill two birds with one stone.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.061
But what if the two birds
peck each other to death?

14:21.094 --> 14:22.930
Oh, stop. We're over it.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.899
And she actually has
some really great ideas.

14:25.933 --> 14:29.502
Turns out Slutty Crystal is
really Entrepreneurial Crystal.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.637
(phone chimes)
Right. Oh.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.226
Wha...

15:05.272 --> 15:06.306
(sighs)

15:23.323 --> 15:25.325
(sighs)

15:29.096 --> 15:30.563
LUISA:
I don't think I can do this.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.632
You can.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.001
What if someone gets hurt?

15:34.034 --> 15:35.535
The hotel's gonna
be evacuated.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.270
That was the whole point
of the termites.

15:37.304 --> 15:39.272
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, that makes more sense.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.707
All you have to do

15:40.740 --> 15:43.310
is steal a piece of tubing
from the fumigator.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.045
Then you'll coat it
in an accelerant,

15:45.078 --> 15:47.147
you'll wait till
the hotel fills with fumes,

15:47.180 --> 15:49.516
you light the tubing
and you throw it in the hotel.

15:49.549 --> 15:50.717
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, is that all?

15:50.750 --> 15:53.253
Now is not the time
to look back.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.222
You need the insurance
money, right?

15:55.255 --> 15:56.523
That's what you said.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.993
If I ever get caught,

16:00.027 --> 16:01.661
you need to deposit
$100 million

16:01.694 --> 16:03.696
into my account
here in the Caymans.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.366
That'll initiate
my escape protocol.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.369
Okay, let's do it.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.438
Let's burn the hotel down.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.578
Jane!
JANE: Oh.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.547
Hi there, Katherine.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.549
So, I heard you weren't happy
with the gift I gave Mateo.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.784
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Remember,
Jane, don't interfere.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.419
Think about Jeffrey Mullins,

16:26.453 --> 16:29.156
noted book agent
to minor stars.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.291
It's fine.
I-I know you meant well.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.393
I just really like to limit
Mateo's screen time.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.028
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well done.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.529
Okay, look, that's not
why I'm really here.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.798
Are you gonna be a problem
for Rafael and me?

16:38.831 --> 16:41.268
Excuse me?
Because it seems like

16:41.301 --> 16:42.669
you tend to overstep
your bounds.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.304
So I just wanted
to make sure

16:44.337 --> 16:46.139
you're not going
to get in the way,

16:46.173 --> 16:47.240
long-term.

16:49.376 --> 16:50.410
No.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.279
I'm not.

16:52.312 --> 16:55.115
She's the worst, Abuela,
honestly.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.351
Nothing.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.220
He's just using her
to get his hotel back.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.155
Yeah.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.757
And it's not going to end well,
I can feel it.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.795
I tried. But he told me
to stay out of it.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.830
And Petra said
if I don't stay out of it,

17:10.863 --> 17:13.266
she's not introducing me
to this big literary agent.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.573
*

17:27.180 --> 17:29.316
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which, for the record,
is the advice Jane wanted.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.718
Which is why she went
to Abuela this time.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.087
Every time we talk, we fight.

17:34.121 --> 17:36.489
So I was thinking that maybe
I can write him a letter?

17:39.659 --> 17:42.662
NARRATOR: Which is pretty much
exactly what Jane knew she
would say.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.334
That, too.

17:47.367 --> 17:50.437
And so, write Jane did.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.210
And trust me, friends,
the letter was epic

17:57.244 --> 17:59.379
and poignant and...

17:59.412 --> 18:00.747
Mommy, I have a question.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.749
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Damn, Mateo!

18:02.782 --> 18:04.083
Way to interrupt her flow.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.756
MATEO:
Hi, Adam.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.124
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wait, what?

18:11.158 --> 18:12.525
Adam, hi!
It's me, Mateo!

18:12.559 --> 18:14.194
ADAM: Hey, buddy!
You promised me

18:14.227 --> 18:15.528
you'd show me
your comic books.

18:15.562 --> 18:16.796
Can I come over now
and see them?

18:16.829 --> 18:17.797
JANE:
Oh. Nope.

18:17.830 --> 18:20.200
Can you-- come here. (grunts)

18:20.233 --> 18:21.734
(laughs) Oh, my gosh.
Uh, hi, Adam.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.270
I am so sorry.

18:23.303 --> 18:24.804
Uh, Mateo snuck off
with my phone.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.407
I don't even know where
he learned how to FaceTime.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.409
Daddy's friend
Katherine showed me.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.411
NARRATOR: Geez, does this woman
moonlight at the Genius Bar?

18:31.444 --> 18:32.612
So can we go?

18:32.645 --> 18:34.881
Uh, fine by me,

18:34.914 --> 18:36.849
but it's up to your mom.

18:36.883 --> 18:37.884
You don't have to...

18:37.917 --> 18:39.319
Aw, come on.

18:39.352 --> 18:40.487
Swing by for a quick visit.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.754
Yay! We're coming!

18:41.788 --> 18:43.623
Oh! (sighs)

18:43.656 --> 18:46.293
Wow!

18:46.326 --> 18:49.196
This place is awesome.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.198
Ah, just be careful,
no running.
ADAM: Oops.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.233
Sorry, buddy, that
is a first edition.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.901
Look at these
action figures.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.204
Cool, huh?

18:57.237 --> 18:59.639
Thanks for having us over.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.374
I know it's not a week yet.

19:01.408 --> 19:02.642
One more day.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.511
I'm glad you're here.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.779
I've been, uh,

19:06.813 --> 19:08.581
been thinking about you
a lot and missing you.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.250
Yeah? Me, too.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.784
MATEO:
Look at me!

19:11.818 --> 19:12.852
I'm a superhero!

19:12.885 --> 19:14.321
Okay, Mateo, be careful.
Pow! Zam!

19:14.354 --> 19:15.455
Okay. We'd better get going.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.723
I don't want to go!

19:16.756 --> 19:18.791
Well, it's time.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.660
Adam invited me!
He doesn't want me to go!

19:20.693 --> 19:22.962
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I wouldn't
be too sure about that.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.931
You can stay a little longer,
if that would...

19:24.964 --> 19:26.399
See? I'm not going!

19:26.433 --> 19:27.667
Yes, you are.
Right now.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.869
No, no, no, no, no, no!

19:29.902 --> 19:31.471
Hey, you better listen
to your mom, buddy.

19:31.504 --> 19:32.805
Be quiet! I hate you!

19:32.839 --> 19:34.307
I hate you!

19:34.341 --> 19:35.575
Sorry.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.544
I hate you!

19:37.577 --> 19:39.412
KATHERINE: How do you really
feel about me?

19:39.446 --> 19:40.613
What?

19:40.647 --> 19:42.415
What are you
talking about?

19:42.449 --> 19:43.583
Oh, I ran into Jane,

19:43.616 --> 19:44.951
and she gave me
the sense that

19:44.984 --> 19:46.819
you don't see us
as a long-term thing.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.322
She said that?
No.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.723
But I could tell
she was thinking it.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.459
Well, maybe she's just jealous.

19:52.492 --> 19:53.593
Ignore her.

19:53.626 --> 19:54.761
I wish I could.

19:54.794 --> 19:57.697
It's just...

19:57.730 --> 20:00.700
when you have money, it's hard
to tell if people want you

20:00.733 --> 20:02.569
or they want your lifestyle.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.337
I completely understand.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.972
I had a lot of money, remember?

20:06.005 --> 20:07.840
Yeah.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.442
Still...

20:09.476 --> 20:11.444
I know this is a great deal.

20:11.478 --> 20:14.447
But deal aside...

20:14.481 --> 20:16.449
how do you feel about me?

20:16.483 --> 20:18.651
Because if you don't
have real feelings,

20:18.685 --> 20:20.320
you can just tell me

20:20.353 --> 20:21.888
and we'll go our separate ways.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.590
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And in that moment, friends,

20:23.623 --> 20:25.758
Rafael's animal instincts
kicked in.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.460
He just needed to survive.

20:27.494 --> 20:29.729
We are not going
our separate ways.

20:29.762 --> 20:34.334
Look, I didn't want to
say this so soon, but...

20:34.367 --> 20:37.470
I'm falling for you, Kitty.

20:37.504 --> 20:38.738
(exhales)

20:38.771 --> 20:39.972
(sniffs)

20:50.550 --> 20:51.884
Hey, Adam.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.520
I'm-I'm sorry again
about earlier.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.688
ADAM:
No, no, it's fine.

20:55.722 --> 20:57.690
Look, I know we decided

20:57.724 --> 20:59.025
to think about things
for a week,

20:59.058 --> 21:01.294
and it's only day six,

21:01.328 --> 21:04.464
but can we just
bag this whole time apart thing?

21:04.497 --> 21:06.399
What?
Well, um...

21:06.433 --> 21:07.500
unless you're over me.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.402
No. I-I'm...

21:09.436 --> 21:12.605
I'm just surprised,
after what happened with Mateo.

21:12.639 --> 21:13.806
It was cool, actually.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.608
I realized I can
put up with that, easy.

21:15.642 --> 21:18.445
Oh.

21:18.478 --> 21:19.946
Yeah, um...

21:19.979 --> 21:22.449
I... I-I don't want
to be with somebody

21:22.482 --> 21:24.551
that can just "put up"
with my son.

21:24.584 --> 21:25.918
Well, no,
that's not what I meant.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.688
I meant that it's worth it,
for you.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.457
I don't want to feel like
I'm being tested

21:30.490 --> 21:31.891
every time we're with Mateo.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.560
No, it's coming out wrong.
You won't.

21:33.593 --> 21:35.094
I will.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.029
I misspoke.
JANE: I know.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.466
But it's still true.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.401
Look, Adam, I-I think
that we should...

21:41.434 --> 21:43.603
One more day.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.905
What?
ADAM: We said seven days,

21:45.938 --> 21:48.541
so you can't break up
with me today.

21:48.575 --> 21:52.479
Just... think about it
one more day, okay?

21:52.512 --> 21:54.514
Please, Jane.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.818
Yeah. Okay.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.853
We'll talk tomorrow.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.593
ROGELIO:
Who has the best husband

22:06.626 --> 22:07.860
in the world?

22:07.894 --> 22:09.028
You do!

22:09.061 --> 22:10.630
Because the
soundstage has been

22:10.663 --> 22:13.466
officially booked
for your promo video shoot.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.768
Aw, Rogelio!

22:15.802 --> 22:17.870
And I was able to scrounge up
some tasteful,

22:17.904 --> 22:20.373
yet very dazzling
wardrobe options,

22:20.407 --> 22:23.042
so you and Crystal will have
plenty to choose from.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.778
Thank you,
Best Husband in the World.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.547
And since you'll be
on set anyway,

22:27.580 --> 22:29.882
would it be easier for you
if I just schedule

22:29.916 --> 22:32.652
your photo session with the baby
for right after?

22:32.685 --> 22:35.388
Uh, you know, I'd rather not.

22:35.422 --> 22:37.924
It's gonna be
really hectic that day,

22:37.957 --> 22:40.960
and my head's gonna be totally
in the game for the video shoot.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.995
I got to call Crystal.

22:45.064 --> 22:46.533
(sighs)

22:46.566 --> 22:49.702
You may not have
picked up on it,

22:49.736 --> 22:53.172
but your mother
hates Delilah.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.674
Who's Delilah?

22:54.707 --> 22:56.108
The baby.

22:56.142 --> 22:58.545
Are you saying
you don't see her as a Delilah?

22:58.578 --> 23:00.980
No. Uh, it's cute.

23:01.013 --> 23:03.082
And Mom doesn't hate her.

23:03.115 --> 23:04.116
Really?

23:04.150 --> 23:05.618
Because she hardly looks at her,

23:05.652 --> 23:07.186
she doesn't want
to hold her,

23:07.219 --> 23:09.756
and she clearly doesn't want
to do the photo shoot.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.624
Dad, you have to remember
that Mom didn't really want

23:11.658 --> 23:13.960
a baby in her life,
so it's gonna take some time

23:13.993 --> 23:16.863
for her to warm up to...
Delilah.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.765
Yeah.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.633
I don't like it.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.669
Well, you don't have much
of a choice if Mom needs time.

23:22.702 --> 23:23.636
No, not that.

23:23.670 --> 23:25.505
Delilah. I hate it.
Don't ever use it again.

23:25.538 --> 23:28.074
Matelio, what do you think
your aunt's name should be?

23:28.107 --> 23:29.442
How about Pee Pee Pants?

23:29.476 --> 23:31.578
Mateo.
Okay, Poo Poo Pants

23:31.611 --> 23:33.079
or Dirty Diaper.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.781
Mateo, where do
bathroom words belong?

23:34.814 --> 23:36.148
In the bathroom.

23:36.182 --> 23:37.550
Mm-hmm.

23:37.584 --> 23:40.587
Okay, Toilet Plunger
or Diarrhea Poo.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.689
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: The kid's
a potty mouth thesaurus!

23:42.722 --> 23:44.156
ROGELIO:
It's okay, baby.

23:44.190 --> 23:46.526
We'll find a name for you.

23:46.559 --> 23:49.028
So, they start out as babies,
but they breed like crazy.

23:49.061 --> 23:51.631
They lay, like,
30,000 eggs per day.

23:51.664 --> 23:54.834
Uh, so how soon can you
get this taken care of?

23:54.867 --> 23:56.469
Soon as the hotel's evacuated.
Oh, well, everyone will

23:56.503 --> 23:57.604
be out by the end of the day.

23:57.637 --> 24:00.607
And how long before it's safe
to open our doors again?

24:00.640 --> 24:02.609
MAN: Well, ideally,
on a space this large,

24:02.642 --> 24:04.210
you want to allow
yourself a 72-hour

24:04.243 --> 24:08.114
aeration process, but you'd
probably get away with 48.

24:08.147 --> 24:09.982
PETRA: But I-I was
told that we could

24:10.016 --> 24:11.884
leave the kids club open.
Yeah.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.620
That's far enough away.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.655
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us to...

24:18.658 --> 24:20.493
Where's Rafael?
Is he running late?

24:20.527 --> 24:21.861
I don't know.
I'm not his keeper.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.496
It's Saturday brunch.
We never miss brunch.

24:23.530 --> 24:24.597
That's why I'm asking.

24:24.631 --> 24:25.898
I'm sure he'll be here.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.166
You don't have to worry.

24:27.199 --> 24:28.835
Hey.

24:28.868 --> 24:31.103
Hands off, right?

24:31.137 --> 24:33.239
Come on, kids,
let's go eat!

24:33.272 --> 24:35.241
JANE: Well, actually, my
hands have been a little on.

24:35.274 --> 24:37.043
Excuse me?
You'll find out soon enough,

24:37.076 --> 24:38.611
so I might as well tell you.

24:38.645 --> 24:39.912
Tell me what?

24:39.946 --> 24:41.514
I wrote Rafael a letter,

24:41.548 --> 24:42.915
and I gave it to Krishna
to give to him.

24:42.949 --> 24:44.651
What? Wait, wha--
I don't understand.

24:44.684 --> 24:45.752
What kind of letter?

24:45.785 --> 24:47.754
You remember, Mommy.
This one!

24:47.787 --> 24:49.288
(stammers, laughs)

24:49.321 --> 24:50.790
You stole my letter?

24:50.823 --> 24:51.924
No.

24:51.958 --> 24:53.560
Stealing is wrong.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.062
JANE:
What?

24:56.095 --> 24:57.630
Just like it's wrong to say

24:57.664 --> 24:58.765
you're going to stay
out of something

24:58.798 --> 25:00.199
and then not
keep your word.

25:00.232 --> 25:01.300
That's lying.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.669
Do we lie?

25:02.702 --> 25:04.003
No.
No.
Sometimes.

25:04.036 --> 25:07.073
Well, we also agree
lying is wrong.

25:07.106 --> 25:08.608
But there is a difference
between lying

25:08.641 --> 25:09.609
and changing your mind.

25:09.642 --> 25:12.679
And we think the most
important thing is to put

25:12.712 --> 25:15.882
Daddy's well-being
above his wallet. Right, Mateo?

25:15.915 --> 25:17.684
PETRA:
Great.

25:17.717 --> 25:20.953
Then take care of his well-being
after the papers are signed.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.254
So they're not signed yet?

25:24.857 --> 25:26.025
(sighs)

25:26.058 --> 25:28.861
Just let it go, Jane.

25:28.895 --> 25:31.097
CRYSTAL:
The key is to never let go.

25:31.130 --> 25:33.700
Really squeeze the thighs.

25:33.733 --> 25:36.135
Why are there stripper poles
here?

25:36.168 --> 25:37.904
This is supposed to be a promo

25:37.937 --> 25:39.639
for a kids' performing arts
studio.

25:39.672 --> 25:40.840
CRYSTAL: They're not
stripper poles.

25:40.873 --> 25:41.674
That's just what they're called.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.910
Here, let me show
you what I have

25:43.943 --> 25:45.712
for the video.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.146
(sultry music playing)

25:49.181 --> 25:53.586
* He couldn't speak
a word of English *

25:53.620 --> 25:57.590
* But I could tell
by his sighs *

25:57.624 --> 26:02.995
* I couldn't speak
a word of Spanish *

26:03.029 --> 26:06.833
* And so we talked
with our eyes. *

26:06.866 --> 26:08.801
(music ends)

26:08.835 --> 26:10.169
You want to do that on camera?

26:10.202 --> 26:11.270
No, of course not.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.873
I want the kids to do it!

26:13.906 --> 26:15.808
They're children!

26:21.080 --> 26:22.281
Jane?

26:22.314 --> 26:24.016
Jane, could you put
your phone down?

26:24.050 --> 26:26.085
We're trying to teach the kids
it's rude to be on your phone.

26:26.118 --> 26:28.020
I found him!

26:28.054 --> 26:29.756
I can tell those ears anywhere.
And that tight shirt.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.157
And I know exactly where
the Shangri La is docked.

26:31.190 --> 26:32.892
What are you doing?

26:32.925 --> 26:33.993
I'm giving him my letter.

26:34.026 --> 26:35.294
He hasn't signed the deal yet.

26:35.327 --> 26:36.328
No, you can't.

26:36.362 --> 26:39.198
You can't.
Mateo, stay with tia Petra.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.167
Oh, no,
you don't.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.069
Rachel, watch the kids!

26:44.403 --> 26:45.872
(Petra yells)

26:46.673 --> 26:48.074
(grunts)

26:55.948 --> 26:57.083
Stop!

26:57.116 --> 26:58.317
A letter won't change his mind.

26:58.350 --> 27:00.219
Then why are you
trying to get it?

27:02.855 --> 27:04.356
Ah!

27:04.390 --> 27:05.892
No! (grunts)

27:05.925 --> 27:07.293
No!

27:07.326 --> 27:08.895
No!

27:08.928 --> 27:11.230
(laughs)

27:13.766 --> 27:15.034
Ah!

27:15.067 --> 27:16.936
(yelps)

27:20.206 --> 27:21.340
No!

27:22.942 --> 27:24.643
Oh...

27:26.178 --> 27:28.447
Ah! Ah!

27:28.480 --> 27:31.050
Are you crazy?!

27:31.083 --> 27:32.451
PETRA:
Just let it go, Jane!

27:32.484 --> 27:33.820
Give it to me!
JANE: It's okay!

27:33.853 --> 27:36.055
Mommies are just playing!

27:36.088 --> 27:37.089
PETRA:
Let it go!

27:37.123 --> 27:38.157
No! (grunts)

27:38.190 --> 27:39.191
Ha!

27:39.225 --> 27:41.227
(gasps)
Got it!

27:43.796 --> 27:45.932
Ha!

27:45.965 --> 27:48.334
Guess what?

27:48.367 --> 27:50.302
I memorized it!

27:50.336 --> 27:51.303
No!

27:51.337 --> 27:52.271
(giggling)
Jane!

27:53.840 --> 27:55.174
Wow.

27:55.207 --> 27:56.943
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah,
it's a real jungle out there.

27:56.976 --> 27:58.177
Jane! Jane!

27:58.210 --> 27:59.478
(upbeat music playing)

27:59.511 --> 28:01.047
* Run, run, run

28:01.080 --> 28:03.482
* You'll never get away.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.951
See?

28:04.984 --> 28:06.485
The kids can all be
mountain lions and wolves,

28:06.518 --> 28:08.454
and this way, we can do
some of the less explicit moves

28:08.487 --> 28:09.989
that you like to do.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.390
That's not very sexy.

28:11.423 --> 28:13.492
No, it isn't sexy,

28:13.525 --> 28:15.762
because again,
they're kids.

28:15.795 --> 28:18.197
But we can green-screen
the poles into trees,

28:18.230 --> 28:20.099
and make
a cool background forest.

28:20.132 --> 28:21.300
I don't know, Xo.

28:21.333 --> 28:22.869
It feels so random.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.403
Hi, there.

28:24.436 --> 28:26.305
Is everything all right?

28:26.338 --> 28:27.807
Can we take five?

28:27.840 --> 28:28.741
Fine with me.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.877
I'm gonna go vape.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.278
(sighs)

28:32.311 --> 28:33.813
What's going on?

28:33.846 --> 28:35.782
You hated Slutty Crystal
since you were teenagers

28:35.815 --> 28:37.383
and clearly nothing's changed.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.118
It's fine.
Why are you
working with her?

28:39.151 --> 28:41.053
I don't exactly have
a lot of options.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.955
Then take some time
and find a better one.

28:42.989 --> 28:44.256
I can't.
Why?

28:44.290 --> 28:46.125
Because I need to get
out of the house

28:46.158 --> 28:48.360
so that I don't get sucked
into the baby vortex.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.797
So...

28:50.830 --> 28:54.066
all this because you hate Fiona?

28:54.100 --> 28:55.134
What?

28:55.167 --> 28:57.403
I don't hate... Fiona.

28:57.436 --> 28:58.771
I don't think Fiona works.

28:58.805 --> 28:59.972
Look,

29:00.006 --> 29:01.307
it's the opposite, okay?

29:01.340 --> 29:02.809
I love this baby,

29:02.842 --> 29:04.043
whatever she's called.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.879
Oh, come on.

29:06.913 --> 29:10.416
How could I not with those
cute little chipmunk cheeks?

29:10.449 --> 29:11.884
But I know myself.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.285
If I'm not careful,

29:13.319 --> 29:16.422
I'll start to focus
on her, and her needs,

29:16.455 --> 29:18.557
and mine won't count as much.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.259
And...

29:20.292 --> 29:21.560
I'm scared

29:21.593 --> 29:22.995
of that happening.

29:23.029 --> 29:24.563
You know, again.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.132
Then let me help you.

29:26.165 --> 29:27.867
You don't need Slutty Crystal,

29:27.900 --> 29:29.902
you have Slutty Rogelio.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.904
I'm your partner.
And you have my word

29:31.938 --> 29:34.040
that if the baby starts
to become the focus,

29:34.073 --> 29:36.142
I will push you
out the door myself.

29:37.443 --> 29:40.312
Are we gonna rehearse
this thing or not?

29:40.346 --> 29:41.547
Uh...

29:43.482 --> 29:45.918
I'm sorry, Crystal.

29:45.952 --> 29:48.454
I just think we have different
visions for the studio.

29:48.487 --> 29:50.322
I don't think our partnership's
gonna work out.

29:50.356 --> 29:52.458
(sighs loudly)

29:52.491 --> 29:54.260
You know what?

29:54.293 --> 29:57.063
Everyone told me not to go
into business with Skanky Xo.

29:57.096 --> 29:59.866
Skanky Xo?!

29:59.899 --> 30:01.333
Oh...

30:01.367 --> 30:03.035
Hey.

30:03.069 --> 30:05.404
Should we work on the video
for your dance school?

30:05.437 --> 30:07.073
Drum up some business?

30:08.474 --> 30:09.608
I have a better idea.

30:09.641 --> 30:12.178
Okay, you're fierce.

30:12.211 --> 30:14.580
You're protecting
your chipmunk!

30:14.613 --> 30:16.348
Now there's a predator
approaching!

30:16.382 --> 30:18.084
Guard her!

30:18.117 --> 30:19.218
But happy guarding.

30:20.219 --> 30:23.189
And smize.

30:23.222 --> 30:25.091
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, the classic bond

30:25.124 --> 30:27.359
between a she-wolf
and her chipmunk.

30:27.393 --> 30:29.228
Yeah, I don't know what to say
about these two animals.

30:29.261 --> 30:30.963
Jane, if you blow this deal,
I will text Jeffrey

30:30.997 --> 30:32.364
and tell him never
to meet with you ever.

30:32.398 --> 30:34.901
What the hell are
you two doing here?!

30:34.934 --> 30:37.103
Nothing. We were just leaving.
We're here because
I'm scared for you, Rafael.

30:37.136 --> 30:39.038
You're not a user, but right
now, you're using Katherine,

30:39.071 --> 30:40.506
and the last time
you did something like this--

30:40.539 --> 30:42.441
something you knew was wrong--
you ended up in prison.

30:42.474 --> 30:45.644
And I don't want anything like
that to happen again because

30:45.677 --> 30:47.914
I love you,
and I know who you are.

30:47.947 --> 30:49.515
You are a good,
smart, decent person

30:49.548 --> 30:51.383
and a role model
for your children.

30:51.417 --> 30:54.086
For the last time, I am
doing this for my family!

30:54.120 --> 30:56.122
So, you need
to go back down

30:56.155 --> 30:59.225
to the kids club before
you blow my whole deal!

30:59.258 --> 31:00.960
Leave!

31:00.993 --> 31:03.362
Now!

31:20.579 --> 31:22.148
What's this?

31:22.181 --> 31:24.116
Open it!
(laughs)

31:28.955 --> 31:31.257
Cool!

31:54.280 --> 31:56.215
No.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.484
But I said everything
I wanted to say,

31:58.517 --> 32:01.587
and it was awful.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.389
He exploded.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.624
He is just convinced

32:05.657 --> 32:09.395
he's doing this big,
heroic thing for his family.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.230
Bueno.

32:21.240 --> 32:24.076
You were right.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.744
About Adam.

32:25.777 --> 32:28.680
I had this... fantasy,

32:28.714 --> 32:31.583
I guess, about him just
sliding right in.

32:31.617 --> 32:34.486
You know? Coming over
for family dinners and...

32:37.056 --> 32:38.557
He panicked.

32:38.590 --> 32:41.260
Because of Mateo.

32:41.293 --> 32:45.697
And he said he wanted a week
to think about things,

32:45.731 --> 32:47.733
and now it's been
seven days and...

32:47.766 --> 32:50.336
No, actually.

32:50.369 --> 32:52.271
Now he suddenly says he's ready.

32:52.304 --> 32:55.607
But I can't
do that to Mateo.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.176
I want to be with someone

32:57.209 --> 32:59.311
who sees him as a blessing,
not a burden.

32:59.345 --> 33:00.979
Bueno.

33:03.649 --> 33:04.516
What?

33:13.292 --> 33:15.627
Did you just call Adam mature?

33:15.661 --> 33:17.163
(sighs)

33:23.135 --> 33:25.304
I just don't want Mateo
to get hurt.

33:43.589 --> 33:45.191
When he said he was panicking,

33:45.224 --> 33:47.559
I felt exactly the same,
you know?

33:47.593 --> 33:51.463
Like when I was 19 and he left.

33:51.497 --> 33:53.732
JANE:
And part of me feels

33:53.765 --> 33:56.435
like you're going
to break my heart again.

33:56.468 --> 33:58.204
And that's the truth.

33:58.237 --> 34:02.174
And I'm a little scared.

34:02.208 --> 34:04.576
Yeah, me, too.
Real scared of all this.

34:04.610 --> 34:06.645
That's why I needed a minute.

34:08.747 --> 34:10.716
Yeah, I get that.

34:10.749 --> 34:14.720
But I am all in, Jane.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.455
Yeah?

34:35.307 --> 34:38.110
You ready to go to dinner?
Mm-hmm.

34:38.144 --> 34:40.379
(laughs)

34:40.779 --> 34:43.782
So, what does everyone think
the baby's name should be?

34:43.815 --> 34:45.617
Oh, Dad, no. Not again, please.
You've hated every
name you've tried.

34:45.651 --> 34:48.554
We're over it.
What do you think,
wise old owl?

34:48.587 --> 34:49.588
Who?

34:49.621 --> 34:51.857
(chuckles)
Exactly.

34:51.890 --> 34:54.460
You're already in character
for your photo shoot.

34:54.493 --> 34:55.827
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, trust me.

34:55.861 --> 34:57.596
You're gonna want to see this.

35:05.204 --> 35:07.139
Hmm?

35:11.610 --> 35:13.512
See?

35:13.545 --> 35:16.215
Are you the wise old owl
or what?

35:17.749 --> 35:19.818
Perdón. Wise owl.

35:19.851 --> 35:22.821
Gracias.

35:22.854 --> 35:25.724
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You know,
I can kind of see it now.

35:25.757 --> 35:27.459
What a hoot.

35:27.493 --> 35:30.162
All right, I will agree
to Amada for the first name

35:30.196 --> 35:31.597
if I can choose
the middle name.

35:31.630 --> 35:32.798
Something meaningful.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.333
I thought you
didn't like Amada

35:34.366 --> 35:36.268
because of the whole
Ryan Gosling feud thing.

35:36.302 --> 35:39.205
I've tried a million different
names; nothing stuck,

35:39.238 --> 35:41.273
so I will handle The Gos

35:41.307 --> 35:43.475
and stomach the wrath
of another ruthless Canadian.

35:43.509 --> 35:45.177
For the baby.

35:45.211 --> 35:47.813
Actually, I don't
even really like Amada anymore.

35:47.846 --> 35:49.748
This is getting ridiculous.
Our baby needs a name.

35:49.781 --> 35:52.518
I know!

35:54.520 --> 35:56.222
Come on, baby.

35:56.255 --> 35:57.723
Speak to us.

35:57.756 --> 35:59.691
What's your name, baby?
Tell me, baby.

35:59.725 --> 36:01.293
Talk to me, baby.

36:01.327 --> 36:02.894
(baby coos)

36:02.928 --> 36:06.365
Is it me, or does
Baby kind of work?

36:06.398 --> 36:08.534
Baby.

36:08.567 --> 36:12.238
It's perfect.

36:12.271 --> 36:13.939
Hi, Baby.

36:13.972 --> 36:17.776
Hello, beautiful Baby.

36:17.809 --> 36:20.846
So, what's that middle name
you had in mind?

36:22.013 --> 36:24.516
Darci and I would like
to introduce you all

36:24.550 --> 36:27.686
to the newest member
of our familia.

36:28.954 --> 36:31.690
Baby Michaelina

36:31.723 --> 36:33.792
De La Vega-Factor.

36:33.825 --> 36:36.395
Michaelina? After Michael?

36:36.428 --> 36:39.865
Well, he was
my best friend, so...

36:39.898 --> 36:41.867
Oh...

36:41.900 --> 36:43.569
Can I hold her?

36:43.602 --> 36:45.604
Yes.
(chuckles)

36:49.841 --> 36:52.010
(laughs)

36:52.043 --> 36:53.712
Hi, Michaelina.

36:53.745 --> 36:54.880
Baby Michaelina.

36:54.913 --> 36:57.583
Yes, yes, you are
a baby, Michaelina.

36:57.616 --> 36:59.418
No, it's Baby.

36:59.451 --> 37:00.886
Who?
ROGELIO:
First name, Baby.

37:00.919 --> 37:02.421
Middle name, Michaelina.

37:02.454 --> 37:03.955
Baby Michaelina.

37:03.989 --> 37:05.591
Oh.
Oh.

37:05.624 --> 37:07.659
Oh.

37:07.693 --> 37:11.297
Should we show them?
Yes.

37:11.330 --> 37:13.399
(whispers):
One, two, three.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.402
(chuckles)
(laughs)

37:18.837 --> 37:21.440
Hi.

37:21.473 --> 37:24.042
My baby sister,

37:24.075 --> 37:26.478
Baby.

37:28.514 --> 37:30.482
Hey.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.620
I'm putting my stuff in storage

37:34.653 --> 37:35.954
so you can have your house back.

37:35.987 --> 37:37.923
Oh.
And thank you

37:37.956 --> 37:39.425
for letting me stay here.

37:43.995 --> 37:46.398
Well, as soon as I have
this hotel deal in hand,

37:46.432 --> 37:49.435
I am getting you a trainer
and a gym membership.

37:52.738 --> 37:55.374
Right. Forgot.

37:55.407 --> 37:58.477
The Villanuevas
don't believe in money.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.352
Not Jane.

38:06.385 --> 38:08.354
She's constantly
telling me not to.

38:08.387 --> 38:09.855
But what she doesn't understand

38:09.888 --> 38:13.692
is that it's different
to have it and lose it.

38:18.697 --> 38:20.766
Who?

38:57.068 --> 38:58.537
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And speaking

38:58.570 --> 39:00.439
of losing something big...

39:02.441 --> 39:04.776
Okay, you ready to
light the tube?

39:04.810 --> 39:05.844
What is beautiful doctor doing?

39:08.447 --> 39:11.116
Carl, this is Anezka.

39:11.149 --> 39:12.718
Anezka...

39:12.751 --> 39:14.486
this is my friend Carl.

39:14.520 --> 39:17.556
Uh, nice to meeting you.

39:17.589 --> 39:18.857
We met in college.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.091
I wanted to show him my hotel.

39:20.125 --> 39:21.693
And he's also a fumigator,

39:21.727 --> 39:23.562
so I wanted to
get his opinion.

39:23.595 --> 39:26.498
And have a cigarette.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.166
I know I shouldn't smoke.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.168
(laughs):
But I'm trying not to drink.

39:30.201 --> 39:31.637
Anyway...

39:31.670 --> 39:33.138
Carl and I, we have to go. Bye.

39:33.171 --> 39:35.707
ANEZKA:
Mother...

39:35.741 --> 39:39.411
I think I just caught Dr. Luisa
trying to burn down hotel.

39:39.445 --> 39:40.679
What?

39:40.712 --> 39:42.147
But that's not even
craziest part.

39:42.180 --> 39:43.582
Dr. Luisa introduced me

39:43.615 --> 39:45.016
to her friend Carl,

39:45.050 --> 39:47.686
but there was no one there.

39:47.719 --> 39:50.922
She just be talking to the air.

39:50.956 --> 39:53.725
There is old saying in Czech:

39:53.759 --> 39:56.462
"If you talk to someone
who is not there,

39:56.495 --> 39:59.898
you are going crazy."

39:59.931 --> 40:01.467
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Speaking of talking to someone

40:01.500 --> 40:02.834
who's not all there...

40:02.868 --> 40:04.035
you know, emotionally.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.537
All you have to do

40:05.571 --> 40:07.439
is file the paperwork
with the lawyers,

40:07.473 --> 40:08.507
and that's it.

40:08.540 --> 40:10.942
The Marbella's ours.

40:10.976 --> 40:14.045
And I want to take you on a
trip to Greece to celebrate.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.647
We can make it a family trip.

40:15.681 --> 40:17.783
All the kids--
with the nannies, of course.

40:17.816 --> 40:19.518
Katherine, that's...
Family dinners.

40:19.551 --> 40:20.852
Private desserts.

40:20.886 --> 40:23.522
All you have to do is say yes.

40:26.157 --> 40:28.627
(owl hoots)

40:28.660 --> 40:30.596
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Now, was that a real owl

40:30.629 --> 40:32.531
or a Carl kind of owl?

40:32.564 --> 40:34.099
Who knows?

40:34.132 --> 40:35.901
The point is,

40:35.934 --> 40:38.036
with Alba's words
ringing in his ears,

40:38.069 --> 40:39.671
Rafael said...

40:39.705 --> 40:41.540
I think we should talk,
Katherine.

40:41.573 --> 40:43.775
About where we're going...

40:43.809 --> 40:45.911
or not going.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.112
What?

40:47.145 --> 40:50.482
I just want to step back.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.118
I thought you said

40:53.151 --> 40:55.120
you were falling for me.
I know.

40:55.153 --> 40:57.122
And, honestly,
I kind of panicked.

40:57.155 --> 40:59.124
You were so upset
about Jane,

40:59.157 --> 41:00.759
and I was anxious
about the deal,

41:00.792 --> 41:02.928
and I liked you, of course.

41:02.961 --> 41:05.096
But, look, I don't want
to be one of those people

41:05.130 --> 41:08.600
you were talking about
who just make you feel used.

41:08.634 --> 41:10.669
I want to be honest with you

41:10.702 --> 41:12.671
so that you go into this
with both eyes open.

41:12.704 --> 41:14.205
I know

41:14.239 --> 41:17.075
that you think this deal
is great for you financially,

41:17.108 --> 41:20.779
so I hope, on a business level,

41:20.812 --> 41:23.582
that we can still work together.

41:25.651 --> 41:27.986
Thank you
for your honesty, Rafael.

41:30.556 --> 41:32.023
I'll need to think about it.

41:32.057 --> 41:34.860
Of course.

41:41.933 --> 41:44.836
(engine starts)

41:48.106 --> 41:50.108
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, dear.

41:50.141 --> 41:51.843
Looks like that kitty
had claws.
