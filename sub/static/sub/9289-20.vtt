00:13.995 --> 00:16.665
Jack Bauer just called
with some new information.

00:16.748 --> 00:19.500
He has evidence the
Cyprus recording is counterfeit.

00:19.584 --> 00:20.995
I'm calling off the attack.

00:21.086 --> 00:25.795
Stopping and restarting military action could
cost tens of thousands of American lives.

00:25.882 --> 00:32.252
An acceptable risk if the alternative is
waging war against three innocent countries.

00:32.680 --> 00:35.801
What do you know about Section 4
of the 25th Amendment?

00:35.892 --> 00:39.937
If the majority of his Cabinet
feels he's unfit to fulfil his duties,

00:40.021 --> 00:42.144
the president could be removed from office.

00:42.232 --> 00:44.901
And the vice president
becomes acting president.

00:44.985 --> 00:48.484
As far as I'm concerned, it's Prescott
who should be charged with treason.

00:48.572 --> 00:51.656
- I was afraid you'd say that, Lynne.
- Mike!

00:51.741 --> 00:54.695
Until you hear from me,
do not let her out.

00:55.162 --> 00:58.531
I can lure them away from here.
You and Kate get the chip over to CTU.

00:58.623 --> 01:03.084
Meet me at Moorpark and Vineland. If I'm not
there in 15 minutes, get it to Tony Almeida.

01:03.170 --> 01:05.411
Yusuf! Behind you!

01:05.504 --> 01:08.257
He's a damn towel head.

01:08.341 --> 01:10.381
Stop it!

01:10.844 --> 01:13.798
We got the evidence that proves
the Cyprus audio was forged.

01:13.889 --> 01:17.554
It's a memory chip containing
the original source recordings.

01:18.435 --> 01:21.270
Do not kill him until he talks.

01:21.354 --> 01:23.892
Jack, I need the chip.

01:23.982 --> 01:26.734
It's not for sale. My answer's final.

01:26.818 --> 01:30.483
When Ronnie's finished,
you'll give me another.

01:30.572 --> 01:32.648
The chip, Jack.

01:34.910 --> 01:36.108
He's dead.

01:44.586 --> 01:46.792
If you are just joining us,

01:46.880 --> 01:50.296
the White House has confirmed
the blast in the Mojave Desert

01:50.383 --> 01:57.631
that occurred four hours ago at 10.59pm PST
was in fact a nuclear explosion.

02:02.938 --> 02:07.185
We'll stitch you up
and get you out of here and on your way.

02:07.275 --> 02:10.525
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for epinephrine.

02:10.612 --> 02:13.281
This is a treatment room.
I have a patient...

02:16.118 --> 02:19.035
- Where's the epinephrine?
- Storage room.

02:19.121 --> 02:21.243
Let's go.

02:23.792 --> 02:26.117
Clear.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.458
Nothing.

02:30.549 --> 02:33.253
Go again. Increase the joules.

02:33.343 --> 02:35.881
You are not gonna die on me,
you son of a bitch.

02:37.013 --> 02:41.142
- That's Kingsley. You talk to him.
- Yes?

02:41.226 --> 02:44.180
- Let me talk to Stark.
- He's a little busy, sir.

02:44.271 --> 02:47.355
- Did Bauer give you the chip?
- No, sir. Not yet.

02:47.441 --> 02:48.983
What's taking so long?

02:49.067 --> 02:50.976
It's under control.

02:51.069 --> 02:54.106
What am I hearing in your voice?

02:54.197 --> 02:56.771
Answer me, Raymond.

02:56.867 --> 02:58.693
Stark pushed Bauer too far.

02:58.785 --> 03:01.359
He's flat-lining.

03:01.455 --> 03:04.206
Whatever he broke, he'd better fix.

03:04.291 --> 03:07.624
And if Ronnie can't handle it,
do it yourself.

03:15.761 --> 03:18.430
- Where's the epinephrine?
- The doctor's got it.

03:18.513 --> 03:23.638
- If you don't revive this man, you're dead.
- I need your men to put him on the gurney.

03:23.727 --> 03:26.348
Put him up on the gurney.

03:26.438 --> 03:29.011
Give him as much as he can take.

03:38.700 --> 03:41.025
Let's go! Let's go!

03:49.628 --> 03:52.545
What are you waiting for? Do it!

03:55.884 --> 03:58.457
Give him the paddles.

04:02.057 --> 04:03.848
Clear.

04:07.229 --> 04:09.387
Still in v-fib.

04:09.481 --> 04:11.390
Hit him again!

04:11.483 --> 04:14.056
Clear.

04:18.240 --> 04:21.656
- It's too late. It's not gonna work.
- Hit him again!

04:25.330 --> 04:27.406
Clear.

04:30.168 --> 04:32.790
Come on. Come on.

04:33.338 --> 04:35.911
I got a sinus rhythm.

04:36.007 --> 04:39.376
I need a Baxter set
and a bag of normal saline.

04:51.356 --> 04:54.025
What did Kingsley say?

04:54.109 --> 04:56.730
He said I just got promoted.

05:06.246 --> 05:07.705
Hey, Jack.

05:10.959 --> 05:13.273
You thought death would save you.

05:13.473 --> 05:16.629
You're not gonna die
until I kill you myself.

05:16.715 --> 05:19.918
Now, where is that chip?

05:24.181 --> 05:26.672
We'll be convening the Cabinet
within the hour.

05:26.767 --> 05:29.388
Does the president
have any idea what's going on?

05:29.478 --> 05:34.353
- I don't think so.
- It's critical he doesn't find out.

05:34.441 --> 05:36.766
It's not going to be that easy.

05:36.860 --> 05:40.478
Lynne Kresge was about to warn him,
but I was able to intervene.

05:40.572 --> 05:42.648
Where is she now?

05:42.741 --> 05:45.232
I had to put her under guard.

05:47.120 --> 05:50.738
I know it's difficult.
It's difficult for all of us.

05:51.875 --> 05:55.540
- I just hope we're doing the right thing.
- Mike.

05:55.629 --> 06:00.089
Do you think these are the circumstances
in which I wish to assume the presidency?

06:00.175 --> 06:02.132
You know me better than that.

06:02.552 --> 06:06.336
This country was attacked,
with a nuclear weapon.

06:06.431 --> 06:09.800
And the president will not commit
to a military response.

06:10.977 --> 06:14.393
I hope you're not wavering yourself.

06:14.481 --> 06:17.186
No. I'm not.

06:17.275 --> 06:19.398
Good.

06:19.486 --> 06:24.397
So, your responsibility is to make sure that
the Cabinet votes to remove him from office.

06:24.491 --> 06:28.034
I have a responsibility to make
sure the vote takes place,

06:28.234 --> 06:30.161
not to manipulate the outcome.

06:30.247 --> 06:32.405
Poor choice of words.

06:32.499 --> 06:34.575
But my point is the same.

06:35.335 --> 06:39.914
You're doing the right thing, Mike.
History will recognise that.

06:50.225 --> 06:54.768
- Anything from Jack Bauer?
- Not that I've heard.

06:55.981 --> 06:58.020
Mike...

06:58.108 --> 07:02.817
I know you think delaying
a military response is the wrong call.

07:02.904 --> 07:06.404
Only because you're
relying on a single source.

07:06.491 --> 07:10.987
Jack Bauer says he has evidence
that we're being manipulated into this war.

07:11.079 --> 07:16.074
I have to give him the opportunity
to produce the proof.

07:16.168 --> 07:21.328
If there were anything I could say
to make you change your mind...

07:21.423 --> 07:23.499
There isn't.

07:24.593 --> 07:26.051
Look, Mike,

07:26.136 --> 07:30.050
I know this is an unpopular decision.

07:30.140 --> 07:36.178
And even though you don't agree either,
your standing by me means a great deal.

07:38.523 --> 07:41.560
Send Lynne into my office.
She's drafting my statement.

07:41.651 --> 07:45.696
- I'll see if I can find her.
- What do you mean?

07:45.781 --> 07:51.202
She wasn't feeling well. She took
a few minutes' downtime last I heard.

07:51.286 --> 07:53.492
That's fine. Let her rest.

07:53.580 --> 07:56.830
I'll go over it with Jenny.

08:03.507 --> 08:09.093
Please open this door. Whoever you are,
you are conspiring against the US president.

08:09.179 --> 08:11.931
Do you have any idea what that means?

08:12.015 --> 08:13.972
Hello?

08:14.059 --> 08:17.973
You have no idea what's at stake here.
Please open the door!

08:53.306 --> 08:55.880
Hey, get his wallet.

09:01.231 --> 09:03.105
- How much?
- A couple of hundred.

09:03.191 --> 09:05.647
- Come on.
- Let's go.

09:05.735 --> 09:08.061
- What's this?
- Let's get out of here.

09:08.155 --> 09:10.693
- Come on!
- Just take it. Let's go.

09:12.409 --> 09:15.114
- Get in the car. I'm driving.
- The chip...

09:15.579 --> 09:20.241
Wait. Wait!
You took something from him. It's mine.

09:20.333 --> 09:21.951
Why are you with him anyway?

09:22.651 --> 09:25.328
Only thing worse than these
bastards is people like you.

09:25.422 --> 09:29.835
No. No, no, it's not like that. I just need
that plastic case you took from him.

09:29.926 --> 09:31.551
- This?
- Yeah.

09:33.305 --> 09:35.381
This? What is it?

09:35.474 --> 09:41.761
It's got information on it. It's not worth
anything. Please, come on. Give it to me.

09:41.855 --> 09:43.931
What'll you give us for it?

09:44.024 --> 09:46.230
I'll pay you. I've got money.

09:46.777 --> 09:49.314
- How much?
- It's not here, it's at my house.

09:49.404 --> 09:52.358
Forget it, Marcus. Let's just go.

09:52.449 --> 09:55.154
- Where's your house?
- Hancock Park.

09:55.243 --> 09:58.743
It's not that far from here.

09:59.706 --> 10:01.912
Come on.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.578
Come on.

10:03.668 --> 10:07.002
Yeah, let's do it. Let's go get your money.

10:07.088 --> 10:11.169
- First I'm gonna put him out of his misery.
- No. No!

10:13.804 --> 10:17.932
- This is for messin' with our country.
- Oh, please!

10:18.016 --> 10:21.100
- No!
- Marcus, man, come on.

10:27.526 --> 10:29.851
Come on, let's go.

11:31.756 --> 11:37.462
I'm sorry. All circuits are busy.
Please try your call again later.

11:41.516 --> 11:44.766
- Give him more epinephrine.
- He's already had too much.

11:44.853 --> 11:47.309
He's strong. He can handle it.

11:57.991 --> 12:02.736
- Now prepare a syringe of beroglide.
- Beroglide? It'll collapse his lungs...

12:02.829 --> 12:05.320
Just do it.

12:16.176 --> 12:20.008
Now, this beroglide stuff, it's amazing.

12:20.097 --> 12:25.435
This will paralyse your diaphragm,
and you'll slowly suffocate.

12:26.061 --> 12:30.639
You'll feel like you're drowning,
until you tell me where the chip is.

12:30.732 --> 12:34.564
I already told you,
I don't know where the chip is.

12:35.278 --> 12:37.567
Kingsley wants to talk to you.

12:37.656 --> 12:39.898
I'll be right back.

12:48.792 --> 12:51.247
- Help me loosen the rope.
- What?

12:51.336 --> 12:54.871
- Help me undo the rope.
- I can't do that.

12:55.966 --> 12:58.770
He's on the phone.
The other guys are far enough away.

12:58.870 --> 13:01.470
They'll just think you're working on me.

13:01.555 --> 13:04.971
- Please. This is the only chance we've got.
- He'll kill me.

13:05.058 --> 13:07.763
He's gonna kill you anyway.

13:07.853 --> 13:11.685
These men were willing to kill
millions of people earlier tonight.

13:11.773 --> 13:15.142
I am the only chance you've got
to get out of here alive.

13:15.235 --> 13:17.726
We don't have any time. Come on.

13:17.821 --> 13:19.814
Do it.

13:23.410 --> 13:27.408
Feed it through the bottom. Hurry.

13:29.666 --> 13:31.244
Hurry.

13:33.086 --> 13:34.913
He's coming.

13:36.089 --> 13:39.007
- What are you doing?
- I had to disconnect his IV first.

13:39.092 --> 13:41.666
- Get the beroglide.
- Yes, sir.

13:46.391 --> 13:48.965
Start him off with 2cc.

14:19.299 --> 14:20.793
- Mr Chappelle.
- Hi.

14:20.884 --> 14:24.051
- Is Tony in his office?
- He went to IT. He'll be a minute.

14:24.137 --> 14:27.423
- What's the status on the phones?
- Grid's down in most of the city.

14:27.516 --> 14:30.719
- How about wireless?
- Cell service is pretty much out too.

14:30.811 --> 14:32.969
- Are you using Satcom?
- Yeah.

14:33.063 --> 14:35.106
Save Satcom for your highest priorities.

14:35.206 --> 14:37.808
We're sharing it with half
a dozen other agencies.

14:37.901 --> 14:39.561
OK.

14:39.653 --> 14:41.480
Tony.

14:41.571 --> 14:43.231
Hey, Ryan.

14:43.323 --> 14:46.158
Good work.

14:46.243 --> 14:48.116
Good work on what?

14:48.203 --> 14:52.414
I know Bauer's trying to change
our position on the Cyprus audio.

14:52.499 --> 14:55.915
- That's not exactly true.
- Whatever. You don't have to explain.

14:56.002 --> 14:59.703
I'm just glad you're not
letting the tail wag the dog.

14:59.798 --> 15:02.205
Ryan, uh...

15:02.300 --> 15:04.756
Jack may not be wrong about this. He's...

15:04.845 --> 15:07.632
Wait. Wait. I don't wanna hear that.

15:09.057 --> 15:12.307
We're about to bomb
the Middle East into next Wednesday.

15:12.394 --> 15:15.311
We're supposed to be
processing intel to support that.

15:15.397 --> 15:19.181
- I've got most of my people on it.
- I want all your people on it.

15:19.276 --> 15:24.981
Don't you think we need to eliminate doubt
about the authenticity of this recording?

15:25.073 --> 15:29.782
Your department has already
authenticated that recording.

15:29.870 --> 15:33.404
Don't make me the bad guy here, Tony.

15:33.498 --> 15:38.493
Mason may have recommended you to direct
CTU, but you'll need my blessing to stay on.

15:38.587 --> 15:42.003
I assume that's what you want.

15:42.090 --> 15:45.708
What I want is to do
what's right in this situation.

15:46.553 --> 15:49.969
What's right is
to follow the chain of command.

15:50.056 --> 15:53.176
Put everyone on domestic response.

16:56.623 --> 16:57.572
No!

16:57.666 --> 16:59.705
- God damn it!
- Calm down.

17:14.391 --> 17:19.385
What do you mean,
you can't get through to him?

17:19.479 --> 17:24.307
- Unreachable? I want him now.
- I'll try again, sir.

17:31.867 --> 17:33.527
Aaron?

17:36.413 --> 17:39.367
- Yes, Mr President?
- Close the door, please.

17:50.302 --> 17:55.213
- How many presidents have you worked for?
- I came in on Reagan's second term.

17:58.769 --> 18:04.355
I haven't been able to establish contact
with my vice president in the last half-hour.

18:04.441 --> 18:07.311
What do you make of that?

18:07.402 --> 18:11.352
I wouldn't know how to respond
to that, Mr President.

18:12.824 --> 18:17.985
I just pulled our bombers out of the air,
against everyone's recommendations.

18:18.079 --> 18:21.662
Now my vice president
suddenly is unreachable.

18:21.750 --> 18:23.402
Should I draw any conclusions?

18:23.802 --> 18:26.246
Sir,
I'm not qualified to give an opinion...

18:26.338 --> 18:30.038
Aaron, you've been doing this
nearly 20 years.

18:30.133 --> 18:33.253
You know how the system works.

18:33.345 --> 18:36.511
Is Prescott planning something
behind my back?

18:39.476 --> 18:42.992
I'm going 20-10,
please cover position three.

18:43.192 --> 18:44.470
Roger that.

18:47.317 --> 18:52.560
For what it's worth, I think the choices
you've made today have been the right ones.

18:52.656 --> 18:54.226
That's not what I asked.

18:54.426 --> 18:57.567
There are always those
in the administration

18:57.661 --> 19:00.496
who feel that delay is a weakness.

19:00.580 --> 19:02.855
If enough individuals share
this point of view, then...

19:02.997 --> 19:04.412
Aaron.

19:04.501 --> 19:07.418
Is Prescott coming after me?

19:08.588 --> 19:10.747
I'm not sure.

19:10.841 --> 19:16.179
But you have good instincts, sir.
I'd listen to 'em if I were you.

19:18.014 --> 19:20.932
- Thank you, Aaron.
- Yes, sir.

19:42.330 --> 19:44.370
Max is very unhappy.

19:44.458 --> 19:47.328
Max can be unhappy.
We're all entitled to our feelings.

19:47.419 --> 19:51.286
Peter, spare me your usual
metaphysical observations.

19:51.381 --> 19:56.755
Our entire project depends on military
action the president just suspended.

19:56.845 --> 20:00.095
- For now.
- Now is all that matters.

20:00.182 --> 20:03.052
Now you're being metaphysical.

20:03.143 --> 20:04.092
Peter...

20:04.186 --> 20:09.428
Palmer won't be able to stand the political
pressure from his own administration,

20:09.524 --> 20:12.062
let alone the will of the people.

20:12.152 --> 20:16.019
He's not gonna have any choice
but to respond to the nuclear weapon.

20:16.114 --> 20:23.362
You're assuming that this man Bauer
hasn't already delivered proof to his people

20:23.455 --> 20:27.239
that the Cyprus audio was false.

20:27.334 --> 20:29.540
Bauer won't be a problem.

20:41.181 --> 20:43.358
Tell me where the chip is,
I'll make it stop.

20:43.558 --> 20:44.597
You gonna kill him.

20:44.684 --> 20:47.935
No. But he'll wish he'd stayed dead.

20:48.855 --> 20:52.189
I'm all done playing games with you.

20:52.275 --> 20:54.648
Now tell me what I wanna know! Tell me!

20:54.736 --> 20:59.279
- They'll hear you upstairs.
- Then shut up and close the door!

20:59.950 --> 21:03.401
Fill the syringe and double the dosage.

21:20.178 --> 21:22.467
I'll tell you where the chip is.

21:25.434 --> 21:27.556
Where?

21:28.937 --> 21:30.479
Again.

21:31.356 --> 21:33.598
It's in...

21:34.276 --> 21:35.556
It's in a p...

21:35.652 --> 21:38.225
What did you say?

21:38.321 --> 21:40.610
They're taking the chip to...

21:40.699 --> 21:43.486
They're taking it where?

22:15.984 --> 22:18.024
Stay down.

22:21.615 --> 22:24.366
How much longer has he got
before he's dead?

22:24.451 --> 22:26.942
As long as 15 minutes.

22:46.765 --> 22:51.343
You tell me who was on the other end
of that phone, and I'll make it quick.

22:58.527 --> 23:01.611
Peter... Kingsley.

23:36.148 --> 23:41.390
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Yes. Close the door, please.

23:41.486 --> 23:43.562
Have a seat, Mike.

23:45.991 --> 23:49.775
I've been feeling a little disconnected
from my people in the last hour.

23:49.870 --> 23:55.112
I've been managing the Joint Chiefs and
Homeland Security. If you want me closer...

23:55.208 --> 23:58.542
Not you, Mike. Back in Washington.

23:58.628 --> 24:02.128
- Who?
- Prescott.

24:02.215 --> 24:04.706
I think he's avoiding me.

24:06.052 --> 24:10.465
With what we've gone through
in the last 18 hours,

24:10.557 --> 24:13.428
he's just being pulled
in ten different directions.

24:13.518 --> 24:18.264
We were, and in some ways still are,
on the brink of war.

24:18.356 --> 24:24.027
I'm the commander in chief.
When I call, there's only one direction.

24:24.112 --> 24:27.315
Absolutely. I'll get him
on the phone right away.

24:27.407 --> 24:30.408
Do that. Oh, and Mike?

24:30.494 --> 24:33.863
This statement that Jenny made a pass on,
it's not working.

24:33.955 --> 24:36.909
- What's the problem?
- The facts aren't updated.

24:37.000 --> 24:42.207
And I don't think Jenny's been apprised
of everything. I want Lynne to go over it.

24:42.297 --> 24:45.049
Why don't you give it to me?
I'll get it to her.

24:45.133 --> 24:47.209
Thank you.

25:21.253 --> 25:22.248
Prescott.

25:22.337 --> 25:25.706
It's Mike Novick. Can you talk?

25:25.799 --> 25:27.423
Yeah.

25:27.509 --> 25:30.960
- Are you going forward or not?
- Of course. Nothing's changed.

25:31.054 --> 25:35.431
- The sooner you can execute, the better.
- We're going as fast as we can here.

25:35.517 --> 25:40.060
David Palmer is not a stupid man.
He knows something is going on.

25:40.147 --> 25:43.266
It won't take him long
to figure out what it is.

25:43.358 --> 25:44.452
How does he know?

25:44.652 --> 25:47.059
For one thing,
you haven't returned his calls.

25:47.154 --> 25:50.024
- I'll call him now.
- I think that's a good idea.

25:50.490 --> 25:55.448
Mike, I'm counting on you. You gotta keep
him busy until I can get everyone together.

25:55.537 --> 25:59.321
- How much longer?
- A half-hour. 45 minutes tops.

25:59.833 --> 26:03.665
The sooner the better.
I'm all alone out here on this.

26:03.753 --> 26:07.122
He's asking about Lynne.
I can't keep up the act much longer.

26:07.215 --> 26:11.343
You won't have to. Just hold your mud, Mike.

26:27.194 --> 26:30.278
- CTU. Dessler.
- It's Jack. I need to speakto Tony.

26:30.363 --> 26:32.736
J... Jack?

26:32.824 --> 26:36.071
Michelle,
I don't know if you can still hear me.

26:36.771 --> 26:38.448
Kate and Yusuf have got the chip.

26:38.538 --> 26:41.535
I'm going to Vineland and Moorpark,

26:42.035 --> 26:45.371
just in case they're still
waiting for me there.

26:45.462 --> 26:47.787
Michelle?

26:47.881 --> 26:49.505
Damn it.

26:49.591 --> 26:51.465
Jack?

27:01.895 --> 27:03.140
Tony?

27:03.230 --> 27:05.721
- What's up?
- Call just came through from Jack.

27:05.816 --> 27:07.607
- What'd he say?
- We lost the signal.

27:07.692 --> 27:11.108
- You try him back?
- Yeah. I put an auto-trace on the number.

27:11.196 --> 27:15.324
See if Dispatch picked it up in the log.
Find out if it was a cell or land line.

27:15.408 --> 27:17.401
OK.

27:17.494 --> 27:19.570
Yes, sir.

27:21.498 --> 27:23.574
What's that all about?

27:23.667 --> 27:26.537
Jack Bauer tried to contact us.
We lost connection.

27:26.628 --> 27:29.878
I said I don't want Bauer
distracting you or your resources.

27:29.965 --> 27:32.456
Whatever he's doing out there is irrelevant.

27:32.551 --> 27:33.724
I'm not so sure it is.

27:34.324 --> 27:37.177
Jack says he's got proof that
the Cyprus audio was fabricated.

27:37.264 --> 27:41.511
- He's bringing it here within the hour.
- If he's got proof, let him produce it.

27:41.601 --> 27:45.136
But I want you
to keep your eye on the ball, Tony.

27:53.029 --> 27:56.481
Jim, we both know you've been
one of the most outspoken opponents

27:56.575 --> 27:58.698
to my decision to call off this attack.

27:58.785 --> 28:02.700
Any criticisms I may have had
have been expressed behind closed doors,

28:02.789 --> 28:04.948
out of reach of any public scrutiny.

28:05.041 --> 28:09.585
I know we haven't had a chance to talk
one-on-one since all this began.

28:09.671 --> 28:14.547
So if you have something
to tell me, go ahead.

28:15.677 --> 28:17.753
There's nothing, sir.

28:18.388 --> 28:20.844
My door is always open, Jim.

28:20.932 --> 28:25.594
If you have something to say,
I would expect you to bring it to me first.

28:25.687 --> 28:29.270
- Of course, Mr President.
- Thanks for getting back to me.

28:33.737 --> 28:38.814
- I still don't trust him.
- What do you want me to do?

28:38.909 --> 28:42.112
- Sorry to interrupt, sir.
- What is it?

28:42.204 --> 28:46.497
Lynne Kresge is injured.
She fell down some stairs.

28:46.583 --> 28:48.492
- What happened?
- We're not sure.

28:48.585 --> 28:52.001
It appears she may have been running
from a fire in an upstairs room.

28:52.088 --> 28:55.125
- Is she OK?
- On-site physician says she's critical.

28:55.217 --> 28:57.293
Show me where.

29:27.165 --> 29:30.083
So, what'd you find out from Dispatch?

29:30.168 --> 29:37.215
Well, Jack called me from a cell. Came from
somewhere between Encino and Studio City.

29:37.300 --> 29:41.345
OK, so he was in an urgent care centre
right around here about two hours ago.

29:41.430 --> 29:45.926
- To get to CTU he'd take the 101 or the 5.
- Do you want me to pull up the satellite?

29:46.017 --> 29:48.596
No, that would raise
a red flag with Chappelle,

29:48.696 --> 29:50.098
which is the last thing I need.

29:50.188 --> 29:55.609
What about police channels? If he couldn't
contact us, maybe he tried someone local.

29:55.694 --> 29:59.145
Can you monitor those
without being detected?

29:59.781 --> 30:01.857
Yeah.

30:02.784 --> 30:04.900
All right. Focus on
the downtown precincts.

30:05.395 --> 30:06.449
OK.

30:56.630 --> 30:58.373
Yusuf!

30:58.465 --> 31:00.007
Jack, they took the chip.

31:00.091 --> 31:02.843
What are you talking about? Where's Kate?

31:02.928 --> 31:06.510
They took her to her house. Hancock Park.

31:07.265 --> 31:10.183
She offered to exchange money for the chip.

31:10.268 --> 31:13.768
- Come on, let's get you out of here.
- Jack, I'm not gonna make it.

31:13.855 --> 31:19.146
- Go and get the chip, Jack.
- Yusuf, just hang on. Just hang on.

31:19.236 --> 31:22.735
Yusuf, come on. Yusuf, hang on!

31:23.240 --> 31:25.316
Yusuf!

31:36.545 --> 31:38.621
Yusuf, I'm sorry.

31:40.298 --> 31:42.872
I'm sorry.

31:59.151 --> 32:01.724
All right, let's go.

32:01.820 --> 32:04.228
Everybody, be cool.

32:07.492 --> 32:09.284
- You live here?
- Yes.

32:09.369 --> 32:11.362
- By yourself?
- Yes.

32:11.455 --> 32:13.328
Damn.

32:19.296 --> 32:21.004
I don't have my keys.

32:21.089 --> 32:23.794
- Is this really your house?
- Yes.

32:25.761 --> 32:28.880
There's a spare key under the pot.

32:36.354 --> 32:39.854
- Get inside. Get in here! Shut it off.
- She's setting us up, man.

32:39.941 --> 32:43.560
I said, shut it off. Shut it off!

32:43.653 --> 32:46.773
- What's the code?
- 51224.

32:46.865 --> 32:49.438
51224.

32:53.747 --> 32:56.499
Show us where the money's at.

33:03.548 --> 33:05.457
Doctor, what's her status?

33:05.550 --> 33:08.218
She sustained some sort
of neurological damage.

33:08.418 --> 33:10.461
We won't know the extent till
we get her to the hospital.

33:10.555 --> 33:12.881
- Will she live?
- It's too early to say.

33:12.974 --> 33:15.762
- Can I talk to her?
- That may not be a good idea.

33:15.852 --> 33:18.639
- I asked the doctor a question.
- You can try.

33:18.730 --> 33:21.731
But she's slipping
in and out of consciousness.

33:21.817 --> 33:23.525
Lynne.

33:23.735 --> 33:25.942
Lynne.

33:27.155 --> 33:29.646
Lynne, it's me. David Palmer.

33:34.371 --> 33:36.447
I'm so sorry.

33:41.044 --> 33:46.335
We're getting you to the hospital,
but I need you to tell me how this happened.

33:46.424 --> 33:52.926
Sir, she took a severe blow to the head.
She has a concussion and she's not coherent.

33:53.014 --> 33:56.383
- She's trying to say something.
- D... D... D...

33:56.476 --> 33:59.845
It's OK. I'm here. I'm listening.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.971
What is it, Lynne?

34:04.776 --> 34:06.852
What is it?

34:22.460 --> 34:25.212
It's all right, Lynne.

34:25.755 --> 34:28.875
They're going to take good care of you.

34:30.844 --> 34:34.342
- We need to get her to the hospital.
- Go.

34:50.572 --> 34:52.446
Come on, Tony. Pick up the phone.

34:52.532 --> 34:56.315
- I'm sorry. All services are busy.
- Damn it!

35:14.137 --> 35:18.349
- Chappelle's going to find out.
- What are you talking about?

35:18.433 --> 35:24.518
He said not to waste time looking for Jack,
but that's all you and Michelle are doing.

35:24.606 --> 35:26.895
Why aren't you working on the field intel?

35:26.983 --> 35:30.684
Don't shine me on.
I'm trying to help you keep your job.

35:30.779 --> 35:33.566
Really? By doing what?

35:34.199 --> 35:37.532
- Not saying anything.
- OK.

35:37.619 --> 35:39.908
Then don't say anything.

35:39.996 --> 35:41.028
Um...

35:41.123 --> 35:44.040
I want something in return.

35:46.128 --> 35:50.256
- And what would that be?
- Michelle worked for me at District.

35:50.340 --> 35:52.878
Things worked much better that way.

35:52.968 --> 35:55.379
She's not qualified to be my boss.

35:55.779 --> 35:59.338
That's why things have been
so messed up here tonight.

35:59.433 --> 36:01.840
So, uh...

36:01.935 --> 36:05.684
you want Michelle's job.
Is that what this is about?

36:05.772 --> 36:08.442
Yes.

36:08.525 --> 36:11.645
And I assume you wanna keep yours.

36:12.988 --> 36:14.861
Yeah.

36:16.408 --> 36:19.824
Mr Chappelle, could you
come over here a second?

36:19.911 --> 36:21.987
What do you need, Almeida?

36:22.080 --> 36:25.698
Carrie's got something
she wants to tell you.

36:32.299 --> 36:34.837
What is it, Carrie?

36:39.222 --> 36:40.716
Well?

36:42.517 --> 36:46.895
Carrie tried to extort a promotion out of me
by promising to keep her mouth shut.

36:46.980 --> 36:49.269
That about right?

36:49.941 --> 36:53.310
Mouth shut about what?

36:53.403 --> 36:56.190
He and Michelle are still
trying to find Jack Bauer.

36:56.281 --> 36:59.415
I was trying to give Tony
the courtesy of a warning.

37:00.415 --> 37:01.951
I was gonna tell you, Mr Chappelle...

37:02.037 --> 37:05.536
That's enough, Carrie. Get back to work.

37:05.624 --> 37:07.700
Yes, sir.

37:09.294 --> 37:12.829
Thought I made myself clear, Tony.
We're past Bauer.

37:12.923 --> 37:15.378
No, sir. You are. I'm not.

37:15.467 --> 37:16.979
I'm still director of CTU.

37:17.079 --> 37:19.796
I'm allocating resources to
ensure we have all the facts.

37:19.888 --> 37:26.140
If you're not comfortable with me making
my own decisions, relieve me of my duties.

37:28.105 --> 37:30.596
That won't be necessary.

37:31.691 --> 37:33.518
- Thank you, sir.
- Don't thank me.

37:33.610 --> 37:37.560
I just don't have anyone
to take your place right now.

37:38.490 --> 37:41.610
I don't like insubordination.

37:54.798 --> 37:57.087
Come on.

37:58.385 --> 38:00.627
You better hurry up.

38:00.720 --> 38:03.009
It's there.

38:05.225 --> 38:08.345
- What the hell is this?
- There's at least 20,000 euros.

38:08.437 --> 38:10.643
- Euros?
- It's European money.

38:10.730 --> 38:14.977
- I look European to you? Where's the cash?
- That is cash. It's as good as dollars.

38:15.068 --> 38:17.773
We want cash money. You understand me?

38:17.863 --> 38:19.820
Marcus?

38:25.871 --> 38:29.619
- You think this is real?
- No, they keep the fake ones locked up

38:29.708 --> 38:31.831
1500.

38:31.918 --> 38:35.003
- That's it?
- That's it.

38:35.088 --> 38:37.793
Now what do we do?

38:46.349 --> 38:48.757
Look, just take it all.

38:48.852 --> 38:51.604
Just gimme the chip.

38:52.355 --> 38:54.395
She knows what we look like.

38:54.483 --> 38:57.104
She knows our names too.

38:57.194 --> 39:00.610
- We had a deal.
- He's right. We can't just leave you here.

39:00.697 --> 39:05.276
Take everything! I won't tell anyone.
I won't tell the police, I promise.

39:05.368 --> 39:07.906
Just give me the chip!

39:07.996 --> 39:10.202
Don't do this. Let's take the stuff and go.

39:10.290 --> 39:12.954
The second we walk out of here,
she's calling the cops.

39:13.154 --> 39:14.584
I can't get locked up again man.

39:14.669 --> 39:16.377
No!

39:32.979 --> 39:35.470
- No!
- Gimme that!

39:40.529 --> 39:44.740
- Kate, are you all right?
- Yeah. They've got the chip.

39:44.825 --> 39:48.194
- How many rooms at the end of the hall?
- Two. Bedroom and bathroom.

39:48.286 --> 39:49.697
Stay down.

40:06.221 --> 40:08.794
All I want is the chip!

40:23.947 --> 40:27.814
My name is Jack Bauer. I'm a federal agent.

40:27.909 --> 40:31.444
All I want is the chip,
and then I'll let you go.

40:33.874 --> 40:37.077
You shot my friend, man.
You expect me to believe you?

40:37.169 --> 40:40.169
Right now you don't have a choice.

40:41.047 --> 40:47.086
You come in here and I'm gonna smash
this thing. I'll put it right under my foot.

40:50.515 --> 40:56.719
We're looking for Jack Bauer. He was on
a cellphone between Encino and Studio City.

40:56.813 --> 41:03.065
We need to find him as soon as possible.
I need everyone to make this priority one.

41:15.040 --> 41:18.575
Ladies and gentlemen, we can begin.

41:20.796 --> 41:24.046
I'd like to thank you
for assembling at such short notice.

41:24.132 --> 41:28.000
I'm sure you're all wondering
why I've asked you here,

41:28.095 --> 41:31.878
why I've asked you to keep
the news of this meeting to yourselves.

41:31.973 --> 41:35.639
Excuse me, Mr Vice President.
Shouldn't we wait for the president?

41:35.727 --> 41:39.226
President Palmer will be joining us later.

41:39.314 --> 41:41.887
I'm not sure I understand you.

41:41.983 --> 41:45.269
The first part of this meeting
will be a closed session.

41:45.362 --> 41:46.914
Closed to the president?

41:47.114 --> 41:50.154
I'm afraid that's the
point of the meeting.

41:55.372 --> 41:58.289
To some of you this will come as a surprise.

41:58.750 --> 42:03.079
For most of you, though,
I hope it comes as a relief.

42:03.171 --> 42:08.925
But it is my sincere belief that,
based on his response to today's events,

42:09.010 --> 42:14.846
David Palmer is unfit to continue
as president of the United States.
