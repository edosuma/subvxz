02:19.400 --> 02:21.240
Ben?!
What are you going to do now?

02:22.840 --> 02:25.800
Water, fire, earth, air.
Water, fire, earth and air.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.440
Elements we all share.

02:27.440 --> 02:30.200
Two minutes, five seconds.
Best time yet.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.880
Puts you way ahead in first place.

02:31.880 --> 02:33.920
What? That can't be right.

02:33.920 --> 02:37.120
I did way better
in the hideout challenge.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.000
Yeah, and Nicco aced
the cave ambush.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.600
'Cause I'm stealthy
like a ninja.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.000
You were amazing.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.080
Nicco's ahead of Heath,
but Luke is killing everybody.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.560
Well, not actually killing killing.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.240
Totally slaying it.

02:49.240 --> 02:52.960
See, I don't think this
digital Book of Shadows...

02:52.960 --> 02:54.440
The boss.

02:56.280 --> 02:58.240
Yeah, that, is appreciating
my awesomeness.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.560
We should do one more.
Work on attack protocols.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.800
Once school's back, there'll be
a lot less time for training.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.160
Wow, you two.
Way to drain the fun out of magic.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.480
Hey, Ben's right.

03:06.480 --> 03:07.720
We need to train.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.560
Since when does Bad Ben
get the final say?

03:09.560 --> 03:13.200
Can we not do the Good Ben,
Bad Ben thing? He's just Ben.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.280
Luke, it's fine.

03:14.280 --> 03:16.400
No, he's changed, OK?

03:16.400 --> 03:18.120
Bye.
See ya, Luke.

03:18.120 --> 03:20.360
Come on, it'll be fun.
Bye.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.760
Sure it will.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.880
Yeah, thanks for sticking up for me.

03:23.880 --> 03:25.760
When did they get so serious?

03:25.760 --> 03:27.840
You just don't get it.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
These are heavy.
Where'd you get em?

03:32.040 --> 03:33.560
You know, two minutes five is fast,

03:33.560 --> 03:35.080
but I actually think
you can go faster.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.680
You know, I think it's the
dreadlocks weighing you down.

03:49.080 --> 03:51.400
That jump - wow!
That was awesome.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.280
No way you could do that last year.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.320
Everyone's really got a handle
on their powers now.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.240
Yeah, well, not all of us.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.560
When you get your powers...
If I get my powers.

03:59.560 --> 04:01.160
When.

04:01.160 --> 04:05.440
Look, there has to be a reason
for us to be the ones with magic.

04:05.440 --> 04:06.960
With powers.

04:06.960 --> 04:10.120
Everything we can do,
it can't be an accident.

04:10.120 --> 04:13.200
We have to be ready
for whatever's coming.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.519
You think I've lost the plot?

04:16.519 --> 04:18.120
No, no.

04:18.120 --> 04:20.160
If there are an infinite numbers
of universes out there,

04:20.160 --> 04:22.240
it follows there's an infinite
number of threats, too.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.680
That's why Bates put you
in Year 12 physics.

04:24.680 --> 04:27.240
He was just getting me
out of his class.

04:27.240 --> 04:28.560
I asked too many questions.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.000
Do you think I'm just stuck on this

04:31.000 --> 04:32.720
because I've got nothing else
going on?

04:32.720 --> 04:34.120
Like a loser?

04:34.120 --> 04:37.600
No, no, you've got, um...

04:37.600 --> 04:39.680
No, you've got, ah...

04:39.680 --> 04:41.080
You're a terrible liar.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.480
Look, they're still your friends,

04:42.480 --> 04:44.360
even if they have a funny way
of showing it.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.400
They'll come around.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.200
Anyways, I'll see ya tomorrow.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.280
OK. See ya.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.640
Yep. OK.

04:59.720 --> 05:02.000
Come on, it's just hot.

05:11.560 --> 05:13.720
Hello!

05:13.720 --> 05:15.360
Ben, you home?

05:16.840 --> 05:19.000
I'm thinking cheese toasties
for dinner.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.520
I'm in the middle of something.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.120
Is that dirt in my good bowl?

05:24.120 --> 05:25.680
I'll clean it.

05:25.680 --> 05:28.400
Looking forward to school tomorrow?

05:28.400 --> 05:29.720
I suppose.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.600
Not like I have a choice.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.000
School isn't everything, you know.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.640
Mum...

05:37.640 --> 05:39.360
Now, listen.

05:40.800 --> 05:44.320
Just because you feel like
you don't fit in,

05:44.320 --> 05:46.800
doesn't mean there's
anything wrong with you.

05:46.800 --> 05:49.120
You'll find your place.

05:50.520 --> 05:53.600
So, toastie or no toastie?

05:53.600 --> 05:56.000
Maybe just a bite.

05:58.320 --> 06:00.960
OK. Won't be long.

06:07.320 --> 06:11.120
# As a true defender

06:11.120 --> 06:15.200
# Of the ways
that you're never no fun

06:17.520 --> 06:20.920
# I can still remember

06:20.920 --> 06:25.720
# The scope of the damage
you've done

06:25.720 --> 06:31.000
# But you're so very young

06:32.440 --> 06:34.400
♪ You live in an empire... ♪

06:34.400 --> 06:38.080
I look amazing. You've really
captured my raw charisma.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.760
You don't think it's a bit...?

06:39.760 --> 06:41.120
A bit?

06:41.120 --> 06:42.720
Is it you?

06:42.720 --> 06:44.920
Of course it's me.
Who else would it be?

06:44.920 --> 06:49.600
It's your voice,
but it's not YOUR voice.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.560
I don't know what this track's
trying to say.

06:51.560 --> 06:55.120
Does it need to say anything?
Can't it just be awesome?

06:55.120 --> 06:57.080
All art says something.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.680
About us, about who we are.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.200
It's important to...

07:01.200 --> 07:04.320
All this needs to say is that
we've got mad skills.

07:04.320 --> 07:05.720
So, ready to share it with the world?

07:05.720 --> 07:07.440
Well...
Too late!

07:07.440 --> 07:10.320
And we're live.

07:10.320 --> 07:11.920
So, new tutor?

07:11.920 --> 07:14.640
Yeah, some old bat
telling me how dumb I am.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.400
I'd rather eat sand.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.400
You're dyslexic, you're not dumb.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.360
You're just diseased.

07:21.360 --> 07:24.560
So close to a compliment.
Ooh, yet so far.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.400
You seem cooler with it, though.

07:26.400 --> 07:30.000
I'll be even cooler when Bates
dumps me back in Year 10.

07:31.520 --> 07:34.640
At least you'll be bigger
than the other kids.

07:34.640 --> 07:36.560
Oh, Heath Buckland?

07:36.560 --> 07:39.640
Yeah, that's me. I'm...I'm Heath.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.520
Zara Bello. Your tutor?

07:42.520 --> 07:45.760
Your Mum did tell you about me,
right?

07:45.760 --> 07:48.240
You're Mrs Bello?

07:48.240 --> 07:50.800
Oh, no, definitely not a Mrs.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.480
I mean, who gets married in Year 12?

08:04.040 --> 08:05.920
What'd the ball ever do to you?

08:05.920 --> 08:07.800
Well, it won't do it again.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.320
You're making the face again.
It's not a face.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.640
It's a face.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.520
It's the one I used to think
was your "I hate you" face.

08:14.520 --> 08:17.360
Where you have a vein that pops
out of your forehead.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.160
It's just my serious face.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.560
Well, I haven't seen it all summer.
What gives?

08:22.960 --> 08:24.600
I don't know.

08:24.600 --> 08:28.120
Why can't things just stay fun?

08:30.920 --> 08:32.840
This IS fun.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.760
Yeah, but what about when school
starts?

08:35.760 --> 08:38.320
Ugh, had to bring THAT up.

08:38.320 --> 08:40.760
Thought you didn't want to be seen
with a freak like me.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.600
I don't.

08:42.600 --> 08:45.840
I see you at school,
I'm walking the other way.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.120
Come on.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.600
Sounds fair.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.200
First to ten goals gets to choose
which pizza.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.960
Oh, we are NOT having
ham and pineapple.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.800
It's just not right.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.440
Right. I'm off to bed.
Goodnight, Mum.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.120
Goodnight, darling.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.880
It was like I was staring into
another dimension

10:18.880 --> 10:21.280
and I was just sucked in.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.320
It could have just been a bad dream.

10:23.320 --> 10:25.360
Maybe I should've left
the window open.

10:25.360 --> 10:27.040
Or maybe this is your power.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.160
If it is, it's terrifying.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.440
It's better to know
what we might be facing.

10:31.440 --> 10:34.280
This is exactly why the others
need to take this more seriously.

10:34.280 --> 10:35.840
They already don't trust me.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.520
Maybe we should wait until I'm sure,
OK?

10:38.520 --> 10:40.400
Good morning.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.680
Hey. Yep.

10:42.680 --> 10:44.560
Beautiful morning for it.
Welcome back.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.400
Welcommen!
Excited about the start of term?

10:47.400 --> 10:50.440
Ah, well, the sun is shining,
there's young minds to inspire.

10:50.440 --> 10:53.280
What's not to love?
Everything you just described.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.600
Ah, that's enough youthful
exuberance from you, thanks.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.120
Bonjour.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.560
Guten morgen.

10:59.560 --> 11:01.880
Good to see you.
Good to see YOU!

11:01.880 --> 11:04.320
Hey, your film clip.
It's so good.

11:04.320 --> 11:05.960
Thanks. Tell your friends.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.480
Every like counts, see?

11:07.480 --> 11:10.360
Yeah, because the general public's
never wrong about music trends.

11:10.360 --> 11:12.120
Am I detecting a little
buzzkill in the air?

11:12.120 --> 11:14.960
Hey, you've gone full Kardashian.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.440
Only with talent.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.080
This is how recording contracts
happen, right?

11:18.080 --> 11:19.480
You get a following,
create the buzz....

11:19.480 --> 11:23.400
Yeah, yeah, but...you're actually
a good songwriter.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.480
Thanks, Heath.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.080
Dude, you coming or what?

11:27.080 --> 11:29.440
Your Neanderthal is calling.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.600
Nobody's talking to you,
No Direction.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.680
Later, Jesse.

11:35.680 --> 11:37.440
Since when were you into boy bands?

11:40.920 --> 11:43.200
This semester,
we'll be focusing on...

11:43.200 --> 11:46.040
Look, how long have you been waiting
for your power, and now here it is?

11:46.040 --> 11:47.560
That's all I'm saying.

11:47.560 --> 11:49.920
Yeah, I heard you.
Luke.

11:49.920 --> 11:52.720
Something you'd like to share?

11:52.720 --> 11:55.240
No, Ms Jarra.

11:55.240 --> 11:59.000
Perhaps you'd like to take another
seat, away from any distractions.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.040
Ooh.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.400
Made Mummy angry.

12:02.400 --> 12:06.320
This semester, we'll be looking at
Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.200
As well as reading the book,

12:08.200 --> 12:10.920
we'll be looking at the
graphic novel, film.

12:10.920 --> 12:13.240
We're going to start with themes.

12:13.240 --> 12:16.160
You'll notice the novel
has a subtitle.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.840
Frankenstein: A Modern Prometheus.

12:26.480 --> 12:30.920
Who can tell me who Prometheus was?

12:35.440 --> 12:37.320
Yes, Nicco?

12:37.320 --> 12:40.360
In Greek mythology,
Prometheus was a Titan.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.840
Hey. Hey!

12:44.840 --> 12:47.240
The talisman...
I'll take that.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.480
What are the rules
about games in class?

12:51.480 --> 12:53.920
It's not a game. Look, I need that.

12:53.920 --> 12:57.440
The phrase you're looking for is,
"Sorry, Ms Jarra."

13:00.040 --> 13:02.240
Look, Mum, please don't do this...

13:02.240 --> 13:05.200
You can collect it after school.

13:06.440 --> 13:07.680
What was I saying?

13:07.680 --> 13:10.720
Ah, yes, Frankenstein.

13:10.720 --> 13:15.040
As well as reading the graphic
novel, films, analytical essays...

13:17.480 --> 13:19.520
We're going to start
by looking at the...

13:19.520 --> 13:21.080
You let your Mum
take the talisman?

13:21.080 --> 13:23.760
You don't LET my Mum do things,
she just does them.

13:23.760 --> 13:24.880
What were you doing with it?

13:24.880 --> 13:26.360
It lit up.

13:26.360 --> 13:28.320
It hasn't done that in months.

13:28.320 --> 13:31.120
Because there hasn't been a threat.
But if Ben's dream is real...

13:31.120 --> 13:32.520
What dream's this?

13:32.520 --> 13:35.080
Ben had a premonition.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.680
It could be his power.

13:37.680 --> 13:39.440
Tell them.

13:39.440 --> 13:41.400
Well, it's hard to say.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.080
But I think it was some
kind of attack.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.200
They certainly felt hostile.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.320
They?! Who were they?

13:48.320 --> 13:50.040
I have to get to class.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.440
Let's meet up at lunch in the Lair.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.160
I've got tutoring.
Oh, lunch isn't great.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.640
Look, this is serious.

13:54.640 --> 13:56.520
We need to sort this out.

13:59.600 --> 14:02.480
337 hits.

14:02.480 --> 14:04.200
OK.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.040
If it makes you feel any better,

14:07.040 --> 14:08.760
the second track can be less
mainstream.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.240
This isn't about mainstream.

14:11.240 --> 14:14.280
No, it's...it's about maturity.

14:14.280 --> 14:15.600
Only you're not.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.360
It's dishonest. Just be you.

14:18.360 --> 14:19.920
I am being me.

14:19.920 --> 14:23.160
Jess, they weren't even
your clothes.

14:23.160 --> 14:24.720
Come on, back to work.

14:24.720 --> 14:27.840
Well, let's get me famous first,
then I can be me.

14:27.840 --> 14:30.000
Yeah, whoever that is.

14:45.320 --> 14:49.040
Whenever I try to read,
it's like the wiring in my head.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.920
The words on the page,
they all just...

14:50.920 --> 14:53.240
Jumble together?
Yeah.

14:53.240 --> 14:54.720
Yeah. How'd you know?

14:54.720 --> 14:58.560
Best person to tutor a dyslexic
is another dyslexic.

14:59.880 --> 15:02.200
Hang on, aren't you like
an ultra-brainiac?

15:02.200 --> 15:04.840
Yeah, I'm smart. I have to be.

15:04.840 --> 15:06.520
It's harder for people like us.

15:06.520 --> 15:09.000
Yeah. Which isn't exactly fair.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.760
Yeah, well, welcome to real life.

15:10.760 --> 15:15.560
So, you going to tell me
how a dyslexic got top marks?

15:15.560 --> 15:17.040
Depends.

15:17.040 --> 15:19.040
What's in it for me?

15:22.160 --> 15:23.920
My Mum's specialty.

15:25.520 --> 15:29.280
Tuna...and aioli.

15:29.280 --> 15:31.240
Whatever aioli is.

15:31.240 --> 15:34.640
I'm a vegetarian,
and you're an idiot.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.440
Your loss.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.720
I know you're all wondering
why we're here.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.360
So let me put you
out of your misery.

15:43.360 --> 15:49.280
You have the opportunity to try out
for the state team.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.280
This is so cool.

15:51.280 --> 15:55.480
If you hear your name,
you'll be training tomorrow.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.320
Olivia.

15:57.320 --> 15:58.880
Yin.

15:58.880 --> 16:00.040
Bruna.
Nice.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.440
Peta.
Ahh.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.600
Niccolina.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.200
Elizabeth.

16:06.200 --> 16:09.880
You'll need a consent form
signed by a parent.

16:09.880 --> 16:12.920
No form, no tryout.

16:12.920 --> 16:14.840
There we go.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.480
Wow, we could make state.
Incredible.

16:16.480 --> 16:18.160
Yeah, if we're good enough.

16:18.160 --> 16:19.840
Are you kidding? Of course we are.

16:19.840 --> 16:22.200
We should hit the extra training
sessions hard, yeah?

16:22.200 --> 16:23.840
Start right away.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.320
See if we improve in time. Yeah?

16:25.320 --> 16:27.720
Hello?

16:27.720 --> 16:29.840
No? Where are you going?

16:36.640 --> 16:38.760
Sorry.
Where were you?

16:38.760 --> 16:40.760
Sports stuff.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.640
We didn't get a chance to talk
about Ben's premonition.

16:42.640 --> 16:44.400
If it was a premonition.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.040
Ben had a bad dream. So what?

16:46.040 --> 16:50.040
Didn't the other Ben have visions
whenever he touched something?

16:50.040 --> 16:52.240
Yeah, let's test that out.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.480
Come on.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.720
Let's see if your eyes
turn baby blue.

16:55.720 --> 16:57.960
Look, I don't want to cause trouble.
Don't be shy.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.480
Leave him alone. Here's what we do.

17:00.480 --> 17:03.600
I get the talisman back and then we
prepare for whatever this thing is.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.640
No. You prepare.

17:05.640 --> 17:08.400
If that thing shows up,
give us a call.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.520
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

17:10.520 --> 17:11.960
Heath.

17:11.960 --> 17:14.720
Yeah, yeah, we heard you.
Ben has powers.

17:14.720 --> 17:16.640
Whoop-de-do! The sky is falling.

17:16.640 --> 17:18.079
Heath, wait up.
Danger's coming.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.520
Two moons are rising.

17:19.520 --> 17:21.119
Look, just stop!

17:24.119 --> 17:26.200
You did not just do that.

17:26.200 --> 17:29.200
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
Hey. What's going on?

17:29.200 --> 17:30.600
Nothing, Ms Jarra.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.280
Then you should be
on your way to class.

17:37.320 --> 17:39.120
Luke, what was that about?

17:39.120 --> 17:41.040
Mum, please.
I beg your pardon?

17:41.040 --> 17:42.640
Just leave it, OK?

17:42.640 --> 17:45.200
Luke! Luke!

17:45.200 --> 17:47.440
Luke!

17:47.440 --> 17:50.160
I'm kind of busy here.

17:50.160 --> 17:52.400
Luke.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.360
Oh, come on. Don't make me come in.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.120
Luke.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.560
Hey, Miss.
Luke!

17:58.560 --> 18:00.800
Ah, think you've got
the wrong bathroom.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.080
Inappropriate.

18:04.920 --> 18:07.680
Luke, open this door right now.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.640
Someone in here?

18:09.640 --> 18:11.280
Luke.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.600
I'm not joking, Luke.

18:15.600 --> 18:18.600
Can you just come out? This...

18:30.720 --> 18:32.360
I'm coming in.

18:40.440 --> 18:41.800
No way.

18:41.800 --> 18:44.160
Luke, that's enough.

18:57.080 --> 18:58.360
I'm coming in.

18:58.360 --> 18:59.960
No! Don't!

19:04.360 --> 19:06.160
What's going on in there?

19:06.160 --> 19:09.440
What on earth?

19:09.440 --> 19:11.440
Disappointing, Luke.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.240
Really disappointing.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.440
Look, I told you.

19:20.440 --> 19:23.360
Something ambushed me.
It trashed the place.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.920
What, like a personal hygiene demon?

19:25.920 --> 19:27.720
Whooo.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.760
Yeah, thanks, Luke. Thanks heaps.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.200
What did you see
in your premonition?

19:33.200 --> 19:35.240
It was black and snake-like.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.320
Exactly! And kinda mean?
Yeah.

19:37.320 --> 19:39.360
OK, so Luke was right.
Well, yeah.

19:39.360 --> 19:40.800
I hate it when he's right.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.800
Why didn't you say so?

19:43.800 --> 19:46.240
Joke. Look, let's keep our
sense of humour, people.

19:46.240 --> 19:48.320
OK, well, what are you waiting for?

19:48.320 --> 19:49.880
You go get the talisman.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.240
We need to find this thing.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.280
Any sign of it?

20:07.800 --> 20:09.720
Not yet.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.960
If it came this way,
we need to be ready.

20:24.080 --> 20:25.720
Wait, do you hear that?
Shh!

20:32.480 --> 20:34.200
What is that?

20:34.200 --> 20:36.000
That is...

20:36.000 --> 20:37.800
Whatever it is, I'm out of here.

20:38.880 --> 20:40.640
Run.

20:57.960 --> 20:59.600
You made it angry.

20:59.600 --> 21:00.680
She confiscated it.

21:00.680 --> 21:02.200
She said I could have it
after school.

21:02.200 --> 21:04.680
Ms Jarra's in a meeting.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.040
It's kind of important.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.920
I'll call her.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.400
Let me try.

21:21.760 --> 21:23.240
We need to get it away from here.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.320
Where is that talisman?

21:24.320 --> 21:26.040
Hello?

21:26.040 --> 21:28.480
Yes, it's Brianna
from out the front.

21:28.480 --> 21:31.960
Hey, listen, did you get those links
that I sent you for that festival?

21:31.960 --> 21:34.160
Has the meeting started?

21:34.160 --> 21:36.800
OK, yeah. Yeah, I know. I know.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.600
What's it doing now?

21:42.600 --> 21:45.440
You know,
that's what he said to me as well.

21:45.440 --> 21:48.120
OK, yeah. Yeah, I know.

21:48.120 --> 21:51.440
I know. I know.

21:51.440 --> 21:55.160
Anyway, ah, Ms Jarra's son's
out here and, I don't know,

21:55.160 --> 21:57.800
he wants to see her about something.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.600
Let's do this.

22:01.600 --> 22:05.960
Come on, whatever you are.

22:05.960 --> 22:07.400
Protection spell.

22:07.400 --> 22:08.920
We might be seen.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.400
Let's go down the drain.

22:41.320 --> 22:42.800
It's just like training, OK?

22:42.800 --> 22:44.920
I'll draw them to me.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.960
I've got this.

22:55.320 --> 22:56.760
Here!

22:59.520 --> 23:01.560
Over here!

23:05.400 --> 23:06.640
Anyone got a Plan B?

23:06.640 --> 23:08.080
Luke!
Luke!

23:08.080 --> 23:10.120
Bit of help here.

23:10.120 --> 23:12.240
What is that?

23:13.920 --> 23:15.000
It can't be.

23:15.960 --> 23:17.440
They're multiplying.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.520
Protection spell, now!

23:22.520 --> 23:24.800
Divinity of the elements,
I summon thee.

23:24.800 --> 23:27.240
Air, fire, water and earth.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.520
Aid in my quest I call you forth...

23:29.520 --> 23:30.840
It's not working!

23:30.840 --> 23:32.520
Come on!
Again.

23:32.520 --> 23:35.720
Divinity of the elements,
I summon thee.

23:35.720 --> 23:37.680
Air, fire, water and earth.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.920
Aid in my quest I call you forth.

23:49.760 --> 23:52.800
Just another sleepy Monday
in Bremin, then.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.800
What is this thing?
Details, now.

24:12.800 --> 24:14.400
It's a paranormal nematode.

24:14.400 --> 24:15.760
What if we stop them
with a binding spell

24:15.760 --> 24:18.720
and then use a banish spell
to send them out of the world?

24:18.720 --> 24:20.120
Could work.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.440
Oh, no.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.480
What is this place?
