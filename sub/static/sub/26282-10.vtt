WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:02.570
Scrub in with The Resident.

00:02.603 --> 00:04.638
This is a business.
It's not a charity.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.574
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:06.607 --> 00:08.542
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.576 --> 00:11.912
9-1-1, Lethal Weapon,
and Empire.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.248
We lost Empire,
but we are still here.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.820
-Previously on The Resident...

00:19.853 --> 00:21.355
I need half a million dollars
to make bail

00:21.389 --> 00:22.690
so I can get
out of this rathole.

00:22.723 --> 00:23.691
DEVON:
Recently I've been attracted

00:23.724 --> 00:24.692
to somebody else.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.194
-I can't marry you.
-Get out.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.728
I never want to see you again.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.098
What about an outpatient clinic
for the uninsured?

00:30.131 --> 00:32.233
We will have to hire
a top primary care physician.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.402
-We need a diagnosis.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.437
-I have Crohn's.
-GORDON: At QuoVadis,

00:36.470 --> 00:38.572
we manufacture everything
ourselves in Atlanta.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.074
Your lab is a sham.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.609
Do you know
what I hate the most?

00:42.943 --> 00:44.044
Betrayal.

00:46.414 --> 00:48.782
SIMMONS: He needs emergency
surgery. Find Conrad now.

00:48.816 --> 00:49.917
BELL:
He's bleeding out.

01:08.469 --> 01:11.472
BELL: Compress the vein
above and below.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.207
RESIDENT: I can't see it.
There's too much blood.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.408
CHU: Activate massive
transfusion protocol.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.076
BELL:
Get the Cell Saver.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.511
Give him one gram of TXA now.

01:20.348 --> 01:22.983
-CHU: He's about to code.

01:29.022 --> 01:30.924
BELL: Get me more suction.
Keep slamming blood into him.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.025
Clamp.

01:37.365 --> 01:40.100
-MAN: Killer! Murderer!

01:40.134 --> 01:42.170
REPORTER: I'm outside
the Atlanta Detention Center

01:42.203 --> 01:45.239
where Dr. Lane Hunter is
expected to be released on bail.

01:45.273 --> 01:47.675
Hunter is charged with giving
hundreds of patients

01:47.708 --> 01:50.311
unnecessary chemotherapy
for profit.

01:50.344 --> 01:53.581
With trial just weeks away,
her release comes as a shock.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.648
CROWD :
No bail for killers!

01:54.682 --> 01:56.950
No bail
for killers!

01:56.984 --> 01:58.952
No bail for killers!

01:58.986 --> 02:00.988
No bail
for killers!

02:01.021 --> 02:02.656
No bail for killers!

02:02.690 --> 02:04.892
Move back.
Back up.

02:07.295 --> 02:09.597
No bail for killers!

02:09.630 --> 02:11.665
No bail
for killers!

02:11.699 --> 02:12.933
No bail for killers!

02:12.966 --> 02:15.669
No bail
for killers!

02:15.703 --> 02:18.706
No bail for killers!

02:18.739 --> 02:20.274
You bitch!

02:20.308 --> 02:21.342
Bitch!

02:21.375 --> 02:22.810
You let her out just like that?!

02:22.843 --> 02:24.178
No bail
for killers!

02:24.212 --> 02:25.713
-No bail for killers!

02:25.746 --> 02:26.714
No...

02:26.747 --> 02:29.317
*

02:45.866 --> 02:48.369
BELL: During the resection,
all the planes of dissection

02:48.402 --> 02:52.406
were obliterated and his bowel
was adhered to the IVC.

02:52.440 --> 02:55.876
Eight hours, 20 units of blood
and blood products.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.511
I did manage

02:57.545 --> 03:00.248
to repair the injury
using a saphenous vein graft.

03:00.281 --> 03:03.050
Well, what's his prognosis?

03:03.083 --> 03:06.186
That's too soon to tell,
but he's alive.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.088
BOARD MEMBER:
Thank God you were on call.

03:08.121 --> 03:09.590
I hate to think what might have
happened to Marshall Winthrop

03:09.623 --> 03:13.927
in the hands
of a less gifted surgeon.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.829
CONRAD:
I should've been there with him.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.231
There's nothing more
you could have done.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.566
They got him
into surgery right away.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.668
I left him all alone with Bell.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.203
Mina was there to help,
and according to her,

03:23.237 --> 03:24.872
Bell did everything right.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.407
We haven't had enough time
to sort out our issues.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.908
And now,
just when I was starting

03:27.941 --> 03:29.577
to get to know my father,
I could lose him.

03:29.610 --> 03:32.613
Hey. Don't go there.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.448
I'm sure he'll wake up soon.

03:34.482 --> 03:36.417
But in what condition?

03:36.450 --> 03:40.888
He could have neuro deficits
from being under so long.

03:40.921 --> 03:44.392
20 units of blood, FFP,
and platelets transfused?

03:44.425 --> 03:48.596
That alone carries
a 25% chance of mortality.

03:48.629 --> 03:51.031
If someone hadn't run
that surgical checklist

03:51.064 --> 03:54.067
-and had blood on hand...
-They did.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.904
And your father is strong.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.439
All we can do now is wait.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.210
It's gonna be okay.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.546
WOMAN:
They let her out?

04:10.117 --> 04:11.619
Hey, what's going on?

04:11.652 --> 04:13.954
Lane Hunter. She's out on bail.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.558
-CONRAD: That's impossible.

04:17.591 --> 04:18.559
Bail was five million.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.461
MINA:
That's probably nothing to her.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.330
I heard she billed Medicare
over $20 million a year

04:22.363 --> 04:23.564
for unnecessary chemo.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.566
But her accounts were frozen.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.468
She found the money somewhere.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.570
MINA: That won't change
the outcome. She's a murderer.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.771
The jury will convict her.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.345
We have interviews at the clinic

04:37.378 --> 04:39.980
for our new primary care doc.

04:40.013 --> 04:41.982
-Yeah.
-Good, I'll meet you there.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.217
I have to check in
with Dr. Austin.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.656
I can't believe this.

04:48.689 --> 04:51.825
We have to let
the legal system do its job.

04:58.999 --> 05:02.936
I'm thinking two zolpidem
and a half a quart of whiskey.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.473
MINA: He left a fine woman
at the altar last night

05:05.506 --> 05:07.207
in front of both their families.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.976
I have no sympathy.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.345
-Go home!

05:11.379 --> 05:13.447
-Ooh.
-DEVON: I can't.

05:13.481 --> 05:17.150
Priya's there. She doesn't leave
for San Francisco until Friday.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.553
Wow, no wife and no home.

05:19.587 --> 05:21.789
I at least feel pity for you.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.657
He was sniffing around Julian.
The device rep?

05:23.691 --> 05:26.860
An engaged man out there,
on the prowl.

05:29.196 --> 05:31.832
I thought better of you.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.571
You're a little too hard on him.

05:37.605 --> 05:40.007
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.410
Sometimes the head
has no control.

05:42.443 --> 05:43.844
We all have a moral compass,

05:43.877 --> 05:45.879
and we have a choice
to follow it or not.

05:45.913 --> 05:48.148
He had feelings for Julian?
He should have avoided her.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.550
Instead, he kept spending time
with her.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.351
What did he think would happen?

05:51.385 --> 05:54.688
Anyway, when I'm done
with the clinic, I'll find you.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.323
What do we have on deck?

05:56.356 --> 05:58.992
Uh, just a VATS case.

05:59.026 --> 06:02.396
You'll be bored.
Go join Dr. Voss.

06:08.636 --> 06:09.903
BAI:
Here are files

06:09.937 --> 06:11.104
on the candidates.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.607
Are you going to be volunteering
on a regular basis?

06:13.641 --> 06:16.276
Bai was our first med student
to sign up.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.011
Who do we have first?

06:18.045 --> 06:20.414
Um, Dr. Christina Ruiz.

06:20.448 --> 06:23.417
Graduated from Johns Hopkins
in family medicine.

06:23.451 --> 06:25.285
Huh, sounds promising.

06:25.318 --> 06:26.854
Let's get started.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.121
RUIZ: Your clinic would be
the perfect fit

06:28.155 --> 06:29.389
for me.

06:29.423 --> 06:30.924
I spent last year in Haiti
with Partners in Health.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.926
I grew up in Atlanta
and want to give back.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.695
Serve the underserved.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.564
Access. Too many hospitals
treat and street.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.566
There's no continuity.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.601
Do you have any questions
for us?

06:40.634 --> 06:43.403
Yes. The salary posted,
was that monthly?

06:43.437 --> 06:44.938
I'm kind of between jobs.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.373
What if you pay
my malpractice insurance?

06:46.406 --> 06:47.741
I've got a fair number

06:47.775 --> 06:49.610
of totally frivolous lawsuits.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.144
I'm sorry, but with the amount

06:51.178 --> 06:53.046
of med school debt I'm carrying,

06:53.080 --> 06:54.982
you don't need a physician,
you need a saint.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.884
Is that really everyone?

06:56.917 --> 06:58.919
Okay, uh,
I wasn't gonna mention it,

06:58.952 --> 07:00.954
because it's a super long shot,

07:00.988 --> 07:05.092
but if "saint" is the criteria,
I do know of a guy.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.664
Oh, there he is.

07:10.698 --> 07:12.800
Dr. Alec Shaw.

07:12.833 --> 07:16.604
First he was
an infectious disease doc,

07:16.637 --> 07:20.007
then he volunteered on a Navajo
reservation doing outreach.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.576
After that he got
into family medicine.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.978
I first saw him
in my hometown, New Orleans.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.580
Why didn't
you mention him before?

07:26.614 --> 07:28.516
BAI:
He just landed in Atlanta.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.083
He's always on the move.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.285
And he hates hospitals.

07:32.319 --> 07:34.421
Hates institutionalized
medicine.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.123
Oh. I like him already.

07:36.156 --> 07:39.359
NIC: So he has no fixed
practice

07:39.392 --> 07:42.763
He has kind of an office.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.465
NIC:
Well, let's go talk to him.

07:45.499 --> 07:48.468
Um, you'll have to wait
your turn.

07:48.502 --> 07:51.471
He never lets anyone
jump the line.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.373
Hmm. My shift starts
in 20 minutes.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.475
Oh, you guys go. I-I got this.

07:55.509 --> 07:56.677
-Yeah.

07:56.710 --> 07:57.945
All right, good luck.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.255
-Thank you, Doctor.
-You bet.

08:09.657 --> 08:10.791
CHARLIE:
Belly bomb?

08:10.824 --> 08:12.960
Solid cream center
with a fine dusting

08:12.993 --> 08:17.064
of powdered sugar on top,
courtesy of QuoVadis.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.966
You're now the device rep?
Where's Julian?

08:18.999 --> 08:20.834
Who

08:20.868 --> 08:22.836
Hold on.

08:24.572 --> 08:26.740
I bet you're more
of a glazed man.

08:26.774 --> 08:29.910
H No?

08:29.943 --> 08:31.979
That guy is
Julian's replacement.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.747
CONRAD:
Where is she?

08:33.781 --> 08:35.182
I don't know.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.817
She said she was gonna quit
and leave town,

08:36.850 --> 08:38.351
and now she's ghosting me.

08:38.385 --> 08:39.987
That's harsh.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.089
Look, about yesterday,

08:42.122 --> 08:44.692
I'm sorry, man.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.194
How's your dad?

08:47.227 --> 08:49.329
Not clear yet.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.431
You should go home.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.734
I don't have one at the moment.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.068
And I'd rather work.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.037
I hear that.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.408
There's an arm lac in ER Three.

09:01.441 --> 09:03.877
I think you might want
to take this one.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.381
-Okay.
-NATALIE:
Look, what do you want me to do?

09:08.415 --> 09:09.850
They're gonna stitch me up
and then we'll leave.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.885
I... you know,
I didn't mean to fall, I fell.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.353
We should have just
watched it on TV.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.555
No way. You, of all people,
had to be there.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.224
I'm Dr. Hawkins.
What's going on?

09:17.257 --> 09:20.093
We were at a protest,
it got crazy.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.562
-Yeah.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.765
And neither one of us
are happy that we ended up here.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.734
Lane Hunter killed
Roger's sister.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.235
She came in
with stage I breast cancer.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.938
Lane treated it
like it was stage IV.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.774
All Judy probably needed
was a lumpectomy.

09:33.807 --> 09:37.377
Instead, she died from a
reaction to Dr. Hunter's chemo.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.647
I am so sorry.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.249
I am not exactly a fan
of Dr. Hunter either.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.553
Let's have a look at that arm.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.421
-ROGER:
She had a pretty bad fall.
-Uh, it was a big crowd.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.057
I tripped. Just stitch me up
and send me home.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.092
ROGER:
Natalie used to be a cop.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.762
-Nothing fazes her.
-Well, I'm seeing
some bruising here.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.997
I'm gonna order an X-ray just to
make sure there's no fracture.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.331
Hey, you're not hearing me.

09:58.365 --> 10:01.434
I'm fine. Stitch me and I'm out.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.770
And she doesn't like doctors.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.572
I get it.
I know what Dr. Hunter did.

10:05.605 --> 10:09.609
Dr. Hunter gave Natalie chemo
and she didn't even have cancer.

10:09.643 --> 10:12.145
She's the reason
I'm no longer a cop.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.016
Soon as I get an answer,
I'll let you know.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.017
GRAYSON:
Doc-Doctor Bell.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.493
Yeah?

10:26.526 --> 10:28.028
My hero.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.997
Dr. Bell, you have a call...

10:31.364 --> 10:33.366
I bailed you out,

10:33.400 --> 10:35.769
I got you a great legal team.
Now it's time to hand over

10:35.803 --> 10:37.337
the deposition and the tape.

10:37.370 --> 10:40.373
I'm checking into
a very nice hotel. Come by.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.109
Alone, of course.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.643
And let's discuss.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.312
I'll send my lawyer.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.147
Excuse me.
Turn around here,

10:47.180 --> 10:48.716
go to Chastain Park.

10:48.749 --> 10:51.018
I'm on my way to you.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.755
What hotel?

10:59.192 --> 11:01.294
Roger and I became friends
at Dr. Hunter's clinic.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.330
Poor guy drove his sister to
every one of her appointments.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.998
That's a good brother.

11:05.032 --> 11:07.735
Yeah, that's what I tell him,
but he still blames himself.

11:07.768 --> 11:10.503
What diagnosis were you given
for the weakness in your legs?

11:10.537 --> 11:12.405
Neuropathy from the chemo.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.708
It just won't get better.
Yeah, today it's even worse.

11:14.742 --> 11:17.144
Protest must have
really wore me out.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.146
Well, let's make sure
it's nothing more.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.914
-We have one of the best
-No.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.216
orthopedic spinal surgeons
in the country, Dr. Voss.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.185
I want her to check you out.

11:25.218 --> 11:28.188
Look, I was a legacy officer
in the Atlanta PD.

11:28.221 --> 11:31.224
My mom before me,
Grandpa before that.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.927
I wish I could have it all back,
but I can't.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.896
Accepting that was
the hardest thing I've done,

11:35.929 --> 11:37.731
but I did it.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.372
This isn't the discharge desk.

11:46.606 --> 11:49.242
I had a patient here.

11:49.276 --> 11:53.781
She came in after having
a reaction to chemo from Lane.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.116
Shock again, at 360!

11:56.149 --> 11:57.384
The night she coded,

11:57.417 --> 11:59.887
we all fought to save her.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.569
I can't bring Lily back,

12:16.603 --> 12:19.206
but if there is any possible way

12:19.239 --> 12:22.275
to fix your legs,
I want to find it.

12:26.914 --> 12:31.051
Give me and Dr. Voss one hour.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.220
One hour.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.898
-How long has that
been going off?
-It just started.

12:44.932 --> 12:47.634
The RT's in a code down the
hall. Should I call for backup?

12:47.667 --> 12:50.003
No, hold on,
his respiratory rate's too high.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.604
Mr. Winthrop's peak pressure
is climbing.

12:51.638 --> 12:54.207
He needs more sedation.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.979
No, it's the vent settings.

12:59.012 --> 13:01.114
It's trapping air in his lungs.
We need to get him off of it.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.549
But he hasn't had
a spontaneous breathing trial.

13:05.718 --> 13:07.020
-I'm getting an attending.

13:07.054 --> 13:08.255
The vent's too high.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.756
It was stacking his breaths.

13:09.789 --> 13:13.626
He's awake, we can extubate.

13:25.839 --> 13:28.575
CONRAD :
It's okay. I got you.

13:30.543 --> 13:32.812
BELL: So you blackmail me
with a sex tape,

13:32.846 --> 13:34.447
tell me to come alone,

13:34.481 --> 13:35.983
and now you bring a lawyer?

13:36.016 --> 13:37.650
Ugh, calm down.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.786
Now, Martin handled
the wire transfer.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.188
You are paid back, my friend.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.956
BLACKMAR: The funds were
transferred from a shell company

13:42.990 --> 13:45.158
-in the Bahamas to an account
in your lawyer's name,

13:45.192 --> 13:47.460
so there's no evidence
of a financial relationship

13:47.494 --> 13:49.062
between you and Dr. Hunter.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.632
Great.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.668
-Now the deposition
and the sex tape.
-Okay,

13:55.702 --> 13:58.371
-Not feeling too relaxed.

13:58.405 --> 13:59.839
LANE:
Well, then, try.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.841
I plan to.

14:01.875 --> 14:04.244
Probably somewhere
with palm trees and dark rum

14:04.277 --> 14:06.813
and pool boys
with very little clothing.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.648
Oh.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.251
But first
we have to get past this trial.

14:11.284 --> 14:14.254
Cancer treatment is complicated.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.723
The trial's outcome
will depend largely on how

14:16.756 --> 14:19.859
Dr. Hunter's chemo protocols
are perceived.

14:19.893 --> 14:23.163
The jury will rely on testimony
from medical experts.

14:23.196 --> 14:26.166
Pillars of the community,
ready to stand up for her.

14:26.199 --> 14:30.037
You want me to testify publicly

14:30.070 --> 14:32.739
about what a great doctor
you are

14:32.772 --> 14:37.610
Uh... why don't you just tell
the jury the facts, Randolph?

14:37.644 --> 14:39.913
Cancer treatment requires
experimentation.

14:39.947 --> 14:42.882
Oncologists routinely
use drugs off-label.

14:42.916 --> 14:45.885
When ones that the FDA approves
don't work,

14:45.919 --> 14:48.888
we improvise.
Why? To save lives.

14:48.922 --> 14:51.891
Find someone else.

14:51.925 --> 14:55.228
All right, can we just
have a minute alone?

14:55.262 --> 14:56.930
All right, I'll tell you what--
release the tape.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.532
I'll bounce back.
I'm not the only CEO

14:59.566 --> 15:02.302
who's had consensual sex
with an unfortunate partner.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.903
I'm done being blackmailed.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.438
You're done
when I say you're done.

15:05.472 --> 15:08.408
-You killed Lily Kendall.
-No, I didn't.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.743
Which is exactly why they have
no evidence to prove I did.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.980
You're the only one
with a motive,

15:13.013 --> 15:14.414
you were at the hospital
that night,

15:14.447 --> 15:17.917
I saw you there,
and I'll testify to it.

15:17.951 --> 15:20.120
Hmm. You know, I heard once
about an appendectomy patient

15:20.153 --> 15:22.155
that died in your OR.

15:22.189 --> 15:24.757
You know, we all make mistakes,
but something tells me

15:24.791 --> 15:28.461
you've had more than your share.

15:28.495 --> 15:31.798
Whatever secrets
you have, Randolph,

15:31.831 --> 15:33.733
I'll find them.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.168
I'll hire a medical detective,

15:35.202 --> 15:38.671
I'll depose
your entire OR staff.

15:38.705 --> 15:41.741
Well, my staff will back me up

15:41.774 --> 15:44.177
long before they'll support you.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.818
ALEC:
Good news, brother.

15:51.851 --> 15:54.954
You're not dead. Bad news?
You got maggots.

15:58.525 --> 15:59.492
Hold tight, you're up next.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.594
Oh, um, I'm not actually
a patient.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.196
I'm a nurse practitioner
from Chastain Park.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.598
I wanted to talk to you
about the community clinic

16:05.632 --> 16:07.834
-we're opening...
-I already told
your med student no.

16:07.867 --> 16:10.270
You want to switch it out
every couple hours.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.971
Hamburger's gonna draw 'em out
faster than any drug

16:12.005 --> 16:12.972
you're gonna get
at her hospital.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.974
Cheaper.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.143
Safer, too.

16:17.577 --> 16:20.213
GLADYS:
Come on, Sammy, we're next.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.982
The clinic will be free.
And with more supplies

16:23.016 --> 16:25.685
and volunteers,
you can reach more patients.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.354
And it's a lot bigger than
what you're working with here.

16:27.387 --> 16:30.223
I grew up in a converted
school bus in Tennessee.

16:30.257 --> 16:32.892
It was my dad's idea,
and not his best one.

16:32.925 --> 16:35.228
Or his worst.

16:35.262 --> 16:36.996
11 kids.
Lots of government cheese.

16:37.030 --> 16:40.700
So, to me,
this is the Taj Mahal.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.635
-GLADYS: Sammy, knock it off.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.237
-This is fun.
-You know, he's going through

16:44.271 --> 16:46.239
-this licking phase.

16:46.273 --> 16:47.874
GLADYS:
It is metal.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.542
I got something for him.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.012
Strawberry, my favorite.

16:53.046 --> 16:54.547
Good choice, little man.

16:54.581 --> 16:58.151
All right, Gladys,
let's see that finger.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.487
So, your boy's licking metal

17:00.520 --> 17:04.091
-'cause he's got
a mineral deficiency.
-Oh.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.025
A good multivitamin
is all you need.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.327
GLADYS:
Oh, okay.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.562
ALEC:
Let's see here.

17:12.965 --> 17:15.502
Hey, look at you. Sugar's down.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.570
You been hitting that South Bend
Park

17:17.604 --> 17:20.173
GLADYS: Stopping diabetes before
I get it, just like you said.

17:21.574 --> 17:24.043
SAMMY:
Thanks for the lollipop, Doctor.

17:24.077 --> 17:26.546
Look, I'd love to talk to you
for just a few minutes.

17:26.579 --> 17:27.880
Look, I don't have time
for breaks.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.349
I got a long line
out there, so...

17:29.382 --> 17:31.918
I heard you got free flu shots.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.520
Yes, we do.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.288
You ever had a reaction
to one of these?

17:35.322 --> 17:38.225
-No.
-Take a seat.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.261
I'll help you get your line down

17:41.294 --> 17:44.631
if you give me some pointers
on how to run our clinic.

17:46.333 --> 17:50.137
All right, you're gonna feel
a light pinch.

17:50.170 --> 17:53.039
You were diagnosed with
nerve damage from the chemo,

17:53.072 --> 17:55.041
but actually the chemo
caused osteopenia.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.477
You see this here?

17:57.510 --> 18:00.813
You had a tiny fracture
on your T12.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.915
That's what caused
the weakness in your legs.

18:02.949 --> 18:04.617
When you fell today,
it got worse.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.553
Now it's compressing
against the spinal cord.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.156
It's become an emergency.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.891
I knew it. I knew one test
and I'd end up in surgery.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.460
CONRAD:
No, Natalie,

18:13.493 --> 18:15.495
these two are the real deal.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.096
Listen to Dr. Voss.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.398
KIT:
It's nothing short of a miracle

18:18.431 --> 18:19.599
that we caught this.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.268
If we don't operate,

18:21.301 --> 18:23.736
you'll be paralyzed from
the waist down within hours.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.338
CONRAD: But if you get in there
right away, there's a chance

18:25.372 --> 18:27.140
they can remove
the compression altogether.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.608
You would have
your strength back.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.643
And then everything
that Lane took from you,

18:30.677 --> 18:31.878
that'd be in the rearview.

18:34.981 --> 18:36.949
Back surgery is dangerous.

18:36.983 --> 18:39.018
KIT: Are there risks? Yes.
But the alternative

18:39.051 --> 18:41.488
is you'll spend your life
in a wheelchair.

18:41.521 --> 18:45.325
I can give you a really good
shot at walking alone.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.499
:
I'm so mad at you.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.901
Is that a yes?

19:03.843 --> 19:05.445
-I don't get it.
-Thank you.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.814
I don't know why
she's not texting me back.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.650
Salespeople move on.
So should you.

19:10.683 --> 19:11.851
Julian still thinks
I got married last night.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.286
I have to tell her, or then...

19:13.320 --> 19:15.488
Julian is not
returning your texts.

19:15.522 --> 19:16.889
Get a grip, bruh.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.726
-Like...

19:19.759 --> 19:22.495
Oh, so y-you're going for the
crazy stalker approach, huh?

19:22.529 --> 19:25.498
Listen to me,
it's not a good look.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.534
Stop.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.847
ARMY GENERAL: As new
technologies emerge in medicine,

19:40.880 --> 19:43.883
as in other fields,
the U.S. military strives

19:43.916 --> 19:46.152
to be on the cutting edge
of the industry.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.020
That's why we're
at QuoVadis today.

19:48.054 --> 19:50.557
Gordon, I hear from DARPA, the
first thing they want to look at

19:50.590 --> 19:54.994
is the impact
of your VNS device on memory.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.697
You want to use it to cure PTSD?

19:57.730 --> 20:01.000
We're interested
in the possibility.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.936
This company's future
with the military is limitless.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.372
Don't you agree?

20:11.644 --> 20:15.114
-I'm a little stressed.

20:16.249 --> 20:17.717
No.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.419
No, make that scared.

20:19.452 --> 20:22.655
-But let's do this.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.091
I need an EKG now.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.797
Your heart's racing.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.632
Has this ever happened
to you before?

20:32.665 --> 20:34.734
Palpitations sometimes.
Nothing big.

20:36.135 --> 20:38.170
I've never had my spine
sliced into, so...

20:39.906 --> 20:41.941
-Natalie, breathe.

20:41.974 --> 20:45.778
Breathe. Natalie.
Get the crash cart.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.146
Pulse 160, BP's dropping.

20:47.179 --> 20:50.249
She's in unstable V tach. Defib!

20:53.320 --> 20:56.155
-All right, 200. Let's go.

20:56.188 --> 20:58.591
-Clear.
-Natalie.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.993
300. Clear.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.732
Give her 150 of amio
and transfer her to the ICU.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.400
ROGER:
What's wrong with her?

21:07.434 --> 21:08.501
CONRAD: With the amount
of chemo Lane gave her,

21:08.535 --> 21:10.670
I'm worried the dosages
also damaged her heart.

21:12.305 --> 21:13.973
All right.

21:14.006 --> 21:17.677
You bought a good hour
of my time by helping out.

21:17.710 --> 21:20.647
Why do you do it?
What drives you?

21:20.680 --> 21:22.649
Uh, grew up in a church.

21:22.682 --> 21:25.652
Service to the poor,
the needy, the stranger--

21:25.685 --> 21:28.254
it's in my DNA. You know,
I'm a lapsed Catholic, at best,

21:28.287 --> 21:32.525
but the drive to reach people
others ignore is still there.

21:32.559 --> 21:35.127
You did a stint
on a Navajo reservation

21:35.161 --> 21:37.597
-Yeah, that's where I learned
problems start upstream.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.466
You got to keep people
from getting sick to begin with.

21:39.499 --> 21:42.369
Vaccines are gonna do more
than rosaries.

21:42.402 --> 21:45.304
Now I hand out condoms
instead of prayers.

21:45.338 --> 21:49.676
-I noticed you're low
on basic supplies.
-I get more

21:49.709 --> 21:51.644
from the Georgia Prescription
Assistance Program next week.

21:51.678 --> 21:54.313
What if I could score
what you need now?

22:00.720 --> 22:03.222
This place could use some love.

22:03.255 --> 22:05.392
Well, if you know
any contractors

22:05.425 --> 22:08.361
jonesing to help
some people out, let me know.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.663
So why are you doing all this?

22:10.697 --> 22:12.699
Knock-knock.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.300
Oh, sorry, sir,

22:14.333 --> 22:16.302
we're not actually open
right now.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.304
Oh, okay, uh,
I-I just saw the sign and...

22:18.337 --> 22:20.039
What's going on here?

22:20.072 --> 22:23.543
I was playing catch with my kid
and, uh, took one in the eye.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.545
-Oh.
-Can't really see
anything out of it.

22:25.578 --> 22:27.580
-Russell.

22:27.614 --> 22:29.682
Let me just look
at this eye, Russell.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.918
Yeah, orbital compartment
syndrome.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.386
Yeah, if we don't relieve

22:33.420 --> 22:35.154
some of that pressure,
he's gonna lose his eye.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.156
Do I have to go to the ER?

22:37.189 --> 22:39.392
I have lousy insurance.
Huge deductible.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.694
And I just paid
my student loans.

22:41.728 --> 22:44.263
Uh... you'll need
an ophthalmology consult

22:44.296 --> 22:46.699
in the ER after this, but
we can do the procedure here.

22:46.733 --> 22:47.767
Yeah, we have
everything we need here,

22:47.800 --> 22:49.769
and it'll save you some money.

22:49.802 --> 22:52.204
Okay.

22:52.238 --> 22:54.874
*

23:01.581 --> 23:03.382
-Here you go.

23:03.416 --> 23:04.417
Thanks.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.525
Okay, you ready?

23:12.559 --> 23:13.526
Just breathe.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.894
Okay.

23:17.764 --> 23:20.533
All right, let's see.
What about that?

23:20.567 --> 23:22.602
-Mm-mm.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.370
Good.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.172
All right.

23:34.581 --> 23:35.948
There you go.

23:35.982 --> 23:36.949
:
There we go.

23:36.983 --> 23:38.651
There you go.
There you go.

23:38.685 --> 23:40.286
My eye still there?

23:40.319 --> 23:41.754
Still there.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.790
ALEC:
Congrats.

23:43.823 --> 23:46.559
Looks like your clinic
just treated its first patient.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.628
Well, he still needs
that consult, so it looks like

23:48.661 --> 23:50.463
you're going to Chastain
after all.

23:50.497 --> 23:53.099
Natalie definitely has
chemo-induced cardiomyopathy.

23:53.132 --> 23:54.801
And the compression fracture

23:54.834 --> 23:57.069
has a large bone fragment
that's causing

23:57.103 --> 23:58.838
-her spinal cord compression.
-CONRAD: Decompression
and fusion

23:58.871 --> 24:00.507
is the only way to give her

24:00.540 --> 24:02.975
-a chance of walking.
-We need to get in there now.

24:03.009 --> 24:05.512
Implant the cage here
for spine fusion.

24:05.545 --> 24:07.246
AUSTIN: Her heart might not
be strong enough.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.081
-She's in the ICU
on an amio drip.
-We can try

24:09.115 --> 24:10.483
to manage it with ACE inhibitors

24:10.517 --> 24:11.684
-and beta-blockers...
-We don't have time.

24:11.718 --> 24:13.352
We've got three,
maybe four hours

24:13.385 --> 24:15.655
before the compression
becomes irreversible.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.289
If she survives surgery.

24:20.560 --> 24:23.863
Lane took
Natalie's choices away.

24:23.896 --> 24:27.534
We're giving her this one back.

24:27.567 --> 24:28.535
I came in
for some damn stitches!

24:28.568 --> 24:29.836
Natalie, they're trying to help.

24:29.869 --> 24:32.204
This is crap!
My options are

24:32.238 --> 24:33.940
full paralysis
or possible death?

24:33.973 --> 24:35.307
Or full recovery.
That's the hope.

24:35.341 --> 24:36.643
KIT:
We do the fusion

24:36.676 --> 24:38.444
while monitoring
your cardiac function.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.847
NATALIE:
You're the heart guy, right?

24:40.880 --> 24:41.848
So?

24:41.881 --> 24:43.015
Well, under
normal circumstances,

24:43.049 --> 24:44.450
I would advise against it,

24:44.483 --> 24:47.386
but these are not
normal circumstances.

24:49.756 --> 24:50.857
Dr. Hawkins...

24:50.890 --> 24:52.892
what would you do?

24:58.230 --> 25:00.533
You are the one who's gonna have
to live with this decision,

25:00.567 --> 25:03.235
so you are the one
who needs to make it.

25:03.269 --> 25:06.405
But if it was me...

25:06.438 --> 25:10.009
I am not letting
Lane Hunter hold me down.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.545
I'm taking the risk.

25:14.781 --> 25:17.183
Crap.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.187
I got to try.

25:26.693 --> 25:28.861
-You gave me a scare.
-They said...

25:28.895 --> 25:31.197
I almost died.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.299
I'm sorry I wasn't here.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.368
I shouldn't have left you.

25:36.402 --> 25:39.739
Always taking the weight
of the world on your shoulders.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.841
The blame.

25:41.874 --> 25:44.443
Not this time.

25:44.476 --> 25:46.512
Well, you asked
for one thing: no Bell.

25:47.780 --> 25:49.682
I guess he's better
than nothing.

26:00.426 --> 26:03.229
I want things to change for us.

26:03.262 --> 26:06.599
I've waited a long time
to hear those words.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.735
Well, hey, we're both stubborn.

26:08.768 --> 26:11.604
Yeah, that's... that's true.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.876
Hmm.

26:16.909 --> 26:20.446
I have spent half my life
without a father.

26:21.781 --> 26:23.950
We're gonna fix that.

26:23.983 --> 26:26.819
CONRAD:
I'm gonna hold you to that.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.035
Thank you.

26:44.871 --> 26:48.074
Excuse me, um, I'm looking
for Dr. Bell's office.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.242
Tenth floor.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.478
Hey, uh, you're
Julian's boss, right?

26:52.511 --> 26:53.612
Yeah. Gordon Page.

26:53.646 --> 26:56.148
Devon Pravesh.
Have you spoken

26:56.182 --> 26:58.350
-No. She didn't show up
for work.

26:58.384 --> 27:00.019
Had to get a replacement.

27:00.052 --> 27:02.121
A no-show isn't like her,
but I guess it's

27:02.154 --> 27:04.590
because of what
she's been going through.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.459
Yeah. She, um, mentioned
some issues with work.

27:07.493 --> 27:09.662
Really

27:10.863 --> 27:12.264
Honestly, not much.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.766
Yeah, Julian told
someone in the office

27:13.800 --> 27:16.002
that she got too close
to a doctor at Chastain,

27:16.035 --> 27:17.970
and it turned into more
than she wanted.

27:18.004 --> 27:20.539
I just hope he didn't
scare her off. She's good.

27:20.572 --> 27:22.541
Anyway, thanks
for the directions.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.181
Great news.
Ophthalmology says

27:29.215 --> 27:31.150
that Russell's eye
is looking good.

27:31.183 --> 27:33.052
They're gonna keep him
overnight for observation.

27:33.085 --> 27:35.221
Is that necessary?
It's gonna rack up a bill

27:35.254 --> 27:36.723
-he won't be able to pay.
-Hey.

27:36.756 --> 27:38.290
-ALEC: I doubt
you can do anything

27:38.324 --> 27:39.558
about a bloated hospital
billing system

27:39.591 --> 27:41.828
that charges 300 bucks
for an aspirin.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.329
Conrad, this is Dr. Shaw.

27:43.362 --> 27:44.731
Alec, Dr. Hawkins.

27:44.764 --> 27:46.833
-We're trying to get him
to run the clinic.
-Ah.

27:46.866 --> 27:48.701
Can't get past
the toxic hospital culture,

27:48.735 --> 27:49.869
the lack of transparency,

27:49.902 --> 27:51.137
the endless documentation...

27:51.170 --> 27:52.739
Don't forget about the upcoding,

27:52.772 --> 27:54.673
fragmentation of care,
over-testing, overtreatment.

27:54.707 --> 27:56.976
-Not helping.
-Look, we know

27:57.009 --> 27:58.811
we're going up against Goliath.

27:58.845 --> 28:01.180
And it's true,
all we got's a slingshot.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.515
But we have damn good aim.

28:03.549 --> 28:06.218
Well, it seems like a waste
of both your talents.

28:06.252 --> 28:08.154
I do my own thing.
Sorry.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.388
Eh. No worries.

28:09.421 --> 28:10.890
Just remember, wars are fought
on the battlefield,

28:10.923 --> 28:12.224
not from the sidelines.

28:12.258 --> 28:13.760
Look, let me buy you
a cup of coffee,

28:13.793 --> 28:15.494
-introduce you to the team...
-No, I got to get back.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.197
It's nice meeting you, Nic.

28:19.799 --> 28:22.534
:
Damn. He was perfect.

28:24.937 --> 28:27.139
I don't believe it.

28:40.086 --> 28:41.520
AUSTIN:
Deflating the lung.

28:43.990 --> 28:46.158
Dr. Voss,
you have spinal access.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.528
KIT: I would have risked
the surgery, too.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.130
Really? You would

28:51.163 --> 28:53.866
risk it all just for a chance
of something better?

28:53.900 --> 28:55.534
MINA: For the chance
at the life you want,

28:55.567 --> 28:57.069
so would I.

28:58.938 --> 29:00.139
KIT:
Oh, hell.

29:00.172 --> 29:02.308
The bone is weak from the chemo.

29:02.341 --> 29:04.710
-I can't get fixation.
-What about a graft
from her hip?

29:04.743 --> 29:06.312
We can't get it fast enough.

29:06.345 --> 29:08.647
Dr. Okafor, what's our move?

29:10.682 --> 29:12.584
Let me see her X-rays.

29:15.321 --> 29:16.823
All right, show me her ribs.

29:20.359 --> 29:23.062
They're less damaged. We
can make a graft from her ribs.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.431
How long do you think
it'll take? Her echo was showing

29:25.464 --> 29:26.966
severely depressed
ejection fraction.

29:26.999 --> 29:28.367
We'll have to move fast, then.

29:35.707 --> 29:37.276
Julian?

29:45.117 --> 29:46.853
Hey, it's Devon.

29:46.886 --> 29:48.520
Are you okay?

29:49.856 --> 29:51.824
Look, I know
I shouldn't be here,

29:51.858 --> 29:55.127
but, um, what you said
about QuoVadis...

29:55.161 --> 29:57.763
we should talk about it.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.966
We should talk about everything.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.601
Just call me.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.470
Please.

30:15.214 --> 30:17.749
-All right, he's gone.

30:18.750 --> 30:19.952
Mr. Page?

30:19.986 --> 30:21.954
Yeah, the place is clean.

30:21.988 --> 30:24.723
Someone came by.

30:24.756 --> 30:26.325
Yeah, same guy.

30:28.895 --> 30:30.729
Security's on the way.

30:30.762 --> 30:34.200
This office is a shrine
to your ego.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.702
Lacking confidence without me?

30:36.735 --> 30:38.337
Hardly.
You have about two minutes

30:38.370 --> 30:40.907
to say whatever it is
you came here to say.

30:40.940 --> 30:44.643
You know, words aren't getting
through to you, Randolph.

30:44.676 --> 30:48.380
So I thought that this... might.

30:52.284 --> 30:55.387
Really brings out
the desperation in your eyes,

30:55.421 --> 30:57.356
don't you think?

30:57.389 --> 30:59.558
Where did you get that?

30:59.591 --> 31:01.593
That lawyer you found me,

31:01.627 --> 31:03.429
he can dig up anything.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.831
Now, tell me something.
What do you think is worse?

31:05.864 --> 31:07.866
Trying to buy sex
from an undercover cop

31:07.900 --> 31:10.536
or failing to self-report
your arrest

31:10.569 --> 31:12.604
to the State Medical Board?

31:14.806 --> 31:16.943
So, where's the copier?

31:16.976 --> 31:18.911
I think everyone

31:18.945 --> 31:21.547
-will want their very own.
-You're a monster.

31:22.748 --> 31:24.716
Look around, Randolph.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.852
Either you agree
to tell the jury

31:26.885 --> 31:28.887
how wrong you were about me,

31:28.921 --> 31:31.557
or all of this disappears.

31:31.590 --> 31:33.359
You can call off your dogs.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.894
Happy to show myself out.

31:38.830 --> 31:40.799
*

31:47.573 --> 31:49.976
MARSHALL:
Nice of you to stop by.

31:51.978 --> 31:54.313
Sorry.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.148
Busy morning.

31:56.182 --> 31:58.084
You're recovering well.

31:58.117 --> 32:00.752
Hematocrit's stable.
Kidney function's good.

32:00.786 --> 32:02.421
I'm a little surprised
you didn't kill me

32:02.454 --> 32:03.922
when you had the chance.

32:06.292 --> 32:08.160
You know, my first year
as an attending,

32:08.194 --> 32:10.963
they brought a guy into my OR
with six bullet holes.

32:10.997 --> 32:12.731
He killed two cops,
and everybody said

32:12.764 --> 32:14.233
he deserved to die.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.402
When I pick up a scalpel,
I don't care

32:16.435 --> 32:17.903
who's on the other end.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.738
That's the discipline.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.441
I'm a surgeon first.
That's all that matters to me.

32:22.474 --> 32:25.111
Oh, so you wanted to kill me,
but you were...

32:25.144 --> 32:26.812
too principled.

32:26.845 --> 32:28.347
That's charming.

32:41.627 --> 32:42.995
You paged me?

32:43.029 --> 32:45.664
You don't 911-page me
to come to you.

32:45.697 --> 32:46.865
That's Natalie Ramirez.

32:46.898 --> 32:48.767
Lane Hunter ruined her life.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.203
Destroyed her heart
and her spine

32:51.237 --> 32:52.471
with chemo that she didn't need.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.973
And now she may die in that OR.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.210
And she's one of the lucky ones.

32:58.244 --> 33:00.212
You think I don't care?
I do.

33:00.246 --> 33:03.182
Then why was Lane
in your office?

33:06.552 --> 33:08.887
Guess what.
I am sick and tired

33:08.920 --> 33:11.990
of you thinking you have
any right to question me.

33:12.024 --> 33:12.991
You're a resident.

33:13.025 --> 33:14.793
Who I would love to fire.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.795
Except your father,
whose life I just saved--

33:16.828 --> 33:18.030
thank you very much--

33:18.064 --> 33:19.465
would fire me.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.067
So you got me down here
to see this woman.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.035
I've seen her.

33:23.069 --> 33:24.070
Good for you.

33:24.103 --> 33:26.405
Made my day.

33:26.438 --> 33:27.873
If Lane gets off,
how many others

33:27.906 --> 33:30.042
like Natalie will there be?

33:44.123 --> 33:45.857
KIT:
This should do the trick.

33:45.891 --> 33:46.858
MINA:
Spinal nerves

33:46.892 --> 33:47.859
still viable.

33:51.297 --> 33:52.531
AUSTIN:
She's in V tach again.

33:52.564 --> 33:53.699
Wet laps.

33:53.732 --> 33:55.101
AUSTIN:
The anesthesia

33:55.134 --> 33:56.768
is too much for her heart.
We need to stop.

33:56.802 --> 33:57.936
KIT:
Get the cage and screws ready.

33:57.969 --> 33:59.905
-MINA: Clear.
-Just let me finish fusing.

33:59.938 --> 34:01.073
-Clear!
-It's in.

34:05.977 --> 34:08.114
AUSTIN:
On three. One, two, three.

34:08.147 --> 34:10.116
Clear.

34:12.484 --> 34:13.752
She needs double
sequential defibrillation.

34:13.785 --> 34:16.054
Give her another 150 amio.

34:16.088 --> 34:17.156
Start a procainamide drip.

34:20.959 --> 34:23.495
Clear.
And go.

34:29.235 --> 34:32.471
She doesn't have the time
you need to finish the spine.

34:32.504 --> 34:34.740
We need to take her back
to the ICU, let her stabilize.

34:34.773 --> 34:36.074
We do that, she's paralyzed.

34:36.108 --> 34:37.609
We don't and she's dead.

34:37.643 --> 34:39.345
Can you stabilize her here?

34:41.113 --> 34:42.981
Central line to assess
the cardiac index

34:43.014 --> 34:45.551
and output numbers.
How long would it take, Okafor?

34:45.584 --> 34:46.618
For most, five minutes.
For you, four.

34:46.652 --> 34:48.154
And if she needs
ventricular assist?

34:48.187 --> 34:49.755
20 to deploy percutaneously.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.923
Her spine can stay in a sterile
dressing while you work.

34:51.957 --> 34:54.092
I need 30 to finish,
then we get her back to ICU.

34:54.126 --> 34:55.827
AUSTIN:
All right. Heart first,

34:55.861 --> 34:57.829
then spine,
if she's still stable.

34:57.863 --> 35:00.499
MINA: And if her spinal cord
is still viable.

35:12.344 --> 35:13.812
ALEC:
Nic?

35:13.845 --> 35:15.581
You're here.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.683
Grant applications.

35:17.716 --> 35:19.451
All day...

35:19.485 --> 35:21.253
I've been trying
to get you to join us.

35:21.287 --> 35:22.654
And it has been...

35:22.688 --> 35:25.491
a day.

35:25.524 --> 35:28.327
There's so much I can't fix.

35:28.360 --> 35:31.830
But this, this clinic...

35:31.863 --> 35:34.300
I can do.

35:34.333 --> 35:37.636
And I'll do it without you.

35:37.669 --> 35:39.137
Don't get me wrong--

35:39.171 --> 35:40.806
what you're doing here is great.

35:40.839 --> 35:43.809
But is it really
about the patients?

35:43.842 --> 35:45.844
Seems like...

35:45.877 --> 35:49.147
you'd rather rail
against a broken system

35:49.181 --> 35:50.816
than actually fight
to change it.

35:50.849 --> 35:52.384
You serious?

35:52.418 --> 35:54.820
I spent the better part
of my life in service.

35:54.853 --> 35:56.322
All I do is fight.

35:56.355 --> 35:59.090
Well, maybe not hard enough.

36:05.564 --> 36:07.533
HANCOCK:
So, this is about one

36:07.566 --> 36:09.134
-Julian Booth.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.538
Um... she never showed up
for work today

36:12.571 --> 36:15.073
and is not the type
to just disappear.

36:15.106 --> 36:16.342
Well, do you have reason
to believe

36:16.375 --> 36:17.543
that someone
could have hurt her?

36:17.576 --> 36:19.811
There's a guy
you may want to look into.

36:19.845 --> 36:22.514
Um, he's an intern at Chastain.

36:22.548 --> 36:25.351
His name is Devon Pravesh.

36:27.719 --> 36:29.855
This is her work phone.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.189
We found it at her desk.

36:45.937 --> 36:48.940
Mm, I'm alive.

36:48.974 --> 36:51.109
And you're gonna stay that way.

36:51.142 --> 36:52.778
We had to place
a ventricular device

36:52.811 --> 36:55.046
to keep your heart
pumping effectively,

36:55.080 --> 36:57.616
and we'll schedule a transplant
eval when you're healed.

36:57.649 --> 37:00.386
Right now
it's working perfectly.

37:00.419 --> 37:01.753
KIT:
And after PT

37:01.787 --> 37:04.690
and rehab,
you'll be able to walk again.

37:04.723 --> 37:07.393
Will I be able to go back
to the police force?

37:07.426 --> 37:09.861
We don't know that yet.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.264
But...

37:12.298 --> 37:14.600
you are gonna lose that cane.

37:14.633 --> 37:16.402
That much I can promise you.

37:16.435 --> 37:17.903
NATALIE:
I hate that thing.

37:20.806 --> 37:22.808
ROGER:
You deserve to be happy.

37:25.777 --> 37:27.746
NATALIE:
So do you.

37:27.779 --> 37:30.849
Your sister
would've wanted that.

37:34.119 --> 37:35.754
Thanks, guys.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.075
Easy on the hot water.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.777
Sit when you pee.

37:58.810 --> 38:01.647
You may use my condiments,
but do not touch my alcohol.

38:02.681 --> 38:04.316
I would never.

38:04.350 --> 38:06.318
Outside of the guest room,
it's either clothing

38:06.352 --> 38:08.320
or a bathrobe
with full coverage.

38:08.354 --> 38:10.288
I don't want any surprises.

38:10.322 --> 38:12.324
Why are you helping me?

38:12.358 --> 38:14.960
Because you need it.

38:19.998 --> 38:21.700
Wayne Jackson.

38:21.733 --> 38:24.770
In asystole for 15 minutes
before anyone noticed.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.304
Kathy Mars.
The hospital

38:26.338 --> 38:28.440
billed her 12 grand
for a damn bee sting.

38:28.474 --> 38:31.710
Matthew Teter came in
with stage IV colon cancer.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.845
He would've lived
if he'd had early detection.

38:33.879 --> 38:35.947
Every time I thought I got close
to making things better,

38:35.981 --> 38:40.118
I saw another patient lose
to a broken system.

38:40.151 --> 38:43.522
So, yes, it is
about the patients for me.

38:43.555 --> 38:47.325
But you're crazy if you think
you can change things.

38:47.359 --> 38:50.161
Maybe I am.

38:56.868 --> 38:59.671
I like crazy.

39:05.677 --> 39:08.179
-Yeah, sure.
-Here.

39:08.213 --> 39:10.749
NIC :
We'll just, uh, get these...

39:10.782 --> 39:12.418
ALEC:
So the pay sucks.

39:12.451 --> 39:14.420
Beyond sucks.

39:14.453 --> 39:16.755
And Chastain could slash
our funding at any time?

39:16.788 --> 39:18.089
Without warning.

39:18.123 --> 39:20.459
I won't be bossed around.

39:21.927 --> 39:23.995
You start tomorrow.

39:24.029 --> 39:25.731
I start now.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.936
Congratulations.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.738
You graduated from the ICU.

39:32.771 --> 39:35.006
Eh. Yeah, unfortunately,

39:35.040 --> 39:36.742
not from clear liquids.

39:36.775 --> 39:38.944
You need something for the pain?

39:38.977 --> 39:39.945
MARSHALL:
No.

39:39.978 --> 39:42.614
No, I want to be alert for this.

39:42.648 --> 39:47.052
Son, I've been fighting
this disease for a while now.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.587
I got lucky this time,

39:48.620 --> 39:51.089
but it only gets worse
from here.

39:51.122 --> 39:54.359
Dr. Simmons says you will be
back on semisolid foods

39:54.392 --> 39:55.761
in a week.
In two to three days,

39:55.794 --> 39:56.895
you will be out of the hospital

39:56.928 --> 39:58.630
and starting physical therapy.

39:58.664 --> 40:01.399
-You will get
your strength back.
-We both know

40:01.433 --> 40:04.636
my chances for a meaningful
recovery become less

40:04.670 --> 40:06.638
and less
with each surgery I have.

40:06.672 --> 40:08.974
I need you to stay positive.

40:09.007 --> 40:12.043
Patients who believe they'll
recover have better outcomes.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.279
Positive thinking
won't change what's happening

40:14.312 --> 40:16.482
to this body of mine.

40:16.515 --> 40:19.451
I'd like to formalize things.

40:25.591 --> 40:28.560
You want an advanced directive.

40:28.594 --> 40:30.428
If something like this

40:30.462 --> 40:32.464
happens to me again,

40:32.498 --> 40:35.634
I don't want my life prolonged

40:35.667 --> 40:37.903
by aggressive measures.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.471
That's a long way off.

40:39.505 --> 40:41.573
I'm serious.

40:41.607 --> 40:44.810
I need to know
you'll respect my wishes.

40:46.812 --> 40:49.214
Of course.

40:50.849 --> 40:53.485
Thank you.

40:55.353 --> 40:57.288
*

41:17.976 --> 41:21.146
BELL:
Dear Board of Directors,

41:21.179 --> 41:23.615
Leading this hospital

41:23.649 --> 41:25.784
has been a joy and a privilege.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.953
However, in the coming days,

41:27.986 --> 41:31.189
you will learn of a terrible
mistake I have made.

41:31.222 --> 41:33.358
I betrayed your trust.

41:33.391 --> 41:35.460
You deserve someone
who will always put

41:35.493 --> 41:36.795
this community first.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.363
And I am deeply ashamed

41:38.396 --> 41:41.366
that I have not always been
that person.

41:41.399 --> 41:43.969
I put my trust
in the wrong person.

41:45.704 --> 41:48.406
Coming.

41:52.110 --> 41:55.547
And I take full responsibility
for my actions.

42:09.895 --> 42:13.765
I will step down and step away.

42:13.799 --> 42:16.367
I hereby resign as CEO

42:16.401 --> 42:18.770
and Chief of Surgery.

42:18.804 --> 42:21.973
Dr. Randolph Bell.

42:26.277 --> 42:28.513
Uh, Dr. Bell?

42:28.546 --> 42:29.881
You need to see this.

42:29.915 --> 42:31.382
Grayson, what?

42:31.416 --> 42:33.251
It's the news.

42:33.284 --> 42:36.421
NEWSCASTER: ...shots fired
in a Buckhead hotel.

42:36.454 --> 42:37.923
Police report
they found the body

42:37.956 --> 42:40.191
of accused murderer
Dr. Lane Hunter.

42:40.225 --> 42:42.127
Recently out on bail
after several months

42:42.160 --> 42:44.529
in the Atlanta
Detention Center,

42:44.562 --> 42:46.264
Hunter was arrested
for first-degree murder

42:46.297 --> 42:48.466
and involuntary manslaughter,

42:48.499 --> 42:51.569
as well as insurance fraud
and money laundering.

42:51.603 --> 42:55.306
No suspects have been named
in her death.

42:55.340 --> 42:57.108
In related news,
victim rights advocates...

42:57.142 --> 42:59.477
Um... thank you, Grayson.

42:59.510 --> 43:00.779
You can go.

43:00.812 --> 43:01.780
NEWSCASTER:
Not stepping forward,

43:01.813 --> 43:03.581
not commenting on the death.

43:03.615 --> 43:07.085
Many of them vocal just months
ago, and now they're not...

44:11.049 --> 44:13.018
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:15.420 --> 44:17.188
You survived your shift
with The Resident.

44:17.222 --> 44:19.758
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:22.093 --> 44:23.895
Welcome to the galaxy.

44:25.096 --> 44:27.065
Should be fun. I'll lead.

44:28.900 --> 44:31.803
* We're breaking waves
Shooting stars *

44:31.837 --> 44:33.171
We're gonna make a run for it.

44:33.204 --> 44:34.405
* Live for glory, not forever *

44:34.439 --> 44:38.877
-Go!
-* Reach out *

44:38.910 --> 44:42.480
* Make this right here
Right now *

44:42.513 --> 44:46.251
* Stand up *

44:46.284 --> 44:49.054
-* Here right now *
-Now!
