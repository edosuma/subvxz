<i> # No way of knowing</i>

03:06.381 --> 03:10.511
<i># No way of knowing</i>
<i>if I care or not #</i>

03:12.687 --> 03:17.090
- Only two more good mornings.
- Only one more day.

03:17.159 --> 03:21.118
- We're so perfect.
- Immaculate.

03:24.366 --> 03:27.096
<i># And I'm alive #</i>

03:27.169 --> 03:29.103
<i># And I'm alone #</i>

03:29.171 --> 03:36.007
<i># And I've never wanted to</i>

03:58.934 --> 04:01.994
<i># And she shines #</i>

04:02.070 --> 04:06.473

04:30.632 --> 04:34.693
<i># No way of knowing</i>

04:42.644 --> 04:45.169
<i>- Shit.</i>

04:59.828 --> 05:02.023
- Kill it!
- What?

05:02.097 --> 05:04.156
Turn it off!

05:12.707 --> 05:14.641
Doesn't look too good.

05:14.709 --> 05:17.269
Okay. Well, now what?

05:22.517 --> 05:24.451
We wait?

05:26.021 --> 05:27.955
For?

05:28.023 --> 05:30.014
Anything.

05:31.493 --> 05:33.961
That's your plan.

05:34.029 --> 05:35.963
You got a better one?

06:53.708 --> 06:56.438
Sam, wake up.
Someone's coming.

07:04.786 --> 07:07.152
Hey.

07:11.493 --> 07:14.519
- What's goin' on?
- Our car broke down.

07:14.596 --> 07:16.928
Your friend okay?

07:16.998 --> 07:18.989
She's dead.

07:21.870 --> 07:25.067
Roadkill.

07:25.140 --> 07:27.074
Froze to death.

07:28.810 --> 07:30.744
Yeah, that happens.

07:40.622 --> 07:42.556
You all right?

07:43.558 --> 07:45.458
Fine.

07:45.527 --> 07:49.361
See, she's an ice queen.
You need a flamethrower to get inside that.

07:53.501 --> 07:56.197
- So, you want me to take a look?
- Where?

07:56.271 --> 07:58.933
- Under the hood.
- Sure.

08:01.543 --> 08:03.477
Ow.

08:05.947 --> 08:08.415
<i>Well, you can't drive it.</i>

08:08.483 --> 08:12.317
<i>Look, Conejo Springs is just up the road.</i>
<i>I can give you a ride.</i>

08:23.364 --> 08:26.993
Water pump's gone. I can order you a new one.
Might take a day or two.

08:27.068 --> 08:29.798
<i>- How much?</i>
<i>- Oh, couple of hundred. Maybe more.</i>

08:29.871 --> 08:32.135
<i>Is this the only show</i>
<i>in town, or-</i>

08:32.207 --> 08:34.801
You want me to charge you
for that tow, no problem.

08:34.876 --> 08:38.243
That's a hundred bucks right there.
But it's free for customers.

08:38.313 --> 08:41.770
- Oh, so that's how you do it.
- I could fix it.

08:41.850 --> 08:45.013
<i>Is it all right if I look around</i>
<i>in your junkyard, Mr. Pickford?</i>

08:45.086 --> 08:47.020
Parts is parts.

08:47.088 --> 08:49.784
You never know.
You just might get lucky.

08:49.858 --> 08:53.157
<i>- Mmm. </i>
- What?

08:53.228 --> 08:55.196
- Might get lucky.
- He didn't mean it like that.

08:55.263 --> 08:57.458
- Mm-hmm. Parts is parts.
- Leave me alone.

08:57.532 --> 09:00.592
<i>- You guys need a ride to the motel?</i>
- Hell, yeah.

09:00.668 --> 09:04.627
- How far is it?
- Just around the corner- like everything.

09:04.706 --> 09:08.608
- Well, we could walk.
- What about your stuff?

09:08.676 --> 09:11.167
- Empty bags of chips are yours.
- And the hula hoop?

09:15.884 --> 09:18.682
So, can we, like, get a bottle
on the way, or something?

09:18.753 --> 09:20.687
It's a free country.

09:20.755 --> 09:23.588
Oh, well, I guess
you got yourself a job, mister.

09:54.889 --> 09:56.914
<i>Thanks.</i>

10:00.061 --> 10:01.995
So you guys want me to wait?

10:02.063 --> 10:05.726
Oh, we can handle it ourselves.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.791
Well, you got my number.

10:09.938 --> 10:11.769
What is wrong with you?

10:11.840 --> 10:13.774
Nothing.

10:13.842 --> 10:16.276
Can't you even pretend to be happy?

10:30.325 --> 10:32.418
However, Marcia Clark
may have to reschedule-

10:34.295 --> 10:36.729
Judge Ito will determine
later today-

10:36.798 --> 10:39.699
Space shuttle ain't blastin' off
till next month.

10:39.767 --> 10:42.201
<i>- Is that a fact?</i>
- Oh.

10:44.205 --> 10:48.335
You gals not with
the <i>Star Trek</i> club, are you?

10:48.409 --> 10:53.574
<i>- Got wait-listed.</i>
- It's a pretty picky bunch. What can I do you for?

10:53.648 --> 10:55.582
We need a room.

10:55.650 --> 10:57.811
Oh. Only got one that's finished.

10:59.921 --> 11:02.219
In the process of beautifyin'.

11:02.290 --> 11:04.383
- How much is it?
- How many you stayin'?

11:04.459 --> 11:08.088
- Forever, we hope.
- Just a couple.

11:08.162 --> 11:10.630
I'll give you the daily rate.

11:12.233 --> 11:14.258
Honeymoon suite.

11:14.335 --> 11:16.235
What happened to that little boy?

11:16.304 --> 11:18.738
Oh.

11:18.806 --> 11:23.675
<i>He went missin'.</i>
<i>Not the first around here neither.</i>

11:23.745 --> 11:27.841
Kids, they do the darndest things.

11:27.916 --> 11:31.147
<i> Well, don't worry about us.</i>
<i>We're little angels.</i>

12:00.181 --> 12:03.014
A little ketchup up at the top.

12:06.187 --> 12:08.985
There we go.
All right, you ready?

12:09.057 --> 12:11.321
It's this simple.
How long is this gonna take, champ?

12:11.392 --> 12:13.519
Well, less than two minutes.

12:13.594 --> 12:16.654
- Say that again.
- Less than two minutes.

12:19.267 --> 12:21.258
Two minutes?

12:41.389 --> 12:46.554
Everything will be cold and dark.

12:47.996 --> 12:49.987
<i>Are you ready to die?</i>

13:04.479 --> 13:06.413
Are you afraid?

13:07.882 --> 13:09.816
I'm a good soldier.

13:09.884 --> 13:11.818
<i>Everything dies.</i>

13:14.422 --> 13:16.356
She told me you would come.

13:16.424 --> 13:18.824
Shh.

13:24.599 --> 13:26.533
<i>Save yourself.</i>

13:31.072 --> 13:34.872
Four days, 17 hours...

13:34.942 --> 13:39.038
26 minutes, 31 seconds.

13:40.314 --> 13:43.408
That is when the world will end.

13:52.994 --> 13:54.928
Follow me.

14:36.204 --> 14:39.640
I'm afraid I can't
let you sleep here.

14:39.707 --> 14:41.698
Must've been quite a night.

14:43.578 --> 14:46.206
You got anyplace to be?

14:46.280 --> 14:49.215
Oh, I'm sure somebody's
waitin' for you somewhere.

14:49.283 --> 14:52.844
My friend Corey- at the motel.

14:52.920 --> 14:56.720
Come on. Up you go.

14:58.025 --> 14:59.959
Upsy-daisy.

15:03.831 --> 15:05.822
You know, there's a pervert
loose in town.

15:05.900 --> 15:08.869
Goes by Iraq Jack,
but that ain't his real name.

15:08.936 --> 15:13.267
Can't be, uh, dressin' like-
like that.

15:15.903 --> 15:18.030
The one who took, uh,
the little boy?

15:18.106 --> 15:21.542
It ain't a proven fact,
but I'd bet the farm on it.

15:21.609 --> 15:24.271
I- I support Desert Storm
and everything...

15:24.345 --> 15:28.111
but when the boys come home
with voices in their head...

15:28.182 --> 15:31.618
then it becomes my problem.

15:31.686 --> 15:34.655
<i> O'Dell, respond to</i>
<i>a 211 at Frank Pickford's place.</i>

15:34.722 --> 15:36.713
Copy. 10-17.

15:38.726 --> 15:41.058
Tell you what. Hop in.
I'll give you a ride.

15:41.129 --> 15:43.063
It's right by the motel.

16:13.361 --> 16:17.855
Unbelievable. Do you know how much
that old windmill was worth?

16:17.932 --> 16:22.767
<i> Sell this thing off to some</i>
<i>meteorological nerd club, you might just do okay.</i>

16:22.837 --> 16:26.136
<i>- Really? You think?</i>
<i>- I'd sure like to borrow it.</i>

16:26.207 --> 16:29.074
It's a message in a bottle
from aliens, right?

16:31.145 --> 16:33.375
That was almost funny, Pete,
you meathead.

16:33.447 --> 16:37.474
- What is all this stuff?
- Oh, it's that nut job, Iraq Jack.

16:37.552 --> 16:40.020
He's been squattin' up there
for a couple of months now...

16:40.087 --> 16:45.252
yellin' crap about the Acropolis
and universe justice or somethin'.

16:45.326 --> 16:49.888
<i>If there was any real justice left in this country,</i>
<i>he'd be hangin' by a noose right now.</i>

16:51.032 --> 16:54.798
Big ol' horseshit
from the sky if you ask me.

17:04.377 --> 17:06.938
That is some crazy shit.

17:07.013 --> 17:09.448
This town's got way beyond
its quota of crazy shit.

17:09.517 --> 17:13.681
- So where'd you sleepwalk to last night?
- Bus stop.

17:13.753 --> 17:17.053
<i>Do you remember anything this time?</i>

17:17.124 --> 17:20.525
<i>Nothing. Just blackness.</i>

17:20.595 --> 17:24.531
So I'm havin' a Fourth of July party later on.
You guys should come.

17:24.598 --> 17:26.692
<i>Fourth of July</i>
<i>is still four days away.</i>

17:26.767 --> 17:28.667
If you're stuck here, you might as well
have some fun. Right?

17:28.736 --> 17:31.432
- What about that water pump?
- I'll look for it later.

17:31.505 --> 17:34.804
- After you're done getting wasted?
- Oh, chill out.

17:42.683 --> 17:45.618
- That really sucks.
<i>- Being lost?</i>

17:45.686 --> 17:48.305
<i>- If I go missing, will you make</i>
<i>sure I look hot on my poster?</i>

17:48.306 --> 17:49.019
<i> Deal.</i>

17:49.090 --> 17:51.115
Take it easy, Trudy.

17:51.192 --> 17:53.126
Jesus loves you, Agatha.

17:53.194 --> 17:55.389
<i>Uh-huh.</i>
<i>Have a good one.</i>

17:55.463 --> 17:57.795
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

17:57.865 --> 18:01.164
- So, where you girls from?
- Uh, Virginia.

18:01.235 --> 18:03.965
I'm from Boise. Idaho.

18:04.038 --> 18:06.199
Watermelon Queen
for two years runnin'.

18:06.274 --> 18:08.936
- But I don't like to brag.
- Oh, you still got it.

18:09.010 --> 18:14.312
Oh, will you look at that
piece of filth out there?

18:14.382 --> 18:15.865
He's probably just hungry.

18:15.866 --> 18:18.944
Oh, no. That one don't deserve your pity.
Trust me.

18:19.020 --> 18:21.318
<i>He should've died</i>
<i>up on that windmill.</i>

18:21.389 --> 18:25.325
I was thinking
we chop off his balls and stone him.

18:25.393 --> 18:27.588
Light him on fire
if gas wasn't so expensive.

18:27.662 --> 18:30.062
You girls stay away from him, okay?

18:30.131 --> 18:34.500
<i>And let me know if you need anything-</i>
<i>anything at all.</i>

18:34.568 --> 18:36.229
<i>- Orange soda, please.</i>
<i>- Surely.</i>

18:43.577 --> 18:45.602
Can we help you?

18:45.680 --> 18:49.616
I'm sorry. I-I just recognized you.
I saw you by the motel.

18:49.684 --> 18:51.618
Pretty amazing stuff, huh?

18:51.686 --> 18:55.053
I-I just made a deal
to buy it for $600.

18:55.122 --> 18:58.580
- What's "it"?
- The meteorite.

18:58.659 --> 19:00.854
What the hell are you gonna do
with a friggin' meteor?

19:00.928 --> 19:03.260
A <i>meteorite,</i> actually.

19:03.331 --> 19:08.633
<i>Uh, well, I gotta run some tests,</i>
<i>but, if I had to guess, I'd say it's a siderite.</i>

19:08.703 --> 19:10.898
They're mostly composed
of iron and nickel.

19:13.007 --> 19:14.702
I'm Jeremy.

19:14.775 --> 19:17.573
- Are you a gay?
- What?

19:17.645 --> 19:19.545
Isn't Jeremy a gay name?

19:21.082 --> 19:23.277
- Enjoy your soda, sweetheart.
- Thank you.

19:23.351 --> 19:26.047
Okay, as soon as she walks
to the kitchen, run for it.

19:45.873 --> 19:49.309
I don't think you're a gay.

19:54.348 --> 19:56.782
Don't you think we should,
like, call your dad...

19:56.851 --> 19:58.944
and tell him that we're coming?

19:59.020 --> 20:01.011
Nah. I don't want him
to get worried.

20:01.088 --> 20:03.022
You don't want him to say no.

20:03.090 --> 20:06.287
Look, I just don't want
to be a burden, okay?

20:06.360 --> 20:09.523
Relax. He still owns
the club, all right?

20:09.597 --> 20:12.361
He's gonna get us both jobs.
I'm his daughter, for Chrissake.

20:12.433 --> 20:14.924
- Yeah, but he's still a guy.
- Yeah.

20:15.002 --> 20:19.530
And he knows this is pissing my mom off
to no end, which is totally in our favor.

20:19.607 --> 20:22.269
Your mom was really cool to me.

20:22.343 --> 20:25.744
Doesn't mean anything.
She just used you to get younger guys.

20:25.813 --> 20:28.373
At least I'm good for something.

20:28.449 --> 20:30.610
<i>Ever tag-team a 40-year-old?</i>

20:30.684 --> 20:32.618
- Don't.
- Hey.

20:36.524 --> 20:40.119
- You girls new in town?
- Just passing through.

20:40.194 --> 20:42.128
<i>Well, if you're gonna be around</i>
<i>a little while...</i>

20:42.196 --> 20:44.824
you might as well stop
and get some pizza at my Bible study.

20:44.899 --> 20:46.992
- It's a lot of fun.
- Oh, I'm satanic.

20:47.068 --> 20:50.970
She's half Jehovah, quarter Jew,
tiny bit retarded.

20:51.038 --> 20:53.598
<i>Mmm. Well, we're nondenominational.</i>

20:53.674 --> 20:57.337
We accept all types,
even those with horns.

20:57.411 --> 21:01.575
- What's it like to never be able to have sex?
- Excuse me?

21:01.649 --> 21:03.640
Do you just have
blue balls all the time...

21:03.717 --> 21:06.151
or you just have to spank it
constantly?

21:06.220 --> 21:10.623
Well, I haven't always had
a personal relationship with the Lord.

21:10.691 --> 21:15.993
But I'm not missing anything.
I used to be just like you.

21:16.063 --> 21:18.429
- What, you had a training bra?
<i>- Not exactly.</i>

21:18.499 --> 21:20.592
But when I was your age,
I experienced things...

21:20.668 --> 21:22.863
that made me feel
like God didn't exist.

21:24.305 --> 21:27.240
Maybe you've experienced
something like that too.

21:27.308 --> 21:30.835
- You don't know anything about me.
- I can see that you're in pain.

21:30.911 --> 21:34.904
- I'm alive.
- Is that how you see life?

21:34.982 --> 21:38.179
Till farts taste
like cherries, yeah.

21:39.620 --> 21:41.383
What do you think
God's farts taste like?

21:41.455 --> 21:44.185
Marshmallow Peeps.

21:44.258 --> 21:46.556
Well, you can make fun all you want.

21:47.695 --> 21:49.686
But that's just denial.

21:49.763 --> 21:51.196
Blow me.

21:54.702 --> 21:57.364
You make up your own mind.

21:57.438 --> 22:00.635
Read these words.

22:00.708 --> 22:03.040
God has all the time
in the world for you.

22:03.244 --> 22:06.771
Four days, nine hours...

22:08.782 --> 22:10.716
<i>five minutes...</i>

22:13.320 --> 22:17.154
39 seconds, 38 seconds...

22:17.224 --> 22:21.354
37 seconds, 36 seconds...

22:21.428 --> 22:25.421
35 seconds, 34 seconds...

22:25.499 --> 22:27.933
33 seconds-

22:29.203 --> 22:31.137
Frank know you're in here?

22:33.974 --> 22:36.067
Does he?

22:36.143 --> 22:38.475
I killed babies-

22:38.546 --> 22:42.983
<i>brains spilling out of their heads</i>
<i>like macaroni.</i>

22:43.050 --> 22:46.417
Tiny feet with little baby toes
blown off just-

22:46.487 --> 22:48.614
just lying in the road.

22:48.689 --> 22:52.489
You know, if you didn't dress and talk like that,
man, people wouldn't be so freaked out.

22:52.560 --> 22:55.723
<i>At least, lose the slingshot.</i>

22:55.796 --> 22:59.926
No. How would I fight back?

23:00.000 --> 23:05.666
All right. Keep the slingshot.
Lose the "camo."

23:05.739 --> 23:08.674
No. I- No.

23:09.777 --> 23:11.711
Then they could see me.

23:11.779 --> 23:15.875
Look, you'd better get outta here
before Frank comes back.

23:22.523 --> 23:26.550
- They made me do it.
- Who?

23:26.627 --> 23:29.619
- The leaders.
- Okay.

23:29.697 --> 23:31.995
She needs me.

23:32.066 --> 23:34.000
Who?

23:34.068 --> 23:37.629
- The princess.
- Right.

23:37.705 --> 23:40.401
Look, she saved me.

23:40.474 --> 23:42.465
She can- She can do anything.

23:45.946 --> 23:50.144
- She can even save Billy.
- What you know about Billy?

23:52.019 --> 23:54.453
Don't believe the milk carton.

23:54.521 --> 23:58.184
Get down!

24:00.928 --> 24:04.659
- Hey! Hey, can you hear me?
- You don't have to scream.

24:04.732 --> 24:06.996
You need to tell them, okay?
You tell everyone!

24:07.067 --> 24:10.901
- Tell 'em what?
- The world is going to end!

24:24.251 --> 24:27.220
<i>#You hobo humpin', slobo babe #</i>

24:27.288 --> 24:30.086
<i># A-get it off, get off</i>
<i>get off of me #</i>

24:30.157 --> 24:32.990
<i># You hobo humpin', slobo babe #</i>

24:33.060 --> 24:36.291
<i># A-get it off, get off</i>
<i>get off of me #</i>

24:36.363 --> 24:39.059
<i># Baby, we don't love ya</i>
<i>Baby, we don't love ya, baby, yeah #</i>

24:39.133 --> 24:41.761
<i># Baby, we don't love ya</i>
<i>Baby, we don't love ya, baby, yeah #</i>

24:41.835 --> 24:45.100
<i># Baby, we don't love ya</i>
<i>Baby, we don't love ya, baby, yeah #</i>

24:46.840 --> 24:49.707
<i>#Seeking candy #</i>

24:49.777 --> 24:52.405
<i># On the shore #</i>

24:52.479 --> 24:55.312
<i># Lost her eyesight #</i>

24:55.382 --> 24:58.078
<i># Teeth are poor#</i>

24:58.152 --> 25:00.950
<i># Left for dead #</i>

25:01.021 --> 25:03.819
<i># Back for more #</i>

25:03.891 --> 25:07.554
<i># Left for dead #</i>

25:09.630 --> 25:11.996
<i># Seeking candy #</i>

25:12.066 --> 25:15.001
<i># Who sleeps around #</i>

25:15.069 --> 25:17.902
<i># Afraid of tellin'#</i>

25:17.971 --> 25:20.701
<i># Tiny sounds #</i>

25:20.774 --> 25:23.538
<i># Left for dead #</i>

25:23.610 --> 25:26.374
<i># Left for good #</i>

25:26.447 --> 25:28.608
<i># Left for dead #</i>

25:28.682 --> 25:30.843
<i># Not understood #</i>

25:32.886 --> 25:35.377
Sorry.

25:41.795 --> 25:44.127
Oops.

25:44.198 --> 25:46.189
Sorry, man.

25:50.838 --> 25:52.772
Right under my nose.

25:56.009 --> 25:57.943
I wanted to buy your lunch.

25:58.011 --> 25:59.945
That's sweet.

26:02.282 --> 26:04.716
I don't usually come
to these kind of things.

26:04.785 --> 26:07.515
So, uh...

26:07.588 --> 26:09.522
why'd you come to this one?

26:09.590 --> 26:12.889
Well, I guess I thought,
you know, maybe if-

26:12.960 --> 26:15.724
Hey. You might wanna
check on your friend.

26:17.264 --> 26:19.198
<i>- # Broken kneecap #</i>

26:19.266 --> 26:22.793
<i># Velvet spine #</i>

26:22.870 --> 26:24.804
<i># Left for dead #</i>

26:24.872 --> 26:27.397
<i># Left for good #</i>

26:27.474 --> 26:29.465
Well, hello.

26:31.145 --> 26:34.205
- Are you okay?
- Don't be so annoying.

26:36.250 --> 26:40.550
So, um, you should come and check out
the club when it's all set up.

26:40.621 --> 26:42.555
You get V.I.P. treatment.

26:42.623 --> 26:45.854
You know, I can't say
I haven't thought about it.

27:38.111 --> 27:41.444
I got her! Yea!

28:05.038 --> 28:06.972
<i>This your brother?</i>

28:08.876 --> 28:10.810
Yeah.

28:14.147 --> 28:16.479
Where is he?

28:34.768 --> 28:39.671
<i>He's, uh- He's dead, probably.</i>

28:39.740 --> 28:41.537
How?

28:41.608 --> 28:45.009
He just disappeared.

28:47.714 --> 28:50.046
<i>Like Billy Moorcroft?</i>

28:51.184 --> 28:53.175
The police think
it could be the same guy.

28:55.188 --> 28:57.122
<i>You wanna see his room?</i>

29:00.561 --> 29:02.552
Sure.

29:20.614 --> 29:23.913
<i>Uh, hey, don't...</i>
<i>touch anything.</i>

29:23.984 --> 29:25.918
My dad'll freak.

29:33.527 --> 29:37.327
- What about your mom?
<i>- She bailed.</i>

29:41.101 --> 29:43.535
She was kind of a bitch anyway.

29:45.572 --> 29:49.064
If you want to
sit on the bed, you can.

29:49.142 --> 29:51.133
That's what the plastic's for.

29:57.284 --> 29:59.013
So what's it like in-

29:59.086 --> 30:02.112
- Virginia.
- Virginia.

30:02.189 --> 30:04.384
It sucks.

30:04.458 --> 30:08.417
It's like everybody knows
everything about me...

30:08.495 --> 30:12.522
but I'm invisible at the same time.

30:12.599 --> 30:14.866
So it's like
the worst of both worlds.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.434
Well, in high school...

30:17.502 --> 30:19.561
if you're not invisible,
you're an asshole.

30:19.638 --> 30:21.538
- Or a teacher.
- Or both.

30:29.848 --> 30:32.408
So you got brothers and sisters?

30:33.785 --> 30:35.776
A sister.

30:38.323 --> 30:40.257
Got married.

30:40.325 --> 30:42.486
Made tons of money,
made a new family.

30:43.628 --> 30:45.562
Never see her anymore.

30:45.630 --> 30:47.564
<i>Damn.</i>

30:49.968 --> 30:52.903
Sometimes it just feels like...

30:52.971 --> 30:55.838
- I could-
- Like what?

30:55.907 --> 30:59.070
I don't know.

30:59.144 --> 31:01.305
Sometimes I just wish I could...

31:03.915 --> 31:07.976
switch places
with someone, you know?

31:08.053 --> 31:10.578
That why you're goin'
to California-

31:11.957 --> 31:13.948
try and be somebody else?

31:15.694 --> 31:17.753
I always wanted to be a dancer...

31:19.464 --> 31:23.525
like in a troupe or something.

31:23.602 --> 31:27.504
You know, it probably
sounds kind of cheesy.

31:27.572 --> 31:29.665
<i>No. No.</i>

31:29.741 --> 31:31.936
So what about this club?

31:33.612 --> 31:36.308
Corey thinks we can work there.

31:36.381 --> 31:39.214
- Dancing?
- I guess.

31:45.490 --> 31:48.482
She givin' out a few freebies along the way?

31:48.560 --> 31:52.621
What, is that supposed to be, like, some kind
of a judgment or something?

31:52.697 --> 31:55.689
- Wait. No, no. I just-
- Where's the bathroom?

31:55.767 --> 31:57.792
- I-I didn't-
- This place is giving me the creeps.

31:57.869 --> 32:00.736
I didn't mean it like that.

32:39.845 --> 32:41.836
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

32:59.998 --> 33:01.932
Why me?

33:07.639 --> 33:09.630
I've done a lot of bad things.

33:10.675 --> 33:13.269
Do you want to do something else?

33:16.748 --> 33:19.945
I like it here, with you.

33:20.018 --> 33:21.918
Turn around.

33:21.987 --> 33:26.048
<i>The beginning of the end</i>
<i>starts here.</i>

33:29.628 --> 33:31.562
I don't wanna hurt anyone.

33:31.630 --> 33:34.428
<i>But they want to hurt you.</i>

33:53.919 --> 33:55.853
What's happening?

33:56.855 --> 33:58.789
Everything.

34:00.559 --> 34:03.084
Burn it to the ground.

34:44.069 --> 34:46.697
Hi. Are you planning
on checking out today?

34:46.771 --> 34:48.500
Uh-

34:48.572 --> 34:51.201
Well, you're already
two days behind, so-

34:51.275 --> 34:55.212
I gotta find my friend,
check on the car.

34:55.280 --> 34:58.078
Maybe you should go for the weekly rate,
save yourself some money.

34:58.149 --> 35:00.640
Thanks. Yeah.

35:00.719 --> 35:02.983
I'm very jealous, you know.

35:03.054 --> 35:05.022
Road-trippin' cross-country.

35:05.090 --> 35:09.049
Seein' America like Sal and Dean,
Thelma and Louise-

35:09.127 --> 35:11.391
<i>Easy Rider</i> style.

35:11.463 --> 35:15.695
- You know, bandits on the run. Yeah.
- Okay. Well, I-I gotta go.

35:15.767 --> 35:19.999
Okeydokey.
Oh, that's good though.

35:20.071 --> 35:24.508
Hey, did you ever hear about that island
where Elvis Presley and Jimi Hendrix...

35:24.576 --> 35:27.739
and, you know, uh,
Janis Joplin, they're all-

35:27.812 --> 35:29.746
They're not dead, you know?
Jim Morrison.

35:29.814 --> 35:32.009
They're all just there playin' music.
Have you heard of that?

35:50.702 --> 35:54.570
Must have melted from the heat.

35:54.639 --> 35:57.437
This church was made of brick...

35:59.010 --> 36:02.309
these crosses made of iron.

36:02.380 --> 36:04.940
You think a simple fire did this?

36:05.016 --> 36:07.246
What are you saying then, John?

36:07.318 --> 36:11.015
I'm saying there are forces
at work here.

36:11.089 --> 36:15.389
I feel it in my soul- something evil.

36:15.460 --> 36:17.985
Here we go.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.301
Son of a bitch.

36:33.378 --> 36:35.778
This town will crucify him.

36:44.723 --> 36:47.157
<i>I just can't believe it. I just-</i>

36:47.225 --> 36:49.159
I can't believe it's real.

36:49.227 --> 36:53.596
It's gonna be all right, Trudy.
You're gonna get through this.

36:53.665 --> 36:56.600
- Um, excuse me.
- Yes?

36:56.668 --> 36:59.637
Is everything okay?

36:59.704 --> 37:02.639
No. No, actually, it's not.

37:04.476 --> 37:07.536
Mount Calvary burned
to the ground last night.

37:07.612 --> 37:10.775
The police are investigating, but-

37:10.849 --> 37:12.783
I already know it's arson.

37:12.851 --> 37:16.446
- How do you know?
- Call it a feeling.

37:18.456 --> 37:22.017
- I have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
- Amen.

37:22.093 --> 37:24.027
Really?

37:25.964 --> 37:27.898
Mmm, what's he like?

37:27.966 --> 37:31.561
He's, um-

37:33.338 --> 37:35.272
He's big and strong.

37:36.407 --> 37:40.104
Tan, lots of muscles.

37:41.546 --> 37:45.642
And he's got lightning bolts
shooting out of his eyes.

37:45.717 --> 37:50.017
- No, really.
- It's true. He's awesome.

37:51.322 --> 37:53.256
He chose me.

37:53.324 --> 37:56.657
Conejo Springs
used to be a decent place.

37:58.096 --> 38:01.998
Then came the drugs and... anus sex.

38:03.902 --> 38:07.030
But each of us is responsible...

38:07.105 --> 38:09.437
to make a little change,
however we can.

38:10.975 --> 38:14.911
We need to get to the children
before they spoil.

38:17.749 --> 38:20.013
Oh. My bracelet.

38:25.690 --> 38:27.817
It's from John.

38:27.892 --> 38:30.087
He knows I love Jesus the most.

38:33.598 --> 38:36.362
Oh, hey.

38:36.434 --> 38:39.301
Somebody burned down the-
Somebody burned down the church.

38:39.370 --> 38:42.806
- I know.
- Yeah, it's pretty uncool, you know.

38:42.874 --> 38:45.274
Uh, Pastor John's a great guy.

38:45.343 --> 38:48.312
- Why?
- He went to prison.

38:48.379 --> 38:53.180
You know, he reinvented himself,
uh, started a new life.

38:53.251 --> 38:56.152
Helps kids with problems.

38:56.221 --> 38:58.519
I still- I still
never got your name.

38:59.724 --> 39:01.658
It's Sam.

39:01.726 --> 39:04.092
Jeremy. Jeremy Frame.

39:04.162 --> 39:06.722
Got it.

39:06.798 --> 39:10.928
- So, what are you up to?
- Um, trying to get money out.

39:11.002 --> 39:12.936
Kind of unsuccessfully.

39:13.004 --> 39:15.632
Oh, uh, still got that 20?

39:15.707 --> 39:17.902
I gave it to the motel.

39:17.976 --> 39:20.672
Well, you know, if you, um,
talk to Phil long enough...

39:20.745 --> 39:22.679
about U.F.O.'s,
he won't even charge you.

39:22.747 --> 39:24.715
Just don't say anything
about my meteorite.

39:24.782 --> 39:26.841
He's still pretty pissed
I got my hands on it first.

39:26.918 --> 39:30.513
Mmm. I- I think I'd rather pay.

39:30.588 --> 39:32.954
Are you leaving?

39:33.024 --> 39:35.219
- Thanks anyways.
- Oh. Yeah.

39:36.261 --> 39:38.320
Hi.

41:53.264 --> 41:57.462
- Hey. What happened to you last night?
- What happened to you?

41:57.535 --> 41:59.765
Passed out at Randy's.

42:01.305 --> 42:05.264
You should've stayed longer.
Want a beer?

42:05.343 --> 42:09.837
No. I want to get out of this place.
Did you find that water pump?

42:09.914 --> 42:13.008
Think so.
I haven't put it in yet.

42:13.084 --> 42:17.453
- Why not?
- Because we're having fun.

42:17.522 --> 42:20.116
Drinking warm beer
and dry-humping to Journey?

42:20.191 --> 42:22.091
Boo-yah.

42:22.160 --> 42:24.594
- Do you have something better to do?
- I thought we both did.

42:24.662 --> 42:26.596
Well, it really doesn't matter
what you think.

42:28.833 --> 42:31.597
You know, maybe I do have
better things to do.

42:31.669 --> 42:34.331
<i>What, like try to</i>
<i>off yourself again?</i>

42:39.510 --> 42:42.502
You can sleepwalk back to Virginia
for all I care.

42:48.686 --> 42:50.677
- You going after her?
- What?

42:50.755 --> 42:54.191
- Pretty harsh words.
- Says the small-town drunk.

42:54.258 --> 42:57.284
- Get out.
- Get the fuck out!

43:02.567 --> 43:05.058
Sam!

44:03.027 --> 44:06.326
<i> Well, you're a lucky girl-</i>
<i>got out of that car when you did.</i>

44:08.366 --> 44:10.926
<i>Could've been two dead today</i>
<i>instead of just one.</i>

44:14.138 --> 44:17.005
Now...

44:17.074 --> 44:19.907
you and I both know
that Randy had been drinkin'.

44:21.979 --> 44:24.777
But we also know
that he's not at fault here.

44:24.849 --> 44:26.817
How do you explain the car
that came out of nowhere?

44:26.884 --> 44:30.411
How do you explain midgets or sock monkeys?
I don't know.

44:31.656 --> 44:33.590
Shit happens.

44:35.626 --> 44:39.187
<i># Been running through</i>
<i>a battleground #</i>

44:39.263 --> 44:43.495
<i># My head was low</i>
<i>and my eyes stayed down #</i>

44:43.568 --> 44:45.297
<i># My pace was slow #</i>

44:45.369 --> 44:47.360
<i># Any chances it drowned #</i>

44:47.438 --> 44:50.669
<i># They were slim #</i>

44:50.741 --> 44:54.643
<i># Been sinking slowly</i>
<i>into the mire #</i>

44:54.712 --> 44:59.012
<i># Found myself lost</i>
<i>in enemy fire #</i>

44:59.083 --> 45:02.280
<i># I'm too young to be trapped</i>
<i>by the wire #</i>

45:02.353 --> 45:05.982
<i># That's within #</i>

45:08.359 --> 45:14.491
<i># I can't afford to dream</i>
<i>on the battleground #</i>

45:17.168 --> 45:24.199
<i># Nothing's left unseen</i>
<i>on the battleground ##</i>

45:36.287 --> 45:39.313
<i>There once was a unicorn named Ariel.</i>

45:39.390 --> 45:44.054
<i>Ariel was the most beautiful</i>
<i>unicorn in the world.</i>

45:44.128 --> 45:47.564
<i>Ariel was discovered</i>
<i>by a prince named Justin...</i>

45:47.632 --> 45:53.537
<i>and the prince was led into a world</i>
<i>of strange and beautiful magic.</i>

45:53.604 --> 45:57.005
<i>Nobody could see</i>
<i>how beautiful she was...</i>

45:57.074 --> 45:59.565
<i>because she was invisible-</i>

45:59.644 --> 46:02.374
<i>invisible to everyone except Justin.</i>

46:22.270 --> 46:25.068
<i>Wake up.</i>

46:30.512 --> 46:32.776
<i>Come closer.</i>

46:41.356 --> 46:43.347
<i>Closer.</i>

46:57.706 --> 47:01.039
- Why can't I touch you?
- 'Cause we'll explode.

47:01.109 --> 47:05.102
<i>You shouldn't be here.</i>
<i>Nobody should.</i>

47:05.180 --> 47:08.240
I just want Sam back.

47:11.052 --> 47:16.115
Sam is dead.
But you can find her.

47:26.201 --> 47:28.260
It's already begun.

47:28.336 --> 47:30.998
You don't have much time.

48:26.094 --> 48:28.790
I thought you'd be gone.

48:28.863 --> 48:31.491
Where?

48:36.404 --> 48:38.338
Anywhere.

48:42.677 --> 48:44.838
You, uh-You want a smoke?

49:01.329 --> 49:03.923
I am so fuckin' sorry.

49:05.266 --> 49:07.200
I know.

49:07.268 --> 49:10.362
I heard you signed the police report.

49:10.438 --> 49:14.704
Said I wasn't drinking. Why?

49:14.776 --> 49:17.870
Ruining your life won't bring Sam back,
would it?

49:17.946 --> 49:20.779
Make things right.

49:22.417 --> 49:24.351
You believe in spooky shit?

49:24.419 --> 49:27.411
- What, like Satan?
- Like ghosts.

49:27.489 --> 49:32.290
I don't <i>not</i> believe in them,
but I've never seen one.

49:34.029 --> 49:36.896
I said some pretty mean things
to Sam before she died.

49:40.101 --> 49:42.569
Think we're bad people?

49:43.671 --> 49:45.764
Not bad.

49:45.840 --> 49:47.774
I'd say medium.

49:52.881 --> 49:56.282
I'm sorry.

50:07.162 --> 50:10.791
I think I'm supposed
to find Billy Moorcroft.

50:10.865 --> 50:13.060
Find him where?

50:13.134 --> 50:16.467
I don't know, but I saw him.

50:18.540 --> 50:22.032
At the car accident.
At the motel.

50:22.110 --> 50:27.013
And it's like-
All I can think is it's just guilt.

50:27.082 --> 50:29.710
What did he say?

50:29.784 --> 50:33.242
I don't remember.
It's like I was trippin' or something.

50:33.321 --> 50:38.224
I got this acid one time-
this Flying Eagle Pyramid shit.

50:40.228 --> 50:42.719
I took two hits, and-

50:42.797 --> 50:46.733
There was this glowing grid
cutting through my brain, and-

50:46.801 --> 50:49.998
You know, I knew when it
got all the way through...

50:50.071 --> 50:52.266
that I'd just be, like,
this sketched-out vegetable.

50:54.976 --> 50:59.470
The whole time, my esophagus was
twisting and turning in my throat.

51:02.150 --> 51:04.880
I can slip back into it
now and again.

51:04.953 --> 51:07.945
But that's, like, a gift
and a curse.

51:08.022 --> 51:11.856
'Cause that means you gotta
figure out what's real and what's not.

51:13.161 --> 51:15.152
It's, like, you have to decide.

51:18.900 --> 51:22.734
Maybe this is all a nightmare
and we'll just wake up.

51:27.275 --> 51:29.869
I'd do anything
to take it all back...

51:29.944 --> 51:31.969
just start over.

51:32.046 --> 51:34.844
That's about as real as it gets.

51:34.916 --> 51:37.111
<i>There's gotta be some connection...</i>

51:37.185 --> 51:39.710
between what happened
to Sam and Donnie.

51:43.725 --> 51:45.659
That was Sam's brother?

51:46.828 --> 51:48.762
<i>She didn't mention him to me.</i>

51:48.830 --> 51:50.764
<i>Why would she?</i>

51:50.832 --> 51:55.326
I told her about me, about my brother.
I thought that she-

51:55.403 --> 51:58.167
She never talked
to anybody about it.

51:58.239 --> 52:00.400
What about her parents?

52:00.475 --> 52:03.569
<i>They treated her like she wasn't enough</i>
<i>for them to love.</i>

52:04.946 --> 52:08.074
<i>She told me she thought</i>
<i>her brother was the lucky one.</i>

52:09.484 --> 52:13.511
<i>Everyone would remember him</i>
<i>and love him forever.</i>

52:13.588 --> 52:16.182
Like he had the easy way out.

52:16.257 --> 52:18.987
You believe in second chances?

52:20.528 --> 52:23.258
I believe in "life sucks
and then you die."

52:37.312 --> 52:39.303
It's time.

52:45.954 --> 52:48.218
Bring your water.

53:09.210 --> 53:11.508
<i>Do you miss Sam?</i>

53:11.579 --> 53:13.513
Where is she?

53:13.581 --> 53:15.515
Do you miss her?

53:15.583 --> 53:17.778
Yes.

53:21.923 --> 53:23.891
Here it comes.

53:28.229 --> 53:31.062
<i>What would you do to get her back?</i>

53:32.567 --> 53:34.558
Anything.

53:59.761 --> 54:01.820
<i>You're almost there.</i>

54:01.896 --> 54:04.091
Inside?

54:10.138 --> 54:12.003
You have to go.

54:24.118 --> 54:27.144
<i>They won't let you do</i>
<i>whatever you want.</i>

54:31.859 --> 54:34.555
This is your last chance.

54:34.629 --> 54:36.654
Are you coming with me?

54:36.731 --> 54:39.029
That's impossible.

55:32.620 --> 55:35.589
I'd do anything to take it all back.

55:47.001 --> 55:48.935
<i>Just start over.</i>

56:19.834 --> 56:21.768
Hey.

56:21.836 --> 56:24.498
Hey. What happened to you?

56:24.572 --> 56:28.599
<i>You should've stayed longer.</i>
<i>Want a beer?</i>

56:28.676 --> 56:32.669
No. I want to get out of this place.
Did you find that water pump?

56:32.747 --> 56:35.477
Think so.
I haven't put it in yet.

56:37.919 --> 56:39.853
The motel guy came to the room
this morning.

56:39.921 --> 56:42.321
- I don't give a damn.
- Dude, we can't afford another day.

56:42.390 --> 56:45.655
I can't do this.

56:45.726 --> 56:47.887
What's wrong?

56:47.962 --> 56:50.226
I lied to you.

56:51.732 --> 56:54.292
My dad doesn't...
know we're here.

56:54.368 --> 56:57.064
He doesn't- He doesn't even
really know that I exist.

56:59.207 --> 57:01.141
So, what-what now?

57:02.410 --> 57:06.039
I don't know.
Maybe we get matching mullets...

57:06.113 --> 57:08.377
couple of tramp stamps.

57:08.449 --> 57:10.849
Put Randy in stud.

57:10.918 --> 57:14.684
Park here for a lifetime or so.

57:16.057 --> 57:19.049
Or...

57:19.126 --> 57:22.755
you can go and do something
totally fucking amazing.

57:22.830 --> 57:25.025
What about you?

57:28.636 --> 57:31.605
I got my own plans.

57:39.647 --> 57:42.013
We're so perfect.

57:43.251 --> 57:46.015
Immaculate.

58:42.043 --> 58:47.276
<i> # I've never seen you</i>
<i>when you're smiling #</i>

58:48.382 --> 58:54.218
<i># It really gets</i>
<i>under my skin #</i>

58:54.288 --> 59:00.420
<i># You say it's easy</i>
<i>when it's faster#</i>

59:00.494 --> 59:04.988
<i># I still can't guess</i>
<i>what you're after#</i>

59:05.066 --> 59:09.366
<i># It's the color of your skin #</i>

59:10.871 --> 59:16.138
<i># Your skin is black metallic #</i>

59:18.012 --> 59:22.949
<i># It's the color of your skin #</i>

59:24.452 --> 59:28.912
<i># Your skin is black metallic #</i>

59:31.158 --> 59:35.424
<i># Your skin is black metallic #</i>

59:37.465 --> 59:42.300
<i># Your skin is black metallic ##</i>

59:51.245 --> 59:53.179
Why did you show me this?

59:53.247 --> 59:55.807
<i> Do you want to know</i>
<i>what happens when you die?</i>

59:59.387 --> 01:00:01.719
Yes.

01:00:01.789 --> 01:00:06.658
You will. I died for you.
Will you do the same?

01:00:06.727 --> 01:00:09.525
Donnie liked to draw.

01:00:10.731 --> 01:00:12.665
It hurts.

01:00:12.733 --> 01:00:15.395
Remember the future.

01:00:16.604 --> 01:00:18.572
<i>You need to get to higher ground.</i>

01:01:15.023 --> 01:01:18.720
- You like it? We just got that in.
- You work here?

01:01:18.793 --> 01:01:20.727
My parents' store.

01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:26.296
<i>Hey. I-I'm really sorry about Corey.</i>

01:01:27.902 --> 01:01:30.427
I understand that you don't want
to talk about it, but I believe...

01:01:30.505 --> 01:01:32.439
that everything happens
for a reason...

01:01:32.507 --> 01:01:35.169
and-and I know
that for every action...

01:01:35.243 --> 01:01:38.872
- there is an equal and opposite reaction.
- I went to high school.

01:01:38.947 --> 01:01:41.472
Then you know that everything
is in constant motion.

01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:43.517
Like, right now,
the universe is expanding.

01:01:43.585 --> 01:01:45.951
And we're flying through space...

01:01:46.021 --> 01:01:49.980
at millions of miles per hour,
like a spaceship.

01:01:50.058 --> 01:01:53.755
And eventually it's just gonna grow so big
that it'll freeze and die...

01:01:53.828 --> 01:01:56.922
and then nothing we do
will matter at all.

01:01:56.998 --> 01:01:59.660
So Corey doesn't matter?

01:01:59.734 --> 01:02:03.830
No. She matters.
It's just-

01:02:03.905 --> 01:02:08.171
I believe everyone has something
that they're meant to do.

01:02:08.243 --> 01:02:11.269
Potential, or-or-or destiny.

01:02:11.346 --> 01:02:16.374
Like, I was destined to get my hands
on that meteorite.

01:02:16.451 --> 01:02:20.046
And it turns out that-that it's not even
a meteorite at all.

01:02:20.121 --> 01:02:24.956
It has this-this metal in it that doesn't
even exist on the periodic table.

01:02:25.026 --> 01:02:28.223
I think- I think
I'm gonna call it Framium.

01:02:28.296 --> 01:02:30.856
Like your last name?

01:02:30.932 --> 01:02:34.197
Everything's changing for me.

01:02:34.269 --> 01:02:38.501
I can see things that I only
used to dream about.

01:02:38.573 --> 01:02:41.235
What happened to your arm?

01:02:41.309 --> 01:02:45.268
It's, uh- It's just a rash.

01:02:50.185 --> 01:02:51.413
Sam.

01:02:54.889 --> 01:02:57.653
Is there anything I can do?

01:02:57.725 --> 01:02:59.955
Bring back my friend.

01:03:00.028 --> 01:03:01.996
Buy me that dress.

01:03:02.063 --> 01:03:05.055
I can't afford that.

01:03:05.133 --> 01:03:08.330
You can't bring back
my friend either, can you?

01:03:09.904 --> 01:03:11.394
No.

01:03:11.473 --> 01:03:15.239
Well, then what good are you?

01:03:21.149 --> 01:03:23.083
Sam, please.

01:03:23.151 --> 01:03:26.416
Hey. Get lost.

01:03:26.488 --> 01:03:28.456
You fucking kiddin' me?

01:04:19.674 --> 01:04:21.471
<i>Hey.</i>

01:04:21.543 --> 01:04:24.512
Surprised to see you here.

01:04:24.579 --> 01:04:28.811
I was just, um, returning your book.

01:04:28.883 --> 01:04:32.046
Oh. Do you wanna talk?

01:04:33.221 --> 01:04:35.155
About?

01:04:35.223 --> 01:04:38.659
How if I told you that God
could show you the way...

01:04:38.726 --> 01:04:41.957
- make sense of things?
- I don't think so.

01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:45.966
You know, he can find you too-
help jump-start your future.

01:04:47.235 --> 01:04:50.568
<i>I'd like to show you something.</i>
<i>What do you say?</i>

01:05:07.422 --> 01:05:09.356
Come on.

01:05:25.573 --> 01:05:28.701
Sometimes I like to just
come in here and sit...

01:05:28.776 --> 01:05:31.711
and just stare up at that screen...

01:05:31.779 --> 01:05:35.715
<i>and wait for God to show me</i>
<i>his plan for my life.</i>

01:05:39.087 --> 01:05:44.855
So, uh, you do a lot of drugs
when you were younger?

01:05:44.926 --> 01:05:47.895
Go ahead.

01:05:47.962 --> 01:05:49.827
You try it.

01:05:49.897 --> 01:05:54.732
Look up there on that screen
and try to visualize...

01:05:54.802 --> 01:05:58.238
what you think God's plan
for your life is.

01:05:58.306 --> 01:06:01.798
- You go first.
- Okay.

01:06:01.876 --> 01:06:05.243
<i>- What do you see?</i>

01:06:06.347 --> 01:06:09.145
<i>I see a light.</i>

01:06:11.386 --> 01:06:14.480
<i>A divine, guiding light.</i>

01:06:20.762 --> 01:06:24.755
So, what do you see for me?

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:28.034
Well, you have to look for yourself.

01:06:28.102 --> 01:06:31.037
<i>Go ahead. Picture-</i>

01:06:31.105 --> 01:06:35.872
<i>Picture what you think</i>
<i>God wants your life to be like.</i>

01:06:45.653 --> 01:06:48.053
So, what did you see?

01:06:49.357 --> 01:06:51.291
My childhood.

01:06:51.359 --> 01:06:54.817
- Oh, you can't go back.
- I thought it was my turn.

01:06:54.896 --> 01:07:00.801
Well, if you want to be born again,
you have to forget the past.

01:07:04.872 --> 01:07:07.136
Jeremy told me you were in prison.

01:07:09.410 --> 01:07:11.605
What did you do?

01:07:11.679 --> 01:07:15.376
Uh-

01:07:19.053 --> 01:07:22.045
That's not very...
important.

01:07:23.424 --> 01:07:28.361
Is that why you found God?
To save yourself?

01:07:29.697 --> 01:07:31.961
He found me.

01:07:35.002 --> 01:07:37.766
Do you know that...

01:07:37.839 --> 01:07:40.740
everything in the universe-

01:07:40.808 --> 01:07:43.299
everything- is God's will?

01:07:46.414 --> 01:07:50.009
- What about black holes?
- Everything.

01:07:50.084 --> 01:07:52.052
Dinosaurs?

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:54.054
- Everything.
- Herpes?

01:07:56.691 --> 01:08:00.684
You know, it's no coincidence that
you're here with me. You know that?

01:08:02.697 --> 01:08:05.530
<i>I have something for you.</i>

01:08:07.602 --> 01:08:09.797
A little bracelet.

01:08:09.871 --> 01:08:13.170
"W.W.J.D."

01:08:13.241 --> 01:08:15.835
<i>"What would Jesus do?"</i>

01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:18.504
<i>Here. Let me put it on your wrist.</i>

01:08:18.578 --> 01:08:21.309
It's okay.

01:08:21.381 --> 01:08:25.318
Just a friendly little reminder.

01:08:30.558 --> 01:08:33.993
You don't know how special
you are, do you?

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:37.827
See, I thought
you were gonna trust me.

01:08:39.634 --> 01:08:42.831
No. I changed my mind.

01:08:42.904 --> 01:08:46.738
Do you know that God
can change his mind too?

01:08:49.444 --> 01:08:52.174
Sam- Sam, listen to me.

01:08:52.246 --> 01:08:54.339
Where were you?

01:08:54.415 --> 01:08:57.179
We were supposed to raise money
for the church today. That was our plan.

01:08:57.251 --> 01:08:59.310
We-We were just talking.

01:08:59.386 --> 01:09:03.050
- Right, Sam? We were just talking.
- Yeah. Just-Just talking. Here.

01:09:04.524 --> 01:09:07.015
Good thing
sinners can repent, right?

01:09:10.465 --> 01:09:13.127
Trudy, nothing happened.

01:09:13.201 --> 01:09:15.692
I believe you.

01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:18.432
She made you do it.

01:09:18.506 --> 01:09:20.906
<i>I didn't do anything.</i>

01:09:20.975 --> 01:09:22.908
John, my bracelet's missing.

01:09:22.977 --> 01:09:25.309
Let's go.

01:10:07.321 --> 01:10:09.312
"When the manipulated awaken...

01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:12.484
"on their journey
to the tangent universe...

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:17.827
"they are often haunted
by the experience in their dreams.

01:10:17.899 --> 01:10:20.732
Many of them will not remember."

01:10:28.042 --> 01:10:31.068
Death comes to us all.

01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:44.551
<i>Here we come.</i>

01:10:46.193 --> 01:10:48.127
<i>Time to die.</i>

01:11:40.781 --> 01:11:42.715
Give it back to me.

01:11:47.154 --> 01:11:49.213
Why are you looking at me funny?

01:11:50.358 --> 01:11:52.292
Why are you looking funny?

01:11:55.363 --> 01:11:57.297
What happened to you?

01:11:59.934 --> 01:12:02.698
Grandma told me you would come.

01:12:02.770 --> 01:12:05.204
I don't know your grandma.

01:12:13.714 --> 01:12:15.909
What's your name?

01:12:15.983 --> 01:12:18.474
Justin Sparrow.

01:12:18.552 --> 01:12:20.884
Roberta Sparrow?

01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:24.817
Show me how to do it.

01:12:24.892 --> 01:12:27.122
I understand now.

01:12:27.194 --> 01:12:29.424
Sh-Show you what?

01:12:30.665 --> 01:12:33.657
You know, they found
your dog tags in the church.

01:12:33.734 --> 01:12:35.668
They said you burned it down.

01:12:40.441 --> 01:12:42.739
We had to get to higher ground.

01:12:44.679 --> 01:12:46.613
Look here.

01:12:54.155 --> 01:12:55.679
Wh-What's that?

01:12:55.756 --> 01:12:58.247
Your dream face.

01:12:58.325 --> 01:13:00.520
Just like you showed me.

01:13:00.594 --> 01:13:02.653
Donnie liked to draw.

01:13:02.730 --> 01:13:05.665
- How'd you know his name?
- You told me.

01:13:05.733 --> 01:13:07.462
When?

01:13:08.536 --> 01:13:10.299
When you were dead.

01:13:10.371 --> 01:13:13.204
I remember the future.

01:14:10.631 --> 01:14:12.963
Trudy?

01:14:15.069 --> 01:14:16.559
Hello?

01:15:59.672 --> 01:16:02.971
Burger, fries, Pepsi-
no tomato on the burger.

01:16:03.042 --> 01:16:05.033
- Please.
- Good goin', kiddo.

01:16:05.111 --> 01:16:07.841
And don't you worry.
They'll find him. They always do.

01:16:09.015 --> 01:16:11.882
- Who?
- Iraq Jack.

01:16:17.423 --> 01:16:20.392
You still mad at me?

01:16:21.461 --> 01:16:22.894
No.

01:16:22.962 --> 01:16:25.522
It wasn't my fault.

01:16:25.598 --> 01:16:27.828
The car came out of nowhere.

01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:29.834
I know.

01:16:41.614 --> 01:16:43.548
You saw my brother's bones?

01:16:46.119 --> 01:16:50.749
If you went up to that mine
a day earlier...

01:16:50.823 --> 01:16:53.724
might have found
Billy Moorcroft still alive.

01:16:56.562 --> 01:16:59.224
They say he probably suffered.

01:17:00.333 --> 01:17:02.494
I'm sorry.

01:17:02.568 --> 01:17:07.005
He just left him there...
to die.

01:17:07.073 --> 01:17:09.007
Cold and alone.

01:17:09.075 --> 01:17:12.044
They think Iraq Jack did it?

01:17:12.111 --> 01:17:14.579
- Yes, he did.
- Why?

01:17:14.647 --> 01:17:18.549
Found his stuff.
Right up above the mine.

01:17:18.618 --> 01:17:20.916
He didn't do it.

01:17:20.987 --> 01:17:24.013
Doesn't matter anymore.

01:17:24.090 --> 01:17:28.891
My brother, Corey, Billy-

01:17:28.961 --> 01:17:30.895
they're dead.

01:17:30.963 --> 01:17:32.897
That's it.

01:17:32.965 --> 01:17:35.957
I didn't tell you something before.

01:17:37.837 --> 01:17:40.328
My brother died too.

01:17:41.908 --> 01:17:44.274
I was 10.

01:17:44.344 --> 01:17:48.804
Ever since that day,
nothing's ever been the same.

01:17:48.881 --> 01:17:52.044
Never will be.

01:17:52.118 --> 01:17:54.712
We can't change that.

01:17:54.787 --> 01:17:57.085
Think it'll ever get easier?

01:17:57.156 --> 01:17:59.249
Probably get worse.

01:18:01.194 --> 01:18:03.856
- Maybe it's up to us.
- How?

01:18:05.031 --> 01:18:08.091
Wake up, start over.

01:18:09.369 --> 01:18:11.803
I wish I could believe that.

01:18:13.706 --> 01:18:17.073
We have the same holes
in our hearts...

01:18:17.143 --> 01:18:19.111
you and me.

01:18:34.193 --> 01:18:36.787
Show me how.

01:18:36.863 --> 01:18:38.922
Please show me how.

01:18:38.998 --> 01:18:41.125
- I'll show you how.
- No!

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.694
Three hours, 41 minutes
and 35 seconds.

01:18:45.772 --> 01:18:48.332
That's when the world will end.

01:19:02.522 --> 01:19:06.390
I'm sorry. I failed.

01:19:06.459 --> 01:19:10.156
But he didn't do it.
I told you everything.

01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:12.163
I spoke with Trudy myself.

01:19:12.231 --> 01:19:14.426
She's lying. It's hers.

01:19:16.536 --> 01:19:19.300
How dare you accuse me!

01:19:19.372 --> 01:19:22.239
This is my bracelet.

01:20:26.672 --> 01:20:28.697
What do you think?

01:20:32.612 --> 01:20:37.845
I think it's the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

01:20:42.522 --> 01:20:44.513
That can't be true.

01:20:47.126 --> 01:20:49.117
It is.

01:20:54.534 --> 01:20:57.901
<i>Well, uh, that's just the beginning.</i>

01:20:59.872 --> 01:21:02.841
I want you to come watch
the fireworks with me tonight.

01:21:05.211 --> 01:21:08.305
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on.

01:21:08.381 --> 01:21:11.475
It's gonna be beautiful.

01:21:11.551 --> 01:21:13.883
You don't want to miss it.

01:21:15.555 --> 01:21:19.252
I- I really don't know
if I'm up for it.

01:21:19.325 --> 01:21:22.852
You shouldn't be alone.
I mean, just-

01:21:22.929 --> 01:21:27.366
Go ahead. Try it on.
Huh?

01:21:54.393 --> 01:21:56.327
Why are we up here?

01:21:56.395 --> 01:21:58.329
This is the best spot.

01:21:59.599 --> 01:22:02.363
<i>I don't wanna be up here.</i>

01:22:02.435 --> 01:22:05.427
You look beautiful.
Come on.

01:22:08.574 --> 01:22:10.565
This is right where
the fireworks will come up.

01:22:15.281 --> 01:22:18.045
It'll be awesome.
You'll see.

01:22:22.955 --> 01:22:25.515
Just forget about everything.
You know, for one second.

01:22:26.525 --> 01:22:28.720
<i>Clear your mind.</i>

01:23:44.670 --> 01:23:46.661
Fucking duds!

01:23:52.912 --> 01:23:55.176
Did you see that?

01:23:55.247 --> 01:23:58.114
- What?
- This-

01:24:00.553 --> 01:24:04.319
<i>This is- This is impossible!</i>

01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:06.858
- What? The fireworks?
<i>- No.</i>

01:24:06.926 --> 01:24:10.293
The tesseracts.

01:24:16.335 --> 01:24:18.963
<i>What happened to you?</i>

01:24:19.038 --> 01:24:21.598
<i>That rash is gnarly.</i>

01:24:21.674 --> 01:24:25.838
Well- Is that all
you can think about?

01:24:25.911 --> 01:24:27.936
Look at the sky.

01:24:35.354 --> 01:24:37.515
They're coming.

01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:41.048
And there's only one person in the world
I wanna watch this with.

01:24:42.895 --> 01:24:46.160
Just one kiss. I really need this.

01:24:46.232 --> 01:24:49.463
Are you really that superficial?

01:24:49.535 --> 01:24:52.026
Or maybe-

01:24:52.104 --> 01:24:56.734
Maybe you're just a cock tease and you've
been stringing me along this whole time.

01:24:56.809 --> 01:25:00.267
Jeremy, you're creeping me out.

01:25:00.346 --> 01:25:03.679
- Maybe you could just calm down and-
- Calm down?

01:25:03.749 --> 01:25:06.377
Here's me being calm!

01:25:12.391 --> 01:25:14.689
Holy shit.

01:25:17.897 --> 01:25:21.833
If you could see...
what I see-

01:25:28.808 --> 01:25:30.901
<i>Sam?</i>

01:26:24.697 --> 01:26:27.962
Only you can save the universe.

01:26:41.714 --> 01:26:43.648
Sam?

01:26:44.650 --> 01:26:46.584
Sam!

01:28:49.908 --> 01:28:52.274
<i>Wake up. Start over.</i>

01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:22.436
<i>#Outside #</i>

01:29:22.508 --> 01:29:28.469
<i># The storm clouds gathering #</i>

01:29:30.549 --> 01:29:33.848
<i># Move silently along #</i>

01:29:33.919 --> 01:29:36.854
<i># The dusty #</i>

01:29:36.922 --> 01:29:41.222
<i># Boulevard #</i>

01:29:43.328 --> 01:29:47.958
<i># Where flowers</i>
<i>turn and crane #</i>

01:29:48.033 --> 01:29:56.168
<i># Their fragile necks #</i>

01:29:56.241 --> 01:30:01.112
<i># So they can in turn</i>
<i>reach up #</i>

01:30:02.047 --> 01:30:07.610
<i># And kiss the sky #</i>

01:30:07.686 --> 01:30:13.318
<i># They're driven</i>
<i>by a strange desire #</i>

01:30:20.432 --> 01:30:27.429
<i># Unseen by the human eye #</i>

01:30:28.907 --> 01:30:35.904
<i># Someone's calling #</i>

01:30:39.684 --> 01:30:43.051
<i># I remember when you held #</i>

01:30:43.121 --> 01:30:46.613
<i># My hand #</i>

01:30:46.691 --> 01:30:50.388
<i># Over here #</i>

01:30:50.462 --> 01:30:52.396
<i>You all right, Frank?</i>

01:30:52.464 --> 01:30:54.398
I don't believe this.

01:30:54.466 --> 01:30:58.562
<i> Sell this thing off to some</i>
<i>meteorological nerd club...</i>

01:30:58.637 --> 01:31:00.571
<i>you might just do okay.</i>

01:31:00.639 --> 01:31:02.732
What kind of a man
do you think I am...

01:31:02.807 --> 01:31:05.503
to try to make a buck
off another man's death?

01:31:07.245 --> 01:31:09.179
You oughta be ashamed of yourself...

01:31:09.247 --> 01:31:11.181
for even suggesting such a thing.

01:31:11.249 --> 01:31:16.312
<i># Someone's calling #</i>

01:31:21.359 --> 01:31:24.294
<i># The carnival #</i>

01:31:24.362 --> 01:31:29.163
<i># Is over#</i>

01:31:46.217 --> 01:31:49.277
So, how often does that bus come?

01:31:50.522 --> 01:31:51.784
Why?

01:31:53.191 --> 01:31:55.489
- I'm leaving.
<i>- What?</i>

01:31:59.297 --> 01:32:02.528
<i>We sat and watched...</i>

01:32:05.637 --> 01:32:08.197
<i>as the moon rose.</i>

01:32:13.878 --> 01:32:16.506
We're still perfect.

01:32:17.716 --> 01:32:19.308
Immaculate.

01:32:20.719 --> 01:32:23.187
You gonna be all right?

01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:37.834
Get out of here.

01:32:40.338 --> 01:32:42.272
Where you gonna go?

01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:45.867
- Virginia.
- What's that like?

01:32:46.945 --> 01:32:49.038
Sucks.

01:33:07.398 --> 01:33:11.334
<i>#Who'll ever win #</i>

01:33:11.402 --> 01:33:16.101
<i># Gee, you're just</i>
<i>so ephemeral #</i>

01:33:18.610 --> 01:33:20.942
<i># Go back for new #</i>

01:33:21.946 --> 01:33:26.440
<i># For new in vain</i>
<i>It failed #</i>

01:33:30.555 --> 01:33:35.254
<i># Singing on the famous street #</i>

01:33:35.326 --> 01:33:40.787
<i># I want to love, to love</i>
<i>to love, love me #</i>

01:33:40.865 --> 01:33:45.564
<i># Am I just in heaven</i>
<i>or Las Vegas #</i>

01:33:45.637 --> 01:33:50.904
<i># It's so much more brighter</i>
<i>than the sun is to me #</i>

01:33:50.975 --> 01:33:53.739
<i># He's a hustler#</i>

01:33:53.812 --> 01:33:58.476
<i># It's a role</i>
<i>He'll never make a suit #</i>
