WEBVTT

00:12.000 --> 00:14.412
Come on, guys.
MARILYN: She's wide open over here.

00:14.420 --> 00:15.990
WILMINGTON, DELAWARE

00:16.000 --> 00:19.618
There you go. Nice pass.

00:22.880 --> 00:23.995
Shoot

00:25.170 --> 00:28.207
Carmen, you just fouled
the halfback.

00:28.210 --> 00:29.416
You play like that tomorrow,

00:29.420 --> 00:32.036
we're going to get beat
by penalty kicks. Okay?

00:32.040 --> 00:34.497
I don't see why I can't go, Mom.

00:35.170 --> 00:37.456
I told you. We have a game tomorrow.

00:37.460 --> 00:39.496
So what? I'm not playing.

00:39.500 --> 00:43.243
You are still a member of this team
and they deserve your support.

00:43.250 --> 00:45.571
Then I'll get Dad to drive me
back in time for the game.

00:45.580 --> 00:49.323
No. Hey, come on, guys, pass the ball.

00:49.330 --> 00:52.117
Why? I want to spend time with Dad.

00:52.120 --> 00:55.704
Of course, you do.
He doesn't make you do anything.

00:55.710 --> 01:00.579
-God, you can be such a...
-Billie, you have a bad attitude.

01:02.080 --> 01:05.072
And I want it gone
by the time we head for home.

01:05.080 --> 01:09.665
I suggest you run it off. Laps. Now.

01:31.500 --> 01:34.071
Dad, where are you?

01:35.120 --> 01:38.203
Can you talk to Mom? Please.

01:38.210 --> 01:41.577
We're fighting, again.

01:41.580 --> 01:44.538
I really want to stay with you
for a little while.

01:44.540 --> 01:46.952
I know what you're going to say,

01:46.960 --> 01:50.612
but can we, at least,
have a family meeting?

01:50.620 --> 01:52.417
Call me back. Bye.

02:07.080 --> 02:11.779
Don't worry, mister.
If she's old, she can't go too far.

02:11.790 --> 02:15.578
I know what it's like to lose your dog.
Where'd you look?

02:18.330 --> 02:19.877
Are you okay?

02:34.500 --> 02:35.990
F.B.I, Behavioral Analysis Unity
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

02:36.000 --> 02:37.069
Yeah?

02:37.080 --> 02:39.617
Thank you for the flowers.

02:39.620 --> 02:44.876
"I know I can be challenging but
your work is appreciated. J. Gideon."

02:44.880 --> 02:48.998
I appreciate the appreciation
and, BTW, you're not challenging.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.410
Well, no, you're totally challenging

02:50.420 --> 02:53.492
but, you're not challenging at all
in a bad way, sir.

02:58.540 --> 03:01.452
Hey, is this your family?

03:01.460 --> 03:04.031
-Yeah, sort of.
-Nice.

03:06.830 --> 03:09.993
Thanks again for the flowers.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.410
-Hey.
-Hey.

03:13.170 --> 03:14.876
What the hell does "BTW" mean?

03:14.880 --> 03:19.078
Internet shorthand for "by the way,"
you sent Garcia flowers?

03:19.080 --> 03:20.160
No.

03:21.750 --> 03:22.910
You need something?

03:22.920 --> 03:24.876
Missing child in Wilmington, Delaware.

03:24.880 --> 03:28.031
11-year-old Billie Copeland
was last seen on the playground

03:28.040 --> 03:30.110
30 yesterday afternoon.

03:30.120 --> 03:33.669
That's 20 hours ago.
Child Abduction Response Plan

03:33.670 --> 03:35.285
says we get notified immediately.
What happened?

03:35.290 --> 03:37.611
Well, there was reason to believe
that she was with her father.

03:37.620 --> 03:38.871
Her cell phone shows a call to him

03:38.880 --> 03:40.199
at around the time
of the disappearance.

03:40.210 --> 03:41.609
So, they've since ruled him out?

03:41.620 --> 03:43.668
He called the mother
about an hour ago.

03:43.670 --> 03:45.114
That doesn't mean he isn't involved.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.497
He's on his way to the family home
so you can talk to him there.

03:47.500 --> 03:51.288
But, the local police are now
considering this a stranger abduction.

03:51.290 --> 03:52.450
20 hours late?

03:52.460 --> 03:55.611
Long-term stranger abductions
of children Billie's age are rare.

03:55.620 --> 03:59.738
They represent only half of one percent
of all missing cases per year,

03:59.750 --> 04:03.163
but they are usually more likely
to be fatal.

04:03.170 --> 04:04.740
Of the children
that are abducted and murdered,

04:04.750 --> 04:07.378
44% die within the first hour.

04:10.290 --> 04:14.499
From that point forth their odds of
survival greatly decrease.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.992
75% are gone after three hours.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.242
Virtually all of them are dead after 24.

04:21.790 --> 04:24.497
Which means we have
just under four hours to find her.

04:24.500 --> 04:25.740
Shall we go?

04:59.620 --> 05:01.918
The poet W. H. Auden wrote,

05:01.920 --> 05:06.323
"Evil is always unspectacular
and always human.

05:06.330 --> 05:09.743
"And shares our bed
and eats at our table."

05:14.880 --> 05:16.245
She's been missing 21 hours.

05:16.250 --> 05:17.877
We're going to go meet
with the lead detective

05:17.880 --> 05:19.245
at the park
where the girl was last seen.

05:19.250 --> 05:20.820
We need to know everything
that's being done.

05:20.830 --> 05:23.378
I'll find out what the press is running.
See if I know any of them.

05:23.380 --> 05:24.745
We may need to manage
what they put out.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.206
Good. See what the uniforms
know from the canvasses.

05:26.210 --> 05:27.416
-Elle.
-Yeah.

05:27.420 --> 05:29.160
I need you to be a liaison
with the family.

05:29.170 --> 05:30.319
A liaison?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.378
In a child abduction,
the parents are likely to break down

05:32.380 --> 05:34.666
-if we aren't careful.
-Okay.

05:36.540 --> 05:38.667
Put out a citywide alert.

05:38.670 --> 05:42.208
We've got multi-agency law
enforcement running canvass.

05:42.210 --> 05:46.249
Body and evidence grid search is up
and running on foot with canine units.

05:46.250 --> 05:47.615
Talked to the press twice,

05:47.620 --> 05:49.997
gave them a description
of the SUV and the suspect

05:50.000 --> 05:53.993
and formed a round-the—clock
volunteer-manned hotllne serwce.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.286
Did you run a background check
on these volunteers?

05:56.290 --> 05:58.611
Ongoing, but no red flags yet.

05:59.330 --> 06:00.991
I had to make a call on this one,
you know?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.070
It looked like a family thing.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.820
Any witnesses?

06:04.830 --> 06:07.287
Witnesses have her talking
to a white male,

06:07.290 --> 06:10.578
mid-305, carrying a leash,
right about there.

06:10.580 --> 06:12.821
-Just a leash -No dog.

06:12.830 --> 06:15.617
Lost dog is a common ruse.
Especially with children.

06:15.620 --> 06:19.454
A short time later, a green SUV
sped out of the parking lot over there.

06:19.460 --> 06:22.418
We have an Amber Alert on it.

06:22.420 --> 06:23.660
According to preliminary reports,

06:23.670 --> 06:25.820
mother and daughter had an argument
during soccer practice?

06:25.830 --> 06:28.993
Billie wants to spend more time with
her father. It's a pretty fresh divorce.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.662
I get the impression
that our victim is in the middle of it.

06:31.670 --> 06:33.570
UnSub could've been hunting
during practice.

06:33.580 --> 06:35.912
00 p.m.'s
a target-rich environment.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.377
Angry, upset little girl
needs someone to talk to.

06:38.380 --> 06:40.746
How would he know she was upset?

06:40.750 --> 06:43.571
Finding vulnerable kids
is what these guys are good at.

06:46.290 --> 06:48.952
Russet. Yeah. Where?

06:50.790 --> 06:52.701
We'll be right there.

06:53.290 --> 06:55.110
Uniforms just located another kid

06:55.120 --> 06:56.951
who might have talked
to the suspect yesterday.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.325
It's a couple of blocks from here.

06:58.330 --> 06:59.706
Let's go.

07:05.460 --> 07:09.749
Oh, my gosh. Guess what

07:09.750 --> 07:13.538
All my team-mates are so nice.
I'm so excited.

07:15.380 --> 07:18.611
Oh, Daddy, look a puppy. He's so cute.

07:18.620 --> 07:22.329
Oh, what a good boy.
Such a good boy.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.416
Where did he go?

07:24.420 --> 07:25.739
We're looking
for a white male in his 305

07:25.750 --> 07:26.876
who drives a late model, green SUV.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.490
Anyone who's seen
anything suspicious,

07:29.500 --> 07:32.617
we have a hotline set up
at the Wilmington Police Department.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.108
Billie Copeland is an 11-year-old girl.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.610
The last time she was seen,

07:36.620 --> 07:40.249
she was in a blue tracksuit
and a blue soccer uniform.

07:42.500 --> 07:46.994
They've been running that over
and over again for the past two hours.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.664
The press wants to talk to me,
but I just... I don't think I can face it.

07:52.580 --> 07:55.458
Why don't you just tell me
what happened?

07:56.210 --> 07:57.780
Umm...

07:58.290 --> 08:02.875
I was focused on practice.
And Billie was just

08:04.380 --> 08:07.031
being a pain, as usual.

08:07.040 --> 08:09.247
She was giving me attitude.

08:11.250 --> 08:13.536
So I told her to run it off.

08:15.040 --> 08:16.701
I sent her away.

08:23.330 --> 08:25.787
How long have you been divorced?

08:26.790 --> 08:28.872
It's been final for six months,

08:28.880 --> 08:32.031
but we haven't lived together
for over a year.

08:32.790 --> 08:34.781
You seeing anyone?

08:36.420 --> 08:40.789
Between work and Billie,
when would I have the time?

08:40.790 --> 08:44.612
Not one date

08:44.620 --> 08:49.990
I had a few casual dates after work,
but, they never came to the house.

08:51.540 --> 08:55.032
Billie still hopes that
her father and I will get back together.

08:55.040 --> 08:58.453
How did Billie's dog die,
Mrs. Copeland?

08:58.460 --> 09:02.954
He was hit by a car two weeks ago.
How did you know that?

09:02.960 --> 09:05.611
The shrine in the room.

09:05.620 --> 09:07.702
Helps her grieve?

09:07.710 --> 09:10.452
Her father did that for her.

09:10.460 --> 09:12.997
-They get along well?
-Best of friends.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.991
She calls him every night.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.322
Tells him about her day,
asks about his.

09:19.710 --> 09:22.031
He's a cancer survivor.

09:22.040 --> 09:24.452
So, he takes time off from work,

09:24.460 --> 09:28.578
pulls her out of school
for father-daughter field trips.

09:28.580 --> 09:31.492
Says we all need to stop and enjoy life.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.877
But he forgets
that he has responsibilities.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.371
That they both do.

09:37.380 --> 09:40.167
Which makes me the bad guy.

09:40.170 --> 09:43.822
And she blames me for the divorce.

09:43.830 --> 09:45.957
Blames me for everything.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.913
I should have just let her go
with her father.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.319
I'm sorry.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.115
She's pretty fragile.

10:01.120 --> 10:03.918
The last thing she did
was fight with her daughter.

10:03.920 --> 10:06.707
Can you imagine what that feels like?

10:14.620 --> 10:16.247
Mr. Copeland's here.

10:18.380 --> 10:21.110
Yeah.

10:21.120 --> 10:26.285
-My friends in the press, eat this up.
-They have a lot of on-air hours to fill.

10:29.500 --> 10:30.910
Excuse me.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.666
Look who's here.

10:35.380 --> 10:36.950
Came all the way down
from New York, huh?

10:36.960 --> 10:39.246
Well, missing little girl
is always going to be news.

10:39.250 --> 10:40.376
Yeah.

10:40.380 --> 10:43.372
So did you get all the photos
and everything you need?

10:43.380 --> 10:45.575
Look, she's been missing
since yesterday.

10:45.580 --> 10:48.037
How come you guys just got here?

10:48.040 --> 10:49.610
We'll have a press conference.

10:49.620 --> 10:51.326
-When?
-Soon.

10:52.250 --> 10:55.458
Come on, J].
Give me something. Huh?

10:55.460 --> 10:58.918
-For old times' sake?
-Okay.

11:02.380 --> 11:04.917
You may want to rethink that tie.

11:10.120 --> 11:12.247
I have been calling you all night.

11:12.250 --> 11:14.320
I'm sorry, Marilyn.
I turned my phone off.

11:14.330 --> 11:18.494
How could you turn your phone off?
What if Billie got sick or...

11:20.120 --> 11:23.374
-We needed you.
-I said I was sorry.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.609
What's being done
to find my daughter?

11:36.620 --> 11:39.612
-We're assessing that right now.
-She's been missing since yesterday.

11:39.620 --> 11:41.668
What the hell have you people
been doing since then?

11:41.670 --> 11:43.956
-Where have you been, Mr. Copeland

11:43.960 --> 11:48.283
-Where were you all day and all night?
-I have a cabin in BrandwNine Valley.

11:48.290 --> 11:52.499
-Police tried you there.
-Well, maybe I was out at the time.

11:52.500 --> 11:55.207
Billie tried your cell phone
yesterday afternoon.

11:55.210 --> 11:58.532
Well, I shut it off sometimes.
I like the solitude.

11:58.540 --> 12:01.202
You didn't fight your wife
for custody of your daughter,

12:01.210 --> 12:03.701
but you, you like being in her life.

12:03.710 --> 12:07.669
I want her to grow up in her home.
With her friends around.

12:07.670 --> 12:09.615
This is the only place she's ever lived.

12:09.620 --> 12:12.282
-So, you love her very much.
-Yes.

12:12.290 --> 12:15.669
Why are you wasting the precious time
we have left?

12:15.670 --> 12:20.698
You weren't at your cabin.
You weren't at work or with friends.

12:20.710 --> 12:22.666
The police didn't call us
until a little while ago

12:22.670 --> 12:24.911
because they thought your daughter
might have been with you.

12:24.920 --> 12:27.741
That you might have taken
your daughter.

12:29.580 --> 12:33.914
Until you can give us a satisfactory
accounting of your whereabouts

12:33.920 --> 12:36.491
from the time _ _
your daughter went missmg until...

12:36.500 --> 12:39.708
Why don't you help me understand

12:39.710 --> 12:42.076
why a devoted father
who talks to his daughter every night

12:42.080 --> 12:46.244
suddenly turns his phone off
and disappears for almost 24 hours.

12:47.380 --> 12:49.610
I was busy.

12:51.670 --> 12:52.876
30.

12:52.880 --> 12:56.202
30
and found out Billie was missing.

12:56.210 --> 12:57.450
So?

12:57.460 --> 12:59.246
Well, Brandywine Valley's
15 minutes away.

12:59.250 --> 13:02.037
Where were you, Mr. Copeland?

13:02.040 --> 13:03.871
I don't...

13:07.040 --> 13:11.534
I was at Sloane Kettering Hospital
in New York City.

13:11.540 --> 13:15.749
Dr. Baylan Mahal.
He's the Head of Oncology.

13:15.750 --> 13:18.958
-You can call him if you want.
-I will.

13:25.710 --> 13:28.952
-You had a relapse?
-It's in my lymph nodes now.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.701
There's nothing more they can...

13:39.620 --> 13:43.738
Please find my daughter.
Find my daughter.

13:53.210 --> 13:55.166
Call Sloane Kettering.

14:10.380 --> 14:13.281
Good afternoon. I'm Detective Russet.

14:13.290 --> 14:15.918
This is Special Agents Hotchner
and Morgan from the FBI.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.787
-Hi, you guys.
-Can I see your gun?

14:18.790 --> 14:21.372
This used to be a good neighborhood.

14:21.380 --> 14:22.529
But this is what happens

14:22.540 --> 14:25.202
when you let pedophiles and
sex freaks live wherever they want.

14:25.210 --> 14:26.575
-Ma'am, we...
-No, I have been searching

14:26.580 --> 14:29.743
the sex offender registry.
Two of them live close.

14:29.750 --> 14:32.958
Not that you can tell exactly
where from the map on the Internet.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.996
-Are you talking to them?
-Yes, ma'am.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.911
What's a pedophile sex freak?

14:36.920 --> 14:39.536
Okay, hey, hey, kids, kids, listen up.

14:39.540 --> 14:43.283
Which one of you is Connie?
Hey, sweetheart.

14:43.290 --> 14:44.951
Ma'am,
do you mind if we ask your daughter

14:44.960 --> 14:46.951
-just a couple of questions?
-No.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.166
Why don't we step right over here

14:48.170 --> 14:51.788
and the rest of you
can go back to playing, all right?

14:52.790 --> 14:54.075
He's going to
ask you some questions.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.411
All right.

14:55.420 --> 14:57.877
Connie, I'm Agent Hotchner.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.576
Did you talk to a man yesterday
about finding his dog?

15:00.580 --> 15:04.243
Yeah, he said her name was Candy
and that she was old.

15:04.250 --> 15:08.118
But I told him I couldn't help him 'cause
I had to go home and have lunch.

15:08.120 --> 15:10.327
And if I'm late, I get grounded.

15:10.330 --> 15:11.991
Yeah, well, moms are like that.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.663
And then when he came back,
I was already late for soccer practice.

15:15.670 --> 15:18.321
-Connie, he came back?
-Yeah, after lunch.

15:18.330 --> 15:20.116
He said his dog was still lost.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.532
Do you think you'd recognize him
if you saw him again?

15:22.540 --> 15:23.871
I don't know.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.495
Would you like to go down
to the police department

15:25.500 --> 15:27.320
and have a look at a book
with some men's faces in it?

15:27.330 --> 15:28.570
Might help you recognize him?

15:28.580 --> 15:30.707
-Would that be all right?
-Okay.

15:30.710 --> 15:31.916
Okay.

15:33.380 --> 15:34.995
Thanks, Connie.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.161
He came back to the same
neighborhood twice in one day.

15:40.170 --> 15:42.377
-That's bold.
-He's comfortable in the area.

15:42.380 --> 15:43.574
Yeah.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.411
What do we know?

15:49.420 --> 15:51.411
We talked to a kid
who had contact with the UnSub.

15:51.420 --> 15:53.206
He came back to the same street
more than once.

15:53.210 --> 15:54.666
That tells us
he's at ease in the neighborhood

15:54.670 --> 15:56.319
and comfortable talking to kids
in plain view.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.321
He lured Billie with a story
about a lost dog.

15:58.330 --> 16:00.286
Yeah, she recently lost one of her own.

16:00.290 --> 16:01.951
That indicates previous knowledge
of the victim.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.372
Yeah, but it doesn't mean
she necessarily knew him personally,

16:04.380 --> 16:05.495
only that he's aware.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.661
It's not uncommon
for predators like these

16:07.670 --> 16:09.570
to know kids that live around his area.

16:09.580 --> 16:10.956
He's from the neighborhood.

16:10.960 --> 16:13.246
Then we go door-to-door
and ask for voluntary searches.

16:13.250 --> 16:16.208
The neighborhood's already crawling
with uniforms. They're everywhere.

16:16.210 --> 16:18.030
Look, so far, you've followed

16:18.040 --> 16:20.076
the Child Abduction Response Plan
to the letter?

16:20.080 --> 16:21.741
For the past few hours. Yes.

16:21.750 --> 16:24.457
So now we need to
move past the gUIdeIInes.

16:24.460 --> 16:25.779
What?
-Change tactics.

16:25.790 --> 16:30.489
If we don't, Billie isn't going to make it
past the next 24 hours.

16:30.500 --> 16:31.706
I want you to corral these clowns.

16:31.710 --> 16:34.076
We're going to need them. All of them.

16:39.580 --> 16:43.243
Billie Copeland
has been missing 22 hours.

16:43.250 --> 16:48.324
It is vital
that we locate her in the first 24.

16:48.330 --> 16:50.662
The unknown subject
in this case is most likely a resident

16:50.670 --> 16:52.661
of one of the subdivisions
around the park.

16:52.670 --> 16:54.035
We have canceled the AMBER Alert.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.530
We need to coordinate
WIth all your officers

16:55.540 --> 16:56.996
to pull everyone off
the street immediately.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.240
-That's crazy.
-Just hear me out.

16:58.250 --> 17:01.617
But it goes against CARP procedures.
You guys wrote the damn thing.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.953
CARP is just a guideline for immediate
response to child abduction.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.996
Believe it or not,
we're already late in the game

17:07.000 --> 17:08.786
and we do know enough about
this UnSub to know that

17:08.790 --> 17:10.530
if he feels like_
we are closmg In on hIm at all,

17:10.540 --> 17:12.371
he will kill Billie to avoid detection.

17:12.380 --> 17:15.372
If anything,
we need to lessen the pressure on him.

17:15.380 --> 17:19.328
The man fits in
'cause nobody knows what he is.

17:19.330 --> 17:21.878
Can we really know our neighbors?

17:22.540 --> 17:23.780
He walks his dog.

17:23.790 --> 17:25.530
-Good morning.
-Hi.

17:26.790 --> 17:30.874
Does yard work.
Solitary activities appeal to him.

17:31.500 --> 17:32.910
But if you watch closely, you'll see

17:32.920 --> 17:36.708
that he pays a little too much attention
to the neighborhood kids.

17:41.080 --> 17:44.914
This largely goes unnoticed
because he isn't perceived as a threat.

17:44.920 --> 17:48.378
He's a white male,
in his late 205 to 305.

17:48.380 --> 17:50.530
He has a menial or temporary job.

17:50.540 --> 17:52.280
Socially marginalized and frustrated,

17:52.290 --> 17:54.781
he relates better to kids
than he does to adults.

17:54.790 --> 17:58.783
This is not his first offense against
children, but it is his first abduction.

17:58.790 --> 17:59.916
How do you know that?

17:59.920 --> 18:04.323
Well, first timers hunt close to home.
Experienced predators don't.

18:04.330 --> 18:08.118
And he's had a recent stressor,
a job loss or other setback.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.826
Unable to maintain
a normal relationship,

18:09.830 --> 18:11.661
_ herhave_ _
extenswe pornographic materials

18:11.670 --> 18:13.240
in his home and on his computer.

18:13.250 --> 18:17.072
And while they won't all involve
children, some of them definitely will.

18:17.080 --> 18:18.741
Since he used a missing dog ruse

18:18.750 --> 18:21.492
and we believe him to be
a regular fixture of the neighborhood,

18:21.500 --> 18:23.661
it's quite possible
that he truly does own

18:23.670 --> 18:25.820
or did at one point
own a dog named Candy.

18:25.830 --> 18:28.412
We'd recommend
crosschecklng any veterinary records

18:28.420 --> 18:30.240
with residents in the neighborhood.

18:30.250 --> 18:32.571
He will not inject himself
into this investigation.

18:32.580 --> 18:34.536
Don't these guys like to know
what the cops know?

18:34.540 --> 18:37.418
No, not this type of UnSub.
He's hiding.

18:37.420 --> 18:38.819
He doesn't know what anyone saw.

18:38.830 --> 18:42.869
_ He doesn't know if_there's
any Information about hIm out there.

18:42.880 --> 18:48.034
He's not likely to walk in and ask us,
"Can I help you?"

18:48.040 --> 18:51.168
But I can guarantee you
he will be watching the news.

18:51.170 --> 18:53.115
So how we handle them
IS very Important.

18:53.120 --> 18:54.246
Check your canvass records.

18:54.250 --> 18:56.662
One of you may have had contact
with him in the early stages.

18:56.670 --> 18:58.160
What about registered sex offenders?

18:58.170 --> 19:00.070
We've got somebody working
on that right now.

19:00.080 --> 19:02.787
Okay, ladies and gentlemen.
Everyone clear on that?

19:02.790 --> 19:04.701
Good luck. Thank you.

19:05.670 --> 19:09.822
Penelope Garcia's house of
"how may I save your ass today?"

19:09.830 --> 19:12.572
Girl, you can give me sex offender
registry for Wilmington, Delaware.

19:12.580 --> 19:14.070
Oh, that's always a fun group.

19:14.080 --> 19:18.915
Morgan, did you hear
that Agent Gideon sent me flowers?

19:18.920 --> 19:21.320
-No kidding

19:22.710 --> 19:25.281
-Sex offenders, Garcia.
-All right.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.206
Wilmington, Delaware, sex offenders.

19:29.210 --> 19:32.327
Worst of them all,
Level Three offenders, zip, nada.

19:32.330 --> 19:35.538
Got a couple of Level Two's
residing six and twelve miles

19:35.540 --> 19:37.201
from the abduction site.

19:37.210 --> 19:42.079
One of which with such a long sheet,
he should probably still be in prison,

19:42.080 --> 19:44.822
but apparently
has served his full freight,

19:44.830 --> 19:48.948
and another paroled on two counts
of sexual assault and rape one.

19:48.960 --> 19:51.781
-Any child victims?-No.

19:51.790 --> 19:53.951
Come on, Garcia. Dig. Dig for me.

19:56.880 --> 19:59.496
You've got a Level One,
Dennis Jones lives a mile away.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.161
"Solicitation of Prostitution."

20:01.170 --> 20:03.286
No, Jones doesn't fit the profile.

20:03.290 --> 20:06.373
The guy we're looking for probably
couldn't perform with adults, pro or not.

20:06.380 --> 20:09.281
Well, give me a list of suspects
and I can run a deep background.

20:09.290 --> 20:11.451
No. It'll be way too late by then.

20:12.210 --> 20:15.577
You took all the police off the street?

20:15.580 --> 20:18.242
We believe your daughter was
abducted by someone in the area

20:18.250 --> 20:20.707
and that she's probably still nearby.

20:20.710 --> 20:24.032
Then shouldn't you be
flooding the area with cops?

20:24.040 --> 20:26.031
-Knocking on doors?
-It's not that simple.

20:26.040 --> 20:28.110
Yes, it is.

20:28.120 --> 20:31.112
You're taking the meds again.

20:31.120 --> 20:35.910
Look, what exactly are you people
doing to help get my daughter back?

20:35.920 --> 20:38.741
You're sick again, aren't you?

20:38.750 --> 20:42.663
We want you to meet with the press.
Both of you.

20:42.670 --> 20:45.571
A press conference

20:45.580 --> 20:48.708
You just said you're already taking
the press that's running off the air.

20:48.710 --> 20:53.534
I know but this will be different.

20:53.540 --> 20:55.667
Trust us, Mr. Copeland.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.951
I'll get it.

20:58.960 --> 21:01.827
Just tell Marilyn
what you need us to do.

21:05.210 --> 21:08.452
-That was his second remission.
-I'm sorry.

21:08.460 --> 21:10.746
Billie won't even talk to me any more.

21:10.750 --> 21:13.537
How am I going to tell her
that her father's sick again?

21:13.540 --> 21:15.781
One thing at a time, Mrs. Copeland.

21:15.790 --> 21:18.497
Once we find your daughter,
you'll figure it out.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.785
Yeah, can I help you?

21:19.790 --> 21:21.917
Mr. Copeland. I'm Helen
Godfrey from a few blocks away.

21:21.920 --> 21:24.320
I have printouts on all sex offenders
in the area.

21:24.330 --> 21:28.118
I mean, I think it would be...
Look at any of these.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.701
What the hell?

21:32.040 --> 21:35.203
Mr. Copeland? Mr. Copeland!

21:42.670 --> 21:46.242
There are sex offenders in the area.
I thought he should know.

21:46.250 --> 21:47.535
Stupid.

21:49.830 --> 21:51.957
Hotch, we have a problem.

22:15.080 --> 22:16.570
Dennis Jones?

22:17.710 --> 22:20.076
Are you Dennis Jones?

22:20.080 --> 22:22.878
-Do I know you

22:22.880 --> 22:24.074
What?

22:25.170 --> 22:27.877
You tell me where she is
or I'm gomg to kIll you rIght here.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.610
Dude, I got no idea
what you're talking about.

22:30.620 --> 22:32.167
Where is she?

22:35.040 --> 22:37.668
Tell me where is she, you pervert!
Tell me.

22:39.250 --> 22:41.912
Copeland. Mr. Copeland, don't do it.

22:43.710 --> 22:45.246
Get off of me!

22:46.580 --> 22:48.787
-He's got my kid!
-I got no kid!

22:49.830 --> 22:51.070
Get inside.

22:51.080 --> 22:53.162
-What _is this?
-Let It go.

22:53.170 --> 22:56.822
He's got my daughter.
I know he does.

23:08.420 --> 23:12.072
Well, that's it. No more uniforms
in the neighborhood.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.458
-Are you sure this is the way to go?
-I hope it is.

23:17.920 --> 23:21.321
You're taking a hell of a chance,
aren't you?

23:21.330 --> 23:25.539
All we can do is respond
to what's in front of us.

23:25.540 --> 23:27.610
What if you're wrong?

23:30.080 --> 23:32.457
Do you know what program
did the most harm to this country

23:32.460 --> 23:34.371
in terms of crimes like this?

23:34.380 --> 23:36.075
-Child abduction.
-No.

23:36.080 --> 23:38.992
-"Stranger Danger."
-Flooded the schools with it.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.740
I_ remember them
coming to my classroom.

23:40.750 --> 23:44.789
It was "Officer Friendly" with
"Stranger Danger" coloring books.

23:44.790 --> 23:45.916
Taught a whole generation

23:45.920 --> 23:49.208
about a scary man in a trench coat
hiding behind a tree.

23:49.210 --> 23:52.998
Then we learnt that strangers
are only a fraction

23:53.000 --> 23:54.956
of the offenders out there.

23:54.960 --> 23:57.167
Most are people you see every day.

23:57.170 --> 24:00.571
Your family, your neighbors,
your school teachers.

24:02.380 --> 24:04.029
You know the rest.

24:04.040 --> 24:05.826
Prepared our children for 1%
of the danger

24:05.830 --> 24:08.162
and made them more vulnerable
to 99%.

24:08.170 --> 24:09.376
So we've been wrong before.

24:09.380 --> 24:12.281
All we can do is learn from _it
and hopefully be better next time.

24:12.290 --> 24:15.248
Unit five-three-nine.-Nine.

24:15.250 --> 24:17.457
Nine, we have a marked unit
calling for your presence

24:17.460 --> 24:19.781
at the river off Route Six.

24:19.790 --> 24:23.829
-What's this in reference to?-They've located a body. Female.

24:28.790 --> 24:29.950
The call was anonymous.

24:31.170 --> 24:34.321
Said there was a body in the water.

24:34.330 --> 24:37.288
Brown hair, brown eyes.
About 4'10", 4'11"?

24:37.290 --> 24:38.496
Yeah.

24:39.960 --> 24:41.916
I should have
started this search earlier.

24:41.920 --> 24:45.879
I'm sure you just did
what you thought was right, Detective.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.492
-I can't, I can't. If it's her I...
-It's all right.

25:43.040 --> 25:45.611
Mr_. Jones isn't interested
In pressmg charges.

25:45.620 --> 25:48.202
Oh, oh, am I supposed to be grateful?
The bastard's a pedophile.

25:48.210 --> 25:50.246
-No, he isn't.
-Did you check up on him?

25:50.250 --> 25:51.410
Did you even search his house?

25:51.420 --> 25:53.456
Hi_s _s_ex offense_
was so|ICItIng a prostItute.

25:53.460 --> 25:55.246
It had nothing to do with children.

25:55.250 --> 25:57.036
-But he's registered on...
-Mr. Copeland.

25:57.040 --> 25:58.780
There are a lot of ways
to get on that list.

25:58.790 --> 26:00.451
That's why accessing
that type of information

26:00.460 --> 26:03.111
is supposed to be left up
to law enforcement.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.452
We understand
your frustratIon and your anger,

26:05.460 --> 26:08.497
but you're jeopardizing our efforts
to save your daughter's life.

26:08.500 --> 26:11.788
Every minute spent chasing you
is time we're not spending on Billie.

26:11.790 --> 26:14.327
So, either get control of yourself
and follow our directions

26:14.330 --> 26:16.378
or stay out of our way.

26:19.790 --> 26:21.280
What would you like us to do?

26:21.290 --> 26:23.326
Make a public appeal for information

26:23.330 --> 26:26.993
regarding a witness
driving a dark green SUV.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.820
Isn't he supposed to be the suspect?

26:28.830 --> 26:30.661
Yes, but when people hear "suspect,"

26:30.670 --> 26:33.321
they can't see the guy next door
as a monster.

26:33.330 --> 26:35.878
They can't imagine their neighbor
could do something like this.

26:35.880 --> 26:38.246
If he's a witness, he might be a hero.

26:38.250 --> 26:40.320
Okay, but what if he thinks it's a trick?

26:40.330 --> 26:43.493
What if he panics or thinks it's too rislq
and then he...

26:43.500 --> 26:45.957
It's not just him
that you'll be speaking to.

26:45.960 --> 26:47.700
It's his neighbors as well.

26:47.710 --> 26:50.611
We've done everything we can
to relieve the pressure on this man.

26:50.620 --> 26:52.110
We've taken the cops off the street.

26:52.120 --> 26:54.532
You won't have any standing with you
on the dais.

26:54.540 --> 26:56.030
Only a local minister.

26:56.040 --> 26:58.201
Hearing he isn't a suspect
might calm him down as well.

26:58.210 --> 27:00.451
Right now he's under enormous stress.

27:00.460 --> 27:01.575
And we need him to believe,

27:01.580 --> 27:03.821
even if it's just for a little while,
that we're way off the mark.

27:03.830 --> 27:06.458
That we're not close to arresting him.

27:06.460 --> 27:09.611
Are you

27:10.830 --> 27:12.991
We need the public's help.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.991
Okay, come on.
MALE REPORTER: Here they come.

27:22.420 --> 27:25.321
Would you just close the door?
Thank you.

27:26.120 --> 27:28.111
Okay, can I have everyone's attention?

27:28.120 --> 27:31.704
Please, if you could just take
your seats, I'll begin.

27:33.250 --> 27:35.992
The Copeland family
is here to make an appeal.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.206
As you all know,

27:37.210 --> 27:39.667
their 11-year-old daughter, Billie,
is missing.

27:39.670 --> 27:43.379
So if you could just have
a little compassion and patience.

27:43.380 --> 27:44.870
Mr. Copeland.

27:48.500 --> 27:53.324
00 p.m.,

27:53.330 --> 27:58.745
my daughter, our daughter,
Belinda Copeland, Billie,

27:58.750 --> 28:01.207
went missing
from the recreation center.

28:01.210 --> 28:05.909
We are looking for a man,
a witness in a green SUV.

28:05.920 --> 28:09.822
There have been some reports that
he is a suspect but that was a mistake.

28:09.830 --> 28:12.913
He is not suspected of anything.

28:12.920 --> 28:17.459
We would like this man to come
forward and tell us what he knows.

28:17.460 --> 28:19.416
We need your help.

28:19.420 --> 28:23.709
He may not even understand
how important what he saw is.

28:23.710 --> 28:28.613
So, anyone with information about
this individual or his green SUV,

28:28.620 --> 28:30.918
please call the tip hotline.

28:32.170 --> 28:33.410
Thank you.

28:33.420 --> 28:36.116
Mr. Copeland.
Mr. Copeland!

28:36.120 --> 28:40.204
We'd like Billie to come home, now.
It'll be dark soon. Thank you.

28:40.210 --> 28:43.247
So the body located by police,
earlier today, is not Billie's?

28:43.250 --> 28:44.410
What?

28:44.420 --> 28:45.819
The female body
that was found in the water.

28:45.830 --> 28:47.286
There'll be no more questions.
Thank you.

28:47.290 --> 28:49.531
This press conference is over.

28:51.170 --> 28:52.535
What body?

28:52.540 --> 28:55.373
There'll be no more questions.
That'll be all for now.

28:55.380 --> 28:58.668
Mr. Copeland, when was
the last time you saw your daughter?

28:58.670 --> 28:59.819
Mr. Copeland!

29:02.500 --> 29:05.071
-Is that your idea of compassion?
-I only asked a question.

29:05.080 --> 29:07.207
You're the ones who didn't tell
the parents about the body.

29:07.210 --> 29:09.417
A positive identification
hasn't been made.

29:09.420 --> 29:11.991
Asking them about that
was out of line, Hal.

29:16.670 --> 29:19.207
-Is there a body?
-Please just come with me.

29:19.210 --> 29:22.077
You tell me right now!
Did you find a body?

29:22.080 --> 29:23.206
Mrs. Copeland.

29:23.210 --> 29:25.826
Did you find Billie

29:25.830 --> 29:29.493
-A body was discovered.
-It's not Billie.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.070
The body that was found
was much older.

29:31.080 --> 29:32.456
It has been dead for a number of days.

29:32.460 --> 29:34.701
It looks like maybe a junkie
or an overdose.

29:34.710 --> 29:36.575
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I saw the body myself.

29:36.580 --> 29:40.243
-It's not your daughter.
-My God, I can't, I can't...

29:40.250 --> 29:42.912
Please, just come with me right now.

29:45.290 --> 29:48.032
-What the hell was that about?
-A reporter asked them about the body.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.246
Probably heard it on a scanner.

29:49.250 --> 29:50.410
I should have prepared them for that.

29:50.420 --> 29:51.785
We didn't have anything
to tell them yet.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.826
-Billie's running out of time, guys.
-So are the parents.

29:53.830 --> 29:56.412
Oh, come on. A little hope, huh?
We'll make it. We'll make it.

30:02.960 --> 30:05.076
How's it going?

30:05.080 --> 30:06.707
The UnSub's in here somewhere.

30:06.710 --> 30:09.247
I got to bet that the police talked to him
in their initial canvass.

30:09.250 --> 30:12.617
Maybe not.
Our UnSub is a solitary individual.

30:12.620 --> 30:15.498
He isn't the type of guy to insert
himself into an investigation.

30:15.500 --> 30:16.706
I mean, wouldn't it make more sense

30:16.710 --> 30:19.281
that he wouldn't have answered
the door during the initial canvass?

30:19.290 --> 30:20.917
The neighborhood
was crawling with cops,

30:20.920 --> 30:22.569
canine units, Search and Rescues.

30:22.580 --> 30:25.572
Make him nervous and jumpy.
He'd want to avoid them at all costs.

30:25.580 --> 30:27.411
So, then he couldn't allow anyone
into his home

30:27.420 --> 30:29.706
to ask routine questions
even if the girl was bound or gagged

30:29.710 --> 30:30.950
because it'd be too risky.

30:30.960 --> 30:32.575
It is next to impossible to control

30:32.580 --> 30:34.662
breathing, speech patterns,
bodylanguage

30:34.670 --> 30:36.740
when the body's under extreme duress.

30:36.750 --> 30:38.957
Maybe if we compare hotline tips
with anyone

30:38.960 --> 30:41.326
who was_n'_t_at home
durIng the InItIal canvass.

30:41.330 --> 30:43.958
-Or didn't answer the door.
-We'll find our UnSub.

30:43.960 --> 30:45.370
-Let's go to it.
-Sergeant.

30:45.380 --> 30:47.371
Yeah.
-Here's what we need.

30:47.380 --> 30:48.449
Everything that comes in here...

30:49.000 --> 30:51.878
Oh, my God, Billie.

30:56.620 --> 30:59.999
You have to be strong now.
You have to.

31:14.420 --> 31:16.160
How are we doing?

31:17.460 --> 31:23.205
All her life, when my little girl
needed help, she came to me.

31:25.170 --> 31:30.119
And now when she needs me most,
there's nothing.

31:46.790 --> 31:51.784
When he got sick, he said he didn't
want to make us watch him die.

31:53.170 --> 31:55.536
He wanted the divorce.

31:55.540 --> 31:58.828
And I let her believe that it was me,
because...

31:59.920 --> 32:01.990
I don't know,

32:02.000 --> 32:06.209
it seemed better than the truth
that he was runnIng away from us.

32:07.330 --> 32:09.116
So, I lied to her.

32:10.120 --> 32:12.748
I think that's an incredible sacrifice.

32:12.750 --> 32:14.786
Except now he's sick

32:16.170 --> 32:19.378
and all I have left is a daughter
who hates me.

32:20.790 --> 32:25.989
I just...
I can't just sit around here helpless.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.786
Well, when you were first diagnosed
with cancer,

32:27.790 --> 32:29.610
you could have given up but you didn't.

32:29.620 --> 32:33.329
But there was an enemy.
Something to fight.

32:35.170 --> 32:39.038
Yeah, but it was a ghost enemy.

32:39.040 --> 32:43.534
It sneaks in, ravages you
before you even know it's there.

32:43.540 --> 32:46.282
And by the time you do know,
you're already losing.

32:46.290 --> 32:48.576
And you took on that one.

32:48.580 --> 32:51.617
Whatever will you summoned to fight
that battle, find it again.

32:51.620 --> 32:55.408
For Billie. Don't give up, sir.

32:55.420 --> 33:00.494
But it didn't matter.
I fought and it came back.

33:02.420 --> 33:03.990
The cancer won.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.242
I saw the pictures of you and her,
in her room.

33:08.380 --> 33:10.746
Pictures of you fishing.

33:10.750 --> 33:14.038
Being there for her when her dog died.
Building a shrine to her pet.

33:14.040 --> 33:17.032
Do you think that extra time
didn't matter?

33:18.670 --> 33:20.820
Are you going to find her?

33:26.000 --> 33:29.458
The men and women I work with
are the best in the world.

33:29.460 --> 33:31.826
They won't rest until they do.

33:33.290 --> 33:35.417
You have my word on that.

33:39.080 --> 33:43.665
Yeah, it was worth a try. That's right.
Thank you. Nothing.

33:43.670 --> 33:45.160
-Agent Morgan

33:45.170 --> 33:47.161
Is this the kind of thing
you're looking for?

33:47.170 --> 33:48.956
Reid.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.827
A Mr. Lomax has a neighbor
with a green SUV,

33:51.830 --> 33:54.537
but he hasn't seen him all day.
Says that's unusual.

33:54.540 --> 33:56.110
Thought he might've just been
out of town,

33:56.120 --> 33:59.078
but now he sees some lights
on over there.

33:59.880 --> 34:03.498
"1106 Springfield."
Where's our canvass sheets? 1106.

34:03.500 --> 34:08.073
1100 block. 1106. No answer.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.457
Let's go to talk with Mr. Lomax.
Nice call.

34:10.460 --> 34:12.280
All right, guys. Good luck.

34:13.670 --> 34:19.119
Mr. Lomax? Agent Morgan.
Agent Reid. FBI.

34:19.830 --> 34:22.492
Holy smokes, that was fast.

34:22.500 --> 34:26.038
Did you call in a tip
about your neighbor, Don Curtis?

34:26.040 --> 34:29.703
Lives down the street.
I saw the news thIng, you know?

34:29.710 --> 34:32.998
I was thinking,
Don drives a dark green Explorer

34:33.000 --> 34:35.412
and he's at the park all the time.

34:35.420 --> 34:38.162
I figured, like they said on the
television, maybe he knows something,

34:38.170 --> 34:41.378
but doesn't know that he knows it.
Know what I mean?

34:41.380 --> 34:42.699
Where's his Explorer now?

34:42.710 --> 34:46.111
It's usually in the driveway,
but I haven't seen it today.

34:46.120 --> 34:49.112
Haven't seen Don either,
which is kind of weird.

34:49.120 --> 34:52.283
We're always out front
talking about the lawns.

34:52.290 --> 34:57.114
He never has any crabgrass.
I don't know how he does it.

34:57.120 --> 34:59.202
-Do you know if he has a dog?
-Used to.

34:59.210 --> 35:01.917
A big golden retriever.
Her name was Candy.

35:01.920 --> 35:05.879
-I think she died like six months ago.
-Thank you, Mr. Lomax.

35:11.250 --> 35:14.879
Yeah, Hotch? It's Morgan.
You better get over here right now.

35:23.250 --> 35:24.376
Third house down
on the right.

35:24.380 --> 35:26.450
We knocked on the door
but nobody's answering.

35:26.460 --> 35:28.109
His neighbor said
he's definitely in there.

35:28.120 --> 35:29.917
He's got a green Ford Explorer
in the garage.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.457
-Break down the door.
-No, we don't have probable cause.

35:32.460 --> 35:34.451
He's got a green SUV,
he had a dog that died recently,

35:34.460 --> 35:35.609
he spends time in the park.

35:35.620 --> 35:36.780
And he's pretending he's not home.

35:36.790 --> 35:37.950
None of which are illegal.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.996
No judge is going to sign a warrant
based on that information.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.241
You're weighing the life of a child
against the price of a door?

35:42.250 --> 35:43.911
I'm weighing the law against the price
of a door.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.410
The girl's in the house right now
and the longer

35:45.420 --> 35:47.411
we stand here and wait,
the longer he has to finish her off.

35:47.420 --> 35:49.706
I'll call a judge.
If we go in there without a warrant,

35:49.710 --> 35:50.825
all that evidence will get thrown...

35:50.830 --> 35:53.537
We're aware of the rules of evidence.
What do you propose that we do?

35:53.540 --> 35:54.666
Gideon.

35:54.670 --> 35:57.491
We tow his car,
we impound it, and we search it.

36:04.710 --> 36:06.871
Gideon. Gideon.
Wait a minute. Gideon!

36:06.880 --> 36:09.872
Gideon, you need backup.
Gideon. Gideon.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.707
Federal agents. FBI.

36:14.710 --> 36:15.870
FBI.

36:18.710 --> 36:19.950
Clear.

36:27.290 --> 36:28.871
Look out!

36:28.880 --> 36:33.032
-Where is she?
-I don't know what you're talking about.

36:33.040 --> 36:35.668
-Where's Billie Copeland?
-Please don't hurt me.

36:35.670 --> 36:37.786
Gideon.
CURTIS: Please!

36:37.790 --> 36:39.872
Gideon.

36:39.880 --> 36:42.781
-Get him out of here.
-Let's go. Let's go.

36:42.790 --> 36:44.371
Tear the place apart!

36:53.040 --> 36:54.667
We went through everything.

36:54.670 --> 36:57.412
The house, the garage.
The girl isn't here.

36:57.420 --> 36:58.614
What?

37:03.040 --> 37:04.246
Just as we expected,

37:04.250 --> 37:08.072
he has an extensive collection of
deVIant photos and cartoon downloads.

37:08.080 --> 37:10.537
Neatly partitioned

37:10.540 --> 37:12.531
Mmm-hmm.
-Access the Internet history.

37:12.540 --> 37:14.917
Identify any pornographic sites,
shut them down.

37:14.920 --> 37:18.071
I'm uploading to Garcia as we speak.

37:20.330 --> 37:22.537
What is this

37:22.540 --> 37:25.202
It's a lot of home movies
with a bunch of kids in it.

37:25.210 --> 37:27.747
But this one, you need to see it.

37:33.960 --> 37:37.999
Shh. Remember what I'll do
if you tell.

37:39.460 --> 37:43.954
Gideon, we searched the entire house.
Upstairs, downstairs, everywhere.

37:43.960 --> 37:46.326
There's no sign of the girl
or that she's even been here.

37:46.330 --> 37:48.286
It is possible that he moved her.

37:48.290 --> 37:50.417
Polly Klaas was found 25 miles
from home.

37:50.420 --> 37:53.412
Danielle Van Dam, 30,
Samantha Runnion, 52,

37:53.420 --> 37:56.912
but, keep in mind,
we were 20 hours late getting involved.

37:56.920 --> 37:58.160
The man doesn't take chances.

37:58.170 --> 37:59.785
He wouldn't drive around
with the girl in the car.

37:59.790 --> 38:02.202
He took her and got her off of the street
as quickly as possible.

38:02.210 --> 38:03.996
Just keep looking.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.160
I'm on it.

38:13.080 --> 38:16.868
Your tapes, your computer,
are full of child pornography.

38:18.920 --> 38:21.457
Do you guys have a warrant?
I didn't see a warrant.

38:21.460 --> 38:22.666
You're going to prison.

38:22.670 --> 38:27.994
Right now, for how long is up to you.
It's in your best interest to help us.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.706
I want a lawyer.

38:34.210 --> 38:36.166
Then we won't be able
to talk to you any more.

38:36.170 --> 38:38.377
We won't hear your side of the story

38:38.380 --> 38:40.371
and we won't get Billie Copeland
back to her parents.

38:40.380 --> 38:42.245
Now you can help us.

38:43.880 --> 38:45.450
Make it right.

38:49.830 --> 38:53.414
Can you close the door? It's cold.

39:07.250 --> 39:09.662
-Curtis lawyered up.
-Of course, he did.

39:09.670 --> 39:11.786
That's the first smart thing he's done.

39:11.790 --> 39:13.496
We broke into his house
and without Billie,

39:13.500 --> 39:14.740
we don't have
the eXIgent CIrcumstances

39:14.750 --> 39:15.876
we need to make this stick.

39:15.880 --> 39:17.029
We may have to let him go.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.200
I told you
we should have waited.

39:18.210 --> 39:19.450
Yes, I know. We made a call.

39:19.460 --> 39:22.202
And if there are any recriminations,
we will take full responsibility.

39:22.210 --> 39:24.280
Hotch, he's the man.

39:24.290 --> 39:27.703
Jason, I agree,
but we may have been overly hasty.

39:27.710 --> 39:28.916
Hasty?

39:28.920 --> 39:31.821
You know as well as I do, unless
we actually find Billie in this house,

39:31.830 --> 39:34.822
any evidence we find,
is fruit of the poison tree.

39:48.290 --> 39:49.746
Insulation.

39:55.290 --> 39:56.746
There it is.

39:59.880 --> 40:01.916
Hotch, get me up there.

40:04.120 --> 40:05.826
-Here.
-All right.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.496
Go. Go.

40:17.210 --> 40:18.666
She's here.

40:21.250 --> 40:23.662
Hi, Billie. My name's Jason.

40:25.540 --> 40:28.168
I'm here to take you home, sweetie.

40:30.120 --> 40:33.203
Your mommy and daddy
are very worried about you.

40:33.210 --> 40:34.996
I want to go home.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.660
I want to go home.

40:40.460 --> 40:43.577
-Let's go see your mom and dad, huh?
-Uh-huh.

40:45.420 --> 40:46.956
Oh, I forgot.

40:49.420 --> 40:51.786
I took that for luck.

40:51.790 --> 40:55.112
Let's bring it back to
where it belongs, okay?

40:55.120 --> 40:58.283
Let's go see your mommy and daddy.

40:58.290 --> 41:01.703
Hotch! Here she comes.

41:03.460 --> 41:06.418
Here you go, sweetie. Watch your arm.

41:06.420 --> 41:07.990
Watch her arm.

41:22.880 --> 41:26.498
"Measure not the work until
the day's out and the labor done."

41:26.500 --> 41:28.491
Elizabeth Barrett Browning.

41:28.500 --> 41:31.242
I got absolutely nothing.
-Nothing.

41:32.540 --> 41:34.110
Two pair of aces.

41:34.120 --> 41:36.327
Oh. Shut up.
-Oh, get out of town.

41:36.330 --> 41:37.706
See, why you always winning?
No.

41:37.710 --> 41:38.995
Because he cheats.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.572
-Poker, it's mathematics, it's statistics.
-Oh, I know.

41:42.580 --> 41:43.911
He's from Vegas.

41:43.920 --> 41:46.571
-House rules.
-There's that, too.

41:46.580 --> 41:48.536
All right, shuffle.
MORGAN: Yeah, give me a card.

41:48.540 --> 41:51.077
-Hey, Hotch.
-Yeah.

41:51.080 --> 41:54.743
Did you send flowers
to that tech room girl, Garcia,

41:54.750 --> 41:57.321
-and say they were from me?
-Yeah.

41:57.330 --> 41:58.456
Why?

41:58.460 --> 42:00.826
Jason, people need to know
that they're important,

42:00.830 --> 42:03.207
and sometimes you forget that.

42:04.420 --> 42:07.912
Well, I already sent her a gift.
An MP3 player.

42:07.920 --> 42:10.320
They last longer unless you drop them
or the battery dies,

42:10.330 --> 42:12.036
whichever comes ﬁrst.

42:12.040 --> 42:16.033
So, she got two gifts

42:23.580 --> 42:25.912
Maybe not, huh?

42:25.920 --> 42:29.162
I think the Copelands
are going to stay together.

42:29.170 --> 42:31.286
-Well, good.
-He's dying.

42:32.460 --> 42:33.916
He's having a difficult time.

42:33.920 --> 42:36.377
You know, Billie's kind of used to him
not being there.

42:36.380 --> 42:40.168
So, maybe it would be better
if they stayed apart.

42:42.960 --> 42:45.747
-No, it wouldn't.
-How do you know?

42:45.750 --> 42:47.035
I know.

42:50.120 --> 42:51.496
Just know.
