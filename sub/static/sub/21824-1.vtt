00:02.000 --> 00:03.001
Previously...

00:03.120 --> 00:05.043
The Battle of Culloden
will happen... Today.

00:05.120 --> 00:06.770
Just as history foretold.

00:07.160 --> 00:08.810
And we must go now.

00:09.240 --> 00:11.322
You promised me that if it came to this,

00:11.400 --> 00:15.724
you will go back through the stones,
back home, you and the bairn.

00:16.640 --> 00:19.291
My name is William Grey,
second son, Viscount Melton.

00:19.360 --> 00:21.328
I'm afraid I'm not prepared to kill ye.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.640
I owe you my life.

00:25.040 --> 00:26.041
I'm pregnant.

00:26.240 --> 00:27.241
No.

00:27.560 --> 00:28.607
It's Jamie's.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.485
I've been offered a post at Harvard.

00:31.320 --> 00:32.320
Boston?

00:32.400 --> 00:33.890
Yes. I want us to be together.

00:34.040 --> 00:38.090
We will raise this child as our own.
Yours and mine.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.729
I cannot share you with another man.
You must let him go.

00:43.800 --> 00:46.883
I know. I accept your conditions.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.286
Sing me a song

00:51.360 --> 00:54.125
Of a lass that is gone

00:54.240 --> 00:56.925
Say, could that lass

00:57.000 --> 00:59.128
Be I?

00:59.840 --> 01:02.047
Merry of soul

01:02.120 --> 01:04.851
She sailed on a day

01:05.120 --> 01:07.248
Over the sea

01:07.320 --> 01:10.130
To Skye

01:10.360 --> 01:13.091
Billow and breeze

01:13.160 --> 01:15.288
Islands and seas

01:15.360 --> 01:19.763
Mountains of rain and sun

01:20.760 --> 01:23.206
Al! that was good

01:23.280 --> 01:25.851
All that was fair

01:25.920 --> 01:28.400
All that was me

01:28.480 --> 01:30.926
ls gone

01:31.000 --> 01:33.367
Sing me a song

01:33.440 --> 01:36.330
Of a lass that is gone

01:36.400 --> 01:38.721
Say, could that lass

01:38.800 --> 01:40.962
Be I?

01:41.560 --> 01:43.722
Merry of soul

01:43.800 --> 01:46.724
She sailed on a day

01:46.800 --> 01:50.646
Over the sea

01:51.080 --> 01:56.803
To Skye

03:00.000 --> 03:01.843
Bring that block over there.

04:23.520 --> 04:24.760
Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

05:30.840 --> 05:34.367
The travel canteen was a gift
from my father on my 21st birthday.

05:34.440 --> 05:37.887
Mark me, James,
I will watch the Duke of Cumberland

05:37.960 --> 05:40.122
drink from it when this day is done.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.641
This is nothing but a diversion!

07:13.720 --> 07:15.802
Cumberland wants to rattle our nerves.

07:15.880 --> 07:20.204
If we stand fast and force him
to come to us across the moor,

07:21.320 --> 07:22.606
then we will have them, sir.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.205
- The time is now.
- Aye.

07:24.280 --> 07:29.127
Sire, give the command to charge
while there is still a chance.

08:31.800 --> 08:34.121
And where've you been?
Enjoying a wee whiskey

08:37.799 --> 08:38.881
Ye're welcome.

08:39.960 --> 08:41.688
And the Lallybroch men are safe home.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.926
Burn it up, boys, all along the line!

09:08.240 --> 09:09.241
Fire!

09:11.240 --> 09:12.287
Fire!

09:15.800 --> 09:17.006
Fire!

13:31.520 --> 13:32.646
Are you alive?

13:35.400 --> 13:37.323
Jamie, are ye alive, man?

13:39.920 --> 13:40.967
Dunno...

13:43.320 --> 13:44.321
Quiet.

13:45.160 --> 13:47.083
There's redcoats still about,

13:47.160 --> 13:48.730
and they're killin' the wounded
where they lie.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.326
Can ye stand?

13:52.600 --> 13:55.570
Let me be. Let me be.

13:55.640 --> 13:57.802
I'm not gonna leave ye to die in the mud.

13:58.280 --> 14:01.921
Even if ye are a pig-headed loon
who canna hold his whiskey.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.010
Drink you under the table.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.690
Yeah, I'll see you can.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.890
Boston
1948

14:31.960 --> 14:33.883
Are you sure we can afford all this?

14:33.960 --> 14:35.246
It's a little tight,

14:38.480 --> 14:40.721
but you've always said
you wanted a real home.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.884
It certainly is real.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.407
All this space just for the two of us.

14:51.480 --> 14:52.891
Soon to be three.

14:55.400 --> 14:56.401
Yes.

15:00.440 --> 15:03.250
The history professor's study, I presume?

15:04.560 --> 15:05.607
Well, maybe.

15:05.680 --> 15:09.526
The study can be
wherever the lady of the house desires.

15:12.960 --> 15:15.884
Well, the lady of the house
desires it thus.

15:22.600 --> 15:25.490
The kitchen, where, presumably,
the lady of the house

15:25.560 --> 15:29.167
will be rustling up various
appetising dishes and...

15:29.280 --> 15:30.281
"Rustling?"

15:30.360 --> 15:32.203
That's what they say in America.

15:32.880 --> 15:35.326
"I mean to rustle me up some vittles."

15:36.960 --> 15:40.203
Well, l wouldn’t get
your hopes up too high, partner.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.729
I'm a little out of practice these days.

15:46.440 --> 15:47.566
Hey.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.448
I will be happy with whatever you make.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.007
Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ!

17:24.160 --> 17:27.003
- Like some help with that?
- No, I'm good. Thank you.

17:27.079 --> 17:30.562
Now, just you never mind. Here.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.088
I remember when I was having my first.

17:34.160 --> 17:35.924
My back ached something fierce,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.890
and that handsome, but lazy sack of bones
I call a husband

17:38.960 --> 17:40.849
never did lift a finger.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.251
I can manage, really.

17:42.960 --> 17:46.646
Well, of course you can manage, my dear,
but why should you when you can have help?

17:47.640 --> 17:48.926
Millie Nelson.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.481
Claire Randall.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.244
Where did you learn to do that?

17:56.040 --> 17:59.522
My uncle taught me
how to cook over the campfire.

18:00.080 --> 18:03.243
Sounds dirty. All that ash and soot.

18:04.280 --> 18:07.204
Actually, it gives the food
a really lovely, smoky flavour.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.806
Your husband must like it.
That's all that matters, I suppose.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.527
Yes. Well...

18:15.560 --> 18:16.800
I hope so.

18:19.320 --> 18:21.448
So, you're just gonna spring it on him.

18:22.240 --> 18:24.163
He likes surprises, does he?

18:27.960 --> 18:28.961
Not really.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.203
Well, you're a braver woman than I.

18:32.280 --> 18:34.123
I swear to God, if I surprised Jerry

18:34.200 --> 18:37.170
with something other
than pot roast, meatloaf,

18:37.240 --> 18:40.767
baked beans with cabbage one night,
he'd up and have a heart attack.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.690
Hey, now there's an idea.

18:45.680 --> 18:50.527
No, actually, I think Frank will really
like something different for a change.

18:51.680 --> 18:56.447
He's very progressive.
Very... Open-minded.

18:58.040 --> 19:01.567
Well, God love Jerry, and I do,
despite what you might think.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.246
He's really no different
than most men in this world

19:04.320 --> 19:07.403
who don't want their wives
doing anything out of the ordinary.

19:07.480 --> 19:12.042
Just cook, clean, raise the kids,
look pretty when they meet the boss.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.246
You're lucky.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.367
You won't find
another man like Frank again.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.411
There, slowly.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.209
So... Do we run for it?

20:16.520 --> 20:20.002
I'm not running anywhere.
Barely a man here can stand.

20:22.280 --> 20:27.127
If ye can go, Rupert, then go.
Do not linger on our account.

20:29.320 --> 20:32.449
No. I'll bide.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.922
For one thing, the British
are still thick as lice out there.

20:37.840 --> 20:38.887
Aye.

20:40.040 --> 20:42.611
Even those who fled the field Yesterday
will not get far.

20:43.760 --> 20:46.161
I heard the British troops
passing by quick-march.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.929
It will not be hard for them
to hunt down our bedraggled lot.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.731
Claire, darling,
we need lo leave in 20 minutes.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.326
Coming, Frank.

21:22.600 --> 21:25.046
Got to look pretty when you meet the boss.

21:35.400 --> 21:40.361
Truman's ascension to the presidency
was an accident of history,

21:40.840 --> 21:45.164
a cosmic joke meant to humble the nation
just as America's power

21:45.280 --> 21:48.170
had reached its Olympian zenith
at the end of the war.

21:48.240 --> 21:52.928
And since that sad day when he took up
the reins of government,

21:53.040 --> 21:58.524
the "haberdasher from Missouri"
has proven himself to be totally unequal

21:58.600 --> 22:02.844
to the task of assuming the mantle
of Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln.

22:03.320 --> 22:06.164
Obviously, we are both new
to these shores,

22:07.240 --> 22:11.211
but if I was a betting man, l wouldn't
count the Democratic nominee out just yet.

22:12.200 --> 22:15.568
Well, you're alone
in that sentiment, Professor.

22:15.640 --> 22:19.565
Certainly, the press believes that his
defeat in November is all but assured.

22:20.440 --> 22:24.445
Perhaps I prefer it to believing we're
doomed to the presidency of Thomas Dewey.

22:24.920 --> 22:28.288
Well, I read a piece just last week
that said the president actually

22:28.360 --> 22:29.850
has more support than it appears.

22:32.320 --> 22:33.446
I beg your pardon?

22:33.960 --> 22:38.249
Well, I was just saying that I read
a column in The Globe that predicted

22:38.320 --> 22:39.481
victory for the president

22:39.560 --> 22:43.281
if he continues to pound away
at the Republican congress as ineffectual,

22:43.360 --> 22:47.729
whereas Mr Dewey
only offers the voters platitudes.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.490
“A column in The Globe."

22:54.160 --> 22:57.289
Professor Randall, you're gonna have
to pay closer attention

22:57.360 --> 22:59.044
to your wife's reading habits.

22:59.360 --> 23:01.442
She keeps reading The Globe,
the next thing you know,

23:01.520 --> 23:03.807
she'll be trying to get women
into Harvard Law.

23:03.880 --> 23:07.805
Harvard Medical enrolled
female students three years ago.

23:09.040 --> 23:11.042
A bone cast in the general direction

23:11.160 --> 23:14.448
of Eleanor Roosevelt
and her coterie of agitators.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.849
My understanding is the girls
are barely adequate in their studies.

23:18.760 --> 23:24.085
Past experience has shown
few women succeed as physicians.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.801
Dean Jackson, I don't believe I mentioned

23:28.280 --> 23:31.727
my wife was a combat nurse with the
Royal Army Medical Corps during the war.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.086
Really?

23:33.720 --> 23:36.246
Well. Very patriotic, Mrs Randall.

23:36.880 --> 23:39.804
Pitching in in time of crisis
and that sort of thing.

23:40.840 --> 23:43.810
But I'm sure you were happy
to resume more important

23:44.960 --> 23:49.045
and fitting domestic concerns for a lady
with the conclusion of the war.

23:55.120 --> 23:58.090
Yes. I'm very happy-

23:58.720 --> 24:00.051
Of course you are.

24:00.120 --> 24:03.966
What young woman wouldn't be at the
prospect of impending maternal bliss?

24:04.880 --> 24:07.281
Have you had an opportunity to examine

24:07.360 --> 24:11.604
the prospectus for the spring seminar
on the Wars of the Roses?

24:12.040 --> 24:15.647
I fear Professor Holloway
is overloading the schedule...

24:42.360 --> 24:43.566
You all right

24:46.960 --> 24:48.086
You're very quiet.

24:50.880 --> 24:51.927
I'm fine.

25:14.640 --> 25:15.801
Murtagh.

25:17.960 --> 25:20.645
Murtagh... Aye.

25:22.240 --> 25:24.242
What happened to Murtagh?

25:26.280 --> 25:27.281
I dinna ken.

25:29.720 --> 25:32.007
Any word on Murtagh Fitzgibbons Fraser

25:33.840 --> 25:35.251
I lost sight of him in the fight.

25:35.960 --> 25:37.724
I hope to God he's already dead.

25:45.240 --> 25:47.641
Private! You two, check on the back.

25:48.600 --> 25:49.886
Right away, sir.

25:52.720 --> 25:53.767
Christ.

25:56.360 --> 25:57.725
I am Lord Melton.

25:59.840 --> 26:01.649
Rupert MacKenzie, of Leoch.

26:02.280 --> 26:05.682
And others late of the forces
of His Majesty, King James.

26:06.200 --> 26:07.326
So I surmised.

26:08.080 --> 26:10.321
I have been ordered by His Grace,

26:10.400 --> 26:12.880
the Duke of Cumberland, to execute any man

26:13.280 --> 26:15.886
found to have engaged
in the recent treasonous rebellion.

26:16.720 --> 26:19.644
Does any man here
claim innocence of treason?

26:26.520 --> 26:29.524
No, My Lord. Traitors all.

26:31.960 --> 26:33.724
Shall we be hanged, then?

26:35.160 --> 26:38.323
You will be shot. Like soldiers.

26:40.880 --> 26:42.120
Thank you, My Lord.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.648
You have an hour
in which to prepare yourselves.

26:52.080 --> 26:54.526
If any of you wishes writing materials

26:55.800 --> 27:00.169
to compose a letter, perhaps, the clerk
of my company will attend to you.

28:26.360 --> 28:28.806
Tell you, after eight years of rationing,

28:28.880 --> 28:33.966
I could wake up to the smell of bacon
and eggs for the rest of my natural life.

28:34.520 --> 28:36.887
That's the last of the bacon, I'm afraid.

28:36.960 --> 28:39.122
I'll go down to the market
later this afternoon.

28:39.200 --> 28:41.806
All right. Did you sleep well?

28:43.800 --> 28:45.882
It's a little hard to get
comfortable these days.

28:47.360 --> 28:48.361
I've got it.

29:06.200 --> 29:08.123
I've said it before, I'll say it again.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.244
These are an abomination.

29:10.320 --> 29:12.527
Well, that's how they drink it here.

29:13.680 --> 29:18.720
It doesn't even smell like tea after weeks
of sitting in these little paper diapers.

29:21.280 --> 29:22.850
There is coffee if you'd rather.

29:23.560 --> 29:26.450
I mean, why change something
that works perfectly well?

29:27.240 --> 29:31.245
Tea in a tin. Scoop it out.
Put it in a pot.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.969
- Is it really so difficult?
- I suppose not.

29:35.480 --> 29:38.927
Well, I'm not sure I'll ever understand
the American obsession with the new.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.924
Like everything has to be new, new, new.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.561
Well,

29:44.520 --> 29:48.081
that's one of the reasons
I like this country. It's young...

29:48.800 --> 29:50.768
- Thank you.
-It's eager.

29:50.840 --> 29:53.411
It's constantly looking
towards the future.

29:56.200 --> 29:59.090
- You know, I've been thinking.
- Will you pass me some toast?

30:00.880 --> 30:01.881
Thanks.

30:01.960 --> 30:04.008
I'd like to apply for citizenship.

30:04.800 --> 30:05.801
Really?

30:07.320 --> 30:09.721
Well, I've lived all over the world,

30:10.520 --> 30:14.206
and I've never really
had a strong attachment to England.

30:16.200 --> 30:19.363
And I want our child to have a real home.

30:27.440 --> 30:28.680
Our child...

30:52.400 --> 30:54.528
Since when were
you never attached to England?

30:55.720 --> 30:57.882
Can you walk away from
your heritage that easily?

30:59.520 --> 31:01.761
Hastings and Magna Carta,

31:02.800 --> 31:05.565
Drake, Marlborough, the Tudors,

31:06.160 --> 31:10.051
Stuarts, the Plantagenets.
These are things I fought a war for.

31:13.440 --> 31:16.250
-It's just something I want to do.
- Well, there's no need.

31:17.520 --> 31:20.364
My employment provides us both
with residency indefinitely.

31:29.480 --> 31:31.130
That's not what this is about.

31:32.840 --> 31:33.887
No.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.929
It's not what this is about.

31:44.120 --> 31:47.727
It's about that.
A wife who won't let me touch her.

31:49.240 --> 31:53.290
Admit it. You are using this pregnancy
to keep me at a distance.

31:53.800 --> 31:57.247
You have retreated further and further
into your shell ever since we got here.

31:57.320 --> 31:58.560
I'm sorry.

31:58.640 --> 32:02.122
Don't walk away, Claire.
It is time we dealt with this like adults.

32:02.240 --> 32:04.163
As opposed to the way
that I've been dealing with it

32:04.240 --> 32:06.129
Please stop! Stop!

32:08.080 --> 32:09.411
And talk to me.

32:09.880 --> 32:11.245
And say what, Frank?

32:11.320 --> 32:13.209
What is it that you want from me?

32:13.280 --> 32:16.204
I want to know when you're going
to come back from the fucking past!

32:16.280 --> 32:21.525
You asked me to leave behind
everything that truly mattered to me!

32:21.600 --> 32:24.171
And yet it's fine for you to go on
about the things that you've missed

32:24.240 --> 32:25.651
in the good old days.

32:25.720 --> 32:28.963
"Never talk about the past."
That was the bargain.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.485
And I've kept that bargain to the letter.

32:30.560 --> 32:33.404
No, the bargain was
that we raise this baby together.

32:34.120 --> 32:37.806
Our child. It hasn't even been born yet,
and you will not let me in...

32:37.880 --> 32:39.245
Let alone touch you, God forbid.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.406
Is it sex? Is that what this is?

32:42.880 --> 32:45.121
When you need a good fuck
and you can't find one?

32:45.720 --> 32:47.802
Well, I hear there's some
lovely girls at Radcliffe

32:47.880 --> 32:50.281
who would just die
over your English accent.

32:50.360 --> 32:52.727
Well, I'm not the one who's
been fucking other people.

33:29.400 --> 33:31.562
I didn't force
this bargain on you, Claire.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.368
I didn't force you to come to Boston.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.204
And I'm not forcing you to stay.

33:41.880 --> 33:44.042
I never thought otherwise.

33:46.600 --> 33:48.921
Go... Or stay.

33:50.240 --> 33:53.801
But please... Do it because
it's what you really want to do.

34:29.280 --> 34:30.360
Reload.

34:45.719 --> 34:48.291
I beg ye not to judge them
by the same standard

34:48.360 --> 34:50.408
that ye apply to the rest of the men.

34:50.480 --> 34:51.527
They're naught but lads.

34:51.600 --> 34:54.251
They canna be held responsible
for their actions.

34:55.199 --> 34:57.567
His Grace has specifically directed that

34:57.640 --> 34:59.529
there be no exceptions
made on amount of age.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.445
I'm sorry.

35:04.600 --> 35:09.208
Hey, hey. Steady now, lads...
Hey? It'll be over soon.

35:10.240 --> 35:13.084
Chin up, okay All right.

35:20.840 --> 35:22.080
Names?

35:22.760 --> 35:25.491
Giles... McMartin.

35:27.080 --> 35:28.525
Frederick MacBean.

35:43.200 --> 35:45.487
Do you want me to write
a letter for you, Jamie?

35:45.560 --> 35:48.166
Something to yer family, perhaps

35:51.560 --> 35:52.925
No. No, no.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.166
Let it be.

35:58.400 --> 35:59.640
What about yer wife?

36:01.280 --> 36:02.281
What about Claire?

36:09.800 --> 36:11.370
She's gone.

36:14.200 --> 36:15.611
Where did she go?

36:21.720 --> 36:23.643
Does any man wish to be next?

36:28.600 --> 36:29.601
Aye.

36:41.720 --> 36:43.324
I'll take my leave of ye now, Jamie.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.963
I'll see you again soon.

37:15.760 --> 37:17.489
Gordon Killick.

37:39.240 --> 37:40.844
I'm glad ye're awake.

37:42.080 --> 37:46.210
I didna want to say farewell while
you snored and farted in yer sleep.

37:46.960 --> 37:51.170
You always snored
louder than any man I ever heard.

37:52.120 --> 37:54.521
Folk always blamed me for it,

37:56.200 --> 37:58.441
but... Angus was the one who snored.

38:03.280 --> 38:04.930
It'll be good to see him again.

38:07.080 --> 38:09.287
Be good to see the two of you together.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.562
I'm not saying I forgive you for Dougal.

38:21.840 --> 38:24.571
But I'll no' go to my grave
hatin' you for it either.

38:25.720 --> 38:29.486
The Lord will judge us both,
and I trust in his mercy.

38:33.840 --> 38:35.330
Farewell, Jamie.

38:38.920 --> 38:39.967
Reload.

38:40.040 --> 38:41.849
Does any man wish to be next?

38:43.360 --> 38:44.407
Aye.

38:59.120 --> 39:02.249
Rupert Thomas Alexander MacKenzie.

39:05.280 --> 39:07.647
I mean to set a quick pace,
so try to keep up.

39:25.600 --> 39:26.601
Next.

41:08.400 --> 41:12.485
Dear Reverend, I find myself in need
of your assistance once more.

41:12.560 --> 41:14.130
I hope you'll indulge me in undertaking

41:14.240 --> 41:17.164
some research regarding
an 18th century Highlander

41:17.240 --> 41:19.083
who fought in the Battle of Culioden.

41:19.800 --> 41:22.087
His name was James Fraser.

41:22.160 --> 41:24.128
- Frank?
- Claire.

41:27.920 --> 41:28.921
What is it?

41:29.680 --> 41:30.920
My waters have broken.

41:33.040 --> 41:36.123
All right. I'll warm up the car.

41:41.360 --> 41:44.364
The ambulatory wounded have all been
executed, My Lord.

41:44.480 --> 41:46.084
We'll have to carry the rest out.

41:46.160 --> 41:48.766
Have the Corporal of the Guard
select stretcher bearers.

41:48.840 --> 41:52.208
Yes, My Lord.
Are they to be shot lying down...

41:52.320 --> 41:54.084
Prop them up, certainly.

41:55.480 --> 41:56.481
Good Lord.

41:57.720 --> 42:00.883
No man in the King's custody shall be shot
lying down on my watch.

42:01.360 --> 42:05.285
- Not even traitors.
- Yes, My Lord. Sorry, My Lord.

42:07.920 --> 42:10.287
You men who are unable to walk

42:10.360 --> 42:12.408
shall be carried outside
to face your sentence.

42:13.320 --> 42:15.129
Does any man wish to go first?

42:15.720 --> 42:16.721
Aye.

42:17.880 --> 42:19.245
Aye, get this over with.

42:21.680 --> 42:22.681
Name?

42:23.640 --> 42:24.721
James...

42:25.920 --> 42:29.925
Alexander... Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser...

42:33.680 --> 42:35.170
Of Broch Tuarach.

42:37.960 --> 42:38.961
Fraser?

42:45.480 --> 42:47.244
Are you the Jacobite known as "Red Jamie?"

42:48.520 --> 42:50.682
I've been called that by my enemies.

42:51.760 --> 42:53.205
God's blood.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.480
Does any other man wish to go next?

43:01.040 --> 43:04.044
Aye. I'll go.

43:09.760 --> 43:13.003
Does the name John Grey
mean anything to you?

43:14.920 --> 43:19.403
Listen to me! Grey. John William Grey.

43:19.800 --> 43:20.801
Do you know that name?

43:23.560 --> 43:24.800
Look...

43:27.320 --> 43:32.042
Either shoot me... Or go away.

43:37.920 --> 43:42.369
Near Corrieyairack. A boy, about 16.

43:43.080 --> 43:45.162
You encountered him in the wood.

43:47.120 --> 43:48.167
Aye.

43:50.480 --> 43:53.689
Aye, the one that tried to kill me
when I was taking a pish.

43:55.760 --> 43:57.728
I broke his arm, I recall.

44:04.520 --> 44:06.443
John Grey is my brother.

44:07.280 --> 44:11.171
He told me of his meeting with you,
that you then spared his life,

44:11.240 --> 44:14.403
and he made you a promise. Is that true?

44:18.920 --> 44:20.809
Aye, he promised to kill me.

44:26.640 --> 44:28.608
But I dinna mind if you do it for him.

44:31.560 --> 44:34.086
He said he owed you a debt of honour.

44:34.840 --> 44:36.410
Present... Fire!

44:41.040 --> 44:42.201
My Lord?

44:43.240 --> 44:46.164
This is a deuce of a situation, Wallace.

44:48.400 --> 44:50.448
This Jacobite scum is Red Jamie.

44:52.280 --> 44:54.442
- The one on the broadsheets?
- The same.

44:54.800 --> 44:58.327
His Grace would be more than pleased
lo hear of such an illustrious prisoner.

44:58.800 --> 45:00.086
They have not yet found Charles Stuart,

45:00.160 --> 45:03.004
but a few well-known Jacobites should
appease the crowds at Tower Hill.

45:03.080 --> 45:04.525
Shall I send a message to His Grace?

45:04.600 --> 45:07.171
No. This filthy wretch spared
my youngest brothers life,

45:07.240 --> 45:12.167
thus incurring a bloody great
debt of honour upon my family.

45:12.720 --> 45:16.008
I see. So you can't give him
to His Grace after all.

45:17.760 --> 45:19.205
I can't even shoot the bastard.

45:19.320 --> 45:22.244
Not without discrediting
my brother's sworn word.

45:22.320 --> 45:23.810
I willna tell if you dinna.

45:24.800 --> 45:26.245
Perhaps we would shoot him...

45:29.480 --> 45:30.606
Under an alias.

45:35.280 --> 45:37.169
Present... Fire!

45:41.880 --> 45:43.564
It will be dark in three hours.

45:47.960 --> 45:52.522
Continue with the executions and then find
a small wagon and have it filled with hay.

45:52.600 --> 45:55.001
Pick a driver' someone discreet,

45:55.480 --> 46:00.520
by which I mean willing to accept a bribe,
and have them here before it gets dark.

46:00.880 --> 46:04.771
Yes, My Lord.
And what about the prisoner, My Lord?

46:05.560 --> 46:06.686
What about him?

46:06.760 --> 46:08.410
He's too weak to crawl, let alone run.

46:08.880 --> 46:11.963
He's not going anywhere.
At least not until the wagon gets here.

46:12.080 --> 46:15.243
I don't want to go anywhere.
I want to be shot.

46:17.240 --> 46:18.366
Raving.

46:20.400 --> 46:22.323
I doubt he'll live through the journey.

46:24.320 --> 46:30.168
But at least his death won't be
on my head, or on my family.

46:31.120 --> 46:34.806
Yes, My Lord. Where are we sending him?

47:16.760 --> 47:18.205
They're taking their sweet time.

47:20.880 --> 47:22.405
I'm here, I'm here.

47:22.480 --> 47:26.166
It's all right. Breathe.

47:26.600 --> 47:30.366
It's all right. It's perfectly normal.

47:34.880 --> 47:37.201
I'm glad I missed you with that ashtray.

47:39.200 --> 47:42.602
Your aim was spot on.
It was my cat-like reflexes that saved me.

47:43.040 --> 47:45.884
Good evening, Mr and Mrs Randall.

47:45.960 --> 47:49.123
I'm Dr Thorne. I'll be your
attending physician this evening.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.326
Where's Dr Bell?

47:50.400 --> 47:53.165
He was unavailable.
I left a message with his service.

47:53.480 --> 47:56.802
Stay calm, do exactly as I tell you
when I tell you to do it,

47:56.880 --> 47:59.645
and all will be well.
There's no reason to panic.

47:59.720 --> 48:03.167
- I'm not panicking. I...
- How far apart are her contractions?

48:04.280 --> 48:06.044
- I'm not sure.
- Three minutes.

48:06.760 --> 48:08.046
First Child?

48:08.120 --> 48:09.406
- Yes.
- No.

48:11.240 --> 48:15.882
I had a miscarriage... About a year ago.

48:17.200 --> 48:18.201
Of course.

48:18.280 --> 48:20.408
That does complicate things a bit.

48:20.480 --> 48:23.723
Higher risk factors
for both mother and child.

48:24.520 --> 48:28.127
Well, I think it's time we got your
wife into delivery, Mr Randall.

48:28.200 --> 48:32.569
Give her a kiss and I'll take charge
of her from here. You'll be fine.

48:36.960 --> 48:39.042
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about the miscarriage.

48:39.120 --> 48:40.121
None of that matters now.

48:41.120 --> 48:42.531
Just promise me one thing.

48:42.960 --> 48:45.088
Try not to throw
an ashtray at that doctor.

48:47.880 --> 48:49.450
I can't promise that.

48:53.520 --> 48:55.010
I wish I could be there.

48:55.880 --> 48:58.406
No, you don't. Trust me.

48:58.920 --> 49:01.321
I'll be waiting, okay? No matter how long.

49:01.640 --> 49:03.005
Off you go, Mr Randall.

49:03.440 --> 49:05.761
The father's waiting room
is down the hall and to the left.

49:05.880 --> 49:08.360
Just follow the smell
of cigarettes and flop sweat.

49:09.240 --> 49:12.289
Claire... I love you.

49:25.320 --> 49:28.005
Don't worry, Mrs Randall,
you won't feel a thing.

49:28.080 --> 49:30.321
And when you wake up, you'll be a mother.

49:31.720 --> 49:34.485
Wait, no. I don't want to be put under.

49:35.440 --> 49:37.807
Nurse Watkins, if you'd be so kind

49:37.880 --> 49:40.531
Now, now, Mrs Randall, all is well.

49:40.600 --> 49:43.206
Well, you needn't worry your pretty
little head about anything.

49:43.280 --> 49:45.726
Please. Don't tell me what I need.

49:45.840 --> 49:49.003
I'm perfectly capable of deciding
how I want my baby delivered.

49:49.880 --> 49:51.041
I just...

49:52.960 --> 49:53.961
What was that?

49:54.040 --> 49:56.088
Just something to calm you down.

49:56.680 --> 50:01.607
Good night, Mrs Randall.
Leave everything to us.

50:02.440 --> 50:03.726
You bastard.

50:19.200 --> 50:20.201
Karma

50:21.480 --> 50:22.481
Jamie!

50:24.040 --> 50:25.849
Jamie, can you hear me?

50:25.960 --> 50:27.962
Jamie, can ye speak?

50:34.120 --> 50:35.565
Am I dead?

50:36.240 --> 50:38.527
Ye've come home... To Lallybroch.

50:46.040 --> 50:47.530
Lallybroch.

50:54.400 --> 50:56.721
I can't believe
you're really home, brother.

51:11.920 --> 51:13.285
Where's my baby?

51:19.440 --> 51:20.726
Where is my baby?

51:21.200 --> 51:23.407
- Mrs Randall, you're awake.
- Where's my baby

51:23.760 --> 51:26.411
Where's my baby? Is it dead

51:27.520 --> 51:29.124
This way, Mr Randall.

51:31.120 --> 51:33.168
Claire. Claire.

51:35.160 --> 51:37.731
It's all right. Here she is.

51:44.480 --> 51:47.529
There she is. It's a baby girl.

51:53.600 --> 51:55.090
She's all right.

51:56.600 --> 51:57.965
She's perfect, Claire.

51:59.360 --> 52:01.249
You are so beautiful.

52:03.760 --> 52:05.285
Just like her mother.

52:10.920 --> 52:12.251
Frank...

52:13.880 --> 52:16.929
- I've been so horrid to you.

Yes.

52:27.680 --> 52:30.570

Yes.

52:45.800 --> 52:50.249

What a beautiful little angel.

52:55.160 --> 52:58.130
