00:44.762 --> 00:46.467
Terribly exciting, isn't it, sir?

00:46.478 --> 00:47.701
Why is that, George?

00:47.821 --> 00:49.301
One of these young ladies, sir,

00:49.323 --> 00:51.358
is slated to become Mrs. Rodney Strong.

00:51.381 --> 00:52.854
I must say this eligible bachelor

00:52.863 --> 00:55.191
could do a lot worse than my Elizabeth.

01:00.198 --> 01:02.287
- My God!
- Surely your husband

01:02.304 --> 01:04.735
doesn't think any of these
young women capable of murder?

01:04.771 --> 01:06.590
Anyone is capable of murder.

01:13.034 --> 01:14.339
Who would have the most to gain

01:14.362 --> 01:15.672
from Miss Embree's death?

01:15.853 --> 01:17.034
Any one of them.

01:17.185 --> 01:19.230
The Strong's family fortune is...

01:19.460 --> 01:20.407
considerable.

01:20.456 --> 01:23.713
Mrs. Rodney Strong. You
will be the toast of Toronto.

01:23.713 --> 01:25.228
It hasn't happened yet.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.392
I'm hardly decent!

01:29.787 --> 01:31.089
Help!

01:31.288 --> 01:32.443
Help!

01:37.973 --> 01:39.118
You're here.

01:40.079 --> 01:41.774
Don't despair.

01:43.151 --> 01:44.347
Surrender.

01:44.528 --> 01:45.714
It's easier.

01:46.237 --> 01:47.746
It's what you want, isn't it?

01:48.698 --> 01:50.035
It's what we all want.

01:50.318 --> 01:51.682
Freedom.

01:52.153 --> 01:54.316
- Surrender and you can have it.
- No.

01:54.790 --> 01:56.304
No, you're not real.

01:56.424 --> 01:57.595
I'm not real,

01:57.715 --> 01:59.977
but I'm with you every day, aren't I?

02:00.282 --> 02:04.245
So why don't you join me in death

02:04.567 --> 02:07.373
- so I can leave you forever?
- No!

02:07.532 --> 02:09.683
No, no! Help!

02:09.714 --> 02:11.657
- Ah!
- Oh,

02:12.268 --> 02:13.756
that must hurt.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.027
Join me, Julia.

02:17.651 --> 02:19.594
Say goodbye to fear.

02:20.072 --> 02:21.328
Or guilt.

02:21.860 --> 02:24.577
Because that's what you
really feel, isn't it?

02:25.967 --> 02:28.154
Killing me because you were jealous.

02:28.614 --> 02:30.420
That makes you a murderer.

02:31.009 --> 02:33.015
And there's no way out of that.

02:36.786 --> 02:38.843
- Detective Murdoch!
- Where's my wife?

02:38.910 --> 02:40.765
- Inside.
- We were all hurrying out,

02:40.778 --> 02:42.296
- I'm sure she was right behind me.
- Inside?

02:42.318 --> 02:44.713
Where's the bloody fire
department? Murdoch, wait here!

02:44.833 --> 02:45.842
Bloody hell.

02:46.085 --> 02:48.320
We need as much water as we can get!

02:48.338 --> 02:49.839
Off your bloody arses!

02:52.234 --> 02:53.376
Julia!

02:55.966 --> 02:57.369
I'm just trying to
look out for you, Nina.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.118
I've survived 25 years on this Earth

02:59.123 --> 03:00.238
without your help.

03:00.260 --> 03:02.297
I wager I'll survive 25 more.

03:02.328 --> 03:04.075
Are you sure he's not
taking advantage of you?

03:04.195 --> 03:06.732
He's my brother. That's what
family does for each other.

03:07.294 --> 03:08.945
- There's a fire!
- Here?

03:08.971 --> 03:10.638
No, down on Melinda Street.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.513
Oh Lord, that's where Sam's shop is!

03:12.583 --> 03:14.987
My God. Higgins! Round everybody up!

03:20.272 --> 03:21.564
Give me your blanket.

03:23.551 --> 03:24.658
Here.

03:37.371 --> 03:40.072
Help! Help!

03:42.963 --> 03:45.016
Help! Help!

03:46.198 --> 03:47.570
Give her to me.

03:49.178 --> 03:51.037
I got ya. I got ya.

03:51.635 --> 03:53.587
You all, get some
water on this building!

04:07.678 --> 04:08.958
Let's go! Pick it up!

04:08.967 --> 04:10.552
Shake a leg, ladies!

04:18.940 --> 04:20.798
- Samuel! You can't go back in there.
- I have to.

04:20.807 --> 04:22.361
- It's everything I've got.
- No!

04:22.414 --> 04:24.618
- Let me go!
- You can't, it's too dangerous.

04:24.995 --> 04:26.686
George, stop!

04:31.347 --> 04:32.746
Are you all right?

04:35.141 --> 04:36.336
It's alright, Julia.

04:36.823 --> 04:37.934
Surrender.

04:38.244 --> 04:39.890
And it will all be better.

04:44.480 --> 04:45.680
Julia?!

04:52.637 --> 04:53.629
Rodney!

04:54.757 --> 04:57.063
- Elizabeth!
- Rodney!

04:58.316 --> 04:59.244
Are you alright?

04:59.275 --> 05:00.838
- Yes.
- Doctor Ogden is still inside.

05:00.860 --> 05:01.922
- Good Lord.
- Hey, you!

05:01.927 --> 05:03.144
- Sir?
- Lend a hand.

05:03.175 --> 05:05.645
- Oh, of course.
- Grab the empties and refill them.

05:05.672 --> 05:07.555
Excuse me ladies, if you
don't mind pitching in

05:07.595 --> 05:09.100
- and grabbing a bucket.
- Of course.

05:13.641 --> 05:14.592
Join me.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.022
Julia!

05:27.498 --> 05:28.547
Julia!

05:33.146 --> 05:34.226
Julia.

06:08.818 --> 06:10.606
You have any idea how it started?

06:12.129 --> 06:13.608
Were you burning anything in there?

06:13.957 --> 06:15.568
How dare you. I didn't do this.

06:15.590 --> 06:16.936
Take it easy. I'm just asking.

06:22.786 --> 06:23.835
Easy.

06:30.602 --> 06:32.072
We'll take her from here, Detective.

06:32.103 --> 06:33.683
And there's others we need to tend to.

06:33.740 --> 06:35.971
Right. If there's any
change in her condition,

06:35.985 --> 06:37.897
you let me know. For
better or for worse.

06:37.924 --> 06:39.725
- Of course, sir.
- Thank you.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.023
How bad is it?

06:44.143 --> 06:46.413
As far as I know, it's most of the city.

06:55.085 --> 06:57.689
I've heard reports that it
is raging from the Esplanade

06:57.720 --> 06:59.565
in the south to Melinda in the North.

07:02.986 --> 07:05.726
All of Wellington Street
is ablaze, as is Bay.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.151
Over 100 buildings are burning.

07:09.280 --> 07:12.157
It's going to change the
face of the city forever.

07:35.949 --> 07:37.294
Detective Murdoch.

07:37.766 --> 07:39.003
Miss James.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.460
How is she?

07:41.787 --> 07:43.443
Her lungs were thick with smoke

07:43.479 --> 07:44.869
and there are minor burns to her hands,

07:44.869 --> 07:46.245
but she's breathing well.

07:47.609 --> 07:49.008
Thank God.

07:49.694 --> 07:50.920
Were there many killed?

07:51.341 --> 07:52.429
I don't know.

07:52.549 --> 07:55.169
I've heard no reports
of fatalities as of yet.

07:55.381 --> 07:56.382
Detective,

07:56.652 --> 07:59.255
Dr. Ogden said that there
was someone else in there.

07:59.954 --> 08:01.880
There was no one else in the building.

08:02.123 --> 08:03.407
I was in there.

08:03.593 --> 08:05.860
She was convinced she saw Eva Pearce.

08:12.370 --> 08:14.285
Good Lord, is that Canada Mills?

08:14.320 --> 08:17.367
- It was.
- Almost all of Bay Street gone, I heard.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.169
But there's only been one casualty.

08:19.244 --> 08:20.865
A man by the name of John Croft.

08:20.887 --> 08:22.765
Three pumper trucks up from Buffalo.

08:22.929 --> 08:24.699
We should get down there
and lend the lads a hand.

08:24.717 --> 08:27.444
Maybe the Inspector will make
some of his spicy chicken wings.

08:27.678 --> 08:29.059
I think that will remain a treat

08:29.082 --> 08:31.392
only the Inspector will enjoy.

08:31.574 --> 08:33.654
- Ah, sir.
- Morning, lads.

08:33.676 --> 08:35.818
- Stick the kettle on, Higgins.
- Sir.

08:36.145 --> 08:37.691
It seems we're the lucky ones.

08:37.717 --> 08:39.121
All got roofs over our heads.

08:39.134 --> 08:41.121
Evans' parents lost
their entire business.

08:41.139 --> 08:42.370
Bloody shame.

08:42.710 --> 08:44.486
Right. It's gonna get
a little bit crowded

08:44.499 --> 08:46.057
around here the next few days.

08:46.385 --> 08:48.159
The Mayor has deemed
all public buildings

08:48.168 --> 08:49.762
places of temporary refuge.

08:50.041 --> 08:51.594
So we'll be taking in boarders.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.922
He's also allocated money for
the purchase of cots and supplies.

08:54.949 --> 08:56.732
You need a promissory
note for any merchant

08:56.733 --> 08:58.008
who is still in operation.

08:58.446 --> 08:59.628
Right, let's get to it.

09:00.053 --> 09:01.633
Let's try and make our guests' stay

09:01.646 --> 09:03.554
- as comfortable as possible.
- Sir.

09:05.063 --> 09:07.293
- Crack on, Higgins.
- Sir,

09:07.462 --> 09:09.923
I was just curious as to
whether there'd been word of

09:10.043 --> 09:11.438
how the blaze started?

09:11.473 --> 09:12.987
They're still investigating.

09:14.390 --> 09:16.227
What do you mean no telegrams?

09:17.077 --> 09:18.113
Check again.

09:18.286 --> 09:19.999
I should have a reply by now.

09:20.314 --> 09:21.270
What is it?

09:21.815 --> 09:24.307
Sir, I wired Scotland Yard days ago,

09:24.379 --> 09:26.264
and I still haven't received word back.

09:26.282 --> 09:27.982
The telegraph lines have been destroyed.

09:27.999 --> 09:30.319
It will be a few days before
normal service is resumed.

09:30.863 --> 09:33.002
Not that they're out number
one priority at the moment.

09:33.122 --> 09:35.451
- Of course.
- How's Doctor Ogden?

09:35.849 --> 09:38.372
- Recovering.
- Still, a close bloody call.

09:39.612 --> 09:41.808
Your telegram likely
doesn't matter much anyway.

09:41.839 --> 09:43.193
Given that Lady Atherly and her daughter

09:43.210 --> 09:44.768
were the intended firebomb target,

09:44.799 --> 09:47.341
I'll wager that they're
clear for the first murders.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.156
I would have to agree
with your assessment there.

09:50.187 --> 09:51.984
Do you think that was
the cause of the fire?

09:52.033 --> 09:53.551
Not according to the fire department.

09:53.569 --> 09:55.393
The firebomb was a secondary blaze.

09:56.407 --> 09:58.591
A coincidence or a clever cover?

09:58.846 --> 10:00.988
We'll have to catch the
bugger before we find that out.

10:01.001 --> 10:01.997
Right.

10:02.281 --> 10:04.630
Would you like to see the debutantes?

10:05.117 --> 10:06.640
Thought you'd never ask.

10:10.641 --> 10:13.386
Ridiculous. I was at
my parents' summer home.

10:14.076 --> 10:16.162
You can talk to the staff.

10:16.710 --> 10:18.078
You weren't sticking around to see

10:18.087 --> 10:19.472
if you'd become the blushing bride?

10:20.057 --> 10:21.783
I wasn't going to become that.

10:21.863 --> 10:23.590
It was clear Rodney Strong

10:23.612 --> 10:25.852
was going to pick that English tart.

10:27.879 --> 10:28.831
Right.

10:29.397 --> 10:31.106
Where were you during the fire?

10:31.305 --> 10:32.462
I was trapped in the lobby

10:32.470 --> 10:34.387
of the Belvedere Arms
when the blaze broke out.

10:34.454 --> 10:37.854
- Can anyone confirm this?
- I was with my parents.

10:37.885 --> 10:39.956
They've hardly let me out of their sight

10:40.027 --> 10:41.983
since the other girls
started getting murdered.

10:47.556 --> 10:49.805
The doctor insisted I accompany her.

10:52.266 --> 10:53.625
Miss Fairhurst?

10:54.789 --> 10:55.838
Miss Fairhurst,

10:57.622 --> 10:59.623
- were you...
- What's wrong with her?

11:00.003 --> 11:01.713
She's been this way since the fire.

11:01.833 --> 11:04.395
She was in Brown Brothers
Stationary when it started.

11:05.474 --> 11:08.923
Miss Fairhurst, were you on
Melinda Street at all yesterday?

11:09.278 --> 11:10.371
Is it over?

11:10.720 --> 11:14.218
- Excuse me?
- The fire. Is it over? Can I go home?

11:20.344 --> 11:21.805
You may have to face the fact

11:21.805 --> 11:23.372
that we're looking
at this the wrong way.

11:23.385 --> 11:25.496
The killer may not be one
of the debutantes after all.

11:25.563 --> 11:28.377
Rodney Strong's fortune
is a compelling motive.

11:28.418 --> 11:30.468
It is, but none of
them could have done it.

11:30.963 --> 11:33.084
I've been thinking, Murdoch,

11:33.270 --> 11:35.382
there may be a reason
more twisted than that.

11:36.484 --> 11:37.837
A sequential killer?

11:38.836 --> 11:40.640
It might be best to consult your wife.

11:40.676 --> 11:42.585
I'd rather not.

11:42.913 --> 11:46.002
- Fair enough.
- I'm concerned about her, sir.

11:49.304 --> 11:50.892
She's been having...

11:51.100 --> 11:52.260
delusions.

11:53.681 --> 11:55.203
- Delusions?
- Yes, sir.

11:55.243 --> 11:56.957
Visions of Eva Pearce.

11:57.293 --> 11:59.250
That's why she went into the fire.

11:59.281 --> 12:02.844
Either to save her or to kill herself.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.815
- The doctor wouldn't do that.
- Sir, she very nearly did.

12:07.479 --> 12:10.095
Murdoch, perhaps the
doctor can't heal herself.

12:10.382 --> 12:12.264
Are you suggesting a psychiatrist?

12:12.869 --> 12:14.887
It's just that I thought you considered

12:14.901 --> 12:16.959
that field of study to be bunk.

12:16.999 --> 12:18.579
Maybe I'm evolving, Murdoch.

12:18.907 --> 12:20.655
But if it is a sequential killer,

12:20.669 --> 12:22.120
we need the doctor's help.

12:26.553 --> 12:28.148
One good thing about this.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.560
I can give my sister
her precious money back.

12:30.857 --> 12:33.207
Might save me from being
threatened by policemen.

12:33.327 --> 12:35.203
I apologize for that.

12:35.529 --> 12:37.380
My tools and my supplies are all gone.

12:37.447 --> 12:39.462
And soon enough, I will be as well.

12:39.864 --> 12:40.750
Where?

12:43.052 --> 12:44.371
Are you sure?

12:44.995 --> 12:45.943
I mean,

12:46.390 --> 12:48.354
I think you've got a
really good idea here.

12:48.391 --> 12:50.078
More and more people are
buying autos every day

12:50.100 --> 12:51.591
and nobody knows how to fix them.

12:51.711 --> 12:53.021
That's what I thought, too.

12:54.194 --> 12:55.575
Maybe you need a partner?

12:56.443 --> 12:57.891
I've got some savings.

12:58.285 --> 12:59.639
You trust me with your money?

13:00.581 --> 13:01.679
We'll see.

13:03.162 --> 13:05.092
You doing this to get
in good with my sister?

13:05.123 --> 13:06.907
I'm already in good with your sister.

13:07.327 --> 13:08.726
I'm doing this because I honestly think

13:08.748 --> 13:10.006
you have a solid idea.

13:10.218 --> 13:11.865
You be wanting your name on the sign?

13:12.635 --> 13:14.308
I hadn't thought of that.

13:14.667 --> 13:16.451
But I like the idea, sure.

13:16.619 --> 13:18.456
Crabtree and Bloom.

13:24.100 --> 13:25.655
You saved us.

13:26.225 --> 13:27.901
Both my daughter and me.

13:29.822 --> 13:32.031
Why did you go back into the blaze?

13:33.220 --> 13:35.385
I thought that there
was someone in there.

13:35.420 --> 13:36.955
We were alone.

13:38.366 --> 13:40.058
I heard someone.

13:41.264 --> 13:43.096
Detective Murdoch.

13:43.216 --> 13:45.558
- Lady Atherly.
- Oh please,

13:45.763 --> 13:47.551
after everything we've been through,

13:47.728 --> 13:48.895
Suzanne.

13:51.136 --> 13:53.515
I was hoping to have
a word with my wife.

13:53.559 --> 13:54.826
Of course.

13:55.773 --> 13:59.015
We owe her a great
deal, Elizabeth and I.

14:00.969 --> 14:03.243
- Goodbye, Julia.
- Goodbye.

14:04.078 --> 14:05.611
I'll see myself out.

14:05.731 --> 14:06.978
Thank you.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.311
How are you?

14:14.287 --> 14:16.284
I can breathe.

14:16.467 --> 14:17.502
Good.

14:17.528 --> 14:19.029
Good.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.050
Julia...

14:25.653 --> 14:28.226
When Miss James was attending to you,

14:28.346 --> 14:32.399
you told her that you saw
Eva Pearce in the fire.

14:37.580 --> 14:39.686
Julia, please answer me.

14:45.491 --> 14:47.649
I didn't have to kill her that day.

14:50.526 --> 14:53.220
The truth is, I think
that I wanted to kill her.

14:54.753 --> 14:57.121
I'm no better than the people you catch.

14:57.241 --> 14:59.660
The people you hunt down.

14:59.682 --> 15:02.383
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I'm not being ridiculous.

15:03.472 --> 15:04.923
I wanted her dead.

15:05.393 --> 15:06.975
And I murdered her.

15:08.381 --> 15:09.930
It wasn't murder.

15:09.980 --> 15:11.120
I was there.

15:12.309 --> 15:13.946
Eva!

15:16.702 --> 15:18.921
The truth is if you hadn't killed her,

15:18.949 --> 15:21.173
she surely would have killed you.

15:23.093 --> 15:24.377
You were free.

15:25.284 --> 15:26.618
You would have stopped her.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.383
I may have.

15:28.836 --> 15:30.906
But I can't say that I would have

15:30.923 --> 15:33.839
in time to save you. Not for certain.

15:36.118 --> 15:37.424
Still...

15:38.404 --> 15:41.904
Julia, you did what any
normal person would have done.

15:43.244 --> 15:45.211
You were fighting for your own life.

15:45.246 --> 15:46.795
It wasn't murder.

15:47.314 --> 15:48.856
It was instinct.

15:54.121 --> 15:56.078
I should rest.

16:07.725 --> 16:10.497
I hope you don't turn out to
be like every other man in here.

16:10.834 --> 16:11.935
How's that?

16:12.174 --> 16:14.210
Just another one trying to buy me.

16:14.861 --> 16:16.033
Hardly.

16:16.967 --> 16:18.818
I think getting involved
in your brother's business

16:18.827 --> 16:20.084
is just a smart idea.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.956
I thought he was a criminal?

16:22.421 --> 16:25.807
In my experience, criminals often
have good ideas, it's just the

16:26.086 --> 16:27.734
execution that's lacking.

16:28.079 --> 16:29.354
So you trust him?

16:29.747 --> 16:31.664
I think he deserves a second chance.

16:32.434 --> 16:33.810
Besides,

16:34.589 --> 16:36.616
I don't need to buy your affections.

16:37.882 --> 16:39.281
Is that so?

16:39.706 --> 16:42.433
I reckon, most nights, you can
hardly wait to give them to me.

16:57.983 --> 17:00.781
- Oh. You should stay in bed.
- No.

17:00.839 --> 17:03.450
- I'm feeling a little better.
- Good.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.017
Very good.

17:07.186 --> 17:08.598
Simon Reynolds?

17:09.568 --> 17:11.099
Yes, he did jail time

17:11.117 --> 17:13.862
for viciously assaulting
women in the Rosedale Valley.

17:14.065 --> 17:15.526
Joseph Tilton?

17:16.701 --> 17:19.031
Three counts of violating.

17:19.732 --> 17:21.662
Why are you investigating these men?

17:23.321 --> 17:25.959
I now have to be open to the idea

17:25.973 --> 17:27.743
that the person responsible
for these murders

17:27.752 --> 17:29.594
could be a sequential killer.

17:30.324 --> 17:32.666
The methods of murder
are quite different...

17:33.299 --> 17:35.087
a knife, a gun,

17:35.132 --> 17:36.637
and a bomb.

17:36.757 --> 17:37.717
Yes.

17:37.788 --> 17:41.218
But the characteristics of
the victims are identical.

17:41.467 --> 17:44.986
All young women, rich,
traveled in the same circles.

17:45.195 --> 17:48.330
So you think the killer hates
them because of their privilege.

17:49.125 --> 17:50.465
Possibly.

17:51.643 --> 17:54.118
So it could be either a man or a woman.

17:54.649 --> 17:57.310
A young girl angry she's been denied

17:57.323 --> 17:59.169
the life her victims enjoyed,

17:59.647 --> 18:01.396
or a man who hates them because

18:01.418 --> 18:03.197
he thinks they don't
deserve what they have.

18:04.303 --> 18:06.109
Your theory is reasonable.

18:06.733 --> 18:09.540
Thank you, but it was suggested
to me by the Inspector.

18:09.753 --> 18:11.077
He doesn't seem to think that

18:11.090 --> 18:13.485
this has anything to do with Mr. Strong.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.330
And you agree with him?

18:15.384 --> 18:17.008
Oh, I don't know, Julia.

18:17.043 --> 18:19.819
Every step I take leads to a dead end.

18:21.085 --> 18:23.574
But I can't help thinking
that the murders are

18:23.613 --> 18:25.304
because of him.

18:34.870 --> 18:38.141
- Ta-da!
- Detective Murdoch!

18:38.619 --> 18:41.094
Julia! Greetings! I have news!

18:41.125 --> 18:42.940
Wondrous news!

18:43.002 --> 18:45.662
- Oh. Would you like a seat?
- No, no, no, no, no.

18:45.782 --> 18:47.783
No. I am here to present

18:47.822 --> 18:50.780
the City of Toronto's newest couple,

18:50.806 --> 18:53.976
Mr. and Mrs. Rodney Strong!

18:54.321 --> 18:57.525
Let us all toast the blessed union.

18:59.486 --> 19:00.628
Oops.

19:04.603 --> 19:07.330
Well, this is certainly a whirlwind.

19:07.530 --> 19:09.888
I was operating under
a tight time frame.

19:09.901 --> 19:10.844
Rodney!

19:10.898 --> 19:12.044
It wouldn't have mattered.

19:12.783 --> 19:14.836
From the moment I laid
eyes on her, I knew.

19:15.895 --> 19:18.907
Who knew that true
love could strike twice?

19:19.027 --> 19:21.751
Detective, Ruth was a mere trifle,

19:22.357 --> 19:23.588
a first love.

19:24.115 --> 19:26.076
Dear, sad girl. This...

19:27.023 --> 19:30.251
- this is different.
- Don't let the Detective upset you.

19:30.371 --> 19:33.112
I know first-hand
he's a suspicious sort.

19:33.150 --> 19:35.164
Isn't that right? Besides,

19:35.192 --> 19:37.715
his wife is the reason
you two are married.

19:37.835 --> 19:41.361
- If she hadn't saved Elizabeth's life...
- Yes. Thank you, Doctor Ogden.

19:41.395 --> 19:43.652
- I hardly...
- Oh, look at the time.

19:44.172 --> 19:45.910
We're expected elsewhere.

19:45.943 --> 19:47.520
Let's hurry along.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.423
Would you like to come with us?

19:49.445 --> 19:51.863
Some of Rodney's friends are
throwing a fabulous party.

19:51.874 --> 19:54.010
You go on. And congratulations.

20:02.083 --> 20:03.195
Thank you.

20:06.343 --> 20:07.505
What is it?

20:07.732 --> 20:10.504
- It's likely nothing.
- Go on.

20:11.007 --> 20:13.961
Lady Atherly seems overly grateful.

20:14.321 --> 20:16.622
- You did save her life.
- So she says.

20:16.645 --> 20:18.212
But the two of them were scant feet

20:18.229 --> 20:20.138
from the door when the blaze started.

20:20.143 --> 20:22.810
I hardly think they needed me to escape.

20:33.405 --> 20:34.822
Be very careful.

20:45.944 --> 20:48.240
Do you recall where
everyone was standing?

20:49.828 --> 20:51.384
I was standing over there.

20:51.567 --> 20:54.046
And the two of them were
standing right there.

20:56.600 --> 20:59.968
So they could have seen the person
with the firebomb approaching.

21:01.189 --> 21:03.663
If they were looking in that direction.

21:04.007 --> 21:06.296
Well, say they were.

21:07.502 --> 21:09.688
If they'd known that they were coming,

21:09.713 --> 21:12.266
they could easily
have escaped from here.

21:12.682 --> 21:15.426
Why would they willingly
put themselves in danger?

21:16.057 --> 21:19.422
It's better to appear as a potential
victim than a potential murderer.

21:19.456 --> 21:21.413
So you think Suzanne
Atherly and her daughter

21:21.458 --> 21:23.577
are murdering all the
debutantes in Toronto?

21:23.697 --> 21:26.798
Julia, all I know is
that Elizabeth Atherly

21:26.829 --> 21:29.459
is now married to one of
the city's wealthiest men.

21:29.769 --> 21:32.967
A family that was facing
penury is now set for life.

21:33.002 --> 21:34.884
Something that wasn't entirely possible

21:34.904 --> 21:36.973
when those other girls were still alive.

21:40.409 --> 21:43.225
I know it's not ideal,
but I'm sure the Mayor is

21:43.231 --> 21:46.340
working quickly to secure
more suitable lodgings.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.117
Where will the children sleep?

21:48.598 --> 21:50.618
In here as well, I'm afraid.

21:52.411 --> 21:54.182
Next to the people they don't know?

21:54.490 --> 21:56.550
Well, I'm sure they'll
get to know them in time.

21:56.561 --> 21:58.387
Become one big happy family.

21:58.437 --> 22:00.627
Higgins, get off your backside

22:00.649 --> 22:03.003
- and look useful for once in your life!
- Sir.

22:05.249 --> 22:07.828
Ah. Sir. This is arrived for you.

22:08.010 --> 22:10.373
Apparently they've
restored telegraph service.

22:10.539 --> 22:11.767
Apparently.

22:12.293 --> 22:13.526
Thank you.

22:16.199 --> 22:18.210
All of this is already known to you.

22:18.330 --> 22:19.812
Not all.

22:20.747 --> 22:23.497
You never mentioned a
man named Trevor Cross.

22:24.233 --> 22:25.473
And why would I?

22:25.545 --> 22:28.254
He caused your family
considerable embarrassment.

22:28.810 --> 22:30.923
All the more reason
for not mentioning him.

22:30.958 --> 22:33.015
He was in a relationship
with your daughter.

22:34.210 --> 22:36.795
A gardener with a member
of the aristocracy...

22:36.830 --> 22:39.076
An affair I had swiftly terminated.

22:39.475 --> 22:42.029
You must see how this looks to me.

22:42.534 --> 22:44.800
Your daughter is in a scandalous affair,

22:44.823 --> 22:46.482
your family a laughingstock,

22:46.509 --> 22:48.049
and you were destitute.

22:48.270 --> 22:49.774
You light out to Canada.

22:49.809 --> 22:51.568
To start a new life.

22:52.374 --> 22:53.609
Many people do.

22:53.657 --> 22:56.654
And two murders later, she
has a wealthy new husband.

22:56.685 --> 22:57.588
Yes,

22:57.632 --> 22:59.984
she is now a respectable married woman.

23:02.077 --> 23:03.955
Do you plan on arresting her for that?

23:04.919 --> 23:05.778
No,

23:06.132 --> 23:09.807
but I do plan on fully
exploring how that came to be.

23:10.630 --> 23:12.042
I know all of this.

23:12.529 --> 23:13.857
Elizabeth told me.

23:15.044 --> 23:16.372
Told you what?

23:16.625 --> 23:19.241
Told me she was involved
with a disreputable character

23:19.254 --> 23:22.087
while she was in England. It
was a youthful indiscretion.

23:23.309 --> 23:25.212
And her financial situation?

23:25.261 --> 23:28.995
She made clear to me her
family's diminished fortune.

23:30.326 --> 23:31.264
Oh.

23:31.609 --> 23:34.232
- I see.
- No, I'm not sure you do, Detective.

23:34.234 --> 23:35.761
And I will make it plain.

23:36.088 --> 23:37.389
Her frankness in these matters

23:37.402 --> 23:38.947
is one of the reasons why I married her.

23:39.483 --> 23:41.540
More than her family name, her honesty

23:41.549 --> 23:43.276
bespeaks her character.

23:43.862 --> 23:44.653
Now,

23:45.330 --> 23:46.273
is that all?

23:47.716 --> 23:50.116
I wish you all the
happiness in the world.

23:50.306 --> 23:51.275
Thank you.

23:51.709 --> 23:54.170
I feel that I've had more than
my fair share of the other.

24:07.737 --> 24:09.171
Help me!

24:17.874 --> 24:19.557
So does this mean you'll be spending

24:19.579 --> 24:21.075
all of your free time with my brother?

24:21.098 --> 24:22.155
I shouldn't say.

24:22.204 --> 24:24.151
He's nowhere near as
good looking as you.

24:57.966 --> 25:01.082
So, Constable, this is your lucky day.

25:01.264 --> 25:03.438
I've decided to give
you a chance at my heart.

25:03.455 --> 25:06.479
- Among other things.
- I'm sorry. I can't.

25:06.930 --> 25:07.970
Henry?

25:07.996 --> 25:09.165
I just can't.

25:14.327 --> 25:16.828
I thought you said your
friend was interested in me.

25:18.153 --> 25:19.843
I thought he was.

25:21.671 --> 25:23.920
Help!

25:25.027 --> 25:26.833
Somebody please!

25:28.019 --> 25:29.196
Help!

25:38.193 --> 25:39.171
Thank you.

25:47.560 --> 25:49.330
She would have died quickly.

25:50.582 --> 25:53.336
You think it could've been the
same knife as the other victim?

25:53.668 --> 25:56.156
- It's too early to tell.
- Of course.

25:57.604 --> 25:58.746
Did you know her?

25:59.007 --> 26:00.451
I interviewed her.

26:00.459 --> 26:02.314
She was one of the debutantes.

26:02.706 --> 26:04.687
Hasn't Mr. Strong already married?

26:04.904 --> 26:06.134
He has.

26:07.210 --> 26:08.425
Then why kill her?

26:08.985 --> 26:10.260
Isn't it too late?

26:11.301 --> 26:15.041
Perhaps someone was jealous
of their good fortune.

26:17.219 --> 26:19.131
It doesn't make any sense.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.809
Sir, I have somebody
you should speak with.

26:35.933 --> 26:37.615
This is Colin Dunn.

26:37.881 --> 26:39.735
Detective William
Murdoch, Toronto Constab...

26:39.748 --> 26:42.170
I've been around Toronto long
enough to know who you are.

26:42.369 --> 26:44.714
- Ah.
- Mr. Dunn saw the victim, sir.

26:45.024 --> 26:46.139
Erma Fairhurst.

26:46.166 --> 26:47.630
If that's her name, I saw her.

26:47.639 --> 26:48.799
- When?
- Last night.

26:48.821 --> 26:51.026
Saw her leaving the Biltmore
Hotel in quite a hurry.

26:51.039 --> 26:52.385
She was upset, you see, and...

26:52.411 --> 26:55.355
- Let the man speak, George.
- Well, she was crying.

26:55.519 --> 26:57.081
At least that's what
it looked like to me.

26:57.316 --> 26:59.330
Whether she was upset, who could tell?

26:59.706 --> 27:01.739
Most women cry at the drop of a hat.

27:01.774 --> 27:03.243
Many men, also.

27:05.733 --> 27:08.023
Did you happen to see
anyone following her?

27:08.032 --> 27:09.028
I did not,

27:09.036 --> 27:11.387
but I did not lag, I had work to do.

27:11.507 --> 27:12.587
And like I said,

27:13.463 --> 27:15.491
- a crying woman...
- Yes,

27:15.792 --> 27:16.810
of course.

27:17.368 --> 27:18.284
Thank you, sir.

27:20.803 --> 27:22.627
- Very interesting.
- What's that?

27:22.747 --> 27:24.295
This gentleman saw the victim

27:24.317 --> 27:25.866
leaving the Biltmore Hotel.

27:25.941 --> 27:28.394
That's where the bachelor and
his new bride are staying, sir.

27:28.394 --> 27:29.324
According to Madge Merton,

27:29.355 --> 27:31.021
they're occupying the entire top floor.

27:31.023 --> 27:32.528
You think it's the bloody bachelor.

27:32.648 --> 27:33.706
- Go on.
- Well, sir,

27:33.728 --> 27:35.167
he knows all of the victims,

27:35.189 --> 27:36.889
he was on site for all of the murders,

27:36.955 --> 27:38.597
and he was at the fire.

27:38.717 --> 27:40.235
Still, nothing concrete.

27:40.943 --> 27:44.104
This man says he saw the
latest victim leaving his hotel.

27:44.117 --> 27:45.928
With all of these "circumstances"...

27:46.181 --> 27:47.823
I'd have a word.

27:49.275 --> 27:51.103
She was here, what of it?

27:51.621 --> 27:52.732
Why?

27:54.254 --> 27:56.263
She asked me to annul my marriage.

27:56.949 --> 27:59.084
But it's a little late
for that now, I'm afraid.

28:00.832 --> 28:03.501
She wanted you to end your marriage?

28:03.545 --> 28:04.962
For what reason?

28:05.547 --> 28:07.489
She said she was in love with me.

28:08.290 --> 28:09.365
I said I was sorry;

28:09.383 --> 28:11.689
she told me these shocking
lies about Elizabeth.

28:12.398 --> 28:14.660
- Would you care to share those?
- I would not.

28:15.133 --> 28:17.192
And I very much doubt
you can compel me to.

28:17.510 --> 28:18.440
As far as I'm concerned,

28:18.448 --> 28:20.100
she is a spoiled brat spreading scandal

28:20.117 --> 28:21.348
because she didn't get what she wanted.

28:21.861 --> 28:23.388
I'm done with her.
You can tell her that.

28:24.398 --> 28:26.594
She's dead, Mr. Strong.

28:27.165 --> 28:29.278
She's... she's dead?

28:29.494 --> 28:31.663
We found her body in
an alley last night.

28:31.669 --> 28:34.849
- Her throat had been slit.
- Oh, that's horrible.

28:36.121 --> 28:37.577
Does her family know?

28:37.627 --> 28:38.939
They've been notified.

28:41.827 --> 28:44.971
Well, I apologize for what
I said about her, but she...

28:45.091 --> 28:48.167
- she upset me terribly.
- Where were you last night, Mr. Strong?

28:48.189 --> 28:49.265
I...

28:51.253 --> 28:52.735
I was with my wife.

28:53.137 --> 28:56.389
- Can she confirm this?
- I would certainly say so.

28:57.075 --> 28:59.382
- I'd like to speak with her.
- She's not in.

28:59.631 --> 29:00.649
Well then,

29:00.672 --> 29:03.676
- would you mind if I examined your hotel suite?
- You may not.

29:05.856 --> 29:09.237
- Mr. Strong, what are you hiding?
- Nothing.

29:09.774 --> 29:12.479
But I will not have you
examining my marriage bed.

29:16.414 --> 29:18.849
Very well. I'll be back.

29:20.984 --> 29:23.574
If you wish to enter I'll
need to see a judge's warrant.

29:24.565 --> 29:25.876
Of course.

29:34.463 --> 29:35.930
Sir?

29:38.713 --> 29:39.964
Sir!

29:42.614 --> 29:44.020
Sir?!

29:54.672 --> 29:56.786
Rodney Strong has just left.

29:56.906 --> 29:58.175
Follow him.

29:59.846 --> 30:01.058
Sir.

30:21.902 --> 30:23.047
You're leaving?

30:23.080 --> 30:25.925
My daughter is now a
respectable married woman.

30:25.960 --> 30:28.071
My work here is done, don't you think?

30:28.248 --> 30:29.460
And Elizabeth?

30:29.532 --> 30:31.042
We're all going home.

30:31.162 --> 30:33.239
Her, Rodney and me.

30:33.627 --> 30:37.483
Thank you for your
generosity and hospitality.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.791
Allow me to accompany
you to the train station.

30:39.973 --> 30:43.139
- I'll just be a moment.
- Julia, that certainly isn't necessary.

30:43.172 --> 30:45.285
Nonsense. What sort
of hostess would I be

30:45.285 --> 30:46.679
if I didn't see you off?

31:24.734 --> 31:26.984
Patience.

31:36.957 --> 31:38.595
The train will be here shortly.

31:38.650 --> 31:41.107
- There's no need to stay.
- Nonsense.

31:41.649 --> 31:43.768
- Look, there he is.
- Rodney!

31:44.565 --> 31:46.048
Lady Atherly.

31:46.472 --> 31:49.139
Please. It's Mother now.

31:49.982 --> 31:51.399
Doctor Ogden,

31:51.687 --> 31:53.519
I must apologize for our rather

31:53.536 --> 31:55.417
obnoxious behavior the other evening.

31:55.461 --> 31:58.322
One never need apologize
for high spirits. And again,

31:58.361 --> 32:00.269
- congratulations, Mr. Strong.
- Thank you.

32:00.389 --> 32:01.774
Where's Elizabeth?

32:02.029 --> 32:04.187
She said she would meet me here shortly.

32:05.427 --> 32:07.037
This is all quite exciting.

32:07.690 --> 32:09.908
I have never been overseas before.

32:26.477 --> 32:28.175
We'll be together soon enough.

32:43.984 --> 32:45.760
I kissed a man's wife.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.802
I don't think you can
arrest me for that.

32:47.922 --> 32:50.153
From the looks of things
you've done far more

32:50.186 --> 32:51.725
than that, Mr. Bishop.

32:52.007 --> 32:53.313
Goodbye, Doctor Ogden.

32:53.379 --> 32:55.205
- Safe travels.
- No one's going anywhere.

32:55.515 --> 32:56.821
I'd like a word with you two.

32:56.843 --> 32:58.536
I think we've spoken enough.

32:58.580 --> 33:01.103
This time we'll be
discussing the truth. George,

33:01.142 --> 33:03.377
- arrest them.
- Take your hands off me.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.049
My God!

33:06.449 --> 33:08.035
Trevor Cross!

33:08.909 --> 33:12.080
- What the hell are you doing here!
- Ma'am! Ma'am!

33:12.200 --> 33:13.651
Let him go!

33:14.066 --> 33:16.124
Everybody down!

33:21.386 --> 33:22.902
Let go of him.

33:28.711 --> 33:30.714
- Let him go.
- Elizabeth...

33:30.731 --> 33:32.170
You would kill your own mother?

33:32.187 --> 33:34.482
- Elizabeth?
- I said let go of him!

33:34.987 --> 33:36.719
Let him go.

33:38.749 --> 33:41.028
Elizabeth, she's your mother.

33:41.073 --> 33:44.258
- Who tried to ruin my life.
- We need a carriage. Now.

33:44.287 --> 33:46.838
All I wanted was to be with
him, and she wouldn't let me.

33:46.849 --> 33:48.514
- Get us the carriage!
- Ah!

33:48.549 --> 33:50.081
Yes, yes, you'll have it.

33:51.249 --> 33:53.091
- Let her go.
- We'll let her go

33:53.102 --> 33:54.690
when we're good and ready.

33:58.734 --> 34:00.615
He doesn't love you.

34:02.458 --> 34:04.328
What man would allow
you to marry another

34:04.350 --> 34:05.897
if he truly loved you?

34:06.657 --> 34:09.003
He is using you more
than your mother ever did.

34:09.031 --> 34:10.335
That's not true.

34:10.603 --> 34:12.449
He killed them, didn't he?

34:13.070 --> 34:14.226
Elizabeth,

34:14.641 --> 34:16.860
you're not a murderer.
You're just desperate.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.376
And all that money,

34:19.699 --> 34:21.242
he'll likely kill you next.

34:21.292 --> 34:23.179
- Don't listen to her.
- Why, Mr. Bishop?

34:23.206 --> 34:25.420
- Because it's true?
- Let me go,

34:26.317 --> 34:27.650
please.

34:29.061 --> 34:30.179
Elizabeth.

34:30.665 --> 34:31.949
I love you,

34:32.487 --> 34:33.674
no matter what he did.

34:33.676 --> 34:35.984
Don't listen to them. Listen to me.

34:36.022 --> 34:37.516
If you kill her,

34:37.699 --> 34:40.139
you'll never be the
person you once were.

34:40.504 --> 34:42.618
You'll be changed forever, believe me.

34:42.878 --> 34:44.869
You're not a murderer, Elizabeth.

34:45.034 --> 34:46.701
You know that.

34:51.309 --> 34:53.063
Ah!

34:58.066 --> 34:59.333
Bastard.

35:03.743 --> 35:05.757
All right, get up.

35:11.247 --> 35:14.135
- It was easy.
- The poor man fell for me.

35:15.701 --> 35:18.003
Why did he agree to
go to England with you?

35:18.351 --> 35:20.802
He still felt he could win my heart.

35:21.621 --> 35:24.510
Even after he found out
about you and Trevor?

35:24.537 --> 35:26.192
He didn't find out.

35:26.396 --> 35:28.277
I told him about Trevor.

35:29.136 --> 35:31.232
After the marriage was
consummated, of course.

35:32.805 --> 35:35.251
And he still wanted to be with you?

35:36.705 --> 35:39.228
It's amazing what men
will believe possible.

35:40.164 --> 35:42.200
And why did you let him come?

35:43.578 --> 35:46.670
Well, there was no reason to kill him.

35:48.586 --> 35:49.947
And there was the matter

35:49.969 --> 35:51.911
of changing his will, of course.

35:52.951 --> 35:54.373
There was that.

35:56.526 --> 35:58.357
I'll be charging you with murder.

35:58.477 --> 35:59.475
What?

36:00.062 --> 36:01.932
No, I was duplicitous.

36:02.148 --> 36:04.063
But I didn't murder any of them.

36:04.504 --> 36:07.409
That would contradict
Mr. Cross's statements.

36:13.865 --> 36:16.173
He's agreed to sign my report.

36:24.172 --> 36:25.710
This is a lie.

36:26.656 --> 36:29.578
This is a lie. He killed them, not me.

36:29.982 --> 36:33.197
No, he killed Ruth as she was
the only one standing in my way.

36:33.496 --> 36:36.362
- And Faye Sloane?
- She was too nosy.

36:36.561 --> 36:38.907
He said it was only a matter of time

36:38.913 --> 36:40.860
before she found out about us.

36:41.060 --> 36:42.897
And what of poor Erma?

36:43.366 --> 36:47.007
She was killed long after you'd
already gotten what you wanted.

36:48.208 --> 36:50.498
She saw Trevor and I together.

36:56.411 --> 36:59.211
You knew of all of these murders?

37:00.391 --> 37:02.028
Yes, I did.

37:03.350 --> 37:05.375
And yet you did nothing.

37:07.074 --> 37:08.347
No.

37:08.662 --> 37:12.026
Hardly the actions of
a desperate woman, hmm?

37:17.670 --> 37:18.887
Um...

37:19.252 --> 37:20.840
Detective Murdoch?

37:23.916 --> 37:26.412
My mother knew nothing of this.

37:40.429 --> 37:42.431
Mr. Cross returned to Canada

37:42.453 --> 37:46.162
after the dissolution of his
relationship with your daughter.

37:47.157 --> 37:49.027
He befriended Mr. Strong

37:49.054 --> 37:52.020
and knew of the necessity that he marry.

37:53.895 --> 37:56.958
When he learned that you and your
daughter were immigrating to...

37:56.958 --> 37:59.773
He killed them all so
that Elizabeth could marry.

38:04.191 --> 38:06.178
Did Elizabeth know of this?

38:06.726 --> 38:08.484
I'm afraid so.

38:10.476 --> 38:12.393
Will she be executed?

38:13.464 --> 38:15.421
That's not for me to say.

38:16.227 --> 38:18.590
But she'll most certainly be imprisoned.

38:20.299 --> 38:21.999
This is all my fault.

38:24.717 --> 38:26.700
You tried to give her a better life.

38:28.984 --> 38:31.529
I should have let her choose her own.

38:45.460 --> 38:47.054
Ladies and gentlemen,

38:47.372 --> 38:49.023
the Mayor wanted to pass on the news

38:49.046 --> 38:50.148
that as of tomorrow,

38:50.174 --> 38:51.763
you'll be rehoused in the Armoury.

38:52.303 --> 38:55.159
Enjoy your final evening here
at Station House 4. Thank you.

39:09.897 --> 39:12.004
- Sir.
- What is it, Higgins?

39:15.943 --> 39:18.258
Sir, I'm placing myself in your custody.

39:18.338 --> 39:19.329
Bloody hell.

39:19.692 --> 39:22.663
You'd better have a seat
and I'd better have a drink.

39:24.035 --> 39:25.606
So why am I arresting you?

39:25.655 --> 39:29.059
Because I am a scoundrel,
sir, and a coward.

39:29.360 --> 39:30.866
And you have been for years.

39:31.039 --> 39:32.676
So what brings you here now?

39:34.819 --> 39:36.036
I started it.

39:36.713 --> 39:38.145
Started what?

39:38.497 --> 39:39.883
The fire, sir.

39:40.091 --> 39:41.530
The fire that has caused

39:41.650 --> 39:44.287
all these good people such
distress, sir. It was me.

39:44.310 --> 39:46.328
And how in God's name
did you do that, Higgins?

39:46.797 --> 39:48.506
My cigar started it, sir.

39:51.932 --> 39:53.473
I hardly think it's funny, sir.

39:54.008 --> 39:55.752
You didn't start the fire, Higgins.

39:55.965 --> 39:57.833
The fire department
have released a report.

39:57.851 --> 39:59.360
They believe it was a faulty stove.

40:00.963 --> 40:03.044
- So it wasn't me?
- I'm afraid you won't be able to add

40:03.070 --> 40:04.872
"starting the Great Fire of Toronto"

40:04.876 --> 40:06.322
to the list of your accomplishments.

40:06.442 --> 40:09.250
Thank you, sir!

40:12.565 --> 40:14.278
- Higgins.
- Sir.

40:15.517 --> 40:17.780
Good lad, coming forward like that.

40:18.086 --> 40:19.192
Thank you, sir.

40:19.626 --> 40:21.470
Now if you don't mind,

40:21.733 --> 40:23.671
there's a woman I need to apologize to.

40:23.791 --> 40:25.061
Apologies to both a woman

40:25.065 --> 40:26.769
and for doing something you didn't do.

40:26.959 --> 40:29.495
Just another day in the
life of Henry Higgins.

40:29.530 --> 40:30.568
Yes, sir.

40:33.758 --> 40:35.082
Sorry, sir.

40:40.261 --> 40:42.293
I think this could prove
an even better location.

40:42.319 --> 40:44.936
Well, I can't think of a better
place to get one's auto fixed.

40:45.272 --> 40:46.844
Although I still think

40:46.888 --> 40:50.097
Crabtree and Bloom would have rolled
off the tongue a little easier.

40:50.217 --> 40:51.760
Thank you for all your help, George.

40:51.793 --> 40:54.759
- I'm sure you'll do a roaring business.
- So do I.

40:55.389 --> 40:56.729
You there.

40:56.989 --> 40:59.108
Would you like to come
take a look inside?

41:01.807 --> 41:04.269
You realize what you've
done, don't you, George?

41:04.270 --> 41:05.360
What's that?

41:05.410 --> 41:07.861
You've inserted yourself
directly into our family.

41:07.981 --> 41:09.471
Yes, I suppose I have.

41:09.527 --> 41:11.668
I wonder how that will work out for you.

41:12.028 --> 41:13.366
What do you mean by that?

41:13.416 --> 41:16.188
Well, he hasn't really
been successful at much.

41:17.001 --> 41:19.230
I do hope you have deep pockets.

41:29.821 --> 41:32.178
William. How much longer?

41:32.222 --> 41:33.666
Just a moment.

41:37.412 --> 41:39.244
You can open them now.

41:41.059 --> 41:42.924
Oh, it's beautiful, William.

41:44.633 --> 41:46.063
Yes it is.

41:46.183 --> 41:47.527
And...

41:47.583 --> 41:49.126
where are you?

41:51.019 --> 41:55.045
I'd say I'm looking
east over the Don River.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.375
No.

41:56.845 --> 41:59.832
You are in the master bedroom.

42:00.131 --> 42:01.874
I'm in the dining room.

42:02.067 --> 42:04.192
To my left is the sitting room.

42:05.470 --> 42:07.014
What do you think?

42:08.077 --> 42:10.815
In the middle of nature
in the middle of the city.

42:10.876 --> 42:13.682
It's wonderful, William!

42:15.359 --> 42:17.007
But...

42:18.678 --> 42:21.030
- But what?
- Well,

42:21.150 --> 42:23.448
don't you think it would
be better on the other side?

42:23.568 --> 42:25.518
I mean, I'd much
prefer to watch a sunset

42:25.529 --> 42:27.294
than a sunrise.

42:27.599 --> 42:30.294
Well, I...

42:32.706 --> 42:34.482
I'm not quite sure...

42:34.670 --> 42:36.374
William,

42:36.778 --> 42:38.521
I'm only teasing.

42:39.351 --> 42:41.824
- It's perfect.
- Oh, good.

42:41.852 --> 42:43.900
I'll place the offer in the morning.

42:44.757 --> 42:47.861
Now, what you didn't
see on the way in...

42:49.466 --> 42:51.109
William,

42:52.302 --> 42:54.496
I know now that I did what I had to do.

42:55.630 --> 42:57.263
Yes, you did.

42:58.209 --> 43:00.317
And Eva Pearce?

43:02.010 --> 43:03.537
She's gone, William.

43:03.825 --> 43:05.446
Gone for good.

43:05.916 --> 43:07.394
Good.

43:07.599 --> 43:09.021
Good.

43:10.244 --> 43:12.932
Now since this will be
a thoroughly modern home,

43:12.966 --> 43:15.965
I have an idea of how
we could recruit energy

43:15.976 --> 43:18.326
from the planet itself.
