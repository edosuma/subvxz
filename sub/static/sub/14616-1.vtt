WEBVTT

01:52.378 --> 01:55.214
Are these our people?
Sourcing targets now, sir.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.381
It's 70/30.

01:56.383 --> 01:58.050
Are units on site?

01:58.052 --> 01:59.718
Roger that.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.421
This is a priority
level 4 target.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.389
Working on positive
identification.

02:34.921 --> 02:37.489
Put the team on Amber.
Yes, sir. They are
standing by.

03:01.881 --> 03:02.748
Get out!

03:10.123 --> 03:11.690
This is Zeus, over.

03:13.426 --> 03:15.093
Hostages are
out of the boats.

03:15.095 --> 03:16.395
Safety's off.

03:25.573 --> 03:29.575
Watch your target indicators.
We are not cleared hot,
hold glass.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.910
I say again, we are
not cleared hot.

03:31.912 --> 03:35.514
Roger, Zeus. This is rampage,
holding scope.

03:35.516 --> 03:38.550
Hey, air force. How's my
designated marksman
from falcon team doing?

03:38.552 --> 03:41.119
Uh, don't you mean
"chair force," sir?

03:41.121 --> 03:44.523
Due respect,
we've been on the reticle
shooting 2,000 rounds a week

03:44.525 --> 03:48.093
for the last four months
pre this deployment.

03:48.095 --> 03:51.430
We're here to work,
just like you <i> pendejos.</i>

03:51.432 --> 03:54.066
So, why don't you go
fuck yourself, cervantes?

03:54.068 --> 03:55.667
Uh, no, thank you,
chair force.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.769
Falcon in position, Zeus.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.839
Beats the shit
out of over-watch.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.274
<i> Air force thanks you</i>
<i> for the ride along.</i>

04:03.476 --> 04:06.979
My pleasure.
Suicide, sitrep.

04:06.981 --> 04:09.281
Suicide in position,
I'm on glass.

04:10.918 --> 04:14.886
Behold a pale horse.
That's a bad fucking omen.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.154
This looks like
a real shit show.

04:17.156 --> 04:18.991
Hold for Pegasus, over.

05:04.737 --> 05:06.071
The executioner.

05:08.074 --> 05:10.008
Bandolier's on glass.

05:13.379 --> 05:14.813
String bean.

05:19.252 --> 05:24.389
The deaths of these American
citizens are a direct result
of America's crimes.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.458
Blood for blood.

05:27.193 --> 05:29.594
Hostages are
American, sir.

05:29.596 --> 05:31.863
Go to guns,
they're cleared hot.

05:33.933 --> 05:37.869
Zeus, this is command.
You are cleared hot.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.405
This is Zeus, over.
We are cleared hot.

05:40.407 --> 05:42.107
I say again,
we are cleared hot.

05:46.646 --> 05:49.348
Rampage, on your shot,
we go.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.717
<i> Initiate contact</i>
<i> at your discretion.</i>

06:02.662 --> 06:04.396
Juvenile in target group.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.269
No fucking way.

06:11.271 --> 06:12.704
Kid's gonna do
the first one.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.775
Rampage,
merc the motherfucker.

06:22.582 --> 06:24.416
Rampage,
take the shot now!

06:30.556 --> 06:31.890
Take the shot, man.

06:41.033 --> 06:43.268
No joy. Repeat,
falcon's on glass,
standing by.

06:43.270 --> 06:44.803
Requesting precedence.

06:50.777 --> 06:53.278
Rampage,
take the fucking shot!

06:54.381 --> 06:56.348
Pick up the knife.

06:56.350 --> 06:57.849
I said pick up the knife!

06:57.851 --> 06:59.484
<i> Do you read,</i>
<i> rampage?</i>

07:01.120 --> 07:02.020
Take the shot.

07:04.357 --> 07:05.557
<i> Suicide,</i>
<i> it's all yours.</i>

07:16.336 --> 07:17.936
One hostage down, sir.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.871
Where's Pegasus?
Two minutes out.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.414
Send it.

07:35.154 --> 07:36.521
Let's back 'em up.

07:36.523 --> 07:40.025
Sourcing multiple targets.
Holding on relay.

08:52.265 --> 08:52.964
Take the shot.

09:10.983 --> 09:12.284
Range me.
One thousand meters.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.257
Miss.

09:47.219 --> 09:49.354
Engaging target.
Arming missiles.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.060
Target engaged.

09:56.662 --> 09:59.064
Drop the hammer.
Copy that.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.734
Missile away.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.028
Target destroyed.

10:32.665 --> 10:33.832
Bring 'em home.

10:58.157 --> 11:01.459
Pediatrician from
Colorado Springs.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.995
Provided care to villages
that hadn't seen a doctor
in a decade.

11:05.197 --> 11:07.799
Bird's here. Move out.

11:08.601 --> 11:11.269
Gunny, have a word?

11:17.643 --> 11:18.443
You hesitated.

11:19.545 --> 11:21.012
You choked.

11:23.115 --> 11:23.982
You wanna talk about it?

11:26.652 --> 11:27.886
I'll get 'em next time.

11:29.221 --> 11:30.722
We're not in the business
of "next time."

11:31.791 --> 11:33.291
We're in the business
of one time.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.727
You get one bite
at that apple.

11:36.595 --> 11:37.729
You got it?

11:39.598 --> 11:40.899
Yeah.

12:24.677 --> 12:25.910
Ooh.

12:25.912 --> 12:26.945
Come on!

12:30.282 --> 12:31.182
- Man.
- Whoo!

12:35.387 --> 12:37.255
- Yeah, yeah!
- All right.

12:42.061 --> 12:43.328
Whoo!

12:43.330 --> 12:44.629
To Istanbul.

12:44.631 --> 12:45.830
Out of
the motherfucking shit!

12:46.599 --> 12:47.899
I thought Iraq
was a shithole.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.668
Syria. Afghanistan.

12:50.670 --> 12:54.305
It's all the same hell pit of
crazed assholes whose idea of
a good time is decapitation.

12:54.307 --> 12:57.242
Hey, hey, hey.
Can we not?

12:57.244 --> 13:00.845
Hey, rojas, you wanna tell
your dipshit boyfriend
to chill out?

13:00.847 --> 13:03.481
Ex-boyfriend.
That obsession story
is over.

13:05.718 --> 13:09.120
Hey, don't take it
out on me, junior,
just 'cause you froze up.

13:18.264 --> 13:20.198
You killed the vibe, man.
You got to do that?

13:20.200 --> 13:21.833
What?

13:21.835 --> 13:23.735
Go fuck yourself,
chair force.

13:23.737 --> 13:26.171
We don't get into enough shit,
we got to fight amongst
ourselves?

13:26.173 --> 13:27.071
Fighting makes me wet.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.418
Don't let her
get to you, brother.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.055
Ah.

13:44.057 --> 13:47.425
She calls me "junior" again,
rojas is gonna be
short a spotter.

13:48.727 --> 13:51.396
Aungst is harmless,
man. Ignore her.

13:55.301 --> 13:57.135
What's been eating
at you anyway, brother?

14:00.272 --> 14:02.307
She's right, though.
Aungst.

14:04.109 --> 14:06.878
I froze up, putting that
goddamn kid in my crosshairs.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.012
Yeah.

14:08.681 --> 14:09.881
And?

14:11.951 --> 14:14.919
And if I'm gonna keep
doing this, I don't
wanna do it half-assed.

14:16.455 --> 14:18.189
Embrace the suck, man.

14:18.891 --> 14:20.325
Be a marine.

14:23.162 --> 14:25.496
I'm good.

14:25.498 --> 14:28.099
You sure? I'm around
if you need me, brother.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.535
Yeah, man,
just give me a minute.

14:32.571 --> 14:33.471
No problem.

16:22.881 --> 16:25.049
You followed me
a long way.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.451
You better have
brought your game.

16:28.020 --> 16:29.454
No pressure.

16:40.232 --> 16:42.066
So, what brings you
to Istanbul?

16:43.903 --> 16:46.337
Really?
That's your lead, huh?

16:49.274 --> 16:51.943
I'm sorry. It's just...

16:51.945 --> 16:54.312
It's been a long time
since I've seen such
a beautiful woman.

16:56.715 --> 16:57.515
Better.

17:01.487 --> 17:03.588
Business. You?

17:04.089 --> 17:06.424
Same. Where's home?

17:07.092 --> 17:08.693
Long way from here.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.969
What about you?

17:17.971 --> 17:22.440
I'm not really sure.
Here right now.
Next week, I don't know.

17:30.516 --> 17:31.549
Military?

17:32.484 --> 17:34.152
That obvious?

17:34.154 --> 17:36.654
You're not army,
you're definitely not
Navy or air force.

17:37.623 --> 17:39.290
There's one left.

17:39.292 --> 17:40.224
Coast guard?

17:53.472 --> 17:56.774
Yeah, I'll be a puddle pirate
if it gets me an invite
back to your hotel.

18:32.845 --> 18:33.878
Excuse me.

18:39.151 --> 18:40.384
Hey, gunny.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.521
Bidwell?

18:43.523 --> 18:46.357
Food boats, south side
of the bridge.

18:46.359 --> 18:47.592
Twenty minutes.

19:14.486 --> 19:15.586
Crazy world, huh?

19:17.456 --> 19:19.390
What're you doing here?

19:22.828 --> 19:25.163
You were followed out of Syria
with a bounty on your head.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.832
150,000 Euros to put you
in a body bag.

19:29.034 --> 19:31.802
The call landed on my desk,
and I came to clear it up.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.004
And?

19:33.006 --> 19:34.372
It's all done for now,
but there'll be more.

19:36.608 --> 19:37.508
Syria.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.379
A mad fucking country, eh?

19:42.881 --> 19:43.781
It's all the same.

19:47.319 --> 19:48.553
You gotta ask, right?

19:49.821 --> 19:51.589
Miller briefed me.

19:51.591 --> 19:55.560
I blew it, man.
I messed up the entire op.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.329
Miller would've busted me
down a pay grade if it
wasn't for my old man.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.463
What do you hear from him?

20:00.465 --> 20:01.966
He's in the wind as usual.

20:04.169 --> 20:06.537
You're a valuable asset,
gunny, if you need more time.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.239
I'm all right.

20:09.441 --> 20:10.875
You can't repeat Syria.

20:12.110 --> 20:14.879
He was just a boy.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.982
Tune in to what I'm about
to tell to you, gunny.

20:17.984 --> 20:21.285
The work we do,
it isn't god's work.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.322
We do the stuff
he doesn't want to do.

20:24.324 --> 20:28.359
There are no chapter and verse
to help us sleep
better at night.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.728
Are we morally defensible?
No, probably not.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.464
Are we necessary?
Abso-fucking-lutely!

20:36.768 --> 20:38.603
This is the job.

20:38.605 --> 20:41.539
We chew through
the hard stuff.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.975
There is no Providence
for what we do, is there?

20:45.777 --> 20:46.978
I hesitated.

20:50.048 --> 20:52.750
You gotta turn off
the feeling side of your head.

20:55.020 --> 20:57.922
You've got a conscience.
That's no bad thing.

20:57.924 --> 21:01.726
But don't let imperfection
be the enemy of the good.

21:04.663 --> 21:08.332
It's hard living life after
watching through a reticle.

21:09.768 --> 21:13.904
Trigger to target,
life and death,
black and white.

21:16.508 --> 21:18.342
Go find the blues
and the Greens, gunny.

21:22.748 --> 21:23.748
Back to work.

22:36.421 --> 22:38.356
Major bidwell, how'd it go?

22:38.857 --> 22:40.124
Piece of piss.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.792
The rest of you look drunk.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.928
We were working on it, sir,
when you called.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.262
Where's Miller, sir?

22:45.264 --> 22:47.498
You're not the only
team in the field.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.101
I assume you haven't read
your briefing reports.

22:50.103 --> 22:53.337
Only because we can count
on you to tell us what
the hell we're doing here.

22:53.339 --> 22:56.107
Well, the corps has
offered your services
for site protection.

22:56.109 --> 22:58.309
Trans-Georgian pipeline.

22:58.311 --> 23:01.145
Transporting natural gas
from Georgia

23:01.147 --> 23:04.715
through the black sea into
eastern Europe and beyond.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.318
That's a lot of territory
to secure.

23:07.320 --> 23:10.421
Due respect, colonel,
we're not civilian
contractors.

23:10.423 --> 23:13.124
Whoa. Hold on there,
air force.

23:13.126 --> 23:15.659
You're on a ride along
with the marines
as a courtesy.

23:15.661 --> 23:18.863
Understand?
Understood.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.664
Colonel, sorry to
keep you waiting.

23:20.666 --> 23:22.500
No, you kept me waiting.

23:25.837 --> 23:26.971
Then let's get to it.

23:37.115 --> 23:39.016
I'm Robin slater,

23:39.018 --> 23:41.919
civilian-military fusion
center, operations desk.

23:41.921 --> 23:45.489
Colonel Sergej babayev
will be our liaison
with Georgian army.

23:45.491 --> 23:49.693
The cfc has been asked
to organize security for
the trans-Georgian pipeline,

23:49.695 --> 23:53.731
most of which is being
monitored by local military
and law enforcement.

23:53.733 --> 23:56.400
Recent incidents in
construction areas,
however,

23:56.402 --> 23:58.936
require a higher-level
response.

23:58.938 --> 24:02.940
In Georgia,
just outside of tbilisi,
involving local insurgents,

24:02.942 --> 24:06.644
as well as radical elements
from Afghanistan and Iraq.

24:06.646 --> 24:10.514
That is why the cfc
approved the request
to bring in your team.

24:10.516 --> 24:12.516
What sort of incidents
are we talking about?

24:12.518 --> 24:16.253
Sniper attacks on managerial
and engineer personnel.

24:16.255 --> 24:19.723
Bombings of key
pipeline infrastructure
in strategic locations.

24:19.725 --> 24:21.725
Yeah. Near here.

24:21.727 --> 24:24.962
Tbilisi, Georgia,
just south of chechnya,

24:24.964 --> 24:27.431
just north of the Armenian
and turkish borders.

24:27.433 --> 24:29.200
This is a rough
neighborhood.

24:29.202 --> 24:31.635
Intelligence on the ground
attribute the attacks

24:31.637 --> 24:36.874
to an Afghan militant,
roshan gazakov,
aka abu abdollah,

24:37.809 --> 24:39.610
trained by British sas.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.745
And another jihadi
is born.

24:41.747 --> 24:45.249
Austrian energy tycoon
Killian grun is scheduled
to do a walkthrough

24:45.251 --> 24:49.253
of a gazsnab pumping station
just outside of tbilisi
day after tomorrow.

24:49.255 --> 24:52.223
He will meet with
tribal elders to
settle land disputes.

24:52.225 --> 24:54.258
Your mission, over-watch.

24:54.260 --> 24:57.962
Take out enemy snipers
with assistance from
our eyes in the sky.

24:58.697 --> 25:00.798
Gazakov plays a long game.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.933
He kept his rage
hidden deep inside

25:02.935 --> 25:06.070
while being schooled
by the very people
he intended to kill.

25:06.072 --> 25:07.738
This guy is no joke.

25:07.740 --> 25:09.139
We'll be providing
uav support.

25:09.941 --> 25:12.042
Drones?
Yes.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.777
The mq-1 predator
will be our eyes in the sky.

25:14.279 --> 25:15.846
God's hammer.

25:15.848 --> 25:19.049
I'll be quarterbacking
this thing from my jsoc
office here in Turkey.

25:20.485 --> 25:23.587
This is my stop.
I'll be watching you.

25:34.933 --> 25:37.034
Cervantes!
Sir?

25:37.036 --> 25:38.903
Get a haircut.
Yes, sir.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.307
Watch your back.

25:46.077 --> 25:47.845
And I'll see you
on the next one.

25:54.986 --> 25:56.587
Blues and Greens, gunny.

26:04.596 --> 26:09.400
Hey. No hard feelings?

26:09.402 --> 26:13.504
Would've been nice if you
were a little more specific
about your business here.

26:13.506 --> 26:14.838
The same could be
said for you.

26:15.540 --> 26:17.374
Put a pin in it?

26:17.376 --> 26:19.043
I'll see you
in Georgia.

27:10.795 --> 27:11.829
Three teams.

27:13.164 --> 27:15.599
Think they can protect
all this high ground?

27:15.601 --> 27:18.202
Don't worry about my teams.

27:18.204 --> 27:21.472
How's your eyes
in the sky doing?
Full operational go.

27:21.474 --> 27:24.808
Smart enough to
tell friend from foe?

27:24.810 --> 27:26.844
Smart enough to tell
which rock you guys
took a piss against.

27:32.584 --> 27:34.184
Okay,
people, listen up.

27:34.186 --> 27:36.053
I want three predators
in the air,

27:36.055 --> 27:39.790
eyes on Killian grun
the entire time he's on site.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.158
Let's make it happen.

27:41.160 --> 27:44.128
Copy that. Grun on site
in 90 minutes.

27:47.298 --> 27:49.400
Okay. Listen up!

27:51.269 --> 27:55.272
Here's the short list
on the package.

27:55.274 --> 27:59.343
Killian grun,
an Austrian oil tycoon.

27:59.345 --> 27:59.343
<i> He is the guy</i>
<i> who will make sure</i>

27:59.345 --> 28:04.348
<i> western Europe doesn't need</i>
<i> Russian gas from the Ukraine.</i>

28:04.350 --> 28:08.218
This is the guy to kill to
make the biggest statement.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.887
Oh.

28:09.889 --> 28:13.257
He travels with
Blackwater contractors

28:13.259 --> 28:16.827
<i> in a heavily armed and</i>
<i> heavily armored motorcade.</i>

28:18.897 --> 28:21.231
At 1900 tonight,

28:21.233 --> 28:24.268
he will meet with
the tribal elders to
secure the land rights.

28:25.070 --> 28:27.538
We have him for two hours.

28:27.540 --> 28:30.974
Okay, we got it.
He's a rich guy,
don't let him die.

28:30.976 --> 28:32.376
Let's eat dirt.

28:49.461 --> 28:52.730
<i> Eyes on that</i>
<i> tree line, people. I can</i>
<i> smell them from here.</i>

29:00.438 --> 29:03.140
Rampage, blue sector.
All clear here,
no signs of movement.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.280
Falcon, white sector.

29:15.086 --> 29:16.787
Suicide, green sector.

29:25.363 --> 29:26.764
Motorcade, one click out.

29:43.081 --> 29:45.215
This is suicide.
The package inbound
from my six.

30:00.932 --> 30:03.467
I've got nothing on glass.
No joy.

30:03.469 --> 30:04.468
Stay with it.

30:12.777 --> 30:15.212
No target indicators
on glass. All clear.

30:19.350 --> 30:21.552
I think I'm seeing
something.

30:21.554 --> 30:24.888
See what?
What's going on out there?
Somebody talk to me.

31:04.896 --> 31:06.163
Rojas is hit.

31:06.165 --> 31:08.031
<i> I say again,</i>
<i> rojas is hit.</i>

31:08.033 --> 31:11.101
Contact, unknown position.
Falcon, talk to me.

31:11.103 --> 31:14.538
What the fuck's
going on down there?
Falcon, give me something.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.473
Incoming fire
from my two o'clock.

31:20.445 --> 31:21.278
Argh!

31:24.616 --> 31:26.650
Find me a fucking target.

31:26.652 --> 31:29.753
I got nothing on glass, man.
No fucking joy.
Where the fuck are they?

31:29.755 --> 31:31.421
Where are my drones?

31:34.626 --> 31:37.794
Ladies and gentlemen,
we got marines
in a fire fight.

31:37.796 --> 31:39.730
Let's help them out.

31:39.732 --> 31:41.565
Find me a target.
Copy that.

31:51.609 --> 31:54.311
Unregistered heat signature.
Possible hostile position.

31:54.313 --> 31:56.914
Could be a satellite echo.
Confirming.

31:56.916 --> 31:58.548
Adjust right, 20 degrees.

32:05.957 --> 32:07.357
Man down.
I got a man down.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.496
Let's take a closer look,
sir. Zooming in 500%.

32:18.603 --> 32:20.337
How about that?
Arming missiles.

32:21.639 --> 32:22.506
Target acquired.

32:23.107 --> 32:24.141
Make it rain.

32:32.884 --> 32:33.951
Argh!

32:43.861 --> 32:45.228
Target destroyed.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.165
Good on you.

33:24.102 --> 33:25.635
Rampage,
what's your status?

33:32.110 --> 33:34.644
Oh, god.
Aurelia. Hey.

33:39.450 --> 33:42.185
Rampage,
what's your status?

34:26.731 --> 34:28.831
Without confirmation
of a kill, we assume
gazakov's still alive.

34:32.270 --> 34:34.737
Spent brass. It's a...

34:34.739 --> 34:37.340
14.5 millimeter
anti-tank round.

34:40.043 --> 34:41.311
There's a souvenir.

34:59.897 --> 35:02.032
Impossible shot.

35:02.034 --> 35:04.067
How the fuck
did they find us?

35:04.069 --> 35:05.569
Rojas' hide fired on?

35:07.538 --> 35:09.106
- Maines?
- No one's that good.

35:11.776 --> 35:14.344
And not a single
Georgian hit, colonel.

35:14.346 --> 35:15.679
You watch yourself, marine.

35:17.281 --> 35:20.016
Rojas could build a hide
better than anyone
in the business.

35:20.018 --> 35:22.519
It was an impossible shot.

35:22.521 --> 35:24.588
What exactly are you
trying to imply?

35:24.590 --> 35:27.424
I'm not trying.
I'm saying it.

35:27.426 --> 35:30.093
You or someone on your team
is feeding our coordinates
to gazakov.

35:30.095 --> 35:31.194
Stand down.

35:33.231 --> 35:36.566
Unit discipline leaves
something to be desired,
major.

35:36.568 --> 35:38.902
It is my job, colonel.

35:38.904 --> 35:40.237
Maybe you're forgetting
about the two body bags

35:40.239 --> 35:42.372
loaded with a marine
and a us airman.

35:42.374 --> 35:44.841
I am forgetting?
Do you forget
who you're talking to?

35:44.843 --> 35:47.110
Americans? Matters only
when you get killed!

35:47.112 --> 35:48.145
Fucker! You killed her!

35:50.548 --> 35:53.316
Stand down!

35:53.318 --> 35:57.320
I am sick of
all of your shit-talking
and ass-grabbing.

35:57.322 --> 35:59.589
Honor, courage,
commitment.

36:00.725 --> 36:03.360
You are marines.
Act like it.

36:37.828 --> 36:39.863
Welcome to pamir-alay.

36:39.865 --> 36:43.466
You must have fucked up
something bad to get
sent here, bro.

36:43.468 --> 36:47.304
Sector of trans-Georgian
pipeline, official
designated pacified zone.

36:48.406 --> 36:50.574
Thanks, I think.

36:50.576 --> 36:53.376
You have better coat
than that piece of shit?

36:53.378 --> 36:55.378
Twelve thousand feet.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.881
Dude, you're going to
need a better coat.

36:57.883 --> 36:59.849
So, when did this all
stop being Russia, anyway?

36:59.851 --> 37:03.353
Year I was born, 1991.

37:03.355 --> 37:04.588
What's your
job here exactly?

37:04.590 --> 37:06.823
Me? I am
Jack-of-all-trades.

37:06.825 --> 37:10.527
But for you,
I'm your new spotter.
We'll see about that.

37:58.943 --> 38:02.379
Don't speak
a word of English.
Very old-school.

38:02.381 --> 38:05.115
Know these mountains
better than anyone.
Pipeline pays 'em...

38:06.318 --> 38:08.652
That son of a whore
better stay away from me.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.587
He welcomes you
warmly to his country, bro.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.450
Mmm-mmm.

38:42.887 --> 38:44.788
This is our
American savior?

38:52.797 --> 38:54.998
Gunnery sergeant
Brandon Beckett, sir.

39:03.207 --> 39:06.409
We keep this up,
you're gonna
run out of men soon.

39:06.411 --> 39:07.544
Then it's just
me and you.

39:13.484 --> 39:15.552
Ready for some action?

39:17.355 --> 39:18.521
Yeah.

39:20.057 --> 39:21.024
Good.

39:49.086 --> 39:52.021
This guy attacked
a Georgian colonel.

39:53.257 --> 39:54.724
Insubordination.

39:56.227 --> 39:59.129
This is what
your report says.

40:01.999 --> 40:02.932
Why?

40:04.668 --> 40:06.736
I think he, or someone
below him, is a traitor,

40:08.539 --> 40:10.640
secretly dealing intel
to the insurgents.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.877
You think.

40:13.879 --> 40:17.013
Enemy sniper team
dialed into our
exact positions.

40:17.015 --> 40:19.649
We were sitting ducks.

40:19.651 --> 40:24.053
Lost some good friends.
And not one Georgian
casualty.

40:24.055 --> 40:26.990
What you pursue is
much bigger than one man.

40:28.125 --> 40:30.727
Much more is at stake.

40:30.729 --> 40:36.533
I would suggest gathering
more evidence before
leveling such accusations.

40:36.535 --> 40:39.169
It's kind of hard to do
from over 1,000 miles away.

40:39.171 --> 40:41.171
Yes.

40:41.173 --> 40:44.707
The old Soviet way
of solving problem
with loudmouth.

40:48.245 --> 40:51.648
This insurgent sniper
could provide truth.

40:53.751 --> 40:54.918
Right.

40:54.920 --> 40:57.020
I'm serious.

40:57.022 --> 40:58.988
How do you say,
"from horse's mouth"?

40:59.757 --> 41:02.759
So, I just ask gazakov?

41:03.861 --> 41:05.962
Something of value

41:07.565 --> 41:09.532
offered in trade
for the truth.

41:20.077 --> 41:24.080
Too fast for you,
American?
I'm fine.

41:24.082 --> 41:28.384
Maybe next time,
you'll think twice about
attacking senior officer.

41:28.386 --> 41:30.587
Mountaintop is good

41:30.589 --> 41:31.788
for "cooling off," yeah?

41:32.957 --> 41:34.324
So, where are
we going, anyway?

41:34.326 --> 41:35.692
Listening post.

41:35.694 --> 41:38.127
Very sensitive information
passes through,

41:38.129 --> 41:42.031
like enemy troop
size and movement,
coordinates, surveillance.

41:42.033 --> 41:45.235
If we don't regularly patrol,
the chechen thieves will
dismantle it to ground.

42:09.126 --> 42:11.461
Idiots!

42:11.463 --> 42:16.900
Don't they know everything
is encrypted, firewalled,
unhackable?

42:16.902 --> 42:18.835
What are you gonna do?
Shoot them.

42:20.905 --> 42:23.706
"Shoot them"?
Yes, American. Shoot them.

42:24.508 --> 42:27.010
But they're only thieves.

42:27.012 --> 42:29.279
Chechen thieves not
exactly the same thing.

42:30.948 --> 42:32.282
You propose
we do what?

42:33.050 --> 42:34.017
Arrest them.

42:37.255 --> 42:41.991
Arrest them,
like John mcclane,
yes, in <i> die hard?</i>

42:42.693 --> 42:45.194
Something like that.

42:45.196 --> 42:48.965
Well, show us how it is
more correctly done.
Democratically.

42:54.438 --> 42:56.172
Give me your short arm.

42:59.743 --> 43:02.912
You as well. Go on.

43:07.785 --> 43:10.320
Yippee ki-yay,
motherfucker!

43:36.313 --> 43:38.047
Stop! Right there!

43:55.199 --> 43:57.333
Help me. Please.

44:01.472 --> 44:02.405
Don't do it!

45:00.664 --> 45:02.298
Welcome to
the wild, wild east.

45:21.385 --> 45:26.022
Your father, Thomas Beckett,
is no stranger to me.

45:27.591 --> 45:30.927
Different times,
different war.

45:33.598 --> 45:35.465
We were adversaries
back then,

45:38.035 --> 45:40.870
facing each other
across a battle line.

45:47.244 --> 45:48.478
South America.

45:50.080 --> 45:53.282
Somehow, we avoided
killing one another.

45:56.954 --> 46:01.290
For my heroic efforts
in the jungles of Nicaragua,

46:01.292 --> 46:06.095
I was rewarded with
three tours in the
first chechen war.

46:06.097 --> 46:07.830
Want a test of your courage?

46:08.565 --> 46:10.299
Pick a fight with chechen.

46:12.669 --> 46:14.036
Before chechnya,

46:15.239 --> 46:16.439
I was...

46:18.709 --> 46:20.309
A soldier like
any other soldier.

46:21.845 --> 46:26.149
All of that changed
on December 25, 1995.

46:27.551 --> 46:30.019
Christmas day
in your calendar.
Yeah.

46:39.830 --> 46:46.102
Our unit was assigned
to support the troops
holding ingushetiya border.

46:46.104 --> 46:49.939
<i> Many conscripts deserted</i>
<i> their units and some of them</i>
<i> joined the rebels.</i>

46:49.941 --> 46:52.842
<i> It was impossible to tell</i>
<i> friend from foe.</i>

46:52.844 --> 46:56.412
<i> Squad was stopped</i>
<i> on a city block</i>
<i> that seemed safe.</i>

46:57.147 --> 46:58.481
<i> My position was set up.</i>

47:01.385 --> 47:04.720
<i> It was my spotter, Yuri,</i>
<i> who saw him first, of course.</i>

47:04.722 --> 47:05.888
<i> "Andrei," he said,</i>

47:08.625 --> 47:11.894
<i> "the boy is carrying</i>
<i> something under his coat."</i>

47:13.831 --> 47:16.032
<i> I looked at boy</i>
<i> through my scope.</i>

47:18.202 --> 47:19.869
<i> No more than 10 years old.</i>

47:21.572 --> 47:25.241
<i> Was it a loaf of bread he was</i>
<i> carrying under his coat?</i>

47:25.976 --> 47:27.043
<i> No.</i>

47:27.711 --> 47:28.945
<i> It was a bomb,</i>

47:30.681 --> 47:33.049
<i> fabricated from mortar shell.</i>

47:36.687 --> 47:38.554
<i> My humanity tells me,</i>

47:40.090 --> 47:42.491
<i> "a little boy</i>
<i> found a bomb</i>

47:44.361 --> 47:47.830
<i> "and only wants to</i>
<i> turn it over</i>
<i> to the soldiers."</i>

48:01.912 --> 48:04.380
Every sniper hesitated.

48:07.618 --> 48:08.918
But only once.

48:13.624 --> 48:16.092
Caucasus mountains in
the winter.

48:16.094 --> 48:17.827
Imagine the vacation
possibilities.

48:17.829 --> 48:20.196
Well, if it's any consolation,
it's 100 over here.

48:20.198 --> 48:21.797
That's in the shade.

48:21.799 --> 48:23.866
Well, consider me
unconsoled.

48:23.868 --> 48:27.403
By the way, the guy we
took out on the Ridge,
turned out it wasn't gazakov.

48:27.405 --> 48:28.838
<i> Sources say it was</i>
<i> gazakov's brother-in-law.</i>

48:28.840 --> 48:28.838
You sure?

48:28.840 --> 48:34.043
<i> Yeah, they got his remains.</i>
<i> By the way, we're rolling out</i>
<i> tonight, gunny.</i>

48:34.045 --> 48:36.512
<i> Gotta follow the pipeline</i>
<i> down to the seaside.</i>

48:36.514 --> 48:38.114
Do a little recon
on the next stop,

48:38.116 --> 48:40.549
make sure what happened here
does not get repeated.

48:40.551 --> 48:42.184
Anything on babayev?

48:42.186 --> 48:44.787
No, we drilled down
to bedrock. He's clean.

48:44.789 --> 48:46.589
<i> Just do your</i>
<i> probation, gunny.</i>

48:46.591 --> 48:47.990
<i> Keep your head down,</i>
<i> see you when you're back.</i>

49:30.467 --> 49:31.434
Not bad.

49:32.202 --> 49:34.403
That will be the day,

49:34.405 --> 49:36.505
when American can beat
Russian at winter sport.

49:36.940 --> 49:39.241
1980, hockey.

49:39.977 --> 49:41.210
Fluke.

49:41.945 --> 49:44.847
2014, sochi.

49:44.849 --> 49:48.351
Women's half-pipe.
Usa takes the gold
and the bronze.

49:48.353 --> 49:50.753
Half-pipe?
Be serious.

49:56.893 --> 50:00.129
So, how does a Russian
officer with the 3rd guards
spetsnaz brigade

50:00.131 --> 50:04.900
end up working site security
for a euro-Asian
energy consortium?

50:04.902 --> 50:08.004
Do you have any idea
what these people
pay private contractor?

50:09.139 --> 50:11.807
Like your Navy seals
who work for Blackwater,

50:11.809 --> 50:15.011
Russian special forces, too,
must feather nests.

50:15.013 --> 50:17.446
Start over.
Lead more normal life.

50:18.749 --> 50:21.283
Well, this is normal?

50:21.285 --> 50:24.653
Compared to where
I've been to? Yes,
American, this is normal.

50:30.093 --> 50:32.461
No family, no kids.

50:36.333 --> 50:39.235
Few choose this fate,

50:39.237 --> 50:43.606
but after the first kill,
maybe second,
sniper is what we are.

50:44.775 --> 50:46.042
Must commit.

50:46.810 --> 50:48.611
No hesitation.

50:50.180 --> 50:52.448
All humanity lost.

50:58.321 --> 50:59.622
Beautiful, isn't it?

51:47.304 --> 51:50.806
<i> Colonel, I put glass</i>
<i> on the path. There's movement.</i>
<i> They're coming, colonel.</i>

51:52.275 --> 51:55.444
An hour, maybe less.

51:55.446 --> 51:58.180
<i> Chechens, colonel.</i>
<i> Lots of chechens.</i>

52:00.151 --> 52:01.250
I will enjoy watching
what my brother...

52:01.252 --> 52:04.153
Will do to you...

52:04.155 --> 52:05.754
And how...
...He will kill you.

52:20.403 --> 52:22.605
I will kill you first.

52:23.740 --> 52:24.640
Cheer up!

52:35.085 --> 52:39.321
Saajid! There is one more,
there, behind the stone.

52:51.067 --> 52:53.602
I swear, I think
you're enjoying this.

52:53.604 --> 52:55.271
Just another day you die.

52:55.972 --> 52:57.339
Find a hide.

53:01.611 --> 53:03.179
Shoot to kill!

53:06.149 --> 53:07.650
Take the eastern slope.

53:49.426 --> 53:53.262
Where the fuck are they?
They should have been here
long time ago.

53:53.264 --> 53:56.065
That's what they
want you to think.

53:56.067 --> 53:59.335
They're just doing what
they're trained to do.
They want to put us on edge.

53:59.337 --> 54:00.736
It's working.

54:01.771 --> 54:04.373
Relax. They'll be here.

54:23.893 --> 54:24.994
Find me that sniper,
saajid.

54:28.398 --> 54:31.367
At my 11 o'clock,
something moved in the snow.
Do you see it?

54:31.369 --> 54:32.768
I don't see shit, bro.

54:39.909 --> 54:43.545
Kill one man,
terrorize 1,000.
Get ready for a gunfight.

56:25.949 --> 56:26.815
Ah!

56:39.863 --> 56:42.097
Well, say hello to
my Russian friend!

57:08.925 --> 57:09.925
Rpg!

57:11.327 --> 57:12.194
Argh!

59:05.976 --> 59:08.777
No, no, no...
I'm here to help you.

59:08.779 --> 59:10.212
I'm putting my gun away.

01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:43.839
Mmm.

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:13.368
When did saajid
choose them over us?

01:01:15.538 --> 01:01:19.941
Last month? Yesterday?
Ten minutes ago?
No difference.

01:01:19.943 --> 01:01:21.376
He's dead because he did.

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.551
What?

01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:33.288
Did you hesitate before
shooting this gutless traitor?

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:50.439
What're they doing here?
Eyes in the sky.

01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:52.874
We're done.

01:01:55.478 --> 01:01:56.778
Lesson learned.

01:01:57.914 --> 01:02:01.316
Helo him out of there.
Put him back in the dirt.

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:03.785
Roger that, colonel.

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:22.904
<i> Your contact is</i>
<i> at our forward op base.</i>

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:27.209
<i> He will take you to meet</i>
<i> gazakov himself.</i>

01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:31.246
<i> You have a one-in-100 chance</i>
<i> he gives the information</i>
<i> you seek.</i>

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:34.116
<i> Regardless,</i>
<i> you have 36 hours</i>

01:02:34.118 --> 01:02:38.120
<i> until you need to officially</i>
<i> report to your co at</i>
<i> the batumi-gazsnab station.</i>

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:40.355
<i> Good hunting.</i>

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:46.461
I'm looking for
mothershed.

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:48.830
You've found him.

01:02:50.566 --> 01:02:52.000
Zotov sent me.
He said you could...

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:56.004
Help you, yes.

01:02:56.006 --> 01:02:58.006
Zotov told me
all about you.

01:02:58.008 --> 01:03:01.076
You're a cowboy and
you want gazakov.

01:03:01.078 --> 01:03:04.312
Yeah, I do. Zotov said
you can get me to him.

01:03:04.314 --> 01:03:05.781
It's suicide.

01:03:06.749 --> 01:03:08.183
Can you do it, or not?

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.187
Let's say I can
help you to find him.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:16.191
What then?

01:03:16.193 --> 01:03:19.494
Are you gonna ask him
who his source is?
Well, that's a start.

01:03:21.764 --> 01:03:25.867
I trade for it. Quid pro quo.
His sister's husband
was a spotter.

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:29.037
Yeah. We blew him to bits.

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:32.674
Well, what wouldn't gazakov
give up in exchange for his
brother-in-law's remains?

01:03:32.676 --> 01:03:35.177
Decapitating you, for one.

01:03:35.179 --> 01:03:38.713
I'm willing to take that risk.
Man-to-man, it's worth a shot.

01:03:38.715 --> 01:03:40.448
No, it's not.

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:41.883
Well, that's your opinion.

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:45.921
I'm paid to have
intelligent ones.

01:03:45.923 --> 01:03:48.456
Can you get the remains
for me, or not?
I wanna leave by sunrise.

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:56.231
Then I guess we better not
waste any time.

01:03:56.233 --> 01:03:57.265
What's this?

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:01.837
The peace offering
you requested.

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:06.141
When I talked to zotov,
i knew how all of this
was gonna end up.

01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:08.944
That's all that's
left of him?

01:04:08.946 --> 01:04:12.380
After a direct hit
by a hellfire missile, yes.

01:04:15.751 --> 01:04:16.918
Right.

01:04:17.653 --> 01:04:19.354
We'll leave by sunup.

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:59.728
What officially is your job
with the pipeline, anyway?

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:00.662
Hear that?

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:02.964
I don't hear anything.

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:06.234
Mq-1 predator drone.

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:10.272
Say "cheese" before we
end up in a cigar box.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.918
We have
multiple heat signatures.

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:28.623
Get the colonel.
I've got something.

01:05:30.993 --> 01:05:34.162
Officially,
I'm a geologist.
A geologist?

01:05:34.164 --> 01:05:38.500
Oil and natural gas
makes the world go round,
my friend.

01:05:38.502 --> 01:05:43.772
The trans-Georgian pipeline
is the biggest geopolitical
game in town.

01:05:43.774 --> 01:05:46.141
All the major players
are at the table.

01:05:46.909 --> 01:05:50.645
You, me, gazakov,

01:05:50.647 --> 01:05:52.447
we don't even
rank as pawns.

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:02.724
We are close.

01:06:03.759 --> 01:06:05.527
How do you know?

01:06:05.529 --> 01:06:07.562
They have been tracking us
for the past hour.

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:10.065
What are we doing then?

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.435
Waiting for them
to introduce themselves.

01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:20.075
What have you got?

01:06:20.077 --> 01:06:23.078
Potential hostiles,
possible high-value
individuals.

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.413
Are you sure?
Can't confirm, sir.

01:06:49.872 --> 01:06:51.072
They're here.

01:06:58.681 --> 01:06:59.514
Put your hands up.

01:07:00.282 --> 01:07:01.449
I'm not giving up my gun.

01:07:02.218 --> 01:07:04.185
Then you will die.

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:05.653
Give me the cigar box
and wait here.

01:07:08.325 --> 01:07:09.357
Hello.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:11.526
Peace be with you.

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:13.395
We brought you the remains
of Shaheed niazof.

01:07:15.898 --> 01:07:18.199
He's grateful for the remains
of his brother.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:20.635
Now he can give him
a proper islamic burial.

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:24.239
Colonel, I think
you should see this.

01:07:28.244 --> 01:07:30.145
What am I looking at?

01:07:30.147 --> 01:07:31.379
Sourcing targets.

01:07:32.481 --> 01:07:34.916
Facial recognition
is impossible, sir.

01:07:34.918 --> 01:07:38.753
They're masked, but our
guys down there tell us this
is definitely gazakov country.

01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:42.424
How do I know
it's not a Shepherd
tending his flock?

01:07:42.426 --> 01:07:47.128
Last time I checked,
Shepherds didn't need
a belt-fed machine gun, sir.

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:57.072
He says it was god's will
that he was able to escape
the drone attack.

01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:02.210
Ask him who gave him
the coordinates
of the sniper team.

01:08:09.453 --> 01:08:11.352
He says
it was god's gift.

01:08:11.354 --> 01:08:15.490
It was not he who
killed the infidel,
but god's hand.

01:08:15.492 --> 01:08:16.524
He's lying.

01:08:17.626 --> 01:08:19.127
Brandon, be careful.

01:08:22.997 --> 01:08:24.499
His talent is
god's given.

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:26.868
This is an insult.

01:08:43.219 --> 01:08:47.354
I do not lie.

01:08:48.657 --> 01:08:51.392
Is the drone armed?
Fully armed.

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:54.261
Of course.

01:08:54.264 --> 01:08:56.598
Forgive us. He meant
no disrespect.

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:00.635
We will win this war.

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:03.104
Maybe not in my lifetime...

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.675
But in my children's
and my children's children.

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:09.911
We'll win.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:17.252
Now, go. I'll kill you
another day.

01:09:22.258 --> 01:09:24.759
There's no way he could've
made those shots
without coordinates.

01:09:24.761 --> 01:09:26.027
Ask him
how he got them.

01:09:26.029 --> 01:09:27.529
Brandon, stop.
Ask him.

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:31.432
Without the exact coordinates,

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:33.468
you wouldn't have been able
to kill the sniper.

01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:34.903
Who gave you that information?

01:09:37.973 --> 01:09:39.640
He seeks the same
justice as you.

01:09:45.648 --> 01:09:46.848
You forget yourself,
American.

01:09:48.216 --> 01:09:49.216
Take him out.

01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:17.312
Ah...

01:10:51.614 --> 01:10:55.617
I wish someone
would've told me about
this bone-headed move,

01:10:55.619 --> 01:10:58.686
so I could've said
"no fucking way."

01:10:58.688 --> 01:11:00.455
Until I went up there,
i didn't know
who I could trust.

01:11:03.126 --> 01:11:05.927
And you sat down
with gazakov?

01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:08.329
We didn't actually sit.

01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:11.566
Okay, so,
what did you learn?

01:11:11.568 --> 01:11:14.202
From gazakov? Nothing.

01:11:14.204 --> 01:11:16.004
He just holds the rifle
while god guides his hand.

01:11:16.839 --> 01:11:19.307
But I noticed something
interesting.

01:11:19.309 --> 01:11:22.777
One of his militants
carries a toughbook
wrapped around his shoulder.

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:24.946
<i> Never stopped looking at it.</i>

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:28.683
A computer toughbook?
With a satellite uplink.

01:11:28.685 --> 01:11:31.919
That's a pretty serious piece
of hardware for a militant,
don't you think?

01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:37.725
You think gazakov fixed
your units' locations
with our very own drones,

01:11:37.727 --> 01:11:41.229
using equipment they could
buy off of Amazon?

01:11:41.231 --> 01:11:45.633
No. We think
they have mirrored your
drone network, real time.

01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:48.136
Impossible.

01:11:48.138 --> 01:11:50.972
Improbable, yes,
but not impossible.

01:11:54.209 --> 01:11:55.009
This is Robin.

01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:56.811
Yes, sir.

01:11:58.347 --> 01:11:59.380
He's right here.

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:03.918
It's for you.

01:12:09.892 --> 01:12:11.626
<i> Hold the line,</i>
<i> Beckett.</i>

01:12:15.031 --> 01:12:16.698
This is Zeus.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.901
Are we secure?
Yes, sir.

01:12:19.903 --> 01:12:22.570
Somebody wanna tell me
what the fuck is going on?

01:12:22.572 --> 01:12:24.038
<i> I don't understand, sir.</i>

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:27.175
<i> Well, sergeant Beckett</i>
<i> went off the reservation</i>

01:12:27.177 --> 01:12:30.345
had an unsanctioned,
unauthorized meet
with gazakov.

01:12:30.347 --> 01:12:31.779
First I've heard of it.

01:12:31.781 --> 01:12:33.181
Is this how you
run your men, major?

01:12:33.183 --> 01:12:34.916
No, sir. It's not.

01:12:34.918 --> 01:12:38.820
Gunnery sergeant Beckett,
do you wanna be taken
out of the field permanently?

01:12:38.822 --> 01:12:42.357
Just say the word,
so I can put you in a desk
in thumb-fucked Egypt.

01:12:42.359 --> 01:12:43.891
No, sir.

01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:45.526
<i> You're riding</i>
<i> the edge, son.</i>

01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:47.729
I can only cover your back
for so long.

01:12:47.731 --> 01:12:50.064
They're watching
our drone surveillance
live feeds somehow.

01:12:50.066 --> 01:12:52.133
That's impossible.

01:12:52.135 --> 01:12:55.103
They don't have
the brainpower or the hardware
to mirror our drone network.

01:12:55.105 --> 01:12:58.339
System logon credentials
are bought and sold
on the black market.

01:12:58.341 --> 01:13:00.742
Nothing digital is
completely secure.

01:13:00.744 --> 01:13:03.845
What you're suggesting
doesn't even attain
the level of a hunch.

01:13:03.847 --> 01:13:05.813
<i> Listen to me.</i>

01:13:05.815 --> 01:13:08.683
You stick to the missions,
I'll handle the intel.

01:13:08.685 --> 01:13:10.651
<i> I don't wanna have</i>
<i> this talk again.</i>

01:13:10.653 --> 01:13:14.288
As for you, major,
run your team, do not
let your team run you.

01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:15.790
Yes, sir.

01:13:15.792 --> 01:13:19.160
Sergeant Beckett,
i want you back on the
black sea with your crew.

01:13:19.162 --> 01:13:22.764
<i> We've got another archangel</i>
<i> operation for Killian grun.</i>

01:13:22.766 --> 01:13:26.167
Now, I don't want this one
to turn into another shit show
like the last one did.

01:13:26.169 --> 01:13:27.568
<i> Do you hear me, major?</i>

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:30.204
Yes, sir.
Shit show, last one.

01:13:30.206 --> 01:13:34.509
Good. I'm counting on you.
Now get back to work.

01:14:46.648 --> 01:14:48.850
Well, hey. Welcome back
to the party.

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:51.819
I thought you went
awol on us, brother.

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:54.789
They put me on ice for a bit.
Where's Barnes and aungst?

01:14:54.791 --> 01:14:58.326
Radio silence since 0900.
Next scheduled
check-in is 1400.

01:14:58.328 --> 01:15:00.161
Mountains and ravines, man.

01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:02.597
We gotta find 'em.
They're gonna be used
for target practice.

01:15:34.429 --> 01:15:35.930
Zeus, I got nothing.

01:15:35.932 --> 01:15:37.932
Intel says
gazakov's here somewhere.

01:15:37.934 --> 01:15:40.334
We're here for
long-range support.

01:15:40.336 --> 01:15:43.771
Let them do
their thing, suicide.
Troop's 90 seconds out.

01:15:59.355 --> 01:16:02.023
Sniper team in grove
to the south, confirming
the coordinates.

01:16:02.025 --> 01:16:04.659
One man alone
on hill to north.

01:16:04.661 --> 01:16:06.861
South grove, right side?

01:16:06.863 --> 01:16:08.596
Yes, god willing.

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:17.004
Georgian troops, dirt road
at your 10 o'clock.

01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:24.111
Draw out the snipers.

01:16:30.787 --> 01:16:32.420
Shots fired.
Troops have contact.

01:16:32.422 --> 01:16:34.088
Where the hell
is that shooter?

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:36.691
I can't find him.
Fuck! Neither can I.

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:44.999
Find me a target.

01:17:17.533 --> 01:17:19.000
Sniper team, 500 meters
to your 2 o'clock.

01:17:26.341 --> 01:17:27.675
Shot came from
my direct front.

01:17:30.445 --> 01:17:31.979
White house,
second-story window.

01:17:49.598 --> 01:17:51.399
Argh! We've got a casualty!

01:17:51.401 --> 01:17:52.400
Range 2800 meters.

01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:02.877
Damn it.
We got to move, major!

01:18:04.112 --> 01:18:05.046
I'm with you.

01:18:08.717 --> 01:18:09.884
You're good.
Zeus!

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:15.122
Peel, peel!

01:18:18.827 --> 01:18:20.261
The vest, take it off.

01:18:20.263 --> 01:18:21.696
What?

01:18:21.698 --> 01:18:23.030
Our GPS has been
compromised.

01:18:26.868 --> 01:18:29.470
Stay with me.
Please, please.

01:18:29.472 --> 01:18:32.339
Suicide, this is Zeus.
Take off your vest.
GPS compromised.

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:38.012
Let's move!

01:18:43.186 --> 01:18:44.819
Move, let's get
out of here now!

01:18:47.122 --> 01:18:48.723
Stay with me, aungst.
Let's go.

01:19:12.347 --> 01:19:13.514
She's lost
a lot of blood!

01:19:29.599 --> 01:19:30.965
All clear.

01:19:37.506 --> 01:19:39.073
March, quickly!

01:19:39.075 --> 01:19:40.908
How're we doing, major?

01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:43.410
Better since we
ditched the vests
and the GPS trackers.

01:19:43.412 --> 01:19:44.345
It nearly
saved our lives.

01:19:56.491 --> 01:19:58.759
What have we got?

01:19:58.761 --> 01:20:01.862
This was a setup, sir.
They've definitely
hacked our network.

01:20:01.864 --> 01:20:04.165
Enough about
the drones, Brandon.

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.935
I'm telling you, they can
see what we can see.

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:11.005
This is your problem,
major.

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.841
No, it is
our problem, Robin.

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:17.678
The colonel
is a good friend.

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:21.482
I can't imagine he'll be
pleased to read the reports
I'll be sending to Brussels

01:20:21.484 --> 01:20:24.618
regarding cfc operations
in my country.

01:20:37.299 --> 01:20:38.899
Attention on deck.

01:20:40.569 --> 01:20:41.435
As you were.

01:20:44.306 --> 01:20:46.040
What the hell
happened out there?

01:20:46.042 --> 01:20:49.043
We got a tip on
unsecured radio traffic

01:20:49.045 --> 01:20:51.779
that gazakov was
holed up in a village
just west of here.

01:20:51.781 --> 01:20:57.218
We humped in, set up.
Turns out, it was a trap.

01:20:57.220 --> 01:21:02.857
They had our positions
totally dialed in. GPS was
completely compromised.

01:21:02.859 --> 01:21:05.359
Senior airman aungst
was clipped.

01:21:05.361 --> 01:21:07.528
She's on a flight to Germany
to get patched up.

01:21:08.964 --> 01:21:13.234
Perhaps gunny's
drone story was true.

01:21:16.805 --> 01:21:20.074
I have my orders,
too, gentlemen, and we
don't have a lot of time.

01:21:20.842 --> 01:21:20.841
I'll check into it.

01:21:24.212 --> 01:21:27.281
We're gonna hit them back
and we're gonna
hit them back hard.

01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:30.317
Shut down GPS,
are we clear?

01:21:30.952 --> 01:21:32.119
Yes, sir.

01:21:33.154 --> 01:21:34.355
Carry on, marines.

01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:53.374
<i> Killian grun</i>
<i> is here to observe operation</i>
<i> archangel in action.</i>

01:21:54.209 --> 01:21:56.877
<i> Destroy gazakov</i>
<i> and his forces</i>

01:21:56.879 --> 01:22:02.416
<i> who continue operating in</i>
<i> kobuleti and Southern Georgia.</i>

01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:08.122
All these areas have seen
increasing attacks by Isis
on ngo workers and civilians.

01:22:11.359 --> 01:22:13.928
As you can see
in your packet,

01:22:13.930 --> 01:22:16.430
this is current
satellite photography

01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:19.566
indicating gazakov and his
men are near kobuleti,

01:22:19.568 --> 01:22:22.469
preparing to attack
this station here tomorrow,

01:22:22.471 --> 01:22:26.140
<i> destroying it and</i>
<i> killing all personnel.</i>

01:22:26.142 --> 01:22:31.545
<i> We estimate there are</i>
<i> 40 to 50 enemy combatants in</i>
<i> the kobuleti area as of now.</i>

01:22:31.547 --> 01:22:33.414
<i> They are aware of</i>
<i> archangel's arrival here,</i>

01:22:33.416 --> 01:22:35.215
<i> which is further</i>
<i> incentive to hit us.</i>

01:22:35.217 --> 01:22:38.686
<i> As you know,</i>
<i> gazakov and his ilk</i>
<i> are bad people.</i>

01:22:38.688 --> 01:22:41.855
<i> They don't differentiate</i>
<i> between hard and soft targets</i>

01:22:41.857 --> 01:22:45.960
and are known for
hitting resorts, restaurants,
big tourist attractions.

01:22:48.496 --> 01:22:49.530
My god!

01:22:50.865 --> 01:22:52.533
Recommendations?

01:22:52.535 --> 01:22:55.970
Evacuate all non-essential
personnel at your
kobuleti offices.

01:22:55.972 --> 01:22:59.173
Intercept and engage
the insurgents before
they're able to get here.

01:23:06.915 --> 01:23:09.550
How many additional
troops can we put on
the grounds there?

01:23:09.552 --> 01:23:13.053
Given our timeframe,
not many. But we can
augment a number of uavs.

01:23:13.055 --> 01:23:17.157
Two more units in the air
by nightfall doubles
our firepower.

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:20.060
<i> We're going to intercept</i>
<i> them in kobuleti before</i>
<i> they get here.</i>

01:23:23.331 --> 01:23:25.165
You really think
that's a good idea?

01:23:25.167 --> 01:23:26.600
I think it's our only idea.

01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:31.705
What if Beckett is right?
What if they're in our system?

01:23:31.707 --> 01:23:33.841
What if they can see
what we can see?

01:23:33.843 --> 01:23:35.042
They're not.

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:39.146
And you are
100% sure of that?

01:23:39.148 --> 01:23:42.983
I'd rather be 80% sure early
than 100% sure too late.

01:23:42.985 --> 01:23:45.719
Point taken, major.
That's why we're
not using GPS.

01:23:49.758 --> 01:23:52.659
All right.
We know our role here.
We don't like it.

01:23:52.661 --> 01:23:54.928
We don't make the missions,
we execute them.

01:23:54.930 --> 01:23:57.131
You got a problem with that,
keep it to yourself.

01:23:57.133 --> 01:23:58.832
What about our web gear?
Are we going off grid?

01:23:58.834 --> 01:24:00.868
They recommended
modification.

01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:02.770
If you haven't
done it already,
remove your GPS.

01:24:02.772 --> 01:24:04.071
We pull out 0300.

01:24:07.308 --> 01:24:09.410
What was
the evidence of insurgent
movement towards kobuleti?

01:24:09.978 --> 01:24:11.879
Drones.

01:24:11.881 --> 01:24:14.314
And what's there
in kobuleti?

01:24:14.316 --> 01:24:16.617
Gazsnab home office.
Soft targets.

01:24:17.619 --> 01:24:19.486
Well, what's in batumi?

01:24:19.488 --> 01:24:21.455
You know what's in batumi,
gunny. We were just there.

01:24:21.457 --> 01:24:23.057
They're hitting it
tomorrow.

01:24:23.059 --> 01:24:25.225
Exactly.

01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:29.029
We just left the master
pumping station for the
entire black sea transfer.

01:24:29.031 --> 01:24:32.433
If it gets hit, 900 kilometers
of pipeline will be lost.

01:24:34.102 --> 01:24:37.404
All right. But I saw
the insurgent movement
with my own eyes.

01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:39.640
They are headed
towards kobuleti.

01:24:39.642 --> 01:24:43.377
But how are the coordinates
transmitted? Let me guess,
the drone network.

01:24:46.515 --> 01:24:47.948
Can you tell me the location
of the enemy sniper team?

01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:50.084
By god's greatness, yes.

01:24:50.086 --> 01:24:54.488
No GPS data now, but they were
observed leaving gazsnab.

01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:58.525
Then they believe
we are assembling in kobuleti?

01:24:58.527 --> 01:25:01.762
Yes, seems so. Streaming
false information was simple.

01:25:05.133 --> 01:25:07.734
Georgian forces
are riding out to engage
the enemy,

01:25:07.736 --> 01:25:11.605
but that leaves Killian grun
and the pumping station
vulnerable to attack.

01:25:11.607 --> 01:25:14.508
It's a head fake, sir.
Tomorrow is today.

01:25:15.176 --> 01:25:16.743
Call the colonel.

01:25:16.745 --> 01:25:18.645
We lost our uplink
15 clicks back, sir.

01:25:20.548 --> 01:25:21.715
Well, then, turn it around.

01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:25.219
Turn it around.

01:25:25.221 --> 01:25:26.587
You better be right.

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:33.253
What if it's more than
GPS data? What if they can
see what we can see?

01:26:35.056 --> 01:26:37.691
<i> I don't know</i>
<i> what to say, colonel.</i>
<i> Our guys have checked.</i>

01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:39.726
<i> If they're getting</i>
<i> information, it's from</i>
<i> another source.</i>

01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:45.399
Well, it's too quiet.
Something's not right.

01:26:45.401 --> 01:26:47.568
I can feel it
in my bones.

01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:51.471
I don't fully trust bones.
I trust zeroes and ones.

01:26:58.380 --> 01:26:59.746
No indication of
enemy sniper teams
or support troops.

01:26:59.748 --> 01:27:02.015
Our infrared heat signatures
are suppressed.

01:27:02.017 --> 01:27:05.719
Send a message to the others.
Grun must be taken alive.

01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:18.565
This game is binary.
It's all about hard intel.

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:20.400
Mm-hmm.

01:27:31.879 --> 01:27:33.313
My god!
What is it?

01:27:38.286 --> 01:27:39.253
Are you okay?

01:27:41.222 --> 01:27:42.289
Ah!

01:27:45.827 --> 01:27:48.262
Gunny Beckett was right.
They pulled data
off of our uav net!

01:27:51.566 --> 01:27:53.267
Get command on the line
for reinforcements.

01:27:56.137 --> 01:27:58.171
Get him the fuck
out of here now!

01:28:07.649 --> 01:28:09.316
Argh!

01:28:09.318 --> 01:28:11.151
Cfc command,
this is Robin slater,

01:28:11.153 --> 01:28:14.354
ID code
0-2-niner-green-8-0-9.

01:28:14.356 --> 01:28:17.624
We are under attack.
I repeat,
we are under attack.

01:28:25.266 --> 01:28:28.769
Cancel all uav overflight
batumi, Georgia.

01:28:28.771 --> 01:28:32.105
Cancel all cfc
aircraft, over.

01:28:32.107 --> 01:28:35.375
Authorization for grounding
uav assets on hold
for further review.

01:28:35.377 --> 01:28:38.278
"Further review"?
Ground them now.

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:40.347
They're pulling data
off our network and
who knows what else.

01:29:01.836 --> 01:29:03.870
- Just park it anywhere.
- Find a hide now.

01:29:20.189 --> 01:29:22.956
Really, guys? Who wants
their balls cut off first?

01:29:31.866 --> 01:29:32.966
I need a mag.

01:29:37.372 --> 01:29:38.872
Zeus, this is rampage.

01:29:38.874 --> 01:29:41.308
We're on glass, gone quiet,
have engaged the target, over.

01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:43.677
I don't remember giving
you permission to go live,
rampage.

01:29:43.679 --> 01:29:46.046
My bad.
Now merc those
motherfuckers.

01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:52.886
Snipers. Find them.

01:30:20.148 --> 01:30:22.249
Suicide, have you
made contact?

01:30:22.251 --> 01:30:23.850
Suicide is shaking hands
with the devil, sir.

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:26.920
Well, raise hell, boys.

01:30:31.826 --> 01:30:33.160
Mortar team, bro,
my 11 o'clock.

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:43.136
Authorization
approved, Ms. slater.
Clearing your airspace now.

01:30:48.376 --> 01:30:50.076
We've lost our infrared.

01:30:50.078 --> 01:30:52.078
Keep looking.

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:55.015
Find me gazakov.
He's here. I can feel him.

01:30:58.319 --> 01:30:59.219
No, get down!

01:31:04.425 --> 01:31:06.026
Way ahead of you, bro.
My one.

01:31:08.896 --> 01:31:10.096
Not him.

01:31:10.098 --> 01:31:11.598
Who cares?
Drop the fucking muji.

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:25.145
Where are you?

01:31:38.025 --> 01:31:39.860
We got a rabbit, bro.
Gazakov on the move.

01:32:00.515 --> 01:32:01.648
Oh, shit!

01:32:07.054 --> 01:32:09.122
Fuck! Oh, fuck me!

01:32:09.124 --> 01:32:11.291
Are you okay, pal?

01:32:11.293 --> 01:32:14.261
Yeah, just stay on glass
and waste that fuck.

01:33:13.621 --> 01:33:15.689
Rampage,
what's your status?

01:33:15.691 --> 01:33:18.158
This is rampage.
Hostile threat down.

01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:19.793
I need a medic!

01:33:23.831 --> 01:33:25.632
You should see
the other guy.

01:33:36.677 --> 01:33:37.644
Good work, son.
Thank you, sir.

01:33:37.646 --> 01:33:38.812
Brandon, a word.

01:33:47.555 --> 01:33:52.225
Long time ago, I told your
father all he had was killing.

01:33:53.861 --> 01:33:57.697
I was wrong. He had courage
and he had grit.

01:33:59.767 --> 01:34:01.101
You are your
father's son, gunny.

01:34:02.903 --> 01:34:04.204
I'll see you
in the next one.

01:34:13.114 --> 01:34:14.114
See you.

01:35:00.728 --> 01:35:03.029
It's good to be back, boys.
I missed you guys.

01:35:03.898 --> 01:35:06.466
That's what
i like to see, a team.

01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:11.304
Pulled a Houdini on us
back there, top.

01:35:11.306 --> 01:35:13.073
Oh, you know how it is.
Things to do.

01:35:14.642 --> 01:35:17.043
But I wanted to stop by
and say, "job well done."

01:35:18.879 --> 01:35:20.280
That means a lot
coming from you, sir.

01:35:22.016 --> 01:35:25.051
But I thought I should
tell you guys that I'm
putting in for a transfer.

01:35:25.053 --> 01:35:27.253
I thought you were retired.

01:35:27.255 --> 01:35:29.756
I'll be retired in
a different kind of way.

01:35:29.758 --> 01:35:33.560
I'll still be with the cfc,
but in direct
field operations.

01:35:33.562 --> 01:35:35.328
Keep a better eye
on you guys.

01:35:37.998 --> 01:35:39.966
Hey, I brought someone
to see you.

01:35:48.609 --> 01:35:50.176
Colonel,
pull up a seat.

01:36:05.626 --> 01:36:06.860
You were right.

01:36:08.295 --> 01:36:09.362
I was wrong.

01:36:11.799 --> 01:36:12.966
You were just
doing your job.

01:36:17.605 --> 01:36:18.905
Buy you a drink?

01:36:19.874 --> 01:36:22.075
Yeah, I'd like that.
