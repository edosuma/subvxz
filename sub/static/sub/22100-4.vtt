15:49.157 --> 15:50.490
You're only human.
No!

15:50.575 --> 15:52.993
Don't say that!
Tell me I frakked up!

15:53.077 --> 15:54.369
Say it!

15:54.579 --> 15:56.371
Tell me I frakked up!

15:57.290 --> 15:58.790
Any one of you.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.375
Cowards!

16:02.253 --> 16:04.087
Chief, I can handle this.

16:04.172 --> 16:06.465
Why don't you take
a little down time?

16:08.593 --> 16:10.636
Get out of the Raptor,
Figurski.

16:30.281 --> 16:34.076
NO. 6: People have room in their
hearts for one great belief,

16:34.911 --> 16:37.079
you or the old Gods.

16:37.455 --> 16:39.414
Which one will it be?

16:44.295 --> 16:46.463
Why can't I just be a man?

16:47.840 --> 16:50.342
Do I really need to take on
the Gods single-handed?

16:50.426 --> 16:54.513
But imagine the kind of man
you'll be when you do.

16:55.306 --> 17:01.603
Surely such a man must be magnificent,
larger-than-life, Godlike himself.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.189
What are you
talking about?

17:05.858 --> 17:08.527
It's not about
that at all.

17:14.659 --> 17:16.493
It's about this.

17:20.581 --> 17:22.124
(SIGHING)

17:22.875 --> 17:24.501
Stop!

17:25.169 --> 17:26.962
Stop.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.341
This is unacceptable.

17:32.802 --> 17:36.638
We have been targeted
because of what we believe

17:36.723 --> 17:41.226
by those who answer to faceless Gods
that bear no relevance in our world.

17:42.353 --> 17:44.521
They want us to be afraid.

17:46.190 --> 17:48.942
And I'm tired of
being afraid.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.864
The time has come
to make a stand.

17:55.116 --> 17:57.492
And that time is now.

18:00.246 --> 18:03.623
Gaius, what are you doing?
Where are you going?

18:05.293 --> 18:06.710
WOMAN: Gaius?

18:10.047 --> 18:12.924
BALTAR: We want justice,
not these stupid old Gods!

18:13.718 --> 18:15.135
Sir, we're having
a service.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.763
Are you? But whom
are you serving?

18:18.139 --> 18:19.598
I have to ask you to leave.
Do you?

18:19.682 --> 18:21.099
Would you be serving Zeus?

18:21.184 --> 18:23.226
Apparently, king of the Gods,
who also happened to be,

18:23.352 --> 18:25.312
let me tell you,
a serial rapist.

18:25.354 --> 18:28.023
(PEOPLE GASPING) Prone to giving
birth out of his own forehead.

18:28.149 --> 18:29.608
That's very likely, isn't it?

18:29.692 --> 18:31.318
(PEOPLE PROTESTING)
Well, Gods strike me down.

18:31.402 --> 18:32.736
What are you going to do?
Damn you.

18:32.820 --> 18:36.031
You ignorant witch, telling
the people lies and stories.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.408
Maybe you want me
to pray to Asclepius,

18:38.493 --> 18:40.494
who healed wounds with
the blood of Gorgons,

18:40.578 --> 18:44.664
or Aphrodite or Artemis
or any other of this rubbish!

18:44.749 --> 18:46.666
(ALL SHOUTING)

18:46.751 --> 18:49.753
How awful! Out of the way,
you hideous old witch.

18:50.505 --> 18:52.923
That's the kind of rubbish
that you made!

18:53.007 --> 18:55.342
I will not be destroyed
on this level!

18:57.386 --> 18:59.137
(SCREAMING)

19:00.014 --> 19:02.265
I'm with God already.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.025
Am I that late?

19:12.109 --> 19:15.570
No, this wasn't a treatment.
It was just a blood test.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.696
You brought a new book?

19:16.781 --> 19:18.824
Yes. Something
different this time.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.909
It's a classic,
my favorite.

19:20.993 --> 19:25.872
Searider Falcon, I haven't read it in
years. I don't remember how it ends.

19:25.957 --> 19:27.999
I don't either.
I never read the ending.

19:28.084 --> 19:29.584
You're kidding.
It's your favorite.

19:29.669 --> 19:33.171
I like it so much,
I don't want it to be over.

19:33.714 --> 19:34.881
So I'm saving it.

19:34.966 --> 19:36.550
Maybe I should do that.

19:40.805 --> 19:42.931
That's a bad idea.
Maybe not.

19:45.476 --> 19:47.102
Let me do that for you.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.937
Okay, thanks.

19:51.107 --> 19:54.526
Baltar's back at home
in the brig again.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.528
Desecration of a temple.

19:56.612 --> 19:59.698
It's his revenge for what
happened to him this morning.

19:59.782 --> 20:01.032
It was brutal.

20:01.701 --> 20:05.704
I have my personnel trying to track
down anything on the Sons of Ares.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.038
But nobody's talking.

20:07.123 --> 20:10.709
The thing is that Baltar knows that there
are religious hardliners in Dogsville,

20:10.793 --> 20:12.836
but he continues to provoke.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.922
I just can't have a
religious war in this fleet.

20:16.007 --> 20:17.382
Please, no.

20:17.466 --> 20:18.758
Then the whole damn
thing will become

20:18.843 --> 20:20.719
our frakking responsibility,
yours and mine.

20:20.803 --> 20:23.847
Seriously, Bill, we have 30,000
people left, and they're not happy

20:23.931 --> 20:26.099
unless they're kicking
each other's teeth in.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.642
This is what we've become?

20:27.727 --> 20:29.561
No, it's him.

20:30.021 --> 20:34.232
Baltar has an uncanny way of
stirring up all the crap.

20:35.401 --> 20:39.029
I wonder if he'd be willing
to stay in lockdown,

20:39.113 --> 20:41.239
indefinitely,
for his own safety.

20:41.991 --> 20:44.284
And make a martyr
out of him? No way.

20:44.452 --> 20:49.831
Those girly, groupie, sex whatever-they-are,
they already think he's a God.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.750
So we'll kick him
off of the Galactica.

20:51.834 --> 20:53.919
No, I want him close.

20:55.004 --> 20:56.838
I'm going to the brig.

20:57.340 --> 20:58.840
You want to see him?

20:59.425 --> 21:01.176
I want him to see me.

21:07.850 --> 21:10.894
We didn't even make it
to tomorrow, did we?

21:10.978 --> 21:12.979
You asked what I want.

21:13.814 --> 21:17.943
I want to know how it feels to have
killed billions of human beings,

21:18.027 --> 21:20.528
to have all that blood
on your hands.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.949
Think it through.

21:24.367 --> 21:26.284
Because that's what I want.

21:28.871 --> 21:31.957
I feel it. Do you really
think that I couldn't?

21:32.041 --> 21:33.583
Do you?

21:34.251 --> 21:36.127
Or do you turn it off?

21:36.212 --> 21:39.756
Is there a switch in your
head that you turn off?

21:39.840 --> 21:43.301
You talk like we're different,
but you know we're not.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.514
Weapons.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.440
Working late, or up early, Chief?

22:22.883 --> 22:26.636
You act like you think I'm
made of switches and relays.

22:26.721 --> 22:28.346
Look.

22:28.431 --> 22:30.849
Veins, not wires.

22:30.933 --> 22:32.475
We're the same.

22:38.482 --> 22:40.442
Do you see we're the same?

22:44.363 --> 22:46.239
Then tell me.

22:46.949 --> 22:48.950
Tell you what?

22:50.494 --> 22:52.871
How you live with
what you've done.

22:54.957 --> 22:56.207
Saul,

22:58.335 --> 23:01.504
are you asking
for absolution?

23:02.423 --> 23:03.965
(SOFTLY) Forgiveness?

23:05.676 --> 23:07.886
I can give you that.

23:09.305 --> 23:10.805
Stand down.

23:12.308 --> 23:13.808
Step outside.

23:21.817 --> 23:24.027
Just tell me
what the trouble is.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.368
You have nothing
to offer me.

23:33.871 --> 23:35.705
We're not the same.

23:38.459 --> 23:40.001
(DOOR OPENING)

23:41.170 --> 23:43.046
Were you asleep?

23:43.130 --> 23:44.714
What is it this time?

23:45.841 --> 23:47.634
Here to strip search me?

23:48.761 --> 23:51.096
Or could it possibly be
that your presence here

23:51.180 --> 23:55.600
means that the President has
been made aware of my situation.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.936
It's being looked into.

23:58.020 --> 23:59.062
Is it really?

23:59.146 --> 24:00.188
Aggressively.

24:00.731 --> 24:02.524
Now here's the thing.

24:06.403 --> 24:09.322
I want you to
look at me, Gaius.

24:09.406 --> 24:11.032
Just look at me.

24:14.161 --> 24:15.703
This is a wig.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.000
I'm dying.

24:23.212 --> 24:26.172
Now, if you look
in my eyes...

24:26.257 --> 24:27.715
Go ahead, look.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.551
You can probably see it.

24:31.387 --> 24:32.387
I'm very sorry.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.847
No, no, no, no,
I don't want your pity.

24:33.931 --> 24:34.973
I'm still doing my job.

24:35.057 --> 24:39.602
In fact, I'm gonna aggressively
pursue the men that attacked you.

24:39.687 --> 24:45.650
And I'm going to limit the size of
public assemblies to protect your people,

24:45.734 --> 24:49.195
but I'm going to be slipping
away from this life very soon.

24:49.280 --> 24:52.574
(WHISPERING) And I've gotten kind of
curious as to what that's going to be like,

24:52.658 --> 24:54.701
and so I did some research.

24:54.785 --> 24:56.327
And there are some
people who say that

24:56.412 --> 24:58.329
when people are getting
closer to their death,

24:58.414 --> 25:03.835
they just don't care as much about
rules and laws and conventional morality.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.170
Are you threatening me?

25:05.254 --> 25:08.173
No, no, I'm just saying
have a quiet life,

25:09.175 --> 25:11.968
and I'll die
a quiet little death,

25:12.052 --> 25:14.012
and everyone will be happy.

25:15.222 --> 25:19.142
It's just that I'm not in the
mood any longer to indulge you.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.186
And that's...

25:24.190 --> 25:25.648
all.

25:29.361 --> 25:32.989
And you are
being released,

25:33.073 --> 25:34.449
so stay safe.

25:39.997 --> 25:42.123
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

25:51.842 --> 25:53.635
Hey, Chief.

25:54.428 --> 25:55.428
(EXHALES)

25:55.512 --> 25:56.721
MAN: Hey, Admiral.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.311
We all miss her, Chief.

26:04.521 --> 26:07.148
I understand if you
need some time off.

26:07.233 --> 26:11.277
Or even if you might need more
shifts to keep yourself busy.

26:11.362 --> 26:13.529
No one knows how they're going
to react to a loss like this,

26:13.614 --> 26:15.406
or what they're gonna need.

26:16.742 --> 26:18.952
I don't need
special treatment.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.500
I guess she just
couldn't take it, huh?

26:26.001 --> 26:27.502
Being married to a Cylon?

26:27.586 --> 26:30.171
Being the mother of a
half-breed abomination?

26:36.553 --> 26:38.263
MAN: Here you go, sir.
Thank you.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.018
She was a good woman.

26:50.859 --> 26:55.196
If you really believe that,
you wouldn't have threatened

26:55.281 --> 26:58.366
to stick her up against
a bulkhead and shoot her.

27:01.578 --> 27:03.246
It's okay, though.

27:04.373 --> 27:06.582
I thought about doing it
many times myself.

27:06.667 --> 27:08.251
Believe me.
Chief, it's...

27:08.335 --> 27:12.046
How many of us ended up with the
people we really wanted to be with?

27:13.757 --> 27:16.884
Got stuck with the
best of limited options?

27:17.886 --> 27:19.512
And why?

27:20.806 --> 27:27.145
Because the ones we really wanted,
the really loved, were dead and dying,

27:28.397 --> 27:30.064
or turned out to be Cylons
and they didn't know it.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.524
(HUFFING) If Boomer had...

27:33.944 --> 27:34.986
Listen...
If I had known...

27:35.070 --> 27:36.321
Listen, let's...
No.

27:36.405 --> 27:38.740
Let's go.
No, no.

27:39.325 --> 27:40.616
I didn't know.

27:40.701 --> 27:42.660
Let's go home.
I didn't know.

27:42.745 --> 27:46.414
So I buried my head in the sand
and I took it and I settled!

27:46.832 --> 27:51.127
I settled for that shriek,
those dull vacant eyes,

27:51.211 --> 27:53.629
the boiled cabbage
stench of her.

27:53.714 --> 27:56.007
And why?
Because this is my life!

27:56.258 --> 27:58.676
This is the life I picked.

27:58.761 --> 28:01.012
And it's fine, but you
know what? It's not.

28:01.096 --> 28:04.349
I didn't pick this life.
This is not my frakking life.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.768
What the hell's
gotten into you?

28:06.852 --> 28:08.811
Don't do this.

28:08.896 --> 28:10.605
Don't do this
to her memory.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.190
You know what?

28:12.274 --> 28:14.859
I'm sorry if I'm not gonna do
this the way you want me to,

28:14.943 --> 28:16.861
or the way you might.

28:16.945 --> 28:20.490
But I will not make an angel out
of someone who wasn't an angel.

28:21.909 --> 28:23.701
But I can see you have.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.080
And now you've come down
here to be in my club,

28:27.164 --> 28:28.998
but you're not in my club.

28:29.083 --> 28:30.708
You don't know what
frakking club I'm in,

28:30.793 --> 28:33.336
'cause you never
asked the right questions.

28:33.796 --> 28:35.713
Chief, let's
get out of here.

28:35.798 --> 28:38.841
No. Why don't you go?

28:38.926 --> 28:40.134
Take care of your
precious ship.

28:40.219 --> 28:43.304
Stop it.
Stop all of this.

28:43.639 --> 28:45.390
'Cause if you don't, I'm
going to have to act on it.

28:45.474 --> 28:47.100
Now shut up.
Great!

28:47.184 --> 28:48.810
Do it! Please!

28:48.894 --> 28:51.229
For the love of Gods,
please demote me.

28:51.313 --> 28:53.856
Get me off
your frakking ship!

28:56.735 --> 28:58.945
Specialist Tyrol,

28:59.029 --> 29:03.908
I want you off my hangar deck
before you endanger another pilot.

29:03.992 --> 29:06.786
You're to report to
Petty Officer Bassom

29:06.870 --> 29:10.540
tomorrow morning
at 0600 for reassignment.

29:10.624 --> 29:12.291
Do you understand?

30:01.592 --> 30:03.426
Of course you have authority
over emergency measures,

30:03.510 --> 30:05.803
but you bulldozed this through
after the session was closed.

30:05.888 --> 30:07.305
Yes, exactly.

30:07.389 --> 30:09.432
It's a crowd control measure.

30:09.516 --> 30:12.310
I also authorized the repair
of a cargo elevator,

30:12.394 --> 30:13.769
or do you want to
talk about that, too?

30:13.854 --> 30:15.855
Crowd control? Looks to me
like it was pretty well designed

30:15.939 --> 30:18.316
purely to stop Gaius
Baltar's organization.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.942
You mean his cult?

30:20.194 --> 30:22.236
APOLLO: Well,
his "cult" was attacked.

30:22.321 --> 30:25.615
And from what I'm hearing around
the fleet, it was pretty brutal.

30:25.699 --> 30:27.992
It was brutal. Exactly.

30:28.076 --> 30:32.038
And this measure is designed
explicitly to protect those people.

30:32.122 --> 30:36.250
If they aren't gathering en masse,
they aren't provoking resentment.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.920
It limits his group, whilst
permitting more mainstream worship.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.172
ROSLIN: Wherever Gaius
Baltar is, violence happens.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.341
And if he doesn't
cause it, he draws it.

30:43.425 --> 30:48.179
My job, Mr. Adama,
is and always will be

30:48.263 --> 30:50.473
to keep the people safe.

30:51.600 --> 30:55.520
Madam President, I have to
wonder if this resolution

30:55.604 --> 30:58.397
couldn't be used against other
offshoot religious groups.

30:58.482 --> 31:01.192
Absolutely not. Gaius
Baltar is a special case.

31:01.276 --> 31:02.318
You know that.

31:02.402 --> 31:04.487
And we're making him
a special case.

31:04.571 --> 31:05.571
And how are we doing that?

31:05.656 --> 31:06.697
We're fueling his argument.

31:06.782 --> 31:08.115
I mean, after all,
is he preaching violence?

31:08.200 --> 31:09.408
Immoral acts?
I don't know.

31:09.493 --> 31:12.703
I haven't been to one of his...
What are they called? Services?

31:12.788 --> 31:16.958
It is not that far from what some
of our own Mithras followers believe.

31:17.042 --> 31:19.210
We have Mithrasaries
among the Gemenese.

31:19.294 --> 31:20.878
Can this order be
applied to them?

31:20.963 --> 31:24.006
Clear your heads. We are
talking about Gaius Baltar.

31:24.132 --> 31:28.719
Everyone in this room experienced
tragedy at New Caprica.

31:28.804 --> 31:30.388
Have we forgotten?

31:31.598 --> 31:33.724
Will you open this order

31:33.809 --> 31:35.059
to a full Quorum vote?

31:35.143 --> 31:36.435
No.

31:36.520 --> 31:39.897
We can override, Madam President.
I cannot let this stand.

31:41.149 --> 31:43.943
You can override, and you
cannot let this stand, Mr. Adama?

31:44.027 --> 31:46.028
Then you open it up to a vote.

31:46.113 --> 31:50.074
And if you strike this down, you
can all go back to your constituents,

31:50.158 --> 31:53.578
and you can tell them what you've done,
and "we, the people," will have triumphed.

31:53.662 --> 31:56.163
But think about
what it's gonna cost you.

31:57.457 --> 32:00.543
Because every single
one of you remember

32:00.627 --> 32:03.921
what it was like when Gaius
Baltar had political power.

32:04.006 --> 32:06.716
And you should be
terrified to think about

32:06.800 --> 32:10.761
what this man will do
with blind religious devotion.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.597
So go ahead.

32:13.807 --> 32:15.349
Vote.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.103
(PEOPLE MURMURING)

32:34.411 --> 32:36.996
Should I get used to
waking up to this face?

32:41.126 --> 32:42.918
You're traveling light.

32:43.587 --> 32:45.463
An informal chat.

32:46.048 --> 32:47.965
Just you and me.

32:48.050 --> 32:50.468
NO. 6: And the man watching
through the cameras.

32:51.053 --> 32:53.262
You haven't answered
my question.

32:54.139 --> 32:56.307
You want to know
how I work?

32:57.809 --> 32:59.769
If I can turn off pain?

33:00.103 --> 33:01.729
Can you?

33:02.522 --> 33:05.524
I want the pain.
It's how I learn.

33:08.153 --> 33:12.365
I was instrumental in the
destruction of humanity.

33:12.449 --> 33:15.076
But at the same time,
I learned because...

33:16.578 --> 33:18.454
Because I fell in love

33:19.414 --> 33:21.791
with a human man,

33:22.292 --> 33:24.293
and he was mortal

33:25.504 --> 33:27.922
and fallible

33:28.590 --> 33:31.926
and he had this incredible
pride in himself.

33:32.886 --> 33:35.596
He thought he knew
everything there was to know,

33:36.264 --> 33:39.433
and I loved him with
my whole heart.

33:41.770 --> 33:47.942
And then one day, I realized
I wouldn't have him forever.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.196
I understood what I'd done,

33:54.241 --> 33:57.284
how I betrayed him
and humanity.

33:59.287 --> 34:03.624
And that pain taught me
to understand death.

34:06.461 --> 34:08.421
(WHISPERING)
Baltar could die.

34:08.505 --> 34:09.547
And I loved him.

34:09.631 --> 34:10.715
No.

34:10.799 --> 34:13.300
Baltar's heart was ephemeral. No.

34:13.385 --> 34:16.137
Baltar's body was
fragile in my hands.

34:16.221 --> 34:20.558
No, we are not gonna talk about the
fragile body of Gaius frakking Baltar!

34:20.642 --> 34:21.976
Door!

34:22.227 --> 34:23.644
Door!

34:24.354 --> 34:25.813
Dismissed.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.440
Clear out, out!

34:28.483 --> 34:30.526
Frak, what's he gonna
do to her?

34:37.117 --> 34:39.160
I can tell you
how to turn it off.

34:39.244 --> 34:40.494
How?

34:40.579 --> 34:42.747
Pain is how I learn
from the guilt.

34:43.248 --> 34:47.877
There's wisdom there. Clarity.
You know yourself there.

34:47.961 --> 34:49.044
Pain.

34:49.129 --> 34:53.507
Our minds were designed
based on your minds.

34:54.134 --> 34:57.720
We learn things about how you
work that you've never known.

35:01.016 --> 35:06.228
When you're in pain, that's when
you learn who you really are.

35:08.523 --> 35:13.235
That's when you focus,
sharp as the point of a knife.

35:24.748 --> 35:26.999
I can give you
that clarity again.

35:30.545 --> 35:33.380
I'm sorry, sir, I'm not
supposed to let you enter.

35:33.465 --> 35:34.632
What's going on?
What are you doing?

35:34.716 --> 35:36.634
There are 12 people
inside already.

35:36.718 --> 35:38.302
You can count, can you?
Yes, sir.

35:38.386 --> 35:41.305
You can't enter without
breaking Emergency Provision 17.

35:41.389 --> 35:43.057
Okay, well, let me out. If
I leave, then he can come in.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.433
Yeah, if she leaves...
We're asking everyone

35:44.518 --> 35:45.810
to stay inside for safety.

35:45.894 --> 35:46.894
This is absurd.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.562
You're just counting heads.
I have my orders.

35:48.647 --> 35:49.939
Yeah, but I live here, okay?

35:50.023 --> 35:51.649
I live here, and so do
some of these women.

35:51.733 --> 35:53.567
Where are we supposed to go?

35:55.237 --> 35:56.987
NO. 6: This is
your moment, Gaius.

35:57.072 --> 35:59.198
Step forward.
Make a stand.

35:59.282 --> 36:00.825
(SIGHING)

36:00.909 --> 36:02.785
(SOFTLY) I don't
want to be a hero.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.286
I just want to go
to bed. Go to sleep.

36:04.371 --> 36:05.746
NO. 6: Look at me.

36:05.831 --> 36:09.500
I promise you. Step forward,
and you will not be hurt.

36:10.919 --> 36:12.586
Promise me?
NO. 6: Yes,

36:12.671 --> 36:15.047
you can lie down
inside. Go in.

36:18.218 --> 36:19.552
Stop, sir.

36:20.762 --> 36:22.263
PAULLA: (GASPING) Gaius!

36:23.765 --> 36:25.015
JEANNE: Are you all right?

36:33.108 --> 36:37.945
Get your damn hands off me,
you frakking freak machine!

36:51.293 --> 36:53.127
Can you feel it, Saul?

36:53.211 --> 36:55.296
Can you feel
the clarity of it?

36:56.006 --> 36:57.381
(EXHALES)

37:05.807 --> 37:08.058
GUARD: Stay down
or clear this area, sir!

37:08.143 --> 37:12.396
You have to do this. The
gain will outweigh the cost.

37:15.775 --> 37:17.151
(GROANING)

37:18.945 --> 37:20.154
WOMAN 1: No!

37:21.323 --> 37:22.698
(GROANING)

37:24.993 --> 37:26.911
BALTAR: I want to stay down.
I really want to stay down.

37:26.995 --> 37:28.495
NO. 6: No, you don't.

37:39.299 --> 37:40.549
Stay down, please, sir!

37:40.634 --> 37:42.468
Wait, wait, stop!

37:42.552 --> 37:43.928
Lieutenant.

37:44.012 --> 37:45.387
Stand down.

37:46.181 --> 37:48.933
The Quorum has just met
in an emergency session.

37:49.017 --> 37:51.518
Full right of assembly
has been restored.

37:53.229 --> 37:56.148
You can go back
into your home.

37:56.232 --> 37:57.733
No one will stop you.
WOMAN 2: Thank you.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.860
PAULLA: Gaius?
Come on.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.492
Thank you.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.661
I don't do these
things for you.

38:11.373 --> 38:14.124
You do them because
your God compels you.

38:16.503 --> 38:18.379
Okay. All right.

38:19.589 --> 38:21.298
Let's help him go in.

38:27.305 --> 38:30.891
Lee has no idea.
He really has no idea.

38:34.437 --> 38:35.980
Have you heard
anything I've said?

38:36.064 --> 38:40.651
There are pragmatic realities
he refuses to face.

38:42.362 --> 38:44.405
Well, that's a problem,
of course.

38:46.074 --> 38:48.409
He's doing what
he thinks is right.

38:48.493 --> 38:50.452
Well, yeah, he's Lee.

38:52.288 --> 38:55.165
Thing is, it probably
is the right thing,

38:56.334 --> 38:59.503
but sometimes the
right thing is a luxury.

38:59.587 --> 39:02.172
And it can have profoundly
dangerous consequences.

39:02.257 --> 39:06.343
And yet it's almost as if he
doesn't want that to be true.

39:07.595 --> 39:08.679
Okay, I got to stop this.

39:08.763 --> 39:13.225
I'm not supposed to
get upset during treatment.

39:14.602 --> 39:16.562
Will you read
the next chapter?

39:19.149 --> 39:22.484
I must warn you that I'm getting
into the part that I haven't read yet.

39:22.569 --> 39:23.944
Oh, dear.

39:24.404 --> 39:27.281
Are you going to be
able to continue?

39:36.916 --> 39:38.292
Chapter 7.

39:38.626 --> 39:42.463
"The raft was not as
seaworthy as I had hoped.

39:43.048 --> 39:46.050
"The waves repeatedly
threatened to swamp it.

39:46.134 --> 39:48.343
"I wasn't afraid to die.

39:50.680 --> 39:54.391
"I was afraid of the
emptiness that I felt inside.

39:58.646 --> 40:00.522
"I couldn't feel anything. "

40:02.609 --> 40:04.401
And that's what scared me.

40:06.154 --> 40:08.614
You came into my thoughts.

40:10.325 --> 40:11.950
You filled them.

40:14.537 --> 40:16.038
It felt good.

40:16.372 --> 40:17.998
More.

40:19.626 --> 40:21.001
No.

40:22.462 --> 40:24.046
Keep going.

40:24.672 --> 40:26.507
No, I made a mistake.

40:28.676 --> 40:30.385
This isn't what you need.

40:37.685 --> 40:39.228
BALTAR: I'm not a priest.

40:40.688 --> 40:43.732
I've never even been
a particularly good man.

40:45.193 --> 40:46.902
I have, in fact,

40:49.030 --> 40:52.616
been a profoundly
selfish man.

40:53.034 --> 40:55.119
But that doesn't
matter, you see.

40:56.371 --> 41:00.082
Something in the universe loves me.

41:05.046 --> 41:10.801
Something in the universe
loves the entity that is me.

41:12.470 --> 41:15.556
I will choose to call
this something, "God. "

41:16.099 --> 41:21.061
A singular spark that dwells in
the soul of every living being.

41:21.855 --> 41:25.649
If you look inside yourself,
you will find this spark, too.

41:26.776 --> 41:28.235
You will.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.156
But you have to look

41:33.408 --> 41:34.867
deep.

41:36.411 --> 41:38.287
Love your faults.

41:39.873 --> 41:41.623
Embrace them.

41:42.208 --> 41:46.587
If God embraces them,
then how can they be faults?

41:47.213 --> 41:49.006
Love yourself.

41:50.258 --> 41:52.342
You have to love yourself.

41:53.511 --> 41:58.765
If we don't love ourselves,
how can we love others?

42:02.228 --> 42:04.396
And when we know what we are,

42:04.480 --> 42:07.441
then we can find the
truth out about others,

42:08.276 --> 42:09.985
see what they are,

42:11.070 --> 42:12.779
the truth about them.

42:14.908 --> 42:16.992
And you know
what the truth is,

42:18.578 --> 42:20.495
the truth about them,

42:21.748 --> 42:23.290
about you,

42:23.958 --> 42:25.459
about me.

42:26.127 --> 42:27.544
Do you?

42:27.629 --> 42:29.254
(EXHALING)

42:33.343 --> 42:35.636
The truth is
we are all perfect

42:37.931 --> 42:39.389
just as we are.

42:39.474 --> 42:40.557
(WOMEN CRYING)

42:40.642 --> 42:44.186
God only loves that which
is perfect, and he loves you.

42:45.021 --> 42:47.648
He loves you because
you are perfect.

42:48.399 --> 42:52.402
You are perfect
just as you are.

42:52.487 --> 42:54.613
Yes!
