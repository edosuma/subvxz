00:14.166 --> 00:15.750
Hey! Over here.

00:16.875 --> 00:18.250
Hi.

00:18.291 --> 00:20.125
This is my locker, number 67.

00:20.166 --> 00:21.875
Congratulations.

00:22.834 --> 00:24.083
Open it.

00:28.041 --> 00:31.000
- You sure you want to do this?

00:28.041 --> 00:31.000
- Oh yeah, I'm sure.

00:34.250 --> 00:35.583
- Well?

00:34.250 --> 00:35.583
- He's doing it.

00:35.625 --> 00:37.917
Oh, my god. Are we crazy?

00:35.625 --> 00:37.917
Is this crazy?

00:37.959 --> 00:42.291
I don't know.

00:37.959 --> 00:42.291
It's a little crazy,

00:37.959 --> 00:42.291
but it feels good.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.583
But, hey,

00:42.333 --> 00:44.583
if you're not sure,

00:44.625 --> 00:46.250
You can still think about it.

00:44.625 --> 00:46.250
We could do it tomorrow.

00:46.291 --> 00:49.375
No, tomorrow I'm getting

00:46.291 --> 00:49.375
laser eye surgery.

00:49.417 --> 00:53.875
Oh. Yeah. Right.

00:49.417 --> 00:53.875
Vision.

00:53.917 --> 00:55.750
Yeah. And I don't need

00:53.917 --> 00:55.750
to think about it.

00:55.792 --> 00:58.250
- Let's do this.

00:55.792 --> 00:58.250
- Yeah, all right.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.583
Henry! Henry.

01:00.625 --> 01:02.959
- Oh, hey, Shar.

01:00.625 --> 01:02.959
- Hi. Hey, Bianca.

01:03.041 --> 01:04.291
Hi.

01:04.333 --> 01:07.375
We were just going

01:04.333 --> 01:07.375
to discu... Okay.

01:07.417 --> 01:10.500
- Is it true?

01:07.417 --> 01:10.500
- That they found Bigfoot

01:07.417 --> 01:10.500
on the moon?

01:11.542 --> 01:12.583
You know

01:11.542 --> 01:12.583
what I want to know.

01:12.625 --> 01:14.041
Yeah, it's true.

01:14.083 --> 01:15.667
I'm letting Bianca

01:14.083 --> 01:15.667
share my locker.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.583
(gasps)

01:17.625 --> 01:19.792
Because, you know,

01:17.625 --> 01:19.792
her locker's upstairs,

01:19.834 --> 01:23.458
but most of her classes

01:19.834 --> 01:23.458
are down here, so we figured

01:23.500 --> 01:25.333
she might as well keep

01:23.500 --> 01:25.333
some of her stuff in my locker.

01:25.375 --> 01:28.291
And because you two

01:25.375 --> 01:28.291
like each other.

01:28.333 --> 01:30.583
- She liked me first.

01:28.333 --> 01:30.583
- Uh-huh.

01:30.625 --> 01:32.750
Son, it's time.

01:32.792 --> 01:35.250
Cool. Bianca!

01:35.291 --> 01:36.625
Let's do this!

01:40.250 --> 01:42.875
Now, kids, sharing a locker

01:40.250 --> 01:42.875
is a big deal.

01:42.917 --> 01:44.417
- Right.

01:42.917 --> 01:44.417
- We know.

01:44.458 --> 01:47.125
Okay.

01:47.166 --> 01:49.792
Girl, you want

01:47.166 --> 01:49.792
to put your thumb on the pad?

01:51.125 --> 01:52.417
I do.

01:53.125 --> 01:55.250
(beeping)

01:55.291 --> 01:56.917
Okay. You're all set.

01:59.125 --> 02:03.458
Now, remember kids,

01:59.125 --> 02:03.458
life is one long disappointment.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.291
Well, try it.

02:08.333 --> 02:10.333
(chatter)

02:10.375 --> 02:13.166
(beeping)

02:13.208 --> 02:16.250
♪

02:16.291 --> 02:19.125
Now, stomp on this bag

02:16.291 --> 02:19.125
of Skeezits.

02:21.417 --> 02:23.458
Muscle toe.

02:28.542 --> 02:30.959
Henry!

02:31.000 --> 02:33.667
Henry!

02:35.166 --> 02:37.417
- Henry.

02:35.166 --> 02:37.417
- Oh, hey, man. What's up?

02:37.458 --> 02:40.041
I just heard you're letting

02:37.458 --> 02:40.041
Bianca share your locker.

02:40.083 --> 02:41.667
- Yeah, I am.

02:40.083 --> 02:41.667
- He is.

02:41.709 --> 02:43.667
- We are.

02:41.709 --> 02:43.667
- We is.

02:43.709 --> 02:46.291
Don't get cute.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.792
When I asked you

02:46.333 --> 02:48.792
if I could share your locker,

02:48.834 --> 02:50.250
you told me

02:48.834 --> 02:50.250
you weren't ready.

02:50.291 --> 02:54.166
I know.

02:50.291 --> 02:54.166
But Bianca's a girl.

02:54.208 --> 02:57.709
Well, that's not my fault.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.000
Sorry, man.

03:01.375 --> 03:04.625
Hey. I know how to make

03:01.375 --> 03:04.625
a Jasper feel better.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.750
- How?

03:04.667 --> 03:06.750
- Free Skeezits.

03:06.792 --> 03:09.000
- Really?

03:06.792 --> 03:09.000
- Mm-hmm.

03:10.125 --> 03:13.291
Wow. Pre-crushed.

03:17.291 --> 03:18.458
It all just

03:17.291 --> 03:18.458
kind of happened.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.375
My dad was

03:18.500 --> 03:21.375
an irresponsible scientist.

03:21.417 --> 03:23.250
I wanted an after-school job.

03:23.291 --> 03:26.458
And by accident,

03:23.291 --> 03:26.458
he made me indestructible.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.125
Ah!

03:28.166 --> 03:31.166
I went into this crazy store

03:28.166 --> 03:31.166
and met a pretty

03:28.166 --> 03:31.166
interesting guy.

03:31.208 --> 03:33.166
I'm going to blow your mind.

03:33.208 --> 03:35.792
Now I protect

03:33.208 --> 03:35.792
the good citizens of Swellview

03:35.834 --> 03:37.792
- who call me...

03:35.834 --> 03:37.792
- He turned out to be...

03:37.834 --> 03:40.041
- You know the name.

03:37.834 --> 03:40.041
- Captain Man!

03:40.083 --> 03:41.250
That's right, Henry.

03:41.291 --> 03:43.709
In time, I realized

03:41.291 --> 03:43.709
that being a superhero

03:43.750 --> 03:45.125
is a lot to handle alone.

03:45.166 --> 03:47.834
- He wanted some help.

03:45.166 --> 03:47.834
- I needed a sidekick.

03:47.875 --> 03:49.208
I, Henry Hart...

03:49.250 --> 03:50.917
pledge to never ever ever

03:49.250 --> 03:50.917
tell anyone...

03:50.959 --> 03:52.458
that I'm Captain Man's

03:50.959 --> 03:52.458
secret sidekick.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.041
- It is done.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.041
- Now we blow bubbles.

03:55.083 --> 03:55.917
And fight crime.

03:55.959 --> 03:57.709
Feels good.

04:11.709 --> 04:14.959
- Call it.

04:11.709 --> 04:14.959
- Up the tube!

04:15.000 --> 04:16.375
Oh, my boot.

04:16.417 --> 04:18.125
Ha!

04:29.041 --> 04:30.375
Yeah. Yeah.

04:30.417 --> 04:32.166
Yes, I understand.

04:30.417 --> 04:32.166
Has anyone been hurt?

04:32.208 --> 04:35.625
Wait, has anyone

04:32.208 --> 04:35.625
called the fire department?

04:35.667 --> 04:37.667
What do you mean

04:35.667 --> 04:37.667
they're at a softball game?

04:37.709 --> 04:38.834
All of them?

04:38.875 --> 04:40.041
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:38.875 --> 04:40.041
I'm on my way.

04:40.083 --> 04:41.250
But go ahead

04:40.083 --> 04:41.250
and call the police.

04:41.291 --> 04:43.375
Tell them to bring

04:41.291 --> 04:43.375
a tranquilizer gun.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.083
What do you mean the police

04:43.417 --> 04:46.083
are all playing softball?

04:46.125 --> 04:49.667
Oh, they're playing

04:46.125 --> 04:49.667
the fire department.

04:49.709 --> 04:52.500
What? Okay, just tell me

04:49.709 --> 04:52.500
what floor it's stuck on.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.959
(screaming)

04:54.000 --> 04:54.959
(thud)

04:55.000 --> 04:56.667
(elevator dings)

04:58.208 --> 05:01.208
- Hey, I'm here.

04:58.208 --> 05:01.208
- We have two emergencies.

05:01.250 --> 05:03.125
Whoa.

05:01.250 --> 05:03.125
What's going on?

05:03.166 --> 05:05.291
There's a vicious

05:03.166 --> 05:05.291
alligator running wild

05:03.166 --> 05:05.291
through Swellview Park.

05:05.333 --> 05:07.834
What's a vicious alligator

05:05.333 --> 05:07.834
doing in Swellview Park?

05:07.875 --> 05:10.125
Running wild.

05:10.166 --> 05:14.041
And somebody's stuck

05:10.166 --> 05:14.041
in an elevator on the 79th floor

05:10.166 --> 05:14.041
of the Nakatomi Tower.

05:14.083 --> 05:16.333
Ooh, yikes.

05:14.083 --> 05:16.333
What are we going to do?

05:16.375 --> 05:20.750
I'll go rescue the person

05:16.375 --> 05:20.750
from the stuck elevator.

05:16.375 --> 05:20.750
You go get that alligator.

05:20.792 --> 05:23.208
No, no, no.

05:20.792 --> 05:23.208
No way, Ray.

05:23.250 --> 05:25.417
You can't make Henry go get

05:23.250 --> 05:25.417
a wild alligator by himself.

05:25.458 --> 05:28.792
All right, fine.

05:25.458 --> 05:28.792
We'll flip for it.

05:25.458 --> 05:28.792
I call heads.

05:31.542 --> 05:32.959
I'm taking that quarter

05:31.542 --> 05:32.959
out of your paycheck.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.917
Dude, you're indestructible.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.917
You go get the alligator.

05:35.959 --> 05:38.083
Okay, fine.

05:38.125 --> 05:39.917
I'll get the elevator,

05:38.125 --> 05:39.917
you get the alligator.

05:39.959 --> 05:41.458
Good. Wait.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.000
(chuckles)

05:41.500 --> 05:44.000
You almost fell for it.

05:44.041 --> 05:45.917
That alligator

05:44.041 --> 05:45.917
would have killed you.

05:46.834 --> 05:48.458
Guys, go rescue people.

05:48.500 --> 05:49.875
Right.

05:49.917 --> 05:51.875
Let's chew, then do.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.959
Nice one.

06:08.291 --> 06:09.583
(both) Up the tube!

06:12.208 --> 06:14.709
Well, I'm going to watch

06:12.208 --> 06:14.709
"Dogs Got Talent."

06:18.083 --> 06:20.750
<i>Oh, look at Lolly jump.</i>

06:23.083 --> 06:25.208
<i>Go, Lolly.</i>

06:28.959 --> 06:31.625
<i>(girl) Help!</i>

06:28.959 --> 06:31.625
<i>Please help me!</i>

06:33.417 --> 06:35.959
Hello?

06:33.417 --> 06:35.959
Can anyone hear me?

06:36.000 --> 06:39.625
- Just hang on.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.625
Help is on the way.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.000
- Please hurry!

06:41.041 --> 06:42.667
Yeah, yeah.

06:42.709 --> 06:44.583
I should've gone

06:42.709 --> 06:44.583
for the alligator.

06:44.625 --> 06:47.458
- (screams)

06:44.625 --> 06:47.458
What's happening?

06:47.500 --> 06:49.375
Relax, I'm going

06:47.500 --> 06:49.375
to get you out of there.

06:49.417 --> 06:51.250
- Who are you?

06:49.417 --> 06:51.250
- Kid Danger.

06:51.291 --> 06:53.250
Oh my god,

06:51.291 --> 06:53.250
is Captain Man with you?

06:53.291 --> 06:55.375
No, just me.

06:55.417 --> 06:57.041
Oh.

06:58.125 --> 07:01.834
Well, don't act so excited.

07:01.875 --> 07:03.750
(girl) Please hurry!

07:07.041 --> 07:08.750
Please get me

07:07.041 --> 07:08.750
out of this elevator.

07:08.792 --> 07:11.208
I just had laser eye surgery

07:08.792 --> 07:11.208
and I can barely see.

07:11.250 --> 07:15.250
Okay. Stop whining and move

07:11.250 --> 07:15.250
to the side. I'm going

07:11.250 --> 07:15.250
to drop down next to you.

07:15.291 --> 07:16.417
Okay.

07:18.625 --> 07:19.959
(screams)

07:20.000 --> 07:21.125
It's okay. It's okay.

07:21.166 --> 07:22.250
It's...

07:22.291 --> 07:23.542
You.

07:23.583 --> 07:25.375
Kid Danger?

07:25.417 --> 07:27.000
Uh...

07:28.208 --> 07:29.500
Yeah. Yeah.

07:29.542 --> 07:32.917
(lowers voice)

07:29.542 --> 07:32.917
Uh... I mean, yes, it is.

07:32.959 --> 07:34.166
I am me.

07:34.208 --> 07:35.875
Oh, good.

07:35.917 --> 07:39.250
- So, you just had

07:35.917 --> 07:39.250
laser eye surgery?

07:35.917 --> 07:39.250
- Uh-huh.

07:39.291 --> 07:41.208
Can you see

07:39.291 --> 07:41.208
this waving motion?

07:42.583 --> 07:43.834
A little bit.

07:43.875 --> 07:45.166
(cable creaking)

07:45.208 --> 07:46.583
(screaming)

07:46.625 --> 07:47.875
Oh.

07:47.917 --> 07:49.750
Oh, we got to get

07:47.917 --> 07:49.750
out of here. Maybe we can--

07:49.792 --> 07:52.125
(man) Hey, can you hear me

07:49.792 --> 07:52.125
in there?

07:52.166 --> 07:54.709
- Yes!

07:52.166 --> 07:54.709
- Yeah, we can hear you!

07:54.750 --> 07:56.333
My name is Robert Kirby,

07:56.375 --> 07:58.041
I'm the building manager!

07:58.083 --> 08:01.000
(both) Hi, Robert!

08:01.041 --> 08:02.417
Who's that in there?

08:02.458 --> 08:03.583
It's Kid Danger!

08:03.625 --> 08:06.458
Really? Is Captain Man

08:03.625 --> 08:06.458
in there with you?

08:06.500 --> 08:09.542
- No!

08:06.500 --> 08:09.542
- Oh.

08:09.583 --> 08:11.667
(screaming)

08:11.709 --> 08:14.083
- Hey, Kid Danger?

08:11.709 --> 08:14.083
- Yeah?

08:14.125 --> 08:16.208
Can I get a selfie with you?

08:16.250 --> 08:19.208
Let's talk

08:16.250 --> 08:19.208
about that later, Robert!

08:19.250 --> 08:21.208
Okay, don't forget!

08:22.667 --> 08:25.625
Oh, man,

08:22.667 --> 08:25.625
the cable's going to snap.

08:27.792 --> 08:29.917
What happened?

08:29.959 --> 08:34.792
Uh, the elevator

08:29.959 --> 08:34.792
kind of... left.

08:34.834 --> 08:36.667
What?!

08:34.834 --> 08:36.667
Where'd it go?

08:36.709 --> 08:40.041
(crashing)

08:40.083 --> 08:42.917
- About 79 stories down there.

08:40.083 --> 08:42.917
- Oh my god!

08:42.959 --> 08:45.625
Don't worry. I got you.

08:47.417 --> 08:48.667
You ready to go

08:47.417 --> 08:48.667
up to the roof?

08:49.792 --> 08:52.625
Yeah. In just...

08:52.667 --> 08:54.333
Just a sec...

08:55.792 --> 08:57.917
Okay, but...

08:57.959 --> 09:00.625
We should hurry.

09:10.041 --> 09:11.250
(man) Hey, Kid Danger!

09:11.291 --> 09:13.375
When can I get that selfie

09:11.291 --> 09:13.375
with you?

09:13.417 --> 09:16.291
Not now, Robert!

09:16.333 --> 09:17.792
- Hold tight.

09:16.333 --> 09:17.792
- Okay.

09:17.834 --> 09:19.709
Up the shaft!

09:19.750 --> 09:21.583
(screams)

09:21.625 --> 09:26.083
♪

09:26.125 --> 09:29.333
So, I look up, and I see

09:26.125 --> 09:29.333
the cable is about to snap,

09:26.125 --> 09:29.333
and I yell,

09:29.375 --> 09:30.583
"Oh, man,

09:29.375 --> 09:30.583
it's going to snap!"

09:30.625 --> 09:32.834
- And then it snapped?

09:30.625 --> 09:32.834
- And then it snapped.

09:32.875 --> 09:34.125
Whoa.

09:34.166 --> 09:36.750
Yeah. And then, whoosh,

09:34.166 --> 09:36.750
the elevator just drops,

09:36.792 --> 09:39.083
like, bye bye elevator,

09:36.792 --> 09:39.083
and I'm just hanging.

09:39.125 --> 09:40.875
- So, what about Bianca?

09:39.125 --> 09:40.875
- She was holding onto me.

09:40.917 --> 09:43.583
- Tight?

09:40.917 --> 09:43.583
- Tight.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.500
And then... we kissed.

09:45.542 --> 09:47.792
Ooh.

09:49.333 --> 09:51.291
Woo.

09:51.333 --> 09:53.417
Wait.

09:51.333 --> 09:53.417
You two kissed?

09:53.458 --> 09:54.667
While dangling.

09:54.709 --> 09:57.041
- Oh, a dangle kiss, wow!

09:54.709 --> 09:57.041
- Wow.

09:57.083 --> 09:58.875
And you're not mad?

09:58.917 --> 10:01.917
Pfft. Mad happy.

10:01.959 --> 10:05.500
Why should Henry be mad that

10:01.959 --> 10:05.500
The girl he likes kissed him?

10:05.542 --> 10:07.625
Because she didn't

10:05.542 --> 10:07.625
kiss Henry,

10:07.667 --> 10:09.166
she kissed Kid Danger.

10:09.208 --> 10:13.583
Yeah, and I'm Kid Danger.

10:13.625 --> 10:17.417
(Both) Dur.

10:17.458 --> 10:18.542
Guys!

10:18.583 --> 10:21.583
We all know

10:18.583 --> 10:21.583
that Henry is Kid Danger.

10:21.625 --> 10:23.667
Bianca doesn't.

10:25.792 --> 10:30.125
Well, yeah, but she...

10:31.583 --> 10:34.375
Oh my god, she's right.

10:34.417 --> 10:36.291
Dur.

10:37.583 --> 10:38.750
Bianca cheated on me.

10:38.792 --> 10:40.542
Oh, come on,

10:38.792 --> 10:40.542
she didn't really cheat.

10:40.583 --> 10:41.750
She did, too.

10:41.792 --> 10:44.208
She kissed another guy

10:41.792 --> 10:44.208
who I admit was me,

10:44.250 --> 10:47.583
but she didn't know that.

10:44.250 --> 10:47.583
So she cheated.

10:47.625 --> 10:50.166
Yep. This steak is good.

10:47.625 --> 10:50.166
Can I have another one?

10:50.208 --> 10:51.792
Yeah, but that's not steak.

10:51.834 --> 10:53.542
Oh. What is it?

10:54.709 --> 10:56.166
Alligator.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.125
(text alert)

11:09.959 --> 11:11.667
Jasper is going to be here

11:09.959 --> 11:11.667
in ten minutes.

11:11.709 --> 11:13.083
Great.

11:13.125 --> 11:16.500
Yay. Wee.

11:16.542 --> 11:19.000
Um, what time's Bianca

11:16.542 --> 11:19.000
supposed to get here?

11:19.041 --> 11:21.125
I don't know.

11:21.166 --> 11:25.583
I guess it depends on whether

11:21.166 --> 11:25.583
or not she stops along the way

11:21.166 --> 11:25.583
to kiss 20 more guys!

11:25.625 --> 11:28.583
Okay, dude,

11:25.625 --> 11:28.583
you're a little out of control.

11:28.625 --> 11:31.458
No, I'm in complete control.

11:33.625 --> 11:37.250
(grunting)

11:50.417 --> 11:52.291
How are we all going

11:50.417 --> 11:52.291
to play a game tonight

11:52.333 --> 11:53.750
if you're this mad

11:52.333 --> 11:53.750
at Bianca?

11:53.792 --> 11:55.041
I'm not mad.

11:55.083 --> 11:57.625
- Yes you are.

11:55.083 --> 11:57.625
- Dang right I'm mad!

11:57.667 --> 12:00.291
And it's Bianca's fault

11:57.667 --> 12:00.291
because she never should've

11:57.667 --> 12:00.291
kissed Kid Danger.

12:00.333 --> 12:01.583
We should cancel game night.

12:01.625 --> 12:02.792
We're not canceling

12:01.625 --> 12:02.792
game night.

12:02.834 --> 12:04.250
You're too mad

12:02.834 --> 12:04.250
to play a game.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.500
I'm very good

12:04.291 --> 12:06.500
at hiding my anger!

12:06.542 --> 12:08.709
See me smile?

12:12.959 --> 12:14.333
Dah.

12:18.792 --> 12:19.917
Okay, Jasper.

12:19.959 --> 12:22.333
Name the famous celebrity

12:19.959 --> 12:22.333
from the 1960s

12:22.375 --> 12:25.166
who was also the third man

12:22.375 --> 12:25.166
to walk on the moon.

12:25.208 --> 12:27.667
Uh... Sammy Davis Junior.

12:27.709 --> 12:29.041
Correct.

12:29.083 --> 12:33.542
(bells dinging)

12:34.583 --> 12:36.250
Okay, your turn, Henry.

12:36.291 --> 12:39.083
Yeah.

12:36.291 --> 12:39.083
My turn.

12:41.542 --> 12:43.166
He got an eight.

12:43.208 --> 12:45.917
(all) Wazzle.

12:49.583 --> 12:51.709
All right, Bianca.

12:51.750 --> 12:54.125
Name Taylor Swift's

12:51.750 --> 12:54.125
second hit song

12:54.166 --> 12:56.458
and the most popular dessert

12:54.166 --> 12:56.458
in Wisconsin.

12:56.500 --> 12:59.125
Um...

12:59.166 --> 13:04.458
Hey, if you're not sure,

12:59.166 --> 13:04.458
why don't you just cheat?

13:04.500 --> 13:06.667
Are you mad at me

13:04.500 --> 13:06.667
about something?

13:06.709 --> 13:09.291
I don't know, should I be?

13:09.333 --> 13:11.208
I'm just trying

13:09.333 --> 13:11.208
to play the game.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.917
Well, I'm trying

13:11.250 --> 13:13.917
to play the game of life...

13:13.959 --> 13:15.250
the right way!

13:19.125 --> 13:22.917
Uh...

13:19.125 --> 13:22.917
I'm starting a worm farm.

13:25.542 --> 13:27.917
Excuse me,

13:25.542 --> 13:27.917
where's the bathroom?

13:27.959 --> 13:31.208
Why? Need to wash

13:27.959 --> 13:31.208
your dirty hands?

13:31.250 --> 13:33.750
Uh, it's back through there

13:31.250 --> 13:33.750
down the hall.

13:33.792 --> 13:35.250
Thanks.

13:35.959 --> 13:37.125
(doorbell rings)

13:37.166 --> 13:39.500
Piper, go see

13:37.166 --> 13:39.500
who's at the door.

13:39.542 --> 13:40.792
Dang it.

13:42.041 --> 13:43.208
I'll go see

13:42.041 --> 13:43.208
who's at the door

13:43.250 --> 13:45.667
because I want to go see

13:43.250 --> 13:45.667
who's at the door,

13:45.709 --> 13:47.917
not because you told me to.

13:50.875 --> 13:52.417
Hi.

14:02.250 --> 14:03.792
Hi.

14:03.834 --> 14:06.166
Hey, Oliver,

14:03.834 --> 14:06.166
what are you doing here?

14:06.208 --> 14:08.000
I heard you were

14:06.208 --> 14:08.000
playing a game.

14:08.041 --> 14:10.250
We are.

14:08.041 --> 14:10.250
Did someone invite you?

14:10.291 --> 14:11.166
No.

14:11.208 --> 14:13.875
Come on in, Neesha!

14:21.917 --> 14:24.750
Um... who's that?

14:24.792 --> 14:26.500
My great grandma.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.875
I'm ready to play.

14:29.917 --> 14:32.375
Hey, Piper, will you come

14:29.917 --> 14:32.375
be Oliver's game partner?

14:32.417 --> 14:33.917
Yeah, whatever.

14:36.875 --> 14:39.542
Hey, I love that blue soap

14:36.875 --> 14:39.542
in your bathroom.

14:39.583 --> 14:42.333
You probably love the soap

14:39.583 --> 14:42.333
in all guys' bathrooms.

14:43.959 --> 14:45.250
Who's that chick?

14:45.291 --> 14:46.792
- She's Bianca.

14:45.291 --> 14:46.792
- Hi.

14:46.834 --> 14:50.083
The Bianca that got rescued

14:46.834 --> 14:50.083
by Kid Danger yesterday?

14:50.125 --> 14:52.333
- Uh-huh.

14:50.125 --> 14:52.333
- Oh my god.

14:52.375 --> 14:54.333
I heard on the news

14:52.375 --> 14:54.333
that you and Kid Danger

14:54.375 --> 14:56.792
were dangling by a rope

14:54.375 --> 14:56.792
in an elevator shaft.

14:56.834 --> 14:59.333
Yeah. I'd just gotten laser

14:56.834 --> 14:59.333
surgery on my eyes and--

14:59.375 --> 15:01.792
Yeah, blah, blah.

14:59.375 --> 15:01.792
Tell me about Kid Danger.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.917
- Yeah, tell me

15:01.834 --> 15:03.917
about Kid Danger.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.917
- Tell us.

15:03.959 --> 15:07.041
Okay, well, I was in the

15:03.959 --> 15:07.041
elevator and it got stuck.

15:07.083 --> 15:08.083
Yeah, and?

15:08.125 --> 15:10.125
And Kid Danger showed up.

15:10.166 --> 15:12.542
Yeah, and?

15:12.583 --> 15:15.083
And the elevator fell,

15:12.583 --> 15:15.083
but Kid Danger saved me.

15:15.125 --> 15:18.291
Yeah, and?

15:18.333 --> 15:20.583
And then he got us

15:18.333 --> 15:20.583
up on the roof,

15:20.625 --> 15:23.375
a helicopter picked us up.

15:20.625 --> 15:23.375
And that was it.

15:23.417 --> 15:26.041
You sure

15:23.417 --> 15:26.041
you're not leaving anything out?

15:26.083 --> 15:27.959
What's wrong with you?

15:28.000 --> 15:31.500
Oh, I don't know. Maybe someone

15:28.000 --> 15:31.500
kicked me in the heart.

15:37.500 --> 15:38.709
I got a seven.

15:38.750 --> 15:41.583
(all) Wazzle.

15:41.625 --> 15:42.542
You didn't say wazzle.

15:42.583 --> 15:44.375
Maybe I don't want

15:42.583 --> 15:44.375
to say wazzle.

15:45.667 --> 15:47.834
Fair enough.

15:47.875 --> 15:51.417
And maybe I don't want to be

15:47.875 --> 15:51.417
Bianca's game partner anymore.

15:54.250 --> 15:58.500
Sorry, guys,

15:54.250 --> 15:58.500
but I'm going to go.

16:04.792 --> 16:07.250
Wazzle.

16:13.583 --> 16:15.834
Will you please tell Henry

16:13.583 --> 16:15.834
he's overreacting?

16:15.875 --> 16:17.583
You're overreacting.

16:19.375 --> 16:21.083
No, I'm not.

16:19.375 --> 16:21.083
And guess what?

16:21.125 --> 16:22.875
What?

16:22.917 --> 16:24.792
When I get to school tomorrow,

16:22.917 --> 16:24.792
I'm going to have

16:22.917 --> 16:24.792
the maintenance guy

16:24.834 --> 16:27.709
Come to my locker

16:24.834 --> 16:27.709
and de-activate Bianca's

16:24.834 --> 16:27.709
thumb print.

16:27.750 --> 16:30.208
But you just started

16:27.750 --> 16:30.208
sharing your locker with her.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.667
I knew it wouldn't last.

16:32.709 --> 16:35.625
- So, Henry,

16:32.709 --> 16:35.625
you really liked Bianca?

16:32.709 --> 16:35.625
- I did.

16:35.667 --> 16:37.417
And now you think

16:35.667 --> 16:37.417
she's a bad person

16:37.458 --> 16:40.333
because she kissed Kid Danger.

16:37.458 --> 16:40.333
(squeals)

16:41.709 --> 16:42.834
Which is you.

16:42.875 --> 16:44.959
She didn't know it was me.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.625
You know,

16:45.000 --> 16:48.625
I bet you she'd dump me

16:45.000 --> 16:48.625
for Kid Danger in a second.

16:48.667 --> 16:51.000
Well, if you're

16:48.667 --> 16:51.000
so sure of that,

16:48.667 --> 16:51.000
why don't you find out?

16:51.041 --> 16:52.875
Huh?

16:52.917 --> 16:54.125
Find out how?

16:54.166 --> 16:55.709
Rescue her again.

16:55.750 --> 16:57.291
Exactly.

16:57.333 --> 16:59.917
Yeah, and then

16:57.333 --> 16:59.917
after you rescue her,

16:59.959 --> 17:02.875
See if you can really get her

16:59.959 --> 17:02.875
to fall in love with Kid Danger.

17:02.917 --> 17:05.375
And what am I supposed

17:02.917 --> 17:05.375
to rescue her from?

17:06.291 --> 17:09.291
Two teenage thugs.

17:09.333 --> 17:12.834
Yeah. Bad teenage boys. Eh?

17:12.875 --> 17:13.875
Eh?

17:13.917 --> 17:17.542
(chuckling)

17:18.709 --> 17:21.125
(sighing)

17:38.125 --> 17:40.291
Okay, you guys

17:38.125 --> 17:40.291
look so stupid.

17:40.333 --> 17:42.542
No we don't.

17:44.458 --> 17:46.500
We look just like

17:44.458 --> 17:46.500
typical rotten teenagers.

17:46.542 --> 17:48.291
Yeah, we're bad news teens.

17:48.333 --> 17:50.375
Yeah, we don't care

17:48.333 --> 17:50.375
about no rules.

17:50.417 --> 17:52.208
Get out of my room, Mom.

17:50.417 --> 17:52.208
I hate you. Gah.

17:52.250 --> 17:54.375
(grunting)

17:54.417 --> 17:56.500
Okay, Bianca's on her way.

17:59.542 --> 18:02.500
- You know what to do?

17:59.542 --> 18:02.500
- Yeah, yeah. Just go, go, go.

18:02.542 --> 18:04.083
All right. All right.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.458
- All right.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.458
- (grunts)

18:10.333 --> 18:11.875
Hey, hey, hey.

18:11.917 --> 18:13.083
Where you going?

18:13.125 --> 18:14.333
Yeah, where you going?

18:14.375 --> 18:16.959
To talk to a teacher.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.875
Oh, I don't think so.

18:18.917 --> 18:20.166
We don't think so.

18:20.208 --> 18:21.542
Yeah, no, no, no.

18:21.583 --> 18:23.458
- That ain't happening.

18:21.583 --> 18:23.458
- Nuh-uh.

18:23.500 --> 18:26.917
- You going nowhere, girl.

18:23.500 --> 18:26.917
- That's right!

18:26.959 --> 18:28.333
Who are you guys?

18:28.375 --> 18:32.458
(both) oh.

18:34.667 --> 18:36.417
- Hey, give me my phone!

18:34.667 --> 18:36.417
- No.

18:36.458 --> 18:37.667
We're not going to.

18:37.709 --> 18:41.875
We're going to delete

18:37.709 --> 18:41.875
some of your contacts.

18:41.917 --> 18:43.709
And then I'm going

18:41.917 --> 18:43.709
to punch your dad.

18:43.750 --> 18:44.792
What?

18:44.834 --> 18:46.291
♪

18:46.333 --> 18:48.542
Hey!

18:46.333 --> 18:48.542
Leave her alone!

18:49.875 --> 18:51.166
Kid Danger!

18:52.834 --> 18:56.041
Don't get nervous.

18:52.834 --> 18:56.041
It's two against one.

18:56.083 --> 18:57.792
Yeah.

18:57.834 --> 19:01.375
You sure you want to mess with

18:57.834 --> 19:01.375
two tough teenagers like us?

19:01.417 --> 19:02.750
Because if you do,

19:01.417 --> 19:02.750
we're going to--

19:02.792 --> 19:04.709
(zapping)

19:07.917 --> 19:10.041
(grunting)

19:10.083 --> 19:12.208
Whoa. Ugh. Ugh.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.208
All right.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.208
Okay. All right.

19:14.250 --> 19:15.917
All right, that's enough!

19:17.250 --> 19:18.458
Then get out of here!

19:18.500 --> 19:20.333
And drag your friend with you.

19:20.375 --> 19:22.500
Okay, okay.

19:22.834 --> 19:24.709
(gasps)

19:28.375 --> 19:30.083
Yeah, you better exit!

19:30.125 --> 19:31.750
(Captain Man) Okay.

19:33.750 --> 19:35.291
I think this phone

19:33.750 --> 19:35.291
belongs to you.

19:35.333 --> 19:38.542
Thanks.

19:35.333 --> 19:38.542
That was amazing.

19:38.583 --> 19:42.375
Ah, I don't sweat guys

19:38.583 --> 19:42.375
like that.

19:42.417 --> 19:47.375
No, I mean,

19:42.417 --> 19:47.375
that's the second time

19:42.417 --> 19:47.375
this week you've rescued me.

19:47.417 --> 19:50.583
Maybe you'd like

19:47.417 --> 19:50.583
to thank me for that.

19:56.166 --> 19:57.625
You don't want to kiss me?

19:57.667 --> 19:59.458
No.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.375
We kissed before.

20:01.417 --> 20:05.667
Yeah, but that was a mistake.

20:05.709 --> 20:08.875
Look, I really appreciate you

20:05.709 --> 20:08.875
rescuing me.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.333
But...

20:10.375 --> 20:13.417
I like somebody else.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.750
Oh.

20:15.792 --> 20:18.333
But I'm

20:15.792 --> 20:18.333
a superhero's sidekick.

20:18.375 --> 20:22.959
I know. And you're really

20:18.375 --> 20:22.959
nice and awesome and

20:18.375 --> 20:22.959
everything, but--

20:23.000 --> 20:25.333
Hey, I get it.

20:25.375 --> 20:27.667
Thanks for understanding.

20:27.709 --> 20:29.500
Sure.

20:32.375 --> 20:35.500
So, this other guy you like,

20:35.542 --> 20:37.667
I guess

20:35.542 --> 20:37.667
he's pretty good looking.

20:39.083 --> 20:41.166
Yeah, he's really cute.

20:41.208 --> 20:43.041
- And funny.

20:41.208 --> 20:43.041
- Uh-huh.

20:43.083 --> 20:45.583
- Super smart.

20:43.083 --> 20:45.583
- Eh.

20:47.458 --> 20:49.291
He's smart enough.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.208
Oh my gosh, look!

20:52.250 --> 20:54.959
Kid Danger,

20:52.250 --> 20:54.959
right here in our school!

20:55.000 --> 20:56.458
Yes.

20:56.500 --> 20:59.000
Wow, I would love

20:56.500 --> 20:59.000
to get to know you,

20:59.041 --> 21:02.333
But you probably have all kinds

20:59.041 --> 21:02.333
of important things to do

21:02.375 --> 21:04.834
So I guess

21:02.375 --> 21:04.834
you're about to leave.

21:04.875 --> 21:06.333
Right.

21:06.375 --> 21:09.291
You be careful, miss.

21:09.333 --> 21:10.917
I will.

21:13.542 --> 21:15.625
Oh, and that guy you like?

21:15.667 --> 21:17.792
You should make him a pie.

21:18.917 --> 21:20.458
Well, bye.

21:26.458 --> 21:29.500
Okay, this is amazing pie.

21:29.542 --> 21:31.083
Ooh, it's so good.

21:31.125 --> 21:34.959
Oh, yeah. Let's give it up

21:31.125 --> 21:34.959
for Bianca's coconut cream pie.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.125
(cheering)

21:37.166 --> 21:38.458
Best pie.

21:40.000 --> 21:40.959
Okay, my turn.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.250
Well, roll the dice, then.

21:42.291 --> 21:44.583
Yeah, baby.

21:46.000 --> 21:46.834
I got a six.
