WEBVTT

00:12.250 --> 00:14.625
-(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
-BILL MAHER: We've done okay.

00:14.709 --> 00:18.625
Uh... Catherine,
which economic
threat is most likely

00:18.834 --> 00:20.583
to trigger the next recession?

00:21.834 --> 00:24.083
-Uh... Trump. (CHUCKLES)
-(LAUGHTER)

00:24.166 --> 00:28.583
Right now. Normally, I would say
presidents get too much credit
when the economy is good,

00:28.667 --> 00:30.959
-too much blame
when the economy is bad.
-BILL: Right.

00:31.208 --> 00:32.542
I've been saying that
for months.

00:32.792 --> 00:35.166
People ask me about Trump
versus Obama in the economy,
and whatever else,

00:35.375 --> 00:39.542
but Trump is making so many
unforced errors at this point,
uh...

00:39.917 --> 00:44.125
everything from the trade wars,
plural,
to the government shutdown,

00:44.291 --> 00:46.959
to threatening the independence
of the Federal Reserve--

00:47.041 --> 00:49.375
I'm amazed it's lasted
this long, the economy.

00:49.458 --> 00:52.625
Well, I mean, in a sense,
it's surprising statistically,

00:52.709 --> 00:55.583
because this is now
the second-longest recovery
on record.

00:55.667 --> 00:56.625
BILL: Right.

00:57.583 --> 00:59.667
In history. In all of history.
So, it's like, a little long
in the tooth, no matter what.

00:59.750 --> 01:02.375
It's surprising that it has
still stuck around,

01:02.583 --> 01:05.208
given all of the policy errors
that Trump has made.

01:05.458 --> 01:07.208
So, that's what I'm worried
about at this point.

01:07.291 --> 01:10.542
And we don't have a lot
of money to bail banks out
like we did last time.

01:10.750 --> 01:15.709
Or... Well, partly because we
just spent two trillion dollars
on a tax cut for the rich.

01:15.792 --> 01:19.166
Is your law with your name on it
still working? Or did they--

01:19.250 --> 01:20.583
It's-- It's in good shape, yeah.

01:20.667 --> 01:22.041
BILL: It is? They didn't--
They weren't able to...

01:22.125 --> 01:25.208
What they've been able to do,
particularly with
the Consumer Bureau,

01:25.291 --> 01:28.709
is not administer it,
but they didn't even dare
try to change it.

01:29.166 --> 01:35.083
And... it's still mostly
in good shape, and it
has stopped the bad stuff.

01:35.166 --> 01:36.500
But Catherine is
absolutely right...

01:37.166 --> 01:39.083
and I think that's the biggest
economic problem,

01:39.166 --> 01:44.125
we got this artificial rush
from the tax cut,
and that's petering out.

01:44.375 --> 01:46.917
And by the way,
that's what happened
to infrastructure.

01:47.542 --> 01:49.917
We spent the infrastructure
money on the tax cut,

01:50.000 --> 01:53.417
that's why there will be
no significant infrastructure
improvement,

01:53.500 --> 01:55.583
-which could give the economy
the right kind of boost.
-Bill: Right.

01:55.667 --> 01:57.500
Because it all went
for the tax cut.

01:57.583 --> 02:01.333
Okay, Marshawn Lynch,
did you try and light a blunt

02:01.417 --> 02:05.125
off Al Davis's eternal flame
at the last Raiders game
in Oakland?

02:05.208 --> 02:06.125
(LAUGHTER)

02:06.208 --> 02:07.250
I think you did.

02:07.333 --> 02:08.959
-I did.
-You did do that, yes.

02:09.041 --> 02:09.959
(LAUGHTER)

02:10.041 --> 02:11.000
True.

02:11.083 --> 02:12.041
(CHEERING)

02:12.375 --> 02:14.875
I think it was--
I think it was only right to
send a...

02:15.125 --> 02:20.083
You know, I think it was only
right to send the Raiders off
in a real Oakland--

02:20.166 --> 02:21.709
-in a real Oakland way.
-BILL: Right. And were you--

02:21.792 --> 02:22.709
(LAUGHTER)

02:23.041 --> 02:24.417
BILL: Were there repercussions
from the NFL for that?

02:24.500 --> 02:26.583
I mean, I don't think
they caught on yet,
but I mean...

02:26.667 --> 02:27.667
(LAUGHTER)

02:27.750 --> 02:29.333
-I'm pretty sure now,
at this point...
-Yeah.

02:29.417 --> 02:30.375
(LAUGHTER)

02:30.458 --> 02:31.417
Something'll take place.

02:31.792 --> 02:33.875
-They got you for Skittles
on your sneakers...
-(LAUGHS)

02:33.959 --> 02:37.458
...but they let you light
a blunt off of
a guy's eternal flame?

02:37.542 --> 02:38.417
(LAUGHTER)

02:38.500 --> 02:39.792
That's not a very bright league,
is it?

02:39.875 --> 02:41.709
Nah, man. Just win, baby.

02:41.792 --> 02:43.625
Yeah-- That's Al Davis, right.

02:43.959 --> 02:47.709
Um... Okay. Um... Barney,
do you hope Democrats
will push for--

02:47.792 --> 02:50.333
Oh, no, I guess I asked you
that. Um...

02:50.417 --> 02:53.458
Do you think
Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez is
a good fit

02:53.542 --> 02:55.750
for the House Financial
Services Committee?

02:56.875 --> 02:59.500
-Um...
-She's doing great so far, boy,
what a star.

02:59.583 --> 03:03.333
I hope she is. Well, I--
I have a problem
with some of this...

03:03.917 --> 03:07.417
Having people do a sit-in
in Nancy Pelosi's office
was really stupid.

03:07.834 --> 03:10.291
Um... Here's the deal,
I think it is important...

03:11.250 --> 03:16.417
I worry about people on the left
picking an easy fight
with their friends

03:16.500 --> 03:19.583
on the near-left,
as opposed to fighting
the real enemy.

03:19.792 --> 03:22.041
That's what I was just saying,
and you were yelling at me.

03:22.125 --> 03:24.875
-(LAUGHTER)
-No, you were talking
about signaling...

03:25.208 --> 03:27.500
-(LAUGHTER)
-I agree on the first thing.

03:27.583 --> 03:31.166
No, I said people should get a--
I agree people should get
a second--

03:31.250 --> 03:32.917
I think Liberals have been
inconsistent in saying

03:33.000 --> 03:36.291
no second chance for
sexual harassment,
but yes for robbery.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.625
I think...
So, I agree with that.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.583
But I do think she has a problem
in misidentifying--

03:43.667 --> 03:46.667
She thinks the reason we're not
doing better is that...

03:47.625 --> 03:49.625
some of the liberals haven't
been fighting hard enough.

03:49.709 --> 03:53.458
I think the problem is the...
the opposition
of the Republicans,

03:53.542 --> 03:58.125
so I hope she has--
puts all the energy into
fighting the right enemy.

03:58.291 --> 04:00.458
Erick Erickson,
should Steve King's comments

04:00.542 --> 04:02.458
be viewed as
an isolated incident,

04:02.542 --> 04:06.291
or are they a symptom of
racism dominating
the Republican Party?

04:06.667 --> 04:10.041
I think they are a Steve King
problem, but I think
there's a real problem

04:10.125 --> 04:14.000
with Republicans who weren't
willing to speak up
quickly about them.

04:14.208 --> 04:16.250
Uh... You know,
I've known Steve King

04:16.333 --> 04:20.709
and I've kind of been shocked
at this evolution of him.
I don't know him well...

04:22.000 --> 04:24.166
but he's all of a sudden
very blatant about things

04:24.250 --> 04:26.083
I didn't even know
he believed, and--

04:26.166 --> 04:28.333
It's a common occurrence,
I find--

04:28.625 --> 04:33.166
It really is, it's symptomatic
of this presidential
administration

04:33.250 --> 04:36.500
-making people feel comfortable
being assholes...
-CATHERINE: Yeah, but--

04:36.583 --> 04:39.041
-when they didn't necessarily...
-BILL: Yes.

04:39.125 --> 04:40.917
-openly do it in the past.
-That's true, okay, but...

04:41.000 --> 04:45.166
Steve King-- Steve King
has been making these comments
for years, if not decades.

04:45.458 --> 04:48.542
I mean, the "calves as big
as cantaloupes" comments...

04:48.625 --> 04:50.500
See, I had never heard the--
And you're right,

04:50.583 --> 04:52.875
the New York Times
ran a long timeline
of comments he had made

04:52.959 --> 04:54.542
that I had never even heard,
but this latest--

04:54.625 --> 04:55.542
BILL: But they got worse.

04:55.625 --> 04:58.208
To see people defending him,
too, saying,

04:58.417 --> 05:00.458
"Oh, that's not really
what he meant..."
It was what he meant.

05:00.542 --> 05:01.500
CATHERINE: Yeah.

05:02.291 --> 05:04.542
And I do think the Republicans--
You've got Tim Scott
calling out the Republicans,

05:04.625 --> 05:05.542
and I think it's right.

05:06.250 --> 05:09.125
Uh... If the Republicans
can't clean their own house,
the voters totally will.

05:09.208 --> 05:11.208
And at some point
they're gonna stop worrying
about cleaning

05:11.291 --> 05:13.083
the Republican's house,
they're just
gonna pour kerosene

05:13.166 --> 05:15.375
around the outside
of the party and strike a match.

05:15.709 --> 05:17.458
(AUDIENCE MURMURS, APPLAUDS)

05:17.542 --> 05:19.291
Yeah, I've seen so many people
though who used to be

05:19.500 --> 05:22.208
what I would call
"normal Republicans,"
who then--

05:22.291 --> 05:23.333
ERICK: ...lost their minds.

05:24.166 --> 05:28.583
Devin Nunes had some pretty
smart quotes, I swear to God.
I read them on this show...

05:28.667 --> 05:30.750
years ago.
He became this person.

05:31.041 --> 05:33.291
It happens a lot.
I think it's Fox News.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.375
I think they get sucked
into the Fox News vortex--

05:35.458 --> 05:37.875
See, I don't think it is,
I think that...

05:38.500 --> 05:40.583
it has become this cult
of personality
with the president.

05:40.667 --> 05:43.583
I mean, I had people show up
at my house to threaten
my family,

05:43.667 --> 05:45.208
because I said I wasn't
gonna vote for the guy,

05:45.291 --> 05:48.041
and I'm a Republican--
I was a Republican
on my city council

05:48.125 --> 05:49.417
and they still showed up
to threaten me,

05:49.500 --> 05:51.291
yelled at my kids
in the grocery store.

05:51.375 --> 05:55.500
It's... These people,
they feel comfortable fighting
out in public, being jerks.

05:55.583 --> 05:58.083
I think you're right. Trump
is an extraordinary figure.

05:58.458 --> 06:01.166
He can get away with crap
that nobody else
can get away with,

06:01.250 --> 06:02.208
but people don't see that.

06:02.291 --> 06:03.917
And I think too many
people think,

06:04.000 --> 06:06.375
-"Hey, look at how
it has paid off for Trump."
-ERICK: Yes.

06:06.458 --> 06:08.583
-"This guy,
totally unqualified..."
-BILL: Right.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.291
"long-shot becomes president."
So, people think they
can be Trump and they can't.

06:13.375 --> 06:15.083
Our generation
is growing up with that, too.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.208
-BARNEY: What's that?
-I said, "Our generation
is growing up with that, too."

06:18.291 --> 06:19.709
-BARNEY: But that's-- that...
-BILL: "Our generation"?

06:19.792 --> 06:21.041
-...gives some of these people.
-MARSHAWN: Yeah.

06:21.125 --> 06:23.083
-(LAUGHTER)
-Yo, we right there.

06:23.625 --> 06:27.375
I think the Republican Party
has been dog whistling
for decades,

06:27.458 --> 06:31.917
and it was just, you know,
couched a little bit
in more politeness before.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.875
And the dog whistle became
audible to human ears
in the last few years,

06:35.959 --> 06:39.542
because of Trump, but I think
that strain has been there
for a very long time.

06:39.625 --> 06:41.583
-Who did you vote for last time?
-I didn't.

06:41.667 --> 06:42.834
-You didn't?
-Nah.

06:42.917 --> 06:43.959
Oh, no, that's not right.

06:44.333 --> 06:47.917
Yeah, I know it's not,
but I don't--
Like, this politics shit,

06:48.375 --> 06:51.500
-that shit is crazy.
-(LAUGHTER)

06:52.250 --> 06:54.000
BILL: You know what show
you agreed to come on?

06:54.083 --> 06:57.125
Look-- Look, though--
Look, I get down and I--

06:57.208 --> 07:01.417
I mean, I respect people
for what they believe in,

07:01.500 --> 07:03.625
and all this shit,
but at the end of the day,

07:03.709 --> 07:07.417
like, if you not
a solid individual,
then fuck you.

07:07.500 --> 07:10.125
-That's just how
I feel personally.
-(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

07:10.208 --> 07:13.625
But whoever is president,
and who are our leaders
in the Senate and the House,

07:13.709 --> 07:16.917
-they do affect people's lives.
-They do. You're right,
they do affect--

07:17.000 --> 07:20.125
-Politics affects people's lives
in a very real way.
-They do.

07:20.208 --> 07:22.417
You know, John Kasich,
the Republican governor,

07:22.500 --> 07:25.667
I said to him, "You did what
most Republican governors
didn't do."

07:25.834 --> 07:28.333
-He expanded Medicaid
in his state.
-Mm-hm.

07:28.417 --> 07:32.959
That means hundreds of thousands
of poor people got to see
a doctor. That's real shit.

07:33.208 --> 07:35.500
-(APPLAUSE)
-Right.
-And that the...

07:36.667 --> 07:39.750
What happens
in the voting booth,
down stream...

07:39.834 --> 07:41.583
So, like, what I know about,
like--

07:42.542 --> 07:46.458
'Cause, I mean, like,
I understand that. Like,
I'm in the communities and shit,

07:46.542 --> 07:48.625
though, so like,
when I go to these--

07:48.709 --> 07:51.959
Like, me being from Oakland,
but then I'll go to Miami.

07:52.041 --> 07:56.542
A hood in Miami,
or a hood in Saginaw
or somewhere like that.

07:56.750 --> 07:58.417
Like, a lot of those people
don't...

07:58.750 --> 08:01.792
Even though those services
are out there,
for whatever reason,

08:01.875 --> 08:04.250
it don't reach all
of the people, and therefore,

08:04.542 --> 08:08.417
they're still struggling
from that. And I mean,
at the end of the day, like...

08:09.166 --> 08:12.166
-But that's why you need
a good community organizer.
-I mean, you do.

08:12.250 --> 08:13.417
BARNEY: Can I say, Marshawn,
you've got some great--

08:13.750 --> 08:15.375
You had Ron Dellums,
who was a great man,
who was Mayor of Oakland.

08:15.458 --> 08:18.625
You had Congresswoman
Barbara Lee who was
an outstanding moral leader.

08:18.959 --> 08:21.375
You should be voting
for these people,
because that's standing up.

08:21.709 --> 08:25.000
-BILL: Right.
-Look, I get out there and I
just get down with the people.

08:25.583 --> 08:28.041
-BILL: Okay.
-I mean, regardless
to all of that, I just--

08:28.125 --> 08:29.834
-BARNEY: But you got
some strong allies.
-It's time--

08:29.917 --> 08:32.625
I mean, you do, but I mean,
at the end of the day,
dealing with...

08:33.625 --> 08:36.000
Like, going and dealing with
politicians right now,

08:36.250 --> 08:39.834
I get into situation where
I wanna do something
in my community...

08:40.417 --> 08:44.458
to benefit more of the youth,
and if it don't come with
a pay-check,

08:44.542 --> 08:47.125
for some of them,
they not interested
in what I say--

08:47.208 --> 08:49.291
That's not true of
your Oakland representatives.

08:49.375 --> 08:54.000
So, therefore-- So, therefore,
what I do is, I just hit
the hood and run it myself.

08:55.083 --> 09:00.125
I'll pack up a fucking U-Haul
with either turkeys,
toys for the kids,

09:00.208 --> 09:02.417
and I'm out there
just giving them out myself.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.208
But that's not
a long-term solution.

09:04.291 --> 09:06.917
-It's not a long-term solution.
-You can't do that--
You can't buy turkeys--

09:07.000 --> 09:08.834
BARNEY: Don't you wanna
encourage the good ones?
Some are bad.

09:09.125 --> 09:10.709
But you've had, again,
in Oakland,

09:10.792 --> 09:12.250
some very good
outstanding people,

09:12.333 --> 09:14.291
who are very community rooted;
don't you wanna encourage them?

09:14.375 --> 09:17.375
-You're saying some of them
are good...
-BARNEY: Yep.

09:17.458 --> 09:21.333
...and some of them are bad,
but the same conditions
in which Oakland was in

09:21.417 --> 09:25.875
back then, they still in
the same situations now,
so I mean, like..

09:25.959 --> 09:26.834
But they're trying to
make it better,

09:27.166 --> 09:28.542
and if there were more of them,
they could succeed.

09:28.625 --> 09:29.667
BILL: That's it.

09:29.750 --> 09:31.083
So then, where they at then?

09:31.417 --> 09:34.250
I mean, look at California,
when this state,
they said about five years ago,

09:34.333 --> 09:37.000
before Jerry Brown
became governor,
they said it was ungovernable,

09:37.083 --> 09:40.083
remember?
They said it was a failed state.

09:40.291 --> 09:44.125
And then we elected
a Democratic governor
with a Democratic legislature

09:44.208 --> 09:47.834
and our state did a lot better,
and people did a lot better,
and we have a surplus...

09:47.917 --> 09:49.875
-and it rains now.
-(APPLAUSE)

09:49.959 --> 09:51.041
It rains!

09:51.417 --> 09:53.458
-We got water!
-All right, we gotta go.

09:53.542 --> 09:56.250
It's time to party
with the people.
Thank you, everybody.
