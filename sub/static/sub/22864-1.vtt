00:26.259 --> 00:29.628
- The tropical places, you
know, that's the go-to,

00:29.630 --> 00:32.097
get your white sands and your
blue water,

00:32.098 --> 00:35.000
and your fuckin' guava trees
and whatever,

00:35.002 --> 00:38.337
and it makes a beautiful
postcard, but I burn.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.072
And I can't, you know,
it's just not,

00:40.074 --> 00:42.474
it's not relaxing to
me if I got my mai tai

00:42.476 --> 00:44.576
and my pina-umbrella-whatever
thing,

00:44.578 --> 00:47.613
and I forget to put on my
spf infinity,

00:47.615 --> 00:50.082
sweater in a bottle,
and then the next day,

00:50.084 --> 00:52.251
I can't wipe my own
ass without discomfort,

00:52.253 --> 00:54.019
exceptional discomfort.

00:54.021 --> 00:56.755
And then, I gotta stay
outta the sun

00:56.757 --> 00:58.190
and deal with all that bullshit,

00:58.192 --> 01:00.359
and what's the point
of being in the tropics

01:00.361 --> 01:02.761
if you gotta act like some
fuckin' nerd on summer break

01:02.763 --> 01:05.964
reading a hobbit book
in his bedroom.

01:05.966 --> 01:08.367
So a more temperate climate,

01:10.070 --> 01:12.771
that's what I'm lookin'
for from this,

01:12.773 --> 01:15.574
from a getaway standpoint.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.875
What about you?

01:19.112 --> 01:21.213
- It'd be nice to meet somebody.

01:21.215 --> 01:21.213
- What?

01:21.215 --> 01:26.385
- You know, just somebody
new, get unstuck.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.654
- That's kind of a lot
to pin on a,

01:28.656 --> 01:28.654
I'm just sayin', I was talking

01:28.656 --> 01:32.057
about a more temperate climate
and you're talkin' about

01:32.059 --> 01:35.360
some measure of human
emotion, one of which,

01:35.362 --> 01:37.362
by the way, you can find
on a map.

01:37.364 --> 01:38.464
- We're just talking here,
right?

01:38.466 --> 01:38.464
- Sure.

01:38.466 --> 01:40.399
- Well, you're goin'
off like we just pulled

01:40.401 --> 01:41.800
some master diamond heist.

01:41.802 --> 01:42.801
- I'm just saying eventually...

01:42.803 --> 01:43.936
- haven't even found a place...

01:43.938 --> 01:46.705
- we are looking, right?

01:46.707 --> 01:50.409
There's the check cashing
place we talked about.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.411
Mm, that's a rough crowd,

01:52.413 --> 01:56.682
something goes wrong, it
goes all the way wrong.

01:56.684 --> 01:56.682
The flower shop...

01:56.684 --> 02:01.253
- no, she's nice, and I met
her daughter that one time,

02:01.255 --> 02:02.221
so that makes it really...

02:02.223 --> 02:03.422
- you shouldn't have been
shopping there.

02:03.424 --> 02:04.490
- I was casing the joint!

02:04.492 --> 02:05.624
- You could've cased
the fuckin' louvre

02:05.626 --> 02:06.959
for the amount of time
you spent there!

02:06.961 --> 02:09.061
- She has nice eyes and she
found her passion in flowers,

02:09.062 --> 02:10.662
and I don't wanna rob her!

02:10.663 --> 02:12.197
Some people have no
idea what they wanna do

02:12.199 --> 02:13.098
with their lives and she...

02:13.100 --> 02:14.433
- fine, fine, I get it!

02:14.435 --> 02:16.902
- Besides, I found the place.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.238
- I found the flower shop.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.306
- No, I mean, the place.

02:22.876 --> 02:23.709
- Yeah?

02:23.711 --> 02:26.111
- Yeah, it's perfect.

02:26.113 --> 02:27.113
Unexpected.

02:29.215 --> 02:30.883
- Is it this place?

02:30.885 --> 02:31.984
- What?

02:31.986 --> 02:34.586
- Oh, man, yeah, this
is like Pulp Fiction!

02:34.588 --> 02:35.787
- What shitty part of
Pulp Fiction

02:35.789 --> 02:37.022
would this possibly be like?

02:37.024 --> 02:38.290
- You know, the opening part
with, uh,

02:38.292 --> 02:39.992
honey bunny and pumpkin and, uh,

02:39.994 --> 02:42.161
"any of you fucking pricks move,

02:42.163 --> 02:45.464
"I'm gonna execute every
motherfuckin' last one of ya!"

02:45.466 --> 02:46.532
- Shh, Jesus!

02:46.534 --> 02:48.634
- Yeah, yeah, I'm into it, let's
do it!

02:48.636 --> 02:50.002
- What are we gonna rob the
diner with,

02:50.004 --> 02:52.704
our fuckin' coffee spoons?

02:52.706 --> 02:52.704
We should at least order

02:52.706 --> 02:56.275
the steak and eggs
first so we have knives!

02:56.277 --> 02:57.409
- You guys ready
to order?

02:57.411 --> 03:00.412
- Yeah, I'll have the, uh, steak
and eggs.

03:00.414 --> 03:04.816
- What is the
finest item on your menu?

03:04.818 --> 03:08.153
- Ooh, uh, my favorite is
the chocolate chip pancakes.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.788
Super tasty.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.323
- Eh.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.891
- You don't like pancakes?

03:12.893 --> 03:15.160
- No, it's just, uh,

03:15.162 --> 03:18.130
that's my ex-fiancee's favorite,
so,

03:18.132 --> 03:21.099
kind of a loaded menu
option for me.

03:21.101 --> 03:23.669
Um, the Denver omelet, thanks.

03:27.509 --> 03:28.408
- Wow.

03:28.409 --> 03:33.011
- What, I don't want chocolate
chip pancakes, so what?

03:33.013 --> 03:34.947
It's breakfast, not dessert.

03:34.949 --> 03:36.348
- Perfect, say that.

03:36.350 --> 03:36.348
- Do you wanna hear
about the place

03:36.350 --> 03:40.652
or do you wanna be my fuckin'
life coach?

03:41.621 --> 03:45.257
It's a house, I know how
to get in.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.025
I know there's valuable jewelry,

03:47.027 --> 03:50.062
and I know that they're
gone all week.

03:50.064 --> 03:51.196
- Which week?

03:51.198 --> 03:52.664
- This week, now.

03:55.568 --> 03:59.171
- Holy shit, this is
real, this is really real!

03:59.173 --> 04:03.842
- There is one part, um,
it's in a gated community,

04:03.844 --> 04:06.645
so there's a guard and a gate

04:06.647 --> 04:10.649
and a fence around the whole
thing, so.

04:10.651 --> 04:11.717
I know how to get in the house,

04:11.719 --> 04:15.287
I just don't know how to get to
the house.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.558
- Well, I do.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.513
We'd like to order a pizza,
please.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.615
- For here or to go?

05:16.617 --> 05:17.916
- For delivery.

05:51.918 --> 05:53.218
- We're here.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.520
- And that's how you do it.

06:04.731 --> 06:07.599
This is for you,
my good man.

06:10.037 --> 06:10.936
- Dude!

06:10.938 --> 06:14.673
- You get the other half
when you pick us up.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.341
- Ah, this is bullshit!

06:16.343 --> 06:18.343
At least pay for the pizza, man!

06:18.345 --> 06:19.778
This is all the way
the hell out here,

06:19.780 --> 06:22.347
how am I gonna account
for this on the books?

06:22.349 --> 06:23.349
- Fine!

06:26.052 --> 06:28.453
Now, remember, this address,

06:29.756 --> 06:33.425
plus a sausage, mushroom,
and anchovy pizza.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.394
That's the code to come
pick us up.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.229
- Yeah, the address is fine.

06:37.231 --> 06:37.229
I mean, no one's gonna come...

06:37.231 --> 06:42.367
- whoa, whoa, let's not get
our signals crossed here, ok?

06:42.369 --> 06:44.436
Just stick to the plan.

06:44.438 --> 06:45.438
- Whatever!

06:46.572 --> 06:48.073
- Whoa, hey, whoa.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.709
You know, since we paid for it.

06:53.012 --> 06:58.016
- What if there's no
hide-a-rock?

06:58.018 --> 07:00.085
- There is!

07:00.087 --> 07:01.052
- How do you know?

07:01.054 --> 07:02.821
- Because I know,
we wouldn't be here

07:02.823 --> 07:04.055
if there wasn't a hide-a-rock.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.257
- Then why haven't you
found it?

07:05.259 --> 07:07.092
- Because it looks like a
fuckin' rock!

07:07.094 --> 07:09.661
That's the beauty of its design!

07:12.733 --> 07:15.333
- I've got no bars, why
would you pay all this money

07:15.335 --> 07:18.236
to live up in a place
with no bars?

07:18.238 --> 07:21.740
I have to call the pizza
guy from inside, I guess.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.409
That'll actually make it seem
more legit.

07:24.411 --> 07:28.647
Yeah, the caller ID shows this
address, the guy picks us up.

07:29.782 --> 07:34.019
Nothin' funny about that,
nothin' to pin it to us.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.087
It's almost too perfect.

07:37.757 --> 07:38.590
Leo?

07:38.592 --> 07:38.590
- Yeah?

07:38.592 --> 07:40.892
- I was saying we have to
call the pizza guy from...

07:40.894 --> 07:42.627
- I heard you.

07:43.897 --> 07:44.897
Hear that?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.337
What was that?

07:52.339 --> 07:53.505
- Don't move.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.007
It's an alarm.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.910
- Shit, I didn't know
about the alarm.

07:58.912 --> 08:02.214
- It's ok, just there
might be motion detectors.

08:02.216 --> 08:03.482
- Like lasers?

08:03.484 --> 08:05.283
- Maybe, or infrared.

08:06.752 --> 08:09.488
You know, everything gives
off infrared heat, even ice?

08:09.490 --> 08:10.689
- That's fucking fascinating,

08:10.691 --> 08:12.157
do you know what
you're doing there?

08:12.159 --> 08:15.093
- Yeah, getting it.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.262
- What does that mean,
you're getting it?

08:17.264 --> 08:19.097
- I've established a pattern,

08:19.099 --> 08:22.367
and I'm working within the
confines of that pattern

08:22.369 --> 08:24.102
to decipher the, oh!

08:24.104 --> 08:26.838
- Incorrect,
system armed!

08:26.840 --> 08:29.140
- Armed, you just armed it?

08:30.643 --> 08:33.745
So now we have to break out of
the house we just broke into?

08:33.746 --> 08:36.047
- I mean, if anything, it proves
that the pattern was right.

08:36.049 --> 08:39.918
I just went in the wrong
direction with it, right?

08:39.919 --> 08:40.751
If I reverse...

08:40.754 --> 08:42.120
- no, don't touch it!

08:42.121 --> 08:43.421
It's fuckin' armed!

08:43.423 --> 08:44.990
- I know, I'm going to unarm it!

08:44.992 --> 08:47.125
- No, you're not, you're gonna
set it off,

08:47.127 --> 08:48.960
and then the guard's gonna
be here in six seconds,

08:48.962 --> 08:50.762
cops are gonna be
right behind him,

08:50.764 --> 08:52.564
and then we're gonna be
stuck here with nowhere to go

08:52.566 --> 08:53.398
because we're in the middle

08:53.400 --> 08:56.234
of a giant gated,
fenced-in cage!

08:57.770 --> 09:00.105
- Ok, yeah, it's not ideal,

09:00.873 --> 09:03.408
but it's not a problem.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.143
There's a code
and it's written down

09:05.145 --> 09:07.312
somewhere in this house,

09:07.314 --> 09:09.214
maybe on their computer,
in an email

09:09.216 --> 09:12.284
from the security company
or somethin' like that.

09:12.286 --> 09:16.221
We just take our time, find the
code while we rob the place,

09:16.223 --> 09:19.190
and then skedaddle,
clean and easy.

09:20.993 --> 09:23.895
- What about the
motion detectors?

09:34.007 --> 09:35.907
- No motion detectors.

09:44.617 --> 09:45.617
Good find!

09:46.686 --> 09:47.552
- Huh?

09:47.554 --> 09:49.521
- This place is swanky!

09:50.723 --> 09:51.723
- It's ok.

09:52.558 --> 09:54.192
- Ok, look at this!

09:56.996 --> 09:58.697
- What is it?

09:58.699 --> 10:01.633
- This is art, they have
art hanging on the walls.

10:01.635 --> 10:04.369
That's some ritzy people shit!

10:04.371 --> 10:06.438
We're gonna score
huge on this job.

10:15.481 --> 10:16.848
- Uh, what are you doing?

10:16.850 --> 10:19.017
- Stealing this,
it looks expensive.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.219
- We're not gonna steal a bowl.

10:21.221 --> 10:24.322
We need small things that
we can fit in our bags.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.658
- Or in a pizza box, right?

10:26.660 --> 10:28.293
We could put a painting in here.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.862
Let's eat this fast so the
box doesn't get all sweaty.

10:30.864 --> 10:31.864
Here.

10:34.668 --> 10:35.567
- What the fuck?

10:35.569 --> 10:36.968
- What?

10:36.970 --> 10:38.937
- You just ruined that rug,
look at that!

10:38.939 --> 10:40.505
Show some respect!

10:41.307 --> 10:43.241
- We are robbing this place.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.010
- We don't have to rub their
faces in it!

10:45.012 --> 10:46.144
I mean, shit!

10:48.080 --> 10:49.648
That's a nice rug!

10:50.683 --> 10:53.418
- Ok, I-i don't know, I'm sorry?

10:53.420 --> 10:56.054
I don't know what's going on
right now.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.827
Yeah, it's ruined.

11:13.973 --> 11:15.006
Bingo!

11:15.008 --> 11:15.006
- What?

11:15.008 --> 11:18.677
- Office, where would you
keep a code?

11:18.679 --> 11:21.279
- I don't know,
I don't have an office.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.281
- Computer!

11:23.983 --> 11:26.084
Oh, maybe it's in a
drawer or something.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.852
- Hey, why don't we
just go out the window.

11:27.854 --> 11:30.522
- No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

11:30.524 --> 11:33.525
Sensor, my sister has one of
these getups at her house.

11:33.527 --> 11:34.959
Try to smoke a little weed at
the end

11:34.961 --> 11:37.462
of a stressful day
with the family,

11:37.464 --> 11:39.364
suddenly, the whole damn
neighborhood's awake

11:39.366 --> 11:44.135
and they have questions
about your life's decisions.

11:44.971 --> 11:45.970
Oh!

11:45.972 --> 11:46.838
- Where are you going?

11:46.840 --> 11:46.838
11:11.

11:46.840 --> 11:51.910
- No, come on, we have
to find the.

11:53.979 --> 11:55.613
- Hand me that phone.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.248
- You can't just
skip this one?

11:57.250 --> 11:58.983
- It takes a minute.

11:59.819 --> 12:00.852
It's 11:11,

12:00.854 --> 12:03.254
time for
the impossible question!

12:03.256 --> 12:05.056
You guys know the deal,
but it's fun to say it!

12:05.058 --> 12:08.126
$104,800, that's what
we're up to,

12:08.128 --> 12:11.663
it's been 524 days since
a good soul has won.

12:11.665 --> 12:13.665
Twice a day, every day at 11:11,

12:13.667 --> 12:15.967
we pose the impossible question!

12:15.969 --> 12:17.736
The generous folks
at black bear markets

12:17.738 --> 12:19.637
add another hundred dollars
to the kitty.

12:19.639 --> 12:20.839
Ya call with a correct answer

12:20.841 --> 12:24.075
within 22 seconds, and you win
it all!

12:24.977 --> 12:26.411
It would be so simple

12:26.413 --> 12:28.546
if it weren't impossible!

12:32.384 --> 12:34.152
- So
phone's ready.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.421
Here it comes.
- What the fuck?

12:36.423 --> 12:39.390
- Shh!

12:39.392 --> 12:40.992
What were the last words

12:40.994 --> 12:43.762
of the first man to
commit suicide

12:43.764 --> 12:46.264
by jumping off
the golden gate bridge?

12:46.266 --> 12:48.399
- Come on, that's just!

12:48.401 --> 12:49.667
- Oh, wait, you don't
wanna hear the answer?

12:49.669 --> 12:51.636
- Some asshole is gonna win,

12:51.638 --> 12:53.938
and then the next day,
I'm gonna know the answer,

12:53.940 --> 12:56.875
and then only win a
hundred damn dollars!

12:56.877 --> 12:59.978
I believe I'd take
to a clock tower.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.313
- Wonder how cold that water is.

13:02.315 --> 13:03.281
- Huh?

13:03.283 --> 13:05.016
- Those would be
cool last words.

13:05.018 --> 13:09.254
You say, "I wonder how cold
that water is," and then.

13:12.158 --> 13:14.926
- Come on, let's rob this place.

13:58.738 --> 13:59.571
Who the fuck is that?

13:59.573 --> 14:00.405
- I don't know.

14:00.407 --> 14:01.306
- You said no one was here!

14:01.308 --> 14:02.640
- She's not the person
who lives here.

14:02.642 --> 14:03.474
- How do you know?

14:03.476 --> 14:04.776
- Because I did my research.

14:04.778 --> 14:06.311
- Then why wasn't
she in your research?

14:06.313 --> 14:07.312
- She doesn't live here!

14:07.314 --> 14:08.546
- Well who the fuck is that!

14:08.548 --> 14:09.747
- I don't know!

14:09.749 --> 14:10.749
- Fuck!

14:12.585 --> 14:14.719
- We gotta cut bait, just get
out of here.

14:14.721 --> 14:14.719
- Out of where?

14:14.721 --> 14:17.722
- Out of the house,
just go, problem solved.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.824
- We can't, the alarm.

14:20.927 --> 14:22.660
Ah, we take a chair,

14:23.796 --> 14:25.763
and we shove
it under the doorknob.

14:25.765 --> 14:27.098
- And then what?

14:27.100 --> 14:28.166
- She's stuck!

14:28.168 --> 14:30.602
- So she'll call for help.

14:30.604 --> 14:32.170
- Like on the phone
or out the window?

14:32.172 --> 14:33.671
- W-what does that matter?

14:33.673 --> 14:34.673
- Uh, ok.

14:36.308 --> 14:38.977
Ha, hmm, we have to tie her up.

14:41.113 --> 14:42.647
- What?

14:42.649 --> 14:44.482
- Look, we need time!

14:45.251 --> 14:47.619
We don't have time
if she finds us.

14:47.621 --> 14:51.089
If she wakes up, she's going to
find us.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.324
So, we have to tie her up.

15:11.510 --> 15:12.510
Here we go!

15:18.984 --> 15:21.152
Yeah, ok, we'll use that.

15:21.154 --> 15:25.657
- What about our faces,
she can't see our faces.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.860
Ok, we wrap her in the sheet

15:28.862 --> 15:30.628
and just tape the
shit out of her.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.330
- Why are we
wrapping her in the sheet?

15:32.332 --> 15:33.464
- This is duct tape, man.

15:33.466 --> 15:33.464
- So?

15:33.466 --> 15:35.867
- So it's gonna
rip her fuckin' skin off!

15:35.869 --> 15:37.568
We're burglars, not assholes.

15:37.570 --> 15:41.172
- Fine, you go high,
I go low.

15:43.476 --> 15:44.575
- Sorry!

15:44.577 --> 15:45.743
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:45.745 --> 15:46.844
- Sorry, sorry!

15:46.846 --> 15:47.712
- Shut up!

15:47.714 --> 15:48.980
- Help!

15:48.982 --> 15:51.316
- It's ok, we're just
taping you!

15:51.318 --> 15:51.316
- Help!

15:51.318 --> 15:53.651
- Shut up, no one can
hear you!

15:53.653 --> 15:55.153
- Don't be a dick
about it,

15:55.155 --> 15:57.055
but he's right,
no one can hear you.

15:59.859 --> 16:00.825
You good?

16:00.827 --> 16:02.226
- Yeah.

16:05.231 --> 16:06.064
- What the hell?

16:06.066 --> 16:06.898
- Dah, my leg!

16:06.900 --> 16:06.898
- What?

16:06.900 --> 16:09.133
- You taped my left,
cut me loose.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.335
- Ok.

16:10.337 --> 16:11.302
Will you hold still?

16:11.304 --> 16:12.670
- I'm not doing anything, he's...

16:12.672 --> 16:13.938
- I'm trying to kick free!

16:13.940 --> 16:16.507
- You can't
kick free, I have to cut,

16:16.509 --> 16:18.242
ha-ha!

16:18.244 --> 16:19.544
- Don't hurt me, don't
hurt me!

16:19.546 --> 16:21.579
- Wh, oh, we're not
gonna hurt you,

16:21.581 --> 16:22.914
we're just gonna
steal some stuff

16:22.916 --> 16:26.117
and then we're gonna,
oh shit!

16:26.119 --> 16:27.185
- What?
- My mask!

16:27.187 --> 16:29.153
- I told you not to hog the
saran wrap!

16:29.155 --> 16:30.088
- I didn't see anything.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.055
- Look at yours, still on!

16:31.057 --> 16:32.390
- I didn't hog it,

16:32.392 --> 16:33.992
it, there just wasn't
enough to go around my...

16:33.994 --> 16:35.326
- bullshit, you were wrapping
your head

16:35.328 --> 16:36.794
like you were shippin'
it overseas!

16:36.796 --> 16:39.030
- I didn't see your face,
just take whatever you want.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.732
I don't care, I'm, I'm
just the house sitter.

16:40.734 --> 16:42.467
- Yes, you did see my face,
you were looking right at me!

16:42.469 --> 16:45.136
- I don't remember, just
vaguely Chinese, that's all.

16:45.138 --> 16:45.970
- Chinese?

16:45.972 --> 16:46.804
- Dude!

16:46.806 --> 16:48.539
- Turn around, Doug!

16:49.675 --> 16:49.674
- Whatever you're looking for,

16:49.676 --> 16:53.878
it's all in a secret
hiding spot, I know that.

16:53.880 --> 16:58.116
All the valuables, a computer,
uh, I don't, just everything.

16:59.587 --> 17:00.486
- Where?

17:00.487 --> 17:03.521
- I don't know, I just heard
them talking.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.089
- Ok, you stay here, let's go.

17:07.159 --> 17:08.859
- We should put her back
in the bed.

17:08.862 --> 17:09.694
- I'm fine.

17:09.695 --> 17:10.528
- She's fine!

17:10.530 --> 17:12.030
- No, come on, it's,

17:12.031 --> 17:13.531
we might be a while.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.098
- Really, I'm fine.

17:15.101 --> 17:16.768
- What's your name?

17:16.770 --> 17:17.635
- Darcy.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.037
- Darcy, there's really
no reason

17:19.039 --> 17:20.738
for you to be uncomfortable.

17:22.342 --> 17:23.674
Come on.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.742
- Jesus Christ!

17:30.482 --> 17:31.382
- Good?

17:31.384 --> 17:32.617
- Yeah.

17:32.619 --> 17:33.718
- Shout if you need anything.

17:33.720 --> 17:37.188
- But be fuckin' quiet
about it.

17:42.028 --> 17:43.895
What are you the concierge?

17:43.897 --> 17:46.431
- She saw my face, she can
identify me,

17:46.433 --> 17:48.366
so I want her to feel as
good as she possibly can

17:48.368 --> 17:50.068
about this whole experience.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.537
W-why are you calling me
by my middle name in there?

17:52.539 --> 17:54.172
You know how much I hate that.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.506
- What are you talking about?

17:55.508 --> 17:57.208
- You called me Doug!

17:57.210 --> 17:59.077
- I didn't know that was your
middle name.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.044
- Yes, you did.

18:00.046 --> 18:01.946
I told you that, wait.

18:26.106 --> 18:30.308
- Ok, now that I look at
it, I may have over-applied.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.314
- So, we have a hostage now.

18:38.517 --> 18:42.587
- Yeah, I know, it is not
ideal, her being here.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.923
- No, it's not ideal.

18:45.925 --> 18:48.559
- No, it is a problem,

18:48.561 --> 18:51.429
but she solves our
two other problems.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.296
- How?

18:52.298 --> 18:53.898
- She knows the code.

18:53.900 --> 18:53.898
- That's true.

18:53.900 --> 18:57.969
- And we know all the great
stuff is in a secret hiding spot

18:57.971 --> 19:00.872
we wouldn't be
looking for otherwise.

19:00.874 --> 19:03.407
So, all we have to do is find
the spot,

19:03.409 --> 19:07.645
steal the stuff, get the
code, and order our pizza.

19:10.282 --> 19:11.916
- We can do that.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.217
- Hell, yes, we can do that.

19:33.972 --> 19:35.006
- What are you doing?

19:35.008 --> 19:37.141
- There could be one of
those Scooby-doo deals,

19:37.143 --> 19:39.744
where the little thing,
you know.

19:58.630 --> 20:02.633
This is too much stuff!

20:02.635 --> 20:04.669
- Let's start over here.

20:29.928 --> 20:30.795
- Why in the hell would someone

20:30.797 --> 20:33.831
keep a box of blankets
in the garage?

20:33.833 --> 20:35.700
What's the practical
use in that?

20:35.702 --> 20:37.835
You're in bed, you're cold,

20:37.837 --> 20:41.005
you come out to the even
colder garage to get a blanket?

20:41.007 --> 20:41.005
- Eh, I don't know.

20:41.007 --> 20:45.309
- I know you don't know,
because you wouldn't do that,

20:45.311 --> 20:47.445
because it's a
stupid thing to do!

20:47.447 --> 20:50.548
That's the one percent
in action right there!

20:50.550 --> 20:54.051
This is why our country's
in the shitter!

20:57.991 --> 20:58.991
Hey, now!

21:00.626 --> 21:04.829
If that's not a secret
hidin' spot!

21:06.865 --> 21:08.032
- Oh, it's locked.

21:08.034 --> 21:11.569
- Exactly, because there's
valuable stuff in here.

21:11.571 --> 21:14.005
- Hey, whoa, no!

21:14.007 --> 21:14.005
- What?

21:14.007 --> 21:16.274
- You're gonna break
everything inside!

21:16.276 --> 21:17.608
- But it's locked!

21:17.610 --> 21:19.243
- So, we'll find the key.

21:19.245 --> 21:23.914
- But we just
found this!

21:23.916 --> 21:26.484
- Perfect, so we're on a roll.

21:34.126 --> 21:37.328
This house is just too damn
big, that's the real problem.

21:37.330 --> 21:37.328
- Yeah, if you're robbing it,

21:37.330 --> 21:40.665
but if you're living here,
it's probably pretty nice.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.600
- It's ostentatious!

21:42.602 --> 21:44.735
I mean, if they were just
a little more humble,

21:44.737 --> 21:47.305
we wouldn't have so many
rooms to look through.

21:47.307 --> 21:49.206
I mean, what is this?

21:49.208 --> 21:53.644
The fucking parlor room or
conservatory, it's like clue!

22:09.261 --> 22:11.228
- Niagara Falls.

22:11.230 --> 22:12.363
- Yeah.

22:12.365 --> 22:13.331
- Did you know Niagara Falls

22:13.333 --> 22:15.132
is actually three
different falls,

22:15.134 --> 22:16.934
horseshoe falls, bridal veil...

22:16.936 --> 22:19.036
- did you move anything here?

22:19.038 --> 22:20.137
- What?

22:20.139 --> 22:22.373
- Uh, was there any other stuff?

22:22.375 --> 22:24.608
- No, I just turned it on.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.878
- Well, did you
put it there, though,

22:27.880 --> 22:30.281
eh, in the center like that?

22:31.149 --> 22:32.950
- No, it was just there.

22:32.952 --> 22:34.285
- By itself?

22:34.287 --> 22:39.190
- Yeah, and then I turned
it on, what's your deal?

22:51.545 --> 22:52.804
- What are you doing?

22:52.805 --> 22:55.139
- I'm taking this, we haven't
found shit.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.074
This fits in my bag, it's
gotta be worth something.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.709
- It's just a lamp.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.711
- Yeah, but it's old and cool!

23:00.713 --> 23:03.080
You've seen those shows
where people find weird stuff

23:03.082 --> 23:04.882
and it turns out to be
worth a bundle.

23:04.884 --> 23:08.386
I saw this one where this
guy had an old spittoon,

23:08.388 --> 23:11.155
turned out to belong

23:11.157 --> 23:15.626
to some famous cowboy
or somethin', $100,000.

23:15.628 --> 23:16.961
- Cowboys didn't have lamps.

23:16.963 --> 23:18.362
- It doesn't have
to be a cowboy,

23:18.364 --> 23:19.697
that's not the important part.

23:19.699 --> 23:22.166
It's just that, generally, old
things are,

23:22.168 --> 23:24.335
you know, can be, uh, um.

23:25.537 --> 23:27.538
I don't know
all the specific rules,

23:27.540 --> 23:31.208
but this is old and
funky and you never know!

23:31.210 --> 23:32.610
- Uh, I do, ehm.

23:33.812 --> 23:36.380
I'm telling you, it's worth
a couple hundred bucks.

23:36.382 --> 23:38.682
Maybe three by now, maybe.

23:38.684 --> 23:40.384
- Well, we'll see.

23:40.386 --> 23:41.752
- It is.

23:41.754 --> 23:42.753
- You say.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.922
- I don't say, I know.

23:44.924 --> 23:45.924
- How?

23:55.467 --> 23:57.902
- Because I bought it.

23:57.904 --> 24:01.005
- You have one of these,
I haven't seen it.

24:01.007 --> 24:03.407
- No, this one, I bought it,

24:04.543 --> 24:07.044
and we can't take it.

24:13.118 --> 24:15.419
- Why would a lamp
that you bought

24:15.421 --> 24:18.222
be in a house
that we're robbing?

24:22.060 --> 24:23.794
Who's house is this?

24:26.765 --> 24:28.098
- Jessica's.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.100
- Oh,

24:29.868 --> 24:32.102
you have got to let it go!

24:40.912 --> 24:42.580
So, what,
you've been stalking her?

24:42.582 --> 24:43.614
- No!

24:43.616 --> 24:45.216
- But you know where she lives.

24:45.218 --> 24:47.117
- That's just Facebook.

24:47.119 --> 24:48.719
- You're still Facebook friends
with her?

24:49.589 --> 24:50.988
So you've just been
stalking her online?

24:50.990 --> 24:54.024
- That's not stalking,
that's what Facebook is for.

24:54.026 --> 24:56.894
- How did you
know where the key was?

24:56.896 --> 24:58.729
- We usedta'
live together,

24:58.731 --> 25:00.231
she loves the hide-a-rock.

25:00.233 --> 25:02.333
She, she used to
give it to everyone,

25:02.335 --> 25:05.803
every housewarming gift
ever was a hide-a-rock.

25:05.805 --> 25:10.307
She thinks it's the height
of human innovation.

25:10.309 --> 25:12.843
- So what exactly was
your plan here?

25:12.845 --> 25:15.045
- To rob the place.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.280
- Why?

25:16.282 --> 25:17.282
- Why?

25:18.183 --> 25:21.018
We've been talkin'
about it forever,

25:21.020 --> 25:22.486
so I found a good place!

25:22.488 --> 25:24.255
- No, you found a
terrible place!

25:24.257 --> 25:25.890
I wanted to rob someplace cool,

25:25.892 --> 25:29.693
not your ex-fiancee's new
fiance's house.

25:29.695 --> 25:32.196
- It's a good place.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.597
There's jewelry,

25:36.201 --> 25:37.635
diamonds.

25:37.637 --> 25:40.604
- Diamonds, she has diamonds?

25:40.606 --> 25:43.040
- A diamond, for sure.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.409
- Wait, are we just here to
steal back your engagement ring?

25:45.411 --> 25:46.410
- She shouldn't have kept it.

25:46.412 --> 25:47.645
- Holy shit!

25:47.647 --> 25:49.079
- She shouldn't have, and she
knows it!

25:49.081 --> 25:50.814
- Why didn't you just
ask for it back?

25:50.816 --> 25:52.683
- There was a lot goin' on!

25:52.685 --> 25:55.686
We both wanted the cuisinart,
we had a big argument

25:55.688 --> 25:58.322
about who put down
the security deposit.

25:58.324 --> 25:59.657
- You've gotta be
kidding me!

25:59.659 --> 26:02.092
- Neither of us even
thought about the ring,

26:02.094 --> 26:05.362
and then I did, and I thought,

26:05.364 --> 26:08.065
well, if I realize it,
then she realizes it,

26:08.067 --> 26:10.634
and she'll bring it back soon.

26:11.503 --> 26:14.438
And then she didn't,
and then I thought,

26:14.440 --> 26:16.640
well, maybe that
means something.

26:16.642 --> 26:18.842
Maybe she's not ready to let go,

26:22.380 --> 26:25.182
and then she got engaged,

26:26.985 --> 26:31.822
and then that was
the last straw.

26:34.326 --> 26:35.626
- This is the saddest heist

26:35.628 --> 26:37.361
in the long,
storied history of crime.

26:37.363 --> 26:39.563
- No, it's not,
it's the perfect crime!

26:39.565 --> 26:40.764
I get my ring back,

26:40.766 --> 26:43.067
you get to steal his
stupid rich guy's stuff.

26:43.069 --> 26:44.335
- Except that.

26:44.337 --> 26:46.503
- That's not his, that's
hers, I gave that to her.

26:46.505 --> 26:48.172
- Even better,
you get it back, too.

26:48.174 --> 26:51.208
- No, look, she kept it, here.

26:52.243 --> 26:54.845
In her house, with her fiancee,

26:54.847 --> 26:56.981
on a table all by itself.

26:57.782 --> 26:59.016
Don't you see?

27:00.385 --> 27:01.719
I'm still here!

27:03.054 --> 27:05.623
She's still has a thing for me.

27:05.625 --> 27:07.257
- She doesn't have a
thing for you,

27:07.259 --> 27:08.726
she has a thing for this thing.

27:08.728 --> 27:10.027
This thing is nice!

27:10.029 --> 27:11.029
- I'm nice!

27:11.796 --> 27:14.331
- She's engaged to another guy.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.433
- She can still change her mind.

27:16.435 --> 27:17.501
I know this.

27:18.770 --> 27:23.007
- So she kept your
ring, and she kept your lamp,

27:24.209 --> 27:26.410
so she's gonna get back together
with you?

27:26.412 --> 27:27.878
- Maybe.

27:27.880 --> 27:28.880
- Maybe?

27:31.182 --> 27:32.883
What about the girl up there?

27:32.885 --> 27:34.084
- Who?

27:34.086 --> 27:37.788
- The girl we just taped
up, the house sitter!

27:37.790 --> 27:39.256
- I don't know, what about her?

27:39.258 --> 27:43.227
- She's a friend and she's seen
your face.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.829
So, you and Jessica are
gonna get back together

27:45.831 --> 27:47.965
and you're gonna run into
her and she's gonna be like,

27:47.967 --> 27:49.533
"oh, do you know Leo?"

27:49.535 --> 27:53.771
"Oh, yeah, he tied me up in
your bedroom that one time!"

27:55.540 --> 27:57.574
- Guys?

27:57.576 --> 27:59.877
- She's not the quiet type.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.212
- Hey, guys?

28:02.214 --> 28:05.282
- Come on!

28:06.785 --> 28:07.785
- Guys!

28:08.586 --> 28:09.987
- That's not
quiet shouting,

28:09.989 --> 28:12.423
that's regular, loud shouting.

28:12.425 --> 28:14.458
- Sorry, I really
have to go to the bathroom.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.762
- Would you stop it?

28:18.764 --> 28:21.098
- Does it look ok?

28:21.100 --> 28:22.366
- It's fine.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.068
- Ok.

28:24.070 --> 28:25.736
- She has to go to the bathroom.

28:25.738 --> 28:26.570
- How bad?

28:26.572 --> 28:27.838
- Pretty bad.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.674
- Ok, let's, um,
let's tear a little hole

28:30.676 --> 28:32.810
in the sheet around her, uh...

28:32.812 --> 28:35.245
- I'm not doing
that, that's super rapey!

28:35.247 --> 28:39.550
- That's not rapey, it's,
we're being courteous!

28:39.552 --> 28:42.152
Ok, you have to go
to the bathroom?

28:42.154 --> 28:43.954
That's no one's fault.

28:43.956 --> 28:46.957
We appreciate that you,
uh, didn't soil the bed.

28:46.959 --> 28:49.226
That shows a lot of respect.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.428
Not towards us, specifically,
but just, you know,

28:51.430 --> 28:55.666
general respect towards
humankind and,
uh, societal norms.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.738
So that's a good trust-building
move, am I right?

29:00.740 --> 29:00.738
- Sure.

29:00.740 --> 29:05.476
- Ok, so, you showed
some respect,

29:05.977 --> 29:09.747
we will do likewise and un-tape
you, ok?

29:09.749 --> 29:09.747
- Yes, please.

29:09.749 --> 29:14.351
- But just to go to the
bathroom, that's it.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.520
So you can tend to your needs.

29:16.522 --> 29:19.523
Then, we'll tape you back up.

29:19.525 --> 29:20.824
- I understand.

29:22.060 --> 29:23.627
- Ok, Doug, let's.

29:31.837 --> 29:34.071
Oh, it's tearing the sheet a
little here.

29:34.073 --> 29:37.174
- See, the sheets were my idea.

29:37.176 --> 29:40.043
Didn't wanna tear up your skin.

29:40.045 --> 29:41.078
- Thank you.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.412
- Oh, it was nothing.

29:42.414 --> 29:44.615
Anyone would've, I mean,
he didn't.

29:44.617 --> 29:45.449
- Hey!

29:45.451 --> 29:47.551
- But really, anyone.

29:47.553 --> 29:48.352
- Whoa!

29:48.354 --> 29:49.186
- What?

29:49.188 --> 29:49.186
- I'm not dressed!

29:49.188 --> 29:52.422
- Well, you're not undressed,
you're wearin' underwear.

29:52.424 --> 29:53.590
- Well, still, that's not the...

29:53.592 --> 29:55.759
- we've already
seen you.

29:55.761 --> 29:58.529
- Well, I'd prefer that
you did not see me again!

29:58.531 --> 29:59.830
- I don't know if this helps,

29:59.832 --> 30:03.066
but you really shouldn't
have any body shame.

30:03.068 --> 30:03.066
- What?

30:03.068 --> 30:07.171
- I-I'm just saying, you're
overall fitness seems high.

30:07.173 --> 30:10.040
Whatever work you're doing
is really paying off.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.875
You should be super proud of
the, uh...

30:11.877 --> 30:13.310
- Ok!
- Results.

30:13.312 --> 30:14.711
- That's enough.

30:15.947 --> 30:18.315
You're in your underwear, you
have to go to the bathroom.

30:18.317 --> 30:21.351
Those are just two facts, deal
with 'em!

30:21.353 --> 30:23.987
We don't care,
we're not perverts.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.622
We're thieves, ok?

30:25.624 --> 30:27.024
No, let's go!

30:37.502 --> 30:40.170
There's a window, so, uh,
we're going in with you.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.004
- Why?

30:41.006 --> 30:42.439
- So you don't
run away.

30:42.441 --> 30:44.274
- I'm not gonna run away,
I'm in my underwear!

30:44.276 --> 30:47.010
- Who cares, Cindy birdsong
jumped out of a moving vehicle

30:47.012 --> 30:49.513
on the long beach
freeway to avoid capture.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.048
A little panty dash is nothin'.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.182
- Who is Cindy birdsong?

30:52.184 --> 30:53.450
- One of the supremes.

30:53.452 --> 30:53.450
- Why do you know that?

30:53.452 --> 30:58.222
- 'Cause I'm an educated person,
come on!

30:58.224 --> 31:00.357
- What, both of you?

31:00.359 --> 31:01.959
- Fine, I'll go.

31:01.961 --> 31:04.394
- Ok, because I have to go
number two.

31:04.396 --> 31:07.264
- Fine, we'll flip
for it.

31:07.266 --> 31:08.266
- Heads.

31:18.310 --> 31:19.310
- Hey, um,

31:21.946 --> 31:25.649
you can have a little
bit of dignity anyhow.

31:31.222 --> 31:34.625
Let's see, what else?

31:34.627 --> 31:34.625
That'll help a little,

31:34.627 --> 31:37.861
but you gotta give me
the mercy flush.

31:37.863 --> 31:37.861
- What?

31:37.863 --> 31:41.765
- Just, well, as soon as it,
you know,

31:41.767 --> 31:45.569
hits the water, just
get rid of it, flush it.

31:45.571 --> 31:49.339
Now is now the time
for water conservation.

31:49.341 --> 31:49.339
- Ok.

31:49.341 --> 31:54.411
- Let's see, she normally
has a lavender,

31:56.014 --> 31:58.649
people have lavender spray, so.

32:01.085 --> 32:03.820
You do that, and I'll use these,

32:06.357 --> 32:11.128
and that'll, uh, mask any of,

32:11.130 --> 32:14.031
uh, maybe turn on the shower.

32:14.033 --> 32:14.998
- Why?

32:15.000 --> 32:17.567
- Just to cover up any noises.

32:22.707 --> 32:25.676
Ok, good.

32:25.678 --> 32:27.244
Uh, do you feel good?

32:27.246 --> 32:28.178
- Uh, yeah.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.579
- Good, um, uhn,

32:32.350 --> 32:33.984
get to it, I guess.

32:40.925 --> 32:44.061
My name's not Doug,
just so you know.

32:46.030 --> 32:47.798
Doesn't matter what
my real name is,

32:47.800 --> 32:49.800
I just don't like Doug.

32:51.035 --> 32:54.404
Don't want you thinkin'
of me as a Doug.

32:57.342 --> 33:00.911
We actually probably have stuff
in common.

33:04.349 --> 33:07.851
Friends, maybe, even, like, the
point is,

33:09.487 --> 33:13.724
it's a small world, that's all
I'm sayin'.

33:16.627 --> 33:19.162
Hey, the system's workin'
well, though, isn't it?

33:19.164 --> 33:21.765
I haven't, I wouldn't even know
that yeh!

33:24.737 --> 33:27.404
- You guys ok in there?

33:27.406 --> 33:29.406
- Marlon, Marlon!

33:31.409 --> 33:32.476
- Stay there!

33:32.478 --> 33:33.310
- Don't hurt him!

33:33.312 --> 33:34.511
- You fuckers are letting me go!

33:34.513 --> 33:36.213
- Ok, yes, just stay calm!

33:36.215 --> 33:39.449
- I am calm, I will calmly
choke your friend to death!

33:39.451 --> 33:41.084
- No, no, no, don't,
don't, don't, look, look!

33:41.086 --> 33:43.653
He's fading, he's just, just let
us out,

33:43.655 --> 33:46.156
and we'll go away, it'll be
like this never happened!

33:46.158 --> 33:47.557
- Ok, all right, just let me go!

33:47.559 --> 33:49.292
- Ok, yes, just let us out!

33:49.294 --> 33:50.927
- Ok!

33:50.929 --> 33:52.029
Wait, what, let you out?

33:52.031 --> 33:52.029
What are you talking about?

33:52.031 --> 33:55.699
- The alarm, just let us out
and we'll be fuckin' gone!

33:55.701 --> 33:56.733
- The alarm's off!

33:56.735 --> 33:59.236
- No, we armed it,
it was an accident,

33:59.238 --> 34:01.538
so just type in the
code, and we'll be gone

34:01.540 --> 34:03.373
and that's that, I swear!

34:07.279 --> 34:10.679
- I saw, I saw clouds,
people made of clouds,

34:10.681 --> 34:11.848
and they were goin'...

34:11.850 --> 34:13.516
- it's ok, it's ok,
you're all right.

34:13.518 --> 34:16.553
You're all right, we're
gettin' out of here.

34:16.554 --> 34:17.754
- You armed it?

34:17.755 --> 34:19.822
- I was establishing a pattern.

34:22.761 --> 34:23.893
What's wrong?

34:25.029 --> 34:27.130
- I don't know the code.

34:27.132 --> 34:28.132
- Why not?

34:30.635 --> 34:32.936
- I'm not the house sitter.

34:37.574 --> 34:40.010
- Why would a pet need a taxi?

34:40.012 --> 34:41.110
- It's a thing, ok?

34:41.112 --> 34:42.679
People wanna get their
dogs to the groomers

34:42.681 --> 34:45.815
or off to the kennel before they
go away.

34:45.818 --> 34:47.117
- One-percenters, man.

34:47.119 --> 34:49.619
- Yeah, they will throw
down for their pets.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.855
It's crazy, I don't mean
that like a figure of speech,

34:51.857 --> 34:53.889
I mean like!

34:53.891 --> 34:57.160
I've seen a dog with a
collar that cost 500 bucks.

34:57.162 --> 34:58.462
Can you believe that shit?

34:58.464 --> 35:01.031
500 American for a dog collar!

35:02.567 --> 35:04.901
- So you pick up the dog
and take it to the kennel,

35:04.903 --> 35:06.937
why would they give you a key?

35:06.939 --> 35:08.371
- They didn't.

35:08.373 --> 35:09.706
- Hide-a-rock?

35:09.708 --> 35:10.707
- What?

35:10.709 --> 35:12.175
- How did you get in?

35:12.177 --> 35:13.910
- I picked the lock.

35:15.913 --> 35:16.913
You ok?

35:18.182 --> 35:21.485
- Sorry, it's just, that's
really cool.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.623
What's your deal?

35:28.226 --> 35:29.593
- She has a dog?

35:31.062 --> 35:34.264
I always wanted a dog,
but she wouldn't let us.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.732
Now, fucking dog?

35:37.502 --> 35:40.170
- Wait, do you guys know
these people?

35:40.172 --> 35:41.104
- His ex-fiancee.

35:41.106 --> 35:41.104
- Shut up!

35:41.106 --> 35:46.176
- That is crazier
than a $500 dog collar!

35:47.912 --> 35:49.913
- No, it's not, I'm just here

35:49.915 --> 35:52.215
to get back my engagement ring.

35:52.217 --> 35:54.818
- Wait, she kept the ring?

35:54.820 --> 35:55.785
What a cunt!

35:55.787 --> 35:58.989
- Hey, whoa, no,
she is not a cunt!

35:58.991 --> 35:59.956
- Are you sure about that,

35:59.958 --> 36:01.391
because that's a straight-up
cunt move.

36:01.393 --> 36:02.792
- Yes, I'm sure.

36:04.362 --> 36:05.428
Pretty sure.

36:06.230 --> 36:07.764
- Wait, so don't take this the
wrong way,

36:07.766 --> 36:07.764
but I'm not really getting

36:07.766 --> 36:11.601
a master cat burglar vibe from
you guys.

36:11.603 --> 36:13.336
- You don't know us!

36:13.338 --> 36:16.973
- I know that you turned on
the security system somehow.

36:16.975 --> 36:19.543
- I was establishing a pattern.

36:19.545 --> 36:22.012
How did you know it wasn't
armed in the first place, huh?

36:22.014 --> 36:25.515
Did you just waltz in, pick
the lock, that's reckless!

36:25.517 --> 36:27.551
- Because I saw them not arm it!

36:27.553 --> 36:30.353
I came to pick up the dog,
they were hustling about,

36:30.355 --> 36:32.889
he was like, "uh, do you need
to put anything in the spot?"

36:32.891 --> 36:35.058
And she was like, "um, my
laptop," and then he was like,

36:35.060 --> 36:37.594
"uh, it's already in
there," and then they left,

36:37.596 --> 36:42.566
locked the door, no alarm,
it's somethin' I look for.

36:42.568 --> 36:44.067
- Something you look for?

36:44.069 --> 36:45.101
- Yeah.

36:45.103 --> 36:46.603
- Why?

36:46.605 --> 36:48.071
- So I don't get arrested.

36:48.073 --> 36:50.807
- Wait, this is, like, a thing
you do?

36:50.809 --> 36:53.210
- Yeah, I mean, they're gone.

36:53.212 --> 36:57.380
My apartment's a dump, and
they've got laundry and hbo.

36:57.382 --> 37:00.850
It's like a fucking
resort in these places!

37:00.852 --> 37:01.852
Relaxing.

37:07.191 --> 37:09.326
Until now.

37:09.328 --> 37:11.494
Now, it's all stressful.

37:11.496 --> 37:12.996
Now I need a drink.

37:12.998 --> 37:14.431
- Where are you going?

37:14.433 --> 37:14.431
- Wine!

37:14.433 --> 37:16.900
- Wait, uh, we need
to figure out

37:16.902 --> 37:16.900
how we're going to
get out of here.

37:16.902 --> 37:20.103
- Ok, they're not gonna be
home for a couple of days.

37:20.105 --> 37:23.640
I believe I have time for a
glass of wine.

37:27.745 --> 37:29.512
- In the old days,
that alarm code

37:29.514 --> 37:32.082
would've been our anniversary.

37:32.950 --> 37:34.884
- You guys had an alarm
in that shitty apartment?

37:34.886 --> 37:38.388
- God, no, but she used our
anniversary for everything.

37:38.390 --> 37:41.858
It was her pin number,
her bank password.

37:42.960 --> 37:45.729
If we hadn't broken up, I
could've gotten us out of here.

37:45.731 --> 37:48.064
- If you hadn't broken
up, we wouldn't be here.

37:48.066 --> 37:49.866
- Even better.

37:49.868 --> 37:54.371
It's like she's still
finding new ways to hurt me.

37:54.373 --> 37:55.972
- What are you looking for?

37:55.974 --> 37:58.575
- The dusty ones, they've been
keeping those the longest,

37:58.577 --> 38:00.577
so that means they're good.

38:00.579 --> 38:02.612
Then you just pack
out the bottle,

38:02.614 --> 38:04.547
they assume that they drank it
and forgot.

38:04.549 --> 38:06.249
I mean, that's the
beauty of booze.

38:06.251 --> 38:08.418
It makes things fuzzy.

38:10.355 --> 38:11.187
What'd you get?

38:11.189 --> 38:12.289
- Zinfandel.

38:12.291 --> 38:15.625
- Ah, primativo, that's its
other name.

38:17.361 --> 38:18.995
You learn.

38:18.997 --> 38:20.597
- Sangee-oh-vice.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.999
- Sangiovese, blood of jove,

38:24.168 --> 38:26.703
it's the only grape named after
a god.

38:26.705 --> 38:29.673
- That's good.

38:29.675 --> 38:33.910
- Come on, let us go be gods!

38:35.780 --> 38:37.314
- Hmm!

38:40.385 --> 38:43.520
I stole money from the
collection plate at church.

38:43.522 --> 38:45.722
- I told a guy that
I was pregnant

38:45.724 --> 38:48.491
and let him believe
it for three days.

38:48.493 --> 38:50.460
- I kissed my step-mom.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.330
She was asleep.

38:53.332 --> 38:55.198
- Did she wake up?

38:55.200 --> 38:56.099
- Yeah.

38:56.101 --> 38:58.601
- Ok, you win.

38:58.603 --> 38:59.436
- Do I, though?

38:59.438 --> 39:01.137
- No.

39:03.075 --> 39:04.140
Hey-hey-hey!

39:05.976 --> 39:07.877
Mm, mm, this is tasty?

39:09.680 --> 39:10.547
- Which?

39:10.549 --> 39:13.216
- Uh, le poof le puff,
the, uh French.

39:17.255 --> 39:19.089
Oh, uh, sorry, what's your name?

39:19.091 --> 39:19.089
- Marlon.

39:19.091 --> 39:22.792
- Marlon,
it's the other one.

39:22.794 --> 39:24.160
Wait, Marlon?

39:24.162 --> 39:24.994
- Yeah.

39:24.996 --> 39:25.862
- Like the fish?

39:25.864 --> 39:27.797
- No, like Marlon Brando.

39:27.799 --> 39:31.634
- Oh, it's funny, I never
think of the fish with him.

39:31.636 --> 39:36.239
I guess because it's never just
Marlon, it's Marlon Brando.

39:36.241 --> 39:37.474
What's your last name?

39:37.476 --> 39:38.308
- It's, uh...

39:38.310 --> 39:39.909
- don't tell her your last name,

39:39.911 --> 39:42.045
you shouldn't have told
her your first name!

39:42.047 --> 39:43.179
- I told you mine.

39:43.181 --> 39:44.147
- Did you?

39:44.149 --> 39:45.281
- Yes, it's Darcy.

39:45.283 --> 39:46.349
- Is it?

39:46.351 --> 39:47.917
- The fuck, dude, yes!

39:47.919 --> 39:49.185
Why would I lie about that?

39:49.187 --> 39:50.053
- 'Cause you're a liar,

39:50.055 --> 39:51.755
because you break into
people's houses.

39:51.757 --> 39:53.923
That's not trustworthy behavior.

39:53.925 --> 39:55.191
- You guys broke in.

39:55.193 --> 39:57.093
- No, we used the key.

39:58.028 --> 39:59.229
- You're robbing the place.

39:59.231 --> 40:02.031
- Not yet, we haven't taken
anything yet.

40:02.033 --> 40:04.934
- Clearly, you intend to,
you're gonna take that lamp.

40:04.936 --> 40:07.003
You've been carrying it around
with you from room to room.

40:07.005 --> 40:07.971
It's as good as gone!

40:07.973 --> 40:09.739
- No, we're not taking it.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.574
I'm carrying it around to
keep him from taking it,

40:11.576 --> 40:14.944
so that just goes to show what
you know.

40:17.848 --> 40:19.282
- Did you know Niagara Falls is
actually

40:19.284 --> 40:21.584
three separate falls,
bridal veil...

40:21.586 --> 40:23.620
- stop it, Jesus!

40:23.622 --> 40:27.490
You lug around all this
useless trivia, and for what?

40:27.492 --> 40:31.227
- Hold on, at least I
know real stuff!

40:31.229 --> 40:32.762
You're the world's
leading expert in a woman

40:32.764 --> 40:34.664
that doesn't even
love you anymore!

40:34.666 --> 40:36.800
So, when are you gonna
put that to good use?

40:36.802 --> 40:38.401
- When we're back together.

40:42.406 --> 40:44.274
- It's a, it's a cool lamp,
though.

40:47.546 --> 40:49.846
- Yeah, have you ever been?

40:51.682 --> 40:53.082
- Niagara Falls?

40:54.685 --> 40:59.522
- It's a lot of water, an
impossible amount of water.

40:59.524 --> 41:00.924
It's inevitable.

41:02.493 --> 41:07.263
It just keeps coming
and coming,

41:07.265 --> 41:08.998
and the noise, it's,

41:12.203 --> 41:14.170
you don't even hear it.

41:15.339 --> 41:18.475
It's not like something
else anymore,

41:19.810 --> 41:21.177
it's just,

41:25.083 --> 41:27.584
it's the only thing there is.

41:32.056 --> 41:36.292
It's terrifying.

41:39.930 --> 41:42.632
And then someone holds your hand

41:45.336 --> 41:46.402
and her skin

41:48.205 --> 41:49.272
and the air,

41:51.308 --> 41:55.478
and this noise.

41:57.281 --> 42:00.517
It's everything, you know,
everything.

42:03.387 --> 42:06.022
You've got it all in your hand.

42:13.664 --> 42:16.299
It's the happiest we ever were,

42:18.235 --> 42:21.704
and she's kept me here with her,
you see?

42:24.742 --> 42:26.075
So I'm staying.

42:29.446 --> 42:31.147
The lamp stays.

42:42.793 --> 42:45.428
I'm going to look for that key.

42:53.104 --> 42:56.839
- So, uh, your folks, Marlon
Brando fans?

42:56.841 --> 42:58.308
- Marlon Jackson,

42:59.843 --> 43:01.077
the Jackson 5.

43:02.846 --> 43:04.414
- That's, uh, not,

43:05.716 --> 43:08.451
Michael, Jermaine, tito, Jackie.

43:10.387 --> 43:13.723
Michael, Jermaine, tito, Jackie.

43:13.725 --> 43:16.225
- Marlon.

43:16.227 --> 43:17.227
- Marlon.

43:19.563 --> 43:23.466
You should never tell
anybody that ever again.

45:00.364 --> 45:02.732
- Oh, I was just trying it on.

45:02.734 --> 45:03.966
- What?

45:03.968 --> 45:06.035
- It's nice, I was just.

45:07.171 --> 45:08.738
- Is it Jessica's?

45:10.074 --> 45:12.875
I don't care,
you should take it.

45:13.877 --> 45:15.445
Looks nice on you.

45:19.650 --> 45:21.651
- Did you find anything?

45:21.653 --> 45:22.653
- No.

45:24.321 --> 45:28.157
I just thought, five
years we were together,

45:28.159 --> 45:31.160
maybe there'd be one
picture of me.

45:32.296 --> 45:34.030
- Well, maybe he's the
jealous type.

45:34.032 --> 45:35.598
I mean, dudes don't
really wanna see photos

45:35.600 --> 45:38.134
of ex-boyfriend's lying around.

45:38.136 --> 45:39.469
- Ex-fiancee.

45:39.471 --> 45:40.603
- Even worse!

45:43.240 --> 45:44.407
She's pretty.

45:45.943 --> 45:49.345
Look at this guy!

45:49.347 --> 45:51.547
His face is too big
for his head.

45:51.549 --> 45:53.883
So yeah, he definitely

45:53.885 --> 45:58.387
doesn't wanna see photos
of you.

45:58.389 --> 46:02.525
That's the kind of guy
who names his dog fido.

46:02.527 --> 46:03.526
- What?

46:03.528 --> 46:06.295
- Yeah, they named
their dog fido, no shit.

46:06.297 --> 46:08.464
Like straight out of a
comic book or something.

46:08.466 --> 46:10.433
- That wh, was my name!

46:11.702 --> 46:13.803
- Wait, so it's not Doug, it's...

46:13.805 --> 46:15.138
- that's what I was gonna name
our dog

46:15.140 --> 46:15.138
she wouldn't let us get!

46:15.140 --> 46:18.407
I always told her,
"wouldn't that be funny?"

46:18.409 --> 46:21.277
It's like, everyone thinks
of that as a dog's name,

46:21.279 --> 46:23.846
but no one actually names their
dog that.

46:23.848 --> 46:25.181
Here, fido!

46:25.183 --> 46:27.416
It'd be fuckin' hilarious!

46:30.053 --> 46:32.955
- It'd be a unique cliche,

46:32.957 --> 46:34.290
in canine form.

46:35.659 --> 46:37.226
- See, you get it.

47:02.386 --> 47:04.253
- Hello, beautiful!

47:04.255 --> 47:06.589
- That motherfucker's
got a dog named fido,

47:06.591 --> 47:08.157
and he doesn't even know why!

47:08.159 --> 47:08.157
- Dumb shit!

47:08.159 --> 47:11.527
- Yeah, oh, maybe you don't
have any pictures of me

47:11.529 --> 47:14.697
in your house, but you're
runnin' around sayin',

47:14.699 --> 47:16.465
"mm, here, fido, come, fido!"

47:16.467 --> 47:20.236
Might as well be balls
deep in your old lady, man!

47:20.238 --> 47:22.004
- He's your cuckold!

47:22.006 --> 47:23.406
- What's that?

47:23.408 --> 47:25.441
- It's where one guy watches the
other guy

47:25.443 --> 47:28.477
have sex with his girl
and likes it.

47:28.479 --> 47:29.512
- That's a thing?

47:29.514 --> 47:30.813
- Yeah.

47:30.815 --> 47:33.850
Mm, don't judge, it's too easy.

47:34.484 --> 47:37.653
You know, you find something
that makes you feel good,

47:37.655 --> 47:39.655
that's hard to come by.

47:41.925 --> 47:45.228
- When you,
you choked me...

47:45.230 --> 47:46.796
- yeah, I'm sorry about that,
that...

47:46.798 --> 47:51.033
- it's, it's ok, I just, I'm
,

47:54.404 --> 47:56.372
right at the end there,

47:57.474 --> 48:00.543
just as I was starting
to black out,

48:04.047 --> 48:08.284
it was the most euphoric thing
I've ever felt in my life.

48:43.253 --> 48:44.253
- Does that mean stop?

48:46.357 --> 48:47.357
Was it ok?

48:48.725 --> 48:51.694
- It was amazing.

48:51.696 --> 48:54.997
- I wanna try.

48:54.999 --> 48:55.831
- Are you sure?

48:55.833 --> 48:57.099
- Yeah, definitely.

48:57.101 --> 49:01.237
- Uh, well, maybe
we should have a safe word,

49:01.239 --> 49:03.873
you know, like when you want me
to stop,

49:03.875 --> 49:06.909
you say rutabaga or whatever.

49:06.911 --> 49:10.179
- How am I gonna say rutabaga
if you're choking me?

49:10.181 --> 49:12.114
- Rooabegguh.

49:12.116 --> 49:13.215
- How 'bout I just
squeeze your wrist

49:13.217 --> 49:15.284
really quick, like this?

49:20.158 --> 49:21.657
- Kay, you ready?

49:22.559 --> 49:24.961
- I have hbo.

49:24.963 --> 49:25.963
- What?

49:28.198 --> 49:32.435
- At my apartment,
I have hbo and laundry.

49:36.807 --> 49:37.807
- Ok.

49:39.109 --> 49:40.109
- Ok.

51:20.243 --> 51:21.944
- Good morning.

51:21.946 --> 51:22.946
- Hey.

51:24.581 --> 51:26.415
- That was quite a thing, huh?

51:26.417 --> 51:28.017
- Uh, thing?

51:28.019 --> 51:30.419
- Uh, I just mean, you know.

51:31.254 --> 51:33.189
- What, I don't know,
what's a thing?

51:33.191 --> 51:35.891
- Uh, a night,
I guess.

51:35.893 --> 51:39.628
- Oh, yeah, definitely
was a night, ok, yep.

51:41.698 --> 51:43.032
- What are you,
what are you doing?

51:43.034 --> 51:45.935
- I'm just trying to,
there we go.

51:46.736 --> 51:50.473
Get my underwear.

51:50.475 --> 51:52.274
- Did I...

51:52.276 --> 51:53.342
- hmm?

51:54.311 --> 51:55.578
- Is something wrong?

51:55.580 --> 51:58.914
- Um, I just,

52:00.750 --> 52:04.987
I, I shouldn'ta
done that.

52:05.956 --> 52:09.358
- It's ok, it's ok, I mean,
things got kinda wild, but...

52:09.360 --> 52:10.926
- no, it's not ok.

52:11.761 --> 52:13.996
Um, this is Jessica's bed,

52:17.200 --> 52:20.069
and I shouldn't be having sex

52:20.071 --> 52:22.705
with someone else in
Jessica's bed.

52:22.707 --> 52:27.643
- Well, I mean, she has sex
with someone else in this bed.

52:27.645 --> 52:29.845
- Don't make it gross!

52:29.847 --> 52:33.182
This, it was disrespectful,

52:33.984 --> 52:37.686
and I shouldn't have done that
to her.

52:37.688 --> 52:39.155
- I don't mean to nitpick here,

52:39.157 --> 52:41.423
but you didn't do anything
to her.

52:41.425 --> 52:43.959
You did a lot of things to me.

52:45.061 --> 52:46.061
- Uh, oh.

52:46.939 --> 52:48.198
- What are you doing?

52:48.199 --> 52:50.933
- Uh, we need to wash
these sheets.

52:50.935 --> 52:52.368
- Oh, Jesus!

52:52.370 --> 52:54.036
- What, that's just
common courtesy.

52:54.038 --> 52:56.038
- No, you just fucked
me six ways to Sunday!

52:56.040 --> 52:59.341
Common courtesy is to
buy me breakfast!

53:00.243 --> 53:04.213
- I'm sorry, I-i didn't mean to
fuck you.

53:04.215 --> 53:05.714
It was an accident.

53:05.716 --> 53:09.552
- Well, that was
a long, drawn-out accident!

53:09.554 --> 53:10.786
- Yeah, sorry.

53:25.302 --> 53:26.902
You found the computer.

53:26.904 --> 53:28.270
- I did.

53:28.272 --> 53:30.372
- Why are you wearing a robe?

53:30.374 --> 53:33.609
- Because Jessica's fiancee
has terrible toilet aim.

53:33.611 --> 53:36.478
I can't find the code,
by the way.

53:36.480 --> 53:40.416
I'm looking for hours,
found a lot of other stuff,

53:40.418 --> 53:41.984
but no alarm code.

53:43.920 --> 53:45.421
Whatta you been up to?

53:45.423 --> 53:48.657
- Um, fell asleep, the wine,
you know.

53:49.492 --> 53:51.660
I-is this all the jewelry
you found?

53:51.662 --> 53:54.330
- Why, do you wanna add it
to the jewelry you found?

53:54.332 --> 53:57.733
- No, it's just, uh, my ring's
not here.

53:59.236 --> 54:01.503
- Maybe she got rid of it.

54:01.505 --> 54:03.205
- What's that mean?

54:03.207 --> 54:05.608
- You know, sold it,
gave it away.

54:05.610 --> 54:07.076
Threw it in the ocean.

54:07.078 --> 54:08.377
- Wh-wh-why-wh,

54:11.715 --> 54:12.781
what's this?

54:14.551 --> 54:15.718
- Diary.

54:15.720 --> 54:16.986
- Jessica's?

54:16.988 --> 54:17.988
- Yeah.

54:18.989 --> 54:21.056
- How do you know,
did you read it?

54:21.058 --> 54:23.559
- I'm looking for the code.

54:24.496 --> 54:25.395
Morning.

54:25.396 --> 54:28.831
- Morning, anyone
want breakfast?

54:28.833 --> 54:29.833
I'm buying!

54:32.936 --> 54:35.604
- I'm not in here at, at all!

54:35.606 --> 54:37.740
- I noticed that.

54:37.742 --> 54:39.642
- I mean, I didn't expect
to be on every page,

54:39.644 --> 54:42.778
but maybe one mention
would be nice, you know.

54:42.780 --> 54:45.014
"I thought of Leo today
in passing,

54:45.016 --> 54:48.284
"he's a person that I remember."

54:48.286 --> 54:53.022
- Yep, some people just
aren't much for history.

54:53.024 --> 54:56.091
- Hold on, there's gotta be at
least one.

55:00.697 --> 55:02.798
- You looked stressed, you
want some tomato juice?

55:02.800 --> 55:05.200
- Yeah, did I tell you that?

55:05.969 --> 55:07.102
- Tell me what?

55:07.104 --> 55:09.738
- That tomato juice
calms me down.

55:09.740 --> 55:11.040
- Come on, man!

55:13.511 --> 55:14.511
Oh, 11:11!

55:21.985 --> 55:24.653
- $104,900,
that's what we're up to.

55:24.655 --> 55:28.490
It's been 525 days since our
last winner,

55:28.492 --> 55:30.592
twice a day, every day,
at 11:11,

55:30.594 --> 55:33.028
we pose the impossible question!

55:33.030 --> 55:35.331
And the good, kind folks
as black bear markets

55:35.333 --> 55:36.498
add another hundred dollars

55:36.500 --> 55:37.966
to the kitty.
- Shh!

55:37.968 --> 55:39.601
- Call with
the answer within 22 seconds

55:39.603 --> 55:42.304
and that kitty's all yours.

55:42.306 --> 55:43.872
It's so simple

55:43.874 --> 55:47.176
if it weren't impossible,
so phones at the ready.

55:47.178 --> 55:51.647
Here it comes, other
than Elvis Presley, who...

55:52.883 --> 55:54.683
- turn it off!

55:54.685 --> 55:56.218
Turn it off, turn it off!

55:56.220 --> 55:57.486
- What the fuck!

55:57.488 --> 55:58.487
- One
calendar year?

55:58.489 --> 56:00.122
- The fuck is wrong
with you people?

56:00.124 --> 56:00.956
- 10
seconds left.

56:00.958 --> 56:01.790
- Shh!

56:01.792 --> 56:01.790
- God!

56:01.792 --> 56:01.790
Other than Elvis Presley,

56:01.792 --> 56:05.461
who outlived his twin
brother at childbirth

56:05.463 --> 56:07.629
and went on to have
four number one singles

56:07.631 --> 56:09.064
in one calendar year?

56:09.066 --> 56:12.301
- Marlon Jackson,
it's Marlon Jackson!

56:14.304 --> 56:15.437
It's ringing!

56:17.040 --> 56:18.307
- And time
is up!

56:18.309 --> 56:21.043
- Fuck!

56:21.045 --> 56:23.178
- The
answer, Marlon Jackson

56:23.180 --> 56:24.613
of the Jackson 5!

56:24.615 --> 56:26.882
- Oh, shit!

56:26.884 --> 56:28.150
Brandon died at childbirth,

56:28.152 --> 56:32.254
and the Jackson 5 had four
number one hits in 1970.

56:32.256 --> 56:33.555
I want you back,

56:33.557 --> 56:37.459
abc, the love you save, and I'll
be there.

56:40.798 --> 56:42.698
- They're coming home.

56:47.404 --> 56:48.971
- Where are they now?

56:48.973 --> 56:50.839
- I don't know, she
posted this an hour ago.

56:50.841 --> 56:54.143
Headed home early, I wonder
what happened?

56:54.145 --> 56:54.143
- Who cares!

56:54.145 --> 56:57.613
- Why are you creeping on
her Facebook like that?

56:57.615 --> 57:01.550
- I am not cree, that's
irrelevant to the situation, ok?

57:01.552 --> 57:04.186
They're coming home, here, now!

57:04.188 --> 57:05.587
- Where were they?

57:05.589 --> 57:06.422
- I don't know.

57:06.424 --> 57:07.589
- Hawaii.

57:07.591 --> 57:07.589
- Creeper!

57:07.591 --> 57:10.692
- Don't ke, all right.

57:10.694 --> 57:13.962
You're the creeper, always
breakin' into houses,

57:13.964 --> 57:17.599
tryin' on people's lives
'cause you don't like your own.

57:17.601 --> 57:19.168
- My life is fine.

57:20.136 --> 57:22.538
I just do it for the thrill.

57:23.506 --> 57:26.375
- Well, I had a real life once

57:26.377 --> 57:29.411
and it was pretty
fuckin' thrilling.

57:31.514 --> 57:32.514
- Ok, look.

57:33.616 --> 57:35.451
Hawaii is a long flight.

57:35.453 --> 57:38.854
They have to get their
baggage, there's the cab ride.

57:38.856 --> 57:40.689
We've got some time.

57:40.691 --> 57:42.891
- To do what, we either get
caught by her,

57:42.893 --> 57:45.394
or we trip the alarm and
get caught by the cops!

57:45.396 --> 57:46.795
- I choose the cops.

57:46.797 --> 57:47.830
- Are you serious?

57:47.832 --> 57:49.598
- If we get caught
by her,

57:49.600 --> 57:52.167
she's gonna call the
cops, it all ends in cops!

57:52.169 --> 57:53.602
- Not if we talk our way
out of it.

57:53.604 --> 57:55.771
- How am I gonna talk my way out
of it?

57:55.773 --> 57:57.606
She knows me, intimately!

57:57.608 --> 58:00.075
Oh, so, am I like,
"hey, Jessica,

58:00.077 --> 58:01.009
"wow, what are you doin' here?

58:01.011 --> 58:02.377
"We're just trying to
rob this place,

58:02.379 --> 58:04.446
"small world after all, huh?"

58:04.448 --> 58:07.416
- Ok, so we hide you in the
fish and I do the talking.

58:07.418 --> 58:10.319
- Actually, uh,
she knows me, too.

58:11.421 --> 58:16.091
She hates me.

58:16.093 --> 58:18.427
- Ok, so we hide both of you.

58:18.429 --> 58:22.798
- Fine, so say that you spin
a real silver-tongued yarn

58:22.800 --> 58:26.134
and they let you go, how do we
get out?

58:27.403 --> 58:28.704
- I don't care.

58:35.378 --> 58:37.246
- She is not a good person!

58:37.248 --> 58:39.915
I mean, I know it's not
easy to be a good person

58:39.917 --> 58:41.583
when times are tough,
but that's how you know

58:41.585 --> 58:45.754
if you're a good person in
the first place, you know?

58:45.756 --> 58:48.457
- Yeah, I d-do, that, I used to,

58:49.759 --> 58:52.227
I know exactly what you mean.

58:53.396 --> 58:55.397
- Let's go make a plan.

58:56.699 --> 58:59.301
We dig, under and out.

58:59.303 --> 59:01.970
- I don't think we have that
kinda time.

59:01.972 --> 59:04.439
- Ok, um,

59:04.441 --> 59:05.641
we set a fire.

59:05.643 --> 59:06.475
- Where?

59:06.477 --> 59:07.609
- In the house.

59:07.611 --> 59:08.844
- In the fireplace?

59:08.846 --> 59:11.280
- No, we set the house on fire.

59:11.282 --> 59:14.449
Lots of smoke, confusion,
and then we slip away

59:14.451 --> 59:17.753
under the, uh, cover of chaos.

59:17.755 --> 59:20.923
- Or we die in a
terrible house fire!

59:22.191 --> 59:23.191
- Ok.

59:25.128 --> 59:27.195
Then same idea, no fire.

59:28.364 --> 59:30.232
- What's a fireless fire?

59:30.234 --> 59:32.467
- We just go, trip the alarm,

59:32.469 --> 59:35.003
and, uh, hide in the trees.

59:35.005 --> 59:35.003
- Ok.

59:35.005 --> 59:38.574
- Cops come, look around,
think it's a false alarm,

59:38.576 --> 59:41.843
and then, uh, we get outta here.

59:41.845 --> 59:42.844
- All right, that's progress,

59:42.846 --> 59:45.180
but we're still inside the gate.

59:45.182 --> 59:49.551
The whole community is fenced
in, we're like zoo animals.

59:49.553 --> 59:52.054
- So we just climb the fence.

59:53.323 --> 59:55.057
- Ok, uh, if we can,

59:55.992 --> 01:00:00.162
that would put us inside
another gated community.

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:04.232
- I, who are
these people

01:00:04.234 --> 01:00:07.669
trying to protect
themselves from, each other?

01:00:07.671 --> 01:00:12.207
Other marauding gangs of Volvo
drivers we don't know about?

01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:13.909
- We need the code.

01:00:13.911 --> 01:00:15.010
- I've looked everywhere.

01:00:15.012 --> 01:00:17.012
- Well, maybe it's in
the garage, that lockbox?

01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:18.680
- No.

01:00:18.682 --> 01:00:20.582
- You found the key?

01:00:20.584 --> 01:00:24.086
- No, it wasn't, um, with the
other keys.

01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:29.191
I haven't seen it, so it
probably just, you know.

01:00:29.193 --> 01:00:30.258
- Just what?

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:33.929
- I don't know.

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:37.332
- Well, might as well
look for it.

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:39.267
It might be our only hope.

01:00:39.269 --> 01:00:40.269
- Yeah, ok.

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:50.145
What are you doing?

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:52.247
- If we open the doors of the
rooms we've already searched,

01:00:52.249 --> 01:00:53.849
then we know we've
already been there.

01:00:53.851 --> 01:00:56.184
- We're looking for a tiny
key or a four-digit code.

01:00:56.186 --> 01:00:57.653
Do you think that you searched
these rooms

01:00:57.655 --> 01:00:58.754
well enough to just walk away...

01:00:58.756 --> 01:01:00.555
- I'm working in broad strokes.

01:01:00.557 --> 01:01:03.025
- Ok, fine, I don't.

01:01:03.961 --> 01:01:05.460
- Whoa, what the fuck?

01:01:05.462 --> 01:01:06.728
Whoa, watch the door!

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:08.830
- What the fuck is going on?

01:01:08.832 --> 01:01:09.665
- Who did this?

01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:10.632
- How did they get in here?

01:01:10.634 --> 01:01:11.700
- No, no, no!

01:01:11.702 --> 01:01:13.368
- What the fuck is
going on here?

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:14.703
- Just leave it, leave me!

01:01:14.705 --> 01:01:14.703
- We're not gonna leave you!

01:01:14.705 --> 01:01:17.305
- I'll be fine,
just worry about yourself!

01:01:17.307 --> 01:01:18.140
- Who did this?

01:01:18.142 --> 01:01:18.974
- How did they get in?

01:01:18.976 --> 01:01:19.808
- Nobody!
- Who?

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:19.808
- How many?

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:23.278
- Nobody did it, there's
nobody here!

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.647
- There's nobody here?

01:01:25.649 --> 01:01:26.649
- No.

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:30.852
- Then who tied you up?

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:34.690
- I did.

01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:41.663
- So you were just gonna
sell us up the river?

01:01:41.665 --> 01:01:44.099
- Don't get pissed off at me
just because I had a plan!

01:01:44.101 --> 01:01:45.300
- How'd you tie yourself
up like that?

01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:46.968
- That's not the point, Marlon!

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:50.338
- She picks locks, she ties
herself up in elaborate knots!

01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:53.041
You don't find that a curious
skill set for a dog Walker?

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:54.242
- I'm not a dog Walker.

01:01:54.244 --> 01:01:54.242
- See?

01:01:54.244 --> 01:01:57.546
- All right, they show up,
you're gagged and bound,

01:01:57.548 --> 01:02:01.416
so you're just a fellow victim
of this senseless crime.

01:02:01.418 --> 01:02:02.584
- You're the ones who
locked us in,

01:02:02.586 --> 01:02:05.420
I'm just looking for a way out!

01:02:05.422 --> 01:02:08.390
- Devious, very, very devious!

01:02:08.392 --> 01:02:10.225
- Why are your clothes off?

01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:11.860
- Look, it was just one idea.

01:02:11.862 --> 01:02:14.296
Probably not the best
one, can we just move on?

01:02:14.298 --> 01:02:15.597
- But why are they ripped?

01:02:15.599 --> 01:02:17.065
- Again, the clock is ticking,

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:19.835
let's not waste time
reliving past mistakes.

01:02:23.806 --> 01:02:27.509
If I needed to
and only if they were not

01:02:27.511 --> 01:02:31.747
buying my story, I might have
had to go with more of a,

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:35.851
kind of a sexual assault angle.

01:02:35.853 --> 01:02:37.085
- What?

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:38.787
- Devious, dirty little...

01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:41.723
- ok, looking at it
from your perspective,

01:02:41.725 --> 01:02:44.993
I can see how that was probably
too far.

01:02:44.995 --> 01:02:46.261
- Probably?

01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:48.663
- Definitely, definitely
too far,

01:02:48.665 --> 01:02:50.365
and I'm so glad it didn't come
to that,

01:02:50.367 --> 01:02:51.433
but you know,
there are always, like,

01:02:51.435 --> 01:02:53.668
a couple clunkers when
you're brainstorming.

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:55.003
- What, we weren't
brainstorming!

01:02:55.005 --> 01:02:57.539
You were setting us up
for charges of kidnapping,

01:02:57.541 --> 01:03:00.242
of, uh, assault and battery,
and rape!

01:03:00.244 --> 01:03:01.343
- And burglary.

01:03:01.345 --> 01:03:02.544
- That doesn't concern me
right now.

01:03:02.546 --> 01:03:05.580
- Well, that's where
we're back to, burglary.

01:03:05.582 --> 01:03:06.815
- I haven't taken anything,

01:03:06.817 --> 01:03:10.285
so breaking and entering, maybe.

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:13.722
- We didn't break
anything, we used the key.

01:03:13.724 --> 01:03:16.191
We did stain the rug, but
that's not technically broken.

01:03:16.193 --> 01:03:19.027
- The point is,
we're in trouble!

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:22.864
- But trouble is
just an opportunity

01:03:22.866 --> 01:03:25.100
that got turned around,
am I right?

01:03:25.102 --> 01:03:25.100
- Yeah.

01:03:25.102 --> 01:03:28.637
- What kind of fortune
cookie bullshit is that?

01:03:28.639 --> 01:03:32.841
- That's not bullshit, that
is solid, deep thinking!

01:03:33.743 --> 01:03:37.913
- Hey, fish, uh, you know where
you found everything else?

01:03:37.915 --> 01:03:39.281
- What about it?

01:03:39.283 --> 01:03:41.449
- Are you sure you didn't
miss anything?

01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:44.119
- Yes, I'm sure I didn't
miss anything!

01:03:44.121 --> 01:03:47.389
I don't need the accusations,
thank you very much.

01:03:47.391 --> 01:03:48.623
- Worth looking at, though.

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:51.726
- What, eh, wh-why are
you taking her side?

01:03:51.728 --> 01:03:52.961
- I'm not takin' anyone's side,

01:03:52.963 --> 01:03:56.665
I'm just sayin' it's
worth double-checking.

01:03:56.667 --> 01:03:58.733
- Ugh, that's fucked up!

01:04:05.007 --> 01:04:06.208
- I can't feel anything.

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:07.042
- Told ya.

01:04:07.044 --> 01:04:08.243
- Get way back in there.

01:04:08.245 --> 01:04:09.177
- I am!

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:10.912
- Maybe we should
get a flashlight,

01:04:10.914 --> 01:04:12.614
is there a flashlight anywh...

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:14.850
What is this?

01:04:14.852 --> 01:04:17.052
- Nothing, it's, it's
not what you think it is!

01:04:17.054 --> 01:04:18.153
- What do I think it is?
- Oh my god!

01:04:18.155 --> 01:04:18.987
- I don't know.

01:04:18.989 --> 01:04:21.623
- All right, give!
- Oh, fuck!

01:04:29.766 --> 01:04:33.902
- I just didn't think you
needed the distraction!

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:37.339
We're trying to get out
of here, y'know, so I.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.680
- Holy shit!

01:04:48.418 --> 01:04:50.252
- Sometimes I wake
up and think Leo is there

01:04:50.254 --> 01:04:54.256
in the bed beside me, and my
heart sinks when I realize.

01:04:54.258 --> 01:04:56.291
He used to say,

01:04:56.293 --> 01:04:59.361
"trouble is just an opportunity
that got turned around,"

01:04:59.363 --> 01:05:00.829
but I don't know if I'll
ever get turned back around.

01:05:00.831 --> 01:05:02.864
Poor Carl walked in on me crying

01:05:02.866 --> 01:05:05.467
during a documentary about
Niagara Falls.

01:05:05.469 --> 01:05:07.769
Everything, every feeling
was still right there.

01:05:07.771 --> 01:05:10.639
I wish I could just have a
tomato juice and calm down.

01:05:10.641 --> 01:05:12.307
It worked for Leo,

01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:14.042
I'd have to drink about
a gallon at this point.

01:05:14.044 --> 01:05:18.346
Things got tough with Leo,
and I wasn't a good person,

01:05:18.348 --> 01:05:21.816
so maybe I was never a good
person in the first place.

01:05:21.818 --> 01:05:23.018
I know that now.

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:33.895
- Why would she cut out
the pages of her own.

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:40.302
- All that time with
Jessica, I never,

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:43.772
she dumped you, left.

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:47.609
I'm still here, always.

01:05:50.347 --> 01:05:52.347
We've been talkin' about
this heist for forever

01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:55.784
and, you know,
a little bit of excitement.

01:05:55.786 --> 01:05:59.788
Doin' our own thing, some
teamwork, but,

01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:01.556
now it's just the same shit!

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:04.292
You had Jessica,
now you have her!

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:05.527
- Her?

01:06:05.529 --> 01:06:08.296
She's gonna tell the
cops that I raped her!

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:10.632
- I believe I apologized.

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:13.368
- This is the whole reason
that we broke in here.

01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:15.570
- No, it's the whole
reason you broke in here!

01:06:15.572 --> 01:06:18.974
- This is crazy, this, this
changes everything!

01:06:18.976 --> 01:06:22.877
She still...

01:06:22.879 --> 01:06:24.279
I know the code.

01:06:25.781 --> 01:06:26.781
- What?

01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:31.052
- I know the code,
it's our anniversary.

01:06:31.054 --> 01:06:32.287
- No, you don't know!

01:06:32.289 --> 01:06:33.288
- No, I know!

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:35.190
- No, you don't know!

01:06:35.192 --> 01:06:36.891
You're gonna fuck around
and get us all arrested

01:06:36.893 --> 01:06:39.294
just 'cause you read some
cotton candy thoughts

01:06:39.296 --> 01:06:40.862
in her little girl diary,

01:06:40.864 --> 01:06:41.997
but you don't know the code!

01:06:41.999 --> 01:06:42.999
- Ok, now,

01:06:45.234 --> 01:06:47.936
we haven't been at our best,
any of us,

01:06:47.938 --> 01:06:50.939
and maybe someday,
we'll all sit down,

01:06:50.941 --> 01:06:54.175
break bread and have our
apologies and tender moments

01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:56.711
and whatnot and that'll be nice,
I'm sure.

01:06:56.713 --> 01:06:59.114
But right now, this is over.

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:02.684
I'm getting us out of here,

01:07:02.686 --> 01:07:03.985
because I know.

01:07:14.898 --> 01:07:15.898
There.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:19.868
Now, let's go.

01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:22.704
- Fuck!

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:23.872
- What, that can't be...

01:07:23.874 --> 01:07:26.007
Let's go, we gotta run,
hide in the bushes!

01:07:26.009 --> 01:07:26.941
- I don't understand!

01:07:26.943 --> 01:07:28.543
- We're fucked, we run,
let's go!

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:30.612
- Wait, we have to stay!

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:32.747
- What are you, nuts?

01:07:32.749 --> 01:07:34.482
- No, there's only one way out.

01:07:34.484 --> 01:07:36.084
- Yeah, the door, let's go!

01:07:36.086 --> 01:07:38.853
- No, it's not the door.

01:07:38.855 --> 01:07:40.688
It's him, he's right.

01:07:42.691 --> 01:07:43.691
He knows.

01:08:07.516 --> 01:08:08.516
- Hello?

01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:16.524
This is the police!

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.134
Everybody ok?

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:45.687
- Oh, oh, ho-ho, oh, thank god!

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:49.591
Honey, honey, the security
guard's here!

01:08:49.593 --> 01:08:51.426
- Oh, I'm so sorry!

01:08:51.428 --> 01:08:52.460
- What?

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.696
- I'm so sorry about this.

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:59.634
- Kill the alarm,
I'm on the scene.

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:01.870
Hold the backup, stand by.

01:09:04.038 --> 01:09:04.872
- Oh!

01:09:04.875 --> 01:09:06.573
- Oh, god, thank you.

01:09:06.576 --> 01:09:08.943
- Uh, I'm sorry, I,

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:11.246
I misplaced the little
slip of paper

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:14.515
that my sister wrote the code on
for me,

01:09:14.518 --> 01:09:18.586
so, god, that alarm is
such a pain sometimes!

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:21.156
- Yeah, sometimes.

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:26.594
You said miss deevers
is your sister?

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:27.895
- That's right.

01:09:29.865 --> 01:09:34.602
That's me and, uh, my sister,
Jessica, the homeowner,

01:09:34.604 --> 01:09:38.506
with our younger sister
Carla and mom and dad.

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:43.810
It's in Virginia
city, have you ever been?

01:09:43.813 --> 01:09:44.645
- Nope.

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:46.247
- Oh, it's a thing to see,

01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:49.450
just like you'da pictured
the old west to have been.

01:09:49.452 --> 01:09:51.786
Like, it's a lotta fun.

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:53.821
- Well, I'll have to
check that out sometime.

01:09:53.823 --> 01:09:55.690
- You'll have to
take me,

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:58.626
god, he talks about it all the
time, but we've never gone.

01:09:58.628 --> 01:10:00.628
- Well, you know.

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:01.796
You get busy.

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:06.167
- I've met your folks before.

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.270
Yeah, your dad.

01:10:09.272 --> 01:10:10.805
- Randy.

01:10:10.807 --> 01:10:12.040
- Yeah, Randy.

01:10:12.684 --> 01:10:13.943
Uh, he helped me out,

01:10:13.944 --> 01:10:17.445
I was havin' some trouble with
the gate.

01:10:17.447 --> 01:10:19.747
- Well, I bet he
loved that.

01:10:19.749 --> 01:10:22.250
He's so good with those
sorts of things.

01:10:22.252 --> 01:10:26.321
He should've been a mechanic
or maybe a surgeon, even.

01:10:26.323 --> 01:10:28.156
Anything but insurance.

01:10:28.158 --> 01:10:31.392
- Yeah, well, he, yeah,
he fixed it right up, so.

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:33.895
And your mom made these, um...

01:10:33.897 --> 01:10:36.331
- I hope it was the lemon bars.

01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:37.165
- Yeah, that's right.

01:10:37.167 --> 01:10:38.967
- Lucky,

01:10:38.969 --> 01:10:40.935
those are the only things
she knows how to make.

01:10:40.937 --> 01:10:42.804
- Well, they were good, so.

01:10:42.806 --> 01:10:44.672
- Well, you dodged a bullet.

01:10:44.674 --> 01:10:46.507
Seriously, I've never
seen a woman

01:10:46.509 --> 01:10:49.010
make more of a disaster of
snickerdoodles.

01:10:49.012 --> 01:10:52.180
It's terrible, but you have to
eat 'em.

01:10:52.182 --> 01:10:55.483
- I don't remember you folks
comin' in.

01:10:55.485 --> 01:10:57.485
- Oh, you know, I think the, uh,

01:10:57.487 --> 01:11:00.255
the other gentleman was working.

01:11:00.257 --> 01:11:01.856
- Leslie?

01:11:01.858 --> 01:11:03.658
- Ooh, I don't...
- Um.

01:11:04.693 --> 01:11:08.363
- Yeah, he, he did work
the day shift.

01:11:08.365 --> 01:11:11.065
Normally, he lets me
know if we have visitors.

01:11:11.067 --> 01:11:13.067
- Yeah, uh, well, if
there's some paperwork

01:11:13.069 --> 01:11:14.469
that we're supposed to
fill out or something,

01:11:14.471 --> 01:11:16.037
we'd be happy to do it, I mean...

01:11:16.039 --> 01:11:18.306
- no, you know, it's just
normally, people let us know

01:11:18.308 --> 01:11:21.209
if they're gonna have
guests while they're away.

01:11:21.211 --> 01:11:25.480
- Well, Jessica, details
aren't really her thing.

01:11:25.482 --> 01:11:28.116
She just told us to get out
of the city for a couple days,

01:11:28.118 --> 01:11:31.352
and, you know, spend
some quiet time together.

01:11:31.354 --> 01:11:34.656
- We just
got engaged.

01:11:34.658 --> 01:11:36.391
- Well, congratulations!

01:11:36.393 --> 01:11:38.593
That's fantastic!
- Yeah, thank you, thanks.

01:11:38.595 --> 01:11:41.429
- Phone's
ready, here it comes.

01:11:41.431 --> 01:11:43.798
What is the only
variety of grape

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.734
that is actually named
after a god?

01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:54.709
- Can we get you
somethin' to eat?

01:11:54.711 --> 01:11:57.111
- Oh, god, I'd offer you
some soup, but, aw god,

01:11:57.113 --> 01:12:01.883
that darn alarm went out and,
god, it just surprised me!

01:12:01.885 --> 01:12:05.887
- Uh, maybe some pretzels
or chips, or ravioli?

01:12:08.925 --> 01:12:11.059
Some people don't like
eating it out of the can,

01:12:11.061 --> 01:12:13.261
but it reminds me of growing up.

01:12:13.263 --> 01:12:15.730
- Uh, no, I'm good, thank you.

01:12:15.732 --> 01:12:17.365
- Oh,
I'm told we have a caller,

01:12:17.367 --> 01:12:18.866
and just in time!

01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:22.236
Hello, are you ready to
reveal the impossible?

01:12:22.238 --> 01:12:24.238
- Yes, it's sangiovese.

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.007
- Uh,
I-I'm sorry,

01:12:26.009 --> 01:12:28.843
you need to speak up, please.

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:31.212
- It's sangiovese!

01:12:31.214 --> 01:12:33.114
- That's
correct!

01:12:33.116 --> 01:12:34.148
- Whoa!

01:12:35.752 --> 01:12:39.987
- Oh, that is, some people
have all the luck, huh?

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:47.161
- Man, I bet that guy's
partyin' hard wherever he is!

01:12:47.163 --> 01:12:49.197
- No doubt!

01:12:49.199 --> 01:12:50.031
Congratulations,

01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:52.867
you've just won $105,000!

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:54.602
What's your name?

01:12:54.604 --> 01:12:56.170
- Marlon.

01:12:56.172 --> 01:12:58.573
- Like
the fish?

01:12:58.575 --> 01:13:00.975
- Yeah, yeah, like the fish.

01:13:06.516 --> 01:13:08.349
- Uh, well, apologies again

01:13:08.351 --> 01:13:10.451
for causing all the ruckus,
y'know?

01:13:10.453 --> 01:13:12.153
- No problem at all.

01:13:12.155 --> 01:13:13.421
Happens all the time.

01:13:13.423 --> 01:13:16.290
These alarms are more
trouble than they're worth.

01:13:16.292 --> 01:13:18.626
I mean, to be honest,
it's kind of a letdown.

01:13:18.628 --> 01:13:21.028
Just once, I wanna come
in, guns a'blazin',

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:24.298
have it out with some scumbags.

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.134
We can dream, though, right?

01:13:26.136 --> 01:13:27.769
You have a good night.

01:13:27.771 --> 01:13:31.672
Oh, shit, sorry, guys.

01:13:32.941 --> 01:13:35.743
I just gotta go by the
book with this kinda stuff.

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:36.811
- Of course.

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:40.448
- I just need you to
tell me the safe word.

01:13:40.450 --> 01:13:44.185
- Rutabaga, sorry,
that's our safe word.

01:13:44.187 --> 01:13:45.653
Ah, sorry, overshare.

01:13:45.655 --> 01:13:50.491
- H-honey, , uh, uh,
safe word?

01:13:50.493 --> 01:13:52.827
- Yeah, you know, the word
you're supposed to know

01:13:52.829 --> 01:13:54.595
when you're in the house.

01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:56.998
Just clears that you're
actually allowed to be here.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:01.003 --> 01:14:04.372
- You can call your sister
if you need to, that's fine.

01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:17.652
- Ooh, one word you say?

01:14:17.654 --> 01:14:18.654
- Yeah.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:24.960
- Honey,

01:14:27.396 --> 01:14:28.396
you know.

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:43.945
- Niagara.

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:49.917
- That's the one.

01:14:49.919 --> 01:14:51.052
You guys have a good night.

01:14:51.054 --> 01:14:52.086
- Oh, uh, you, too.

01:14:52.088 --> 01:14:54.956
Oh, hey, um, you can
leave that open,

01:14:54.958 --> 01:14:56.824
we're gonna head to the store in
a second.

01:14:56.826 --> 01:14:58.226
Start over with that soup.

01:14:58.228 --> 01:15:00.228
- The soup, yeah.

01:15:00.230 --> 01:15:01.963
- Sounds good to me.

01:15:23.485 --> 01:15:24.652
- Let's get the fuck outta here!

01:15:24.654 --> 01:15:26.287
- Fish!

01:15:26.289 --> 01:15:27.388
- Did you hear that shit?

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:28.222
- Let's go!

01:15:28.224 --> 01:15:29.224
- $105,000!

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:31.626
- Congratulations, let's go!

01:15:31.628 --> 01:15:32.493
- Let's load these up!

01:15:32.495 --> 01:15:33.327
- No time.

01:15:33.329 --> 01:15:34.161
- What about the pizza?

01:15:34.163 --> 01:15:34.996
- What?

01:15:34.998 --> 01:15:35.830
- Our ride?

01:15:35.832 --> 01:15:36.664
- I have my car!

01:15:36.666 --> 01:15:38.065
- Go, go, go!

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:48.709
- Hold on, let me make
room for you.

01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:53.714
- You leave anything there?

01:15:53.716 --> 01:15:56.918
- Nope.

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:57.920
No, wait!

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.240
Bye.

01:16:40.964 --> 01:16:43.164
- Chocolate chip pancakes?

01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:44.899
Those sound amazing.

01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:47.902
- Yeah, people like them.

01:16:47.904 --> 01:16:51.205
- You know what, we might
be one-percenters, almost.

01:16:51.207 --> 01:16:54.141
You know, collectively,
our forces combined.

01:16:54.143 --> 01:16:56.477
But with this kind of
seed money,

01:16:56.479 --> 01:16:58.613
we could plan a proper job.

01:16:58.615 --> 01:17:01.182
You know, we're experienced
now, we can go big!

01:17:01.184 --> 01:17:03.217
Something with grappling hooks,

01:17:03.219 --> 01:17:05.920
or go all d.B. Cooper,
fuckin' legends!

01:17:05.922 --> 01:17:07.521
- Maybe we could just get

01:17:07.523 --> 01:17:10.257
a little breakfast first, and
then see...

01:17:10.259 --> 01:17:12.360
- yeah, yeah, yeah,
of course, um,

01:17:12.362 --> 01:17:15.529
breakfast is on me by the way.

01:17:15.531 --> 01:17:19.266
Huh, I should give
this to that guy.

01:17:19.268 --> 01:17:21.002
- I'll get this one.

01:17:22.204 --> 01:17:24.872
I owe Darcy a breakfast anyhow.

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:30.578
- Uh, ok,
so now that we're all, um,

01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:32.980
it's actually Kate, my name.

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:37.318
- Devious.

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.554
- Where you gonna put
that lamp?

01:17:40.556 --> 01:17:41.722
- Craigslist.

01:17:43.558 --> 01:17:45.493
It's our only score
from the job.

01:17:45.495 --> 01:17:46.495
- Well,

01:17:47.362 --> 01:17:48.362
and this.

01:17:49.097 --> 01:17:50.898
- What, that's crazy!

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:55.302
Man, do they have celebration
items on a breakfast menu?

01:17:55.304 --> 01:17:59.573
What would that be, like
an enormous pile of bacon?

01:17:59.575 --> 01:18:01.575
We're goin' places, I'll tell
you that.

01:18:01.577 --> 01:18:04.045
Non-tropical places, I'm
standing my ground
on that issue,

01:18:04.047 --> 01:18:05.980
but everything else is open,

01:18:05.982 --> 01:18:07.782
'cause you gotta keep
yourself open to new things.

01:18:07.784 --> 01:18:11.452
Keep it fresh, otherwise,
you get stuck.

01:18:11.454 --> 01:18:13.554
I mean, you can't make a
plan to know about something

01:18:13.556 --> 01:18:16.590
that you don't already
know about.

01:18:16.592 --> 01:18:19.960
Hold up, that's fuckin'
wisdom right there.

01:18:19.962 --> 01:18:21.696
Yep, I just know it.
