From aardvark to zebra,
I've read about everything.

00:38.288 --> 00:42.876
It's just when I get in front of people,
I freeze up like a warthog in an ice bath.

<i>Look at the stars.</i>

So, the sun crests on the horizon, right?
And all the animals are looking up

From the first time we saw Rafiki
holding up the newborn Simba

02:06.918 --> 02:12.632
for all to see. It was instantly carved
into our minds as a symbol of power,

02:12.882 --> 02:16.094
royalty, and cuteness.

02:16.886 --> 02:20.515

Simba and one of his companions crossing
the waterfall together on the log.

02:58.219 --> 03:02.557
Now, on these stone slabs are three
different stages of Simba's journey.

03:03.183 --> 03:08.271
Young Simba, adolescent Simba,
and adult Simba. You'll each take one

03:08.354 --> 03:12.775
to determine which Simba you're building.
And to complete our circle of life,

03:12.984 --> 03:17.238
your three finished creations
will fit together as one large diorama

In <i>The Lion King, </i>Simba gets separated
from his dad, right?

family stuff,

06:32.183 --> 06:35.520

So, we have young Simba right here,

in this story.

LONDON: <i>I'm... I'm feeling</i>
<i>a little stressed, but I think</i>

09:25.898 --> 09:28.901
that if I can just stay focused,
I can knock out the two characters.

09:29.026 --> 09:31.946
A little stress is always good,
but don't doubt yourself

09:32.029 --> 09:33.948
'cause you're amazing and you're talented.

09:34.198 --> 09:38.369
The great thing about our team
is we all have just the utmost respect

09:38.452 --> 09:41.622
for each other. We all met at a culinary
school in Charlotte, North Carolina.

09:41.706 --> 09:44.458
-SCHELLIE:<i> I'm a chef instructor.</i>
-AUSTIN:<i> And I was her teaching assistant.</i>

09:44.584 --> 09:47.128
<i>And then, London is one of our students.</i>

09:47.211 --> 09:49.630
Why are you leaning? Stop leaning. (SIGHS)

09:49.755 --> 09:51.966
You okay? Really, tell me the truth.
What do you need?

09:52.091 --> 09:54.802
I'm building it up 'cause I don't want it
to be too small on that body.

09:55.177 --> 09:57.763
SCHELLIE:
<i>London is an amazing cake decorator.</i>

09:57.847 --> 10:01.309
<i>She would test recipes for me.</i>
<i>That's how good she was.</i>

10:01.851 --> 10:05.896
-I don't feel confident in this at all.
-SCHELLIE: You've got it, London.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.064
(LONDON SIGHING)

10:07.148 --> 10:09.817
I noticed London on day two of class.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.819
<i>She's super talented.</i>

10:11.944 --> 10:14.447
<i>Your other classmates, literally,</i>
<i>I would hear 'em all the time,</i>

10:14.530 --> 10:15.615
<i>"London's so talented."</i>

10:15.823 --> 10:18.993
And any of your previous instructors,
'cause we do talk.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.661
-Yeah, I learned... I learned that.
-Oh, yeah, all of us talk.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.121
-It's like the big gossips.
-Recently, I learned that.

10:22.413 --> 10:23.664
BENNY: Hi, Storytellers.

10:23.748 --> 10:24.957
-Hello. How's it going?
-Hi. How are you?

10:25.082 --> 10:26.292
How are you guys feeling so far?

10:27.543 --> 10:28.711
-Good.
-Are you stressed out?

10:28.836 --> 10:32.256
LONDON: I'm just worried
about his head being proportionate, so...

10:32.340 --> 10:34.842
Yes, that... It's extremely important.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.594
Aka, make the head bigger, London.
(CHUCKLES)

10:36.969 --> 10:39.138
LONDON:
Oh, yeah, I'm tryna go for accuracy.

10:39.347 --> 10:42.350
I know what you're going through.
I know how stressful that can be.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.435
-AUSTIN: Absolutely.
-But just take a step back

10:44.518 --> 10:47.313
and then look at the proportions.
Just keep that in mind.

10:47.521 --> 10:48.981
-LONDON: (CHUCKLES) Thank you.
-AUSTIN: Thank you.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.274
See you later.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.443
AUSTIN:
I think he is referring to the head.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.904
-He just... he wants it bigger.
-LONDON: Yeah, it looks...

10:54.987 --> 10:57.740
<i>That's what my biggest concern is,</i>
<i>but I'm like, how am I gonna build it out?</i>

10:57.823 --> 11:01.744
<i>Benny is looking for everything</i>
<i>to be right. I feel like it means a lot.</i>

11:02.203 --> 11:04.664
It's people like him
that I look up to and that I learn from.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.791
AUSTIN: You should cover the whole head
in cereal treats

11:06.916 --> 11:08.376
and then we can make it larger. (CHUCKLES)

11:08.459 --> 11:10.252
LONDON: Or I could just build it out
of modelling chocolate 'cause...

11:10.336 --> 11:13.172
-SCHELLIE: Yeah.
-Okay. This ear needs to be bigger.

11:15.841 --> 11:20.262
TAMMY: <i>Currently, right now, on Simba.</i>
<i>I have to finish carving him.</i>

11:20.346 --> 11:24.183
<i>Once I'm happy with his shape,</i>
<i>we're gonna cover him with chocolate</i>

11:24.266 --> 11:26.018
and then we'll add all our details.

11:26.143 --> 11:29.939
MICHELLE: Are any of the paws game...
free game, or... to cover, coat?

11:30.022 --> 11:32.274
You can cover,
but I've gotta carve 'em down.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.318
So, nothing's ready to coat yet?

11:34.819 --> 11:36.987
-No. No.
-Okay.

11:37.071 --> 11:39.073
MICHELLE: All right, I guess we can wait
on that. (SIGHING)

11:39.198 --> 11:42.451
TAMMY: <i>The challenging part</i>
<i>is the size of him. He's very huge</i>

11:42.618 --> 11:46.706
and you have to get all the angles right
and the muscle structures right.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.958
I feel like his shape is good,
you don't think?

11:49.083 --> 11:50.918
Yes, but when you add the stuff,
it's gonna bulk him up...

11:51.001 --> 11:52.211
-MICHELLE: I know.
-...then he'll be too big.

11:52.336 --> 11:55.506
So, finish doin' all the stuff you guys
need to do.

11:55.673 --> 11:58.676
Let me finish this and then we'll be good.

11:59.385 --> 12:02.638
DYLAN: I would honestly leave it, Tammy.
It looks... it looks great.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.765
It... it's too thick though, Dylan.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.810
DYLAN: <i>It's a little challenging</i>
<i>when some people have certain ideas</i>

12:07.977 --> 12:10.855
<i>on how to do things.</i>
<i>It can slow some other teammates down.</i>

12:11.063 --> 12:12.523
-There's a lot to do.
-Yes.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.734
DYLAN: Maybe you should tell her
the leg is okay.

12:14.817 --> 12:15.818
I've tried.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.158
<i>The Lion King,</i> for me,
is childhood, really.

12:22.324 --> 12:24.702
<i>It was one of the first Disney movies</i>
<i>that I ever watched.</i>

12:24.785 --> 12:26.495
CHRIS: That looks good.
Starting to come together.

12:26.620 --> 12:27.621
TREY: A little bit.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.498
I can relate to Simba in a lot of ways.

12:29.665 --> 12:34.336
<i>Just kind of that lost soul,</i>
<i>but then he's able to find his own family.</i>

12:34.503 --> 12:36.338
And that's how I kind of have
to view myself every day.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.299
-TATOR: How's it comin' over there?
-Not too bad.

12:38.466 --> 12:41.385
I'm gonna start settin' these pieces up
on top. That way the royal icing

12:41.469 --> 12:43.095
-doesn't slide down.
-TATOR: Okay.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.930
It's getting kinda hot in here,
so I'm tryna do that

12:45.014 --> 12:46.056
to control the temperature.

12:46.182 --> 12:49.351
CHRIS:<i> It is a little warm. I mean,</i>
<i>we are right next to the setting sun here.</i>

12:49.477 --> 12:50.728
-(CHUCKLES)
-TATOR: I liked the sun before,

12:50.811 --> 12:52.104
I don't like it so much now.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.064
Why you gotta put the scary sun

12:54.148 --> 12:55.232
-next to us?
-(CHRIS CHUCKLING)

12:55.399 --> 12:58.068
TATOR: <i>So, I'm making Pumbaa</i>
<i>and young Simba</i>

12:58.277 --> 12:59.695
<i>completely out of sourdough bread bowls.</i>

12:59.862 --> 13:01.739
CHRIS: Tator, you look like
you're out sellin' bread right now.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.866
TATOR: <i>I've never actually carved</i>
<i>with bread before,</i>

13:03.949 --> 13:06.285
<i>but one of the things that I like</i>
<i>about the bread so far,</i>

13:06.368 --> 13:08.287
<i>from a structural standpoint,</i>
<i>it's very strong.</i>

13:08.829 --> 13:11.207
You want me to carve more?
Cut it down to that.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.083
CHRIS:
I would think just a little more. Yeah.

13:13.209 --> 13:16.170
The overall muscle structure
has to be carved into this

13:16.295 --> 13:19.173
so that when we put the pasta over it,
I get the right shape.

13:19.298 --> 13:22.760
-TREY: It's starting to look like Pumbaa.
-TATOR: Right? Slowly, but surely.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.596
-How are you guys comin'? You good?
-CHRIS: I'm gonna start wrappin'

13:25.679 --> 13:27.389
-your legs, do the pasta.
-TATOR: Okay.

13:27.556 --> 13:28.849
CHRIS: <i>We're making the skin</i>
<i>for these animals</i>

13:28.974 --> 13:32.520
<i>and we're trying to veer away from,</i>
<i>cakes and sweets.</i>

13:32.728 --> 13:35.397
We really wanted to go savory,
especially with the animals.

13:35.481 --> 13:39.068
<i>So, I need something to replicate fondant.</i>
<i>I have to use fresh pasta,</i>

13:39.193 --> 13:41.779
<i>because I need a sheet to be able</i>
<i>to drape over this.</i>

13:41.862 --> 13:43.072
-Put this on.
-Yeah.

13:43.155 --> 13:47.493
Just touch the bread, the lip bread.
God, that sounds so weird.

13:48.035 --> 13:51.205
<i>I've got three types of pasta.</i>
<i>Number one is a chocolate pasta.</i>

13:51.539 --> 13:53.040
<i>We've gotta have that color for Pumbaa.</i>

13:53.249 --> 13:57.294
<i>Then I gotta make a semolina egg pasta,</i>
<i>that hopefully really matches the color</i>

13:57.378 --> 14:00.965
<i>of Simba, and last, squid ink</i>
<i>'cause I need that nice black</i>

14:01.173 --> 14:04.051
<i>to go onto, like, the hooves.</i>
<i>We're trying to use natural colors.</i>

14:04.301 --> 14:05.845
<i>Hopefully, it comes across.</i>

14:06.554 --> 14:07.638
Lucky Charms.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.890
-Hey, hey!
-BENNY: How are you guys doing here?

14:09.974 --> 14:11.433
-CHRIS: What's going on?
-TREY: Fabulous. How are you?

14:11.684 --> 14:13.936
I see, a few bumps in the body.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.564
-I see seams all over the place.
-CHRIS: Yes.

14:16.647 --> 14:17.815
-BENNY: I'm a little worried.
-CHRIS: Yep.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.441
What's the plan?

14:19.733 --> 14:23.070
With all the hairs and furs we have,
once it starts flowin' together,

14:23.195 --> 14:26.365
-it's gonna look great.
-Just make sure that no seam is exposed.

14:26.532 --> 14:27.867
-Okay. You got it.
-Okay?

14:28.075 --> 14:29.577
-Thank you.
-TREY: Thank you, Benny.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.123
SCHELLIE: I started some vegetation.

14:34.582 --> 14:38.586
And I'm gonna make a few more
of these onion lotus flowers.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.754
We're gonna make a few more mushrooms,

14:40.880 --> 14:44.174
and then we're gonna make
stargazer flowers out of this.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.511
I cut them on a slicer and trim them up
with my crimper.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.763
And then I think we should be good.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.558
And right now, we have an umbrella tree
in the fall.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.769
Gonna start mixing this micro sponge
for it, Schellie.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.354
Are you? Okay, cool.

14:57.521 --> 15:00.900
That's gonna be really cool
for our umbrella tree.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.778
In order to cover the whole umbrella tree.
We need a ton of micro sponge

15:04.904 --> 15:07.364
<i>that we're gonna use for the leaves</i>
<i>on the tree.</i>

15:07.489 --> 15:09.575
<i>This is the batter we're gonna use</i>
<i>for the leaves.</i>

15:09.742 --> 15:15.039
<i>I'm charging it twice with NO2 cartridges,</i>
<i>which is helping to aerate the batter.</i>

15:15.247 --> 15:18.334
<i>And I'm microwaving 'em for one minute.</i>
<i>And it creates this really nice,</i>

15:18.459 --> 15:20.711
<i>fluffy cake texture</i>
<i>that we can just pull apart</i>

15:21.045 --> 15:23.422
and really create nice detail,

15:23.505 --> 15:26.050
and we'll stick that up there
into our tree.

15:26.216 --> 15:27.927
Schellie, this is what you would do,
right? (CHUCKLING)

15:28.093 --> 15:29.303
-SCHELLIE: <i>Absolutely.</i>
-AUSTIN: <i>Okay.</i>

15:29.428 --> 15:31.221
Let's talk about our Storytellers.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.349
I know his neck is a little too small,
I'm gonna build that up

15:33.432 --> 15:35.059
<i>-with more modelling chocolate, but...</i>
-SCHELLIE: <i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

15:35.142 --> 15:37.019
-AUSTIN: <i>Yeah. But no he looks good.</i>
-LONDON: <i>His ear's good? Okay.</i>

15:37.102 --> 15:40.773
London is a student,
and she was so scared about the Simba.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.942
And I feel like she made
a lot of adjustments

15:43.067 --> 15:44.068
that actually helped.

15:44.151 --> 15:46.445
LONDON: I... I'm sculpting his face
as I'm adding more.

15:46.612 --> 15:49.239
She is nervous as all get out,
because that face,

15:49.323 --> 15:50.866
-is just really important...
-BENNY: I mean,

15:50.950 --> 15:53.786
I was just worried with the proportion
of the head originally,

15:53.869 --> 15:56.163
<i>but I believe that she's gonna start</i>
<i>layering chocolate...</i>

15:56.288 --> 15:58.457
-AMIRAH: <i>On the back.</i>
<i>-...so I hope that it makes sense more</i>

15:58.624 --> 16:01.126
-with the proportions of the actual body.
-KEKE: Yeah.

16:01.251 --> 16:04.004
The team that I'm worried of
is just Ladies and the Champ.

16:04.088 --> 16:07.091
TAMMY: (SIGHING) I cut more off
than I should have.

16:07.174 --> 16:10.511
They're the only ones
that haven't covered Simba at all.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.680
DYLAN: That looks great.
We just need to get chocolate on it.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.765
TAMMY: I still have to carve
this down though, Dylan.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.600
I have to carve it,
'cause it's too chunky.

16:16.725 --> 16:19.144
I just hope that the three of them
can really prove

16:19.228 --> 16:22.606
-that they can work together.
-KEKE: Let's talk about our Lucky Charms.

16:22.982 --> 16:27.069
BENNY: <i>I'm still trying to understand</i>
<i>their idea of the pasta layers...</i>

16:27.194 --> 16:28.529
-KEKE:<i> Yes.</i>
<i>-...on top of the characters,</i>

16:28.696 --> 16:31.407
because what I'm seeing right now
is just multiple layers placed

16:31.490 --> 16:34.118
-in different areas.
-AMIRAH: But it is artistic and I think

16:34.201 --> 16:36.495
<i>that the artistic choice</i>
<i>that they're doing</i>

16:36.704 --> 16:38.706
is sort of giving me skin vibes, right?

16:38.789 --> 16:42.876
If you look right at the knee,
those folds, I feel like he's moving.

16:43.043 --> 16:45.421
I get it.
But it looks a little bit like patches.

16:45.504 --> 16:48.007
You would like it to be a little bit
smoother and a little bit more...

16:48.132 --> 16:50.092
-Correct.
-...seamless, but as you're saying,

16:50.175 --> 16:51.885
it's kind of cool that it's not seamless,

16:52.052 --> 16:54.513
<i>it's kind of cool</i>
<i>that it's a little bit more avant-garde.</i>

16:54.596 --> 16:56.265
-AMIRAH: <i>Totally.</i>
-BENNY:<i> It's all about</i>

16:56.348 --> 17:00.853
<i>how they're gonna place the hair now,</i>
<i>because I want to see Simba's fur.</i>

17:00.978 --> 17:02.730
I'm glad I'm not in your position.

17:02.813 --> 17:03.981
(ALL CHUCKLING)

17:04.189 --> 17:06.483
NARRATOR: <i>While all the teams</i>
<i>struggle with Simba's likeness,</i>

17:06.567 --> 17:08.193
<i>let's check in with our tour guide.</i>

17:08.944 --> 17:11.989
<i>I have an update.</i>
<i>Your visual aids are coming along well.</i>

17:12.072 --> 17:13.907
Wow. What can I say?

17:14.158 --> 17:17.036
You're giving me
a problem-free philosophy.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.912
You're the Timon to my Pumbaa.

17:19.038 --> 17:22.332
-Or is it the Pumbaa to my Timon?
-NARRATOR: <i>Either way.</i>

17:22.416 --> 17:25.085
<i>And what a perfect segue</i>
<i>into the next part of your story.</i>

17:25.252 --> 17:29.298
Yes, the next part where I talk
about what, exactly?

17:29.423 --> 17:31.717
NARRATOR:<i> Where you tell us</i>
<i>how Simba grew big and strong.</i>

17:31.800 --> 17:35.721
Right. Oh, this is the part, I remember,
where Simba and his new friends

17:35.804 --> 17:38.557
were living their life with no worries.

17:38.640 --> 17:42.102
-NARRATOR: <i>Yeah. Go on.</i>
-And well, I remember there was grass

17:42.227 --> 17:44.646
and a log and something.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.523
NARRATOR: <i>I'll help you out.</i>
<i>They ate grubs.</i>

17:46.607 --> 17:48.692
(GASPS) Right. Grubs.

17:48.942 --> 17:51.403
Wait, what is a grub?

17:51.653 --> 17:54.531
NARRATOR:<i> Oh, boy.</i>
<i>Looks like we need another visual aid.</i>

18:01.955 --> 18:03.665
Hello, artists!

18:04.708 --> 18:09.546
We have all tried a lot of crazy diets
in our time, but nothing compares

18:09.755 --> 18:13.425
to the diet Simba lived on
when he was feeling "hakuna matata"

18:13.509 --> 18:14.843
with Timon and Pumbaa.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.805
You guys remember what it was, right?

18:17.971 --> 18:19.681
-Oh, yeah. Grubs.
-Grubs.

18:19.890 --> 18:23.018
-You are correct!
-DYLAN: Oh, man. This is exciting.

18:23.143 --> 18:25.020
(CONTESTANTS CHUCKLING)

18:25.145 --> 18:27.064
TATOR: Is that for us or... Wow.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.609
Slimy and satisfying.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.444
(CONTESTANTS CHUCKLING)

18:32.569 --> 18:34.738
Artists, the plot has thickened.

18:38.867 --> 18:41.578
You now need to add
the two most important things

18:41.662 --> 18:43.705
from the Pride Lands
to your foodscapes.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.834
<i>Grass and grubs.</i>

18:47.000 --> 18:50.587
The team to most creatively include
these items in their foodscapes

18:50.754 --> 18:53.715
will have a much better chance
at reigning over us all.

18:54.216 --> 18:57.511
Now, the sun is still on the move,
so get to work.

18:57.594 --> 19:00.973
That tour guide needs us now,
more than ever. Back to the pantry!

19:01.515 --> 19:03.725
-AUSTIN: I gotta get some.
-CHRIS: I'll hang out here.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.561
-(LAUGHS)
-(LAUGHS)

19:06.436 --> 19:09.982
MICHELLE: <i>Oh, yes! All right. So cool.</i>

19:10.232 --> 19:12.734
Oh, my gosh. That's perfect.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.155
-Hey! You ever try these?
-TAMMY: What do you think you are?

19:16.280 --> 19:18.031
-Timon or Pumbaa?
-You want some?

19:18.574 --> 19:20.909
You got a little something in your beard.
Like a little... Yeah.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.245
It's actually delicious. That was amazing.

19:23.495 --> 19:24.746
-TAMMY: Okay.
-DYLAN: Okay.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.082
MICHELLE: <i>This we... I mean,</i>
<i>we could incorporate on the log.</i>

19:27.207 --> 19:29.835
<i>We can use the grubs as cake moss.</i>
<i>We'll color 'em green.</i>

19:29.960 --> 19:32.838
<i>And then for the African grass,</i>
<i>we can use it in the mane for Simba.</i>

19:32.963 --> 19:34.673
-(GASPS) In the mane.
-MICHELLE: And corn silk in the mane.

19:34.756 --> 19:36.341
TAMMY: We may need some of that
for his mane actually...

19:36.425 --> 19:37.885
-Boom. Done.
-Maybe to... Because it's long,

19:38.093 --> 19:39.887
<i>-we can roll it up underneath. Okay.</i>
-DYLAN: <i>Yeah.</i>

19:40.304 --> 19:42.514
-This is exactly what we needed...
-SCHELLIE: Yeah!

19:42.639 --> 19:44.516
-LONDON:<i> Okay.</i>
<i>-...'cause this is perfect for the tail.</i>

19:44.600 --> 19:47.227
-SCHELLIE:<i> Yeah.</i>
-LONDON: <i>And then for Simba,</i>

19:47.352 --> 19:49.855
<i>I'm actually gonna put mealworms</i>
<i>in his mouth, so he's enjoying</i>

19:49.938 --> 19:51.440
<i>the mealworms as he's walking along.</i>

19:51.565 --> 19:53.483
-Yeah. Okay.
-LONDON: That's actually that scene.

19:53.650 --> 19:58.614
I think I got it. We take a little pasta
and we roll it in royal icing,

19:58.739 --> 20:00.115
<i>and then we mix in some grubs,</i>

20:00.199 --> 20:01.450
<i>-drippin' out of his mouth.</i>
-TATOR: <i>Yes.</i>

20:01.533 --> 20:03.160
CHRIS: <i>The grass out of the log</i>
<i>would look great.</i>

20:03.243 --> 20:04.369
<i>-You know what I mean?</i>
-TATOR: <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

20:04.536 --> 20:08.332
I'm still eating the grubs, by the way.
They're still in my mouth.

20:11.418 --> 20:17.758
Currently, I am trying to get
the body covered in chocolate.

20:17.966 --> 20:20.260
All right, you wanna coconut this
or fiber this?

20:20.344 --> 20:21.762
-I'm waiting.
-MICHELLE: Oh.

20:21.845 --> 20:23.680
-DYLAN: It does take it a second.
-MICHELLE: Okay.

20:23.764 --> 20:28.227
DYLAN: <i>I'm working with coconut husk</i>
<i>and it comes compacted in a giant...</i>

20:29.311 --> 20:31.104
<i>brick. And so,</i>
<i>we add a little bit of water</i>

20:31.188 --> 20:34.024
<i>and I'm tryna fluff it up.</i>
<i>I plan to mix some chocolate into it</i>

20:34.149 --> 20:36.401
<i>and use it for the texture on our rock.</i>

20:36.526 --> 20:39.738
My goal is to have
all of our characters done

20:39.947 --> 20:42.115
and then put everything together.

20:42.282 --> 20:44.910
MICHELLE: I keep sayin' "I'll do the body
if she does the face."

20:44.993 --> 20:46.411
I don't understand.

20:48.705 --> 20:50.958
DYLAN: Are you working on the face?
You working on the face?

20:51.083 --> 20:52.251
I'm going to work on the face.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.419
DYLAN: <i>That needs to be</i>
<i>your only focus right now.</i>

20:54.711 --> 20:56.213
-TAMMY: Okay.
-DYLAN: It's your piece.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.757
TAMMY: No, I know.
That's why I'm trying to get it done.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.801
DYLAN: I know,
but Michelle can do the body.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.177
MICHELLE: Yes, I think,
we're pushing the clock.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.137
-Like, if you do the face, we do the body.
-DYLAN: Yeah.

21:04.805 --> 21:08.058
I'm feeling some stress but I know
they know what to do.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.019
We can get this done but we definitely
all have to work together as a team.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.354
TAMMY: That's all right, just go ahead...

21:12.437 --> 21:14.189
-DYLAN: All right. Perfect.
-...so we can get this thing done.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.233
-Yeah, I'll start working on that.
-DYLAN: Sounds good.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.484
TAMMY: Thank you.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.738
TAMMY: <i>At this point right now,</i>
<i>because we're runnin' a little short</i>

21:21.822 --> 21:26.868
<i>on time, all of us can work on Simba</i>
<i>and get him done 'cause he's actually</i>

21:27.077 --> 21:29.496
<i>the most important thing to do</i>
<i>at this point.</i>

21:29.621 --> 21:30.914
DYLAN: I think it's gonna take
way too long

21:30.998 --> 21:32.416
to do the modelling chocolate.

21:32.749 --> 21:34.751
What if we just coat that
in the curry powder on the body?

21:34.835 --> 21:36.086
MICHELLE: It's very possible.

21:37.838 --> 21:43.176
So we decided to use the spices
to just really try a new technique.

21:43.635 --> 21:47.889
<i>I'm using a steamer to make the chocolate</i>
<i>slightly tacky and that way,</i>

21:48.015 --> 21:50.017
<i>when I rub it on, it sticks.</i>

21:50.350 --> 21:52.019
I think it adds a really cool element

21:52.102 --> 21:54.354
and it was a little bit
of a time saver for us.

21:54.855 --> 21:57.482
DYLAN: Tammy, not gonna lie,
he looks super majestic.

21:57.566 --> 21:59.401
-You say congested?
-No, majestic.

21:59.526 --> 22:00.569
-(CHUCKLES)
-(MICHELLE CHUCKLES)

22:00.736 --> 22:02.446
-Like, he looks like the king lion.
-"He looks congested."

22:02.529 --> 22:03.905
DYLAN: He does.

22:07.951 --> 22:09.369
TREY:
Something I can help with right here?

22:09.453 --> 22:10.829
Oh, you can grab some fur.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.081
-Start doin' the same thing I'm doin'.
-TREY: Okay.

22:13.206 --> 22:15.292
TATOR: What I'm doin'
is I'm getting really close,

22:15.375 --> 22:18.920
get a nice coat, and then
you're just gonna take fur and do this.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.839
-TREY: Pat it in there.
-TATOR: Yeah.

22:21.256 --> 22:24.426
Benny mentioned that he could see the seam
in the pasta.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.178
<i>So we wanna cover that seam up</i>

22:26.261 --> 22:28.513
<i>but we wanna make it look</i>
<i>as natural as possible</i>

22:28.597 --> 22:30.515
<i>and what an actual warthog</i>
<i>would look like.</i>

22:30.640 --> 22:34.019
-Maybe leave a little bit of pasta show.
-It's more organic that way, right?

22:34.186 --> 22:36.980
TATOR: <i>Warthogs aren't covered in fur</i>
<i>everywhere. They have patches.</i>

22:37.189 --> 22:39.232
<i>And I've got some tusks</i>
<i>that are both daikon.</i>

22:39.358 --> 22:42.319
Then I've got my isomalt eyes that I made,
and then, you know,

22:42.486 --> 22:43.653
Pumbaa is wrapped up and done.

22:43.737 --> 22:46.073
CHRIS: I gotta be honest, I did not think
it would look that good.

22:46.156 --> 22:48.742
-Sweet. I'm excited, bro.
-Yeah. It's awesome.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.703
-TATOR: Now that's teamwork right there.
-It is coming together.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.955
You know, I appreciate you guys
bringing me with you.

22:54.081 --> 22:56.708
Like, this has been a super good learning
experience for me.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.251
-TREY: Honestly.
-This is great.

22:58.418 --> 23:02.381
Getting the opportunity to work with Trey
on Disney is basically a dream come true.

23:02.464 --> 23:03.882
-Easy. Just... yeah.
-Dab and brush.

23:03.965 --> 23:05.133
Dab and brush. That's it.

23:05.258 --> 23:07.636
It's absolutely awesome.
I wouldn't trade it for the world.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.262
TATOR: I'm really excited to see

23:09.388 --> 23:11.306
the judges' expression
when they see this finished.

23:11.473 --> 23:12.849
TREY: If they're not excited,
they're lion.

23:12.974 --> 23:15.602
-TATOR: (CHUCKLING) They're lion.
-(CHRIS CHUCKLING)

23:16.061 --> 23:18.355
All right, I'm doing the last pastas
real quick.

23:18.438 --> 23:23.652
<i>So I'm working out, like, the best way</i>
<i>to cover the seams a little bit for Simba.</i>

23:23.985 --> 23:25.570
<i>What I was thinking was a meringue</i>

23:25.695 --> 23:29.658
with the semolina in it to get the tone
and then go ahead and blot it in.

23:30.784 --> 23:31.785
Look at that.

23:31.868 --> 23:36.373
<i>So, now, I've gotten these little patches</i>
<i>of, like, fluff to kinda hide the seams.</i>

23:36.456 --> 23:37.707
It's a pretty big one.

23:37.916 --> 23:40.419
<i>It's giving me a little bit of trouble</i>
<i>just trying to pull it off</i>

23:40.585 --> 23:43.588
in the medium that I'm not used to.
But nothing is more important

23:43.672 --> 23:48.093
in this whole storyline than Simba.
And trying to replicate what we see

23:48.176 --> 23:49.428
in those images of Disney.

23:49.636 --> 23:51.763
SCHELLIE: All right, I'm gonna start
on this side of the log.

23:53.849 --> 23:58.562
<i>We're using chocolate buttercream</i>
<i>to create this beautiful rustic log.</i>

23:58.979 --> 24:00.647
-I love that, Schellie.
-Yeah.

24:00.772 --> 24:04.192
Then I'm gonna do that notches and sap
but I just wanna get a fair amount.

24:05.610 --> 24:06.820
LONDON: He looks awful.

24:07.737 --> 24:09.573
Are you feeling okay?

24:09.698 --> 24:11.450
-LONDON: No.
-AUSTIN: What looks awful?

24:11.950 --> 24:13.201
LONDON: Simba.

24:13.326 --> 24:15.454
He does not look awful,
he looks phenomenal...

24:15.620 --> 24:17.205
-SCHELLIE: Yeah.
-...it looks great, London.

24:18.415 --> 24:19.666
I'm not too sure about this.

24:19.749 --> 24:21.251
-It's looking good, London.
-LONDON: It's the biggest thing

24:21.334 --> 24:22.544
-I've ever made.
-It really is.

24:22.919 --> 24:26.465
Schellie, just think how far we've come
since I was your TA.

24:26.715 --> 24:30.302
Well, yeah. London's come quite far
since she was a sophomore.

24:30.385 --> 24:32.888
-LONDON: I've come really far today.
-Yes, you have.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.849
KEKE: <i>Let's look at our Storytellers.</i>

24:36.016 --> 24:38.518
Did you notice
that their second character, Timon...

24:38.602 --> 24:40.437
-KEKE: <i>Yes. They haven't started on...</i>
<i>-...he hasn't even began.</i>

24:40.520 --> 24:43.732
AMIRAH: <i>When you're working with such</i>
<i>a small character next to a big character,</i>

24:43.982 --> 24:46.610
you really have to come in so strong
with the details,

24:46.735 --> 24:49.029
<i>otherwise,</i>
<i>just gonna look like another shrub</i>

24:49.112 --> 24:50.113
-or a bug on there.
-Yeah.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.283
Come on, buddy. You got to get rollin'.

24:53.366 --> 24:56.328
<i>I'm nervous about finishing Simba.</i>
<i>I just want his details</i>

24:56.411 --> 24:59.456
<i>and his features to be correct.</i>
<i>But also I have to move on to Timon.</i>

24:59.581 --> 25:02.584
'Cause the sun's going down,
and we don't have a lot of time.

25:02.667 --> 25:04.127
AUSTIN: Do you need
to start working on his mane?

25:04.211 --> 25:05.962
-Yeah.
-AUSTIN: I'll help finish Simba

25:06.046 --> 25:08.340
-and London, you do Timon.
-LONDON: Yeah.

25:08.465 --> 25:10.300
-Here you go.
-LONDON: Okay.

25:10.383 --> 25:12.177
-So, does this matter if it overlaps?
-No, it doesn't.

25:12.344 --> 25:15.222
-AUSTIN: Okay, I'll get this done.
-LONDON: Okay. Oh, my gosh.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.934
DYLAN: The main thing
is just finishing up Simba.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.727
-TAMMY: I'm done on the back.
-DYLAN: All right, I can do all this.

25:20.852 --> 25:22.020
Let's get to the mane.

25:22.103 --> 25:24.606
Hang on. I would like to start doing
the corn silk right now

25:24.731 --> 25:27.025
and do the eyes and the nose
and stuff here in a minute.

25:27.108 --> 25:29.861
Well, I have to start finishing the tree
and the mountain,

25:30.070 --> 25:31.238
-so I'm gonna air...
-Do the broccoli?

25:31.613 --> 25:35.700
DYLAN:<i> Tammy's still working on the lion,</i>
<i>so I need to put this tree up now.</i>

25:35.867 --> 25:37.911
-We just gotta get Simba done.
-TAMMY: Yeah.

25:37.994 --> 25:39.371
-Simba. Simba, Simba, Simba.
-TAMMY: Of course.

25:39.454 --> 25:41.248
-I know this.
-DYLAN: Just make sure Simba gets done.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.666
It doesn't look right. Does it?

25:42.916 --> 25:44.584
MICHELLE: I think, actually,
it's pretty cool.

25:44.709 --> 25:45.794
-Do you?
-MICHELLE: Yeah.

25:45.919 --> 25:48.922
TAMMY: <i>We're using this African grass</i>
<i>for the mane.</i>

25:49.047 --> 25:52.634
It's not very flimsy.
I guess we could just do it.

25:53.134 --> 25:55.887
-See, how it goes.
-DYLAN: I like that idea. Just do it.

25:56.179 --> 25:59.641
There are some issues with weight
and structure.

25:59.724 --> 26:03.645
<i>So we do have to make sure</i>
<i>that the top is stable enough</i>

26:03.728 --> 26:05.689
<i>to be able to get the details</i>
<i>that we want.</i>

26:06.022 --> 26:09.109
It's crazy how green that mane is,
but I know we're gonna airbrush it.

26:09.192 --> 26:10.360
No, I'm not airbrushing it.

26:10.443 --> 26:11.653
-DYLAN: You're gonna leave it green?
-Yeah.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.489
'Cause the grass had the green in it,
I thought it was kinda neat.

26:18.243 --> 26:20.662
Hey guys, the sun's going down.
We need to start tying it all together

26:20.787 --> 26:22.747
and getting it finished. We can do it.

26:22.872 --> 26:24.207
CHRIS: Work faster. Check.

TATOR:<i> I'm gettin' ready for the pour</i>
<i>on the river.</i>

26:30.839 --> 26:32.132
I think, in the front edge,

26:32.215 --> 26:34.426
-I'm ready to pour some clear isomalt.
-Yeah.

26:34.718 --> 26:38.513
TATOR: <i>Isomalt is a sugar substitute</i>
<i>that's pulled out of beets.</i>

26:38.722 --> 26:40.724
<i>It's a lot more versatile than sugar.</i>

26:40.807 --> 26:41.808
Here goes nothing.

26:42.517 --> 26:45.103
That looks perfect. All right.

26:46.187 --> 26:49.941
<i>I'm experimenting with the colors.</i>
<i>What it'll do is it'll make it swirl</i>

26:50.108 --> 26:52.736
<i>and bubble,</i>
<i>so it's gonna give it a good effect.</i>

26:53.737 --> 26:55.989

that clear looks in the middle

26:56.072 --> 26:57.991

27:25.143 --> 27:28.605
So, what I'm gonna do is just build up
his body with cake pops,

27:28.688 --> 27:30.940
then cover it in modeling chocolate.
I'm just gonna sculpt him

27:31.024 --> 27:34.569
the same way I did Simba.
But in, like, a quarter of the time.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.113
AUSTIN: London, it's just
kind of a wild hairdo, right?

27:37.280 --> 27:39.824
Yeah. Move that one.
Just because it looks kind of awkward.

27:39.949 --> 27:41.117
That one, right there, yeah.

27:41.201 --> 27:42.911
And we can kind of put one, like,
maybe down...

27:46.206 --> 27:48.375

some coconut fiber.

27:48.583 --> 27:49.751
We put some dye in here.

27:49.876 --> 27:52.462

<i>of pasta, add in the bugs.</i>

AMIRAH: I love that you chose to use
the grass and incorporate it into the mane

32:09.886 --> 32:12.722
because it is giving me two very
different textures

32:12.847 --> 32:16.517

of what a lion would naturally have.

32:16.893 --> 32:17.894
Yeah.

The issue that I have with him is,
I see green hair.

AMIRAH: I would have dyed the hair.

For grass, we actually infused it
into Simba's tail...

34:26.147 --> 34:28.691
<i>so it has like a nice little furry plume</i>
<i>over there.</i>

34:28.858 --> 34:31.360
<i>And then for the grubs,</i>
<i>we kind of littered them across the log.</i>

34:31.486 --> 34:33.613

<i>have some in Timon's hand,</i>

35:03.893 --> 35:07.897
AMIRAH: <i>The expression in their faces,</i>
<i>they are representative of that moment</i>

35:07.980 --> 35:11.400
<i>of his adolescent life. Simba is giving us</i>
<i>this teenage vibe</i>

35:11.484 --> 35:14.153
<i>and when you look at Timon,</i>
<i>he's really looking at him like,</i>

35:14.237 --> 35:15.613
<i>"Boy, you got a lot to learn." So...</i>

35:15.780 --> 35:16.948

<i>The body is a little bit in disproportion.</i>

35:23.579 --> 35:25.456

<i>the colors that were used,</i>

the beautiful tricks and carving
vegetables and fruits.

35:32.213 --> 35:35.299
Now, the grass, I like the fact
that you used them on the tail.

35:35.424 --> 35:38.261
It's giving you a clean
and fluffy texture.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.972
I would love to dive
into how they created the water.

35:41.097 --> 35:44.642
BENNY: <i>The decision to add the layers</i>
<i>of piping gel on top of the buttercream</i>

35:44.725 --> 35:46.811
<i>is great because it gives you</i>
<i>that shiny look of the water.</i>

35:46.936 --> 35:49.230
If you had just the buttercream,
it will be a little be flat in it.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.149
KEKE: Yeah, and not see as much motion.

35:51.274 --> 35:54.443
AMIRAH: <i>Let's talk about the tree,</i>
<i>'cause I think that the micro sponging,</i>

35:54.527 --> 35:56.529
<i>it's really exciting,</i>
<i>because it's a different technique</i>

35:56.612 --> 35:58.239
<i>that is sort of twisting and leaning.</i>

35:58.406 --> 36:02.785

together. One of the cool things

36:19.051 --> 36:22.221
for me is even though Tator and I
are the experienced artists,

36:22.430 --> 36:25.766
Trey actually, he put in literally a third
of the work.

36:25.933 --> 36:29.604
He's growning up pretty fast,
and seeing what he's capable of doing now,

36:29.812 --> 36:31.606
it's just an eye-opening experience.

36:31.731 --> 36:34.692
In the beginning of this,
I had no idea where it was gonna go.

36:34.775 --> 36:38.988
And every step of it, I was learning.
And so, I'm just genuinely happy.

36:39.155 --> 36:41.824
Well, all right.
Walk us through your foodscape.

36:43.409 --> 36:46.245
CHRIS: <i>Our foodscape, we're helping</i>
<i>the tour guide tell the story</i>

36:46.329 --> 36:50.041
<i>of young Simba and Pumbaa,</i>
<i>who actually is a father figure to him.</i>

36:50.166 --> 36:53.211
<i>For us, like, the key piece</i>
<i>of that was super playful.</i>

36:53.377 --> 36:56.214
<i>Simba's kinda, like, nippin' at the tail</i>
<i>saying, "Hey, let's stop</i>

36:56.297 --> 37:00.051
<i>"and play for a minute." So, for Simba,</i>
<i>I made a semolina egg pasta.</i>

37:00.176 --> 37:04.555
<i>For Simba's fur, we have a layering</i>
<i>of pasta sheets and then a texture</i>

37:04.680 --> 37:07.516
<i>with meringue</i>
<i>and it's sprinkling on semolina.</i>

37:07.642 --> 37:11.187
TATOR: <i>The tails are coconut fiber,</i>
<i>and then we also have the isomalt eyes</i>

37:11.312 --> 37:15.066
<i>with the edible wafer paper inside.</i>
<i>With Pumbaa, the main structure</i>

37:15.149 --> 37:17.068
<i>is bread baguettes all throughout the body</i>

37:17.193 --> 37:19.237
<i>to build up</i>
<i>the muscle structure underneath.</i>

37:19.362 --> 37:21.864
<i>And then the chocolate pasta, of course,</i>
<i>on the outside.</i>

37:21.989 --> 37:24.992
<i>We have the black squid ink pasta</i>
<i>that's wrapped around the hooves.</i>

37:25.117 --> 37:30.164
<i>The tusks are both daikon.</i>
<i>The tongue itself is gum paste and pasta.</i>

37:30.456 --> 37:33.918
The whiskers
are the grass dipped in isomalt

37:34.126 --> 37:36.170
<i>and then we also have the grass</i>
<i>in the logs.</i>

37:36.337 --> 37:38.130
CHRIS: <i>And then we did bring in the sweet</i>
<i>with the river.</i>

37:38.214 --> 37:42.301
<i>Tator poured out this isomalt river</i>
<i>for us, you know, and Trey made the rocks</i>

37:42.385 --> 37:45.096
<i>to go around that. The grubs</i>
<i>were a great addition to Pumbaa.</i>

37:45.221 --> 37:48.307
<i>You know, we made this big,</i>
<i>drooling grub slime</i>

37:48.391 --> 37:50.476
<i>coming out of his mouth. It's really cool.</i>

37:50.601 --> 37:52.770
You had young Simba.
To me, that's my favorite.

37:52.937 --> 37:57.400
<i>Because he's so playful,</i>
<i>and this is just such a great story.</i>

37:57.566 --> 37:59.568
<i>I have never in my life seen</i>

37:59.652 --> 38:03.739
<i>complete art created</i>
<i>from freshly made pasta,</i>

38:03.823 --> 38:06.325
colored with other foods.
This is avant-garde.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.911
-Thank you.
-This is a beautiful display, guys.

38:09.078 --> 38:12.164
<i>I love the log. I love the way</i>
<i>that you guys used the bread</i>

38:12.248 --> 38:15.793
to create texture. Now, I know you guys
were working with pasta

38:15.918 --> 38:17.044
and I love the technique.

38:17.211 --> 38:21.924
Well, I have to say that Pumbaa's fur...
it's really looking awesome.

38:22.008 --> 38:25.428
<i>I really love the actual techniques.</i>
<i>Simba seems a little off.</i>

38:26.012 --> 38:28.306
<i>Some areas</i>
<i>is still not blended completely,</i>

38:28.389 --> 38:29.598
<i>so I see the seams.</i>

38:30.349 --> 38:33.269
So, if I take Simba out of this log,

38:33.477 --> 38:35.980
would people recognize
that he's actually Simba?

38:36.105 --> 38:38.524
-Got ya.
-BENNY: When working with Disney,

38:38.607 --> 38:42.320
we have to stay as close as possible
to the original character.

38:42.486 --> 38:45.072
Amirah, I know you feel differently.
So I wanna hear

38:45.197 --> 38:47.783
-what you have to say on that.
-This is an art show. This is art.

38:48.743 --> 38:52.038
You know, you explored a material in a way
that I've never seen used before.

38:52.121 --> 38:54.457
It definitely inspired me

38:54.623 --> 38:55.791
-so, so much.
-Inspired me too.

38:56.334 --> 38:59.712
I mean, literally, blown away by some
of the things and the choices

38:59.795 --> 39:01.756
that you guys have done creatively here.

39:01.922 --> 39:03.632
-It's a fun piece.
-It's very fun.

39:03.716 --> 39:04.967
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

39:06.510 --> 39:08.262
This is hard, right?
'Cause all of them did

39:08.346 --> 39:10.348
<i>-such beautiful jobs in their own way.</i>
-AMIRAH: <i>Yes.</i>

39:10.681 --> 39:13.184
<i>I love the fur that they did on Pumbaa.</i>

39:13.267 --> 39:17.021
BENNY: <i>The only issue that I have is just</i>
<i>the texture of the actual Simba body.</i>

39:17.355 --> 39:18.981
KEKE: <i>I love Simba's face</i>
<i>from Storytellers.</i>

39:19.106 --> 39:21.525
<i>-London is talented as all get out.</i>
-BENNY:<i> Yeah.</i>

39:21.609 --> 39:24.528
-AMIRAH: <i>She is so good at faces.</i>
-KEKE: <i>She is... That face...</i>

39:24.612 --> 39:25.571
AMIRAH: <i>It's Simba.</i>

39:26.030 --> 39:28.741
BENNY: <i>The Ladies and the Champs,</i>
<i>they didn't color the hair, you know,</i>

39:28.824 --> 39:31.369
<i>but they had the best fur and Simba.</i>

39:31.452 --> 39:33.579
-Are we clear on what we want?
-Yes.

39:34.622 --> 39:35.748
Let's go.

39:39.126 --> 39:42.004
-Here we go.
-Look at the castle. Aw!

39:42.254 --> 39:43.214
This is cool.

39:43.714 --> 39:45.508
It's gonna be all right no matter what.

39:46.050 --> 39:52.098
As you can tell, we love your creations.
But only one can win.

39:56.185 --> 39:57.728
Oh, that is awesome.

39:59.980 --> 40:01.065
It's pretty cool.

40:01.315 --> 40:07.279
The team that created
the most Foodtastic Simba and friend is…

40:09.949 --> 40:11.075
Oh, my God.

40:11.367 --> 40:13.369
-(LAUGHING) That's awesome!
-TREY: Now this is... this is in slow-mo.

40:14.662 --> 40:15.704
What?

40:24.004 --> 40:25.548
Storytellers!

40:25.631 --> 40:26.799
-(CHEER)
-(CHEER)

40:27.007 --> 40:30.219
Please come up
and receive your <i>Foodtastic</i> pins.

40:30.886 --> 40:32.555
-That is awesome.
-Oh, my God.

40:32.847 --> 40:35.433
-SCHELLIE: Thank you.
-Please, please, put them on. Please.

40:35.558 --> 40:36.976
My hands are shaking too much.

40:37.476 --> 40:38.894
-How do you guys feel?
-SCHELLIE: Ah!

40:39.061 --> 40:40.938
-Awesome...
-Such a relief.

40:41.021 --> 40:42.148
...and amazing.

40:42.606 --> 40:44.608
AUSTIN: <i>I couldn't be more proud</i>
<i>of what we created.</i>

40:44.733 --> 40:46.193
<i>I think we did a fantastic job.</i>

40:46.360 --> 40:49.029
SCHELLIE: <i>I just wanna say</i>
<i>thank you for saying, "Yes."</i>

40:49.113 --> 40:51.824
I could not have asked
for two more amazing students.

40:51.949 --> 40:53.576
Schellie, I think we wanna say,

40:53.701 --> 40:56.287
-"thank you" for bringing us.
-Thank you. Yeah, for bringing us.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.999
Well, you guys, please come up here
and join us because we loved

41:00.082 --> 41:01.125
your foodscapes too.

41:01.500 --> 41:06.005
To have Benny just compliment me
so much on the faces really means a lot.

41:06.172 --> 41:07.798
I'm still having class with you.

41:07.882 --> 41:11.552
LONDON:<i> It's like my dream.</i>
<i>So, this has put me over the moon.</i>

41:11.677 --> 41:14.388
-Good job, Schellie. Congratulations.
-Thank you, Tator. Aw.

41:14.722 --> 41:16.348
I'm so proud of you.

41:17.099 --> 41:19.685
Remember,
never stop playing with your food.

41:20.519 --> 41:23.981
NARRATOR:<i> As celebrations continue,</i>
<i>let's check in with our tour guide.</i>

41:25.649 --> 41:29.987
And so, Simba found his place
atop Pride Rock,

41:30.404 --> 41:33.324
the rightful King of the Pride Land.

41:33.407 --> 41:36.452
NARRATOR: <i>There you go. And you found</i>
<i>your place as a master tour guide.</i>

41:36.535 --> 41:40.539
I did it. Though I have to admit,
I would have never been able to do it

41:40.706 --> 41:42.416
-without your help.
-NARRATOR: <i>Nah! We're all better</i>

41:42.500 --> 41:46.295
<i>-because we've got each other.</i>
-Oh! It's like, I'm there for my friends

41:46.420 --> 41:49.465
and my friends are there for me,
like a circle.

41:49.548 --> 41:52.009
-NARRATOR:<i> Exactly.</i>
-That's a great lesson.

41:52.176 --> 41:54.136
They should have put that
in <i>The Lion King.</i>

41:54.220 --> 41:56.055
NARRATOR: <i>That's literally</i>
<i>what the movie is about.</i>

41:56.138 --> 41:59.600
(CHUCKLES) Oh, you're right.
Man, you're really smart...

42:00.100 --> 42:05.731
The circle of life. (GASPS) Wow.
Oh, wait, like the song. I get it now.

42:05.814 --> 42:07.733
NARRATOR: (CHUCKLING) <i>Hakuna matata.</i>
