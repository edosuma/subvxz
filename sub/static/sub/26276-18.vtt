Come here, lads!

00:38.429 --> 00:39.865
I think they finally got wise
and ran away.

00:39.909 --> 00:41.780
The lads have been
gone for two hours.

00:41.824 --> 00:43.826
They've never run away
like this before.

Magnum, what are you doing?

00:47.221 --> 00:49.745
Surf ski's getting repaired.
Didn't want to skip a workout.

00:49.788 --> 00:51.486
A rowing machine
next to the ocean?

00:51.529 --> 00:54.097
That's rather redundant,
don't you think?

00:54.141 --> 00:55.359
[chuckles]It's like a treadmill

00:55.403 --> 00:56.926

00:56.969 --> 01:00.669
Or a... a head of security

Hold on,
did you have something to do

01:03.759 --> 01:04.934

01:04.977 --> 01:07.067
I'm offended
you would even think that.

01:08.198 --> 01:10.200
No, I had nothing to do
with their disappearance.

01:10.244 --> 01:12.202
But I can actually help you
find them. I don't know

01:12.246 --> 01:14.074
if you know this,
but I'm really good

01:14.117 --> 01:16.076
at tracking down missing pets.

01:16.119 --> 01:18.121

Oh, yes.

01:24.171 --> 01:25.215
Laugh all you want,

01:25.259 --> 01:26.695
but that case
helped solve a murder

01:26.738 --> 01:29.306
and returned a little girl's
favorite pet to her.

01:29.350 --> 01:31.743
Now, do you want my help or not?

01:31.787 --> 01:33.136
$550's my normal rate,

01:33.180 --> 01:34.659
but for you, $475.

01:34.703 --> 01:36.661
It's a friends

It's a limited-time offer,
so chop-chop, as you'd say.

Fine.

You saw them coming

Yeah.Could be from a bullet.

Or not.

02:11.827 --> 02:15.439
No. My gut says foul play.

02:15.483 --> 02:17.702
Maybe the lads just
dug up a grave.

02:17.746 --> 02:19.487
And opened up
a sealed coffin?

02:19.530 --> 02:21.402
I don't think so.

There's no catch.

Attagirl.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.455
You know,

04:41.498 --> 04:44.196
it's not really a compliment
if you make somebody say it.

True, but having the M.E.
confirm my suspicions,

04:46.677 --> 04:48.375

that I'm right

04:48.418 --> 04:50.115
is immensely satisfying.

It just leaves
two questions.

Whose tibia was it,
and, actually,

04:54.424 --> 04:55.730
how on earth do you know where
Zeus and Apollo found it?

Well, it's simple.

04:57.253 --> 04:58.950
They weren't gone long, so
they couldn't have gone far.

04:58.994 --> 05:00.517
Secondly, they were eating
rambutan berries,

05:00.561 --> 05:02.780

in these woods.

Oh, my God, you didn't.

05:08.046 --> 05:09.613
Yeah, I did.

05:09.657 --> 05:12.181
You examined
the lads' excrement.

05:12.224 --> 05:14.488
Proper terminology
is "poop."

And there's a bullet
lodged in its skull.

05:44.735 --> 05:47.129
The bone Zeus found
was, was human.

05:47.172 --> 05:49.131
Perhaps the tibia belonged
to the dog's owner.

05:49.174 --> 05:51.307
Might be
something else in here.

Yeah.

my area of expertise.

Yeah, like that's ever
stopped you.

Yeah. Titanium.

So, Gina, how long's it been
since you saw your daughter?

07:43.637 --> 07:45.073
GINA:
Uh, a while.

07:46.291 --> 07:47.554
Not since I left the Island,

Well, not with her so much
as with my ex.

You may have heard of him.
His name is Eddie Harada.

07:59.522 --> 08:02.699
Wait, yakuza Eddie Harada?

08:02.743 --> 08:05.006
I turned state's evidence
against him,

08:05.049 --> 08:06.747
and he went away.

08:06.790 --> 08:08.792
I went into witness protection.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.664
Yakuza's reach can be
pretty long,

safer if she wasn't with me.

about your visit?

some kind of accident.

he had her cuffed.

His gun never cleared
his holster.

And he never once said
"I told you so."

how to do this job.

12:26.354 --> 12:29.226
Your friend have
his own language?

12:30.227 --> 12:32.360
Uh, it's shorthand.

12:32.403 --> 12:34.754
He didn't like
to waste time.

12:38.148 --> 12:39.367
HENNY: What can I do for you?Sorry for your loss,

12:39.410 --> 12:41.412
ma'am.
Lieutenant Akana.That's my boss.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.590
Why don't
we speak inside, ma'am?

12:45.634 --> 12:46.983
Detective.

12:47.027 --> 12:48.332
I'm really sorry about Tak.

12:48.376 --> 12:49.769
I know you two were close.

12:49.812 --> 12:52.249
But you know
you can't work this case.

12:52.293 --> 12:54.469
Detective Palea
will take it from here.

12:54.512 --> 12:55.992
Sir, you don't have to worry

12:56.036 --> 12:57.428
about my emotions
getting in the way.

12:57.472 --> 12:58.647
Really?

12:58.690 --> 13:00.344
You have vacation time.

13:00.388 --> 13:01.519
Take it.

13:01.563 --> 13:02.433
Grieve.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.522
After you, ma'am.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.833
[auto-dialing]

13:10.877 --> 13:12.356
[line ringing]

13:12.400 --> 13:15.011
Yeah, I need a cab
at 1634 Maunaloa.

13:15.055 --> 13:17.318
[beep]You're gonna listen to this guy?

13:17.361 --> 13:19.537
Unlike you, when I'm given an
order by someone in authority,

13:19.581 --> 13:20.451
I obey it.

13:22.323 --> 13:23.890
Go home, Magnum.
We're done here.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.692
[car door opens]

13:49.132 --> 13:51.265
Why did you bring me here?

13:51.308 --> 13:52.440
She's your mother, honey.

13:52.483 --> 13:54.268
My mother?

13:54.311 --> 13:55.965
No, you raised me.

13:56.009 --> 13:58.402
I don't know who
this person is.

13:58.446 --> 14:01.057
Sweetheart, just,
please let me explain.

14:01.101 --> 14:02.493
Just hear her out.

14:04.017 --> 14:06.584
[laughs softly]:
Look at you.

14:06.628 --> 14:08.804
The last time I saw you...

14:08.848 --> 14:10.371
I was six.

14:10.414 --> 14:12.895
Where were you when I was
12 and I had pneumonia?

14:12.939 --> 14:14.505
When I met my husband?

14:14.549 --> 14:15.811
When we got divorced?

14:16.856 --> 14:19.119
I needed you then.

14:19.162 --> 14:21.861
I don't need you now.

14:27.127 --> 14:29.346
She needs time,

14:29.390 --> 14:31.653
to process.

14:34.482 --> 14:35.613
Your friend's right.

14:35.657 --> 14:37.311
It's got to be a lot
for her to handle.

14:37.354 --> 14:39.574
[car door opens]You think?

14:40.575 --> 14:42.403
[car door closes]

14:44.622 --> 14:45.972
MAGNUM:
Two names.

14:46.015 --> 14:47.669
That's what Stanley wrote
on his notepad?

14:47.712 --> 14:49.323
HIGGINS:
Yes.

14:49.366 --> 14:50.977
Although you could have told me
that Katsumoto was off the case

14:51.020 --> 14:54.154
before I became an expert
in translating shorthand.

14:54.197 --> 14:55.677
Sorry about that.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.157
How is he?

14:57.200 --> 14:57.984
Not great.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.463
So, who's

14:59.507 --> 15:02.858
Mike Trevino
and Justin "J.T." Kalua?

15:02.902 --> 15:05.339
All I know is that they both
attended Kuwili High School,

15:05.382 --> 15:07.080
class of 2012.

15:07.123 --> 15:10.953
I suppose it doesn't matter now.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.520
Wait, you're gonna
keep working on this?

15:14.130 --> 15:16.350
Never mind. I know the answer.

15:18.352 --> 15:20.093
Thank you, Higgy.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.099
[knocking on door]

15:27.361 --> 15:28.753
What are you doing here?

15:28.797 --> 15:31.234
Higgins deciphered the page
from Stanley's notepad.

15:31.278 --> 15:32.844
Thought you might want the info,
considering

15:32.888 --> 15:35.064
he may have been killed over
whatever he was looking into.

15:35.108 --> 15:36.805
I'm off the case, Magnum.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.982
What are you doing?What are you hiding?

15:42.158 --> 15:44.987
[chuckles]:
You stole the files.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.902
Stanley would be proud.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.773
Why didn't you tell me
you're still working the case?

15:48.817 --> 15:51.385
I'll risk my badge. I won't
put anyone else on the line.

15:51.428 --> 15:53.256
You can go now.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.302
So you don't want the info?

15:55.345 --> 15:57.260
It's just a couple of names.

15:57.304 --> 15:59.175
I can decipher
the shorthand myself.

15:59.219 --> 16:01.090
You'll have a lead in 2023.

16:01.134 --> 16:02.135
It's not your problem.

16:02.178 --> 16:03.353
I disagree.

16:03.397 --> 16:05.181
Look, there's probably,
I don't know,

16:05.225 --> 16:07.705
more than 400 times where
it was not in your best interest

16:07.749 --> 16:09.925
to help me, yet you still did.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.100
This is different.

16:11.144 --> 16:12.536
An unsanctioned investigation

16:12.580 --> 16:14.495
could ruin the case
when the killer is apprehended.

16:14.538 --> 16:16.323
Yeah, that's exactly
why you need me.

16:16.366 --> 16:18.716
I'm a private citizen, okay?
I can do things you can't.

16:18.760 --> 16:21.415
That's the only way you can
work this: use me as a proxy.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.504
Why do you want to help?
So I can owe you a favor?

16:23.547 --> 16:24.940
Come on, that's low.

16:24.984 --> 16:25.941
Quid pro quo's
your middle name.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.421
Yeah, not this time.

16:27.464 --> 16:30.206
All right, look, I've, I've been
in your position before.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.425
What position's that?

16:31.468 --> 16:34.036
Where some jerk tells you
to stand down.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.603
Hey, usually that's me.

16:35.646 --> 16:39.999
Yeah, but I also know what
it's like to lose someone close.

16:42.131 --> 16:46.527
I'm offering to help you
for the first time, like, ever.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.094
Let me.

16:48.137 --> 16:50.835
[phone ringing]

16:53.795 --> 16:55.318
Look, I need
to answer this.

16:55.362 --> 16:56.537
Don't say anything
until I get off.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.843
You got it, Gordy.Katsumoto here.

16:58.887 --> 17:01.629
CUNHA [over phone]:
Got an update on the Tak case.Great.

17:01.672 --> 17:04.066
I would put Stanley's death
at about five years ago.

17:04.110 --> 17:06.373
C.O.D. was a GSW to the chest.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.418
Ballistics confirms
the same nine-mil

17:08.462 --> 17:10.768
was used to kill both
Stanley and his dog.

17:10.812 --> 17:12.074
And Stanley and Ralph,

17:12.118 --> 17:13.293
they were buried
out in the middle of nowhere.

17:13.336 --> 17:16.557
I'm thinking that was
just the dump site.

17:16.600 --> 17:17.993
Hey, Noelani,

17:18.037 --> 17:20.343
any, uh, idea where
the primary crime scene was?

17:20.387 --> 17:22.737
Magnum? I didn't know
you were there.

17:22.780 --> 17:25.740
Katsumoto didn't tell you?
We're partners now.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.221
Sorry.

17:28.264 --> 17:30.353
Um, only other evidence

17:30.397 --> 17:32.964
is sand and a cluster
of dead mosquitoes

17:33.008 --> 17:34.792
at the bottom
of Stanley's boots.

17:34.836 --> 17:36.620
Stanley liked to walk Ralph on
the beach, which would explain

17:36.664 --> 17:38.970
the sand,
and mosquitoes like water.

17:39.014 --> 17:40.537
What kind of mosquitoes?

17:40.581 --> 17:41.756
You know, different insects
hang out on different parts

17:41.799 --> 17:43.366
of the Island, so it could help

17:43.410 --> 17:45.412
track Stanley's movements
before he was killed.

17:45.455 --> 17:46.761
Wow.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.197
That actually makes sense.

17:48.241 --> 17:49.720
I'll look into it.

17:49.764 --> 17:51.287
I'll call you
if there's any updates.

17:51.331 --> 17:53.028
Bye.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.203
Put that back.

17:54.247 --> 17:55.683
Who's this?

17:55.726 --> 17:57.337
It's my son.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.252
He lives on the North Shore
with my ex-wife.

17:59.295 --> 18:03.299
Wow, Gordy, you are just
full of surprises.

18:03.343 --> 18:05.345
You call me that again,
and no one will find yourbody.

18:05.388 --> 18:06.650
[laughs softly]
You forgot

18:06.694 --> 18:09.088
to tell Noelani you're
not working the case.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.264
Just give me the damn names.

18:12.308 --> 18:15.006
Please.

18:15.050 --> 18:16.573
You got it, partner.

18:16.617 --> 18:19.228
CLERK [over P.A.]:
Order number 14?

18:19.272 --> 18:22.231
Order number 14.

18:22.275 --> 18:23.493
Thank you.

18:29.456 --> 18:31.197
RICK:
Nice work, buddy,
nice work.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.763
Nice work?
Want to help me with this?

18:32.807 --> 18:34.156
[Gina chuckles]

18:34.200 --> 18:35.331
Give you a hand.

18:35.375 --> 18:37.768
Thanks for, uh, for
bringing me here.

18:37.812 --> 18:41.120
Been craving their
loco moco for 20 years.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.860
You mind if I ask you something?

18:42.904 --> 18:44.688
Yeah.

18:44.732 --> 18:48.518
You know, why, why come back
now, after all these years?

18:48.562 --> 18:50.825
Why not sooner?GINA:
Well,

18:50.868 --> 18:54.394
I was afraid of disrupting
Kelsey's life, you know?

18:54.437 --> 18:55.786
Reopening old wounds.

18:55.830 --> 18:58.833
I guess I figured there
would always be time.

18:58.876 --> 19:01.836
Couple months ago,
I had a cancer scare

19:01.879 --> 19:05.448
and I realized
there might not be.

19:06.493 --> 19:08.277
So, when you took off,

19:08.321 --> 19:09.887
you didn't explain to her
why you were leaving?

19:10.932 --> 19:13.674
Well, I was going to,

19:13.717 --> 19:17.156
but, you know,
she was so young.

19:19.201 --> 19:20.376
[clears throat]

19:20.420 --> 19:21.595
I'll be back.

19:21.638 --> 19:23.249
Need to use the ladies'.I'll go with you.

19:23.292 --> 19:25.512
Oh, no, no, no, I got it.
It's right on the corner.

19:25.555 --> 19:26.774
I'll be in and out.All right.

19:26.817 --> 19:29.429
Keep your head down.Okay.

19:32.562 --> 19:34.521
What?

19:36.653 --> 19:38.220
I didn't say nothing.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.831
You think she handled it wrong.

19:41.876 --> 19:43.834
Look, I get it was dangerous.

19:43.878 --> 19:46.402
But she could've taken
Kelsey with her.

19:46.446 --> 19:49.362
I mean, at the very least,
said something before she left.

19:49.405 --> 19:51.929
Well, come on, man,
you heard her. Kelsey was young.

19:51.973 --> 19:54.323
Yeah, or it was easier
to take off.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.803
That way she didn't have to see

19:55.846 --> 19:57.979
any of the pain or hurt
she was causing.

19:58.022 --> 20:01.896
Buddy, Gina is not your mom.

20:01.939 --> 20:04.246
This ain't about my mom.

20:06.509 --> 20:08.337
Okay, maybe a little.

20:08.381 --> 20:10.339
We have no idea
what it was like for her.

20:10.383 --> 20:11.514
You know? She probably thought

20:11.558 --> 20:13.429
she was doing right
by her daughter.

20:13.473 --> 20:17.172
Yeah, well, you ask me,
she was doing the opposite.

20:18.956 --> 20:20.175
[door closes]

20:21.263 --> 20:22.308
J.T.:
So,

20:22.351 --> 20:25.572
what's with
the high school reunion?

20:28.879 --> 20:31.665
Uh, the remains
of a retired cop, Stanley Tak,

20:31.708 --> 20:33.884
were discovered this
morning, and both your names

20:33.928 --> 20:37.279
were written on a notepad he
had been keeping before he died.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.238
I'm guessing by your look
you both knew him.

20:39.281 --> 20:42.066
Yeah. Yeah. He, uh...

20:42.110 --> 20:45.548
He talked to us
a few years ago about Vanessa.

20:45.592 --> 20:47.420
Who's that?

20:47.463 --> 20:50.031
She was my high school
girlfriend.

20:50.074 --> 20:51.902
She went missing
seven years ago.

20:51.946 --> 20:54.470
Vanessa Mangan.

20:54.514 --> 20:57.299
Stan worked on the task force
assigned to find her.

20:57.343 --> 21:00.215
So, during your, uh,
conversation with Tak,

21:00.259 --> 21:03.392
were you able to provide
any new information?

21:03.436 --> 21:05.525
The only thing I added

21:05.568 --> 21:08.876
was about our AP math teacher,
Mr. Caputo.

21:08.919 --> 21:10.921
Guy seemed way too interested
in Vanessa.

21:10.965 --> 21:13.272
How so?
Texting.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.230
Worked with her on weekends.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.014
Then, a few weeks
before she disappeared,

21:17.058 --> 21:18.451
he just left school.

21:18.494 --> 21:19.887
No one knew why.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.845
Why didn't you mention this
when Vanessa disappeared?

21:21.889 --> 21:24.413
It only seemed weird
when I looked back on it.

21:24.457 --> 21:26.372
There were rumors...

21:26.415 --> 21:28.330
Caputo had done something.

21:28.374 --> 21:30.593
A student ratted him out.

21:30.637 --> 21:32.769
But I didn't believe it.

21:32.813 --> 21:34.510
He was a great teacher.

21:34.554 --> 21:36.295
[door opens]

21:39.036 --> 21:40.516
What's going on?

21:40.560 --> 21:41.865
It's okay, Dad.
Uh, these detectives

21:41.909 --> 21:43.867
just wanted to ask us
a few questions.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.695
Everything okay?

21:45.739 --> 21:48.045
It's fine, Mr. Trevino.
We're not in trouble.

21:48.089 --> 21:50.570
[door opens, closes]

21:50.613 --> 21:52.528
Uh-oh.

21:54.487 --> 21:56.271
What are you doing here?

21:56.315 --> 21:57.881
Might ask you the same thing.

21:57.925 --> 21:59.970
From the looks of it, you're
still working the Tak case,

22:00.014 --> 22:02.277
even though our boss
told you to stand down.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.496
You gonna tell
the lieutenant?

22:03.539 --> 22:05.280
What would you do
if you were me?

22:05.324 --> 22:07.587
New shield, fresh off a beat.

22:07.630 --> 22:09.458
Truth? I'd do the job
I was given.

22:09.502 --> 22:10.633
But I wouldn't like it.

22:10.677 --> 22:14.594
Which is why this is hard.

22:14.637 --> 22:16.465
But HPD has got this.

22:16.509 --> 22:18.511
I've got this.

22:18.554 --> 22:20.382
So, with all due respect,

22:20.426 --> 22:22.471
you two need to stay
the hell out of it.

22:35.571 --> 22:36.833
This thing go any slower?

22:36.877 --> 22:38.835
It's a Ferrari. It sounds like
it's going fast

22:38.879 --> 22:40.097
even when it's going slow.

22:40.141 --> 22:42.186
Yeah, 72 isn't slow.

22:42.230 --> 22:44.232
Come on, we're only
in fourth gear.

22:44.275 --> 22:47.061
Try to remember I'm a cop,
and there's a speed limit.

22:49.629 --> 22:51.457
[engine slows]Happy?

22:53.023 --> 22:55.591
So...

22:55.635 --> 22:56.810
gonna stand down?

22:58.638 --> 23:00.640
I didn't think so.

23:00.683 --> 23:02.206
If Vanessa ratted out
her teacher,

23:02.250 --> 23:04.383
he would have had motive
to get rid of her.

23:04.426 --> 23:05.471
[sound of dogs barking]

23:05.514 --> 23:07.516
It's Higgins.

23:07.560 --> 23:08.996
I told her about Caputo.

23:09.039 --> 23:11.564
Higgins is actually really great
at background checks.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.696
Higgy, what do you got?

23:13.740 --> 23:14.915
HIGGINS:
Nothing, I'm afraid.

23:14.958 --> 23:17.570
This Mr. Caputo appears
to have vanished.

23:17.613 --> 23:20.964
No address, no job, no family,
no criminal record.

23:21.008 --> 23:22.488
You do realize you're
embarrassing me

23:22.531 --> 23:24.403
in front of Katsumoto, right?You're really not.

23:24.446 --> 23:25.491
Any details on why Caputo left

23:25.534 --> 23:26.927
Kuwili High?

23:26.970 --> 23:28.668
So far, no.

23:28.711 --> 23:30.626
But if there was something
inappropriate going on,

23:30.670 --> 23:32.585
it's possible that the school
was covering it up.

23:32.628 --> 23:33.977
I'll reach out
to the principal next.

23:34.021 --> 23:34.978
I'll let you know what I find.

23:35.022 --> 23:36.763
BOTH:
Mahalo.

23:37.807 --> 23:39.940
Sounds like you two gents

23:39.983 --> 23:41.507
are very much in sync.

23:41.550 --> 23:44.335
I'll talk to you later.

23:44.379 --> 23:46.642
Well, anybody feel
like some shave ice

23:46.686 --> 23:47.817
or Leonard's malasadas?

23:47.861 --> 23:49.906
GINA:
Ah, it's tempting.

23:52.300 --> 23:54.694
Actually, I think
we should leave now.What's wrong?

23:54.737 --> 23:55.738
Check my six.

24:01.788 --> 24:03.529
Yeah, we got to go.

24:03.572 --> 24:05.095
Yeah.
We got to go now.

24:14.670 --> 24:16.367
MAGNUM:
So, where'd you get
Vanessa's file?

24:16.411 --> 24:17.456
KATSUMOTO:
Stanley had a copy.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.936
What's it say?Not much.

24:19.980 --> 24:22.504
Vanessa was last seen
heading home from school.

24:22.548 --> 24:23.636
Then she vanished.
No witnesses.

24:23.679 --> 24:25.638
HPD question her parents?

24:25.681 --> 24:27.640
They both had solid alibis.

24:27.683 --> 24:29.555
Apparently, Dad was a mess.

24:29.598 --> 24:30.947
All he kept saying
to the cops was,

24:30.991 --> 24:32.079
he should have protected her.

24:33.820 --> 24:36.257
They moved to the
mainland, split up.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.868
Guess that's what happens
when your kid disappears.[phone ringing]

24:38.912 --> 24:41.741
Dr. Cunha.

24:41.784 --> 24:43.438
CUNHA:
Thanks to you two,
I now know more

24:43.482 --> 24:45.353
about mosquitoes
than anyone ever should.

24:45.396 --> 24:48.661
Species found on Stanley's boots
are Aedes aegypti.

24:48.704 --> 24:51.925
Dormant here for 60 years,
and then reappeared in 2012.

24:51.968 --> 24:52.969
Know where they can be found?

24:53.013 --> 24:54.710
Specific microclimates.

24:54.754 --> 24:56.712
But I'd stay away because
those nasty little guys

24:56.756 --> 24:58.279
can cause dengue fever.

24:58.322 --> 25:00.673
Be remiss if I didn't mention
the symptoms also included

25:00.716 --> 25:01.891
vomiting blood,

25:01.935 --> 25:03.240
the elimination of black,
tarry stools...

25:03.284 --> 25:05.721
Yeah, okay,
next time be remiss.

25:05.765 --> 25:07.723
Noelani, I should tell you...

25:07.767 --> 25:09.072
I know you're off the case.

25:09.116 --> 25:10.639
I don't care.

25:10.683 --> 25:12.511
I know what Detective Tak
meant to you.

25:12.554 --> 25:16.776
I'll call Detective Palea
with the info... eventually.

25:16.819 --> 25:18.821
Mahalo.

25:18.865 --> 25:22.129
You said Stanley liked
to walk Ralph near the beach,

25:22.172 --> 25:24.827
so what were they doing
in the middle of the woods?

25:24.871 --> 25:26.612
Stanley didn't get Ralph
from a shelter or breeder.

25:26.655 --> 25:28.744
He was his police dog,
trained for everything,

25:28.788 --> 25:30.441
including finding cadavers.

25:30.485 --> 25:32.269
So they weren't going
for a walk.

25:32.313 --> 25:33.793
They were looking
for Vanessa's body.

25:40.669 --> 25:42.018
[car door closes]

25:44.543 --> 25:46.675
So, this lawnmower's really
gonna help find a body?

25:46.719 --> 25:48.068
It's ground-penetrating radar.

25:48.111 --> 25:51.027
Allows you to image the
subsurface, so, yes.

25:51.071 --> 25:52.594
Why'd you just bring one?

25:52.638 --> 25:54.117
Given that you don't
know what it is,

25:54.161 --> 25:55.684
it's a safe bet you won't
know how to use it, right?

25:55.728 --> 25:56.772
Fair enough.

25:56.816 --> 25:58.731
It's gonna be dark soon.

25:58.774 --> 25:59.993
We should split up,
cover more ground?

26:00.036 --> 26:01.864
Yep.
Yep.

26:03.126 --> 26:05.302
[door closes and locks]

26:05.346 --> 26:07.391
I don't get it.

26:07.435 --> 26:09.002
Been on the ground
less than 12 hours.

26:09.045 --> 26:10.786
How'd they even find us?

26:10.830 --> 26:14.877
[sighs] Maybe somebody
recognized her from the airport.

26:14.921 --> 26:15.704
Tipped off Eddie.

26:15.748 --> 26:16.879
Or at the Rainbow.

26:16.923 --> 26:18.707
Look, it's gonna be okay.

26:18.751 --> 26:21.231
TC and I will sleep
in the adjoining room tonight.

26:21.275 --> 26:23.016
We'll be safe until
the Marshals get here.

26:23.059 --> 26:24.844
They'll get you off the Island,
get you a whole new identity.

26:24.887 --> 26:26.497
You'll disappear.

26:26.541 --> 26:29.892
Yeah, along with any chance I
have to fix things with Kelsey.

26:33.809 --> 26:35.202
I got to go ditch the car.

26:35.245 --> 26:36.682
You two stay here.

26:36.725 --> 26:38.901
Keep the door locked.

26:38.945 --> 26:40.990
I'll be back soon.

26:53.786 --> 26:55.788
[insects buzzing]

27:14.850 --> 27:16.765
Vanessa.

27:22.989 --> 27:24.860
[phone beeps]Ah.

27:27.167 --> 27:28.472
Ah, no reception.

27:30.692 --> 27:31.998
[grunts]

27:38.744 --> 27:40.702
KATSUMOTO:
Magnum. Magnum.

27:43.183 --> 27:44.488
Hey.

27:47.753 --> 27:48.710
What happened?

27:48.754 --> 27:50.190
[exhales]
Damn it.

27:50.233 --> 27:52.671
[groans]
Somebody knocked me out.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.198
It's gone.

27:59.852 --> 28:01.854
She was right there.

28:01.897 --> 28:04.944
You should go to the hospital.
You could have a concussion.

28:04.987 --> 28:05.988
No, I'm fine.

28:06.032 --> 28:08.425
I think it's time to call HPD.

28:08.469 --> 28:10.514
Can't. There's no service.

28:12.952 --> 28:15.519
Wait, hang on.

28:15.563 --> 28:16.825
Maybe that's what
happened to Stanley.

28:16.869 --> 28:18.479
He-he found the body,
he wanted to call it in,

28:18.522 --> 28:20.742
but there was no reception, so
he moved to a different place.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.744
That's where he and Ralph
were killed and buried.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.746
Okay, but how'd the killer know
Stanley was here?

28:24.790 --> 28:26.226
Maybe Stanley tipped 'em off

28:26.269 --> 28:27.793
when he started
the investigation.

28:29.882 --> 28:30.970
Right.

28:33.189 --> 28:36.758
Then we or HPD could
have done the same thing.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.804
Killer heard someone
was back on the case,

28:38.847 --> 28:41.937
so he came out here
to move Vanessa's remains.

28:41.981 --> 28:43.722
Why would he risk coming back?

28:45.332 --> 28:46.333
Hold that.

28:53.470 --> 28:54.776
Maybe because he thought
something was buried with it

28:54.820 --> 28:56.647
that could ID him.

29:08.485 --> 29:09.791
I don't want to see her.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.532
Can we just talk
for a minute?

29:11.575 --> 29:13.316
There's nothing to say.

29:17.581 --> 29:22.151
Look, I know your mom hurt you.

29:22.195 --> 29:24.371
And I know what
it must have felt like.

29:26.590 --> 29:31.291
My mom, she left me and my pops
when I was just a kid.

29:33.075 --> 29:36.905
She never gave me a reason,
never tried to reconnect.

29:40.082 --> 29:42.911
It took a piece out of me.

29:42.955 --> 29:46.828
But your mom, Kelsey...

29:46.872 --> 29:48.569
she was just trying
to keep you safe.

29:48.612 --> 29:51.398
It may not be what you
or I would have done.

29:53.182 --> 29:55.532
But you don't know
what it was like for her.

29:56.707 --> 29:59.928
In fact, there's a lot
you don't know.

29:59.972 --> 30:04.977
She just... she just wants
a chance to explain.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.424
[sighs]

30:17.467 --> 30:20.949
Not many choices.
Want first dibs?

30:20.993 --> 30:22.864
Oh, you can't go wrong
with dried seaweed.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.605
I'm glad you chose that one.

30:24.648 --> 30:25.824
[chuckles]

30:25.867 --> 30:26.955
[knock on door]

30:26.999 --> 30:28.087
TC:
Rick, it's me.

30:52.981 --> 30:54.983
We'll give you two some privacy.

31:05.124 --> 31:07.082
Good work.

31:07.126 --> 31:08.910
We'll see.

31:08.954 --> 31:10.085
What do you mean?

31:10.129 --> 31:11.913
You did it, you big softy.

31:11.957 --> 31:14.089
Kelsey is ready to
listen to her mom.

31:14.133 --> 31:15.569
Yeah, but is she ready
to forgive her?

31:15.612 --> 31:16.787
Well, why wouldn't she?

31:16.831 --> 31:18.311
Gina helped put a bad guy away.

31:18.354 --> 31:19.790
She left to protect the kid.

31:19.834 --> 31:22.881
Not that simple, believe me.

31:22.924 --> 31:25.100
But it's definitely
a start.

31:29.191 --> 31:31.063
[knocking]

31:31.106 --> 31:32.934
[door opens]

31:32.978 --> 31:34.936
[sighs]
Okay.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.895
Why'd you tell Higgins
I had a concussion?

31:36.938 --> 31:38.722
So she could keep
an eye on you.

31:38.766 --> 31:40.289
Yeah, she woke me up
every hour.

31:40.333 --> 31:42.944
She didn't want you
to die in your sleep.

31:42.988 --> 31:44.946
You call HPD?

31:44.990 --> 31:47.122
Well, I thought about it.

31:47.166 --> 31:49.168
Then I thought
about you keeping your job.

31:50.560 --> 31:51.822
Y-You talked to two witnesses,

31:51.866 --> 31:53.433
you got stolen evidence
in your house,

31:53.476 --> 31:55.304
and we just tampered
with a crime scene.

31:55.348 --> 31:57.611
Do you have another plan?Yeah, we stay the course.

31:57.654 --> 31:58.873
We catch the killer.
We do that,

31:58.917 --> 32:00.570
your boss is gonna have
to look the other way.

32:01.615 --> 32:03.747
Problem is,
we have very few leads.

32:03.791 --> 32:05.793
Actually, we have no leads.

32:05.836 --> 32:07.664
Higgins looked
into the teacher.

32:07.708 --> 32:08.970
Caputo wasn't fired.

32:09.014 --> 32:10.232
He was being stalked
by his ex-girlfriend,

32:10.276 --> 32:11.973
so he changed his name,
moved to Iowa

32:12.017 --> 32:13.279
before Vanessa disappeared.

32:13.322 --> 32:14.410
What about the cell phone?[door opens]

32:14.454 --> 32:15.716
Well, Higgins is trying

32:15.759 --> 32:16.978
to bring it back to life,

32:17.022 --> 32:18.849
but after being underground
for seven years,

32:18.893 --> 32:23.202
it's pretty damaged.Which, for anyone else,
could pose a problem.

32:23.245 --> 32:25.030
Now, hold on,
you got it to work?

32:25.073 --> 32:27.467
Retrieved selfies from the
day that Vanessa disappeared.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.077
Looks like they were
taken in the same woods

32:29.121 --> 32:30.209
where she was buried.

32:30.252 --> 32:31.862
Anyone else in those photos?Mm-hmm.

32:31.906 --> 32:34.126
Looks like
her boyfriend.

32:34.169 --> 32:35.040
That's not her boyfriend.

32:35.083 --> 32:36.606
MAGNUM:
No, it's Mike Trevino.

32:36.650 --> 32:38.826
That's the same guy that pointed
the finger at Caputo.

32:38.869 --> 32:40.001
And according
to the case file,

32:40.045 --> 32:41.133
he also said
he didn't see Vanessa

32:41.176 --> 32:42.090
after school that day.

32:42.134 --> 32:43.265
HIGGINS:
Sounds like Mike Trevino

32:43.309 --> 32:44.701
has something to hide.

32:49.358 --> 32:51.099
Your son-- where is he?

32:51.143 --> 32:52.927
He's not here.That's not what I asked.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.973
I don't know where he is!But you know what he did!

32:55.016 --> 32:57.540
Looks like he packed in a hurry.

32:57.584 --> 32:59.020
You son of a bitch.

32:59.064 --> 33:01.892
You knew what he did,
and you let him go anyway.

33:09.204 --> 33:12.164
HPD's on their way to
take you into custody.

33:12.207 --> 33:14.383
Thanks, Higgins.

33:16.081 --> 33:18.518
Mike Jr.'s booked on a flight
that leaves in one hour.

33:21.825 --> 33:24.654
Forget that I'm a cop.

33:24.698 --> 33:26.743
I want to see that thing fly.

33:36.231 --> 33:38.190
KATSUMOTO:
Montenegro, huh?

33:38.233 --> 33:40.366
Pretty smart. No extradition
treaty with the U.S.

33:41.845 --> 33:42.933
[groans]

33:46.241 --> 33:47.503
Hey!

33:50.245 --> 33:52.726
MAN:
Hey, man, what the hell?

34:01.778 --> 34:02.866
[bystanders gasping]MAN 2:
Hey.

34:05.565 --> 34:07.219
[waitress yelps]

34:09.134 --> 34:10.048
Hey.
