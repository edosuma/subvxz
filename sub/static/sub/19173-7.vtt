00:16.283 --> 00:19.287
I opened the gates for you.
Handed you this victory.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.489
Your men need to know
my wife is not to be harmed.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.324
Even if that order
could be given,

00:23.424 --> 00:24.558
no one would heed it.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.026
They've been let loose.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.273
If you had suffered such loss...

00:29.297 --> 00:31.632
...is there anything you can
imagine making it right?

00:31.732 --> 00:35.203
No, but I imagine
getting my hands on the man
responsible for it

00:35.303 --> 00:36.504
would be a start.

00:36.604 --> 00:39.640
If we fight them together,
there's a good chance we live.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.142
Separate, and we all die.

00:41.242 --> 00:45.413
When Flint heads south,
we head north.

00:45.513 --> 00:48.416
What's north?
Eleanor Guthrie's
grandfather.

00:48.516 --> 00:51.952
They heard
that Nassau had fallen,
and so they came to join us.

00:52.052 --> 00:55.089
The revolution
you promised
has begun.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.091
- Where's MADI?
- I need you to know

00:57.191 --> 00:59.593
that I did
everything I could
to keep her safe.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.796
It wasn't your fault.

03:15.729 --> 03:18.732
I wasn't able
to say good-bye to her...

03:24.572 --> 03:28.276
so I don't know
what she would've wanted me
to say to you right now...

03:30.344 --> 03:32.346
if anything at all.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.321
She and I...

03:42.356 --> 03:44.525
we'd become close.

03:47.928 --> 03:51.299
So, I think I have some sense
of what it might've been.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.509
She was curious.

04:03.477 --> 04:05.346
And strong.

04:07.348 --> 04:10.618
Not made to be hidden away
from the world.

04:13.787 --> 04:16.656
She was able to see it

04:16.757 --> 04:18.926
before she died.

04:21.428 --> 04:24.532
And she was fighting for
something she believed in

04:24.632 --> 04:26.400
when she died.

04:34.342 --> 04:36.577
You knew her well.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.052
I loved her.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.792
And I believe she loved me.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.971
I think she would've
wanted you to know that, too.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.956
And you say
welcome them in,
but...

05:23.056 --> 05:24.825
I mean, they've never been free.

05:34.602 --> 05:37.905
No one's at each other's
throats yet here?

05:38.005 --> 05:39.707
Whatever their differences,

05:39.807 --> 05:44.478
everyone is here
to be part of ending
colonial rule in the New World.

05:44.578 --> 05:45.913
As long as that's a possibility,

05:46.013 --> 05:48.682
no one wants to be the one
to spoil the chance.

05:54.622 --> 05:55.756
What's this?

05:55.856 --> 05:57.625
Discussing an attack

05:57.725 --> 05:59.827
on St. Ann's Bay
as a first strike.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.829
They've both
been through there
in recent months.

06:01.929 --> 06:06.033
Trying to agree on
what kind of resistance
we'd likely face.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.041
How is she?

06:16.510 --> 06:18.446
She's breathing.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.649
How are you?

06:27.455 --> 06:29.857
In St. Ann's Bay,
we can agree that there are

06:29.957 --> 06:32.526
two 10-pound guns
on the beach.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.862
And men-at-arms
number at least 80.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.730
No more than 100.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.031
100?

06:39.066 --> 06:41.068
I figured twice that.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.637
If we could set
enough men up the coast...

06:43.737 --> 06:47.307
say three times that,
give or take...

06:47.475 --> 06:49.810
we could seize the town
within a day.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.480
If you take St. Ann's,
you'll starve Bridgetown.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.847
She wouldn't last a month.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.850
And Barbados has just fallen.

06:58.552 --> 07:01.354
With Bridgetown
as a staging ground,

07:01.489 --> 07:04.124
how many men could you muster
to move to the mainland?

07:04.224 --> 07:07.094
700, maybe eight.

07:07.194 --> 07:10.130
If we could recruit
one slave in three
in Barbados,

07:10.230 --> 07:15.068
that's 1,200 men we could land
anywhere we chose,

07:15.168 --> 07:17.404
with ships to support
their landing.

07:17.505 --> 07:20.373
That's roughly
what Morgan had in Panama.

07:20.508 --> 07:23.076
It might just be enough
for us to sack Boston.

07:23.176 --> 07:25.245
Boston?

07:28.215 --> 07:30.584
Fools.

07:34.788 --> 07:39.092
You're all fools
if you think this road leads
to where he says it does.

07:39.192 --> 07:43.363
I have not proven to you
my commitment to our
common cause?

07:43.531 --> 07:46.233
What happens
when our enemy realizes

07:46.333 --> 07:48.368
that all it needs to do
to defeat us

07:48.536 --> 07:51.138
is to take away
that common cause?

07:51.238 --> 07:53.273
Turn one against the other.

07:53.541 --> 07:56.043
And when that happens...

07:56.143 --> 07:58.378
as it is all
but certain to do...

07:58.546 --> 08:00.648
which of us standing here

08:00.748 --> 08:02.215
are likely to be
the ones who benefit

08:02.315 --> 08:05.452
and which the ones
sold back into their chains?

08:05.553 --> 08:07.154
Then what the fuck
are you doing here?

08:12.726 --> 08:16.229
I saved
your men's lives
and yours

08:16.329 --> 08:19.567
from the fight you started
but could not finish.

08:19.633 --> 08:24.071
And now you would
start another that no man
can hope to finish?

08:24.171 --> 08:26.607
Then leave.

08:31.745 --> 08:35.248
But what's happening here
is going to happen.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.918
This war is going to begin.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.320
This camp is going to fight it

08:40.587 --> 08:43.023
with or without you.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.697
They may call you a king,

08:49.797 --> 08:52.866
but only in the kingdom
that is no more.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.703
We're all free men here.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.306
And I wish to stay that way.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.743
As do we all.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.880
Will you join me?

09:31.639 --> 09:35.643
Shh, shh, shh.

09:48.689 --> 09:51.524
We have left the bay
for the Delaware.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.226
We will be arriving soon.

09:53.326 --> 09:54.728
I'll be there in a moment.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.943
She ain't been back down here...

10:11.679 --> 10:13.681
since we set sail.

10:15.783 --> 10:18.018
You told her to fuck off.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.787
She listened.

10:19.887 --> 10:22.890
She told me
she ain't got
no apology...

10:24.091 --> 10:25.625
for what she'd done.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.361
I know.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.164
Part of me wanted to lash out.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.734
Betrayed you.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.303
Betrayed me.

10:36.403 --> 10:39.006
Refuses to make it right.

10:39.106 --> 10:42.743
Mm-hm. And the other part?

10:42.843 --> 10:45.145
The other part...

10:46.446 --> 10:48.949
knew how easy
it would've been
for her to lie.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.389
Say she was sorry
when she ain't.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.293
I don't know
what the fuck to think.

11:02.963 --> 11:07.334
You told her not to
come back down here,
didn't you?

11:09.102 --> 11:12.773
You'll have plenty of time
to murder her another day.

11:12.873 --> 11:16.777
Right now, you need to rest.

12:08.796 --> 12:10.931
You asked to see me, my lord?

12:26.413 --> 12:30.818
I cannot imagine
what sort of horror
this is for you.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.956
Please know,

12:36.056 --> 12:39.459
to whatever extent
there could be any doubt,

12:39.559 --> 12:41.895
that the choices she made
in recent days

12:41.995 --> 12:44.331
were made out of concern for you

12:44.431 --> 12:45.999
and out of love...

12:46.099 --> 12:48.869
I spoke with Governor Raja...

12:50.971 --> 12:52.439
just before he set sail.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.275
I wanted to be certain

12:55.375 --> 12:56.944
that our account with him
was squared,

12:57.044 --> 12:59.179
that we ought to expect
no return by his fleet,

12:59.279 --> 13:02.983
considering there were
promises made to him

13:03.083 --> 13:04.852
that remain unfulfilled...

13:04.918 --> 13:09.122
to deliver
the still missing cache
and Jack Rackham.

13:12.059 --> 13:16.196
Governor Raja
assured me he had already
written off the missing cache,

13:16.296 --> 13:19.166
the war effort being
of paramount importance.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.902
But Captain Rackham...

13:24.872 --> 13:27.875
he said he had never asked
for Captain Rackham.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.445
You added that part.

13:34.014 --> 13:37.784
A convenient lie
to placate Havana

13:37.885 --> 13:40.888
and improve your own
prospects for survival,
didn't you?

13:44.157 --> 13:45.959
Didn't you?

13:49.096 --> 13:51.098
Yes.

13:53.666 --> 13:57.170
Eleanor turned her guns on me.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.608
Eleanor betrayed me.

14:01.708 --> 14:04.912
Surrendered Nassau
out from under me.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.915
None of that sounded
like anything that would
ever occur to her to do.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.350
Not her.
Not after everything
we'd been through.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.956
But if it had
occurred first
to someone else...

14:16.056 --> 14:18.625
No, sir.
Someone standing
so close to her,

14:18.725 --> 14:21.194
who could and would
manipulate her

14:21.294 --> 14:22.996
to secure their own survival.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.264
My lord, I did no such thing.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.966
Not now!

14:26.066 --> 14:28.535
Why would I believe you?

14:28.635 --> 14:30.637
Was there not
an agreement between you

14:30.737 --> 14:32.940
that you would be released
from your obligations

14:33.006 --> 14:34.117
and returned to your family...

14:34.141 --> 14:35.584
May I speak, please?!

14:35.608 --> 14:37.544
Jesus, what is it?!

14:40.247 --> 14:42.415
Beg your pardon,

14:42.515 --> 14:44.151
but you'd asked to be notified

14:44.251 --> 14:46.987
when we were finished
dressing the body.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.260
Thank you,
Mr. Rawls.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.498
What?

14:58.598 --> 15:00.968
In dressing the body, my lord...

15:02.602 --> 15:04.037
I don't know how to say it.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.106
Leave.
Beg pardon, ma'am?

15:06.206 --> 15:09.042
Leave now, please.
I'd be careful
if I were you.

15:09.142 --> 15:12.179
Mr. Rawls,
get out of this room.
Mrs. Hudson!

15:12.279 --> 15:16.049
You don't want to hear
what he's about to tell you.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.619
Not like this.

15:23.190 --> 15:26.159
You don't want
to hear about it this way.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.396
Hear what?

15:52.252 --> 15:53.386
I can't quite read this.

15:53.486 --> 15:56.723
Trade. The trade tax
set by the general post.

15:56.823 --> 15:59.292
- The Society of Friends?
- I don't have any friends.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.352
- That's the rules.
- Set by him, is it?

16:01.428 --> 16:03.163
The nine shillings
is set in stone.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.433
two shillings.

16:06.533 --> 16:07.934
two shillings.

16:08.035 --> 16:11.171
Pilot's fee departure,
three shillings.

16:11.271 --> 16:14.307
It costs more to leave than...

16:14.407 --> 16:16.043
Trading fee.
Not trading anything.

16:16.109 --> 16:17.744
No matter.
Non-negotiable.
Sixpence.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.422
And I swear to God,
I'm not making this up,

16:19.446 --> 16:22.849
"Voluntary contribution
to the Society of Friends:

16:23.083 --> 16:24.484
two shillings.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.053
Non-negotiable."

16:26.153 --> 16:29.256
This is... this is
truly marvelous.

16:29.356 --> 16:32.225
And we're the thieves.
Not very good ones,
apparently.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.227
Did he know where to find
Mr. Guthrie?

16:34.327 --> 16:37.064
He did, though he didn't seem
terribly optimistic

16:37.130 --> 16:39.132
about our chances
of gaining an audience.

16:39.232 --> 16:42.069
When he hears
the news we are bringing,
he will grant us an audience.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.271
No, no.
There's no "we."

16:46.839 --> 16:49.609
I have as much to gain
and more to lose
than any of us

16:49.709 --> 16:52.712
if we fail to see
Governor Rogers removed.

16:52.812 --> 16:55.282
I believe
I should be with you.
I'm sure you do.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.625
The last thing
I need to overhear

16:56.649 --> 16:58.918
when Mr. Guthrie
rejects our proposal is, uh...

16:59.086 --> 17:02.189
"Uh, Monsieur Constable, what
sort of reward might one expect

17:02.289 --> 17:05.358
for aiding in 'zhe' capture
of a notorious pirate captain,

17:05.458 --> 17:08.461
such as, say, oh, Jack Rackham?

17:08.560 --> 17:11.330
Really?
'Zhat' much?

17:11.431 --> 17:13.866
Huh.
Well, what do you know?

17:14.101 --> 17:15.335
'Zhere' he is."

17:15.435 --> 17:16.935
You'll stay here.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.138
I'll be back.
You, let's go.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.141
Fuck, it's cold!

17:34.121 --> 17:36.356
I can no longer feel my balls.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.163
No one should live here.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.132
You're wrong about her.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.700
Max.

17:49.269 --> 17:52.439
When that animal Berringer
was terrorizing her,

17:52.539 --> 17:57.144
threatening to kill her
unless she agreed to name her
connections to the resistance...

17:58.278 --> 17:59.779
she refused.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.751
She's not crossed anyone,
to my knowledge,

18:04.851 --> 18:07.154
who hasn't first crossed her,

18:07.220 --> 18:09.156
present company included.

18:11.358 --> 18:13.526
Jack.
I heard you.

18:23.536 --> 18:27.340
Go see what kind of surgeon
you can engage for Anne.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.676
I'll...

18:29.776 --> 18:31.010
do this.

18:33.646 --> 18:36.183
What?

18:36.249 --> 18:39.586
It's somehow
only just occurred to me
how ruined we'll be

18:39.686 --> 18:41.454
if I fail to win
the man on the other side

18:41.554 --> 18:43.523
of that door to our cause.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.293
No home.

18:46.393 --> 18:47.794
No cache.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.496
Anne on death's door.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.664
A ship that can barely sail.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.935
But worst of all,

18:56.203 --> 18:58.205
he'll have won.

18:59.572 --> 19:02.242
Woodes Rogers will sit in Nassau

19:02.342 --> 19:04.844
and grow old
knowing that he was
measured against us

19:04.944 --> 19:07.447
and proven the better man.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.551
So, don't fail.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.360
I once thought like you.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.898
That because I had reason
to mistrust the pirates,

19:25.998 --> 19:29.236
that it necessarily followed
that I must mistrust them.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.305
But it is not so.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.943
For there is also reason
to see common interest
with them.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.880
I have fought
alongside these men.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.316
I have fought
alongside these men.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.586
But I did it so that
I might find security.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.156
But what they are now
arguing for

19:50.257 --> 19:51.891
does not sound
like security to me.

19:51.991 --> 19:55.094
There is no lasting security
to be had here.

19:55.262 --> 19:56.896
We'll fight to change that.

19:56.996 --> 19:59.766
Nothing is lasting.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.735
But months, years,

20:02.835 --> 20:04.604
that is meaningful

20:04.704 --> 20:06.339
and it can be had here.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.243
You now have the resources
to have it here.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.645
There is a treasure
in the ground here.

20:12.745 --> 20:15.047
It'd purchase
whatever is needed
to survive.

20:19.486 --> 20:23.122
No one has ever been this close,

20:23.222 --> 20:26.559
this near a chance
to change the world.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.329
No one changes the world.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.564
Not like this.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.500
Not all at once.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.637
The world
is too strong for that.

21:02.529 --> 21:04.964
From the moment
he started speaking,

21:05.064 --> 21:07.334
I couldn't stop
thinking about her.

21:10.002 --> 21:12.772
She died for this.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.541
She believed in this,

21:14.641 --> 21:18.945
and if it all goes away,
then it was all for nothing.

21:23.550 --> 21:26.986
I can't let this
be for nothing.
I just can't.

21:28.955 --> 21:32.091
It has to mean...

21:32.359 --> 21:33.593
something.

21:55.382 --> 21:58.551
When I was drowning
over Miranda...

22:01.053 --> 22:03.923
you helped me find my way out.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.725
Look at me.

22:11.631 --> 22:13.866
I will do the same for you.

22:14.934 --> 22:16.936
I give you my word.

22:18.605 --> 22:21.708
But in order to do that,

22:21.808 --> 22:25.144
you have to
trust my judgment
for a little while

22:25.412 --> 22:27.179
while yours is reeling.

22:30.617 --> 22:32.952
You think Julius gained
momentum from what I said?

22:33.052 --> 22:35.087
Don't worry about it.

22:35.187 --> 22:38.425
Everything is moving forward.

22:39.559 --> 22:40.927
Just...

22:43.630 --> 22:45.064
trust me.

22:59.812 --> 23:02.449
It's been going on so long.
We will get
to the bottom of this.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.517
Is it true?

23:06.486 --> 23:07.587
I'm sorry?

23:07.687 --> 23:10.657
Uh, is it true

23:10.757 --> 23:13.493
that you've come from Nassau?

23:16.195 --> 23:18.465
It's true, isn't it?

23:19.466 --> 23:21.067
You're one of them.

23:22.469 --> 23:23.936
You're a pirate.

23:26.606 --> 23:29.141
You are!

23:29.241 --> 23:32.979
I hear everyone
knows everyone there,
even the giants.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.047
Will you tell me,

23:35.147 --> 23:37.049
did you know Edward Teach?

23:37.149 --> 23:39.051
Yeah.

23:45.157 --> 23:47.159
And Jack Rackham?

23:47.259 --> 23:50.563
Did you know him, too?

23:50.663 --> 23:53.165
I heard a story
that Jack Rackham
outsmarted Captain Flint

23:53.265 --> 23:56.536
to capture
a Spanish treasure galleon
right out from under him.

23:57.904 --> 23:59.238
Yeah.

23:59.506 --> 24:00.973
Knew him, too.

24:01.073 --> 24:02.685
And believe it or not,
that story is true.

24:02.709 --> 24:04.511
What about Charles Vane?

24:10.517 --> 24:14.053
Charles Vane was
my closest friend
in the world.

24:14.153 --> 24:17.089
Tell me everything about him.

24:21.227 --> 24:23.863
He was the bravest man
I ever knew.

24:25.532 --> 24:30.970
Not without fear,
just unwilling to
let it diminish him.

24:31.070 --> 24:33.239
And loyal to a fault.

24:34.907 --> 24:39.546
And in a world where
honesty is so regularly
and casually disregarded...

24:39.612 --> 24:42.024
I heard he cut off
a man's head and left it
as a marker in the sand

24:42.048 --> 24:43.550
to anyone who would cross him.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.886
It was a little more
complicated than that.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.454
I heard...
Hmm?

24:48.555 --> 24:51.558
...he sometimes
butchered his enemies
for amusement,

24:51.591 --> 24:52.959
made stew of their flesh.

24:53.059 --> 24:54.193
He was truly an animal.

24:54.293 --> 24:57.396
Stew?
Mm-hmm.

24:57.564 --> 25:00.132
For what possible...

25:00.232 --> 25:01.834
I'm...
I beg your pardon,

25:01.934 --> 25:04.236
but do you believe this?

25:04.336 --> 25:06.105
I read it in a newspaper.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.575
Oh.
Mm.

25:10.943 --> 25:13.179
Mr. Guthrie
will see you now.

25:18.918 --> 25:21.754
Charles Vane was a good man.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.956
What I told you was the truth.

25:24.056 --> 25:26.425
Put down the newspapers
and read a book.

25:31.598 --> 25:33.800
Truth isn't nearly
as interesting.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.803
I'm sorry, what was that?

25:36.903 --> 25:39.806
Uh, I said the truth
isn't nearly as interesting.

25:43.643 --> 25:45.011
Sir.

26:01.728 --> 26:04.631
I understand you believe
we have business.

26:04.731 --> 26:08.400
News of the Bahama Islands
of some sort, Mr....

26:08.635 --> 26:10.870
what is it?

26:10.970 --> 26:12.705
Rackham.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.809
Captain Jack Rackham.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.114
Is that so?

26:23.816 --> 26:24.851
The news I bring

26:24.951 --> 26:27.486
is of personal concern
to you, Mr. Guthrie.

26:27.654 --> 26:30.657
Would you prefer
if we discussed it
privately?

26:30.723 --> 26:32.191
Say what you came to say.

26:38.264 --> 26:40.867
Your granddaughter
Eleanor is dead.

26:43.736 --> 26:48.174
Governor Woodes Rogers
plotted with Spanish forces

26:48.274 --> 26:51.310
to help him quell
a resistance movement
on New Providence Island

26:51.410 --> 26:53.345
by razing it to the ground.

26:53.445 --> 26:56.048
And Eleanor was killed
as a result.

26:58.685 --> 27:00.753
I come to offer an opportunity

27:00.853 --> 27:04.123
to see that offense answered

27:04.223 --> 27:08.160
and find great
commercial opportunity
in the process.

27:09.929 --> 27:13.299
Woodes Rogers bears debts
he cannot hope to repay.

27:13.399 --> 27:15.101
Given the ruin Nassau lies in,

27:15.201 --> 27:16.803
those debts could be purchased

27:16.903 --> 27:20.539
for a mere fraction
of their value,
for pennies.

27:20.707 --> 27:22.608
You could own Woodes Rogers

27:22.709 --> 27:24.110
and see him imprisoned.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.545
Meanwhile,
while Nassau smolders,

27:26.713 --> 27:29.215
her real property
could be bought
for a song.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.550
I bring you the chance, sir,

27:31.718 --> 27:35.387
to own the island,
shape the regime
that runs it,

27:35.487 --> 27:37.824
and do it all while
seeing justice visited

27:37.924 --> 27:39.225
on your granddaughter's
murderer.

27:39.325 --> 27:40.927
No.

27:42.795 --> 27:45.898
No to which part?

27:45.998 --> 27:48.100
All of it.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.971
Mr. Guthrie,
if you'd allow me
to explain further...

27:52.071 --> 27:53.940
I heard what you said.

27:54.974 --> 27:56.843
The offense to my family's name

27:56.943 --> 27:59.779
was done a long time ago

27:59.879 --> 28:01.848
by my son.

28:01.948 --> 28:05.417
He, his daughter,
and all their efforts

28:05.517 --> 28:08.054
are parties to that offense

28:08.154 --> 28:10.823
and are no longer
family of mine.

28:13.793 --> 28:15.327
That is all.

28:30.109 --> 28:32.278
She's dead, isn't she?

28:39.185 --> 28:41.620
Excuse me?

28:41.788 --> 28:44.156
The news you bring
about Eleanor.

28:44.256 --> 28:47.293
It's that she's dead, isn't it?

28:47.393 --> 28:49.862
It is.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.065
And who are you?

28:53.165 --> 28:55.334
Her grandmother.

28:59.105 --> 29:01.407
Wait outside.

29:01.507 --> 29:03.609
I'll join you shortly.

29:15.888 --> 29:18.290
How long had she known?

29:21.894 --> 29:24.030
I honestly don't know.

29:26.032 --> 29:28.835
Not long, I don't believe.

29:31.303 --> 29:34.273
She rarely included me
in her thinking.

29:36.175 --> 29:40.246
What I knew of her
was mostly observed

29:40.346 --> 29:42.181
rather than shared.

29:44.350 --> 29:47.186
But one thing
I know to be true...

29:49.188 --> 29:53.425
whatever risk she took
or danger she braved...

29:55.928 --> 29:58.364
they were all made
out of love for you.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.935
She saw a life with you

30:03.035 --> 30:04.803
and the child...

30:08.407 --> 30:12.078
and she was determined
to deliver you all into it.

30:19.418 --> 30:21.854
I'd like a moment alone.

30:39.405 --> 30:43.375
I am so very sorry.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.330
I'm sorry.

31:50.676 --> 31:52.578
I'm sorry.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.757
I am...

32:08.995 --> 32:11.530
I beg your pardon, my lord.

32:13.099 --> 32:15.834
What is it?

32:16.002 --> 32:17.042
We need more supplies.

32:17.136 --> 32:20.572
We found him
amongst prisoners
in the interior.

32:20.672 --> 32:23.109
I don't advise
that we consolidate them...

32:23.209 --> 32:26.212
Absolutely. I mean,
the wars are our priorities.

32:26.312 --> 32:28.614
A ringleader
of the pirate militia.

32:28.714 --> 32:31.083
He surrendered himself.

32:31.183 --> 32:33.485
Said he would only
speak with you directly.

32:34.553 --> 32:36.188
Speak with me?

32:38.024 --> 32:39.358
About what?

32:39.458 --> 32:42.394
He said he wants to make a deal.

32:56.275 --> 32:58.444
Follow me, please, Captain.

33:00.179 --> 33:04.516
Those men at that table
are among the wealthiest
in the Pennsylvania Colony

33:04.616 --> 33:08.420
and critical suppliers
to my husband's business.

33:08.520 --> 33:11.890
They consider character
to be of paramount importance

33:12.058 --> 33:13.592
in choosing their partners,

33:13.692 --> 33:16.095
and so my husband
has gone to great lengths

33:16.195 --> 33:18.464
to assure them that our family's

33:18.564 --> 33:21.533
sordid beginnings
are long since behind us,

33:21.633 --> 33:23.102
and you just
stood in front of them

33:23.202 --> 33:26.072
and proposed that my husband
join you in a revenge plot

33:26.138 --> 33:30.076
against the royal governor
of New Providence Island.

33:34.846 --> 33:37.383
I'm afraid
I may have fumbled
my case, then, ma'am,

33:37.483 --> 33:40.919
but the merits of it remain
and exist well beyond revenge.

33:41.087 --> 33:43.522
If you could help me gain
your husband's ear again,

33:43.622 --> 33:46.492
this time in private,
outside the presence
of those other men...

33:46.592 --> 33:47.926
My husband's
commercial interests

33:48.094 --> 33:50.896
have grown 12-fold
in the past three years.

33:51.097 --> 33:52.998
By some estimates,

33:53.099 --> 33:56.668
the estate represents
the ninth largest
family fortune

33:56.768 --> 33:58.737
in the Americas.

33:58.837 --> 34:01.107
Does that sound like
something built by a man

34:01.173 --> 34:03.642
who would discard
an opportunity as
promising as this

34:03.742 --> 34:06.178
because of what
the neighbors might think?

34:07.513 --> 34:09.215
No, it doesn't.

34:09.315 --> 34:11.683
So, what does that tell you?

34:13.585 --> 34:15.587
It tells me...

34:18.257 --> 34:21.127
It tells me that
either Joseph Guthrie

34:21.226 --> 34:23.995
is among the 10 luckiest men
in the Americas

34:24.130 --> 34:25.630
or that your husband's business

34:25.731 --> 34:28.600
is not entirely managed
by your husband.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.806
I see merit to your proposal.

34:35.907 --> 34:39.344
Though, I've yet
to see your merit.

34:39.445 --> 34:43.149
Why would I even consider
taking on a pirate as
a partner like this?

34:44.283 --> 34:46.351
First, I and my partners

34:46.452 --> 34:49.054
have intimate knowledge
of Nassau's operations.

34:49.155 --> 34:50.489
We've made it work once before

34:50.589 --> 34:52.591
and could again with your help.

34:52.690 --> 34:55.561
And second,

34:55.661 --> 35:00.366
in all the years
the Guthrie family has had
a relationship with Nassau,

35:00.466 --> 35:03.502
I imagine I'm the first pirate
to find his way to your ear.

35:03.602 --> 35:08.340
So, either
I'm the single luckiest
pirate in all creation

35:08.440 --> 35:11.543
or I'm of a different sort
to the rest of them.

35:17.483 --> 35:20.186
Haul away!

35:24.223 --> 35:26.392
What happened
with Mr. Guthrie?

35:26.492 --> 35:28.227
Were you able to speak with him?

35:28.327 --> 35:30.329
Mm-hmm.
What did he say?

35:30.429 --> 35:32.731
He told me to go fuck myself.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.766
Well, that does not sound good.

35:34.866 --> 35:36.302
The business isn't his.

35:36.402 --> 35:40.339
Well, the horses are his,
the cart is his,

35:40.439 --> 35:43.775
but it appears the wife
is the one holding the reins.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.345
Eleanor's grandmother?

35:46.445 --> 35:48.380
And she is interested.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.249
She invited me
to return this evening

35:50.349 --> 35:52.818
to provide details
of our proposal.

35:52.918 --> 35:57.223
Prove that we can be trusted
to manage Nassau in the event
of Rogers' removal.

35:58.590 --> 36:00.692
And I think
you should come with me.

36:00.792 --> 36:03.229
You do?

36:04.230 --> 36:05.231
Why?

36:05.297 --> 36:07.766
Because our plan is ludicrous

36:07.866 --> 36:09.535
by any sane measure

36:09.635 --> 36:11.537
and my suspicion is
if she's going to say yes,

36:11.637 --> 36:14.640
it's going to be
for emotional reasons
rather than financial ones.

36:16.242 --> 36:18.510
She would look
across the table
and see a woman

36:18.610 --> 36:22.113
with some experience
quietly wielding power
over men

36:22.314 --> 36:24.115
without them knowing it,

36:24.250 --> 36:26.585
and a woman who might
remind her of herself.

36:26.685 --> 36:30.356
It might go a long way
towards winning her.

36:36.462 --> 36:38.397
Do you know who I am?

36:40.466 --> 36:43.569
You're part of
Long John Silver's
resistance.

36:46.538 --> 36:49.441
I am Long John Silver.

36:52.744 --> 36:55.381
The resistance
in the interior...

36:56.648 --> 36:58.950
I built it.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.487
I led it.
It was mine.

37:03.289 --> 37:06.658
I was hitting
your supply lines
to the estates,

37:06.758 --> 37:09.861
fomenting sabotage
in Nassau Town.

37:11.930 --> 37:14.600
Fighting your soldiers
in untold skirmishes.

37:17.769 --> 37:19.738
You killed many of my men

37:19.838 --> 37:22.374
and I got
my fair share of yours.

37:25.311 --> 37:28.780
Why would you tell me this?

37:28.880 --> 37:32.684
Because I want you to know
that I'm withholding
nothing.

37:32.784 --> 37:34.886
That I'm telling the truth.

37:36.422 --> 37:38.790
And I know
what I'm talking about.

37:41.527 --> 37:44.563
I don't care
about the cause now.

37:44.663 --> 37:47.399
I don't care about Nassau now.

37:47.499 --> 37:51.503
I want one thing
and one thing only.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.373
What is that?

37:57.809 --> 38:00.045
They all turned on me.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.915
Discarded
what I'd done for them,

38:04.015 --> 38:06.752
the sacrifices I made,

38:06.852 --> 38:08.954
and left me for dead.

38:12.358 --> 38:14.860
And I want them all
to pay for it.

38:18.697 --> 38:20.699
I cannot achieve it on my own.

38:21.833 --> 38:24.370
You could...

38:24.436 --> 38:27.839
if you were so inclined
and you knew how.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.979
Are you so inclined?

38:36.748 --> 38:38.984
Do you know how?

38:44.456 --> 38:48.026
They are strong
when Flint and Silver
are united.

38:48.126 --> 38:51.497
But separate the two of them,

38:51.597 --> 38:53.231
turn them one against the other,

38:53.399 --> 38:55.801
and their world collapses.

38:55.901 --> 38:59.805
I tried once and failed.

38:59.905 --> 39:04.242
But I didn't possess
the instrument necessary
to make it work.

39:04.410 --> 39:07.413
And you possess it now?

39:07.479 --> 39:09.014
No.

39:11.617 --> 39:13.619
You do.

39:31.970 --> 39:34.239
You brought a friend.

39:34.473 --> 39:36.475
A partner.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.278
What sort of partner is that?

39:40.446 --> 39:44.282
She's operated
significant commercial
interests in Nassau Town,

39:44.450 --> 39:47.152
and both before and after
restored colonial rule...

39:47.453 --> 39:48.920
Does she speak?

39:54.460 --> 39:56.462
There is no business of Nassau's

39:56.528 --> 39:58.830
that has not been
business of mine
for some time.

39:58.930 --> 40:02.601
And aside from
the interference of
Woodes Rogers and his men,

40:02.701 --> 40:05.270
my business has been sound.

40:05.471 --> 40:07.706
This substantiates that.

40:07.806 --> 40:10.976
Mr. Oliver oversees
our operations.

40:11.076 --> 40:14.012
Before I can
be convinced that
your proposal is credible,

40:14.112 --> 40:17.649
he'll need to be convinced
that your proposal
is credible.

40:44.743 --> 40:45.644
It's interesting...

40:45.744 --> 40:47.178
When Richard was a little boy,

40:47.278 --> 40:51.416
there was a tomcat
that lived out in the woods
behind the house.

40:51.517 --> 40:54.720
And it would scratch
at the windows at all
hours of the night.

40:56.221 --> 40:59.725
Richard, all of four years old,

40:59.825 --> 41:03.228
would go outside
still in his nightshirt

41:03.529 --> 41:05.130
and feed it.

41:06.932 --> 41:08.233
My husband disapproved.

41:08.333 --> 41:10.536
He thought it
a sign of weakness.

41:13.772 --> 41:17.408
Given that kindness
is a condition rare
in our family,

41:17.543 --> 41:22.147
I suppose it's unsurprising
that it went misdiagnosed.

41:23.615 --> 41:26.451
So, Richard
would feed the tomcat

41:26.552 --> 41:29.087
and Joseph would flog him
for disobeying,

41:29.187 --> 41:31.857
kick the tomcat for instigating.

41:33.091 --> 41:36.795
But the next night,
the tomcat would return,

41:36.895 --> 41:39.898
and on and on and on it went.

41:41.199 --> 41:44.603
See, none of them
was capable of changing.

41:44.703 --> 41:47.639
The cat a slave to his hunger,

41:47.739 --> 41:52.010
my son to his decency...

41:54.245 --> 41:58.183
my husband to his rage.

41:58.283 --> 42:01.419
That would seem to be
the history of Nassau,
too, wouldn't it?

42:01.620 --> 42:03.822
A cycle of violence

42:03.922 --> 42:07.058
that benefits none
and consumes all.

42:08.660 --> 42:10.596
Suppose the question is

42:10.662 --> 42:14.900
in Nassau's story,
which of these roles
do you play?

42:18.103 --> 42:19.938
I beg your pardon, ma'am.

42:21.206 --> 42:23.609
There are entries
for your wage laborers here,

42:23.675 --> 42:26.745
but I see no accounting
for the others.

42:26.845 --> 42:29.715
I have no other laborers.

42:31.617 --> 42:33.652
Your slaves, ma'am.

42:35.386 --> 42:39.257
I own no slaves
and none work
in my employ.

42:40.859 --> 42:42.628
I see cargo operations,

42:42.661 --> 42:43.771
uh, transportation of sugar,

42:43.795 --> 42:46.231
building, all sorts
of manual labor.

42:46.331 --> 42:47.899
That is correct.

42:47.999 --> 42:49.835
In the Bahamas.

42:49.935 --> 42:52.337
And you pay wages
for all of that?

42:52.437 --> 42:53.972
That doesn't seem
very wise to me.

42:54.072 --> 42:56.742
You are not from Nassau.

42:56.842 --> 42:59.645
In Nassau,
slaves have seen
too many of their own

42:59.711 --> 43:03.314
find freedom amongst
the crews on the account.

43:03.414 --> 43:07.653
It costs less to pay wages
than to replace defectors,

43:07.719 --> 43:11.957
or worse yet,
to pay guards to
watch my door as I sleep.

43:12.057 --> 43:15.160
That isn't
the only reason,
though, is it?

43:19.330 --> 43:21.132
No, it is not.

43:30.909 --> 43:34.212
In my life,
I have been
bought and sold.

43:34.312 --> 43:36.214
And as I would be
no slave again,

43:36.314 --> 43:38.884
and nor would I be a master.

43:43.789 --> 43:46.291
So, how exactly does one rise

43:46.391 --> 43:49.127
from a slave plantation
in the French West Indies

43:49.227 --> 43:52.563
to a library in Philadelphia

43:52.698 --> 43:55.000
trying to remake the world?

43:56.702 --> 43:58.937
What difference does it make?

44:06.111 --> 44:08.714
You are right.

44:08.747 --> 44:11.717
Many men have played
a role in Nassau's story,

44:11.783 --> 44:15.921
but none have been
able to break the cycle
of brutality and failure.

44:17.422 --> 44:18.790
Your granddaughter came as close

44:18.890 --> 44:21.727
as anyone before or since.

44:21.760 --> 44:26.064
But at the end of the day
and despite her best
intentions,

44:26.164 --> 44:29.200
there was one truth
even she was unable to see.

44:30.736 --> 44:32.738
That at some point,

44:32.804 --> 44:37.843
progress cannot begin
and suffering will not end

44:37.943 --> 44:41.079
until someone has the courage
to go out into the woods

44:41.179 --> 44:43.949
and drown the damned cat.

44:49.955 --> 44:52.457
Lend us your help

44:52.557 --> 44:54.625
and we will do
whatever must be done

44:54.826 --> 44:57.128
to move Nassau forward.

45:03.201 --> 45:06.104
I am intrigued by your proposal.

45:07.105 --> 45:08.940
But there is
one question remaining

45:09.040 --> 45:12.110
that you will have to show me
you can adequately answer.

45:18.383 --> 45:21.052
What will you do
when the cat fights back?

45:42.507 --> 45:44.442
It just arrived from Nassau.

45:49.214 --> 45:51.817
She's alive.

45:53.018 --> 45:55.353
Held hostage
by the governor in Nassau.

45:57.322 --> 45:59.290
Unless we bring him the cache

45:59.390 --> 46:02.393
and surrender it to him
by his deadline, she dies.

46:02.493 --> 46:05.296
She's alive.

46:05.396 --> 46:07.265
Who else knows about this?

46:07.365 --> 46:08.934
No one.

46:09.034 --> 46:11.436
I summoned only the two of you.

46:13.004 --> 46:17.708
My daughter is everything to me,

46:17.843 --> 46:19.510
as I believe she is to you.

46:21.346 --> 46:23.681
But that cache is critical
to the success

46:23.849 --> 46:25.183
of the war we're about to begin.

46:25.283 --> 46:26.751
And worse yet,

46:26.852 --> 46:30.055
if it were to be
dug out of the ground
under cover of night,

46:30.155 --> 46:32.958
it would do irreparable damage
to our allies' trust in us.

46:33.058 --> 46:35.927
So, we don't do it
under the cover of night.

46:36.027 --> 46:37.695
We make the argument.

46:37.863 --> 46:39.464
And this isn't just sentiment.

46:39.564 --> 46:43.301
MADI is important to the cause
in her own right.

46:44.602 --> 46:47.338
Some of the men
out there will agree,
and we can...

46:53.078 --> 46:55.480
It doesn't matter
if some of them agree.

46:56.948 --> 46:59.350
You're suggesting
we just refuse?

47:00.385 --> 47:02.553
They'll kill her.

47:02.653 --> 47:06.791
If we even
introduce this question
to the men in this camp,

47:06.892 --> 47:09.594
lines will be drawn,
fighting will ensue.

47:10.929 --> 47:13.164
This alliance is
far too fragile
at this stage

47:13.264 --> 47:16.034
to withstand
that kind of turmoil.

47:18.069 --> 47:21.139
We can pay the ransom
or we can have our war,

47:21.239 --> 47:23.641
but we cannot have both.

47:23.909 --> 47:25.376
A week ago,

47:25.476 --> 47:29.214
you were willing
to trade this money
for a fucking fort.

47:29.314 --> 47:32.383
And now it's too important
to trade for Madi's life?

47:33.418 --> 47:35.153
Things have changed.

47:35.253 --> 47:38.789
Nothing has changed
that justifies trading
her life for your war.

47:38.924 --> 47:41.259
No one is saying
that we let her die.

47:41.359 --> 47:44.529
No? Because that is
certainly what it sounds like.

47:44.629 --> 47:46.932
We will find a way
to get her back.

47:46.998 --> 47:50.101
We just cannot
sacrifice the cache
in order to do it.

47:51.536 --> 47:54.505
Is this war more important
than her life?

47:56.207 --> 47:57.976
Answer the question.

47:59.244 --> 48:01.112
I wanna hear you say it.

48:02.113 --> 48:05.150
Is this war more important
than her life?

48:08.486 --> 48:11.489
Right now
with what's at stake...

48:13.591 --> 48:15.460
yes, it is
more important.
Oh, fuck you! I...

48:15.560 --> 48:18.829
We cannot
permit Woodes Rogers
to divide us like this.

48:18.964 --> 48:20.031
I will not permit it.

48:20.131 --> 48:22.667
MADI would not permit it,
and you know it.

48:22.767 --> 48:25.003
But we're not
going to permit him
to kill her either.

48:25.103 --> 48:29.074
You cannot guarantee that...
We will sail to Nassau
under cover of night.

48:29.174 --> 48:31.977
We will find her.
We will kill anyone
who stands in our way.

48:32.043 --> 48:34.279
And we will bring her home.

48:36.982 --> 48:38.583
When you and I
are of the same mind...

48:40.185 --> 48:43.421
there is nothing
we have not yet
been able to do.

48:45.390 --> 48:47.192
I believe that.

48:48.393 --> 48:49.995
I trust it.

48:51.629 --> 48:53.531
Do you?

49:36.241 --> 49:38.643
I've heard you were with her.

49:41.612 --> 49:43.314
With Eleanor.

49:46.117 --> 49:48.053
How did she die?

49:51.122 --> 49:55.326
What?
Weapons were found
inside the house...

49:56.561 --> 50:00.265
a soldier who was dead
before the fire consumed him.

50:04.802 --> 50:07.538
I'm asking if she died fighting.

50:31.696 --> 50:33.531
What is that?

50:33.631 --> 50:36.434
Terms.

50:38.603 --> 50:41.072
When this is through,
you'll present this
to your people

50:41.172 --> 50:43.108
and advocate to accept them.

50:45.343 --> 50:49.314
Every fugitive slave
in your camp will receive
their immediate emancipation.

50:50.315 --> 50:52.049
With one condition.

50:54.185 --> 50:56.454
Any escaped slave
who seeks refuge with you

50:56.554 --> 50:58.123
after the ratification
of this deal

50:58.223 --> 51:00.325
will be surrendered to the law.

51:01.792 --> 51:05.363
And any pirate at any time
who seeks refuge with you

51:05.463 --> 51:08.466
will be surrendered to the law.

51:10.801 --> 51:14.205
Why would we ever accept that?

51:14.305 --> 51:15.806
Because if you don't,
I will see to it

51:15.906 --> 51:19.444
that every man, woman,
and child in that camp
is put back into chains.

51:19.544 --> 51:21.646
I will see each of them
sold far and wide,

51:21.746 --> 51:23.414
cast out into the world alone.

51:23.514 --> 51:27.552
And then I will burn
everything that remains
to the ground.

51:30.188 --> 51:32.157
From here, your outcomes

51:32.257 --> 51:35.260
are bad or worse.

51:38.496 --> 51:40.831
That's what defeat looks like.

52:08.193 --> 52:10.561
Eleanor died fighting.

52:14.732 --> 52:16.667
As will I.

52:32.850 --> 52:34.419
Thank you.

52:34.519 --> 52:37.822
They're saying
you're heading south
and I'm to stay here.

52:37.922 --> 52:41.326
I can't get
a straight answer
past that.

52:41.426 --> 52:42.793
Sit down.

52:50.501 --> 52:51.836
She agreed.

52:53.404 --> 52:54.872
Madam Guthrie.

52:54.972 --> 52:57.908
Everything we want for Nassau.

52:59.444 --> 53:01.011
Control,

53:01.246 --> 53:02.780
a stake,

53:02.880 --> 53:05.450
Rogers' defeat and humiliation.

53:06.617 --> 53:10.020
There's now a real path
to have it done.

53:10.255 --> 53:12.390
But there is

53:12.490 --> 53:16.060
one final test

53:16.261 --> 53:17.762
to prove our worth

53:17.862 --> 53:19.664
and to lessen
the risk on her end.

53:21.399 --> 53:22.867
What is it?

53:22.967 --> 53:24.869
Flint.

53:26.437 --> 53:29.507
She wants him dead
and she wants me to do it.

53:29.607 --> 53:31.509
Jesus.

53:35.346 --> 53:37.715
On some level,
they can't be blamed.

53:38.749 --> 53:41.286
Flint will stop at nothing

53:41.352 --> 53:43.454
till all the West Indies
are ablaze.

53:44.655 --> 53:47.992
Without him,
our prospects
of success in Nassau

53:48.092 --> 53:51.296
are certainly greatly improved.

53:51.329 --> 53:53.598
And as far as he and I go,

53:53.698 --> 53:55.533
it's not as if
he wouldn't do
the same to me

53:55.633 --> 53:57.502
were the roles reversed.

53:59.103 --> 54:02.873
Jack, how are you gonna do that?

54:03.874 --> 54:05.843
I don't know.

54:06.877 --> 54:08.913
I'll have to find him,

54:09.013 --> 54:11.982
get through
the army of maroons
he calls allies,

54:12.082 --> 54:14.319
get through Long John Silver

54:14.419 --> 54:17.655
and the animal
whose leash he now holds.

54:19.324 --> 54:21.692
And somehow
escape it all alive...

54:23.961 --> 54:25.796
all without you.

54:28.333 --> 54:30.701
But even if you could
do all those things...

54:32.603 --> 54:35.373
I mean, how could you be
someone who would do that?

54:38.175 --> 54:39.753
The world would know
that you were the one

54:39.777 --> 54:42.413
to betray every last one
of our brothers.

54:44.114 --> 54:46.984
Betray the memory
of Charles Vane.

54:50.621 --> 54:52.823
Charles Vane is dead.

54:56.461 --> 54:57.962
I do it for us.

55:00.598 --> 55:03.568
That's how it started.

55:03.668 --> 55:05.570
That's how it's going to end.

55:09.940 --> 55:11.976
We should be going.

55:57.622 --> 56:00.991
You'll, you know...

56:03.428 --> 56:05.129
I will.

56:12.202 --> 56:13.838
Look lively.

56:13.938 --> 56:15.272
Let's get underway.

56:38.696 --> 56:43.468
Seems confident
it's to be done,
doesn't he?

56:44.602 --> 56:47.772
To rescue her
without paying
the governor his ransom.

56:49.740 --> 56:52.477
He is confident in his plan...

56:53.678 --> 56:55.546
as am I.

56:57.882 --> 56:59.083
Maybe.

57:01.218 --> 57:04.822
One of you
is more confident
than the other, I think.

57:05.990 --> 57:07.825
What are you saying?

57:12.162 --> 57:14.064
You're confident in his plan,

57:14.164 --> 57:16.333
maybe because it's a good plan.

57:16.501 --> 57:18.703
Maybe because
it's the only plan.

57:18.803 --> 57:23.107
But maybe it's just because
if his plan don't succeed,

57:23.207 --> 57:26.110
you'll have to show him
that you prepared
for the failure.

57:28.045 --> 57:30.581
That the world
ain't gonna be
what he wanted.

57:32.683 --> 57:35.853
And that a treasure
he wanted left in the ground

57:35.953 --> 57:38.656
ain't in the ground no more.

57:44.929 --> 57:47.364
And when that happens

57:47.532 --> 57:49.967
and the extreme reaction
follows,

57:50.067 --> 57:52.837
it's one of two roads ahead.

57:52.937 --> 57:56.741
You're either
gonna have to concede
and let him have his way...

57:58.308 --> 58:00.878
or you're
gonna have to kill him.

58:02.246 --> 58:04.682
You know this, don't you?
