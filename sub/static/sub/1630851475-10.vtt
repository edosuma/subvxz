WEBVTT

00:00.792 --> 00:02.544
(light music)

00:02.627 --> 00:05.422
MAN: <i>Previously on </i>Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.<i></i>

00:06.256 --> 00:07.799
DR. LEE:
<i>She's like a real-life, Doogie Howser.</i>

00:07.882 --> 00:09.050
That's why we call her Doogie.

00:09.134 --> 00:11.886
LAHELA: <i>And tomorrow night at the dance
will be my first date with Walter.</i>

00:11.970 --> 00:13.763
Oh, you never forget a night of firsts.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.223
LAHELA: <i>I want a night like that.</i>

00:15.306 --> 00:16.182
Lahela, what is it?

00:16.266 --> 00:17.308
You can talk to me.

00:18.059 --> 00:19.352
Oh, you're leaving?

00:19.436 --> 00:21.438
Yeah, the only bummer is
I need to find my replacement.

00:21.521 --> 00:24.315
You'd be great, but you got
your hands full doing your mom thing.

00:24.399 --> 00:27.027
LAHELA: <i>I just don't think he sees you
as dating material.</i>

00:27.110 --> 00:30.196
BENNY: <i>Whoa, Uncle. It's always great
to come back here to where I grew up.</i>

00:30.280 --> 00:31.823
Coming here always recharges me.

00:31.906 --> 00:34.200
I didn't know what to say when you asked
what I wanted to do with my life.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.327
No. I shouldn't have put that on you.

00:36.411 --> 00:40.123
LAHELA: <i>It's just hard for me sometimes
because my life's been so different.</i>

00:40.206 --> 00:44.044
Being a great mom means living your life
as an example for your kids.

00:44.127 --> 00:47.797
I can't tell you to be you
if I'm not being me.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.841
I wanna be considered for Chief of Staff.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.509
Great. Consider yourself in the running.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.595
Your brother is the perfect man.
I'm a catch.

00:53.678 --> 00:54.554
STEPH: <i>One day, he'll realize that,</i>

00:54.637 --> 00:56.014
<i>and we'll spend
the rest of our lives together.</i>

00:56.097 --> 00:59.142
Your dad is the one that taught me
how to play the ukelele.

00:59.225 --> 01:00.894
He's the last one of that generation.

01:00.977 --> 01:03.063
The last one that I can talk-story
about my dad.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.939
I love you, Lahela.

01:05.023 --> 01:06.274
I love you, too.

01:06.357 --> 01:07.400
That was the Global Surf League.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.736
They want me to join the tour
this summer in Australia.

01:09.819 --> 01:11.905
(light music continues)

01:14.532 --> 01:15.408
(clicks)

01:16.201 --> 01:19.412
(theme music)

01:46.231 --> 01:49.275
(percussive music)

01:52.695 --> 01:54.948
(grunts, pants)

01:55.740 --> 01:58.785
I put Elsa in the window two minutes
and thirty-eight seconds ago.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.078
That's your new personal best.

02:00.161 --> 02:01.204
What's the big news?

02:01.287 --> 02:02.664
Who says I have big news?

02:03.081 --> 02:05.667
Oh, come on, Elsa's been our Bat-Signal
since we were kids.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.544
Last time you used her,
you got into med school.

02:07.627 --> 02:10.380
Spill that tea, girl.
I pushed our mailman down to get here.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.007
I'm going with Walter to Australia!

02:13.591 --> 02:17.137
-(both screaming)
-Oh, my god, Lahela!

02:17.220 --> 02:21.141
I saw online they were taking applications
for a surf medic, so I applied.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.726
And I got the job.

02:23.810 --> 02:24.936
I'm so excited.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.813
I'm gonna throw up. I'm gonna pass out.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.731
I'm gonna throw up
and then I'm gonna pass out.

02:28.815 --> 02:29.983
-Okay.
-This is exactly how I felt

02:30.066 --> 02:31.526
after Kai kissed me at the party.

02:31.609 --> 02:33.945
-Hmm.
-Wait, you're really going to Australia?

02:34.028 --> 02:35.280
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

02:35.363 --> 02:37.866
-(gasps)
-And the staff and the surfers get to stay

02:37.949 --> 02:39.993
in these cute little camper vans
along the coast,

02:40.076 --> 02:42.912
and stop at tournament sites
from Sydney to Perth.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.747
That's so romantic.

02:46.040 --> 02:49.127
(romantic music on guitar)

02:49.252 --> 02:52.172
<i>♪ You and I together ♪</i>

02:52.255 --> 02:58.636
<i>♪ Let me take you away, take you away ♪</i>

02:58.720 --> 03:00.597
<i>♪ Oh ♪</i>

03:00.680 --> 03:01.890
He wrote that song for you?

03:02.473 --> 03:04.267
In my fantasy, he did.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.311
And during the walkabout,

03:06.394 --> 03:09.022
he lifted me onto a rock,
so I could get a better view.

03:09.105 --> 03:12.609
Aww, I wanna be lifted.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.320
Wait. What do your parents think
about all this?

03:15.403 --> 03:16.404
Ooh.

03:16.487 --> 03:21.492
Well, I haven't exactly told them yet
because they'd completely freak out.

03:21.993 --> 03:25.580
It's delicate. I just need to figure out
the best way to do it and when...

03:25.663 --> 03:26.831
Knock, knock!

03:27.916 --> 03:29.209
Hey, Steph!

03:29.292 --> 03:30.710
Join us for breakfast.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.337
(clatters)

03:33.171 --> 03:35.882
I made my special scrambled eggs
with Portuguese sausage.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.302
The secret is I slice on the diagonal.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.429
Thanks, Dad. Be down in a minute.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.016
That was close.

03:45.808 --> 03:48.228
Mr. Hsiao is flying in today.

03:48.311 --> 03:51.105
He's deciding this week
about the new Chief of Staff.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.441
It's either me or Dr. Lee.

03:53.524 --> 03:54.484
You'll get it, Mom.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.736
And if you need a rec
to put you over the top,

03:56.819 --> 03:58.404
I'd be happy to make some calls.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.031
(chuckles)

04:01.449 --> 04:04.160
I'll help shift the convo
and then you swoop in with your big news.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.203
LAHELA: Mm.

04:05.662 --> 04:08.748
Wow, Mr. Kamealoha, this is delicious.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.917
Do I taste Vegemite?

04:11.000 --> 04:13.044
-Nope. Just eggs and sausage.
-STEPH: Hmm.

04:13.461 --> 04:15.171
-What's Vegemite?
-STEPH: Um...

04:15.255 --> 04:17.382
Just something people eat in Australia.

04:17.465 --> 04:19.217
Cool. Thanks for letting me know.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.886
Honey, I'm gonna take some of the sausage
to Uncle John today.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.930
Uh, how's Uncle John doing
in the hospital?

04:24.013 --> 04:25.014
Restless.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.724
We should visit him as a family sometime.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.476
Even if it's just
to watch <i>Jeopardy!</i> with him.

04:28.559 --> 04:33.773
Nicole Kidman, Paul Hogan, and ‘90s group
Midnight Oil all hail from this country.

04:33.856 --> 04:36.609
Why are you so obsessed with Australia?

04:37.193 --> 04:39.862
No clue. Just Steph being Steph.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.155
(chuckles)

04:41.239 --> 04:44.784
Well, I better get going if I wanna get
some face time with Mr. Hsiao

04:44.867 --> 04:47.787
before Dr. Lee sinks his hooks into him.

04:47.870 --> 04:50.540
The early bird breaks the glass ceiling.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.250
You got this. We believe in you.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.793
-Go, Mom.
-Go off, queen.

04:53.876 --> 04:54.877
(chuckles)

04:55.003 --> 04:56.296
Boys, grab the plates.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.548
-(glass clinking)
-Oh, thank you.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.800
-LAHELA: Thanks.
-KAI: Yeah.

05:02.176 --> 05:03.094
What is wrong with you?

05:03.177 --> 05:04.512
I could ask you the same thing.

05:04.595 --> 05:07.473
I can't bring it up until I figure out
how to frame my argument.

05:07.557 --> 05:08.433
That is the key.

05:08.516 --> 05:11.561
It's how I got Brazil to give
its entire orange crop to Iceland

05:11.644 --> 05:13.521
at Model UN when I was seven.

05:13.604 --> 05:14.897
I remember that summer.

05:14.981 --> 05:18.860
You went to a Model UN competition
and my mom sent me away to chess camp.

05:18.943 --> 05:21.946
I don't know how to play
but I made out with a lot of nerds.

05:24.032 --> 05:28.411
Okay. Patient needs a CT scan,
full panel, C spine and...

05:28.494 --> 05:29.829
(ring tone)

05:29.912 --> 05:31.289
Oh, sorry.

05:31.372 --> 05:32.415
New ring tone.

05:33.499 --> 05:36.919
-Sorry.
-That's okay, but keep it on silent.

05:37.003 --> 05:40.673
The head of the board is visiting today
and we need to make a good impression.

05:41.299 --> 05:45.636
ALL: <i>♪ 'Ae... E ke akua ♪</i>

05:46.220 --> 05:52.352
<i>♪ E aloha mai 'oe i ku'u aloha ♪</i>

05:52.435 --> 05:57.732
<i>♪ E ola no ho'i i ka pua ane ane a ♪</i>

05:58.316 --> 06:03.488
<i>♪ Ke ola iā 'oe, e ku'u aloha ♪</i>

06:04.155 --> 06:09.077
<i>♪ Aloha e ♪</i>

06:13.915 --> 06:15.375
That's beautiful.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.543
Someone got a little pitchy.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.003
(all laugh)

06:19.087 --> 06:20.713
<i>Mahalo</i> everyone else.

06:20.797 --> 06:21.714
(all chuckle)

06:21.798 --> 06:23.674
Uncle John's back to busting my chops.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.636
-I guess the healing chant worked.
-(all laugh)

06:26.719 --> 06:30.014
Charles, Noelani,
this is Auntie Mabel, Auntie Suzie,

06:30.098 --> 06:33.101
Uncle Peter, Benny's cousin R.T.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.727
<i>Aloha.</i>

06:35.478 --> 06:36.604
<i>Aloha.</i>

06:37.438 --> 06:38.731
<i>Aloha.</i>

06:39.315 --> 06:41.192
The family came by so we could figure out

06:41.275 --> 06:43.277
what everyone's bringing
for Kamehameha Day.

06:43.361 --> 06:44.654
What's that?

06:44.737 --> 06:47.365
A holiday celebrating King Kamehameha.

06:47.448 --> 06:51.536
He was the great chief that united
the Hawaiian Islands into one kingdom.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.538
(whispers) It's a big day in Hawaii.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.915
Our family celebrates
by having a potluck at Uncle's ranch.

06:56.624 --> 06:57.834
Hey, you guys should come.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.211
BENNY:
Uncle John makes the best kālua pig.

07:00.294 --> 07:01.629
He builds an imu.

07:01.712 --> 07:04.507
It's an underground oven,
and the pig is steamed and smoked.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.301
The meat comes out so tender,
it just falls apart.

07:07.385 --> 07:11.472
He just had a major procedure.
I'm not sure he can make it this year.

07:11.556 --> 07:14.183
But Uncle John's never missed
the Kamehameha Day.

07:15.059 --> 07:16.561
JOHN: That's okay, Benny.

07:16.644 --> 07:19.021
Just bring me a big plate after.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.898
(all laugh)

07:20.982 --> 07:22.483
DR. LEE: Tiger Woods won
the Masters 'cause the Asians...

07:22.567 --> 07:24.235
Uh, excuse me a sec.

07:27.071 --> 07:29.949
Mr. Hsiao, how was your flight?

07:30.032 --> 07:32.618
Like Dr. Lee's drives. Super long.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.120
(chuckles)
I'm sorry?

07:34.203 --> 07:36.914
Dr. Lee picked me up from the airport.
We went straight to the golf course.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.250
-This guy can hit it a mile.
-(Dr. Lee chuckles)

07:39.333 --> 07:42.086
What about that 20-foot putt
you suck at 11, huh?

07:42.170 --> 07:43.379
BOTH: Drain-o!

07:43.463 --> 07:44.672
Fun.

07:44.755 --> 07:48.718
How about a tour of the hospital
and then lunch in the cafeteria?

07:49.177 --> 07:51.220
It's gazpacho day.
(chuckles)

07:52.263 --> 07:53.973
Dr. Lee's gonna take me to Sasabune.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.601
But let's get that tour
on the books later this week.

07:56.684 --> 07:57.518
Sounds good.

07:57.602 --> 07:58.728
-DR. LEE: Mm-hmm.
-(chuckles)

07:59.520 --> 08:00.730
That's your move?

08:00.813 --> 08:01.939
Cold-ass ketchup soup?

08:02.023 --> 08:04.108
Better get used to calling me Chief.

08:04.192 --> 08:07.069
First thing I'm gonna do here
is fire everyone who doubted me.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.198
And then, I'm gonna hire them back
because we've been grossly understaffed.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.284
(Hawaiian music)

08:14.327 --> 08:16.537
I guess since Uncle John
might not make it to the potluck,

08:16.621 --> 08:18.080
you'll be on kālua pig duty.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.041
I'm not doing it. That's Uncle's job.

08:20.124 --> 08:21.876
Someone's gonna have to imu the pig.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.796
-Uh, we could order a bunch of pizzas.
-BENNY: We're not ordering pizzas.

08:26.380 --> 08:28.216
The potluck's still a couple of days off.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.218
Uncle will be better by then.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.804
I'm sorry, babe. But based on his labs,
it doesn't look good.

08:33.888 --> 08:37.183
We'll see. Not everything can be measured
by tests and charts.

08:37.266 --> 08:41.062
Well, unfortunately, as his doctor,
I go by the data.

08:41.145 --> 08:45.233
And he needs to be in the hospital
for another week at least.

08:46.567 --> 08:47.443
We'll see.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.323
LAHELA: Mom? Dad? Can I see you for a sec?

08:54.158 --> 08:54.992
Aww.

08:55.117 --> 08:59.288
She's playing with the little Model UN set
you built for her.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.706
Hello, fellow member nations.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.500
Thank you for joining me.
Please have a seat.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.044
CLARA: Mm.
(giggles)

09:05.795 --> 09:10.716
The Commonwealth of Australia is more
than just didgeridoos and kangaroos.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.052
It has the 13th largest economy,

09:13.135 --> 09:17.848
and tenth highest per capita income
with a thriving tourism industry.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.768
Eight point six million people
visit every year.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.689
And I wanna be one of those people.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.774
This summer. With Walter.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.361
Like, to visit?

09:30.444 --> 09:31.654
To go for the summer.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.617
But before you guys say no,
let me present my case.

09:37.243 --> 09:41.330
Growing up, while Kai and Brian Patrick
went to sleepaway camp,

09:41.414 --> 09:45.042
I always spent those months
doing something to further my education.

09:45.126 --> 09:46.669
I've never had a summer vacation.

09:47.169 --> 09:49.046
What about the time
we all went to Disney World?

09:49.130 --> 09:51.424
There's that great photo
of the five of us hanging in the hall.

09:51.507 --> 09:52.508
I'm not in that.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.553
That's just some random girl that Kai met
waiting in line for Space Mountain.

09:55.636 --> 09:58.806
I was at an Orlando
cardiovascular seminar.

09:58.889 --> 10:01.976
What about the summer we visited
Grandma and Grandpa in Philly?

10:02.059 --> 10:03.603
Pre-med program at Penn.

10:03.686 --> 10:05.980
-Camping at the Grand Canyon?
-Mayo Clinic in Arizona.

10:06.063 --> 10:07.315
Hiking in Colorado?

10:07.398 --> 10:08.858
Denver watching a heart transplant.

10:09.483 --> 10:12.445
Well, we're not monsters.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.905
You asked us
to take you to those programs.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.241
I know and thank you.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.910
But this summer, I wanna go to Australia.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.207
Wait, Dad, you would love it.

10:25.291 --> 10:29.337
Me and Walter get to stay in camper vans
on the beach... together.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.922
No, nope, no.

10:32.006 --> 10:35.259
You're not going with your boyfriend
to Australia at 16.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.218
You're way too young.

10:36.844 --> 10:39.388
But, Dad, I'm not a kid anymore.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.723
I'm a doctor.

10:40.806 --> 10:43.726
I make my own money, I can drive.
I'm basically an adult.

10:43.851 --> 10:44.685
But you're not.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.771
The trip will also be educational.

10:46.854 --> 10:49.607
I'll be a medic,
gaining real-world experience.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.025
Treating sunburns?

10:51.108 --> 10:54.904
Lahela, you can't leave residency now.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.990
It makes no sense
to take a two-month detour.

10:58.074 --> 11:00.451
-(stutters) But it wouldn't...
-Our answer is no.

11:00.534 --> 11:02.328
(dramatic music)

11:04.413 --> 11:06.624
(waves crashing)

11:09.627 --> 11:11.003
This sucks.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.214
Just want to be free and live my own life.

11:13.964 --> 11:17.009
-How did Walter take it?
-Ugh. I haven't told him yet.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.261
We were so excited
to be doing this together,

11:19.345 --> 11:22.890
and the thought of
backing out on him, I feel terrible.

11:22.973 --> 11:25.059
So, I've been avoiding him for days.

11:25.142 --> 11:27.853
-You know that's not the answer, girl.
-I know.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.939
(rumbles)

11:30.690 --> 11:33.609
(light music)

11:35.736 --> 11:37.029
Time to woman up.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.614
Wish me luck.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.993
(light music continues)

11:44.203 --> 11:45.037
(exhales)

11:49.417 --> 11:50.459
Hey, Lahela! Howzit?

11:50.876 --> 11:51.919
Not great.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.629
Bad actually.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.256
Oh, my gosh, I totally forgot.

11:56.465 --> 11:57.800
Hold that thought.

11:58.175 --> 11:59.969
This will cheer you up.

12:01.053 --> 12:04.682
Okay, you're not gonna believe this,
but I pictured us on the beach

12:04.765 --> 12:07.226
-with mugs exactly like that.
-Now, check out the best part.

12:08.018 --> 12:09.228
I shipped our names.

12:09.729 --> 12:13.232
I debated Walela,
but we're totally Lahalter, right? Here.

12:16.026 --> 12:18.112
Oh, sorry, I interrupted you.
What were you gonna say?

12:20.823 --> 12:21.991
I can't...

12:25.411 --> 12:27.079
wait to go to Australia.

12:28.289 --> 12:32.334
(light music)

12:35.755 --> 12:37.465
Happy Kamehameha Day, Uncle.

12:37.548 --> 12:39.717
Yeah, we brought you some more mangoes.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.887
<i>-Mahalo.</i>
-So... how's your recovery going?

12:42.970 --> 12:44.472
Are you gonna make it to the potluck?

12:44.555 --> 12:46.807
I hate being cooped up in here.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.977
But I need to stay a few more days.

12:50.853 --> 12:53.439
So, you're in charge of the kālua pig.

12:53.522 --> 12:55.524
No, no, that... that's your job.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.360
The first thing to do is to dig an imu.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.614
Next, you'll need
to harvest banana tree leaves.

13:01.697 --> 13:03.282
That's where you get the moisture.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.451
Why aren't you writing this down?

13:06.619 --> 13:07.828
Don't need to.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.455
You're gonna cook it yourself.

13:09.538 --> 13:11.081
(chuckles)
Like always.

13:13.793 --> 13:17.087
-(Hsiao imitates dog panting)
-(Clara chuckles)

13:17.588 --> 13:21.467
You can see why therapy dogs
are such a big hit with pediatrics.

13:21.550 --> 13:24.011
I implemented the program two years ago.

13:24.094 --> 13:25.721
Or 14 dog years ago.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.722
(chuckles)

13:26.806 --> 13:29.183
-It's a smart way to connect to kids.
-Mm-hmm.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.895
-Thank you so much.
-VET: Mm-hmm.

13:34.688 --> 13:36.273
Uh, did you have pets growing up?

13:36.357 --> 13:38.943
Yep. Two cats. Pat and Geno.

13:39.026 --> 13:41.487
Named after rival cheesesteak places
in Philly.

13:41.570 --> 13:44.198
And just like the restaurants,
they were mortal enemies.

13:44.281 --> 13:45.282
(both chuckle)

13:45.366 --> 13:47.993
Well, I really like the improvements
you've made to the hospital.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.204
Thank you. I...

13:50.704 --> 13:52.081
Um...

13:52.581 --> 13:54.750
I need to check in on a patient.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.460
I'll meet you in the cafeteria.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.128
-(chuckles)
-Sounds good.

13:59.213 --> 14:00.464
(sighs)

14:02.967 --> 14:06.053
(mysterious music)

14:08.681 --> 14:12.101
(man snoring)

14:12.935 --> 14:13.769
CLARA: Brian Patrick?

14:13.853 --> 14:14.854
What are you doing?

14:14.937 --> 14:16.021
Uh, dad made me do it.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.898
Do what exactly?

14:17.982 --> 14:19.441
One, pretend to be Uncle John asleep.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.236
Two, wait until after rounds.
Three, meet in the lobby.

14:22.319 --> 14:24.196
-Four, don't tell Mom...
-(groans)

14:24.280 --> 14:25.948
Oh, boy.
(sharp exhale)

14:27.533 --> 14:30.870
(suspenseful music)

14:35.541 --> 14:36.792
BENNY: Go, go.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.253
Almost home free, Uncle.
(chuckles)

14:39.336 --> 14:41.338
Going somewhere?

14:41.422 --> 14:44.550
No. Is this way to the gift shop?
I always get turned around.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.218
Brian Patrick told me everything.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.888
I knew we should have
just put pillows under the covers

14:48.971 --> 14:50.180
but no, you wanted snoring.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.516
I voted to <i>Die Hard</i> through the air ducts.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.435
What are you doing, Benny?

14:54.518 --> 14:56.395
Busting him out of the hospital?

14:56.478 --> 14:58.230
He needs to be back at his ranch.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.691
Is this because you're nervous
about cooking a pig?

15:00.774 --> 15:03.527
(sighs)
Uncle John needs to recover.

15:03.611 --> 15:04.778
That's just it.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.947
The thing that will help him recover
is his ranch.

15:07.656 --> 15:11.285
There's Hawaiian saying,
<i>"Ka lā i ka Mauliola."</i>

15:11.368 --> 15:13.495
The sun is a source of life.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.331
This place is no good for him.

15:15.414 --> 15:19.293
Recirculating air, sterile hallways,
windows that don't open?

15:19.960 --> 15:22.296
He needs to be outside,
surrounded by nature.

15:22.379 --> 15:23.714
That's where he thrives.

15:23.797 --> 15:26.258
He needs that to heal.

15:28.135 --> 15:31.555
He can go back to his ranch
after he recovers.

15:37.227 --> 15:38.562
(dings)

15:40.230 --> 15:41.190
You guys,

15:41.273 --> 15:42.399
mom knows.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.321
Where's Uncle John?

15:50.407 --> 15:51.951
(Clara sighs)

15:55.371 --> 15:57.289
Sorry, busy hospital.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.749
There's always something.
(chuckles)

15:58.832 --> 16:01.794
I'll bet. Especially now
that you're gonna be down a doctor.

16:01.877 --> 16:04.797
Or should I say, down under a doctor?

16:04.880 --> 16:06.715
(chuckles)
What?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.550
Oh, Dr. Kamealoha asked the board

16:08.634 --> 16:11.178
if she could take a two-month sabbatical
to go to Australia.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.431
Right.

16:14.515 --> 16:15.808
I knew that.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.435
Everybody out.

16:19.895 --> 16:22.314
Not you, Dr. Kamealoha.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.607
I'd like a word.

16:28.737 --> 16:29.738
LAHELA: What's up?

16:29.822 --> 16:33.534
Did you really think you could go
over my head to the board

16:33.617 --> 16:35.160
and I wouldn't find out?

16:35.744 --> 16:37.371
You're not going to Australia.

16:37.454 --> 16:39.623
-That's not fair. I do everything right.
-(sighs)

16:39.707 --> 16:42.376
I am a good kid
and I just want this one thing.

16:42.459 --> 16:43.627
You're 16.

16:43.711 --> 16:48.215
You can't just run off with your boyfriend
to some former penal colony.

16:48.298 --> 16:49.717
This isn't about Walter.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.885
I wanna travel.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.053
See the world.

16:53.137 --> 16:56.098
I mean,
I lived my whole life on this island.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.392
I just want new experiences.

16:58.475 --> 17:02.354
Okay. Two months is a long time
to be on your own,

17:02.438 --> 17:04.189
away from your mom and dad.

17:04.273 --> 17:08.152
I'm not some dumb irresponsible kid
who makes bad choices.

17:08.235 --> 17:11.488
I make life or death decisions every day.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.742
And I get that you're my parents, but...

17:15.284 --> 17:17.745
last time I checked, I'm still a doctor.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.333
You wanna play it that way? Fine.

17:24.251 --> 17:27.254
Last time I checked,
I'm still your boss, doctor.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.089
Request denied.

17:29.715 --> 17:30.924
(scoffs)

17:37.139 --> 17:38.307
Then, I quit.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.892
-No, Lahela...
-Yes.

17:39.975 --> 17:41.310
(sighs)

17:42.478 --> 17:44.563
(metal clanking)

17:45.689 --> 17:46.774
KAI: You know, for some reason,

17:46.857 --> 17:48.609
I thought digging an imu
would be more fun than this.

17:49.401 --> 17:53.405
Okay, the pit's deep enough.
We just gotta figure out the right length.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.657
Uncle John said it depends
on the size of the pig.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.452
Well, let's throw the pig in there
and see how it fits.

17:58.952 --> 18:00.662
BENNY: Nah, it's so heavy.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.623
It'd be better if we had something
the same size.

18:02.706 --> 18:08.378
Oh yeah, like,
something we could use as a... proxy.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.255
What's a proxy?

18:10.339 --> 18:12.049
Lie in the hole and I'll tell you.

18:12.966 --> 18:13.801
(sighs)

18:13.884 --> 18:17.429
You guys are making me do
something weird again?

18:17.513 --> 18:18.680
(Brian sighs)

18:18.764 --> 18:20.182
I'm a person.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.393
-KAI: Mm-hmm.
-(Brian sighs)

18:23.477 --> 18:26.105
-(Kai chuckles)
-BENNY: All the way.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.731
(exhales)

18:29.608 --> 18:31.985
(groans)
This is all of my nightmares.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.196
-The pig will fit.
-Yeah.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.407
For the record, I wanted pizza.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.079
I can't believe you're leaving.

18:42.162 --> 18:43.705
I know it wasn't an easy decision.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.165
But I totally get it.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.583
-You do?
-Yeah.

18:46.667 --> 18:49.878
My mom, my dad, and all my siblings
went to the University of Hawaii.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.338
But I needed to blaze my own trail,

18:51.421 --> 18:54.591
exercise my independence,
so I went to school in North Carolina.

18:54.675 --> 18:58.512
I knew I heard you say y'all.
You said I had swimmer's ear.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.097
Did you make the right choice?

19:00.180 --> 19:03.851
I was an island girl
4,788 miles away from home.

19:03.934 --> 19:08.021
The pollen wreaked havoc on my allergies
and nobody knew what Spam musubi was.

19:08.605 --> 19:11.525
But, yeah, I made the right choice.

19:13.694 --> 19:14.611
Thanks.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.322
Oh, I'm gonna miss you guys.

19:17.406 --> 19:20.450
(soft sigh)
Honey, we're gonna miss you.

19:20.534 --> 19:23.245
But I am loving this fearless look on you.

19:23.328 --> 19:26.165
Reminds me when I packed my bags
and left Chicago.

19:27.374 --> 19:28.625
That's how I met all of you.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.337
Best decision of my life.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.131
Y'all come back now, ya hear?

19:35.465 --> 19:36.592
Oh, guys.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.427
-(Noelani giggles)
-Oh.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.596
<i>Aloha.</i>

19:40.679 --> 19:41.889
Well, the goodbye one.

19:41.972 --> 19:44.016
You can just say <i>"aloha."</i>

19:44.099 --> 19:45.142
(all chuckle)

19:45.225 --> 19:46.435
(Charles sniffles)

19:47.060 --> 19:49.688
Hey, I'm glad I caught you
before you left.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.481
(breathes deeply)

19:51.773 --> 19:54.902
This hospital is not going to be the same
without you, Doogie.

19:55.569 --> 19:56.820
You're a great doctor.

19:56.904 --> 20:00.032
And you're not just saying that
because you won't have anyone to nickname

20:00.115 --> 20:01.742
after a '90s TV show anymore?

20:02.409 --> 20:04.453
No, you really are a great doctor.

20:04.536 --> 20:09.374
And besides, I still got Will and Grace.
(chuckles)

20:10.250 --> 20:11.293
(Noelani chuckles)

20:11.376 --> 20:12.252
Thank you.

20:13.337 --> 20:16.298
Really, guys, I mean, for everything. I...

20:16.381 --> 20:17.841
-WOMAN (on PA): <i>Blue team, to ICU.</i>
-That's us. We gotta...

20:17.925 --> 20:20.385
-Yeah. Yeah, go.
-<i>Blue team to ICU.</i>

20:20.469 --> 20:22.638
(somber music)

20:31.021 --> 20:34.358
(indistinct PA chatter)

20:41.907 --> 20:44.701
(somber music continues)

20:50.082 --> 20:51.833
(both chuckle)

20:53.585 --> 20:56.004
This is a nice surprise.
Thought you're working today.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.340
I was, but I quit.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.384
Wait, what? Why?

21:00.467 --> 21:04.638
Well, my parents said
I wasn't allowed to go, but it's my life.

21:05.597 --> 21:08.976
And my mom wouldn't give me
two months' leave, so I quit.

21:09.059 --> 21:12.562
Well, I don't want you
to give up your passion for the surf tour.

21:13.188 --> 21:14.439
You love being a doctor.

21:14.523 --> 21:17.401
It's who you are.
You'd miss it like crazy.

21:22.322 --> 21:24.449
Yeah, I just won't go on the tour.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.119
No, I... can't ask you to do that.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.204
You didn't. It was my idea.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.999
I can always qualify next year.

21:32.082 --> 21:33.959
Your boyfriend's got skills, huh?

21:35.002 --> 21:36.211
I love you.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.462
I love you, too.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.215
(gentle music)

21:41.967 --> 21:44.303
(crowd cheer)

21:46.096 --> 21:47.347
(laughs)

21:47.472 --> 21:50.767
I haven't been this happy
since I saw Obama body surfing.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.769
Oh. Yes, he can.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.313
(both giggle)

21:55.355 --> 21:57.566
-Go inside.
-(laughs)

21:57.649 --> 22:00.319
(gentle music continues)

22:00.402 --> 22:02.988
(indistinct chatter)

22:06.450 --> 22:07.409
Hey.

22:08.660 --> 22:13.206
We haven't really talked since,
you know, all that stuff went down.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.292
You mean at Walter's party?

22:15.375 --> 22:16.376
Yeah.

22:17.044 --> 22:19.171
It was just... so crazy.

22:22.507 --> 22:26.386
That we, you know,
messed up Walter's cake that badly,

22:26.470 --> 22:28.638
and he didn't even get mad, right?

22:29.723 --> 22:30.682
Yeah.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.559
Right.

22:33.435 --> 22:34.770
(chuckles)

22:36.730 --> 22:39.316
(calm music)

22:46.573 --> 22:47.741
Hey, uh...

22:48.241 --> 22:50.702
Just so you have all the information,

22:50.786 --> 22:53.872
my doctor said a growth spurt
is coming very soon.

22:53.955 --> 22:54.790
(soft chuckle)

22:56.750 --> 22:58.168
He doesn't deserve you.

23:02.839 --> 23:04.383
Thanks, Brian Patrick.

23:08.845 --> 23:11.181
<i>Aloha!</i>

23:11.264 --> 23:13.433
-<i>Aloha,</i> uncle. <i>Aloha,</i> aunties.
-Hey, guys.

23:13.517 --> 23:15.310
I hope I brought enough mac salad.

23:15.894 --> 23:18.021
I think we're good.
(chuckles)

23:18.897 --> 23:22.192
<i>Aloha,</i> R.T.
I made my famous Lomi Lomi salmon.

23:23.151 --> 23:25.737
I'm from the Midwest,
so I made an ambrosia salad.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.489
It's the food of the Gods.

23:28.949 --> 23:31.743
Your Gods must like a lot of marshmallow.

23:31.827 --> 23:34.955
-(chuckles)
-I can't wait to try it.

23:36.164 --> 23:38.208
(background chatter)

23:38.959 --> 23:39.835
Hmm.

23:40.335 --> 23:42.170
I'm already spoken for.

23:42.838 --> 23:43.964
Really?

23:44.923 --> 23:46.299
Give me that salad.

23:51.763 --> 23:54.057
KAI: This is awesome. Congrats, Dad.

23:54.141 --> 23:55.100
Way to step up.

23:55.183 --> 23:57.394
Thanks. It wasn't that hard.

23:57.477 --> 23:59.354
Then how come you didn't wanna do it?

24:00.063 --> 24:01.398
I guess it's...

24:02.858 --> 24:04.651
I guess it's because
it's Uncle John's thing.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.696
When you take
someone's role in the family,

24:07.779 --> 24:09.072
it means they're gone.

24:09.156 --> 24:10.574
(wind gusting)

24:11.450 --> 24:13.034
I'm not ready to say goodbye.

24:15.787 --> 24:19.040
-Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.
-(chuckles)

24:20.125 --> 24:23.587
-You're out of the hospital?
-I discharged him under my care.

24:24.337 --> 24:25.755
And your advice.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.133
Thanks, babe.

24:30.594 --> 24:32.471
You're not replacing me anytime soon.

24:33.013 --> 24:36.683
You forgot to put the pig
in the imu, lolo.

24:38.685 --> 24:40.770
(laughs)

24:45.150 --> 24:48.236
(calm music continues)

24:53.575 --> 24:54.868
(Clara chuckles)

24:56.369 --> 24:57.204
Hey, Mom.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.164
Hey.

25:00.790 --> 25:03.084
I wanted to talk to you about today.

25:03.710 --> 25:04.794
Me too.

25:08.131 --> 25:11.176
There comes a day
in every teenage girl's life

25:11.259 --> 25:14.804
where her mom can no longer influence her.

25:15.430 --> 25:20.227
She becomes her own woman,
and she is gonna do what she wants.

25:20.936 --> 25:24.648
For me, it was when my mom
wouldn't let me live down

25:24.731 --> 25:26.775
at the Jersey Shore for a summer.
(chuckles)

25:28.235 --> 25:31.238
For you, that day was today.

25:32.447 --> 25:37.035
It's your life and you need to do
what's right for you.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.330
You can go to Australia.

25:42.415 --> 25:43.542
Thank you.

25:44.584 --> 25:45.585
(soft chuckle)

25:47.754 --> 25:50.257
But I'm not going to Australia.

25:51.299 --> 25:54.844
-What?
-I love working at the hospital.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.347
And I'd miss it too much.

25:58.056 --> 26:02.060
And Walter decided to give up the tour
to spend the summer here with me.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.188
-Wow.
-So...

26:06.731 --> 26:08.233
can I have my job back?

26:09.317 --> 26:13.905
Of course, welcome back, Dr. Kamealoha.
(chuckles)

26:14.531 --> 26:15.949
Thanks, Mom.

26:16.032 --> 26:17.117
CLARA: Mm.

26:18.994 --> 26:21.955
So what made you changed your mind
about discharging Uncle John?

26:22.038 --> 26:23.248
(chuckles)

26:24.374 --> 26:28.336
When I was little,
I had two cats, Pat and Geno.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.921
Complete opposites.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.548
Pat was an indoor cat.

26:31.631 --> 26:33.133
Geno was an outdoor cat.

26:33.216 --> 26:35.760
During the day,
he would roam the neighborhood.

26:36.803 --> 26:41.850
And I tried a bunch of times to get him
to stay inside, but he hated it.

26:41.933 --> 26:45.979
Geno was at his best
when he was surrounded by nature.

26:46.980 --> 26:48.273
Like Uncle John.

26:48.356 --> 26:49.566
That's right.

26:49.649 --> 26:54.487
Your dad helped remind me
that Uncle John is an outdoor cat.

26:54.571 --> 26:58.199
And you can't keep an outdoor cat inside.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.243
No matter how much you want to.

27:00.744 --> 27:03.788
They need to be where they can thrive.

27:04.372 --> 27:05.624
(Clara chuckles)

27:06.791 --> 27:07.751
(horse snorts)

27:09.085 --> 27:12.130
(background chatter)

27:12.213 --> 27:13.590
(all laugh)

27:13.673 --> 27:17.510
(serene music)

27:25.268 --> 27:27.687
Hey, Jake! How's it going?

27:28.229 --> 27:29.689
Oh, cool, you brought your ukulele.

27:29.773 --> 27:32.192
You know, 'cause there's a lot of people
would love to hear you play.

27:32.275 --> 27:33.735
Her name is Linda.

27:33.818 --> 27:35.904
-And you're damn right I brought her.
-BENNY: Right on.

27:40.533 --> 27:45.288
(calm music playing on ukulele)

28:13.400 --> 28:15.276
(all cheer)

28:26.162 --> 28:27.247
A really good poi.

28:27.330 --> 28:28.331
BENNY: Good?

28:32.544 --> 28:35.839
(all laughing, chattering)

28:40.552 --> 28:43.596
(calm music continues)

28:50.270 --> 28:52.856
(all laugh)

29:00.613 --> 29:02.824
CLARA: They're really good, you know.

29:04.868 --> 29:08.163
Are you gonna get in trouble
for discharging Uncle John?

29:09.789 --> 29:11.040
Probably.
(sighs)

29:15.378 --> 29:17.464
Gonna cost you Chief of Staff?

29:19.132 --> 29:20.675
Probably.

29:24.095 --> 29:25.972
But it was worth it.

29:26.514 --> 29:27.432
For this.

29:29.350 --> 29:30.769
(Clara giggles)

29:35.565 --> 29:38.902
(calm music continues)

29:44.115 --> 29:46.534
-DR. LEE: I know, we got a good time.
-(both laugh)

29:46.618 --> 29:48.203
I hit that ball...

29:48.286 --> 29:51.122
Okay, no, be honest. Have you been
watching mid-'90s Tiger Woods?

29:51.206 --> 29:53.249
-Yes.
-Because I recognize that form.

29:53.666 --> 29:56.795
Dr. Hannon, there's a rumor going around
that you discharged a patient

29:56.878 --> 30:00.006
to attend a family event
against hospital protocol.

30:00.965 --> 30:03.885
Yikes, I never pick you
for a rule-breaker, Clara.

30:03.968 --> 30:06.137
I mean, I've watched you repark
your car like five times,

30:06.221 --> 30:07.931
so you're exactly inside the lines.

30:08.014 --> 30:10.433
Hmm. I realize it was unorthodox,

30:10.517 --> 30:14.145
but the patient had already made
a quantitative step toward recovery.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.397
I assume you're aware
of the reason we have strict policies

30:16.481 --> 30:19.317
is to protect the hospital from lawsuits.

30:19.400 --> 30:24.072
However, those rules were made
by lawyers and not doctors.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.992
My father languished
for months in hospice.

30:28.910 --> 30:31.329
And I only wish he had a doctor like you.

30:31.913 --> 30:36.084
Driven, dedicated, compassionate.

30:37.126 --> 30:39.170
Please join me in congratulating...

30:41.005 --> 30:43.424
your new Chief of Staff...

30:43.508 --> 30:44.425
(crowd chatter)

30:45.635 --> 30:46.886
...Dr. Hannon.

30:46.970 --> 30:49.472
(applause)

30:49.556 --> 30:50.515
Thank you.

30:51.641 --> 30:52.809
(Clara chuckles)

30:59.190 --> 31:00.692
(sighs)
Oh.

31:01.484 --> 31:05.196
-CHARLES: Come here! Oh, my god.
-NOELANI: Oh, my god.

31:08.491 --> 31:09.659
(Dr. Lee clears throat)

31:10.869 --> 31:13.079
Congrats, Dr. Hannon.

31:13.162 --> 31:14.414
You're gonna be awesome.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.834
Is it too early to put in
for a closer parking space?

31:17.917 --> 31:19.544
-Yeah, it's too early.
-Okay, I'll talk to you about it later.

31:19.627 --> 31:21.379
-Okay.
-BENNY: Congratulations, babe.

31:21.462 --> 31:22.839
-(laughs)
-Oh.

31:22.922 --> 31:24.716
-How did you know?
-(Benny cackles)

31:25.383 --> 31:27.719
Mr. Hsiao was pretty awkward
at the shave ice truck earlier.

31:28.303 --> 31:29.345
So, I made you a bouquet.

31:29.429 --> 31:31.723
Knowing it was either good news
or bad news.

31:31.806 --> 31:33.182
I love you.
(chuckles)

31:33.850 --> 31:35.810
Mom!
(screams)

31:35.894 --> 31:38.771
Congratulations, Chief of Staff!

31:38.855 --> 31:39.689
Thanks, sweetie.

31:39.772 --> 31:40.940
You did it.

31:41.024 --> 31:42.025
We did it.

31:42.108 --> 31:43.818
-(chuckles)
-Oh.

31:43.902 --> 31:47.739
(all cheering)

31:51.075 --> 31:53.494
This is crazy.
(laughs)

32:00.376 --> 32:02.712
(calm music)

32:05.632 --> 32:08.384
(waves crashing)

32:12.847 --> 32:13.681
Hey.

32:14.933 --> 32:17.769
Lahela, howzit? I had fun
at your family's thing last night.

32:17.852 --> 32:22.106
Oh, sorry we ate so late.
My dad forgot to put the pig in the imu.

32:22.190 --> 32:25.318
No worries. Brian Patrick was dealing
pizza slices behind the barn.

32:25.401 --> 32:26.653
(chuckles)

32:27.779 --> 32:31.074
Thank you for reminding me
how much I love being a doctor.

32:32.533 --> 32:34.035
It's your passion.

32:35.787 --> 32:36.663
Yeah.

32:38.081 --> 32:40.083
Your passion is surfing.

32:41.250 --> 32:44.545
You have the chance
to be the youngest surfer on tour.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.756
Don't give up on that.

32:48.508 --> 32:49.759
What are you saying?

32:53.262 --> 32:55.515
You need to go to Australia.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.434
No matter how much I want you to stay.

33:00.061 --> 33:01.604
You can't give up on your passion.

33:04.440 --> 33:07.986
Are you sure this is really what you want?

33:12.573 --> 33:13.533
Yeah.

33:21.124 --> 33:23.876
(calm music continues)

33:30.466 --> 33:32.593
(exhales, sniffles)

33:33.428 --> 33:34.929
Now, go get a sesh in.

33:36.848 --> 33:39.475
You better win this thing.
I'm not dating a loser.
