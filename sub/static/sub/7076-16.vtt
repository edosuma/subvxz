WEBVTT

00:04.543 --> 00:05.810
We are so screwed.

00:05.811 --> 00:06.978
How are we gonna
memorize all this?

00:06.979 --> 00:08.212
Let's just go over it again.

00:08.213 --> 00:10.280
Kingdom, phylum, class...

00:10.281 --> 00:13.751
Order, family, genus, species.

00:13.752 --> 00:15.853
I use a mnemonic device.

00:15.854 --> 00:19.690
"Kevin, please come
over for gay sex."

00:19.691 --> 00:22.192
Why wouldn't you use "Karen"?

00:22.193 --> 00:23.761
'Cause it's gay sex, dummy.

00:23.762 --> 00:25.328
So use "great".

00:25.329 --> 00:27.296
Now I can't remember anything.
Thanks!

00:27.297 --> 00:29.265
God, why do we always wind up
in this position?

00:29.266 --> 00:30.900
For all the time you spend here,
you'd think we wouldn't

00:30.901 --> 00:32.201
have to cram so much.

00:32.202 --> 00:33.602
Maybe we never get any work
done because we have

00:33.603 --> 00:35.085
so much fun hanging out
together.

00:35.086 --> 00:38.022
Definitely, maybe that's why.

00:38.877 --> 00:44.212
Ah, the duali-Dean of man.

00:44.213 --> 00:46.848
I'm dressed this way because I
have good news and bad news.

00:46.849 --> 00:48.850
You have got to be kidding me.

00:48.851 --> 00:51.820
The bad news is Professor Kane
has the flu.

00:51.821 --> 00:54.322
The good news is biology class
is canceled...

00:56.192 --> 00:57.258
After you.

00:57.259 --> 01:00.027
What a gentleman.

01:00.028 --> 01:02.697
Guys, we don't have to cram
last minute anymore.

01:02.698 --> 01:04.732
Last minute got
moved to tomorrow.

01:04.733 --> 01:06.734
Three-hour lunch? Three-hour
lunch? Three-hour lunch?

01:06.735 --> 01:07.968
Three hours?

01:07.969 --> 01:09.704
I could watch the first half of
three movies.

01:09.705 --> 01:11.038
Ooh, I don't have to go
to the fast food

01:11.039 --> 01:12.173
restaurant across the street.

01:12.174 --> 01:13.574
I can go to the fancy one
across town.

01:13.575 --> 01:14.808
Their manager wears a tie.

01:14.809 --> 01:16.242
If we don't eat, we can
make-believe

01:16.243 --> 01:17.711
an whole episode's worth of
Inspector Spacetime

01:17.712 --> 01:19.112
- in the Dreamatorium.
- Word.

01:19.113 --> 01:20.947
Yeah.

01:20.948 --> 01:23.016
Maybe we should go
to Señor Kevin's.

01:23.017 --> 01:25.018
Britta, didn't you want to try
that new cage-free bean burrito?

01:25.019 --> 01:27.420
The tortillas are made with
micro-financed flour.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.955
Troy, you could drive.

01:28.956 --> 01:30.856
You always like that spiral
parking ramp.

01:30.857 --> 01:32.925
You just keep turning left,
but you end up up!

01:32.926 --> 01:35.060
I can't go to Señor Kevin's.
The manager and I are enemies.

01:35.061 --> 01:36.394
<i>He said Die Hard was bad.</i>

01:36.395 --> 01:37.763
<i>- He said Die Hard was bad.
- I know, buddy.</i>

01:37.764 --> 01:39.297
Well, how about this.

01:39.298 --> 01:42.567
This lunch is already a runaway
train, no point in stopping it.

01:42.568 --> 01:44.837
Troy, Britta, you go
to Señor Kevin's.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.704
Abed promised he'd show me how
the Dreamatorium works.

01:46.705 --> 01:48.606
- Today's the perfect day for it.
- But I want to...

01:48.607 --> 01:50.208
Abed, don't you think today's

01:50.209 --> 01:51.743
- the perfect day for it?
- No.

01:51.744 --> 01:54.212
- Abed.
- Is this a social cue?

01:54.213 --> 01:58.420
<i>I left my Puttin' On the Ritz
cane in here earlier.</i>

01:59.384 --> 02:01.018
I know it probably
has another name,

02:01.019 --> 02:04.287
but, um, can I be perfectly
honest with you guys?

02:04.288 --> 02:06.189
I think I went too
far with this one.

02:06.190 --> 02:10.460
I have to go to the bank today.

02:10.461 --> 02:12.162
What am I supposed to tell
people in line?

02:12.163 --> 02:14.998
"I had good news and bad news"?

02:14.999 --> 02:16.967
Come on, Craig.

02:16.968 --> 02:19.235
Get you life together.

02:23.839 --> 02:27.409

02:27.410 --> 02:30.846

Sync & Corrections by Elderfel
www.addic7ed.com

02:51.833 --> 02:54.067
I am Inspector Spacetime.

02:54.068 --> 02:56.136
And I know that
which is unknown.

02:56.137 --> 03:00.040
Duty-bound to protect a universe
of innocent unremarkables,

03:00.041 --> 03:02.575
I patrol it
in the x7 Dimensionizer

03:02.576 --> 03:05.045
with my loyal constable,
Reggie.

03:05.046 --> 03:08.147
This week, however, Reggie has
been forced to go to lunch.

03:08.148 --> 03:11.450
<i>So I'm aboard the much crappier
H.M.S. Spacetime 12,</i>

03:11.451 --> 03:15.855
from the worst season ever, with
temporary constable, Geneva.

03:15.856 --> 03:18.958
Geneva, I need the quantum
spanner, the big one.

03:18.959 --> 03:22.894
Oi, gov'ner, quantum spammer,
up an' at 'em, in'it?

03:25.431 --> 03:26.731
If we can't get out
of orbital lock,

03:26.732 --> 03:28.366
the Blorgons may intercept.

03:28.367 --> 03:29.835
Tut tut, m'lord.

03:29.836 --> 03:33.738
Wouldn't give a tuppence for
that sticky wicket.

03:33.739 --> 03:35.573
Okay, stop simulation.

03:35.574 --> 03:36.741
More British?

03:36.742 --> 03:38.508
I can't do this anymore.

03:38.509 --> 03:40.677
But the Blo-gons might
intercept...

03:40.678 --> 03:42.112
It's Blorgons with an "r".

03:42.113 --> 03:43.513
Blo-gon means "thank you"
in blorgon.

03:43.514 --> 03:45.382
Can't we play something
I know about

03:45.383 --> 03:48.026
like hospital administration?

03:49.821 --> 03:53.457
You're mad at me for playing
matchmaker with Troy and Britta.

03:53.458 --> 03:55.058
You think you're
gonna lose Troy.

03:55.059 --> 03:56.092
I'm not petty, Annie.

03:56.093 --> 03:57.093
I'm mad at you because you
tampered

03:57.094 --> 03:58.394
with the fabric of the group.

03:58.395 --> 03:59.562
How do you know
Troy and Britta pairing up

03:59.563 --> 04:00.663
wouldn't destroy everything?

04:00.664 --> 04:01.965
I run the scenarios.

04:01.966 --> 04:03.199
I examine this stuff
from every conceivable angle.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.434
Oh, and you can do
that but I can't?

04:05.435 --> 04:07.871
You don't have a patent on being
a control freak, Abed.

04:07.872 --> 04:08.905
I kind of do.

04:08.906 --> 04:11.006
You think this is just a room
where Troy and I play dinosaurs

04:11.007 --> 04:12.374
versus river boat gamblers
together?

04:12.375 --> 04:13.976
Sure, it's how I got
the construction approved,

04:13.977 --> 04:15.310
but, much like myself,

04:15.311 --> 04:17.411
the Dreamatorium
has higher functions.

04:17.413 --> 04:19.409
Would you like me to show you
how your stunt

04:19.410 --> 04:20.349
with Troy and Britta
will play itself out?

04:20.350 --> 04:21.983
Why not?

04:21.985 --> 04:23.852
Execute simulation Troy/Britta.

04:23.853 --> 04:27.621
Render environment
Señor Kevin's.

04:27.622 --> 04:29.123
Oh, those appetizers

04:29.124 --> 04:31.993
were dope and legit!

04:31.994 --> 04:33.327
I don't usually support lunch

04:33.328 --> 04:36.097
because it's unfair
to breakfast.

04:36.098 --> 04:37.098
I never thought about

04:37.099 --> 04:40.167
meals fighting each other.

04:40.168 --> 04:41.602
I guess that explains
why you never

04:41.603 --> 04:43.870
see any two of them on
the same table.

04:43.871 --> 04:45.906
So I guess Annie's pretty hot
to get us together.

04:45.907 --> 04:48.875
She probably just doesn't
understand people.

04:48.876 --> 04:50.310
Well, the sooner
the food comes,

04:50.311 --> 04:52.478
the sooner this will be over.

04:52.479 --> 04:56.149
I'm afraid your food won't be
ready for another half hour.

04:56.150 --> 04:59.818
<i>I'm too busy misunderstanding
the whole point of Die Hard.</i>

04:59.819 --> 05:02.854
I can't wait to
get home to Abed.

05:02.855 --> 05:05.057
So you can dart back and forth

05:05.058 --> 05:06.558
doing impressions
of your friends.

05:06.559 --> 05:08.427
There's no science at work here.

05:08.428 --> 05:11.763
You're right.

05:11.764 --> 05:14.698
The science is at work in here.

05:16.501 --> 05:19.703
This is
the Dreamatorium's engine.

05:19.704 --> 05:21.105
My thoughts are collected
by this box

05:21.106 --> 05:23.408
and everything I know about my
friends is stored here.

05:23.409 --> 05:24.775
Both are distilled
by logic and then

05:24.776 --> 05:26.577
recombined into objective
observation.

05:26.578 --> 05:28.246
I'm able to simulate
any of the study group

05:28.247 --> 05:31.448
and even a half-accurate Chang
in over 7,000 unique situations.

05:31.449 --> 05:35.018
Abed, it's cardboard tubes
and a funnel.

05:35.019 --> 05:36.286
Well you see it that way
because it's calibrated

05:36.287 --> 05:37.854
to a specific level
of brain function.

05:37.855 --> 05:40.057
Right. I'm stupid.

05:40.058 --> 05:42.359
Not stupid, just less able to
see what I see.

05:42.360 --> 05:45.429
Gee, you've got it
all figured out.

05:47.764 --> 05:50.532
King of toilet paper rolls
over here.

05:50.533 --> 05:54.303
Hey, Troy, I'm glad you called.

05:54.304 --> 05:55.438
Your lunch is going well, right?

05:55.439 --> 05:57.173
Yeah, just checking on Abed.

05:57.174 --> 05:59.075
Making sure he's okay.

05:59.076 --> 06:01.510
What? He's fine.

06:01.511 --> 06:03.411
He just implied I operate
on a lower level

06:03.412 --> 06:06.147
of brain function,
so business as usual.

06:06.148 --> 06:09.650
Great, um, just, you know,
make sure he stays comfortable.

06:09.651 --> 06:11.252
I worry about him
when I'm not around.

06:11.253 --> 06:15.390
Well, he's fine,
he always will be.

06:15.391 --> 06:17.359
People bend over backwards to
cater to him.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.060
He's just extra sensitive in
the Dreamatorium.

06:20.061 --> 06:22.129
It takes a lot out of
him to run that thing.

06:22.130 --> 06:23.630
I don't want you to
break his brain.

06:23.631 --> 06:24.931
Bye, Troy.

06:24.932 --> 06:28.002
- How is he?
- He'll be okay.

06:28.003 --> 06:29.636
It's so sweet how much you
care about him.

06:29.637 --> 06:32.806
<i>And another thing
I hate about Die Hard,</i>

06:32.807 --> 06:35.741
two FBI agents named Johnson.

06:37.511 --> 06:40.146
I've been thinking about our
Inspector Spacetime scenario.

06:40.147 --> 06:42.248
It might work better if instead
of playing Geneva,

06:42.249 --> 06:43.483
you played Rosamund.

06:43.484 --> 06:44.817
She was a constable
in season five

06:44.818 --> 06:46.986
and she only had three lines.

06:46.987 --> 06:48.587
I have a better idea.

06:48.588 --> 06:50.955
You know what would make your
scenarios a lot more realistic?

06:50.956 --> 06:52.124
If Troy weren't on a date.

06:52.125 --> 06:53.425
Why don't you take
all your thoughts

06:53.426 --> 06:56.761
and your logic and add one step
to the process.

06:56.762 --> 06:58.296
- What are you doing?
- From now on,

06:58.297 --> 07:00.198
before you do or say anything,

07:00.199 --> 07:03.101
you're gonna think about how it
affects the people around you.

07:03.102 --> 07:05.637
We lower functioning brains call
this "empathy".

07:09.174 --> 07:12.576
Abed?

07:12.577 --> 07:16.180
Abed?

07:16.181 --> 07:18.049
Oh, my God, I broke Abed.

07:21.258 --> 07:23.258
Abed?

07:23.259 --> 07:24.259
You know how you wanted me to
tell you

07:24.260 --> 07:26.894
when you were being scary weird
instead of cute weird?

07:26.895 --> 07:29.831
This is scary weird.

07:31.934 --> 07:34.635
Hello, Annie.

07:34.636 --> 07:36.838
What was I doing on the floor?

07:36.839 --> 07:39.173
Were we... doing it?

07:39.174 --> 07:41.408
Are you being Jeff?

07:41.409 --> 07:44.677
Well, I'm not
being a Kardashian.

07:44.678 --> 07:45.846
So where are we now?

07:45.847 --> 07:49.049
We're in the doctor's lounge
of Greendale Hospital School.

07:49.050 --> 07:50.117
Hospital school?

07:50.118 --> 07:51.752
It's a sexy emotional school

07:51.753 --> 07:53.553
where doctors save
lives and make love,

07:53.554 --> 07:54.788
often simultaneously.

07:54.789 --> 07:57.190
Our stories,
ripped from the headlines.

07:57.191 --> 07:59.024
Our passions, unbridled.

07:59.025 --> 08:02.094
Our cafeteria, eh...

08:02.095 --> 08:03.462
Make love to me, Ann.

08:03.463 --> 08:04.730
I know I'm just a surgeon

08:04.731 --> 08:06.598
and you're a hotshot
upstart administrator,

08:06.599 --> 08:08.167
but damn the rules,
damn the system,

08:08.168 --> 08:10.870
damn our two foot height
disparity, I want you.

08:10.871 --> 08:14.306
Okay, Abed, I get it, we have
different sensibilities.

08:14.307 --> 08:16.241
Later.

08:19.111 --> 08:20.678
Bye.

08:20.679 --> 08:22.613
I'm leaving.

08:24.000 --> 08:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:31.555 --> 08:34.357
Okay, Dr. Jeff,

08:34.357 --> 08:36.894
can you please tell me
where I can find Abed?

08:36.895 --> 08:37.995
I owe him an apology.

08:37.996 --> 08:40.429
Abed? Never heard of him.

08:40.431 --> 08:44.567
Terrific.

08:44.568 --> 08:46.903
I asked you a question, doctor.

08:46.904 --> 08:47.870
I'm a surgeon!

08:47.871 --> 08:49.471
And I'm your administrator!

08:49.472 --> 08:51.373
I left my wife for you
and she was pregnant!

08:51.374 --> 08:53.609
Who do you think
inseminated her?

08:53.610 --> 08:56.112
Now tell me what I want to know
or God as my witness,

08:56.113 --> 08:57.446
I'll have your stethoscope.

08:57.447 --> 08:58.981
Fine.

08:58.982 --> 09:01.517
Dr. Perry might know.

09:01.518 --> 09:04.452
Render environment bio lab.

09:06.155 --> 09:08.990
Look, there's Britta and Troy
fooling around with each other.

09:08.991 --> 09:12.093
Look, there's Abed having
overcome his issues.

09:12.094 --> 09:13.461
Nice try.

09:13.462 --> 09:16.764
Dr. Barnes, Dr. Perry.

09:16.765 --> 09:19.834
We just saved an uninsured
homeless man's life.

09:19.835 --> 09:22.203
Using an unapproved procedure.

09:22.204 --> 09:25.139
Now, we're going to kiss.

09:30.912 --> 09:32.479
This is what you think I want?

09:32.480 --> 09:35.014
What do you want,
administrator?

09:35.015 --> 09:36.582
I want to talk to Abed.

09:36.583 --> 09:38.017
There's no one here
by that name.

09:38.018 --> 09:40.220
- You're lying.
- Maybe I am, so what?

09:40.221 --> 09:42.255
I was raised on
the mean streets of Harlem.

09:42.256 --> 09:43.456
I'm not scared of you.

09:43.457 --> 09:46.392
Well, be scared of this.

09:48.863 --> 09:52.797
Sodium pentothal, known commonly
as truth serum.

09:54.433 --> 09:58.303
I saw Abed's name
in the hospital school files,

09:58.304 --> 10:00.538
I love butt stuff,
I hate spiders,

10:00.539 --> 10:02.607
I stole a pen from the bank,

10:02.608 --> 10:05.310
<i>I cried during About a Boy...
The soundtrack...</i>

10:05.311 --> 10:07.879
I don't wash my hands
before surgery.

10:07.880 --> 10:10.381
I can see why women find
Clive Owen attractive to the point

10:10.382 --> 10:12.483
where I might just as well be
attracted to him.

10:12.484 --> 10:15.286
I use comparisons to Hitler to
win arguments on the Internet

10:15.287 --> 10:16.587
at the drop of a hat.

10:16.588 --> 10:18.356
I know nothing about wine.

10:18.357 --> 10:20.824
I'm more turned on by women
in pajamas than lingerie.

10:20.825 --> 10:22.693
I just want to know
they feel comfortable.

10:22.694 --> 10:26.429
<i>I didn't get Inception.</i>

10:26.430 --> 10:30.133
<i>I didn't
get Inception.</i>

10:32.236 --> 10:33.803
You said you saw
his name in the files.

10:33.804 --> 10:35.638
There's so many layers.

10:35.639 --> 10:39.574
Right, render environment
medical study room.

10:39.575 --> 10:40.876
There's head nurse, Shirley,

10:40.877 --> 10:42.912
talking to tragic,
heart-wrenching Alzheimer's

10:42.913 --> 10:45.347
patient and Emmy-contender,
Pierce Hawthorne.

10:45.348 --> 10:49.351
Mr. Hawthorne,
you're out of your bed again.

10:49.352 --> 10:50.819
'Cause I think I'm on a train.

10:50.820 --> 10:52.554
Oh! Oh!

10:52.555 --> 10:54.790
Shirley, get me
the file on Abed.

10:54.791 --> 10:56.490
Abed doesn't exist, young lady.

10:56.491 --> 10:57.926
He exists if I say so.

10:57.927 --> 10:59.260
This is my hospital school.

10:59.261 --> 11:01.262
Your hospital school,
young lady, is a simulation

11:01.263 --> 11:03.264
being run through a filter of
other people's needs.

11:03.265 --> 11:07.101
Abed's been filtered out
because nobody needs him.

11:07.102 --> 11:08.102
I need him.

11:08.103 --> 11:09.237
Well you're not simulated.

11:09.238 --> 11:10.538
No, but this is!

11:11.605 --> 11:13.006
Ooh!

11:13.007 --> 11:14.408
And there's more where that
didn't come from.

11:14.409 --> 11:16.209
This is a private compartment.

11:16.210 --> 11:18.378
- Jeff, get the files.
- Why me?

11:18.379 --> 11:21.214
Because you can see
the cabinets.

11:21.215 --> 11:22.416
And I'll make love to you.

11:22.417 --> 11:24.451
Jackpot.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.888
There is an Abed in this
hospital school,

11:29.889 --> 11:33.125
but he's not a doctor.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.693
He's a patient.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.795
- Notify security!
- Conductor!

11:36.796 --> 11:38.130
Jeff, take me to Abed.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.365
Where is that?

11:39.366 --> 11:42.134
Enough games, just take me
where I wanna go.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.724
Follow me.

11:45.097 --> 11:45.971
Are we close?

11:45.972 --> 11:48.373
Almost there, although you
should probably run in place

11:48.374 --> 11:51.309
and let the hall
move around you.

11:56.548 --> 11:58.916
- Here we are.
- Where?

11:58.917 --> 12:00.717
Where you wanted to go.

12:00.718 --> 12:03.854
The last night of school,
first year.

12:03.855 --> 12:05.689
The night we kissed.

12:05.690 --> 12:09.159
Ababed wasn't there,
so whose memory is this?

12:09.160 --> 12:10.461
Maybe it's yours.

12:10.462 --> 12:12.863
Maybe the Dreamatorium
really works.

12:12.864 --> 12:14.998
Or maybe Leonard was watching
from the bushes

12:14.999 --> 12:16.732
and told Abed about it.

12:16.733 --> 12:19.202
I don't have cable.

12:19.203 --> 12:20.936
Knock it off, Abed.

12:20.937 --> 12:22.005
I'm not Abed.

12:22.006 --> 12:24.640
You're confused,
so was I.

12:24.641 --> 12:26.142
But not anymore.

12:26.143 --> 12:28.777
Jeff...
Abed, stop!

12:28.778 --> 12:29.979
I don't wanna do this.

12:29.980 --> 12:33.148
I want to talk to Abed.

12:33.149 --> 12:37.185
I'm taking the file.

12:37.186 --> 12:40.822
Oh, it says Abed
is in the recovery parlor.

12:40.823 --> 12:43.492
Condition... never better.

12:43.493 --> 12:46.728
You're not holding anything.

12:46.729 --> 12:49.696
This is the file.

12:49.697 --> 12:53.234
Abed Nadir,
psychiatric patient 1373,

12:53.235 --> 12:55.336
control freak with no empathy.

12:55.337 --> 12:58.972
People bend over backwards
to cater to him.

12:58.973 --> 13:03.443
Signed, healthcare administrator
Annie Edison.

13:03.444 --> 13:05.678
That's out of context.

13:05.679 --> 13:06.846
Shh.

13:06.847 --> 13:08.848
You've thought
of everything, Annie.

13:08.849 --> 13:11.484
With Abed gone
and Troy and Britta together,

13:11.485 --> 13:13.386
there's nothing standing
in the way of us.

13:13.387 --> 13:14.587
Wait, what?

13:14.588 --> 13:15.855
Come on.

13:15.856 --> 13:16.923
This is you dream.

13:16.924 --> 13:19.858
This is why you
played matchmaker.

13:19.859 --> 13:22.494
This is what's important to you.

13:22.495 --> 13:24.963
You are not Jeff.

13:24.964 --> 13:27.966
Because Jeff cares about Abed.

13:27.967 --> 13:29.601
And I did not push
Troy and Britta together

13:29.602 --> 13:30.869
so this would happen.

13:30.870 --> 13:32.538
I did it because I thought
they were cute together

13:32.539 --> 13:34.540
and this would
have been a bonus.

13:34.541 --> 13:36.441
And we are not here.

13:36.442 --> 13:39.843
And I'm not staying here because
I hate whoever you are.

13:39.844 --> 13:41.845
You should probably
storm off in...

13:41.846 --> 13:43.247
Oh!

13:43.248 --> 13:45.183
In place.

13:54.243 --> 13:55.410
Where do you wanna go next?

13:55.411 --> 13:57.712
I wanna be alone.

13:57.713 --> 13:59.547
Sounds good to me.

13:59.548 --> 14:02.483
Execute simulation,
Annie/Annie.

14:04.954 --> 14:06.854
There.

14:06.855 --> 14:08.222
Now we're alone.

14:08.223 --> 14:10.825
Great, so you're me now.

14:10.826 --> 14:13.227
Why are you blowing
our magic moment with Jeff?

14:13.228 --> 14:14.361
It's not magic.

14:14.362 --> 14:15.495
It's not even real.

14:15.496 --> 14:17.998
But we love Jeff.

14:17.999 --> 14:20.734
No, we don't.

14:20.735 --> 14:23.903
We're just in love
with the idea of being loved.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.872
And if we can teach a guy
like Jeff to do it,

14:25.873 --> 14:27.874
we'll never be unloved.

14:27.875 --> 14:30.576
So we keep running the same
scenario over and over

14:30.577 --> 14:32.078
hoping for a different result.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.779
Running scenarios.

14:33.780 --> 14:35.048
Careful now.

14:35.049 --> 14:38.317
You're starting
to sound like Abed.

14:38.318 --> 14:42.087
<i>So... I probably shouldn't say
things like "Star Wars.</i>

14:42.088 --> 14:44.589
<i>Zardoz, Cougar Town,
cool, cool, cool."</i>

14:44.590 --> 14:46.225
- Stop it.
- Pop culture, pop culture.

14:46.226 --> 14:49.228
- I'm on a TV show.
- You're gonna get in trouble.

14:49.229 --> 14:50.996
Meta, meta.

14:50.997 --> 14:52.197
It's Abed!

14:52.198 --> 14:53.765
I got an Abed here!

14:53.766 --> 14:54.999
Get him!

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
That's it.

14:56.001 --> 14:57.601
I find you guilty of being Abed.

14:57.602 --> 14:59.036
You're under arrest!

14:59.037 --> 15:00.304
Can I just interject and say

15:00.305 --> 15:03.241
I don't know what
the hell's going on?

15:09.314 --> 15:12.082
This time you'll never get out.

15:12.083 --> 15:14.017
Abed?

15:16.754 --> 15:17.754
Abed.

15:17.755 --> 15:18.989
Yeah.

15:18.990 --> 15:20.623
I found you by turning into you,
how cool is that?

15:20.624 --> 15:22.225
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.

15:22.226 --> 15:23.826
Tell me where we are
so I can pretend to see it.

15:23.827 --> 15:25.495
We're inside a locker.

15:25.496 --> 15:28.430
It's where I spent a lot of time
in junior high.

15:28.431 --> 15:29.965
You think this is
where we'd put you?

15:29.966 --> 15:32.734
- You know that's absurd, right?
- Well, I'm not stupid.

15:32.735 --> 15:34.904
You can see I've increased
the square footage.

15:34.905 --> 15:36.571
It's a metaphorical locker.

15:36.572 --> 15:37.839
It's a place where
people like me get put

15:37.840 --> 15:39.174
when everyone's finally
fed up with us.

15:39.175 --> 15:42.310
Abed, so maudlin.

15:42.311 --> 15:44.312
If you start turning
into a vampire...

15:44.313 --> 15:45.479
I've run the simulations,
Annie.

15:45.480 --> 15:46.814
I don't get married,
I don't invent

15:46.815 --> 15:48.316
a billion dollar website
that helps people have sex.

15:48.317 --> 15:50.551
I don't make in into Sundance,
Slamdance or Dance Pants.

15:50.552 --> 15:52.486
Troy invents Dance Pants
in 2019.

15:52.487 --> 15:53.988
Don't tell him, he needs to
stumble onto it.

15:53.989 --> 15:55.189
All right, listen.

15:55.190 --> 15:56.757
The scenarios you run in here

15:56.758 --> 16:00.160
are like...
great science fiction.

16:00.161 --> 16:03.797
They're impressive and detailed
and insightful,

16:03.798 --> 16:05.966
but they're not
accurate for crap.

16:05.967 --> 16:07.767
Science fiction never has been.

16:07.768 --> 16:09.269
<i>Look at 2001.</i>

16:09.270 --> 16:11.071
Did we have a space odyssey?

16:11.072 --> 16:13.407
No, we got snowboarding
in the Olympics

16:13.408 --> 16:15.041
and we over-validated
Carson Daily.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.410
- That poor guy.
- Yeah, cry me a river.

16:17.411 --> 16:18.978
My point is, your simulations

16:18.979 --> 16:20.879
are nothing more
than anxieties.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.348
You're afraid you don't fit in.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.950
You're afraid you'll be alone.

16:23.951 --> 16:26.819
Great news... you share
that with all of us,

16:26.820 --> 16:30.355
so you'll never be alone
and you'll always fit in.

16:30.356 --> 16:33.425
And, yes, that's why I meddled
with Troy and Britta.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.426
You caught me.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.860
I was trying to make life go

16:35.861 --> 16:37.228
according to some script.

16:37.229 --> 16:38.763
I can't.

16:38.764 --> 16:40.765
You can't.

16:40.766 --> 16:44.035
We both need to get more
comfortable winging it.

16:44.036 --> 16:45.503
At least it'll be less work.

16:45.504 --> 16:46.937
It would cut down my
Dreamatorium time

16:46.938 --> 16:48.339
by 18 hours a week.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.340
I could take up yoga.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.241
You've got the body type.

16:51.242 --> 16:53.077
Now let's get you out of here.

16:53.078 --> 16:54.311
I don't know how.

16:54.312 --> 16:56.046
These fake shackles
don't have a fake key.

16:56.047 --> 16:59.049
Isn't that what a...
quantum spanner's for?

16:59.050 --> 17:01.585
Technically, no.

17:01.586 --> 17:04.686
But that's fine.

17:09.326 --> 17:11.426
So should we get back to lunch?

17:11.428 --> 17:12.428
I guess so.

17:12.429 --> 17:13.429
A little more anticlimactic

17:13.430 --> 17:14.430
than I would have simulated it,

17:14.431 --> 17:17.233
- but whatever.
- Anticlimactic?

17:17.233 --> 17:19.201
Render environment
observo-deck,

17:19.202 --> 17:23.704
<i>H.M.S. Spacetime 12.</i>

17:23.705 --> 17:26.941
Inspector, set the tachyon drive
to hyperjump.

17:26.942 --> 17:28.943
We must get to the other side of
this star field

17:28.944 --> 17:31.679
before the Blorgons intercept.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.948
Blorgons in this sector?

17:33.949 --> 17:36.550
Well, this mission has gone
pear-shaped, indeed.

17:36.551 --> 17:38.719
Prepare to hyperjump
on my mark.

17:38.720 --> 17:41.088
Bugger the dovecoats,
inspector.

17:41.089 --> 17:42.890
We're too late! Blorgons!

17:42.891 --> 17:45.459
Eradicate! Eradicate!

17:45.460 --> 17:49.063
Our quantum blasters are
useless against their armor.

17:49.064 --> 17:51.431
We're as cooked as Lord Nelson's
mutton, we are.

17:51.432 --> 17:52.965
Not if I can help it.

17:52.966 --> 17:57.437
I'll see you on the other side
inspector... Wherever that is.

17:57.438 --> 18:00.806
Don't you mean
"whenever that is"?

18:04.145 --> 18:06.211
Take that, Blorgon scum!

18:06.212 --> 18:09.348
You'll blo-gon me
for this later.

18:09.349 --> 18:10.949
Ow, Annie!

18:10.950 --> 18:12.351
Oh, oh, my God!

18:12.352 --> 18:14.453
Abed, I'm so sorry.

18:14.454 --> 18:15.854
No, no, you're committing.

18:15.855 --> 18:17.022
This is good stuff.

18:17.023 --> 18:19.624
Thanks.

18:19.625 --> 18:21.760
I am Abed Nadir...

18:21.761 --> 18:23.928
And I don't know a lot of things
everyone else knows.

18:23.929 --> 18:25.963
I wander the universe
with my friend, Troy,

18:25.964 --> 18:27.465
doing whatever I want.

18:27.466 --> 18:30.868
Sometimes accidentally hurting
innocent unremarkables.

18:30.869 --> 18:34.305
This week, however, Troy went
to lunch and I adapted.

18:34.306 --> 18:37.375
I now have the ability
to enter the minds of others.

18:37.376 --> 18:39.576
- I'm hungry, are you hungry?
- Yeah.

18:39.577 --> 18:41.144
I'll make us buttered noodles.

18:41.145 --> 18:44.581
Using an elusive new
technique known as "empathy".

18:46.617 --> 18:48.718
So was the other fast food
place worth the drive, Shirley?

18:48.719 --> 18:50.620
You know, half way there I
thought, "What am I doing?

18:50.621 --> 18:52.655
It's the same fast food place
in a different location.

18:52.656 --> 18:55.124
Have the margins of my life
become so narrow?"

18:55.125 --> 18:56.825
So I went to the mall
and had pizza.

18:58.661 --> 19:01.530
Sounds like this has been a
game-changing day for all of us.

19:01.531 --> 19:03.299
I almost sat on my balls,

19:03.300 --> 19:06.802
but at the last second,
I made an adjustment.

19:06.803 --> 19:08.704
- Good job!
- Good work.

19:08.705 --> 19:10.138
Good job, man.

19:10.139 --> 19:11.372
Well, we had a good lunch, too.

19:11.373 --> 19:13.674
Yeah.

19:13.675 --> 19:15.243
<i>I spoke to the manager
about Die Hard,</i>

19:15.244 --> 19:16.811
and I told him he should be
ashamed of himself.

19:16.812 --> 19:18.179
Thanks.

19:18.180 --> 19:20.315
Sorry I bailed
on the Dreamatorium.

19:20.316 --> 19:24.319
It's okay, Annie did pretty
good in a pinch.

19:24.320 --> 19:27.787
All right, back to cramming?

19:27.788 --> 19:31.024
The people at the bank loved
my outfit.

19:31.025 --> 19:33.393
And they had all kinds of
questions about it

19:33.394 --> 19:34.894
and my answers seemed to amuse

19:34.895 --> 19:37.531
and... and even liberate
them a little.

19:37.532 --> 19:39.099
A few of us went to lunch

19:39.100 --> 19:43.068
and I had the deepest
conversation of my life.

19:43.069 --> 19:47.039
I gotta go,
I'm telling everybody.

19:47.040 --> 19:49.642
Hmm, maybe after
a long, dark night,

19:49.643 --> 19:51.244
the sun is starting
to rise on Greendale.

19:51.245 --> 19:54.247
Maybe. Maybe not.

19:54.248 --> 19:56.915
You never can tell what kind
of day you're gonna have.

19:56.916 --> 19:58.850
Okay, I didn't really avoid
sitting on them.

19:58.851 --> 20:00.685
I sat right on them.

20:00.686 --> 20:02.254
- Oh.
- Aw.

20:02.255 --> 20:03.555
- I'm sorry.
- Pierce, I'm sorry.

20:03.556 --> 20:04.856
Hurt like hell.

20:04.857 --> 20:06.791
I saw eagles.

20:17.442 --> 20:19.537
♪ Troy and Abed
in the morning ♪

20:19.538 --> 20:20.939
Today we're joined
by Annie Edison...

20:20.940 --> 20:22.206
- Hi!
- Who's gonna show us how

20:22.207 --> 20:23.641
to spruce up your
apartment on a budget.

20:23.642 --> 20:25.043
So, Annie, what
inspired this throw?

20:25.044 --> 20:27.478
Well, I just thought
that I'd cover up the stain

20:27.479 --> 20:29.646
where Abed spilled code red
on the couch last week.

20:29.647 --> 20:30.981
Oops. Crafty.

20:30.982 --> 20:32.583
And you have some tips
on entertaining.

20:32.584 --> 20:34.417
Yes, if you're
expecting company,

20:34.418 --> 20:36.720
but you don't have enough
chairs, you can bring out

20:36.721 --> 20:39.322
pillows from your bedroom and
use them on the floor

20:39.323 --> 20:40.757
for a Moroccan feel.

20:40.758 --> 20:42.859
- Ooh, a taste of the Orient.
- Ooh!

20:42.860 --> 20:45.527
Actually, boys, I have
a little surprise for you.

20:45.528 --> 20:46.562
- Uh-oh.
- While you two were out

20:46.563 --> 20:47.730
playing blazer tag...

20:47.731 --> 20:49.498
That's laser tag
with sport coats.

20:49.499 --> 20:53.102
I did a little extreme
bedroom makeover!

20:53.103 --> 20:56.438
I unbunked your beds and got
scrap fabric and...

20:56.439 --> 20:59.341
It's okay, buddy.

20:59.342 --> 21:00.341
We can put it back.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.542
We can put it back
the way it was.

21:01.543 --> 21:02.811
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

21:02.812 --> 21:05.413
It's... cut, Garrett.

21:05.414 --> 21:06.715
Sorry!
