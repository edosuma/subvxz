WEBVTT

01:46.381 --> 01:47.549
Mom!

01:48.650 --> 01:50.720
No, no, you
coddle him too much.

01:50.753 --> 01:51.586
I'll handle it.

01:53.256 --> 01:56.259
He's got to learn not to
be so scared of the dark.

02:01.264 --> 02:02.765
He's only six years old.

02:11.908 --> 02:12.775
I want my mom.

02:13.642 --> 02:15.711
Well, you got me.

02:17.546 --> 02:19.347
There's a monster in my room.

02:20.783 --> 02:22.251
Where?

02:22.285 --> 02:23.552
Under my bed.

02:30.425 --> 02:32.995
No monsters, now
you go to sleep.

02:34.964 --> 02:35.965
I want some water.

02:48.443 --> 02:53.381
Jason, do you remember
what we talked about, hmm?

02:54.250 --> 02:55.383
You're a big boy now.

02:58.221 --> 03:00.022
He just pretended to look.

03:02.892 --> 03:03.726
I'll look.

03:08.030 --> 03:09.932
There's nothing under there.

03:09.966 --> 03:13.703
Now, do you really
need some water?

03:13.736 --> 03:14.904
No.

03:14.937 --> 03:17.974
Okay,
everything's okay then?

03:18.875 --> 03:20.442
I love you, Mommy.

03:20.475 --> 03:21.576
I love you more.

03:24.013 --> 03:25.748
Muah, get some sleep.

03:35.858 --> 03:40.096
Tell you what, tomorrow, we'll
go find you a special friend.

03:40.129 --> 03:42.098
You know, like a stuffed
animal or something

03:42.131 --> 03:44.466
to keep you save at night, okay?

04:04.887 --> 04:07.390
Good job, all right, let's go.

04:08.556 --> 04:10.359
Maybe we'll find
something in here.

04:10.393 --> 04:12.895
Look, look, it's there,
it's all over the place.

04:12.929 --> 04:14.030
Oh, I love it, cobblestone.

04:14.063 --> 04:15.298
Yeah, yeah, cool.

04:17.166 --> 04:18.433
Let's find an elephant.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.635
Oh, let's see if
we can find that.

04:20.668 --> 04:21.469
Mom, look.

04:21.503 --> 04:22.705
He's big.

04:22.738 --> 04:24.941
Yeah, hey, that's bigger.

04:24.974 --> 04:25.775
Yes.

04:25.808 --> 04:26.641
Or maybe not.

04:27.877 --> 04:29.378
Oh, these are cool.

04:29.412 --> 04:30.680
Oh, they are.

04:31.814 --> 04:33.316
They've got all
kinds of cool stuff.

04:43.259 --> 04:46.528
Oh, I haven't seen
that since I was 12.

04:48.197 --> 04:51.233
Come on, come on,
Jason, let's go.

04:55.004 --> 04:56.638
All right, you gotta
stay with me, all right?

04:56.671 --> 04:58.007
Okay, oh cool!

04:59.275 --> 05:00.642
Honey, don't touch anything.

05:08.384 --> 05:09.785
Hello.

05:09.819 --> 05:11.653
Oh, oh.

05:11.687 --> 05:16.658
Are you looking for something
specific or just browsing?

05:16.692 --> 05:19.328
Um, just browsing I guess.

05:26.634 --> 05:29.105
Hey, Mister, I
kinda like this one.

05:29.138 --> 05:31.539
Oh, honey, I don't think
that that one's for sale.

05:31.573 --> 05:34.377
Oh, it's all right, ma'am.

05:34.410 --> 05:38.447
He's a very special one,
he is, Patrick O'Malley.

05:38.481 --> 05:40.182
He's special all right.

05:44.353 --> 05:47.323
He's sad, he looks
like he needs a friend.

05:48.424 --> 05:52.795
Well, that's because,
well, well, wait.

05:54.230 --> 05:58.868
Yes, I think he needs a little
bit of my special attention.

06:00.036 --> 06:01.237
Honey, why do
you like that one?

06:01.270 --> 06:05.540
Why don't we, is that a
burn mark on his face.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.676
Yes, it is, a burn mark.

06:09.078 --> 06:12.547
See, he needs somebody
to take care of him.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.050
Why don't we just
keep looking, honey.

06:14.083 --> 06:16.452
I'm sure that Patrick
is very special,

06:16.485 --> 06:19.021
but I think if we find something
else, you'll feel a lot...

06:19.055 --> 06:21.357
Oh, no, he is very special.

06:22.691 --> 06:24.493
Let me tell you a
story about him.

06:25.861 --> 06:30.332
Not so very long ago, in a
place not so very far from here,

06:32.234 --> 06:34.870
Georgia had a gold
rush that occurred

06:34.904 --> 06:38.240
20 years before
the California one,

06:40.943 --> 06:43.379
and leprechauns love gold.

06:49.952 --> 06:54.423
Now, our tale has finished
and our story's complete,

06:54.457 --> 06:57.993
don't be sad, dear ones, for
was the ending not sweet?

06:59.395 --> 07:02.932
Now, be off to your homes,
dears, and fast on your feet.

07:02.965 --> 07:06.402
Happy Halloween
everyone, trick-or-treat.

07:07.669 --> 07:11.273
Mommy, why didn't
Daddy call tonight?

07:11.307 --> 07:12.541
He always does.

07:12.575 --> 07:14.176
I'm sure he was
very busy, honey.

07:16.245 --> 07:18.948
I wanted to tell him
about my Halloween costume.

07:19.849 --> 07:21.417
He'll call tomorrow, I'm sure.

07:21.450 --> 07:22.952
You can tell him then.

07:24.186 --> 07:25.020
Ready for sleep?

07:26.856 --> 07:27.923
Monster check.

07:32.294 --> 07:33.762
No monsters here.

07:36.866 --> 07:37.700
All clear.

07:42.438 --> 07:44.340
No monsters.

07:44.373 --> 07:45.241
I want Zachary.

07:54.150 --> 07:55.351
There was leprechauns.

07:57.987 --> 07:59.654
Who told you that?

07:59.688 --> 08:00.689
Bobby at school.

08:01.857 --> 08:02.791
Oh, don't worry about them.

08:02.825 --> 08:04.326
They're just fairy shoemakers.

08:04.360 --> 08:05.628
I wanna
meet the leprechauns.

08:05.660 --> 08:07.196
Now, that's enough
about leprechauns.

08:07.229 --> 08:08.063
Go to sleep.

08:12.935 --> 08:17.106
Sleep tight, don't let the
bedbugs bite, love you.

08:20.476 --> 08:22.378
I don't wanna meet a leprechaun.

08:36.792 --> 08:38.594
How's the book report coming?

08:38.626 --> 08:39.461
Fine.

08:45.401 --> 08:47.970
Mom, this place is like
out of some horror film.

08:49.038 --> 08:50.239
It's creepy and gross.

08:56.045 --> 08:57.546
There are these kids at school,

08:57.580 --> 09:00.015
and they were telling me some
weird story about this house.

09:01.217 --> 09:02.618
Weird, in what ways?

09:04.019 --> 09:08.123
Well, it's, it's
weird.

09:11.126 --> 09:12.328
Katelin, it's Halloween.

09:12.361 --> 09:14.363
They were just probably
trying to scare you.

09:15.564 --> 09:16.765
Well, my friend, Terry,

09:16.799 --> 09:18.033
said something about all
these bloody murders,

09:18.067 --> 09:19.468
and I was just wondering...

09:19.501 --> 09:21.103
Well, I hate to contradict
the all-knowing Terry,

09:21.136 --> 09:23.539
but there were no bloody
murders in this house.

09:24.673 --> 09:25.908
I love this house.

09:27.243 --> 09:29.144
I used to come here when
I was a little girl.

09:29.178 --> 09:31.113
My great-grandmother lived here.

09:32.047 --> 09:33.482
The one you were named after.

09:35.317 --> 09:37.286
That's when Susan
and I became friends.

09:38.787 --> 09:41.557
Terry said all sorts of bad
things happened in this place.

09:43.425 --> 09:45.928
Did you know this place
was called Irish Mountain?

09:47.830 --> 09:49.498
Yeah, I knew that.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.703
Look, it's been a long night.

09:53.737 --> 09:56.605
Let's talk about this tomorrow.

09:56.639 --> 09:58.907
Tomorrow's Halloween,
can we get pizza

09:58.941 --> 10:00.909
before we go trick-or-treating?

10:00.943 --> 10:02.011
That would be fine.

10:03.979 --> 10:06.115
We have a right to know if
evil, creepy, little monsters

10:06.148 --> 10:07.316
are living in this place.

10:07.349 --> 10:10.219
Katelin, really,
would I intentionally

10:10.252 --> 10:12.756
put your life in
harms way, monsters?

11:47.851 --> 11:51.688
The more sounds she noticed,
the creepier the house felt.

11:53.155 --> 11:55.591
Just as she was thinking
these morbid thoughts,

12:00.195 --> 12:01.997
a face appears in the window,

12:03.733 --> 12:06.034
one that clearly did
not wish to be seen.

12:36.999 --> 12:39.903
Susan, what're you doing
lurking on my front porch?

12:39.935 --> 12:41.704
What're you doing
with the knife?

12:43.773 --> 12:44.640
Would
you like some cider?

12:44.673 --> 12:45.809
I just made some.

12:45.842 --> 12:47.209
Yeah.

12:47.242 --> 12:49.679
Surprised Irish Mountain
was on your route.

12:49.712 --> 12:53.949
I was just ah, seeing
how you were settling in.

12:55.417 --> 12:57.687
Changed routes with
Dooley and thought, well,

13:00.522 --> 13:02.257
I wanted to come
bang on your door.

13:03.425 --> 13:04.861
Honestly, Susan,
some kids at school

13:04.894 --> 13:08.230
have been telling my
kids these wild stories

13:08.263 --> 13:10.666
about leprechauns
committing murder.

13:11.967 --> 13:13.502
I'm having enough
trouble convincing her

13:13.535 --> 13:15.604
we're not moving back
to Atlanta as it is.

13:16.906 --> 13:18.040
Well, Halloween's coming up.

13:18.073 --> 13:21.076
They're focused on scary stuff.

13:21.109 --> 13:22.812
Besides, those stories
are partly true.

13:22.846 --> 13:24.046
Oh, not you too.

13:25.214 --> 13:27.750
We both know
what happened that day.

13:27.784 --> 13:29.251
They're just stories.

13:30.452 --> 13:31.453
I know what I saw.

13:34.056 --> 13:35.224
Look, we were little kids.

13:35.257 --> 13:36.558
We were probably just
imagining things.

13:37.459 --> 13:38.828
12 is pretty old.

13:38.862 --> 13:40.295
I think I know what I saw.

13:41.764 --> 13:44.968
Well, I have been kind
of uncomfortable here.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.435
I thought it was
because I moved back

13:46.468 --> 13:48.203
into my great-grandmother's
old house,

13:48.237 --> 13:52.307
but there's something
weird about that fireplace.

13:54.576 --> 13:55.778
What's wrong with it?

13:57.112 --> 13:57.981
That's just it.

13:58.848 --> 14:00.683
Maybe the kids are right,

14:00.717 --> 14:04.019
because at night it
really gets to you.

14:06.789 --> 14:09.424
You know, for a
lady that writes scary stories,

14:09.458 --> 14:11.761
you're kind of antsy.

14:11.794 --> 14:15.030
Oh yeah, well, with
everybody talking about

14:15.063 --> 14:16.498
what they've been talking about,

14:16.532 --> 14:18.768
it's just, you know,
made me a little nervous.

14:20.135 --> 14:21.570
And?

14:21.603 --> 14:24.439
And brought back some memories
I'd rather not think about.

14:25.909 --> 14:27.543
Do you still have the coin?

14:27.576 --> 14:28.978
The one from the cemetery?

14:30.178 --> 14:32.614
I haven't seen that
since I was like 13.

14:32.648 --> 14:34.616
Well, that's not what's
chasing us, you know.

14:34.650 --> 14:35.985
So you've said.

14:37.352 --> 14:39.889
Seriously, Jess,
remember the graves?

14:43.225 --> 14:44.426
Boy, you're stubborn.

14:45.929 --> 14:49.766
Well, your great, great, or
however many great-grandmother,

14:51.066 --> 14:53.302
right next to her grave
was a smaller grave.

14:53.335 --> 14:55.437
It was probably a child.

14:55.470 --> 14:56.638
It wasn't a child.

14:56.672 --> 14:57.439
Look, I'll take you
there right now.

14:57.472 --> 14:58.607
We can go look at it.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.143
No, I'm not ever
going back there, ever.

15:01.176 --> 15:02.779
I've gotta tell the
kids to stay away,

15:02.812 --> 15:06.481
and tomorrow I have
to tell them something

15:06.515 --> 15:08.283
about the legend
of the leprechaun.

15:11.653 --> 15:13.255
Well, I gotta go back to work.

15:15.792 --> 15:17.659
You probably won't be
attacked by a leprechaun

15:17.694 --> 15:20.562
in at least the next
two days I figure.

15:22.732 --> 15:24.166
Catch you later, doll.

15:24.199 --> 15:25.034
Bye.

15:33.776 --> 15:37.013
Hey, honey, is
Ireland beautiful?

15:37.046 --> 15:40.115
It's
green, so beautiful.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.751
Wish we moved here instead.

15:41.784 --> 15:44.353
Oh yeah,
the kids will love that.

15:45.420 --> 15:46.488
Is everything okay?

15:47.389 --> 15:50.192
Yeah, just tired.

15:50.225 --> 15:52.294
Almost finished
unpacking all the boxes.

15:54.229 --> 15:55.832
Hold on, the kids wanna say hi.

15:55.865 --> 15:58.768
Hey, kids, come
say hi to your dad!

16:02.404 --> 16:05.775
Hi, Dad, guess who I'm
gonna be for Halloween?

16:06.843 --> 16:09.012
A wizard, he's the coolest...

16:09.045 --> 16:09.946
Dork, give me a chance.

16:09.979 --> 16:11.413
Don't call your brother names.

16:11.446 --> 16:13.082
I'm going as an
Amazon warrior.

16:14.316 --> 16:16.953
Oh, wish I could be
there with you guys,

16:16.986 --> 16:19.521
should be heading to the
airport in about 30 minutes.

16:19.554 --> 16:21.156
I'll see you tomorrow.

16:21.189 --> 16:24.927
Safe travels, hey kids,
go get ready for school.

16:24.961 --> 16:26.328
It's almost time for the bus.

16:26.361 --> 16:27.162
Bye, Dad.

16:27.195 --> 16:28.097
Bye, Dad!

16:28.131 --> 16:29.866
Bye, guys, have a good day.

16:35.637 --> 16:36.773
So, what's up, Jess?

16:37.740 --> 16:39.709
You look really stressed.

16:39.742 --> 16:40.977
Ah, it's just the move.

16:42.310 --> 16:45.081
Hurry home, sweetie, I love you.

16:45.114 --> 16:46.783
Love you too, bye.

16:51.286 --> 16:54.724
All right, kids, go
get your book bags!

18:49.839 --> 18:50.807
You don't scare me.

19:48.030 --> 19:52.702
Oh, paper
towels, paper towels.

23:58.280 --> 23:59.181
Mom, I'm home!

23:59.215 --> 24:01.183
Mom, I'm home!

24:12.161 --> 24:14.597
Hey, I wanted one.

24:22.605 --> 24:24.340
Hey, kids, how was school?

24:24.373 --> 24:25.608
Cool.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.276
Ronnie Jackson got suspended.

24:27.309 --> 24:30.179
He brought a bag of frogs and
let them loose in math class.

24:30.212 --> 24:31.780
Who's Ronnie Jackson?

24:31.814 --> 24:34.250
Just a boy in my math class.

24:34.283 --> 24:35.284
Is he cute?

24:37.386 --> 24:39.054
Well, I thought
so until today.

24:39.922 --> 24:41.423
Frogs are the creepiest.

24:41.457 --> 24:42.925
I like frogs.

24:42.958 --> 24:44.426
Of course you
do, you're an icky boy.

24:44.460 --> 24:45.494
I'm not icky.

24:47.196 --> 24:48.030
Cool doll.

24:49.865 --> 24:51.333
Where'd
you get that?

24:52.468 --> 24:55.538
I um, I went out
to the mailbox today,

24:55.571 --> 24:56.772
and when I got
back to the house,

24:56.805 --> 25:00.576
he was sitting on
the front porch.

25:00.609 --> 25:02.611
You didn't see who left it?

25:02.645 --> 25:04.547
Maybe it was your
Ronnie Jackson.

25:04.580 --> 25:06.849
He's not my Ronnie Jackson.

25:06.882 --> 25:08.350
Maybe he might've been

25:08.384 --> 25:10.619
if he hadn't pulled that
stupid stunt, so immature.

25:12.054 --> 25:13.489
Well, Susan's gonna go
trick-or-treating with us,

25:13.522 --> 25:16.192
so go ahead and get your
homework done, or no pizza.

25:21.530 --> 25:22.998
You promised!

25:37.546 --> 25:38.881
Oh, you look great.

25:38.914 --> 25:40.616
I need to pay for that.

25:40.649 --> 25:41.650
Already done, my lady?

25:41.685 --> 25:42.484
Oh, thank you.

25:42.518 --> 25:43.719
Hey kids, pizza!

25:47.756 --> 25:49.258
I love your costume.

25:49.291 --> 25:50.192
Thanks.

25:50.226 --> 25:51.427
Hey, kids, why don't you

25:51.460 --> 25:52.728
take your plates
into the kitchen,

25:52.761 --> 25:54.163
and go get your costumes on?

25:59.235 --> 26:00.069
All right.

26:16.518 --> 26:18.254
What the hell is this?

26:18.287 --> 26:20.122
It's the creepiest thing.

26:20.155 --> 26:22.692
This afternoon when I
went to the mailbox,

26:22.726 --> 26:24.159
I got back to the house,

26:24.193 --> 26:26.328
that leprechaun doll was
sitting on the front porch.

26:31.233 --> 26:32.401
It's very funny, Susan.

26:32.434 --> 26:33.737
I didn't do it.

26:34.738 --> 26:35.938
Well, it must've been some kid.

26:35.971 --> 26:37.072
It wasn't me.

26:38.674 --> 26:40.843
Do you have any idea
what blood for gold means?

26:44.546 --> 26:45.347
Never mind.

26:47.950 --> 26:49.151
So, did you tell them?

26:50.019 --> 26:51.520
It was just like I expected.

26:51.553 --> 26:53.922
As soon as they find out I
think I saw a leprechaun,

26:53.956 --> 26:55.491
they wanna go where I saw it.

26:56.659 --> 26:59.261
So, take them and show them.

26:59.295 --> 27:01.263
Maybe it'll make
all this go away.

27:01.297 --> 27:02.531
Yeah, they'd probably go

27:02.564 --> 27:04.600
looking for it on
their own anyway.

27:04.633 --> 27:05.769
I know, we chase kids

27:05.801 --> 27:07.436
out of that old
cemetery all the time.

27:09.204 --> 27:10.639
Where did you come from?

27:12.308 --> 27:14.744
There wasn't a card, nothing?

27:14.778 --> 27:15.779
Nothing.

27:15.811 --> 27:17.112
That is strange.

27:20.616 --> 27:21.817
You know what?

27:21.850 --> 27:22.686
This is stupid.

27:36.365 --> 27:38.267
That's the end of that.

27:46.208 --> 27:49.511
Oh, you
guys look great.

27:49.545 --> 27:52.181
Two Amazon warriors,
yours is old.

27:53.717 --> 27:54.550
It's perfect.

27:55.685 --> 27:57.319
Should've made
Daniel a leprechaun.

27:59.455 --> 28:01.357
Hey, have you guys
got your flashlights?

28:01.390 --> 28:02.792
I'll go get mine.

28:51.540 --> 28:52.742
Sure you don't wanna come?

28:52.776 --> 28:54.209
Think of all the
candy you'll miss.

28:54.243 --> 28:56.512
Yeah, my head's killing me.

28:56.545 --> 29:00.082
Anyway, I get a percentage
of the kid's haul, have fun.

29:28.510 --> 29:29.679
Where are you?

29:40.589 --> 29:43.025
Wow, look how
beautiful nature is.

29:43.058 --> 29:45.862
I know, so pretty.

29:45.895 --> 29:46.729
Yeah.

29:51.500 --> 29:52.334
Look.

30:10.085 --> 30:12.521
Is that gold?

30:12.554 --> 30:14.623
Do you think it's real?

30:30.974 --> 30:33.308
I gotta look.

31:36.973 --> 31:39.876
Mom,
what're you doing?

31:41.243 --> 31:45.347
Ah, deary, I'll be putting
away things for sure.

31:45.380 --> 31:48.250
Why are you talking like that?

31:48.283 --> 31:50.019
Like what, deary?

31:50.053 --> 31:51.955
You sound like
Merida from Brave.

31:54.389 --> 31:57.192
Go to bed, Katie,
everything's fine.

31:59.528 --> 32:01.196
Mom, Mom, take it.

32:02.397 --> 32:04.299
Mom, look at all the
great candy I got!

32:06.201 --> 32:08.270
Oh wow, that's amazing.

32:08.303 --> 32:09.706
It's getting late, hotshot.

32:09.739 --> 32:12.107
You can sort your
candy in the morning.

32:12.140 --> 32:13.542
You're acting weird, Mom.

32:15.078 --> 32:16.244
Where's Susan?

32:16.278 --> 32:19.448
Right here, your haul.

32:19.481 --> 32:20.382
It's all I could get.

32:20.415 --> 32:22.618
Oh, thank you, pretty meager.

32:24.119 --> 32:25.320
Now, that's interesting.

32:26.188 --> 32:27.456
Wonder how they did that?

32:29.291 --> 32:30.927
All right, kids, time for bed.

32:30.960 --> 32:33.128
Go brush your teeth and
don't eat any candy.

32:33.161 --> 32:34.596
Time for bed.

32:34.630 --> 32:35.732
Go to bed, go to bed.

32:35.765 --> 32:36.665
Brush your teeth.

32:36.699 --> 32:37.934
I'll be up to tuck you in.

32:38.935 --> 32:39.802
Yeah, were they good?

32:39.836 --> 32:41.004
Yeah, yeah.

32:43.538 --> 32:44.373
Thank you.

32:49.277 --> 32:50.680
Duty calls.

32:50.713 --> 32:53.548
Ah, the perils of
being an Amazon princess.

32:59.154 --> 33:00.355
How's your head?

33:00.389 --> 33:01.691
Oh, it's better, thanks.

33:02.692 --> 33:03.960
All right, goodnight.

35:54.596 --> 35:57.632
Now it's my turn, you
little, green shit.

37:09.705 --> 37:10.538
Damn.

37:14.542 --> 37:16.012
People have long speculated

37:16.045 --> 37:18.647
that when the Irish populated
the North Georgia mountains,

37:18.681 --> 37:20.515
a clan of leprechauns
came with them.

37:21.650 --> 37:23.019
Folklorists believe
the leprechauns,

37:23.052 --> 37:25.288
which are said to be
surly, if not evil,

37:25.321 --> 37:29.926
settled on Irish Mountain and
mined gold from there, hmm.

38:07.462 --> 38:08.663
Gotcha!

38:08.698 --> 38:10.433
Legend suggests the
leprechauns lost control

38:10.465 --> 38:13.336
of the property to a
woman named Katie Kelly.

38:15.004 --> 38:17.073
Katie Kelly was
said to have married

38:17.106 --> 38:18.941
one of the little people.

38:18.975 --> 38:21.243
The goldmine is believed to
be on Mrs. Kelly's property,

38:21.277 --> 38:24.180
also known as Irish Mountain
to this day known as founder.

38:26.782 --> 38:28.384
I knew you couldn't resist.

39:21.003 --> 39:23.671
That's all you've got?

40:10.820 --> 40:12.054
According the the folklore,

40:12.088 --> 40:15.458
leprechauns require
the blood sacrifice

40:15.491 --> 40:17.592
of a female descendant
of Mrs. Kelly's

40:17.625 --> 40:19.661
in order to reopen
the lost goldmine.

40:19.695 --> 40:21.831
Upon her death in 1906,

40:21.864 --> 40:24.400
Mrs. Kelly's daughter
claimed her final words were

40:27.369 --> 40:28.304
blood for gold.

40:29.472 --> 40:32.908
Oh, shit, alluding to
the person which, oh no.

40:32.942 --> 40:34.609
Dear God, Jess.

42:04.233 --> 42:05.034
Jess.

42:05.067 --> 42:05.868
Oh my God, Jess!

42:05.901 --> 42:06.702
Are you okay?

42:06.735 --> 42:08.637
What the hell happened?

42:10.039 --> 42:12.208
Jess, are you all right?

42:12.241 --> 42:14.410
Hey, hey, easy, easy.

42:14.443 --> 42:15.344
Easy, come on, hey.

42:16.512 --> 42:17.546
You're home.

42:17.580 --> 42:18.948
Hey, yeah, hey.

42:21.650 --> 42:22.551
Easy, easy.

42:24.053 --> 42:25.487
Should I call an ambulance?

42:26.322 --> 42:27.756
No, no, no.

43:02.925 --> 43:03.759
No!

43:09.565 --> 43:12.534
It, it was.

43:16.772 --> 43:18.207
Mom, what happened?

43:18.240 --> 43:19.341
Dad!

43:19.375 --> 43:21.977
Hey, buddy, mm, I missed you.

43:23.312 --> 43:24.780
Presents.

43:24.813 --> 43:27.416
Yeah, that one's
yours and that one's yours.

43:28.718 --> 43:29.551
A leprechaun.

43:32.254 --> 43:33.489
Thank you, Dad!

43:35.190 --> 43:36.025
Daniel!

43:48.671 --> 43:50.839
And they never found
the other two dolls.

43:52.074 --> 43:53.542
I want this one, Mommy.

43:53.575 --> 43:55.611
Oh no, honey, why don't
we just keep looking, okay?

43:55.644 --> 43:58.914
I'm sure that Patrick
is very happy here.

43:58.947 --> 43:59.848
Come on, honey, let's go.

43:59.882 --> 44:01.150
Mommy, is that story true?

44:01.183 --> 44:04.053
Oh, honey, I'm sure
it's just a story.

44:04.086 --> 44:07.757
Well, it, it's a story,

44:07.791 --> 44:12.796
but, but everyone has
a story, even them.

44:15.297 --> 44:16.965
He doesn't look that scary.

44:22.004 --> 44:25.607
There's nothing scary
about a leprechaun.

44:27.876 --> 44:29.679
Look around, my little friend.

44:30.814 --> 44:34.083
We have lots of
dolls and toys here.

44:34.116 --> 44:36.251
Surely, one of them
will catch your eye.

44:40.556 --> 44:42.124
Oh, oh, goodness.

44:47.863 --> 44:49.031
What happened to her?

44:49.064 --> 44:50.767
She looks worse
than the leprechaun.

44:51.900 --> 44:56.338
Patty is very old,
very old indeed.

44:56.372 --> 45:00.209
Well, she goes back all
the way to the 1800s.

45:00.242 --> 45:02.712
Oh, is she porcelain?

45:03.979 --> 45:08.917
Porcelain, no, she's
much older than that.

45:10.687 --> 45:13.655
Porcelain would
have a shiny glaze.

45:15.457 --> 45:17.292
I believe she came from Germany.

45:19.128 --> 45:21.597
How she got here I don't know.

45:21.630 --> 45:22.732
How'd she break.

45:22.766 --> 45:24.666
Did you drop her?

45:24.701 --> 45:26.703
Jason, honey, that's,
that's not polite.

45:26.736 --> 45:28.537
No,
no, no, little one.

45:30.439 --> 45:33.942
I wasn't the one who
broke her delicate soul.

45:36.578 --> 45:40.115
No, I'm, I'm afraid
she was broken

45:40.149 --> 45:42.084
long before her face cracked.

45:43.285 --> 45:45.755
I'm sorry, I, I
don't understand.

45:48.357 --> 45:50.459
Yeah, I leave for
the convention in the morning.

45:51.927 --> 45:53.595
This isn't
a doll show again, is it?

45:53.629 --> 45:54.898
No, it's not
another doll show.

45:54.930 --> 45:56.866
It's a science
fiction convention.

45:58.300 --> 46:01.236
Will there be
any eligible young men there?

46:01.270 --> 46:04.406
I'm not sure what kind
of men are gonna be there,

46:04.440 --> 46:07.509
but there will be some brand
of testosterone present.

46:09.244 --> 46:14.249
Good heavens, yes,
there will be men there.

46:15.417 --> 46:16.618
Thank
goodness for that.

46:16.652 --> 46:18.788
Are you taking your
dolls to the show?

46:18.822 --> 46:19.856
Some of them.

46:20.956 --> 46:22.157
As many as I can anyway.

46:23.325 --> 46:24.426
You're
not gonna make yourself

46:24.460 --> 46:25.728
look ridiculous again, are you?

46:25.762 --> 46:27.396
I'm not gonna look ridiculous.

46:27.429 --> 46:29.498
I'll be in costume, never mind.

46:32.134 --> 46:33.669
You're a lovely girl,

46:33.703 --> 46:35.637
but you're not getting
any younger, missy.

46:38.240 --> 46:39.074
Abby?

46:41.243 --> 46:42.644
Yeah, I'm here.

46:43.847 --> 46:45.815
You
sound distracted.

46:45.849 --> 46:47.449
I'm just waiting on a package.

46:48.650 --> 46:51.487
Not
another doll, I hope.

46:51.520 --> 46:54.256
Actually, it is another doll.

46:55.657 --> 46:58.427
You're
always playing with dolls.

46:58.460 --> 47:01.296
How are you gonna
meet any young men?

47:01.330 --> 47:03.298
How old are you now anyhow, 30?

47:03.332 --> 47:05.935
I'm only 28, and I,

47:05.969 --> 47:08.972
I think I've still got a
few good years left in me.

47:09.004 --> 47:10.506
Not that anyone would want me.

47:12.709 --> 47:15.077
Look, Aunt Sally,
I gotta go, okay?

47:16.044 --> 47:17.479
I'll talk to you later, bye.

47:40.135 --> 47:44.841
Hi, Crystal, it's
Abby, Abby Freeman.

47:46.408 --> 47:49.746
I'm still waiting on the
package to come in the mail.

47:49.779 --> 47:51.014
I'm coming to your
workshop this weekend,

47:51.046 --> 47:54.182
and I'm really looking
forward to seeing you.

47:55.284 --> 47:57.720
Call me back if you can, bye.

48:22.311 --> 48:23.145
Patty?

48:28.051 --> 48:29.217
Where are you?

49:29.611 --> 49:33.181
Patty,
you frightened me.

49:34.817 --> 49:36.184
Where have you been?

49:36.218 --> 49:39.856
What are you
wishing for, my dearest Abby?

49:39.889 --> 49:41.057
My new doll.

49:42.157 --> 49:43.059
My Abby doll,

49:45.061 --> 49:46.796
and then my wish will come true.

49:46.829 --> 49:49.766
And what wish
might that be, pray tell?

49:49.799 --> 49:53.036
To be beautiful like a
doll, like all my dolls

49:55.270 --> 49:56.571
before you destroyed them.

50:00.275 --> 50:01.711
You have me.

50:01.744 --> 50:03.612
You have no need of anyone else.

50:05.915 --> 50:10.218
I am the only one stayed by
your side after the fire.

50:10.252 --> 50:13.056
Everyone else abandoned us.

50:13.089 --> 50:14.691
We only have each other.

50:17.160 --> 50:20.763
We belong together forever.

50:26.401 --> 50:27.235
It's here.

50:54.797 --> 50:56.099
She's beautiful.

51:14.616 --> 51:18.487
Patty, you're not
gonna hurt this one.

52:15.310 --> 52:17.180
Your wagon's taking
up all the room.

52:20.983 --> 52:21.884
Look at this.

52:21.918 --> 52:22.651
What's this a freak show?

52:26.354 --> 52:30.325
You need to give all these
dolls a ride to the junk heap.

52:32.228 --> 52:33.361
Why don't
you shut your yap,

52:33.395 --> 52:35.564
you cock sucking son of a bitch?

52:35.597 --> 52:38.868
Hey, nobody talks
to me like that.

52:41.536 --> 52:43.572
I warned you.

52:43.605 --> 52:46.943
Look, Doc, that
doll just attacked me.

52:46.976 --> 52:49.644
Jack, go sleep it off.

53:00.323 --> 53:01.590
Abby Freeman?

53:03.259 --> 53:04.060
Holy.

53:04.093 --> 53:04.894
Jeremy?

53:04.927 --> 53:06.062
What're you do, I...

53:06.095 --> 53:07.296
I didn't wanna
take the elevator.

53:07.330 --> 53:09.364
Here, let me give
you a hand with this.

53:12.702 --> 53:13.903
Wait is that?

53:13.936 --> 53:16.671
That's Patty, you
remember her, don't you?

53:16.706 --> 53:19.674
Yeah, she looks a little
worse for wear, but...

53:19.709 --> 53:22.444
The fire, remember how
it changed both of us?

53:24.347 --> 53:29.151
Shit, yeah, um, I'm sorry.

53:31.087 --> 53:32.454
It's okay.

53:32.487 --> 53:33.890
God, it's so good to see you.

53:33.923 --> 53:36.158
Do you, like, are you
running off somewhere?

53:36.192 --> 53:39.195
Do you think we could get
together a little bit later, talk?

53:42.832 --> 53:43.665
Yeah.

53:56.478 --> 53:59.749
Ah, let me give
you a hand with this.

54:11.861 --> 54:13.696
So, how have you been?

54:25.440 --> 54:27.475
After the fire, I
never heard from you.

54:28.377 --> 54:29.712
I couldn't find you.

54:31.113 --> 54:33.548
I mean everywhere I looked
just turned up just dead end.

54:35.550 --> 54:38.120
It was like you vanished
off the face of the earth.

54:40.756 --> 54:42.124
Then we moved up North.

54:42.158 --> 54:43.359
I ended up going to
college up there.

54:43.392 --> 54:46.362
It's okay, no big deal.

54:49.464 --> 54:52.101
I didn't mean to drop
the ball, I'm sorry.

54:53.402 --> 54:54.502
It's not your fault.

54:55.838 --> 54:57.639
They moved me to a
different rehab facility,

54:57.672 --> 55:01.777
then another surgery,
and then more,

55:04.880 --> 55:06.716
you know, typical
nightmare stuff.

55:09.185 --> 55:10.585
Where'd you go after that?

55:12.321 --> 55:14.223
I had to move in
with my crazy aunt.

55:15.958 --> 55:16.859
And now?

55:20.363 --> 55:22.064
I was able to use some
of the insurance settlement

55:22.098 --> 55:24.066
to buy a little house
in Granite Creek.

55:25.368 --> 55:26.836
Do you live alone?

55:27.937 --> 55:30.773
It's just me and my dolls.

55:36.078 --> 55:38.646
Yeah, do you always take
her everywhere with you?

55:38.681 --> 55:39.782
Don't judge Patty.

55:43.518 --> 55:46.022
She was there for me
when no one else was.

55:46.055 --> 55:48.224
Okay, okay.

55:55.563 --> 55:59.301
I'm gonna run to the
restroom really quick.

56:06.909 --> 56:07.910
Well, here we are.

56:30.733 --> 56:32.268
You really freak me out.

56:44.914 --> 56:47.283
Is everything okay.

56:47.316 --> 56:49.151
Never mind, it's nothing.

56:51.554 --> 56:53.956
I've got that D and B panel
coming up I gotta go get to,

56:53.989 --> 56:57.460
but maybe we can
get together after?

57:01.063 --> 57:01.897
I'd like that.

57:04.300 --> 57:05.134
Great.

57:24.487 --> 57:26.755
Could Jeremy really
wanna be with me again?

57:28.124 --> 57:30.759
He thinks
you're ugly just like me,

57:30.793 --> 57:32.461
just like all of us.

57:33.429 --> 57:34.997
You're probably right, Patty.

57:37.733 --> 57:39.468
I guess it's just
wishful thinking.

57:47.576 --> 57:49.578
Hi, Crystal, it's Abby again.

57:49.612 --> 57:52.047
Ah, I've been
trying to reach you.

57:52.081 --> 57:54.717
I've been doing some research
since last year's con.

57:54.750 --> 57:56.152
Remember when you said

57:56.185 --> 57:58.621
magic is in the air
at the convention?

57:58.653 --> 58:00.022
I know everybody else
thought you were joking,

58:00.055 --> 58:02.525
but I could tell that
you were talking to me.

58:02.558 --> 58:05.060
It's like we had
this connection.

58:05.094 --> 58:07.029
Please call me back
as soon as you can.

58:31.787 --> 58:33.289
Crystal is bad.

58:33.322 --> 58:35.624
She only wants to hurt you.

58:35.658 --> 58:36.825
You don't need her.

58:36.859 --> 58:38.327
You only need me.

58:38.360 --> 58:39.995
Patty, stop, that's enough.

58:40.029 --> 58:41.931
Crystal is not bad.

58:41.964 --> 58:44.800
You think
I'm ugly, don't you?

58:44.833 --> 58:47.770
No, of course I don't
think you're ugly,

58:47.803 --> 58:50.105
but every time I've tried to
fix you, you won't let me.

58:50.139 --> 58:52.007
It's because
we belong together,

58:52.041 --> 58:54.877
but now you will
save only yourself.

58:56.845 --> 58:59.615
You want to change
and leave me for him.

58:59.648 --> 59:01.517
No, Patty, I promise.

59:01.550 --> 59:03.252
I will never, ever leave you.

59:03.285 --> 59:06.188
You want to
leave me ugly and alone.

59:26.208 --> 59:30.479
Patty, how could
you do this, her hair.

59:35.217 --> 59:37.219
You promised you'd be nice!

59:38.688 --> 59:39.488
That's it, Patty.

59:39.521 --> 59:40.356
You're coming with me.

59:47.196 --> 59:48.030
Hmm.

59:51.333 --> 59:52.167
Hey.

59:56.405 --> 59:58.874
Um, so, I see you brought
your little friend.

59:58.907 --> 01:00:02.578
Ah, I thought we
were gonna be alone?

01:00:02.611 --> 01:00:04.313
She won't bother us.

01:00:04.346 --> 01:00:06.815
It's a convention after all.

01:00:06.849 --> 01:00:07.684
Yeah.

01:00:09.918 --> 01:00:10.720
You seem excited.

01:00:10.754 --> 01:00:11.587
What's going on?

01:00:15.391 --> 01:00:18.427
There's a workshop that
I've been looking forward to.

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.963
Ah, it's tonight.

01:00:20.996 --> 01:00:22.798
Anything I might
be interested in?

01:00:23.733 --> 01:00:25.634
Oh, I don't, I don't know.

01:00:25.668 --> 01:00:27.670
It's just this lady that
I saw speak last year,

01:00:27.704 --> 01:00:30.439
and I've been waiting all
year to see her again.

01:00:30.472 --> 01:00:34.176
She just talks about telling
fortunes and stuff like that.

01:00:35.344 --> 01:00:36.879
Oh, okay, great.

01:00:39.315 --> 01:00:40.316
You seem happy.

01:00:42.918 --> 01:00:44.721
I guess
it's just better

01:00:44.754 --> 01:00:48.257
to look forward to the
future instead of the past.

01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:49.625
You know what I mean?

01:00:49.658 --> 01:00:51.493
Yeah, absolutely.

01:00:54.396 --> 01:00:56.065
I love seeing this
change in you.

01:00:58.735 --> 01:00:59.902
I love seeing you happy.

01:01:02.204 --> 01:01:04.440
You're even more beautiful
when you're happy.

01:01:06.275 --> 01:01:09.044
It ah, brings back memories.

01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:17.219
I wasn't sure if I
should tell you this,

01:01:19.988 --> 01:01:21.523
but I still have
our old picture.

01:01:23.359 --> 01:01:25.294
The one that we took at
the Valentine's Day dance

01:01:25.327 --> 01:01:26.628
back in school.

01:01:28.364 --> 01:01:29.766
Gosh, I forgot about that.

01:01:32.935 --> 01:01:34.169
I was wearing the fedora.

01:01:34.203 --> 01:01:35.637
I thought that was
so in.

01:01:44.947 --> 01:01:46.081
Jeremy, are you okay?

01:01:46.115 --> 01:01:47.316
Sir, are you all right?

01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:50.018
Yeah, no, fine, I,
something on my nose.

01:01:50.052 --> 01:01:52.187
Do you want me
to get the manager?

01:01:52.221 --> 01:01:56.425
No, no, no need,
it's fine, thank you.

01:01:56.458 --> 01:01:59.027
I think I'm just gonna go.

01:01:59.061 --> 01:01:59.962
Wait, I'll come with you.

01:01:59.995 --> 01:02:01.430
No, no, no, no, it's okay.

01:02:01.463 --> 01:02:05.968
You, you go to your workshop
and ah, I'll go get patched up.

01:02:06.001 --> 01:02:06.902
I'll be all right.

01:02:13.509 --> 01:02:14.778
I kept our photo too.

01:02:28.457 --> 01:02:31.026
How dare you.

01:02:31.059 --> 01:02:32.796
You are out of control.

01:02:47.476 --> 01:02:49.746
Patty, why did you
do that to Jeremy?

01:02:49.779 --> 01:02:51.647
You could've seriously hurt him.

01:02:51.681 --> 01:02:53.382
I don't know what's
gotten into you.

01:02:53.415 --> 01:02:55.317
How could you do this?

01:02:56.518 --> 01:03:00.389
He's bad, I
tried to protect you.

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.134
Jeremy!

01:04:20.636 --> 01:04:23.539
Patty, it's only you.

01:04:24.707 --> 01:04:26.608
I had, it was horrible.

01:04:27.777 --> 01:04:30.112
I had this night, never mind.

01:05:00.810 --> 01:05:02.679
I'm gonna go see Jeremy.

01:05:02.712 --> 01:05:05.048
I decided to tell him I
can't see him anymore.

01:05:10.352 --> 01:05:11.553
Did you hear me, Patty?

01:05:12.689 --> 01:05:14.991
I said I'm not gonna
see him anymore.

01:05:15.024 --> 01:05:17.459
I heard
you, dearest Abby.

01:05:17.492 --> 01:05:19.561
You have made a
decision, have you?

01:05:21.296 --> 01:05:24.633
Well, yeah, I have.

01:05:26.568 --> 01:05:28.136
It's too late for me to change,

01:05:29.806 --> 01:05:31.440
and I'm gonna tell him so.

01:05:31.473 --> 01:05:32.809
I see.

01:05:34.242 --> 01:05:36.578
I'm gonna leave you here so
I can talk to him privately.

01:05:36.612 --> 01:05:37.512
You understand, don't you?

01:05:37.546 --> 01:05:38.547
Certainly.

01:05:39.481 --> 01:05:41.818
Promise me you
won't hurt Abby.

01:05:41.851 --> 01:05:42.852
Of course.

01:05:44.319 --> 01:05:46.121
I'm trusting you to
keep your promise, Patty.

01:05:46.154 --> 01:05:48.825
A promise
should not be forsaken.

01:05:48.858 --> 01:05:52.194
I rejoice in our bounties
of love and trust.

01:05:53.763 --> 01:05:55.263
I knew I could count on you.

01:05:58.667 --> 01:06:00.103
You're my best friend, Patty.

01:06:26.194 --> 01:06:27.030
Hey.

01:06:29.297 --> 01:06:30.198
Can I come in?

01:06:31.466 --> 01:06:32.869
Yeah, of course.

01:06:46.648 --> 01:06:48.151
I see they fixed you up.

01:06:49.317 --> 01:06:51.186
Yeah, they, they
left awhile ago.

01:06:53.255 --> 01:06:54.556
I was worried about you.

01:06:55.725 --> 01:06:56.959
I'll be okay.

01:06:58.695 --> 01:07:00.295
You cut your lip.

01:07:07.469 --> 01:07:08.771
I washed my makeup off.

01:07:13.076 --> 01:07:14.077
I noticed.

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.314
I like you better this way.

01:07:29.424 --> 01:07:31.326
You're beautiful, Abby.

01:07:34.362 --> 01:07:38.034
You've always been
beautiful to me.

01:07:38.067 --> 01:07:39.902
I wouldn't lie to you.

01:07:42.004 --> 01:07:43.338
Do you trust me?

01:07:48.144 --> 01:07:48.978
I do.

01:08:26.048 --> 01:08:29.118
There's a con coming
up in California.

01:08:29.152 --> 01:08:30.185
We could go together.

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:33.256
I'd like that.

01:08:36.323 --> 01:08:38.161
Oh, what about
your little friend?

01:08:42.198 --> 01:08:43.032
No more.

01:08:46.368 --> 01:08:47.703
No more dolls?

01:08:49.604 --> 01:08:50.505
No more Patty.

01:09:04.854 --> 01:09:07.488
I'm glad to see you kept
your promise, Patty.

01:09:07.522 --> 01:09:10.259
I did not
violate my covenant.

01:09:10.292 --> 01:09:11.993
I detest falsehood.

01:09:13.196 --> 01:09:14.197
Do you not agree?

01:09:15.698 --> 01:09:17.066
Yeah, of course I do.

01:09:18.533 --> 01:09:20.736
Blessed are the pure in heart.

01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:22.939
Lying lips are an abomination.

01:09:25.607 --> 01:09:28.944
Is our poor, dearest
boy broken hearted.

01:09:28.978 --> 01:09:31.214
Ah, we cleared the air.

01:09:32.413 --> 01:09:33.515
Everything's good now.

01:09:37.953 --> 01:09:40.122
I know where I belong now.

01:09:41.323 --> 01:09:44.727
Yes, I'll
leave you alone now

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.096
to cleanse away the
sins of your day.

01:11:20.389 --> 01:11:22.792
Patty, what're you doing?

01:11:22.825 --> 01:11:27.063
Complimentary
room service, dearest Abby.

01:11:28.197 --> 01:11:30.099
Did you think you could fool me?

01:11:30.132 --> 01:11:31.267
No, Patty, don't!

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:33.436
You
fornicated with him.

01:11:34.937 --> 01:11:37.106
The stink of him
clings to you still.

01:11:38.874 --> 01:11:40.276
You fornicated with him.

01:11:40.309 --> 01:11:42.111
Patty, you don't understand.

01:11:42.144 --> 01:11:44.013
You want
to abandon me!

01:11:44.046 --> 01:11:45.448
No!

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.450
You wish for
beauty for yourself,

01:11:47.482 --> 01:11:49.752
but would leave
me ugly and alone!

01:11:49.785 --> 01:11:53.655
Patty, I tried to fix you
and you wouldn't let me!

01:11:54.957 --> 01:11:57.326
And now you'll
have your precious wish.

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:00.096
You can be a beautiful doll!

01:12:00.129 --> 01:12:03.366
I offer this sacrifice
oh, father of darkness!

01:12:04.566 --> 01:12:08.270
The flesh of this spirit
shall reek with decay!

01:12:08.304 --> 01:12:11.474
Which is right, I
offer this daughter.

01:12:11.506 --> 01:12:14.877
Oh, master of darkness,
I give unto thee!

01:12:16.812 --> 01:12:20.216
Did you think I would
let you leave me for him?

01:12:20.249 --> 01:12:21.417
Patty!

01:12:21.450 --> 01:12:23.585
Don't
worry, dearest Abby.

01:12:23.618 --> 01:12:26.554
We'll all be together
soon forever.

01:12:29.425 --> 01:12:30.259
Jeremy.

01:12:32.594 --> 01:12:35.865
Be careful
what you wish for.

01:13:08.264 --> 01:13:10.766
Hello, Jeremy, you wanna play?

01:13:11.666 --> 01:13:13.469
No, I didn't think so.

01:13:15.171 --> 01:13:16.839
I've been playing with Abby.

01:13:16.872 --> 01:13:19.475
We've been having so much fun.

01:13:20.976 --> 01:13:21.811
Oh, my God.

01:13:23.746 --> 01:13:25.214
Oops,
gotta get home now.

01:13:25.247 --> 01:13:30.086
It wouldn't do to fall to
pieces

01:13:34.957 --> 01:13:36.992
Abby, what have you done?

01:14:27.843 --> 01:14:32.248
Hello, lover boy,
how nice of you to come.

01:14:32.281 --> 01:14:33.482
Abby, what's going on?

01:14:33.516 --> 01:14:35.650
You and Abby
have been very bad.

01:14:39.255 --> 01:14:40.589
Do you like her?

01:14:41.757 --> 01:14:45.461
I made her just
for you.

01:14:45.494 --> 01:14:50.499
Jeremy, aren't I beautiful?

01:14:53.469 --> 01:14:54.937
My scar is gone.

01:15:01.944 --> 01:15:06.949
Jeremy, look what I can do.

01:15:11.921 --> 01:15:14.924
I have a
surprise for you.

01:15:16.258 --> 01:15:18.194
No, no, stay away.

01:15:18.227 --> 01:15:19.562
Jeremy.

01:15:22.798 --> 01:15:23.632
Jeremy.

01:15:29.038 --> 01:15:29.872
Jeremy.

01:15:30.773 --> 01:15:31.574
Abby, no, no, Abby.

01:15:31.607 --> 01:15:33.809
Hug me and kiss me.

01:15:33.842 --> 01:15:37.179
No!

01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:45.654
Housekeeping!

01:15:52.361 --> 01:15:53.195
What a mess.

01:15:55.231 --> 01:15:57.633
Hey, Mary, come check this out.

01:15:57.666 --> 01:15:59.001
What's going on?

01:15:59.034 --> 01:16:01.003
Somebody
left us a present.

01:16:01.036 --> 01:16:02.771
It's just more junk
for lost and found.

01:16:02.805 --> 01:16:03.872
Not what I say.

01:16:03.906 --> 01:16:05.241
I say finders keepers.

01:16:05.274 --> 01:16:06.676
Some day those
sticky fingers of yours

01:16:06.710 --> 01:16:07.910
is gonna get you in
a lot of trouble.

01:16:07.943 --> 01:16:09.545
I'm keeping them.

01:16:09.578 --> 01:16:11.046
Stealing is stealing.

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:13.115
That's all there is to it.

01:16:13.148 --> 01:16:14.383
Now, these
are gonna make

01:16:14.416 --> 01:16:15.985
a nice present for
my granddaughter.

01:16:42.311 --> 01:16:44.113
Come on, Jason,
let's go, come on.

01:16:45.147 --> 01:16:45.948
Honey, let's go.

01:16:45.981 --> 01:16:46.782
But.

01:16:46.815 --> 01:16:47.616
Honey.

01:16:47.650 --> 01:16:48.450
But, but, but.

01:16:48.484 --> 01:16:49.318
What?

01:16:49.351 --> 01:16:50.853
Mom, you promised.

01:16:50.886 --> 01:16:53.355
I know I did, but
I tell you what.

01:16:53.389 --> 01:16:55.090
We can go somewhere
else and look,

01:16:55.124 --> 01:16:57.426
because I just don't
think this place

01:16:57.459 --> 01:16:59.461
has what we're
looking for, okay?

01:17:01.930 --> 01:17:03.532
Mommy, please?

01:17:03.565 --> 01:17:04.400
Honey.

01:17:05.501 --> 01:17:08.203
What about, what
about a stuffed animal?

01:17:08.237 --> 01:17:09.538
We have lots of those.

01:17:09.571 --> 01:17:10.372
You know what?

01:17:10.406 --> 01:17:11.607
I, I, excuse me.

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.076
Sir, I think we made a mistake.

01:17:14.109 --> 01:17:18.347
Well, I'm sure he'll
find something safe there.

01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:21.817
Oh, none of them
have stories, do they?

01:17:21.850 --> 01:17:25.387
I mean, like the
ones you told us.

01:17:26.922 --> 01:17:31.393
Yes, well, everything
in this, in this store,

01:17:31.427 --> 01:17:34.296
in this world has
a story to tell.

01:17:35.931 --> 01:17:38.634
He's a nice, nice boy.

01:17:38.667 --> 01:17:41.370
He deserves a nice safe home.

01:17:41.403 --> 01:17:42.371
Excuse me?

01:17:46.241 --> 01:17:47.543
What's his name?

01:17:47.576 --> 01:17:49.411
Well, he doesn't
have a name yet.

01:17:49.445 --> 01:17:51.146
You're gonna have
to give him one.

01:17:52.614 --> 01:17:55.584
Clowns have always
just made me afraid.

01:17:55.617 --> 01:17:57.953
Ever since that movie
The Poltergeist came out.

01:17:57.986 --> 01:18:02.792
Oh, that movie nearly killed
the clown doll business.

01:18:02.826 --> 01:18:04.993
I mean clowns are supposed
to make you happy,

01:18:05.027 --> 01:18:06.696
supposed to make you smile.

01:18:06.730 --> 01:18:09.965
Yeah, and so are leprechauns.

01:18:11.066 --> 01:18:11.900
Touche.

01:18:13.335 --> 01:18:15.437
He can stay in
my room with me.

01:18:15.471 --> 01:18:16.605
I think he'll like it.

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:20.342
Well, clowns are supposed
to be protectors of happiness,

01:18:21.745 --> 01:18:26.215
protectors of smiles,
protectors of good wishes.

01:18:27.717 --> 01:18:29.418
They don't like unhappiness.

01:18:31.353 --> 01:18:32.955
They'll do anything they can

01:18:32.988 --> 01:18:35.792
to protect them
from such things.

01:18:35.825 --> 01:18:37.626
Well, I guess we'll take him.

01:18:39.661 --> 01:18:40.864
Good.

01:18:40.896 --> 01:18:42.064
We'll be best friends.

01:18:42.097 --> 01:18:43.867
I'll name you Giggles.

01:18:43.899 --> 01:18:46.935
Giggles, that's
a perfect name.

01:18:46.969 --> 01:18:48.470
Now, I'll tell you what.

01:18:48.504 --> 01:18:52.107
Giggles would
normally sell for $30,

01:18:52.141 --> 01:18:54.943
but what's that?

01:18:56.478 --> 01:19:01.483
Uh huh, uh huh, well, Giggles
wants to be your friend,

01:19:02.317 --> 01:19:02.985
and he wants to protect you,

01:19:04.253 --> 01:19:08.825
so I will only sell him for $20.

01:19:08.858 --> 01:19:09.692
Okay.

01:19:11.828 --> 01:19:12.995
Thank you.

01:19:13.028 --> 01:19:15.564
Thank you, goodbye,
my little friend.

01:19:17.599 --> 01:19:21.103
Be safe, bye, Giggles.

01:19:31.714 --> 01:19:33.649
Dad!

01:19:33.683 --> 01:19:35.184
Oh, my God.

01:19:35.217 --> 01:19:36.485
That is it!

01:19:38.353 --> 01:19:39.555
What.

01:19:39.588 --> 01:19:41.523
I'm gonna teach that
kid some discipline.

01:19:43.091 --> 01:19:44.226
Tom, no!

01:19:45.561 --> 01:19:47.697
Sit your ass back down now.

01:19:57.506 --> 01:19:59.508
What the hell is it now?

01:20:02.344 --> 01:20:03.145
I...

01:20:03.178 --> 01:20:04.480
Yeah.

01:20:04.513 --> 01:20:06.114
I'm scared.

01:20:06.148 --> 01:20:06.982
Of what?

01:20:08.484 --> 01:20:12.454
Giggles told me there's
a monster in here.

01:20:12.488 --> 01:20:15.257
Really, well,
let's take a look.

01:20:20.562 --> 01:20:21.530
Nothing in there.

01:20:23.499 --> 01:20:27.035
It ah, doesn't look
like there's ah,

01:20:27.069 --> 01:20:28.370
anything over here either.

01:20:31.206 --> 01:20:34.176
Hey, where's the doll?

01:20:34.209 --> 01:20:36.411
Where's the God damn doll?

01:20:37.981 --> 01:20:39.414
What?

01:20:39.448 --> 01:20:42.685
The one your mom spent
$20 of my hard-earned money,

01:20:42.719 --> 01:20:45.120
so you wouldn't interrupt
us every damn night.

01:20:46.823 --> 01:20:48.090
Where is it?

01:20:48.123 --> 01:20:49.391
Under my bed.

01:20:50.292 --> 01:20:51.560
Under my bed.

01:20:52.695 --> 01:20:54.898
So, thought you'd
hide it from us, huh?

01:20:54.931 --> 01:20:57.432
I'm gonna take that sissy clown,

01:20:57.466 --> 01:21:00.068
and I'm gonna throw
it in the trash,

01:21:00.102 --> 01:21:02.805
and I'm gonna give you a good...

01:21:35.203 --> 01:21:36.039
Mom!
