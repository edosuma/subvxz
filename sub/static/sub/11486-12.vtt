WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:05.275
- What's that?
- My high school yearbook.

00:05.440 --> 00:08.159
Hey, do you remember a
girl named Jamie Eckelberry?

00:08.320 --> 00:09.992
- No.
- Yeah, sure you do.

00:10.160 --> 00:12.276
She used to hang out
at the house all the time.

00:12.440 --> 00:15.557
Oh, yeah. Eckelberry Hound.

00:16.440 --> 00:18.749
Not a name she was fond of.

00:18.960 --> 00:23.511
Hey, I didn't make it up.
I just spread it around. What about her?

00:23.680 --> 00:26.752
Oh, she called the alumni association
and tracked me down.

00:26.920 --> 00:30.629
How does that work? They let her
sniff one of your sweaters?

00:30.840 --> 00:34.389
She e-mailed me. She's in town
on business, and I invited her over.

00:34.600 --> 00:38.559
Great. I'll get out of your way.
Just keep her off the good rug.

00:38.760 --> 00:42.150
Very funny. No. For your
information, it's not a date.

00:42.320 --> 00:45.232
She's just a friend who has become
very successful in her field.

00:45.440 --> 00:49.433
Oh, that's nice that she
has a field to run around in.

00:50.640 --> 00:54.189
- It's getting old, Charlie.
- In people years or dog years?

00:55.440 --> 00:58.238
Sorry. Oh, look.
You remember Miss Hanrahan?

00:58.440 --> 01:02.513
- Sure. I had her for sophomore English.
- I had her in the teachers' lounge.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.549
Oh, that's Jamie. Be nice.

01:06.760 --> 01:09.672
I'm always nice. Ask Miss Hanrahan.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.030
- I'm serious.
- Relax. I'm just gonna say hello...

01:13.200 --> 01:15.760
...scratch her behind the ear,
and then I'm out of here.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.437
- You done with the dog jokes?
- Yes.

01:19.640 --> 01:22.677
- Good.
- I hope she looks fetching.

01:24.680 --> 01:27.797
Okay, I guess I had one more.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.756
- Alan.
- Jamie.

01:59.400 --> 02:03.678
Do you remember how Stuart Negelman
used to tell everybody you were gay?

02:03.880 --> 02:06.075
Don't remind me.
I had one Boy George album...

02:06.240 --> 02:09.073
...and suddenly
I'm queen of the fairies.

02:09.280 --> 02:11.669
You'll be happy to know
I ran into him in New York.

02:11.840 --> 02:15.037
- And? Knew it.
- Gay.

02:15.360 --> 02:17.476
Okay, here we go.

02:17.640 --> 02:21.349
Two margaritas,
and a rum and Diet Coke.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.590
- Thank you, Charlie.
- You're welcome.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.516
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

02:29.760 --> 02:34.311
So Stuart Negelman: Buttoned-down,
or singing show tunes on a float?

02:34.520 --> 02:37.114
Very macho. Owns a gym in SoHo.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.794
Speaking of which, you look
like you're in good shape.

02:39.960 --> 02:43.635
- I have kept up with the hacky sack.
- Good for you.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.951
And you. I cannot get over what
a beautiful woman you've become.

02:47.160 --> 02:51.631
- Oh, stop it. You're embarrassing me.
- Too bad. It's true.

02:56.520 --> 03:00.672
Charlie, that's lovely. You still play.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.552
Just professionally.

03:03.560 --> 03:07.519
- You became a musician?
- More a composer. Gotta pay the bills.

03:09.120 --> 03:12.157
Play the jingle you wrote for the
feminine deodorant commercial.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.597
Okay.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.949
<i>Fresh as a summer breeze</i>
<i>Clean as a mountain spring</i>

03:20.320 --> 03:23.517
No. You wrote that? I love that.

03:24.360 --> 03:26.920
Hey, hey, did I tell you
that I was voted...

03:27.080 --> 03:30.277
...Chiropractor of the Year by the San
Fernando Valley Chiropractic Association?

03:30.480 --> 03:33.199
Oh, that's fantastic, Alan.
You must be very proud.

03:33.400 --> 03:38.315
Well, it's not pride so much as the
satisfaction I get from helping people.

03:39.560 --> 03:42.870
<i>Carefree, so carefree</i>

03:43.080 --> 03:46.629
<i>What every woman wants to be</i>

03:49.240 --> 03:51.879
Hey. Hey, you know
what would be fun?

03:52.040 --> 03:55.112
A session of Dungeons & Dragons.
Like the old days, you know?

03:55.280 --> 03:59.239
- Just the two of us.
- Wow, I haven't played in years.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.715
Or we can go down to the beach
and go for a swim.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.798
- I didn't bring a suit.
- So my plan is working.

04:06.640 --> 04:10.155
You know, I think I'll take a rain check.
Do you mind if I use your restroom?

04:10.360 --> 04:11.839
Down the hall on the right.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.638
Thank you.

04:17.360 --> 04:19.396
Don't you have enough women?

04:19.880 --> 04:23.634
No. Anyway, you said she
was just an old friend.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.398
Well, that was before I saw her.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.994
Come on, I spent years
laying the groundwork for this.

04:28.200 --> 04:31.112
And yet you never erected
anything on the site.

04:31.320 --> 04:33.197
Because she didn't look like that then.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.197
Oh, shame on you, Alan Harper.

04:36.200 --> 04:39.237
Don't you know a woman is so much
more than what's on the outside?

04:39.440 --> 04:42.318
She's a mountain spring,
a summer breeze and I saw her first.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.432
What are you, 11?

04:44.640 --> 04:48.474
Come on. She's smart, she's beautiful,
she's the kind of woman who...

04:48.680 --> 04:50.875
- You could never get?
- Exactly.

04:53.680 --> 04:55.830
Well, if she's that important to you.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.871
She is, she is. Very much.

04:58.040 --> 05:00.156
- Okay, fine. I'm out of it.
- Really?

05:00.360 --> 05:01.839
Happy birthday.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.754
Isn't that presumptuous? You think you
can just give this woman as a gift?

05:05.920 --> 05:08.878
- Okay, forget it.
- No, no. Happy birthday to me.

05:09.960 --> 05:14.317
Listen, I have an early meeting in the
morning, so I should probably get going.

05:14.520 --> 05:18.115
Oh, no, no. The night is so young,
and Charlie was just leaving.

05:18.280 --> 05:21.158
Yeah, if I don't start drinking now,
I'll be up all night.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.798
I really have to get going.
What about dinner tomorrow night?

05:25.240 --> 05:27.117
- That would be great.
- Okay, terrific.

05:27.280 --> 05:29.236
Why don't the three of us
meet at 7?

05:29.640 --> 05:31.471
The... The three of us?

05:32.840 --> 05:35.274
Oh, gee. Tomorrow night? I can't.

05:35.480 --> 05:39.268
Oh, come on, Charlie.
I'm only in town for a few days.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.477
It wouldn't be the same
without you. Right, Alan?

05:42.640 --> 05:46.235
That's... That's true.
It would be different. But still good.

05:46.440 --> 05:49.113
No, no, no. You guys have
a lot of catching up to do.

05:49.320 --> 05:52.118
I insist. Charlie, you have to come.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.475
Well, if it's okay with Alan...

05:55.520 --> 05:57.750
Of course.

05:57.960 --> 06:01.794
Okay, great. Then I will
see you both tomorrow.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.313
- Okay.
- Thank you.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.789
- Can't wait.
- I know. Me too. Good night.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.393
Bye.

06:10.880 --> 06:14.236
So I'll get you something else
for your birthday.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.158
You like hookers?

06:16.840 --> 06:18.876
Charlie, we agreed you're out.
Now stay out.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.389
- All right, fine. I won't go.
- Thank you.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.551
Wait! If you don't come,
she'll think I told you not to come.

06:28.760 --> 06:30.034
There is that possibility.

06:30.360 --> 06:32.920
That's your plan. To make me
look petty and insecure.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.429
Alan, I don't have to plan for that.

06:35.760 --> 06:39.514
Let me tell you something. You're coming
with us, whether you like it or not.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.877
All right.

06:42.680 --> 06:44.750
Wait!

06:45.640 --> 06:47.835
- We should take your new Mercedes.
- Fine.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.759
- I should drive it so she thinks it's mine.
- Okay.

06:52.840 --> 06:54.671
Wait!

06:54.880 --> 06:57.189
She'll never believe
I drive a Mercedes.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.992
You'll drive my old Volvo
so that she thinks it's yours.

07:01.200 --> 07:05.751
Whatever. That just means you'll
be sitting in the backseat alone.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.912
Wait!

07:09.080 --> 07:13.278
Charlie, I can't believe that after
all these years, you're still single.

07:13.480 --> 07:14.959
Well...

07:19.000 --> 07:20.592
It's not that hard to believe.

07:20.760 --> 07:24.833
I'm a selfish, promiscuous,
commitment-phobic man.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.596
Alan, on the other hand, is a very
generous, loyal, one-woman kind of guy.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.713
Guilty.

07:34.600 --> 07:37.034
Why doesn't that surprise me?

07:37.200 --> 07:38.679
Now, what is surprising...

07:38.840 --> 07:42.913
...is to hear a man be so honest
and forthcoming about his flaws.

07:43.360 --> 07:47.512
Charlie, you are
a real breath of fresh air.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.551
Guilty.

07:52.520 --> 07:57.116
But if you really want a breath
of fresh air, take a lungful of Alan.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.797
He is a true gentleman.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.718
Oh, Alan's always been a gentleman.

08:03.880 --> 08:07.475
I remember one time we were kids. We
were in my bedroom playing Stratego...

08:07.640 --> 08:11.269
...and my blouse came unbuttoned,
and Alan, instead of sneaking a peek...

08:11.440 --> 08:17.276
...like a lot of guys would do, averted
his eyes and said, "Jamie, bosom."

08:17.800 --> 08:19.916
Really. Is that true, Alan?

08:20.120 --> 08:23.749
Pretty much. We were
playing Boggle, not Stratego.

08:23.960 --> 08:27.555
Well, there you go.
A gentleman. A better man than I.

08:27.760 --> 08:32.515
Oh, don't put yourself down, Charlie.
You seem like a wonderful man to me.

08:32.960 --> 08:36.794
Yeah, but you heard him. I'm better.

08:39.960 --> 08:41.996
Excuse me.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.959
I'll be right back.
I think he wants to talk.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.674
You know, you are such
a good brother.

08:51.880 --> 08:53.677
You have no idea.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.477
"Bosom"?

09:00.960 --> 09:02.791
Forget that.
What the hell are you doing?

09:02.960 --> 09:06.396
What? I'm trying to make you look
good. Turns out it's not that easy.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.269
You look like you're trying
to make me look good...

09:09.440 --> 09:11.078
...but you're making you look good.

09:11.240 --> 09:13.708
I don't know how,
but that's the net result.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.235
- Alan, you're being ridiculous.
- Am I? I think not.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.960
From the minute we walked in,
you've been sabotaging me.

09:19.160 --> 09:22.357
- How?
- How? Look at where I'm sitting.

09:22.560 --> 09:25.438
- What? You wanted to sit next to her.
- Yeah, and you let me.

09:26.920 --> 09:31.198
And now you get to stare into her eyes,
and I get to stare into her ear.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.070
What do you want from me?
Wanna change seats?

09:34.280 --> 09:35.838
Sure. That won't look suspicious.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.993
I'm just trying to help, Alan.
Well, how about that? I do have to pee.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.918
You wanna help me?
Stop talking me up.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.195
- It's killing me.
- Okay.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.829
Stop putting yourself down.
That's killing me too.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.679
- Got it.
- Just sit there and eat your dinner...

09:50.840 --> 09:52.114
...and I'll play your game.

09:52.280 --> 09:53.679
Fine.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.637
You wanna shake on it?

09:57.320 --> 09:59.311
You're disgusting.

09:59.520 --> 10:01.636
Yeah, I'm disgusting.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.678
At least I'm not the one
taking a squirt on my shoe.

10:08.080 --> 10:11.231
Let me tell you something
about my brother.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.949
He puts himself down,
but he is truly a wonderful man.

10:15.120 --> 10:19.955
I mean, here's a guy,
single, good-Iooking, talented...

10:20.120 --> 10:23.192
- Well, l...
- You're too modest.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.233
Talented, a ton of money.

10:26.400 --> 10:29.870
And what does he do when his brother
and nephew need a place to live?

10:30.040 --> 10:33.919
Does he complain about us
cramping his style? No.

10:34.080 --> 10:37.675
He opens up his home, and his heart.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.434
And frankly, I don't know
which one is bigger.

10:42.920 --> 10:46.435
You are an incredible human being.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.469
Can we get the damn check, please?

10:54.400 --> 10:57.278
Wait till you meet Jake.
He's a great kid.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.271
You're gonna love him. Right, Charlie?

10:59.480 --> 11:03.109
Don't oversell him, Alan.
He mostly sits around and eats.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.032
What do you guys like to do together?

11:05.240 --> 11:09.313
Oh, we do all kinds
of father-son things.

11:09.480 --> 11:14.270
- We go to the movies...
- Where he sits and eats.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.750
And we also build models...

11:18.480 --> 11:21.870
You know, airplanes, and
fly them off the deck.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.833
- That sounds like fun.
- Oh, it is. Jake loves it.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.877
I mean, he is a great kid.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.310
I can't wait to meet him.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.471
How about tomorrow afternoon?

11:31.640 --> 11:34.154
- Tomorrow sounds great.
- Good, good. It's a date.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.914
- So don't be late.
- Or we'll have to wait.

11:41.320 --> 11:43.311
Oh, okay. Here we are.

11:43.480 --> 11:47.234
Thank you so much.
I had a wonderful time.

11:48.800 --> 11:52.156
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good night.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.031
Good night, Charlie.

12:03.880 --> 12:05.359
Good night.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.830
To the Batcave, Alfred.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.753
Go to hell.

12:12.920 --> 12:15.832
I was just sitting here.
I didn't put her tongue in my mouth.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.513
You got tongue?

12:17.720 --> 12:20.314
Actually, looking back,
it was probably mine.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.076
Oh, relax. I'm just screwing with you.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.071
Besides, you're the one
who got the date.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.834
You had to pimp your kid
out to do it, but you got there.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.191
Hey, hey, there is nothing wrong
with bragging on my son.

12:31.360 --> 12:34.193
He's a reflection of me,
and if that compensates...

12:34.360 --> 12:36.476
...for some of my social clumsiness...

12:36.680 --> 12:39.274
And maybe rustles up a little tail.

12:39.440 --> 12:40.998
I am not pimping him out.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.958
Don't bark at me. I'm proud of you.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.632
Thank you. And make yourself
scarce tomorrow.

12:47.800 --> 12:51.349
- I don't need any more of your help.
- Fine. You're on your own.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.239
Now, hush up and drive
Miss Daisy home.

12:55.120 --> 12:57.873
Okay, Sky Captain. Ready to go?

12:58.040 --> 12:59.393
I guess.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.198
See how he loves this?

13:02.640 --> 13:04.551
Pilot to copilot. Contact.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.639
What?

13:07.680 --> 13:10.911
- Contact.
- Why are you talking like that?

13:12.160 --> 13:14.515
Just... Just start the engine.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.635
Here we go. Ready for liftoff?

13:17.800 --> 13:19.916
It's not a rocket ship, Dad.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.469
I know that, Jake.

13:25.440 --> 13:27.749
Hey, it actually works.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.638
Bring it up. Bring it up.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.870
- Okay.
- Come on, Jake, up, up. It's...

13:32.040 --> 13:33.439
- Don't yell.
- Give me that.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.272
- No, I'm doing it.
- Well, then do it.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.152
I am.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.837
Is that it?

13:43.720 --> 13:46.951
No, go get it, and we'll patch
her back up, like we always do.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.152
Can we just order
a pizza and watch TV?

13:50.360 --> 13:51.873
Go get the plane.

13:53.240 --> 13:54.878
This sucks.

13:56.360 --> 13:59.272
"This sucks." Isn't he a hoot?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.831
He's great.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.750
So...

14:05.920 --> 14:08.150
...here we are.

14:08.320 --> 14:09.912
Yep.

14:11.360 --> 14:15.114
I just cannot get over
how much you've changed.

14:15.560 --> 14:19.997
- You like?
- Yeah, me like. I mean... I mean, I like.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.439
So...

14:23.440 --> 14:25.158
...where's Charlie?

14:26.520 --> 14:28.238
This is all I could find.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.070
- Guess who that is.
- No way.

14:33.240 --> 14:36.596
- Way.
- What was going on with your hair?

14:37.720 --> 14:39.472
It's called a Jeri curl.

14:40.640 --> 14:43.279
It was my Michael Jackson period.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.198
Who's the tall guy next to you?

14:45.360 --> 14:47.396
Oh, that's me, Jake.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.315
Oh, sorry.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.516
Well, at least you look like a girl now.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.758
Thank you.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.912
Was Dad your boyfriend?

14:58.080 --> 15:00.150
Oh, no, no.
Jamie and I were just friends.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.954
Yeah, we were never that way.

15:03.160 --> 15:05.196
Are you that way now?

15:06.200 --> 15:09.556
- Why don't you go watch TV?
- Finally.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.358
You know, Jamie, I've been thinking.

15:16.520 --> 15:19.830
You're single. I'm single.
Well, we have an awful lot in common.

15:20.040 --> 15:23.874
I mean, there's no reason
we couldn't try to be...

15:24.040 --> 15:26.679
...you know, more than friends.

15:26.880 --> 15:28.598
Is that something you'd want?

15:28.800 --> 15:30.677
Well...

15:31.440 --> 15:34.955
- Hey.
- Oh, darn.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.834
- Sorry to intrude.
- That's okay. It's good to see you.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.513
I thought you were gonna be busy.

15:39.720 --> 15:42.871
I was. I went to a movie,
shot some pool...

15:43.040 --> 15:47.431
...bought a book, bought a shirt, drank
a bucket of coffee, read the book.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.440
And then it occurred to me:
"Hey, I have a home."

15:52.400 --> 15:54.595
Hey, Dad, can you microwave
some popcorn for me?

15:55.080 --> 15:58.709
- Why can't you make it for yourself?
- Remember what happened last time?

15:58.880 --> 16:01.519
You're old enough to make
popcorn without starting a fire.

16:02.120 --> 16:03.678
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.757
I'll be right back.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.555
So Jake's a great kid, isn't he?

16:13.080 --> 16:14.638
Yeah, I suppose.

16:14.800 --> 16:18.395
I would never say this to Alan, but I
don't really care much for children.

16:20.720 --> 16:25.077
Well, the truth is, Alan's
not too fond of him either.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.429
He feeds the kid and keeps
a roof over his head...

16:29.600 --> 16:31.909
...but there's no
love lost between them.

16:33.800 --> 16:37.190
- Charlie, give it a rest.
- Sorry?

16:37.560 --> 16:39.232
Why do you push me towards Alan...

16:39.400 --> 16:41.550
...when it's obvious
how much you want me?

16:43.560 --> 16:45.790
He's got a birthday coming up.

16:48.560 --> 16:51.438
Just tell me you want me.

16:52.320 --> 16:54.834
Go ahead, Charlie. Tell her.

16:55.040 --> 16:59.431
What? No, no. You two, with the
Dungeons, the Dragons, the Boggle.

16:59.600 --> 17:00.953
You should be together.

17:01.160 --> 17:04.596
Clearly she wants you, so let's be
grown-up, and I'll get out of the way...

17:04.760 --> 17:06.954
...so the two pretty people can mate.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.511
No, no, no, no.
You laid the foundation...

17:09.680 --> 17:12.478
...and you should, you know,
lay the rest of it.

17:12.680 --> 17:15.911
I appreciate what you're trying to do,
but I am stepping aside...

17:16.119 --> 17:18.190
- No, no. I'm stepping aside.
- No, no. I am.

17:18.359 --> 17:20.476
No, no, I'll step aside.
I will clear the way.

17:20.640 --> 17:24.155
Will you both just shut up?
You're ruining everything.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.554
- Nice going.
- Nice going.

17:27.720 --> 17:30.632
- Say it, Charlie.
- Say what?

17:30.840 --> 17:36.551
Say that slick, cool, Charlie Harper
finally wants Eckelberry Hound.

17:40.160 --> 17:44.233
- You knew about that name?
- That name scarred me for life.

17:44.400 --> 17:47.710
It's the reason I haven't eaten
a carbohydrate since college.

17:48.480 --> 17:51.119
- Well, you do look good.
- You're damn right I look good...

17:51.280 --> 17:53.350
...you smug, shallow son of a bitch.

17:53.520 --> 17:56.910
I have spent years working
and sweating and dreaming...

17:57.080 --> 18:00.868
...about the day that I would be
able to rub your smarmy nose in it.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.196
Okay, I'm getting mixed signals here.

18:04.960 --> 18:09.397
This is the signal, Charlie:
You can't have this.

18:09.560 --> 18:14.315
Not now, not ever.
Never, never, never!

18:15.080 --> 18:17.640
You know, I didn't make up
the Eckelberry Hound thing.

18:17.840 --> 18:20.752
But he did spread it around.
I was always your friend.

18:20.960 --> 18:24.157
Oh, please. I spent years
throwing myself at you, friend.

18:24.320 --> 18:27.392
Playing stupid nerd games
on my bed with my shirt open, buddy.

18:27.560 --> 18:29.596
Hoping that you would
kiss me or touch me...

18:29.760 --> 18:31.990
...or at least notice me
as a woman, pal!

18:33.320 --> 18:36.471
- You knew your shirt was open?
- Who do you think opened it?

18:40.160 --> 18:43.869
But I wasn't pretty enough for you.
You wanted Donna DeMarco...

18:44.040 --> 18:47.077
...or Maxine Chernikoff,
just because they had big boobs...

18:47.240 --> 18:49.231
...and no excess facial hair.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.390
Oh, yeah. Donna DeMarco,
old Double D.

18:55.480 --> 18:58.074
Jamie, I had no idea. I am so sorry.

18:58.240 --> 19:02.995
But I was a stupid teenager.
I guess I just didn't appreciate you then.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.713
I guess not.

19:04.920 --> 19:09.550
But that was a long time ago.
I'm not a stupid teenager anymore.

19:09.720 --> 19:13.235
Do you think maybe you could forgive
me, and maybe we could try again?

19:14.120 --> 19:16.395
Is that what you really want, Alan?

19:16.840 --> 19:18.319
Very much.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.598
Well, eat your heart out.

19:22.760 --> 19:27.675
You can never have this.
Never, never, never!

19:39.920 --> 19:42.514
Well, I guess we know
why she's still single.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.478
You're right, Dad. This is fun.

19:49.640 --> 19:52.518
Told you. It just takes a little
while to get the hang of it.

19:52.680 --> 19:54.591
See if I can bring it in for a landing.

19:54.760 --> 19:58.548
Probably not a good idea.
There's no real place to put it.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.514
What do you think Donna DeMarco's
doing these days?

20:33.600 --> 20:35.591
