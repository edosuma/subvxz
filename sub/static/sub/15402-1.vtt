01:18.323 --> 01:20.791
This is Operation Experiment.

01:20.959 --> 01:24.486
A secret base far north of the Arctic Circle.

01:24.663 --> 01:29.259
Experiment was the code name for this
top-priority scientific expedition.

01:29.434 --> 01:32.631
These men arrived here on X-day minus 60.

01:32.804 --> 01:35.796
It has taken them the full
two months to get ready.

01:35.974 --> 01:38.204
Today is X-day.

01:38.377 --> 01:41.608
It is now H-hour minus 59 minutes.

01:41.780 --> 01:44.146
There is less than an hour left.

01:48.420 --> 01:53.084
The plane must arrive at its rendezvous
200 miles away in exactly 58 minutes.

01:53.258 --> 01:58.355
There can be no margin for error.
There can be no second chance.

01:58.530 --> 02:02.125
This is the rendezvous. The forward
observation post where scientists...

02:02.300 --> 02:06.896
...and their aides double-check equipment
and wait for the plane's approach.

02:07.072 --> 02:10.598
It is now H-hour minus 81 seconds.

02:10.776 --> 02:14.974
At H-hour minus 75 seconds,
the radar antenna flashes the word.

02:15.147 --> 02:18.378
There it is! Azimuth: 63 degrees.

02:18.550 --> 02:22.316
Airplane sighted: 13 hours, 11 minutes.

02:22.921 --> 02:29.053
Azimuth: 63 degrees.
Speed: Approximately 350 miles per hour.

02:29.227 --> 02:33.891
Professor Tom Nesbitt and Col. John Evans,
military liaison, tensely wait.

02:34.066 --> 02:37.263
The timing is perfect, thus far.

02:38.036 --> 02:40.630
It is now H-hour minus 56 seconds.

02:41.073 --> 02:46.204
Every man here knows his job.
He does it quickly, efficiently, silently.

02:46.378 --> 02:48.903
The men are ready.
The equipment is ready.

02:49.081 --> 02:52.380
It is now H-hour minus 52 seconds.

02:52.551 --> 02:56.317
Operation Experiment to Y-3-4-7.

02:56.488 --> 03:00.925
Operation Experiment to Y-3-4-7.
Over.

03:01.093 --> 03:05.826
Y-3-4-7 to Operation Experiment.
Now leveling off.

03:05.997 --> 03:09.899
Ground speed: 360.
Approaching IP.

03:10.068 --> 03:11.763
IP means initial point.

03:12.170 --> 03:16.766
The next 26 seconds will determine whether
these men have succeeded or failed.

03:16.942 --> 03:18.842
Now we count the seconds.

03:23.048 --> 03:28.384
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

03:28.920 --> 03:34.984
...five, four, three, two, one.

04:26.011 --> 04:28.275
Charlie, look!

04:32.384 --> 04:35.478
Col. Evans, there's something
strange on the radar screen.

04:40.525 --> 04:44.256
- What's the matter, Charlie?
- Right here, sir. A foreign object.

04:48.300 --> 04:51.201
- It's gone.
- What's gone?

04:51.369 --> 04:54.566
- I don't know, sir.
- It silhouetted like 500 tons, at least.

04:54.739 --> 04:57.936
- Where is it, then?
- I don't know, sir.

05:05.150 --> 05:08.313
- Are you sure we saw it?
- We saw something.

05:08.486 --> 05:13.685
Maybe the shock tossed something in front
of the antenna. That must have been it.

05:27.205 --> 05:30.299
Eight weeks of preparation,
and it's all over in a second.

05:30.475 --> 05:34.571
Jack, when energy of that magnitude
is released, it's never over.

05:34.746 --> 05:38.648
What the cumulative effects of these
atomic explosions and tests will be...

05:38.817 --> 05:43.117
...only time can tell.
- You mean scientists can't tell?

05:43.922 --> 05:46.356
The world's been here for millions of years.

05:46.524 --> 05:49.516
Man's been walking upright for
a comparatively short time.

05:49.694 --> 05:51.559
Mentally, we're still crawling.

05:51.730 --> 05:55.131
This test will add to our knowledge.
Wouldn't you say so, Ritchie?

05:55.300 --> 05:56.699
That's right.

05:56.868 --> 05:58.460
Every time one of these goes off...

05:58.637 --> 06:02.300
...I feel we're helping to write
the first chapter of a new Genesis.

06:02.474 --> 06:06.342
Let's hope we don't find ourselves writing
the last chapter of the old one.

06:06.511 --> 06:10.572
- You sound like a man who's scared, Tom.
- What makes you think I'm not?

06:11.616 --> 06:13.550
Here are the figures, Tom.

06:15.520 --> 06:18.318
We'll leave for the observation
post in about an hour.

06:18.490 --> 06:20.219
- Good. Loomis?
- Yes, sir?

06:20.392 --> 06:22.189
- Get the equipment ready.
- Yes, sir.

06:22.360 --> 06:26.626
You gentlemen. The moment your Geiger
counters indicate heavy radiation, turn back.

06:26.798 --> 06:31.064
Turn back? Colonel, we'll run back.
There isn't a hero in the crowd.

06:44.582 --> 06:46.846
Post 16.

07:16.581 --> 07:19.049
Shall we try to go around, sir?

07:19.217 --> 07:22.584
No, wait here for us.
We'll go up on foot.

08:20.178 --> 08:24.774
- What's your reading?
- 19.7. We'd better get out.

08:25.750 --> 08:29.686
I'll check post 17. You take 18,
and I'll meet you back here.

08:29.854 --> 08:31.583
Make it fast.

08:40.065 --> 08:42.090
Sgt. Willistead.

08:42.467 --> 08:43.866
What?

08:44.102 --> 08:46.297
But they've gone on foot.

08:46.571 --> 08:48.198
Okay.

08:49.007 --> 08:52.738
What's the matter?
There's a blizzard coming up!

09:27.312 --> 09:29.075
Tom!

09:29.247 --> 09:31.943
Tom! Tom!

09:32.917 --> 09:34.077
Tom!

12:10.608 --> 12:12.735
Tom!

12:18.316 --> 12:22.946
Tom, I can't move.
Something's wrong with my leg.

12:23.755 --> 12:25.780
I'm coming down.

12:38.870 --> 12:43.637
- Have they reported back yet?
- No, not yet. We're waiting.

13:05.096 --> 13:09.533
Tom, Tom! Get out, Tom!
A monster!

13:09.701 --> 13:13.797
- A prehistoric monster!
- Quiet, quiet. Don't struggle.

13:24.115 --> 13:27.710
I'll get you out, George.
Don't worry.

14:57.208 --> 15:00.871
Doc! Hey, doc!

15:08.019 --> 15:09.884
Put him right over here.

15:17.562 --> 15:20.030
- Give me my bag.
- Yes, sir.

15:29.740 --> 15:32.402
And get some blankets
off those other beds.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.313
How is he?

15:40.084 --> 15:42.609
- Where's Professor Ritchie?
- Still missing, sir.

15:42.787 --> 15:44.015
- What happened?
- We don't know.

15:44.188 --> 15:47.680
We saw the flares and rushed to post 18.
The whole shore was breaking loose.

15:47.859 --> 15:50.384
- We grabbed Nesbitt just in time.
- We never found Ritchie.

15:50.561 --> 15:53.257
Colonel, we have to get Nesbitt
to a hospital in the States.

15:53.431 --> 15:55.729
- He's in a bad way.
- Right.

15:56.968 --> 15:59.436
Get word to the main base.
We want a plane right away.

15:59.604 --> 16:05.042
Ritchie, I'll get you out.
I'll get you out.

16:06.477 --> 16:10.641
The monster...
Hurry, it's coming!

16:10.815 --> 16:15.309
Watch out, the monster!
The monster!

17:09.540 --> 17:12.167
Hello, Professor Nesbitt.
How do you feel today?

17:12.343 --> 17:16.279
Fine. Where is Col. Evans?
Did you reach Col. Evans?

17:16.446 --> 17:19.848
He'll be here any minute now.
I'd like you to meet Dr. Ingersol.

17:20.017 --> 17:23.919
He wants to ask you a few questions, if you
don't think it would be too hard on you.

17:24.088 --> 17:27.022
- Questions?
- I'm a psychiatrist, Professor Nesbitt.

17:27.191 --> 17:29.819
I thought together we might
get to the bottom of this.

17:29.994 --> 17:34.397
You think I'm crazy too.
My story may sound fantastic, but...

17:34.565 --> 17:38.023
Throughout history, people have claimed
that they've seen monsters.

17:38.202 --> 17:41.763
There was the famous Loch Lomond
monster, you'll probably recall.

17:41.939 --> 17:45.431
Then the green serpents
off the shores of Ireland.

17:45.610 --> 17:48.773
But not one of them was ever caught
or even photographed.

17:48.946 --> 17:52.939
I'm not inclined to let my imagination
run away with me. I'm a scientist.

17:53.117 --> 17:54.106
All right.

17:54.285 --> 17:57.083
Then it shouldn't be inconceivable to you...

17:57.254 --> 18:00.553
...that the mind can withstand
just so much pressure.

18:00.725 --> 18:03.990
The shock of seeing your friend dead,
your own predicament...

18:04.161 --> 18:09.064
...was too much to bear. So that you
momentarily lost contact with reality.

18:09.233 --> 18:12.532
It's a phenomenon which was
not uncommon during the war.

18:12.703 --> 18:16.036
But Ritchie wasn't dead when
I got to him. He tried to warn me.

18:16.207 --> 18:19.335
Two people don't share
the same hallucination.

18:22.279 --> 18:23.746
Hello, Tom. How are you?

18:24.348 --> 18:26.543
- Thawed out?
- Jack, I'm glad you're here.

18:26.717 --> 18:29.618
I'm having a hard time convincing
them that I'm not an idiot.

18:29.787 --> 18:31.948
I was in Washington making my report.
I was...

18:32.123 --> 18:36.219
What did they say about the animal? I want
to be in on any expedition going after him.

18:36.394 --> 18:38.862
Tom, I didn't tell them about the animal.

18:39.697 --> 18:41.790
Why not?
It should've been in the report.

18:41.966 --> 18:46.801
I went back to Post 18. I tried
to reconstruct what happened out there.

18:47.138 --> 18:50.972
I couldn't find a thing.
No tracks. Nothing.

18:52.276 --> 18:53.834
Nothing?

18:54.011 --> 18:57.276
I'm sorry. I wish
I could say I saw something.

18:57.548 --> 18:59.106
The blizzard.

18:59.517 --> 19:01.382
There was a blizzard, remember?

19:01.552 --> 19:04.783
The snow must have blown over
and covered everything.

19:04.955 --> 19:07.389
- Check me out of here.
- You are in no condition to leave.

19:07.558 --> 19:09.719
It's imperative that you have rest.

19:09.894 --> 19:13.022
- How can I rest?
- I've encountered this sort of thing before.

19:13.197 --> 19:17.031
You've undergone a tremendous shock.
You've got to stay in bed.

19:17.201 --> 19:20.534
I see. And that makes it official?

19:20.705 --> 19:22.229
I'm afraid it does.

19:22.406 --> 19:26.308
So long. You do what the doctor says. We'll
get together when you're on your feet.

19:26.477 --> 19:28.945
That won't be too long.

19:32.049 --> 19:35.280
What about that sound I heard?

19:35.519 --> 19:40.513
In your condition, it could have been
anything. The wind. Anything.

19:51.035 --> 19:54.869
No wind ever made a sound like that.

20:33.844 --> 20:35.903
Captain. Captain!

20:36.080 --> 20:38.344
Are you daft, man?

21:24.795 --> 21:27.889
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

21:31.168 --> 21:33.830
What's going on
in our turbulent world today?

21:34.004 --> 21:39.169
Oh, death and politics. The comic page
is the only thing that makes sense anymore.

21:39.343 --> 21:43.040
I take it, then, that you advise
a dose of it after each meal?

21:43.214 --> 21:48.083
- You quote me exactly.
- Then I'm gonna take your advice exactly.

21:48.252 --> 21:50.277
Here it is.

21:56.327 --> 21:57.726
Say.

21:58.562 --> 22:00.689
Look at this!

22:14.912 --> 22:19.406
That item is right where it belongs.
On the comic page.

22:47.511 --> 22:49.809
And that's why I came here, Dr. Elson.

22:49.980 --> 22:52.540
I felt if you heard my story,
you'd do something.

22:52.716 --> 22:55.014
And what is it you think I can do?

22:55.185 --> 22:58.279
Fit out an expedition,
institute a search.

22:58.455 --> 23:02.619
The fitting out of an expedition requires
a great deal of attention to detail.

23:02.793 --> 23:05.489
Such as time, personnel, money.

23:05.663 --> 23:08.962
How can you talk about details
in the face of such a discovery?

23:09.133 --> 23:13.661
I'm not a paleontologist, and I have
a desire to know more about this animal.

23:13.837 --> 23:16.362
I thought you'd have
such a compelling curiosity...

23:16.540 --> 23:19.373
...that nothing would stand in your way.

23:19.543 --> 23:22.740
Professor Nesbitt,
after waiting for 30 years...

23:22.913 --> 23:26.371
...l'm about to undertake
my first extended holiday.

23:26.550 --> 23:29.542
I would throw aside my plans
if I thought there was...

23:29.720 --> 23:33.520
...the slightest chance of what your
saying being possible. It isn't.

23:33.691 --> 23:36.251
What about that newspaper item?

23:36.427 --> 23:40.557
If all the items of seamen reporting
monsters were placed end on end...

23:40.731 --> 23:42.722
...it'd reach to the moon, my boy.

23:42.900 --> 23:44.595
You mean, I'm wasting your time?

23:44.768 --> 23:46.929
Do you realize
you're asking me to believe...

23:47.104 --> 23:52.371
...you saw a creature that would be
over 100 million years old?

23:52.643 --> 23:57.580
But you said that 100 million years ago, the
water of the Mesozoic age turned to ice.

23:57.748 --> 24:01.047
Isn't it possible that an animal
was trapped in that ice?

24:01.218 --> 24:04.119
Caught in the freezing temperatures
and locked in.

24:04.455 --> 24:08.186
Then when we released the bomb,
the heat generated melted the ice...

24:08.359 --> 24:11.726
...in which this beast was imprisoned
and freed it?

24:11.895 --> 24:15.296
Bringing it back to life
after 100 million years?

24:15.666 --> 24:18.191
Couldn't it have been
in a state of hibernation?

24:18.369 --> 24:21.304
Bears live through winters
under similar conditions.

24:21.472 --> 24:22.837
That's quite true.

24:23.007 --> 24:28.502
A bear does live off itself for one winter
from food accumulated within itself...

24:28.679 --> 24:33.048
...but it's hard to believe an animal could
live for 100 million years off its own tissue.

24:33.617 --> 24:39.078
To put it mildly, it would require
quite an appetite, don't you think?

24:39.456 --> 24:43.187
I don't know if this will be of any help,
but you remember, doctor...

24:43.360 --> 24:47.922
...a few years ago, an expedition unearthed
a herd of mastodons in the Siberian tundra.

24:48.098 --> 24:53.627
Dead thousands of years, yet their fur
was still intact, the meat still edible.

24:53.804 --> 24:58.332
That's quite right, my dear Lee.
But they weren't alive.

24:58.509 --> 25:01.876
That's the important difference.
They weren't alive.

25:02.046 --> 25:08.508
I'm sorry, professor, but in all honesty,
I can't support your story.

25:11.155 --> 25:14.352
I guess I'll go back to the hospital.

25:15.926 --> 25:19.362
Maybe I should ask for a transfer
to the psychopathic ward.

25:19.530 --> 25:22.328
Nonsense.
It's not as bad as all that, my boy.

25:22.499 --> 25:25.332
Thanks for listening, doctor.

25:28.939 --> 25:31.703
When he first came to this country,
I attended his lectures...

25:31.875 --> 25:36.437
...on the curative properties of the
radioactive isotope. He is a brilliant man.

25:36.613 --> 25:39.776
Isn't his story in any way feasible?

25:39.950 --> 25:44.319
No. And I'm sorry.
I'd rather like to help him.

25:47.491 --> 25:51.393
I thought that little jaunt of yours last week
would knock you for a loop.

25:51.562 --> 25:53.757
I can't find anything wrong with you.

25:53.931 --> 25:56.491
I feel fine.
When do you think I can leave?

25:56.667 --> 25:58.567
Any time's all right with us.

25:58.735 --> 26:02.694
Don't go rushing to the North Pole again.
Keep fit and warm.

26:02.873 --> 26:04.431
Take those vitamins I gave you.

26:04.608 --> 26:06.371
This is your hour of mirth and melody.

26:06.543 --> 26:09.603
They say music has charms
to soothe the savage beast.

26:09.780 --> 26:12.374
They ought to try it
on these sea monsters.

26:12.549 --> 26:14.847
From Canada comes word
of a second ship...

26:15.018 --> 26:17.885
...destroyed by an enormous beast
according to Captain LeMay.

26:18.055 --> 26:22.253
He really ought to stop smoking that stuff
and try Virginia Golds, because...

26:29.833 --> 26:32.097
It shouldn't take me too long
to catch up.

26:32.269 --> 26:36.171
- It's good to have you back.
- Thank you.

26:39.009 --> 26:40.840
Anything else, Miss Ryan?

26:41.011 --> 26:44.276
Oh, yes. There's Miss Lee Hunter
waiting to see you.

26:44.448 --> 26:47.645
- Miss Lee Hunter?
- She's very pretty.

26:47.818 --> 26:49.843
Send her in.

26:55.559 --> 26:58.528
- How are you?
- Fine.

26:58.695 --> 27:01.459
We met at the university.
I'm Dr. Elson's assistant.

27:01.632 --> 27:04.192
Oh, yes, of course.

27:04.368 --> 27:08.270
The verdict: A prehistoric animal
would be presumptuous to be alive today...

27:08.438 --> 27:10.770
...and upset your neatly
cataloged theories.

27:10.941 --> 27:13.808
I see you don't remember
I was a sympathetic bystander.

27:13.977 --> 27:15.945
Oh, really? How come?

27:16.113 --> 27:22.052
I have a deep, abiding faith in the work
of scientists. Otherwise I wouldn't be one.

27:22.219 --> 27:24.346
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

27:24.521 --> 27:28.514
Sorry I can't offer you anything,
but everything around here is radioactive.

27:28.692 --> 27:30.785
No, thank you, anyway.

27:30.961 --> 27:32.451
When I was in the lab yesterday...

27:32.629 --> 27:36.998
...I heard a report about a man who claimed
that his ship was sunk by a sea monster.

27:37.167 --> 27:41.467
"If all the stories about sea monsters were
laid end to end, they'd reach the moon."

27:42.372 --> 27:45.102
But two reports coming so close together...

27:45.309 --> 27:49.405
What makes you think two are going to
convince anybody any more than one did?

27:49.580 --> 27:51.013
Well, it convinced me.

27:51.181 --> 27:54.617
It got me to thinking
it would be worthwhile investigating.

27:54.785 --> 28:00.917
I've gathered all the sketches of the known
prehistoric animals. If you could identify...

28:01.091 --> 28:04.083
Being considered crazy
has been quite an experience.

28:04.261 --> 28:07.162
However, I wouldn't care
to go through it again.

28:07.598 --> 28:11.932
Is this the man with the compelling
curiosity? Afraid of ridicule?

28:12.102 --> 28:14.502
- I'm not afraid of ridicule.
- No?

28:14.671 --> 28:17.435
But I'm afraid that's what it sounds like.

28:18.175 --> 28:24.045
You said sketches of all the known animals?
What if it's an unknown one?

28:24.214 --> 28:25.647
That's possible.

28:25.816 --> 28:28.808
But we'll never really know
unless you look at them.

28:29.019 --> 28:32.648
Oh, professor, think what it would mean
if you were right.

28:45.502 --> 28:48.471
Five-minute break. It's coffee time.

28:48.639 --> 28:51.369
Good. I need it.

28:54.211 --> 28:56.338
Cream and sugar?

28:56.980 --> 29:01.314
Better take both. I make coffee
strong enough to enter the Olympics.

29:01.485 --> 29:03.476
- One or two?
- Two, please.

29:03.654 --> 29:06.623
I never knew there were
so many prehistoric animals.

29:06.790 --> 29:09.623
We haven't even reached
the Cretaceous Period yet.

29:09.793 --> 29:14.230
I don't know if I could identify the beast
now if it looked through the window.

29:14.398 --> 29:17.026
Maybe it's part imagination, after all.

29:17.200 --> 29:21.864
Something I used to dream about
when I was a kid. Or read in fairy tales.

29:22.039 --> 29:27.477
You're tired. Why don't you just relax
for a moment. Have a sandwich.

29:28.078 --> 29:29.943
Thanks.

29:35.786 --> 29:38.152
- Funny.
- What's funny?

29:38.322 --> 29:41.450
Well, a girl like you, a paleontologist.

29:41.658 --> 29:44.058
What's wrong with paleontology?

29:44.227 --> 29:48.220
- Classifying old bones.
- Old bones?!

29:48.398 --> 29:51.834
If we didn't study the past,
you wouldn't know about the atom.

29:52.002 --> 29:55.233
Dr. Elson says, "Future
is the reflection of the past."

29:55.472 --> 29:59.203
You're fond of Dr. Elson, aren't you?
How did you become his assistant?

30:00.210 --> 30:04.544
I suppose by continually antagonizing him.
I was one of his students.

30:04.715 --> 30:08.481
To hear him tell it, all I ever did
was challenge him or argue with him.

30:08.652 --> 30:10.643
I was afraid he was going to expel me.

30:10.821 --> 30:13.949
Instead, he asked me to be
his assistant after I graduated.

30:14.124 --> 30:16.991
So I graduated, and here I am.

30:17.160 --> 30:18.559
And here I am.

30:18.729 --> 30:22.665
Between us, we span the ages.
You deal with the past, I with the future.

30:23.233 --> 30:25.701
How uncomplicated the past was.

30:26.970 --> 30:29.666
And how bright the future can be.

30:38.982 --> 30:41.780
Let's get back to the present.

31:04.040 --> 31:06.440
This might be it.

31:07.277 --> 31:09.040
I'm not sure.

31:09.212 --> 31:10.577
Not sure?

31:10.747 --> 31:14.979
The head looks similar,
but the front legs are too short.

31:15.152 --> 31:17.245
Wait a minute.

31:18.889 --> 31:21.255
Is this any better?

31:21.925 --> 31:24.587
Now, that's much more like it.

31:27.664 --> 31:30.224
And what about this one?

31:30.867 --> 31:33.358
That's the closest!

31:34.104 --> 31:36.231
I think that is it.

31:36.506 --> 31:39.304
Lee, I think that's the one I saw!

31:39.476 --> 31:42.206
If two independent observers
saw the same thing...

31:42.379 --> 31:46.247
If that captain in Canada
could identify the same sketch...

31:46.416 --> 31:49.180
And tell his story to Dr. Elson.

31:54.624 --> 31:58.082
"Capt. George LeMay,
Marquette, Canada"

32:01.064 --> 32:04.227
- Operator.
- I want to make a long-distance call, please.

32:04.401 --> 32:05.834
Person-to-person.

32:06.002 --> 32:10.371
To Capt. George LeMay,
Marquette, Canada.

32:10.540 --> 32:12.337
One moment, please.

32:12.509 --> 32:15.774
- Charge this call to Circle 44771.
- Thank you.

32:15.946 --> 32:17.914
It's my monster.

32:35.699 --> 32:37.633
They're speaking French.

32:37.801 --> 32:41.032
- Capt. LeMay is ready.
- Thank you.

32:42.172 --> 32:45.733
Hello. Capt. LeMay?

32:45.909 --> 32:50.209
My name is Tom Nesbitt.
I'm a scientist in New York.

32:50.380 --> 32:52.940
I have some important questions
to ask you.

32:53.116 --> 32:56.381
I don't speak English.

33:17.974 --> 33:19.407
Captain?

33:19.910 --> 33:23.971
- Hello. Capt. LeMay?
- I am sorry, but the captain has hung up.

33:24.147 --> 33:27.981
He is unhappy when anybody mentions
his accident, because everyone laughs.

33:28.151 --> 33:31.780
Please get the captain back.
I can't tell you how important this is.

33:31.955 --> 33:34.924
I am sorry. He will not
speak to you again, I'm sure.

33:35.091 --> 33:40.529
He is a stubborn old man. Perhaps a little
crazy. Especially on the subject of serpents.

33:44.467 --> 33:46.799
They think he is crazy too.

33:46.970 --> 33:51.339
- Well, it was a good try anyway.
- But good tries don't pay off.

33:51.508 --> 33:53.669
Do you suppose if you went up there...

33:53.843 --> 33:56.835
...you could make him understand
how important this is?

33:57.013 --> 33:59.311
I could get a plane.

33:59.482 --> 34:02.178
Phone me if anything exciting happens.

34:02.352 --> 34:05.549
I'll phone you even if nothing happens.

34:22.272 --> 34:24.831
You missed him
by not more than two hours.

34:25.007 --> 34:29.411
I thought you might be able to tell me
where he went. His housekeeper wouldn't.

34:29.579 --> 34:33.447
Capt. LeMay has been very touchy
since the sea serpent incident.

34:33.617 --> 34:39.021
People felt he was a bit balmy.
They laughed at him. Too bad too.

34:39.188 --> 34:41.918
The man had served well
and faithfully for years.

34:42.092 --> 34:46.426
I believe a man has a right to a few nips
now and then, I always say.

34:46.596 --> 34:50.429
- You don't believe his story?
- I said he was balmy, not me.

34:50.600 --> 34:53.797
He let it get out that he was headed
for the interior of Canada...

34:53.969 --> 34:59.135
...and was not going to stop until he hit
a spot that was uninhabited by white men.

34:59.309 --> 35:03.336
A blooming hermit he wants to be.
He'll be back in less than a month.

35:03.980 --> 35:06.312
I can't wait that long.

35:06.483 --> 35:09.941
- Were there any other survivors?
- No.

35:10.253 --> 35:13.484
- How far is it to St. Pierre?
- About 100 miles.

35:13.657 --> 35:16.854
Are you going to see this other chap
who claims he saw it?

35:17.027 --> 35:20.053
I say, you don't believe
in the sea serpent fable, do you?

35:20.230 --> 35:23.290
What do you think I am, balmy?

35:34.577 --> 35:37.011
Good evening, Jacob.

35:37.213 --> 35:40.239
You look much better today.

35:40.950 --> 35:46.252
A man is here.
A very great scientist from New York.

35:46.423 --> 35:50.484
No, Sister. Take him away.
I want no one near me.

35:50.660 --> 35:54.687
He went to so much trouble to find you.

35:54.864 --> 35:55.956
Why?

35:56.132 --> 35:58.930
He says it is very important.

35:59.102 --> 36:04.199
It's about the beast you saw.

36:04.374 --> 36:07.366
Tell him to leave me alone!
Tell him I saw nothing!

36:07.544 --> 36:09.512
Tell him I know nothing!

36:09.679 --> 36:11.943
Tell him it's all in my head!

36:12.115 --> 36:14.242
That's what everybody says.

36:14.417 --> 36:16.612
Except me, Jacob.

36:16.786 --> 36:19.619
- Who are you?
- I saw the beast too.

36:20.957 --> 36:22.390
You saw him?

36:22.559 --> 36:26.393
- You're not playing jokes on me?
- No, I'm not playing any jokes.

36:26.563 --> 36:29.031
People called me crazy too.

36:29.199 --> 36:31.997
It stays in my mind always.
I'll never forget it.

36:32.168 --> 36:38.198
In New York, there are scientists,
friends of mine, who will listen and believe.

36:38.608 --> 36:42.635
Jacob, will you come to New York
with me?

36:46.616 --> 36:51.576
- Is he well enough to travel?
- I will ask the doctor.

36:55.024 --> 37:01.623
There's something very compensating
in having to wait 30 years for a holiday.

37:01.798 --> 37:03.493
Because when it finally comes...

37:03.666 --> 37:08.103
...the joy of anticipation is multiplied
by just that many years.

37:08.872 --> 37:14.572
I feel like a schoolboy on the verge
of departing for my first summer camp.

37:15.345 --> 37:20.248
Oh, by the way, that reminds me, our young
nuclear physicist appears to be delayed.

37:20.784 --> 37:24.481
He'll be here any minute.
Shouldn't take him long from the airport.

37:24.954 --> 37:28.890
Mesozoic animal alive today.

37:30.059 --> 37:34.519
I can lose my job and my reputation
listening to such nonsense.

37:34.697 --> 37:40.101
However, I won't allow my personal opinion
to interfere with a possible romance.

37:40.270 --> 37:42.898
Don't change the subject.
You're just being stubborn.

37:43.072 --> 37:44.767
Am I?

37:44.941 --> 37:49.378
Now, just you listen to this.
It's something that I read this morning.

37:49.546 --> 37:55.314
"On the 21 st of October, in the year 1797,
one Professor Gordon Laughton...

37:55.485 --> 37:58.010
...was forcibly removed,
by order of the Crown...

37:58.188 --> 38:01.680
...from his chair of science
at the University of Edinburgh.

38:01.858 --> 38:04.986
He was firmly convinced
that leprechauns were responsible...

38:05.161 --> 38:07.425
...for the uprooting
of the ancient campus oak.

38:07.597 --> 38:12.432
Even swearing upon oath
that he had seen them remove it."

38:12.602 --> 38:16.663
So, you see, today,
it's monsters instead of leprechauns.

38:16.840 --> 38:19.809
How certain are you
there were no leprechauns?

38:19.976 --> 38:20.965
Hello, Lee.

38:21.144 --> 38:24.170
I don't recall this Dr. Laughton,
but what about Galileo?

38:24.347 --> 38:26.542
He said the earth was round.
They made him recant.

38:26.716 --> 38:32.052
However, the earth is round. And there is
a monster. And I think I can convince you.

38:32.222 --> 38:34.918
- Is this your sailor witness?
- Yes, sir.

38:35.091 --> 38:40.495
Jacob Bowman, the helmsman of the
fishing boat Fortune. Dr. Elson, Miss Hunter.

38:41.297 --> 38:45.734
- So you saw the monster too?
- Yes, sir.

38:46.469 --> 38:48.869
Go ahead, my dear.
This is your experiment.

38:49.038 --> 38:53.668
Jacob, I want you to look through those
sketches and pick out the one you saw.

38:55.745 --> 38:58.213
You don't think this is
a waste of time?

38:58.381 --> 39:01.111
Several days ago
at Miss Hunter's apartment...

39:01.284 --> 39:06.051
...I picked out the sketch of the beast
I saw. It's right in that batch.

39:06.222 --> 39:11.319
But, unfortunately, in paleontology,
the empirical system of logic isn't enough.

39:11.494 --> 39:14.088
It isn't a question of empirics.

39:14.297 --> 39:17.994
If a particle of the sun broke off
and flew into space...

39:18.167 --> 39:21.227
...I wouldn't consider the man
who brought that news to be insane.

39:21.404 --> 39:24.134
As a scientist, I would
examine every facet of it.

39:24.307 --> 39:28.869
Yes, but if a particle of the sun were to
break off, 100 million people would see it.

39:29.045 --> 39:32.811
If it broke off, it would make no difference
if one saw it or no one at all.

39:32.982 --> 39:34.347
It would still be.

39:34.517 --> 39:37.680
The same with the monster. It still is.

39:40.189 --> 39:43.090
Perhaps I'm getting old.

39:43.726 --> 39:48.095
Now, Jacob, you must be quite sure
about this creature you claim to have seen.

39:48.264 --> 39:50.562
There must be no doubt in your mind.

39:50.733 --> 39:54.100
If it's here, I'll know it.

40:10.620 --> 40:12.918
- That.
- That's the one I picked.

40:15.058 --> 40:19.654
It's the rhedosaurus,
extinct for 100 million years.

40:20.229 --> 40:23.289
- A hundred million years?
- Yes.

40:23.466 --> 40:27.095
And the direct ancestor
of that little lady there.

40:27.270 --> 40:30.000
Only twice the size, according to theory.

40:31.040 --> 40:33.668
The only fossils of its species
ever discovered...

40:33.843 --> 40:36.812
...were found in a drag of the Hudson
submarine canyons.

40:36.980 --> 40:39.141
A hundred and fifty miles
from New York.

40:39.315 --> 40:42.807
Didn't Professor Edmonds
write a paper on that just last year?

40:42.986 --> 40:44.817
Yes.

40:45.688 --> 40:47.519
Yes.

40:47.924 --> 40:51.655
If we could only be sure,
without a shadow of a doubt...

40:51.828 --> 40:53.921
What further proof do you need?

40:54.097 --> 40:57.157
Things have happened again and again,
and they'll continue.

40:57.333 --> 41:00.769
I tried to get the authorities to keep
the coastline under close watch...

41:00.937 --> 41:04.202
...they wouldn't listen to me.
- They'll listen this time.

41:04.374 --> 41:07.036
Get them on the phone.
I'll talk to them.

41:08.211 --> 41:09.303
Thanks.

41:13.483 --> 41:15.815
Col. Evans, please.

41:17.553 --> 41:19.111
Jack.

41:19.422 --> 41:21.253
Tom Nesbitt.

41:21.424 --> 41:23.051
I feel great.

41:23.226 --> 41:24.853
That hallucination of mine...

41:25.028 --> 41:28.930
...the one that everybody
was having such a good laugh about?

41:29.098 --> 41:31.726
Well, I've got proof the monster exists.

41:31.901 --> 41:35.268
Now, Tom, let's not start that again.

41:35.905 --> 41:37.236
What?

41:37.407 --> 41:42.310
I can just see myself requesting permission
to seek out a prehistoric monster.

41:42.478 --> 41:45.003
Eagles on a straitjacket
are not regulation uniform.

41:45.181 --> 41:51.381
I'm here at the university with Dr. Elson,
the foremost paleontologist in the world.

41:51.554 --> 41:54.682
Just a moment.
He wants to talk to you.

41:55.691 --> 41:58.216
Col. Evans. This is Dr. Elson.

41:58.394 --> 42:02.660
I'm convinced that Professor Nesbitt
is onto something.

42:02.832 --> 42:06.666
There have been all kinds of stories.
Stories of sea serpents...

42:06.836 --> 42:10.397
...stories of the world coming to an end,
stories of flying saucers.

42:10.573 --> 42:13.599
What makes you so sure
there are no flying saucers?

42:13.776 --> 42:20.181
Nevertheless, I'm convinced that by some
strange trick of chance, this creature exists.

42:20.349 --> 42:22.783
And I'm prepared to stake
my reputation on it.

42:22.952 --> 42:25.420
I'm sure you know
what you're talking about, doctor...

42:25.588 --> 42:28.182
...but it would look foolish
if we stick our neck out.

42:28.357 --> 42:31.690
Will you promise if any reports come in,
you'll let us know?

42:31.861 --> 42:35.729
I've got a friend in the Coast Guard.
I'll drop in to see him.

42:35.898 --> 42:38.958
If he's heard of anything,
I'll get in touch with you. Okay?

42:39.235 --> 42:42.568
Thank you, colonel.
We'll appreciate it.

42:42.738 --> 42:45.366
He's going to check and let us know.

42:45.541 --> 42:50.808
- We can't just sit around.
- I'm afraid there's nothing else we can do.

42:50.980 --> 42:52.743
But wait.

43:03.626 --> 43:07.221
I heard a new song at the tavern
the other day.

43:07.396 --> 43:10.797
Something about gin and wild women.

43:10.967 --> 43:14.562
- How'd it go?
- Oh, I don't remember.

43:14.737 --> 43:18.002
I stuck five nickels in the box
to hear it again...

43:18.174 --> 43:20.267
...and the thing busted down.

43:20.443 --> 43:26.575
You know me, I couldn't carry a tune
in a bushel basket.

43:26.749 --> 43:31.880
I like the ballads. The old ones that warm
you even when the fog is a foot thick.

43:51.941 --> 43:53.909
Did you hear that?

44:39.326 --> 44:40.657
Come in.

44:41.195 --> 44:42.856
That's all.

44:43.197 --> 44:46.724
- Jack, how are you?
- Phil, at this moment, I don't know.

44:46.900 --> 44:48.492
Well, sit down. Sit down.

44:48.669 --> 44:51.934
I haven't seen you
since the last Army-Navy game.

44:52.105 --> 44:54.369
What a game that was.

44:54.541 --> 44:56.839
What's the problem?
AEC getting you down?

44:57.010 --> 44:58.477
- No, not at all.
- Good.

44:58.645 --> 45:01.978
Stick around. I'll be through
in a minute. We'll go to the club.

45:02.149 --> 45:04.276
Phil, here it is straight.

45:04.451 --> 45:07.909
One of the scientists in the last polar test
claims he saw a monster.

45:08.088 --> 45:11.489
The dean of the College of Natural History
believes him.

45:11.658 --> 45:15.822
Then who am I to doubt it? Are you
trying to get a Section 8 discharge?

45:15.996 --> 45:17.293
A neurotic colonel.

45:17.464 --> 45:22.197
These scientists claim that this monster
or beast, this prehistoric thing...

45:22.369 --> 45:27.170
...and if you laugh, I'll brain you,
is romping around the North Atlantic.

45:27.341 --> 45:29.901
I guess you'll have to brain me.
You're nuts!

45:30.077 --> 45:34.411
Anyway, that's what they say.
Look, Phil. Would you do me a favor?

45:34.581 --> 45:39.712
Check around to see if there have been any
reports of any freak or unusual happenings.

45:39.887 --> 45:43.584
- Are you on the level?
- Lf standing on my head's on the level, I am.

45:43.757 --> 45:46.157
You certainly sound serious.

45:46.426 --> 45:50.453
All right, I'll check.
But so help me, if this is a practical joke...

45:50.631 --> 45:53.361
I'll die laughing.

46:38.545 --> 46:43.448
Well, that's it.
No storm, no earthquake, nothing...

46:43.617 --> 46:46.586
...but that lighthouse
was destroyed completely.

46:46.853 --> 46:49.117
Were there any other
unexplained happenings?

46:49.289 --> 46:52.986
Yes. Coast Guard station 37
reported minor shore wreckage...

46:53.160 --> 46:57.221
...along the Massachusetts coast.
Several isolated buildings were destroyed.

46:57.397 --> 47:00.423
And a farmer was found
crushed to death.

47:00.601 --> 47:04.537
There's a certain inexorable chronology
in these disasters.

47:04.705 --> 47:07.071
I don't follow you, doctor.

47:07.240 --> 47:10.732
Tom first saw the rhedosaurus
near Baffin Bay.

47:10.911 --> 47:14.847
While his latest presumed presence
was off the coast of Massachusetts.

47:15.115 --> 47:18.915
- May I look at your chart, captain?
- Of course.

47:25.926 --> 47:28.793
Now, first...

47:29.029 --> 47:32.021
...north of Baffin Bay.

47:32.566 --> 47:37.560
Second, the fishing ketch Fortune
was wrecked here...

47:37.738 --> 47:39.968
...off the Grand Banks.

47:40.140 --> 47:43.371
And another one attacked
shortly thereafter.

47:43.543 --> 47:46.944
Here. Nova Scotia.

47:47.114 --> 47:52.142
Third, the lighthouse
off the coast of Maine.

47:52.719 --> 47:57.816
Fourth, unexplained wreckage
off the coast of Massachusetts.

47:57.991 --> 48:03.452
You'll notice we've been following
the Arctic Current all the way down.

48:04.097 --> 48:09.558
So it's just possible that he might
be making for here.

48:09.736 --> 48:14.503
It was in these submerged canyons that
the only fossils of his species were found.

48:14.875 --> 48:17.309
We could mine those canyons.

48:17.477 --> 48:20.105
And kill the rhedosaurus? Oh, no.

48:20.280 --> 48:23.647
Think what a loss to science
that would be. Oh, no.

48:23.817 --> 48:26.718
But to capture it alive
would be an achievement.

48:26.887 --> 48:31.290
How do you propose to capture it,
if it exists?

48:31.458 --> 48:36.896
I don't know. But if we ascertain
it's down there in the canyons...

48:37.064 --> 48:40.625
...l'll have to go see it before I decide
upon a method of capture.

48:40.801 --> 48:42.598
That's much too dangerous.

48:42.769 --> 48:48.264
Yes, but then the risk would be worth it
when one thinks of the benefit to science.

48:48.442 --> 48:52.776
Captain, is it possible to obtain
the use of a diving bell?

48:52.946 --> 48:55.710
- You really want to go down there?
- Yes.

48:55.882 --> 48:58.043
I can get a diving bell.

48:58.218 --> 49:00.311
What do you think, Jack?

49:01.588 --> 49:04.751
Everything else checks out.
If he can get it, let's move.

49:04.925 --> 49:06.859
Thank you.

49:17.170 --> 49:21.038
I still don't see how he's gonna find it.
This canyon is 100 miles long.

49:21.208 --> 49:25.804
As I understand it, he plans to drop down
at a different spot every hour till he finds it.

49:25.979 --> 49:31.007
Hear this. Hear this. We are now ready
to make the dive at position number one.

49:31.184 --> 49:34.119
I don't like the idea of you going
with just one man.

49:34.287 --> 49:38.155
That's capacity. If there's any danger,
my crewman will know what to do.

49:38.325 --> 49:40.725
- I brought your Dramamine.
- No, thank you.

49:40.894 --> 49:44.227
I'm much too excited to get seasick.

49:44.397 --> 49:46.365
Are you ready, Dr. Elson?

49:46.533 --> 49:49.400
Remember, at the first sign
of danger, signal us.

49:49.569 --> 49:52.129
Why will you persist
in talking about danger?

49:52.305 --> 49:54.637
The rhedosaurus and I are old friends.

49:54.808 --> 49:57.538
- Good luck, doctor.
- Thank you.

50:02.249 --> 50:05.184
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.

50:07.487 --> 50:10.513
Don't look so worried, Lee.
We're scientists.

50:10.690 --> 50:14.990
This is our job.
This is a great moment for me.

50:40.320 --> 50:42.311
Everything shipshape in there?

50:42.489 --> 50:47.256
Splendid, thank you.
All the comforts of home. Lower away.

50:48.161 --> 50:50.493
Hoist away.

51:20.660 --> 51:22.753
Is there anything I have to do?

51:22.929 --> 51:27.263
Oh, no, sir.
You just relax and enjoy the scenery.

51:47.988 --> 51:50.422
This is such a strange feeling.

51:50.590 --> 51:53.388
I feel I am leaving
a world of untold tomorrows...

51:53.560 --> 51:57.052
...for a world of countless yesterdays.

52:05.305 --> 52:10.709
Lee was right. I should have brought
the Dramamine pills.

52:20.453 --> 52:25.891
This is all very frustrating. I do hope all
our endeavors are not going to be in vain.

52:45.946 --> 52:48.915
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, doctor.

52:53.987 --> 52:59.220
We are having coffee now.
And some visitors.

53:14.507 --> 53:19.501
There appears to be a difference of opinion
between two of the local inhabitants.

54:20.940 --> 54:22.931
There he is!

54:27.914 --> 54:30.849
It's unbelievable.

54:31.451 --> 54:33.316
He's tremendous.

54:33.920 --> 54:35.979
I can only see part of him...

54:36.156 --> 54:40.422
...the leg and the shoulder,
but he is enormous.

54:40.593 --> 54:42.618
He found it.
Shall we pull you up?

54:42.796 --> 54:45.697
No! No! No, put Lee on.

54:46.399 --> 54:47.866
He wants to talk to you.

54:49.369 --> 54:50.358
Yes, doctor.

54:50.537 --> 54:55.406
Lee, there's no mistake about it.
It's a Paleolithic survival.

54:55.575 --> 55:00.342
It's exactly as we pictured it except
the dorsal is singular, not bilateral.

55:03.716 --> 55:08.016
The clavicle suspension
appears to be cantileveric.

55:12.158 --> 55:15.150
But the most
astonishing thing about it is...

55:21.501 --> 55:23.526
He doesn't answer.

55:26.406 --> 55:28.966
- Get him up.
- Raise the bell.

55:31.144 --> 55:34.545
We're pulling you up!
Dr. Elson!

55:37.417 --> 55:40.181
Can you hear me? Answer me!

55:43.890 --> 55:45.915
The line is dead.

56:06.846 --> 56:08.507
Well, the report has been turned in.

56:08.681 --> 56:13.414
The National Guard and Coast Guard
have been alerted. Evans is in charge.

56:13.586 --> 56:16.851
This was being packed
for a very different reason.

56:17.991 --> 56:19.720
What can I say?

56:19.893 --> 56:22.453
I should have gone down instead of him.
I am to blame.

56:22.629 --> 56:25.894
Nobody is to blame.
And everybody is to blame.

56:26.065 --> 56:29.330
We all did what we thought was right.

56:29.502 --> 56:31.800
But that doesn't bring him
through the door again.

56:31.971 --> 56:36.874
With his funny little walk,
and that wonderful smile.

56:37.043 --> 56:39.876
This place seems so empty.

56:41.214 --> 56:46.242
He used to putter around with the
specimens and call them pet names.

56:49.522 --> 56:51.956
His death was so futile.

56:53.726 --> 56:57.321
He went down in that bell
because it was part of his job.

56:58.064 --> 57:00.862
He used those same words just before...

57:01.034 --> 57:02.501
Oh, Tom.

59:57.977 --> 01:00:01.071
It's coming up Nassau Street toward Pine.
Get some help fast!

01:02:30.196 --> 01:02:31.925
New York is like a city besieged.

01:02:32.098 --> 01:02:33.861
A state of emergency
has been declared...

01:02:34.033 --> 01:02:36.797
...and the entire police force
put on 24-hour duty.

01:02:36.969 --> 01:02:38.903
Civilian defense is fully mobilized...

01:02:39.071 --> 01:02:42.563
...and shelters have been opened
in an effort to stop the mounting hysteria.

01:02:42.975 --> 01:02:44.499
All traffic has been halted.

01:02:44.677 --> 01:02:49.011
And Times Square, the heart
of New York, has stopped beating.

01:02:55.254 --> 01:02:58.781
The National Guard has been called out,
fully armed, to repel the invader.

01:02:58.958 --> 01:03:01.620
This is full-scale war
against a terrible enemy...

01:03:01.794 --> 01:03:04.695
...such as modern man
has never before faced.

01:03:04.964 --> 01:03:07.228
Ordinary bullets have no effect...

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:12.133
...and a method of destroying the awesome
creature has not yet been formulated.

01:03:12.371 --> 01:03:14.498
But the battlefield has been cleared.

01:03:14.674 --> 01:03:16.665
Herald Square.

01:03:16.842 --> 01:03:18.036
34th Street.

01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:19.268
Broadway.

01:03:19.445 --> 01:03:21.640
Every section of the city is guarded.

01:03:21.814 --> 01:03:24.715
No one knows where the monster
will strike next.

01:03:24.884 --> 01:03:28.115
It was last seen on Wall Street,
close to where it came ashore.

01:03:28.287 --> 01:03:30.915
But lower Manhattan has become
no man's land...

01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:33.183
...where the beast, at present,
lies hidden.

01:03:33.359 --> 01:03:35.418
The National Guard
is barricading the area...

01:03:35.595 --> 01:03:38.120
...in an effort to confine
the death and destruction...

01:03:38.297 --> 01:03:41.198
...of what is already the worst disaster
in New York's history.

01:03:48.474 --> 01:03:50.339
A screen here.

01:03:52.979 --> 01:03:55.777
105 temperature.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:02.753
Here's the blood specimen.

01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:05.789
Get it to the laboratory quickly.
I'm afraid, Sam.

01:04:05.958 --> 01:04:10.088
I am afraid of what that creature
has brought to us. Deadly afraid.

01:04:50.836 --> 01:04:53.703
- Think you can place it between his eyes?
- We can try, sir.

01:04:53.873 --> 01:04:55.807
- Fire when ready, corporal.
- Yes, sir.

01:04:55.975 --> 01:04:57.738
His skull...

01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:59.810
...it's at least 8 inches thick.

01:05:12.058 --> 01:05:13.685
- Another one, colonel?
- No.

01:05:13.859 --> 01:05:16.419
It would take a 3-inch shell
to penetrate that skull.

01:05:20.399 --> 01:05:22.390
Bazooka squad, prepare to fire.

01:05:36.615 --> 01:05:39.243
The high-voltage wires,
it's gonna touch them!

01:05:43.856 --> 01:05:45.289
Bazooka men, fire!

01:05:50.596 --> 01:05:52.621
Under the neck,
when he raises his head again.

01:06:26.398 --> 01:06:28.798
Get those emergency search lights on!

01:06:28.968 --> 01:06:30.333
We're working on it.

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:37.200
Sergeant. Sergeant!

01:06:39.078 --> 01:06:41.308
- What is it?
- Blood.

01:07:20.119 --> 01:07:22.053
Give me the walkie-talkie.

01:07:25.925 --> 01:07:28.120
Col. Evans.
Col. Evans?

01:07:28.294 --> 01:07:29.283
Sgt. Wyntoni.

01:07:29.461 --> 01:07:31.725
Now, look,
proceed with extreme caution.

01:07:31.897 --> 01:07:35.458
Wounded, the animal might be twice
as dangerous as before.

01:07:42.474 --> 01:07:45.602
There's a possibility the animal
might've headed for the river.

01:07:45.778 --> 01:07:48.747
We'll have all shore batteries alerted
and naval patrol vessels.

01:07:48.914 --> 01:07:50.381
Get me a command car!

01:08:05.264 --> 01:08:07.960
- Col. Evans speaking, go ahead.
- Look, colonel...

01:08:08.133 --> 01:08:10.033
...something's funny.

01:08:10.369 --> 01:08:12.337
Most of the detail, they're...

01:08:12.504 --> 01:08:14.335
Well, they're out.

01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:16.435
Out on their feet, sir.

01:08:16.609 --> 01:08:19.600
Have your sergeant contact the medics.
And report to Capt. Mitchell.

01:08:19.879 --> 01:08:21.176
Your car is ready, sir.

01:08:21.346 --> 01:08:23.076
Have the medical officer report
to me...

01:08:23.249 --> 01:08:25.080
...at area command.
- Yes, sir.

01:08:28.254 --> 01:08:31.348
He is reported somewhere
in the lower bay area.

01:08:31.523 --> 01:08:35.892
- Battery A in position zero.
- Battery A into position zero.

01:08:38.063 --> 01:08:41.828

- Report radar finding.

01:08:42.001 --> 01:08:45.129
Sounding harbor bottom.
Sounding harbor bottom.

01:08:45.304 --> 01:08:50.832
- Activate mines, numbers 8 to 24.
- Activate mines, numbers 8 to 24.

01:08:51.977 --> 01:08:53.274
What's the situation, major?

01:08:53.444 --> 01:08:56.743
We're sounding the harbor bottom.
No indications yet, sir.

01:08:58.050 --> 01:09:00.541
Charting room. Col. Evans?

01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:03.243
Majors, there's a call here
for Col. Evans.

01:09:03.756 --> 01:09:06.316
This is Evans speaking.
Who?

01:09:06.492 --> 01:09:07.720
Oh, yes. Hello, doctor.

01:09:07.893 --> 01:09:12.193
Colonel, they've already brought in over 50
of your men and the people this afternoon.

01:09:12.363 --> 01:09:15.697
The monster's a giant germ-carrier
of a horrible, virulent disease.

01:09:15.868 --> 01:09:18.803
Contact with the animal's blood
can be fatal.

01:09:19.604 --> 01:09:23.336
If you use shell-fire, who knows how
far the air will spread the particles of it.

01:09:23.509 --> 01:09:26.774
- The entire city can be endangered.
- Right, doctor.

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:30.939
- Have the anti-submarine nets been raised?
- No, sir.

01:09:31.116 --> 01:09:32.481
Order them raised.

01:09:32.651 --> 01:09:36.246
- Raise the anti-submarine nets.
- Raise the anti-submarine nets.

01:09:36.421 --> 01:09:39.880
Flamethrowers would've cremated
the beast and the plague with it.

01:09:40.059 --> 01:09:43.688
Flamethrowers? The smoke would have
carried the blood particles just as far.

01:09:43.862 --> 01:09:48.094
No, it will have to be reduced
so that not even a cinder would remain.

01:09:48.533 --> 01:09:50.194
Any reports yet, major?

01:09:50.368 --> 01:09:51.836
No signs yet, colonel.

01:09:52.004 --> 01:09:55.770
He may be dying at the bottom.
We'll set the drags in the morning.

01:09:55.941 --> 01:10:00.469
Attention! Monster ashore at Manhattan
Beach, heading towards amusement area.

01:10:00.646 --> 01:10:03.843
- On land?
- I thought we had him in a corner pocket.

01:10:04.016 --> 01:10:06.576
Jack, there's only one way
to beat him.

01:10:06.752 --> 01:10:07.776
How?

01:10:07.953 --> 01:10:09.750
Radioactive isotope.

01:10:09.922 --> 01:10:13.221
Shoot it into him and destroy
all that diseased tissue.

01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:05.534
Keep your men alerted.
But nobody's to fire unless ordered to.

01:11:05.711 --> 01:11:06.803
Yes, sir.

01:11:07.379 --> 01:11:09.176
How soon, Tom?

01:11:09.348 --> 01:11:11.612
Should be any minute now.

01:11:32.504 --> 01:11:34.472
Wait for us here.

01:11:52.991 --> 01:11:55.585
- I'm Professor Nesbitt.
- We've got your baby, professor.

01:11:55.761 --> 01:11:56.819
Good.

01:11:56.995 --> 01:11:59.759
- We need your best marksman, Jack.
- Right.

01:11:59.932 --> 01:12:01.957
Have him get into these.

01:12:16.448 --> 01:12:18.439
Here's your man, Tom.

01:12:19.485 --> 01:12:22.181
- Colonel says you need a dead shot, mister.
- Yes.

01:12:22.354 --> 01:12:24.549
- Ever use a grenade rifle?
- Pick my teeth with it.

01:12:24.723 --> 01:12:25.951
Good.

01:12:26.125 --> 01:12:28.116
You know what
a radioactive isotope is?

01:12:28.293 --> 01:12:31.387
- No, but if it can be loaded, I can fire it.
- I'll load it.

01:12:31.563 --> 01:12:35.124
Just remember one thing:
It has to be shot into the wound.

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:37.063
And you have to make it
the first time.

01:12:37.236 --> 01:12:41.798
This is the only isotope of its kind this
side of Oak Ridge, so you can't miss.

01:12:41.974 --> 01:12:43.942
Let's get to the target.

01:13:39.464 --> 01:13:41.796
I can't hit him from here, mister.

01:13:46.471 --> 01:13:50.032
- Ever ride one of those things?
- Yes, sir.

01:13:51.243 --> 01:13:54.906
Jack! Get somebody over here
who can operate that roller coaster!

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.878
We want to get to the top
in one of those cars.

01:13:58.050 --> 01:13:59.540
Right!

01:13:59.918 --> 01:14:03.081
- Put your hood on.
- Yes, sir.

01:19:41.993 --> 01:19:42.982
