WEBVTT

00:09.400 --> 00:10.579
All right, chins up,

00:10.579 --> 00:11.912
eyes open, no cock-ups.

00:11.914 --> 00:14.247
Keep it easy-breezy, nobody gets nicked.

00:14.249 --> 00:19.553
Now look sharp, 'cause this guy
wants to get Ritchie.

00:21.807 --> 00:23.507
'Ello guv'nah.

00:23.509 --> 00:25.058
How can I help you?

00:25.060 --> 00:26.727
Here to sweep the chimneys.

00:26.729 --> 00:29.096
Oh! Yes. The fireplace is in the vault.

00:29.098 --> 00:30.147
Right this way.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:51.503 --> 00:53.370
Ah.

00:54.039 --> 00:58.041
Vault one on the left. Enjoy the bank.

00:58.043 --> 01:01.378
The chimney's over here. She's a beauty.

01:02.265 --> 01:03.547
We'll take it from here, mate.

01:03.549 --> 01:06.266
- All right, lads, step in time.
- Okay, then.

01:06.268 --> 01:09.019
Wait a minute. We had the
chimneys swept yesterday.

01:09.021 --> 01:10.454
Ohh!

01:13.942 --> 01:16.610
Get that back to the lab.

01:17.213 --> 01:18.562
What are we looking at, Scholls?

01:18.564 --> 01:19.319
Bank robbery.

01:19.319 --> 01:21.602
- Looks like that British gang again.
- How can you tell?

01:24.396 --> 01:25.512
Just a hunch.

01:25.514 --> 01:26.871
They made off with cash, jewels,

01:26.897 --> 01:29.538
family heirlooms, two jet skis,
and a dining-room set.

01:29.540 --> 01:31.374
How much do you think that was worth?

01:31.376 --> 01:32.875
$65,000! $66,000!

01:32.877 --> 01:34.210
I'm gonna go with $3 million.

01:34.212 --> 01:35.428
$1.

01:35.430 --> 01:36.596
The actual retail value

01:36.598 --> 01:39.275
of this robbery was $2.5 million.

01:39.307 --> 01:41.391
Geils, you overbid. Tribeca wins.

01:41.393 --> 01:42.558
- Yes!
- Damn it.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.093
Now, lucky for us, they're getting sloppy.

01:44.095 --> 01:45.895
They left behind two dozen lager cans,

01:45.897 --> 01:47.897
a Manchester United scarf, and this guy.

01:47.899 --> 01:50.566
Oy, you bugger.

01:50.568 --> 01:51.651
Cuff him.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.686
In a minute. He's "sweeping."

02:03.281 --> 02:06.449
Yes! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yes! Yes!

02:06.451 --> 02:07.784
I'm out of here.

02:07.786 --> 02:09.452
Damn it! That's five banks this month!

02:09.454 --> 02:12.839
And public distrust of chimney
sweeps is at an all time high!

02:12.841 --> 02:14.374
What about the guy you picked up?

02:14.376 --> 02:16.876
We've got Tanner and Hoffman
working on him right now.

02:18.296 --> 02:20.263
You heard him.
What did you do with the money?

02:20.265 --> 02:22.265
Bruv, I's goin' down to da pub
with my mates, yeah?

02:22.267 --> 02:23.633
Next fing I know, my dog's
ringing and I hafta answer it

02:23.635 --> 02:24.884
'cause of the trouble,
d'ya know what I mean?

02:28.390 --> 02:29.522
I got this.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.524
Well...

02:33.003 --> 02:36.138
Looks like I have to speak
a language you understand.

03:05.699 --> 03:08.700
I don't Adam and Eve dat for a tic.

03:08.702 --> 03:10.451
So cut the shite and chew da fat.

03:10.453 --> 03:12.003
Bloody hell, you got bigger cobblers

03:12.005 --> 03:13.338
den my skin and blister, mate.

03:13.340 --> 03:15.506
Give us a butcher's into your organization

03:15.508 --> 03:18.376
or you'll be Jack Jones
in a pretty little box

03:18.378 --> 03:19.961
until Boxing Day.

03:19.963 --> 03:23.514
All right, all right.

03:23.516 --> 03:24.882
Here's the deal.

03:27.646 --> 03:28.812
He doesn't know where the loot is,

03:28.814 --> 03:29.891
but Tanner got the name of a hideout.

03:29.891 --> 03:32.821
It's a pub in Little Liverpool
called Robby McBanks.

03:32.868 --> 03:34.708
- All right, let's go get them.
- Hold on.

03:34.778 --> 03:36.194
There's something you should know.

03:36.946 --> 03:38.779
During the robbery, they stole something

03:38.781 --> 03:40.598
much more valuable than cash and prizes.

03:40.598 --> 03:41.931
The love of a child?

03:41.933 --> 03:43.433
The bank kept a flash drive
containing every

03:43.435 --> 03:45.802
customer's answers to
their security questions.

03:45.804 --> 03:47.470
We're talking first pet...

03:47.472 --> 03:49.188
Mr. Muffins... mother's maiden name...

03:49.190 --> 03:50.890
Muffins... street you grew up on...

03:50.892 --> 03:52.642
Muffin Avenue... favorite food.

03:52.644 --> 03:54.842
- Ravioli.
- My god.

03:54.890 --> 03:56.640
With those answers
they could access accounts...

03:56.642 --> 03:58.341
We all understand how bad it is!

03:58.343 --> 03:59.759
We don't need a long explanation.

03:59.761 --> 04:02.469
We also understand they'll never
give it up knowingly,

04:02.469 --> 04:03.719
especially to a police officer,

04:03.720 --> 04:06.670
because we arrest people
for stealing things.

04:06.672 --> 04:08.442
If we could infiltrate the gang...

04:08.497 --> 04:10.364
We all understand what can happen

04:10.367 --> 04:11.916
once you infiltrate a gang.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.484
We don't need a long explanation!

04:14.483 --> 04:16.593
- We're going undercover.
- Even deeper.

04:16.639 --> 04:17.829
We're going undercover.

04:17.829 --> 04:18.687
Deeper than that.

04:18.733 --> 04:19.612
We're going undercover.

04:19.711 --> 04:21.574
That's right... deep cover.

04:21.676 --> 04:23.659
For your own safety,
the department will disavow

04:23.739 --> 04:25.167
any knowledge of you or this assignment.

04:25.192 --> 04:26.651
We all know how deep cover works.

04:26.765 --> 04:28.263
We don't need a long explanation!

04:28.263 --> 04:29.796
See Edelweiss on your way out

04:29.798 --> 04:31.715
for your psychological evaluations.

04:31.717 --> 04:34.217
Here are your new passports,
drivers licenses,

04:34.219 --> 04:35.552
and social security numbers,

04:35.554 --> 04:37.270
everything you'll need
to start your new life.

04:37.272 --> 04:39.346
We've even included grandparents.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.727
Why is there only one set of grandparents?

04:43.729 --> 04:46.123
I'm sorry, Geils, yours died
while you were at camp.

04:46.123 --> 04:47.622
Nana, Pee-Paw.

04:47.624 --> 04:49.841
I'm sorry.

04:49.843 --> 04:51.209
Stay close to him.

04:54.549 --> 04:55.799
Dr. Edelweiss?

04:55.899 --> 04:58.288
Ah, Tribeca, what can I do for you?

04:58.288 --> 04:59.840
- We have to infiltrate a ga...
- Aah!

04:59.879 --> 05:01.608
Oh. Geils.

05:01.608 --> 05:04.409
You're here, fantastic.
Well, let's have a look.

05:05.578 --> 05:08.445
Oh... ah.

05:09.145 --> 05:11.583
Oh, someone's going deep cover.

05:11.585 --> 05:13.701
Why does everyone say that?
Is it that big of a deal?

05:13.703 --> 05:15.453
No, no, no, it's pretty standard stuff.

05:15.455 --> 05:17.372
And once Dr. Scholls gets here,
we can begin.

05:17.374 --> 05:18.571
I'm right here.

05:18.771 --> 05:21.266
Ah, Scholls, there you are. Marvelous.

05:21.381 --> 05:22.663
Okay, let's get started.

05:22.665 --> 05:24.799
Great. Let's get your memories erased.

05:24.801 --> 05:26.292
Our what, what?

05:26.394 --> 05:27.977
If you're going to go into deep cover,

05:27.979 --> 05:29.511
you need to forget everything
about yourself

05:29.513 --> 05:30.562
in case they torture you.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.730
In case they what?

05:31.732 --> 05:33.265
Having second thoughts?

05:33.267 --> 05:34.516
Second what?

05:34.518 --> 05:36.328
Oh, relax, Detective.

05:36.353 --> 05:38.152
This is just basic hypnosis.

05:38.177 --> 05:40.176
Once you're under,
you won't remember a thing.

05:40.176 --> 05:42.677
This is as easy as me snapping my fing...

05:42.679 --> 05:44.062
Snapping my fingers.

05:44.041 --> 05:47.234
Wait, so after you do this,
we won't remember anything?

05:47.234 --> 05:49.041
Exactly. Not even this conversation.

05:49.148 --> 05:50.554
In that case...

05:59.728 --> 06:00.591
Go for it, Doc.

06:00.616 --> 06:02.332
Okay, you're in a dark wood.

06:02.466 --> 06:04.209
The light is shimmering
through a canopy of trees...

06:04.209 --> 06:05.193
And sleep!

06:05.543 --> 06:07.042
Yes, they're completely out now.

06:07.044 --> 06:08.260
Did you really just kiss me?

06:08.262 --> 06:10.095
- And sleep.
- Where did that come from?

06:10.097 --> 06:12.214
- Can we try it again?
- And sleep!

06:12.216 --> 06:14.214
Geils, we need to talk about this.

06:14.399 --> 06:18.251
Who's Geils? I have no idea where I am.

06:18.251 --> 06:20.334
- Geils.
- Yep. Oh, damn it!

06:20.336 --> 06:21.836
Ohh. And sleep!

06:21.838 --> 06:23.304
Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep!

06:23.306 --> 06:25.172
If you have feelings for me,
we need to talk about this

06:25.174 --> 06:27.925
before we go into this
very dangerous situation.

06:27.927 --> 06:29.927
Sleep!

06:29.929 --> 06:32.146
Now they're under.

06:33.517 --> 06:35.183
- Geils!
- Edelweiss!

06:35.185 --> 06:37.553
Well, maybe this hypnosis thing
doesn't work.

06:37.589 --> 06:38.838
Sleep!

06:40.542 --> 06:42.246
We just won't get tortured, okay?

06:46.496 --> 06:47.595
Kind of left me hanging, Doc.

06:47.835 --> 06:49.668
Don't pout.

06:51.068 --> 06:51.898
Scholls?

07:01.312 --> 07:04.700
I feel like the precinct needs to update
its undercover-gang wardrobe.

07:07.769 --> 07:09.350
You want to talk about that kiss?

07:09.771 --> 07:11.909
No, I'd rather see if one of us
gets killed first.

07:11.909 --> 07:13.025
Can I help you?

07:13.027 --> 07:14.638
We're looking for Nafan, with an "F."

07:14.638 --> 07:16.271
Arms up, legs out.

07:22.111 --> 07:24.028
Okay, now you do me.

07:24.030 --> 07:26.397
Oy, someone looking for me?

07:27.877 --> 07:29.200
Yeah, we're Gary and Nina.

07:29.202 --> 07:30.818
We're looking to join your gang.

07:30.820 --> 07:32.787
How do I know you're not cops?

07:32.789 --> 07:34.372
We promise?

07:34.374 --> 07:35.823
Prove it. Take him out.

07:37.210 --> 07:38.626
- Hey, what are you...?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:38.628 --> 07:40.044
- What's that?
- What are you doing?

07:40.046 --> 07:41.495
You told me to take him out.

07:41.497 --> 07:42.997
Yeah, to dinner.

07:43.373 --> 07:45.707
We like to see a little
camaraderie in the gang.

07:45.732 --> 07:49.433
But Jesus Christmas, you're
way too crazy to be a cop.

07:49.583 --> 07:51.467
I can't believe you were gonna kill me.

07:51.469 --> 07:53.635
Obviously my gun wasn't loaded.

07:53.637 --> 07:55.421
All right, we've got a big job coming up.

07:55.421 --> 07:56.754
We need all the help we can get.

07:56.756 --> 07:58.556
So you're in.

08:01.928 --> 08:05.396
Gary, Nina, meet the rest of the crew.

08:05.398 --> 08:07.565
Eddie Wheels, driver.

08:07.567 --> 08:10.067
Nigel the Fuse, explosives.

08:10.069 --> 08:12.436
Barnaby Fingers, pickpocket.

08:12.438 --> 08:14.438
Freddy Pecs, the muscle.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.774
Cory the Carburetor, mechanic.

08:16.776 --> 08:19.110
Frankie Four Eyes, surveillance.

08:19.112 --> 08:21.112
Oxford Pete, engineer.

08:21.114 --> 08:22.947
Johnny Rocket, munitions.

08:22.949 --> 08:26.117
Earpiece Dennis, communications.

08:26.119 --> 08:27.618
Kung Fu Kenny, chef.

08:27.620 --> 08:29.287
Arthur, intern.

08:29.289 --> 08:31.672
Slash, lead guitar.

08:31.674 --> 08:34.375
Dr. Allen Feinberg, psychiatrist.

08:34.376 --> 08:36.260
Squeaky Dean, dolphin wrangler.

08:36.261 --> 08:38.546
Larry Longlegs, stilts.

08:38.548 --> 08:41.799
And Doris, human resources.

08:41.801 --> 08:44.018
I'm gonna need y'all to fill out your W-9s.

08:48.572 --> 08:51.241
Okay, let's go rob this bank!

08:52.910 --> 08:56.295
Buy that chimney sweep a pint!

08:56.297 --> 08:57.663
Let's do it!

09:05.885 --> 09:07.020
This is the L.A.P.D.

09:07.020 --> 09:08.236
We're just chimney sweeps.

09:08.238 --> 09:10.105
We have you surrounded.

09:11.909 --> 09:14.075
Oy. Oy, easy. Easy.

09:14.077 --> 09:16.661
It's just a broom.

09:16.663 --> 09:19.533
Good job, detectives. They're
going away for a long time.

09:19.533 --> 09:20.198
How long?

09:20.198 --> 09:21.607
Should be 25 years.

09:21.650 --> 09:23.200
But between prison overcrowding,

09:23.202 --> 09:25.582
time for good behavior,
and those adorable accents,

09:25.607 --> 09:26.940
I'd say two months.

09:26.942 --> 09:29.275
So I guess we did it. Deep cover was easy.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.027
Who's up for a beach day?

09:31.029 --> 09:32.996
Don't put your one-piece on just yet.

09:32.998 --> 09:34.330
We tore apart their hideout

09:34.332 --> 09:36.199
and still didn't find that flash drive.

09:36.201 --> 09:38.535
Our best guess is that Nafan still has it.

09:38.537 --> 09:41.538
Our worst guess is
this is all a dog's dream.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.541
It can't be a dog's dream.
Dogs don't see in color.

09:44.543 --> 09:46.543
So we'll go with our best guess.

09:46.545 --> 09:48.525
Then I'm going into prison
to get that flash drive.

09:48.526 --> 09:51.193
That is deep, deep cover.
Are you sure, Tribeca?

09:51.195 --> 09:54.196
She'll be okay. 'Cause I'm going with her.

09:54.198 --> 09:57.165
Geils, go to the beach.
You're not cut out for prison.

09:57.167 --> 09:59.501
People have been telling me that
since I was a kid,

09:59.503 --> 10:00.702
but enough is enough.

10:00.704 --> 10:03.705
If my partner's going inside, so am I.

10:03.707 --> 10:05.374
Fair enough.

10:06.510 --> 10:09.177
And sleep!

10:09.179 --> 10:11.346
Oh, for heaven's sake.

10:19.875 --> 10:21.573
You know, I've never been to prison before.

10:21.573 --> 10:23.740
My dad didn't go till he was 50.

10:23.742 --> 10:25.441
Is that a teardrop tattoo?

10:25.443 --> 10:28.015
Yeah, it's a press-on. I got it
in the prison gift shop.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.786
You're gonna get us killed.

10:29.860 --> 10:32.964
Look, prison is all about getting respect.

10:33.162 --> 10:35.415
We should start by beating
up the biggest guy here.

10:40.729 --> 10:42.400
Looks like I'm the biggest guy here.

10:45.074 --> 10:47.153
Hmm.

10:49.147 --> 10:51.323
I heard you chinned
the biggest bloke in here.

10:51.446 --> 10:52.618
That's right.

10:52.618 --> 10:54.367
Respect.

10:54.369 --> 10:56.253
Bummer the robbery went south, huh?

10:56.255 --> 10:59.206
I just want you to know,
I still got your back.

10:59.208 --> 11:01.208
You can trust me with any secrets.

11:01.210 --> 11:02.676
Here's a secret.

11:02.678 --> 11:04.711
When I find who ratted us out,

11:04.713 --> 11:06.847
I'm gonna tickle them with a feather.

11:06.849 --> 11:08.098
That doesn't sound so bad.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.966
Tickle is Cockney for "kill."

11:10.719 --> 11:12.385
And feather is Cockney for "knife"?

11:12.387 --> 11:14.092
Still feather. It takes a long time.

11:14.092 --> 11:17.460
You know who I would look at? Doris.

11:17.462 --> 11:19.212
What?

11:20.215 --> 11:21.631
Speaking of robberies,

11:21.988 --> 11:23.848
where do you keep
that flash drive you stole?

11:23.880 --> 11:25.894
Gary, I think it's a little forward

11:25.919 --> 11:28.709
to ask our friend who's just
beginning to trust us.

11:28.711 --> 11:30.589
- No, no, we was all thinkin' it.
- Yeah.

11:30.588 --> 11:33.306
There's a big hayfield up near Braxton.

11:33.308 --> 11:35.308
It's a long stone wall

11:35.310 --> 11:37.426
with a big elm tree at the east end.

11:38.730 --> 11:42.264
At the base of that wall,
you'll find a stone

11:42.266 --> 11:44.600
that's got no earthly business being there.

11:44.602 --> 11:45.735
That's a lot to remember.

11:45.737 --> 11:47.153
Can you just give us the short version?

11:47.155 --> 11:48.218
It's right here.

11:50.491 --> 11:52.608
Huh, with all the information
on that flash drive,

11:52.610 --> 11:55.111
I bet you could sell it
for millions of dollars.

11:56.698 --> 12:00.666
You seem very interested
in this flash drive.

12:04.505 --> 12:06.088
Would you like to hold it?

12:06.090 --> 12:08.174
Sure, thanks.

12:12.822 --> 12:14.580
Lieutenant Atkins filled me in,

12:14.580 --> 12:17.131
- did you get everything you need?
- We sure did.

12:17.134 --> 12:19.584
Now we just have to get out
of here with our cover intact.

12:20.076 --> 12:21.564
I was the only one who knew

12:21.564 --> 12:23.013
you are not Nina and Gary,

12:23.015 --> 12:24.648
but are Detectives Tribeca and Geils...

12:24.650 --> 12:28.100
A.K.A. The rats who put away
the Chimney Sweep Gang.

12:28.158 --> 12:30.488
Someone's getting tickled.

12:30.488 --> 12:32.488
Are you leaning on the P.A. button?

12:32.490 --> 12:34.239
Ah.

12:35.012 --> 12:37.346
With these fat elbows,
I didn't feel a thing.

12:37.348 --> 12:39.768
But not to worry... as
long as I'm warden here,

12:39.793 --> 12:41.793
you two are perfectly safe.

12:45.070 --> 12:46.293
That can't be good.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.184
We're screwed.

13:09.184 --> 13:10.350
Guard? Guard.

13:10.352 --> 13:11.434
What do you want?

13:11.436 --> 13:12.898
There's been a mistake.

13:12.898 --> 13:14.014
You need to let us go.

13:14.017 --> 13:15.055
We're L.A.P.D.

13:15.055 --> 13:17.044
We're L.A.P.D.!

13:17.109 --> 13:18.116
I'm an actor!

13:18.116 --> 13:19.282
And I'm a rock star!

13:19.284 --> 13:21.117
Ha ha ha!

13:21.119 --> 13:22.076
Enough!

13:22.076 --> 13:23.826
Let all those officers
and famous people go!

13:23.828 --> 13:25.377
Yeah!

13:25.379 --> 13:27.713
We don't take kindly to liars.

13:28.643 --> 13:30.510
Take them to solitary.

13:34.384 --> 13:35.537
Ladies first.

13:35.537 --> 13:37.087
Stay strong, Geils, you can do this.

13:37.090 --> 13:38.423
Maggot.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.829
See you on the other side, Tribeca.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.104
Hey.

13:45.104 --> 13:46.726
Sorry, we're a little short on space.

13:46.797 --> 13:48.580
You two have to do solitary together.

13:48.582 --> 13:50.332
You'll never break us.

13:50.334 --> 13:52.000
Dibs on the toilet.

13:56.838 --> 13:59.113
Nina, Gary, you're out.

13:59.112 --> 14:01.646
All the pretty horses are eating purple.

14:01.648 --> 14:04.365
I'm sorry, Grandma. I am Sunday.

14:05.702 --> 14:07.568
Give me two minutes... I'm taking a quiz

14:07.570 --> 14:09.370
to figure out what kind of prisoner I am.

14:09.372 --> 14:11.956
- Don't touch me!
- Oh, I'm a snitch.

14:11.958 --> 14:13.908
Forks!

14:22.085 --> 14:25.470
I can't believe it, Geils.
I've never been broken before.

14:25.472 --> 14:26.971
Ah, don't beat yourself up.

14:26.973 --> 14:29.173
Two hours is a long time in a tiny room.

14:29.175 --> 14:31.342
You had no problem with it.

14:32.027 --> 14:33.745
Well, that's because you told me

14:33.792 --> 14:35.396
I could do it and I believed you.

14:35.398 --> 14:38.266
What do we do now? Rot in jail?

14:38.268 --> 14:40.735
No. We break out of here.

14:40.737 --> 14:41.422
How?

14:41.421 --> 14:43.594
Do you remember that movie
"The Shawshank Redemption"?

14:43.623 --> 14:45.563
Yeah, what about it?

14:47.202 --> 14:49.536
They're showing it tonight
in the prison theater.

14:49.538 --> 14:52.539
While everyone's there watching
it, we'll make our move.

14:53.750 --> 14:56.123
I'll go get the supplies while
you figure out a way to tunnel

14:56.123 --> 14:58.079
through these-three-foot-thick
cement walls.

14:58.575 --> 15:00.575
My job seems harder.

15:00.577 --> 15:01.959
I believe in you!

16:13.650 --> 16:14.782
Lights out!

16:14.784 --> 16:16.117
Five more minutes?

16:16.119 --> 16:18.479
- I said, "lights out!"
- We're starting the movie.

16:23.543 --> 16:25.459
All came together on my end.
How did you do?

16:25.485 --> 16:26.437
Pretty good.

16:26.437 --> 16:28.952
- I made some tools out of the mattress.
- Crafty.

16:29.062 --> 16:31.148
All right, let's get out of here.

16:37.287 --> 16:39.258
I better get in there with a jackhammer.

16:39.258 --> 16:40.924
Get to work.

16:48.986 --> 16:49.838
Lights on!

16:49.838 --> 16:53.039
Oh, we were up late watching a movie!

16:53.041 --> 16:54.741
I said, "lights on!"

17:08.921 --> 17:11.332
It's tickle time.

17:12.405 --> 17:16.148
You think you're clever,
don't you, ratting me out?

17:16.148 --> 17:18.233
Well, who's clever now, eh?

17:19.209 --> 17:21.376
That's right. Now you're feeling it.

17:21.401 --> 17:23.501
This is what we do to rats in prison.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.034
Yeah, where's the flash drive, eh?

17:25.036 --> 17:27.368
Tell me. Tell me!

17:27.371 --> 17:29.905
Tell me, you slag!

17:30.514 --> 17:32.100
Oh, my god, I killed him.

17:38.210 --> 17:40.077
Hang on.

17:42.596 --> 17:43.694
Iceberg.

17:45.921 --> 17:47.608
Where the hell are they?

17:55.525 --> 17:57.408
What the...

18:02.463 --> 18:03.604
Bloody hell.

18:12.902 --> 18:13.874
Ohh!

18:18.587 --> 18:19.919
Hey!

18:19.921 --> 18:21.240
Did you guys have a good time

18:21.240 --> 18:24.241
on your completely uneventful vacations?

18:24.242 --> 18:25.574
Deep cover.

18:25.576 --> 18:26.909
Yeah, yeah. It was fun.

18:26.911 --> 18:28.694
I ate a lot of coconut shrimp.

18:28.696 --> 18:30.362
Did you return the flash drive?

18:30.364 --> 18:32.364
I hope you brought me a souvenir!

18:32.366 --> 18:35.501
Safe and sound back at the bank.
Great work.

18:35.503 --> 18:36.869
Good to be back, Lieutenant.

18:36.871 --> 18:39.004
In prison, I hid a toothbrush
in my rectum...

18:39.029 --> 18:39.276
Shh!

18:39.276 --> 18:41.360
Vacation's over! Back to work!

18:42.306 --> 18:43.092
Hey.

18:44.702 --> 18:46.035
Just so you know,

18:46.439 --> 18:48.973
I wouldn't have gotten out
of there without you.

18:48.975 --> 18:50.433
Oh, thanks.

18:52.246 --> 18:54.696
So I guess it's just back
to work as usual, right?

18:56.027 --> 18:56.885
I don't know.

18:58.421 --> 18:59.200
Is it?

19:01.972 --> 19:02.911
I don't know.

19:05.099 --> 19:06.179
And sleep!

19:07.750 --> 19:08.651
Yes.

19:12.090 --> 19:14.865
Previously on "Angie Tribeca"...

19:14.920 --> 19:17.192
- What are we looking at, Scholls?
- Bank robbery.

19:17.247 --> 19:18.984
Damn it! That's five banks this month!

19:19.009 --> 19:21.114
Someone's going deep cover.

19:21.139 --> 19:21.947
Deep cover.

19:21.948 --> 19:24.306
Bloody hell, you got bigger cobblers den
my skin and blister, mate.

19:24.361 --> 19:25.811
Nana, Pee-Paw.

19:27.086 --> 19:27.868
Ah.

19:32.669 --> 19:34.008
Who's up for a beach day?

19:34.626 --> 19:36.125
This is all a dog's dream.

19:36.127 --> 19:38.377
People have been telling me that
since I was a kid.

19:38.379 --> 19:41.214
Prison is all about getting respect.

19:41.216 --> 19:42.381
Iceberg.

19:42.360 --> 19:43.660
We tore apart their hideout

19:43.685 --> 19:45.101
and still didn't find that flash drive.

19:45.103 --> 19:47.386
Then I'm going into prison
to get that flash drive.

19:47.388 --> 19:50.556
You seem very interested
in this flash drive.

19:50.558 --> 19:52.859
'Cause I'm going with her.

19:52.861 --> 19:54.610
I got this.

19:54.612 --> 19:55.612
Hey.

19:56.648 --> 19:58.815
Just so you know...

19:58.817 --> 20:00.366
No, no, we was all thinkin' it.
