<i>When you grow up in LA,</i>

00:02.119 --> 00:05.274
<i>real life and the movies
can get a little mixed up.</i>

00:07.817 --> 00:12.445
<i>Just ask 18-year-old
Sagittarius Penny Cooper.</i>

00:12.447 --> 00:15.114
<i>As the daughter of a
sort of famous actress,</i>

00:15.116 --> 00:17.367
<i>Penny learned the only way
to get her mom's attention</i>

00:17.369 --> 00:19.285
<i>was to film her.</i>

00:19.287 --> 00:21.246
<i>Soon, she filmed everything,</i>

00:21.248 --> 00:23.499
<i>even this cockapoo.</i>

00:25.293 --> 00:27.085
<i>Penny spent all of high school</i>

00:27.087 --> 00:31.005
<i>pining for class Casanova
Johnny Sanders Jr.</i>

00:31.007 --> 00:34.175
<i>Can you blame her? But they
were always just friends.</i>

00:34.177 --> 00:37.595
<i>Like some of us, Penny
was a late bloomer.</i>

00:37.597 --> 00:40.848
<i>Last year, when Johnny
lost his father,</i>

00:40.850 --> 00:43.184
<i>he needed a shoulder to cry on,</i>

00:43.186 --> 00:45.311
<i>and Penny was there for him.</i>

00:45.313 --> 00:48.022
<i>Romance blossomed
like a golden poppy,</i>

00:48.024 --> 00:51.192
<i>which happens to be the
California state flower.</i>

00:51.194 --> 00:52.862
<i>Is that still recording?</i>

00:54.822 --> 00:58.032
<i>But now, high school is over.</i>

00:58.034 --> 01:01.160
<i>Penny's thoughts are on
her future at Northwestern,</i>

01:01.162 --> 01:03.079
<i>but they're also on Johnny,</i>

01:03.081 --> 01:07.083
<i>and the uncertain status
of their relationship.</i>

01:07.085 --> 01:08.918
<i>What will become of them?</i>

01:08.920 --> 01:11.296
<i>Could you shut it off?
We're not the Kardashians.</i>

01:11.298 --> 01:13.214
<i>I wish I could tell her,</i>

01:13.216 --> 01:15.133
<i>"Penny, relax.</i>

01:15.135 --> 01:17.051
<i>It's all just beginning.</i>

01:17.053 --> 01:18.803
<i>You're only young once,</i>

01:18.805 --> 01:20.432

- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>And just like that...</i>

04:06.764 --> 04:09.682
- Hey, coz!
- <i>...a force blew in,</i>

04:09.684 --> 04:12.269
<i>hotter than the Santa Ana winds.</i>

04:12.937 --> 04:15.896
I'm coming.

04:15.898 --> 04:17.565
<i>Did you just fly in
from boarding school?</i>

04:17.567 --> 04:20.151
Yeah, and thank God I'm out of there.

04:20.153 --> 04:22.361
There was just something
about the energy at that place

04:22.363 --> 04:24.697
that wasn't totally right for me.

04:24.699 --> 04:26.324
Maybe it was too strict?

04:26.326 --> 04:27.366
I just felt like...

04:27.368 --> 04:31.078
the thinking there had
become too linear, you know?

04:31.080 --> 04:34.457
"Camilla, where do you see
yourself after graduation?"

04:34.459 --> 04:37.209
I don't know, that sounds like
a pretty reasonable question.

04:37.211 --> 04:40.087
Weren't you supposed to be
spending the summer in Italy?

04:40.089 --> 04:42.381
Dude, it's your mom's fault.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.882
She asked me to come here.

04:43.884 --> 04:48.012
She wants to help... brainstorm
plans for my gap year.

04:48.014 --> 04:49.763
Why is this the first
time I'm hearing about it?

04:49.765 --> 04:52.224
Maybe she wanted me to be a surprise?

04:52.226 --> 04:54.852
Or maybe she just loves you more than me.

04:54.854 --> 04:57.771
I am a lot more fun.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.088
<i>Johnny probably shouldn't
be driving a motorcycle,</i>

05:23.090 --> 05:27.760
<i>but he inherited it from his
dad after the surfing accident.</i>

05:27.762 --> 05:29.972
<i>He hasn't been in the water since.</i>

05:37.605 --> 05:41.900
<i>But now, something "excellent"
is pulling him back to the beach.</i>

05:45.405 --> 05:48.072
<i>"Johnny,</i> mi casa es su casa.

05:48.074 --> 05:50.742
<i>Make this the best
summer of your life.</i>

05:50.744 --> 05:52.161
<i>Keanu."</i>

06:12.766 --> 06:14.682
That's what you wore to prom?

06:14.684 --> 06:15.558
What's wrong with it?

06:15.560 --> 06:18.269
Well, now I understand
why you're still a virgin.

06:18.271 --> 06:20.854
Yeah, but then I thought
about it after, and I was like,

06:20.856 --> 06:23.691
why does my first time
have to be on prom anyway?

06:23.693 --> 06:25.610
It doesn't.

06:25.612 --> 06:27.945
Hello? Is Camilla here?

06:27.947 --> 06:32.199
- Aunt Faye!
- God, I've missed you!

06:32.201 --> 06:34.619
It's like having my own
daughter out of the country.

06:34.621 --> 06:36.954
- I'm right here.
- You won't believe what happened on the show today.

06:36.956 --> 06:42.503
Turns out, I'm a triplet, and
one of me is a man named Bob.

06:46.758 --> 06:47.881
Well, you look sharp.

06:47.883 --> 06:50.426
Hands off. This is for
people with money to burn

06:50.428 --> 06:52.511
on the condo I'm showing at 3:00.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.512
Well, I hope you sell it.

06:53.514 --> 06:56.849
Me too. We need this one.

06:58.227 --> 07:02.020
So, I was at Keanu's house today.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.565
Oh, yeah?

07:04.567 --> 07:06.066
How's he doing?

07:06.068 --> 07:07.860
Well, I've been meaning
to tell you, he asked me

07:07.862 --> 07:10.904
if I could house-sit for him
while he's shooting in Morocco.

07:10.906 --> 07:12.239
House-sit?

07:12.241 --> 07:14.199
He said I could invite my friends over.

07:14.201 --> 07:17.662
There's going to be plenty of food so you
wouldn't have to worry about feeding me.

07:17.664 --> 07:20.914
But you have summer school here.

07:20.916 --> 07:23.876
What are you going to do, drive from Malibu

07:23.878 --> 07:25.421
to the Valley every day?

07:31.302 --> 07:33.552
I'm not going to summer school, Mom.

07:33.554 --> 07:37.097
But if you don't get your credits,
there goes your Art Center scholarship.

07:37.099 --> 07:39.057
I have a year to get them.

07:39.059 --> 07:43.395
Does Keanu just want you to move to
the beach and spend the summer surfing?

07:43.397 --> 07:47.608
No. You don't have to worry about me.

07:47.610 --> 07:49.195
I'm not Dad.

07:52.490 --> 07:54.158
I love you.

07:55.743 --> 07:58.371
I'm gonna go pack up some of my stuff.

08:02.667 --> 08:05.044
You want to save me a cookie?

08:06.504 --> 08:08.713
<i>Meanwhile, in Tennessee,</i>

08:08.715 --> 08:11.716

08:45.501 --> 08:47.754
But what do you say we try a couple my way?

08:49.046 --> 08:50.963
With the sax?

08:50.965 --> 08:53.760
No, I told you already, kids hate sax.

08:58.347 --> 09:01.473
I'm pretty attuned to
shifts in peoples' energies,

09:01.475 --> 09:05.937
and I'm sensing a bit of hostility
flowing from you towards your mother.

09:05.939 --> 09:08.689
- She infuriates me.
- Why?

09:08.691 --> 09:11.943
I don't know, let's start with
all the boy toys she brings home

09:11.945 --> 09:14.278
after they play waiters on her show?

09:14.280 --> 09:16.572
The raging self-absorption...

09:16.574 --> 09:19.157
Hello, girls. What do you think? Am I a 10?

09:19.159 --> 09:20.745
Or an 11?

09:57.991 --> 10:00.032
Aww, cute.

10:05.957 --> 10:07.372
Is that Keanu Reeves?

10:07.374 --> 10:09.627
Yeah, he was friends with Johnny's dad.

10:10.544 --> 10:11.961
I'd still hit that.

10:25.935 --> 10:27.559
He used the word "romantic."

10:27.561 --> 10:29.645
I get why you like this guy.

10:29.647 --> 10:31.939
He wants your first time to be momentous.

10:31.941 --> 10:33.357
Well...

10:33.359 --> 10:36.735
he doesn't know it's my first time.

10:36.737 --> 10:40.823
Maybe... you should come
with, for moral support.

10:40.825 --> 10:43.369
You gotta put on your big girl swimsuit.

10:44.620 --> 10:46.662
Wait, let me see it first.

10:46.664 --> 10:49.500
You look like a nun
competing in the Olympics.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.001
Give me your scissors.

10:52.003 --> 10:54.296
Whoa, what are you doing?

11:03.681 --> 11:07.267
You sure it doesn't look too much
like a tiger tried to undress me?

11:08.310 --> 11:10.104
Mm-mm.

11:17.695 --> 11:18.986
Ready to go!

11:18.988 --> 11:22.865
And don't worry, when the time
comes and you give me the signal,

11:22.867 --> 11:24.658
I'll disappear.

11:24.660 --> 11:26.704
Like a sex ghost.

11:31.208 --> 11:32.752
Okay.

11:51.562 --> 11:54.688
I'm committing to this! I'm
doing it! I'm doing Johnny.

11:54.690 --> 11:57.691
You're making sex sound like cutting bangs.

11:57.693 --> 12:00.778
I'm gonna wait till it's moody and dark,

12:00.780 --> 12:02.320
put on a slow jam.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.281
Maybe start with a little of this...

12:04.283 --> 12:07.492
Ah, a little... a little shoulder?

12:07.494 --> 12:09.912
Why not?

12:09.914 --> 12:11.496
Okay. Okay, pull over.

12:11.498 --> 12:14.376
We have to talk about this
before you embarrass yourself.

12:19.006 --> 12:20.589
Okay.

12:20.591 --> 12:22.426
What if I hit him with this one?

12:25.638 --> 12:27.554
That's something.

12:27.556 --> 12:30.101
- Yeah?
- You want my best advice?

12:36.899 --> 12:38.107
There you go.

12:38.109 --> 12:40.358
And what? Now I like...

12:40.360 --> 12:42.277
run this down his chest or something?

12:42.279 --> 12:43.737
No, the pony's for you.

12:43.739 --> 12:46.991
You want to get your hair out of
the way for when you're, you know,

12:46.993 --> 12:48.700
- rolling around.
- Okay.

12:48.702 --> 12:50.368
So you do a lot of rolling around?

12:50.370 --> 12:51.662
I mean, you can if you want.

12:51.664 --> 12:53.831
The point is, you want to...

12:53.833 --> 12:55.749
feel comfortable and have fun.

12:55.751 --> 12:57.459
You can do that, right?

12:57.461 --> 12:59.252
So I don't have to hit him with this one?

12:59.254 --> 13:01.046
Damn!

13:01.048 --> 13:02.089
Hey!

13:02.091 --> 13:03.926
- Watch it, losers!
- Did you get it?

13:05.094 --> 13:06.468
God!

13:11.642 --> 13:14.267
So, does Johnny even know who I am?

13:14.269 --> 13:16.561
I think I may have told him the story

13:16.563 --> 13:19.023
about how you slept with your French tutor.

13:19.025 --> 13:21.150
And his girlfriend.

13:30.077 --> 13:31.451
- Hey!
- Hi.

13:31.453 --> 13:35.080
I hope you don't mind, I
invited my cousin, Camilla.

13:35.082 --> 13:37.168
Your cousin?

13:37.877 --> 13:39.294
Howdy, cowboy.

13:40.546 --> 13:42.379
Is this the one you said was such a flake?

13:42.381 --> 13:44.089
I heard that!

13:44.091 --> 13:46.258
- Thanks a lot.
- I'm sorry.

13:46.260 --> 13:50.137
Somebody call a doctor,
because this house is sick!

13:55.895 --> 13:58.979
Holy shi...

14:10.492 --> 14:13.244
<i>What Penny didn't tell
Camilla about prom night</i>

14:13.246 --> 14:17.539
<i>is that her nerves got the best
of her, and the moment passed.</i>

14:17.541 --> 14:19.833
<i>But now she finds herself here,</i>

14:19.835 --> 14:23.087
<i>standing on Keanu Reeves'
deck overlooking the Pacific,</i>

14:23.089 --> 14:24.963
<i>ready for her second chance.</i>

14:24.965 --> 14:26.383
Hey, Penn.

14:27.593 --> 14:28.928
That's some swimsuit.

14:29.720 --> 14:31.803
Thanks.

14:31.805 --> 14:33.138
It's new, kind of.

14:33.140 --> 14:36.474
Well, you look beautiful.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.812
So do you think you're going
to surf while you're out here?

14:42.024 --> 14:44.066
Hey, humans.

14:44.068 --> 14:46.279
Hey. Do you guys want smoothies?

14:47.113 --> 14:48.781
Sounds good.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.490
Um, hello?

14:52.492 --> 14:54.787
Put the camera away.

14:56.705 --> 14:59.959
Be present in the actual world.

15:06.173 --> 15:07.256
Virgin daiquiris.

15:07.258 --> 15:08.506
- Thank you.
- Oh.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.761
- Fitting.
- Huh?

15:14.265 --> 15:17.724
Isn't this relaxing? I
could just lay here all year.

15:17.726 --> 15:21.312
Yeah, I don't think Northwestern is
going to let you major in house-sitting.

15:21.314 --> 15:23.188
Is that where you're going to?

15:23.190 --> 15:25.983
Me, Northwestern?

15:25.985 --> 15:28.819
Nah. Not smart enough.

15:28.821 --> 15:31.404
You're smart. There's just
different kinds of smart.

15:31.406 --> 15:33.657
He is a great artist.

15:33.659 --> 15:35.242
But I don't know if I should do that.

15:35.244 --> 15:37.286
I mean, a year ago, I
wanted to be a pro surfer.

15:37.288 --> 15:40.205
So maybe art school's
just a way of buying time.

15:40.207 --> 15:42.040
Mmm. Why do you have to decide now?

15:42.042 --> 15:46.044
Because my mom's on my ass? Because
I'm expected to do something?

15:46.046 --> 15:48.922
At least she cares, right?

15:48.924 --> 15:52.634
So, what do you think you'll do next year?

15:52.636 --> 15:55.012
I had to grow up pretty fast
with my parents shipping me off

15:55.014 --> 15:57.181
to boarding school as a kid, so...

15:57.183 --> 15:59.852
I actually want to slow down for a second.

16:02.646 --> 16:04.190
Well, cheers to that.

16:08.861 --> 16:11.862
So, that disco ball just gave me an idea...

16:11.864 --> 16:13.490
Prom do-over?

16:14.825 --> 16:16.574
I think I still have my prom dress

16:16.576 --> 16:18.743
in the bottom of my bag.

16:18.745 --> 16:21.830
I could borrow something of Keanu's.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.088
Oh!

16:30.090 --> 16:33.633
Honey, you're so beautiful. I'm so proud.

16:33.635 --> 16:36.638
Thanks, Mom. I love your Botox.

16:37.931 --> 16:39.597
Now what am I gonna wear?

16:44.521 --> 16:46.646
Silk sheets.

16:46.648 --> 16:48.606
<i>Hey.</i>

16:48.608 --> 16:51.320
Did I tie this right? Does it look okay?

16:55.282 --> 16:58.825
- There. You look sharp.
- Thanks.

16:58.827 --> 17:01.745
So, it's a big night for you and Penn.

17:01.747 --> 17:02.787
Mmm. What did she say?

17:02.789 --> 17:05.207
Oh, you know, nothing, but, um...

17:05.209 --> 17:07.666
- if you want my advice?
- Do I?

17:07.669 --> 17:10.212
She's going to require some wooing.

17:10.214 --> 17:11.422
You know, be poetic.

17:11.424 --> 17:13.424
And pay attention to her earlobes.

17:13.425 --> 17:15.550
They're an erogenous zone.

17:15.551 --> 17:17.386
I didn't know that Penny
came with instructions.

17:17.387 --> 17:19.762
Hmm. Then you must not know her that well.

17:27.606 --> 17:29.942
My baby's all grown up.

18:22.577 --> 18:25.662
<i>Be cool, Penny. Act
like you're in a movie.</i>

18:29.042 --> 18:31.293
I'm dying for some guacamole.

18:31.295 --> 18:34.381
I guess I'll go whip some up.

19:19.009 --> 19:20.091
I'm a virgin.

19:20.093 --> 19:21.634
Say what?

19:21.636 --> 19:23.136
I just wanted to be honest with you.

19:23.138 --> 19:24.971
But don't worry. It's not
like I expect you to hold me

19:24.973 --> 19:27.391
for 48 hours after or anything.

19:27.393 --> 19:29.476
I just wanted you to know.

19:29.478 --> 19:32.645
Okay. Well, is there anything else

19:32.647 --> 19:34.316
that you really want me to know?

19:36.026 --> 19:38.818
Glow in the dark? Or...

19:38.820 --> 19:40.445
tingly-warm?

19:40.447 --> 19:42.449
You are so prepared.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.991
I mean...

19:44.993 --> 19:47.578
in a sexy way.

19:47.580 --> 19:50.914
And I really like your earlobes.

20:08.225 --> 20:09.602
Hmm.

20:12.062 --> 20:13.897
Hello!

20:16.358 --> 20:18.235
Where did you come from?

20:25.117 --> 20:27.035
What's up?

20:58.775 --> 21:01.151
So how was it, champ?

21:01.153 --> 21:03.278
How was it? How was it? How was it?

21:03.280 --> 21:04.529
How was it? How was it?

21:06.825 --> 21:09.159
- It was good.
- Mmm.

21:09.161 --> 21:11.119
<i>I mean, we were very naked,</i>

21:11.121 --> 21:13.871
<i>and it was definitely
kind of awkward,</i>

21:13.873 --> 21:15.039
<i>but he was sweet.</i>

21:15.041 --> 21:16.667
<i>Did you see where he went?</i>

21:16.669 --> 21:19.296
<i>I think he was heading out to surf.</i>

21:39.441 --> 21:41.065
Yo, yo, yo, dude!

21:41.067 --> 21:43.109
Hey, yo! Kenny G!

21:43.111 --> 21:45.197
The tide's coming in! Let's go!

21:51.828 --> 21:53.453
<i>Yo, dude. We got a complaint.</i>

21:53.455 --> 21:57.582
<i>Some kid parked his van overnight
just north of El Matador.</i>

21:57.584 --> 22:00.335
<i>Tennessee plates.</i>

22:00.337 --> 22:02.797
Sounds like a camper. I'll go check it out.

22:08.387 --> 22:12.639
This is a big deal. He hasn't
gone out since his dad died.

22:12.641 --> 22:13.640
Who's he with?

22:13.642 --> 22:16.309
Maybe it's the naked guy I saw last night!

22:16.311 --> 22:17.686
Naked guy?

22:17.688 --> 22:20.190
Naked... and wet.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.572
Is that your van parked up
there on private property?

22:28.574 --> 22:30.615
Is it not supposed to be there?

22:30.617 --> 22:33.744
I'm really sorry. I drove
all the way from Tennessee...

22:33.746 --> 22:35.787
I've got to issue a citation
for unlawful camping.

22:35.789 --> 22:37.372
Man, cut the guy a little slack.

22:37.374 --> 22:39.666
Johnny.

22:39.668 --> 22:42.168
I can't believe they
let you be a lifeguard.

22:42.170 --> 22:45.088
- Is there trouble?
- Get that out of my face.

22:45.090 --> 22:47.006
And, you, with the saxophone,
I'm gonna need some ID.

22:47.008 --> 22:49.801
It makes me so sad that we as a society

22:49.803 --> 22:52.387
are still so inflexible
about public nudity.

22:52.389 --> 22:55.599
What nudity? I'm writing him up for
having a sleepover on state property.

22:55.601 --> 22:58.268
I swear, I didn't know you
couldn't camp on the beach.

22:58.270 --> 23:00.937
- But whose beach is it really?
- California's.

23:00.939 --> 23:03.690
Isn't that just what we've been told?

23:03.692 --> 23:06.818
I mean, California is a
concept. It's a way of saying,

23:06.820 --> 23:08.779
"We're not Nevada, and thank God for that."

23:08.781 --> 23:10.488
That's a fascinating perspective, but...

23:10.490 --> 23:12.282
When I come home from a day at the shore

23:12.284 --> 23:15.034
and I've got sand in my
bikini crotch, am I...

23:15.036 --> 23:17.704
stealing from state property, sir?

23:17.706 --> 23:19.247
Okay, cool it with the "sir."

23:19.249 --> 23:21.833
Yet, this young man,
who lies upon said sand,

23:21.835 --> 23:24.210
is somehow threatening
your concept of ownership?

23:24.212 --> 23:26.590
Do you want a citation too?

23:27.924 --> 23:29.173
I'll make it a warning.

23:29.175 --> 23:32.135
And my Gram says there
are no good people in LA.

23:32.137 --> 23:33.553
Just move the van.

23:33.555 --> 23:35.930
You can park it in the
driveway. I'll show you.

23:35.932 --> 23:38.226
- For real?
- Yeah. Come on.

23:40.353 --> 23:42.061
I really like lifeguards.

23:42.063 --> 23:44.274
You're like the sons of Poseidon.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.168
Hi, boys.

24:06.463 --> 24:08.423
Was that Pamela Anderson?

24:10.091 --> 24:11.844
Welcome to Malibu.

24:15.305 --> 24:17.221
You live here?

24:17.223 --> 24:19.932
Nah, just house-sitting.

24:19.934 --> 24:22.185
Why were you sleeping on the beach, dude?

24:22.187 --> 24:25.313
Uh, short story is, I
wanted to find myself.

24:25.315 --> 24:27.482
Something compelled me to look out here.

24:27.484 --> 24:30.360
The first sight of the ocean and...

24:30.362 --> 24:32.111
I don't know how else to explain it.

24:32.113 --> 24:34.032
It's just where I need to be.

24:35.450 --> 24:37.160
I know the feeling.

24:39.913 --> 24:41.454
<i>...property, sir?</i>

24:41.456 --> 24:43.080
<i>Okay, cool it with the "sir."</i>

24:43.082 --> 24:44.582
<i>Yet, this young man,</i>

24:44.584 --> 24:45.958
<i>who lies upon said sand...</i>

24:45.960 --> 24:47.585
Hey, this is, uh, Ash.

24:47.587 --> 24:50.046
- He's gonna hang out for a while.
- Hey.

24:50.048 --> 24:52.757
Thanks for helping me out back there.

24:52.759 --> 24:55.092
- Namaste.
- God bless.

24:55.094 --> 24:56.930
Johnny, wait up.

24:58.807 --> 25:00.891
Hey. I saw you with your board.

25:00.893 --> 25:02.350
Is everything okay?

25:02.352 --> 25:04.728
- Were you gonna go surf?
- I just... I just need a minute.

25:04.730 --> 25:06.563
- And about last night...
- I know. Can we...

25:06.565 --> 25:08.775
Can we just talk about this later?

25:10.527 --> 25:12.360
<i>All she wanted to say</i>

25:12.362 --> 25:14.656
<i>was that she was glad it was him.</i>

25:16.700 --> 25:18.658
So it kind of looked like
you were giving yourself

25:18.660 --> 25:21.202
a sexy baptism last night.

25:21.204 --> 25:23.914
Uh, not a sexy baptism.

25:23.916 --> 25:27.834
Just the regular ol' baptism.

25:27.836 --> 25:30.086
- Are you being serious?
- Yeah.

25:30.088 --> 25:32.338
I thought it was the perfect time

25:32.340 --> 25:34.674
to renew my faith in the Lord.

25:34.676 --> 25:37.468
If... I knew I had an audience,

25:37.470 --> 25:41.266
I probably would've worn pants.

25:42.058 --> 25:43.641
You're religious.

25:43.643 --> 25:45.435
I take it you're not.

25:45.437 --> 25:49.272
Let's just say, I operate from this...

25:49.274 --> 25:53.276
awareness that we're all just these...

25:53.278 --> 25:57.071
tiny little specks on
this rotating spaceship.

25:57.073 --> 25:59.657
I don't mean to be
disrespectful, but then...

25:59.659 --> 26:02.452
what is the difference between

26:02.454 --> 26:05.705
spirituality and... astronomy?

26:05.707 --> 26:07.041
Found him!

26:08.293 --> 26:10.460
Steve! The lifeguard.

26:10.462 --> 26:11.628
We wanted to find him?

26:11.630 --> 26:14.299
I was pretty happy to see him go.

26:16.384 --> 26:18.802
You noticed how weird
Johnny's been acting, right?

26:18.804 --> 26:21.220
Well, I knew there had to be a story.

26:21.222 --> 26:25.433
So, I googled "Steve,
lifeguard, Malibu, rude,"

26:25.435 --> 26:29.312
but it wasn't until I added Johnny's
dad's name into the mix that I found this.

26:29.314 --> 26:31.689
"Professional surfer Steve Galmarini

26:31.691 --> 26:35.067
has received a three-year
suspension after testing positive

26:35.069 --> 26:36.694
for performance-enhancing drugs.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.655
He is the first athlete to be suspended

26:38.657 --> 26:41.240
under the World Surf League's
new drug testing guidelines."

26:41.242 --> 26:45.578
That guy doesn't need
'roids, he needs a chill pill.

26:45.580 --> 26:48.122
It says that Johnny's dad
was Steve's first coach.

26:48.124 --> 26:50.917
But there was some kind of falling out.

26:50.919 --> 26:52.877
What if it was over the drugs?

26:52.879 --> 26:54.838
It says here that some people think

26:54.840 --> 26:57.131
Johnny's dad died on that
wave because he was out there

26:57.133 --> 27:01.093
trying to win back the community's
respect after the drug scandal.

27:01.095 --> 27:03.554
Yikes.

27:03.556 --> 27:06.432
I can't believe he didn't tell me this.

27:08.561 --> 27:10.355
I'll get it.

27:14.026 --> 27:15.817
There's something I have to give you.

27:15.819 --> 27:17.487
I don't want anything from you.

27:22.701 --> 27:25.535
I remember my dad wearing that.

27:25.537 --> 27:27.912
He got it on a surfing trip in Bali.

27:27.914 --> 27:31.791
It's supposed to protect
you from, like, yourself.

27:31.793 --> 27:34.251
Everyone was talking about
him, putting him on a pedestal,

27:34.253 --> 27:37.924
but... he never bought into it.

27:45.390 --> 27:48.558
I wasn't at your dad's memorial because...

27:48.560 --> 27:50.476
he didn't need the embarrassment.

27:50.478 --> 27:53.065
But that doesn't mean I wasn't gutted.

27:55.608 --> 27:57.525
There's something else too.

27:57.527 --> 27:59.569
Marianas waves are hitting
the cove tomorrow afternoon.

27:59.571 --> 28:01.489
You wanna come out?

28:02.657 --> 28:04.323
I gave up surfing.

28:04.325 --> 28:07.412
I'm leaving the marina at
2:00. You should really come.

28:10.248 --> 28:12.500
Bring your wackjob friends too.

28:30.018 --> 28:32.143
Is this the only color you have?

28:32.145 --> 28:35.646
Sorry, I left the purple
polka-dotted ones back at my place.

28:35.648 --> 28:37.065
I'm gonna guess you're virgins?

28:37.067 --> 28:40.526
No! And that's really
none of your business.

28:40.528 --> 28:44.488
Oh, you're talking about surfing. Hah!

28:44.490 --> 28:46.367
Penn, did you bring any sunscreen?

28:52.832 --> 28:55.792
SPF-18.

28:55.794 --> 28:57.293
You know Icarus, right?

28:57.295 --> 28:58.753
He's that dude you met in the Alps?

28:58.755 --> 29:02.132
Icarus is the guy whose
wings were made of wax,

29:02.134 --> 29:05.093
but then he flew too close
to the sun, and they melted.

29:05.095 --> 29:07.511
And then he fell into the Aegean Sea,

29:07.513 --> 29:09.223
and he died.

29:10.683 --> 29:12.060
Cool story, dude.

29:15.605 --> 29:18.148
One, two, three.

29:18.150 --> 29:19.398
Perfect.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.025
When you're out there,
you don't want to force

29:21.027 --> 29:22.152
your will on the waves.

29:22.154 --> 29:23.820
You want to accept
whatever they're giving you.

29:23.822 --> 29:26.156
Hard to believe you're
still spouting that crap.

29:26.158 --> 29:27.907
It's all scientific.

29:27.909 --> 29:29.867
Waves aren't just water, they're energy

29:29.869 --> 29:33.163
generated from thousands of miles away.

29:33.165 --> 29:35.247
And the waves we're riding
today were started by an eruption

29:35.249 --> 29:36.166
in the Marianas Trench...

29:36.168 --> 29:38.835
the deepest known spot on the planet.

29:38.837 --> 29:42.296
The whole "one with the wave"
thing is a waste of time.

29:42.298 --> 29:45.800
You have to impose yourself on
them. That's what my dad taught me.

29:45.802 --> 29:48.552
Your dad taught me that
surfing's like making love...

29:48.554 --> 29:50.387
it feels good no matter how you do it.

29:50.389 --> 29:54.892
I'm ready to absorb some primal
energy from the Earth's core.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.437
Far out.

30:06.405 --> 30:10.324
<i>Believe me, being pissed
off will get you nowhere,</i>

30:10.326 --> 30:14.204
<i>and Johnny has spent a lot
of time being pissed off.</i>

30:14.206 --> 30:16.413
<i>Mostly at the ocean
for taking his father.</i>

30:16.415 --> 30:23.004
<i>But deep down, he also knows that surfing is
the best way to honor his father's legacy.</i>

30:23.006 --> 30:26.509
<i>So, the only thing left
to do is to paddle out.</i>

31:26.819 --> 31:28.360
Look at Johnny over there.

31:28.362 --> 31:31.574
He should get grounded on a
longboard, like his dad did.

31:32.700 --> 31:34.160
Maybe he will.

31:37.371 --> 31:40.164
All right. Our turn. Ready?

31:40.166 --> 31:43.211
Paddle. Paddle, paddle, paddle, paddle!

31:45.130 --> 31:46.589
Ah!

31:51.636 --> 31:55.138
Hey! You're not connecting with your board.

31:55.140 --> 31:56.641
You're not my coach.

32:08.320 --> 32:10.363
Oh, my God, you're bleeding.

32:11.281 --> 32:12.949
Let me get you something.

32:17.870 --> 32:19.662
You carry Neosporin?

32:19.664 --> 32:21.707
I grew up being my own mother.

32:25.962 --> 32:27.086
- Oh.
- Ow.

32:27.088 --> 32:28.881
- Watch it.
- Sorry.

33:07.586 --> 33:10.963
<i>Johnny's gonna find
his sea legs again,</i>

33:10.965 --> 33:13.343
<i>he just has to figure out how.</i>

33:19.098 --> 33:21.224
What do you need, chef?

33:21.226 --> 33:23.100
Oh, more honey, honey.

33:23.102 --> 33:25.144
I thought you were making tacos?

33:25.146 --> 33:27.023
Just trust.

33:29.608 --> 33:31.442
- Where's Johnny?
- Napping.

33:31.444 --> 33:33.238
He said he'd meet us at dinner.

33:38.743 --> 33:40.453
I just wanted you to know I love you.

33:42.663 --> 33:43.998
Hello?

33:45.666 --> 33:47.417
Hello?

33:47.419 --> 33:48.584
Agh.

33:48.586 --> 33:50.546
Was that your girlfriend back in Tennessee?

33:51.339 --> 33:53.172
It was my grandma.

33:53.174 --> 33:54.590
Yeah, right.

33:54.592 --> 33:55.968
True story.

33:57.262 --> 33:58.677
You play all these?

33:58.679 --> 34:00.637
Uh, little bit here and there,

34:00.639 --> 34:02.639
for quick cash.

34:02.641 --> 34:05.393
I might go play at the pier tomorrow.

34:05.395 --> 34:08.353
Are you, like, some kind of
musical genius on the run?

34:08.356 --> 34:10.606
Something like that.

34:10.608 --> 34:12.983
How cryptic.

34:12.985 --> 34:16.489
Well, I guess I'm just
trying to start over.

34:17.239 --> 34:18.489
It feels like...

34:18.491 --> 34:20.699
going backward to talk about anything

34:20.701 --> 34:22.411
from the past, you know?

34:23.621 --> 34:25.746
Yeah, I'm happier as a lifeguard.

34:25.748 --> 34:27.748
I am.

34:27.750 --> 34:29.708
I had a moment where I tried drugs,

34:29.710 --> 34:32.128
but they kind of made me hate myself.

34:32.130 --> 34:33.254
Completely.

34:33.255 --> 34:36.715
It wasn't like I was doping to
surf better or anything like that.

34:36.717 --> 34:40.469
It was more that steroids
made me aggressive out there.

34:40.472 --> 34:43.475
Johnny's dad begged me to
stop using, so I fired him.

34:44.809 --> 34:46.434
That's when everything went bad.

34:50.148 --> 34:53.565
Why do you record everything?

34:53.567 --> 34:55.359
Sometimes things feel more real on video

34:55.360 --> 34:57.238
than they do in real life, you know?

34:58.406 --> 34:59.696
Sure.

34:59.698 --> 35:02.408
I feel that way about songs.

35:02.410 --> 35:05.202
I find myself thinking, you know,

35:05.204 --> 35:07.413
"That song is more true

35:07.415 --> 35:11.167
than back when the thing I'm singing about

35:11.169 --> 35:12.586
actually happened."

35:13.463 --> 35:15.256
- You know?
- Yeah.

35:22.888 --> 35:24.682
Is that your favorite instrument?

35:26.142 --> 35:28.311
I'd play it for you, but...

35:30.896 --> 35:32.896
Or...

35:32.898 --> 35:34.190
you could play it for me.

35:34.192 --> 35:36.526
No. I don't play.

35:36.528 --> 35:38.319
They took the triangle away from me

35:38.321 --> 35:40.573
when I was in kindergarten
because I hit it too hard.

35:42.658 --> 35:44.867
I'll finger, you blow.

35:51.167 --> 35:53.209
I think the perfect situation

35:53.211 --> 35:55.586
is you get two houses
right next to each other,

35:55.588 --> 35:58.381
and you live in one, and your
partner lives in the other.

35:58.383 --> 36:02.051
Then you can be intimate
without being codependent.

36:02.053 --> 36:05.762
I think if you need two houses,
you've picked the wrong person.

36:05.764 --> 36:09.058
But what if it's a huge house like this?

36:09.060 --> 36:13.312
A couple could live
here and still be lonely.

36:13.314 --> 36:14.938
No, the house doesn't matter.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.568
You could fail anywhere.

36:17.318 --> 36:19.527
My parents...

36:19.529 --> 36:23.822
they're gone now... they used to say,

36:23.824 --> 36:25.991
you can choose not to fail.

36:25.993 --> 36:29.328
Come on. You can refuse to
accept failure in yourself.

36:29.330 --> 36:31.955
But in a relationship?

36:31.957 --> 36:34.500
You don't know what's gonna
happen to the other person.

36:34.502 --> 36:38.170
I'm honestly more worried
that I'll fail myself.

36:38.172 --> 36:42.633
My partner can figure
him-slash-herself out.

36:42.635 --> 36:44.676
When you lie in bed awake at night,

36:44.678 --> 36:46.929
there's nothing you picture
yourself doing when you grow up?

36:46.931 --> 36:50.391
I hear that phrase "when you grow up"

36:50.393 --> 36:52.184
and I just go blank.

36:52.186 --> 36:53.477
You don't think I'm grown up?

36:55.314 --> 36:57.356
That's not true, though, because...

36:57.358 --> 36:59.024
you were just talking
about the tandem houses.

36:59.026 --> 37:01.654
So there's something brewing
in that head of yours.

37:03.030 --> 37:05.948
Place an older version
of yourself in the house.

37:05.950 --> 37:07.159
How old are you?

37:08.578 --> 37:10.246
Sixty-one...

37:11.497 --> 37:14.540
and I'm wearing this super chic caftan

37:14.542 --> 37:16.628
with these big gold hoops.

37:18.212 --> 37:20.756
Now... what are you thinking?

37:22.049 --> 37:23.926
That I miss being young.

37:25.970 --> 37:28.431
How about some music, huh, Penn?

37:31.601 --> 37:33.060
"Penn"?

37:55.583 --> 37:57.376
I can't hear you!

39:31.679 --> 39:33.303
Did Johnny just up and go to bed?

39:33.305 --> 39:35.723
Here, just leave 'em. I'll
finish up. Go check on him.

39:35.725 --> 39:37.851
- Thank you.
- No worries.

39:43.148 --> 39:44.856
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

39:44.858 --> 39:47.443
<i>Are you okay? I'm getting worried.</i>

39:47.445 --> 39:50.654
<i>Call me if you want. You
know I'm here for you, okay?</i>

39:50.656 --> 39:52.199
<i>Bye.</i>

40:08.716 --> 40:10.257
Hey.

40:10.259 --> 40:12.718
You're not planning on sleeping
out here again, are you?

40:12.720 --> 40:14.762
Yeah.

40:14.764 --> 40:17.767
I don't want to impose,
more than I already have.

40:19.101 --> 40:21.268
There's more than enough room in the house.

40:21.270 --> 40:23.564
I'm sure Johnny would be cool with it.

40:25.566 --> 40:27.858
Aren't you two together?

40:27.860 --> 40:32.904
There was something going on, but
it was always just a "something."

40:32.906 --> 40:36.201
I chalked that up to him
needing more space, but...

40:36.910 --> 40:38.869
that's not it.

40:38.871 --> 40:42.583
Uh, I don't think that
he wants space from you.

40:44.627 --> 40:46.168
Honestly?

40:46.170 --> 40:49.465
I think he just doesn't want to
go through losing somebody else.

40:52.426 --> 40:54.011
I like you.

40:55.680 --> 40:59.057
So even if there's just a... "something,"

41:00.058 --> 41:02.603
you have to sort it out.

41:03.395 --> 41:05.022
You know?

41:05.690 --> 41:07.230
Okay.

41:07.232 --> 41:10.693
- Aw!
- Okay, that was bad. Try again, try again!

41:10.695 --> 41:12.110
- Oh!
- Yes!

41:13.071 --> 41:15.947
- I'm going to bed.
- So early?

41:15.949 --> 41:17.284
Good night.

41:19.662 --> 41:21.370
<i>Love is crazy.</i>

41:21.372 --> 41:25.791
<i>How is it possible to feel so distant
from a guy you just slept with?</i>

41:25.793 --> 41:28.420
<i>And so close to a guy you just met?</i>

41:29.421 --> 41:31.046
<i>Oh, Penny, Penny.</i>

41:31.048 --> 41:32.882
<i>My two cents?</i>

41:32.884 --> 41:34.468
<i>Follow your heart.</i>

41:47.981 --> 41:49.690
Penny.

41:49.692 --> 41:52.984
Wake up, lady! Rise and shine!

41:52.986 --> 41:55.404
You've got to learn some morning etiquette.

41:55.406 --> 41:57.907
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's go into town.

41:57.909 --> 41:59.491
I want to go look at wet suits.

41:59.493 --> 42:03.036
I think I might start getting into surfing.

42:03.038 --> 42:05.288
I think Ash was planning
on busking at the pier.

42:05.290 --> 42:07.042
Maybe we can go there after?

42:07.877 --> 42:10.252
Did Johnny never come home?

42:10.254 --> 42:11.587
Nope.

42:11.589 --> 42:13.465
He never answered any of my calls.

42:49.167 --> 42:51.001
Can I help you?

42:51.003 --> 42:53.169
What's with all the Goth wetsuits?

42:53.171 --> 42:55.923
It's like, have the balls to wear something

42:55.925 --> 42:58.467
that reflects your
personal style, you know?

42:58.469 --> 43:00.471
Personal style is for your board.

43:02.014 --> 43:04.099
These speak to me.

43:04.976 --> 43:06.224
Thanks.

43:06.226 --> 43:08.518
I put my heart into each
and every one of them.

43:08.520 --> 43:11.064
- You made these?
- Sure did.

43:18.530 --> 43:22.992

43:44.389 --> 43:46.890
Oh, those old things?

43:46.892 --> 43:48.809
I don't know.

43:48.811 --> 43:51.102
Let's see that gun.

43:51.104 --> 43:56.652

44:32.980 --> 44:36.901

44:40.195 --> 44:41.737
Would you look at that?

44:41.739 --> 44:43.279
It's art.

44:43.281 --> 44:45.741
Whoa!

44:45.743 --> 44:47.870
That suit is awesome.

44:50.706 --> 44:52.748
<i>♪ Me and this guitar ♪</i>

44:52.750 --> 44:58.380
<i>♪ Are gonna find me

44:59.172 --> 45:00.340
There you are.

45:02.217 --> 45:04.175
Creativity is so exhausting.

45:04.177 --> 45:06.887
I'm gonna have to take a power
nap before my surf lesson later.

45:06.889 --> 45:08.847
Here.

45:08.849 --> 45:12.809
You take my car, and I'll
get a ride home with Ash.

45:12.811 --> 45:14.146
Ash, huh?

45:14.897 --> 45:16.648
What?

45:28.660 --> 45:30.827
You're back.

45:30.829 --> 45:33.124
Yeah, I had some stuff
I had to take care of.

45:33.999 --> 45:35.665
What are you up to?

45:35.667 --> 45:37.084
I was gonna take a nap,

45:37.086 --> 45:39.252
but then I, like, stopped being tired.

45:39.254 --> 45:42.049
Salt air is magic like that.

45:49.723 --> 45:52.225
So why'd you take off last night?

45:54.269 --> 45:57.896
I just had a lot of stuff on my mind.

45:57.898 --> 45:59.731
And things got kind of weird with Penny.

45:59.733 --> 46:03.693
You guys have known each other
for a long time now, right?

46:03.695 --> 46:06.490
She really helped take care of
me when my dad died last year.

46:08.784 --> 46:10.700
We're pretty different, you know?

46:10.702 --> 46:13.205
I mean, things change. It's nobody's fault.

46:15.332 --> 46:17.874
It's beautiful.

46:17.876 --> 46:20.502
I was up all last night on
Zuma trying to figure out

46:20.504 --> 46:24.047
whether I should go back to surfing
or throw myself into art school.

46:24.049 --> 46:27.178
Maybe the problem is that you were awake.

46:28.012 --> 46:28.844
What?

46:28.846 --> 46:31.223
Have you ever heard of lucid dreaming?

46:36.187 --> 46:38.937
I'm gonna wake up your
conscious mind during your dream,

46:38.939 --> 46:41.523
but your body's gonna stay asleep.

46:41.525 --> 46:43.817
You sure this isn't just the
plot of <i>The Matrix?</i>

46:45.320 --> 46:47.237
Shut your eyes and relax.

46:47.239 --> 46:50.949
You'll receive a signal
from me when you're asleep.

46:50.951 --> 46:54.077
A tap on your nose...
that'll be the trigger, okay?

46:54.079 --> 46:55.787
Now...

46:55.789 --> 46:58.792
let yourself drift.

47:03.047 --> 47:04.963
I didn't suck, did I?

47:04.965 --> 47:06.756
You were amazing.

47:06.758 --> 47:08.675
Do you need me to carry anything for you?

47:08.677 --> 47:09.968
That hat full of money, perhaps?

47:09.970 --> 47:13.807
Well, I don't know if I trust
you with my life savings just yet.

47:15.893 --> 47:17.269
God, that felt good.

47:18.729 --> 47:20.353
Been a while.

47:20.355 --> 47:23.106
Just wish Grams was here to see that one.

47:23.108 --> 47:25.942
Well, then I have happy news for you.

47:25.944 --> 47:28.070
Did you fly Gram out, hide
her behind the trashcan?

47:28.072 --> 47:31.656
- No, but I filmed it.
- 'Course you did.

47:31.658 --> 47:32.824
But good luck getting it to her.

47:32.826 --> 47:36.036
Unless your camera converts files to VHS.

47:36.038 --> 47:37.662
She doesn't even have e-mail.

47:37.664 --> 47:40.498
- Not even AOL?
- Not even AOL.

47:41.793 --> 47:44.794
Well, all she's got to
do is look on YouTube.

47:44.796 --> 47:47.964
You didn't put the video up?

47:47.966 --> 47:49.925
And my Instagram. Not to get braggy,

47:49.927 --> 47:53.428
but I do have a lot of followers
because of my crazy mom.

47:53.430 --> 47:56.681
But now I can finally use
them for good... for you.

47:56.683 --> 48:00.518
I posted it an hour ago, and I already
have eleven hundred likes on it!

48:00.520 --> 48:02.812
- Penny...
- I know. I know,

48:02.814 --> 48:07.817
you're secretive about your life, but this
could be a major boost for your career.

48:07.819 --> 48:10.361
You don't know anything about my career!

48:10.363 --> 48:15.825
You can't just insert yourself
into people's business like that.

48:15.827 --> 48:18.120
- Just trying to help.
- Yeah, well, you just opened me up

48:18.122 --> 48:20.415
to a whole mess of trouble.

48:23.752 --> 48:26.171
- Ash!
- Take it all down.

48:27.131 --> 48:28.632
You didn't have the right.

48:42.229 --> 48:43.813
<i>I'm dreaming.</i>

49:13.051 --> 49:14.676
Can I fly with you?

50:35.092 --> 50:36.716
What did you see?

50:36.718 --> 50:38.178
I've got it!

50:44.976 --> 50:49.687
Is that the final step in lucid dreaming?

50:49.689 --> 50:52.650
No, that was an actual real-time kiss.

50:54.069 --> 50:55.777
Because?

50:55.779 --> 50:57.653
Because it felt like we had this vibe.

50:57.655 --> 51:01.532
You get "vibes" with every
living, breathing person you meet.

51:01.534 --> 51:03.493
Right?

51:03.495 --> 51:08.164
I hope you're not suggesting that I
should feel bad about being myself?

51:08.166 --> 51:11.626
No, it's just hard to take you seriously.

51:11.628 --> 51:13.880
You're not really that kind of person.

51:14.589 --> 51:17.008
Gee... thanks.

51:19.219 --> 51:20.720
Camilla, wait.

51:21.930 --> 51:23.930
Camilla!

51:26.310 --> 51:28.019
Jesus, I'm an idiot.

51:29.187 --> 51:30.686
I was just got sent this from a friend

51:30.688 --> 51:32.355
who says we should look
into signing this kid.

51:38.113 --> 51:40.198
Who's this person who posted it?

51:41.658 --> 51:43.868
Send a cease and desist.
And you find that kid.

51:44.577 --> 51:46.455
Now.

51:57.715 --> 51:59.424
Whoa, check the suit!

51:59.426 --> 52:02.595
Hey. Yeah, I made it myself.

52:04.389 --> 52:06.639
What's going on?

52:06.641 --> 52:08.808
Do you take me seriously?

52:08.810 --> 52:12.521
As a surfer? Look, you just
started. It takes years to...

52:12.523 --> 52:14.483
No, as... as a person.

52:15.442 --> 52:17.400
Sure I do.

52:17.402 --> 52:19.110
You're smart.

52:19.112 --> 52:22.866
And you have this mellow open-mindedness,
and you're way easy to talk to.

52:28.955 --> 52:31.166
Why? Who doesn't take you seriously?

52:32.209 --> 52:34.083
Johnny, for starters.

52:34.085 --> 52:35.710
Johnny's a tough one.

52:35.712 --> 52:37.381
He always has been.

52:38.549 --> 52:41.090
Yeah, and Penny too.

52:41.092 --> 52:44.260
I mean, she thinks I'm a flake.

52:44.262 --> 52:46.555
Like, I can't stick with anything.

52:46.557 --> 52:48.681
You showed up today.

52:48.683 --> 52:52.310
- I just kissed her boyfriend.
- Okay. Whoa.

52:52.312 --> 52:55.148
Which makes me a flake and an attempted...

52:56.608 --> 52:59.526
homewrecker?

52:59.528 --> 53:02.820
When you're out there waiting,
you can tie yourself up into knots,

53:02.822 --> 53:04.989
trying to figure out what
moves you're gonna pull.

53:04.991 --> 53:08.034
But once you get on the wave,
everything becomes pretty simple.

53:08.036 --> 53:10.622
You know who you are. You know what to do.

53:12.624 --> 53:14.374
What if they hate me?

53:14.376 --> 53:16.209
Just face up to how you feel.

53:16.211 --> 53:20.589
And to your cousin. And if you have a
thing for Johnny, face up to him too.

53:20.591 --> 53:23.843
Stop dodging yourself. It
only makes things worse.

53:25.596 --> 53:27.720
Have you ever considered being a therapist?

53:27.722 --> 53:31.266
Can I get one of those
wet suits as payment?

53:55.917 --> 53:59.502
You're destroying your dad's board?

53:59.504 --> 54:02.549
No. I'm just making it my own.

54:03.550 --> 54:05.135
I hope you're okay with that.

54:06.052 --> 54:08.470
Is it an art project, or...

54:08.472 --> 54:10.974
are you planning on
getting back into surfing?

54:12.350 --> 54:15.186
It's not, like, a life plan.

54:16.521 --> 54:19.691
More of a flash of inspiration.

54:24.655 --> 54:27.405
So I sold the condo.

54:27.407 --> 54:30.950
Mom, that is awesome. I knew you would.

54:30.952 --> 54:33.953
And I have all the faith in
the world in you too, Johnny.

54:33.955 --> 54:37.540
- Whatever path you choose.
- Thanks.

54:37.542 --> 54:39.750
I know your Dad was a bit of a live wire,

54:39.752 --> 54:43.381
but that's part of the reason
I fell in love with him.

54:45.133 --> 54:47.592
Really?

54:47.594 --> 54:49.804
I can't be mad at him anymore.

54:50.639 --> 54:52.056
He loved us.

54:53.016 --> 54:55.185
And he gave me you.

54:56.060 --> 54:58.021
We're not the same person.

54:58.855 --> 55:00.771
No, you're not.

55:00.773 --> 55:03.860
But you did get some of his magic.

55:08.823 --> 55:12.074
Sundown Records? What the hell?

55:12.076 --> 55:14.703
<i>♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪</i>

55:14.705 --> 55:16.912

55:27.133 --> 55:29.509

55:29.511 --> 55:31.636
Mom? Are you in here?

55:31.638 --> 55:32.803
Oh, hi, hon.

55:32.805 --> 55:34.430
You really should do this Pilates.

55:34.432 --> 55:36.891
- It's so amazing for the core...
- Mom.

55:36.893 --> 55:39.143
- I... I really need your help.
- For what?

55:39.145 --> 55:42.146
I posted this video of my
friend Ash playing at the pier

55:42.148 --> 55:43.898
and people loved it.

55:43.900 --> 55:45.149
But then I got this e-mail

55:45.151 --> 55:46.150
from somebody at Sundown Records

55:46.152 --> 55:48.695
saying they're gonna sue me because
I don't own the rights to the song.

55:48.697 --> 55:50.029
And neither does Ash. They do,

55:50.031 --> 55:52.532
and they're trying to turn him
into some teenybopper pop star,

55:52.534 --> 55:53.575
but that's not who he is.

55:53.577 --> 55:55.076
- I was just trying to help...
- Slow down.

55:55.078 --> 55:57.286
If you're gonna do a
monologue, you have to breathe.

56:06.423 --> 56:09.549
You know, it reminds me. A few years ago,

56:09.551 --> 56:12.594
there was a storyline where my
character became a secret rock star.

56:12.596 --> 56:15.221
And then when she wanted
to reveal her true identity,

56:15.223 --> 56:16.681
the label didn't want her to.

56:16.683 --> 56:19.434
So she made a video, which is
something that you could do!

56:19.436 --> 56:22.520
Mom, are you even listening to me?

56:22.522 --> 56:23.896
I made a video!

56:23.898 --> 56:26.232
No, I mean, you can make a real one.

56:26.234 --> 56:27.650
With a song that they don't own.

56:27.652 --> 56:29.860
I mean, you know your way
around a camera already.

56:29.862 --> 56:32.488
You're practically a director.

56:32.490 --> 56:34.198
Okay, so say I do, then what?

56:34.200 --> 56:37.993
Well, then you just let the fans decide
which version of your friend they prefer.

56:37.995 --> 56:40.039
Then the label will have to listen.

56:42.333 --> 56:45.251
Actually, not a bad idea.

56:45.253 --> 56:48.045
You see? I'm not totally
useless as a mother.

56:48.047 --> 56:49.130
Why would you say that?

56:49.132 --> 56:51.966
Well, you've never come
to me for help before.

56:51.968 --> 56:53.928
I thought you were embarrassed by me.

56:55.388 --> 56:58.640
I don't know. Sometimes
it just seems like...

56:58.642 --> 57:01.350
you wanted a daughter that's more like you.

57:01.352 --> 57:03.352
Oh, please.

57:03.354 --> 57:07.356
I always knew that you were going to grow
up to be a thousand times better than me.

57:07.358 --> 57:09.191
Now go on. You have a video to make.

57:09.193 --> 57:13.780
And if you need a totally
glamorous, gorgeous, forty...

57:13.782 --> 57:15.406
thirty-nine-year-old,

57:15.408 --> 57:16.574
you know where to find me.

57:38.139 --> 57:41.267
- Hey.
- Hey.

57:42.059 --> 57:43.476
We need to talk.

57:43.478 --> 57:45.188
Yeah. We do.

57:46.981 --> 57:50.149
So clearly, you and Ash have hit it off.

57:50.151 --> 57:51.442
I'm not blind.

57:51.444 --> 57:53.736
And clearly, I've been distant.

57:53.738 --> 57:55.905
Well, kind of.

57:55.907 --> 57:59.992
Kind of? Come on, Penn.

57:59.994 --> 58:04.121
I get it. You think I'm love with you.

58:04.123 --> 58:07.711
And I do love you. But
it's not "love" love.

58:10.505 --> 58:12.714
I'm sorry for being a douche.

58:12.716 --> 58:14.843
I love you back.

58:17.637 --> 58:19.430
I'm gonna miss you.

58:22.809 --> 58:25.685
What's going on?

58:25.687 --> 58:28.688
You're looking at Pacific
Coast High's Best Former Couple.

58:28.690 --> 58:31.108
Most Likely to Stay Friendly Exes.

58:31.902 --> 58:33.150
Really?

58:33.152 --> 58:34.736
Really.

58:34.738 --> 58:38.698
I was voted Most Likely to
Never Leave the Beach, so...

58:38.700 --> 58:41.367
I'm really glad you guys are here
because I'm gonna need your help.

58:41.369 --> 58:43.870
Well, actually, Ash is
gonna need your help.

58:57.301 --> 58:58.845
I come in peace.

58:59.512 --> 59:00.847
No camera.

59:01.639 --> 59:03.140
What are you doing here?

59:04.434 --> 59:06.392
I'm really sorry, Ash.

59:06.394 --> 59:08.436
I wanted to apologize.

59:08.438 --> 59:12.273
I was a jerk to post that
video without your permission.

59:12.275 --> 59:16.903
I realized why you were so worried, now
that your label cease-and-desisted me.

59:16.905 --> 59:19.864
You gotta get that video down right away.

59:19.866 --> 59:23.576
If it's still there in the
morning, I'm... screwed.

59:23.578 --> 59:26.871
Do you have any songs that
your label doesn't own?

59:26.873 --> 59:30.833
I started writing one the
first night I slept out here.

59:30.835 --> 59:32.334
Still have to figure
out the lyrics, though.

59:32.336 --> 59:35.548
Do you think you could
have it done by morning?

59:36.674 --> 59:38.340
Maybe.

59:38.342 --> 59:40.175
Cool.

59:40.177 --> 59:44.849
And also, I wanted to tell
you that Johnny and I broke up.

59:47.727 --> 59:49.437
Good to know.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:47.535
Do you feel good in this?

01:00:47.537 --> 01:00:49.037
I feel like myself.

01:00:49.039 --> 01:00:53.875
Steve, could you angle that reflector
a little bit to your left, please?

01:00:53.877 --> 01:00:57.005
Ash, you look like a
frickin' angel in this light.

01:00:57.839 --> 01:00:59.129
Thanks, Steve.

01:00:59.131 --> 01:01:00.673
- You ready?
- Ready.

01:01:02.635 --> 01:01:05.427
And... action!

01:01:05.429 --> 01:01:08.514
Hi, my name is Ash Baker.

01:01:08.516 --> 01:01:12.810
There's never been anything I wanted
to do more in my life than make music.

01:01:12.812 --> 01:01:16.941
So, I jumped at the chance to
record with Sundown Records.

01:01:18.275 --> 01:01:21.360
But the artist they wanted me to be...

01:01:21.362 --> 01:01:23.406
I didn't recognize that guy.

01:01:24.448 --> 01:01:26.409
So I ran away from him...

01:01:27.284 --> 01:01:29.368
all the way out to Malibu.

01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:32.496
And that's where I figured
out who I really am.

01:01:32.498 --> 01:01:35.791
So if there's anybody out there
who's trying to figure themselves out

01:01:35.793 --> 01:01:39.756
or who thinks they need to be different
than who someone wants them to be...

01:01:41.132 --> 01:01:43.925
this one's for you.

<i>E-mail them, call them.</i>

01:03:06.634 --> 01:03:08.050
People are actually calling?

01:03:08.052 --> 01:03:10.219
All morning. E-mail flooding in.

01:03:10.221 --> 01:03:11.846
We had to close down comments.

01:03:13.933 --> 01:03:16.978
Get that.

01:03:18.562 --> 01:03:20.272
Eliot Webb's office.

01:03:23.193 --> 01:03:25.067
It's Dolly Parton.

01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:26.694
She's mad about Ash Baker.

01:03:26.696 --> 01:03:30.158
Says she won't let us do that tribute
album until we make it right with the boy.

01:03:31.659 --> 01:03:33.036
Give me the phone.

01:03:36.247 --> 01:03:37.705
Dolly!

01:03:37.707 --> 01:03:38.831
How you doing, sweetheart?

01:03:38.833 --> 01:03:40.875
Not so hot, Mr. Webb.

01:03:40.877 --> 01:03:43.585
My heart is breakin' to find
out that you're trying to take

01:03:43.587 --> 01:03:45.921
this sweet and talented boy...

01:03:45.923 --> 01:03:47.548
so unique, like...

01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:50.592
<i>like an island in the stream...</i>

01:03:50.594 --> 01:03:52.763
Make this go away.

01:03:56.392 --> 01:03:58.517
- We did it.
- We did?

01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:01.436
Yeah!

01:04:03.649 --> 01:04:06.652
- Muah!
- Yeah.

01:04:16.829 --> 01:04:18.206
How does it look?

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.374
You look beautiful.

01:04:22.126 --> 01:04:25.544
I wanted to say... I'm sorry,

01:04:25.546 --> 01:04:28.964
for overstepping my bounds with Johnny.

01:04:28.966 --> 01:04:31.092
If you're worried about
my romantic feelings,

01:04:31.094 --> 01:04:32.551
don't be.

01:04:32.553 --> 01:04:34.386
This is how it's meant to be.

01:04:34.388 --> 01:04:38.432
I'm really happy you came here this
summer instead of going to Italy.

01:04:38.434 --> 01:04:40.019
Me too.

01:04:41.145 --> 01:04:42.561
I love you, baby girl.

01:04:44.732 --> 01:04:46.315
- Hey, man.
- Hey, bro.

01:04:46.317 --> 01:04:48.692
This is Carlos, one of the scouts.

01:04:48.694 --> 01:04:51.112
And this is Johnny Sanders Jr.

01:04:51.114 --> 01:04:53.822
Let me tell you, this kid is killer.

01:04:53.824 --> 01:04:56.075
I think we have to show, not tell.

01:04:56.077 --> 01:04:58.996
Nice to meet you, Johnny.
Let's see what you've got.

01:05:03.459 --> 01:05:04.961
Nice ride.

01:05:06.837 --> 01:05:10.256
I got the idea to cut down
this board in my dream.

01:05:10.258 --> 01:05:12.633
I didn't ever get to thank you.

01:05:12.635 --> 01:05:14.053
It was nothing.

01:05:16.889 --> 01:05:19.058
Meant to be.

01:05:28.442 --> 01:05:31.610
So does Johnny want to compete?

01:05:31.612 --> 01:05:33.821
'Cause we'd love to have him on the team.

01:05:33.823 --> 01:05:37.032
Last I heard, he's taken a few
classes at Art Center, but...

01:05:37.034 --> 01:05:39.287
he's not ruling surfing out.

01:05:40.913 --> 01:05:44.332
What about you? Isn't
your suspension up soon?

01:05:44.334 --> 01:05:47.918
Me? Nah, not the kind of attention I want.

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.255
Thanks for asking, but I'm
pretty content with where I'm at.

01:05:51.257 --> 01:05:54.844
I get to help people. I'm
like a therapist or something.

01:06:03.978 --> 01:06:05.853
What about that wet suit he's wearing?

01:06:05.855 --> 01:06:07.896
You wanna meet the artist?

01:06:07.898 --> 01:06:09.064
Camilla?

01:06:09.066 --> 01:06:10.440
Yeah?

01:06:10.442 --> 01:06:13.152
Would you be down to make a bunch
of your wet suits for the team?

01:06:13.154 --> 01:06:15.154
We could commission a whole line.

01:06:15.156 --> 01:06:19.035
Um... Yeah, I think we
could work something out.

So... I'm hoping that
you can take me seriously.

We'll see.

So, I haven't seen you in a while.

01:11:14.413 --> 01:11:17.708
- What's been going on?
- I came back to do a little art film with a friend.

01:11:18.417 --> 01:11:20.294
Cheers to that.
