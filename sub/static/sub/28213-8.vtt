WEBVTT

00:05.584 --> 00:07.193
And I will not allow this crime...

00:07.293 --> 00:09.620
...to be used by my
opponents to silence me.

00:09.644 --> 00:11.028
He lost a child.

00:11.052 --> 00:14.052
I lost my country.

00:14.316 --> 00:16.148
I promised to mourn for 40 days.

00:16.172 --> 00:18.452
If I cut it short,
would you forgive me?

00:18.476 --> 00:20.116
My country needs me.

00:20.140 --> 00:21.908
Do you understand how
provocative this is?

00:21.932 --> 00:24.148
To imply that a woman was
stoned as she drove home.

00:24.172 --> 00:25.620
Run the story...

00:25.644 --> 00:27.092
I offer you a deal...

00:27.116 --> 00:30.100
...if you agree not to interfere
in our son's future.No.

00:30.124 --> 00:33.048
Then I'll have this
child without you.

00:33.072 --> 00:36.072
I learned to talk again,
so that I could talk to you.

00:36.844 --> 00:39.844
I learned how to move my fingers,
so that I could hold your hand.

00:41.132 --> 00:42.772
We had a deal.

00:42.796 --> 00:44.244
Caden was going to confess.

00:44.268 --> 00:46.740
It's Caden's decision.
What is his decision?

00:46.764 --> 00:49.556
I'm not doing this
to get back at him.

00:49.580 --> 00:52.580
I'm doing it for me.

00:53.232 --> 00:56.212
The country is tearing
itself apart...

00:56.236 --> 00:59.236
And that woman, who you
endorsed, might just win.

01:01.356 --> 01:04.355
I am going to watch you burn.
You will watch us all burn...

01:05.004 --> 01:08.004
Take the job!

01:09.100 --> 01:12.100
This programme contains
some strong language.

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:02.540 --> 02:04.820
They let me out.

02:04.844 --> 02:07.844
I told them it was a mistake.

02:15.404 --> 02:18.196
So... when do you leave?

02:18.220 --> 02:21.220
Tomorrow.

02:24.428 --> 02:27.428
OK...

02:33.836 --> 02:36.564
I'm going to miss you.

02:36.588 --> 02:39.588
So stay here with me.

02:44.588 --> 02:47.588
What would we do? If I stayed?

02:50.476 --> 02:52.820
I'll grow things in the garden.

02:52.844 --> 02:55.060
I'll feed the hens.

02:55.084 --> 02:57.172
We'll learn new skills.

02:57.196 --> 02:59.928
Like what? Sewing, cross stitching?

03:02.636 --> 03:05.236
How to dance.

03:05.260 --> 03:08.260
I can already dance.

03:13.836 --> 03:16.836
See.

03:37.772 --> 03:40.772
And your dad...?

03:49.164 --> 03:52.164
The Prime Minister has asked that we
enter through the main doors.

04:21.868 --> 04:24.868
Prime Minister.
Ayesha.

04:25.068 --> 04:28.068
Do you know why
I have invited you here?

04:28.396 --> 04:31.396
I admit, I am surprised.

04:32.044 --> 04:34.644
I wanted the country to see that
I could stand

04:34.668 --> 04:36.756
in the same room as you.

04:36.780 --> 04:38.932
Like this and talk.

04:38.956 --> 04:41.940
Because if I can stand
here with you,

04:41.964 --> 04:44.568
surely I've earned the right to
ask my countrymen

04:44.592 --> 04:47.124
and women to overcome
their differences.

04:47.148 --> 04:49.492
And talk.

04:49.516 --> 04:52.516
With respect, Prime Minister, that's
not the reason you invited me here.

04:53.740 --> 04:55.572
No? No.

04:55.596 --> 04:58.596
You wanted me to see... your grief.

05:00.268 --> 05:01.908
You wanted me to feel your pain.

05:01.932 --> 05:04.932
You couldn't possibly feel my pain.

05:09.804 --> 05:12.596
This meeting is personal.

05:12.620 --> 05:15.028
Emotional.

05:15.052 --> 05:17.844
And pointless.

05:17.868 --> 05:20.660
You're an extraordinary man, Max.

05:20.684 --> 05:23.684
Built like no other.

05:24.268 --> 05:27.268
You know, your problem was you never
really understood our relationship.

05:29.068 --> 05:31.092
Enlighten me.

05:31.116 --> 05:34.116
My job... is to take
as much as I can.

05:35.596 --> 05:37.368
For as long as I can.

05:37.392 --> 05:39.028
Your job was to stop me.

05:39.052 --> 05:42.052
You're not my job, Max.

05:42.124 --> 05:45.124
My job...

05:46.988 --> 05:49.780
My job is to walk the line.

05:49.804 --> 05:50.932
What line is that?

05:50.956 --> 05:53.812
Between those who voted for me
and those who didn't.

05:53.836 --> 05:55.476
You can call that weak.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.528
You can call that compromise.

05:57.552 --> 06:00.552
But for ten years, I've walked that
line and I'll still walk it...

06:03.436 --> 06:06.436
...even after the murder of my son.

06:22.124 --> 06:25.124
You are playing with forces
you do not understand.

06:27.756 --> 06:30.756
This kind of hatred
is not yours to control.

06:31.852 --> 06:34.852
You can't win an election
and then pack it away.

06:35.692 --> 06:37.652
It will burn

06:37.676 --> 06:40.676
long after you've jetted
out of the country.

06:45.676 --> 06:48.676
Here is what I know -

06:48.940 --> 06:51.940
if you win, Prime Minister...

06:52.396 --> 06:55.396
...I'll be right back here.

06:55.468 --> 06:58.468
Like I always am.

06:59.052 --> 07:02.052
Not this time, Max.

07:02.508 --> 07:05.508
This time, it changes.

07:32.972 --> 07:35.972
Do you know, after Maggie's wedding,
Max offered me a job?

07:38.796 --> 07:41.796
Caden's job.
My son's job for my son's silence.

07:45.644 --> 07:48.644
Such a Max thing to do.

07:49.676 --> 07:51.508
Why didn't you tell me?

07:51.532 --> 07:52.788
Because I said no.

07:52.812 --> 07:55.812
In the room, of course.

07:56.844 --> 07:59.844
Is that the end of it?

08:01.004 --> 08:04.004
My son leaves hospital tomorrow.

08:04.908 --> 08:07.908
Kathryn... do you want the job?

08:12.524 --> 08:15.444
Look, I just hate what this
paper's done to my son.

08:15.468 --> 08:17.428
I hate what this paper's become.

08:17.452 --> 08:20.452
Which is why you're
going to change it.

08:23.404 --> 08:26.404
You're excited by the idea.

08:27.628 --> 08:30.628
Yeah.

08:32.107 --> 08:35.107
Take it.

08:36.076 --> 08:38.611
Thank you so much. Thank you, guys.

09:18.636 --> 09:21.636
Mum! Oh, my God!
I'm OK.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.716
Who did it?
Hooligans.

09:25.740 --> 09:27.956
Or so the police say.

09:27.980 --> 09:30.196
But they weren't hooligans.
I saw them.

09:30.220 --> 09:31.732
They were men.

09:31.756 --> 09:33.652
Organised. Political.

09:33.676 --> 09:35.700
Where are you going?
Back out there.

09:35.724 --> 09:37.172
Mum...

09:37.196 --> 09:39.476
I won't be sensible,
Lauren, not today.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.500
This is the fight of our lives.

09:42.828 --> 09:45.828
When your country's at stake,
there are no sidelines to stand on.

10:02.924 --> 10:05.588
I like seeing what
people are reading,

10:05.612 --> 10:08.612
you know, when they've only
got a few days left to live.

10:09.196 --> 10:12.196
There's a guy along the
corridor, skinny as a rake,

10:14.316 --> 10:17.316
death knocking at his door and
he's reading The Wizard Of Oz.

10:23.404 --> 10:26.404
I love him for that.

10:29.932 --> 10:32.932
Caden's returning
to London tomorrow.

10:35.628 --> 10:37.332
No more delays.

10:37.356 --> 10:40.356
You bring him straight here.

10:40.492 --> 10:43.492
We do the interview here,
post his answers.

10:45.164 --> 10:46.932
It all goes up online.

10:46.956 --> 10:49.684
Right before this fucking election.

10:49.708 --> 10:52.708
Uh-hmm...?

11:09.036 --> 11:12.036
Tell me, can you two make it work?

11:21.388 --> 11:24.388
If I can't make it work with him,
I can't make it work with anyone.

11:40.204 --> 11:43.204
You think Caden chose you
because you're broken.

11:45.324 --> 11:48.324
But he chose you
because you're beautiful.

12:00.748 --> 12:03.748
Good luck.
Thank you.

12:26.284 --> 12:29.284
Would you like some tea?

12:29.804 --> 12:31.572
Why are you doing this?

12:31.596 --> 12:34.196
Because I wanted to spend
some time with you.

12:34.220 --> 12:37.220
And I probably won't see you very
much for the next couple of days.

12:37.612 --> 12:40.612
"Neck and neck in the polls,
Angela takes time out of her busy"

12:41.132 --> 12:44.132
"campaign to cook for her family."

12:44.204 --> 12:47.204
There you go.

12:47.340 --> 12:49.300
This may be a bad lunch.

12:49.324 --> 12:50.900
But it's not a cynical one.

12:50.924 --> 12:53.924
Pass your plate...

12:54.764 --> 12:57.172
What's happening at school?

12:57.196 --> 12:59.732
Nothing.

12:59.756 --> 13:02.756
Well, at least I know you won't
grow up to be a politician.

13:03.148 --> 13:04.660
It's nothing, Mum.

13:04.684 --> 13:07.684
What are they saying about you?

13:08.780 --> 13:10.612
Not about me.

13:10.636 --> 13:12.148
About you.

13:12.172 --> 13:15.172
Ah. Well, I insist you tell me.

13:18.444 --> 13:21.444
They call you a fascist.

13:33.356 --> 13:36.356
Have you ever heard me
say anything cruel about anyone?

13:37.196 --> 13:39.604
About their race?
Or their religion?

13:39.628 --> 13:41.716
Or who they love?

13:41.740 --> 13:44.740
No.
Have I ever hurt another person?

13:45.708 --> 13:47.732
No.

13:47.756 --> 13:50.756
But I am someone who gets
stuff done.

13:51.596 --> 13:53.620
There's so much talking in politics.

13:53.644 --> 13:56.644
You want to build a runway, it
takes 20 years.

13:56.908 --> 13:59.908
Every difficult decision
takes ten consultations.

14:00.492 --> 14:02.644
All these clever people
afraid of making choices,

14:02.668 --> 14:03.988
is that me?

14:04.012 --> 14:07.012
No, cos I get stuff done
and I won't accept second-rate.

14:09.196 --> 14:12.196
Not for my business, not for my
family, and not for the country.

14:16.556 --> 14:19.556
Now, here's my question for you...

14:21.676 --> 14:24.676
...either I can let you handle
these bullies on your own.

14:25.644 --> 14:28.644
Or I can come into school and have a
very stern word with your teachers.

14:30.828 --> 14:33.828
And I promise you, no-one will
ever talk to you like that again.

14:38.252 --> 14:41.252
I want you to go in.

14:41.324 --> 14:44.324
Cos you want someone who gets
stuff done? Everyone does.

15:00.396 --> 15:02.804
Something's been bothering me.

15:02.828 --> 15:04.724
Maybe you can help me with it?

15:04.748 --> 15:07.540
I'll try.

15:07.564 --> 15:10.564
Why would anti-racist
demonstrators stone your car?

15:13.004 --> 15:15.604
I'm not saying
they couldn't be violent.

15:15.628 --> 15:17.140
Of course they could.

15:17.164 --> 15:19.700
Slash your tyres and throw eggs.

15:19.724 --> 15:21.048
Burn effigies.

15:21.072 --> 15:24.072
But why would they appropriate
a punishment associated with

15:24.716 --> 15:26.612
the Middle East...

15:26.636 --> 15:29.492
...to make their point...?

15:29.516 --> 15:32.180
When it doesn't...
Doesn't what?

15:32.204 --> 15:34.164
...make their point.

15:34.188 --> 15:37.188
Makes your point.

15:37.452 --> 15:40.452
That this country's culture
and laws are being invaded.

15:45.004 --> 15:48.004
You'd have to ask them.

15:48.268 --> 15:51.268
I'm asking you.

15:54.092 --> 15:57.092
Maybe it was their only option.

16:06.508 --> 16:09.508
If you win, you will have a choice -

16:09.708 --> 16:12.708
you can do everything
that you promised.

16:13.868 --> 16:16.020
And upset a whole bunch of people.

16:16.044 --> 16:18.648
Or you can compromise.

16:18.672 --> 16:21.672
Try to bring in everyone.

16:24.428 --> 16:27.428
You're wrong.
There is no choice.

16:28.140 --> 16:31.140
If I win, I'll do
everything I promised them.

16:33.516 --> 16:36.516
Every single thing.

16:58.924 --> 17:01.924
So, you spoke to him, then?

17:02.956 --> 17:05.619
Yeah.

17:05.644 --> 17:08.644
And what did he say?

17:09.036 --> 17:12.036
Mum, what did he say?!

17:13.964 --> 17:16.964
He offered me a job.

17:19.276 --> 17:22.276
What job?

17:23.243 --> 17:26.243
My job?

17:26.316 --> 17:29.316
Dad offered you my job?

17:29.452 --> 17:32.452
In return for our silence?

17:33.868 --> 17:35.828
I said no.

17:35.852 --> 17:36.980
You said no?

17:37.004 --> 17:38.516
Three times.

17:38.540 --> 17:41.540
And on the fourth time?

17:41.612 --> 17:44.612
Caden, I'll say no, five,
six, seven, 100 times...

17:45.708 --> 17:46.836
...if you want me to.

17:46.860 --> 17:48.244
It's not difficult.

17:48.268 --> 17:51.268
Except it is! Difficult...

17:51.596 --> 17:54.324
When you want to say yes.

17:54.348 --> 17:57.348
Why do you want it?

17:58.188 --> 18:01.188
That's what I don't get.

18:01.772 --> 18:04.772
Mum, why do YOU want it?

18:05.548 --> 18:08.548
My whole life, I did nothing -
when I should've done something.

18:10.156 --> 18:13.156
You brought me up, twice.

18:14.124 --> 18:17.124
You've been a mother twice.

18:17.644 --> 18:20.644
Finally, I can give you something.

18:24.236 --> 18:27.236
You can take the job. Take it.

18:28.780 --> 18:31.780
But you can't change it.
It changes you.

18:38.124 --> 18:41.124
Nick's here.

19:04.236 --> 19:06.452
Where's Caden?

19:06.476 --> 19:09.204
It's just me.

19:09.228 --> 19:11.636
I don't understand.

19:11.660 --> 19:14.660
Kathryn? We need Caden.

19:15.820 --> 19:18.420
It's not happening.

19:18.444 --> 19:21.444
What is this...?

19:31.436 --> 19:34.292
Hey.Hey.

19:34.316 --> 19:35.700
Mum's OK?

19:35.724 --> 19:38.580
She's already back out there.
Campaigning again.Mm.

19:38.604 --> 19:41.524
Do you need some time?

19:41.548 --> 19:44.404
From your first ever newsroom -
at the Pennsylvania Local.

19:44.428 --> 19:45.812
That's right.

19:45.836 --> 19:48.500
On the eve of every election,
you design the front page

19:48.524 --> 19:49.908
the old-fashioned way.

19:49.932 --> 19:52.532
Yeah, well, five years ago,
Caden did this with me.

19:52.556 --> 19:55.556
This year... I'm asking you.

19:59.472 --> 20:02.472
I dreamed one day
that you would ask me.

20:05.100 --> 20:08.100
That I would stand there.

20:10.348 --> 20:13.348
I'm sorry, Max, I can't do it.

20:15.724 --> 20:18.724
I think maybe you do need
to take some time off.

20:18.796 --> 20:21.460
I thought I was working
for you. But I wasn't.

20:21.484 --> 20:24.484
Who were you working for?

20:25.004 --> 20:28.004
An idea.

20:28.204 --> 20:31.204
That tomorrow should
be better than today.

20:31.596 --> 20:34.004
That the world my daughter
grows up in, should be

20:34.028 --> 20:37.028
better than the world I grew up in.
You were working for that idea, too.

20:38.316 --> 20:41.316
Whilst it was a winning idea.

20:41.964 --> 20:44.964
But it's not winning any more.

20:57.644 --> 21:00.644
I tracked down your ex-husband.
Why?

21:02.252 --> 21:05.252
I always check up on my employees.

21:05.836 --> 21:08.116
He's married to someone else now.
Yes, I know.

21:08.140 --> 21:10.356
Yeah. He's got two kids. A home.

21:10.380 --> 21:12.020
He's got a steady job.

21:12.044 --> 21:15.044
He didn't hate
the idea of being a father.

21:15.372 --> 21:18.372
He hated the idea of being
a father to my little girl.

21:21.072 --> 21:24.072
Am I the only man in your life
who hasn't let you down?

21:26.444 --> 21:29.444
Yes, you are.

21:30.156 --> 21:33.156
What did I teach you?
Be loyal to people.

21:34.316 --> 21:36.340
Not ideas.

21:36.364 --> 21:38.328
The right people never let you down.

21:38.352 --> 21:41.208
Ideas always do.

21:41.232 --> 21:44.232
I'm very sorry to have
disappointed you.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.908
Out of curiosity, why don't you
wait until after the election?

21:52.300 --> 21:55.300
She might lose.
I've always been honest with you.

21:58.188 --> 22:01.188
Yes, you have.

22:03.628 --> 22:06.628
Yes, you have.

22:25.900 --> 22:28.900
You can go now.

23:22.992 --> 23:25.992
You're...
Where's Caden?

23:29.132 --> 23:30.516
I need to explain.

23:30.540 --> 23:33.540
No, don't explain,
just tell me, where's your son?

23:38.092 --> 23:41.092
He's not coming.

23:42.700 --> 23:44.532
Why not?

23:44.556 --> 23:47.412
Hmm?

23:47.436 --> 23:50.436
Max offered me a job running the
newspapers for him in this country.

23:52.492 --> 23:55.492
He's offered you a job?

23:57.804 --> 24:00.804
If you keep Caden quiet?

24:01.516 --> 24:04.516
My God.

24:04.844 --> 24:07.252
Max is good.

24:07.276 --> 24:10.276
Who better, to silence a
mummy's boy, than his mummy?

24:13.036 --> 24:14.164
Maggie, listen to me...

24:14.188 --> 24:16.020
No, I don't want to listen to you.

24:16.044 --> 24:19.044
I want to talk to your son.

24:19.116 --> 24:22.116
That's why you're going to take
the job, isn't it?

24:22.316 --> 24:24.340
Because you want people to
talk to you.

24:24.364 --> 24:25.556
For a change.

24:25.580 --> 24:27.092
Maggie, you listen to me!

24:27.116 --> 24:29.908
What are we going to achieve
if we attack Max?

24:29.932 --> 24:32.932
What, a new code of ethics?
A public inquiry?

24:33.708 --> 24:36.564
Max will just roll
with those changes

24:36.588 --> 24:39.588
and then he will roll those
changes back again.

24:40.300 --> 24:43.300
The only way to make a
difference is from the inside.

24:43.884 --> 24:46.884
Now, what, what
if I was to say to Nick, you can

24:47.532 --> 24:49.940
have your old job back.

24:49.964 --> 24:52.964
You can write the stories you
have always wanted to write.

24:54.316 --> 24:57.316
I'd say for my first story,
under your new regime

24:57.516 --> 25:00.516
I want to write about everything
we've uncovered.

25:01.164 --> 25:04.164
The blackmail, the theft,
the corruption of the police,

25:04.684 --> 25:07.220
our politicians, the intimidation -

25:07.244 --> 25:10.244
I-I want to write about the
illegal practices. The phone hacking

25:10.700 --> 25:12.084
and surveillance

25:12.108 --> 25:15.108
that took place under Caden -
under your son.

25:15.564 --> 25:18.564
For my first story.

25:19.404 --> 25:22.404
So what do you say, Kathryn? Editor?

25:25.356 --> 25:27.124
What's your decision?

25:27.148 --> 25:30.148
You've got all the evidence.
You know it's true.

25:30.604 --> 25:32.180
What's your answer?!

25:32.204 --> 25:35.060
Come on, Maggie, you
know what my answer is.

25:35.084 --> 25:38.084
You know my hands are tied.

25:38.924 --> 25:41.924
You know... it might look like I'm...

25:44.428 --> 25:47.428
...the one dying in this room...

25:49.996 --> 25:52.996
...you are,
right now as you sit there...

25:54.924 --> 25:57.844
You want to destroy
something my son fucked up.

25:57.868 --> 26:00.868
Yeah. And I understand that.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.412
But it can be fixed.

26:03.436 --> 26:06.436
And I want to fix it.

26:06.508 --> 26:09.508
Because this country
needs that newspaper.

26:10.604 --> 26:12.564
Do you know how much we need?

26:12.588 --> 26:14.420
Don't you dare lecture me
about the news.

26:14.444 --> 26:15.892
This is my life...

26:15.916 --> 26:18.900
This is everything that I've
worked to protect

26:18.924 --> 26:21.924
and I have a chance with this -
to make a difference.

26:22.764 --> 26:25.620
I have a chance to make
a change for the better.

26:25.644 --> 26:28.500
This is it. This is the prize.

26:28.524 --> 26:31.524
Max would never have given this
to me if he wasn't in a corner.

26:32.112 --> 26:34.644
This is our best chance of change.

26:34.668 --> 26:37.668
If it had been given to me!
Or him!

26:41.068 --> 26:44.068
But you? Ha!

26:45.484 --> 26:48.484
You'd be just like your
son.

26:51.948 --> 26:54.868
I love my son very much.

26:54.892 --> 26:56.724
He is kind.

26:56.748 --> 26:59.540
And he is gentle.

26:59.564 --> 27:02.564
And I am nothing like him.

28:07.212 --> 28:09.940
The front door's locked.

28:09.964 --> 28:12.964
Yeah.
Why is it locked?

28:13.484 --> 28:15.892
I locked it.
You locked it?

28:15.916 --> 28:18.916
So you'd talk to me first.
Give me the keys.

28:23.020 --> 28:25.684
Can I ask...
No, you can't ask...

28:25.708 --> 28:26.900
...where you're going?

28:26.924 --> 28:29.924
I'm not your prisoner.
Give me the keys.

28:33.516 --> 28:35.220
You're about to make a mistake.

28:35.244 --> 28:37.524
Who are you? Huh? Who are you?

28:37.548 --> 28:39.380
Stranger! Locking me in,

28:39.404 --> 28:42.404
in my own house. Give me the keys!

28:56.684 --> 28:59.684
I'm the person who understands
they didn't treat your addiction.

29:01.676 --> 29:04.212
You've been sober for months.

29:04.236 --> 29:07.236
But only because you've been
trapped in that body.

29:08.460 --> 29:11.460
And now you're free... in the city.

29:13.836 --> 29:16.836
I know how you feel...

29:17.420 --> 29:20.420
You want to say,
that no-one understands. But I do.

29:22.604 --> 29:25.604
I know exactly how you'll feel
when you walk out that door.

29:28.236 --> 29:30.648
It won't feel good.

29:30.672 --> 29:33.672
Like it used to,
when you first got high.

29:36.556 --> 29:39.156
You'll know,
from the moment you start,

29:39.180 --> 29:42.180
that you're making a mistake...

29:47.948 --> 29:50.948
...but it'll be too late.

29:51.660 --> 29:54.660
So you keep going.

29:55.436 --> 29:58.436
Except, your body hasn't
got any second chances left.

30:14.572 --> 30:17.572
I don't know,
I don't know what to do.

30:21.036 --> 30:24.036
What makes you happy?

30:25.708 --> 30:28.708
Who makes you happy?

30:35.820 --> 30:38.820
Does Mum make you happy?

30:42.284 --> 30:45.284
She does.

30:45.804 --> 30:48.804
She's volatile.

30:50.668 --> 30:52.180
Passionate.

30:52.204 --> 30:55.204
Unpredictable. She's never boring.

31:02.188 --> 31:05.188
Alcohol is boring.

31:07.436 --> 31:10.436
Addiction is boring.

31:12.044 --> 31:15.044
Your mum never is.

31:32.012 --> 31:35.012
All I need to hear is yes or no.

31:35.980 --> 31:38.980
Let's not pretend for a second this
is about admiration for me.

31:41.228 --> 31:43.508
I never would have considered
you for the job

31:43.532 --> 31:45.556
if I didn't think you were up to it.

31:45.580 --> 31:48.580
And if I didn't think it
advantageous to me.

31:50.060 --> 31:53.060
How can I accuse you of corruption
after I've agreed to work for you?

31:54.732 --> 31:57.732
It would be difficult, yeah.

32:04.460 --> 32:07.460
What did Angela Howard offer you?

32:07.596 --> 32:10.596
Do you want to work with me or not?

32:14.060 --> 32:16.468
Television news.

32:16.492 --> 32:18.708
Deregulated?
Yeah.

32:18.732 --> 32:21.332
Good for her. Good for me.
Good for the viewers.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.572
You're going to give her
televised propaganda?

32:23.596 --> 32:26.324
You wouldn't be working on it,
don't worry about it.

32:26.348 --> 32:29.012
You're not wrong about many things,
Max.

32:29.036 --> 32:32.036
But you are wrong
about Angela Howard.

32:32.108 --> 32:35.108
Once she's consolidated power,
she'll discard you.

32:38.572 --> 32:41.572
But you've never been thrown away.

32:41.772 --> 32:43.668
So you can't imagine that.

32:43.692 --> 32:46.292
I'm sorry, you don't
get tomorrow's cover. No.

32:46.316 --> 32:49.316
No. No. No.

32:54.828 --> 32:57.236
I want five years.

32:57.260 --> 33:00.260
No budget cuts.

33:00.332 --> 33:02.100
Editorial independence.

33:02.124 --> 33:05.124
And none of your "assurances",
"promises", or "solemn vows".

33:07.692 --> 33:10.612
This time,
MY lawyers will draw up the papers.

33:10.636 --> 33:12.212
I'll guarantee you five years...

33:12.236 --> 33:13.620
...pay.Uh-hm.

33:13.644 --> 33:15.860
I don't care about the money.

33:15.884 --> 33:17.524
I want to see in the election.

33:17.548 --> 33:19.124
What if you're incompetent?

33:19.148 --> 33:22.148
Disobedient, you mean.

33:22.476 --> 33:25.460
Whatever contracts you
put in place, I'll unravel them.

33:25.484 --> 33:27.316
Yeah, I'm sure you'll try.

33:27.340 --> 33:30.340
Yeah, and any decision you make
I disagree with, I will unpick.

33:30.412 --> 33:32.180
I'm ready for it.

33:32.204 --> 33:34.868
All of it.

33:34.892 --> 33:37.892
I was married to you.

33:40.588 --> 33:43.588
I have missed you.

33:44.428 --> 33:47.428
You think you've won, don't you?

33:47.564 --> 33:50.564
And you think you've won.

33:51.916 --> 33:54.916
That's why we have a deal.

34:06.508 --> 34:09.507
Hi.

34:34.284 --> 34:37.284
Hey.Hi.

34:46.123 --> 34:49.123
Did you ask them all to stand up?

34:49.835 --> 34:52.835
No. No, I didn't.

35:02.508 --> 35:05.508
God, I always hated this office.

35:08.268 --> 35:11.268
Do you think, erm,
Mum will like it any better?

35:15.436 --> 35:18.436
I'm not entirely sure I'm ever
going to be able to get her out.

35:25.996 --> 35:28.996
You always leave
before the votes are counted.

35:29.836 --> 35:31.540
I do.

35:31.564 --> 35:34.564
I do, yeah, I leave when there's
nothing, really, left for me to do.

35:39.756 --> 35:41.268
Won't you visit me?

35:41.292 --> 35:44.292
Come visit me in Mexico, all right?

35:44.812 --> 35:47.092
And you can bring...

35:47.116 --> 35:50.116
Bring Orla, I'd like to
meet her, if you want.

35:52.172 --> 35:54.772
See the baby.

35:54.796 --> 35:57.796
It'd make us happy.

36:03.116 --> 36:06.116
Yeah, I'd like that.

36:11.244 --> 36:14.244
Let yourself be happy.

36:15.724 --> 36:18.724
I'm going to try.

36:34.604 --> 36:36.500
You know...

36:36.524 --> 36:39.524
It's OK.

36:40.364 --> 36:43.364
I know.

37:02.060 --> 37:04.728
Shalom aleichem.
We are here.

37:04.752 --> 37:06.452
Together.

37:06.476 --> 37:09.476
Not like a family huddling
around the last embers of a fire.

37:10.892 --> 37:13.892
But to hope, to pray, for the ballot
box to banish this kind of hate.

38:11.948 --> 38:13.140
Thank you.

38:13.164 --> 38:15.572
Prime Minister Jahan Zakari
and his wife Ayesha

38:15.596 --> 38:16.980
arrive to cast their votes.

38:17.004 --> 38:19.668
That's after police stand guard
with heightened security after

38:19.692 --> 38:22.692
the tragic murder
of their son, Saif.

38:32.112 --> 38:34.644
...To the nation after a polarising
election campaign

38:34.668 --> 38:36.692
that has split the
country down the middle.

38:36.716 --> 38:39.572
If Mr Zakari holds on to his
majority for a third term,

38:39.596 --> 38:42.596
he will become one of the longest...

38:54.188 --> 38:57.188
Did I give you enough?
You gave me everything.

40:09.964 --> 40:12.964
Hello.
Thank you.

40:32.044 --> 40:35.044
...Political Landscape
for the next five years...

40:36.140 --> 40:39.140
We've spoken to 15,000 voters
in 220 constituencies...

40:41.260 --> 40:44.260
And now we can hear Big
Ben chiming ten o'clock.

40:44.460 --> 40:47.380
With polling closed we're about to
release the results of the exit

40:47.404 --> 40:50.404
polls, which have correctly
predicted the outcome

40:50.796 --> 40:52.564
for the past four elections.

40:52.588 --> 40:54.168
And here it is...

40:54.192 --> 40:57.192
...Angela Howard is set to be
the new Prime Minister...

41:45.452 --> 41:48.452
This is the gents'.I don't care.

41:53.260 --> 41:56.260
No. I don't suppose you do.

42:06.316 --> 42:09.316
Excuse me, sir. Thank you.

42:17.196 --> 42:20.196
Ten minutes
to landing, Mr Finch.

42:34.092 --> 42:37.092
You're my first visitor.

42:53.484 --> 42:56.484
I learnt how to talk...

42:56.684 --> 42:59.684
...so I could talk to you.

43:02.764 --> 43:05.620
I learnt how to walk...

43:05.644 --> 43:08.644
...so I could walk to you.

43:11.724 --> 43:14.724
I learnt how to move my hand...

43:16.396 --> 43:19.396
...so I could hold yours.

43:56.652 --> 43:59.652
You can love.

43:59.724 --> 44:02.724
But can you love unconditionally?

44:04.652 --> 44:07.188
I love you unconditionally.

44:07.212 --> 44:09.684
But you choose me.

44:09.708 --> 44:12.244
And I choose you.

44:12.268 --> 44:15.268
You know me - you know
everything about me.

44:15.660 --> 44:18.660
Can you love our son
knowing nothing of him?

44:20.204 --> 44:23.204
Can you love unseen?

44:25.708 --> 44:28.708
Can you love him unknown?

44:31.148 --> 44:34.148
I will love our son more
than I love my own life.

44:34.476 --> 44:37.476
Whether he's gentle or bold?
Brilliant or modest?

44:40.556 --> 44:42.452
Whoever he might be, yes.

44:42.476 --> 44:45.476
Whatever he is?
Whatever he might be?

44:46.188 --> 44:49.188
Whoever he becomes...

44:49.644 --> 44:52.052
...will you love him?

44:52.076 --> 44:55.076
I will.

44:59.436 --> 45:02.436
You are a man who has given so many
reassurances in your life, no?

45:06.924 --> 45:09.924
Sofia...

45:14.028 --> 45:17.028
...I was alone for many,
many years.

45:18.508 --> 45:21.508
And I accepted my loneliness...

45:22.284 --> 45:25.284
...as the price I'd have to
pay for this kind of a life.

45:27.916 --> 45:30.916
And then I met you.

45:37.964 --> 45:40.964
None of this makes any
sense... without you.

45:44.108 --> 45:47.108
If you don't take me
back, I have no place to go.

45:48.972 --> 45:51.972
You're my home.

46:38.764 --> 46:41.764
Thank you.

46:52.844 --> 46:55.844
And we will talk about number two...

46:56.620 --> 46:59.620
Ah. We should call it,
thank you, both...

47:03.276 --> 47:05.688
Kathryn.
Prime Minister.

47:05.712 --> 47:07.988
I'm sorry it's taken so long
to call you in for a meeting.

47:08.012 --> 47:11.012
Oh, understandably.

47:11.596 --> 47:14.004
You've a great many election
pledges to fulfil.

47:14.028 --> 47:17.028
One of the wisdoms all leaders
are given upon taking office is

47:17.484 --> 47:19.828
that we get one big reform.

47:19.852 --> 47:21.940
For each election victory.

47:21.964 --> 47:24.628
One change. One idea.
That's it.

47:24.652 --> 47:27.652
That's all, before this
place grinds you to a halt.

47:28.876 --> 47:30.900
I've heard it said.

47:30.924 --> 47:32.500
It's not enough.

47:32.524 --> 47:35.524
Well, you'll have to
win the next election.

47:38.604 --> 47:40.500
Have you ever been to Vegas?

47:40.524 --> 47:42.356
No, not a gambler.

47:42.380 --> 47:45.380
My husband's fond of cards.
We went a few years ago.

47:45.452 --> 47:47.732
Stayed in a big hotel.

47:47.756 --> 47:50.756
Walked through big rooms filled
with slot machines.

47:51.468 --> 47:54.468
Men and women sit there for hours,
on bar stools, just spinning

47:54.672 --> 47:57.672
the wheel, desperately
hoping for some life-changing win.

47:59.532 --> 48:02.532
And as I walked through,
I realised who they remind me of.

48:03.884 --> 48:06.884
And who's that?
Voters.

48:07.788 --> 48:09.684
Once every four or five years,

48:09.708 --> 48:12.372
they're allowed to pull the
handle, spin the wheels,

48:12.396 --> 48:15.124
desperately hoping they'll win
a house or a well-paid job.

48:15.148 --> 48:18.148
And every election they lose,
but they're told not to worry,

48:18.796 --> 48:21.796
because they'll have another
spin, in another five years.

48:25.580 --> 48:28.580
What if I said to them, I'll give
you the house, the job, the sense

48:29.228 --> 48:32.228
of dignity and pride, if you give
up the chance to spin that wheel -

48:35.244 --> 48:38.244
give up that slot machine that's
disappointed you so many times.

48:39.916 --> 48:42.916
If I said that - what do
you think they'd choose?

48:45.484 --> 48:48.484
Prime Minister, I must
remind you, respectfully,

48:49.708 --> 48:51.732
you're standing in the heart of one

48:51.756 --> 48:53.972
of the oldest
democracies in the world.

48:53.996 --> 48:56.996
What, this? This place?
This is just a house.

49:00.268 --> 49:03.188
I'm not this house.

49:03.212 --> 49:04.852
This house is me.

49:04.876 --> 49:07.876
This house belongs to all of us.

49:08.592 --> 49:11.592
I won 17 million votes.

49:12.876 --> 49:15.876
You were brought in to cover
up a corruption scandal.

49:16.844 --> 49:18.996
You are here to cash Max's reward.

49:19.020 --> 49:22.020
And report my news.

49:23.436 --> 49:26.436
One of the reasons you won
the election, Prime Minister,

49:27.212 --> 49:30.212
is because you were underestimated.

49:33.420 --> 49:36.420
I'm surprised to see you make
the same mistakes so quickly.

49:37.068 --> 49:39.476
I'm not here to report your news.

49:39.500 --> 49:42.420
I'm here to report the news.

49:42.444 --> 49:45.444
For the next five years.

49:45.516 --> 49:48.516
Until they pull the handle
and spin the wheel.

49:53.068 --> 49:55.220
Don't count on it.

49:55.244 --> 49:58.244
On what?

49:59.472 --> 50:02.132
Any of it.

50:02.156 --> 50:04.692
You might think that
newspapers are old-fashioned

50:04.716 --> 50:06.484
and quaint.

50:06.508 --> 50:09.508
Now that you have your TV channel.

50:09.964 --> 50:12.964
But for the next five
years, my papers,

50:13.228 --> 50:16.228
and they are my papers -
will be by your side...

50:18.348 --> 50:21.348
...watching you, reporting on you...

50:21.804 --> 50:24.804
...every step of the way...

50:25.392 --> 50:28.392
...Prime Minister.

50:47.916 --> 50:50.916
Adelante, por favor.
Gracias.

50:51.116 --> 50:53.460
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
No, not at all.

50:53.484 --> 50:55.252
No, you're a busy man.

50:55.276 --> 50:58.276
I was happy to enjoy the
surroundings.

50:58.732 --> 51:00.180
You asked for another meeting.

51:00.204 --> 51:03.204
But after our last conversation, I'm
not sure what you wish to

51:03.792 --> 51:06.792
talk about. I was very clear, my
party's not doing any deals.

51:09.292 --> 51:12.292
Ignacio... I'm sorry, can
I use your first name?

51:12.492 --> 51:13.940
Yeah, of course.

51:13.964 --> 51:16.964
Good... Have you ever
been to Shanghai?

51:19.276 --> 51:22.068
Shanghai? No.

51:22.092 --> 51:24.244
Shanghai, it's a fascinating city.

51:24.268 --> 51:26.548
I don't doubt it.
Yeah.

51:26.572 --> 51:29.572
We're told, we're informed,
we're given the impression that the

51:31.632 --> 51:34.632
Chinese domestic market is fixated
by Western luxury brands.

51:38.540 --> 51:41.012
You've heard that, right?
Yes, that was my sense.

51:41.036 --> 51:44.020
Yeah, and it's true.
There are flagship stores.

51:44.044 --> 51:45.812
Beautifully designed.

51:45.836 --> 51:48.500
Glass and gold and onyx.

51:48.524 --> 51:50.808
I've seen photos.

51:50.832 --> 51:53.364
But I must tell you,
when I was there

51:53.388 --> 51:56.388
I didn't see this Chinese market
fawning over Western brands.

51:58.124 --> 52:01.124
I saw Western brands fawning
over the Chinese market.

52:02.732 --> 52:05.732
I saw global corporate giants
kneeling before the power

52:07.152 --> 52:09.812
of Chinese consumers.

52:09.836 --> 52:12.836
Saw these billboards
begging for their attention.

52:13.036 --> 52:16.036
Stores desperate for their
business, for their money.

52:17.772 --> 52:20.372
No.

52:20.396 --> 52:23.396
No, these brands were not there
to conquer or to colonise,

52:25.516 --> 52:28.516
they were there to serve.

52:34.412 --> 52:37.412
I'm here to serve...

52:37.868 --> 52:40.868
...if you're here to win.

55:47.756 --> 55:50.100
Good, good. Push. Push.

55:53.260 --> 55:56.260
You're doing great,
you're doing great.

55:57.932 --> 56:00.276
You're doing great.

56:00.300 --> 56:03.300
OK, all right?

56:05.484 --> 56:06.740
Yes!

56:06.764 --> 56:08.404
Yes, yes! It's all right.

56:08.428 --> 56:09.940
You got it, you got it.

56:09.964 --> 56:11.476
Push, push.

56:11.500 --> 56:13.848
Push, yes, yes!

56:13.872 --> 56:15.768
Oh, honey!

56:15.792 --> 56:17.620
You did it. Yes!

56:17.644 --> 56:20.644
You did great, you did great.

56:20.716 --> 56:22.488
You did great.

56:30.444 --> 56:32.276
So beautiful.

56:32.300 --> 56:34.008
So beautiful.

57:35.852 --> 57:38.852
Shhh, shhh...
