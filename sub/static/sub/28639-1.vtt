00:53.875 --> 00:54.667
Pornography

00:55.500 --> 00:56.667
is

00:57.459 --> 01:00.584
a genre that lays bare,
if I may say so,

01:01.084 --> 01:03.667
without the intermediary of story

01:03.834 --> 01:05.750
or screenplay,

01:07.167 --> 01:10.084
the simple crudity of our bodies,

01:10.250 --> 01:11.750
without wit either,

01:12.750 --> 01:14.750
and without talent most often.

01:15.084 --> 01:16.667
And without invention.

01:17.625 --> 01:19.875
These films are often, unfortunately,

01:20.042 --> 01:23.125
mediocre, sad, repetitive.

01:23.292 --> 01:24.792
You've seen films that...

01:24.959 --> 01:27.125
A few. One soon gets bored.

01:52.334 --> 01:54.042
Franck, can we go on?

01:57.500 --> 01:59.334
Yeah, go on, I'm listening.

02:00.167 --> 02:02.875
So it has three vibration speeds.

02:03.042 --> 02:03.959
Touch. It's salt.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.459
It's salt?

02:06.625 --> 02:07.417
Salt.

02:07.584 --> 02:09.334
Soft, you mean. Soft.

02:09.834 --> 02:11.709
It comes in three colors.

02:11.875 --> 02:13.250
Pink, the ladies like.

02:13.417 --> 02:15.917
Sorry, buddy. I apologize but...

02:17.500 --> 02:20.167
I got fucked up last night and I...

02:21.584 --> 02:22.625
I gotta sit.

02:23.917 --> 02:25.667
You are sitting, boss.

02:30.625 --> 02:33.000
In that case, I need to lay down.

02:37.584 --> 02:39.875
Egg is small, so good for walking.

02:40.042 --> 02:41.875
Thanks to remote control,

02:42.042 --> 02:44.334
the girl makes the egg work

02:44.500 --> 02:46.167
anyplace, anytime.

02:46.334 --> 02:49.167
Know what? Just order 30.

02:49.750 --> 02:50.792
Alright.

02:51.709 --> 02:55.042
Not green, just pink and blue.

02:55.334 --> 02:56.709
And 30 or so

02:58.125 --> 02:59.584
sets of wawa balls.

02:59.750 --> 03:00.667
Alright.

03:12.375 --> 03:13.625
Seen my dogs?

03:14.292 --> 03:15.000
Dogs?

03:21.250 --> 03:23.667
And ask the girls if...

03:23.834 --> 03:26.250
If they need gadgets in the cabins

03:26.417 --> 03:27.917
for their shows.

03:28.750 --> 03:29.750
Hakim.

03:29.917 --> 03:31.250
Hi, Serge.

03:32.084 --> 03:33.834
Isn't that my belt?

03:34.625 --> 03:36.000
Yeah, sure.

03:36.542 --> 03:37.625
We gotta go.

03:37.792 --> 03:38.625
Say, Serge...

03:40.459 --> 03:41.875
Do we have dogs?

03:42.459 --> 03:44.167
Dogs? Course not.

03:45.667 --> 03:47.042
Holy shit.

06:09.792 --> 06:11.459
DIRTY COPS

06:20.625 --> 06:22.167
Your entrance is shit.

06:22.459 --> 06:24.042
First rule is eye contact.

06:24.209 --> 06:26.375
Make eye contact, look at him.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.334
Like it's one-to-one.

06:28.750 --> 06:30.625
- Like that?
- Without squinting.

06:30.792 --> 06:33.459
Lock your eyes on him and don't let go.

06:33.625 --> 06:34.542
Franck?

06:35.500 --> 06:37.959
The chick outside
wants to work with us.

06:38.125 --> 06:39.084
Another time.

06:39.584 --> 06:40.334
What?

06:41.709 --> 06:43.167
She's not bad-looking.

06:43.959 --> 06:45.625
50 says you'll wanna fuck her.

06:45.792 --> 06:48.209
- Another bullshit bet?
- 100 says I won't.

06:48.375 --> 06:49.375
- 150.
- 200.

06:49.542 --> 06:50.584
You'll see.

06:50.750 --> 06:51.584
Stand up.

06:52.875 --> 06:54.209
When you undress...

06:54.875 --> 06:56.375
There you go, not like that.

06:56.542 --> 06:58.042
It's a strip, Chloé.

06:58.417 --> 06:59.792
Sway when you undress.

07:00.875 --> 07:02.625
Better. Give him the come-on.

07:02.792 --> 07:04.625
That's right, play the tease.

07:04.917 --> 07:06.792
Move, don't stay head-on.

07:06.959 --> 07:08.500
He paid to see some ass.

07:08.709 --> 07:11.584
And it's worth every cent. Perfect.

07:12.042 --> 07:14.000
Great. You got another burn there.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.667
People!

07:15.959 --> 07:17.250
Don't be shy, sweetie.

07:17.417 --> 07:18.167
Hello.

07:18.334 --> 07:19.084
Hi.

07:19.250 --> 07:20.417
Hello.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.292
What can we do for you?

07:23.709 --> 07:24.875
I want a job.

07:25.334 --> 07:27.542
- You're a stripper?
- I'm an actress.

07:27.792 --> 07:29.084
Or want to be.

07:29.250 --> 07:31.250
I'm applying to the Conservatory.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.792
I'm lost. If you want to act, why strip?

07:34.125 --> 07:36.084
My boyfriend says it's a good idea.

07:37.292 --> 07:39.000
- What?
- Nothing.

07:40.292 --> 07:42.084
Show us your boobs, will you?

07:44.917 --> 07:47.959
Babe, it's a strip joint
not the Conservatory, sorry.

07:54.959 --> 07:55.709
Pretty.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.750
Magnificent.

08:03.000 --> 08:03.792
Your name?

08:04.542 --> 08:05.542
Virginie.

08:05.959 --> 08:09.292
Find a new one.
Nobody wants to bone a Virginie.

08:09.459 --> 08:10.667
Wrong. Personally...

08:10.959 --> 08:13.667
You're wrong
but I came up with another.

08:13.917 --> 08:14.834
Which is?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.542
Caprice. It has a ring.

08:16.709 --> 08:17.917
- One word.
- Magnificent.

08:18.084 --> 08:20.167
Caprice is so ethereal.

08:20.334 --> 08:21.417
Thanks.

08:24.000 --> 08:24.917
I'm hired?

08:28.625 --> 08:30.167
Sure, let's try you out.

08:30.834 --> 08:31.834
Really?

08:33.792 --> 08:34.458
Thank you.

08:34.667 --> 08:36.333
Girls, show her the moves...

08:36.500 --> 08:38.917
Welcome, sweetpea. Welcome.

08:39.333 --> 08:40.167
So pretty.

08:40.333 --> 08:41.292
Thanks.

08:41.958 --> 08:42.917
Welcome.

08:43.083 --> 08:44.750
- Chloé.
- Hi, Chloé.

08:46.125 --> 08:48.417
Change into anything that appeals here.

08:48.625 --> 08:51.084
Sergio, if we don't get paid, we quit.

08:51.250 --> 08:52.667
You're pushing it.

08:52.834 --> 08:55.125
Baby, what's gotten into you?

08:57.459 --> 08:59.584
Did we ever let you down? I think not.

09:00.334 --> 09:02.042
You'll get paid, don't worry.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.792
Now, go flaunt that pretty ass.

09:08.292 --> 09:09.417
Go on!

09:26.250 --> 09:27.917
So you wanna make love?

09:28.209 --> 09:30.084
Enjoy the movie.

09:30.375 --> 09:31.084
Alright then.

09:31.584 --> 09:32.792
- Going where?
- Bathroom.

09:32.959 --> 09:34.625
Fast. Make it snappy.

09:34.792 --> 09:35.792
Two minutes.

10:05.209 --> 10:06.500
How's business?

10:15.417 --> 10:18.250
Move it. You can't park there, buddy.

10:18.834 --> 10:20.834
Get your ride outta here.

10:22.959 --> 10:24.125
Crazy man.

10:38.459 --> 10:41.084
Nothing happens
till this place is jumping.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.334
I love Bazin and his dumb ideas
but reality's different.

10:48.042 --> 10:50.542
If it goes on like this, we'll be broke.

10:50.709 --> 10:54.167
To buy crap and watch movies,
guys come in, no problem.

10:55.459 --> 10:58.000
The girls cost too much for them.
Too much.

10:58.167 --> 11:00.042
Come on, the girls are hardly...

11:00.209 --> 11:01.584
That's not the point.

11:01.750 --> 11:04.500
How would they know?
They don't come in for chicks.

11:05.292 --> 11:08.500
We gotta get it out there,
the girls are bombshells.

11:09.584 --> 11:11.292
No reason why it can't take off.

11:12.584 --> 11:13.667
You're hot?

11:15.042 --> 11:16.000
No.

11:16.292 --> 11:17.417
Looks that way.

11:21.917 --> 11:23.875
Hottest chicks in Paris, buddy.

11:24.042 --> 11:25.000
Cheap.

11:25.167 --> 11:26.417
Take a look.

11:26.667 --> 11:28.125
Jerk off someplace else.

11:44.125 --> 11:45.917
Henri, are you still filming?

11:46.084 --> 11:47.334
We're rolling.

11:50.084 --> 11:52.792
The kid's gonna come in 30 seconds.

11:53.584 --> 11:54.292
20 even.

11:54.459 --> 11:57.167
Go ahead, Jean-Jacques. On her, do it.

12:05.542 --> 12:07.667
Wonderful, and cut. That's a goodie.

12:07.834 --> 12:08.917
Round of applause.

12:11.084 --> 12:12.959
Bravo, magnificent.

12:15.417 --> 12:17.084
- You ok?
- Sure.

12:19.209 --> 12:22.292
I'm making a movie in two days
with a dog.

12:22.459 --> 12:23.542
Yes?

12:24.042 --> 12:27.625
It pays a real bundle,
way more than usual.

12:27.792 --> 12:31.042
- Interested?
- I'm flattered, deeply touched.

12:31.209 --> 12:32.917
But I'm scared of dogs.

12:36.334 --> 12:37.542
Sorry.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.667
I understand.

12:40.959 --> 12:42.209
We'll call that lunch.

12:42.834 --> 12:46.084
Then we set up
for the dialogue scene earlier.

12:49.625 --> 12:50.250
I mean...

12:53.084 --> 12:54.834
Your dancers ever done film work?

12:55.542 --> 12:56.917
One did stag movies.

12:57.084 --> 12:58.292
And another...

12:59.292 --> 13:01.125
Another posed for magazines.

13:02.209 --> 13:04.834
They're up for it.
They like to be watched.

13:06.459 --> 13:10.209
If you want 10-15 movies
for the booths,

13:10.709 --> 13:11.917
it's a morning's work

13:12.084 --> 13:14.417
at an unbeatable price.

13:15.834 --> 13:17.334
I guarantee you,

13:17.500 --> 13:20.417
once they see the chicks
in the movie booths,

13:20.584 --> 13:22.625
they'll dash into the strip cabins

13:22.792 --> 13:24.292
desperate to fuck them.

13:29.167 --> 13:31.125
We're in, we're interested.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.209
- Henri, we're ready.
- I'm not.

13:36.417 --> 13:37.667
Pain in the ass!

13:38.292 --> 13:39.125
So...

13:40.000 --> 13:41.834
Don't hire good-looking guys.

13:44.167 --> 13:45.917
A good-looking guy, that's erotic.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.542
An ugly guy, that's porno.

13:49.334 --> 13:51.250
Ok, I get the idea.

14:04.250 --> 14:07.500
Say to yourself,
do it with him, do it with anyone.

14:10.125 --> 14:12.917
We'll need ID
and a social security number.

14:13.084 --> 14:14.292
No problem.

14:14.459 --> 14:17.459
- I'm so happy for her.
- You been with Caprice long?

14:17.625 --> 14:18.584
Yes, six months.

14:18.750 --> 14:19.542
Girls, over here.

14:21.834 --> 14:22.750
If you want

14:22.917 --> 14:25.542
to start with each other
to warm up, go for it.

14:26.209 --> 14:28.500
No, it's fine, we're good.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.167
Alright, girls. Let's fuck him.

14:31.834 --> 14:32.875
Let's go, girls!

14:33.834 --> 14:35.250
Sheila, your helmet.

14:37.959 --> 14:39.334
Monkey Cock!

14:40.500 --> 14:42.375
Quit clowning around there!

14:42.542 --> 14:43.292
Coming!

14:43.459 --> 14:45.084
We have a film to make.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.334
Where'd you find him?

14:47.875 --> 14:49.334
Monkey Cock?

14:50.209 --> 14:51.584
At the store yesterday.

14:53.167 --> 14:54.250
Only one guy?

14:54.667 --> 14:55.834
I wanted two but...

14:56.584 --> 14:57.875
We can't afford it.

14:58.042 --> 14:59.917
You like my watch then?

15:00.209 --> 15:02.000
- You like it?
- I sure do.

15:02.167 --> 15:03.667
- Pisses you off?
- No.

15:05.542 --> 15:06.917
Take it anytime.

15:07.084 --> 15:08.250
I already do.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.667
Guys, can I ask a favor?

15:12.834 --> 15:13.709
Camera!

15:13.875 --> 15:16.000
The 300 bucks. Can I get it now?

15:17.084 --> 15:18.542
As an advance.

15:20.292 --> 15:21.584
We can do that.

15:28.584 --> 15:29.667
Here we go.

15:38.709 --> 15:40.917
You like my planet, don't you?

15:41.250 --> 15:42.917
That's great. Cut!

15:44.834 --> 15:46.042
Really good.

15:48.084 --> 15:49.417
We'll go wider now.

15:51.584 --> 15:52.750
We cut, dammit!

15:53.875 --> 15:54.792
We cut.

15:54.959 --> 15:56.917
It's not for real. Stop!

15:57.084 --> 15:59.375
We're here to make a movie, not fuck.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.000
Knock it off!

16:01.834 --> 16:02.875
Dipshits!

16:03.042 --> 16:06.542
Relax, hold onto your juice.
I have other stuff to shoot.

16:06.709 --> 16:08.250
Come on, let's get on it.

16:13.417 --> 16:14.542
Wide shot now.

16:15.250 --> 16:17.125
We'll need the 40.

16:17.375 --> 16:18.667
Who is that guy?

16:19.459 --> 16:20.584
I dunno.

16:21.542 --> 16:23.292
He said he was a PE teacher.

16:24.584 --> 16:25.875
Start nice and slow.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.667
Let's go.

16:29.459 --> 16:31.209
No. I say, let's go.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.375
Let's go now.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.041
Guys get off on this?

17:15.625 --> 17:16.791
Lots of freaks.

17:16.959 --> 17:20.084
One guy asked me
to make a movie with babes

17:20.250 --> 17:21.834
with their legs in plaster.

17:25.416 --> 17:26.291
Great, Sheila.

17:28.875 --> 17:30.417
There's not enough light.

17:31.292 --> 17:33.834
Amazing eyes
and we don't see a glimmer.

17:34.917 --> 17:37.417
A glimmer? I can't work miracles.

17:37.917 --> 17:39.584
Lighting costs money.

17:39.917 --> 17:43.250
Then I'll give you
glimmers and more, no problem.

17:50.167 --> 17:50.834
That's gross.

17:51.084 --> 17:52.334
Cut that out.

17:55.709 --> 17:57.250
Gross, really gross.

17:58.750 --> 18:01.417
How come? You ever see that before?

18:01.584 --> 18:03.209
Nowhere, that's for sure.

18:03.375 --> 18:04.834
It's not gross.

18:05.959 --> 18:06.959
It's beautiful.

18:07.125 --> 18:08.709
Beautiful and good.

18:09.292 --> 18:10.542
What's up?

18:10.875 --> 18:12.625
Watch it before you...

18:12.792 --> 18:13.834
Sit down.

18:14.292 --> 18:17.125
Sit down, we'll talk later. Watch!

18:17.792 --> 18:19.500
Seriously, girls, he's a singer.

18:20.209 --> 18:22.250
Swear to god, he's a singer.

18:22.417 --> 18:24.459
He even invited me to a show.

18:24.625 --> 18:25.625
It's called...

18:26.584 --> 18:29.167
It's called The Tales of Hoffmann.

18:29.417 --> 18:30.292
Ever go?

18:30.750 --> 18:32.125
- Where?
- The opera.

18:32.292 --> 18:34.500
- How's that, Caprice?
- Very good.

18:34.917 --> 18:36.042
Thanks to you,

18:36.209 --> 18:38.292
it's much prettier now.

18:40.792 --> 18:42.167
- Which is it?
- G-string.

18:42.334 --> 18:43.125
Not comfy?

18:43.292 --> 18:45.250
Awful. I'd rip it all off.

18:45.417 --> 18:46.125
Girls!

18:46.292 --> 18:46.917
Change.

18:47.625 --> 18:49.042
Look what I've brought.

18:49.209 --> 18:50.042
What is it?

18:50.542 --> 18:52.375
- Tell us.
- A little surprise!

18:52.542 --> 18:53.917
Your exploits!

18:56.292 --> 18:57.750
Congratulations, babies!

18:57.917 --> 18:59.042
Thank you!

18:59.250 --> 19:00.542
Night of the Boner!

19:02.584 --> 19:04.167
Blow Me I'm Dreaming!

19:04.625 --> 19:06.292
You're beautiful, Caprice.

19:06.459 --> 19:07.875
Lady and the Slut!

19:08.042 --> 19:09.084
Tongue Tales!

19:09.250 --> 19:10.875
Widow G-Spot!

19:14.000 --> 19:15.375
Calls for a celebration!

19:15.542 --> 19:16.625
It's my butt!

19:18.959 --> 19:20.709
Your butt! Your butt!

20:23.875 --> 20:26.959
Six months earlier

20:51.375 --> 20:52.167
Here, Martin.

21:01.250 --> 21:04.667
The Internal Revenue people
have found an establishment.

21:06.542 --> 21:07.750
You start tomorrow.

21:08.625 --> 21:11.625
Our resources are limited
so keep it ticking over.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.792
I've no idea how these joints work.

21:17.917 --> 21:20.709
I brought the accounts
of several peep shows.

21:21.375 --> 21:22.459
Learn on the job.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
The minister wants
the X-Rated Law applied vigorously

21:28.167 --> 21:31.875
to put an end to extortion
and money-laundering in pornos.

21:33.167 --> 21:35.417
Find a way to make contact

21:35.584 --> 21:37.334
and ensnare a whole crew.

21:37.750 --> 21:39.334
To set an example.

21:41.042 --> 21:43.667
We need to strike hard.
Front page headlines.

21:45.959 --> 21:49.334
Your cover includes a house
where you both live.

21:51.250 --> 21:52.334
Who's my partner?

21:55.834 --> 21:56.875
Guess.

21:59.625 --> 22:01.292
You're two lucky bastards.

22:02.125 --> 22:03.125
Lucky?

22:03.292 --> 22:05.292
Working for months in porno.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.375
You don't call that lucky?

22:09.542 --> 22:10.917
I don't know.

25:27.667 --> 25:28.959
Call the police!

25:29.125 --> 25:30.167
We call no one.

25:30.625 --> 25:32.250
We were attacked. Why not?

25:33.334 --> 25:35.375
The cops are always trouble. Inside.

25:44.292 --> 25:46.959
- Evening, gents. Have fun.
- Good evening.

25:48.209 --> 25:49.792
- Hi, Marcus.
- All good?

25:51.084 --> 25:51.750
Have fun.

26:19.125 --> 26:20.375
How goes it, Franck?

26:20.917 --> 26:22.125
- Serge.
- Hi.

26:22.292 --> 26:23.750
Welcome. Take a seat.

26:29.417 --> 26:31.667
We talked it over earlier

26:31.834 --> 26:34.959
and the guys who did it
work for no one here.

26:38.459 --> 26:40.667
Anybody in any trade could be involved.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.417
Maybe so, but why go after us?

26:45.042 --> 26:47.792
Why not? 6 months,
you've been in the business.

26:47.959 --> 26:50.042
- 10 years, for us guys.
- 10 years?

26:50.417 --> 26:51.250
20, you mean.

26:53.417 --> 26:56.042
Where were you all this time?
At the museum?

26:58.417 --> 27:00.417
I was in mail order, based in Lyon.

27:00.959 --> 27:01.917
Lyon?

27:02.750 --> 27:05.417
A friend of mine
runs a sex shop in Lyon. Walter?

27:05.625 --> 27:06.917
You know him?

27:07.459 --> 27:09.750
My pal in Paris, Jacques Chirac,
you know him?

27:15.584 --> 27:17.250
Those thugs might also be

27:17.500 --> 27:19.334
residents' associations

27:19.542 --> 27:20.792
or save-our-kids wackos.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.167
Or god knows. We've seen it all.

27:23.334 --> 27:24.167
Sure, absolutely.

27:24.750 --> 27:26.875
Why not get a bouncer
like my guy?

27:27.250 --> 27:28.834
We can't afford hired muscle.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.167
We won't give in.

27:31.584 --> 27:32.750
What was the damage?

27:33.625 --> 27:34.625
The damage?

27:37.500 --> 27:39.500
Everything. The whole place.

27:40.625 --> 27:43.375
Ventilation, cabins, lights...

27:44.292 --> 27:45.750
We're shut till it's done.

27:46.209 --> 27:47.667
What do we tell our girls?

27:47.959 --> 27:50.167
- Our employees.
- What do we tell them?

28:04.375 --> 28:06.959
- I had a great dream.
- Liar.

28:07.125 --> 28:08.125
It was wild.

28:09.417 --> 28:10.750
I'll tell you anyway.

28:12.084 --> 28:13.084
Can't he get that?

28:13.542 --> 28:15.125
Take over on the sausages.

28:15.959 --> 28:17.167
You're not picking up?

28:24.334 --> 28:25.417
Tomorrow, sure.

28:27.250 --> 28:28.625
Fine, thanks.

28:36.084 --> 28:39.417
Message from Vogel.
He wants to see us, find ways to help.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.709
This is it, we're in.

28:46.709 --> 28:47.500
You ok?

28:50.792 --> 28:53.084
Can smell your party out on the deck.

28:58.084 --> 29:01.250
Yeah, so I was out hitchhiking...

29:07.542 --> 29:09.834
Cut a deal and keep an eye on them.

29:10.709 --> 29:12.250
You're sure of your cover?

29:14.375 --> 29:15.667
Pretty much.

29:17.417 --> 29:19.459
Lacombe, can we lose the shades?

29:27.084 --> 29:28.959
And you kick back, relax!

29:29.959 --> 29:33.084
Your family is your business,
but call at least.

29:33.667 --> 29:35.750
Your wife's besieging the switchboard.

29:36.042 --> 29:37.167
My wife?

29:38.500 --> 29:39.459
My wife!

29:46.959 --> 29:48.750
I'll call her, it's just...

29:50.500 --> 29:52.250
I just forgot, but I'll call.

29:52.459 --> 29:54.459
Thank you, it'll give us a break.

29:56.084 --> 29:58.959
If you screw up,
you better watch your backs.

30:18.917 --> 30:20.667
- Look, the poster.
- It's cute.

30:20.834 --> 30:22.000
Go on in.

30:32.084 --> 30:34.334
Please, ladies, take a seat.

30:35.584 --> 30:36.959
Likewise.

30:39.375 --> 30:40.292
A drink, gents?

30:40.500 --> 30:41.459
- No, thanks.
- Sure.

30:41.625 --> 30:43.792
I could go for a scotch.

30:45.709 --> 30:47.125
You have your accounts?

30:47.459 --> 30:48.959
It's all in there.

30:50.834 --> 30:52.750
We made a rocky start.

30:52.959 --> 30:54.584
Now business is booming.

30:57.084 --> 30:58.584
All the money we make...

31:01.709 --> 31:04.959
We plow back into our films
and the firm.

31:05.167 --> 31:07.334
We're doing well,
as the attack proves.

31:11.292 --> 31:12.209
I want their names.

31:13.959 --> 31:15.542
We can't help you on that.

31:15.959 --> 31:18.834
You sell your films to other peep shows?

31:19.917 --> 31:21.959
No, only some by mail order.

31:22.125 --> 31:24.250
They're mainly to showcase our dancers.

31:24.417 --> 31:25.709
Very smart.

31:26.375 --> 31:27.209
That is smart.

31:28.792 --> 31:31.000
For the cabins,
you're looking at 50 grand.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.834
Plus ventilation and lighting.

31:34.042 --> 31:35.375
That's a lot of dough.

31:36.250 --> 31:37.542
We know that.

31:38.250 --> 31:41.167
If we expected to default,
we wouldn't be here.

31:42.875 --> 31:44.125
What's your collateral?

32:29.209 --> 32:31.125
Bravo, cutie pie. I'm hard.

32:31.834 --> 32:34.542
First time in years, watching porn.

32:55.500 --> 32:56.542
Nice work.

33:00.500 --> 33:03.334
There are 50-60 clubs in the provinces

33:03.875 --> 33:06.917
who'd pay 300 per reel of that stuff.

33:07.375 --> 33:08.334
The cost to you?

33:08.542 --> 33:09.500
1,500.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.125
Each.

33:11.792 --> 33:14.000
The firm's running a profit.

33:14.500 --> 33:18.500
But Galaxie Distribution
becomes your exclusive video supplier.

33:18.709 --> 33:21.667
With a 30% cut on each tape sold.

33:22.875 --> 33:24.292
You'll reopen in a week.

33:24.750 --> 33:26.834
We'll supply all the merchandise.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.500
Films, videos, gadgets...

33:30.667 --> 33:32.625
The store is yours or do you rent?

33:32.792 --> 33:33.917
It's ours.

33:34.625 --> 33:36.209
If you default,

33:36.417 --> 33:38.542
we'll take shares in the business.

33:39.250 --> 33:40.834
Georges, pull out a contract.

33:41.417 --> 33:45.167
Put that we're loaning them
100,000 francs

33:45.750 --> 33:47.167
at 20% over one year.

33:48.334 --> 33:50.000
And as collateral,

33:50.709 --> 33:52.209
the Mirodrome itself.

33:53.334 --> 33:56.625
One missed installment
and we become shareholders.

33:58.250 --> 34:01.417
I didn't expect conditions in our favor
but that's...

34:02.667 --> 34:04.042
No bank will back you.

34:07.875 --> 34:08.708
Anyone?

34:09.125 --> 34:09.958
With pleasure.

34:16.458 --> 34:17.583
What if...

34:18.375 --> 34:19.458
we're reattacked?

34:19.625 --> 34:21.792
We can lean on folks when we want.

34:22.083 --> 34:23.042
We're professionals.

34:39.958 --> 34:42.625
As partners,
we'll teach you to cheat the man

34:42.833 --> 34:44.167
and make money on the sly.

34:45.125 --> 34:47.500
How to become
kings of the shit heap!

34:59.709 --> 35:00.792
Can you stop?

35:01.500 --> 35:02.792
Fiddling.

35:05.834 --> 35:07.084
Here we go.

35:15.667 --> 35:17.959
I used to love stakeouts but now...

35:18.709 --> 35:19.750
Now what?

35:19.917 --> 35:21.334
They're shit boring!

35:29.625 --> 35:32.542
Maurice has fingers
in how many pies? Insane.

35:32.792 --> 35:34.000
Look.

35:35.209 --> 35:37.417
How long's this gonna take?

35:37.625 --> 35:39.375
I could do some coke.

35:45.917 --> 35:47.167
I wanna fuck.

35:47.334 --> 35:48.417
Me too.

35:49.542 --> 35:51.417
A real joker, that Maurice.

35:52.125 --> 35:53.917
We'll wipe the smile off his face.

35:59.625 --> 36:01.292
They only took 3 bags.

36:03.750 --> 36:05.792
They left cash in there, for sure.

36:07.584 --> 36:08.917
What do we do?

36:09.750 --> 36:12.375
We wait and see who rocks up in the car.

36:12.542 --> 36:13.667
Simple.

36:16.084 --> 36:19.334
One guy takes half the takings
and another the other half,

36:19.500 --> 36:21.417
so they're running a dual system.

36:21.584 --> 36:24.875
They declare part of it
and reinvest the other part.

36:25.084 --> 36:26.834
Basic money-laundering.

36:27.334 --> 36:29.167
The question is, through what?

36:35.667 --> 36:37.167
Got anything to smoke?

36:39.292 --> 36:41.667
Does Pinocchio have wooden balls?

36:42.625 --> 36:44.334
Nice, big toke. Go on.

36:45.084 --> 36:46.292
Yeah, for sure.

36:51.209 --> 36:54.042
It has something special, but what?

36:54.209 --> 36:55.667
Know what's special?

36:55.834 --> 36:57.209
It's on expenses.

36:57.750 --> 36:59.792
That's right, I was thinking...

36:59.959 --> 37:01.167
I knew it.

37:03.542 --> 37:06.042
- Fantastic weed.
- Only the best will do.

37:06.209 --> 37:08.709
You gotta use taxpayers' money wisely.

37:12.125 --> 37:13.709
Shit, it's good.

37:14.917 --> 37:15.792
Damn!

37:20.417 --> 37:21.417
Here.

37:24.209 --> 37:26.167
Just because I dragged on it?

37:26.334 --> 37:29.250
I don't share joints. Or toothbrushes.

37:30.875 --> 37:33.000
- You're fucking psycho.
- I'm not.

37:33.167 --> 37:34.375
Hands off my toothbrush.

37:36.709 --> 37:39.167
It's not something you think twice about.

37:39.667 --> 37:40.709
Meaning?

37:40.875 --> 37:42.250
You're a fat slob.

37:42.500 --> 37:43.542
I'm a slob?

37:43.709 --> 37:45.292
I spend my time at home,

37:45.459 --> 37:47.209
cleaning up your shit.

37:49.417 --> 37:51.542
Three weeks solid, taking out garbage.

37:52.709 --> 37:53.792
Like I give a shit.

37:53.959 --> 37:55.459
Ask the girls to do it.

37:55.625 --> 37:57.792
And wash the tub after you bang in it?

37:57.959 --> 38:00.084
What the fuck are you on?

38:00.250 --> 38:01.292
What's your problem?

38:01.459 --> 38:03.542
Know what, you're a freak.

38:03.709 --> 38:05.625
Cleanliness, germs, all that shit.

38:05.792 --> 38:07.709
Coffee even. Every cup, clean cup.

38:07.875 --> 38:08.959
- So?
- Who does that?

38:09.125 --> 38:10.500
Everybody does.

38:10.667 --> 38:12.792
Only you. In the whole wide world.

38:13.417 --> 38:14.792
You're a pain in the ass.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.167
I've had it up to here.

38:16.334 --> 38:17.792
- Yeah?
- You piss me off.

38:17.959 --> 38:21.084
I'll ask Bazin for a place of my own.

38:21.250 --> 38:24.750
Nobody giving me shit.
Banging chicks in my tub.

38:25.125 --> 38:26.500
And no grief from you.

38:26.667 --> 38:28.125
You can't live alone.

38:28.292 --> 38:30.875
I can't? I lived alone loads.

38:31.042 --> 38:32.250
- Loads of times!
- When?

38:32.417 --> 38:33.167
Never, right.

38:33.334 --> 38:35.375
When I had that place...

38:35.542 --> 38:36.875
Shit, the car's gone.

38:37.042 --> 38:38.125
Drive!

38:39.084 --> 38:39.875
Drive...

38:40.375 --> 38:42.042
Drive, please, you say.

38:42.209 --> 38:44.584
You lunkhead. Drive, please, will ya!

38:44.750 --> 38:45.625
There you go.

38:45.792 --> 38:47.084
I don't believe it.

38:47.417 --> 38:48.709
- What?
- It's stuck.

38:48.917 --> 38:51.250
- What, dammit?
- A can, under the pedal.

38:51.417 --> 38:53.000
I don't give a shit! Drive!

38:53.167 --> 38:53.959
Got it.

38:54.125 --> 38:55.084
Cool.

39:00.292 --> 39:02.250
Why did you open it?

39:03.000 --> 39:04.459
To drink it. Stupid question.

39:05.500 --> 39:06.209
Let's go.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.417
Yes, it's me.

39:10.250 --> 39:11.417
How's it going?

39:12.125 --> 39:13.084
Good, good.

39:14.084 --> 39:15.417
And the children?

39:16.875 --> 39:19.459
I know, sorry. I had no time to call.

39:20.125 --> 39:22.209
I said, I had no time to call.

39:23.959 --> 39:26.167
I don't have free use of the phone.

39:26.334 --> 39:27.709
I'm working here.

39:29.292 --> 39:30.584
No, I didn't say that.

39:30.750 --> 39:33.167
Don't wind me up or we'll get nowhere.

39:34.584 --> 39:36.584
Sorry, you're right. I apologize.

39:37.292 --> 39:38.250
Yes.

39:39.625 --> 39:41.625
I miss you all too, of course.

39:43.375 --> 39:44.500
Yes, I miss you.

39:46.250 --> 39:49.084
I'll come by sometime,
I don't know when.

39:50.709 --> 39:52.292
I promise I'll come. I promise.

40:01.417 --> 40:02.959
I know it's tricky.

40:03.959 --> 40:05.084
Watch out.

40:06.167 --> 40:08.042
- It's a game to turn me on?
- Maybe.

40:08.209 --> 40:09.667
Happy birthday!

40:14.042 --> 40:15.834
Happy birthday, buddy.

40:21.125 --> 40:22.375
My boyfriend.

40:22.542 --> 40:24.000
Monkey Cock!

40:26.542 --> 40:27.375
Thank you!

40:27.584 --> 40:28.667
Hakim...

40:30.875 --> 40:32.459
- Gotta blow 'em out?
- Sure.

40:32.625 --> 40:33.834
Here goes.

40:41.542 --> 40:42.584
Silence!

40:45.500 --> 40:46.500
He's gonna talk.

40:46.750 --> 40:47.750
Shut up!

40:47.917 --> 40:50.209
Monkey Cock, shut it!

40:50.417 --> 40:52.167
I have an announcement to make.

40:53.042 --> 40:57.334
I wanted to throw a party,
firstly for Serge's birthday.

41:01.250 --> 41:03.250
And also to celebrate

41:03.917 --> 41:05.750
the Mirodrome reopening next week!

41:10.000 --> 41:11.209
Great news.

41:14.292 --> 41:15.250
It's home!

41:17.000 --> 41:18.667
We're going home!

41:50.500 --> 41:51.459
I'm proud of her.

41:52.084 --> 41:53.209
Chloé?

41:53.667 --> 41:54.625
Too right, buddy.

41:54.792 --> 41:55.750
She's fab.

41:58.042 --> 42:00.292
I like the look of you. What do you do?

42:00.459 --> 42:01.959
I'm a drummer in a band.

42:02.125 --> 42:03.209
Cool.

42:07.334 --> 42:08.125
You wanna...

42:09.625 --> 42:10.542
No kidding.

42:11.500 --> 42:12.584
Let's go.

42:13.709 --> 42:14.667
Sure.

42:24.500 --> 42:25.542
Bust it out.

42:25.709 --> 42:28.042
- Come again?
- The coke. Bust it out.

42:28.542 --> 42:30.334
I thought you had some.

42:30.500 --> 42:32.167
You said, you wanna?

42:32.625 --> 42:33.667
So what?

42:34.334 --> 42:36.125
The guy with gear says that.

42:37.500 --> 42:38.500
You said, let's go.

42:38.667 --> 42:39.917
The guy with gear says that.

42:40.084 --> 42:43.125
Usually, sure.
But what you said trumps it.

42:43.292 --> 42:45.042
So you don't have any?

42:45.875 --> 42:46.542
Nope.

42:58.125 --> 42:59.209
You ok?

43:03.334 --> 43:05.417
The girls told me about your audition.

43:08.917 --> 43:10.167
Disappointed?

43:11.917 --> 43:13.417
Apply again next year.

43:13.834 --> 43:15.334
And to other drama schools.

43:16.292 --> 43:17.584
Yeah, sure.

43:23.959 --> 43:25.500
We're lucky to have you.

43:27.125 --> 43:30.750
I knew it first time I saw you
in the dressing room.

43:31.584 --> 43:33.834
I thought, let's hope she'll do it.

43:36.709 --> 43:38.584
I got lucky with you guys.

43:40.792 --> 43:42.834
No one's ever been so good to me.

43:49.209 --> 43:50.584
How about we score acid?

43:50.750 --> 43:51.792
Great.

43:52.375 --> 43:53.584
How much you got?

43:55.375 --> 43:58.084
- 100.
- Same here. That'll cover it.

43:58.500 --> 44:01.667
Meet you back here
in an hour with the gear.

44:01.834 --> 44:03.625
Here in one hour? Got it.

44:03.792 --> 44:05.250
- Let's do it.
- You bet.

44:08.209 --> 44:09.334
Well?

44:10.709 --> 44:11.834
Well what?

44:12.000 --> 44:14.959
- Don't just sit there.
- Aren't you gonna go buy it?

44:15.125 --> 44:16.792
- I thought you...
- Shit!

44:16.959 --> 44:20.000
- You said, how about we score...
- I know what I said.

44:41.584 --> 44:44.125
How come you never keep a chick?

44:45.750 --> 44:47.334
I'd love my wife to leave.

44:47.500 --> 44:48.542
She won't leave.

44:50.709 --> 44:51.667
She stays.

44:57.875 --> 44:59.792
But it can't be fun being you.

45:00.417 --> 45:01.459
With nothing, alone.

45:02.375 --> 45:04.459
You'll die alone like a piece of shit.

45:06.834 --> 45:08.084
I feel sorry for you.

45:10.292 --> 45:11.209
You're nuts.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.209
I don't have nothing.

45:14.667 --> 45:15.375
Kind of.

45:16.334 --> 45:17.917
I don't see it like that.

45:18.500 --> 45:20.625
I'm single but anything can happen.

45:23.209 --> 45:25.750
I feel for you. You don't get it.

45:25.917 --> 45:27.167
I feel sorry for you.

45:27.667 --> 45:28.417
See?

45:31.500 --> 45:33.417
You never stayed with a girl.

45:34.292 --> 45:36.084
- You're alone.
- Not true.

45:36.250 --> 45:38.500
I was with one girl for 3 years.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.375
We were deeply in love.

45:43.792 --> 45:46.209
Her name escapes me right now.

45:46.375 --> 45:47.834
But she was great.

45:50.125 --> 45:51.834
Can I get some help here?

45:56.959 --> 45:59.292
What are you guys staring at?

46:01.250 --> 46:03.292
Use your hands for once.

46:07.792 --> 46:09.875
You're a couple of idiots.

46:14.584 --> 46:16.000
This is killing me.

46:42.084 --> 46:43.167
Hey, sweetheart.

46:43.625 --> 46:46.625
- It's so good to see you. We missed you.
- Same here.

46:46.792 --> 46:49.042
- I'm kinda beat.
- Daddy!

46:49.500 --> 46:51.500
My darlings, my loves!

46:51.667 --> 46:52.959
How are you, champ?

46:53.125 --> 46:54.417
- You're home now?
- Coffee?

46:54.584 --> 46:56.834
I have to go back tomorrow night.

47:02.667 --> 47:03.834
That's mine!

47:05.042 --> 47:06.084
Children!

47:06.250 --> 47:07.584
Let me play!

47:08.709 --> 47:09.709
Mom!

47:10.167 --> 47:11.542
Pauline hit me.

47:11.709 --> 47:14.000
- Did you hit him?
- I didn't touch him.

47:14.167 --> 47:15.584
Stop squabbling now.

47:15.750 --> 47:18.334
Give me that recorder. Confiscated.

47:24.750 --> 47:27.667
What the hell's going on?
You're not ready?

47:31.334 --> 47:32.417
What's up?

47:34.500 --> 47:35.875
I'm pregnant.

47:40.625 --> 47:41.834
That's wonderful.

47:44.459 --> 47:45.542
How long already?

47:46.334 --> 47:48.334
Second month, barely showing.

47:49.084 --> 47:50.250
I'm happy for you.

47:53.625 --> 47:55.209
I told you, always knock.

47:55.375 --> 47:56.292
What is it?

47:56.459 --> 47:57.542
Somebody to see you.

47:57.709 --> 47:58.542
Coming.

47:58.709 --> 47:59.792
Congratulations.

48:00.250 --> 48:01.417
I'll be right back.

48:15.500 --> 48:16.667
How you doing?

48:17.542 --> 48:18.959
Wait for me inside.

48:19.500 --> 48:20.917
Call if you need me.

48:25.917 --> 48:27.834
Wasn't this a shoe store before?

48:31.917 --> 48:33.250
What do you want?

48:34.334 --> 48:35.459
Come with us.

48:38.834 --> 48:40.167
- What for?
- Don't ask.

48:43.917 --> 48:46.125
I can't, I'm busy. I just reopened.

48:46.292 --> 48:47.584
Thanks to who?

48:48.459 --> 48:49.709
With whose money?

48:51.459 --> 48:52.792
Do yourself a favor.

48:53.500 --> 48:54.875
I like you, you know.

48:57.750 --> 49:00.042
Come on, ride shotgun. Let's go.

49:12.125 --> 49:13.167
Where to?

49:40.375 --> 49:41.375
Stinks of manure.

49:42.084 --> 49:43.334
Slurry pits. It's different.

49:43.500 --> 49:45.042
Like I give a shit.

49:45.209 --> 49:47.209
I hate the countryside. Cows, hicks...

49:47.375 --> 49:49.792
Let's cut the crap, where are we going?

49:50.584 --> 49:51.917
Where are we going?

50:13.667 --> 50:15.042
You guys are in trouble.

50:15.209 --> 50:17.125
I gotta get back to the Mirodrome.

50:33.584 --> 50:34.917
That's better.

50:49.500 --> 50:50.209
Get in.

50:51.125 --> 50:52.542
I have something to show you.

51:28.209 --> 51:29.250
Get out.

51:54.584 --> 51:55.375
Listen.

52:19.125 --> 52:20.375
You're deathly pale.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
What did you think?

52:29.084 --> 52:30.292
I wanted you to hear it.

52:31.042 --> 52:31.959
The forest.

52:35.334 --> 52:36.667
It's cool,

52:36.834 --> 52:38.625
I'm just on edge right now.

52:38.792 --> 52:40.750
With the reopening...

52:41.959 --> 52:42.834
I can't sleep.

52:43.250 --> 52:44.500
You'll sleep at mine.

52:44.875 --> 52:46.500
We have matters to discuss.

52:48.334 --> 52:49.875
I can't leave the Mirodrome.

52:50.292 --> 52:51.417
Where's your buddy?

52:57.125 --> 52:57.917
15 all.

53:02.292 --> 53:03.167
We're happy.

53:03.334 --> 53:04.625
Is that not allowed?

53:07.334 --> 53:08.167
Play.

53:11.917 --> 53:12.584
Higher.

53:12.875 --> 53:14.125
Toss it higher.

53:14.500 --> 53:16.000
Or else you have no chance.

53:16.709 --> 53:18.375
Funny how in tennis, they...

53:23.292 --> 53:24.084
Yes!

53:25.125 --> 53:26.042
30-15.

53:26.584 --> 53:27.584
Come on!

53:29.125 --> 53:30.542
Love you, baby!

53:31.459 --> 53:32.917
Give 'em hell, sweets!

53:40.834 --> 53:42.084
She's stupid, so stupid.

53:42.250 --> 53:42.875
30 all.

53:43.834 --> 53:44.959
For fuck's sake!

53:45.750 --> 53:47.084
Quit serving at her!

53:47.500 --> 53:50.334
Give it width
or she knocks it straight back.

53:50.500 --> 53:51.334
Keep calm.

53:51.500 --> 53:53.250
- It's only a game.
- It's cool.

53:53.417 --> 53:54.625
They're children.

53:55.417 --> 53:57.709
She's stupid. Your partner's stupid.

53:57.875 --> 53:59.000
You're gonna lose.

53:59.167 --> 54:00.834
- Calm down.
- Can it, will ya!

54:01.000 --> 54:01.959
Dad!

54:03.417 --> 54:05.792
This is a tennis court, so calm down.

54:05.959 --> 54:07.834
I don't call this a tennis court.

54:09.584 --> 54:10.959
This is no tennis court.

54:14.209 --> 54:15.875
Watch what she's doing.

54:16.042 --> 54:17.042
They're children.

54:17.209 --> 54:18.959
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

54:21.042 --> 54:22.042
You've lost it?

54:22.250 --> 54:24.542
You're as bad as the stupid bitch now?

54:24.709 --> 54:25.584
Drop the bitch.

54:25.875 --> 54:26.875
Kick her out!

54:27.042 --> 54:29.250
She'll play better all on her own!

54:29.417 --> 54:31.459
You're useless. Just useless!

54:31.625 --> 54:33.584
You just whack it. It's bullshit!

54:33.750 --> 54:35.334
- Get out now!
- What?

54:35.667 --> 54:36.792
And don't come back.

54:39.042 --> 54:40.834
- It's a tennis match.
- Fuck this.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.167
Listen up.

54:42.334 --> 54:43.750
Call yourself a coach?

54:43.917 --> 54:45.125
Piece of shit, yeah!

54:45.292 --> 54:46.417
Get out of here!

54:46.584 --> 54:48.292
You're out of your mind.

54:48.459 --> 54:49.709
You're crap.

54:50.542 --> 54:51.459
Baby, honey...

54:51.625 --> 54:53.084
- Out!
- I'll wait in the car.

54:53.250 --> 54:55.084
- Out!
- Get your hands off me!

54:55.250 --> 54:57.250
- Get out and don't come back.
- Asshole.

54:57.417 --> 54:58.209
Go!

54:58.375 --> 55:01.917
Ask yourself
why you're only a coach, asshole!

55:02.084 --> 55:03.209
Beat it.

55:06.042 --> 55:08.334
Love ya, sweetheart. I'll be in the car.

55:08.500 --> 55:10.834
- No smoking here!
- Fuck off!

55:11.209 --> 55:12.917
That goes for you, too.

55:13.084 --> 55:14.125
Fuck you all!

55:48.917 --> 55:52.042
You look out of sorts.
You don't mind coming?

55:52.875 --> 55:54.500
No, I'm delighted I came.

55:54.667 --> 55:56.292
You don't look it.

55:57.042 --> 55:57.959
Repeat after me.

55:58.125 --> 55:59.625
I'm glad to be here.

56:00.917 --> 56:02.042
I'm glad to be here.

56:58.792 --> 57:01.709
Franck, meet Linda,
Madison and Pamela.

57:02.542 --> 57:05.000
They work for me,
spend the weekends here.

57:05.167 --> 57:05.834
We're family.

57:08.542 --> 57:09.250
Evening.

57:16.125 --> 57:17.250
You get the bedroom.

57:20.542 --> 57:21.542
Who's that?

57:22.584 --> 57:23.834
That? Jesus.

57:25.709 --> 57:26.917
Who did you think?

57:27.417 --> 57:28.500
It's a photo.

57:30.417 --> 57:32.250
Yeah. Recognize him anywhere.

57:33.625 --> 57:35.042
Maurice, it's a photo.

57:36.000 --> 57:36.750
Yeah.

57:37.292 --> 57:38.292
Crazy, right?

57:43.542 --> 57:45.625
I don't really recognize him.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.542
Make yourself at home.

57:54.250 --> 57:55.167
And look.

57:56.375 --> 57:57.375
A swing.

57:58.459 --> 57:59.625
The shower's there.

57:59.792 --> 58:02.084
I'll lend you a shirt or go au naturel.

58:02.334 --> 58:03.834
No mosquitoes here.

58:04.167 --> 58:05.167
C'mon, baby.

58:28.084 --> 58:28.959
Your shirt.

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
Thanks.

58:34.167 --> 58:35.459
What's that?

58:36.334 --> 58:37.625
You were a Para?

58:38.042 --> 58:40.959
That's a long time ago, in another life.

58:42.625 --> 58:44.875
One of my actors has the same.

58:45.042 --> 58:46.000
A Pole.

58:46.167 --> 58:48.792
Shit at dialogue
but a walking hardon.

58:48.959 --> 58:49.750
Like that.

58:52.250 --> 58:53.709
Paras are the real deal.

58:55.750 --> 58:57.375
Pamela, come in.

58:58.875 --> 59:00.250
She has a favor to ask.

59:02.292 --> 59:04.209
Go on, ask him, cupcake.

59:04.375 --> 59:06.125
When you come over shy like that,

59:06.292 --> 59:08.625
it's as if you're from the sticks.

59:08.917 --> 59:10.209
No, but he just arrived.

59:10.375 --> 59:11.417
So what?

59:12.542 --> 59:14.250
Can Pamela shower with you?

59:14.667 --> 59:16.250
She'd really like that.

59:18.584 --> 59:19.292
I dunno...

59:23.209 --> 59:24.209
Relax, buddy.

59:24.375 --> 59:26.625
You're unsure I'll let you bang Pamela?

59:26.792 --> 59:30.292
You bet you can bang Pamela,
or she'll think you don't like her.

59:45.875 --> 59:48.375
- I got this tablecloth.
- Beautiful.

59:48.542 --> 59:49.959
- Not bad.
- Provençal?

59:50.209 --> 59:51.667
And this for Jeremy.

59:54.125 --> 59:57.959
Your little Pauline threw a tantrum
to get the top she wanted.

59:58.334 --> 59:59.209
Really?

59:59.375 --> 01:00:01.750
And not the one I picked out for her.

01:00:02.542 --> 01:00:06.125
I've no idea if you're going to like this
but here goes...

01:00:06.667 --> 01:00:07.792
A teddy.

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:09.959
Pale yellow's just...

01:00:10.125 --> 01:00:11.834
- You'll look sexy in it.
- "Sexy"?

01:00:13.917 --> 01:00:15.209
You'll look beautiful.

01:00:16.292 --> 01:00:18.084
And the blouse, you didn't say?

01:00:19.084 --> 01:00:21.500
It's got it all, looks awesome on you.

01:00:22.042 --> 01:00:22.875
Are we done?

01:00:25.292 --> 01:00:26.584
You don't like it, do you?

01:00:27.792 --> 01:00:29.792
I like it a lot, but I'll be late.

01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:31.459
All this bores you.

01:00:31.625 --> 01:00:33.250
No, it doesn't, but you know,

01:00:33.417 --> 01:00:35.792
towels and stuff, we could discuss...

01:00:35.959 --> 01:00:38.709
- "Towels and stuff"?
- Don't take it like that!

01:00:41.459 --> 01:00:43.750
Sweetheart, don't look at me that way.

01:00:45.709 --> 01:00:47.084
Go on, run to your buddy.

01:00:48.125 --> 01:00:49.750
Not my buddy, my partner.

01:00:51.709 --> 01:00:54.500
You think we spend all our time partying?

01:00:57.334 --> 01:00:58.292
Not a bit.

01:01:02.709 --> 01:01:04.542
If only you knew, I'm sick of it.

01:01:05.375 --> 01:01:07.792
I want to be with you and the kids.

01:01:08.375 --> 01:01:09.417
Our life.

01:01:09.709 --> 01:01:10.542
I love you.

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:12.209
I love you.

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:22.625
Cocaine, the breakfast of...

01:01:22.959 --> 01:01:24.209
Champions!

01:01:25.417 --> 01:01:26.792
What about my shirt?

01:01:28.167 --> 01:01:28.875
Sit.

01:01:29.875 --> 01:01:31.084
You like creamed anchovy?

01:01:32.292 --> 01:01:34.667
Creamed anchovy goes with rye bread.

01:01:34.834 --> 01:01:36.334
Watch carefully. Knife.

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:37.459
Cut a slice.

01:01:38.584 --> 01:01:39.500
Looking good.

01:01:39.667 --> 01:01:42.334
The hard part is keeping it straight.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.125
There we go. See this tube?

01:01:46.375 --> 01:01:50.375
One squeeze and here comes
yummy creamed anchovy,

01:01:50.542 --> 01:01:52.750
nice and brown, nice and gooey.

01:01:53.709 --> 01:01:55.334
Looks like shit.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.709
Wonderful, isn't it?

01:01:56.875 --> 01:01:58.500
Now, let's spread.

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:00.334
Ok, baby?

01:02:03.667 --> 01:02:04.417
Here, eat.

01:02:04.584 --> 01:02:05.375
Taste it.

01:02:05.542 --> 01:02:06.750
Eat it, pumpkin.

01:02:10.542 --> 01:02:11.792
Good, isn't it?

01:02:12.834 --> 01:02:13.959
Like it?

01:02:15.584 --> 01:02:17.667
I like you. Like you a lot.

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:18.709
More?

01:02:19.334 --> 01:02:20.250
I'm good.

01:02:20.584 --> 01:02:21.625
Now for the coke!

01:02:21.792 --> 01:02:23.500
We're taking cocaine!

01:02:24.125 --> 01:02:25.000
Where is it?

01:02:25.167 --> 01:02:26.250
Here, popsy.

01:02:26.417 --> 01:02:27.209
Coffee?

01:02:27.375 --> 01:02:30.042
I have an Italian percolator,
makes fab coffee!

01:02:30.209 --> 01:02:31.209
You play Mastermind?

01:02:31.375 --> 01:02:32.209
Mastermind!

01:02:35.125 --> 01:02:36.000
Stop that.

01:02:39.417 --> 01:02:40.334
When's my turn?

01:02:44.959 --> 01:02:46.542
Sorry, Maurice, but you lose.

01:02:46.709 --> 01:02:48.667
Unbelievable, you fucked it up.

01:02:49.459 --> 01:02:51.542
She's behind, showing you the colors.

01:02:51.709 --> 01:02:52.709
Your turn, Pam.

01:02:53.459 --> 01:02:54.500
Return match.

01:02:54.667 --> 01:02:56.542
That was it. Pam, your turn.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.375
That wasn't it. Bullshit!

01:02:58.542 --> 01:03:00.125
That's two games, Momo.

01:03:00.292 --> 01:03:02.209
Pamela hasn't played yet.

01:03:02.917 --> 01:03:04.709
You're ganging up on me tonight?

01:03:05.167 --> 01:03:05.875
It's cool.

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:07.292
What's up?

01:03:07.459 --> 01:03:08.667
- Not cool!
- Calm down.

01:03:08.834 --> 01:03:10.292
I will not calm down!

01:03:11.459 --> 01:03:12.625
It's only a game.

01:03:12.792 --> 01:03:14.834
It's not only a game. You're wrong!

01:03:19.667 --> 01:03:20.500
Fuck this!

01:03:21.625 --> 01:03:22.459
Quitter!

01:03:22.625 --> 01:03:23.334
Linda...

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:24.834
- Never mind.
- Just play.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.459
Madison, take her place.

01:03:27.875 --> 01:03:28.667
You start.

01:03:28.834 --> 01:03:29.584
Alright.

01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:30.584
Who's playing?

01:03:31.209 --> 01:03:32.459
C'mon, play.

01:03:32.917 --> 01:03:34.459
Girls, let's play.

01:03:34.875 --> 01:03:37.167
Come on! Empty those things.

01:03:37.334 --> 01:03:38.875
Choose your colors.

01:03:39.042 --> 01:03:40.042
Let's go.

01:03:40.792 --> 01:03:42.250
Major-league Mastermind.

01:03:42.625 --> 01:03:43.834
Empty your things.

01:03:47.917 --> 01:03:49.125
What was that?

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.500
I found this by the coats.

01:03:51.667 --> 01:03:52.709
It just went off.

01:03:52.875 --> 01:03:53.667
Just like that.

01:03:53.834 --> 01:03:55.584
- No way.
- Yes, just like that.

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:56.625
- Give.
- No.

01:03:56.792 --> 01:03:58.042
- Yes.
- No.

01:03:58.209 --> 01:03:59.375
Give it to me!

01:03:59.542 --> 01:04:00.542
- No.
- Yes!

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.042
Watch out.

01:04:02.292 --> 01:04:03.459
That one wasn't me.

01:04:03.959 --> 01:04:05.084
You have a nerve.

01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:06.375
Can't you hold a gun?

01:04:06.792 --> 01:04:07.709
It's not hard.

01:04:13.792 --> 01:04:14.584
He's nuts!

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:15.667
Know what?

01:04:15.834 --> 01:04:17.375
Herons are a plague here.

01:04:17.542 --> 01:04:19.209
Tomorrow, we'll go hunting.

01:04:19.917 --> 01:04:20.792
Yes?

01:04:21.459 --> 01:04:22.417
For sure.

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:40.125
Ok, Maurice?

01:04:51.334 --> 01:04:52.625
Joker. I win.

01:04:52.792 --> 01:04:55.292
- That's not a joker.
- We can cheat.

01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:57.584
You play by the rules now?

01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:59.334
I had a joker, too.

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:01.000
- Sure you did.
- We believe you.

01:05:01.167 --> 01:05:02.000
Stop it.

01:05:02.167 --> 01:05:03.959
I fell in love with a teacher.

01:05:04.292 --> 01:05:05.709
That's a classic.

01:05:05.875 --> 01:05:07.250
She was a woman.

01:05:08.209 --> 01:05:09.709
Alright, teacher lady.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.084
It's Momo.

01:05:11.834 --> 01:05:12.709
What? Where?

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.417
You ok, Maurice? Where'd you go?

01:05:16.584 --> 01:05:17.750
Help. Dad's flat out.

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:24.667
Follow me.

01:05:24.834 --> 01:05:26.750
What do you mean, flat out?

01:05:41.375 --> 01:05:42.209
He's dead.

01:05:43.084 --> 01:05:44.292
Help me.

01:05:44.834 --> 01:05:45.709
What happened?

01:05:46.209 --> 01:05:47.292
How should I know?

01:05:49.875 --> 01:05:52.625
His neighbor found him
outside his house.

01:05:53.667 --> 01:05:55.459
He died with his boots on.

01:05:59.042 --> 01:06:01.250
Girls, go get champagne and glasses!

01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:04.667
We'll bury him.

01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:06.750
Find him a nice spot

01:06:06.917 --> 01:06:08.084
under the trees.

01:06:09.084 --> 01:06:10.000
Really? Here?

01:06:10.167 --> 01:06:12.084
Sure, that whole performance...

01:06:12.584 --> 01:06:15.167
Funeral, choose a grave, buy a coffin.

01:06:15.334 --> 01:06:17.209
That bullshit pisses me off.

01:06:17.834 --> 01:06:19.875
This way, it's a lot faster,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.334
more hygienic and cheaper.

01:06:25.709 --> 01:06:27.042
Want some, kitten?

01:06:33.459 --> 01:06:34.917
We already finished

01:06:35.584 --> 01:06:36.709
five!

01:06:43.209 --> 01:06:45.417
That's good, we can put him in.

01:06:45.584 --> 01:06:46.334
Pam!

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.625
Fetch the bible from the living room.

01:06:51.584 --> 01:06:53.542
One, two, three!

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:55.875
To my father,

01:06:56.042 --> 01:06:58.584
the last independent farmer!

01:07:02.292 --> 01:07:05.667
Now for a ceremony he'd love!

01:07:05.834 --> 01:07:07.792
He danced his whole life!

01:07:11.250 --> 01:07:12.417
Awesome!

01:07:14.125 --> 01:07:15.292
It's beautiful.

01:07:19.125 --> 01:07:20.500
Come on, Franck.

01:07:21.584 --> 01:07:22.667
Come on!

01:09:12.917 --> 01:09:15.750
Do you want to work
as a producer for me?

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.209
Maybe we could discuss the idea sometime.

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.084
Your clubs don't need us.

01:09:24.667 --> 01:09:26.209
No, clearly not.

01:09:26.375 --> 01:09:28.500
A film. A real one.

01:09:32.375 --> 01:09:34.334
That's why you brought me here?

01:09:37.084 --> 01:09:39.584
I appreciate your trust but...

01:09:41.334 --> 01:09:42.709
We're amateurs.

01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:46.584
We'll stick to our little movies.

01:09:47.042 --> 01:09:49.084
I'm not sure we could do it.

01:09:49.334 --> 01:09:50.417
I think so.

01:09:51.625 --> 01:09:52.875
You'd line up

01:09:53.459 --> 01:09:55.250
a pro, a big-name girl,

01:09:55.917 --> 01:09:57.209
and some fluffers.

01:09:57.584 --> 01:09:59.584
And your stable of chicks.

01:10:00.834 --> 01:10:02.750
The business needs new girls.

01:10:03.542 --> 01:10:05.209
Especially your blonde...

01:10:06.459 --> 01:10:07.375
She's the future.

01:10:08.792 --> 01:10:09.875
Caprice.

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:14.584
I don't know...

01:10:16.417 --> 01:10:18.917
I don't know how far she's ready to go.

01:10:19.542 --> 01:10:21.542
We'd sign her up, exclusivity,

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:23.000
the whole shebang.

01:10:26.417 --> 01:10:29.084
Photos, centerfolds, magazine spreads.

01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:31.584
Caprice, the hot new bombshell.

01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:34.917
And we'd put posters up in our stores.

01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:42.959
Look after her.

01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:46.000
That's what I do.

01:10:47.792 --> 01:10:49.417
I really love my girls.

01:10:52.167 --> 01:10:53.334
I adopted them.

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:55.250
I want to be their all.

01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:58.000
Father, brother, lover.

01:11:00.334 --> 01:11:01.500
Understand?

01:11:02.125 --> 01:11:04.167
That's how you treat your girls.

01:11:05.167 --> 01:11:06.459
They're your family.

01:11:10.917 --> 01:11:12.125
Anyway, porno

01:11:12.292 --> 01:11:14.459
is the coolest movie biz to work in.

01:11:29.792 --> 01:11:31.250
Bruno Fratoni.

01:11:35.125 --> 01:11:36.292
Lionel Marchalaud.

01:11:39.375 --> 01:11:40.709
Georges Chalva.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.292
Here's our star
and his main associate...

01:11:48.042 --> 01:11:49.584
André Dapisse and Maurice Vogel.

01:11:52.875 --> 01:11:55.542
We need to catch them
red-handed for the DA.

01:11:55.709 --> 01:11:59.750
Money-laundering charges will need
to stand up against their hotshot lawyers.

01:12:00.084 --> 01:12:02.209
The scumbag's peep and sex shop profits

01:12:02.375 --> 01:12:04.000
will be recycled in a film.

01:12:04.167 --> 01:12:05.584
Cash will change hands.

01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:07.584
From Vogel

01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:11.125
to detectives Lacombe and Aimos,
who produce for him.

01:12:12.042 --> 01:12:13.292
The mission from hell!

01:12:13.459 --> 01:12:16.500
We sit tight
until we witness the transaction.

01:12:16.792 --> 01:12:19.209
No cash means no proof, no arrests.

01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:21.459
The bastards are longtime targets.

01:12:22.875 --> 01:12:24.667
With this film, we'll nail them.

01:12:30.667 --> 01:12:31.750
Yes, turn now.

01:12:31.917 --> 01:12:33.500
Profile, show us your boobs.

01:12:33.667 --> 01:12:35.459
- Is this good?
- Magnificent!

01:12:35.625 --> 01:12:36.542
It's all good.

01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:39.667
Yes!

01:12:40.084 --> 01:12:41.125
Great!

01:12:42.375 --> 01:12:43.375
Hang on...

01:12:43.542 --> 01:12:45.375
Sublime. Caress your breasts.

01:12:45.542 --> 01:12:46.750
Here's what we do...

01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:51.292
We contract kiddo there for one film.

01:12:51.459 --> 01:12:53.250
Paid 1,000 francs per scene.

01:12:53.417 --> 01:12:55.709
Galaxie holds the rights to the material.

01:12:58.042 --> 01:13:00.834
If the camera likes her
and she likes it,

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.834
we'll sign her up for three films.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.667
Paid 1,500-2,000 francs per day.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:06.792
Not bad.

01:13:07.625 --> 01:13:09.959
There's more. If all goes well, buddy...

01:13:10.125 --> 01:13:11.959
If all goes well, we'll see.

01:13:13.125 --> 01:13:14.084
Just so you know,

01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:16.292
bestiality, watersports, sodomy...

01:13:16.792 --> 01:13:18.375
Forget it, we're not in.

01:13:18.542 --> 01:13:19.459
Like we care.

01:13:20.834 --> 01:13:22.250
One last thing...

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.792
I hope this isn't a deal-breaker...

01:13:27.375 --> 01:13:30.959
We want Caprice to have
a great career with us, so shoot.

01:13:31.709 --> 01:13:32.750
Who plays her driver?

01:13:33.584 --> 01:13:35.959
We haven't cast anyone yet.

01:13:36.125 --> 01:13:37.667
Marc Boni ring any bells?

01:13:39.292 --> 01:13:40.084
That's you.

01:13:42.292 --> 01:13:43.875
A highly talented actor.

01:13:45.334 --> 01:13:47.667
Look, you know, why not?

01:13:47.917 --> 01:13:48.709
Yup, why not?

01:13:51.917 --> 01:13:53.167
That calls for a drink!

01:13:53.334 --> 01:13:54.834
We have work to do, thanks.

01:13:56.667 --> 01:13:57.792
See you on set.

01:13:58.167 --> 01:13:58.917
Later, guys.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.084
Two.

01:14:07.959 --> 01:14:10.459
Three.
Memorize your numbers.

01:14:10.834 --> 01:14:12.125
Four. That way...

01:14:13.417 --> 01:14:15.084
we call you and you're there.

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:16.209
Six.

01:14:25.959 --> 01:14:28.125
What are you diddling there, sir?

01:14:28.792 --> 01:14:30.500
A little patience is good.

01:14:31.125 --> 01:14:32.250
Ten.

01:14:33.167 --> 01:14:34.084
Shit.

01:14:34.625 --> 01:14:35.417
11.

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:36.625
We're good.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:37.959
8's a pro.

01:14:38.125 --> 01:14:40.500
I never worked with him, but he's good.

01:14:40.667 --> 01:14:41.875
Number 8!

01:14:45.334 --> 01:14:47.084
- You've been in films?
- Six.

01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:49.417
John Baccardi. I brought photos.

01:14:50.250 --> 01:14:53.209
The best standing buttfucker
with facial to order.

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:58.875
- Last movie?
- Trench Warfare.

01:14:59.042 --> 01:15:00.084
You saw it?

01:15:00.375 --> 01:15:01.459
Yeah, it's good.

01:15:02.459 --> 01:15:04.459
It's a one-week shoot, 500 a day.

01:15:04.625 --> 01:15:05.959
You don't pay per scene?

01:15:06.125 --> 01:15:07.292
Only for minor roles.

01:15:07.459 --> 01:15:08.417
Who's in it?

01:15:08.584 --> 01:15:11.084
Besides Lola Herrera, all new girls.

01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:13.834
Lola Herrera? I love her!

01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:16.000
It's my dream to work with her.

01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:17.417
Let's see.

01:15:28.917 --> 01:15:30.875
Not bad for the Count, right?

01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:33.875
Fine, yeah.

01:15:36.667 --> 01:15:37.500
See you soon.

01:15:38.125 --> 01:15:39.042
Thanks.

01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:41.584
So long.

01:15:42.292 --> 01:15:44.625
Kids, I gotta go. Make a great film.

01:15:44.792 --> 01:15:47.000
Not too good or it won't sell.

01:15:58.084 --> 01:15:59.292
You're a true beauty.

01:15:59.459 --> 01:16:00.500
Thank you.

01:16:00.834 --> 01:16:01.917
What scene are you in?

01:16:02.084 --> 01:16:03.500
I have one with you.

01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:07.250
I did doggie twice in my last,

01:16:07.417 --> 01:16:09.250
so maybe you'd mix it up.

01:16:09.417 --> 01:16:10.625
I'd hate to be typecast.

01:16:10.792 --> 01:16:11.875
Since we're all here,

01:16:12.042 --> 01:16:14.042
let's do a speed run.

01:16:14.792 --> 01:16:15.917
A speed run?

01:16:16.084 --> 01:16:17.000
A read-through.

01:16:17.167 --> 01:16:20.375
Some roles
have more lines than others so...

01:16:20.792 --> 01:16:22.292
My apologies for that.

01:16:22.584 --> 01:16:23.584
Sorry.

01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:25.875
So, picture the scene.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.167
Exterior, night.

01:16:28.334 --> 01:16:29.584
A castle.

01:16:30.167 --> 01:16:31.417
Wreathed in fog.

01:16:33.334 --> 01:16:34.709
A limousine pulls up.

01:16:34.875 --> 01:16:36.459
A driver steps out.

01:16:37.542 --> 01:16:40.417
He opens the door
for two ladies in ballgowns.

01:16:41.834 --> 01:16:43.875
Nathalie touches Savannah's arm

01:16:44.042 --> 01:16:45.459
and points to the castle...

01:16:46.292 --> 01:16:48.292
I've never been inside a castle.

01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:54.459
- Like that?
- What?

01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:56.500
"I've never been inside a castle."

01:16:57.084 --> 01:16:57.959
A problem?

01:16:58.792 --> 01:17:00.000
You're in awe!

01:17:00.167 --> 01:17:01.834
You've never seen a castle.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.209
You're dazzled.

01:17:03.375 --> 01:17:05.584
Something in your eyes, seeing a...

01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:07.625
A castle. Your first ever!

01:17:07.917 --> 01:17:09.167
I've seen lots.

01:17:15.209 --> 01:17:18.334
I have to act like I'd never seen
a castle in my life?

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:19.292
Bingo.

01:17:19.459 --> 01:17:20.292
I get it.

01:17:21.042 --> 01:17:22.709
That's why you say,

01:17:22.875 --> 01:17:24.625
I've never been inside a castle.

01:17:26.334 --> 01:17:27.459
From the top.

01:17:36.792 --> 01:17:38.125
What you doing in there?

01:17:42.084 --> 01:17:43.917
I'm re-reading the script.

01:17:49.125 --> 01:17:51.209
I know exactly what you're doing.

01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:54.167
I don't get it, we're working. Why this?

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:56.625
Come off it.

01:17:58.750 --> 01:18:00.959
You're not paid to be my best friend.

01:18:02.625 --> 01:18:05.834
I like to party as much as the next guy,
but like this?

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000
All alone in the crapper, dammit.

01:18:09.834 --> 01:18:11.917
Why? Why are you taking that now?

01:18:16.375 --> 01:18:18.000
Because it's there.

01:18:24.375 --> 01:18:27.167
Nathalie, Savannah and Solange

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:31.959
complete their journey in time
in dresses from 1900.

01:18:33.459 --> 01:18:36.875
They escape from the castle
by sliding down

01:18:37.042 --> 01:18:39.042
a rope of bras and panties.

01:18:39.209 --> 01:18:42.209
They land on the grass outside
at first light.

01:18:43.042 --> 01:18:44.209
They start running

01:18:44.375 --> 01:18:46.959
with a pack of dobermans on their heels.

01:18:48.625 --> 01:18:50.667
They succeed in getting away.

01:18:51.167 --> 01:18:51.875
The End.

01:18:52.042 --> 01:18:53.084
Magnificent.

01:18:56.417 --> 01:18:57.584
Wonderful.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.584
Now let's make it.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.250
- Look!
- We're here.

01:19:23.459 --> 01:19:24.417
It's perfect.

01:19:24.584 --> 01:19:26.292
It's pornfect, you mean.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.417
Beautiful hydrangeas.

01:19:31.917 --> 01:19:33.167
Here we are!

01:19:36.834 --> 01:19:38.417
Thank you, Pachard.

01:19:51.459 --> 01:19:52.917
Stop it, you're...

01:19:53.709 --> 01:19:54.792
You're knitting?

01:19:55.334 --> 01:19:56.375
Sure, she's pregnant.

01:19:57.167 --> 01:19:58.750
Yeah, very sexy.

01:19:58.917 --> 01:20:00.417
We're here to make a film

01:20:00.584 --> 01:20:02.042
and you're knitting?

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:03.834
Come on, she's pregnant.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.500
The biggest turn-off ever is knitting.

01:20:06.667 --> 01:20:07.750
I'm sorry.

01:20:15.667 --> 01:20:16.584
What's that?

01:20:16.875 --> 01:20:18.459
I did it yesterday. Like it?

01:20:19.042 --> 01:20:20.000
It's disgusting.

01:20:20.167 --> 01:20:21.209
Unfilmable.

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:22.792
Really?

01:20:23.334 --> 01:20:24.834
It's abominable.

01:20:25.167 --> 01:20:26.459
I had no idea.

01:20:26.625 --> 01:20:29.000
It's all the rage. The landing strip.

01:20:29.167 --> 01:20:30.667
The landing strip?

01:20:34.584 --> 01:20:35.375
Look.

01:20:36.792 --> 01:20:38.084
That's sick.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
I told you not to do it, didn't I?

01:20:41.542 --> 01:20:43.084
- I guess.
- Let's see...

01:20:47.167 --> 01:20:49.084
It's hard being pregnant in porn.

01:20:49.709 --> 01:20:51.625
So why didn't you adopt?

01:20:51.792 --> 01:20:53.834
With my genes? Are you nuts?

01:20:54.792 --> 01:20:56.375
The owners are coming Wednesday.

01:20:56.542 --> 01:20:59.042
I scheduled
the dialogue scenes that day.

01:20:59.667 --> 01:21:02.334
I won't be here. I have no dialogue.

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:03.584
Exactly.

01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:05.834
That's lucky.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.167
- How come?
- My memory's useless.

01:21:08.875 --> 01:21:10.084
Same here.

01:21:15.584 --> 01:21:17.459
I blame my divorce on nudism.

01:21:17.625 --> 01:21:18.750
I love nudism.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.709
My wife was scared
of catching cold.

01:21:34.292 --> 01:21:35.792
How's your room?

01:21:36.542 --> 01:21:38.875
If I take it doggie style, nobody'll...

01:21:59.375 --> 01:22:00.500
What's that?

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:03.167
Champagne and armagnac.

01:22:03.334 --> 01:22:04.834
I just discovered it.

01:22:05.625 --> 01:22:06.625
Let me try.

01:22:13.709 --> 01:22:14.667
Not bad.

01:22:15.125 --> 01:22:16.209
Fix you one?

01:22:23.542 --> 01:22:25.500
You think I could be someone special?

01:22:26.917 --> 01:22:28.167
Sure, why?

01:22:29.167 --> 01:22:30.250
I don't know.

01:22:37.459 --> 01:22:40.250
What does Marc tell you to do
while he's playing?

01:22:40.917 --> 01:22:43.084
Sit in your room waiting for him?

01:22:44.292 --> 01:22:45.250
No.

01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:47.292
He's cool with everything.

01:22:47.917 --> 01:22:49.459
As long as I'm not bored.

01:23:02.292 --> 01:23:04.542
Let's not make it an excuse to flirt.

01:23:09.375 --> 01:23:11.125
Not on this film, at least.

01:23:12.334 --> 01:23:13.459
Definitely not.

01:23:15.209 --> 01:23:16.667
Especially not tonight.

01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:19.042
Not on your life.

01:23:23.709 --> 01:23:26.625
Not out of sight, so no one finds out.

01:23:30.167 --> 01:23:32.417
I won't walk you to your room either.

01:23:33.209 --> 01:23:34.417
I'd rather die.

01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:42.375
Jerome, where's my room?

01:25:42.542 --> 01:25:43.834
You're just there.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.584
- Seen Sergio?
- No, I haven't seen Sergio.

01:25:52.834 --> 01:25:56.209
Don't go all the way,
save it for tomorrow. On set at 10!

01:25:56.375 --> 01:25:57.667
Jerome, look.

01:25:59.042 --> 01:26:00.500
Dick chopper!

01:26:00.875 --> 01:26:01.917
Great.

01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:09.625
Surprise!

01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:11.500
Fuck!

01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:21.709
You ok, John?

01:26:22.334 --> 01:26:23.334
Great, thanks.

01:26:26.834 --> 01:26:28.000
All alone?

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:29.750
For now, yeah.

01:26:30.417 --> 01:26:31.417
Suits me fine.

01:26:47.209 --> 01:26:48.292
Holy shit!

01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:54.709
I gotta go.

01:27:02.042 --> 01:27:03.334
Shut the door.

01:27:05.709 --> 01:27:06.792
Want me to send someone?

01:27:06.959 --> 01:27:07.959
No, I'm good.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.542
There's not a sound.

01:28:33.834 --> 01:28:35.459
I couldn't get to sleep.

01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:37.959
It shows on my mug?

01:28:38.792 --> 01:28:40.417
I shot a film on video once.

01:28:40.584 --> 01:28:42.875
Horrible. Every wrinkle jumped out.

01:28:43.042 --> 01:28:45.042
Maybe I'm in rural depression.

01:28:45.209 --> 01:28:48.375
They plastered makeup
on a boob pimple for hours.

01:28:51.084 --> 01:28:52.209
How am I?

01:28:52.375 --> 01:28:53.500
Superb.

01:28:53.959 --> 01:28:56.959
As long as I have a face,
you'll have a seat.

01:28:57.417 --> 01:28:58.625
You charmer.

01:29:00.875 --> 01:29:02.334
Thanks for the heads-up.

01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:05.084
Bob, how's it looking?

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:08.834
- I'm used to it.
- It's always tricky.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:09.709
Higher.

01:29:12.375 --> 01:29:13.209
Lower.

01:29:14.209 --> 01:29:15.250
Higher.

01:29:17.375 --> 01:29:18.250
You're so slow.

01:29:18.417 --> 01:29:20.500
Leave it like that. It's too steep.

01:29:20.667 --> 01:29:21.834
You know, toots...

01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:25.084
In this scene, the boom's high up,

01:29:25.250 --> 01:29:27.167
so give it some decibels.

01:29:27.334 --> 01:29:28.750
I hear you.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.459
Pachard, we gotta get moving.

01:29:37.334 --> 01:29:38.959
What the hell are they doing?

01:29:39.125 --> 01:29:40.584
- Nobody knows.
- We're good.

01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:43.292
We're not good.
People are farting around.

01:29:43.459 --> 01:29:44.875
The owners are here.

01:29:46.250 --> 01:29:47.750
Is it Wednesday?

01:29:47.917 --> 01:29:49.792
- So how come?
- With their kid.

01:29:49.959 --> 01:29:50.875
Shit.

01:29:51.125 --> 01:29:52.209
What do we do?

01:29:53.709 --> 01:29:54.959
Hold on a second.

01:29:55.917 --> 01:29:57.000
Get her dressed.

01:29:57.167 --> 01:29:59.209
To start with. You found Caprice?

01:29:59.375 --> 01:30:00.792
Sure. I woke up Franck.

01:30:00.959 --> 01:30:02.000
Franck? How come...

01:30:02.167 --> 01:30:04.875
We're good to go. People, please.

01:30:43.042 --> 01:30:44.167
It's 9 already.

01:30:45.334 --> 01:30:46.125
Shit.

01:30:46.292 --> 01:30:48.125
- You didn't wake me.
- No worries.

01:30:50.375 --> 01:30:52.292
Get ready and hurry downstairs.

01:30:56.625 --> 01:30:58.209
We'll take good care of you.

01:30:58.375 --> 01:30:59.334
You're sure?

01:30:59.917 --> 01:31:01.625
You'll take me under your wing?

01:31:02.125 --> 01:31:03.084
Yeah.

01:31:05.625 --> 01:31:08.167
I first heard that expression as a kid.

01:31:08.667 --> 01:31:10.750
Ever since, I wanted it to be true.

01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:17.375
I'm not sure
Marc's the right guy for that.

01:31:20.292 --> 01:31:21.250
I know.

01:31:24.209 --> 01:31:25.417
Does it bother you?

01:31:27.125 --> 01:31:27.792
What?

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:29.875
Me being in films.

01:31:30.334 --> 01:31:32.500
Not a bit. I'm producing them.

01:31:35.250 --> 01:31:37.250
Sure, but it's not the same now.

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:42.625
You're sure you don't mind
me doing scenes?

01:31:43.417 --> 01:31:46.000
You say no, but it feels like it does.

01:31:46.167 --> 01:31:47.417
Of course it doesn't.

01:31:50.375 --> 01:31:51.500
You'd tell me, right?

01:31:53.375 --> 01:31:54.584
Definitely not.

01:31:56.375 --> 01:31:57.334
Thank you.

01:32:09.209 --> 01:32:10.000
How are you?

01:32:10.167 --> 01:32:11.375
Good morning.

01:32:11.542 --> 01:32:12.792
A fine surprise.

01:32:12.959 --> 01:32:16.667
As you said it was educational,
we brought Alexandre.

01:32:16.834 --> 01:32:17.792
Excellent idea.

01:32:17.959 --> 01:32:20.000
- Morning, Alexandre.
- Good morning, sir.

01:32:20.167 --> 01:32:21.167
Cutie pie.

01:32:21.959 --> 01:32:24.375
What a privilege,
opportunity and honor

01:32:24.542 --> 01:32:26.167
to shoot in your magnificent home.

01:32:26.334 --> 01:32:27.750
I hope you show it off.

01:32:27.917 --> 01:32:28.792
Absolutely.

01:32:28.959 --> 01:32:31.917
We want luxury rating
but they don't give it to everyone.

01:32:32.084 --> 01:32:33.000
I imagine so.

01:32:33.334 --> 01:32:36.917
At least your shoot
will pay to fix the roof.

01:32:37.084 --> 01:32:39.000
- And the hen run.
- Marvelous.

01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:42.042
This is Henri Pachard, our director.

01:32:42.209 --> 01:32:44.084
Started out with Jean-Luc Godard.

01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:46.625
Wonderful. I love westerns.

01:32:48.959 --> 01:32:50.125
Add it to our application.

01:32:51.417 --> 01:32:53.084
Henri, so I come in the room,

01:32:53.250 --> 01:32:55.667
hey girls, whatever.
And I walk to here.

01:32:55.834 --> 01:32:57.084
That's my chair?

01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:59.875
Super-duper.

01:33:00.042 --> 01:33:01.834
What's the film educating about?

01:33:03.167 --> 01:33:04.250
Reproduction.

01:33:06.209 --> 01:33:07.417
Did you know, in Zaire,

01:33:07.584 --> 01:33:10.584
the Nabawi penetrate the earth
with their penises?

01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:12.584
To thank the god of fertility.

01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:13.917
No, I didn't know that.

01:33:14.084 --> 01:33:15.042
Me neither.

01:33:15.417 --> 01:33:17.584
See? These films teach you stuff.

01:33:17.834 --> 01:33:20.167
They're a kind of encyclopedia

01:33:20.334 --> 01:33:21.542
of reproduction worldwide.

01:33:22.792 --> 01:33:25.542
Today is your lucky day. It's France!

01:33:25.709 --> 01:33:26.584
Where's my fluffer?

01:33:27.084 --> 01:33:30.334
Quit twiddling your thumbs
and lock those lips on my dick,

01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:31.959
so I'm ready for the take.

01:33:32.125 --> 01:33:33.375
It's fascinating.

01:33:33.625 --> 01:33:34.709
Yes.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.834
You're gonna be a huge star.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
You need someone to guide you, baby.

01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:46.542
- And that's you?
- Yes.

01:33:47.125 --> 01:33:48.084
That's me.

01:33:48.875 --> 01:33:50.084
I know the pitfalls.

01:33:50.875 --> 01:33:52.917
And the traps. Believe me.

01:33:53.084 --> 01:33:54.209
There's lots of them.

01:33:56.125 --> 01:33:58.042
Together, we can go places.

01:33:59.709 --> 01:34:01.292
People will recognize us.

01:34:01.834 --> 01:34:04.542
They'll know our names.
On the street, everywhere.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.042
A problem, baby?

01:34:12.625 --> 01:34:13.709
You're quiet.

01:34:21.292 --> 01:34:22.125
Ok?

01:34:22.459 --> 01:34:23.292
Yes.

01:34:23.792 --> 01:34:24.750
Nervous?

01:34:26.209 --> 01:34:27.625
Think of something else.

01:34:28.625 --> 01:34:29.625
Like what?

01:34:30.209 --> 01:34:31.292
Anything you want.

01:34:31.459 --> 01:34:34.125
Caprice, sweetheart, we need you on set.

01:34:35.209 --> 01:34:36.542
Can I think of you?

01:34:37.042 --> 01:34:38.209
If you want.

01:34:46.625 --> 01:34:48.042
But the Count

01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:50.125
is anything but a gentleman.

01:34:50.292 --> 01:34:51.417
You called Maurice?

01:34:51.584 --> 01:34:52.417
Yeah.

01:34:53.125 --> 01:34:55.542
He hedged. I'm scared he won't pay up.

01:34:55.959 --> 01:34:57.792
- How come?
- I don't know.

01:34:57.959 --> 01:35:00.709
It's dragging on. He's wary, keeps away.

01:35:00.875 --> 01:35:01.917
What do we tell Bazin?

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.292
He's hot but you make him sizzle.

01:35:07.959 --> 01:35:09.625
You can't resist and...

01:35:10.792 --> 01:35:11.959
You go for the flies

01:35:12.459 --> 01:35:13.500
and the drumstick.

01:35:13.667 --> 01:35:15.834
If we're ready, let's get it in the can.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.750
Real silence, for once!

01:35:22.584 --> 01:35:23.167
Camera.

01:35:26.834 --> 01:35:28.917
Scene 36/1, take 1.

01:35:31.042 --> 01:35:31.750
Action!

01:35:33.209 --> 01:35:34.500
You girls are lookers.

01:35:36.417 --> 01:35:38.000
You're not bad yourself.

01:35:38.167 --> 01:35:40.000
You must be hung like a horse.

01:35:40.334 --> 01:35:42.334
Yeah, I'm an animal lover.

01:35:43.584 --> 01:35:45.334
Let's arrest them for shit dialogue.

01:35:45.667 --> 01:35:46.625
For later, sure.

01:35:48.917 --> 01:35:50.042
Very well.

01:36:01.709 --> 01:36:02.917
She's so fucking hot.

01:36:03.084 --> 01:36:04.250
Holy fucking shit!

01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:06.834
I can't watch, she gives me a migraine.

01:36:20.875 --> 01:36:23.292
Caprice,
turn slightly toward the camera.

01:36:24.959 --> 01:36:26.792
You're too tense. Relax.

01:36:27.459 --> 01:36:28.500
It'll come.

01:36:48.334 --> 01:36:49.834
The kid just stays there?

01:36:51.792 --> 01:36:54.209
Caprice, a bit more toward the camera.

01:36:55.875 --> 01:36:57.750
Damn, I'm all the way in.

01:37:02.792 --> 01:37:03.750
Feels good, right?

01:37:04.125 --> 01:37:04.917
You feel it?

01:37:05.250 --> 01:37:06.959
I love your tight pussy.

01:37:07.709 --> 01:37:08.875
I'm balls deep.

01:37:09.042 --> 01:37:10.334
You feel it, don't you?

01:37:11.459 --> 01:37:12.709
You're turning me on.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.667
Tell her to stop, it tickles.

01:37:16.167 --> 01:37:17.375
Toots, change hands.

01:37:17.542 --> 01:37:19.125
It's casting shadows, too.

01:37:19.292 --> 01:37:20.292
It's so good.

01:37:21.250 --> 01:37:22.334
You feel it?

01:37:22.959 --> 01:37:24.209
I love your pussy.

01:37:25.709 --> 01:37:26.875
I want you so bad.

01:37:28.334 --> 01:37:29.584
You love it.

01:37:31.792 --> 01:37:32.792
I'm gonna come.

01:37:34.042 --> 01:37:36.167
No discharging. The cumshot's next up.

01:37:36.334 --> 01:37:37.042
On Lola.

01:37:37.625 --> 01:37:39.000
- Cut.
- We've cut.

01:37:39.167 --> 01:37:40.709
Come on, let's go.

01:37:40.875 --> 01:37:43.542
- I only have 100 feet.
- Don't give a shit.

01:37:43.959 --> 01:37:44.917
There!

01:37:46.667 --> 01:37:47.834
Do it, do it!

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.417
I'll say when I'm ready.

01:37:49.584 --> 01:37:51.417
Do it. We'll go end sticks.

01:37:51.584 --> 01:37:52.417
Roll it.

01:37:52.584 --> 01:37:53.334
Speed.

01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:54.500
We're rolling.

01:37:55.709 --> 01:37:56.584
Fast!

01:37:58.209 --> 01:37:59.209
Coming!

01:38:13.625 --> 01:38:14.750
End sticks.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.500
36/6, take 1. Tail slate.

01:38:18.667 --> 01:38:19.584
We got it?

01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:21.292
- It went so fast.
- We got it.

01:38:21.459 --> 01:38:23.209
- Sure?
- We got it.

01:38:33.084 --> 01:38:35.375
Magnificent. John Baccardi!

01:38:36.875 --> 01:38:38.875
It's not our last shoot together.

01:38:40.292 --> 01:38:41.542
In your room, not on set.

01:38:41.834 --> 01:38:43.292
Grab your stuff and go.

01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:45.709
Got that? You're fired, beat it.

01:39:01.167 --> 01:39:02.959
I was born by C-section.

01:39:03.125 --> 01:39:05.000
Alexandre was a C-section, too.

01:39:05.167 --> 01:39:06.625
- No way?
- Sure.

01:39:07.209 --> 01:39:09.084
It's wonderful, so much better.

01:39:09.542 --> 01:39:12.125
Olive oil on my beans, please.
Not butter.

01:39:12.292 --> 01:39:13.542
Butter's great.

01:39:14.250 --> 01:39:16.917
I'm no magician. We'll run out today.

01:39:17.084 --> 01:39:18.792
When will the stock get here?

01:39:19.209 --> 01:39:20.209
We'll go see Maurice.

01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:23.375
As soon as we get the cash,
I'll call the lab.

01:39:23.792 --> 01:39:25.167
What about the offcuts?

01:39:25.709 --> 01:39:28.750
We'll save them for tomorrow.
Afterward...

01:39:28.917 --> 01:39:30.000
Finito.

01:39:31.125 --> 01:39:33.459
- Eat some greens.
- Don't laugh it off.

01:39:33.625 --> 01:39:34.834
You're not interested?

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.125
Sure I am.

01:39:36.292 --> 01:39:37.500
But like I said...

01:39:37.917 --> 01:39:38.875
I have nothing.

01:39:39.875 --> 01:39:41.834
You just laugh. You don't care.

01:39:42.459 --> 01:39:43.875
I do care, it's just...

01:39:44.042 --> 01:39:47.125
- I'm in shit and you goof off.
- We'll get the cash.

01:39:47.292 --> 01:39:48.167
It's not funny.

01:39:48.334 --> 01:39:49.917
Keep your hair on, Henri.

01:39:50.084 --> 01:39:52.625
I'm on edge. I'm making a film here,

01:39:52.792 --> 01:39:54.500
not tossing green beans. See you.

01:39:59.875 --> 01:40:01.542
It's The Monkees.

01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:04.209
Wasted trip, honeybuns.

01:40:04.417 --> 01:40:06.000
We don't keep the money here.

01:40:06.167 --> 01:40:08.292
Trouble is, we started shooting.

01:40:08.459 --> 01:40:09.959
That's great.

01:40:10.125 --> 01:40:13.375
When we paid up front,
the crew took my money and ran.

01:40:13.792 --> 01:40:15.459
This isn't going to work.

01:40:15.625 --> 01:40:16.709
We'll stop the shoot.

01:40:16.875 --> 01:40:18.250
Tell me who fucks the best.

01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:21.417
I'll come by later in the week.

01:40:22.084 --> 01:40:22.792
With money?

01:40:23.125 --> 01:40:25.417
Don't worry, you'll get the money.

01:40:25.584 --> 01:40:26.792
When will we get it?

01:40:26.959 --> 01:40:27.834
Tomorrow.

01:40:28.334 --> 01:40:30.834
Come by my place in the afternoon.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.500
The girls would like that.

01:40:33.625 --> 01:40:35.625
We'd prefer you to write us a check.

01:40:36.459 --> 01:40:37.417
A check?

01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:40.209
Can you believe them?

01:40:40.959 --> 01:40:43.459
Everyone's paid in cash
on our productions.

01:40:43.625 --> 01:40:46.417
Porno invented the concept of tax fraud.

01:40:47.375 --> 01:40:50.125
- Our film's gotta ring folks' bells.
- No sweat.

01:40:50.292 --> 01:40:51.709
Guys and girls'll love it.

01:40:52.792 --> 01:40:54.375
Yeah, and not just them.

01:40:58.750 --> 01:41:00.209
Nice one, guys!

01:41:01.417 --> 01:41:02.500
Great job.

01:41:02.667 --> 01:41:04.292
We'll nail them now, boys.

01:41:04.959 --> 01:41:06.000
Good work.

01:41:06.167 --> 01:41:07.334
We'll collar them!

01:41:15.292 --> 01:41:17.292
You won't be there for the arrests,

01:41:17.459 --> 01:41:19.709
so we don't blow your cover.

01:41:19.875 --> 01:41:22.375
Fine, so how are you going to work it?

01:41:22.792 --> 01:41:24.334
Maurice at home with the cash.

01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:27.042
Then we round up the others,
the film crew.

01:41:29.084 --> 01:41:32.459
Imagine Vogel's face
when we rock up instead of you.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.459
How come, the film crew?

01:41:35.875 --> 01:41:37.167
We take them in, too.

01:41:38.125 --> 01:41:39.584
Seriously? What for?

01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:42.750
Vogel pays them in cash.
We'll make examples of them.

01:41:43.542 --> 01:41:44.709
That wasn't the plan.

01:41:44.875 --> 01:41:47.167
They're small fry. It's just mean.

01:41:47.334 --> 01:41:49.209
You're nobody's favorite people.

01:41:49.417 --> 01:41:51.125
Spare me your scruples.

01:41:51.792 --> 01:41:53.209
Vincent joins the crew,

01:41:53.375 --> 01:41:54.792
so we have a guy there.

01:41:54.959 --> 01:41:56.292
Vincent?

01:41:56.459 --> 01:41:57.375
Him?

01:42:00.292 --> 01:42:01.542
It's just stupid.

01:42:02.167 --> 01:42:04.500
What can he do? Sound? Camera?

01:42:04.667 --> 01:42:07.667
In a tiny crew, they'll rumble him.
It won't fly.

01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:11.042
Hire him as an actor
to justify his presence.

01:42:11.209 --> 01:42:12.750
- Me acting?
- Easy, tiger.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.500
We nab Maurice and the gang

01:42:14.667 --> 01:42:15.625
before you get on.

01:42:15.792 --> 01:42:16.875
It's a lame idea.

01:42:17.042 --> 01:42:19.292
Just find a way to get him in tonight.

01:42:20.334 --> 01:42:21.959
The operation's tomorrow.

01:42:33.459 --> 01:42:35.334
You'd trust a butthole like him?

01:42:36.375 --> 01:42:37.500
Not a chance.

01:42:37.959 --> 01:42:39.125
I'm very offended.

01:42:39.292 --> 01:42:41.542
I'm ready and willing.

01:42:55.167 --> 01:42:57.834
Like my hair?
I got the idea from a film.

01:43:01.542 --> 01:43:03.125
What's with the outfit?

01:43:04.084 --> 01:43:05.334
Camouflage.

01:43:05.834 --> 01:43:08.209
Camouflage for what? Fag warfare?

01:43:09.792 --> 01:43:10.834
I don't know.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Let's go.

01:43:21.084 --> 01:43:23.334
Where the hell have you guys been?

01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:26.000
Finding a replacement for Marc.

01:43:26.167 --> 01:43:27.292
This is Vincent.

01:43:27.459 --> 01:43:28.709
Hi there, Vincent!

01:43:33.292 --> 01:43:34.584
Henri Pachard, big boss.

01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:35.667
Vincent.

01:43:36.417 --> 01:43:37.750
Pachard, low-paid and patient.

01:43:37.917 --> 01:43:38.750
Welcome.

01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:40.875
Drag up a chair.

01:43:46.917 --> 01:43:48.584
Henri was pitching us ideas.

01:43:48.750 --> 01:43:49.917
So...

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.959
Yes, I was saying that...

01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.959
I think I've reached a level

01:43:56.125 --> 01:43:59.625
as a director,
technically and artistically,

01:43:59.792 --> 01:44:02.917
that allows me to cross over
into mainstream cinema.

01:44:03.792 --> 01:44:05.667
How about we do it together?

01:44:06.875 --> 01:44:09.084
I have millions of ideas that will make

01:44:09.250 --> 01:44:10.875
a fortune every time.

01:44:12.459 --> 01:44:14.292
Just one example...

01:44:15.125 --> 01:44:16.584
Citizen Kane 2.

01:44:18.750 --> 01:44:19.625
Imagine

01:44:20.667 --> 01:44:22.542
kids enter the property

01:44:22.709 --> 01:44:24.500
with the big gate there.

01:44:25.417 --> 01:44:26.459
Citizen Kane.

01:44:26.625 --> 01:44:28.250
They go through the gate.

01:44:28.834 --> 01:44:31.250
They take the sled by the fire...

01:44:32.167 --> 01:44:33.250
Rosebud.

01:44:34.750 --> 01:44:36.750
They remove the sled from the flames.

01:44:36.917 --> 01:44:38.375
And the sled's magic.

01:44:42.250 --> 01:44:44.542
They go outside with the sled

01:44:45.584 --> 01:44:46.459
and then...

01:44:46.792 --> 01:44:47.959
Our story begins.

01:44:48.125 --> 01:44:49.417
How was your day?

01:44:49.667 --> 01:44:51.667
Yeah, great. My scenes were cool,

01:44:51.834 --> 01:44:53.250
with Sheila and Melissa.

01:44:53.417 --> 01:44:55.417
I think Henri was happy. Right?

01:44:57.417 --> 01:44:58.084
And you?

01:44:58.792 --> 01:45:00.334
- Good day?
- Fine.

01:45:00.917 --> 01:45:01.917
Fine.

01:45:04.042 --> 01:45:05.667
You got my stock?

01:45:07.917 --> 01:45:09.875
- You got film?
- We will tomorrow.

01:45:10.084 --> 01:45:10.709
Sure?

01:45:12.834 --> 01:45:13.917
We're in business.

01:45:14.084 --> 01:45:15.792
Mr. Smiley says,

01:45:15.959 --> 01:45:18.084
smile and the world smiles with you.

01:45:19.125 --> 01:45:20.334
Smile a bit.

01:45:20.959 --> 01:45:22.000
John!

01:45:23.042 --> 01:45:24.375
Cazzo duro!

01:45:24.542 --> 01:45:25.750
No kidding.

01:45:25.917 --> 01:45:27.000
Monkey Cock?

01:45:28.209 --> 01:45:29.542
We're back in business.

01:45:48.125 --> 01:45:49.959
Momo, when you buy groceries,

01:45:50.125 --> 01:45:52.625
can you get
makeup remover and cotton buds?

01:45:56.042 --> 01:45:57.584
Girls, let's concentrate.

01:45:58.542 --> 01:46:00.834
Feel yourselves taking off.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.250
We're levitating, we're rising.

01:46:03.417 --> 01:46:06.084
We have no more bodies, no more arms.

01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:09.292
Feel your soul in your feet.

01:46:22.292 --> 01:46:23.584
Where are Serge and Franck?

01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:25.417
Nobody's seen them all day.

01:46:25.584 --> 01:46:27.417
Where the hell are they?

01:46:27.584 --> 01:46:30.417
What do we do? Work on our characters?

01:46:33.167 --> 01:46:35.500
Fredo, how much film you got?

01:46:36.584 --> 01:46:37.834
Four minutes.

01:46:42.042 --> 01:46:43.667
Let's do it. Positions.

01:46:45.417 --> 01:46:48.000
Lean kinda languidly on the hood

01:46:48.167 --> 01:46:49.667
of the Bentley. Perfect.

01:46:49.834 --> 01:46:51.917
- We're shooting.
- You bet.

01:46:52.084 --> 01:46:54.709
Pumpkin, lose the cigarette.

01:46:56.125 --> 01:46:59.084
You go straight for the pants
and start bobbing.

01:46:59.875 --> 01:47:02.459
Forget the tie. Straight for the pants.

01:47:03.792 --> 01:47:05.334
I'm not in great shape.

01:47:06.084 --> 01:47:07.167
Sorry.

01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:09.000
Tomorrow maybe.

01:47:11.417 --> 01:47:12.417
Tomorrow?

01:47:14.084 --> 01:47:14.959
No shit?

01:47:15.125 --> 01:47:17.834
I have a crew, a Bentley, a star!

01:47:18.334 --> 01:47:21.459
Four minutes of film
and you're like "maybe tomorrow"?

01:47:21.625 --> 01:47:22.625
Straight up,

01:47:22.792 --> 01:47:24.959
I want my scene right here, right now.

01:47:25.125 --> 01:47:26.334
Tomorrow, come on.

01:47:27.459 --> 01:47:29.750
Come back to earth.
Want a slug of Ricard?

01:47:29.917 --> 01:47:31.417
- To relax you?
- Yeah.

01:47:31.584 --> 01:47:32.750
Drink up.

01:47:34.375 --> 01:47:36.959
Would you prefer something a bit...

01:47:37.709 --> 01:47:40.417
violent, you know, or more...

01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:42.875
languorous.

01:47:43.709 --> 01:47:45.125
A mix. We'll mix it up.

01:47:45.292 --> 01:47:46.209
A mix?

01:47:46.667 --> 01:47:48.667
You heard that? Mix it up.

01:47:52.417 --> 01:47:54.417
How long for you to get into gear?

01:47:56.584 --> 01:47:58.709
Look, you give it a tug-a-lug.

01:48:00.167 --> 01:48:02.209
And when you're fit and firing,

01:48:02.834 --> 01:48:04.292
give us a shout.

01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:49.292
We're good.

01:48:51.792 --> 01:48:52.959
Blow him.

01:48:57.625 --> 01:49:01.334
We're reborn as animal or vegetable.

01:49:06.875 --> 01:49:08.334
Maurice Vogel?

01:49:12.959 --> 01:49:15.417
A name is only what a guy makes of it.

01:49:15.584 --> 01:49:16.750
Him. Nobody else.

01:49:17.125 --> 01:49:18.125
What's he say?

01:49:18.292 --> 01:49:20.500
You mind if I take a look in the bag?

01:49:31.209 --> 01:49:32.542
You need a new outfit?

01:49:33.209 --> 01:49:34.375
Where's the cash?

01:49:34.542 --> 01:49:35.792
What cash?

01:49:37.125 --> 01:49:38.875
Turn the place upside down.

01:49:39.042 --> 01:49:40.125
Find the dough!

01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:42.834
I'm flying.

01:50:20.292 --> 01:50:21.667
Where the hell are they?

01:50:25.584 --> 01:50:26.375
You go left.

01:51:07.542 --> 01:51:09.334
So we're screwed?

01:51:10.417 --> 01:51:11.667
Most likely.

01:51:12.959 --> 01:51:14.292
What do we risk?

01:51:14.667 --> 01:51:15.584
Dunno.

01:51:16.959 --> 01:51:19.375
The top brass won't want any publicity.

01:51:21.125 --> 01:51:23.250
Anyway, what does it matter?

01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:30.792
We put sunshine in their heads.
Don't let it stop now.

01:51:33.167 --> 01:51:34.834
I'm glad we did it.

01:51:38.125 --> 01:51:39.167
I'm glad.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.084
Henri!

01:51:49.625 --> 01:51:51.750
- You ever made a film in Italy?
- No.

01:51:53.125 --> 01:51:54.834
Maybe the next one.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.042
Alright.

01:52:00.209 --> 01:52:01.334
Count me in.

01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:02.959
Showtime, ladies.

01:52:03.125 --> 01:52:04.417
Henri, we're ready.

01:52:08.375 --> 01:52:09.417
So...

01:52:10.167 --> 01:52:12.625
Let's finish the damn film!

01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:15.750
Ready, kids?

01:52:16.667 --> 01:52:18.250
So, roll camera.

01:52:18.417 --> 01:52:19.500
Speed.

01:52:19.917 --> 01:52:22.000
Scene 51/1, take 1.

01:52:25.125 --> 01:52:26.167
Action, girls!

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:35.875
What's that?

01:52:37.375 --> 01:52:38.584
I don't know.

01:52:39.250 --> 01:52:40.542
Nature's far out.

01:52:40.709 --> 01:52:41.667
Cut!

01:52:42.584 --> 01:52:44.750
Come here, kids. Bring the camera.

01:52:46.917 --> 01:52:48.792
Grab it, come on.

01:53:20.125 --> 01:53:21.375
Film it, let's roll.

01:53:21.542 --> 01:53:22.209
Rolling!

01:58:56.667 --> 01:58:59.209
