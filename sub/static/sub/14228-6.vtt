WEBVTT

00:07.042 --> 00:08.308
Previously on Roadies...

00:08.343 --> 00:11.011
So, here we go. Hometown number one.

00:11.046 --> 00:12.145
Denver, Colorado.

00:12.181 --> 00:13.914
Yeah!

00:13.949 --> 00:17.250
I have a bad feeling about you
bringing Mike Finger here.

00:17.286 --> 00:19.753
Finger holds the key to our box set.

00:19.788 --> 00:21.154
Reg Whitehead?

00:21.190 --> 00:22.789
Dude, I'm your manny.

00:22.825 --> 00:24.458
You're fired, hipster asshole.

00:24.493 --> 00:26.126
People actually think I'm with Reg?

00:26.161 --> 00:28.328
We all know. Why hide it?

00:28.363 --> 00:30.363
He likes you, and he's actually here,

00:30.399 --> 00:32.131
which in my world is a fucking plus.

00:32.167 --> 00:35.102
I'm wondering if we should
keep playing Janine.

00:35.137 --> 00:37.537
- Why?
- Because she called.

00:37.573 --> 00:39.606
- Janine called?
- The actual Janine?

00:39.641 --> 00:42.175
- I will find this Janine.
- Janine Beckwith.

00:42.211 --> 00:44.111
Legend has it Christopher stumbled on

00:44.146 --> 00:46.646
someone's old yearbook
in a Salvation Army

00:46.682 --> 00:48.515
with all these inscriptions in it.

00:48.550 --> 00:50.617
- I don't need to see her.
- Would you like to come back

00:50.652 --> 00:51.618
tomorrow night?

00:51.653 --> 00:52.986
Is this you asking

00:53.021 --> 00:55.655
or is this you asking for Christopher?

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:08.036 --> 01:10.036
Looking for the Staton-House Band.

01:14.676 --> 01:18.145
Looking for the Staton-House Band.

01:19.548 --> 01:21.314
Staton-House Band?

01:21.350 --> 01:26.019
Yeah, uh, they're
actually not staying at this hotel.

01:27.422 --> 01:28.922
Well, who are you?

01:28.957 --> 01:32.726
I'm the tour manager.

01:32.761 --> 01:34.861
May I?

01:37.132 --> 01:40.600
I can't.

01:40.636 --> 01:42.102
Have a good one.

01:42.137 --> 01:43.503
You, too.

01:57.986 --> 02:00.253
Shit.

02:00.289 --> 02:01.888
Oh, wait, I got one.

02:01.924 --> 02:05.725
"You can wait here
or you can come with."

02:05.761 --> 02:07.260
I don't actually mind that one.

02:07.296 --> 02:08.455
Here's the one I can't stand.

02:08.463 --> 02:10.096
"It is what it is."

02:10.132 --> 02:11.765
Oh, agreed. That is one of
my least favorite phrases.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.300
Where is it?

02:13.335 --> 02:15.135
What does "it is what it is" even mean?

02:15.170 --> 02:16.303
- Shh.
- Gently.

02:16.338 --> 02:18.104
Sorry. Forgot you got all

02:18.140 --> 02:20.273
liquored and tindered up last night.

02:20.309 --> 02:23.109
You should have come with.

02:23.145 --> 02:25.312
"It is what it is" means, "Fuck it.

02:25.347 --> 02:28.215
You're on your own.
You're fucked," much as I am.

02:28.250 --> 02:30.250
Nothing good ever happens
after someone says,

02:30.285 --> 02:31.718
"It is what it is."

02:31.753 --> 02:33.787
Christ on a bike.

02:33.822 --> 02:35.121
That's a bad one, too.

02:35.157 --> 02:36.790
No, I me... I mean, Christ on a bike.

02:36.825 --> 02:38.391
I can't find my laminate.

02:44.533 --> 02:46.466
Beautiful day, huh, Reg?

02:46.501 --> 02:48.602
It is, indeed. If
you like deliriously high

02:48.637 --> 02:50.003
bass players texting the Governor's wife

02:50.038 --> 02:51.571
in the middle of the night.

02:51.607 --> 02:53.807
Are you kidding? I
thought Rick loved Natalie Shayne.

02:53.842 --> 02:57.110
And it seems, the wife of
Governor Steve Beagle, "Tiff."

02:57.145 --> 03:00.013
I also heard Rick found
a sober companion.

03:00.048 --> 03:02.148
Yeah, I'm not sure I trust
any sober companion

03:02.184 --> 03:04.618
hired by someone who is drunk
at the time of hiring.

03:04.653 --> 03:07.020
I'm hoping this is rock bottom for Rick.

03:07.055 --> 03:09.356
Lucius almost filed harassment charges.

03:09.391 --> 03:12.158
Things can only get better.
Nice shirt, by the way.

03:12.194 --> 03:14.628
Isn't it just?

03:18.634 --> 03:20.433
Kelly Ann's going to tell
you she lost her laminate.

03:20.469 --> 03:24.037
Mm, 500 bucks or
you wear the turkey hat.

03:24.072 --> 03:26.172
Oh, yeah, so... so what
is the actual theory

03:26.208 --> 03:28.942
behind the wearing of the turkey hat?

03:28.977 --> 03:30.343
Well, it's about everyone knowing

03:30.379 --> 03:31.678
you've let yourself down.

03:31.713 --> 03:34.381
You gotta wear the shame.

03:34.416 --> 03:35.715
Well, no way I lost it.

03:35.751 --> 03:37.350
I just temporarily can't find it.

03:37.386 --> 03:39.319
That's what happens right
before you lose something,

03:39.354 --> 03:40.687
possibly forever.

03:40.722 --> 03:42.889
Well, what if we just, you know,

03:42.924 --> 03:45.058
bend the rules this one time?

03:45.093 --> 03:46.660
Like, a one-time only thing.

03:46.695 --> 03:49.029
And she can give herself
a break, for once.

03:49.064 --> 03:50.730
Rules are rules though, right?

03:50.766 --> 03:54.701
And you gotta face the repercussions.

03:55.737 --> 03:57.737
Wait!

03:57.773 --> 04:00.774
I know where I must have left it.

04:03.545 --> 04:04.711
Hey, guys.

04:04.746 --> 04:07.881
- Oh, Shel?
- Uh-huh.

04:07.916 --> 04:11.318
Um, so you know I
still got this, uh, Shelli?

04:11.353 --> 04:12.819
- Y... yes?
- You know I still got this, um,

04:12.854 --> 04:14.754
lost luggage problem with
a, uh, brown leather Fendi.

04:14.790 --> 04:17.057
- Mm, yes.
- So if you could slip this

04:17.091 --> 04:20.192
into the laundry with wardrobe,
and I... I'll gladly pay.

04:20.228 --> 04:23.396
Um, it's just that the...
the... the hotels, they charge so much.

04:23.432 --> 04:24.931
I know, don't they? No, you...
you don't have to pay.

04:24.966 --> 04:27.767
- Don't worry.
- Oh, no. Really?

04:27.803 --> 04:29.569
I insist.

04:43.151 --> 04:44.684
Oh, hello, great Janine.

05:50.685 --> 05:55.522
By the power vested in me,
as judge, jury, and executioner

05:55.557 --> 05:59.759
for 2016 Capture the Flag
tour, you must now be made to suffer

05:59.795 --> 06:02.796
the hat of eternal shame.

06:09.738 --> 06:11.004
It is what it is.

06:14.976 --> 06:18.278
Yeah, I got 20 on the turkey.

06:27.989 --> 06:29.829
Sorry, I'm feeling
tidal waves of embarrassment

06:29.858 --> 06:32.992
just being near you.

06:33.028 --> 06:34.627
- Ha.
- Okay, guys.

06:34.663 --> 06:35.663
Morning circle, let's go.

06:35.664 --> 06:36.835
- Bill?
- Yeah?

06:36.836 --> 06:38.998
Some of us had an extremely
heavy night last night,

06:39.034 --> 06:43.203
so maybe we could do, like,
a semicircle this morning

06:43.238 --> 06:46.306
where we just sit right here
and you can tell us a story.

06:46.341 --> 06:48.074
Yes, pretend like
we're your congregation

06:48.109 --> 06:50.977
and preach to us, brother.

06:51.012 --> 06:54.314
All right, um...

06:54.349 --> 06:58.051
well, I'd like to officially
welcome our band archivist,

06:58.086 --> 07:00.520
who's been with us a couple
days already, but...

07:00.555 --> 07:02.689
I don't know that anybody's

07:02.724 --> 07:05.191
been welcomed to
our family circle faster

07:05.227 --> 07:06.427
than this gentleman right here.

07:06.461 --> 07:08.394
This is not the tale of some millennial

07:08.430 --> 07:11.664
who collected a couple of
clippings and created a website.

07:11.700 --> 07:13.666
This is a rich legacy.

07:13.702 --> 07:15.768
Let me tell you the story
of another young man.

07:15.804 --> 07:17.904
A young man from Brooklyn, New York,

07:17.939 --> 07:19.572
the son of a dressmaker.

07:19.608 --> 07:22.375
He started in the mailroom
at William Morris,

07:22.410 --> 07:24.244
later began Asylum Records,

07:24.279 --> 07:26.279
sold it and started Geffen Records.

07:26.314 --> 07:29.716
That's right, I'm talking
about billionaire David Geffen.

07:29.751 --> 07:31.451
Did I mention Danny Sugarman?

07:31.486 --> 07:34.854
'Cause that 16-year-old kid,
he was answering fan mail

07:34.890 --> 07:38.925
at 8512 Santa Monica Boulevard,
headquarters of...

07:38.960 --> 07:40.960
- The Doors.
- The Doors, huh.

07:40.996 --> 07:43.897
And he became the
right hand man and Boswell

07:43.932 --> 07:45.465
Jim Morrison.

07:45.500 --> 07:48.801
You see, guys... guys?

07:48.837 --> 07:51.638
The Civil War had Ken Burns,

07:51.673 --> 07:54.374
Lyndon Johnson had Robert Caro,

07:54.409 --> 07:56.476
and the
Staten-House Band is lucky enough

07:56.511 --> 08:00.146
to have Mr. Michael Lewis Finger.

08:00.181 --> 08:02.749
Remember that name, okay?

08:02.784 --> 08:04.784
Yeah, thank you.

08:04.819 --> 08:09.088
So, one more hometown show,
and, uh, don't be surprised.

08:09.124 --> 08:11.791
Everybody acts a little
nuts due to the altitude.

08:11.826 --> 08:16.095
You see, high atop mountains,
people behave differently.

08:16.131 --> 08:18.665
They hear differently.

08:18.700 --> 08:21.000
They make mistakes.

08:21.036 --> 08:24.737
Make choices that can sometime
alter the course of their lives.

08:24.773 --> 08:28.274
The thing about life is
you only got one shot

08:28.310 --> 08:31.177
to get it right, but here in Denver,

08:31.212 --> 08:33.479
we got two, right?

08:33.515 --> 08:36.015
So here we go.
Denver hometown number two.

08:36.051 --> 08:39.251
Let's do it. Let's get it going, right?

08:39.287 --> 08:40.986
Okay, thanks.

08:41.022 --> 08:41.988
- Let's have a good show.
- Sorry, just, uh, just...

08:42.023 --> 08:43.155
just one... just one quick thing.

08:43.191 --> 08:44.624
- Hey, Reg?
- Before you...

08:44.659 --> 08:45.992
- S... sorry.
- Before you go.

08:46.027 --> 08:47.827
I, uh, I had a phone call...

08:47.862 --> 08:51.197
this morning from Jack White's manager.

08:51.232 --> 08:53.700
Jack is a huge fan of the band.

08:53.735 --> 08:55.501
He is in Denver.

08:55.537 --> 08:58.871
And he would like to open
up for us tonight.

08:58.907 --> 08:59.872
What? Seriously?

08:59.908 --> 09:01.007
Great.

09:01.042 --> 09:04.677
Yeah, okay.

09:07.649 --> 09:09.849
Okay.

09:09.884 --> 09:11.951
- You look good.
- Thank you.

09:11.987 --> 09:14.487
You look great.

09:14.522 --> 09:16.823
- Hello.
- Leave me alone.

09:16.858 --> 09:19.559
I'm set up and there is
absolutely nothing I need to do.

09:19.594 --> 09:21.494
If only that were true.

09:21.529 --> 09:23.963
What?

09:23.999 --> 09:26.132
Everybody has to do their
once-a-tour hang with Tom,

09:26.167 --> 09:27.367
and you're up.

09:27.402 --> 09:28.368
He likes to have
that personal connection

09:28.403 --> 09:30.036
with everybody on the crew.

09:30.071 --> 09:31.537
Can't we just say we have
a personal connection

09:31.573 --> 09:32.905
and not do the hang?

09:32.941 --> 09:34.207
You just hang out with him,

09:34.242 --> 09:35.842
listen to the travails of stardom,

09:35.877 --> 09:37.543
and you get on out of there.

09:37.579 --> 09:40.346
I gotta call Laurie tonight.
She's pregnant.

09:40.382 --> 09:42.081
She wants to have a big jealous fight

09:42.117 --> 09:45.251
and if I hang out with Tom,
I won't have the energy.

09:45.286 --> 09:48.488
- You like to fight?
- That's how we love.

09:48.523 --> 09:51.424
Then we hold each other for hours.

09:51.459 --> 09:53.893
And you talk about everything,
don't you?

10:00.702 --> 10:02.568
It wasn't my fault.

10:05.073 --> 10:07.373
Okay, I'm sorry.

10:07.409 --> 10:09.342
Is that what you want me to say?

10:09.377 --> 10:12.245
Nah. I don't do apologies.

10:12.280 --> 10:15.748
Shit happens, shit gets dealt with.

10:15.784 --> 10:17.784
By the way, you're supposed to
be reading Tale of Two Cities.

10:17.819 --> 10:20.787
- I don't have it.
- Go get it.

10:20.822 --> 10:24.090
I left it in New Orleans,
which is also your fault.

10:24.125 --> 10:26.793
You should have reminded me,

10:26.828 --> 10:28.428
but I've read it anyway.

10:28.463 --> 10:31.698
Yeah? What's it about?

10:31.733 --> 10:35.234
It's about, uh, a city.

10:35.270 --> 10:38.638
And then this... this other city.

10:38.673 --> 10:41.207
Yeah, like, uh, uh, two cities.

10:41.242 --> 10:42.642
And... and then they fight.

10:42.677 --> 10:44.711
Okay, dude,

10:44.746 --> 10:46.479
I personally don't care
if you enter this world

10:46.514 --> 10:48.114
as a person of limited intelligence,

10:48.149 --> 10:50.116
but one day you will be an adult, okay?

10:50.151 --> 10:52.819
And you're going to take
your shit out onto the street.

10:52.854 --> 10:55.521
And believe me, the
street will have an opinion.

10:59.694 --> 11:01.728
I took a big crap in your Yeezies.

11:01.763 --> 11:03.329
No worries.

11:03.364 --> 11:06.432
I'll get your dad to buy me a new pair.

11:06.468 --> 11:08.801
You know what? You
can't rattle me, little man.

11:08.837 --> 11:10.937
Because as much of a dick as you are,

11:10.972 --> 11:12.338
I was way worse.

11:12.373 --> 11:14.373
Now give me the ball.

11:16.678 --> 11:20.513
Why don't you quit like all the others?

11:20.548 --> 11:22.849
Because I have outlets.
Okay? I play guitar.

11:22.884 --> 11:24.917
I garden. I blow people's minds

11:24.953 --> 11:26.652
with coffee that freak boy Mike Finger

11:26.688 --> 11:30.123
says is controversial.

11:30.158 --> 11:31.758
I wish I played guitar.

11:31.793 --> 11:33.926
My dad only taught me three chords.

11:33.962 --> 11:36.929
Wa... wait, is... is
that what this is about?

11:36.965 --> 11:39.132
A guitar lesson?

11:39.167 --> 11:40.933
Would you teach me?

11:42.737 --> 11:44.504
I'm gonna do you one better.

11:52.714 --> 11:54.814
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:54.849 --> 11:56.983
You weren't at morning circle.

11:57.018 --> 11:59.318
You're always at morning circle.

12:01.022 --> 12:03.656
I-I didn't have anybody to
look at while I was bombing.

12:05.426 --> 12:07.393
Oh, you missed this, uh...

12:07.428 --> 12:09.796
Apparently Reg has gotten Jack White

12:09.831 --> 12:12.165
to open for us tonight.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.866
That doesn't sound right.

12:13.902 --> 12:15.501
I mean, Jack White only opens
for the Rolling Stones.

12:15.537 --> 12:17.703
He said he talked to his manager.

12:17.739 --> 12:20.006
I don't know. I think
we're gonna get Jack White.

12:20.041 --> 12:21.707
Will you stop being so positive?

12:23.511 --> 12:27.513
Although that would be
an inspired combination.

12:27.549 --> 12:30.016
It would be rare.

12:30.051 --> 12:31.984
I... I'm talking about
the kind of thing that's so rare

12:32.020 --> 12:36.255
that it's... it's
almost like it didn't happen.

12:36.291 --> 12:37.924
I get the feeling we're not talking

12:37.959 --> 12:40.426
about Jack White anymore.

12:40.461 --> 12:42.195
You know I love Jack White.

12:42.230 --> 12:45.031
Oh, hey, Kelly Ann?

12:45.066 --> 12:47.033
Here. Your man has needs.

12:47.068 --> 12:48.534
Get those to the laundry.

12:48.570 --> 12:50.069
You know I have, like,
an actual job, right?

12:50.104 --> 12:53.072
Day two, turkey hat. You got the time.

12:53.107 --> 12:55.107
You look good. You pull it off.

12:55.143 --> 12:57.510
Some people look a
little ridiculous, you know?

12:57.545 --> 12:58.578
You kinda make it look cool.

13:05.453 --> 13:07.420
How did I get stuck doing Reg's laundry?

13:07.455 --> 13:10.756
The same way I got stuck
doing the Tom Staton hang.

13:10.792 --> 13:13.192
What a waste of time.

13:13.228 --> 13:16.062
Look at these socks.

13:16.097 --> 13:18.731
Like little crescent moons.

13:18.766 --> 13:20.399
They're bananas.

13:20.435 --> 13:22.869
Do you think he went in
the store and he was, like,

13:22.904 --> 13:25.605
"I'll take those socks."

13:25.640 --> 13:28.908
Seems more comfortable
in his skin, you know?

13:28.943 --> 13:32.612
Like almost... cool.

13:32.647 --> 13:35.781
Yeah. Since you've been sleeping
with him, he's been glowing.

13:35.817 --> 13:38.251
- Yeah.
- And firing fewer people.

13:38.286 --> 13:39.819
You're welcome.

13:39.854 --> 13:44.457
- What was it like? - Oh,
it was mind-blowing.

13:44.492 --> 13:46.492
We had fish and chips.
He called Prince William

13:46.527 --> 13:48.127
and they spoke about "bits and bobs."

13:48.162 --> 13:50.229
- It was pretty sublime.
- About time you admit it.

13:59.841 --> 14:02.408
Oh, it's fucking all wet.

14:02.443 --> 14:05.845
Jesus.

14:05.880 --> 14:08.915
Hi, we're looking for a Mr. Manuscitz.

14:08.950 --> 14:11.484
He's no longer in the hotel.

14:11.519 --> 14:13.319
Shit, that's right.

14:13.354 --> 14:17.089
Chris must have changed his name
for the second night in Denver.

14:17.125 --> 14:19.625
Perhaps.

14:19.661 --> 14:21.861
He's gotta be under one
of these other names.

14:21.896 --> 14:23.829
D.B. Cooper?

14:23.865 --> 14:25.631
- No.
- Nothing?

14:25.667 --> 14:29.435
Okay, Reginald Dwight?
Detective Harry Callahan?

14:29.470 --> 14:31.671
- Gordon Sumner?
- Hervé Villechaize?

14:31.706 --> 14:33.606
- David Furnish?
- Bruce Jenner?

14:33.641 --> 14:36.542
- Caitlyn Jenner?
- Francis Albert Sinatra?

14:39.414 --> 14:41.113
For the elevator.

14:41.149 --> 14:43.549
He's gonna make one stray
comment about the show,

14:43.584 --> 14:45.504
then he's gonna immediately
ask you about Janine.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.653
You be brief. Provide no details.

14:47.689 --> 14:49.169
See, Reg, the thing is, you're playing

14:49.190 --> 14:52.792
with incredibly coustie chemicals here.

14:52.827 --> 14:54.493
She's an incredible person.

14:54.529 --> 14:55.861
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:55.897 --> 14:58.164
That's the problem. You look good.

14:58.199 --> 15:00.466
Thanks. How was the garage?

15:00.501 --> 15:02.969
Loved wearing the
Gram Parsons jacket again.

15:03.004 --> 15:05.204
Yeah, it's good. I, uh, I actually...

15:05.239 --> 15:08.674
I plugged in an old boom box
that had "play" still pressed.

15:08.710 --> 15:11.410
"Radio Nowhere" comes on,
same place I'd turned it off

15:11.446 --> 15:13.512
seven years earlier, and for a minute...

15:13.548 --> 15:15.548
Hey, so how is Janine?

15:19.053 --> 15:21.220
She was great.

15:21.255 --> 15:23.823
She was fabulous.

15:23.858 --> 15:25.491
The show, though, I thought
was transcendent.

15:25.526 --> 15:27.360
- Great show.
- It was a...

15:27.395 --> 15:29.862
it was the sort of show
that really made me...

15:29.897 --> 15:32.331
- How did she smell?
- Like a kind of rose.

15:32.367 --> 15:35.835
No, like, um, childhood.

15:35.870 --> 15:37.770
And chocolate.

15:37.805 --> 15:39.705
- Childhood and chocolate.
- Yeah.

15:39.741 --> 15:41.674
You know, I-I think the
new set is the perfect set...

15:41.709 --> 15:43.709
How did she respond to the show?

15:43.745 --> 15:46.278
- I mean, were you with her?
- For most of it, yeah.

15:46.314 --> 15:47.913
That's fantastic. Thank you.

15:47.949 --> 15:49.548
No, my pleasure.

15:49.584 --> 15:51.450
- What did she respond to?
- Well, you, of course.

15:51.486 --> 15:53.419
I mean, she hung on every word.

15:53.454 --> 15:57.056
She's quite quiet, but she's very...

15:57.091 --> 16:00.226
she was very still.

16:00.261 --> 16:04.363
She wore a pea coat.

16:04.399 --> 16:05.698
- The pea coat.
- Mm.

16:05.733 --> 16:08.200
Yeah.

16:08.236 --> 16:09.769
Should we invite her to come tonight?

16:09.804 --> 16:11.470
- Definitely not.
- I think she would love that.

16:11.506 --> 16:13.539
This is great. You
should call and invite her.

16:13.574 --> 16:15.441
- I will do that.
- But no backstage.

16:15.476 --> 16:17.410
Only if she asks.

16:17.445 --> 16:20.646
Childhood and chocolate. I love that.

16:20.681 --> 16:25.651
I wasn't gonna see her again
until you said that.

16:25.686 --> 16:29.121
My pleasure.

16:29.157 --> 16:32.458
- Are you gonna hit me?
- I don't hit...

16:32.493 --> 16:36.595
anymore. Janine's not coming.

16:36.631 --> 16:38.931
She got a flat tire. Her kid's sick.

16:38.966 --> 16:40.433
They need her back
at the emergency room.

16:40.468 --> 16:42.068
She doesn't have a kid.

16:42.103 --> 16:43.769
That woman is a Trigger Girl.

16:43.805 --> 16:45.404
They pull the trigger, Reg.

16:45.440 --> 16:48.174
Okay, she will actively
derail Christopher House,

16:48.209 --> 16:50.776
so you can call Preston,
you do whatever you want,

16:50.812 --> 16:52.244
but you're not gonna walk in here

16:52.280 --> 16:54.613
and fuck with my guitar player's head.

16:54.649 --> 16:56.849
Period. You got that?

17:01.022 --> 17:04.790
Sometimes it's just your turn.

17:11.365 --> 17:13.165
Hey, Tom.

17:13.201 --> 17:17.636
I heard Jim James and Lucius
both tried to steal you.

17:17.672 --> 17:19.204
They all try to steal me.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.707
How have you been? I hear
Laurie's pregnant.

17:21.742 --> 17:23.008
Yeah.

17:23.044 --> 17:24.310
I want to hear how you been doing.

17:24.345 --> 17:25.310
How... how are your parents?

17:25.346 --> 17:26.479
They're good.

17:26.513 --> 17:29.615
My dad came out as gay last year.

17:29.650 --> 17:30.950
And your mom?

17:30.985 --> 17:32.818
She's the only straight one left.

17:32.854 --> 17:34.286
It's tough.

17:34.322 --> 17:35.721
With everything happening with society,

17:35.756 --> 17:38.124
it's like that line from "Happenstance."

17:38.159 --> 17:41.994
"Shifting sands, holding hands,

17:42.029 --> 17:45.531
everything is new."

17:45.566 --> 17:47.833
I'm really glad you guys
are playing that song again.

17:47.869 --> 17:50.336
Christopher's waking up.
Y... you know I love him,

17:50.371 --> 17:53.706
but he's been a little asleep.

17:53.741 --> 17:58.010
And me, you know how I struggle
with the success.

17:58.045 --> 18:00.579
Tom, I have all this pressure to
leave our hang early because...

18:00.615 --> 18:02.414
I ordered you a massage.

18:02.450 --> 18:04.416
But I told everyone
leave me the fuck alone.

18:04.452 --> 18:06.418
I'm hanging with Tom.

18:13.895 --> 18:15.494
Hey.

18:17.265 --> 18:18.564
Sorry, I'm confused.

18:18.599 --> 18:20.866
Are you a turkey or are you a human?

18:20.902 --> 18:25.571
Listen, have you ever seen
the movie Local Hero?

18:25.606 --> 18:27.506
No.

18:27.542 --> 18:29.175
Why?

18:29.210 --> 18:30.543
Nothing.

18:30.578 --> 18:33.112
I was just thinking
about how amazing it is.

18:33.147 --> 18:34.580
And that you would like it.

18:34.615 --> 18:37.783
And I was thinking about actually maybe

18:37.818 --> 18:40.786
watching it again some time.

18:40.821 --> 18:44.423
Oh, I... I'll de...
I'll definitely check it out.

18:44.458 --> 18:48.627
Okay. I'm gonna go on one last
mega-search for my laminate.

18:48.663 --> 18:50.863
Well, happy hunting.

18:56.137 --> 18:58.571
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, man.

19:01.242 --> 19:02.975
You know how in bad movies

19:03.010 --> 19:06.879
when two people who
really enjoy each other's company

19:06.914 --> 19:09.615
sleep together and it
changes everything?

19:09.650 --> 19:12.251
Like, suddenly their whole
being is defined by the fact

19:12.286 --> 19:13.652
that they've had sex.

19:13.688 --> 19:16.622
Yes.

19:16.657 --> 19:20.626
Let's not be in that movie.

19:20.661 --> 19:22.494
- Bill?
- Yeah?

19:22.530 --> 19:25.598
William, honey,

19:25.633 --> 19:28.000
it was, uh, you know,

19:28.035 --> 19:31.070
it was... wow last night.

19:31.105 --> 19:33.572
But, uh, many not-so-great things

19:33.608 --> 19:36.875
are just around the corner
if "wow" ever happens again.

19:39.313 --> 19:40.479
I think that was it.

19:40.514 --> 19:42.081
Really?

19:42.116 --> 19:45.417
You're amazing, but I want
to make your life easier,

19:45.453 --> 19:47.019
not harder.

19:47.054 --> 19:48.287
So it won't happen again.

19:48.322 --> 19:49.755
I knew it last night.

19:49.790 --> 19:52.825
You know what I love about you?

19:52.860 --> 19:55.361
I-I feel like everything
we are as friends

19:55.396 --> 19:57.363
is, like, still in, like,
pretty good shape.

19:57.398 --> 20:00.032
- Yeah.
- You just can't tell anyone.

20:00.067 --> 20:01.667
Shelli, I'm discreet.

20:01.702 --> 20:04.203
I operate very well in these
post-coital waters.

20:04.238 --> 20:07.206
Powerful women find
me safe and interesting.

20:07.241 --> 20:09.275
Quit polishing your apple.

20:09.310 --> 20:12.478
It won't happen again
and none of them will know.

20:12.513 --> 20:14.513
You and I, we'll know.

20:14.548 --> 20:17.383
If that's a problem, tell me now.

20:17.418 --> 20:20.953
No, that's not a problem.

20:20.988 --> 20:23.689
It's just...

20:23.724 --> 20:26.025
I don't enjoy finding
the one good thing in my life

20:26.060 --> 20:27.192
and fucking it up.

20:27.228 --> 20:29.228
I depend on a Bill and Shelli

20:29.263 --> 20:32.031
who know exactly where we
stand with each other.

20:32.066 --> 20:34.333
You know, mostly.

20:34.368 --> 20:36.135
I'm still a good thing in your life.

20:36.170 --> 20:37.736
I lessen stress.

20:37.772 --> 20:40.906
Let's be the Bill and Shelli
is alive and well,

20:40.941 --> 20:43.008
admiring each other from afar,

20:43.044 --> 20:45.210
well-loved by young and old alike,

20:45.246 --> 20:47.479
gripped with amnesia over everything

20:47.515 --> 20:50.816
that's happened in Denver... version.

20:50.851 --> 20:52.351
Deal.

20:52.386 --> 20:55.354
But just no one can find
out what happened.

20:55.389 --> 20:57.990
Stop. You're making me
feel like some trollop

20:58.025 --> 20:59.091
that you picked up along the way.

21:00.361 --> 21:02.561
You're picky, and I'm honored.

21:02.596 --> 21:05.898
And it's over, and I understand that.

21:05.933 --> 21:08.567
You're so adult about this whole thing.

21:08.602 --> 21:11.070
Makes me just a little paranoid

21:11.105 --> 21:13.572
that you only wanted to
see what I was like.

21:13.607 --> 21:17.576
Trust me, that's not the case.

21:17.611 --> 21:20.546
Let's maybe not talk
any more about last night.

21:20.581 --> 21:22.448
May I add one more thing?

21:22.483 --> 21:25.217
- I... I'd rather you didn't.
- It happened, we happened.

21:25.252 --> 21:28.120
It was wonderful. It was unforgettable.

21:28.155 --> 21:31.190
And every 37 years,
when we see the Supermoon

21:31.225 --> 21:33.425
we can think about Bill and Shelli.

21:33.461 --> 21:38.130
Actually the Supermoon
happens every 14 months.

21:38.165 --> 21:42.301
We, uh, we got that wrong.

21:42.336 --> 21:46.372
- Not 37 years.
- Mm-mm.

21:56.317 --> 21:58.984
Mellencamp!

21:59.019 --> 22:00.452
I recognize that voice.

22:00.488 --> 22:03.455
Missed you, brother.

22:03.491 --> 22:04.790
How you doing, hot rod?

22:04.825 --> 22:06.558
What are you guys out doing today?

22:06.594 --> 22:09.294
Nothing much. What the
hell you drinking, man?

22:09.330 --> 22:11.730
Gotta stay healthy these days, right?

22:11.766 --> 22:13.932
Yeah. I hear that, sensei.

22:13.968 --> 22:15.801
Oh, look, uh, I bring you a young man

22:15.836 --> 22:17.403
who wants to play guitar.

22:17.438 --> 22:20.506
This is Winston. He's Tom Staton's kid.

22:20.541 --> 22:22.685
Tom Staton's kid. I like your old man.

22:22.686 --> 22:24.243
He's a fucking asshole.

22:24.278 --> 22:26.912
I remember being your age

22:26.947 --> 22:29.815
and hating my dad, too.

22:29.850 --> 22:31.950
So the best thing to do is, uh,

22:31.986 --> 22:35.020
learn how to make
your anger work for you.

22:35.055 --> 22:37.489
This here is, uh, my life's companion.

22:37.525 --> 22:39.491
Nora Guthrie gave me this guitar.

22:39.527 --> 22:40.826
This was Woody Guthrie's guitar.

22:40.861 --> 22:41.827
You know who Woody Guthrie was?

22:41.862 --> 22:43.262
No.

22:43.297 --> 22:46.765
Woody Guthrie's name
is written in the stars.

22:46.801 --> 22:48.867
He wrote the most beautiful songs.

22:48.903 --> 22:51.603
Now hold this.

22:51.639 --> 22:55.007
He took his anger and made
something beautiful out of it.

22:55.042 --> 22:59.445
A guitar's kinda like, uh,
a woman if you hold it nice

22:59.480 --> 23:02.548
and you, uh...

23:02.583 --> 23:04.616
and you finger it the right way,

23:04.652 --> 23:07.719
beautiful songs will come out of it.

23:07.755 --> 23:10.322
My grandmother lived
to be 100 years old.

23:10.357 --> 23:14.059
And, um...

23:14.094 --> 23:16.128
she used to call me up in the afternoon

23:16.163 --> 23:19.031
and she'd say, uh, she'd say, "Buddy,

23:19.066 --> 23:20.399
why don't you come and see me?"

23:20.434 --> 23:22.134
And, uh, I'd have to lay in bed with her

23:22.169 --> 23:23.335
'cause she was sick.

23:23.370 --> 23:24.636
Now, have you ever locked eyes

23:24.672 --> 23:26.872
with a 100-year-old-woman
before?

23:26.907 --> 23:29.341
- Mm, no.
- She, uh,

23:29.376 --> 23:30.843
looked like she was your age.

23:30.878 --> 23:33.412
She... her face took
on that of a little girl

23:33.447 --> 23:35.013
and, uh, she said, "You know, buddy,

23:35.049 --> 23:37.583
you're gonna find out real soon

23:37.618 --> 23:40.252
that life is short.

23:40.287 --> 23:43.322
Even its longest days."

23:43.357 --> 23:45.277
And I thought all the good
songs had been written

23:45.292 --> 23:47.192
till I heard that line.

23:47.228 --> 23:51.196
So, since you came over here
to learn how to play a guitar,

23:51.232 --> 23:53.732
let's try to play
this song together, okay?

23:55.569 --> 23:57.903
The first chord
you're gonna play is an A.

24:01.575 --> 24:03.709
Then it goes to your D.

24:08.315 --> 24:10.949
And then back to your A.

24:12.486 --> 24:15.420
- Nice.
- All right, hot rod, you ready?

24:15.456 --> 24:17.356
Ready.

- Not bad.
- Yes, yes, yes.

25:14.148 --> 25:16.848
That was so cool. Wow.

25:16.884 --> 25:18.116
What do you say to that?

25:18.152 --> 25:20.652
Cage the Elephant was better.

25:23.524 --> 25:26.758
Oh, there's rock critics everywhere.

25:26.794 --> 25:28.927
If it wasn't so great, then just go put

25:28.963 --> 25:31.964
my life's companion back in its stand.

25:35.803 --> 25:38.103
Why are you looking at me like that?

25:38.138 --> 25:40.138
Oh, my God! Oh!

25:48.382 --> 25:49.381
Hi.

25:49.416 --> 25:51.383
Why, hello. How are you?

25:51.418 --> 25:52.718
I'm well. How are you?

25:52.753 --> 25:55.153
- Yeah, really good.
- Oh, yeah? Hi.

25:55.189 --> 25:57.656
- Thanks for coming again.
- Mm-hmm.

25:57.691 --> 25:59.446
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

25:59.447 --> 26:00.659
Oh, that looks better.

26:00.694 --> 26:02.728
Yeah, no, it really hurts,

26:02.763 --> 26:04.630
but I'm pleased it looks nice for you.

26:04.665 --> 26:05.831
Sorry.

26:05.866 --> 26:07.366
Uh, thank you so much for not wearing

26:07.401 --> 26:09.234
your horsey coat again.

26:09.269 --> 26:11.470
I, uh, thought I would de-hay for you.

26:11.505 --> 26:14.973
Oh, so, uh, one quick thing.

26:15.009 --> 26:16.341
Christopher doesn't want me here.

26:16.377 --> 26:18.977
No, actually, quite the opposite.

26:19.013 --> 26:22.080
It's Bill, isn't it?

26:22.116 --> 26:24.182
No, it... it... it... it truly...

26:24.218 --> 26:26.385
It's okay, it's okay.

26:26.420 --> 26:28.180
It's okay, I don't, uh,
I don't want to know.

26:28.188 --> 26:30.989
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

26:31.025 --> 26:32.424
It's Bill.

26:32.459 --> 26:33.992
- I know it's Bill.
- You...

26:34.028 --> 26:36.595
- I know it's Bill.
- He seem to think that

26:36.630 --> 26:38.497
it might cause a bit of a stir.

26:38.532 --> 26:40.766
Oh.

26:40.801 --> 26:42.334
It is what it is.

26:42.369 --> 26:44.236
Mm-hmm.

26:44.271 --> 26:48.573
Well, none of them understand.
It's like...

26:48.609 --> 26:51.276
it's like they're all living
with this ancient idea

26:51.311 --> 26:53.779
of who I am.

26:53.814 --> 26:56.581
But I didn't come to see them.

26:56.617 --> 26:58.183
I came to see you.

27:23.744 --> 27:27.612
I actually don't mind when a guy
takes a big swing and misses.

27:27.648 --> 27:31.483
Like, he has no idea I'm not into guys.

27:31.518 --> 27:33.985
It's when a guy takes a
little swing and misses,

27:34.021 --> 27:36.388
I'm usually not nice to them.

27:37.691 --> 27:39.458
Hey, what about that rigger?

27:39.493 --> 27:41.593
The one that changed the set list?

27:41.628 --> 27:43.562
- Kelly Ann?
- Yeah.

27:43.597 --> 27:46.631
I think Christopher has a crush on her.

27:46.667 --> 27:48.066
Are you shitting me?

27:48.102 --> 27:50.402
- Don't say anything.
- Never.

27:50.437 --> 27:53.905
I'm totally discreet.

27:56.176 --> 27:58.310
I think she's with Reg.

27:58.345 --> 27:59.978
Amazing.

28:00.013 --> 28:03.515
I won't say anything to Christopher.

28:03.550 --> 28:06.852
Hey, where is Winston?

28:06.887 --> 28:10.455
Wes took him for a guitar lesson
with John Mellencamp.

28:10.491 --> 28:13.458
Ah, I love that Wes.

28:13.494 --> 28:17.596
You know, Winston doesn't
always connect with people,

28:17.631 --> 28:19.931
but he's really bonded with that guy.

28:19.967 --> 28:23.668
I'm sorry! I don't know
who Woody Guthrie is.

28:37.217 --> 28:39.785
You fucking asshole! I...

28:39.820 --> 28:41.520
Do you know what you
just did, you little monster?

28:41.555 --> 28:44.623
You disrespected the Man, man. Okay?

28:44.658 --> 28:46.658
The Mellencamp, whose lyrics are quoted

28:46.693 --> 28:48.326
by Bob fucking Dylan!

28:48.362 --> 28:51.696
You spilled disgusting
wheatgrass smoothie

28:51.732 --> 28:54.399
on Woody Guthrie's guitar, man.

28:54.434 --> 28:55.834
Did you not hear the tender story

28:55.869 --> 28:57.302
about his 100-year-old grandma?

28:57.337 --> 29:00.572
With the face?

29:00.607 --> 29:05.477
This is why they call you
"Devil Child" behind your back.

29:05.512 --> 29:07.813
They call me "The Devil Child"?

29:07.848 --> 29:10.048
I... I'm sorry.

29:10.083 --> 29:13.552
I can't look at you.
You gotta ride in back.

29:13.587 --> 29:17.189
Just...

29:17.224 --> 29:18.690
I am truly sorry.

29:18.725 --> 29:20.992
You... you called the
management of Jack Black,

29:21.028 --> 29:22.527
not Jack White.

29:22.563 --> 29:24.329
That was just Jack Black
saying he's sorry,

29:24.364 --> 29:25.697
but he had to fly back to Los Angeles,

29:25.732 --> 29:27.332
and after he thought about it,

29:27.367 --> 29:29.868
he's not sure it fits with
his concept of Tenacious D.

29:29.903 --> 29:32.070
So where's Jack White?

29:32.105 --> 29:33.605
We don't know what city
Jack White is in.

29:33.640 --> 29:37.175
And we are once again
without an opening act.

29:37.211 --> 29:39.277
Uh, actually, uh,

29:39.313 --> 29:42.013
it looks like Black Atlantis
might finally get their shot.

29:42.049 --> 29:44.716
- Oh! Oh, thank you, thank you.
- Yeah? Okay.

29:44.751 --> 29:47.419
I promise, only ballads,
none of the dark stuff, okay.

29:47.454 --> 29:48.787
Perfect.

29:48.822 --> 29:50.288
- Hey, guys.
- All right, hello.

29:50.324 --> 29:52.123
Rick. Natalie.

29:52.159 --> 29:55.594
Guys, uh, thanks to
Natalie, I know I have a problem.

29:55.629 --> 29:58.296
So I decided to fly my neighbor
in from L.A. to help.

29:58.332 --> 30:00.632
Um, everybody, this is Marc Maron

30:00.667 --> 30:02.968
of the WTF podcast and television show.

30:03.003 --> 30:05.537
Wow, the Marc Maron.
I'm a What the Fucker.

30:05.572 --> 30:06.872
Oh, wow, thanks.

30:06.907 --> 30:08.273
The one with Kim Gordon? Amazing.

30:08.308 --> 30:09.941
Right? That was, like, that was intense.

30:09.977 --> 30:11.209
- Yeah, you could tell.
- I was nervous about that.

30:11.245 --> 30:12.577
It was, like, yeah, you could feel that.

30:12.613 --> 30:13.745
- It... it... it came out okay.
- Amazing.

30:13.780 --> 30:15.313
Yeah, yeah. Well, look, I'm a...

30:15.349 --> 30:18.750
I'm a big, uh, SHB fan,
so when, uh, Rick asked me

30:18.785 --> 30:20.652
to help him out, you
know, stay sober, uh,

30:20.687 --> 30:22.721
I was in, you know, and I know Lucius,

30:22.756 --> 30:24.556
and the girls told me he got a little...

30:24.591 --> 30:26.291
a little... little bad.
Little wobbly, huh?

30:26.326 --> 30:27.792
- That one?
- It wasn't pretty.

30:27.828 --> 30:30.328
- All right.
- So who's opening tonight?

30:30.364 --> 30:32.831
Oh, it's a... it's
a bit of a sore subject.

30:32.866 --> 30:35.267
Uh, uh, Reg called
Jack Black and Jack White.

30:35.302 --> 30:37.068
- And which one's opening?
- Uh, neither.

30:37.104 --> 30:38.737
But you know what?
We're... we're actually thinking

30:38.772 --> 30:39.671
- that this might be the day...
- Hey, you know what?

30:39.706 --> 30:41.239
I could do it.

30:41.275 --> 30:42.641
I could do a quick 10,
15 minutes of stand-up.

30:42.676 --> 30:44.309
- That would be awesome.
- I mean, that would be

30:44.344 --> 30:45.777
- hilarious, the only...
- Marc Maron opening for us?

30:45.812 --> 30:47.252
- I was just... uh...
- It'd be a blast.

30:47.281 --> 30:48.313
- I'd be honored, seriously.
- Awesome.

30:48.348 --> 30:49.447
- This is awesome.
- Wow.

30:49.483 --> 30:50.815
- Awesome.
- Let's go.

30:50.851 --> 30:51.850
- Amazing.
- You want to come with me?

30:51.885 --> 30:53.184
- Okay.
- Great idea.

30:53.220 --> 30:54.653
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

30:54.688 --> 30:55.620
- So generous of you.
- See you out there.

30:55.656 --> 30:56.655
Such a pleasure. Thank you.

30:56.690 --> 30:57.989
- Yeah, yeah.
- There you go.

30:58.025 --> 30:59.624
- Problem solved, eh?
- Marc Maron.

30:59.660 --> 31:01.126
Ha!

31:01.161 --> 31:02.127
You don't understand what just happened?

31:02.162 --> 31:03.495
What?

31:03.530 --> 31:06.131
A comedian never opens for a rock band.

31:06.166 --> 31:07.699
What? Is it another fucking curse?

31:07.734 --> 31:10.201
It just doesn't work.
It's like bad chemicals.

31:10.237 --> 31:13.171
Blood and plastic. It... it's
two different parts of the brain.

31:13.206 --> 31:15.487
I mean, Tom and Christopher
are going to fucking flip out.

31:15.509 --> 31:18.209
What... what if I can get
Jack White before showtime?

31:18.245 --> 31:19.778
In less than two hours?

31:19.813 --> 31:21.179
Reg, you didn't get Jack Black.

31:21.214 --> 31:22.714
Jack White doesn't know who you are.

31:22.749 --> 31:24.482
At this point, I
don't think you could get

31:24.518 --> 31:27.953
Jack Blue, Yellow, Green,
or local juggler Jack Orange.

31:27.988 --> 31:30.956
At this point, you couldn't
even get Jack Off.

31:30.991 --> 31:32.557
I'm sorry, I'm not good with insults.

31:32.592 --> 31:34.225
Oh, no, that was pretty solid.

31:34.261 --> 31:36.728
The only good news is that there
can't be any worse news.

31:36.763 --> 31:39.130
Listen, uh, so Janine is here,

31:39.166 --> 31:41.566
and I think that she should
say hi to Christopher.

31:41.601 --> 31:43.969
So let's just get past it.

31:44.004 --> 31:46.504
- Did I hear you correctly?
- Hmm?

31:46.540 --> 31:48.740
You want to bring Janine
backstage to meet Christopher?

31:48.775 --> 31:51.042
Well, he said to offer.

31:51.078 --> 31:52.711
And a junkie will ask for heroin.

31:52.746 --> 31:54.145
It's not like that.

31:54.181 --> 31:56.014
I think that if Christopher sees her,

31:56.049 --> 31:59.918
he will realize that she's
not the old Janine anymore.

31:59.953 --> 32:02.554
Hmm.

32:02.589 --> 32:05.056
Okay, do it.

32:05.092 --> 32:06.925
But just know... you'll wear it.

32:06.960 --> 32:08.660
If the band asks me why,

32:08.695 --> 32:10.028
I'll say you took responsibility.

32:10.063 --> 32:13.031
Oh, thank you. Oh, no hugs.

32:22.109 --> 32:24.109
Oh, well, hello.

32:29.216 --> 32:31.783
Sorry.

32:31.818 --> 32:33.184
I missed you.

32:33.220 --> 32:35.086
I've only been gone five minutes.

32:35.122 --> 32:36.721
- It's only been five minutes.
- It has not been five minutes.

32:36.757 --> 32:38.523
It felt a lot longer than that.

32:38.558 --> 32:39.691
I-I want something for you.

32:39.726 --> 32:41.426
What... what do you want?

32:41.461 --> 32:45.263
I think that you deserve closure.

32:45.298 --> 32:46.865
Closure's an urban myth.

32:46.900 --> 32:48.266
Christopher's asked about you.

32:48.301 --> 32:51.102
You asked about Christopher.

32:51.138 --> 32:55.206
I think it's time that
you put the past in the past.

32:55.242 --> 32:57.242
Yeah.

32:57.277 --> 33:01.279
You are, uh, you're gonna
make me cry now.

33:01.314 --> 33:03.248
Let's go and see Christopher.

33:03.283 --> 33:05.650
And put an end...

33:05.685 --> 33:09.587
to this boring ancient history.

33:15.095 --> 33:16.828
Janine.

33:16.863 --> 33:19.264
- Hi.
- You look good.

33:19.299 --> 33:21.366
Yeah, thanks. You too, Bill.

33:25.539 --> 33:27.605
Sorry, Janine, this is Shelli,
our production manager.

33:27.641 --> 33:29.140
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:29.176 --> 33:30.742
Shelli, this is the actual Janine.

33:30.777 --> 33:32.811
- Yes, yes.
- The one and only.

33:32.846 --> 33:34.446
- That's right.
- Wow, yeah, nice to meet you.

33:34.481 --> 33:37.649
- Well, well, well, wow.
- Wow, indeed.

33:37.684 --> 33:39.684
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:39.719 --> 33:42.821
- This is, uh...
- Something.

33:42.856 --> 33:44.022
- Oh...
- Hey, guys, uh,

33:44.057 --> 33:45.523
this is a set list for tonight.

33:45.559 --> 33:48.326
We're gonna encore with...

33:48.361 --> 33:50.762
- Janine.
- Hi, Chris,

33:50.797 --> 33:54.265
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:54.301 --> 33:55.800
You look amazing. You changed your hair.

33:55.836 --> 33:58.336
Yeah, changed my life.

33:58.371 --> 34:01.306
Sure changed mine.

34:01.341 --> 34:03.108
We've been playing
some of the old songs again.

34:03.143 --> 34:05.043
Yeah, I know. I was there last night.

34:05.078 --> 34:07.712
What'd you think?

34:07.747 --> 34:11.149
Well, you know, a lot's been
coming up for me, too.

34:11.184 --> 34:14.185
Like when I heard the words
"tough angel" again,

34:14.221 --> 34:16.353
it made me think that
everything I've been doing

34:16.389 --> 34:18.623
has just been exactly on schedule.

34:18.658 --> 34:20.558
What do you mean?
Like the emergency room?

34:20.594 --> 34:22.960
'Cause I've heard so many
stories about where you've been,

34:22.996 --> 34:25.964
- what you've been doing...
- Yeah, you... you had my number.

34:25.998 --> 34:27.165
And you never called.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.300
I w... was going to.

34:29.335 --> 34:32.704
Yeah. See, my friends
all read your interviews

34:32.739 --> 34:35.507
where you talk about your
glorious former love,

34:35.542 --> 34:40.078
but you've never reached out to me.

34:40.112 --> 34:42.179
And guess what?

34:42.215 --> 34:43.547
You're about to find out what it's like

34:43.583 --> 34:44.549
on the other side of the fence.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.317
Wha...

34:46.353 --> 34:48.987
What it's like to be used.

34:49.022 --> 34:51.856
What happens when
you take a real person,

34:51.891 --> 34:54.692
not the lyrics of a song,
and discard her.

34:54.728 --> 34:55.860
Janine, you left me.

34:55.896 --> 34:59.330
Oh, my God. You... you left yourself.

34:59.366 --> 35:02.267
You were cruel and selfish.

35:02.302 --> 35:04.502
And you pushed me away and then...

35:04.538 --> 35:06.704
and then you talk about me.

35:06.740 --> 35:09.507
You talk about me like I'm
some gift from above.

35:09.543 --> 35:13.745
Some special gift to give you
sad songs and a weepy story

35:13.780 --> 35:15.680
to tell those jack-off journalists

35:15.715 --> 35:16.881
with a tear in your eye.

35:16.917 --> 35:19.250
Then you show them the tattoo of me?

35:19.286 --> 35:20.718
Your "glorious angel."

35:20.754 --> 35:22.086
Hey, I cherish that tattoo, okay?

35:22.122 --> 35:24.889
Yeah. Oh, my God,
your sad, tired girlfriend.

35:24.925 --> 35:26.891
Well, fuck you!

35:26.927 --> 35:28.393
I have a book deal.

35:28.428 --> 35:30.094
What?

35:30.130 --> 35:32.397
I ke... I kept everything.

35:32.432 --> 35:35.567
Ah, legal tablets,
your notes, your clothes,

35:35.602 --> 35:40.238
that damn boots that
you always loved to wear.

35:40.273 --> 35:43.308
And, uh, this.

35:43.343 --> 35:45.210
The Yearbook is real.

35:45.245 --> 35:46.211
Do you have the Kitchen Sessions?

35:46.246 --> 35:47.245
I have everything!

35:47.280 --> 35:48.813
Oh.

35:48.848 --> 35:50.748
This is like a fucking
street mugging, Janine.

35:50.784 --> 35:53.985
Oh, God, I have dreamed of this moment,

35:54.020 --> 35:56.888
when I get to tell you
that everything you left behind,

35:56.923 --> 35:59.257
all that pain is
going to turn into the money

35:59.292 --> 36:00.792
you never offered me.

36:00.827 --> 36:05.129
Thank God I met a
beautiful man, a lawyer in Boulder,

36:05.165 --> 36:07.665
who showed me how to even the score.

36:07.701 --> 36:09.901
'Cause, Christopher,

36:09.936 --> 36:13.805
I know where all the bodies are buried.

36:13.840 --> 36:16.741
And you are not
getting rid of me this time.

36:16.776 --> 36:18.810
- Not without paying me...
- Okay.

36:18.845 --> 36:20.111
What I deserve.

36:20.146 --> 36:21.279
- You got a show to do.
- Oh, yeah.

36:21.314 --> 36:23.114
Why don't we table this, Janine?

36:23.149 --> 36:24.682
- Or you and I can go back...
- Oh, okay, maybe it's time

36:24.718 --> 36:26.451
we tell your best friend
about the time that

36:26.486 --> 36:27.846
you drove me home from Tulaggi's...

36:27.854 --> 36:29.320
- Yeah.
- And pulled off on the side

36:29.356 --> 36:33.625
of the road and you kissed
me and we fucked.

36:33.660 --> 36:36.461
- I don't remember that.
- You should.

36:36.496 --> 36:38.162
It's your best friend.

36:38.198 --> 36:40.798
You fucked me in your Volvo

36:40.834 --> 36:42.467
across the street from our house.

36:42.502 --> 36:44.936
I remember briefly hugging in private.

36:44.971 --> 36:47.472
I've got the e-mail you
wrote me later, "Sweet William."

36:47.507 --> 36:49.173
What is she talking about, Bill?

36:49.209 --> 36:50.975
- Um...
- I fucked him.

36:51.011 --> 36:53.311
I fucked his brains out, Chris.

36:53.346 --> 36:57.615
Because I knew it would hurt you.

36:57.651 --> 36:59.851
Because he doesn't get sex thrown at him

36:59.886 --> 37:02.220
like you do all the time.

37:02.255 --> 37:04.322
He appreciates it more
because he gets less.

37:04.357 --> 37:06.224
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

37:06.259 --> 37:09.394
I just figured it was time
we all told each other

37:09.429 --> 37:11.129
the fucking truth!

37:11.164 --> 37:12.997
That's great. Keep that.

37:13.033 --> 37:14.832
Ah, Puna.

37:14.868 --> 37:18.369
- That's it, Janine.
- Yeah, that's about it.

37:26.379 --> 37:29.347
I'm sorry.

37:29.382 --> 37:31.549
I had no idea.

37:44.264 --> 37:47.231
Uh, you okay?

37:47.267 --> 37:50.268
Did you do it?

37:53.106 --> 37:54.339
Yeah.

38:05.652 --> 38:06.884
Fuck you, Bill.

38:25.472 --> 38:29.440
Can we just have a moment?

38:29.476 --> 38:32.110
Be quick.

38:36.616 --> 38:39.650
So I just need to know...

38:39.686 --> 38:41.586
for when I replay this
over and over again

38:41.621 --> 38:44.489
for the rest of my life.

38:44.524 --> 38:46.924
Was none of that real?

38:46.960 --> 38:48.226
Like, were the horses and, um,

38:48.261 --> 38:49.621
"I don't want to see Christopher."

38:49.629 --> 38:52.597
I'm sorry I put you in the middle.

38:52.632 --> 38:54.932
Probably going to lose my job over this.

38:54.968 --> 38:57.802
I come from sports, you know, and, um,

38:57.837 --> 39:01.305
accounting.

39:01.341 --> 39:04.142
I don't... I don't understand
show people.

39:08.515 --> 39:12.483
Here, I...

39:12.519 --> 39:14.519
I brought you this.

39:16.723 --> 39:19.424
For my wound?

39:19.459 --> 39:22.260
Yeah.

39:22.295 --> 39:24.462
I'm afraid it won't work.

39:24.497 --> 39:26.497
Reg, I... I'm sorry.

39:26.533 --> 39:29.300
I can't believe you had sex with Janine.

39:29.335 --> 39:30.468
It is what it is.

39:30.503 --> 39:31.636
No, it isn't.

39:31.671 --> 39:33.538
You can't just brush it away.

39:33.573 --> 39:36.307
I don't ever want to hear
"it is what it is" again.

39:36.342 --> 39:38.309
So you don't want to talk
about what happened last night,

39:38.344 --> 39:40.344
but you want to talk
about a mistake that I made

39:40.380 --> 39:42.013
before I ever even met you?

39:42.048 --> 39:45.883
So you do think
last night was a mistake.

39:45.919 --> 39:47.552
Yeah.

39:47.587 --> 39:50.955
Like the best mistake
I've ever made in my life.

39:50.990 --> 39:53.891
I've never done anything like this.

39:53.927 --> 39:56.461
I've never cheated on Sean.

39:56.496 --> 39:58.963
This is not who I am.

39:58.998 --> 40:00.465
And I'm afraid when I talk to him,

40:00.500 --> 40:03.034
he's gonna hear it in my voice.

40:03.069 --> 40:05.369
This has to be over.

40:05.405 --> 40:08.072
We can't allow our personal feelings

40:08.107 --> 40:12.343
to get in the way of our jobs.

40:12.378 --> 40:14.078
Or...

40:14.113 --> 40:15.146
maybe we can.

40:15.181 --> 40:17.181
Maybe.

40:20.253 --> 40:21.853
No. No, no, no.

40:21.888 --> 40:23.888
We... we... we can't.
We can't because I-I...

40:23.923 --> 40:25.890
I want this tour to be a success.

40:25.925 --> 40:27.925
I-and I-I want to
build from it.

40:27.961 --> 40:30.928
And...

40:30.964 --> 40:33.030
I want to manage this band one day.

40:33.066 --> 40:34.365
Wait a second.

40:34.400 --> 40:36.534
You want to manage the band?

40:36.569 --> 40:38.503
Well, why not?

40:38.538 --> 40:42.240
What... why do you think
it's just crazy for me to...

40:42.275 --> 40:44.342
why are you looking at me like that?

40:44.377 --> 40:48.212
Well, because I was thinking
that maybe, uh,

40:48.248 --> 40:50.114
I want to manage the band.

40:50.149 --> 40:53.050
Well, maybe we should discuss

40:53.086 --> 40:56.587
whether we want to do that together.

40:56.623 --> 40:59.524
Let me ask you this.

40:59.559 --> 41:01.259
Do you love Sean?

41:01.294 --> 41:02.627
- How's it going?
- Hey.

41:02.662 --> 41:04.128
- Hi.
- Hey.

41:04.163 --> 41:05.723
Hey, do you, uh, it's a weird question.

41:05.732 --> 41:06.597
Is there anything I need to know?

41:06.633 --> 41:08.132
Do you have any advice for...

41:08.167 --> 41:11.969
for opening for SHB?

41:12.005 --> 41:14.005
Yes.

41:17.644 --> 41:19.310
Yeah, uh, I do.

41:19.345 --> 41:22.747
Uh, mention the band.

41:22.782 --> 41:25.550
Warm 'em up. Do your 15 minutes.

41:25.585 --> 41:27.652
- Oh.
- Yeah.

41:27.687 --> 41:29.587
- Great.
- Not what you were looking for?

41:29.622 --> 41:30.922
Yeah, but, you know, you
did the best you could. I...

41:30.957 --> 41:32.423
- Let me get you a smoothie.
- Okay.

41:32.458 --> 41:33.758
- We'll talk about it.
- Thanks a lot.

41:33.793 --> 41:34.825
Is this what you're gonna wear on stage?

41:34.861 --> 41:36.160
Why? What? Is that a joke?

41:36.195 --> 41:40.898
My mother never understood.

41:40.934 --> 41:45.903
My father refused to talk to
me because I wasn't a boy.

41:45.939 --> 41:48.906
I'm more a boy than his own son.

41:49.943 --> 41:51.409
Fuck!

41:51.444 --> 41:54.245
I want so much for
you and Laurie to make it.

41:54.280 --> 41:58.182
And I want you to have a
perfect, beautiful child.

41:58.217 --> 42:00.351
Like Winston.

42:00.386 --> 42:03.454
Dude, your son is a terror.

42:03.489 --> 42:05.323
- Pardon?
- And we're outta here, Donna.

42:05.358 --> 42:07.358
They called him
"Devil Child" before Wes.

42:07.393 --> 42:10.461
Donna, honey, let... let's hit it.

42:12.398 --> 42:14.298
No, no, no, it's... it's okay.

42:14.334 --> 42:15.866
Thank you for that.

42:15.902 --> 42:17.635
I need this kinda truth.

42:17.670 --> 42:19.370
I don't get it from Christopher anymore.

42:19.405 --> 42:20.705
And I'm so worried about Rick.

42:20.740 --> 42:22.707
We all are.

42:22.742 --> 42:25.610
I love you.

42:25.645 --> 42:26.978
I want truth, Bill.

42:27.013 --> 42:28.646
Copy that. More truth.

42:28.681 --> 42:30.348
But that's actually how
you know that your neighborhood

42:30.383 --> 42:32.149
has fully transitioned
into a hipster neighborhood

42:32.185 --> 42:34.018
is when you walk into a storefront

42:34.053 --> 42:36.687
and you're really not sure
what they're selling there.

42:36.723 --> 42:38.289
You have that weird moment
when you're, like,

42:38.324 --> 42:41.058
"Okay, there's a saddle. I don't know.

42:41.094 --> 42:44.528
A box of records, two old typewriters,
and a macramé owl.

42:44.564 --> 42:46.230
What the fuck is going on in here?"

42:46.265 --> 42:48.566
How long has he been up there?

42:48.601 --> 42:49.800
Weeks.

42:49.836 --> 42:51.369
You know what?
Can... can I do something?

42:51.404 --> 42:52.870
I... you know, I'm also a musician.

42:52.905 --> 42:56.574
I don't... I don't get to play, like...

42:56.609 --> 42:59.176
No, just o... I
just wanna play one song.

42:59.212 --> 43:00.177
One song, man.

43:03.883 --> 43:06.350
You know what? Maybe I... maybe
I'll just steal this guitar

43:06.386 --> 43:09.387
and we'll call it even.

43:11.724 --> 43:13.090
Hey.

43:13.126 --> 43:14.992
There you are.

43:15.028 --> 43:17.428
Do you believe what we just witnessed?

43:17.463 --> 43:21.065
I... ha... have you ever
seen anyone that... honest?

43:23.803 --> 43:28.272
I suppose honesty is in
the eye of the beheaded.

43:28.307 --> 43:30.875
So, uh, I... I'm gonna be leaving

43:30.910 --> 43:33.344
pretty quickly after the show.

43:33.379 --> 43:36.247
So if I don't see you, um,

43:36.282 --> 43:38.616
thank you, Reg.

43:38.651 --> 43:40.451
I... I've got a ton to
write about for the site.

43:40.486 --> 43:43.754
Uh, lots of swag.

43:43.790 --> 43:47.958
This has... this has been...
everything to me.

43:51.998 --> 43:53.998
- Bye.
- Bye.

43:57.637 --> 43:59.403
Oh, and hey, uh, about your box set?

43:59.439 --> 44:02.373
I do have some killer
stuff. It's all yours.

44:02.408 --> 44:04.775
Well, brilliant. I, um, I will find you.

44:10.616 --> 44:11.949
What's that?

44:11.984 --> 44:15.419
It's your laundry.

44:15.455 --> 44:19.156
I...

44:19.192 --> 44:21.192
Well, thank you.

44:27.100 --> 44:28.899
Listen, uh,

44:28.935 --> 44:31.435
I was thinking about watching
that movie that you mentioned,

44:31.471 --> 44:33.804
uh, Local Hero, tonight after the show

44:33.840 --> 44:35.740
because you said that you were
thinking about watching it, too,

44:35.775 --> 44:37.174
and I... and I
just thought that maybe...

44:37.210 --> 44:39.310
that we could watch it...

44:39.345 --> 44:41.345
together.

44:44.317 --> 44:47.418
We've got to load out after the show.

44:47.453 --> 44:50.321
Can't really watch a movie.

44:50.356 --> 44:52.356
Another time then, perhaps.

45:01.567 --> 45:05.603
Are... are you gonna be all right?

45:05.638 --> 45:07.638
Oh, yeah.

45:09.842 --> 45:14.311
I suppose some of these songs
might be getting to me a bit.

45:14.347 --> 45:17.314
Yeah.

45:17.350 --> 45:19.350
They'll do that.

45:35.501 --> 45:37.067
- I quit.
- Okay, dude,

45:37.103 --> 45:38.702
I quit you in the parking lot.

45:38.738 --> 45:41.372
I'm the first one who said
"quit," and I quit.

45:41.407 --> 45:43.541
Perfect, you quit first. Thank you.

45:43.576 --> 45:45.509
All right, we tried something
and it didn't work out.

45:45.545 --> 45:46.877
All right, I moved on.

45:46.913 --> 45:49.079
Why?

45:49.115 --> 45:52.049
D... be... because, man,
you're a selfish little prick.

45:55.621 --> 45:57.888
You know, maybe you
should have listened to what

45:57.924 --> 45:59.757
John Mellencamp said about anger.

45:59.792 --> 46:01.926
I'm 12, and I got it.

46:01.961 --> 46:06.831
Clearly, you missed it.

46:06.866 --> 46:11.335
Hey, Jeannie, uh, get this off
in the morning, thank you.

46:11.370 --> 46:13.504
The comedian did a killer 45 minutes.

46:13.539 --> 46:15.773
Oh, my God, I know. It was excruciating.

46:15.808 --> 46:17.741
Yeah, I mean, the band never recovered.

46:17.777 --> 46:20.611
It's like the...
Janine incident didn't help.

46:20.646 --> 46:22.880
Christopher wept
through the entire show.

46:22.915 --> 46:25.416
Get ready for another call from Preston.

46:25.451 --> 46:27.451
Thank you.

46:31.891 --> 46:34.058
You know what we have to do now.

46:43.336 --> 46:44.702
- Dude.
- Yeah.

46:44.737 --> 46:47.137
That was seriously the...
see you later, ladies.

46:47.173 --> 46:49.773
That was seriously the best
set I've ever had in my life.

46:49.809 --> 46:52.309
That was amazing, man. Check this out.

46:52.345 --> 46:54.578
Rick lent me his guitar.
I'm working on some songs.

46:54.614 --> 46:56.580
I think I'm gonna do a couple
more songs tomorrow night.

46:56.616 --> 46:58.082
What was... how long was I up there?

46:58.117 --> 46:59.984
- Like, 14 minutes?
- 45 minutes.

47:00.019 --> 47:01.652
And, Marc, about tomorrow night,

47:01.687 --> 47:03.087
and I know you're a busy guy,

47:03.122 --> 47:04.889
but le... let's actually walk and talk.

47:04.924 --> 47:06.624
Oh, okay.

47:06.659 --> 47:08.225
I'll put...

47:08.261 --> 47:09.593
- That'll be okay there?
- Yeah, that's great.

47:09.629 --> 47:11.328
All right. So,
listen, I don't know if you

47:11.364 --> 47:12.924
ever heard my Lorne Michaels interview,

47:12.932 --> 47:15.099
but I'm starting to realize
that my entire podcast

47:15.134 --> 47:16.433
has been about me getting to the bottom

47:16.469 --> 47:18.168
of that rejection from "SNL," dude.

47:18.204 --> 47:19.603
And I want to hear more about
that, fascinating, by all means.

47:19.639 --> 47:20.604
Well, listen, here's what I'm saying.

47:20.640 --> 47:22.106
Now, I feel whole.

47:22.141 --> 47:23.841
Like this is what I should be doing.

47:23.876 --> 47:26.243
I should be out, you know,
like, helping Rick stay sober.

47:26.279 --> 47:27.845
- Yeah.
- And just being, like,

47:27.880 --> 47:29.146
a kick ass opener for
the band for the whole tour.

47:29.181 --> 47:30.848
- Yeah.
- For the whole tour, man.

47:30.883 --> 47:33.517
Marc, I have to let you go.

47:33.552 --> 47:36.420
What? Why?

47:36.455 --> 47:37.988
I just... I killed in there, man.

47:38.024 --> 47:41.825
- I slayed.
- Y-you were very charismatic.

47:41.861 --> 47:42.960
All right, thanks.

47:42.995 --> 47:44.628
Maybe... too charismatic.

47:44.664 --> 47:46.463
Wait... I'm too charisma...

47:46.499 --> 47:47.765
you're gonna fire me
'cause I'm too charismatic?

47:47.800 --> 47:49.500
What does that even fucking mean?

47:49.535 --> 47:51.535
You're gonna fire the
doctor that's curing your cancer?

47:51.570 --> 47:54.605
Do you not vote for the guy for
president 'cause he's too smart?

47:54.640 --> 47:56.273
I mean, what... what kind
of bullshit is this?

47:56.309 --> 47:58.309
You know, don't
think of it as being fired.

47:58.344 --> 48:01.545
It's just, you know,
it... it is what it is.

48:01.580 --> 48:03.781
It's... it's like
Lorne Michaels all over again.

48:03.816 --> 48:05.182
- That's what it is.
- Not at all.

48:05.217 --> 48:07.484
And, Marc, w... we'd
love to have you around,

48:07.520 --> 48:09.720
to... to stay and be
Rick's sober companion.

48:09.755 --> 48:11.388
- That'd be...
- Fuck Rick.

48:11.424 --> 48:12.690
- Excuse me?
- Fuck you.

48:12.725 --> 48:14.525
- Well, hold on now.
- I'm out.

48:14.560 --> 48:16.560
I'm out.

48:29.008 --> 48:30.307
You were amazing.

48:30.343 --> 48:33.577
Thanks. Where are you headed?

48:33.612 --> 48:35.045
Where you're headed.

48:35.081 --> 48:37.081
I'm lost.

48:39.218 --> 48:41.218
Not anymore.

48:44.056 --> 48:46.690
Uh, this came for Winston,
but I couldn't find him.

48:46.726 --> 48:48.726
It's from John Mellencamp.

49:42.615 --> 49:44.148
Hi, honey.

49:47.319 --> 49:51.155
Yeah, no, um, uh, I'm so sorry.
It's... it's been a crazy day.
