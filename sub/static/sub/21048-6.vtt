WEBVTT

00:07.766 --> 00:12.029
Whatever's going on, whatever
trouble he's left us with, I'm here.

00:14.274 --> 00:17.441
Elena.
She's the only survivor from the explosion.

00:19.064 --> 00:21.953
But these don't belong to me.
They belong to John Brandeis.

00:21.983 --> 00:24.737
so what are they doing locked in
a vault belonging to Constantine?

00:27.208 --> 00:31.315
Elena, who is she?
No, it's a file.

00:33.164 --> 00:35.583
Please remain calm and
stay where you are, thank you

00:35.613 --> 00:38.959
By order of Interpol,
all the art is seized

00:38.989 --> 00:40.907
and you are to stay
exactly where you are.

01:09.096 --> 01:11.045
A witness remarked...

01:11.922 --> 01:15.514
for her, you said you'd be absent
for much of the night.

01:16.864 --> 01:19.704
Absent? From my own gala?

01:21.308 --> 01:24.399
were you?
I don't believe so.

01:25.735 --> 01:29.090
There was a lot to attend to.
Tell me again.

01:29.678 --> 01:32.657
The last time you saw Antal.
Didn't.

01:34.481 --> 01:38.212
I think I recall seeing him early on
when the guests were arriving and

01:39.824 --> 01:40.437
then...

01:44.323 --> 01:44.894
nothing.

01:46.982 --> 01:50.184
How will this look, the family
being kept here like this?

01:52.025 --> 01:54.350
Anyone would think you had a grudge.

01:55.770 --> 01:58.860
Can you think of any reason why
someone might want to hurt Tehalte?

01:59.504 --> 02:00.938
i have no idea.

02:01.328 --> 02:04.279
It wouldn't do any good for someone to
suspect this was something personal.

02:05.741 --> 02:06.938
What is?

02:08.360 --> 02:11.939
Nothing? As in you saw nothing or...

02:12.510 --> 02:14.334
you didn't see Antal
for the rest of the night.

02:15.740 --> 02:18.023
I was involved with the auction
most of the night.

02:20.003 --> 02:21.743
I don't recall seeing him again.

02:24.211 --> 02:27.510
Is this attack related, in any way,
to our collection being seized?

02:28.192 --> 02:30.977
Well, we were hoping you might be
able to help us with that one, dear.

02:31.728 --> 02:32.508
I wish I could.

02:34.313 --> 02:35.343
I wish I could.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.833
<i>You and I are cut from the same ice</i>

02:42.863 --> 02:46.891
<i>Sincerity made us the perfect heist</i>

02:46.921 --> 02:50.664
<i>Burning all the gold to sapphire skies</i>

02:50.694 --> 02:54.409
<i>But the breeze is cold in paradise</i>

02:54.439 --> 02:58.104
<i>I can feel the whispers in the street</i>

02:58.134 --> 03:01.139
<i>Every night I shiver in my sleep</i>

03:01.423 --> 03:07.701
<i>No reality, cause it's all a dream</i>

03:08.702 --> 03:12.266
<i>Was it love? It was wild
Brought me to my knees</i>

03:12.296 --> 03:15.732
<i>Sparking fires,
sparring wars with expensive things</i>

03:15.762 --> 03:23.297
<i>I tiptoe right round my baby
All this world is mad, mad crazy</i>

03:23.662 --> 03:27.295
<i>Was it love? It was wild
Brought me to my knees</i>

03:27.325 --> 03:30.650
<i>Sparking fires,
sparring wars with expensive things</i>

03:30.680 --> 03:38.026
<i>I tiptoe right round my baby
All this world is mad, mad crazy</i>

03:51.219 --> 03:53.321
I'm going to get a coffee.

03:53.837 --> 03:54.407
Anyone?

04:16.185 --> 04:18.259
What the hell happened
to you last night?

04:40.164 --> 04:42.364
Gentlemen! Please...

04:48.698 --> 04:51.301
We are still waiting for CCTV footage.

04:52.709 --> 04:56.440
Look, that's her.
The girl on the yacht.

04:56.899 --> 04:59.447
She has killed twice now, at least.

05:02.092 --> 05:04.932
We should take over the case
from the Maritime Authority.

05:07.341 --> 05:07.758
Yeah.

05:10.139 --> 05:10.807
Okay.

05:26.270 --> 05:30.962
I told you I'm sorry.
I stayed late at the bank,

05:31.296 --> 05:33.036
had a few drinks and passed out.

05:34.455 --> 05:35.903
I didn't know this
was going to happen.

05:36.376 --> 05:39.202
That may be the story you told
the police but I don't believe you.

06:27.717 --> 06:29.374
This incident changes things.

06:30.961 --> 06:33.508
There may be something
in what you suggested before:

06:33.538 --> 06:37.131
that your husband's death
may not have been an accident.

06:37.646 --> 06:39.094
That's no good to us now.

06:40.027 --> 06:41.586
Antal's dead, isn't he?

06:41.878 --> 06:43.395
If you had listened to what I said,

06:45.183 --> 06:47.925
She's gone to bed,
at least, just for a nap.

06:48.510 --> 06:51.294
What about Christos!
Asleep too, I imagine.

06:52.690 --> 06:55.864
We have reason to believe
it is the girl we are tracking.

06:56.351 --> 06:58.662
Her name is Elena.
Elena?

07:00.447 --> 07:01.673
and why would she do this?

07:02.410 --> 07:04.666
Does this have anything
to do with Constantine?

07:04.833 --> 07:09.037
We don't know yet. We think she's
responsible for a previous homicide

07:09.304 --> 07:12.256
and we have a video that puts
her in the scene of your crime,

07:12.286 --> 07:14.720
yet no one seems to have seen anything.

07:17.884 --> 07:18.705
Or Antal.

07:19.359 --> 07:21.670
I don't feel safe here, I don't
think my children are safe.

07:22.116 --> 07:25.123
I'll take Ada with me, the boys can

07:25.373 --> 07:28.102
stay at a hotel until some new
arrangements can be made.

07:28.132 --> 07:30.962
or until this monster is caught.

07:31.658 --> 07:34.582
i will be placing officers here,
just in case

07:34.971 --> 07:36.364
and I'll be contacting you.

07:38.510 --> 07:39.360
Excuse me.

08:02.070 --> 08:03.059
Where's Elena?

08:03.716 --> 08:05.401
I didn't get it?
What?

08:05.610 --> 08:07.907
I know. I will get it,
just give me more time.

08:07.937 --> 08:08.644
You're dead.

08:52.511 --> 08:55.741
bright and breezy,
even after last night's events.

08:56.079 --> 08:58.654
Don't you ever sleep?
Not if I can help it.

08:59.336 --> 09:00.185
Vampiric.

09:02.107 --> 09:05.044
I hear there was more drama
after I left the party.

09:05.284 --> 09:10.101
I hear there was murder most foul.
Word gets around quickly.

09:12.342 --> 09:15.641
It is a body, Jukes, not a girl!
That's pretty top gossip

09:16.922 --> 09:18.718
I need more from you.
More what?

09:18.899 --> 09:21.252
More information, more evidence.

09:21.881 --> 09:24.178
I'm afraid you squeezed
all you can from me.

09:26.350 --> 09:30.262
See, if I can't press charges, then
I have to release the collection

09:31.694 --> 09:33.114
and that means that you won't be

09:33.144 --> 09:36.052
buying any of it on the cheap
from a closed division.

09:45.855 --> 09:46.509
Alright.

09:48.753 --> 09:53.153
I believe you might want to have a
look in the Principality Art Free Port.

09:53.626 --> 09:55.505
Beyond that,
I really cannot help you.

09:57.719 --> 09:58.860
You're most welcome.

09:59.254 --> 10:00.326
i didn't thank you.

10:05.577 --> 10:08.682
Irina, there's something else
I need to talk to you about.

10:10.311 --> 10:11.202
Go on

10:11.981 --> 10:12.872
Christos...

10:14.208 --> 10:14.974
He's...

10:16.874 --> 10:18.002
He's an addict.

10:22.791 --> 10:23.988
You knew?

10:24.823 --> 10:25.825
Suspected.

10:26.517 --> 10:30.805
It's not the first time.
He needs help.

10:33.496 --> 10:38.897
It's the stress, the business going
under, the funeral, it's... it's...

10:39.621 --> 10:42.071
it's just a relapse,
he'll snap out of it!

10:42.101 --> 10:42.851
Heroin?

10:43.707 --> 10:45.183
You don't snap out of heroin.

10:50.835 --> 10:54.385
Oh, yes, you're quite right.

10:58.021 --> 11:00.624
He promised me the last time
that that would be it.

11:01.807 --> 11:04.647
So, he has a history?
He has his troubles.

11:04.939 --> 11:08.127
I'd rather not discuss it with you.
I'm not judging.

11:08.294 --> 11:10.201
No. If you don't have children,
you can't.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.771
There's a place
just past the university.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.692
I'd prefer a private facility.

11:18.722 --> 11:22.228
State facilities are much more strict.
If you put him in a private facility,

11:22.258 --> 11:24.065
he'll have himself
checked out in a week.

11:26.899 --> 11:28.528
We're so lucky you're here, Georgina.

11:33.971 --> 11:34.806
Christos.

11:36.213 --> 11:37.299
Christos.

11:38.468 --> 11:39.080
Come on.

11:39.345 --> 11:40.459
What? What is it?

11:40.876 --> 11:42.644
We're going to rehab, my love.

11:44.287 --> 11:46.765
You're fucking kidding me!
I'm not, my love, get up.

11:47.166 --> 11:50.674
Did she put you up to this?
Christos, your mother and I agreed.

11:50.704 --> 11:53.111
Agreed what, that you talk
about me when I'm not there?

11:53.932 --> 11:55.491
What did she say?
It's for the best.

11:55.521 --> 11:57.988
She's lying! Ok?

11:58.349 --> 12:01.677
It's not what you think, a few
lines of coke is not a big deal.

12:01.707 --> 12:03.946
She's had it in for me...
It's for the best.

13:30.761 --> 13:31.903
Did you see his wrist?

13:38.234 --> 13:40.642
Do you think there's
more he's not telling me?

13:48.727 --> 13:51.358
We're here, honey. Let's go.

14:59.249 --> 15:00.836
Hey, um...

15:01.184 --> 15:02.395
can you come over?

15:03.230 --> 15:04.232
I'm at my Mum's.

15:14.422 --> 15:17.972
Christos, I want to ask you something
and i don't want you to lie to me.

15:18.139 --> 15:20.046
What are those marks on your wrists?

15:22.085 --> 15:23.937
I want the truth.
No, you don't.

15:25.621 --> 15:27.473
Does Georgina know
anything about this?

15:27.503 --> 15:28.211
Ask her.

15:28.921 --> 15:30.675
I'm asking you.
I'm still your mother!

15:31.440 --> 15:32.442
She's nothing.

15:32.721 --> 15:35.881
What is this big secret?
Mum, it doesn't matter, ok?

15:37.663 --> 15:40.196
It actually doesn't. She wanted
something and she got it.

15:40.226 --> 15:41.282
So, fair fucks to her.

15:42.537 --> 15:43.984
What did she want?
It doesn't matter!

15:44.014 --> 15:45.182
I don't want
to hear this right now.

15:47.186 --> 15:49.957
You know, you weren't concerned
with my well-being before.

15:49.987 --> 15:52.134
Why do you care so much who knows...
Christos!

15:52.301 --> 15:54.334
You've never made
an intervention in your life.

15:54.515 --> 15:56.561
My whole life is
a fucking intervention!

16:01.307 --> 16:03.729
Do you think it's easy
to see you like this?

16:05.400 --> 16:07.056
Fucking junkie.
Yeah!

16:09.398 --> 16:11.097
Whose fault is it, hmm?

16:13.032 --> 16:14.132
Who kept pushing...

16:14.605 --> 16:16.610
and pushing? Who turned a blind eye?

16:16.640 --> 16:18.071
I...
When I've clearly

16:18.101 --> 16:21.111
been snorting everything under
the sun for the last few years.
(<i>I've always treated you like a grownup!</i>)

16:21.141 --> 16:23.826
Yeah, since i was a fucking kid!
Christos!

16:25.817 --> 16:26.875
Good job, Mom.

16:27.955 --> 16:30.433
You know, I don't even know
why you're here, I really don't.

16:33.941 --> 16:36.099
I'm trying.
Yeah, well, don't.

16:37.508 --> 16:38.469
Christos Clios...

16:39.875 --> 16:42.378
Christos! Christos!

16:44.689 --> 16:45.513
Yeah, sure.

17:03.940 --> 17:04.608
Hello?

17:05.053 --> 17:07.462
Hello, is that
Georgina Clios' secretary?

17:08.088 --> 17:08.520
No.

17:09.555 --> 17:10.961
I'm her executive Assistant.

17:11.114 --> 17:12.742
My name is Brigita Moss.

17:12.936 --> 17:15.819
I'm a legal representative of the
Principality at Freeport.

17:16.097 --> 17:19.243
We haven't been able to get a hold of
Madame Clios and she left her details.

17:20.003 --> 17:22.315
We have a duty
to inform Madame Clios

17:22.345 --> 17:24.917
that her request for a warrant
has been lodged with the Court.

17:25.502 --> 17:28.649
A warrant?
Yes, to search the Clios vault.

17:29.433 --> 17:31.313
We have, of course,
been less than helpful

17:31.343 --> 17:32.231
but it's Interpol,

17:32.261 --> 17:34.556
so I imagine it would
only take a few hours

17:35.002 --> 17:37.581
Right.
As normal protocol,

17:37.611 --> 17:42.773
the warrant will also allow access to
inventories, manifests, CCTV, et.cetera.

17:42.803 --> 17:46.565
Yes, of course.
Well, thanks for letting us know.

18:17.055 --> 18:17.905
Fancy one?

18:19.464 --> 18:20.257
Small one.

18:26.875 --> 18:27.794
Have you slept?

18:30.189 --> 18:31.121
Not a wink.

18:32.388 --> 18:33.599
You were no...

18:35.833 --> 18:37.726
I didn't know you
had a taste for whiskey.

18:41.861 --> 18:42.710
I don't.

18:50.791 --> 18:56.711
After Negrescu left, I remember
us not liking Antal at first.

18:56.892 --> 18:58.757
We were just kids.

19:00.229 --> 19:04.057
He was really cool.
He taught us how to fight.

19:04.087 --> 19:05.811
He was trained in martial arts.

19:08.289 --> 19:10.001
Christos wanted to be a ninja.

19:15.312 --> 19:16.551
Did you see anything?

19:20.880 --> 19:22.050
Poor Christos.

19:25.927 --> 19:27.445
Yeah, I know.

19:28.600 --> 19:32.860
There'll be theories. Was he ok?
Not really,

19:34.380 --> 19:35.939
but that's the hard bit, isn't it?

19:42.766 --> 19:43.462
Adam?

19:45.773 --> 19:46.942
Do you fancy a walk?

19:58.720 --> 19:59.374
Buddy!

20:01.644 --> 20:04.205
Aw, come on, Lucas,
don't be like that.

20:04.577 --> 20:07.082
I apologized for all that business.
It's water under the bridge.

20:07.416 --> 20:10.437
Maybe you should try having a gun
pointed at you by a mad woman.

20:10.646 --> 20:12.498
Actually, you make it sound quite sexy.

20:14.607 --> 20:18.463
Alright. Look, the mad woman
has had a change of heart.

20:19.145 --> 20:22.152
Ever since she met you, she's talked
of little else except your work.

20:22.654 --> 20:25.048
She wants to buy my work?
Very much so.

20:26.409 --> 20:27.230
Which one?

20:28.163 --> 20:32.757
She's hoping to acquire a set.

20:33.606 --> 20:35.026
The five, in fact.

20:37.155 --> 20:40.746
Five pieces?
Mm-hm. She wants you...

20:41.373 --> 20:44.074
to curate her selection yourself.

20:44.352 --> 20:45.925
She's got very specific requirements.
Very specific.

20:50.762 --> 20:52.753
This woodland goes on for miles.

20:56.343 --> 20:59.392
We used to roam it as kids,
Christos and I.

21:00.046 --> 21:01.926
Building dens, stuff.

21:03.889 --> 21:06.909
Sorry, was there something
you wanted to talk about?

21:08.180 --> 21:10.254
I think your father was using me.

21:12.120 --> 21:12.913
What do you mean?

21:13.612 --> 21:16.368
Christos told me about the
trouble that the bank was in.

21:17.037 --> 21:19.041
The money laundering.
Did you know about that?

21:22.396 --> 21:24.373
I knew enough, I suppose.

21:26.044 --> 21:28.801
Dad has always kept me out of
the business and other things.

21:28.831 --> 21:30.054
Did you know about Elena?

21:31.571 --> 21:32.225
The girl?

21:33.005 --> 21:34.773
Whoever that girl is
that they're looking for,

21:35.350 --> 21:36.464
that's not Elena

21:37.313 --> 21:40.376
Elena's a code name for a file.
It went down with the yacht.

21:45.326 --> 21:46.774
But it was blown up.

21:47.554 --> 21:49.586
I think so.
So...

21:52.148 --> 21:53.540
Why kill Antal?

21:55.905 --> 21:56.866
What would they be after?

21:57.214 --> 21:59.622
I don't know, that's what
I'm trying to figure out.

22:03.116 --> 22:06.652
I cannot square the man that I married
with everything that I've learned.

22:07.842 --> 22:09.735
If he knew that
Christos was on heroin,

22:10.919 --> 22:13.661
If he knew that dirty money was
being laundered through that bank,

22:13.828 --> 22:14.733
maybe he never...

22:16.706 --> 22:17.194
What?

22:18.461 --> 22:19.324
loved me.

22:24.252 --> 22:25.839
it's like he died twice.

22:40.752 --> 22:42.952
Christos?
You've got Group now

22:42.982 --> 22:44.873
and we'll start you on Methadone.

22:45.193 --> 22:50.749
Listen, I'm just here to
take a break from everything; rest.

22:52.211 --> 22:55.274
happy to do a few group sessions
or whatever, but I'm not staying.

22:56.847 --> 22:58.475
Ok?
Ok.

23:00.356 --> 23:02.737
No cellphones.
I don't have one.

23:06.941 --> 23:09.377
I just heard it. Hand it over.

23:17.385 --> 23:18.638
If you must know,

23:19.414 --> 23:21.571
my company's essentially collapsing

23:21.601 --> 23:24.912
and you're asking me to sit in some
circle and talk about my feelings.

23:24.942 --> 23:26.137
I need to make some calls.

23:27.001 --> 23:28.866
great. Later.

23:36.179 --> 23:38.003
I'll wait for you outside, alright?

23:42.747 --> 23:43.526
Fuck!

24:08.626 --> 24:09.183
Hey, you!

25:13.208 --> 25:14.906
I'm ok, I'm ok.

25:56.908 --> 25:59.901
In a weird way, I always felt
more at home here than the villa.

26:03.448 --> 26:04.854
There we were Clioses

26:06.538 --> 26:08.849
Here, we were just normal kids.

26:09.434 --> 26:11.091
It's smaller than I remember.

26:11.313 --> 26:13.722
Oh, believe me, I've
lived in much smaller

26:13.752 --> 26:16.568
and worse and with more bugs.
New York?

26:19.087 --> 26:20.145
do you want to go back?

26:23.278 --> 26:23.820
Yeah.

26:25.346 --> 26:26.544
I do, actually.

26:27.240 --> 26:27.991
Seriously?

26:29.676 --> 26:32.975
What is here for me now?
Everything is telling me to leave.

26:33.683 --> 26:34.685
Why don't we.

26:35.938 --> 26:36.662
Let's go.

26:37.581 --> 26:38.861
Where would we go?

26:39.251 --> 26:39.961
Anywhere.

26:41.451 --> 26:44.193
New York, London, anywhere.

26:45.114 --> 26:46.520
There's no one keeping us here.

26:47.967 --> 26:49.499
You're sweet, Adam.

26:50.974 --> 26:54.482
You've always been really kind to me,
even when you didn't have to be.

26:54.742 --> 26:56.732
You do know,
I think the world of you,

26:57.735 --> 27:00.338
that you've been great with Adriana

27:01.869 --> 27:05.433
You can't help it if Christos is
a prick and mother is an ice queen.

27:14.372 --> 27:16.168
Do you really think
she killed Antal?

27:17.713 --> 27:18.534
That girl?

27:24.009 --> 27:25.039
If she did...

27:33.497 --> 27:34.305
I saw it.

27:35.961 --> 27:37.507
I saw her kill him.

27:37.966 --> 27:38.453
What?

27:41.895 --> 27:45.570
There was nothing I could do.
I was drunk.

27:47.631 --> 27:51.153
They were so quick.
Why didn't you say anything?

27:52.083 --> 27:52.918
I don't know.

27:58.765 --> 28:02.399
She was on
the yacht with Dad. I...

28:03.850 --> 28:06.745
I thought maybe it
would be bad for you if I did.

28:10.534 --> 28:11.829
I'm so sorry.

28:28.752 --> 28:29.281
I...

28:30.756 --> 28:32.441
would like to go back now

28:36.575 --> 28:38.093
Yeah, of course.

28:39.959 --> 28:41.295
Let's not rush this.

28:58.289 --> 29:00.030
Can't believe I'm here with Mum.

29:00.696 --> 29:03.815
Yeah, at least you have one.
Yeah, I guess so.

29:05.792 --> 29:07.866
You know, it's
kind of a job to be a killjoy.

29:17.667 --> 29:20.228
So hard to believe.
What?

29:21.793 --> 29:22.754
Antal's dead.

29:24.021 --> 29:24.898
Are you scared?

29:25.733 --> 29:27.515
I don't know. I mean...

29:27.877 --> 29:30.466
It's so surreal but
real at the same time.

29:31.780 --> 29:34.564
Like I'm in a nightmare
and I can't wake up.

29:38.240 --> 29:39.506
Ever since Dad died,

29:41.016 --> 29:43.425
Everyone's gone mad.
I'm going nuts.

29:44.079 --> 29:46.808
You know you haven't.
You know you're just...

29:46.838 --> 29:48.951
Mental!
You're fucking crazy

29:49.466 --> 29:50.942
but that's what
I like about you.

29:56.571 --> 29:57.949
The gala was weird.

30:00.037 --> 30:00.733
Yeah.

30:02.431 --> 30:05.703
Everyone turned into
strange versions of themselves.

30:08.375 --> 30:09.197
i like that.

30:25.124 --> 30:26.530
Want to go to my room?

30:27.706 --> 30:28.166
Yeah.

30:28.653 --> 30:30.171
Yeah?
Yeah.

30:45.028 --> 30:46.198
Bonjour.
Bonjour.

30:47.437 --> 30:49.595
I have a delivery
for the Clios vaults.

30:51.491 --> 30:52.939
I'm the artist.

30:59.460 --> 31:00.017
Ok.

31:12.855 --> 31:15.027
Christos, would
you like to say anything?

31:16.800 --> 31:18.623
Any thing at all?
No.

31:20.057 --> 31:21.101
It's ok, Christos.

31:21.491 --> 31:24.763
It's hard at first but it's really
good to just break the ice and say...

31:25.328 --> 31:26.595
well, whatever comes into your head.

31:28.112 --> 31:30.465
Whatever comes into my head? Ok.

31:32.386 --> 31:34.196
Go fuck yourself, I guess.

31:55.624 --> 31:56.125
Thank you.

32:50.511 --> 32:54.158
In for a penny, in for a pound.

36:25.083 --> 36:27.171
I half expected you
to be packed by now.

36:28.411 --> 36:30.875
You weren't really
serious, were you?

36:31.821 --> 36:33.868
No, I wasn't.

36:40.331 --> 36:41.681
Look, there's something...

36:42.684 --> 36:45.788
I need to tell you.
I wasn't going to because

36:46.282 --> 36:48.997
I didn't want to hurt you.
Do you understand?

36:50.130 --> 36:51.313
The girl...

36:52.135 --> 36:54.905
from the yacht.
The one the police are after.

36:56.951 --> 36:57.926
I do know her.

36:59.829 --> 37:02.223
You said earlier that you
wondered if Dad ever loved you.

37:04.242 --> 37:06.233
But I've met her before, once,

37:07.485 --> 37:09.727
at Dad's apartment in Monaco.

37:10.512 --> 37:11.626
Her name is Nadia.

37:15.663 --> 37:16.582
Nadia?

37:17.472 --> 37:18.517
I caught them.

37:19.435 --> 37:21.245
They were leaving They were...

37:23.602 --> 37:24.646
together.

37:35.209 --> 37:37.729
Are you fucking kidding me?

37:38.517 --> 37:39.464
I'm sorry.

37:40.591 --> 37:41.886
He didn't love you.

37:43.807 --> 37:45.339
There's nothing for you here now.

37:50.193 --> 37:50.889
You know what?

37:53.882 --> 37:55.079
I'm not going anywhere.

37:56.318 --> 37:58.531
This is my home now.
Don't be stupid.

37:58.561 --> 38:00.087
Oh yeah? Watch me!

38:01.396 --> 38:02.913
People are getting killed.

38:03.317 --> 38:05.711
You'd risk your life?
Yeah!

38:05.741 --> 38:07.173
To know the truth, yeah.

38:07.872 --> 38:10.810
You're not thinking straight.
Oh, I've never been more clear.

38:10.840 --> 38:14.513
You know that last little shred
of hope that I was hanging on to?

38:14.861 --> 38:16.448
That he did really love me?

38:19.222 --> 38:20.544
That is gone now.

38:22.535 --> 38:24.219
No one fucks me over.

38:25.709 --> 38:26.433
No one.

38:32.672 --> 38:34.134
Is Madame Clios Here?

38:35.164 --> 38:37.280
What's going on?
Madame Clios...

38:37.310 --> 38:40.362
We'd like to take a look in your
vault at the Principality Free Port.

38:41.601 --> 38:44.483
Ok, but you're going
to need a warrant.

38:46.435 --> 38:48.314
This is just a courtesy,
we don't need you there.

38:49.860 --> 38:50.820
Alright, just...

38:52.491 --> 38:53.354
give me a second.

38:54.022 --> 38:55.929
Georgie...
No, it's ok.

39:15.122 --> 39:15.860
What did you say?

39:27.313 --> 39:29.146
It's funny because, um...

39:30.065 --> 39:31.192
I paid for your mother once.

39:32.320 --> 39:34.366
She was good. She was cheap.
Hey, excuse me.

39:34.798 --> 39:36.677
Excuse me, can you
show me the nurse's station?

39:36.707 --> 39:39.228
Hey, could you
show me the nurse's station?

39:40.189 --> 39:41.177
Christos, right?

39:42.361 --> 39:43.516
Do you know where it is?

39:46.317 --> 39:48.809
It's literally over there.
Where? Can you show me?

39:49.547 --> 39:50.104
Please?

39:55.208 --> 39:55.946
Send her my love.

40:04.271 --> 40:06.164
I don't know why you need me to show you.

40:06.628 --> 40:08.716
There! It's got a sign on it.
I don't.

40:10.136 --> 40:11.514
I thought you'd beat up that guy.

40:12.489 --> 40:13.881
Yeah. Well, he deserved it.

40:15.305 --> 40:17.783
I've seen enough punching
and kicking for a lifetime.

40:19.564 --> 40:20.650
i like it here.

40:22.223 --> 40:22.836
Quiet.

41:04.384 --> 41:05.122
Robert...

41:23.463 --> 41:25.245
Anderton, will you do me the honor?

42:10.232 --> 42:10.872
Well?

42:13.768 --> 42:14.505
Anderton!

42:16.273 --> 42:17.248
These are junk.

42:18.017 --> 42:19.006
What do you mean, junk?

42:20.175 --> 42:22.110
They look pretty good.

42:22.917 --> 42:25.604
they're by a local artist. Worthless.

42:26.356 --> 42:28.082
His name's Lucas Carlsson

42:28.881 --> 42:30.635
I happen to think
he's quite talented.

42:37.178 --> 42:37.986
Hod on!

42:49.131 --> 42:50.732
These are bank statements.

42:52.667 --> 42:54.184
your husband's account.

43:11.728 --> 43:13.886
Georgina Clios,
you're under arrest.

43:15.891 --> 43:17.116
Take her out.
No, hang on...

43:17.146 --> 43:19.608
Just hang on a second!
Hold on! Wait.

43:20.666 --> 43:21.543
Get off of me!

43:23.725 --> 43:26.119
Robert! Look at me! Look at...

43:45.171 --> 43:48.846
<i>Was it love? It was wild
Brought me to my knee</i>

43:48.876 --> 43:52.479
