My neighbors are renovating
their apartment...

00:25.525 --> 00:27.459

left his radio on.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.328
Just cut the warden a little
slack, okay, Bones? There was a riot.

00:37.404 --> 00:39.338
The cell doors open
automatically in a fire.

00:39.406 --> 00:42.773
The guards had to subdue the inmates
so the firefighters could do their jobs.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You stay close, okay?

00:46.846 --> 00:49.815

- Why not keep him on death row?
- We don't have one.

01:00.527 --> 01:05.191
He was transferred to Bayview so he'd
be closer to the courthouse for his trial.

01:05.265 --> 01:08.860
<i>Victim is male,
approximately 30 years of age.</i>

01:08.935 --> 01:12.200
He matches Epps's
general size and build.

01:12.272 --> 01:14.797
Contortion indicates
a... painful death.

01:14.874 --> 01:17.434

01:17.510 --> 01:19.444
it's just what the doctor ordered.

01:19.512 --> 01:24.108
It seems as if someone
threw accelerant on him, lit him on fire.

01:24.184 --> 01:27.449
- Hey, look. Any idea who'd want him dead?
- All the inmates hated him.

01:27.520 --> 01:31.547
Once the fire started, it was...
it was chaos. Could've been anyone.

01:31.624 --> 01:33.558
- Booth?
- Yeah?

01:33.626 --> 01:36.186
- This is the wrist I broke.
- So?

01:36.262 --> 01:38.230
So this break is fresh.

01:38.298 --> 01:40.323
So? Bones, they break
in a fire, right?

01:40.400 --> 01:43.426
Yes, but... there's no sign
of a prior break.

01:43.503 --> 01:47.997
This man's wrist was slammed against
a hard edge within the last few hours.

01:48.074 --> 01:52.477
- Whoa. What are you saying?
- [Exhales] This is not Howard Epps.

01:52.545 --> 01:55.981
<i>- That's impossible.
- Okay, look. All your prisoners,
are they accounted for?</i>

01:56.049 --> 01:58.347
- They are if this is Epps.
- What about the guards?

01:58.418 --> 02:01.012
- They've all reported in.
- Whoa.

02:01.087 --> 02:05.888

02:08.261 --> 02:10.252
He was a firefighter.

02:10.330 --> 02:13.299
So you're saying that the fireman
comes in to save Epps.

02:13.366 --> 02:16.699
But Epps kills him,
takes his uniform, sets him on fire.

02:16.769 --> 02:19.329
- And walks right out the front door.
- Son of a bitch.

02:19.405 --> 02:22.033
- Lock this place down now.
- I want this whole block locked down!

02:22.108 --> 02:25.908

- Did you really call me

- Yeah.

03:19.499 --> 03:21.467
It was before you called me short.

03:21.534 --> 03:25.334
Hey, Zack called you short.
I think you're just the right height.

03:25.405 --> 03:28.340

<i>Fractures are consistent

03:49.162 --> 03:52.154
The victim's wrist was broken
to match Epps's injury.

03:52.232 --> 03:56.100
A blow to the head rendered him unconscious.
He was then set on fire.

03:56.169 --> 03:59.366
- If there was ever anyone who should be in Gitmo...
- I agree.

03:59.439 --> 04:01.498
But he's not. He's out.

04:01.574 --> 04:05.305
And that means more victims
unless we stop him first, which we will do.

04:05.378 --> 04:08.541
Or there'll be another article written about us
that won't be so kind. Where's Dr. Brennan?

Ex-wife. The judge signed
my divorce papers last month.

04:25.632 --> 04:28.328
<i>Why didn't it work out, exactly?

04:28.401 --> 04:30.335

04:30.403 --> 04:34.863
I thought I could help Howard.
But he used me.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.375
I haven't had any contact

<i>I'd like to place you

04:56.462 --> 05:00.489
I have a new life

05:00.566 --> 05:04.468
Raymond's a good man.
If he found out...

05:04.537 --> 05:07.267
We all have secrets
in our past, Mrs. Epps.

05:07.340 --> 05:10.832
Admittedly not as bizarre as yours.

05:10.910 --> 05:12.878
But you shouldn't risk your life...

05:12.945 --> 05:15.846
just because you're embarrassed
to tell your boyfriend the truth.

05:15.915 --> 05:19.612
Howard's interest
is in young blonde girls.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.620
I'm not even his type.

<i>What... You can't let her go.

05:30.530 --> 05:32.555
Well, I can't force her
to take protection, all right?

05:32.632 --> 05:36.898
I'll have the local police drive by her house
every couple of hours and make sure she's safe.

05:36.969 --> 05:38.903
And you know what?
You're not safe either.

05:38.971 --> 05:42.372
But I'm not unhinged.
I can take care of myself.

05:42.442 --> 05:44.569
You and Epps... Okay, it's personal.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.737
You're everything that he hates.

05:46.813 --> 05:49.043
And what is that exactly?

05:49.115 --> 05:53.415
Well, you know, you're a smart,
strong, confident woman.

05:53.486 --> 05:57.115
<i>And, uh, figured him out.
You made him feel powerless.</i>

05:57.190 --> 06:02.150
So he's gonna want to, uh, prove that, uh,
you're weak and inferior.

06:02.228 --> 06:07.996
So, you are not to go out
on your own, ever.

06:11.270 --> 06:13.830
- Hi.
- Hey. Did the wife give you anything?

06:13.906 --> 06:16.932
Oh, chills. Look, I need you to double
security here at the lab.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.670
You think Epps is gonna come
after Brennan?

06:18.745 --> 06:21.270
I can't rule anything out
when it comes to Epps.

06:21.347 --> 06:23.508
I'll take care of it.

06:23.583 --> 06:26.074
Look, l-I don't want you
to be alone either.

06:26.152 --> 06:28.848
Are you inviting me over?

06:28.921 --> 06:33.483
I'm just thinking that everyone
should just stay here at the lab.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.857
Leave it to a serial killer
to spoil the mood.

06:35.928 --> 06:40.695
Whatever security you think is enough,
you double it, Camille.

06:50.843 --> 06:53.277
I'm glad you're on my side, Seeley.

07:10.196 --> 07:15.725
[Angela] The burn victim is Donald Kent,
a decorated firefighter.

07:15.802 --> 07:20.171
- Epps would appreciate the irony.
- You know Kent was still alive
when he was set on fire?

07:20.239 --> 07:23.106
How many victims does that make?

07:23.176 --> 07:25.201
Seven, that we know of.

07:26.846 --> 07:29.371
And they aren't just
young blonde women anymore.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.383
No, they aren't.

07:31.451 --> 07:36.150
He's such a monster.
He's killed from behind bars.

07:36.222 --> 07:39.714
And new victims keep turning up.
And now he's out.

07:39.792 --> 07:44.024
We will find him, Ange.
We're ready this time.

07:44.096 --> 07:49.227
I'm not. Look, I have
some sick days coming.

07:50.603 --> 07:53.572
And I was thinking that
since Epps makes me sick, that...

07:53.639 --> 07:58.099
We need you, Ange.
Hodgins certainly does.

07:58.177 --> 08:01.408
- That was low.
- I know.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.415
Did it work?

08:06.819 --> 08:09.219
How do you deal with the fear?

08:09.288 --> 08:13.054
I... have this.

08:16.696 --> 08:20.564
Oh, my God.
That... That thing is huge.

08:20.633 --> 08:24.091
- Wow. That's, like, movie huge.
- Where the hell did you get that?

08:24.170 --> 08:26.604
- The mall.
- The mall?

08:26.672 --> 08:29.106
Yeah. It's pretty big, right?
Bigger than the one you have.

08:29.175 --> 08:32.405
<i>Excuse me. It's not the size that matters.
It's how you use it.</i>

08:32.477 --> 08:34.775
Well, I think size
is pretty important.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.941
The point is that you shouldn't
have a gun in the first place.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.884
If you do have one,
bigger is always better.

08:40.953 --> 08:44.285
- You're not helping.
- Right, yeah. This does seem
like a private conversation.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.292
<i>Yeah, private. Okay. You know,
people see you with that...</i>

08:47.360 --> 08:49.988

- Means to an end.

09:17.890 --> 09:21.826
Everything is a means
to an end, Dr. Brennan.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.954
I thought it was just women
you were after.

09:25.031 --> 09:28.432
I felt the need to grow

09:41.847 --> 09:45.806

09:45.885 --> 09:48.115
I can't answer all your questions.

09:49.221 --> 09:51.155
Use your head, Dr. Brennan.

09:52.558 --> 09:54.492
Use your head.

09:59.365 --> 10:02.198

Booth, Epps left us something.

10:22.021 --> 10:24.251

10:26.392 --> 10:28.223
It's bone.

10:28.294 --> 10:32.060
Shaved down by a rough sandpaper.
Hodgins found mica grit.

10:32.131 --> 10:35.692
Tell you this.
If Epps comes near Angela, I'll kill him.

10:35.768 --> 10:39.932
- What about the rest of us?
- Everyone will be fine. Cam increased security.

10:40.006 --> 10:42.998
And you have the big gun.

10:43.075 --> 10:45.134

<i>- Spices?
- Yeah.</i>

11:15.474 --> 11:18.534
The bone wasn't cooked.
Why would he add spices to it?

11:18.611 --> 11:22.775
Epps likes puzzles.
The spices are a message.

11:22.848 --> 11:26.375

11:26.452 --> 11:29.478

- What?

12:12.364 --> 12:16.494
He told me whatever happened
would be my fault.

12:36.355 --> 12:38.482
Package was delivered
by a bike messenger.

12:38.557 --> 12:42.357
He said a man matching Howard Epps's description
approached him on L Street.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.124
- Paid cash.
- He's just playing with us.

12:45.197 --> 12:47.188
Not for long.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.733
<i>- How's Angela?
- Angry.</i>

12:48.801 --> 12:51.395
She insisted on helping me,
which worked out well.

12:51.470 --> 12:53.961
She realized
that the present Epps gave us was a recipe.

12:54.039 --> 12:56.633
- Wait, the heart?
- No, the ingredients in the vial.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.973
After he ground up the bone,
Epps mixed it with spices...

12:59.044 --> 13:02.480
<i>the cardamom, tamarind and kokum...
which are all used in making curries.</i>

13:02.548 --> 13:04.812
- Indian food.
- Epps's wife.

13:04.884 --> 13:09.048
The last address we had for her
was in Little India over a curry restaurant.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.282
Come on.

13:19.331 --> 13:22.095
You know, I could have
the Bureau pull your license.

13:22.168 --> 13:26.264
Yeah, and I could assign Zack
as your forensic anthropologist.

13:30.442 --> 13:33.104
Place hasn't been rented
since she moved.

13:33.179 --> 13:35.374
<i>You know, it's just not logical.</i>

13:35.447 --> 13:37.506
Playing games with us?

13:37.583 --> 13:40.211
<i>It's just gonna lead us
right to him.</i>

13:46.792 --> 13:50.091

13:51.297 --> 13:53.959
Wait.

13:54.033 --> 13:56.934
If the lights are off,
then why is the refrigerator working?

13:59.004 --> 14:01.268
Wai... Just stand back.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.433
[Exhales]

14:03.509 --> 14:05.875
Well, it's not booby-trapped.

14:22.361 --> 14:26.127
The neck was severed
just above the shoulders.

14:26.198 --> 14:32.034
The jagged marks on the bone indicate that
Epps used some kind of saw to decapitate her.

14:32.104 --> 14:35.631
<i>No sign ofblunt force trauma
to the skull... Epps's usual M.O.</i>

14:35.708 --> 14:38.802
- No clear cause of death.
- Without the rest of her body...

14:38.878 --> 14:42.644
we can't know for sure
how... she died.

14:42.715 --> 14:46.242
I'm seeing...
some kind of white powder in her hair.

14:46.318 --> 14:49.515
Hodgins can tell us what it is.

14:49.588 --> 14:51.647
Why just leave her head?

14:51.724 --> 14:54.420
To get us all involved.

14:54.493 --> 14:59.021
I mean, the less we have to work with, the...
the more we're all drawn in.

14:59.098 --> 15:03.330
- Epps told me to use my head.
- Everything he says is a clue.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.802
- Could it be inside the head?
- It's too early to tell.

15:05.871 --> 15:08.101
What do you mean, too early? Okay?

15:08.173 --> 15:11.199
All we do is just cut open the damn head
and find out what's inside.

15:11.277 --> 15:13.939
But there are protocols, Booth.

15:14.013 --> 15:16.311
Yeah, and I'm sure Epps
is really concerned about the protocols.

15:16.382 --> 15:18.612
This is my autopsy.
We're gonna do it by the book.

15:18.684 --> 15:21.244
That means surface exam
followed by X-rays...

15:21.320 --> 15:23.379
after which I will open the skull.

15:23.455 --> 15:26.549
Sorry. I'm just anxious to get the little gerbil
back in his cage. That's all.

15:27.726 --> 15:30.661
<i>Okay.
That's terrifically disturbing.</i>

15:30.729 --> 15:34.563
- What?
- Massive blood aspiration
to the soft tissue of the neck.

15:34.633 --> 15:36.897
- [Exhales]
- Meaning?

15:36.969 --> 15:40.461
Caroline Epps was alive
when Howard cut her head off.

15:42.241 --> 15:44.675
Now he's torturing his victims.

15:45.878 --> 15:48.870
- So let's torture him.
- How?

15:48.948 --> 15:52.008
- Bring his mother in.
- I thought Epps hated his mother.

15:52.084 --> 15:54.814
His F.B.I. profiler believes he was
emotionally attached to her.

15:54.887 --> 15:57.321
His prison logs show
that he wrote to her almost every day.

15:57.389 --> 15:59.721
- Well, that's sick.
- But helpful.

15:59.792 --> 16:04.559
I mean, if he feels responsible
for his mother being in jail...

16:04.630 --> 16:06.598
we can knock him off his game.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.662
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

16:14.873 --> 16:16.807
- [Whispers] What's that smell?
- It's mold.

16:16.875 --> 16:18.934
It grows in the fat creases
of morbidly obese people.

16:19.011 --> 16:20.945
What is this about?

16:21.013 --> 16:24.005
Did you bring me here
to make fun of me?

16:24.083 --> 16:27.348
I merely stated a fact, Mrs. Epps.
You need to lose weight.

16:27.419 --> 16:31.685
Obesity also causes diabetes,
heart damage, liver failure.

16:31.757 --> 16:35.022
Not to mention the wear
it puts on your joints.

16:35.094 --> 16:38.086
I have a glandular condition.

16:38.163 --> 16:42.532
A little compassion and understanding,
that's what I really need.

16:42.601 --> 16:46.628
- Why am I here?
- We, uh... We found some drugs at your place.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.074
<i>Those are my pills.</i>

16:50.142 --> 16:52.303
My doctor gave them to me.
I need my medicine.

16:52.378 --> 16:54.403
Well, you know,
they're not, uh, properly labeled.

16:54.480 --> 16:57.779
This could take us a few days
to sort this out with your doctor.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.943
We're looking for Howard, Mrs. Epps.

17:00.019 --> 17:04.547
Howard's in jail. I haven't seen him
or talked to him in years.

17:04.623 --> 17:07.558
Howard, uh, escaped yesterday.

17:07.626 --> 17:10.185
Oh, dear Lord.

17:10.262 --> 17:12.320
I tried to raise a good son.

17:12.397 --> 17:15.992
Tried to keep him pure
like the good book says.

17:16.068 --> 17:19.060
l-I don't know what happened.

17:19.137 --> 17:21.071
He was such a sweet child.

17:21.140 --> 17:23.574
Howard... He wrote to you
all the time.

17:23.642 --> 17:28.944
He wants me to understand,
wants me to forgive him.

17:29.014 --> 17:31.244
Says he's still my little boy.

17:31.316 --> 17:35.753
[Inhales]
But I don't answer.

17:35.821 --> 17:40.281
Your son murdered his wife yesterday,
beheaded her.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.088
And you want to blame me?

17:46.165 --> 17:49.259
You made your son bathe in ammonia.

17:49.334 --> 17:51.495
The women he would go out with,
they were loose.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.368
Not the right kind
for a God-fearing son.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.637
Wanted him to wash their scent off.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.643
Is there anything else
that you can tell us...

17:59.711 --> 18:02.009
that might help us find your son
before he kills again?

18:02.081 --> 18:04.811
<i>- It's not my fault what he did.
- [Booth] Yeah.</i>

18:04.883 --> 18:07.078
Okay. Um, that's all for now.

18:07.152 --> 18:10.952
We'll have an agent
escort you back to your cell.

18:11.023 --> 18:13.457
Um, of course you have
the right to an attorney.

18:13.525 --> 18:17.359
I should've been harder on him,
beat him more regular.

18:17.429 --> 18:22.298
<i>I'm a nice person. Too nice.
That was my problem.</i>

18:22.367 --> 18:24.665
Too nice.

18:24.736 --> 18:26.795
Marian Epps is clearly a bad mother.

18:26.872 --> 18:28.806
[Chuckles]
You think?

18:28.874 --> 18:32.332
But a lot of people have bad mothers
and they don't grow up to be serial killers...

18:32.411 --> 18:34.572
which is why I don't put much
stock in psychology.

18:34.646 --> 18:36.580
Bones, I don't care how you
explain it, all right?

18:36.648 --> 18:38.513
The guy, he's an animal.
He's got no conscience.

18:38.584 --> 18:41.553
I don't know how one
draws moral distinctions between killers.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.781
Listen, Bones. There are
crimes of passion, all right?

18:43.856 --> 18:45.790
Crimes committed
out of desperation...

18:45.858 --> 18:48.918
which are usually followed by remorse
or acknowledgement of human failing.

18:48.994 --> 18:50.928
The key word here is "human."

18:50.996 --> 18:54.864
The reasons for killing someone
are unimportant. It...

18:54.933 --> 18:57.265
The life that's taken
is all that matters.

18:57.336 --> 18:59.896
- Listen, you can't blame yourself here.
- It's me he's after.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.338
Angela and everyone else,
they shouldn't be involved.

19:02.407 --> 19:04.875
All right. Look.
It's not your fault, all right? It's all Epps.

19:04.943 --> 19:08.401
- Which is why I'm gonna take
this little bastard down.
- Booth.

19:09.581 --> 19:11.515

19:11.583 --> 19:13.881
Mm-hmm. That's right.

- If it were a gas, I'd be in the hospital with Cam.

24:48.954 --> 24:51.946
No particles on her clothing.
Zack, it had to be a gas.

24:52.023 --> 24:55.049
- It wasn't. Are we having an argument?
- Of course.

24:55.126 --> 24:57.560
- Why?
- Because Cam's dying, and I should be with Angela.

24:57.629 --> 24:59.563
And because there are no particles.

24:59.631 --> 25:01.565
- On the clothing?
- That's right.

25:01.633 --> 25:03.726
What about in the glass parts
still left in the head?

25:06.104 --> 25:08.834
I'm not angry at you anymore.

25:12.677 --> 25:15.145
<i>- [Monitor: Rhythmic Beeping]
- Hey.</i>

25:15.213 --> 25:17.272
- [Chuckles]
- [Wheezes]

25:19.017 --> 25:20.951
Welcome back.

25:21.019 --> 25:24.147
[Gulps]
Why can't I breathe?

25:24.222 --> 25:27.248
Your saw, it, um...

25:27.325 --> 25:30.192
it hit some kind of poison but, uh...

25:30.262 --> 25:32.230
you're gonna be all right.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.666
Zack?

25:35.734 --> 25:40.228
He's fine. Okay?
Everyone... Everyone's good.

25:42.474 --> 25:44.465
I'm-I'm...

25:46.044 --> 25:50.003
I'm so sorry, you know, that I put so much
pressure on you to hurry.

25:50.081 --> 25:55.212
- I didn't, uh...
- [Wheezes] Not your fault.

25:55.287 --> 25:58.518
Epps did this to me.

26:00.592 --> 26:03.152
[Sniffles]
Hey.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.162
Your family's coming.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.824
Oh, God.
[Coughs]

26:10.669 --> 26:14.765
And I thought poison...
was my biggest problem.

26:14.839 --> 26:17.865
[Chuckles, Sniffles]

26:17.943 --> 26:20.810
[Chuckles]

26:21.212 --> 26:24.511
<i>You look exhausted.</i>

26:24.583 --> 26:26.608
[Exhales]
What have you got?

26:30.155 --> 26:32.623
- [Typing]
- Okay.

26:32.691 --> 26:36.388
<i>This is an X-ray of Caroline's head.</i>

26:36.461 --> 26:39.862
<i>These are shards of glass,
very fragile.</i>

26:39.931 --> 26:45.892
- What was it?
- I think it was a glass capsule
filled with a poisonous powder.

26:45.971 --> 26:48.531
Epps inserted it after she was dead.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.700
<i>Probably up the nose.</i>

26:50.775 --> 26:53.710
And when the saw blade hit it,
it exploded.

26:53.778 --> 26:55.712
Hodgins has some of the shards now.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.714
He'll figure out what the poison is.

26:57.782 --> 26:59.716
If I were Epps,
I would've made it something...

26:59.784 --> 27:02.548
that changes composition
after prolonged exposure to air.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.987
Let's hope he's not as smart as you.

27:06.424 --> 27:08.688
I'm gonna go sit with Cam
for a while.

27:24.442 --> 27:26.842
- [Ringing]
- Brennan.

27:26.911 --> 27:30.347
- So who'd I get?
- [Whispers] Epps.

27:32.617 --> 27:38.453
If you're talking about the bulb
in Caroline's head, we removed it.

27:38.523 --> 27:40.457
How'd you get it in there
without breaking it?

27:40.525 --> 27:44.621
I saw the emergency vehicles.
I know I got someone.

27:44.696 --> 27:48.496
They might not be dead yet,
but they will be soon.

27:48.566 --> 27:50.796
Sorry. You missed this time.

27:50.869 --> 27:53.667
If you don't admit to who it was...

27:53.738 --> 27:56.639
then I can't give you
the hint to save their life.

27:58.443 --> 28:01.935
- Okay, then. It was nice talking to you.
- Wait!

28:02.013 --> 28:04.413
- Wait!
- Yes, Dr. Brennan?

28:06.785 --> 28:08.719
Dr. Saroyan.

28:08.787 --> 28:13.190
She tried to remove the bulb
with forceps.

28:13.258 --> 28:16.386
But it was too fragile. It snapped.

28:16.461 --> 28:18.986
Yes. That's exactly what happened.

28:19.064 --> 28:21.396
Now will you tell me the poison?

28:21.466 --> 28:24.492
The body knows
what the head can't say.

28:24.569 --> 28:27.970
Caroline's body
or your mother's body?

28:28.039 --> 28:31.998
- My mother?
- Yes. We have her in custody. Didn't you know?

28:33.144 --> 28:37.274
- On what charges?
- What poison, Howard?

28:46.357 --> 28:49.690
You had no right.
My mother's not part of this.

28:49.761 --> 28:53.288
You tell me about the poison,
and I will tell you about your mother.

28:57.569 --> 29:01.801
You don't run the game.
I run the game.

29:01.873 --> 29:04.603
You're gonna be sorry.

29:06.144 --> 29:08.612
Cell phone downtown.
There's a team on its way.

29:08.680 --> 29:11.046
He's already gone.

29:13.084 --> 29:16.781
<i>- [Respirator Hissing]
- [Monitor: Rhythmic Beeping]</i>

29:24.729 --> 29:27.027
Hey, Hodgins find the poison?

29:27.098 --> 29:29.066
Not yet.

29:30.802 --> 29:33.532
How's Cam?

29:33.605 --> 29:37.507
It's worse.
She can't breathe on her own. They...

29:37.575 --> 29:42.512
<i>Uh... Bones, I really need you
to find out what she inhaled.</i>

29:42.580 --> 29:45.481
Epps called and... left me a clue.

29:45.550 --> 29:49.418
- What is it?
- He said, " The body knows
what the head can't say."

29:49.487 --> 29:52.422
- Caroline's body.
- I think so. Yes.

29:52.490 --> 29:57.393
<i>You were right. He was pretty upset
when he found out that we had his mother.</i>

29:57.462 --> 30:00.226
You told him? That's good.

30:00.298 --> 30:04.496
- Make the bastard sweat.
- He said we'd be sorry.

30:04.569 --> 30:08.972
<i>[Beeping, Hissing Continue]</i>

30:09.040 --> 30:11.838
I'll call you as soon as we have
something to go on.

30:11.910 --> 30:16.540
<i>Bones, I'm coming with you,
all right?</i>

30:16.614 --> 30:18.741
Hold on, all right?
This is gonna take all of us.

30:39.337 --> 30:42.397
Okay, I'll drive.

30:42.607 --> 30:46.099
If I put too small a sample
into the photoelectric aerosol sensor...

30:46.177 --> 30:48.611
then I'll both lose the sample
and not get an accurate response.

30:50.114 --> 30:53.174
I estimate that there's about 1/10,000th
of a gram on this shard.

30:53.251 --> 30:55.185
[Exhales]
We're not getting enough.

30:55.253 --> 30:57.847
Not to mention the particles
themselves are extremely small...

30:57.922 --> 31:00.516
about 1.6 micrometers in diameter.

31:00.592 --> 31:03.254
- Hey. What's the poison?
- I don't know yet.

31:03.328 --> 31:05.728
- Well, what-what do you know?
- It's none of the common poisons:

31:05.797 --> 31:07.924
arsenic, cyanide, mercuric chloride.

31:07.999 --> 31:10.490
Let's start by telling the hospital
what it isn't then, okay?

31:10.568 --> 31:12.934
<i>- What was in Caroline Epps's hair?
- The white powder?</i>

31:13.004 --> 31:14.938
It was just common plaster dust.

31:15.006 --> 31:19.102
<i>There was also a very small
amount of sodium hydrosulfide in her ear.</i>

31:19.177 --> 31:23.011
- Great. Put those two things
together, what do we have?
- Drywalling and...

31:23.081 --> 31:25.675
[Stammering]
Uh, leather goods?

31:25.750 --> 31:28.776
Great. I'll look through the evidence
and see if I can find those two things.

31:28.853 --> 31:30.115
<i>- [Hodgins] Booth.
- What?</i>

31:30.188 --> 31:32.748
I'm sorry, man.
Without more material, it's just...

31:32.824 --> 31:34.815
No, it's...
You're both doing a great job.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.418
Now it's now up to me to find
Caroline Epps's body.

31:37.495 --> 31:39.690
<i>- [Zack] Booth?
- What?</i>

31:39.764 --> 31:42.198
We've endowed Epps
with intelligence he does not have.

31:42.267 --> 31:45.862
<i>- His clues are unsophisticated word games.
- Yeah?</i>

31:45.937 --> 31:49.703
Uh, " My name is Parker. Ask me
how I can solve this case."

31:49.774 --> 31:51.674
I already asked Parker.
He doesn't know anything.

31:51.743 --> 31:54.541
It doesn't have to be your son.
It can be something else named Parker.

31:54.612 --> 31:57.775
Something to do with leather goods
or drywall. Do a Boolean search.

31:59.450 --> 32:01.941
Okay, right.
You don't know what that is. Boolean is...

32:04.422 --> 32:06.356
I won't explain. I'll just do it.

32:06.424 --> 32:08.358
I am walking out of here.

32:08.426 --> 32:11.452
You try and stop me again,
I will shoot both of you.

32:13.598 --> 32:18.661
Mmm.
[Whimpering]

32:18.736 --> 32:22.502
- What?
- I really need him to come back.

32:23.741 --> 32:25.675
Booth!

32:25.743 --> 32:27.904
Whatever you got
better be worth dying for.

32:34.619 --> 32:39.386
Uh, there's a Parker & Parker Leather Goods
owned by the Parker brothers...

32:39.457 --> 32:42.483
on Parker Street in the town of Parker
just outside of Arlington.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.858
- That's a lot of Parkers.
- Yeah, okay. Let's go.

32:44.929 --> 32:48.023
Grab your boss
and let's get going. Come on.

32:50.635 --> 32:53.263
<i>[Man]
All right. Let's fan out.</i>

32:54.739 --> 32:56.570
<i>- Clear!
- [Man #2] Go, Sean.</i>

32:56.641 --> 32:58.575
<i>[Man #3]
Check that door. Check that door.</i>

32:58.643 --> 33:00.235
<i>[Man #4]
We're clear.</i>

33:00.311 --> 33:02.302
Okay. Uh... Come on.

33:02.380 --> 33:04.371
Knowing Epps, how do we know
that's Caroline's body there?

33:04.449 --> 33:07.577
- If it isn't, it'll still be a clue.
- Okay, let me do this, all right?

33:07.652 --> 33:10.917
All right. No, uh...

33:10.989 --> 33:13.116
- Jam all the frequencies.
- [Radio Squawks]

33:13.191 --> 33:16.217
If he's got a remote detonator,
it ain't gonna work now.

33:16.294 --> 33:18.262
<i>- No sign of trip wires.
- There it is.</i>

33:18.329 --> 33:20.263
<i>[Man]
I'll radio it in.</i>

33:20.331 --> 33:23.357
<i>- [Brennan]
On her stomach, the poison, just like Epps said.
- I'll just...</i>

33:23.434 --> 33:25.698
- No, Zack! No! Don't hesitate!
- [Switch Clicks, Beeping]

33:25.770 --> 33:28.238
<i>- Put your palm on the stomach and press down.
- [Switch Clicks]</i>

33:28.306 --> 33:30.797
- What?
- That was a pressure trigger.

33:30.875 --> 33:33.537
<i>- Body's booby trapped. Everybody out!
- [Man] Roger that. Let's go.</i>

33:34.979 --> 33:36.913
<i>- Go, go, go, go!
- What do I do?</i>

33:36.981 --> 33:39.711
- Don't be scared.
- I'm not scared. I just need to know what to do.

33:39.784 --> 33:41.718
- Out. Out.
- I want to help.

33:41.786 --> 33:43.777
Out! Now.

33:46.657 --> 33:49.683
[Exhales]
Zack, uh...

33:51.362 --> 33:53.296
This, uh...

33:53.364 --> 33:56.060
- This is gonna hurt.
- You or me?

33:56.134 --> 33:59.661
Mostly you. Okay. On three, I want you
to jump back as high as you can.

33:59.737 --> 34:02.171
- I'm not a good jumper.
- Be a good counter.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.174
- l-I am a good counter.
- Right.

34:04.242 --> 34:06.574
- On three.
- Okay.

34:06.644 --> 34:09.806
[Together]
One, two, three!

34:18.989 --> 34:22.187
The explosion occurred
as F.B.I. agents searched the shop...

34:22.260 --> 34:24.387
for escaped serial killer
Howard Epps.

34:24.462 --> 34:26.953
At least one person
was killed in the blast.

34:27.031 --> 34:29.295
Dr. Zack Addy,
a forensic anthropologist...

34:29.367 --> 34:32.130
who was working with the F.B.I.,
died at the scene.

34:32.203 --> 34:35.831
Special Agent Seeley Booth
remains in critical condition.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.841
[Chuckles]
Okay, that's creepy.

34:37.909 --> 34:41.606
<i>- Zack dead and me in critical condition, right?
- But why? It's not true.</i>

34:41.679 --> 34:43.737
<i>- Let's just hope Epps buys it.
- [TVClicks Off]</i>

34:44.916 --> 34:46.850
You gonna be all right?

34:46.918 --> 34:49.351
My doctor said most of my injuries
didn't come from the explosion...

34:49.420 --> 34:51.513
but from being slammed
into the floor.

34:51.589 --> 34:53.784
Apparently you're extremely strong.

34:53.858 --> 34:55.655
Did you have to be so rough on him?

34:55.726 --> 34:58.388
It was a bomb.
I was being, you know, heroic.

34:58.463 --> 35:00.897
- I was heroic too.
- Yes, you were.

35:00.965 --> 35:03.490
Somebody saved somebody.
That's all I'm saying.

35:03.568 --> 35:05.729
- Well, I got the poison.
- Which is good...

35:05.803 --> 35:07.737
because Caroline's body
was blown to pieces.

35:07.805 --> 35:11.070
That was good thinking,
you know, you keeping your wits.

35:12.243 --> 35:14.177
But I mean, what I did was, uh...

35:17.181 --> 35:21.345
I guess if you have to explain to yourself
why you're a hero, you're not really a hero.

35:23.054 --> 35:25.989
What the hell are you?

35:26.057 --> 35:29.754
You're not a bacterial protein
or a non-opioid analgesic.

35:29.827 --> 35:32.159
You're not a neurotoxin
or a heavy metal.

35:32.230 --> 35:34.164
You act like chloromethane,
but Zack said...

35:34.232 --> 35:36.462
that there was no sweet smell
when the powder was released.

35:37.935 --> 35:40.028
Are you talking to the evidence?

35:40.104 --> 35:43.870
Just... working through this
as systematically as possible.

35:43.941 --> 35:47.240
You know, when this whole thing is over,
I am moving to a doorman building...

35:47.311 --> 35:50.610
I'm getting an unlisted number and I am
hiring a full-time bodyguard named Knuckles.

35:50.681 --> 35:56.085
- Don't get paranoid.
- That's funny coming from a conspiracy theorist.

35:56.154 --> 35:59.055
<i>- [Beeping]
- [Hodgins] Of course! Methyl bromide.</i>

35:59.123 --> 36:01.114
I'll call the hospital.

36:02.927 --> 36:05.054
Methyl bromide
mixed with plaster dust.

36:05.129 --> 36:07.063
That's what made it
so hard to isolate.

36:07.131 --> 36:09.759
- What's the treatment?
- Racemic epinephrine. I called the hospital.

36:09.834 --> 36:12.064
- They're starting an I.V.
- Shouldn't you be there for that?

36:12.136 --> 36:15.503
Priorities, man. One, be there when someone
you love comes back from the brink of death.

36:15.573 --> 36:18.599
Two, catch the serial killer.
Everything after that is basically unimportant.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.701
I'm gonna go see Cam
at the hospital.

36:20.778 --> 36:23.804
- And you are gonna go home and get some sleep.
- Why can't I go home?

36:23.881 --> 36:27.817
- Didn't you just hear what they
said on the news? You're dead.
- What about Epps?

36:27.885 --> 36:30.786
I got an entire surveillance team
outside your house, watching you.

36:30.855 --> 36:34.222
Why does everybody
question me, right? I'm the hero.

36:37.061 --> 36:40.326
- Why is it taking so long?
- It's not.

36:40.398 --> 36:42.332
She's responding.

36:48.339 --> 36:52.105
- Camille?
- Seeley.

36:52.176 --> 36:56.112
[Chuckles]
Don't call me Seeley.

36:56.180 --> 36:59.115
Don't call me Camille.

36:59.183 --> 37:01.743
How you feeling, babe?

37:01.819 --> 37:07.280
Like I got poisoned by a disembodied head
full of plaster dust.

37:08.593 --> 37:10.527
Plaster dust.

37:12.463 --> 37:15.296
[Softly]
Plaster dust.

37:18.169 --> 37:22.538
Everything is secure.
Agent Holtz will stay in the hallway...

37:22.607 --> 37:24.768
and there'll be
another agent in the lobby.

37:24.842 --> 37:27.470
Thank you. Good night.

37:27.545 --> 37:29.604
Good night.

Check the apartment next door.

<i>[Hammer Cocks]</i>

38:29.473 --> 38:31.873
<i>- [Hammer Cocks]

38:31.942 --> 38:34.433
<i>You won't let me shoot him,
will you?</i>

38:34.512 --> 38:36.673
<i>You knew he was
gonna be here, didn't you?</i>

38:36.747 --> 38:39.272
It's the only scenario
that made sense.

38:39.350 --> 38:42.808
<i>Oh. What, you heading
for the balcony, Howie?</i>

38:42.887 --> 38:46.721
- Hope you can fly, 'cause that's
about a 50-foot drop, right?
- Yeah.

38:46.791 --> 38:49.385
- How did you know?
- Plaster dust in the poison.

38:49.460 --> 38:51.928
Renovations
to the apartment next door.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.556
You're not all that smart,
turns out.

38:54.632 --> 38:59.194
One minute. All I want
is one minute alone with you.

38:59.270 --> 39:02.000
- Fine with me.
- Don't provoke the lunatic, all right?

39:02.073 --> 39:05.702
- You got nowhere to go.
- I'm not going back to jail.

39:05.776 --> 39:08.404
You see, that's really
not your decision, Howie.

39:08.479 --> 39:10.538
Get your hands up.

39:12.983 --> 39:16.043
Drop the crowbar.

39:18.522 --> 39:20.888
<i>- [Crowbar Clatters]
- In the line of fire, Bones.</i>

39:23.728 --> 39:25.593
You're not getting away, Howard.

39:27.198 --> 39:30.258
[Panting]
Look who the killer is now, Agent Booth.

39:30.334 --> 39:33.394
A little help here, Bones?
I got nothing but dead weight here.

39:33.471 --> 39:36.167
- Help me.
- Sorry.

39:36.240 --> 39:38.231
- [Grunts]
- Can't reach.

39:38.309 --> 39:41.801
- Grab the railing.
- You're gonna drop me anyway.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.904
Just get it over with.

39:43.981 --> 39:45.972
You son of a bitch.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.644
Are you saying
you don't want me dead?

39:48.719 --> 39:50.653
Yeah, I'm not you.

39:50.721 --> 39:55.624
Oh, really? You're not
thinking of the world with me still in it?

39:55.693 --> 40:00.357
- Going after Dr. Brennan, your son...
- I'm not you.

40:00.431 --> 40:02.365
[Booth, Brennan Grunting]

40:29.493 --> 40:31.859
So did the sniper across the street.

40:31.929 --> 40:34.227
- You tried to save him.
- Yep.

40:34.298 --> 40:36.232
No one could've helped him.

40:37.301 --> 40:39.496
Yeah.

40:39.570 --> 40:41.504
You can to take off now, Booth.

40:41.572 --> 40:46.305
Department might want to assign you
a shrink... on-the-job death like that.

40:49.413 --> 40:52.405
You didn't have your full strength.

40:52.483 --> 40:55.316
Your wrist was hurt from pulling Zack
away from the explosion.

40:55.386 --> 40:57.684
My wrist wasn't hurt, Bones.

40:57.755 --> 41:02.089
- [Scoffs] I wish you'd let me shoot him.
- No, you don't.

41:12.242 --> 41:13.542
Parker, I'll put you up again.

41:13.542 --> 41:17.542
No, Daddy, I don't wanna get up.

41:31.642 --> 41:35.642
Knuckles!

41:38.142 --> 41:38.642
Hi.

41:38.642 --> 41:40.042
How'd you know I was here?

41:40.042 --> 41:41.742
Saturday morning.

41:41.742 --> 41:42.842
How's Parker?

41:42.842 --> 41:45.042
Yeah, I'm afraid I freaked him out.

41:45.042 --> 41:46.942
Today he's really scared of this place.

41:46.942 --> 41:50.342
I gotta put that right.

41:50.342 --> 41:54.342
It's you all over. Putting things right.

41:58.742 --> 42:02.742
Cam gets released from hospital today?

42:04.042 --> 42:07.542
Yeah.

42:07.542 --> 42:08.942
What?

42:08.942 --> 42:11.742
You know, what happened
to Cam happened because

42:11.742 --> 42:14.742
we had a personal relationship.

42:14.742 --> 42:15.942
Had?

42:15.942 --> 42:18.842
People who work in
high-risk situations,

42:18.842 --> 42:21.242
they can't be involved romantically

42:21.242 --> 42:25.242
because it
leads to--

42:25.442 --> 42:28.342
things like what happened.

42:28.342 --> 42:30.242
High-risk situations.

42:30.242 --> 42:32.642
Every single day, it's with us.

42:32.642 --> 42:36.642
There's this line and we can't
cross it, you know what I'm saying?

42:38.342 --> 42:41.642
Yes.

42:41.642 --> 42:45.642
I understand.

42:49.942 --> 42:51.942
He seems OK now.

42:51.942 --> 42:55.942
Yeah. It's important
to make things right.

42:58.342 --> 43:00.542
I just don't know how.

43:00.542 --> 43:04.542
I don't know how.
