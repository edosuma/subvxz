- I'm sorry. Go into what with you?

gonna talk to Oliver.

if he knew the truth.

The man's under the FBI microscope,
he's worried about his son.

Imagine how worried he would be if he
knew you were out there compromised.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.259
Hey.

21:53.437 --> 21:55.394
Wow... Just surprised
to see you here.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.598
And also surprised
that you remember the access code.

21:57.691 --> 21:58.852
It's been like a week.

21:58.943 --> 22:00.354
Yeah, it was a joke.

22:00.611 --> 22:02.568
- Okay.
- I'm guessing you're here for...

22:05.366 --> 22:08.655
Well, yeah. And the guy that you're
searching for, this Reynolds.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.030
- Yeah.
- Couldn't Curtis handle it?

22:10.120 --> 22:11.827
Yeah, I'm sure he can.
Why? What do you need?

22:11.914 --> 22:13.405
Well, I asked William what he needs,

22:13.499 --> 22:15.912
and he needs a tutor.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.584
Well, lucky for you and for him,

22:18.671 --> 22:21.960
you're looking at Nevada's
three-time State Mathletics Champion.

22:22.591 --> 22:23.627
Only three times?

22:23.717 --> 22:24.798
Yeah, they wouldn't
let freshmen enter.

22:24.885 --> 22:25.921
It was an ordeal.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.048
I got over it but still kinda hurts.

22:28.138 --> 22:29.754
This can't interfere
with an operation.

22:29.849 --> 22:30.839
No, we're in a holding pattern.

22:30.933 --> 22:32.674
I'm sure Curtis can come
and cover me.

22:32.768 --> 22:33.758
I might have to leave abruptly,

22:33.853 --> 22:35.515
but other than that, yeah, no,
it's not a problem.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.345
Well, I'll probably see you
back there. I'm gonna...

22:37.690 --> 22:39.647
Okay, yeah. Okay, yeah.

22:40.025 --> 22:42.392
Yeah, I'll call Curtis.
He'll be here soon.

22:42.486 --> 22:44.068
Okay. Okay, bye, bye.

22:50.744 --> 22:51.825
This is weird.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.320
JOHN: <i>Being back down here?</i>

22:53.414 --> 22:56.703
How many times have you
come down here to find me brooding?

22:56.792 --> 22:58.499
I'm not brooding, Oliver,
I'm thinking.

22:58.669 --> 22:59.659
Yeah.

23:03.507 --> 23:05.248
Okay, maybe I'm brooding
a little bit.

23:05.342 --> 23:07.925
Well, if you haven't
figured it out already,

23:08.012 --> 23:11.756
that expression is as much a part
of the uniform as the green hood.

23:11.849 --> 23:13.681
Every time you were
down here brooding,

23:14.143 --> 23:16.180
it was because you made
some kind of mistake.

23:18.522 --> 23:20.479
(SIGHS) I think you made
another one, man.

23:20.566 --> 23:21.556
No.

23:21.942 --> 23:23.058
Not even close.

23:23.444 --> 23:24.935
Who came to you? Rene?

23:25.195 --> 23:28.279
I needed to come
and ask Felicity a favor.

23:28.532 --> 23:30.148
And then, of course, I saw that very

23:30.826 --> 23:32.112
familiar expression.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.198
Makes me wonder
if maybe I asked too much of you.

23:34.288 --> 23:35.278
What do you mean?

23:35.372 --> 23:37.739
I gave up being
the Green Arrow for William.

23:38.876 --> 23:39.866
But...

23:40.794 --> 23:44.128
You have JJ, you have Lyla,
it doesn't exactly seem fair...

23:44.214 --> 23:46.046
That's not the issue at all, Oliver.

23:46.884 --> 23:49.001
I made my peace with
this whole life a long time ago.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.301
So what's the problem?

23:51.388 --> 23:52.845
I don't know how you did it.

23:54.350 --> 23:56.137
You never hesitated to make the call.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.386
You were always sure, I'm not.

23:59.855 --> 24:00.845
I was never sure.

24:02.775 --> 24:03.765
Not one time.

24:04.318 --> 24:07.561
I'm very flattered that it looked
that way on the outside,

24:07.655 --> 24:09.442
but on the inside, it was...

24:10.783 --> 24:13.400
It was instinct, it was instinct
and it was fear.

24:13.494 --> 24:14.530
Yeah, but you worked past it.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.282
Well, you'll work past it too.

24:16.747 --> 24:18.830
Now, I'm not gonna sit here
and say that you won't

24:20.167 --> 24:21.999
make mistakes, that you won't

24:22.419 --> 24:25.002
lose people along the way,
you know most...

24:26.340 --> 24:29.048
Most will be strangers but some...

24:30.844 --> 24:32.005
Well, some won't be.

24:32.805 --> 24:33.795
Because, John,

24:34.431 --> 24:36.013
you're one of the main reasons

24:36.350 --> 24:38.216
that the Green Arrow even exists.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.139
What are you talking about?

24:41.230 --> 24:42.311
The Restons.

24:42.606 --> 24:44.814
- The bank robbers?
- The bank robbers, yeah.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.650
You were the first person
who convinced me to look

24:48.153 --> 24:51.942
past just the names
on my father's list.

24:52.032 --> 24:54.775
You helped me discover that the hood,
that persona,

24:54.868 --> 24:57.485
he wasn't a hero,
you helped me find one.

24:57.579 --> 25:00.162
All of this, the Green Arrow,
the idea of it,

25:00.416 --> 25:03.955
it exists because you had
faith in me.

25:07.548 --> 25:09.835
Now you got to have
the same kind of faith in yourself.

25:11.301 --> 25:12.462
'Cause if you do,

25:17.266 --> 25:18.507
you can be a better leader,

25:19.935 --> 25:21.597
you can be a better hero

25:22.813 --> 25:23.974
than I ever was.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.239
ONYX: Sit Rep.
MAN: Good to go.

25:39.788 --> 25:40.778
Any doubts?

25:40.873 --> 25:41.863
You ask that each time.

25:42.166 --> 25:45.580
Because we are going after
our brothers-in-arms.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.460
Comrades.

25:48.088 --> 25:49.454
I need your resolve.

25:49.548 --> 25:50.538
You got it.

25:50.632 --> 25:52.373
And tonight, Reynolds gets his.

25:52.468 --> 25:53.458
Roger that.

25:53.635 --> 25:54.625
What about the Green Arrow?

25:55.804 --> 25:56.794
What about him?

25:57.931 --> 25:59.547
You've seen him in the field.

25:59.933 --> 26:03.222
Being highly trained operators,
would you consider him a threat?

26:03.312 --> 26:05.019
- Hell, no.
- There's your answer.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.387
Move out.

26:09.193 --> 26:10.479
Okay, and after you divide by X?

26:11.487 --> 26:13.444
Solve for X?

26:13.530 --> 26:14.816
Yes, but first...

26:15.949 --> 26:18.817
Is it factor the binomials?

26:18.911 --> 26:20.402
Yeah, right. Cool.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.741
But why can't I just solve for X?

26:22.831 --> 26:25.619
Well, you will, I mean, eventually,
probably in high school, but,

26:25.793 --> 26:28.001
first you have to master
the binomials.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.328
Well, I'm gonna bomb this.

26:29.463 --> 26:32.422
You know, it sucks
because you're new and

26:33.008 --> 26:34.419
probably a little behind. But...

26:34.676 --> 26:38.010
The fact that you're frustrated means
you can see how useful

26:38.263 --> 26:40.220
math could be,
which means, unfortunately,

26:42.017 --> 26:43.098
you're really good at it.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.896
Oliver said school doesn't matter
in the real world.

26:47.981 --> 26:51.019
Hmm. Well, Oliver didn't grow up
in the real world.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.443
School changed my life.

26:53.612 --> 26:54.853
I used to love school.

26:54.947 --> 26:55.937
Yeah.

26:56.156 --> 26:58.068
You will again. Promise.

27:01.870 --> 27:03.281
How is it going in here?

27:03.664 --> 27:05.326
- Good.
- Yeah, I'd say we're

27:05.791 --> 27:07.123
- making progress.
- Good.

27:07.209 --> 27:09.622
Could you tutor me some more
before the test?

27:10.671 --> 27:13.539
Yeah, I mean, if it's cool
with your dad, it's cool with me.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.715
If it's cool with you,
it's totally cool with me.

27:20.681 --> 27:22.547
Special delivery.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.598
WILLIAM: Okay,
that's not grilled cheese.

27:24.685 --> 27:27.143
No, it's not grilled cheese,
those are Monte Cristos.

27:27.229 --> 27:28.470
What's a Monte Cristo?

27:28.564 --> 27:29.645
What? You've never had...

27:30.732 --> 27:34.271
This is the best night-time snack
you can ever have.

27:34.361 --> 27:35.727
- And you used waffles.
- Well...

27:36.321 --> 27:38.404
That is how we do it
in the not-real world.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.776
- Ha.
- (CELLPHONE BEEPS)

27:41.660 --> 27:43.367
Curtis got a location
on Reynolds.

27:43.871 --> 27:45.954
We got to... Well, I got to go.

27:46.039 --> 27:47.496
This is... Without you. It's weird.

27:47.583 --> 27:48.619
Best of luck out there.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.041
Oh, I'll be in the bunker if it is.

27:50.377 --> 27:52.369
- William, you're awesome.
- Thank you.

27:52.462 --> 27:53.452
See you soon.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.748
She is pretty cool.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.338
Yeah, she is.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.463
Traffic cams picked up
Reynolds heading north on Hillcrest,

28:03.557 --> 28:06.470
the only things out there
are souvenirs and Haselby Grand.

28:06.560 --> 28:09.394
Hotels are a great place for
an ex-spook to stash a gold bag.

28:09.479 --> 28:11.141
Try to slip out
with the tourist crowd.

28:11.231 --> 28:12.972
Huh. Makes you wonder if
his old crew tipped him off

28:13.066 --> 28:14.807
or if he's just the luckiest target
in the world.

28:14.902 --> 28:17.110
DINAH DRAKE: <i>Either way, there are
hundreds of people in that hotel,</i>

28:17.196 --> 28:19.153
- so if they disperse the gas...
- They won't.

28:19.865 --> 28:20.855
Let's move out.

28:22.409 --> 28:24.150
Did he forget to say "Suit up"?

28:24.369 --> 28:26.611
Or was "Let's move"
like, his version of "Suit up"?

28:26.705 --> 28:29.197
Because, personally, I like "Let's
suit up" 'cause then you know...

28:29.291 --> 28:31.123
- (TOGETHER) Go suit up, Curtis.
- Yeah, I'll go suit up.

28:35.088 --> 28:36.078
Hey, hey.

28:37.633 --> 28:38.874
Can you handle this?

28:41.511 --> 28:43.127
I asked Oliver to come back.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.760
Well, the fact that he didn't
should tell you something, right?

28:45.849 --> 28:47.886
Maybe. Look, all I know for sure,

28:48.644 --> 28:50.385
if John doesn't
straighten himself out,

28:50.479 --> 28:52.061
it's gonna be another rough night.

and the gas.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.097
I have him. Upper lobby.

30:17.190 --> 30:18.601
But I got no way
of detecting the gas.

30:18.692 --> 30:20.979
Canary, Terrific,
see if you can locate the gas.

30:21.069 --> 30:23.652

after we clear Reynolds.

but I don't suggest it

Onyx is in the limo.

33:55.158 --> 33:56.194
What about this guy?

33:56.284 --> 33:58.697
He helped steal millions in foreign
gold and turned a blind eye

33:58.787 --> 34:01.495
when his comrades were being
killed off of fake terrorist attacks.

34:02.958 --> 34:04.324
It was good work back there.

34:04.417 --> 34:06.124
Following your lead, hoss.

34:11.882 --> 34:13.498
Can we do this after every win?

34:13.592 --> 34:15.710
New tradition for a new era,
I like that.

34:15.844 --> 34:17.710
To go with our new
Team Arrow victory dance.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.259
Didn't know we had an old one.

34:19.349 --> 34:20.590
We don't, never will.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.934
Things won't be changing around here
that much.

34:25.438 --> 34:26.428
Look...

34:28.315 --> 34:29.351
There is something you should know.

34:29.442 --> 34:30.431
You went to Oliver.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.235
- You told him.
- JOHN: She didn't have to.

34:34.447 --> 34:35.563
I know you, Rene.

34:36.866 --> 34:38.027
I know all of you.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.368
It's a leader's job to.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.406
Oh, yes.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.827
So, Curtis and I have been
working on a little something

34:48.920 --> 34:51.253
<i>in our spare time,
very limited spare time, may I add.</i>

34:51.922 --> 34:53.380
We call it...

34:53.967 --> 34:55.958
The Green Monster. (CHUCKLES)

34:56.303 --> 34:57.464
Or something cooler than that,

34:57.554 --> 34:58.761
pretty much whatever
you want to call it.

34:59.139 --> 35:02.632
The important part is that it shoots
arrows instead of crossbow bolts.

35:02.726 --> 35:04.183
260 pound draw weight,

35:04.269 --> 35:06.761
the arrows exit the gate at 400FPS,
that's feet per second.

35:06.855 --> 35:09.063
<i>Integrated recoil
energy dissipation system.</i>

35:09.149 --> 35:12.017
Adjustable mount, scope,
quick detach quivers,

35:12.110 --> 35:14.944
pistol grip, finger guard,
non-slip rubber insert.

35:15.030 --> 35:16.441
Do you two want a moment alone?

35:16.906 --> 35:18.397
You want to take it for a spin?

35:30.754 --> 35:31.744
Damn, hoss.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.955
Did you guys put stabilizers
on that crossbow?

35:34.049 --> 35:36.541
Nope. That aim there
is pure John Diggle.

35:36.635 --> 35:37.876
Not a bad idea, though,
for the next upgrade.

35:46.227 --> 35:47.388
Nice going.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.094
Steady.

35:49.606 --> 35:51.518
See? Told you. Tremor's gone.

35:51.608 --> 35:53.474
Well, I'm convinced.

35:54.611 --> 35:56.227
You were wrong
about one thing, though.

35:56.321 --> 35:57.311
What's that?

35:59.866 --> 36:02.279
You can make the hard calls
on your own just fine.

36:12.212 --> 36:13.202
Thank you.

36:15.006 --> 36:15.996
Hey.

36:17.342 --> 36:19.755
So your friends did good last night.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.836
I had a feeling
John would get it together.

36:22.097 --> 36:23.133
How did you manage?

36:23.223 --> 36:25.590
Too many councilmen owe Pollard
too many favors.

36:25.684 --> 36:26.925
It's gonna pass, Oliver.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.008
We'll veto it.

36:28.103 --> 36:30.561
You got enough PR problems as it is,
don't you think?

36:30.647 --> 36:32.604
Besides, they've got enough votes
for an override.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.603
There has to be something
that we can do.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.104
Matter of fact...

36:36.986 --> 36:39.945
Let the record show there are no nays
on the anti-vigilante measure.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.363
<i>Those in favor.</i>

36:41.449 --> 36:42.439
Point of order.

36:44.285 --> 36:46.572
Does it address
the matter at hand, Mr. Mayor?

36:46.663 --> 36:48.620
It does, Madam Parliamentarian.

36:51.126 --> 36:52.162
OLIVER: Thank you.

36:52.252 --> 36:53.242
And good morning.

36:54.045 --> 36:58.415
As you know, I have been accused
of a great many things recently.

36:58.591 --> 37:01.800
Including but not limited
to supporting vigilantes

37:01.886 --> 37:04.094
at the expense
of our men and women in uniform.

37:05.432 --> 37:06.889
This was never my intention.

37:07.308 --> 37:09.345
<i>In the wake of the attacks
on the SCPD,</i>

37:09.436 --> 37:11.678
putting this police force
back on its feet

37:11.771 --> 37:14.138
is my number one priority as mayor.

37:14.315 --> 37:19.435
We need the women and men of the SCPD
on our streets protecting us,

37:19.529 --> 37:20.690
but they can't do that

37:21.489 --> 37:24.106
if they are busy hunting vigilantes.

37:25.201 --> 37:27.158
<i>That is why I oppose this bill,</i>

37:27.245 --> 37:30.659
and that is why I am invoking
chapter 9 of the City Charter.

37:34.502 --> 37:38.212
And you are aware that will convert
Councilwoman Pollard's bill

37:38.298 --> 37:40.085
to a citywide referendum.

37:40.425 --> 37:41.415
I certainly am.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.171
<i>Because last night,</i>

37:43.636 --> 37:47.471
a group of vigilantes
saved hundreds of lives.

37:48.475 --> 37:50.637
So if we are going to decide

37:50.727 --> 37:53.936
on diverting police resources
towards stopping them,

37:54.689 --> 37:58.273
we are not gonna do that until
the people of Star City have spoken.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.568
What the hell was that?

38:06.075 --> 38:07.611
Stay of execution.

38:10.997 --> 38:13.080
NEWSREADER:
<i>The mayor's procedural maneuver</i>

38:13.166 --> 38:15.783
<i>took both the Council
and the public by surprise.</i>

38:15.877 --> 38:17.413
<i>How the public will decide</i>

38:17.504 --> 38:20.292
<i>on the issue of vigilantism
is anyone's guess.</i>

38:20.381 --> 38:23.840
<i>According to multiple reports,
the City Council was set to pass</i>

38:23.927 --> 38:26.840
<i>strict measures against
the Green Arrow and his team.</i>

38:27.055 --> 38:29.763
<i>This anti-vigilante legislation
was introduced...</i>

38:29.849 --> 38:32.091
Who are you protecting?

38:32.185 --> 38:33.596
(NEWSREADER CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)

38:49.577 --> 38:50.567
Oliver.

38:51.454 --> 38:52.990
- With a gift.
- You busy?

38:53.164 --> 38:54.450
No, um...

38:55.875 --> 38:56.991
No, I... Come in.

38:57.252 --> 38:59.960
I was just working
on a name for the startup

39:00.046 --> 39:02.880
which would be a lot easier
if Curtis and I actually knew

39:02.966 --> 39:05.253
what we were trying to start up.

39:06.052 --> 39:08.385
You know,
"That's tomorrow's problem."

39:11.432 --> 39:12.593
Is it my birthday?

39:12.684 --> 39:13.765
William got an A on his test.

39:13.893 --> 39:15.350
Oh, he did? Oh, that's awesome.

39:15.436 --> 39:17.348
I mean, I knew he would,
he is super smart,

39:17.438 --> 39:19.555
his understanding of math
is at prodigy level, much...

39:20.275 --> 39:22.358
Like me at his age. (CHUCKLES)

39:22.694 --> 39:23.730
Can you believe he's your son?

39:23.987 --> 39:26.400
I didn't mean it...
That's not what I meant. I mean...

39:26.489 --> 39:28.025
Math isn't everything.

39:28.116 --> 39:30.733
I mean, you have, you have so many
redeeming qualities, you know,

39:30.827 --> 39:32.910
you have amazing abs and...

39:34.622 --> 39:35.658
I'm just gonna open this.

39:35.748 --> 39:36.738
- Please.
- If it's okay.

39:39.961 --> 39:41.042
Hmm.

39:41.588 --> 39:42.920
It's a key to my apartment.

39:44.424 --> 39:45.460
Okay.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.299
Um...

39:50.430 --> 39:52.217
Won't that be confusing for William?

39:52.307 --> 39:54.674
I mean, it sure as hell
is confusing for me.

39:54.851 --> 39:57.468
I know that when I took William in,

39:57.562 --> 40:00.521
we agreed that we would
keep our distance because

40:02.400 --> 40:04.016
he was gonna have a lot to process.

40:04.110 --> 40:05.646
- He's still got a lot to process.
- Yes, he does.

40:05.737 --> 40:09.026
Every day there's a new challenge.

40:10.450 --> 40:12.908
I sense a "but" coming,
there is a "but" coming, right?

40:12.994 --> 40:15.532
But I saw you with him.

40:17.498 --> 40:19.911
And I became 100% sure that...

40:20.335 --> 40:21.667
If you want...

40:22.837 --> 40:23.827
His life

40:24.672 --> 40:25.788
will be better

40:26.049 --> 40:27.210
with you in it.

40:30.053 --> 40:31.339
Just like mine.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.754
Are you sure

40:34.515 --> 40:35.756
that's what you want?

40:36.184 --> 40:37.174
I'm sure.

41:17.684 --> 41:18.845
(SIGHS)
