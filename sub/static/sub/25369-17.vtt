And remember, I'm talking
about Spider‐Man.

He heat zaps her,
so she turns into Glass Girl,

Then he's seriously about
to smash her into little pieces,

00:13.013 --> 00:16.141
but I stopped him,
so now he apparently hates me.

00:16.141 --> 00:19.144
Ugh! I mean,
that's not him, right?

00:19.144 --> 00:21.897
It can't be.
Maybe he's a clone or something.

00:21.897 --> 00:24.233
Thank you for coming
to me with this.

00:24.233 --> 00:28.237
Spidey had my back once,
so if there's a chance he's
in trouble, I'm here to help.

00:28.237 --> 00:30.906
Awesome! So what
do you think's going on?

00:30.906 --> 00:33.200
Well, could be
a shape‐shifting alien.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.619
What? Is that a thing?

00:35.619 --> 00:39.248
Of course. But officially,
I never said that.

00:39.248 --> 00:42.584
Look, I know
one thing's for sure.
Pete needs us.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.962
I know we don't

maybe we can get the,

00:51.009 --> 00:53.387
Don't worry.
We got your back.

you'd say that.

to the "Advanced Idea" part

Why so quiet, bug‐brain?
Afraid?

No. Annoyed.

01:51.153 --> 01:54.740
Hey, how did‐‐ Uh‐oh.

01:54.740 --> 01:57.242
I came expecting A. I. M.

01:57.242 --> 02:01.705
You think I wouldn't be prepared
to disable every single one
of your weapons?

02:01.705 --> 02:04.291
You may have planned
for our weapons,

02:04.291 --> 02:08.086
but in a warehouse full of them,
did you ever plan on this?

02:08.086 --> 02:09.671

02:09.671 --> 02:10.672
Hm. Unexpected.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.674
[laughing]

02:28.357 --> 02:31.276
I should've accessed
their inventory database

02:31.276 --> 02:33.528
and planned for all the weapons
available here.

02:35.280 --> 02:39.159

11:03.997 --> 11:07.333
not the ones that whine
about what's fair.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.672
Power...

11:12.672 --> 11:15.633
I do have power.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.303
Oh, boy.

11:19.804 --> 11:22.599
[Superior Spider‐Man groaning]

11:22.599 --> 11:25.101
Hey, there, PJ's.
We took those scans
we wanted.

11:25.101 --> 11:28.396
Wasn't so bad.
Might even be a lollipop
in your future.

11:28.396 --> 11:32.692
Not so bad?
He rode you like a surfboard.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.862
Ah, right.
Yeah, no lollipop.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.448
Million‐dollar dry cleaning
bill instead.

11:38.448 --> 11:42.493
Sorry to break up
the comedy hour.
Excuse us.

11:42.493 --> 11:45.538
[growls, gasps]
Need to confer
with my colleagues.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.708
So, what now?

11:48.708 --> 11:51.836
What do you mean?
The scans confirm it's him.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.464
The real him.
But aliens could've‐‐

11:54.464 --> 11:57.717
No aliens.
I checked.

11:57.717 --> 12:01.554
I don't know, Tony.
His fighting style‐‐
it's different.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.307
A different skill set
than the last time I saw him.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.768
This whole thing
doesn't add up.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.561
Spidey wouldn't
act this way.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.064
He's a friend,
and you two are his idols.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.857
You check
for mind control?

12:12.857 --> 12:15.401
Mind control, doppelgangers,
LMDs, cloning,

12:15.401 --> 12:17.946
Asgardian illusion spells,
holo‐disguises.

12:17.946 --> 12:21.449
Negative on all.
It's the kid.
That's Peter Parker.

12:21.449 --> 12:24.744
It's a sad fact,
but sometimes
people just change.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.413
[Superior Spider‐Man]
Congratulations, Stark.
[all grunt]

12:29.832 --> 12:32.585
You wasted your time
proving the obvious.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.837
[Iron Man]
Away from the controls,
kid, now!

12:34.837 --> 12:38.675
I don't think so.
Despite my warnings,
[Avengers yell]

12:38.675 --> 12:40.677
you forced my hand,
wasting my time.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.679
So to make up for it,

12:42.679 --> 12:44.806
you are now my chauffer.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.933
Does this mean
I get to hit him again?

12:46.933 --> 12:48.810
Because I'd be
okay with that.

12:48.810 --> 12:51.854
Oh, you do not want
to stop the bad guys?

12:51.854 --> 12:55.024
The ones I was tracking
before you absconded with me?

12:55.024 --> 12:57.235
I am sure you remember A. I. M.

12:57.235 --> 12:58.945
Explain.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.822
There has been
a rash of break‐ins

13:00.822 --> 13:03.408
at science labs,
so I laid in wait.

13:03.408 --> 13:07.370
Meanwhile, my spider‐bots
have been picking up chatter,
something called a‐‐

13:07.370 --> 13:10.331
Doomsday Chair.
You've heard this too?

13:10.331 --> 13:12.959
Ever since we took down
the Scientist Supreme,

13:12.959 --> 13:14.877
something big's
been in the works.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.714
An A. I. M. agent I interrogated
mentioned a Doomsday Chair.

13:17.714 --> 13:20.049
Then it is your good fortune
that you ran into me,

13:20.049 --> 13:21.884
as I have
their base coordinates.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.554
Prepare yourselves.
[Ms. Marvel]
Wait. Let us st‐‐

13:24.554 --> 13:26.264
[screams]

13:29.058 --> 13:30.768
Huh?
Huh?

13:30.768 --> 13:32.979
<i>[bots]</i>
<i>Structural failure detected.</i>
What?

13:32.979 --> 13:35.023
<i>Notify maintenance.</i>

13:37.025 --> 13:39.360
[grunting]

13:40.361 --> 13:41.946
[both grunt]

13:44.991 --> 13:47.660
Everybody‐‐
Surrender,

13:47.660 --> 13:51.622
before me and my lackeys
destroy you completely.

13:51.622 --> 13:52.957
[Avengers]
"Lackeys"?

13:52.957 --> 13:55.877
[A.I.M. agent]
Ah, you brought the Avengers.

13:55.877 --> 13:58.004
Perfect. Perfect!

13:58.004 --> 14:00.131
Explain your meaning, now.

14:00.131 --> 14:03.176
Did you think
we wouldn't find your toy?

14:03.176 --> 14:06.637
We already planned to test
our newest weapon on you.

14:06.637 --> 14:10.016
But the Avengers as well?
Beyond hopes.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.810
Okay. I don't
speak Villain‐ese.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.312
What's going on?
What weapon?

14:14.312 --> 14:17.857
Allow us to introduce
the next Scientist Supreme,

14:17.857 --> 14:21.903
a Mental Organism Designed
Only for Kaos,

14:21.903 --> 14:25.531
otherwise known as... MODOK!

14:25.531 --> 14:29.077
[cackling]

14:31.871 --> 14:35.374
[sighs]
Sorry. I'm sorry.
Don't mind me.

14:35.374 --> 14:39.337
It's just the big,
floating baby head.
[cackling]

14:39.337 --> 14:42.131
[growling]
Whew!
[cackling]

14:42.131 --> 14:44.050
[yells]
[Avengers yell]

14:44.050 --> 14:47.220
[MODOK]
Go ahead,
laugh at me now, fools!

14:47.220 --> 14:51.516
[laughing]
He seems to have technopathic
control of this environment!

14:51.516 --> 14:53.851
Avengers! Imbeciles!

14:53.851 --> 14:55.103
[grunts]
[grunts]

14:55.103 --> 14:56.646
Aah!
[grunts]

14:56.646 --> 14:58.523
[screaming]
[laughing]

15:00.733 --> 15:03.778
[screaming]

15:03.778 --> 15:05.780
You are foolish
to challenge me.

15:05.780 --> 15:08.950
I am the apex
of A. I. M. technology!
What?

15:08.950 --> 15:12.036
Ha! Open‐wire access
on a hovercraft?
[yells]

15:12.036 --> 15:15.456
No, no, no, no, no!
Say good‐bye to your
stabilizer control, monstrosity!

15:15.456 --> 15:18.751
[yelling]

15:18.751 --> 15:21.003
Avengers, gather together!

15:21.003 --> 15:23.172
That's not how we say that.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.552
Here's the plan:
Widow, flank left,
draw their fire.

15:27.552 --> 15:30.429
Stark, lay down cover
and take down
the encroaching bots.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.140
Marvel, approach MODOK
from behind.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.767
Usually, to be in charge
of the Avengers,

15:34.767 --> 15:38.062
you have to first
be a member of the Avengers.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.231
So, what do we do, boss?

15:40.231 --> 15:42.024
Aah!
[groans]

15:42.024 --> 15:43.860
Aah!
[grunts]

15:43.860 --> 15:45.486
[laughing]

15:47.196 --> 15:49.615
Widow, flank left,
draw their fire.

15:49.615 --> 15:52.118
I'll lay down cover
and take down
the encroaching bots.

15:52.118 --> 15:55.288
Marvel, approach MODOK
from behind.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.750
[grunting]

16:05.798 --> 16:08.759
Finally, obedience
from my underlings.

16:08.759 --> 16:11.179
Now I can
enact my plan.

16:11.179 --> 16:13.723
Your skills do you credit,
child,
[gasps]

16:13.723 --> 16:18.811
but you face the power of MODOK,
a force of pure Kaos!
[groaning]

16:18.811 --> 16:21.939
Good‐bye.
I'm the child?

16:21.939 --> 16:24.984
You're the one
with the big, fat, baby head!

16:24.984 --> 16:26.611
[growls]

16:26.611 --> 16:27.945
[grunts]

16:27.945 --> 16:29.947
Ms. Marvel!

16:29.947 --> 16:31.115
[chuckling]

16:31.115 --> 16:33.201
[grunts, groans]

16:33.201 --> 16:35.369
[laughing]

16:35.369 --> 16:37.580
[chuckling]

16:37.580 --> 16:39.582
What happened here,
Ottoman!
[gasps]

16:39.582 --> 16:41.876
I copied you exactly,
but I failed!

16:41.876 --> 16:44.629
Guess you ain't as smart
as you think.

16:44.629 --> 16:46.172
[chuckles]

16:46.172 --> 16:48.716
Do you not understand,
you imbecile?

16:48.716 --> 16:51.010
I failed on purpose.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.013
But that means you
got an "F," too, doofus!

16:54.013 --> 16:55.765
Mm, yes.

16:55.765 --> 17:00.561
But my superior grades
can easily absorb
one failed exam.

17:00.561 --> 17:04.232
However,
you're more fragile standing
will never recover.

17:04.232 --> 17:06.317
Good‐bye, sports.

17:06.317 --> 17:08.361
Good‐bye, scholarship‐‐
Huh?

17:08.361 --> 17:11.906
...the only way
you could possibly hope
to get into a good college.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.950
[growling]
[laughs]
Don't you see?

17:13.950 --> 17:16.035
I've ruined you utterly,

17:16.035 --> 17:19.497
and all without
lifting a finger.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.499
[grunts, gasps]
[car approaches]

17:21.499 --> 17:23.251
[horn honks]
You'll pay for‐‐

17:23.251 --> 17:26.128
Steve,
quit messing around.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.922
Car, now!

17:27.922 --> 17:31.175
We're gonna have a little talk
about your grades.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.552
[whimpering]
[growling]

17:32.552 --> 17:34.971
Steve!

17:34.971 --> 17:36.931
[breathes shakily]

17:36.931 --> 17:39.183
[car door opens, closes]
That‐‐

17:39.183 --> 17:42.478
That was... amazing!
[car departing]

17:42.478 --> 17:46.023
So that's what Ock does
with great power?

17:46.023 --> 17:49.110
Destroys people's lives?
Huh.

17:49.110 --> 17:51.946
And if I didn't have Ben and May
to teach me better,

17:51.946 --> 17:54.073
could I have
turned out like that?

17:54.073 --> 17:58.244
Vengeful? A villain?

17:58.244 --> 18:00.037
[groaning]

18:00.037 --> 18:02.873
So much for the brilliant
Spider‐Man plan.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.669
[laughing]
[Superior Spider‐Man]
MODOK!

18:06.669 --> 18:08.462
Face me,
you absurd creature!
[growls]

18:08.462 --> 18:11.465
What can you possibly do
with that mental device?

18:11.465 --> 18:14.385
Your feeble mind
is sorely limited.

18:14.385 --> 18:19.223
Do you think you are
the first individual to use tech
to gain mental powers?

18:19.223 --> 18:23.019
I, myself, have some experience
in this arena.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.145
[all yell]

18:26.272 --> 18:27.857
[yells, grunts]

18:28.941 --> 18:31.402
[growling]
[groans]
Okay.

18:31.402 --> 18:34.322
In retrospect,
maybe there are some merits
to the kid's plan.

18:34.322 --> 18:35.823
[yells]

18:37.074 --> 18:39.285
[both straining]

18:41.954 --> 18:44.248
[straining intensifies]

18:45.958 --> 18:47.001
[yells]

18:47.001 --> 18:50.588
[yelling]

18:53.049 --> 18:54.508
[MODOK groans]

18:54.508 --> 18:56.677
[yelling]

19:00.097 --> 19:02.933
[grunting]

19:02.933 --> 19:04.977
[groans]
[Superior Spider‐Man chuckles]

19:04.977 --> 19:07.188
While you were busy
chasing down my minions,

19:07.188 --> 19:09.357
I defeated you, MODOK.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.942
And I didn't even
have to lift a finger.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.570
Wait.
Were you using us?

19:14.570 --> 19:18.324
Your whole plan
was to use us as bait
while you got the mental device?

19:18.324 --> 19:20.326
You were not
the worst sidekicks.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.453
But if I ever have
need of you again,

19:22.453 --> 19:25.456
please remember to check
your egos at the door.

19:25.456 --> 19:28.292
I will leave the cleanup
to you.

19:28.292 --> 19:33.172
[sighs]
He used to be nice, sweet.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.966
He can no longer
be trusted.

19:35.966 --> 19:38.010
And this is coming
from a spy.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.012
I don't know.
Love him or hate him,

19:40.012 --> 19:42.390
it's indisputable
that Spider‐Man
is better at this

19:42.390 --> 19:44.809
than ever before.

19:44.809 --> 19:49.105
Well, even though Ock and I
aren't as different
as I thought,

19:49.105 --> 19:51.982
this isn't getting me any closer
to escaping this place.

19:51.982 --> 19:55.236
Computer, can you fast‐forward
these memories?

19:55.236 --> 19:57.905
<i>[computer]</i>
<i>Accessing fast‐forward.</i>

19:57.905 --> 20:00.032
[gasping]

20:02.201 --> 20:04.203
This is from the beginning
of the school year,

20:04.203 --> 20:08.416
when Ock had Gwen, Anya,
and Miles hooked
into the computer.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.209
Computer, pause.
<i>[beeps]</i>

20:10.209 --> 20:14.004
They sent a blast
of mental feedback at him.

20:14.004 --> 20:16.006
At the same time,
Carolyn Trainer and I

20:16.006 --> 20:17.675
went in to wallop him big‐time.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.055
It all started here.

20:23.055 --> 20:26.183
Ock fell into a coma‐‐
Or at least I thought he did.

20:26.183 --> 20:29.228
It turns out
that was just his body.

20:29.228 --> 20:33.399
He must have
wirelessly downloaded
his mind into‐‐ into‐‐

20:33.399 --> 20:36.360
into his arms.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.154
But how?

20:38.154 --> 20:41.615
Computer, show me
any command codes
activated at this moment.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.617
Huh.

20:43.617 --> 20:46.454
"Data Log 47E127."

20:46.454 --> 20:49.457
This has to be
the execution command Ock used

20:49.457 --> 20:52.251
to transfer his consciousness
into his arms.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.296
Computer, terminal command.
Execute.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.214
<i>[beeps]</i>

20:57.214 --> 21:01.552

<i>All the tests check out,</i>

<i>That Spidey's better than ever,</i>
<i>even if he is a pain.</i>

21:06.432 --> 21:07.933

21:07.933 --> 21:11.520
Uh, thanks for trying,
Ms. Marvel. Gotta go.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.564

Ock's arms, alive?

Help."

21:28.537 --> 21:29.538
Peter?!
