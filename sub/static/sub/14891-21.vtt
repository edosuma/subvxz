the white zone at the airport.

01:25.285 --> 01:29.122
Welcome home, oh!

01:29.155 --> 01:30.724
Oh, it’s so good to be home.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.527
Well, Jennifer,
you look exhausted.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.401
Why don’t we, uh,
go upstairs and take a nap?

01:43.570 --> 01:46.139
Larry, I‐I’m not sleepy.

01:46.172 --> 01:47.508
Yeah, but, Jennifer, you know

01:47.541 --> 01:50.243
every time you come back
from a long trip

01:50.276 --> 01:52.278
we take a nap.

01:54.748 --> 01:57.283
Oh, oh, a nap.

01:57.317 --> 01:59.820
Well, I’m a little hungry,
why don’t we have lunch first?

01:59.853 --> 02:02.756
You’re in luck,
I have plenty of cold yak loaf.

02:05.759 --> 02:08.228
Uh, uh, Jennifer,
it’s, uh, been two weeks

02:08.261 --> 02:09.795
since I’ve had a nap.

02:15.435 --> 02:17.871
I mean, if I were
any sleepier, I’d explode.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.512
Well, alright.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.782
I should have eaten
on the plane.

02:31.384 --> 02:33.319
Oh, great.

02:33.353 --> 02:35.856
She prefers airline food
over my yak loaf.

02:37.457 --> 02:40.426
I love your yak loaf.

02:40.460 --> 02:41.795
Well, if nobody cares
about my yak loaf

all about your trip.

03:05.351 --> 03:06.887
Honolulu and San Francisco?

03:08.922 --> 03:10.657
Fine.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.659
I brought you
a present from Tahiti.

03:15.662 --> 03:16.763
Oh!

03:18.832 --> 03:22.235
This is the biggest gummy bear
I have ever seen.

‐Balki, Balki!
‐Mm? Mm‐hmm.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.575
It’s not a gummy bear.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.877
It’s a Polynesian marriage God.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.879
The legend says
if you give it to someone

03:32.913 --> 03:36.583
you’ll be married to them
by the next full moon.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.852
This is gonna come in handy
in case I ever meet anyone

03:38.885 --> 03:40.286
I want to marry.

03:51.698 --> 03:53.534
I’m worried about Mary Anne.

03:57.804 --> 04:00.406
Larry, all she talked about
on this trip was Balki.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.576
She really wants to marry him
but he just doesn’t get it.

04:08.682 --> 04:11.351
W‐what...
Isn’t‐isn’t this something

04:11.384 --> 04:13.554
that we could talk about later?

04:13.587 --> 04:15.055
Mm, la‐later is good.

‐Mm? Mm.
‐Mm.

04:19.692 --> 04:22.696
Oh, later is no good.

Alright, alright. Look,
you’re right. You’re right.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.834
But this is not a‐a new problem.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.670
I mean,
Mary Anne has wanted Balki

04:29.703 --> 04:31.772
to marry her for a long time.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.006
It’s much worse now

04:33.039 --> 04:34.608
it’s gotten to the point
where every time

04:34.641 --> 04:35.909
she sees a woman
with a wedding ring on

04:35.942 --> 04:37.744
she breaks down.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.479
W‐w‐well, don’t worry.

04:39.513 --> 04:42.516
I mean, they’ll work it out.

04:42.549 --> 04:44.484
Yeah, they’ll work it out.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.290
Oh, there’s no way
they can work it out.

really upsetting to me

04:53.059 --> 04:55.729

when I’m upset.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.700
Okay, alright,
alright, alright, alright.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.334
I’ll tell you what
I’m gonna do, alright?

05:01.367 --> 05:03.870
I’m gonna do downstairs
and‐and talk to Balki

05:03.904 --> 05:06.907
and‐and tell him that Mary Anne
wants him to propose.

05:06.940 --> 05:10.010
Then I’m gonna come back
and we’ll take a nap.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.779
‐Maybe two.
‐Larry, you can’t do that!

05:12.813 --> 05:15.348
Oh, sure I can,
it’s been two weeks.

05:15.381 --> 05:16.650
No, come on, no.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.787
What I mean is a woman

05:20.821 --> 05:22.889
wants a man to propose
because he’s in love

05:22.923 --> 05:25.592
not because someone told him to.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.360
I want you to go talk to Balki

05:27.393 --> 05:29.530
get him to realize
how much he loves Mary Anne

05:29.563 --> 05:30.897
how much she loves him

05:30.931 --> 05:33.534
and how perfect
they are for each other.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.101
But don’t use
any of those words.

I can’t tell you her name.

Oh, this is a game.
Is she living or dead?

shouldn’t we hurry upstairs?

I’m still a little tense.

07:56.276 --> 07:57.744
I need to be relaxed
to take a nap

07:57.778 --> 07:59.546
and folding laundry
helps me do that.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.720
Okay, okay, it’s a little weird

this is a good idea

understand everything?

09:11.952 --> 09:14.287
I‐I would have said something
to you earlier but

09:14.320 --> 09:17.591
I just didn’t feel comfortable
talking to you about it.

09:17.624 --> 09:19.092
Well, I can understand that.

09:21.828 --> 09:24.665
It just seemed better
to have Larry tell you.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.967
Yeah, yeah, that takes
the pressure off of you

09:27.000 --> 09:29.736

09:42.082 --> 09:43.817
then nothing should
stand in their way.

09:45.652 --> 09:46.753

you should make your move?

‐Jennifer, Jennifer, please.
‐Oh! Oh!

now listen to me. Listen to me.

set on things being different.

speak about this

I had to leave Mypos

the other side of the island

You remember last summer,
when Balki and I were out

13:05.519 --> 13:07.253
on a lake alone in the rowboat?

13:09.990 --> 13:11.525
I should have killed him then.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.230
Larry, you have to go
talk to him again.

13:17.263 --> 13:22.002
Jennifer, I would love to see
Balki and Mary Anne get married

13:22.035 --> 13:23.570
but we can’t force it.

13:25.539 --> 13:28.174
I know how women think.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.046
Mary Anne has waited this long

13:33.079 --> 13:36.149
if she has to,
she will wait a lot longer.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.219
I can’t wait any longer.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.957
Balki’s never gonna ask me
to marry him, so I’m moving out.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.893
[instrumental music]

13:51.632 --> 13:54.000
[instrumental music]

13:58.071 --> 13:59.405
‐Balki...
‐Cousin, look.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.241
I want you to know
I talked to Jennifer

14:01.274 --> 14:03.076
and‐and that everything’s fine.

14:03.109 --> 14:05.579
But I really want you to know
that I did nothing

14:05.612 --> 14:08.014
to reduce her
to a quivering mass of desire.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.217
And I appreciate that.

14:12.418 --> 14:13.987
Thank you.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.323
But as long as we’re here

14:17.357 --> 14:20.627
why don’t we talk about...
another problem?

14:20.661 --> 14:23.363
Cousin, another dirty little
problem like the last one

14:23.396 --> 14:25.632
and we could end up
on "Sally Jessy Raphael."

14:27.200 --> 14:28.635
Listen to me.

14:28.669 --> 14:30.571
Listen to me.

14:30.604 --> 14:32.472
There is a woman...

14:33.974 --> 14:35.942
...who lives in this house...

14:39.045 --> 14:40.981
...not Jennifer.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.919
Not Jennifer...

14:48.221 --> 14:51.091
...who has something
she wants you to know.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.030
‐Mary Anne?
‐I didn’t use those words.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.065
‐Not Mary Anne?
‐Yes, Mary Anne.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.266
But you didn’t hear it from me.

15:01.668 --> 15:06.172
She loves you.
She cares about you very much.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.975
And you’d better talk to her
because in a few days

15:09.009 --> 15:11.612
it will be too late.

15:11.645 --> 15:14.380
‐Why would it be too late?
‐Because she will be gone.

15:19.986 --> 15:21.487
Oh, God.

15:24.290 --> 15:27.127
Oh, cousin, oh, cousin,
I got to talk to her

15:27.160 --> 15:30.296
before it’s too late and...
and she will be gone.

15:31.665 --> 15:33.099
Yes, you do.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.334
And you don’t have
a moment to lose.

15:35.736 --> 15:37.203
And neither do I.

15:47.013 --> 15:49.583
Dimitri...brace yourself.

15:52.753 --> 15:55.155
Mary Anne only has
a few days to live.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.994
Is today’s newspaper here?

16:01.027 --> 16:02.462
I wanna read the funnies.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.330
Laughter is the best medicine.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.467
Mary Anne, Mary Anne, Mary Anne.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.070
I want to talk to you.

16:10.103 --> 16:12.472
Oh? About what?

16:12.506 --> 16:16.409
About...you, and how you feel.

16:16.442 --> 16:18.779
Oh, suddenly you care
about how I feel?

16:18.812 --> 16:21.414
Yes, I do. I do.

16:21.447 --> 16:24.050
And‐and I’m so sorry
I didn’t realize sooner

16:24.084 --> 16:25.218
what was going on.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.755
Well, I hinted at it.

16:28.789 --> 16:31.291
But maybe I should’ve just
come right out and told you.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.293
Should’ve, could’ve, would’ve.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.428
Mary Anne,
let’s not conjugate our lives.

16:41.467 --> 16:44.605
What’s important is that
I want you to know

16:44.638 --> 16:47.741
that I want to spend
every minute of the rest

16:47.774 --> 16:49.475
of your life with you.

16:51.578 --> 16:54.347
Doing everything that I
possibly can to‐to make you

16:54.380 --> 16:56.316
as happy as you can be.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.453
Balki, this is the happiest
day of my life!

17:00.486 --> 17:01.622
[Balki sobbing]

17:04.390 --> 17:06.760
Well, you certainly do have
a good attitude about this.

17:09.796 --> 17:10.864
Now, when the big day comes

17:10.896 --> 17:13.133
do you think we should
make a major event out of it

17:13.165 --> 17:14.701
or should we just keep it
small and intimate?

17:20.406 --> 17:23.777
Well, that’s kind of up to you.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.680
A‐after all,
it‐it will be your day.

17:28.448 --> 17:29.516
Then I want
a lot of people there.

17:29.550 --> 17:32.418
It’ll be wonderful.
My mother will cry her eyes out.

17:37.824 --> 17:40.727
Well, of course she will!
I’ll cry my eyes out!

17:40.761 --> 17:42.563
[sobbing]

17:42.596 --> 17:45.431
Oh, Balki, you’re so sensitive.

17:45.465 --> 17:48.101
Well, who wouldn’t be?

17:48.134 --> 17:50.303
I’ll wear the same dress
my grandmother wore.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.747
And I thought
we had some weird customs.

18:02.616 --> 18:03.884
Let’s go tell
Jennifer and Larry.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.752
Jennifer’s going
to be so excited.

18:05.786 --> 18:08.388
Well, I suppose so.
She does look good in black.

18:11.892 --> 18:14.628
Jennifer, Larry!
Come down quick!

18:14.661 --> 18:17.330
And I want to get a really
good band so everyone can dance.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.235
‐Hurry!
‐What is it?

18:24.404 --> 18:26.540
We have some really big news.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.609
Well, couldn’t it have waited
just a few minutes?

18:32.278 --> 18:33.547
The big news?

18:34.648 --> 18:35.649
Yes.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.551
[screaming]

18:38.952 --> 18:41.555
Ah, ya crazy kid, you! Ah!

18:43.289 --> 18:44.625
You nut!

18:44.658 --> 18:46.392
[laughs]

18:49.563 --> 18:50.731
Larry, isn’t this great?

18:50.764 --> 18:52.533
What a party
we’re going to have.

18:52.566 --> 18:56.402
It sure is. I can’t wait.
I’m gonna dance all night.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.404
What is it with you people?

18:58.438 --> 19:00.440
What are you talking about?

19:00.473 --> 19:03.276
Dancing? Partying?
Are you crazy?

19:03.309 --> 19:05.478
You should be ashamed
of yourselves!

19:05.512 --> 19:08.682
Talking like this when Mary Anne
only has a few days to live.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.420
I only have a few days to live?

19:16.322 --> 19:18.324
Why didn’t anyone tell me?

19:20.894 --> 19:23.363
Mary Anne,
you’re not going to die.

19:23.396 --> 19:24.731
What did you say to him?

19:24.765 --> 19:26.299
Well, I don’t know
what I said to him.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.268
But I didn’t use any
of the forbidden words.

19:30.671 --> 19:33.674
If Mary Anne...isn’t dying...

19:35.441 --> 19:37.243
...what are we talking about?

19:39.445 --> 19:41.848
We’re talking about
our wedding.

19:41.882 --> 19:43.750
Didn’t you just ask me
to marry you?

19:45.519 --> 19:48.354
I thought I just agreed
to oversee your burial.

19:51.692 --> 19:54.360
But then again, it’s been
a very confusing afternoon.

19:57.497 --> 20:00.466
Balki, it’s really
not confusing at all.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.769
I’m moving out of the house.

20:02.803 --> 20:04.971
Mary Anne,
I don’t want you to move out.

20:08.008 --> 20:10.276
If you want me to marry you...

20:11.912 --> 20:13.379
...I‐I will.

20:15.749 --> 20:18.985
You’d marry me
just to keep me from moving out?

20:19.019 --> 20:22.355
Sure, if it would
make you happy.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.992
Balki, marriage is something
that’s supposed

20:26.026 --> 20:28.929
to make both of us happy.

20:28.962 --> 20:31.632
I’ve been dropping hints for
months, but you never got it.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.901
And now I realize it’s because

20:34.935 --> 20:38.672
marriage is something
you haven’t even thought about.

20:38.705 --> 20:41.474
We seem to be headed
in two different directions.

20:43.076 --> 20:46.279
It’s better if I move out
and just get on with my life.

20:47.881 --> 20:50.617
[instrumental music]

20:55.989 --> 20:57.791
(Larry)
’We’re gonna miss you,
Mary Anne.’

21:07.333 --> 21:09.903
Well, um,
we’ll just let you say goodbye.

21:16.076 --> 21:18.478
I found this in my wallet.

21:18.512 --> 21:20.614
It’s your season pass
to the reptile farm.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.791
I’m gonna miss you.

21:30.824 --> 21:31.892
Me too.

21:33.627 --> 21:35.461
But we can still be friends.

21:36.496 --> 21:39.700
Yeah, we can.

21:39.733 --> 21:42.636
And‐and we can still go
to the reptile farm together.

21:44.971 --> 21:48.509
Yeah, we can.

21:48.542 --> 21:52.478
And if we can...if we
can still be friends...

21:52.513 --> 21:53.847
...then we can still make...

21:56.016 --> 21:58.952
...we can still make shadow
animals on the wall together.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.727
But friends can’t do that.

22:08.061 --> 22:09.596
No.

22:09.630 --> 22:11.698
No...no, they can’t.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.401
Goodbye, Balki.

22:21.107 --> 22:22.709
Goodbye, Mary Anne.

22:32.953 --> 22:35.556
[theme music]

23:03.550 --> 23:06.152
[music continues]
