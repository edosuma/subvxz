00:11.810 --> 00:14.722
I got your message about the wine club
and I'll be there.

00:15.022 --> 00:20.733
Dad's kicking me out of the house so
he and Sherry can have a little party.

00:22.154 --> 00:24.349
Life really is a circle, isn't it?

00:25.407 --> 00:29.480
Dad's using my place for a party
and just a few years ago,

00:29.828 --> 00:33.104
Dad would have to leave his house
for my parties.

00:33.415 --> 00:37.408
If you'd had any parties,
that would be filled with irony.

00:40.339 --> 00:43.570
Thank goodness you're here.
I've got some shocking news.

00:43.884 --> 00:44.873
What is it?

00:45.093 --> 00:47.926
I found a ring
in your father's underwear drawer.

00:48.221 --> 00:52.134
What on earth would leave a ring
around his underwear drawer?

00:58.231 --> 01:02.110
Not around, in.
An engagement ring in a jewellery box.

01:02.444 --> 01:06.483
Dad must be about to ask Sherry to
marry him. Do you know what that means?

01:06.823 --> 01:11.977
We're going to hear what Mendelssohn's
<i>Wedding March</i> sounds like on the banjo.

01:12.954 --> 01:16.026
It means she'll be our mother.
What are we going to do?

01:16.333 --> 01:19.609
There's nothing we can do, Niles.
It's what Dad wants.

01:19.920 --> 01:21.831
What'll we call her?

01:22.089 --> 01:24.478
I suppose she'll want us
to call her Mother.

01:24.758 --> 01:28.797
No, that's too formal.
No, Mama. No, Ma.

01:29.805 --> 01:32.877
Better still.
Don't you look nice, Ma.

01:33.183 --> 01:35.617
Yes, I'd love another corn dog, Ma.

01:37.646 --> 01:39.921
Off to the roller derby, Ma?

01:41.024 --> 01:44.812
That's typical of you two.
Your father is about to get married,

01:45.153 --> 01:48.350
and all you can think about
is how it will affect you.

01:48.657 --> 01:50.613
What about me?

01:50.867 --> 01:53.904
- What about you?
- Sherry's never exactly liked me.

01:54.204 --> 01:57.674
You don't think she'll try to make
your father get rid of me, do you?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.036
No, Daphne.
He'd be lost without you.

02:00.293 --> 02:04.286
Yes, and even if that were to happen,
I could always use you.

02:04.631 --> 02:10.342
I mean that I would know
of a position you could take that...

02:11.805 --> 02:13.796
Services that you could perform...

02:14.933 --> 02:16.924
I would know of an opening...

02:18.979 --> 02:20.970
This is on me.

02:23.317 --> 02:27.868
Marty, you need to stir the dip more.
It's got whole lumps of soup mix in it.

02:28.238 --> 02:29.512
Sorry.

02:33.577 --> 02:36.887
Quite the little shindig
you two are planning for tonight.

02:37.205 --> 02:39.799
You have the cheese logs.

02:42.502 --> 02:44.493
Erotic fortune cookies.

02:46.048 --> 02:48.357
For after dinner, a bloopers tape.

02:49.718 --> 02:51.709
<i>Too Hot for Hee-Haw.</i>

02:54.848 --> 02:58.682
I see that Martha Stewart party book
I gave you really paid off.

02:59.019 --> 03:01.374
This crowd
wouldn't go for froufrou stuff.

03:01.647 --> 03:05.196
Get them liquored up, put out some
corn nuts and they can go all night.

03:05.525 --> 03:09.757
- When you say all night...
- Here you go, smooth as silk.

03:10.113 --> 03:12.229
Who's attending this soirée?

03:12.491 --> 03:14.959
Just some old friends
I'm dying for Marty to meet.

03:15.243 --> 03:17.677
Now let's see,
there's Ray and Lola Sherwood.

03:17.954 --> 03:23.187
I worked with them in Atlantic City
when they had a knife-throwing act.

03:23.585 --> 03:26.941
Marty, try not to stare at her eye.
She gets self-conscious.

03:30.133 --> 03:32.124
And let's see.

03:32.970 --> 03:35.564
Edie's coming with her new fiancé.

03:35.847 --> 03:40.523
- She finally met him, huh?
- Just this week.

03:40.894 --> 03:43.362
They're engaged,
and they met this weekend?

03:43.647 --> 03:48.163
Well, up until now, it's been kind
of a pen-pal relationship. He's been...

03:48.527 --> 03:51.121
detained the last few years.

03:52.447 --> 03:54.836
You'll need some room
for those corn nuts.

03:55.117 --> 03:59.349
Why don't I just get this pesky
priceless sculpture out of your way?

03:59.705 --> 04:02.697
I never heard from Vic and Linda.
Did you get a message?

04:03.000 --> 04:06.276
- No.
- Maybe they left one on my machine.

04:07.796 --> 04:09.787
So what're you guys up to tonight?

04:15.095 --> 04:18.370
Our wine club is having
a vertical tasting of the Opus One.

04:18.682 --> 04:20.718
Well, don't drink too much.

04:20.976 --> 04:24.889
You don't drink the wine. You
just swish it around and spit it out.

04:25.230 --> 04:28.905
We all did that at Duke's
New Year's Eve party.

04:29.234 --> 04:31.429
Course it wasn't wine, it was egg salad.

04:34.573 --> 04:37.724
I just got a message
from my manager down at McGinty's.

04:38.035 --> 04:40.754
Some guy came in
asking questions about me.

04:41.038 --> 04:43.029
What kind of questions?

04:43.290 --> 04:45.929
Where I used to work,
the people I used to date,

04:46.209 --> 04:49.406
and my neighbour said somebody
asked her about me, too.

04:49.838 --> 04:52.591
- Somebody's checking up on you.
- Like a detective?

04:52.883 --> 04:56.273
It's probably a credit card company.
I wouldn't worry about it.

04:56.595 --> 04:59.393
It is a little scary.
I wish I knew who it was.

04:59.681 --> 05:02.400
Forget it, honey.
I've been through this before.

05:02.726 --> 05:05.365
Private investigators
never leave a trail.

05:05.646 --> 05:07.876
- It could be anyone.
- If you say so.

05:08.148 --> 05:12.141
- Which one of you hired him?
- That is just crazy.

05:12.527 --> 05:14.757
Who else would have the money
to do that?

05:15.030 --> 05:17.021
We had nothing to do with it.

05:17.282 --> 05:19.842
Do you think we'd
hire someone to spy on Sherry?

05:20.118 --> 05:22.996
- I'm insulted.
- As am I.

05:24.039 --> 05:27.190
- I jumped to the wrong conclusion.
- You certainly have.

05:27.501 --> 05:30.061
- I'm sorry, boys.
- It's all right, Dad.

05:30.337 --> 05:32.373
Just forget about it.

05:32.631 --> 05:34.826
You hired a detective? How could you?

05:35.092 --> 05:37.162
I have never been so insulted.

05:37.427 --> 05:40.544
OK, I'm sorry.
I'm just looking out for Dad here.

05:40.847 --> 05:42.997
What do we
really know about this woman?

05:43.266 --> 05:45.734
She makes Dad happy.
That's all we need to know.

05:46.019 --> 05:50.376
Some people get married before they know
all they should. Remember cousin Donald?

05:50.732 --> 05:54.805
He was married two years before
he found out his wife used to be a man.

05:55.153 --> 05:59.465
Cousin Donald is a rare case.
Most people don't have a hidden past.

05:59.825 --> 06:03.101
And most people have a better eye
for details than Donald.

06:03.412 --> 06:06.882
The woman could pick up
a watermelon with one hand.

06:09.501 --> 06:13.380
I was just simply trying to get
some background information.

06:13.714 --> 06:15.989
Well, stop it.

06:17.551 --> 06:20.304
- Call it off right now, Niles.
- Consider it done.

06:20.595 --> 06:22.984
- We've got to run.
- Yeah. Goodbye.

06:23.265 --> 06:26.382
Have a nice time, you two.
We'll save you some cake.

06:26.685 --> 06:29.324
Thank you.
You see that, how sweet she is?

06:29.604 --> 06:34.200
I can't believe you're having her
investigated. Try trusting people.

06:40.657 --> 06:44.650
- Quick, is someone following me?
- Yes, here comes Lady Law now.

06:44.995 --> 06:48.305
Excuse me, ma'am,
I saw you cross against the light.

06:48.623 --> 06:50.773
I'm going to have to write you a ticket.

06:51.043 --> 06:54.638
I'm really sorry about that.
It's just that it's so cold out there,

06:54.963 --> 06:59.195
and the pollution, and I didn't
want to expose my unborn child

06:59.551 --> 07:01.940
to the elements any longer
than I needed to.

07:02.220 --> 07:06.577
You're pregnant.
I know a little bit about that myself.

07:06.933 --> 07:09.970
Then you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

07:10.270 --> 07:13.706
Society doesn't go easy
on pregnant ladies, does it?

07:14.024 --> 07:16.219
So when are you due?

07:16.485 --> 07:19.363
I'm not pregnant.

07:22.658 --> 07:25.047
That's Roz Doyle.

07:25.327 --> 07:27.636
Do you want to step over here, please?

07:29.998 --> 07:33.354
- Hello, Niles.
- Hello, Frasier. May I borrow your pen?

07:33.669 --> 07:35.944
Certainly. How do you do?

07:36.797 --> 07:38.788
I appreciate all your hard work

07:39.049 --> 07:42.519
and I am sorry to have to break off
the investigation in the middle.

07:42.844 --> 07:45.404
People change their minds all the time.

07:45.681 --> 07:47.797
I'm sure they do. There you are.

07:48.058 --> 07:50.492
Thank you. Goodbye.

07:52.187 --> 07:55.941
- There, now don't you feel better?
- I suppose so.

07:56.274 --> 07:58.390
You have to admit
I was right on this one.

07:58.652 --> 08:02.281
You had no justification
for giving in to your baser instincts

08:02.614 --> 08:04.923
and prying into Sherry's past.

08:05.200 --> 08:09.318
I almost forgot. I wrote up a little
report on what I found out so far.

08:09.663 --> 08:12.177
That's one interesting lady.

08:18.755 --> 08:21.189
I should've told him
to drop it in the trash.

08:21.466 --> 08:23.741
We're concerned with Dad's happiness.

08:24.011 --> 08:28.880
Sometimes you are like a beacon,
piercing the fog of my baser instincts.

08:29.266 --> 08:32.178
- Miss, would you drop that in the...
- Give me that.

08:34.187 --> 08:37.496
You've proven your point.
I hate myself for what I'm doing.

08:37.816 --> 08:40.250
We're doing it for Dad's own good.

08:40.652 --> 08:43.530
So far, so good.

08:44.573 --> 08:46.882
Graduated from high school.

08:48.493 --> 08:50.484
Almost paid off her Subaru.

08:51.413 --> 08:54.803
- Did you know she'd been married?
- Yes, she mentioned that.

08:55.125 --> 08:57.116
To Johnny Dempsey.

08:57.377 --> 09:02.132
There were two others:
Ned Foley, Marc Wallace.

09:02.507 --> 09:05.783
That's a bit troubling.
Three previous marriages?

09:06.845 --> 09:08.836
Vincent Mayhew.

09:09.931 --> 09:12.491
Milton Mandell.

09:13.977 --> 09:16.093
- Walt...
- Just give me the total.

09:16.355 --> 09:17.834
Six. That we know of.

09:18.065 --> 09:21.978
You had to go and fire that
detective before he finished his report.

09:22.319 --> 09:24.310
Six husbands.

09:25.739 --> 09:29.049
She's obviously incapable
of remaining in a relationship.

09:29.368 --> 09:31.438
Doesn't bode well for the marriage.

09:31.703 --> 09:35.696
On the upside, it does bode well for Dad
getting a "yes" when he proposes.

09:37.125 --> 09:39.275
He has a right to know about this.

09:39.544 --> 09:42.661
We told him we weren't
involved in the investigation.

09:42.965 --> 09:47.004
Maybe we can impart the information
without explaining how we came by it.

09:47.344 --> 09:50.495
- Drop it in the conversation.
- And how would that go?

09:50.806 --> 09:54.355
"Dad, going to the Sherry
Ex-Husband Convention this year?"

09:56.144 --> 09:58.180
Besides, Dad may know already.

09:58.438 --> 10:00.508
I think we need to find that out.

10:00.774 --> 10:05.723
What if Dad marries her and in a year
he's tossed aside like Danny Mitchell?

10:06.113 --> 10:09.105
- Who's that?
- Page five. Engaged, but never married.

10:13.745 --> 10:15.701
- Hey, boys.
- Hey, Dad.

10:15.956 --> 10:20.746
What do you think about this jacket?
Something doesn't quite feel right.

10:21.128 --> 10:23.164
- I think it's nice.
- Really?

10:23.422 --> 10:25.811
Dad, I was talking with a lady today.

10:26.091 --> 10:29.606
I happened to mention
that I had been married twice before.

10:29.928 --> 10:34.365
A look clouded over her face as if
I had confessed to some unspeakable sin.

10:35.350 --> 10:40.424
And people who've been married more
than that. Quite a taboo they face.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.930
I don't know. It's so...

10:43.191 --> 10:46.627
I think it all harkens back
to the puritanical streak

10:46.945 --> 10:50.301
that still runs through this country.
What do you think?

10:50.615 --> 10:54.767
There's a yakety-yak streak
that runs through this family.

10:55.454 --> 10:57.729
Maybe it's the shirt.
You like this shirt?

10:57.998 --> 10:59.556
Yes, it's nice.

10:59.791 --> 11:02.464
Might make a good topic
to discuss on my show.

11:02.753 --> 11:06.109
The hurdles that are faced
by people with multiple marriages.

11:06.423 --> 11:11.577
Hard to round up enough people
who've been married a lot of times.

11:11.970 --> 11:13.961
- Do you know anyone?
- No, I don't.

11:14.222 --> 11:16.417
Mrs Kranz upstairs...

11:18.226 --> 11:21.377
- How about you, Dad?
- Sure, I know some people.

11:21.688 --> 11:23.280
Really, you do?

11:23.523 --> 11:25.081
- I think.
- You think?

11:25.317 --> 11:27.911
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.
I hate this shirt.

11:28.195 --> 11:30.186
I've got to change this shirt.

11:32.449 --> 11:36.237
- That was fruitless.
- I'll tell you one thing I'm sure of.

11:37.663 --> 11:39.381
Yes?

11:39.623 --> 11:42.183
Oh, I'm allowed to talk now, am I?

11:45.170 --> 11:47.365
I've never seen your father so nervous.

11:47.631 --> 11:51.306
He's meeting Sherry
and I bet he'll pop the question.

11:51.635 --> 11:54.672
- We have to tell him.
- But we don't know what he knows.

11:54.972 --> 11:57.406
If she'd told him
she'd been married six times,

11:57.683 --> 12:00.641
- he would remember.
- Who, Sherry?

12:00.936 --> 12:04.008
Maybe this shirt isn't so bad
with this new jacket.

12:04.314 --> 12:06.748
- What do you think of this jacket?
- It's nice.

12:07.025 --> 12:09.778
Sherry's been married six times?

12:10.070 --> 12:13.346
- Who told you that?
- They did.

12:18.954 --> 12:20.945
What's this all about?

12:21.206 --> 12:24.801
I'd love to see the first shirt
with the second jacket.

12:25.127 --> 12:28.517
You got this from the investigator.
You did hire him.

12:28.839 --> 12:33.037
I guess there's no use in denying it.
Yes, we did hire him.

12:33.385 --> 12:36.775
Although the word "we"
is not entirely accurate.

12:37.097 --> 12:40.134
- Frasier, I am shocked that...
- Shut up, Niles.

12:42.853 --> 12:48.644
Dad, we were just concerned about you.
We know about the engagement ring.

12:49.067 --> 12:52.377
- Who went through my drawers?
- Pointing fingers won't help.

12:52.696 --> 12:55.130
- What's the matter with you?
- She did it.

12:59.036 --> 13:02.711
It's nice to know there isn't a
single person in this house I can trust.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.871
Sherry told me about her marriages.

13:05.125 --> 13:08.117
I didn't tell you because
it's none of your damn business,

13:08.420 --> 13:12.095
just like it's none of your business
who I marry or who I don't marry.

13:12.424 --> 13:15.939
I don't know why
I'm even wasting my time talking to you.

13:16.261 --> 13:19.253
See what I get
for confiding in you two blabbermouths.

13:19.556 --> 13:22.912
Next time I find something
in your father's underwear drawer,

13:23.226 --> 13:25.296
I'm just going to sit on it.

13:27.000 --> 13:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:34.404 --> 13:36.395
This evening is an entire disaster.

13:37.366 --> 13:42.394
I'm already late for dinner with Maris.
I don't know how this could've happened.

13:42.788 --> 13:47.225
Who'd have guessed that something so
innocent as spying on a man's girlfriend

13:47.584 --> 13:51.577
and rifling his underwear drawer
could turn so ugly?

13:52.631 --> 13:57.830
There is one consolation. We told Dad
the truth and could bear his anger.

13:58.220 --> 14:02.179
That's the nice thing about
our relationship. We're all adults.

14:02.516 --> 14:05.588
We're not afraid of confrontation.

14:05.894 --> 14:09.011
Stop stalling, Niles.
Dad must be in the elevator by now.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.675
Look what I found
in your father's jacket.

14:13.944 --> 14:16.412
- I do not want to know.
- He forgot the ring.

14:16.697 --> 14:18.688
This will be embarrassing for him.

14:18.949 --> 14:22.658
- I suppose I could take it down to him.
- No, Daphne, I should do that.

14:22.995 --> 14:26.465
It'll give me an excellent opportunity
to show him how happy I am

14:26.790 --> 14:29.588
- that he's marrying Sherry.
- That would be nice.

14:29.876 --> 14:33.994
I can't figure out why he would propose
in McGinty's.

14:34.339 --> 14:36.853
It's so shabby.

14:37.134 --> 14:40.171
Well, I guess maybe
he was just trying to match the ring.

14:45.309 --> 14:49.860
So I told her that you and l
would take a trip up there this spring.

14:50.230 --> 14:53.063
- Well, you like my sister, right?
- Yeah, sure.

14:53.358 --> 14:57.033
You can't hold
one embarrassing moment against her.

14:57.362 --> 14:59.512
She didn't know you were in there.

15:01.116 --> 15:03.869
No, I don't. No, I like your sister.

15:04.619 --> 15:07.770
Well, then what is wrong with you?
You're being so quiet.

15:08.081 --> 15:11.676
- I got something on my mind.
- Well, what is it?

15:12.961 --> 15:15.759
I've been thinking
a lot about us, and...

15:18.133 --> 15:20.488
Where do you see us going?

15:20.761 --> 15:24.231
I don't know. I mean,
I'm having fun the way things are.

15:24.556 --> 15:27.514
You have your life, I have mine.
No pressure.

15:28.101 --> 15:29.819
That's what I thought you'd say.

15:30.062 --> 15:32.417
Is there something wrong
with having fun?

15:32.689 --> 15:37.444
No. We've been just having fun
for a long time now.

15:37.819 --> 15:43.496
Let me ask you something. Where
do you see us in a year? Five years?

15:47.162 --> 15:50.393
I don't know.
I try not to look too far ahead.

15:50.707 --> 15:53.426
That's the difference between us.

15:54.878 --> 15:57.597
Because I can't stop thinking
that far ahead.

16:01.259 --> 16:07.095
I've come to realise, Sherry,
that I want to get married again.

16:08.517 --> 16:11.987
And, you know, that's
not anything that you're interested in.

16:12.813 --> 16:17.887
Well, can you blame me?
I mean, Marty, you know my track record.

16:18.276 --> 16:21.951
I've been down that road a lot of times.

16:25.283 --> 16:28.275
I've learned the hard way.
I'm not looking for forever.

16:28.578 --> 16:30.330
Well...

16:32.124 --> 16:33.557
I am.

16:34.126 --> 16:36.560
So you're breaking up with me?

16:38.588 --> 16:42.547
We're just looking for different things,
Sherry. I'm sorry.

16:46.555 --> 16:49.069
- It's hot in here.
- Yeah.

16:57.107 --> 17:00.417
Dad, fancy seeing you here.
Can I speak with you for a second?

17:00.736 --> 17:02.727
Will you get out of here?

17:02.988 --> 17:06.946
I've got something you might want
before you tell Sherry...

17:07.284 --> 17:10.037
He's already told me.

17:10.329 --> 17:12.365
He has?

17:12.622 --> 17:16.455
Well, that is just wonderful.
And may I say, it's about time.

17:17.294 --> 17:20.205
- I couldn't be happier for you.
- That's nice to know.

17:20.505 --> 17:26.215
Dad, I'd like you to know that
everybody is 100% behind this decision.

17:26.637 --> 17:30.789
I'm so glad that you're so happy
your father is breaking up with me.

17:32.225 --> 17:34.659
Breaking up?

17:38.440 --> 17:40.431
I had no idea.

17:40.692 --> 17:44.890
And you get paid to help people
through their difficult moments in life?

17:51.203 --> 17:53.194
It isn't easy saying goodbye, is it?

17:53.455 --> 17:58.449
No. It doesn't get any easier either.
I should know.

18:00.045 --> 18:04.994
Listen, Marty, this is usually the time
people say, "Well, let's be friends".

18:05.384 --> 18:11.016
And then there's a phone call or two,
but they never see each other again.

18:12.933 --> 18:18.565
Well, I just want you to know that I am
around for you if you ever get lonely

18:18.981 --> 18:22.132
or you just need to talk.

18:26.822 --> 18:27.811
Thanks.

18:30.951 --> 18:33.909
And when you call,
if a man answers, hang up.

18:55.183 --> 18:56.172
Hi, Dad.

18:58.020 --> 19:00.454
Obviously I came down here
to bring you this.

19:02.399 --> 19:05.994
Obviously I made another
colossal blunder in a week full of them.

19:07.904 --> 19:09.895
I'm really sorry, Dad.

19:12.534 --> 19:15.765
I guess you don't really
feel like talking, huh?

19:16.079 --> 19:21.836
You know, Frasier, sometimes I just
feel like sitting and watching a game.

19:23.754 --> 19:27.190
Fine. I can do that.
Yeah. Sure.

19:30.052 --> 19:33.089
Well, so the Sonics and...

19:34.097 --> 19:35.086
Bulls.

19:36.475 --> 19:39.114
That Jordan,
he's really something, huh? Yeah.

19:40.937 --> 19:43.326
The way he scores those points

19:46.026 --> 19:48.904
and gets the ball back
when the other team misses.

19:50.238 --> 19:54.356
That's incredible. He made
the same impossible shot twice in a row.

19:54.701 --> 19:57.010
It's the instant replay.

20:02.250 --> 20:05.367
You know, I was carrying this thing
around for a month.

20:05.671 --> 20:07.901
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:09.675 --> 20:15.625
But at the end of every night,
I just couldn't pop the question.

20:18.684 --> 20:22.279
And then I realised it was because
I knew what the answer would be.

20:23.605 --> 20:25.641
She didn't want to get married again.

20:27.651 --> 20:30.006
- I'm sorry, Dad.
- It's all right.

20:30.278 --> 20:34.510
Maybe it wouldn't have
worked out between us anyway.

20:34.866 --> 20:36.584
Your mom's a hard act to follow.

20:39.371 --> 20:42.090
I never went through
anything like this with her.

20:43.709 --> 20:48.339
We knew we were meant to be together.
And that was that.

20:51.008 --> 20:52.999
It's hard to find that out there.

20:54.469 --> 20:56.744
I've been trying for a while.

20:59.266 --> 21:01.826
You'll get there.

21:04.187 --> 21:06.223
Hope we both do.

21:07.607 --> 21:09.598
You know, Dad, in time...

21:16.366 --> 21:19.324
That was quite a shot.

21:19.619 --> 21:21.814
Yeah, Payton's been pretty hot lately.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.640
- What's the score?
- Sonics are down by five.

21:24.916 --> 21:27.066
Got a chance if they can hold Jordan.

21:27.336 --> 21:30.294
- Can I get a beer here, please?
- Yeah, make that two.
