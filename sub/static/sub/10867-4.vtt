00:29.447 --> 00:32.408
Okay, from now on,
whoever gets here late,

00:32.408 --> 00:35.327
has to lug the
firewood for a month.

00:35.327 --> 00:36.913
She's not even late yet.

00:36.913 --> 00:38.873
Oh.
She will be.

00:38.873 --> 00:43.085
In five seconds Megan
gets a month of hard labor.

00:43.085 --> 00:47.131
Five... four... three... two...

00:47.131 --> 00:48.674
Sorry guys!

00:48.674 --> 00:50.509
This is way
heavier than I thought.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.261
Getting out here took forever.

00:52.261 --> 00:54.680
One second short of forever.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.723
Huh?

00:55.723 --> 00:57.182
Don't worry about it.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.851
Whatcha got?

00:58.851 --> 01:00.937
Oh it's for my story.
Could you put it by the chair?

01:00.937 --> 01:02.939
Thanks.

01:02.939 --> 01:05.984
I've got a story about artists,
and the amazing things

01:05.984 --> 01:08.235
that they create.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.949
That's pretty low on
the amazing scale.

01:12.949 --> 01:14.241
But it isn't.

01:14.241 --> 01:17.912
To us, this is just
a chunk of marble.

01:17.912 --> 01:22.041
But to an artist, there's a
beautiful creation inside,

01:22.041 --> 01:25.252
waiting to be released.

01:25.837 --> 01:27.129
Yeah...

01:27.129 --> 01:29.298
this could turn out
to be... anything!

01:29.298 --> 01:31.926
It's the same thing with
a blank piece of paper

01:31.926 --> 01:33.761
or an empty canvas.

01:33.761 --> 01:36.221
It's the vision of the artist
that turns a piece of nothing,

01:36.221 --> 01:39.517
into something special.

01:39.517 --> 01:41.477
That's what my story's about.

01:41.477 --> 01:43.228
When an artist
creates something,

01:43.228 --> 01:45.481
they put so much
thought and care,

01:45.481 --> 01:49.276
so much of themselves into it,
it's almost as if they're giving

01:49.276 --> 01:51.153
their work... life.

01:51.153 --> 01:56.034
And where's there's
life, there's emotion.

01:56.034 --> 02:00.162
What if a statue
could be happy, or sad,

02:00.162 --> 02:01.362
or lonely or even angry?

02:06.418 --> 02:10.172
Submitted for the approval
of The Midnight Society,

02:10.172 --> 02:13.968
I call this story...

03:01.515 --> 03:03.851
Game point!

03:15.696 --> 03:17.531
Game point!
Say goodnight, folks!

03:17.531 --> 03:18.991
Good game!
Good game!

03:18.991 --> 03:20.952
The Dynamic Duo strikes again!

03:20.952 --> 03:21.953
Kevin.

03:21.953 --> 03:24.038
Oh, right.
We got lucky.

03:24.038 --> 03:25.998
Gimme a break.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.792
You're right, we
kicked your butts.

03:27.792 --> 03:28.792
Hey!

03:30.878 --> 03:32.130
Hey, I'm dying of thirst here.

03:32.130 --> 03:33.589
Who wants a soda?

03:33.589 --> 03:35.007
Hey man we'll get
'em, losers walk.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.592
Oh no.
We're not spoiled winners.

03:36.592 --> 03:37.593
It's on us.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.137
I'll come with you.

03:39.137 --> 03:40.387
Use the time to practice.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.680
That means volleyball.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.348
Ha ha.

03:50.982 --> 03:51.982
Hey!

03:53.192 --> 03:56.112
Come on make some funny faces.

03:57.071 --> 04:00.199
Great!
Great!

04:00.199 --> 04:02.868
Enough pictures, stop.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.428
No, one more!

04:23.681 --> 04:24.681
Hey!

04:26.558 --> 04:28.102
What was that?

04:28.102 --> 04:29.436
What?

04:29.436 --> 04:30.562
I thought I heard...

04:30.562 --> 04:32.731
It's nothing, let's go.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.483
Wait, I wanna talk to you.

04:34.483 --> 04:37.820
Uh oh, this sounds serious.

04:39.905 --> 04:42.491
Are we having dinner with
your parents tonight or not?

04:42.491 --> 04:45.786
Oh, yeah, my dad...

04:45.786 --> 04:47.412
I forgot my dad had
to go out of town

04:47.412 --> 04:49.456
on business and Mom's
having friends over.

04:49.456 --> 04:52.251
So...
another time.

04:52.251 --> 04:54.336
Hey what?

04:54.336 --> 04:56.714
Well don't you think it's kinda
weird I haven't met them yet?

04:56.714 --> 04:58.590
We've been together
for three months now.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.177
You'll meet 'em, it's just
gotta be the right time.

05:01.177 --> 05:02.344
Why?

05:02.344 --> 05:04.429
Well...

05:04.429 --> 05:06.515
they're not used
to people like you.

05:06.515 --> 05:09.393
What do you mean "like me"!?

05:10.144 --> 05:12.146
That came out wrong.

05:12.146 --> 05:13.647
It's just that they're
so straight.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.191
They don't get arty types.

05:15.191 --> 05:17.693
What, I've got an eye in
the middle of my forehead?

05:17.693 --> 05:19.070
C'mon, don't overreact...

05:19.070 --> 05:20.738
I'm not overreacting
Kevin, this is serious.

05:20.738 --> 05:23.115
It's like you're ashamed
of me or something.

05:23.115 --> 05:24.825
I'm not, but, you're different.

05:24.825 --> 05:25.826
And that's bad?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.161
No, but...

05:27.161 --> 05:29.914
it makes it hard Julie.

05:29.914 --> 05:32.499
Well then, being with
me is just so hard,

05:32.499 --> 05:34.168
maybe we shouldn't
be together at all!

05:34.168 --> 05:35.544
I didn't say that Julie.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.171
But that's how you feel.
-C'mon...

05:37.171 --> 05:38.589
No, Kevin. I'm tired

05:38.589 --> 05:40.758
of feeling like I'm not
good enough for you.

05:40.758 --> 05:42.718
So what are you saying?

05:42.718 --> 05:45.637
I'm saying maybe we
should take a time out here,

05:45.637 --> 05:48.099
to figure out where we're going.

05:48.099 --> 05:50.309
I don't believe this.

05:50.309 --> 05:53.104
If that's the way
you feel, fine.

05:53.104 --> 05:55.147
But this isn't my choice.

05:55.147 --> 05:56.607
It's not mine either.

05:56.607 --> 05:58.901
Well yeah, it is!

06:33.227 --> 06:37.856
Okay, could
things get any worse?

06:53.538 --> 06:55.749
Thanks.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.473
I shouldn't have done that.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.392
[clattering]
Julie?

07:13.851 --> 07:14.571
Julie?

07:20.858 --> 07:25.237
Oh this is bad.

07:26.030 --> 07:27.198
Whoa!

07:27.198 --> 07:29.200
Who are YOU looking at?

07:29.200 --> 07:31.451
Back off man.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.531
Back off!

07:38.125 --> 07:40.419
You broke up?

07:40.419 --> 07:42.213
Just now?

07:42.213 --> 07:44.882
But you guys are like
made for each other!

07:44.882 --> 07:48.760
Yeah, I thought so
too but, Kevin doesn't.

07:48.760 --> 07:52.139
He's gotta come back this
way, his pack's still here.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.640
I'm gonna go find him.
-He's probably at the snack bar.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.976
What for half an hour??

07:55.976 --> 07:59.813
No, I'll find him.

08:03.525 --> 08:04.985
I don't think he's here.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.404
He must have gone home.

08:06.404 --> 08:09.531
What do you want to do?

08:09.531 --> 08:11.700
Let's just... go.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.870
Uh... Maybe you should
call him tonight,

08:14.870 --> 08:19.124
now that you're
cooled off and all.

08:19.124 --> 08:22.502
Yeah, maybe.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.102
Yes.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.229
Doctor Tyler?

08:40.229 --> 08:41.480
This is Julie Hart.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.523
Kevin's friend?

08:43.523 --> 08:45.025
What can I do for you?

08:45.025 --> 08:47.111
Could I speak to him?
-Isn't he with you?

08:47.111 --> 08:48.153
Is that Kevin?

08:48.153 --> 08:49.363
Where is he?

08:49.363 --> 08:50.948
It's his little friend.

08:50.948 --> 08:53.575
We were at the park
together but he left before me.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.535
He didn't say where
he was going?

08:55.535 --> 08:57.329
Well... no.

08:57.329 --> 08:58.497
He's not home?

08:58.497 --> 08:59.790
What is it?
What's wrong?

08:59.790 --> 09:02.084
No, and he's very late.

09:02.084 --> 09:04.586
Could you ask him to
call me when he gets in?

09:04.586 --> 09:06.171
He'll have to
speak to you tomorrow,

09:06.171 --> 09:07.672
he's already well past curfew.

09:07.672 --> 09:11.343
Oh, okay, thanks.
Goodnight.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.188
Any news?

10:04.188 --> 10:04.938
No.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.566
It's like he dropped off
the face of the earth...

10:07.566 --> 10:09.109
no one has seen him.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.402
I'm sure he's okay.

10:10.402 --> 10:11.695
What if something
happened to him?

10:11.695 --> 10:13.280
Hey, heads up.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.032
It's the Tylers.

10:15.032 --> 10:16.658
It's all right honey.

10:20.829 --> 10:23.541
Dr. and Mrs. Tyler, I'm Julie.

10:23.541 --> 10:24.875
Where is my son?

10:24.875 --> 10:26.585
I don't know.

10:26.585 --> 10:28.212
He hasn't been the
same since he met you,

10:28.212 --> 10:29.505
young lady.

10:29.505 --> 10:31.006
If you had anything
to do with this...

10:31.006 --> 10:33.217
Honey, honey...
This won't solve anything.

10:33.217 --> 10:34.843
C'mon.

10:34.843 --> 10:38.138
I want to find him
as much as you do.

11:03.581 --> 11:04.915
[crack]

11:16.385 --> 11:17.677
Ahhhhh!!!

11:17.677 --> 11:19.012
Ahaaaa!!

11:33.735 --> 11:34.985
Wait!

11:36.238 --> 11:37.448
Leave me alone!

11:37.448 --> 11:39.283
I-I-I won't hurt you!

11:39.283 --> 11:40.618
It's okay!

11:40.618 --> 11:41.619
What do you want?

11:41.619 --> 11:42.661
Your friend!

11:42.661 --> 11:44.037
I know where he is!

11:44.037 --> 11:44.757
Kevin?

11:46.039 --> 11:47.541
Where is he?

11:47.541 --> 11:50.502
I'll take you to him...

11:54.423 --> 11:58.260
Don't be afraid, please.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.186
There...
see for yourself.

12:29.625 --> 12:33.044
This is not funny.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.548
Who are you?

12:36.548 --> 12:38.592
Well I'm...

12:38.592 --> 12:40.469
The Protector.

12:40.469 --> 12:44.222
I bring the message...

12:44.222 --> 12:47.225
We must follow the 4 Rs.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.521
Reduce.
Reuse.

12:50.521 --> 12:54.232
Recycle and recover.

12:54.232 --> 12:56.151
I saw you, in the picture!

12:56.151 --> 12:58.987
You were watching us!

12:58.987 --> 13:00.531
Where is Kevin???

13:00.531 --> 13:02.658
Well, there!

13:02.658 --> 13:05.285
That's him!

13:05.285 --> 13:07.496
He turned to stone!

13:07.496 --> 13:08.346
I saw it, myself!

13:11.750 --> 13:12.792
Yeah right.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.252
It's true!

13:14.252 --> 13:16.087
Look.

13:16.087 --> 13:19.466
He drank the water - and then...

13:19.466 --> 13:23.721
it, well, it just happened.

13:30.519 --> 13:31.562
You're crazy.

13:31.562 --> 13:33.480
Maybe, a little...

13:33.480 --> 13:37.442
but I'm telling the truth...

13:37.442 --> 13:41.154
and I-I saw who did it to him.

13:52.457 --> 13:53.792
He was right here...

13:53.792 --> 13:54.876
he took a drink...

13:54.876 --> 13:56.670
and then he looked sick...

13:56.670 --> 13:59.673
I tried to help him, but
he-he just got up and,

13:59.673 --> 14:01.091
and he ran.

14:01.091 --> 14:06.430
And then you saw what happened.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.444
Why are you
making up this story?

14:20.444 --> 14:21.404
I'm not!

14:23.321 --> 14:24.782
She-she did this to him.

14:24.782 --> 14:26.784
It's her fault!

14:26.784 --> 14:31.830
Look I wish I didn't
see it, but I did.

14:36.251 --> 14:40.255
The Stone Maiden
by Vivian White.

14:41.298 --> 14:44.718
Why would I lie?

15:04.946 --> 15:10.285
I don't know whose
nuttier, me or you.

15:10.285 --> 15:12.621
That-that would be me.

15:12.621 --> 15:13.701
Ha ha ha.

15:22.631 --> 15:23.351
Hello!

15:24.883 --> 15:27.093
Is anyone here?

15:27.093 --> 15:30.221
Can I help you?

15:32.056 --> 15:35.143
Vivian White?

15:35.143 --> 15:39.356
My name's Julie and
this is The Pro...

15:39.356 --> 15:41.941
what's your real name.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.234
I never tell.

15:43.234 --> 15:44.361
Make an exception.

15:44.361 --> 15:45.081
Henry.

15:47.238 --> 15:50.033
And this is Henry.

15:50.033 --> 15:53.704
Look, I know this is going to
sound completely ridiculous.

15:53.704 --> 15:56.748
But, you know your
statue in the park...

15:56.748 --> 15:58.500
The Stone Maiden?

15:58.500 --> 16:04.923
Well, Henry says it turned
my boyfriend into stone.

16:04.923 --> 16:09.469
Look, I'm sorry, we'll go now.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.054
Wait.

16:11.054 --> 16:15.559
Turning people to stone,
is exactly what she does.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.815
Amazing.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.817
Recycling as art!

16:23.817 --> 16:26.528
Ha ha!
This is incredible!

16:26.528 --> 16:29.614
I made the Stone Maiden, years
ago when I was depressed

16:29.614 --> 16:31.825
about not having any
romance in my life.

16:31.825 --> 16:35.579
Ha ha.
Still looking.

16:35.579 --> 16:40.083
The legend of The Stone Maiden
dates back to ancient Greece.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.669
It's a tragic romance about a
young couple whose families

16:42.669 --> 16:45.964
didn't approve of
their relationship.

16:45.964 --> 16:51.052
So, rather than be torn apart,
she found a potion that would

16:51.052 --> 16:53.221
turn them both into stone.

16:53.221 --> 16:56.808
Their love was so strong
that they chose to be together

16:56.808 --> 17:00.270
forever as statues, rather than
spend the rest of their lives

17:00.270 --> 17:02.021
apart.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.356
Oh here here look!

17:03.356 --> 17:05.316
I based the statue
on this very sketch.

17:05.316 --> 17:06.568
That's it!

17:06.568 --> 17:07.778
But who's that?

17:07.778 --> 17:09.946
Her young lover, of course.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.781
Why didn't you sculpt him too?

17:11.781 --> 17:14.075
Well...
I did.

17:14.075 --> 17:15.827
Are we talking
about the same statue?

17:15.827 --> 17:18.162
Yeah that's her,
but she's alone.

17:18.162 --> 17:21.332
There's no boy statue.

17:23.627 --> 17:24.752
No...

17:24.752 --> 17:26.630
No!
You can't do that!

17:26.630 --> 17:28.298
I don't care what
your reasons are,

17:28.298 --> 17:29.382
that's my WORK!

17:29.382 --> 17:30.341
I demand that you...

17:30.341 --> 17:33.511
hello?
Hello?

17:33.511 --> 17:34.596
Bureaucrats!

17:34.596 --> 17:35.806
They hung up on me.

17:35.806 --> 17:37.223
What did they say?

17:37.223 --> 17:40.018
They sold half my statue
to a park in New York...

17:40.018 --> 17:42.562
to balance their budget!

17:42.562 --> 17:45.106
I can't stand it!

17:45.106 --> 17:46.817
That's like... that's
like tearing up

17:46.817 --> 17:48.693
the Mona Lisa for postcards!

17:48.693 --> 17:50.946
Well, at least it still works.

17:50.946 --> 17:52.196
What do you mean?

17:52.196 --> 17:53.740
The water pump,
they didn't break it.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.034
There's no water
pump in my statue.

17:56.034 --> 17:58.202
Yes there is, water
pours out of her vase.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.871
I saw it.

17:59.871 --> 18:03.750
I promise you Julie, there is
no water pump in my statue!

18:03.750 --> 18:06.544
Uh, excuse me.

18:06.544 --> 18:09.380
I know you don't
believe me, but it's true.

18:09.380 --> 18:12.634
There is water
and Kevin drank it.

18:12.634 --> 18:14.719
That's when he turned to stone.

18:14.719 --> 18:17.430
Now, isn't that what
happens in the legend?

18:17.430 --> 18:19.933
Yes, but it's just a story.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.726
Maybe.

18:21.726 --> 18:25.313
Or maybe the statue doesn't
like to be apart from its mate!

18:25.313 --> 18:31.444
If she gets him back, then
maybe she'll let Kevin go.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.990
Let's put 'em back together.

18:34.990 --> 18:37.034
Look lady, it's not my decision.

18:37.034 --> 18:38.618
The statue's on the way out.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.496
half a statue, I donated a
whole statue to this park.

18:41.496 --> 18:42.873
Look here's the agreement.

18:42.873 --> 18:44.708
It clearly states that
the Statue cannot be

18:44.708 --> 18:46.626
cut up and sold piecemeal.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.796
Well, yeah it can
cause, there it goes.

18:52.716 --> 18:53.800
Wha...

18:53.800 --> 18:56.511
How dare you.

18:56.511 --> 18:59.305
Hey! Hey!
That's my bike!

19:13.070 --> 19:16.114
Are you crazy?
He coulda killed you!

19:16.114 --> 19:18.449
You can't take that statue,
you've gotta put it back.

19:18.449 --> 19:19.993
This thing is booked on
a train to New York

19:19.993 --> 19:22.746
in twenty minutes,
it ain't gonna be late.

19:22.746 --> 19:24.789
Get on the truck.
-No, you can't!

19:24.789 --> 19:27.250
Look they made a mistake okay.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.252
The statue never should have
been sold in the first place.

19:29.252 --> 19:31.129
Why don't you put it back.

19:31.129 --> 19:34.465
We can't do that, I've got a
signed order here that says

19:34.465 --> 19:35.926
that this thing has got...
[tires screeching]

19:35.926 --> 19:37.246
Hey!!
Hey!!!

19:48.646 --> 19:49.647
Put it back.

19:49.647 --> 19:50.732
Back in the truck.

19:50.732 --> 19:52.442
Oh go away.

19:52.442 --> 19:55.153
Remarkable.

19:55.153 --> 19:59.032
I wouldn't drink that.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.992
Look, we're just
gonna take it away again.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.493
Oh no you are not!

20:02.493 --> 20:05.580
That statue remains intact.

20:06.205 --> 20:06.925
Julie!

20:08.792 --> 20:09.918
What is this?

20:09.918 --> 20:11.502
What are we doing out here?

20:11.502 --> 20:13.588
Where is Kevin?

20:13.588 --> 20:15.506
Look, I don't know
how to say this.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.842
And I'm not even sure I
understand it myself,

20:17.842 --> 20:20.929
but we think something happened
to Kevin because he drank

20:20.929 --> 20:22.221
the water from this fountain.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.222
What?

20:23.222 --> 20:24.141
He's poisoned?

20:24.141 --> 20:25.516
No!
Not exactly.

20:25.516 --> 20:27.435
Julie!

20:34.317 --> 20:37.904
There ain't no water
pump in that statue.

20:39.990 --> 20:43.367
Henry:
She got her boyfriend back.

20:44.535 --> 20:46.913
The spell is broken!

20:46.913 --> 20:48.289
Ha ha ha ha!

20:48.289 --> 20:49.791
But where's Kevin?

20:49.791 --> 20:51.626
Julie!

20:51.626 --> 20:54.587
Kevin? Kevin!

21:00.802 --> 21:02.428
It didn't work.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.763
It was just a story!

21:03.763 --> 21:05.056
I want answers young lady!

21:05.056 --> 21:06.390
NOW!

21:08.768 --> 21:09.853
I'm sorry.

21:09.853 --> 21:12.772
I was wrong.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.398
I don't care what your
parents think about me,

21:14.398 --> 21:15.692
or of us.

21:15.692 --> 21:21.405
We may be different
but, we belong together.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.992
I love you.

21:23.992 --> 21:27.537
Please Kevin, come back to me.

21:46.389 --> 21:49.726
It's Kevin...

21:52.436 --> 21:54.105
You're back.

21:54.105 --> 21:57.275
No, we're back!

21:57.275 --> 21:59.360
Well.
This is uh...

21:59.360 --> 22:01.320
different.

22:08.203 --> 22:09.746
I'm not sure we'll
ever understand

22:09.746 --> 22:11.455
exactly what happened here.

22:11.455 --> 22:13.208
Oh I don't know.

22:13.208 --> 22:14.792
I think we learned that if two
people are really made for each

22:14.792 --> 22:18.337
other, nothing should
ever keep them apart.

22:24.177 --> 22:25.803
Ready?

22:25.803 --> 22:28.098
We're working on a new
line of sculptures

22:28.098 --> 22:31.226
with an important message.

22:35.521 --> 22:38.649
So, when do I meet your parents?

22:38.649 --> 22:40.151
Not yet.

22:53.248 --> 22:56.709
So the stone maiden and her
boyfriend got back together,

22:56.709 --> 22:59.003
the way they were
always meant to be...

22:59.003 --> 23:01.005
just like Julie and Kevin.

23:01.005 --> 23:03.424
That was a good story.
-That was amazing.

23:03.424 --> 23:05.260
Now you gotta lug
that rock back home.

23:05.260 --> 23:06.928
I know.

23:06.928 --> 23:09.222
I was kinda hoping one of
you guys were gonna help me.

23:09.222 --> 23:10.348
Ooh, sorry.

23:10.348 --> 23:12.934
I'm already late.

23:15.561 --> 23:18.773
I would, if I was
stronger, but I'm not...

23:18.773 --> 23:19.857
so I can't.

23:19.857 --> 23:20.857
Bye!

23:23.320 --> 23:25.780
Yeah, right.

23:27.240 --> 23:30.327
You know I'll help.

23:31.452 --> 23:32.495
Thanks Andy.

23:32.495 --> 23:34.080
You're the best!
Here.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.706
Bye!

23:35.706 --> 23:40.086
Hey, I said I'd help,
I didn't say I'd...

23:40.086 --> 23:43.547
From now on, anyone who
leaves early has to lug

23:43.547 --> 23:46.759
the fire wood for a month!

23:46.759 --> 23:48.386
Alright?
