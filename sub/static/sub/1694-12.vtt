Nucky: <i>You're going to West</i>
<i>Overton, Pennsylvania.</i>

00:02.669 --> 00:04.749
- The Overholt Distillery.
- Andrew Mellon's place.

00:04.750 --> 00:05.950
What do I do when I get there?

00:05.951 --> 00:07.951
Nucky: <i>Get it up and running</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

00:07.952 --> 00:10.676
I'm pregnant.
It's yours.

00:12.579 --> 00:15.348
There's 50 pounds of white we
borrowed big from Masseria for.

00:15.383 --> 00:16.783
We gotta start moving it.

00:16.818 --> 00:19.153
Meyer: <i>Nucky's lrishman,</i>
<i>he went after Masseria.</i>

00:19.187 --> 00:20.822
<i>They sent him back in a box.</i>

00:20.856 --> 00:22.323
Let this one go.

00:22.358 --> 00:23.825
Mrs. Thompson has left.

00:23.859 --> 00:25.127
The children?

00:25.161 --> 00:27.763
<i>A taxi to the station, all of them.</i>

00:31.267 --> 00:34.670
Rosetti's here with
Maserria's men, I'm guessing.

00:34.704 --> 00:36.772
I came to you for help.

00:37.907 --> 00:39.842
You're always a welcome guest here,

00:39.876 --> 00:41.176
but I have a business to run.

00:41.210 --> 00:42.811
Everything gonna stay the same.

00:42.845 --> 00:45.647
Only now, you'll have a pal in charge.

00:45.681 --> 00:47.749
A pound each.

00:50.019 --> 00:52.421
You know what?
You're under arrest.

00:52.455 --> 00:55.391
- What are you doing?
- We're going to Julia's.

00:55.425 --> 00:56.625
He doesn't belong here.

00:56.660 --> 00:58.695
This is the only home he has.

00:58.729 --> 01:01.130
Not in some fantasy world of yours.

01:01.165 --> 01:03.600
Mr. Rosetti wants
this man gone.

01:03.634 --> 01:05.268
Are we stuck with each other?

01:05.303 --> 01:08.138
I'll go down the road
with you a mite farther.

01:10.541 --> 01:12.876
- I cut a deal.
- With Torrio?

01:12.911 --> 01:14.945
With him.

01:14.979 --> 01:19.182
You and me sit down and we
talk about who dies, huh?

03:24.196 --> 03:26.916
Mayor Bader, what do you have to
say about all the recent violence?

03:26.951 --> 03:29.720
We have men in the field, boys.
Sheriff's Department is on it.

03:29.754 --> 03:31.288
When will some arrests be made?

03:31.322 --> 03:33.402
- Any day now.
- Have you lost control of the city?

03:33.424 --> 03:35.258
There's no need for wild accusations.

03:35.292 --> 03:36.726
<i>But the bodies are piling up.</i>

03:36.794 --> 03:38.295
( gunfire )

03:38.329 --> 03:40.497
Reporter:
<i>11 murders and counting.</i>

03:40.531 --> 03:42.399
That's a statement, not a question.

03:42.433 --> 03:44.001
Have you lost control of the city?

03:44.035 --> 03:46.395
Sheriff Keck and his men are
taking every possible measure

03:46.404 --> 03:49.172
- <i>to ensure public safety.</i>
- <i>( woman screaming )</i>

03:49.207 --> 03:51.675
- Have you lost control?
- Absolutely have not.

03:51.743 --> 03:52.897
( gunfire )

03:52.898 --> 03:54.778
Is that what you want
the tourists to believe?

03:54.812 --> 03:57.113
The everyday visitor
has nothing to fear.

03:57.148 --> 03:59.149
Nothing to fear except gunfire.

03:59.183 --> 04:01.651
Bader: <i>These attacks are gangsters</i>
<i>versus gangsters</i>

04:01.718 --> 04:05.121
and ordinary citizens have
no cause for undue concern.

04:05.156 --> 04:07.357
( gun shots )

04:07.391 --> 04:10.160
So you admit this town
you claim to control

04:10.194 --> 04:11.528
is in the hands of criminals?

04:11.562 --> 04:13.596
- Where they from?
- New York? Philly?

04:19.837 --> 04:22.238

Reporter #3: <i>They Italians?</i>

04:42.663 --> 04:44.463
Bader: <i>One at a time, please.</i>
<i>One at a time.</i>

04:44.464 --> 04:46.544
<i>Are they the ones behind</i>
<i>the shootings at the Ritz?</i>

04:46.545 --> 04:48.705
Now, once again, that is the
kind of irresponsible...

04:48.706 --> 04:51.306
- What about the Northside killings?
- Are the Negroes involved?

04:51.307 --> 04:53.667
- If you let me get a word in...
- Where's Nucky Thompson?

04:53.668 --> 04:56.174
- Mr. Thompson...
- Is he pulling the strings?

04:56.208 --> 04:57.848
- Mr. Thompson...
- Is he alive or dead?

04:57.849 --> 04:59.711
Let's get something straight.

04:59.745 --> 05:01.412
Nucky Thompson doesn't run this city.

05:01.447 --> 05:03.481
I do.

05:03.515 --> 05:05.383
( reporters laughing )

05:05.451 --> 05:07.118
Right!

05:08.520 --> 05:09.954
That's a riot.

05:13.126 --> 05:15.327
Mickey: <i>I left you nine messages</i>
<i>at the Ritz.</i>

05:15.361 --> 05:17.129
<i>I'm completely in the dark out here.</i>

05:17.163 --> 05:18.730
They don't have papers in Pennsylvania?

05:18.765 --> 05:20.032
<i>Did I miss something?</i>

05:20.066 --> 05:22.468
I'm fighting a war
from a fucking lumberyard.

05:22.502 --> 05:24.837
<i>Now see?</i>
<i>This is all new information.</i>

05:24.905 --> 05:26.305
Are you at Overholt?

05:26.339 --> 05:28.240
<i>I've been here for five days.</i>

05:28.274 --> 05:30.008
<i>And?</i>

05:30.043 --> 05:31.777
Don't you know what you got here?

05:31.811 --> 05:33.545
<i>I've never been near the place.</i>

05:33.580 --> 05:35.013
Then you need to come see it.

05:35.048 --> 05:37.816
I can't make it down the block
without getting shot at.

05:37.851 --> 05:39.651
- ( men shouting )
- Mickey: <i>That's too bad.</i>

05:39.652 --> 05:41.120
<i>'Cause it's worth the trip.</i>

05:41.155 --> 05:43.356
What the fuck
are you trying to tell me?

05:43.390 --> 05:45.258
<i>Well, I'm no expert,</i>

05:45.292 --> 05:47.060
but this place gets cooking,

05:47.094 --> 05:50.030
you're the biggest bootlegger
in the country.

05:50.064 --> 05:51.832
<i>( shouting continues )</i>

05:53.601 --> 05:56.369
- <i>Did you hear me?</i>
- I'll call you back.

06:00.475 --> 06:02.142
What the fuck is going on?

06:02.177 --> 06:04.978
Break it up.
I said break it up!

06:09.050 --> 06:10.818
You promised to keep a lid on this.

06:10.852 --> 06:13.320
Got to blow off steam
some kind of ways.

06:13.421 --> 06:15.341
He gave his word they'd
stay on their own side.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.889
How they supposed to get to the head?

06:16.890 --> 06:18.892
Dig a hole.
Why's it my problem?

06:18.927 --> 06:21.167
How about I give you the
shovel and you do the digging?

06:21.168 --> 06:24.131
Chalky, enough.

06:25.267 --> 06:27.301
Okay?

06:33.675 --> 06:35.309
Let's get something straight.

06:35.344 --> 06:37.478
I need him and I need those men.

06:37.512 --> 06:39.232
Maybe I ought to take
my boys and go home.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.883
Fine, call Torrio.
Tell him the deal's off.

06:41.917 --> 06:43.751
No, the deal's with me.

06:43.785 --> 06:47.354
Then what's a handshake with
you supposed to be worth?

06:49.057 --> 06:52.426
We'll head to the Boardwalk,
down by Margate.

06:52.461 --> 06:54.501
See if we can't get Rosetti
to stick his head out.

06:54.502 --> 06:56.130
You need to watch out for civilians.

06:56.198 --> 06:58.399
No, we need to watch out for ourselves.

06:58.434 --> 07:00.635
The rest is for you to clean up.

07:00.702 --> 07:03.037
Get your bingo-bongos
to help.

07:04.205 --> 07:06.273
Come on, we're going hunting.

07:07.809 --> 07:10.177
- <i>( music playing )</i>
- ( men chatting )

07:11.579 --> 07:13.547
You were all told
to lay off the supply.

07:13.581 --> 07:14.616
The whores are gone.

07:14.617 --> 07:16.737
The fuck we supposed to do
if we can't have a drink?

07:16.738 --> 07:18.885
Keep sober so you don't
get taken out next time.

07:18.919 --> 07:21.754
If I'm gonna catch it,
I'd rather be tight.

07:21.788 --> 07:24.323
You want the boss to hear you say that?

07:24.358 --> 07:26.559
What the fuck do I care anymore?

07:32.432 --> 07:33.833
No wine.

07:33.867 --> 07:37.904
Forget about it. I no come
all this way to have a drink.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.341
Keep everyone away from here.

07:42.476 --> 07:44.444
( snaps fingers ) Let's go.

07:50.886 --> 07:53.054
( speaks Italian )

07:53.089 --> 07:55.791
How many men I give you?

07:55.825 --> 07:57.459
Exactly?

07:57.494 --> 07:59.228
Exactly.

07:59.296 --> 08:01.730
43.

08:01.764 --> 08:04.266
And how many of my men you have left?

08:04.300 --> 08:06.001
Exactly?

08:06.036 --> 08:08.238
31.

08:08.272 --> 08:10.773
Plus nine of my own.

08:10.808 --> 08:13.810
So 12 of my men you lose.

08:13.844 --> 08:16.312
And for what?

08:21.785 --> 08:24.020
I got the hotel.

08:25.789 --> 08:28.691
I got the casino.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.460
I got his warehouse.

08:31.495 --> 08:35.131
You no have Nucky Thompson.

08:35.164 --> 08:38.067
Huh?
And Arnold Rothstein,

08:38.101 --> 08:40.970
he's still eating dinner
in Times Square.

08:41.005 --> 08:43.172
All these words you say,

08:43.240 --> 08:45.008
what do they mean?

08:45.042 --> 08:46.976
I'm leaving bodies on the ground, Joe.

08:47.011 --> 08:49.513
We're winning.

08:49.547 --> 08:51.481
And half of Thompson's crew,

08:51.515 --> 08:53.616
they're shines.

08:53.651 --> 08:56.452
You can't count them as a whole person.

08:56.487 --> 08:59.922
( speaking Italian )

09:01.959 --> 09:03.093
So?

09:11.902 --> 09:14.803
What does it matter once they're dead?

09:22.445 --> 09:25.046
I'm gonna keep mine.

09:39.228 --> 09:41.296
Hmm.

09:49.172 --> 09:51.006
Perfect.

09:52.341 --> 09:55.210
Now you know what time it is.

10:00.015 --> 10:02.751
( speaks Italian )

10:15.798 --> 10:18.032
I'd like to go in, please.

10:29.144 --> 10:31.079
Such a gentleman.

10:32.214 --> 10:33.882
Not always.

10:46.195 --> 10:48.330
<i>( lock clicks )</i>

10:52.001 --> 10:55.304

I have your lunch.

10:58.108 --> 11:00.510
( sighs ) It's your favorite.

11:00.544 --> 11:03.079
Ham on white bread.

11:03.113 --> 11:04.848
A dill pickle.

11:04.882 --> 11:08.017
And Oreos if you finish everything.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.624
Aren't you hungry?

11:28.940 --> 11:31.542
Why don't you come out
and we'll eat together?

11:31.576 --> 11:33.143
Would you like that?

11:37.015 --> 11:39.817
Then I'll come in and sit with you.

11:39.851 --> 11:42.319
That way, it won't be so lonely.

12:03.776 --> 12:05.810
Yes.

12:08.380 --> 12:10.582
All right, darling.

12:12.785 --> 12:15.319

<i>the game last night?</i>

12:40.313 --> 12:42.314
Here.

12:42.348 --> 12:44.282
It's good for another scrape.

12:44.317 --> 12:46.085
I'm in the middle of this.

12:46.119 --> 12:47.319
What happened?

12:47.354 --> 12:50.255
Slug straight through the radiator.

12:50.290 --> 12:52.725
And the hose is shot.

12:52.759 --> 12:55.060
I'll do that after.

12:57.664 --> 12:59.799
You're gonna get all dirty.

12:59.866 --> 13:02.635
Who kept that old Willys
of yours running?

13:02.669 --> 13:04.804
Who sold it to me in the first place?

13:04.838 --> 13:06.172
Wasn't anything wrong with it.

13:06.206 --> 13:08.842
Except for the brakes,
rear axle, cylinder heads.

13:08.876 --> 13:12.211
Worked well enough to get you
and June lost in the woods.

13:12.246 --> 13:15.715
Yeah, those were nice rides.

13:15.749 --> 13:18.451
You got them someplace safe?

13:19.520 --> 13:22.722
With her sister up in Brigantine.

13:24.559 --> 13:25.725
You?

13:25.760 --> 13:27.260
How's that?

13:27.294 --> 13:29.429
Margaret and the kids.

13:32.499 --> 13:34.734
Ow! Shit!

13:34.768 --> 13:37.070
- Fuck.
- ( laughs )

13:38.538 --> 13:40.539
What are you laughing about?

13:42.609 --> 13:44.543
Who said I'm laughing?

13:51.316 --> 13:53.384
Look at us.

13:53.418 --> 13:56.721
Two Pineys
and a broke-down car.

14:01.727 --> 14:04.362
Maybe that's why.

14:04.396 --> 14:06.431
Why what?

14:06.465 --> 14:09.467
We didn't stop
while the going was good.

14:09.501 --> 14:12.270
Always trying to pinch
for a little bit more.

14:12.338 --> 14:14.806
Just in case.

14:14.840 --> 14:17.142
I never told them to pass
the 18th Amendment.

14:17.176 --> 14:19.010
Did you?

14:19.045 --> 14:21.513
Where's it gotten us?

14:23.783 --> 14:25.684
Worry about that later.

14:25.718 --> 14:28.320
After Rosetti's in the ground.

14:28.354 --> 14:29.754
Then what?

14:29.789 --> 14:31.223
Get the town running again.

14:31.291 --> 14:33.826
Keep everybody in line this time.

14:33.860 --> 14:35.494
Leave that part to me.

14:35.528 --> 14:37.696
Stop kidding yourself, Eli.

14:37.731 --> 14:39.765
You'll never be Sheriff again.

14:39.833 --> 14:43.402
You got to rub my face in it?

14:43.436 --> 14:44.803
After all this?

14:44.838 --> 14:47.306
That's not what I meant.

14:47.340 --> 14:50.976
It's over here however this plays out.

14:52.379 --> 14:54.579
No one's gonna come
within 100 yards of me.

14:54.647 --> 14:56.815
Not in Atlantic City.
Not in New York.

14:56.850 --> 14:59.584
- Not anywhere.
- Sure they will.

15:00.953 --> 15:03.822
You just got to offer
them something they want.

15:03.856 --> 15:06.492
How do I do that?

15:06.526 --> 15:08.894
I don't know.

15:08.929 --> 15:11.263
You're the man with all the angles.

15:17.670 --> 15:20.739
<i>( music playing )</i>

15:20.774 --> 15:23.175
- Mr. Doyle.
- <i>Am I disturbing you?</i>

15:23.243 --> 15:24.676
Yes.

15:24.711 --> 15:28.113
Oh, all right.

15:28.148 --> 15:30.582
I know you said you didn't
want to talk to me again.

15:30.617 --> 15:32.618
It's just...

15:32.652 --> 15:34.987
I'm all at sea over here.

15:41.461 --> 15:44.296
<i>( turns music down )</i>

15:44.330 --> 15:47.466
And where is it

15:47.500 --> 15:49.334
you've gone adrift?

15:49.368 --> 15:51.102
<i>I'm saying three words.</i>

15:51.170 --> 15:54.973
Overholt. Distillery.
Pennsylvania.

15:55.007 --> 15:57.242
I know about Overholt,
Mr. Doyle.

15:57.309 --> 16:00.779
What I don't is why you
wish to discuss it with me.

16:00.846 --> 16:03.881
Because I'm sitting in it

16:03.949 --> 16:06.284
right now.

16:06.318 --> 16:08.520
It's...

16:08.554 --> 16:11.189
very large.

16:11.223 --> 16:14.793
And a certain person that we both know

16:14.861 --> 16:18.630
made an arrangement
with another person to run it.

16:18.664 --> 16:22.067
<i>But that first person,</i>
<i>his back is to the wall.</i>

16:22.101 --> 16:26.337
I bet he'd give up anything

16:26.372 --> 16:29.506
just to keep from going under
for a third time.

16:33.111 --> 16:35.112
I'm listening.

16:48.458 --> 16:50.059
How'd you get that scar?

16:50.093 --> 16:53.863
Mulberry Bend.
You know where that is?

16:53.897 --> 16:55.865
- Sure.
- Bandit's Alley.

16:55.899 --> 16:58.968
Little shit came up behind me
one night with a shank...

17:00.337 --> 17:03.239
carved me another smile.

17:03.273 --> 17:05.107
It's a park now.

17:05.175 --> 17:06.709
Push your baby in a stroller.

17:06.742 --> 17:08.744
Pricks like you, they come and go.

17:08.779 --> 17:10.480
Nobody remembers them.

17:10.515 --> 17:12.348
All that stays is the law.

17:12.383 --> 17:15.986
Then I guess I'd better reform my ways.

17:22.894 --> 17:25.730
( grunts )

17:25.763 --> 17:27.732
Who's your partner?

17:27.766 --> 17:29.000
Nobody.

17:29.034 --> 17:30.669
Who do you buy from?

17:30.703 --> 17:32.537
- Some Chink.
- Which one?

17:32.572 --> 17:35.374
Fuck do I know?
Name sounds like a toothache.

17:35.408 --> 17:36.575
Who put up the money?

17:36.610 --> 17:38.277
My sister.

17:38.312 --> 17:41.381
She lifted it from your wallet while
she was yanking your <i>ghianda.</i>

17:41.415 --> 17:43.950
- ( spits ) There's something
you don't understand.

17:43.985 --> 17:46.386
You think you get some shyster,

17:46.421 --> 17:48.555
walk out of here, beat the rap?

17:50.058 --> 17:51.992
You could disappear.

17:52.026 --> 17:55.262
You said there was the law.

17:56.331 --> 17:58.265
We are the law.

17:59.901 --> 18:02.235
What if...

18:02.270 --> 18:04.938
what if I tell you where you
could find 50 pounds of white?

18:04.973 --> 18:07.241
Yours?

18:07.275 --> 18:09.076
Why would I give up my own stash?

18:09.110 --> 18:12.179
To save your ass.

18:12.214 --> 18:13.981
Is that what you're offering?

18:14.016 --> 18:16.050
<i>Nobody is offering anything.</i>

18:16.084 --> 18:17.718
Then what's in it for me?

18:17.786 --> 18:19.720
You like to gamble, don't you?

18:19.754 --> 18:22.589
Only when I got a chance of winning.

18:22.657 --> 18:26.026
Best you could do here is not lose.

18:32.834 --> 18:34.835
I got the broad here.

18:34.870 --> 18:37.405
Please show her in.

18:40.542 --> 18:42.976
That's all right.
Thank you.

18:48.482 --> 18:50.216
May I sit?

18:50.251 --> 18:53.953
It's your house.
You don't have to ask permission.

19:00.860 --> 19:02.428
Must be hard

19:02.462 --> 19:04.730
to be away from your girls.

19:04.764 --> 19:06.865
Huh?

19:06.899 --> 19:08.433
Your two daughters.

19:08.467 --> 19:10.969
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

19:11.003 --> 19:13.438
At that age,

19:13.473 --> 19:16.975
you take off for a few days,
you miss so much.

19:17.043 --> 19:18.743
How old are they?

19:18.811 --> 19:22.113
16 and 14, I think.

19:22.148 --> 19:23.915
Tommy's only six.

19:23.949 --> 19:25.850
<i>Six.</i>

19:25.885 --> 19:28.186
<i>Got his whole life ahead of him.</i>

19:28.220 --> 19:31.156
I've tried to shelter him

19:31.190 --> 19:33.591
from harsh realities.

19:33.659 --> 19:35.493
It hasn't been easy.

19:35.527 --> 19:38.095
Hey.

19:38.130 --> 19:40.264
Don't get so down on yourself.

19:40.299 --> 19:43.367
You're doing a swell job.

19:43.402 --> 19:45.769
There's always company around here.

19:45.804 --> 19:47.471
Kids love that.

19:49.107 --> 19:51.341
Maybe...

19:51.409 --> 19:54.478
maybe it's best we let
you conduct your business

19:54.513 --> 19:56.981
without distractions.

19:57.015 --> 19:59.750
Don't see what you're getting at.

19:59.785 --> 20:03.320
That Tommy and I go someplace else.
Just for a bit.

20:03.355 --> 20:05.188
Yeah.

20:05.223 --> 20:07.691
I don't think I want that.

20:07.725 --> 20:09.827
Why not?

20:09.861 --> 20:11.962
I like having you around.

20:11.996 --> 20:15.199
If I didn't know where you were,

20:15.233 --> 20:19.003
I might get...
anxious.

20:19.037 --> 20:22.673
You don't have to worry about me.

20:22.707 --> 20:25.676
Jeez, Red, I hope not.

20:27.045 --> 20:30.348
This is gonna work out.
You'll see.

20:31.751 --> 20:35.354
Get everything settled,

20:35.388 --> 20:37.890
then you and me,

20:37.924 --> 20:40.393
we'll show this town how it's done.

20:40.427 --> 20:42.562
You and me?

20:42.596 --> 20:45.165
Set you up fine.

20:45.199 --> 20:47.267
Best of everything.

20:47.302 --> 20:50.504
All this grief running whores,

20:50.538 --> 20:52.606
you won't need to bother.

20:52.640 --> 20:55.542
I'm gonna treat you like a queen.

20:55.577 --> 20:58.312
Would you?

20:58.347 --> 21:01.182
Up there on a pedestal.

21:03.719 --> 21:06.087
And where are you?

21:13.329 --> 21:15.530
I'm way down below.

21:15.598 --> 21:18.333
Like a little bug

21:18.367 --> 21:20.802
crawling around on your toe.

21:23.940 --> 21:25.841
I could crush you.

21:25.875 --> 21:28.176
Just squash me flat

21:28.211 --> 21:31.079
till I'm begging for more.

21:36.819 --> 21:40.322
Is that what you'd like?

21:49.499 --> 21:52.234
I'm just having some fun.

21:52.301 --> 21:55.336
People have fun in different ways.

21:58.841 --> 22:00.474
There's no need

22:00.509 --> 22:04.078
to be ashamed of any of them.

22:04.145 --> 22:08.316
That's what this club is all about.

22:14.622 --> 22:17.090
You're a pistol, Red.

22:17.124 --> 22:20.326
Then why don't you pull my trigger

22:20.361 --> 22:24.063
and see what shoots out?

22:33.907 --> 22:36.442
I don't know about you, Gyp...

22:37.811 --> 22:39.679
but sometimes,

22:39.713 --> 22:42.448
I wish someone

22:42.483 --> 22:44.484
would give me exactly

22:44.518 --> 22:47.220
what I deserve.

22:50.558 --> 22:53.026
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

23:05.308 --> 23:08.277
- Hello?
- <i>This is Arnold Rothstein.</i>

23:08.311 --> 23:10.278
<i>To whom am I speaking?</i>

23:10.346 --> 23:12.247
Eli Thompson.

23:12.281 --> 23:14.583
<i>I was hoping to speak to your brother.</i>

23:16.052 --> 23:18.454
It's him.

23:26.829 --> 23:28.096
Arnold.

23:28.130 --> 23:30.832
I'm calling with an offer.

23:30.866 --> 23:32.968
Nucky:
<i>How did you get this number?</i>

23:33.002 --> 23:35.304
Is that important?

23:35.338 --> 23:37.940
No.

23:38.008 --> 23:40.409
<i>Your distillery in Pennsylvania.</i>

23:40.510 --> 23:42.511
Overholt.

23:42.546 --> 23:44.013
<i>For a percentage of ownership,</i>

23:44.081 --> 23:47.984
<i>I can arrange for Joe Masseria</i>
<i>to back away from Gyp Rosetti.</i>

23:48.019 --> 23:50.186
Back away meaning what?

23:50.220 --> 23:52.788
<i>That he completely pulls his support,</i>

23:52.823 --> 23:54.890
<i>removes all of his men.</i>

23:54.925 --> 23:56.625
How much of a percentage?

23:56.693 --> 23:59.728
99,

23:59.763 --> 24:02.131
Mr. Thompson.

24:02.165 --> 24:05.801
<i>I will require 99%.</i>

24:07.770 --> 24:10.439
I'm offering you a way out.

24:13.476 --> 24:15.510
If I can deliver Masseria,

24:15.545 --> 24:17.912
<i>do we have a deal?</i>

24:20.449 --> 24:21.983
Yes.

24:22.018 --> 24:24.252
<i>You'll be hearing from me later.</i>

24:24.286 --> 24:26.721
<i>( hangs up )</i>

24:31.126 --> 24:34.862
Big bait catches big rat.

24:37.565 --> 24:40.300
Have you lived here
long, Mrs. Hollis?

24:40.334 --> 24:42.902
I'd say it's 16 years.

24:42.970 --> 24:46.539
Spring of '07.
So, yes, just 16.

24:46.573 --> 24:50.242
Harold wanted to be somewhere he
felt he could be of the most use.

24:50.276 --> 24:53.311
I can't say I didn't have
other ambitions in mind.

24:53.346 --> 24:57.015
But we stayed, and I think that
turned out to be the right decision.

24:59.852 --> 25:01.586
You live...?

25:01.620 --> 25:04.856
Over on Scholes Street.
By Graham.

25:04.890 --> 25:06.991
You've got everything you need there.

25:07.026 --> 25:09.494
It's not far
from the rest of my family.

25:09.528 --> 25:11.930
Harold has a sister in Bushwick.

25:17.370 --> 25:18.737
Well, dear?

25:21.641 --> 25:25.543
- Why don't you show Mrs....
- Rohan.

25:25.578 --> 25:29.347
Mrs. Rohan the room and she
can make her decision.

25:29.381 --> 25:31.215
I'll just tend to a few things.

25:31.250 --> 25:32.417
Would you like to?

25:32.451 --> 25:34.585
I would, yes.

25:34.686 --> 25:36.821
All right.

25:47.599 --> 25:49.334
This is where my husband sees people.

25:49.401 --> 25:52.037
Coughs, cuts, fevers,

25:52.071 --> 25:55.274
indigestion...
everything.

25:57.077 --> 26:00.145
I need to bring my monthly on.

26:00.180 --> 26:01.981
When was your last?

26:02.015 --> 26:03.716
Six weeks.

26:03.750 --> 26:05.251
He can help you then.

26:05.285 --> 26:07.286
He does that for many women.

26:09.222 --> 26:12.692
He's very careful.
Very thorough.

26:19.200 --> 26:21.001
You can take a little time.

26:21.035 --> 26:24.538
<i>Come back if that's what you'd like.</i>

26:25.940 --> 26:29.276
I'm lost.

26:29.310 --> 26:31.778
I'm completely lost.

26:34.281 --> 26:36.916
I never tell anyone what to do.

26:47.393 --> 26:50.162
Do I leave my dress on?

26:52.532 --> 26:54.900
I'll get you a clean gown.

27:08.148 --> 27:10.616
You're looking at this the wrong way.

27:11.951 --> 27:14.819
The bulls collared me, all right?

27:17.222 --> 27:19.424
But I worked out an angle.

27:21.493 --> 27:23.728
I'm not doing time.

27:23.762 --> 27:25.830
And no one's the wiser.

27:27.333 --> 27:30.468
We just pick up where we left off.

27:36.541 --> 27:38.875
And I'll cover the hit.

27:39.911 --> 27:41.578
I will, Meyer.

27:41.613 --> 27:43.380
I guarantee it.

27:43.415 --> 27:45.816
Out of my pocket.

27:51.824 --> 27:53.424
You're not gonna say nothing?

27:53.459 --> 27:54.959
50 pounds.

27:54.993 --> 27:58.563
100 thousand

27:58.630 --> 28:01.399
fucking dollars.

28:08.375 --> 28:09.741
Gentlemen.

28:09.776 --> 28:12.078
Let's get this over with.

28:24.591 --> 28:25.925
Luciano:
<i>What the fuck?</i>

28:25.959 --> 28:28.094
( speaking Italian )

28:34.469 --> 28:36.803
And you.

28:36.838 --> 28:38.572
I sorry.

28:38.606 --> 28:41.208
I never know your name.

28:41.243 --> 28:43.444
Meyer.

28:43.478 --> 28:45.179
"Maya."

28:45.213 --> 28:47.782
Is that ours?

28:47.816 --> 28:50.184
Not anymore.

28:52.855 --> 28:56.157
Charlie, Meyer, thank you for coming.

28:56.192 --> 28:57.959
I won't keep you very long

28:57.994 --> 29:00.562
since you have such full
portions on your plates.

29:02.365 --> 29:03.932
What's that doing here?

29:03.966 --> 29:05.867
I had it delivered

29:05.901 --> 29:08.036
so that Mr. Masseria
could see

29:08.070 --> 29:10.138
that I'm as good as my word.

29:11.740 --> 29:13.341
The two of you?

29:13.375 --> 29:15.510
Have agreed to new terms of peace

29:15.544 --> 29:17.945
given the change in circumstances.

29:17.980 --> 29:19.714
What change?

29:19.748 --> 29:21.716
That this heroin

29:21.750 --> 29:24.786
that I paid for
with my fucking money...

29:26.355 --> 29:28.824
now belongs to him.

29:28.858 --> 29:32.060
A.R., if I may inquire,
how did you obtain that?

29:32.095 --> 29:34.696
Charlie gave it to my associates.

29:34.764 --> 29:37.967
Sam, Gaetano, if you would.

29:40.270 --> 29:42.338
How you doing, kid?

29:42.372 --> 29:45.174
We treat you too rough?

29:45.208 --> 29:49.145
You can always file a complaint
with the department.

29:58.656 --> 30:00.890
He set me up, Joe.

30:03.460 --> 30:05.661
You fucking set me up.

30:07.231 --> 30:08.898
Who the fuck do you think you are?

30:08.932 --> 30:11.167
- Charlie. Charlie.
- I worked for that.

30:11.201 --> 30:13.002
I busted my ass for that.

30:13.037 --> 30:14.871
It was my idea!
My deal!

30:14.906 --> 30:16.606
- Charlie.
- <i>You wouldn't lift a finger.</i>

30:16.641 --> 30:18.976
Sit behind your desk,
making phone calls.

30:19.010 --> 30:21.311
I'm out there in the fucking world.

30:21.379 --> 30:24.648
Charlie, if you don't shut
up, we're both dead. Yes?

30:42.136 --> 30:44.705
A.R.,

30:44.739 --> 30:46.940
Mr. Masseria,

30:46.974 --> 30:49.742
you know how he gets.

30:56.149 --> 31:00.085
All this time I thought I'd
had some civilizing effect.

31:01.954 --> 31:04.689
But there's only so much
you can teach a person

31:04.723 --> 31:09.594
<i>until you reach the limits</i>
<i>of his capabilities.</i>

31:09.628 --> 31:13.031
<i>You understand, though,</i>
<i>don't you, Meyer?</i>

31:13.066 --> 31:15.968
Yes, I do.

31:16.002 --> 31:19.071
Then it's your job then if you want it.

31:20.641 --> 31:22.642
Seeing as how I'm flush with product,

31:22.677 --> 31:25.612
I'd like to offer a proposition.

31:25.647 --> 31:29.250
How would you like to join me
in the heroin business?

31:30.952 --> 31:33.387
In exchange for what?

31:44.500 --> 31:47.068
- Son of a bitch.
- Dirty fucking shines.

31:47.103 --> 31:49.337
Hey, what the fuck
do you think you're doing?

31:49.405 --> 31:51.773
Can't be too hard to figure out.

31:51.807 --> 31:53.241
Give you a better view.

31:53.276 --> 31:55.410
Just back it up, pal.
Okay?

31:55.444 --> 31:57.746
I don't know about you,
once I let loose,

31:57.780 --> 31:58.947
there ain't no stopping.

31:58.982 --> 32:01.583
Man: <i>Yeah, get you</i>
<i>some of that.</i>

32:01.618 --> 32:03.152
I can help you with that.

32:04.721 --> 32:07.522
And me with both hands full.

32:07.556 --> 32:09.591
Ain't that just like a dinge?

32:09.625 --> 32:11.426
Going out with his dick swinging.

32:16.665 --> 32:19.634
- <i>( phone rings )</i>
- Man: Come on, Joe.

32:19.668 --> 32:23.138
Chalky: Sure do like to
reach for that pistol.

32:32.148 --> 32:34.216
What you so scared about?

32:35.519 --> 32:37.620
Nothing I'm looking at now.

32:44.996 --> 32:47.297
Let's see what you're made of.

32:47.331 --> 32:50.366
- Man: Chalky!
- ( men shouting )

32:50.400 --> 32:52.669
Let him go.
Come on.

32:54.371 --> 32:58.275
( gunshots )

32:58.309 --> 33:00.744
Nucky: <i>I just hung up</i>
<i>with Arnold Rothstein.</i>

33:00.778 --> 33:03.179
Gyp Rosetti's at the Artemis Club.

33:03.214 --> 33:06.016
Joe Masseria is
withdrawing his support.

33:06.050 --> 33:08.318
I know that, Rosetti doesn't.

33:08.353 --> 33:10.621
- How'd that happen?
- I paid for it.

33:10.655 --> 33:15.192
I need to talk to you
<i>and you</i> in private.

33:20.231 --> 33:22.265
You can kill each other later.

33:22.300 --> 33:24.701
In the meantime, let's plan this out.

33:28.072 --> 33:30.741
( men muttering )

33:35.213 --> 33:37.014
Man #2:
<i>Talk about this later.</i>

33:43.688 --> 33:46.624
Do you approve?

33:46.658 --> 33:49.026
You're class all the way, Red.

33:49.061 --> 33:51.596
I'm here to please you.

33:54.166 --> 33:58.169
All you have to do is say the word.

34:22.058 --> 34:24.426
Only I do that.

34:33.369 --> 34:35.437
Little kink of mine.

34:46.181 --> 34:49.449
I like a man who's careful
about his appearance.

34:52.420 --> 34:54.856
Well?

34:54.891 --> 34:57.593
What is it you're
intending to do to me?

34:59.930 --> 35:02.098
<i>You really want to know?</i>

35:02.132 --> 35:05.135
I can't wait.

35:07.205 --> 35:09.740
I'm gonna break you in half.

35:09.774 --> 35:13.109
Split you right down the middle

35:13.144 --> 35:16.346
till you beg me to stop.
But I won't stop.

35:16.380 --> 35:20.617
<i>Beg and beg, but there's</i>
<i>nothing you can do.</i>

35:20.684 --> 35:24.053
And when I'm done,

35:24.088 --> 35:26.423
there won't be nothing left
but a wet spot

35:26.457 --> 35:29.358
and a hunk of hair.

35:29.393 --> 35:31.460
You know why?

35:35.999 --> 35:37.633
Tell me.

35:43.605 --> 35:46.674
You're a worthless piece of shit.

35:48.043 --> 35:51.278
- Am I?
- You know you are.

35:51.346 --> 35:53.847
You look in the mirror
and you know you deserve

35:53.882 --> 35:55.716
everything you're gonna get.

35:58.853 --> 36:02.090
I'm ugly, aren't I?

36:02.124 --> 36:04.725
Just an ugly little animal.

36:04.760 --> 36:07.796
- Say it again.
- Ugly...

36:07.830 --> 36:10.765
little...

36:10.799 --> 36:13.301
ape.

36:15.537 --> 36:17.372
You laughing at me?

36:19.141 --> 36:22.543
Why wouldn't I?

36:22.611 --> 36:24.479
Everybody else does.

36:24.513 --> 36:26.548
( gasps )

36:27.883 --> 36:31.486
Go ahead if that's what you want.

36:48.004 --> 36:50.505
Would you like me to whip you?

37:18.634 --> 37:20.668
( moans )

37:22.237 --> 37:24.172
That's not tight enough, is it?

37:24.206 --> 37:26.541
- No.
- Not for an ape like you.

37:26.575 --> 37:28.476
No.

37:28.544 --> 37:31.245
You need to be held down.

37:31.279 --> 37:34.181
So you don't run off into the jungle.

37:37.819 --> 37:40.620
<i>( Gyp gasping )</i>

37:44.258 --> 37:46.592
What do you say?

37:46.627 --> 37:49.028
- Hurt me.
- Hurt me what?

37:49.062 --> 37:51.330
Hurt me, please.

37:55.135 --> 37:59.272
Oh, Red, here I thought
we were just having some fun.

37:59.307 --> 38:02.909
All I have is this house and that boy.

38:02.944 --> 38:05.946
I don't blame you, Red.
I really don't.

38:05.980 --> 38:08.115
But the thing of it is,

38:08.149 --> 38:09.850
somebody's always got to lose.

38:09.917 --> 38:12.252
( whimpers )

38:15.023 --> 38:16.691
Ah!

38:26.535 --> 38:29.404
- <i>( car door closes )</i>
- Man: That car ready?

38:35.611 --> 38:37.479
- ( men chattering )
- Gyp: <i>What the fuck?</i>

38:37.513 --> 38:39.080
<i>Where they going?</i>

38:42.519 --> 38:45.654
What the fuck is going on?!

38:45.689 --> 38:47.990
<i>( music playing )</i>

38:51.161 --> 38:53.696
Hey!

38:55.432 --> 38:58.367
Hey, where the fuck is everybody?

38:58.401 --> 38:59.635
- They're gone.
- Gone where?

38:59.669 --> 39:00.936
New York.
Masseria's orders.

39:00.971 --> 39:03.505
- <i>( gunshot )</i>
- ( men clamoring )

39:16.787 --> 39:18.655
Go!

39:30.435 --> 39:32.737
- Where's Tonino?
- Fuck him, let's go.

39:33.806 --> 39:36.308
<i>( music continues )</i>

40:50.548 --> 40:52.783
( grunts )

40:57.088 --> 40:59.757
( groans )

41:02.994 --> 41:05.262
( both straining )

41:51.812 --> 41:54.213
Put the gun down.

41:57.884 --> 42:01.154
Do you think I give a fuck?

42:03.090 --> 42:07.560
Put it down.

42:12.532 --> 42:15.768
Put it down!

42:34.853 --> 42:37.255
Tommy, close your eyes.

42:53.606 --> 42:55.707
Al:
<i>Here comes Masseria's boys.</i>

42:55.742 --> 42:58.777
And here they go.

43:05.351 --> 43:08.120
( men screaming )

43:11.323 --> 43:14.258
( screaming )

43:15.761 --> 43:17.829
Man:
<i>Die, you fucking cowards!</i>

43:19.732 --> 43:22.901
Man #2: <i>That's for you,</i>
<i>sons of bitches!</i>

43:25.638 --> 43:28.139
( gunfire stops )

43:29.008 --> 43:31.443
<i>( laughter )</i>

43:44.857 --> 43:46.658
Well, I got that out of my system.

43:46.693 --> 43:49.228
You and me both.

43:50.497 --> 43:53.433
( laughs )

43:54.568 --> 43:56.837
( whistles )

43:59.040 --> 44:02.109
Come on.
Back to Chicago.

44:02.144 --> 44:05.246
- <i>( record player grinding )</i>
- <i>( footsteps )</i>

44:09.251 --> 44:11.785
Eli:
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

44:17.025 --> 44:19.192
<i>God.</i>

44:24.899 --> 44:26.566
<i>Jesus.</i>

45:03.806 --> 45:05.940
Who did this?

45:08.744 --> 45:10.511
You came.

45:10.546 --> 45:12.513
Where's Rosetti?

45:12.548 --> 45:15.416
I was good.

45:15.450 --> 45:17.885
I did what...

45:17.919 --> 45:21.488
I went upstairs like you said to.

45:22.857 --> 45:24.024
What?

45:24.092 --> 45:27.060
And the man...

45:27.095 --> 45:29.863
the man, he...

45:33.134 --> 45:35.001
Nucky.

45:35.035 --> 45:38.871
He did something very bad to me.

45:43.310 --> 45:45.144
<i>( pot rattles )</i>

46:08.468 --> 46:11.136
( doorbell rings )

46:15.242 --> 46:16.909
Julia:
<i>Who is it?</i>

46:18.579 --> 46:20.313
Who's there?

46:20.381 --> 46:22.549
Me.

46:25.787 --> 46:27.955
Don't turn on the light.

46:27.989 --> 46:30.124
Why?

46:30.158 --> 46:32.359
What happened?

46:32.394 --> 46:34.795
Richard, are you all right?

46:34.829 --> 46:37.631
Neither of us are hurt.

46:37.665 --> 46:40.334
What does that mean?

46:44.439 --> 46:46.273
It's not our blood.

46:48.075 --> 46:50.443
Then whose is it?

46:51.512 --> 46:53.614
Take the boy.

46:53.648 --> 46:55.749
Go on.

47:08.730 --> 47:11.098
Upstairs.
Fred's room.

47:11.133 --> 47:13.601
I need to know what's going on.

47:13.635 --> 47:15.302
<i>Just take him up.</i>

47:15.337 --> 47:18.406
Julia, please.

47:26.514 --> 47:28.148
And turn off that lamp.

47:32.854 --> 47:34.855
Did anyone see you pull up?

47:39.160 --> 47:41.628
You don't come home like this.

47:41.662 --> 47:43.663
Whatever battle you're fighting.

47:44.699 --> 47:48.101
That's not what a soldier does.

47:48.135 --> 47:51.071
You need to clean yourself up.

47:51.105 --> 47:53.907
I'll talk to her,
and in the light of day...

47:53.975 --> 47:56.310
No.

47:57.579 --> 47:59.547
He's safe.

47:59.581 --> 48:02.482
That's all that matters.

48:24.339 --> 48:26.373
( phone rings )

48:26.441 --> 48:29.009
Randolph.

48:29.043 --> 48:30.877
Hello?

48:30.944 --> 48:32.545
<i>This is Andrew Mellon.</i>

48:32.580 --> 48:33.746
Is it really?

48:33.781 --> 48:36.049
Why would I claim otherwise?

48:37.484 --> 48:39.018
Are you in a location

48:39.086 --> 48:41.321
where your conversation
might be overheard?

48:47.428 --> 48:49.963
No one can hear me, sir.

48:50.030 --> 48:51.665
<i>Then I have a request.</i>

48:51.699 --> 48:53.500
It has come to my attention

48:53.534 --> 48:56.303
that a certain business
enterprise of mine,

48:56.337 --> 48:59.706
in the absence of my full attention,

48:59.741 --> 49:04.178
has been illicitly commandeered
by a criminal organization.

49:04.212 --> 49:06.347
<i>What enterprise, sir?</i>

49:06.381 --> 49:09.283
The Overholt Distillery
in western Pennsylvania.

49:09.318 --> 49:12.086
I don't understand
what you want me to do.

49:12.154 --> 49:14.122
Shutter the premises.

49:14.156 --> 49:16.857
Apprehend and indict anyone

49:16.892 --> 49:19.660
<i>associated with its illegal operation.</i>

49:19.695 --> 49:23.030
You want me to arrest Enoch Thompson?

49:23.065 --> 49:26.634
<i>It was Mr. Thompson who brought</i>
<i>this illegality to my attention.</i>

49:26.668 --> 49:29.904
<i>Then who are we talking about?</i>

49:33.976 --> 49:35.042
Arnold...

49:35.077 --> 49:36.277
Arnold...

49:36.311 --> 49:38.012
Rothstein.

49:38.080 --> 49:39.914
Rothstein.

49:39.948 --> 49:42.183
<i>( hangs up )</i>

49:43.786 --> 49:45.820
<i>( car approaching )</i>

49:54.697 --> 49:58.299
<i>( gulls calling )</i>

50:07.577 --> 50:09.178
Made it out.

50:09.212 --> 50:11.213
Hiding in the closet.

50:11.247 --> 50:13.115
Whatever you had to do.

50:13.149 --> 50:17.253
That guy with the mask,
what the fuck was that?

50:24.361 --> 50:25.861
Can't go to New York.

50:25.896 --> 50:28.430
Not gonna be too welcome there.

50:29.866 --> 50:32.401
So, just a suggestion...

50:32.436 --> 50:34.904
we lay low in the woods.

50:34.938 --> 50:38.040
The... what do you call...
the Poconos.

50:38.075 --> 50:40.743
Get our bearings, fresh air,

50:40.778 --> 50:42.211
figure out our next move.

50:42.246 --> 50:44.714
( imitating Nucky )
Relax, it's a party.

50:44.749 --> 50:47.317
Huh?

50:50.788 --> 50:53.990
I'm making a big decision.

50:54.025 --> 50:56.059
From now on,

50:56.093 --> 50:59.229
I'm only selling hooch
every other Thursday.

50:59.264 --> 51:02.165
Because I have important friends.

51:02.200 --> 51:04.601
I'm an important person.

51:04.635 --> 51:09.272
I have important garters holding
up my very important socks.

51:09.306 --> 51:12.041
Do you have any idea

51:12.076 --> 51:14.511
who the fuck I am?

51:14.545 --> 51:16.279
Do you?

51:16.313 --> 51:19.148
Do you?

51:19.182 --> 51:21.951
- You're Nucky Thompson.
- I'm Barney Google.

51:21.985 --> 51:24.554
With the goo-goo-
googly eyes.

51:24.621 --> 51:27.256
And I never, ever

51:27.290 --> 51:31.093
take anything personal.

51:34.964 --> 51:37.232
( laughing )

51:41.003 --> 51:43.537
( normal voice ) Fuck 'em all, huh?

51:44.873 --> 51:47.574
I came here with nothing.

51:47.608 --> 51:49.876
How do you lose what you never had?

51:49.910 --> 51:51.644
Start over.

51:51.679 --> 51:54.247
What this country's all about, right?

51:55.983 --> 51:58.084
So we head west.

51:58.119 --> 52:00.920
Find some hick burg.

52:00.955 --> 52:03.723
Blow 'em right over.
How hard could that be?

52:06.260 --> 52:08.829
Couple of speaks,

52:08.863 --> 52:11.465
truck in some girls,

52:11.499 --> 52:15.870
keep the whole operation

54:08.453 --> 54:10.554
Take him back to Masseria.

54:10.588 --> 54:14.223
Let him know this could be the
end of the problems between us.

54:14.258 --> 54:16.426
Or the beginning.

54:16.460 --> 54:18.728
I'll oblige him either way.

54:18.762 --> 54:21.030
Is that clear?

54:24.567 --> 54:28.504
Tonino, I see you
in Atlantic City again,

54:28.571 --> 54:31.806
I'll kill you myself.

54:42.951 --> 54:46.554
I don't want anyone knowing who I am.

54:46.588 --> 54:49.890
I don't want anyone
looking into my business.

54:51.393 --> 54:54.194
I don't want anyone coming near us

54:54.229 --> 54:56.430
we don't already trust.

55:02.604 --> 55:04.738
Okay, brother.

That's all.

55:46.185 --> 55:48.386
Can we do that?

55:54.392 --> 55:56.927
I'm not going to...

55:56.961 --> 55:59.663
I would never hurt you.

55:59.698 --> 56:01.932
I'm your husband.

56:01.967 --> 56:04.969
I'm the only father
Teddy and Emily have.

56:05.003 --> 56:08.338
I'm willing to forgive you

56:08.373 --> 56:11.174
for whatever happened in the past.

56:12.677 --> 56:15.512
For whatever you felt a need to do.

56:15.546 --> 56:19.750
<i>I forgive you.</i>
<i>And it's time to come home.</i>

56:34.131 --> 56:35.999
To submit yourself to this?

56:36.033 --> 56:38.768
Out of what, spite?

56:38.803 --> 56:41.871
<i>It doesn't make sense.</i>

56:43.507 --> 56:46.142
Your life is with me.

56:46.177 --> 56:48.912
You're spoiled for anything else.

56:48.946 --> 56:53.249
<i>You need to ask yourself how much</i>
<i>you're willing to sacrifice</i>

56:53.284 --> 56:56.719

that doesn't matter to anyone.

57:13.101 --> 57:15.203
Nobody's watching now.

57:15.237 --> 57:16.738
Nobody's judging.

57:16.806 --> 57:19.675
Take this

57:19.742 --> 57:21.810
for the children.

57:21.845 --> 57:23.846
Or take it for yourself.

57:23.880 --> 57:25.782
You don't have to pretend with me.

57:25.816 --> 57:28.251
Take it

57:28.285 --> 57:30.987
and decide later.

57:31.021 --> 57:33.189
This is only money.

57:33.223 --> 57:36.058
