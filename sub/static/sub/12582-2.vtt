<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:31.948 --> 00:33.438
Yep.

00:33.483 --> 00:35.917
Yep.

00:35.952 --> 00:40.245
Nancy refused to make me eggs
Benedict for breakfast again.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.588
It's not fair.
I'm a good husband.

00:42.625 --> 00:45.253
The ones who kill their wives
and go to Death Row

00:45.295 --> 00:47.024
get to eat whatever they want.

00:47.063 --> 00:49.463
People on Death Row
get to eat whatever they want?

00:49.499 --> 00:51.694
For their last meal, yes.

00:51.735 --> 00:54.727
Oh. I could never kill anybody.

00:57.974 --> 00:59.236
Oh, man.

00:59.275 --> 01:00.742
That's like with
them noise pollution

01:00.777 --> 01:02.836
Man, like them dang
ole band Garbage, man.

01:02.879 --> 01:05.404
Ol' lead sing kinda cute,
but, you know, look, man.

01:05.447 --> 01:06.745
Dang it, Bobby.

01:06.783 --> 01:10.219
I let Joseph listen
to whatever he wants.

01:10.253 --> 01:13.381
'Course, I'm afraid of Joseph.

01:13.423 --> 01:14.481
♪ ...Such a bad ass... ♪

01:14.524 --> 01:15.616
Bobby.

01:22.031 --> 01:23.623
Dad, what are you doing?

01:23.666 --> 01:25.793
Whoa, I gotta sit down.

01:25.835 --> 01:27.735
What in the heck
is on your head?

01:27.771 --> 01:28.897
They're my dreads.

01:28.938 --> 01:30.030
Aren't they cool?

01:30.073 --> 01:31.631
♪ Uh, uh, uh... ♪

01:33.877 --> 01:36.437
Now, I know you've
got a rule about wigs,

01:36.479 --> 01:39.710
but this is just temporary
until I can grow my own,

01:39.749 --> 01:41.239
just like Johnny Glockk.

01:41.284 --> 01:43.013
Isn't that the guy
who got arrested

01:43.052 --> 01:45.384
for setting a car on fire?

01:45.421 --> 01:48.254
He had to, Dad...
he got dissed.

01:48.291 --> 01:50.418
Bobby, here's the
goatee you wanted.

01:50.460 --> 01:53.452
Thanks. Oh... what
about the black nail polish?

01:53.496 --> 01:54.520
They were out.

01:54.564 --> 01:56.498
You will have to
use a Sharpie.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.865
No. The only way
you're having a black nail

01:58.902 --> 02:00.597
is if you hit it
with a hammer.

02:00.637 --> 02:02.434
Why are you
encouraging our son

02:02.472 --> 02:03.996
to dress like a criminal?

02:04.040 --> 02:05.974
Oh, he's just playing, Hank.

02:06.009 --> 02:07.408
Gangstas and hos

02:07.443 --> 02:10.435
is his generation's
cowboys and Indians.

02:10.479 --> 02:12.243
That's what I'm talking about.

02:13.783 --> 02:15.717
<i>What's the big deal?</i>

02:15.752 --> 02:17.743
I was just rocking out
to my music.

02:17.787 --> 02:20.187
If you're looking for
some entertainment,

02:20.223 --> 02:23.454
I do have a very awesome video
that you might enjoy.

02:23.493 --> 02:25.757
If it's the one
about Esau the Eggplant

02:25.795 --> 02:29.561
and the prodigal cucumber, I've
seen it about a thousand times.

02:29.599 --> 02:30.793
I hear your beef.

02:30.834 --> 02:33.029
You're a teenager
and you're looking

02:33.069 --> 02:35.367
for something a
little more with it.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.667
I got your back.

02:36.706 --> 02:39.140
Hank, I know an after-
school youth group

02:39.175 --> 02:40.665
that would be great for Bobby.

02:40.710 --> 02:44.202
The pastor there has done
some super work with teens.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.441
Youth group?

02:45.481 --> 02:47.039
Sounds kinda boring.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.516
Sounds kinda perfect.

02:48.551 --> 02:51.748
Some positive influence
is just what Bobby needs.

02:51.788 --> 02:53.255
But, Dad, it's after school.

02:53.289 --> 02:55.257
What if I want
to join a sports team?

02:55.291 --> 02:56.417
Nice try.

02:56.459 --> 02:57.585
He'll be there.

02:58.895 --> 03:01.762
I can't believe you're
making me do this.

03:01.798 --> 03:02.958
It's so uncool.

03:02.999 --> 03:05.524
You know what's
not cool, Bobby?

03:05.568 --> 03:06.728
Hell.

03:09.239 --> 03:10.672
Don't forget your Bible.

03:31.394 --> 03:32.588
What are you looking at?

03:32.629 --> 03:34.358
Hey, there, guys.

03:34.397 --> 03:36.126
I was just, uh...

03:36.165 --> 03:37.291
What's with the suit?

03:37.333 --> 03:38.595
You a lawyer, suit?

03:38.635 --> 03:41.103
No, uh...
I-I-I don't want any trouble.

03:41.137 --> 03:43.697
I was just looking
for... uh...

03:43.740 --> 03:45.367
What <i>are</i> you looking for?

03:45.408 --> 03:46.432
I, um...

03:46.476 --> 03:47.738
You lost?

03:47.777 --> 03:49.642
Lonely? Scared?

03:49.679 --> 03:50.407
Yes!

03:50.446 --> 03:51.470
Well, then you came

03:51.514 --> 03:52.572
to the right place.

03:53.917 --> 03:56.408
Look, K's dropping in
for a Double Ore-Ida.

03:59.289 --> 04:00.654
Praise Him!

04:02.625 --> 04:04.923
That was awesome.

04:04.961 --> 04:07.088
Thanks, but not
as awesome as Jesus.

04:07.130 --> 04:09.724
You guys are
the Christian youth group?

04:11.100 --> 04:12.397
Pastor K.

04:12.435 --> 04:14.096
Stroup said she was
sending over a kid

04:14.137 --> 04:15.604
who likes to rock out. That you?

04:15.638 --> 04:16.935
Yeah.

04:16.973 --> 04:18.600
Welcome to the flock.

04:18.641 --> 04:20.608
Word to our Father.

04:20.642 --> 04:21.563
Hosanna to the highest.

04:22.779 --> 04:27.773
See, check out what this lucky
bastard got for his last meal.

04:27.817 --> 04:29.751
Prisoner number 88725.

04:29.786 --> 04:34.246
Six pieces of fried chicken,
six rolls, tin roof ice cream,

04:34.290 --> 04:36.588
strawberry soda and lemon pie.

04:36.626 --> 04:37.923
Oh, that sounds good.

04:37.961 --> 04:39.952
That's what I want.

04:39.996 --> 04:41.224
How about this guy?

04:41.264 --> 04:43.630
One dozen fried eggs,
one loaf of bread,

04:43.666 --> 04:46.533
a bowl of salad dressing,
French fries

04:46.569 --> 04:48.594
and three cartons of milk.

04:48.638 --> 04:49.605
Oh, no.

04:49.639 --> 04:51.129
<i>That's</i> what I want.

04:51.174 --> 04:53.904
If it were me, I'd choose
the world's rarest truffle.

04:53.943 --> 04:56.343
Then, while they
were searching for it,

04:56.379 --> 04:58.210
I'd tunnel my way to freedom.

04:58.247 --> 05:01.842
'Course then I'd miss eating
the world's rarest truffle.

05:01.884 --> 05:03.044
Quite the quandary.

05:03.086 --> 05:04.383
I'll tell you what, man.

05:04.420 --> 05:06.388
Talking bout I'd go out
in dang old style, man.

05:06.422 --> 05:08.754
You know, talking bout dang
ole rack of lamb, you know,

05:08.791 --> 05:10.190
and a little ole foie gras.

05:11.160 --> 05:12.354
Dang ol' dinner is served.

05:12.395 --> 05:13.362
Sorry I'm late.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.727
The Weather Channel's got

05:14.764 --> 05:16.857
some pretty exciting stuff
going on in Missouri.

05:18.901 --> 05:20.732
I felt like walking home.

05:20.770 --> 05:23.933
You know, enjoy
this glorious day.

05:23.973 --> 05:26.635
So, uh, you have a good time?

05:26.676 --> 05:29.304
Yes, it was the best.

05:29.345 --> 05:30.539
I met some great guys,

05:30.580 --> 05:32.548
and I asked them
to come over later,

05:32.582 --> 05:33.742
if that's okay?

05:33.783 --> 05:35.410
Well, of course it's okay.

05:35.451 --> 05:37.544
I'll even set up
the tether ball.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.681
Thanks for making me go, Dad.

05:40.723 --> 05:44.557
My son just thanked me
for taking him to church.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.233
Yes, I switched.

05:52.268 --> 05:53.428
Do not start.

05:54.670 --> 05:55.637
Possum.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.467
What the?

05:58.508 --> 06:01.341
What are you guys doing
to that garbage can?

06:01.377 --> 06:03.504
That is not its intended use.

06:03.546 --> 06:04.706
Hey, guys!

06:04.747 --> 06:06.806
Bobby, don't get too close.

06:06.849 --> 06:08.009
What are you talking about?

06:08.051 --> 06:09.746
These are my friends
from the youth group.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.414
They're cool,
and they're totally Christian.

06:12.455 --> 06:13.854
Hey, check this out.
All right.

06:13.890 --> 06:14.948
Yeah.

06:14.991 --> 06:16.982
I... I don't understand.

06:17.026 --> 06:18.516
Hey, dude, I'm up.

06:18.561 --> 06:19.619
Can you hold my Bible?

06:19.662 --> 06:21.857
Uh...

06:21.898 --> 06:22.956
You don't have
to just hold it.

06:22.999 --> 06:24.023
You could read it, you know.

06:24.067 --> 06:25.898
Don't tell <i>me</i> to read the Bible.

06:26.969 --> 06:28.937
Praise Him!

06:28.971 --> 06:30.165
Praise Him!

06:37.713 --> 06:39.613
Can you believe the way
that kid was sassing me?

06:39.649 --> 06:41.947
I was reading the Bible

06:41.984 --> 06:42.780
before that little
punk was born.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.116
Maybe it's just me,

06:44.153 --> 06:46.417
but I'd rather Bobby
be in a Christian gang

06:46.456 --> 06:48.321
than one of those
murdering gangs.

06:48.357 --> 06:49.949
Well, maybe you're right.

06:49.992 --> 06:52.552
Wait, I-I think
that one is smoking.

06:52.595 --> 06:55.496
Oh, no, he's praying.

06:55.531 --> 06:57.624
<i>Thanks for having me</i>

06:57.667 --> 06:58.691
over for dinner.

06:58.734 --> 07:00.668
Mine was a disaster.

07:00.703 --> 07:03.433
I thought hot dogs
never went bad.

07:03.473 --> 07:06.408
Would anybody mind
if I said grace tonight?

07:06.442 --> 07:08.342
Sure, Bobby.

07:08.377 --> 07:09.844
I want to give a shout-out

07:09.879 --> 07:11.847
to the man who
makes it all happen.

07:11.881 --> 07:14.372
Props be to you
for this most bountiful meal

07:14.417 --> 07:15.816
that sits before us.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.319
Okay, check it.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.253
God, you've got skills.

07:19.288 --> 07:20.516
You represent

07:20.556 --> 07:22.251
in these vegetables
and in this napkin

07:22.291 --> 07:24.054
and in the dirt
that grows the grain

07:24.093 --> 07:25.720
that makes
the garlic bread sticks

07:25.761 --> 07:28.457
that are on this table today,
yes, yes.

07:28.498 --> 07:30.591
Okay, Bobby.

07:30.633 --> 07:32.157
God appreciates the support,

07:32.201 --> 07:34.465
but I'm sure He wouldn't want
the pot roast to get cold.

07:34.504 --> 07:35.630
Now, let's wrap it up.

07:35.671 --> 07:36.695
Sure thing.

07:36.739 --> 07:39.071
Thanks, J-Man. Peace.

07:47.850 --> 07:49.715
What up, James?

07:49.752 --> 07:51.481
Peace be with you, Brad.

07:51.521 --> 07:53.182
Hey, Bobby, check it out.

07:55.057 --> 07:56.422
Righteous!

07:56.459 --> 07:58.154
You should see Pastor K's ride.

07:58.194 --> 07:59.286
He's got the Resurrection

07:59.328 --> 08:01.091
airbrushed
on the back of his Jeep.

08:01.130 --> 08:03.155
Hey, brothers, gather 'round.

08:03.199 --> 08:04.894
Time to feel the Word.

08:04.934 --> 08:06.595
Welcome, everybody.

08:06.636 --> 08:08.866
Trent, you got our
verse of the day?

08:10.239 --> 08:12.070
"Test all things.

08:12.108 --> 08:14.668
Hold fast what is good."

08:14.710 --> 08:17.873
Thessalonians 5:21.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.404
Nice job, brother.

08:19.448 --> 08:21.177
That verse was running
through my spirit

08:21.217 --> 08:22.912
when I went
rock climbing last weekend.

08:22.952 --> 08:24.214
To be tight with the Lord,

08:24.253 --> 08:26.585
you got to take your faith
to the limit.

08:26.622 --> 08:27.179
You know what
I'm talking about?

08:27.223 --> 08:28.155
The power!

08:28.191 --> 08:29.158
That's right.

08:29.192 --> 08:30.819
Nothing runs without power.

08:30.860 --> 08:33.419
I mean, your amp is worthless
unless it gets that juice.

08:33.462 --> 08:35.225
And so are we.

08:35.264 --> 08:37.494
So you got to find
a way to plug in.

08:37.533 --> 08:39.899
Test all things
to find the good.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.698
But how do you know what's good?

08:41.736 --> 08:43.864
It's whatever sticks
to your spirit, man.

08:43.905 --> 08:45.703
Whatever God
tattoos on your soul.

08:45.741 --> 08:48.039
We're all searching
for that eternal ink.

08:49.745 --> 08:52.111
All right, let us pray.

08:52.148 --> 08:54.742
And don't forget to say
a little something for Charlie

08:54.784 --> 08:56.664
who's at home with a wicked
nose ring infection.

09:02.091 --> 09:03.080
What in?

09:04.827 --> 09:06.761
Oh, I thought
he had it that time.

09:06.796 --> 09:09.458
I don't know what to make of
this youth group of Bobby's.

09:09.498 --> 09:11.159
Last night he broke curfew,

09:11.200 --> 09:12.758
but he was up
reading the Bible.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.270
What do you do with that?

09:15.304 --> 09:17.101
Maybe you should punish
him Old Testament style.

09:17.139 --> 09:20.802
A religious boy like Bobby
would appreciate the irony.

09:20.843 --> 09:22.037
Bobby, take that off.

09:22.078 --> 09:23.477
You can't wear
a T-shirt

09:23.512 --> 09:25.309
with that word on it.

09:25.348 --> 09:27.407
Such vulgarity.

09:27.450 --> 09:30.613
Wait, which word, Hank...
Satan or sucks?

09:30.653 --> 09:32.553
Well... either.

09:32.588 --> 09:34.453
Why not, Dad?

09:34.490 --> 09:35.422
Satan does suck.

09:35.458 --> 09:36.482
I know, but...

09:36.525 --> 09:37.651
He's right, Hank.

09:37.693 --> 09:39.888
What does your shirt
say, "Satan Rules"?

09:43.833 --> 09:45.460
So I was thinking.

09:45.501 --> 09:48.368
Why do criminals get
to have all the good food

09:48.404 --> 09:49.666
and we get nothing?

09:49.705 --> 09:52.674
Bill, you pay taxes,
aren't you outraged?

09:52.708 --> 09:53.697
Yes, I am!

09:53.743 --> 09:55.005
You know what?

09:55.044 --> 09:57.569
We should have
our own last meals.

09:57.613 --> 09:59.410
Hey man, talkin' 'bout
let's go over my place, man.

09:59.448 --> 10:01.177
It'd be just like a dang ol'
breakfast club, man,

10:01.217 --> 10:03.117
'cept we're going for dinner
instead, you know, like,

10:03.152 --> 10:05.279
like, got no Judd
Nelson either, man.

10:05.321 --> 10:06.652
There you go!

10:06.689 --> 10:08.680
The first meeting
of the Last Meal Club

10:08.724 --> 10:10.954
convenes at Boomhauer's!

10:12.428 --> 10:14.919
I love it when we do things!

10:14.964 --> 10:16.829
And then Cain was all like,

10:16.866 --> 10:19.699
"I ain't supposed to be
looking out for my bro, yo."

10:19.735 --> 10:22.260
I didn't know
that was in Genesis.

10:22.305 --> 10:25.103
Bobby, you are so good
at this.

10:25.141 --> 10:27.837
I owe it all
to my <i>Extreme Teen Bible</i>.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.538
And Pastor K.

10:29.578 --> 10:32.877
He wrote a 22-minute song
about the Disciples.

10:32.915 --> 10:34.974
And if he can remember
all the words,

10:35.017 --> 10:37.508
he's going to play it
at Messiah Fest.

10:37.553 --> 10:39.282
Wow, Messiah Fest!

10:39.322 --> 10:41.017
Are you going to go?

10:41.057 --> 10:43.150
Uh, I don't know
if Dad'll let me.

10:43.192 --> 10:44.625
It'll take a miracle

10:44.660 --> 10:46.218
to make him come around,

10:46.262 --> 10:48.958
but I guess that's what
the Bible is all about.

10:48.998 --> 10:51.364
Can I get
a what-what?

10:54.236 --> 10:55.225
Yeah.

10:55.271 --> 10:56.898
Hear the Word.

10:56.939 --> 10:58.702
Rejoice.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.038
Uh-huh.

11:01.944 --> 11:03.138
Yeah. Uh-huh.

11:03.179 --> 11:04.271
What were you doing
there, brother?

11:04.313 --> 11:06.474
Sorry, I was just
feeling the spirit.

11:06.515 --> 11:08.176
No, man, it works.

11:08.217 --> 11:11.152
That's just what I need to help
spread the fire at Messiah Fest.

11:11.187 --> 11:13.052
How'd you feel
about backing me up?

11:13.089 --> 11:15.387
On stage?

11:15.424 --> 11:16.823
Relax, brother.

11:18.027 --> 11:19.494
Listen, when I get
nervous before a gig,

11:19.528 --> 11:21.018
I just look at this.

11:23.466 --> 11:25.400
Cool.

11:28.404 --> 11:31.430
Hey, Dad, what do you
think of this?

11:31.474 --> 11:34.102
Well, Bobby, it's,
uh, so, uh...

11:34.143 --> 11:35.371
What am I looking at?

11:35.411 --> 11:37.311
It's my tattoo.

11:37.346 --> 11:39.610
No got dang way.

11:39.648 --> 11:40.842
Dad, it's okay.

11:40.883 --> 11:42.475
This is what you do now

11:42.518 --> 11:45.385
when you want to give
mad respect to the Lord.

11:45.421 --> 11:47.218
The Lord has been
getting mad respect

11:47.256 --> 11:48.621
since the beginning of time.

11:48.657 --> 11:50.625
He doesn't need you
defacing your body.

11:50.659 --> 11:53.025
But...

11:53.062 --> 11:54.086
No son of mine
is getting a tattoo.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.256
End of discussion.

11:57.133 --> 12:00.034
Hey, I know what this is.

12:00.069 --> 12:01.263
It's a test.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.964
Like with Job.

12:03.005 --> 12:05.701
You rascal!

12:10.079 --> 12:11.808
You know that comedian's joke

12:11.847 --> 12:15.044
about how you always get
the cart with a wobbly wheel?

12:15.084 --> 12:16.210
It's so true.

12:16.252 --> 12:18.083
I love that comedian.

12:19.688 --> 12:21.781
Hmm, I still not sure.

12:21.824 --> 12:25.385
Hey, hillbillies.

12:25.428 --> 12:26.918
Why so much in cart?

12:26.962 --> 12:28.896
Food stamps expire today?

12:28.931 --> 12:29.920
No.

12:29.965 --> 12:31.694
We're cooking our last meals.

12:31.734 --> 12:34.066
Why should you have
to kill somebody

12:34.103 --> 12:35.570
just to get some
decent food around here?

12:35.604 --> 12:37.196
Bah, you wouldn't know...

12:37.239 --> 12:38.797
Hey, is that filo dough?

12:38.841 --> 12:40.866
Talkin' 'bout spana-dang
ol' kopita man.

12:40.910 --> 12:44.402
Hmm, the quest
for the perfect meal.

12:44.447 --> 12:46.881
Of course it must
start with shrimp.

12:48.951 --> 12:52.045
Dead man eating...
shrimp!

12:57.693 --> 12:59.752
Why didn't Jesus catch me?

12:59.795 --> 13:01.262
He has a plan for you.

13:01.297 --> 13:03.231
The Miller Flip
just isn't part of it yet.

13:04.533 --> 13:06.262
Are you Pastor K?

13:06.302 --> 13:07.428
Yeah, brother.

13:07.470 --> 13:08.801
I'm Bobby Hill's father,

13:08.838 --> 13:10.430
and I want to talk to you
about this garbage

13:10.473 --> 13:12.566
you're teaching my boy.

13:12.608 --> 13:13.973
Well, hold up.

13:14.009 --> 13:15.033
You don't want me teaching
your son about God?

13:15.077 --> 13:16.601
Well, that part's fine.

13:16.645 --> 13:17.839
It's the other junk.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.973
The obscene clothing,
the tattoos...

13:20.015 --> 13:21.277
Dude, you don't have to act

13:21.317 --> 13:22.784
or dress a certain
way for God.

13:22.818 --> 13:25.514
You can hang with Him
anyway, anywhere.

13:25.554 --> 13:27.818
Don't you think Jesus is right
here on this half pipe?

13:27.857 --> 13:30.724
I'm sure He's a lot of places
He doesn't want to be.

13:30.759 --> 13:32.420
What's more important...

13:32.461 --> 13:34.827
that Bobby's a Christian or
that he has a <i>proper</i> haircut?

13:34.864 --> 13:36.559
I'm not giving up on either.

13:36.599 --> 13:38.328
Now stay away from my boy.

13:40.703 --> 13:42.534
Pharaoh's on our tail, Mom.

13:42.571 --> 13:43.833
My strength is low.

13:43.873 --> 13:45.465
I need some milk and honey.

13:45.508 --> 13:46.497
That's enough.

13:46.542 --> 13:47.509
This whole thing

13:47.543 --> 13:48.737
stops now.

13:48.777 --> 13:50.005
You're getting rid
of all this stuff

13:50.045 --> 13:51.273
and you're going to church

13:51.313 --> 13:53.372
in a suit and tie
like we've always done.

13:53.415 --> 13:54.643
But Pastor K says...

13:54.683 --> 13:56.810
And you can forget
about that Pastor K.

13:56.852 --> 13:58.843
Woo! I am out of Egypt!

13:58.888 --> 14:01.015
And look at Moses dance!

14:01.056 --> 14:02.853
Peggy, this is serious.

14:02.892 --> 14:04.826
Oh, Hank, you are overreacting.

14:04.860 --> 14:08.023
These are good Christian kids
having good Christian fun.

14:08.063 --> 14:09.690
You think <i>this</i> is fun?

14:09.732 --> 14:11.757
He looks like a burglar.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.233
What?

14:13.269 --> 14:14.998
What's that in your ear?

14:15.037 --> 14:16.504
My testimonial.

14:16.539 --> 14:18.473
No. Uh-uh.
That's an earring.

14:18.507 --> 14:19.735
You're grounded, mister.

14:19.775 --> 14:22.073
But Messiah Fest
is this afternoon.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.511
I'm Pastor K's backup guy.

14:24.547 --> 14:25.844
Mom?

14:25.881 --> 14:27.906
I was on board with
baptizing Ladybird,

14:27.950 --> 14:29.008
but how could you destroy

14:29.051 --> 14:30.712
those perfect little
ears I gave you?

14:30.753 --> 14:31.742
Hand it over.

14:38.260 --> 14:42.959
You guys just don't understand
how I feel about Jesus!

15:01.584 --> 15:02.983
Messiah Fest.

15:03.018 --> 15:05.680
When I was young,

15:05.721 --> 15:07.052
you went to rock and roll
concerts on Saturday night

15:07.089 --> 15:09.080
and asked for forgiveness
on Sunday.

15:09.124 --> 15:11.058
Now it's all mixed together.

15:11.093 --> 15:12.492
I don't know, Hank.

15:12.528 --> 15:15.088
Something about scraping off
that bumper sticker

15:15.130 --> 15:16.757
seems a little sacrilegious.

15:16.799 --> 15:19.461
Bobby loves God,
you worship the devil.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.298
Dinners must be tense.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.464
This has nothing to do
with religion.

15:23.505 --> 15:25.803
I've always been
against vandalism,

15:25.841 --> 15:28.401
be it on my bumper
or in my son's ear.

15:28.444 --> 15:30.309
I'm just setting things right.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.644
Now I'm going to finish
the job in Bobby's room.

15:33.983 --> 15:36.577
How many Footprints
posters does a kid need?

15:40.389 --> 15:41.754
Bobby?

15:44.727 --> 15:47.719
Ah, damn, his Bible's gone.

15:56.772 --> 15:59.036
Praise him! Praise him!

16:00.809 --> 16:03.004
Pastor K, what do you think?

16:03.045 --> 16:05.513
Sharp.

16:05.547 --> 16:07.037
Well, I better go now.

16:07.082 --> 16:09.414
One of the bands
asked me to leave

16:09.451 --> 16:11.851
before I give
them impure thoughts.

16:11.887 --> 16:15.288
Hey, K, dig the chain. New?

16:15.324 --> 16:17.053
Yeah. Thanks, Pop.

16:17.092 --> 16:18.684
That was your dad?

16:18.727 --> 16:20.319
Yeah, he's a roadie
for The A-Men.

16:20.362 --> 16:21.659
They've been
spreading the word

16:21.697 --> 16:23.062
across North America
all summer.

16:23.098 --> 16:24.065
So, you ready to rock?

16:24.099 --> 16:25.327
Let's do it.

16:26.935 --> 16:30.735

16:46.455 --> 16:48.252
eats like this every night.

16:48.290 --> 16:53.057
I would be proud to make this
sumptuous banquet my last meal.

16:54.463 --> 16:56.158
Bon appetit!

16:56.198 --> 16:59.964
Remember, after this, the
next flavor in your mouth

17:00.002 --> 17:02.436
will be the sour taste of death.

17:06.141 --> 17:07.108
Oh...

17:07.142 --> 17:08.733
No, no.

17:10.345 --> 17:13.781

Oh, coming!
Yeah, you hear that?

17:32.534 --> 17:33.728

17:35.437 --> 17:36.768
Whoa.

17:38.440 --> 17:40.340

17:40.375 --> 17:42.775
Yeah, but... don't...

17:42.811 --> 17:45.609

17:53.489 --> 17:54.854
Mm, shrimp.

I say Holy,

18:02.931 --> 18:03.898
you say Ghost.

18:03.932 --> 18:05.194
- Holy!
- Ghost!

18:05.234 --> 18:05.859

18:27.923 --> 18:30.187
Dad, we're in the middle
of the show!

18:30.225 --> 18:31.658
Well, I hope you enjoyed it,

18:31.693 --> 18:34.389
'cause it's the last time
you're leaving your room

18:34.429 --> 18:35.453
until you graduate.

18:35.497 --> 18:36.623
Now, let's go.

18:38.133 --> 18:40.465
Hey, what's up?
We still have another set.

18:40.502 --> 18:42.231
I'm taking my son home.

18:42.271 --> 18:43.761
I can't believe you, Dad.

18:43.806 --> 18:46.536
You're embarrassing me
in front of the pastor!

18:46.575 --> 18:48.202
Mr. Hill, you just don't get it.

18:48.243 --> 18:49.801
This is how we testify.

18:49.845 --> 18:51.540
♪♪ Praise him! ♪♪

18:53.015 --> 18:55.313
Can't you see you're not making
Christianity better?

18:55.350 --> 18:57.580
You're just making
rock and roll worse.

18:57.619 --> 18:59.086
You people are all the same.

18:59.121 --> 19:01.146
You look at us
and think we're freaks.

19:01.190 --> 19:03.055
Come on,
even Jesus had long hair.

19:03.091 --> 19:05.184
Only because I wasn't his dad.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.218
Is there a problem here, K?

19:07.262 --> 19:08.354
Yeah, Pop.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.490
This dude
won't let Bobby praise J.C.

19:10.532 --> 19:11.897
And he's ruining my show.

19:12.801 --> 19:14.234
Look, I just want my son

19:14.269 --> 19:15.600
back in regular church

19:15.637 --> 19:18.299
obeying his normal parents
and acting right.

19:18.340 --> 19:20.433
See, Pop,
he's holding him back.

19:20.475 --> 19:21.942
What're you doing, Kevin?

19:21.977 --> 19:23.774
You forgot Number Five.

19:23.812 --> 19:24.403
Huh?

19:28.650 --> 19:31.278
Never come between
a kid and his dad.

19:31.320 --> 19:35.416
If the man doesn't want his boy
praising like you, it's cool.

19:35.457 --> 19:37.152
Yeah, but...
Now go finish your show

19:37.192 --> 19:39.285
before they start
mashing out of anger

19:39.328 --> 19:41.193
instead of jubilation.

19:41.230 --> 19:42.356
Fine.

19:42.397 --> 19:43.955
Sorry about that, friend.

19:43.999 --> 19:45.432
Oh, that's okay.

19:45.467 --> 19:48.061
I got to admit, when you first
walked up I didn't think

19:48.103 --> 19:50.230
you and I were going to be
on the same page.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.967
I feel where
you're coming from.

19:52.007 --> 19:53.304
Teenagers.

19:53.342 --> 19:54.206
Amen.

19:55.477 --> 19:56.808
Let's go, Bobby.

20:01.984 --> 20:04.077
You can give me the
stink eye all you want,

20:04.119 --> 20:06.019
but it's not going
to change anything.

20:06.054 --> 20:07.544
Fine.
But when I'm 18,

20:07.589 --> 20:10.820
I'm going to do
whatever I want for the Lord.

20:10.859 --> 20:13.657
Tattoos, piercings, the works.

20:13.695 --> 20:15.629
Well, I'll take that chance.

20:15.664 --> 20:18.098
Come here, there's
something I want to show you.

20:20.969 --> 20:23.130
Remember this?

20:23.171 --> 20:24.604
My Bean Bag Buddy?

20:24.640 --> 20:28.235
Oh, man, I can't believe
I collected those things.

20:28.277 --> 20:29.437
They're so lame.

20:29.478 --> 20:32.345
You didn't think so
five years ago.

20:32.381 --> 20:34.349
And how about
your virtual pet?

20:34.383 --> 20:36.146
You used to carry
this thing everywhere.

20:36.184 --> 20:37.344
Then you got tired of it,

20:37.386 --> 20:39.286
forgot to feed
it, and it died.

20:39.321 --> 20:43.189
I look like such a dork.

20:43.225 --> 20:44.783
I know how you feel.

20:46.662 --> 20:49.130
I never thought that
Members Only jacket

20:49.164 --> 20:50.358
would go out of style.

20:50.399 --> 20:51.889
But it did.

20:51.934 --> 20:54.596
I know you think that stuff
you're doing now is cool,

20:54.636 --> 20:57.230
but in a few years you're
gonna think it's lame.

20:57.272 --> 20:58.637
And I don't want the, uh,

20:58.674 --> 21:02.007
Lord to, uh, you know,
end up in this box.

21:03.478 --> 21:04.638
I got you, Dad.

21:07.883 --> 21:09.748
Hey, what's this picture?

21:09.785 --> 21:12.720
Mom used to have blond hair?

21:12.754 --> 21:16.121
Farrah Fawcett
was very popular back then.

21:16.158 --> 21:20.788
