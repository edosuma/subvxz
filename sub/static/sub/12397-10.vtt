ALL RIGHT.

00:04.500 --> 00:09.301
UH, IT ALL STARTED LAST WEEK,
WITH THE NEW JOB.

00:10.570 --> 00:12.435
SO YOU GET THIS?
TO KEEP?

00:12.480 --> 00:14.505
- NOT TO KEEP.
IT'S A COMPANY CAR.

00:14.540 --> 00:15.734
- BUT YOU CAN DRIVE IT
WHENEVER YOU WANT

00:15.780 --> 00:16.940
AS FAST AS YOU CAN

00:16.980 --> 00:18.504
WITH FULL DIPLOMATIC
IMMUNITY?

00:18.550 --> 00:19.676
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW A COMPANY CAR WORKS?

00:19.720 --> 00:22.348
- IT IS JET-BLACK.
- LIKE ME.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.609
- HOLY LIVING--

00:25.650 --> 00:27.959
GUS, THAT'S FULLY FUNCTIONAL.
- YEP.

00:27.990 --> 00:29.127
- AND YOU'RE CERTAIN
THAT THIS STUFF

00:29.160 --> 00:30.923
I'M EATING IS FLAXSEED?

00:30.960 --> 00:32.120
- I THINK THEY MILL IT
WITH CINNAMON OR SOMETHING.

00:32.160 --> 00:35.618
DON'T USE YOUR HAND, OKAY?

00:35.660 --> 00:36.991
- OH, MY GOD, GUS.

00:37.030 --> 00:38.361
YOU HAVE FOUND
THE ONLY HEALTHY THING

00:38.400 --> 00:40.129

AN ENDLESS SUPPLY RIGHT HERE

00:49.450 --> 00:50.747
OH, THANKS.

00:50.780 --> 00:51.974
- WE ARE OUT
OF THIS STUFF, THOUGH.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.113

00:53.150 --> 00:55.038

ONCE A YEAR

01:03.930 --> 01:06.091

01:06.130 --> 01:08.052
- YOU MOVE FAST, MY FRIEND.

01:08.100 --> 01:10.364
- HER NAME IS "LOVE,"
LITERALLY.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.231
WELL, HER MIDDLE NAME,
BUT LITERALLY.

01:12.270 --> 01:15.034
AND SHE'S SINGLE.

01:15.070 --> 01:16.799
- AND HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU SPOKEN?

01:16.840 --> 01:19.001
- NONE.

01:19.040 --> 01:20.928
I GOT IT OFF
HER COMPANY BIO,

01:20.980 --> 01:23.244
AND I FOLLOW HER
ANONYMOUSLY ON INSTAGRAM.

01:23.280 --> 01:25.874
- IS THIS A LITTLE CREEPY?

01:25.910 --> 01:28.811
- IT COULD BE INTERPRETED
THAT WAY, YES.

01:28.850 --> 01:30.408
[both slurp]

01:32.260 --> 01:34.148
- THAT'S WHEN I KNEW.

01:34.190 --> 01:37.284
THAT'S--
THAT'S WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR.

01:37.330 --> 01:40.959
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S WHEN IT BECAME REAL.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.888
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

01:42.930 --> 01:45.069
IT DIDN'T BECOME REAL
UNTIL I SAID IT OUT LOUD.

01:45.100 --> 01:46.362
I'VE MADE A DECISION.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.095
- ABOUT NEXT WEEKEND?

01:48.140 --> 01:49.903
ARE YOU NOT COMING UP?
'CAUSE I CAN COME DOWN.

01:49.940 --> 01:52.773

01:52.810 --> 01:54.937
- SHAWN, WHAT'S WRONG?

01:54.980 --> 01:56.379
- I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

01:56.410 --> 01:58.799
IT'S TOO HARD.
IT'S--

01:58.850 --> 02:02.240
IT'S FRICKIN' IMPOSSIBLE.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.178
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

02:04.220 --> 02:06.859
- I AM SAYING
THAT I'M GOING

02:06.890 --> 02:10.849
TO MOVE UP THERE
TO BE WITH YOU.

02:10.890 --> 02:14.428
- YOU'RE CLOSING PSYCH.
- YES.

02:14.460 --> 02:17.065
A MAN CAN FOLLOW A WOMAN
BECAUSE HE LOVES HER, OKAY?

02:17.100 --> 02:19.967
THERE IS NO RULE OR LAW
AGAINST THAT.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.365
AND IF THERE WAS,
I WOULD BREAK IT,

02:21.400 --> 02:23.004
AND IT WOULDN'T BE QUIET.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.838
I WOULD DO IT BRAZENLY
AND OUT IN THE OPEN.

02:25.870 --> 02:27.701
- [sighs]
ARE YOU SURE THIS IS RIGHT?

02:27.740 --> 02:29.105
- OH, SWEETHEART,
IT 15 so RIGHT.

02:29.140 --> 02:31.108
I HAVE NEVER BEEN
SO SURE ABOUT ANYTHING.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.103

NO, SOMEONE RAIDED IT,

TO A NEW CHAPTER IN LIFE,

05:45.440 --> 05:47.328
WHICH I FOUND STRANGE
BECAUSE WE WERE DOING SO WELL.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.132

IS WRONG WITH YOU?

06:02.860 --> 06:04.452
- THIS MAN IS MANIPULATING
OUR EMOTIONS

06:04.490 --> 06:07.789
AND MAKING US FEEL BAD ABOUT
OUR OWN PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.

06:07.830 --> 06:09.252
I MEAN, HOW DO WE KNOW
HE DIDN'T DO IT?

06:09.300 --> 06:11.495
- BECAUSE THE BODY
HAS BEEN DEAD FOR TWO HOURS,

06:11.530 --> 06:13.168
AND WE PICKED HIM UP
AT A FUND-RAISER.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.862
- OKAY, BRANNIGAN,
DID ANYONE ELSE SEE HIM THERE?

06:15.900 --> 06:18.960
- YEAH, ABOUT 300 PEOPLE
AND MY WIFE.

06:19.010 --> 06:21.001

06:21.040 --> 06:23.873
ARE WE SURE WE DON'T WANNA
DRAG HER PASTY ASS DOWNTOWN?

TAKE OVER THE SCENE?

WOULD YOU JOIN ME OUTSIDE?

06:29.350 --> 06:31.386
- WHAT? WHAT?

06:31.420 --> 06:32.580
- YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

06:32.620 --> 06:33.587
- [scoffs]
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND

06:33.620 --> 06:35.508
IN A ZILLION YEARS.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.027
- YOU'RE MOVING TO SAN FRANCISCO
TO BE WITH O'HARA,

06:37.060 --> 06:38.687
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL GUSTER.

06:38.730 --> 06:42.393
- OKAY, TWO THINGS: WHAT?
AND WHAT?

06:42.430 --> 06:44.398
- I WAS HEAD DETECTIVE
FOR A REASON, YOU KNOW.

06:44.430 --> 06:46.318
YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD
GET GUSTER OFF KILTER

06:46.370 --> 06:47.735
BY GE'I'I'ING HIM
CLOSE TO A DEAD BODY

06:47.770 --> 06:48.896
AND THAT WOULD SOFI'EN
THE BLOW.

06:48.940 --> 06:49.907
- WELL, WHEN YOU
SAY IT LIKE THAT,

06:49.940 --> 06:51.259
IT IS AWFULLY CALLOUS.

06:51.310 --> 06:53.471
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND
IN THE UNIVERSE.

06:53.510 --> 06:55.478
HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BREAK UP
WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND?

06:55.510 --> 06:57.205
- YOU DON'T TAKE HIM SOMEPLACE

06:57.250 --> 06:59.047
THAT'S GONNA MAKE HIM
SAD OR UNCOMFORTABLE.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.775
YOU TAKE HIM SOMEPLACE
THAT'S GONNA MAKE HIM HAPPY,

07:00.820 --> 07:02.742
FILLED WITH HAPPY MEMORIES--
GOOD MEMORIES.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.189
MEMORIES THAT CAN'T BE TAINTED

07:04.220 --> 07:06.085
BY A SELFISH,
INCONSIDERATE ACT

07:06.120 --> 07:07.951
OF ABANDONING YOUR OLDEST FRIEND
IN THE WORLD.

07:07.990 --> 07:10.527
- OH, LASSIE.

07:10.560 --> 07:13.290
I--YOU JUST SAVED MY LIFE.

07:13.330 --> 07:15.696
- OH, GOD.

07:15.730 --> 07:17.425
OKAY.

07:17.470 --> 07:21.236
LET GO OF ME,
OR I WILL SHOOT YOU.

07:21.270 --> 07:23.329
- [sighs]

07:23.370 --> 07:25.964
- JESUS, COME HERE.

07:26.010 --> 07:28.069
LOOK WHO'S A BIG BOY NOW,
HUH?

07:28.110 --> 07:30.271
THERE'S MY BIG BOY.

07:30.310 --> 07:32.744
GET OUT OF HERE, SERIOUSLY.

07:32.780 --> 07:36.318
- ODD AS IT MAY SEEM,
THAT WAS THE WISEST ADVICE

07:36.350 --> 07:39.012
THAT LASSITER
HAD EVER GIVEN.

07:39.050 --> 07:42.178
TO ME OR ANYONE,
FOR THAT MATTER.

07:46.430 --> 07:48.057
- SO THERE WAS DIRT
ON THE FLOOR

07:48.100 --> 07:51.126
AND DIRT DEEP IN THE FINGERNAILS
OF OUR VICTIM.

07:51.170 --> 07:53.866
THERE WERE SCRATCHES
ON THE HANDS AND CUTS.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.390
THERE WERE TRACES OF DIRT
FROM HEAD TO TOE.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.203
SO WE CAN REASONABLY ASSUME

07:57.240 --> 07:59.777
HE WAS RUSHING
TO UNCOVER SOMETHING OR--

07:59.810 --> 08:02.506
- HE WAS ACTUALLY PIG-PEN
USING THE ALIAS "WARREN DERN."

08:02.550 --> 08:04.279
THANK YOU.

08:04.310 --> 08:06.005
- ANYTHING ELSE?

08:06.050 --> 08:07.278
- THERE WAS ALSO SCAT?

08:07.320 --> 08:08.639
- YES, RACCOON!

08:08.680 --> 08:10.318
I EYEBALLED THAT
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

08:10.350 --> 08:11.988
- THERE WERE TRACES OF MOSS?
- THREE TYPES.

08:12.020 --> 08:13.954
- DID YOU GET THE MUSHROOM?
- WHAT MUSHROOMS?

08:13.990 --> 08:15.184
- TINY FRAGMENTS OF MUSHROOM
UNDER THE NAILS

08:15.220 --> 08:16.619
MIXED IN WITH THE MOSS
AND THE DIRT.

08:16.660 --> 08:18.878
I ONLY MENTION IT
BECAUSE IT'S RARE.

08:18.930 --> 08:20.852
CALLED A PLAYA.
- [gaSPSI

08:20.900 --> 08:23.221
- YEAH, BRIGHT, COLORFUL, CUTE
AS A BUTTON, TASTES LIKE Ass.

08:23.270 --> 08:26.125
- ALL RIGHT, NOW JUST--
JUST WORK WITH ME, OKAY?

08:26.170 --> 08:31.335
SO I TOOK THE TIME HERE
TO CIRCLE THE AREAS

08:31.370 --> 08:33.304
WHERE RACCOONS
MIGHT RUN FREE.

08:33.340 --> 08:35.604
- I'M NEVER
GOING OUTSIDE AGAIN.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.369
- AND THEN
THESE ARE THE SUBSETS

08:37.410 --> 08:39.275
WHERE THE MOSS TYPES
COULD GROW.

08:39.310 --> 08:42.689
BUT YOU FACTOR IN
THIS DELECT ABLE LI'I'I'LE BEAUTY.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.018
THIS RIGHT HERE
IS WHERE OUR VICTIM WAS DIGGING,

08:45.050 --> 08:48.213
GIVE OR TAKE 40 YARDS.

08:48.260 --> 08:49.955
- WELL DONE, BRANNIGAN.

08:49.990 --> 08:53.426
- THANK YOU, SIR.
I LIVE TO SERVE.

08:53.460 --> 08:56.429
- SHAWN, THIS WOMAN
MIGHT MAKE US OBSOLETE.

08:56.460 --> 08:59.566
- NO, WE'VE GOT ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, GUS.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.363
- FOUND IT!

09:01.400 --> 09:04.608
- WHAT?
- NOW, I AM A LITTLE CONFUSED

09:04.640 --> 09:07.200
AS TO WHAT WOULD FIT
IN A HOLE THIS SMALL.

09:07.240 --> 09:08.730
- [Chuckles]
BETSY.

09:08.780 --> 09:10.338
BETSY,
THIS IS WHERE WE COME IN.

09:10.380 --> 09:12.245
SEE, I AM SENSING
THAT THIS HOLE IS IDEAL

09:12.280 --> 09:14.077
FOR A STANDARD-SIZED
PIRATE'S CHEST.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.419
- SHAWN, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
THE GROUND IS DAMP.

09:17.450 --> 09:19.008
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT OUR GUY
WAS SEARCHING FOR

09:19.050 --> 09:21.154
AND FOUND
THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH.

09:21.190 --> 09:23.454
- OH, GUS,
YOU'RE CLEARLY NOT ACCOUNTING

09:23.490 --> 09:25.481
FOR THE POSSIBILITY
OF THE LOST CITY OF ATLANTA.

09:25.530 --> 09:27.418
- ATLANTIS.
- WELL, I'VE HEARD IT BOTH WAYS.

09:27.460 --> 09:29.519
- AND THEY'RE BOTH WRONG.
- ONE OF THEM WAS YOURS.

09:29.560 --> 09:31.824
- UH, THEY'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?
- UNFORTUNATELY, NO.

09:31.870 --> 09:34.361
- EXCUSE ME, CAN WE
AT LEAST DO A BACKGROUND CHECK

09:34.400 --> 09:35.628
TO SEE IF THERE'S A CHANCE
THAT OUR DIGGER

09:35.670 --> 09:36.807
IS 900 YEARS OLD?

09:36.840 --> 09:38.501
- THAT FEELS MORE REASONABLE.

09:38.540 --> 09:41.270
- DUDE, I AM MISSING WORK.

09:41.310 --> 09:43.744
GET US IN THE GAME.
- OKAY.

09:45.550 --> 09:47.040
- THERE'S TWO SETS
OF PRINTS HERE.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.775
ALL RIGHT, NOW OUR GUY
IS A 10 1/2,

09:48.820 --> 09:50.685
BUT THE OTHER SET IS A 12.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.211
SO THAT MEANS,
BASED ON THE WEIGHT IMPRINT,

09:53.260 --> 09:56.559
THAT HIS PARTNER
IS A 6-FOOTER, GIVE OR TAKE.

09:56.590 --> 09:58.922
- WELL, SPENCER, IT WAS
VERY NICE VERY KNOWING YOU,

09:58.960 --> 10:02.123
BUT I THINK WE'VE GOT IT
FROM HERE.

10:02.160 --> 10:03.559
- WHAT?

10:03.600 --> 10:06.296
[truck horn beeps]

10:14.340 --> 10:16.069
THI--
- THIS ROAD HAS A TOLLBOOTH

10:16.110 --> 10:18.908
WITH A CAMERA.

10:18.950 --> 10:22.249
- SO IT TOOK HER
APPROXIMATELY SEVEN MINUTES

10:22.280 --> 10:23.679
TO GET THE PICTURE
OF OUR DEAD GUY

10:23.720 --> 10:25.711
AND HIS UNKNOWN "COCONSPIRATOR"

10:25.750 --> 10:27.479
SITTING RIGHT THERE
IN THE FRONT SEAT.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.489
- DERN AND HIS COCONSPIRATOR
PAID WITH A $50 BILL.

10:30.530 --> 10:31.758
NO USABLE PRINTS.

10:31.790 --> 10:33.553
- OH, GOOD,
BECAUSE I WAS SENSING--

10:33.600 --> 10:35.249
- BUT THE BILL WAS CRISP ENOUGH
THAT I THOUGHT

10:35.300 --> 10:37.598
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
RECENTLY FED FROM AN ATM.

10:37.630 --> 10:40.360
SO I CROSS-CHECKED A FEW CAMERAS
OUTSIDE LOCAL BANKS.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.267
- [Chuckles] THERE IS NO WAY
THAT COULD HAVE WORKED.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.709
- NOPE.
NOT THIS FAST.

10:44.740 --> 10:47.174
- NAME: KLAUS GOEDECKE.

10:47.210 --> 10:48.973
SIZE 12 WIDE.

10:49.010 --> 10:50.546
RAPIDLY IMPROVING
RAP SHEET.

10:50.580 --> 10:53.674
RECENTLY MADE
A SIZABLE CASH DEPOSIT.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.280
- WELL, AT LEAST IT WAS JUST
A NAME AND ONE BANK DEPOSIT,

10:56.320 --> 10:59.448
SO I STILL HAD A LITTLE
MORE TIME TO BREAK THE NEWS.

10:59.490 --> 11:01.549
- GORDON MARK HOTEL,
ROOM 418.

11:01.590 --> 11:05.629
WHO'S COMING WITH ME?

11:05.660 --> 11:08.390
- I GUESS WE ARE.
- [blows raspberry]

11:08.430 --> 11:10.159
- MAN.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.623
- YEAH, AND JUST--
JUST FOR THE RECORD,

11:12.670 --> 11:15.594
THIS WOMAN
DOES NOT NEED A PARTNER.

11:15.640 --> 11:18.837
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF SHE NEEDS
A POLICE DEPARTMENT.

11:18.870 --> 11:20.531
ALL RIGHT, GUS,
BEFORE WE GO IN THERE

11:20.580 --> 11:21.831
AND SOLVE OUR LAST CASE EVER--

11:21.880 --> 11:23.438
- WHOA, WHOA, SHAWN, STOP.

11:23.480 --> 11:25.846
LAST CASE?
- UGH.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.075
MAN, I-I THINK
THAT THE WRITING IS ON THE WALL

11:28.120 --> 11:29.747
FOR EVERYTHING
IN OUR LIVES.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.418
- OKAY, OKAY, I THINK I KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

11:32.450 --> 11:34.657
LOOK, SHAWN,
I MAY FINALLY HAVE THE JOB

11:34.690 --> 11:36.385
THAT I DESERVED
SINCE I LEFI' COLLEGE.

11:36.420 --> 11:38.320
I MAY HAVE A SWEET COMPANY CAR

11:38.360 --> 11:40.828
THAT HAS A NAVIGATION UNIT
THAT CAN BE SET TO "TACOS."

11:40.860 --> 11:43.397
BUT KNOW THIS,
I WILL NOT LET THAT

11:43.430 --> 11:45.819
OR ANYTHING ELSE
COME BETWEEN US.

11:45.870 --> 11:48.361
- GOEDECKE, IT'S SBPD!
WE ARE COMING IN.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.265
- THIS CASE IS GONNA
BE OVER IN 30 SECONDS,

11:50.310 --> 11:51.732
AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW
BEFORE IT ENDS,

11:51.770 --> 11:54.409
THE WINDOW'S GONNA CLOSE--
[heavy thud]

11:54.440 --> 11:57.546
[stun grenade explodes]

11:57.580 --> 12:00.378
- AW, CRAP.
- HE'S ALREADY DEAD.

12:00.420 --> 12:04.049
- WAIT A MINUTE, YOU CAN
SET YOUR NAVIGATION TO "TACOS"?

12:20.270 --> 12:23.262
- LOVE.

12:23.310 --> 12:26.268
- THAT'S MY MIDDLE NAME.
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

12:26.310 --> 12:28.699
- PLEASE BE GOOD TO HIM.

12:28.740 --> 12:30.879
- TO WHO?
- MY BEST FRIEND.

12:30.910 --> 12:32.548
AND HE'S GONNA NEED SOMEONE
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

12:32.580 --> 12:34.377
SOMEONE KIND,

12:34.420 --> 12:37.787
SOMEONE UNDERSTANDING,
LIKE YOU.

12:37.820 --> 12:39.708
HE'S FRAGILE, YOU KNOW?

12:39.750 --> 12:41.752
HE HAS NIGHT TERRORS,
AND HE CRIES A LOT,

12:41.790 --> 12:45.385
BUT THAT'S JUST BECAUSE HE HAS
AN EXTRA CHAMBER IN HIS HEART.

12:45.430 --> 12:49.924
I BELIEVE SCIENTISTS CALL IT--
[chokes up]

12:49.970 --> 12:52.029
CALL IT THE COMPASSION CHAMBER.

12:52.070 --> 12:53.560
- OH, MY GOD, ARE YOU OKAY?

12:53.600 --> 12:56.489
- I'M SO SORRY.

12:56.540 --> 12:59.532
SHE'S AMAZING.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.107
MY BEST FRIEND
IS GONNA BE JUST FINE.

13:02.140 --> 13:03.869
- I'M SORRY.
WHO ARE YOU?

13:03.910 --> 13:04.899
- OH, I'M SHAWN.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.542
I'M GUS'S BEST FRIEND.

13:06.580 --> 13:09.413
- NICE.

13:09.450 --> 13:10.542
WHO'S GUS?

13:10.590 --> 13:13.184
- HMM.

13:13.220 --> 13:14.209
HMM.

13:14.260 --> 13:16.478
MAYBE NOT TODAY.

13:16.520 --> 13:19.648
BUT EVENTUALLY.

13:19.690 --> 13:21.453
LOOK AT YOU.

13:21.500 --> 13:22.967
YOU'RE SO HANDSOME.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.888
YOU ARE HANDSOME.
- THANK YOU, MR. RICHMOND.

13:24.930 --> 13:26.795
I'LL GET RIGHT ON IT.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.398
- SO I NEED IT
ON MY DESK BY THE MORNING.

13:28.440 --> 13:29.737
I GOTI'A GET OVER
TO BOSSEIGH HIGH BEFORE DARK.

13:29.770 --> 13:32.034
- OH, WOW, YOU TOO?
- ME WHAT?

13:32.070 --> 13:33.901
- I LIKE TO GO TO BOSSEIGH HIGH
WHEN THE PLACE IS EMPTY.

13:33.940 --> 13:35.601
BEST DAYS OF MY LIFE.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.005
I WALK AROUND
AND GET PERSPECTIVE.

13:37.050 --> 13:40.417
MY TROUBLES MELT AWAY.

13:40.450 --> 13:45.683
- WELL, I FINALLY HAD THE VENUE
FOR THE BAD NEWS, AT LEAST.

13:45.720 --> 13:50.589
SOLVE THE CASE,
MEMORY LANE.

13:50.630 --> 13:53.656
PLUS I AM ALMOST POSITIVE

13:53.700 --> 13:55.793
I STILL HAVE A WHATCHAMACALLIT
BAR IN MY LOCKER.

13:55.830 --> 13:57.422
[Chuckles]

13:57.470 --> 13:58.698
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU LIKE TO GO

13:58.730 --> 13:59.867
DOWN TO A HIGH SCHOOL
AND HANG OUT?

13:59.900 --> 14:01.993
- [Chuckles]

14:02.040 --> 14:03.735
NO, NO, NO.
NOTHING LIKE THAT.

14:03.770 --> 14:05.658
YOU KNOW, I LIKE BEING THERE.

14:05.710 --> 14:07.007
IT CLEARS MY MIND,
LIKE YOU.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.507
- I WAS GOING FOR MY SON.

14:08.540 --> 14:11.043
- YOU HAVE A SON
IN HIGH SCHOOL?

14:11.080 --> 14:12.502
WE'RE THE SAME AGE.
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

14:12.550 --> 14:14.347
- HOW DO YOU NOT
HAVE KIDS, MAN?

14:14.380 --> 14:15.608
CHILDBEARING IS
A VERY LIMITED WINDOW.

14:15.650 --> 14:17.743
- OH, NO.
KIDS ARE A BIG THING.

14:17.790 --> 14:18.848
I JUST WANTED
TO GET THINGS LINED UP.

14:18.890 --> 14:20.915
RETIREMENT PLAN,
TIME-SHARE.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.257
I'M LOOKING AT A HOUSE.

14:22.290 --> 14:23.826
- REALLY?
WHERE?

14:23.860 --> 14:27.193
- DOWNTOWN.
- THAT'S MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

14:27.230 --> 14:28.925
DO YOU GARDEN?
- DO I GARDEN?

14:28.960 --> 14:31.326
DO AGAPANTHUS
HAVE BASAL LEAVES?

14:31.370 --> 14:34.168
- [Chuckles]
GOOD ONE.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.599
WELL, I GOT A REAL ESTATE GUY
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.

14:35.640 --> 14:38.359
- I HAVE AN AGENT.
I HAVE AN AGENT.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.605
- HOW DID I NOT KNOW
ANY OF THAT?

14:40.640 --> 14:42.528
- [laughs]
I GO'I'I'A GO, BUDDY.

14:42.580 --> 14:45.276
TAKE IT EASY, BUD.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.889
- HEY, MAN.
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET GOING.

14:54.920 --> 14:56.922
- I JUST GOT HERE.
- IT'S NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT

14:56.960 --> 14:57.984
FOR US To SCORE A WIN
HERE, GUS.

14:58.030 --> 14:58.985
THIS COULD BE OUR LAST CASE.

14:59.030 --> 15:00.793
- OKAY, GIVE ME TWO HOURS.

15:00.830 --> 15:02.252
- BRANNIGAN'LL HAVE THE MURDERER
ON TRIAL BY THEN.

15:02.300 --> 15:03.858
- OKAY, 90 MINUTES.
- 4 MINUTES.

15:03.900 --> 15:05.527
- ONE HOUR AND 15.
- 4 MINUTES AND 5 SECONDS.

15:05.570 --> 15:07.492
- ONE HOUR.
- FOUR MINUTES.

15:07.540 --> 15:08.939
- YOU CAN'T GO BACKWARDS.
- FINE. 4 MINUTES, 12 SECONDS.

15:08.970 --> 15:11.564
- THAT'S NOT A NEGOTIATION.
45 MINUTES.

15:11.610 --> 15:12.861
- 43 MINUTES, 42 SECONDS.
- DONE.

15:12.910 --> 15:14.104
BUT YOU CLEAN THIS MESS UP.

15:14.140 --> 15:15.801
- I DIDN'T DO THAT.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.603
DO YOU GUYS
HAVE TO-GO CONTAINERS?

15:17.650 --> 15:18.878
HEY,HEY.

15:18.910 --> 15:21.447
DON'T WORRY, BUD.
I GOT IT.

15:30.260 --> 15:31.750
PAPA BEAR.

15:31.790 --> 15:33.155
- CAN'T SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM
TODAY, SHAWN.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.021
- I AM HERE SIMPLY
TO SAY HELLO TO MY MAKER.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.322
- YEAH, WELL,
THEN YOU CAN HELP ME.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.120
I GOT ROPED IN
TO FILLING IN

15:38.170 --> 15:39.592
FOR A CRIMINOLOGY COURSE

15:39.630 --> 15:41.097
AT THE COLLEGE
FOR A STUPID EX-PARTNER

15:41.140 --> 15:43.131
WHO WENT
AND LET HIS LIVER FAIL.

15:43.170 --> 15:44.808
- COME ON, DAD,
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN AFRAID

15:44.840 --> 15:46.831
OF ANYTHING
IN YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

15:46.870 --> 15:48.804
- YEAH, I'M JUST
UNSURE OF THE RULES.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.343
LET ME ASK YOU, HOW MUCH
ARE YOU ALLOWED TO SCREAM, HUH?

15:51.380 --> 15:52.938
- WHY DON'T YOU GO
WITH MEDIUM LOUD

15:52.980 --> 15:55.346
AND KEEP YOUR BELLY BUTTON
COVERED NO MATTER WHAT?

15:55.380 --> 15:56.745
- SOUND ADVICE.

15:56.780 --> 15:58.418
I NEED TO GO.

15:58.450 --> 15:59.917
GOTTA BUY BULLETS.

15:59.950 --> 16:03.124
- DAD, WAIT!

16:03.160 --> 16:05.879
YOU'RE--YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DO NEED SOMETHING.

16:05.930 --> 16:08.922
I HAVE TO DELIVER
SOME PRETTY BAD NEWS,

16:08.960 --> 16:12.726
AND--AND I CAN'T QUITE
FIGURE OUT A WAY IN.

16:12.770 --> 16:13.839
- ARE YOU BREAKING UP
WITH JULIET?

16:13.870 --> 16:15.633
- WHAT?
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

16:15.670 --> 16:20.801
LISTEN, I-I CAN'T
MESS THIS ONE UP.

16:20.840 --> 16:23.070
NOT THIS ONE.
IT'S--IT'S TOO IMPORTANT.

16:23.110 --> 16:24.941
- JUST BE STRAIGHTFORWARD.

16:24.980 --> 16:27.039
IT'S ALWAYS
ABOUT THE STATE OF MIND.

16:27.080 --> 16:29.116
DO YOU KNOW THE DAY YOUR MOTHER
TOLD ME SHE WAS LEAVING

16:29.150 --> 16:31.380
WAS THE DAY I SOLVED
THE JEANNIE CODRON KIDNAPPING?

16:31.420 --> 16:34.082
BEST PROFESSIONAL DAY
OF MY LIFE EVER.

16:34.120 --> 16:37.749
DID IT TAKE THE STING OFF?
I DON'T KNOW.

16:37.790 --> 16:38.984
BUT AT LEAST I KNEW
THAT NOT EVERYTHING

16:39.030 --> 16:40.349
IN MY WORLD WAS WRONG.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.992
- THAT'S GOOD.

16:42.030 --> 16:44.965
THAT'S GOOD, DAD.
I G--YEAH, I GET IT.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.661
EVERY TIME WE SOLVE A CASE,
WE DANCE, RIGHT?

16:46.700 --> 16:48.167
- I DIDN'T SAY TO DANCE,
SHAWN.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.633
- NO, BUT YOU TOLD ME
TO SOLVE THE CASE.

16:49.670 --> 16:52.639
- I ALWAYS TELL YOU
TO SOLVE THE CASE.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.799
I LOVE YOU, KID.

16:58.850 --> 17:00.078
ALL RIGHT.

17:00.120 --> 17:03.988
COME ON, LET GO.
THAT'S GOOD.

17:04.020 --> 17:07.478
- JESUS, DAD, WHY DO YOU
STILL HAVE THAT PICTURE?

17:07.520 --> 17:10.728
THAT GUY SHOT YOU,
POINT-BLANK.

17:10.760 --> 17:13.752
- HAIR.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.028
- I KNOW
IT PROBABLY SEEMS LIKE

17:15.060 --> 17:16.698
I'M JUST JUMPING
FROM IDEA TO IDEA,

17:16.730 --> 17:20.063
BUT THIS ONE TRULY
DOES FEEL LIKE THE BEST.

17:20.100 --> 17:24.161
BUT FIRST, I NEEDED
TO SOLVE THE CASE.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.666
- THERE'S NOTHING
BRANNIGAN MISSED.

17:25.710 --> 17:27.769
- THERE HAS TO BE.
THERE ALWAYS IS.

17:27.810 --> 17:29.698
[inhales sharply]

17:29.740 --> 17:31.742
- NAME: KLAUS GOEDECKE.

17:31.780 --> 17:33.577
SIZE 12 WIDE.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.508
RAPIDLY IMPROVING
RAP SHEET.

17:35.550 --> 17:38.439
RECENTLY MADE
A SIZABLE CASH DEPOSIT.

17:43.160 --> 17:46.049
- STOP THINKING SO HARD.
YOU'RE GONNA POP A BLOOD VESSEL.

17:48.630 --> 17:50.461
- HEY, YOU REMEMBER
THAT GUN CASE

17:50.500 --> 17:51.797
THAT WAS RIGHT OVER THERE
ON THE FLOOR?

17:51.830 --> 17:53.593
- YEAH, IT WAS
A PELICAN PICK AND PLUCK.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.369
- A WHAT?
- A PELICAN PICK AND PLUCK

17:55.400 --> 17:56.992
PISTOL PACK.
- SOMEBODY BROUGHT A PELICAN

17:57.040 --> 17:57.904
PICK AND PLUCK PISTOL PACK
ON A CROSS-COUNTRY TRIP?

17:57.940 --> 17:59.532
- IT'S PLAUSIBLE.

17:59.570 --> 18:01.208
- GUS, WHAT IF
IT WASN'T A CRIMINAL?

18:01.240 --> 18:02.969
WHAT IF HE WAS A HIT MAN?

18:03.010 --> 18:05.706
- SOMEONE MURDERED A HIT MAN
WITHOUT BREAKING IN?

18:05.750 --> 18:08.014
- HE LET 'EM IN.
- IT WAS SOMEONE HE KNEW.

18:08.050 --> 18:09.119
- YES, GUS, YES!

18:09.150 --> 18:13.109
- THIS WASN'T A ROBBERY.

18:13.160 --> 18:17.483
- [singsong] SOMEBODY WAS
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

18:24.070 --> 18:26.789
OH, HELLO.
MY NAME IS THIS.

18:26.830 --> 18:28.593
- A TREASURE MAP.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.299
- WHOEVER CAME HERE
AND KILLED THE HIT MAN

18:29.340 --> 18:31.035
WAS LOOKING FOR THIS.

18:31.070 --> 18:32.765
- WE FOUND THE HOLE ALREADY,
AND IT WAS EMPTY,

18:32.810 --> 18:33.799
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
IT DIDN'T LEAD

18:33.840 --> 18:34.829
TO THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.303
- OKAY.
- WAIT A SECOND.

18:37.350 --> 18:40.376
THE HOLE WE FOUND
WAS SOMEWHERE DIFFERENT.

18:42.220 --> 18:44.040
both: THEY WERE DIGGING
IN THE WRONG PLACE!

18:44.090 --> 18:45.978
- YES!
- WHAT, WHAT, WHAT, WHAT, WHAT!

18:46.020 --> 18:47.180
- NOW PUNCH ME IN THE FACE.

18:47.220 --> 18:48.756
HIT ME.
HIT ME AS HARD AS YOU CAN.

18:48.790 --> 18:50.382
WITH YOUR RIGHT FIST.
- WHAT?

18:50.430 --> 18:52.079
- EVERYTHING YOU GOT.
- I'M NOT DOING THAT, SHAWN.

18:52.130 --> 18:53.597
MAN, YOU GOT PROBLEMS.

18:53.630 --> 18:55.621
- I DESERVE IT.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.260
- MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL
THE COPS.

18:59.300 --> 19:01.939
- ONLY GOOD THINGS HAPPEN
WHEN WE DIG FOR STUFF.

19:01.970 --> 19:03.403
- SHAWN, WE DUG
OUR OWN GRAVE.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.668
- YES, BUT THAT WAS
IN MEXICO.

19:04.710 --> 19:07.975
IT DOESN'T COUNT.

19:08.010 --> 19:10.740
GUS, LOOK.
- WHAT?

19:10.780 --> 19:12.873
- THE SOIL'S BEEN DISTURBED.

19:12.910 --> 19:15.549
- THE MAP SAYS THIS IS IT.

19:15.580 --> 19:17.013
DUDE.
- WHOA.

19:17.050 --> 19:18.881
- WHAT?
- BEFORE WE GET ALL DIRTY,

19:18.920 --> 19:22.356
LET'S JUST TAKE A--LET'S TAKE
A MOMENT TO SAVOR THIS.

19:22.390 --> 19:24.381
- DO YOU WANNA TELL ME WHAT
YOU'VE BEEN AVOIDING SAYING?

19:24.430 --> 19:27.524
YOU CAN TELL ME ANYTHING.

19:30.630 --> 19:33.838
- I SUCK!

19:33.870 --> 19:35.838
YOU KNOW, GUS,
WE REALLY SHOULD DISCUSS

19:35.870 --> 19:37.599
HOW MUCH OF THIS TREASURE
WE'RE GONNA KEEP.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.608
- HALF, MAXIMUM.

19:39.640 --> 19:40.971
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THERE'S A TALISMAN

19:41.010 --> 19:43.444
WITH INVISIBILITY PROPERTIES.
YOUR TURN.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.971
- No, No, I WANT YOU
To BE THE ONE WHO FINDS IT.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.045
- REALLY?

19:47.080 --> 19:48.115
- THIS IS YOUR MOMENT, GUS.

19:48.150 --> 19:50.038
- OKAY.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.583
- AFTER ALL, IT WAS YOU
WHO HAS STEADFASTLY HELD TRUE

19:52.620 --> 19:55.384
TO THE BELIEF THAT SOMEDAY,
WE WOULD, IN FACT,

19:55.420 --> 19:58.628
DISCOVER TREASURE
AND HOARD IT ALL FOR OURSELVES.

19:58.660 --> 20:00.423
I MEAN, IT FEELS LIKE--
LIKE CLOSURE.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.928
[thud]
- DUDE, I HIT SOMETHING.

20:02.960 --> 20:06.726
- CLOSURE THAT REPRESENTS
CHANGING OF THE GUARD, PERHAPS.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.533
- [singsong] IT'S BIG.
- NOT WHO WE ARE AS MEN.

20:08.570 --> 20:10.333
AND CERTAINLY NOT
WHAT OUR FRIENDSHIP MEANS, BUT--

20:10.370 --> 20:12.406
- THIS IS EXCITING!

20:12.440 --> 20:14.101
- I MEAN, YOU COULD ARGUE
THAT THIS IS THE PINNACLE

20:14.140 --> 20:15.334
OF OUR CAREERS, I MEAN,
WE'VE DISCOVERED TREASURE.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.506
HOW ARE WE GONNA TOP THAT?

20:16.540 --> 20:18.178
I DON'T THINK WE CAN, GUS.

20:18.210 --> 20:19.677
I'VE MADE A DECISION--

20:19.710 --> 20:23.009
- [screaming]

20:23.050 --> 20:26.679
IT'S A SKELETON!
[screams]

20:26.720 --> 20:28.415
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT'S NOT A MERMAID?

20:28.460 --> 20:30.849
- [screams]
IT'S NOT A MERMAID!

20:30.890 --> 20:33.051
[screaming]

20:33.090 --> 20:34.091
- [Chuckles]

20:34.130 --> 20:35.893
WHO AM I KIDDING?

20:35.930 --> 20:37.898
OUR HIGH SCHOOL.

20:37.930 --> 20:40.637
MUCH BETTER PLACE
TO GIVE THE SPEECH.

20:44.170 --> 20:46.900
HEY, WOOD.
- HEY, SHAWN.

20:46.940 --> 20:48.202
ARE WE KEEPING
THE POLICE OUT OF THIS?

20:48.240 --> 20:50.174
- JUST FOR A BRIEF MOMENT.

20:50.210 --> 20:52.849
- VICTIM'S NAME
IS CHRIS CHERAMIE.

20:52.880 --> 20:53.972
KILLED BY NINE M&Ms.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.612
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

20:55.650 --> 20:57.117
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
THAT SEEMS LOW.

20:57.150 --> 20:59.880
9-MILLIMETER GUN.
9-MILLIMETER GUN.

20:59.920 --> 21:00.955
YEAH, SPRAYED
BY A HANDFUL OF BULLETS.

21:00.990 --> 21:02.651
- WAS HE KILLED
BY A HIT MAN?

21:02.690 --> 21:04.089
- WELL, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
A REALLY BAD ONE.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.757
THE BULLETS ARE DISTRIBUTED
ALL OVER THE BODY.

21:05.790 --> 21:07.087
AND, YOU KNOW,
A 9-MILLIMETER PISTOL,

21:07.130 --> 21:09.098
IT'S JUST NOT--
IT'S NOT SEXY.

21:09.130 --> 21:12.065
UNLESS GAEL GARCIA BERNAL
IS HOLDING IT.

21:12.100 --> 21:13.795
- MM.

21:13.840 --> 21:14.932
- SHAWN, CHRIS CHERAMIE
WAS A LAND SPECULATOR.

21:14.970 --> 21:16.733
HE CAME TO TOWN
TO BID ON A PROPERTY

21:16.770 --> 21:18.408
AND NEVER MADE IT
TO THE AUCTION.

21:18.440 --> 21:22.103
- GUESS WHO WON THE AUCTION.

21:22.140 --> 21:25.576
WARREN DERN.
- AND HIS PARTNER IAN COLLINS.

21:25.610 --> 21:28.613
- BOOM!
- WHAT?

21:28.650 --> 21:29.912
WHOO, WHOO, WHOO.
- WHOO!

21:29.950 --> 21:31.941
THAT'S RIGHT.

21:31.990 --> 21:35.050
SAME BASTARD WHO RUINED MY FIRST
CHANCE OF BREAKING THE NEWS

21:35.090 --> 21:39.527
WITH HIS
"DEDICATED FRIEND" ROUTINE.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.721
- WHOO, WHOO, WHOO, WHOO!
- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?

21:41.760 --> 21:43.318
- * 'CAUSE WE KNOW
WHO THE KILLER IS *

21:43.370 --> 21:44.667
* IT'S IAN COLLINS

21:44.700 --> 21:46.327
* IT'S, IT'S IAN COLLINS

21:46.370 --> 21:48.133
- THAT'S RIGHT,
WE WERE PARTNERS,

21:48.170 --> 21:49.364
AND THEN HE LEFT THIS YEAR.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.903
AND I THOUGHT
THAT WAS A SURPRISE.

21:51.940 --> 21:53.805
- BUT WARREN WANTED OUT,

21:53.840 --> 21:56.479
AND HIS BEST "FRIEND," IAN,
DIDN'T LIKE THAT.

21:56.510 --> 21:58.205
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, GUS.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.969
SO QUICK TO JUDGE.
BREAKUPS ARE HARD, GUS.

22:01.020 --> 22:04.046
SOMETIMES, CIRCUMSTANCES DICT ATE
MORE THAN PERSONAL CHOICE.

22:04.090 --> 22:05.216
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, SHAWN?

22:05.250 --> 22:06.842
WOODY,
CAN YOU GIVE US AN HOUR

22:06.890 --> 22:07.959
BEFORE YOU LET ANYONE
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

22:07.990 --> 22:09.753
- PERFECT.
I NEEDED SOME TIME

22:09.790 --> 22:11.985
TO SNEAK OUT THE FLAXEN-HAIRED
HIT MAN'S JACKET.

22:12.030 --> 22:13.520
- YOU WANT THE CLOTHES
HE WAS KILLED IN?

22:13.560 --> 22:16.859
- TWO THINGS: I DON'T HAVE
ANY HIT-MAN CLOTHES.

22:16.900 --> 22:19.460
AND THIS JACKET ACCENTUATES
BOTH MY SPRING FEATURES

22:19.500 --> 22:20.592
AND MY THIRD SHOULDER BLADE.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.232
I JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE

22:22.270 --> 22:24.363
THAT I CAN DRY-CLEAN OUT
THE STAIN ON THE SLEEVE.

22:24.410 --> 22:27.061
I HAVE IDENTIFIED IT
AS, UH, BRAKE DUST

22:27.110 --> 22:30.329
OR A REALLY STALE
PIXY STICK.

22:30.380 --> 22:32.803
EASY.
THAT'S TECH NICALLY MINE.

22:36.350 --> 22:38.443
- WAS HIS CAR IMPOUNDED?

22:44.760 --> 22:47.729
HOLY...

22:50.400 --> 22:53.267
- AND A 9-MILLIMETER PISTOL,
IT--IT'S NOT SEXY.

22:53.300 --> 22:57.361
UNLESS GAEL GARCIA BERNAL'S
HOLDING IT.

22:57.410 --> 22:58.763
- GUS,
WE HAVE THE MURDER WEAPON.

22:58.810 --> 23:00.129
- WE SOLVED IT.
- IT'S OVER.

23:00.170 --> 23:01.501
WE'RE WINNERS.
WE'VE WON.

23:01.540 --> 23:02.905
- LET'S GET THIS TO LASSIE,

23:02.940 --> 23:05.044
SO I CAN GET BACK
FOR MY 3:00.

23:05.080 --> 23:07.344
- OR...
- OR WHAT?

23:07.380 --> 23:09.314
ALL RIGHT, SHAWN.

23:09.350 --> 23:10.544
YOU WANNA TELL ME WHY
WE'RE AT OUR OLD HIGH SCHOOL?

23:10.590 --> 23:12.410
- BECAUSE IT'S AWESOME, GUS.

23:12.450 --> 23:14.088
BECAUSE IT'S YOUR HAPPY PLACE.

23:14.120 --> 23:15.849
AND OUR FRIENDSHIP

23:15.890 --> 23:17.448
IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT
THING IN MY LIFE.

23:17.490 --> 23:19.879
GOT ME
THROUGH MY PARENTS' DIVORCE.

23:19.930 --> 23:22.455
HOLY CRAP, THAT'S THE CAR
WE LEARNED TO DRIVE ON.

23:22.500 --> 23:25.890
- THAT'S THE CAR YOU STOLE.
- ONCE, FOR A DATE.

23:25.930 --> 23:28.467
AH, INDELIBLE MEMORIES,
UNABLE TO BE TAINTED.

23:28.500 --> 23:29.990
- YOU CAN PROBABLY
TAINT THOSE.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.302
- [laughs] ANYWAY,

23:31.340 --> 23:32.466
TWO STEERING WHEELS,
DUAL BRAKES.

23:32.510 --> 23:34.205
MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE
TO MAKE OUT

23:34.240 --> 23:35.434
IN THE FRONT SEAT,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

23:35.480 --> 23:37.209
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, SHAWN?

23:37.240 --> 23:40.175
YOU'VE BEEN ACTING CRAZY
THIS ENTIRE INVESTIGATION.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.768
- WELL, THERE'S
A REASON FOR THAT.

23:41.820 --> 23:43.242
THIS IS OUR LAST CASE
TOGETHER.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.145
- WHAT? WHY?

23:45.190 --> 23:47.909
- PROBABLY BECAUSE I'M GONNA
HAVE TO SHOOT YOU BOTH.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.916
- [smacks lips]

23:54.200 --> 23:55.599
- I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING
YOU TWO ALL DAY.

23:55.630 --> 23:57.291
WHO FINDS A MURDER WEAPON

23:57.330 --> 23:58.991
AND GOES
TO A WENDY'S DRIVE-THROUGH?

23:59.030 --> 24:00.395
- HUNGRY PEOPLE.

24:00.430 --> 24:01.761
PEOPLE WHO APPRECIATE VALUE
AND QUALITY

24:01.800 --> 24:03.267
AND DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME.

24:03.300 --> 24:04.631
- BESIDES,
WE HAD MEXICAN YESTERDAY,

24:04.670 --> 24:07.138
SO DEL TACO WAS OUT.
- YOU WENT TO DEL TACO.

24:07.170 --> 24:08.831
- FOR DESSERT.
- WHERE'S THE GUN?

24:08.880 --> 24:10.074
- DON'T HAVE IT.
- IT'S IN THE CAR.

24:10.110 --> 24:11.372
- I ALREADY SEARCHED THE CAR.
- WHAT?

24:11.410 --> 24:12.502
YOU DIDN'T BREAK THE WINDOW,
DID YOU?

24:12.550 --> 24:14.108
THAT'S A CUSTOM TINT.

24:14.150 --> 24:15.378
- AND I CUT
THE IGNITION THERE, LENO,

24:15.420 --> 24:16.876
SO DON'T THINK
ABOUT RUNNING OFF.

24:16.920 --> 24:18.410
- I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
THAT I CANNOT

24:18.450 --> 24:20.213
MAKE A DAMAGE CLAIM
THIS EARLY INTO MY NEW JOB.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.581
- YOU TELL ME
WHERE THE GUN IS,

24:21.620 --> 24:23.349
I'LL LET YOU LIVE
ANOTHER 30 SECONDS.

24:23.390 --> 24:24.550
- COME ON, MAN, YOU
DON'T WANNA KEEP KILLING DUDEs.

24:24.590 --> 24:26.319
- YEAH, I DO.

24:26.360 --> 24:27.588
IT GETS EASIER.

24:27.630 --> 24:28.619
- DOES IT REALLY?

24:28.660 --> 24:30.252
LET'S--LET'S CHART

24:30.300 --> 24:31.597
YOUR PROGRESS AS A MURDERER,
SHALL WE?

24:31.630 --> 24:34.337
THREE YEARS AGO,
YOU AND YOUR BEST BUD KILLED

24:34.370 --> 24:36.235
CHRIS CHERAMIE,
YOUR RIVAL IN A LAND DEAL.

24:36.270 --> 24:40.434
[gunshot]
- [grunts]

24:40.470 --> 24:43.507
- AND YOU ALL BURIED
HIS BODY IN THE WOODS.

24:43.550 --> 24:46.178
- NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT HAP--
I BURIED THE BODY,

24:46.210 --> 24:49.714
HE BURIED THE GUN.

24:49.750 --> 24:52.310
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HE
WAS GONNA USE IT FOR LEVERAGE.

24:52.350 --> 24:53.612
SEE, YOU CAN'T
TRUST YOUR FRIENDS.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.150
- DON'T TRY
AND MAKE THIS ABOUT ME.

24:55.190 --> 24:56.612
- WOULD YOU GIVE ME THE GUN?
- HOLD ON.

24:56.660 --> 24:57.649
I WANNA MAKE SURE
I HAVE THIS STRAIGHT.

24:57.690 --> 24:59.385
YOUR PARTNER SPLITS,

24:59.430 --> 25:01.227
YOU HIRE A HIT MAN
TO KILL HIM

25:01.260 --> 25:03.569
WHILE YOU HAVE THE PERFECT ALIBI
OF BEING AT A FUNDRAISER.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.592
BUT YOUR BOY
HAS ONE MORE CARD TO PLAY.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.359
- I GOT A MURDER WEAPON
WITH HIS FINGERPRINTS.

25:08.400 --> 25:10.061
WE CAN BLACKMAIL HIM.

25:10.100 --> 25:12.261
PUT THE GUN DOWN.
I CAN TAKE YOU TO THE GUN.

25:12.310 --> 25:14.130
- BECAUSE HE AND THE HIT MAN
GO TO THE GUN AND REALIZE,

25:14.180 --> 25:15.408
I'WAIT A SECOND.

25:15.440 --> 25:16.737
"WE SHOULD BE BLACKMAILING
THE DUDE

25:16.780 --> 25:19.146
WHOSE PRINTS
ARE ACTUALLY ON THE WEAPON."

25:19.180 --> 25:22.672
[silenced gunshot]
- [grunts]

25:22.720 --> 25:25.143
- AND WHEN YOU GIVE ME
THE WEAPON, THE TRAIL ENDS.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.112
SO HOW ARE WE
GONNA PLAY THIS?

25:27.150 --> 25:29.357
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

25:29.390 --> 25:31.324
THERE'S SOMETHING
I DESPERATELY NEED TO ADMIT

25:31.360 --> 25:33.453
TO MY BEST FRIEND
BEFORE YOU BLOW US AWAY.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.094
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?
- NOT REALLY.

25:35.130 --> 25:36.222
- GUS, LISTEN.

25:36.260 --> 25:39.093
I STOLE A WHOLE BUNCH

25:39.130 --> 25:42.065
OF THIS SPICED FLAXSEED
FROM YOUR OFFICE KITCHEN.

25:42.100 --> 25:44.364
- WHAT?
- IT'S DELICIOUS.

25:44.410 --> 25:46.560
I CAN'T STOP
PUTTING IT IN MY MOUTH.

25:46.610 --> 25:47.599
I'M ASHAMED.

25:47.640 --> 25:51.349
I'M SORRY.

25:51.380 --> 25:53.007
- ALL RIGHT,
YOUR CONSCIENCE CLEAR?

25:53.050 --> 25:54.745
- YES.
NOW IT IS.

25:54.780 --> 25:56.873
THANK YOU FOR THAT.
- SURE.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.012
[grunts]

25:58.050 --> 26:01.213
- GO, GUS! RUN!

26:01.260 --> 26:02.784
DID YOU SEE THAT, GUS?

26:02.820 --> 26:04.219
HE FELL FOR THE OLD
"FLAXSEED IN THE EYE" BIT.

26:04.260 --> 26:05.557
- SHAWN, WE NEED
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

26:05.590 --> 26:09.219
- THEN WE'LL GO
THROUGH THE CAFETERIA.

26:09.260 --> 26:10.591
- THE DOOR'S LOCKED.
- SO IS MINE!

26:10.630 --> 26:12.268
KEEP GOING!

26:15.670 --> 26:18.002
[both panting]

26:18.040 --> 26:19.701
GUS, LOOK, OUR LOCKERS.
- SHAWN!

26:19.740 --> 26:21.105
- YOU CAN'T
LET THESE MOMENTS PASS.

26:21.140 --> 26:22.300
- UPSTAIRS!
- OKAY.

26:31.190 --> 26:32.817
GUS, WE'RE TRAPPED.
ALL THESE DOORS ARE LOCKED.

26:32.850 --> 26:34.681
- SHAWN, YOU KNOW
THAT IT'S SCHOOL POLICY

26:34.720 --> 26:36.585
THAT AFTER 5:00 P.M.,
ALL DOORS TO THE SCHOOL--

26:36.620 --> 26:39.180
OH, MY GOSH!

26:39.230 --> 26:41.619
IT'S HIM!

26:41.660 --> 26:45.369
- GUS, I HAVE AN IDEA.

26:53.310 --> 26:55.631
AW, SWEET. GOT IT.
- SHAWN, START THE CAR.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.706
[engine starts]

26:58.750 --> 27:00.672
[tires screech]

27:00.720 --> 27:02.312
LET ME DRIVE.
- WHY WOULD I LET YOU DRIVE?

27:02.350 --> 27:04.318
YOU'RE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.

27:04.350 --> 27:06.614
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
[screams]

27:06.650 --> 27:08.356
LOOK OUT!
- [grunts]

27:08.390 --> 27:10.688
- YOU KNOW I HAVE
BETTER ELUDING SKILLS, SHAWN.

27:10.730 --> 27:11.754
NOW PUNCH IT.
I GOT THE BRAKE.

27:11.790 --> 27:13.587
- WE BOTH HAVE BRAKES.

27:13.630 --> 27:14.824
[gunshots]
- LET GO OF YOUR WHEEL, SHAWN.

27:14.860 --> 27:18.091
- YOU LET GO OF YOUR FACE.

27:18.130 --> 27:20.269
[tires screech]

27:34.250 --> 27:36.218
- LET GO OF YOUR WHEEL,
SHAWN!

27:40.350 --> 27:42.818
- HE'S COMING RIGHT AT US!
- OH, MY GOD!

27:44.090 --> 27:45.955
HOW'D HE GET HIS CAR SO FAST?

27:45.990 --> 27:47.355
- BECAUSE HE'S SMOOTH
AND EUROPEAN

27:47.390 --> 27:49.995
AND HIS 'STACHE
IS IMMACULATELY GROOMED.

27:51.730 --> 27:53.391
- STOP THINKING HE'S COOL,

27:53.430 --> 27:54.658
AND TELL ME WHAT
THIS IS ALL ABOUT, SHAWN.

27:54.700 --> 27:55.837
WHY ARE WE HERE?
- I CAN'T.

27:55.870 --> 27:57.292
NOW'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME.

27:57.340 --> 27:59.069
- YES, IT IS!
[tires screech]

27:59.110 --> 28:00.429
- [screams]

28:08.350 --> 28:10.443
HERE'S THE BIG SURPRISE.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.289
THAT CAR CAN MOVE.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.618
WAIT A MINUTE.

28:14.660 --> 28:16.355
WHERE'S THAT ROAD END?
- AT THE COLLEGE.

28:16.390 --> 28:17.755
- ALL RIGHT.
TAKE THE WHEEL.

28:17.790 --> 28:19.553
- I HAVE THE WHEEL!

28:19.590 --> 28:21.251
[tires screech]

28:25.670 --> 28:28.764
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:31.370 --> 28:34.931
[phone vibrating]

28:41.450 --> 28:43.441
- I GUESS WE'LL WAIT
TILL EVERYBODY'S HERE

28:43.480 --> 28:44.913
TO DO ROLL CALL.

28:44.950 --> 28:47.817
- THIS IS IT.
- THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.418
- CLASS IS SUPPOSED
TO BE ONLINE, SO...

28:49.460 --> 28:51.985
NONE OF US
ARE HAPPY ABOUT IT.

28:57.560 --> 28:59.425
- WHY ARE YOU TEXTING?

28:59.470 --> 29:01.199
- WILL YOU
JUST WORK WITH ME HERE?

29:01.240 --> 29:02.798
WHOA!
DRIVE FASTER.

29:02.840 --> 29:04.364
- THIS CAR
IS 20 YEARS OLD, SHAWN.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.937
- STAY ON THE ROAD.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.039
- I'M JUST SAYING, I DON'T
THINK YOU CAN LEARN ANYTHING

29:10.080 --> 29:11.638
ABOUT POLICE WORK ONLINE.

29:11.680 --> 29:14.410
- THEN WHY
DO I HAVE ALL "A"s?

29:18.320 --> 29:19.446
[gunshots]

29:19.490 --> 29:22.357
- [ye|P5]

29:22.390 --> 29:24.187
- TELL YOU WHAT.

29:24.230 --> 29:25.925
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW US
WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED?

29:25.960 --> 29:27.621
- WE DON'T DO QUIZZES.

29:27.660 --> 29:28.957
- OF COURSE YOU DON'T.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.888
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
- WHAT?

29:30.930 --> 29:32.522
- YOU HEARD ME. CLOSE YOUR EYES.
- YOU'RE SERIOUS.

29:32.570 --> 29:36.233
- YOU'RE FAILING ALREADY.

29:36.270 --> 29:38.738
HOW MANY HATS ARE IN THE ROOM?
- HOW MANY WHAT?

29:38.770 --> 29:39.839
- YOU KNOW, I'M STARTING TO
THINK YOUR PROBLEM IS HEARING.

29:39.870 --> 29:43.033
HOW MANY HATS
ARE IN THE ROOM?

29:43.080 --> 29:46.004
HOW MANY ROWS OF SEATS?
WHAT COLOR SHIRT AM I WEARING?

29:46.050 --> 29:49.611
I'LL TAKE AN ANSWER
TO ANY ONE OF THESE QUESTIONS.

29:49.650 --> 29:51.789
[phone beeps]

30:01.560 --> 30:03.425
FIELD TRIP.

30:03.460 --> 30:04.927
- WE'RE COMING UP ON THE END
OF THE ROAD, SHAWN.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.062
- CAN WE MAKE A U-TURN?

30:06.100 --> 30:09.297
- WE'RE ALSO RUNNING OUT OF GAS.

30:09.340 --> 30:10.568
- ALL RIGHT, GUS,
IF THIs Is IT,

30:10.600 --> 30:11.635
I REALLY NEED YOU
TO KNOW SOMETHING.

30:11.670 --> 30:13.467
- I KNOW, SHAWN.
- YOU DO?

30:13.510 --> 30:15.034
- YEs, I Do.
YOU LOVE ME.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.308
YOU LOVE ME IN A WAY
THAT MEN CAN LOVE EACH OTHER

30:16.340 --> 30:17.602
AND STILL HAVE WIVES

30:17.640 --> 30:19.369
AND CHILDREN
AND CONNECTING POOLS.

30:19.410 --> 30:20.877
- YES, BUT MAYBE THE POOLS THING
ISN'T GONNA WORK.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.547
- IT DOESN'T MATTER, SHAWN.

30:22.580 --> 30:23.774
- YEs, IT DOES,
BECAUSE IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

30:23.820 --> 30:25.242
- SHAWN, I NEED TO HIT
THE BRAKES.

30:25.290 --> 30:27.508
[tires screech]

30:29.390 --> 30:31.278
[gunshots]

30:31.330 --> 30:32.957
[tire pops]

30:36.400 --> 30:38.322
- DAD!

30:46.570 --> 30:47.730
- No, No.

30:47.770 --> 30:50.978
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

30:51.010 --> 30:55.379
- [panting]
HE FINALLY CALLED ME.

30:57.850 --> 31:00.580
- BEST CLASS EVER.

31:00.620 --> 31:02.656
- [laughs]

31:02.690 --> 31:06.387
[distant sirens blare]

31:06.430 --> 31:09.991
- SO WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

31:10.030 --> 31:14.433
- LOOK, GUS, THE TRUTH IS--

31:14.470 --> 31:16.028
LOOK AT MY DAD.

31:16.070 --> 31:17.162
HE'S TOTALLY MATT DAMON-ING
IT UP OVER THERE.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.599
- WHAT?

31:18.640 --> 31:19.607
- HE'S LIKE BRUCE WILLIS
IN COP OUT.

31:19.640 --> 31:20.561
- WILL YOU JUST SAY IT, SHAWN?

31:20.610 --> 31:21.634
- CHIKLIS IN WIRED.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.874
- AS BELUSHI?
- SURE.

31:22.910 --> 31:25.299
- NO.
- "BREAKING DAD."

31:25.350 --> 31:27.978
[light applause]

31:35.220 --> 31:40.920
- AND SO I ACCEPT
THAT THIS IS MY FATAL FLAW.

31:40.960 --> 31:43.895
I JUST CAN'T QUITE...

31:43.930 --> 31:47.934
ENGAGE ALL THE WAY
WHEN I REALLY NEED TO.

31:47.970 --> 31:49.528
WHEN IT REALLY MATTERS,
YOU KNOW?

31:49.570 --> 31:50.730
WHEN THE CHIPS ARE DOWN.

31:50.770 --> 31:54.399
SO...
I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING

31:54.440 --> 31:56.908
IS THAT I'M SORRY, GUS.

31:56.940 --> 32:01.218
I'M SORRY
THAT I CAN'T DO GOOD-BYES.

32:04.050 --> 32:06.689
I TRIED SO HARD
TO TELL YOU, MAN.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.958
AT THE REAL STUFF.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.627
YOU KNOW THAT.

32:15.660 --> 32:19.960
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.037
YOU'RE GONNA
BE BETTER THAN FINE.

32:24.970 --> 32:27.973
I JUST CAN'T HELP
THINKING THAT...

32:28.010 --> 32:29.568
THE ONLY PROBLEM

32:29.610 --> 32:32.170
THAT YOU REALLY HAD
THIS WHOLE TIME...

32:35.450 --> 32:39.238
IS ME.

32:39.290 --> 32:41.611
AND I'VE KEPT YOU FROM THE LIFE
THAT YOU DESERVE, YOU KNOW?

32:41.660 --> 32:43.059
THE LIFE THAT YOU'VE EARNED.

32:43.090 --> 32:44.955
THE LIFE THAT YOU'D HAVE

32:44.990 --> 32:46.958
IF I HADN'T BARGED
INTO YOUR OFFICE EIGHT YEARS AGO

32:46.990 --> 32:51.165
AND SAID,
"WE'RE GONNA PLAY DETECTIVE...

32:51.200 --> 32:54.260
WHETHER YOU WANT TO OR NOT."

32:56.370 --> 32:58.304
[sniffles]

33:02.740 --> 33:05.675
I LOVE YOU, MAN.

33:19.460 --> 33:20.381
[door closes]

33:20.430 --> 33:22.352
- SHAWN?

33:27.830 --> 33:29.331
[clatter]
SHAWN?

33:31.510 --> 33:32.932
- HE DIDN'T
TELL YOU EITHER, HUH?

33:32.970 --> 33:34.699
- DVD.

33:34.740 --> 33:38.141
- YEAH, I GUESS
HE SENT ONE TO EVERYBODY.

33:38.180 --> 33:42.014
- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH THIS PLACE?

33:42.050 --> 33:45.611
- I'M SURE SOMEBODY'LL
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

33:45.650 --> 33:47.242
SEE YA AROUND.

34:18.420 --> 34:20.183
- WOODROW...

34:20.220 --> 34:23.087
I'LL MISS YOU MOST OF ALL.

34:23.120 --> 34:26.556
STAY GOLD, PONY WOOD.

34:26.590 --> 34:27.921
STAY GOLD.

34:27.960 --> 34:31.828
- YOU KNOW I WILL, SHAWN.

34:31.870 --> 34:34.168
SHAWN? SHAWN?

34:34.200 --> 34:38.102
THIS IS THE WEIRDEST SKYPE CALL
I'VE EVER BEEN ON.

34:38.140 --> 34:41.439
- DETECTIVE DOBSON...

34:41.480 --> 34:42.833
WHAT CAN I SAY?

34:42.880 --> 34:45.098
WE DIDN'T GET TO SPEAK
NEARLY AS MUCH

34:45.150 --> 34:48.745
AS I EVER WOULD HAVE LIKED,
BUT I HEARD MORE ABOUT YOU

34:48.780 --> 34:51.749
THAN ANYONE EVER COULD.

34:51.790 --> 34:54.918
AND YOU SOUND HEROIC.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.849
THE KIND OF GUY THAT I
COULD HAVE WORSHIPPED AS A CHILD

34:57.890 --> 35:00.256
AND AN ADOLESCENT.

35:00.290 --> 35:02.155
WELL INTO MY 20$.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.418
- DOBSON.

35:04.470 --> 35:05.926
BRANNIGAN'S MAKING
THESE DAMN BRACELETS AGAIN.

35:05.970 --> 35:07.528
YOU GOTTA TAKE THIS ONE.

35:07.570 --> 35:10.334
I CLOGGED THE DRAIN
WITH THE LAST BATCH.

35:14.240 --> 35:17.505
WHAT'S THIS?
- I DON'T KNOW.

35:17.540 --> 35:19.098
GUY HASN'T SAID ONE WORD TO ME
IN EIGHT YEARS,

35:19.150 --> 35:22.540
AND THEN HE SENDS ME
A GOOD-BYE VIDEO.

35:22.580 --> 35:23.808
IT'S REALLY WEIRD.

35:23.850 --> 35:25.681
- NOT REALLY.

35:30.020 --> 35:33.148
- CARLTON LASSITER.
CHIEF LASSIE.

35:33.190 --> 35:36.853
THE LORD OF STERNBUSH.

35:36.900 --> 35:41.769
I AM PROUD, HONORED, AND...

35:41.800 --> 35:44.667
BAFFLED TO CALL YOU
MY FRIEND.

35:44.710 --> 35:48.134
BUT IT'S TRUE.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.670
IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT YOU MIGHT

35:49.710 --> 35:52.645
BE THE ONLY OTHER PERSON
ON THE PLANET

35:52.680 --> 35:55.376
WHO LOVES JULES
AS MUCH AS I DO.

35:55.420 --> 35:58.981
EVEN THOUGH IT'S DIFFERENT.

35:59.020 --> 36:01.955
YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD HER BACK,
AND FOR THAT, I FEEL I OWE YOU

36:01.990 --> 36:05.858
MORE THAN THE OTHERS, SO...

36:05.890 --> 36:09.496
TIME TO COME CLEAN.

36:09.530 --> 36:14.092
REGARDING MY METHODS
AND THE WAY THAT I SOLVE CASES,

36:14.130 --> 36:19.534
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE THAT'S
EVER SUSPECTED THAT, UH...

36:19.570 --> 36:22.869
[Chuckles]

36:22.910 --> 36:26.243
THE TRUTH IS,
I AM NOT--

36:32.590 --> 36:35.559
[crack]

36:35.590 --> 36:37.581
- CHIEF?
- YEP.

36:37.620 --> 36:39.827
- OKAY, CHIEF.

36:39.860 --> 36:42.055
SO I'VE BEEN DOING
A LOT OF SOUL SEARCHING,

36:42.100 --> 36:46.161
AND EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE
TECHNICALLY MAKING ME DO THIS,

36:46.200 --> 36:49.237
I'VE CHOSEN
A JUNIOR DETECTIVE.

36:51.840 --> 36:53.967
- THIS IS FAR AND AWAY
THE LOWEST SCORE

36:54.010 --> 36:55.830
I'VE EVER SEEN
ON A DETECTIVE'S EXAM.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.007
- YES.
- NO.

36:58.040 --> 37:00.304
- IT'S THE PERFECT PROJECT.
A MOLDABLE PIECE OF CLAY.

37:00.350 --> 37:02.341
- THIS HARDLY
QUALIFIES AS CLAY.

37:02.380 --> 37:05.281
- I CAN BUILD HIM
FROM THE GROUND UP.

37:05.320 --> 37:07.538
I CAN TURN HIM INTO YOU.

37:10.060 --> 37:13.427
- I SUPPOSE STRANGER THINGS
HAVE HAPPENED.

37:14.900 --> 37:19.189
- DID HE SAY YES?

37:19.230 --> 37:21.266
- CONGRATULATIONS,
JUNIOR DETECTIVE.

37:21.300 --> 37:22.938
- THANK YOU, SIR.

37:22.970 --> 37:24.733
- TIGHTEN YOUR TIE.

37:24.770 --> 37:26.328
- YEs, SIR.

37:26.370 --> 37:27.906
- ALL RIGHT, GET OUT OF HERE.

37:27.940 --> 37:30.670
I GOT A LOT
OF BUSY IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO.

37:30.710 --> 37:32.940
- THANK YOU, SIR.

37:41.690 --> 37:43.612
- HEY.

37:45.060 --> 37:48.723
PUT THE BABY ON.

37:48.760 --> 37:50.796
HELLO, LILLY.

37:50.830 --> 37:52.969
THIS IS YOUR DADDY.

38:03.340 --> 38:05.479
- JULES.

38:06.350 --> 38:07.772
I'M HERE.

38:07.810 --> 38:10.017
- SHAWN.

38:10.050 --> 38:13.542
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

38:13.590 --> 38:16.115
- LOOK, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH
DISPATCHER MADE ME PROMISE

38:16.160 --> 38:17.650
NOT TELL YOU THAT SHE GAVE UP
THE CRIME SCENE

38:17.690 --> 38:19.226
YOU WERE WORKING AT--
LORETTA--

38:19.260 --> 38:21.899
WHAT MATTERS IS THAT
OUR LIFE TOGETHER STARTS NOW.

38:21.930 --> 38:23.192
AND IF WE
DON'T GET BUSY LIVING IT,

38:23.230 --> 38:25.790
IT IS GONNA PASS US BY.

38:25.830 --> 38:27.195
- MR. SPENCER.

38:27.230 --> 38:29.266
- CHIEF.
WELCOME.

38:30.670 --> 38:34.162
- YOU'RE STANDING ON EVIDENCE.

38:34.210 --> 38:35.575
THIS IS SAN FRANCISCO.

38:35.610 --> 38:36.975
IT'S A LITTLE MORE STRUCTURED,

38:37.010 --> 38:38.238
PERHAPS,
THAN YOU'RE USED TO.

38:38.280 --> 38:40.942
- OH!
- OH, SURE. WHY NOT?

38:40.980 --> 38:42.208
- YOU LEAVE ME WITHOUT
SO MUCH AS SAYING GOOD-BYE,

38:42.250 --> 38:43.478
AND THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE OKAY?

38:43.520 --> 38:44.987
- [gaSPSI
YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM?

38:45.020 --> 38:47.318
- NO, NO, I--
I LEFT HIM A MESSAGE.

38:47.350 --> 38:48.351
- YOU MIGHT AS WELL
HAVE JUST SENT ME

38:48.390 --> 38:49.948
A TEXT SAYING, "I'M OUT."

38:49.990 --> 38:52.254
- NO, NO, NO, GUYS.
IT WAS A VIDEO MESSAGE.

38:52.290 --> 38:54.497
I SPENT SEVERAL HOURS FINISHING
IT, IT WAS FULL OF DETAIL

38:54.530 --> 38:56.452
THAT MADE IT
EVEN MORE PERSONAL

38:56.500 --> 39:00.163
THAN AN ACTUAL CONVERSATION,
AND HOLY CRAP, MAN!

39:00.200 --> 39:04.296
WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

39:04.340 --> 39:06.535
- WELL...

39:06.570 --> 39:09.004
I WAS ABOUT TO MAKE
MY FIRST PRESENTATION, RIGHT?

39:09.040 --> 39:10.701
- OKAY.

39:10.740 --> 39:12.298
- ALL RIGHT, CONFERENCE ROOM,
TWO MINUTES.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.999
- BE RIGHT THERE.
I AM READY.

39:14.050 --> 39:17.645
I JUST HAVE TO PICK UP
MY PRESENTATION.

39:24.930 --> 39:27.319
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
TODAY'S PRESENTATION

39:27.360 --> 39:30.193
WILL BE HANDLED
BY OUR NEWEST TEAM MEMBER,

39:30.230 --> 39:32.369
MR. BURT GUSTER,
A MAN THAT I PERSONALLY SAVED

39:32.400 --> 39:35.437
FROM A LIFETIME
OF UNDERACHIEVEMENT.

39:39.240 --> 39:41.708
- I'M SORRY.

39:41.740 --> 39:43.708
- BURT.

39:43.740 --> 39:45.276
BURT!

39:45.310 --> 39:47.346
- WHAT ABOUT THE HOUSE
THAT YOU WANNA BUY,

39:47.380 --> 39:49.109
THE REAL ESTATE AGENT
YOU HAVE

39:49.150 --> 39:50.515
THAT I NEVER
HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT,

39:50.550 --> 39:52.211
AND--AND ALL THE CHILDREN

39:52.250 --> 39:54.081
THAT YOU'RE READY
TO START PUSHING OUT?

39:54.120 --> 39:57.180
- SHAWN, CHILDREN TERRIFY ME.

39:57.220 --> 39:58.949
I'M SURE THEY WON'T,
AT SOME POINT,

39:58.990 --> 40:00.127
BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME
TO HAVE THEM

40:00.160 --> 40:01.457
WHEN YOU'RE 60, RIGHT?

40:01.500 --> 40:03.252
- YEs,
BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE, GUS.

40:03.300 --> 40:04.961
I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.365
I WAS HIDING AND HOARDING
THE SODA MACHINE.

40:06.400 --> 40:07.867
I DRANK STRAIGHT FROM THE TAP
LIKE AN ANIMAL.

40:07.900 --> 40:09.299
LIKE AN ANIMAL!

40:09.340 --> 40:10.432
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
I'M PROUD OF,

40:10.470 --> 40:12.335
BUT I HEARD EVERY WORD.

40:12.370 --> 40:15.305
- SHAWN, I WAS LYING.
I WAS SO LYING.

40:15.340 --> 40:18.138
I LOOKED AT ALL THOSE FACES,
AND THEN I REALIZED

40:18.180 --> 40:21.047
I HAVE THE SAME JOB.

40:21.080 --> 40:23.969
YES, I HAVE A BETTER OFFICE,
A HOTTER SECRETARY,

40:24.020 --> 40:26.784
A SODA MACHINE,
BUT IT'S THE SAME JOB,

40:26.820 --> 40:29.459
AND I CANNOT BE
THAT MAN, SHAWN.

40:29.490 --> 40:32.152
I AM AN ADVENTURER NOW,
WITH A FRIENDSHIP FOR THE AGES.

40:32.190 --> 40:33.851
AND IF I HAVE TO LIVE
IN ANOTHER CITY

40:33.890 --> 40:35.824
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN,
THEN SO BE IT.

40:35.860 --> 40:39.125
THAT'S THE WAY
IT'S GOTTA BE.

40:39.170 --> 40:40.865
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE
SECOND THOUGHTS AT ALL?

40:40.900 --> 40:42.629
- NOPE.
NEVER.

40:42.670 --> 40:45.138
WHAT?
WHAT?

40:45.170 --> 40:46.569
WHAT?

40:46.610 --> 40:47.907
WHAT AM I DOING?

40:47.940 --> 40:50.579
[tires screech]

40:53.280 --> 40:54.941
- ACCORDING TO THE FIGURES, IT
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO--

40:54.980 --> 40:58.313
- I AM SO, SO SORRY.

40:58.350 --> 41:02.059
MY CLOSEST FRIEND
JUST MOVED AWAY, AND...

41:02.090 --> 41:04.888
I'M EXPERIENCING
MIXED EMOTIONS AND...

41:08.830 --> 41:09.751
NO.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.396
- YOU LEAVE, BURT,

41:17.440 --> 41:19.203
YOU DON'T TAKE
THAT COMPANY CAR WITH YOU.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.902
THINK IT THROUGH.

41:23.310 --> 41:24.971
- THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED

41:25.010 --> 41:27.376
I NEEDED TO DO
SOMETHING BOLD.

41:27.410 --> 41:28.809
- MM-HMM.

41:36.890 --> 41:38.448
- [sighs]

41:38.490 --> 41:41.994
- REAL BOLD.

41:42.030 --> 41:44.897
- MM.

41:52.240 --> 41:55.073
- MY NAME IS BURTON GUSTER.

41:55.110 --> 41:57.772
I'M A REALIST, A DREAMER,
AN ADVENTURER,

41:57.810 --> 42:00.074
A LOVER OF HARRY POTTER,

42:00.110 --> 42:02.510
VINTAGE SAFES,
ALL THINGS JAMAICAN.

42:02.550 --> 42:04.586
AND I WANNA SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE

42:04.620 --> 42:07.339
MAKING YOU THE CENTER
OF MY UNIVERSE.

42:07.390 --> 42:09.551
A UNIVERSE THAT CONTAINS
A SOLAR SYSTEM

42:09.590 --> 42:12.229
WITH NINE PLANETS.

42:12.260 --> 42:14.524
IN WE BOUGHT A ZOO,
MATT DAMON PROMISES

42:14.560 --> 42:17.654
THAT IF WE CAN HAVE 20 SECONDS
OF INSANE COURAGE,

42:17.700 --> 42:20.999
SOMETHING GREAT
WILL COME OUT OF IT.

42:21.030 --> 42:22.531
WELL...

42:22.570 --> 42:27.928
THIS IS MY MOMENT
OF EMBARRASSING BRAVERY.

42:32.580 --> 42:35.640
UH, THAT DIDN'T PLAY OUT
THE WAY I PLANNED IT.

42:35.680 --> 42:38.171
CAN I TAKE THE SPEECH OVER?

42:38.220 --> 42:40.108
MY NAME IS BURTON GUSTER.

42:40.150 --> 42:43.017
[screams]

42:43.060 --> 42:44.379
GOSH!

42:44.420 --> 42:48.595
SHAWN, WE BOUGHT A ZOO LIED.

42:50.200 --> 42:53.169
- SORRY, MAN.

42:53.200 --> 42:56.863
- [whimpers]

42:56.900 --> 43:00.336
OH, GOSH.

43:00.370 --> 43:02.873
OH, NO, NO, NO.

43:02.910 --> 43:07.142
[whimpers]
OH, GOSH.

43:07.180 --> 43:08.818
- HOW MANY TIMES
DID YOU TURN AROUND?

43:08.850 --> 43:10.875
- 12.

43:10.920 --> 43:13.480
BUT LOOK AT ME NOW, SHAWN.
I AM HERE.

43:13.520 --> 43:16.512
I FOUND MYSELF,
AND NOT AT A 9:00-TO-5:00,

43:16.560 --> 43:19.256
BUT WITH MY CLOSEST FRIEND,
SOLVING CRIMES,

43:19.290 --> 43:20.848
LIVING LIFE TO THE FULLEST.

43:20.890 --> 43:23.222
AND IF WE HAVE TO DO IT
A LITTLE FURTHER UP THE COAST,

43:23.260 --> 43:24.625
THEN THAT'S
WHAT WE'LL HAVE TO DO.

43:24.670 --> 43:27.059
SO BE IT.

43:29.940 --> 43:31.134
JULES.

43:31.170 --> 43:32.239
CHIEF.

43:32.270 --> 43:33.464
- MR. GUSTER.

43:33.510 --> 43:34.499
- YOU GUYS, LOOK AT US.

43:34.540 --> 43:35.905
WE'RE ALL HERE.

43:35.940 --> 43:37.305
WE CAN SET UP SHOP HERE.
WHAT?

43:37.340 --> 43:39.342
WE C--WE CAN SOLVE CRIMES.

43:39.380 --> 43:40.506
AND, CHIEF, WE'RE GONNA
BE TWICE AS EFFICIENT NOW.

43:40.550 --> 43:42.142
WANNA KNOW WHY?

43:42.180 --> 43:44.045
'CAUSE WE HAVE
TWO STEERING WHEELS.

43:44.080 --> 43:47.618
LOOK AT GUS.
HE'S UNSTOPPABLE.

43:47.650 --> 43:49.709
HE'S LIKE WESLEY IN TO WONG FOO.
- WHAT?

43:49.760 --> 43:54.026
- UM, BUT, MR. SPENCER,
WE ALREADY HAVE A GUY.

43:54.060 --> 43:55.288
- WHAT?
- OH, REALLY?

43:55.330 --> 43:56.456
- MM-HMM.
- THAT'S FUNNY.

43:56.500 --> 43:57.524
I-I DON'T SEE HIM.

43:57.560 --> 43:58.925
- HE'S IN THE KITCHEN,

43:58.970 --> 44:01.564
ALPHABETIZING THE PANTRY.

44:01.600 --> 44:04.296
- WHAT?

44:04.340 --> 44:06.035
BUT HE CAN'T POSSIBLY
BE AS GOOD AS US.

44:06.070 --> 44:08.971
- NOPE.

44:09.010 --> 44:10.932
- WE'LL SEE.
- HMM.

44:13.680 --> 44:16.240
- COME ON, GUYS,
LET'S HUG IT OUT.

44:16.280 --> 44:20.182
COME ON.
- OH!

44:20.220 --> 44:21.642
OKAY, MR. SPENCER.

44:21.690 --> 44:23.009
YOU'RE NOW STANDING
ON THE DEAD BODY.

44:23.060 --> 44:25.722
- MM-HMM.
- MM.

44:31.430 --> 44:33.421
- OH, MY GOSH, GUS.

44:33.470 --> 44:35.131
THIS IS GONNA BE SO INCREDIBLE.
- UH-HUH.

44:35.170 --> 44:36.569
- JUST LIKE IT WAS BEFORE,
ONLY BIGGER AND BETTER,

44:36.600 --> 44:38.329
WITH MORE WINERIES.

44:38.370 --> 44:39.405
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING.
- WHAT?

44:39.440 --> 44:41.362
- YOU.

44:41.410 --> 44:42.934
I MADE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
OF MY LIFE

44:42.980 --> 44:44.902
BY LEAVING SANTA BARBARA
WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE TO GUS,

44:44.950 --> 44:47.669
AND I AM DONE COWERING
FROM THE BIG DECISIONS.

44:47.710 --> 44:51.111
I'VE WANTED THIS
FOR LONG ENOUGH.

44:52.750 --> 44:55.514
SO IT'S GONNA HAPPEN...

44:55.560 --> 44:57.585
RIGHT NOW.

44:57.620 --> 44:58.951
- SHAWN?

44:58.990 --> 45:03.654
WH--IS--IS THIS THE TIME?

45:03.700 --> 45:05.065
- YOU BET YOUR ASS IT IS.

45:05.100 --> 45:07.819
JULIET O'HARA,

45:07.870 --> 45:09.667
I DO NOT BELIEVE
IN LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT

45:09.700 --> 45:11.588
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
EVEN NEED TO SEE YOU

45:11.640 --> 45:15.098
TO KNOW THAT I WANTED
TO SPEND FOREVER WITH YOU.

45:18.610 --> 45:20.601
THAT DIDN'T MAKE
A TON OF SENSE, DID IT?

45:20.650 --> 45:23.744
- THE CENTER OF YOUR UNIVERSE,
NINE PLANETS.

45:23.780 --> 45:25.486
- GUS, HAS THAT PLUTO LINE
EVER WORKED ON ANYBODY?

45:25.520 --> 45:26.839
- NO.

45:26.890 --> 45:29.757
- I'M GONNA GET BACK IN THERE.

45:29.790 --> 45:30.779
SCRATCH THAT.

45:30.820 --> 45:32.321
I HAVE SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE

45:32.360 --> 45:33.952
RUNNING FROM ONE THING
TO ANOTHER.

45:33.990 --> 45:35.924
QUITTING AND RUNNING
AND QUITTING AND RUNNING

45:35.960 --> 45:39.123
AND PRETENDING THAT MY DESTINY
WAS TO DRIVE A WIENERMOBILE.

45:39.170 --> 45:40.660
- HE WAS YOUNG AND AFRAID
OF COMMITMENT.

45:40.700 --> 45:44.261
- THAT'S TRUE,
BUT I'M NOT THAT YOUNG ANYMORE,

45:44.300 --> 45:46.336
AND I'M ALSO NOT AFRAID.

45:46.370 --> 45:49.737
BECAUSE WHEN I'M WITH YOU,
JULES, I'M JUST FEARLESS,

45:49.780 --> 45:52.374
AND--AND I'M UNBREAKABLE.

45:52.410 --> 45:54.742
- LIKE SAMUEL L. JACKSON.

45:54.780 --> 45:57.613
- NO, SAM JACKSON
WAS THE GLASS MAN.

45:57.650 --> 45:58.912
- NOT EMOTIONALLY, SHAWN.

45:58.950 --> 46:01.680
NOT EMOTIONALLY.

46:01.720 --> 46:04.154
- OKAY, I NEED YOU TO DIAL
IT BACK JUST A TEENY BIT.

46:04.190 --> 46:06.727
- [voice cracking]
O-OKAY.

46:06.760 --> 46:08.489
- I KNOW
THAT I COME WITH BAGGAGE

46:08.530 --> 46:10.498
AND A BEST FRIEND
WHO'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE EVER.

46:10.530 --> 46:13.124
BUT I PROMISE YOU
THAT FROM THIS MOMENT FORWARD,

46:13.170 --> 46:15.695
THE ONLY RUNNING THAT I
WILL BE DOING IS INTO YOUR ARMS.

46:15.740 --> 46:19.130
AND I WILL NEVER STOP HOLDING
YOUR COLD LITTLE HANDS

46:19.170 --> 46:21.661
OR LOSING MYSELF
WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING

46:21.710 --> 46:24.599
AND LOOK AT YOU AND RECOGNIZE
HOW FRICKIN' LUCKY I AM.

46:24.640 --> 46:26.403
- OH, MY GOSH.
OH, MY GOSH.

46:26.450 --> 46:28.304
IT'S HAPPENING.
SAY YES.

46:28.350 --> 46:30.011
- YES!

46:30.050 --> 46:33.417
- O-OKAY, BUT TECHNICALLY,
YOU JUST SAID YES TO GUS.

46:33.450 --> 46:34.781
- WELL, ASK ME, SHAWN.

46:34.820 --> 46:36.981
- OKAY.

46:37.020 --> 46:39.022
JULES, WILL YOU MARRY US?
ME.

46:39.060 --> 46:40.721
MOSTLY ME.
- YEAH.

46:40.760 --> 46:42.557
- EVEN THOUGH GUS IS ALWAYS
GONNA BE PART OF THE DEAL.

46:42.600 --> 46:43.953
AND THEN SOME DAY,
HE'LL HAVE HIS OWN JULIET,

46:44.000 --> 46:45.729
AND HER NAME
WILL BE "JULI-AY."

46:45.770 --> 46:46.964
AND SHE'LL BE JAMAICAN.
- OH, YEAH.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.627
- AND TOGETHER,
WE'LL BE ONE BIG,

46:48.670 --> 46:50.535
GIANT, FROSTED,
BLACK-AND-WHITE COOKIE.

46:50.570 --> 46:53.368
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE DOGS,
ALL RESCUES.

46:53.410 --> 46:54.877
AND KIDS,
PROBABLY BEFORE WE'RE 60.

46:54.910 --> 46:57.276
- OH,
WAY, WAY BEFORE 60.

46:57.310 --> 46:58.800
- OH, JUST MARRY ME
SO THAT I CAN SHOW YOU

46:58.850 --> 47:00.374
HOW AMAZING
OUR LIFE WILL BE TOGETHER.

47:00.410 --> 47:02.469
- YES.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.715
YES, I WILL MARRY THE CRAP
OUT OF YOU, SHAWN SPENCER.

47:04.750 --> 47:07.446
NOW GIVE ME THE RING.

47:07.490 --> 47:08.514
- OH, MY GOD!

47:08.550 --> 47:10.211
- HEY! HEY!

47:10.260 --> 47:11.613
THAT'S MY GRANDMOTHER'S!
- OH, MY GOD.

47:11.660 --> 47:12.888
- WHAT THE HELL
KIND OF CITY IS THIS?

47:12.930 --> 47:16.525
- NO, NO, I GOT THIS!

47:16.560 --> 47:18.721
- THAT'S YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S?

47:18.760 --> 47:19.761
- COME ON, LET'S DO THIS!

47:19.800 --> 47:20.892
- WHAT IS THIS CAR?

47:20.930 --> 47:22.488
AND WHY IS THE WINDOW BROKEN?

47:22.540 --> 47:24.360
- IT'S TECHNICALLY STOLEN.
HOLD ON.

47:27.210 --> 47:29.098
- DUDE, HE WENT RIGHT.
- HE WENT LEFT.

47:29.140 --> 47:30.732
- LET GO OF THE WHEEL.
- YOU LET GO OF THE WHEEL.

47:30.780 --> 47:31.906
I HAVE THE GAS.

47:31.950 --> 47:33.042
- DO NOT MAKE ME
SLAM THE BRAKES.

47:33.080 --> 47:34.445
