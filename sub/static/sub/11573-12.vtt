WEBVTT

00:04.505 --> 00:08.623
There's all kinds of rifle
action here, here, and here.

00:08.718 --> 00:11.425
Well, I will be way over on the
other side of the ridge, Papa Bear,

00:11.512 --> 00:13.173
so you don't have to
worry about my ass.

00:13.264 --> 00:16.427
And let me just state for
the record, what an ass.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.849
--He||o, beautiful.
--Hi.

00:18.936 --> 00:21.348
Are you guys planning a raid on
some backwoods moonshiners?

00:21.439 --> 00:24.055
Hell no. Scored
myself a long weekend.

00:24.150 --> 00:26.516
So, I'm going bear hunting.

00:26.611 --> 00:30.069
Ooh, orange vests, rifles, and
beer coolers. Sign me the hell up.

00:30.156 --> 00:32.147
That ain't the way I hunt, babe.

00:32.241 --> 00:37.110
Listen, if you kill Yogi and BooBoo,
I am never talking to you again.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.536
You part of this sunny expedition?

00:38.623 --> 00:43.037
Shit. The closest | get to a bear
is a rug in front of a fireplace.

00:43.127 --> 00:46.415
My boy's forest playtime
is strictly a solo affair.

00:46.505 --> 00:49.121
Oh, hang on one second.
You have been so busy at work

00:49.217 --> 00:51.208
that we've barely seen each other
and now you're going to spend

00:51.302 --> 00:53.714
the weekend alone in the woods?

00:53.804 --> 00:55.931
We could go away together.

00:57.516 --> 00:59.643
Is that too relationship-y?

00:59.727 --> 01:02.434
Just enough. What do
you have in mind?

01:02.521 --> 01:03.852
I don't know.

01:03.940 --> 01:06.397
Why don't you come over tonight
and we can put our heads together

01:06.484 --> 01:08.566
and come up with
some place nice to go.

01:08.653 --> 01:12.487
You and I put our heads together,
we usually don't do a lot of figuring.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.819
I can never tell with those
two if they're on or off.

01:19.914 --> 01:23.748
I'd put money on them fighting again
in two weeks and back to square one.

01:26.712 --> 01:29.875
I pick the 14th for
them hitting the skids.

01:29.966 --> 01:32.002
Closest one to the date
wins twenty bucks.

01:32.093 --> 01:36.382
In the event of a tie, we go
down to the hour and the minute.

01:37.723 --> 01:39.304
Deal, buddy.

02:07.420 --> 02:10.537
Ahh!

02:14.260 --> 02:16.717
[screaming]

02:19.432 --> 02:22.390
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.343
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

02:25.438 --> 02:28.350
My love carries a death sentence.

02:28.441 --> 02:30.557
l was lost for years,

02:30.651 --> 02:33.313
searching, while hiding,

02:33.404 --> 02:37.522
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

02:37.616 --> 02:42.531
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

02:48.794 --> 02:52.787
[B0] The Balamar Spa looks nice.

02:52.882 --> 02:58.502
Three words--green tea colonics.
That sounds so refreshing.

02:58.596 --> 03:01.884
Okay. How about the Wobomack B&B?

03:01.974 --> 03:05.057
Yeah. That one's run
by a couple of faeries.

03:05.144 --> 03:06.680
Literally. I mean, like,
wings and everything.

03:06.771 --> 03:09.057
Flitting around, getting in
your business. Not relaxing.

03:09.148 --> 03:11.355
And whom, pray tell,
did you go there with?

03:11.442 --> 03:14.684
Actually, don't answer that.
Let's just... let's just pick one.

03:14.779 --> 03:18.442
Well, then it's got to
be the theme motel.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.114
Look, they got a pirate room. Arr.

03:21.202 --> 03:24.945
You've been alive for centuries and
you're still an eight-year-old boy.

03:25.039 --> 03:28.156
Okay, I'm really sorry to
interrupt rubber ducky time,

03:28.250 --> 03:30.036
but we've got a client consult.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.037
Now?

03:31.128 --> 03:34.962
Yes. It's a guy I know from my
once less-than-legit exploits.

03:35.049 --> 03:36.960
So, I kind of owe him.

03:37.051 --> 03:40.009
So... thank you!

03:40.096 --> 03:41.381
Nice timing, Kenzi.

03:41.472 --> 03:43.428
[KENZI] Any time, baby.

03:43.516 --> 03:45.598
Great.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.140
[BO] So, what's up?

03:47.228 --> 03:49.435
Hi. Kenzi says you're
a P.|. or some shit?

03:49.522 --> 03:50.853
Yeah, I solve problems.

03:50.940 --> 03:54.979
Rad, man, 'cause I got a big problem.
My cousin, Thumper, he's gone missing.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.650
Your cousin's a rabbit?

03:56.737 --> 03:59.274
What? No. It's like a street name.

03:59.365 --> 04:02.573
You know, this one used
to be called Meow Meow.

04:02.660 --> 04:03.775
Anybody want a beer?

04:03.869 --> 04:05.575
Meow Meow?

04:05.663 --> 04:08.621
Anyway, look, he's only been in the
country, like, three months now

04:08.707 --> 04:10.698
and he's an illegal.

04:10.793 --> 04:13.034
Well, what makes you
think he's gone missing?

04:13.129 --> 04:15.040
Cheers. We work together.

04:15.131 --> 04:17.463
One day, just like that,
doesn't show up for his ride home.

04:17.550 --> 04:18.505
Well, where's work?

04:18.592 --> 04:20.093
Queensdale Country Club.

04:20.177 --> 04:22.554
I got him a job there. You know,
he takes care of the grounds.

04:22.638 --> 04:25.095
Yeah, Neville works in the kitchen.

04:25.182 --> 04:27.389
Well, I'm assuming you
already asked around work?

04:27.476 --> 04:30.468
Man, | practically took a nine iron to
his boss's skull looking for answers.

04:30.563 --> 04:32.303
You know what that
son of a bitch says?

04:32.398 --> 04:34.184
He says he left midway
through his shift.

04:34.275 --> 04:36.732
Like, obviously, he's got no
work ethic 'cause he's foreign.

04:36.819 --> 04:38.434
Right. And you can't go to the cops.

04:38.529 --> 04:41.396
Can't go to the cops unless
I want to get him deported.

04:41.490 --> 04:46.905
Man, that club, okay...

04:46.996 --> 04:48.736
...there's some weird-ass
stuff that goes on there.

04:48.831 --> 04:49.741
We're listening.

04:49.832 --> 04:54.792
Like, they go out of their
way to hire illegals.

04:54.879 --> 04:57.211
They were the ones that came
to me, asking me if I had any

04:57.298 --> 04:59.459
friends and relatives that
want to work under the table?

04:59.550 --> 05:01.211
Yeah, 'cause illegals work for nothing.

05:01.302 --> 05:04.635
No. Because maybe these rich
people are selling them into slavery,

05:04.722 --> 05:07.008
or maybe they're stealing
their organs or some shit.

05:07.099 --> 05:09.636
Look, I'm sorry. Okay, I know
this sounds crazy to you.

05:09.727 --> 05:12.434
Don't worry. We have heard
much weirder, trust me.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.512
We're going to find out
what happened to him, okay.

05:14.607 --> 05:18.020
Cross my heart, man, cross my heart.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.943
Thanks. That's the old Meow Meow.

05:21.030 --> 05:22.986
Are there any more tips
that you can give us?

05:23.073 --> 05:27.908
Yeah, this gossip queen at the
club is this chick named Blake.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.828
If anything ever goes down, I bet
she knows where to start looking.

05:30.915 --> 05:34.533
How do you guys plan on
getting close, anyway?

05:36.712 --> 05:37.952
No way.

05:38.047 --> 05:40.789
Okay, I would be the one going
undercover as kitchen staff.

05:40.883 --> 05:44.125
You get to pretend to be a
member and live the good life.

05:44.220 --> 05:46.427
Well, you guys are going
to have a great time, alone.

05:46.514 --> 05:47.754
I'm on vacation, remember?

05:47.848 --> 05:51.761
Hey, my cover will work so much
better if you come in as my husband.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.513
Is that a proposal?

05:53.604 --> 05:55.970
Come on. You would be helping
me do a solid for a friend.

05:56.065 --> 05:58.226
He's your pal. He's not mine.

05:58.317 --> 06:01.434
Remind me, what was that time
where you were wanted for murder

06:01.529 --> 06:03.611
and I totally covered your ass?

06:03.697 --> 06:06.905
--You totally saved his life too, right?
--You know, now that you mention it,

06:06.992 --> 06:10.826
I think that you're right. Without
asking for anything in return.

06:10.913 --> 06:13.780
Come on, you are
going to look so sweet

06:13.874 --> 06:16.115
in a polo shirt and a pair of chinos.

06:16.210 --> 06:17.746
[KENZI] Ha, ha.

06:20.464 --> 06:20.577
Forty-seven acres of the
Queensdale Country Club.

06:20.589 --> 06:22.705
Forty-seven acres of the
Queensdale Country Club.

06:22.800 --> 06:26.839
| supervised construction
on every inch of this heaven.

06:26.929 --> 06:28.760
Step into my office.

06:31.475 --> 06:34.057
Harvard, Oxford.

06:34.144 --> 06:38.228
Sailed in the Governor's Cup.
This is great stuff.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.896
Now, do you ever find
you have problems

06:39.984 --> 06:43.192
keeping up with your
wife's employment?

06:43.279 --> 06:46.362
Oh no, the bank is generous with
transfers when you're top tier.

06:46.448 --> 06:49.281
And how long have you been
with the U.N., Mrs. Thornwood?

06:49.368 --> 06:53.862
Oh, three years. One in
Germany and two in Belgium.

06:53.956 --> 06:56.322
Working in human
rights is so rewarding.

06:56.417 --> 07:00.285
Sure. Sure. And I bet you rub
shoulders with some heavy hitters.

07:00.379 --> 07:02.961
Those U.N. parties must be something.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.960
Well, Dyson finds them quite tedious.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.633
So, I'm always looking for a
more enthusiastic plus one.

07:08.721 --> 07:10.461
Well, I don't think we're
going to have any problem

07:10.556 --> 07:14.515
green-lighting this application. You
should hear from us in about a month.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.184
Actually, Mitch, we were
rather hoping to join the club--

07:17.271 --> 07:20.889
[BO] As soon as possible.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.730
--Would today work?
--That would make me very happy.

07:25.821 --> 07:28.654
One probationary
membership coming right up.

07:28.741 --> 07:30.606
Ah, two.

07:30.701 --> 07:34.114
Two probationary
memberships coming up.

07:36.248 --> 07:39.866
You are such a peach.
I could just eat you right up.

07:39.960 --> 07:45.000
If you want, I can give you
a personal orientation tour.

07:45.090 --> 07:48.253
Oh, no. We don't want to take
you away from your busy work.

07:48.344 --> 07:52.883
But there is one member
we've heard so much about.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.886
--Blake something?
--Blake Jorgenson. Yeah.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.969
She's a bit of a...

08:00.064 --> 08:01.929
She's always on the tennis court,
if you're looking for her.

08:02.024 --> 08:05.232
Okay, great. We'll find her.

08:05.319 --> 08:10.404
And, Mitch, we will see you later.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.537
[AMY] Long way from Venezuela.

08:22.628 --> 08:28.589
[KENZI] Si. Si. I am working my way
around the continent, kitchen to kitchen.

08:28.676 --> 08:31.463
Mitch says you plan on sticking
around for a few months?

08:31.553 --> 08:35.922
At least. Though I hear
you have a high turnover,

08:36.016 --> 08:40.555
especially when it comes
to people without visas.

08:40.646 --> 08:44.264
Don't screw up. No one will
call immigration, I promise.

08:44.358 --> 08:49.148
What about the members? Any
horror stories I should know about?

08:49.238 --> 08:50.853
Oh, they're all nouveau riche.

08:50.948 --> 08:54.281
Most have what they have
because of connections and luck.

08:54.368 --> 08:57.235
It's not because they're
endowed with talent or brains.

08:57.329 --> 09:00.446
Stay on their good side, but
don't let them intimidate you.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.702
--Si.
--Hey!

09:02.793 --> 09:07.332
And no snacking on the job.
That's a fireable offence.

09:07.423 --> 09:10.540
Si, seﬁora. Uh huh. Uh huh.

09:16.348 --> 09:17.849
Nice backhand.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.719
Perfected it on my ex-husband.

09:19.810 --> 09:23.018
I'm Bo Thornwood.
This is my husband, Dyson.

09:23.105 --> 09:24.015
Fresh blood?

09:24.106 --> 09:26.688
Yeah, we just joined.
Been out of the country.

09:26.775 --> 09:29.152
We've been travelling
so much, I'm a little rusty.

09:29.236 --> 09:32.023
A good stiff one usually
loosens me right up.

09:32.114 --> 09:33.149
[BO] Excuse me?

09:33.240 --> 09:36.198
Drink. Stiff drink.

09:37.745 --> 09:38.655
l'm Blake.

09:38.746 --> 09:44.082
Yeah, I know. I would love to get the
scoop on this place from a real insider.

09:44.168 --> 09:46.534
Do you have lunch plans?

09:47.963 --> 09:51.547
Well, aren't you two adorable? Let's go.

09:55.554 --> 09:57.090
Here's the truth.

09:57.181 --> 10:02.096
This place is nothing but a
bunch of ass-kissing wannabes.

10:02.186 --> 10:04.893
Most of them are peasants in Gucci.

10:04.980 --> 10:08.347
I'm not sure they even played
fair to get what they have.

10:09.735 --> 10:11.976
You're very good at that, seﬁora.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.526
Thank you, seﬁor.

10:13.614 --> 10:16.447
Are we talking dodgy accounting or...?

10:16.533 --> 10:20.367
Mitch and Chloe have this
rather exclusive clique.

10:20.454 --> 10:24.948
--And Chloe is...?
--His wife. The bitch of the ball.

10:25.042 --> 10:32.630
Look at her. Cheap teeth,
cheap tan, cheap tits.

10:32.716 --> 10:35.207
It beats me what they get
up to behind closed doors,

10:35.302 --> 10:38.089
but they've all made each
other obscenely rich.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.967
And which closed
doors would those be?

10:41.058 --> 10:47.304
Every month, their little group has an
after-hours, invite-only scotch tasting.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.272
Probably to plot world domination.

10:51.360 --> 10:54.193
Well, sounds pretty juicy.
I'd love a peek.

10:54.279 --> 10:57.897
--[KENZ|] Oh, seﬁora, I'm so sorry.
--[CHLOE] Are you kidding me?

11:00.202 --> 11:02.659
What is your name?

11:02.746 --> 11:04.361
I'm sorry.

11:05.624 --> 11:08.491
Remind me to tip that one.

11:23.934 --> 11:27.392
Complaint's already been logged
against you. That's one strike, kid.

11:27.479 --> 11:31.563
Oh, sorry, Jefe. It won't happen again.

11:31.650 --> 11:34.642
No, it better not. Every
strike goes in the file.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.351
There's a file?

11:36.446 --> 11:39.688
Mitch keeps it. Every screw-up
by every staff member.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.193
Neville, get the soup base started.

11:41.285 --> 11:43.867
I'm going to go pick some
fresh squash from the garden.

11:43.954 --> 11:45.569
Yes, Chef.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.827
You watch yourself, Kenzi, or
you'll be out before you know it.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.625
My boy Thumper had himself two
strikes before he disappeared.

11:52.713 --> 11:55.250
The manager's wife
was itching to fire him.

12:01.179 --> 12:03.044
--Blake, honey.
--Oh, lord.

12:03.140 --> 12:05.552
You submitted your nomination
papers for the board election?

12:05.642 --> 12:08.509
I did. Was there some problem?

12:08.604 --> 12:13.018
No. No. | just wanted to have an
informal chat, board chair to nominee.

12:13.108 --> 12:15.315
Make sure we're on the same page.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.984
--Why?
--Well, if I like your platform,

12:18.071 --> 12:19.356
I can give you the benefit of my sway--

12:19.448 --> 12:23.612
Your reign's ending, Chloe.
But when | get my seat on the board,

12:23.702 --> 12:27.445
you're going to see a lot
more dividends come my way.

12:29.207 --> 12:31.664
That's what I was afraid of.

12:37.341 --> 12:38.797
Fore!

12:42.429 --> 12:46.593
I think we made a mistake
with your membership, Blake.

12:46.683 --> 12:50.676
You're not Queensdale
material after all.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.807
She's all yours.

13:01.239 --> 13:05.733
[groaning]

13:19.091 --> 13:20.501
You're in real trouble, missy.

13:20.592 --> 13:24.176
There may be nothing
anybody can do to help you.

13:24.262 --> 13:28.972
Uh, excuse me. l have to go
meet somebody about something.

13:33.814 --> 13:38.228
You are really good at
this undercover stuff.

13:38.318 --> 13:41.025
Who knew you could be
so duplicitous, huh.

13:41.113 --> 13:43.149
--|'ve got my secrets.
--Oh, yeah?

13:43.240 --> 13:45.356
Well, you can't keep
any secrets from me.

13:45.450 --> 13:49.443
It's just one of the things
that I love about you.

13:49.538 --> 13:53.872
Ohh. Off 'til my late shift.

13:53.959 --> 13:57.326
Oh, god, public transit sucks tail.

13:57.421 --> 14:00.584
Seﬁorita, the servant's
entrance is in the rear.

14:00.674 --> 14:03.040
Yeah, bite my rear, dog-breath, okay?

14:03.135 --> 14:05.217
| just had to stand on the
subway for forty-five minutes

14:05.303 --> 14:07.965
while a woman clipped
her nails in my face

14:08.056 --> 14:11.594
and a guy was poking what I can only
hope to be a baguette into my back.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.550
Okay! And my feet really, really hurt.

14:13.645 --> 14:16.136
So, somebody please give
me a foot massage, stat.

14:16.231 --> 14:17.516
Well, what did you find out?

14:17.607 --> 14:21.941
Oh, that the club does
employ tons of illegals,

14:22.029 --> 14:25.112
and a bunch of them
have gone missing and...

14:25.198 --> 14:28.156
Oh my god, that's amazing.

14:28.243 --> 14:31.280
Oh my god, I can almost forget
how mad I am at you guys.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.532
Know any Fae that prey
on foreign employees?

14:33.623 --> 14:35.579
Nothing points to this being Fae.

14:35.667 --> 14:39.330
Oh, come on. Somebody at that place
is disappearing immigrant workers.

14:39.421 --> 14:41.127
Oh, and I think you should know,

14:41.214 --> 14:44.456
our client's cousin was on
the manager's wife's hit list.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.837
Apparently, he was a real slack-ass.

14:46.928 --> 14:49.340
Look, that is not a
reason to kill someone.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.638
For all we know, these people
are just working elsewhere.

14:51.725 --> 14:55.968
My gut says otherwise,
and come on, so does yours.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.145
Okay. I'll get Hale to do a
background check on members.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.266
Maybe it'll raise a flag.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.484
And I say we crash that
scotch tasting tonight.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.025
See if we can infiltrate
their inner circle.

15:04.112 --> 15:05.773
Think you can get us in?

15:05.864 --> 15:07.650
Watch me.

15:07.741 --> 15:12.110
[snoring]

15:20.504 --> 15:25.715
Well, looky, everyone getting
all glamorous for a night out.

15:25.801 --> 15:29.419
Yeah, well, some of us are having
less glamorous nights than others.

15:29.513 --> 15:31.549
So, thanks, guys.

15:31.640 --> 15:32.720
What did you find?

15:32.808 --> 15:36.096
Spent all afternoon digging
into club members' finances.

15:36.186 --> 15:37.346
You know, it still creeps me out

15:37.437 --> 15:39.849
that the Fae can access
everyone's bank accounts.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.727
Really? 'Cause it kind of creeps me
out that they consider humans

15:42.818 --> 15:44.729
to be one of the four
basic food groups.

15:44.820 --> 15:46.902
Oh, yeah, and in case
anybody is wondering,

15:46.988 --> 15:49.024
I'm pretty sure the
creepy groundskeeper

15:49.116 --> 15:52.199
is sizing me up to fit in a bun.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.947
Must have just been
looking for a snack.

15:55.038 --> 16:00.158
Anyway, only strange thing I turned up
is plenty of the country club members

16:00.252 --> 16:04.586
had significant bumps in their bank
accounts shortly after joining the club.

16:04.673 --> 16:09.167
Maybe it's a kickback scheme from
pay-offs or bribes. Who knows?

16:09.261 --> 16:12.424
Maybe Thumper got iced out
'cause he found something out.

16:12.514 --> 16:13.629
[BO] Well, that'll be our
plan of attack tonight.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.975
We'll hit these people up for
information and figure out

16:16.059 --> 16:19.722
exactly how they got their sudden
wealth. And while we do that--

16:19.813 --> 16:22.646
I will let myself into
Herr Director's office

16:22.732 --> 16:25.018
and see if I can find
anything incriminating.

16:25.110 --> 16:27.897
--[HALE] And I'll have your back.
--[KENZ|] Yeah.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.319
--Can I have a gun?
--[HALE] No.

16:29.406 --> 16:30.816
--Grenades?
--No.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.159
A magic sword? Come on.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.486
What, are you modelling
for J. Crew now?

16:37.581 --> 16:39.117
What do you want, Saskia?

16:39.207 --> 16:41.949
Oh, I don't know, a 24/7
international orgy,

16:42.043 --> 16:44.329
but I'll settle for a night on the
town with my fellow sex-fiend.

16:44.421 --> 16:45.831
That's a no from me.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.038
Oh, come on, be a sport.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.089
Look, I don't like how we left things.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.667
I think we need a fresh start.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.968
And there's a certain
debauched rock band in town.

16:54.055 --> 16:55.841
I'm talking sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll

16:55.932 --> 16:58.264
at a level so high,
you need NASA training.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.603
l have plans.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.679
With the Ken Doll? You're not serious.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.183
What if it is serious?

17:05.275 --> 17:09.939
Oh, honey, are you going around
with him? Is he your steady?

17:10.030 --> 17:12.316
'Cause that would make you
the lamest succubus in history.

17:12.407 --> 17:13.487
Good night, Saskia.

17:13.575 --> 17:16.282
You don't know what you're missing.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.327
It's chilly outside.
Don't forget your sweater.

17:24.002 --> 17:25.788
Who was that?

17:25.879 --> 17:28.621
Just... just an old client.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.377
Someone I couldn't help.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.959
What do you say we have
James bring the car around?

17:34.054 --> 17:36.090
Indeed.

17:36.181 --> 17:37.921
Okay, let's go.

17:39.559 --> 17:43.427
We don't usually let newcomers
join our little soiree.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.182
We're so grateful. Aren't we, babe?

17:45.273 --> 17:47.138
Oh, we are so grateful.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.646
See, we really believe
in community, Mitch.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.648
And we can tell that you and your
gang are exactly our kind of people.

17:52.739 --> 17:55.276
Oh, everyone will find
you quite simpatico.

17:55.367 --> 17:59.451
Now, there is one thing--this isn't
your standard scotch tasting.

18:01.206 --> 18:04.414
Ha!

18:04.501 --> 18:06.867
Welcome to scotch night.

18:11.633 --> 18:17.094
Hey, newbies. Come on in.
The water's perfect.

18:40.912 --> 18:43.369
I'd say you're a little too
good at that, short stuff.

18:43.456 --> 18:48.166
It's a vocation. And call me short one
more time and I'm going to cut you.

18:48.253 --> 18:51.916
Temper's short. I'd say you're
a little touchy tonight.

18:52.007 --> 18:54.669
Yeah. Well, if you were already
on these rich freaks' hit list,

18:54.759 --> 18:57.501
you would be touchy, too.
So, take a look at the damn files

18:57.595 --> 18:59.881
and I'm going to boot up this bad boy.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.429
A little, uh, spicy

19:01.516 --> 19:03.848
[KENZI] Uh huh.

19:03.935 --> 19:06.677
Well, let the long night
of research begin.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.511
Welcome to half my job.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.983
I know, right? Same old story.
You and me do all the grunt work

19:11.067 --> 19:13.729
while Bo and Dyson
get all the damn glory.

19:13.820 --> 19:17.062
Let's hope tonight, they are suffering.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.773
So, this is nice.

19:19.868 --> 19:23.235
Yes, it's delightful.
So much better than hunting.

19:23.330 --> 19:26.493
[CHLOE] You hunt? That's so primal.

19:26.583 --> 19:29.575
[BO] You have no idea.

19:29.669 --> 19:33.753
So, Blake, she's not part of
these little soirees of yours?

19:33.840 --> 19:35.341
She seems pretty A-list to me.

19:35.425 --> 19:39.168
Oh, Blake is a valued member,
but she's not really a team player.

19:39.262 --> 19:42.629
Oh, midnight snack.
What's on the menu?

19:42.724 --> 19:45.010
Grilled flatbread with
tomato and chives,

19:45.101 --> 19:47.387
mixed vegetables with
a squash tapenade.

19:47.479 --> 19:52.348
Amy's food is to die for. And it's
all fresh from our own garden.

19:52.442 --> 19:55.400
My darling.

19:55.487 --> 19:58.229
I would say that Mitch
is hiding something.

19:59.491 --> 20:02.358
I would say he's not hiding enough.

20:05.413 --> 20:06.573
Hi.

20:06.664 --> 20:09.747
Oh, yeah.

20:13.922 --> 20:16.004
There's nothing in the damn computer.

20:16.091 --> 20:18.548
All these stories are
about members' success

20:18.635 --> 20:20.751
and they're dated after each
member joined the club.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.881
What kind of success?

20:22.972 --> 20:28.262
Job promotions, business
expansion, real estate deals.

20:28.353 --> 20:31.561
Not to mention all their
appearances in the society pages.

20:31.648 --> 20:35.561
Man! Belonging to this club
means you have arrived.

20:35.652 --> 20:39.395
Maybe it's a secret society like they're
all pulling strings for each other.

20:39.489 --> 20:42.196
What do you have in
the employee files?

20:42.283 --> 20:46.401
It's really stupid, but Mitch left
files on all the illegal workers.

20:46.496 --> 20:48.987
Which you would figure
is not the smartest thing,

20:49.082 --> 20:51.448
from a law enforcement point of view.

20:51.543 --> 20:56.788
Uh huh. Oh my god, look at this.
Strikes for screwing up on the job.

20:56.881 --> 20:59.338
Look at this! I already have
two strikes. What the hell?

20:59.426 --> 21:01.712
You should be more
worried about that picture.

21:03.346 --> 21:08.431
Oh, wow, looks like, yeah,
the most anyone has is three.

21:13.898 --> 21:15.638
[KENZI] It's the creepy
damn groundskeeper.

21:15.733 --> 21:17.189
He already told me l was in trouble.

21:17.277 --> 21:18.813
And he said that nobody could help me.

21:18.903 --> 21:21.770
[HALE] Shhh. All right.
Relax, little mama.

21:21.865 --> 21:24.652
[KENZI] Do not call me little!

21:24.742 --> 21:27.484
[HALE] Okay. All right.
Calm down. Stop shaking.

21:27.579 --> 21:30.446
[KENZI] I can't. I'm scared. Have you
seen the guy? God, he's so creepy.

21:30.540 --> 21:33.623
[HALE] Okay, all right.
Come closer, then.

21:33.710 --> 21:35.166
--[KENZ|] Okay.
--[HALE] Stay close.

21:35.253 --> 21:37.790
--[KENZ|] God.
--[HALE] Closer.

21:37.881 --> 21:40.463
No, get closer.

21:40.550 --> 21:45.510
This is not a sexy
undercover moment. God.

21:45.597 --> 21:48.509
No, ma'am. We are all business.

21:50.268 --> 21:53.977
I really hope Bo and Dyson are
getting something useful on their end.

21:54.063 --> 22:01.060
Positive energy. Put it into the world
and it comes back to you tenfold.

22:01.154 --> 22:02.644
That's why I love this place.

22:02.739 --> 22:06.106
You can taste the energy
flowing between all of us.

22:06.201 --> 22:08.157
Isn't that right, dear?

22:12.665 --> 22:14.951
Tastes like success.

22:15.043 --> 22:19.537
And don't worry. Don't worry.
We are very, very discreet.

22:19.631 --> 22:22.498
We... we didn't realize.

22:22.592 --> 22:24.674
Oh, I did.

22:24.761 --> 22:29.676
That interview, coming onto me with
your hubby watching. Fantastic.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.222
--Come on.
--Showing up here tonight

22:31.309 --> 22:36.895
without an invitation...
or a bathing suit.

22:36.981 --> 22:39.142
We knew right away you
were our kind of couple.

22:39.234 --> 22:43.443
Don't be shy. We're not.

22:47.742 --> 22:51.735
Unfortunately, I have an early morning.

22:53.748 --> 22:55.864
Maybe another time.

22:57.585 --> 23:01.874
Right. Another time.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.547
Okay, would you just
spit it out already?

23:12.642 --> 23:15.304
What was your problem tonight?

23:15.395 --> 23:16.430
Just not my scene, okay?

23:16.521 --> 23:19.558
So, you're not a swinger,
Dyson. Big frickin' newsflash.

23:19.649 --> 23:21.731
So, you blow a chance to
get more info on the case?

23:21.818 --> 23:23.900
How do women wear
these friggin' shoes?

23:23.987 --> 23:25.727
Well, I guess we're just going to
have to find a less sleazy way

23:25.822 --> 23:26.982
of getting our information.

23:27.073 --> 23:30.782
Hey! You talk to me.

23:30.868 --> 23:33.154
I don't want to share you, Bo.

23:33.246 --> 23:34.736
--What?
--I don't want anyone else's

23:34.831 --> 23:38.449
hands on your body. I don't
want anyone's mouth on yours.

23:38.543 --> 23:41.000
And I know this is the last thing
you want to hear right now.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.327
Why wouldn't I want to hear that?

23:42.422 --> 23:47.007
Because you're a succubus, Bo. It's
not in your nature to be monogamous.

23:47.093 --> 23:50.176
I am fighting my nature for you.

23:50.263 --> 23:51.844
And I am more than just my species.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.796
And I don't see you out
there running around,

23:53.891 --> 23:57.099
howling at the moon and
chasing rabbits all day.

23:57.186 --> 23:59.973
--That's a good point.
--I know.

24:00.064 --> 24:03.522
Look, I've been through
more relationships than you.

24:03.610 --> 24:07.979
And I know that lying
about who you are

24:08.072 --> 24:12.236
and trying to change the person
you care about never ends well.

24:15.913 --> 24:18.620
I can be intense.

24:18.708 --> 24:25.329
I can be territorial. And god
knows, I can be mule-headed.

24:25.423 --> 24:30.838
But I'm also yours, if you'll have me.

24:30.928 --> 24:37.015
Dyson, you are an idiot. You've
been mine for a very long time.

24:37.101 --> 24:40.764
Well, you better be careful,
'cause wolves mate for life.

24:40.855 --> 24:46.316
Well, you don't scare me and
I am not making any promises.

24:46.402 --> 24:50.190
And I'm not asking for any in return.

24:50.281 --> 24:53.273
--Except one.
--What's that?

24:53.368 --> 24:58.533
We keep talking like
this. We stay honest.

24:58.623 --> 25:01.114
The only chance we have
of making this work

25:01.209 --> 25:04.076
is if there are no secrets between us.

25:06.214 --> 25:07.795
You promise?

25:10.176 --> 25:13.589
No secrets. I promise.

25:13.680 --> 25:17.389
And can I just say, wow?

25:17.475 --> 25:22.219
That is the most amount of
words l have ever heard you say.

25:26.359 --> 25:29.226
--No more words.
--No more words.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.791
Nice threads.

25:47.505 --> 25:50.121
Rules are rules.
No booze before eleven.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.581
I'm not here for a drink.

25:51.676 --> 25:54.634
You look like you could use one.

25:54.721 --> 25:58.430
I'm done, Trick. No more
keeping secrets from Bo.

25:58.516 --> 26:01.633
Either you tell her, or I will. By tonight.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.514
Tell her what?

26:03.604 --> 26:05.560
Everything.

26:16.993 --> 26:18.779
I really wish you hadn't
told me they're swingers.

26:18.870 --> 26:21.953
I can feel everybody checking me
out on the boinkability index.

26:22.039 --> 26:23.995
Oh, relax. They only
boink other members.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.914
Oh, that's great. Well,
then they'll kill me then.

26:26.002 --> 26:28.835
Yeah. Because the file says that the
workers have three strikes against them.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.788
l have two. And I already racked up another
one this morning because I was late.

26:31.883 --> 26:33.339
Kenzi, nobody's going to kill you.

26:33.426 --> 26:35.508
Well, tell that to Neville's cousin.

26:36.596 --> 26:40.805
Well, that is something. Thanks, mate.

26:40.892 --> 26:41.881
Hale?

26:41.976 --> 26:47.266
Yeah. The next year's budget
came down for our department.

26:47.356 --> 26:49.017
Good or bad?

26:49.108 --> 26:50.814
We got a ten percent bump.

26:50.902 --> 26:52.233
Well, that's good, right?

26:52.320 --> 26:59.032
It's weird. Apparently, they used me
as the poster boy for the increase.

26:59.118 --> 27:03.031
Don't play humble.
You love it, Mr. Thornwood.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.532
Like I said, it's weird.

27:04.624 --> 27:06.865
Well, maybe the prosperity
in this place is contagious.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.290
Maybe.

27:08.377 --> 27:10.868
Coffee? More coffee?

27:10.963 --> 27:13.295
So, I asked around and
that woman named Blake,

27:13.382 --> 27:15.213
apparently, she never
checked out yesterday.

27:15.301 --> 27:16.381
Well, maybe she forgot.

27:16.469 --> 27:20.382
Well, Rita in housekeeping claims
that saw Mitch driving Blake's car.

27:20.473 --> 27:23.340
Hale said something else.
You know that file you gave him?

27:23.434 --> 27:24.810
He checked the names and apparently,

27:24.894 --> 27:27.556
the ones with three strikes are
the ones that are disappearing.

27:27.647 --> 27:31.640
Oh, that's fantastic. That proves
my point. I am murder Fae bait.

27:31.734 --> 27:35.727
And when they kill me, I'm
never talking to you ever again.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.437
What do you say we
take a walk around?

27:37.532 --> 27:39.443
I think that's a lovely idea.

27:42.078 --> 27:45.195
Not me. Not me.

27:46.290 --> 27:47.951
Oh, I'm done for.

27:52.922 --> 27:57.791
You know, this would not
be such a horrible life.

27:57.885 --> 27:59.546
It's almost boring.

27:59.637 --> 28:01.673
Boring, huh?

28:07.770 --> 28:10.807
Well, I look forward to you boring
me for a long time to come.

28:10.898 --> 28:12.638
Me, too.

28:17.989 --> 28:19.104
What's that?

28:19.198 --> 28:22.907
It's a lottery ticket. Must have
dropped from somebody's pocket.

28:25.413 --> 28:27.779
Oh, honey.

28:27.874 --> 28:30.616
I think | just won
twenty-five thousand dollars.

28:31.836 --> 28:34.748
What's that thing about the members
becoming suddenly successful?

28:34.839 --> 28:37.376
Yeah, this is all getting really creepy.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.092
Hey!

28:57.945 --> 28:59.321
Don't do that!

28:59.405 --> 29:01.612
I'm sorry. Forgive me?

29:01.699 --> 29:03.109
Did you find anything?

29:03.200 --> 29:05.236
No, not even a scent.

29:15.671 --> 29:19.380
You want to bet Blake came out
this way and never came back?

29:19.467 --> 29:21.833
Look at this.

29:21.928 --> 29:23.589
[DYSON] |t stinks out here.

29:30.061 --> 29:32.143
Oh my god!

29:32.229 --> 29:33.810
Gosh.

29:44.367 --> 29:47.450
What do you want to
make a bet this is Blake?

29:51.666 --> 29:53.247
lt's human remains, all right.

29:53.334 --> 29:55.199
The D.N.A. in your sample
matches the hair strands

29:55.294 --> 29:56.830
Kenzi got from Blake's locker.

29:56.921 --> 30:00.004
And also the sample you got
from the gardener's cousin.

30:00.091 --> 30:03.174
--Lovely.
--I got more.

30:03.260 --> 30:08.971
All sorts of D.N.A. in that stew.
Including trace amounts of Fae.

30:09.058 --> 30:13.222
As in a Fae left some behind
while killing a bunch of humans?

30:13.312 --> 30:15.689
That would be my guess.

30:15.773 --> 30:18.515
Any ID. on the Fae?

30:18.609 --> 30:20.270
Not in our database.

30:20.361 --> 30:23.979
But I mean, come on, how many
Fae volunteer to donate D.N.A., right?

30:24.073 --> 30:27.361
You know, this is getting way too
gross to play it coy anymore.

30:27.451 --> 30:28.566
What do you have in mind?

30:28.661 --> 30:31.448
Well, I've always preferred
the direct approach.

30:31.539 --> 30:34.281
Loved it. She used to be a gymnast.

30:34.375 --> 30:35.865
Hi, Mitch.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.325
Yeah, excuse me. I'm in
the middle of something.

30:37.420 --> 30:40.207
--I'm going to call you back.
--See? I told you he'd be mad.

30:40.297 --> 30:43.039
I am so sorry we ran
out on you last night.

30:43.134 --> 30:44.624
Well, just when the fun was starting.

30:44.719 --> 30:47.756
Well, she'd like to make
it up to you, Mitch.

30:47.847 --> 30:49.303
Oh?

30:56.564 --> 30:59.021
We know that Blake is dead.

30:59.108 --> 31:01.474
And we know that you
and your hot tub buddies

31:01.569 --> 31:03.434
like to get rich from murder.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.611
We just want to know how it all works.

31:05.698 --> 31:08.735
We're not the only ones
who reap the benefits.

31:08.826 --> 31:11.033
Every member gets
something out of it.

31:11.120 --> 31:13.076
--Eve ryone?
--H ow?

31:13.164 --> 31:15.997
I swear, I don't even know.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.371
Tell us.

31:23.466 --> 31:25.002
I don't know how it works.

31:25.092 --> 31:29.051
But I was hand-picked by the
previous director to take charge.

31:29.138 --> 31:33.928
He entrusted me with the secret.

31:34.018 --> 31:35.758
What secret?

31:35.853 --> 31:39.266
Every member of the
club gets ahead in life

31:39.356 --> 31:43.816
in exchange for some of us
performing sacrifices on their behalf.

31:43.903 --> 31:45.359
Human sacrifices?

31:45.446 --> 31:49.985
Yes, human sacrifices.
Now, come on. Don't stop!

31:50.076 --> 31:53.910
Just, how does it all work?

31:53.996 --> 31:57.614
We get our little group together,
you know, and pick a sacrifice.

31:57.708 --> 32:00.245
Like a member of the staff.

32:00.336 --> 32:04.375
And we go out into the woods
and something feeds on them.

32:04.465 --> 32:05.580
What kind of something?

32:05.674 --> 32:08.290
I don't know. Maybe plants.

32:08.385 --> 32:10.250
[BO] All so you can have success.

32:10.346 --> 32:15.136
And I don't know how it works,
but every member reaps the rewards.

32:15.226 --> 32:19.595
And our victims, their deaths,
they benefit the society.

32:19.688 --> 32:22.521
These are illegal immigrants.
They're not even supposed to be here.

32:22.608 --> 32:25.941
Oh, that sounds reasonable.

32:26.028 --> 32:28.895
We only pick the ones
that are incompetent.

32:28.989 --> 32:31.071
Nice management style.

32:33.953 --> 32:35.238
Sounds like Dark Fae to me.

32:35.329 --> 32:38.116
Well, if that's the case, by Fae
law, the only rule it's broken

32:38.207 --> 32:39.822
is exposing itself to humans.

32:39.917 --> 32:41.373
Meaning?

32:41.460 --> 32:46.750
Meaning, it's an infraction for the
Dark to punish. I can't intervene.

32:46.841 --> 32:50.049
But I can make sure this piece
of garbage doesn't remember

32:50.136 --> 32:52.377
the last five years of his life.

32:52.471 --> 32:57.761
Good times are over, Mitch.
You won't even remember them.

32:57.852 --> 33:03.597
Okay, so all I have to do is find
and defeat a mysterious Fae?

33:03.691 --> 33:06.353
--G reat.
--Good luck.

33:08.362 --> 33:11.525
So, there's this Fae and
it's going to eat me. Eat me!

33:11.615 --> 33:15.153
Not if we can find it first.
Any help here, Trick?

33:15.244 --> 33:17.155
Well, if you're dealing
with a forest-dwelling Fae,

33:17.246 --> 33:19.032
it could be any number of species.

33:19.123 --> 33:24.789
Huh. Well, we've got something
that might help with that. Leftovers.

33:24.879 --> 33:29.418
Feeding by-product. Hoping you
might have an opinion or two about it.

33:35.472 --> 33:38.134
Have the club members been on
the receiving end of good fortune?

33:38.225 --> 33:40.716
You're going to say
that's bad, aren't you?

33:48.694 --> 33:51.606
Oh, that's not good at all.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.688
Because we're dealing
with an evil florist?

33:53.782 --> 33:56.273
It's a Land Wight.

33:56.368 --> 33:59.280
It's a nature Fae that lives in
harmony with a piece of land.

33:59.371 --> 34:00.577
A Fae hippie?

34:00.664 --> 34:02.279
[TRICK] More of a shifter.

34:02.374 --> 34:03.955
It can become completely
indistinguishable

34:04.043 --> 34:05.999
from the plants that it takes care of.

34:06.086 --> 34:08.543
Explains why Dyson
couldn't pick up the scent.

34:08.631 --> 34:11.122
It flourishes in an
organic environment,

34:11.217 --> 34:13.549
which is its strength, but
could also be its weakness.

34:13.636 --> 34:15.968
But what does this have to
do with everybody's success?

34:16.055 --> 34:21.095
Well, anything that grows in
this becomes incredibly tasty

34:21.185 --> 34:23.722
and brings prosperity
to anyone who eats it.

34:23.812 --> 34:26.554
[BO] So, this Wight likes to eat people.

34:26.649 --> 34:30.267
It secretes a digestive juice
onto its victim to soften it up.

34:30.361 --> 34:32.977
And then swallows the resulting mass.

34:33.072 --> 34:35.154
And then the product waste
becomes fertilizer for the plants

34:35.241 --> 34:36.902
that live on the Wight's territory.

34:36.992 --> 34:40.985
Wait a minute. This
fertilizer is Fae poop?

34:41.080 --> 34:42.911
Circle of life.

34:47.044 --> 34:48.409
Oh, god.

34:48.504 --> 34:50.870
Yes! This time, it wasn't me
who had to eat the gross thing.

34:50.965 --> 34:52.080
Why did I have to eat that salad?

34:52.174 --> 34:54.631
Hey, you look sharp, okay.
I am still in danger.

34:54.718 --> 34:56.549
You got to kill this Land
Wight before I am the one

34:56.637 --> 34:57.877
pushing up the damn rutabagas.

34:57.972 --> 35:00.759
Okay, so, right. So, who is most likely
to be a Land Wight around here?

35:00.849 --> 35:03.761
Somebody connected to nature.

35:03.852 --> 35:05.808
Using fertilizer.

35:07.648 --> 35:09.513
--Creepy groundskeeper.
--Creepy groundskeeper.

35:09.608 --> 35:12.520
Okay, so you get to the kitchen.

35:12.611 --> 35:13.396
Okay.

35:13.445 --> 35:16.983
And do whatever you can to stop
them from serving any more food.

35:17.074 --> 35:18.405
I'll deal with him.

35:18.492 --> 35:19.242
--You sure?
--Yeah.

35:19.285 --> 35:20.491
--Okay. Be careful.
--Okay. Bye.

35:20.577 --> 35:22.033
Okay.

35:25.958 --> 35:27.323
You are so going down.

35:27.418 --> 35:29.409
Not without a case of indigestion, girl.

35:29.503 --> 35:30.253
What?

35:30.296 --> 35:31.911
And I'll be damn sure
to burn on my way out.

35:32.006 --> 35:33.667
'Cause you're not going to eat me.

35:33.757 --> 35:38.751
Hey, I am not not eating you.
You are not not eating me.

35:38.846 --> 35:41.007
--Huh?
--Because you're the Land Wight?

35:41.098 --> 35:43.885
No. I'm the groundskeeper.
You work for the monster.

35:43.976 --> 35:45.637
Okay, you've got this all wrong, buddy.

35:45.728 --> 35:47.593
Sure, you're part of that sick
group that feeds the rest of us

35:47.688 --> 35:48.973
to whatever makes that garden grow.

35:49.064 --> 35:49.928
How do you know about that?

35:50.024 --> 35:51.730
I've been groundskeeper
for over thirty years.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.853
Nothing natural grows like that.

35:53.944 --> 35:56.777
Especially after people
start disappearing.

35:56.864 --> 35:58.024
I mean, how do you think
everything grows so nice

35:58.115 --> 35:59.480
and we're not allowed
to use herbicides?

35:59.575 --> 36:03.113
Look, I am here trying to figure out
what is happening to those workers.

36:03.203 --> 36:04.704
I am undercover.

36:04.788 --> 36:05.777
YouWe
acop?

36:05.873 --> 36:08.740
I'm here to kill that plant thing
and if it's not you, who is it?

36:08.834 --> 36:10.950
I've been trying to figure
that myself for months now.

36:11.045 --> 36:13.752
Well, who else has a vested
interest in the garden?

36:15.090 --> 36:18.753
Oh god. Oh, no, no, no, no.

36:18.844 --> 36:21.460
No. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
It's the garden, okay.

36:21.555 --> 36:23.967
It's an attack of the mutant
tomatoes or something.

36:24.058 --> 36:26.891
Neville, give us a moment.
What are you doing?

36:26.977 --> 36:29.218
Dude, trust me. Okay. These
are dangerous to the staff.

36:29.313 --> 36:31.975
And do you know what the
hell these grew out of?

36:32.066 --> 36:34.227
I most certainly do.

36:41.742 --> 36:44.484
[KENZI] This is not my day.

36:54.463 --> 36:57.045
Venus... flytrap... mother--

36:57.132 --> 37:00.124
Get your slimy vines off of her,
or I will chop them off.

37:00.219 --> 37:02.460
No human talks to me
like that and lives.

37:02.554 --> 37:03.634
Who's human?

37:03.722 --> 37:06.099
Huh. So, what's your problem, sister?

37:06.183 --> 37:09.050
You're drooling all over my friend here.

37:09.144 --> 37:11.635
And, frankly, eating
people is so low rent.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.971
This is my land. I cultivate it.

37:14.066 --> 37:17.775
The creatures I allow to live
on my plants have great lives.

37:17.861 --> 37:19.397
But I got to eat, too.

37:19.488 --> 37:21.024
Why people?

37:21.115 --> 37:25.154
Because you taste so damn good.

37:25.244 --> 37:26.609
If humans didn't like the deal,
they never should have

37:26.703 --> 37:28.910
developed on my territory.
Their choice.

37:28.997 --> 37:32.660
Hey, except the ones that
you ate never got to choose.

37:32.751 --> 37:35.743
So, this ends as of now.

37:37.047 --> 37:39.538
Oh, you think you can take me?

37:39.633 --> 37:43.967
Try it. Any bruise, any nick, any cut,

37:44.054 --> 37:45.635
it'll grow back like it never happened.

37:45.722 --> 37:51.217
Really? Well, let's see how you
like the taste of herbicide.

37:53.689 --> 37:58.399
Yeah, villagers and pitchforks never
made a good combo, did they?

37:58.485 --> 38:00.567
You're going to be a party to murder?

38:00.654 --> 38:05.148
Actually, no, I'm not. This is
between you and your prey.

38:05.242 --> 38:07.028
Kitchen's all yours.

38:15.919 --> 38:20.458
[AMY screaming]

38:24.720 --> 38:27.302
Yo, this must be the weirdest
thing you guys ever dealt with.

38:27.389 --> 38:32.383
Uh huh. Yeah, definitely the
weirdest thing we have ever seen.

38:32.478 --> 38:35.561
But none of you can tell anyone ever.

38:35.647 --> 38:39.356
Yeah, like, who's going
to believe us, anyway?

38:39.443 --> 38:40.273
What a freakin' nightmare.

38:40.360 --> 38:43.602
I still don't understand
what went down, you know.

38:43.697 --> 38:48.066
Yeah, well, some things are
better off as mysteries, you know.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.900
What am I going to tell
Thumper's parents back home?

38:49.995 --> 38:51.201
What are they going to live on?

38:51.288 --> 38:54.371
They needed every last penny
he was sending back to them.

38:56.043 --> 39:01.333
Well, it's not much consolation,
but give them the money from this.

39:01.423 --> 39:04.506
You're not going to...

39:04.593 --> 39:08.632
...wait another minute to help
this poor man's family, are you?

39:08.722 --> 39:10.428
No, I can't accept this.

39:10.516 --> 39:12.598
Trust me. Those winnings aren't mine.

39:12.684 --> 39:16.142
[KENZI] Take it. Take it.

39:17.523 --> 39:19.514
[NEVILLE] Thank you.

39:19.608 --> 39:21.519
Thanks.

39:21.610 --> 39:23.726
--[HALE] What's it saying?
--Chatter from the Dark community.

39:23.820 --> 39:25.356
Land Wight was killed by humans.

39:25.447 --> 39:27.483
Nobody suspects Bo's involvement.

39:27.574 --> 39:30.566
So, no one will come looking
for revenge. Awesome.

39:30.661 --> 39:33.744
And as we speak, Mitch is
having his memory erased by the

39:33.830 --> 39:35.957
"drunk" in the holding cell next to him.

39:36.041 --> 39:37.406
What about his buddies?

39:37.501 --> 39:42.040
Well, now that the Wight's dead, their
prosperity should take a nosedive.

39:42.130 --> 39:46.464
The faster they rise, the
more devastating the fall.

39:46.552 --> 39:49.669
Better watch your own
fortunes then, Mr. Country Club.

39:49.763 --> 39:51.503
Well, lucky for me,
I barely touched the food.

39:51.598 --> 39:56.308
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, by the way,
the paperwork, it's all yours.

39:56.395 --> 39:57.601
How's that for a start?

39:57.688 --> 40:00.145
Thank you.

40:00.232 --> 40:02.097
Did you talk to Bo?

40:02.192 --> 40:04.979
It wasn't the right time.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.937
For something like this,
there's never a right time.

40:08.031 --> 40:09.612
Dyson, please.

40:11.243 --> 40:12.403
[cell phone ringing]

40:12.494 --> 40:15.531
Why, yes, I could use the
longest, hardest back rub.

40:15.622 --> 40:17.158
[DYSON] We've got to talk.

40:17.249 --> 40:18.238
We're talking.

40:18.333 --> 40:20.039
Not over the phone. It's important.

40:20.127 --> 40:22.960
What, are you still mad
about the polo shirt?

40:23.046 --> 40:26.209
No. Look, I've got to go to the cop
shop to put this thing to bed.

40:26.300 --> 40:27.790
Can I come over after?

40:27.884 --> 40:31.502
Well, as I recall, your office gets
pretty empty this time of night.

40:31.597 --> 40:34.134
Why don't I bring you dinner?

40:34.224 --> 40:35.680
Do you remember
how to let yourself in?

40:35.767 --> 40:41.057
Desk sergeants are like putty in
my hands. I'll see you in a bit.

40:57.539 --> 40:59.154
Can I help you?

40:59.249 --> 41:02.662
Actually, I think I can help you.

41:02.753 --> 41:06.041
I'm the one you've been looking for.

41:06.131 --> 41:09.749
Ahh!

41:10.761 --> 41:16.301
Now, do you know who I am?
Say my name, bitch.

41:28.278 --> 41:30.519
Oh, say my name.

41:30.614 --> 41:32.229
Aife.

41:44.002 --> 41:49.713
Oh, this is embarrassing. You
weren't supposed to see this.

41:51.343 --> 41:54.210
Hey, come on. Stay with me.

41:54.304 --> 41:56.420
You are one hell of a
toxic friend, Saskia.

41:56.515 --> 41:59.848
I was doing you a favour. It's not
like he put up much of a fight.

41:59.935 --> 42:01.550
Try me!

42:05.023 --> 42:09.016
A succubus letting a man own
her ass? Not on my watch.

42:09.111 --> 42:11.898
Come on, sweetie, we'll
be good for each other.

42:18.662 --> 42:22.746
You know, you're really
a hard friend to help.

42:38.557 --> 42:41.594
Come on. Come on, stay
with me, Dyson. Come on.

42:41.685 --> 42:43.346
Stay with me.

42:43.437 --> 42:44.893
Come on.

42:44.980 --> 42:47.096
Oh, I don't know how to do this.

42:52.738 --> 42:54.194
Come on.

42:56.241 --> 43:00.575
Come on, come on.
Stay with me. Come on.

43:07.669 --> 43:09.625
Okay.

43:09.713 --> 43:10.623
Bo!

43:10.714 --> 43:14.172
It's okay. I'm here. It's okay.

43:21.933 --> 43:24.185
Bo, I'm so sorry.

43:24.269 --> 43:25.975
It's okay.

43:26.062 --> 43:29.600
You're okay. You're okay.
