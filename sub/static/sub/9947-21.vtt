WEBVTT

00:00.280 --> 00:00.640
Look, if you don't eat it, right,
then the helicopter will crash.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.639
Anyone watching, thinking
we know fuck all about

00:04.640 --> 00:08.639
knowing fuck all about owt,
needs to watch their back...

00:08.640 --> 00:11.759
So you've had your Labour
reclassifying skunk,

00:11.760 --> 00:13.519
sending prices sky-high,

00:13.520 --> 00:18.039
literally, literally taking
the grass from its own roots!

00:18.040 --> 00:20.239
Now you've got your condemnation,

00:20.240 --> 00:23.639
Liberals noshing Tories like
altar boys picking dimps up!

00:23.640 --> 00:27.479
Have we had a national
fucking stroke... or what?

00:27.480 --> 00:31.319
Is revolution a word
or was it never?

00:31.320 --> 00:33.879
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:33.880 --> 00:37.319
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:37.320 --> 00:40.599
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester

00:40.600 --> 00:43.519
and they charge us for water?!

00:43.520 --> 00:48.719
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:48.720 --> 00:52.519
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times!

00:52.520 --> 00:54.480
Yak, yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak, yak, yak!

00:54.481 --> 00:57.799
It's not theirs any more.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.239
This is our England now.

01:00.240 --> 01:01.959
Paaaarty!

01:09.600 --> 01:13.799
I always felt I was different,
I never believed that I fitted in.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.679
Life is... ordinary,
but I was special.

01:16.680 --> 01:19.959
I used to think, "I'm not
a part of this, I can't be.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.920
"I must be adopted!"

01:24.680 --> 01:27.639
My real mum and dad were film stars.

01:27.640 --> 01:31.319
Yeah, and they couldn't look after
me because of their careers and that,

01:31.320 --> 01:32.360
but one day... one day...

01:32.361 --> 01:34.399
Fish and chips!

01:34.400 --> 01:35.919
They'll come back for me.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.279
My real parents will tip
up in a fuck-off limo

01:38.280 --> 01:40.639
and whisk me off
to a better life...

01:40.640 --> 01:45.159
Excuse me, mister, I really want
to do magic. Can you teach me?

01:45.160 --> 01:47.399
And then I learnt...

01:47.400 --> 01:48.480
Fuck off, kid.

01:48.481 --> 01:51.519
That there's no such thing
as magic or the Tooth Fairy

01:51.520 --> 01:53.079
or Father Christmas.

01:53.080 --> 01:56.279
It's like flying pigs,
they don't exist.

01:56.280 --> 01:58.759
We just have to make
do with what we've got.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.439
Come on, it's good for you.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.199
Look, if you don't eat it, right,

02:04.200 --> 02:07.759
then Mr Cuddles' banana brains will
get splattered all over the wall!

02:07.760 --> 02:10.999
I know how you feel. I can't
do a thing with this today.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.719
It's flat as a gymnast's chest!

02:12.720 --> 02:13.960
Helicopter!

02:15.360 --> 02:20.599
Look, if you don't eat it, right,
then the helicopter will crash.

02:20.600 --> 02:21.720
Let 'em die.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.680
Is there a brew going, or what?

02:26.681 --> 02:28.200
Yeah, in the kettle.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.440
That's mine!

02:32.200 --> 02:33.278
Got your name in it?

02:33.279 --> 02:34.040
Yeah, it has!

02:34.041 --> 02:36.319
Is that porridge? No,

02:36.320 --> 02:37.679
it's a kebab

02:37.680 --> 02:42.119
She prefers Chocky-Choc Pops,
with a bit of sugar on.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.079
Is that what you feed her?

02:44.080 --> 02:46.599
It's no wonder she won't touch it,

02:46.600 --> 02:50.319
she's holding out for a sugar fix.
That stuff will rot her teeth.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.198
They're only her baby ones,
she'll get a new set.

02:52.199 --> 02:53.160
If she gets older!

02:53.161 --> 02:56.559
The shit you're pumping into her!
You're not fit to be a parent.

02:56.560 --> 02:57.440
What, and you are?

02:57.441 --> 02:59.799
Well, I'm more qualified
than you are!

02:59.800 --> 03:00.878
Who's the daddy... I'm
the fucking daddy!

03:00.879 --> 03:02.118
Who's the daddy?!

03:02.119 --> 03:03.038
Where's your fucking tool?

03:03.039 --> 03:04.560
You're a fucking tool!

03:04.561 --> 03:06.880
Pack it in!

03:09.560 --> 03:13.360
It's not about you, or about
how good you are, it's about her!

03:15.840 --> 03:17.320
Smaller spoon.

03:17.321 --> 03:20.119
It's like when you're
feeding a poorly snake,

03:20.120 --> 03:22.120
y'know, you chop up the mice
with the scissors.

03:23.960 --> 03:26.479
Right, you set of lazy bastards!

03:26.480 --> 03:27.680
Morning.

03:27.681 --> 03:29.919
I've got piles of bills here
falling out me arse

03:29.920 --> 03:32.239
and what are you lot doing about it?

03:32.240 --> 03:33.999
Fuck all!

03:34.000 --> 03:37.559
I need every single one
of you worthless shites

03:37.560 --> 03:40.719
to start pulling
in some serious money!

03:40.720 --> 03:42.079
Today!

03:42.080 --> 03:43.638
I'm out there grafting already.

03:43.639 --> 03:46.000
Thought we were going to town?
Get a new trackie?

03:46.001 --> 03:48.519
I've got a golden shower
booked in at ten.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.760
I've got me community service.

03:49.761 --> 03:52.759
Prancing about in tights
in't community service.

03:52.760 --> 03:53.518
Yer what?

03:53.519 --> 03:55.518
I picked up needles
and shit when I did it.

03:55.519 --> 03:56.960
Him? Doing drama, plays and that.

03:56.961 --> 04:00.479
Maybe the magistrate saw
something in me.

04:00.480 --> 04:04.239
What, like big fucking gayness?

04:04.240 --> 04:05.920
You're not me dad!

04:10.680 --> 04:13.439
So I reckon the magistrate
was knocked out by me.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.559
Saw that I had a bit
of something about me.

04:15.560 --> 04:17.560
Bastard, you bastard,
you fucking bastard.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.079
Cos I've done loads of acting, me.

04:19.079 --> 04:20.640
See how you like that!

04:20.641 --> 04:22.079
I was the Inn Keeper.

04:22.079 --> 04:26.519
Well, I played an opportunistic
businessman in a historical drama.

04:26.520 --> 04:27.599
- huh.

04:27.600 --> 04:31.079
And we made a film, Taxi Driver,
it was fucking mint.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.559
I mean it was mint. Soz.

04:33.560 --> 04:37.039
I just really want to make
a success out of this,

04:37.040 --> 04:40.079
I think I'm turning
a corner, you know.

04:40.080 --> 04:43.319
Yeah, if I can just get this
sentence out of the way...

04:43.320 --> 04:44.520
Bastard!

04:44.521 --> 04:46.159
Good news?

04:46.160 --> 04:47.360
It's my ex,

04:47.361 --> 04:49.439
ran off with my best friend!

04:49.440 --> 04:52.039
You really missing her?

04:52.040 --> 04:54.439
I'll get his knees done if you want?

04:54.440 --> 04:57.119
Get him put in a wheelchair
and that...

04:57.120 --> 04:59.199
Joke!

04:59.200 --> 05:02.999
No, I know what it's like to
be in an abusive relationship.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.880
Me step-dad nicks
my clothes, right.

05:04.881 --> 05:08.200
He's using one of my t-shirts
to sleep in!

05:10.280 --> 05:14.399
And he hits me,
I mean, like, proper hits me.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.760
He's cracked a few
of me ribs and that.

05:15.761 --> 05:17.800
In here.

05:19.000 --> 05:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:30.240 --> 05:33.079
I think there's been a mistake.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.120
You shouldn't have called
the magistrate a "fucking mong".

05:35.121 --> 05:36.519
He was a fucking mong.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.639
He'd had a stroke.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.320
And?

05:46.840 --> 05:49.160
Dropped down dead
from a brain tumour.

05:49.161 --> 05:51.679
Age? 57.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.599
Here's another good one.

05:53.600 --> 05:58.119
Father of two, 47,
knocked down by a bus, 47.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.039
Morbid old crones.

06:00.040 --> 06:04.159
They make Goth Dave look like
a children's television presenter.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.759
Two halves of cider, one with black.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.360
That's the one with black.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.840
Can I have some cash
for the pool table?

06:18.480 --> 06:19.120
Cheers.

06:19.121 --> 06:21.799
He acts like a child,
but then again he is, isn't he?

06:21.800 --> 06:23.758
Shouldn't you get him
a lemonade too?

06:23.759 --> 06:25.560
Or does the sugar make him hyper?

06:25.561 --> 06:27.839
Careful what you say now.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.039
There are children about

06:30.040 --> 06:32.520
and we don't want them picking up
any bad language now, do we?

06:34.720 --> 06:35.600
Mummy?

06:37.600 --> 06:39.558
Can I have a bag of crisps, please?

06:46.120 --> 06:48.200
You need to man-up!

06:50.400 --> 06:54.479
"That, my... dear young friend,

06:54.480 --> 06:57.679
"is the... theory

06:57.680 --> 07:01.159
"that the corrupt French...

07:01.160 --> 07:05.920
"drama has been propounding..."

07:07.120 --> 07:08.840
Aw, you've been smoking!

07:14.120 --> 07:16.999
This will be a million
times better than

07:17.000 --> 07:18.798
the shit you're inhaling
there, brother.

07:18.799 --> 07:20.040
It's Salford Skunk.

07:20.041 --> 07:22.039
Shop local, like it.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.718
Thai Stick.

07:23.719 --> 07:25.640
Pure quality.

07:25.641 --> 07:29.919
I'm autistic so it focuses
me mind and it's good for...

07:29.920 --> 07:31.840
concentration.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.039
D'you like it here?

07:36.040 --> 07:40.239
S'all right, usually a bit better
when we haven't got The Thrush.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.359
Irritating twat.

07:42.360 --> 07:46.439
And to be honest, I prefer
numbers to words, me, anyway.

07:46.440 --> 07:47.960
For example...

07:49.560 --> 07:51.879
from here, I can see...

07:51.880 --> 07:54.519
80 trees, 72 yellow lines,

07:54.520 --> 07:56.719
412 railings,

07:56.720 --> 08:00.999
17 traffic lights, 12 satellite
dishes, 3 cameras, 64 windows,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.120
24 cars, and two dead pigeons.

08:05.040 --> 08:07.079
You know all that
just by looking at them?

08:07.080 --> 08:08.639
The other thing I like is...

08:08.640 --> 08:10.359
Never mind that!

08:10.360 --> 08:11.878
D'ya fancy going
to a casino one night?

08:11.879 --> 08:13.840
The other thing I like is women.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.599
I want to shag a woman.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.639
I bet you've shagged loads of women.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.000
What's it like?

08:21.280 --> 08:22.240
Messy.

08:23.320 --> 08:24.959
Anyway, fuck that!

08:24.960 --> 08:28.999
Look... d'ya want to come to
the casino one night with me?

08:29.000 --> 08:31.719
Put in some serious money?

08:31.720 --> 08:34.200
Get me a woman to shag
and I'll come to the casino.

08:44.280 --> 08:48.319
The community service dickheads
proudly present...

08:48.320 --> 08:50.439
Litter Pick on the M60.

08:50.440 --> 08:54.439
We're a cutting-edge group, right,
with important things to say.

08:54.440 --> 08:55.759
So have I.

08:55.760 --> 08:57.239
Get a fuckin' job!

08:59.200 --> 09:00.879
I'll show ya.

09:00.880 --> 09:01.959
Show me.

09:01.960 --> 09:04.759
You think I'm a joke,
you think I'm worth fuck all.

09:04.760 --> 09:09.600
It's not just me, Mickey. It's
pretty much across the board, mate.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.159
Kel...

09:13.160 --> 09:15.560
Fancy making a million quid for Mam?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.959
Boom!

09:19.960 --> 09:21.200
What the fuck are you playing at?

09:21.201 --> 09:22.759
Duh!

09:22.760 --> 09:24.678
You'll be wearing that internally.

09:24.679 --> 09:26.560
I've got a list of jobs
as long as me arse,

09:26.561 --> 09:28.399
and you piss off out of here!

09:28.400 --> 09:30.079
I was manning up, like you wanted.

09:30.080 --> 09:33.039
Leave you at home doing the jobs,
and me come here, like a man.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.879
You tell 'er, kid.

09:34.880 --> 09:38.199
It's not how it works ...
not in my house.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.879
Your list of jobs.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.759
It's about time you proved
yourself to be a man...

09:43.760 --> 09:45.038
my man ... all right?!

09:45.039 --> 09:46.120
Winner stays on!

09:46.121 --> 09:47.679
Now!

09:53.040 --> 09:54.160
Ha-ha-ha!

09:54.161 --> 09:57.599
As for your conduct
towards Miss Cardew,

09:57.600 --> 09:59.639
I must say that your...

10:01.160 --> 10:04.359
simple, innocent girl like that...

10:04.360 --> 10:05.680
Do you like this?

10:05.681 --> 10:08.839
Excuse me. Chatting away
while people are working

10:08.840 --> 10:10.118
is hugely disrespectful.

10:11.481 --> 10:13.799
You got something to say?

10:13.800 --> 10:15.759
Why are they doing this?

10:15.760 --> 10:17.200
Did they choose it?

10:17.201 --> 10:19.879
No disrespect or 'owt, but...

10:19.880 --> 10:23.759
I don't understand it. By the
looks of it, neither do this lot.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.839
I'm sick and tired of men
telling me what's what.

10:26.840 --> 10:30.599
Time and time again, they think
they know best, and they know

10:30.600 --> 10:33.799
f... jack all!

10:33.800 --> 10:36.679
You, Michael Maguire,
have yourself a one-way ticket

10:36.680 --> 10:39.639
right out of here, direct to prison.

10:39.640 --> 10:43.239
Do not pass go and
do not collect £200!

10:43.240 --> 10:44.078
Wait!

10:44.079 --> 10:46.398
I'm telling the courts
you're in breach of your order.

10:46.399 --> 10:47.880
All right, I'm sorry...

10:47.881 --> 10:51.239
Contributed nothing,
except negativity,

10:51.240 --> 10:53.919
whipping them up into a frenzy!

10:53.920 --> 10:56.439
There won't be a revolution here!

10:56.440 --> 10:57.759
Please!

10:57.760 --> 10:59.159
Not on my watch!

10:59.160 --> 11:01.480
Miss? Miss, wait!

11:13.680 --> 11:15.279
She pushed me!

11:15.280 --> 11:16.080
She fell.

11:16.081 --> 11:17.160
Pushed.

11:21.480 --> 11:22.760
Please! Let me out!

11:29.960 --> 11:31.519
Success.

11:31.520 --> 11:34.199
I picked up the child allowance
from the post office,

11:34.200 --> 11:36.879
went to court, paid the fines,

11:36.880 --> 11:39.359
dropped the wash off
and did the shop.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.360
Who's this?

11:45.240 --> 11:46.759
It's the same pram!

11:56.480 --> 11:58.999
Flat-out asleep.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.040
Cilla or Latifah?

12:00.041 --> 12:01.159
Cilla.

12:01.160 --> 12:03.279
Look, I've proved I can do stuff,

12:03.280 --> 12:05.479
shown I can sort problems ...
I've manned up.

12:05.480 --> 12:07.240
But can you think for yourself?

12:07.241 --> 12:10.759
I don't know what you want me to say.
Yeah! Yeah, I can think for myself.

12:10.760 --> 12:11.680
And pigs won't fly.

12:11.681 --> 12:12.679
I can!

12:12.680 --> 12:14.879
Prove it.

12:14.880 --> 12:17.120
We've got to find 500 quid
before midnight.

12:17.121 --> 12:18.399
Have we?

12:18.400 --> 12:20.719
It's a hypothetical case.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.159
Right.

12:22.160 --> 12:24.158
So where are you
going to get it from?

12:24.159 --> 12:25.120
The bank?

12:25.121 --> 12:27.118
You haven't got a bank account.

12:27.119 --> 12:28.200
Hypothetical bank?

12:28.201 --> 12:30.559
For fuck's sake, Mickey!

12:30.560 --> 12:32.439
Billy.

12:32.440 --> 12:35.679
You can't get it from the bank,
not from any of our stashes,

12:35.680 --> 12:38.519
sell anything or hurt anybody.

12:38.520 --> 12:43.039
So where are you going
to get 500 quid from... tonight?

12:43.040 --> 12:44.120
Think.

12:50.920 --> 12:53.319
My mum used to work in this office.

12:53.320 --> 12:56.399
It had a box of petty cash...

12:56.400 --> 12:57.560
500 quid's worth?

12:57.561 --> 12:59.640
More like a grand.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.200
I don't have to get it, do I?

13:19.080 --> 13:23.359
I like lemonade and sara-cong...

13:23.360 --> 13:26.479
Come on, please.

13:26.480 --> 13:28.759
She fancies you.

13:28.760 --> 13:32.479
But I fancy her, right?

13:32.480 --> 13:33.960
So stay away!

13:33.961 --> 13:35.640
All right.

13:37.960 --> 13:39.840
Hiya.

13:43.201 --> 13:45.199
Right...

13:45.200 --> 13:48.120
Ten-minute fag break.

13:52.640 --> 13:55.559
I know they're a bit different
to how I described 'em...

13:55.560 --> 13:57.959
I'm used to it,
I do different every day.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.080
This is it.

14:00.560 --> 14:01.558
Are you Mickey's girlfriend?

14:01.559 --> 14:02.680
No!

14:02.681 --> 14:06.360
No, she's just here to help out,
you know, erm, lend a hand.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.080
You can have a brew, then.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.280
Are you all right to use the kettle?
I mean, you're allowed?

14:17.920 --> 14:21.440
So, where's this Rain Man who's
going to make us some serious money?

14:27.640 --> 14:31.679
What play will we do instead?

14:31.680 --> 14:33.599
It's one I'm writing myself.

14:33.600 --> 14:37.959
It's the story of a poor,
misunderstood genius,

14:37.960 --> 14:39.560
rejected by everyone around him.

14:39.561 --> 14:41.479
He wants to fit in,

14:41.480 --> 14:43.679
he strives for it,

14:43.680 --> 14:45.120
but...

14:46.360 --> 14:47.800
no-one gets him.

14:49.280 --> 14:50.959
You lot know what it's like.

14:50.960 --> 14:53.479
Feeling like you don't fit in?

14:53.480 --> 14:55.039
We do fit in.

14:55.040 --> 14:57.520
But what about when people
call you names and that?

14:57.521 --> 14:58.839
Names?

14:58.840 --> 15:02.599
Yeah...
Window-lickers, biffs, retards.

15:02.600 --> 15:06.719
People don't call me
names like that.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.000
What do they call you, then?

15:08.001 --> 15:09.479
Terry.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.758
What play would you like to do?

15:13.759 --> 15:14.558
Mamma Mia!

15:14.559 --> 15:15.678
Marley & Me!

15:15.679 --> 15:16.640
Avatar!

15:16.641 --> 15:18.399
They're all films, not plays.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.760
Stuart Little?

15:19.761 --> 15:25.159
I saw a play once, it were in
German, think it was about a lesbian

15:25.160 --> 15:27.799
trying to hang a curtain
over a broken window.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.200
Lasted three hours.
It were fucking brilliant.

15:30.201 --> 15:31.679
We're not doing that.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.319
What do you think we should do?

15:34.320 --> 15:37.000
What was the last play you saw?

15:39.120 --> 15:40.440
Nativity?

15:42.400 --> 15:45.239
What d'you have to say that for?

15:45.240 --> 15:47.519
Christmas is ages away!

15:47.520 --> 15:50.759
That was the last play I saw. It was
the last play I was in at school.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.799
I was the innkeeper.

15:52.800 --> 15:55.360
Were you any good?

16:02.880 --> 16:04.799
Go on.

16:04.800 --> 16:08.119
Go on!

16:08.120 --> 16:10.000
I was...

16:11.240 --> 16:13.040
brilliant.

16:14.560 --> 16:15.840
Just gonna go for a slash.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.960
Whoa! What d'ya want?
What're you doing?!

16:28.800 --> 16:31.600
Not what I want,
what I can give you.

16:31.601 --> 16:34.600
The best suck-off you've ever had.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.080
All right...

16:44.400 --> 16:45.759
stud?

16:45.760 --> 16:46.880
Wait, listen.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.518
Whoa Whoa, you don't want me!

16:50.519 --> 16:52.080
Yeah, I do.

16:52.081 --> 16:53.799
Just get off, will ya!

16:53.800 --> 16:55.280
I don't care if it's little.

16:56.600 --> 17:00.319
It's like a baby's arm
holding an apple, right?

17:00.320 --> 17:02.639
Un-hard. Stop!

17:02.640 --> 17:03.840
You want to do it here?

17:03.841 --> 17:05.439
Right now?

17:05.440 --> 17:06.319
Casino first.

17:06.320 --> 17:10.039
Then we'll do whatever you want...

17:10.040 --> 17:11.760
sugar lips.

17:17.280 --> 17:18.480
Don't you fancy me?

17:18.481 --> 17:20.359
No.

17:24.160 --> 17:25.358
I do.

17:25.359 --> 17:28.439
You'd let me suck you off
if you really thought I was pretty.

17:28.440 --> 17:29.600
You are pretty!

17:29.601 --> 17:31.120
It's just...

17:32.320 --> 17:35.039
I'm not the right man
for you, Lise.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.160
I'm no good.

17:37.840 --> 17:40.879
I'm useless.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.120
'Waste of space.

17:42.121 --> 17:43.839
'Lazy, pathetic, pointless.'

17:43.840 --> 17:45.679
Never amount to anything.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.160
What are you for, Mickey?

17:47.161 --> 17:49.360
What the fuck are you for?

17:53.640 --> 17:59.599
You need someone that won't let you
down, someone who's dependable.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.240
A real man like...

18:02.680 --> 18:04.039
like Terry.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.439
Terry?!

18:05.440 --> 18:06.959
Big time.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.479
I've seen the way
he looks at you and that.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.679
He'd look after you as well.

18:11.680 --> 18:16.239
Y'know, he's a real man, a protector.

18:16.240 --> 18:19.879
He'd pick you up,

18:19.880 --> 18:21.320
in his arms.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.720
And everyone would watch
as he carried you...

18:27.960 --> 18:31.039
in his big, strong arms.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.599
With your head leant
against his chest,

18:33.600 --> 18:35.599
his rock-hard ripped and cut chest,

18:35.600 --> 18:39.840
pecs like stone,
nipples like wheelnuts.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.959
The heat of him,
his breath on your face,

18:43.960 --> 18:46.759
his heart beating
through his solid chest,

18:46.760 --> 18:48.279
as he holds you tight,

18:48.280 --> 18:52.840
being held close and tight.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.240
So, you're gay.

18:59.040 --> 19:03.319
Look, wait!
Don't say owt, will you?

19:03.320 --> 19:04.800
Keep it between the two of us?

19:07.120 --> 19:08.640
Your secret's safe with me.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.279
We won't say a word either.

19:14.280 --> 19:19.000
I won't, as long as you don't tell
anyone I've got Downs Syndrome.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.160
Deal.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.519
Been years since I did a burglary.

19:40.520 --> 19:43.040
We all used to do it together,
me, Paddy, the kids.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.680
Proper family stuff.

19:45.681 --> 19:47.599
Happy days.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.559
It was always a
bit of a turn-on for me.

19:50.560 --> 19:54.800
I'm getting a bit of a wide-on now.
Job first, though. Come on.

19:59.080 --> 20:00.879
We all have skills, right?

20:00.880 --> 20:03.639
I'm great on post codes.
Name a place.

20:03.640 --> 20:05.199
Go on, test me.
Test me!

20:05.200 --> 20:07.599
Chester Zoo?

20:07.600 --> 20:08.640
CH2.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.639
Blackpool Pleasure Beach?!

20:10.640 --> 20:12.159
FY4.

20:12.160 --> 20:14.279
Brilliant!
Buckingham Palace?!

20:14.280 --> 20:16.079
Yeah, all right! Fuckin' 'ell!

20:16.080 --> 20:19.239
I know every word to Gladiator,
but it won't make us a million.

20:19.240 --> 20:20.919
SW1 1AA.

20:21.561 --> 20:22.879
Sorry.

20:22.880 --> 20:26.199
Number boy's skills, however,
are a different kettle of fish.

20:26.200 --> 20:28.479
A kettle of fish?

20:28.480 --> 20:30.559
Limo. Casino.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.039
Let's go to work.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.080
Hit me!

22:06.920 --> 22:09.519
He's fucking useless!
Lost every fucking penny!

22:09.520 --> 22:11.480
He told me he was great with numbers!

22:11.481 --> 22:14.759
0808 157 2020.

22:14.760 --> 22:15.880
Pizza delivery!

22:15.881 --> 22:18.279
I'm on about cards, Raymond!
Fucking cards!

22:18.280 --> 22:20.118
You can't even count
to 21, you prick!

22:20.119 --> 22:21.398
Hit me!

22:21.399 --> 22:22.560
Don't tempt me!

22:22.561 --> 22:26.359
What was all that
"400 windows, 70 doors" bollocks?!

22:26.360 --> 22:28.518
Every day I have a smoke
out the back and I...

22:28.519 --> 22:29.758
Count it all.

22:29.759 --> 22:31.320
Stops me getting bored.

22:32.400 --> 22:33.560
Can we have sex now?

22:33.561 --> 22:35.319
Unbelievable.

22:35.320 --> 22:40.199
I believe there was a
rehearsal here last night.

22:40.200 --> 22:43.839
A rehearsal without
an appropriate leader, I.e. you!

22:43.840 --> 22:46.039
We went to the casino.

22:46.040 --> 22:50.959
Well, there won't be any more
rehearsals, not now, not ever.

22:50.960 --> 22:55.199
The building is closed
until further notice.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.679
You can't do that.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.159
Can, and have.

22:59.160 --> 23:02.120
And what's it got to do
with the talking sex doll?

23:03.240 --> 23:05.799
You can't shut the building!

23:05.800 --> 23:07.080
I can and I have.

23:07.081 --> 23:08.960
Health and safety.

23:11.360 --> 23:15.399
If Lise continues to insist that
she didn't push me down the stairs,

23:15.400 --> 23:18.519
then I must have slipped
and the building closes

23:18.520 --> 23:23.719
until the Health and Safety
Executives have investigated.

23:23.720 --> 23:25.840
Thank you! Mum?

23:27.480 --> 23:29.359
And don't forget,

23:29.360 --> 23:34.359
no play, no community service!

23:34.360 --> 23:37.720
Bye-bye, outside,
hello, Strangeways.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.959
You've no sense of
a dramatic exit, have you?

23:43.960 --> 23:44.920
Brake's stuck, sorry.

23:44.921 --> 23:45.960
Here y'are.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.639
I'd walk away from them if I could,
the play and everything,

23:55.640 --> 23:57.839
if it meant I weren't
walking towards prison.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.120
Thanks a lot.

23:59.121 --> 24:00.919
No offence,

24:00.920 --> 24:05.319
it's just we've got a few rivals
inside at the moment, y'know.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.080
Wouldn't be much of a holiday for me.

24:07.081 --> 24:09.519
I could tell them I pushed her.

24:09.520 --> 24:10.398
No.

24:10.399 --> 24:12.200
She'd let us back into the building.

24:12.201 --> 24:13.879
She won't, she's an evil bitch.

24:13.880 --> 24:15.118
That must be destroyed!

24:15.119 --> 24:16.400
Steady on.

24:16.401 --> 24:17.879
Sorry.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.918
We can find somewhere
else for the play.

24:19.919 --> 24:21.838
And keep Mickey out of Sing Sing.

24:21.839 --> 24:23.080
Where?

24:23.081 --> 24:26.279
You two are all over each other
like a tic on a tramp's vest.

24:26.280 --> 24:27.759
What's the secret?

24:27.760 --> 24:30.679
We've discovered
the secret to happiness.

24:30.680 --> 24:33.639
White wine and Night Nurse?

24:33.640 --> 24:35.598
Doing something together
we both enjoy.

24:35.599 --> 24:36.758
D'you fancy doing it again?

24:36.759 --> 24:37.800
Tonight?

24:40.960 --> 24:43.238
You know I'm only using the play
as a ruse, right?

24:43.239 --> 24:44.280
Yeah? Yeah.

24:44.281 --> 24:46.479
I'm training 'em up, aren't I?

24:46.480 --> 24:48.519
Think about it.

24:48.520 --> 24:51.319
They'll be
the best drug dealers in the world.

24:51.320 --> 24:52.759
Methodical, practical.

24:52.760 --> 24:55.639
They won't use the produce
and the best thing is,

24:55.640 --> 24:57.279
the filth won't suspect them.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.920
Look at 'em.

25:00.840 --> 25:04.279
What the fuck's this?
Attack of the...

25:04.280 --> 25:06.359
Bollocks! You smelly old tramp.

25:06.360 --> 25:10.479
It's time we started
standing up for ourselves.

25:10.480 --> 25:11.560
Fucking set of...

25:14.280 --> 25:16.239
Before you say owt,

25:16.240 --> 25:18.599
I know they're going to kill me,
one day.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.240
It's not you I'm worried about,
it's your baby.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.320
Your baby doesn't have a choice.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.879
I'm not pregnant, sweetheart!

25:28.880 --> 25:32.719
Trapped wind
and a little bit of heartburn.

25:32.720 --> 25:34.319
Always going to the toilet.

25:34.320 --> 25:35.680
You're having a baby.

25:37.480 --> 25:38.879
Great news!

25:38.880 --> 25:40.320
Great news.

25:41.440 --> 25:44.479
Jamie has said that we can rehearse
and put the show on in here,

25:44.480 --> 25:46.879
providing...

25:46.880 --> 25:49.200
you lot run a few errands for him.

25:51.360 --> 25:52.400
£10 each, yeah?

25:52.401 --> 25:54.959
And we'll invite a few heads
from the council,

25:54.960 --> 25:56.879
see if we can get a bit of funding

25:56.880 --> 26:01.440
and then we can open our very own
centre right here in the Chatsworth!

26:04.640 --> 26:05.840
Or somewhere else?

26:05.841 --> 26:08.280
Yeah!

26:09.640 --> 26:12.119
Now come on,
you little band of biffers!

26:12.120 --> 26:14.159
You wanker! Fuck off, wanker!

26:14.160 --> 26:16.200
Cock off!

26:22.240 --> 26:23.840
Do you think this is gonna work?

26:23.841 --> 26:25.359
It has to.

26:25.360 --> 26:28.279
Not just for me freedom,
but also...

26:28.280 --> 26:31.480
to show those snide fuckers round
here, always taking the piss.

26:50.840 --> 26:52.839
Are you sure about this?

26:52.840 --> 26:54.879
Yes!

26:54.880 --> 26:56.919
But in the Bible,

26:56.920 --> 26:59.599
Joseph didn't saw anyone in half.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.639
It's artistic license.

27:01.640 --> 27:05.319
It doesn't say that he didn't
saw anyone in half.

27:05.320 --> 27:09.719
And he was a joiner,
so he'd have had saws and shit,

27:09.720 --> 27:11.839
and maybe a bit of curiosity.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.560
Trust me!

27:15.920 --> 27:17.840
It's a boy.

27:19.840 --> 27:22.039
I'm not pregnant.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.919
The ring never lies.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.000
It's a boy.

27:26.360 --> 27:28.239
My husband is infertile.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.359
Funny.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.440
But if you've only been having
sex with your husband...

27:46.040 --> 27:49.320
Guess this isn't just about
the paint on my carpet?

27:53.320 --> 27:56.039
Want a bit of help, sweetheart?

27:56.040 --> 27:57.800
Cost you.

27:59.240 --> 28:01.518
What happened to the milk of human
kindness?

28:01.519 --> 28:02.920
Turned to cheese.

28:02.921 --> 28:05.399
20 quid an hour ... all the help
you need.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.840
One part white spirit
and two parts water...

28:07.841 --> 28:09.600
shift that in next to no time.

28:20.440 --> 28:24.559
OK, I'm not a big believer in
miracles, especially not round here,

28:24.560 --> 28:27.200
so we can rule out another immaculate
conception...

28:28.600 --> 28:30.400
and Shane's infertile.

28:33.480 --> 28:35.680
It's Marty.

28:38.640 --> 28:41.159
You never go bareback!

28:41.160 --> 28:43.120
It wasn't business.
It was more than that.

28:43.121 --> 28:45.039
Are you sure?

28:45.040 --> 28:48.119
What happens when it all turns
to shit?

28:48.120 --> 28:50.559
What am I gonna do?

28:50.560 --> 28:52.519
We can sort this, yeah.

28:52.520 --> 28:55.559
I'm not getting rid of it.
This is all we've...

28:55.560 --> 29:01.039
Me and Shane, it's all we've
ever wanted and...

29:05.120 --> 29:06.520
I can't tell him.

29:06.521 --> 29:10.079
Well, you're gonna have to tell
him something.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.719
I can't!

29:11.720 --> 29:14.400
He's gonna find out sooner or later.

29:44.840 --> 29:47.439
Watch yourself, Rain Man!

29:47.440 --> 29:49.319
What do you think?

29:49.320 --> 29:50.240
Perfect!

29:55.960 --> 29:57.279
What?

29:57.280 --> 29:59.839
Why don't you just talk to Terry?

29:59.840 --> 30:01.839
I know he likes you.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.679
It's not that easy.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.280
It was all right for you to barge in
to the bogs and offer me a gob-job!

30:05.281 --> 30:07.479
That was just sex.

30:07.480 --> 30:09.319
It's different with Terry.

30:09.320 --> 30:10.800
I don't know what I feel.

30:13.160 --> 30:16.440
Sometimes it's hard to tell someone
what's really going on.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.599
Hey, I've been ringing you.

30:20.600 --> 30:23.759
Right. Sorry, my phone's been
on silent for rehearsals.

30:23.760 --> 30:25.038
Have you finished?

30:25.039 --> 30:26.360
We've only just started.

30:26.361 --> 30:29.359
I've got a job. You gonna be all
right? I can't take her with me.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.119
It's too dangerous.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.400
She can be the baby Jesus.

30:41.400 --> 30:42.919
My only concern now

30:42.920 --> 30:45.799
is getting a crowd in to see it ...
an audience, you know.

30:45.800 --> 30:48.399
I mean, who's going to want
to come and see this lot

30:48.400 --> 30:51.239
do the Nativity when it's not
even Christmas?

30:51.240 --> 30:53.159
Why can't it be Christmas?

30:53.160 --> 30:56.160
Tills are always bursting.
I love Christmas!

31:16.840 --> 31:19.239
I'm sorry! You all right?

31:19.240 --> 31:20.879
I've twisted me knee!

31:20.880 --> 31:23.039
It needs support.

31:23.040 --> 31:25.000
I need a bandage.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.479
I'm sorry!

31:40.480 --> 31:42.800
Will it be OK?

31:46.560 --> 31:48.159
"It hasn't got an alarm."

31:48.160 --> 31:50.959
But instead, it's got a private
security company

31:50.960 --> 31:52.679
with a direct link to the filth.

31:52.680 --> 31:54.079
Perfect!

31:54.080 --> 31:55.520
They'll send me down for this!

31:55.521 --> 31:56.759
Grow up.

31:56.760 --> 31:58.560
I can't go to prison. I'm too young!

31:58.561 --> 32:01.679
We'll get our brief on to it,
be away on some technicality.

32:01.680 --> 32:02.959
Don't worry!

32:02.960 --> 32:04.360
What if we don't?

32:04.361 --> 32:08.600
I'll pack you some lube.
Pretty boy like you.

32:17.400 --> 32:19.600
Dozy bastard.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.038
We should've gone back to the car.

32:39.039 --> 32:40.320
He would have seen us.

32:40.321 --> 32:42.639
Ring Shane or someone.

32:42.640 --> 32:44.920
Ask them to pick us up.
Where's your phone?

32:44.921 --> 32:46.839
In the car.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.479
Where's your phone?

32:48.480 --> 32:50.200
In the car.

32:52.320 --> 32:54.479
Fuck! What are we gonna do?

32:54.480 --> 32:55.960
I dunno.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.359
Paddy'd know what to do.

32:59.360 --> 33:01.479
He would. One clever fuck that one,

33:01.480 --> 33:05.559
great under pressure ... always
thinking on his feet, you know.

33:05.560 --> 33:06.960
Well, that's the answer!

33:06.961 --> 33:09.480
Do a fucking seance and ask Paddy
what to do!

33:15.280 --> 33:16.560
Sorry.

33:18.480 --> 33:19.680
Nah, I'm sorry.

33:21.400 --> 33:26.239
Right, we can't get a cab, we can't
hitch a lift, not with these, so...

33:26.240 --> 33:27.679
We'll walk.

33:27.680 --> 33:30.519
We can't, it's too risky.
Filth are looking for us.

33:30.520 --> 33:33.280
We need somewhere to lay low
till morning.

33:46.760 --> 33:48.959
We shouldn't be doing this.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.479
It's a church.

33:50.480 --> 33:51.959
Hardly.

33:51.960 --> 33:53.799
It's one of God's houses.

33:53.800 --> 33:56.679
Hasn't paid his council tax
by looks of it.

33:56.680 --> 33:57.760
That's blasphemous!

33:57.761 --> 34:01.759
What, it's all right to break into
offices and nick stuff,

34:01.760 --> 34:04.679
but it's not all right to
walk into an unlocked church?!

34:04.680 --> 34:07.199
I've got morals.

34:07.200 --> 34:11.478
Doesn't look like it's in use
now anyway. Come on.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.039
What are you doing?

34:13.040 --> 34:14.239
Looking.

34:14.241 --> 34:15.478
For what?

34:15.480 --> 34:17.799
A saw or something to get these off.

34:17.800 --> 34:20.918
Yeah, always get a saw
in a church.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.918
Drink this. It's the blood of Christ.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.279
This is his body...

34:24.280 --> 34:26.119
This is his saw.

34:26.120 --> 34:28.839
What then? Since you think you're
the brains of the outfit!

34:28.840 --> 34:30.118
I am the brains of the outfit!

34:30.119 --> 34:31.480
What am I then?

34:31.481 --> 34:34.478
A piece of meat? A fuck machine?!

34:34.480 --> 34:36.279
Have a bit of respect.

34:36.280 --> 34:38.478
Swearing in a place of worship!

34:38.480 --> 34:40.600
I don't give a shit.

34:42.040 --> 34:43.199
Hang on...

34:48.040 --> 34:49.760
Thank you, God.

34:55.600 --> 34:57.759
Copper chopper.

34:57.760 --> 34:59.839
Pigs will fly.

34:59.840 --> 35:01.479
Come on, hurry up!

35:01.480 --> 35:02.680
I'm going as fast as I can.

35:02.681 --> 35:04.039
We'll be here forever!

35:04.040 --> 35:06.480
It'd go quicker if I sawed
through your wrist.

35:06.481 --> 35:08.479
You're going to hell, you.

35:08.480 --> 35:09.760
What, and you're not?

35:09.761 --> 35:13.719
I pray, I repent,
I go to confession.

35:13.720 --> 35:16.839
I don't get why you
believe in all that shit.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.840
After everything I've been through?

35:25.680 --> 35:28.919
I have to believe my dead children
are in a better place,

35:28.920 --> 35:31.239
because if I thought this was it,

35:31.240 --> 35:35.320
that life was just this,
with nothing at the end...

35:37.600 --> 35:38.960
then I'd just give up.

35:50.120 --> 35:55.119
Maybe you need to start
looking at "this"

35:55.120 --> 35:56.400
a bit differently.

35:56.401 --> 35:58.239
That was then.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.040
This is now.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.960
You, me and Cilla.

36:31.560 --> 36:34.080
Kinda liked having you by me side.

36:36.760 --> 36:38.920
Maybe we should make it
more permanent.

36:38.921 --> 36:40.319
You having a laugh?

36:40.320 --> 36:42.960
No. Will you marry me?

37:09.360 --> 37:11.399
Everyone all right?

37:11.400 --> 37:12.719
How are you doing?

37:12.720 --> 37:13.880
Nervous?

37:15.200 --> 37:16.558
I've still not had a shag!

37:16.559 --> 37:18.520
Who the fuck are you supposed to be?

37:18.521 --> 37:21.639
Inn keeper.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.639
I've still not shagged a woman yet.

37:23.640 --> 37:25.439
What's with all the blue paint?

37:25.440 --> 37:28.240
I get it,
it's fucking Avatar, in't it?

37:29.480 --> 37:30.680
Avatar inn keeper!

37:30.681 --> 37:32.160
But there's...

37:33.880 --> 37:34.960
Never mind.

37:36.240 --> 37:39.919
Terry, I wanted a word with you
about the last scene.

37:39.920 --> 37:44.879
I know we've not rehearsed it, but
Joseph should kiss Mary at the end.

37:44.880 --> 37:46.840
It's Lise's idea.

37:51.080 --> 37:54.840
But in the Bible Mary
and Joseph don't kiss.

37:57.160 --> 38:00.279
But it doesn't say
they didn't either.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.719
They probably did a lot
more besides kissing.

38:02.720 --> 38:04.839
You're up the duff
and it's not your husbands,

38:04.840 --> 38:08.559
you'll have to do more than kissing
to make him sweet, aren't you?

38:08.560 --> 38:10.120
You know what I mean.

38:11.280 --> 38:13.079
Think about it.

38:13.080 --> 38:15.839
Mary's giving Joseph a blow-job?

38:15.840 --> 38:17.559
Well, no! Not in our play.

38:17.560 --> 38:20.720
Maybe after, who knows?
But just a kiss for now?

38:23.640 --> 38:25.440
Never mind.

38:30.640 --> 38:33.919
Lise? I've just had a chat with Terry

38:33.920 --> 38:38.639
and he's come up with this great idea
that Mary and Joseph kiss at the end.

38:38.640 --> 38:40.760
All his idea.

38:45.960 --> 38:47.239
Like a dream.

38:47.240 --> 38:50.919
Call an ambulance! He's passed out.

38:50.920 --> 38:52.439
It must've been the paint!

38:52.440 --> 38:55.679
Don't worry Mickey, leave him to us.

38:55.680 --> 38:57.479
Fucking hell, Ches. Come on.

38:57.480 --> 39:00.799
You'll need a new inn keeper
now, Mickey.

39:00.800 --> 39:04.239
He's not gonna be up to doing the
show. What are you gonna do?

39:04.240 --> 39:05.840
Michael Maguire?

39:07.160 --> 39:07.878
Depends.

39:07.879 --> 39:09.640
We spoke earlier...
I'm from the council.

39:09.641 --> 39:11.399
Brilliant! Innit?

39:11.400 --> 39:12.719
Yeah... Great!

39:12.720 --> 39:16.519
We're so chuffed you could come,
you'll see what this group have done

39:16.520 --> 39:19.199
and maybe bung 'em some cash
to get their own centre.

39:19.200 --> 39:22.519
I'm the Health and Safety Executive.
There'll be no performance

39:22.520 --> 39:25.079
on these premises.
The set has to be fire-proofed,

39:25.080 --> 39:29.479
there are no fire exit signs
displayed, a risk of overcrowding.

39:29.480 --> 39:32.279
But this lot have got
a performance in less than an hour!

39:32.280 --> 39:33.880
Well, you have to cancel.

39:35.120 --> 39:38.479
Notification of intention
to prosecute if you fail to abide.

39:38.480 --> 39:40.320
Cancel.

39:41.400 --> 39:44.919
That's that then.
No stage, no inn keeper...

39:44.920 --> 39:46.480
no show.

39:51.960 --> 39:55.759
I've not worked my bollocks
off for nothing.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.800
We are doing it.

40:12.960 --> 40:16.559
Bugger off, can't you see
it's the second coming?

40:16.560 --> 40:19.320
Stupid, what are you doing? Hey! Hey!

40:22.640 --> 40:28.759
All of the hotels,
and the pubs are all full.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.759
Man United must be playing!

40:31.760 --> 40:36.760
This is the last inn for miles.

40:55.560 --> 40:57.399
Hello.

40:57.400 --> 41:01.319
My wife is with child.

41:01.320 --> 41:04.199
We need a bed for the night.

41:04.200 --> 41:09.680
Do you have room at your inn?

41:21.160 --> 41:22.280
Go on.

41:29.320 --> 41:33.080
Do you have room at your inn?

41:35.920 --> 41:37.840
Go on.

41:40.200 --> 41:42.640
We haven't got any room, I'm sorry.

41:44.960 --> 41:45.800
Gutted.

41:48.600 --> 41:50.720
I tell you what, though.

41:53.760 --> 41:57.239
We've got a, sort of,
stable round there.

41:57.240 --> 41:59.160
You can have that if you want?

42:00.680 --> 42:01.880
Thank you, sir.

42:01.881 --> 42:04.879
Thank you for your kindness.

42:04.880 --> 42:06.120
Nice one.

42:23.321 --> 42:25.639
I've already told you,
we haven't got any room.

42:25.640 --> 42:26.920
The bizzies are after us.

42:26.921 --> 42:28.600
Get in.

42:35.440 --> 42:38.040
Will you marry me?

42:50.240 --> 42:54.559
It's like squeezing a bowling ball
through the eye of a fucking needle!

42:54.560 --> 42:56.360
Hardly.

43:04.960 --> 43:06.960
I'm not going to the hospital
till I've got a shag!

43:06.961 --> 43:08.959
Don't look at me.

43:08.960 --> 43:10.480
Or me.

43:39.520 --> 43:42.679
'There is magic everywhere.
But only if you believe.

43:42.680 --> 43:46.599
'That's what people say, innit?
You know they type of people.

43:46.600 --> 43:49.239
'They go on about star signs,
angels and shit.

43:49.240 --> 43:52.879
'You have DVD box sets of Friends
and they cry at greeting cards.

43:52.880 --> 43:55.319
'But they're usually single.

43:55.320 --> 43:58.159
'You won't find magic with a bunch
of weekend hippies

43:58.160 --> 44:00.320
'at Glastonbury
squatting on lay-lines.

44:00.321 --> 44:02.479
Yeah, they've all got
tattoos and crystals.'

44:07.520 --> 44:10.719
'If you want real magic you
go to Creamfields with a spliff,

44:10.720 --> 44:14.599
'a bag of pills in one hand
a bag of mushrooms in the other.'

44:28.560 --> 44:31.519
That was all right, that.
For a dickhead.

44:31.520 --> 44:36.679
'The real secret is,
you have to work hard for magic.

44:36.680 --> 44:38.839
'It's not handed to you on a plate.'

44:38.840 --> 44:40.278
Mickey Maguire?

44:40.279 --> 44:42.040
'The universe
don't give a flying fuck

44:42.041 --> 44:44.200
'about your pissy
little existence.'

44:46.480 --> 44:47.919
Mam!

44:54.960 --> 44:58.759
'Close the book, stop chanting,
ringing your bells

44:58.760 --> 45:02.599
'and open your eyes. You want magic?
Make it fucking happen, then!'

45:10.920 --> 45:13.759
Billy Tutton is doing me
the honour of making me his wife.

45:13.760 --> 45:16.679
A match made in Jeremy Kyle
ratings heaven.

45:16.680 --> 45:17.400
I didn't get rid of it.

45:17.401 --> 45:18.839
Shane loves kids.

45:18.840 --> 45:20.558
I've moved on.

45:20.559 --> 45:21.600
Are you going to him?

45:22.840 --> 45:24.560
There is no-one.

45:24.561 --> 45:26.519
Pack whatever you've accumulated

45:26.520 --> 45:28.679
and fuck off away from our mum.

45:28.680 --> 45:31.239
If you want to get rid of me,
you'll have to do it your way.

45:31.240 --> 45:33.200
Grab him!

45:34.320 --> 45:36.640
You'll learn to love me again,
I know you will.

46:22.840 --> 46:25.560
And you put the egg in like so.

46:26.600 --> 46:29.639
Then we say the magic words.

46:29.640 --> 46:31.720
Fish and chippingtons!

46:34.840 --> 46:37.280
With a bit of luck...

46:39.440 --> 46:42.439
It's not worked, but... you know.

46:42.440 --> 46:44.040
You have a go.
