WEBVTT

00:03.436 --> 00:05.233
Human fascination with water
is amazing.

00:05.405 --> 00:08.340
We're constantly going
to beaches, pools, lakes, rivers.

00:08.508 --> 00:11.477
We're swimming, we're snorkeling,
we're scuba-diving.

00:11.644 --> 00:14.078
We bathe in it.
Our bodies are mostly made of water.

00:14.247 --> 00:16.579
Everyone's carrying around
these bottles of water.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.047
We can't get enough water.

00:18.218 --> 00:19.412
Unless it rains...

00:19.586 --> 00:21.713
...then we're like,
"Oh, look, I'm soaked.

00:23.056 --> 00:25.524
I am literally drenched."

00:26.126 --> 00:30.756
For some reason, we have a huge
problem with small, flying water.

00:30.930 --> 00:32.955
It'll just stop us right in our tracks.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.894
"I felt a drop.

00:36.736 --> 00:38.966
We're gonna get caught in it!

00:39.139 --> 00:42.540
Everyone cover
your water bottles. Run!"

00:47.247 --> 00:48.646
Get off at the next exit.

00:48.815 --> 00:50.942
Kramer, I've driven
to East Hampton many times.

00:51.117 --> 00:52.311
I know the exit.

00:52.485 --> 00:54.350
I hear it's a great house.
Pool, sun deck.

00:54.521 --> 00:55.681
Yeah, I'll be there.

00:55.855 --> 00:57.482
You sure we're making
the right move?

00:57.657 --> 01:00.922
We gotta see the new baby. At least
we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons.

01:01.094 --> 01:03.528
-Didn't they just have a baby?
-That was two years ago.

01:03.696 --> 01:06.324
Remember?
"Jerry, you gotta see the baby.

01:06.499 --> 01:09.900
You gotta see the baby."

01:10.070 --> 01:13.631
Is it possible they're just having
babies to get people to visit them?

01:14.374 --> 01:16.740
Hey, Jerry, you ever
wear silk underwear?

01:18.845 --> 01:21.405
-No.
-Put that on the top of your list.

01:21.581 --> 01:24.516
No, not for me.
A little too delightful.

01:25.051 --> 01:26.848
George and Jane
should be almost there.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.885
Isn't it weird that they
haven't had sex...

01:29.055 --> 01:30.920
...but they're spending
a weekend together?

01:31.091 --> 01:33.753
George is pleased.
It's like she signed a letter of intent.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.259
-When's Rachel coming out?
-The 3:00 train.

01:36.429 --> 01:37.691
Her father is so religious.

01:37.864 --> 01:39.957
I'm amazed he's letting you
see her again...

01:40.133 --> 01:42.931
...after that <i>Schindler's List</i>
make-out session.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.866
I brought him some kishke.

01:45.038 --> 01:46.972
-What's that?
-It's a stuffed meat thing.

01:47.140 --> 01:50.234
Israeli soldiers carry it in case
they're captured behind enemy lines.

01:50.410 --> 01:52.435
They eat it and it kills them.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.914
I never tasted a cough medicine
I didn't love.

01:59.085 --> 02:01.747
Me too. I love cough medicine.

02:01.921 --> 02:04.685
You see? We were made
for each other.

02:05.091 --> 02:08.389
<i>It's amazing. If I reach out
and touch her breast right now...</i>

02:08.561 --> 02:10.654
<i>... she'd scream and throw me
out of the car.</i>

02:10.830 --> 02:14.266
<i>But at this time tomorrow,
I could touch it all I want.</i>

02:14.467 --> 02:16.958
-What's your favorite?
-Pertussin.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.071
-Ever try it with club soda?
-No.

02:19.239 --> 02:21.571
Oh, very refreshing.

02:22.375 --> 02:24.172
<i>Sex is like joining a private club.</i>

02:24.344 --> 02:25.743
<i>I'll be the same me tomorrow...</i>

02:25.912 --> 02:29.040
<i>... but suddenly the "no trespassing"
sign will be gone.</i>

02:29.415 --> 02:32.350
-Are we almost there?
-Yeah, about 10, 15 minutes.

02:32.519 --> 02:34.248
But I have to stop
at a vegetable stand.

02:34.420 --> 02:37.287
-What for?
-My mother loves Hampton tomatoes.

02:37.457 --> 02:40.051
She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.191
Can you buy them later?

02:42.362 --> 02:45.058
I really wanna get some sun.

02:46.699 --> 02:49.827
Hey, Jerry, rub some lotion
on my back.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.665
Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?

02:52.839 --> 02:54.204
Come on. I'll rub some on you.

02:54.374 --> 02:57.639
-That's not sweetening the deal.
-Oh, come on.

02:57.810 --> 02:58.868
No.

02:59.045 --> 03:00.672
You know, when I was a kid...

03:00.847 --> 03:04.476
...I once found $1.50 in change
at the bottom of a pool.

03:04.651 --> 03:07.211
-You must have been excited.
-Yeah.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.884
I gotta go get those tomatoes.
You wanna go?

03:10.056 --> 03:14.425
-I don't think so.
-Okay. I'll see you later.

03:15.495 --> 03:18.293
-Anybody want some tomatoes?
-No, thanks.

03:18.464 --> 03:21.433
I'm gonna take a dip.

03:24.070 --> 03:25.935
And then there's Maude.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.532
Look at my face.
Look at it.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.302
-Do you see any lines?
-No lines.

03:31.477 --> 03:34.605
You know why?
One word: Shade.

03:34.781 --> 03:37.750
So when are we gonna see this baby?
When is this momentous event?

03:37.917 --> 03:39.612
He's taking a nap or something.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.411
I'm gonna go see if there are
any girls on the beach.

03:42.589 --> 03:44.648
-Elaine, you wanna come?
-No, thanks.

03:44.824 --> 03:46.917
I got plenty of girlfriends.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.757
Well, this is interesting.

03:52.932 --> 03:54.194
What?

03:54.367 --> 03:57.336
Jane's topless.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.168
Yo-Yo Ma.

04:01.774 --> 04:05.107
Boutros Boutros-Golly.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.579
Nice rack.

04:08.748 --> 04:12.514
Come on, you guys.
You can come and see the baby now.

04:12.685 --> 04:16.553
-Oh, in a minute, Carol.
-Yeah, we're gonna be right up.

04:16.723 --> 04:19.589
This is weird, wild stuff.

04:20.059 --> 04:22.459
George hasn't even seen her yet.

04:22.629 --> 04:24.756
Why do you think we're getting
the sneak preview?

04:24.931 --> 04:27.627
Maybe she's trying to create a buzz.

04:28.868 --> 04:32.634
-What?
-Get some good word of mouth going.

04:33.806 --> 04:35.933
Oh, here she comes.

04:38.745 --> 04:41.213
I'm thirsty. Anyone want a drink?

04:46.486 --> 04:48.113
No, thanks.

04:48.655 --> 04:50.054
I'm good.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:59.732 --> 05:02.860
All right. Show's over.
I'm going to the beach.

05:07.140 --> 05:11.042
Adam, Jerry and Elaine are here.

05:11.244 --> 05:14.645
Where is the cute little
snuggly baby?

05:14.814 --> 05:17.374
-Isn't he gorgeous?
-Oh, he's...

05:20.687 --> 05:23.315
Is he gorgeous.

05:27.593 --> 05:29.652
Gorgeous, yes.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.558
So very gorgeous.

05:31.764 --> 05:34.392
Michael, shut the door.
You're letting bugs in.

06:12.872 --> 06:18.742
Is it me or was that the ugliest baby
you have ever seen?

06:20.012 --> 06:21.070
I couldn't look.

06:21.280 --> 06:24.374
It was like a Pekingese.

06:25.551 --> 06:28.748
Boy, a little too much chlorine
in that gene pool.

06:29.622 --> 06:32.716
The thing is, they'll never know.
No one's ever gonna tell them.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.360
-You have to lie.
-Oh, it's a must-lie situation.

06:35.528 --> 06:37.826
Yes. It's a must-lie situation.

06:37.997 --> 06:41.262
You know, I don't think we should
tell George we saw Jane topless.

06:41.467 --> 06:44.231
No. I don't think so.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.735
Remind me to tell Kramer too.

06:50.977 --> 06:52.911
Lobster.

06:57.817 --> 07:00.911
-Well, this ointment should do it.
-How are you feeling, Adam?

07:01.387 --> 07:05.721
Elaine. This is our pediatrician,
Ben Pfeffer.

07:08.694 --> 07:10.355
Hi.

07:10.630 --> 07:13.428
Look at him, Elaine.
How gorgeous is he, I ask you?

07:13.599 --> 07:15.430
How gorgeous?

07:15.601 --> 07:17.933
Pretty gorgeous.

07:18.104 --> 07:22.234
-Elaine, do you have children?
-Me? No, but I'd love to have a baby.

07:22.408 --> 07:26.310
I mean, I can't wait to have a baby.
I'm just dying to have a baby.

07:26.946 --> 07:30.211
A beautiful woman like you should.
You're quite breathtaking.

07:32.552 --> 07:34.247
Breathtaking?

07:34.454 --> 07:36.888
I'm breathtaking?

07:37.056 --> 07:38.956
And he's very particular.

07:39.158 --> 07:42.252
Ben, you're staying
over tonight, right?

07:42.428 --> 07:44.020
Sure.

07:47.066 --> 07:48.499
I...

07:48.901 --> 07:50.766
I'm gonna go pick up Rachel
at the station.

07:50.937 --> 07:52.837
-Yeah, see you.
-Okay.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.734
Oh, just look at him.

07:56.909 --> 07:59.571
Yeah, he really is breathtaking.

08:06.919 --> 08:09.683
The train was so crowded,
I had a seat facing the wrong way.

08:09.856 --> 08:12.552
Oh, I like that.
It's like going back in time.

08:13.559 --> 08:15.186
-Hey, Rachel.
-Hi.

08:15.361 --> 08:18.330
-I'm gonna go in and get changed.
-Okay.

08:21.934 --> 08:23.424
What kind of a greeting was that?

08:23.603 --> 08:26.299
-She's got greeting problems.
-Yeah.

08:26.772 --> 08:28.603
Boy, I love these Hampton tomatoes.

08:28.774 --> 08:31.004
You know, you can eat them
like apples.

08:31.177 --> 08:34.010
It's funny. The tomato never really
took off as a hand fruit.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.578
Well, the tomato's an anomaly.

08:35.748 --> 08:37.807
So successful with the ketchup
and the sauce...

08:37.984 --> 08:39.451
...but you can't find a good one.

08:41.153 --> 08:42.881
Look at what I got!

08:46.192 --> 08:47.318
The K-man!

08:47.493 --> 08:49.051
You got lobster for everybody?

08:49.228 --> 08:52.595
Yeah, and they're fresh.
Right out of the ocean!

08:52.765 --> 08:54.995
This is fantastic.
Man, what a weekend!

08:55.167 --> 08:56.896
Swimming, lobster for dinner.

08:57.069 --> 08:58.559
I know. It's great.

08:58.738 --> 09:01.036
I saw Jane topless.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.285
You saw who what?

09:15.454 --> 09:18.890
Yeah, I saw Jane topless.
Well, we all saw her.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.285
All right.

09:23.462 --> 09:25.396
You saw Jane topless?

09:26.065 --> 09:30.001
Well, when you went for the
tomatoes, she lied out topless.

09:30.169 --> 09:32.865
Oh, you mean facedown
on her chest.

09:33.039 --> 09:34.666
No.

09:35.942 --> 09:38.775
-Faceup on her back?
-Yeah.

09:38.945 --> 09:42.312
-Well, why'd she do that?
-Well, I guess she was hot.

09:43.215 --> 09:45.240
You mean she just
lay there topless?

09:45.418 --> 09:47.181
No, no. She got up,
she walked around.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.945
Walked around?

09:50.122 --> 09:51.817
-And you looked?
-Of course.

09:51.991 --> 09:53.424
She's got a great body, buddy.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.756
All right, I'm gonna go upstairs.
I'll be right back.

09:56.996 --> 10:00.625
I can't believe that you saw her
before me!

10:00.800 --> 10:03.360
Think of me as a doctor.

10:04.337 --> 10:08.740
-Well, how good a look did you get?
-What do you mean?

10:08.908 --> 10:11.240
Well, if she was a criminal...

10:11.410 --> 10:15.107
...and you had to describe her
to a police sketch artist..?

10:15.615 --> 10:17.480
They'd pick her up
in about 10 minutes.

10:20.519 --> 10:21.918
Great. Great.

10:22.088 --> 10:25.023
So any time you want,
you can just visualize her naked.

10:26.092 --> 10:27.616
I guess that's true.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.852
Stop it. Stop it.

10:30.029 --> 10:31.462
This is not fair! It's not fair.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.496
I don't like this.
I don't like it one bit.

10:33.666 --> 10:36.066
What do you want me to do?
You wanna see Rachel naked?

10:36.235 --> 10:38.533
Yes! Yes!

10:38.704 --> 10:42.003
-Yeah, right.
-The punishment should fit the crime.

10:42.174 --> 10:44.574
You could see me naked.
I could offer you that.

10:45.244 --> 10:46.836
It's like I'm Neil Armstrong.

10:47.013 --> 10:51.074
I turn around for a sip of Tang
and you jump out first!

10:54.420 --> 10:56.581
Nobody ever called me
breathtaking before.

10:56.756 --> 10:59.281
I've never been called
breathtaking either.

10:59.825 --> 11:03.022
I mean, if he thinks that
that baby is breathtaking...

11:03.229 --> 11:04.958
...then who's not breathtaking?

11:05.131 --> 11:07.691
Maybe he just said it
because the mother was in the room.

11:07.867 --> 11:10.301
Yeah. Right.
That's a possibility.

11:10.469 --> 11:11.868
I have to find out.

11:12.038 --> 11:14.666
-How you gonna do that?
-I can be very clever.

11:14.840 --> 11:18.071
-I'm gonna take a swim.
-Oh, me too. I'll meet you down there.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.737
Don't go in.
Rachel's getting undressed.

11:20.913 --> 11:22.642
Oh, okay.

11:25.551 --> 11:28.520
-Hey!
-Oh, sorry.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.521
-Don't you knock?
-I'm sorry.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.989
Not like I'll see something
I've never seen before.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.354
-You might have.
-I didn't.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.052
You won't.

11:38.164 --> 11:39.722
What do you want anyway, George?

11:39.899 --> 11:43.596
Yes, George. I'm kind of
wondering myself.

11:43.769 --> 11:46.033
What is it that you want?

11:46.205 --> 11:50.574
No, I was just wondering
if you guys had any gum.

11:52.645 --> 11:55.170
So you were swimming
in the pool...

11:55.347 --> 11:57.577
...and you wanted some gum.

11:57.750 --> 12:00.810
Yes, because the water
was cold...

12:00.986 --> 12:03.682
...and the chewing warms me up.

12:05.624 --> 12:07.592
We don't have any gum.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.228
Okay. Thanks anyway.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.259
Strange man.

12:14.433 --> 12:16.594
Wait till you get to know him.

12:17.336 --> 12:20.169
-So where is this baby, anyway?
-Oh, check it out.

12:20.339 --> 12:23.172
I guarantee you've never seen
anything quite so objectionable.

12:24.477 --> 12:27.640
It's down the hall,
third door on your left.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.177
Oh, my God!

12:36.355 --> 12:38.983
I'm sorry, I thought this was
the baby's room.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.518
I'm really sorry.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.665
I was in the pool!

12:47.833 --> 12:50.233
I was in the pool!

12:57.042 --> 12:58.339
Did she do it on purpose?

12:58.511 --> 13:01.378
It was my fault.
I told her the wrong door.

13:01.647 --> 13:04.480
I was supposed to see her.
She wasn't supposed to see me.

13:04.884 --> 13:06.044
So what?

13:06.619 --> 13:10.715
Well, ordinarily I wouldn't mind.
But...

13:11.023 --> 13:12.149
But what?

13:13.659 --> 13:17.390
Well, I'd just got back
from swimming in the pool...

13:17.563 --> 13:18.996
...and the water was cold.

13:21.567 --> 13:24.229
-You mean shrinkage.
-Yes.

13:25.838 --> 13:27.430
Significant shrinkage.

13:27.606 --> 13:29.437
So you feel you were shortchanged?

13:29.608 --> 13:31.075
Yes.

13:31.243 --> 13:34.212
If she thinks that's me, she's under
a complete misapprehension.

13:34.380 --> 13:36.245
That was not me, Jerry.
That was not me.

13:36.415 --> 13:38.246
Well, so, what's the difference?

13:38.417 --> 13:41.875
-What if she discusses it with Jane?
-Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.

13:42.054 --> 13:43.885
-How do you know?
-Women aren't like us.

13:44.056 --> 13:46.047
They're worse!
They're much worse than us.

13:46.225 --> 13:48.386
They talk about everything.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.552
Could you tell her about
the shrinkage factor?

13:50.729 --> 13:52.856
No. I'm not gonna tell her
about your shrinkage.

13:53.032 --> 13:55.592
Besides, I think women know
about shrinkage.

13:55.768 --> 13:57.395
How do women know
about shrinkage?

13:57.570 --> 13:59.629
Isn't it common knowledge?

13:59.805 --> 14:00.999
-Elaine.
-Elaine.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.697
Elaine!

14:04.643 --> 14:07.874
-What?
-Do women know about shrinkage?

14:08.047 --> 14:09.605
What do you mean, like laundry?

14:10.616 --> 14:11.605
No.

14:11.784 --> 14:15.845
Like when a man goes swimming,
afterwards...

14:17.790 --> 14:19.587
It shrinks?

14:21.694 --> 14:24.254
Like a frightened turtle.

14:29.635 --> 14:33.332
-Why does it shrink?
-It just does.

14:34.773 --> 14:37.867
I don't know how you guys
walk around with those things.

14:40.946 --> 14:43.938
-Excellent lobster, Kramer.
-Really good.

14:44.450 --> 14:46.247
Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?

14:46.418 --> 14:48.545
No, I can't.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.916
I'm kosher. We don't eat shellfish.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.615
You mean you've
never tasted lobster?

14:53.826 --> 14:55.088
No.

14:55.995 --> 14:58.589
You're so pious.

14:58.764 --> 15:00.322
I really respect that.

15:00.499 --> 15:01.727
You know, when you die...

15:01.901 --> 15:04.199
...you're gonna get
some special attention.

15:06.438 --> 15:08.906
The baby's crying.
I'll go get him, he can sit with us.

15:09.074 --> 15:12.009
No, no. You don't want to do that.

15:12.177 --> 15:14.236
-You'll be uncomfortable.
-Yeah. Finish eating.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.472
The baby's not gonna have
any fun over here.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.549
-We're not fun for a baby.
-Yeah.

15:18.717 --> 15:20.344
The lobsters will scare him.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.389
I'm gonna get him.

15:26.225 --> 15:28.659
See? Look at this.

15:29.695 --> 15:32.892
Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk.

15:33.065 --> 15:36.193
It used to be much bigger,
and now it shrunk.

15:37.002 --> 15:39.061
See, that's what water does.

15:39.238 --> 15:41.297
It shrinks things.

15:41.473 --> 15:45.239
Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science.

15:48.180 --> 15:50.546
What are you doing?
What are you laughing at?

15:50.716 --> 15:53.810
-It's nothing, George.
-It's very impolite to tell secrets.

15:53.986 --> 15:56.819
-Are you talking about me?
-What is it with you?

15:57.523 --> 15:59.548
Easy, big fella.

15:59.925 --> 16:01.790
Kramer, where did you
get these lobsters?

16:01.961 --> 16:05.624
-At MacLeish's Fish Market?
-No. I got them in the ocean.

16:06.098 --> 16:07.827
The ocean? What do you mean?

16:08.000 --> 16:11.561
Well, I found this rope
and I kept tugging on it...

16:11.737 --> 16:13.398
...all these lobsters came up.

16:14.506 --> 16:17.669
Those are commercial lobster traps.
You can't take lobsters from there.

16:17.843 --> 16:19.936
-That's against the law.
-Hey, take it easy.

16:20.112 --> 16:22.580
There are plenty of lobsters
in the ocean for everyone.

16:23.248 --> 16:25.341
My father was a lobsterman.

16:25.551 --> 16:27.314
He got up every morning at 4...

16:27.486 --> 16:29.579
...and came home at night
stinking of brine.

16:29.855 --> 16:32.722
He sent me through law school
with the lobsters he caught.

16:32.891 --> 16:35.724
Here he is.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.300
-Some night, huh?
-Yeah.

16:50.476 --> 16:52.535
I wish I had my telescope.

16:53.012 --> 16:56.345
-Some dinner, huh?
-Yeah.

16:56.515 --> 16:59.075
Nothing like really
fresh-caught lobster.

16:59.251 --> 17:01.242
Some house, huh?

17:02.421 --> 17:04.252
It was built by Mark Farbman.

17:04.455 --> 17:06.549
He built a lot of these homes here.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.325
Some ugly baby, huh?

17:11.663 --> 17:14.461
-What did you say?
-I said...

17:14.633 --> 17:18.762
..."some snuggly baby."

17:20.606 --> 17:22.436
He is something.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.570
Well, to tell you the truth,
Dr. Pfeffer...

17:25.743 --> 17:29.680
...I was surprised to hear you use
a word like "breathtaking"...

17:29.848 --> 17:31.543
...to describe a baby.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.948
I mean, because you also
used it referring to me.

17:36.188 --> 17:40.784
Well, you know, Elaine, sometimes
you say a thing like that just to be nice.

17:45.097 --> 17:46.894
You told her?

17:47.066 --> 17:50.092
-Yeah. What's the big deal?
-You don't understand this organ.

17:50.269 --> 17:52.863
It's very schizophrenic.

17:53.172 --> 17:54.571
Anyway, what's the difference?

17:54.740 --> 17:57.300
You're the ones who are
obsessed with this stuff, not us.

17:57.476 --> 17:59.239
I'm sure it wouldn't matter to Jane.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.777
You're going back
to New York now?

18:01.947 --> 18:05.246
Yeah. I have some things
to do tomorrow.

18:08.053 --> 18:11.147
I think you spoke to your little friend
Rachel, that's what I think.

18:11.356 --> 18:12.823
So what if I did?

18:12.991 --> 18:16.483
And she didn't say something to you
about a certain something?

18:16.662 --> 18:18.357
I don't know what
you're talking about.

18:18.530 --> 18:20.361
I think that you think...

18:20.532 --> 18:23.092
...that a certain something
is not all that it could be...

18:23.268 --> 18:27.034
...when, in fact, it is
all that it should be and more.

18:27.706 --> 18:30.903
-I'm sure it is.
-Look, you don't understand.

18:31.076 --> 18:32.703
There was shrinkage.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.478
You looking for this?

18:45.124 --> 18:48.252
Oh, Kramer. You startled me.

18:48.427 --> 18:52.830
Well, I thought you might
wind up around here.

18:52.998 --> 18:55.330
Yeah, well, I couldn't stop...

18:55.501 --> 18:58.800
...thinking about the way everybody
was enjoying the lobster so much.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.769
And, well, I thought a little taste
couldn't hurt.

19:01.940 --> 19:05.068
-May I?
-No, I'm afraid I couldn't do that.

19:06.245 --> 19:09.874
-Why not?
-Well, now, it wouldn't be kosher.

19:10.916 --> 19:12.713
Come on, Kramer.
I really wanna try it.

19:12.885 --> 19:15.649
No, I'm sorry, honey.
Not on my watch.

19:17.856 --> 19:19.551
Come on, Kramer.

19:23.428 --> 19:25.555
I just heard a car drive out.
What was that?

19:25.731 --> 19:28.791
Oh, just Jane driving back
to New York in the middle of the night.

19:32.938 --> 19:36.999
George, thanks so much
for making breakfast.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.269
These are the best
scrambled eggs ever.

19:39.444 --> 19:40.741
I didn't know you could cook.

19:40.913 --> 19:44.371
Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude
to our gracious host.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.848
Yes, George, the whole breakfast
is breathtaking.

19:50.956 --> 19:52.981
-Good morning.
-Hey!

19:53.158 --> 19:54.921
-Hey, morning.
-Morning.

19:55.093 --> 19:57.994
Kramer, I wanna thank you
again for last night.

19:58.163 --> 20:00.529
-You really saved me.
-What happened?

20:00.799 --> 20:03.461
Well, I almost tried the lobster...

20:03.635 --> 20:04.932
...but Kramer stopped me.

20:05.103 --> 20:08.072
Well, I knew you'd regret it
for the rest of your life.

20:08.273 --> 20:09.968
You're right. I would have.

20:10.142 --> 20:11.973
Hey, look at this guy.

20:12.144 --> 20:14.078
-A little breakfast?
-Yeah.

20:14.246 --> 20:16.544
-And you eat eggs, don't you?
-Yes, I do.

20:16.715 --> 20:19.513
-All right.
-Thank you.

20:20.819 --> 20:23.413
Delicious. Where did you learn
to make eggs like this?

20:23.822 --> 20:26.120
These are so good.

20:26.291 --> 20:27.918
Enjoying them?

20:28.093 --> 20:29.583
Oh, good.

20:30.996 --> 20:36.161
You know, you might wanna try
eating it with one of these.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.704
There's lobster in these eggs?

20:39.871 --> 20:40.963
Not that much.

20:41.139 --> 20:43.664
You know, they tend
to shrink in the water.

20:46.011 --> 20:48.479
Well, I guess I gotta go too.

20:49.314 --> 20:52.772
Well, this has turned out
to be one hell of a weekend.

20:53.652 --> 20:55.882
Excuse me.

20:58.590 --> 20:59.648
Sorry to bother you.

20:59.825 --> 21:02.020
We're trying to track down
a lobster poacher...

21:02.194 --> 21:03.923
...that cleaned out one of the traps.

21:04.162 --> 21:05.254
I wonder what's going on.

21:06.064 --> 21:08.430
Guess I should go up
and apologize.

21:09.134 --> 21:11.967
-There he is, officer.
-Yeah.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.637
Don't you ever knock?!

21:19.211 --> 21:22.203
I don't know why Rachel had
to drive back with Michael and Carol.

21:22.381 --> 21:23.575
Hey, if you saw me naked...

21:23.749 --> 21:26.309
...I wouldn't wanna ride
in the same car with you either.

21:26.485 --> 21:28.680
I still can't believe
Michael finked on Kramer.

21:28.854 --> 21:32.187
How is he gonna pay off
a $1000 fine?

21:32.357 --> 21:34.621
They got some sort of program.

21:39.531 --> 21:41.021
What?

21:45.937 --> 21:49.429
Hey, there's a tomato stand.
Let's stop. I can get some more.

21:49.841 --> 21:52.105
Hey, isn't that Michael's car?

21:52.311 --> 21:54.541
-There's Rachel.
-Where?

22:05.290 --> 22:09.090
Look at the work that people
will do to get to the ocean.

22:09.261 --> 22:12.526
They'll fight traffic and the heat
and the parking and the hot sand...

22:12.698 --> 22:14.359
...trying to get through the waves...

22:14.533 --> 22:15.898
...and the ironic thing is...

22:16.068 --> 22:19.526
...the ocean doesn't
even really want us in there.

22:19.705 --> 22:20.831
That's what surfing is.

22:21.006 --> 22:24.840
Surfing is the ocean
throwing us out of itself.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.477
You see?

22:26.678 --> 22:28.077
We keep trying to paddle in...

22:28.246 --> 22:30.976
...and the ocean is saying,
"No, you don't."

22:31.350 --> 22:32.874
The ocean is like a nightclub...

22:33.051 --> 22:35.884
...and the waves are bouncers
tossing us out.

22:36.054 --> 22:38.079
The undertow is like
the really mean bouncer.

22:38.256 --> 22:41.487
Instead of throwing you out, they take
you in the back and rough you up.

22:41.660 --> 22:44.720
"Oh, you wanna come in?
How about coming in like 25 miles?"
