00:01.419 --> 00:03.879
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:05.464 --> 00:06.757
She's the Destroyer.

00:08.509 --> 00:11.470
- Ruby! No!
- That girl was a ticking bomb.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.305
You let your emotions get the best of you.

00:13.472 --> 00:15.683
We all have blood on our hands.
Why am I being singled out?

00:15.891 --> 00:17.226
That's not what we do here.

00:17.810 --> 00:20.062
Thinks he found something
connected to the Deathlok program.

00:20.229 --> 00:23.566
- It could keep Coulson alive.
- He called it Centipede Serum.

00:23.816 --> 00:26.360
Garrett's cocktail had
an extra healing component.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.363
All I got was the name of some place
where they found it,

00:29.655 --> 00:33.409
- and I can't find it on any map.
<i>- That's 'cause it's not a place.</i>

00:36.120 --> 00:39.040
<i>I'm here for what was promised.
The gravitonium.</i>

00:39.290 --> 00:40.499
I can fix this.

00:46.756 --> 00:48.215
I told you I could fix this.

01:07.151 --> 01:08.235
Uh... Glenn?

01:10.154 --> 01:12.573
Chin up. Almost there.

01:36.472 --> 01:38.390
Still no word from our forces below?

01:39.475 --> 01:41.936
- No, Commander.
- Then ready the missiles.

01:42.144 --> 01:43.896
Something has entered our docking station.

01:44.063 --> 01:45.106
A terran ship?

01:45.815 --> 01:47.608
The object appears to be human.

01:51.821 --> 01:54.198
You are now prisoners
of the Remorath.

01:54.365 --> 01:55.491
So, what's our play?

01:56.367 --> 02:01.497
You and I are gonna show these ETs
who's boss. Don't worry. I can fix this.

02:02.414 --> 02:04.291
I really wish you'd stop saying that.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.014
Okay, so...

02:19.473 --> 02:22.059
- how much gravitonium did Talbot use?
- All of it.

02:24.103 --> 02:26.480
Well, maybe it's not so bad.
I mean, he did just annihilate

02:26.647 --> 02:28.149
a bunch of Remorath warlords.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.901
But the side-effects of gravitonium
are catastrophic.

02:31.068 --> 02:34.155
- Ruby absorbed just a fraction, and...
- And it drove her completely insane.

02:34.405 --> 02:36.532
Yeah, well, she wasn't
all that stable before.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.993
- Neither was Talbot.
- With his previous brain injury,

02:39.201 --> 02:42.329
I fear that Talbot will almost certainly
suffer a major psychotic break.

02:42.621 --> 02:44.206
We need to find them.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.001
Look, the Lighthouse only just
came back online.

02:47.209 --> 02:49.587
It could be hours before all systems
are fully functional.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.130
Where's Mack?

02:51.297 --> 02:53.257
Went to make sure
the threat's been neutralised.

03:34.298 --> 03:36.175
Not this again.

03:53.609 --> 03:56.028
Mack, no! We need it alive.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.490
This thing is our only chance to find out
what Coulson and Talbot are up against.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.256
Pretty sure we just left
Earth's atmosphere.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.341
Doesn't matter what galaxy
they try and run and hide in.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.635
- We're gonna show 'em who's in charge.
- I feel like we're seeing

04:19.718 --> 04:22.263
this adventure a little differently.
The gravitonium? Why?

04:22.429 --> 04:24.765
- Because I'm our last hope.
- But what about the voices?

04:24.932 --> 04:27.935
Bunch of dead losers, raising a ruckus.
Turns out, all they needed was a general

04:28.143 --> 04:30.604
- to get 'em in line.
- Wish I found that more reassuring.

04:32.064 --> 04:33.482
I'm a little worried about you, Glenn.

04:33.649 --> 04:36.735
It takes most people years to get a handle
on their powers. You skipped the tutorial,

04:36.902 --> 04:39.321
- went straight to big boss level.
- You got to quit worrying, Phil.

04:39.488 --> 04:42.283
I'm feeling fine, tip top.
Even brought my best wing man with me.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.743
What these alien scumbags
didn't count on is squaring off

04:44.910 --> 04:47.454
against the two best military minds
the world has to offer.

04:49.540 --> 04:51.292
No, they most certainly did not.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.759
You dare to approach my ship.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.681
How about letting your wing man
take point on this?

05:09.101 --> 05:13.605
- We're here to negotiate a deal for Earth.
- The Confederacy already has a deal...

05:13.981 --> 05:15.232
- with Hydra.
- Thing is,

05:15.399 --> 05:17.818
Hydra doesn't really speak
for all of humanity.

05:18.277 --> 05:21.739
- Or any of it.
- Hydra spent years kneeling before me,

05:21.989 --> 05:25.326
grovelling at my feet,
and only then did I offer assistance.

05:25.659 --> 05:30.080
Yet you sneak aboard my ship
and have the arrogance to make demands?

05:33.751 --> 05:35.669
I think there's a misunderstanding.

05:37.338 --> 05:40.341
- See, this is my ship.
- Easy, buddy.

05:41.508 --> 05:44.720
- Your impudent tone is only gonna...
- I said this is my ship!

05:54.897 --> 05:57.775
Seems like you got the weight of the world
on your shoulders there, pal.

06:05.824 --> 06:06.867
That's better.

06:10.996 --> 06:13.207
Now... you...

06:15.250 --> 06:16.335
kneel.

06:19.463 --> 06:21.548
I'm not sure that's the best
negotiating tactic...

06:21.715 --> 06:24.802
I said kneel! Before me!

06:42.486 --> 06:43.946
This is pretty good teamwork, Phil.

06:52.329 --> 06:55.082
Hey, I heard about today. You okay?

06:55.958 --> 06:59.628
Yeah. It's not the first creepy crawler
I've had to go toe-to-toe with.

07:01.839 --> 07:03.090
No, I'm good.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.636
Mack...

07:12.599 --> 07:14.393
They're waiting for me.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.068
How many are on that ship?

07:23.819 --> 07:26.780
- He give us any leads?
- Just promises to disembowel us.

07:26.989 --> 07:29.283
The Confederacy stood
more than a thousand years.

07:29.450 --> 07:32.786
They will seek vengeance,
making slaves of you all!

07:32.953 --> 07:36.165
Really wish we could happen
upon some non-slave trading aliens.

07:36.665 --> 07:39.251
Any idea why this one
is more rabid than the rest?

07:39.835 --> 07:41.670
Probably has something to do with this.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.715
I'm pretty sure
this is the same stuff Kasius took.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.302
It must give them
some sort of energy boost.

07:49.011 --> 07:52.848
- You are not worthy of holding the odium.
- Course it would have a dumb name.

07:53.140 --> 07:56.143
- What the hell's that stuff do?
- The odium gives the power of the gods

07:56.310 --> 07:58.270
- to those in final battle.
- First of all, there's only one God.

07:58.437 --> 08:02.900
It is glory through the spilling of blood.
The taste of your enemy's pain.

08:19.041 --> 08:21.710
And God definitely doesn't want you
drinking that garbage.

08:21.877 --> 08:25.005
- Any way to know how it works?
- Not without opening him up.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.344
I'll get right to it.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.429
Well...

08:32.721 --> 08:34.097
Not bad for a day's work.

08:34.890 --> 08:36.850
Gotta admit, I'm impressed.

08:37.768 --> 08:40.020
Though the kneeling may have been
a little over the top.

08:42.313 --> 08:45.108
Do not contradict me, Phil. This is war.

08:45.651 --> 08:48.654
First, we establish dominance,
then we dictate terms, yeah?

08:50.822 --> 08:52.991
Just wanna make sure
we're on the same page.

08:53.367 --> 08:56.370
- Maybe now's the time to talk big picture.
- I'm gonna save the world.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.163
From whom?

08:59.248 --> 09:02.334
The Confederacy decides
what you will and will not do.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.420
- It will not stand idly by while you...
- Stand?

09:06.630 --> 09:09.550
Yeah, I don't see any...
Confederacy members standing.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.553
- You see anybody standing, Phil?
- Hydra was never this foolish.

09:13.011 --> 09:16.515
- Yeah, but where's Hydra now?
- Your ignorance astounds.

09:18.976 --> 09:20.352
That's how they found us.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.773
- Hale.
- Take me to her.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.330
You here as a prisoner?

09:44.209 --> 09:45.544
I sold out your team.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.797
- Yeah.
- Well, it was the only option I had.

09:50.132 --> 09:52.801
Confederacy was done
waiting for gravitonium, and...

09:56.388 --> 09:57.598
without Ruby...

10:00.517 --> 10:01.852
I'm sorry for your loss.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.648
I've been angry for so long.

10:09.401 --> 10:12.571
You know, every time I got passed over...
ignored...

10:13.322 --> 10:15.073
talked down to, I just swallowed it.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.827
I'd tell myself
I'd make it better for Ruby, but...

10:19.244 --> 10:20.579
that anger, just...

10:22.497 --> 10:25.626
It was just always there, the... hatred.

10:27.544 --> 10:30.339
In the end, all I did was carry out
Hydra's agenda.

10:32.424 --> 10:35.260
I never even took a breath
to stop to think about the...

10:37.721 --> 10:39.514
the gift that life had given me.

10:46.521 --> 10:47.564
I failed her.

10:50.442 --> 10:53.195
Ruby died for nothing.

10:53.612 --> 10:55.155
And it was all my fault.

10:59.242 --> 11:00.494
We could use your help.

11:02.412 --> 11:07.042
No...
I got nothing left to give.

11:08.543 --> 11:09.753
You'd be surprised.

11:11.213 --> 11:14.174
Seems there's been a development
with your Destroyer of Worlds project.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.842
Turns out, it's a go.

11:19.638 --> 11:21.223
Daisy Johnson went into the machine?

11:21.682 --> 11:24.935
Actually, it was someone
a little more out of the box.

11:28.313 --> 11:31.650
I think it's time you tell me
about the rest of your <i>compadres.</i>

11:32.859 --> 11:35.445
I would rather die
than betray the Confederacy.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.906
There are six seats.

11:38.073 --> 11:41.910
Kallusians, Rajaks, Astrans
all count themselves members.

11:42.661 --> 11:46.748
Obviously the Remoraths.
And there are two other warrior clans.

11:47.416 --> 11:48.583
You?

11:50.127 --> 11:54.673
You dragged me away from my family...
kept me in a hole for six months.

11:56.007 --> 11:59.177
Messed with my head. Why should I believe
a single word coming out of your mouth?

11:59.469 --> 12:03.056
You have every right to be upset,
but the Confederacy is still out there.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.933
She's the only one who knows
how they operate.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.310
Look, what I did to you was wrong.

12:08.437 --> 12:10.522
But it was all to bring us to this moment.

12:11.273 --> 12:13.316
Humankind is in terrible danger
and you...

12:14.317 --> 12:16.319
you're the weapon
that I was trying to build.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.947
You're the only one that can save us all.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.745
What was Hydra's arrangement
with the Confederacy?

12:24.911 --> 12:28.248
- To protect the Earth from being attacked.
- In exchange for what?

12:28.749 --> 12:29.791
Resources...

12:31.168 --> 12:35.172
- Inhumans, and... gravitonium above all.
- Why gravitonium?

12:35.422 --> 12:37.674
Because its power is unlimited.

12:37.924 --> 12:41.219
It can bend space,
build empires and destroy them.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.638
Couldn't you just find a fun game
on your phone instead?

12:44.347 --> 12:47.517
Look, we need to renegotiate our deal
with the Confederacy.

12:48.143 --> 12:50.854
I think maybe it's time
we started shaking some hands.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.441
Impossible.
A Confederacy gathering is sacred.

12:54.608 --> 12:57.527
A ceremony dating back
over five of your centuries.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.990
Well... as a military man,
I'd hate to buck tradition.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.787
So why don't you bring me up
to speed on protocol?

13:07.454 --> 13:10.373
Even if the Confederacy were
to grant you an audience...

13:11.458 --> 13:12.542
you have nothing to offer.

13:14.628 --> 13:17.756
But... if it's gravitonium
your friends want...

13:18.965 --> 13:22.135
- there he is.
- This is an outright disaster.

13:23.637 --> 13:26.848
It could take hours to re-wire
this antiquated system, and by then,

13:27.015 --> 13:29.935
who knows what cosmos
the Remoraths will have escaped to.

13:33.688 --> 13:34.898
Yeah.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.692
Fixing old electronics
was kinda my thing back in the day,

13:38.026 --> 13:39.069
in the future.

13:40.445 --> 13:43.156
- What are... What are you doing?
- What? It's a thing.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.201
- It's a thing that people do to celebrate.
- Not cool people.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.080
- Come on, man, you're better than that.
- Okay.

13:55.919 --> 13:58.547
It just took Talbot flying out of here
like some sort of a wizard,

13:58.713 --> 14:00.715
in order to be able to breathe
fresh air again.

14:00.882 --> 14:02.926
Well, being a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent
has its risks.

14:03.802 --> 14:06.012
Yeah, but that's just it!
I'm not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent,

14:06.638 --> 14:09.474
but for some reason, I'm still hanging
around this rusty drain pipe.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.060
Well, you do have family here.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.771
Yeah. I don't think it's that.

14:17.399 --> 14:20.277
Oh, well, don't get me wrong.
You guys are great.

14:20.735 --> 14:22.863
Totally not disappointments at all.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.531
<i>Lighthouse, is anyone there?</i>

14:24.698 --> 14:26.575
<i>Over. Repeat. Lighthouse,
this is Daisy Johnson,</i>

14:26.741 --> 14:28.493
<i>- does anyone copy?</i>
- Yeah... yeah, Daisy...

14:28.660 --> 14:31.329
Yeah, we... we're here, Daisy, sorry,
we just had some technical difficulties.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.082
<i>Deke, thank God you're there. I've been
trying to get through for 30 minutes.</i>

14:34.249 --> 14:36.918
<i>- I'm flying in. What's wrong?</i>
- We were under attack.

14:39.963 --> 14:42.424
- Where were you?
- May had me drop off Polly and Robin.

14:42.632 --> 14:44.509
Lie! I know that's not all.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.887
I'm not having this conversation
right now, Yo-Yo. Coulson's missing.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.930
Coulson's missing because of you!

14:49.264 --> 14:51.850
After all your finger-wagging,
the same rules don't apply to you?

14:52.017 --> 14:54.853
You are the last person
who should be giving a lecture right now.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.649
What's in the bag?
Is that what you abandoned us for?

14:59.816 --> 15:01.151
It's none of your business.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.284
What's wrong with you...

15:20.712 --> 15:23.340
We needed you. People died!

15:23.590 --> 15:25.050
Don't put that on me!

15:28.386 --> 15:30.180
What? You wanna use powers now?

15:32.891 --> 15:35.310
Then I definitely win.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.905
- You done?
- May.

15:48.073 --> 15:51.409
Satellite just picked up an object
outside of Earth's atmosphere.

15:51.743 --> 15:55.288
- Piper believes it's the Remorath ship.
- When do we leave?

15:55.580 --> 15:58.667
As soon as the artificial gravity's
installed in the <i>Zephyr.</i>

16:01.169 --> 16:04.422
She's gonna get everyone killed!

16:04.714 --> 16:06.257
We're going to help Coulson.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.595
Either find a way to pitch in,
or don't be here when we get back.

16:21.356 --> 16:22.607
I appreciate the trim,

16:22.774 --> 16:25.819
but feels like a lot of pomp
and circumstance, to me.

16:26.569 --> 16:30.031
We need allies for whatever war
is coming to Earth. Diplomacy is key.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.409
Maybe I should come along,
help navigate any choppy waters.

16:32.575 --> 16:33.785
Best not to rock the boat.

16:34.786 --> 16:38.331
These snowflakes seem awfully precious
about decorum.

16:39.708 --> 16:43.461
- I think I'll just take the alien.
- Okay, but remember... tread lightly.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.132
- Try and get a feel for the room...
- I already told you, I can fix this.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.636
How do I look?

16:54.389 --> 16:55.473
Pretty cool, actually.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.934
I could probably get the boys
to rustle you up one if you want it.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.186
I'm good. Not much of a robes guy.

17:01.146 --> 17:02.897
I'm leaving this man in charge.

17:03.648 --> 17:06.734
Anybody here disobeys an order,
you'll suffer the same pretzel logic

17:06.901 --> 17:10.155
your friend did earlier.
All right, Chuckles. Let's hit it.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.593
The six all stand present.

17:32.802 --> 17:36.056
Let us unite,
under the banner of one true Confederacy.

17:36.598 --> 17:38.099
Qovas, who is this intruder?

17:38.600 --> 17:41.936
This man hails from Earth. He has come...

17:43.146 --> 17:47.609
- to renegotiate terms of their protection.
- The terms have already been set.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.612
Why would we even entertain
such derangement?

17:50.945 --> 17:51.988
Because...

17:54.074 --> 17:56.576
you guys have been dealing
with a bunch of weak amateurs.

17:58.036 --> 18:00.413
It's time you met
Earth's mightiest hero...

18:02.040 --> 18:03.083
Me.

18:16.304 --> 18:17.388
What's in the bag?

18:18.473 --> 18:19.516
My mum.

18:23.895 --> 18:24.938
Oh.

18:29.192 --> 18:30.360
I heard about your little dust-up.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.362
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

18:32.529 --> 18:35.532
I've been better.
It's like the universe keeps reminding me

18:35.698 --> 18:37.617
that I should never have come back
from the future.

18:38.493 --> 18:43.373
Also, some creep put a bunch of lemons
on my bed as some weird sort of... prank.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.753
Sounds like classic Fitz.

18:53.800 --> 18:58.471
Look, I, um... I feel like you're exactly
where you're supposed to be.

18:59.472 --> 19:03.810
I, on the other hand, I...
I lived in the Lighthouse my entire life,

19:04.018 --> 19:06.688
only to time-travel into the past
and still spend every single day

19:06.855 --> 19:09.023
of my life inside the freaking Lighthouse.
So...

19:10.733 --> 19:13.903
it's like, even without Kasius gone,
this place just has this leash

19:14.112 --> 19:15.697
that keeps pulling me back in.

19:16.865 --> 19:20.994
Well, I'm glad you've stuck around.
Even if it's a little... crazy.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.249
Maybe it's not that crazy.

19:29.586 --> 19:32.589
I've been wanting to tell you something,
since we've gotten...

19:33.214 --> 19:36.342
- you know, I don't wanna say closer but...
- You really don't.

19:38.219 --> 19:40.430
Everyone who gets close to me
ends up dying.

19:41.222 --> 19:43.933
Me too. And that's why I feel
like we have so much in common.

19:44.142 --> 19:45.768
- My mum...
- No, I know, and...

19:45.935 --> 19:46.978
Lincoln.

19:48.605 --> 19:49.731
Who's Lincoln?

19:51.149 --> 19:53.860
Uh... Lincoln Campbell. He...

19:55.695 --> 19:58.448
He was the first Inhuman
that I became close with.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.075
Fought at our side and he...

20:02.452 --> 20:03.870
he died.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.874
He died for me, really.

20:10.293 --> 20:14.797
Right when we were... getting going,
or, you know, getting good.

20:16.966 --> 20:19.219
Well, sounds like you were
really in love with this guy.

20:21.387 --> 20:22.847
Kind of still am.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.188
Which is why I...
I can't lose someone else.

20:30.855 --> 20:33.900
And Coulson means more to me...
than anyone.

20:34.192 --> 20:36.444
- And if he goes...
- No, no, no. We'll...

20:38.321 --> 20:39.864
We're gonna find a way to save him.

20:43.368 --> 20:45.662
Sorry, you...
You were gonna tell me something?

20:51.251 --> 20:55.171
Yeah, Fitz-Simmons...
are my grandparents.

20:56.089 --> 20:59.300
- What? Wait, what?
- I know.

20:59.509 --> 21:01.427
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hm.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.597
- Do they know?
- Yeah. Yeah.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.516
Cat's totally out of the food sack.

21:06.933 --> 21:12.021
Oh, my God. That makes so much sense.
You and Fitz are both so...

21:12.855 --> 21:15.149
You...You're such special people.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.860
Good. I...

21:18.736 --> 21:21.197
I was worried that it was gonna make
things weird between us.

21:21.489 --> 21:23.574
Wait, why would it make things weird?

21:25.618 --> 21:27.537
No reason.

21:29.872 --> 21:32.542
This man is clearly a charlatan.

21:33.293 --> 21:36.045
No mortal being can wield
the power of gravitonium.

21:36.587 --> 21:38.006
Especially not some...

21:39.424 --> 21:40.508
human.

21:41.134 --> 21:44.220
I submit we strip him to rags,
then put him to auction.

21:45.346 --> 21:47.390
That would be most unwise, Estella.

21:48.141 --> 21:51.227
He has somehow harnessed gravitonium
within himself.

21:51.561 --> 21:53.313
Even so, it has no bearing.

21:53.771 --> 21:57.066
This man is not of the Confederacy.
He has no business here.

21:57.400 --> 22:00.403
Well then maybe it's time you made me
a part of your little secret society.

22:00.611 --> 22:04.324
Impossible! For centuries the Confederacy
has had but six members.

22:04.866 --> 22:07.285
To add another would desecrate the order.

22:08.036 --> 22:11.331
This is like
a room full of... Democrats.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.624
You get your rules and your regulations.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.251
Who's really in charge here?

22:15.460 --> 22:18.671
This is a Confederacy.
All voices are equal.

22:19.422 --> 22:24.177
Though... Crixon is often considered
the most wise amongst us.

22:27.221 --> 22:28.890
The fact remains...

22:29.891 --> 22:34.228
there is simply...
no place for a human amongst us.

22:35.396 --> 22:37.690
Your mistake is thinking I'm still human.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.233
Well...

23:21.901 --> 23:24.237
it looks like there's a spot for me here
after all.

23:43.798 --> 23:45.341
Good job getting this assembled.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.177
That it?

23:49.637 --> 23:50.680
Yeah.

24:11.242 --> 24:13.661
Guess we just built
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s first space ship.

24:15.163 --> 24:16.205
Mack...

24:18.833 --> 24:21.335
I just wanted to apologise, for...

24:22.879 --> 24:25.214
locking you up... before.

24:26.591 --> 24:29.510
- Really wasn't my idea. I actually... I...
- You went along with it.

24:31.554 --> 24:34.807
Yeah, well, we were trying
to get ahead of the problem.

24:36.726 --> 24:38.519
By having Yo-Yo execute a kid.

24:43.107 --> 24:44.650
Things got messy. But, uh...

24:44.817 --> 24:48.404
- I mean, it was the only way that Yo-Yo...
- When does killing become the only way?

24:50.281 --> 24:52.825
We're S.H.I.E.L.D.
Aren't we supposed to be better than that?

24:53.743 --> 24:55.286
None of this would've happened
if you would have just said

24:55.369 --> 24:57.455
this invincible nonsense wasn't real.

24:57.747 --> 25:00.458
But instead, you and Simmons lit the match
and now Yo-Yo's responsible

25:00.625 --> 25:02.376
- for a girl's death.
- I'm sorry, Mack.

25:04.921 --> 25:05.963
I really am.

25:08.925 --> 25:11.010
- But it's not that simple.
- Simple...

25:12.428 --> 25:13.804
is how you live a good life.

25:15.389 --> 25:18.559
Not with your theories, or prophecies.

25:18.976 --> 25:21.771
It's following the good word
and doing the right thing every time.

25:22.813 --> 25:23.940
Simple as that.

25:25.274 --> 25:26.317
No.

25:28.277 --> 25:29.904
Not always. Because...

25:31.113 --> 25:33.491
there are lots of instances
in history where...

25:34.617 --> 25:36.953
where it was necessary to sacrifice
the few,

25:37.119 --> 25:38.663
in order to save the lives of many.

25:43.167 --> 25:44.502
Of course, you'd say that.

25:46.379 --> 25:50.967
Ruby was dangerous, and it got complicated
and that is just the way it was.

25:51.342 --> 25:53.511
So, I'm sorry, if that doesn't fit...

25:54.971 --> 25:57.056
whatever narrative
that you've built for yourself.

25:57.640 --> 25:58.975
You need to look inside yourself

25:59.141 --> 26:00.935
and figure out what kind of man
you want to be.

26:02.562 --> 26:04.146
'Cause lately, what you've been?

26:06.732 --> 26:08.025
It needs fixing.

26:28.838 --> 26:30.006
What happened there?

26:30.506 --> 26:32.967
This Remorath ingested a substance
that stimulated

26:33.175 --> 26:37.597
- every single cell in its body.
- And what, its... heart exploded?

26:38.347 --> 26:41.183
- Rather macabre, isn't it?
- Just you wait.

26:50.901 --> 26:52.153
Where did you get that?

26:52.612 --> 26:55.114
What matters is that we might be able
to save Coulson,

26:55.364 --> 27:00.536
- by combining that with my... mum's DNA.
- Oh, Daisy...

27:02.163 --> 27:03.748
this feels like we may be crossing a line.

27:03.914 --> 27:04.999
Then we cross it.

27:05.541 --> 27:08.377
- Are you just willing to let Coulson die?
- It's not that simple.

27:08.544 --> 27:11.213
- There are moral implications.
- This isn't a morality debate,

27:11.380 --> 27:14.800
it's just a question. Are you willing
to let Coulson die? Yes or no?

27:16.927 --> 27:17.970
No.

27:19.388 --> 27:22.850
Good. Then get to work.
This is your top priority.

27:30.191 --> 27:32.735
- We space ready?
- Looks like we're about to find out.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.029
You coming with?

27:35.696 --> 27:37.865
Yeah. I just need to get
out of the Lighthouse.

27:38.115 --> 27:40.701
So you're going on a space mission
to a hostile alien ship?

27:42.119 --> 27:44.872
Yeah. Well, I don't...
have that many options.

27:45.039 --> 27:48.834
This is <i>Zephyr One.</i>
We're all systems go.

27:49.085 --> 27:51.295
Roger that, <i>Zephyr.</i>
You are clear for take-off.

28:12.441 --> 28:15.611
You were right
to bring this man here, Qovas.

28:16.654 --> 28:19.907
Truly... he stands a giant.

28:20.700 --> 28:24.245
As always, you see wisdom,
while the others cower in fear.

28:24.495 --> 28:26.706
A strength of our warrior breeding.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.291
I'm sorry, partner.
I didn't get your name earlier.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.002
No apology necessary, the honour is mine.

28:33.212 --> 28:37.717
I am the first-born Taryan,
master of the house Kasius.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.220
Kasius. Well, that certainly has a ring.

28:41.846 --> 28:45.433
The way you handled yourself today
was quite admirable.

28:46.892 --> 28:50.646
Though I fear... your Earth faces
a far more pressing threat

28:50.813 --> 28:52.732
than anything posed by our Confederacy.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.942
Is this the attack Qovas warned
might be coming?

28:55.151 --> 28:57.611
It shall be the end of your planet.

28:57.778 --> 29:01.073
That's why Hale had a deal
with the Confederacy to fight beside us.

29:01.449 --> 29:05.745
The Confederacy never intended to honour
this agreement, nor could it,

29:05.911 --> 29:09.749
even if it so desired,
it was merely a deception to extort

29:09.915 --> 29:12.752
the resources from your planet
before time ran out.

29:14.086 --> 29:17.423
- Which now it has.
- What are you saying?

29:18.048 --> 29:19.091
Thanos,

29:19.258 --> 29:22.011
and his forces have begun an assault
on your world, even as we speak.

29:22.178 --> 29:25.598
Well then, I've gotta get down there
with the Avengers and take on this Thanos.

29:25.765 --> 29:28.934
Thanos's strength is unrivalled.
You will lose, even...

29:29.518 --> 29:32.521
with your powerful friends
fighting alongside you.

29:35.024 --> 29:36.066
Though perhaps...

29:37.860 --> 29:39.904
there might still be a way.

29:44.408 --> 29:47.453
Astronauts say the view of Earth
from space changes you.

29:48.871 --> 29:50.873
That's why I always wanted to be one.

29:51.415 --> 29:54.084
Malick had Project Distant Star
running inside NASA.

29:54.794 --> 29:56.253
Why didn't you go work for him?

29:56.670 --> 29:59.965
Leadership had other plans for me.

30:04.261 --> 30:07.181
Really rolled the dice
letting Talbot go out on his own.

30:07.556 --> 30:10.184
Not to mention, we have no way out
if things go sideways.

30:10.559 --> 30:12.019
Artillery, I'm guessing.

30:12.686 --> 30:16.106
Probably have enough firepower there
to incinerate your entire base.

30:22.738 --> 30:24.448
It seems the situation
is worse than we feared.

30:24.824 --> 30:27.368
The Earth is under attack
by an alien named Thanos.

30:27.535 --> 30:29.870
What about the Confederacy?
Did they agree to help us?

30:30.120 --> 30:32.790
More bark than bite.
I'm afraid we're on our own, General.

30:33.374 --> 30:35.793
- We have to get back.
- And do what exactly?

30:36.168 --> 30:37.628
The only option left...

30:38.921 --> 30:40.005
Make me invincible.

30:41.382 --> 30:42.424
Excuse me?

30:42.758 --> 30:45.052
I struck up a conversation
with this guy from the Confederacy.

30:45.678 --> 30:49.640
He tells me there's untapped deposits
of gravitonium under the Earth's surface.

30:50.432 --> 30:53.143
And you want to get it out
and power yourself up more.

30:53.394 --> 30:55.896
Well, that way I can handle
any threat the Earth faces.

30:56.856 --> 30:59.358
I can be... the "shield."

31:00.776 --> 31:02.486
Can we just talk about this for a second?

31:02.653 --> 31:04.613
No! You don't get to call
a time-out, Phil!

31:04.864 --> 31:08.284
- Our very way of life is under threat!
- Which we will find a way to defeat.

31:08.617 --> 31:09.660
But gravitonium?

31:09.869 --> 31:11.620
It's too dangerous,
you could lose control!

31:11.787 --> 31:16.417
I've never been more in control!
You know, it is just like you,

31:16.667 --> 31:17.960
to second-guess me.

31:19.962 --> 31:22.798
Or is it now that you've seen
gravitonium's power,

31:22.965 --> 31:24.341
you want it all for yourself.

31:25.092 --> 31:26.635
That's not what's happening
and you know it.

31:26.802 --> 31:28.012
Do I?

31:28.262 --> 31:31.390
How many times have we worked
together, only for me later to find out

31:31.557 --> 31:34.894
- you weren't being above-board?
- Do you trust this Confederacy member

31:35.060 --> 31:38.898
- who told you about the gravitonium?
- Yeah. Real straight shooter.

31:39.189 --> 31:42.067
Named Kasius.
Said he has two sons of his own.

31:42.276 --> 31:45.321
Did you say Kasius?
Glenn, you're being played.

31:45.821 --> 31:48.407
- You can't trust him.
- The hell is wrong with you, Phil?

31:49.366 --> 31:52.119
First you question my capacity
to handle myself,

31:52.453 --> 31:55.205
and then it's our allies,
who you begged me to make.

31:55.456 --> 31:58.792
I know it sounds crazy, but the alien
running Earth in the future,

31:58.959 --> 32:01.170
- was a Kasius. He's our enemy.
- Kasius...

32:01.462 --> 32:03.464
is the most noble family
in the Confederacy.

32:04.381 --> 32:05.758
This man is clearly lying.

32:08.093 --> 32:11.555
So, what? Is this another angle
you're playing, Phil?

32:11.722 --> 32:13.307
- Glenn...
- We are at war!

32:14.642 --> 32:16.185
A war we will surely lose

32:16.352 --> 32:18.979
if I am not the most powerful being
in the universe.

32:19.146 --> 32:20.522
No. There's gotta be another way.

32:20.814 --> 32:23.442
- We can use this ship and attack...
- This is not a debate!

32:28.238 --> 32:29.448
I'm in charge here!

32:30.366 --> 32:33.285
You're either with me, or against me.

32:33.869 --> 32:36.288
- Obviously, I'm with you.
- Then kneel.

32:39.291 --> 32:42.169
- What?
- I'm Earth's last hope, Phil.

32:42.836 --> 32:46.757
Its true protector.
The one who can save us all.

32:48.842 --> 32:50.344
Now, either you accept that...

33:10.948 --> 33:12.408
...or suffer the consequences.

33:17.246 --> 33:18.288
Kneel.

33:40.352 --> 33:41.854
Artificial gravity engaged.

33:42.563 --> 33:44.606
Approaching Outer Atmosphere.

33:44.773 --> 33:48.110
<i>- Prepare for vertical burn.</i>
- Roger that. Vertical burn is a go.

34:11.216 --> 34:12.551
<i>Zephyr</i> press to MECO.

34:13.177 --> 34:16.304
- Thrusters at full.
<i>- Zephyr,</i> shut down plan is nominal.

34:17.848 --> 34:19.516
I probably should have talked you
out of this.

34:19.766 --> 34:20.809
What?

34:21.018 --> 34:24.772
No, this is great. I...
I'm going to space... again.

34:27.565 --> 34:28.817
Thanks for coming along.

34:35.866 --> 34:37.284
We're approaching the Karman Line.

34:39.453 --> 34:40.496
Nominal MECO.

34:40.746 --> 34:43.623
- Main Thruster is no longer required.
- Copy <i>Zephyr</i>. Nominal MECO.

34:43.791 --> 34:45.292
Main Thruster no longer required.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.210
Prepare to be the first S.H.I.E.L.D. team
in space.

34:47.418 --> 34:49.004
In this timeline, maybe.

34:56.136 --> 34:57.679
<i>Looks like we did it, Control.</i>

34:57.846 --> 35:00.015
<i>Roger that, Zephyr.
Good work, you guys.</i>

35:00.307 --> 35:01.767
<i>Time to turn on cloaking.</i>

35:01.934 --> 35:04.103
<i>- Won't be long till you reach the ship.</i>
- Copy that.

35:24.414 --> 35:26.250
Looks like the <i>Zephyr's</i> in space.

35:27.501 --> 35:28.627
Because of your design.

35:31.672 --> 35:33.632
I know you'd rather be up
in Control right now.

35:33.882 --> 35:35.592
No. It's probably best I'm not.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.645
So, the Centipede Formula
is functioning as what?

35:47.521 --> 35:51.817
Some sort of catalyst to unleash
Jiaying's regenerative properties?

35:52.109 --> 35:53.402
That's the hope.

35:55.195 --> 35:57.406
You really think
this is a good idea?

35:59.449 --> 36:03.537
What I think is...
the less we talk about it the better.

36:04.788 --> 36:07.082
Now unzip that duffel
and get me a viable sample.

36:18.260 --> 36:19.970
Approaching enemy ship.

36:20.971 --> 36:23.348
No signs of resistance yet.

36:26.268 --> 36:28.145
- That is one big ship.
- Just remember,

36:28.312 --> 36:29.521
the minute the <i>Zephyr</i> docks,

36:29.688 --> 36:31.523
cloaking won't matter.
You need to be ready to move.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.323
Strike team in position.

36:53.253 --> 36:56.924
Quinn's team originally found gravitonium
at the bottom of one of his mines.

36:57.382 --> 36:58.634
How did you know that?

37:00.385 --> 37:01.553
He just told me.

37:02.971 --> 37:05.224
Sensors indicate an unseen object
has breached our hull.

37:05.641 --> 37:07.684
- How is that possible?
- Cloaking.

37:10.479 --> 37:11.855
What is S.H.I.E.L.D. doing here?

37:13.273 --> 37:15.484
- I guess, providing back-up.
- This is mutiny!

37:16.902 --> 37:18.987
- You made contact behind my back.
- That's not true.

37:19.154 --> 37:21.573
- They're here to do what? Take my ship?
- You've got this all wrong.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.533
You're a liar! You're a liar!

37:26.036 --> 37:27.871
Did you have any part in this?

37:31.792 --> 37:33.752
I told Coulson not to do it,
he wouldn't listen to me.

37:34.127 --> 37:35.504
Also not true.

37:37.839 --> 37:39.383
Find the intruders and take them out.

37:40.050 --> 37:41.760
They're here to help. What are you doing?

37:44.680 --> 37:46.473
Glenn, don't do this.

37:46.932 --> 37:49.351
You have betrayed me
for the last time, Phil.

37:50.394 --> 37:52.187
Whatever happens next is on you.

37:59.319 --> 38:00.612
That's a start.

38:02.990 --> 38:07.202
- S.H.I.E.L.D. is not your enemy.
- All these years, double-crossing me.

38:07.911 --> 38:09.121
I should have known better.

38:14.584 --> 38:16.378
You quake and Coulson dies!

38:17.796 --> 38:20.048
- What are you doing?
- S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't welcome here.

38:21.008 --> 38:23.760
- This is my ship!
- This is an alien ship.

38:24.344 --> 38:26.471
- We're here to rescue you.
- Rescue me?

38:27.014 --> 38:28.598
I'm the one that's gonna save us!

38:28.849 --> 38:30.684
Then put Coulson down
and we can talk about that.

38:30.851 --> 38:32.894
Agent Johnson,
always in the centre of the storm.

38:34.187 --> 38:37.149
- Maybe that's because you're the problem.
- If I'm the one you want, fine.

38:37.691 --> 38:39.484
I won't resist.
But first you have to put Coulson down.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.945
You and I both know you can't be trusted.

38:42.696 --> 38:43.864
I trust her.

38:47.159 --> 38:50.037
- Why would you trust Quake?
- Because she kept her word.

38:50.954 --> 38:53.665
When Ruby was infected with gravitonium,
she tried to help.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.834
Infected? Ruby was weak.

38:57.085 --> 39:00.255
The gravitonium wasn't intended
for some itty-bitty little girl.

39:00.630 --> 39:03.216
It was meant for a hero,
strong enough to handle it!

39:04.926 --> 39:07.679
You need to take a deep breath
and calm your mind, Glenn.

39:20.859 --> 39:21.943
You know what's best.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.364
It's best if you comply.

39:26.656 --> 39:28.408
Compliance will be rewarded.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.079
That's right.

39:36.416 --> 39:37.709
And so will your betrayal.

40:15.580 --> 40:19.292
Go ahead, fire that weapon, Agent May,
and Coulson dies, just like Hale.

40:24.089 --> 40:25.465
Do you surrender, Agent May?

40:38.645 --> 40:39.813
What should we do with them?

40:43.066 --> 40:45.777
They're prisoners of war.
Treat them accordingly.

40:47.737 --> 40:51.450
- It didn't have to be like this.
- You were always the enemy, Phil.

40:52.325 --> 40:54.953
Only now I have the clarity of mind
to see it.

41:11.344 --> 41:12.387
The Earth...

41:13.138 --> 41:15.474
is no longer a hidden blue gem.

41:16.766 --> 41:18.268
It belongs to another now.

41:21.730 --> 41:24.441
And yet it still has gifts to give.

41:27.611 --> 41:30.238
I look forward to taking mine home.
