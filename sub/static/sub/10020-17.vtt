WEBVTT

00:04.179 --> 00:06.829
ER

00:06.830 --> 00:07.949
Previously on ER...

00:07.950 --> 00:11.012
- ...you slam the door in my face.
- ...you just choose not to! Thank you!

00:11.013 --> 00:14.114
Next month my hair will grow back
and you'll still be sorry.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.692
Just for that, I get to pick the movie.

00:15.693 --> 00:18.807
How long's it been since you've had
something really juicy?

00:19.208 --> 00:22.684
From now on, a pediatrician
is consulted in all Pedes cases.

00:22.685 --> 00:24.698
Carlos has put recess to day care.

00:24.699 --> 00:26.836
...HemoAid in vascular procedures.
Have you heard of it?

00:26.837 --> 00:28.168
It's the artificial blood.

00:28.169 --> 00:29.169
Thought you'd like in on it.

00:29.170 --> 00:32.202
- You don't mind if I take over a little bit?
- Praise Allah, no!

00:32.203 --> 00:34.135
 3 in respiratory arrest.

00:34.153 --> 00:35.439
- What?
- It's Chase.

00:35.474 --> 00:37.382
He has probable brain damage.

00:38.073 --> 00:40.776
"A Bloody Mess"

00:43.507 --> 00:46.292
All right. So give it up.
Where are we going?

00:46.507 --> 00:49.256
- Actually, we're right here.
- We are?

00:52.925 --> 00:54.417
Rock climbing? Are you serious?

00:54.633 --> 00:57.916
You wanted to get into shape
for Yosemite this summer, so...

00:58.133 --> 01:01.049
This is the bomb!
Jeanie, you're the best!

01:02.051 --> 01:03.592
This place is packed.

01:03.801 --> 01:05.876
Listen, I wanna talk
to you about this.

01:06.093 --> 01:08.463
- Doug, a couple of chairs.
- All right.

01:09.594 --> 01:12.545
- What happened to Carter?
- I don't know. I found him that way.

01:12.927 --> 01:14.254
He's really filling out.

01:14.468 --> 01:17.420
Yeah. Seventy-fifth percentile
for full-term his age.

01:17.594 --> 01:20.794
Looks like you've really gotten
a handle on this parenting routine.

01:20.969 --> 01:24.086
It's easy. I just make a schedule
and stick to it.

01:24.845 --> 01:27.677
As a matter of fact,
that's our 15 minutes of quality time.

01:28.262 --> 01:30.252
Daycare for you and a fem-pop for me.

01:30.471 --> 01:32.924
Hey, hey, hey, are you okay?

01:34.221 --> 01:35.418
Are you ready?

01:39.846 --> 01:42.382
And a quick pit stop at the showers.

01:42.764 --> 01:45.964
Yeah, right. Oh, man!
Go ahead and laugh.

01:46.180 --> 01:47.259
All right, come on.

01:47.889 --> 01:50.425
Come here. You got Daddy.
You got me.

01:50.640 --> 01:53.638
You got me. All right, say bye.
I'll see you guys later.

01:53.848 --> 01:55.258
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:57.265 --> 01:59.932
Peter Benton the father.
You gotta see it to believe it.

02:00.099 --> 02:02.848
All right.
Now, what I've been thinking about-

02:03.057 --> 02:04.514
Carter! Carter!

02:04.724 --> 02:06.715
- What?
- Your pager.

02:07.933 --> 02:09.213
Oh, man.

02:09.684 --> 02:11.887
It's the ER, of course.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.975
We didn't get to sit down.

02:14.184 --> 02:17.715
If you wanna talk, we could catch
the Bulls game tonight at McGee's.

02:17.892 --> 02:19.883
We haven't been out
on the town in a while.

02:20.059 --> 02:22.928
- Sure. All right. Maybe.
- You can check with Carol.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.760
I don't have to ask her permission.

02:27.519 --> 02:28.597
Oh, man!

02:28.768 --> 02:31.340
- I tried to swerve around him.
- Don't let him die.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.386
- Get me 8 units of HemoAid.
- Hemo-what?

02:33.602 --> 02:35.510
- Blood substitute.
- Grab consent forms.

02:35.686 --> 02:38.638
- Where is everyone?
- I've paged them all, twice.

02:38.811 --> 02:41.301
Seventeen-year-old with neck pain,
contusions, abrasions.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.392
- Get this off of me.
- Take slow breaths.

02:43.603 --> 02:44.848
Check the next one.

02:45.021 --> 02:46.762
- What do we got?
- Twenty-year-old passenger.

02:46.937 --> 02:50.268
No seat belt, complaining of neck,
shoulder, chest and abdominal pain.

02:50.479 --> 02:52.636
Questionable LOC for several seconds.

02:52.855 --> 02:54.017
Up and over.

02:54.397 --> 02:56.268
Check vitals.
See if she's hypovolemic.

02:56.438 --> 03:00.303
Need a cross-table C-spine, chest and
pelvis x-rays, CBC, and dip a urine.

03:00.522 --> 03:02.264
Was the transport under
half an hour?

03:02.439 --> 03:04.395
Must've been.
The accident was nearby.

03:04.606 --> 03:06.681
- Lungs are clear.
- I got the HemoAid.

03:06.898 --> 03:09.517
- What's her name?
- Ann Witchger.

03:09.732 --> 03:13.429
Miss Witchger, I'm conducting
a lifesaving research project.

03:13.606 --> 03:16.096
Tell me, do you object to the use
of blood products?

03:16.274 --> 03:18.810
- Were they tested on animals?
- Bowel sounds present.

03:19.024 --> 03:22.023
- Yes. I believe they have.
- No. No animal testing.

03:22.233 --> 03:24.686
- Pulse 100. Resps 20.
- BP's normal.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.104
Where the hell's all this blood
coming from?

03:29.442 --> 03:30.769
Cow's blood?

03:31.859 --> 03:33.731
We got it from a slaughterhouse.

03:33.943 --> 03:36.610
- This is all cow's blood?
- I told you it was a bad idea.

03:36.777 --> 03:40.556
We were on our way to protest
the university's use of cats in research.

03:40.777 --> 03:42.851
We thought blood
would make an impression.

03:43.027 --> 03:45.313
- It did.
- You hear what they were transporting?

03:45.485 --> 03:47.192
- We just heard.
- What do you got?

03:47.611 --> 03:50.251
One squirrel, DOA.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:48.726 --> 04:51.643
Reminds me of Carrie.
The movie, not the Attending.

04:51.854 --> 04:53.017
You're funny.

04:53.231 --> 04:56.398
Can we go to the 7:00 movie?
I won't make it to the 9:20.

04:56.567 --> 04:58.809
- I thought it was tomorrow.
- I thought tonight.

04:58.986 --> 05:01.275
I just told Mark that we'd
watch the Bulls game.

05:01.448 --> 05:04.947
- Good time to tell him your decision.
- We can watch the game anytime.

05:05.159 --> 05:06.618
I think you should see Mark.

05:06.827 --> 05:09.615
Hey, Doug. I just got a call
from Neal Bernstein.

05:09.832 --> 05:13.532
He said your ER fellowship-renewal
papers were due two days ago.

05:13.710 --> 05:16.331
You can't blow this off.
If you want this to continue-

05:16.505 --> 05:18.995
Kerry, maybe I don't want
my fellowship to continue.

05:19.174 --> 05:21.333
Got a kid in Exam 4
with a pencil up his nose.

05:21.511 --> 05:24.511
- We need to discuss this.
- All right. We will.

05:25.931 --> 05:27.555
Hail, comrades!

05:27.766 --> 05:30.720
David! We weren't expecting you back
until next month.

05:30.936 --> 05:32.680
Well, I missed you too damn much.

05:32.855 --> 05:35.525
Look at this place.
Looks exactly the way I remember it.

05:35.691 --> 05:37.684
Actually, we have made
a few improvements.

05:37.861 --> 05:39.652
I saw you eyeing those.
Help yourself.

05:39.820 --> 05:41.778
I made those with my own hands.

05:41.948 --> 05:43.406
It is Jerry, isn't it?

05:43.616 --> 05:45.159
David. You've been gone a while.

05:45.326 --> 05:47.948
One hundred and ninety-seven days.
Give me a hug.

05:49.539 --> 05:52.077
- You're looking trim, Mark.
- You look good yourself.

05:52.251 --> 05:54.289
You know, it sounds hackneyed...

05:54.460 --> 05:57.878
...but that myocardial infarction
was the best thing to happen to me.

05:58.090 --> 06:01.256
I intended to prepare a summary
report to bring you up to speed.

06:01.468 --> 06:03.093
No, Kerry. We'll talk shop later.

06:03.303 --> 06:05.130
I'm here to spend time
in the trenches.

06:05.305 --> 06:07.878
To get in touch with the people
that make this place tick.

06:08.058 --> 06:09.303
Mark, what you got?

06:09.518 --> 06:12.519
Thirty-two-year-old female,
high fever for five days.

06:12.730 --> 06:16.098
One of the things I learned
from my brush with mortality...

06:16.316 --> 06:20.314
...is that every patient has a story.
Let's go learn hers, shall we?

06:22.114 --> 06:26.776
Clamp distally, then check for leaks
at the proximal anastomosis.

06:26.995 --> 06:28.620
Is that you, Peter?

06:28.830 --> 06:31.499
Elizabeth? What are you doing here?

06:31.666 --> 06:35.746
I wanted to confirm our plans
to work on Rocket's lit review.

06:35.962 --> 06:40.292
Seven to 9:30, Biomed Library.
I'll meet you there.

06:40.509 --> 06:43.260
How about 9:31 we grab
a bite to eat?

06:43.428 --> 06:46.679
I have to prep for an operation.
So if you don't mind, could you...?

06:46.848 --> 06:49.055
We could work at my place
and get some takeout.

06:49.226 --> 06:53.058
I know you've been wanting to see
me naked. But this isn't the way, okay?

06:54.189 --> 06:55.268
Thank you. Thank you.

06:55.482 --> 06:59.101
- So, what is your answer?
- Yeah, yeah. Dinner. Fine, fine.

06:59.320 --> 07:03.613
But I've gotta prep
for a pancreatic pseudocyst...

07:03.824 --> 07:06.031
...so I'm not gonna be able to...

07:11.666 --> 07:13.991
- Please, someone help me!
- We need a gurney here!

07:14.168 --> 07:16.375
- What happened?
- She's pregnant and passed out.

07:16.546 --> 07:18.337
Okay. Easy. It's okay.

07:18.548 --> 07:21.549
- Jerry, what's open?
- Curtain Area 3.

07:21.884 --> 07:23.794
- How far along is she?
- Karen's 18 weeks.

07:23.970 --> 07:25.464
But she's having a rough time.

07:26.055 --> 07:27.254
Karen, I'm Dr. Del Amico.

07:27.473 --> 07:30.759
We're gonna do some tests on you.
Ready? One, two, three.

07:30.977 --> 07:32.520
Please don't hurt my baby.

07:32.730 --> 07:34.437
We won't, don't worry.

07:35.482 --> 07:36.562
Open up.

07:38.110 --> 07:40.435
Dry skin and mucous membranes.
She's dehydrated.

07:40.613 --> 07:42.522
Start a line and bolus
liter of saline.

07:42.697 --> 07:46.447
- BP's 120 palp.
- Get a CBC, Chem-7, and a UA.

07:46.702 --> 07:48.909
- She's got no veins.
- I'll do an IJ line.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.704
You're gonna be okay now.

07:53.793 --> 07:55.869
That's all right, Karen.

07:57.379 --> 08:00.584
Now, just grab that left handhold
and you're there.

08:00.759 --> 08:02.039
All right!

08:02.218 --> 08:04.176
- All right!
- Ready to lower.

08:04.429 --> 08:05.839
Lowering.

08:10.477 --> 08:12.636
Did you really only take two lessons?

08:12.855 --> 08:15.392
My instructor said women
are more natural climbers.

08:15.565 --> 08:16.846
It's all in the hips.

08:17.025 --> 08:20.810
That's great. I think after that climb
you deserve a pop.

08:21.029 --> 08:22.108
You chickening out?

08:23.115 --> 08:27.492
No. I'm not chickening.
I just thought you might be thirsty.

08:27.703 --> 08:30.075
Nice try, pal. Your turn.

08:38.797 --> 08:40.542
Good job. You make it look easy.

08:43.428 --> 08:45.385
- I can't.
- You're doing great.

08:46.347 --> 08:48.719
- Let me down!
- There's a foothold by your foot.

08:48.933 --> 08:52.765
- Let me down. I want to come down.
- Okay. Lowering.

08:54.982 --> 08:56.973
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have pushed so hard.

08:57.317 --> 08:58.942
Did you hurt yourself?

08:59.111 --> 09:00.570
We'll just take a break, okay?

09:06.201 --> 09:07.661
McGee's has those devil wings.

09:07.829 --> 09:11.778
Come on. Hog Head McDunna's
$1.99 all-you-can-eat taco bar...

09:11.958 --> 09:13.534
...and live music after the game?

09:13.708 --> 09:17.374
Jerry, can you see that these protocol
summaries make it into everyone's box?

09:17.546 --> 09:19.623
For you, Dr. Corday,
it would be a pleasure.

09:19.799 --> 09:22.254
Elizabeth? I was just
looking over your study...

09:22.468 --> 09:26.300
...and I noticed that I'm listed
as the only faculty advisor.

09:26.514 --> 09:29.265
Yes. Thanks for helping me bring
HemoAid to the ER.

09:29.475 --> 09:31.516
I assumed Dr. Romano was involved.

09:31.686 --> 09:35.767
He wanted to focus on the surgical
applications of substitute blood.

09:35.982 --> 09:38.141
I'm surprised he let you
go ahead on your own.

09:39.027 --> 09:40.485
Truth is, he doesn't know yet.

09:42.740 --> 09:43.902
Trying to break free?

09:44.908 --> 09:46.402
It's more like branching out.

09:46.577 --> 09:48.901
- Do you mind being the only advisor?
- Not at all.

09:49.079 --> 09:51.451
As far as I'm concerned,
the study's all yours.

09:51.665 --> 09:52.779
Good.

09:54.042 --> 09:55.834
She lost almost six pounds last week.

09:56.003 --> 09:58.126
BP, 100/60.

09:58.296 --> 10:00.622
- I wanna go home.
- Please, let them help you.

10:00.841 --> 10:04.791
Her OB's had her on a saltine cracker
diet. How can anyone survive on that?

10:05.012 --> 10:06.293
I cannot lose this baby.

10:06.514 --> 10:08.553
She's already had three miscarriages.

10:09.141 --> 10:11.715
- Karen?
- She's out. Trendelenburg.

10:16.065 --> 10:17.808
I'm okay. I'm okay.

10:18.025 --> 10:21.062
It's okay. Let's add multivites
and put her on a monitor.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.067
Wait. It's all right.

10:23.282 --> 10:25.404
Why? She should be past
morning sickness.

10:25.575 --> 10:28.493
For some, nausea and vomiting
persist throughout pregnancy.

10:28.703 --> 10:30.530
Nine months?
She'll never make it.

10:30.747 --> 10:32.954
Once her labs are back,
we'll know our options.

10:33.166 --> 10:36.333
- Do whatever it takes to save her.
- I understand.

10:38.088 --> 10:41.587
Rock climbing? Were you planning
to outshine me this summer?

10:41.758 --> 10:42.956
I paged Doug Ross.

10:43.177 --> 10:46.094
Good. Listen, I was just about
to start a splenorenal shunt.

10:46.305 --> 10:49.009
But I can get somebody
to cover for me.

10:49.183 --> 10:51.260
That's not necessary.
Scott just overdid it.

10:51.435 --> 10:54.057
It's cool, Dad.
Jeanie'll keep me company.

10:55.065 --> 10:58.184
All right. But you'll page me
as soon as Doug's looked at him?

10:58.401 --> 10:59.775
Don't worry. I will.

11:00.110 --> 11:02.732
I plan on kicking butt at
the Investigators' quarterly.

11:02.906 --> 11:05.693
Dayton can't come close to my
HemoAid transfusion rates.

11:05.909 --> 11:08.696
Congratulations. I'm releasing distally.

11:08.870 --> 11:10.033
Looks dry.

11:10.205 --> 11:13.455
Don't feel slighted that I involved
Lizzie in the study and not you.

11:13.625 --> 11:17.160
- No. Of course not.
- Peter, what a good liar you are.

11:17.337 --> 11:18.582
Branches of the popliteal?

11:18.756 --> 11:21.293
Anterior tibial, posterior tibial
and peroneal.

11:21.508 --> 11:23.963
You're the man!
Now comes the fun part.

11:24.135 --> 11:26.508
Release proximally
and watch the river run.

11:27.722 --> 11:29.716
Dr. Benton, daycare center's
on the phone.

11:29.892 --> 11:32.299
- Is it urgent?
- They want you to come up.

11:32.478 --> 11:34.352
Okay. Ask them... Tell them-

11:34.564 --> 11:38.312
Tell them he's on his way.
I'll finish up here. Priorities, Peter.

11:39.110 --> 11:40.485
Someone paged me.

11:40.653 --> 11:42.480
Dr. Corday, Dr. Morgenstern.

11:42.697 --> 11:45.449
Multiple GSWs to the chest
and abdomen.

11:45.659 --> 11:48.944
Storeowner in his 70s.
Shot with a small-caliber firearm.

11:49.162 --> 11:52.993
BP 70 palp. Pulse ox falling,
92 on 15 liters.

11:53.207 --> 11:54.488
His name's Won Sok Jang.

11:54.668 --> 11:55.995
- Transport time?
-20 minutes.

11:56.169 --> 11:59.086
- Any relatives to give consent?
- No.

11:59.464 --> 12:02.086
He's a perfect candidate.
Get me 4 units HemoAid.

12:02.259 --> 12:03.539
He's getting cyanotic.

12:03.719 --> 12:05.130
Muffled heart sounds.

12:05.346 --> 12:08.429
Neck vein distension.
Probable pericardial tamponade.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.803
- Shall I?
- I've got it.

12:10.017 --> 12:14.097
Pericardiocentesis tray.
Stick an alligator clamp on that V-1 lead.

12:14.313 --> 12:15.688
BP's down to 40 palp.

12:19.235 --> 12:21.144
Worked hard his whole life for this.

12:21.320 --> 12:22.696
Pulse ox, 88.

12:22.863 --> 12:23.894
He's bradying down.

12:29.787 --> 12:30.818
David?

12:31.330 --> 12:33.952
- Rate's 30.
- David?

12:40.131 --> 12:41.923
I'm losing a pulse.

12:46.096 --> 12:48.765
Sorry. I've got something in my eye.

12:48.932 --> 12:50.130
Could you?

12:57.399 --> 12:58.774
Got it.

13:00.569 --> 13:05.836
- Who the hell was that?
- Our Chief of Emergency Medicine.

13:11.105 --> 13:13.598
Hey, nurse, I was called down
for a rule-out appy.

13:13.777 --> 13:14.940
Dr. Carter is in Exam 3.

13:15.111 --> 13:18.364
- What are you doing with those?
- Taking them to Dr. Corday.

13:23.834 --> 13:25.163
Lizzie, what are you doing?

13:25.378 --> 13:27.787
- Dr. Romano?
- I didn't authorize HemoAid in the ER.

13:28.133 --> 13:30.423
I tried to tell you,
I moved ahead with a study.

13:30.595 --> 13:31.840
- Got a rhythm.
- Faint pulse.

13:32.014 --> 13:33.046
Who said you could?

13:33.433 --> 13:35.557
Dr. Greene signed on
as my faculty advisor.

13:36.647 --> 13:37.726
I see.

13:38.899 --> 13:39.932
I'd like to explain.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.142
Let's repeat a crit.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.733
I haven't moved my office.

13:47.664 --> 13:49.374
I feel a lot better now.

13:50.211 --> 13:52.668
That's because we rehydrated you.

13:52.839 --> 13:58.182
But with hyperemesis gravidarum, the
vomiting could continue or get worse.

13:59.016 --> 14:00.511
I can handle it.

14:01.311 --> 14:04.765
Your labs indicate that your
kidneys aren't functioning properly.

14:05.652 --> 14:09.735
And you have a low potassium level,
which could cause cardiac arrhythmia.

14:10.993 --> 14:15.458
I don't know what Dave said to you,
but I'm not giving up this baby.

14:15.667 --> 14:17.413
I'm not suggesting that.

14:17.588 --> 14:20.591
But there are drugs available
which could reduce the vomiting.

14:21.678 --> 14:24.883
But my OB said that drugs
could put my baby at risk.

14:26.269 --> 14:28.013
There is that possibility.

14:28.439 --> 14:31.975
But endangering your health
also puts your baby at risk.

14:34.073 --> 14:36.566
I'm sure you'll make a great mother.

14:36.744 --> 14:40.744
But physically, you might not be able to
be one without medical intervention.

14:42.378 --> 14:43.754
Would you take the drugs?

14:44.841 --> 14:46.418
Yes, I would.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.800
I can't.

14:50.725 --> 14:52.220
Think about it.

14:53.271 --> 14:57.853
If your condition worsens,
your life could be at risk.

15:02.952 --> 15:05.161
Hey, Doug, you ever been
to Hog Head McDunna's?

15:05.332 --> 15:08.121
Great taco bar.
I'll have to take a rain check on tonight.

15:08.295 --> 15:09.838
Listen, Carol can come along.

15:10.006 --> 15:12.000
Dr. Ross, Anspaugh's on the phone.

15:12.176 --> 15:14.134
Okay. I still need to talk to you.

15:14.305 --> 15:15.800
All right.

15:17.226 --> 15:20.182
We'll need a record of his vitals
after every bag was hung.

15:20.690 --> 15:24.227
Dr. Corday, this is Lindsey Jang.

15:24.446 --> 15:26.071
He is your patient's son.

15:26.282 --> 15:29.202
I'm sorry. I wasn't aware
any relatives had arrived.

15:29.413 --> 15:30.789
How's my father?

15:30.999 --> 15:34.915
He's been taken to surgery. His heart
stopped, but we resuscitated him.

15:35.088 --> 15:37.166
Did it stop because
you gave him fake blood?

15:38.927 --> 15:39.959
No.

15:40.388 --> 15:43.059
In fact, he responded quite well.

15:43.268 --> 15:47.814
One of the benefits of HemoAid is it can
transport oxygen to areas where-

15:47.984 --> 15:50.144
- Who gave you permission?
- I've got a consult.

15:50.321 --> 15:51.781
Good luck, Mr. Jang. Lizzie.

15:56.373 --> 15:59.459
Mr. Jang, we did use an
experimental product on your father.

15:59.670 --> 16:01.463
But it was intended to help him.

16:01.673 --> 16:04.427
Here is some literature
explaining the protocol.

16:04.595 --> 16:06.089
He should've gotten real blood.

16:06.639 --> 16:08.135
He did. If you'd just read-

16:08.309 --> 16:09.969
I don't care about your study!

16:10.144 --> 16:14.015
If he dies,
I'm holding you responsible.

16:18.658 --> 16:20.949
Hey, buddy. How you feeling?

16:21.205 --> 16:22.534
A little better.

16:22.707 --> 16:24.617
Can I talk to you outside
for a second?

16:24.794 --> 16:25.873
Yeah.

16:26.045 --> 16:27.624
I wanna hear.

16:29.302 --> 16:30.713
Okay.

16:31.138 --> 16:35.553
Okay. All right. Your labs indicate
that you're pancytopenic.

16:35.728 --> 16:38.648
- You have low blood cell counts.
- Well, how low?

16:38.817 --> 16:41.190
Tap the bone marrow,
see if it's producing cells.

16:41.363 --> 16:44.401
You'll have to get transfusions
and be put in an isolation room.

16:44.576 --> 16:46.950
You know, Doug,
maybe we should talk outside.

16:47.122 --> 16:49.364
Yeah. We'll be back.

16:51.587 --> 16:53.665
A bone-marrow biopsy?
He could have the flu.

16:53.841 --> 16:55.751
Wouldn't lower his white cell count.

16:55.927 --> 16:58.764
His counts probably haven't come back
because of the chemo.

16:58.932 --> 17:00.559
Jeanie, he needs the biopsy.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.564
I've seen Scott at his worst.
I'm sure Anspaugh would agree.

17:03.732 --> 17:07.684
Dr. Anspaugh, I already talked to.
And he said to move forward.

17:08.907 --> 17:12.742
Okay. I'll set up Exam 4 for isolation.

17:12.955 --> 17:16.492
- About Scott's pain...
- I'll take care of it.

17:18.046 --> 17:20.718
- Natalie Logan.
- Off with one hat, on with the other.

17:20.885 --> 17:23.045
Yosh. Can you cover me
at the clinic tomorrow?

17:23.222 --> 17:24.598
- Sure. Count me in.
- Great.

17:24.767 --> 17:26.806
- Nurse Hathaway.
- Hi, Natalie.

17:26.978 --> 17:29.102
- Does your dad wanna come back?
- That's okay.

17:29.273 --> 17:30.353
It's not a problem.

17:30.525 --> 17:32.485
Mark, have you seen David Morgenstern?

17:32.654 --> 17:33.816
No. And I'd rather not.

17:34.030 --> 17:35.942
He just spent an hour
with my patient...

17:36.118 --> 17:38.741
...talking about her collection
of antique creamers.

17:38.914 --> 17:41.121
He might have come back to work
a little early.

17:41.334 --> 17:44.837
Oh, we need to discuss this Doug Ross
situation at some point.

17:45.049 --> 17:46.164
What situation?

17:46.385 --> 17:49.055
Well, it sounds like
he's not coming back next year.

17:50.683 --> 17:53.175
Does your father know
you're here for birth control?

17:53.354 --> 17:55.015
Not exactly.

17:55.191 --> 17:56.899
You won't tell him, will you?

17:57.109 --> 17:58.771
Not if you don't want me to.

17:58.946 --> 18:02.115
How have your periods been since
your last progesterone injection?

18:02.285 --> 18:03.661
Light.

18:04.288 --> 18:08.159
Any pain, leg cramps, visual changes,
weight gain?

18:08.921 --> 18:11.959
Are you using condoms to prevent
sexually transmitted disease?

18:12.176 --> 18:14.384
Sometimes my boyfriend forgets.

18:14.555 --> 18:16.300
It's your responsibility too.

18:16.517 --> 18:18.426
- Yeah, I know.
- All right.

18:18.603 --> 18:22.769
Here's your follow-up reminder.
Have you come back in three months.

18:23.361 --> 18:25.983
And here are some condoms. Use them.

18:26.198 --> 18:29.866
- I will. Thank you.
- Okay. Bye.

18:30.915 --> 18:33.407
John? You never returned
my call last night.

18:33.585 --> 18:35.710
Sorry. I need to get
a new answering machine.

18:35.881 --> 18:38.374
You also need sleep.
You look like the walking dead.

18:38.552 --> 18:40.878
It's insomnia.
I get it every once in a while.

18:41.097 --> 18:42.973
Try this for a quick fix.

18:43.143 --> 18:44.223
Doctor?

18:44.395 --> 18:46.436
Just wanted to say thanks for nothing.

18:46.816 --> 18:49.307
I'm sorry, Mr. Fearn.
But your wife's not ready to-

18:49.528 --> 18:51.273
Save it for your priest, okay?

18:51.824 --> 18:54.151
When I saw your name,
I should've asked for someone else.

18:54.328 --> 18:55.989
- My name?
- You're Catholic, right?

18:56.164 --> 18:57.362
So?

18:57.541 --> 19:00.460
You get points for putting
a baby's life ahead of my wife's?

19:00.629 --> 19:02.255
- Excuse me.
- No, no, no.

19:02.425 --> 19:06.923
I am Catholic. And I'm Italian.
And I'm a woman.

19:07.099 --> 19:08.843
And I'm a doctor.

19:09.394 --> 19:12.895
And I have done everything in my power
to help your wife and your child.

19:13.108 --> 19:14.484
Dave.

19:15.571 --> 19:19.653
Listen, be patient.
Let her make her decision.

19:29.050 --> 19:31.674
What's this I hear about you
not coming back next year?

19:31.847 --> 19:33.722
- Leave it to Weaver.
- So it's true?

19:33.891 --> 19:36.431
I tried to tell you.
I'm not renewing my fellowship...

19:36.604 --> 19:39.098
...because I'm applying
for an Attending position.

19:39.610 --> 19:41.069
I can't be a Fellow forever.

19:41.279 --> 19:43.950
I don't know. You were on your way
to convincing me.

19:44.158 --> 19:48.075
The problem is County General doesn't
have a Pedes ER Attending position.

19:48.248 --> 19:49.494
Maybe it should.

19:49.667 --> 19:53.668
A third of the cases that come in are
pediatric but nobody's overseeing it.

19:53.841 --> 19:54.957
I wouldn't go that far.

19:55.135 --> 19:57.805
So a Pediatric Attending
would increase the care, right?

19:57.972 --> 20:00.761
- So you're serious?
- Doug, we're ready for that biopsy.

20:00.935 --> 20:02.681
You back me up.

20:04.691 --> 20:07.564
Elizabeth, I hear you got your first
HemoAid candidate.

20:07.739 --> 20:10.112
Yeah. And lost him again.
No thanks to Dr. Romano.

20:10.284 --> 20:12.657
- What'd he do?
- That's not important.

20:12.871 --> 20:14.700
What can I say, he's a jerk.

20:14.875 --> 20:17.284
Actually, that was perfectly put.

20:17.671 --> 20:20.626
Don't let him get to you.
And if you need a backup, call me.

20:20.801 --> 20:22.261
Thanks.

20:23.264 --> 20:25.554
- Damn it!
- Peter, what's wrong?

20:26.102 --> 20:29.555
Reece has a fever. I've gotta get him
to Carla's and my car won't start.

20:29.732 --> 20:31.525
Plus I've got an ileectomy scheduled.

20:31.693 --> 20:33.771
Well, I could take him.
My car's here.

20:33.990 --> 20:37.194
You know, I don't think that would
be a good idea. Come on, Reece.

20:37.411 --> 20:38.741
I'm a good driver, Peter.

20:38.956 --> 20:41.495
Yeah, I know. I just think
it would be awkward.

20:41.710 --> 20:44.629
Fine. You drive and I'll
keep this little one company.

20:44.798 --> 20:46.377
Hello, sweetheart.

20:46.551 --> 20:49.922
All right, we could just make it.
Go get your coat.

20:50.098 --> 20:51.474
Okay.

20:54.773 --> 20:58.274
- Are you looking for a student?
- No. I see him. Thank you.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.407
- Bull's eye.
- Kerry.

21:07.793 --> 21:11.580
It's not wise to sneak up on a man
when he's got a needle in his hand.

21:11.800 --> 21:14.043
I wanted to check on your eye.

21:14.638 --> 21:17.392
Much better, thank you.
Saline did the trick.

21:19.188 --> 21:23.104
After six months, I figured it couldn't
hurt to brush up on my anatomy.

21:23.277 --> 21:26.447
Well, everyone can benefit
from that on occasion.

21:27.200 --> 21:30.322
Do you ever think about patients
when you work on them?

21:30.539 --> 21:33.210
You know, their hopes, their dreams?

21:34.505 --> 21:37.459
Honestly, no.

21:38.552 --> 21:40.131
I never did.

21:41.140 --> 21:44.926
But in that trauma room all I could
think about was that old grocer's life...

21:45.104 --> 21:48.107
...and how he was relying on me.

21:50.238 --> 21:53.240
I don't know if you heard,
but last month...

21:53.451 --> 21:57.404
...I suffered a grand mal seizure
during a HAZMAT incident-

21:57.583 --> 21:59.410
- Then you know.
- Know what?

21:59.961 --> 22:04.591
About perspective,
about looking at the big picture.

22:04.803 --> 22:07.010
I know that the big picture
can be humbling...

22:07.223 --> 22:12.221
...maybe even destructive to one's focus
and sense of confidence.

22:14.277 --> 22:15.439
Nonsense.

22:16.906 --> 22:21.451
Kerry Weaver, meet John DeLeo,
welder, father of five.

22:21.663 --> 22:25.450
Never retired despite crippling arthritis,
outlived three of his kids...

22:25.629 --> 22:27.123
...never left Chicago.

22:27.298 --> 22:29.090
You know all that about this cadaver?

22:30.386 --> 22:31.881
No. I made it up.

22:34.017 --> 22:37.222
But if I did know,
it wouldn't make me less focused.

22:37.982 --> 22:39.856
It would make me a better doctor.

22:43.406 --> 22:45.317
You're almost there.

22:46.037 --> 22:47.995
Crux of the climb.

22:48.749 --> 22:50.743
Just a few hundred feet to go.

22:50.919 --> 22:54.291
Your fingers search across the rock
till you find the perfect handhold.

22:54.466 --> 22:56.176
You feel it?

22:56.679 --> 22:58.009
I've got it.

22:59.599 --> 23:00.846
Okay, Scott.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.977
I'm gonna put the needle in now,
buddy. Okay?

23:05.360 --> 23:06.688
Okay.

23:06.861 --> 23:09.354
All you gotta do is
just hold on and breathe.

23:09.575 --> 23:12.697
You're almost there.
You're almost to the top.

23:14.540 --> 23:16.998
Okay, I got you.
It's okay, Scott. Hang on.

23:19.716 --> 23:21.341
Hold on.

23:24.307 --> 23:28.093
After the E light comes on, I have
almost a day's worth of petrol left.

23:28.314 --> 23:32.147
I'm not gonna risk running out of gas
in the middle of Garfield Park.

23:32.779 --> 23:36.150
For your sake, I hope you don't inherit
your father's stubbornness.

23:39.957 --> 23:42.876
When we get to Carla's restaurant,
I'm gonna run in.

23:43.045 --> 23:45.882
So you don't mind
waiting out in the car, do you?

23:46.467 --> 23:48.426
Are you still in love with her? Carla?

23:48.596 --> 23:50.506
It was never love.

23:50.683 --> 23:53.175
But you're worried about her
seeing us together.

23:53.479 --> 23:56.150
- I'm not worried.
- Is it because I'm white?

23:56.985 --> 23:58.230
Excuse me?

23:58.403 --> 24:01.525
Well, we spend time together.
There's a chemistry.

24:01.701 --> 24:03.694
But there's an obstacle.
Is it racial?

24:04.372 --> 24:07.208
Elizabeth, I don't even know
how to respond to that.

24:07.585 --> 24:08.914
Damn it!

24:09.422 --> 24:11.748
- Are you okay? Reece?
- Yeah, we're fine.

24:11.967 --> 24:13.000
Damn it!

24:15.723 --> 24:17.598
Oh, my God!
Okay, here we go.

24:17.769 --> 24:19.846
Elizabeth, call 911.

24:20.481 --> 24:22.439
Hold on. Hold on. Here we go.

24:25.448 --> 24:28.119
- What do you got?
- Auto versus pedestrian.

24:28.411 --> 24:31.199
- BP's okay.
- Dr. Corday?

24:31.415 --> 24:33.872
Yes, we got involved
in a bit of an accident.

24:34.044 --> 24:35.706
- We're here, Miss Ingram.
- Finally.

24:35.881 --> 24:38.289
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Dr. Benton's involved as well.

24:38.468 --> 24:40.177
Involved? He ran into me.

24:40.347 --> 24:41.379
Reece was with him.

24:41.557 --> 24:43.681
I was at lunch.
I need to call my boss.

24:43.894 --> 24:45.305
- Peter, you okay?
- Yeah.

24:45.522 --> 24:47.349
- Let me get it.
- No. I got it. Come on.

24:51.156 --> 24:54.111
Pulse is 160. Resps 32.

24:54.285 --> 24:56.826
He cried after it happened.
Now he's become somnolent.

24:56.999 --> 24:59.076
- What happened?
- I backed into a pedestrian.

24:59.252 --> 25:01.246
I think he's okay.
He was in his car seat.

25:01.422 --> 25:02.917
All right. We'll check him out.

25:03.217 --> 25:05.045
- Anna, can you take a look?
- Of course.

25:05.221 --> 25:06.335
How's the pedestrian?

25:06.514 --> 25:08.139
Don't worry. She's in good hands.

25:08.308 --> 25:10.635
- He feels warm.
- He had a fever earlier.

25:10.854 --> 25:11.934
Hey, little fella-

25:12.106 --> 25:14.729
No, no. Get a CT of his head,
neck and abdomen first.

25:15.194 --> 25:17.105
Peter, let me look at that head lac?

25:17.282 --> 25:19.441
- Let Anna check out Reece.
- No. I'm fine.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.031
Peter, go with him.

25:21.205 --> 25:22.580
It's fine.

25:23.708 --> 25:26.165
Let's get a CBC,
type and cross for four.

25:26.337 --> 25:29.127
Let's get a chest and a pelvis.
Dip a urine for blood.

25:29.342 --> 25:31.835
- I have to get to work.
- Someone's calling your boss.

25:32.013 --> 25:33.841
Harbilas and Kleiderman Law Offices.

25:34.058 --> 25:35.174
Yeah. We got it.

25:35.812 --> 25:36.844
How is she?

25:37.022 --> 25:39.311
Superficial lacs,
contusions and abrasions.

25:39.484 --> 25:40.516
Pulse ox, 99.

25:40.694 --> 25:43.781
I checked her in the ambulance.
Her abdomen's benign.

25:44.033 --> 25:45.148
- Does this hurt?
- Yes!

25:45.326 --> 25:48.330
You were more worried about your kid
than where you were going.

25:48.499 --> 25:49.874
I tried to explain that you-

25:50.042 --> 25:52.536
- Peritoneal lavage tray.
- Not necessary.

25:53.046 --> 25:55.291
Peter, you shouldn't be in here.
Come on.

25:55.510 --> 25:57.753
- Has the trauma team been paged?
- Peter.

25:57.972 --> 26:00.891
- Come on.
- Do it.

26:01.936 --> 26:05.557
- I should go check on Reece.
- Anna's taking care of him. Sit down.

26:06.069 --> 26:09.320
- Did you lose consciousness?
- No. No. I was barely moving.

26:10.617 --> 26:12.576
Well, it doesn't need sutures.

26:12.788 --> 26:14.996
I never saw her.
She was in my blind spot.

26:15.209 --> 26:17.961
Well, don't beat yourself up.
It was an accident.

26:18.171 --> 26:19.631
Damn it! I'm missing surgery.

26:19.799 --> 26:21.259
Hey, Peter, Reece is fine.

26:21.468 --> 26:23.343
- Did you get a CT?
- Not necessary.

26:23.555 --> 26:26.973
Normal fundi. He's interactive.
Malik's giving him a bottle.

26:27.186 --> 26:28.267
- Thanks, Anna.
- Sure.

26:28.439 --> 26:29.933
Stay still.

26:30.108 --> 26:31.271
- Romano.
- Hold on.

26:31.651 --> 26:33.526
Stay still.

26:33.989 --> 26:35.484
Okay.

26:36.201 --> 26:37.577
Dr. Romano!

26:37.745 --> 26:40.368
Where have you been?
Brin's screaming bloody murder.

26:40.541 --> 26:41.870
I was in a car accident.

26:42.043 --> 26:43.836
Why were you out
when you had surgery?

26:44.006 --> 26:47.008
Dr. Romano, I'm afraid Peter
brought you down here for nothing.

26:47.177 --> 26:49.217
- Surgical consults for your victim?
- Yes.

26:49.514 --> 26:51.425
Let's see what damage
you've wrought.

26:51.768 --> 26:53.559
What did you tell that woman
about me?

26:53.770 --> 26:56.180
In the ambulance,
she wanted to know what happened.

26:56.400 --> 26:57.776
She works for a damn lawyer.

26:57.944 --> 27:01.196
Dr. Benton, these two would like to
question you about the accident.

27:04.038 --> 27:05.580
- Hi, Jeanie.
- Hello.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.619
Doug told me about
Dr. Anspaugh's son.

27:07.836 --> 27:09.627
- How's he doing?
- He's holding up.

27:09.838 --> 27:14.302
I opened the clinic so the staff can
get tested as possible marrow donors.

27:14.471 --> 27:17.473
Jerry's e-mailed the other floors
and Anna's making up flyers.

27:17.642 --> 27:18.924
It's a nice gesture, Carol.

27:19.104 --> 27:21.941
I know it's hard to find a match.
But people want to help.

27:22.109 --> 27:23.901
I appreciate it. It's just premature.

27:24.070 --> 27:28.366
His biopsy results aren't even back yet.
Let's give the kid a chance, you know?

27:31.207 --> 27:33.330
Now, the pump is computerized.

27:33.501 --> 27:37.372
It'll release the exact amount of pain
medicine whenever you push the button.

27:37.550 --> 27:39.627
So you're calling the shots, all right?

27:39.845 --> 27:41.839
Can I OD if I press this too much?

27:42.057 --> 27:45.013
It's programmed to lock out
so that won't happen.

27:46.565 --> 27:48.356
All right. Be back.

27:49.903 --> 27:52.064
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

27:52.240 --> 27:55.327
Anspaugh called. He's concerned
about putting Scott on PCA.

27:55.538 --> 27:57.947
- He called you?
- He wanted to know the ER's policy.

27:58.125 --> 28:02.041
I told him we didn't have one.
I was unaware you used PCA on kids.

28:02.215 --> 28:03.876
- Well, I am.
- You should've told me.

28:04.051 --> 28:05.630
Didn't know I needed permission.

28:05.804 --> 28:08.344
- Keep me informed.
- Would you have told me not to?

28:08.559 --> 28:10.932
I'm not asking you to answer to me.
Just speak up.

28:11.230 --> 28:13.057
This is why we need a Pedes Attending.

28:13.274 --> 28:15.150
I'll talk to Anspaugh.
If that's okay?

28:27.298 --> 28:30.503
- What'd Romano say about her belly?
- He agreed. It's benign.

28:30.678 --> 28:32.967
- And her labs?
- They're not back yet.

28:33.515 --> 28:35.308
You gotta stay on top of this one.

28:35.519 --> 28:40.978
Scary, isn't it? I mean, one mistake
and your life changes just like that.

28:41.153 --> 28:42.565
Has she had other complaints?

28:42.781 --> 28:45.653
Yeah, she's got a headache.
But I don't think it's anything.

28:45.869 --> 28:47.992
All right. Order a CT.

28:48.205 --> 28:50.829
- A CT?
- Yeah. Just do it, okay?

28:51.170 --> 28:55.003
- No, no. He's been a real trouper.
- That's my good boy.

28:55.801 --> 28:57.345
Peter, there you are.

28:57.554 --> 29:01.769
It's just a minor accident. Come on.
Come on. He's fine.

29:01.937 --> 29:04.511
- What about you?
- It's not as bad as it looks.

29:04.733 --> 29:06.977
I was getting gas.
And then all of a sudden-

29:07.196 --> 29:09.948
- Yes. Elizabeth filled me in.
- Just the highlights.

29:10.951 --> 29:14.323
Well, I should really
be getting Reece home.

29:14.499 --> 29:16.208
Thanks again for taking care of him.

29:16.377 --> 29:18.370
You're welcome.
You feel better now, Reece.

29:18.589 --> 29:21.545
Hey. Call me if he becomes
irritable or lethargic, okay?

29:21.719 --> 29:25.055
- I will. I will.
- All right. See you.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.558
She takes things in her stride.

29:27.728 --> 29:29.390
Like what?

29:30.191 --> 29:32.730
Peter, you've just got to relax.

29:32.945 --> 29:35.698
If I had taken the El
or waited for that taxi...

29:35.866 --> 29:38.360
...or got my car fixed,
this wouldn't have happened.

29:38.538 --> 29:41.291
You mean, if only I hadn't
got involved. That's it.

29:42.878 --> 29:44.539
Elizabeth, I didn't say that.

29:44.756 --> 29:46.715
No. You didn't have to.

29:47.845 --> 29:50.384
Diagnosis: too many bologna
and cheese sandwiches.

29:50.599 --> 29:52.842
And too many hours
in front of video games.

29:53.061 --> 29:54.391
- Fleets enema?
- Yeah.

29:54.564 --> 29:57.685
And the number of the local
Cub Scout pack. Boys need activities.

29:57.902 --> 30:00.525
Stay fit, make friends, have fun,
all at the same time.

30:00.740 --> 30:02.782
- You came back.
- Why wouldn't I?

30:02.995 --> 30:06.199
- Dr. Weaver, I'm losing a pulse on Plazik!
- What's his history?

30:06.375 --> 30:09.663
Presented with pyloric stenosis
secondary to chronic ulcer disease.

30:09.839 --> 30:12.247
Ate a big lunch followed by
bad heartburn.

30:12.467 --> 30:15.506
- He take any meds?
- Just bicarb. Baking soda.

30:15.723 --> 30:18.761
- He's bradying down.
- Probably vasovagal.

30:18.936 --> 30:21.394
Do you think his stomach is distending?

30:23.569 --> 30:24.601
Damn!

30:25.781 --> 30:28.949
- Esophageal strictures.
- Here. David, let me try.

30:31.123 --> 30:33.794
No. I can't get it either.

30:34.712 --> 30:36.041
Get me an 18-gauge needle.

30:36.214 --> 30:38.589
- And a syringe.
- What are you doing?

30:38.761 --> 30:41.169
We gotta decompress him,
or he's gonna explode.

30:41.389 --> 30:42.719
Are you sure?

30:50.279 --> 30:51.857
Pulse is coming back.

30:52.532 --> 30:54.657
Excellent work, doctor.

30:59.126 --> 31:01.370
- Thanks for doing this, Mark.
- Thank you.

31:01.548 --> 31:03.873
The bone-marrow drive
is a great idea.

31:04.051 --> 31:06.674
I'm glad you and Doug
are going out tonight.

31:06.847 --> 31:09.055
What do you mean?
He canceled on me.

31:09.227 --> 31:12.312
You're kidding.
I told him we could cancel tonight.

31:12.815 --> 31:14.145
Excuse me.

31:14.568 --> 31:17.144
Natalie? Is there a problem?

31:17.365 --> 31:20.569
- Are you "C. Hathaway, R.N. "?
- That's me.

31:20.745 --> 31:22.655
I'm Natalie's mother, Abbey Logan.

31:23.207 --> 31:26.080
I found your clinic follow-up note...

31:26.255 --> 31:29.257
...along with these.

31:32.890 --> 31:35.464
Natalie won't talk to me.
So I thought you might.

31:35.685 --> 31:39.733
Confidentiality laws prevent me from
discussing Natalie's medical history.

31:39.943 --> 31:42.779
- I just want to know what's going on.
- I understand that.

31:43.907 --> 31:46.614
Maybe I can answer some questions
for Natalie in private.

31:46.787 --> 31:48.828
She might be more willing
to discuss this.

31:49.041 --> 31:51.117
- Whatever you can do.
- Okay. Come on.

32:00.726 --> 32:02.886
Lizzie, Lizzie, Lizzie.

32:03.815 --> 32:06.686
I had no idea how much you wanted
your own piece of the pie.

32:06.861 --> 32:08.689
I didn't intend to
go behind your back.

32:08.865 --> 32:10.657
Never apologize for being ambitious.

32:10.868 --> 32:15.033
I just wish you'd spend your time
on a study that was more respectable.

32:16.043 --> 32:17.586
Respectable?

32:17.755 --> 32:20.792
Foisting substitute blood
on hapless John Does in the ER.

32:20.967 --> 32:24.173
And without consent, it's a bit
morally ambiguous, don't you think?

32:24.390 --> 32:26.965
- So you're concerned for my soul.
- Among other things.

32:27.143 --> 32:31.014
How'd you like to become the Chicago
coordinator for the HemoAid O.R. study?

32:31.944 --> 32:33.356
You are joking.

32:33.530 --> 32:37.114
Drug company's expanding the science
and they've asked me to oversee it.

32:37.578 --> 32:40.949
Join me, you'll leap up the ladder
from worker bee to queen bee.

32:43.503 --> 32:44.703
It's a generous offer.

32:44.881 --> 32:47.374
Is it contingent on me
dropping my ER study?

32:47.552 --> 32:49.511
I can't imagine you'd
have time for both.

32:51.851 --> 32:53.394
Think about it.

32:56.693 --> 32:58.602
Your parents obviously care.

32:58.903 --> 33:03.569
Trust me.
This would seriously flip them out.

33:03.787 --> 33:06.457
It may reassure them
to know you're being responsible...

33:06.624 --> 33:08.168
...about birth control and STDs.

33:08.336 --> 33:10.164
But you're not gonna tell them, right?

33:11.090 --> 33:14.710
- I can't tell them. And I won't.
- Okay.

33:14.888 --> 33:19.102
But sometimes it's worse when
you shut out the people who care.

33:19.270 --> 33:23.056
And your mother is concerned.
Your father brought you here.

33:25.572 --> 33:27.198
That wasn't my father.

33:28.869 --> 33:31.706
That man who you
saw me with earlier...

33:32.918 --> 33:34.662
...he's my teacher.

33:38.217 --> 33:40.461
Natalie, are you having sex
with your teacher?

33:40.680 --> 33:42.887
It's not like he forces me to
or anything.

33:43.058 --> 33:45.729
I mean, we really love each other,
you know?

33:46.439 --> 33:48.647
But we keep it quiet.
If Jim's wife found out-

33:48.819 --> 33:49.850
He's married?

33:50.028 --> 33:52.651
Yeah. But she's real unstable,
his wife.

33:52.825 --> 33:54.403
So he can't tell her just yet.

33:54.619 --> 33:57.112
But when I'm 18,
Jim's gonna get a divorce.

33:58.124 --> 34:01.875
This teacher of yours, Jim, he's what?
About 40 years old?

34:02.047 --> 34:03.757
About that.

34:03.926 --> 34:06.002
Natalie, what he's doing is illegal.

34:06.179 --> 34:09.550
No. No. I love him.

34:09.768 --> 34:11.597
And he loves me. It's simple.

34:12.357 --> 34:14.728
No. It's definitely not simple.

34:22.163 --> 34:23.574
Biopsy results came in.

34:23.750 --> 34:25.873
- And?
- Cancer's back.

34:27.214 --> 34:28.590
How bad?

34:29.007 --> 34:32.545
Lymphomas in the bone marrow.
That's why he was so anemic.

34:35.060 --> 34:37.183
I told him it was all behind him.

34:38.231 --> 34:40.391
He made it through before.
He can do it again.

34:40.569 --> 34:43.143
- This means bone-marrow transplant.
- And more chemo.

34:43.324 --> 34:46.444
He'll have to be isolated because
of a greater risk of infection.

34:46.661 --> 34:49.284
I did contact
the National Bone Marrow Registry.

34:49.500 --> 34:52.039
His father or his sister could match.

34:52.379 --> 34:53.708
Does he know yet?

34:53.880 --> 34:55.840
No. I was about to go tell him.

34:56.052 --> 34:58.674
His dad's with him.
I thought you'd like to come along.

34:58.848 --> 35:02.515
No. I think they should have
some time alone. I'll be by later.

35:05.776 --> 35:08.066
All right. Sorry.

35:16.626 --> 35:21.126
Well, Mr. Jang, it looks like you've
made it through with flying colors.

35:21.467 --> 35:23.462
He doesn't understand English
very well.

35:23.638 --> 35:26.475
I just wanted to see
how he was doing.

35:33.320 --> 35:36.489
My father wants to thank you
for helping save his life.

35:37.118 --> 35:38.399
You're very welcome.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.661
I told him about your blood study.

35:43.838 --> 35:46.412
And even though I still
have reservations...

35:46.884 --> 35:48.545
...he'd like to know more about it.

35:48.720 --> 35:51.095
Well, certainly.
With your help, of course.

35:53.979 --> 35:55.640
Should you be here?

35:55.857 --> 35:57.685
So how are you feeling?

35:57.861 --> 36:00.020
Better. I'd like to go home now.

36:00.238 --> 36:02.197
As soon as we're sure you're fine.

36:02.368 --> 36:03.828
Your CT came back negative.

36:04.038 --> 36:08.452
But these labs indicate
an elevated amylase and lipase.

36:09.003 --> 36:10.035
Dr. Benton.

36:10.214 --> 36:13.382
Carter, you missed something
in Miss Ingram's labs.

36:13.720 --> 36:16.722
This level indicates a pancreatic injury.

36:16.932 --> 36:18.345
No.

36:19.270 --> 36:20.469
You missed something.

36:21.232 --> 36:24.187
- B.A.L.?
- Point-one-six.

36:24.403 --> 36:27.692
Did you consume any alcoholic
beverages during your lunch break?

36:32.082 --> 36:35.252
Great news: Mr. Jang's decided
to remain in my study.

36:35.463 --> 36:38.584
That's terrific. I guess you won't
need help from me after all.

36:38.760 --> 36:42.096
Actually, I'll still need your support
if I'm to make a go of this.

36:42.266 --> 36:45.470
- You having second thoughts?
- No. No. I'm staying put.

36:45.687 --> 36:49.605
It may not be the smartest move,
but it feels like the thing to do.

36:57.290 --> 36:59.912
Are you behind this marrow drive?
I'm very touched.

37:00.127 --> 37:02.454
Actually, it was
Carol Hathaway's idea.

37:02.715 --> 37:04.341
How did Scott take the news?

37:04.551 --> 37:07.223
That boy continues to surprise me.

37:07.556 --> 37:09.930
He is determined to beat this thing.

37:10.144 --> 37:12.815
He has a spirit I haven't seen before.

37:14.318 --> 37:16.607
Have you told Scott
about your health status?

37:16.779 --> 37:18.191
No. Of course not.

37:18.408 --> 37:19.867
I didn't think so.

37:20.327 --> 37:22.286
Somehow he senses something.

37:23.165 --> 37:26.002
Respects you as a kindred spirit.

37:27.923 --> 37:30.961
Anyway, I know he's eager to see you.

37:31.678 --> 37:35.015
I wonder how many donors actually
match for a bone-marrow transplant?

37:35.185 --> 37:37.013
I heard less than 1 percent.

37:37.188 --> 37:40.107
I guess I won't wait by the phone.

37:40.317 --> 37:41.861
How's Chase?

37:42.071 --> 37:44.908
Still pretty early. You know Chase.

37:45.118 --> 37:46.696
When can I visit him?

37:47.121 --> 37:49.744
You know, Kenner's kind of strict
about visitors.

37:49.959 --> 37:52.878
- I know. Tell him I said hi.
- You bet.

37:53.673 --> 37:55.252
Your turn.

37:57.053 --> 38:01.516
You know, she confided in me because
she thought her secret was safe.

38:01.727 --> 38:05.348
Providing birth control is one thing.
Sexual abuse is something else.

38:05.567 --> 38:08.403
I hope it won't scare other kids
from coming to the clinic.

38:08.613 --> 38:10.406
She did the right thing coming here.

38:10.617 --> 38:12.028
This is one unique case.

38:12.203 --> 38:13.235
Well, let's hope.

38:13.413 --> 38:16.415
This guy's a 40-year-old man,
he's a teacher, he's married...

38:16.584 --> 38:18.080
...and having sex with a minor.

38:18.254 --> 38:21.376
Carol, a policewoman's asking for you.
You got a crime to report?

38:21.552 --> 38:22.881
Yeah. I'll be right there.

38:23.055 --> 38:25.593
She sobered up, and thought
twice about getting a lawyer?

38:25.766 --> 38:29.138
She said, "I wanna crawl under a rock
and pretend it never happened. "

38:29.314 --> 38:30.892
Well, she's not the only one.

38:31.108 --> 38:32.769
- You were lucky, hon.
- Peter.

38:32.945 --> 38:34.986
I thought I'd missed you.

38:37.035 --> 38:39.609
Listen, I ran into Dr. Brin.

38:39.789 --> 38:43.242
I convinced him to let me assist
on a thyroidectomy in the morning.

38:43.462 --> 38:46.334
I wanna check on Reece.
So I think we should cancel.

38:46.550 --> 38:49.125
I assumed that. I need my car keys.

38:53.061 --> 38:54.472
Thank you, Peter.

38:59.655 --> 39:02.693
It was a thrill to see you
in action again.

39:02.909 --> 39:04.951
We make a good team, you and I.

39:05.873 --> 39:09.078
I'm sorry if I was presumptive before.

39:09.253 --> 39:10.831
You're a conscientious person.

39:11.006 --> 39:13.844
It makes you a good doctor.
And a good manager.

39:14.221 --> 39:16.973
I tried to fill the void
while you were on leave.

39:17.183 --> 39:19.307
And surpassed me.

39:19.478 --> 39:23.859
Probably because of your sincere
interest in all things administrative.

39:24.069 --> 39:27.405
I never gave a damn
about the bureaucracy before.

39:27.616 --> 39:30.490
Didn't interest me then.

39:31.956 --> 39:33.417
And now?

39:34.503 --> 39:37.756
And now everything interests me.

39:41.723 --> 39:44.429
Carol, Anna, you two have plans
this evening?

39:44.645 --> 39:47.101
I did, and then I didn't,
and now I don't know.

39:47.315 --> 39:49.891
- I'm free. Why?
- Fancy a girls' night at my place?

39:50.070 --> 39:52.907
- I make a mean cosmopolitan.
- That sounds good.

39:53.117 --> 39:54.492
- Say 8:00?
- Okay.

39:58.917 --> 40:02.537
I don't know what you two are doing,
but I have plans this evening.

40:02.714 --> 40:04.091
So have fun.

40:05.720 --> 40:07.429
Together again.

40:28.298 --> 40:29.877
Jeanie.

40:32.304 --> 40:34.844
It's okay.
I've made women cry before.

40:38.648 --> 40:40.393
How you feeling?

40:40.610 --> 40:42.520
Well, this helps.

40:42.738 --> 40:45.908
Are you sure you're not being
Mr. Tough Guy like earlier?

40:47.246 --> 40:49.287
No. I really feel better.

40:49.625 --> 40:51.000
Good.

40:55.091 --> 40:57.763
My dad said that you could
come to Yosemite with us...

40:58.680 --> 41:00.426
...if you wanted to, I mean.

41:00.601 --> 41:01.765
Yeah, I'd like to.

41:03.104 --> 41:05.562
Hey, the Bone Marrow Registry...

41:06.318 --> 41:09.855
...found eight people who
preliminarily match your marrow type.

41:10.073 --> 41:13.196
Eight? That's my lucky number.

41:13.455 --> 41:16.030
We still have further matching to do,
you know?

41:16.210 --> 41:17.834
Hey, it's a start. Right?

41:18.003 --> 41:19.713
Yeah. It's a start.

41:21.843 --> 41:26.057
Seven brothers, seven sister-in-laws,
12 nieces and nephews.

41:27.477 --> 41:30.266
- Number 13 on the way.
- Oh, my God!

41:30.440 --> 41:33.063
- You're considered the family freak.
- Oh, please.

41:33.237 --> 41:36.156
My Aunt Tessa bursts into tears
every time she sees me.

41:36.743 --> 41:41.074
Well, my parents cope by treating me
like a bachelor son.

41:41.708 --> 41:43.703
Your families must be proud
of you two.

41:43.879 --> 41:45.161
Oh, sure they are.

41:45.424 --> 41:49.174
But you, Carol, have something
that I really envy.

41:50.598 --> 41:51.975
What?

41:52.602 --> 41:53.883
A sex life!

41:54.897 --> 41:55.928
Cheers to that!

41:56.817 --> 41:58.941
I have no complaints
in that department.

41:59.112 --> 42:00.489
Give us more than that.

42:00.698 --> 42:03.154
Oh, please. Please.
Let's live vicariously, please!

42:03.368 --> 42:06.241
- You wanna hear about my sex life?
- Yes! Yes!

42:06.415 --> 42:07.911
Okay. What do you wanna know?

42:08.461 --> 42:10.289
Hold that thought.
Pizza's here.

42:10.464 --> 42:12.791
- Let me get it.
- No, no. I've got it.

42:18.185 --> 42:19.810
Peter?

42:20.647 --> 42:23.222
I know I should've called first.
But I...

42:24.738 --> 42:26.065
- You're right.
- I was?

42:26.239 --> 42:28.815
Yeah. I do have a problem
dating white women.

42:29.494 --> 42:33.329
- This isn't really the time to-
- No, no, no. Listen to me.

42:34.043 --> 42:35.788
There's a lot you don't understand-

42:36.172 --> 42:39.840
Hey, Elizabeth, do you need some
more money?

42:41.972 --> 42:44.181
I didn't know you had company.

42:44.352 --> 42:46.144
- Hi, Peter.
- Bye, Peter.

42:49.860 --> 42:51.736
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

42:51.948 --> 42:54.107
Oh, no. You don't need to explain.

42:54.285 --> 42:58.534
Peter, we could do it another time
now that you know where I live.

42:58.708 --> 42:59.789
Yeah, yeah.

43:06.137 --> 43:07.514
Hey, cuz.

43:10.311 --> 43:11.687
What you watching?

43:12.856 --> 43:14.351
CNN?

43:14.734 --> 43:17.737
Anything going on in the world
that I should know about?

43:19.951 --> 43:21.945
Here. I brought you something.

43:22.747 --> 43:26.794
It's Walker Evans.
A complete retrospective of his work.

43:27.254 --> 43:29.829
I think there's a photograph
in here that you love...

43:30.301 --> 43:32.011
...if I can find it.

43:32.222 --> 43:33.764
Evening, John.

43:34.140 --> 43:35.636
Hi, Joyce.

43:36.103 --> 43:38.940
Why, Chase, look at that book
your cousin brought you.

43:47.956 --> 43:49.580
Okay, Chase.

43:51.962 --> 43:53.290
Take a sip.

43:57.428 --> 43:59.553
Oh, no! Your book!

44:01.727 --> 44:04.646
That's okay. Book's fine.

44:06.067 --> 44:07.397
Book's fine.

44:07.612 --> 44:10.319
He's been having more trouble
with that hand.

44:13.872 --> 44:15.367
There you go.

44:21.384 --> 44:23.045
Not a perfect match. But it'll do.

44:23.221 --> 44:24.715
Thanks, Joyce.

44:26.768 --> 44:28.144
There we go.

44:34.531 --> 44:36.155
You want to try it?

44:46.049 --> 44:49.235
Okay, okay. Hey, I'll do it. I'll do it.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
