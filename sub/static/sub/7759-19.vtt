11:16.209 --> 11:18.211
- I THOUGHT YOU HAD WORK
TO DO.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.914
- BUT I GOT
ALL SWEATY TOO.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.851
*

11:23.884 --> 11:26.186
- * THE POWER GRID
IS DOWN *

11:26.219 --> 11:28.055
* MELTED WIRES

11:28.088 --> 11:30.323
* AND CIRCUITS BLOWN
- BRIAN?

11:30.357 --> 11:33.160
- * CAN'T DO IT
ON MY OWN *

11:33.193 --> 11:37.130
* DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE

11:37.164 --> 11:41.068
* EVEN WHEN THE TRUTH
WILL CUT *

11:41.101 --> 11:44.872
* SO DEEPLY TO THE BONE

11:44.905 --> 11:47.474
* CAN'T DO IT
ON MY OWN *

11:47.507 --> 11:50.210
* DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE

11:50.243 --> 11:52.345
- [sighs]

11:52.379 --> 11:54.782
- * ALL OF MY OBSESSIONS

11:54.815 --> 11:59.519
* AREN'T ENOUGH
WHEN I'M ALONE *

11:59.552 --> 12:02.222
* CAN'T DO IT ON MY OWN

12:02.255 --> 12:07.227
* DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE

12:07.260 --> 12:10.197
* WANDERING IN THIS WORLD

12:10.230 --> 12:14.034
* WITH NO DIRECTION HOME

12:14.067 --> 12:16.503
* CAN'T DO IT
ON MY OWN *

12:16.536 --> 12:21.208
* DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE

12:21.241 --> 12:24.311
* TIME

12:24.344 --> 12:28.916
* CHANGES EVERYTHING

12:28.949 --> 12:31.418
* TIME

12:31.451 --> 12:35.522
* CHANGES EVERYTHING

12:35.555 --> 12:38.258
* IT'S TIME

12:38.291 --> 12:40.493
- THANK GOD
HE STARTED CRYING.

12:40.527 --> 12:41.795
- I'VE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY

12:41.829 --> 12:42.863
TO HEAR HIM SCREAM
HIS LUNGS OUT.

12:42.896 --> 12:43.997
- I MEAN,
UNFORTUNATELY,

12:44.031 --> 12:44.965
WE CAN'T COUNT ON HIM
TO SAVE US

12:44.998 --> 12:48.001
NEXT TIME SHE SHOWS UP
WANTING TO DIVE IN.

12:48.035 --> 12:50.070
- WE COULD ALWAYS PUT
A LOCK ON THE BEDROOM DOOR.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.571
- [laughs]
- I'M SERIOUS.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.573
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SET UP
SOME SORT OF BLOCKADE.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.475
- WELL, THE PROBLEM IS
SHE DOESN'T SEEM TO REALIZE

12:55.508 --> 12:56.910
IT WAS A ONE-TIME THING.

12:56.944 --> 12:57.911
- HOW COULD SHE NOT?

12:57.945 --> 12:59.813
IT WAS JUST A SPONTANEOUS,

12:59.847 --> 13:01.381
"I DON'T KNOW
HOW THE HELL IT HAPPENED,

13:01.414 --> 13:03.416
BUT THERE YOU ARE, DOING IT"
SORT OF THING.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.252
- WELL, WE JUST NEED
TO BE HONEST WITH HER.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.954
- OKAY.

13:06.987 --> 13:07.988
YOU DO IT.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.322
- ME?
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

13:09.356 --> 13:11.158
YOU WERE THERE TOO.
- I KNOW.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.192
BUT YOU'RE MUCH BETTER

13:12.225 --> 13:13.193
AT REJECTING PEOPLE
THAN I AM.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.194
- EXCUSE ME?

13:14.227 --> 13:16.897
- I MEANT THAT
IN THE HIGHEST FORM OF PRAISE.

13:16.930 --> 13:17.730
I MEAN, YOU'RE GREAT

13:17.764 --> 13:19.099
WHEN IT COMES
TO FIRING THE SITTER

13:19.132 --> 13:20.901
OR SAYING NO
TO PHONE SOLICITORS.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.435
I MEAN, HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU TOLD YOUR MOTHER

13:22.469 --> 13:23.570
SHE CAN'T COME LIVE
WITH US?

13:23.603 --> 13:25.038
- OH, SO IN OTHER WORDS,

13:25.072 --> 13:26.573
YOU'RE A TIMID LITTLE SHIKSA.
- THAT'S ME.

13:26.606 --> 13:28.208
- WELL, THIS IS
A LOT MORE DIFFICULT

13:28.241 --> 13:30.277
THAN TELLING THE SALVATION ARMY
TO TAKE A HIKE.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.244
LEDA'S A DEAR FRIEND.

13:31.278 --> 13:34.081
NOT ONLY THAT,
SHE'S DOING US A BIG FAVOR.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.548
- WAIT, THAT'S IT.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.550
THE DEAL WAS,
SHE COULD COME STAY WITH US

13:37.584 --> 13:39.352
WHILE SHE WAS WORKING
ON THE STUDIO, RIGHT?

13:39.386 --> 13:41.321
- RIGHT.

13:41.354 --> 13:44.925
- THE STUDIO'S
PRACTICALLY DONE.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.560
SO WE DON'T SAY ANYTHING,
AND IN A COUPLE OF DAYS--

13:47.594 --> 13:49.863
- OUR PROBLEM MOVES OUT
WITH HER?

13:49.897 --> 13:52.032
- YES.
PLEASE.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.001

[violin music]

13:59.606 --> 14:07.614
*

14:12.585 --> 14:15.588
- WE'LL POSTER GAYOPOLIS
A LOT FASTER IF WE SPLIT UP.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.190
I'LL GET THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE STREET.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.459
- GOOD IDEA.
- OKAY.

14:19.492 --> 14:27.434
*

14:32.672 --> 14:34.607
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

14:34.641 --> 14:36.643
- WELL, BUSINESS
IS A LITTLE SLOW,

14:36.676 --> 14:39.112
BUT AT LEAST
ONE DEVOTED FAN IS HERE.

14:39.146 --> 14:40.113
- THANKS.

14:40.147 --> 14:43.550
- NOT YOU.
BERTHA.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.452
SHE NEVER MISSES
A PERFORMANCE.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.254
- [chuckles]

14:47.287 --> 14:49.122
- WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?

14:49.156 --> 14:50.023
- POSTERS.

14:50.057 --> 14:53.994
- AH, FOR YOUR COMIC BOOK.
RAGE.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.663
- I'M HOPING TO SELL ENOUGH
TO PAY FOR TUITION NEXT YEAR.

14:56.696 --> 14:57.697
- WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.698
I HEAR THE GUYS
WHO DID X-MEN

14:58.731 --> 15:00.200
MADE A FORTUNE.
- YEAH?

15:00.233 --> 15:03.303
- HEY, YOU WANT TO GO
GET A LATTE?

15:03.336 --> 15:04.671
- I CAN'T,
I HAVE TO PUT THESE UP.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.539
- HUH.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.541
OKAY, WELL, MAYBE THIS WEEKEND
WE CAN GO SEE A MOVIE.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.577
YOU LIKE FRENCH FILMS?

15:10.610 --> 15:12.245
- I'VE NEVER BEEN TO ONE.

15:12.279 --> 15:15.148
- NEVER BEEN?
PEASANT.

15:15.182 --> 15:18.051
THE STUDENT FILM SOCIETY IS
HAVING A TRUFFAUT RETROSPECTIVE.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.053
THEY'RE SHOWING JULES ET JIM,

15:20.087 --> 15:23.056
A STORY ABOUT TWO MEN IN LOVE
WITH THE SAME WOMAN.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.725
ONLY IF YOU'LL NOTICE,
HER NAME'S NOT IN THE TITLE,

15:25.758 --> 15:27.060
WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE

15:27.094 --> 15:29.196
THAT THEY'RE IN LOVE
WITH EACH OTHER.

15:29.229 --> 15:32.265
- IT'S HARD ENOUGH
LOVING ONE PERSON.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.334
- BUT IF YOU'RE THE ONE
THE OTHER TWO ARE IN LOVE WITH,

15:34.367 --> 15:37.704
THEN YOU CAN BREAK
BOTH THEIR HEARTS.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.486
- I'LL CALL YOU
ABOUT THE WEEKEND.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.022
- SURE.
THAT'S COOL.

15:55.055 --> 16:00.127
- JULES ET JIM
OR SOMETHING.

16:00.160 --> 16:03.363
[indistinct chatter]

16:03.396 --> 16:05.365
[laughter in background]

16:07.467 --> 16:09.736
- HEY, PORN KING, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE AMID THE SERFS?

16:09.769 --> 16:11.571
- FUCK OFF.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.306
- NOW, IS THAT NICE?

16:13.340 --> 16:14.774
HERE I AM, ACTUALLY
GIVING YOU THE TIME OF DAY,

16:14.807 --> 16:15.575
AND ALL YOU CAN DO
IS LEVEL

16:15.608 --> 16:19.246
A RATHER PEDESTRIAN CURSE
AT ME.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.780
- HEY, BRIAN.
WAIT.

16:20.813 --> 16:26.619
COME HAVE A DRINK ON ME.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.688
A COUPLE OF DEWARS.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.724
- WELL, WE'RE SERIOUS TONIGHT.

16:31.758 --> 16:35.228
- THE UNTHINKABLE
HAS HAPPENED.

16:35.262 --> 16:37.497

FROM FITFUL DREAMS

"TO FIND HIMSELF TRANSFORMED

16:38.798 --> 16:41.234
IN HIS BED
INTO A GIANT VAGINA."

16:41.268 --> 16:43.570
- WORSE.

16:43.603 --> 16:46.573
I'M...

16:46.606 --> 16:49.109
IMMUNE.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.643
- TO PENICILLIN?

16:50.677 --> 16:52.379
TO CLEVER
LITERARY REFERENCES?

16:52.412 --> 16:55.348
- TO PORN.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.217
I LOOK AT IT,
AND IT HAS NO EFFECT ON ME.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.286
ZIPPO.
NADA.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.621
I TOTALLY LOST INTEREST
IN IT.

17:01.654 --> 17:04.091
AND I DIDN'T
EVEN KNOW IT.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.659
ONE DAY, SUDDENLY,
IT'S JUST GONE.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.661
- YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.
TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING--

17:08.695 --> 17:12.332
- YOU'RE NOT HELPING.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.435
I'VE SEEN ALL MY WILDEST
FANTASIES FULFILLED,

17:15.468 --> 17:17.470
LIVE AND UNCENSORED
RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES,

17:17.504 --> 17:20.607
OVER AND OVER...

17:20.640 --> 17:22.142
AND OVER.
- I GOT IT.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.643
- SO MAY--
MAYBE I NEED TO

17:23.676 --> 17:25.145
LAY OFF FOR A WHILE,
YOU KNOW,

17:25.178 --> 17:26.479
JUST GIVE IT A REST.

17:26.513 --> 17:29.782
- OR MAYBE YOU NEED
TO STOP WATCHING AND DO.

17:29.816 --> 17:32.185
- [scoffs]

17:32.219 --> 17:35.455
- WHAT'S
YOUR MOST SECRET SEXUAL FANTASY?

17:35.488 --> 17:37.424
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

17:37.457 --> 17:39.792
I'M NOT TELLING YOU THAT.
- FINE.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.661
LIVE OUT THE REMAINDER
OF YOUR DAYS

17:41.694 --> 17:44.097
CONDEMNED
TO SEXUAL PURGATORY.

17:44.131 --> 17:48.501
- ALL RIGHT.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.337
BUT IF I TELL YOU,
DO YOU PROMISE

17:50.370 --> 17:51.838
NOT TO MAKE ME FEEL
LIKE A FOOL?

17:51.871 --> 17:53.873
- THAT WOULD BE REDUNDANT.

- I MAY HAVE SERIOUSLY
UNDERESTIMATED YOU, THEODORE.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.297
- THERE YOU GO, EM.

18:17.330 --> 18:21.468
COME ON.

18:21.501 --> 18:22.569
- LOOK, LOOK!

18:22.602 --> 18:24.404
I DID IT.
I GOT THEM ALL DOWN.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.406
[chuckles]
- THE NEXT TIME, HONEY,

18:26.439 --> 18:28.408
TRY AND DO IT IN YOUR LANE.

TO YOU, MOM,

18:31.844 --> 18:35.582
THIS MATCH IS THE WORST IDEA
YOU HAVE EVER HAD.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.650
- WELL, WHAT WAS
I SUPPOSED TO DO?

18:37.684 --> 18:39.919
LET THEM GET AWAY
WITH MAKING FUN OF GAY BOWLERS?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.821
- WE DO.
- YEAH, WELL, THEY'RE COPS.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.356
THEY SHOULD BE HELD
TO A HIGHER STANDARD.

18:43.390 --> 18:45.225
- RIGHT.
- WE'RE GOING TO DO FINE.

18:45.258 --> 18:48.395
- ALL WE NEED TO DO IS PRACTICE.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.668
- YEAH,
A LITTLE MORE PRACTICE,

18:55.702 --> 18:57.670
AND I'LL BE PERFECT TOO.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.539
- YOU ACTUALLY HAVE
A LOT OF POTENTIAL, EMMETT.

18:59.572 --> 19:00.540
- FOR MANSLAUGHTER.

19:00.573 --> 19:04.444
- YOU JUST NEED TO WORK
ON YOUR FOLLOW-THROUGH.

SEE, WHEREVER YOUR HAND GOES,
THE BALL GOES.

19:06.613 --> 19:09.949
SO JUST PRETEND YOU'RE THROWING
RIGHT AT THE PINS.

AT THE PINS.

TO STAY THAT WAY.

- JUST LOOKING AFTER HIS HEALTH.

- FOR CHRIST'S SAKE,
MICHAEL.

A MOTHER HEN?

- WELL,
I GUESS I'M ON THE TEAM,

LIKES IT OR NOT.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.317

20:23.823 --> 20:26.326
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU,
CHECKING OUT THE COMPETITION?

20:26.359 --> 20:28.328
- CHECKING IT OUT
REAL CLOSELY.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.297
I LIKE WHAT I SEE.
HEY, VIC.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.264
- HEY.
- [clears throat]

20:31.298 --> 20:32.599
- LEAVE IT TO MY SISTER
TO GET US INTO THIS.

- MICHAEL,
COVER YOUR EYES.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.034
- GUESS WE MIGHT
AS WELL HAVE FUN.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.369
- HEY, YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU NEED A DRINK.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.004
- FOR ONCE,
WE CAN BE ALONE.

20:38.037 --> 20:41.874
- OH, WAIT A MINUTE.
MY KID'S STANDING RIGHT THERE.

20:41.908 --> 20:45.412
- I JUST WANNA GIVE YOU
A LITTLE KISS.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.480
HOW ABOUT WE GO OUT
FOR A DRINK?

20:47.514 --> 20:49.382
- I CAN'T, I'M MEETING
WITH THE GUYS.

FOR THE GAME.
