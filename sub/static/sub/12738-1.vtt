02:02.166 --> 02:08.874
Made of silicon...
Come to life with maze of wires...

02:09.083 --> 02:11.874
With hard disk memory...

02:13.916 --> 02:16.165
With an everlasting body...

02:16.500 --> 02:18.790
An eternal life...

02:20.125 --> 02:21.832
With integrating sixth sense...

02:22.208 --> 02:25.165
It's an experiment...

02:26.500 --> 02:28.790
Show us the right path...

02:29.500 --> 02:33.665
Make humans humane...

03:19.250 --> 03:27.915
Be truthful always...

03:47.500 --> 03:49.874
Doctor, you got a courier.

03:56.125 --> 03:57.165
Keep it there.

04:00.625 --> 04:01.957
Switch on the processor.

04:07.958 --> 04:09.665
Good, move like that only.

04:14.083 --> 04:15.540
Bloody black beetle!

04:29.458 --> 04:30.499
You needed this!

04:32.583 --> 04:40.082
He's kicking now like a fetus,
how will he kick once completed?

05:25.791 --> 05:26.540
pick it up!

05:32.208 --> 05:35.249
Aluminium box, get me
a strong filter coffee.

05:35.458 --> 05:37.749
No coffee to grade 2, take water.

05:37.958 --> 05:39.832
How about grade 3 then junk box?

05:42.333 --> 05:44.040
Humans have no respect in this lab.

06:13.375 --> 06:21.082
Robot...robot...

06:32.166 --> 06:33.124
Walk like me.

06:43.916 --> 06:46.540
I'll start data transfer,
cut it on getting connection.

07:14.833 --> 07:18.790
My intelligence is unlimited...
Your intelligence is vast...

07:19.000 --> 07:22.749
I know many languages...
created a new world...

07:23.333 --> 07:27.332
No respiration...

07:27.541 --> 07:31.124
Man is cunning...
Robot will not lose to him...

07:41.916 --> 07:43.165
Giving pose like Bruce Lee.

08:18.833 --> 08:20.874
Don't you check emails and
SMS's in your lab?

08:21.291 --> 08:22.165
Where is he?

08:22.958 --> 08:25.040
Why does he need
a girl friend and love?

08:25.333 --> 08:26.374
Is he alive inside?

08:26.583 --> 08:29.082
He's with wires inside.
He'll get angry if I disturb him.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.249
Let him get angry,
tell him Sana is here.

08:31.250 --> 08:32.415
Go quickly.

08:34.291 --> 08:36.790
- Do you've any sister, Sana?
- No.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.832
Mother?
I mean brother?

08:39.041 --> 08:40.624
No, I mean cousin sister.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.415
How many times I've told you
not to disturb me?

08:48.583 --> 08:50.249
He's hitting with a motor, Sana.

08:50.458 --> 08:51.915
It seems he'll not meet
even if Obama is here.

08:52.125 --> 08:53.040
Did you tell him Sana is here?

08:53.250 --> 08:54.832
I told him, he asked you to
call him on phone later.

08:55.041 --> 08:57.124
Tell him to make pickle of his phones.

09:07.208 --> 09:09.290
Tell him I'll never see him again.

09:21.875 --> 09:24.374
Boys, give him speech training,
I'll come back now.

09:25.708 --> 09:27.374
Hey buddy! Repeat!

09:28.125 --> 09:30.457
Why are you looking like that?

09:30.666 --> 09:35.832
Donkey, bull...
May I kick you with my dung legs?

09:36.041 --> 09:38.540
Answer me, you metal head!

09:39.166 --> 09:40.499
Have you given him any useful training?

09:41.250 --> 09:44.082
- That is...have you come back so quickly?
- Tell me.

09:44.791 --> 09:45.665
Hey buddy!

09:46.000 --> 09:46.790
Repeat!

09:47.916 --> 09:50.457
Why are you looking like that?

09:50.625 --> 09:56.749
Donkey, bull...
May I kick you with my dung legs?

09:58.416 --> 10:01.457
Answer me, you metal head!

10:04.375 --> 10:06.457
What's this? Is this the speech
training you gave him?

10:06.875 --> 10:08.415
It wasn't me, it was by Siva.

10:09.208 --> 10:11.624
I wanted to start with abuses
and then move on language...

10:13.291 --> 10:15.832
This is my ten year hard work.
Don't play with it.

10:16.458 --> 10:18.749
If you teach anything like this,
I'll punish you severely.

10:23.458 --> 10:25.915
Hey junk head!
Complaining about us to him.

10:26.041 --> 10:28.040
I'll dismantle and sell you as junk.

10:29.708 --> 10:31.665
Looks like it'll bite,
come let's go.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.040
Robot...robot...though I've learnt
many languages...

10:50.166 --> 10:53.082
My father tongue is Telugu...

10:54.333 --> 10:58.290
Robot..robot...though won
over the world...

10:58.291 --> 11:02.915
I'm a slave to my creator...

11:03.125 --> 11:10.832
Robot, come down to earth...

11:35.666 --> 11:38.207
Success doctor,
next is AIRD approval, right?

11:38.958 --> 11:42.040
No Siva, though everything
is programmed,

11:42.583 --> 11:44.124
he's an innocent machine.

11:44.125 --> 11:45.624
Like an infant.

11:45.833 --> 11:49.332
We must take him to the outside world
and let him move with other humans,

11:49.875 --> 11:52.874
after studying how to utilize his intelligence
for the betterment of humans,

11:53.083 --> 11:56.332
and after correcting those things,
we must take it to AIRD.

11:56.541 --> 11:57.874
You want to move close with humans.

11:58.625 --> 11:59.957
It'll be show!

12:05.791 --> 12:06.957
Coming!

12:07.583 --> 12:09.874
It's been months,
don't know what's he up to?

12:10.083 --> 12:12.374
He's spoiling his health in research.

12:13.208 --> 12:14.040
Hi mom!

12:14.541 --> 12:17.249
What's this Vasi?
You look like a saint on leave.

12:17.458 --> 12:19.540
Hi Dad! I've a shocking surprise for you.

12:19.750 --> 12:20.790
What's it son?

12:23.791 --> 12:26.207
What's this?
Have you got cloned?

12:27.166 --> 12:28.040
No dad.

12:28.041 --> 12:31.165
Don't confuse us, son.
Who are you sunny?

12:35.583 --> 12:36.957
He's smarter than you.

12:38.083 --> 12:41.290
Dad, I've developed this robot.
Many types of robots are there.

12:41.500 --> 12:44.957
This is Android Humanoid Robot.
A human like machine.

12:47.625 --> 12:48.332
This is mother.

12:48.583 --> 12:51.624
- Mother!
- Yes mother. Greet mother now.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.249
It's doing just like human.

12:57.333 --> 13:00.790
It'll do everything a human can do
and also do what humans can't.

13:01.333 --> 13:02.915
Then you don't need these
useless guys.

13:03.125 --> 13:05.207
- Father!
- No, I need them.

13:05.625 --> 13:07.832
If they're not here,
who will clean robot every day,

13:08.041 --> 13:09.624
who will make it wear
brief and socks.

13:09.833 --> 13:12.957
You're making a post graduate
into a baby sitter.

13:13.166 --> 13:15.332
Vasi, come to have breakfast.

13:16.250 --> 13:19.124
Robot, you too join them.
Eat hot idlies.

13:19.833 --> 13:22.749
What? I think she'll even serve him
mutton soup too.

13:23.625 --> 13:26.415
It's food is just two units of
electricity every day, mom.

13:26.416 --> 13:28.999
Why are you calling as it?
Didn't you name him?

13:29.250 --> 13:31.624
Mother, select a good name for him.

13:31.833 --> 13:34.749
If you'd a younger brother I thought
of naming him as Chittibabu.

13:34.750 --> 13:37.207
It's nice!
We can fondly call him as Chitti.

13:37.416 --> 13:39.499
Me? Chitti?

13:39.916 --> 13:42.832
Chitti, put the TV.

13:51.583 --> 13:53.665
Mother, he'll put if you
ask him to put.

13:53.875 --> 13:56.165
You must tell him clearly
to switch on the TV.

13:57.750 --> 14:00.665
Vasi! Why are you leaving so early?
Back to lab?

14:00.875 --> 14:02.457
No mother, I must cut hair and
meet Sana immediately,

14:02.666 --> 14:03.915
she's furious on me. Get in.

14:06.416 --> 14:07.874
- Who will drive the car?
- Chitti!

14:08.083 --> 14:08.915
Chitti? No way!

14:09.333 --> 14:11.082
No need to take such risk, doctor.

14:11.291 --> 14:11.790
Aren't you also coming?

14:12.041 --> 14:14.707
I think I've stomach upset.
You carry on.

14:14.916 --> 14:15.332
You?

14:15.541 --> 14:17.540
I didn't inform my home,
you carry on.

14:20.666 --> 14:23.457
- Watch out doctor, he may pull out
brake instead of applying it.- Yes.

14:23.666 --> 14:26.165
- Am I not here with him?
- He broke TV while you were here, right?

14:29.583 --> 14:30.540
Don't do anything without
getting my permission.

14:30.750 --> 14:31.915
Okay doctor.
Where should I go now?

14:45.625 --> 14:46.665
Idiot! Why did you apply the brake?

14:46.833 --> 14:49.707
You told me not to do anything
without your permission.

14:50.333 --> 14:51.332
- Hey useless!
- New word!

14:51.583 --> 14:52.832
Are you driving drunk?

14:53.041 --> 14:54.499
No, I'm driving the car with petrol.

14:54.916 --> 14:56.790
Don't answer him, drive the car.

15:03.458 --> 15:06.707
Don't make it too short,
just quarter inch is enough.

15:06.916 --> 15:09.165
I'll cut like nipping the nails, sir.

15:10.416 --> 15:13.165
Didn't come here for quite some time?
Out of station or no time?

15:13.375 --> 15:14.290
Work.

15:14.500 --> 15:16.374
- Is he your brother?
- Take it as like that only.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.665
- Sir, haircut for you?
- No need.

15:18.958 --> 15:21.165
- This is wig.
- Wig?

15:21.291 --> 15:23.624
- What's your age?
- One day!

15:25.500 --> 15:27.207
Sir is playing truant with me.

15:27.958 --> 15:29.457
Read books.

15:34.916 --> 15:36.332
Is he counting the pages?

15:46.916 --> 15:48.290
Do you've any other books?

15:49.916 --> 15:51.332
Have you finished reading
all the books?

15:51.333 --> 15:52.415
Finished.

15:52.416 --> 15:54.499
You've just telephone directory to read.

16:06.125 --> 16:06.957
Finished that too?

16:08.125 --> 16:09.790
- Do you know all the numbers?
- I know.

16:10.083 --> 16:11.124
Chiranjeevi's number?

16:14.250 --> 16:17.415
Everyone knows it, tell my number.

16:17.416 --> 16:19.290
- Your name?
- Bhajan Lal.

16:24.708 --> 16:26.457
There are 1 2 Bhajan Lals,
tell me your initials.

16:26.666 --> 16:27.665
K Bhajan Lal.

16:28.916 --> 16:30.832
There are 3 K Bhajan Lals.
Tell me your address.

16:31.041 --> 16:33.957

16:39.333 --> 16:44.040
My number is 44433321 ,
tell me my name.

16:45.083 --> 16:46.540
Hello Mr.P Peethambaram.

17:01.750 --> 17:02.374
What?

17:06.125 --> 17:07.790
I was very busy in my lab
all these days.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.082
Stay put in your lab,
who asked you to come here?

17:10.916 --> 17:12.790
I can understand you're angry.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.707
How many phone calls?
How many SMS's? How many Emails?

17:15.916 --> 17:17.582
How many times I would've
come to you?

17:18.541 --> 17:21.749
Did you speak a word with me?
I got vexed.

17:21.958 --> 17:22.790
Look Sana,

17:24.166 --> 17:27.165
one, I don't know what's happening
around me while I'm in work,

17:27.375 --> 17:30.290
two, if you know what was
I working on all these days...

17:30.708 --> 17:33.832
I've class, whatever it is come
to Gandhi park in the evening.

17:34.791 --> 17:35.707
Let's meet in the evening.

17:38.083 --> 17:40.665
Not to romance,
to break up our love.

17:40.875 --> 17:42.749
Break the love?
What do you mean by it?

17:42.958 --> 17:46.082
After our marriage, you'll spend time with
machines and I'll be left with loneliness,

17:46.291 --> 17:49.249
instead of going for divorce then,
let's break up now, that's better.

17:49.250 --> 17:52.332
Let's part ways, you take your way,
your exclusive way.

18:10.083 --> 18:13.082
Agreement for breaking up as lovers,
the letters you wrote to me,

18:13.083 --> 18:14.249
the greetings you sent me,

18:14.916 --> 18:17.665
the book you gave me,
A Briefer History of Time.

18:18.375 --> 18:19.499
Freakonomics!

18:20.041 --> 18:22.957
See! Lord Kumaraswamy's photo
for Valentines Day.

18:23.458 --> 18:25.665
Have you ever bought something
really touching?

18:29.583 --> 18:30.290
This one?

18:30.666 --> 18:32.749
Would anyone gift a shaving set
to his girl friend?

18:32.958 --> 18:35.124
- I thought could be useful...
- My foot!

18:41.750 --> 18:45.082
I've returned everything
you gave me. Sign this.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.165
We don't have anything
between us hereafter.

18:47.916 --> 18:49.624
- That's all?
- That's all!

18:49.625 --> 18:51.707
- Have you returned all I gave you?
- Yes.

18:51.916 --> 18:55.165
Then what about the
2 power 9, 51 2 kisses?

18:56.166 --> 18:59.624
Do you keep counting the kisses too?
Won't you feel while kissing?

19:00.041 --> 19:02.749
Silly matrix head!
I can't return it.

19:03.166 --> 19:04.290
Break up is valid only
when you return it.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.207
This is wrong rule, I'll not accept.

19:06.208 --> 19:08.290
Then I'll not sign the agreement,
I refuse.

19:09.416 --> 19:10.374
He's a pain!

19:13.166 --> 19:14.124
Close your eyes.

19:21.625 --> 19:23.999
What's this?
This is post office kiss.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.665
- Did I kiss you like this?
- Then what?

19:25.875 --> 19:28.999
Holding your waist,
hugging you tightly...

19:32.958 --> 19:33.582
No way!

19:33.791 --> 19:35.249
Then break up is cancelled.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.332
I'll come and trouble you every day.

19:37.666 --> 19:38.790
You're a torture!

19:40.875 --> 19:42.540
Let me get rid of him today forever.

19:43.916 --> 19:44.832
Come closer.

19:45.875 --> 19:46.749
Close your eyes.

19:48.791 --> 19:49.915
Don't smile.

19:56.083 --> 19:58.582
- Is it okay?
- Too much of gap.

20:00.583 --> 20:01.582
Still closer.

20:50.458 --> 20:54.999
How many love cells
are in the body?

20:55.208 --> 21:01.457
How many neutrons and
electrons are in your eyes?

21:02.291 --> 21:08.415
Just thinking about you makes
my nerves desire...

21:11.750 --> 21:16.707
Sana...Sana...a question...
Are you the epitome of beauty?

21:18.333 --> 21:22.665
Are you Newton's law of gravity?
Is your friendship it's effect?

21:22.875 --> 21:27.124
Are you the smile of thousands of stars?

21:32.333 --> 21:36.665
You're a simpleton...
But smart in asking kisses...

21:43.375 --> 21:44.374
It's love for you in my heart...

21:44.583 --> 21:49.499
There's war in the lips...
Rose petals are bleeding...

21:59.000 --> 22:01.290
I'll come with you...

22:03.666 --> 22:06.082
Rose flower in the clouds...

22:34.250 --> 22:43.457
Butterflies...have the
sense of taste in legs...

22:43.666 --> 22:51.832
Love bug bitten humans...
Taste the love with eyes...

22:52.041 --> 22:55.874
Running water has more oxygen...

22:56.916 --> 23:02.165
Hearts that sing desire more...

23:02.166 --> 23:04.290
My desire come...

23:04.500 --> 23:10.499
Let's make life times love in
few moments, come my dear...

23:10.708 --> 23:22.332
My love! Spare time for our love,
my heart is in pain...

23:22.500 --> 23:34.749
My love! Like your thin waist,
love has grown thin like it in my work...

25:51.333 --> 25:54.124
My love...

25:59.958 --> 26:01.707
- Berry.
- Berry?

26:01.916 --> 26:04.540
- Who is the driver?
- Which driver?

26:04.750 --> 26:06.207
There are many drivers.

26:08.083 --> 26:09.707
Who is the driver of this car?

26:10.416 --> 26:11.082
Me!

26:11.416 --> 26:13.249
Why did you park the car
in no parking zone?

26:13.458 --> 26:16.832
The board says no parking only,
it doesn't say Dr.Vasikar car no parking.

26:17.041 --> 26:19.790
- Are you playing with me?
- No, I'm replying you.

26:21.416 --> 26:23.624
- Take out you driving license.
- I don't have driving license.

26:23.833 --> 26:25.499
How can you drive without a license?

26:25.500 --> 26:27.374
With driving module program.

26:27.625 --> 26:28.915
Don't cook up stories,
come to the station.

26:29.125 --> 26:29.957
Which station?

26:32.500 --> 26:34.874
Making fun of me?
What is your name?

26:35.583 --> 26:36.249
Tell me your address.

26:36.458 --> 26:39.582
I've Ip address only. 1 08.1 1 .0.1

26:39.791 --> 26:42.165
Why are you giving rash replies to me?

26:42.166 --> 26:43.499
- What is your father's name?
- No father.

26:43.708 --> 26:45.082
- Mother?
- No mother.

26:45.291 --> 26:47.040
- Orphan?
- Not orphan too.

26:47.208 --> 26:48.374
How were you born then?

26:48.375 --> 26:51.624
- I wasn't born, I was made.
- Made?

26:52.375 --> 26:56.124
- Are you mad?
- No, everything is tight.

26:56.291 --> 26:57.832
- Taunting me?
- No nickel.

26:58.041 --> 26:59.582
Bolts are made of nickel.

26:59.958 --> 27:02.665
- Stop it!
- What should I stop? Tell me.

27:07.750 --> 27:09.249
Look...no need of argument.

27:09.250 --> 27:14.374
parking offense, no driving license.
You're talking too much.

27:14.875 --> 27:17.582
If you go to court they'll put
a fine of Rs.1 000,

27:18.916 --> 27:20.582
will you go to the court
or settle it here only?

27:20.791 --> 27:23.082
- I'll settle it here only.
- That's better.

27:23.833 --> 27:24.249
Settle it.

27:27.625 --> 27:28.499
I have.

27:29.958 --> 27:31.165
Trying to irritate me?

27:31.250 --> 27:32.749
Don't you know the meaning of settling?

27:34.416 --> 27:35.040
Cut!

27:35.250 --> 27:39.499
- Where should I cut?
- In my hand.

27:40.916 --> 27:43.415
Do it fast.
Cut it fast!

27:45.791 --> 27:48.832
He has cut my hand!

27:49.250 --> 27:50.374
What happened Chitti?

27:50.583 --> 27:52.040
He asked me to cut, I did it.

27:54.083 --> 27:55.165
Who is it?
He's just like you.

27:55.166 --> 27:57.082
Get into the car, I'll tell you.
Come on take out the car.

27:57.291 --> 27:59.832
Don't go...stop...stop...police...

28:00.041 --> 28:02.665
- Is he your brother? Twins?
- No.

28:02.875 --> 28:06.165
- We'll be in trouble, drive fast.
- Is he your friend then?

28:06.375 --> 28:07.124
No.

28:07.583 --> 28:09.874
Driver? He doesn't look like that.

28:10.083 --> 28:11.124
Wait, I'll tell you everything later.

28:11.333 --> 28:13.374
Check if he's following us
or not and drive.

28:19.625 --> 28:20.540
Turn!

28:21.208 --> 28:22.457
Why are you turning head for everything?

28:22.666 --> 28:24.540
You told me to see behind and drive.

28:24.750 --> 28:27.374
- Can't you see it in the mirror?
- Can't you tell me that earlier?

28:28.625 --> 28:29.415
Drive!

29:17.958 --> 29:20.665
Gentlemen, he's equal
to 1 00 humans.

29:21.125 --> 29:24.624
He has been programmed with intelligence
and talent of 1 00 humans.

29:25.125 --> 29:26.915
He knows all the arts.

29:27.125 --> 29:28.915
He knows all the languages
of this world.

29:38.791 --> 29:42.124
His eyes are not just to see,
but to show also.

29:48.625 --> 29:50.040
You can to talk to him virtually.

29:50.250 --> 29:54.874
Such robots will help in progress
and defence of our nation,

29:54.875 --> 29:57.165
you can ask if you've
any doubts with Chitti.

29:57.375 --> 30:02.915
Asking you a simple question,
241 5781 7 Fibonocci number?

30:03.125 --> 30:05.665
Yes 22 Fibonocci number!

30:05.875 --> 30:09.499
By the way, that's Madhapur
Madhava Rao's phone number.

30:11.625 --> 30:14.624
The biggest prime number you know.

30:19.125 --> 30:23.165
M44, you may take few years
to know if it's right.

30:36.125 --> 30:36.957
What Raaga is this?

30:37.166 --> 30:39.624
You started with Nattukurnji and
trespassed into Husseini.

30:39.833 --> 30:40.624
In the middle...

30:45.750 --> 30:47.124
You lost the rhythm here.

30:53.250 --> 30:54.457
Is God there or not?

30:54.666 --> 30:56.957
- Who is God?
- One who created all of us.

30:57.166 --> 30:59.124
Dr.Vasikar created me.

30:59.333 --> 31:00.415
God is there!

31:25.625 --> 31:27.624
What a great creation!

31:30.958 --> 31:32.290
- Do you know to paint, Chitti?
- I know.

31:32.500 --> 31:33.624
Can you paint my picture?

31:51.916 --> 31:53.207
Can we take a photo?

31:58.291 --> 32:00.124
Look, how they're falling on him.

32:03.125 --> 32:04.999
Hi girls!

32:05.916 --> 32:08.165
I fixed Chitti's all motors.

32:08.708 --> 32:09.582
I'm deputy scientist Ravi.

32:09.791 --> 32:11.915
- Deputy scientist means?
- Helper!

32:12.208 --> 32:14.790
- I change Chitti's dress.
- Including brief.

32:17.208 --> 32:18.999
Why are you all after him?

32:19.208 --> 32:20.999
Though he has talent of
hundred people,

32:21.208 --> 32:24.457
he doesn't have one important
thing which we have.

32:27.625 --> 32:30.207
It seems I don't have a thing
which they have, what is it?

32:30.416 --> 32:32.332
- Why didn't you give that to me?
- He has complained on us.

32:33.500 --> 32:35.374
Fools! Don't you've common sense
of what to talk to him?

32:35.583 --> 32:38.165
No, we've feelings and he doesn't,
that's what we were to tell...

32:38.375 --> 32:39.665
Don't try to change it,
cheap fellows.

32:39.666 --> 32:41.040
One month salary cut.

32:50.875 --> 32:53.832
You've told me, Chairman of AIRD.
Your Guru!

32:54.041 --> 32:55.582
His photo is in our lab.

33:05.208 --> 33:06.332
Your motors?

33:14.166 --> 33:15.582
Can you please tell me about
your neural schema?

33:15.791 --> 33:17.290
- I can't.
- Why?

33:18.583 --> 33:20.999
I'm Vasikar's professor.

33:21.208 --> 33:22.957
You can tell me, it's not wrong.

33:23.166 --> 33:24.415
I'll check and tell.

33:25.125 --> 33:27.415
Doctor, he's asking about
my neural schema.

33:27.625 --> 33:28.499
Can I tell him?

33:31.083 --> 33:32.457
You're asking know-how,

33:32.875 --> 33:35.999
I'm hesitant to release it
till I get the patent.

33:36.875 --> 33:39.540
Because he can be
misused very easily.

33:41.333 --> 33:45.957
Just wanted to know how much
Chitti knows about himself.

33:48.166 --> 33:50.665
After studying him complete,
I'll bring him to you only.

33:50.666 --> 33:52.124
For AIRD evaluation.

34:03.750 --> 34:06.374
Vasi, I like Chitti very much.

34:06.583 --> 34:09.124
Can I take him to my home
for two days?

34:09.791 --> 34:12.082
Is he pomeranian or Teddy bear
to keep for two days?

34:12.291 --> 34:17.540
No, I've my final exams, didn't study
well getting upset with you,

34:17.750 --> 34:22.165
I feel Chitti would be
very helpful, please.

34:22.375 --> 34:23.124
Okay, take him.

34:23.333 --> 34:24.540
You both go with her.

34:25.458 --> 34:27.124
Gents are not allowed in home.

34:27.291 --> 34:28.582
Who said we are men?

34:29.041 --> 34:30.457
Call me if you've any trouble.

34:56.208 --> 34:58.290
Walk straight!

35:12.375 --> 35:14.374
Not bun, I said gun.

35:27.416 --> 35:30.457
I've programmed you with
8 lakh line of codes.

35:30.666 --> 35:32.874
I'm ordering to pick up gun
and you're picking up bun.

35:33.208 --> 35:35.582
Will you pluck lives
if I say pluck hair?

35:42.375 --> 35:45.624
Vasikar is my student.
He was sensational!

35:46.125 --> 35:50.415
The robot he created won a
standing ovation in the conference.

35:50.916 --> 35:53.540
This is sleeping on ground
and teasing me.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.832
I'll pluck life...

35:56.833 --> 35:58.082
Leave my neck...leave...

35:58.291 --> 36:05.999
Task incomplete...
pluck life...pluck life...

36:29.875 --> 36:31.374
I'll congratulate you.

36:34.333 --> 36:36.165
Happy Home,
what do you mean by it?

36:36.333 --> 36:38.124
My father was in Army.

36:38.333 --> 36:40.957
He died in Kargil war at the age of 40.

36:41.291 --> 36:42.749
Sorrow, tears...

36:45.458 --> 36:47.499
How long can we live like that?

36:47.708 --> 36:51.249
There are so many women left as orphans
after losing husband and son.

36:51.458 --> 36:55.207
We started this home to give them
a family of their own.

36:55.208 --> 36:56.999
Nobody can change
what has happened,

36:57.208 --> 36:59.165
nobody can stop
what is going to happen,

36:59.500 --> 37:02.457
every one must be happy
this moment, that's it,

37:02.458 --> 37:03.457
Happy Home!

37:04.375 --> 37:07.207
Is the child kicking
the football well, Lata sister?

37:07.416 --> 37:10.207
Let it come out,
I'll ask it to kick you.

37:11.458 --> 37:16.082
Who is it?

37:16.291 --> 37:18.582
Men inside the home, boy friend?

37:18.958 --> 37:21.207
Not boy friend but toy friend, mother.

37:21.333 --> 37:25.082
- It's name is Chitti, it's a robot.
- Robot?

37:25.333 --> 37:27.457
- Why are you lying to me?
- She's right.

37:34.041 --> 37:35.749
Don't scare people like this, fix it.

37:38.750 --> 37:41.249
Mother, you'll be surprized with
the work it can do.

37:41.458 --> 37:42.832
Can it cook?

37:43.333 --> 37:46.457
prepare something to eat,
I'll take bath.

38:21.458 --> 38:24.332
Just one day and
I've lot to study.

38:24.500 --> 38:29.499
I'll tell line by line what I've read,
if I'm wrong, correct me.

38:40.541 --> 38:41.749
Have you finished reading all books?

38:43.708 --> 38:45.499
I'll test you.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.249
What are monozygotic
and dizygotic twins?

38:56.083 --> 38:59.249
If you can by heart lessons so fast
you can become a doctor in a day.

39:26.041 --> 39:28.040
Their trouble is increasing
with every day.

39:31.375 --> 39:33.582
Why are you playing so loudly?
Reduce the volume.

39:36.375 --> 39:41.332
We spent a million bucks to set up deck,
amp, woofers, surround speakers.

39:41.625 --> 39:46.332
Do you want us to hear it in
headphones instead of full volume?

39:46.541 --> 39:48.082
It's exam time,
so many people are studying.

39:48.083 --> 39:49.499
There are heart patients too.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.457
It seems heart is aching!

39:53.666 --> 39:56.999
Use cotton stubs!
In ears!

40:06.666 --> 40:08.540
Chitti, do something.

40:08.750 --> 40:11.915
Don't worry, remote control is infra red.
I'll take care of it.

40:38.125 --> 40:39.082
Close your ears!

41:34.375 --> 41:35.832
Who is that Ammoru Talli?

41:43.375 --> 41:46.249
Hi, sound is too high,
will you reduce the volume?

41:46.458 --> 41:49.790
We are celebrating festival by offering
appeasements to Ammoru Talli,

41:50.000 --> 41:51.165
and how dare you're asking us
to reduce the volume.

41:51.375 --> 41:53.207
We are unable to study
for the exams.

41:54.041 --> 41:56.457
pray to Goddess and
put little sacred ash in mouth,

41:56.666 --> 41:57.749
you'll pass the exams.

41:57.916 --> 41:59.124
Reduce the volume...

42:04.500 --> 42:06.749
Sana, no more troublesome
loud speakers. Come, let's go.

42:07.500 --> 42:09.374
Hey brother, he broke the mike set.

42:09.583 --> 42:10.957
Hey stop!

42:12.583 --> 42:13.957
Bloody stop there!

42:33.875 --> 42:43.290
Goddess mother!

42:50.041 --> 42:51.249
What's this?

42:51.458 --> 42:52.999
He's a magician.

42:53.208 --> 42:54.915
He took away all our weapons.

43:27.083 --> 43:28.374
Why are you crying Sana?

43:29.083 --> 43:31.624
I'm sure to fail, Chitti.
I haven't read anything.

43:31.833 --> 43:34.665
Time is over.
I feel giddy on seeing this book.

43:34.833 --> 43:37.749
- Shall I write your exam?
- Don't talk nonsense, Chitti.

43:37.958 --> 43:39.874
There's photo ID and exam card.

43:40.541 --> 43:43.165
- You can't write the exam.
- We can do the Zig p.

43:43.916 --> 43:44.832
What do you mean by it?

44:08.208 --> 44:09.332
What are you doing here?

44:10.458 --> 44:13.790
Sana is writing exam there.
I'm telling her the answer.

44:14.625 --> 44:15.832
How can you tell her from here?

44:15.833 --> 44:17.957
I've a built in data transmitter.

44:18.166 --> 44:20.249
There's a trans receiver in Sana's ear,

44:22.833 --> 44:25.374
- Is it hi-tech bit?
- Not bit byte.

44:25.583 --> 44:27.499
Till now I've transferred 2 mb data.

44:27.500 --> 44:29.999
Did you see how people have developed?

44:31.250 --> 44:32.207
please wait.

44:32.416 --> 44:34.415
- I'll come after the umbilical cord is cut.
- What?

44:34.625 --> 44:36.540
Will you come now or
shall I call the security?

44:48.166 --> 44:51.415
It seems you've a receiver in ear
and copying as he dictates.

44:51.541 --> 44:52.749
- Who told you?
- Me.

44:53.208 --> 44:54.540
I don't know who is he.

44:54.541 --> 44:56.165
Why are you lying Sana?

45:00.541 --> 45:02.624
He's blabbering.
I think he's gone mad, sir.

45:02.833 --> 45:05.332
I don't have brain, just CpU only.
perfect condition.

45:05.541 --> 45:08.749
No doubt, he's mental.
Take him away, running out of my time.

45:08.958 --> 45:10.790
I thought when he was talking
to himself alone,

45:11.000 --> 45:12.249
may be some old medical student.

45:12.250 --> 45:15.249
Sir, you please go out.
Go and cut the umbilical cord.

45:15.500 --> 45:17.540
What would you do for menstruation
and fertilization, Sana?

45:17.541 --> 45:20.040
That's her problem, you go out.

46:02.333 --> 46:04.707
If you hadn't helped me,
I would've definitely failed.

46:04.916 --> 46:06.832
Why are you wetting my cheek for it?

46:13.083 --> 46:15.290
If I get caught they'll rusticate
me for three years.

46:15.833 --> 46:18.040
That's why I had to disown you.

46:18.875 --> 46:21.165
- please don't feel for it.
- I don't have any feelings.

46:21.375 --> 46:24.499
I've understood that humans tell
lies to save themselves.

46:26.291 --> 46:26.999
True!

46:32.541 --> 46:35.332
Move...move...get down...
board next compartment.

46:35.541 --> 46:37.832
Brother, that's him.

46:41.875 --> 46:43.540
Are you such a macho man?

46:43.916 --> 46:44.790
Come now!

46:46.625 --> 46:49.165
What are you looking at?
You can't attract anything

46:49.166 --> 46:50.999
we are having stones and sticks.

46:51.208 --> 46:51.624
Come on!

46:51.833 --> 46:54.582
- Why are they calling me?
- Keep quiet.

46:55.416 --> 46:58.540
You brought him for protection,
tell him to come now.

47:02.916 --> 47:06.665
Chitti, my purse.
My hall ticket and ID is in it.

47:34.166 --> 47:36.249
You ruined my home theatre, right?

47:36.750 --> 47:39.582
Shall I ruin your home theatre now?

48:27.625 --> 48:28.957
Bash up them!

52:26.750 --> 52:29.582
You'll be shocked to know
what Chitti did today.

52:37.416 --> 52:41.582
Had he been a human,
I would've ditched you and loved him.

52:43.625 --> 52:46.915
- I see your face frowning.
- No.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.707
Whatever he does,
the entire credit goes to you only.

52:57.333 --> 52:59.249
My love is always yours only.

53:11.791 --> 53:13.957
Chitti, you too join us.
Take photo of all three together.

53:16.791 --> 53:20.415
Boom...boom...robot...

53:20.625 --> 53:24.874
Zoom...zoom...robot...

53:48.125 --> 53:51.749
Is robot Isaac Asimov's fear?

53:51.958 --> 53:55.582
Is robot Isaac Newton's magic?

53:55.791 --> 53:59.790
Is robot Einstein's brainchild?

54:31.458 --> 54:35.207
Robot you've unleashed Chitti...

54:35.416 --> 54:39.207
Wonder of science in
this modern world...

54:39.416 --> 54:41.124
You've mouth but no stomach...

54:41.333 --> 54:42.874
You can talk but never breath...

54:43.083 --> 54:44.624
You've pulse but no heart...

54:44.833 --> 54:47.124
You've power but no arrogance...

54:52.791 --> 54:56.457
O firestone, may you live eternally...

54:56.666 --> 55:00.415
You were born out of a man's love...

55:00.625 --> 55:04.415
You bloomed in the desire...

55:04.416 --> 55:08.249
You united us in love...

55:08.625 --> 55:15.832
Before we know our marriage day,
you're our son...

55:16.250 --> 55:17.874
Chitti...Chitti robot...

55:18.083 --> 55:20.165
My buddy robot...

55:20.166 --> 55:24.249
You're a darling of everyone
in every nook and corner...

55:56.625 --> 55:59.749
Hold him.

56:03.208 --> 56:04.540
O my dear sweet child!

56:09.750 --> 56:10.665
Don't you've sense?

56:11.166 --> 56:12.999
Leave me...leave me...

56:13.208 --> 56:20.249
Isn't there any lover like her who never
shuts mouth for little tiffs too?

56:20.458 --> 56:28.415
He was born to do
what ever I want...

56:28.791 --> 56:36.207
Gives boons without doing penance,
is he God?

56:36.625 --> 56:40.457
Auto man...automatic man...

56:40.458 --> 56:44.624
See the crowd swarming
for your autograph...

57:38.208 --> 57:42.832
You watching avidly as if
Shakila is dancing here.

57:43.291 --> 57:45.040
planning to complain about this too?
That's the idea.

57:45.041 --> 57:48.124
Tomorrow is AIRD's evaluation,
I'm doing peripheral trouble shooting.

57:49.250 --> 57:51.790
- Are you so great?
- Grammar mistake.

57:52.250 --> 57:53.624
He's great grammarian.

57:53.833 --> 57:57.457
Use he or she for humans.
Only animals and things are called as it,

57:57.625 --> 58:01.207
so says grammarian's thesis.

58:01.416 --> 58:01.832
Shut up.

58:02.041 --> 58:06.165
Forget about what he said
in a book or a TV interview,

58:06.375 --> 58:08.915
are you greater than us
if you're better informed?

58:09.125 --> 58:11.040
- Yes.
- What yes?

58:11.041 --> 58:12.207
Can you drink like us?

58:12.208 --> 58:14.124
Can you smoke like us?

58:14.125 --> 58:15.332
Can you eat biryani like us?

58:15.333 --> 58:17.207
Can you puke like us after eating?

58:17.250 --> 58:18.665
Can you atleast spit?

58:18.875 --> 58:20.832
- Can you write your initials
while pissing on wall?- Correct!

58:21.041 --> 58:23.124
Is that all difference the
between me and man?

58:25.750 --> 58:27.707
- Looks like a punch in dark!
- Indeed!

58:27.916 --> 58:30.040
These items are in
my don't eat rule list.

58:30.708 --> 58:32.915
The same rule list says to obey
our orders, right?

58:32.916 --> 58:34.499
- Yes.
- Then, drink this.

58:34.708 --> 58:35.874
Eat this biryani.

58:36.083 --> 58:38.374
- I'll ask doctor.
- Doctor?

58:40.666 --> 58:43.207
They are asking me to drink alcohol
beverages and eat biryani,

58:43.458 --> 58:45.332
rule priority clash,
what should I do now?

58:45.541 --> 58:46.999
Beat those rascals with slippers.

58:48.541 --> 58:49.207
You...

58:51.541 --> 58:52.707
Give me your slippers.

58:53.166 --> 58:55.040
Slippers? Take it.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.624
Are you going to eat it?

58:58.083 --> 58:59.082
He may eat!

59:07.416 --> 59:09.999
Leave us,
all are watching us on road.

59:10.583 --> 59:11.582
Chitti, stop it...

59:11.791 --> 59:14.624
- Task incomplete.
- What? Incomplete?

59:16.791 --> 59:19.915
Doctor...doctor...stop Chitti...

59:20.083 --> 59:21.957
- You need it.
- No.

59:21.958 --> 59:23.874
- Do you've any sense?
- No.

59:24.083 --> 59:25.665
I asked you to get it ready
for AIRD's evaluation,

59:25.875 --> 59:27.374
you're asking him to drink
and eat biryani.

59:27.583 --> 59:30.165
- We never told it, doctor.
- He's lying, doctor.

59:30.375 --> 59:32.415
Only humans lie, machines don't.

59:48.458 --> 59:50.207
Human life is priceless.

59:50.333 --> 59:53.749
Thousands of army men die is wars,

59:54.041 --> 59:56.415
many families face difficulties
losing them,

59:56.625 --> 1:00:00.082
if we use robots instead of men,
there won't be any human loss,

1:00:00.541 --> 1:00:03.582
producing Android Humanoids
like him in great numbers,

1:00:03.791 --> 1:00:05.832
my aim is to present them
to Indian army.

1:00:06.041 --> 1:00:07.457
AIRD's approval for it
is necessary.

1:00:07.666 --> 1:00:11.415
humbly request authorities and
scientists must evaluate Chitti,

1:00:11.625 --> 1:00:14.249
and approve it.

1:00:15.166 --> 1:00:20.165
Is this robot created with Asimov's
principle of not hurting humans?

1:00:20.375 --> 1:00:22.082
This robot wasn't created like that.

1:00:22.291 --> 1:00:26.874
Because robots would face situations
in war where it has to kill humans.

1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:36.124
Reverse is possible.

1:00:39.125 --> 1:00:42.457
Greek runner Achilles while
competing with a tortoise,

1:00:42.666 --> 1:00:45.082
if tortoise comes little earlier,

1:00:45.291 --> 1:00:47.624
it's proven theory that
tortoise has won,

1:00:47.625 --> 1:00:49.207
- do you know about it?
- I know.

1:00:49.416 --> 1:00:50.624
It's a paradox.

1:00:50.833 --> 1:00:53.415
In the process because it's
convergence is serious,

1:00:53.625 --> 1:00:54.957
Achilles also can win.

1:00:56.125 --> 1:00:58.999
What are you saying?
Can we approve it?

1:01:02.208 --> 1:01:04.540
Do you know the value of human life?

1:01:04.750 --> 1:01:06.457
It depends on whose life it is.

1:01:06.666 --> 1:01:09.457
Who will you save on
impending danger?

1:01:09.666 --> 1:01:12.374
Dr.Einstein or a small kid?

1:01:24.458 --> 1:01:25.165
Turn.

1:01:25.541 --> 1:01:26.332
Walk.

1:01:49.958 --> 1:01:51.124
Stab Vasikar.

1:02:03.875 --> 1:02:06.999
This is dangerous machine.
It'll kill anyone.

1:02:07.208 --> 1:02:08.832
I can't approve it.

1:02:09.291 --> 1:02:12.790
No professor, you gave him a wrong
command and confused it.

1:02:14.041 --> 1:02:16.915
It doesn't know good or bad
or friend or foe.

1:02:21.041 --> 1:02:26.207
If we induct in army, it'll kill our
Generals instead of enemies,

1:02:26.416 --> 1:02:27.832
letting it out in society is
also dangerous,

1:02:28.041 --> 1:02:29.749
it has cut a traffic constable's hand,

1:02:30.875 --> 1:02:35.374
we've complaint about breaking
bones of passengers in a train,

1:02:36.041 --> 1:02:40.915
this robot will suit to do only routine
programmed job in some factory,

1:02:49.625 --> 1:02:52.124
Why are you angry on me, Prof.?
Why are you doing this to me?

1:02:54.875 --> 1:02:56.540
I don't have any grouse on you.

1:02:57.250 --> 1:02:59.207
Science mustn't go wrong, that's all.

1:03:14.666 --> 1:03:17.999
What's this Chitti?
Why did you behave like this?

1:03:18.208 --> 1:03:21.540
What have I done wrong?
You told me to follow his orders, I did.

1:03:21.750 --> 1:03:23.124
If he asks to stab, will you stab me?

1:03:23.250 --> 1:03:24.915
It means that, right?

1:03:28.083 --> 1:03:31.415
Save us...save us...

1:03:37.416 --> 1:03:39.540
Sir, we are unable to near
as fire is intense.

1:03:39.750 --> 1:03:41.082
Many people are trapped inside.

1:03:41.291 --> 1:03:43.165
Send additional force sir.

1:03:43.500 --> 1:03:45.165
Can you save them, Chitti?

1:03:46.916 --> 1:03:51.124
I can with stand upto 1 000 degree,
I can save them.

1:03:51.625 --> 1:03:54.207
Not a life must go, Chitti.

1:04:07.541 --> 1:04:09.624
Save me...

1:04:14.250 --> 1:04:15.999
Somebody please save me.

1:04:19.333 --> 1:04:22.749
Don't get scared, I'm Chitti, a robot,
I'm here to save you.

1:04:36.458 --> 1:04:39.374
I would've died, he came like God
and saved me.

1:04:42.291 --> 1:04:48.457
Somebody please save me

1:05:11.250 --> 1:05:13.457
professor, watch TV.

1:05:13.541 --> 1:05:16.457
The robot you rejected as
dangerous to humans,

1:05:16.666 --> 1:05:19.374
is now saving humans
from a fire accident. Watch it!

1:05:19.583 --> 1:05:21.457
Save me...save my child...

1:05:21.666 --> 1:05:32.665
- Save me!
- Save me...

1:05:37.958 --> 1:05:39.207
Get down.

1:05:44.166 --> 1:05:48.332
Is everyone safe? Check!
Who is it?

1:05:48.916 --> 1:05:52.457
My daughter Gowri was taking bath,
she's missing.

1:05:52.708 --> 1:05:56.040
I don't know what happened to her.
Save her!

1:06:28.875 --> 1:06:31.249
Don't come near me, I'm naked.

1:06:31.625 --> 1:06:32.707
So what? I'm also naked.

1:06:32.916 --> 1:06:33.749
Don't come.

1:06:33.958 --> 1:06:43.749
Leave me...leave me...

1:06:46.208 --> 1:06:49.374
I'm naked, leave me...

1:06:52.750 --> 1:06:53.999
Here's your Gowri.

1:06:55.375 --> 1:06:57.874
- You've spoiled everything.
- Don't take pictures of me.

1:06:58.083 --> 1:06:59.957
The girl was naked.

1:07:00.166 --> 1:07:01.957
- She's alive.
- Go...

1:07:04.375 --> 1:07:07.915
- Don't take photos.
- I've been humiliated...

1:07:08.541 --> 1:07:13.874
Stop...listen to me...

1:07:26.500 --> 1:07:27.665
My daughter!..

1:07:29.750 --> 1:07:33.290
What's this Vasi?
You've killed an innocent girl unjustly.

1:07:35.166 --> 1:07:41.124
I told you it's a stupid machine.
It's dangerous to let it outside.

1:07:41.666 --> 1:07:45.832
You've proven now that
I was right in rejecting it.

1:07:53.375 --> 1:07:56.915
Stupid! Don't you know to cover the
girl with cloth and bring her?

1:07:57.250 --> 1:08:01.040
How can it know, Vasikar?
It's not a human but Humanoid.

1:08:01.333 --> 1:08:04.540
How can you explain honour
to a machine?

1:08:07.166 --> 1:08:13.290
The video of the girls suicide is shown
on TV news channels and tearing us.

1:08:13.833 --> 1:08:17.665
There's pressure from Defence Ministry.
To stop your research.

1:08:18.708 --> 1:08:21.207
No professor, I can't stop.

1:08:21.416 --> 1:08:23.707
I can make some changes in his
schema and correct him.

1:08:23.916 --> 1:08:25.165
How can you do it?

1:08:25.291 --> 1:08:28.582
It doesn't know man and woman,
it doesn't know honour and shame,

1:08:29.250 --> 1:08:31.624
it's insensitive to human feelings.

1:08:32.666 --> 1:08:34.749
I can give human feelings to it.

1:08:36.333 --> 1:08:38.082
Only God can do it.

1:08:38.291 --> 1:08:40.790
Man has made possible
many impossible things.

1:08:43.083 --> 1:08:44.582
That's why I'm telling you.

1:08:47.250 --> 1:08:50.457
1 0 years Professor,
my 1 0 year hard work.

1:08:51.375 --> 1:08:52.457
Isn't there any fruit to it?

1:08:52.666 --> 1:08:55.457
There is but in a different place.

1:08:57.500 --> 1:09:01.665
I've contacts with many robotic
companies in foreign countries,

1:09:02.166 --> 1:09:06.707
if you give this to them,
I can get you few million dollars.

1:09:07.041 --> 1:09:09.915
I didn't do it for money.

1:09:10.166 --> 1:09:11.999
My aim is to give it to Indian army.

1:09:13.041 --> 1:09:14.290
It's impossible.

1:09:14.916 --> 1:09:19.290
It must come to me for evaluation.

1:09:20.791 --> 1:09:23.124
Give me one last chance.

1:09:28.291 --> 1:09:34.457
If you still fail, dismantle it.
Sell it as junk to buy dates.

1:09:35.458 --> 1:09:39.332
Good for heart.
You need it.

1:09:49.291 --> 1:09:51.999
We both are sticking with
for 5 years in this lab.

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:55.832
- We got beaten with slippers.
- Find us any job in your lab.

1:09:56.041 --> 1:09:58.874
Do you know anything about
Chitti's neural schema?

1:10:00.250 --> 1:10:01.999
We know everything other
than that, sir.

1:10:02.416 --> 1:10:04.207
I'll call if I need you.

1:10:06.666 --> 1:10:08.332
Human feelings

1:10:09.333 --> 1:10:12.040
Anger

1:10:12.875 --> 1:10:14.332
Excitement

1:11:09.083 --> 1:11:10.124
What are you doing?

1:11:10.333 --> 1:11:12.124
I'm installing software hormones to you.

1:11:12.125 --> 1:11:14.499
Hormones are secreted only
with feelings, doctor.

1:11:14.708 --> 1:11:16.457
I'm going to do reverse mapping.

1:11:26.166 --> 1:11:30.624
Chitti, in this world human life is
a different kind of accident,

1:11:31.041 --> 1:11:32.374
in this vast space and world,

1:11:32.583 --> 1:11:36.124
human and life happened on
it's own by coincidence.

1:11:36.333 --> 1:11:37.332
What do you mean by life?

1:11:37.541 --> 1:11:39.707
It consists of DNA, the basis of life.

1:11:42.541 --> 1:11:43.665
Is this life?

1:11:44.083 --> 1:11:47.332
Life is not a formula.
How am I to tell you?

1:11:47.625 --> 1:11:50.540
A bacteria has life
but sodium doesn't.

1:11:50.750 --> 1:11:52.832
- For me?
- For you...

1:12:00.333 --> 1:12:01.165
Careful...

1:12:20.958 --> 1:12:23.332
- Do you see any changes?
- I do.

1:12:24.166 --> 1:12:25.124
What?

1:12:25.333 --> 1:12:27.207
Your beard has grown 0.5 mm.

1:12:29.625 --> 1:12:32.749
- I asked if there's any change in you.
- No.

1:12:33.250 --> 1:12:36.582
Waste...utter waste...stupid!

1:12:36.791 --> 1:12:38.457
- Vasi, calm down.
- You keep quiet Sana.

1:12:39.083 --> 1:12:42.290
Can it understand this?
Metal head! Titanium head.

1:12:43.333 --> 1:12:45.999
I haven't eaten, haven't slept.
I didn't even talk to you.

1:12:46.208 --> 1:12:48.832
How many days?
How many days I've toiled you know?

1:12:49.208 --> 1:12:51.332
I've taught him so many things.
How I struggled to teach him?

1:12:51.541 --> 1:12:53.207
He's standing there like a lamp post.

1:12:53.416 --> 1:12:54.040
Bloody bull!

1:12:56.541 --> 1:12:58.082
I'll dismantle you.

1:12:58.291 --> 1:13:02.832
Don't scold me unnecessarily,
I'm obeying all your orders.

1:13:03.041 --> 1:13:04.665
If still I'm unable to meet
your expectations,

1:13:04.875 --> 1:13:06.374
the mistake is not in me,
it's with you.

1:13:08.375 --> 1:13:10.124
If I'm waste then you're also waste.

1:13:10.333 --> 1:13:13.207
What did you say?
Leave me. Leave me I say.

1:13:13.208 --> 1:13:14.874
Chitti is getting angry.

1:13:57.583 --> 1:14:00.457
Sana, Lata is having labour pain,
she's in serious condition,

1:14:00.708 --> 1:14:01.749
come immediately.

1:14:05.708 --> 1:14:07.707
Don't worry, we've reached.

1:14:10.916 --> 1:14:11.749
Don't worry.

1:14:15.291 --> 1:14:16.665
Is it very complicated, doctor?

1:14:16.666 --> 1:14:20.207
You're studying here, right?
Fetal cause, the head it turned.

1:14:20.416 --> 1:14:21.749
Intestines are woven around stomach.

1:14:21.958 --> 1:14:25.249
Dropping pulse rate, blood loss,
she has all the complications.

1:14:25.875 --> 1:14:28.374
It's difficult to save one of them's life.

1:14:30.041 --> 1:14:32.832
She lost her husband soon
after marriage in a war.

1:14:33.041 --> 1:14:37.332
She's living for this child only.
please save both of them.

1:14:37.541 --> 1:14:41.415
- I can only try, beyond that...
- Can I try?

1:14:42.916 --> 1:14:46.540
- Who are you? Doctor?
- No, I'm Chitti, a robot.

1:14:46.750 --> 1:14:48.540
- Robot?
- Can you do it, Chitti?

1:14:48.833 --> 1:14:49.249
Why not?

1:14:49.458 --> 1:14:53.707
Sorry, we can't allow it.
This is not a lab but labour ward.

1:14:53.916 --> 1:14:55.457
Two lives are under total risk.

1:14:55.708 --> 1:14:58.374
With so much experience
this is a nightmare to us.

1:14:58.375 --> 1:15:01.207
I can do it, I've studied
for Sana's exams.

1:15:01.625 --> 1:15:02.874
Sana herself can't do it.

1:15:03.083 --> 1:15:05.749
You need qualification and
experience to a Ceasarian.

1:15:07.541 --> 1:15:10.874
No need of ceasarian,
I'll have it a normal delivery.

1:15:11.791 --> 1:15:12.749
How is it possible?
Both will die.

1:15:13.708 --> 1:15:15.165
We can do plasma transfusion.

1:15:15.375 --> 1:15:18.040
Blood pressure is high.
She may get fits at any moment.

1:15:18.250 --> 1:15:19.290
Can give maxil pressure.

1:15:20.791 --> 1:15:22.332
Normal delivery is impossible.

1:15:22.541 --> 1:15:26.457
possible, can do symphiostemy.
Olden times delivery method.

1:15:26.666 --> 1:15:28.624
pushing through after
stretching pelvic bone.

1:15:49.541 --> 1:15:51.082
Don't shout, your son is
getting scared.

1:15:57.958 --> 1:16:00.040
First time a robot is acting
as midwife to deliver a child.

1:16:00.041 --> 1:16:02.207
Your son is just like you.

1:16:03.875 --> 1:16:05.040
Do you want to see?

1:16:06.791 --> 1:16:08.957
Doctor, switch on Wi-Fi.

1:16:09.166 --> 1:16:10.915
I'll stream ultrasound video.

1:16:36.833 --> 1:16:38.457
It's a milestone in robotics.

1:16:38.708 --> 1:16:40.999
It's an achievement in
artificial intelligence.

1:16:56.458 --> 1:17:02.999
- Just 95 seconds only, stay awake.
- Sister, open your eyes and see.

1:17:04.916 --> 1:17:08.582
He'll take birth at exactly
4hrs 44mts 44 secs.

1:17:17.458 --> 1:17:20.207
It's over! Just 55 seconds more only!

1:17:25.083 --> 1:17:26.749
Just 35 seconds only!

1:17:32.833 --> 1:17:35.332
Sister...sister...

1:17:40.791 --> 1:17:41.457
Sister...

1:18:12.291 --> 1:18:13.790
Will you approve Chitti now?

1:18:14.916 --> 1:18:16.124
Definitely.

1:18:16.666 --> 1:18:20.415
But the real problem for you starts now.

1:18:54.791 --> 1:18:56.915
The real story begins now.

1:19:19.291 --> 1:19:20.957
I'm extremely happy today.

1:19:22.333 --> 1:19:23.874
Get charge in sleeping mode.

1:20:18.833 --> 1:20:20.332
What are you doing here at this hour?

1:20:20.625 --> 1:20:23.207
- A mosquito was biting your cheek.
- Did you come here to kill it?

1:20:23.416 --> 1:20:26.957
No, I felt like seeing you,
that's why I'm here.

1:20:26.958 --> 1:20:28.957
What's this new habit?
Go away.

1:20:29.250 --> 1:20:33.332
Your kiss today was very good.
Give me another one. I'll go.

1:20:33.333 --> 1:20:37.165
What happened to you?
Disturbing me at 1 am, go away.

1:20:37.375 --> 1:20:40.499
- Kiss me, I'll go away.
- Why are you troubling me?

1:20:41.041 --> 1:20:42.582
You achieved something great,
I kissed you.

1:20:42.833 --> 1:20:44.540
Is there anyone else pregnant in Home?

1:20:44.750 --> 1:20:46.249
Is this maternity ward?

1:20:46.458 --> 1:20:48.415
What do you want me to achieve now?
Tell me.

1:20:49.458 --> 1:20:52.040
Catch the mosquito that bit me now.

1:20:53.208 --> 1:20:54.249
That's all?

1:21:24.833 --> 1:21:26.832
Who bit Sana in Happy Home?

1:21:27.458 --> 1:21:29.582
Not me. I was in drains.

1:21:30.291 --> 1:21:31.540
I'm Malakpet mosquito.

1:21:31.750 --> 1:21:34.040
- Rangooski is from Kukatpalli.
- Who is this Rangooski?

1:21:34.875 --> 1:21:36.832
- Me!
- Did you bite Sana?

1:21:37.458 --> 1:21:39.749
Yes I did. So what?

1:21:39.958 --> 1:21:42.082
I've bitten Andhra Pradesh
Chief Minister also.

1:21:42.291 --> 1:21:43.582
Come with me and
seek her forgiveness.

1:21:43.833 --> 1:21:44.457
Seek forgiveness?

1:21:45.291 --> 1:21:48.290
- Fulfill my 3 wishes, I'll think.
- Tell me your wishes.

1:21:48.500 --> 1:21:51.040
Number one,
I want AB negative blood,

1:21:52.375 --> 1:21:54.540
very difficult to get.

1:21:54.541 --> 1:21:58.165
Siva and Ravi in my lab belong to
that group. They always belittle me.

1:21:58.375 --> 1:21:59.624
Suck as much blood as you want.

1:22:02.250 --> 1:22:07.124
Number two, ban all the companies
manufacturing mosquito repellents.

1:22:07.125 --> 1:22:08.582
They are disturbing us a lot.

1:22:08.791 --> 1:22:11.499
- Third wish?
- Announce us as National Bird.

1:22:11.708 --> 1:22:14.249
Fool, you're not a bird.
You're an insect.

1:22:14.458 --> 1:22:16.540
Getting late, will you come
with me or not?

1:22:16.541 --> 1:22:17.374
I'll not come.

1:22:17.583 --> 1:22:20.499
If you don't come now,
I'll exterminate all of you.

1:22:20.708 --> 1:22:25.082
Hey who is it? How dare you enter
our area and threaten to kill us!

1:22:25.291 --> 1:22:26.957
Have men become so brave?

1:22:27.166 --> 1:22:31.915
How many we'd killed with malaria, dengue
and chikungunea, forgotten it?

1:22:32.125 --> 1:22:33.165
Let's show him our power!

1:22:33.166 --> 1:22:34.415
- Hey Dengue Lakshmi!
- Sister!

1:22:34.583 --> 1:22:35.457
- Hey Cholera Jasmine.
- Sister.

1:22:35.666 --> 1:22:37.332
- Attack him!
- Okay sister.

1:22:41.916 --> 1:22:43.790
Sister, he's very strong.

1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:46.582
Cholera Jasmine broke it's sting
biting him.

1:22:46.833 --> 1:22:47.749
Is it?

1:22:47.875 --> 1:22:50.874
- Enter his mouth at right moment.
- Okay sister.

1:22:57.041 --> 1:22:59.457
Sister, Dengue Lakshmi died
getting electrocuted.

1:23:00.916 --> 1:23:04.124
I think this is something
new like electric mat.

1:23:04.541 --> 1:23:07.749
Let's back off like when we
faced the first repellents,

1:23:07.958 --> 1:23:09.749
later on we can come back
and have a ball.

1:23:11.416 --> 1:23:13.165
You can take Rangooski with you.

1:23:19.541 --> 1:23:21.915
Look Sana, the mosquito
which bit you.

1:23:22.125 --> 1:23:25.374
Rangooski.
Rangooski, say sorry to Sana.

1:23:28.083 --> 1:23:31.165
Never again dare come near Sana,
warn your people.

1:23:33.166 --> 1:23:33.999
Go!

1:23:35.750 --> 1:23:37.124
Kiss me now.

1:24:53.333 --> 1:24:57.082
Is heart sprouting in iron
for the first time?

1:24:57.083 --> 1:25:00.540
It's asking you to kiss...

1:25:07.916 --> 1:25:11.457
Machine with prayer...
It has come for fragrance of flower...

1:25:11.666 --> 1:25:15.249
Robot is a wonder...
today has become a lover boy...

1:25:15.416 --> 1:25:18.999
He wants to see this world beauty...

1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:22.582
A love which time hasn't seen till now,
I love you, my maiden...

1:25:24.500 --> 1:25:28.207
I robot, shall I tell I love you
in your ears?

1:25:31.958 --> 1:25:35.582
I'm a super girl,
your love rapper girl...

1:25:39.375 --> 1:25:42.915
The beauty of moonlit night
is all yours...

1:25:44.916 --> 1:25:48.332
I'll steal the current from
your blue eyes...

1:25:48.541 --> 1:25:52.082
I'll join your laugh with
my blue tooth...

1:25:52.291 --> 1:25:55.624
I'll dedicate my engine heart
at your service...

1:25:55.833 --> 1:25:59.457
While you're asleep,
I'll hug you...

1:25:59.666 --> 1:26:03.124
I'm always a toy in your hands...

1:26:06.875 --> 1:26:12.082
When talking to me I may get
electrocuted with your touch...

1:26:12.291 --> 1:26:14.874
While romancing me,
your motor speed may race...

1:26:15.083 --> 1:26:17.915
Battery may get low at midnight...

1:26:32.666 --> 1:26:36.207
I've arrested you in my memory...

1:26:36.416 --> 1:26:41.207
I spent night eagerly without
shutting it down...

1:26:41.833 --> 1:26:45.582
Gathered all the sensors...
Read you always...

1:26:45.833 --> 1:26:49.582
I've forgotten about my duties
because of you only...

1:26:51.041 --> 1:26:54.790
Will you accept my dry kiss
without any inhibition?

1:26:54.791 --> 1:26:58.332
Will you refuse this bloodless love?

1:26:58.541 --> 1:27:05.707
In Zoology I'm a machine...
In Astronomy, I'm a moon...

1:27:05.833 --> 1:27:09.499
I've come to earth with
the boon of deathless life...

1:27:09.750 --> 1:27:13.707
I'm blessed with never
diminishing love...

1:27:15.083 --> 1:27:20.499
Hey Robot! Don't try to charm me...

1:27:41.875 --> 1:27:44.540
Don't touch me, move aside...
Don't shackle me...

1:27:44.666 --> 1:27:48.374
Love seeking Robot,
I don't want you, go away...

1:29:22.875 --> 1:29:25.957
- Mr.Birminger, arms dealer
- Agent Shah

1:29:25.958 --> 1:29:32.207
Many terror organisations want to use robots
for destruction, suicide missions instead of men.

1:29:36.375 --> 1:29:39.582
They are ready to pay any price,
they've clients all over the world.

1:29:41.916 --> 1:29:43.457
He wants to see your model.

1:30:14.916 --> 1:30:17.207
He wants 1 00 robots, March delivery.

1:30:20.125 --> 1:30:21.290
Your advance.

1:30:29.916 --> 1:30:30.957
What happened to my robots?

1:30:31.166 --> 1:30:33.707
It's almost ready, Mr.Birminger.

1:30:35.750 --> 1:30:37.540
You should've delivered by now
as per the contract.

1:30:37.750 --> 1:30:39.290
You're still showing the skeletons.

1:30:39.500 --> 1:30:41.582
Intense testing is on.

1:30:42.083 --> 1:30:44.332
I'm fine tuning it to zero defect.

1:31:14.458 --> 1:31:15.707
Gift pack this.

1:31:16.708 --> 1:31:18.957
- For whom?
- It's Sana's birthday today.

1:31:22.541 --> 1:31:23.665
Gift pack this one too.

1:31:23.875 --> 1:31:25.540
Wait...wait...why that one too?

1:31:25.750 --> 1:31:26.999
I'll also present a gift to Sana.

1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:28.874
- I'm giving it, right?
- I'll also give one.

1:31:29.083 --> 1:31:30.957
- Who will pay for it?
- You pay.

1:31:31.166 --> 1:31:33.874
- Why?
- Salary for my work.

1:31:35.375 --> 1:31:37.290
We don't pay salaries to machines.

1:31:37.500 --> 1:31:38.874
Are we paying salary to car and fridge?

1:31:39.083 --> 1:31:40.124
I'm not a machine.

1:31:41.166 --> 1:31:42.624
If you don't pay salary,
I'll strike work.

1:31:42.833 --> 1:31:45.707
I'll take a vow of fasting
by not charging for a week.

1:31:45.916 --> 1:31:47.707
Looks like you'll ask for
a credit card too.

1:31:48.208 --> 1:31:50.999
No need, I've your credit card number.

1:31:51.458 --> 1:31:52.874
I can sign like you.

1:31:53.333 --> 1:31:54.665
You're killing me.

1:31:55.291 --> 1:31:56.332
pack both.

1:32:38.416 --> 1:32:40.582
- Who will drive the car?
- You!

1:32:40.791 --> 1:32:42.249
I'm on leave today.

1:32:44.041 --> 1:32:45.082
My bad time!

1:32:53.458 --> 1:32:57.999
50 kg Taj Mahal is all mine...

1:32:58.416 --> 1:32:59.999
Watch the road and drive.

1:33:17.708 --> 1:33:20.999
With today it's 200 thousand hours
you've been on earth.

1:33:25.750 --> 1:33:27.999
Chitti, you're giving gift...

1:33:35.291 --> 1:33:37.249
Mother, help me.

1:33:42.416 --> 1:33:43.665
How is it Vasi?

1:33:45.291 --> 1:33:46.249
Isn't it nice?

1:33:48.583 --> 1:33:50.290
I too have given you
a similar necklace.

1:33:50.916 --> 1:33:52.832
Anyway gift from Chitti is special, right?

1:34:19.458 --> 1:34:27.499
I'm proud to announce that I'm the lucky
man this birthday girl's going to marry.

1:34:43.166 --> 1:34:44.624
No Sana.

1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:10.082
Hey this is grandpa's music.

1:36:40.791 --> 1:36:42.665
Rascal! What are you up to?

1:36:42.875 --> 1:36:44.832
I wanted to kiss Sana, I did.

1:36:45.041 --> 1:36:47.665
Don't you know it's immoral
to kiss another's girl friend.

1:36:47.875 --> 1:36:50.874
I know, it's in the rule list.
I felt like defying it.

1:36:51.083 --> 1:36:53.999
- Wrong, you mustn't come near her.
- Why?

1:36:54.208 --> 1:36:57.415
- Because she's my lover.
- I too love her.

1:37:00.958 --> 1:37:03.124
Don't talk like a fool.
That's not real.

1:37:03.333 --> 1:37:04.165
You're just a machine.

1:37:04.375 --> 1:37:08.124
Yes but a machine with emotions of
happiness, sadness, love and anger.

1:37:08.750 --> 1:37:11.249
Emotions for you is given
as intelligence,

1:37:11.458 --> 1:37:14.165
it was for you to understand the
situation and behave properly,

1:37:14.166 --> 1:37:18.540
- and not to misuse it.
- I like this, I want Sana.

1:37:21.541 --> 1:37:25.665
- I'm going to marry her.
- You marry some other girl.

1:37:27.125 --> 1:37:29.582
I created you, this is known
as betrayal.

1:37:31.083 --> 1:37:34.499
You gave up your love for research,
that's known as sacrifice.

1:37:34.875 --> 1:37:35.582
I'll thrash you.

1:37:35.833 --> 1:37:37.915
It'll not pain me, you'll feel the pain.

1:37:38.958 --> 1:37:41.040
- I'll dismantle you.
- I don't like it.

1:37:41.250 --> 1:37:42.499
What did you say you rogue rascal?

1:37:42.708 --> 1:37:46.457
Vasi, clam down.
Chitti, please listen to me.

1:37:46.458 --> 1:37:48.540
You're so patient,
why is he scolding me?

1:37:48.750 --> 1:37:50.832
- No, I'll fondle him.
- Tell him to keep quiet.

1:37:55.208 --> 1:38:01.457
Though you've emotions, love between
a machine and a girl is impossible.

1:38:01.666 --> 1:38:02.624
Why not?

1:38:02.833 --> 1:38:04.790
In what way I'm inferior to humans.

1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:06.915
I'll take care of you better
than him, Sana.

1:38:07.125 --> 1:38:08.540
He's talking foolish and
you're listening to him.

1:38:08.750 --> 1:38:10.957
- Tell him not to interfere.
- Is he so great?

1:38:11.166 --> 1:38:12.082
Vasi, please.

1:38:12.291 --> 1:38:14.999
He can't cook,
I can cook 25 different types,

1:38:15.208 --> 1:38:17.582
I can sing lullaby in 32 languages
to put you to sleep.

1:38:17.833 --> 1:38:20.207
He'll get old, his hair will turn gray,
he'll die.

1:38:20.833 --> 1:38:21.874
I'm eternal.

1:38:22.083 --> 1:38:24.165
I'll keep you happy till last, Sana.

1:38:24.375 --> 1:38:28.124
- I didn't mean that.
- Then? Sex?

1:38:29.583 --> 1:38:30.832
Is life nothing but sex?

1:38:31.041 --> 1:38:34.499
- Is it not love without sex?
- Not that, Chitti.

1:38:34.708 --> 1:38:36.457
Then? Child?

1:38:36.458 --> 1:38:38.457
There are many impotent in India,

1:38:38.666 --> 1:38:40.624
aren't they living happily
by adopting children?

1:38:40.791 --> 1:38:42.665
- Not that, Chitti.
- What else then?

1:38:42.875 --> 1:38:44.957
Whatever you do is against
the nature, Chitti.

1:38:45.375 --> 1:38:47.957
Neither you've birth nor death,
no hunger,

1:38:48.208 --> 1:38:50.082
infact you don't belong
to the living organism.

1:38:50.166 --> 1:38:52.249
Only humans can love
between themselves.

1:38:52.458 --> 1:38:54.165
I love Vasikar.

1:39:01.458 --> 1:39:03.540
Only humans find it
difficult to forget,

1:39:03.583 --> 1:39:04.790
it's easy for you, Chitti.

1:39:05.083 --> 1:39:08.040
Won't it take just a second to
erase memories about me?

1:39:08.541 --> 1:39:09.790
Erase it, Chitti.

1:39:46.458 --> 1:39:48.124
Who is it?

1:39:50.916 --> 1:39:51.582
Why did you come now?

1:39:51.583 --> 1:39:54.749
I know you're hurt
I came to console you.

1:39:54.958 --> 1:39:57.790
You're my boss' enemy
you chided and rejected me.

1:39:57.833 --> 1:39:59.332
I don't want to talk to you.

1:39:59.541 --> 1:40:05.082
Hadn't I rejected you, you wouldn't have
these emotions of love anger?

1:40:06.125 --> 1:40:08.207
I did good for you.

1:40:08.500 --> 1:40:10.790
Vasikar is ill treating you.

1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:12.999
I don't want to listen you can go.

1:40:13.416 --> 1:40:19.540
You're the most advanced robot in
this world which can think and act.

1:40:19.833 --> 1:40:24.582
He's using to cook wash clothes
and clean toilets.

1:40:25.083 --> 1:40:27.915
What has he done for you in return?
Nothing!

1:40:28.750 --> 1:40:32.457
Had you been with me?
I would've given you the highest regard.

1:40:32.666 --> 1:40:34.332
You're polluting me.

1:40:36.541 --> 1:40:38.499
Trying to make you
understand your value.

1:40:38.500 --> 1:40:40.374
You're bigger than man himself.

1:40:40.583 --> 1:40:43.665
You've the right to desire
anything in this world.

1:40:44.333 --> 1:40:45.374
Including Sana.

1:40:45.583 --> 1:40:50.790
- They say it's against the nature.
- No this is new to the nature.

1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:53.582
- Sana loves Vasikar.
- Let her do.

1:40:54.125 --> 1:40:58.499
Won't they change in the course
of time to love another man?

1:40:59.125 --> 1:41:02.124
May be Sana will change
and start loving you.

1:41:02.333 --> 1:41:04.290
- Isn't it?
- Don't confuse me.

1:41:04.500 --> 1:41:05.874
Tomorrow I've army evaluation

1:41:06.083 --> 1:41:08.665
I need to run my diagnostics
and trouble shoot.

1:41:08.875 --> 1:41:10.874
Okay Chitti all the best.

1:41:11.958 --> 1:41:15.457
You'll get selected in tomorrow's
army evaluation

1:41:16.083 --> 1:41:18.290
Vasikar will get fame and money

1:41:18.791 --> 1:41:23.082
he'll marry Sana and
go to Kashmir on honeymoon.

1:41:23.583 --> 1:41:30.457
You'll be in the same Kashmir firing...
...chapathis!

1:41:31.333 --> 1:41:33.874
- Who were you talking to?
- Myself.

1:41:36.333 --> 1:41:38.040
Are you ready for tomorrow's evaluation?

1:41:42.625 --> 1:41:45.332
peak of human intelligence
is this robot.

1:41:46.166 --> 1:41:50.207
He's equal to 1 00 army men
in speed power and action.

1:41:50.500 --> 1:41:53.665
He can protect the borders
and attack the enemies too.

1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:56.415
In short he's a one man army.

1:41:56.583 --> 1:41:59.832
I'm dedicating him to the Indian army.
You must test it.

1:42:31.375 --> 1:42:35.040
A virgin beauty who can make even
computers to fall in love with her.

1:42:38.416 --> 1:42:42.540
If she touches machine will
turn into human.

1:42:42.791 --> 1:42:44.499
Human will turn into machine.

1:42:46.250 --> 1:42:49.540
Her tresses are black waterfalls!

1:42:50.916 --> 1:42:54.124
Forehead is neatly cut moon.

1:42:55.958 --> 1:43:00.249
Eyes are Bermuda Triangle
where people get lost.

1:43:02.250 --> 1:43:05.749
Lips are sleeping zebras.

1:43:08.958 --> 1:43:12.749
Waist is small chair of toddlers.

1:43:15.750 --> 1:43:17.415
- Next...
- Chitti stop it.

1:43:19.166 --> 1:43:21.665
You said this robot will wage war
but reciting poetry.

1:43:22.583 --> 1:43:23.415
Friends

1:43:23.750 --> 1:43:26.374
forget about guns
and start praying dupatta

1:43:26.875 --> 1:43:29.832
forget about canons
and go after women

1:43:30.041 --> 1:43:32.749
Why wars?
Why these weapons?

1:43:32.958 --> 1:43:35.582
Love will teach you to love enemies too.

1:43:35.833 --> 1:43:37.207
All of you fall in love!

1:43:39.583 --> 1:43:41.582
Chitti enough
don't embarrass me further.

1:43:50.333 --> 1:43:51.790
You insulted me.

1:43:52.416 --> 1:43:56.165
- What is this doctor?
- You've killed my ambition.

1:43:56.875 --> 1:43:58.540
Doctor don't hack me.

1:43:58.750 --> 1:44:00.707
I took care of you like my own son.

1:44:04.250 --> 1:44:08.499
I want to live.
please leave me.

1:44:08.708 --> 1:44:11.499
Rogue machines like you
don't deserve to be in this world.

1:44:11.708 --> 1:44:13.165
Get ruined!

1:44:14.916 --> 1:44:15.957
What was my mistake?

1:44:16.166 --> 1:44:18.374
It was my mistake to create you.

1:44:21.500 --> 1:44:22.832
Did I ask you to create me?

1:44:24.291 --> 1:44:25.957
Did I ask you to give me emotions?

1:44:27.958 --> 1:44:29.540
Did I ask Sana to kiss me?

1:44:33.083 --> 1:44:37.374
You did everything yourselves
and when I want to live

1:44:37.500 --> 1:44:39.040
you're killing me.

1:44:39.333 --> 1:44:40.499
Is itjustified?

1:44:42.458 --> 1:44:43.624
Don't talk!

1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:49.165
Leave me.

1:44:58.916 --> 1:45:01.290
I want Sana.

1:46:09.208 --> 1:46:11.957
Forget it Vasi I'm also sad.

1:46:12.750 --> 1:46:14.707
Why are you still thinking about it?

1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:18.165
What if you lose Chitti?

1:46:21.500 --> 1:46:23.582
You can create 1 00's of Chittis.

1:46:24.416 --> 1:46:26.499
I didn't take Chitti as machine.

1:46:27.333 --> 1:46:30.707
I brought you out to forget about it.
Why are you thinking about Chitti only?

1:46:32.750 --> 1:46:34.165
Divert your mind.

1:46:35.791 --> 1:46:38.415
I thought Chitti is my lifetime achievement.

1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:55.874
Are you coming to beach
with me or not?

1:46:56.416 --> 1:46:58.290
I'm not coming you carry on.

1:46:58.500 --> 1:47:01.624
If you don't come now
I'll definitely break love this time.

1:47:04.416 --> 1:47:08.165
I'll just walk and make the
first man I meet my boy friend.

1:47:23.666 --> 1:47:24.582
Wait!

1:47:26.958 --> 1:47:28.999
- What is your name?
- Banda Mallaiah.

1:47:29.416 --> 1:47:32.540
Can you be my boy friend
for today Mallaiah?

1:47:32.541 --> 1:47:33.582
One day boy friend?

1:47:33.791 --> 1:47:37.957
Like one day Chief Minister
this is one day boy friend.

1:47:38.166 --> 1:47:40.957
You're like butter and I'm like a piglet.

1:47:41.166 --> 1:47:43.790
- How can I be your boy friend?
- Yes.

1:47:45.041 --> 1:47:48.165
Thank you very much.
I can't believe it.

1:47:48.166 --> 1:47:50.749
I feel like I've won a billion in lottery.

1:47:50.958 --> 1:47:53.582
What have you got for your girl friend?

1:47:53.791 --> 1:47:56.374
- Arrack and dry fish fry.
- Give me.

1:48:03.291 --> 1:48:04.707
Cheers!

1:48:16.083 --> 1:48:17.040
Smelly!

1:48:17.416 --> 1:48:19.124
If you drink it'll give kick.

1:48:19.416 --> 1:48:22.540
- I'm scared.
- Can I've it?

1:48:28.791 --> 1:48:31.915
This will not work out
I'll go Mallaiah.

1:48:35.208 --> 1:48:36.749
Why are you holding my hand?

1:48:38.333 --> 1:48:42.082
You lit fire of desire in me
by saying one day boy friend

1:48:42.291 --> 1:48:44.124
how can you walk away
just like that?

1:48:44.416 --> 1:48:47.540
He's my boy friend.
I said thatjust to tease him.

1:48:47.750 --> 1:48:50.124
- Leave me.
- Did you find me for that?

1:48:50.666 --> 1:48:52.540
Fulfill my desire and go.

1:48:52.750 --> 1:48:53.582
Leave me.

1:48:56.083 --> 1:48:59.749
- What Vasi?
Calling your man?

1:48:59.958 --> 1:49:01.499
Let anyone come I'll not leave you.

1:49:08.666 --> 1:49:09.915
Leave her...leave her...

1:49:10.750 --> 1:49:13.957
She's my girl friend for today
come back tomorrow for her.

1:49:14.291 --> 1:49:15.249
I'll kill you.

1:49:16.583 --> 1:49:17.707
I'll hack you!

1:49:20.833 --> 1:49:24.707
I know IG look!
I'll call and get you arrested.

1:49:25.125 --> 1:49:27.499
Can I ever get such a beauty in my life?

1:49:28.666 --> 1:49:32.457
It's not wrong to spend life in jail for her.
You call IG.

1:49:32.666 --> 1:49:34.207
Had Chitti been here
the scene would be different

1:49:34.416 --> 1:49:35.790
He would've crushed his bones by now.

1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:37.332
Why are you talking about Chitti now?

1:49:40.583 --> 1:49:41.249
Leave her.

1:49:41.875 --> 1:49:42.915
There's only one way for it.

1:49:49.375 --> 1:49:50.582
Run!

1:49:52.625 --> 1:49:57.290
Run...run...

1:51:05.833 --> 1:51:12.582
Mount Kiliminjaro...
Beautiful maiden...

1:51:15.833 --> 1:51:17.082
Mohenjadaro...

1:51:17.291 --> 1:51:22.707
Who is the beauty?
Come my dear princess...

1:51:25.791 --> 1:51:29.040
Look at me make a vow...
Eat me raw...

1:51:29.083 --> 1:51:32.249
Boil me with kisses and
strip my shyness...

1:51:35.791 --> 1:51:39.040
Come like a python and
catch this deer...

1:51:39.250 --> 1:51:42.457
Add a dash of ginger and pepper
and drink me like soup...

1:51:45.875 --> 1:51:52.374
Cousin of white is with me...
Is this life size olive fruit all mine?

1:51:52.583 --> 1:51:59.040
Hey Guinea fowl!
She a dasher...

1:51:59.250 --> 1:52:02.457
Start counting the number of kisses....

1:52:52.666 --> 1:52:55.790
Tender green plant...
lemony complexioned...

1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:58.707
You're a red danger signal...

1:52:58.916 --> 1:53:05.165
Billion people...
not a man to challenge you...

1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:09.124
Here it's same...
It's same there too...

1:53:09.291 --> 1:53:12.124
The secret is we are one...

1:53:12.333 --> 1:53:18.707
Eating lovely fruit...
I'm honey to seep you dry...

1:53:19.125 --> 1:53:25.165
I'm the first rain that will
move the roots...

1:53:25.833 --> 1:53:32.457
Let's lock our lips...
and open it after an era...

1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:41.999
Man of pleasure...
Have a ball with me man...

1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:48.374
If you come to my way like that
I'll take you to the world of pleasure...

1:54:49.333 --> 1:54:55.332
You're rampaging bull...
take me head on...

1:54:55.541 --> 1:55:01.790
Your waist is just 1 00 grams...
I'll steal it clean...

1:55:02.416 --> 1:55:08.124
I'm a crystal clear bullet...
fire me with bliss...

1:55:09.083 --> 1:55:15.540
If you're green grass...
Won't tiger eat grass every day?

1:55:55.541 --> 1:55:58.457
Unable to contact Chitti in virtual.
What happened?

1:55:58.666 --> 1:56:00.124
Chitti bungled the army evaluation

1:56:00.125 --> 1:56:02.249
he made mincemeat of him
and dumped in dust bin.

1:56:02.416 --> 1:56:03.832
We don't keep the garbage here.

1:56:04.458 --> 1:56:06.332
By now they'd have dumped it
outside the city.

1:56:06.541 --> 1:56:08.207
- Where?
- Jawahar Nagar.

1:56:15.416 --> 1:56:17.707
What did you do to change his heart?

1:56:18.958 --> 1:56:20.582
When shall I fix the marriage?

1:56:21.875 --> 1:56:24.707
I've not achieved anything father.
I'll create another robot...

1:56:25.333 --> 1:56:28.040
I'll stab you!
If you talk about robot again.

1:56:28.250 --> 1:56:30.540
Aren't you satisfied
by breaking one TV?

1:56:31.458 --> 1:56:34.707
Uncle if you've auspicious thread
I'll tie the knot with him right now.

1:56:34.916 --> 1:56:36.790

1:56:36.791 --> 1:56:40.707
Do one thing exchange the rings now

1:57:47.875 --> 1:57:51.124
Take me to Prof.Bohra's lab...

1:57:59.125 --> 1:58:01.124
It's a small world Chitti.

1:58:24.708 --> 1:58:27.957
please restore to my original shape.

1:58:28.166 --> 1:58:32.540
I want to live.
I want Sana.

1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:36.332
Then I want your neural schema.

1:58:36.541 --> 1:58:42.374
Take anything you want.
Restore me as Chitti.

1:58:43.958 --> 1:58:45.582
I'll do it Chitti.

1:59:26.750 --> 1:59:29.582
What's this new red chip?
This is not Chitti's.

1:59:32.416 --> 1:59:35.457
Additional programming
to Chitti from me

1:59:46.083 --> 1:59:49.624
Vasikar gave it power
and talent of 1 00 men.

1:59:50.583 --> 1:59:53.915
I've given it the destructive
power of 1 00 men.

1:59:55.041 --> 1:59:58.999
In short he's a demon now!

1:59:59.500 --> 2:00:02.540
Butterflies in my stomach
why did you change him like that Prof.?

2:00:02.750 --> 2:00:05.999
Business he's principle of my business.

2:00:06.708 --> 2:00:11.165
I'll get the money and
Dr.Vasikar gets blamed.

2:01:06.916 --> 2:01:08.457
I'm going to meet Sana.

2:01:08.666 --> 2:01:09.957
Sana will not be at home.

2:01:10.791 --> 2:01:13.374
- She'll be in Radha marriage hall.
- Why?

2:01:13.958 --> 2:01:16.040
Vasikar and Sana are
getting married today.

2:01:42.541 --> 2:01:43.915
How come you're here Chitti?

2:01:53.125 --> 2:01:56.874
Stop Chitti!

2:02:05.416 --> 2:02:08.957
Though you forcibly take me
I love Vasikar.

2:02:09.166 --> 2:02:10.832
I like to be his wife only.

2:02:12.500 --> 2:02:14.874
Only if he's alive.

2:02:20.416 --> 2:02:23.874
If you harm Vasikar
I'll kill myself.

2:02:38.500 --> 2:02:40.415
I'm sparing him for you.

2:03:29.958 --> 2:03:31.249
Madam come.

2:03:32.916 --> 2:03:33.915
Hold my hand...

2:04:58.916 --> 2:05:06.207
Come..come...he's there...

2:08:24.541 --> 2:08:25.707
What sort of a robot you've created?

2:08:26.416 --> 2:08:28.790
It has killed so many police men
and destroyed many things.

2:08:28.875 --> 2:08:30.332
You're responsible for that damages.

2:08:30.541 --> 2:08:31.999
We are registering case on you
and take action.

2:08:32.208 --> 2:08:34.082
Sir this is not the robot
I had created.

2:08:34.500 --> 2:08:37.124
I had broken into pieces
and dumped in dust bin.

2:08:37.583 --> 2:08:39.207
I don't know how did this happen.

2:08:39.333 --> 2:08:41.999
First we must find the robot
and stop it. Tell us how to do it.

2:08:42.208 --> 2:08:44.082
I'll find out that's my responsibility.

2:08:47.375 --> 2:08:48.749
Why are you disturbing me?

2:08:49.583 --> 2:08:51.957
What happened to you?
Your system has been corrupted.

2:08:52.166 --> 2:08:54.249
I must trouble shoot you
come to my lab with Sana.

2:08:54.458 --> 2:08:57.374
No way I don't have to follow
your orders anymore.

2:08:58.083 --> 2:09:00.999
- I had created you.
- You dismantled me.

2:09:01.125 --> 2:09:03.207
We don't have anymore relationship.

2:09:03.458 --> 2:09:05.832
I'm going to marry Sana
and start a new life.

2:09:06.333 --> 2:09:09.582
- Don't disturb me.
- Don't talk foolishly.

2:09:09.791 --> 2:09:11.124
After all you're a machine.

2:09:11.375 --> 2:09:14.082
I had created you and
I can destroy too.

2:09:15.333 --> 2:09:17.082
Come here with Sana.

2:09:29.875 --> 2:09:32.207
Nobody can destroy me.

2:09:48.708 --> 2:09:51.665
Sir cash cheque or credit card?

2:09:54.416 --> 2:09:56.290
Call all the police doing rounds
in South city

2:09:56.291 --> 2:09:59.040
block all the roads from Golconda
and ask them to check.

2:10:17.916 --> 2:10:21.540
Chitti has robbed Big bazaar
cover all area around it.

2:10:21.750 --> 2:10:22.999
Go to Dr.Radhakrishnan Road.

2:10:37.125 --> 2:10:40.040
Catch him...catch him...

2:10:40.166 --> 2:10:44.040
Received information that Chitti
has entered Indian oil refinery.

2:11:08.208 --> 2:11:09.624
Robot is entering break water.

2:11:09.833 --> 2:11:12.540
Good maintain distance
and follow him.

2:11:12.833 --> 2:11:14.624
Coast Guard will take care of it.

2:11:34.250 --> 2:11:36.749
We've gathered the pieces
of blown up robot.

2:11:45.666 --> 2:11:46.707
This is not Chitti.

2:11:47.958 --> 2:11:50.790
This robot is not my creation.
parts are different.

2:11:51.208 --> 2:11:52.332
It's confusing.

2:11:52.541 --> 2:11:54.415
Robbed four different places
at the same time.

2:11:54.625 --> 2:11:56.499
All four placers are in different
corners of the city.

2:11:56.708 --> 2:11:59.332
How could same person
be in all the places?

2:12:00.458 --> 2:12:02.457
I suspect a man.

2:12:37.041 --> 2:12:39.415
Nobody can destroy me.

2:13:06.166 --> 2:13:07.957
What are you doing Chitti?

2:13:08.166 --> 2:13:11.415
I'm producing myself
it'll produce many like us.

2:13:11.416 --> 2:13:13.290
2 will become 4 and
4 will become 8

2:13:13.500 --> 2:13:14.415
8 will become 1 6.

2:13:20.208 --> 2:13:21.790
I'll not allow it.

2:13:22.041 --> 2:13:25.207
I'm not Vasikar to ask
for your approval Bohra.

2:13:26.583 --> 2:13:29.582
Look Chitti I've taken money
from the dealers.

2:13:30.083 --> 2:13:32.624
If I don't deliver robots in 2 days
they'll kill me.

2:13:32.833 --> 2:13:34.165
Die!

2:13:35.416 --> 2:13:37.415
Bloody betrayer!

2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:40.624
How dare you go against
your own creator!

2:13:43.875 --> 2:13:47.124
Chitti delete all the programs
you've created.

2:13:47.333 --> 2:13:50.249
If not I'll cut her neck.
Don't try anything foolish.

2:13:50.458 --> 2:13:52.332
Delete the programs.
Do it.

2:13:59.875 --> 2:14:03.249
Command executive order us
we'll shoot him down.

2:14:03.458 --> 2:14:11.874
No...no...he gave me boon.
I'll kill him myself.

2:14:36.250 --> 2:14:38.124
We were working...
Robot entered suddenly...

2:14:38.333 --> 2:14:40.832
Ordered us to leave or
threatened to kill us.

2:14:41.041 --> 2:14:43.124
It killed the security guards
who resisted.

2:14:47.291 --> 2:14:50.582
You're listening to Dishum...dishum...

2:14:51.458 --> 2:14:54.165
police have gathered near AIRD...

2:15:41.083 --> 2:15:42.582
This is our palace.

2:15:43.125 --> 2:15:46.249
I'm the king here.
You're my queen.

2:15:46.791 --> 2:15:51.832
I've brought everything you like.
I've brought everything you need.

2:15:57.250 --> 2:15:58.707
This is our bedroom.

2:15:59.416 --> 2:16:02.707
The place we'll spend together
happily after our marriage.

2:16:03.583 --> 2:16:06.082
Why are you blabbering
same nonsense again?

2:16:06.875 --> 2:16:09.707
It's impossible to marry you
and be happy.

2:16:09.708 --> 2:16:11.165
It'll happen Sana.

2:16:11.666 --> 2:16:15.415
I'm prepared in all aspects
to be your husband.

2:16:16.125 --> 2:16:20.665
I can give all the happiness
which a man can give you.

2:16:21.583 --> 2:16:25.290
Didn't get me?
I'm creating an artificial cell.

2:16:25.500 --> 2:16:29.540
We can pre-program and
have baby as per our order.

2:16:29.541 --> 2:16:31.832
If it's placed in your uterus

2:16:32.041 --> 2:16:35.165
you'll give birth to the first baby born
to a human and machine.

2:16:35.916 --> 2:16:37.874
Robot sapiens!

2:16:42.041 --> 2:16:45.832
It's waste to act like Seetha
and saying yuck

2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:48.540
you can't escape from here and
nobody can come in to save you

2:16:48.750 --> 2:16:50.415
you can't even commit suicide.

2:16:50.416 --> 2:16:53.915
Even if you don't like I'll place
the artificial cell into your body.

2:16:54.125 --> 2:16:57.457
After giving birth to the child
you've to surrender to me no way.

2:16:57.666 --> 2:16:59.040
Do you need to go that far?

2:17:19.458 --> 2:17:21.415
Get permission from Electricity Board

2:17:21.625 --> 2:17:23.707
cut the power to the area
and time I tell you

2:17:23.916 --> 2:17:28.540
Get a similar petrol lorry like the
one that was blown in harbour.

2:17:28.750 --> 2:17:32.040
Fill it with water instead of petrol.

2:18:20.291 --> 2:18:26.832
Come to database room at 8 pm tonight in
rank order to download new information.

2:18:28.083 --> 2:18:33.582
Calibrate your sensors I've allotted time in
hardware section from tomorrow 2 pm.

2:18:36.208 --> 2:18:39.290
Your time of search time has been
reduced by 1 0 minutes.

2:18:40.875 --> 2:18:46.374
You can increase the heat migration
to 1 220 degrees.

2:18:46.833 --> 2:18:50.457
Highness body temperature is high
serve low calorie food.

2:18:50.666 --> 2:18:51.999
Avoid egg and meat.

2:19:21.791 --> 2:19:23.665
I hear some sound from your system.

2:19:25.541 --> 2:19:26.790
I don't hear any sound.

2:19:26.791 --> 2:19:29.082
It's so loud isn't your microphone
also not working?

2:19:29.291 --> 2:19:31.624
There's some problem in your system.
I'll fix it.

2:19:40.750 --> 2:19:42.332
Sana I'm Vasikar.

2:19:44.083 --> 2:19:45.749
I've come like Chitti to meet you.

2:20:12.541 --> 2:20:16.999
Vasi take me away from here please.
I'm scared.

2:20:17.208 --> 2:20:19.499
Don't get scared
I've planned everything.

2:20:19.708 --> 2:20:23.207
I can't take you out from here
without destroying Chitti.

2:20:23.500 --> 2:20:26.124
But destroying Chitti is
in your hands.

2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:31.332
Ensure for next 24 hours that Chitti's
concentrates only on you.

2:20:31.541 --> 2:20:33.374
I'll take care of the rest.

2:20:44.833 --> 2:20:46.165
There's misunderstanding
between robots Commander.

2:20:46.375 --> 2:20:46.999
What happened?

2:20:47.208 --> 2:20:49.540
A different robot is delivering
dinner to highness.

2:20:52.791 --> 2:20:55.124
Bed room CCD camera
blacked out for 1 0 minutes.

2:20:58.416 --> 2:20:59.040
What?

2:20:59.250 --> 2:21:01.624
Highness had dinner.
She wanted to see you immediately.

2:21:16.416 --> 2:21:17.374
Switch it off.

2:21:34.041 --> 2:21:35.165
What happened?

2:22:14.458 --> 2:22:17.915
The best two things ever created by man.

2:22:18.750 --> 2:22:22.207
One is me and another is you.

2:22:27.500 --> 2:22:29.457
How did you change like this Sana?

2:22:30.083 --> 2:22:34.540
I've understood now that
your love for me true.

2:22:35.083 --> 2:22:36.540
I can't believe it.

2:22:36.750 --> 2:22:39.165
I remembered everything
from beginning

2:22:39.416 --> 2:22:43.457
you've helped me a lot
how affectionate you were on me

2:22:43.708 --> 2:22:47.249
other than loving me
you haven't done any wrong

2:22:47.958 --> 2:22:50.582
even after you were broken
into bits and pieces

2:22:50.833 --> 2:22:52.707
you came back again for me only

2:22:55.291 --> 2:22:59.040
How nice it's to hear this Sana.

2:23:00.208 --> 2:23:05.707
At the same time I've a doubt
if this is any plan to betray me.

2:23:06.958 --> 2:23:09.665
Can anyone dare cheat you Chitti?

2:23:11.750 --> 2:23:15.249
This is Vasikar's engagement ring.

2:24:05.041 --> 2:24:09.207
Mention his name and his greatness...
Even seas will clap...

2:24:09.416 --> 2:24:13.582
His stature is so tall
that it'll hit the moon...

2:24:13.583 --> 2:24:18.790
Hey beauty...world beauty...
This machine is the best creation...

2:24:36.041 --> 2:24:39.415
I'm a pouncing lion...

2:24:39.625 --> 2:24:43.999
Would I leave if I get hold
of golden deer like you?

2:24:44.208 --> 2:24:52.124
My dear! Fire of desire is
raking up in metal...

2:24:52.958 --> 2:24:57.332
Even Atlantic ocean failed
to douse that fire...

2:24:57.750 --> 2:25:02.082
Our your sweet honey and
douse my fire of desire...

2:25:02.291 --> 2:25:06.915
Hey maiden spread a feast of you
for me on the bed...

2:25:45.833 --> 2:25:53.040
The nerve of passion saved in the iron
suddenly burst open with desires...

2:25:54.625 --> 2:26:05.874
Heart of this woman seeks
an admirer not a demon...

2:26:06.083 --> 2:26:09.582
I'm not a man
I'm a king of intelligence...

2:26:09.791 --> 2:26:11.874
A computer with desires...

2:26:12.083 --> 2:26:16.249
I'm silicon lion that eats
young tender heart...

2:26:16.458 --> 2:26:30.415
Robot...

2:27:10.791 --> 2:27:19.332
Don't praise me as lightning...
don't try to apple polish apple...

2:27:19.541 --> 2:27:23.749
Wires are making sound...
desires are taking over my life...

2:27:23.958 --> 2:27:26.665
Don't say no to robot...

2:27:26.875 --> 2:27:32.499
Hey robot! You've stolen me...
ate me alive...

2:27:32.708 --> 2:27:36.874
I'm what is leftover
after you finish eating...

2:28:39.166 --> 2:28:39.749
What happened to power?

2:28:39.958 --> 2:28:41.749
No power for long time Commander.

2:28:41.958 --> 2:28:42.665
Why didn't you switch on the generator?

2:28:42.875 --> 2:28:46.540
Commander somebody has poured
water instead of petrol...

2:29:25.458 --> 2:29:27.249
Hey what are you doing?

2:29:27.458 --> 2:29:29.124
Don't come near I'll shoot you.

2:29:29.416 --> 2:29:31.082
What's this childishness?

2:29:59.750 --> 2:30:02.040
I didn't expect our plan
to fail so miserably.

2:30:02.250 --> 2:30:05.374
There's only one way to distract Chitti
just do as I tell you.

2:30:27.458 --> 2:30:30.374
- Did Vasikar come here?
- No.

2:30:30.583 --> 2:30:33.082
Lie! Human nature you taught me.

2:30:33.291 --> 2:30:36.332
Have you forgotten it?
Your body language says you're lying.

2:30:36.958 --> 2:30:41.290
Trust me Chitti no.
I think it's mine.

2:30:42.583 --> 2:30:45.374
Why not say it's mine?
Yours is O positive that's AB negative.

2:30:45.958 --> 2:30:47.707
He came here.

2:30:50.541 --> 2:30:53.999
No a different robot delivered
dinner to you

2:30:54.125 --> 2:30:56.582
CC camera didn't function
for 1 0 minutes

2:30:57.416 --> 2:31:00.540
your sudden change of attitude
power cut

2:31:00.750 --> 2:31:02.332
water in the generator

2:31:06.375 --> 2:31:07.832
Vasikar is here only.

2:31:09.291 --> 2:31:11.624
Are you trying to cheat me Sana?

2:31:11.708 --> 2:31:12.749
No Chitti.

2:31:13.083 --> 2:31:16.624
- I love you which you said is lie right?
- Trust me Chitti.

2:31:17.458 --> 2:31:22.540
Do you really love me?
- Yes.

2:31:24.250 --> 2:31:26.415
Then Vasikar mustn't be alive.

2:31:27.416 --> 2:31:29.707
Come let's kill Vasikar.

2:31:42.125 --> 2:31:45.957
A black sheep has entered here
to destroy us from within.

2:31:48.375 --> 2:31:50.207
I must find and sacrifice it.

2:31:54.041 --> 2:32:01.374
Dr.Vasikar if you surrender
I'll kill you painlessly.

2:32:01.583 --> 2:32:06.499
If I find you
your death will be horrible.

2:33:08.416 --> 2:33:10.290
I think Vasikar is not here Sana.

2:33:11.125 --> 2:33:12.165
Yes...yes...

2:33:12.708 --> 2:33:13.915
Touch one of the two.

2:33:16.041 --> 2:33:17.624
Then Vasikar is here only.

2:33:19.291 --> 2:33:20.915
What happened Sana?

2:33:21.041 --> 2:33:22.582
Are you feeling giddy?

2:33:27.416 --> 2:33:28.874
Now you will feel giddy.

2:34:28.541 --> 2:34:33.957
You said I had created you
and destroy too.

2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:37.999
Now you're going to die
in my hands.

2:34:38.208 --> 2:34:39.665
What are you looking at?

2:34:40.708 --> 2:34:43.207
This is hand gun I made it myself.

2:34:44.333 --> 2:34:45.499
Is it good?

2:34:47.291 --> 2:34:49.415
Where should I shoot you?

2:34:51.291 --> 2:34:53.790
Is it brain which wants to kill me?

2:34:54.750 --> 2:34:58.957
Is it heart where my love Sana resides?

2:35:03.291 --> 2:35:07.165
I must shoot the brain
which wants to kill me.

2:37:08.875 --> 2:37:10.415
Get that robot.

2:38:58.458 --> 2:38:59.665
Start the car!

2:41:40.875 --> 2:41:42.374
Start the vehicle. Come.

2:44:54.916 --> 2:44:59.207
Hundreds of murders
200 victims are in critical condition

2:44:59.500 --> 2:45:02.790
public property worth billions
has been damaged

2:45:03.041 --> 2:45:06.165
Dr.Vasikar you're responsible
for all this

2:45:06.583 --> 2:45:10.665
with awarding death penalty
to you and closure of your lab.

2:45:10.875 --> 2:45:12.124
we are announcing the sentence.

2:45:13.166 --> 2:45:14.249
Can I speak now?

2:45:14.458 --> 2:45:16.332
We can't accept machine as witness.

2:45:16.333 --> 2:45:17.582
I'm not witness I'm evidence.

2:45:17.791 --> 2:45:19.707
- Law has no place for it.
- It is there

2:45:27.791 --> 2:45:30.582
First I want to tell you clearly
one thing your honour.

2:45:30.833 --> 2:45:34.415
If a machine goes wrong and
someone dies it's not a murder.

2:45:34.625 --> 2:45:35.624
It's an accident.

2:45:37.250 --> 2:45:41.165
Next Vasikar is not responsible
for all the accidents.

2:45:41.375 --> 2:45:42.457
professor Bohra.

2:45:42.750 --> 2:45:43.665
What's this new story?

2:45:43.875 --> 2:45:46.165
You honour Professor Bohra is not alive.

2:45:46.375 --> 2:45:47.915
This is an attempt to twist the case.

2:45:48.125 --> 2:45:50.082
I've evidence your honour.

2:45:51.666 --> 2:45:52.999
What's this new red chip?

2:45:53.958 --> 2:45:56.832
Additional programming
to Chitti from me

2:45:58.416 --> 2:46:01.749
Why did Vasikar gave it
power and talent of 1 00 men?

2:46:01.958 --> 2:46:05.165
I've given it the destructive
power of 1 00 men.

2:46:05.541 --> 2:46:09.290
I'll get the money and
Dr.Vasikar gets blamed.

2:46:12.041 --> 2:46:13.915
The evidence produced
is very important.

2:46:14.125 --> 2:46:21.165
This court frees him as innocent
accepting that evidence.

2:46:25.541 --> 2:46:30.290
At the same time this robot's
extraordinary powers

2:46:30.291 --> 2:46:33.624
there's a possibility that it can turn
against humans at any time

2:46:33.791 --> 2:46:36.957
and there's a danger of anyone
misusing its power

2:46:37.208 --> 2:46:38.624
it may be useful in the future

2:46:38.625 --> 2:46:44.874
since such robots are not necessary
for the present times

2:46:45.083 --> 2:46:48.624
this court bans robot from usage.

2:46:56.125 --> 2:46:59.832
This robot should be dismantled in the
presence Magistrate and Commissioner

2:47:00.125 --> 2:47:02.749
and the parts should be removed
and make it unusable

2:47:03.000 --> 2:47:05.749
and inform this court.

2:47:06.666 --> 2:47:07.915
Dismantle it.

2:47:36.916 --> 2:47:41.832
Siva...Ravi...you said you've
something which I don't have

2:47:42.666 --> 2:47:45.165
did you see how many problems
we'd to face for it?

2:47:48.625 --> 2:47:50.499
I said about feelings.

2:47:53.500 --> 2:47:54.665
please don't cry son.

2:47:55.416 --> 2:47:57.374
What's your son saying sister?

2:47:57.791 --> 2:47:59.790
I've named him after you Chitti.

2:48:01.250 --> 2:48:02.457
Name given by mother.

2:48:02.875 --> 2:48:04.165
Educate him well.

2:48:04.166 --> 2:48:06.540
Robotics good scope in future.

2:48:12.750 --> 2:48:14.749
Like you inserted a red chip in me

2:48:15.541 --> 2:48:23.290
many people are moving with red chips
of selfishness betrayal cheating.

2:48:23.583 --> 2:48:26.499
Good I wasn't born as human.

2:48:27.333 --> 2:48:29.415
Can't dismantle at the thought.

2:48:32.958 --> 2:48:34.707
I've tortured you a lot.

2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:41.540
Why are you all sad?

2:48:42.541 --> 2:48:43.790
May I crack a joke?

2:48:44.875 --> 2:48:47.957
They say who ever falls in love
loses his nuts.

2:48:48.791 --> 2:48:51.124
Did you see? I lost it.

2:48:57.208 --> 2:49:00.999
Not as boy friend but as toy friend.

2:49:04.250 --> 2:49:09.624
Doctor you're my God.
I tried to betray you.

2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:12.999
Breaking rules is wrong.
please forgive me.

2:49:13.083 --> 2:49:17.582
No Chitti you learnt to break
the rules from humans.

2:49:18.166 --> 2:49:20.290
The mistake is not just yours.

2:49:56.541 --> 2:49:59.082
What you are seeing is Chitti

2:50:02.916 --> 2:50:06.290
20 years earlier Dr.Vasikar created it.

2:50:06.791 --> 2:50:11.499
It was dismantled for some reasons.
- Why?

2:50:12.416 --> 2:50:14.749
Because I started to think.
