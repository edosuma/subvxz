07:08.583 --> 07:09.959
Well I could ask him.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.417
-That's great idea.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.417
You ask Jung.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.417
-Okay.

07:12.458 --> 07:14.000
And if he say yes...

07:14.917 --> 07:17.458
Don't feel like you

07:14.917 --> 07:17.458
still have to sing too.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.875
School is so important.

07:18.917 --> 07:20.166
No, I want to do this.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.542
That's nice.

07:23.333 --> 07:26.083
But, uh, don't worry about

07:23.333 --> 07:26.083
hurting my feeling Janet.

07:23.333 --> 07:26.083
You can say no.

07:26.125 --> 07:27.250
Feel free to say no.

07:27.291 --> 07:29.250
-Say no, Janet.

07:27.291 --> 07:29.250
-This'll be good.

07:29.750 --> 07:30.875
I'm going to talk to Jung.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.583
I'm going to talk

07:30.917 --> 07:32.583
to Pastor Nina.

07:33.125 --> 07:34.583
I'm gonna make this happen.

07:34.834 --> 07:35.875
Yeah, okay.

Hey!

07:57.250 --> 07:58.875

08:12.750 --> 08:14.542
the singing festival?

08:12.750 --> 08:14.542
-Yeah.

08:15.125 --> 08:17.083
-What singing festival?

08:15.125 --> 08:17.083
-At church.

08:17.333 --> 08:20.625
-We're all singing.

08:17.333 --> 08:20.625
Me, Umma, and...

08:17.333 --> 08:20.625
-No way Jose.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.333
Why?

08:20.667 --> 08:23.333
You have a great voice, Appa.

08:23.375 --> 08:25.625
Yeah. Don't want to make

08:23.375 --> 08:25.625
rest of you look bad.

08:25.667 --> 08:28.375
All right. But I just thought

08:25.667 --> 08:28.375
it might be nice...

08:28.417 --> 08:30.166
Yeah. Take a picture of me

08:28.417 --> 08:30.166
with a truck.

08:30.625 --> 08:33.291
-Okay, but Appa...

-Ah, just take a picture.

08:33.875 --> 08:36.667
JANET: Are you just going

08:33.875 --> 08:36.667
to stand there?

08:36.709 --> 08:37.709
Yeah.

08:38.625 --> 08:39.709
(CAMERA CLICKING)

08:39.750 --> 08:41.458
Yup, that's the one.

08:45.583 --> 08:46.583
I already told her no.

08:46.625 --> 08:48.166
If you want

08:46.625 --> 08:48.166
to sing with her...

08:48.208 --> 08:50.333
She really, really wants

08:48.208 --> 08:50.333
you to be there.

08:50.375 --> 08:52.291
I know.

08:50.375 --> 08:52.291
She made it

08:50.375 --> 08:52.291
really, really clear.

08:52.333 --> 08:54.083
But, it's not happening.

08:54.125 --> 08:55.250
Okay.

08:55.291 --> 08:56.500
Here's the deal.

08:56.542 --> 08:58.917
I need Umma to be

08:56.542 --> 08:58.917
in a good mood, 'cause...

08:59.750 --> 09:00.917
I'm moving out.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.625
I'm getting an apartment

09:01.750 --> 09:03.625
with Gerald and Semira.

09:03.667 --> 09:05.000
That's great!

09:05.041 --> 09:06.542
What does that have

09:05.041 --> 09:06.542
to do with me singing?

09:08.375 --> 09:10.542
I just think telling Umma

09:08.375 --> 09:10.542
after a big family thing

09:08.375 --> 09:10.542
will make it easier.

09:11.750 --> 09:13.542
-You know that's

09:11.750 --> 09:13.542
stupid, right?

09:11.750 --> 09:13.542
-I do.

09:13.583 --> 09:15.375
But I really think

09:13.583 --> 09:15.375
telling Umma

09:15.417 --> 09:17.583
-after we do

09:15.417 --> 09:17.583
a big family thing...

09:15.417 --> 09:17.583
-I'll do it.

09:17.875 --> 09:19.792
-This is my serious face.

Oh!

09:22.625 --> 09:24.667
Wait.

09:22.625 --> 09:24.667
Appa's not doing this, is he?

09:24.709 --> 09:26.000
No way Jose.

09:26.041 --> 09:27.291
How's he liking the ride?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.500
-(SCOFFS) That's hilarious.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.500
-Hey, family meeting!

09:33.542 --> 09:35.500
Sorry I'm late.

09:33.542 --> 09:35.500
What I miss?

09:35.542 --> 09:37.417
We're singing at

09:35.542 --> 09:37.417
the church family festival.

09:38.083 --> 09:39.583
-It's back on?

09:38.083 --> 09:39.583
-Apparently.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.542
-I'll spread the word.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.542
-Kimchee, don't.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.291
Oops. Group text.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.583
-How much are tickets?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.583
-There's no tickets.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.583
It's a church thing.

09:47.625 --> 09:49.834
Don't tell Terence that.

09:47.625 --> 09:49.834
I'm gonna sell him a ticket.

09:50.208 --> 09:51.250
You owe me.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.500
What are those, Mr. Kim?

09:52.500 --> 09:54.500
Twenty-one inch rims?

09:54.834 --> 09:56.792
Yeah. Maybe longer.

09:56.834 --> 09:59.583
Well, whatever they are,

09:56.834 --> 09:59.583

10:01.709 --> 10:04.417

You know what would make

10:16.792 --> 10:19.625
you look even better...

10:21.083 --> 10:22.542
No.

10:22.583 --> 10:24.500

10:34.000 --> 10:35.709

10:38.625 --> 10:41.583

11:07.792 --> 11:09.375
winning, is it?

11:09.417 --> 11:10.667
No, no.

11:10.709 --> 11:13.041
It's just for fun

11:10.709 --> 11:13.041
