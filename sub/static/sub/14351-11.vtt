WEBVTT

00:04.910 --> 00:08.575
Ship's log, stardate 5710.5.

00:08.748 --> 00:11.073
Lieutenant Commander Scott
reporting.

00:11.250 --> 00:13.576
While exploring
an outer quadrant of the galaxy,

00:13.753 --> 00:15.876
the Enterprise received
distress calls

00:16.047 --> 00:18.917
from an apparently uninhabited,
incredibly beautiful city

00:19.091 --> 00:20.882
on the planet of Scalos.

00:21.051 --> 00:24.385
Captain Kirk and a landing party
have beamed down to investigate.

00:24.555 --> 00:25.586
Kirk to Enterprise.

00:25.765 --> 00:28.090
- What do your sensors read?
- They register something, sir,

00:28.267 --> 00:30.593
but I'm blessed
if I can figure out what it is.

00:30.770 --> 00:33.178
- Specify.
- I can't get a fix on it.

00:33.356 --> 00:35.265
Sensors don't pinpoint a location.

00:35.442 --> 00:38.858
We may have a malfunction.
I'm about to check circuits, sir.

00:39.029 --> 00:40.523
You do that.

00:40.697 --> 00:43.271
Lieutenant Uhura,
does the location of the distress call

00:43.450 --> 00:46.120
correspond with this area exactly?

00:46.287 --> 00:48.992
Yes, sir.
I am still receiving visual contact.

00:49.165 --> 00:51.407
I can see them, but I can't see you.

00:51.584 --> 00:55.202
Check coordinates.
Is it the same area?

00:55.380 --> 00:57.123
Coordinates correspond, captain.

00:57.298 --> 01:00.050
Well, apart from the landing party,
there's no one here.

01:00.218 --> 01:02.258
There are no Scalosians.

01:02.429 --> 01:05.050
The distress call
is very strong, captain.

01:05.223 --> 01:07.300
They are pleading
for immediate assistance.

01:07.476 --> 01:10.762
Check circuits for malfunctions.
Kirk out.

01:12.523 --> 01:15.060
It must be a malfunction.
This is a barren world.

01:15.233 --> 01:17.985
There's hardly any vegetation,
no apparent animal life.

01:18.153 --> 01:21.107
When we run analysis,
we should have some explanation.

01:21.490 --> 01:23.732
But there is an insect life.

01:24.159 --> 01:28.572
- My tricorder doesn't register it.
- Registers in my ears.

01:32.001 --> 01:35.287
- Nothing, Mr. Spock?
- Evidently a civilisation of high order.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.539
Rating number 7
on the industrial scale,

01:37.715 --> 01:40.171
humanoid in appearance,
according to the paintings.

01:40.343 --> 01:45.005
An abundance of literature, which
I shall have translated and processed.

01:45.349 --> 01:48.469
Certain structures hold evidence
of recent occupancy,

01:48.644 --> 01:51.217
while others
are apparently long abandoned.

01:51.397 --> 01:53.271
No sign of present life?

01:53.441 --> 01:55.682
Instrument readings
indicate life forms,

01:55.860 --> 01:58.944
but of a highly unusual
and intermittent nature.

01:59.113 --> 02:02.150
They have no discernible form
or location.

02:02.325 --> 02:05.990
A most puzzling phenomenon, captain,
I shall have to study it further.

02:06.162 --> 02:08.154
Something was here.
We saw them on the screen.

02:08.330 --> 02:10.619
Lieutenant Uhura
is still getting a distress call.

02:10.791 --> 02:13.958
- What happened?
- Unknown at present, captain.

02:14.128 --> 02:16.501
Mr. Spock,
I want you to run a survey.

02:16.673 --> 02:19.876
A complete survey of the planet
using all ship's available instruments.

02:20.051 --> 02:21.629
Compton!

02:23.638 --> 02:24.919
What happened?

02:25.098 --> 02:26.890
I was looking at him.

02:27.059 --> 02:31.223
I was looking right at him,
then he just wasn't there.

02:41.866 --> 02:45.401
Space, the final frontier.

02:50.792 --> 02:54.921
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

02:55.089 --> 02:59.087
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

02:59.260 --> 03:03.091
to seek out new life
and new civilisations,

03:03.263 --> 03:06.846
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

03:50.105 --> 03:52.181
Lieutenant Uhura,
start a replay of the distress call.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.026
Scotty, are the transporter controls
functioning now?

03:55.193 --> 03:56.736
Aye, sir.
Is Mr. Spock still down there?

03:56.903 --> 04:01.031
No, he's in Sickbay. Dr. McCoy's
running a check on the landing party.

04:01.532 --> 04:04.450
- What is it, lieutenant?
- Malfunction, sir.

04:04.953 --> 04:08.452
- Mr. Sulu, I would like...
- Captain, it corrected itself.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.996
Captain, there's some trouble
on the hangar deck.

04:11.168 --> 04:12.330
The controls are frozen.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.127
Have repair crews been assigned?

04:14.296 --> 04:17.000
- Yes, sir.
- The tape is ready, sir.

04:17.675 --> 04:19.132
Play it.

04:20.636 --> 04:22.261
To any and all space travellers

04:22.430 --> 04:25.431
passing within range
of the planet Scalos,

04:25.600 --> 04:28.387
I send you
an urgent appeal for help.

04:29.062 --> 04:32.016
My comrades and I are
the last surviving members

04:32.190 --> 04:35.357
of what was once
a thriving civilisation.

04:36.028 --> 04:38.601
Those of us who are left
have taken shelter in this area.

04:39.490 --> 04:42.859
We have no explanation
for what has been happening to us.

04:43.035 --> 04:44.529
Our number is now five.

04:45.371 --> 04:47.862
We were once a nation of 900,000.

04:48.040 --> 04:49.369
Freeze it.

04:49.834 --> 04:52.669
This city alone...

04:52.837 --> 04:56.040
It is logical to assume that
this distress call was prerecorded.

04:56.215 --> 04:59.465
What we received was evidently
a delayed taped message.

04:59.635 --> 05:02.091
That would explain
our continuing to receive it

05:02.263 --> 05:04.836
while our sensors picked up
only the landing party, sir.

05:05.016 --> 05:07.009
Yes, but the fact remains
that when we beamed down,

05:07.185 --> 05:10.352
we couldn't find those people.
They were there, now they're not.

05:10.522 --> 05:12.016
Nor is crewman Compton.

05:12.857 --> 05:14.815
It would seem
that some force or agent,

05:14.985 --> 05:17.393
only partially discernible
to our instruments,

05:17.571 --> 05:18.851
may have been responsible.

05:21.825 --> 05:24.281
Mr. Sulu,
I want the ship on standby alert

05:24.453 --> 05:26.197
while we continue the investigation.

05:26.372 --> 05:29.041
Sir, now I have readings
that deflectors are inoperative.

05:29.208 --> 05:30.751
The controls are frozen.

05:31.669 --> 05:33.876
Scotty, assist.

05:37.717 --> 05:39.710
Mr. Spock, ever since
we beamed up from Scalos,

05:39.886 --> 05:41.262
we've had a series of malfunctions.

05:41.430 --> 05:44.597
I want an investigation
and an explanation.

05:46.685 --> 05:50.136
McCoy to Captain Kirk. Captain's
presence for examination is requested.

05:50.313 --> 05:54.097
- Can't it wait, Bones?
- Your orders, Jim. You're the last one.

05:54.276 --> 05:57.312
- What do you read so far?
- Can we discuss it here?

05:57.487 --> 06:01.153
On my way.
Mr. Spock, you have the conn.

06:04.328 --> 06:06.570
- What is it?
- Tell the captain what you told me.

06:06.747 --> 06:07.945
Something's going on, captain.

06:08.124 --> 06:11.041
Somebody's opened
all the medical-supply cabinets.

06:11.210 --> 06:13.287
- Anything missing?
- Just disordered.

06:13.463 --> 06:15.752
As though someone had picked up
everything and examined it.

06:15.924 --> 06:17.418
Thank you.

06:17.676 --> 06:19.384
Lie down, Jim.

06:19.553 --> 06:22.507
Well, that fits in
with other disturbances.

06:29.772 --> 06:33.355
Bones, what did your readings
show up on the other men?

06:33.526 --> 06:35.020
All perfectly normal.

06:35.194 --> 06:36.689
Whatever happened
to Compton down there

06:36.863 --> 06:39.568
apparently had no effect
on anyone else.

06:39.991 --> 06:43.988
Any of them report any unusual
experience since beaming up?

06:44.161 --> 06:46.487
No, there's no mention of it.

06:53.171 --> 06:55.709
- I'm not finished yet.
- Hold on.

07:04.600 --> 07:10.519
Bones, could something
be making me hallucinate?

07:10.731 --> 07:12.523
What do you mean?

07:13.818 --> 07:17.187
I mean that twice before,
something touched me

07:17.363 --> 07:19.439
and there was nothing there.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.859
And it's just happened again.

07:23.036 --> 07:26.037
Could I be imagining it?

07:26.498 --> 07:29.535
Well, physically,
there's nothing wrong with you.

07:29.793 --> 07:32.082
But am I hallucinating?

07:33.339 --> 07:35.082
I'd say no.

07:38.510 --> 07:41.083
Then we did
beam something aboard.

07:42.556 --> 07:44.798
Something has invaded the ship.

07:46.894 --> 07:48.933
Kirk to Spock, come in.

07:49.271 --> 07:50.303
Spock, come in.

07:50.481 --> 07:52.889
Captain, I have a reading
from Life Support Centre.

07:53.067 --> 07:54.395
Spock, I can't hear you.

07:54.569 --> 07:56.442
Check your circuits,
is there a malfunction?

07:56.612 --> 08:00.064
Captain, intercom system
is breaking down rapidly.

08:00.241 --> 08:02.364
Lieutenant, shipwide order.

08:02.535 --> 08:04.160
Use communicators
instead of intercom.

08:04.329 --> 08:06.571
Issue phasers to all crew members.

08:06.748 --> 08:07.780
Spock, repeat.

08:07.958 --> 08:09.915
I have a reading from
Life Support Centre.

08:10.085 --> 08:14.213
- Alien substances being introduced.
- Meet me there on the double.

08:24.934 --> 08:26.892
- Spock?
- It is a force field, captain,

08:27.062 --> 08:30.098
the nature of which
I am not familiar with.

08:30.273 --> 08:32.562
I'm getting readings
of an alien presence

08:32.734 --> 08:34.726
similar to those obtained
on the planet's surface,

08:34.902 --> 08:36.860
but they seem to have
no exact location.

08:37.030 --> 08:40.399
Phasers on stun. Sweep the area.

08:54.506 --> 08:56.748
It would seem, captain,
that they intend to allow

08:56.926 --> 08:59.417
only the two of us to enter.

08:59.595 --> 09:02.133
I should advise caution.

09:19.825 --> 09:21.367
What is it?

09:24.789 --> 09:29.497
Unknown, captain, but it is evidently
a device of alien origin.

09:29.668 --> 09:33.333
Hooked into the life support.
Designed to affect it.

09:33.505 --> 09:35.831
Life support is still operating.

09:36.008 --> 09:38.333
I would say that
the installation is incomplete.

09:40.137 --> 09:41.846
Disconnect it.

09:44.601 --> 09:46.261
Destroy it.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.850
That was no force field.
Something shoved me back.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.108
They're in here.

09:56.280 --> 09:57.822
You.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.692
What are you doing on my ship?

10:00.951 --> 10:02.944
Show yourselves.

10:13.715 --> 10:19.801
It seems that we may look at it,
captain, but that is all.

10:20.389 --> 10:21.551
- A show of strength.
- Yes.

10:21.723 --> 10:25.388
Evidently, they are convinced
that we can do nothing to stop them,

10:25.560 --> 10:29.890
and they wish to impress upon us
what they can do to us.

10:30.357 --> 10:31.899
Have your readings
been fed into the computer?

10:32.067 --> 10:34.309
- Affirmative
- Read out.

10:34.486 --> 10:38.816
Computer, analyse and reply.
Have we been invaded?

10:38.991 --> 10:40.022
Affirmative.

10:40.201 --> 10:42.442
Nature and description
of enemy forces.

10:42.620 --> 10:45.870
- Data insufficient.
- Number of enemy forces.

10:46.040 --> 10:49.409
- Data insufficient.
- Purpose of the invasion.

10:49.586 --> 10:50.700
Immediate purpose:

10:50.879 --> 10:55.956
Seizure and control of Federation
starship Enterprise and crew.

10:56.134 --> 11:00.179
Data insufficient
for determination of end purpose.

11:00.347 --> 11:04.641
Is there a connection between this
and Compton's disappearance?

11:04.810 --> 11:06.803
Data insufficient.

11:06.979 --> 11:10.099
Are we, at present,
capable of resisting?

11:10.274 --> 11:13.275
- Negative.
- Your recommendations?

11:13.444 --> 11:18.320
If incapable of resistance,
negotiate for terms.

11:18.741 --> 11:21.066
- We will not negotiate. You concur?
- Aye.

11:21.243 --> 11:25.324
- Mr. Spock?
- Your recommendations, captain?

11:26.457 --> 11:27.488
Yeoman.

11:27.667 --> 11:32.246
Is that coffee available, or have those
circuits been damaged as well?

11:33.131 --> 11:37.924
My recommendation?
Make them take the next step.

13:07.773 --> 13:09.314
Spock?

13:12.276 --> 13:13.391
Captain.

13:25.624 --> 13:28.032
Would you mind explaining..?

13:32.047 --> 13:33.423
Who are you?

13:33.591 --> 13:36.675
Deela. The enemy.

13:43.518 --> 13:45.890
- You're the enemy?
- Yes.

13:46.062 --> 13:48.933
You beamed me aboard yourself
when you came up.

13:49.107 --> 13:52.393
A ridiculously long process,
but I've taken care of it.

13:52.569 --> 13:54.645
- What have you done with my men?
- Nothing.

13:54.822 --> 13:55.984
Nothing?

13:57.575 --> 13:58.855
Mr. Spock?

14:03.206 --> 14:04.403
Scotty.

14:06.041 --> 14:07.286
This is nothing?

14:07.459 --> 14:09.701
There's really
nothing wrong with them.

14:09.878 --> 14:12.548
They are just
as they have always been.

14:13.048 --> 14:15.456
It's you who are different.

14:15.801 --> 14:17.509
Lieutenant.

14:18.596 --> 14:20.174
Sulu.

14:20.890 --> 14:22.171
This is nothing?

14:22.350 --> 14:26.644
They cannot hear you, captain.
To their ears, you sound like an insect.

14:26.813 --> 14:31.772
That's your description, captain.
Accurate, if unflattering.

14:32.277 --> 14:35.611
Really, there is
nothing wrong with them.

14:35.781 --> 14:39.364
- What have you done?
- Changed you.

14:39.744 --> 14:41.736
You are like me now.

14:41.913 --> 14:45.282
Your crew cannot see you,
or any of us,

14:45.458 --> 14:48.080
because of the acceleration.

14:48.378 --> 14:51.664
We move in the wink of an eye.

14:51.840 --> 14:54.924
Oh, there is a scientific
explanation for it,

14:55.719 --> 14:59.846
but all that really matters
is that you can see me

15:00.014 --> 15:02.137
and talk to me,

15:02.475 --> 15:07.137
and we can go on from there.

15:08.774 --> 15:10.316
Why?

15:10.484 --> 15:14.434
Because I like you.
Didn't you guess?

15:14.863 --> 15:19.241
Or are you so accustomed
to being kissed by invisible women?

15:26.292 --> 15:28.000
Deela.

15:33.425 --> 15:36.094
Is this why you sabotaged my ship?

15:36.261 --> 15:39.796
Oh, it has not been sabotaged, we...

15:40.140 --> 15:43.011
We had to make some changes in it
to adjust it to us.

15:43.185 --> 15:46.103
- You said "we."
- Yes, of course.

15:46.272 --> 15:49.356
My chief scientist and his crew.

15:49.734 --> 15:52.307
I am their queen.

15:52.821 --> 15:55.690
You are going to be their king.

15:56.365 --> 15:59.319
You'll enjoy living on Scalos.

16:00.536 --> 16:03.288
What about my ship? My crew?

16:03.456 --> 16:07.703
Oh, in a few of their moments,
they will realise that you've vanished.

16:07.877 --> 16:11.709
They will look for you,
but they will not find you.

16:12.048 --> 16:14.884
You're accelerated
far beyond their power to see.

16:15.552 --> 16:17.212
So they'll go on without you.

16:17.638 --> 16:21.849
Don't be so stubborn.
You cannot go back to them, ever.

16:24.770 --> 16:27.974
Is it so dreadful a prospect?

16:30.360 --> 16:33.895
This won't kill you, but the
stun effect is not very pleasant.

16:35.031 --> 16:36.063
Oh, that won't work.

16:38.285 --> 16:40.076
Well, you go ahead. Try.

16:42.581 --> 16:43.992
Point it right at me.

16:49.671 --> 16:53.254
My reactions are much too fast
for such a crude weapon.

16:53.717 --> 16:56.718
And I am quite good
at self-defence too.

16:59.348 --> 17:02.266
This can be set for
stun and destroy too, like yours.

17:06.771 --> 17:10.142
Please, accept what has happened.

17:10.318 --> 17:12.523
There is nothing
you can do to change it.

17:23.749 --> 17:28.244
If I agree to go with you,
will you set this ship to rights,

17:28.420 --> 17:31.291
take out that device
in the life-support system?

17:31.465 --> 17:32.628
Don't be so silly.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.967
You'll feel better about it all
in a little while.

17:36.137 --> 17:38.344
It always happens this way.

17:38.515 --> 17:41.053
They are very upset at first,

17:41.226 --> 17:46.812
then it wears off,
then they learn to like it.

17:47.189 --> 17:49.313
You will too.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.448
He's on his way to you.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.954
Be gentle with him.

18:03.123 --> 18:05.579
Captain? Captain Kirk!

18:05.751 --> 18:07.744
He's gone.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.879
Lieutenant, did you see
what happened?

18:10.047 --> 18:13.001
He was sitting there, he'd just drunk
his coffee and he set the cup down.

18:13.176 --> 18:16.794
You see, it's still there.
And then he vanished.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.807
- Mr. Sulu, do you verify?
- That's just the way it happened.

18:19.974 --> 18:23.344
He was there,
then all of a sudden he wasn't there.

18:28.692 --> 18:30.484
- Captain Kirk, you've made it.
- Compton.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.195
- Did they accelerate you?
- Yes, sir.

18:32.363 --> 18:34.854
They've hooked something
into the life-support system.

18:35.032 --> 18:37.239
They're in there.
We've gotta get rid of it.

18:37.410 --> 18:39.366
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry, sir, entry's forbidden.

18:39.536 --> 18:40.817
- By whose order?
- The commander.

18:40.996 --> 18:44.282
- You'll have to step back, please.
- I am your commander, Compton.

18:44.458 --> 18:45.869
And I order you to let me in.

18:46.043 --> 18:49.626
- I'm sorry, sir, you are no longer.
- Who is? Deela?

18:49.797 --> 18:51.920
Is that who you're working for?

18:54.010 --> 18:57.924
At first I refused, but then after a while
I found that I couldn't help myself.

18:58.097 --> 19:00.221
I met this girl.

19:00.558 --> 19:03.097
She's one of them.
I've never known anyone like her.

19:03.270 --> 19:05.891
She brought me aboard and I showed
them the operation of the ship.

19:06.481 --> 19:08.355
Bridge controls, life support.

19:08.901 --> 19:11.392
She explained
that they wanted to know.

19:11.570 --> 19:15.070
I didn't understand at first,
but I do now.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.150
So will you, sir.

19:18.327 --> 19:20.071
All right, Compton.

19:24.959 --> 19:26.122
Stun.

19:39.098 --> 19:42.183
You were ordered to stop him.
Why did you disobey?

19:42.352 --> 19:43.763
I tried to stop him.

19:46.481 --> 19:47.762
You hurt him.

19:47.941 --> 19:49.768
He was violent, had to be subdued.

19:50.194 --> 19:53.029
He was my captain.

19:54.448 --> 19:56.441
Cell damage.

19:58.035 --> 20:00.953
Another will be secured for you.

20:04.959 --> 20:08.079
I'm getting a trace reading
similar to that on the planet.

20:08.255 --> 20:11.375
- Mr. Sulu, did you drink your coffee?
- Yes.

20:11.550 --> 20:14.385
- Did anyone else?
- I had some.

20:14.553 --> 20:16.047
May I?

20:16.472 --> 20:18.464
Was it the coffee?

20:19.183 --> 20:20.926
Are we gonna go too,
just like the captain?

20:21.102 --> 20:24.637
I cannot give you that answer
until these have been analysed.

20:24.814 --> 20:26.308
Well, by that time, it'll be too late.

20:26.482 --> 20:28.060
I suggest we recall
the captain's words:

20:28.234 --> 20:32.694
"Make them take the next step."
It would seem they have taken it.

20:32.863 --> 20:36.446
And we must determine
effective countermeasures.

20:36.617 --> 20:40.567
Mr. Scott, you have the conn.
I shall be in the medical lab.

20:45.460 --> 20:48.212
I hate what happens to them
when they're damaged.

20:48.380 --> 20:50.835
You're going to have to learn
to control your temper, Rael.

20:51.508 --> 20:53.667
I do not want that
to happen to this one.

20:55.220 --> 20:59.468
If they are so stubborn a species,
perhaps they will last longer.

21:01.435 --> 21:05.184
- It may be.
- I hope so.

21:05.523 --> 21:07.432
They all go so soon.

21:07.609 --> 21:10.942
I want to keep this one a long time.
He's pretty.

21:13.031 --> 21:18.192
- He is inferior, Deela.
- I don't think so.

21:18.370 --> 21:21.371
You cannot allow yourself
to feel an attachment to such.

21:21.540 --> 21:24.873
I can allow myself anything I want.

21:25.710 --> 21:30.953
Oh, Rael, don't be like that.
Am I jealous of what you do?

21:31.133 --> 21:34.003
- I do my duty.
- So do I.

21:34.178 --> 21:37.713
And sometimes
I allow myself to enjoy it.

21:39.767 --> 21:41.345
Hello.

21:48.234 --> 21:50.642
What is that device
doing on my ship?

21:52.030 --> 21:54.153
Deela will explain it.

21:57.869 --> 22:00.076
I will tell you anything
you want to know,

22:00.247 --> 22:01.528
and you'll approve of it.

22:01.790 --> 22:04.994
Approve of it? We're your prisoners.

22:05.169 --> 22:08.419
Hardly. You're free
to go anywhere you want to.

22:17.515 --> 22:19.341
Go ahead, captain.

22:19.767 --> 22:21.925
It is not yet completely linked
to your support system,

22:22.103 --> 22:24.475
but it is in operating order.

22:24.730 --> 22:29.974
Study it if you wish.
I suggest that you do not touch it.

22:51.259 --> 22:52.634
He told you not to touch it.

22:52.802 --> 22:55.922
Look at your hands.
They're almost frozen, aren't they?

22:56.639 --> 22:57.885
It will pass.

22:58.058 --> 23:01.972
The unit has its own
self-defence mechanism, as you see.

23:02.145 --> 23:03.390
You should have heeded me.

23:10.488 --> 23:14.071
In your struggle with Compton,
some of his cells were damaged.

23:22.124 --> 23:26.074
Those newly accelerated to our level
are sensitive to cell damage.

23:26.253 --> 23:28.163
They age very rapidly and die.

23:37.474 --> 23:40.510
- He was so young.
- Was.

23:40.685 --> 23:45.478
- This is what you have planned for us?
- We all die. Even on Scalos.

23:48.861 --> 23:51.399
Why did you lie to him?

23:51.572 --> 23:54.028
He did not damage that one,
you did.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.694
Perhaps he will be less violent now.

23:55.868 --> 23:58.241
I see no reason to make him feel
any worse than he has to.

23:58.413 --> 23:59.658
Why do you care what he feels?

24:00.373 --> 24:03.825
Rael, he's not one of us.
He's temporary.

24:04.628 --> 24:07.035
Why, he's gone to
the medical laboratory.

24:07.214 --> 24:10.167
He's trying to communicate
with the Vulcan.

24:10.883 --> 24:14.134
The species is capable
of much affection.

24:14.304 --> 24:16.047
I have noted that.

24:16.681 --> 24:19.967
I wonder if they will
demonstrate it to us.

24:21.353 --> 24:23.180
Oh, Rael, stop sulking.

24:24.898 --> 24:26.606
Accept it.

24:26.775 --> 24:29.693
We've had to accept it all our lives.

24:29.862 --> 24:32.020
Don't make it worse.

24:40.039 --> 24:42.246
Go back to work.

24:49.174 --> 24:51.083
Kirk to Spock.

24:51.593 --> 24:58.131
I have fed all the ascertainable facts
into the computer banks...

25:02.981 --> 25:05.934
Go ahead.
You won't accomplish anything,

25:06.108 --> 25:08.065
but it may be historically valuable.

25:10.654 --> 25:13.276
Hyperacceleration is the key.

25:13.449 --> 25:15.276
I have counted only
five of them aboard,

25:15.451 --> 25:16.910
but they have taken over the ship,

25:17.203 --> 25:21.153
and we are under their control
due to this acceleration.

25:21.958 --> 25:26.288
They are able to speed others
up to their level,

25:26.463 --> 25:28.456
as they did Compton and me.

25:28.799 --> 25:32.084
Presumably, this is enslavement.

25:33.637 --> 25:37.053
Those so treated

25:37.224 --> 25:41.139
exist at this accelerated level,

25:41.312 --> 25:46.473
becoming docile, eventually.

25:48.028 --> 25:50.353
But when...

25:50.947 --> 25:52.110
Damaged.

25:52.699 --> 25:58.204
- Damaged, they age incredibly fast.

25:58.372 --> 26:01.158
As though accelerated living...

26:01.332 --> 26:02.364
Burns them out.

26:02.751 --> 26:05.076
- Burns them out.

26:05.629 --> 26:07.918
Compton was burned out.

26:09.341 --> 26:12.924
The device attached
to the life-support systems

26:13.095 --> 26:16.511
produces an extreme, numbing cold.

26:16.682 --> 26:20.134
It is my belief
that they are turning the Enterprise

26:20.311 --> 26:23.514
into a gigantic deep freeze...

26:26.067 --> 26:29.816
...for purposes
only the Scalosians know.

26:30.071 --> 26:31.530
Quite correct.

26:32.407 --> 26:38.861
The unit has a protective shield which
does not allow any physical contact.

26:39.206 --> 26:45.375
I don't know how to destroy it,
but its destruction is imperative.

26:45.546 --> 26:48.251
The unit will be activated.

26:48.466 --> 26:51.503
By the time they hear this,
it will be too late.

27:04.565 --> 27:06.642
You have remarkable
reasoning powers, captain.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.353
You were quite right
in almost every assumption.

27:09.529 --> 27:13.064
- Why are you doing this?
- Do you really wanna know?

27:13.241 --> 27:15.115
In a little while,
it won't matter to you at all.

27:15.285 --> 27:18.156
You'll be quite happy about it.
Just as Compton was.

27:18.330 --> 27:20.738
- I really wanna know.
- Oh, dear.

27:20.916 --> 27:22.909
You are so stubborn.

27:23.085 --> 27:26.704
It should be obvious to you that
we're doing it because we have to.

27:26.881 --> 27:33.418
A long time ago... It is in our history.
- We used to be like you.

27:33.638 --> 27:37.850
And our country was almost
destroyed by volcanic eruptions.

27:38.018 --> 27:41.767
The water was polluted,
radiation was released.

27:41.939 --> 27:45.059
That changed us. It accelerated us.

27:46.193 --> 27:47.771
Children died.

27:47.945 --> 27:50.815
Most of the women found
they could not have any more.

27:50.989 --> 27:53.445
All of our men had become sterile.

27:53.617 --> 27:55.942
So we had to mate
outside our own people.

27:57.329 --> 28:00.449
Whenever a spaceship came by,
we sent out calls for help.

28:00.624 --> 28:03.376
But accelerating them to our level
burned them out.

28:03.669 --> 28:07.916
Don't you see, captain?
Do I have to go into every detail?

28:10.093 --> 28:12.798
We are going to take you
down with us.

28:12.971 --> 28:14.880
Perhaps one or two others
of your crew.

28:15.432 --> 28:17.092
We have to.

28:17.267 --> 28:19.224
Oh, we'll be kind to you.

28:19.394 --> 28:22.099
I wouldn't hurt you, certainly.
I do like you.

28:24.817 --> 28:26.276
What about the rest of my crew?

28:26.443 --> 28:28.436
They will remain here
in suspended animation.

28:29.155 --> 28:31.562
Oh, it will do them no harm.

28:31.741 --> 28:35.240
We are saving them
for when we need them in the future.

28:36.079 --> 28:39.744
You will not last forever.
You know that, captain.

28:40.458 --> 28:42.617
Captain, we have
the right to survive.

28:42.878 --> 28:44.076
Not by killing others.

28:44.254 --> 28:46.923
You would do
exactly the same thing.

28:47.089 --> 28:49.462
You came charging down
into that life-support room

28:49.634 --> 28:51.093
the minute you knew
there was trouble.

28:51.261 --> 28:53.170
You would have killed my people
if you could have.

28:53.346 --> 28:54.888
You invaded my ship,
threatened my crew.

28:55.056 --> 28:57.263
- There is no difference.
- There is a difference!

28:57.434 --> 29:01.479
Your trouble is in you.

29:01.647 --> 29:04.316
We did not ask for it.
We are not to blame.

29:04.483 --> 29:07.021
We are handling it
in the only way we know how.

29:07.194 --> 29:10.030
The way our parents did
and their parents before them.

29:10.197 --> 29:15.192
Did they solve anything?
Have you tried any other way?

29:15.370 --> 29:19.581
Deela, have your scientists
disconnect, destroy that unit.

29:19.749 --> 29:23.534
I promise you, we'll use
every skill we have to help you.

29:23.712 --> 29:26.001
We'll move you to another planet,
if that's what you want.

29:26.173 --> 29:29.708
We'll call in the most brilliant minds
in our Federation to help.

29:29.885 --> 29:32.555
- We'll do...
- We have tried other ways.

29:32.805 --> 29:36.055
We have tried to make the transition
to your level.

29:36.392 --> 29:41.349
Some of us, that is.
Those who made the attempt died.

29:42.147 --> 29:46.726
We are trapped, captain,
just as you are trapped now.

29:48.070 --> 29:51.938
I'm sorry for what's going to happen
to you, but I cannot change it.

29:52.241 --> 29:54.649
You cannot change me.

29:57.121 --> 29:59.410
Go to the Transporter Room, Deela.

29:59.582 --> 30:01.374
Signal me when you're there
and beam down.

30:01.543 --> 30:03.417
With the captain?

30:04.671 --> 30:05.702
Yes.

30:05.881 --> 30:08.550
I'll activate our unit and follow you.

30:08.717 --> 30:12.003
I'm setting it to allow enough time
for all of us to get off the ship.

30:12.179 --> 30:14.421
Please don't delay.

30:14.598 --> 30:17.268
What makes you think
I would do that?

30:18.060 --> 30:20.516
- The captain's gone.
- Go after him, Deela.

30:23.274 --> 30:27.107
There's no question about it, Spock.
I want you to take a look at this.

30:27.279 --> 30:29.604
The same substance
that's in the captain's coffee

30:29.781 --> 30:30.979
is in the Scalosian water,

30:31.158 --> 30:33.945
and there's no trace of it
in any of the other cups.

30:44.963 --> 30:46.707
- Why did you run?
- I panicked.

30:46.882 --> 30:48.341
I don't believe that.

30:48.509 --> 30:51.794
I'd like to leave before he activates
the suspended-animation device.

30:51.971 --> 30:54.129
We're in the Transporter Room,
you can activate.

30:54.306 --> 30:56.430
Beam him down at once.

31:02.649 --> 31:04.309
Captain.

31:22.003 --> 31:23.995
What have you done
to the transporter, captain?

31:24.172 --> 31:26.627
It was working before. Try it again.

31:31.929 --> 31:35.013
- The transporter isn't working.
- What did he do to it?

31:35.182 --> 31:37.341
Nothing. He didn't have time.

31:37.518 --> 31:41.516
It must be a... What do you call it?
A malfunction.

31:42.315 --> 31:45.020
You'd better not activate the unit yet.

31:48.029 --> 31:50.865
What would you say it is, captain?

31:51.199 --> 31:54.616
The technicians reported
a loss of power. That must be it.

31:55.120 --> 31:57.528
- The captain says his technicians...
- I heard him.

31:57.706 --> 31:59.699
You expect me to believe him?

32:00.418 --> 32:03.668
I expect you to check into
all possible causes.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.925
If I had a suspicious nature, captain,

32:09.094 --> 32:12.926
I would say that you sabotaged
the transporter to buy time.

32:13.098 --> 32:14.889
Yes, of course.

32:15.934 --> 32:20.810
I'm glad we're both innocents.
I despise devious people, don't you?

32:20.981 --> 32:24.232
Oh, I believe in
honest relationships myself.

32:25.402 --> 32:26.647
Nurse, programme the information

32:26.820 --> 32:30.154
and determine whether
we can find counteragents.

32:32.576 --> 32:35.067
Doctor, did you just hear..?

32:35.245 --> 32:39.575
I've been hearing that whine ever
since we beamed down to Scalos.

32:42.086 --> 32:46.416
I know what it is.
We brought it with us from Scalos.

32:46.591 --> 32:50.042
If you'll excuse me, doctor,
I shall be on the Bridge.

32:50.220 --> 32:53.221
Your quarters
are quite like you, captain.

32:53.390 --> 32:59.263
Austere and efficient,
and in their own way, handsome.

32:59.813 --> 33:02.565
A room should reflect its occupant.

33:02.733 --> 33:04.690
Absolutely.

33:05.736 --> 33:06.981
May I freshen up?

33:07.154 --> 33:10.440
All this rushing about
has left me windblown.

33:10.742 --> 33:14.075
I'm glad to see that you allow
yourself some comforts.

33:14.704 --> 33:17.076
Are you married, captain?

33:17.499 --> 33:20.949
No family? No attachments?

33:21.377 --> 33:26.798
I know. You're married to your career,
and you never look at another woman.

33:26.966 --> 33:31.463
Well, if she's pretty enough, I'll look.

33:31.638 --> 33:33.631
I wondered when
you'd say something nice to me.

33:36.977 --> 33:38.602
Am I more presentable now?

33:42.149 --> 33:43.394
A bit.

33:45.236 --> 33:49.981
It was quite delightful kissing you
when you couldn't see me.

33:50.658 --> 33:55.285
- But now...
- But now...

34:07.551 --> 34:10.469
No. I wouldn't allow you to take that.

34:10.638 --> 34:13.306
No matter how much
we trust each other.

34:15.225 --> 34:17.929
But I would have been disappointed
if you hadn't tried.

34:19.521 --> 34:22.190
Was I too crude?

34:22.608 --> 34:25.692
Just don't try it again.

34:25.860 --> 34:28.435
You're far too vulnerable
to skin damage.

34:28.614 --> 34:32.030
All I have to do is scratch you.

34:32.201 --> 34:33.993
Yes, I know.

34:35.038 --> 34:37.031
The difference between us is that

34:37.206 --> 34:41.121
you will come around
to our way of thinking sooner or later.

34:41.545 --> 34:45.411
But it's better sooner than later.

34:55.893 --> 34:58.811
Lieutenant, will you replay the
Scalosian distress call on my viewer?

34:58.980 --> 35:00.854
Aye, sir.

35:01.816 --> 35:03.311
To any and all space travellers

35:03.485 --> 35:05.727
passing within range
of the planet Scalos,

35:06.738 --> 35:09.574
I send you
an urgent appeal for help.

35:10.158 --> 35:13.075
My comrades and I are
the last surviving members

35:13.244 --> 35:15.700
of what was once
a thriving civilisation.

35:20.627 --> 35:22.419
- Compton!
- What happened?

35:23.130 --> 35:24.921
I was looking at him.

35:25.090 --> 35:29.088
I was looking right at him,
then he just wasn't there.

35:32.181 --> 35:35.467
Those of us who are left
have taken shelter in this area.

35:35.643 --> 35:39.178
We have no explanation
for what has been happening to us.

35:48.407 --> 35:49.866
Those of us left have taken shelter.

35:50.033 --> 35:52.026
We have no explanation
for what has been happening.

35:52.202 --> 35:54.444
Our number is now five.
We were once a nation of 900,000,

35:54.622 --> 35:57.492
this city alone holding a total
population of 113,477 citizens.

35:57.667 --> 36:00.502
Our planet, Scalos, in which existed
culturally enlightened populations,

36:00.670 --> 36:03.624
has attempted to survive this
mysterious affliction, but to no avail...

36:16.477 --> 36:18.600
There is an insect life.

36:18.980 --> 36:20.724
My tricorder doesn't register it.

36:20.899 --> 36:22.975
- My ears, registers in.
- This is a barren world.

36:23.151 --> 36:25.821
Limited vegetation,
no apparent animal life.

36:46.718 --> 36:49.007
- McCoy to Spock.
- Spock here.

36:49.179 --> 36:51.337
I found a tape
in the computer down here.

36:51.515 --> 36:53.721
And when I try to read it,
all I get is a whine.

36:53.892 --> 36:56.680
Bring it to the Bridge
at once, doctor.

36:59.064 --> 37:02.515
This device attached
to the life-support systems

37:02.984 --> 37:06.768
produces an extreme,
numbing cold.

37:06.947 --> 37:10.482
It is my belief that
they are turning the Enterprise

37:10.659 --> 37:14.028
into a gigantic deep freeze.

37:14.205 --> 37:20.824
The unit has a protective shield which
does not allow any physical contact.

37:21.045 --> 37:27.214
I don't know how to destroy it,
but its destruction is imperative.

37:27.385 --> 37:30.137
The unit will be activated.

37:30.347 --> 37:34.392
By the time they hear this,
it will be too late.

37:34.560 --> 37:36.683
Lieutenant Uhura,
notify the rest of the crew.

37:36.854 --> 37:38.229
- Aye, sir.
- Can we use phasers

37:38.397 --> 37:41.564
to cut through that wall, bypass
the force field and get at that unit?

37:41.734 --> 37:44.688
Mr. Scott, we cannot
cope with them on our level.

37:44.862 --> 37:46.855
Can we find some way
of coping with them on theirs?

37:47.031 --> 37:49.190
That is a very logical suggestion.

37:49.367 --> 37:51.075
Please stand by
in the Transporter Room.

38:00.628 --> 38:02.835
There's nothing wrong
elsewhere, sir.

38:03.006 --> 38:05.212
Sufficient energy for beaming down.

38:05.383 --> 38:07.423
This is the only damage?

38:08.929 --> 38:11.336
Well, go get the others
and bring them up here.

38:17.354 --> 38:19.098
Deela?

38:21.984 --> 38:23.443
Deela.

38:27.532 --> 38:29.275
Deela?

38:56.103 --> 38:57.728
Rael!

39:11.786 --> 39:13.281
Rael...

39:21.088 --> 39:22.119
No.

39:33.893 --> 39:35.637
Now, stop it.

39:37.605 --> 39:40.144
- Did he damage you, captain?
- No.

39:40.984 --> 39:43.143
How very fortunate for you, Rael.

39:44.488 --> 39:46.480
Don't you dare
do anything like that again.

39:47.991 --> 39:49.271
It's contemptible.

39:49.450 --> 39:52.487
Then don't torment me.
You know how I feel.

39:52.871 --> 39:56.655
I don't care what your feelings are.
I don't want to know that aspect of it.

39:56.833 --> 39:59.503
What I do is necessary,
and you have no right to question it.

40:02.131 --> 40:04.836
Allow me the dignity
of liking the man I select.

40:11.808 --> 40:13.516
Is the transporter repaired?

40:13.935 --> 40:17.849
No. I have more work to do.

40:18.231 --> 40:20.722
Don't you think you'd better do it?

40:47.636 --> 40:52.180
He loves me.
I adored him when I was a child.

40:52.350 --> 40:54.592
I suppose I still do.

40:54.936 --> 40:57.427
I must say,
you behaved better than he did.

40:57.605 --> 41:00.393
- Yes, I hope so.
- What did you say?

41:00.567 --> 41:04.102
I said I hoped I behaved correctly.

41:05.531 --> 41:09.149
And nothing bothers you now?

41:13.164 --> 41:14.741
Why are we here?

41:14.916 --> 41:18.581
Our leaving was delayed.
Don't you remember?

41:18.753 --> 41:24.626
- You damaged the transport.
- Oh, yes. That was wrong of me.

41:25.302 --> 41:27.840
Yes, it certainly was.

41:28.388 --> 41:30.677
But we are going to Scalos?

41:31.433 --> 41:33.390
- Do you want to?
- Oh, yes.

41:33.560 --> 41:35.552
What about your crew?
Aren't you worried about them?

41:35.728 --> 41:37.602
They'll be all right.

41:39.107 --> 41:40.732
What's the matter?

41:41.777 --> 41:43.485
Nothing.

41:44.571 --> 41:47.775
You've completely accepted
the situation, haven't you?

41:47.950 --> 41:49.693
You even like it.

41:49.868 --> 41:53.368
- Am I behaving incorrectly?
- No.

41:54.081 --> 41:55.492
I liked you better before.

41:55.666 --> 41:57.955
Stubborn and irritating
and independent.

41:58.127 --> 42:02.125
- Like Rael.
- Those are undesirable qualities.

42:02.799 --> 42:07.508
Maybe that's why I liked you so much.
Because you were like him.

42:09.264 --> 42:13.808
Rael, you don't have to
worry about the captain.

42:14.311 --> 42:16.767
He's made the adjustment.

42:18.524 --> 42:20.149
Finished.

42:30.036 --> 42:32.953
Yes. It counteracts the substance
most effectively.

42:33.122 --> 42:35.447
Most effectively
under laboratory conditions.

42:35.625 --> 42:37.867
But the question is,
will it work in the human body?

42:38.044 --> 42:41.495
And the second question is,
how do we get it to the captain?

42:41.714 --> 42:43.173
By drinking the Scalosian water.

42:43.341 --> 42:46.342
But, Spock, you don't know
what that'll do to you.

42:48.138 --> 42:51.472
It is somewhat stimulating.

42:54.812 --> 42:58.644
You seem to be moving
very slowly, doctor.

43:06.533 --> 43:08.442
Fascinating.

43:14.041 --> 43:15.832
He's gone.

43:18.128 --> 43:20.370
Just like Compton.

43:34.728 --> 43:37.101
I've beamed the others down.

43:37.731 --> 43:39.060
Is it repaired already?

43:39.817 --> 43:41.146
Why didn't you tell me?

43:42.236 --> 43:44.525
It would have been an intrusion.

43:44.906 --> 43:47.575
Come up when you wish.
Signal me when you are ready.

43:48.076 --> 43:50.365
- Where will you be?
- In Life Support.

43:50.537 --> 43:51.817
I have to activate our unit.

43:51.997 --> 43:53.372
Rael, wait.

43:53.790 --> 43:54.988
I'm sorry.

43:56.877 --> 43:58.620
I know.

44:04.760 --> 44:08.011
Well, come, captain.
It's time to leave your pretty ship.

44:14.980 --> 44:19.357
The unit is activated, Deela.
Beam down at once.

44:19.526 --> 44:22.692
You crew will be all right.
You said so yourself.

44:28.118 --> 44:29.612
I'm sorry.

44:30.704 --> 44:34.784
- He's broken away. He's armed.
- I'm ready for him.

45:15.251 --> 45:19.165
You are very clever, captain.
You tricked me.

45:19.338 --> 45:21.331
I should have known
that you would never adjust.

45:24.176 --> 45:26.134
What shall we expect
from you now?

45:26.304 --> 45:28.427
We could put you
in suspended animation,

45:28.598 --> 45:30.258
until we determine
what to do with you.

45:31.768 --> 45:33.844
Your survival
does not depend on that.

45:34.354 --> 45:36.181
No, it doesn't.

45:36.857 --> 45:38.683
What do you want us
to do with you?

45:38.859 --> 45:42.358
Don't make a game of it, captain.
We've lost.

45:42.529 --> 45:43.692
If I sent you back to Scalos,

45:43.864 --> 45:47.944
you'd undoubtedly play the same trick
on the next spaceship that passed by.

45:48.119 --> 45:50.870
There won't be any others.
You'll warn them.

45:51.038 --> 45:53.494
Your Federation
will quarantine the entire area.

45:54.250 --> 45:55.875
Yes, I suppose it would.

45:56.044 --> 45:58.879
And we will die
and solve your problem that way.

45:59.714 --> 46:01.707
And ours.

46:07.806 --> 46:09.965
Now, what about
your problem, captain?

46:10.142 --> 46:11.386
And your Vulcan friend?

46:12.227 --> 46:16.059
If you will devote yourself exclusively
to the concerns of Scalos, madam,

46:16.231 --> 46:19.232
we shall be pleased to remain
and take care of the Enterprise.

46:20.027 --> 46:23.859
You could still find
life on Scalos very pleasant.

46:24.448 --> 46:25.479
And very brief.

46:25.908 --> 46:27.616
It'll be just as brief here.

46:27.785 --> 46:29.327
You cannot get back
to your own level.

46:36.544 --> 46:38.751
No answer, captain?

46:39.923 --> 46:41.714
Do I displease you so much?

46:42.551 --> 46:44.211
Oh, no.

46:44.594 --> 46:50.763
I can think of nothing
I'd rather do than stay with you.

46:50.934 --> 46:52.761
Except staying alive.

47:03.615 --> 47:04.694
Energize.

47:05.824 --> 47:07.901
Goodbye, captain.

47:18.755 --> 47:20.130
Well, Mr. Spock,
what have you got?

47:20.715 --> 47:23.966
Dr. McCoy and I have synthesized
a possible counteragent

47:24.136 --> 47:25.594
to the Scalosian water.

47:25.762 --> 47:29.463
Regrettably, we did not have
the opportunity to test it.

47:30.100 --> 47:32.591
Let's test it.

47:45.200 --> 47:46.575
Nothing's happening.

47:53.333 --> 47:56.003
You do seem to be moving
very slowly, captain.

47:56.170 --> 48:01.080
Mister...

48:05.262 --> 48:06.293
...Spock?

48:07.139 --> 48:08.170
Captain Kirk!

48:08.348 --> 48:09.843
Where in the blazes
did you come from?

48:10.017 --> 48:14.181
- Out of the nowhere, into the here.
- And Mr. Spock, is he coming too?

48:14.355 --> 48:15.897
Scotty.

48:17.149 --> 48:19.688
Captain's log, stardate 5710.9.

48:19.861 --> 48:22.566
Mr. Spock has remained
in accelerated time

48:22.739 --> 48:25.277
so that he might effect repairs
to the ship more rapidly.

48:25.450 --> 48:27.324
Somebody's repairing
every console on the ship.

48:27.494 --> 48:30.495
This panel is being re-circuited
at an incredible speed.

48:30.664 --> 48:34.876
I think we've located Mr. Spock.

48:35.044 --> 48:38.210
- Lieutenant, are your circuits clearing?
- Yes, sir.

48:38.672 --> 48:40.416
- Cancel red alert, Mr. Sulu.
- Aye, sir.

48:40.591 --> 48:41.706
Open all channels.

48:44.512 --> 48:45.543
Captain to crew.

48:45.722 --> 48:48.047
Repairs are now being effected
by Mr. Spock.

48:48.224 --> 48:53.219
The ship will resume
normal operations almost immediately.

48:54.564 --> 48:55.808
Mr. Spock.

48:55.982 --> 48:58.555
My compliments
to your repair work and yourself.

48:58.734 --> 49:03.646
Thank you, captain.
I found it an accelerating experience.

49:03.823 --> 49:05.448
Yes.

49:06.785 --> 49:08.908
No malfunctions anywhere?

49:12.958 --> 49:13.989
Lieutenant.

49:15.836 --> 49:18.623
I'm sorry, sir,
I touched the tape button accidentally.

49:18.797 --> 49:19.877
I'll take it off.

49:20.424 --> 49:23.378
That's no malfunction?

49:24.470 --> 49:26.262
No, sir.

49:37.818 --> 49:40.274
Goodbye, Deela.
