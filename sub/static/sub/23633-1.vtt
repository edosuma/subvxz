05:24.157 --> 05:27.743
Welcome, Colonel Lee.
Welcome to my home.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.955
Make yourself comfortable
there, colonel.

05:38.797 --> 05:41.298
Allow me to get to the point, sir.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.719
I have been authorized by
President Lincoln himself...

05:44.886 --> 05:47.888
...with the full blessing
of the War Department...

05:48.056 --> 05:52.810
...to offer you full command of the Army
with the rank of major general.

05:52.978 --> 05:59.191
This Army being raised to quell this
rebellion and to preserve the Union.

06:01.653 --> 06:05.698
I assume this Army is to be used
to invade those areas...

06:05.866 --> 06:08.576
...to eliminate the rebellion by force.

06:08.744 --> 06:13.289
Yes, sir, the Federal government
has been challenged by these rebels...

06:13.457 --> 06:18.461
...who have been most effective in changing
the sentiments of state legislatures...

06:19.004 --> 06:23.966
... challenging our Constitution and
challenging our central government.

06:24.134 --> 06:29.013
The attack on Fort Sumter
cannot be ignored.

06:29.181 --> 06:32.892
General, my home is right there
across the Potomac.

06:33.060 --> 06:36.479
Why, you can see Arlington House
from your front door.

06:36.938 --> 06:40.649
My family is spread all
over this part of Virginia.

06:40.817 --> 06:45.821
If you invade the South, your enemy
territory will be right across that river.

06:46.323 --> 06:52.536
Well, sir, there is no great outcry
for secession in Virginia.

06:52.704 --> 06:57.792
It's not a foregone conclusion that
Virginia or Tennessee or Arkansas...

06:57.959 --> 07:01.253
... or Kentucky will join the rebellion.

07:02.172 --> 07:05.841
My friend, may I humbly submit that
you're mistaken about Virginia.

07:06.009 --> 07:09.678
As you know, the legislature is
convening in Richmond this very day...

07:09.846 --> 07:12.890
...to discuss the very
issue of secession.

07:13.058 --> 07:16.352
Now, perhaps you know their mind
better than they themselves.

07:19.397 --> 07:25.653
And I regret to say the president's
hasty calling up of 75, 000 volunteers...

07:25.821 --> 07:29.031
...to subdue the rebellion
in the cotton states...

07:29.199 --> 07:34.036
... has done nothing to ameliorate
the crisis. It has only deepened it.

07:35.997 --> 07:40.376
I trust you're not being
too hasty yourself, colonel.

07:40.544 --> 07:46.632
This is a great opportunity
for you to serve your country.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.555
My country, Mr. Blair?

07:54.391 --> 07:58.018
I never thought I'd see the day
the president of the United States...

07:58.186 --> 08:02.022
...would raise an army
to invade his own country.

08:05.318 --> 08:11.740
No, Mr. Blair, I cannot lead it.
I will not lead it. No.

08:14.578 --> 08:17.580
I'm sorry to hear you say that, sir.

08:17.747 --> 08:21.625
I fear you're making
a most dreadful mistake.

08:30.677 --> 08:35.806
Sir, please convey my deep sense of
honor and gratitude to the president...

08:35.974 --> 08:38.475
... but I must decline his offer.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.519
Please tell him.

08:41.313 --> 08:45.983
Please be clear. I have
never taken my duties lightly...

08:46.151 --> 08:52.364
... but I have no greater duty
than to my home, to Virginia.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.083
Thank you, sir.

09:23.063 --> 09:27.942
Gentlemen, if you are going
to succeed at this institution ...

09:28.109 --> 09:31.820
...you have one common goal:
To learn your lessons.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.448
If you are placing
your energies elsewhere...

09:36.910 --> 09:41.455
...you will not succeed either with me
or in your careers as military officers.

09:41.623 --> 09:45.668
I had hoped you'd see that with a
proper grasp of the artillery principles...

09:45.835 --> 09:48.837
... I've laid before you today,
you would learn to apply...

09:49.005 --> 09:52.758
...these principles with great
effectiveness in your field experiences.

09:52.926 --> 09:57.930
But since you seem unable
to grasp these principles...

09:58.098 --> 10:03.435
... I'm forced to conclude I must repeat
this lesson tomorrow, word for word.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.357
Word for word.

10:35.885 --> 10:41.640
Major, listen to them.
The leaders of our intellectual future...

10:41.808 --> 10:44.393
... screaming for the destruction
of our nation!

10:44.561 --> 10:48.439
Sir, President Lincoln is raising
the troops.

10:52.902 --> 10:59.074
I will not stay in a place where my
students dishonor their country's flag.

11:01.286 --> 11:06.415
Major, I'm leaving
for Pennsylvania tomorrow.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.002
War is the sum of all evils.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.589
But if I know myself,
all I am and all I have...

11:13.757 --> 11:17.426
... is at the service of my
home, my country.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.887
Your country, Thomas?

11:20.055 --> 11:24.350
Your country, my country. It's all one.

11:25.352 --> 11:29.897
All one, Thomas. All one.

11:38.615 --> 11:43.285
So that in the midst of the searching
of souls and the gnashing of teeth ...

11:44.621 --> 11:47.206
...the delegates of this convention ...

11:47.374 --> 11:53.128
... harried by the actions of a belligerent
usurper and the radicals of his party...

11:53.296 --> 11:55.798
... have stumbled into secession.

11:55.965 --> 12:00.886
Now God knows, I and many
in this room have resisted it.

12:01.054 --> 12:06.683
But how could there be union
with a section of the country...

12:06.851 --> 12:11.480
...that wants to impose
its will through coercion?

12:11.648 --> 12:17.569
Now that Virginia confronts the armed
might of the United States...

12:17.737 --> 12:23.659
...we Virginians have determined
that not one spot of her sacred soil ...

12:23.827 --> 12:27.579
... be polluted by the foot of an invader.

12:40.009 --> 12:44.430
Now, in the memory of that great
Virginian, George Washington ...

12:44.597 --> 12:48.809
...who was first in the hearts
of his countrymen and calling also...

12:48.977 --> 12:54.940
... upon the memory of his own gallant
father, General Light-Horse Harry Lee...

12:55.191 --> 13:01.029
...this convention now calls upon
Robert Edward Lee to take command ...

13:01.197 --> 13:06.660
... of the armed forces of
the Citizen Army of Virginia.

13:35.398 --> 13:39.234
Mr. President, gentlemen
of the convention ...

13:39.402 --> 13:43.572
... I'm profoundly impressed by the
solemnity of the occasion ...

13:43.740 --> 13:47.034
...for which I must say
I was not prepared.

13:47.744 --> 13:52.039
I accept the position assigned me
by your partiality.

13:52.999 --> 13:58.045
I would have much preferred had
your choice fallen on an abler man.

13:59.088 --> 14:04.259
But trusting to Almighty God,
an approving conscience...

14:04.427 --> 14:07.221
... and the aid of my fellow citizens...

14:07.889 --> 14:12.100
... I devote myself to the service
of my native state...

14:13.102 --> 14:19.525
... in whose behalf alone will I
ever again draw my sword.

15:53.161 --> 15:59.458
We must not fear the final result of this
war, but many a loved one will fall ...

16:00.043 --> 16:02.753
... and many a heart throb
with anguish ...

16:02.920 --> 16:07.257
... before we can breathe the exhilarating
atmosphere of freedom ...

16:07.425 --> 16:12.929
... and feel the sweet assurance
of safety and peace once more.

16:13.765 --> 16:18.060
There's nothing in this life more dear
to me than my children ...

16:18.269 --> 16:21.772
... except perhaps the memory
of your wonderful father.

16:25.234 --> 16:29.905
When you go to Richmond,
and wherever this war takes you ...

16:30.239 --> 16:36.745
...you must not fear for us.
We will be with you wherever you go.

16:37.789 --> 16:43.210
Surely goodness and mercy have
followed me all the days of my life.

16:50.426 --> 16:56.264
Now be on your way,
and God be with you.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.272
Y'all be coming on back, you hear?

17:06.858 --> 17:08.819
We'll be back, Martha.

17:12.615 --> 17:15.117
I won't forget to write you, sister.

17:15.576 --> 17:19.871
I know there are a thousand brothers
leaving a thousand homes...

17:20.039 --> 17:22.958
... and I know we're not
the only ones, Mother.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.628
But I've never felt sadder in my life.

17:38.641 --> 17:42.394
Good morning, major.
This just arrived for you.

18:02.331 --> 18:06.501
Cadet Norris, return to the institute.
My compliments to Colonel Smith.

18:06.669 --> 18:09.421
I will be at his office
within the half-hour.

18:09.589 --> 18:10.881
Sir.

18:13.926 --> 18:18.180
"You are ordered to report with the
corps of cadets to camp instruction ...

18:18.347 --> 18:21.433
...to begin training and organization
of the Provisional Army...

18:21.601 --> 18:24.519
...for the defense of the
Commonwealth of Virginia."

18:26.397 --> 18:28.440
My esposita.

18:30.359 --> 18:33.195
Come, before I leave, we must sit...

18:33.362 --> 18:36.865
... read together, the verse.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.578
Here.

18:43.206 --> 18:48.627
Yes, here. Corinthians--
Second Corinthians, chapter five.

18:49.337 --> 18:52.464
I have been thinking about this verse.

18:53.758 --> 18:59.805
"For we know that if our earthly house
of this Tabernacle were dissolved ...

18:59.972 --> 19:02.682
...we have a building of God.

19:02.850 --> 19:08.146
A house not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens."

19:15.446 --> 19:17.531
O, Almighty God ...

19:18.574 --> 19:22.077
... grant that if it be thy will ...

19:22.245 --> 19:26.456
...thou wilt still avert the threatening
danger and bring us peace.

19:29.502 --> 19:32.754
Keep her whom I love in
thy protected care.

19:34.549 --> 19:39.052
And bring us all at last to
the joy of thy eternal kingdom.

21:04.180 --> 21:09.517
"The Lord is my life. My salvation.
Whom shall I fear?

21:10.061 --> 21:15.982
The Lord is the strength in my life.
Of whom shall I be afraid?

21:16.150 --> 21:19.736
When the wicked, even mine
enemies and my foes...

21:19.904 --> 21:25.659
...came upon me to eat up my flesh,
they stumbled and fell.

21:25.868 --> 21:32.374
Though unhost should encamp against
me, my heart shall not fear.

21:32.750 --> 21:36.711
The wall should rise up against me.

21:36.879 --> 21:40.256
In this will I be comforted ."

22:40.443 --> 22:46.781
Secession is inexcusable. Southerners
and Northerners can still work together.

22:47.700 --> 22:52.120
Slavery will eventually die
of natural causes.

22:52.288 --> 22:55.749
But the breakup of the Union
will inaugurate wars...

22:55.916 --> 22:59.002
... of a hundred generations in America...

22:59.170 --> 23:04.257
... only to repeat the bloody
history of Europe.

23:06.302 --> 23:10.138
As a Christian man,
my first allegiance is to God.

23:10.973 --> 23:14.184
Then to my state, the state of Virginia.

23:14.643 --> 23:17.979
Every state has a primal claim
to the fealty of her citizens...

23:18.147 --> 23:20.648
... and they justly control
their allegiance.

23:20.816 --> 23:24.527
If Virginia adheres
to the United States, I adhere.

23:24.695 --> 23:31.034
Her determination must control mine.
This is my understanding of patriotism.

23:31.202 --> 23:36.039
And though I love the Union,
I love Virginia more.

23:39.460 --> 23:44.756
Private Jenkins, because of the high
regard with which I hold your father...

23:44.924 --> 23:50.136
...you are free to do as you please. You may
return to his new home in Pennsylvania.

23:50.304 --> 23:56.392
It is your decision.
But, if you decide to stay with us...

23:57.353 --> 24:02.857
...you may never again leave. If you do,
you'll be treated as a deserter.

24:14.829 --> 24:18.915
Colonel Jackson, sir. Father.

24:21.335 --> 24:24.379
I am a soldier in the 4th Virginia.

24:25.589 --> 24:28.716
And in the 4th Virginia I will stay.

24:30.386 --> 24:32.554
And if needs be, die.

24:39.395 --> 24:43.731
- Then I will take my leave.
- No, sir.

24:45.693 --> 24:49.904
It is I who will leave the two of you to
have some time together on your own.

24:50.072 --> 24:52.740
You may have this room
for as long as you require it.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.492
Thank you.

24:57.121 --> 24:59.164
Farewell, colonel.

25:02.251 --> 25:06.963
May we meet again in happier times.

25:07.631 --> 25:12.594
And if not in this troubled world
may we meet in ...

25:14.889 --> 25:16.139
In heaven.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.611
Order!

25:33.657 --> 25:38.203
- Parade, rest!
- Parade.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.747
Men of the valley.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.629
Citizen soldiers.

25:49.298 --> 25:54.052
I am here at the order of General Robert
E. Lee, commanding all Virginia forces.

25:55.930 --> 25:59.432
On April 1 5 of this year
of our Lord, 1 86 1 ...

25:59.600 --> 26:03.436
... Simon Cameron, the secretary of war
of the United States...

26:03.604 --> 26:08.274
... sent a telegram to our governor to
raise three regiments of infantry...

26:08.442 --> 26:12.153
...to be sent to assist in suppressing
the Southern Confederacy.

26:12.321 --> 26:17.116
Governor Letcher's answer is well
known to you, but perhaps not his words.

26:17.618 --> 26:20.161
His wire to Washington stated:

26:21.205 --> 26:24.666
"You have chosen to inaugurate civil war.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.628
Having done so, we will meet you
in a spirit as determined ...

26:28.796 --> 26:32.840
... as the Lincoln administration
has exhibited toward the South ."

26:33.842 --> 26:38.972
Two days later the Virginia legislature
were voting for secession.

26:40.808 --> 26:45.728
Just as we would not send any of our
soldiers to march in other states...

26:45.896 --> 26:48.189
... and tyrannize other people...

26:49.066 --> 26:53.569
... so will we never allow the armies
of others to march into our states...

26:53.737 --> 26:55.863
... and tyrannize our people.

26:56.407 --> 27:02.578
Like many of you, indeed most of you,
I've always been a Union man.

27:03.080 --> 27:07.750
It is not with joy or with a light heart
that many have welcomed secession.

27:08.335 --> 27:12.547
Had our neighbors to the North practiced
a less bellicose form of persuasion ...

27:12.715 --> 27:18.303
...this day might not have come.
But that day has been thrust upon us...

27:19.179 --> 27:22.515
... like it was thrust upon our ancestors.

27:23.392 --> 27:28.271
The Lincoln administration required
us to raise three regiments.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.525
Tell them we have done so.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.488
Dismissed.

27:40.784 --> 27:43.870
Attention, company!

27:51.295 --> 27:53.588
- Good morning, sir.
- Reverend Pendleton.

27:53.756 --> 27:57.842
- How goes it with the artillery today?
- You're just in time for a christening.

27:58.010 --> 28:03.598
The men have decided to name the
howitzers: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.

28:03.932 --> 28:09.062
I'm sure your men will spread the gospel
wherever they encounter the enemy.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.439
Has my son proven a worthy adjutant?

28:11.940 --> 28:16.611
I'm certain Captain Pendleton will prove
himself deserving of the family name.

28:22.993 --> 28:28.039
Thrust! Develop! Die!

28:30.793 --> 28:32.377
Captain White.

28:32.586 --> 28:34.796
How fare the scholars
of Washington College?

28:34.963 --> 28:37.757
Are they making their transition
from books to bullets?

28:37.925 --> 28:42.303
A few more days of drill, and my boys
will surpass the cadets of VMI.

28:42.471 --> 28:46.474
Drill, Professor White, drill and drill.
Remember Alexander in Anatolia.

28:46.642 --> 28:50.144
Caesar in Gaul. Napoleon in Iberia.

28:50.312 --> 28:54.023
We march by day,
and read Xenophon by night.

28:54.191 --> 28:58.653
- We will be your Greek phalanx.
- Then you must begin with the bayonet.

28:58.821 --> 29:02.782
The bayonet must be for a Virginian
what the sarissa was for a Macedonian.

29:02.950 --> 29:07.120
If the Yankees dare set foot in Virginia,
we must show them the bayonet.

29:07.287 --> 29:10.581
Train with the bayonet
and we shall keep our freedom.

29:10.791 --> 29:12.333
Yes, sir.

29:16.964 --> 29:22.844
Blue, gray, green, even red uniforms.
How are we to know who the enemy is?

29:23.011 --> 29:27.765
You dang fool, you just shoot
at the man that's shooting at you!

29:29.601 --> 29:31.894
I thought we was gonna be trained.

29:32.062 --> 29:35.022
I could have done this walking
on my own back in Staunton.

29:35.190 --> 29:40.486
I never seen you walk in your life when
you didn't have to. Nor me, neither.

29:40.654 --> 29:43.197
What man in his senses
would cross his street...

29:43.365 --> 29:46.409
...when he could just be
sitting on his front porch?

29:46.577 --> 29:52.248
I done more walking this week than in
my life and my daddy's life put together.

29:52.541 --> 29:57.086
Who'll give us fresh shoes when these
are but tatters and old bits of laces?

30:03.218 --> 30:05.386
You'll excuse me, gentlemen.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.689
Lieutenant Colonel Stuart
reporting for duty.

30:16.857 --> 30:18.399
Colonel Stuart.

30:19.026 --> 30:22.570
- That's an impeccable hat, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

30:23.405 --> 30:29.243
- Colonel Stuart. You use tobacco?
- No, sir. Not in any form.

30:29.411 --> 30:33.623
Neither do I. I find I like it too much.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.541
Sit down.

30:37.211 --> 30:40.880
I understand from your record that
you are West Point, class of '54.

30:41.048 --> 30:43.257
Served since in the cavalry,
Ft. Clark, Texas.

30:43.675 --> 30:48.971
Operations against Apache,
Comanche. You are a native Virginian.

30:49.139 --> 30:51.432
Fought with Longstreet and Ewell, sir.

30:52.184 --> 30:55.770
Nasty business. Merciless climate.

30:57.022 --> 30:58.356
Glad to be home, sir.

30:59.608 --> 31:03.402
The Apache were defending their
homes, as we will be defending ours.

31:03.737 --> 31:08.366
If we fight as well as the Apache,
I pity the Yankee invader.

31:08.534 --> 31:13.955
Colonel Stuart, if I had my way we
would show no quarter to the enemy.

31:14.122 --> 31:18.626
No more than the redskins showed your
troopers. The black flag, sir.

31:18.961 --> 31:23.047
If the North triumphs, it is not alone
the destruction of our property.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.633
It is the prelude to anarchy, infidelity...

31:25.801 --> 31:28.594
...the loss of free
and responsible government.

31:28.762 --> 31:32.640
It is the triumph of commerce.
The banks, factories.

31:32.808 --> 31:35.851
We should meet the invader on
the verge of just defense...

31:36.019 --> 31:41.023
... and raise the black flag. No quarter to
the violators of our homes and firesides.

31:43.026 --> 31:47.280
Our political leadership is too timid to
face the reality of this coming war.

31:47.447 --> 31:51.659
They should look to the Bible.
It is full of such wars.

31:51.827 --> 31:56.581
Only the black flag will bring the North
to its senses and rapidly end the war.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.625
Well, colonel.

32:00.586 --> 32:05.756
One way or the other, the South
will give them a warm reception.

32:05.924 --> 32:09.510
You'll be in charge of the cavalry
in the Harper's Ferry district.

32:09.678 --> 32:14.140
Your experience and your zeal
will be invaluable.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.475
Thank you, sir.

32:21.231 --> 32:22.690
And, colonel ...

32:23.358 --> 32:28.362
... know that I will tell my men always
to gallop toward the enemy...

32:28.530 --> 32:30.364
... but trot away.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.037
"Trot."

32:42.711 --> 32:46.547
The ratification vote for secession is in.

32:46.715 --> 32:52.720
Reporting from all the counties of
Virginia, the vote is 4-to- 1 in favor.

32:56.516 --> 33:00.728
And I'm proud to report that the vote
in the Shenandoah Valley...

33:00.896 --> 33:06.275
... is 3 1 30 in favor, 1 0 against!

33:07.527 --> 33:12.865
In my own Rockbridge County, only one
person voted against leaving the Union.

33:13.033 --> 33:15.493
It must have been the village idiot!

33:49.152 --> 33:53.114
Soldiers! Commanding
General Johnston's orders:

33:54.116 --> 33:57.326
"General Beauregard is being attacked
at Manassas Junction ...

33:57.494 --> 33:59.286
... by overwhelming forces."

33:59.913 --> 34:03.374
We have been ordered to cross
the Blue Ridge to his assistance.

34:03.625 --> 34:05.584
Every moment now is precious...

34:05.752 --> 34:10.589
... and the general hopes his soldiers
will step out and keep closed ranks.

34:10.757 --> 34:16.303
Well, this march is a forced march
to save our country.

34:55.552 --> 34:59.263
You must get some rest, sir.

34:59.514 --> 35:04.560
I'll rest easier when Pendleton and
the artillery make it up this mountain.

35:07.522 --> 35:12.193
They'll make better time tomorrow, sir.
It'll all be downhill.

35:14.196 --> 35:17.406
You'll trust me to wait for the guns, sir?

35:22.120 --> 35:23.996
Dr. McGuire.

35:26.374 --> 35:31.837
You're an excellent practitioner,
and I believe I will take your prescription.

35:50.565 --> 35:56.570
No fires, no tents.
Just like I always dreamed it'd be.

35:56.738 --> 36:00.950
You suppose the Virginia legislature was
gonna buy you your own personal tent?

36:01.117 --> 36:03.202
That's fine for now.

36:03.370 --> 36:09.041
You'll be humming a different tune when
it's raining, you're all covered in frost...

36:09.209 --> 36:12.920
... or you need me to dig you
out of a snowdrift.

36:13.088 --> 36:16.257
So damn dark the bats
run into each other.

36:16.424 --> 36:19.260
Old Hickory's just getting us
fit for the fighting.

36:19.427 --> 36:22.805
Old Hickory, Old Jack, Old Blue Light.

36:22.973 --> 36:26.350
How many names you got
for the old man, anyway?

36:27.269 --> 36:29.979
Them VMI boys come up
with the choice one.

36:30.146 --> 36:33.274
They calls him "Tom Fool" when
he's looking the other way.

36:33.733 --> 36:36.777
I'll be a fool if I listened
to you all livelong night.

36:38.321 --> 36:44.451
Old Tom Fool. That name ought to
stick to him like a tick on a mule.

36:47.956 --> 36:53.002
That's it! Step lively! Two at a time!

36:53.169 --> 36:58.549
As quick as you can.
No dilly, no dally.

36:58.717 --> 37:05.180
One foot forward, then the other.
Nothing pretty, nothing fancy.

37:05.348 --> 37:11.812
Into the train. Do it lovely,
do it ugly, all the same to me.

37:12.314 --> 37:15.482
- Colonel Jackson.
- Colonel Trimble.

37:15.650 --> 37:19.153
- I understand you're a train man.
- Baltimore and Ohio.

37:19.321 --> 37:23.449
Spent most of my life building lines,
and the past six months tearing them up.

37:23.783 --> 37:26.911
No use in leaving them in fine
fettle with a meddling Yankee.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.871
If you'll excuse me, sir.

37:29.039 --> 37:33.208
Got to move these men where they'll
do the most damage to the enemy.

37:39.049 --> 37:42.551
Now that's the finest dressed man
in the whole Confederate Army.

37:42.802 --> 37:46.347
In you go! Up and over!

37:46.514 --> 37:49.266
Through the brush and in the clover.

37:49.434 --> 37:53.187
Crowd on in. Move it over.

38:24.928 --> 38:27.137
Dear Lord:

38:28.264 --> 38:31.058
This is your day.

38:31.226 --> 38:34.728
And you have admonished us
to keep it holy.

38:35.522 --> 38:39.066
If it is your will that we fight this day...

38:39.234 --> 38:40.901
...then your will be done.

38:42.821 --> 38:46.407
I ask your protection over Anna...

38:47.075 --> 38:50.953
...your faithful servant, my loving wife.

38:53.123 --> 38:58.252
I ask you to shine your face down upon her,
Lord, on her 30th birthday...

38:58.420 --> 39:02.589
... and fill her heart with the conviction
of how much she is loved and missed ...

39:02.757 --> 39:04.341
... by her husband.

39:04.759 --> 39:06.927
Dear Lord:

39:07.429 --> 39:12.349
You have called me to this place, in this
hour, far from my home and my loved ones...

39:12.517 --> 39:15.227
... but I know it is your will
that leads me here.

39:15.395 --> 39:21.608
If it is your will that we fight today,
I am ready, Lord. Thy will be done.

39:21.776 --> 39:25.320
It is your sword I will wield into battle.

39:25.780 --> 39:30.200
Your banner I will raise against those
who would desecrate our land.

39:31.953 --> 39:36.623
And if it is my time to be with you, Lord ...

39:36.791 --> 39:40.794
...then I come to you
with all the joy in my heart.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.767
Amen.

40:48.530 --> 40:51.657
That's General Bee's brigade!

41:00.583 --> 41:03.377
Inform General Bee the
1st Virginians are on the field.

41:03.586 --> 41:05.963
Ask him, can he hold long enough
for me to deploy my men?

41:06.131 --> 41:08.048
Yes, sir! I'll ask him!

41:08.216 --> 41:11.301
They may not hold, gentlemen.
We must assume they cannot.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.970
- Mr. Smith.
- Sir?

41:13.138 --> 41:17.391
Instruct Imboden and Stanard to position
their batteries in the center of the crest.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.811
I want the 4th and the 27th
regiments stationed as support.

41:20.979 --> 41:26.066
I want the 5th Regiment posted to their right,
the 2nd and 33rd to the left. Understood?

41:37.579 --> 41:38.662
Counter battery fire!

41:40.331 --> 41:41.874
Eight hundred yards!

41:42.542 --> 41:47.045
- Shell! Five-second fuse!
- Fire!

41:59.851 --> 42:04.771
Counter battery fire. 800 yards.

42:04.939 --> 42:09.067
Shell, five inch. Five-second fuse.

42:15.074 --> 42:16.533
Fire!

42:28.296 --> 42:33.133
General! Our line on Matthew's Hill
has broken. They are beating us back.

42:33.301 --> 42:35.761
Then we must give them the bayonet!

42:35.970 --> 42:42.476
1 st Brigade, move up to a position just
below the crest of the hill. And stay low!

42:49.234 --> 42:50.734
Rally, men! Rally!

42:52.528 --> 42:54.071
Look!

42:54.239 --> 42:57.407
There is Jackson, standing like a stone wall.

42:57.575 --> 43:00.494
Let us determine to die here today
and we will conquer.

43:00.703 --> 43:03.497
Rally behind the Virginians!

43:19.097 --> 43:21.306
Fix bayonets.

43:21.474 --> 43:23.225
- Fix bayonets!
- Fix!

43:50.211 --> 43:52.170
Fill in there--!

43:58.219 --> 44:00.679
Instruct the men to lay down!
Hug the ground!

44:00.888 --> 44:05.350
- Lie down, men!
- Privates! First rank, lie down!

44:05.518 --> 44:08.895
Second rank, kneel!

44:27.415 --> 44:29.750
They are coming, boys.

44:30.084 --> 44:33.503
Wait till they get close before you shoot.

44:37.550 --> 44:38.717
Hold your lines!

44:43.222 --> 44:45.182
Halt!

44:48.144 --> 44:50.771
Hold your fire!

44:50.980 --> 44:52.731
Ready!

44:52.940 --> 44:54.858
Aim!

44:55.651 --> 45:01.865
Fire!

45:04.077 --> 45:05.786
Fire! Reload!

45:05.953 --> 45:08.246
- Rise up!
- Quickly, boys!

45:09.082 --> 45:10.123
Rise up!

45:13.544 --> 45:15.295
Quickly, men! Quickly!

45:17.131 --> 45:19.007
Ready!

45:19.801 --> 45:21.468
Aim!

45:23.262 --> 45:29.476
Fire!

45:35.608 --> 45:38.777
Reload! Reload, men!

45:39.737 --> 45:42.322
Come on, boys!
Quick and we can whip them!

45:42.490 --> 45:46.326
- Easy, men. We have no orders to advance!
- Get back in the ranks!

45:46.828 --> 45:50.163
Steady, men. Steady!

45:52.375 --> 45:53.667
Damn it.

45:53.835 --> 45:56.503
Charge!

46:02.176 --> 46:03.468
It's Cummings' boys.

46:06.180 --> 46:08.640
- What are they doing?
- Easy, Mr. Pendleton. Easy.

46:08.808 --> 46:11.518
Good to have your dander up,
but discipline wins the day.

46:37.044 --> 46:41.214
About-face! About-face, men!
Aim! Fire!

46:42.383 --> 46:45.427
For God's sakes, forward!

46:57.398 --> 47:00.650
General, sir, the day is going against us.

47:01.527 --> 47:05.739
If you think so, sir, you had better
not say anything about it.

47:24.800 --> 47:26.760
Rise up, rise up!

47:27.178 --> 47:29.304
Rise up, Virginia!

47:29.472 --> 47:34.434
Stand up, you men! Stand up, you free men!
We're gonna charge them.

47:34.602 --> 47:38.355
We're gonna drive them to Washington!
Stand up, Virginia!

47:40.983 --> 47:43.443
1 st Brigade...

47:43.611 --> 47:45.403
... reserve your fire...

47:45.571 --> 47:48.198
...till they come within 50 yards...

47:48.366 --> 47:50.742
...then fire!

47:50.910 --> 47:53.620
And give them the bayonet!

47:53.788 --> 47:56.331
And when you charge...

47:56.499 --> 47:58.208
...yell like Furies!

48:05.341 --> 48:09.386
- Ready! Aim!
- Aim!

48:11.597 --> 48:13.807
- Fire!
- Fire!

48:17.812 --> 48:21.106
Charge bayonets!

48:49.176 --> 48:52.887
Charge!

49:13.200 --> 49:15.869
Press on! Press on!

49:48.194 --> 49:50.487
I surrender! I surrender!

52:06.290 --> 52:08.082
General?

52:09.877 --> 52:14.214
How is it you can keep so serene...

52:14.882 --> 52:19.719
... and stay so utterly insensible...

52:20.679 --> 52:24.516
...with a storm of shells and bullets
raining about your head?

52:24.683 --> 52:27.060
Captain Smith ...

52:27.228 --> 52:32.565
... my religious belief teaches me
to feel as safe in battle as in bed.

52:32.733 --> 52:37.153
God has fixed the time for my death,
I do not concern myself with that...

52:37.321 --> 52:40.990
... but to be always ready,
whenever it may overtake me.

52:41.867 --> 52:44.619
That is the way all men should live.

52:45.412 --> 52:47.872
Then all men would be equally brave.

53:00.761 --> 53:06.558
Preliminary reports for the brigade, sir.
1 1 1 dead.

53:06.767 --> 53:10.436
Three hundred seventy-three
wounded or missing.

53:10.604 --> 53:14.274
And if I may ask, sir, how's your hand?

53:14.441 --> 53:19.445
Just a spent bullet. No more than
a scratch really, Mr. Pendleton.

53:19.613 --> 53:24.409
I'm more than pleased with the part
performed by the brigade during the action.

53:24.910 --> 53:28.162
Through the blessing of God ...

53:28.330 --> 53:32.917
...they met the thus far victorious enemy
and turned the fortunes of the day.

53:35.671 --> 53:37.922
Good evening, gentlemen.

53:38.382 --> 53:40.300
Tomorrow's a new day.

53:40.885 --> 53:42.635
- Evening, general.
- Evening, sir.

53:42.803 --> 53:44.762
Oh, Mr. Pendleton?

53:44.930 --> 53:46.723
Thank you for the report.

53:49.810 --> 53:52.645
I will never forget these men.

53:57.651 --> 54:00.194
We must never forget them.

54:04.700 --> 54:09.329
The universe itself is subject
to rules, to law.

54:09.496 --> 54:13.499
The super-abounding life lavished
on this world of ours...

54:14.043 --> 54:16.002
... is proof...

54:16.170 --> 54:18.963
...that the play of infinite freedom ...

54:19.131 --> 54:23.968
... is here to help work out
the will of infinite law.

54:24.136 --> 54:29.474
The nature of the universe demonstrates...

54:29.642 --> 54:33.978
...that freedom can only exist...

54:34.146 --> 54:36.272
... as part of law.

54:39.944 --> 54:42.028
Pardon me, Professor Chamberlain ...

54:42.196 --> 54:46.157
... but how does the study of philosophy
intersect with real life?

54:46.867 --> 54:51.079
If freedom can only exist as a part of law...

54:51.246 --> 54:54.207
... how can we continue to tolerate slavery
protected by law?

55:10.933 --> 55:12.517
Lawrence, I know.

55:14.311 --> 55:15.311
How?

55:17.189 --> 55:20.984
I've noticed the way you've been looking
into the children's room each night.

55:38.085 --> 55:39.293
Blue.

55:39.461 --> 55:43.131
Why blue uniforms? It should be red.

55:43.298 --> 55:47.969
- Like the English, the color of blood.
- Are you angry with me?

55:48.137 --> 55:49.846
Lawrence, my darling Lawrence.

55:50.055 --> 55:53.599
Do you remember when you were
thinking of being a missionary?

55:53.767 --> 55:56.728
And you wrote me saying
that you wished your little wife...

55:56.895 --> 56:00.023
...was willing for you to take
whatever course you thought best...

56:00.190 --> 56:03.526
... and was ready to help you
in it with all her heart?

56:03.694 --> 56:07.613
"Little wife."
How could I ever have called you that?

56:07.781 --> 56:10.199
Your spirit is vaster than oceans.

56:11.243 --> 56:15.538
Then you wrote back.

56:15.706 --> 56:19.292
And I have never forgotten what you said.

56:20.127 --> 56:23.463
You said, "Well, dear, she is willing ...

56:23.630 --> 56:28.885
... and she feels that you know better
about the matter than she does."

56:31.013 --> 56:33.097
But now...

56:33.474 --> 56:36.809
... I never think I know better than you.

56:38.353 --> 56:42.315
I couldn't bear for you to feel that you
must forever remain at a stand ...

56:42.483 --> 56:44.275
...just because you're married.

56:44.443 --> 56:48.821
I always want to help you on
in your excelsior striving.

56:51.283 --> 56:57.288
But I had a dream about you, Lawrence.
Last night.

56:57.456 --> 57:01.292
While you were away,
offering your services to the governor.

57:03.003 --> 57:08.841
I saw you in my dream.
There were boys in blue marching past.

57:09.176 --> 57:13.805
Some of the boys that we know.

57:13.972 --> 57:16.974
And there you were...

57:17.142 --> 57:20.520
... riding ahead of them
on a great, white horse.

57:21.522 --> 57:26.275
Fanny, my love, I felt I had to go.

57:26.485 --> 57:30.530
I offered the governor my services,
wherever he wanted to place me.

57:30.823 --> 57:34.867
I thought he'd probably order me
to an officer.

57:35.035 --> 57:39.330
Speeches, administration.

57:39.498 --> 57:41.082
Lawrence...

57:41.250 --> 57:44.544
... I know you.
When you do a thing, you do it à l'outrance.

57:45.879 --> 57:50.550
- So? He gave you a commission, didn't he?
- They need serving officers.

57:59.601 --> 58:02.228
Five new regiments are being formed now.

58:02.729 --> 58:06.858
Maine has already sent 1 5.
How could I refuse?

58:07.025 --> 58:09.694
Poor Lawrence, damn you,
you'll be good at it too.

58:10.320 --> 58:14.407
You'll be good at soldiering just like
you're good at everything else. So go.

58:14.575 --> 58:16.576
Go do your duty to your country's flag ...

58:16.743 --> 58:20.496
... go on and get your medals for bravery,
go and get yourself killed.

58:48.442 --> 58:50.109
That poem of Lovelace.

58:53.197 --> 58:59.702
That beautiful, horrible, damnable,
lovely, sad poem.

58:59.870 --> 59:03.080
I think that you recited it in my dream.

59:04.666 --> 59:07.418
Lovelace. "Off to the English Civil War"?

59:11.173 --> 59:14.634
I would not dare presume to quote it now.

59:24.394 --> 59:29.482
Tell me not, sweet, I am unkind

59:30.567 --> 59:34.820
That from the nunnery
Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind

59:34.988 --> 59:37.323
To warlike arms I fly.

59:38.659 --> 59:42.536
True, a new mistress now I serve

59:42.704 --> 59:45.498
The first foe in the field

59:45.666 --> 59:51.796
And with a sterner faith embrace
The sword, a horse, a shield.

59:56.468 --> 59:59.929
Yet this inconstancy is such

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:03.349
As thou too shalt adore.

01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:11.732
I could not love thee, dear, so much

01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:17.321
Loved I not honor more.

01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:31.335
You will be wounded.

01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:36.799
You will be changed by the horrors of it.

01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:39.885
But you will come home.

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:44.432
I believe that, my love.
You will come home.

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:06.662
Come in.

01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:11.125
You must be Mr. Lewis.

01:01:12.544 --> 01:01:15.046
There's some that calls me Uncle Jim.

01:01:15.255 --> 01:01:19.342
Some calls me Big Jim.
Some folks just calls me Jim.

01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:23.095
I don't suppose you've heard
any of the names I get called?

01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:26.432
I heard Stonewall once.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:30.144
That name properly belongs to the
1 st Virginia Brigade, not to me.

01:01:30.312 --> 01:01:34.148
- They were the ones who earned it.
- Some folks says otherwise.

01:01:34.316 --> 01:01:40.821
Folks say men can't fight without
nobody up front to lead them on.

01:01:40.989 --> 01:01:45.284
- I'm told you're a first-rate cook.
- Yes, sir.

01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:49.622
They wasn't lying, told you that.
Whatever you likes to eat, I can cook it.

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:54.043
Pan-fry, griddle, boil, bake. Roasted.

01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:59.715
And I understand you're from Lexington.
You come highly recommended to me, Jim.

01:02:00.634 --> 01:02:04.887
Lexington is my home, general.
Same as yours.

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:08.599
If I could do my share
in defending my home...

01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:11.060
... I'd be doing the same as you.

01:02:11.478 --> 01:02:15.189
I heard it was Napoleon hisself said:

01:02:15.357 --> 01:02:19.151
"An army can't march but on its stomach ."

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:25.199
Well ...

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:27.952
If you love your country...

01:02:28.495 --> 01:02:30.496
...fear the Lord ...

01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:35.000
... and have no trouble getting up at
4: 00 in the morning, the job is yours.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:43.134
Yous got yourself a deal, general.

01:02:43.343 --> 01:02:45.678
Sir.

01:03:03.155 --> 01:03:06.240
My darling esposita.

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:12.788
Welcome to Winchester.

01:03:12.956 --> 01:03:16.333
Thomas.

01:03:16.835 --> 01:03:20.045
- Come in out of the cold.
- Why, thank you.

01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:33.934
I have been thinking, Thomas...

01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:41.692
...that it may have been a blessing the Battle
of Manassas was fought on my birthday.

01:03:42.694 --> 01:03:44.820
Why is that?

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:51.243
In our old age, you will never forget it.

01:03:55.540 --> 01:04:00.419
I will forget my own
before I ever forget yours.

01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:06.217
Oh, Anna.

01:04:06.384 --> 01:04:08.260
Anna.

01:04:09.554 --> 01:04:12.097
What is it, Tom?

01:04:12.974 --> 01:04:14.808
What?

01:04:19.606 --> 01:04:26.070
Everything in this life seems so fragile.

01:04:26.655 --> 01:04:28.614
So temporary.

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:36.038
When we are separated, I fear...

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:38.958
... I will never see you again.

01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:43.796
I fear we may never have a child.

01:04:46.466 --> 01:04:50.928
I fear I may lose you
if we dare to have a child.

01:04:51.096 --> 01:04:55.057
I know I should trust in the Lord ...

01:04:55.892 --> 01:05:01.981
... but then I see the face
of my dear mama...

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:08.988
... of my first wife, dead and cold.

01:05:09.489 --> 01:05:11.448
With our dead daughter.

01:05:12.784 --> 01:05:17.246
Dead before she could draw
her first breath in this world.

01:05:18.665 --> 01:05:20.082
And I am afraid.

01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:28.507
And I am afraid to feel happiness.

01:05:28.675 --> 01:05:32.928
Afraid to hope for it again.

01:05:33.305 --> 01:05:37.308
I am afraid of God's judgment.

01:05:39.019 --> 01:05:43.981
We serve a loving God, Thomas.

01:05:44.858 --> 01:05:48.402
We are in each other's arms.

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:53.532
We are together,
and we are happy together.

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:58.078
And is our love not proof of his?

01:05:59.414 --> 01:06:02.708
We must not fear, Thomas.

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:06.712
We will survive this war.

01:06:07.505 --> 01:06:10.424
And we will have a child.

01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:13.886
So help us, God.

01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:38.994
This is a hell of a regiment.

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:44.333
Men of the 20th Maine Regiment
of Volunteers...

01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:48.337
...this is your commanding officer,
Colonel Adelbert Ames.

01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:51.590
Quiet! Quiet!

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:55.219
You do not cheer an officer.

01:06:55.387 --> 01:06:56.679
You salute him.

01:06:57.472 --> 01:07:00.349
20th Maine, I commend you
for the enthusiasm ...

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:03.852
...that has made you volunteer
for service in Lincoln's Army.

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:07.773
I can see that many of you
are strong and fit.

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:11.443
We Maine men know that
life in the woods of Maine...

01:07:11.611 --> 01:07:14.488
...toughens the muscles
and stretches the sinews.

01:07:14.656 --> 01:07:18.075
I've no doubt many of you
have become good shots by hunting deer.

01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:23.122
But tough muscles and skillful shooting
are not enough to make a soldier.

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:26.041
That requires discipline.

01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:30.546
Major Gilmore tells me you are in the habit
of holding discussions with your officers.

01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:33.298
That will cease from now.

01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:38.679
An officer's orders are to be obeyed
instantly and without question.

01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:43.600
This regiment must learn
to move as one man.

01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:47.563
Otherwise we will all be killed.

01:07:54.154 --> 01:07:56.697
Sergeant Tom Chamberlain
reporting for duty, sir.

01:07:56.865 --> 01:07:58.949
Tom, what on earth--?
What are you doing?

01:07:59.117 --> 01:08:02.703
I signed up, Lawrence, I'm in this regiment.
I'm coming with you.

01:08:02.871 --> 01:08:05.622
Did Father approve?
How will he run the farm?

01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:08.584
Once he heard you were colonel,
he couldn't say no.

01:08:08.752 --> 01:08:11.587
Besides, you know him,
he'll be all right. They both will.

01:08:11.755 --> 01:08:14.006
I'm giving them one less thing to cuss at.

01:08:14.174 --> 01:08:18.594
Mama said so many prayers for the both
of us, we got nothing to worry about.

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:22.848
Well, I guess I have one more responsibility.
I have to look after you.

01:08:23.475 --> 01:08:24.558
Me?

01:08:24.725 --> 01:08:27.685
Lawrence, Mama told me
to watch after you.

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:46.537
Line of battle consists of two lines of men,
one behind the other...

01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:49.707
... so that while one line fires,
the other reloads.

01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:55.087
Behind them is a line of file closers.
Lieutenants and sergeants.

01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:57.883
But two lines make a regiment
unwieldy on the move...

01:08:58.051 --> 01:09:00.301
... so we need to switch to column of fours.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:04.014
We need to be able to change from
column of fours to line of battle...

01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:05.849
... and back again quickly.

01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:09.310
lt is not difficult to move from line of battle
into column of fours.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:12.773
lt is harder to move from
column of fours into line of battle...

01:09:12.941 --> 01:09:16.819
...and if we're called to make that move,
it will be when we're under fire.

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:21.448
You understand how important it is that
these moves are learned so thoroughly...

01:09:21.616 --> 01:09:24.827
...that the men can perform them
in their sleep.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:36.712
Company...

01:09:37.381 --> 01:09:39.299
... halt!

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:43.636
Company, front!

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.060
Order arms!

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:02.614
Well done, colonel. That's a beginning.

01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:06.034
But that move must be practiced
and practiced and practiced.

01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:08.120
Another month and we'll be ready.

01:10:08.288 --> 01:10:11.248
But we leave for Washington tomorrow.

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:19.298
Shoulder arms!

01:10:22.427 --> 01:10:26.889
Company, forward march!

01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:50.454
Morning to you, sir.
Colonel Ames sent me to get you.

01:10:50.622 --> 01:10:54.791
- Said you might be needing a drop of this.
- Thank you ...

01:10:55.001 --> 01:11:00.172
Kilrain, sir. Sergeant Kilrain.
Glad to be of service.

01:11:01.174 --> 01:11:03.300
You know, colonel ...

01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:05.719
...the boys...

01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:08.305
We've been watching you, sir,
that we have.

01:11:08.806 --> 01:11:12.517
You've learned fast.
Becoming a pleasure to serve under you.

01:11:12.685 --> 01:11:14.478
Yes, well ...

01:11:14.646 --> 01:11:16.855
Are you a veteran, sergeant?

01:11:17.023 --> 01:11:19.816
Aye, sir. I suppose you could say that.

01:11:19.984 --> 01:11:22.486
Did me duty in the regular Army for a while.

01:11:22.654 --> 01:11:28.617
Did the great long walk with General Scott,
down south of the Rio Grande.

01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:32.663
Some men you fought with are on
the other side. Almost all of their generals.

01:11:32.956 --> 01:11:36.333
Oh, it gets worse than generals, colonel.

01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:41.755
Some of the lads that I left Ireland with
are on the other side as well. Imagine that.

01:11:41.923 --> 01:11:44.341
We left together to escape a tyranny...

01:11:44.884 --> 01:11:48.845
... and end up shooting at one another
in the land of the free.

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:56.520
I, too, have friends
on the other side, sergeant.

01:11:56.688 --> 01:11:58.021
And enemies.

01:11:59.023 --> 01:12:00.691
Yes, sir.

01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:04.444
No shortage of enemies, that's for sure.

01:12:12.245 --> 01:12:14.955
Forward!

01:12:15.123 --> 01:12:17.290
Rest!

01:12:23.297 --> 01:12:26.883
Throughout the broad extent
of the country...

01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:30.137
...through which you have marched ...

01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:35.225
... by your respect for the rights
and property of others...

01:12:35.893 --> 01:12:39.438
...you have always shown you are soldiers,
not only to defend ...

01:12:40.398 --> 01:12:44.151
... but able and willing
both to defend and protect.

01:12:44.318 --> 01:12:46.820
You've already won ...

01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:51.825
... a brilliant reputation throughout the Army
of the whole Confederacy.

01:12:51.993 --> 01:12:55.537
And I trust in the future
by your deeds in the field ...

01:12:56.914 --> 01:13:01.418
... and by the assistance of the same kind
providence who has favored our cause...

01:13:01.586 --> 01:13:07.257
...you will win more victories and add
luster to the reputation you now enjoy.

01:13:08.843 --> 01:13:12.429
You already gained a proud position ...

01:13:12.847 --> 01:13:15.932
... in the future history of this...

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:18.894
... our second war of independence.

01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:27.110
I shall look with anxiety
to your future movements...

01:13:27.528 --> 01:13:31.364
... and I trust whenever I shall hear
of the 1 st Brigade...

01:13:31.532 --> 01:13:33.700
... on the field of battle...

01:13:33.868 --> 01:13:39.623
... it will be of still nobler deeds achieved
and higher reputation won.

01:13:44.962 --> 01:13:50.383
In the Army of the Shenandoah,
you were the 1 st Brigade.

01:13:50.885 --> 01:13:54.262
In the Army of the Potomac,
you were the 1 st Brigade.

01:13:54.806 --> 01:13:58.975
In the 2nd Corps of this Army,
you are the 1 st Brigade.

01:13:59.143 --> 01:14:03.688
You are the 1 st Brigade
in the affections of your general.

01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:09.861
And I hope by your future deeds and bearing
you will be handed down to posterity...

01:14:10.655 --> 01:14:13.073
... as the 1 st Brigade...

01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:16.701
... in this, our second war of independence.

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:25.252
Godspeed!

01:14:31.843 --> 01:14:35.428
Jackson! Jackson! Jackson! Jackson!

01:14:35.596 --> 01:14:39.224
Jackson! Jackson! Jackson!

01:14:51.529 --> 01:14:53.613
Gentlemen.

01:14:54.198 --> 01:14:55.782
Excuse us, General Burnside...

01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:58.952
... General Hancock has information
you may find useful.

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:02.873
Yes, General Hancock, a pleasure.
Sumner, come.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.457
We have visitors.

01:15:04.625 --> 01:15:08.920
Sir, General Hancock reports the river
can be forded the short way upstream.

01:15:09.088 --> 01:15:14.634
There'll be no difficulty crossing. With
your permission, we can move right away.

01:15:14.802 --> 01:15:18.096
General Hancock, I appreciate your efforts
at reconnaissance...

01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:21.892
... but this possibility has been
considered and rejected.

01:15:22.059 --> 01:15:23.935
The pontoons will be here any time.

01:15:24.103 --> 01:15:27.647
We'll cross with not only the men
but also the wagons and supplies.

01:15:27.815 --> 01:15:31.651
It would be foolhardy to send the men
without the wagons, the big guns--

01:15:31.819 --> 01:15:34.237
Excuse me, am I correct
in my observation ...

01:15:34.405 --> 01:15:37.657
...that there's little force opposing us
across the river?

01:15:37.825 --> 01:15:39.492
Yes, you're absolutely correct.

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:42.245
For once we seem to have caught
Lee by surprise.

01:15:42.413 --> 01:15:47.584
Then, sir, if I may suggest,
isn't it possible Lee is moving this way?

01:15:48.252 --> 01:15:52.714
Certainly he's aware of our intentions. If
we could occupy the town with infantry...

01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:56.468
... it would make our job much easier
when the bridges do arrive.

01:15:56.636 --> 01:16:00.263
Yes, but that's risky. Those men
could be cut off. In this weather?

01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:04.100
It snows one day, melts the next.
The river could rise unexpectedly.

01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:09.064
It will be best, I assure you, if we wait
until the entire Army can cross together.

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:12.108
General Burnside, if we don't cross
the river soon ...

01:16:12.276 --> 01:16:15.111
... General Lee will make every effort
to stop us.

01:16:15.696 --> 01:16:18.448
He will not let us move
toward Richmond unopposed.

01:16:18.616 --> 01:16:20.784
Where are General Jackson's forces now?

01:16:20.952 --> 01:16:23.536
Shouldn't we attempt to occupy
Fredericksburg ...

01:16:23.704 --> 01:16:28.208
... and possibly the Heights beyond now,
while we have it for the taking?

01:16:28.376 --> 01:16:33.922
Please allow me, sir, to at least send
General Hancock's division across the river.

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:37.133
Surely they can carry
enough supplies with them ...

01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:42.555
... and the artillery from this side can protect
them against any advance by Lee.

01:16:44.392 --> 01:16:50.814
Gentlemen, we will cross this river
when the bridges arrive and not before.

01:16:50.982 --> 01:16:54.609
I do not have the luxury of deviating
from the larger plan.

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:57.988
The president approved my strategy,
and I shall stick to it.

01:16:58.155 --> 01:17:03.910
Once this Army is across the river,
we will advance on Richmond in force.

01:17:05.413 --> 01:17:07.539
We must not allow him ...

01:17:07.707 --> 01:17:12.252
...the luxury of attacking us as divided and
separated units as he's done in the past.

01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:15.839
And I will not make the same mistake
as my predecessors.

01:17:16.007 --> 01:17:18.925
So no, General Hancock.

01:17:19.093 --> 01:17:22.470
You will stay on this side
until the pontoons are in place...

01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:26.266
... and the entire Army crosses together.

01:17:26.434 --> 01:17:30.645
An irresistible, impregnable force.

01:17:38.195 --> 01:17:41.698
Did you know George Washington
spent his boyhood not far from here?

01:17:42.283 --> 01:17:46.286
And across that river, he's supposed
to have thrown that silver dollar...

01:17:46.454 --> 01:17:49.372
... and cut down that cherry tree.

01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:54.711
That may be so, Mr. Taylor, but it has
an even greater significance for me.

01:17:54.962 --> 01:17:57.297
It's where I met my wife.

01:17:57.465 --> 01:18:01.259
That's something these Yankees
do not understand, will never understand.

01:18:01.886 --> 01:18:05.221
You see these rivers and valleys
and streams...

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:08.058
... and fields, even towns?

01:18:08.225 --> 01:18:12.896
They're just markings on a map to those
people in the war office in Washington.

01:18:13.064 --> 01:18:18.401
But to us, my goodness, they're
birthplaces and burial grounds.

01:18:18.569 --> 01:18:21.488
They're battlefields
where our ancestors fought...

01:18:21.655 --> 01:18:25.200
... places where you and I learned
to walk, to talk and to pray.

01:18:25.409 --> 01:18:31.081
Places where we made friendships
and, oh, yes, fell in love.

01:18:32.333 --> 01:18:38.797
And they're the incarnation
of all our memories, Mr. Taylor...

01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:41.508
... and all that we are.

01:18:42.343 --> 01:18:44.844
All that we are.

01:19:19.213 --> 01:19:21.464
- What place is this?
- Chancellor's Crossing.

01:19:21.632 --> 01:19:25.051
We're another two hours or so
from Fredericksburg.

01:19:25.719 --> 01:19:28.221
We'll rest here for a short time.

01:19:28.389 --> 01:19:31.808
Yes, sir. I'll see what
the good folks can provide.

01:19:40.651 --> 01:19:44.404
The general be fixing to eat
something warm?

01:19:44.572 --> 01:19:46.322
No, no, Jim.

01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:49.742
We gotta ride on straight
through to General Lee.

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:54.330
Don't want to get all warmed up
just to feel the cold all over again.

01:19:55.499 --> 01:19:57.917
You never seem to mind the cold much.

01:19:58.085 --> 01:20:02.589
I minds it. I just don't shows it.

01:20:04.175 --> 01:20:07.677
Now, Little Sorrel, I know
this corn look poorly...

01:20:07.845 --> 01:20:11.514
... but it sure beats no corn at all.

01:20:18.939 --> 01:20:22.108
You heard from your family lately?

01:20:22.943 --> 01:20:26.279
Ain't heared much for some time.

01:20:26.447 --> 01:20:31.034
Yankee mail used to move
quicker than Secesh mail.

01:20:34.538 --> 01:20:40.627
Lord, from where you sit
you can see the great distance...

01:20:40.794 --> 01:20:44.214
...that separates our Southern men
from their wives and children.

01:20:44.882 --> 01:20:48.468
We pray that you watch over our families.

01:20:49.887 --> 01:20:53.139
Lord, I ask you to watch over
Jim Lewis' family...

01:20:53.307 --> 01:20:57.227
... over his friends, his loved ones,
wherever they may be.

01:20:57.394 --> 01:21:01.981
Lord, I know you sees
into the hearts of all men ...

01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:05.068
...just like you sees into the heart
of old Jim Lewis.

01:21:07.321 --> 01:21:12.575
And, Lord, I know there's
no lying or deceitfulness...

01:21:12.743 --> 01:21:14.744
... can hide from you.

01:21:15.663 --> 01:21:16.829
You find the truth ...

01:21:16.997 --> 01:21:23.419
... in the bottom of the deepest pit
of darkness.

01:21:23.587 --> 01:21:28.550
There be no hiding from your truth
and your ever-watchful eye.

01:21:29.176 --> 01:21:31.010
Amen.

01:21:31.178 --> 01:21:32.762
How is it, Lord?

01:21:33.847 --> 01:21:38.017
Can you explain something
to this old Virginia man?

01:21:38.686 --> 01:21:42.939
How is it a good Christian man ...

01:21:43.107 --> 01:21:45.191
... like some folks I know...

01:21:45.359 --> 01:21:49.862
... can tolerate their black brothers
in bondage?

01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:53.950
How is it, Lord, they don't just...

01:21:54.618 --> 01:21:57.537
... break them chains?

01:21:58.706 --> 01:22:01.291
How is it, Lord?

01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:05.962
My heart is open and aching.

01:22:06.130 --> 01:22:07.922
And I wants to know.

01:22:13.637 --> 01:22:15.722
Lord, speak to us.

01:22:15.889 --> 01:22:17.140
Speak to your children.

01:22:17.308 --> 01:22:23.062
Speak to Jim Lewis and Thomas Jackson,
your humble and obedient servants.

01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:25.857
Speak to all of us.

01:22:26.233 --> 01:22:29.068
Our hearts are open.

01:22:29.737 --> 01:22:32.155
Lord, you show us the way, we will follow.

01:22:37.745 --> 01:22:42.832
Amen.

01:22:54.428 --> 01:22:56.846
- Jim?
- Yeah.

01:22:58.682 --> 01:23:00.558
What is the status of your family?

01:23:01.018 --> 01:23:04.771
About half is free, half slave.

01:23:04.938 --> 01:23:08.775
That's counting all the cousins and such.

01:23:09.443 --> 01:23:12.612
You must know that there are
some officers in this Army...

01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:15.281
...who are of the opinion that...

01:23:15.449 --> 01:23:19.702
...we should be enlisting Negroes
as a condition for freedom.

01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:21.954
General Lee is among them.

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:24.540
That's what they says around the camp.

01:23:24.708 --> 01:23:29.545
Your people will be free,
one way or another.

01:23:29.713 --> 01:23:32.715
The question is, if the Southern government
will have...

01:23:32.883 --> 01:23:36.135
...the good sense to do it first and soon.

01:23:36.303 --> 01:23:40.223
And in so doing seal a bond
of enduring friendship between us.

01:23:43.143 --> 01:23:46.145
That's what they says, general.

01:23:47.314 --> 01:23:50.650
God's plan is a great mystery.

01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:54.320
It will be revealed to us.

01:24:03.414 --> 01:24:06.666
That's all the fodder you get tonight.

01:24:06.834 --> 01:24:11.003
We's going to a country where there's
nothing more for an animal to eat...

01:24:11.171 --> 01:24:15.341
...than there is what's in the palm
of my hand.

01:24:28.313 --> 01:24:30.273
General Lee, fine day, sir.

01:24:30.441 --> 01:24:34.444
We got batteries all along that hill,
covering our front to the river.

01:24:34.611 --> 01:24:36.112
Strong anchor on the north.

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:39.490
Tomorrow, guns will be positioned
in those trees to the south.

01:24:39.783 --> 01:24:43.703
We'll be able to cover the entire
open ground, all of it.

01:24:43.871 --> 01:24:48.458
General, they gonna come at us here?

01:24:48.625 --> 01:24:50.960
Colonel Alexander...

01:24:51.128 --> 01:24:55.173
... Federal troops amassed across that river
are watching us prepare for them.

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:58.009
If I were General Burnside,
I wouldn't attack here.

01:24:58.177 --> 01:25:01.304
I'd move back upstream,
come across from above us.

01:25:01.472 --> 01:25:04.223
Burnside is not a man
with the luxury of flexibility.

01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:07.810
He's being pushed from behind
by loud voices in Washington ...

01:25:07.978 --> 01:25:11.397
... by newspapers
who demand quick action.

01:25:11.565 --> 01:25:14.942
But we're here,
and so he will attack us here.

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:17.695
We got batteries pointing from all angles.

01:25:17.863 --> 01:25:20.364
They cross that canal,
that'll slow them down.

01:25:20.908 --> 01:25:23.075
We shall hit them from all sides.

01:25:23.243 --> 01:25:26.162
No, sir, a chicken couldn't live
on that field.

01:25:26.997 --> 01:25:30.750
General Hood, I've often wondered
how it is that...

01:25:30.918 --> 01:25:35.671
... Texas men, the most independent-minded
in this Army of irascibles...

01:25:35.839 --> 01:25:38.508
... have agreed to serve under
a Kentuckian.

01:25:38.675 --> 01:25:41.677
I have often wondered the same.

01:25:42.429 --> 01:25:48.017
General Gregg, have you settled your
differences with General Jackson?

01:25:48.268 --> 01:25:51.437
No, General Hill, I have not.

01:25:51.939 --> 01:25:54.106
Have you?

01:25:55.609 --> 01:25:57.944
No, sir.

01:26:00.739 --> 01:26:02.782
Tell me, general ...

01:26:03.492 --> 01:26:07.453
... do you expect to live
until the end of this war?

01:26:09.706 --> 01:26:12.458
I do not know...

01:26:13.961 --> 01:26:16.295
... but I'm inclined to think I will.

01:26:16.463 --> 01:26:18.840
I expect I will be wounded.

01:26:20.050 --> 01:26:22.468
And you, general?

01:26:23.637 --> 01:26:27.890
I do not expect to live to see
the end of this war.

01:26:28.642 --> 01:26:33.563
Nor can I say that without victory
I would desire to do so.

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:41.237
- Get up.
- Get up.

01:26:48.745 --> 01:26:50.997
Sir?

01:26:51.498 --> 01:26:55.042
Yes, Mr. Pendleton, you may enter.

01:26:55.210 --> 01:26:58.754
Forgive me, general.
There's a letter for you.

01:26:58.922 --> 01:27:04.594
Courier was running a little slow today,
but I thought you'd want to see it.

01:27:05.679 --> 01:27:07.096
Yes, thank you.

01:27:08.265 --> 01:27:10.683
Good night, sir.

01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:48.054
My own dear father:

01:27:49.556 --> 01:27:53.559
As my mother's letter
has been cut short by my arrival...

01:27:53.727 --> 01:27:56.812
... I think it but justice
that I should continue it.

01:27:57.689 --> 01:28:00.816
I know that you are rejoiced
to hear of my coming.

01:28:00.984 --> 01:28:05.237
And I hope that God has sent me
to radiate your pathway through life.

01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:09.325
I am a very tiny little thing.

01:28:09.493 --> 01:28:11.744
I weigh only eight and a half pounds...

01:28:11.912 --> 01:28:17.416
...and Aunt Harriet says I am
the express image of my darling papa.

01:28:17.584 --> 01:28:20.753
My mother is very comfortable
this morning.

01:28:21.672 --> 01:28:25.591
Your loving daughter.

01:28:32.349 --> 01:28:34.934
Thank you, Lord.

01:28:35.102 --> 01:28:37.687
Thank you.

01:28:37.938 --> 01:28:39.772
Thank you, thank you.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:43.776
They've occupied all the buildings
along the riverfront.

01:28:43.944 --> 01:28:47.530
We will be lining up those pontoon
bridges through a hail of lead.

01:28:48.031 --> 01:28:51.867
Once across, the Rebs are sure
to make us pay for every block.

01:28:52.035 --> 01:28:55.538
Beyond the town is the canal
which cuts across this open field ...

01:28:55.706 --> 01:29:00.084
... a field we'll have to cross to reach
their entrenchments on Marye's Heights...

01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:03.879
... another difficult obstacle
in the face of artillery fire.

01:29:04.047 --> 01:29:06.799
Down to our left we could burst through ...

01:29:06.967 --> 01:29:12.388
...turn Jackson's lines, push him back,
trap Longstreet on top of the hill ...

01:29:12.556 --> 01:29:14.181
... surround him.

01:29:16.476 --> 01:29:17.935
It's possible.

01:29:19.146 --> 01:29:22.148
Turn Jackson's lines?

01:29:22.816 --> 01:29:25.651
No, general, we'll meet them head on.

01:29:25.819 --> 01:29:28.320
And it will be a bloody mess.

01:29:28.488 --> 01:29:30.448
We'll march up to that hill there...

01:29:30.615 --> 01:29:35.494
... and we'll eat their artillery fire
all the way across this field.

01:29:43.003 --> 01:29:45.921
We'll be able to look
at ourselves and say:

01:29:46.089 --> 01:29:48.966
"We're good soldiers.
We did what we were told ."

01:29:49.134 --> 01:29:53.846
If we're not successful, we can say it was
a good plan, but there were contingencies.

01:29:54.014 --> 01:29:55.931
You can go back to your hometown ...

01:29:56.099 --> 01:30:00.186
... and tell the families of your men
they died doing their duty.

01:30:01.021 --> 01:30:04.523
The Rebs have fortified
the high ground up the river.

01:30:04.691 --> 01:30:08.944
And anyway, there are strong currents
and obstacles to a crossing there.

01:30:09.112 --> 01:30:11.447
Below Fredericksburg the river is too wide.

01:30:11.615 --> 01:30:14.658
And our earliest forces are
clear down to Port Royal.

01:30:15.035 --> 01:30:18.954
Fredericksburg is now
the only place we can cross.

01:30:19.122 --> 01:30:24.710
If Burnside doesn't cross here,
he might as well resign.

01:30:27.172 --> 01:30:32.051
That wily gray fox has outmaneuvered
our command again.

01:30:32.385 --> 01:30:35.679
And there's going to be hell to pay.

01:31:04.376 --> 01:31:05.709
Hurry up! Let's go!

01:31:08.255 --> 01:31:09.839
Pick your targets, boys!

01:31:10.507 --> 01:31:12.383
Commence firing!

01:31:54.759 --> 01:31:58.971
Them Yankees is coming, sure as Jesus.
They got two pontoons across that river.

01:31:59.139 --> 01:32:01.640
We got to get you and them children
out of here.

01:32:01.808 --> 01:32:05.394
Stop fussing with me. Get your family
ready. We'll leave together.

01:32:05.562 --> 01:32:09.064
Miss Jane, us done talked this over,
and we decided to stay here...

01:32:09.232 --> 01:32:11.817
... and look after the house.
No use saying no more.

01:32:11.985 --> 01:32:15.154
Martha, I won't leave you to the mercy
of those blue devils.

01:32:15.322 --> 01:32:18.824
Miss Jane, you know they ain't gonna be
bothering us colored folks.

01:32:18.992 --> 01:32:23.495
If we go with you, there won't be any food
left in the pantry when we come back.

01:32:23.663 --> 01:32:26.248
And we need to eat, same as you.

01:32:29.169 --> 01:32:32.338
- Pastor Lacy, we must run to our lines.
- There's no time.

01:32:32.505 --> 01:32:34.965
The streets are raining iron.
To the basement.

01:32:52.025 --> 01:32:54.777
Anybody hurt?

01:32:54.945 --> 01:32:57.196
Sam?

01:32:59.950 --> 01:33:02.117
Easy.

01:33:04.704 --> 01:33:06.538
Sam!

01:33:06.706 --> 01:33:09.458
Can you get up? Easy! Easy!

01:33:48.999 --> 01:33:50.749
Mother? Are you here?

01:33:50.917 --> 01:33:53.585
Oh, praise be! It's young John!

01:33:53.753 --> 01:33:57.131
- We're down here in the cellar!
- The door is blocked!

01:33:57.590 --> 01:34:00.426
I'll go around to the side!

01:34:04.597 --> 01:34:08.684
Children, y'all stay right here.
Mama'll be back.

01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:11.687
Come out! There's an ambulance out front.

01:34:11.855 --> 01:34:14.064
The enemy is crossing the river. Hurry!

01:34:34.210 --> 01:34:39.048
- No! Martha, I won't leave without you.
- I done told you, I'm staying.

01:34:39.215 --> 01:34:41.550
Off with you then.

01:34:43.386 --> 01:34:46.305
Come on, Martha.

01:34:46.473 --> 01:34:49.099
Stay in the basement!

01:36:55.018 --> 01:36:56.727
Get the bayonets!

01:37:41.397 --> 01:37:43.482
May God be with them.

01:37:43.650 --> 01:37:48.153
May he strengthen their hearts
and their arms for the coming struggle.

01:37:48.321 --> 01:37:51.031
Give them the victory.

01:38:05.922 --> 01:38:09.675
Can I be of service
to you fine Northern gentlemen?

01:38:09.842 --> 01:38:11.927
Is this your master's place?

01:38:12.095 --> 01:38:13.595
This is my place.

01:38:17.016 --> 01:38:18.100
Children!

01:38:26.484 --> 01:38:28.360
Sorry to have to bother you, ma'am.

01:38:28.528 --> 01:38:31.029
Come on, let's go.

01:38:32.365 --> 01:38:35.117
Go back inside. Hurry up.

01:38:41.499 --> 01:38:44.167
Put a stop to this at once!
Where are the officers?

01:38:45.878 --> 01:38:49.631
Drop that, soldier. Now!

01:38:50.466 --> 01:38:53.051
Get a message to Couch, to Hancock.

01:38:53.219 --> 01:38:58.432
This will not be tolerated!
This is an army, not a rabble!

01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:16.992
General Longstreet, show us
where your troops are positioned.

01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:22.164
Yes, sir. We're anchored on the north
by Anderson's division ...

01:39:22.332 --> 01:39:25.334
... up on the bend in the river
and Ransom's division ...

01:39:25.668 --> 01:39:28.837
... along and below the ridge
of Marye's Heights...

01:39:29.005 --> 01:39:33.925
...with Cobb's brigade dug in down
on the road behind that stone wall.

01:39:34.093 --> 01:39:37.095
Now, to their right, is General McLaws...

01:39:37.263 --> 01:39:42.100
... and further down in the woods
and to the right, Pickett and Hood.

01:39:42.268 --> 01:39:44.394
General Hood is my right flank.

01:39:45.188 --> 01:39:50.108
He's connected in those heavy trees
over there with General Jackson's left.

01:39:50.276 --> 01:39:53.362
Up here on the Heights,
we have the Washington artillery...

01:39:53.529 --> 01:39:56.698
... Colonel Alexander's batteries
and support.

01:39:56.866 --> 01:39:59.034
It's a strong line, general.

01:39:59.202 --> 01:40:00.202
Very well.

01:40:00.703 --> 01:40:04.623
General Jackson, would you please extend
the line for us?

01:40:04.791 --> 01:40:08.877
General A. P. Hill is on the left,
adjoining General Hood.

01:40:09.045 --> 01:40:12.547
Position is supported by General Taliaferro
and General Early.

01:40:12.715 --> 01:40:16.051
Now to the right flank and behind
is D. H. Hill.

01:40:16.302 --> 01:40:19.596
We've built a road behind our lines
running the entire length.

01:40:19.764 --> 01:40:22.516
We can move troops as is necessary.

01:40:22.684 --> 01:40:25.894
If the enemy penetrates our lines
at any point...

01:40:26.062 --> 01:40:30.023
...the reserves, Taliaferro and Early,
can move rapidly to a new position.

01:40:30.191 --> 01:40:32.442
If the enemy attempts to cut our center...

01:40:32.610 --> 01:40:36.113
... or if General Pickett is pressed,
we can change positions, sir.

01:40:36.656 --> 01:40:38.240
Good, very good.

01:40:38.408 --> 01:40:42.244
General Stuart, are you in a strong position
for protecting ...

01:40:42.412 --> 01:40:43.912
... General Jackson's flank?

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:45.080
Oh, yes, sir.

01:40:45.248 --> 01:40:48.834
We're covering the enemy from the river,
as far out as our own lines.

01:40:49.001 --> 01:40:53.630
If the Yankees move down river or
threaten to turn General Jackson's line...

01:40:54.090 --> 01:40:56.925
...we can block their advance
until the line is moved.

01:40:57.093 --> 01:41:02.347
Very well. Gentlemen,
these deployments are sound.

01:41:04.517 --> 01:41:06.601
The rest is in God's hands.

01:41:06.769 --> 01:41:09.312
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:41:16.529 --> 01:41:18.947
In the Roman civil war...

01:41:19.615 --> 01:41:22.492
... Julius Caesar knew he had
to march on Rome itself...

01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:25.454
...which no legion was permitted to do.

01:41:25.621 --> 01:41:30.208
Marcus Lucanus left us a chronicle
of what happened.

01:41:32.044 --> 01:41:35.297
How swiftly Caesar had surmounted
the icy Alps...

01:41:35.465 --> 01:41:40.552
...and in his mind conceived
immense upheavals, coming war.

01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:44.890
When he reached the little Rubicon,
clearly through the murky night...

01:41:45.057 --> 01:41:49.060
...appeared a mighty image
of his country in distress...

01:41:49.896 --> 01:41:52.481
... grief in her face...

01:41:52.648 --> 01:41:56.693
... her white hair streaming
from her tower-crowned head.

01:41:56.861 --> 01:42:02.157
With tresses torn and shoulders bare,
she stood before him and sighing, said:

01:42:02.325 --> 01:42:07.037
"Where further do you march? Where
do you take my standards, warriors?

01:42:07.205 --> 01:42:12.209
If lawfully you come, if as citizens,
this far only is allowed."

01:42:14.504 --> 01:42:16.338
Trembling struck his limbs.

01:42:16.506 --> 01:42:20.926
And weakness checked his progress,
holding his feet at the river's edge.

01:42:21.093 --> 01:42:22.552
At last he speaks.

01:42:22.929 --> 01:42:25.263
Oh, thunderer...

01:42:25.431 --> 01:42:30.268
... surveying great Rome's walls
from the Tarpeian rock.

01:42:30.436 --> 01:42:32.604
Oh, Phrygian, house gods of Iulus...

01:42:32.772 --> 01:42:36.399
... clan and mysteries of Quirinus
who was carried off to heaven.

01:42:36.692 --> 01:42:41.613
Oh, Jupiter of Latium, seated
in lofty Alba and hearths of Vesta.

01:42:41.781 --> 01:42:46.993
Oh, Rome, equal to the highest deity,
favor my plans.

01:42:47.203 --> 01:42:49.371
Not with impious weapons do I pursue you.

01:42:51.457 --> 01:42:53.291
Here am I, Caesar...

01:42:53.459 --> 01:42:57.295
...conqueror of land and sea,
your own soldier everywhere...

01:42:57.463 --> 01:43:00.882
...now too if I am permitted.

01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:06.221
The man who makes me your enemy,
it is he will be the guilty one.

01:43:08.516 --> 01:43:11.560
He broke the barriers of war
and through the swollen river...

01:43:11.727 --> 01:43:14.980
...swiftly took his standards.

01:43:15.147 --> 01:43:18.817
When Caesar crossed the flood
and reached the opposite bank...

01:43:18.985 --> 01:43:23.697
...from Hesperia's forbidden fields,
he took his stand and said:

01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:28.410
"Here, I abandoned peace
and desecrated law.

01:43:28.578 --> 01:43:31.496
Fortune, it is you I follow.

01:43:31.664 --> 01:43:36.960
Farewell to treaties.
From now on, war is our judge."

01:43:44.010 --> 01:43:47.012
Hail Caesar.

01:43:47.179 --> 01:43:50.974
We who are about to die salute you.

01:44:13.039 --> 01:44:14.664
General Zook!

01:44:14.957 --> 01:44:17.167
Move your brigade forward!

01:44:17.335 --> 01:44:21.338
Left wing, forward march!

01:45:08.386 --> 01:45:12.472
Steady, boys, steady.
You'll soon be forward.

01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:14.766
Is that to be
General Meagher's position?

01:45:14.934 --> 01:45:18.061
He's enjoying the privilege of an officer.
Protecting the rear.

01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:20.230
He's got a lame knee, for pity's sake.

01:45:20.398 --> 01:45:22.983
Fair enough.
Someone's got to keep Burnside company.

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:25.402
Quiet in the ranks!

01:45:25.569 --> 01:45:28.738
Shoulder arms!

01:46:04.191 --> 01:46:06.109
Colonel.

01:46:06.819 --> 01:46:08.445
20th Maine to the front.

01:46:11.323 --> 01:46:15.285
Battalion! Shoulder arms!

01:46:15.453 --> 01:46:17.620
Shoulder arms!

01:46:17.788 --> 01:46:20.540
Left face!

01:46:22.376 --> 01:46:24.669
High-file right...

01:46:24.837 --> 01:46:26.713
... march!

01:46:38.184 --> 01:46:43.146
Come on, boys! Show them the cold steel!
Irish brigade, move out!

01:46:43.314 --> 01:46:47.484
Irish brigade, at the double-quick...

01:46:47.651 --> 01:46:51.821
...forward march!

01:46:52.239 --> 01:46:54.824
Front and center!

01:47:02.583 --> 01:47:05.126
Double column, boys! Form up!

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:12.425
Forward!

01:47:30.778 --> 01:47:31.778
Keep moving!

01:47:35.825 --> 01:47:39.828
That's the Irish.
What are those boys doing fighting in blue?

01:47:40.037 --> 01:47:42.580
Don't they know we're fighting
for our independence?

01:47:42.748 --> 01:47:45.458
Did they learn nothing
at the hands of the English?

01:47:45.626 --> 01:47:49.045
They're Reb Irishmen. They're our brothers.

01:47:49.255 --> 01:47:52.006
They've been misled to their fates.

01:48:02.393 --> 01:48:05.061
Do your duty!

01:48:17.408 --> 01:48:21.327
Steady, men! Steady!

01:48:38.012 --> 01:48:40.930
Men, do your duty!

01:48:46.228 --> 01:48:49.230
Battalion, halt!

01:48:53.736 --> 01:48:55.403
Ready!

01:48:55.571 --> 01:48:57.113
Aim!

01:48:57.531 --> 01:48:58.615
Fire!

01:49:13.964 --> 01:49:15.798
Load them up, boys, load them up!

01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:24.515
Ready!

01:49:24.683 --> 01:49:25.767
Aim!

01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:27.310
Fire!

01:49:30.356 --> 01:49:32.482
Load! Load! Load!

01:49:38.989 --> 01:49:40.156
Ready!

01:49:40.324 --> 01:49:41.324
Aim!

01:49:41.492 --> 01:49:43.159
Fire!

01:50:04.348 --> 01:50:06.849
Fall back! Fall back, men!

01:50:07.059 --> 01:50:09.102
Now move! Move!

01:50:14.692 --> 01:50:18.111
Go to hell! Go to hell and damnation!

01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:20.738
Move, boys!

01:50:24.368 --> 01:50:26.828
Lie down here!

01:50:26.996 --> 01:50:41.384
Lie down and load!

01:50:41.969 --> 01:50:43.219
Load!

01:50:46.765 --> 01:50:49.183
Load and fire!

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.352
Quickly!

01:50:51.687 --> 01:50:55.189
Blaze away, lads!
Do it, boys!

01:50:59.611 --> 01:51:00.820
Fire, boys.

01:51:08.912 --> 01:51:12.874
Keep firing, men! Keep firing!

01:51:22.384 --> 01:51:23.426
Fall back!

01:51:24.136 --> 01:51:25.720
Fall back, lads!

01:51:25.888 --> 01:51:28.806
Every man for himself!

01:51:36.023 --> 01:51:38.441
Fall back, men!

01:52:27.699 --> 01:52:30.493
- Caldwell's brigade, forward! Now!
- Yes, sir!

01:52:30.828 --> 01:52:35.206
At the double-quick! March!

01:52:45.884 --> 01:52:49.512
- General Armistead.
- Afternoon, General Pickett.

01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:55.184
- See that last charge by Meagher's brigade?
- Those fellas deserved a better fate.

01:52:55.352 --> 01:52:57.728
Their bravery is worthy of a better cause.

01:52:59.398 --> 01:53:01.315
My heart stood still as I watched it.

01:53:01.483 --> 01:53:03.734
I would not have believed
that mortal men ...

01:53:03.902 --> 01:53:07.029
... could march into the face
of such destruction.

01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:12.285
General Longstreet...

01:53:12.453 --> 01:53:15.913
...those people committing more
fresh divisions at your lines...

01:53:16.206 --> 01:53:20.209
...their mounting numbers
may overwhelm our defense.

01:53:20.669 --> 01:53:25.631
Sir, if they put every man they have
on the field to approach me...

01:53:25.799 --> 01:53:29.886
... give me plenty of ammunition,
I'll kill them all before they reach my line.

01:53:30.888 --> 01:53:33.139
Nevertheless, we must be prudent, general.

01:53:33.307 --> 01:53:36.601
We must never ignore the unknown
or the unpredictable.

01:53:37.811 --> 01:53:40.521
Yes, sir. I'll take the necessary measures.
Orders!

01:53:43.108 --> 01:53:46.569
Send orders to Ransom's Tar Heels
to advance his division ...

01:53:46.737 --> 01:53:50.573
... and to Kershaw to bring up his brigade
to support Cobb at the wall.

01:53:50.741 --> 01:53:52.575
Yes, sir!

01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:17.058
Forward, men!

01:54:39.748 --> 01:54:44.043
Load! Five-second fuse!

01:54:53.804 --> 01:54:56.264
She burst! The barrel burst!

01:54:57.140 --> 01:54:59.475
- Stretcher!
- General Lee, you all right, sir?

01:54:59.643 --> 01:55:05.356
- Sergeant! Call for the surgeon! Quickly!
- Here I go. Help me up, boys.

01:55:14.032 --> 01:55:17.868
It's not yet our time, gentlemen.

01:55:18.036 --> 01:55:19.495
Not yet our time.

01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:35.970
Brigade, halt! Form by battalion!

01:55:36.138 --> 01:55:39.307
Pass them forward.
Just load and pass them forward!

01:56:04.916 --> 01:56:06.375
20th Maine...

01:56:06.877 --> 01:56:08.878
... halt!

01:56:14.051 --> 01:56:17.261
lt is not difficult to move from
line of battle into column of fours.

01:56:17.429 --> 01:56:20.640
lt is much harder to move from
column of fours into line of battle...

01:56:20.807 --> 01:56:24.310
...and if we're called to make that move,
it will be when we are under fire.

01:56:25.062 --> 01:56:29.565
You understand how important it is that
these moves are learned so thoroughly...

01:56:29.733 --> 01:56:32.818
...that the men can perform them
in their sleep.

01:57:01.431 --> 01:57:05.393
Seems a terrible long distance up that hill.

01:57:06.103 --> 01:57:08.270
It'll be shortened by those in the front.

01:57:08.438 --> 01:57:10.231
Begging your pardon, sir.

01:57:10.399 --> 01:57:14.777
The only thing that'll be shortened
by those in front is their lives.

01:57:16.238 --> 01:57:18.531
God help us now.

01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:24.954
- Colonel, take care of the right wing.
- Yes, sir. I'll watch them, sir.

01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:36.716
Hail Caesar.

01:57:36.883 --> 01:57:41.178
We who are about to die salute you.

01:57:48.937 --> 01:57:51.605
20th Maine!

01:57:55.610 --> 01:57:58.320
- Forward!
- Forward!

01:57:58.530 --> 01:58:02.032
- March!
- March!

01:58:02.242 --> 01:58:05.661
By the right of companies,
to the front! March!

01:58:05.829 --> 01:58:09.832
Right of companies to the front! March!

01:58:16.590 --> 01:58:18.674
Form a line, boys! Form a line!

01:58:19.593 --> 01:58:22.678
Form up a line! Form up a line!

01:58:32.022 --> 01:58:33.856
Come on, boys!

01:58:34.024 --> 01:58:35.608
Dress to the colors!

01:58:57.214 --> 01:58:59.298
Come on, boys.

01:59:28.495 --> 01:59:30.746
Dress to the colors!

01:59:48.932 --> 01:59:52.101
Keep your line, men. Keep your line.
Close that gap!

02:00:35.979 --> 02:00:38.898
At the double-quick, men!

02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:46.488
Double-quick, boys! Come on, boys!

02:00:53.246 --> 02:00:55.456
Keep it tight, boys! Keep it tight!

02:00:59.669 --> 02:01:02.504
Turn right, boys! Right!

02:01:02.714 --> 02:01:05.174
Turn to the right!

02:01:07.135 --> 02:01:10.346
Keep it tight, men! Keep it tight, men!

02:01:11.765 --> 02:01:13.349
Come on, boys!

02:01:13.767 --> 02:01:16.852
At the double-quick, boys! Come on, boys!

02:01:18.730 --> 02:01:22.107
Forward, men. Keep moving!

02:01:50.553 --> 02:01:51.845
Battalion, halt!

02:01:52.097 --> 02:01:55.307
- Battalion, halt!
- Battalion, halt!

02:01:55.475 --> 02:01:57.768
Watch your line!

02:01:58.186 --> 02:01:59.895
Dress to the colors!

02:02:01.982 --> 02:02:04.566
Ready! Fire!

02:02:07.028 --> 02:02:11.407
- Reload, boys! Reload quickly!
- Ready! Aim! Fire!

02:02:17.789 --> 02:02:19.581
Keep firing! Keep firing!

02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:25.421
Battalion, fight by fire!

02:02:25.588 --> 02:02:27.881
Thattaway, boys, fire away!

02:02:28.091 --> 02:02:29.258
Pour it into them!

02:02:32.512 --> 02:02:35.431
Close the gap, boys!
Pour it into them!

02:02:35.598 --> 02:02:38.434
Fill this hole now!

02:02:50.488 --> 02:02:54.241
Steady now! Pour it into them!
Dress that line down there!

02:02:54.409 --> 02:02:55.909
- Sir?
- What is it?!

02:02:56.119 --> 02:02:59.997
Request permission to return to the rear, sir.

02:03:02.792 --> 02:03:05.836
Permission granted. Permission granted.

02:03:17.307 --> 02:03:21.685
No, no, Patrick, me boy.
Just reload and shoot.

02:03:38.328 --> 02:03:40.329
Pour it into them, boys!

02:03:42.832 --> 02:03:43.874
Fill that line in!

02:03:46.419 --> 02:03:47.669
Fill this hole now!

02:03:51.174 --> 02:03:52.966
Dress to the right!

02:03:54.844 --> 02:03:57.137
Fire!

02:03:58.598 --> 02:04:01.058
Pour it into them, boys!
Pour it into them!

02:04:02.435 --> 02:04:03.727
Fire!

02:04:09.692 --> 02:04:12.319
- Fall back, men!
- Fall back! Fall back!

02:04:12.487 --> 02:04:13.529
Fall back, boys!

02:05:02.203 --> 02:05:05.706
- What did you do that for?
- You'll thank me in the morning.

02:05:30.732 --> 02:05:33.275
Oh, Mother. Oh, Mother, help me...

02:05:33.443 --> 02:05:38.739
It's all right, Casey, I got you. Don't worry
about a thing. I'll get you home.

02:05:49.167 --> 02:05:52.669
Quickly, men. Reload quickly!

02:06:28.665 --> 02:06:33.502
It is well that war is so terrible...

02:06:33.670 --> 02:06:36.630
...for we should grow too fond of it.

02:06:51.020 --> 02:06:52.145
Yes, sir?

02:06:52.313 --> 02:06:56.400
We're requisitioning your house
for use as a hospital.

02:06:58.361 --> 02:07:01.321
Come on inside out the cold.

02:07:23.428 --> 02:07:25.262
You there.

02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:27.472
You wounded?

02:07:30.018 --> 02:07:32.185
Truly sorry, old fella--

02:07:35.523 --> 02:07:37.357
Damn.

02:08:13.936 --> 02:08:15.937
- General Hancock, sir.
- Surgeon.

02:08:16.105 --> 02:08:19.232
This man is Major Sidney Willard
of the 35th Massachusetts.

02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:21.359
This way, sir.

02:08:34.749 --> 02:08:37.626
Prepare to lift. Lift.

02:08:46.427 --> 02:08:50.972
He's been shot twice in the chest, general.
There's nothing I can do.

02:08:59.607 --> 02:09:03.318
- Is there whiskey in this house?
- Yes, sir.

02:09:10.868 --> 02:09:12.661
Drink this, sir.

02:09:17.708 --> 02:09:20.335
"Think not to thyself...

02:09:20.503 --> 02:09:25.132
...that thou shall escape
in the king's house more than all the Jews.

02:09:26.467 --> 02:09:30.637
For if it thou keepest
thy peace at this time...

02:09:30.805 --> 02:09:35.308
... deliverance shall arise
with the Jews from another place.

02:09:35.685 --> 02:09:39.479
And who knows whether
thou art come to the kingdom ...

02:09:39.647 --> 02:09:42.816
...for such a time as this."

02:09:42.984 --> 02:09:45.652
That's from the book of Esther.

02:09:45.820 --> 02:09:49.781
Esther knew she had to do
more than save herself.

02:09:49.949 --> 02:09:52.492
Esther had to save her people too.

02:09:53.161 --> 02:09:56.663
I love them people
you done chased from this house.

02:09:57.331 --> 02:10:00.959
I's known them most all my life.

02:10:02.461 --> 02:10:05.839
The Beales is good people.

02:10:08.217 --> 02:10:10.844
Mr. General?

02:10:11.929 --> 02:10:14.764
I was born a slave.

02:10:16.267 --> 02:10:19.019
And I wants to die free.

02:10:19.187 --> 02:10:24.357
Lord knows I wants to die free,
and I wants my children to be free.

02:10:25.526 --> 02:10:28.278
Heaven help me.

02:10:30.698 --> 02:10:33.867
May God bless you all.

02:11:20.122 --> 02:11:22.040
Damn it, Tom,
you scared me half to death.

02:11:22.208 --> 02:11:25.919
You?! Lawrence, I thought
you was with the beyond.

02:11:46.274 --> 02:11:47.774
Mother?

02:11:49.944 --> 02:11:52.612
I was able to secure the aid
of a good spyglass...

02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:57.575
... and could ascertain beyond all doubt
that our house is still standing.

02:12:00.788 --> 02:12:04.374
Oh, I pray to God
for Martha and her dear ones.

02:12:04.542 --> 02:12:06.793
But, Mother...

02:12:07.128 --> 02:12:10.338
... it is a pitiful sight on the fields
below Marye's Heights.

02:12:10.506 --> 02:12:13.133
I should feel rancor in my heart
for those invaders...

02:12:13.676 --> 02:12:17.012
... but all I feel for them is sorrow.

02:12:18.931 --> 02:12:20.807
Dear Lucy...

02:12:20.975 --> 02:12:24.144
...when you were
but a child in petticoats...

02:12:24.312 --> 02:12:26.604
... I believe the year was 1 847...

02:12:27.273 --> 02:12:30.567
...there was a great famine in Ireland.

02:12:30.735 --> 02:12:33.111
Those fields below the Heights
were covered ...

02:12:33.279 --> 02:12:36.364
...with the finest crop of corn
ever raised in this section.

02:12:37.116 --> 02:12:40.994
The greater part of it was sent
as a donation to the starving Irish.

02:12:43.331 --> 02:12:45.081
I cannot help thinking ...

02:12:45.249 --> 02:12:48.835
... but that it helped to feed
the poor victims of the Irish brigade...

02:12:49.420 --> 02:12:53.006
...who fell on this very field today.

02:13:15.529 --> 02:13:17.405
General Gregg.

02:13:17.573 --> 02:13:18.990
General Jackson.

02:13:20.451 --> 02:13:23.328
I wish to apologize...

02:13:25.915 --> 02:13:28.416
...for the differences we had.

02:13:29.502 --> 02:13:32.879
The doctor tells me
you have not long to live.

02:13:33.047 --> 02:13:36.257
I ask you to dismiss this matter
from your mind ...

02:13:36.717 --> 02:13:39.677
... and turn your thoughts to God ...

02:13:39.845 --> 02:13:41.721
... and the world to which you go.

02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:44.182
General ...

02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:48.937
...you know that I'm not a believer.

02:13:54.819 --> 02:13:57.946
Well, then I will believe for the both of us.

02:14:18.092 --> 02:14:21.094
How horrible is war.

02:14:23.222 --> 02:14:25.348
Horrible, yes...

02:14:25.516 --> 02:14:28.101
... but we have been invaded.

02:14:28.686 --> 02:14:31.771
Lord, what can we do?

02:14:31.939 --> 02:14:34.357
Kill them, sir.

02:14:36.402 --> 02:14:38.319
Kill every last man of them.

02:14:46.412 --> 02:14:48.079
Gentlemen.

02:15:40.007 --> 02:15:45.011
Oh, what I wouldn't give
for a cup of Rio just now.

02:15:51.852 --> 02:15:55.188
20th Maine! Return fire!

02:15:55.356 --> 02:15:58.566
- Return fire!
- Return fire!

02:16:01.862 --> 02:16:03.696
Patrick.

02:16:05.574 --> 02:16:08.284
I hope you don't mind.

02:16:09.036 --> 02:16:13.915
I know you're in heaven,
but you got work yet to do down here...

02:16:14.083 --> 02:16:15.833
... in this poor pitiless world.

02:16:43.946 --> 02:16:45.362
Colonel Chamberlain.

02:16:45.531 --> 02:16:50.368
Your orders are to withdraw.
Withdraw to the city.

02:18:10.031 --> 02:18:11.324
Colonel.

02:18:11.492 --> 02:18:16.454
We are ordered to form a picket line and
cover the Army's retreat across the river.

02:18:18.665 --> 02:18:20.791
Colonel Chamberlain, did you hear me?

02:18:32.012 --> 02:18:36.974
Yes, sir. We are to retreat, sir.

02:18:42.064 --> 02:18:44.232
Captain Spear.

02:18:45.692 --> 02:18:49.529
- Form the regiment. We're moving out.
- Yes, sir.

02:20:35.677 --> 02:20:37.011
Yankees.

02:20:37.387 --> 02:20:38.638
Everywhere.

02:20:39.556 --> 02:20:44.143
Where y'all been? Can't find my own house.
Gone! Gone!

02:20:45.646 --> 02:20:48.022
What y'all done with my house?

02:20:48.398 --> 02:20:52.068
Where is it? Can y'all tell me that?

02:20:52.444 --> 02:20:57.698
Well, can you? Can you?

02:21:04.164 --> 02:21:06.249
"Men of the Army...

02:21:06.416 --> 02:21:09.418
... although you were not successful
in the recent battle...

02:21:09.586 --> 02:21:14.882
...the attempt was not an error,
nor the failure other than an accident.

02:21:15.634 --> 02:21:20.930
No soldiers in the annals of war
fought more bravely.

02:21:21.223 --> 02:21:24.350
Condoling with the mourners for the dead ...

02:21:24.518 --> 02:21:28.396
... and sympathizing
with the severely wounded ...

02:21:28.564 --> 02:21:32.400
... I congratulate the Army
that the numbers of casualties...

02:21:32.568 --> 02:21:36.863
- ... have been comparatively so small ."
- Compared to what?

02:21:37.030 --> 02:21:39.824
The Scots at Culloden?
The English at Bunker Hill?

02:21:39.992 --> 02:21:41.409
The French at Waterloo?

02:21:41.577 --> 02:21:44.203
"--the thanks of the nation ."

02:21:44.371 --> 02:21:48.708
Signed: Abraham Lincoln.

02:22:04.391 --> 02:22:06.767
Battalion!

02:22:07.060 --> 02:22:09.562
Dismissed!

02:22:19.990 --> 02:22:24.327
At this Christmas season,
when the good fairies are in the air...

02:22:24.494 --> 02:22:27.038
...we can hardly wonder
at the sudden miracle...

02:22:27.205 --> 02:22:31.125
...that has shown us
the Fredericksburg affair in its true light...

02:22:31.293 --> 02:22:36.547
... and given us occasion for national joy
instead of national sorrow.

02:23:43.448 --> 02:23:46.033
General Jackson?

02:23:46.284 --> 02:23:49.245
Do you know
what these decorations signify?

02:23:52.332 --> 02:23:54.875
I was wondering if someone would tell me.

02:23:59.339 --> 02:24:03.134
- This is Santa's sled.
- I see.

02:24:05.512 --> 02:24:09.015
And this is stuff made of candy.

02:24:10.392 --> 02:24:13.728
This is a gingerbread snowflake.

02:24:13.895 --> 02:24:17.732
And this is a paper chain of angels.

02:24:21.862 --> 02:24:24.864
Did you make this angel?

02:24:25.490 --> 02:24:27.283
It's lovely.

02:24:29.953 --> 02:24:33.122
- How old are you, Jane?
- I'm 5 years old.

02:24:33.290 --> 02:24:35.958
- How old are you?
- I'm 38.

02:24:36.126 --> 02:24:40.963
My father is 38. He's a soldier like you.

02:24:41.131 --> 02:24:44.050
I haven't seen him for more than a year.

02:24:45.302 --> 02:24:51.724
I've not met your father, but I'm told
he's a very good man, very brave man.

02:24:52.017 --> 02:24:55.436
I'm sure he misses you
as much as I miss my daughter.

02:24:55.896 --> 02:24:58.981
When did you last see your daughter?

02:25:00.942 --> 02:25:03.360
I've never seen her.

02:25:03.528 --> 02:25:05.988
She was born just days ago.

02:25:06.156 --> 02:25:11.077
I want to see her more than anything
in this world.

02:25:11.328 --> 02:25:16.123
I want to see her as much as
your father wants to see you.

02:25:18.418 --> 02:25:22.421
You see that star at the top of the tree?

02:25:23.173 --> 02:25:25.758
The star of Bethlehem.

02:25:27.219 --> 02:25:31.514
The star that showed the wise men
where they could find the baby Jesus.

02:25:31.932 --> 02:25:37.269
Mother says that star will show Daddy
how to find his way back home.

02:25:41.274 --> 02:25:45.986
Well, your mother's very wise,
very good person.

02:25:46.613 --> 02:25:49.240
Your daddy will come home.

02:25:50.784 --> 02:25:53.661
All the daddies will come home.

02:25:56.873 --> 02:25:59.125
Oh, my.

02:26:17.644 --> 02:26:21.522
Gentlemen, let us lift our glasses
to our Southern women ...

02:26:21.690 --> 02:26:25.151
...without whose bravery and fortitude...

02:26:25.694 --> 02:26:29.488
...without whose love,
without whose endurance and sacrifice...

02:26:29.948 --> 02:26:32.741
... not a man among us
can stay the course...

02:26:35.162 --> 02:26:37.580
... or defend the cause.

02:26:37.914 --> 02:26:40.124
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

02:26:40.292 --> 02:26:41.542
Hear, hear.

02:26:41.710 --> 02:26:45.796
Now it's time for a carol.
Everybody must sing.

02:26:45.964 --> 02:26:49.049
- Carols are my favorite.
- I can't sing.

02:26:49.217 --> 02:26:52.511
Of course you can sing, Mr. Jackson.
You can breathe, can't you?

02:26:52.679 --> 02:26:57.016
Just let your breath flow gently over
your vocal chords and nature does the rest.

02:26:57.184 --> 02:27:01.520
I'm afraid General Jackson's voice is more
suited to the battlefield than the parlor.

02:27:01.688 --> 02:27:04.190
You may take my word on it, Mrs. Corbin.

02:27:04.357 --> 02:27:07.985
If it's singing you want,
my adjutant Mr. Pendleton's your man.

02:27:08.153 --> 02:27:10.279
We've worked our way
through the hymnal ...

02:27:10.447 --> 02:27:13.991
... and he always takes up
where I leave off.

02:27:14.576 --> 02:27:16.619
Well then, Mr. Pendleton ...

02:27:16.786 --> 02:27:20.748
... since the general has appointed you
Kapellmeister...

02:27:20.916 --> 02:27:24.001
...what shall we sing?

02:27:29.049 --> 02:27:31.258
"Silent Night."

02:27:52.489 --> 02:27:54.740
Dearest Fanny:

02:27:54.908 --> 02:28:00.579
The bugle has just sounded,
3rd Brigade extinguish lights.

02:28:01.539 --> 02:28:05.584
It makes me happy to think of you
and my dear little ones at home...

02:28:05.752 --> 02:28:07.419
...all nestled together.

02:28:08.421 --> 02:28:14.593
I know that it is all well and bright with her
whose sweet face shines in my heart.

02:28:16.096 --> 02:28:20.933
Come and let me kiss your dear lips,
precious wife.

02:28:21.601 --> 02:28:26.730
Let our hearts worship together God's love,
and wisdom, and mercy.

02:28:28.733 --> 02:28:33.153
Yes, all is well, well with us, darling...

02:28:34.155 --> 02:28:40.452
...well if we can only meet at last,
as I pray God we may.

02:29:44.559 --> 02:29:47.686
Hey, Billy Yank.

02:29:52.025 --> 02:29:56.320
- That's a mighty nice song.
- I'm pleased you find it so agreeable.

02:29:56.613 --> 02:30:00.783
I'd like it even more if I had some coffee
to wash it down.

02:30:00.950 --> 02:30:04.328
- Want some baccy?
- Sure, Johnny.

02:30:04.537 --> 02:30:07.081
Have you got a lame horse?

02:30:08.083 --> 02:30:10.959
What do you be wanting to trade
for a lame horse?

02:30:11.127 --> 02:30:12.961
Would you take General Burnside?

02:30:14.631 --> 02:30:19.259
No. I guess I'll keep the horsehide.

02:30:20.053 --> 02:30:22.137
Come on, get your baccy.

02:31:57.734 --> 02:32:02.821
Mr. Smith, are you aware that the Bible
gives models of official battle reports?

02:32:02.989 --> 02:32:06.492
- No, sir.
- Nevertheless, there are such.

02:32:06.659 --> 02:32:10.996
Consider the narrative of Joshua's battles
with the Amalekites.

02:32:11.164 --> 02:32:13.832
It has clearness and modesty, brevity.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:19.004
And it traces the victory to the right source,
the blessing of God.

02:32:20.673 --> 02:32:23.550
Has it helped you with your reports, sir?

02:32:23.718 --> 02:32:26.345
Anybody home?

02:32:28.389 --> 02:32:32.017
Afternoon, General Jackson.

02:32:37.357 --> 02:32:39.274
What's this?

02:32:49.369 --> 02:32:52.621
- New recruits.
- My mama helped me make these.

02:32:54.123 --> 02:32:56.208
That's fine.

02:33:00.505 --> 02:33:04.925
- Left, right. Left, right.
- Child, that hat is a bit too large for you.

02:33:05.218 --> 02:33:07.094
However...

02:33:26.573 --> 02:33:27.864
...there.

02:33:28.074 --> 02:33:31.368
I believe that suits a young girl
better than an old soldier.

02:33:33.788 --> 02:33:35.831
Mama's baking some biscuits.

02:33:35.999 --> 02:33:40.586
You know, I was thinking of walking over
to the big house for a nice hot cup of tea.

02:33:40.837 --> 02:33:45.257
And I would very much like the company
of one beautiful little lady.

02:33:45.425 --> 02:33:50.095
Yes, General Jackson,
a hot cup of chamomile.

02:33:56.436 --> 02:34:02.649
Mr. Smith, you may continue
writing the reports.

02:34:04.152 --> 02:34:08.655
Consult first and second Samuel ...

02:34:09.073 --> 02:34:11.283
... and first and second Kings.

02:34:11.451 --> 02:34:13.785
They will be of help to you.

02:34:13.953 --> 02:34:15.495
Shall we go?

02:34:15.663 --> 02:34:19.124
Do you prefer butter biscuits
or sugar cookies?

02:34:19.292 --> 02:34:24.087
Oh, my. I know your mother's biscuits
are first-rate.

02:34:58.164 --> 02:35:01.625
We owe you Texas boys a debt of gratitude
for putting on these shows.

02:35:01.793 --> 02:35:05.087
Colonel Patton, any man who can't handle
a guitar or a fiddle...

02:35:05.254 --> 02:35:07.881
... ain't fit to carry a musket.

02:36:18.828 --> 02:36:22.456
Attention, battalions.

02:36:25.042 --> 02:36:26.752
Halt.

02:36:27.378 --> 02:36:30.005
- Sergeant, keep these men here for now.
- Yes, sir.

02:36:39.599 --> 02:36:41.349
Sir.

02:36:43.227 --> 02:36:45.395
The men have rounded up three deserters.

02:36:47.106 --> 02:36:49.775
Establish the courts-martial.

02:36:49.942 --> 02:36:53.361
Have them arraigned.
See they're given a fair hearing.

02:36:54.489 --> 02:36:56.406
Yes, sir.

02:37:01.245 --> 02:37:02.871
Yes?

02:37:03.790 --> 02:37:06.958
Well, I thought that you should know, sir.

02:37:09.045 --> 02:37:11.922
They all belong to the Stonewall brigade.

02:37:24.185 --> 02:37:25.811
Do your duty, soldier.

02:37:27.188 --> 02:37:28.855
Yes, sir.

02:37:29.023 --> 02:37:31.983
Mr. Pendleton, if they are innocent,
these men will go free.

02:37:32.401 --> 02:37:35.070
But if they are found guilty of desertion ...

02:37:35.238 --> 02:37:38.990
...the courts-martial condemns them
to death. It must be so.

02:37:45.623 --> 02:37:47.374
Yes, sir.

02:37:48.084 --> 02:37:49.751
Of course, sir.

02:37:49.919 --> 02:37:51.962
I'm not done yet.

02:37:57.677 --> 02:37:59.094
Sandie.

02:38:07.812 --> 02:38:13.984
If the Republicans lose their little war,
they are voted out in the next election ...

02:38:14.151 --> 02:38:18.405
... and they return to their homes
in New York or Massachusetts or Illinois...

02:38:18.573 --> 02:38:20.907
...fat with their war profits.

02:38:22.326 --> 02:38:27.539
If we lose, we lose our country.

02:38:28.583 --> 02:38:31.042
We lose our independence.

02:38:32.795 --> 02:38:35.714
We lose it all.

02:38:42.930 --> 02:38:45.473
Our soldiers are brave.

02:38:46.142 --> 02:38:49.978
They have endured hardships none of them
could ever have imagined.

02:38:50.146 --> 02:38:53.315
Desertion is not a solitary crime.

02:38:54.567 --> 02:38:57.569
It's a crime against the tens of thousands
of veterans...

02:38:57.737 --> 02:39:00.822
...who are huddled together
in the harsh cold of this winter.

02:39:00.990 --> 02:39:04.326
Against all those who have sacrificed.

02:39:05.161 --> 02:39:08.163
Against all those who have fallen.

02:39:08.372 --> 02:39:13.585
Against all the women and the children
we have left alone to fend for themselves.

02:39:14.629 --> 02:39:19.341
I regard the crime of desertion as a sin
against the Army of the Lord.

02:39:25.139 --> 02:39:26.806
Duty is ours.

02:39:28.059 --> 02:39:30.727
The consequences are God's.

02:39:55.628 --> 02:39:58.672
I am a soldier in the 4th Virginia.

02:39:58.965 --> 02:40:02.300
And in the 4th Virginia I will stay.

02:40:02.468 --> 02:40:04.803
And if needs be, die.

02:40:15.147 --> 02:40:17.816
The courts-martial of the Army
of Northern Virginia...

02:40:17.984 --> 02:40:21.528
... has found you guilty of desertion
and sentences you to death ...

02:40:21.696 --> 02:40:23.905
... by firing squad.

02:40:24.156 --> 02:40:27.033
Lieutenant, do your duty.

02:40:29.161 --> 02:40:31.413
Detail, ready!

02:40:32.373 --> 02:40:34.332
Aim.

02:40:34.500 --> 02:40:36.376
Fire!

02:40:37.378 --> 02:40:40.338
Recover, arm!

02:40:57.023 --> 02:40:59.107
Morning, Lawrence.

02:40:59.316 --> 02:41:00.859
- Any mail?
- No.

02:41:01.027 --> 02:41:03.945
But I did manage to get my hands
on a New York Tribune.

02:41:04.113 --> 02:41:08.533
- What are they saying about us now?
- Well, not much about us.

02:41:08.701 --> 02:41:11.953
I mean, that is, this Army here
in Stoneman's Switch.

02:41:12.121 --> 02:41:16.207
Sure are kicking up a fuss
about Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.

02:41:16.876 --> 02:41:20.462
Says here that enlistments are down
and desertions are up.

02:41:20.629 --> 02:41:24.215
- Any grumbling among the men?
- Well, not in our regiment.

02:41:24.383 --> 02:41:28.428
A few wonder out loud why they should be
risking their lives for the darkies.

02:41:28.596 --> 02:41:31.222
Well, Tom, you know my position.

02:41:31.390 --> 02:41:34.934
I signed up to preserve the Union.
The president did the right thing.

02:41:35.102 --> 02:41:40.607
What's the use of uniting the country
by force and leaving slavery in place?

02:41:41.108 --> 02:41:43.401
It sure riled up those Johnny Rebs.

02:41:43.569 --> 02:41:46.738
They'll think Lincoln incited the slaves
to rise against them.

02:41:46.906 --> 02:41:48.448
Why shouldn't they?

02:41:48.616 --> 02:41:52.243
Freeing the slaves wasn't a war aim
when this began, but war changes things.

02:41:52.411 --> 02:41:55.163
- It sorts things out.
- Well, I don't know, Lawrence.

02:41:55.331 --> 02:41:58.208
Not everybody feels the way we do
about the darkies.

02:41:58.375 --> 02:42:01.086
Especially when it comes to fighting
and dying.

02:42:01.253 --> 02:42:02.879
Tom.

02:42:03.214 --> 02:42:04.506
Do me a favor.

02:42:05.132 --> 02:42:10.095
Don't call me Lawrence
and don't call Negroes "darkies."

02:42:10.262 --> 02:42:14.057
That's a patronizing expression
from which we must free ourselves.

02:42:18.270 --> 02:42:23.441
Come outside. I want to--
I want to show you something.

02:42:45.422 --> 02:42:47.924
All these thousands of men.

02:42:48.092 --> 02:42:50.885
Many of them not much more than boys.

02:42:51.053 --> 02:42:53.388
Each one of them some mother's son.

02:42:53.556 --> 02:42:57.809
Some sister's brother.
Some daughter's father.

02:42:58.227 --> 02:43:04.190
Each one of them a whole person,
loved and cherished in some home far away.

02:43:05.025 --> 02:43:07.819
Many of them will never return.

02:43:11.198 --> 02:43:13.992
An army is power.

02:43:14.952 --> 02:43:18.830
Its entire purpose is to coerce others.

02:43:19.540 --> 02:43:23.668
Now, this kind of power cannot be used
carelessly or recklessly.

02:43:24.003 --> 02:43:26.671
This kind of power can do great harm.

02:43:29.300 --> 02:43:33.803
We have seen more suffering
than any man should ever see...

02:43:33.971 --> 02:43:40.101
... and if there is going to be an end to it,
it must be an end that justifies the cost.

02:43:41.395 --> 02:43:46.900
Now, somewhere out there
is the Confederate Army.

02:43:47.234 --> 02:43:51.529
They claim they are fighting
for their independence, for their freedom.

02:43:51.697 --> 02:43:54.532
Now, I cannot question their integrity.

02:43:54.700 --> 02:43:58.203
I believe they are wrong,
but I cannot question it.

02:43:58.704 --> 02:44:03.333
But I do question a system that defends
its own freedom while it denies it to others.

02:44:03.500 --> 02:44:05.835
To an entire race of men.

02:44:07.004 --> 02:44:11.549
I will admit it, Tom, war is a scourge.
But so is slavery.

02:44:11.759 --> 02:44:17.722
It is the systematic coercion
of one group of men over another.

02:44:17.890 --> 02:44:21.059
It has been around since
the book of Genesis.

02:44:21.227 --> 02:44:24.604
It exists in every corner of the world.

02:44:24.772 --> 02:44:27.232
But that's no excuse for us
to tolerate it here...

02:44:27.399 --> 02:44:32.195
...when we find it right before
our very eyes, in our own country.

02:44:37.409 --> 02:44:42.330
As God is my witness, there is no one
I hold in my heart dearer than you.

02:44:44.667 --> 02:44:51.089
But if your life or mine is part of the price
to end this curse and free the Negro...

02:44:53.759 --> 02:44:55.885
...then let God's will be done.

02:45:37.052 --> 02:45:39.762
Oh, my, general, we do appreciate the gift.

02:45:40.139 --> 02:45:43.016
Where do you get all these lemons?

02:45:43.183 --> 02:45:46.144
It's a kind providence that provides kindly.

02:45:46.312 --> 02:45:49.814
Miss Corbin, the Yankees have not
succeeded in cutting our rail lines...

02:45:49.982 --> 02:45:51.232
...to the South.

02:45:52.192 --> 02:45:57.697
Here is to the sultry, balmy South.

02:45:57.865 --> 02:46:00.616
And, Miss Corbin,
here's to your engagement.

02:46:01.035 --> 02:46:06.080
May Sandie Pendleton prove to be
as fine a husband as he is a soldier.

02:46:07.374 --> 02:46:09.292
Hear, hear.

02:46:22.348 --> 02:46:24.515
That's good, it's not too sweet.

02:46:24.683 --> 02:46:26.267
May I have some more?

02:46:26.435 --> 02:46:28.353
Sure.

02:47:06.725 --> 02:47:08.726
Mrs. Corbin.

02:47:08.894 --> 02:47:11.437
Thank you for your many kindnesses.

02:47:11.605 --> 02:47:15.441
Our cause and our country are in your debt.

02:47:15.609 --> 02:47:18.277
I only regret, general,
that we could not do more.

02:47:18.445 --> 02:47:22.240
You'll come visit us again
when this cruel war is over?

02:47:22.408 --> 02:47:26.327
I should like to say goodbye to your
daughter. I shall miss her very much.

02:47:26.495 --> 02:47:29.414
Certainly, general.
She's not feeling very well today.

02:47:29.581 --> 02:47:34.085
All of the children have come down
with the fever. Please, come in.

02:47:42.261 --> 02:47:44.262
Well, now.

02:47:46.473 --> 02:47:48.349
What's this?

02:47:52.563 --> 02:47:57.108
How can I play with my friend
if she insists on staying in bed?

02:48:15.210 --> 02:48:16.961
Jane.

02:48:17.421 --> 02:48:21.466
Will you place this angel on your tree
next Christmas?

02:48:43.530 --> 02:48:46.532
Mrs. Corbin, I must return to my men.

02:48:46.700 --> 02:48:49.160
My physician, Doctor McGuire,
will attend to her.

02:48:49.328 --> 02:48:53.623
- I will send him directly.
- Bless you, general.

02:49:04.468 --> 02:49:06.886
Fresh meat. What a change.

02:49:07.054 --> 02:49:11.641
Yeah. A live steer around these parts
is as rare as a peacock in a poultry pen.

02:49:25.072 --> 02:49:27.406
It was scarlet fever.

02:49:29.159 --> 02:49:32.411
The children are all right. They'll be fine.
Except--

02:49:34.915 --> 02:49:37.166
I'm so sorry, sir.

02:49:37.793 --> 02:49:39.919
The little girl, Jane.

02:49:40.087 --> 02:49:44.715
She did not survive. She died, sir.

02:51:01.209 --> 02:51:03.002
What is it?

02:51:04.880 --> 02:51:06.589
He's never cried before.

02:51:07.591 --> 02:51:12.303
Not for all the blood and all the death,
not for his young students from VMI ...

02:51:12.804 --> 02:51:15.181
... not for his friends...

02:51:16.642 --> 02:51:18.643
... not for anyone.

02:51:19.645 --> 02:51:21.979
Not so, Sandie.

02:51:23.398 --> 02:51:26.942
I think he is crying for them all.

02:53:09.171 --> 02:53:12.381
She's too pretty to look like me.

02:53:12.674 --> 02:53:16.135
Nonsense, Thomas.

02:53:16.428 --> 02:53:19.388
She is very like you.

02:53:21.391 --> 02:53:26.854
She rises early and she loves
to be held in my arms.

02:53:34.321 --> 02:53:38.115
I have never seen you look so well, Thomas.

02:53:39.409 --> 02:53:42.411
You are handsomer than ever.

02:53:51.797 --> 02:53:54.799
General Jackson, sir? General Jackson, sir?

02:53:54.966 --> 02:54:00.304
An officer come to see you, sir.
An officer from General Lee, sir.

02:54:01.848 --> 02:54:04.225
I'll be right there.

02:54:41.429 --> 02:54:46.016
General, from what we've observed, Hooker
has moved five corps, maybe 70, 000 men.

02:54:46.184 --> 02:54:48.644
They're digging in around
Chancellor's mansion.

02:54:48.812 --> 02:54:53.691
Sedgwick has another 40, 000
spread out along the Stafford Heights...

02:54:53.859 --> 02:54:58.153
... on the north bank of the Rappahannock
in front of General Early at Fredericksburg.

02:54:58.321 --> 02:55:02.783
Now, there's possibly 30, 000 more
back along the river north of here...

02:55:02.951 --> 02:55:04.577
...that we've not yet located.

02:55:05.829 --> 02:55:07.955
We're not in a position of strength here.

02:55:08.123 --> 02:55:11.834
We owe a great deal to the unexplainable,
the mystery of General Hooker...

02:55:12.002 --> 02:55:14.378
...who's allowed us to maneuver freely...

02:55:14.546 --> 02:55:19.925
... between two parts of an army
that's more than twice our strength.

02:55:20.510 --> 02:55:23.971
We do not yet understand his plan.

02:55:24.139 --> 02:55:26.432
He may still plan a move
toward Gordonsville...

02:55:26.600 --> 02:55:28.934
... move around below us,
cut us off from Richmond.

02:55:29.227 --> 02:55:31.729
And there's still Sedgwick on the river.

02:55:32.063 --> 02:55:36.442
Now Sedgwick shows no signs of moving,
but that could change.

02:55:36.818 --> 02:55:41.822
They're anchored against the river and their
lines continue down below Chancellorsville...

02:55:41.990 --> 02:55:44.325
...then curves along here.

02:55:44.534 --> 02:55:47.912
We've observed their lines curving out
in these open clearings...

02:55:48.079 --> 02:55:51.081
...then extending on out to the west.

02:55:51.249 --> 02:55:54.835
Then what, general?
Do you know where their right flank is?

02:55:55.003 --> 02:55:58.339
- No. Not yet.
- We must know. We must know.

02:55:58.506 --> 02:56:02.009
If he marches in that direction,
he could threaten our flank...

02:56:02.177 --> 02:56:06.513
... or be going toward Gordonsville
before we can react.

02:56:07.182 --> 02:56:09.308
General Lee, sir.

02:56:09.476 --> 02:56:12.436
- May I approach?
- Sure.

02:56:15.899 --> 02:56:18.484
Out here, in the west,
along this turnpike, here...

02:56:18.652 --> 02:56:23.405
...their right flank's in the air.
It's the one place they're not digging in.

02:56:23.573 --> 02:56:25.950
They're not expecting any pressure there.

02:56:26.451 --> 02:56:31.455
- Who's on their flank?
- 1 1 th Corps. Oliver Howard.

02:56:32.499 --> 02:56:35.793
Were there any roads farther down
below the turnpike?

02:56:35.961 --> 02:56:38.754
Yes, sir. Indeed there are, good roads.

02:56:38.922 --> 02:56:42.299
That's Catherine's Furnace here
and there's a road here.

02:56:42.467 --> 02:56:45.761
- There's a road over this way.
- Then, we must hit them there.

02:56:45.929 --> 02:56:49.223
Then attack the flank.
They will have nowhere to go.

02:56:49.391 --> 02:56:53.143
They'll have to go back across the river
or we will destroy them.

02:56:53.311 --> 02:56:56.897
We're too close to their lines.
They'll observe our movements.

02:56:57.065 --> 02:56:59.400
There must be another road farther down.

02:57:00.193 --> 02:57:02.403
Now, is there someone we know?

02:57:02.570 --> 02:57:05.489
Someone we can trust who knows the area?

02:57:05.949 --> 02:57:08.325
Captain Pendleton.
Find Reverend Lacy for me.

02:57:08.493 --> 02:57:10.536
I'm here, sir.

02:57:10.704 --> 02:57:12.997
This is my chaplain,
the Reverend Tucker Lacy.

02:57:13.164 --> 02:57:15.207
He has family in this area.

02:57:15.375 --> 02:57:17.459
General Lee.

02:57:18.586 --> 02:57:22.172
Reverend, it would be very helpful
if you could find us a safe route...

02:57:22.340 --> 02:57:26.802
- ... around the enemy.
- Well, sir, there, I know a family.

02:57:26.970 --> 02:57:31.515
The Wellfords. I suggest a visit to them.
We may find ourselves a guide.

02:57:31.683 --> 02:57:36.186
Please go at once, Mr. Lacy. Find someone
who might show us how we might proceed.

02:57:36.354 --> 02:57:38.063
Yes, sir.

02:57:40.150 --> 02:57:44.903
Then it has been decided, general.
This mission will be yours.

02:57:47.365 --> 02:57:49.867
I would not have it any other way.

02:57:52.370 --> 02:57:54.663
Boys, my days are numbered.

02:57:55.582 --> 02:57:57.416
My time has come.

02:57:58.835 --> 02:58:03.630
You can laugh, but my time has come.

02:58:06.593 --> 02:58:10.596
I got a 20-dollar gold piece I carried
through the war and a silver watch ...

02:58:10.764 --> 02:58:13.307
... my daddy sent to me
through the lines.

02:58:17.103 --> 02:58:19.396
Take them off of me when I'm dead.

02:58:20.774 --> 02:58:24.401
Give them to my captain to give to my
daddy when he gets back home.

02:58:24.569 --> 02:58:28.113
Here's my clothes and my blanket.
Anybody who wishes can have them.

02:58:29.824 --> 02:58:35.621
My rations I do not wish at all. My gun
and cartridge box I expect to die with.

02:58:46.216 --> 02:58:47.758
- Mr. Smith.
- Sir.

02:58:47.926 --> 02:58:51.929
Your instructions to the ranks: There is
to be no noise, I want no talking.

02:58:52.097 --> 02:58:54.640
Stragglers will be bayoneted,
let the men know.

02:58:54.808 --> 02:58:59.269
No muskets are to be loaded until we
deploy for battle. Secrecy, Mr. Smith.

02:58:59.437 --> 02:59:02.022
Everything depends upon
the element of surprise.

02:59:02.190 --> 02:59:06.026
Sir, I'll convey the orders. No stragglers.

02:59:10.323 --> 02:59:13.534
- Reverend.
- May we bow our heads.

02:59:15.286 --> 02:59:20.040
Dear Lord, heavenly Father,
you who know all things.

02:59:20.208 --> 02:59:23.669
We face again a mighty
foe, a vast host.

02:59:24.129 --> 02:59:27.047
An enemy more than twice our number.

02:59:27.215 --> 02:59:31.802
But you have taught us
to fear not, to trust in you.

02:59:32.137 --> 02:59:37.141
When the Philistines came before them,
the people of Israel feared Goliath.

02:59:37.308 --> 02:59:39.143
Their Army was in terror.

02:59:39.310 --> 02:59:43.272
No one had the courage to stand
against the mighty warrior.

02:59:43.439 --> 02:59:47.484
Then you brought forth David,
a mere boy.

02:59:47.652 --> 02:59:50.612
And Saul armed David with his armor...

02:59:50.780 --> 02:59:54.783
...and he put a helmet
of brass upon his head.

02:59:54.951 --> 02:59:58.162
Also he armed him with a coat of mail.

02:59:58.329 --> 03:00:04.585
And David girded his sword upon
his armor and he assayed to go.

03:00:30.069 --> 03:00:35.032
General Rodes, deploy your men on
either side of the turnpike, brigade front.

03:00:35.200 --> 03:00:37.451
How soon will
General Colston's men be up?

03:00:37.619 --> 03:00:39.745
We're right behind, general.

03:00:44.626 --> 03:00:46.043
General Lee...

03:00:47.587 --> 03:00:50.589
... I hope as soon as
practicable to attack...

03:00:50.757 --> 03:00:56.053
... I trust that an ever kind providence
will bless us with great success.

03:01:00.350 --> 03:01:02.643
Take this to General Lee.

03:01:05.605 --> 03:01:08.607
Well, General Rodes...

03:01:10.777 --> 03:01:15.030
... it appears the Virginia Military
Institute will be heard from today.

03:01:16.241 --> 03:01:18.116
Deploy your brigade.

03:01:40.556 --> 03:01:45.018
There is another road. It's a road that
runs well below the Federal lines.

03:01:45.186 --> 03:01:48.313
The Wellford boy explained it to me.
He knows the route.

03:01:48.481 --> 03:01:51.858
He will march with us to where
this road rejoins the turnpike...

03:01:52.026 --> 03:01:54.987
...then we turn to the east
and attack their right flank.

03:01:55.154 --> 03:01:58.991
It is a greater distance, perhaps 1 2 or
1 3 miles, but the boys can do it.

03:01:59.158 --> 03:02:01.326
They have never let us down.

03:02:01.828 --> 03:02:04.788
We've divided the Army before.

03:02:06.291 --> 03:02:10.794
We must retain the advantage of
surprise, we must outflank the flankers.

03:02:10.962 --> 03:02:14.381
We must beat them at their own game.

03:02:16.843 --> 03:02:23.307
Take your entire corps,
General Jackson, and destroy the enemy.

03:02:24.726 --> 03:02:26.810
God be with you.

03:03:33.878 --> 03:03:38.382
Two hours of daylight left.
Are you ready, General Rodes?

03:03:38.841 --> 03:03:40.801
You may move forward.

03:06:07.031 --> 03:06:11.076
- Fall back!
- They're coming! Get your muskets!

03:06:30.054 --> 03:06:33.598
- Shoulder to shoulder! Let's go, let's go!
- Fall back!

03:06:34.684 --> 03:06:37.102
Aim fire!

03:06:37.270 --> 03:06:38.728
Pull back and save yourself!

03:07:08.801 --> 03:07:11.261
Form a line! Aim!

03:07:11.596 --> 03:07:12.929
Fire!

03:07:15.224 --> 03:07:18.935
Fall back!

03:07:19.103 --> 03:07:21.605
Fire! Fall back!

03:07:21.939 --> 03:07:25.400
Into the trees, men! Fall back!

03:07:27.278 --> 03:07:28.945
Press on!

03:07:59.185 --> 03:08:01.770
Form a line! Form a line!

03:08:01.937 --> 03:08:03.647
Form a line!

03:08:04.315 --> 03:08:05.899
- Run! Run!
- Charge!

03:08:50.444 --> 03:08:52.070
Press on!

03:08:58.369 --> 03:09:02.831
Hold up right here! Aim! Fire!

03:09:34.530 --> 03:09:39.159
Push on!

03:10:44.099 --> 03:10:47.560
Hell, that's hot. I knew
you'd be all right, you dang fool.

03:10:54.568 --> 03:10:55.819
Oh, God.

03:11:11.544 --> 03:11:12.961
Regroup!

03:11:13.462 --> 03:11:16.339
- Stop running!
- Move into line!

03:11:16.507 --> 03:11:18.174
Stay together!

03:11:18.717 --> 03:11:21.427
My God! Give them the bayonet!

03:11:23.597 --> 03:11:26.057
- Stop running!
- Stop running!

03:11:26.225 --> 03:11:28.268
Stop running, soldier!

03:11:28.435 --> 03:11:33.106
Stop running! Rally with me, men!

03:11:34.441 --> 03:11:38.444
- Rally with me!
- Stop! Rally around the general!

03:11:38.612 --> 03:11:42.031
Give me a line to the left!
Form a line to the left!

03:11:43.200 --> 03:11:46.911
We have stopped, sir. Can't see.
The lines are tangled.

03:11:47.079 --> 03:11:50.415
We're mixed in with Rodes' men.
It's confusion, sir.

03:11:50.583 --> 03:11:53.501
We need Hill to come up.
Hill's men can move on by us.

03:11:53.669 --> 03:11:56.170
Tell General Colston
he must re-form his men.

03:11:56.338 --> 03:12:00.133
Now I will strongly urge General Hill
to push forward hard.

03:12:00.301 --> 03:12:05.305
We must not stop. Let General Colston
know they will run if we press them.

03:12:05.472 --> 03:12:07.223
Yes, sir.

03:12:07.892 --> 03:12:12.186
General Hill, you must keep the men
moving. We must keep the pressure up.

03:12:12.354 --> 03:12:16.232
We have broken their flank. We can
crush them now if we can cut them off.

03:12:16.400 --> 03:12:18.818
We must not give them time
to get organized.

03:12:18.986 --> 03:12:21.237
General, take your division forward.

03:12:21.405 --> 03:12:25.199
Press on north, move toward the river,
toward the United States ford.

03:12:25.367 --> 03:12:28.745
- We must not let them escape.
- It's late in the day, general.

03:12:28.913 --> 03:12:31.748
- We don't know the ground.
- Boswell!

03:12:31.916 --> 03:12:36.753
You will ride with General Hill. You will find
a way through the woods to the northeast.

03:12:36.921 --> 03:12:39.589
You will find the rear
of the enemy's position.

03:12:39.757 --> 03:12:41.341
Yes, sir.

03:12:41.508 --> 03:12:44.052
We will cut them off, general!

03:13:30.933 --> 03:13:34.060
They're digging in. Must be Federal.

03:13:37.356 --> 03:13:40.858
Sound carries at night,
they could be a ways off.

03:13:45.155 --> 03:13:49.701
General, sir, we are beyond our lines.
This is no place for you, sir.

03:13:53.747 --> 03:13:55.248
You're right.

03:13:58.877 --> 03:14:01.504
It cannot go the way I'd hoped.

03:14:03.382 --> 03:14:05.591
It will have to be tomorrow.

03:14:08.345 --> 03:14:10.972
Gentlemen, let us return to the road.

03:14:34.538 --> 03:14:36.831
Stop firing! You're firing
at your own men!

03:14:37.833 --> 03:14:39.083
Hold it!

03:14:41.003 --> 03:14:43.546
Hold your fire!
These are your own men here!

03:14:44.006 --> 03:14:46.466
It's a lie! Pour into them, boys!

03:14:49.053 --> 03:14:51.637
Cease fire! Cease fire!

03:14:52.097 --> 03:14:55.308
General Hill, they're our men!

03:15:01.440 --> 03:15:03.399
What have they done?

03:15:07.446 --> 03:15:08.905
Who is this?

03:15:10.908 --> 03:15:14.410
Oh, God, general! Are you hurt badly?

03:15:14.578 --> 03:15:18.081
I'm afraid I am, in my shoulder.

03:15:18.749 --> 03:15:21.959
And here.

03:15:23.045 --> 03:15:27.590
- Get a litter. We need a litter. Move!
- Yes, sir.

03:15:28.092 --> 03:15:32.720
- We must leave here, general.
- Here, take this. It'll help, sir.

03:15:38.435 --> 03:15:41.646
I will try to keep this from
the knowledge of the troops.

03:15:41.814 --> 03:15:44.565
Thank you, general.

03:15:46.193 --> 03:15:50.905
The Yankees have set up a battery not a
hundred yards. We must get away!

03:15:57.788 --> 03:16:01.624
Ready? Lift! Careful now.

03:16:04.419 --> 03:16:07.004
Move out. Ready, lift.

03:16:29.027 --> 03:16:37.034
Fire!

03:16:39.663 --> 03:16:44.792
General. Lie quiet, or you
will most certainly be killed.

03:16:58.557 --> 03:16:59.640
Let's go. Lift!

03:17:02.853 --> 03:17:05.730
Move! Ready? Lift!

03:17:25.209 --> 03:17:29.378
Doctor, good to see you.

03:17:31.048 --> 03:17:35.009
I am hurt badly.

03:17:36.136 --> 03:17:40.056
I fear I am dying.

03:17:43.143 --> 03:17:47.230
Sir, I want you to drink this.

03:17:48.565 --> 03:17:51.025
It's whiskey and morphine.

03:17:56.490 --> 03:18:02.119
Your right hand is minor.
The ball lodged under the skin.

03:18:03.538 --> 03:18:05.539
It's these other wounds.

03:18:07.417 --> 03:18:10.753
I need to examine your arm.

03:18:10.921 --> 03:18:15.007
And I'll administer chloroform
to make it painless.

03:18:16.093 --> 03:18:20.763
If I should find that the condition
warrants amputation ...

03:18:21.265 --> 03:18:23.766
... may I proceed at once?

03:18:27.396 --> 03:18:31.857
I have complete faith
in you, Dr. McGuire.

03:18:33.110 --> 03:18:37.196
Just do to me whatever
you think necessary.

03:18:46.915 --> 03:18:49.292
Breathe deeply, general.

03:18:56.633 --> 03:18:59.552
What an infinite blessing.

03:19:09.146 --> 03:19:11.355
Blessing.

03:19:37.132 --> 03:19:41.010
Doesn't seem right that General Jackson
isn't here to see this.

03:19:41.511 --> 03:19:47.808
No, major. It does not seem right at all.
But it is the will of God.

03:19:49.853 --> 03:19:55.024
He's lost his left arm. I've lost my right.

03:20:19.549 --> 03:20:20.925
General?

03:20:23.387 --> 03:20:25.262
How you feeling, sir?

03:20:26.014 --> 03:20:29.642
Do not concern yourself about me.

03:20:30.227 --> 03:20:33.479
But tell me, how are we faring?

03:20:33.647 --> 03:20:37.900
General, the enemy's gone
across the river.

03:20:38.068 --> 03:20:41.362
We secured the high ground
around Chancellorsville.

03:20:41.738 --> 03:20:44.532
General Stuart did well by you, sir.

03:20:45.826 --> 03:20:48.077
And the Stonewall brigade...

03:20:50.872 --> 03:20:56.043
... right in the middle of it, sir.
"Remember Jackson, " they shouted.

03:20:56.461 --> 03:20:58.587
I heard that all day.

03:20:59.798 --> 03:21:02.425
They were fighting for Stonewall.

03:21:07.264 --> 03:21:12.935
Well, isn't that just like them.
They are a noble set of men.

03:21:13.603 --> 03:21:17.982
That name, Stonewall, belongs
to the brigade, not to me.

03:21:19.693 --> 03:21:21.485
I have the ball.

03:21:24.114 --> 03:21:28.909
Dr. McGuire allowed me to keep the
musket ball he took from your hand.

03:21:31.371 --> 03:21:36.709
It was a round, smooth bore.
It had to be one of ours.

03:21:37.294 --> 03:21:42.006
I heard. They thought I was asleep.

03:21:43.133 --> 03:21:47.761
It could not be helped.
There's no blame in war.

03:21:49.431 --> 03:21:51.682
We must all forgive.

03:21:59.566 --> 03:22:05.863
I had to remove your husband's
left arm, patch his right hand.

03:22:06.490 --> 03:22:10.284
He's healing well, I'm very pleased.
But there is a new problem.

03:22:10.452 --> 03:22:13.412
I do believe he is developing pneumonia.

03:22:13.580 --> 03:22:17.583
- May I see him, doctor?
- Well, certainly, certainly. He's weak.

03:22:17.751 --> 03:22:21.253
I've given him some medicine
to help him sleep.

03:22:21.421 --> 03:22:27.551
He's in some pain and the medication
makes him drift away. He's in and out.

03:22:43.735 --> 03:22:49.657
General, I have a treat for you.
Something you may have been missing.

03:22:49.991 --> 03:22:52.993
Another medicine?

03:22:55.330 --> 03:22:57.456
Very well, doctor.

03:22:57.958 --> 03:23:02.378
No, it's not mine, actually.

03:23:02.546 --> 03:23:06.549
But it may do you some good.

03:23:15.308 --> 03:23:19.562
Oh, so sweet. Too much sugar.

03:23:19.729 --> 03:23:24.275
Always the problem with
my esposita's lemonade.

03:23:46.047 --> 03:23:52.386
I'm so glad to see you looking so bright.

03:23:56.474 --> 03:24:00.144
No, no. You must be cheerful.

03:24:02.272 --> 03:24:03.772
Let's not have a long face.

03:24:03.940 --> 03:24:09.278
You know I like cheerfulness
and brightness in a sickroom.

03:24:15.869 --> 03:24:17.703
Esposita.

03:24:18.747 --> 03:24:20.998
My esposita.

03:24:24.336 --> 03:24:28.213
I know you would gladly
give your life for me...

03:24:28.381 --> 03:24:34.094
... but I am perfectly resigned.
Do not be sad.

03:24:35.388 --> 03:24:38.349
I hope I may yet recover.

03:24:42.479 --> 03:24:44.313
Pray for me.

03:24:45.649 --> 03:24:52.029
But in your prayers, never forget to
use the petition, "Thy will be done."

03:25:06.127 --> 03:25:11.757
I'm so glad you're here.
Your lemonade is delicious.

03:25:12.717 --> 03:25:15.177
- It's not too sweet.
- Too much sugar.

03:25:15.345 --> 03:25:18.013
I never told you that.

03:25:27.649 --> 03:25:33.779
Is that my sweet darling angel?

03:25:37.033 --> 03:25:39.201
My Julia.

03:26:05.270 --> 03:26:07.730
Is it certain, doctor?

03:26:11.651 --> 03:26:13.235
Does he know?

03:26:15.572 --> 03:26:17.322
I have not told him.

03:26:19.117 --> 03:26:20.617
Then I will.

03:26:21.453 --> 03:26:23.328
He must know.

03:26:24.414 --> 03:26:26.790
He must be prepared.

03:26:53.902 --> 03:26:55.944
My darling ...

03:26:59.032 --> 03:27:01.950
...today is Sunday.

03:27:04.454 --> 03:27:10.125
Do you know that the doctor says
you must very soon be in heaven?

03:27:13.129 --> 03:27:19.510
Do you not feel willing to acquiesce in
God's allotment if he wills you to go today?

03:27:25.350 --> 03:27:32.397
I prefer it.

03:27:35.485 --> 03:27:36.777
Well ...

03:27:38.696 --> 03:27:41.698
... by the time this day closes...

03:27:42.992 --> 03:27:47.579
...you will be with the blessed
Savior in his glory.

03:27:53.503 --> 03:27:59.800
I will be an infinite gainer
to be translated.

03:28:30.832 --> 03:28:32.416
General Lee.

03:28:38.423 --> 03:28:40.465
What is the news, Reverend?

03:28:40.633 --> 03:28:45.137
General Lee, I must report
that his case appears hopeless.

03:28:47.599 --> 03:28:52.060
His wounds are healing,
but he's dying of pneumonia.

03:28:55.064 --> 03:28:59.067
Surely General Jackson must recover.

03:28:59.736 --> 03:29:04.489
God will not take him from us, not now
that we need him so very much.

03:29:08.912 --> 03:29:11.163
Will you see him, sir?

03:29:13.082 --> 03:29:15.709
No, sir, I won't. No, sir.

03:29:24.928 --> 03:29:28.096
When you return, I trust
you'll find him better.

03:29:30.683 --> 03:29:36.813
And when the occasion offers, tell him
that I prayed for him last night...

03:29:39.609 --> 03:29:44.821
... as I never prayed,
I believe, for myself.

03:29:45.907 --> 03:29:52.537
Please tell him.

03:29:53.957 --> 03:29:55.415
Sir.

03:30:16.813 --> 03:30:18.814
Push up that column.

03:30:19.399 --> 03:30:21.358
Move up that column.

03:30:25.822 --> 03:30:29.199
Pendleton, take charge of that line.
Where's Smith?

03:30:33.121 --> 03:30:36.790
Tell him. Push up that column.

03:30:38.251 --> 03:30:43.547
Move the batteries to the center
of the crest. There's no time to waste.

03:30:44.590 --> 03:30:48.844
General Stuart, no quarter to the
violators of our homes and hearths.

03:30:52.974 --> 03:30:58.729
General Lee, we must take
the war to the enemy.

03:31:08.614 --> 03:31:11.199
You are the 1 st Brigade.

03:31:13.828 --> 03:31:16.288
Advance, my brave boys.

03:31:18.916 --> 03:31:23.170
Press on.

03:31:46.444 --> 03:31:49.571
Let us cross over the river...
