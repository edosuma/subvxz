00:08.258 --> 00:11.302
-[narrator] <i>Previously on</i> Riverdale:
-Ben and I thought it was a game.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.013
But it's not. It's so much more.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.098
-He's real. The Gargoyle King.
-Dilton?

00:17.642 --> 00:19.060
Ben. Hey.

00:19.561 --> 00:23.064
Framing Archie for murder,
conspiring to keep him locked away?

00:23.148 --> 00:25.191
You don't have a daughter anymore.

00:25.692 --> 00:26.943
We start a version of the Farm.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.529
You're actually buying this Farm crap

00:29.612 --> 00:32.282
that a huckster named
Edgar Evernever is selling you.

00:32.991 --> 00:33.825
[Alice] Oh, my God.

00:33.908 --> 00:35.410
-Betty.
-I didn't kill anyone.

00:35.493 --> 00:37.912
<i>But I could've.</i>
<i>I have to take responsibility.</i>

00:37.996 --> 00:40.123
I can't put everyone through this again. <i>I'll take the deal.</i>
<i>Your Honor, I'm guilty.</i>

00:44.085 --> 00:45.503
[school bell ringing]

00:46.337 --> 00:47.630
[Jughead] <i>We've all felt it.</i>

00:47.714 --> 00:49.466
<i>The first day of a new school year.</i>

00:50.300 --> 00:51.676
<i>Butterflies in the stomach.</i>

00:52.469 --> 00:54.512
<i>We've all looked around, and wondered,</i>

00:55.305 --> 00:56.556
<i>where will I fit in here?</i>

00:57.265 --> 00:58.850
<i>Who will I sit with at lunch?</i> <i>Will I even make it till lunch?</i>

01:09.611 --> 01:13.490
<i>Multiply that by a thousand,</i>
<i>and that's how Archie Andrews felt</i>

01:13.573 --> 01:14.908
<i>as he was being processed</i>

01:15.241 --> 01:18.411
<i>at the Leopold &amp; Loeb</i>
<i>Juvenile Detention Center.</i>

01:19.579 --> 01:22.791
Andrews. Warden wants to see you.
Let's go.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.221
It's Shakespeare. Know what it means?

01:36.763 --> 01:37.764
No, sir.

01:37.972 --> 01:40.809
Means you're alone
and have no one to blame but yourself.

01:41.601 --> 01:42.477
I read your file.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.980
Besides killing that boy at Shadow Lake...

01:47.315 --> 01:49.317
I'm told you have an affinity for music.

01:50.026 --> 01:51.111
We have a music room.

01:51.569 --> 01:53.154
No one uses it, but it's there.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.533
I keep an orderly house, Mr. Andrews.

01:56.616 --> 01:59.702
Respect that, and we'll get on just fine.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.789
-You understand?
-Yes, sir.

02:04.749 --> 02:08.128
I just got off the phone with the warden
at juvenile hall.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.004
He says Archie's been processed.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.215
-He's okay.
-Oh, thank God.

02:12.298 --> 02:16.678
Yeah. They got a line on those three thugs
that gave false testimony against him.

02:16.761 --> 02:19.055
I'm friends with the sheriff
at Shadow County.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.224
He found a campfire in the deep woods.

02:21.307 --> 02:24.561
Archie's in jail,
and these cretins are basically camping.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.646
Not for long. We'll make sure of that.

02:26.729 --> 02:29.732
Meanwhile I'll keep the home fires burning
at Riverdale High

02:29.816 --> 02:33.903
so everyone knows my Archiekins
will be back in time for Homecoming.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.656
And everything will be just as he left it.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.409
Dr. Patel kept Betty overnight
for observation,

02:39.492 --> 02:41.244
but it was just a precaution.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.329
Did he say what caused the seizure?

02:43.413 --> 02:47.625
They ran tests, but he suspects
it's just good old-fashioned stress.

02:48.418 --> 02:51.921
Oh, Betty.
I was up all night with the twins.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.924
-We were so worried about you.
-You were worried about me?

02:55.508 --> 02:57.802
And Juniper and Dagwood?
Are they all right?

02:57.886 --> 02:59.345
Okay, here we go again.

02:59.429 --> 03:02.307
Juniper and Dagwood are napping.
They're fine.

03:03.349 --> 03:04.434
Why wouldn't they be?

03:05.560 --> 03:10.899
Um, because I saw you and Mom throw
the twins into a giant bonfire last night.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.066
Right, that's enough.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.653
The only thing burning last night
was the hibachi in the backyard.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.072
-We made skewers with friends.
-From the Farm?

03:18.156 --> 03:19.449
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.577
You must've had a hallucination
while you had the seizure.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.126
It was so real.

03:31.753 --> 03:32.629
Sweetheart.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.505
[cell phone buzzing]

03:38.468 --> 03:39.427
[Betty] <i>My God.</i>

03:39.510 --> 03:41.012
-Dilton is dead?
-Yeah.

03:41.638 --> 03:44.515
And Ben from the drive-in?
He's barely hanging on.

03:44.599 --> 03:47.352
Doctors don't know when,
or if, he's even gonna wake up.

03:47.435 --> 03:50.897
Sheriff Minetta asked me
to keep it hush-hush for the families,

03:50.980 --> 03:52.649
but, Betty, what I saw was...

03:53.608 --> 03:55.777
-What, Jug?
-It was like a ritual site.

03:56.694 --> 04:01.032
Their lips were blue. There were chalices,
that were filled with poison or something.

04:01.115 --> 04:04.535
Animal bones were in a circle.
The tree had markings on it.

04:04.619 --> 04:07.247
There was a winged totem,
with a skull and branches.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.540
Was it a murder
or a suicide pact gone wrong?

04:09.624 --> 04:12.210
I have no idea. I saw Ben and Dilton.

04:12.293 --> 04:13.920
Playing a weird game at Pop's.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.839
Dilton was raving
about someone called the Gargoyle King.

04:18.675 --> 04:22.470
I was also thinking that maybe
you and I could investigate this together.

04:23.554 --> 04:27.433
For old times' sake. Or at least until
we catch a new lead with Archie's case.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.561
I like that idea.

04:33.481 --> 04:36.818
I'll try to see if Dr. Curdle can get us
into the coroner's office.

04:36.901 --> 04:39.404
Have more romantic words ever been spoken?

04:39.487 --> 04:40.405
No.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.574
[man] You bunk with Mad Dog.

04:43.658 --> 04:44.575
[inmates shouting]

04:51.541 --> 04:53.751
[jazz music playing on speakers]

04:53.876 --> 04:55.044
Hey.

04:55.878 --> 04:57.672
I'm Archie. You're Mad Dog, right?

04:58.047 --> 04:58.965
[exhaling sharply]

05:14.939 --> 05:16.316
How long you been in?

05:23.031 --> 05:24.032
[music stops]

05:34.876 --> 05:37.170
-Listen, since we're cellmates--
-Nice shoes.

05:38.546 --> 05:40.214
I'd keep them tied real tight.

05:48.514 --> 05:52.810
Mr. Weatherbee? As Archie's girlfriend,
and former running mate,

05:52.894 --> 05:56.647
I wanted to let you know I'm stepping in
as interim student body president.

05:56.731 --> 05:59.609
Sorry, someone else already petitioned
to be president.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.320
-Just this morning.
-What? Who did?

06:03.863 --> 06:08.284
Cheryl, what do you think you're doing,
trying to steal Archie's presidency?

06:08.368 --> 06:10.953
Who would you have lead us
through these dark times?

06:11.037 --> 06:13.122
Ethel Muggs? I saw the poor girl earlier.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.249
She was fuguing about a winged creature

06:15.333 --> 06:17.001
-that was after her.
-Actually...

06:17.418 --> 06:19.337
I thought I'd keep Archie's seat warm.

06:20.838 --> 06:24.384
Why? When JFK was shot,
Jackie O. didn't become president.

06:24.467 --> 06:25.593
Lyndon B. Johnson did.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.887
And then he lead us into Vietnam.

06:28.930 --> 06:29.972
I'm just saying.

06:31.265 --> 06:33.893
Her man's in the big house, Cheryl.
Give her a break.

06:33.976 --> 06:38.898
I get it. And I sympathize, up to a point.

06:38.981 --> 06:40.566
But let's be reals, Veronica.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.985
I need this presidency
for college applications

06:43.069 --> 06:44.320
a lot more than Archie.

07:07.802 --> 07:08.803
You mind if I sit? I'm Slash.

07:19.730 --> 07:20.857
Who gave you that ink?

07:20.940 --> 07:22.775
-Looks fresh.
-FP Jones did.

07:23.359 --> 07:27.363
His son, Jughead, made me a Serpent.
Said I could hang out with you guys.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.866
[Joaquin] You're no Serpent, Archie.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.704
Joaquin.
What the hell are you doing in juvie?

07:35.204 --> 07:37.915
Didn't you hear?
I came to town to help Fangs escape,

07:38.583 --> 07:39.500
stuck around.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.170
Got hauled in during Riot Night.

07:43.671 --> 07:47.383
I know this guy, Slash.
He's Mr. Clean-Cut, All-American.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.343
You're Jughead's pal, not a Serpent.

07:49.844 --> 07:53.639
You have to earn our trust and protection,
with a test of loyalty.

07:54.891 --> 07:55.892
See that Ghoulie?

07:58.853 --> 08:00.313
I want you to go up to him...

08:02.773 --> 08:03.774
and shiv him.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.945
Don't worry about the guards.
We pay them to turn a blind eye.

08:10.072 --> 08:12.825
Do that,
and then we'll have your back, huh?

08:12.909 --> 08:13.951
You're kidding, right?

08:21.459 --> 08:22.585
Not gonna happen, bro.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.463
I don't need your protection that bad.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.592
[inmate] Nice shoes.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.260
[inmates whistling]

08:36.516 --> 08:37.350
Dr. Curdle?

08:39.560 --> 08:41.812
-Oh. You're not--
-I'm his son.

08:42.146 --> 08:45.775
We spoke over the phone earlier.
I took over after my father passed away.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.402
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Do you have the money?

08:55.826 --> 08:57.411
The toxicology report revealed

08:57.495 --> 09:00.122
lethal levels of cyanide
in Mr. Doiley's blood.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.459
I surmise the surviving boy
didn't drink enough to finish the job.

09:03.543 --> 09:07.213
Dr. Curdle, if you had to guess,
murder or suicide?

09:07.296 --> 09:10.591
Well, the body did show signs of stress.

09:12.468 --> 09:15.137
Three symbols carved out on his back.
Runic, I'd say.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.430
Mind if I get a shot of this?

09:19.809 --> 09:22.979
What caused, uh... the blue lips?

09:23.062 --> 09:26.148
The cyanide was mixed
into a sugary drink called Fresh-Aid.

09:26.816 --> 09:27.858
Blueberry-flavored.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.572
There's something dimly familiar
about this.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.658
But you asked me before
if I thought this was murder,

09:36.033 --> 09:37.034
or suicide.

09:37.118 --> 09:40.663
I'm not sure what it is,
but whatever it is,

09:40.746 --> 09:43.583
it's darker
than what happened to Jason Blossom,

09:44.166 --> 09:45.543
or what the Black Hood did.

09:45.626 --> 09:48.296
No, what we're looking at here, I believe,

09:49.171 --> 09:50.965
is the true face of evil.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.421
[playing blues tune]

10:42.433 --> 10:44.644
-What's up, guys?
-You don't remember us?

10:44.727 --> 10:46.187
Should I? Have we met before?

10:46.562 --> 10:49.482
We were at the drag race
the day you called the cops on us.

10:49.565 --> 10:50.775
We're in because of you.

10:51.776 --> 10:52.610
Ghoulies.

10:52.943 --> 10:53.778
Crap.

10:53.903 --> 10:56.030
Look, I don't want any trouble. I'm sorry. Neither do we. We just want your shoes.

11:00.409 --> 11:01.452
What?

11:03.829 --> 11:04.914
Don't touch his face.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.003
Why are you sitting that way?

11:11.379 --> 11:12.963
I'm just a little sore, Ronnie.

11:13.422 --> 11:14.340
Sore from what?

11:15.257 --> 11:17.134
Working out. There's an amazing gym.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.135
Uh-huh.

11:19.470 --> 11:22.056
And where are your shoes?

11:22.556 --> 11:25.518
The warden took them when I got here,
with my other clothes.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.186
-That makes no sense.
-Ronnie.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.063
Talk to me about school.

11:29.772 --> 11:32.108
What am I missing?
How's the speakeasy coming?

11:33.025 --> 11:33.859
It's coming.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.112
What's it like,
being president in my place?

11:39.031 --> 11:42.493
Hi, I'm checking in on the status
of a friend of mine, Ben Button.

11:44.912 --> 11:47.289
Oh. Wait, he's out of the ICU?

11:47.373 --> 11:48.916
That's great.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.252
Uh, what time are your visiting hours?

11:52.878 --> 11:54.004
Uh, thank you.

11:56.173 --> 11:57.133
[Betty sighs]

11:57.758 --> 11:58.592
Hi.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.053
I'm Evelyn. And you're Betty Cooper?

12:01.137 --> 12:02.847
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

12:03.305 --> 12:06.100
Not exactly. We almost met,
through your mom and sister.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.396
-They're studying with my dad.
-Edgar Evernever.

12:10.479 --> 12:11.647
Yeah. That's right.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.316
Anyway, I go to school here now.
I wanted to say hi,

12:14.400 --> 12:17.945
let you know I won't tell anyone
about what happened the other night.

12:18.529 --> 12:21.031
-What are you talking about?
-Your seizure, of course.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.869
Wait, sorry, you--? You were there?

12:24.952 --> 12:28.622
Your mom invited us over for a cookout,
and to burn a few of her things.

12:29.498 --> 12:30.499
How are you feeling?

12:32.293 --> 12:33.502
Uh... [chuckles]

12:33.836 --> 12:35.171
Um...

12:35.921 --> 12:39.258
Uh, you know what, Evelyn? I have to go.

12:39.341 --> 12:42.386
I have to visit a friend in the hospital.

12:42.470 --> 12:43.304
So...

12:43.387 --> 12:45.473
Yeah, no worries. I totally understand.

12:52.021 --> 12:54.815
-Dude, what are you doing?
-What we've done all summer.

12:54.899 --> 12:57.109
I thought we'd sneak off
to the boiler room--

12:57.193 --> 12:58.611
My dad is right over there.

13:01.655 --> 13:02.490
Why?

13:03.574 --> 13:05.326
He's the new RROTC instructor.

13:05.618 --> 13:06.786
He's making me sign up.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.080
If he's around school,
we have to take it easy.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.707
Hey, Cadet Mason.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.293
On time is late. Let's go. Room 302.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.133
Talk to you later.

13:23.886 --> 13:25.221
[school bell ringing]

13:25.304 --> 13:26.931
[pop music playing on speakers]

13:40.194 --> 13:41.237
Veronica.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.947
That's right, you work here now.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.032
Cherry phosphate and curly fries. Girls?

13:45.115 --> 13:47.368
I don't work at Pop's, Cheryl. I own it.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.870
And as of this moment,
you're no longer welcome.

13:50.746 --> 13:53.374
You can't discriminate against someone
'cause they're better-looking.

13:53.499 --> 13:56.877
Cheryl, you're acting like trash,
and I don't wanna get a citation.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.337
[sighs]

13:59.171 --> 14:01.215
Vixens, leave us be.

14:05.469 --> 14:06.303
Now, then.

14:07.721 --> 14:09.098
What are you mad about?

14:09.181 --> 14:12.017
It can't be that I'm making a play
for student body president.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.186
Actually, that's exactly why I'm mad.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.564
I promised Archie that when he gets out,

14:16.647 --> 14:18.649
I'll have everything in place, waiting.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.776
That includes this stupid presidency.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.153
Just a suggestion,
but maybe channel that rage

14:23.237 --> 14:26.782
into something more productive,
like getting your boyfriend sprung.

14:28.617 --> 14:31.245
There's an organization
called the Innocence Project.

14:31.328 --> 14:34.039
Looked into it when I was accused
of Jay-Jay's murder.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.624
Maybe check it out.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.044
A little food for thought.

14:40.254 --> 14:42.047
Speaking of food, cancel my order.

14:42.756 --> 14:44.133
I'm going to TGI Thursdays.

14:49.471 --> 14:53.309
[woman on PA] <i>Dr. Matthews to Pediatrics.</i>

15:01.984 --> 15:02.943
[EKG beeping]

15:04.904 --> 15:06.739
Hi, Mrs. Button.

15:08.324 --> 15:11.535
-We wanted to see how Ben was doing.
-How do you know my Ben?

15:11.619 --> 15:15.289
Uh... From school. And he and I worked
at the Twilight Drive-In.

15:15.372 --> 15:16.290
Oh.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.460
How he's doing?

15:19.543 --> 15:21.962
He's stabilized,
but he hasn't woken up yet.

15:22.796 --> 15:25.925
Do you know what happened
in the woods, Mrs. Button?

15:26.008 --> 15:30.137
No. Ben's always been a bit
of an odd duck, you could say.

15:30.220 --> 15:33.682
Kept to himself. Especially after
his piano teacher was murdered.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.894
But this summer, he became friends with--

15:36.977 --> 15:37.978
Dilton Doiley.

15:38.062 --> 15:41.315
That's right.
It's like he became a different person.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.569
Secretive, sneaking out at all hours.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.155
Having these horrible nightmares.

15:48.948 --> 15:49.782
Mrs. Button.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.411
Know what this is, or how it got here?

15:54.495 --> 15:56.413
Maybe that nice girl left it.

15:56.830 --> 15:58.582
Someone else came to visit Ben?

15:58.666 --> 16:00.125
Another friend from school.

16:00.751 --> 16:03.295
I don't remember her name.
She wore a bow in her hair.

16:07.341 --> 16:08.801
Jughead, Betty.

16:08.884 --> 16:11.345
I don't care how Keller ran things
when he was sheriff.

16:11.428 --> 16:15.224
I won't let a couple teenagers
compromise an active murder investigation.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.518
If it's an active murder investigation,

16:17.601 --> 16:19.561
start by letting
the rest of the town know.

16:19.645 --> 16:20.479
Sheriff Minetta?

16:21.939 --> 16:24.650
-What, Henderson?
-An Adventure Scout's parents called.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.694
-Haven't seen him in two days.
-What?

16:26.777 --> 16:30.072
We've got a missing kid.
And he was part of Dilton Doiley's troop.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.792
-[Veronica] Madam Mayor.
-Wait, why are you not in school?

16:41.875 --> 16:44.795
I'm on my way, but this couldn't wait.

16:45.379 --> 16:49.091
I'm starting a chapter
of the Innocence Project here in Riverdale

16:49.174 --> 16:51.427
and with a letter of support
from Town Hall,

16:51.510 --> 16:53.762
I can cut through all that silly red tape.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.515
I can't get in this war
between you and your father.

16:56.598 --> 16:59.518
But I'm not here as your daughter.
I'm here as a citizen.

17:00.394 --> 17:03.522
One of your constituents
sits in juvenile detention,

17:03.605 --> 17:07.276
wrongfully convicted,
and I intend to get him acquitted.

17:08.027 --> 17:08.861
[Veronica sighs]

17:08.944 --> 17:12.072
Your endorsement could help sway
a lot of dubious minds.

17:12.865 --> 17:13.741
Please, Mom.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.037
Fine.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.789
-I'll have Gloria draft a letter.
-Wonderful.

17:21.957 --> 17:24.043
Oh, and I'm also accepting donations.

17:26.670 --> 17:27.671
[Jughead] Hi, Ethel.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.841
-Does this look familiar to you?
-Where'd you get it?

17:32.718 --> 17:34.053
Ben's hospital room.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.806
-Why were you there?
-I don't have to tell you anything.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.516
-You're not police.
-Ethel, wait.

17:39.600 --> 17:43.437
We're trying to find out what happened
to Ben, Dilton, and the missing Scout.

17:43.854 --> 17:45.481
-Is it the Gargoyle King?
-How do you know?

17:45.564 --> 17:47.900
Dilton started to tell me,
but only got so far.

17:48.776 --> 17:49.610
So, is it?

17:50.819 --> 17:51.945
No. No.

17:52.029 --> 17:52.946
It's the opposite.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.492
I made that talisman to-- To protect Ben.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.661
-How do you even know Ben?
-He's my boyfriend.

17:59.745 --> 18:03.957
-I've never seen you two together.
-We started dating this summer.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.336
-We spent all our time in the bunker.
-Bunker?

18:09.296 --> 18:10.130
Never mind. Ethel, just...

18:12.257 --> 18:13.175
What bunker?

18:16.345 --> 18:17.179
Dilton's.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.097
In the woods.

18:18.305 --> 18:21.141
Dilton Doiley has a secret bunker
in the woods?

18:23.477 --> 18:24.728
It was our secret spot.

18:25.729 --> 18:28.982
-And Dilton's, too.
-Can you at least tell us where it is?

18:29.650 --> 18:30.859
I mean, I can't.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.277
It's too hard to describe.

18:32.694 --> 18:34.404
Then can you show us where it is?

18:35.155 --> 18:38.492
Ethel, it's either us or Sheriff Minetta.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.537
Okay, fine.
But you have to keep it a secret.

18:41.620 --> 18:42.663
-Sure.
-Of course.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.873
And go at night, so nobody can see us.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.542
Know where Fox Footbridge is?

18:54.716 --> 18:55.843
I tried to warn you.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.302
Yeah.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.808
Apparently,
the Ghoulies really like sneakers.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.268
You're a Serpent.

19:04.893 --> 19:07.855
-Why didn't they look out for you?
-I wouldn't shiv a Ghoulie.

19:13.152 --> 19:13.986
How come?

19:14.278 --> 19:16.321
Because that's not who I am.

19:18.115 --> 19:18.949
Maybe not yet.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.451
But you will be soon.

19:22.035 --> 19:24.163
When you got here, you lost your humanity.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.081
You're an animal in a cage now.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.417
An animal does whatever he has to do
to live.

19:28.917 --> 19:31.378
-To survive.
-What do you do, Mad Dog?

19:31.879 --> 19:34.006
You're not a Ghoulie.
You're not a Serpent.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.508
I doubt anyone in here messes with you.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.636
You have stuff no other prisoner does.
Why?

19:40.387 --> 19:41.471
You don't wanna know.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.975
And trust me, you don't wanna get tapped.

19:45.058 --> 19:46.810
But take my advice this time.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.270
Be an animal.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.190
Before they kill you like one.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.660
What is wrong with the two of you?

20:03.744 --> 20:05.621
-Dad?
-What's going on?

20:05.704 --> 20:08.123
-Sheriff Minetta called. Said--
-Called us both.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.293
He caught you snooping around Ben's room
at the hospital.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.921
Look, Dad,
something weird is going on here.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.505
No one wants to talk about it.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.091
But Dilton came to me for help.
You were there.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.552
-I feel like I owe him something.
-You don't owe him anything.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.638
-It's nothing to do with you.
-And Betty,

20:22.721 --> 20:25.307
this is exactly
what Dr. Patel was talking about. Keep it up, young lady,
you'll have another seizure.

20:29.394 --> 20:30.604
Seizure?

20:32.231 --> 20:33.774
Did you have a seizure and not tell me?

20:34.358 --> 20:35.734
She most certainly did,

20:35.817 --> 20:38.987
because you keep dragging her
into these murder investigations.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.698
You are unbelievable, Mom.

-Hey, Betty.
-FP, can you please--?

20:44.576 --> 20:46.036
Don't even think about it.

20:46.286 --> 20:48.622

Everyone needs to cool off.

You didn't have to get me anything.

20:55.879 --> 20:58.090

That's why I didn't say anything.

it was too tall to be Ethel, I think,

26:03.061 --> 26:05.897

26:39.764 --> 26:42.267
I think
this football game is a fantastic idea.

26:42.934 --> 26:43.768
But is it safe?

26:43.852 --> 26:45.020
It's fully sanctioned.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.146
Everyone wants this.

26:46.229 --> 26:48.356
The Ghoulies, the Serpents,

26:48.440 --> 26:51.776
everyone wants to feel... free.

26:51.860 --> 26:56.072
Ugh. I so wish I could be there,
cheering you on to victory.

26:56.489 --> 26:57.324
Me, too.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.952
And if ever
a group of guys needed a pep rally.

27:05.332 --> 27:08.251
I've reconsidered your bid
for student council president.

27:08.335 --> 27:09.836
Why, pray tell?

27:09.919 --> 27:11.338
Because you were right.

27:11.421 --> 27:15.258
Protecting Archie's presidency doesn't
really help him in any meaningful way.

27:15.342 --> 27:17.677
-I'm glad you've come to your senses.
-However,

27:17.761 --> 27:20.388
I know something
that would help bolster his spirits.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.849
But I would need your help,
and the Vixens.

27:25.769 --> 27:27.771
-Thanks, Delores. See you around.
-Sure.

27:29.105 --> 27:30.106
[doorbells jingle]

27:31.524 --> 27:32.942
-Hey, handsome--
-Hey, Kev.

27:35.362 --> 27:39.949
Um, me and some of the guys
from the RROTC are having a chow-down.

27:40.033 --> 27:41.868
But I'll see you at school tomorrow?

27:42.661 --> 27:44.162
Moose, are you ashamed of me?

27:44.829 --> 27:45.872
No, I just...

27:47.332 --> 27:48.333
I'm with the guys.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.043
I'll talk to you later.

27:55.090 --> 27:57.550
-Will you play football with us, Mad Dog?
-Can't.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.303
Warden says I got other business.

28:03.473 --> 28:04.891
Who the hell are you to him?

28:08.186 --> 28:09.187
Before this place... [Mad Dog sighs]

28:15.068 --> 28:16.152
I had a mom.

28:16.986 --> 28:17.862
A little brother.

28:18.405 --> 28:19.239
A girl, too. Liz. [chuckles]

28:21.491 --> 28:23.618
They used to come visit me every Saturday.

28:24.619 --> 28:27.247
One day the warden tells me
I can't see them anymore.

28:27.622 --> 28:28.623
They've been banned.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.084
It's for my own good, he said.

28:32.961 --> 28:33.962
That was two years ago.

28:34.796 --> 28:35.839
That's not right.

28:35.922 --> 28:38.383
Next month,
they'll transfer me to a real prison,

28:38.466 --> 28:40.719
where I'll spend the next 20 years.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.554
You got a life after this.

28:42.637 --> 28:43.471
A girl.

28:44.097 --> 28:45.890
Don't let them take that away from you.

28:49.561 --> 28:50.854
Let's go, Mad Dog.

29:01.614 --> 29:03.324
Good luck with the game, Archie.

29:09.789 --> 29:10.874
[Jughead grunting]

29:17.630 --> 29:18.590
Wow.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.594
Dilton really was a hardcore survivalist.

29:25.638 --> 29:26.639
I'll go first.

29:39.611 --> 29:40.445
Good God.

29:41.404 --> 29:43.782
It's like the inside
of a Philip K. Dick novel.

29:51.080 --> 29:55.376
I think this is all...
that game they were playing.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.714
Yeah, Gryphons &amp; Gargoyles.

30:00.673 --> 30:03.092
Looks like Ben and Dilton
were in pretty deep.

30:03.176 --> 30:05.220
I wonder if Ethel was playing with them.

30:09.849 --> 30:10.892
Jug.

30:13.144 --> 30:15.271
Is it the thing
that came at us last night?

30:15.355 --> 30:16.940
Yeah, the Gargoyle King?

30:17.524 --> 30:19.609
He's also featured on this copper coin.

30:22.695 --> 30:23.530
Betty.

30:26.658 --> 30:27.492
Oh, God.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.412
"Drink from the correct cup."

30:31.913 --> 30:32.956
Blue lips, cyanide.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.041
It was a challenge.

30:35.124 --> 30:37.210
Part of that stupid game they're playing.

30:37.961 --> 30:41.381
Pick the chalice that's not poisoned,
and...

30:42.131 --> 30:43.842
win, I guess?

30:44.676 --> 30:45.927
So, it was suicide?

30:46.553 --> 30:47.387
Maybe.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.515
Or something even more insidious.

31:02.986 --> 31:04.279
[screaming]

31:06.948 --> 31:09.242
-Know how worried your folks are?
-Doesn't matter.

31:09.325 --> 31:11.995
I'm supposed to hide,
until Master Doiley comes back.

31:14.330 --> 31:15.164
Jeez.

31:16.916 --> 31:19.335
Kid, haven't you heard?
Dilton's not coming back.

31:20.044 --> 31:22.213
-That's a lie.
-[Betty] No. It's not.

31:23.631 --> 31:24.883
Dilton is...

31:26.050 --> 31:26.885
dead.

31:28.511 --> 31:29.512
I'm sorry.

31:30.763 --> 31:32.849
You played Gryphons &amp; Gargoyles
with Dilton?

31:32.932 --> 31:36.644
I was his apprentice. He was teaching me
so I could join the game.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.647
With Ben Button,
and Ben's girlfriend Ethel Muggs?

31:39.731 --> 31:43.568
Yes, but Princess Etheline isn't
dating Ben in real life, only in the game.

31:44.319 --> 31:46.779
She warned me two enemies
might invade the bunker.

31:46.863 --> 31:48.281
Okay, well, game's over.

31:48.364 --> 31:50.283
All right?
I'm gonna get you back to your folks.

31:50.366 --> 31:53.119
Then we need to pay another visit
to Princess Etheline.

-No, this is great.

It's about to get a whole lot better.

-And you had nothing better to do.
-As disrespectful as you're being,

I won't let you flush your life
down the drain for a boy, a criminal.

And I think you'll find that after today,
you won't be allowed to visit Archie.

He'd hook you up, too.

36:56.005 --> 36:57.673
You blew us off, Ethel.

And you knew where the missing Scout was,
and didn't say anything to anyone.

37:01.594 --> 37:05.264
-Also, you and Ben aren't really dating.
-Yes, we are. We're in love.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.808
No, Ethel, you were playing a game.

but you have to stop lying.

-I'm not lying.
-Okay.

to Sheriff Minetta.

he's gonna get very, very angry.

-Yeah, hi. Uh...

at Riverdale High. Send an ambulance.

You've got ten minutes.

38:07.827 --> 38:08.661
Hello, Archie.

38:09.745 --> 38:11.289
My name is Monica Posh.

38:11.372 --> 38:14.000
I'm with Riverdale's chapter
of the Innocence Project

38:14.542 --> 38:16.752
I'll be working
to get you out of this place.

38:20.589 --> 38:23.384
Welcome, Cadets, to the RROTC.

38:23.467 --> 38:24.552
Excuse me, Major Mason?

38:26.053 --> 38:28.764
My name's Kevin Keller.
Hope it's not too late to join.

38:28.848 --> 38:30.766
Keller. You Tom Keller's boy?

38:30.850 --> 38:32.143
-I am, sir.
-[Mason] Hell.

38:32.643 --> 38:35.563
Tom and I were in the RROTC together,
back in the day.

38:36.188 --> 38:38.566
Come on in, son.
Take a seat. We'll get started.

38:48.993 --> 38:49.994
[man] Open it.

38:59.503 --> 39:01.672
You caused quite the commotion in my yard.

39:01.756 --> 39:04.216
You sent three of my men to the infirmary.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.551
Where's Mad Dog, warden?

39:05.634 --> 39:08.220
Captain Golightly said he died
in the riot,

39:08.304 --> 39:10.056
when he wasn't even there.

39:10.139 --> 39:11.307
What did you do to him?

39:13.851 --> 39:16.103
Save that righteous anger, young man.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.521
You're going to need it. You impressed me today.

39:21.734 --> 39:24.195
-Proved you have what it takes.
-What's happening?

39:24.278 --> 39:25.237
You've been tapped.

39:26.405 --> 39:27.990
You're gonna be my new Mad Dog.

39:33.746 --> 39:35.581
Some of you know why we're here.

39:36.624 --> 39:38.751
And some of us are sworn enemies.

39:39.126 --> 39:41.003
But we made a vow in high school.

39:41.087 --> 39:43.881
Now that the Scout is back,
safe and sound, thank God...

39:44.423 --> 39:46.592
we can only assume
that he'll start talking,

39:46.675 --> 39:49.053
and that whatever he says
might lead back to us.

39:51.180 --> 39:53.641
To the secret that we buried,
all those years ago.

39:53.724 --> 39:55.309
Why are you talking about this?

39:55.393 --> 39:59.105
This hasn't been made public yet, Fred,
but Dilton Doiley and Ben Button...

40:00.815 --> 40:02.775
were found in the woods with blue lips.

40:04.777 --> 40:05.903
Dilton is dead.

40:07.363 --> 40:08.364
Ben is in a coma.

40:09.490 --> 40:11.867
Don't you keep Sheriff Minetta
on a short leash?

40:11.951 --> 40:15.162
-Can't you just make this all go away?
-We control Minetta, yes.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.248
-Jughead found the body.
-That's the concern.

40:17.331 --> 40:20.126
We talked with Jughead and Betty,
told them to stop.

40:20.209 --> 40:22.169
But you know how crazy our kids can be.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.422
We made a pact
to never revisit that night.

40:24.505 --> 40:26.882
Not to mention it,
not to even think about it.

40:26.966 --> 40:30.261
-My vote is we stick to that.
-We might not have that luxury, Tom.

40:30.761 --> 40:33.431
Not if it's happening again.
Not if it's our children.

40:34.014 --> 40:35.891
All our children.

40:37.393 --> 40:38.394
They're in danger.

40:41.230 --> 40:43.190
[Betty] <i>Mrs. Muggs said Ethel's resting.</i>

40:43.816 --> 40:46.026
It just doesn't make sense, Jug.

40:46.110 --> 40:50.406
It can't be a coincidence,
but seizures aren't contagious.

40:50.489 --> 40:52.950
So... what? What is it?

40:54.452 --> 40:56.620
Sounds like another mystery
for us to solve.

40:58.247 --> 40:59.248
If you're up for it.

41:00.541 --> 41:01.375
I am.

41:02.418 --> 41:03.836
And maybe it's the same one.

41:03.919 --> 41:07.715
Maybe there's a connection
between the seizures

41:07.798 --> 41:09.800
and whatever happened to Dilton, and...

41:11.302 --> 41:13.429
Do you wanna check on Ben
while we're here?

41:19.018 --> 41:19.852
Ben? [Jughead] Ben.

41:22.730 --> 41:25.316
Hey, what are you doing?
Come away from the window.

41:25.399 --> 41:27.318
It's okay. Everything's okay.

41:27.735 --> 41:28.569
I know.

41:29.153 --> 41:32.198
I know it is.
I'm gonna be with Dilton now.

41:32.865 --> 41:34.116
We both flipped the coin.

41:34.200 --> 41:37.036
He was scared to ascend, but I'm not.

41:37.119 --> 41:40.456
What about--?
What about your Princess Etheline, huh?

41:40.539 --> 41:41.540
We'll be reunited. In the Kingdom.

41:43.918 --> 41:45.461
One day, all of us will.

41:45.544 --> 41:46.921
It's all part of his plan.

41:47.421 --> 41:48.297
-You'll see.
-Ben.

41:49.131 --> 41:49.965
Soon.

41:51.008 --> 41:52.885
-You'll fly, too.
-[Betty] Ben, no!
