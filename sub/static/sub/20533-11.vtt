WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:02.836
Previously on:

00:02.878 --> 00:04.212
Embryos are legally
considered property.

00:04.254 --> 00:06.590
I'm prepared to file a motion
in court to keep the embryos

00:06.632 --> 00:09.050
frozen indefinitely
or to have them destroyed.

00:09.092 --> 00:10.845
You can't do that.
You just watch me.

00:10.886 --> 00:13.597
Dr. Sukaly, I want
to let you know that I got

00:13.639 --> 00:16.099
my donor's signature,
giving up his paternal rights.

00:16.140 --> 00:17.476
Adrianna was was so worried
this morning

00:17.518 --> 00:19.269
when she saw Vanessa,
she told me everything.

00:19.311 --> 00:20.688
Stop pretending
you don't know she's back.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.397
You were on your way
to meet her.

00:22.439 --> 00:25.275
I can't let you do that.
(gasps)

00:25.317 --> 00:26.861
Annie?

00:26.902 --> 00:29.112
We're getting you
the hell out of here.

00:29.154 --> 00:31.615
I would have done anything
for you,

00:31.657 --> 00:34.075
but if you won't let me
protect you,

00:34.117 --> 00:37.037
you leave me no other choice.
No!

00:37.078 --> 00:39.999
(gunshot)

00:40.040 --> 00:42.209
(gasping)

00:47.381 --> 00:48.089
Hey!

00:49.257 --> 00:50.759
How is Annie?

00:50.801 --> 00:52.887
She's stable, but there's
still some internal bleeding,

00:52.928 --> 00:54.304
so they're prepping her
for surgery.

00:54.346 --> 00:55.723
Dixon's in there with her now.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.517
I'm sorry, but how the hell
did this happen?

00:58.559 --> 00:59.894
Ashley somehow thought
that I was

00:59.935 --> 01:01.687
getting back together with
Vanessa, so she kidnapped me.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.647
And Annie and Vanessa tried
to rescue me,

01:03.689 --> 01:05.482
and Annie got caught
in the crossfire.

01:05.524 --> 01:06.984
Oh, my God.
Wait. Vanessa?

01:07.026 --> 01:09.194
I thought she was out
of your life for good.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.822
She will be now.
She's going to jail.

01:11.864 --> 01:13.365
But Annie's gonna be okay?

01:13.407 --> 01:15.075
Yeah.

01:16.368 --> 01:18.871
I'm gonna check on Annie.

01:20.539 --> 01:22.958
(sighs)

01:27.254 --> 01:28.881
WOMAN:
Hello, Reykjavik Garden Hotel.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.340
Hi, I need to speak

01:30.382 --> 01:32.300
to one of your guests,
Max Miller. It's urgent.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.844
One of his friends had
an emergency.

01:33.886 --> 01:36.597
I'm sorry. Mr. Miller
never checked in.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.891
What? No, he left here
yesterday.

01:38.933 --> 01:40.684
He would definitely
be there by now.

01:40.726 --> 01:42.561
Unless something happened
with his flight.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.647
It looks like he canceled
his reservation, ma'am.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.403
Is everything okay?
What's going on?

01:51.445 --> 01:54.197
I think Max lied to me.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.241
Thanks.

02:01.789 --> 02:02.915
Hey.

02:02.957 --> 02:04.249
How is she?

02:04.291 --> 02:05.834
Annie has to have surgery,

02:05.876 --> 02:08.252
but the doctors think
she's gonna be okay.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.463
Oh, thank God.

02:09.503 --> 02:11.548
I know. It's
such a relief.

02:11.590 --> 02:14.009
Especially 'cause I feel
like this whole thing

02:14.051 --> 02:15.719
is partly my fault.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.805
What are you talking about?

02:17.846 --> 02:21.308
I was the one that told Ashley
that Vanessa was back.

02:21.349 --> 02:24.061
DIXON:
You did what?

02:24.103 --> 02:27.230
Dixon, I am so sorry.
Okay, I had no idea...

02:27.272 --> 02:29.149
Ade, my sister could've
been killed!

02:29.190 --> 02:30.859
I was just trying to help.
Well,

02:30.901 --> 02:32.193
you didn't, okay?

02:32.235 --> 02:34.362
And you're definitely
not helping now.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.490
Then I'll go.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.827
Look, man, hey,
I know you're upset, but that...

02:39.868 --> 02:40.953
that wasn't fair, all right?

02:40.995 --> 02:42.496
We're just trying
to be here for you.

02:42.537 --> 02:44.498
Well, maybe stop trying
so hard, okay?

02:44.539 --> 02:47.584
I'll be fine by myself.

02:51.922 --> 02:54.257
(sighs)

03:04.392 --> 03:06.227
So I guess

03:06.269 --> 03:08.271
we're not even talking now?

03:11.190 --> 03:12.651
Teddy, I'm sorry.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.528
I would never have involved
your Uncle Charles

03:14.569 --> 03:17.072
if I thought he was gonna try
to hold the embryos hostage.

03:17.114 --> 03:18.866
So basically you're sorry
because it didn't turn out

03:18.907 --> 03:19.950
the way you wanted.
No.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.451
I was desperate.

03:22.995 --> 03:25.080
Just trying to protect myself.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.832
Yeah, well, you've always
been pretty good at that,

03:26.874 --> 03:28.249
haven't you?

03:34.798 --> 03:36.800
Annie, I don't even
know what to say.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.552
I can never make
this up to you.

03:38.593 --> 03:39.761
What are you
talking about?

03:39.803 --> 03:40.679
This whole thing.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.974
It's completely my fault.

03:44.016 --> 03:46.393
I guess you can always count
on me to trust the wrong people.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.187
Ashley, Vanessa.
Liam,

03:48.228 --> 03:50.814
you met Vanessa
because of me, remember?

03:50.856 --> 03:52.900
You were rushing
to save me from Patrick,

03:52.941 --> 03:54.651
and she hit you with her car.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.611
Annie, that's crazy.
NURSE: It's
time to get her

03:56.653 --> 03:57.946
into the O.R.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.533
I just think maybe
you'd be better off

04:01.575 --> 04:04.161
if you hadn't met me
in the first place.

04:12.044 --> 04:15.714
(monitor beeping steadily)

04:31.772 --> 04:35.525
MAN:
Annie. Annie.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.444
Annie, can you hear me?

04:38.445 --> 04:40.197
Jason?

04:40.239 --> 04:41.949
What are you doing here?

04:41.990 --> 04:44.409
I drove down here as soon
as I heard what happened.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.411
You heard?

04:46.453 --> 04:48.205
About the shooting?

04:48.247 --> 04:50.582
Why would anybody call
my high school boyfriend?

04:50.624 --> 04:51.541
Annie, I think

04:51.583 --> 04:52.667
you're a little disoriented.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.669
You got hit on the head
when you collided

04:54.711 --> 04:55.921
with one of the flying monkeys.

04:57.131 --> 05:00.675
Okay, this has got
to be a dream.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.803
It's not. It's theater.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.974
What's going on?

05:07.015 --> 05:09.268
Where am I?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.186
You're in the Wichita Playhouse.

05:11.228 --> 05:14.731
But I live in Beverly Hills.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.817
Oh, sweetheart.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.071
You've always
lived in Kansas.

05:27.119 --> 05:29.997
(theme music playing)

05:53.561 --> 05:55.314
How are you feeling?

05:57.065 --> 06:00.610
I'm... still a bit confused.
(chuckles)

06:00.652 --> 06:02.779
The doctor said you might have
some temporary memory loss,

06:02.821 --> 06:05.115
but if you want,
it's safe to go to sleep.

06:05.157 --> 06:07.201
Sleep sounds good.

06:11.579 --> 06:13.248
I love you, Annie.
(chuckles)

06:13.290 --> 06:15.334
Uh, yeah, me, too?

06:25.010 --> 06:27.721
(groans)

06:27.762 --> 06:29.597
How's my little invalid?

06:29.639 --> 06:31.308
(groans)
Still here.

06:31.350 --> 06:34.102
(chuckling):
Yeah. I would hope so.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.521
So, you think you're
still up for a meeting

06:36.563 --> 06:38.565
with the caterer today
or should we cancel?

06:38.606 --> 06:40.692
Caterer?

06:40.734 --> 06:42.610
Oh, my God.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.612
We're getting married.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.366
(chuckling):
It's kind of freaky, right?

06:47.406 --> 06:50.535
I can't believe it's
in less than a week.
(moans)

06:51.536 --> 06:54.413
Something wrong?
Uh...

06:54.455 --> 06:57.792
I guess I'm just having
one of those moments

06:57.834 --> 07:01.129
where I'm seeing my life
from the outside in.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.924
Maybe Dixon will understand
what I'm talking about.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.636
Wait. Why don't I have
a number for Dixon?

07:08.678 --> 07:10.305
None of us do.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.349
Why not? Where is he?

07:12.391 --> 07:16.061
Uh, I guess your memory
isn't totally back yet.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.479
Dixon's in L.A.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.690
He moved away from here
as soon as he turned 18.

07:20.732 --> 07:23.818
And we just have no contact
with him? That's insane.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.612
Look, I know you keep hoping

07:25.653 --> 07:27.197
to make it better, but...

07:27.239 --> 07:29.699
What happened?

07:29.741 --> 07:33.078
He wanted to move to California.
You wanted to stay here.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.705
He had some big falling out
with your family

07:35.747 --> 07:38.125
that you've never wanted
to talk about,

07:38.166 --> 07:40.543
and you haven't been able
to get a hold of him since.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.422
Oh, my God.
I have to go find him.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.632
A-Annie, I think
it's probably best

07:45.673 --> 07:48.302
if you just get some
more rest. At least until

07:48.343 --> 07:49.761
you get back to
your normal self.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.512
Jason, getting married
without Dixon here

07:51.554 --> 07:53.556
would be the part
that isn't normal.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.100
I need to find him.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.229
(opens drawer)

07:59.271 --> 08:02.232
This is the last address
we have for him.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.651
I just don't

08:04.692 --> 08:06.111
want you to get your hopes up.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.363
Wait, this is Dixon's address?

08:16.704 --> 08:17.956
(Annie sighs)

08:17.998 --> 08:19.582
Hello?

08:19.624 --> 08:21.168
Is anybody here?

08:21.209 --> 08:22.252
NAOMI:
Hello!

08:22.294 --> 08:23.795
Entrez.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.255
Oh, my God.

08:25.297 --> 08:27.132
I am so happy
to see you.

08:27.174 --> 08:30.593
And I am thrilled
to see you, too.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.511
I like to start
everyone off

08:32.553 --> 08:33.929
in the living room.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.432
Stunning, don't you think?

08:35.474 --> 08:37.725
It also opens
to the outdoor courtyard,

08:37.767 --> 08:39.519
which is perfect for
indoor-outdoor entertaining.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.104
That is, if you
do entertain.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.231
If you don't like to entertain,
it's totally fine, too,

08:43.273 --> 08:45.692
because it can be
as quiet as an ashram.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.861
So you don't live here?

08:47.902 --> 08:49.112
I can see why

08:49.154 --> 08:50.405
you think that I would.
(chuckles)

08:50.447 --> 08:52.532
I put off a certain
high-end vibe, but...

08:52.573 --> 08:56.328
sadly, no. I'm handling
the open house. Naomi Clark.

08:56.370 --> 08:57.204
Hopkirk Real Estate.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.330
(chuckles)
Annie Wilson.

08:58.372 --> 08:59.622
NAVID:
Half-house cat,

08:59.664 --> 09:02.209
half-tiger.
Yes, for Dixon.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.626
Yes, that Dixon.

09:03.668 --> 09:06.671
Money's no object.
Okay. Uh-huh.
ANNIE: Navid?

09:06.713 --> 09:08.673
Oh, my God! Dixon!

09:08.715 --> 09:10.384
You actually
do live here!

09:10.425 --> 09:12.511
Yeah. Whatever.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.888
Dixon. It's me.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.181
Hey, she's pretty cute.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.432
I want her out of here.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.267
Yeah, she's disgusting.
I'm on it.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.144
All right,
open house is over.

09:21.186 --> 09:23.522
Oh, of course,
my apologies.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.814
But I have to talk to Dixon.

09:24.856 --> 09:26.024
Yeah, write him
a fan letter.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.108
(Annie scoffs)

09:28.776 --> 09:31.571
See ya.

09:31.612 --> 09:34.157
I can't believe this.
I came all the way from Kansas

09:34.199 --> 09:35.783
and he wouldn't
even look at me.

09:35.825 --> 09:38.078
And, what, he's some kind
of celebrity rap artist

09:38.119 --> 09:39.204
or something?

09:39.246 --> 09:40.580
Well, if you ask me,

09:40.621 --> 09:43.166
dating Adrianna Tate-Duncan
really put him on the map.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.710
So, wait,
Adrianna's famous, too?

09:45.752 --> 09:48.755
Um, you could say that.
(chuckles)

09:48.796 --> 09:50.257
I went to high school
with her.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.092
She got discovered playing
the lead in some musical.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.385
Spring Awakening.

09:53.427 --> 09:56.596
Because I wasn't there
to replace her as the lead.

09:56.637 --> 09:58.557
What?

09:58.598 --> 09:59.933
Nothing.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.226
Oh, honey.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.144
I'm gonna buy you a smoothie.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.020
Come on.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.105
Have you ever
had a smoothie?

10:05.146 --> 10:06.565
Do they have them
in Kansas?

10:06.606 --> 10:08.191
I kicked 'em out!

10:08.233 --> 10:11.027
Wa-kow!
(chuckles)

10:11.069 --> 10:13.947
Hey. That girl seemed like
she knew you or something.

10:13.988 --> 10:18.285
Um... yeah. Yeah, you know,
I'm used to it.
Oh.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.078
Everybody just
wants a piece.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.705
Just like Crazianna,
who won't stop texting me.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.707
Ade doesn't want
a piece of you.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.293
You had a relationship.
(clicks tongue)

10:26.334 --> 10:28.420
She's going through a
rough spot right now.

10:28.462 --> 10:29.712
And I'm not?

10:29.754 --> 10:31.881
WOMAN:
Here you go, baby.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.802
You know how much pressure's
on me right now to deliver?

10:35.843 --> 10:38.263
If this album isn't #1,
this could be it for me, man.

10:38.305 --> 10:41.224
You are under a lot of pressure.
Absolutely. I-I get it.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.518
And I can't have Ade's
raggedy ass around me right now.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.437
Not with the album
about to drop.
Hey.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.897
Hey, you just...

10:47.939 --> 10:50.858
used to care
about her, man.

10:51.818 --> 10:52.902
Okay.

10:52.944 --> 10:54.237
Whose friend do you
want to be? Huh?
Dude.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.072
Hers? You can be my guest,
all right?

10:56.114 --> 10:58.908
You two can go, uh,
trash hotel rooms together.
No, no, no.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.994
Come on. Hey, hey,
hey. Hey, I want...

11:01.035 --> 11:02.454
I want to be your friend.

11:02.496 --> 11:03.997
Hey. We are friends, right?

11:04.038 --> 11:06.583
I need to be super-careful
about my image right now.

11:06.625 --> 11:09.085
I can't have anybody mess it up.

11:09.127 --> 11:10.670
(laughing)

11:10.711 --> 11:12.005
Cheers.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.423
ADRIANNA:
Okay, look.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.300
I know that somebody
leaked this video to you,

11:15.342 --> 11:17.177
but I'm begging you,

11:17.218 --> 11:19.346
please don't release it
to your gossip blog.

11:20.472 --> 11:21.473
You mean,
don't do my job?

11:21.515 --> 11:24.142
Look, this movie
that I'm doing,

11:24.184 --> 11:25.393
they had me sign this contract

11:25.435 --> 11:26.853
that I'd be sober
until the end of it.

11:26.894 --> 11:29.981
Oh, what, you don't think
you look sober in this?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.858
(laughs)

11:31.899 --> 11:33.818
Lift up...

11:33.860 --> 11:35.195
I can't get...

11:35.236 --> 11:36.988
help me get this over my head.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.281
(sighs)

11:38.323 --> 11:40.825
Silver, this is my last shot
for a comeback.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.952
I am one big story away

11:42.994 --> 11:45.121
from getting my own
gossip show on TV.

11:45.163 --> 11:48.124
It's gonna make TMZ
look like Sesame Street.

11:48.166 --> 11:51.545
So if you really don't
want me to release this...

11:51.586 --> 11:53.129
find me something bigger.

11:53.171 --> 11:55.215
Okay, well, I don't know
what I could even do...

11:55.256 --> 11:56.966
I'm feeling really
generous today.

11:57.008 --> 11:59.678
You got 12 hours
until this goes viral.

11:59.718 --> 12:01.596
Happy digging, Adrianna.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.563
I just have to turn in
an assignment.

12:09.604 --> 12:12.315
Oh, I'm glad you still
go to CU. I mean...

12:12.357 --> 12:14.234
I didn't know
if you would have time,

12:14.275 --> 12:15.569
what with your job and all.

12:15.610 --> 12:16.653
Oh, well.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.071
I'm taking extension
school classes.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.698
I have big plans.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.782
That's great.
What are you majoring in?

12:21.824 --> 12:23.535
In finding a husband.
(laughs)

12:23.577 --> 12:25.662
That's why I'm taking
business classes.

12:25.704 --> 12:28.623
I plan on maximizing
their earning potential.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.375
Ooh...
Oh...

12:30.417 --> 12:32.586
What can I say?
I was destined to be rich.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.879
I used to be.
You know.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.964
Yeah, I...
I, uh, figured.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.717
What happened?

12:38.757 --> 12:41.261
Long story short?

12:41.302 --> 12:43.597
My sociopathic sister

12:43.638 --> 12:45.806
conned me out of my
entire trust fund,

12:45.848 --> 12:49.060
and she didn't quit until
she had every single cent.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.438
But didn't any of your friends
go out of their way

12:51.479 --> 12:52.813
to expose what a liar she was?

12:52.855 --> 12:54.857
I don't think
any of them knew.

12:54.899 --> 12:57.485
And Ethan, my boyfriend
at the time,

12:57.527 --> 13:00.113
was too busy cheating
on me to notice.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.615
But I'm over it now.

13:01.656 --> 13:02.907
I really am.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.368
I actually have
my sights set on...

13:05.410 --> 13:09.205
the biggest catch
on campus.

13:09.247 --> 13:11.790
Wow. I never thought he would be
the biggest anything on campus.

13:11.832 --> 13:13.084
Not him.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.793
His friend.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.006
Teddy?

13:26.931 --> 13:29.058
Teddy Montgomery
is the guy that you're after?

13:29.100 --> 13:31.018
You know him?
Uh, I guess not.

13:31.060 --> 13:34.439
But, um, his dad's a really
famous movie star, right?

13:34.481 --> 13:37.442
Yeah. And he's, like,
the next Andy Roddick.

13:38.693 --> 13:40.861
Play it cool.
He's coming over here.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.658
You talking
about me again, Naomi?

13:44.699 --> 13:47.285
Your ears must be playing
tricks on you, Teddy.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.662
TEDDY:
Oh, come on.

13:48.703 --> 13:49.870
You know you want me.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.205
This guy bothering you?

13:51.247 --> 13:53.291
You know, he really can't
be trusted around pretty girls.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.375
(chuckles)

13:54.417 --> 13:56.586
Anyway, you two
are cordially invited

13:56.628 --> 13:58.254
to a club opening tonight.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.589
Oh, wow.

13:59.631 --> 14:01.007
Is this your bar?

14:01.048 --> 14:02.717
No, I... I'm in college.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.552
What would I be doing
owning a bar?

14:04.594 --> 14:05.970
NAOMI:
Liam's stepfather

14:06.012 --> 14:07.472
is a very prominent
plastic surgeon.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.182
Stepfather?

14:09.223 --> 14:13.060
So, him and your mom
are, like, together and...

14:13.102 --> 14:14.562
Married?

14:14.604 --> 14:17.982
Yeah, that's usually
the origin of stepdads.

14:18.899 --> 14:20.276
Liam.

14:20.318 --> 14:21.778
Ty?

14:21.820 --> 14:24.238
Apparently,
my reputation precedes me.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.533
I'm sorry.
We haven't met before, have we?

14:26.574 --> 14:27.992
Think I would have remembered.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.829
Uh, no, no.
I'm... I'm new in town, but...

14:30.870 --> 14:33.289
don't go firing up
the private plane just yet.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.959
Uh, I mean,
assuming you have one.

14:37.001 --> 14:40.171
Well, the tennis coach
is waiting for me.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.465
Naomi, see you
at the club tonight?

14:42.507 --> 14:44.925
Maybe you will.
Maybe you won't.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.512
Mm-hmm.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.472
This is perfect.

14:49.514 --> 14:50.807
It's great.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.975
But I really need to focus
on getting through to Dixon.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.310
Well, that's what
you're doing.

14:54.352 --> 14:55.936
The club Liam just
invited us to,

14:55.978 --> 14:57.188
Dixon's a part owner.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.523
I'm sure he'll be there.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.107
Oh, my God.
This is kind of perfect.

15:00.149 --> 15:02.068
And since I just decided
that I like you,

15:02.109 --> 15:04.487
I'm going to take
you shopping.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.033
So, how's it going on getting
that money you owe me?

15:09.075 --> 15:10.618
I'm working on it.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.912
Hey, I get a dollar
for every person

15:12.953 --> 15:15.707
who shows up at the club
tonight with one of these.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.250
What is that, like $100 max?

15:17.291 --> 15:19.377
You owe me a whole lot
more than that.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.504
Just ask your stepdad
for the money.

15:21.546 --> 15:22.839
I can't.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.591
If he finds out
I was betting on sports,

15:24.632 --> 15:27.176
he's going to yank me out
of school and send me packing.

15:27.218 --> 15:29.053
Okay, fine. I might have
another solution for you.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.055
I've been talking
to that Navid Shirazi guy.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.973
You know that dork
from high school?

15:33.015 --> 15:34.726
He's Dixon's lapdog now,

15:34.768 --> 15:37.854
and he's looking to score
some oxy for Dixon.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.980
You have access to some.

15:41.482 --> 15:44.985
Your stepdad.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.987
Wait, like,
his medical practice?

15:47.029 --> 15:48.155
Plastic surgery?

15:48.197 --> 15:49.949
Come on, the guy must be
swimming in that stuff.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.992
Just sneak a little bit and
bring it to the club tonight.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.870
I don't know, man--
selling drugs?

15:53.912 --> 15:55.121
It's just Navid.

15:55.162 --> 15:57.916
But hey, if you got a better way
to get me this money.

16:04.631 --> 16:08.134
I thought you said
we were going shopping.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.427
We are.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.887
I've already preselected
all the options

16:10.929 --> 16:11.971
from the best stores.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.431
Just don't spill anything
tonight.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.933
I have to return them.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.393
As for me, I need something
that says "marriage material"

16:17.435 --> 16:18.853
but not "mother of the bride."

16:18.895 --> 16:20.438
Ooh, hey.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.856
Here, try this one.

16:21.898 --> 16:26.694
So, uh, you really think
Teddy's the one for you.

16:26.736 --> 16:27.904
I know he's slept with every

16:27.946 --> 16:29.489
good-looking girl
from here to Pomona,

16:29.530 --> 16:31.031
but I am carefully
differentiating myself.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.451
I'm going to be aloof
and make him chase me

16:33.493 --> 16:35.620
until I have a ring
on my finger.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.163
Sounds like a foolproof plan.

16:37.204 --> 16:39.123
I mean, all men
are different,

16:39.165 --> 16:41.417
of course, which is why
I think it is great

16:41.459 --> 16:43.544
that you are going
on the aggressive with Dixon.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.171
Otherwise,
he might not notice you.

16:45.212 --> 16:46.464
No offense.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.800
Naomi, I am not trying
to hit on Dixon.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.844
He's my brother.
Yeah, I know.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.137
I can see the resemblance.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.472
My adopted brother.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.474
He was estranged from my family,
and I just...

16:56.516 --> 16:58.392
I really need to talk to him.

16:59.894 --> 17:01.688
You believe me, right?

17:02.772 --> 17:05.107
I believe you look amazing.

17:05.148 --> 17:08.569
And whatever it is
that you want tonight,

17:08.611 --> 17:10.237
you need to go for it.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.196
(chuckles)

17:11.238 --> 17:13.073
So do I.

17:14.951 --> 17:18.829
NAVID:
Hey, I think I lined up
something fun for us later.

17:18.872 --> 17:21.665
You know what, maybe
not tonight, all right?

17:21.708 --> 17:23.710
Yeah, you know,
I've been hearing a lot of, uh,

17:23.751 --> 17:25.419
cops have been doing
undercover busts on clubs.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.671
Hey, I'm on it.

17:26.713 --> 17:30.049
Well, I mean, I'm on
being off of it.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.885
Hey, no worries, man.

17:31.926 --> 17:33.260
You got this.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.221
Your new track's
going to kill them.

17:35.262 --> 17:38.057
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:38.098 --> 17:41.185
Westside, represent.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.355
See, I hustled my way up.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.065
You think you had it hard?

18:18.973 --> 18:20.725
Just hold off for
a minute, okay?

18:20.767 --> 18:23.436
These things are
all about timing.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.402
Somebody told me
a rumor about you.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.447
Spence Montgomery's son...

18:34.488 --> 18:37.742
has never had an
actual girlfriend.

18:38.868 --> 18:41.079
Could he be trying
to hide something?

18:41.120 --> 18:42.496
What?

18:42.538 --> 18:44.498
I'm not trying
to hide anything.

18:44.540 --> 18:47.043
I just like to play
the field. That's all.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.963
I've been that way ever since
we were in high school.

18:50.004 --> 18:53.549
Have you ever heard the term,
"confirmed bachelor"?

18:53.591 --> 18:55.384
It was historically used

18:55.426 --> 18:57.720
as code for "gay."

18:57.762 --> 18:59.388
So maybe that's what

18:59.430 --> 19:02.683
your player lifestyle
is actually telling us.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.310
Sounds like somebody forgot

19:04.351 --> 19:06.729
to take their crazy pills
this morning.

19:06.771 --> 19:09.482
Wow, did that comeback
just come to you just then?

19:09.523 --> 19:12.485
Man, and I thought
all jocks were dumb.

19:30.503 --> 19:34.423
Those are actually for,
um, role-play activities.

19:34.465 --> 19:37.301
They're the only ones
I have in your size.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.720
Um, we were invited.

19:39.762 --> 19:41.139
Yeah, so were all these
other people.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.432
Move to the back of the line.
Wait your turn.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.770
We are never getting in.

19:49.939 --> 19:52.859
Oh, oh. Maybe we'll
get in after all.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.735
(photographers clamoring)

19:54.777 --> 19:57.321
Okay, relax, relax.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.573
I'm wearing underwear.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.659
I think.

20:02.785 --> 20:04.704
Adrianna.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.288
Hi. It's Naomi.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.332
We used to be
best friends, you know,

20:08.374 --> 20:11.127
before you became
a big movie star.

20:11.169 --> 20:13.880
Oh. Oh, hey, Naomi.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.840
Do you have a breath mint?

20:15.882 --> 20:18.009
'Cause I think
I just puked a little.

20:18.051 --> 20:20.720
Oh, um, yeah. Hold on.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.388
Um, listen, we were
kind of wondering

20:22.429 --> 20:24.390
if you could maybe
help us get in.

20:24.431 --> 20:26.350
Annie here needs
to talk to Dixon.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.186
Why? You a groupie or something?

20:28.227 --> 20:29.520
No. I'm his sister.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.605
Sure you are,
and I'm his uncle.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.357
(laughing)

20:33.399 --> 20:35.442
My parents adopted Dixon
when we were eight.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.944
ADRIANNA:
Sweetie, I've been

20:36.986 --> 20:39.780
dating Dixon for, like,
a year and a half on and off,

20:39.822 --> 20:42.033
and he's never said anything
about being adopted

20:42.075 --> 20:43.743
or having a sister.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.536
Why does nobody
believe me?

20:45.578 --> 20:49.999
Well...
Here. Look at this.

20:50.041 --> 20:54.336
Dixon really does have
a white sister from Kansas.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.465
Can I borrow this for a second?

20:58.507 --> 20:59.550
Yeah,

20:59.592 --> 21:02.803
if, uh, you can get
us into the club.

21:02.845 --> 21:05.223
Of course.

21:11.854 --> 21:14.023
Dixon's right there.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.912
You know how you said
you wanted a bigger story?

21:27.954 --> 21:30.456
I think I just found one.

21:37.463 --> 21:38.965
Excuse me. Sorry.

21:39.006 --> 21:41.425
I just have to...

21:43.261 --> 21:46.180
I know you know me, even
if nobody else here does.

21:46.222 --> 21:47.556
What are you even doing here?

21:47.598 --> 21:49.183
I still don't understand
what happened.

21:49.225 --> 21:50.935
You happened, Annie.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.812
You always get
everything you want.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.855
I don't think that's true.
But that's how I felt,

21:54.897 --> 21:56.023
all right?

21:56.065 --> 21:57.691
Look, we, we put off moving

21:57.733 --> 21:59.819
because you were the lead
in the school musical,

21:59.860 --> 22:04.115
and then you got Les Mis, and
that was it-- Kansas forever.

22:04.157 --> 22:06.826
But, I mean, we must
have decided as a family.

22:06.867 --> 22:09.745
Yeah, but my vote
counted less.

22:09.787 --> 22:11.831
But it's fine, okay.
I'm good with it.

22:11.872 --> 22:14.208
I-I made my peace
with it.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.334
Just like I told you
when I left,

22:15.375 --> 22:18.545
I don't care 'cause you're
not my real family.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.214
That isn't true.

22:20.256 --> 22:21.507
What, did you
finally get beat

22:21.548 --> 22:22.967
out of a big part
of something?

22:23.009 --> 22:24.677
Is that why you came here
crying to me?

22:24.718 --> 22:26.344
What? No, I told you,

22:26.386 --> 22:28.973
I came to find you and make sure
that you were okay.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.058
Look, I'm not gonna
say it again, Annie.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.727
Okay, go home.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.437
Nobody wants you here.

22:47.574 --> 22:50.119
♪ ♪

22:50.161 --> 22:52.205
(clears throat)

22:52.246 --> 22:54.372
Oh, hello.

22:54.414 --> 22:55.624
Hi.
I almost forgot

22:55.666 --> 22:57.960
you said you were going
to be here.

22:58.002 --> 23:00.087
You know, I got to tell you,
there are a lot

23:00.129 --> 23:03.299
of hot ladies in here
tonight, but you...

23:03.341 --> 23:05.343
you're the top
one percent.

23:05.383 --> 23:07.261
Thank you.

23:07.303 --> 23:10.056
I tend to be a one-percenter
by nature.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.265
(chuckles)

23:11.307 --> 23:13.017
I feel I should tell you
something, too.

23:14.518 --> 23:16.854
I will not be sleeping
with you tonight.

23:16.896 --> 23:17.980
Really?

23:18.022 --> 23:21.234
It's just not my thing,
so if that's what you're after,

23:21.275 --> 23:24.195
I suggest you try barking up

23:24.237 --> 23:26.404
another one of the hottest trees
of the evening.

23:26.446 --> 23:28.199
Mm-hmm.

23:28.241 --> 23:29.700
If you'll excuse me...

23:32.661 --> 23:34.247
Uh, Na-Naomi, wait.

23:34.288 --> 23:36.498
Look...

23:36.540 --> 23:37.624
I know I come off

23:37.666 --> 23:42.004
as this player, but that's
not who I really am.

23:42.046 --> 23:43.172
Oh, no?

23:43.214 --> 23:46.466
I'm honestly looking
for something meaningful.

23:46.508 --> 23:48.468
I've just been waiting
to find the right girl.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.470
There someplace quiet

23:50.512 --> 23:52.723
we can go and just talk?

23:58.436 --> 24:00.189
Hey, have you seen Ty?

24:00.231 --> 24:02.524
Uh, no, sorry, man,
and I'm a little busy.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.569
Man, screw this.

24:07.363 --> 24:11.033
Hi, I need a cab to LAX.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.993
I'm at Seventh and...

24:13.035 --> 24:14.578
Oh!
Sorry.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.538
(gasping)

24:18.332 --> 24:19.750
Hey.

24:20.334 --> 24:21.877
Are you okay?

24:21.919 --> 24:26.215
Uh, no, not really,
not that you should care.

24:26.257 --> 24:28.342
I mean, we don't really know
each other at all.

24:28.384 --> 24:31.011
Well, I'm not gonna just
leave you there, so...

24:32.221 --> 24:34.265
(sighs)
Are you good?

24:34.307 --> 24:35.224
Yeah.

24:35.266 --> 24:37.310
Yeah, except, uh,

24:37.351 --> 24:39.395
my phone.

24:45.109 --> 24:47.778
May I offer you some tea?

24:47.820 --> 24:50.948
Look, Naomi, I'm gonna be
straight with you.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.532
I know you're trying
to set yourself apart

24:52.574 --> 24:54.243
by not sleeping with me.

24:54.285 --> 24:57.121
'Cause I'm not
that kind of girl.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.747
Because you're a gold digger.

24:58.789 --> 25:01.541
I don't know what
you're talking about.

25:01.583 --> 25:02.876
Creamer?

25:02.918 --> 25:04.670
Look, I'm not mad.

25:04.711 --> 25:06.380
I'm into it, actually.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.925
(clears throat)

25:09.967 --> 25:13.846
Naomi, will you be
my girlfriend?

25:13.887 --> 25:16.182
Wait, what? Really?

25:18.309 --> 25:22.271
Yes, I will so make it
worth your while.

25:22.313 --> 25:23.897
(laughs)
(grunts)

25:23.939 --> 25:26.984
All right, okay, so hold on.
Hold on a minute.
Oh, oh.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.069
(sighs)

25:30.779 --> 25:32.698
Can you be discreet?

25:32.739 --> 25:36.118
Oh, so you like things
of a kinky nature, do you?

25:36.160 --> 25:37.328
(chuckles)

25:37.370 --> 25:38.620
Yes, I can be discreet.

25:38.662 --> 25:42.041
'Cause the thing is...

25:42.082 --> 25:44.043
I'm gay.

25:44.084 --> 25:45.044
Huh?

25:45.085 --> 25:47.087
But you sleep
with women all the time.

25:47.129 --> 25:51.050
Yeah, as a cover,
but it's not working anymore.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.177
My family finds out,
they'll disown me,

25:53.219 --> 25:54.512
plus I'll lose any chance

25:54.552 --> 25:56.096
of getting
any big endorsement deals,

25:56.138 --> 25:59.058
so I need a steady girlfriend.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.809
If you sign on, I can get you
anything you ask for--

26:00.851 --> 26:05.563
new car, jewelry,
a better apartment.

26:05.605 --> 26:08.150
All you have
to do is act

26:08.192 --> 26:10.736
like our relationship is happy
and perfect and complete

26:10.777 --> 26:14.907
when it's actually not.

26:14.948 --> 26:19.036
Well, when I say that out loud,
it sounds like a lot to ask for.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.246
I'll do it.

26:20.287 --> 26:22.331
You will?

26:22.373 --> 26:23.581
(scoffs)
Hell, yeah.

26:23.623 --> 26:25.209
(laughs)

26:25.251 --> 26:26.085
All right.
Whoo!

26:26.126 --> 26:27.794
(both laughing)

26:27.836 --> 26:31.215
MEGAN:
Yes, I know other less
responsible drivers

26:31.257 --> 26:33.217
might be drinking.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.719
I'll be careful. I promise.

26:35.761 --> 26:36.720
I love you.

26:36.762 --> 26:39.390
All right, good night.

26:39.432 --> 26:40.598
(laughs)

26:40.640 --> 26:41.892
It's my dad.

26:41.934 --> 26:44.353
He can be a little
overprotective sometimes.

26:44.395 --> 26:46.813
Yeah, uh, that
must get annoying.

26:46.855 --> 26:47.940
It used to,

26:47.981 --> 26:51.068
but then, at some point,
I guess I just realized

26:51.110 --> 26:52.403
he does it 'cause he cares.

26:52.445 --> 26:55.281
You know, like I may not
actually need him

26:55.322 --> 26:58.451
to protect me anymore, but
I still need him, you know.

26:58.492 --> 27:00.286
He's my family.

27:00.327 --> 27:02.662
Yeah.
(chuckles)

27:04.498 --> 27:06.208
Hey, uh, you want,
you want a drink?

27:06.250 --> 27:07.960
Yeah.
Cool.

27:13.631 --> 27:15.884
Navid.

27:17.094 --> 27:18.887
Hey, man,
I got the stuff.

27:18.929 --> 27:21.390
Yeah, I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:21.432 --> 27:24.310
The stuff-- you know,
the thing we talked about.

27:24.351 --> 27:25.894
Dude, we had
a whole discussion

27:25.936 --> 27:27.854
about this the other day.
Okay, yeah, you know,

27:27.896 --> 27:29.106
we did not have a
discussion, all right,

27:29.148 --> 27:30.483
and we're not going to
discuss anything now.

27:30.524 --> 27:31.525
Then, why the hell
do I have

27:31.567 --> 27:33.444
a bunch of oxy on me tonight?

27:33.486 --> 27:35.821
MAN:
What'd you say
you're carrying?

27:36.654 --> 27:38.157
Seriously?

27:38.198 --> 27:40.409
(laughs)

27:40.451 --> 27:41.577
(Liam grunts)

27:42.911 --> 27:44.497
What, are you married?

27:44.538 --> 27:47.541
(chuckles)
Engaged apparently.
I don't know.

27:47.583 --> 27:50.043
Everything's a little confusing
for me right now.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.711
You,

27:51.753 --> 27:55.341
you look like you're
in a really good place.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.301
Yeah, I guess.

27:57.343 --> 27:58.302
(chuckles)

27:58.344 --> 27:59.845
(sighs)

27:59.886 --> 28:01.514
I was gonna do something
really stupid earlier,

28:01.555 --> 28:06.519
but I... just got to suck it
up and talk to my stepdad,

28:06.560 --> 28:08.686
hope everything works out.

28:08.728 --> 28:10.564
(grunts)
(gasps)

28:10.606 --> 28:11.815
My hero.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.026
I really appreciate

28:14.067 --> 28:15.861
you sticking around to help me.

28:15.902 --> 28:18.238
Hey, hey, hey, see, that's the
guy with the drugs, not me.

28:18.280 --> 28:19.532
I had nothing
to do with it.

28:19.573 --> 28:23.952
Well, uh, Officer, I-I think
this is a big mistake.

28:23.994 --> 28:25.745
Oh, I think
I understand just fine.

28:26.955 --> 28:30.042
I knew I should have gotten
out of here.

28:30.083 --> 28:33.462
Well, oh, my God, Liam.
I'm so sorry.

28:33.504 --> 28:36.465
This isn't right.
This isn't you.

28:36.507 --> 28:39.009
What's this all about--
a few pills?

28:39.051 --> 28:40.469
Man, this would have never
happened in my hood.

28:40.511 --> 28:41.428
(laughs)

28:41.470 --> 28:43.639
What, like the suburbs
in Wichita?

28:43.681 --> 28:47.518
(laughter)

28:47.560 --> 28:49.687
Matching sweaters--
what a dork.

28:51.188 --> 28:53.273
Wait, wait, guys.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.235
You posted it anyway?

28:56.276 --> 29:00.364
This way I get a bigger
makeup trailer for my show.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.949
I don't know why
I'm even surprised.

29:02.991 --> 29:05.202
You've been an evil bitch
ever since high school.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.496
Ha.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.708
Oh, Dixon.

29:10.749 --> 29:15.128
"Rapper Dixon's 'Street Cred'
Is a Bunch of Crap.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.630
New Album Guaranteed
to Flop."

29:16.672 --> 29:18.757
Oh.

29:18.798 --> 29:23.095
Thanks, Annie.
You ruined my life again.

29:23.136 --> 29:24.971
But...

29:26.724 --> 29:29.142
(sighs)

29:37.067 --> 29:39.319
God, I thought if I never
moved here in the first place,

29:39.361 --> 29:41.739
I wouldn't be able to screw up
any of your lives.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.031
Well, I was wrong.

29:43.073 --> 29:44.283
(laughing):
You're crazy.

29:44.324 --> 29:45.576
Liam got arrested tonight

29:45.618 --> 29:47.077
because he stuck
around to help me,

29:47.119 --> 29:48.704
and I somehow
managed to send

29:48.746 --> 29:50.748
Dixon's career
down the toilet.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.958
Well, you never did
anything bad to me.

29:52.999 --> 29:54.960
(chuckles)
I'm great.

29:55.001 --> 29:56.044
Why?

29:56.086 --> 29:56.962
What is going on?

29:57.003 --> 29:59.632
Why are you
doing that?

29:59.673 --> 30:01.300
Because I can afford
to keep them now.

30:01.341 --> 30:04.052
I just signed on to be
Teddy Montgomery's new beard.

30:04.094 --> 30:06.012
This world is
completely screwed up.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.473
I can't just go
back to Kansas

30:07.514 --> 30:09.433
and leave everything
this terrible.
What is

30:09.475 --> 30:10.976
so terrible about me
being in a relationship

30:11.017 --> 30:12.185
where I can't possibly get hurt

30:12.227 --> 30:14.563
and I get a new Mercedes?

30:14.605 --> 30:18.525
It's really hard
to explain, but

30:18.567 --> 30:22.070
I have a very strong sense
of how things could be

30:22.112 --> 30:24.197
and should be.

30:25.783 --> 30:27.701
When was the last time
you threw a party?

30:27.743 --> 30:31.913
I don't know.
My not-so-sweet 16 party.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.874
You should drink your tea.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.230
MAN:
Excuse me.
This came for you.

30:57.272 --> 30:59.316
Thanks.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.235
DIXON:
You can go, too,

31:02.277 --> 31:03.195
you know.

31:03.236 --> 31:05.405
I mean, everybody
else did

31:05.447 --> 31:08.575
soon as they found out that
I'm just some dork from Kansas.

31:09.451 --> 31:11.620
It's weird.

31:11.662 --> 31:14.080
Now that I know
you're actually uncool...

31:15.957 --> 31:17.917
...I kind of like you better.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.419
(chuckles)

31:19.461 --> 31:22.798
So, uh, what,
you didn't like me before?

31:22.840 --> 31:24.883
You were kind of a dick, man.
(chuckles)

31:24.924 --> 31:27.135
(doorbell rings)

31:27.177 --> 31:29.929
Yeah, you can go ahead
and get that yourself.

31:54.996 --> 31:56.915
Hey, man, thanks
for bailing me out.

31:56.956 --> 31:58.792
It wasn't
exactly my idea.

31:58.834 --> 32:00.377
Then, whose was it?

32:00.419 --> 32:02.379
She told me to
give you this.

32:09.135 --> 32:13.098
Welcome, everyone, to
Annie's good-bye party.

32:13.139 --> 32:14.600
I showed up just
to make sure she leaves.

32:14.641 --> 32:16.769
Yeah, me, too,

32:16.810 --> 32:19.563
well, even though you seem
like a very nice person.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.690
I just want to know if she's
gonna drop any more bombs.

32:21.732 --> 32:24.234
(chuckles)

32:24.276 --> 32:27.404
So, I am getting on a plane
back to Kansas tonight,

32:27.446 --> 32:30.657
but before I go,
I feel like I have to tell

32:30.699 --> 32:32.659
you guys something.

32:32.701 --> 32:34.703
I actually know all of you

32:34.745 --> 32:36.204
really well.

32:36.246 --> 32:37.539
You may not
believe that,

32:37.581 --> 32:39.374
but it's true.

32:39.416 --> 32:44.337
Naomi, you are supposed
to be obscenely rich.

32:44.379 --> 32:45.505
Damn straight.

32:45.547 --> 32:46.673
And I know

32:46.715 --> 32:49.551
you think you're supposed
to wind up with Teddy,

32:49.593 --> 32:50.761
but you both deserve

32:50.803 --> 32:53.555
something more, something real.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.768
And, Silver,

32:57.810 --> 33:00.061
if somebody had been around
to reach out to you,

33:00.103 --> 33:02.481
then maybe you wouldn't have
stayed such a colossal bitch.

33:02.522 --> 33:05.275
I know you're just trying
to protect yourself,

33:05.317 --> 33:08.654
but you really don't have
to be so alone.

33:08.695 --> 33:11.406
Dixon, you're right.

33:11.448 --> 33:13.492
We should have come
here as a family

33:13.533 --> 33:15.619
when we were
in high school.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.162
But we didn't.

33:17.203 --> 33:19.790
And you can't keep
pushing everybody away.

33:19.832 --> 33:22.208
You need to let
people care about you.

33:22.250 --> 33:25.671
Like Navid
and Adrianna.

33:25.712 --> 33:27.088
And me.

33:28.966 --> 33:33.094
We have all had
some really great times

33:33.136 --> 33:34.346
together.

33:34.387 --> 33:35.388
I guess, technically speaking,

33:35.430 --> 33:37.432
we haven't, but...

33:37.474 --> 33:40.560
I just see a lot of potential
here, you guys.

33:43.647 --> 33:46.650
Anyway, that's it,
so, uh, enjoy the party.

33:48.151 --> 33:49.194
(sighs)

33:49.235 --> 33:51.404
Well, you always knew
how to talk.

33:51.446 --> 33:55.450
I guess I've had a lot of
practice in the theater. Dixon,

33:55.492 --> 33:58.996
I'm really sorry I messed things
up for you so bad.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.664
And I'm especially sorry

34:00.706 --> 34:04.877
that going after my dreams
kept you from going after yours.

34:04.918 --> 34:09.840
Well, I guess my dreams weren't,
uh, meant to go that way.

34:15.971 --> 34:18.223
Welcome to the fallen
stars club.

34:18.264 --> 34:20.600
There aren't a lot
of perks here.

34:20.641 --> 34:24.646
Yeah. Initiation sucks.

34:25.647 --> 34:27.858
(Teddy clears throat)

34:27.900 --> 34:30.610
You know, the whole
arrangement thing...

34:30.652 --> 34:32.487
(sighs)

34:32.529 --> 34:35.072
I think maybe it's
not such a good idea.

34:37.116 --> 34:39.411
Yeah, probably not.

34:42.455 --> 34:43.623
Excuse me.

34:43.665 --> 34:45.500
I'm looking for Naomi Clark?

34:45.542 --> 34:47.085
That's me.
Um, I'm Max Miller.

34:47.126 --> 34:49.087
Someone called and recommended
that I meet with you.

34:49.128 --> 34:50.505
I'm looking
to buy some property,

34:50.547 --> 34:52.507
and I hear you're the best
in the business.

34:52.549 --> 34:54.634
It is a buyer's market,
Max Miller.

34:54.676 --> 34:57.804
Okay.

34:57.846 --> 35:00.181
Why do I feel like
I've met you before?

35:02.308 --> 35:04.436
Hey.

35:04.477 --> 35:06.229
Look, I know
you know I'm gay,

35:06.271 --> 35:08.857
so you might as well
just post it on your blog,

35:08.899 --> 35:11.693
or make some stupid TV show
about what a fraud I am.

35:11.735 --> 35:13.779
There's nothing I
can do to stop you.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.822
Teddy, I'm not going to lie.

35:15.864 --> 35:18.575
I think you should come out.

35:18.617 --> 35:21.494
But I'm not going
to be the one who outs you.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.038
You're not?

35:23.080 --> 35:24.497
No.

35:24.539 --> 35:28.752
I think I'm maybe going
to try a different approach

35:28.794 --> 35:30.336
to my journalism from now on.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.464
Little less evil.

35:32.505 --> 35:35.216
I just want to be more...

35:35.258 --> 35:39.054
true to who I actually am,
you know?

35:39.096 --> 35:41.807
Yeah, I think I do.

35:45.852 --> 35:47.646
ANNIE:
Hey!

35:47.687 --> 35:49.272
Are you leaving?

35:50.983 --> 35:53.068
Let me guess.
You're going to hit the road

35:53.110 --> 35:54.277
before your stepdad has a chance

35:54.319 --> 35:56.029
to cut you off
because of the arrest.

35:56.071 --> 35:58.615
You'll sleep in your car,
maybe pick up some work.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.951
You've always been pretty
good at building stuff.

36:00.993 --> 36:04.621
Okay, seriously, what are you,
like, psychic or something?

36:04.663 --> 36:07.124
Like I said, I just
feel like I know you.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.334
And I would hate to see
you isolate yourself.

36:09.375 --> 36:11.086
Whatever's going to happen
with your stepdad,

36:11.128 --> 36:13.839
don't you think it would be
easier with friends around?

36:15.256 --> 36:16.758
JASON:
Annie!

36:16.800 --> 36:18.802
I can't believe I
actually found you.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.386
Jason, what are you doing here?

36:20.428 --> 36:22.764
I saw your picture on
that horrible gossip blog.

36:22.806 --> 36:24.057
I was worried about you.

36:24.099 --> 36:26.518
Don't you think it's
time to come home?

36:26.559 --> 36:28.353
(laughter)

36:28.394 --> 36:30.396
ANNIE:
Um,

36:30.438 --> 36:34.192
Jason, you're a really
wonderful guy

36:34.233 --> 36:36.486
from what I can

36:36.528 --> 36:38.655
recall, and I know
this is gonna sound crazy,

36:38.697 --> 36:40.657
but...

36:40.699 --> 36:43.118
I feel like I already am home.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.787
LIAM:
Looks like
you're finally waking up.

36:53.753 --> 36:56.506
Looks like
you're finally waking up.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.550
Liam?

36:58.591 --> 36:59.926
Hey.

36:59.968 --> 37:02.095
It's good to have you back.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.265
(sighs)

37:11.354 --> 37:13.398
NAOMI:
So let me get this straight.

37:13.439 --> 37:15.400
In your dream,

37:15.441 --> 37:17.861
I was driving an economy car,

37:17.903 --> 37:19.863
and you didn't wake up
screaming?

37:19.905 --> 37:22.032
(laughs)
What is wrong
with you?

37:22.074 --> 37:23.241
It wasn't so bad.

37:23.282 --> 37:25.577
The most awful part was
that you were so determined

37:25.618 --> 37:26.953
to have this certain
kind of life

37:26.995 --> 37:29.455
that you were willing
to build it all around a lie.

37:29.497 --> 37:32.500
Yeah, well,
that's even more implausible.

37:32.542 --> 37:34.627
ANNIE:
I mean, I swear, it felt

37:34.669 --> 37:37.338
just as real as anything
that's ever happened.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.674
But certain things...
I mean, I should have

37:39.716 --> 37:41.593
known it was a dream.

37:41.634 --> 37:44.763
Like, in what reality would
Silver ever hurt her friends?

37:44.804 --> 37:47.515
I'm going to have to
check her dressing now.

37:56.816 --> 37:57.901
(sighs)

37:57.943 --> 37:59.027
I'll be back.

37:59.069 --> 38:01.154
There's something
I got to take care of.

38:01.196 --> 38:02.363
(sighs)

38:02.405 --> 38:03.949
Yeah. Me, too.

38:06.910 --> 38:08.870
Hey, Navid?

38:08.912 --> 38:10.038
Hey.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.249
About what I
said earlier...

38:12.290 --> 38:15.168
I'm not so fine by myself.

38:15.210 --> 38:18.088
You don't think I knew that?

38:23.718 --> 38:25.678
Adrianna?

38:25.720 --> 38:27.722
What are you
still doing here?

38:27.764 --> 38:29.474
Is Annie okay?

38:29.515 --> 38:33.937
Yeah, yeah, uh,
she's... she's fine.

38:33.979 --> 38:36.106
That's... that's great.

38:39.234 --> 38:40.610
Hey, Ade?

38:42.195 --> 38:44.948
Thank you for being here.

38:51.871 --> 38:53.372
(sighing)

38:53.414 --> 38:55.292
Hi.

38:55.333 --> 38:58.377
I'm Erin Silver. Um, I really
need to get my forms back.

38:58.419 --> 38:59.587
I made a big mistake.

38:59.629 --> 39:01.464
Oh, actually, yes,
there was a mistake.

39:01.506 --> 39:03.216
There was a signature
line left blank.

39:03.258 --> 39:05.051
That's why we
called the donor.

39:07.971 --> 39:09.388
You forged my signature?

39:09.430 --> 39:11.141
Teddy, I mean, I can explain.

39:11.183 --> 39:12.350
No.

39:12.391 --> 39:14.186
You can't.

39:14.227 --> 39:15.478
(slams door)

39:15.520 --> 39:18.148
(sighs)

39:28.950 --> 39:31.661
Damn it, Max.
Why aren't you in Iceland?

39:37.709 --> 39:39.878
Mr. and Mrs. Miller?

39:39.919 --> 39:41.587
Hi. It's Naomi.

39:41.629 --> 39:43.215
I'm sorry
to bother you so early.

39:43.256 --> 39:45.758
I'm just wondering
if you've maybe heard from...

39:47.093 --> 39:48.720
Max.

39:48.761 --> 39:50.513
You were supposed
to be in Iceland.

39:50.555 --> 39:52.057
Hey, Naomi.

39:54.475 --> 39:56.561
So you really
never left my side?

39:56.602 --> 40:00.315
How could I when I was the cause
of this whole thing?

40:00.357 --> 40:02.734
I'm never going to be able
to forgive myself.

40:02.775 --> 40:05.028
Liam, listen to me.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.239
This was not your fault.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.324
Wasn't my fault, either.

40:09.366 --> 40:11.910
Bad things are going
to happen in our lives.

40:11.951 --> 40:14.037
There's no way to prevent that.

40:14.079 --> 40:16.164
But the important thing is

40:16.206 --> 40:18.875
that we go through
these things together.

40:21.502 --> 40:23.922
I'm really glad
you're going to be okay.

40:23.963 --> 40:26.091
Me-- I am fine.

40:26.132 --> 40:28.301
But you--

40:28.343 --> 40:30.262
what you went through...

40:30.303 --> 40:32.180
I can't imagine.

40:32.222 --> 40:34.432
Are you sure
you're going to be okay?

40:36.268 --> 40:38.477
Yeah. Absolutely.

40:48.654 --> 40:50.573
Hey, moron?

40:50.615 --> 40:53.952
You can't be taking up
a whole space with that thing.

41:01.376 --> 41:04.087
Have a nice day.

41:04.129 --> 41:06.047
What the hell's
wrong with you?
