through the program data

on each show's average listener.

All right, let's see.

Well, actually, uh,
she's an older gentleman,

What?

01:08.800 --> 01:11.200
I'm sorry the station
spent its money on this nonsense,

01:11.500 --> 01:13.200

to increase your audience

Well, I thought we upped
the advertising budget for that reason.

I did, but I need some help.

You've seen the research.

My show is fine.

01:32.900 --> 01:36.100
That so-called research is nothing but
a bunch of confounded correlations

a certain image of me in her mind,

11:34.900 --> 11:36.900
These are my colleagues,
Ryan and Trent.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.800
Pleased to meet you.
We're very excited.

11:38.900 --> 11:40.300
FRASIER:
Likewise. Hello, Ryan.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.300
- Ten seconds, guys.
FRASIER: Ah, right.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.100
You know,
you may be surprised to learn

11:44.300 --> 11:45.700
that it was
not so very many years ago

11:46.000 --> 11:49.600
when I myself occupied
those tough years twixt 12 and 20.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.100
[CHUCKLES]

11:51.500 --> 11:53.000
Hi, and welcome to <i>Teen Scene,</i>

11:53.200 --> 11:55.000
Seattle's premier talk show
for young people.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.200
I'm Andy McNiff,
and for the next 60 minutes

11:57.500 --> 12:00.200
we'll be engaged in some straight talk
with our special guest.

12:00.500 --> 12:03.000
And here to get things rolling
is our <i>Teen Scene</i> panel,

12:03.300 --> 12:05.300
Trent, Ryan and Emily. Trent.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.400
Tonight we're talking
to Dr. Frasier Crane,

12:07.700 --> 12:10.200
a man who knows
what makes us tick.

12:10.500 --> 12:11.900
But what do we know about him?

12:12.200 --> 12:15.700
Dr. Crane, you're a popular psychiatrist
and radio personality.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.600
What would you say
is the secret of your success?

12:18.900 --> 12:21.200
I suppose it has something to do
with the fact

12:21.500 --> 12:25.000
that I am a good listener
and have a friendly voice,

12:25.400 --> 12:29.800
and I also try to pass along some
real psychological insight and advice.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.600
My research shows that your replies

12:31.900 --> 12:33.600
are typically
less than five minutes long.

12:33.800 --> 12:37.000
Doesn't seem like a lot of time
for substantive psychological advice.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.800
If I believe there's a real problem,
I refer the caller to...

12:40.000 --> 12:42.700
So if it's a real problem,
you pass the buck?

12:46.500 --> 12:48.900
- Excuse me?
RYAN: February 9th, 1993.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.600
Does that date
mean anything to you?

12:50.800 --> 12:52.500
- Should it?
- According to the <i>Boston Globe,</i>

12:52.800 --> 12:55.600
you spent two hours on a ledge
threatening to jump if your wife left.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.400
How many of your listeners are aware
that they're taking advice

12:58.700 --> 13:02.000
from a man who was nearly
a stain on the sidewalk?

13:04.400 --> 13:06.600
Andy, isn't it about time
for a commercial break?

13:06.900 --> 13:10.000
Actually, this show is a public service,
therefore commercial-free.

13:10.300 --> 13:11.900
[MOUTHS]
<i>Sorry.</i>

13:13.100 --> 13:14.300
Splendid.

[SIREN WAILS]

14:56.700 --> 14:58.900
Well, hi, Peg.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.600
Jeez, I didn't know you were
working the graveyard tonight.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.800
All this month.
What brings you here?

15:04.100 --> 15:05.500
Actually,
I was in the neighbourhood,

15:05.800 --> 15:08.200
and I wanted to make sure
they'd fixed that elevator camera.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.500
But, see,
I thought Rich was on tonight,

15:10.700 --> 15:14.000
which explains
why I didn't know you'd be here.

15:14.700 --> 15:15.900
Right.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.100
- Well, it's fixed.
- Well, that's good.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.000
Somebody broke it.

15:26.500 --> 15:27.700
Okay, then.

15:28.300 --> 15:30.500
- See you later.
- See you.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.400
Hey, how come
I never heard from you?

15:35.700 --> 15:36.700
Oh, jeez...

15:36.900 --> 15:39.400
Well, I was under the impression
we had some chemistry going.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.700
I think I deserved
at least a phone call.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.800
Hey, we made out a little.

15:44.100 --> 15:46.700
Let's not ruin it
by making it more than it was.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.400
- Just what I was thinking.
- Good.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.500
Then it won't be awkward or anything
if we pull the same shift, right?

15:53.800 --> 15:55.700
What are you talking about?
Don't worry about me.

15:55.900 --> 15:58.500
- Watch yourself. Heh.
- Ha-ha-ha. Okay.

15:58.700 --> 15:59.900
No worries.

16:01.600 --> 16:05.100
- So I'll see you around, then.
- Yeah, see you.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.500
Hey, you going
to Jerry's retirement party?

16:07.800 --> 16:10.900
- Uh, might drop in for a pop or two.
- Yeah, same.

16:11.100 --> 16:15.300
- Maybe I'll see you there.
- Yeah, maybe you will.

16:16.700 --> 16:18.400
[PEG CHUCKLES]

16:19.900 --> 16:23.800
Again, I freely admit
that I assisted my ex-wife

16:24.100 --> 16:27.400
in psychological experiments
on lab animals.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.600
However, at that time

16:30.800 --> 16:35.300
putting a pair of sunglasses on
a monkey did not constitute cruelty.

16:36.700 --> 16:37.900
We'll just agree to disagree.

16:38.100 --> 16:41.300
You know, I scarcely see how this line
of questioning about my personal life

16:41.600 --> 16:43.900
- can benefit your listeners.
- Well, Dr. Crane,

16:44.300 --> 16:46.800
every day you ask your listeners
to blindly trust you.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.900
Isn't the public entitled
to know a little more

16:49.100 --> 16:52.800
about that friendly voice
that seems to have all the answers?

16:54.900 --> 16:59.200
Oh, I understand.

16:59.600 --> 17:00.800
This isn't about me at all.

17:00.900 --> 17:03.000
You see, your combative
line of questioning

17:03.300 --> 17:04.800
is completely age-appropriate.

17:05.099 --> 17:08.099
The challenging of authority,
the zeal for truth.

17:08.400 --> 17:09.300
RYAN:
Speaking of truth,

17:09.599 --> 17:13.200
I have a few questions
about your last tax return.

17:14.300 --> 17:17.599
I hate to interrupt, panel, but it's time
for our regular news break.

17:17.900 --> 17:21.099
We'll be back with more
<i>Teen Scene</i> fun after this.

17:22.700 --> 17:26.099
Dr. Crane,
could I borrow you for a second?

17:27.400 --> 17:28.600
You're doing great.

17:31.600 --> 17:35.400
- Dude, you're in trouble here.
- Thanks for the update.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.900
Take it easy, Mr. Snappy.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.700
I'm here to help you.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.900
Can you believe
that Kirby guy works here?

17:42.100 --> 17:43.900
I can't believe
they finally graduated him.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.400
Remember, guys,
you're still goodwill ambassadors...

17:46.600 --> 17:48.300
We weren't talking to you.

17:49.100 --> 17:50.900
Okay.

17:53.400 --> 17:57.400
- Everything okay, Dr. Crane?
- Absolutely.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.800
I didn't fully appreciate the hard-hitting
nature of your journalism,

18:01.200 --> 18:03.000
but I think I know
how to handle it now.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.700
We're back with more <i>Teen Scene,</i>

18:05.000 --> 18:07.100
and our special guest,
Dr. Frasier Crane.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.600
Now, Dr. Crane, where were we?

18:09.800 --> 18:11.500
I believe we were discussing
my competence

18:11.800 --> 18:14.000
as a mental-health professional.

18:14.400 --> 18:17.900
And though it is true
that I have suffered

18:18.200 --> 18:20.800
several emotional setbacks
in my life,

18:21.200 --> 18:24.600
if we are to be honest,
haven't we all?

18:24.900 --> 18:26.900
And that's your defence?
That we all have problems?

18:27.200 --> 18:29.000
[ALL SCOFF]

18:30.100 --> 18:36.000
Perhaps I can better illustrate my point
by reading from a poem entitled:

18:36.400 --> 18:39.400
"An Onion for Trisha."

18:39.700 --> 18:40.800
Where did you get that?

18:41.000 --> 18:43.700
<i>My heart is like an onion</i>

18:44.300 --> 18:46.300
<i>Filled with layers of tears</i>

18:46.500 --> 18:50.200
<i>Why, oh, why did you leave me,</i>
<i>Trisha?</i>

18:50.500 --> 18:52.200
- Okay, give me that!
- Trisha Sharpe?

18:52.500 --> 18:54.000
You said you never liked her.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.000
Ooh, Trent, tough blow!

18:59.200 --> 19:01.500
Yes, it seems
that youthful relationships

19:01.800 --> 19:05.100
are fraught with emotional hazards.

19:05.500 --> 19:08.200
Especially in the case
of a young woman

19:08.500 --> 19:12.400
who finds her first love
at math camp.

19:13.800 --> 19:16.200
- What happened at math camp?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.800
- Uh, Dr. Crane...
- Yes, Ryan,

19:19.100 --> 19:21.700
or as the boys
on the swim team call you...

19:21.900 --> 19:25.500
So do you have any good advice
for kids that wanna go to college?

19:27.400 --> 19:29.800
As a matter of fact, I believe I do.

19:32.600 --> 19:36.400
In short, caller,
there is nothing wrong with you.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.600
And you're not going to get sick.

19:39.900 --> 19:43.400
But remember,
the more frequently you do it,

19:43.700 --> 19:46.500
the less special it becomes.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.100
I hope that answers your question.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.600
MAN [OVER PHONE]:
<i>Uh, yeah. Well, uh, thanks a lot.</i>

19:54.800 --> 19:58.200
Well, that about wraps it up
for tonight's <i>Teen Scene.</i>

19:58.500 --> 20:01.600
For Trent, Ryan and Emily,
this is Andy McNiff,

reminding you we're still taking
applications for the moderator's job,

20:07.200 --> 20:09.800
and wishing you a teen-tastic week.

20:10.100 --> 20:11.700
Good night.

20:11.900 --> 20:15.600
- Thanks, kids. I had fun.
- Yeah, thanks.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.600
Thank you. You made my month.

[CHUCKLES]

20:23.000 --> 20:26.900
Way to go, Dr. Crane!
That was sweet.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.900
I'm not exactly
proud of myself, Kirby.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.400
You should be, man.
Those dinks brought it on themselves.

20:31.700 --> 20:33.600
They were like,
"We're gonna get this old dude."

20:33.800 --> 20:36.700
And then you were like,
"Old dude? Say what?" And it was like:

20:36.900 --> 20:40.200
Wham! Wham! Smack-down!
Boom! Boom! Doc...

20:40.800 --> 20:43.300
Well said, Kirby. Uh...

20:44.000 --> 20:45.800
And thank you for helping me out.

20:46.100 --> 20:49.700
By the way,
how did you dig up all that stuff?

20:50.000 --> 20:54.400
Oh, let's just say I got a few
operatives who were, uh, held back.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.200
Ah. Heh-heh-heh.

20:56.300 --> 20:59.700
KIRBY: Hey, you know, why don't
you and I continue this conversation

21:00.100 --> 21:04.000
over a cheeseburger or some such?
