[woman] Bonjour, Mr. Laurent.

00:10.077 --> 00:12.444
It's Lindsey Johnson.
How are you?

00:12.446 --> 00:14.112
Ah, I'm glad to hear it.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.981
I was hoping
that our offer on your property

00:16.049 --> 00:17.583
was to your liking.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.218
Excellent.

00:20.287 --> 00:23.288
We're gonna build a beautiful
hotel together. Au revoir.

00:24.725 --> 00:27.058
[woman] Lin.

00:27.060 --> 00:29.060
Bagel with egg and cheese,
extra large coffee.

00:29.062 --> 00:32.731
-Welcome back.
-You are a lifesaver, Ellie.

00:32.799 --> 00:34.933
But I guess
you'll probably be in Paris.

00:35.002 --> 00:36.568
Yeah, I probably will be then.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.636
Let's do something fun tonight
now you're here for a minute.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.940
We could go to that new tapas
place and drink some wine.

00:42.008 --> 00:45.611
Or... I heard that the Met
is giving an after-hours talk

00:45.613 --> 00:48.246
on mid-century architecture.

00:48.315 --> 00:49.982
Any chance you wanna be my date?

00:50.050 --> 00:51.983
Dinner afterwards.
It will be my treat.

00:52.052 --> 00:55.453
If we can go to that sushi place
on 81st Street, then I am in.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.723
Oh, good. Done deal.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.993
-[Ellie] All right.
-I'll see you in there.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.762
[man] So, Ellie will take over
the Rosinksy estate in Boston,

01:03.830 --> 01:06.431
and Blake will handle
the Pinnacle Group project

01:06.500 --> 01:08.533
with New Zealand. Next!

01:08.636 --> 01:13.705
I wanna turn our attention
to a new opportunity. Ireland.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.173
As you all know,

01:15.242 --> 01:17.342
we've been looking to have
a presence there for years.

01:17.344 --> 01:19.511
I'm very interested
in a piece of land

01:19.513 --> 01:20.745
that's come to my attention.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.248
It's right on the coast,
here, in Kilabbey.

01:23.316 --> 01:25.651
The only problem is... Well...

01:26.553 --> 01:27.785
That castle.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.521
-Permitting nightmare?
-[man] If only.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.825
The town council
owns the property

01:32.893 --> 01:34.726
and they seem unwilling
to sell to anyone

01:34.795 --> 01:36.094
who wants
to take the castle down.

01:36.163 --> 01:38.697
The challenge
is to make the council see

01:38.765 --> 01:42.134
that selling to us,
and building something new,

01:42.202 --> 01:45.370
will ultimately benefit
the community.

01:46.173 --> 01:48.740
Lindsey? I'd like you to go.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.510
I'd be happy to, Mr. Krispen,

01:51.578 --> 01:53.745
but, um... I'm preparing
to go to Paris,

01:53.747 --> 01:55.880
continuing the negotiations
with the Laurents.

01:55.882 --> 01:59.684
Your level of experience
can help us win this one.

01:59.686 --> 02:03.055
-Hannah can cover Paris.
-I will start prepping.

02:08.095 --> 02:11.195
[laughter]

02:11.298 --> 02:12.764
[woman] She did so much.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.300
Don't...
Don't bring that up again!

02:15.369 --> 02:17.335
-No. That's not fair.
-[man] Remember last year?

02:17.437 --> 02:19.537
[woman] That's... No.
That's not fair.

02:19.539 --> 02:20.672
[laughter]

02:20.741 --> 02:22.207
[man] Oh, God,
she was a tragedy.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.909
Now, I don't want to hear
any whining and fighting

02:24.979 --> 02:28.279
about who teaches what and goes
where this year, all right?

02:28.282 --> 02:30.082
Well, it's about time
you get used to it, Alroy.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.884
You've only been running the
festival for, what, 30 years?

02:32.953 --> 02:34.686
It's a wonder
anyone gets a match

02:34.755 --> 02:36.588
-with the lot of you working it.
-Oh!

02:36.590 --> 02:38.624
All right, all right!
Now listen up.

02:38.725 --> 02:41.759
There's about to be 1,000 people
here in a few days,

02:41.829 --> 02:43.094
so let's get focused.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.730
-Maebh?
-Yes.

02:44.732 --> 02:47.132
You'll be teaching the afternoon
soda bread classes,

02:47.200 --> 02:49.834
and, Rory, you'll be helping
with the paddleboarding.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.137
And, Brennan,
you're still up for doing

02:52.205 --> 02:53.672
the Gaelic football lessons

02:53.740 --> 02:54.906
-and the hurdling?
-Mm-hmm.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.641
Maybe a field trip
to the cliffs?

02:56.643 --> 02:59.277
I'm up for it, if I can teach
a few ballads on the bus.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.279
-Oh, no, thank you.
-Oh.

03:01.281 --> 03:02.414
What if Rory sings with me?

03:02.416 --> 03:04.149
-No, not...
-[woman] Ah, go on.

03:04.217 --> 03:06.551
-[man] Come on.
-Not happening.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.720
But maybe Brennan
will céilí dance this year.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.923
-Oh, yeah, we've missed you.
-It's been too long.

03:10.991 --> 03:12.390
Not happening!

03:12.392 --> 03:13.892
[men laugh]

03:19.332 --> 03:21.867
Here we are.

03:21.935 --> 03:24.970
Not quite the night we had
envisioned but... you know.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.206
I'm sorry to change our plans,
Ellie.

03:27.274 --> 03:30.074
I am really excited
that you're going to Ireland.

03:30.144 --> 03:31.543
It's the most beautiful place,

03:31.545 --> 03:34.146
with all those
quaint little towns.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.882
Yeah.
Well, mine is about to put on

03:36.950 --> 03:38.049
a matchmaking festival.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.851
How about that for quaint?
[laughs]

03:39.920 --> 03:42.988
No! I bet you're gonna meet
so many single Irish men.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.724
And those accents?
I mean, come on.

03:45.792 --> 03:49.194
Yeah, just exactly what I'm
looking for on a business trip.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.463
Wait, wasn't your grandmother
from Ireland?

03:51.531 --> 03:53.165
Yeah. Good memory.

03:53.266 --> 03:54.766
Some tiny little town.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.434
This is her ring.

03:56.503 --> 03:58.670
I wish I asked my mom more
about her when I had the chance.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.872
My dad wasn't exactly
brimming with stories.

04:00.874 --> 04:03.608
I'm sure your mom would be
really happy you're going there.

04:03.677 --> 04:04.810
-Mm-hmm.
-Getting a sense

04:04.812 --> 04:05.844
of some of your ancestry.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.379
I think she would.

04:07.447 --> 04:09.014
I mean, if nothing else,
it'll be...

04:09.082 --> 04:10.148
Life-affirming.

04:10.150 --> 04:12.517
I was gonna say uneventful.

04:12.585 --> 04:15.921
Who knows? Maybe this trip
will be really meaningful.

04:23.997 --> 04:26.665
[Lindsey] Wow.
Are all the roads this windy?

04:26.733 --> 04:30.002
[man] Yep. Your first time
in the Emerald Isle?

04:30.070 --> 04:32.971
-I'm afraid so.
-I've lived here all my life.

04:32.973 --> 04:36.341
I can tell you, you won't find
a better spot in Ireland.

04:36.410 --> 04:39.511
[Lindsey] I'll have to take your
word for it, Conor. Wait! Stop!

05:32.699 --> 05:34.766
I'm sorry. I, um...

05:34.768 --> 05:37.001
I was just looking around.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.503
The castle's
not officially open,

05:38.572 --> 05:40.271
but I don't mind you looking
while I tidy up.

05:40.373 --> 05:42.774
It's a lot for one person
to tidy up.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.776
-Rather grand, isn't she?
-Yeah.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.745
Built in the 1300s
by the Ballydonal family.

05:47.815 --> 05:52.384
The last living member lived
here until... 50 years ago.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.986
After which he left
the entire place to the town.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.322
Lucky us.

Roisin Ballydonal? The founder
of the matchmaking festival.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.093
Someone's done her homework.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.429
Well, I'm nothing
if not well-researched.

06:04.431 --> 06:06.832
Then you'll know that she set up
the festival on the grounds here

06:06.900 --> 06:09.400
for the farmers to meet
young women in the spring.

06:09.402 --> 06:11.703
And the tradition stuck.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.005
So, um, why is there
nothing going on here

06:14.073 --> 06:15.239
for the festival right now?

06:15.309 --> 06:17.743
Oh, these days
we only use the house

06:17.811 --> 06:19.311
for the big party at the end.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.812
Don't wanna wear her out.

06:20.814 --> 06:23.014
-[clattering]
-Oh.

06:23.082 --> 06:24.783
We need to get that fixed.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.020
Among other things.

06:29.088 --> 06:31.122
Um... OK, well,
thank you so much.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.725
And I'm...
I'm sorry to interrupt.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.094

I'll let you get to it.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.496
Enjoy your stay.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.514
[Lindsey] OK.

06:59.118 --> 07:00.452
Thank you.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.193
You'll be in our back cottage.
It's lovely.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.795
You can hear the greenfinches
chirping in the morning.

07:10.864 --> 07:13.098
But we also have earplugs
in case you need them.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.900
Jetlag can be rough

07:14.968 --> 07:17.268
and we want our guests
feeling good for the festival.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.703
Oh, I'm not here
for the festival.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.773
I know, probably one of the only
people in town who isn't.

07:21.841 --> 07:23.741
I'm giving a presentation
to the council,

07:23.810 --> 07:25.444
which I should get to work on.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.212
There we go.

07:28.214 --> 07:30.114
Now, you're through
the back door and down the path.

07:30.183 --> 07:34.219
-Can I give you a hand?
-No, no, I've got it, thank you.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.888
[woman] It's official.
I brought way too many clothes.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.790
Well, I didn't bring enough,
so we'll share.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.392
I've got mine up for grabs, too.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.295
Hi! Aren't your sunnies cute?

07:43.363 --> 07:46.631
Oh, thank you. I got them
from a sample sale in New York.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.266
-You're from New York?
-Where are you from?

07:48.335 --> 07:51.203
Australia. Though we usually get
mistaken for New Zealanders.

I'm Charlotte.
This is Kylie and Olivia.

07:54.541 --> 07:56.908
-Hi.
-I'm Lindsey. Nice to meet you.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.044
We're going to the pub
for a bite to eat in a bit.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.512
-You want to join?
-Oh! I'd love to.

08:01.514 --> 08:04.182
But I have so much work to do,
and I wouldn't want to intrude.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.651
No, please. It's always more fun
with a fourth.

08:07.587 --> 08:09.454
Um... OK. Sure. Why not?

08:09.522 --> 08:11.389
-Let me go put my stuff down?
-Great.

08:11.458 --> 08:15.026
[Irish folk music, pub chatter]

08:15.128 --> 08:17.562
OK, so you fill out the
questionnaire, and then what?

08:17.631 --> 08:20.432
Well, the first few days,
we sign up for classes we want,

08:20.500 --> 08:24.436
like learning how to bake
barmbrack, or how to kite surf.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.838
The rest of the days,
you get assigned group outings,

08:26.907 --> 08:29.173
based on the questionnaire
you fill out.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.975
The hope is you find a match.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.778
OK. I don't mean
to sound like a skeptic,

08:33.847 --> 08:36.514
but do you really think
that hundreds of people

08:36.616 --> 08:38.983
are gonna leave here
with a soulmate next week?

08:39.086 --> 08:42.320
As we learned in Vegas,
anything's possible.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.322
-[all laugh]
-That's true.

08:44.391 --> 08:46.491
-You should come out with us.
-Mm-hmm.

08:46.559 --> 08:49.160
There's always gatherings
with live music and dancing.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.561
I would love to.

08:50.630 --> 08:53.965
That is if I'm not at the inn,
buried in paperwork.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.733
What kind of work do you do,
Lindsey?

08:55.802 --> 08:59.271
I am an acquisitions manager
for a hotel developer.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.973
My company's interested
in buying Ballydonal Castle

09:01.975 --> 09:03.841
and turning it into a resort.

09:03.910 --> 09:05.910
Wow. That's amazing.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.445
Acquisitions manager?

09:07.514 --> 09:10.281
I would have said more...
undercover agent.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.050
I've already met your friend
here, ladies.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.386
She decided to take
an uninvited snoop

09:14.487 --> 09:15.886
around her hopeful acquisition.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.655
I wasn't trying to be sneaky.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.525
I've done a lot of research
and I have a very good argument

09:20.527 --> 09:22.660
as to why my company
should acquire the castle.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.262
So you can raze it
to the ground?

09:24.331 --> 09:26.230
I prefer "fresh start."

09:26.232 --> 09:28.600
You're not the first person
to try and woo the council.

09:28.668 --> 09:31.503
You won't be the last,
no matter what your offer is.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.638
I'd be happy to take that bet.

his castle.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.997
-Do you help run the festival?
-Me, my mum and my dad.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.400
-Family tradition.
-Well, that's nice.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.268
You must be on the way
to the council meeting.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.536
I am.

10:38.538 --> 10:40.171
I hear they've a very busy
agenda today.

10:40.239 --> 10:42.941
You might be waiting a while.
Would you like a snack?

10:43.009 --> 10:45.210
No, I am fully stocked.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.045
Good luck, so.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.187
[gavel bangs]

10:56.255 --> 10:59.791
I call the council to order,
all members present.

10:59.859 --> 11:03.594
We have our weekly agenda
to get through

11:03.663 --> 11:06.664
before moving on
to a presentation from...

11:06.733 --> 11:09.501
Miss Lindsey Johnson, is it?

11:09.569 --> 11:11.135
Oh, um, I can...

11:11.238 --> 11:13.805
No, no, don't worry.
We'll get to you.

11:13.873 --> 11:17.909
First item on the agenda,
the McElroys' fence.

11:17.977 --> 11:21.179
Chewed through
by McDuffy's goat last week.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.047
Allegedly, Siobhan.

11:23.049 --> 11:24.749
Right, allegedly.

11:24.851 --> 11:28.820
Anyone capture any video
on their phones? No?

11:28.922 --> 11:30.254
We should really check. Rory.

11:30.256 --> 11:33.124
Do a quick search
over all social media.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.559
Hashtag Kilabbey, hashtag goat,

11:34.561 --> 11:36.861
hashtag fence, hashtag eat,
hashtag allegedly.

11:36.963 --> 11:39.531
Hashtag Kilabbey, hashtag fence,
hashtag goat,

11:39.599 --> 11:41.799
-hashtag...
-Allegedly.

11:41.801 --> 11:43.368
-Allegedly.
-Hashtag McDuffy.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.069
[gavel bangs]

11:45.071 --> 11:48.273
The Mahoneys would like a permit
for selling wind chimes

11:48.275 --> 11:49.908
at the spring farmers' market.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.343
Isn't that gonna make
an awful lot of noise?

11:52.412 --> 11:54.145
I like the sound of wind chimes.

11:54.213 --> 11:57.014
Ah, yes, so do I.
I think they're lovely.

11:57.083 --> 11:58.616
Before we decide,
I think it's imperative

11:58.618 --> 12:00.318
that we at least hear
one of these wind chimes.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.887
Mr. and Mrs. Mahoney,
did you bring one?

12:02.956 --> 12:04.255
-Will I go?
-Yes.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.490
[Lindsey sighs]

12:05.558 --> 12:06.958
[gavel bangs]

12:07.026 --> 12:10.261
So, that settles the matter
of the post office,

12:10.329 --> 12:14.232
which will be painted
eggshell white inside,

12:14.300 --> 12:15.600
not cream.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.602
Although we appreciate
the spirited arguments

12:17.670 --> 12:21.506
on behalf of ivory chiffon,
salty tear and whispering peach.

12:21.574 --> 12:25.643
That concludes
our weekly agenda.

12:25.712 --> 12:28.846
Oh! The floor is yours,
Miss Johnson.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.615
Thank you. And thank you so much
for having me.

12:31.685 --> 12:34.986
Now, I understand that the
castle is a beloved landmark,

12:35.054 --> 12:37.488
and integral
to your matchmaking festival.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.123
But we also understand

12:39.192 --> 12:40.892
that it's in need
of some major renovations,

12:40.960 --> 12:43.261
and that could be
prohibitively costly.

12:43.329 --> 12:46.097
So the Krispen Group
has a longstanding relationship

12:46.165 --> 12:48.466
for building exceptional hotels
around the world

12:48.535 --> 12:52.903
where we bring in sustainable,
year-long revenue

12:52.973 --> 12:54.538
to local economies.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.841
We would like to offer
a substantial sum

12:56.943 --> 12:59.310
to build a resort
on the Ballydonal property,

12:59.412 --> 13:03.748
allowing us to create
a new history for it, together.

13:03.817 --> 13:06.116
Excuse me, Miss Johnson.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.386
-May I interrupt you?
-Of course.

13:08.454 --> 13:13.758
Thank you for your interest,
and the detailed information.

13:13.826 --> 13:19.163
But I don't think that you can
be invested in our area

13:19.232 --> 13:20.431
as you don't know it.

13:20.499 --> 13:22.500
You've just arrived in Kilabbey,
haven't you?

13:22.569 --> 13:24.002
Yes, of course I have,

13:24.070 --> 13:25.737
but this is just the beginning
of the conversation.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.406
And if the council will let me
continue, I can show you--

13:28.474 --> 13:30.975
Thank you for your time,
Miss Johnson.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.977
But I speak
on behalf of all of us

13:33.046 --> 13:35.546
when I say we're not interested
in selling the land

13:35.548 --> 13:38.683
without an agreement
to keep the castle intact.

13:39.852 --> 13:41.920
We'll pass on the offer.

13:42.021 --> 13:44.355
-Meeting adjourned.
-[gavel bangs]

13:48.395 --> 13:50.728
I thought
you made a good effort in there.

13:50.797 --> 13:53.464
I didn't even get through the
first page of my presentation.

13:53.466 --> 13:54.732
I wouldn't take it personally.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.568
Us Irish,
we're a stubborn bunch.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.136
We don't give up things easily.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.338
Let's go and take care
of any late registrations,

14:00.406 --> 14:03.207
as people are still arriving
at the tent.

14:03.209 --> 14:05.777
You know what? I understand.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.945
I'm just going to have
to really show my investment.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.614
-How are you going to do that?
-Your head councilman was right.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.149
I only just got here.

14:12.151 --> 14:15.086
I did my research,
I've learned some Irish phrases,

14:15.088 --> 14:18.122
but I haven't really experienced
local culture.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.691
How can I say what's best
for the Ballydonal land

14:20.693 --> 14:23.127
if I haven't immersed myself
in Kilabbey?

14:23.196 --> 14:26.497
What better way to do that than
join the matchmaking festival?

14:26.499 --> 14:29.166
-Excuse me?
-Yeah, it's exactly what I need.

14:29.235 --> 14:33.504
Cooking classes, nature walks,
knitting.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.773
A week-long Irish event.

14:35.842 --> 14:37.541
The festival's open to everyone,
right?

14:37.610 --> 14:39.544
-Well, yeah.
-Great.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.580
I'm gonna go sign up.
I'm excited.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.853
[overlapping chatter]

14:49.956 --> 14:51.422
[Lindsey]
It's really my best angle.

14:51.524 --> 14:54.792
[Mr. Krispen]<i> By learning</i>
<i>how to make Irish stew?</i>

14:54.860 --> 14:58.296
Mr. Krispen, the council members
run the festival.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.131
If I take their classes

15:00.133 --> 15:03.600
and show them that I'm invested
in the area and the traditions,

15:03.670 --> 15:05.236
that I'm doing my homework,

15:05.305 --> 15:07.505
they can only recognize I'm
putting in the time and effort,

15:07.573 --> 15:09.807
and maybe then
they will reconsider our offer.

15:09.876 --> 15:13.311
Lindsey, I know that research
is your specialty.

15:13.379 --> 15:16.614
<i>You've always had very good</i>
<i>instincts about deals.</i>

15:16.616 --> 15:20.284
<i>-But this seems pretty...</i>
-Unorthodox?

15:20.353 --> 15:22.887
Yeah, I know. I know.
But they have to see me

15:22.955 --> 15:25.056
as something other
than a hotel developer.

15:25.124 --> 15:26.658
<i>And when they do, that's my in.</i>

15:26.726 --> 15:28.959
<i>That is when we bring them</i>
<i>to our side of things.</i>

15:29.028 --> 15:33.298
Mr. Krispen, I'm telling you,
this property is one of a kind.

15:33.366 --> 15:36.567
If you were here,
you would do the same thing.

15:36.569 --> 15:40.071
<i>-OK. Keep me updated.</i>
-OK, thanks.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.907
You mean the same woman from
the council meeting this morning

15:42.975 --> 15:44.441
is doing the festival?

15:44.511 --> 15:45.877
That's the one.

15:45.978 --> 15:47.745
Maybe she'll meet a nice bloke.

15:47.813 --> 15:50.047
I don't think that's her aim,
Rory.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.649
So what if she hangs out
for a week?

15:52.719 --> 15:54.785
She'll learn some kayaking,
eat some boxty,

15:54.787 --> 15:56.287
sing some Irish songs.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.356
Doesn't mean we have to sell
the land to her, does it?

15:58.424 --> 15:59.857
No, I suppose not.

15:59.925 --> 16:01.959
Who knows? Maybe she won't
even like the festival,

16:02.028 --> 16:03.361
head back to the States.

16:03.429 --> 16:05.596
This isn't exactly
New York City.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.666
We'll see how she gets on.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.372
[overlapping chatter]

16:14.440 --> 16:17.942
So in order to give our soda
bread that nice crumbly texture,

16:18.010 --> 16:21.045
we're going to incorporate
the butter in like this.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.814
We're getting right in there,
that's it. Gorgeous.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.583
Yes, right in there. Mix it.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.151
I've never had one of my guests

16:27.220 --> 16:28.619
bring their own
pastry cutter before.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.789
Oh, yeah, yeah. I, um...
I read that it helps,

16:31.857 --> 16:33.257
so my innkeeper
let me borrow it.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.027
I use the same methods
my grandmother used.

16:36.095 --> 16:38.462
And her grandmother before that.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.331
A fork usually suffices.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.301
Really are trying to impress,
aren't you?

16:44.370 --> 16:47.205
Are you...
Are you even allowed back there?

16:48.774 --> 16:50.841
I'm dropping off
some festival stuff for Maebh,

16:50.843 --> 16:53.210
and picking up
some chocolate biscuits.

16:53.212 --> 16:55.012
If you haven't checked out
their bakery display,

16:55.014 --> 16:57.681
it's really very impressive.
You're missing out.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.050
I highly recommend
the lemon tart.

17:00.052 --> 17:02.353
Thank you so much
for the recommendation.

17:11.263 --> 17:13.063
Good luck with the bread.

17:13.132 --> 17:17.135
Remember not to overknead it.
You probably already knew that.

17:20.239 --> 17:22.640
[Maebh] The color is just
beautiful on all of these.

17:22.642 --> 17:23.975
Do you mind if I try?

17:23.977 --> 17:26.243
This is gorgeous-looking,
this one. That's it.

17:26.245 --> 17:29.747
And when it's nice and warm as
well, cos then you've got...

17:29.849 --> 17:31.182
Mm.

17:33.953 --> 17:35.420
Not what you're used to?

17:36.789 --> 17:37.989
No, no, it's delicious.

17:37.991 --> 17:39.557
[chuckles]

17:41.895 --> 17:44.728
-[whistle blowing]
-[indistinct shouting]

17:44.797 --> 17:48.031
Remember, you can play the ball
on the ground and in the air!

17:48.134 --> 17:51.335
-[players chatting]
-Very good.

17:53.239 --> 17:56.007
One over two, right cross.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.643
Trust me...

17:59.979 --> 18:01.979
-[Brennan] Player.
-Out of my way.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.915
...you'll get into
the rhythm of the cable stitch.

18:04.984 --> 18:07.184
[whispers] Excuse me,
do you know what you're doing?

18:07.253 --> 18:10.388
-It's purl three.
-Right, purl three.

18:10.456 --> 18:12.657
[overlapping chatter]

18:13.893 --> 18:15.326
-[blows whistle]
-What?

18:15.394 --> 18:17.327
-Three to The Matchmakers!
-I must be doing purl two.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.297
She took the ball
and she put one hand...

18:19.365 --> 18:21.198
-You said that...
-Didn't see anything.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.633
Or five?

18:22.702 --> 18:24.168
Whatever this thing is,
she had her hands on it.

18:24.237 --> 18:26.437
It's a clear violation
according to what you taught me.

18:26.439 --> 18:29.173
I play by the rules.
And I'm an excellent study, sir.

18:29.242 --> 18:30.340
You're the one who taught me.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.809
There you go.
Abusing the referee.

18:31.878 --> 18:34.278
-Yellow card.
-Give me all your cards.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.547
Siobhan?

18:37.650 --> 18:40.417
Oh, that looks great.

18:40.486 --> 18:42.787
May be best if you start over.

18:44.057 --> 18:45.656
Right.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.092
Go, go, go!

18:48.160 --> 18:48.993
[players cheering]

18:49.095 --> 18:51.062
-No goal.
-Whoo! What?

18:51.064 --> 18:53.664
-No goal. Play on.
-That's three points!

18:57.870 --> 19:00.404
-Took too many steps.
-I didn't take too many steps!

19:00.473 --> 19:02.940
I put the ball on the stick
and the stick into the net.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.242
You are a little bit biased.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.777
-Took many steps.
-Three points to my team!

19:06.846 --> 19:08.746
Lindsey... go and have a coffee.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.615
Or go make some bread.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.884
Bye!

19:13.786 --> 19:15.419
[Lindsey] Fine.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.924
-[knock on door]
-Come in.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.563
-Fancy a biscuit?
-Ooh, yeah.

19:30.202 --> 19:31.569
Thank you.

19:31.637 --> 19:33.704
So, what's on the docket
for tomorrow?

19:33.706 --> 19:37.541
OK, kayaking in the morning,
then bo...

19:37.610 --> 19:40.377
-Bodhrán.
-...bodhrán drum after that,

19:40.446 --> 19:42.647
and then intro to Irish beer.

19:42.649 --> 19:45.316
I just really, really,
really hope

19:45.384 --> 19:47.718
that tomorrow runs smoother
than today.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.955
It can always be a little bumpy,
settling in. I remember.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.590
Seamus and I actually met at
the festival, a long time ago.

19:53.592 --> 19:54.658
In a cooking class.

19:54.660 --> 19:55.559
-Really?
-Yeah.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.261
Our pie turned out terrible,

19:57.329 --> 19:59.396
but we actually got something
out of it in the end.

19:59.398 --> 20:00.931
Yeah, I'd say.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.800
Are you going to stop by
the festival gathering tonight?

20:02.802 --> 20:05.536
Oh, no. No, I feel like
that's for people

20:05.605 --> 20:07.838
that are really trying
to find their match.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.808
No, it's for everyone.
Sure, Seamus and I even go,

20:10.810 --> 20:13.077
once he's done with
the dinner dishes. [chuckles]

20:13.079 --> 20:15.546
Look, it's one thing
reading about Ireland.

20:15.615 --> 20:18.783
It's another to actually get out
and experience it.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.791
-[Celtic fiddle playing]
-[door closes]

20:27.860 --> 20:30.427
[overlapping chatter]

20:30.496 --> 20:32.329
I hope we get some classes
together this week.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.232
Me, too. I'm trying to sign up
for as many things as I can.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.301
You should go paddleboarding
and bicycling

20:37.370 --> 20:38.603
if there's still spots.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.604
We went today
and it was a beaut.

20:40.673 --> 20:44.775
Although one of us did wipe out
with a gentle wave.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.377
[laughter]

20:46.379 --> 20:48.713
Luckily, our strapping
young instructor was there

20:48.814 --> 20:50.280
to help Olivia back up.

20:50.350 --> 20:53.050
He was very sweet about it.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.651
Watch us become
some of those ladies

20:54.653 --> 20:57.287
that come back every year
with matching T-shirts.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.790
You can stay at
the Ballydonal Resort and Spa.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.393
-That is, if it ever gets made.
-Here, here.

21:02.461 --> 21:04.995
-Cheers to the Ballydonal.
-To Ballydonal.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.664
Yes, indeed.

21:14.039 --> 21:17.941
She stayed for the entire class
although I barely helped her.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.977
I almost feel a bit bad
for the girl.

21:20.046 --> 21:23.080
Her soda bread looked like
it tasted awful.

21:23.082 --> 21:27.218
Well, that was me.
I may have added a bit of salt.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.887
-A lot, actually.
-[laughter]

21:29.955 --> 21:31.622
-You're terrible.
-I'm not terrible.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.492
I just want people to be at the
festival for the right reasons.

21:38.931 --> 21:42.632
-[mic feedback]
<i>-Tráthnóna maith.</i> [laughs]

21:42.702 --> 21:44.468
-Welcome to the festival.
-[people hushing]

21:44.570 --> 21:46.203
We're all very glad you're here.

21:46.272 --> 21:49.773
Now, we're going to start off
with a céilí dance,

21:49.842 --> 21:52.309
a traditional Irish folk dance.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.211
[loud cheering]

21:54.279 --> 21:57.181
[applause]

21:57.249 --> 21:59.916
[folk music playing]

21:59.986 --> 22:02.286
-I'm gonna go ask Rory to dance.
-Yes, you are.

22:02.354 --> 22:05.156
You, come with me. Come on!

22:06.659 --> 22:09.160
[clapping in time with music]

22:09.261 --> 22:10.895
[laughs]

22:19.004 --> 22:21.939
[cheering]

22:29.849 --> 22:33.517
[laughter]

22:40.259 --> 22:43.060
-Not feeling the music?
-I don't dance.

22:43.129 --> 22:44.428
I find that hard to believe

22:44.496 --> 22:46.363
based on your moves
with the broom.

22:48.734 --> 22:51.035
[clapping continues]

23:01.146 --> 23:02.646
[laughs]

23:12.358 --> 23:14.058
[cheering]

23:17.963 --> 23:19.563
[laughs]

23:24.236 --> 23:26.269
Welcome.

23:26.339 --> 23:27.471
I should be welcoming you.

23:27.540 --> 23:30.541
I thought you'd be
back in your room,

23:30.609 --> 23:32.910
studying for your classes
tomorrow.

23:33.012 --> 23:35.579
And miss this authentic
Irish tradition?

23:35.647 --> 23:37.881
No way. Oh!

23:37.950 --> 23:39.116
It's called having the craic.

23:39.185 --> 23:40.584
Didn't that come up
in your research?

23:40.652 --> 23:43.387
You know what?
I will crash and burn all week

23:43.489 --> 23:45.990
if it means I get another chance
to meet with everyone.

23:46.091 --> 23:48.726
I hope you won't leave here
disappointed.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.761
I usually don't.

23:51.864 --> 23:54.031
[music, clapping continue]

23:59.338 --> 24:02.940
Let me guess, you watched céilí
videos before you came over.

24:02.942 --> 24:06.577
Oh, no. This is all me.

24:06.645 --> 24:09.980
[cheering, whistling]

24:20.192 --> 24:22.493
[smooth Irish folk music]

24:23.796 --> 24:27.264
[Alroy talks indistinctly]

24:28.267 --> 24:30.500
[Alroy laughs]

24:30.502 --> 24:32.903
Mr. Sprows. Good morning.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.471
Ah, Ms. Johnson.

24:34.540 --> 24:37.808
I don't believe we've ever had a
presenter from a council meeting

24:37.877 --> 24:39.243
sign up for the festival.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.811
I took your advice to heart.

24:40.913 --> 24:43.780
It's important that I get
a good sense of the area.

24:43.782 --> 24:47.684
Yes, well, I hope you'll leave
with a good impression.

24:47.753 --> 24:49.887
I'm very excited to take
your class this morning.

24:49.955 --> 24:51.621
It's the first time
I've been kayaking.

24:51.724 --> 24:53.624
Oh, right. Yes, well...

24:53.692 --> 24:57.695
I don't seem to have you
on my list.

24:57.763 --> 25:00.631
-We must have overbooked...
-Overbooked?

25:00.699 --> 25:02.900
...which happens sometimes.

25:02.968 --> 25:05.469
Oh, yes, we like to rotate
now and then,

25:05.537 --> 25:07.671
you know,
keep things on the move.

25:07.740 --> 25:11.108
I'm sure Doyle O'Brien will
have you for his cooking class.

25:11.209 --> 25:14.511
OK. Maybe there's
another option.

25:14.580 --> 25:15.879
Clearly baking wasn't my thing.

25:15.948 --> 25:19.516
Oh, nonsense.
You'll be grand. [laughs]

25:21.687 --> 25:22.919
How are the numbers looking?

25:22.921 --> 25:24.721
Attendance is even higher
than last year.

25:24.723 --> 25:26.156
Oh, great.

25:26.224 --> 25:27.925
But Alroy's still going
to have to call a meeting

25:27.993 --> 25:29.559
after the festival.

25:29.561 --> 25:31.061
We'll have a deficit
in the town's operating budget

25:31.063 --> 25:32.563
and we need to make more cuts.

25:32.665 --> 25:34.899
We've made so many already.
Are you sure?

25:34.967 --> 25:38.102
We've been over the numbers
a million times.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.871
Everything just costs more
than it used to.

25:40.973 --> 25:44.975
I know we'd all like to fix up
part of the castle this year,

25:44.977 --> 25:47.111
but we can't even get to that.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.886
-I'm not much of a cook.
-You'll be great.

25:55.954 --> 25:58.388
-So, 11 o'clock sharp.
-OK, see you then.

25:58.457 --> 25:59.823
OK, bye-bye.

26:01.360 --> 26:04.027
All set, Dad? You need anything
before I head off?

26:04.030 --> 26:05.863
I've got an odd number again.

26:07.633 --> 26:11.702
Any way you can stay, partner up
with somebody for a bit?

26:11.770 --> 26:13.671
You'll get a free lunch
out of it.

26:14.573 --> 26:17.608
-Sure.
-Good man.

26:17.676 --> 26:21.044
My Irish stew is a little bit
different every time,

26:21.113 --> 26:23.314
based on what's in the garden.

26:23.382 --> 26:27.217
You've got your traditional
meat, onions, potatoes, carrots,

26:27.285 --> 26:32.489
but maybe I add a few cabbage
leaves, or some leeks.

26:32.558 --> 26:35.125
OK, let's get cracking.

26:37.330 --> 26:40.163
You know my dad isn't
on the town council.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.965
Yeah, I know.

26:42.034 --> 26:45.101
I was supposed to be in Alroy's
class, but it was overbooked.

26:45.171 --> 26:47.103
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

26:47.173 --> 26:50.073
No, I'm glad to be
in this class.

26:50.142 --> 26:53.810
It's good that I'm learning
a few authentic Irish recipes.

26:53.912 --> 26:56.280
I've got a little Irish in me.

26:56.348 --> 26:57.281
That explains it.

26:57.349 --> 26:59.149
-The stubbornness.
-[laughs]

27:00.986 --> 27:03.020
My 20-year-old whiskey will be
ready before this stew

27:03.088 --> 27:05.255
the way you're cutting that.
Do you want to switch?

27:05.257 --> 27:08.225
No, thank you, I'm good.
I gotta learn.

27:08.293 --> 27:11.828
The majority of my cooking
in the last few years

27:11.897 --> 27:14.898
has been in a microwave, so...

27:14.966 --> 27:17.234
All those fancy dinners
in New York?

27:17.236 --> 27:20.504
If you call eating takeout
at your desk fancy, then yes.

27:20.572 --> 27:23.374
-Depends on the desk, I guess.
-[laughs]

27:23.475 --> 27:28.178
Look, not everyone's dad has
a famous Irish stew.

27:28.247 --> 27:31.247
It's never too late to learn,
but I'm genuinely terrified

27:31.317 --> 27:33.149
at what you're doing
to that carrot.

27:33.151 --> 27:34.251
-Put it down.
-I'm peeling it.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.320
-Put it on the board.
-OK.

27:36.388 --> 27:38.488
I don't want you to lose your
fingers. So, knuckles there.

27:38.557 --> 27:40.257
-My knuckles?
-Yeah.

27:40.325 --> 27:41.859
Then press down.

27:43.695 --> 27:46.463
[indistinct chatter,
cutlery clinking]

27:46.532 --> 27:48.598
So, Lindsey, what's the verdict?

27:48.600 --> 27:50.234
It's delicious.

27:50.302 --> 27:51.635
And you said you couldn't cook.

27:51.637 --> 27:54.104
[laughs]
Well, I had a good partner.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.306
[scoffs]

27:56.308 --> 27:58.242
So, what brings everyone
to the festival this year?

27:58.244 --> 27:59.743
Uh, well, it's funny,

27:59.812 --> 28:02.245
Laura and I both came last year,
on our own,

28:02.314 --> 28:04.581
just looking to have
an adventure in Ireland.

28:04.650 --> 28:07.284
-And we found each other.
-What?

28:07.352 --> 28:10.787
Turns out we lived just
15 minutes apart in Chicago.

28:10.856 --> 28:14.391
We even went to the same gym,
but we'd never met.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.960
And actually we came back
this year to elope.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.028
-You don't say!
-What?

28:19.098 --> 28:21.798
-Congratulations!
-[laughter]

28:21.867 --> 28:24.735
You visit once and Ireland's
a hard place to forget.

28:24.803 --> 28:26.503
[Laura] It is. [giggles]

28:26.571 --> 28:27.771
So, how about you?

28:27.773 --> 28:29.239
Oh, um...

28:29.308 --> 28:33.644
Well, I... I came here
a week ago for business,

28:33.712 --> 28:37.648
and, um... I just decided
to stay.

28:37.716 --> 28:38.849
[laughs] So...

28:38.917 --> 28:40.583
Normally, when I travel,
it's for work,

28:40.686 --> 28:42.853
so there's not really time
for sightseeing or excursions.

28:42.921 --> 28:47.157
There's really not time
for anything, so...

28:47.159 --> 28:50.994
I don't know, this time,
I've been able to be here,

28:51.096 --> 28:54.964
and, um,
just get to know the people.

28:55.034 --> 28:57.735
It's... It has been really nice.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.608
[Alroy] Robin, meet Jenna.

29:04.676 --> 29:05.675
[knocks door]

29:05.677 --> 29:09.279
And Laela, meet Vlad.

29:09.348 --> 29:11.414
-Yeah, there we go.
-Sorry to interrupt, Alroy.

29:11.416 --> 29:12.949
Siobhan asked me
to get you to sign these.

29:13.018 --> 29:14.351
-Right.
-Orders to get the fence mended.

29:14.419 --> 29:16.954
-How are the activities going?
-Good.

29:19.157 --> 29:22.926
Are we going to have to sell
the castle, Alroy? And the land?

29:24.196 --> 29:26.396
Well, I don't know. Maybe.

29:26.398 --> 29:29.465
But I want to hold off on that
for as long as we can.

29:29.535 --> 29:34.137
I know Ms. Johnson is anxious
for us to change our minds.

29:34.240 --> 29:37.741
Well, she's more than welcome
to make us another offer,

29:37.743 --> 29:42.646
and we're more than welcome
to say no.

29:42.714 --> 29:46.583
The thing is, I'm finding it
difficult to get her a match.

29:46.651 --> 29:51.354
A match? For Lindsey? I don't
think she's expecting one.

29:51.456 --> 29:52.922
Everyone gets a match, Brennan.

29:52.924 --> 29:57.060
Of course, we know
that they don't always take.

29:58.063 --> 30:02.533
Perhaps the right person
will emerge.

30:04.369 --> 30:07.738
I wouldn't hold your breath.
Thanks.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.511
[children chatter]

30:18.050 --> 30:20.517
Well, if it isn't the guardian
of the castle.

30:20.586 --> 30:22.886
And if it isn't
the trespassing American.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.756
More of your Irish studies?

30:25.824 --> 30:27.924
No, your dad lent me this.

30:27.993 --> 30:31.161
I thought I'd copy a few recipes
down to make when I get home.

30:32.464 --> 30:34.064
More tidying up of the castle?

30:34.132 --> 30:37.467
I have quite a few things left
on my list before the party.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.569
-Need a hand?
-Is that a trick question?

30:39.637 --> 30:43.240
No. No, I would love to help.
I...

30:43.308 --> 30:45.609
Selfishly, I'd love
to see more of the castle.

30:45.611 --> 30:49.012
-I'd love a hand.
-OK.

30:50.548 --> 30:52.649
[gentle music]

30:53.719 --> 30:56.286
-You all right?
-Yeah. I'm good.

30:56.288 --> 30:57.487
Sure?
We can take a break if you want.

30:57.555 --> 31:01.158
-No, I'm fine.
-[clatters]

31:01.226 --> 31:02.692
We'll just add that to the list.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.494
-I'm sorry.
-It's OK.

31:10.336 --> 31:12.602
-Right, OK?
-Yeah.

31:12.671 --> 31:15.138
-Thank you.
-Of course.

31:17.009 --> 31:20.410
So, when you're not tending
to the castle,

31:20.479 --> 31:24.881
or the pub, or matters
of the town council...

31:24.950 --> 31:27.284
-I make whiskey.
-Oh.

31:27.352 --> 31:28.918
And that's it.

31:28.920 --> 31:31.354
I went to university
to study business,

31:31.356 --> 31:34.057
and then I came back to help
my mum and dad when I was done.

31:34.126 --> 31:36.893
Hmm. Have you always enjoyed
working with your family?

31:36.961 --> 31:41.264
I have. I've even brought in
some revolutionary ideas.

31:41.266 --> 31:43.066
They now take
credit card payments.

31:43.135 --> 31:44.735
[laughs]

31:44.836 --> 31:46.270
What about you?

31:46.338 --> 31:50.474
Have you always worked
for a fancy resort company?

31:50.542 --> 31:52.009
Shockingly, yes.

31:52.077 --> 31:54.377
I moved to New York City
after school

31:54.446 --> 31:55.678
to try and work at a museum

31:55.748 --> 31:58.248
because I studied
design and architecture,

31:58.350 --> 32:01.451
and I got a temp job
at The Krispen Group

32:01.453 --> 32:02.685
and I never left.

32:02.755 --> 32:05.555
Turns out I'm really good
at closing deals.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.125
So my life has become

32:09.127 --> 32:12.295
about landing one in every
major city in the world.

32:12.298 --> 32:14.164
Kilabbey must be high
on your list, so.

32:14.166 --> 32:16.800
-[chuckles]
-It is.

32:16.868 --> 32:20.637
This is one of the most
beautiful places I've ever seen.

32:22.074 --> 32:24.641
Do you want to see the best view
from this castle?

32:24.743 --> 32:26.009
Yes.

32:32.984 --> 32:34.885
I used to come up here
when I was a kid.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.552
Sneak up, keep an eye on things.

32:36.655 --> 32:39.322
So you've been guarding the
castle for quite some time now.

32:39.391 --> 32:41.324
Oh, yeah.

32:41.326 --> 32:43.560
I've had to let a couple
of things go over the years.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.763
Wild picnics.

32:46.865 --> 32:50.734
Rowdy and... sometimes
some nosy tourists.

32:52.071 --> 32:54.437
And a certain household neglect
that results

32:54.506 --> 32:58.274
-in disintegrating bannisters.
-Oh, gosh.

32:58.343 --> 33:00.544
I just hate the idea
of this all disappearing.

33:02.013 --> 33:03.780
All that history gone.

33:04.917 --> 33:06.249
You're connected to it.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.523
Well, I should get back to work,

33:13.592 --> 33:16.193
as much as I'd like to pretend
like I'm on vacation.

33:18.063 --> 33:19.229
Thanks for showing me this spot.

33:19.297 --> 33:20.764
You're welcome.
Thank you for your help.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.933
Next time, we'll rehang
all the chandeliers.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.835
You got it.

33:28.674 --> 33:31.608
[Ellie]<i> How's Operation</i>
<i>Charm The Town Council going?</i>

33:31.676 --> 33:34.644
[sighs] Honestly? I don't know.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.712
I haven't been spent any time
with the head councilman,

33:36.782 --> 33:38.248
but I am determined
to leave here

33:38.250 --> 33:40.250
with more than just
some conversational Irish

33:40.318 --> 33:41.752
and a bodhrán drum.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.286
<i>So that matchmaking festival</i>
<i>plan sounds perfect.</i>

33:43.388 --> 33:45.188
You can do research,
ask some questions,

33:45.190 --> 33:47.357
and maybe even meet
a cute Irish guy.

33:47.426 --> 33:49.725
<i>Wait, have you met</i>
<i>a cute Irish guy?</i>

33:49.795 --> 33:51.895
-No.
-[gasps] You totally have!

33:51.963 --> 33:53.263
Tell me everything.

33:53.265 --> 33:55.164
[sighs] As much as
you would like to picture

33:55.267 --> 33:57.801
some idyllic Irish romance
unfolding over here,

33:57.803 --> 33:59.269
nothing is happening, Ellie.

33:59.271 --> 34:00.470
[line beeps]

34:00.539 --> 34:01.938
Oh, you're getting saved
by another call.

34:02.007 --> 34:03.840
It's that UK company
that wants to collaborate

34:03.908 --> 34:05.875
on the Allen group,
or I would not be taking it.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.644
I'll talk to you later.

34:07.712 --> 34:09.179
<i>At which point you will spill</i>
<i>about what's really going on.</i>

34:09.281 --> 34:10.647
OK. [laughs]

34:20.425 --> 34:23.427
Great. Hi.

34:26.031 --> 34:28.665
Right, that's nearly everyone.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.400
We're just missing...

34:31.636 --> 34:33.503
Sorry. I'm late.

34:39.577 --> 34:41.611
Is, uh, this seat taken?

34:42.781 --> 34:45.549
-No, go ahead.
-Thanks.

34:51.022 --> 34:52.355
I hear
it's a bit of a long ride.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.757
Oh.

34:54.826 --> 34:57.693
I'd say we are in
for some rolling hills.

34:57.763 --> 35:01.164
You know, real kinda, like,
landscape, vista territory.

35:01.166 --> 35:02.432
I look forward to it.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.034
I mean, the greens here
are just...

35:04.102 --> 35:06.302
They're, like, richer
than you'd see anywhere else.

35:06.371 --> 35:08.638
-[door closes]
-I wonder how they irrigate it.

35:08.706 --> 35:10.006
-Me too.
-Yeah.

35:12.978 --> 35:14.144
What people don't realize

35:14.212 --> 35:17.714
is the mulch industry
is very competitive.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.082
Oh, I did not realize that.

35:19.150 --> 35:22.786
Oh, yeah.
Totally different than topsoil.

35:22.854 --> 35:24.554
-I'm glad I got in while I did.
-Yeah.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.590
[Brennan] Cliffs of Moher,
coming up ahead!

35:33.765 --> 35:35.732
-There we go.
-Thank you.

35:50.548 --> 35:53.316
You know we're at the "find your
match" portion of the festival?

35:54.786 --> 35:56.786
Just curious
as to why you came today.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.989
I wanted to see the cliffs.

36:00.526 --> 36:04.160
OK, so, aside from being
incredibly beautiful,

36:04.162 --> 36:05.895
tell me about them.

36:05.897 --> 36:08.798
There has to be some sort of
Irish folklore attached

36:08.800 --> 36:10.133
to a place this magical.

36:10.201 --> 36:12.102
Oh, yes.

36:12.170 --> 36:16.105
Legend has it that these cliffs
have a mystical power

36:16.107 --> 36:18.308
that attracts
every single American tourist.

36:18.376 --> 36:21.010
[laughs]

36:21.079 --> 36:25.815
So no pirates, mermaids
or star-crossed lovers?

36:26.618 --> 36:28.018
There is one.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.020
Woman named Mal.

36:31.089 --> 36:34.024
She was chasing
her one true love,

36:34.092 --> 36:36.192
the great warrior Cú Chulainn.

36:36.294 --> 36:39.128
Sadly, she couldn't catch him.

36:39.130 --> 36:41.565
Her sorrow was so great
that she turned to stone.

36:43.134 --> 36:47.737
If you look closely, you can
just make out her profile.

36:47.739 --> 36:52.776
Still staring out to sea,
watching, waiting for him.

36:53.979 --> 36:55.478
Is that true?

36:56.748 --> 36:58.682
A little bit yes,
a little bit no.

37:00.251 --> 37:04.020
Oh, guys, I remembered from
earlier it's really important

37:04.088 --> 37:06.489
you invest in the right kind
of product if you're gonna...

37:06.558 --> 37:09.225
Would you like a photo
with your seat-mate?

37:09.293 --> 37:10.927
Who, Grant the mulch guy?

37:13.799 --> 37:15.665
Nah. Since we're soulmates

37:15.733 --> 37:18.668
and we're gonna be together
for the rest of our lives...

37:18.770 --> 37:21.004
we can wait
till the next photo op.

37:21.673 --> 37:22.806
Fair enough.

37:26.110 --> 37:28.745
So, does Alroy
tell you the matches?

37:28.813 --> 37:31.648
Oh, no. Only Alroy knows.

37:31.716 --> 37:35.452
Sometimes they don't work out.
Things get criss-crossed.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.122
Wait, were you ever matched?

37:39.190 --> 37:43.593
Yes, I was, actually.
I was even engaged.

37:45.196 --> 37:47.564
But it didn't work out.

37:47.632 --> 37:50.766
I thought she wanted to
stay in Ireland, but she didn't.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.569
I'm sorry.

37:53.571 --> 37:55.438
It's OK.

37:55.507 --> 37:58.942
I'm quite happy to hang back
and to facilitate.

37:59.010 --> 38:01.378
Actually, you get quite good
at your own predictions.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.047
That couple there.

38:06.118 --> 38:10.286
She's gonna touch his hand
right about... now.

38:12.357 --> 38:14.324
You're good.

38:14.425 --> 38:16.926
Um, OK... What about them?

38:17.028 --> 38:20.630
So, the website is mulch.co.uk,
which I know sounds basic...

38:20.632 --> 38:24.934
They... are really
hitting it off.

38:24.936 --> 38:26.302
Except for Grant.

38:26.371 --> 38:28.805
Oh. And what about Grant?

38:28.873 --> 38:31.073
-Grant is going to be alone.
-[laughs]

38:31.176 --> 38:33.343
Till he works
on his conversation skills.

38:35.947 --> 38:37.781
Can I show you my favorite spot?

38:37.783 --> 38:39.683
Yeah.

38:41.119 --> 38:43.586
[seagulls squawk]

38:50.162 --> 38:51.761
-Hey, Da.
-Hey.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.196
I'm almost done here,

38:53.198 --> 38:54.731
then I can help
with prep for the dinner rush.

38:54.799 --> 38:57.200
No need. Your mam came in early
to get a head start.

38:57.268 --> 38:59.235
You know this week
is like Christmas for her

38:59.303 --> 39:00.570
with all the guests coming in.

39:00.572 --> 39:02.438
She should enjoy the crowds
while they last.

39:02.540 --> 39:03.973
Yeah.

39:03.975 --> 39:06.976
Oh... Tom Murray stopped by
yesterday,

39:07.045 --> 39:08.310
said you weren't interested

39:08.380 --> 39:10.113
in expanding the whiskey venture
with him.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.547
We've been through this.

39:11.616 --> 39:13.683
I'm happy doing
the smaller batches for the pub.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.885
I've enough to focus on
for the rest of the year.

39:15.953 --> 39:17.620
I don't have the time.

39:17.689 --> 39:20.156
You know, we could manage if
you were out a few days a week.

39:20.225 --> 39:21.991
I appreciate that.

39:23.061 --> 39:24.928
But I'm all right, really.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.656
[noisy chatter]

40:02.434 --> 40:04.066
Hi.

40:04.135 --> 40:05.835
I was wondering
if you might stop by.

40:05.837 --> 40:08.571
Yeah, well, I was out for
a walk and I heard some music.

40:09.775 --> 40:12.809
-Is it like this every day?
-Day and night.

40:12.811 --> 40:15.010
It seems
like you could use a hand.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.780
Wanna jump behind the bar?

40:17.849 --> 40:20.049
-Yeah.
-All right.

40:20.118 --> 40:22.318
-Come on, so.
-[chuckles]

40:25.323 --> 40:27.423
-Cheers.
-Thank you.

40:28.559 --> 40:29.425
Two for you now?

40:29.494 --> 40:32.161
Aren't you a love to help us.

40:32.163 --> 40:33.896
Well, I don't know
how qualified I am,

40:33.965 --> 40:35.631
but I'm happy to be of service.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.366
Your whiskey is so popular.

40:37.368 --> 40:39.235
People come from
all over the coast

40:39.304 --> 40:41.237
to taste Brennan's house blend.

40:41.305 --> 40:43.873
Oh, is that right?
It's just a hobby.

40:43.941 --> 40:46.009
Suddenly so modest, this one.

40:47.279 --> 40:49.479
I hope you know you'll be
helping yourself

40:49.581 --> 40:51.114
to dinner and dessert tonight.

40:51.182 --> 40:52.949
Oh, no, Nora, I can't do that.

40:53.017 --> 40:54.483
And they'll have it.

40:54.552 --> 40:57.753
You'll hurt my mam's feelings
if you don't say yes.

40:57.822 --> 40:59.022
I see they've turned Ms. Johnson

40:59.024 --> 41:00.924
into a regular employee
up there.

41:00.992 --> 41:04.660
Oh, is that so? [chuckles]

41:04.729 --> 41:06.929
She's been a good guest
the last few days, Alroy.

41:06.998 --> 41:08.597
I'm willing to be
as welcoming to her

41:08.599 --> 41:10.200
as we are to
the rest of the group.

41:17.742 --> 41:20.843
Well, it's customary
to have a whiskey lesson

41:20.912 --> 41:22.011
before you start serving it.

41:22.079 --> 41:23.579
Mm-hm.

41:23.648 --> 41:25.481
Maybe we can
make up for that now

41:25.583 --> 41:28.218
with a little... tasting.

41:29.854 --> 41:32.388
Why don't I just try
some of yours?

41:41.333 --> 41:42.632
Whoo!

41:43.635 --> 41:47.236
OK...
that's a little strong for me.

41:47.305 --> 41:48.504
[they laugh]

41:48.506 --> 41:51.374
Hold on.
We'll find you the right one.

41:53.979 --> 41:55.945
So, how did you
get into whiskey anyway?

41:56.014 --> 41:59.782
It's in the blood.
This pub is an old distillery.

41:59.851 --> 42:01.417
Halfway between
Belfast and Cork.

42:01.485 --> 42:03.218
A place where a weary traveler
could come

42:03.288 --> 42:07.056
and have a glass of something
to warm their bones.

42:07.058 --> 42:11.093
And personally,
I quite like the process.

42:11.095 --> 42:13.997
We age our whiskey
for a minimum of eight years,

42:14.065 --> 42:16.566
so you have to be patient.

42:16.634 --> 42:19.501
And when you do
come back to it...

42:19.571 --> 42:21.571
...it's like meeting up
with an old friend.

42:21.639 --> 42:23.139
Worth the wait.

42:29.581 --> 42:34.417
Mm. I'm getting... fruit?

42:34.986 --> 42:36.619
-Yep.
-Yeah?

42:36.687 --> 42:39.722
More delicate. It's a newer
blend from a sherry cask.

42:43.027 --> 42:44.360
-Let's try one more.
-OK.

42:55.807 --> 42:59.709
Mm. This is my favorite.

42:59.711 --> 43:04.180
It's...
It's sweet and... smooth.

43:06.851 --> 43:08.518
My very first batch.

43:11.189 --> 43:12.922
What happens
when you run out of it?

43:12.924 --> 43:16.659
You have a toast,
sing a couple of old folk songs.

43:17.829 --> 43:19.395
Only fitting.

43:19.464 --> 43:21.997
I like that there's
a history to it.

43:22.067 --> 43:25.234
A beginning, middle, and end.

43:27.238 --> 43:29.972
-You should bartend more often.
-[they laugh]

43:30.041 --> 43:31.174
Maybe so.

43:32.310 --> 43:34.209
[Nora]
A hand with the dishes, Brennan?

43:34.279 --> 43:35.712
Yeah, be right there.

43:38.883 --> 43:42.218
Enjoy that. You earned it.

43:50.928 --> 43:53.096
<i>Oíche mhaith.</i>

43:53.164 --> 43:54.831
<i>Oíche mhaith.</i>

44:03.141 --> 44:05.508
[seagulls squawking]

44:05.576 --> 44:08.377
I think the coffee shop's
around the corner.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.713
Oh, I forgot they're doing
speed dating this morning.

44:10.781 --> 44:14.083
Oh, my God, you guys,
we totally have to jump in.

44:14.152 --> 44:15.718
Oh, no, no. You girls go ahead.

44:15.786 --> 44:17.653
I have to go to the council
office to make an appointment.

44:17.722 --> 44:20.923
Oh, no, no, no. Come with us.
It'll be fast and fun.

44:24.496 --> 44:26.962
OK. OK, why not?

44:26.964 --> 44:28.264
[giggles]

44:28.332 --> 44:31.767
Then there's video games,
and football,

44:31.769 --> 44:33.969
and obviously water sports.

44:33.971 --> 44:36.205
-I collect vintage trains.
-Oh.

44:36.307 --> 44:39.475
That is a lot of interests.
[laughs]

44:39.544 --> 44:41.477
Um, well, my name's Lindsey
and, um...

44:41.479 --> 44:42.945
[bell rings]

44:43.014 --> 44:44.247
[man] Next circle!

44:46.084 --> 44:48.250
I think you should
talk about your dachshunds.

44:48.252 --> 44:50.853
But maybe about what you like
to do with them, activity wise.

44:50.922 --> 44:52.488
Give people
a better sense of you.

44:52.557 --> 44:53.922
Do you think I messed up
earlier?

44:53.992 --> 44:55.858
I did get carried away
about naming them.

44:55.927 --> 44:59.662
-Not at all. You're doing great.
-[bell rings]

45:03.535 --> 45:05.134
I didn't take you
as a speed dater.

45:05.203 --> 45:07.537
-Mm. You either.
-I'm not.

45:07.605 --> 45:09.338
I'm here this morning
as a coach.

45:09.407 --> 45:11.006
-Gentle words of encouragement.
-Yeah.

45:11.075 --> 45:13.375
Well, I hope you're a better
coach at this than hurling.

45:13.444 --> 45:15.545
I sincerely hope
you're better at flirting

45:15.613 --> 45:17.714
than you are at hurling.

45:17.782 --> 45:19.715
Well, we have
about 45 seconds left.

45:19.783 --> 45:23.553
Do you want to tell me
about bad habits, deal breakers?

45:23.621 --> 45:26.355
Deal breakers? This is moving
really fast for me.

45:26.357 --> 45:29.358
When you only have one minute,
you've gotta double down.

45:29.427 --> 45:31.360
OK, um... deal breakers.

45:33.597 --> 45:37.233
-Bad dancers.
-[they laugh]

45:39.103 --> 45:41.003
Oh. Oh, no.

45:46.878 --> 45:48.844
-Let's make a run for it.
-No, we can't.

45:48.913 --> 45:50.580
Uh, yes, we can.

45:54.151 --> 45:55.718
[bell rings]

45:56.554 --> 45:57.886
[they laugh]

45:57.955 --> 46:00.389
Thank you so "mulch"
for doing that.

46:00.458 --> 46:02.291
I couldn't put you
through that again.

46:02.360 --> 46:03.859
-No.
-Consider it a public service.

46:03.928 --> 46:05.761
Although we did leave
a lot of people to suffer.

46:05.830 --> 46:07.129
We did.

46:07.131 --> 46:08.364
I thought it was
"mulch" more important

46:08.432 --> 46:10.933
-that we got you away.
-[laughs]

46:12.603 --> 46:15.004
Would you like to join me
on an errand?

46:16.975 --> 46:18.440
Yeah.

46:18.509 --> 46:20.409
[bell rings]

46:28.386 --> 46:30.352
So, how much whiskey
will this make?

46:30.354 --> 46:32.721
Uh, enough. I'm not so precise.

46:32.824 --> 46:34.524
[chuckles] Fair enough.

46:35.759 --> 46:36.692
Hey.

46:36.760 --> 46:38.494
Need a hand, Brennan?

46:38.562 --> 46:41.764
Oh, no, I'm grand, thanks,
Aoife. I have a helper today.

46:43.868 --> 46:45.902
Aoife's great.

46:45.970 --> 46:47.336
When she's not working
on the farm,

46:47.405 --> 46:49.104
she does work
for the National Archives.

46:49.106 --> 46:52.909
She set up a whole database
for small town records.

46:54.612 --> 46:56.512
Do you think she could
help me with something?

46:56.580 --> 46:58.047
Of course.

46:59.883 --> 47:04.920
Hmm. Nothing's coming up
for Ina Muireann Duffy.

47:04.922 --> 47:07.489
You said she would have
been born about 1920?

47:07.558 --> 47:09.325
Yeah.

47:09.327 --> 47:10.793
I'm not seeing anything.

47:12.563 --> 47:15.364
Let's try<i> Agnes</i>
as the first name.

47:15.433 --> 47:18.401
It's another form of Ina
here in Ireland.

47:18.502 --> 47:23.339
Bingo! This looks like her.
Born 1921 in Glendalough.

47:23.407 --> 47:25.741
I'm guessing this is
her childhood address.

47:25.743 --> 47:28.310
Not far away,
just over the hill, I'd say.

47:28.379 --> 47:30.112
Do you think there's
any chance that we could...

47:30.180 --> 47:32.515
Go there immediately?
Definitely happening.

47:32.583 --> 47:34.216
[laughs]

47:34.218 --> 47:36.018
Thank you so much.

47:40.090 --> 47:43.759
[Brennan] Now... should be...

47:45.663 --> 47:47.663
[Brennan] ...just here,
after the church.

47:50.368 --> 47:51.633
Are you sure this is right?

47:51.703 --> 47:53.669
This is where the house
is supposed to be?

47:53.738 --> 47:55.338
I believe so.

47:57.241 --> 47:58.641
This is it.

48:00.278 --> 48:03.712
-Must have been torn down.
-So sorry, Lindsey.

48:03.781 --> 48:05.481
I didn't know.

48:05.549 --> 48:07.917
It's not...
it's not your fault.

48:10.154 --> 48:11.420
I'm glad we came.

48:13.024 --> 48:15.190
-We can go back now.
-No.

48:16.594 --> 48:21.163
Well, her house may be gone.
You can see where she's from.

48:21.232 --> 48:23.399
Why don't we walk
where she would have?

48:27.004 --> 48:29.905
This is officially what we call
in Ireland a soft day.

48:30.008 --> 48:32.474
[Lindsey laughs]

48:32.543 --> 48:36.412
This area was founded in
the sixth century by St. Kevin.

48:36.414 --> 48:39.115
There's history everywhere
you step foot.

48:40.518 --> 48:41.817
He was a hermit.

48:41.919 --> 48:43.619
Legend has it that he was
so at one with nature,

48:43.687 --> 48:47.957
so at peace with himself,
that when he would meditate...

48:48.025 --> 48:49.759
...he'd put his hands out,
and he'd be so still

48:49.827 --> 48:52.261
that once a bird came,
landed in his hand

48:52.329 --> 48:54.062
and made a nest.

48:54.132 --> 48:55.964
He lived till he was 120.

48:55.966 --> 48:57.300
Is that true?

48:58.169 --> 48:59.535
Little bit yes, little bit no.

48:59.637 --> 49:02.138
[chuckles]

49:02.206 --> 49:04.573
There's a place you should see
that way.

49:08.345 --> 49:11.981
I imagine her walking
on this exact same path.

49:12.850 --> 49:13.983
Oh!

49:14.051 --> 49:16.652
And maybe tripping
on that exact same spot.

49:16.720 --> 49:18.887
-Are you OK?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

49:18.990 --> 49:21.123
I'm so jealous
of all this beauty

49:21.192 --> 49:22.724
that she got to see every day.

49:22.794 --> 49:25.461
The most greenery I see
is a succulent.

49:25.463 --> 49:27.396
Probably going to be dead
when I get home.

49:27.464 --> 49:29.365
[chuckles]

49:29.433 --> 49:32.267
So you didn't get any tips
from Grant, then?

49:32.269 --> 49:33.569
You think he'll give me
a discount

49:33.637 --> 49:35.171
on one of those window boxes?

49:35.272 --> 49:37.239
Pretty sure he'd give you
plenty of things for free.

49:37.341 --> 49:38.640
[both laugh]

49:38.709 --> 49:40.576
You know, we aren't too far
from the ocean.

49:42.847 --> 49:45.714
How many hotels do you think
you've built around the world?

49:45.783 --> 49:50.119
I don't know. Maybe 50?
A hundred?

49:50.921 --> 49:53.889
Well, is it 50 or 100?

49:53.957 --> 49:56.392
Well, it's not like
I built them myself.

49:56.460 --> 49:57.693
I just manage the acquisition,

49:57.695 --> 49:59.528
then move on
to the next project.

49:59.597 --> 50:00.930
Ah.

50:01.966 --> 50:03.332
What about you?

50:03.334 --> 50:05.701
How many batches of whiskey
have you made?

50:05.703 --> 50:08.270
Hundreds. Thousands.

50:08.338 --> 50:11.673
Well, what is it?
Hundreds or thousands?

50:11.742 --> 50:14.210
The one that makes me
sound less like a fanatic.

50:16.414 --> 50:19.181
Why don't you make that
your main gig?

50:19.250 --> 50:23.552
I mean, the demand's there.
And you seem to love it.

50:23.554 --> 50:26.722
Ah, it'd be too expensive
and time-consuming.

50:27.558 --> 50:30.292
I like my set-up now.

50:30.394 --> 50:33.829
Besides, things get less fun
when they get so official.

50:34.932 --> 50:38.333
My job's official. I have fun.

50:38.402 --> 50:40.569
OK, well,
not all parts of it are fun,

50:40.671 --> 50:45.507
but it would be nice to
be more a part of the process,

50:45.576 --> 50:46.942
stay in one place long enough

50:47.010 --> 50:49.612
to see a hotel be built
from start to finish.

50:50.614 --> 50:52.815
Beginning, middle and end.

50:55.319 --> 50:57.586
Well, for what it's worth,

50:57.655 --> 50:59.321
I think you'd be
really great at it.

51:05.863 --> 51:08.163
-[knock at door]
-[Alroy] Come in.

51:08.232 --> 51:09.632
Ah, Ms. Johnson.

51:10.734 --> 51:12.301
I hope I'm not interrupting.

51:16.340 --> 51:19.341
Well, I think I know
why you're here.

51:19.410 --> 51:22.278
I'd like to request a spot
at Saturday's council meeting.

51:22.346 --> 51:24.113
I'd be grateful for 15 minutes

51:24.181 --> 51:25.481
with time for questions after.

51:25.549 --> 51:28.150
So you're going to give us
another presentation?

51:28.218 --> 51:30.686
I've made several changes
to the proposal

51:30.754 --> 51:33.488
and I really hope
that you give me another chance.

51:33.490 --> 51:35.724
Would you like to come
for a little walk?

51:36.793 --> 51:37.759
Sure.

51:37.828 --> 51:41.931
My late wife was
an American too.

51:41.999 --> 51:43.732
Very pragmatic.

51:43.801 --> 51:46.302
She could make
a convincing argument,

51:46.370 --> 51:47.903
just like you.

51:47.905 --> 51:50.372
Is it hard doing the festival
without her?

51:51.576 --> 51:53.775
I look forward to it every year.

51:53.877 --> 51:55.844
Which is what she would want.

51:55.846 --> 51:59.214
Oh, she loved Ballydonal Castle.

51:59.216 --> 52:02.851
But if she were here right now,
she would tell me to sell it.

52:02.920 --> 52:03.986
Really?

52:04.088 --> 52:05.921
Yes, she'd say
it's a lucrative deal,

52:05.989 --> 52:07.823
could take care of the town
for years.

52:07.825 --> 52:11.327
No more stress making cuts,
trying to fill deficits,

52:11.428 --> 52:13.895
worries about falling behind.

52:13.965 --> 52:15.197
At the end of the day,

52:15.265 --> 52:17.566
it's a building
we're talking about.

52:17.635 --> 52:19.467
She would just want to make sure

52:19.537 --> 52:22.638
that we were selling it
to the right person.

52:25.409 --> 52:27.176
I understand.

52:27.244 --> 52:31.680
We're no closer
to restoring the castle

52:31.749 --> 52:33.182
and I'm not getting any younger

52:33.250 --> 52:36.451
to try and find a way
to save it.

52:36.453 --> 52:40.389
So, let's talk exactly

52:40.457 --> 52:43.025
about what a sale would entail.

52:48.832 --> 52:51.099
don't want them
<i>to sell us the castle?</i>

52:51.168 --> 52:53.335
Of course I want them
to sell us the castle.

52:53.404 --> 52:55.003
And the town needs the money.

52:55.072 --> 52:58.473
But if Alroy convinces the
council to go through with this,

52:58.542 --> 53:00.576
I'm going to be responsible
for taking down

53:00.644 --> 53:01.777
an irreplaceable landmark

53:01.779 --> 53:03.312
that so many people
are attached to,

53:03.414 --> 53:05.914
and some people's livelihoods
depend on,

53:05.983 --> 53:08.751
like I'm some evil villain.

53:08.819 --> 53:10.386
And Brennan may never
talk to me again.

53:10.454 --> 53:13.122
Oh, dreamy Irish guy.
There is that.

53:13.190 --> 53:15.491
Just tell me that this is my job
and I'm doing my job

53:15.559 --> 53:16.959
and everybody will win here.

53:17.027 --> 53:19.261
This is your job
and you're doing your job.

53:19.363 --> 53:20.663
Everyone's going to win here,

53:20.764 --> 53:22.765
including me
once this espresso kicks in.

53:22.833 --> 53:24.566
I'm sorry, I know it's early.

53:24.668 --> 53:26.168
<i>Don't be. You've got this.</i>

53:26.237 --> 53:27.836
OK. Bye.

53:31.008 --> 53:33.942
[Brennan] If you like her,
then you should tell her.

53:34.011 --> 53:35.611
What if she's not interested?

53:35.679 --> 53:38.280
Believe me, she's interested.

53:38.349 --> 53:39.881
Have you not seen the way
she looks at you

53:39.950 --> 53:41.416
when you're not looking?

53:41.518 --> 53:44.420
Oh. No, I don't suppose
you have.

53:44.422 --> 53:46.221
If I were you,
I'd get some flowers

53:46.223 --> 53:48.290
and go and tell her
how you feel.

53:48.358 --> 53:50.125
You mean right now?

53:50.694 --> 53:52.161
Might as well.

53:52.229 --> 53:53.895
There's only two days left
of the festival, Rory.

53:53.964 --> 53:55.230
No time to waste.

53:57.568 --> 53:58.934
Right.

54:05.409 --> 54:06.709
What was that about?

54:07.411 --> 54:08.510
A girl.

54:08.512 --> 54:11.113
Ah. I see.

54:13.117 --> 54:15.650
Sounds like you're having
a nice week yourself.

54:15.652 --> 54:17.052
Dad, it's no big deal.

54:17.121 --> 54:20.722
I know,
it's none of our business.

54:20.791 --> 54:24.026
But we'd love for you to find
happiness with someone again.

54:25.228 --> 54:27.129
Whenever you're ready, son.

54:37.341 --> 54:40.075
[Brennan] What are you
doing here?

54:40.143 --> 54:41.877
I thought you were on that trip
this morning.

54:41.945 --> 54:43.646
Sorry, I didn't make it.
I, um...

54:43.714 --> 54:45.447
Well, Alroy wanted me to come in

54:45.549 --> 54:47.015
and go over my presentation
with him.

54:47.084 --> 54:48.384
Oh.

54:49.920 --> 54:52.787
It wasn't my idea. He...

54:52.789 --> 54:55.357
He wanted to go over
the deal points.

54:56.693 --> 54:58.326
He said that he was going
to talk

54:58.395 --> 55:01.096
to the other council members
about it later today.

55:01.098 --> 55:02.831
So he is interested in selling?

55:04.501 --> 55:06.635
When were you going
to tell me this?

55:07.938 --> 55:11.674
As soon as I got the courage
to walk over to the pub.

55:14.211 --> 55:16.578
I know how much this castle
means to you, Brennan.

55:16.580 --> 55:18.847
-[scoffs]
-And to everyone here. I...

55:19.984 --> 55:23.752
But Alroy said
that the town needs the money.

55:23.820 --> 55:25.187
And this deal?

55:25.255 --> 55:27.189
This could take care
of all of Kilabbey's needs

55:27.191 --> 55:29.558
for the foreseeable future.

55:29.560 --> 55:32.127
All of our needs
except the castle.

55:32.229 --> 55:33.662
Because it'll be gone.

55:33.730 --> 55:37.566
I promise you that the council
members will have input.

55:37.634 --> 55:40.202
This resort will reflect
the history here.

55:41.405 --> 55:43.638
Because it's time for a change.

55:43.707 --> 55:45.474
Building a new history together.
Wasn't that it?

55:45.542 --> 55:46.942
Do you think it's going to be
easy for me

55:47.010 --> 55:50.345
to sign off on demolishing
the castle?

55:50.448 --> 55:53.515
This is the only deal that I
have ever wanted to pull out of

55:53.517 --> 55:55.150
and that's...

55:58.222 --> 55:59.688
That's because of you.

56:06.396 --> 56:09.097
[footsteps approach]

56:09.099 --> 56:12.334
Brennan, why don't you come in
and we'll have a chat.

56:22.078 --> 56:24.446
[children playing]

56:43.567 --> 56:45.934
You all know as well as I do

56:46.003 --> 56:48.837
that we can't afford
a major renovation.

56:48.905 --> 56:51.906
We've been struggling to even
balance our operation budgets

56:51.976 --> 56:55.477
these past few years.
It's an impossible undertaking.

56:55.479 --> 56:57.446
The Krispen Group's offer
is more than generous

56:57.514 --> 57:00.082
compared with those
we've received in the past.

57:00.184 --> 57:01.150
And there's something to be said

57:01.218 --> 57:02.784
for the fact that
Lindsey's stayed

57:02.786 --> 57:05.654
for the best part of a week
to get to know the area.

57:05.656 --> 57:07.890
-And us.
-So what does this mean?

57:07.958 --> 57:11.626
We're all attached
to the castle.

57:11.628 --> 57:14.863
But I think it's time to do
what's right for the moment.

57:14.931 --> 57:20.536
Sell now to someone who will
take our opinions into account.

57:20.637 --> 57:22.037
Hmm?

57:26.610 --> 57:28.544
[phone rings]

57:29.213 --> 57:30.913
[Krispen]<i> Hello?</i>

57:30.981 --> 57:33.815
Mr. Krispen, hi, it's Lindsey.

57:33.817 --> 57:36.384
I'm so glad that I got you.
I have some updates.

57:36.453 --> 57:38.920
<i>I'm coming to Dublin.</i>

57:38.989 --> 57:40.722
Oh, wait, Dublin, Ireland?

57:40.724 --> 57:43.925
There's a similar property
for sale right on the water.

57:43.927 --> 57:46.194
A few structures to tear down,

57:46.263 --> 57:47.962
but no town council
to deal with.

57:48.032 --> 57:49.964
<i>I'm already on my way</i>
<i>to Helsinki,</i>

57:50.067 --> 57:51.199
<i>so I figured I could stop over,</i>

57:51.268 --> 57:52.835
<i>take a look</i>
<i>for a couple of days.</i>

57:52.903 --> 57:57.038
We only need one resort
in Ireland to get us going.

57:57.107 --> 58:00.242
So you're deciding between
Kilabbey and Dublin?

58:00.310 --> 58:03.178
Well, that depends. How are
things coming along down there?

58:03.247 --> 58:05.848
Well, I just had a meeting
with the head councilman,

58:05.949 --> 58:08.350
and he seems willing to sell.

58:08.352 --> 58:10.252
He just has to talk
to the other council members,

58:10.320 --> 58:12.688
get them on board and they
usually vote in line with him,

58:12.756 --> 58:15.924
so this deal could be done
as early as the weekend.

58:15.992 --> 58:18.827
Excellent. Well, once I speak
with the Dublin team,

58:18.829 --> 58:21.697
let's connect and we can decide
which one to pursue.

58:21.765 --> 58:24.499
<i>OK, I've got to go now</i>
<i>because my flight's going.</i>

58:24.501 --> 58:26.000
OK, great, well,
we'll talk then.

58:26.070 --> 58:28.036
<i>Yeah, OK. Got to go.</i>

58:39.049 --> 58:43.285
So Mr. Krispen is deciding
between your property

58:43.353 --> 58:45.287
and a coastal site in Dublin.

58:45.355 --> 58:46.989
I really want him
to choose yours

58:47.090 --> 58:48.991
because I know the town
could use the money,

58:49.059 --> 58:51.059
but I also completely understand

58:51.127 --> 58:52.461
if you want to wait
a little longer

58:52.529 --> 58:53.862
to see if someone will come by

58:53.930 --> 58:56.798
and want to buy the land
and keep the castle.

58:56.867 --> 58:58.500
We already voted yesterday,
Lindsey.

58:58.502 --> 59:02.571
We approved to move ahead
with the sale. We're ready.

59:02.639 --> 59:06.975
OK, I will do my best
to try to convince Mr. Krispen

59:07.044 --> 59:08.176
that Kilabbey is the way to go.

59:08.245 --> 59:11.580
Well, um,
I'd better get to the castle.

59:11.681 --> 59:13.515
I've got a wedding to perform.

59:13.617 --> 59:16.017
Wait, you perform
wedding ceremonies too?

59:16.019 --> 59:17.285
What don't you do for this town?

59:17.387 --> 59:21.056
Well, you know,
after matching a lot of couples,

59:21.124 --> 59:23.324
they suddenly started
asking me to marry them.

59:23.326 --> 59:26.127
So I quite enjoy it.

59:26.129 --> 59:29.765
Actually, I do need a witness.

59:29.866 --> 59:31.466
Or two?

59:33.270 --> 59:35.937
And may you live
in a blessed home,

59:35.939 --> 59:37.305
protected in your marriage,

59:37.407 --> 59:41.009
gentle and faithful,
one in your love,

59:41.078 --> 59:43.378
and kept in peace.

59:44.180 --> 59:46.014
You may kiss the bride.

59:46.016 --> 59:47.349
[they laugh]

59:48.819 --> 59:50.052
[applause]

59:50.120 --> 59:52.354
What number marriage is this
for you, Alroy?

59:52.422 --> 59:54.923
3,474.

59:54.991 --> 59:56.725
Let's make it official.

59:59.229 --> 1:00:02.097
-Congratulations.
-Thanks!

1:00:03.800 --> 1:00:05.233
Your ring is so beautiful.

1:00:05.302 --> 1:00:07.269
I have one like it.
The Claddagh ring.

1:00:07.337 --> 1:00:10.539
Oh, Justin and I picked it out
together yesterday.

1:00:10.607 --> 1:00:11.940
What's the symbolism again?

1:00:12.008 --> 1:00:15.143
Uh, the heart represents love.

1:00:15.211 --> 1:00:17.612
The hands represent friendship.

1:00:17.681 --> 1:00:20.181
And the crown represents
loyalty.

1:00:20.250 --> 1:00:21.983
And the way you wear it
also means something.

1:00:21.985 --> 1:00:23.719
You're wearing yours
on your left hand

1:00:23.787 --> 1:00:26.554
because you're married now,
with the ring facing inwards.

1:00:26.623 --> 1:00:29.323
But you can also wear it
outward,

1:00:29.393 --> 1:00:31.526
that your heart is open,
looking for love.

1:00:31.628 --> 1:00:33.895
Or your heart is taken because
you're in a relationship.

1:00:33.997 --> 1:00:38.667
Well, my heart
is definitely taken.

1:00:38.735 --> 1:00:40.469
How are you celebrating
for the rest of the day?

1:00:40.537 --> 1:00:43.037
We are going to have dinner
at the restaurant where we met.

1:00:43.107 --> 1:00:46.107
And then we're going to stay
at this tiny little inn

1:00:46.176 --> 1:00:47.776
right on the water.

1:00:47.844 --> 1:00:50.211
It's almost like we're staying
on a boat attached to an inn.

1:00:50.213 --> 1:00:51.646
That sounds so special.

1:00:51.715 --> 1:00:53.849
Yeah, it is. It's like
the blending of two worlds.

1:00:53.851 --> 1:00:55.684
The old and the new.

1:00:56.620 --> 1:00:59.420
That's it.

1:00:59.422 --> 1:01:03.725
Thank you so much for letting us
be a part of your special day.

1:01:03.794 --> 1:01:06.361
The castle will be
the front of the resort

1:01:06.429 --> 1:01:08.530
and then we'll build onto it.

1:01:08.598 --> 1:01:11.232
That's what will make it
a better sale than Dublin.

1:01:11.234 --> 1:01:13.135
That's what will make people
want to come and stay.

1:01:13.203 --> 1:01:14.736
There'll be no other place
like it.

1:01:14.838 --> 1:01:17.238
I appreciate you wanting
to incorporate the castle,

1:01:17.240 --> 1:01:20.942
but I know it's not practical
and ridiculously expensive.

1:01:21.011 --> 1:01:23.145
But a lot of castles
have been made into hotels,

1:01:23.246 --> 1:01:25.113
and they're popular.
They make money.

1:01:25.115 --> 1:01:27.281
I really think Mr. Krispen
can be convinced

1:01:27.351 --> 1:01:30.952
to go in a different direction
if we just merge the ideas.

1:01:31.822 --> 1:01:33.054
But what if he says no?

1:01:33.123 --> 1:01:35.490
Well, it's worth pitching him.

1:01:35.559 --> 1:01:37.959
I can make up a proposal based
on projections of other castles

1:01:38.028 --> 1:01:40.795
that have been renovated
to commercial use.

1:01:40.864 --> 1:01:42.797
Ask if he'll come to the party
tomorrow night.

1:01:42.866 --> 1:01:44.866
The place will be all lit up,
people celebrating.

1:01:44.868 --> 1:01:46.634
You'll be able to see
how incredible it is

1:01:46.703 --> 1:01:48.236
and pitch it to him then.

1:01:48.305 --> 1:01:50.038
It's perfect.

1:01:51.274 --> 1:01:53.174
We're going to need
a lot of help.

1:01:53.276 --> 1:01:56.244
-With what?
-How do I put this nicely?

1:01:57.480 --> 1:02:00.515
The castle needs
a major facelift.

1:02:00.584 --> 1:02:02.050
She doesn't look that bad,
does she?

1:02:02.118 --> 1:02:04.686
OK, you also have to stop
referring to her as a she

1:02:04.688 --> 1:02:06.688
or my boss is never going to
take this seriously.

1:02:06.690 --> 1:02:09.858
All right.
But she's not going to like it.

1:02:10.994 --> 1:02:12.928
[Lindsey]<i> I looked over</i>
<i>the specs that you sent me</i>

1:02:12.996 --> 1:02:15.030
<i>and I believe</i>
<i>that the Kilabbey property</i>

1:02:15.098 --> 1:02:16.631
<i>is better in every way.</i>

1:02:16.700 --> 1:02:19.334
In Dublin, we would be competing
against existing hotels

1:02:19.402 --> 1:02:22.204
that offer a similar level of
service at the same price point.

1:02:22.305 --> 1:02:23.938
Dublin does have higher tourism.

1:02:24.007 --> 1:02:26.140
<i>But Kilabbey has</i>
<i>unobstructed views.</i>

1:02:26.142 --> 1:02:27.208
And it's driving distance

1:02:27.277 --> 1:02:28.877
from numerous
historical landmarks.

1:02:28.879 --> 1:02:30.445
They also have
the matchmaking festival,

1:02:30.513 --> 1:02:32.547
which brings in 1,000 people
every year,

1:02:32.616 --> 1:02:34.416
many who make return trips.

1:02:34.484 --> 1:02:35.783
And you said yourself,

1:02:35.852 --> 1:02:37.652
we would be the only
upscale lodging option

1:02:37.754 --> 1:02:39.254
for 100 miles.

1:02:39.322 --> 1:02:41.889
The team in Dublin already has
a relationship with vendors,

1:02:41.958 --> 1:02:44.025
an expedited process
for permitting,

1:02:44.094 --> 1:02:47.629
there's infrastructure here,
which counts for a lot.

1:02:47.697 --> 1:02:49.831
Come to Kilabbey, Mr. Krispen.

1:02:49.900 --> 1:02:51.532
The festival party
is tomorrow night

1:02:51.534 --> 1:02:52.634
and you can see for yourself

1:02:52.702 --> 1:02:54.436
just how indescribable
this place is.

1:02:54.504 --> 1:02:56.838
I've seen the pictures, Lindsey.

1:02:56.907 --> 1:02:59.407
A picture cannot capture
what it feels like

1:02:59.509 --> 1:03:01.910
to actually experience
this place.

1:03:02.546 --> 1:03:04.779
All right. I'll come.

1:03:04.881 --> 1:03:06.548
You won't be sorry.

1:03:09.686 --> 1:03:12.087
-He's in!
-Ah, that's brilliant.

1:03:12.155 --> 1:03:15.456
Right, Rory, you and I
are in charge of touch-ups

1:03:15.525 --> 1:03:16.791
and handiwork inside the castle.

1:03:16.859 --> 1:03:18.660
Do you think Olivia
and the girls might help?

1:03:18.728 --> 1:03:21.028
I bet Seamus and Adelia
would pitch in too.

1:03:21.098 --> 1:03:23.865
Alroy, you and Siobhan
are in charge of landscaping.

1:03:23.934 --> 1:03:25.634
Connor will help
taking the old plants out

1:03:25.702 --> 1:03:27.035
and putting new ones in.

1:03:27.137 --> 1:03:28.703
And Maebh, you are in charge
of visual frosting.

1:03:28.772 --> 1:03:30.205
So anything you can add

1:03:30.273 --> 1:03:33.040
to the decor that you already
have planned, go for it.

1:03:33.110 --> 1:03:36.210
We have one chance
to make a big impression.

1:03:36.313 --> 1:03:37.879
All right, guys,
let's get to it.

1:03:39.850 --> 1:03:43.084
OK. I'll go prepare my document
with all the projections.

1:03:43.153 --> 1:03:45.320
Let's hope your boss
goes for this crazy idea.

1:03:45.388 --> 1:03:47.022
I know.

1:03:54.063 --> 1:03:56.063
Has anyone got floodlights?

1:03:56.133 --> 1:03:57.966
-Floodlights are coming.
-Good man.

1:03:58.034 --> 1:04:00.168
And we've got more champers.

1:04:00.236 --> 1:04:02.504
And I've got fuel for everyone.

1:04:05.142 --> 1:04:06.207
Really?

1:04:06.276 --> 1:04:07.676
Oh, sorry.

1:04:09.479 --> 1:04:11.112
-[laughs]
-Oh, really, Ms. Johnson?

1:04:11.181 --> 1:04:12.714
What?

1:04:12.782 --> 1:04:14.349
-That's Grant's nightmare.
-What are you talking about?

1:04:14.351 --> 1:04:15.883
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1:04:15.952 --> 1:04:18.520
OK, stop. We have way too much
work to do

1:04:18.588 --> 1:04:21.088
for you to be tying me up
like this.

1:04:21.158 --> 1:04:22.524
Goodness.

1:04:23.927 --> 1:04:26.127
So, let's say this all works.

1:04:26.229 --> 1:04:28.330
What do you think the Grand Room
will be turned into?

1:04:28.431 --> 1:04:29.397
Mm! I don't know.

1:04:29.499 --> 1:04:31.900
Maybe a dining area?
Or a lounge?

1:04:31.968 --> 1:04:34.668
-It won't be a spa, no?
-Absolutely not!

1:04:34.670 --> 1:04:36.370
There should definitely be
a bar, though.

1:04:36.440 --> 1:04:37.538
With old timey drinks.

1:04:37.607 --> 1:04:39.374
You could serve
Brennan's whiskey.

1:04:39.442 --> 1:04:42.076
-That's a good idea!
-[Rory] Good luck with that.

1:04:42.145 --> 1:04:44.679
This guy has loads of offers
from investors

1:04:44.748 --> 1:04:46.047
to distribute his whiskey,

1:04:46.116 --> 1:04:48.850
and he still insists
on keeping it a small batch.

1:04:48.852 --> 1:04:50.385
Why is that?

1:04:50.453 --> 1:04:52.687
The truck has just arrived
with more lights.

1:04:52.756 --> 1:04:54.989
-Could I have a hand?
-I'll give you a hand.

1:04:54.991 --> 1:04:56.491
You guys stay here.

1:05:01.865 --> 1:05:05.267
[birdsong]

1:05:09.172 --> 1:05:11.239
[typing on keyboard]

1:05:11.341 --> 1:05:12.674
[knocking]

1:05:14.144 --> 1:05:17.845
If those are more of those
poppy seed biscuits, Seamus,

1:05:17.914 --> 1:05:22.183
I appreciate the thought, but
I have absolutely overdone it.

1:05:24.954 --> 1:05:26.421
Hi.

1:05:27.757 --> 1:05:29.024
Hi.

1:05:30.093 --> 1:05:33.995
-Are you finished?
-That'd be a no.

1:05:34.063 --> 1:05:37.165
But I figured we could have
an early dinner.

1:05:37.267 --> 1:05:39.334
There's a place
I think you'd really like.

1:05:41.338 --> 1:05:42.504
I'd love to.

1:05:51.581 --> 1:05:54.982
I knew you screwed up
my soda bread! I was so careful.

1:05:54.984 --> 1:05:57.852
I know. I'm sorry.

1:05:57.921 --> 1:06:00.254
And you should have given me
those points in hurling.

1:06:00.323 --> 1:06:02.123
Mm, still on the fence
about that one.

1:06:02.125 --> 1:06:04.693
Wait, what about Siobhan's
class? Did you mess up my yarn?

1:06:04.761 --> 1:06:06.127
No, that was all you.

1:06:06.196 --> 1:06:07.662
[both chuckle]

1:06:08.298 --> 1:06:09.898
I get it.

1:06:09.966 --> 1:06:13.535
I came in here all threatening,
and you felt territorial.

1:06:13.537 --> 1:06:15.103
More like protective.

1:06:16.239 --> 1:06:17.672
That's kind of the same thing.

1:06:18.909 --> 1:06:21.843
Well, I don't feel territorial
or protective anymore.

1:06:25.548 --> 1:06:28.049
Now I feel
I have a teammate in all this.

1:06:29.819 --> 1:06:31.419
You do?

1:06:32.121 --> 1:06:34.656
Yeah. I do.

1:06:36.692 --> 1:06:38.493
[Grant] Oh, hey there!

1:06:39.862 --> 1:06:41.663
[Grant] Nice spot for a picnic.

1:06:41.731 --> 1:06:42.864
Yep.

1:06:42.932 --> 1:06:45.934
Beautiful sedimentary rock
out here.

1:06:46.002 --> 1:06:48.937
Hon, will you remind me
to look that up?

1:06:49.005 --> 1:06:53.340
Cos I'm curious
if it's sandstone or limestone.

1:06:53.410 --> 1:06:55.709
You two enjoy the terrain.

1:06:55.779 --> 1:06:57.846
Good luck.

1:06:57.947 --> 1:06:59.381
[laughs]

1:07:01.484 --> 1:07:03.785
I'm so sorry
your guy found someone else.

1:07:03.853 --> 1:07:06.388
I am so crushed. [laughs]

1:07:07.123 --> 1:07:08.690
I'm happy for him.

1:07:08.791 --> 1:07:12.827
She must be... really into
gardening, or landscaping, or...

1:07:12.895 --> 1:07:15.830
-Or tuning people out?
-[laughs]

1:07:17.700 --> 1:07:19.300
To unexpected matches.

1:07:20.270 --> 1:07:21.603
I wish them all the luck.

1:07:28.512 --> 1:07:30.812
[pub chatter]

1:07:33.984 --> 1:07:37.318
Oh, Brennan.
I'm glad it's you back here.

1:07:37.387 --> 1:07:38.686
I was thinking it was your dad,

1:07:38.755 --> 1:07:40.721
sneaking a dessert
before the party.

1:07:40.824 --> 1:07:42.756
No, just me.

1:07:42.758 --> 1:07:44.626
I don't want to jinx it,
but I thought it might be nice

1:07:44.694 --> 1:07:46.294
to have a bottle
of something special

1:07:46.362 --> 1:07:48.396
to celebrate with Lindsey
if her boss goes for the idea.

1:07:48.498 --> 1:07:51.799
Not to put any pressure on you
tonight, but maybe--

1:07:51.801 --> 1:07:53.268
Mum, stop it, please.

1:07:53.336 --> 1:07:55.837
I'm a grown man.
I don't need romantic advice.

1:07:55.905 --> 1:07:59.507
I was only going to suggest
you wear your blue suit.

1:07:59.575 --> 1:08:01.476
Makes your eyes look nice.

1:08:07.650 --> 1:08:09.083
How possible is it

1:08:09.151 --> 1:08:10.985
that Mr. Krispen thinks
I've totally lost my mind?

1:08:11.054 --> 1:08:12.687
[Ellie]<i> It's possible.</i>

1:08:12.755 --> 1:08:14.722
<i>But he could also say it's</i>
<i>the best idea he's ever heard</i>

1:08:14.724 --> 1:08:16.658
<i>and give you a corner office.</i>

1:08:16.726 --> 1:08:18.125
It's the perfect solution.

1:08:18.127 --> 1:08:19.794
You have to text me
right after you pitch him

1:08:19.863 --> 1:08:21.563
and let me know how it goes.

1:08:21.631 --> 1:08:22.931
If I don't write back, it's
because we're in a big meeting

1:08:22.999 --> 1:08:24.598
with that UK company
I was telling you about.

1:08:24.668 --> 1:08:27.001
<i>I hear they're starting</i>
<i>a preservation initiative,</i>

1:08:27.003 --> 1:08:28.670
<i>something that might be</i>
<i>up your alley.</i>

1:08:28.738 --> 1:08:29.803
Yeah, sure.

1:08:29.873 --> 1:08:31.873
Any updates on Mr. Town Council?

1:08:33.043 --> 1:08:35.809
I'm focusing on my pitch, El.

1:08:35.879 --> 1:08:37.111
I can only handle

1:08:37.180 --> 1:08:39.047
one potentially upending
life event at a time.

1:08:39.115 --> 1:08:41.949
<i>I'm giving you</i>
<i>a virtual fist bump.</i>

1:08:41.951 --> 1:08:44.285
-Good luck at the party.
<i>-Thank you.</i>

1:08:49.626 --> 1:08:51.359
[quiet chatter]

1:08:54.964 --> 1:08:58.666
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:08:58.668 --> 1:09:01.136
-Quite the night ahead of us.
-We do.

1:09:02.272 --> 1:09:04.105
-[Brennan] Think that's him?
-Yeah.

1:09:05.875 --> 1:09:08.209
Oh, gosh. Oh, my gosh,
that's my ring.

1:09:08.311 --> 1:09:10.111
It's OK.

1:09:12.749 --> 1:09:14.182
Oh, look, it's a proposal!

1:09:14.250 --> 1:09:16.885
See? I told you
this festival worked.

1:09:17.587 --> 1:09:19.254
[Brennan] No.

1:09:24.594 --> 1:09:26.394
By the way, you look stunning.

1:09:27.797 --> 1:09:29.564
Thank you.

1:09:29.665 --> 1:09:32.200
-Ready?
-I'm ready.

1:09:40.276 --> 1:09:41.275
Mr. Krispen.

1:09:41.344 --> 1:09:42.743
-How are you?
-How are you?

1:09:42.812 --> 1:09:44.645
-Beautiful.
-Sir, welcome to Kilabbey.

1:09:44.647 --> 1:09:46.814
Thank you. Lovely.
How wonderful. Good to see you.

1:09:46.816 --> 1:09:49.017
Come with me. I can't wait
to show you around.

1:09:57.927 --> 1:10:02.196
[traditional Irish music]

1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:07.669
[clapping]

1:10:14.043 --> 1:10:17.212
[music ends, applause]

1:10:25.054 --> 1:10:27.421
That's, uh...
That's really quite something.

1:10:27.490 --> 1:10:28.790
I know.

1:10:28.858 --> 1:10:30.024
They do this
every year of the festival?

1:10:30.092 --> 1:10:31.793
Yes. And I have it
on good authority

1:10:31.795 --> 1:10:33.761
that there may be
fireworks later.

1:10:35.365 --> 1:10:38.199
Ooh, what are those?

1:10:38.267 --> 1:10:39.567
Irish trifle.

1:10:39.636 --> 1:10:42.003
It's actually made
by one of the council members.

1:10:42.071 --> 1:10:43.671
She has a bakery.

1:10:43.673 --> 1:10:45.940
There's a lot of family-owned
businesses in the area.

1:10:46.709 --> 1:10:48.275
Mm!

1:10:48.277 --> 1:10:49.710
I know. [chuckles]

1:10:49.712 --> 1:10:51.479
We ought to see
if we can do a deal,

1:10:51.481 --> 1:10:53.948
see if we can sell some
of her goods in the restaurant.

1:10:54.016 --> 1:10:55.816
Sounds like we have a lot
to talk about

1:10:55.818 --> 1:10:58.319
-in regards to the property.
-[glasses chinking]

1:10:58.388 --> 1:11:00.788
<i>Fáilte romhaibh!</i>

1:11:00.857 --> 1:11:02.089
[chatter quiets]

1:11:02.158 --> 1:11:03.457
[chuckles]

1:11:03.526 --> 1:11:05.493
Ah, the last night
of the festival

1:11:05.561 --> 1:11:07.828
is always bittersweet for me.

1:11:07.897 --> 1:11:10.564
Some of you have found
friendship here,

1:11:10.633 --> 1:11:13.734
meaningful experience,
adventure.

1:11:13.837 --> 1:11:19.507
And some of you have found love,
or the beginnings of it.

1:11:19.509 --> 1:11:22.910
And I admit that my matching
isn't always perfect,

1:11:22.978 --> 1:11:24.646
but it's not supposed to be.

1:11:24.714 --> 1:11:30.451
We hope that
you take the spirit of Kilabbey

1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:31.785
home with you,

1:11:31.855 --> 1:11:34.489
You're always welcome back.

1:11:35.591 --> 1:11:36.624
Till we meet again!

1:11:36.726 --> 1:11:37.925
[cheering]

1:11:38.027 --> 1:11:39.794
[applause]

1:11:50.172 --> 1:11:52.307
-Thank you.
<i>-Sláinte.</i>

1:11:54.810 --> 1:11:56.510
-Have you made your pitch yet?
-No, I haven't.

1:11:56.579 --> 1:11:58.846
But I feel like
it's going to go really well.

1:11:59.849 --> 1:12:02.950
Speaking of pitches,
I have one for you.

1:12:02.952 --> 1:12:05.052
-For me?
-Yeah.

1:12:05.121 --> 1:12:07.955
I spoke to Aoife,
and she sparked at the idea

1:12:08.023 --> 1:12:10.190
of turning her barn
into a distillery

1:12:10.260 --> 1:12:12.359
at a really reasonable price.

1:12:12.361 --> 1:12:15.395
So I did some research and
started a business plan for you,

1:12:15.465 --> 1:12:17.665
where you could still make
small-batch whiskey,

1:12:17.667 --> 1:12:21.235
just...
on a slightly larger scale.

1:12:21.304 --> 1:12:23.871
That's really, um... Wow.

1:12:25.575 --> 1:12:28.742
I just... I was just trying
to help. I...

1:12:28.812 --> 1:12:31.279
I just... I...
Cos you love it so much.

1:12:31.347 --> 1:12:32.613
Yeah. I do.

1:12:36.486 --> 1:12:38.753
I'm gonna go find Mr. Krispen.

1:12:38.821 --> 1:12:40.354
Good luck.

1:12:41.691 --> 1:12:44.659
[Krispen] Yep, we'll be
in touch. Yeah. Thank you.

1:12:44.727 --> 1:12:47.261
Yeah. Goodbye.

1:12:47.330 --> 1:12:50.665
Mr. Krispen. I hope
you're enjoying the party?

1:12:51.567 --> 1:12:52.767
That was Dublin.

1:12:52.835 --> 1:12:54.868
They offered
to drop the sale price,

1:12:54.938 --> 1:12:56.704
make it a more enticing offer.

1:12:56.773 --> 1:12:59.406
I told them
I'd have to think on it.

1:12:59.408 --> 1:13:02.510
Well, there is a reason
I wanted you to come here

1:13:02.578 --> 1:13:04.244
and experience this land.

1:13:04.347 --> 1:13:07.782
Because I think
that we can make this property

1:13:07.883 --> 1:13:10.417
more profitable and marketable
than Dublin.

1:13:10.419 --> 1:13:11.952
And how is that?

1:13:12.021 --> 1:13:14.188
We build a resort
onto the castle.

1:13:14.256 --> 1:13:16.190
We'd draw people in

1:13:16.259 --> 1:13:18.092
that are looking for
a historic experience,

1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:19.894
but give them all the comforts
of a modern one.

1:13:19.896 --> 1:13:22.630
We're blending the old
and the new.

1:13:22.632 --> 1:13:26.000
It would be unlike anything
that you have ever built before.

1:13:26.068 --> 1:13:27.201
And the council members,

1:13:27.270 --> 1:13:29.136
they're eager for us
on come up with a price

1:13:29.239 --> 1:13:30.904
that will make it
worth our while,

1:13:30.974 --> 1:13:33.808
which I absolutely think it is.

1:13:33.876 --> 1:13:36.944
Lindsey,
I have to go with Dublin then.

1:13:37.013 --> 1:13:38.679
It's not even a choice.

1:13:38.781 --> 1:13:41.481
This castle is magnificent.

1:13:41.551 --> 1:13:43.184
I recognize the beauty in it.

1:13:43.252 --> 1:13:45.385
But the cost of incorporating it
into a new design,

1:13:45.387 --> 1:13:47.488
let alone doing a renovation?

1:13:47.590 --> 1:13:50.224
It's not the kind of project
our company can take on.

1:13:50.292 --> 1:13:51.826
OK, well,
what about a partnership?

1:13:51.894 --> 1:13:53.961
A collaboration
with another company?

1:13:54.063 --> 1:13:57.031
We may never get a chance to do
anything like this ever again.

1:13:57.033 --> 1:13:59.467
Our company isn't
about enhancing the past,

1:13:59.535 --> 1:14:01.268
it's focusing on the future.

1:14:01.270 --> 1:14:06.073
I value your opinion,
but I've made up my mind.

1:14:06.075 --> 1:14:08.209
You enjoy the rest of the party.

1:14:08.277 --> 1:14:11.245
We'll debrief
when we get back to New York.

1:14:11.347 --> 1:14:13.014
I'll see you soon.

1:14:17.887 --> 1:14:19.653
[car engine starts]

1:14:19.722 --> 1:14:20.955
Well?

1:14:21.791 --> 1:14:23.591
He didn't go for it.

1:14:28.031 --> 1:14:29.397
What?

1:14:31.367 --> 1:14:33.301
So it's all over? That's it?

1:14:34.470 --> 1:14:36.504
I said everything that I could.

1:14:39.308 --> 1:14:41.242
He said that it's not something

1:14:41.310 --> 1:14:43.444
that our company can take on
right now.

1:14:44.213 --> 1:14:46.814
I'm so sorry.

1:14:46.882 --> 1:14:49.050
I really thought
our plan was gonna work.

1:14:50.753 --> 1:14:53.821
Guess I have to go back
to New York now.

1:14:53.889 --> 1:14:58.092
I mean... it's not like I have
anything to stay here for.

1:15:01.431 --> 1:15:03.865
No. Of course.

1:15:06.602 --> 1:15:09.203
You should come back inside.

1:15:09.271 --> 1:15:11.572
I know everyone's gonna want
to say goodbye.

1:15:13.076 --> 1:15:15.142
I will. Just give me a sec.

1:15:15.210 --> 1:15:17.111
Be in in a second.

1:15:21.183 --> 1:15:22.416
Yeah.

1:15:47.110 --> 1:15:48.408
[cheering]

1:15:48.410 --> 1:15:50.611
[fireworks explode]

1:15:56.419 --> 1:15:57.718
take care now.

1:15:57.786 --> 1:16:00.554
And I know you'll be
back here soon, Olivia.

1:16:00.656 --> 1:16:03.490
Congratulations.
Rory's a good lad.

1:16:03.559 --> 1:16:06.026
He is.
And thanks for everything.

1:16:06.028 --> 1:16:07.594
It's been such a wonderful week.

1:16:07.597 --> 1:16:10.531
We're sorry things didn't work
out with the castle, Lindsey.

1:16:10.533 --> 1:16:11.932
But getting to fix it up

1:16:12.001 --> 1:16:14.501
made us feel so much
more connected to this place.

1:16:14.570 --> 1:16:16.070
Thank you.

1:16:16.138 --> 1:16:19.840
Thank you. And thank you so much
for working so hard.

1:16:21.143 --> 1:16:22.576
Bye.

1:16:22.679 --> 1:16:24.312
[Lindsey] Bye.

1:16:27.650 --> 1:16:30.751
And maybe the right buyer
will come along

1:16:30.753 --> 1:16:32.686
and want to save your castle.

1:16:32.755 --> 1:16:35.623
I think you can call it
"our castle" now, love.

1:16:43.599 --> 1:16:45.533
Thank you for everything.

1:16:53.309 --> 1:16:56.710
[Alroy] I know you're
disappointed about last night.

1:16:56.812 --> 1:16:59.880
We all are. But it's important
that we decided

1:16:59.949 --> 1:17:01.181
we were ready for a change.

1:17:01.250 --> 1:17:05.419
Change is necessary.
It's part of life.

1:17:07.156 --> 1:17:10.858
I know my matching
isn't always up to the mark,

1:17:10.960 --> 1:17:13.093
but I'm not usually
that far off.

1:17:13.162 --> 1:17:16.196
Lindsey was a surprise.

1:17:16.265 --> 1:17:17.631
It wouldn't have worked, Alroy.

1:17:17.700 --> 1:17:20.734
I don't think I'm ready
to be with someone again.

1:17:20.803 --> 1:17:22.870
To have that hurt
all over again.

1:17:25.040 --> 1:17:27.541
[Brennan]<i> Lindsey doesn't want</i>
<i>to stay here and I do.</i>

1:17:27.543 --> 1:17:29.377
<i>She doesn't have a life here.</i>

1:17:43.559 --> 1:17:46.127
[boat horn honks]

1:17:49.598 --> 1:17:51.832
[Krispen] So,
that's a green light

1:17:51.900 --> 1:17:53.901
on Tate Property Australia.

1:17:56.405 --> 1:17:57.938
Lindsey?

1:17:58.741 --> 1:18:00.141
What do you think?

1:18:00.209 --> 1:18:03.043
Yeah. No problem.
I can be there on Monday.

1:18:03.112 --> 1:18:05.546
I already have a relationship
with their team in Sydney.

1:18:05.614 --> 1:18:07.615
I'll get started on this
right away.

1:18:08.484 --> 1:18:10.117
[Krispen] Perfect. Great.

1:18:10.186 --> 1:18:12.786
Um... So what I'm trying to
accomplish on the Tate property

1:18:12.788 --> 1:18:15.856
is similar to what we just did
with the Kaiser.

1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:21.162
[phone buzzes]

1:18:25.601 --> 1:18:27.001
[chuckles]

1:18:44.821 --> 1:18:46.353
Kilabbey.

1:18:47.923 --> 1:18:49.055
Guess who got us tickets

1:18:49.125 --> 1:18:51.291
to that Egyptology exhibit
this weekend?

1:18:51.293 --> 1:18:53.928
You're welcome. I actually
am really excited about it.

1:18:53.996 --> 1:18:56.029
I heard there's gonna be
an Egyptian food truck.

1:18:56.132 --> 1:18:58.632
Mr. Krispen asked me to stop by,
see if you want to take a look

1:18:58.634 --> 1:19:00.167
at my specs
for the Gersh project,

1:19:00.236 --> 1:19:03.137
since there may be some overlap
with Melbourne.

1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:05.506
I don't think
I'm going to do that.

1:19:05.574 --> 1:19:07.808
You want someone else
to take it?

1:19:07.876 --> 1:19:12.246
No, I... think
I'm going to quit.

1:19:13.182 --> 1:19:14.615
I'm sorry, what?

1:19:14.683 --> 1:19:18.085
Yeah. There's always gonna be
another deal to make,

1:19:18.153 --> 1:19:20.687
another redeye to catch.

1:19:20.756 --> 1:19:23.557
I want to be in one place,

1:19:23.626 --> 1:19:25.592
overseeing one project
at a time.

1:19:25.661 --> 1:19:27.561
I want to be
a part of the process,

1:19:27.630 --> 1:19:31.498
not just hopping on a plane
the second the contract's done.

1:19:31.567 --> 1:19:33.634
It's like I'm missing
all of the good stuff

1:19:33.702 --> 1:19:35.202
in the sandwich.

1:19:36.639 --> 1:19:39.139
OK, so... where would you go?

1:19:39.141 --> 1:19:41.041
A management company
in New York?

1:19:41.109 --> 1:19:42.743
I don't know.

1:19:42.745 --> 1:19:44.845
But I'm excited to find out.

1:19:44.914 --> 1:19:47.314
[stream roars]

1:19:49.151 --> 1:19:51.085
So the fermenter's gonna go
over there,

1:19:51.087 --> 1:19:52.619
the boiling pots there.

1:19:52.688 --> 1:19:54.788
I want to make sure I still have
enough storage space.

1:19:54.890 --> 1:19:57.357
I heard you had another offer.
An investor in Galway?

1:19:57.359 --> 1:19:59.860
I did. Means we might be able
to open even earlier.

1:19:59.962 --> 1:20:03.363
Good. Your mam sent me over
with your lunch,

1:20:03.365 --> 1:20:05.699
and this for the walls, right.

1:20:10.005 --> 1:20:11.204
Alroy wanted me to tell you

1:20:11.274 --> 1:20:13.540
he'll see you at the castle
later on.

1:20:13.609 --> 1:20:15.543
-Right.
-All right?

1:20:36.265 --> 1:20:39.333
Our engineer will double check
with the inspection report

1:20:39.401 --> 1:20:41.535
and make sure none of
the walls are weight bearing.

1:20:41.603 --> 1:20:43.204
That sounds grand.

1:20:46.308 --> 1:20:48.909
Ah. Brennan. Good timing.

1:20:54.150 --> 1:20:56.450
What are you doing here?

1:20:56.518 --> 1:21:01.655
I'm evaluating the property
for my new company.

1:21:01.723 --> 1:21:03.123
They're looking

1:21:03.192 --> 1:21:05.325
to get a preservation initiative
off the ground,

1:21:05.394 --> 1:21:07.427
and when I mentioned
the property,

1:21:07.496 --> 1:21:10.664
-they were very interested.
-Really?

1:21:13.635 --> 1:21:16.537
Lindsey, I'll see you
back at the council chamber.

1:21:16.605 --> 1:21:17.771
OK.

1:21:24.747 --> 1:21:26.647
I never heard back from you.

1:21:27.250 --> 1:21:29.316
I know.

1:21:29.418 --> 1:21:32.852
[sighs] I thought
it would be easier.

1:21:32.922 --> 1:21:34.888
I should never
have let you leave like that.

1:21:36.658 --> 1:21:37.924
And I'm sorry I was so weird

1:21:37.993 --> 1:21:39.392
about the business proposal
that you started.

1:21:39.462 --> 1:21:42.062
-The unsolicited proposal?
-But you were right.

1:21:42.130 --> 1:21:44.364
I am starting a distillery
at Aoife's.

1:21:45.467 --> 1:21:48.501
Turns out
that change isn't so scary.

1:21:48.571 --> 1:21:50.170
Taking a chance isn't so scary

1:21:50.239 --> 1:21:52.172
when you're doing
something you love.

1:21:53.642 --> 1:21:55.876
And it seems
that you're doing the same.

1:21:58.113 --> 1:22:02.148
Well... You know, if this
project gets off the ground,

1:22:02.218 --> 1:22:06.086
I'm probably gonna be
stationed here, overseeing it.

1:22:06.088 --> 1:22:10.391
Until then I'll be in the UK,
managing smaller restorations.

1:22:10.459 --> 1:22:14.194
So... maybe we could start
going back and forth?

1:22:14.797 --> 1:22:17.097
Why would we do that?

1:22:17.166 --> 1:22:19.233
Well, I know I need
a taste tester.

1:22:19.301 --> 1:22:21.168
OK. Yeah.

1:22:21.236 --> 1:22:22.635
Occasional whiskey pourer.

1:22:22.705 --> 1:22:24.939
I think we could
probably work something out.

1:22:32.815 --> 1:22:35.082
My grandmother's ring.

1:22:35.150 --> 1:22:38.852
It's engraved "JTK Jewelers".

1:22:38.854 --> 1:22:40.987
It was made in Kilabbey.

1:22:40.989 --> 1:22:44.391
I just...
I'd never looked closely enough.

1:22:47.263 --> 1:22:50.464
And it was facing the wrong way.

1:22:52.968 --> 1:22:55.002
This means you're taken?

1:22:57.506 --> 1:22:59.073
I hope so.
