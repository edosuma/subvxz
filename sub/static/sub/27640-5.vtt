WEBVTT

00:02.112 --> 00:04.114
David, what time is Patrick's
housewarming tonight?

00:04.138 --> 00:05.506
Hmm, you'll have to ask him.

00:05.531 --> 00:07.432
He told me he doesn't want my help,

00:07.466 --> 00:09.367
so I'm just gonna play
the supportive partner,

00:09.401 --> 00:10.868
and watch him fail.

00:10.903 --> 00:12.562
Okay, it's just that if
Ted and I are gonna be

00:12.587 --> 00:15.122
fashionably late, we need
to know when it starts.

00:15.975 --> 00:18.783
Jocelyn: There you are, Alexis!

00:18.811 --> 00:20.978
- Good morning, Roses.
- Jocelyn, Roland.

00:21.013 --> 00:24.549
Look at you, positively
flushed with motherly glow.

00:24.583 --> 00:27.585
We've just been running
around looking for Alexis.

00:27.610 --> 00:28.877
That's so sweet; what's up?

00:28.921 --> 00:30.198
Remember that time that you told me

00:30.222 --> 00:32.812
you'd be there for me
if I ever needed you?

00:32.837 --> 00:34.257
I don't think that was me.

00:34.282 --> 00:37.495
Well, our babysitter for
tonight just canceled on us,

00:37.529 --> 00:39.597
and we were gonna have dinner,

00:39.631 --> 00:41.523
and uh, a couples massage.

00:41.548 --> 00:44.216
But unfortunately, the
couple that massages us

00:44.241 --> 00:46.647
can only do it once a month, so...

00:46.672 --> 00:48.372
Hmm, no. Um...

00:48.407 --> 00:49.751
well, I totally would think about it,

00:49.775 --> 00:52.143
but I have a housewarming thing tonight.

00:52.168 --> 00:54.336
Jocelyn and Roland: Ohhh...

00:56.123 --> 00:57.423
David?

00:57.448 --> 00:59.916
Is Patrick also going to
that housewarming party?

00:59.941 --> 01:02.640
Patrick's throwing the
party, unfortunately.

01:03.255 --> 01:05.265
Well Rollie, we're just
gonna have to cancel.

01:05.290 --> 01:07.792
Because we have asked
literally everyone.

01:07.826 --> 01:09.537
Oh, jeez.

01:09.562 --> 01:11.196
Thanks anyways, Roses.

01:11.221 --> 01:13.255
Moira: Sorry.

01:15.841 --> 01:17.835
Well, that was weird.

01:17.860 --> 01:20.161
Seriously. A nighttime couples massage,

01:20.205 --> 01:22.206
what is this, 1985?!

01:22.241 --> 01:25.543
No! They asked everyone
at the table except us,

01:25.577 --> 01:26.878
we're sitting right here!

01:26.903 --> 01:29.338
They're not going to ask
someone of your age, John.

01:29.363 --> 01:31.826
We raised two kids.

01:31.851 --> 01:33.452
"Raised" might be a stretch.

01:33.477 --> 01:35.979
Our nursery was in a
different wing of the house.

01:36.004 --> 01:37.849
- It was a design flaw.
- I'm a light sleeper.

01:41.422 --> 01:45.992
-- Synced and corrected by ChrisKe --

01:47.937 --> 01:50.001
John, you're not still working on that

01:50.026 --> 01:51.793
cumbersome laundry hamper?

01:51.837 --> 01:53.953
I told you, it's a playpen, Moira.

01:53.978 --> 01:55.412
I was hoping you were joking.

01:55.437 --> 01:57.739
No. After Roland and Jocelyn's

01:57.764 --> 01:59.451
little oversight this morning,

01:59.476 --> 02:02.687
I... took it upon myself
to offer our services.

02:02.712 --> 02:05.347
Why in God's name would you do that?!

02:05.372 --> 02:07.273
It's a principle thing.

02:07.298 --> 02:10.532
Roland and Jocelyn don't think
we can take care of a kid.

02:10.564 --> 02:13.132
That's an argument I'm willing to lose.

02:13.893 --> 02:16.460
So now I have go to Ronnie's by myself.

02:16.485 --> 02:17.852
What?

02:17.877 --> 02:19.440
I told you, the Lifetime Network

02:19.464 --> 02:21.866
is re-airing the movie
I did with Joyce DeWitt.

02:21.900 --> 02:24.468
Remember? "Not Without My Cousin."

02:24.503 --> 02:25.970
And Ronnie's TV gets that channel,

02:26.004 --> 02:27.271
I told you this, John!

02:27.306 --> 02:28.973
Or at least I'm telling you now.

02:29.007 --> 02:31.906
Okay, well then, have fun.

02:32.678 --> 02:34.085
I'm more than capable

02:34.110 --> 02:36.111
of looking after this kid myself.

02:36.279 --> 02:38.314
John, my sweet husband.

02:38.339 --> 02:40.874
We have nothing to prove as parents.

02:40.899 --> 02:42.533
We did our best for our children.

02:42.558 --> 02:44.358
Yeah, we were there most weeknights.

02:44.383 --> 02:46.384
For at least a couple of hours.

02:46.409 --> 02:47.686
Unless we were out for the evening.

02:47.711 --> 02:48.978
Yeah, or jetting around.

02:49.003 --> 02:50.837
Or if it was a really long day.

02:50.862 --> 02:52.867
Yeah, no, no, I'm not the
least bit concerned, Moira.

02:54.343 --> 02:57.245
Besides, if Roland
can look after a baby,

02:57.270 --> 02:58.603
anyone can.

03:00.677 --> 03:01.911
Hey, Jocelyn.

03:01.936 --> 03:03.504
- Jocelyn: Hi, Johnny.
- Roland: Hi, Johnny.

03:03.756 --> 03:05.617
Jocelyn: Thank you so much, Johnny,

03:05.644 --> 03:08.709
it just would've never
occurred to us to ask you.

03:08.734 --> 03:10.281
Are you sure you're up for this?

03:10.306 --> 03:11.740
Oh, he'll be fine, honey,

03:11.765 --> 03:15.219
And if he does find
himself completely lost,

03:15.253 --> 03:17.121
and believe me, he will,

03:17.146 --> 03:18.788
he will have...

03:18.813 --> 03:20.947
the baby binder to hold his hand.

03:20.972 --> 03:22.472
Right here, Johnny.

03:22.497 --> 03:24.831
Okay, well, here goes nothing.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.678
- Yeah.
- I don't know why, I'm just...

03:26.703 --> 03:28.399
I'm having a hard time letting go.

03:28.433 --> 03:30.067
I've got him. I've got him, Jocelyn.

03:30.102 --> 03:31.479
- Oh, okay, okay.
- Well, I know why.

03:31.503 --> 03:32.953
It's because you don't trust
the guy, and believe me,

03:32.978 --> 03:35.079
I don't either, but
we're in this now, so...

03:35.104 --> 03:37.172
try not think about it. Okay...

03:37.197 --> 03:38.997
Wow, Moira.

03:39.022 --> 03:41.857
Looking so elegant for
a night of babysitting.

03:41.882 --> 03:45.051
Just dressed to the
nines in choking hazards.

03:45.076 --> 03:48.646
Sadly, Jocelyn, I won't be
here this evening to intercede.

03:48.671 --> 03:50.705
Oh wow, so it's just gonna be Johnny,

03:50.823 --> 03:53.124
alone with our precious miracle baby?

03:53.149 --> 03:54.917
Uh... honey,

03:54.942 --> 03:56.943
come on, we're gonna
be late for our massage.

03:57.020 --> 03:59.288
You know Ron and Linda
like to do those stretches

03:59.313 --> 04:01.749
before they get us on the table, so...

04:01.774 --> 04:04.242
I'll be thinking about all
of you during my massage.

04:04.267 --> 04:06.234
No, no need for that, Roland.

04:06.259 --> 04:08.593
Okay Johnny, just don't
do anything I wouldn't do.

04:08.618 --> 04:09.684
Jocelyn: Love you!

04:09.975 --> 04:11.734
- What?
- Whoop! Whoop!

04:11.767 --> 04:14.294
Boop boop be boop!

04:16.000 --> 04:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:23.588 --> 04:25.422
Wow. What are those?

04:25.447 --> 04:27.181
These are party shots.

04:27.206 --> 04:29.607
- Hmm...
- You ever had one before?

04:29.632 --> 04:31.328
No, nope.

04:32.226 --> 04:33.960
Fine, once.

04:33.985 --> 04:35.986
Twice.

04:36.171 --> 04:37.711
Fine, I had a tray in Cancun.

04:37.736 --> 04:40.371
Okay, well they kinda
go with my overall theme

04:40.396 --> 04:43.432
of a good old-fashioned high
school slumber party, so.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.792
Mhmm, I still don't know
why you were so quick

04:45.817 --> 04:47.618
to dismiss my theme idea.

04:47.643 --> 04:49.077
Where is anybody gonna find

04:49.102 --> 04:51.352
glass-blown Venetian masks around here?

04:51.917 --> 04:53.261
Besides, people are kind of excited

04:53.285 --> 04:54.898
about the high school idea.

04:55.445 --> 04:58.189
Okay. Walk me through
the high school idea.

04:58.214 --> 05:01.049
Models and teen actors are
just gonna lounge around

05:01.093 --> 05:02.660
in their bras and thongs,

05:02.694 --> 05:04.762
and take Polaroids of
themselves all night?

05:04.787 --> 05:06.849
What was your high
school experience like?

05:07.064 --> 05:08.498
What was yours like?

05:08.708 --> 05:10.912
Besides, where are we going
to find a salad bowl of E

05:10.936 --> 05:11.857
this last minute?

05:11.873 --> 05:14.708
You know, I think this
could be kind of a...

05:14.743 --> 05:17.478
a fun opportunity for you to
rewrite your past a little bit.

05:17.512 --> 05:18.813
Mhmm.

05:18.847 --> 05:20.358
It's just that my
parents have spent like,

05:20.382 --> 05:22.049
an astounding amount of money on therapy

05:22.083 --> 05:23.617
to try to do that already.

05:23.652 --> 05:26.787
So forgive me for not wanting
to run back into the fire.

05:26.822 --> 05:28.126
What happened to you?

05:29.224 --> 05:30.925
Nothing, really, I just didn't like it.

05:32.309 --> 05:34.243
- Mm. Okay. Oh.
- Yeah.

05:38.767 --> 05:40.334
You might have to make more of those.

05:40.368 --> 05:42.236
- That's right.
- That's very nice.

05:54.816 --> 05:57.351
Honey, I'm home.

05:57.385 --> 05:59.787
Oh, shouldn't I be the one saying that?

05:59.821 --> 06:01.322
A little something to celebrate

06:01.356 --> 06:03.253
the end of the week.

06:03.534 --> 06:06.193
- Yeah...
- Whoop!

06:06.228 --> 06:08.629
Uh, except it's
Neuterpalooza week at work,

06:08.663 --> 06:10.364
and I still have two days

06:10.398 --> 06:11.899
of spaying and neutering ahead of me.

06:11.933 --> 06:13.667
Oh, let's stop saying "neutering",

06:13.702 --> 06:15.202
'cause it's killing my buzz!

06:15.237 --> 06:16.637
This is so silky.

06:16.671 --> 06:18.572
Yeah, it's my dad's
housecoat from storage.

06:18.607 --> 06:21.509
I was thinking we
could go as Hef, R.I.P.,

06:21.543 --> 06:23.110
and a Playboy Bunny.

06:23.144 --> 06:25.779
Isn't the theme high
school slumber party?

06:25.814 --> 06:27.181
It is.

06:27.206 --> 06:28.851
My best friend, Summer, used
to date Hef in high school,

06:28.884 --> 06:30.061
which isn't as weird as it sounds,

06:30.085 --> 06:33.120
'cause he was like, a very young 77.

06:33.154 --> 06:35.623
Uh okay, don't be mad, but...

06:35.657 --> 06:36.857
Ted, no!

06:36.892 --> 06:38.469
I have to perform surgery
on people's pets like,

06:38.493 --> 06:39.760
first thing in the morning.

06:39.794 --> 06:41.595
Why'd you have to pick this weekend?

06:41.630 --> 06:42.940
You know how much I always look forward

06:42.964 --> 06:44.465
to Patrick's house parties.

06:44.499 --> 06:47.067
Isn't this his first one?

06:47.102 --> 06:48.202
Okay, fine.

06:48.236 --> 06:51.005
I guess I'll just
finish my drink, and...

06:51.039 --> 06:52.940
wander over there dressed like this,

06:52.974 --> 06:55.175
and see what happens.

06:55.210 --> 06:57.278
Well, I mean,

06:57.312 --> 07:01.398
maybe you don't need to leave just yet.

07:01.783 --> 07:03.951
Snip, snip, Mr. Mullens!

07:05.186 --> 07:08.227
I was just hoping you
could make an exception.

07:08.690 --> 07:10.057
Let loose for one night.

07:10.091 --> 07:12.026
Next time. I promise.

07:14.996 --> 07:16.330
Moira: Well, I'm off.

07:16.364 --> 07:18.232
All right, have fun, sweetheart.

07:18.266 --> 07:20.501
You realize the bebe is crying.

07:20.535 --> 07:21.969
I do, yes.

07:22.003 --> 07:24.104
Isn't it scheduled to be dormant by now?

07:24.139 --> 07:25.873
I'll figure it out, Moira.

07:25.907 --> 07:27.808
- You have the binder.
- Yes.

07:27.842 --> 07:29.288
- Yes.
- Ooh!

07:30.145 --> 07:32.246
I think I just found the issue.

07:32.280 --> 07:33.948
It might be in the diaper.

07:33.982 --> 07:36.617
Oh, it was the bebe. I'm so relieved!

07:36.651 --> 07:38.452
Yeah, I think they left extra diapers.

07:38.486 --> 07:40.054
They assumed we'd take care of it.

07:40.088 --> 07:41.855
You wanna grab the rubber gloves?

07:41.890 --> 07:43.657
They're Tom Ford, John, no!

07:43.692 --> 07:44.969
And they wouldn't fit you anyway.

07:44.993 --> 07:47.127
The cleaning gloves under the sink!

07:47.162 --> 07:48.929
Oh! Yes.

07:55.670 --> 07:57.237
And, there.

07:57.272 --> 07:58.606
Oh, it looks like Jocelyn's

07:58.647 --> 08:01.248
left you some nice chapter tabs.

08:02.444 --> 08:05.012
Uh, it's saying here that you should...

08:05.046 --> 08:09.759
wipe counter-clockwise direction, ah...

08:09.784 --> 08:12.186
flip it, if you can flip it.

08:12.220 --> 08:14.655
- The baby?
- It doesn't say.

08:14.689 --> 08:17.224
Honestly, Moira, just go! I'll be fine.

08:17.258 --> 08:19.293
I'm not sure you will be, John.

08:19.327 --> 08:22.129
It's not like the old days
when we could just call Adelina,

08:22.163 --> 08:24.665
and have her rush home
from her daughter's wedding.

08:24.699 --> 08:26.300
You're gonna miss your screening.

08:26.334 --> 08:28.335
I'll go after the
first commercial break.

08:28.370 --> 08:30.104
That's when the action happens anyway,

08:30.138 --> 08:31.905
when my cousin and I begin

08:31.940 --> 08:33.841
our backpack through Lebanon.

08:33.875 --> 08:36.043
What else does the binder say?

08:36.077 --> 08:37.344
Oh my God, John!

08:37.379 --> 08:39.277
Don't forget to wash its hands!

08:40.715 --> 08:41.847
Okay.

08:44.052 --> 08:46.387
Okay, my turn. Ahem!

08:47.622 --> 08:50.758
Hmm, never have I ever pretended to be

08:50.792 --> 08:52.726
a pizza delivery person so I could get

08:52.761 --> 08:55.529
into Jared Leto's Halloween party.

08:55.563 --> 08:56.797
You're a bitch.

08:56.831 --> 08:59.800
My mom was engaged to
two pizza delivery guys.

08:59.834 --> 09:02.836
Can that count? 'Cause
I am really thirsty.

09:02.871 --> 09:04.538
Stevie!

09:04.572 --> 09:05.806
Uh, um...

09:08.510 --> 09:10.577
Never have I ever...

09:14.015 --> 09:15.359
Sorry, I'm just trying
to think of something

09:15.383 --> 09:17.017
- I haven't done.
- Okay.

09:17.052 --> 09:19.153
How long did you envision
this game going on for?

09:19.187 --> 09:21.121
Because never have I ever been so bored.

09:21.156 --> 09:23.323
Aw, I'm sorry, David,
when I suggested the game,

09:23.358 --> 09:26.026
I didn't expect that you'd
be drinking quite so much.

09:26.061 --> 09:27.261
Eating out of the garbage?

09:27.295 --> 09:29.163
Okay, I did that in
front of you last night.

09:29.197 --> 09:32.166
Now, as a participant, if we
don't change the game soon,

09:32.200 --> 09:34.268
- I'm gonna get very drunk.
- Oh.

09:34.302 --> 09:36.236
Yep?

09:37.439 --> 09:39.540
- Hey!
- All: Oh! There he is! Yay!

09:39.574 --> 09:41.909
God, what are you doing here?

09:41.943 --> 09:43.310
Hey, sweetie.

09:43.344 --> 09:44.689
You were right, we deserve a night out.

09:44.713 --> 09:46.914
So, I just pushed all
my morning appointments.

09:46.948 --> 09:48.415
Which will be fine, I guess,

09:48.450 --> 09:50.428
it just means that I'll be
staying up 'til 1:00 A.M.

09:50.452 --> 09:52.686
on a Saturday, spaying
with a pretty shaky hand.

09:52.721 --> 09:54.922
Mm, that's so cute. What
can I get you to drink?

09:54.956 --> 09:56.323
Oh no, don't worry about that.

09:56.357 --> 09:58.158
After you used all of
my booze for your punch,

09:58.193 --> 09:59.860
the only alcohol left in my fridge

09:59.894 --> 10:02.663
was a few of your rum,
raspberry, coconut coolers.

10:02.697 --> 10:04.531
So I polished them off, and...

10:04.566 --> 10:06.410
it tasted like burnt plastic,
and I regretted it instantly.

10:06.434 --> 10:07.634
Woman: Hi, Ted!

10:07.669 --> 10:08.979
Only you would wear a little robe,

10:09.003 --> 10:11.939
and little slippers to a
high school slumber party.

10:11.973 --> 10:14.118
Oh, no, no, no. This is just
so that I didn't get cold

10:14.142 --> 10:15.676
on the way over.

10:15.710 --> 10:17.544
All right!

10:17.579 --> 10:19.646
What is the game, because I'm up!

10:19.681 --> 10:21.115
Ohh! Wow.

10:21.149 --> 10:22.149
- Oh!
- Okay...

10:22.183 --> 10:23.951
Ted: Twyla!

10:23.985 --> 10:26.320
I'm not sure if it's
just the punch, but...

10:26.354 --> 10:28.050
he could get it!

10:28.590 --> 10:31.058
Stevie, that's disgusting.

10:31.092 --> 10:33.093
Ted, can I get you a party shot?

10:33.128 --> 10:35.028
- Cool!
- Okay.

10:35.063 --> 10:36.964
- David?
- Wow.

10:36.998 --> 10:38.332
- Yeah.
- We have orange...

10:38.357 --> 10:40.355
- I'll take that.
- Yellow...

10:52.246 --> 10:54.514
Hey! Do you wanna put
Emir away for a hot sec,

10:54.549 --> 10:57.384
so this game can keep going,
and the party can end soon?

10:57.409 --> 10:59.187
Oh, I'm good. I don't
wanna kiss anyone here.

10:59.220 --> 11:00.921
My sister's sitting in the circle,

11:00.955 --> 11:02.355
You think I'm dying to play?

11:02.390 --> 11:03.957
Thank you very much.

11:11.769 --> 11:13.837
Ohh!

11:14.168 --> 11:15.802
Oh!

11:17.728 --> 11:19.896
Okay!

11:22.276 --> 11:24.077
Babe, did you rig this?

11:24.102 --> 11:27.137
Maybe I did, and maybe I did!

11:27.181 --> 11:28.515
Ooh!

11:28.549 --> 11:31.151
- Okay, go crazy, babe.
- Mhmm.

11:31.185 --> 11:33.453
All right, who's the lucky lady?

11:35.256 --> 11:38.792
- That's offensive.
- Okay, anyway, re-spin!

11:38.826 --> 11:40.571
Yeah, it actually looks
like it sorta landed

11:40.595 --> 11:42.262
- between two people.
- No, no, no, no!

11:42.296 --> 11:43.764
I know exactly who it landed on.

11:43.798 --> 11:45.132
Oh, Ted! That's not okay.

11:45.166 --> 11:46.900
Man, come here, big guy!

11:46.934 --> 11:48.145
- Mmmph!
- Partygoers:

11:48.169 --> 11:49.803
Muah!

11:49.837 --> 11:51.698
Oh my God.

11:54.008 --> 11:55.742
It looks like the punch needs a refill.

11:55.777 --> 11:57.544
Oh hey, I could use
a refill too, big guy.

11:57.578 --> 11:59.746
Okay, I don't know where
"big guy" is coming from,

11:59.781 --> 12:01.314
but it needs to stop.

12:01.349 --> 12:05.452
Um, I don't know about
you, but I smell drama.

12:05.486 --> 12:07.220
Twyla: Okay, my turn!

12:07.255 --> 12:09.623
You know Helen, despite everything...

12:09.657 --> 12:11.158
Oh, if it weren't for Joyce Dewitt

12:11.192 --> 12:13.593
insisting on wearing those pigtails,

12:13.628 --> 12:15.857
this movie could've been a hit!

12:16.731 --> 12:18.431
We're supposed to be astrophysicists,

12:18.466 --> 12:19.699
it just takes you out of it.

12:19.734 --> 12:22.138
And yet, she, she gets the close up!

12:23.171 --> 12:25.505
- Well, that was shocking.
- I know, right?

12:25.540 --> 12:27.774
And I get the aerial
shot for my love scene.

12:27.809 --> 12:29.576
No, no, I'm talking about the kid.

12:29.610 --> 12:31.611
To think this little thing could...

12:31.646 --> 12:33.747
create so much destruction.

12:33.781 --> 12:36.416
Oh, you've completed
the diaper substitution.

12:36.450 --> 12:39.357
Aren't you the Sephardic Mr. Clean!

12:39.587 --> 12:43.021
Well, I did the kid, but
I'm not doing the bathroom.

12:43.758 --> 12:45.836
It appears you may need a
change yourself, Mr. Rose.

12:45.861 --> 12:48.362
What is that on your shoulder?

12:49.363 --> 12:51.364
Oh Moira, he spit up on me.

12:53.024 --> 12:54.891
And he's spit up in the playpen!

12:54.916 --> 12:57.851
Ew! That cannot be good, John!

12:57.876 --> 13:01.083
Its body is ejecting things,
what did you do to it?!

13:01.108 --> 13:03.677
Nothing! I-I changed
his diaper, that's all.

13:03.711 --> 13:06.213
Well, perhaps you've swaddled
its abdomen too tightly,

13:06.238 --> 13:09.106
Or maybe it's allergic to something.

13:09.150 --> 13:11.251
John, did you feed it shellfish?

13:11.285 --> 13:12.719
What did you do?!

13:12.753 --> 13:15.088
I've gotta wipe him up, and
change his clothes again.

13:15.122 --> 13:17.657
For all we know, it's
got crawling pneumonia.

13:17.692 --> 13:20.227
Oh, he doesn't have
crawling pneumonia, Moira!

13:20.261 --> 13:21.895
I don't want to say I told you so,

13:21.929 --> 13:23.563
but this is an infelicitous burden.

13:23.598 --> 13:25.398
I could be at Ronnie's right now,

13:25.433 --> 13:27.834
preparing for the post-screening Q&A.

13:27.869 --> 13:29.603
Well then, go to Ronnie's!

13:29.637 --> 13:32.372
Because I've gotta get
him a change of clothes.

13:32.406 --> 13:34.608
Well, at least put the gloves back on.

13:36.911 --> 13:38.478
John, it says right here,

13:38.512 --> 13:40.695
spitting up is normal.

13:42.183 --> 13:44.703
Jocelyn's written, "Spit happens."

13:45.620 --> 13:46.586
Very clever.

13:47.688 --> 13:48.914
For Jocelyn.

13:53.794 --> 13:55.528
Oh my God, they just need to chill.

13:55.563 --> 13:56.763
David: Okay, I'm done.

13:56.797 --> 13:58.431
Who chose this theme, anyway?

13:58.466 --> 14:00.500
It was a mistake.

14:00.534 --> 14:02.669
What are you guys doing over here?

14:02.703 --> 14:04.804
You remind me of me at
a high school house party

14:04.839 --> 14:06.606
judging all the
attractive and popular kids

14:06.641 --> 14:08.375
for being attractive and popular.

14:08.409 --> 14:10.143
David, do you have
anything you wanna say

14:10.177 --> 14:12.579
- to me and Patrick?
- Actually, yes.

14:12.613 --> 14:14.481
Now, as an attractive and popular kid

14:14.515 --> 14:16.917
at a house party, I can confidently say,

14:16.951 --> 14:19.386
- it's very fun.
- That's it?

14:19.420 --> 14:21.254
That's all you have to say?

14:21.289 --> 14:22.722
What's going on here?

14:22.757 --> 14:24.324
Mm, things got effed,

14:24.358 --> 14:26.293
and we're not having fun anymore.

14:26.327 --> 14:28.895
For what it's worth,
I'm having a great time.

14:28.930 --> 14:30.297
You're like a tsetse fly.

14:30.331 --> 14:31.964
Where's your cell phone boyfriend?

14:32.199 --> 14:34.401
- On my cell phone.
- Okay.

14:34.435 --> 14:35.869
You're not having fun?

14:35.903 --> 14:38.042
I don't know David, sure.

14:38.339 --> 14:40.540
What exactly did I do wrong here?

14:40.574 --> 14:42.208
Oh, I don't know. David,

14:42.243 --> 14:44.177
mmm, was it the time
you kissed my boyfriend?

14:44.211 --> 14:47.547
Or... was it the time
you kissed my boyfriend?

14:47.581 --> 14:49.459
I think it was the time
you kissed her boyfriend.

14:49.483 --> 14:51.618
Okay, he kissed me!

14:51.652 --> 14:53.687
And I was just told to have some fun.

14:53.721 --> 14:55.162
So I played the game.

14:55.187 --> 14:57.123
I'm sorry that the bottle landed on me.

14:57.158 --> 14:59.392
Hm, technically it landed
between you and Stevie, so.

14:59.417 --> 15:00.310
Yeah.

15:00.335 --> 15:02.239
Okay, so you're upset
about this as well, then?

15:02.263 --> 15:03.573
- Looks like it.
- Patrick: No, I'm not!

15:03.597 --> 15:05.465
I'm not upset. I just, I guess I wonder

15:05.499 --> 15:08.034
how you would react if
the tables were turned.

15:08.069 --> 15:09.346
Yeah David, like, what would you do

15:09.370 --> 15:11.738
if Patrick and I suddenly
kissed at a party?

15:11.772 --> 15:13.239
- Yeah.
- Or Patrick and me.

15:13.274 --> 15:15.044
Okay, we're done with you.

15:15.343 --> 15:16.609
It was spin the bottle!

15:16.644 --> 15:19.446
If Patrick was wasted,
and spun the bottle,

15:19.480 --> 15:21.715
and it landed on you,
and you guys kissed,

15:21.749 --> 15:24.217
- I wouldn't care.
- You're lying, David.

15:24.251 --> 15:25.752
Okay, is that what needs to happen

15:25.786 --> 15:27.821
to clear the air here?
You guys need to kiss?

15:27.855 --> 15:29.499
- David, let's not be dramatic.
- Yeah, maybe it does.

15:29.523 --> 15:31.091
- What?
- Well, by all means.

15:31.125 --> 15:33.036
I think it's actually more
the principle of the thing...

15:33.060 --> 15:35.061
- Okay, here we go.
- Hmm!

15:38.499 --> 15:40.667
Is that really...

15:40.701 --> 15:43.294
Uh huh.

15:43.838 --> 15:45.905
Mmm! Mmmm!

15:48.075 --> 15:50.410
Mmmmmmmm!

15:50.444 --> 15:52.679
Yum. That was fun.

15:52.713 --> 15:54.914
Hey, are we spinning more bottles?

15:54.949 --> 15:56.249
Uh, was that fun for you guys?

15:56.283 --> 15:59.419
- That like, satisfying?
- I was never not okay. So.

15:59.453 --> 16:02.188
It was really good for me.

16:02.223 --> 16:03.590
I say we play truth or dare.

16:03.624 --> 16:05.091
Oh Stevie, I'm in!

16:05.126 --> 16:06.740
Oh no, Ted.

16:07.161 --> 16:08.472
Get your housecoat
and your other slipper.

16:08.496 --> 16:10.818
It is time to go.

16:11.065 --> 16:12.966
- You got it, big guy.
- Okay.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.335
Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry.

16:15.369 --> 16:16.836
Good game!

16:19.230 --> 16:20.505
Look at him.

16:21.591 --> 16:23.771
Awful peaceful when he's sleeping.

16:29.050 --> 16:30.990
Well, we did it, sweetheart.

16:31.617 --> 16:33.985
And, uh...

16:34.145 --> 16:36.379
what do you think we've
learned here today?

16:36.524 --> 16:39.115
That Adelina was grossly underpaid.

16:39.759 --> 16:42.828
No, I mean, we could've been good,

16:42.924 --> 16:45.325
hands-on parents if we wanted to.

16:45.493 --> 16:46.960
We've got it in us.

16:46.986 --> 16:48.787
That was never in question, John.

16:48.869 --> 16:51.538
I'm even more convinced
that our hands-off approach

16:51.563 --> 16:52.997
served them better.

16:53.040 --> 16:56.176
I'll go, but not without my cousin!

16:56.201 --> 16:58.169
That had its moments.

16:58.212 --> 17:01.214
When it shone, it shone brightly.

17:01.248 --> 17:03.183
And I have to hand it to DeWitt.

17:03.217 --> 17:05.761
She had a real breakthrough
during the denouement.

17:06.353 --> 17:09.489
I believe she believed we were cousins.

17:11.855 --> 17:13.856
John?

17:22.368 --> 17:24.270
- Roland: Oh, hello!
- Moira: Shh! Shh! Shh!

17:24.305 --> 17:26.473
- Greet... what?!
- Shh!

17:26.507 --> 17:28.474
- What?
- I just put him down!

17:28.509 --> 17:31.277
Oh my gosh, you got
little Roland Jr. to sleep?

17:31.312 --> 17:32.745
Oh no, I'm talking about John.

17:32.780 --> 17:33.409
Oh.

17:33.475 --> 17:35.800
No, Roland's been asleep
for quite some time.

17:35.825 --> 17:38.059
And everything was
fine? No major problems?

17:38.084 --> 17:41.353
He is a slice of meringue, Jocelyn.

17:41.531 --> 17:43.999
You know, I don't know if uh...

17:44.024 --> 17:46.526
I'm just all zen'd out
from an hour and a half

17:46.560 --> 17:49.129
of Linda's magic fingers on me,

17:49.163 --> 17:52.398
but I can actually see
myself leaving Roland Jr.

17:52.433 --> 17:53.666
With you people more often.

17:53.701 --> 17:55.464
Ah!

17:55.703 --> 17:57.414
Well, that something
Linda might want to massage

17:57.439 --> 18:00.007
right out of your mind,
the next appointment.

18:00.032 --> 18:01.633
I actually have Ron the next time,

18:01.675 --> 18:04.003
we like to mix it up a little bit.

18:05.114 --> 18:06.825
And with that, I believe
your little inchling

18:06.850 --> 18:09.452
is out past its curfew.

18:09.650 --> 18:11.651
Oh, you get the binger,
I'll get the baby.

18:11.685 --> 18:13.510
Okay.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.261
Ohh, jeez.

18:16.286 --> 18:17.819
Look at him.

18:18.092 --> 18:20.793
You know, I almost think I like
him better asleep than awake.

18:25.963 --> 18:29.399
He's on my side.

18:30.137 --> 18:31.504
Bye bye.

18:33.346 --> 18:34.913
What?

18:35.418 --> 18:37.619
Oh, shh!

18:46.720 --> 18:48.365
Ahem! I'm just gonna
take the garbage out.

18:48.389 --> 18:49.722
Okay.

18:49.747 --> 18:50.991
Yeah, and if I don't come back,

18:51.025 --> 18:53.226
it's probably because
I've run off with Ted.

18:53.260 --> 18:55.028
Thanks for the heads up.

18:55.062 --> 18:56.362
We're just gonna go for a ride,

18:56.397 --> 18:57.630
see where it takes us.

18:57.665 --> 18:59.899
Maybe start a vet clinic
somewhere along the way.

18:59.934 --> 19:02.302
He'll the animals back to heath, I'll...

19:02.327 --> 19:04.195
offer grooming services.

19:04.238 --> 19:06.504
Okay, you know what?

19:07.920 --> 19:10.655
Maybe I overreacted for a second.

19:10.680 --> 19:13.079
I was just talking to Alexis,

19:13.113 --> 19:14.524
and we sorta wound each other worked up.

19:14.548 --> 19:16.316
- And Stevie didn't help.
- Stevie never helps.

19:16.350 --> 19:19.018
So I didn't love seeing my boyfriend

19:19.043 --> 19:21.277
kissing some other guy.

19:21.322 --> 19:23.371
I'm sorry, are you
saying you were jealous?

19:24.325 --> 19:26.626
David, I'm not playing
this game with you.

19:26.660 --> 19:28.127
No, you just said you didn't like

19:28.162 --> 19:30.230
seeing your boyfriend
kissing another guy.

19:30.264 --> 19:32.198
Okay, fine. He's a handsome guy.

19:32.233 --> 19:33.476
I might've been a little jealous.

19:33.500 --> 19:34.844
So, you think he's handsome then?

19:34.868 --> 19:37.570
What? He's like-he goes to the gym.

19:37.605 --> 19:39.272
- Goes to the gym?
- Oh my God.

19:39.306 --> 19:41.908
Wow, okay, so when you
said you were jealous,

19:41.942 --> 19:44.177
were you saying you were jealous of him,

19:44.211 --> 19:45.578
or jealous of me?

19:45.613 --> 19:48.653
Because I thought you were
saying you were jealous of him.

19:49.416 --> 19:50.683
Both?

19:50.718 --> 19:52.185
Not the answer I was looking for.

19:52.219 --> 19:53.184
Hey.

19:54.655 --> 19:55.922
Mhmm?

19:55.947 --> 19:57.091
I wonder what would've happened

19:57.116 --> 19:59.784
- if we had met in high school.
- Hmm.

19:59.827 --> 20:02.996
Well, unless you were into candy ravers

20:03.021 --> 20:04.722
with asymmetrical haircuts

20:04.765 --> 20:06.499
and a lot of pacifier necklaces,

20:06.524 --> 20:08.525
I think our paths
crossed at the right time.

20:13.222 --> 20:14.556
How jealous, though?

20:14.581 --> 20:16.282
Why don't you take out the garbage?

20:16.443 --> 20:18.645
- How jealous were you?
- Nope!

20:18.670 --> 20:20.804
Scale of one to ten.

20:20.848 --> 20:23.316
- Like, enraged, or...
- Bye, bye.

20:23.350 --> 20:25.151
Like fuming, did you sweat?

20:28.231 --> 20:30.684
- That was fun.
- Yes

20:30.709 --> 20:34.233
- That was really fun. Did you have fun?
- Yes.

20:34.270 --> 20:36.538
- Did everyone had fun?
- Yes, Ted.

20:36.572 --> 20:39.674
That's good, it's good
that everyone had fun.

20:39.709 --> 20:41.119
Okay, you still have your slippers on,

20:41.143 --> 20:42.788
Yeah, I know, sometimes
my feet get really cold

20:42.812 --> 20:45.380
- when I drink too much.
- It's not a thing.

20:45.414 --> 20:47.382
- Okay, well, gimme a kiss.
- No!

20:47.416 --> 20:49.050
You kissed my brother tonight,

20:49.085 --> 20:51.086
I'm not kissing you after
you kissed my brother.

20:51.120 --> 20:53.888
Pffft! Who kissed your brother?

20:53.923 --> 20:56.825
Okay, it's time for "Fun
Ted" to just pass out.

20:56.859 --> 20:59.260
No, he's not even tired.
In fact, if anything,

20:59.295 --> 21:02.097
I'd say he's only becoming more fun.

21:02.131 --> 21:04.265
Okay. Okay! Okay! Okay!

21:04.300 --> 21:07.302
I think we should just
like, sleep it off.

21:07.336 --> 21:09.371
Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah.

21:09.415 --> 21:11.549
But first just give your brother a kiss.

21:11.574 --> 21:13.074
- Ew, Ted, Ew!
- Come on.

21:13.109 --> 21:15.677
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!

21:15.711 --> 21:18.380
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! That's you.
