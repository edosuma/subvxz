WEBVTT

00:23.816 --> 00:25.183
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

00:25.217 --> 00:26.451
Give it to house management.

00:26.819 --> 00:28.620
And these...

00:30.723 --> 00:32.457
Okay, well, thank you.
I'll be...

00:32.491 --> 00:33.693
- All right.
- Yeah. I'll just be a minute.

00:33.726 --> 00:35.728
- I'll be right back.
- See ya.

01:00.385 --> 01:02.755
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a 7 o'clock half hour</i>

01:02.789 --> 01:04.589
<i>for a 7:30 show this evening.</i>

01:04.623 --> 01:07.359
<i>Just a reminder that
when you get out of clothes,</i>

01:07.392 --> 01:11.864
<i>please join us upstairs in the
lobby for a little... send off.</i>

01:11.898 --> 01:13.198
<i>Farewell.</i>

01:23.275 --> 01:25.410
<i>Okay. I just wanna
take everybody back</i>

01:25.444 --> 01:28.715
<i>to the time when these two met.</i>

01:28.748 --> 01:33.653
Jen comes to me and she says,
"Dad, listen, I met this guy,

01:33.686 --> 01:36.254
"and he's all alone
for the holidays.

01:36.288 --> 01:38.825
"And he's a sailor."
And I say, "No."

01:38.858 --> 01:40.026
"No, no, no, no, no."

01:40.059 --> 01:41.861
She says "Oh, Dad, please.
Come on.

01:41.894 --> 01:44.496
"He's separated from his family.

01:44.529 --> 01:46.866
"Can I please invite him
for Christmas?"

01:47.734 --> 01:48.768
And I said yes.

01:48.801 --> 01:50.502
Well, well, no, no.

01:50.535 --> 01:52.537
Pat and I said yes.

01:53.806 --> 01:56.943
And, boy, are we glad we did.

01:56.976 --> 02:00.278
You two chose each other
to be family.

02:00.312 --> 02:02.314
I mean, poor Jen.
When I think of it,

02:02.347 --> 02:04.717
stuck with me and Pat.
No choice.

02:04.751 --> 02:05.785
No choice at all.

02:06.886 --> 02:08.020
But David,

02:08.721 --> 02:10.757
Jen chose you.

02:12.324 --> 02:13.626
So be her rock.

02:14.794 --> 02:16.729
Be her soft place to fall.

02:16.763 --> 02:18.765
Huh?

02:18.798 --> 02:21.934
And for God's sake, be the one
to make her wear a life vest.

02:23.368 --> 02:25.337
At all times, even on land.

02:27.372 --> 02:29.976
A toast to Mr. and Mrs. Munroe.

02:30.009 --> 02:34.412
May you always be as in love
as you are today.

02:34.446 --> 02:35.681
I love you.

02:36.816 --> 02:38.283
Cheers. Cheers.

02:39.351 --> 02:40.352
Cheers.

02:57.904 --> 03:00.039
That's allowing me
to somehow be okay

03:00.072 --> 03:01.641
with standing here
in front of you

03:01.674 --> 03:03.743
telling you that unless
you fight for me,

03:03.776 --> 03:05.812
now, I am walking away.

03:05.845 --> 03:08.114
I won't sit back
and wait for you.

03:08.147 --> 03:10.716
If that's what I think it is,
we could just fucking go home now.

03:10.750 --> 03:12.450
- Great.
- Yeah.

03:12.484 --> 03:13.653
Thanks.

03:16.756 --> 03:18.523
- Thank you.
- Great job.

03:18.557 --> 03:20.726
- Appreciate it. Thank you.
- Thank you for being here.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.829
Bye, Nigel.
It's so good to see you.

03:22.862 --> 03:25.497
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

03:25.530 --> 03:27.633
Bye, Nigel, I'll see you.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.402
God.

03:32.537 --> 03:35.607
Oh, my God. I'm so happy
to see you.

03:35.641 --> 03:37.743
- I am so happy to see you too.
- How are you?

03:37.777 --> 03:40.079
- I'm great. How are you?
- I'm good.

03:40.112 --> 03:42.048
Holy shit, you were slaying it
in there.

03:42.081 --> 03:43.515
I was, like, crying
listening to you.

03:43.548 --> 03:46.551
Thank you. No, this material,
and that place,

03:46.585 --> 03:48.386
- the grapple, right?
- It's really powerful.

03:48.420 --> 03:50.388
You have to just
drop down into it.

03:50.422 --> 03:51.489
Yeah. Yeah, you...

03:51.523 --> 03:52.825
Have you worked
with Nigel before?

03:52.859 --> 03:54.126
No. No.

03:54.160 --> 03:56.461
The nicest guy. Are you next?

03:56.494 --> 03:58.965
No. God, no.
I'm 40 minutes early.

03:58.998 --> 04:00.066
Like a jackass.

04:00.099 --> 04:02.168
Yeah. I like to just show up
way too fucking early

04:02.201 --> 04:04.737
and watch all the other
actresses go in and be brilliant.

04:04.770 --> 04:06.072
Lose all my self-confidence.

04:06.105 --> 04:08.641
Oh, shut up.
This outfit looks perfect.

04:08.674 --> 04:10.609
Right? I borrowed this
from my roommate.

04:10.643 --> 04:11.744
This is my...

04:11.777 --> 04:12.979
"I used to be
a decent piece of ass,

04:13.012 --> 04:14.613
"but now, I'm invisible 'cause
my husband dumped me" look.

04:16.983 --> 04:18.150
Jennie?

04:18.184 --> 04:19.952
- You ready?
- Uh, yeah, I just...

04:19.986 --> 04:22.088
No, no, no, we're going
by scheduled times.

04:22.121 --> 04:23.521
- Okay.
- Jennie, sorry.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.557
- Didn't see you.
- That's okay. Hi.

04:25.590 --> 04:27.693
- Come on in, sweetie.
- All right.

04:27.727 --> 04:29.028
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

04:29.061 --> 04:30.963
- Thanks for coming in.
- Sure.

04:30.997 --> 04:33.866
Nigel, this is Jennie Munroe.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.868
You might have
remembered her from the...

04:35.902 --> 04:39.071
Oh, of course. I saw you
in <i>The Acorn</i> last year.

04:39.105 --> 04:40.472
- Oh.
- You were great.

04:40.505 --> 04:42.440
Thank you.
Thanks so much.

04:42.474 --> 04:44.644
Toby will read
Alexander for you.

04:44.677 --> 04:49.949
Uh, we're going to go back
just a little bit from, uh...

04:49.982 --> 04:51.651
"I, Alexander,
take thee, Delaney."

04:51.684 --> 04:52.985
Oh, okay.

04:53.019 --> 04:55.788
Yeah. From the, uh, flashbacks,

04:56.188 --> 04:57.422
to the vows.

04:57.455 --> 05:01.827
That way, it'll just help you
to launch yourself a little bit.

05:01.861 --> 05:03.595
Great, great, great. That's...

05:07.767 --> 05:11.503
"I, Alexander, take thee,
Delaney, to be my wife.

05:11.536 --> 05:15.141
"To have and to hold,
to love, honor and cherish,

05:15.174 --> 05:17.810
"from this day forward."

05:17.843 --> 05:20.246
I, Delaney,
take thee, Alexander,

05:20.279 --> 05:21.513
to be my husband.

05:22.214 --> 05:23.683
To honor...

05:25.885 --> 05:27.585
To honor, cherish...

05:29.689 --> 05:30.923
Hey, babe.

05:33.025 --> 05:35.527
Who... Whose number...

05:36.362 --> 05:38.097
Who do you know
with a 407 number?

05:39.298 --> 05:41.667
Four-O...

05:41.701 --> 05:43.936
Who do you know
with a 407 number?

05:43.970 --> 05:45.237
Nobody.

05:46.806 --> 05:49.241
I think you do.

05:49.275 --> 05:52.778
Whoever it is, it's somebody you've
spoken to at least once a day,

05:52.812 --> 05:55.081
every single day
for the last 30 days.

05:56.148 --> 05:58.050
Are those
my phone records? Or...

05:59.151 --> 06:00.152
Who?

06:01.654 --> 06:05.057
Oh, uh, right.
She's just a friend.

06:11.864 --> 06:14.266
She's just a friend I met.

06:15.034 --> 06:16.135
Where?

06:16.168 --> 06:17.636
Fort Pierce.

06:18.838 --> 06:20.505
When I delivered the boat.

06:39.825 --> 06:41.260
...to have and to hold.

06:41.293 --> 06:42.795
Ugh.

06:42.828 --> 06:44.163
Sorry about that.

06:44.196 --> 06:45.965
Do you mind if I just...
I'm just gonna go back.

06:45.998 --> 06:47.666
- If that's okay.
- Of course.

06:47.700 --> 06:51.637
Dropped the easiest line
in the whole play.

06:52.738 --> 06:54.606
Everyone knows it.
Even my parents.

06:54.640 --> 06:55.841
Okay.

06:57.643 --> 07:00.346
These are "My husband
just dumped me" pants.

07:00.379 --> 07:01.881
Throwing me off.

07:02.348 --> 07:04.884
Here we go. Um...

07:10.923 --> 07:13.159
"I, Alexander,
take thee, Delaney,

07:13.192 --> 07:14.860
"to be my wife.

07:14.894 --> 07:17.930
"To have and to hold,
to love, honor and cherish

07:17.963 --> 07:20.199
"from this day forward."

07:20.232 --> 07:23.135
I, Delaney,
take thee, Alexander,

07:23.169 --> 07:24.303
to be my husband.

07:25.905 --> 07:27.306
To have and to hold,

07:28.707 --> 07:30.776
from this day forward.

07:39.085 --> 07:40.853
Okay. All right.

07:40.886 --> 07:44.256
No, wait. Let's do two.
Uh, one serious and one funny.

07:55.101 --> 07:56.936
Okay.

07:58.838 --> 08:00.106
Okay.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.708
Uh, funny first.

08:02.741 --> 08:04.210
Yep. Funny first.

08:04.243 --> 08:05.344
There you go.

08:14.220 --> 08:15.254
Okay.

08:28.467 --> 08:29.969
It's beautiful.

08:30.002 --> 08:31.270
Thank you.

08:32.404 --> 08:34.140
Happy anniversary.

08:35.474 --> 08:37.109
- I'm sorry I can't afford more.
- Not now, David.

08:37.143 --> 08:38.344
- You deserve more.
- Stop it.

08:38.377 --> 08:41.013
We've spent all of our money
so that we could move here.

08:41.046 --> 08:43.048
I don't want anything else.
I just want you.

08:43.082 --> 08:44.350
- You do?
- I do.

08:52.458 --> 08:54.793
Come on.
Come on, we just broke it.

09:18.284 --> 09:20.286
Jennie, David, come in.

09:22.821 --> 09:24.857
And I just... I-I...

09:24.890 --> 09:27.059
I know that it's about
the timing of all this,

09:27.092 --> 09:28.928
you know, with this...
with this other woman.

09:28.961 --> 09:30.162
- So, um...
- The affair?

09:30.196 --> 09:31.797
Yes, and I-I...

09:31.830 --> 09:35.234
I know that we're scared
that we're, both scared,

09:35.267 --> 09:37.069
- but I just...
- Is that true, David?

09:38.337 --> 09:40.439
What? That we're scared?

09:40.472 --> 09:42.308
Are you scared?

09:42.341 --> 09:44.176
She's always scared.

09:45.144 --> 09:46.145
Are you?

09:48.547 --> 09:49.815
I guess so.

09:51.517 --> 09:52.718
You guess so?

09:53.419 --> 09:54.420
Yep.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.925
Can you tell me
what else you might be feeling?

10:02.394 --> 10:04.863
Jennie mentioned
that you seemed angry...

10:06.165 --> 10:07.800
at her.

10:08.367 --> 10:10.402
Is that true?

10:10.436 --> 10:12.071
- Is that even...
- Jennie.

10:12.104 --> 10:14.373
Sorry. Sorry.
Sorry, babe.

10:17.142 --> 10:18.410
David,

10:18.444 --> 10:19.912
are you angry?

10:23.015 --> 10:24.483
I don't know.

10:27.353 --> 10:29.154
At, at me?

10:29.188 --> 10:30.456
At Jennie, David.

10:33.192 --> 10:34.927
What are you so angry about?

10:39.898 --> 10:41.834
In my experience,

10:41.867 --> 10:45.004
- when people refuse to speak...
- I don't wanna be a dad.

10:50.309 --> 10:52.044
If that's what you were asking.

11:05.291 --> 11:06.992
- Get it?
- No, I got it, it's all right.

11:11.864 --> 11:12.898
- Hey!
- Hey!

11:12.931 --> 11:14.400
Merry Christmas.

11:18.070 --> 11:20.239
We were so worried
about you guys.

11:20.272 --> 11:22.141
We didn't hear that
you had landed okay.

11:22.174 --> 11:23.976
I think you would've heard
something on the news if we didn't.

11:24.009 --> 11:25.477
- Let me help you.
- No, Dad.

11:25.511 --> 11:27.079
- I'm taking the light one.
- All right, yeah.

11:27.112 --> 11:28.347
I'm dying for you
to see the tree.

11:28.380 --> 11:29.982
Babe,
why don't we just...

11:30.015 --> 11:31.483
You got something
for your folks, right?

11:31.517 --> 11:32.551
- Yeah.
- So let's just

11:32.584 --> 11:34.887
figure out something we need
for the apartment...

11:34.920 --> 11:36.121
- No. No!
- ...get it online.

11:36.155 --> 11:38.223
- That's not romantic.
- I don't even know what you want.

11:38.257 --> 11:40.292
You don't tell me.
What do you want?

11:43.429 --> 11:45.130
I want a baby.

11:47.599 --> 11:49.468
A what?

11:49.501 --> 11:51.970
I want a baby for Christmas.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.275
Jennie?

11:56.942 --> 11:58.477
Yeah?

11:58.510 --> 11:59.511
Are you serious?

12:00.179 --> 12:01.280
Yeah.

12:02.514 --> 12:03.982
I thought we didn't
want a baby.

12:04.016 --> 12:05.451
I know, but I do, now.

12:05.484 --> 12:07.019
Now, I do.

12:07.953 --> 12:10.589
- Jen.
- I just...

12:10.622 --> 12:12.624
I know it sounds weird,
but I keep seeing

12:12.659 --> 12:14.960
these beautiful little
badass girls

12:14.993 --> 12:17.329
that look right at me. Like,
"What are you doing?"

12:17.363 --> 12:20.399
"Who are you gonna share
your whatever with?

12:20.432 --> 12:22.401
"Your... your anything?"

12:24.269 --> 12:27.573
We're pushing 40,
what if we just...

12:27.606 --> 12:30.542
for one year, got out of the way,
to see if it was meant to be.

12:33.178 --> 12:34.313
<i>Just one year?</i>

12:49.662 --> 12:51.296
I'm not going back there.

12:55.134 --> 12:57.369
<i>Hey, Jennifer Munroe.</i>

12:57.403 --> 13:00.406
<i>Listen, I'm doing what you
asked, I'm giving you space</i>

13:00.439 --> 13:01.273
<i>for him to step up.</i>

13:01.306 --> 13:03.442
<i>But I swear to God,
if he doesn't,</i>

13:03.475 --> 13:05.611
<i>in a big fucking way
real, real soon,</i>

13:05.645 --> 13:09.581
<i>I will, I don't know,
maybe I'll cash out my IRA</i>

13:09.615 --> 13:11.049
<i>and put a hit out on him.</i>

13:11.083 --> 13:13.519
<i>That would be
a great use of my money.</i>

13:13.552 --> 13:15.154
<i>You know I'm kidding, right?</i>

13:15.187 --> 13:16.288
<i>I kid, because I love.</i>

13:16.321 --> 13:18.424
<i>I'm sort of kidding,
but seriously,</i>

13:18.457 --> 13:21.260
<i>just say the word,
and I am there.</i>

13:21.293 --> 13:23.362
<i>Okay? I love you.</i>

13:36.608 --> 13:37.744
<i>He was all proud like,</i>

13:37.777 --> 13:39.712
and he says,
"What do you think, Stan?"

13:39.746 --> 13:41.681
And I say, "Are you
fucking kidding me?

13:41.714 --> 13:45.284
"4.5 mil for that piece of shit?
You're an idiot!"

13:45.317 --> 13:48.187
I couldn't help myself.
I said it right to his face.

13:48.220 --> 13:49.488
Uh, mint?

13:50.055 --> 13:51.356
No? Okay.

13:51.390 --> 13:53.225
Anyhoo, back to youse two.

13:53.525 --> 13:55.327
So, wow!

13:55.360 --> 13:57.329
Wow.

13:57.362 --> 13:59.666
Well, based on my, what,
50 minutes with you,

13:59.699 --> 14:03.670
my overall quick analysis
is that,

14:03.703 --> 14:06.104
this marriage is on thin ice.

14:06.138 --> 14:09.241
But, it can be saved.

14:11.376 --> 14:12.645
I mean, this one.

14:12.679 --> 14:14.781
Desperate, controlling,
terrified.

14:14.814 --> 14:16.181
Not a good sign.

14:16.215 --> 14:19.251
And this one.
Silent, brooding, secretive.

14:19.719 --> 14:22.154
Also not good.

14:22.187 --> 14:25.057
Kids. We got our work
cut out for us.

14:25.658 --> 14:28.093
So, when's the baby due?

14:32.331 --> 14:34.066
I am not going back there.

14:34.099 --> 14:35.300
Yeah?

14:35.869 --> 14:38.036
You would go back to him?

14:50.382 --> 14:51.383
They call?

14:55.554 --> 14:56.756
Is it bad?

15:03.328 --> 15:05.130
<i>Hi, Jennie, this is April,</i>

15:05.163 --> 15:07.466
<i>the genetic counselor
from Dr. Bennett's office.</i>

15:07.499 --> 15:10.803
<i>The lab did confirm the presence
of an extra chromosome 18</i>

15:10.837 --> 15:12.538
<i>in all the cells
that they looked at.</i>

15:12.571 --> 15:16.508
<i>So, your next step would be
to contact your OB-GYN</i>

15:16.542 --> 15:18.645
<i>since the pregnancy
isn't viable.</i>

15:18.678 --> 15:21.648
<i>I hope we see you again</i>

15:21.681 --> 15:23.650
<i>and are able to give you
good news.</i>

15:23.683 --> 15:26.719
<i>If you guys wanna,
wanna try again or...</i>

15:27.820 --> 15:30.723
<i>All right, take care. Bye.</i>

15:34.894 --> 15:36.094
Fuck.

15:45.237 --> 15:47.506
You want to wear cowboy boots
with a skirt?

15:47.539 --> 15:48.741
- Yeah.
- That's not a goal.

15:48.775 --> 15:49.642
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

15:49.676 --> 15:50.643
- It is. It's a goal.
- It is not a goal.

15:50.677 --> 15:53.612
- You already do that.
- No, not with a skirt.

15:53.646 --> 15:56.615
I wear 'em with pants, not a skirt.
It's different.

15:56.649 --> 15:58.851
That is totally hot.
You can cross that off tonight.

15:58.885 --> 16:00.185
It's an easy one.

16:00.218 --> 16:01.587
- My turn.
- Okay.

16:03.589 --> 16:04.791
All right.

16:14.299 --> 16:15.868
You want to make...

16:16.669 --> 16:18.671
- a limbo...
- Living.

16:18.705 --> 16:23.442
Living. You want to
make a living... on a boat?

16:24.343 --> 16:26.411
- If I could.
- You could totally do that.

16:26.445 --> 16:27.546
I don't know
how much money's in it,

16:27.579 --> 16:30.482
- but if I could, I would.
- You totally could do that.

16:30.515 --> 16:32.484
- All right, you go.
- Okay.

16:33.251 --> 16:34.519
Okay.

16:35.655 --> 16:36.723
Thailand.

16:37.489 --> 16:38.791
Thailand.

16:38.825 --> 16:40.525
Yeah. Would you
write that down, please.

16:40.559 --> 16:42.260
- Thailand?
- Yeah. Thailand.

16:42.294 --> 16:43.830
- What about it?
- I'm going.

16:43.863 --> 16:45.932
- When?
- Someday.

16:45.965 --> 16:47.466
- How?
- It's a goal.

16:47.499 --> 16:50.235
- You're terrified to fly over an ocean.
- I know.

16:50.268 --> 16:51.536
- I know.
- So when did this...

16:51.570 --> 16:52.839
- I...
- I've never...

16:52.872 --> 16:54.841
Miss Tucker,
my third grade teacher.

16:54.874 --> 16:58.410
She had this shiny
gold Buddha on her desk

16:58.443 --> 16:59.846
that I was obsessed with.

16:59.879 --> 17:03.448
And then, finally, she gave it to
me on the last day before summer.

17:03.482 --> 17:05.283
She told me
about her travels to Thailand.

17:05.317 --> 17:06.786
She was amazing.
She...

17:07.519 --> 17:09.221
She was was tough.

17:09.254 --> 17:11.924
She was was tough.
She wore slacks.

17:11.958 --> 17:16.194
She traveled on her own.
She was an adventurer.

17:16.796 --> 17:18.397
I want to do that.

17:19.231 --> 17:20.767
Do you still have it?

17:20.800 --> 17:23.502
- What?
- The Buddha.

17:23.535 --> 17:25.738
I think I do.
I think it's at my parents.

17:27.907 --> 17:29.642
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

17:29.676 --> 17:31.410
I'm gonna write it down.

17:31.443 --> 17:32.779
Jennie...

17:34.881 --> 17:38.283
...is gonna fly...

17:38.985 --> 17:40.753
...over an ocean...

17:42.554 --> 17:44.222
...to Thailand.

17:44.256 --> 17:45.557
Yep.

17:47.526 --> 17:49.261
It's official.

18:02.307 --> 18:03.508
David.

18:05.444 --> 18:06.846
David.

18:07.747 --> 18:08.915
What?

18:10.515 --> 18:11.918
Did you dance with her?

18:16.321 --> 18:17.924
At the place? Did you dance?

18:17.957 --> 18:19.257
What, Jennie?

18:20.392 --> 18:22.227
Did you dance together?

18:29.367 --> 18:30.569
Yes.

18:31.637 --> 18:33.271
You did?

18:37.375 --> 18:38.811
Was it a slow song?

18:41.914 --> 18:43.015
Yes.

18:45.017 --> 18:46.886
Do you remember the song?

18:50.089 --> 18:51.356
No.

18:53.860 --> 18:55.928
It was slow though?

19:23.421 --> 19:26.458
Now, you've been
turning down auditions?

19:27.860 --> 19:29.294
Uh, yeah.

19:29.594 --> 19:31.396
Why?

19:31.429 --> 19:33.498
Well, not the day player stuff.

19:33.532 --> 19:36.702
The small, the out-of-town gigs...
the out-of-town theater jobs.

19:36.736 --> 19:38.070
- Yes.
- Why?

19:38.104 --> 19:42.842
Well, I don't think that us being
apart is a really good idea.

19:42.875 --> 19:45.011
I think that David and I

19:45.044 --> 19:48.748
need to be in the same place,
and not miles apart for months

19:48.781 --> 19:50.817
while our marriage is
barely hanging on.

19:52.018 --> 19:55.420
I see, so you don't
want him to go either.

19:55.453 --> 19:59.591
Uh, do you not want him to even try
and get work in Florida this winter?

20:00.425 --> 20:02.995
I don't know, I...

20:03.029 --> 20:07.633
No, I think we need to be
in the same city for a while.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.601
So you want to play the martyr

20:09.635 --> 20:11.103
and give up what you love...

20:11.137 --> 20:14.073
- Martyr?
- ...and asked him to put his life on hold?

20:14.106 --> 20:19.578
You know, this all seems
very "Gift of the Magi" to me.

20:19.611 --> 20:21.080
You know that story, David.

20:21.113 --> 20:22.915
Are you familiar with that?

20:22.949 --> 20:24.884
No.

20:24.917 --> 20:25.952
Oh.

20:25.985 --> 20:27.787
I am so sorry.
Let me just...

20:28.788 --> 20:30.122
Shit. Hold on.

20:30.156 --> 20:33.993
What? I'm in a session.

20:34.026 --> 20:37.596
Okay, stop, stop.
I'll talk to you later.

20:37.630 --> 20:39.031
I am so sorry.

20:40.599 --> 20:42.034
Um...

20:42.068 --> 20:44.871
Okay, so you think
it would be a good idea

20:44.904 --> 20:48.607
to do this boat delivery
with David? Fine.

20:48.641 --> 20:54.446
Fine. Your job/homework
is to not talk too much

20:54.479 --> 20:57.049
and have as much sex
as possible.

20:57.582 --> 20:59.618
Uh...

20:59.652 --> 21:02.889
We can leave it there. We can...
We can leave it there.

21:02.922 --> 21:04.589
Okay, love,
I'm gonna stop you.

21:08.460 --> 21:09.527
This woman...

21:10.730 --> 21:12.031
If you can even imagine it.

21:12.064 --> 21:15.101
This woman, the life
she thought she knew, it's gone.

21:17.637 --> 21:19.005
Everyone thought they were
the perfect couple.

21:19.038 --> 21:20.740
Everyone, including her.

21:20.773 --> 21:23.009
Now, she's been side-swiped.

21:23.042 --> 21:25.543
She's doing everything she can
to keep her shit together

21:25.577 --> 21:26.946
because this woman's...

21:27.512 --> 21:28.613
she's...

21:32.652 --> 21:35.821
she's a hard fucking role.
Right, May?

21:49.534 --> 21:51.871
Even within this one speech,
she goes from a woman

21:51.904 --> 21:56.541
standing in her living room with her
heart in a million bloody pieces,

21:56.574 --> 21:59.145
and by speaking
her truth, she...

21:59.178 --> 22:02.815
by the end, she realizes that,
yes, her heart has been shattered.

22:02.848 --> 22:04.449
But it's...

22:05.318 --> 22:09.789
there's all this
surface area around it.

22:09.822 --> 22:14.526
And even though her breath gets
caught on the jagged corners,

22:15.428 --> 22:19.231
it's actually gotten to be
bigger now.

22:19.265 --> 22:21.599
In pieces, thank you very much.

22:21.634 --> 22:24.602
Yes, she...

22:24.637 --> 22:27.206
she's afraid to leave,
but she's more terrified to sit still.

22:27.239 --> 22:29.541
If she sits still,
she'll go under.

22:30.109 --> 22:31.911
She has to move forward.

22:33.045 --> 22:35.715
Neutral is not good.

22:36.382 --> 22:39.051
Being a victim, it's not good.

22:40.319 --> 22:45.557
She must find
the next right thing.

22:45.590 --> 22:50.062
She must, or the fear and
the hurt will swallow her.

22:50.363 --> 22:51.831
Okay?

22:53.899 --> 22:55.567
Take that in for a second.

22:58.771 --> 23:01.606
Take it in, and let's give it
another go.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.009
All right?

23:03.843 --> 23:05.211
Yeah.

23:05.244 --> 23:07.113
Why don't we go from...

23:08.214 --> 23:10.182
"What could I have
done differently?"

23:23.029 --> 23:24.930
What could I have
done differently?

23:27.366 --> 23:30.136
Was I so fucking naive
to think that we were happy?

23:33.205 --> 23:35.808
You let me think we were happy.

23:39.979 --> 23:41.047
Hello?

23:41.781 --> 23:45.084
Uh, I just...

23:45.117 --> 23:48.120
I told Jennie I probably
wouldn't say anything today,

23:48.154 --> 23:50.089
but I...

23:51.757 --> 23:54.627
I am so grateful
for all of you.

23:55.761 --> 23:58.831
And you, Jennifer Lonergan.

23:58.864 --> 24:02.001
Munroe! Jennie Munroe.

24:02.034 --> 24:04.170
Thank you.

24:04.203 --> 24:05.271
For all this.

24:05.304 --> 24:06.839
But today was...

24:07.640 --> 24:08.941
Today's perfect.

24:10.242 --> 24:11.277
Thank you.

24:12.978 --> 24:15.281
For loving me

24:15.314 --> 24:17.750
in the beautiful way you do.

24:19.418 --> 24:21.921
I want to spend the rest of
my life making you happy.

24:24.156 --> 24:26.258
Supporting you.

24:26.292 --> 24:30.329
I can't believe we get to
do this life thing together.

24:33.833 --> 24:34.900
I love her.

24:38.137 --> 24:39.972
Beautiful, beautiful.

25:04.096 --> 25:07.066
There she is.

25:07.099 --> 25:08.767
You had us scared, sweetheart.

25:08.801 --> 25:10.636
You didn't want to come back.

25:11.737 --> 25:15.040
You're gonna be okay.
We'll take good care of you.

25:15.074 --> 25:19.145
You and your husband
can try again, right away, okay?

25:52.178 --> 25:53.879
Is that her?

25:53.913 --> 25:55.814
- What?
- Is that her?

25:57.283 --> 25:59.018
Yep.

26:03.122 --> 26:04.423
Have you been
speaking to her?

26:04.456 --> 26:06.158
- No.
- You haven't?

26:06.192 --> 26:07.493
No, baby.

26:07.526 --> 26:09.361
It's probably
why she's texting.

26:09.395 --> 26:12.765
She's... It's the weekend.
She knows we're together.

26:12.798 --> 26:14.300
She's trying
to stir shit up.

26:20.105 --> 26:22.308
- What does it say?
- I...

26:26.245 --> 26:27.446
"It isn't fair."

26:29.048 --> 26:30.349
I'll just delete it.

26:33.018 --> 26:34.954
Does she know
that we lost the baby?

26:34.987 --> 26:37.323
I don't know.
I haven't spoken to her since that day.

26:40.793 --> 26:41.860
Just ignore it. Please.

26:41.894 --> 26:43.329
Just... put it on silent.

26:44.830 --> 26:45.965
What are you doing?

26:47.266 --> 26:48.968
Jen, what are you doing?

26:49.001 --> 26:51.470
- Calling her.
- No, don't do that.

26:51.503 --> 26:52.905
Don't do that.

26:53.439 --> 26:55.040
Jen, put that down.

26:55.074 --> 26:56.809
She's crazy. She's just gonna
make shit up.

26:56.842 --> 26:58.477
- Don't do this. Come on.
- This isn't David.

27:01.347 --> 27:03.249
I believe my husband told you
over a month ago

27:03.282 --> 27:04.183
that I knew about you

27:04.216 --> 27:06.852
and that you were
to stop contacting him.

27:06.885 --> 27:09.321
I know you don't respect me,
or clearly yourself,

27:09.355 --> 27:11.190
but I ask that you please
respect the fact

27:11.223 --> 27:13.259
that we have been married
for 15 years.

27:15.294 --> 27:18.797
Do not contact
my husband ever again.

27:35.547 --> 27:37.383
<i>So you're okay
with that, David?</i>

27:38.284 --> 27:39.385
That, what?

27:39.418 --> 27:41.420
Well, that she hijacked
your phone

27:41.453 --> 27:43.255
and bitched that girl out?

27:43.289 --> 27:45.991
Uh, I don't know.

27:51.698 --> 27:53.198
You've lost weight,
haven't you?

27:54.266 --> 27:56.602
Uh, yeah. Probably.

27:56.636 --> 27:59.405
I mean, losing the baby. So...

27:59.438 --> 28:01.106
You absolutely have lost weight.

28:02.341 --> 28:04.209
You don't wanna lose
too much more, because

28:05.010 --> 28:08.547
it's an unfortunate look

28:08.580 --> 28:11.350
for a woman of a certain age.

28:11.917 --> 28:14.053
Hm.

28:14.086 --> 28:18.590
So it sounds like
you two are looking for a counselor

28:18.624 --> 28:22.194
that you both feel comfortable with,
and you're having trouble finding a match.

28:22.227 --> 28:23.295
Is that right?

28:23.797 --> 28:25.331
Who wants to start?

28:29.601 --> 28:35.274
Uh, well, we were just now
on our way here.

28:35.307 --> 28:39.078
We're getting off the subway and we're
heading towards the stairs and this

28:39.111 --> 28:42.548
gorgeous woman just starts...
starts heading towards us.

28:42.581 --> 28:44.016
She's gorgeous from the stairs.

28:44.049 --> 28:47.654
I'm very aware of her. She's...
I've always been able to think that

28:47.687 --> 28:50.122
other women were beautiful
or whatever.

28:50.155 --> 28:51.190
I could see them
for what they were.

28:51.223 --> 28:54.059
They're beautiful,
but they're separate from me.

28:54.093 --> 28:57.563
But now, all of a sudden, every single woman
that I see who is even remotely attractive

28:57.596 --> 28:59.131
is a threat.

28:59.164 --> 29:02.534
Somehow taking away from my beauty
like there's only so much to go around,

29:02.568 --> 29:08.540
like how dare she just hog up all the,
you know, the whatever, the whatever...

29:08.574 --> 29:10.042
And so she's coming at me.

29:10.075 --> 29:14.313
She's coming at me and I could feel
myself getting smaller and angrier

29:14.346 --> 29:17.049
the closer she gets. And as she passes
with her perfect little long legs,

29:17.082 --> 29:20.386
just passes by, as she does,
I say to myself,

29:20.419 --> 29:23.055
"Please see my beauty, David,

29:23.088 --> 29:25.658
"please don't let her suck up
all of my beauty."

29:25.692 --> 29:28.160
And as she passes,

29:28.193 --> 29:30.429
he turns his head.

29:30.462 --> 29:33.399
He just turns his head, like,
to look at her. He just goes...

29:35.534 --> 29:37.202
like a fucking animal.
He just...

29:37.236 --> 29:39.371
I mean, who is this guy?

29:39.405 --> 29:43.609
The guy that I've been beautiful to for 15
years is now suddenly overnight bored of me

29:43.643 --> 29:45.477
and he can't help it.

29:45.511 --> 29:47.346
I mean, who is that guy?

29:47.379 --> 29:50.549
He gets one taste of other,
and now he's like a fucking animal.

29:50.582 --> 29:54.453
It's like that fish... like that...
with the... with the...

29:54.486 --> 29:56.455
or like a pit bull.

29:56.488 --> 29:58.123
Like a fucking
sweet little perfect pit bull

29:58.157 --> 30:00.092
who has been nothing but loving
its entire life,

30:00.125 --> 30:02.027
and it accidentally gets a
little bit of blood in its mouth,

30:02.060 --> 30:04.263
and it just starts fucking
attacking women,

30:04.296 --> 30:07.199
and postmen or whatever
the fuck walks by the house.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.302
Yes...

30:10.335 --> 30:12.672
I get it. I get it now.

30:12.705 --> 30:16.743
I'm a subscriber to most of the
important off-Broadway theaters.

30:16.776 --> 30:19.578
And I saw you
in the Pettibone play.

30:19.611 --> 30:22.214
You are amazing.

30:22.247 --> 30:29.288
The way you climbed up that wall,
the play was "meh" but you were fantastic.

30:29.321 --> 30:31.023
God, I feel bad.
I should have said something,

30:31.056 --> 30:32.157
but I thought
I recognized your name,

30:32.191 --> 30:34.426
and I had some time today,
so I made the appointment.

30:34.460 --> 30:38.731
But I'm getting ready to go to
London on my annual theater crawl.

30:38.765 --> 30:43.435
I can definitely be
your therapist when I come back.

30:43.469 --> 30:46.405
Depends on how much
urgent care... both of you,

30:46.438 --> 30:49.041
it depends on how much
urgent care you think you need.

31:20.339 --> 31:21.473
Hey, guys.

31:21.507 --> 31:22.675
- Hey.
- Hi, how're you doing?

31:32.719 --> 31:36.622
Oh, you know, actually,
I have a feeling that you're over there.

31:36.656 --> 31:39.659
This is for a kiddie drink.
This is like for moms.

31:39.692 --> 31:42.461
Unless, I think... I think
you might be over there?

31:42.494 --> 31:43.763
- Oh.
- Yeah.

31:44.429 --> 31:45.497
Thank you.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.202
Oh, that was so cute.

31:50.235 --> 31:53.071
She thought we were all
going after the same thing.

31:53.105 --> 31:55.574
What do you think the breakdown
for that spot is?

31:56.575 --> 31:57.777
Uh... Provocative jewels?

31:57.810 --> 31:59.712
Second wife proposal?

31:59.746 --> 32:03.081
"Female twenties. Drop dead gorgeous.
English not necessary."

32:03.115 --> 32:04.616
- We don't need to hear her speak.
- No.

32:04.651 --> 32:07.854
"Male, handsome, but relatable. Late forties to early nineties."

32:12.357 --> 32:13.425
May I?

32:13.458 --> 32:14.526
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

32:16.696 --> 32:18.564
- Thank you.
- Sure.

32:23.168 --> 32:24.236
- You want your book?
- Yeah.

32:24.269 --> 32:25.772
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

32:27.472 --> 32:29.608
Excuse me.

32:29.642 --> 32:32.110
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I think you're...

32:32.144 --> 32:33.078
What?

32:33.111 --> 32:36.315
I was just saying
I think you're over there.

32:36.348 --> 32:39.217
I have half a bagel in here if
you want to take that edge off.

32:52.832 --> 32:56.602
Oh, no, sweetie. I think you're over there.
This is for a kids drink.

32:56.636 --> 32:59.338
Oh, this is all so confusing.

32:59.371 --> 33:02.240
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Yes, it is. You're welcome.

33:03.743 --> 33:07.546
- Okay. Marcie, are you ready?
- Yep.

33:07.579 --> 33:08.781
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:08.815 --> 33:11.149
- And Jennie?
- Yes.

33:11.183 --> 33:12.852
Are you sure you're here for me?

33:12.885 --> 33:14.519
I think so. 3:40.

33:14.553 --> 33:16.254
I don't see you here.

33:16.555 --> 33:17.724
Oh, um...

33:17.757 --> 33:20.425
Oh, yeah.
You're over there, hon.

33:20.459 --> 33:22.427
Okay. Just assumed.

33:36.375 --> 33:37.910
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

33:39.211 --> 33:40.680
Yeah, I can see you.
Can you see me?

33:45.785 --> 33:46.853
I don't.

33:48.587 --> 33:49.656
No.

33:51.758 --> 33:54.794
I don't... I don't miss... Three months
is nothing. I'm not gonna miss you at all.

33:56.595 --> 33:57.697
No.

33:58.597 --> 33:59.666
I won't.

34:01.266 --> 34:02.534
Okay.

34:03.836 --> 34:05.237
I love you, too.

34:06.673 --> 34:07.774
Okay.

34:08.941 --> 34:10.208
Okay.

34:10.542 --> 34:11.576
Bye, baby.

34:12.310 --> 34:13.311
Be safe.

34:14.479 --> 34:16.548
Okay. Okay.

34:26.659 --> 34:29.361
What is your favorite memory
of us?

34:31.831 --> 34:33.565
What?

34:33.598 --> 34:35.333
<i>What is... I was...</i>

34:35.367 --> 34:39.271
<i>just remembering when you...
when you turned the boat around</i>

34:39.304 --> 34:41.974
<i>and you didn't want to go south because you
didn't want to be away from me for that long.</i>

34:42.008 --> 34:43.341
- <i>Do you remember that?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

34:44.911 --> 34:45.912
<i>I think...</i>

34:46.578 --> 34:48.715
<i>Maybe we should focus on...</i>

34:48.748 --> 34:51.383
<i>On those memories,
the good ones when we were happy...</i>

34:51.416 --> 34:53.285
I turned back on that trip...

34:53.318 --> 34:54.921
back to you...

34:54.954 --> 34:57.456
because I knew if I kept going,
I wouldn't come back.

35:20.880 --> 35:22.514
You need to move out...

35:27.419 --> 35:28.921
Today. You need to move out.

36:22.909 --> 36:24.777
- Munroe?
- Yes.

36:24.811 --> 36:27.579
Why don't you have a seat?
Nathan will be with you.

36:46.833 --> 36:48.466
That's smart.

36:48.500 --> 36:53.505
The little area to distract the kids while
Mom and Dad decide who gets the house.

36:56.142 --> 36:58.443
Munroe, right?

36:58.476 --> 37:00.112
Yes.

37:00.146 --> 37:03.381
That would be funny
if you weren't.

37:03.415 --> 37:05.417
Like if you came out here
to make out a will,

37:05.450 --> 37:07.753
and I handed you
separation papers.

37:07.787 --> 37:12.758
And then you'd be like, "Whoa, whoa,
honey, honey, what the f is going on here?"

37:14.660 --> 37:17.429
So, um, I told Jennie this
over the phone

37:17.462 --> 37:20.733
when we made the appointment,
I should let you know as well.

37:20.766 --> 37:23.069
Um,
we are not attorneys.

37:23.102 --> 37:26.105
We cannot give you legal advice.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.943
Um... Legal... So... Advice.

37:30.977 --> 37:36.883
What we can provide you with is self-help
legal document preparation services

37:36.916 --> 37:39.451
at your specific direction.

37:39.785 --> 37:41.120
Okay?

37:42.822 --> 37:46.859
Great. So Jennie told me just
a few things over the phone.

37:46.893 --> 37:48.828
Just need to confirm 'em
real quick.

37:48.861 --> 37:51.529
Um... So, no kids, correct?

37:51.563 --> 37:52.965
- No.
- Yes.

37:52.999 --> 37:54.901
- Yes.
- Yes. No kids.

37:54.934 --> 37:56.869
Okay. And no property?

38:00.907 --> 38:02.174
Okay, well...

38:03.809 --> 38:05.745
that makes our lives
a lot easier.

38:05.778 --> 38:09.215
Paperwork wise.

38:09.248 --> 38:11.616
I'm gonna need you guys
to just read everything in here

38:11.651 --> 38:15.620
and add any and all bank
accounts, including car payments,

38:15.655 --> 38:17.455
- student loans, the whole...
- The boat.

38:22.161 --> 38:23.495
Boat.

38:24.797 --> 38:26.232
The "boat"?

38:26.265 --> 38:28.868
Dead serious. You have a boat?

38:28.901 --> 38:32.104
Toot-toot, my man. You got to
take me out there, bro.

38:36.142 --> 38:37.609
Got to.

38:37.643 --> 38:38.744
- <i>Hey, doll.</i>
- <i>Hi.</i>

38:38.778 --> 38:40.846
- Sign in for me.
- Okay.

38:41.948 --> 38:43.149
How have you been?

38:44.016 --> 38:47.519
I... I've been good. Good.

38:49.889 --> 38:51.489
- You have the same insurance?
- Yeah.

38:51.523 --> 38:52.624
Okay.

38:57.763 --> 39:01.667
Your teeth... beautiful. Okay.

39:02.735 --> 39:03.836
Rinse.

39:06.538 --> 39:07.572
So...

39:08.741 --> 39:12.211
how is that dreamy, lumberjack
looking husband of yours?

39:12.845 --> 39:13.913
Spit.

39:15.547 --> 39:16.649
Those eyes.

39:18.184 --> 39:19.218
You have children, no?

39:19.819 --> 39:20.886
No.

39:21.320 --> 39:22.788
No?

39:22.822 --> 39:24.924
His eyes, your teeth...

39:24.957 --> 39:26.491
- beautiful.
- Ah.

39:26.993 --> 39:29.095
Yeah, well, we're...

39:29.128 --> 39:30.830
Hey, ahoy there,
first mate!

39:30.863 --> 39:32.164
Oh, hi.

39:32.198 --> 39:35.134
So how's the captain doing?
You two going to Florida this year?

39:35.167 --> 39:37.269
Uh... No...

39:37.303 --> 39:39.537
Actually, we're separated.

39:40.940 --> 39:42.641
- Well, that's too bad.
- Yeah.

39:43.608 --> 39:44.810
Too bad, Doctor.

39:44.844 --> 39:47.747
Well, shit. I don't know what
to say. I really don't know.

39:47.780 --> 39:48.881
That's okay.

39:48.914 --> 39:51.583
Okay, you guys have kids?

39:51.616 --> 39:53.618
- No.
- Makes it easier.

39:53.652 --> 39:54.754
Oh, I don't know.

39:54.787 --> 39:57.589
What do you mean, Olga?
What are you talking about?

39:57.622 --> 40:00.760
- Too bad no kids.
- But she'll be okay, Olga. She'll be okay.

40:00.793 --> 40:02.061
- Well, she may be okay.
- It's all right. You go on.

40:02.094 --> 40:04.296
But the unborn children.
What about them?

40:04.330 --> 40:05.664
You go on.

40:06.598 --> 40:09.168
And you, um...

40:09.201 --> 40:11.771
- You'll be sure to rinse real good. Okay?
- Okay.

40:11.804 --> 40:12.872
Yeah.

40:15.174 --> 40:18.210
There's nothing you can do to
patch it up a little bit, maybe?

40:18.244 --> 40:19.845
Mm-mm.

40:27.853 --> 40:28.888
Am I done?

40:28.921 --> 40:30.890
- Yeah, yeah, is finished.
- Okay.

40:32.358 --> 40:34.226
Did he cheat?

40:34.260 --> 40:35.995
- Sorry.
- It happened to me.

40:37.163 --> 40:40.266
I come home from work one day,

40:40.299 --> 40:43.302
and there's a 350-pound woman

40:43.335 --> 40:47.173
in a negligee cooking
a pot roast in my kitchen.

40:47.206 --> 40:48.240
I shit you not.

40:49.075 --> 40:51.777
She said, "Who are you?"

40:51.811 --> 40:55.081
I said, "Who am I?
This is my apartment.

40:55.114 --> 40:58.651
"My fucking stretched to shit
negligee..." Excuse my French.

40:58.684 --> 41:02.254
"And a pot roast I've been saving
for my nephew's confirmation.

41:02.288 --> 41:05.291
"Who am I?"

41:05.324 --> 41:08.828
I walked out of there in a daze
like someone punched me in the face.

41:09.195 --> 41:10.796
Okay.

41:10.830 --> 41:14.166
I know. I know, I know. I ended up kicking
him out after ten years of marriage.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.871
350 pounds, Jennie,
I shit you not.

41:19.738 --> 41:21.807
That's when I stopped
wearing Spanx.

41:23.375 --> 41:25.277
You're gonna be okay.

41:25.911 --> 41:27.612
Here. Mm-hm.

41:28.747 --> 41:30.149
And you look very thin.

41:31.050 --> 41:34.153
- So that's good.
- Trauma trim.

41:34.186 --> 41:36.655
- That's what they call it.
- Yeah.

41:36.689 --> 41:37.790
- And I'm out!
- All right.

41:37.823 --> 41:41.093
C'mon. Look at this bountiful haul.

41:41.127 --> 41:42.995
- Yeah, I brought a lot of stuff.
- Yeah.

41:43.028 --> 41:45.197
- Okay.
- And all of it, it's kinda...

41:45.231 --> 41:50.236
it's sort of pre-divorce stuff.
So, um... anyway...

41:50.269 --> 41:55.174
It's very good quality, but it's
a little too "classy lady". Right?

41:55.207 --> 41:56.942
- No, it's cute.
- And, uh...

41:56.976 --> 42:00.312
As you can see, I'm kind of
a little bit of a good time gal.

42:00.346 --> 42:02.448
- Yeah.
- That's hot.

42:02.481 --> 42:05.284
Good time gal. Good time... Yes!

42:05.317 --> 42:08.020
- Easy, cheesy. It's okay.
- It's beautiful.

42:08.053 --> 42:10.890
- It actually goes with this dress.
- Oh, no, I saw it.

42:10.923 --> 42:12.191
I brought a lot of stuff.

42:12.224 --> 42:17.229
Everybody just go on, take it all.
I don't want any of it.

42:17.263 --> 42:19.832
Just everyone sorta pick a first
and second choice, I guess,

42:19.865 --> 42:22.735
and then if we have an overlap,
we'll fight it out.

42:22.768 --> 42:27.039
We'll figure that out. And also in
terms of artwork and stuff, the pillows,

42:27.072 --> 42:28.741
the little...
that kind of stuff.

42:28.774 --> 42:32.811
Basically, anything with a
sailboat nautical motif is out.

42:32.845 --> 42:34.813
So, go nuts.

42:34.847 --> 42:36.749
- Okay.
- I think I've got it.

43:01.173 --> 43:02.841
Is this real, too?

43:02.875 --> 43:04.443
- No.
- Isn't that great?

43:04.476 --> 43:08.847
- Lot of stuff.
- And I also have these...

43:10.349 --> 43:12.084
If anyone knows anyone.

43:17.156 --> 43:21.994
Erin, say something, please.
I can always count on you to...

43:22.027 --> 43:26.332
A bucket of duckling farts?
I don't know.

43:27.800 --> 43:29.401
- You okay?
- Yeah.

43:29.435 --> 43:31.337
Wanna talk about it?

43:31.370 --> 43:33.872
- Don't wanna talk about it?
- I'm not sure.

43:33.906 --> 43:37.209
I think... I'm just... This is...
This was... This has been good.

43:37.243 --> 43:39.378
- Thank you for having us over.
- Yeah.

43:39.411 --> 43:41.814
Oh, God. We have a man down.

43:41.847 --> 43:43.415
We have a man down
in a part of D.C.

43:43.449 --> 43:46.318
Oh, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You're just so...

43:46.352 --> 43:48.854
- You're admirable.
- Well, I don't know about that.

43:48.887 --> 43:50.389
You are.

43:50.422 --> 43:55.160
Oh, I was a wreck. I couldn't get out
of bed for, what was it? Three years.

43:55.194 --> 43:59.198
Yeah, I had a...
We had a heinous relationship. He was a...

43:59.231 --> 44:00.099
- He was an a-hole.
- Mm-hm.

44:00.132 --> 44:02.301
- He was a heinous a-hole.
- Yes, he was.

44:02.334 --> 44:05.971
- He was a hein-hole.
- He was... He was a hein-hole.

44:09.008 --> 44:11.844
You guys are lucky,
I think, personally.

44:11.877 --> 44:13.879
What? You're still young.

44:13.912 --> 44:17.182
My Uncle Pete, he just left my
aunt after 55 years of marriage.

44:17.216 --> 44:19.918
- You're fucking kidding me!
- No, 55 years.

44:19.952 --> 44:22.221
He's what, like a few birthdays away
from needing her to wipe his ass

44:22.254 --> 44:23.489
and he leaves her now.

44:23.522 --> 44:25.824
- Hein-hole.
- Hein-hole.

44:25.858 --> 44:28.127
- Big, huge, hein-hole.
- Huge.

44:28.160 --> 44:30.396
When did you take your ring off?

44:30.429 --> 44:34.566
Well, one night, I was actually headed out
with friends and just as I was about to leave,

44:34.600 --> 44:41.940
there was this cheesy song from like the
'60s or the '70s about wedding rings.

44:41.974 --> 44:48.981
And the song comes on. And I just was
like, "Okay," you know, and I took it off,

44:49.014 --> 44:52.151
put it in the top drawer of my
dresser, and then that was that.

44:52.184 --> 44:57.189
I mean, there was no tears.
It was just like, "Hm".

44:57.222 --> 44:59.992
I just... I can't take mine off
yet for some reason, I don't...

45:02.261 --> 45:08.300
Don't rush it. You'll know. I've got an
amazing therapist if you need one, he's...

45:08.334 --> 45:11.570
- amazing.
- Well, I might... actually, I'm seeing a new one next week,

45:11.603 --> 45:14.907
- so fingers crossed.
- Yeah.

45:14.940 --> 45:17.409
Kathryn, what the fuck?

45:17.443 --> 45:19.111
Wine.
Give her some wine.

45:19.144 --> 45:23.248
No, I can't have any wine.
I'm pregnant.

45:23.282 --> 45:25.384
James and I are having a baby.

45:25.417 --> 45:27.519
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

45:27.553 --> 45:32.124
- That makes so much sense. You're going batshit crazy.
- That's amazing.

45:32.157 --> 45:35.494
Oh, my God,
you're having a baby.

45:35.527 --> 45:41.634
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That's so great. Come here. Kathryn.

45:41.668 --> 45:45.170
Oh, my gosh.
I'm so happy for you.

46:05.991 --> 46:07.192
Babe?

46:20.272 --> 46:24.143
What about the baby?
You lost the pregnancy, correct?

46:24.176 --> 46:27.179
- Yes.
- Sorry.

46:27.212 --> 46:29.381
How are you feeling about that?

46:31.583 --> 46:34.019
I feel like she's out there

46:34.486 --> 46:36.555
and she's mine.

46:36.588 --> 46:40.325
But it's... I think that's one of
the things that's been hard about

46:40.359 --> 46:45.665
letting go is that it's... not just a loss.
It's like I know she's out there,

46:45.698 --> 46:47.266
but she's not with me.

46:47.299 --> 46:49.334
- Is that...
- Totally, totally.

46:49.368 --> 46:54.006
It's like, my heart hasn't been
updated to the fact that she's not here

46:54.039 --> 46:58.444
and then if she's not here, then why
do I feel like I have to find her?

46:58.477 --> 47:00.479
Do you know
that the baby was a girl?

47:00.512 --> 47:04.717
- No. They asked me if I wanted to know. But...
- Of course, of course.

47:04.751 --> 47:07.453
Well, I wouldn't judge
this feeling that you're having.

47:07.486 --> 47:09.656
It could mean many things.

47:09.689 --> 47:14.560
Is it possible that you feel like you're
looking for a version of your younger self?

47:14.593 --> 47:17.429
- Your inner child?
- Yeah, that's...

47:17.463 --> 47:19.531
Yeah, that's interesting.
I haven't thought about it that way.

47:19.565 --> 47:23.068
Is it possible that because
you have an aching in your heart

47:23.101 --> 47:25.638
for a child
that you're seeking her out?

47:25.672 --> 47:28.140
I mean, we see
what we want to see

47:28.173 --> 47:34.413
or need to see to justify what our
heart has already decided it wants.

47:34.446 --> 47:36.381
Yeah. Yeah, that's...

47:37.316 --> 47:39.351
Or is it possible...

47:41.353 --> 47:45.524
that your lost embryo spirit

47:45.557 --> 47:49.294
is circling the planet
for a hundred years,

47:49.328 --> 47:53.332
sending waves of
emotional correspondence,

47:54.701 --> 47:58.270
searching for the perfect
celestial match.

48:02.441 --> 48:06.746
- Um...
- I know, I know.

48:25.330 --> 48:29.268
It's intense when you find
the person who will heal you,

48:30.469 --> 48:32.739
and release you
of all of your pain.

48:37.376 --> 48:39.444
We should hear back
in 7 to 10 business days,

48:39.478 --> 48:43.181
- but if you have any questions, feel free to give us a call.
- Thank you.

48:49.521 --> 48:51.223
Hi.

48:51.256 --> 48:54.059
Today has been...

48:54.827 --> 48:57.229
- Give me a second.
- Yeah.

49:01.533 --> 49:05.070
Here we go. Mm-hm.

49:08.507 --> 49:10.810
"Plaintiff against defendant."

49:12.712 --> 49:14.479
Wow, okay.

49:17.784 --> 49:21.553
There is no way we are letting you
go through this alone, gorgeous.

49:21.587 --> 49:24.456
I whipped up a kick ass
divorce mix playlist for you.

49:24.489 --> 49:28.493
- And I was in charge of the booze.
- That's right.

49:53.418 --> 49:57.489
- It's always the man's fault. Always.
- Mm-hm.

49:57.522 --> 49:59.892
You must see a lot of shit.

49:59.926 --> 50:04.363
Oh, my God, I do. Hm.
But here's the thing...

50:05.632 --> 50:10.369
you, Jennie, you, right?

50:10.402 --> 50:14.841
I don't know you,
but you ooze life, mama.

50:14.874 --> 50:20.212
Yes, you are beautiful.
You're a beautiful soul.

50:21.213 --> 50:23.750
You are... You are beautiful.

50:23.783 --> 50:30.255
You are gonna have men
eating out your ass.

50:30.288 --> 50:34.559
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.

50:35.728 --> 50:38.563
Hey, hand.
Maybe eating out of her hand?

50:42.501 --> 50:45.237
Jennie! Jennie!

50:45.838 --> 50:49.541
Yeah! Oh, yeah.

50:49.574 --> 50:51.811
This...

50:51.844 --> 50:58.550
This was... The best...
The best divorce I've ever been a part of.

50:58.583 --> 51:01.754
- Yeah!
- Yes.

51:20.372 --> 51:23.375
- Wow!
- Yeah...

51:23.408 --> 51:28.246
Yeah. Forgive me. I think you're the
fifth or sixth therapist that I've seen.

51:28.280 --> 51:31.951
So, I've told this, like, a million times.
That's... Which is probably good.

51:31.984 --> 51:36.723
There's at least some distance
now, which is just good.

51:36.756 --> 51:38.825
I could breathe
a little bit now.

51:38.858 --> 51:43.763
- Well, that's good. Breathing is good.
- Yeah. Yeah.

51:43.796 --> 51:45.965
Marissa said that you were
great, but she also said that

51:45.998 --> 51:49.802
it took her three years to get out of bed.
So I was like "Well, how great can he be?"

51:49.836 --> 51:53.338
Well, in my defense, I didn't meet
Marissa until the day she got out of bed.

51:53.371 --> 51:54.741
Oh, then shit.

51:54.774 --> 51:56.809
- You're good.
- Thank you.

51:57.910 --> 52:01.446
- So you really saw five or six therapists?
- Yeah.

52:01.480 --> 52:04.449
My husband used to be an actor.
I know, it's absolutely brutal.

52:04.483 --> 52:06.652
Did you go in for therapy
for yourself before that

52:06.686 --> 52:09.055
- or it was only couples therapy?
- Well, that was it.

52:09.088 --> 52:13.893
Yeah, couples. But I... I think I want
that. I know, I want that for myself.

52:13.926 --> 52:16.294
Now, I want that.

52:16.328 --> 52:21.634
Good. Well, I hope there will
be room for me in your growth.

52:21.667 --> 52:26.072
And, I hope that this will always be a place
where you can feel free to be yourself

52:26.105 --> 52:32.779
and take care of yourself and ultimately feel
a little less burdened and a little lighter.

52:33.980 --> 52:36.381
Thank you.

52:36.414 --> 52:40.653
If there's one thing that you could hear
me say to you now, before you leave,

52:40.686 --> 52:41.854
what would it be?

52:44.456 --> 52:48.593
Um. Well, what you just said
was pretty great.

52:48.627 --> 52:52.999
I must say, um, uh, I guess...

52:55.101 --> 52:58.037
just that I'll...

52:58.070 --> 53:04.911
that I'll be okay. That I'll be able to
someday just look back on all this and...

53:04.944 --> 53:07.445
and just... I'll be okay.

53:09.481 --> 53:12.051
I promise you, you will be okay.

53:14.921 --> 53:16.354
Thank you.

53:28.801 --> 53:30.703
You could sit anywhere, hon.

53:42.882 --> 53:45.985
- Hey, sunshine.
- Thank you.

53:46.018 --> 53:49.421
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yes, please.

53:49.454 --> 53:51.824
You guys, you have
the sausage patties, right?

53:51.858 --> 53:53.525
I could do the patties.
Not the links.

53:53.558 --> 53:56.896
Oh, good, good, good. That's what I thought.
Nobody has patties anymore. It's weird.

53:56.929 --> 54:01.801
- I'll do the two eggs scrambled. Sausage patties.
- Mm-hm.

54:01.834 --> 54:08.040
- And instead of the home fries, can I have French fries?
- Let me see. It's kinda early.

54:08.074 --> 54:10.743
Hey, Marcella,
can we do French fries?

54:10.776 --> 54:14.146
For that one? Yeah. I'll get right on it.

54:14.180 --> 54:16.581
- Sucker for pretty girls, that one.
- Thank you.

54:16.615 --> 54:18.885
- White, wheat, rye or bagel?
- Rye, please.

54:18.918 --> 54:22.822
Okay. Excellent. I will be right
back with your order, love.

54:24.090 --> 54:27.459
You. Stop messing
with my customers.

55:09.669 --> 55:12.504
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

55:12.537 --> 55:14.140
Are you okay?

55:14.173 --> 55:16.676
Oh. Uh, yeah.

55:18.210 --> 55:21.147
Actually, I just took
my wedding ring off.

55:23.581 --> 55:25.685
Mm-hmm.

55:25.718 --> 55:27.720
What are you
even doing over there?

55:27.753 --> 55:29.889
Can you get back to work,
back to the fryer?

55:29.922 --> 55:32.124
- Back to the...
- Oh, my God.

55:32.959 --> 55:34.226
Trouble with this one.

55:35.728 --> 55:38.563
- <i>You gotta put yourself out there.</i>
- <i>No, I don't.</i>

55:38.596 --> 55:40.866
The first few are gonna
be miserable. They just are.

55:40.900 --> 55:43.202
But you don't wanna wait
until you meet your dream man

55:43.235 --> 55:44.569
to go on your first date.

55:44.602 --> 55:46.739
No, you gotta work out
the kinks.

55:46.772 --> 55:47.873
- I...
- Here's a little tip.

55:47.907 --> 55:50.608
A little challenge, if you will,
and it totally works.

55:50.643 --> 55:52.678
It's called 333.

55:52.712 --> 55:54.914
So you walk into a party
or a bar, what have you,

55:54.947 --> 55:57.650
and you just casually scan
the room, scope it out.

55:57.683 --> 55:59.819
And if you see somebody
who you like, looks up,

55:59.852 --> 56:01.553
you think they're cute.

56:01.586 --> 56:03.990
You look at them
and you lock eyes with them

56:04.023 --> 56:07.259
for three seconds,
and then you hold it.

56:07.293 --> 56:09.662
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi,

56:09.695 --> 56:11.964
three Mississippis,
and then you look away.

56:11.998 --> 56:14.834
You made it totally apparent that
you were attracted to them, right?

56:14.867 --> 56:16.802
Oh, no! Maybe not.

56:16.836 --> 56:19.537
So you have to do this quick
little glance back, like this...

56:20.605 --> 56:22.540
But you gotta be subtle
with that glance back.

56:22.574 --> 56:23.676
Listen to me,

56:23.709 --> 56:25.978
because if you hold it
for, like, three entire seconds,

56:26.012 --> 56:27.179
it's just gonna be creepy.

56:27.213 --> 56:29.148
So it just wants to be
like a little,

56:29.181 --> 56:31.851
"Yep, mister, that's exactly
what you think it is, hmm,"

56:31.884 --> 56:33.585
and then you're out. That's it.

56:33.618 --> 56:36.188
Yes, it's just like
an invitation

56:36.222 --> 56:37.990
for the guy to come up
and talk to you.

56:38.024 --> 56:39.792
But you have
to do the glance back

56:39.825 --> 56:41.160
because that's the invitation.

56:41.193 --> 56:43.029
- No, that's awful.
- Yes, I'm telling you,

56:43.062 --> 56:45.097
it totally works
for my gay dude friends.

56:45.131 --> 56:46.598
It totally works.

56:46.632 --> 56:47.733
I haven't tried it yet,
of course.

56:47.767 --> 56:48.834
- I'm too chicken.
- Erin...

56:48.868 --> 56:49.902
- I am!
- Don't tell me to do something

56:49.935 --> 56:52.071
- that you can't do.
- Yes, I can. I totally can.

56:52.104 --> 56:54.173
Besides, I don't need no 333.

56:54.206 --> 56:57.176
I already got my signature
go-to moves at a party.

56:57.209 --> 56:58.711
I like to be that girl

56:58.744 --> 57:01.013
with her arms crossed
in front of her chest

57:01.047 --> 57:03.649
and her back facing
every attractive,

57:03.682 --> 57:05.985
available heterosexual man

57:06.018 --> 57:08.988
just daring them
to break through this caustic,

57:09.021 --> 57:11.623
- go-fuck-yourself exterior.
- You're not like that.

57:13.092 --> 57:15.728
But my true, true soulmate
will see through all this

57:15.761 --> 57:19.231
and say, "See that mean girl
over there ignoring me?

57:19.265 --> 57:22.001
"There's something about her.
I can't get enough of her.

57:22.034 --> 57:25.004
"Oh, yes, we shall be married
in the spring."

57:26.672 --> 57:28.007
What's the other three?

57:28.040 --> 57:29.075
"The other three" what?

57:29.108 --> 57:30.142
You said 333.

57:30.176 --> 57:32.044
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You have to do it

57:32.078 --> 57:33.879
three times a day to practice.

57:33.913 --> 57:35.081
- No.
- Let's try it now.

57:35.114 --> 57:36.082
- No, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.

57:36.115 --> 57:37.783
I still have a dent
where my ring used to be.

57:37.817 --> 57:39.085
Girl, we're gonna do it
with this guy right now.

57:39.118 --> 57:40.786
- Right, you do it.
- We'll go it together. Ready?

57:40.820 --> 57:42.620
One Mississippi.
Two Mississippi.

57:42.655 --> 57:43.489
Three Mississippi.

57:43.522 --> 57:45.991
Okay, it's time
for the glance back.

57:46.025 --> 57:47.059
We'll do it together.

57:47.093 --> 57:48.626
If this goes according to plan,

57:48.661 --> 57:51.097
he should be standing
stock still, waiting for us.

57:51.130 --> 57:53.799
Ready? One, two, three.
Glance back.

57:58.204 --> 58:00.406
Oh, okay.

58:00.439 --> 58:02.007
So he's not buying
what we're selling,

58:02.041 --> 58:02.875
but that's okay.

58:02.908 --> 58:04.410
- Doesn't matter.
- The dog glanced back.

58:04.443 --> 58:06.078
The dog did something.

58:13.819 --> 58:15.855
<i>Jennie, uh,
check your email.</i>

58:15.888 --> 58:19.758
<i>You have an appointment Friday
for a new play.</i>

58:19.792 --> 58:21.127
<i>It's called</i>
To Have and to Hold.

58:21.160 --> 58:23.028
<i>British import,
won a whole bunch of shit.</i>

58:23.062 --> 58:26.031
<i>Nigel Hopkins is directing.</i>

58:26.065 --> 58:28.167
<i>I think you're really
gonna love this play.</i>

58:28.200 --> 58:31.036
<i>Uh, it seems like
a really great fit for you.</i>

58:31.070 --> 58:33.339
<i>So call me
if you have questions.</i>

58:33.372 --> 58:36.142
<i>I am... I'm around. Okay, bye.</i>

59:47.146 --> 59:48.180
- Hey.
- Hey.

59:48.214 --> 59:49.448
Welcome to the Pleasure Chest.

59:49.481 --> 59:52.151
- Let me know if there's anything I can get you.
- Thank you.

1:00:00.993 --> 1:00:02.027
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:00:02.061 --> 1:00:04.863
This whole area is my specialty.

1:00:04.897 --> 1:00:05.931
Oh, okay.

1:00:05.965 --> 1:00:07.766
- Questions?
- Um...

1:00:07.800 --> 1:00:10.135
Actually, yes. Yes, I do, um...

1:00:10.169 --> 1:00:12.504
The girls are having
a bachelorette party,

1:00:12.538 --> 1:00:13.839
and I was...

1:00:13.872 --> 1:00:17.176
They nominated me
to pick up the, um...

1:00:17.209 --> 1:00:18.310
It's for you. It's okay.

1:00:18.344 --> 1:00:21.347
No, it's... It's for a friend
who's getting married.

1:00:21.380 --> 1:00:23.148
- Ah-ha!
- And they...

1:00:23.182 --> 1:00:25.384
They picked me
to be the one to...

1:00:25.417 --> 1:00:27.253
I though it'd be more obvious.
I can't remember the name of it.

1:00:27.286 --> 1:00:29.488
- I think, it's, uh...
- Uh...

1:00:29.521 --> 1:00:30.456
- Uh...
- What?

1:00:30.489 --> 1:00:33.859
Um,
it's part of a collection...

1:00:33.892 --> 1:00:34.893
Symphony collection?

1:00:35.461 --> 1:00:36.495
Maybe.

1:00:36.528 --> 1:00:39.098
Okay, the...

1:00:43.502 --> 1:00:44.970
Saxophone.

1:00:45.504 --> 1:00:48.207
The... ah!

1:00:51.243 --> 1:00:53.045
Piccolo or...

1:00:54.013 --> 1:00:55.014
The...

1:00:57.916 --> 1:00:59.218
Maestro.

1:01:00.853 --> 1:01:01.920
- No.
- No?

1:01:01.954 --> 1:01:04.023
- Nope.
- None of these. Okay.

1:01:04.823 --> 1:01:07.192
Poker collection.

1:01:07.860 --> 1:01:10.262
The, ah...

1:01:10.996 --> 1:01:14.366
Inside Straight.

1:01:15.034 --> 1:01:16.902
The...

1:01:17.903 --> 1:01:20.939
Royal Flush.

1:01:21.940 --> 1:01:24.143
The, ah...

1:01:25.978 --> 1:01:27.413
All In.

1:01:29.381 --> 1:01:31.350
Yeah, that's, um...

1:01:31.383 --> 1:01:33.285
That's a lot.
That's, um...

1:01:33.319 --> 1:01:35.020
Too much?

1:01:35.054 --> 1:01:37.589
- Just not so aggressive.
- Non-aggressive?

1:01:37.623 --> 1:01:38.824
Yeah.

1:01:40.426 --> 1:01:41.593
The Bumble Bug.

1:01:41.627 --> 1:01:42.961
- Oh, see?
- Bumble Bug.

1:01:42.995 --> 1:01:44.129
- Yes, that's, uh...
- Yeah.

1:01:44.163 --> 1:01:46.131
- Yeah, you're gonna love...
- Sort of...

1:01:46.165 --> 1:01:47.933
- ...the bug.
- Oh, it's not for me.

1:01:49.034 --> 1:01:50.202
Anything else?

1:01:50.235 --> 1:01:52.571
You want a penis candy bar

1:01:52.604 --> 1:01:55.374
for your bachelorette party
of one?

1:01:55.407 --> 1:01:56.475
No, thank you.

1:01:56.508 --> 1:01:58.645
You know, you can connect this
to your smartphone.

1:01:58.678 --> 1:01:59.945
Oh, God, I don't need...

1:01:59.978 --> 1:02:01.413
No, no, no, it's good.
It's an app.

1:02:01.447 --> 1:02:03.115
Yeah, I don't need an app.

1:02:03.148 --> 1:02:04.216
You're gonna love this thing.

1:02:04.249 --> 1:02:05.918
I don't leave the house
without it.

1:02:05.951 --> 1:02:06.919
Exactly.

1:02:06.952 --> 1:02:09.121
Yeah, one time I had
this flight to Amsterdam.

1:02:09.154 --> 1:02:11.256
It was with my parents,
and this thing saved me.

1:02:11.290 --> 1:02:12.458
So you just multitasked?

1:02:12.491 --> 1:02:13.625
- Yeah.
- We could be...

1:02:15.160 --> 1:02:16.663
We could be vacuuming and shit.

1:02:19.164 --> 1:02:21.100
My, uh...
My friend might be back

1:02:21.133 --> 1:02:22.935
for the, uh, for the All In.

1:02:22.968 --> 1:02:24.403
- Good!
- When she's ready.

1:02:24.436 --> 1:02:25.304
That's a big step.

1:02:25.337 --> 1:02:28.574
Yes, she's just not ready yet
for that.

1:02:28.607 --> 1:02:33.412
- Great.
- She's just in a Bumble Bug kind of a place.

1:02:33.445 --> 1:02:35.013
Great. Have fun.

1:02:35.047 --> 1:02:36.348
I will... She will.

1:02:36.382 --> 1:02:38.217
- She will. She will.
- She will!

1:02:38.250 --> 1:02:40.052
Thank you, ladies.

1:02:40.085 --> 1:02:41.186
Have a great day!

1:02:41.220 --> 1:02:43.956
You too!

1:02:43.989 --> 1:02:47.259
If James has the baby for more
than two or three hours,

1:02:47.292 --> 1:02:50.028
first of all, the baby won't eat
because I'm the source of...

1:02:50.062 --> 1:02:51.230
Oh, no...

1:02:52.164 --> 1:02:54.099
Hey!

1:02:54.133 --> 1:02:55.434
You guys stop for a second.
Stop for a second.

1:02:55.467 --> 1:02:57.503
I need to look up
directions for...

1:02:57.536 --> 1:02:59.405
What are you talking about?
We know exactly where we are.

1:02:59.438 --> 1:03:01.240
Ooh, he just turned
and looked at her.

1:03:01.273 --> 1:03:03.041
- What do I do now?
- Did you do the glance back?

1:03:03.075 --> 1:03:04.176
- Did you do the glance back?
- No.

1:03:04.209 --> 1:03:05.577
Just easy breezy...

1:03:05.611 --> 1:03:06.646
- Here I go.
- Don't look.

1:03:06.679 --> 1:03:08.147
I love you, too.

1:03:08.180 --> 1:03:11.350
Ooh, "love you, too."

1:03:11.383 --> 1:03:13.952
Oh, that did not go good.

1:03:13.986 --> 1:03:16.155
- That felt not good.
- That was a good try.

1:03:16.188 --> 1:03:17.189
Um...

1:03:17.757 --> 1:03:19.191
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:03:19.224 --> 1:03:20.592
Ta-da! Sorry.

1:03:20.626 --> 1:03:21.661
It's weird, I, um...

1:03:21.694 --> 1:03:24.563
I just chased your friend
down the street, and I...

1:03:24.596 --> 1:03:26.231
- That's weird.
- Nice. You know what?

1:03:26.265 --> 1:03:29.101
We're gonna meet you
on the subway platform.

1:03:29.134 --> 1:03:31.638
333. I'm out! Bye!

1:03:31.671 --> 1:03:34.206
- We'll see you on the sub. Careful.
- Bye!

1:03:34.239 --> 1:03:36.175
Um, I just...

1:03:36.208 --> 1:03:37.710
I wanted to say that, um,

1:03:37.744 --> 1:03:39.746
I was talking to my son
on the phone,

1:03:39.779 --> 1:03:43.549
and I thought maybe you
overheard and misunderstood.

1:03:43.582 --> 1:03:44.616
I don't know how to do this.

1:03:44.651 --> 1:03:48.454
I was married for 15 years
and just got divorced.

1:03:48.487 --> 1:03:50.556
Oh, I just got divorced, too.

1:03:51.256 --> 1:03:52.725
Shit. I'm sorry.

1:03:52.759 --> 1:03:54.460
- I... Yeah.
- You too.

1:03:55.194 --> 1:03:57.029
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

1:03:57.062 --> 1:04:01.099
Uh, I'm just here selling
my parents' place.

1:04:01.133 --> 1:04:02.735
I live...
I'm flying back to Chicago.

1:04:02.769 --> 1:04:04.336
- Oh, okay.
- Um...

1:04:04.369 --> 1:04:06.405
I have to come back
in like a month for closing

1:04:06.438 --> 1:04:08.040
and hand off keys.

1:04:08.073 --> 1:04:12.010
So I'd love to take
you out to dinner or...

1:04:12.044 --> 1:04:14.546
Yeah, I would...
I would love that.

1:04:14.580 --> 1:04:17.049
I would like that too. So...

1:04:17.082 --> 1:04:18.584
Um, what's your name?

1:04:18.617 --> 1:04:20.486
- I'm Jennie.
- Okay.

1:04:20.519 --> 1:04:22.254
No, no, no, honey, I'm fine.

1:04:22.287 --> 1:04:24.389
I don't need
anything emotionally.

1:04:24.423 --> 1:04:26.191
I can just take care
of myself with eating...

1:04:26.225 --> 1:04:27.794
...and drinking.

1:04:27.827 --> 1:04:30.062
I'm doing great. I'm so happy.
I'm so happy to have you here.

1:04:31.831 --> 1:04:34.066
You know, we didn't even...

1:04:34.099 --> 1:04:36.034
We hardly fought at all
or anything.

1:04:36.068 --> 1:04:37.469
She's a wonderful person.

1:04:38.303 --> 1:04:40.038
Just it's...

1:04:40.072 --> 1:04:42.174
It's just...
It's so strange being...

1:04:44.243 --> 1:04:46.779
with someone
for so many years and...

1:04:46.813 --> 1:04:48.213
and still being so lonely.

1:04:49.849 --> 1:04:51.049
You guys lonely?

1:04:51.684 --> 1:04:52.685
Honestly?

1:04:53.853 --> 1:04:55.087
No.

1:04:55.120 --> 1:04:56.355
- No.
- I wasn't.

1:04:56.388 --> 1:04:57.489
Hmm.

1:04:57.523 --> 1:05:00.325
It's kind of shitty
about the whole thing. I was...

1:05:00.359 --> 1:05:02.461
I was fine. I was content.

1:05:02.494 --> 1:05:04.162
- Yeah, but that's just not enough.
- No.

1:05:04.196 --> 1:05:06.799
You can't go through life
just being content.

1:05:06.833 --> 1:05:07.734
Apparently not.

1:05:07.767 --> 1:05:09.802
It's not possible
to be happy all the time.

1:05:09.836 --> 1:05:12.404
You can't spend 60 years
with the same person

1:05:12.437 --> 1:05:14.306
- in a constant state of euphoria.
- Yes!

1:05:14.339 --> 1:05:16.843
- No, it's crazy!
- Yes, you totally can. No, it's not.

1:05:16.876 --> 1:05:19.177
This. Right now,
this is amazing.

1:05:19.211 --> 1:05:21.213
I mean, I haven't felt this in years,

1:05:21.246 --> 1:05:22.614
and everything
that you say is...

1:05:22.649 --> 1:05:26.585
is amazing and profound
and funny.

1:05:26.618 --> 1:05:29.321
You know what? I feel
amazing and profound.

1:05:29.354 --> 1:05:30.322
We're not. We're not that funny.

1:05:30.355 --> 1:05:32.457
- We're not that amazing. It's, uh...
- What?

1:05:32.491 --> 1:05:34.359
This will all wear off. It will.

1:05:34.393 --> 1:05:37.095
The second we sleep together,
if we sleep together,

1:05:37.129 --> 1:05:40.132
the tingles go down immediately.
Like at least 50%

1:05:40.165 --> 1:05:43.135
50%? Are you that bad in bed?

1:05:43.168 --> 1:05:46.471
Shut up.
No, it's like... Come on.

1:05:46.505 --> 1:05:51.243
This is... This is incredible,
but it can't last.

1:05:51.276 --> 1:05:53.713
This is shiny and new.

1:05:53.746 --> 1:05:59.217
- It wears off and then what?
- That is asinine.

1:05:59.251 --> 1:06:01.788
Did you just say "asinine"?
I love that word. Asinine.

1:06:01.821 --> 1:06:06.859
See? Peculiar. Funny. Profound. Amazing. All of it.

1:06:06.893 --> 1:06:10.095
Especially peculiar,
but nevermind.

1:06:11.798 --> 1:06:14.600
This is so strange.
I really thought that, uh,

1:06:15.434 --> 1:06:17.904
saying goodbye
to this empty house

1:06:17.937 --> 1:06:21.206
with my parents gone
was gonna be so depressing.

1:06:21.239 --> 1:06:24.711
But instead, it's, um...

1:06:26.478 --> 1:06:28.347
Thank you for coming over.

1:06:29.314 --> 1:06:31.651
Thank you for sharing this.

1:06:31.684 --> 1:06:34.453
- Goodbye, house.
- Goodbye.

1:06:36.756 --> 1:06:38.423
Hm.

1:06:41.460 --> 1:06:42.762
Come on.

1:06:45.865 --> 1:06:48.467
Ta-da!

1:06:48.500 --> 1:06:51.203
This was my childhood bedroom.

1:06:51.236 --> 1:06:53.940
Wow. Mine and Robby's.

1:06:53.973 --> 1:06:56.308
Uh, this was
Robby's side of the room.

1:06:56.341 --> 1:06:59.611
Mine was over there,
and, uh, bed was here.

1:06:59.646 --> 1:07:01.380
My little desk was over there.

1:07:01.413 --> 1:07:02.915
And, um...

1:07:02.949 --> 1:07:06.284
We had track lighting,
terrible track lighting,

1:07:06.318 --> 1:07:08.453
but we would adjust
the spotlights

1:07:08.487 --> 1:07:10.790
and make like a dance floor

1:07:10.823 --> 1:07:15.828
and Robby did,
uh, this techno music

1:07:15.862 --> 1:07:18.263
that we would...
I'm about to blow your mind.

1:07:18.296 --> 1:07:20.465
All right.

1:07:20.499 --> 1:07:22.802
Oops.

1:07:22.835 --> 1:07:25.404
Oh, I'm sorry. I just, uh...
I just read that.

1:07:25.437 --> 1:07:28.675
Yep, all right.
Okay, let's see your moves.

1:07:28.708 --> 1:07:30.677
- Try out the dance floor.
- Okay.

1:07:30.710 --> 1:07:33.680
'Cause obviously,
I'm a professional so...

1:07:33.713 --> 1:07:36.281
Uh, was that your wife?

1:07:36.314 --> 1:07:40.419
Yeah. Um, yeah,
but we're separated.

1:07:40.452 --> 1:07:43.690
It's just...
It's more complicated with kids.

1:07:43.723 --> 1:07:45.557
You said you were divorced.

1:07:45.590 --> 1:07:48.326
Well, we're not divorced yet.

1:07:48.360 --> 1:07:52.799
She's fighting it, and I asked
for a few months

1:07:52.832 --> 1:07:55.567
just to get my shit cleared up.

1:07:55.600 --> 1:07:57.502
- 'Cause selling this place has...
- Uh, I'm...

1:07:57.536 --> 1:08:00.807
I'm not interested
in being this.

1:08:00.840 --> 1:08:03.408
- No.
- Jennie, Jennie. Jennie, uh...

1:08:04.409 --> 1:08:06.611
Okay, I... Please, um...

1:08:09.581 --> 1:08:14.821
I'm sorry, I...
If I misled you or...

1:08:17.289 --> 1:08:19.726
I feel kind of lost here, um...

1:08:20.827 --> 1:08:23.295
But nothing happened, and we...

1:08:23.328 --> 1:08:27.399
Nothing happened.
You just made me laugh and...

1:08:27.432 --> 1:08:28.668
bought cannolis for me

1:08:28.701 --> 1:08:30.368
and told me stories
about your kids,

1:08:30.402 --> 1:08:32.638
and where you did homework
as a little boy.

1:08:33.973 --> 1:08:37.043
Give her
this opportunity, Clark.

1:08:37.076 --> 1:08:39.679
Tell her she's funny and amazing
and see what happens.

1:08:39.712 --> 1:08:41.647
- She will light up. I guarantee it.
- No.

1:08:41.681 --> 1:08:43.716
- I guarantee it.
- No, she won't. Jennie, she won't.

1:08:44.549 --> 1:08:47.019
I've tried. And laughs,

1:08:47.053 --> 1:08:49.722
I don't remember the last time
that we laughed together.

1:08:53.025 --> 1:08:55.762
I was thinking
on my flight here,

1:08:55.795 --> 1:08:58.330
I don't know if I can do this.

1:09:00.099 --> 1:09:03.535
I'm 44 years old, and I have
no idea who the fuck I am.

1:09:03.568 --> 1:09:05.872
- Tell her, Clark.
- I have tried.

1:09:05.905 --> 1:09:09.441
Tell her, not me. Tell her.

1:09:09.474 --> 1:09:11.077
- Jennie...
- And if she changes the subject

1:09:11.110 --> 1:09:12.712
and acts like
she didn't hear you,

1:09:12.745 --> 1:09:16.816
you just grab her face
and you say, "I am lost.

1:09:16.849 --> 1:09:19.652
"I am not happy.
I don't know who the fuck I am."

1:09:20.787 --> 1:09:23.388
- Jennie...
- Tell her, Clark.

1:09:24.123 --> 1:09:25.925
Make her hear you.

1:09:30.029 --> 1:09:32.397
<i>You let me think we were happy</i>

1:09:34.399 --> 1:09:37.402
until the end
and secretly you moved on.

1:09:39.806 --> 1:09:41.841
So sorry. I feel like
I'm wasting your time.

1:09:42.875 --> 1:09:44.376
This is...

1:09:44.409 --> 1:09:45.912
I hear what you're saying
and I can't seem to...

1:09:45.945 --> 1:09:47.445
I'm so sorry.

1:09:54.921 --> 1:09:57.422
- How'd it go?
- Uh, not good.

1:10:29.822 --> 1:10:32.424
Remember the little gold Buddha
that Miss Tucker gave me?

1:10:32.457 --> 1:10:34.459
Buddha, is that what
you're looking for?

1:10:34.492 --> 1:10:36.829
I wish I were the kind of person
who could go.

1:10:36.863 --> 1:10:39.665
I wish I were the kind of person
who could just go to Thailand.

1:10:39.699 --> 1:10:40.867
I wish I were
that kind of person.

1:10:40.900 --> 1:10:42.434
And then I thought,

1:10:42.467 --> 1:10:43.936
"Well, what if I were
that kind of person?"

1:10:43.970 --> 1:10:45.537
What if I were
the kind of person

1:10:45.570 --> 1:10:47.472
who could just type Bangkok,
one passenger,

1:10:47.505 --> 1:10:49.909
hit "buy" without thinking
or asking your parents?

1:10:49.942 --> 1:10:50.977
What if I were
that kind of person

1:10:51.010 --> 1:10:52.410
who could just travel on my own?

1:10:52.444 --> 1:10:53.846
What if I were
that kind of fearless person?

1:10:53.880 --> 1:10:55.982
You are a fearless person.

1:10:56.015 --> 1:10:57.783
Are you kidding, Dad?
Did you?

1:10:58.751 --> 1:10:59.952
I'm terrified.

1:10:59.986 --> 1:11:01.453
I have always been terrified.

1:11:01.486 --> 1:11:03.089
When have you ever been scared?

1:11:03.122 --> 1:11:04.757
You've never seemed
scared to me.

1:11:04.790 --> 1:11:07.660
You are one of the strongest
women I have ever known.

1:11:07.693 --> 1:11:09.527
You don't think of me
as a scared person.

1:11:09.561 --> 1:11:10.963
No, no. My God.

1:11:10.997 --> 1:11:12.932
What kind of scared person
decides at 15 years old

1:11:12.965 --> 1:11:14.834
that she wants to be an actress?

1:11:14.867 --> 1:11:17.435
It's one of the scariest careers
on the planet,

1:11:17.469 --> 1:11:20.773
and you chose to do it
in New York City, Jen.

1:11:20.806 --> 1:11:22.208
Scared people don't live there.

1:11:22.241 --> 1:11:24.844
Scared people
don't dream big dreams.

1:11:24.877 --> 1:11:28.080
Scared people have
Plan Bs and Cs and Ds.

1:11:28.114 --> 1:11:31.583
- You didn't.
- Well, I should have.

1:11:31.616 --> 1:11:33.451
I should...
I should have thought at 15,

1:11:33.485 --> 1:11:35.121
"Okay, well,
what if I'm 40 years old

1:11:35.154 --> 1:11:38.090
"and the thought of having
a couple of great kids

1:11:38.124 --> 1:11:39.759
"and having a husband
who adores me

1:11:39.792 --> 1:11:41.526
"and running home to make
them dinner between shows

1:11:41.559 --> 1:11:42.995
"is nowhere in sight."

1:11:53.739 --> 1:11:55.607
Please. Please.

1:12:03.282 --> 1:12:05.651
Your dad's still downstairs
looking for it.

1:12:06.752 --> 1:12:07.787
Hmm.

1:12:17.797 --> 1:12:19.865
I would do anything
in this world

1:12:19.899 --> 1:12:22.500
if I could take your pain away.

1:12:22.534 --> 1:12:24.971
I would absorb
every bit of it if I could.

1:12:27.539 --> 1:12:30.109
But what I'm realizing right now

1:12:30.142 --> 1:12:33.779
is that in our attempts
to protect you,

1:12:34.512 --> 1:12:36.716
I think we've robbed you
in a way

1:12:36.749 --> 1:12:39.018
of you finding
your own strength,

1:12:39.051 --> 1:12:41.721
your own sense of self.

1:12:41.754 --> 1:12:45.257
And I am just so, so sorry
if we've done that.

1:12:45.291 --> 1:12:47.126
Mom, you and Dad were...

1:12:47.159 --> 1:12:48.626
You did nothing wrong.

1:12:49.195 --> 1:12:50.595
If anything, you were...

1:12:51.664 --> 1:12:52.932
You were so perfect.

1:12:58.270 --> 1:13:00.206
I feel so stupid.

1:13:05.945 --> 1:13:07.079
It's okay.

1:13:08.247 --> 1:13:09.682
It's okay.

1:13:12.952 --> 1:13:14.687
Well...

1:13:14.720 --> 1:13:17.023
I want to tell you something
about your dad and I.

1:13:17.056 --> 1:13:19.759
Oh, God, no, Mom, no.
I can't. I can't.

1:13:19.792 --> 1:13:22.560
- If you tell me Dad cheated or something.
- Oh, no, honey. Never.

1:13:22.594 --> 1:13:24.230
Oh, no, no, no.
Your dad is the best.

1:13:24.263 --> 1:13:25.831
He's the best.

1:13:25.865 --> 1:13:27.166
It's not about that.

1:13:33.372 --> 1:13:37.643
If I could go back,
I would do it all again.

1:13:38.744 --> 1:13:40.146
Exactly the same.

1:13:41.714 --> 1:13:44.283
But there is this small part
of me that wonders

1:13:45.351 --> 1:13:47.753
who we would be
if we weren't we.

1:13:50.956 --> 1:13:53.325
You sort of decide
who you are as a team

1:13:53.359 --> 1:13:56.028
and if it works,
you don't change it.

1:13:58.798 --> 1:14:05.137
I look at you as your mom,
and I think...

1:14:05.171 --> 1:14:08.841
you have this opportunity
to be whoever you wanna be.

1:14:21.387 --> 1:14:23.956
Oh! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1:14:23.989 --> 1:14:25.291
<i>The thing is...</i>

1:14:26.725 --> 1:14:29.161
<i>I always thought
I was a weak person.</i>

1:14:31.263 --> 1:14:32.465
<i>But it's not that.</i>

1:14:32.498 --> 1:14:34.867
<i>I guess I'm realizing now
that it's more that, I just,</i>

1:14:34.900 --> 1:14:39.905
<i>I wasn't sure that I was
a strong person underneath.</i>

1:14:39.939 --> 1:14:41.841
<i>I didn't trust that if the shit
ever hit the fan</i>

1:14:41.874 --> 1:14:43.375
<i>that I wouldn't just crumble.
But you know what</i>

1:14:43.409 --> 1:14:45.010
<i>is so fucking great...</i>

1:14:46.712 --> 1:14:47.980
the more that you hurt me,

1:14:48.013 --> 1:14:49.215
the more that you
just push down on me,

1:14:49.248 --> 1:14:51.417
the more this other thing
pushes up.

1:14:51.450 --> 1:14:53.018
It's like this solid pushback
that's like,

1:14:53.052 --> 1:14:56.188
"No, no, you are not
gonna hold me under."

1:14:56.222 --> 1:14:58.657
And the stronger the push,
the stronger the pushback.

1:15:00.759 --> 1:15:03.229
I don't... I don't know
how long it's been there,

1:15:03.262 --> 1:15:06.065
probably forever, but I never
really needed it until now.

1:15:06.098 --> 1:15:08.868
But it's... it's this...

1:15:08.901 --> 1:15:12.171
<i>This thing that's allowing me
to somehow be okay</i>

1:15:12.204 --> 1:15:13.205
with standing here
in front of you,

1:15:13.239 --> 1:15:16.976
telling you that unless
you fight for me now,

1:15:18.711 --> 1:15:21.380
I'm walking away.

1:15:21.413 --> 1:15:26.318
I'm not gonna be this woman
who just will take scraps.

1:15:28.087 --> 1:15:31.223
I won't sit around and wait
for you to love me again.

1:15:31.257 --> 1:15:35.661
<i>Delaney...</i> JENNIE: <i>Alex, stop...
with the lies.</i>

1:15:38.130 --> 1:15:41.267
There are so many things
I would love to hear you say,

1:15:43.035 --> 1:15:45.037
but if they're not true,
please...

1:15:47.740 --> 1:15:49.008
Please don't say it.

1:16:10.162 --> 1:16:12.298
- You were incredible.
- Oh...

1:16:12.331 --> 1:16:14.433
- Thank you.
- Amazing, really.

1:16:15.401 --> 1:16:17.436
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1:16:32.384 --> 1:16:34.286
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:16:34.320 --> 1:16:37.223
- Thank you for the flowers.
- Oh, of course.

1:16:37.623 --> 1:16:38.991
That was...

1:16:40.526 --> 1:16:42.795
You were so great, babe.

1:16:42.828 --> 1:16:45.531
Jennie. You were so great.

1:16:45.564 --> 1:16:47.032
Thank you.

1:16:47.066 --> 1:16:49.101
I didn't... I didn't know
you were in town.

1:16:49.134 --> 1:16:50.836
You're doing, uh, a delivery?

1:16:50.869 --> 1:16:54.240
Yeah, just a quick one.
Brought one up from Virginia.

1:16:54.273 --> 1:16:55.307
<i>The Bimini Cricket.</i>

1:16:55.341 --> 1:16:56.809
<i>"The Bimini Cricket"?</i>
That's the name of the...

1:16:56.842 --> 1:16:59.445
That's asinine.

1:17:01.213 --> 1:17:03.882
- You've been busy and...
- Uh, a little bit.

1:17:03.916 --> 1:17:05.184
Mostly rigging work.

1:17:05.217 --> 1:17:07.319
A few deliveries
here and there, but...

1:17:07.353 --> 1:17:08.554
That's good.

1:17:08.587 --> 1:17:10.022
This is...

1:17:10.055 --> 1:17:12.558
Yeah. Yeah, this has been...

1:17:12.591 --> 1:17:15.294
Uh, it's wrapping up on Sunday,
but it's... it's, uh...

1:17:15.327 --> 1:17:16.228
Oh, you're closing?

1:17:16.262 --> 1:17:19.098
Uh, they're extending again.
It's been...

1:17:19.131 --> 1:17:21.967
But I'm... I decided to leave.
I'm leaving.

1:17:22.001 --> 1:17:25.371
It's a lot. It's a year
of pushing on bruises, so...

1:17:25.404 --> 1:17:29.508
- A year?
- Yeah, it was last October that, um...

1:17:29.541 --> 1:17:31.844
Oh, that's right.

1:17:32.945 --> 1:17:34.780
Seeing you again, it's...

1:17:36.181 --> 1:17:37.983
It's weird. It's not...

1:17:38.550 --> 1:17:39.985
It's not what I imagined.

1:17:40.019 --> 1:17:42.221
Yeah. Me either.

1:17:43.956 --> 1:17:48.160
I keep wanting to grab
your hand, which is weird but...

1:17:49.261 --> 1:17:51.330
Hey, Jennie,
we're ready for you.

1:17:51.363 --> 1:17:53.165
I'll be...

1:17:53.198 --> 1:17:55.134
No rush. Take your time.

1:17:55.167 --> 1:17:58.504
They're throwing a little going
away thing between shows, so...

1:17:58.537 --> 1:18:00.105
Oh, I'm sorry. If you need to...

1:18:00.139 --> 1:18:01.840
No, no, no, no, no. This is...

1:18:03.275 --> 1:18:06.945
I've... This was good.

1:18:09.114 --> 1:18:10.316
You look so beautiful.

1:18:10.349 --> 1:18:12.051
Thank you.

1:18:12.084 --> 1:18:13.519
Whisky and cornflakes.

Jen...

1:18:35.007 --> 1:18:36.508
I don't know
why I told you that.

1:18:38.243 --> 1:18:40.245
That night.

1:18:40.279 --> 1:18:43.515
That I wouldn't have come back
on the boat.

1:18:48.153 --> 1:18:50.022
I don't know
what the truth is anymore.

1:18:53.559 --> 1:18:54.893
Thank you.
