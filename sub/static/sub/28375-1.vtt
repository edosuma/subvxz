00:20.882 --> 00:22.643
- Look at you.

00:22.677 --> 00:25.611
With your smartphones,
your flat whites,

00:25.646 --> 00:29.063
your power shakes, your SUVs,

00:29.098 --> 00:31.445
stuffing your faces
while the world burns.

00:34.551 --> 00:36.553
Do you like what they gave you?

00:36.588 --> 00:37.727
You fat enough yet?

00:38.728 --> 00:39.729
Do you feel cheated?

00:41.455 --> 00:42.490
You cheat yourself.

00:43.457 --> 00:44.803
You go on cheating yourselves,

00:44.837 --> 00:48.013
accepting their gifts
because you're stupid,

00:48.048 --> 00:51.189
lazy, downtrodden, fearful.

00:52.328 --> 00:53.363
Wake up.

00:55.158 --> 00:56.884
They are not in charge.

00:58.851 --> 01:02.890
- Without us, they have
no money, no labor,

01:02.924 --> 01:04.098
no infrastructure.

01:04.132 --> 01:05.236
You can't turn back the clock,

01:05.272 --> 01:06.238
say here's your wine.

01:06.273 --> 01:07.067
Well enough.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.861
Stand the fuck up
and be counted!

01:08.896 --> 01:10.967
Because this is the time!

01:11.001 --> 01:13.107
This is the place!

01:13.142 --> 01:14.350
And you.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.909
You are the person.

01:34.232 --> 01:38.512
- The RFID chip is
painless and totally free.

01:38.546 --> 01:40.134
- We'll empty banks,

01:40.169 --> 01:42.205
interrupt the web,

01:42.240 --> 01:44.587
encrypt satellites, GPS.

01:44.621 --> 01:47.521
We're gonna bring down your
house and watch it burn.

01:49.178 --> 01:51.594
- This kid hacked
into the federal reserve,

01:51.628 --> 01:53.803
the world bank, and five multi,

01:53.837 --> 01:54.735
he almost bankrupt the city.

01:54.769 --> 01:56.288
- Nash Jones.

01:56.323 --> 01:57.496
Brother of Hardin.

01:57.531 --> 02:00.085
Prisoner 4011787.
- He can get to anyone.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.328
Including him.

02:01.362 --> 02:04.779
- And even
visit panopticon TV.

02:04.814 --> 02:07.196
Drama has never been so real.

02:58.557 --> 03:00.318
- Tell me about
your brother, Nash.

03:04.943 --> 03:08.981
Burned fingerprints,
drugged eyeballs.

03:12.330 --> 03:15.574
Even super recognizers
couldn't pick him up.

03:18.267 --> 03:19.751
Don't worry, he's still alive.

03:21.270 --> 03:22.409
Very much so in fact.

03:23.962 --> 03:25.274
He and his little posse

03:28.069 --> 03:29.416
hacked the Federal Reserve.

03:33.109 --> 03:34.662
A lot of people are very upset.

03:35.836 --> 03:38.942
It's election year,
they need a scalp.

03:40.599 --> 03:45.017
You give Nash up and
all this goes away.

03:46.295 --> 03:48.020
Every prior conviction.

03:49.367 --> 03:52.370
Clean sheet, start over.

03:53.543 --> 03:56.236
I'll see to it Nash
gets a fair trial.

03:57.616 --> 04:00.723
Possibly just a
slap on the wrist,

04:02.172 --> 04:06.453
public humiliation, maybe
five years in juvie at most.

04:11.665 --> 04:14.184
I'm trying to help you, Hardin.

04:19.810 --> 04:22.676
They can get to
anyone, including him.

04:29.683 --> 04:33.134
- You said they needed
a scalp, one scalp.

04:33.169 --> 04:35.861
You've got it, that's the deal.

04:35.896 --> 04:37.449
- Don't make me do this!

04:44.387 --> 04:46.009
If you go down for this, Hardin,

04:49.254 --> 04:50.151
that's it for you.

04:53.362 --> 04:54.570
Life over.

05:56.286 --> 05:58.427
- Good job, big boy!

07:00.489 --> 07:02.629
- Only we taught them
to feel, to empathize

07:02.663 --> 07:04.182
and we just dumped them.

07:04.216 --> 07:06.391
There's no social support
for the robot class

07:06.426 --> 07:09.463
yet they have mental health
issues way beyond our spectrum.

07:09.498 --> 07:10.913
- Here at Panopticon TV,

07:10.947 --> 07:13.294
you can share the
most intimate details

07:13.329 --> 07:14.779
of Hardin's existence.

07:14.813 --> 07:16.332
Read the books Hardin reads,

07:16.366 --> 07:19.059
download his playlist
and films he likes.

07:23.270 --> 07:25.997
Loyalty customers
qualify for felon app

07:26.031 --> 07:29.207
which allows you to adopt
your very own felon,

07:29.241 --> 07:33.245
watch him 24/7 and even
visit Panopticon TV.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.455
Drama's never been so real.

07:36.973 --> 07:39.493
- We have the
censors

07:39.528 --> 07:41.530
because people are not
proud of themselves

07:41.564 --> 07:43.221
but because they don't want to.

07:44.498 --> 07:45.948
We'd rather have
someone to blame,

07:45.982 --> 07:47.225
rather be a victim.

07:48.364 --> 07:52.610
Masters or slaves,
educated or uneducated,

07:52.644 --> 07:55.475
rich have dominated
poor, so good.

07:57.269 --> 07:58.995
Every now and again someone
comes along to challenge

07:59.030 --> 08:00.928
this democratic idea.

08:00.963 --> 08:05.968
But very few

08:07.141 --> 08:10.075
And that's why the
system will change.

08:40.278 --> 08:41.797
- Welcome to the
conference, Mr. Green.

08:41.831 --> 08:43.212
- Thank you.

08:43.246 --> 08:46.560
- We also know that
Panopticon TV is a financial

08:46.595 --> 08:48.804
and ratings success.

08:48.838 --> 08:52.221
What if Prison TV
could be expanded

08:52.255 --> 08:54.568
to a whole new town?

08:54.603 --> 08:57.191
Where felons live, work,

08:57.226 --> 09:00.332
and earn their way
back into society?

09:00.367 --> 09:02.921
Newtown not only finances itself

09:02.956 --> 09:05.545
via subscriptions
and advertising,

09:05.579 --> 09:10.550
it provides thousands of jobs
for the long term unemployed.

09:11.447 --> 09:12.931
tHe town is up and running

09:14.346 --> 09:17.764
and Hardin Jones will be
the first felon to test it.

09:17.798 --> 09:19.455
Welcome to Newtown.

09:32.917 --> 09:34.159
- Why is he
being transferred?

09:34.194 --> 09:35.575
- He's launching the new show,

09:35.609 --> 09:38.025
Panopticon Interactive: Newtown.

09:38.060 --> 09:39.544
It's cool, really.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.063
You tune in, you can live there

09:41.097 --> 09:42.478
and even interact
with the felons.

09:42.512 --> 09:44.376
- And everybody gets to watch.

09:44.411 --> 09:46.137
Like Panopticon TV.

09:46.171 --> 09:47.863
- It's more
interactive than that.

09:47.897 --> 09:49.450
There's subscribers
who can choose

09:49.485 --> 09:51.176
who passes and who fails.

09:51.211 --> 09:53.938
And if you pass, you
get to rejoin society.

09:53.972 --> 09:55.180
- And that's a prize?

09:56.078 --> 09:57.044
- What if you fail?

10:00.565 --> 10:01.980
When's he being transferred?

10:02.015 --> 10:03.637
- Why not spring him?

10:03.672 --> 10:06.260
- Armed guards,
soldiers, trucks.

10:07.227 --> 10:08.815
This isn't our battle.

10:08.849 --> 10:10.610
We hit them where it hurts.

10:10.644 --> 10:13.302
Commerce, communication,
power grid,

10:13.336 --> 10:14.821
the workforce.
- Down the system

10:14.855 --> 10:16.339
and mute the citizens.

10:16.374 --> 10:17.858
They love him, they'll do
whatever he tells them.

10:19.446 --> 10:22.000
- He's your brother,
and you want him out.

10:22.035 --> 10:24.002
All right, I get that.

10:24.037 --> 10:26.418
But we don't have the
firepower or the numbers.

10:26.453 --> 10:28.628
- But we have other weapons.

10:28.662 --> 10:30.284
Think about it, B.

10:30.319 --> 10:32.045
They gotta take him
out of the city,

10:32.079 --> 10:34.116
desert, straight shot.

10:34.150 --> 10:35.393
I say we hit the convoy.

10:35.427 --> 10:38.396
- I could access the
dashboard functions.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.501
Steering, brakes, transmission.

10:40.536 --> 10:41.675
You just tell me where
you want the convoy

10:41.710 --> 10:42.572
and I'll send it.

10:44.989 --> 10:47.681
- Two billion subscribers.

10:49.718 --> 10:50.650
How long you think
it's gonna take

10:50.684 --> 10:51.823
to find access like that?

10:53.238 --> 10:54.861
When Hardin wears a
particular brand of jeans,

10:54.895 --> 10:56.448
they sell out in two hours.

10:56.483 --> 10:57.691
- Gotta show 'em
we mean business.

10:57.726 --> 10:59.313
- They'll know we mean business.

11:07.943 --> 11:08.875
All right.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.361
But I want that fit sorted.

11:12.395 --> 11:14.881
And I want that fucker
Lyndon to know what's coming.

11:17.918 --> 11:19.230
Your brother better
come through.

11:19.264 --> 11:21.301
- He hates those
fuckers more than we do.

11:22.509 --> 11:23.337
- He better.

11:25.581 --> 11:26.409
- Showtime.

11:55.818 --> 11:57.199
- Here at Newtown,

11:57.233 --> 12:00.202
we offer a more
fulfilled existence.

12:00.236 --> 12:03.688
One where you can realize your
dreams while getting paid.

12:03.723 --> 12:08.693
Newtown is safe, clean and
currently accepting residents.

12:46.524 --> 12:47.697
- Wakey wakey.

12:59.675 --> 13:02.436
- You're going to
be transferred, Hardin.

13:02.471 --> 13:04.231
No more fights.

13:04.266 --> 13:06.406
A kind of halfway house.

13:06.440 --> 13:09.236
Shops, bars, girls.

13:10.651 --> 13:13.620
This is a big
opportunity for you.

13:39.094 --> 13:41.268
- Going west on six.

13:50.036 --> 13:51.416
- You got another
assignment there, Central?

13:51.451 --> 13:53.660
- We have a redirection
order, just confirming.

13:53.694 --> 13:55.489
- Redirection confirmed.

14:00.632 --> 14:03.221
- Drama's
never been so real.

14:19.237 --> 14:20.411
- Go, go, go go!

14:57.137 --> 14:58.794
- Take off the traffic lights.

14:58.828 --> 14:59.968
Take them out.

15:23.370 --> 15:24.716
- Jam, goddamit.

15:26.028 --> 15:27.443
- Go, go, go, go!

15:46.980 --> 15:47.808
- Hardin!

15:51.778 --> 15:52.606
Shit.

16:07.690 --> 16:08.898
- Why did he run?

16:08.933 --> 16:10.107
- He wouldn't
have known who we are.

16:10.141 --> 16:12.350
- What, your own brother
doesn't recognize you?

16:12.385 --> 16:13.731
Does he even know who he is?

16:15.077 --> 16:17.804
We lost three good
men today, three.

16:17.838 --> 16:18.632
And for what?

16:19.530 --> 16:21.187
A fucking brain dead messiah?

16:21.221 --> 16:22.360
- We need to find him.

16:22.395 --> 16:23.223
- No.

16:23.258 --> 16:24.431
We stick to the plan,

16:24.466 --> 16:26.882
the one we've been
preparing for.

16:26.916 --> 16:28.573
He's chipped up to the eyeballs.

16:28.608 --> 16:30.886
They follow him, they follow us.

16:30.920 --> 16:31.714
- He's my brother.

16:31.749 --> 16:32.957
- Was.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.236
Harvesters, organ
buses, crazed fans.

16:36.271 --> 16:37.375
He's already gone.

16:39.688 --> 16:42.035
From now on, we stick
to the fucking plan.

16:59.156 --> 17:03.401
- 10 prisoners,
each with an IQ over 160,

17:03.436 --> 17:05.023
all under 25.

17:05.058 --> 17:07.267
- Harden
Jones isn't under 25.

17:07.301 --> 17:11.409
- Now why would you be transferring
your biggest attraction?

17:11.444 --> 17:12.928
- Newtown.

17:12.962 --> 17:16.828
The prison overflow is a
fantastic opportunity for felons.

17:16.863 --> 17:18.520
We're talking
about a controlled,

17:18.554 --> 17:20.694
rehabilitative environment
where they learn

17:20.729 --> 17:23.180
a new trade, mix
with regular citizens

17:23.214 --> 17:25.251
and earn their way
back into society.

17:25.285 --> 17:27.666
- You know a lot of regular
citizens who like to hang out

17:27.701 --> 17:29.048
with murderers and pedophiles?

17:29.082 --> 17:31.636
- I believe you refer to
them as the unemployed.

17:31.671 --> 17:34.915
- You're not thinking of
opening this up to subscribers.

17:34.950 --> 17:37.159
- Crime's down,
consumerism's up,

17:37.194 --> 17:38.402
what's not to like?

17:40.335 --> 17:41.474
They're all chipped.

17:41.508 --> 17:43.993
We've already found
three of them.

17:44.028 --> 17:45.995
- Was Jones one of the three?

17:47.307 --> 17:48.964
- It's only a matter of time.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.000
- And what if he gets
online and starts

17:51.035 --> 17:52.209
instructing the faithful?

17:52.243 --> 17:53.693
- His brain's mush.

17:53.727 --> 17:55.177
He's had more drugs
pumped into him

17:55.212 --> 17:56.213
than Central America.

17:56.247 --> 17:57.628
- Has he?

17:57.662 --> 17:59.181
And what happens when
he finds that out,

17:59.216 --> 18:00.838
because you know, if that was me

18:00.872 --> 18:02.805
and I suddenly
discovered that I was

18:02.840 --> 18:04.876
the world's biggest
brand, I think I'd be

18:04.911 --> 18:07.120
really, really pissed.

18:11.055 --> 18:12.229
- Here at Panopticon TV,

18:12.263 --> 18:14.231
you could share the
most intimate details

18:14.265 --> 18:16.681
of Hardin's existence.

18:16.716 --> 18:18.856
Read the books Hardin reads,
download his playlists

18:18.890 --> 18:20.651
and the films he likes.

18:20.685 --> 18:23.240
Loyalty customers
qualify for felon app.

18:24.413 --> 18:26.691
- Hardin may be on
the loose right now,

18:26.726 --> 18:28.762
but in the city where the
online betting community

18:28.797 --> 18:31.627
never sleeps, it's surely
only a matter of time

18:31.662 --> 18:34.803
until odds on his recapture
become pretty attractive.

18:53.822 --> 18:55.479
- Welcome
back, Mr. Goodwin.

18:55.513 --> 18:57.481
Diagnosis, syphilis.

18:57.515 --> 19:01.588
Your medication will be
dispensed in three seconds.

19:01.623 --> 19:02.900
Have a great day.

19:02.934 --> 19:04.522
- Parking violation 313.

19:05.385 --> 19:07.732
Lethal disruption initiated.

19:17.949 --> 19:20.193
- Prisoner 4110787.

19:50.430 --> 19:51.914
- Behavioral alert.

19:51.949 --> 19:55.608
Grid H25673, please
remain in your rotation.

19:56.816 --> 19:59.405
Please remain in your rotation.

20:00.923 --> 20:02.373
- And the donut.

20:04.582 --> 20:05.687
- I need the donut.

20:05.721 --> 20:06.550
- So do I.

20:12.487 --> 20:13.660
- Behavioral alert.

20:13.695 --> 20:18.147
Grid H25673, please
remain in your rotation.

20:18.182 --> 20:20.736
Please remain in your rotation.

20:27.295 --> 20:29.262
- Hey, you wouldn't
be taking my good coat

20:29.297 --> 20:31.126
down into that sewer
now, would you?

20:39.203 --> 20:41.240
- Smoking is
not permitted in the street.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.689
It is a federal offense.

20:42.724 --> 20:44.622
Please extinguish your cigarette

20:44.657 --> 20:47.487
in the cans provided
or face a minimum fine

20:47.522 --> 20:48.695
of 50,000 won.

20:49.834 --> 20:51.422
You have 10 seconds.

20:52.906 --> 20:54.425
Nine, eight, seven.

21:15.619 --> 21:18.691
- Facefirst, the
only 10 key biometric

21:18.725 --> 21:20.451
face recognition solution

21:20.486 --> 21:22.488
with revolutionary flexibility

21:22.522 --> 21:26.112
in inquisition,
identification and alerting.

21:26.146 --> 21:27.872
Live hi-definition video

21:27.907 --> 21:29.288
enables Facefirst
to track, isolate,

21:46.650 --> 21:48.790
- We want an end to
mandatory fingerprinting

21:48.824 --> 21:50.550
and prison TV.

21:50.585 --> 21:52.311
We want an independent
corruption trial

21:52.345 --> 21:55.072
for all successive governments
up to the present day

21:55.106 --> 21:58.006
and a reintroduction of
the Glass-Steagall act.

21:58.040 --> 22:00.180
Should you fail to
comply, we will empty

22:00.215 --> 22:02.355
two international
banks of all currency

22:02.390 --> 22:03.943
and distribute the money.

22:03.977 --> 22:06.739
We will set up our own
courts live and online,

22:06.773 --> 22:09.535
interrupt web transmissions,
release prisoners,

22:09.569 --> 22:11.468
plunge the city into darkness.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.436
Our demands are reasonable.

22:14.471 --> 22:16.231
We ask only the same of you.

22:17.508 --> 22:20.856
Four demands, seven
days, no negotiation.

22:30.866 --> 22:32.523
- Is this for real?

22:32.558 --> 22:33.938
They sound like kids.

22:33.973 --> 22:34.870
- They are kids.

22:34.905 --> 22:35.733
- Well, these kids have names?

22:35.768 --> 22:36.665
- It's their group.

22:36.700 --> 22:37.942
- But they have profiles, right?

22:37.977 --> 22:39.634
- Can't arrest
every border aspect

22:39.668 --> 22:40.738
under 20 who lives at home.

22:40.773 --> 22:41.739
- Why not?

22:41.774 --> 22:43.085
- You'd look like Herod.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.742
- Well infiltrate
their chatrooms.

22:44.777 --> 22:45.674
Find addresses.

22:45.709 --> 22:47.642
I mean they're online 24-7.

22:47.676 --> 22:49.368
- We're dealing with a
sophisticated hive mind here.

22:49.402 --> 22:50.955
You can't just go in
and pretend to be a bee.

22:50.990 --> 22:52.405
- Can they do it?

22:52.440 --> 22:54.373
- Yeah banks have been
emptied remotely before.

22:54.407 --> 22:57.410
They also sent a
37 plate memorandum

22:57.445 --> 22:59.585
to accompany their video
and it's pretty inclusive.

22:59.619 --> 23:01.034
They've done their research.

23:02.242 --> 23:04.037
Taxes reduced from
60 to 20 percent

23:04.072 --> 23:05.936
for all citizens
living in the suburbs.

23:05.970 --> 23:07.903
28 percent for those in cities.

23:07.938 --> 23:10.043
And corporations pay 100 percent

23:10.078 --> 23:11.251
as the fine for the first year

23:11.286 --> 23:13.875
and then 26.7
percent thereafter.

23:13.909 --> 23:16.153
These kids sound
pretty organized.

23:16.187 --> 23:19.087
- Let's just hope
they're bluffing.

23:28.061 --> 23:29.822
- I can't access
the data warehouses.

23:29.856 --> 23:31.479
Nielsen runs too tight a ship.

23:31.513 --> 23:33.964
Robotics 916 who
makes the chips,

23:33.998 --> 23:35.724
they're much less secure.

23:35.759 --> 23:38.486
Here's a list of all
the RFID serial numbers

23:38.520 --> 23:40.142
allocated to each jail.

23:40.177 --> 23:42.075
There's currently
eight active chips

23:42.110 --> 23:44.871
outside the jail with
two within the same host.

23:44.906 --> 23:46.355
I'm assuming that's Hardin.

23:46.390 --> 23:47.529
I'm guessing it's
one from the jail

23:47.564 --> 23:49.255
and one from the advertisers.

23:49.289 --> 23:51.153
He's worth a lot
of money to them.

23:51.188 --> 23:53.362
- Well, you can hack
and check on this?

23:53.397 --> 23:55.226
How many other people
can access this?

23:55.261 --> 23:57.643
- They'd have to
be as good as me.

23:57.677 --> 23:59.541
- Well but if he knows he's
chipped, he'll lose them.

23:59.576 --> 24:01.440
- Well so long as they're
not second generation.

24:01.474 --> 24:03.442
Those'll burn out if
you tamper with them.

24:03.476 --> 24:05.098
- Where is he now?

24:07.031 --> 24:08.999
- He looks around grid six.

24:09.033 --> 24:09.965
- Yeah.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.691
- Near the old train tracks.

25:23.418 --> 25:24.971
- I need to find a home.

25:25.006 --> 25:27.146
I can live with
children and animals

25:27.180 --> 25:29.251
and my battery
condition is excellent.

25:29.286 --> 25:30.114
- Next.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.359
Next.

25:34.602 --> 25:35.464
Card.

25:37.121 --> 25:38.088
Remove your shades.

25:42.575 --> 25:44.577
How long have you been
in the penal system?

25:46.234 --> 25:47.580
- 10 years.

25:47.615 --> 25:48.477
- Kidneys okay?

25:49.651 --> 25:51.860
Kidneys and corneas,
there's a shortage.

25:53.724 --> 25:55.554
- Just
need the food stamps.

25:56.727 --> 26:00.662
- Can you fight?

26:00.697 --> 26:02.630
Mm-mm honey, that's not for you.

26:04.597 --> 26:05.736
That's for real people.

26:05.771 --> 26:07.807
Ex cons are the entertainment.

26:07.842 --> 26:09.153
Next.

26:09.188 --> 26:10.361
- Here at Newtown,

26:10.396 --> 26:12.536
we offer a more
fulfilled existence.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.745
One where you can
realize your dreams

26:14.780 --> 26:16.367
while getting paid.

26:47.157 --> 26:48.710
- According to this,
he's in division 14

26:48.745 --> 26:50.367
but his chip is in division 12.

26:50.401 --> 26:51.851
- Try
the second chip.

26:51.886 --> 26:53.059
- He'd have removed
that as well, wouldn't he?

26:53.094 --> 26:54.336
- If he knew he had it.

26:54.371 --> 26:55.821
- That's not very citizenly.

26:55.855 --> 26:58.513
- We need an NC
unit immediately.

26:58.547 --> 27:02.068
Jones is at the corner of
Mission and Gate heading west.

27:02.931 --> 27:04.553
- Why is he so important to you?

27:06.555 --> 27:07.764
- The audience likes him.

27:09.766 --> 27:11.284
- Right.

27:11.319 --> 27:14.909
- Prisoner
4110787 has been located.

27:16.082 --> 27:18.153
All reported sightings
of Hardin Jones

27:18.188 --> 27:20.708
can qualify for
community action rewards.

27:27.887 --> 27:29.924
Please remain at your location.

27:35.584 --> 27:40.589
- Central control,
we've lost visual.

28:01.749 --> 28:03.854
- Hardin may
be on the loose right now

28:03.889 --> 28:06.236
but in the city where the
online betting community

28:06.270 --> 28:09.204
never sleeps, it's surely
only a matter of time

28:09.239 --> 28:11.724
until odds of his
recapture become pretty.

28:11.759 --> 28:13.761
- Curfew,
this is curfew.

28:15.176 --> 28:16.522
- Intimate details
of Hardin's existence.

28:16.556 --> 28:18.697
Read the books Hardin reads,

28:18.731 --> 28:20.906
download his playlists,
and the films he likes.

28:20.940 --> 28:24.150
Loyalty customers
qualify for felon app

28:24.185 --> 28:27.153
which allows you to adopt
your very own felon.

28:27.188 --> 28:31.537
Watch him 24-7 and even
visit Panopticon TV.

28:31.571 --> 28:33.781
Drama's never been so real.

31:02.930 --> 31:04.483
- The fighting man.

31:06.795 --> 31:09.868
You know what you're
worth right now?

31:59.020 --> 32:00.332
- Hardin.

32:30.327 --> 32:31.363
- Going blonde?

32:32.847 --> 32:33.952
Platinum really.

32:35.401 --> 32:37.127
Think this is gonna get
you past face recognition,

32:37.162 --> 32:41.821
gate recognition, iris scanners,
barcodes, tattoos, chips.

32:44.548 --> 32:45.998
Nielsen, the woman
who runs the jails

32:46.033 --> 32:47.310
is planning on
rolling the system out

32:47.344 --> 32:48.414
to a whole new town.

32:49.864 --> 32:51.452
Officially the prison overflow.

32:52.625 --> 32:55.663
Unofficially, it's the
expansion of Prison TV.

32:55.697 --> 32:57.458
Only more interactive.

32:57.492 --> 32:58.631
You're her prize draw.

33:01.393 --> 33:02.877
People listen to you.

33:02.911 --> 33:05.086
If you told them to stop
working, they would.

33:06.605 --> 33:08.158
If you told them not to tune
in to the town, they would.

33:09.435 --> 33:11.023
You can't hide, Hardin.

33:11.058 --> 33:12.818
You know that much at least.

33:12.852 --> 33:14.613
We gotta go, good luck.

33:24.830 --> 33:27.315
- Curfew, curfew.

33:27.350 --> 33:30.698
- Download his playlist
and the films he likes.

33:30.732 --> 33:32.838
Loyalty customers get
access to the felon app

33:32.872 --> 33:36.462
which allows you to adopt
your very own felon.

33:36.497 --> 33:37.739
Watch him 24-7.

34:02.730 --> 34:04.697
- Hey, it's me, it's Nash.

34:06.665 --> 34:07.769
Hardin.

34:07.804 --> 34:08.908
- Quick, day of birth!

34:09.875 --> 34:11.532
- 7/7/2029.

34:11.565 --> 34:13.396
- Our day of birth!

34:13.429 --> 34:14.742
- 7/7/2019.

34:14.775 --> 34:15.846
- Birthmark.

34:15.880 --> 34:17.020
- Red line inner thigh.

34:18.469 --> 34:19.850
An octopus has three hearts.

34:19.885 --> 34:22.750
A man and a dog are
always faithful.

34:22.784 --> 34:24.648
Then one will come in handy.

34:24.683 --> 34:25.891
Jesus Christ, well you know

34:25.925 --> 34:27.065
if you let me visit you
every once in a while

34:27.099 --> 34:28.618
you might fucking recognize me.

34:30.792 --> 34:32.103
Parker wanted you
up on the screens

34:32.139 --> 34:33.588
instructing the masses.

34:34.934 --> 34:36.487
I wasn't gonna let that happen.

34:36.522 --> 34:38.455
Just went along with
it to get you out.

34:39.594 --> 34:42.114
You ever wonder why
you didn't make parole?

34:42.149 --> 34:43.943
Why you did more
than your 10 years?

34:45.083 --> 34:46.705
These bastards were
never gonna let you out.

34:48.638 --> 34:49.534
So we cut you out.

34:51.158 --> 34:52.193
Right under her nose.

34:54.782 --> 34:56.438
But this, bruv.

34:59.269 --> 35:00.995
I think these will be more use.

35:04.895 --> 35:05.724
They're lenses.

35:06.897 --> 35:07.967
They can get you
past the sensors.

35:09.141 --> 35:10.349
First thing is to lift
those fingerprints,

35:10.384 --> 35:12.558
lose your tattoo,
anything identifiable.

35:19.186 --> 35:21.429
Yeah, you should change
the way you walk too.

35:23.569 --> 35:26.710
But once that's all sorted,
you'll finally be free.

35:26.745 --> 35:28.919
You know, you can
do what you like.

35:35.098 --> 35:37.825
You know there
was a time when I,

35:40.207 --> 35:41.932
I thought you'd
never make it out.

35:45.177 --> 35:46.144
I didn't know what to do.

35:51.873 --> 35:53.081
- They get to me,
they get to you.

35:53.116 --> 35:53.875
- They're not
gonna get to you,

35:53.910 --> 35:55.394
that's what I'm saying.

35:55.429 --> 35:57.120
We can protect you.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.604
- I'm on every screen.

35:58.639 --> 35:59.916
- You'll be safe with us.

36:02.367 --> 36:04.472
We got a lot of catching
up to do, you know?

36:06.992 --> 36:08.580
- What's beyond this city?

36:08.614 --> 36:09.960
- Favela town.

36:09.995 --> 36:12.308
You'll never make it
past the perimeter.

36:12.342 --> 36:13.412
It's where they burn the trash.

36:13.447 --> 36:14.344
- I can't stay here.

36:14.379 --> 36:15.863
- You got no place else to go.

36:29.394 --> 36:31.534
The places with symbols,

36:31.568 --> 36:33.777
that means that
surveillance has been cut.

36:33.812 --> 36:36.608
And follow the hobo
code, lead you to food.

36:36.642 --> 36:37.678
If you get stuck out there,

36:37.712 --> 36:39.783
there's a guy named Perelman.

36:39.818 --> 36:40.922
He's the closest
thing you'll find

36:40.957 --> 36:42.338
to somebody you can trust.

36:42.372 --> 36:44.512
He moves around the
outskirts of Favela town.

36:44.547 --> 36:45.479
Don't fuck up.

37:15.302 --> 37:16.855
- ID, sir.

37:16.889 --> 37:18.374
- Oh dang.

37:18.408 --> 37:21.963
- The RFID chip is
painless and totally free.

37:21.998 --> 37:23.793
Imagine an end to those fines

37:23.827 --> 37:25.277
for forgetting your card.

37:25.312 --> 37:28.038
No more debt and with
less to remember,

37:28.073 --> 37:30.903
you can spend more
time with your.

42:14.635 --> 42:15.498
- Hi.

42:17.569 --> 42:18.605
I'm Mathison.

42:22.988 --> 42:25.543
We're not gonna hurt you.

42:25.577 --> 42:29.167
We just want you to answer
a few questions truthfully.

42:29.201 --> 42:31.341
When you're done, you can go.

42:31.376 --> 42:33.896
Now if you don't answer
these questions truthfully

42:33.930 --> 42:34.862
then you can't go.

42:37.347 --> 42:39.004
Are you Mallory Burnham,

42:39.039 --> 42:43.871
leader of the Central
Authority from 2014 to 2019?

42:45.908 --> 42:47.495
- Yeah.

42:47.530 --> 42:49.463
What, what are you doing?

42:49.497 --> 42:50.844
- Just thought
I'd do some of the questions

42:50.878 --> 42:52.846
from the citizens
that you fucked over.

42:55.055 --> 42:56.574
Don't bother trying to escape.

42:57.678 --> 42:58.817
There's no stairs.

42:58.852 --> 43:00.232
- Jesus Christ.

43:00.267 --> 43:03.822
- Just an elevator
shaft with no elevator.

43:03.857 --> 43:05.134
- I'm hungry.

43:05.168 --> 43:06.100
- Most people can last five days

43:06.135 --> 43:08.171
on just their fatty deposits.

43:08.206 --> 43:10.795
I'll say you're good
for at least two weeks.

43:10.829 --> 43:11.934
- I am swift.

43:13.211 --> 43:15.178
You let me go immediately,

43:15.213 --> 43:17.318
I can make this a whole
lot easier on you.

43:18.837 --> 43:20.011
- It's easy now.

43:20.045 --> 43:21.529
- How many hits?

43:21.564 --> 43:23.911
- Um, it's not about hits
so much as conversions.

43:23.946 --> 43:26.465
- Just give me a number.

43:26.500 --> 43:27.708
- 77 million.

43:27.743 --> 43:29.192
- Take it down, can't
you just take it down?

43:29.227 --> 43:30.642
- It just gets posted again.

43:30.677 --> 43:33.403
- Are we any closer to bringing
these fuckers in or what?

43:33.438 --> 43:35.336
- We've narrowed down
the location of the court

43:35.371 --> 43:37.062
to Division 17 near
district six, and if we--

43:37.097 --> 43:38.892
- Court, this isn't a court.

43:38.926 --> 43:41.135
This is a bunch
of veggie hackers

43:41.170 --> 43:43.448
with a misplaced sense
of their own importance.

43:43.482 --> 43:44.898
- They have
some influence.

43:44.932 --> 43:46.658
- Well, you can call them
influences if you want

43:46.693 --> 43:49.419
but I'm gonna stick to
domestic terrorists.

43:49.454 --> 43:50.835
What more do you guys need?

43:50.869 --> 43:54.597
We have kidnap, vandalism,
robbery, extortion.

43:54.632 --> 43:55.805
- We can't get them on robbery.

43:55.840 --> 43:56.979
They didn't empty the banks.

43:57.013 --> 43:58.636
- No, they only
announced which banks

43:58.670 --> 43:59.844
were going to be emptied.

43:59.878 --> 44:01.639
The customers took
their own money out.

44:01.673 --> 44:02.847
- Plus they're only
collapsing the grid

44:02.881 --> 44:05.090
from 1700 to 1800 hours

44:05.125 --> 44:06.540
so people get to
leave work early

44:06.574 --> 44:08.335
which is proving to
be pretty popular.

44:08.369 --> 44:10.924
- Oh good, well I'm
glad that's popular.

44:10.958 --> 44:14.134
- At a cost of 11
billion wan a day.

44:21.175 --> 44:23.005
- I want every kid
on every building

44:23.039 --> 44:24.731
and anyone with a
mask, a spray can

44:24.765 --> 44:26.905
or a tool belt
under the age of 30,

44:26.940 --> 44:28.700
I want them rounded up
and I want them databased.

44:28.735 --> 44:30.633
And make up a clause
if you have to!

44:34.741 --> 44:36.363
And bring their mothers in too.

47:24.255 --> 47:25.083
- Hey!

47:26.602 --> 47:27.430
Who are you?

47:33.540 --> 47:34.886
Go ahead, I'm not greedy.

47:36.198 --> 47:38.407
- It's big of you, it's
a fucking trash can.

47:43.895 --> 47:44.827
- What's your name?

47:49.211 --> 47:51.696
Make one up, so I don't
have to call you bum.

47:57.529 --> 47:58.358
- Hardin.

47:59.807 --> 48:01.188
- I think I like bum better.

48:04.502 --> 48:05.606
Julius.

48:11.923 --> 48:15.893
One thing I love about
the river, never changes.

48:17.308 --> 48:18.999
Doesn't matter who
fucks you over,

48:20.414 --> 48:21.657
the river stays the same.

48:23.383 --> 48:24.522
I used to be a teacher.

48:25.695 --> 48:28.629
Now, all the kids learn online.

48:30.286 --> 48:31.218
What was your line?

48:33.703 --> 48:34.532
- Advertising.

48:36.396 --> 48:38.432
- Hmm, Hardin your real name?

48:38.467 --> 48:40.055
- Yep.

48:40.089 --> 48:41.401
- You from the orphanages?

48:43.713 --> 48:46.026
Yeah, sounds like
an orphanage name.

48:48.097 --> 48:50.548
There are rules, okay?

48:50.582 --> 48:53.792
No phones, no chips.

48:53.827 --> 48:56.450
Nothing that can pick up GPS.

48:56.485 --> 49:00.938
That means no TVs,
radios or I-anythings.

49:02.974 --> 49:03.837
And no swearing.

49:05.356 --> 49:08.497
Beyond that, I don't
care what you've done

49:08.531 --> 49:09.774
or who you've done it to.

49:10.948 --> 49:14.468
You hurt anyone
here, I'll hurt you.

49:16.125 --> 49:16.954
You got it?

49:18.472 --> 49:19.301
- Got it.

49:25.721 --> 49:26.549
- Everybody.

49:28.413 --> 49:29.518
This is Hardin.

49:31.865 --> 49:33.453
I pulled him out from the trash.

52:09.747 --> 52:11.197
- No doubt you must have noticed

52:11.231 --> 52:13.613
a small flicker of excitement
when you turned up.

52:18.549 --> 52:23.381
We don't get a lot of entertainment
around here, you know.

52:27.074 --> 52:30.147
You know, life expectancy
on this street is 37.

52:36.636 --> 52:39.225
Gotta make the most out of
your time on earth, right?

52:43.194 --> 52:44.091
What do you think?

55:08.960 --> 55:10.583
- Want me to take a watch?

55:12.378 --> 55:13.379
- You?

55:13.413 --> 55:14.276
- Yeah.

55:15.415 --> 55:16.692
- We're watching for you.

55:18.038 --> 55:19.454
It'll get around
that you're here

55:19.488 --> 55:20.834
and then people will come.

55:23.803 --> 55:25.183
So we'll have to move you.

55:26.392 --> 55:28.980
And if more come, we'll
have to move you again.

55:30.637 --> 55:31.638
We'll keep you safe.

55:32.881 --> 55:33.778
You're family now.

55:35.539 --> 55:39.232
But it's best if you
stay out of sight.

55:50.001 --> 55:51.831
- Okay, assuming our
own research is accurate

55:51.865 --> 55:53.626
that over a third of this
country's most successful

55:53.660 --> 55:56.318
businesses pay zero
tax, and 98 percent

55:56.353 --> 55:57.871
have offshore resources,

55:57.906 --> 56:00.460
this figure here is how much tax

56:00.495 --> 56:02.600
is owed at any one time.

56:02.635 --> 56:04.153
The goal is to find
some nut figure

56:04.188 --> 56:05.051
at which they won't--

56:05.085 --> 56:06.742
- 96.7 percent?

56:08.157 --> 56:09.089
The Laffer curve.

56:09.124 --> 56:10.090
- How'd you know about that?

56:10.125 --> 56:11.402
- Because when I was your age,

56:11.437 --> 56:12.576
you were being born.

56:14.750 --> 56:16.234
He has a point.

56:16.269 --> 56:18.340
- Okay, don't tell
me you're actually thinking

56:18.375 --> 56:19.548
of listening to them.

56:19.583 --> 56:20.998
That would be political suicide.

56:21.032 --> 56:24.622
- These kids
are 15, 16, 22 tops.

56:24.657 --> 56:26.797
We were born in
the last century.

56:26.831 --> 56:28.592
We don't have a hope
of thinking like them.

56:28.626 --> 56:30.352
- Are
you smoking weed?

56:31.733 --> 56:34.080
- All I'm saying
is they're not idiots.

56:34.114 --> 56:37.014
- And
neither I hope, are we.

56:50.061 --> 56:51.511
- Prisoner Barca, sir.

57:02.626 --> 57:05.076
- So you read our manifesto.

57:05.111 --> 57:07.251
- My people did.

57:07.285 --> 57:09.633
They said the spelling
was atrocious.

57:11.738 --> 57:15.293
- Well it was about
communication, not education.

57:17.054 --> 57:18.400
We were communicating.

57:20.644 --> 57:25.096
So I'm sure your people
report on your ratings.

57:29.929 --> 57:30.826
You know what Newtown is?

57:32.759 --> 57:35.210
See Nielsen puts a
chip that controls

57:35.244 --> 57:37.695
your electronical
impulses off your brain.

57:41.596 --> 57:42.631
Maybe you have one.

57:44.495 --> 57:45.669
Maybe that's why you go along

57:45.703 --> 57:48.395
with everything she suggests.

57:51.571 --> 57:52.503
Or maybe you're just fucking--

57:52.538 --> 57:54.401
- There can't just be anarchy.

57:54.436 --> 57:56.783
- And it can't just
be social control.

58:00.131 --> 58:01.512
I mean where is it gonna stop?

58:06.137 --> 58:09.002
You can keep rounding us up

58:09.037 --> 58:11.488
but we'll keep coming
out of the woodwork.

58:14.042 --> 58:16.769
'Cause we've got
nothing to lose.

58:22.291 --> 58:23.776
We are the future.

59:14.412 --> 59:15.448
- Any luck?

59:15.482 --> 59:16.311
- No.

59:18.347 --> 59:20.591
He'll have changed
his appearance by now.

59:20.626 --> 59:22.041
The amount of fights he's had,

59:22.075 --> 59:25.423
he'd easily have reset
his nose, his cheekbones.

59:26.597 --> 59:29.255
Face checkers won't
find him that easily.

59:29.289 --> 59:32.430
And maybe he's been used enough.

59:34.467 --> 59:35.295
- Meaning?

59:36.780 --> 59:38.885
- Maybe he's entitled
to a bit of R and R.

59:40.922 --> 59:42.855
- And who do you think
is going to tune in

59:42.889 --> 59:45.858
to Newtown if Hardin
Jones fails to show?

59:47.653 --> 59:49.896
What do you think
I'm doing this for?

59:49.931 --> 59:52.312
Because I like watching felons?

59:52.347 --> 59:53.451
- Some felons.

59:53.486 --> 59:56.006
- George, we're
overrun with criminals.

59:56.040 --> 59:59.147
Someone has to take
responsibility, I did.

59:59.181 --> 01:00:01.045
I found a way to fund the jails

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.875
and the voters like that.

01:00:02.909 --> 01:00:07.155
- I'm just saying, maybe
he doesn't want that.

01:00:07.189 --> 01:00:09.364
- What do you know
about what he wants?

01:00:09.398 --> 01:00:10.952
- I don't.

01:00:10.986 --> 01:00:12.781
But how do you think
he's gonna feel

01:00:12.816 --> 01:00:14.265
when he finds out what
you've done to him?

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:16.371
- He killed someone.

01:00:16.405 --> 01:00:17.993
- Someone who
attacked his brother.

01:00:18.028 --> 01:00:20.858
- Did he get the
death penalty, no.

01:00:20.893 --> 01:00:22.826
He got famous.

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:24.413
- Right.

01:00:24.448 --> 01:00:26.484
So maybe you could do
it to someone else.

01:00:27.831 --> 01:00:29.695
- Now that's a good idea.

01:00:35.701 --> 01:00:36.978
- Nash,
what kind of things

01:00:37.012 --> 01:00:38.876
can a felon expect
here in Newtown?

01:00:38.911 --> 01:00:40.188
- Give you money.

01:00:40.222 --> 01:00:41.016
- They give
you a house, right?

01:00:41.051 --> 01:00:42.431
- Play in the casino.

01:00:42.466 --> 01:00:44.364
- Oh my god,
I should commit a crime.

01:00:44.399 --> 01:00:46.366
- I want a car.

01:00:46.401 --> 01:00:47.574
- You've
become a big star

01:00:47.609 --> 01:00:49.300
like your brother Hardin.

01:00:49.335 --> 01:00:50.681
How does that make you feel?

01:00:53.719 --> 01:00:55.652
- Nash Jones,

01:00:55.686 --> 01:00:57.999

01:05:21.262 --> 01:05:22.953
are those that
committed a crime.

01:05:22.988 --> 01:05:26.957
The rest of us
incarcerate ourselves.

01:05:26.992 --> 01:05:28.648
In marriage, nine to five jobs,

01:05:28.683 --> 01:05:30.892
organized religion,
loyalty cards.

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:32.894
Do you think they would
have had to comb the deserts

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:36.691
for Terrorist 47 if
he had a loyalty card?

01:05:36.725 --> 01:05:39.901
Do you
know what this is?

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:44.147
Fresh, no additives,
no artificial sun,

01:05:44.181 --> 01:05:47.357
you can't buy these in
the city or the suburb.

01:05:48.185 --> 01:05:52.258
Well, I must say,

01:05:52.293 --> 01:05:53.984
sure is nice to
have some company.

01:05:55.123 --> 01:05:56.814
Even somebody as
monosyllabic as you.

01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:00.370
- Where's my brother?

01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:07.584
- Nash won at the
casino, bought a car.

01:06:07.618 --> 01:06:08.965
Passes all around.

01:06:10.690 --> 01:06:11.933
- Passes?

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:13.176
- He's got to pass
a series of tests

01:06:13.210 --> 01:06:14.867
in order to re-enter society.

01:06:14.901 --> 01:06:16.179
- What kind of tests?

01:06:16.213 --> 01:06:17.801
- Standard stuff.

01:06:17.835 --> 01:06:19.734
Will he take the money,
will he steal the car,

01:06:19.768 --> 01:06:21.287
will he rape the girl?

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.257
Will he rape the girl?

01:06:25.291 --> 01:06:26.085
- No.

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:28.225
- Then he'll fail.

01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:30.952
In order to pass, you have
to conform to the will

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:32.126
of the group.

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.404
Conformists are
easiest to control.

01:06:36.509 --> 01:06:38.166
Nash has a chip in his throat.

01:06:39.547 --> 01:06:41.031
- How are you
getting me in there?

01:06:41.066 --> 01:06:43.206
- If you go into Newtown,
the subscribers will follow.

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.966
Consumerism will
go through the roof

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:46.933
and Nielsen will get
the hit that she needs.

01:06:46.968 --> 01:06:48.176
- So?

01:06:48.211 --> 01:06:50.316
- So you have to be sure
you care more about Nash

01:06:50.351 --> 01:06:52.974
than you do your
newfound anonymity.

01:06:54.182 --> 01:06:55.804
- How long you been watching me?

01:06:57.530 --> 01:06:59.429
- Since I needed you.

01:06:59.463 --> 01:07:01.189
- Needed me for what?

01:07:01.224 --> 01:07:03.674
- To bring down Newtown.

01:07:03.709 --> 01:07:04.986
If Newtown's a success,

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:06.643
Nielsen will roll
it out even bigger.

01:07:06.677 --> 01:07:08.127
The whole city maybe.

01:07:08.162 --> 01:07:13.132
10 million cameras, 20 million
consumers, all trackable.

01:07:14.202 --> 01:07:16.998
And eventually, controllable.

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:21.692
Panopticon3, interactive,
just hit return.

01:07:32.186 --> 01:07:35.051
Society forgives a
criminal, never a dreamer.

01:07:36.224 --> 01:07:38.537
That's what happens when
you take on the system.

01:07:45.682 --> 01:07:46.890
- You built this.

01:07:49.341 --> 01:07:51.860
- I built Newtown
for rehabilitation.

01:07:51.895 --> 01:07:53.966
Nielsen has turned it
into something else.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.864
- Where can I find her?

01:07:55.899 --> 01:07:57.245
- Should be in a
bunker somewhere.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.384
The bunker might be underground

01:07:58.419 --> 01:07:59.799
but it can be
spotted from the air.

01:07:59.834 --> 01:08:01.353
Even she can't hide.

01:08:01.387 --> 01:08:03.148
The town must destroy itself.

01:08:03.182 --> 01:08:05.702
The attraction that
is you need to be seen

01:08:05.736 --> 01:08:06.806
to be eliminated.

01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:09.637
Do you want your anonymity back?

01:08:11.570 --> 01:08:14.297
Come on, that's gotta
be worth dying for.

01:08:18.439 --> 01:08:19.267
Map.

01:08:21.372 --> 01:08:22.443
Card for the door.

01:08:23.892 --> 01:08:25.687
And you know what the
rest of the stuff is.

01:08:25.721 --> 01:08:26.895
Nash is on the run.

01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:28.689
First place he'll come
to will be a motel

01:08:28.725 --> 01:08:29.553
at the edge of the town.

01:08:29.587 --> 01:08:31.037
Will he stop?

01:08:31.072 --> 01:08:32.037
- They don't
want him to stop.

01:08:32.073 --> 01:08:32.867
- Now
then he'll stop.

01:08:32.901 --> 01:08:33.799
- Here's a stop.

01:08:33.832 --> 01:08:35.249
- How do you know that?

01:08:35.283 --> 01:08:36.733
- Because they
need you to catch up with him.

01:08:36.767 --> 01:08:38.183
- Pick him
up in the casino then.

01:08:38.216 --> 01:08:39.529
- You're a criminal.

01:08:40.667 --> 01:08:41.841
Steal a car.

01:08:59.203 --> 01:09:00.895
- Nash Jones,
brother of Hardin,

01:09:00.929 --> 01:09:03.966
robbed a gas station and
allegedly kidnapped a girl.

01:09:04.001 --> 01:09:07.212
All verified sightings
posted to Newtown.org

01:09:07.246 --> 01:09:10.145
will qualify for
community action reward.

01:09:31.546 --> 01:09:33.203
- Gentleman sir.

01:09:33.238 --> 01:09:34.066
Hey!

01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:39.269
- Tried to
drive their way through.

01:10:39.304 --> 01:10:43.446
And the crowd and then
triggered enormous panic here.

01:11:01.015 --> 01:11:04.294
- Our demands were fair
and still you fail.

01:11:06.089 --> 01:11:08.850
You thought you could close
Panopticon and open Newtown.

01:11:21.173 --> 01:11:22.243
- Panopticon
II Interactive

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:24.210
takes you right into Newtown

01:11:24.245 --> 01:11:27.766
where you can interact
with

01:11:28.974 --> 01:11:30.838
- Is it just
back to the base, sir?

01:11:32.011 --> 01:11:34.013
- Take
me to Favela town.

01:11:34.048 --> 01:11:34.876
- Sir?

01:11:36.153 --> 01:11:37.293
- You know where it is?

01:11:38.708 --> 01:11:40.537
- We can't go
there, sir, I mean,

01:11:40.572 --> 01:11:43.368
they'll take the
wheels, the car.

01:11:44.507 --> 01:11:46.405
We might not even make
it back ourselves.

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:47.648
- Fine.

01:11:47.682 --> 01:11:48.925
I'll drive myself.

01:12:24.685 --> 01:12:26.065
- Where the hell have you been?

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:28.896
We haven't been able
to reach you for hours!

01:12:28.930 --> 01:12:32.209
I mean you need to inform
us where you're going.

01:12:32.244 --> 01:12:33.728
In case you hadn't
noticed, this place

01:12:33.763 --> 01:12:35.420
has been going tits up.

01:12:35.454 --> 01:12:37.801
We've got to give
them something.

01:12:39.424 --> 01:12:42.668
I've got 200 people
working 24-7 on the grid.

01:12:42.703 --> 01:12:44.429
Every time we get it up,

01:12:44.463 --> 01:12:47.259
it's up for 30 minutes
and then it gets hacked.

01:12:47.293 --> 01:12:50.055
So I say what we need
to do is if you have

01:12:50.089 --> 01:12:51.919
to turn the lights on.

01:13:06.761 --> 01:13:09.799
- What are we gonna do?

01:13:09.833 --> 01:13:11.248
We've got citizens
living in trash cans

01:13:11.283 --> 01:13:13.319
on toxic dumps,

01:13:13.354 --> 01:13:15.183
bums being zapped by drones,

01:13:15.218 --> 01:13:17.393
organs ordered online,

01:13:19.947 --> 01:13:22.328
I'm the
leader of the free world

01:13:23.502 --> 01:13:25.228
and the only thing I
have any control over

01:13:25.262 --> 01:13:26.954
is what I'm gonna
have for dinner.

01:13:44.489 --> 01:13:45.524
- You
want anything, George?

01:13:45.559 --> 01:13:47.423
- A girlfriend.

01:13:47.457 --> 01:13:48.631
- Why?

01:13:48.665 --> 01:13:49.770
You wouldn't know
what to do with her.

01:13:52.358 --> 01:13:53.774
How dare you.

01:13:53.808 --> 01:13:56.535
- Terrible, isn't it, when your
personal space gets defiled?

01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:59.469
Sorry about that Nielsen, can't
be too careful these days.

01:13:59.504 --> 01:14:02.230
A lot of enemies out there.

01:14:02.265 --> 01:14:03.300
Most of them mine.

01:14:04.888 --> 01:14:09.065
So, how many people
are watching right now?

01:14:09.099 --> 01:14:10.446
- 17 million.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.964
- Oh, is that good?

01:14:13.345 --> 01:14:15.347
- Not quite a
cause to celebrate.

01:14:15.381 --> 01:14:16.831
- Do I look like I
want to celebrate?

01:14:16.866 --> 01:14:20.594
Only I don't remember signing
up for X-fucking-con Factor.

01:14:22.768 --> 01:14:25.391
This thing have behavioral
recognition on it?

01:14:25.426 --> 01:14:26.910
- Of course it does.

01:14:26.945 --> 01:14:27.980
- So it will pick
someone up talking directly

01:14:28.015 --> 01:14:29.257
to a camera?

01:14:29.292 --> 01:14:29.982
- They don't know
they're on camera.

01:14:30.017 --> 01:14:30.845
- No?

01:14:38.094 --> 01:14:40.406
- Taxes will be
reduced from 60 percent

01:14:40.441 --> 01:14:41.822
to 20 percent.

01:14:41.856 --> 01:14:43.340
- They're
not gonna listen to him.

01:14:43.375 --> 01:14:47.344
- Hardin's cute younger
brother recruiting online?

01:14:47.379 --> 01:14:48.829
You don't think so?

01:14:48.863 --> 01:14:50.451
- I have insurance.

01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:55.801
- You fitted him
with a control chip?

01:14:55.836 --> 01:14:58.045
- People died
building the pyramids.

01:14:58.079 --> 01:14:59.529
It's the price of progress.

01:14:59.564 --> 01:15:02.152
- This has to stop.

01:15:02.187 --> 01:15:03.015
- Or what?

01:15:04.465 --> 01:15:06.743
I've got more on you than
you'll ever have on me.

01:15:06.778 --> 01:15:09.574
- Oh, I really hope that
that wasn't a threat.

01:15:09.608 --> 01:15:10.851
What happened?

01:15:10.885 --> 01:15:12.680
- There are no
cameras in the bathroom.

01:15:50.856 --> 01:15:51.650
- You feel it?

01:15:51.685 --> 01:15:52.962
- Fine.
- Yeah?

01:15:52.996 --> 01:15:53.790
- Yeah, just do it.

01:15:53.825 --> 01:15:55.654
- Here we go.

01:15:56.897 --> 01:15:58.623
- Ah, god, you make
a shitty surgeon.

01:15:58.657 --> 01:16:00.141
- You make a shitty patient.

01:16:01.487 --> 01:16:02.281
Shit.

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:04.767
- Cut
the transmission.

01:16:04.801 --> 01:16:06.251
- It's already on the cloud.

01:16:06.285 --> 01:16:07.528
We can't cut the signal.

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:09.495
- Okay, okay, okay,
move your hand.

01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:10.324
Move your hand.

01:16:10.358 --> 01:16:11.705
Nash, Nash.

01:16:12.706 --> 01:16:14.328
Move your hand, move your hand!

01:16:14.362 --> 01:16:15.950
Jesus.

01:16:15.985 --> 01:16:18.125
Hey, stay with me, stay with me.

01:16:18.159 --> 01:16:20.817
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:16:20.852 --> 01:16:21.991
Hey!

01:16:22.025 --> 01:16:27.030
Nash!

01:16:27.272 --> 01:16:27.928
Nash!

01:16:32.415 --> 01:16:33.243
Hey, hey.

01:16:45.359 --> 01:16:47.085
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:18:19.729 --> 01:18:23.319
- Security
breach, security breach,

01:18:23.353 --> 01:18:26.667
security breach, security breach

01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:29.428
security breach,
security breach.

01:20:01.831 --> 01:20:03.971
- Code accepted.

01:20:07.906 --> 01:20:10.460
- Episode three
is now ready to stream.

01:20:11.565 --> 01:20:13.498
- Hardin
Jones escaped.

01:20:13.532 --> 01:20:16.052
Hardin found love,
but will it last?

01:20:16.087 --> 01:20:18.296
Maybe he'll join his
brother Nash in Newtown,

01:20:18.330 --> 01:20:21.057
play at the casinos,
win the cool car.

01:20:21.092 --> 01:20:24.198
Meet beautiful girls,
you can help him decide

01:20:24.233 --> 01:20:26.580
and one day, the
choice will be yours.

01:20:27.753 --> 01:20:30.998
Panopticon TV, drama's
never been so real.

01:21:14.007 --> 01:21:14.904
- Hardin.

01:21:17.010 --> 01:21:19.771
There's no way I would
ever have hurt you

01:21:19.805 --> 01:21:21.290
or your brother.

01:21:21.324 --> 01:21:24.258
I was trying to
improve things for you.

01:21:24.293 --> 01:21:26.882
Newtown would have
given you a way out,

01:21:26.916 --> 01:21:29.367
give you back your
freedom for good.

01:21:29.401 --> 01:21:33.612
It was the advertisers that
didn't want to let you go.

01:21:33.647 --> 01:21:35.407
Because you're different.

01:21:35.442 --> 01:21:37.789
Why do you think
everyone tuned in,

01:21:37.823 --> 01:21:38.997
it was because of you.

01:21:41.103 --> 01:21:42.794
I'm only trying to
make things better

01:21:42.828 --> 01:21:44.520
for people who have nothing.

01:21:45.486 --> 01:21:49.421
People like you, me and Nash.

01:21:49.456 --> 01:21:50.733
What hope have they got?

01:21:53.943 --> 01:21:58.637
And you, you never have
to worry about money.

01:21:58.672 --> 01:21:59.604
That's freedom.

01:22:01.399 --> 01:22:02.745
I gave you that.

01:22:04.954 --> 01:22:07.163
- You gave me that?

01:22:07.198 --> 01:22:09.096
- I made you a star.

01:22:10.477 --> 01:22:11.996
Isn't that what everyone wants?

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.935
We could make a great
difference together, you and me.

01:22:19.969 --> 01:22:21.867
We could make a great team.

01:22:24.008 --> 01:22:25.699
We're not that
dissimilar, are we?

01:22:28.184 --> 01:22:30.566
- We couldn't be any more
different, you and I.

01:22:35.847 --> 01:22:38.574
Do you know what it is
to really love someone,

01:22:38.608 --> 01:22:39.644
someone you'd kill for,

01:22:39.678 --> 01:22:41.266
someone to go on living for?

01:22:43.303 --> 01:22:45.236
- Yes I do.

01:22:55.625 --> 01:22:57.144
You can have anything you want.

01:23:23.205 --> 01:23:27.692
- Hmm.

01:24:39.108 --> 01:24:42.318
- Thanks for
waking up with us.

01:24:48.186 --> 01:24:50.775
- Don't walk, don't walk.

01:25:07.757 --> 01:25:09.276
- Though there were no
witnesses to the accident,

01:25:09.311 --> 01:25:10.933
train cam found a wrecked car

01:25:10.967 --> 01:25:12.831
believed to be the one
stolen from Newtown

01:25:12.866 --> 01:25:14.557
crashing over the
side of a goods train

01:25:14.592 --> 01:25:17.836
carrying electronic
equipment to the city.

01:25:17.871 --> 01:25:19.838
Desert police continue
to search for debris

01:25:19.873 --> 01:25:21.599
scattered across the desert.

01:25:21.633 --> 01:25:24.153
At this time it is
unknown if any body

01:25:24.188 --> 01:25:25.292
has been identified.

01:25:26.362 --> 01:25:27.708
Following the
success of Prison TV,

01:25:27.743 --> 01:25:30.746
Jones became the world's
most downloaded felon

01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:33.749
used to advertise anything
from t-shirts to jeans.

01:25:33.783 --> 01:25:36.752
It's estimated his loss
could cost the prison service

01:25:36.786 --> 01:25:38.443
as much as 15 trillion.

01:25:38.478 --> 01:25:40.963
- Any chance of
putting her in jail?

01:25:40.997 --> 01:25:42.551
- They'd
rip her to pieces.

01:25:42.585 --> 01:25:43.931
- Christmas special.

01:25:49.558 --> 01:25:50.524
- You want a drink?

01:25:50.559 --> 01:25:52.699
- Ah, rain check.

01:25:52.733 --> 01:25:55.322
My son's gotten
himself into the finals

01:25:55.357 --> 01:25:57.566
of some video game championship

01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.395
and tonight's my night, so.

01:26:00.293 --> 01:26:01.328
- I hope he wins.

01:26:01.363 --> 01:26:03.503
- He always wins.

01:26:03.537 --> 01:26:04.745
See you on Monday?

01:26:44.854 --> 01:26:47.512
