WEBVTT

00:03.063 --> 00:04.964
Oh.
Oh, boy. Look at that.

00:05.032 --> 00:06.432
- You know, this-- this--
- Yeah, it's--

00:06.500 --> 00:07.733
You know, "tax the rich." Yeah.

00:07.801 --> 00:09.868
Oh, yeah.

00:09.936 --> 00:11.737
This world.

00:11.805 --> 00:14.607
Do <i>not</i> get me started.

00:14.675 --> 00:17.810
Hey, guys, guys, look.
That coyote's in the yard again.

00:17.877 --> 00:18.877
Really?
Yeah.

00:18.945 --> 00:19.845
Oh, cool!

00:21.114 --> 00:22.214
Oh!

00:22.282 --> 00:23.848
Dad, he looks hungry.

00:23.916 --> 00:26.351
That's 'cause he hasn't
caught the road runner yet.

00:27.853 --> 00:29.688
Can we feed him?
Oh...

00:29.755 --> 00:32.223
No, we can't feed him.
You don't feed wild animals.

00:32.290 --> 00:34.326
Yeah, your dad's right.

00:34.393 --> 00:36.494
Could be dangerous.

00:36.562 --> 00:39.496
Oh, but look.
He's all alone out there.

00:39.564 --> 00:41.131
- Honey!
- Can't we just give him a bowl of milk?

00:41.199 --> 00:43.166
- Just a little--
- No! How about getting a bowl of milk,

00:43.234 --> 00:45.268
Put some cereal in it, and bring
it back to dad here? How about--

00:47.472 --> 00:49.272
Coyote's leaving.

00:49.341 --> 00:50.874
Wait. Coyote?

00:50.942 --> 00:52.743
Oh, my God! Has anybody seen the dog?
Muffin!

00:52.811 --> 00:54.744
Muffin!

00:54.812 --> 00:56.912
- Dad? What if that coyote got Muffin?
- Huh?

00:56.980 --> 00:59.449
The coyote did not get Muffin.
Well, how do you know?

00:59.516 --> 01:02.918
Because there would be bits of Muffin out there.

01:02.986 --> 01:05.221
- Mom.
- Oh, honey, that isn't reassuring.

01:05.288 --> 01:07.457
But it paints a picture, doesn't it?

01:07.524 --> 01:09.826
Everybody! I have news.

01:09.893 --> 01:12.694
Terrence and I are celebrating
our one-month anniversary.

01:12.762 --> 01:15.163
- Of what?
- Of <i>love,</i> that's what!

01:15.231 --> 01:17.031
No, no, no. No. No, no, no.
Mandy, nobody likes the song!

01:17.099 --> 01:18.767
Nobody wants to hear the song!

01:18.835 --> 01:20.569
♪ there was a girl, she met a boy ♪

01:20.636 --> 01:23.004
♪ on Facebook ♪

01:23.072 --> 01:25.540
♪ her profile pic blew him away, oh ♪

01:25.608 --> 01:27.441
Someone hit "mute"!

01:29.268 --> 01:32.346
Wow, a month.
That's 30 days in a row.

01:32.414 --> 01:33.280
I know!
Yeah.

01:33.348 --> 01:35.315
I really like him!

01:35.384 --> 01:37.951
- He's smart and sophisticated, and he's <i>so</i> into me.
- Mm.

01:38.019 --> 01:40.755
He says I remind him that life
doesn't have to be complicated.

01:45.426 --> 01:47.560
When-- when do we get to meet this boy?

01:47.628 --> 01:49.462
Yeah, how about never?
Dad wouldn't like him.

01:49.530 --> 01:51.063
Oh, of course not.
Dad doesn't like

01:51.131 --> 01:52.699
Any of our boyfriends.
He likes <i>your</i> boyfriend.

01:52.767 --> 01:54.066
Yeah, that's because he's my boyfriend's boss,

01:54.134 --> 01:56.035
And he enjoys that control.

01:56.103 --> 01:58.906
No, I think it's because he has
a fear of being replaced.

01:59.006 --> 02:00.338
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

02:00.407 --> 02:02.073
It's because he likes being our rescuer,

02:02.141 --> 02:03.709
And when there are other men in the picture,

02:03.777 --> 02:05.310
That role is threatened.

02:05.378 --> 02:06.745
But-- but I think he also feels guilty

02:06.813 --> 02:08.380
About how he was away so much.

02:08.448 --> 02:10.048
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Plus he doesn't want

02:10.116 --> 02:12.651
- To have to pay for <i>three</i> weddings.
- Mm-hmm.

02:15.307 --> 02:17.857

02:26.398 --> 02:28.999
Wow. Where did this guy come from?

02:29.067 --> 02:30.301
He was hanging around the dumpster,

02:30.368 --> 02:33.136
So I gave him three warnings and then, pow!

02:33.203 --> 02:36.239
Mike snagged him from a private collection.

02:36.307 --> 02:38.942
This grizzly was bagged
by Teddy Roosevelt himself.

02:39.009 --> 02:41.645
He was a great hunter and a big nature lover.

02:41.712 --> 02:43.212
Yeah. Look at him.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.549
Look at him-- fierce and powerful.

02:45.616 --> 02:47.683
I think I'll call him Ed.

02:49.052 --> 02:51.353
You already named the snow leopard Ed.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.688
Yeah, well, it's my store.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.523
I can call the track lighting Ed if I want.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.860
You guys do whatever you want,

02:57.928 --> 03:00.395
- But this is a great piece of American history.
- Yeah.

03:00.464 --> 03:02.064
Um, Mr. Alzate?
Yeah?

03:02.131 --> 03:03.531
Speaking of history, just for fun,

03:03.599 --> 03:05.567
I signed up with one of those online companies

03:05.634 --> 03:07.602
That look up who your ancestors are,

03:07.670 --> 03:09.737
- And--
- Uh, just for fun, I'm walking away.

03:09.805 --> 03:13.508
No, wait. It turns out I'm Basque, like you.

03:13.576 --> 03:15.577
I mean, my ancestors.

03:17.279 --> 03:18.579
Are you sure?

03:18.646 --> 03:22.082
Yeah. A small region between France and Spain.

03:22.149 --> 03:24.751
Weird language.
History of persecution.

03:24.819 --> 03:26.219
Mm-hmm. That's us!

03:27.789 --> 03:29.322
That's us!
How about that?

03:29.390 --> 03:32.425
My little Basque brother.
Come here.

03:34.828 --> 03:37.029
I always knew there was something noble about you.

03:37.097 --> 03:39.431
And yet you never spoke up.
Yeah.

03:40.901 --> 03:42.768
I have so much to teach you.

03:42.836 --> 03:44.470
Like what?

03:44.538 --> 03:47.607
To begin with, my family's secret salt cod recipe.

03:47.674 --> 03:49.074
What's the secret?

03:49.142 --> 03:51.042
It's chicken.

03:51.110 --> 03:54.746
Come on.

04:00.352 --> 04:01.319
Hey, honey.
Hi.

04:01.387 --> 04:02.654
You waiting for Terrence?

04:02.722 --> 04:04.589
Uh, yeah. And if he doesn't get here soon,

04:04.657 --> 04:08.125
Dad will be home, and they'll have to interact.

04:08.192 --> 04:10.628
Well, sweetie, we gotta meet
this boy at some point.

04:10.695 --> 04:11.929
I don't see why.

04:13.732 --> 04:15.399
Hey, I told you to honk.
Never mind. Let's go.

04:15.466 --> 04:17.434
Hey, wait, wait.

04:17.502 --> 04:18.903
How about an introduction?

04:18.970 --> 04:20.337
- Oh. Mom, Terrence. Terrence, mom.
- Hey.

04:20.404 --> 04:21.605
Hi.
Okay.

04:21.673 --> 04:22.839
Hey, who's blocking the driveway?!

04:22.907 --> 04:24.974
Are you happy now?!

04:27.511 --> 04:29.045
Wow. Somebody parked a hybrid out there.

04:29.112 --> 04:32.214
I don't want the neighbors to see that thing.

04:32.282 --> 04:35.384
Oh, that's, uh-- that's mine,
sir. Hi. I'm Terrence.

04:35.452 --> 04:37.319
Hi. Mike Baxter.
Could you move your car

04:37.387 --> 04:39.354
- So I can pull the truck in?
- Yeah. We were just leaving, anyway. Bye!

04:39.422 --> 04:41.322
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Mandy, Mandy, wait. How come you're acting so crazy?

04:41.390 --> 04:43.692
Come on. Take a few seconds.
Let's chat.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.260
You're always rushing off to God-knows-where

04:45.327 --> 04:46.595
Doing God-knows-what.

04:46.663 --> 04:49.197
I want to get a chance to look at God-knows-who.

04:50.867 --> 04:53.368
Hey, that's, uh-- that's quite the gun collection

04:53.436 --> 04:55.269
You have back there, Mr. Baxter.

04:55.336 --> 04:56.671
You ought to see the gun collection

04:56.738 --> 04:58.172
We got at outdoor man.

04:58.239 --> 05:01.809
Ah, outdoor man. Yeah, yeah, I-I don't think so.

05:01.877 --> 05:04.144
No offense. I'm just not really into promoting

05:04.212 --> 05:06.647
The slaughter of innocent animals.

05:06.715 --> 05:09.383
Wow.

05:09.451 --> 05:10.984
Your ass just hit the couch, and you're already

05:11.052 --> 05:13.352
Well on your way to making
a good first impression.

05:14.789 --> 05:17.256
I'm-- I'm just being honest with you.

05:17.324 --> 05:18.758
I'm assuming that you like honesty.

05:18.826 --> 05:21.061
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm
just kidding around with you.

05:21.128 --> 05:22.596
Dad, Terrence is a freshman at D.U.

05:22.663 --> 05:24.064
Oh.
Great.

05:24.131 --> 05:25.732
And he's very well-read.
Oh, and he also plays the piano,

05:25.800 --> 05:28.968
But not in that, like, coldplay way that you hate.

05:29.035 --> 05:31.436
- You tickle the ivories.
- Yeah.

05:31.504 --> 05:32.838
You know where ivory comes from?

05:32.906 --> 05:34.073
Dad.

05:37.143 --> 05:38.978
Just kidding.
I'm just kidding around.

05:39.045 --> 05:40.679
So I take it you're not much of a sportsman.

05:40.747 --> 05:42.280
Oh, by sportsman,

05:42.348 --> 05:44.849
Do you mean the assassins who go up in helicopters

05:44.917 --> 05:47.218
With assault rifles and kill wolves?

05:49.187 --> 05:51.055
Well, I'll tell you what, Mandy.

05:51.123 --> 05:52.857
I think you got a live one here.

05:54.727 --> 05:57.228
Honey, just be-- be nice.

05:57.295 --> 05:59.062
I'm being nice, you know.
Listen, Terry,

05:59.130 --> 06:00.797
I just want to explain--

06:00.865 --> 06:03.166
Um, actually, I... Prefer Terrence.

06:04.769 --> 06:07.203
Listen, Terrence, nobody likes
animals more than hunters.

06:07.271 --> 06:09.740
We like to manage a good animal population

06:09.807 --> 06:14.310
So for future generations there's stuff to kill.

06:14.378 --> 06:16.712
All right, uh, just so you know,

06:16.780 --> 06:19.581
I actually belong to an animal rights group.

06:19.650 --> 06:20.616
- Ooh.
- Okay.

06:20.684 --> 06:22.752
Shockeroo.

06:22.819 --> 06:24.954
Which is the name of a little taser

06:25.022 --> 06:27.156
We sell at work to actually bring down kangaroo.

06:27.223 --> 06:29.358
(Mandy) Dad...

06:34.130 --> 06:37.666
Dad, Terrence's group is called P.H.A.R.T.

06:37.733 --> 06:41.136
It's people helping animal rights today.

06:45.274 --> 06:48.942
Yeah. "Phart."

06:49.010 --> 06:52.680
No, no.
It's pronounced "part."

06:52.747 --> 06:55.348
The-- the "h" is silent.

06:55.416 --> 06:57.651
But deadly.
Deadly.

06:59.554 --> 07:01.689
"Puh"!

07:01.756 --> 07:03.056
Thanks.
Mom.

07:03.123 --> 07:06.458
I-- yeah, right. No, so--
so, uh-- so, Terrence, um,

07:06.526 --> 07:08.494
What, uh...
What's your major?

07:08.562 --> 07:09.862
Environmental studies.
Oh.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.764
That's my area.
I'm a geologist.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.100
- Oh, well, a geologist. Right. Oh.
- Yeah.

07:14.168 --> 07:16.736
Yeah, you're the geniuses who invented fracking,

07:16.804 --> 07:20.706
The single greatest threat
to our clean water supply.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.941
Um...

07:23.009 --> 07:24.542
Well, that's not really my department,

07:24.610 --> 07:27.345
- But, um, we-- we do need new sources of energy...
- Yeah.

07:27.413 --> 07:28.947
And, uh, someone's gotta find them

07:29.015 --> 07:30.682
Instead of sleeping till 11:00

07:30.750 --> 07:32.650
- And drinking lattes on the quad!
- Mom!

07:34.720 --> 07:36.721
- Excuse me. Good cop, please.
- No, no, no. Hey.

07:36.788 --> 07:38.723
- It's okay. I'm-- I'm sorry, Mandy...
- No.

07:38.790 --> 07:40.791
But, you know, I-I can't stay here in a house

07:40.859 --> 07:42.993
- Built on bullets and oil barrels.
- No, no, no--

07:43.061 --> 07:44.628
Calm down a little bit.
It's not built on that.

07:44.696 --> 07:47.764
We-- it's a lot of brick,
uh, baby seals, spotted owls.

07:47.832 --> 07:50.767
That's...
Dad!

07:50.835 --> 07:52.703
Would you please quit making fun of him?!

07:52.770 --> 07:55.639
Honey, he's-- he <i>is</i> being
a little confrontational.

07:55.707 --> 07:58.208
- You married him!
- No, I'm talking about your boyfriend.

07:58.276 --> 08:00.776
I am lucky to even have a boyfriend,

08:00.844 --> 08:02.211
Because every time I bring one home,

08:02.279 --> 08:04.647
You can't keep your facts or opinions to yourself!

08:04.715 --> 08:06.549
My opinions <i>are</i> facts.
No!

08:06.617 --> 08:08.718
Dad, what ever happened to "nice to meet you.

08:08.785 --> 08:09.985
Go have fun.
Here's some money"?

08:10.053 --> 08:11.587
Whatever. We're leaving.

08:11.655 --> 08:13.256
And I will be back when I feel like it,

08:13.323 --> 08:14.490
<i>If</i> I feel like it.

08:14.558 --> 08:16.058
Your curfew is at 11:00.

08:16.126 --> 08:18.426
Then I will see you at 11:00!

08:22.265 --> 08:24.932
I like him.

08:33.434 --> 08:34.802
Good morning, Mr. Alzate.

08:34.870 --> 08:36.270
H-h-h-hey.

08:36.337 --> 08:38.873
My little Basque brother.

08:38.941 --> 08:42.808
Kyle, what happened?
Did your shoes call in sick?

08:42.876 --> 08:44.744
It's the salt cod you made for me.

08:44.812 --> 08:47.146
There was so much salt, my feet swelled up.

08:47.214 --> 08:49.182
Then I did it right.

08:49.249 --> 08:51.685
You know, I had a crazy thought.

08:51.752 --> 08:53.252
Why don't we drop everything

08:53.320 --> 08:55.355
And take a trip to the old country? Huh?

08:56.790 --> 08:58.958
Come on.
What about my job?

08:59.025 --> 09:00.392
Yeah-- oh, Mike'll let you go.

09:00.460 --> 09:02.294
He-- he always said that you could be replaced

09:02.362 --> 09:05.664
By a monkey wrench, so... Just...

09:05.732 --> 09:08.333
Oh, I thought he just said "monkey."

09:08.401 --> 09:10.569
I feel much better now.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.837
So, uh, what do you think?
What do you think? Come on.

09:12.905 --> 09:14.939
- Huh?
- Could we visit the village my people came from?

09:15.007 --> 09:16.474
Sure.
It's called Elorrio.

09:16.542 --> 09:17.976
Elorrio?

09:18.043 --> 09:20.277
That's where my people are from.

09:20.345 --> 09:23.014
I come from a very important family there.

09:23.081 --> 09:24.415
As do I.

09:24.483 --> 09:26.350
Uh, the Ostolazas.

09:26.418 --> 09:29.252
The Ostolazas?

09:29.320 --> 09:30.721
You're an Ostolaza?

09:30.788 --> 09:32.656
Mm-hmm. So when would we leave?

09:32.724 --> 09:34.525
How about never?
How does that work for you?

09:35.693 --> 09:37.694
I don't understand.

09:37.762 --> 09:40.196
Instead, why don't you take
a trip to the loading dock

09:40.264 --> 09:42.065
And clean the grease stains?

09:42.133 --> 09:43.433
But why?
Why? Because that way

09:43.501 --> 09:45.868
I don't have to look at your face, that's why.

09:47.905 --> 09:51.807
And put your shoes on!
You smell like the dead sea!

10:00.783 --> 10:02.951
See? It's just like fishing rods

10:03.019 --> 10:04.819
And hunting rifles,

10:04.887 --> 10:06.555
Blah, blah, blah, it's boring.

10:06.622 --> 10:09.390
Yeah, well, I wanted to see
the place for myself...

10:09.458 --> 10:12.060
And apologize to your dad.

10:12.127 --> 10:13.828
But I told you he's gone for the day.

10:13.896 --> 10:15.996
Oh. So I'll-- I'll leave a note.

10:16.064 --> 10:18.265
<i>Aw!</i> That's so sweet of you.

10:18.332 --> 10:21.301
You are like a prince in a boxy hemp sweater.

10:21.369 --> 10:24.972
And you are a beautiful princess in a...

10:26.240 --> 10:27.875
Wow.
Hmm?

10:27.943 --> 10:30.210
Oh, yeah. That's new.

10:30.278 --> 10:32.311
That's my dad's pride and joy.

10:32.379 --> 10:33.913
What a majestic creature.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.748
Yeah, I know.

10:35.816 --> 10:37.750
Apparently its name is Ed.

10:41.021 --> 10:43.522
So yesterday I'm his little Basque brother,

10:43.591 --> 10:45.157
And now he'll barely even speak to me.

10:45.225 --> 10:46.726
Well, did you ask what's wrong?

10:46.794 --> 10:48.060
I was too scared.

10:48.127 --> 10:49.394
Did you ask my dad to talk to him?

10:49.462 --> 10:51.997
I was too embarrassed.

10:52.065 --> 10:55.166
Whoa, you sound like a real
go-getter over there, Kyle.

10:55.234 --> 10:58.070
Eve, stop making fun of my boyfriend.

10:58.137 --> 11:00.606
Hey, babe, why do you smell so salty?

11:01.841 --> 11:04.008
All right, here we go.

11:04.076 --> 11:06.944
According to local history, the Ostolazas

11:07.012 --> 11:08.913
Have been mortal enemies of the Alzates

11:08.981 --> 11:11.782
For nearly 200 years.
Really? Why?

11:11.850 --> 11:15.052
Well, let's see. Apparently
an Ostolaza stole a pig

11:15.120 --> 11:16.787
Which belonged to an Alzate,

11:16.855 --> 11:19.323
Which led to a house burning,

11:19.390 --> 11:21.224
Then a murder.

11:21.291 --> 11:24.027
And then another murder.

11:24.095 --> 11:26.329
Lots of murder.

11:26.396 --> 11:28.464
Okay. All right.
I get it,

11:28.532 --> 11:30.900
But why is Mr. Alzate mad at <i>me?</i>

11:30.968 --> 11:33.870
I didn't even know I was Basque
until two days ago.

11:33.938 --> 11:36.238
He's very into his heritage, Kyle.

11:36.305 --> 11:38.306
It's a part of his code of honor.

11:38.374 --> 11:40.109
Honor.

11:40.176 --> 11:42.011
Honor is what starts these feuds.

11:42.078 --> 11:45.981
If there was no honor, the world
would be a much better place.

11:47.150 --> 11:49.551
I-I don't think that's right.

11:51.587 --> 11:53.287
Oh, hey, Mandy. We heard.

11:53.355 --> 11:55.556
We're really sorry about
what happened with Terrence.

11:55.624 --> 11:56.924
Yeah. We were really looking
forward to meeting him.

11:56.992 --> 11:58.392
Whatever.
You two don't care.

11:58.460 --> 12:01.696
You're like Romeo and Juliet's ugly stepsisters.

12:05.067 --> 12:07.901
No, I don't think that's right, either.

12:07.969 --> 12:09.435
You missed dinner.
What happened?

12:09.503 --> 12:11.204
I was with Terrence.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.539
Well, Mandy, you know the rules.

12:12.606 --> 12:13.774
You're supposed to call.

12:13.841 --> 12:15.809
Terrence says society has too many rules.

12:17.311 --> 12:20.280
All right, look, Mandy, I-I know
you really like this boy.

12:20.347 --> 12:22.783
No, I don't like him.
I love him.

12:22.850 --> 12:24.216
Okay. All right, you know what?

12:24.284 --> 12:28.220
Just, um, let's-- let's put a pin in that. Um...

12:28.288 --> 12:32.825
Look, he-- he's handsome and rebellious

12:32.893 --> 12:35.561
And he knows how to give it to <i>"the man."</i>

12:35.628 --> 12:37.930
But, Mandy, trust me,

12:37.998 --> 12:40.131
In a few weeks, a-a guy like that,

12:40.199 --> 12:42.500
He's just gonna leave you
standing alone in the rain

12:42.568 --> 12:44.102
Outside of a Yes concert

12:44.170 --> 12:45.904
Because some woman named Meredith

12:45.971 --> 12:49.440
Had hydroponic plants to show him in her van!

12:52.344 --> 12:55.013
I don't understand anything you just said.

12:56.514 --> 12:58.015
Mandy, come in here a minute, please.

12:59.984 --> 13:02.552
Listen, if you're gonna
miss dinner, you gotta call.

13:02.620 --> 13:05.222
I was with Terrence,
who you never gave a chance to.

13:05.289 --> 13:07.557
Whom. A chance was not given.

13:08.860 --> 13:11.628
Because he has the manners of a dingo.

13:11.696 --> 13:14.430
That is an outrageous thing
to say. And what is a dingo?

13:17.167 --> 13:20.369
Never mind.

13:20.437 --> 13:22.872
If you're gonna be late, you've got to call.

13:22.940 --> 13:24.974
You know what, dad? You're all wrong about Terrence.
Yeah?

13:25.042 --> 13:27.176
He's actually very open-minded.

13:27.244 --> 13:30.011
In fact, he asked me to take him to outdoor man.

13:30.079 --> 13:31.646
He wanted to come apologize to you.

13:31.714 --> 13:33.648
When did you guys go to outdoor man?

13:33.716 --> 13:35.083
Mm, right before closing.

13:35.151 --> 13:36.451
And he stayed behind to leave you a note.

13:36.518 --> 13:37.753
You didn't leave together?

13:37.820 --> 13:39.354
No. I had a nail appointment.

13:39.421 --> 13:41.389
Oh. Get in the truck.
Why?

13:41.457 --> 13:43.491
I got a very bad feeling about this.

13:54.702 --> 13:57.271
Oh, <i>man!</i>

13:59.274 --> 14:01.207
Look what he did to this thing.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.812
"Phart was here"?

14:07.314 --> 14:10.984
The "h" is silent.

14:18.675 --> 14:20.808
I don't understand.
Why would Terrence do this?

14:20.876 --> 14:23.044
So they can post pictures of this on the Internet.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.113
He pretended he was coming here for me.

14:25.181 --> 14:27.115
He said I was the most
important thing in his world.

14:27.183 --> 14:29.616
How could I have been so wrong about someone?

14:29.684 --> 14:31.618
You have very low standards, honey.

14:34.089 --> 14:36.457
Dad, I'm sorry he painted your bear.

14:36.524 --> 14:39.326
Sorry your boyfriend defaced
a piece of American history.

14:39.394 --> 14:41.728
I mean, presidents would shoot stuff like this.

14:41.796 --> 14:43.263
Now what do they do?
They chase turkeys

14:43.331 --> 14:44.865
Around the white house garden.

14:44.932 --> 14:47.600
Come here, little guy.
Come on.

14:49.370 --> 14:51.371
I'm an idiot.

14:51.438 --> 14:54.507
No. No, you're not.
No, you're not.

14:54.574 --> 14:56.976
- Yeah. Oh, come on.
- You didn't mean for this to happen.

14:57.044 --> 14:59.578
Come here, baby.
Listen. Listen.

14:59.646 --> 15:01.413
I know you feel bad.
It's okay.

15:01.481 --> 15:02.780
I hate him, dad.

15:02.848 --> 15:04.349
Let it out.

15:04.417 --> 15:07.652
I want to saw his legs off and make him eat them.

15:07.720 --> 15:09.521
Ease it back a little bit.

15:16.896 --> 15:19.363
- What'd you see in this guy?
- I don't know.

15:19.431 --> 15:21.465
He's passionate, confident.

15:21.533 --> 15:23.334
He yells a lot.

15:23.402 --> 15:26.003
For some reason, it just felt familiar.

15:28.673 --> 15:31.975
God, I just wish there was some
way to teach that jerk a lesson.

15:32.044 --> 15:34.777
Me, too.
Wait a minute.

15:34.845 --> 15:37.980
Maybe there is.
What do you mean?

15:38.049 --> 15:40.583
- We came by the loading dock. That door was shut.
- Right.

15:40.651 --> 15:42.952
I unlocked the front door.
The alarm wasn't tripped.

15:45.456 --> 15:47.357
This paint is still wet.

15:47.425 --> 15:50.092
Wait, so...

15:50.160 --> 15:52.861
He's still in here.

15:56.832 --> 16:00.001
Dad, do you think he's up here?

16:00.070 --> 16:02.104
We've checked everywhere else.

16:02.172 --> 16:04.239
Just be really quiet.
See if you can hear something.

16:04.307 --> 16:06.107
Okay.

16:08.310 --> 16:09.377
what? What? What?

16:09.445 --> 16:11.079
Yeah, oh, hey, honey, it's me.

16:11.146 --> 16:12.813
Listen, I was thinking about Terrence.

16:12.881 --> 16:14.582
There was something really creepy about that kid.

16:14.649 --> 16:16.584
I-I don't think we should
let Mandy see him anymore.

16:16.651 --> 16:19.087
I think you're a tad late.

16:20.322 --> 16:22.489
"It's her... Sad fate"?

16:22.557 --> 16:24.357
No, no, no, no.

16:24.425 --> 16:26.460
You're a <i>tad late.</i>

16:26.527 --> 16:29.362
Bad bait?

16:29.430 --> 16:31.131
I can't talk now.

16:35.236 --> 16:37.570
Seriously?!

16:37.637 --> 16:39.271
Hello?

16:39.339 --> 16:41.140
- Honey, is your father drunk? What the hell--
- Is that your mom?

16:41.208 --> 16:42.341
Honey!

16:45.278 --> 16:48.214
oh! For God sakes!

16:48.281 --> 16:50.316
We'll be home soon. Bye!

16:57.189 --> 16:58.856
check downstairs.

16:58.924 --> 17:00.358
- What? We just looked there.
- Check one more time.

17:00.426 --> 17:01.993
- Look at the bottom of the stairs.
- Okay.

17:03.496 --> 17:05.463
Oh, Terrence?

17:05.531 --> 17:07.064
I can hear you.

17:07.133 --> 17:08.699
I'm gonna count to ten, you're gonna come out,

17:08.767 --> 17:12.636
Because, trust me, you do not
want me coming and getting you.

17:12.703 --> 17:14.738
- One...
- I'm here!

17:20.310 --> 17:23.079
Go ahead and call the police.
My dad will just pay the fine.

17:23.147 --> 17:24.848
I'm not calling the police.

17:25.982 --> 17:27.415
Then can I?

17:29.786 --> 17:32.321
Listen, Terrence, you can
come by my house and be rude.

17:32.389 --> 17:33.922
I can handle that.

17:33.990 --> 17:36.259
You can come by my office
and desecrate this place,

17:36.326 --> 17:38.361
And I can handle <i>that.</i>

17:38.428 --> 17:41.463
Hurt my kid, I can't handle that.

17:41.531 --> 17:44.366
Yeah, well, you hurt that bear when you killed it.

17:44.433 --> 17:46.268
I didn't hurt that bear!

17:46.335 --> 17:49.937
Teddy Roosevelt shot that bear in 1895.

17:50.005 --> 17:55.943
Yeah, well, see...
I didn't know that.

17:56.011 --> 17:57.478
Did you ever have feelings for my daughter,

17:57.546 --> 17:58.879
Or was it all about that?

17:58.946 --> 18:00.548
Yes. I liked her,

18:00.615 --> 18:04.285
But then I found out who
you were, and I had to strike...

18:04.352 --> 18:05.886
For the cause.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.460
So...

18:14.528 --> 18:16.329
How's that cause feel right about now?

18:16.397 --> 18:18.665
Still passionate...

18:18.732 --> 18:20.733
Ish.

18:25.206 --> 18:26.839
What are you gonna do to me?

18:29.309 --> 18:31.543
So many options.

18:33.746 --> 18:36.848
Aha! T-h-a-n-g.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.483
"Thang."

18:42.288 --> 18:44.789
"thang" is not a word.

18:44.857 --> 18:48.526
Yeah-huh.
"Ain't nothin' but a thang."

18:48.594 --> 18:51.629
Just because you say it doesn't make it a word.

18:51.697 --> 18:52.763
So look it up.

18:52.831 --> 18:54.932
Where's the dictionary?

18:54.999 --> 18:56.100
Upstairs.

18:56.167 --> 18:57.134
Fine, it's a word.

18:57.202 --> 18:58.969
Yeah!

19:01.339 --> 19:02.972
Hey.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.775
- Hey.
- So man sandals vandalized the store?

19:08.078 --> 19:10.780
- Yeah.
- Oh, Mandy, honey, are you okay?

19:10.848 --> 19:12.815
No. I was in love, and I got dumped

19:12.883 --> 19:15.385
- Outside in the rain at a Yes concert.
- Oh!

19:17.087 --> 19:19.421
That guy really did a number on you, didn't he?

19:22.091 --> 19:23.492
So, dad, did you call the police?

19:23.560 --> 19:25.628
Justice will be served.

19:25.695 --> 19:26.895
What do you mean?

19:26.963 --> 19:28.764
Well...

19:31.000 --> 19:32.901
Mike Baxter here for outdoor man.

19:32.969 --> 19:35.336
My buddy back here-- 800-pound grizzly bear,

19:35.404 --> 19:37.405
Shot by Teddy Roosevelt.

19:37.473 --> 19:38.773
Pretty impressive.
Stop on down.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.575
You can take a look at it in person.

19:40.643 --> 19:42.644
And while you're here, you can
actually <i>meet</i> Teddy Roosevelt.

19:42.711 --> 19:44.312
Turns out he's not only not dead,

19:44.380 --> 19:45.680
He's a lot younger than he used to be.

19:45.748 --> 19:47.248
Teddy, come on in.

19:53.354 --> 19:55.422
Not only was I a great president,

19:55.490 --> 19:59.359
But I also created our country's
first national parks.

20:01.462 --> 20:03.463
How much longer do I have to keep doing this?

20:03.531 --> 20:06.666
Till the bear says you can stop.

20:06.733 --> 20:08.233
The bear can't talk.

20:08.302 --> 20:10.869
There you go.

20:21.227 --> 20:24.530
Hi, Mr. Alzate.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.833
Kyle... Listen...

20:26.900 --> 20:27.900
About yesterday--

20:27.968 --> 20:30.269
Uh. The Ostolazas and the Alzates--

20:30.337 --> 20:31.637
Mortal enemies.

20:31.705 --> 20:34.306
Started with the pig.
I know all about it.

20:34.374 --> 20:36.675
See, I was raised to hate the Ostolazas,

20:36.742 --> 20:39.311
Even before I s s old enough to understand why.

20:39.379 --> 20:41.947
See, it's like a reflex, like sneezing

20:42.015 --> 20:43.815
Or sleeping with a beautiful woman.

20:43.883 --> 20:47.052
Now I know it's not your fault,

20:47.120 --> 20:49.989
So I'm gonna try to get over it, all right?

20:50.056 --> 20:52.623
Or... We could finally end the feud.

20:52.691 --> 20:54.292
Follow me.

21:00.599 --> 21:03.901
I hope your ancestors will be appeased.

21:03.969 --> 21:06.904
Ohh! Kyle.
Come here, baby. Come--

21:09.807 --> 21:12.442
I'm deeply moved, Kyle.

21:12.510 --> 21:14.911
As much as revenge is part of Basque culture,

21:14.979 --> 21:16.613
So is forgiveness.

21:16.680 --> 21:18.215
All right.

21:18.282 --> 21:19.449
okay.

21:19.517 --> 21:22.486
So... The slate is clean.

21:22.553 --> 21:24.186
Thank you, my friend.
Thank you.

21:24.254 --> 21:26.155
My pleasure.
Sure.

21:26.223 --> 21:27.623
And now... Let's eat.

21:27.690 --> 21:28.824
Huh?

21:28.892 --> 21:30.258
What?

21:30.326 --> 21:31.960
I'm joking! Joking!
