00:42.660 --> 00:46.080
Why don't you, like, ever
realize the truth, Vince?

00:46.120 --> 00:48.531
I ate nine pies and
a meatball hero in one hour.

00:48.532 --> 00:49.332
That's a record.

00:49.420 --> 00:51.380
It wasn't nine pies. It was eight.

00:51.420 --> 00:54.680
You left two slices of
mushroom on the last tray.

00:54.720 --> 00:59.180
- Violet?
- You guys, it was six pies. No hero.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.095
I had to call the paramedics
to pump your stomach,

01:01.096 --> 01:02.930
and it was three and a half years ago.

01:02.980 --> 01:04.980
When are you guys gonna
talk about something else?

01:05.099 --> 01:08.060
When someone comes through
that door and breaks the record,

01:08.110 --> 01:10.770
then we'll stop talkin'
about the subject.

01:10.900 --> 01:13.030
Enjoy your pie, guys.

01:13.150 --> 01:16.320
- It's the last one I'll ever serve.
- Aren't you forgetting something?

01:16.410 --> 01:18.870
Quit it, Pete.
I'm not doin' that.

01:21.450 --> 01:24.410
It's a tradition. Sign the card.

01:32.750 --> 01:36.300
I got it, folks. I got
the first autograph.

01:36.380 --> 01:39.600
- Hey, Violet. All right!
- Violet's on her way to the wall.

01:42.760 --> 01:45.140
That's 20 years of girls leaving town.

01:47.310 --> 01:50.940
That wall is jinxed. I
won't sit near that wall.

01:51.020 --> 01:54.030
Let's hope you have
better luck than they did.

01:54.150 --> 01:58.280
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:58.320 --> 02:01.780
As you all know, my best
friend, Violet Sanford,

02:01.830 --> 02:04.290
has decided..

02:04.370 --> 02:08.370
has decided to leave
South Amboy tomorrow...

02:08.419 --> 02:12.340
and travel the 42
miles to New York City.

02:12.460 --> 02:15.420
So.. Okay, come on.
Bring her up here, girls.

02:15.460 --> 02:19.640
Come on, Violet.

02:19.680 --> 02:23.680
Come on, Vi. Come on, everyone.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.480
Hey, Violet, come on. Come up here.

02:26.520 --> 02:30.020
- Come on, honey.
- You guys!

02:30.060 --> 02:35.150
Now, I think it's only fair that tonight,
on her last night with us in Jersey,

02:35.230 --> 02:39.320
she grace us with a little tune.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.660
No way!

02:41.740 --> 02:44.990
<i>At first I was afraid I was petrified</i>

02:45.080 --> 02:49.540
<i>Kept thinkin' I could never
live without you by my side</i>

02:49.620 --> 02:53.960
<i>Then I spent so many nights
thinking how you did me wrong</i>

02:54.040 --> 02:57.710
<i>And I grew strong and
I knew how to get along</i>

02:57.760 --> 02:59.970
<i>No, not I</i>

03:00.050 --> 03:02.260
<i>I will survive</i>

03:02.340 --> 03:06.345
<i>Oh, as long as I know how
to love I know I'll be alive</i>

03:06.380 --> 03:10.350
<i>I got all my life to live
I got all my love to give</i>

03:10.390 --> 03:14.060
<i>I'll survive I will survive</i>

03:19.070 --> 03:20.950
Look at this!

03:21.070 --> 03:24.530
Four people killed
last night in New York.

03:24.580 --> 03:26.540
No reason at all.

03:26.580 --> 03:29.200
Police have no leads.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.710
- Tragic.
- Dad, what're you doin'?

03:31.790 --> 03:34.380
I guess four out of seven
million ain't so bad.

03:34.500 --> 03:37.090
Headlines should read,
"Millions Survive Night in New York. "

03:38.300 --> 03:39.460
Dad, stop,
I get the point.

03:39.461 --> 03:40.220
Here...
Eat your eggs.

03:40.340 --> 03:42.295
They're not eggs.
They're egg whites.

03:42.396 --> 03:44.050
And I'd rather eat the carton.

03:44.090 --> 03:46.280
You've already lost six pounds.
You're staying on this diet.

03:46.281 --> 03:48.470
No fast food.
No sausage.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.940
Oh, and I bought you some of those Lean
Cuisine meals, and I put 'em in the freezer.

03:51.980 --> 03:53.795
My mouth is watering already.

03:53.796 --> 03:55.610
And I lined your vitamins
up on the counter.

03:55.690 --> 03:59.780
- I don't take vitamins.
- You do now. Just take them.

03:59.860 --> 04:03.410
Oh, and I put fresh batteries in the
TV remote and set the V.C.R. Timer so..

04:03.530 --> 04:05.820
Excuse me. Excuse me. Am
I missing something here?

04:05.870 --> 04:09.700
I'm the parent. You're the child
running away to live by herself.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.660
I should be tellin' you how to live.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.920
Fine. How should I live?

04:14.040 --> 04:17.130
Simple. Don't go.

04:17.250 --> 04:21.670
I got that Irish Spring you like.
Oh. And Dad, whatever you do..

04:21.720 --> 04:24.840
- Don't do the laundry.
- Don't do the laundry.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.550
Just leave it by the dryer and I'll
do it when I come home every Sunday.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.560
Ah, this is interesting.

04:29.680 --> 04:33.690
They say the handrails on the subway system
could one day lead to an outbreak of plague.

04:33.810 --> 04:38.070
Dad. Look.

04:38.110 --> 04:40.730
You said I could be whatever I wanna be.

04:40.860 --> 04:43.610
I never said songwriter in New
York City. That's the exception.

04:43.650 --> 04:47.820
You said anything, and
I believed you, so..

04:47.870 --> 04:50.620
I'm not leavin' this
house without your support.

04:50.700 --> 04:53.960
That's Gloria. What's it gonna be?

04:58.920 --> 05:03.880
Violet, I saw how hard it was for
your mother when she didn't make it.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.510
But if she was here,
she'd tell me to shut up,

05:06.590 --> 05:10.260
wish you luck and give you a big hug.

05:10.310 --> 05:14.350
I'm not gonna give you a big hug, and
I'm not gonna wish you luck, but...

05:14.430 --> 05:17.650
I am gonna shut up, sit here with
my coffee and pretend to be mad.

05:17.770 --> 05:20.190
Is that okay?

05:27.530 --> 05:29.950
This is the last of it.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.660
- Honey, are you okay with that?
- Yeah, I got it.

05:32.740 --> 05:35.410
I got it. Wait.

05:35.540 --> 05:38.380
All right. That's everything.

05:38.420 --> 05:42.090
- Let's hit it.
- Good luck.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.220
There, I said it.

05:55.230 --> 05:56.365
Love you.

05:56.466 --> 05:58.083
Put some pepper spray in your purse.

05:58.084 --> 06:02.320
Even if you're not sure.
Just start spraying.

06:04.480 --> 06:07.320
You know, you're not alone, Mr. Sanford.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.620
Hey, you know, me and you
should have dinner sometime.

06:10.820 --> 06:13.240
I'm lockin' the doors.

06:13.290 --> 06:17.620
<i>At first I was afraid I was petrified</i>

06:17.660 --> 06:22.040
<i>Kept thinkin' I could never
live without you by my side</i>

06:22.090 --> 06:24.510
<i>Oh, no, not I</i>

06:24.550 --> 06:26.420
<i>I will survive</i>

06:26.470 --> 06:31.050
<i>As long as I have love to
give I know I'll be alive</i>

06:31.090 --> 06:35.310
<i>I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give/</i>

06:35.430 --> 06:37.940
<i>I will survive</i>

06:38.060 --> 06:40.100
<i>I will survive</i>

06:40.150 --> 06:42.060
All right. This is it.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.490
What do you think?

06:53.530 --> 06:56.050
I had a feeling you
were gonna need this.

06:56.090 --> 06:57.010
What are you doing?

06:57.111 --> 07:00.330
What? It's just some
emergency cash I saved up.

07:00.370 --> 07:04.500
Honey, from the looks of this
place, I'd say this is our emergency.

07:04.550 --> 07:07.590
Well, I'm not takin' it.

07:11.130 --> 07:13.550
Fine, then.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.140
I'm freezing your assets.

07:16.220 --> 07:18.850
So, thanks for everything.

07:18.930 --> 07:22.520
I'll call ya.

07:22.600 --> 07:25.820
What is this?

07:25.900 --> 07:30.610
It's just that all our lives, you know, we
always had one thing in common, you and me.

07:30.650 --> 07:33.820
What are you talking about?

07:33.870 --> 07:36.950
It's like, you know we said we
wouldn't lose our virginity...

07:36.990 --> 07:38.950
until we got married,
and that didn't happen.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
And then we said we'd go to
college or junior college...

07:43.080 --> 07:44.960
or dental hygienist school, you know.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.670
And that didn't happen.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.630
We've never followed through
on a single thing, you know.

07:52.760 --> 07:55.600
And I think that's what
makes us so special.

07:55.720 --> 07:59.100
And this is why you're crying?

07:59.180 --> 08:01.600
Well...

08:01.640 --> 08:04.860
a long time ago you told me that
you were gonna move to New York.

08:04.900 --> 08:07.465
But everyone thought
you'd just stay in Jersey

08:07.466 --> 08:10.030
and get married like
me and Danny are gonna...

08:10.110 --> 08:12.570
You know. And
- And look at you.

08:13.610 --> 08:18.450
No matter what, you really did it right,

08:18.490 --> 08:20.450
and I'm so proud of you.

08:45.270 --> 08:48.110
Enough! You hear me?

08:48.230 --> 08:51.650
You be quiet! Enough in there!

08:51.690 --> 08:58.990
<i>I don't like to be alone in the night</i>

08:59.030 --> 09:05.290
<i>And I don't like to hear
I'm wrong when I'm right</i>

09:05.330 --> 09:08.540
<i>And I don't like to</i>

09:08.590 --> 09:12.260
<i>Have the rain on my shoe</i>

09:21.140 --> 09:25.100
Hi. I'm Violet Sanford. I just
recently moved to New York,

09:25.140 --> 09:28.110
and I was wondering if you would
give my tape to one of your artists.

09:28.150 --> 09:30.770
Violet, that is so cute.

09:30.820 --> 09:34.820
Now, let me tell you about me. My name
is Wendy, and I first moved to New York...

09:34.860 --> 09:37.820
when I was 21 to be a dancer,
but I broke my big toe.

09:37.870 --> 09:41.080
And then I got knocked up by this actor
who dumped me to join the Peace Corps.

09:41.200 --> 09:45.000
So for the last 16 years I been
raisin' my daughter all by myself.

09:45.080 --> 09:49.330
And then two weeks ago she tells
me that she is a bisexual...

09:49.380 --> 09:53.960
and that she hates me more
than any person on this planet.

09:54.010 --> 09:59.300
Now, tell me how I can help you, please,

09:59.340 --> 10:03.930
because I am dying to
make your dreams come true.

10:05.680 --> 10:08.190
You don't take the tape
unless it comes from an agent,

10:08.310 --> 10:10.610
but I can't get an agent
until I get published?

10:10.730 --> 10:13.280
If we were to listen to that tape,
that would give you grounds...

10:13.400 --> 10:15.940
for a copyright or plagiarism lawsuit.

10:15.990 --> 10:19.780
It's just a little tape. All I
want is someone to sing my songs.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.030
Welcome to the music business.

10:28.580 --> 10:30.500
- Good evening. I.D., please.
- Hi. Uh, sure.

10:30.580 --> 10:34.000
<i>Maybe</i>

10:34.130 --> 10:39.680
<i>Find a way to make it back someday</i>

10:39.800 --> 10:42.100
- What can I get you?
- Let me ask you something.

10:42.220 --> 10:45.890
I'm a songwriter. Is there someone
here I could talk to about my songs?

10:45.930 --> 10:48.480
I've been a struggling
sax player for 12 years.

10:48.600 --> 10:51.980
- What can I get you from the bar?
- Pepsi and some crackers.

10:54.940 --> 10:58.570
Hey. How are you doing?

10:58.610 --> 11:01.490
<i>Then I hope there's someone out there</i>

11:01.570 --> 11:05.240
Excuse me. Who's that guy?

11:06.950 --> 11:08.870
That would be Mr. O'Donnell.

11:10.790 --> 11:13.790
Mr. O'Donnell. He's the
manager or something?

11:15.630 --> 11:20.930
Yeah. He's the music manager. He's
in charge of finding bands and...

11:21.050 --> 11:23.760
booking new talent.

11:25.220 --> 11:30.230
<i>Run away with my heart</i>

11:30.350 --> 11:33.610
<i>Run away with my hope</i>

11:33.650 --> 11:35.570
Hey, where the hell were you, O'Donnell?

11:35.690 --> 11:38.360
I got 15 orders stacked up here
and nobody to run the grill.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.490
Fifteen orders, Walt. Is that all?

11:40.610 --> 11:43.820
Gimme ten minutes, I'll
catch us up. Go on. Lie down.

11:43.950 --> 11:46.910
Relax. You look tired.

11:46.990 --> 11:49.450
We can talk about my raise later.

11:49.500 --> 11:53.080
You think this is Australia? There's
no raise. I'm about to fire you.

11:58.960 --> 12:02.890
Um, excuse me. Mr. O'Donnell?

12:02.930 --> 12:04.850
- Yes.
- Mr. O'Donnell. My name is Violet Sanford.

12:04.970 --> 12:07.260
I'm a songwriter. I just
wanted to give this to you.

12:07.310 --> 12:11.060
I know it's not the most
professional way to submit a tape.

12:11.140 --> 12:15.060
- But this is all pretty new to me.
- It's pretty new to me too.

12:15.110 --> 12:18.545
I just figured as the
manager of a club like this,

12:18.646 --> 12:19.780
you must know every
band on the East Coast.

12:19.900 --> 12:24.990
The manager of this club.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.370
- You guys go ahead. I'll catch up.
- Sure thing.

12:33.460 --> 12:36.340
Mr. O'Donnell.

12:39.250 --> 12:42.340
I don't usually do this, Violet.

12:42.420 --> 12:45.180
Um, but I have a feeling about you.

12:45.260 --> 12:49.515
So I'm gonna take your tape,
and I'm gonna see what I can do.

12:49.616 --> 12:50.970
Thank you.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.940
I can't believe how easy this was.

12:55.060 --> 12:57.810
Neither can I.

12:57.860 --> 13:01.400
Uh, you wanna go for
some coffee or something?

13:01.490 --> 13:03.740
O'Donnell, who do I look
like? Your god damn maid?

13:05.030 --> 13:06.910
That's Mr. O'Donnell,

13:07.030 --> 13:09.030
but I'll let it slide this time.

13:09.160 --> 13:11.870
I told you to take your
stuff home and wash it.

13:11.910 --> 13:13.660
You got cow grease caked on the front.

13:13.750 --> 13:19.500
Walt, I've warned you about
your attitude.. You're fired.

13:19.550 --> 13:21.300
Oh, you better not push me, kid.

13:21.420 --> 13:26.300
I can find a hundred other little punks
like you, can burn a turkey burger.

13:28.050 --> 13:30.640
Minimum wage punk.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.860
Maybe we should start over. Uh...

13:37.900 --> 13:40.110
I'm Kevin O'Donnell,

13:40.230 --> 13:43.780
and I work the grill here
at the Fiji Mermaid Club.

13:44.900 --> 13:48.490
I just made a complete fool of myself.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.540
I was gonna tell you.

13:53.410 --> 13:56.170
I'm almost sure I would have told you.

13:57.620 --> 14:00.380
I just want you to know
I'm not following you home.

14:00.460 --> 14:03.960
I'm just walking myself26
blocks in the wrong direction.

14:04.010 --> 14:07.630
- I asked you to leave me alone.
- Did I mention how sorry I am?

14:07.760 --> 14:10.100
I mean, not that it's all my
fault. You did throw yourself at me.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.100
I didn't throw myself at you.

14:12.180 --> 14:14.930
I was pretending to be sweet and
innocent so you'd give me a break.

14:14.980 --> 14:17.390
- Can I ask you a question?
- What?

14:17.440 --> 14:20.610
Is there a reason we just
walked in a circle? Are you lost?

14:20.730 --> 14:23.030
I'm not lost. Somebody
just moved my street.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.950
You.. You wanna play a game?

14:26.990 --> 14:28.910
I bet I can guess where you're from.

14:29.030 --> 14:32.030
I'm about to get out my pepper spray.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.040
I reckon you're from a big city.

14:34.160 --> 14:36.910
And there's no sign from
here of a belly button ring...

14:37.000 --> 14:39.420
or a tongue piercing.

14:39.500 --> 14:42.960
I gotta go with Chicago.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.380
I've never had anyone stare at my ass for
half an hour, so I'm gonna say good night.

14:46.470 --> 14:48.550
And I'm hoping you're gonna say it back.

14:48.630 --> 14:53.310
Okay. I can take a hint.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.710
I really do know a lot of
people in the music business.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.780
You just don't give up, do ya?

14:57.781 --> 15:00.415
Well, it was the sweet and
innocent thing. It did me in.

15:00.416 --> 15:02.270
Good night, Kevin.

15:02.310 --> 15:06.530
Just for the record, I was only staring
at your ass for the first 15 minutes.

15:16.290 --> 15:19.120
- William Morris.
- I don't mean to interrupt.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.920
- I just want to leave
this- - I'll transfer.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.590
- William Morris. Please hold.
- It's a demo. I'm a songwriter.

15:23.710 --> 15:26.760
William Morris. I'll be right with you.

15:29.170 --> 15:32.340
I just want to leave this
for Whitney and Mariah.

15:32.390 --> 15:33.700
I'm sure they're
personal friends of yours.

15:33.901 --> 15:35.010
Look.

15:35.060 --> 15:38.850
I'm sure it sounds great in your shower,
but karaoke ended a half hour ago.

15:38.890 --> 15:41.140
So if you'd like to get your songs
heard, you're gonna have to take them...

15:41.190 --> 15:43.980
to an open midnight
just like everyone else.

15:45.570 --> 15:48.740
William Morris.

15:48.860 --> 15:52.910
I'll transfer. You're
not getting validated.

16:09.380 --> 16:13.050
<i>Caught in a mirror</i>

16:13.140 --> 16:17.260
<i>Looking through sympathetic eyes</i>

16:17.390 --> 16:20.730
Can I help you?

16:20.850 --> 16:24.610
Yeah, hi. Uh, I'm sure all your
spaces are filled for tonight.

16:24.730 --> 16:28.530
I just wanted to come down and check out
what this whole open mic thing was about.

16:28.570 --> 16:32.650
I can squeeze you in ten minutes. A
couple of my regulars, they called in sick.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.990
So, uh, I've got some spaces to fill.

16:35.070 --> 16:37.660
I need you to sign your name
in here and get yourself ready.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Bathroom's around the corner
if you want to throw up.

16:44.790 --> 16:48.820
Next up we have a young
lady named Violet Sanford.

16:48.921 --> 16:50.422
So let's put our hands together,

16:50.423 --> 16:53.125
for New Jersey's own Violet Sanford!

16:53.173 --> 16:53.873
Come on up, Violet.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.090
Good! There we go. Yeah. Whoo!

16:56.140 --> 17:01.770
Yea, Violet!

17:05.770 --> 17:09.780
- I'm a little nervous.
- So are we, honey.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.319
Don't tease me, honey! Sing!

17:13.400 --> 17:15.990
Come on, give her a break.

17:17.319 --> 17:19.790
I'm sorry.

17:36.840 --> 17:38.800
Hello?

18:14.590 --> 18:16.880
You gotta cheer up. You look
like somebody ran over your dog.

18:16.970 --> 18:21.760
Hey, um, how much is a slice of pie?

18:25.680 --> 18:29.270
we happen to have the
best French apple in town.

18:29.350 --> 18:32.020
And, uh, it's on the house.

18:32.070 --> 18:35.280
- Shut up.
- You just have to pay attention.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.320
- Okay?
- Twenty.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.870
- Twenty says it's Pretty Woman.
- I will raise you ten,

18:39.910 --> 18:41.780
because it is Home Alone.

18:41.830 --> 18:44.160
You guys have to read the signs.

18:44.240 --> 18:47.000
I call with Saving Private Ryan.

18:47.080 --> 18:49.685
- What?
- Let's fip this over,

18:49.686 --> 18:55.130
And Miss Jennifer from Austin
says her favorite movie is...

18:55.210 --> 18:58.930
No way. There's no way!
You already saw this one.

18:59.050 --> 19:00.890
Oh, you are such a cheater.

19:01.010 --> 19:05.270
Hello. A naked girl in army
boots? Easy play to call.

19:05.390 --> 19:08.230
- Thank you.
- Those boots are kinda cute.

19:08.310 --> 19:11.360
I have to get me some of those.

19:11.400 --> 19:17.240
Wait, wait, wait. Oh, Romero. You gotta
turn that up, baby. That is the jam.

19:17.320 --> 19:20.990
Turn it up! There you go, there you go.

19:21.070 --> 19:24.700
- Girl, what are you doing?
- Remember this? Remember this?

19:24.790 --> 19:28.250
Belly dancing.

19:36.420 --> 19:38.525
Do you know those girls?

19:38.526 --> 19:40.630
Oh, yeah. They're here every
morning around this time.

19:40.760 --> 19:43.260
- Winding down.
- Wait, wait.

19:43.300 --> 19:46.390
- They have to, in their line of work.
- Are they hookers?

19:46.470 --> 19:48.390
No.

19:52.980 --> 19:55.900
Coyotes.

19:57.690 --> 19:59.950
All right.

20:00.070 --> 20:04.700
You guys? You guys wanna see
what Al gave me for my birthday?

20:06.240 --> 20:08.500
- This.
- You let him brand you?

20:08.620 --> 20:11.080
- Isn't it cute?
- She let the man brand her.

20:11.170 --> 20:15.040
Hey, check it out, ladies.
We each made 300bucks tonight.

20:15.090 --> 20:18.880
You sure you wanna be
goin' off to law school?

20:18.960 --> 20:22.180
Hmm?

20:22.300 --> 20:24.800
Let's make a toast.

20:24.850 --> 20:28.520
To Zoe's last week as a Coyote.

20:28.640 --> 20:32.690
She's gonna be impossible to replace.

20:32.810 --> 20:37.570
I just wanna tell you both that
I will never, ever forget you.

20:53.670 --> 20:57.130
Who's up there?

20:57.250 --> 21:02.170
- I'm lookin' for the owner.
- Hey, come on down. Bring a case with you.

21:05.720 --> 21:08.220
What are you doin' here?

21:08.260 --> 21:10.075
Uh, I'm gonna drop this case.
Where do you want me to put it?

21:10.076 --> 21:11.890
That depends.
What do ya want?

21:11.930 --> 21:15.310
Well, I heard you might need a new, uh..

21:15.350 --> 21:18.020
that, uh, there might be a job opening.

21:18.070 --> 21:21.690
Put it right there. Let
me take a look at ya.

21:23.070 --> 21:25.780
Let me guess.

21:25.860 --> 21:28.080
Piedmont, North Dakota.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.700
South Amboy, New Jersey.

21:30.740 --> 21:33.210
Same thing. You do any drugs?

21:35.580 --> 21:40.000
Just coffee. That's all
I can afford right now.

21:40.050 --> 21:43.590
- Let me see your arms.
- Are you kidding?

21:43.670 --> 21:45.300
Do I look like I'm kidding?

21:47.390 --> 21:49.970
Ooh, where'd you get
that scar on your wrist?

21:50.010 --> 21:52.520
Pizza oven. It's a permanent burn
from pulling slices for four years.

21:52.640 --> 21:55.310
That could be the saddest
thing I've ever heard.

21:56.900 --> 21:59.310
Um, what's next? You
want a urine sample?

21:59.360 --> 22:01.020
I prefer blood.

22:01.070 --> 22:04.900
Look, are you really the owner?
'Cause I've had a rough couple of days,

22:04.950 --> 22:10.700
and so the last thing I need is some
waitress on a power trip wastin' my time.

22:20.920 --> 22:25.550
You start Friday night. Be there
at 11:00. That's when we get busy.

22:28.260 --> 22:31.970
- You're givin' me a job?
- I'm givin' you an audition.

22:32.010 --> 22:33.890
Don't be late, Jersey girl.

22:33.970 --> 22:38.310
I don't mean to press my luck, but would
you mind telling me why you're hiring me?

22:39.730 --> 22:42.480
Because the average male...

22:42.520 --> 22:45.110
is walking around with a
toddler inside of his pants.

22:45.190 --> 22:47.570
A two year old, right
there inside his Dockers.

22:47.650 --> 22:52.780
Men have two-year-old children in their
pants? That's why you're hiring me?

22:52.830 --> 22:55.870
You look like a kindergarten
teacher. The kids'll love it.

22:57.410 --> 22:59.330
Sorry I asked.

23:04.710 --> 23:06.635
I.D., please.

23:06.670 --> 23:09.300
Oh. I'm supposed to
start work here tonight.

23:09.340 --> 23:11.600
Go ahead. Hey, you picked
a good night to start.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.140
It's a little slow right
now, but it should pick up.

23:16.100 --> 23:17.980
<i>Love is like a bomb
Baby, come on get it on</i>

23:18.100 --> 23:21.650
<i>Livin' like a lover with a radar phone</i>

23:21.730 --> 23:24.400
<i>Lookin' like a tramp Like a video vamp</i>

23:24.480 --> 23:27.740
<i>Demolition woman Can I be your man</i>

23:32.990 --> 23:35.240
Is this a church meeting or
is this a bar? Make some noise!

23:42.080 --> 23:44.840
<i>Come on</i>

23:44.920 --> 23:46.960
<i>- Want it?
- Take a bottle</i>

23:47.050 --> 23:49.840
<i>Shake it up</i>

23:49.930 --> 23:52.800
<i>Break the bubble</i>

23:52.850 --> 23:55.260
<i>Break it up</i>

23:55.350 --> 23:57.770
<i>Pour some sugar on me</i>

23:57.890 --> 23:59.810
<i>Ooh, in the name of love</i>

23:59.890 --> 24:04.060
<i>Poor some sugar on me</i>

24:04.190 --> 24:06.480
<i>Come on, fire me up</i>

24:06.530 --> 24:08.990
<i>- Pour your sugar on me
- I'm sorry. Sorry!</i>

24:09.110 --> 24:12.820
- I don't think so.
- Just in time.

24:12.870 --> 24:15.740
- Where you goin'?
- I was looking for you.

24:15.780 --> 24:18.290
Good. Let's go.

24:24.330 --> 24:28.300
<i>Listen, red light, yellow
light, green light, go</i>

24:28.420 --> 24:31.090
<i>Crazy little woman in a one-man show</i>

24:31.180 --> 24:33.640
<i>Mirror queen, mannequin rhythm of love</i>

24:33.760 --> 24:36.760
- Really love your top.
- Thanks.

24:36.810 --> 24:41.230
<i>- I got it, um, on sale..
- Loosen up, uh, loosen up</i>

24:41.350 --> 24:44.520
<i>You gotta squeeze a little squeeze
a little tease a little more</i>

24:46.110 --> 24:49.360
Okay. Hair.

24:49.440 --> 24:53.820
Let's see your moves.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.820
That's Rachel. You can
learn a lot from her.

24:55.870 --> 24:58.950
She just cut some guy's ponytail off.

24:58.990 --> 25:01.660
Yeah. The court ordered her to
take anger management classes...

25:01.710 --> 25:03.830
after she pummelled a
customer for grabbin' her ass.

25:03.870 --> 25:08.800
- He pressed charges. I
gave her a raise. Cheers.

25:08.920 --> 25:12.630
<i>Pour some sugar on me</i>

25:16.470 --> 25:18.095
There is only two rules, okay?

25:18.096 --> 25:19.720
- What do you want?
- Two beers.

25:19.770 --> 25:21.680
- Don't date the customers.
- Okay.

25:21.770 --> 25:26.100
Second, don't ever bring
your boyfriends into my bar.

25:26.150 --> 25:30.230
As of this moment you are to appear
available, but never be available.

25:30.280 --> 25:33.740
Break my rules, I fire you on the spot.

25:33.820 --> 25:36.820
- I understand.
- Jesus.

25:38.530 --> 25:41.250
Hey! Hey, everybody!

25:41.290 --> 25:43.210
Shut up!

25:44.330 --> 25:47.080
I'd like you to meet my new girl...

25:47.130 --> 25:51.210
- whose name is..
- Violet.

25:51.960 --> 25:54.420
Jersey.

25:54.470 --> 25:58.850
Jersey is an ex-kindergarten teacher..

25:58.970 --> 26:02.720
and a former nun who just
escaped from the convent...

26:02.850 --> 26:05.640
and is tired of being the
only virgin in New York City.

26:08.610 --> 26:11.900
Would anyone like to
buy her a drink? Whoa!

26:19.490 --> 26:22.490
- Come on, move! I'm workin' here.
- Sorry.

26:22.540 --> 26:27.040
- Four margaritas with salt.
- All right.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.590
Got tequila. No mix,
no salt, no blender.

26:29.710 --> 26:33.300
- Okay, how about a black Russian?
- Got vodka, no Kahlua.

26:33.420 --> 26:35.840
- White wine.
- Never carry the stuff.

26:35.880 --> 26:37.365
So basically you have...

26:37.366 --> 26:40.050
Jim, Jack, Johnny Red,
Johnny Black and Jose.

26:40.100 --> 26:45.680
All my favourite men. You can have it anyway
you like, as long as it's in a shot glass.

26:45.730 --> 26:48.060
Okay, I'll take a beer.

26:48.150 --> 26:53.030
- Four dollars.
- I'm Cammie, the Russian tease.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.440
Violet, the Jersey nun.

26:55.490 --> 26:57.820
That one's Rachel, the New York bitch.

26:57.910 --> 27:02.030
We all play our little parts,
only Rachel really is a bitch.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.290
And I really am a tease.

27:04.410 --> 27:06.660
Cammie, you can only be a tease
if you stop sleepin' around, babe.

27:06.750 --> 27:09.170
Yeah. I keep forgetting that part.

27:11.080 --> 27:14.760
I'll have a shot of tequila, and don't
forget one for your pretty little self.

27:14.880 --> 27:18.310
Oh, thanks, but ever since
I got really drunk on tequila,

27:18.311 --> 27:20.140
I never drink the stuff anymore.

27:20.260 --> 27:23.430
Hey, Lil! Your new girl's
refusing your good booze.

27:23.510 --> 27:26.520
No! I was.. I was suggesting
this gentleman buy me a double.

27:26.600 --> 27:29.440
That's more like it.

27:33.070 --> 27:35.400
I need eight shots.

27:35.440 --> 27:39.700
Four Canadian, four South of the Border,
six-pack MGD and a double-blended back.

27:39.820 --> 27:42.570
- You want eight shots of what?
- I got it.

27:44.790 --> 27:46.660
Forty-six even, honey.

27:46.700 --> 27:48.580
Hey, Lil! Yo!

27:48.620 --> 27:51.670
Your Jersey girl can't quite keep up.

27:51.790 --> 27:54.290
Hey, gimme a Scotch and water.

27:54.420 --> 27:58.670
- Okay, you got it.
- Lil, do we serve water with our whiskey?

27:58.760 --> 28:01.340
Only water I serve's got
barley and hops in it!

28:01.390 --> 28:05.470
Hey, everybody! Do we
serve water in this bar?

28:05.510 --> 28:10.230
Hell, no. H20! Hell, no. H20!

28:15.770 --> 28:18.780
Hell no, H20!

28:25.370 --> 28:28.250
Sink or swim time, Jersey. Getup there!

28:28.290 --> 28:30.660
<i>The devil's in the
house of the rising sun</i>

28:32.120 --> 28:34.290
I can't do that dance.

28:35.840 --> 28:38.880
<i>Granny, does your dog bite No, child, no</i>

28:38.960 --> 28:41.130
Okay.

28:48.310 --> 28:53.150
- Here's some cash. You did okay for a nun.
- You're firing me?

28:53.190 --> 28:55.690
I told you this was an audition.

28:55.770 --> 28:58.320
Thanks for comin' in.
Now, get outta here.

28:58.400 --> 29:02.650
<i>Johnny said Devil, just come on
back if you ever wanna try again</i>

29:02.700 --> 29:05.570
<i>I done told you once you son of a
bitch, I'm the best there's ever been</i>

29:05.620 --> 29:07.780
<i>He played fire on the

29:09.200 --> 29:11.370
<i>Devil's in the house of the risin' sun</i>

29:11.460 --> 29:13.460
Please!

<i>- Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough

29:15.380 --> 29:17.540
Guys, guys, back off, back off!

29:17.590 --> 29:19.760
Look, the way I see
it, you got two choices.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.635
You can start a fight
here, throw some punches,

29:21.636 --> 29:23.470
get a bloody nose, make
fools of yourselves,

29:23.550 --> 29:27.550
or you can take this ten
bucks I got right here...

29:27.600 --> 29:30.180
and buy these two pretty
ladies a round at the bar.

29:30.220 --> 29:32.940
- Come on. What do you say?
- Let's go to the bar!

29:33.060 --> 29:36.360
Party!

29:36.400 --> 29:39.690
Hold it, Jersey. I'm just dyin'
to know where that came from.

29:39.780 --> 29:42.240
Try serving a beer and
pizza on Monday nights

29:42.541 --> 29:44.700
When the Giants play
the Cowboys in November.

29:44.780 --> 29:46.780
I'm giving you a second audition.

29:46.820 --> 29:51.370
There's a store at the corner of Sixth
and Hill. Be there at noon tomorrow.

29:51.450 --> 29:54.540
I'm sending my fashion coordinator
there to take you shopping.

29:54.620 --> 29:56.830
Now go home before I change my mind.

29:56.880 --> 30:01.170
Hey, and Jersey. I'd be shocked
if you survive another night.

30:01.260 --> 30:03.010
<i>Granny, will your dog bite No, child, no</i>

30:03.090 --> 30:05.630
Here we go!

30:05.680 --> 30:09.600
And left, and right, clog, clog, clog.

30:24.610 --> 30:25.700
Oh, yeah!

30:25.900 --> 30:30.700
So, uh, tell me more about this bar.

30:30.780 --> 30:35.790
- What kind of place is it?
- I don't know. It's just a bar, Dad.

30:35.870 --> 30:38.580
It's no big deal. What are you eating?

30:38.630 --> 30:44.340
One of those Lean Cuisine meals.
Rice and vegetables. Delicious.

30:44.420 --> 30:49.800
Oh! See, they're good. Right?

30:49.850 --> 30:53.140
So, well, what's going
on with your songwriting?

30:53.220 --> 30:56.060
Songwriting. Oh! He still has my tape.

30:56.140 --> 31:01.190
<i>Dance, dance, dance</i>

31:02.770 --> 31:04.740
<i>Dance</i>

31:04.780 --> 31:06.740
I want my tape.

31:06.820 --> 31:10.740
I had a feeling you'd be back to see me.

31:10.820 --> 31:13.580
- No dates in the kitchen, O'Donnell.
- I'm not staying.

31:13.660 --> 31:16.160
I just want my tape.

31:16.210 --> 31:18.710
Please.

31:18.830 --> 31:23.750
- Thanks. Bye.
- Did you really write all those songs?

31:26.010 --> 31:28.630
You listened to my tape?

31:28.720 --> 31:33.310
No, of course not. I mean, that
would be invasion of privacy.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.850
<i>Baby, you're the right kind of love</i>

31:35.930 --> 31:39.900
Go ahead, laugh it up. 'Cause there's
nothing you can say that's gonna bother me.

31:40.020 --> 31:42.310
I'm just trying to tell
you I like your music.

31:42.360 --> 31:45.320
I mean, do you always
take compliments so well?

31:47.360 --> 31:50.160
- I gotta go.
- Wait! Uh..

31:50.200 --> 31:53.080
I wanna see you again.
Where are you workin'?

31:54.830 --> 31:57.410
- I'm a Coyote.
- Good.

31:57.450 --> 31:58.185
And what the hell is that?

31:58.286 --> 32:01.920
If you want to see me
again, you'll figure it out.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.260
That good? Uh-huh.

32:10.430 --> 32:13.930
Sorry I'm late. Al
and I had a big fight.

32:14.010 --> 32:17.390
And then we made up. Twice.

32:18.640 --> 32:21.310
You're the fashion coordinator?

32:21.400 --> 32:25.270
Lil told me to get you something
that would make the kiddies drool.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.780
Trust me, Violet.

32:27.900 --> 32:31.030
I have a serious shopping problem.

32:32.160 --> 32:35.030
- It has a zipper... in the crotch.
- Yeah.

32:35.080 --> 32:38.250
Who'd wear that in public?

32:38.290 --> 32:40.540
<i>- Actually, I have it in blue.
- You're unbelievable</i>

32:44.290 --> 32:46.550
<i>You burden me with your problems</i>

32:46.590 --> 32:48.880
<i>By telling me more than mine</i>

32:48.960 --> 32:51.130
<i>I'm always so concerned</i>

32:51.180 --> 32:53.800
<i>With the way you say
you always have to stop</i>

32:53.840 --> 32:56.260
<i>To think of us being one</i>

32:56.310 --> 32:58.810
<i>Is more than I ever know</i>

32:58.930 --> 33:01.140
<i>The things you say</i>

33:01.190 --> 33:03.400
<i>You're unbelievable</i>

33:22.960 --> 33:26.590
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

33:26.790 --> 33:29.920
<i>Seemingly last less
Don't mean you can ask us</i>

33:48.190 --> 33:50.730
<i>You're unbelievable, oh</i>

33:55.450 --> 33:59.080
Here I am! Yeah, baby!

33:59.160 --> 34:02.160
<i>You're unbelievable</i>

34:04.670 --> 34:06.920
Come on! Knock it
- Hey! Knock it off!

34:07.040 --> 34:09.800
Lil! The ice!

34:11.800 --> 34:14.679
How do you like that, huh?

34:17.590 --> 34:22.600
<i>There's every good reason</i>

34:22.679 --> 34:25.350
I don't know how you guys do
it. I can't have another drink.

34:25.389 --> 34:28.480
Next time that guy buys you
a shot.. That's on me, honey.

34:28.560 --> 34:30.570
Chase it with a beer.

34:33.239 --> 34:36.409
- I don't get it.
- I don't swallow it.

34:36.530 --> 34:39.320
I just spit the shot back into the
beer bottle. They'll never know.

34:39.449 --> 34:41.330
You try it.

34:41.449 --> 34:44.909
Hey, just keep an eye
on your spittoon bottle.

34:44.960 --> 34:49.540
Once Rachel served hers to
Lou by accident. Huge drama.

34:49.590 --> 34:52.500
Cammie, I think I just
fell in love with you.

34:52.630 --> 34:55.590
Oh, Violet! I'm not a lesbian.

34:55.670 --> 34:58.140
I've played in the
minors, but never went pro.

34:59.760 --> 35:01.760
- Th-That's not what I
meant. - What are you doing?

35:01.850 --> 35:05.810
Lil's starin' straight at you. Come on.
Grab this guy. Make yourself look busy.

35:05.890 --> 35:10.270
- Hi. You look like you could use a shot.
- No, I'm waiting on Lil.

35:10.310 --> 35:14.440
Sorry. It's a no parking zone. If you
wanna sit here, you gotta order a drink.

35:14.480 --> 35:18.160
- Okay. Gimme a glass of water.
- Okay.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.780
- He just ordered water.
- Yeah.

35:20.820 --> 35:23.240
You know what to do.

35:26.460 --> 35:30.830
Testing. Um, hey, everybody,
this guy just ordered water.

35:30.880 --> 35:33.550
Do we serve water in our bar?

35:33.670 --> 35:38.090
Hell, no! H20!

35:39.590 --> 35:42.470
Jersey! No!

35:42.550 --> 35:44.720
It's okay, Lil! Nobody
orders water in your bar!

35:44.770 --> 35:48.730
He can order whatever he
wants. He's the fire marshal.

35:50.400 --> 35:52.060
Hey, Mike, I'm so sorry. She's new.

35:52.150 --> 35:55.980
I'm okay. Let's step outside.

35:57.440 --> 35:59.950
<i>- Party
- Nice knowing you, Jersey.</i>

36:00.070 --> 36:03.950
<i>- Get naked
- Come on, you guys! Let me hear you!</i>

36:06.910 --> 36:09.040
You okay?

36:09.120 --> 36:11.420
Who am I kidding? I can't do this.

36:11.540 --> 36:13.460
Of course you can. Now cheer up,

36:13.540 --> 36:17.050
because there's a really cute
guy at the bar asking for you.

36:17.130 --> 36:19.170
Somebody's asking for me?

36:19.220 --> 36:23.100
He says his name is Mr. O'Donnell.

36:25.010 --> 36:26.970
He's hot.

36:34.270 --> 36:37.900
Jersey. The fire marshal
threatened to shut me down.

36:37.990 --> 36:40.240
- He let me go with a $250 fine.
- Lil, I'm really sorry..

36:40.360 --> 36:44.580
I'll make you a deal. You figure
out a way to make me 250 tonight,

36:44.620 --> 36:46.910
I'll let you come back tomorrow.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.450
Great.

36:50.710 --> 36:53.330
So much for sweet and innocent.

36:53.380 --> 36:55.100
So, you found me.

36:55.101 --> 36:58.420
Some guys at work told me
where I could look for Coyotes.

36:58.460 --> 37:02.130
Well, take a good look, because tonight's
my last night. I think I'm gonna get fired.

37:02.180 --> 37:05.390
- Why?
- I have to make $250 in two hours.

37:05.510 --> 37:07.430
It's completely impossible.

37:10.020 --> 37:13.100
Here's nine dollars, just
to get you started. Okay?

37:13.150 --> 37:16.060
I always like to help a friend in need.

37:19.150 --> 37:21.320
Why are you looking at me like that?

37:21.400 --> 37:24.620
Kevin, I don't want your money.

37:27.530 --> 37:30.700
All right, uh, listen up. Ladies.

37:30.750 --> 37:33.330
The bidding will start at $25...

37:33.370 --> 37:35.250
for one night only.

37:35.330 --> 37:39.210
You get this: Purebred, housebroken,

37:39.250 --> 37:42.880
fully trained, yowling stud.

37:42.930 --> 37:45.800
- No way.
- That's pretty cheap.

37:45.840 --> 37:47.760
Violet, what are you doing?

37:47.800 --> 37:50.520
You said you wanted to
help, so... turn around, sir,

37:50.640 --> 37:53.390
let 'em take a look at ya.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.150
Why are you doing this to me?

37:55.190 --> 37:59.150
It's payback time, Mr. O'Donnell.

37:59.230 --> 38:00.980
Now, turn around.

38:02.030 --> 38:04.660
No, God, no. Don't do this.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.740
Go on, show 'em what you've got.

38:06.820 --> 38:09.030
Are you in? Do you wanna do this?

38:09.160 --> 38:11.500
- All right, ladies. What'll you give me?
- I've got twenty bucks.

38:13.910 --> 38:16.670
I've got $25 right here.

38:16.750 --> 38:18.460
Make it 35!

38:20.090 --> 38:22.210
Thirty-five dollars!

38:23.670 --> 38:26.590
- Forty dollars!
- Get.. What are you doing?

38:26.640 --> 38:30.060
- Come on, girls, fifty?
- Fifty!

38:30.100 --> 38:33.020
- Sixty-one dollars.
- I've got 70.

38:33.140 --> 38:35.890
- Come on, girls. Seventy-five?
- Seventy-five dollars!

38:35.940 --> 38:39.820
Eighty dollars! Come
on, girls. Do I hear 85?

38:39.940 --> 38:43.440
Ninety! Ninety-five dollars!

38:43.490 --> 38:46.860
One hundred dollars!

38:49.830 --> 38:52.240
- That's it.
- You wanna come home with Mama?

38:52.370 --> 38:55.790
Whoa! Nice!

38:55.870 --> 38:58.080
Oh, yeah!

38:58.130 --> 39:00.500
That's my boy.

39:00.540 --> 39:03.550
- Oh, yeah. Shake it, shake it.
- $125 back here!

39:03.670 --> 39:07.890
$140, right here. Come on, come on.

39:11.850 --> 39:15.890
My goodness, girls, come on. One
fifty and you'll see the butt.

39:15.930 --> 39:18.560
Come on, girls. You
can do better than this.

39:18.600 --> 39:20.940
One seventy-five.

39:20.980 --> 39:22.110
Yeah!

39:22.190 --> 39:25.860
There we go. Two hundred dollars!

39:30.120 --> 39:33.080
- You've got215righthere!
- Two hundred and fifty dollars.

39:33.160 --> 39:36.250
Sold, for $250!

39:39.290 --> 39:42.750
Come on up, honey. He's yours.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.170
Damn you!

39:47.220 --> 39:49.840
The blonde would have gone 275.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.810
Come with me.

39:53.930 --> 39:58.940
You're gonna owe me big-time
for this one. That's 250 even.

40:01.860 --> 40:05.480
Mmm. Mmm! Oh.

40:08.950 --> 40:13.830
<i>I'm gonna see ya I'm gonna
meet ya, meet ya meet ya one day</i>

40:13.910 --> 40:16.750
<i>Maybe next week I'm gonna meet ya</i>

40:16.870 --> 40:19.290
<i>I'll meet ya I'll meet ya</i>

40:19.370 --> 40:21.330
Better close out, girls.

40:21.380 --> 40:23.590
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

40:23.710 --> 40:27.670
What does "Coyote Ugly" mean?

40:29.930 --> 40:32.140
Did you ever wake up sober
after a one night stand...

40:32.260 --> 40:35.310
and the person you're next to is layin'
on your arm, and they're so ugly...

40:35.430 --> 40:37.470
you'd rather chew off your
arm than risk wakin' them?

40:37.520 --> 40:40.640
- That's coyote ugly.
- Let's go, ladies.

40:40.690 --> 40:43.730
Well, why would you name your
bar after something like that?

40:43.810 --> 40:46.530
Well, because "Cheers" was taken.

40:46.570 --> 40:48.530
Cabs are out front.

40:48.690 --> 40:50.860
- You're rich, Jersey.
- See ya.

40:50.900 --> 40:53.240
Yeah. Good night.

40:53.320 --> 40:57.870
The woman who purchased me is named Sandy
Rosenfeld, a divorcee with three grown kids,

40:57.950 --> 41:01.790
a passion for long walks and short-haired
hunting dogs and Italian opera.

41:01.870 --> 41:06.420
Her ex-husband is a C.P.A. Her
favorite artist is Van Gogh,

41:06.500 --> 41:11.630
and her New Year's resolution is to lose
15 pounds.. and to see Barbra in concert.

41:11.720 --> 41:14.550
Okay. I owe you.

41:14.600 --> 41:17.060
What do you want?

41:17.180 --> 41:20.560
Well, it's 3:30 in the morning.
I want what every man wants.

41:21.890 --> 41:24.230
Breakfast.

41:24.310 --> 41:27.440
And that's it? I go to breakfast
with you, and we're even?

41:27.520 --> 41:30.570
No. We're not even close to
even, because I danced on a bar,

41:30.650 --> 41:34.070
I took off my shirt,
and I unzipped my pants.

41:34.110 --> 41:37.950
Okay. Let's make a deal.
Breakfast and lunch.

41:38.040 --> 41:41.960
- Breakfast, lunch and two dinners.
- That's four dates!

41:42.080 --> 41:44.830
Yep. Which would make it the second
longest relationship I've ever had.

41:44.880 --> 41:47.255
Get in the car.

41:47.290 --> 41:51.840
Oh, I hate to spoil your evening, but it
looks like we're not gonna go anywhere.

41:55.180 --> 41:57.300
Oh, my God.

42:00.140 --> 42:02.020
It's hard to find parking in New York.

42:02.140 --> 42:04.940
You ever eaten Turkish?
This is the place.

42:05.060 --> 42:07.770
- Hey. How you doin'?
- Hi, Kevin.

42:07.810 --> 42:10.610
- Four of the regular?
- Sure, yeah. Hey.

42:10.650 --> 42:14.450
- Hey, Kevin. How are you, man?
- How you doin', man? Good.

42:14.530 --> 42:17.160
Here it is, man. Flown in from Miami.

42:17.280 --> 42:19.790
- Check out the merchandise.
- Hey, man, no. I trust you.

42:19.910 --> 42:21.910
All right, all right.

42:25.790 --> 42:29.290
Look, uh, I don't know
what you're into, but..

42:29.420 --> 42:34.340
The Amazing Spider-Man,
number 129, mint condition.

42:34.420 --> 42:37.010
- Worth a thousand bucks.
- A comic book.

42:37.090 --> 42:40.510
No, it's not just a comic book. This
is the first appearance of the Punisher.

42:40.545 --> 42:42.980
This is the holy grail of comic books.

42:43.020 --> 42:45.850
You collect comic books. That's so cute.

42:45.890 --> 42:50.190
It's not cute. It's
very rugged and manly.

42:50.270 --> 42:54.320
- It's just a bit kinky. Huh?
- I think it's sweet.

42:57.360 --> 43:01.030
So, do you always eat breakfast
on the hood of your car?

43:01.080 --> 43:03.000
What can I say? I'm a romantic.

43:03.120 --> 43:06.290
You think this is romantic?

43:06.370 --> 43:09.500
Well, you may not be feeling
it now, but I think one day...

43:09.590 --> 43:13.420
you'll be on stage singing
a song about this very night.

43:13.460 --> 43:16.300
"When We Were Downwind
From a Trash Barge. "

43:16.380 --> 43:18.300
Yeah. Catchy title. Hum a few bars.

43:20.850 --> 43:24.470
Sorry to disappoint you, but
I'm a songwriter, not a singer.

43:24.520 --> 43:27.140
When I get on stage, I freeze.

43:27.270 --> 43:30.810
What if the fate of the free
world rested on your voice?

43:30.860 --> 43:34.280
Okay. If the fate of the free
world depended on me singing,

43:34.400 --> 43:36.450
maybe.

43:36.490 --> 43:39.360
All I ever really wanted
is to sit in the dark...

43:39.490 --> 43:43.200
and hear someone great singing my songs.

43:43.240 --> 43:45.200
I wanna be the one who writes the music.

43:47.920 --> 43:51.080
I remember the first time my mother
played me "Bridge Over Troubled Water"...

43:51.210 --> 43:54.510
by Simon and Garfunkel.

43:54.550 --> 43:57.130
I remember exactly what she was wearing.

43:57.170 --> 44:02.510
I remember exactly how her hair
smelled. I remember exactly how I felt.

44:02.550 --> 44:05.430
And every time I hear that song,

44:05.470 --> 44:09.060
I remember exactly
what she was wearing...

44:09.140 --> 44:11.730
and exactly how her hair smelled...

44:11.810 --> 44:13.940
and exactly how I felt.

44:14.980 --> 44:17.740
'Cause the great songs last forever.

44:17.820 --> 44:21.990
- So, what's the problem?
- Well...

44:22.070 --> 44:24.790
now they're telling me the only
way to get my songs heard...

44:24.910 --> 44:27.040
is to go out there and sing 'em myself.

44:27.160 --> 44:30.210
So we're gonna have to try fix
this little problem straight away.

44:30.330 --> 44:32.290
Hmm. And how do you propose we do that?

44:32.330 --> 44:34.800
Well, is there any place
you feel comfortable singing?

44:36.380 --> 44:39.170
- The shower.
- We'll start there.

44:39.220 --> 44:42.800
I mean, I don't care how long it takes, how
many hours we have to spend in that shower.

44:42.850 --> 44:46.220
- Let's get to it.
- Okay. Before we hit the showers,

44:46.270 --> 44:49.100
maybe you could tell me a
little something about yourself.

44:49.140 --> 44:51.310
Oh, really? What do you wanna know?

44:51.400 --> 44:53.400
What part of Australia are you from?

44:53.520 --> 44:56.400
I'm from all over. My
family moved around a lot.

44:56.480 --> 44:58.190
So the rest of your family
doesn't live in New York?

44:58.240 --> 44:59.950
Do you always ask this many questions?

45:00.070 --> 45:02.320
Do you always dodge this many questions?

45:02.360 --> 45:05.530
You can at least tell me where you got all
the moves you pulled on the bar tonight.

45:05.580 --> 45:08.160
Well, if I told you,
I'd have to kill you.

45:08.250 --> 45:13.000
That's original.

45:13.080 --> 45:15.460
The sun's coming up.
We're gonna be late.

45:15.540 --> 45:17.630
Late? Late for what?

45:20.340 --> 45:23.430
This is incredible.

45:23.510 --> 45:25.240
Look at that fish!

45:25.241 --> 45:26.970
All right. Put this on.
You're gonna need it.

45:27.010 --> 45:29.600
Why? What are you talking about?

45:29.680 --> 45:32.350
You're gonna help me
unload the next bin.

45:32.390 --> 45:35.150
- You're joking, right?
- No. It's not that bad, Vi.

45:35.270 --> 45:38.280
- I do it all the time.
- Exactly how many jobs do you have?

45:38.400 --> 45:41.150
Tuesday through
Saturday, I'm at the club.

45:41.200 --> 45:43.990
Sunday and Monday I
park cars at the plaza.

45:44.070 --> 45:46.950
I've been a telemarketer. Would
you like to switch to AT&T?

45:47.030 --> 45:52.000
And for six terrifying hours I
delivered phonebooks in Queens.

45:52.120 --> 45:54.500
Don't forget your
extensive work in fish.

45:54.580 --> 45:57.540
This is an expensive city,
and these guys pay cash.

45:57.670 --> 46:00.420
I don't care if they pay in lobster. I'm
not sticking my hands in that fishy bin.

46:00.460 --> 46:03.430
I was gonna split the money with you.

46:03.550 --> 46:05.340
- A hundred bucks apiece.
- A hundred bucks?

46:05.430 --> 46:08.600
- Wait, wait. Why didn't you say so?
- Thanks, Dan.

46:08.720 --> 46:10.180
- You're not ready, are you? Fifty bucks.
- Wait. No.

46:10.220 --> 46:12.940
- Twenty-five, ten.
Ready? - Okay. Uh-huh.

46:12.980 --> 46:15.850
Ooh! That's disgusting.

46:15.900 --> 46:20.320
Hey, you'll hurt their feelings.
Okay. Just on top of the other fish.

46:22.690 --> 46:26.810
So, I know I just met
you a few days ago.

46:27.011 --> 46:28.330
There's something I have to tell you.

46:30.290 --> 46:32.850
You smell really bad.

46:33.751 --> 46:35.411
Well, so do you.

46:35.412 --> 46:39.040
I mean, I was gonna kiss you good-bye,
but, um, I thought I might gag.

46:39.090 --> 46:41.300
You're a real charmer.

46:44.470 --> 46:46.390
Okay. Good night.

46:46.510 --> 46:48.390
Good morning.

47:07.110 --> 47:08.780
Don't look at me like that.

47:14.450 --> 47:16.620
Spend it.

47:22.670 --> 47:27.180
- What are you doing here?
- I changed my mind about this kiss.

47:27.300 --> 47:30.600
I think we should give it a shot.

47:38.020 --> 47:41.320
Well, have a nice day.

47:44.030 --> 47:45.940
"Have a nice day"?

47:46.070 --> 47:50.280
Yeah. I panicked. I didn't
know what else to say.

47:53.870 --> 47:55.750
Have a nice day.

48:01.500 --> 48:04.250
All right. Back of the line
over here. Back of the line.

48:28.200 --> 48:31.160
Yeah, I like it!

48:31.280 --> 48:34.790
- Hey, baby!
- Make a hole. Make a hole!

48:34.830 --> 48:35.675
Shit, the cops are here.

48:35.676 --> 48:38.120
Nobody else gets in
here. Look at this place.

48:38.210 --> 48:42.000
Hey, Lil. I'm sorry. There's nothing we
can do here. You're 50 people over max.

48:42.040 --> 48:44.550
They're trying to shut us down.

48:44.590 --> 48:47.710
Let's go outside and
talk. I'll take care of it.

48:51.050 --> 48:54.760
This is not a gas pump, son!

48:54.810 --> 48:57.020
Wait your turn!

49:00.440 --> 49:03.060
- Hey, no pictures, man!
- Hey, I'm a reporter from The Voice.

49:07.990 --> 49:10.070
What are you doing? Hey!

49:10.150 --> 49:12.070
Put me down!

49:12.110 --> 49:13.370
- Put me down!
- Cammie!

49:13.490 --> 49:15.830
- Help!
- Come on! Let her go!

49:15.910 --> 49:18.000
Rachel, help!

49:18.040 --> 49:22.750
Come on! Break it up!

49:22.830 --> 49:25.130
- Lou, where's Rachel and Cammie?
- I don't know!

49:30.090 --> 49:31.840
Let me go!

49:47.270 --> 49:51.610
Jersey, they're tearing
this place apart!

49:57.700 --> 50:02.620
<i>- Rachel! Rachel!
- One way or another I'm gonna find ya</i>

50:02.660 --> 50:05.540
<i>- I'm gonna get ya, get ya get ya, get ya
- Let me go!</i>

50:05.580 --> 50:08.920
<i>One way or another I'm gonna get ya</i>

50:09.000 --> 50:11.010
<i>I'm gonna get ya, get ya get ya, get ya</i>

50:11.130 --> 50:14.680
<i>One way or another I'm gonna see ya</i>

50:14.800 --> 50:17.800
<i>I'm gonna meet ya, meet ya
meet ya, meet ya, one day</i>

50:17.850 --> 50:21.480
<i>Maybe next week I'm gonna meet ya</i>

50:21.600 --> 50:23.390
<i>I'll meet ya, I'll meet ya</i>

50:23.440 --> 50:25.770
<i>I will</i>

50:25.850 --> 50:29.690
<i>Drive past your house</i>

50:29.780 --> 50:34.660
<i>And if the lights are all out</i>

50:34.700 --> 50:39.708
<i>I'll see who's around</i>

50:40.710 --> 50:43.208
<i>One way or another</i>

50:43.359 --> 50:44.169
<i>I'm gonna find ya</i>

50:44.689 --> 50:47.209
<i>I'm gonna get ya, get ya
get ya, get ya, one way</i>

50:47.290 --> 50:50.549
<i>- I'm talking about that!
- Or another I'm gonna win ya</i>

50:50.670 --> 50:52.589
<i>I'm gonna get ya I'll get ya</i>

50:52.670 --> 50:55.759
<i>One way or another I'm gonna see ya</i>

50:55.840 --> 50:58.720
<i>I'm gonna meet ya,
meet ya meet ya, meet ya</i>

50:58.800 --> 51:00.931
<i>One day, maybe next week</i>

51:01.020 --> 51:03.431
<i>I'm gonna meet ya I'll meet ya</i>

51:03.481 --> 51:06.730
- Great. Yeah.
- Last call, Lil.

51:06.811 --> 51:09.941
- Start clearin' 'em out.
- You got it.

51:10.021 --> 51:12.861
Let's go.

51:12.942 --> 51:17.282
<i>One way or another I'm gonna lose ya</i>

51:17.371 --> 51:20.743
<i>I'm gonna give you the
slip A slip of the hip</i>

51:20.792 --> 51:24.963
<i>Or another, I'm gonna
lose ya I'm gonna trick ya</i>

51:25.042 --> 51:27.583
<i>One way or another</i>

51:27.633 --> 51:31.003
<i>I'm gonna lose ya I'm gonna trick
ya, trick ya trick ya, trick ya</i>

51:35.383 --> 51:39.013
Did you see their faces? I mean, wow.

51:39.104 --> 51:42.564
They all wanted you,
honey. Even the girls.

51:42.684 --> 51:45.065
Not a dry seat in the house.

51:45.144 --> 51:49.024
You guys, that was, like,
a one-time performance..

51:49.065 --> 51:51.115
That I have to repeat,
like, every night.

51:53.485 --> 51:57.206
She sang along with a jukebox.
Let's not start polishing a Grammy.

51:57.325 --> 52:00.786
Oh, come on, Rach. She
saved your butt. Admit it.

52:00.835 --> 52:04.796
No. She saved me from kicking the
shit out of a couple of drunks.

52:04.916 --> 52:07.586
- That's it. Ooh.
- Ooh, that was good.

52:09.387 --> 52:11.597
- Where you goin'?
- I don't know.

52:11.717 --> 52:14.467
I gotta walk or celebrate or..

52:14.517 --> 52:18.057
Ugh, pass out or something.

52:18.137 --> 52:20.518
Hey, ladies and gents,

52:20.597 --> 52:24.477
how about a big round of applause
for the singing Coyote from Jersey!

52:24.528 --> 52:27.358
- So I'm a Coyote?
- Five nights a week.

52:38.249 --> 52:41.249
Hey, what is it? What's wrong?

52:41.330 --> 52:43.254
Why would anything be wrong?

52:43.289 --> 52:48.090
Um, you called me in the middle of the
night and said there was an emergency.

52:50.550 --> 52:52.471
What was that for?

52:52.550 --> 52:55.641
I had a good night. I
wanted a good-night kiss.

52:55.720 --> 52:58.270
Well, wait a second.
Where are you going?

52:58.391 --> 53:01.311
Have a nice day, Mr. O'Donnell.

53:01.351 --> 53:03.312
"Have a nice day"?

53:10.072 --> 53:12.992
<i>Right kind of wrong</i>

53:15.283 --> 53:17.912
<i>Right kind of wrong</i>

53:17.953 --> 53:20.663
<i>We likes to party
La-la-di-da-di</i>

53:23.173 --> 53:27.134
<i>On the East Coast is the place to be</i>

53:32.934 --> 53:35.605
<i>We likes to party
La-la-di-da-di</i>

53:35.724 --> 53:37.775
<i>Lovin' you</i>

53:37.814 --> 53:43.065
<i>Isn't really something I should do</i>

53:43.105 --> 53:47.025
<i>I should try to be strong</i>

53:48.236 --> 53:52.456
<i>Isn't really something I should do</i>

53:54.126 --> 53:57.746
<i>Shouldn't want to spend my time with you</i>

53:58.747 --> 54:02.927
<i>I should try to be strong</i>

54:02.967 --> 54:06.467
<i>But, baby, you're the
right kind of wrong</i>

54:08.218 --> 54:10.427
<i>Baby, you're the right kind of wrong</i>

54:12.977 --> 54:16.228
What's going on? Why
do we need my guitar?

54:16.308 --> 54:19.068
You'll find out soon
enough. No. This way.

54:19.189 --> 54:23.069
Okay, now there's a seat.

54:23.148 --> 54:25.279
Just there.

54:27.318 --> 54:29.409
Take a look.

54:29.489 --> 54:32.459
Your fans wanna hear you sing.

54:33.909 --> 54:37.840
I told you. I can't sing
my own songs. I never could.

54:37.880 --> 54:42.470
Well, that's too bad, because
they've requested to hear your songs.

54:42.511 --> 54:45.300
Be gentle on the keyboard.
I borrowed it from the club.

54:47.391 --> 54:50.011
You did all this just to help me sing?

54:50.061 --> 54:54.101
I thought maybe we could cure that
stage fright I've heard so much about.

54:54.191 --> 54:56.901
Kevin, I wish you could.

54:57.022 --> 54:59.611
Come on, let me try.

54:59.732 --> 55:01.781
Tell me what it feels like.

55:06.612 --> 55:09.373
You really wanna know?

55:09.452 --> 55:11.412
Yeah.

55:13.623 --> 55:15.583
You asked for it.

55:15.624 --> 55:17.794
What are you doing?

55:19.294 --> 55:23.884
The only way I can show you...

55:25.474 --> 55:27.594
is to make you...

55:27.644 --> 55:31.765
really... nervous.

55:34.025 --> 55:37.855
The first thing that happens...

55:37.946 --> 55:41.525
is my heart starts to race.

55:45.956 --> 55:48.286
Good.

55:48.326 --> 55:51.087
Racing heart. Yep.

55:51.127 --> 55:53.417
- Got it.
- And then...

55:53.496 --> 55:58.127
my entire body starts shaking.

56:00.847 --> 56:04.717
Shaking body. I'm getting that. Yeah.

56:04.808 --> 56:06.728
And...

56:08.438 --> 56:11.808
then everything gets... a bit...

56:13.818 --> 56:16.648
cloudy.

56:17.858 --> 56:20.409
Clouds are definitely rolling in.

56:22.529 --> 56:24.910
Then I start...

56:24.989 --> 56:27.829
Losing control.

56:29.290 --> 56:32.000
Well, how long does this usually last?

56:32.080 --> 56:35.630
Oh, it's been known to last all night.

56:36.840 --> 56:40.681
- That must be horrible.
- It's excruciating.

57:25.815 --> 57:31.146
I think that audience got more
than they paid for, really.

57:34.565 --> 57:36.906
What's "L.M.S." stand for?

57:36.946 --> 57:39.406
Lynn Marie Sanford.

57:39.447 --> 57:42.156
It was my mom's guitar.

57:42.206 --> 57:44.167
She died five years ago.

57:44.287 --> 57:47.337
She moved to New York to be
a singer when she was my age.

57:47.457 --> 57:49.957
She came pretty close to the big time.

57:50.007 --> 57:52.968
Well, what happened?

57:53.088 --> 57:55.258
She hated the stage.

57:55.298 --> 57:58.758
She said it was the
scariest place in the world.

57:58.808 --> 58:00.768
Sounds familiar.

58:04.439 --> 58:07.568
You really want me to sing?

58:07.609 --> 58:10.359
Just tell me what I have to do.

58:18.029 --> 58:19.740
Disappear.

58:21.250 --> 58:25.040
All right. No problem.

58:48.812 --> 58:52.403
<i>I don't like to</i>

58:52.492 --> 58:55.453
<i>Be alone in the night</i>

58:55.573 --> 58:58.163
<i>I don't like to</i>

58:58.283 --> 59:01.333
<i>Hear I'm wrong when I'm right</i>

59:01.453 --> 59:04.463
<i>And I don't like to</i>

59:04.504 --> 59:06.424
<i>Have the rain on my shoes</i>

59:06.464 --> 59:10.904
<i>But I do love you</i>

59:10.939 --> 59:15.345
<i>But I do love</i>

59:15.425 --> 59:17.845
<i>You</i>

59:19.515 --> 59:22.316
<i>I don't like to</i>

59:22.435 --> 59:25.396
<i>See a sky painted grey</i>

59:25.435 --> 59:28.606
<i>And I don't like when</i>

59:28.656 --> 59:31.236
<i>Nothing's going my way</i>

59:31.276 --> 59:36.956
<i>And I don't like to be the
one with the blues but I do</i>

59:37.037 --> 59:39.827
If you wanna write a song. If you
want to be like a serious songwriter,

59:39.877 --> 59:41.788
you simply gotta go with the Mac.

59:41.837 --> 59:45.257
Laptop. You can lay your tracks
down on a blank CD, and you're done.

59:45.377 --> 59:48.587
Do you.. Do you have a payment plan?

59:48.628 --> 59:50.968
<i>The way you lay your head upon</i>

59:51.048 --> 59:53.758
<i>- Play ball! Let's go!
- My shoulder when you sleep</i>

59:55.218 --> 59:57.639
Come on, Cammie!

01:00:00.228 --> 01:00:03.189
<i>Oh, I do</i>

01:00:05.029 --> 01:00:07.149
<i>And I don't like to</i>

01:00:07.189 --> 01:00:09.610
<i>Hear I'm wrong when I'm right</i>

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:13.280
<i>And I don't like to</i>

01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:15.290
<i>Have the rain on my shoes</i>

01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:20.621
<i>But I do love you</i>

01:00:27.211 --> 01:00:29.181
What are you doing?

01:00:31.141 --> 01:00:33.221
What are you, brain damaged?

01:00:33.302 --> 01:00:36.972
You know what kind of maniacs we got driving
through here? They don't stop for nothin'.

01:00:37.022 --> 01:00:39.692
- Whose boat?
- I borrowed it from a friend.

01:00:39.733 --> 01:00:41.903
Looks like a guy's car to me.

01:00:41.982 --> 01:00:43.287
How can you tell?

01:00:43.288 --> 01:00:47.192
I've been staring at cars
every day for the last 16 years.

01:00:47.233 --> 01:00:49.453
- Who is he?
- He's a friend.

01:00:49.573 --> 01:00:51.704
Look, I brought you a turkey
sandwich, no mayo, extra sprouts.

01:00:51.823 --> 01:00:54.284
Thank you. Great.

01:00:54.333 --> 01:00:58.124
I'm starvin'. Now
tell me about this bar.

01:00:58.204 --> 01:01:00.664
Is it a bunch of bankers
havin' martinis after work?

01:01:00.715 --> 01:01:02.924
I gotta go. Look. I love you.

01:01:03.045 --> 01:01:05.425
I love you too. Be careful.

01:01:05.504 --> 01:01:08.674
Hey, do I come to your
office and honk? Come on!

01:01:12.555 --> 01:01:14.450
I got you a gig.

01:01:14.551 --> 01:01:18.145
There's this club where a lot of music
people hang out called the Elbow Room.

01:01:18.226 --> 01:01:23.357
My friend's the manager. He owes me a
favor, and you're it, next Thursday night.

01:01:23.486 --> 01:01:25.697
Are you forgetting
about the stage fright?

01:01:25.776 --> 01:01:28.286
Uh, what about the bar?

01:01:28.327 --> 01:01:31.787
Come on, Kevin. All I do is
sing along with the jukebox.

01:01:31.867 --> 01:01:36.587
See? You're making progress. A few more
nights at my place, and you'll be cured.

01:01:36.627 --> 01:01:41.258
I hate to burst your bubble, but
I'll never be cured. It's genetic.

01:01:41.378 --> 01:01:45.088
Stage fright DNA. Yes, I
saw that on E.R. Last week.

01:01:45.139 --> 01:01:49.009
Okay. Laugh all you want, but my mom
couldn't do it, and neither can I.

01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:51.849
So was your mother afraid to try?

01:01:51.889 --> 01:01:55.399
Look, I just wanna be a song writer.
Why won't you give up on this?

01:01:55.519 --> 01:01:59.019
Because I've been giving up on people my
entire life, and it's a nasty little habit.

01:01:59.054 --> 01:02:01.860
So, you're gonna sing
at the club, or I'll..

01:02:01.899 --> 01:02:04.410
Or you'll what?

01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:07.281
I'll never kiss you again.

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.491
That sounds like a
threat, Mr. O'Donnell.

01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:11.750
Well, let's just say...

01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:14.871
it's gonna be quite a long, cold winter.

01:02:14.961 --> 01:02:17.131
That's supposed to convince me?

01:02:17.251 --> 01:02:20.711
It's working, isn't it?
Your knees are getting weak.

01:02:20.762 --> 01:02:23.842
- I'll think about it.
- Try again.

01:02:23.922 --> 01:02:26.142
Uh, I'll see if I can get off work.

01:02:26.182 --> 01:02:28.352
You're gettin' warmer.

01:02:28.432 --> 01:02:31.892
All right. You win. I'll do it.

01:02:31.933 --> 01:02:33.933
Oh, I love winning.

01:02:34.103 --> 01:02:38.613
<i>Pour some sugar on me</i>

01:02:40.193 --> 01:02:43.193
<i>- Pour your sugar on me
- Hey, we have a special treat...</i>

01:02:43.244 --> 01:02:45.153
for you tonight, boys and girls.

01:02:45.203 --> 01:02:48.074
<i>- Look who dropped by for a visit.
- Pour some sugar on me</i>

01:02:50.534 --> 01:02:54.664
I'm a paying customer tonight. I have
class in the morning. What are you doing?

01:02:54.714 --> 01:02:57.834
Come on, Zoe!

01:02:57.885 --> 01:03:00.465
Zoe! Zoe! Zoe! Zoe!

01:03:05.635 --> 01:03:10.106
Time to get wet, girls. Whoa!

01:03:10.226 --> 01:03:13.396
<i>Well, I'm packing up my game
and I'm gonna head out West</i>

01:03:13.476 --> 01:03:16.237
<i>Where real women come equipped
with scripts and fake breasts</i>

01:03:16.316 --> 01:03:19.567
<i>Find a nest in the
hills Chill like Flynt</i>

01:03:19.616 --> 01:03:22.947
<i>Buy an old drop top Find a spot to pimp</i>

01:03:22.987 --> 01:03:25.157
<i>- Well, I'm a real kid and I'm a real McCoy
- Who wants some of this?</i>

01:03:25.198 --> 01:03:30.837
<i>And I'm headed out West sucker,
because I wannabe a cowboy, baby</i>

01:03:30.957 --> 01:03:33.878
<i>With the top let back
and the sunshine shining</i>

01:03:33.958 --> 01:03:36.918
<i>Cowboy, baby</i>

01:03:36.968 --> 01:03:39.679
<i>Ridin' at night 'cause I sleep all day</i>

01:03:39.798 --> 01:03:43.429
- Excuse me, does Violet Sanford work here?
- Yeah, she's on the bar.

01:03:43.509 --> 01:03:45.429
- She's on what?
- She's on the bar.

01:03:45.468 --> 01:03:48.439
What do you guys say?

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.980
<i>Yeah, Kid Rock You can call me Tex</i>

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:57.190
<i>Rollin' sunset woman
with a bottle of Becks</i>

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.161
<i>Seen as limmy in a 'vette
Rolled down my glass</i>

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:02.620
<i>And said, "Yeah, this dick's
fittin' right in your ass"</i>

01:04:02.701 --> 01:04:05.950
<i>I'm flickin' my Bic up
and down that coast and</i>

01:04:06.001 --> 01:04:08.371
<i>- Keep on truckin' till it falls into motion
- Dad! Wait!</i>

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:12.591
<i>- Cowboy
- Dad, it's not as bad as it looks.</i>

01:04:12.632 --> 01:04:16.382
<i>- And the sunshine shining
- Daddy, it's not as bad as it looks.</i>

01:04:16.462 --> 01:04:17.921
I just sing here every night.

01:04:17.972 --> 01:04:21.092
- People come here to see me.
- Cowboy!

01:04:21.142 --> 01:04:22.892
Say something!

01:04:22.893 --> 01:04:25.643
The guys are putting your
picture up in their booths!

01:04:25.722 --> 01:04:29.603
- I gotta go, get up early.
- Dad, it's just a bar.

01:04:29.643 --> 01:04:32.653
- You can trust me.
- But you're my daughter.

01:04:34.063 --> 01:04:37.403
<i>I can smell a pig from a mile away</i>

01:04:37.494 --> 01:04:40.154
<i>Cowboy</i>

01:04:40.204 --> 01:04:43.034
<i>With the top let back
and the sunshine shining</i>

01:04:43.074 --> 01:04:50.335
<i>Cowboy</i>

01:04:50.415 --> 01:04:53.005
Hi, you've reached Bill Sanford.

01:04:53.085 --> 01:04:57.175
Please leave a message
when you hear the beep.

01:04:57.256 --> 01:05:00.426
Dad, you can't avoid me
for the rest of your life.

01:05:00.476 --> 01:05:02.621
I have to come over and do your laundry.

01:05:02.622 --> 01:05:04.766
We both know you're
running out of clean shirts.

01:05:04.806 --> 01:05:09.237
I bet the one you're
wearing stinks pretty bad.

01:05:09.277 --> 01:05:13.856
I'm not gonna apologize because that
would mean I'm doing something wrong.

01:05:13.987 --> 01:05:15.867
And I'm not sure I am, so..

01:05:15.987 --> 01:05:18.738
I'm playing at a club tonight.

01:05:18.787 --> 01:05:22.958
A real club. Someone
important could hear my song,

01:05:23.078 --> 01:05:25.038
and next month somebody might
be singing it on the radio.

01:05:25.078 --> 01:05:27.418
- So wish me good luck.
- Good luck.

01:05:27.498 --> 01:05:31.419
Anyway, um, I'll call you
and tell you how it goes.

01:05:33.219 --> 01:05:35.008
Take care of yourself, old man.

01:05:38.469 --> 01:05:40.389
Old man.

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:44.770
All right. You should be dancing
on the floor! I wanna see your bras!

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:52.966
<i>Well, my baby and me
went out late Saturday night</i>

01:05:52.967 --> 01:05:53.967
All right.

01:05:54.071 --> 01:05:58.911
<i>I had my hair piled high and
my baby she looked so right</i>

01:05:58.991 --> 01:06:01.701
<i>Well, pick you up at 10:00
Got to have you home by 2:00</i>

01:06:01.751 --> 01:06:04.172
<i>Mama, don't know what
I catched off of you</i>

01:06:04.212 --> 01:06:08.002
<i>But that's all right, we're
looking as cool as can be</i>

01:06:08.042 --> 01:06:12.422
Is this the greatest party
we've ever been to or what, man?

01:06:15.132 --> 01:06:17.473
Lil, I can only stay two hours.

01:06:17.513 --> 01:06:20.893
- What are you talking about?
- I gotta leave early tonight, remember?

01:06:20.973 --> 01:06:22.933
- Bourbon.
- Why?

01:06:23.023 --> 01:06:24.918
Maybe you haven't noticed all the bodies

01:06:25.119 --> 01:06:26.814
you had to crawl over
to get in here tonight.

01:06:26.854 --> 01:06:27.901
- Lil, I told you,
- Four

01:06:27.902 --> 01:06:29.922
I gotta leave
by 10:30 no matter what.

01:06:29.924 --> 01:06:32.234
- Here.
- Got it. I got it.

01:06:32.284 --> 01:06:33.824
Seven.

01:06:33.904 --> 01:06:38.165
<i>That I love you, yeah</i>

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:41.045
<i>Hit me</i>

01:06:42.955 --> 01:06:46.085
- Here you go.
- What are you doing?

01:06:46.175 --> 01:06:49.136
I gotta go. It's half past.
Can you have Lou call me a cab?

01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:52.555
Listen, Jersey. You're not going anywhere.
Not tonight. This place us out of control.

01:06:52.676 --> 01:06:54.726
But, Lil, I told you. I'm
only working two hours..

01:06:54.846 --> 01:06:57.306
You wanna sing? Sing for them.

01:06:57.386 --> 01:07:00.556
These people dragged their
asses out here to see us.

01:07:00.607 --> 01:07:03.937
This is New York, and there's
a line halfway around the block.

01:07:03.977 --> 01:07:06.487
That's something, Jersey,
whether you believe it or not.

01:07:06.566 --> 01:07:08.091
<i>Last night a little dancer
came dancing to my door</i>

01:07:08.092 --> 01:07:09.617
And if I go?

01:07:09.657 --> 01:07:11.677
If you were going, you
would have left by now.

01:07:11.678 --> 01:07:13.697
<i>Last night a little angel</i>

01:07:13.738 --> 01:07:15.748
<i>And tonight</i>

01:07:15.867 --> 01:07:19.378
- Where are you?
- Lil won't let me go.

01:07:19.418 --> 01:07:23.249
Violet, just walk out. She doesn't
own you. You can still make it here.

01:07:23.338 --> 01:07:26.508
I'm sorry.

01:07:26.589 --> 01:07:29.179
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

01:07:29.259 --> 01:07:31.220
Violet.

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:37.179
- What's the story?
- She's not coming.

01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:39.770
So what am I supposed to do,
Kevin? I got a whole spot to fill.

01:07:39.849 --> 01:07:42.860
I'm sorry, Richie. I made a mistake.

01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:46.241
Whoa, this doesn't change
anything with us, Kevin.

01:07:46.361 --> 01:07:48.650
A deal's a deal. Am I right?

01:07:55.542 --> 01:07:59.792
<i>All she wants to do
is dance, dance, dance</i>

01:07:59.872 --> 01:08:03.292
<i>Wild-eyed pistol wavers
who ain't afraid to die</i>

01:08:03.343 --> 01:08:05.802
<i>And all she wants to do is</i>

01:08:05.922 --> 01:08:10.893
<i>All she wants to do is
dance and make romance</i>

01:08:11.013 --> 01:08:14.683
<i>She can't feel the heat
Comin' off the street</i>

01:08:14.763 --> 01:08:17.893
<i>She wants to party</i>

01:08:17.933 --> 01:08:20.194
<i>She wants to get down</i>

01:08:20.273 --> 01:08:22.314
<i>All she wants to do is</i>

01:08:22.354 --> 01:08:25.484
<i>All she wants to do is dance</i>

01:08:25.524 --> 01:08:27.944
<i>And make romance</i>

01:08:28.033 --> 01:08:30.453
I'm the guy! Me!

01:08:30.535 --> 01:08:33.575
<i>All she wants to do is dance</i>

01:08:35.035 --> 01:08:36.745
Zach, who said you could be up here?

01:08:41.875 --> 01:08:44.796
You're not supposed to be up here.

01:08:44.845 --> 01:08:46.805
All right. Take it easy, Zach.

01:08:46.886 --> 01:08:49.265
Zach, take it easy.

01:08:49.386 --> 01:08:54.647
<i>We barely made the airport
for the last plane out</i>

01:08:54.765 --> 01:08:56.817
- Hey, hey, knock it off!
- Kevin!

01:08:56.935 --> 01:09:00.438
Lil!

01:09:00.567 --> 01:09:02.907
Break it up!

01:09:02.948 --> 01:09:05.988
<i>- Kevin, that's enough!
- 'Cause all she wants to do is dance</i>

01:09:06.077 --> 01:09:09.698
- Help! Stop!
- Lou!

01:09:12.207 --> 01:09:16.288
- Kevin, that's enough!
Kevin, that's enough!

01:09:16.339 --> 01:09:19.048
- Get off me!
- Stop it!

01:09:19.169 --> 01:09:20.569
Kevin, Zech's a regular,
and he was just having fun.

01:09:20.569 --> 01:09:21.969
Having fun with my girlfriend!

01:09:22.090 --> 01:09:23.840
Lou, get him out of here.

01:09:23.841 --> 01:09:25.590
You're gonna chill outside,
or I'm calling the cops.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:27.849
Out of my way! Move!

01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:30.640
Let me go!

01:09:30.719 --> 01:09:34.401
- Get the hell out of here!
- Hey, everybody, free drinks on the house.

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.859
I'm paying. Get up here.

01:09:36.941 --> 01:09:40.020
Kevin, Kevin.
What is your problem?

01:09:40.201 --> 01:09:42.006
Look, I'm sorry about tonight,
but look at this.

01:09:42.006 --> 01:09:44.111
There was no
way Lil was gonna let me out.

01:09:44.161 --> 01:09:46.321
This is not about Lil. This
is about you and this place.

01:09:46.412 --> 01:09:47.682
This is my job.

01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:49.952
It's a goddamn sandbox for
you to stick your head in.

01:09:49.991 --> 01:09:52.712
- What is that supposed to mean?
- The place is a joke.

01:09:52.747 --> 01:09:54.832
All right? They don't
come to watch you sing.

01:09:54.873 --> 01:09:56.557
They come to watch
girls shaking it on a bar!

01:09:56.558 --> 01:09:57.842
And what would you have me do?

01:09:57.962 --> 01:09:58.947
Sing for quarters in the park?

01:09:58.948 --> 01:10:01.132
Well, at least you'd
be singing your own songs.

01:10:01.213 --> 01:10:03.672
I told you I can't do
that, so stop pushing!

01:10:03.803 --> 01:10:07.893
I'm just asking you to try, but I
guess that's asking a bit too much.

01:10:09.263 --> 01:10:11.273
Right. It's so easy to be you, isn't it?

01:10:11.394 --> 01:10:14.983
You have no dreams, no hopes,
no chance of getting hurt.

01:10:15.104 --> 01:10:17.314
When was the last time you
took a chance on something?

01:10:17.355 --> 01:10:21.235
- Some of us don't have that luxury.
- Why is that?

01:10:25.115 --> 01:10:29.125
Oh, right. We don't talk about
you, right? It's a big secret.

01:10:29.245 --> 01:10:32.415
Come on, Kevin. Let's play a game.

01:10:32.455 --> 01:10:34.755
I'm gonna guess why you left Australia.

01:10:34.876 --> 01:10:38.386
- Doesn't matter.
- You... were in jail.

01:10:38.506 --> 01:10:41.721
No, that's not it. You have a
wife and four kids in Sydney.

01:10:41.756 --> 01:10:44.636
Come on. Am I getting warm? Come on,
Kevin. I don't have a lot of time.

01:10:44.677 --> 01:10:46.887
Why'd you run away from home?

01:10:46.936 --> 01:10:50.857
I didn't have a home. Is
that what you wanted to hear?

01:10:50.937 --> 01:10:53.607
I don't have a family.

01:10:53.687 --> 01:10:56.488
I mean, that's the big
secret. Are you happy?

01:10:57.858 --> 01:11:00.738
Huh? Are you gonna
feel sorry for me now?

01:11:00.828 --> 01:11:04.748
You gonna hold me close while I tell you
I had to change homes every two years?

01:11:05.959 --> 01:11:08.169
I had a bad childhood. Big deal.

01:11:08.289 --> 01:11:11.088
I don't need your
sympathy, 'cause I'm here,

01:11:11.129 --> 01:11:13.169
and I'm living on my two
feet like I wanted to.

01:11:13.249 --> 01:11:15.709
That was my dream.

01:11:15.759 --> 01:11:18.879
And at least I did it with
a little bit of dignity.

01:11:20.889 --> 01:11:23.680
And I didn't. That's it?

01:11:23.761 --> 01:11:25.980
Well, just unbutton the blouse
a little and unzip the pants,

01:11:26.101 --> 01:11:28.690
show a little bit offish, I
think you can figure it out.

01:11:33.271 --> 01:11:37.742
Go on in. Your fans are waitin'
for ya to crawl on a bar.

01:11:56.463 --> 01:12:00.384
I told you not to break the rules.

01:12:00.434 --> 01:12:02.643
What are you talking about?

01:12:02.764 --> 01:12:05.513
I'm talking about you and your
boyfriend making a scene in my bar.

01:12:05.564 --> 01:12:08.434
I'm talking about a friend of
mine inside with a broken nose.

01:12:08.484 --> 01:12:12.154
The rules were simple, Jersey.
I've fired girls for a lot less.

01:12:12.274 --> 01:12:15.324
What, so I can't have a boyfriend
now? What kind of stupid shit is that?

01:12:15.445 --> 01:12:18.035
Hey! This place is my home,

01:12:18.155 --> 01:12:21.115
and I'm not willing to risk everything
I have on your personal life.

01:12:21.165 --> 01:12:23.325
It's business, plain and simple.

01:12:23.376 --> 01:12:24.326
This is not business.

01:12:24.327 --> 01:12:26.876
I worked my ass off for you, and
you're supposed to be my friend.

01:12:26.956 --> 01:12:29.521
I never said I was your friend.

01:12:29.522 --> 01:12:32.086
I'm your boss, and you knew
the rules like everybody else.

01:12:32.126 --> 01:12:36.057
Will you stop... with "the rules"?
It's a bar, for Christ's sake!

01:12:41.057 --> 01:12:43.147
Then what are you so upset about?

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:11.220
<i>Please remember</i>

01:13:18.641 --> 01:13:22.730
<i>How we laughed How we cried</i>

01:13:22.851 --> 01:13:27.231
<i>How this world was yours and mine</i>

01:13:27.311 --> 01:13:31.031
<i>And how no dream was out of reach</i>

01:13:31.112 --> 01:13:35.492
<i>I stood by you You stood by me</i>

01:13:35.571 --> 01:13:39.832
<i>We took each day and made it shine</i>

01:13:39.953 --> 01:13:43.912
<i>We wrote our names across the sky</i>

01:13:44.042 --> 01:13:48.543
<i>We ran so fast We ran so free</i>

01:13:48.593 --> 01:13:50.553
<i>And I had you</i>

01:13:50.633 --> 01:13:55.634
<i>And you had me</i>

01:13:59.764 --> 01:14:04.984
<i>Please remember</i>

01:14:10.025 --> 01:14:15.116
<i>- I'm just a love machine
- Oh, my God. Give me a bite. I'm starving.</i>

01:14:18.495 --> 01:14:22.126
- Mmm, thank you.
- How does it feel to be Mrs. Molinaro?

01:14:24.217 --> 01:14:27.377
You know, I think he was a perfect
choice for my first marriage.

01:14:29.467 --> 01:14:32.467
Hey, Gloria.

01:14:32.516 --> 01:14:36.137
Thanks for inviting me, uh..

01:14:36.188 --> 01:14:39.098
I gotta go to work. I'm
on graveyard tonight.

01:14:39.147 --> 01:14:42.398
- Thank you, Mr. Sanford.
- Yeah, well, it's not worth a hug, dear.

01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:45.318
- It's only 50 bucks.
- Aw.

01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:49.488
- Your old man's a ten, Vi.
- Eleven, some days a twelve.

01:14:51.369 --> 01:14:53.869
Well, it's a beautiful wedding.

01:14:53.949 --> 01:14:57.619
No, you can't go. I just want one picture
of you and Violet dancing together. Come on.

01:14:57.670 --> 01:15:02.340
<i>Wise men say</i>

01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:05.670
<i>- Okay. Come on. Smile.
- Only fools</i>

01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:09.341
<i>Rushin</i>

01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:13.811
<i>But I can't</i>

01:15:13.891 --> 01:15:14.106
<i>Help</i>

01:15:14.406 --> 01:15:16.521
Are you really working, or
are you leaving because of me?

01:15:16.641 --> 01:15:20.152
<i>- Falling in love
- You know I don't like to wear a tie.</i>

01:15:20.231 --> 01:15:23.982
<i>With you</i>

01:15:27.572 --> 01:15:31.572
So this is how it's gonna be? You're
not gonna return my phone calls?

01:15:31.663 --> 01:15:35.082
If you needed money, you
should have come to me.

01:15:35.203 --> 01:15:37.453
I would have found a
way to take care of you.

01:15:37.582 --> 01:15:40.293
Dad, you can't even
take care of yourself.

01:15:40.373 --> 01:15:43.753
Hey, I am doing just fine on
my own, thank you very much.

01:15:43.794 --> 01:15:46.464
Oh, really? So how come
you're not wearing any socks?

01:15:46.514 --> 01:15:50.635
<i>Falling in love with you</i>

01:15:50.936 --> 01:15:51.636
I had a minor disagreement
with a clothes dryer.

01:15:54.514 --> 01:15:57.645
<i>Like a river flows</i>

01:15:57.734 --> 01:16:00.855
<i>- Just face it, Dad. You need me.
- Surely to the sea</i>

01:16:00.904 --> 01:16:02.925
And I moved out, and
that's what bothers you.

01:16:02.926 --> 01:16:04.946
<i>Darling, so it goes</i>

01:16:05.025 --> 01:16:07.746
<i>Some things</i>

01:16:07.786 --> 01:16:09.906
<i>Are meant to be</i>

01:16:09.996 --> 01:16:12.666
What bothers me...

01:16:12.786 --> 01:16:16.296
<i>- Take my hand
- is, for the first time in my life,</i>

01:16:16.417 --> 01:16:18.666
I was ashamed of you.

01:16:18.706 --> 01:16:19.276
<i>Take my whole</i>

01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:21.277
I would have never thought that
would ever have been possible.

01:16:20.927 --> 01:16:25.772
<i>Life too</i>

01:16:25.807 --> 01:16:28.847
<i>for I can't</i>

01:16:28.967 --> 01:16:31.808
<i>help</i>

01:16:34.558 --> 01:16:36.978
Hey, it's me. Leave a
message after the beep.

01:16:37.018 --> 01:16:38.978
Violet?

01:16:39.028 --> 01:16:42.199
I've just finished work,
and in a few hours...

01:16:42.318 --> 01:16:45.239
I'm going to unload three
disgusting fish trucks.

01:16:45.319 --> 01:16:47.829
I thought maybe you'd like
to come and give me a hand.

01:16:47.949 --> 01:16:50.499
- But you're not in.
- Okay, okay, okay. I'm coming. I'm coming.

01:16:50.619 --> 01:16:54.630
Or you're not picking
up, so I'll call back...

01:16:54.750 --> 01:16:59.920
because I'm hoping one
day you... will wanna talk.

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:02.970
Kevin? Hello?

01:17:17.111 --> 01:17:21.362
Kevin? Hello? It's me.

01:17:21.402 --> 01:17:25.072
- I'm here.
- Is this Violet Sanford?

01:17:25.112 --> 01:17:28.493
I'm calling from
Riverview Medical Center.

01:17:28.533 --> 01:17:33.123
We have a patient here by the name of
William James Sanford. Is that your father?

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:41.964
Violet Sanford?

01:17:42.014 --> 01:17:45.684
Your dad's in recovery right now.

01:17:45.805 --> 01:17:48.355
The car struck him on his right side
when he was walking to the booth.

01:17:48.475 --> 01:17:52.025
His right leg is broken, and there was some
arterial damage we had to go in and repair.

01:17:52.145 --> 01:17:54.645
But other than that, it's just
a lot of bumps and bruises.

01:17:54.695 --> 01:17:56.905
I'd say he's a pretty lucky guy.

01:17:58.156 --> 01:18:00.405
Violet?

01:18:00.486 --> 01:18:04.116
I told you, don't come down
here. It's your wedding night.

01:18:04.206 --> 01:18:09.837
Oh, are you kidding? Danny's been
in my family for five minutes.

01:18:09.876 --> 01:18:13.046
You've been in my family my whole life.

01:18:44.290 --> 01:18:48.170
Mmm, I'm sorry.

01:18:51.041 --> 01:18:55.261
I love you... so much.

01:18:58.301 --> 01:19:00.891
I never did thank you for the dance.

01:19:03.101 --> 01:19:05.062
That's okay.

01:19:05.181 --> 01:19:07.102
That's all right.

01:19:32.794 --> 01:19:35.884
My tapes.

01:19:45.065 --> 01:19:49.605
Come on. Just call him. Just
pick up the phone and call him.

01:19:55.696 --> 01:19:58.696
Don't call him.

01:20:01.367 --> 01:20:04.076
Told you. This place is a palace.

01:20:04.207 --> 01:20:06.877
It's pretty late. Are you
sure you wanna do this now?

01:20:06.957 --> 01:20:10.628
Well, here's my door. No
turning back now. Come on in.

01:20:12.008 --> 01:20:15.097
Oh, you're so right.
This place is a palace.

01:20:15.218 --> 01:20:20.178
- Would I lie to you? - This
is a great idea. I'm so glad-

01:20:21.388 --> 01:20:24.058
Nice strong pulse.

01:20:24.099 --> 01:20:27.269
Don't look at me like
that. I'm a sick man.

01:20:27.398 --> 01:20:29.779
You can eat whatever you want
now, but when we go back home,

01:20:29.899 --> 01:20:32.319
it's egg whites and Lean Cuisines.

01:20:32.399 --> 01:20:35.739
- I'll see you later, Bill.
- Wait a minute.

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:39.290
What do you mean, "until we go home"?

01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:43.540
I'm moving back.

01:20:44.670 --> 01:20:48.880
I couldn't do it. I
couldn't sing my songs.

01:20:48.961 --> 01:20:52.931
I was afraid.

01:20:55.341 --> 01:20:58.011
Do you know why Mommy quit?

01:20:59.772 --> 01:21:02.852
Yeah, she told me..
'cause she couldn't do it.

01:21:02.942 --> 01:21:06.112
No, that's not it.

01:21:07.312 --> 01:21:11.113
She wasn't afraid, Vi.

01:21:11.153 --> 01:21:15.573
Your mother on stage
- Oh, she was amazing.

01:21:16.823 --> 01:21:18.744
Then why did she quit?

01:21:20.044 --> 01:21:21.954
Because of me.

01:21:23.624 --> 01:21:27.794
Right after you were born,
she told me she wanted to quit,

01:21:27.844 --> 01:21:31.304
and I let her.

01:21:33.804 --> 01:21:38.265
See, I knew how good she
was, but I never told her.

01:21:40.516 --> 01:21:43.936
I loved her...

01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:46.315
more than anything.

01:21:46.356 --> 01:21:49.696
And I just went on and pretended
that there was no other choice.

01:21:51.906 --> 01:21:54.707
- Dad, it's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

01:21:54.827 --> 01:21:58.577
I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.
You're not goin' back to work for Pete.

01:21:58.627 --> 01:22:03.127
I don't care what it takes. I don't
care how many bars you have to stand on.

01:22:03.208 --> 01:22:06.297
You are not comin' home. I'm not
letting you back in the house.

01:22:07.378 --> 01:22:09.598
Forget it.

01:22:19.229 --> 01:22:20.559
Are you wearing cologne?

01:22:22.729 --> 01:22:26.650
Oh, well, it's just
a... splash of Old Spice.

01:22:27.909 --> 01:22:29.870
Where did you get Old Spice?

01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:34.200
That nice redheaded nurse
gave it to me as a gift.

01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:36.500
Then she asked me out for coffee.

01:22:36.621 --> 01:22:38.750
I'm scared.

01:22:38.831 --> 01:22:40.750
Are you gonna go on a date?

01:22:40.841 --> 01:22:42.750
God, a date.

01:22:44.262 --> 01:22:46.171
I better buy a pair of socks.

01:22:58.773 --> 01:23:02.313
Okay. Come on in here. Watch out for the
- Okay. Okay.

01:23:09.414 --> 01:23:14.164
<i>Try to resist Try to hide from my kiss</i>

01:23:16.704 --> 01:23:18.664
<i>Can't fight the moonlight</i>

01:23:26.555 --> 01:23:29.435
<i>You can't fight the moonlight</i>

01:23:31.345 --> 01:23:33.766
<i>You'll surrender your heart</i>

01:23:33.805 --> 01:23:37.646
<i>but you know But you know that you</i>

01:23:43.486 --> 01:23:47.117
Okay if I eat here at the bar?

01:23:47.197 --> 01:23:51.117
Do you have a reservation?

01:23:51.167 --> 01:23:55.587
It's under, um, "cast-iron
heartless bitch. "

01:23:55.668 --> 01:23:58.508
Could it be under
"stubborn and pigheaded"?

01:23:58.627 --> 01:24:02.128
Yes. That's the one.

01:24:02.258 --> 01:24:04.638
I'll have a double water
on the rocks, please.

01:24:06.758 --> 01:24:09.638
- How'd you find me?
- Cammie.

01:24:09.679 --> 01:24:13.349
She told me about your pop.
I'm sorry to hear about that.

01:24:13.399 --> 01:24:15.310
He's okay.

01:24:15.439 --> 01:24:17.320
Good.

01:24:18.439 --> 01:24:21.650
- So am I.
- Yeah. Yeah, I can see that.

01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:25.821
What's good to eat here?

01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:29.410
Lil, you didn't come here
to eat. What do you want?

01:24:33.171 --> 01:24:35.132
'Kay.

01:24:37.841 --> 01:24:41.842
I just wanted to let you know you can
come back to the bar whenever you want.

01:24:43.882 --> 01:24:49.012
- I appreciate the offer, but I'm okay here.
- I figured that.

01:24:49.047 --> 01:24:51.683
You were never a lifer.

01:24:51.773 --> 01:24:54.853
I'm married to that bar. Hell, I'd, uh..

01:24:54.902 --> 01:24:59.193
I'd sleep there if I had the
guts to walk around barefoot.

01:24:59.233 --> 01:25:01.743
But that's me, you know?

01:25:01.863 --> 01:25:04.863
I'm the original Coyote..

01:25:04.954 --> 01:25:08.454
just a small town gal trying
to make it in the big bad city.

01:25:09.745 --> 01:25:12.004
"Small town gal"?

01:25:14.425 --> 01:25:16.335
Piedmont, North Dakota.

01:25:18.965 --> 01:25:21.965
You ever tell anyone that, I'll kill ya.

01:25:23.426 --> 01:25:26.436
Take care, Jersey.

01:25:28.056 --> 01:25:31.776
You have one new message.

01:25:33.897 --> 01:25:35.907
I have one message in eight
hours. How pathetic am I?

01:25:35.947 --> 01:25:38.947
Violet, this is Lyndsey Morgan
from the Bowery Ballroom.

01:25:39.026 --> 01:25:41.237
Listen, we loved your CD,

01:25:41.287 --> 01:25:45.157
and we want you to play in our
songwriter's showcase next Sunday night.

01:25:45.208 --> 01:25:49.078
You're on at 10:00sharp. So
drop your music by the club,

01:25:49.128 --> 01:25:51.088
and the house band can learn your song.

01:25:51.167 --> 01:25:55.168
Now if you have any questions, don't be
afraid to give me a shout. See ya Sunday.

01:25:55.219 --> 01:25:56.654
Here are the keys to the apartment.

01:25:56.655 --> 01:25:58.089
It's all yours.
Thank you.

01:25:58.178 --> 01:26:00.688
I can't thank you enough
for subleasing me this place.

01:26:00.689 --> 01:26:01.599
You don't know how long I looked.

01:26:01.719 --> 01:26:03.639
And when is your boyfriend moving in?

01:26:03.719 --> 01:26:07.099
He's actually coming
in tomorrow from Boston.

01:26:07.139 --> 01:26:11.479
It's historic, guys. This is the first
night I've closed early in three years.

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:14.240
Ta-da. Will you hang
that outside for me?

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:16.240
Hey, Lou, you got that
number I asked you about?

01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:18.780
So why are you moving to Chicago?

01:26:18.861 --> 01:26:21.780
I'll figure that out when I get there.

01:26:25.831 --> 01:26:26.916
Hello.

01:26:26.917 --> 01:26:30.002
Hey, do yourself a favor and
look at page 137 of The Voice.

01:26:30.081 --> 01:26:34.131
I can't believe your name is in
the paper. I'm gettin' this framed.

01:26:34.212 --> 01:26:37.592
Dad, if you're not ready in five
minutes, I'm gonna leave without you.

01:26:37.682 --> 01:26:40.473
Keep your pants on, will ya?
I'm physically challenged.

01:26:43.643 --> 01:26:45.932
I only got three rolls of
film. I hope that's enough.

01:26:45.983 --> 01:26:48.313
Dad, I'm only singing one song.

01:26:48.353 --> 01:26:50.353
Right. Better go get another one.

01:26:52.314 --> 01:26:54.284
Hey, Bill.

01:26:54.324 --> 01:26:56.784
My kid's singing tonight
at some club in the city.

01:26:56.903 --> 01:27:00.534
She's a little nervous. Hey, maybe you
can give us a one, two, three for luck.

01:27:00.615 --> 01:27:03.995
You got it. All right, let's give
it up for Bill Sanford's daughter.

01:27:04.034 --> 01:27:08.005
Light 'em up. One, two, three.

01:27:11.005 --> 01:27:14.555
Oh, look, Vi.

01:27:14.596 --> 01:27:17.136
I can't do this.

01:27:17.215 --> 01:27:20.096
Jesus!

01:27:20.136 --> 01:27:23.806
Did I mention to you that I was
recently in a horrific car accident?

01:27:23.937 --> 01:27:26.477
I can't do this. I gotta go back.

01:27:26.526 --> 01:27:28.736
Violet, listen to me. Are you listening?

01:27:28.856 --> 01:27:31.817
You have nothing to be afraid
of. You're already a star.

01:27:31.857 --> 01:27:33.847
Dad, what are you talking about?
I'm a nobody.

01:27:33.848 --> 01:27:35.238
If you're such anybody,

01:27:35.277 --> 01:27:38.197
Then why did I buy this
off Pete for 20 bucks?

01:27:40.408 --> 01:27:42.208
Why do you have that?

01:27:42.209 --> 01:27:45.208
I saw it on the wall, decided
I wanted the first autograph.

01:27:45.288 --> 01:27:48.173
I figured it'd be a
damn good investment.

01:27:48.208 --> 01:27:48.803
Now what are you waiting for?

01:27:48.804 --> 01:27:50.799
I didn't spend three months
in physical therapy...

01:27:50.879 --> 01:27:53.589
Just to take a ride to
the state line, you got me?

01:27:53.639 --> 01:27:55.229
Yeah, I got ya.

01:27:55.230 --> 01:27:58.019
- So what do you say, Vi?
- How about another U-ey?

01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:05.810
You guys call in a one, two,
three! Now, let's do it again.

01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:07.980
This time I wanna feel chills!

01:28:08.031 --> 01:28:10.090
There goes Bill again.
He's back for seconds.

01:28:10.091 --> 01:28:12.150
Come on now! Let's give him all we got!

01:28:12.201 --> 01:28:15.571
Let's go!

01:28:15.621 --> 01:28:18.541
The only reason why I came down here
tonight is to see her fall on her face.

01:28:18.661 --> 01:28:21.212
Oh, take it easy, Rachel. It's
supposed to be a nice night out.

01:28:21.251 --> 01:28:23.372
- Excuse me.
- I'm cool. Don't worry about me.

01:28:23.422 --> 01:28:26.752
- Hi. Good evening, ladies. Can I help you?
- No.

01:28:26.792 --> 01:28:29.382
It's packed, Lyndsey. The house
band has been on for 15 minutes.

01:28:29.462 --> 01:28:31.382
If she's not here in five, she's bumped.

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:34.642
Jesus!

01:28:34.762 --> 01:28:37.603
Uh, now that we're here,
I'm feeling a little nervous.

01:28:37.683 --> 01:28:40.143
Thank you, Mr. Sanford.

01:28:40.223 --> 01:28:43.393
Oh, oh, probably just carsick.

01:28:43.443 --> 01:28:46.364
Forget I mentioned it. I'm
fine. Have a great show.

01:28:48.524 --> 01:28:51.194
Vi.

01:28:51.244 --> 01:28:54.454
Get your butt in there. Come
on. We're right behind you.

01:28:54.574 --> 01:28:56.784
Break a leg, sweetie.

01:28:58.744 --> 01:29:00.665
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:29:00.745 --> 01:29:06.136
making her Bowery Ballroom
debut, Miss Violet Sanford!

01:29:30.278 --> 01:29:32.868
I'm sorry.

01:29:48.339 --> 01:29:50.760
<i>Under a lovers' sky</i>

01:29:50.799 --> 01:29:53.430
<i>Gonna be with you</i>

01:29:53.470 --> 01:29:57.940
<i>And no one's gonna be around</i>

01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:01.020
<i>If you think that you won't fall</i>

01:30:01.071 --> 01:30:03.320
<i>We'll just wait until</i>

01:30:03.401 --> 01:30:06.700
<i>Till the sun goes down</i>

01:30:06.821 --> 01:30:11.451
<i>Underneath the starlight, starlight</i>

01:30:11.531 --> 01:30:16.412
<i>There's a magical feelin' so right</i>

01:30:16.462 --> 01:30:20.382
<i>It will take you in tonight</i>

01:30:20.502 --> 01:30:24.632
<i>- You can try to resist
- Whoa! Violet!</i>

01:30:24.713 --> 01:30:26.723
<i>Try to hide from my kiss but you know</i>

01:30:26.842 --> 01:30:30.893
<i>But you know that you
can't fight the moonlight</i>

01:30:31.014 --> 01:30:34.973
<i>Deep in the dark you'll
surrender your heart</i>

01:30:35.024 --> 01:30:37.394
<i>But you know, but you know</i>

01:30:37.433 --> 01:30:42.314
<i>That you can't fight the moonlight, no</i>

01:30:42.364 --> 01:30:44.984
<i>You can't fight it</i>

01:30:45.035 --> 01:30:48.825
<i>It's gonna get to your heart</i>

01:30:48.905 --> 01:30:52.285
<i>There's no escape from love</i>

01:30:52.325 --> 01:30:55.496
<i>Once the gentle breeze</i>

01:30:55.545 --> 01:30:58.415
<i>Weaves its spell upon your heart</i>

01:30:59.546 --> 01:31:02.596
<i>No matter what you think</i>

01:31:02.716 --> 01:31:07.216
<i>It won't be too long
till you're in my arms</i>

01:31:07.347 --> 01:31:09.936
<i>- Come on, baby. Shake it!
- Underneath - Hey, pinhead.</i>

01:31:10.056 --> 01:31:11.016
<i>The starlight, starlight</i>

01:31:11.017 --> 01:31:11.977
That's not long enough, baby!
Now shake it!

01:31:12.057 --> 01:31:15.477
Come on. Don't do it, Rach. He's a
big guy, and you're still on probation.

01:31:15.517 --> 01:31:18.437
Don't worry. Those classes
are really paying off.

01:31:18.527 --> 01:31:21.858
<i>It'll steal your heart tonight</i>

01:31:21.907 --> 01:31:24.198
<i>You can try to resist</i>

01:31:24.277 --> 01:31:26.658
<i>Try to hide from my kiss</i>

01:31:26.738 --> 01:31:28.914
<i>But you know, but you know</i>

01:31:28.949 --> 01:31:32.329
<i>That you can't fight the moonlight</i>

01:31:32.368 --> 01:31:36.669
<i>Deep in the dark you'll
surrender your heart</i>

01:31:36.748 --> 01:31:38.509
<i>But you know, but you know</i>

01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:41.879
<i>That you can't fight the moonlight</i>

01:31:55.730 --> 01:32:00.491
Okay. Let's give a big
Coyote welcome to LeAnn Rimes.

01:32:00.611 --> 01:32:03.161
<i>You can try to resist</i>

01:32:03.281 --> 01:32:05.991
<i>Try to hide from my kiss</i>

01:32:06.031 --> 01:32:09.792
<i>But you know, but you know</i>

01:32:09.871 --> 01:32:13.753
So tell me, what do you do when you
realize that all your dreams have come true?

01:32:13.832 --> 01:32:16.632
You pay off old debts.

01:32:16.712 --> 01:32:19.002
<i>But you know, but you
know that you can't</i>

01:32:19.053 --> 01:32:21.383
<i>- Can't fight the moonlight
- Volume 129.</i>

01:32:21.423 --> 01:32:26.473
The original appearance of the
Punisher the one I cost you.

01:32:26.554 --> 01:32:30.353
<i>- Thank you.
- It will fill your heart tonight</i>

01:32:30.394 --> 01:32:32.564
<i>- You can try

<i>But you know, but you know</i>

01:32:37.774 --> 01:32:41.994
Lil, don't think your
new girl's gonna hack it.
