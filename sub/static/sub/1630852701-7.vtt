00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:31.000 --> 00:35.208
Here, where neither the sun
nor the moon shines.

00:36.375 --> 00:39.125
Here, in our home, Sofía.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.875
Follow me to the kingdom, honey.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.875
Tell me what to do, Mom.

00:52.833 --> 00:54.291
Open the final veil.

00:56.458 --> 00:58.083
Bring me a blood soul.

01:08.958 --> 01:10.041
Did I hurt you?

01:10.541 --> 01:12.250
Don't worry. Almost done.

01:33.333 --> 01:35.875
<i>You're not real.</i>

01:35.958 --> 01:39.291
You aren't real!

01:39.375 --> 01:40.708
No!

01:40.791 --> 01:42.250
-You're fake!
-Lieutenant.

01:42.833 --> 01:43.916
Let me go!

01:44.000 --> 01:45.541
This isn't happening!

01:46.041 --> 01:47.625
None of you are real!

01:47.708 --> 01:50.583
No! This isn't real!

01:50.666 --> 01:52.583
Let me go! No!

02:14.166 --> 02:15.291
Civil Guard.

02:16.291 --> 02:18.500
We're getting you out of here.
What's your name?

02:20.041 --> 02:21.333
They call me Blanca.

02:22.583 --> 02:24.000
But I am nothing.

02:25.333 --> 02:27.541
I am but the vessel of the light.

02:58.291 --> 02:59.625
You went into the mine,

03:00.208 --> 03:02.291
and yet you're the only one
who came out alive.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.250
How do you explain that?

03:08.250 --> 03:10.791
I am the one who died.

03:13.458 --> 03:15.291
What happened down there?

03:15.958 --> 03:19.583
Knowledge is reserved
only for one in a thousand men.

03:21.416 --> 03:24.333
Two in two thousand.

03:25.416 --> 03:26.833
Are you among them?

03:27.791 --> 03:28.750
Try me.

03:35.166 --> 03:37.875
Those who live in oblivion
will disappear along with it.

03:39.375 --> 03:42.541
But those who have found knowledge
will be eternal.

03:45.541 --> 03:46.708
Which kind are you?

04:16.250 --> 04:18.041
You're death! Don't touch me again!

04:18.125 --> 04:20.250
This is bullshit.

04:20.333 --> 04:22.583
-All of you are a freak show!
-Stay away from me.

04:22.666 --> 04:24.583
-How long have you been with the cult?
-Stay away!

04:24.666 --> 04:26.833
-Were you behind the ritual in the mine?
-Stay away!

04:27.416 --> 04:28.583
Answer me!

04:36.041 --> 04:38.708
<i>So, they made her believe</i>
<i>she was some sort of chosen one?</i>

04:40.416 --> 04:41.666
That woman…

04:43.291 --> 04:47.666
If I told you that I bought into
her mystical spiel, if only for a second,

04:47.750 --> 04:49.625
you'd think I was an idiot, right?

04:53.541 --> 04:56.125
The bags under your eyes
aren't doing you any favors.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.125
You need some sleep.

05:00.750 --> 05:02.875
Let someone else finish the paperwork.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.875
-What happens now is up to the judges.
-No.

05:05.958 --> 05:07.708
Blanca is the key to all this.

05:08.458 --> 05:11.708
Maybe Pablo and Elena didn't incite it.

05:12.583 --> 05:13.750
What are you looking for?

05:16.250 --> 05:21.875
One of those nutcases can brainwash people

05:22.875 --> 05:24.083
into killing themselves

05:25.333 --> 05:26.333
or others.

05:29.250 --> 05:30.666
I never saw that woman.

05:31.541 --> 05:32.541
Are you sure?

05:33.208 --> 05:35.291
Maybe she was
in the mine the day you went in.

05:35.375 --> 05:37.791
And what did she do? Put a hex on me?

05:38.541 --> 05:41.125
Then she turned into a rat
and left without anyone seeing?

05:44.375 --> 05:47.333
It didn't sound
nearly as ridiculous in my head.

05:50.625 --> 05:51.916
You want to help me?

05:55.833 --> 05:57.041
Then be my friend.

06:00.666 --> 06:02.291
Come by every once in a while.

06:16.166 --> 06:17.458
Sofía.

06:20.666 --> 06:21.916
Want me to give it to you?

06:23.583 --> 06:24.583
Sofía.

06:25.291 --> 06:26.458
Sofía, please.

06:28.500 --> 06:29.958
You're taking those pills!

06:30.041 --> 06:32.250
It's fine. We'll have them
give her an injection.

06:32.750 --> 06:36.041
You're not fooling me with your act.
You think this is one big joke.

06:36.125 --> 06:37.833
-Eva.
-So open your mouth.

06:37.916 --> 06:39.583
-Open it.
-You're going to hurt her!

06:39.666 --> 06:42.875
-Open your mouth, dammit!
-Eva! Let her go!

06:42.958 --> 06:43.958
Open your mouth!

06:44.041 --> 06:45.875
-Open up!
-Eva, please! Stop!

06:45.958 --> 06:47.750
You're gonna hurt her! Enough!

06:47.833 --> 06:48.708
Eva!

06:55.041 --> 06:56.625
Are you okay? Let me see.

07:11.791 --> 07:12.916
She's asleep.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.500
-Eva--
-I know. Save it.

07:24.750 --> 07:27.708
I know I was out of control.
It won't happen again.

07:32.041 --> 07:33.708
I hate seeing her like that.

07:35.083 --> 07:37.041
She doesn't care
whether she lives or dies.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.666
The way she sees it,
right now we're the bad ones,

07:43.125 --> 07:44.916
keeping her from the kingdom.

07:45.750 --> 07:47.583
What's so great about it anyway?

07:48.875 --> 07:51.875
The way Ezcaray described it,
there's nothing there.

07:52.625 --> 07:55.875
No pain, no passion.
Nothing. It's like being in a coma.

07:56.583 --> 07:59.041
I think you're trying to do too much.

08:00.291 --> 08:01.708
Don't forget I'm here for you…

08:02.833 --> 08:03.666
Guillén too.

08:10.666 --> 08:12.166
I just miss her is all.

08:17.375 --> 08:20.750
I miss the fights we used to have
over how bad her chameleon smells.

08:21.291 --> 08:24.416
Or over how she insists on
buying white chocolate.

08:25.875 --> 08:27.666
Who even likes white chocolate?

08:31.166 --> 08:32.166
Know what?

08:34.375 --> 08:36.750
You'll be fighting over
it again in no time.

08:37.375 --> 08:38.416
You'll see.

08:40.291 --> 08:41.291
I'm scared.

08:43.041 --> 08:44.791
I don't want her to end up like Candela.

08:56.166 --> 08:57.208
<i>She isn't speaking.</i>

08:57.875 --> 08:59.375
<i>This isn't the first time.</i>

08:59.875 --> 09:01.041
<i>I checked her file.</i>

09:01.541 --> 09:05.291
<i>Six years ago, Candela spent</i>
<i>three months in a hospital in Córdoba.</i>

09:05.791 --> 09:09.458
You told everyone she had pneumonia.

09:10.166 --> 09:13.541
What business is it of anyone's
why my wife was admitted?

09:16.458 --> 09:17.458
Right.

09:18.333 --> 09:19.833
Perhaps you're aware

09:19.916 --> 09:23.083
Father Ezcaray kept some notebooks,
recording bits here and there.

09:23.166 --> 09:24.750
Sometimes it was personal.

09:25.375 --> 09:27.500
Other times he wrote about the cult.

09:30.125 --> 09:33.708
For the past 15 years,
someone in this town had been visiting him

09:33.791 --> 09:35.916
to give him
information about this religion.

09:36.916 --> 09:38.875
Ezcaray never said who it was.

09:39.375 --> 09:42.083
But he did write about

09:42.166 --> 09:45.208
how they'd been hospitalized
with pneumonia six years ago.

09:45.291 --> 09:49.166
I'd never have made
the connection to Candela.

09:49.708 --> 09:52.791
But I gave the notebooks
to Estrella, the psychologist.

09:53.625 --> 09:55.250
She remembered Candela's pneumonia.

09:55.333 --> 09:57.833
That doesn't make any sense.

09:58.583 --> 09:59.750
Candela…

10:01.541 --> 10:03.500
What would she know about those lunatics?

10:04.625 --> 10:07.250
My mother never mentioned
anything about the cult.

10:07.833 --> 10:08.708
She was religious.

10:08.791 --> 10:09.625
Mar.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.458
She was part of it.

10:12.250 --> 10:15.625
During the exam, the doctor found
a scar shaped like their symbol.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.958
That was from an accident years ago.

10:19.625 --> 10:22.041
Candela… has anxiety problems.

10:22.541 --> 10:24.125
She trusted Father Ezcaray.

10:24.208 --> 10:27.916
That's always been her problem.
She puts too much trust in people.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.958
The priest, her neighbors.

10:30.041 --> 10:30.916
Everyone.

10:31.416 --> 10:32.500
Look, Lozano.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.333
I'm trying to help, okay?

10:36.833 --> 10:39.875
There's a good chance
someone drove Candela to this state.

10:39.958 --> 10:41.291
My wife is sick.

10:41.791 --> 10:44.250
All I care about is that she gets better.

11:17.041 --> 11:18.958
Not now, Lieutenant.

11:20.500 --> 11:23.500
Snowflake knows not to disturb her.

11:36.083 --> 11:38.375
We're going to search
the house in the woods.

11:38.458 --> 11:39.833
You're coming with me.

11:42.416 --> 11:43.583
Everyone except her.

12:32.333 --> 12:33.416
Sofía?

12:35.125 --> 12:37.125
The final veil is the kingdom.

12:38.250 --> 12:39.333
Sofía.

12:41.708 --> 12:44.375
The gate will open with a blood soul.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.583
What are you doing here?

12:49.208 --> 12:50.791
How did you find this place?

12:51.791 --> 12:53.458
Dekta and I are connected.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.000
Soon the pain will cease.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.333
Soon we will be one.

13:09.750 --> 13:13.208
What's the path to the kingdom like?
Can you see it?

13:13.291 --> 13:14.666
Is my brother there?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.083
I'm sorry.

13:53.541 --> 13:54.541
<i>"Bježi."</i>

13:59.750 --> 14:00.750
"Run."

14:03.333 --> 14:05.791
No. Why would Goran write "run"?

14:07.500 --> 14:08.375
Sofía?

14:10.708 --> 14:12.000
Sofía?

14:12.083 --> 14:13.041
Sofía!

14:14.583 --> 14:15.583
Sofía!

14:38.291 --> 14:39.666
<i>What'd you do down there?</i>

14:41.125 --> 14:43.083
Did you ever take Sofía there?

14:44.750 --> 14:47.375
Look, we collected
samples and fingerprints.

14:47.458 --> 14:49.916
Either you tell me, or the lab will.

14:53.375 --> 14:54.958
You'll find blood.

14:56.708 --> 14:57.958
Our fingerprints.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.416
Sofía's too.

15:03.666 --> 15:06.000
Traces of hallucinogens and semen.

15:06.083 --> 15:07.208
Not that it matters.

15:08.250 --> 15:10.708
They're pieces of a puzzle
you'll never solve.

15:13.375 --> 15:14.791
Did you rape Sofía?

15:17.916 --> 15:19.833
What makes you think I could?

15:20.333 --> 15:21.958
Who molested her, then?

15:22.666 --> 15:24.625
Was it the kid, Halid?

15:24.708 --> 15:25.791
Where's he hiding?

15:32.333 --> 15:34.833
I can make prison hell for you.

15:34.916 --> 15:37.333
Half my body is already dead.

15:37.416 --> 15:39.541
Prison doesn't scare me.

15:44.416 --> 15:46.583
Does my faith bother you that much?

16:01.791 --> 16:03.875
Hitting me won't change anything.

16:04.541 --> 16:06.625
But you have no idea how good it feels.

16:07.458 --> 16:09.208
Who arranged the mine ritual?

16:09.291 --> 16:10.291
Was it Elena?

16:10.375 --> 16:11.708
You tell me.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.458
Was it Blanca?

16:20.500 --> 16:22.916
Lieutenant, no.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.916
Are you afraid?

16:27.291 --> 16:28.708
You were with Blanca.

16:30.541 --> 16:34.750
Are you scared because you know
you're dying just like me?

16:36.166 --> 16:39.291
Really, you piece of shit?
And here I thought I was immortal.

16:41.541 --> 16:43.875
Let the kingdom come. Let him judge you.

16:44.375 --> 16:46.000
There's no stopping it now.

16:46.708 --> 16:48.125
No!

19:01.916 --> 19:04.291
Sofía and Dekta are connected.

19:04.833 --> 19:08.291
That explains why you saw her
in the temple when she wasn't there.

19:08.375 --> 19:09.833
They are one now.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.458
I'm not sure what I saw.

19:11.541 --> 19:12.708
She took me by the hand.

19:12.791 --> 19:16.333
Then I saw <i>"bježi"</i>
was written on the ground.

19:16.416 --> 19:17.333
"Run."

19:18.000 --> 19:19.958
Why would he write that?

19:20.833 --> 19:23.416
If Elena performed the ritual,
Goran should've been happy.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.125
He was about to enter the gate.

19:25.208 --> 19:27.541
Instead, he wrote "run."
I know he did it for me.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.458
Stop measuring that world
with words from this one.

19:31.291 --> 19:33.500
Happiness, pain…

19:34.000 --> 19:35.833
What does that mean there?

19:35.916 --> 19:36.750
Nothing.

19:36.833 --> 19:39.083
In the kingdom, we all shall be one.

19:40.666 --> 19:41.833
He was afraid.

19:42.875 --> 19:45.250
Isn't a baby afraid
when it's about to be born?

19:47.333 --> 19:51.708
Sofía will go to the temple
and sacrifice herself at the altar.

19:52.208 --> 19:57.125
Once the fifth veil is open,
the Solitary King will come, Halid.

19:58.083 --> 19:59.583
There will be no more pain.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.958
And you and Goran can be together.

20:11.333 --> 20:12.500
Estrella.

20:13.708 --> 20:15.833
I'll have the test results tomorrow,

20:15.916 --> 20:17.125
but it's likely…

20:18.000 --> 20:19.875
that Sofía had sexual relations.

20:19.958 --> 20:21.958
And I don't know if it was consensual.

20:24.250 --> 20:25.750
Those bastards.

20:27.666 --> 20:29.375
The ones you arrested told you that?

20:29.458 --> 20:33.875
No, they're too busy spouting crap
about truth and the kingdom,

20:33.958 --> 20:36.791
saying how Blanca is the carrier
of the light or something.

20:38.666 --> 20:39.666
The vessel.

20:40.250 --> 20:41.250
What?

20:41.750 --> 20:42.875
In his notebooks,

20:43.375 --> 20:47.875
Ezcaray wrote about lesser gods,
archons, that can cross the threshold.

20:47.958 --> 20:51.833
Supposedly, when they enter our world,
they have to inhabit a human body.

20:51.916 --> 20:52.833
A vessel.

20:53.333 --> 20:54.750
They can't live outside of one.

20:55.250 --> 20:56.208
Not for very long.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.500
I wanted to see the painting again

21:00.000 --> 21:03.250
just in case it could help us
understand this a little better.

21:10.541 --> 21:13.708
What they did to Sofía…

21:15.916 --> 21:17.708
was it part of a ritual?

21:19.541 --> 21:21.750
I read that Gnostic sects

21:22.250 --> 21:25.791
would offer their bodies as a sign of
freeing oneself from the physical world.

21:27.583 --> 21:28.583
I don't know.

21:29.291 --> 21:30.291
It's possible.

21:31.416 --> 21:32.916
I've been asking Blanca,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.541
but the second she starts going on
about perfect ones,

21:35.625 --> 21:37.291
I just want to punch her.

21:41.875 --> 21:43.291
Want me to give it a shot?

21:44.958 --> 21:47.375
<i>Maybe I can understand her.</i>

22:09.750 --> 22:12.208
He was going to suffocate.
Why'd you put him in there?

22:14.666 --> 22:15.541
Move.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.791
-None of you understand.
-Understand what?

22:18.791 --> 22:20.250
Can't you see I'm trying to help?

22:22.541 --> 22:23.625
I saw Mom.

22:25.416 --> 22:27.041
I saw the light of the kingdom.

22:29.166 --> 22:32.125
You won't stop me
from opening the gate to be with her.

22:33.541 --> 22:35.125
Nobody can stop it now.

22:38.375 --> 22:40.125
Sofía, are you listening to yourself?

22:42.416 --> 22:43.708
The kingdom will come.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.583
When it does,
maybe you won't be among the chosen.

22:49.500 --> 22:50.791
But I will.

22:51.666 --> 22:53.500
Because I'm a perfect one,

22:54.250 --> 22:55.291
just like Mom.

23:02.291 --> 23:05.458
I thought it was a crappy idea
to let you see your kids,

23:05.541 --> 23:07.666
but now all I have left are crappy ideas.

23:17.166 --> 23:18.083
Dad.

23:18.583 --> 23:19.583
Eva.

23:25.125 --> 23:29.166
Please tell me you're not involved
with that fucking cult.

23:29.666 --> 23:31.583
Of course I'm not, honey.

23:33.166 --> 23:35.041
Why didn't Sofía come?

23:40.666 --> 23:41.583
Go on, Eva.

23:42.333 --> 23:43.833
Isn't this what you wanted?

23:48.416 --> 23:49.625
Dad, Sofía…

23:50.625 --> 23:52.125
I don't know how it happened because…

23:52.208 --> 23:54.250
I swear I was watching her, but…

23:55.458 --> 23:57.875
somehow the people
from the cult got to her.

23:58.791 --> 24:00.916
They brainwashed her.

24:03.541 --> 24:04.791
What do you mean?

24:05.291 --> 24:09.333
She's convinced
that life is some sort of dream

24:10.083 --> 24:12.916
and that the only thing that's real
is the crazy stuff about the kingdom.

24:17.625 --> 24:19.125
You must be happy, Pablo.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.833
Your daughter joined your side.

24:26.916 --> 24:30.750
…not willing for any to perish,
but for all to come to repentance.

24:30.833 --> 24:34.500
Grant my sick wife
the virtue of repentance.

24:34.583 --> 24:36.791
-Grant my wife…
-Don't you get tired of it?

24:37.458 --> 24:39.750
You parade God around,
as if it were the answer.

24:40.375 --> 24:42.250
It isn't the answer to shit.

24:42.750 --> 24:44.041
Know what I'm tired of?

24:45.291 --> 24:46.958
Your lack of respect.

24:49.541 --> 24:50.541
Tough luck.

24:51.166 --> 24:54.166
The saint has
a mouthy lesbian for a daughter.

24:55.208 --> 24:56.750
What's the Bible say about that?

24:57.833 --> 25:00.708
Because you clearly can't say a word.

25:09.583 --> 25:12.916
This family is a shit show,
and lighting candles won't fix anything.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.250
What do you want me to do?

25:16.041 --> 25:17.875
Why don't you try telling the truth?

25:18.458 --> 25:22.916
Mom was never okay,
and you never helped her get better.

25:23.541 --> 25:26.458
-How do you think this all started?
-I don't know.

25:26.541 --> 25:27.541
You tell me.

25:28.750 --> 25:31.583
Maybe it started
when she found out she couldn't have kids.

25:36.958 --> 25:37.958
So it is true.

25:40.833 --> 25:43.958
<i>…up to 24 liters per square meter</i>
<i>of rainfall in Vigo.</i>

25:44.041 --> 25:46.291
<i>There were also lighter showers in…</i>

25:50.791 --> 25:54.833
I've been wandering around town all day.
I didn't know where to go.

25:58.791 --> 26:00.458
My head's gonna explode.

26:00.958 --> 26:02.041
Tell me about it.

26:05.625 --> 26:08.375
Want a pill instead?
Belda gave me sleeping pills.

26:08.458 --> 26:09.375
No.

26:10.458 --> 26:12.666
I might not be her daughter,
but I'm turning into her,

26:12.750 --> 26:14.958
taking benzos to deal.

26:19.041 --> 26:20.041
Mar.

26:21.125 --> 26:22.416
Candela isn't well.

26:23.166 --> 26:25.708
-Maybe what she said was a delusion.
-No.

26:26.333 --> 26:28.250
No point in lying to myself. I tried.

26:29.583 --> 26:33.666
The bright side is I can't inherit
any traits from my asshat of a dad.

26:38.250 --> 26:41.208
If you're adopted, you can find out.

26:41.708 --> 26:44.125
-You have a right to. You're an adult.
-And then what?

26:46.000 --> 26:48.291
Imagine I find the parents
who didn't want me.

26:48.791 --> 26:49.916
What's the point?

26:51.666 --> 26:53.375
The only things I have are

26:54.083 --> 26:58.541
a house that looks like a church,
a crazy mom, and a dad who makes me sick.

27:00.208 --> 27:01.416
That's not true.

27:03.083 --> 27:04.416
You've got me too.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.666
-You can stay as long as you need.
-No.

27:10.666 --> 27:11.916
I don't wanna be a burden.

27:13.041 --> 27:16.416
Your sister… You've got
enough on your plate with her.

27:20.416 --> 27:22.541
I need to feel good about something.

27:26.208 --> 27:27.750
And the only good thing is you.

27:28.833 --> 27:30.250
It's all right, Eva.

27:30.958 --> 27:31.958
I can wait.

27:36.750 --> 27:37.750
I can't.

28:00.708 --> 28:03.708
She hasn't gotten out of bed all morning.
She didn't even eat.

28:10.333 --> 28:11.333
I'll be here.

28:23.625 --> 28:24.708
Can you hear me?

28:25.458 --> 28:26.666
My name is Estrella.

28:28.625 --> 28:31.000
I want to talk about
what's happening to you.

28:37.958 --> 28:39.541
I think I can help.

28:42.833 --> 28:45.500
You're not in control
of your actions, are you?

28:47.458 --> 28:50.291
"They placed an object
of great value in your body."

28:50.791 --> 28:53.416
"You, who have joined the perfect light,

28:54.125 --> 28:56.041
bring the angels to us."

28:56.625 --> 28:57.958
It's not an angel.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.458
It's a demon.

29:11.916 --> 29:13.375
It's eating away at me.

29:17.708 --> 29:21.416
They want you to convince
the others to go to their deaths,

29:22.625 --> 29:24.625
which is entering into the kingdom, right?

29:28.333 --> 29:30.958
-It's not inside me now.
-We're going to protect you.

29:31.458 --> 29:34.833
You won't be the vessel anymore.
Don't worry. You won't have to obey again.

29:34.916 --> 29:35.833
It's not inside.

29:35.916 --> 29:38.958
-We'll protect you.
-It's not inside me.

29:39.041 --> 29:41.541
But it'll come back
and make me take Sofía to the gates.

29:41.625 --> 29:42.666
What gates?

29:43.333 --> 29:46.041
What gates, Blanca?
What does Sofía have to do?

29:51.208 --> 29:53.291
Enough! Stop!

29:53.375 --> 29:54.916
-Stay still!
-Let me die!

29:55.416 --> 29:58.666
-Let me die before it comes back!
-Enough! No!

29:58.750 --> 29:59.750
No!

30:11.000 --> 30:12.416
Glycolic acid.

30:12.916 --> 30:14.916
It's a metabolite of GHB,

30:15.000 --> 30:18.208
a sedative that causes
loss of consciousness.

30:18.708 --> 30:19.541
Okay?

30:20.416 --> 30:21.666
And ergotamine.

30:22.166 --> 30:23.583
It's a hallucinogen.

30:27.583 --> 30:30.541
Eva told me what you <i>think</i> you saw.

30:32.583 --> 30:35.375
It's to be expected.
You needed an explanation, right?

30:36.083 --> 30:36.958
Well, this is it.

30:37.541 --> 30:39.750
It was a guided hallucination.

30:40.250 --> 30:42.708
Led by Samuel and the others,
but mostly Blanca.

30:42.791 --> 30:45.916
She was the one
who got you to have those visions.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Right?

30:47.625 --> 30:48.875
I'm still having them.

30:50.833 --> 30:52.500
Sofía, I saw things too.

30:53.125 --> 30:54.583
Things that weren't real.

30:55.333 --> 30:56.333
Remember?

30:57.416 --> 30:58.875
That bug under my skin?

31:02.250 --> 31:03.250
Dekta.

31:05.791 --> 31:07.458
Is that what Blanca called it?

31:14.208 --> 31:15.333
I know things…

31:17.333 --> 31:18.750
that no one told me.

31:21.375 --> 31:22.916
I don't know how. I just do.

31:25.041 --> 31:27.333
Like the names
of the archons of the kingdom.

31:29.166 --> 31:30.166
Dekta,

31:30.791 --> 31:31.791
Umma…

31:34.166 --> 31:35.375
I have no idea how.

31:37.083 --> 31:38.416
What else do you know?

31:38.500 --> 31:40.375
What were you doing with the cult?

31:41.291 --> 31:43.166
Were they preparing you for something?

31:46.000 --> 31:47.708
Don't feel sorry for them.

31:48.958 --> 31:50.333
They caused a lot of harm.

31:55.375 --> 31:56.500
Okay, don't worry.

32:05.583 --> 32:09.416
THE DAWN OF A NEW WORLD

32:48.458 --> 32:51.291
Don't make the same mistake
your mother did, you hear me?

32:52.958 --> 32:54.083
Don't believe them.

32:56.166 --> 32:58.208
How did they get Mom to do it?

32:58.916 --> 33:00.208
I don't know.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.666
I keep asking myself that.

33:03.875 --> 33:05.666
Your grandfather Valentín was…

33:07.166 --> 33:08.208
He was strange.

33:08.291 --> 33:12.083
He spent some time living in the mine,
hiding from the Franco regime.

33:13.666 --> 33:16.041
Your mother went to see him
every now and then, and…

33:17.666 --> 33:19.166
I don't know,

33:20.166 --> 33:23.625
maybe he told her about the cult.
I can't imagine who else would have.

33:23.708 --> 33:27.583
And she might have fallen prey
like you did, looking for a parent.

33:29.416 --> 33:30.416
I saw her.

33:31.833 --> 33:32.875
She was alive.

33:34.500 --> 33:37.375
-Where did you see her, honey?
-She was hallucinating.

33:37.458 --> 33:38.500
They drugged her.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.083
It doesn't matter what she saw.
What matters is who was running things.

33:43.166 --> 33:46.500
Sofía, tell your father. Was it Blanca?

33:50.333 --> 33:51.333
What'd she do to you?

33:54.333 --> 33:55.583
The veils of the light.

33:57.541 --> 33:58.541
There are five.

33:59.958 --> 34:02.166
The last one opens
the gate to the Solitary King.

34:02.791 --> 34:04.625
How many did you complete, Sofía?

34:07.041 --> 34:08.041
Four.

34:09.833 --> 34:12.166
That's what Elena
and Blanca did in the mine, right?

34:12.250 --> 34:14.458
The fifth veil,
making people kill themselves.

34:14.541 --> 34:15.625
I don't know.

34:16.458 --> 34:18.416
Sofía, don't you see this is crazy?

34:18.916 --> 34:20.250
There is no kingdom or anything.

34:20.333 --> 34:22.250
Sofía, look at me.

34:23.750 --> 34:25.375
They'll keep trying.

34:26.833 --> 34:28.791
You'll feel you have to do it.

34:30.125 --> 34:33.166
But no matter what,
do not complete the fifth veil.

34:35.375 --> 34:36.916
You won't save your mother.

34:38.208 --> 34:40.541
What you saw is no hallucination.

34:41.041 --> 34:43.166
The kingdom is real, and it's hell.

34:43.250 --> 34:45.291
-What the fuck?
-Don't go in there again!

34:45.375 --> 34:46.250
Take him away!

34:46.333 --> 34:47.458
My mother needs me!

34:47.541 --> 34:51.375
Mom sacrificed herself to close that gate.
Don't let her death be in vain.

34:51.458 --> 34:52.375
Shut your mouth!

34:52.458 --> 34:54.250
Don't open the last veil, Sofía!

34:55.166 --> 34:56.875
-Do you hear me?
-You son of a bitch!

34:56.958 --> 34:58.541
Do you want her to go insane?

34:59.708 --> 35:02.958
-Sofía, did you hear me?
-Get him out of here!

35:03.041 --> 35:05.375
Sofía, forget everything he said.

35:05.458 --> 35:07.583
He's with the cult. He's lying to us.

35:08.208 --> 35:09.041
Sofía.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.416
I did see Mom.
I know she's in the kingdom.

35:13.500 --> 35:15.708
For God's sake, stop talking crazy!

35:17.750 --> 35:19.208
It's just the two of us now.

35:23.333 --> 35:24.791
I won't leave her alone.

35:28.333 --> 35:29.333
No.

35:31.625 --> 35:34.958
And what are you gonna do?
Kill yourself, just like her?

35:36.541 --> 35:40.208
That's the fifth veil, right?
You'll kill yourself to be with her?

35:40.791 --> 35:43.083
Get out of my way
if you don't want to get hurt.

35:43.916 --> 35:45.666
You'll have to hurt me, then.

35:55.500 --> 35:56.500
<i>Honey.</i>

35:57.541 --> 35:59.166
<i>Come to me.</i>

35:59.250 --> 36:01.166
<i>I need to hold you.</i>

36:25.750 --> 36:28.208
You've lost it.
No way you're that much of a jerk.

36:28.291 --> 36:31.166
-You don't get it.
-Of course I don't!

36:31.250 --> 36:34.041
Your daughter is this close to the edge,
and what do you do?

36:34.125 --> 36:35.000
You push her over.

36:35.083 --> 36:38.500
-Feed into her fantasies.
-I told her that to help her.

36:38.583 --> 36:42.458
Making her believe she can open a gate
to hell with superpowers is great therapy.

36:42.541 --> 36:44.458
It's the fucking truth!

36:44.541 --> 36:46.333
It's fucking true!

36:48.500 --> 36:51.000
Isn't that what you wanted?
Well, there you have it.

36:53.083 --> 36:54.958
What did they make you believe?

36:59.166 --> 37:00.500
Elena knew it.

37:01.458 --> 37:04.916
I thought we could live with the secret
and that it was all over.

37:05.833 --> 37:08.166
But it never ends. It never ends.

37:08.666 --> 37:10.291
They'll use Sofía to open the gate.

37:10.375 --> 37:12.208
But who? Who will use her?

37:12.291 --> 37:15.375
Blanca? She's in the hospital.
She attempted suicide.

37:15.458 --> 37:17.625
Who are you afraid of, Pablo? Samuel?

37:18.291 --> 37:19.291
Dekta? A god?

37:21.375 --> 37:24.000
"And from the cloud appeared an angel

37:24.541 --> 37:28.041
whose face spouted fire
and whose body was defiled with blood."

37:28.125 --> 37:29.291
"And he was called…

37:32.000 --> 37:33.041
Yaldabaoth."

37:35.541 --> 37:38.166
You're talking about a snake
with a lion's head!

37:38.250 --> 37:39.666
I saw them, Guillén.

37:39.750 --> 37:41.666
Just like Sofía did.

37:44.291 --> 37:46.833
They're demons. That's the kingdom.

37:46.916 --> 37:49.250
The cult's going to let them
into our world.

37:50.916 --> 37:53.541
You need psychological help
or a fucking straitjacket.

37:53.625 --> 37:56.291
When the cycle is completed
before the temple's gate,

37:56.375 --> 37:58.541
the Solitary King will come
with all the stars

37:58.625 --> 38:00.541
and will fulfill the prophecy.

38:01.958 --> 38:03.666
It's the fucking apocalypse.

38:04.750 --> 38:05.750
Pablo.

38:07.500 --> 38:08.791
Guillén, please.

38:10.458 --> 38:13.083
Keep my daughter away from the temple.

38:13.708 --> 38:14.833
Please, Guillén.

38:14.916 --> 38:16.041
What temple?

38:26.375 --> 38:28.208
We went over 500 meters in.

38:28.958 --> 38:31.833
We didn't find
Elena's body or that temple.

38:40.875 --> 38:41.875
Let's head in.

39:44.875 --> 39:46.916
My patience is running thin, Pablo.

39:52.416 --> 39:53.416
Here it is.

39:53.916 --> 39:55.333
It's here. This is it.

39:57.125 --> 39:59.541
This is it.

41:21.416 --> 41:23.666
What the hell is this place?

42:45.333 --> 42:47.166
Sofía, what are you doing?

42:54.250 --> 42:55.416
You're not yourself.

42:57.416 --> 42:59.333
This is all your fault.

43:00.541 --> 43:01.541
My fault?

43:01.625 --> 43:02.583
What?

43:03.625 --> 43:05.125
What's my fault?

43:05.958 --> 43:07.291
Wanna kill me?

43:08.708 --> 43:09.833
Fine.

43:09.916 --> 43:11.791
Do it. Come on!

43:11.875 --> 43:13.291
Go ahead, kill me!

43:13.833 --> 43:15.125
Kill me!

43:23.833 --> 43:24.958
Drop the knife.

43:26.166 --> 43:27.208
Sofía.

43:32.666 --> 43:33.666
Sofía.

43:34.791 --> 43:35.875
I love you.

43:36.375 --> 43:37.666
Please drop it.

43:38.583 --> 43:41.000
Eva? What's going on?

43:41.875 --> 43:43.083
Call the police.

44:22.875 --> 44:23.958
Get a rag!

44:26.416 --> 44:28.791
This can't be happening. No.

48:06.375 --> 48:09.291
