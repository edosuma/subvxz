00:19.900 --> 00:22.100
I'll be back!
I'm free!

00:25.633 --> 00:27.533
No!

01:44.866 --> 01:47.733
Come on, come on.
Come on, I'm gonna miss it.

01:50.666 --> 01:51.633
Hallelujah.

02:16.200 --> 02:18.733
'And now it's time to announce
this week's winning numbers.'

02:20.033 --> 02:21.966
Power positive thinking.
Power positive thinking.

02:22.033 --> 02:23.100
Power positive thinking.

02:23.166 --> 02:24.366
'And I'm sure
you folks out there'

02:24.433 --> 02:26.300
'wanna know how much
this week's jackpot is.'

02:26.366 --> 02:28.200
Twenty-three million,
twenty-three million.

02:28.266 --> 02:29.666
'Twenty-three million dollars.'

02:29.733 --> 02:30.700
Twenty-three million.

02:30.766 --> 02:32.033
'Buys a lotta dreams, don't it?'

02:32.100 --> 02:33.300
It's a start, buddy.

02:33.366 --> 02:36.200
'Okay, no further delay.
Here we go, five magic numbers.'

02:36.266 --> 02:37.500
- 'And the first one is..'
- Eight.

02:37.566 --> 02:39.633
Eight, eight, eight.

02:39.700 --> 02:42.000
- 'Eight.'
- E-eight!

02:42.066 --> 02:44.000
Oh. Alright, okay.

02:44.066 --> 02:45.833
Give me a 13, give me a 13,
give me a 13.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.766
'The second number
is a lucky 13.'

02:48.833 --> 02:52.066
Thirteen! Oh, my God, uh,
give me a six, give me a six.

02:52.133 --> 02:53.600
One less than seven,
one more than five.

02:53.666 --> 02:55.500
Come on, come on, come on,
God bless the working..

02:55.566 --> 02:57.700
'Alright, half way there.
Get ready.'

02:57.766 --> 02:59.233
Six, I'm ready,
ready, I'm ready.

02:59.300 --> 03:00.966
'The third number is..'

03:01.033 --> 03:02.233
Six, six, six!

03:02.300 --> 03:04.833
'Nine! A big nine
for number three.'

03:06.500 --> 03:08.900
'And the final
two numbers are..'

03:08.966 --> 03:11.066
'...one and 15.'

03:11.133 --> 03:13.633
'Congratulations to our winners
wherever they are.'

03:13.700 --> 03:15.466
'And now back to our
regular program.'

03:25.366 --> 03:28.466
Honey. You said you'd have this
pressed for today.

03:28.533 --> 03:29.566
Oh, I'm sorry, Tom.

03:29.633 --> 03:31.166
Leave it with me,
I'll do it when I get home.

03:31.233 --> 03:33.866
Come on, I specifically told you
I wanted this shirt today.

03:33.933 --> 03:35.900
This one, you said no problem.

03:35.966 --> 03:39.200
- Take one of the others.
- The others.

03:39.266 --> 03:41.033
This is my good luck exam shirt.

03:41.100 --> 03:43.100
I have a killer final today.
What happened?

03:44.600 --> 03:46.100
Oh, I see.

03:46.166 --> 03:48.500
You're still writing away
to game shows, hm?

03:48.566 --> 03:49.900
"Let's Make A Date."

03:49.966 --> 03:52.733
Oh, here's a good one.
"Diggity Dollars."

03:52.800 --> 03:55.366
God save me from lotteries
and slick emcees.

03:55.433 --> 03:57.800
Let me get some coffee in me
before you start the lecture.

03:57.866 --> 03:59.066
I have work today.

03:59.133 --> 04:01.833
Here we go again, you have work.
What do I do? Sunbathe?

04:02.566 --> 04:04.200
You go to school, Tom.

04:04.266 --> 04:06.333
School is work.

04:09.033 --> 04:10.266
When your hands look like mine

04:10.333 --> 04:11.900
then you can tell me
that you work.

04:11.966 --> 04:13.933
Fine, fine.

04:14.966 --> 04:16.900
Tom. I didn't mean it.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.500
Guess who's behind
door number one?

04:28.566 --> 04:32.366
That's right, Judy Miller,
come on down.

04:48.166 --> 04:49.533
Something wrong?

04:49.600 --> 04:51.900
I found ants here, filthy.

04:51.966 --> 04:54.400
We must keep things clean.

04:54.466 --> 04:56.533
And I smell salt.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.533
- Can't have salt.
- We can't have salt.

05:01.366 --> 05:02.700
There's no salt

05:02.766 --> 05:06.133
and there are no ants, mother.

05:07.466 --> 05:10.300
I hope you're
taking care of Tom.

05:10.366 --> 05:12.700
'He's always had such dreams.'

05:14.366 --> 05:16.700
Must run in the family.

05:16.766 --> 05:18.400
Don't forget his dry cleaning.

05:18.466 --> 05:19.700
If you can keep your mind off of

05:19.766 --> 05:21.933
rushing to see those
dumb game shows.

05:23.033 --> 05:25.033
It's silly even to hope.

05:25.100 --> 05:27.633
Everyone knows
they're all fixed.

05:28.333 --> 05:30.300
So is life.

05:49.900 --> 05:52.166
'Now it's time
to test your minds'

05:52.233 --> 05:54.633
'and play America's
favorite game show'

05:54.700 --> 05:56.333
'"Beat The House."'

05:56.400 --> 05:58.333
'With your host, the honorable'

05:58.400 --> 06:01.333
'the excitable, Sammy Ray.'

06:03.566 --> 06:05.033
Hey, hey, hey.

06:05.100 --> 06:08.300
'And his lovely co-host,
Sheena.'

06:09.266 --> 06:10.333
Thank you very much.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.100
Welcome, everybody,
and welcome, Sheena.

06:12.166 --> 06:13.333
It's time to play..

06:13.400 --> 06:14.933
'"Beat The House."'

06:15.000 --> 06:16.300
You got it!

06:16.366 --> 06:18.900
But first, let's meet our three
contestants right over here.

06:18.966 --> 06:21.333
'Let's say hello to,
Ivy Feldman.'

06:22.600 --> 06:24.233
- 'Ivy Feldman..'
- 'Turn that down!'

06:24.300 --> 06:26.733
'...recently won the state
Blue Ribbon Chili Bake Off.'

06:26.800 --> 06:29.166
'Mother of three and grandmother
of five she said'

06:29.233 --> 06:30.533
'she is looking for a man
who likes to sleep late.'

06:30.600 --> 06:32.966
Where were you?

06:33.033 --> 06:34.700
Celebrating.

06:37.500 --> 06:40.000
I washed out.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.300
I sat down to take the test,
and I drew a blank.

06:45.300 --> 06:47.466
You stay the bread winner.

06:47.533 --> 06:49.866
You Tarzan, me Jane.

06:49.933 --> 06:53.033
- No, no, Tom, don't.
- No, no, it's okay.

06:53.866 --> 06:55.366
No, don't.

06:55.433 --> 06:57.766
Oh, of course.

06:57.833 --> 07:00.900
Judy Miller, come on down.

07:00.966 --> 07:03.766
Tom, ju.. Enough.

07:03.833 --> 07:05.966
After work all day
and your parents in betwee

07:06.033 --> 07:08.700
I don't need
your self-pity tonight.

07:08.766 --> 07:09.866
'You're always complaining.'

07:09.933 --> 07:12.333
My folks let us live here
for nothing.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.833
No, Tom, you live here.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.233
I cook here and clean here

07:15.300 --> 07:17.700
and put mama's little boy
through law school.

07:17.766 --> 07:20.066
I wish you'd all just
get out of my life.

07:20.133 --> 07:21.666
What are you talking about?

07:21.733 --> 07:25.133
Tom, you have your dreams.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.733
I'm left with one thing,
wishing.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.400
You promised to love me,
and then you forgot who I am.

07:31.333 --> 07:33.300
'Remember my dreams, Tom?'

07:34.133 --> 07:37.533
You remember me? When's my turn?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.933
I have to sleep.

07:44.066 --> 07:46.033
I have an early class
in the morning.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.400
When's my turn?

08:24.366 --> 08:26.433
Hey, hey, well, folks, next week
starts an all new round

08:26.500 --> 08:27.500
with all new faces.

08:27.566 --> 08:29.033
'Who will be here
to share the fun?'

08:29.100 --> 08:31.533
While we received so many
postcards, we can only select

08:31.600 --> 08:34.033
three lucky winners,
and here's our first one

08:34.100 --> 08:36.266
from Springwood,
Mrs. Judy Miller.

08:48.633 --> 08:51.066
'and play America's
favorite game show'

08:51.133 --> 08:52.600
'"Beat The House!"'

08:52.666 --> 08:54.700
'With your host, the honorable'

08:54.766 --> 08:57.900
'the excitable, Sammy Ray.'

08:59.766 --> 09:01.366
Hey, hey, hey.

09:01.433 --> 09:04.633
'And his lovely co-host,
Sheena.'

09:05.633 --> 09:06.700
Thank you very much.

09:06.766 --> 09:08.400
Welcome, everybody,
and welcome, Sheena.

09:08.466 --> 09:09.633
It's time to play..

09:09.700 --> 09:11.333
'"Beat The House!"'

09:11.400 --> 09:12.700
You got it!

09:12.766 --> 09:15.266
But first, let's meet our three
contestants right over here.

09:15.333 --> 09:16.766
Say hello to our returning champ

09:16.833 --> 09:18.666
all the way from
Hackensack, New Jersey

09:18.733 --> 09:20.300
Dora Rubenstein.

09:20.366 --> 09:21.900
'Dora's a cash register

09:20.366 --> 09:21.900
operator'

09:21.966 --> 09:23.866
'for a leading foodstore.'

09:23.933 --> 09:25.866
And then there's Sherry,
who joins us all the way

09:25.933 --> 09:27.833
from Knotsville, Tennessee.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.933
'Sherry is a maker

09:27.900 --> 09:29.933
of fine needle craft'

09:30.000 --> 09:31.666
'and is the Tennessee
cow tipping champion.'

09:31.733 --> 09:33.466
And finally, our lovely newcomer

09:33.533 --> 09:35.000
all the way from Springwood USA

09:35.066 --> 09:36.500
Judy Miller.

09:36.566 --> 09:38.200
'Judy lives

09:36.566 --> 09:38.200
a existence.'

09:38.266 --> 09:41.000
'All her hopes stripped away by
the uncaring folks around her.'

09:41.066 --> 09:42.700
Now, don't be nervous, Judy.

09:42.766 --> 09:44.200
It's time to play..

09:44.266 --> 09:46.100
'"Beat The House!"'

09:46.166 --> 09:48.200
You got it!

09:48.266 --> 09:49.833
Best audience
in the business.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.733
Alright, then,
let's get started.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.633
Now, you all know
how our game is played.

09:55.700 --> 09:58.033
Each of our high rollers
gets to spin for a category

09:58.100 --> 09:59.133
'on the wheel of knowledge.'

09:59.200 --> 10:00.500
'Now, each question
and each category'

10:00.566 --> 10:02.966
has its own odds
of being answered correctly.

10:03.033 --> 10:05.133
The higher the odds,
the higher the points.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.566
And the bigger prize you get.

10:06.633 --> 10:08.300
So are we ready to start, Dora?

10:08.366 --> 10:11.500
You bet.
Give it a spin, Sheena.

10:26.766 --> 10:29.300
Alright, Dora,
you have to face the facts.

10:29.366 --> 10:31.033
Here is your question.

10:31.100 --> 10:33.600
Now, Dora, remember the odds
on this one are fairly steep.

10:33.666 --> 10:36.600
Sixty-five to three here.
So listen carefully.

10:36.666 --> 10:39.933
The question is, "Who was tried
in White Plains, New York

10:40.000 --> 10:42.533
"in 1934, for multiple murders

10:42.600 --> 10:43.533
and one act of.."

10:43.600 --> 10:44.600
yum-yum

10:44.666 --> 10:45.633
"...cannibalism?"

10:53.133 --> 10:55.533
Aw, that's too bad, Dora.
You didn't get it in time.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.466
The correct answer
was Albert Fish.

10:57.533 --> 10:58.933
'Albert Fish,
ladies and gentlemen.'

10:59.000 --> 11:01.266
A man you would definitely
not want to do lunch with.

11:02.366 --> 11:03.666
Alright, we're moving
right along.

11:03.733 --> 11:05.566
Judy, moving to you.
Are you ready for us?

11:05.633 --> 11:07.400
'Cause we're ready for you.

11:07.466 --> 11:09.733
- Spin away.
- Okay.

11:24.733 --> 11:28.233
Alright, Judy, your category
is boulevard of broken dreams.

11:28.300 --> 11:30.000
'Here is your
question now, Judy.'

11:30.066 --> 11:32.033
This one has odds
of twenty-five to seven.

11:32.100 --> 11:34.466
Rather reasonable, so listen.
Here we go.

11:34.533 --> 11:37.866
"What 1950s movie star had
his career tragically cut short

11:37.933 --> 11:40.533
after starring
injus

11:46.300 --> 11:47.600
- James Dean.
- 'That's right!'

11:47.666 --> 11:50.766
Correct! And you've won
25 points and a terrific prize.

11:50.833 --> 11:52.766
'Tell the lady what she's won!'

11:52.833 --> 11:53.933
'Alright, Sammy.'

11:54.000 --> 11:56.366
'Judy's won an all-paid semester
of night classes'

11:56.433 --> 11:58.133
'at her local university.'

11:58.200 --> 11:59.866
'Now she won't have to
just sit at home and rot'

11:59.933 --> 12:01.833
'while her hubby
plays at school.'

12:03.633 --> 12:05.600
Are you ready to go on?

12:06.666 --> 12:09.166
I said,
"Are you ready to go on?"

12:09.233 --> 12:10.866
Nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

12:10.933 --> 12:12.900
I-I-I'll go on.

12:14.833 --> 12:17.533
Attagirl! Are you staying
with the same category, Judy?

12:18.533 --> 12:20.100
- I know this one.
- 'Okay.'

12:20.166 --> 12:23.033
Alright, then we're selling that
old boulevard of broken dreams.

12:23.100 --> 12:27.366
Your next question is worth
a whopping 101. Here we go.

12:27.433 --> 12:29.966
Who are the people
that are making your life

12:30.033 --> 12:31.533
a living hell?

12:32.533 --> 12:34.233
Excuse me?

12:34.300 --> 12:37.900
Who are the people
who treat you like chattel

12:37.966 --> 12:41.133
and have contributed
to your oppressive existence?

12:43.066 --> 12:46.433
Are these questions
supposed to be so personal?

12:46.500 --> 12:49.133
Hey, hey.
You wanna win, dreams cost!

12:50.500 --> 12:53.466
I'll repeat. Who are the sources
of your daily aggravation?

12:53.533 --> 12:56.666
Who is continually causing
problems in your marriage?

12:56.733 --> 12:59.100
Who is it, Judy? Who?

12:59.166 --> 13:01.366
- My in-laws!
- Yes!

13:01.433 --> 13:04.466
Tell the lady what she's won!

13:04.533 --> 13:07.233
'A soon to be empty house.'

13:11.133 --> 13:13.233
'By the way, Sam,
that honey she's using..'

13:13.300 --> 13:15.400
'...is taken from
the fabulous worker bees'

13:15.466 --> 13:16.666
'of the South Pacific.'

13:16.733 --> 13:18.433
'Rich in both texture
and flavor'

13:18.500 --> 13:21.833
'it's the brand
preferred by most Americans.'

13:30.900 --> 13:32.200
Stop this!

13:32.266 --> 13:34.533
Oh. You asked for it.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.666
I wish you'd all
just get out of my life.

13:37.833 --> 13:39.966
See. What do you think,
audience?

13:40.033 --> 13:41.000
Thumbs up?

13:42.100 --> 13:43.433
Thumbs down?

13:44.533 --> 13:46.666
Sheena..

13:46.733 --> 13:47.900
'The lovely Sheena is using'

13:47.966 --> 13:50.000
'deadly South American
red devil ants'

13:50.066 --> 13:52.933
'and well, well, that can chop
away the flesh of any animal'

13:53.000 --> 13:55.700
'leave a gleaning carcass
in under 15 minutes.'

13:55.766 --> 13:58.266
'Busy little devils,
but they get the job done.'

13:58.333 --> 14:00.033
'No picnic when these fellows
are up and around.'

14:00.100 --> 14:01.300
Stop this!

14:01.366 --> 14:03.266
'Let's hear it
for the deadly red ants.'

14:32.733 --> 14:35.633
Don't worry.
All these shows are fixed.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.133
Bert?

15:27.333 --> 15:28.300
Gladys?

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Bert?

15:44.733 --> 15:45.733
Gladys?

16:22.033 --> 16:24.233
What did you do?

16:55.333 --> 16:57.233
'And now back
to "Beat The Reaper"'

16:57.300 --> 16:59.900
'with your host Sammy Ray.'

17:04.666 --> 17:05.933
Get away.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.033
Hey, hey.

17:17.466 --> 17:19.400
You are at the lightning round.

17:19.466 --> 17:20.866
Stop this.

17:20.933 --> 17:23.066
But we save the best for last.

17:23.133 --> 17:24.100
Sheena.

17:34.066 --> 17:35.566
Aren't we devils?

17:35.633 --> 17:37.666
Okay, Judy, the lightning
round is fairly simple.

17:37.733 --> 17:39.366
As our new winner,
you get a spin on the wheel

17:39.433 --> 17:40.733
and five quick questions.

17:40.800 --> 17:43.000
Answer them all
correctly and you win.

17:43.066 --> 17:44.166
Miss one..

17:45.300 --> 17:47.666
...and slice-slice.

17:48.866 --> 17:50.200
Are you ready?

17:54.400 --> 17:55.800
Spin away.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.233
Okay, Judy,
your favorite category.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.233
Life. Can we have
the timer please?

18:21.133 --> 18:22.500
Alright, let's go.

18:22.566 --> 18:25.400
Who, when he proposed promised
to be the keeper of your dreams?

18:25.466 --> 18:26.700
- He meant it.
- 'Who did?'

18:26.766 --> 18:28.500
- Tom.
- Yes.

18:28.566 --> 18:31.533
Number two, who said he'd never
make you live with his parents?

18:35.833 --> 18:37.700
He tried. I-I should
be more understanding.

18:37.766 --> 18:39.800
- 'Who was it?'
- Tom.

18:39.866 --> 18:41.800
Yes.
Ha ha ha.

18:41.866 --> 18:43.933
But I'm winning.
The blade's still going down.

18:47.733 --> 18:49.533
Number three,
who forget your birthday?

18:49.600 --> 18:51.100
Who never takes you out anymore?

18:52.733 --> 18:54.066
He's under a lot of pressure.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.966
Oh, he's under
a lot more than that, Judy.

18:56.033 --> 18:57.600
Answer the question,
the clock is ticking.

18:57.666 --> 18:59.300
- Tommy.
- Yes! Ha ha ha!

19:02.666 --> 19:05.533
If I win, he dies.

19:05.600 --> 19:06.900
- Who do you love?
- Tom.

19:08.300 --> 19:10.933
And lastly, who do you
want out of your life?

19:12.700 --> 19:14.233
I never meant that.

19:14.300 --> 19:16.233
I said, "Who do you
want out of your life?"

19:19.266 --> 19:20.366
You!

19:20.433 --> 19:22.200
Oh.

19:22.266 --> 19:24.600
Judy, you
didn't answer correctly.

19:24.666 --> 19:27.533
You could've had an empty house.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.066
I don't need one,
there's room enough

19:29.133 --> 19:31.100
for that man and my dreams.

19:38.500 --> 19:41.366
Congratulations, you answered
all the five questions..

19:41.433 --> 19:45.966
...grand prize winner
of one million dollars!

19:46.033 --> 19:47.500
What a pro.

19:47.566 --> 19:48.866
What happened?

19:48.933 --> 19:51.600
What happened? You answered
them all correctly.

19:51.666 --> 19:53.433
You're our winner.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.033
I am? I won?

19:55.100 --> 19:56.100
Yes!

19:57.100 --> 19:59.533
Now you can buy your dream.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.833
And share them.

20:01.633 --> 20:03.233
Goodbye, everybody.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.066
Come on, Tommy.

20:36.133 --> 20:37.433
Come on, Tommy, we're rich now.

20:37.500 --> 20:38.933
Come on!

20:39.000 --> 20:40.233
Come on.

20:57.900 --> 20:59.566
Great.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.633
Now she really is
the bread winner, huh?

21:03.533 --> 21:05.500
I can't even be the man.

21:07.733 --> 21:09.300
I wish I never met her.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.733
Hey, hey, hey!

21:11.800 --> 21:13.933
Have I got
a game for you!

21:22.700 --> 21:25.666
Say this ain't white,
and you get to play my show.

21:25.733 --> 21:27.566
"The Slice Is Right!"

21:51.166 --> 21:53.200
'Look at all this stuff.'

22:50.266 --> 22:52.266
The spoils of war.

22:52.333 --> 22:54.033
- If this is war, I surrender.
- Oh..

22:54.100 --> 22:55.700
- Hmm?
- Oh, God.

22:55.766 --> 22:57.666
Let me catch my breath.

22:57.733 --> 22:59.000
If I knew it was
gonna be like this

22:59.066 --> 23:01.033
I would've won
a million bucks years ago.

23:01.100 --> 23:02.833
Forget the money.

23:02.900 --> 23:04.233
This is my way of apologizing.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.600
I owe you for laughing at
all your game shows, remember?

23:06.666 --> 23:09.466
Yeah? Apology accepted.

23:09.533 --> 23:10.933
- Mm.
- Mm.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.800
And you thought I was gonna
take my winnings and leave you.

23:13.866 --> 23:15.133
Well, you got to admit
having your wife

23:15.200 --> 23:16.400
win a million bucks
on a game show

23:16.466 --> 23:17.433
can be a little threatening.

23:17.500 --> 23:20.600
It's ours together.
To share.

23:21.866 --> 23:23.100
It's just the beginning.

23:23.166 --> 23:25.233
Now all our dreams
are gonna come true.

23:25.300 --> 23:27.233
Like sending my folks
to live in a condo in Miami.

23:27.300 --> 23:30.566
Okay. So we started with
one of my dreams first.

23:30.633 --> 23:31.600
Sue me.

23:31.666 --> 23:34.233
Besides...they'll love it there.

23:35.733 --> 23:36.800
I love them there, too.

23:49.866 --> 23:52.533
Be careful what you wish for.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.533
You might get it.

24:40.266 --> 24:41.933
What do you think?

24:46.933 --> 24:50.800
Oh, Tommy,
you gorgeous thing you.

24:50.866 --> 24:53.066
I'll make you an offer
you can't refuse.

24:53.133 --> 24:54.433
Ooh.

25:03.433 --> 25:05.433
See, I told you
this was a good idea.

25:07.066 --> 25:08.500
Honey, we're having
a lot of fun with this money

25:08.566 --> 25:10.533
but we're not making any trips
to the bank.

25:10.600 --> 25:11.533
Ooh.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.100
Check this out.

25:14.166 --> 25:16.366
Oh boy, am I hungry.

25:16.433 --> 25:18.433
'Allow me to cook
your food for you.'

25:20.666 --> 25:22.266
Technology at it's best,
or what?

25:22.333 --> 25:23.600
Great. Now the diswasher
won't be lonely.

25:23.666 --> 25:24.633
Hmm.

25:24.700 --> 25:26.133
I don't mean to rain
on this parade

25:26.200 --> 25:27.300
but don't you think
we should stop spending

25:27.366 --> 25:28.933
some of this money
on luxury items?

25:29.000 --> 25:30.766
Well, we will, sweetheart.

25:30.833 --> 25:31.833
Next week.

25:36.066 --> 25:37.366
I can see this
is a losing argument.

25:37.433 --> 25:39.133
- Yeah, you're right.
- Mmm.

25:41.233 --> 25:42.200
I gotta go.

25:42.266 --> 25:43.833
I'll call you at lunch.

25:43.900 --> 25:45.500
I'll be here.
I'm waiting for the maid.

25:45.566 --> 25:46.900
The what?

25:46.966 --> 25:48.533
I hired a maid.

25:48.600 --> 25:50.566
Just for a little bit
till you finish law school

25:50.633 --> 25:53.666
and I become a woman of leisure.

25:53.733 --> 25:55.666
A woman of leisure.

25:56.766 --> 25:57.733
Hmm.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.100
Oh, you better go.

26:09.866 --> 26:11.200
A maid?

26:43.900 --> 26:46.200
I'm from the agency.

26:46.266 --> 26:47.633
May I come in?

26:49.100 --> 26:51.800
Uh, yes, I'm sorry, uh..

26:56.100 --> 26:58.100
I'll start in the kitchen.

27:05.166 --> 27:06.366
I'm telling you, Tom

27:06.433 --> 27:08.366
there's something really weird
about this woman.

27:08.433 --> 27:09.666
'Well, as her to leave.'

27:09.733 --> 27:11.833
- On what grounds?
- 'On no grounds.'

27:11.900 --> 27:13.633
'She gives you the creeps.
That's enough.'

27:13.700 --> 27:15.666
I can't just kick her out.

27:15.733 --> 27:17.500
She looks so sad.

27:17.566 --> 27:19.766
'Maybe she's lonely. Tell her
to talk to the microwave.'

27:19.833 --> 27:22.100
- Wise guy.
- 'I gotta go, babe.'

27:22.166 --> 27:23.233
- 'I'll see you later.'
- I love..

27:24.333 --> 27:25.300
...you.

27:32.366 --> 27:34.666
What happened?
Is everything alright?

27:34.733 --> 27:36.600
Yes. Uh, I'm-I'm sorry.

27:36.666 --> 27:38.766
It slipped out of my hands.

27:38.833 --> 27:40.833
'Be careful.
I'll be right down.'

27:44.100 --> 27:47.000
It's nothing really.
I have better pots on the way.

27:49.166 --> 27:50.766
Oh, look.
Isn't that funny?

27:50.833 --> 27:52.800
You have the same scar as I do.

27:54.866 --> 27:56.800
We got it when we were 12.

27:56.866 --> 27:59.200
When Billy Frank
pushed us off the swing.

28:01.266 --> 28:02.233
We?

28:04.266 --> 28:06.233
I've come a long long way.

28:07.733 --> 28:09.733
Get out of here.

28:21.933 --> 28:24.466
This some kind of a sick joke.
Who the hell are you?

28:24.533 --> 28:27.133
We were born August 13th 1963.

28:27.200 --> 28:29.200
Our mother died in childbirth.

28:29.266 --> 28:31.600
- We grew up in Springwood.
- Shut up.

28:31.666 --> 28:33.066
We must talk.

28:33.133 --> 28:35.100
I've come a long way.

29:00.866 --> 29:02.800
Shall I go on with our past?

29:02.866 --> 29:05.233
No.

29:05.300 --> 29:07.333
I believe you are me.

29:10.033 --> 29:11.000
Good.

29:11.066 --> 29:12.266
Now we can talk
about the future.

29:12.333 --> 29:13.633
Our future.

29:17.700 --> 29:19.400
I know what you're thinking.

29:19.466 --> 29:20.966
You've won a million dollars.

29:21.033 --> 29:23.033
You think you can
buy off your problems.

29:23.100 --> 29:24.066
His problems.

29:24.133 --> 29:26.066
Make love all night,
raise a family.

29:26.133 --> 29:28.066
No more in-laws in the way.

29:28.133 --> 29:29.100
Together forever.

29:29.166 --> 29:30.466
What's wrong with that?

29:30.533 --> 29:31.966
The money didn't help.

29:32.033 --> 29:34.533
It just.. It just hid
what was really going on

29:34.600 --> 29:37.500
and-and created greed.

29:37.566 --> 29:38.633
Tom would never..

29:38.700 --> 29:42.466
Tom will begin to control you
as he did before.

29:42.533 --> 29:46.066
You will begin to resent
his involvement.

29:46.133 --> 29:48.866
Especially now, as
you consider yourself wealthy.

29:48.933 --> 29:51.100
He will look
less princely in your eyes

29:51.166 --> 29:52.433
as you see that, that sharing

29:52.500 --> 29:53.500
isn't all that is
cracked up to be..

29:53.566 --> 29:56.200
- Never.
- He will take a mistress.

29:57.300 --> 30:00.133
And she will want it all.

30:00.200 --> 30:02.366
A young girl..

30:02.433 --> 30:04.733
...with dreams like yours.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.966
She will, she will see money
as your answer and push Tom

30:10.033 --> 30:12.233
to erase your involvement.

30:17.600 --> 30:21.366
As years pass, you'll grow
to hate his presence.

30:21.433 --> 30:25.300
And then you'll discover
his plot to remove you.

30:25.366 --> 30:27.533
But you'll remove him first.

30:31.300 --> 30:33.500
I know it's hard to take.

30:33.566 --> 30:35.400
'Right now, you're young,
you're in love'

30:35.466 --> 30:37.300
you're bonded together.

30:37.366 --> 30:39.700
Your dreams are in your minds,
in your hearts.

30:41.066 --> 30:43.100
- Why?
- The money.

30:43.166 --> 30:44.500
The prize.

30:44.566 --> 30:47.166
It bought you your dreams.

30:47.233 --> 30:49.166
Bought dreams can't be shared.

30:49.233 --> 30:51.166
They can only be owned.

30:51.233 --> 30:54.100
And there can be only one owner.

30:54.166 --> 30:57.000
You killed him.

30:57.066 --> 30:58.666
We did.

30:58.733 --> 31:01.833
I ran after I did it.
I ran and I never stopped.

31:01.900 --> 31:03.633
'And here I am.'

31:03.700 --> 31:05.466
I don't know how

31:05.533 --> 31:08.866
but somehow
here is our second chance.

31:08.933 --> 31:10.500
What are you talking about?

31:10.566 --> 31:13.133
If I could convince you,
to know what to expect

31:13.200 --> 31:16.400
to, to stay with you,
to, to keep things on the track

31:16.466 --> 31:18.633
I can save us both.

31:18.700 --> 31:20.766
We can save our dreams.

31:20.833 --> 31:22.366
'Keep the blood off them.'

31:22.433 --> 31:24.366
How?

31:24.433 --> 31:27.266
You'll have to give it all up.

31:27.333 --> 31:30.200
The money, the temptation.

31:31.700 --> 31:34.066
Judy, if you, if you shut me out

31:34.133 --> 31:35.633
we're lost.

31:35.700 --> 31:37.900
No, you're lost.

31:37.966 --> 31:39.733
Not me, not Tom.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.866
I fought like a dog
for two and half years

31:41.933 --> 31:44.666
to keep Tom and me together.

31:44.733 --> 31:46.666
There was never any time
for just us.

31:46.733 --> 31:49.600
It was always his work,
his parents.

31:49.666 --> 31:52.333
And now, finally,
the one lucky thing

31:52.400 --> 31:56.133
that ever happens
to me happens, I win.

31:56.200 --> 32:00.466
I finally think that
somebody up there likes me.

32:00.533 --> 32:02.000
And then you come here

32:02.066 --> 32:05.166
and you tell me
that if I don't give it all back

32:05.233 --> 32:07.200
I'm gonna kill my husband?

32:09.400 --> 32:10.700
Screw you.

32:12.933 --> 32:14.433
Get out of here!
Just go back to your own!

32:14.500 --> 32:16.533
And get the hell away from me!

32:25.800 --> 32:27.433
Tom.

32:27.500 --> 32:30.333
Tommy.

32:33.300 --> 32:35.700
Judy?

32:35.766 --> 32:38.066
- Judy!
- Get out of here.

32:38.133 --> 32:40.533
You just leave me alone!

32:40.600 --> 32:43.433
Listen to me.
I'll only say one more thing.

32:43.500 --> 32:46.633
In about 60 seconds
the phone will ring.

32:46.700 --> 32:49.133
After you talk to the person
on the other end

32:49.200 --> 32:51.866
if you still want me to leave

32:51.933 --> 32:53.233
I will.

32:54.733 --> 32:57.033
I'll be waiting
for you downstairs.

33:01.800 --> 33:03.200
Crazy woman.

33:15.733 --> 33:16.733
Hello.

33:20.766 --> 33:21.733
Yes.

33:54.866 --> 33:58.600
- When did we start smoking?
- 1994.

33:59.966 --> 34:01.033
Well?

34:03.066 --> 34:05.666
You know who that was
on the phone.

34:05.733 --> 34:07.100
Tell me anyway.

34:09.266 --> 34:11.100
Our banker.

34:11.166 --> 34:12.766
He said that
Tom came in this morning

34:12.833 --> 34:14.266
and opened up an account.

34:14.333 --> 34:17.133
Deposited part of my..

34:17.200 --> 34:18.500
...our winnings.

34:18.566 --> 34:19.800
Part?

34:21.033 --> 34:23.633
A substantial part.

34:23.700 --> 34:24.800
It doesn't prove anything.

34:24.866 --> 34:26.200
I mean, Tom just said
this morning

34:26.266 --> 34:27.933
that he wanted to start
saving money.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.400
Is your name on that account?

34:32.166 --> 34:33.533
It is now.

34:35.066 --> 34:38.233
Tom must have forgot.
They said that he was rushed.

34:38.300 --> 34:40.166
Do I stay?

34:40.233 --> 34:41.800
Why? So that
the 25 years from now

34:41.866 --> 34:44.233
I don't turn into you,
and come looking for me.

34:44.300 --> 34:47.866
I know it seems crazy,
but you have to listen.

34:47.933 --> 34:51.033
Let me stay and I can show you
where things went wrong.

34:51.100 --> 34:52.633
We can correct them.

34:52.700 --> 34:54.366
Tom will be home any minute.

34:54.433 --> 34:57.033
Let me stay at-at least
through dinner.

34:57.100 --> 34:58.766
'I have to see
the two of you together.'

34:58.833 --> 35:03.066
I have to remember
what it was like to be in love.

35:03.133 --> 35:05.266
And see where the seeds
were planted.

35:05.333 --> 35:06.633
Please.

35:07.733 --> 35:08.733
He's here.

35:10.266 --> 35:11.500
Please.

35:14.433 --> 35:15.600
Alright.

35:17.433 --> 35:20.100
I'll, uh, get dinner ready

35:21.666 --> 35:24.200
- His favorite's beef stew.
- His favorite's beef stew.

35:34.766 --> 35:36.833
How was your day?

35:36.900 --> 35:38.933
Um, pretty dull.

35:40.666 --> 35:43.033
- How was yours?
- Not bad. Not bad at all.

35:43.100 --> 35:44.233
Really?

35:44.300 --> 35:46.066
What did you do?

35:46.133 --> 35:48.800
I was gonna tell you
during dinner.

35:48.866 --> 35:51.533
But what the hell?
Now, don't be mad.

35:51.600 --> 35:54.333
- I opened an account today.
- You did?

35:54.400 --> 35:56.333
Yeah, with a large part
of our winnings.

35:56.400 --> 35:57.700
At first,
I kept your name off it.

35:57.766 --> 36:00.000
I was afraid you'd spend
it all on talking appliances.

36:01.333 --> 36:04.200
Then I figured,
who am I to decide?

36:04.266 --> 36:05.833
I'll make it a joint account
in the morning.

36:05.900 --> 36:07.300
Oh, Tom.

36:42.100 --> 36:44.066
You see?

36:44.133 --> 36:46.333
Tom and I love
each other very much.

36:47.166 --> 36:49.100
You must have been wrong.

36:49.166 --> 36:51.333
I watched him,
I saw nothing.

36:51.400 --> 36:54.333
No hint to what might
go wrong later.

36:55.833 --> 36:58.000
I've forgotten
how charming he could be.

36:58.066 --> 36:59.733
And will be.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.200
No, it..

37:01.266 --> 37:03.966
...it goes wrong somewhere

37:04.033 --> 37:07.333
Maybe, it's us. Maybe we did
something to start it.

37:07.400 --> 37:09.333
Well, did you notice anything?

37:11.633 --> 37:14.366
Uh, just let him feel
that he's taking care of you.

37:14.433 --> 37:17.233
Let him feel that...
that you need him.

37:17.300 --> 37:18.766
I do.

37:18.833 --> 37:20.200
'Honey, I'm heading upstairs.'

37:20.266 --> 37:22.200
I'll be right up, Tom.

37:25.666 --> 37:26.933
You're leaving?

37:27.000 --> 37:29.300
'It's in your hands now.'

37:29.366 --> 37:33.300
Remember, not to let him come
to feel that he's unnecessary.

37:33.366 --> 37:34.366
Don't let him believe that.

37:34.433 --> 37:36.833
I know that he doesn't.

37:36.900 --> 37:39.700
And you'll tell him
"I love you?"

37:39.766 --> 37:40.966
Of course.

37:41.033 --> 37:43.133
Every day, every hour
is important.

37:43.200 --> 37:44.200
I know.

37:45.866 --> 37:47.966
Please, promise me that

37:48.033 --> 37:49.166
you'll give it back, the money.

37:49.233 --> 37:51.033
It has to go back to..

37:51.100 --> 37:52.566
...to some charity maybe.

37:52.633 --> 37:55.233
Don't you understand?
It's not the money.

37:55.300 --> 37:57.600
It's the way
we treat each other.

37:57.666 --> 38:00.333
Rich or poor,
we're the same people.

38:00.400 --> 38:02.533
Things will change.

38:02.600 --> 38:06.233
Some money is a,
a cheat, a witch.

38:06.300 --> 38:10.000
Please. Get it out of our lives.

38:10.066 --> 38:11.033
Alright.

38:14.433 --> 38:16.400
I'll get rid of it.

38:17.800 --> 38:19.733
Then there's hope for us.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.433
There's more than hope.

38:22.500 --> 38:25.800
I'll make sure that
I never become...you.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.933
Good. You stick to that.

38:30.933 --> 38:33.433
Then I have helped.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.566
- 'Judy?'
- Yeah.

39:47.633 --> 39:49.600
The maid service just called.

39:50.466 --> 39:52.000
And?

39:52.066 --> 39:53.100
Th-they said they were sorry

39:53.166 --> 39:55.133
they couldn't
send anyone out today.

39:56.333 --> 39:58.300
Who was here today?

40:14.533 --> 40:15.833
Tom?

40:16.700 --> 40:18.000
Yeah, honey?

40:19.466 --> 40:22.066
What if I said I wanted to give
all the money away?

40:22.133 --> 40:23.500
Hm, what?

40:24.866 --> 40:26.933
The prize winnings.
What if..

40:27.000 --> 40:28.666
What if I thought
it complicated our lives

40:28.733 --> 40:31.833
and I wanted to give it
all away, to charity?

40:31.900 --> 40:33.166
Don't be silly.

40:33.233 --> 40:35.066
It's ours to keep.

40:35.133 --> 40:36.700
You don't have
to feel guilty, honey.

40:36.766 --> 40:38.533
It's not guilt..

40:39.733 --> 40:42.233
We don't need it to be happy.

40:42.300 --> 40:43.466
No.

40:43.533 --> 40:45.500
We don't have to return it
to be happy, either.

40:47.033 --> 40:49.100
Get some sleep.

40:49.166 --> 40:50.600
Stop thinking.

40:50.666 --> 40:52.600
Hm? That's my job.

41:10.366 --> 41:11.766
"My job."

42:07.066 --> 42:08.700
'No, no, no.
I'll call you later.'

42:08.766 --> 42:10.733
'I can't talk right now.'

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
'Don't forget, I have
a little surprise for you.'

42:19.066 --> 42:21.200
'Are you sure
she won't find out?'

42:21.266 --> 42:22.900
'No, she won't be a problem.'

42:22.966 --> 42:24.266
'Look, I gotta go.'

42:24.333 --> 42:26.166
'I miss you.'

42:26.233 --> 42:27.600
'Yeah. Me, too.'

42:36.233 --> 42:38.766
It's in your hands now.

42:38.833 --> 42:41.066
You promised to love me,
and then you forgot who I am.

42:41.133 --> 42:43.400
And then you'll discover
his plot to remove you.

42:43.466 --> 42:45.100
Wish I'd never met her.

42:45.166 --> 42:47.066
Don't forget, I have

42:45.166 --> 42:47.066
a little surprise for you.

42:47.133 --> 42:49.266
Are you sure

42:47.133 --> 42:49.266
she won't find out?

42:49.333 --> 42:51.200
No, she won't be a problem.

42:51.266 --> 42:54.633
He will take a mistress.

42:54.700 --> 42:56.800
And she will want it all.

42:56.866 --> 42:59.366
- You killed him?
- We did.

42:59.433 --> 43:03.200
- You killed him?
- We did.

43:04.600 --> 43:06.633
It's in your hands now.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.933
And you'll tell him,
"I love you?"

43:16.000 --> 43:17.500
Of course.

43:17.566 --> 43:20.800
Every day, every hour

43:17.566 --> 43:20.800
is important.

43:33.733 --> 43:35.700
It's in your hands now.

43:54.966 --> 43:56.100
Tom.

43:56.766 --> 43:57.933
Yeah.

43:59.966 --> 44:01.400
I love you.

44:02.533 --> 44:04.033
I know, honey.

44:05.500 --> 44:07.433
Can I have my coffee?

44:15.700 --> 44:17.633
Honey, please,
I don't have much time.

44:18.133 --> 44:19.533
I know.

44:37.266 --> 44:39.166
Aw..

44:39.233 --> 44:42.400
Love is a very
splendid thing.
