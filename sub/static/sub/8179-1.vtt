HONEY, I AM
SO PROUD OF YOU

01:14.990 --> 01:16.925

01:16.992 --> 01:20.111

NO BOOBIES.

01:21.881 --> 01:23.898
OK, STILL SOME BOOBIES.

01:23.966 --> 01:27.001
BUT MUCH SMALLER ONES.
BOOBLETTES.

01:27.069 --> 01:28.069
LOOK AT THIS.

01:28.136 --> 01:29.336
I AM HUGGING YOU,

01:48.023 --> 01:49.373

01:49.441 --> 01:51.692
WELL, BECAUSE THOSE
ARE ACID-WASHED JEANS,

01:51.760 --> 01:55.863
AND IT'S 2003 OUT THERE.

01:55.931 --> 01:57.849

JUST TELL ME.
HERSHEY PARK?

02:07.543 --> 02:08.476
HERSHEY PARK? NO.

02:08.543 --> 02:10.828
THIS IS A TRIP TO CELEBRATE MY THINNESS.

02:10.895 --> 02:14.316
SO, WHERE ARE WE GOING-
SALAD WORLD?

02:17.153 --> 02:18.153
YOU'RE JUST GONNA

A SPACE SUIT? HMM.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.577

02:35.654 --> 02:37.455
LOOKING AT YOU

02:37.523 --> 02:42.127
WITH YOUR BUZZ-CUT HAIR
AND YOUR CHISELED BUTTOCKS,

02:42.194 --> 02:45.931
ONE MIGHT MISTAKE YOU
FOR A VOLUPTUOUS LADY TRUCKER.

02:49.234 --> 02:50.735
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'VE
BEEN TALKING ABOUT MY BUTTOCKS

02:50.803 --> 02:52.470
FOR 5 DAYS NOW.

02:52.537 --> 02:55.907
EITHER MAKE YOUR MOVE
OR WALK AWAY.

02:56.792 --> 02:58.043
COME IN!

02:58.110 --> 02:59.411
HEY, GUY. ARTHUR.

02:59.478 --> 03:00.412

03:00.479 --> 03:03.114
WOW, ACID-WASHED JEANS.

03:03.182 --> 03:06.301

A R.E.O. SPEEDWAGON CONCERT?

03:06.368 --> 03:07.485
I GOT NEWS FOR YOU.

03:07.552 --> 03:09.020

03:09.088 --> 03:09.921
SPERO WANTS TO KNOW

03:09.989 --> 03:11.506

03:11.574 --> 03:14.342
I CAN'T, MAN. CARRIE'S TAKING ME
SHOPPING FOR VACATION CLOTHES.

03:14.410 --> 03:16.411
OH, YOUR TRIP. RIGHT.
WHERE YOU GOING?

03:16.478 --> 03:18.279
WE'RE GOING TO THIS AWESOME
LODGE UP IN THE MOUNTAINS.

03:18.347 --> 03:21.249
I TOOK HER THERE 10 YEARS AGO.
WE HAD A GREAT TIME.

03:21.316 --> 03:24.052
SHE GAVE ME THIS MASSAGE
WITH THESE OILS.

03:24.119 --> 03:27.922
Deac... she was basting
me like a turkey.

03:29.508 --> 03:32.527
OK, ALL I ASKED WAS
WHERE YOU WERE GOING.

03:34.863 --> 03:38.199
UH, LISTEN, ARTHUR. IF THE HOTEL
CALLS ABOUT THE RESERVATION,

03:38.267 --> 03:40.535
JUST WRITE DOWN
THE CONFIRMATION NUMBER,

03:40.602 --> 03:41.869
BUT DON'T
TELL CARRIE, OK?

03:41.937 --> 03:43.071
IT'S A SURPRISE,
ALL RIGHT?

03:43.138 --> 03:44.872
AND PUT IT IN MY TOP DRAWER. YOU GOT IT?

03:44.940 --> 03:46.507
I DIDN'T HEAR
A WORD YOU SAID,

03:46.575 --> 03:49.677
YOU SLINKY
SON OF A BITCH.

03:54.867 --> 03:56.667
NUMBER 3

03:56.735 --> 03:58.036
HERE'S YOUR KEY, AND I'LL
GO GRAB YOU THAT SWEATER.

03:58.103 --> 03:59.670
THANK YOU.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.196
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:09.264 --> 04:10.698
WHAT?

04:10.766 --> 04:12.166
YOU CAN'T COME
IN THE DRESSING ROOM WITH ME.

04:12.234 --> 04:13.701
WHY NOT?

04:13.769 --> 04:15.754
I DON'T KNOW. PEOPLE'LL
THINK WE'RE DOING SOMETHING.

04:16.904 --> 04:17.988
ARE WE?

04:18.055 --> 04:19.740

04:23.729 --> 04:25.146
YEAH? HEY, ARE YOU

04:25.213 --> 04:27.165
COMPUTER TRAINING THING

04:27.233 --> 04:28.299
NO. I GOT OUT OF IT,

04:28.366 --> 04:30.367
TOLD THEM I HAD A DENTIST APPOINTMENT.

04:30.435 --> 04:32.053
FUNERAL!

04:32.121 --> 04:34.239
HEY, AMY.

04:34.306 --> 04:36.524
OH, MY GOD. DOUG.

04:36.591 --> 04:39.093
LOOK AT YOU!

04:39.161 --> 04:39.844
DOESN'T HE?

04:39.912 --> 04:41.028
HOW'D YOU DO IT?

04:41.096 --> 04:42.696
I JUST
CUT OUT CARBS.

04:42.764 --> 04:46.350
I WISH I'D KNOWN THERE WAS AN
ALL-BACON DIET 10 YEARS AGO.

04:46.418 --> 04:49.487
TURNS OUT I WAS KNOCKING
ON THE DOOR THE WHOLE TIME.

04:49.555 --> 04:51.672
ALL RIGHT, LET'S
CHECK YOU OUT HERE.

04:51.740 --> 04:53.058
HOW MUCH
DID YOU LOSE?

04:53.125 --> 04:54.408
LIKE 40 POUNDS.

04:54.476 --> 04:56.327
YOU ARE MY HERO.

04:56.395 --> 04:58.879
YOUR POLICE OFFICERS, YOUR
FIREFIGHTERS, THEY'RE YOUR HEROES.

04:58.948 --> 05:00.648
I JUST LOOK FANTASTIC.

05:02.384 --> 05:03.868

WELL, IF YOU LIKE THESE-

05:04.019 --> 05:06.654
ALTHOUGH, I GUESS, YOU KNOW

05:06.722 --> 05:08.656
HERE'S THAT SWEATER
YOU WANTED. OH, THANKS

05:08.724 --> 05:10.825
THIS GUY JUST
LOST 40 POUNDS.

05:10.892 --> 05:12.660
WOW! REALLY?

05:12.728 --> 05:14.629
I WOULD NEVER PEG YOU
AS AN OVERWEIGHT GUY.

05:14.697 --> 05:16.431
I MEAN, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU
PLAY FOOTBALL OR SOMETHING.

05:16.498 --> 05:18.666
I DID USED TO.
AND I WATCH A LOT.

05:18.734 --> 05:19.900
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:19.968 --> 05:21.736
I THINK HE'S GONNA NEED
THESE IN A BIGGER SIZE.

05:21.803 --> 05:23.070
NO, NO, NO. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SNUG.

05:23.138 --> 05:24.539
AND LOOK HOW CUTE
THEY ARE ON HIM.

05:24.606 --> 05:25.640
HE LOOKS
ADORABLE.

05:25.708 --> 05:26.908
DOESN'T HE?

05:35.617 --> 05:38.386
DOUG, YOU WORKING OUT,
MAN? YOU LOOK RIPPED.

05:38.453 --> 05:40.722
THAT'S FUNNY.
USUALLY YOU HIT ON HER.

05:40.789 --> 05:42.990
HA HA HA!

05:44.926 --> 05:47.328
LOOKING GOOD,
MR. HEFFERNAN.

05:52.884 --> 05:55.987
WELL, YOUR BAD CHOLESTEROL IS
DOWN, GOOD CHOLESTEROL IS UP.

05:56.055 --> 05:58.222
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE'S
UNDER CONTROL.

05:58.290 --> 06:01.092
AND YOUR BODY MASS INDEX
IS NEARING THE NORMAL RANGE.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.360
YOU KEEP THIS UP,

06:02.428 --> 06:05.663
YOU'RE GONNA ADD ANOTHER
20 YEARS ON TO YOUR LIFE.

06:17.226 --> 06:18.560
HEY, GUYS.

06:18.627 --> 06:20.261
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
OUT WALKING MY DAD.

06:20.328 --> 06:22.196
OH, I WAS, BUT HE CAME
BACK HERE TO CHANGE.

06:22.264 --> 06:25.566
HE WORE SOCKS WITH
SANDALS TO THE PARK, AND...

06:25.634 --> 06:27.935
WELL, SOME OF THE KIDS
GOT PRETTY CRUEL.

06:28.002 --> 06:28.752
OK.

06:28.904 --> 06:29.837
ALL RIGHT, HON,
I'M GOING UPSTAIRS,

06:29.905 --> 06:30.938
GONNA THROW
THE G-STRING ON

06:31.006 --> 06:32.740
AND SEE WHAT
THE HYPE'S ABOUT.

06:35.878 --> 06:37.545
DOUG LOOKS
REALLY GREAT.

06:37.613 --> 06:39.813
YEAH. HE DROPPED
A FEW POUNDS.

06:39.881 --> 06:40.948
I BET HE DID.
I'VE BEEN TRYING

06:41.015 --> 06:43.718
TO GET RID OF TURNER AND
HOOCH HERE FOR QUITE A WHILE,

06:43.785 --> 06:45.486
BUT ALL IT TAKES
IS ONE KEGGER,

06:45.554 --> 06:48.256
AND BOOM, LOOK WHO'S
WEARING OVERALLS.

06:48.323 --> 06:49.423
RIGHT.

06:49.491 --> 06:50.175
YEAH. BUT HE
REALLY LOOKS GOOD.

06:50.242 --> 06:51.259
YEAH,
YOU MENTIONED IT.

06:51.326 --> 06:52.493
NO, BUT IT'S-
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:52.560 --> 06:53.994
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY EVERYBODY

06:54.062 --> 06:55.329
WANTS TO THROW HIM
A PARADE.

06:55.397 --> 06:58.165
I MEAN, HE'S NOT THE FIRST
PERSON TO DROP A FEW POUNDS.

06:58.233 --> 06:59.434
WHAT ABOUT OPRAH?

06:59.501 --> 07:02.169
ALL OF A SUDDEN, SHE'S
WHAT, YESTERDAY'S NEWS?

07:03.121 --> 07:04.905
NO. I THINK ABOUT OPRAH
ALL THE TIME.

07:04.973 --> 07:06.757
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

07:06.825 --> 07:09.043
WHY DOES EVERYBODY MAKE
SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT?

07:09.111 --> 07:10.177
WELL, IT'S JUST
THAT PEOPLE ARE

07:10.245 --> 07:11.512
USED TO SEEING YOU
TOGETHER, YOU KNOW?

07:11.580 --> 07:12.981
AND YOU'RE SO GORGEOUS,

07:13.048 --> 07:14.248
IT WAS LIKE
YOU WERE UP HERE,

07:14.316 --> 07:15.282
AND HE WAS KINDA,
LIKE, DOWN HERE.

07:15.350 --> 07:18.002
BUT NOW
IT'S LIKE... EH?

07:18.070 --> 07:20.404
EH-EH-EH.

07:20.472 --> 07:24.475
I MEAN, YOU'RE
PRACTICALLY EQUALS.

07:25.594 --> 07:27.361
YEAH.

07:27.429 --> 07:29.863
OK, PUT YOUR HANDS DOWN
BEFORE I SMACK 'EM DOWN.

07:34.202 --> 07:36.537
DOUG, BREAKFAST!

07:36.605 --> 07:41.325
WHERE ARE WE HEADED? IS IT IN
AMERICA OR IN A FOREIGN LAND?

07:41.393 --> 07:45.129
OR IN A FOREIGN LAND
IN AMERICA, LIKE EPCOT.

07:46.348 --> 07:49.250
WELL, WHEREVER IT IS,
SIT DOWN AND EAT

07:49.317 --> 07:53.287
YOUR SPECIAL
GOING-ON-VACATION PANCAKES.

07:55.457 --> 07:57.925
CARRIE, YOU KNOW I CAN'T HAVE
PANCAKES. THEY'RE FULL OF CARBS.

07:57.993 --> 08:00.844
ARE THEY?

08:00.912 --> 08:02.213
YEAH.

08:02.281 --> 08:04.082
I THINK
YOU'RE WRONG.

08:04.149 --> 08:04.815
I'LL TAKE 'EM.

08:04.883 --> 08:05.933
DAD, THESE
ARE FOR DOUG.

08:06.001 --> 08:07.635
I TOLD YOU, I CAN'T
EAT THEM, ALL RIGHT?

08:07.703 --> 08:10.104
I'M TRYING TO EAT HEALTHY
AND STAY IN SHAPE.

08:10.172 --> 08:12.740
EATING DISORDER.

08:12.808 --> 08:15.276
I SAID I'D TAKE THEM.
I'M STARVING.

08:15.343 --> 08:18.595
YOU'VE ALREADY HAD 3
BOWLS OF CREAM OF WHEAT.

08:18.663 --> 08:19.897
BECAUSE I'M STARVING.

08:19.965 --> 08:22.333
THANK YOU FOR MAKING MY
POINT AND FOR EMBARRASSING ME.

08:25.253 --> 08:27.054
HEY.
HEY, GUYS.

08:27.122 --> 08:30.608
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
STAYING HERE WHILE WE'RE AWAY.

08:30.675 --> 08:31.526
OH, NO, IT'S NO PROBLEM.
IT WORKED OUT, ACTUALLY.

08:31.593 --> 08:34.578
TURNS OUT OUR PLACE
IS BEING FLEA-BOMBED.

08:34.645 --> 08:37.347
OK, SO, ANYTHING WE NEED
TO KNOW BEFORE YOU LEAVE?

08:37.416 --> 08:39.549
UM, YEAH. JUST DO ME A
FAVOR AND DON'T USE MY SOAP.

08:39.618 --> 08:42.804
THAT SKEEVES ME, OK?

08:42.871 --> 08:44.772
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL
JUST WORRY THAT YOU DID USE IT,

08:44.840 --> 08:48.543
SO DO WHAT YOU WANT. I'M JUST
GONNA THROW IT AWAY ANYWAY.

08:48.610 --> 08:49.977
ALL RIGHT.
AND ONE MORE THING.

08:50.045 --> 08:53.080
HERE'S A LIST OF APPLIANCES
MY DAD CAN'T USE.

08:53.148 --> 08:57.551
OK. "DISHWASHER,
OVEN, CAN OPENER."

08:57.619 --> 09:00.087
HOW'D HE GET IN TROUBLE WITH A WHISK?

09:00.155 --> 09:01.755
HE RUNS WITH IT.

09:01.823 --> 09:03.657
IT'S A WHOLE THING.

09:03.725 --> 09:06.460
NOW, LISTEN. DO NOT LET
MY DAD DRIVE THE CAR.

09:06.528 --> 09:08.396
HE'LL SAY THAT HE'S
ALLOWED TO, BUT HE'S NOT.

09:08.463 --> 09:09.697
ALL RIGHT, THE HEFFERNAN
TRAIN IS LEAVING.

09:09.765 --> 09:12.366
BUT WHERE
IS IT GOING? HMM?

09:12.434 --> 09:13.734
YOU HAVE TO STOP
DOING THAT.

09:13.802 --> 09:14.902
OK, I WILL.
OR WILL I?

09:14.970 --> 09:16.453
DOUG!

09:36.525 --> 09:38.526
CAN I TAKE
THIS THING OFF NOW?

09:38.593 --> 09:39.593
NO. YOU'LL RUIN
THE SURPRISE.

09:39.661 --> 09:43.247
DOUG, I'VE BEEN WEARING
THIS THING FOR 4 HOURS.

09:43.315 --> 09:45.149
YEAH, IT'S CALLED
BUILDING THE ANTICIPATION.

09:45.217 --> 09:47.485
LIKE SEX.

09:47.553 --> 09:51.271
YEAH, DOUG. 'CAUSE WHEN WE HAVE
SEX, IT ALWAYS LASTS FOR 4 HOURS.

09:51.339 --> 09:53.624
HA HA HA!
I GET IT.

09:53.692 --> 09:55.326
'CAUSE IT DOESN'T.

09:55.394 --> 09:57.495
YOU KEEP ME YOUNG,
CARRIE.

10:03.551 --> 10:06.170
ALL RIGHT, NOW, WE'RE
PULLING INTO A GAS STATION.

10:06.238 --> 10:07.605
BUT DON'T WORRY.

10:07.673 --> 10:10.491
THIS IS NOT WHERE WE'RE
SPENDING OUR WEEKEND.

10:10.558 --> 10:12.743
OR IS IT?

10:12.811 --> 10:15.112
HA HA HA!

10:19.567 --> 10:21.169
HEY, GUY.
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

10:21.236 --> 10:23.037
IT'S GOIN'.

10:23.105 --> 10:25.372
GREAT. COULD YOU FILL
IT UP? SUPER UNLEADED?

10:25.524 --> 10:28.359
OK.

10:39.688 --> 10:41.172
HERE YA GO.

10:41.239 --> 10:43.241
HEY, QUESTION FOR YA.

10:44.509 --> 10:46.544
I'M TAKING HER
UP TO THE LAKE.

10:46.612 --> 10:50.047
I WANNA KNOW IF THIS
IS THE BEST ROUTE.

10:50.115 --> 10:51.999
THE ONLY REASON
I'M WHISPERING IS BECAUSE

10:52.067 --> 10:54.735
I DON'T WANT HER TO KNOW
WHERE SHE'S GOING.

10:56.621 --> 10:58.055
IS SHE OK?

10:58.123 --> 10:59.623
OH, YEAH.
SHE'S FINE.

10:59.691 --> 11:01.525
LEAVE IT ON.

11:03.011 --> 11:05.979
SO SHOULD I TAKE
THE 414 OR THE 28?

11:06.047 --> 11:07.714
414's BETTER.

11:07.782 --> 11:09.116
AW, THANKS, GUY.
THERE YOU GO.

11:30.305 --> 11:32.039
OH. AHEM.

11:33.324 --> 11:34.458
WHAT?

11:34.525 --> 11:36.076
WELL, WE HAVEN'T
REALLY DISCUSSED

11:36.144 --> 11:38.111
WHO'D BE
GETTING THE BED.

11:39.214 --> 11:42.216
OK. THEN LET'S,
UH, DISCUSS IT NOW.

11:42.284 --> 11:44.918
I'M GETTIN' IT.

11:44.986 --> 11:47.922
JUST LIKE THAT,
YOU GET IT?

11:47.989 --> 11:50.691
A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD
CALL THAT PRESUMPTUOUS.

11:50.759 --> 11:52.359
WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE
ALSO SLEEP IN A BED,

11:52.427 --> 11:54.228
BUT YOU AIN'T
ONE OF 'EM.

11:57.666 --> 11:59.583
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GETTING IN!

11:59.651 --> 12:00.951
FINE, BRING IT.

12:01.019 --> 12:01.886
I WILL.

12:01.954 --> 12:04.304
WELL, GOOD.
WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?

12:06.942 --> 12:08.459
IF YOU THINK
I'M GONNA LET

12:08.494 --> 12:10.678
ONE UNCOMFORTABLE
CAMP EXPERIENCE

12:10.745 --> 12:11.912
KEEP ME
OUT OF THIS BED,

12:11.980 --> 12:13.346
YOU ARE WRONG.

12:13.414 --> 12:15.382
ALL RIGHT.
I'M GETTING IN,

12:15.450 --> 12:16.934
AND I'M NOT
GETTING OUT.

12:17.002 --> 12:18.736
GREAT.

12:25.076 --> 12:27.645
YOU STILL WANNA
STAY? BECAUSE...

12:27.712 --> 12:29.547
I SLEEP FREESTYLE.

12:34.018 --> 12:36.220
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:39.357 --> 12:41.892
SO DO I.

12:42.994 --> 12:46.463
OOH, THAT'S GOOD.
YEAH.

12:55.857 --> 12:59.126
WE MAY HAVE WANDERED
DOWN A BAD ROAD HERE.

13:02.781 --> 13:04.131
DOUGLAS, CARRIE.

13:04.198 --> 13:05.132
HEY, ARTHUR.

13:05.199 --> 13:06.717
HEY.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.302
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

13:08.370 --> 13:12.023
IT'S THE NE'ER-DO-WELL COUSIN
AND HIS FOPPISH ROOMMATE.

13:12.090 --> 13:13.024
WELCOME.

13:13.091 --> 13:14.692
THANKS.

13:14.760 --> 13:17.344
OH, THAT'S STRANGE.

13:17.411 --> 13:20.280
I CAN'T SEEM
TO FIND MY CAR KEYS.

13:20.348 --> 13:24.317
OH, WELL. I'LL JUST GRAB THE
EXTRA SET FROM THE COFFEE CAN.

13:24.385 --> 13:27.037
ARTHUR, DOUG AND CARRIE
SAID YOU COULDN'T DRIVE.

13:27.105 --> 13:29.206
WHAT? NO.
THEY'RE KIDDING.

13:29.274 --> 13:30.675
DIDN'T SOUND LIKE
THEY WERE KIDDING.

13:30.742 --> 13:33.393
THEIR HUMOR IS SUBTLE
LIKE JACK PAAR'S.

13:33.461 --> 13:34.795
ARTHUR,
THE ANSWER'S NO.

13:34.863 --> 13:36.197
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

13:36.264 --> 13:38.632
I'M TRYING TO IMPRESS BRENDA
SICKLICK DOWN AT THE SENIOR CENTER.

13:38.700 --> 13:41.001
IF I DON'T HAVE WHEELS,
I DON'T HAVE A CHANCE.

13:41.069 --> 13:42.686
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

13:43.988 --> 13:45.873
DANIEL, I APPEAL TO YOU

13:45.941 --> 13:49.176
AS THE, ARGUABLY,
MANLIER OF THE TWO.

13:49.244 --> 13:51.212
PLEASE.

13:51.279 --> 13:52.713
IT'S JUST DOWN
TO THE SENIOR CENTER.

13:52.781 --> 13:54.014
IS IT REALLY
THAT BIG A DEAL?

13:54.081 --> 13:54.748
YES, IT IS
THAT BIG A DEAL.

13:54.816 --> 13:56.801
CARRIE AND DOUG SPECIFICALLY SAID NO.

13:56.868 --> 13:57.802
WHAT IF IT'S
AN EMERGENCY?

13:57.869 --> 13:59.169
NO.
I DON'T KNOW.

13:59.237 --> 14:01.806
HE COULD PROBABLY DRIVE
IF IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

14:01.873 --> 14:04.041
HE CAN'T DRIVE IF IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

14:04.109 --> 14:06.343
FINE. SHOULD YOU
START BLEEDING PROFUSELY,

14:06.411 --> 14:09.880
I'LL JUST SIT AND STARE
AT YOU, AS PER YOUR WISHES.

14:09.948 --> 14:12.716
IT'S FINE. YOU CAN DRIVE
IF IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

14:12.784 --> 14:13.667
SWEET.

14:13.818 --> 14:15.018
AS A TOKEN
OF MY THANKS,

14:15.086 --> 14:17.454
I SHOULD LIKE TO MAKE YOU
FINE GENTLEMEN SOME EGGS.

14:19.558 --> 14:21.792
COULD YOU POINT ME
TOWARD THE WHISK?

14:31.720 --> 14:33.771
SO, DID I DO GOOD?
WERE YOU SURPRISED?

14:33.839 --> 14:36.641
YEAH. SO SURPRISED.

14:36.708 --> 14:39.076
IT'S BEAUTIFUL HERE.

14:39.144 --> 14:41.112
I'M SO GLAD
WE'RE FINALLY HERE.

14:41.179 --> 14:42.346
ME, TOO.

14:42.413 --> 14:44.548
CAN YOU BELIEVE I GOT US THE SAME ROOM?

14:44.616 --> 14:46.016
HMM?

14:46.083 --> 14:48.452
I GOT US THE SAME ROOM AS LAST TIME.

14:51.856 --> 14:54.391
WHAT LAST TIME?

14:56.060 --> 14:57.628
LAST TIME
WE WERE HERE.

15:00.982 --> 15:02.416
WE WERE NEVER HERE.

15:02.483 --> 15:04.451
COME ON, STOP IT.

15:06.421 --> 15:08.321
STOP WHAT?
WE WERE NEVER HERE.

15:08.473 --> 15:11.408
YES, WE WERE. WE WERE
HERE, LIKE, 10 YEARS AGO.

15:11.476 --> 15:13.277
REMEMBER? WE BECAME BEST FRIENDS

15:13.345 --> 15:15.812
WITH JESSE
THE ROOM SERVICE GUY

15:15.880 --> 15:18.499
'CAUSE WE DIDN'T LEAVE THE
ROOM THE ENTIRE WEEKEND.

15:24.422 --> 15:25.956
NO.

15:29.093 --> 15:31.395
I SAID I COULD
STAY HERE FOREVER

15:31.462 --> 15:33.163
BECAUSE I DON'T NEED
ANYTHING IN THE WORLD

15:33.231 --> 15:36.700
EXCEPT YOU AND FOOD
ROLLED IN ON A CART.

15:38.719 --> 15:40.971
AND YOU LAUGHED.

15:44.259 --> 15:45.659
NO.

15:49.480 --> 15:52.049
WE SAW A RACCOON AND
NAMED IT M.C. HAMMER

15:52.117 --> 15:54.484
'CAUSE IT HAD
EXTRA-FURRY LEGS.

15:56.454 --> 15:59.106
LIKE HAMMER PANTS.

15:59.874 --> 16:01.391
NO.

16:05.329 --> 16:07.831
YOU GAVE ME
A SPECIAL MASSAGE.

16:10.168 --> 16:12.836
WITH THE HERBAL OILS
IN THE BATHROOM.

16:16.157 --> 16:18.591
DOUG...

16:18.659 --> 16:21.245
I WAS NEVER HERE.

16:23.464 --> 16:25.165
OH.

16:30.171 --> 16:32.105
I THINK I WAS HERE
ALONE. THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.

16:32.257 --> 16:35.726
OH, MY GOD!
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU!

16:35.794 --> 16:37.128
YOU WERE HERE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE!

16:37.195 --> 16:38.495
NO! NO! IT WAS
DEFINITELY YOU!

16:38.563 --> 16:39.630
I DISTINCTLY
REMEMBER,

16:39.697 --> 16:40.831
'CAUSE IT WAS THE LAST TIME I WAS THIN!

16:40.898 --> 16:41.866
YOU WERE NEVER
THIN WITH ME!

16:41.933 --> 16:43.067
YES, I WAS!

16:43.135 --> 16:45.319
DOUG, I THINK I'D REMEMBER
IF YOU WERE THIN, OK?

16:45.387 --> 16:47.020
I WOULD REMEMBER
EVERYBODY COMING UP TO YOU,

16:47.088 --> 16:49.390
GOING, "OH, MY GOD! YOU LOOK
SO GREAT! YOU LOOK SO FANTASTIC!

16:49.457 --> 16:51.559
YOU'RE THE SKINNIEST MAN
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD!"

16:51.626 --> 16:53.494
NEVER HAPPENED!

16:55.413 --> 16:57.064
GET THE DOOR.

16:59.200 --> 17:00.133
ROOM SERVICE.

17:00.201 --> 17:01.434
HEY, GREAT.
THANK YOU.

17:01.502 --> 17:03.303
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.

17:04.505 --> 17:05.605
DOUG?

17:08.358 --> 17:10.594
JESSE.

17:10.662 --> 17:12.930
HOW YOU DOIN', MAN?

17:12.998 --> 17:13.997
GOOD. GOOD. YOU?

17:14.065 --> 17:14.814
PRETTY GOOD.
PRETTY GOOD.

17:14.965 --> 17:16.633
YOU KNOW, STILL DOING
THE ROOM SERVICE THING.

17:16.701 --> 17:17.401
GREAT. THAT'S GREAT.

17:17.469 --> 17:18.752
IS BETH HERE
WITH YOU?

17:18.819 --> 17:21.387
OH, MY GOD.

17:21.454 --> 17:23.858
RIGHT.
BETH McGURTRIE.

17:23.925 --> 17:25.659
THAT MAKES
A LOT OF SENSE.

17:25.727 --> 17:27.044
YEAH.
NO, HI, JESSE.

17:27.112 --> 17:29.246
BETH HASN'T BEEN WITH HIM FOR 10 YEARS.

17:29.313 --> 17:31.314
CARRIE
HEFFERNAN. HI.

17:31.382 --> 17:33.667
OH, MAN.
I'M SORRY.

17:34.802 --> 17:36.036
DOUG, WE'LL
CATCH UP LATER.

17:36.104 --> 17:38.272
YEAH.

17:42.743 --> 17:43.677
THAT WAS JESSE.

17:43.744 --> 17:45.179
YEAH, GOT THAT.

17:45.246 --> 17:46.913
SO, YOU, UH-
YOU HUNGRY?

17:46.981 --> 17:48.198
NO, I'M NOT
HUNGRY, DOUG.

17:48.265 --> 17:50.701
I'M DEVASTATED.

17:50.768 --> 17:51.769
LET'S JUST-
LET'S GO HOME.

17:51.836 --> 17:53.637
NO, COME ON.
LOOK, I'M SORRY, OK?

17:53.705 --> 17:55.105
I SCREWED UP, BUT...

17:55.173 --> 17:56.439
I OBVIOUSLY REMEMBERED IT AS BEING YOU

17:56.507 --> 17:58.475
BECAUSE I HAD
SUCH AN AMAZING TIME.

17:58.543 --> 18:02.463
AMAZINGLY WEIRD TIME.

18:02.530 --> 18:04.698
THE KIND OF TIME YOU WISH
YOU COULD DO OVER AGAIN

18:04.850 --> 18:07.218
WITH SOMEONE
YOU REALLY LOVE.

18:07.285 --> 18:10.420
AND NOW GOD HAS
GIVEN US THAT CHANCE.

18:13.141 --> 18:14.158
COME HERE.

18:14.226 --> 18:16.076
NO. GET OFF.

18:16.144 --> 18:17.962
COME ON. LET'S JUST STAY, ALL RIGHT?

18:18.029 --> 18:19.396
WE GOT THE MOUNTAINS.
WE GOT THE LAKE.

18:19.464 --> 18:23.183
WE GOT A BEAUTIFUL,
ROMANTIC, NONREFUNDABLE ROOM.

18:23.250 --> 18:27.220
YEAH, THE SAME ROOM YOU WERE
IN WITH SLUTTY McRUBDOWN.

18:28.489 --> 18:30.040
COME ON,
CAN'T WE JUST STAY

18:30.108 --> 18:32.643
AND ENJOY OURSELVES?
I LOVE YOU.

18:33.628 --> 18:34.761
FINE.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.222
AH. WELL, I SEE YOU TWO
BROKE IN THE BED.

18:52.564 --> 18:55.165
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LIKE THIS ROOM BETTER.

19:01.289 --> 19:02.856
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY
OUT THERE.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.959
HAVE YOU GUYS
CANOED HERE BEFORE?

19:05.026 --> 19:05.960
YEAH, ONCE.

19:06.027 --> 19:08.228
BUT I HATED IT.

19:08.296 --> 19:10.864
IT WAS, UH-IT WAS WITH
THE WRONG PERSON. YOU KNOW?

19:10.932 --> 19:14.067
THIS ONE, SHE'S THE ONE I WANNA
GO ROWING THROUGH LIFE WITH.

19:14.135 --> 19:15.902
HA HA HA!

19:15.970 --> 19:17.521
DO YOU HAVE
SOMEONE YOU LOVE?

19:17.589 --> 19:19.222
NO.
NO.

19:19.290 --> 19:22.392
I GUESS THERE'S NOT MUCH OF A
PERSONAL LIFE IN THE CANOE GAME, RIGHT?

19:22.460 --> 19:26.063
YOU'RE MARRIED TO LAKE
CHAPAWAWA. AM I RIGHT?

19:28.066 --> 19:29.199
ANYHOO.

19:29.266 --> 19:31.985
ALL RIGHT. WELL,
LET'S GET GOING HERE.

19:32.053 --> 19:34.120
HERE, HONEY.
THAT'S YOURS RIGHT THERE.

19:34.189 --> 19:37.857
ALL RIGHT.

19:37.925 --> 19:39.393
WHOA. WHOA.
IT'S THE PERFECT STORM.

19:39.460 --> 19:41.328
ALL RIGHT, DOUG.
PLEASE.

19:41.396 --> 19:42.329
OK.

19:42.397 --> 19:45.332
AH! THIS IS NICE.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.467
ROWING THE BOAT, HUH?

19:47.535 --> 19:48.468
HEY!

20:01.316 --> 20:02.382
EVERYBODY!

20:14.612 --> 20:16.647
THIS IS THE LIFE,
HUH, BABE?

20:16.714 --> 20:17.748
YEAH, I GUESS.

20:17.816 --> 20:21.051
WHOA! SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEBODY'S READY TO SING.

20:23.455 --> 20:25.722
ALL RIGHT, GOTTA SAVE
SOMETHING FOR THE ROW BACK.

20:28.460 --> 20:29.760
OH, GREAT IDEA.

20:29.828 --> 20:31.361
THERE'S THIS LITTLE
SECLUDED SPOT.

20:31.429 --> 20:34.464
VERY QUIET,
VERY ROMANTIC.

20:34.532 --> 20:36.166
WE SHOULD GO THERE.

20:36.234 --> 20:37.451
OH, REALLY?

20:37.518 --> 20:39.919
HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT SPOT, DOUG?

20:41.356 --> 20:43.490
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT SPOT SUCKS.

20:43.558 --> 20:45.626
WE'RE GONNA FIND
A BETTER SPOT.

20:45.693 --> 20:47.961
YOU KNOW WHAT? DOUG, I'M
SORRY I EVEN SAID ANYTHING.

20:48.028 --> 20:49.162
GO TO THE SPOT.

20:49.230 --> 20:50.947
NO! NO, NO, NO!
STOP IT.

20:51.015 --> 20:52.749
WE'RE NOT GONNA GO TO THE
SPOT. WE'LL FIND ANOTHER ONE.

20:52.817 --> 20:54.984
DOUG, I SAID GO TO THE SPOT! IT'S FINE!

20:55.052 --> 20:56.536
NO! STOP IT!

20:56.604 --> 20:57.604
OH,
THIS IS MATURE.

20:57.671 --> 20:58.605
STOP IT!

20:58.672 --> 21:00.073
THIS IS
VERY MATURE.

21:00.141 --> 21:02.109
STOP IT! STOP BEING MAD AT ME, OK?!

21:02.176 --> 21:04.078
I'M JUST OUT HERE, TRYING
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME WITH YOU!

21:04.145 --> 21:06.313
