WEBVTT

00:02.083 --> 00:03.833
What would you do in a hurricane?

00:04.083 --> 00:06.916
I would do what I always do. Protect you.

00:10.333 --> 00:11.500
I need a bow and arrow.

00:15.875 --> 00:17.250
Six days until Christmas.

00:17.333 --> 00:19.291
We'll fill it with a lot of activities.

00:19.375 --> 00:20.541
-Gingerbread house.
-Yes!

00:20.625 --> 00:22.041
Christmas movie marathon.

00:22.125 --> 00:24.416
It's gonna be the best
Barton Christmas ever.

00:24.500 --> 00:27.291
There have been a few changes
while you were away this semester.

00:27.375 --> 00:28.791
-Ta-da!
-KATE: Jack?

00:28.875 --> 00:32.166
Those secretive little lovebirds.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.791
Seems like he won the jackpot.

00:33.875 --> 00:35.333
I'm not so sure.

00:35.416 --> 00:38.666
-KATE: Is that guy threatening you?
-I... Honestly, I have no idea.

00:38.750 --> 00:40.458
Up next,
we have an artifact recovered

00:40.541 --> 00:43.083
from the wreckage
of the Avengers Compound.

00:43.166 --> 00:45.958
The Ronin decimated
the criminal underworld of the city.

00:46.041 --> 00:49.791
And his identity continues to remain
a mystery to this very day.

00:49.875 --> 00:53.166
Up next, we have a companion piece,
the Ronin Suit.

00:54.916 --> 00:56.666
We've got 90 seconds
to find the watch.

00:56.750 --> 00:57.875
Everything else is secondary.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.291
<i>Young people</i>
<i>think they're invincible,</i>

01:00.375 --> 01:01.833
<i>rich people think they're invincible.</i>

01:01.916 --> 01:03.333
And you have always been both.

01:03.416 --> 01:05.916
<i>You're not. You will get hurt.</i>
<i>Don't go out looking for it.</i>

01:06.000 --> 01:08.333
-ENRIQUE: He's here.
-MAN 1: He's here. Get him!

01:08.416 --> 01:09.708
-  Kazi!
-  We gotta go!

01:09.791 --> 01:11.291
Let's go, bro!

01:13.375 --> 01:15.375
Monogrammed butterscotch?

01:15.458 --> 01:16.500
Oh, God.

01:18.541 --> 01:21.208
<i>Authorities believe</i>
<i>the assailant could be the Ronin,</i>

01:21.291 --> 01:25.750
<i>the mysterious figure who terrorized</i>
<i>organized crime in New York and elsewhere.</i>

01:25.833 --> 01:29.833
<i>This is the first potential sighting</i>
<i>of the Ronin in years.</i>

02:13.666 --> 02:15.041
Ah, come on.

02:22.541 --> 02:23.666
Come on!

02:24.375 --> 02:25.833
You're... You're Hawkeye!

02:27.166 --> 02:28.166
Who the hell are you?

02:28.250 --> 02:31.625
I'm Kate Bishop.

02:32.416 --> 02:33.708
You're a kid.

02:36.083 --> 02:37.416
My God.

02:41.375 --> 02:42.916
How did you get this suit?

02:43.500 --> 02:45.041
I...

02:48.041 --> 02:50.791
Lookit. We gotta get you
out of here. Okay?

02:50.875 --> 02:53.416
It's not safe for you to be in this.
Do you live near here?

02:53.500 --> 02:55.041
-Yeah. I live just...
-Okay.

02:55.125 --> 02:57.083
-Yeah. Okay.
-Here, take this. Are you okay?

02:57.166 --> 02:58.291
I'm really fine. I...

02:58.375 --> 03:00.083
-Come on. Let's go.
-I saw a dead body.

03:00.166 --> 03:01.416
-This way.
-KATE: It was a first.

03:01.500 --> 03:02.708
We'll talk there.

03:08.583 --> 03:10.541
Where'd you learn to fight?

03:10.625 --> 03:13.083
I, uh, started talking martial arts
when I was five.

03:13.166 --> 03:15.541
Wow. So, like, a year ago?

03:16.916 --> 03:19.666
Are... Are you assessing threats?
Is that what you're doing?

03:19.750 --> 03:21.250
Something like that.

03:22.041 --> 03:23.041
That's how you operate?

03:23.125 --> 03:26.416
You're just constantly looking for things
that are suspicious or weird?

03:26.833 --> 03:27.833
Uh-huh.

03:30.041 --> 03:33.208
Look, just so you know,
I'm not some total noob, right? Um...

03:33.291 --> 03:36.375
I was a little overwhelmed,
but I held my own with those douchebags.

03:36.458 --> 03:37.541
We're right here.

03:37.625 --> 03:40.416
Um, some people have called me
the world's greatest archer.

03:41.208 --> 03:42.875
Yeah? Are you one of those people?

03:44.375 --> 03:46.708
Well, one of them is. Yes.

03:46.791 --> 03:47.791
That's wonderful. Yeah.

03:47.875 --> 03:49.000
-Open the door.
-Yes.

04:07.083 --> 04:08.708
Some guard dog you got there.

04:08.791 --> 04:10.833
Oh, he's, uh, not my dog.

04:14.250 --> 04:16.000
Nice place for a kid.

04:16.083 --> 04:18.708
-Yeah, I inherited it.
-What are you, 18?

04:19.875 --> 04:20.875
I'm 22.

04:20.958 --> 04:22.416
Yeah, same thing.

04:23.416 --> 04:26.833
So, wanna get that vest off,
so I can get going?

04:27.625 --> 04:28.625
Yeah.

04:30.416 --> 04:31.875
Yeah, I'll... I'll be right there.

04:33.333 --> 04:35.958
Totally cool. Just stay cool.

04:36.041 --> 04:39.250
The Hawkeye in my place.

04:43.541 --> 04:45.041
Where'd you get the suit?

04:45.500 --> 04:46.958
Black market auction.

04:49.250 --> 04:50.750
And you bought it.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.625
No. Not exactly.

04:52.708 --> 04:53.708
Uh-huh.

04:56.125 --> 04:58.000
So, what all did you do in this suit?

04:59.291 --> 05:04.250
I beat some guys up.
Saved the dog. Some light B and E.

05:05.208 --> 05:06.208
Jesus.

05:07.625 --> 05:11.416
A 22-year-old vigilante.
Shouldn't you be in school?

05:13.375 --> 05:15.250
Funny you should ask.

05:18.791 --> 05:21.541
So, uh, now that I've answered
all your questions,

05:21.625 --> 05:24.208
I have so many for you.
Uh, starting with...

05:26.000 --> 05:27.708
Can you sign this?

05:28.625 --> 05:30.125
I'm not done yet.

05:30.208 --> 05:32.083
But when you are, can you sign my bow?

05:32.958 --> 05:34.500
You're kind of my favorite Avenger.

05:34.583 --> 05:35.958
Are you okay? By the way?

05:36.041 --> 05:39.250
I'm good. Oh, yeah, no, I'm fine.
You should see the other guys.

05:39.791 --> 05:41.583
I did. Tracksuit Mafia.

05:41.666 --> 05:42.791
That's their name?

05:44.916 --> 05:46.458
That's a little on the nose.

05:48.625 --> 05:50.958
Are they the ones
that killed my mom's fiancé's uncle?

05:51.583 --> 05:53.125
Your mom's fiancé's uncle?

05:53.208 --> 05:54.833
Armand III.

05:54.916 --> 05:56.208
-Ah.
-Of at least seven.

05:57.500 --> 06:00.458
-I... I do not know.
-Hmm.

06:00.541 --> 06:03.666
But what I need to know
is if anybody saw your face?

06:04.541 --> 06:07.500
No. Kept the mask on like a pro.

06:08.375 --> 06:11.416
Okay, 'cause the person
that wore this suit

06:11.500 --> 06:12.791
made a whole lot of enemies.

06:12.875 --> 06:15.375
All right? And the Tracksuits
are just one of them.

06:16.083 --> 06:17.291
That doesn't sound good.

06:17.375 --> 06:19.708
You told nobody about this suit?

06:19.791 --> 06:20.791
No.

06:20.875 --> 06:23.250
There's no way
you're connected to this suit?

06:23.333 --> 06:24.708
-Right.
-I need you to be sure.

06:24.791 --> 06:25.833
-I am.
-Certain?

06:25.916 --> 06:26.958
Yes.

06:27.041 --> 06:30.208
The Tracksuits followed you
from the auction to where I found you.

06:30.291 --> 06:32.000
Did you stop anywhere before that?

06:32.791 --> 06:34.166
I just dropped off the dog.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.583
Hey, Kate Bishop!

06:40.291 --> 06:41.625
And my name's on the buzzer.

06:42.958 --> 06:44.375
Oh, no. Get down.

06:46.875 --> 06:48.500
Hey!

06:49.666 --> 06:51.333
We got little surprise
for you, bro!

06:51.416 --> 06:52.750
Show yourself!

06:52.833 --> 06:53.833
Come on! Throw it!

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
-Ah!
-Yeah.

07:03.166 --> 07:04.583
Put him out!

07:05.708 --> 07:07.000
What are you doing?

07:07.083 --> 07:08.500
Put him out, he's on fire!

07:10.250 --> 07:11.833
-Told ya.
-Yeah.

07:16.291 --> 07:17.708
I gotta get that suit.

07:28.833 --> 07:30.125
Come on!

07:30.208 --> 07:33.375
That's all you've got? Come on.
Throw another one.

07:34.958 --> 07:36.958
-MAN 1: My tracksuit...
-Hey, shut up!

07:39.125 --> 07:41.625
-You have a fire escape?
-My home! All my stuff!

07:41.708 --> 07:43.083
Just grab the dog and go.

07:44.125 --> 07:45.458
Wait. What about the suit?

07:45.541 --> 07:47.250
Leave it. We'll come back for it.

07:53.875 --> 07:55.166
...tryin' to do, kill us all?

07:55.375 --> 07:57.458
You're burning down
the whole freaking neighborhood.

07:57.541 --> 07:58.666
-What?
-It's a little...

07:58.750 --> 08:00.875
-I can't hear you.
-It's a lot. Everything.

08:00.958 --> 08:01.958
You were on fire.

08:02.041 --> 08:03.083
-I'm okay.
-You were on fire.

08:03.166 --> 08:04.583
-Like a little shish kebab.
-No.

08:05.416 --> 08:07.458
So where are we going?

08:07.541 --> 08:10.416
Getting further away from those people
trying to kill you.

08:10.875 --> 08:13.041
Right. And after that?

08:13.875 --> 08:15.500
We'll need some supplies.

08:15.583 --> 08:18.666
Hell yeah. Avenger supplies?

08:20.916 --> 08:24.083
Not gonna lie to you.
This is a bit of a letdown.

08:24.166 --> 08:25.583
Sorry to disappoint you.

08:25.666 --> 08:29.375
Wanna grab some of that rubbing alcohol
over there? Lower shelf.

08:35.083 --> 08:36.791
So what's the plan now?

08:37.208 --> 08:39.166
Let me guess.
We're going to your safe house?

08:39.250 --> 08:40.666
Is it in Avengers Tower?

08:40.750 --> 08:45.083
No. Tony sold that. A few years ago.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.750
That is so sad on so many levels.

08:48.833 --> 08:50.833
-Come on.

08:52.875 --> 08:54.625
-MAN: Can I get a couple of those two?
-Yeah.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.083
-CASHIER: These two right here?
-Yeah.

08:56.166 --> 08:58.208
-  You want the blue or the red?
-  Uh, red.

08:58.750 --> 09:01.291
All right. What is it?
What do you want with me?

09:01.958 --> 09:04.625
Look, I gotta find a place
to stash you. Safe.

09:04.708 --> 09:07.291
So I can recover the suit
and clean your mess.

09:07.375 --> 09:10.083
Stash me? I'm not a bag of money.

09:10.458 --> 09:12.875
No, you're not.
A bag of money'd be useful to me.

09:12.958 --> 09:13.958
Next.

09:14.041 --> 09:15.708
Hi, how are you? Merry Christmas.

09:16.916 --> 09:19.000
I actually do know a place
about 10 blocks away.

09:19.083 --> 09:21.000
Would a bag of money know a place?

09:28.916 --> 09:30.375
Hmm...

09:31.958 --> 09:32.958
Okay.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.541
-MAN 2: <i>Y'ello.</i>

09:40.625 --> 09:43.500
Yes, hey, uh... Hi. Yeah, we're...
Uh, I got pizza.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.750
-I got pi... Uh-huh.
<i>-Huh? What?</i>

09:45.833 --> 09:47.750
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Mm. Yep. That's...

10:02.458 --> 10:03.666
Okay.

10:04.333 --> 10:08.000
Okay, not exactly a fortress,
but it'll do, right?

10:08.083 --> 10:11.083
It's my aunt's place.
She's in Florida for the winter.

10:11.166 --> 10:12.166
Hold that for me.

10:17.125 --> 10:18.125
Right.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.541
-Is there cats in here?
-Mm.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.000
-Just cat hair.

10:32.125 --> 10:33.166
Okay.

10:35.583 --> 10:40.166
Here. I need you to clean your wounds.
Use this. Use soap, this and disinfect it.

10:40.250 --> 10:43.041
All right. I'm going back
to your apartment to get that suit.

10:43.125 --> 10:44.708
And then I'm going back to my kids.

10:44.791 --> 10:46.833
Oh, yes, Clint,
you may enter my apartment.

10:46.916 --> 10:47.916
Don't you need my keys?

10:48.000 --> 10:51.458
Nope. I'm good. Stay here. Lock this door.

11:01.333 --> 11:03.250
Yeah, Captain wants
to keep everybody back.

11:27.958 --> 11:29.500
All right, sounds good.

11:31.375 --> 11:34.125
...closing up the shop.
They headed down...

11:39.416 --> 11:41.833
Go ahead
and break up that wall, all right?

11:47.083 --> 11:48.750
Hey, whoa, whoa! Look over here.

12:01.083 --> 12:03.125
You got
another circuit interrupter?

12:05.750 --> 12:07.000
Coming down.

12:07.958 --> 12:09.166
It's clear up there.

12:15.333 --> 12:16.541
Where is it?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.083
<i>I was so scared.</i>
<i>What happened to you?</i>

12:55.166 --> 12:57.500
Nothing. I went out the back.

12:58.958 --> 13:00.083
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:00.166 --> 13:01.250
<i>That was crazy.</i>

13:01.333 --> 13:05.166
<i>An explosion?</i>
<i>Some kind of black market auction?</i>

13:05.250 --> 13:07.750
-I gotta go. Love you.
<i>-I love you, too.</i>

13:08.416 --> 13:11.666
When did everybody start saying,
"I love you," to everybody all the time?

13:11.750 --> 13:12.750
That was my mom.

13:12.833 --> 13:15.000
Since when did your heart
shrink three sizes?

13:15.083 --> 13:17.958
When a little girl in a ninja costume
stole my Christmas.

13:30.375 --> 13:31.375
What?

13:31.458 --> 13:33.833
-Multitasking.
-Hmm.

13:33.916 --> 13:35.125
Reducing swelling.

13:35.208 --> 13:36.750
Thawing out Pizza Dog's breakfast.

13:36.833 --> 13:38.291
Is that the, uh, dog's name?

13:38.375 --> 13:40.250
He doesn't have a name.

13:40.333 --> 13:43.000
It's more of a title of nobility.

13:44.166 --> 13:46.750
Like Earl of Sandwich.

13:48.708 --> 13:50.208
How's your wound?

13:50.833 --> 13:54.791
Uh, all right.
It still hurts a little bit.

13:54.875 --> 13:57.041
-Oh, shit.

13:57.625 --> 13:59.333
-What?
-Did you clean it?

14:00.416 --> 14:03.166
-Yeah.
-You did it all wrong.

14:03.250 --> 14:05.458
Let me fix it. Okay?

14:05.541 --> 14:08.333
-You're taking it off?
-Yeah. It's on wrong.

14:08.416 --> 14:10.750
And I'm just gonna rip it off
like a Band-Aid. Okay?

14:10.833 --> 14:12.666
-Ready. One. Oh. Oh.

14:13.458 --> 14:15.083
All right. Just gonna clean it up.

14:17.458 --> 14:19.833
You don't want this infected,
it'll ruin your week.

14:19.916 --> 14:21.833
-Ooh. That's actually not so bad.
-Okay.

14:21.916 --> 14:24.666
It's a deep scratch.
Want these perpendicular to it,

14:24.750 --> 14:27.083
you wanna close it.
This is helping it cinch.

14:27.166 --> 14:31.166
So it can mend to each other faster.

14:31.916 --> 14:33.416
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-All good?

14:34.125 --> 14:35.208
So, how's my place?

14:36.333 --> 14:37.375
Crispy.

14:39.375 --> 14:40.708
Did you get the suit?

14:40.791 --> 14:41.791
No.

14:42.333 --> 14:43.916
But you have a lead.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.666
What makes you say that?

14:47.916 --> 14:49.333
What is this?

14:49.916 --> 14:52.375
Oh, I started to describe, um,

14:53.041 --> 14:56.541
what I could remember
of the Tracksuits' faces.

14:56.625 --> 14:58.166
I guess you're not an art major.

14:58.250 --> 14:59.250
Okay.

15:00.416 --> 15:05.375
Um, I would offer to buy you a hotel,
uh, 'cause from certain angles,

15:05.458 --> 15:07.416
I know this all looks like my fault.

15:07.500 --> 15:13.083
Um, but my mom cancelled my credit cards
due to the whole clock tower.

15:13.166 --> 15:14.625
That's not necessary.

15:14.708 --> 15:16.708
I'm just gonna be another minute, kid.

15:16.791 --> 15:20.791
Okay. Thank you for...

15:25.000 --> 15:27.250
I'll, um, see you tomorrow, I guess.

15:39.291 --> 15:40.458
Oh, man.

15:40.541 --> 15:43.166
<i>People always like,</i>
<i>"Grills, when you gettin' a new costume?</i>

15:43.250 --> 15:45.041
<i>"Your costume looks pretty bad."</i>

15:45.125 --> 15:47.166
<i>How about now? You see me?</i>

15:47.250 --> 15:49.583
<i>When you see me</i>
<i>sneakin' and creepin', it's too late.</i>

15:49.666 --> 15:51.583
<i>You're already dead. Ninja style.</i>

15:53.208 --> 15:55.083
Oh, shit.

16:13.083 --> 16:15.083
I'll be back in the morning, buddy.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.458
You're a good dog.

16:22.833 --> 16:24.500
Have a great holiday!

16:24.583 --> 16:25.875
Okay.

16:26.458 --> 16:27.750
Cooper, off your phone.

16:29.625 --> 16:30.791
Okay, guys.

16:31.375 --> 16:33.291
Thank you.
This is a car to the airport.

16:33.375 --> 16:35.750
Once you get to the airport,
Cooper's in charge.

16:35.833 --> 16:37.333
No donuts, buddy.

16:37.416 --> 16:40.208
What? Why's he in charge? He's an idiot.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.916
But I got seniority.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
When you land,
your mom is gonna be waiting there, okay?

16:45.083 --> 16:46.500
Is this about the ninja?

16:46.583 --> 16:47.875
No, it's not about the ninja.

16:47.958 --> 16:50.958
Most importantly, remember these words,
"Don't lose Nate." Okay?

16:51.041 --> 16:52.125
Where is Nate?

16:52.208 --> 16:53.375
Where is Nate?

16:53.458 --> 16:54.916
Guys, get in the car, please.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.875
Nate, come on, buddy.

16:56.958 --> 16:59.708
Okay. Come on.

16:59.791 --> 17:01.500
Come on, buddy. What did you eat?

17:02.416 --> 17:03.958
You ready?

17:04.708 --> 17:06.000
Okay, buddy.

17:09.541 --> 17:12.000
I love you, Dad.

17:12.083 --> 17:14.375
I love you more.

17:16.541 --> 17:18.958
Now get inside, buddy.
Come on, Lila, let's go.

17:19.041 --> 17:20.166
Huh? What's with this face?

17:20.250 --> 17:22.541
You have a cut on your forehead, Dad.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.750
What's going on?
Should we be worried?

17:24.833 --> 17:29.666
No, no. It's nothing. Daddy's got this.
It's no big deal. Okay? Come on.

17:32.791 --> 17:35.375
I really thought you were gonna be
home for Christmas.

17:35.458 --> 17:38.958
Hey, look at me.
I'll be home for Christmas.

17:39.041 --> 17:40.708
-Promise me. Promise?
-Yeah, okay.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.416
I said Coop's in charge,

17:44.500 --> 17:46.000
he's not. You're in charge.

17:46.083 --> 17:48.416
You always have been.
Look after these boys.

17:48.500 --> 17:49.916
Merry Christmas. See you soon.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.416
-Keep your word, okay?
-BARTON: I will. I promise.

17:54.291 --> 17:55.750
-You guys be safe, okay?
-Okay.

17:55.833 --> 17:57.416
Call me when you get home? I love you.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.666
Bye, Dad.

17:58.750 --> 18:00.666
Bye, Dad. Don't worry. I got this.

18:00.750 --> 18:03.583
-  Cooper, you do not got this.
-  Love you!

18:07.541 --> 18:10.875
<i>A major NYPD investigation is underway.</i>

18:10.958 --> 18:15.041
<i>New York socialite Armand Ducane</i>
<i>was found dead in his home last night.</i>

18:15.125 --> 18:17.958
<i>Witnesses saw</i>
<i>a mysterious figure leaving the scene.</i>

18:18.041 --> 18:19.458
But that's...

18:21.500 --> 18:23.000
-Yeah.
<i>-The description matches</i>

18:23.083 --> 18:25.958
<i>the masked assailant</i>
<i>from last night's auction robbery.</i>

18:26.041 --> 18:28.083
<i>These two events have officials wondering</i>

18:28.166 --> 18:30.708
<i>if indeed, the Ronin</i>
<i>has returned to New York City,</i>

18:30.791 --> 18:33.375
<i>if he may be responsible</i>
<i>for Armand Ducane's death,</i>

18:33.458 --> 18:35.333
<i>and what he may do next.</i>

18:35.416 --> 18:40.750
Oh, my God. Wait. Wait, they think I...
They think I'm that... vigilante?

18:40.833 --> 18:44.458
It's been less than 24 hours,
you've been on the news twice. Impressive.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.416
Told you that suit was bad news.

18:48.208 --> 18:49.708
Clint, I gotta go.

18:49.791 --> 18:53.375
Uh, no, no, no. That is, uh,
the last thing you need to do, actually.

18:53.458 --> 18:57.250
Let's not forget the Tracksuit guys
trying to kill you twice yesterday.

18:59.083 --> 19:03.541
I'm going to find this suit,
and until I do, you're gonna stay put.

19:04.125 --> 19:05.625
It's not safe, obviously.

19:05.708 --> 19:07.958
Not showing up at work is not safe.

19:09.208 --> 19:10.666
My mom is already high strung.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.583
Surprised she hasn't called me already.

19:13.083 --> 19:14.500
Just stay put, please.

19:14.583 --> 19:19.583
Look, if I stay put,
she's just gonna come and find me, anyway.

19:19.666 --> 19:23.125
She owns a security company.
It's literally the safest place I can go.

19:23.208 --> 19:26.125
Yeah, no. You're just
not gonna listen to me, are you?

19:27.916 --> 19:30.666
I want to, but no.

19:31.250 --> 19:32.416
Go get changed.

19:32.500 --> 19:33.875
You look silly.

19:33.958 --> 19:35.958
All right, I'll go see what else she has.

19:40.458 --> 19:42.041
I'm gonna be late, thanks to you.

19:42.125 --> 19:44.125
You're gonna be alive 'cause of me.

19:44.916 --> 19:46.416
Hey, man, here you go.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.000
-All right.
-Oh.

19:48.083 --> 19:50.291
Being a gentleman,
walking on the outside. Nice.

19:50.375 --> 19:52.875
No, no, it's just so I can hear you.

19:52.958 --> 19:55.041
And to be clear, not 'cause I want to,

19:55.125 --> 19:56.750
-just 'cause I need to.
-Oh.

19:56.833 --> 19:57.875
What happened?

20:03.458 --> 20:04.958
Uh, too hard to tell.

20:05.041 --> 20:07.375
Mommy, Mommy, a superhero.

20:07.458 --> 20:09.791
Wow, Stevie, you wanna say hi?

20:12.208 --> 20:13.333
Come on, kid!

20:13.416 --> 20:14.583
Puny tourist.

20:15.416 --> 20:16.833
-KATE: Hey, look, that one's you.
-No.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.250
That's Katniss Everdeen. Let's go.

20:20.166 --> 20:21.458
Your problem is branding.

20:21.541 --> 20:22.708
No, my problem is you.

20:23.583 --> 20:24.791
And this ninja suit,

20:24.875 --> 20:27.083
and the people trying to kill you
'cause of it.

20:27.166 --> 20:29.583
It's a problem
that I'm going to solve today,

20:29.666 --> 20:30.875
so I can go home to my family.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.666
No, it's branding.

20:32.750 --> 20:36.458
Your whole thing is that you're low-key.
It's a very hard brand to sell.

20:36.541 --> 20:38.875
Well, I'm not really trying
to sell anything.

20:38.958 --> 20:40.583
It should technically make you cooler,

20:40.666 --> 20:43.833
but with the scary stuff that's
happened since the Avengers appeared,

20:43.916 --> 20:47.041
people don't want that cynical,
cool thing anymore.

20:47.125 --> 20:48.625
They want sincerity.

20:48.708 --> 20:50.250
-That right?
-Not self-seriousness,

20:50.333 --> 20:52.375
but a heart-on-your-sleeve sincerity.

20:52.458 --> 20:53.916
I see.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.875
You are very contained.
Keep your cards close to your vest,

20:56.958 --> 21:01.708
which you wear over a suit of armor and,
like, 16 other layers of self-protection.

21:01.791 --> 21:04.916
All of which, under, finally,
is your heart.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.250
So, not exactly on your sleeve.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.458
Again, not really trying to sell anything.

21:09.541 --> 21:11.500
But you do, anyway.

21:11.583 --> 21:17.000
Yeah, okay, Kate.
Um, what am I selling, then, huh?

21:17.083 --> 21:20.541
It's certainly not Halloween costumes
or toys off the shelf.

21:20.625 --> 21:22.500
Inspiration, Clint.

21:26.416 --> 21:29.166
The office is here. Shall we meet
at the safehouse after work?

21:29.250 --> 21:30.541
Uh...

21:31.833 --> 21:34.083
Uh, if all goes as planned today,

21:34.166 --> 21:36.500
this is gonna be
the last time we see each other.

21:38.416 --> 21:40.666
All you've taught me is how to lose a tail

21:40.750 --> 21:42.000
and I almost already knew that.

21:42.083 --> 21:44.583
Right, maybe I taught you
how to bandage a wound.

21:44.666 --> 21:46.583
-How's that?
-But what about trick arrows?

21:46.666 --> 21:48.791
There are no trick arrows, Kate.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.875
Here, put your phone number in here.
For emergencies only.

21:53.458 --> 21:54.791
Just go inside. Stay safe.

21:57.375 --> 21:59.458
-Just lettin' it ring, so I have...
-Gotcha.

21:59.541 --> 22:01.083
...your number.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.166
Emergencies only,
or I'll block and delete you.

22:05.250 --> 22:07.041
Um, this is goodbye.

22:07.791 --> 22:09.708
-Okay.
-Great. Merry Christmas.

22:09.791 --> 22:10.791
-All right.
-Okay?

22:10.875 --> 22:13.375
Cool. Call you later.

22:13.458 --> 22:14.750
No, please don't.

22:15.541 --> 22:16.875
I got your number.

22:20.666 --> 22:24.166
That'll work. We can put it
in her calendar for now and...

22:24.250 --> 22:26.250
Hey. Back in a sec, D.

22:30.083 --> 22:32.208
-Oh. Hi, Kate. Nope. Oh.
-Good mornin'.

22:32.291 --> 22:33.958
I'm sorry. I know. Before you say it...

22:34.041 --> 22:35.500
Katy.

22:36.208 --> 22:37.375
Good morning.

22:37.791 --> 22:38.833
Kate.

22:40.416 --> 22:44.375
Sorry for your loss.
I, um, saw it on the news.

22:46.583 --> 22:48.625
Thank you, Kate.
That's very sweet of you.

22:50.416 --> 22:52.375
He was very dear to me.

22:52.458 --> 22:55.291
Must've come as quite a shock.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.708
It did.

22:57.583 --> 22:59.000
It did, indeed.

22:59.833 --> 23:01.666
You two were probably really close.

23:02.500 --> 23:06.208
Well, we had a special relationship.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.458
What about the inheritance?

23:10.541 --> 23:12.333
Kate, what are you wearing?

23:12.416 --> 23:13.958
Oh, this, it's, um...

23:15.625 --> 23:17.125
A friend's. Just borrowing it.

23:17.208 --> 23:20.166
What's this I hear about a fire
in your apartment last night?

23:20.250 --> 23:22.583
I can explain. Can we talk?

23:22.666 --> 23:23.875
Without the interloper?

23:23.958 --> 23:25.875
-Please.
-No, no, it makes perfect sense

23:25.958 --> 23:27.791
that she would be hostile.

23:27.875 --> 23:30.666
She likely feels displaced by me,

23:30.750 --> 23:33.083
and she's testing our new dynamic.

23:33.666 --> 23:38.333
She both desires my approval,
yet wants to set firm boundaries.

23:39.208 --> 23:41.625
She feels threatened by me,
and you know what?

23:41.708 --> 23:43.083
I can understand why.

23:46.833 --> 23:49.333
I bought a book. About being a stepdad.

23:52.291 --> 23:53.916
Money well spent, Jack.

23:55.291 --> 23:56.791
Kate,

23:56.875 --> 23:59.041
Jack's cooking dinner.
Why don't you join us?

23:59.125 --> 24:00.125
Fine.

24:01.833 --> 24:02.875
On one condition.

24:03.708 --> 24:05.166
What's that?

24:05.833 --> 24:09.250
I come up with the conversation topics.

24:40.958 --> 24:42.291
-A quill please, sir?
-Here you go.

24:44.875 --> 24:47.250
-Hi.
-MAN: Hey.

24:49.583 --> 24:50.666
Ah, there you are.

24:52.375 --> 24:55.125
Uh, Hey. There's no looky-loos.

24:55.208 --> 24:58.083
Uh, I'm not trying
to cause any trouble here.

24:58.166 --> 25:01.500
I just wanna talk to
that ninja, right there?

25:01.583 --> 25:02.791
Stole that suit.

25:02.875 --> 25:04.916
So, I'd like to talk to him.

25:05.833 --> 25:06.833
Ah.

25:07.916 --> 25:10.375
So, you can take that up with him
when the LARP is over.

25:12.083 --> 25:15.500
The Live Action Role Play.
This, you know... This whole thing.

25:15.583 --> 25:18.208
-Wait, when is it over?
-Midnight.

25:18.291 --> 25:20.875
Yeah, that's not gonna work.
It's just gonna take a couple minutes...

25:20.958 --> 25:22.458
Uh... Hey.

25:22.541 --> 25:24.125
Look, I know who you are,

25:24.208 --> 25:28.333
but most of those folks out there
are firefighters and cops.

25:29.041 --> 25:32.333
And if you break the rules,
it's gonna get real messy.

25:39.166 --> 25:40.500
What are the rules?

25:43.083 --> 25:46.416
-WOMAN: Name?
-Uh, yeah, no, thank you.

25:46.500 --> 25:47.791
Email?

25:47.875 --> 25:49.416
That's classified.

25:50.208 --> 25:51.875
-Title? Organization?
-All right, yeah.

25:51.958 --> 25:56.041
Let me just sign it, and, uh,
we'll get this show on the road.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.041
So, your scroll details
your character's mission.

26:03.875 --> 26:06.125
-Right.
-Beginners only get one free hit.

26:06.208 --> 26:08.250
If you get hit in the torso, it's fatal.

26:10.416 --> 26:11.458
Oh.

26:11.541 --> 26:14.041
-So violent.
-Just watch what other people are doing.

26:14.125 --> 26:15.708
And have fun.

26:15.791 --> 26:17.791
What do you do with this?

26:18.416 --> 26:20.166
That's what you live by.

26:25.375 --> 26:28.083
-Okay. Thank you.
-Wait, wait, wait, your armaments.

26:30.166 --> 26:31.875
Helmet.

26:33.291 --> 26:35.125
I mean, do I have to?

27:37.375 --> 27:38.750
Goodness!

27:43.708 --> 27:46.541
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm a Viking. I'm really a Viking.

27:46.666 --> 27:47.916
I don't care.

27:49.500 --> 27:52.166
Wait a minute. Aren't you Hawkeye?

27:52.250 --> 27:54.583
I'm not trying
to cause a scene here, all right?

27:54.666 --> 27:56.583
Out of respect

27:56.666 --> 27:59.291
to whatever the hell this is,
but I'm plumb out of patience.

27:59.375 --> 28:00.958
You got two choices.

28:01.041 --> 28:04.166
I could take this pretend-sword

28:04.250 --> 28:07.125
and you pretend to die
and I take that suit,

28:07.208 --> 28:08.875
or I'm gonna real punch you

28:09.541 --> 28:12.500
and you're gonna real fall down
and I'm gonna take that suit.

28:15.083 --> 28:16.125
Just let me kill you.

28:16.708 --> 28:18.208
And I'll give you the suit.

28:19.750 --> 28:22.500
-No.
-Come on, man.

28:22.583 --> 28:24.375
You're a superhero in real life.

28:24.458 --> 28:27.083
This is as close as I'm ever
gonna get to being one.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.458
Just work with me. Let me kill you.

28:34.833 --> 28:36.041
And I fought Thanos.

28:37.125 --> 28:38.958
-Okay.
-All right, cool.

28:39.041 --> 28:40.500
-Just make it quick.
-Yeah.

28:40.583 --> 28:45.166
What? No, you gotta make it look real.
We gotta have trial by combat.

28:59.416 --> 29:02.541
Okay, so, I was kinda mean,
but I think it worked.

29:02.625 --> 29:03.916
<i>Kate Bishop?</i>

29:06.250 --> 29:08.125
Uh, depends who's asking.

29:08.208 --> 29:11.708
This is Detective Caudle
of the New York Police Department asking.

29:13.458 --> 29:15.833
Then it depends what you're asking.

29:15.916 --> 29:18.166
<i>I'm asking if this is Kate Bishop.</i>

29:19.166 --> 29:20.291
Yeah, it is.

29:21.208 --> 29:24.333
Ms. Bishop, can you come down
to the station for a quick chat?

29:24.666 --> 29:27.250
Uh, I'm... I'm sort of unclear
what the rules are here.

29:27.333 --> 29:30.333
Am I, um,
able to ask what this is regarding?

29:30.416 --> 29:33.625
Are you aware there was a fire
in your apartment last night?

29:34.916 --> 29:36.625
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:36.708 --> 29:38.333
Totally, totally.

29:38.416 --> 29:40.833
<i>-You don't seem too upset about it.</i>

29:40.916 --> 29:45.541
Well, I wasn't home,
so, thankfully, uh, I'm... I'm fine.

29:46.666 --> 29:48.833
<i>Mind telling me where you were last night?</i>

29:50.375 --> 29:51.666
Yeah. I, um...

29:51.750 --> 29:53.500
Mm-hmm. Uh...

29:54.458 --> 29:56.333
I'm actually at work right now.

29:56.416 --> 29:58.541
How about tomorrow morning before work?

29:58.625 --> 30:01.291
That'd be great. See... See you tomorrow.

30:09.291 --> 30:10.333
Welcome!

30:10.416 --> 30:12.916
-Now, you must drink

30:13.000 --> 30:15.083
the ritualistic potion.

30:15.166 --> 30:17.250
-It is a bottle.
-Right, I'm good, thank you.

30:17.333 --> 30:19.833
Can we just please...
Let's get on with this.

30:19.916 --> 30:22.000
Uh-oh. You're not gonna reap the benefits.

30:24.125 --> 30:26.916
-He didn't drink the potion?
-WOMAN: What is he thinking?

30:27.000 --> 30:29.250
Winner takes the suit.

30:29.750 --> 30:31.291
Proceed!

30:35.625 --> 30:36.625
Come on.

30:36.708 --> 30:38.041
Cling.

30:39.208 --> 30:42.583
Cling. Cling. Cling.

30:42.666 --> 30:46.500
Cling.

30:46.583 --> 30:47.708
What you doin'?

30:47.791 --> 30:49.666
I'm trying to sell it.
You gotta make it real.

30:49.750 --> 30:51.250
-They gotta believe it.
-Just kill me.

31:02.250 --> 31:03.375
You ready?

31:03.458 --> 31:05.000
I'm begging you. Kill me.

31:05.083 --> 31:06.625
Finish him!

31:10.416 --> 31:14.208
Yes! Yes! Yes!

31:15.958 --> 31:16.958
Winner!

31:17.041 --> 31:19.166
For Mount Deepdale!

31:19.250 --> 31:20.375
-LARPER 2: Huzzah!
-GRILLS: Yes!

31:20.458 --> 31:22.083
-Yes!
-GIRL IN BRAIDS: And now,

31:22.166 --> 31:24.583
we burn the corpse!

31:24.666 --> 31:26.208
Burn the corpse!

31:33.125 --> 31:36.583
-Oh.
-Noble Mayor of Westland. Thank you.

31:36.666 --> 31:40.916
I shall be regaling my countrymen
with this tale for many years to come.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.666
You can call me Clint.

31:43.500 --> 31:45.083
I... I can call you Clint?

31:45.166 --> 31:46.416
Yeah.

31:46.500 --> 31:49.416
-You could take this to the front desk.
-Yeah.

31:49.500 --> 31:52.583
-Can't have that on my credit card.
-Nah, they will charge you.

31:52.666 --> 31:53.750
Yeah.

31:55.083 --> 31:57.541
No, but, seriously, thank you.
I owe you one.

31:57.625 --> 32:00.458
This has been, like,
the best day of my life.

32:00.541 --> 32:02.583
I can't say the same.

32:02.666 --> 32:06.375
I mean, come on. You did have fun, right?

32:07.666 --> 32:09.083
I'm glad I did it.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.083
Merry Christmas.

32:12.166 --> 32:14.333
You, too, Clint.

32:14.416 --> 32:17.458
-Take care.
-Oh! I'm... I'm... I'm Grills.

32:17.541 --> 32:19.291
Nice to meet you, Grills.

32:19.833 --> 32:22.791
-  Where's the frosting?
-  Don't mess up my house.

32:22.875 --> 32:23.958
Hi, hon.

32:24.041 --> 32:26.583
I'm not gonna make my flight.

32:26.666 --> 32:29.750
<i>That's all right.</i>
<i>That's what, uh, flight insurance is for.</i>

32:29.833 --> 32:31.291
There's never enough frosting.

32:31.375 --> 32:32.500
How bad is it?

32:32.583 --> 32:34.250
One more day, I think.

32:35.666 --> 32:37.250
How's the problematic wardrobe?

32:38.500 --> 32:40.083
Yeah, safe.

32:40.708 --> 32:42.416
I need to hang on it for insurance.

32:42.500 --> 32:44.333
At least, until I

32:44.416 --> 32:46.916
clear things up
with the old Tracksuit friends.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.208
Jesus, not those idiots.

32:49.833 --> 32:51.375
Yeah, those idiots.

32:51.458 --> 32:53.625
I'm not sure how high it goes up,

32:53.708 --> 32:55.791
so I just gotta stick around a bit longer.

32:58.708 --> 33:00.083
I promised...

33:00.166 --> 33:01.958
I promised Lila
I'd be there for Christmas.

33:03.875 --> 33:07.458
Well, then you have five days
to keep that promise.

33:08.708 --> 33:10.083
Yeah.

33:12.166 --> 33:14.791
I'm missing out on, uh,
gingerbread house construction.

33:14.875 --> 33:19.541
Nah, it's okay. You'd have slowed us down.
What's the play?

33:21.333 --> 33:24.166
-A little catch release.
-Nice.

33:24.250 --> 33:25.833
One of Nat's old moves.

33:27.625 --> 33:29.833
<i>-Be careful.</i>
-Yeah.

33:32.666 --> 33:36.208
Send me pictures.
I wanna see the disaster.

33:36.833 --> 33:38.500
Time to get myself caught.

33:39.750 --> 33:42.500
You guys, come on. We gotta finish!

33:43.000 --> 33:45.166
That was delicious, Jack. Thank you.

33:45.250 --> 33:46.916
-I'm so glad you liked it.
-KATE: Mmm.

33:47.583 --> 33:50.833
The secret to a good risotto is to

33:51.375 --> 33:52.375
agitate it.

33:52.458 --> 33:53.708
Just enough.

33:54.416 --> 33:57.625
And then it's just down to
patience and attention.

33:58.541 --> 33:59.541
Wow.

34:01.375 --> 34:04.083
You cook, you're attentive,
you're wealthy.

34:05.500 --> 34:07.083
You're almost too good to be true.

34:10.333 --> 34:12.125
I assure you, I am not.

34:14.416 --> 34:15.416
Hmm.

34:16.250 --> 34:19.916
So, it seems you're quite
the sword aficionado, Jack. Do you fence?

34:21.916 --> 34:22.916
I dabble.

34:24.208 --> 34:27.291
Would you say you're more
an épée, foil, or sabre man?

34:27.375 --> 34:28.708
Oh.

34:28.791 --> 34:30.750
You know your stuff, little lady.

34:32.291 --> 34:34.291
I was a two-time state champion.

34:34.875 --> 34:36.583
Good with all the outdated weapons.

34:36.666 --> 34:39.750
Made me aware of when someone
is trying to stab you in the back.

34:39.833 --> 34:43.166
Okay, I think you've both proven
that you know what swords are.

34:43.250 --> 34:44.916
-Can we move on now?
-Oh, but, dear,

34:45.000 --> 34:50.041
I think a common interest is
very fertile ground for bonding.

34:54.458 --> 34:56.208
That's exactly what I was thinking.

34:56.750 --> 34:58.083
-Bonding.
-JACK: Mm.

34:59.166 --> 35:02.291
-Let's break out these bad boys.
-Please, let's not, okay?

35:02.375 --> 35:04.083
We've had enough drama this week.

35:05.291 --> 35:06.291
Yeah.

35:06.375 --> 35:09.291
You know, perhaps...
perhaps your mother is right.

35:09.375 --> 35:12.250
Oh, come on, why not?
You've got some spare fencing gear.

35:14.458 --> 35:16.791
-I'm convinced.
-All she said was, "Why not?"

35:16.875 --> 35:20.166
That's not a convincing argument.
That's not an argument at all.

35:20.250 --> 35:21.291
And yet...

35:23.708 --> 35:25.375
I'm gonna go get my stuff.

35:30.458 --> 35:31.583
What?

35:32.750 --> 35:33.791
This'll be fun.

35:45.833 --> 35:47.125
Honey, be careful.

35:47.208 --> 35:49.458
When am I not careful?

35:50.625 --> 35:52.250
I was talking to Jack.

36:09.541 --> 36:11.833
Wow. You are good.

36:12.416 --> 36:14.125
Don't let me win, Jack.

36:14.208 --> 36:17.041
I wouldn't. Go again?

36:27.125 --> 36:30.333
Oh! Caught me again.
Wow, you are good.

36:30.916 --> 36:34.250
Kate, I prefer a fiancé
with four limbs, please.

36:34.333 --> 36:36.125
Stop letting me win.

36:36.208 --> 36:38.666
I... I'm not. Honest. I mean,

36:39.541 --> 36:42.583
-two-time state champ, right?

36:54.333 --> 36:55.583
Oh!

36:56.166 --> 36:57.583
What are you hiding, Jack?

36:59.541 --> 37:02.250
Nothing. I'm an open book.

37:02.875 --> 37:03.958
Right, darling?

37:04.541 --> 37:06.041
Kate!

37:09.125 --> 37:10.416
What is wrong with you?

37:10.500 --> 37:11.541
He's lying.

37:11.625 --> 37:15.041
To be fair, I did downplay my skill

37:15.125 --> 37:17.625
and repeatedly lie about it.

37:17.708 --> 37:18.916
She tried to stab you.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.333
No, I knew he would parry.
What I was trying to do was

37:21.416 --> 37:23.833
prove that he is lying,
which I successfully did.

37:24.833 --> 37:26.458
I'm gonna go change.

37:32.666 --> 37:34.625
I cannot believe you.

37:37.333 --> 37:39.416
Jack is hiding something, Mom.

37:40.250 --> 37:44.291
Don't you think it's a little strange that
the same night his uncle threatens you,

37:44.375 --> 37:47.625
-he ends up murdered by sword?

37:47.708 --> 37:50.500
How many people get murdered by sword
each year in New York?

37:50.583 --> 37:52.208
I'm gonna go ahead and guess zero.

37:52.291 --> 37:53.958
Kate, it's sweet that you're worried,

37:54.041 --> 37:56.791
but just remember I'm the mom.
It's my job to protect you.

37:56.875 --> 37:59.208
-I'm not a kid anymore.
-You're not a superhero either.

37:59.958 --> 38:04.833
Okay? What happened to Armand is terrible,
but the police will handle it.

38:05.916 --> 38:07.791
I don't want you doing
any more snooping.

38:07.875 --> 38:12.000
You could get really hurt, and we're not
talking scrapes on the knee anymore, Kate.

38:12.083 --> 38:16.875
Mom, there was more. There was
a ninja suit and a street gang.

38:16.958 --> 38:18.958
-Molotov cocktails...
-Street gang?

38:19.041 --> 38:23.333
Ninjas? What exactly is in
a Molotov cocktail, anyway?

38:23.416 --> 38:25.250
Are you... Are you old enough to drink?

38:25.833 --> 38:28.916
-Kate, everything will be okay.

38:31.208 --> 38:33.666
Okay, I get being scared
at the uncertainty

38:33.750 --> 38:35.416
of what comes next in life,

38:35.500 --> 38:37.375
but we know what comes next for you.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.416
You'll graduate, and in the fall,

38:39.500 --> 38:41.541
you'll start working at Bishop Security.

38:41.625 --> 38:43.875
-Like we've always planned.
-Like you've always planned.

38:43.958 --> 38:48.291
Kate, just put one foot
in front of the other,

38:48.375 --> 38:50.791
and in a few years, you'll look up,
and I promise,

38:50.875 --> 38:53.458
you will be happy
where you are. I promise.

38:55.041 --> 38:57.125
Okay? Can we just put all this behind us?

38:58.541 --> 39:00.333
Hon? Okay? Why don't you start

39:00.416 --> 39:02.708
by apologizing to Jack?

39:09.250 --> 39:10.916
Sorry for scaring you
into telling the truth.

39:12.583 --> 39:14.250
Smart as a whip, this one, huh?

39:14.333 --> 39:16.000
Would you like a drink, darling?

39:18.416 --> 39:20.333
-ELEANOR: Are you okay?
-I'm fine, I'm fine.

39:20.416 --> 39:23.708
It's not the first time
somebody tried to take my head off.

39:29.291 --> 39:30.458
Butterscotch?

39:37.458 --> 39:39.208
Kate. What's wrong?

39:39.291 --> 39:40.833
Nothing. No, I'm fine.

39:40.916 --> 39:43.000
I, uh, just remembered what time it is.

39:43.083 --> 39:45.541
-It's a work thing.
-If it's for work, I'm your boss.

39:45.625 --> 39:47.833
I can get you out of it.
What's going on?

39:47.916 --> 39:50.791
Uh, nothing. Everything's fine.
I'm gonna call you later.

39:50.875 --> 39:53.375
Uh, okay. Love you!

40:04.416 --> 40:05.541
Come on, guys.

40:06.291 --> 40:08.000
Let's just get this over with.

40:08.958 --> 40:09.958
What's up, bro?

40:10.708 --> 40:12.791
Hello, boys. You found me.

40:15.083 --> 40:16.375
Hey, easy, bro.

40:16.458 --> 40:18.250
Hey, Hawkeye,
you have some place to be?

40:18.833 --> 40:20.291
-You gonna be a little late!

40:21.041 --> 40:22.541
-Come on.
-IVAN: Easy, easy.

40:22.625 --> 40:24.208
-Come on.
-She wants him alive.

40:25.166 --> 40:27.416
-IVAN: Careful now.

40:27.500 --> 40:28.875
Go!

40:28.958 --> 40:30.583
Guys, I can see through the bag.

40:31.416 --> 40:33.125
Ivan, that was easy, eh?

40:50.541 --> 40:52.416
-Where to?
-Hi, goin' to Fourth and B.

40:52.500 --> 40:53.750
You got it.

40:54.416 --> 40:59.458
Clint, uh, hi, it's me.
I, uh, I have a crazy clue

40:59.541 --> 41:01.833
to tell you about. ''Clues.'' Plural.

41:01.916 --> 41:04.375
Um, so, yeah, call me back, okay? Bye.

41:07.166 --> 41:11.333
Should I try again? I should try again.
I'mma try again.

41:14.708 --> 41:17.041
Sometimes back-to-back calls
isn't the right move.

41:17.125 --> 41:18.791
In this case, it was.

41:18.875 --> 41:22.166
<i>I'm sorry, Clint Barton can't</i>
<i>take your call right now.</i>

41:42.500 --> 41:44.666
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to speed up. Please.

41:53.541 --> 41:57.750
I'm just saying, you spend
so much time devoted to learning a skill,

41:57.833 --> 42:00.083
you might as well freelance, you know?

42:01.208 --> 42:02.583
Wakey-wakey, bro.

42:10.041 --> 42:11.666
It's a nice place you got here.

42:13.791 --> 42:14.916
Not creepy at all.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.916
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You kid.

42:17.541 --> 42:20.041
I know you kid. So, don't kid, okay?

42:20.125 --> 42:23.166
Because it was getting
very hard to find place.

42:23.250 --> 42:25.791
Now, all the warehouses
are being converted into lofts,

42:25.875 --> 42:27.375
so how can I get something better?

42:27.458 --> 42:29.625
-ENRIQUE: Come on, bro.
-But he's criticizing.

42:29.708 --> 42:33.166
Uh, look, guys,
I'm not who you think I am. Okay?

42:34.125 --> 42:35.125
Hmm.

42:35.625 --> 42:37.958
So, you are not Hawkeye?

42:39.541 --> 42:40.833
Well, I...

42:42.083 --> 42:43.333
I guess I am who you think I am.

42:44.125 --> 42:47.250
Uh, I'm not the guy you're looking for.

42:50.958 --> 42:52.458
Kate Bishop.

42:54.125 --> 42:55.708
Not Kate Bishop.

42:55.791 --> 42:57.000
Kate Bishop is guy, bro.

42:57.083 --> 42:58.500
Kate Bishop is not guy.

42:58.583 --> 43:00.708
Kate Bishop is guy in costume.

43:00.791 --> 43:02.333
Wow. Hmm.

43:04.166 --> 43:07.500
Can I speak to your manager?
This is like talking to furniture.

43:07.583 --> 43:11.541
I came here
to talk to your boss.

43:11.625 --> 43:13.083
Is that possible?

43:14.125 --> 43:15.416
I'm trying to be civil here.

43:15.500 --> 43:18.041
Civil? We kidnapped you, <i>rozumiesz?</i>

43:18.791 --> 43:21.083
-You are our hostage now, <i>rozumiesz to?</i>

43:21.166 --> 43:23.125
Well...

43:23.208 --> 43:24.541
If you like.

43:25.250 --> 43:27.500
Is that him there?
I would like to speak to your boss.

43:27.583 --> 43:28.708
-It's why I came.
-THOMAS: Hey.

43:28.791 --> 43:31.166
Look at me, okay?
Because I'm interrogating you right now.

43:31.250 --> 43:34.166
-IVAN: Bro.
-We are now interrogating you,

43:34.250 --> 43:36.166
-so look at us.
-You're the shift manager?

43:36.250 --> 43:38.000
Where is Kate Bishop?

43:38.083 --> 43:40.291
I've never met her. I have no idea.

43:40.375 --> 43:42.416
-Come on! Where is Kate Bishop?

43:42.500 --> 43:44.250
Who are you talking about?

43:52.541 --> 43:53.583
Bro, I found her.

43:55.083 --> 43:56.125
Oh, my God.

44:02.041 --> 44:04.458
Oh, wow. Didn't realize we were
supposed to bring guns.

44:11.958 --> 44:13.375
There you go.

44:13.458 --> 44:15.083
Don't worry, you will not fell off.

44:15.166 --> 44:17.000
-You got it.
-It's strong.

44:17.083 --> 44:18.250
Thank you.

44:19.083 --> 44:20.791
Look what you did.

44:20.875 --> 44:22.750
I was just trying to help, okay?

44:24.166 --> 44:25.916
-Don't talk.
-Well...

44:26.416 --> 44:29.500
Uh-oh. You're in trouble now, bro.

44:47.541 --> 44:50.208
We have them both.

44:52.791 --> 44:56.125
We have them...
