Get on the ground! Come on!

01:45.255 --> 01:48.482
Surf's up. You're going down, Sorbo.

01:53.631 --> 01:55.821
Run for your life, goober!

02:07.962 --> 02:10.273
Stop chasing me, you freak!

02:32.870 --> 02:34.694
Pardon us, ma'am.

02:41.446 --> 02:42.886
Yeah!

02:46.050 --> 02:49.541
- Keep running.
- Just parking tickets.

02:49.621 --> 02:52.482
- Come on! I'm only an actor.
- Go, dude!

02:55.793 --> 02:57.683
<i>Denny, here he comes.</i>

03:00.565 --> 03:02.747
<i>Dude, why you looking at the copter? Run!</i>

03:03.167 --> 03:04.724
Run!

03:08.673 --> 03:09.845
Booney!

03:12.210 --> 03:14.054
Welcome to Boone County.

03:27.475 --> 03:30.283
- <i>Jackson.</i>
- Already there.

03:31.516 --> 03:34.252
How did I go from hunting
Hussein to Hercules?

03:34.532 --> 03:37.855
I've done a lot of other movies and TV shows
since that was on the air, buddy.

03:37.935 --> 03:40.356
- But that was your best work.
- This sucks.

03:47.011 --> 03:48.500
<i>That hurt.</i>

03:48.580 --> 03:51.804
The only legendary journey
you're gonna be taking is...

03:52.050 --> 03:55.173
- ...your face to the floor.
- Don't make me laugh, man.

03:55.253 --> 04:00.124
- That's not funny.
- Kevin Sorbo, you just got Boone'd.

04:00.604 --> 04:02.932
America, you're welcome.

04:04.262 --> 04:06.885
<i>Overseas, he served our country.</i>

04:06.965 --> 04:09.253
Kicked ass in Baghdad.
Time to get out of here.

04:09.333 --> 04:14.326
<i>Now, he's back home, serving ass
whoopings to D-bags here in America.</i>

04:18.743 --> 04:21.833
<i>"Boone: The Bounty Hunter."</i>

04:22.213 --> 04:24.035
You just got Boone'd.

04:24.115 --> 04:26.538
America, you're welcome.

04:27.118 --> 04:30.275
- Stop!
- It's just a parking ticket! Get off me.

04:31.005 --> 04:33.545
Hey, there you go! Son of a bitch!

04:33.625 --> 04:35.147
Damn.

04:35.727 --> 04:38.551
- You guys are about to get Boone'd.
- <i>It's radical action.</i>

04:39.981 --> 04:43.155
<i>He's putting bad guys in traction.</i>

04:43.235 --> 04:45.990
- Seven unpaid parking tickets.
- What are you talking about, man?

04:46.070 --> 04:48.192
- Parking tickets.
- Dude, I live in Beverly hills.

04:48.272 --> 04:49.994
Plans are for goobers.

04:50.074 --> 04:52.532
<i>Starring... Boone.</i>

04:56.981 --> 04:59.804
- Surf's up, dirtbag.
- I got Boone'd! Yeah!

04:59.884 --> 05:02.206
<i>Also starring Denny, Jackson, and Kat.</i>

05:02.286 --> 05:04.022
Here comes the Boone.

05:07.524 --> 05:10.083
America, you're welcome.

05:14.131 --> 05:16.200
Good job, everybody. Let's finish strong.

05:16.280 --> 05:19.090
- Get up.
- You dislocated my shoulder.

05:19.570 --> 05:21.926
It's Boone from TV!

05:22.006 --> 05:23.896
Boone be the glory.

05:25.576 --> 05:27.800
- Need these?
- Yeah.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.968
- Crazy.
- Zeus would be disappointed.

05:31.048 --> 05:33.705
Stop it with the Hercules references.

05:34.185 --> 05:37.043
- Can I have your autograph?
- Hey, ladies.

05:38.121 --> 05:41.413
Autograph? I could write
a poem on these things.

05:41.743 --> 05:44.532
Amazing, just amazing.

05:45.515 --> 05:50.588
That was way, way too rough, man.
Totally unnecessary! God!

05:50.668 --> 05:54.425
Hey, hey, hey, this is gonna air before
my movie comes out next month, right?

05:54.505 --> 05:57.130
- I'm sure it will.
- Okay, good.

05:59.143 --> 06:01.199
Hercules. It's Hercules.

06:01.279 --> 06:03.434
Boone fans, your van's
waiting across the street.

06:03.514 --> 06:06.205
Come on, and don't forget
to sign your release forms.

06:12.489 --> 06:14.712
Hey, tweet me later, okay?

06:14.792 --> 06:16.350
Hashtag...

06:19.730 --> 06:21.502
You okay, foxy grandma?

06:23.634 --> 06:25.090
Yeah.

06:26.170 --> 06:29.449
Listen, if anything back there was damaged,
let me know. I'll get production to cover it.

06:29.529 --> 06:32.113
You're the bounty hunter from TV.

06:32.193 --> 06:36.334
In the flesh. And if there's anything
I can do for you, just name it.

06:36.414 --> 06:38.736
Maybe I could get an autograph.

06:38.816 --> 06:40.406
Absolutely.

06:57.835 --> 07:00.859
- Hey, wicked party, Ryan.
- You're welcome.

07:09.647 --> 07:12.136
No, no, no, no.

07:12.216 --> 07:13.571
Yes, yes, yes.

07:13.651 --> 07:17.076
- I've already had way too much.
- Oh, this is good for you.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.212
Yo, Ryan, your guy is here.

07:20.842 --> 07:23.931
Dominic, my favorite customer.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.483
Champagne?

07:25.563 --> 07:29.387
- No, wait, sorry. This one's special.
- Ryan, I didn't come to drink.

07:29.467 --> 07:31.355
You came to hang out with me?
That's so sweet.

07:31.435 --> 07:34.225
- You didn't get it again, did you?
- Wait, did you...

07:34.305 --> 07:37.629
..did you come here for...

07:38.509 --> 07:40.045
...this?

07:40.845 --> 07:43.434
There's nothing else like it.

07:43.514 --> 07:45.473
Pure, potent...

07:45.553 --> 07:48.044
...and undetectable to dogs.

07:52.156 --> 07:53.978
Not too much.

07:54.058 --> 07:56.481
My daddy makes it extra strong.

07:57.561 --> 08:00.551
Hey, that was mine, you bad girl.

08:00.631 --> 08:03.258
You know that's expensive. Don't waste it.

08:17.707 --> 08:19.571
Damn it.

08:24.555 --> 08:28.846
A couple big cases came out last night,
and we need a season finale.

08:28.926 --> 08:32.020
No more C-listers,
not unless it's for a felony.

08:32.330 --> 08:35.149
Kathy Griffin, she skipped
four counts of indecent exposure.

08:35.229 --> 08:37.456
Hey, that's a crime against humanity.

08:38.702 --> 08:42.092
So you want Boone to tackle Kathy Griffin?

08:42.173 --> 08:44.593
She'd put a better fight than Kevin Sorbo.

08:45.643 --> 08:48.432
Let's be serious, people.
Our ratings are down.

08:48.512 --> 08:51.168
We need big numbers to guarantee season six.

08:51.248 --> 08:54.138
<i>Olivia. The network is on hold for you.</i>

08:54.218 --> 08:56.676
I'll be right back. Just pick one.

08:59.656 --> 09:03.764
- Well, anything new?
- No, it's just the same crap as usual.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.354
Hey, I got something new.

09:06.964 --> 09:12.528
An RF camera with a five-mile range,
and it follows whoever wears this.

09:16.863 --> 09:19.864
- Hey. I think it likes you, Denny.
- Yeah.

09:19.944 --> 09:21.933
- All right.
- That's pretty cool.

09:22.013 --> 09:24.635
You know how our cameras
sometimes tip off the skip?

09:24.715 --> 09:28.105
Well, if we know a location beforehand,
we hide these before anyone gets there.

09:28.185 --> 09:30.775
What kinda movies you making, man?

09:30.855 --> 09:33.112
Yeah, yeah, you know you like it.

09:34.625 --> 09:36.147
Boone!

09:36.427 --> 09:37.932
Hallway.

09:38.462 --> 09:40.287
Now, please?

09:44.734 --> 09:46.625
What is it this time?

09:47.605 --> 09:49.829
Execs wanna cancel the show.

09:51.774 --> 09:53.564
They're bluffing.

09:53.644 --> 09:56.500
Just some suits trying
to score a better deal.

09:56.580 --> 10:00.471
It's real, Boone. Our numbers
are way down two years in a row.

10:00.551 --> 10:02.607
Next season will be our last.

10:07.258 --> 10:09.480
What if our last episode does huge numbers?

10:09.560 --> 10:12.049
It's not going to, Boone.
People don't care anymore.

10:12.129 --> 10:16.520
- They think this is staged.
- Well, then go back to how we started.

10:16.600 --> 10:20.191
Let's find a real bad guy. Make headlines.

10:20.271 --> 10:21.839
Boone

10:22.604 --> 10:24.420
I'm sorry.

10:40.590 --> 10:44.048
- Cage Bickle.
- <i>Hey, Colonel, what's cracking?</i>

10:44.128 --> 10:46.617
- Boone?
- Yep.

10:46.997 --> 10:49.020
- I need some help.
- Get a therapist.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.482
With a case. Remember that favor you owe me?

10:51.562 --> 10:54.925
Look, Boone, you know you're not supposed
to be calling me here at the office.

10:55.005 --> 10:57.253
- Well, if you picked up your cell...
- <i>Yeah, I know. I know.</i>

10:57.333 --> 11:00.064
I am super busy with some
monster cases, right now.

11:00.144 --> 11:03.125
- <i>Yeah, look, I get it.</i>
- In fact, my cell is ringing. Look, Boone...

11:03.205 --> 11:05.569
- ...I gotta go. I gotta take this call.
- <i>Give me two minutes.</i>

11:05.649 --> 11:09.272
I wish I could.
I'll call you back. I promise.

11:12.489 --> 11:16.445
- This is Cage.
- Hey, Colonel, long time no talk.

11:17.795 --> 11:19.850
What the hell do you want?

11:19.930 --> 11:22.112
A case, something hot.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.957
Is this for your TV show?

11:26.637 --> 11:30.279
I'm still a bounty hunter first,
the best you ever worked with.

11:34.644 --> 11:37.870
You know DEA can't be
sharing intel with civilians.

11:39.549 --> 11:43.007
I'm good at keeping secrets. You know that.

11:46.157 --> 11:48.280
And after this, we're even?

11:51.862 --> 11:53.109
What do ya got?

12:11.709 --> 12:15.040
Get in, babe.
Let's test your snorkeling skills.

12:19.323 --> 12:21.351
It feels fizzy.

12:22.926 --> 12:24.767
Taste it.

12:26.147 --> 12:29.589
Like, now you're afraid of what goes
in your mouth? Come on. Try it.

12:31.801 --> 12:34.241
Champagne infused.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.880
Costs me 12 large every time I fill it up.

12:38.741 --> 12:39.865
Ryan!

12:41.445 --> 12:45.318
Oh, damn it. Just... if he asks you
any questions, you don't speak English.

12:48.818 --> 12:50.041
Ryan!

12:50.901 --> 12:52.510
Jump on in.

12:52.590 --> 12:54.813
You, too, sexy Tessy.

12:55.393 --> 12:59.200
Did you share anything with her?

12:59.630 --> 13:01.752
Oh, a couple times.

13:01.832 --> 13:06.274
She's a grand an hour. You really think I
would waste a second talking about my dad?

13:07.504 --> 13:10.628
- You're Cole Davenport?
- Oh, come on, shut it.

13:10.708 --> 13:15.266
No, no, no. Please, I want to know
more about my son's friends.

13:15.346 --> 13:17.901
She's not a friend. She's a whore.

13:17.981 --> 13:19.370
Even better.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.405
Ryan was telling me about your new product.

13:21.485 --> 13:24.939
I have people high up in
distribution who could really...

13:25.019 --> 13:26.465
Oh, my God!

13:28.292 --> 13:32.216
Now, I have to drain the whole thing!
That's not water, dad! That's wasteful!

13:32.296 --> 13:35.950
You wanna talk about waste?
Waste is when you have a warehouse...

13:36.030 --> 13:39.823
...full of people slaving for ten months
to produce enough product...

13:39.903 --> 13:43.483
...for one massive shipment,
and then I have my son...

13:43.563 --> 13:45.997
...steal some of the product,
use it with his girlfriend...

13:46.077 --> 13:48.365
- ...and now she's dead on the floor!
- That was an accident.

13:48.445 --> 13:53.297
Well, you know what? Your accident
now has my product in her bloodstream.

13:53.377 --> 13:57.041
You know what that means?
The feds know what to look for.

13:57.121 --> 13:59.470
So I want you to get
your ass out of that pool...

13:59.550 --> 14:02.767
...because I need to go down to
the plant to speed up production...

14:02.847 --> 14:04.816
- ...and you are coming with me.
- No!

14:04.896 --> 14:08.032
I can't have you mouthing off
to the FBI. I mean...

14:08.112 --> 14:11.379
- Come on, I wouldn't rat on you, Dad.
- No...

14:12.134 --> 14:13.760
...dumbass.

14:14.337 --> 14:16.093
You never will.

14:16.173 --> 14:18.963
Tess here has invited the Cardoza brothers.

14:19.043 --> 14:21.599
I guarantee you they will take care of you.

14:21.709 --> 14:23.701
Oh, come on, I don't need babysitters.

14:23.781 --> 14:26.637
No more parties, no more whores...

14:26.717 --> 14:28.740
...no more loose ends.

14:29.253 --> 14:31.147
No more screw-ups.

14:38.161 --> 14:39.597
<i>Ryan Davenport...</i>

14:39.677 --> 14:43.554
...trust fund kid charged with the
second degree murder of Candy Charley.

14:43.634 --> 14:47.024
Cops found her body on the side of route 101
with enough rohypnol in her system...

14:47.104 --> 14:49.860
...to knock out a rhinoceros.
And... get this.

14:49.940 --> 14:52.529
They found a new designer drug
in her system, too.

14:52.609 --> 14:55.833
I'm telling you guys, we nab this weasel,
and he leads them to the snoopy sauce.

14:55.913 --> 15:00.437
- It's huge.
- Hey, Boone, this is a real case.

15:00.517 --> 15:03.640
Yeah, this isn't hog-tying Kardashians.
We're a TV show.

15:03.720 --> 15:05.853
We were a TV show.

15:07.090 --> 15:09.260
You didn't tell them?

15:09.340 --> 15:11.426
This is our last episode.

15:12.296 --> 15:14.339
- Damn.
- Not if we score massive ratings...

15:14.419 --> 15:17.321
...by Booneing a spoiled D-bag
who buys his way out of trouble.

15:17.401 --> 15:20.191
Okay, his trial starts tomorrow.
How do you even know he's gonna skip?

15:20.271 --> 15:23.100
He already did, this morning.

15:23.180 --> 15:26.197
- He left the state?
- Oh, yeah, he's a skipper.

15:26.677 --> 15:29.900
- Where you get these?
- A friend at the DEA.

15:29.980 --> 15:33.537
- So you know where he went?
- Grab your <i>margaritas, señoritas.</i>

15:33.617 --> 15:37.658
We're going to Mexico. We could be there
by morning and back by sunset.

15:37.738 --> 15:41.824
- Morning, like tomorrow morning?
- No way. We need intel on this guy...

15:41.904 --> 15:43.547
...this town. We need gear.

15:43.627 --> 15:46.317
Mexico is a stopover for this creep.
We gotta strike fast.

15:46.397 --> 15:48.652
Come on, man. You know Mexico
don't like bounty hunters.

15:48.732 --> 15:52.489
He's right. They'll let Davenport
go and charge us with abduction.

15:52.569 --> 15:56.894
We're just nicely asking the murderer
if he'll take a ride back to L.A. with us.

15:56.974 --> 16:00.030
If we get busted, which we won't,
we all know it's just a matter of <i>pesos...</i>

16:00.110 --> 16:03.334
- ...to get us out.
- We don't have a budget anymore.

16:03.414 --> 16:05.502
The bail was 10 mil.

16:05.582 --> 16:07.903
That's a million dollar bounty.

16:11.587 --> 16:14.679
We're not going, end of discussion.

16:26.769 --> 16:28.654
Yo, Boone!

16:30.908 --> 16:33.398
Never was good at following orders.

16:34.144 --> 16:37.469
- That's why you love me, right?
- Yeah, you're right, but...

16:37.549 --> 16:39.937
- ...I'm still not going.
- What?

16:40.017 --> 16:44.241
And you guys shouldn't, either.
Denny, you know this is crazy.

16:45.021 --> 16:47.768
- Boone says it's an easy score.
- Kat.

16:47.848 --> 16:51.581
Hey, since I'm out of a job,
I could use the million bucks...

16:51.661 --> 16:53.984
...and somebody needs to watch their asses.

16:54.064 --> 16:56.484
Let's grab the last of our gear, Denny.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.159
I might not be able to stop them
from following you...

17:02.239 --> 17:05.729
...but maybe I can stop you
from leading them into trouble.

17:05.809 --> 17:10.078
- Come on, man. I thought you liked trouble.
- I like my wife and my kids more.

17:10.157 --> 17:13.248
Are they the type of kids that like to eat?
Man, I'm trying to save our jobs.

17:13.328 --> 17:14.838
Maybe it's time to find new jobs.

17:14.917 --> 17:17.741
Doing what? Watching the door
at some club on Sunset?

17:17.820 --> 17:19.742
No, man, we worked too hard for too long.

17:19.823 --> 17:22.345
You think we're gonna find another gig
that pays this well to crush bad guys?

17:22.425 --> 17:24.886
- Is that what we're doing?
- Yeah.

17:24.965 --> 17:28.585
Look, you're the best soldier
I ever fought with.

17:28.665 --> 17:31.021
But, Boone, trust me on this one.

17:31.101 --> 17:33.023
You're making a huge mistake this time.

17:33.103 --> 17:36.528
Talking about going to Mexico.
You don't know that place. Think.

17:37.808 --> 17:41.088
I am thinking. I can take care of myself.

17:41.378 --> 17:44.123
You're supposed to take care
of everyone else, too.

18:26.489 --> 18:29.781
It's official. We're completely off the grid.

18:30.461 --> 18:34.651
What? Damn it. How am I supposed to
tweet this epic selfie to the Booneatics?

18:34.731 --> 18:37.223
How will the twitverse survive?

18:40.102 --> 18:43.060
You know, Kat, I've been thinking.

18:43.140 --> 18:44.963
Don't hurt yourself.

18:46.243 --> 18:49.301
We need to relieve
the sexual tension between us.

18:51.715 --> 18:54.304
When we get back to L.A., I think
you should come over to my place.

18:54.384 --> 18:57.942
We'll crack open some beers
and watch some pro wrestling.

19:01.524 --> 19:04.531
Come over. I'll show you some moves.
We could do some pilates, some yoga...

19:04.611 --> 19:07.551
- ...you know, Wednesday night stuff.
- A showmance could help the ratings.

19:07.631 --> 19:10.451
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
I'd do it to save everyone's jobs.

19:10.531 --> 19:13.952
Fine. If it'll help the show,
I'll just hook up with Denny.

19:50.573 --> 19:54.064
- Look, there are people in this town.
- Yeah, two.

19:54.644 --> 19:57.225
- Where is everybody?
- What the hell?

19:59.800 --> 20:01.806
What's this guy's story?

20:14.063 --> 20:16.320
Hey, want some water?

20:16.500 --> 20:18.557
- <i>Agua?</i>
- Yeah.

20:20.537 --> 20:21.960
No.

20:24.641 --> 20:27.865
No, take it, man. You need it.
And some lip balm.

20:27.945 --> 20:31.403
Okay, but if you get thirsty and
change your mind, it's right there.

20:35.785 --> 20:38.858
- Hey, what's the sign say?
- It means lazy.

20:40.122 --> 20:42.079
You're Boone The Hunter.

20:42.459 --> 20:45.896
See? They do know me down here.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.271
What's with him?

20:50.249 --> 20:52.176
He broke the rules.

20:55.705 --> 20:57.962
You're here to stop the bad men?

20:58.642 --> 21:01.499
That's right, one of the worst.

21:03.112 --> 21:04.969
What's your name, kid?

21:05.749 --> 21:07.338
Miguel.

21:08.418 --> 21:10.087
So, Miguel...

21:12.906 --> 21:16.348
...how would you like to be
a deputy bounty hunter?

21:21.897 --> 21:23.704
Any new gringos come to town yesterday?

21:23.784 --> 21:25.324
No.

21:26.570 --> 21:28.994
Calm down, chief. I got a card for you, too.

21:33.343 --> 21:35.717
You want <i>señor</i> Davenport.

21:49.376 --> 21:51.265
The kid said this is the place.

21:55.048 --> 21:58.089
Camera one online and recording.

21:58.669 --> 22:00.657
Come on. Let's be ready to rock.

22:00.737 --> 22:02.613
Boone cam...

22:03.066 --> 22:06.513
- ...set.
- Boone cam check.

22:07.163 --> 22:08.678
Gross.

22:09.091 --> 22:12.317
- Got Denny cam.
- Denny cam check.

22:14.217 --> 22:16.593
- Grosser.
- Can you give me some levels?

22:16.673 --> 22:19.743
Ryan Davenport, the weatherman's
predicting hail in your future...

22:19.823 --> 22:22.746
...because I'm about to come at ya
like a bag of quarters in a strip club.

22:22.826 --> 22:26.022
Perfect. Kat cam is hot.
We've got the remotes.

22:26.102 --> 22:29.786
Just remember we gotta stay half a mile
from the van so we can record the feeds.

22:29.866 --> 22:31.423
Incoming.

22:41.331 --> 22:43.768
Yahtzee. We got him.

22:46.183 --> 22:48.040
How do we handle them?

22:49.220 --> 22:53.764
Looks like these guys found a buy one,
get one free sale on polyester goon suits.

22:53.844 --> 22:55.714
Denny can take 'em.

22:59.813 --> 23:03.350
Hey, look... he's ditching
his bodyguards. Now is our chance.

23:03.430 --> 23:06.121
- Wait, wait, hold up a sec, kittycat.
- What?

23:06.937 --> 23:09.593
- Boone, let's go.
- We can cut him off before they catch up.

23:09.673 --> 23:11.929
Davenport's still in the bar.

23:12.809 --> 23:15.599
Kid went in wearing Lucchese boots
worth at least 11 thou.

23:15.679 --> 23:18.759
The guy that came out was in sneakers.

23:19.549 --> 23:22.492
I guess being a fashion diva has its perks.

23:22.572 --> 23:24.176
Yep.

23:27.023 --> 23:30.335
Let's go Boone this chump stain.
Boone voyage, Ryan Davenport.

23:30.415 --> 23:32.148
- Group Boone.
- Let's Boone him.

23:32.228 --> 23:35.252
All right, guys. Settle down
on the Boone-Boone phrases.

23:35.332 --> 23:38.022
I'm gonna Boone this kid into next Tuesday.

23:54.985 --> 23:57.841
Denny, you thinking what I'm thinking?

23:58.521 --> 24:00.763
Probably not as advanced.

24:02.524 --> 24:05.482
You two set the cameras.
I'll probe her for information.

24:05.562 --> 24:07.550
At least that won't take too long.

24:07.630 --> 24:10.555
Well, hello, muscles.

24:12.435 --> 24:15.577
Is it hot in here, or is it just you?

24:16.673 --> 24:21.595
What can I do for you?
And remember, I can do everything.

24:21.675 --> 24:25.101
- I'm looking for somebody.
- Oh, perfect. I'm a somebody.

24:25.181 --> 24:27.537
What type of place is this anyway?

24:27.617 --> 24:30.074
The kind where you don't ask questions.

24:31.554 --> 24:33.269
Where's Ryan Davenport?

24:35.658 --> 24:37.518
See, that's a question...

24:38.428 --> 24:41.285
...and here's the only answer
that matters in this town.

24:41.765 --> 24:44.257
Don't mess with anyone named Davenport.

24:59.249 --> 25:03.139
Margarita, blended,
half sugar, half salt on the rim.

25:03.219 --> 25:06.710
Interesting place, homey.
What's going on? Fiesta? Rodeo?

25:06.790 --> 25:09.480
<i>Chicas</i> back there, dudes with hats?

25:09.960 --> 25:11.782
<i>Hablo ingles?</i>

25:12.412 --> 25:15.103
No? Okay.

25:17.934 --> 25:19.791
What's up with your face?

25:31.248 --> 25:33.504
My name is Boone: The Bounty Hunter.

25:33.884 --> 25:36.925
I'm looking for a piece of trash
named Ryan Davenport.

25:41.458 --> 25:43.481
You know where Ryan is, chief?

25:51.434 --> 25:53.256
<i>Thirsty, huh?</i>

25:53.636 --> 25:55.493
This round is on me.

25:56.473 --> 25:59.596
Speak English? Do you know where Ryan is?

25:59.676 --> 26:02.244
I don't think so, brother.

26:03.346 --> 26:05.837
- You don't think so.
- Yeah.

26:07.717 --> 26:09.341
He doesn't think so.

26:14.074 --> 26:15.727
Okay, then.

26:43.700 --> 26:46.177
A-Boone-a-matata, goober.

26:52.228 --> 26:54.132
I had him!

27:03.573 --> 27:06.430
- Where's Ryan?
- Upstairs.

27:07.110 --> 27:10.169
- Where's the stairs?
- Over there.

27:24.943 --> 27:27.951
Hello, Ryan, ladies.

27:28.831 --> 27:31.388
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm the trash collector.

27:31.668 --> 27:35.358
- Do you have any idea who I am?
- Yeah, you're the trash.

27:35.438 --> 27:37.660
I'm guessing you haven't seen my show.

27:39.108 --> 27:41.013
The bad guys always run.

27:46.417 --> 27:49.706
- I'm keeping the chipotle card.
- I'll go get the van.

27:53.990 --> 27:56.012
Good job, Boone.

27:56.092 --> 27:59.482
- I'm gonna cuff him.
- No, no, no. This is our season finale.

27:59.562 --> 28:02.085
We still gotta Boone the crap
out of the roofie kid here.

28:02.165 --> 28:05.788
- <i>I think we're gonna win an Emmy for this.</i>
- I don't know. He doesn't look so good.

28:05.868 --> 28:08.127
He's okay. Yep, yep. See? See?

28:08.207 --> 28:10.860
What about the police?
Maybe we should just drive.

28:10.940 --> 28:13.197
You guys drive. I'll run.

28:23.453 --> 28:26.217
Here comes justice, Davenprick.

28:31.461 --> 28:32.984
Yeah!

28:34.414 --> 28:36.640
Hey, man! Is that all you got?

28:37.200 --> 28:38.850
That looks fun.

28:42.372 --> 28:45.695
I haven't seen a man like that
around here in ten years.

28:45.775 --> 28:48.665
A man without a brain? A man
who doesn't know he's already dead?

28:48.745 --> 28:51.701
- He ain't your savior, Sylvia.
- Damn it, Walker.

28:51.781 --> 28:54.697
Cole Davenport takes everything from us.

28:54.777 --> 28:58.041
- Haven't you had enough?
- No, and you wanna know why?

28:58.121 --> 28:59.666
Why?

28:59.746 --> 29:01.984
Because I don't start fights I can't win.

29:10.900 --> 29:13.324
Boone-a-gram for Ryan Davenport.

29:28.151 --> 29:29.741
Yeah!

29:42.098 --> 29:44.188
You're gonna get Boone'd.

29:53.310 --> 29:55.950
Ryan Davenport, you just got Boone'd.

29:59.100 --> 30:01.904
America, you're welcome.

30:05.688 --> 30:07.929
Okay. We gotta get out of here.

30:10.356 --> 30:11.966
Hands up!

30:15.964 --> 30:18.321
Bad things... bad things are happening.

30:18.401 --> 30:21.157
- How many cops are there?
- Forget it, Boone. We can't assault officers.

30:21.237 --> 30:23.838
Just get Ryan out of here.

30:25.108 --> 30:27.531
Boone, just hide. Just hide. They're coming.

30:42.842 --> 30:46.549
Don't get negative. Stay positive,
okay? Glass is half full.

30:46.629 --> 30:50.019
<i>Worst case scenario,
you go to jail for a few days.</i>

30:50.099 --> 30:52.908
I don't think that's the worst case scenario.

30:52.988 --> 30:56.413
Remember that guy on the street?
He was just being lazy.

30:58.474 --> 31:01.297
I'm gonna take the Davenport kid
across the border, cash in the bounty.

31:01.377 --> 31:04.600
- You're gonna go home without us?
- <i>We'll have a million bucks to get you out.</i>

31:04.680 --> 31:07.237
Tell them that. Tell them you can pay.

31:07.317 --> 31:09.941
- <i>Fuera</i>, out.
- Yeah, sorry.

31:38.647 --> 31:41.537
- Mr. Victor.
- Mr. Davenport, how are you?

31:41.617 --> 31:43.740
So you finally did something
I told you to do, huh?

31:43.820 --> 31:46.209
You gave 'em extra food
and water. That's good.

31:46.289 --> 31:48.679
- And everybody is very appreciative, sir.
- Yeah, they are?

31:48.759 --> 31:51.614
Well, why the hell
are we behind schedule, Victor?

31:51.694 --> 31:54.050
- The crew, they're working around the clock.
- Yeah?

31:54.130 --> 31:57.454
- And there's nothing more we can do.
- Yeah? Okay. All right, you say...

31:57.534 --> 32:00.289
No, you touch him, I'll knock you out.

32:00.369 --> 32:02.925
- But he's very sick.
- Yeah, he's sick.

32:03.005 --> 32:05.795
Everybody is sick. Look at him.

32:05.875 --> 32:08.765
If we treat one of 'em,
we have to treat all of 'em.

32:08.845 --> 32:12.535
Do you understand that? They'll stop
working. Then what do we have, huh?

32:12.615 --> 32:16.306
I want you to keep him there,
so everybody can see as an example.

32:16.386 --> 32:20.403
People, tomorrow we go home,
but tonight we finish.

32:21.090 --> 32:23.715
I said send the car.

32:26.762 --> 32:27.850
- What is it?
- It's Ryan.

32:27.930 --> 32:29.952
- It's Ryan, again?
- Again.

32:30.032 --> 32:31.715
Victor!

32:33.435 --> 32:35.260
Leave him alone.

32:51.053 --> 32:53.976
This supposed to be a chokehold?
Because I really shouldn't be able to talk.

32:54.056 --> 32:56.246
Let me go, or I'll kill you.

32:56.326 --> 32:58.616
Let me know when I'm dead.

33:01.497 --> 33:03.325
Helicopter ride.

33:08.338 --> 33:12.225
You better not have just gave me rabies,
or I'll drag you all the way to the border.

33:13.976 --> 33:16.232
Nice escape, monkey nuts.

33:16.412 --> 33:18.601
All right, stop screwing around.

33:18.681 --> 33:20.636
Time to get up and walk, you little D-bag.

33:20.716 --> 33:26.509
You really don't get it. My dad owns
this whole town, including the cops.

33:26.589 --> 33:31.282
Your friends, they're dead,
dead unless you take me back, now!

33:34.729 --> 33:37.086
It's 300 miles to the border, moron.

33:37.166 --> 33:40.024
You really think you're gonna
carry me the whole way?

33:51.347 --> 33:53.269
Smells like hell.

33:53.349 --> 33:55.188
You might as well get used to it.

33:56.068 --> 33:58.124
No point in wearing your voice out.

33:58.604 --> 34:00.694
No tracks out here but ours, so...

34:03.946 --> 34:06.018
Yeah, I'll miss you, too.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.628
Perfect place for a little turd.

34:28.583 --> 34:32.860
Oh, God. Oh, this was so dumb...

34:32.940 --> 34:36.585
...but I love... I love how Boone
manages to get out just fine.

34:36.926 --> 34:39.583
Yeah. Think he's all right?

34:47.369 --> 34:50.344
I am <i>Comandante Muñoz.</i>

34:50.425 --> 34:52.244
Are you both okay?

34:53.309 --> 34:55.063
Yeah, I think we're all right.

34:55.143 --> 34:58.035
I'm sorry that we don't have
nicer accommodations.

34:59.605 --> 35:01.871
Hopefully, we'll clear this up quickly.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.189
Thank you.

35:04.419 --> 35:08.077
I... I think there's been a misunderstanding.

35:08.157 --> 35:11.614
You see, our friend, Ryan Davenport,
he invited us down here...

35:11.694 --> 35:14.123
- ...but now they're saying...
- Don't lie...

35:15.007 --> 35:16.819
...Miss Sanders.

35:17.099 --> 35:21.491
I have seen your television show.
I actually enjoy it very much.

35:21.571 --> 35:24.360
Well, then you know the man
we're pursuing was to go on trial today...

35:24.440 --> 35:26.252
...for murdering a young woman.

35:30.846 --> 35:32.704
Check on this story.

35:34.817 --> 35:36.907
I find this very troubling.

35:37.787 --> 35:40.822
If true, we will pursue his extradition...

35:40.990 --> 35:44.013
...but it must be done
through Mexican authorities...

35:44.293 --> 35:48.918
...and to do that, we must bring
Ryan in before anyone is hurt.

35:48.998 --> 35:51.620
Perhaps, with your technology...

35:52.000 --> 35:55.071
...you might be able to contact
or locate your friend.

35:56.706 --> 35:59.896
You know, if he's still wearing
his transmitter, I can find him.

35:59.976 --> 36:02.845
I'll just need my laptop from the van.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.672
I'll see what I can do.

36:10.218 --> 36:12.453
- Denny, he's lying.
- I know.

36:15.423 --> 36:18.257
Maybe he'll keep playing nice
if he thinks we're helping.

36:41.951 --> 36:44.393
Yes, punch buggy Boone.

36:52.514 --> 36:55.386
How am I the only one that
doesn't know how to hotwire a car?

36:59.869 --> 37:01.760
Boone yeah.

37:04.005 --> 37:05.830
Come on.

37:16.819 --> 37:19.477
There's your problem. No engine.

37:28.748 --> 37:30.016
That's a nice truck.

38:14.409 --> 38:16.900
Milli, Vanilli.

38:18.213 --> 38:21.973
This is gonna be sick.
I just wish they had the cameras here.

39:13.452 --> 39:15.208
Oh, <i>no bueno.</i>

39:16.008 --> 39:18.027
Where is Ryan?

39:18.107 --> 39:19.956
He's in the crapper.

39:31.552 --> 39:33.110
Hey.

39:35.207 --> 39:38.850
Okay. Okay, let's talk, guys.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.444
Let go of my vest!

39:59.831 --> 40:03.305
Officers! Hey, hey, okay.

40:03.385 --> 40:05.306
I'm actually glad you're here.

40:18.499 --> 40:20.823
What are you doing? Don't kill him.

40:20.903 --> 40:22.843
We need him to find Ryan.

40:26.375 --> 40:28.632
Only way you can follow me is on Twitter.

40:56.137 --> 40:58.230
You better hope we find this kid.

41:04.846 --> 41:08.471
Okay, I should be able
to pinpoint his transmitter...

41:09.201 --> 41:12.858
...but I'm gonna have to remote the signal
through our office in Los Angeles, and...

41:14.138 --> 41:17.630
...that means I'm gonna have to give
my producer a call to grant access.

41:18.060 --> 41:19.600
Okay.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.376
We'll call later.

41:31.006 --> 41:33.262
- Okay.
- There's some new plans.

41:33.342 --> 41:36.166
- Come on. Let's talk.
- Sure.

41:41.116 --> 41:44.441
I got some good news and some bad news.

41:46.654 --> 41:48.696
Let's go! Let's go!

41:51.277 --> 41:53.083
Back in the cell!

42:03.322 --> 42:05.154
Sit down!

42:08.809 --> 42:11.048
See something you like?

42:16.918 --> 42:19.794
You'll be so beautiful when you're dead.

42:29.331 --> 42:33.783
As the <i>Comandante</i> was saying,
there is good news and there is bad news.

42:34.303 --> 42:38.128
- Preference?
- First starting with bad.

42:39.308 --> 42:42.365
I'm afraid that your friend, Boone...

42:42.945 --> 42:44.768
...is dead.

42:46.448 --> 42:48.337
I'm sorry.

42:48.417 --> 42:50.874
I made a terrible mistake.

42:52.054 --> 42:54.277
That was the good news.

42:55.491 --> 42:57.813
The bad news is...

42:57.893 --> 43:00.616
...they haven't found my son...

43:00.696 --> 43:05.732
...and that's especially bad for you
because we don't need you anymore.

43:07.606 --> 43:09.099
You're done.

43:09.939 --> 43:11.761
What about Jackson?

43:12.141 --> 43:13.706
Jackson?

43:16.611 --> 43:18.767
He must have gotten away with Ryan.

43:18.847 --> 43:20.769
- Jackson?
- I've seen their show.

43:20.849 --> 43:24.307
- There's usually another.
- Let us call Jackson.

43:24.987 --> 43:26.809
We can arrange a trade...

43:27.489 --> 43:29.374
...us for Ryan.

43:30.329 --> 43:31.955
You do that.

43:34.612 --> 43:37.251
Tess, come on!

43:42.143 --> 43:44.996
When they find Ryan, we're dead.

44:04.358 --> 44:06.592
Help! Help!

44:06.672 --> 44:09.186
Help! Help!

44:09.266 --> 44:11.122
Help!

44:24.879 --> 44:27.706
Boone? Boone?

44:39.895 --> 44:41.786
Oh, you're okay.

44:48.503 --> 44:51.560
<i>America. Sleep with your lights on.</i>

44:51.640 --> 44:54.665
<i>This ain't Flipper. This is Jaws.</i>

44:56.545 --> 44:58.300
I smell tacos.

44:58.380 --> 45:01.038
<i>Boone! Boone! I see him! I see him!</i>

45:06.522 --> 45:08.643
- <i>Come on.</i>
- <i>You're in big trouble, Tiny.</i>

45:08.723 --> 45:11.780
<i>Boone, I'm about to serve you up
a piece of humble pie.</i>

45:11.860 --> 45:14.103
<i>I hope you're hungry for some rocky road...</i>

45:14.183 --> 45:17.588
<i>...'cause this marshmallow is about
to kick some chocolate nuts.</i>

45:22.371 --> 45:24.642
<i>This one's called a ghetto massage.</i>

45:31.980 --> 45:35.170
- You like that, huh?
- <i>Señor</i> Boone!

45:35.250 --> 45:37.305
They call that the Boone special.

45:39.688 --> 45:41.977
- You did this?
- My dad.

45:42.057 --> 45:44.211
He's the best doctor in town.

45:46.161 --> 45:49.384
- You're awake.
- Yeah.

45:49.464 --> 45:51.553
Thanks for patching me up, doc.

45:51.633 --> 45:53.422
You're very lucky.

45:53.502 --> 45:55.891
The bullet hit something on your vest.

45:55.971 --> 45:57.483
Here.

46:01.106 --> 46:02.645
That's what I call a great headshot.

46:02.765 --> 46:07.963
Seems like Miguelito was following you
today, fortunately for you.

46:08.043 --> 46:09.906
Nice work, deputy.

46:10.886 --> 46:13.895
You've been unconscious
for about three hours now.

46:16.725 --> 46:18.485
- I need to go.
- No, no, no.

46:18.565 --> 46:22.464
You need to eat, all right?
One moment. I'll be right back.

46:24.866 --> 46:28.290
Hey, Miguel. Are there any phones in town?

46:28.370 --> 46:32.494
Not many. San Borracho, <i>señor</i> Davenport's.

46:32.574 --> 46:34.723
I know they're at the police station.

46:34.803 --> 46:36.696
And that one.

46:41.082 --> 46:42.971
Boone: The Bounty Hunter.

46:43.051 --> 46:45.914
Boone! Where the hell are you?

47:05.840 --> 47:10.028
Hey, look. I'll be out of here any minute,
okay? My producer is gonna call back...

47:10.108 --> 47:12.319
- ...and then I'm gone.
- Okay.

47:12.799 --> 47:14.839
How much for that old pickup?

47:18.620 --> 47:21.510
Name your price. My producer
can wire money within the hour.

47:21.590 --> 47:23.879
If they catch you in my truck,
they'll know we helped you.

47:23.959 --> 47:26.048
Then all your money will mean nothing.

47:26.928 --> 47:28.419
Excuse me.

47:31.483 --> 47:33.186
You can use my bike.

47:35.036 --> 47:36.880
Thanks, deputy.

47:38.006 --> 47:40.665
Two hundred miles of seat rash
might be the way to go.

47:43.311 --> 47:45.568
Your mom is not really a Boone fan, is she?

47:46.048 --> 47:49.294
She doesn't understand
that you're here to save us.

47:49.818 --> 47:52.242
Here, take these.

47:54.554 --> 47:58.198
If you're gonna be a bounty hunter,
you should start looking the part.

48:03.263 --> 48:06.688
Hey, kid, thanks for everything.

48:06.968 --> 48:10.860
Your parents are good people.
You should listen to 'em, okay?

48:11.840 --> 48:14.763
And... and... at school...

48:14.843 --> 48:17.599
...if someone offers you drugs,
don't do drugs...

48:17.679 --> 48:22.187
...'cause drugs can hurt your brain
development. It's not good for you.

48:22.267 --> 48:26.065
It's gonna get in the way of doing what you
wanna do, get in the way of your dreams.

48:26.145 --> 48:29.611
And if you have a dream, you gotta follow
your dreams and don't take no for an answer.

48:29.691 --> 48:34.638
Unless you're with a <i>señorita</i>,
and, in that case, no means no.

48:35.630 --> 48:38.021
And when you're out in the desert,
if it's windy...

48:38.101 --> 48:40.722
...you don't pee into the wind, because
you never wanna pee in the wind.

48:40.802 --> 48:42.847
You don't wanna pee on yourself at all.
You know, that's gross.

48:42.927 --> 48:45.360
Unless you get stung by a jellyfish.

48:45.440 --> 48:48.163
In that case, you could pee on yourself
'cause that's what you should do.

48:48.243 --> 48:51.234
I think that works for dog bites, also.

48:52.114 --> 48:56.004
But if you're walking around with pee on
your pants, people aren't gonna like that...

48:56.084 --> 48:58.551
...and it happened to me once 'cause...

49:00.921 --> 49:02.751
No, no.

49:04.042 --> 49:05.581
<i>Bueno.</i>

49:07.846 --> 49:09.703
Hold, please.

49:12.366 --> 49:15.824
- What's going on?
- They're not there, Boone.

49:15.904 --> 49:19.628
- The local authorities don't have them.
- They let them go.

49:20.108 --> 49:23.665
No. They're saying that Kat
and Denny were never in custody.

49:23.745 --> 49:26.228
- They're denying ever having seen them.
- Then you got the wrong town.

49:26.308 --> 49:29.738
Right town! And, Boone,
they're looking for you.

49:30.918 --> 49:33.641
Something about a bar fight this morning.

49:33.721 --> 49:36.945
Yeah. It was pretty wicked.

49:37.025 --> 49:40.381
Boone, Kat and Denny are in Mexican prison...

49:40.461 --> 49:43.111
...and the federales are denying
ever having seen them.

49:43.191 --> 49:45.554
- <i>They could be hurt or in danger.</i>
- Olivia! Olivia! Relax, okay?

49:45.634 --> 49:47.422
- Have you tried throwing money at this?
- Of course I have!

49:47.502 --> 49:50.999
Throw more. Fricking catapult cash at this.
You're gonna have a million extra bucks soon.

49:51.079 --> 49:52.612
Boone...

49:52.692 --> 49:55.171
...I told you not to go.

49:57.111 --> 49:59.734
- Maybe we should call the feds.
- To do what?

49:59.814 --> 50:02.036
- Invade Mexico?
- To put pressure on, you know?

50:02.116 --> 50:04.773
- If the cops have Kat and Denny, then...
- They'll just deny it!

50:04.853 --> 50:09.244
They can't deny it, okay? They can't.
The whole thing was caught on tape.

50:09.324 --> 50:11.020
You have the footage?

50:12.908 --> 50:14.919
It's on Denny's computer.

50:17.648 --> 50:19.855
I don't believe it's true, Mr. Davenport.

50:20.435 --> 50:22.779
No one at San Borracho saw a fourth man.

50:23.939 --> 50:26.414
I don't know who's calling the Americans...

50:27.275 --> 50:31.266
- ...but I will find out.
- It's Boone. He must be calling.

50:31.346 --> 50:34.812
Even if it was him,
we can't depend on him, Denny.

50:37.117 --> 50:38.407
Hey, what's happening?

50:38.487 --> 50:42.718
I'm tired of these games you're playing,
Miss Sanders. It's time for the truth.

50:42.798 --> 50:45.346
- Please, stop.
- You, come out.

50:45.426 --> 50:49.850
No, no. No, no, no. You need...
you need us. You need us to get Ryan.

50:51.332 --> 50:56.158
All right, we... we can fix this.
You don't have to hurt me, all right?

50:56.738 --> 50:58.153
Look, I...

50:59.078 --> 51:01.530
Come on. Look, I can tell you...

51:01.610 --> 51:04.467
I can tell you where they are, all right?

51:05.979 --> 51:07.122
Kat!

51:28.235 --> 51:30.269
Kat, you okay?

52:50.051 --> 52:51.940
Come on.

52:52.120 --> 52:53.575
Cables...

52:54.317 --> 52:56.356
...dry stuff.

52:57.041 --> 52:59.282
Why did we bring this big-ass light?

53:01.862 --> 53:03.686
Damn it.

53:06.267 --> 53:08.724
- Guys.
- Boone.

53:09.904 --> 53:13.562
- Kat, you gonna put the gun down?
- I'm still deciding.

53:14.142 --> 53:16.731
- He came back for us, Kat.
- He came back for the van.

53:16.811 --> 53:20.237
- No, just prepping the getaway vehicle.
- Give me the keys.

53:22.617 --> 53:24.122
Wait.

53:24.202 --> 53:25.801
What are you doing in there?

53:26.221 --> 53:29.598
- I was looking for the...
- You looking for this?

53:29.908 --> 53:33.749
Yes, yes, and Denny saves the show.

53:34.829 --> 53:36.918
That's why you came back.

53:36.998 --> 53:39.054
What? No. I knew you guys would both be okay.

53:39.134 --> 53:40.612
You jackass.

53:43.304 --> 53:46.549
- Get in the van, Denny.
- We almost died today...

53:47.576 --> 53:50.233
...and nothing else
should have mattered to you!

53:54.849 --> 53:56.910
Get in the van, you guys.

54:05.727 --> 54:07.649
- Is he alive?
- He's in shock.

54:07.729 --> 54:11.353
Soaked the shoulder.
Nothing vital, but it's a gusher.

54:12.133 --> 54:14.191
He won't last long like that.

54:16.737 --> 54:19.160
<i>Boone: The Bounty Hunter.</i>

54:20.340 --> 54:22.485
<i>You're not gonna Boone me!</i>

54:26.381 --> 54:29.172
<i>Schlesinger, you just got Booned.</i>

54:34.289 --> 54:38.162
- Where is he?
- Who? Who? It's just us.

54:38.242 --> 54:41.884
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?
- We know he called from this number!

54:45.265 --> 54:49.686
He broke in. Tried to kill us.
I swear. You have to protect us.

54:50.505 --> 54:54.964
He said if we said anything at all to
anyone, he would come back for our son.

54:57.294 --> 55:01.754
<i>You just got Boone'd.
America, you're welcome.</i>

55:09.190 --> 55:11.913
Their bullet pierced through the
cooling hose. It should be an easy fix.

55:11.993 --> 55:14.082
- And our other patient?
- We have to stop the bleeding.

55:14.162 --> 55:16.418
- I'll have to stitch him up.
- How long to do both?

55:16.498 --> 55:20.418
- I don't know, 20, maybe 30 minutes.
- Way to go, bro. We did it.

55:20.498 --> 55:23.141
Did what? Almost die?

55:23.271 --> 55:27.796
We're back together. I mean, Denny's got
a cool new scar to attract the babes.

55:27.876 --> 55:30.865
We still have footage for a killer show.
We need to pick up the ending and go home.

55:30.945 --> 55:31.966
The ending?

55:32.046 --> 55:34.934
I got the Davenport kid stashed in a crapper
south of town. We'll pick him up...

55:35.014 --> 55:39.782
Stop, okay? Do you see any cameras,
Boone? Just turn it off. Stop being this.

55:40.554 --> 55:43.845
- We're not getting Ryan Davenport.
- I'm trying to save everyone's jobs, okay?

55:43.925 --> 55:48.082
You just said 20 or 30 minutes. I mean,
I'll get Ryan. You fix Denny and the van.

55:48.162 --> 55:50.084
This could be a good thing.
Don't get negative.

55:50.164 --> 55:54.088
- The glass isn't always half full, Boone.
- Hey, my glass is always half full.

55:54.168 --> 55:57.130
Even when it's all the way full,
it's at half full.

55:58.439 --> 56:00.497
I'm getting Davenport.

56:02.409 --> 56:04.133
I quit.

56:04.913 --> 56:06.424
I quit, too.

56:08.850 --> 56:11.856
You picked a bad time to wake up.
This is gonna hurt like hell.

56:12.186 --> 56:14.075
Just do it fast.

56:14.155 --> 56:17.478
- Here, I'll hold him down.
- Don't touch me, Boone.

56:17.558 --> 56:19.114
Just go away.

56:19.194 --> 56:21.683
Fine, I'll get back to L.A. on my own.

56:22.363 --> 56:24.354
A million bucks says I get there first.

56:53.293 --> 56:56.017
Oh, God. What are you doing here?

56:56.097 --> 56:57.986
I need a ride.

56:58.066 --> 57:00.122
And then I need to borrow your car.

57:01.302 --> 57:02.824
Leave.

57:03.204 --> 57:06.227
- Are you okay?
- You have no idea what you've done.

57:06.307 --> 57:09.797
- They're all here. You've got to go.
- Who? Davenport's men?

57:09.877 --> 57:12.719
No. Wait, wait, no.

57:32.199 --> 57:33.779
Pedro.

57:35.536 --> 57:36.777
You!

57:40.541 --> 57:43.915
They... they come for you.

57:44.245 --> 57:46.261
They said we help you.

57:46.341 --> 57:49.155
They... they have taken Miguelito.

57:50.919 --> 57:54.242
Why? Why? Why you do this?

57:54.322 --> 57:56.177
I can help.

57:56.957 --> 58:00.616
- I can fix this! I can fix this.
- Damn it, Walker, do something.

58:04.766 --> 58:06.622
Come on!

58:08.642 --> 58:10.063
Wait!

58:41.569 --> 58:43.409
What was that?

58:47.308 --> 58:50.216
It's Boone. He's back at the bar.

59:04.758 --> 59:08.316
- I think you better leave.
- You're letting him go?

59:08.396 --> 59:10.652
He'll live with his regrets...

59:11.132 --> 59:13.010
...just like the rest of us.

59:15.902 --> 59:18.569
No. I'm getting Miguel.

59:18.649 --> 59:21.262
Miguel? Is that the kid?

59:21.342 --> 59:22.991
Oh, my God.

59:23.311 --> 59:24.499
How?

59:25.229 --> 59:27.468
I have something Davenport wants.

59:27.548 --> 59:29.404
I have his son.

59:29.584 --> 59:33.008
Davenport will never let you
and that boy out alive.

59:33.888 --> 59:35.745
Then just Miguel.

59:41.896 --> 59:44.754
You and your friends should have never come.

59:46.700 --> 59:48.523
My friends aren't a part of this.

59:48.903 --> 59:51.293
<i>They didn't do anything wrong
except trust me.</i>

59:52.473 --> 59:54.485
I should have trusted them.

59:55.209 --> 59:58.599
So you're attacking Davenport all alone.

59:58.679 --> 01:00:01.704
If I have to, yeah.

01:00:03.944 --> 01:00:05.974
I wanna do something right.

01:00:07.024 --> 01:00:12.066
Cole Davenport running this town is about
as wrong as that spelling of liquor.

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:17.770
It just ain't right.

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:24.530
Wait.

01:00:27.375 --> 01:00:31.780
For 13 years, I've been telling myself
the best way to stay alive is to do nothing.

01:00:33.247 --> 01:00:36.057
How many have we watched suffer and die...

01:00:36.137 --> 01:00:39.375
...so that we can tell ourselves
that this is living?

01:00:43.657 --> 01:00:45.482
I'm with ya.

01:00:48.463 --> 01:00:50.308
Us, too.

01:00:51.332 --> 01:00:53.156
Yeah, somebody's gotta watch your back.

01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:58.827
Well, bounty hunter, you got us.

01:01:00.007 --> 01:01:02.053
What do you want us to do?

01:01:02.343 --> 01:01:05.221
Let's just hope turd junior
is where I left him.

01:01:08.783 --> 01:01:11.874
Oh, yes, bubbles.

01:01:14.487 --> 01:01:17.129
Bubbles, bubbles.

01:01:31.004 --> 01:01:35.429
Hey, hey, hey! It's me,
Ryan Davenport! Let me out!

01:01:35.509 --> 01:01:38.099
I'll give you $10,000 if you just let me out!

01:01:38.179 --> 01:01:40.669
That's like a billion pesos!

01:01:41.449 --> 01:01:45.573
Ten thou? I got leather pants
that cost more than that.

01:01:45.653 --> 01:01:47.143
Shit!

01:02:01.902 --> 01:02:04.158
The van has entered the site perimeter.

01:02:04.238 --> 01:02:06.095
Grab the kid.

01:02:23.556 --> 01:02:25.713
- You stink so bad.
- Hilarious.

01:02:25.793 --> 01:02:28.084
Enjoy your last few minutes of life.

01:02:36.704 --> 01:02:38.426
Let the kid go.

01:02:38.506 --> 01:02:41.529
As soon as he clears the horizon,
you can have back Ryan.

01:02:41.609 --> 01:02:43.426
I like the boy.

01:02:45.296 --> 01:02:47.146
I don't think so.

01:02:48.549 --> 01:02:51.872
The only way you're getting your son
back is if you let the kid go.

01:02:51.952 --> 01:02:54.208
I don't want him back.

01:02:54.288 --> 01:02:57.579
- What?
- Well, that plan didn't last long.

01:02:58.059 --> 01:03:00.164
- What do you wanna do?
- <i>Phase two.</i>

01:03:00.244 --> 01:03:02.216
<i>Walker and his guys aren't in position yet.</i>

01:03:02.296 --> 01:03:03.885
Improvise.

01:03:04.865 --> 01:03:07.122
Okay, just give me 30 seconds.

01:03:07.902 --> 01:03:10.124
Dad, come on. Dad, shoot him!

01:03:10.604 --> 01:03:14.395
- You're bluffing.
- You don't get it, jungle boy.

01:03:14.475 --> 01:03:18.966
None of you, including my son,
will ever go back to the United States.

01:03:19.046 --> 01:03:20.768
They're all yours.

01:03:20.848 --> 01:03:23.473
Have fun with it. Come on.

01:03:28.989 --> 01:03:30.678
What is that?

01:03:30.758 --> 01:03:32.381
There.

01:03:39.153 --> 01:03:41.822
- What is that?
- <i>Move, move! Now, now!</i>

01:03:41.902 --> 01:03:43.709
All right, you better get out of the way!

01:03:52.062 --> 01:03:53.624
Run!

01:04:06.978 --> 01:04:08.684
He's on the side of the main building.

01:04:29.817 --> 01:04:31.673
You good?

01:04:34.501 --> 01:04:36.626
Boom, there it is.

01:04:51.971 --> 01:04:54.662
Come on, folks. Move, move, move, let's go!

01:04:54.742 --> 01:04:57.365
Boone, we got your back, man. Get the kid.

01:04:58.045 --> 01:05:00.334
- Denny, a little help?
- All right, I'm on their network.

01:05:00.414 --> 01:05:02.571
Security feed is coming on now.

01:05:07.087 --> 01:05:10.146
Denny, did Davenport
get these guys on Craig's list?

01:05:15.662 --> 01:05:17.787
And there we go.

01:05:20.066 --> 01:05:23.093
I got ya. Boone, duck!

01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:28.731
- <i>Where to?</i>
- Stand by.

01:05:29.943 --> 01:05:33.602
There you are. They're heading up.
Davenport's got Miguel in the stairway.

01:05:51.899 --> 01:05:55.344
- <i>What now?</i>
- Down this hallway. To your right.

01:06:06.414 --> 01:06:08.738
You should never pull
a knife in a Boone fight.

01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:32.693
- Boone, get Miguel.
- You can't take her yourself.

01:06:32.773 --> 01:06:34.796
We've met. She's not that good.

01:06:35.976 --> 01:06:38.000
Damn, I wish I could watch this.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.305
You ready?

01:07:06.906 --> 01:07:10.765
To the roof. They're going to the helipad.
Boone, turn left here.

01:07:11.345 --> 01:07:13.768
Now, at the end of the hallway,
there's gonna be a packing room.

01:07:13.848 --> 01:07:16.420
<i>Go through it. Find the stairway.
Go all the way up.</i>

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.340
Copy that.

01:07:34.301 --> 01:07:35.725
I don't have time for this.

01:08:23.817 --> 01:08:27.843
Dad, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
It's me. Wait, Dad! Dad.

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:35.020
Dad! Dad?

01:09:11.964 --> 01:09:13.823
Get over here!

01:09:14.367 --> 01:09:17.291
Boone, Miguel got away, but now Ryan's
after him. They're heading your way.

01:09:17.371 --> 01:09:19.029
<i>Boone, hurry!</i>

01:09:32.185 --> 01:09:34.707
Denny, you're gonna have to
send someone else to get Miguel.

01:09:34.787 --> 01:09:36.612
There is no one else.

01:10:08.822 --> 01:10:10.679
I'm sorry, Denny.

01:10:11.959 --> 01:10:13.998
<i>I should have listened to Jackson.</i>

01:10:15.028 --> 01:10:17.386
Hold on, Boone! Help's coming.

01:10:20.868 --> 01:10:24.126
Okay, I'll read to you next time.
I promise. Get some sleep.

01:10:25.338 --> 01:10:26.928
Denny.

01:10:27.908 --> 01:10:29.697
- Denny?
- Jackson, turn on your computer!

01:10:29.777 --> 01:10:32.834
- Boone needs you!
- Hold on. Hold on. Slow down.

01:10:33.514 --> 01:10:36.709
- <i>Now, wait. What? Denny?</i>
- I think someone's trying to get in the van.

01:10:40.186 --> 01:10:41.609
Denny?

01:10:41.689 --> 01:10:43.512
Oh, man.

01:10:48.261 --> 01:10:49.517
Boone?

01:10:49.897 --> 01:10:51.385
<i>You alive?</i>

01:10:51.465 --> 01:10:54.294
- Jackson?
- <i>Are you okay?</i>

01:10:56.403 --> 01:10:59.348
You were right, man. I'm sorry.

01:11:01.141 --> 01:11:03.477
We're all good, bro.
I just need you to listen to me.

01:11:03.557 --> 01:11:07.267
Get ready to scoot to the left and take out
this big guy that's coming to you, right now.

01:11:07.347 --> 01:11:09.367
<i>In two, one...</i>

01:11:09.817 --> 01:11:12.207
...now, Boone, now!

01:11:14.588 --> 01:11:17.179
Yes! Get the hell out of there!

01:11:18.591 --> 01:11:21.368
- Why are you slowing down? Run!
- <i>Where?</i>

01:11:21.448 --> 01:11:22.985
Away.

01:12:18.344 --> 01:12:20.642
Turn this son of a bitch around.

01:12:36.637 --> 01:12:39.426
Those guys are trained fighters.
You can't fight them straight up.

01:12:39.506 --> 01:12:42.764
You gotta Boone them.
Towards the 3 o'clock. Go!

01:12:46.412 --> 01:12:50.235
Pick these guys apart, man.
Do some of that flippy stuff you do, man.

01:12:53.206 --> 01:12:55.576
<i>Behind you. Here comes Milli.</i>

01:12:55.926 --> 01:12:57.711
<i>Sack him.</i>

01:12:58.141 --> 01:12:59.913
<i>Drop kick.</i>

01:12:59.993 --> 01:13:03.085
Yeah, that's it! That's it. You got it.

01:13:17.027 --> 01:13:20.174
Find a way to get him off his feet.

01:13:20.254 --> 01:13:22.036
- To your right!
- Got it.

01:13:22.116 --> 01:13:23.502
Kick the barrel.

01:13:25.419 --> 01:13:29.645
Remember that time you Boone'd Carrot Top?
Same move! Hit it, now.

01:13:31.678 --> 01:13:32.908
Yeah!

01:13:34.328 --> 01:13:36.383
He's hurt, man. He's hurt bad.

01:13:37.376 --> 01:13:39.854
- No!
- <i>One down, one to go.</i>

01:13:49.276 --> 01:13:51.934
<i>Oh, damn. Get out. Get out.</i>

01:13:53.747 --> 01:13:55.437
Get the hell out of there.

01:14:07.294 --> 01:14:09.718
Time to die, you bastards.

01:14:23.176 --> 01:14:24.612
Come around.

01:14:25.512 --> 01:14:27.036
Helicopter.

01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:35.244
No.

01:15:07.921 --> 01:15:11.578
- I knew you had this. Good job, Boone.
- Thanks, bro.

01:15:11.658 --> 01:15:14.716
- Bring everyone home.
- <i>Hell yeah.</i>

01:15:23.403 --> 01:15:26.075
One, two, three.

01:15:41.421 --> 01:15:43.512
Holy crap.

01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:55.794
- Get back here!
- It's over, Ryan!

01:15:59.071 --> 01:16:00.660
Ryan, don't.

01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:04.278
Let him go. It's the only way
you're gonna get out of here alive.

01:16:04.358 --> 01:16:07.370
Good show, Boone: The Bounty Hunter...

01:16:08.682 --> 01:16:12.273
...but this episode
will not have a happy ending!

01:16:12.751 --> 01:16:14.575
That's too bad.

01:16:14.655 --> 01:16:17.466
I was really hoping
this could be a Boone special.

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:29.352
<i>Señor</i> Davenport, you got Boone'd!

01:16:30.737 --> 01:16:32.594
Nice work, deputy.

01:16:36.011 --> 01:16:39.101
A-team is right here. Solid!

01:16:45.285 --> 01:16:46.709
Hey!

01:16:50.877 --> 01:16:52.613
Hey.

01:16:53.327 --> 01:16:56.184
- You all right, bro?
- Yeah, how's your leg?

01:17:28.527 --> 01:17:30.817
All right, there, man.

01:17:30.897 --> 01:17:35.522
Hey, I hope you guys don't mind, but when
I was tapping into the security cameras...

01:17:35.602 --> 01:17:37.124
...I...

01:17:38.404 --> 01:17:40.228
...I hit record.

01:17:41.857 --> 01:17:44.898
<i>It's an all new season
of "Boone: The Bounty Hunter."</i>

01:17:44.978 --> 01:17:47.036
You just got Boone'd.

01:17:50.517 --> 01:17:54.007
- America, you're welcome.
- <i>Starring Denny.</i>

01:17:54.087 --> 01:17:55.842
Bad things are happening. Boone, duck!

01:17:55.922 --> 01:17:57.980
- <i>Kat.</i>
- Incoming.

01:17:58.639 --> 01:18:00.007
<i>Jackson.</i>

01:18:01.187 --> 01:18:03.651
- Yeah!
- <i>And Boone.</i>

01:18:04.631 --> 01:18:06.921
Bad guys always run.

01:18:07.437 --> 01:18:10.859
- You can't take her yourself.
- We've met. She's not that good.

01:18:15.075 --> 01:18:18.031
- <i>It's real action.</i>
- Boone cam.

01:18:18.111 --> 01:18:21.421
- I knew you had this.
- Couldn't do it without my team.

01:18:21.501 --> 01:18:25.507
<i>They're putting bad guys in traction, again.</i>

01:18:27.254 --> 01:18:32.080
<i>"Boone: The Bounty Hunter,"
an all new season this fall.</i>

01:18:35.294 --> 01:18:37.284
Oh, there you are.

01:18:37.364 --> 01:18:38.752
We are all set.

01:18:38.832 --> 01:18:42.289
With Davenport out of the picture,
the territory is wide open.

01:18:43.009 --> 01:18:46.494
I just made you a very rich man.

01:18:47.924 --> 01:18:49.965
When can you move in?

01:18:52.945 --> 01:18:55.168
Here we go. Shooting now.

01:18:55.248 --> 01:18:57.538
Ready and action.

01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:02.077
Boone time!

01:19:02.472 --> 01:19:04.329
Run, you goober.

01:19:08.762 --> 01:19:11.118
Kevin Sorbo, you just got Booned.

01:19:11.198 --> 01:19:13.688
It's a lot better than being boned.

01:19:18.023 --> 01:19:19.887
Pardon us, ma'am.

01:19:19.967 --> 01:19:24.616
At least, well, at least, you know,
being a fashion diva pays off.

01:19:31.808 --> 01:19:36.178
Yes. Booned by ya...
How do you say that... Boone voyage.

01:19:38.247 --> 01:19:41.082
Just a parking ticket! Get off me.

01:19:42.946 --> 01:19:44.885
You want some excitement?

01:19:44.965 --> 01:19:47.806
Three, two, one, action.

01:19:49.002 --> 01:19:51.227
- Perfect timing.
- Boone. Boone.

01:19:51.307 --> 01:19:55.395
Boone. Boone. Boone. Boone. Boone.
Boone. Boone. Boone. Boone.

01:19:55.475 --> 01:19:56.578
Yeah.

01:20:00.747 --> 01:20:02.268
Cut!

01:20:03.150 --> 01:20:05.374
- Camera cut.
- Cut.

01:20:09.156 --> 01:20:12.612
Welcome to Boone County, population you.

01:20:13.292 --> 01:20:16.151
Kick him in the nuts! In the nuts!

01:20:25.272 --> 01:20:27.161
Dude, you good?

01:20:31.977 --> 01:20:35.235
- Back to one.
- And reset and rolling.

01:20:35.815 --> 01:20:38.673
Give me the gun. Where is the gun? Okay.

01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:42.443
You don't mess with me!

01:20:43.623 --> 01:20:45.513
There you go.

01:20:47.014 --> 01:20:49.224
Drink your milk and eat your veggies.
Keep 'em separate, though.

01:20:49.304 --> 01:20:52.852
You don't make friends if you smell like farts.
Never pet a porcupine in the wrong direction.

01:20:52.932 --> 01:20:54.854
Don't wear the same clothes
more than three days in a row.

01:20:54.934 --> 01:20:58.193
You wanna get a Jimmy hat. Don't ride
a motorcycle with your mouth open.

01:21:00.005 --> 01:21:01.830
Don't do drugs.

01:21:07.746 --> 01:21:09.607
Hold on. Hold on.

01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:13.473
- Haven't you had enough?
- No. And you wanna know why?

01:21:13.553 --> 01:21:16.010
'Cause I don't start fights I can't lose.

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:19.414
No, that's not it.

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.316
- That's not it at all.
- But it sounded convincing.

01:21:23.396 --> 01:21:27.055
Well, fine. If it'll help the show,
I'll just hook up with Denny.

01:21:28.668 --> 01:21:30.176
What?

01:21:34.072 --> 01:21:35.564
Okay.

01:21:39.128 --> 01:21:41.185
All right, sorry. I messed up that...

01:22:21.086 --> 01:22:23.243
- Here comes the Boone.
- You got this, Boone.

01:22:23.323 --> 01:22:25.179
Okay, now.

01:22:29.114 --> 01:22:31.719
- Get off me!
- Shut up, <i>chavo .</i>

01:22:32.398 --> 01:22:33.920
Hey!

01:22:34.150 --> 01:22:36.456
- Let's get him.
- You got the handcuffs, right?

01:22:36.536 --> 01:22:39.191
- Oh, no. Damn. I forgot the handcuffs.
- Again, Boone? Again?

01:22:39.271 --> 01:22:41.460
How am I gonna fit handcuffs
into leather pants, bro?

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:43.730
- Just let him go. Just let him go.
- Okay, let's let him go.

01:22:43.810 --> 01:22:45.566
You're welcome.

01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:48.870
And cut!
