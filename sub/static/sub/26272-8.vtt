a dead body and a guilty plea,

09:20.734 --> 09:23.911

Excellent.
I can't even begin to tell you

This is not a case I asked for.
This is not a case I chased.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.624
Nevertheless,
I would like to win,

10:24.667 --> 10:26.016

argument we have,

10:26.060 --> 10:28.149
the only one that makes
any sense at all,

10:28.192 --> 10:30.891
is that this man
was given bad advice.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.980
And that's not gonna ring
terribly true to the jury

10:33.023 --> 10:35.156
if the person who gave him
that bad advice

10:35.199 --> 10:37.811
is sitting next
to him in court.

Before we begin, Your Honor,

10:57.569 --> 10:59.920
the defense would like
to make a pretrial motion

10:59.963 --> 11:02.270
to revoke our client's
guilty plea.

Ms. Bennet,

11:06.100 --> 11:10.582
it was you that recommended
that Mr. Coleman plead guilty.

11:10.626 --> 11:12.628
Isn't that right?Yes.

11:12.672 --> 11:16.588
And you did so even though
he insisted he was innocent.

11:16.632 --> 11:19.722
A-At the time, it seemed like
the best course of action.

11:19.766 --> 11:22.072
For him,
given the circumstances.

11:28.688 --> 11:32.648
Again, just to be clear,

11:32.692 --> 11:36.086
you advised your client
to accept responsibility

11:36.130 --> 11:39.220
for something he didn't do.

11:39.263 --> 11:41.613
You advised him to lie.

11:41.657 --> 11:45.095
Isn't that correct?

11:45.139 --> 11:47.881
Uh, yes.

11:47.924 --> 11:50.884
That's correct.
That's what I did.

11:50.927 --> 11:53.930
And I very much regret it.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.412

Your Honor,
without the guilty plea,

12:06.813 --> 12:07.901
the People's case
would be gutted.

12:07.944 --> 12:09.772
Yeah, but that's
not reason to uphold

12:09.816 --> 12:10.904
an otherwise invalid
guilty plea.

12:10.947 --> 12:13.080
RUSSO: The defendant
made a knowing,

12:13.123 --> 12:15.386
voluntary waiver,
and his admission should stand.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.606
The prosecutor
took advantage of the fact

12:17.649 --> 12:19.739
that Mr. Coleman
doesn't have resources.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.262
JUDGE:
Enough.

12:21.305 --> 12:24.178
I agree with Mr. Colón that
this attorney's representation

12:24.221 --> 12:25.962
was substandard.

12:26.006 --> 12:27.703
And because of that reason,

12:27.747 --> 12:29.836
I will be reporting her
to the state bar.

12:29.879 --> 12:31.838
That said, however,
I find that the defendant

12:31.881 --> 12:33.840
did, in fact, make

12:33.883 --> 12:36.756
a knowing waiver of his rights,
and I'm denying

12:36.799 --> 12:38.670
the defendant's motion
to revoke.

12:38.714 --> 12:40.716
The guilty plea
will stand.

Mr. Coleman, and it failed.

13:01.476 --> 13:04.479
to curate a jury that will
relate to your situation.

and persuade them

who identified him,

19:23.292 --> 19:25.686
they were all part of the group
that taunted him.

19:25.729 --> 19:28.210
These were the same men
who cut in front of him.

19:28.254 --> 19:31.344
I'm sorry,
I didn't see any of that.

19:31.387 --> 19:34.260
BENNY: Well, did you interview
anyone who wasn't involved

19:34.303 --> 19:36.479
in the dispute?
Someone objective?

19:36.523 --> 19:39.395
Look, I followed protocol.

19:39.439 --> 19:41.310
This was a simple assault case.

19:41.354 --> 19:42.616
If I had known
it'd turn into a homicide,

19:42.659 --> 19:45.009
I would have
called the detectives.

19:45.053 --> 19:46.620
What a coincidence.

19:46.663 --> 19:48.796
If my client had known it was
gonna turn into a homicide,

19:48.839 --> 19:50.232
he would've pled not guilty.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.364
Objection.

19:51.407 --> 19:53.801
Sustained. Anything else?

19:53.844 --> 19:55.629
Not at this time, Your Honor.

19:55.672 --> 19:57.108
Thank you, officer...Well, no movement yet,

19:57.152 --> 19:59.241
but positions
are definitely softening.

19:59.285 --> 20:02.331
Nothing like a little common
sense to wake people up.

20:04.638 --> 20:06.030
Do you see the man
who assaulted your friend?

20:06.074 --> 20:07.423
Is he here in the courtroom?

20:07.467 --> 20:09.251
That's him right there.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.384
That's the guy who pushed
and punched Connor.

20:11.427 --> 20:13.473
RUSSO: Let the record show
that the witness pointed
to the defendant.

20:13.516 --> 20:16.389
Punched? Now I punched him?
I didn't punch anybody.

20:16.432 --> 20:19.305
Just let them tell their story,
and then we will tell ours.

20:19.348 --> 20:21.307
RUSSO: Can you tell me about
his demeanor that night?

20:21.350 --> 20:23.352
How was he behaving?

20:23.396 --> 20:25.354
He was pretty intense.

20:25.398 --> 20:27.269
Uh, I think there might have
been something going on

20:27.313 --> 20:28.488
between him and his wife.

20:28.531 --> 20:30.272
And also, just my opinion,

20:30.316 --> 20:33.188
I think he might have been
a little drunk.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.234
[scoffs]

20:37.453 --> 20:40.064
Hmm...

20:40.108 --> 20:41.283
CHRIS:
Drunk.

20:41.327 --> 20:42.893
Guy said I was drunk?

20:42.937 --> 20:45.461
I haven't had
a drink in six months, man.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.507
Like I told you in court,
they will tell their story,

20:47.550 --> 20:49.422
and then we will tell ours.

20:49.465 --> 20:51.772
Appearances are important.

20:51.815 --> 20:54.296
The jury's always watching,
and every time they look at you,

20:54.340 --> 20:56.951
they see an angry guy
who can't control his temper.

20:56.994 --> 21:00.737
W-Well, maybe it's 'cause I am
a really angry guy.

21:00.781 --> 21:03.523
[sighs]

21:05.002 --> 21:06.700
The man said I was drunk.

21:06.743 --> 21:08.484
I just got my six month chip.

21:08.528 --> 21:11.313
You know, you know
how hard I worked for that?

21:11.357 --> 21:13.228
And I promise you,
we'll share that with the jury

21:13.272 --> 21:14.577
when you testify.

21:14.621 --> 21:16.318
In the meantime,
stop helping their case.

21:16.362 --> 21:19.582
Lose the anger, lose the
attitude, and start behaving

21:19.626 --> 21:22.324
like a guy who was buying
a present for his kid

21:22.368 --> 21:24.413
and not a guy who was
looking for a fight.

21:24.457 --> 21:26.023
Don't tell me how to act!

21:26.067 --> 21:29.200
I'm going through
hell right now, man!

21:30.289 --> 21:33.161
I'm still in hell right now!

21:33.204 --> 21:35.555
[sighs]

21:35.598 --> 21:40.211
I just lost my apartment,
my job, my wife.

21:40.255 --> 21:41.517
I'm about to lose my kid!

21:41.561 --> 21:44.390
And I'm facing 20! 20 years!

21:44.433 --> 21:46.348
20 years in prison!

21:46.392 --> 21:48.524
And you two are what?
What are you doing?

21:48.568 --> 21:50.700
What are you doing?
You're just sitting there!

21:50.744 --> 21:53.355
You're just sitting there and
you're just watching it happen!

21:53.399 --> 21:56.532
Mr. Coleman,
if you are at all unhappy

21:56.576 --> 21:58.186
about the quality
of your representation,

21:58.229 --> 22:00.536
your free representation...Bull...

22:00.580 --> 22:02.059
[door opens]

22:02.103 --> 22:03.365
Time to get
back on the bus.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.498
[sighs] Just give me a minute.

22:05.541 --> 22:07.935
Hey, you don't have a minute;
the bus needs to roll.

22:07.978 --> 22:10.154
Hey, I'm talking to my lawyer!
What the hell is wrong with you?

22:10.198 --> 22:11.547
BULL: He'll be right there,
Officer.

22:11.591 --> 22:14.594
My fault,
I lost track of the time.

22:14.637 --> 22:16.944
[sighs]

22:18.815 --> 22:20.077
Thanks for dinner.

22:21.992 --> 22:23.777
It's the least I can do.

22:25.518 --> 22:29.609
Look, if you want to quit,
I'd totally understand.

22:29.652 --> 22:32.786
I can fly solo
from here.

22:32.829 --> 22:36.398
I honestly don't think
the guy did it, but...

22:36.442 --> 22:38.226
he can't get out
of his own way

22:38.269 --> 22:40.228
and I'm not sure I can help
someone like that.

22:40.271 --> 22:42.622
[phone ringing]

22:42.665 --> 22:43.797
Hello?

22:43.840 --> 22:45.233
Speaking.

22:47.627 --> 22:49.585
Oh.

22:49.629 --> 22:51.108
Well, i-is he okay?

22:54.634 --> 22:58.681
Will he be able to
come to court tomorrow?

22:58.725 --> 23:00.291
[sighs]

23:00.335 --> 23:02.337
I-I understand.

23:03.599 --> 23:04.948
No, o-okay. All right.

23:04.992 --> 23:07.124
W-We'll ask the judge
for a one day continuance.

23:07.168 --> 23:10.214
Thank you for
letting me know.

23:10.258 --> 23:14.088
[sighs]

23:14.131 --> 23:17.221
Tha-That was,
that was the prison.

23:17.265 --> 23:19.354
Chris is in
the hospital.

23:19.398 --> 23:23.576
Someone picked a fight
with him in the cafeteria.

23:23.619 --> 23:25.665
[scoffs]

23:25.708 --> 23:30.452
Must've hit the guy pretty
hard; he broke his wrist.

23:30.496 --> 23:33.281
Great. Now we can't
put him on the stand.

23:33.324 --> 23:35.326
The second his ass
hits the chair,

23:35.370 --> 23:37.111
the prosecutor will want
to cross-examine him

23:37.154 --> 23:39.200
about the fact that he got
into another fight

23:39.243 --> 23:42.551
and they will argue that he has
a propensity for violence.

23:44.248 --> 23:47.164
And they'll be right.

23:54.345 --> 23:55.346
[door opens]

23:57.174 --> 23:59.263
Oh. It's nice of
you to show up.

23:59.307 --> 24:01.396
I think so.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.007
Well, uh, you're an hour
late, so let me just ask you,

24:04.051 --> 24:05.879
when we ask you
to come to court,

24:05.922 --> 24:07.141
are you gonna be on time?

24:07.184 --> 24:08.838
Because a judge is not
gonna wait an hour.

24:08.882 --> 24:11.275
My sitter cancelled.You have a cell phone.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.887
As a matter of fact, I do.

24:13.930 --> 24:15.845
But I ran out of minutes.

24:16.542 --> 24:19.327
[phone thuds on table]

24:19.370 --> 24:21.677
I need you to understand,
when I come see you,

24:21.721 --> 24:23.810
when I come to court,
it costs me.

24:23.853 --> 24:24.811
I get that.

24:24.854 --> 24:26.465
No, I don't think you do.

24:26.508 --> 24:29.468
My kid wants to know why his
father isn't coming to see him.

24:29.511 --> 24:33.341
And now that Chris is in jail,
he can't pay child support.

24:33.384 --> 24:36.213
We're trying to fix that, but
that's why we need your help.

24:39.782 --> 24:41.828
I love him.

24:41.871 --> 24:45.005
I really do.

24:45.048 --> 24:48.617
But if it's not the drinking,
it's the temper.

24:48.661 --> 24:50.619
And if it's not the temper...Everybody's lives

24:50.663 --> 24:53.709
are gonna be better if we
can get him out of jail.

24:55.929 --> 24:59.236
Look, the truth is,
I didn't see the whole fight.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.022
I can't talk about
the part when

25:02.065 --> 25:04.024
Chris pushed that man.

25:04.067 --> 25:07.114
I saw the beginning and the end,
not the middle.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.770
I was focused on finding help.

25:10.813 --> 25:14.338
So you can't testify
about how Connor fell?

25:14.382 --> 25:17.385
I didn't say that.

25:17.428 --> 25:20.170
E-Excuse me?

25:20.214 --> 25:25.001
I could say that
it looked to me like...

25:27.134 --> 25:29.702
...that guy Connor tripped.

25:29.745 --> 25:33.575
That it had nothing to do
with Chris's shove.

25:33.619 --> 25:36.186
Wait. A-Are you
talking about lying?

25:36.230 --> 25:37.753
No.

25:37.797 --> 25:40.190
We do not lie in
a court of law.

25:40.234 --> 25:42.279
It never helps,
it only hurts.

25:42.323 --> 25:45.065
Trust me, the last
thing you want is for

25:45.108 --> 25:47.676
both of your child's
parents to be behind bars.

25:53.073 --> 25:54.944
[knocking at door]DANNY:
Gabriel?

25:54.988 --> 25:56.598
[knocking resumes, keys jangle]

25:56.642 --> 25:58.600
[door unlocks]

26:11.439 --> 26:14.834
[gasps] Oh, what the
hell are you doing?
It's me.
It's me, it's me, it's me.

26:14.877 --> 26:17.184
[groans]

26:19.403 --> 26:21.362
DANNY: I've been trying
to get ahold of you

26:21.405 --> 26:23.930
for the last 24 hours.

26:23.973 --> 26:25.584
You want to tell me
about last night?

26:27.237 --> 26:29.805
Yeah, sure. I-I had the chicken.

26:29.849 --> 26:32.155
It was good.You know what
I'm talking about.

26:32.199 --> 26:35.550
All of a sudden, you decide
to impersonate McDreamy

26:35.594 --> 26:38.727
and perform an operation
in the middle of dinner,

26:38.771 --> 26:40.947
and then it's "We got
to go, we got to go,"

26:40.990 --> 26:43.993
and as soon as we grab an
Uber and I get in the car,

26:44.037 --> 26:45.952
you ditch me.I did not ditch you.

26:45.995 --> 26:48.345
You slammed the door closed
and headed for the subway.

26:48.389 --> 26:50.957
Well, you know, we-we live
on different parts in the city.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.176
Okay? It's just
more efficient that way.

26:53.220 --> 26:55.222
You know, you're really
good with a bottle of vodka

26:55.265 --> 26:58.138
and a table knife, but
you are a terrible liar.

26:58.181 --> 27:00.444
Okay.

27:00.488 --> 27:02.098
How did you know
how to do that?

27:02.142 --> 27:05.885
How did you know how to
save that man's life?

27:05.928 --> 27:08.104
I unclog toilets for a living.

27:08.148 --> 27:10.280
It's-it's really not
that different.

27:12.935 --> 27:15.285
What?Thanks for the company.
And the sex.

27:15.329 --> 27:16.896
Okay, loo-- Stop!

27:16.939 --> 27:19.681
Please, d-don't be so dramatic.

27:21.683 --> 27:24.555
It was a simple
needle decompression.

27:24.599 --> 27:28.081
Okay? Any doctor can do it.

27:28.124 --> 27:30.083
What does that mean?

27:30.126 --> 27:33.913
It means that
before I came here,

27:33.956 --> 27:39.614
before all of this,
I was a surgeon.

27:41.747 --> 27:44.488
A cardiothoracic surgeon.

27:44.532 --> 27:48.275
But you say that like
it's a bad thing.

27:48.318 --> 27:50.494
Why would you keep something
like that a secret from me?

27:50.538 --> 27:53.454
Because I don't...
I don't want to go to jail.

27:53.497 --> 27:55.238
Okay?

27:55.282 --> 27:57.023
I don't want
to be sent back home.

27:57.066 --> 28:00.156
'Cause I don't want to die.

28:02.158 --> 28:04.378
They cut in front of us,

28:04.421 --> 28:08.208
and then I said something

28:08.251 --> 28:10.819
about going to the back
of the line.

28:10.863 --> 28:12.778
And how did the men react?

28:12.821 --> 28:16.042
The man that died,

28:16.085 --> 28:19.480
he punched my husband,
right in the face.

28:19.523 --> 28:21.482
BENNY:
You saw that?

28:21.525 --> 28:23.876
GINA: Yes, I did. And then
they all surrounded him,

28:23.919 --> 28:25.399
and I went to go get help.

28:25.442 --> 28:28.141
Did you feel threatened?

28:28.184 --> 28:30.143
Oh, my God, yes.

28:30.186 --> 28:32.711
That's why I called
for security.

28:32.754 --> 28:34.669
Nothing further, Your Honor.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.932
We are batting .500.

28:36.976 --> 28:39.021
I am feeling a little momentum.

28:39.065 --> 28:40.849
This is the easy part.

28:40.893 --> 28:44.287
Let's see how she
holds up on cross.

28:44.331 --> 28:46.681
Mrs. Coleman, are you aware
that phone calls

28:46.725 --> 28:48.030
at the jail are recorded?

28:49.684 --> 28:51.425
No, I didn't know that.

28:51.468 --> 28:53.993
Objection. Counsel's
badgering the witness.

28:54.036 --> 28:55.429
What's the point here?

28:55.472 --> 28:58.475
I'll cut to the chase,
Your Honor.

29:00.521 --> 29:03.654
CHRIS [over recording]:
Did you meet with the lawyers?

29:03.698 --> 29:05.787
Is that your husband's voice?

29:05.831 --> 29:08.268
Yes.

29:08.311 --> 29:12.098
GINA [over recording]:
Yeah. I talked to them.

29:12.141 --> 29:14.753
I told them I'd do anything
to get you out of there.

29:14.796 --> 29:17.233
I even told them I'd lie.

29:17.277 --> 29:18.626
And that's you, isn't it?

29:18.669 --> 29:20.106
BENNY:
Objection.

29:20.149 --> 29:21.498
Move to strike.

29:21.542 --> 29:23.283
Overruled. The jury may
consider the recording,

29:23.326 --> 29:25.024
as it pertains
to the credibility

29:25.067 --> 29:26.939
of the witness.

29:26.982 --> 29:28.114
Anything else?

29:28.157 --> 29:30.333
Just-just one more question.

29:30.377 --> 29:33.162
How do we know
you're not lying now?

29:33.206 --> 29:35.948
Because I'm not.

29:35.991 --> 29:40.953
RUSSO: I have no more questions
for this witness.

29:40.996 --> 29:42.998
MARISSA:
Remember those six greens?

29:43.042 --> 29:46.959
Well, two of them
just turned red.

29:47.002 --> 29:49.004
Terrific.

29:56.490 --> 29:57.839
[sighs]The case isn't even over.

29:57.883 --> 29:59.145
He's already celebrating.

29:59.188 --> 30:01.930
Ah, that guy
oozes ambition.

30:01.974 --> 30:03.714
An ugly ooze.

30:03.758 --> 30:07.762
Probably keeps a running tally
of his cases on the wall.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.372
A running tally?

30:09.416 --> 30:12.593
Like a scorecard?
Like a fantasy football grid?

30:12.636 --> 30:15.074
Oh, yeah. I've seen
all different kinds.

30:15.117 --> 30:17.250
It's the A.D.A.s
on misdemeanor row.

30:17.293 --> 30:19.382
They're itching to
get off of there.

30:19.426 --> 30:22.081
Itching to work
felony cases.

30:22.124 --> 30:24.083
They have a
scoring system.No kidding.

30:24.126 --> 30:25.911
And the person with the most
points at the end of the week

30:25.954 --> 30:27.651
wins a pot of money.

30:27.695 --> 30:31.220
But more importantly, they're
one step closer to a promotion.

30:31.264 --> 30:33.614
I guarantee you our
client is up there.

30:33.657 --> 30:35.311
And I'll bet it
pays off big.

30:35.355 --> 30:37.792
I suddenly remembered
I have an errand to run.

30:37.836 --> 30:41.448
You go on in and I will
join you as soon as I can.

30:41.491 --> 30:43.929
Whatever you say.

30:52.807 --> 30:54.461
MAN:
Can I help you?

30:54.504 --> 30:56.202
Frank's not here.

30:56.245 --> 30:58.378
Really? You sure?

30:58.421 --> 31:00.815
He told me to meet him here
for a conference.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.382
Actually, he's in court.

31:02.425 --> 31:04.384
Really? How is that possible?

31:04.427 --> 31:05.907
I thought we were getting
a late start today.

31:05.951 --> 31:07.387
I must have missed a text.Uh, must have.

31:07.430 --> 31:08.867
Senior moment.

31:08.910 --> 31:10.042
Hmm.

31:13.088 --> 31:16.309
LEE: Mr. Colón,
call your next witness.

31:16.352 --> 31:19.355
[clears throat]

31:19.399 --> 31:22.576
The defense would like to call
A.D.A. Russo to the stand.

31:22.619 --> 31:24.708
LEE: The defense
wants to call

31:24.752 --> 31:26.319
the prosecutor to the stand?

31:26.362 --> 31:28.103
BENNY: If it
pleases the court.

31:28.147 --> 31:30.584
Objection, Your Honor.
I am not a witness.

31:30.627 --> 31:33.108
I wasn't there. These guys
are playing some kind of game.

31:33.152 --> 31:35.545
Both of you, get up here.

31:41.203 --> 31:44.076
You want to tell me
what's going on, Mr. Colón?

31:44.119 --> 31:45.991
Nothing's going on,
your Honor.

31:46.034 --> 31:48.950
I know he's new at this, but
hopefully the prosecutor knows

31:48.994 --> 31:50.299
that there is nothing
in the rules

31:50.343 --> 31:52.606
that precludes us from
calling him to testify.

31:52.649 --> 31:54.564
Respectfully, Judge...

31:54.608 --> 31:57.132
Just go sit
in the witness box, Mr. Russo.

32:02.616 --> 32:04.400
BENNY:
A.D.A. Russo,

32:04.444 --> 32:07.012
you've been out
of law school, what,

32:07.055 --> 32:09.623
a year?
18 months.

32:09.666 --> 32:11.233
And I'm guessing
this is your first big case?

32:11.277 --> 32:14.149
Can I object? Is this relevant?

32:14.193 --> 32:15.977
Mr. Colón?

32:16.021 --> 32:17.761
I'd submit that it's
very relevant, Your Honor,

32:17.805 --> 32:22.027
but I'd be happy to move on
if Your Honor prefers.

32:22.070 --> 32:23.463
LEE:
Move along.

32:27.510 --> 32:31.036
You recognize this?

32:33.081 --> 32:36.215
Yes, I recognize it. It's, um,

32:36.258 --> 32:39.131
well, it's a photograph of, uh,
something we use in the office

32:39.174 --> 32:41.698
to track, uh, cases.

32:41.742 --> 32:43.874
Kind of a scorecard, right?

32:43.918 --> 32:45.659
Your Honor, I have to object.

32:45.702 --> 32:46.921
Answer the question.

32:50.316 --> 32:53.884
Kind of.
Um, it's common practice.

32:53.928 --> 32:57.149
It's a performance
incentive chart.

32:57.192 --> 32:58.933
BENNY:
Really?

32:58.977 --> 33:03.459
Why are my client's
initials on it?

33:03.503 --> 33:05.505
In the win column?

33:05.548 --> 33:07.289
Next to a jackpot?

33:07.333 --> 33:09.639
Um, I'm not sure
that's referring to your client.

33:09.683 --> 33:13.034
Let me remind you that
you are still under oath,

33:13.078 --> 33:15.428
Mr. Assistant
District Attorney.

33:15.471 --> 33:20.128
Now, in keeping
with the holidays,

33:20.172 --> 33:22.565
let's talk turkey.

33:22.609 --> 33:26.178
This is your first big case,
which means if you win it,

33:26.221 --> 33:28.006
my client will be your ticket

33:28.049 --> 33:31.835
out of what young A.D.A.s
like to call "misdemeanor row."

33:31.879 --> 33:34.534
Isn't that right?
I mean,

33:34.577 --> 33:37.232
if you win this case,
in all likelihood,

33:37.276 --> 33:39.669
you'll be promoted
to felonies, won't you?

33:39.713 --> 33:41.802
You'd have to ask my boss.

33:41.845 --> 33:44.065
I'm asking you what you think.

33:44.109 --> 33:46.459
You believe this case
will help you

33:46.502 --> 33:48.591
move you up the ladder,
don't you?

33:48.635 --> 33:51.246
I suppose so, yes.

33:51.290 --> 33:54.336
You suppose so?

33:54.380 --> 33:58.471
Well, isn't this supposed to be
about justice?

33:58.514 --> 34:01.604
Isn't this supposed to be
about innocence and guilt?

34:01.648 --> 34:03.215
I never said it wasn't.

34:03.258 --> 34:06.174
Look at this card and tell me,

34:06.218 --> 34:08.133
tell the jury,
tell the man

34:08.176 --> 34:11.092
that you're prosecuting,
that this is about the law,

34:11.136 --> 34:16.141
that this is about faith,
honor and fairness,

34:16.184 --> 34:17.794
and not about naked ambition,

34:17.838 --> 34:20.667
that-that these...
these dollar signs

34:20.710 --> 34:23.452
mean that you are here
to fight the good fight.

34:23.496 --> 34:24.758
Tell them, A.D.A. Russo.

34:26.803 --> 34:28.370
Never mind.

34:28.414 --> 34:31.286
I withdraw the question.

34:31.330 --> 34:35.203
Go ahead, cross-examine yourself
if you'd like.

34:35.247 --> 34:37.553
I love when he gets
righteous like that.

34:37.597 --> 34:39.381
Makes the hairs
on the back of my neck

34:39.425 --> 34:41.383
stand up and do a happy dance.

34:47.389 --> 34:49.130
BULL:
So all that's left

34:49.174 --> 34:51.219
is closing arguments,
and once that's done,

34:51.263 --> 34:53.395
we wait.
Uh, for what?

34:53.439 --> 34:55.005
The jury.

34:55.049 --> 34:57.225
Okay, and, um, how long
does that usually take?

34:57.269 --> 34:59.314
Varies. Could be
a couple of days.

34:59.358 --> 35:00.620
Could be a couple of weeks.

35:00.663 --> 35:02.404
Juries in
murder trials

35:02.448 --> 35:07.192
want to come back with unanimous
verdicts. Guilty. Not guilty.

35:07.235 --> 35:08.802
Most of the time,
they feel they've failed

35:08.845 --> 35:10.847
if they can't come
to a decision.

35:10.891 --> 35:12.240
And everybody has
their own theories

35:12.284 --> 35:15.069
on what's a good sign
and what's a bad sign.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.463
What does it mean
if they're out for a long time?

35:17.506 --> 35:20.161
What does it mean if
they come back quickly?

35:20.205 --> 35:22.598
And, uh, what's yours?
Uh, h-how do you think it works?

35:22.642 --> 35:25.166
You think if-if they take
a long time, that that's, um,

35:25.210 --> 35:28.169
it's good for us,
it's bad for us?

35:28.213 --> 35:31.651
Look...

35:31.694 --> 35:35.002
there is no science
to this at all,

35:35.045 --> 35:37.309
but I tend to believe
that it is harder for a jury

35:37.352 --> 35:40.138
to convict a man,
send a man to prison,

35:40.181 --> 35:41.617
than it is to acquit

35:41.661 --> 35:44.098
a man, so once
they've been out

35:44.142 --> 35:48.189
for a couple of days,
I get nervous, but like I said,

35:48.233 --> 35:49.408
that's not science.

35:49.451 --> 35:51.497
Have you ever had it where,

35:51.540 --> 35:53.194
right after you give
your closing arguments,

35:53.238 --> 35:56.328
the jury right there goes,
"Boom, not guilty"?

35:56.371 --> 35:58.068
No, that doesn't happen.

35:58.112 --> 35:59.940
'Cause I mean,
I didn't do anything.

35:59.983 --> 36:04.292
I know, but that doesn't happen.

36:04.336 --> 36:07.077
BENNY:
Y'all have been

36:07.121 --> 36:10.211
sitting here
for almost a week now,

36:10.255 --> 36:12.996
and here's what we know:

36:13.040 --> 36:16.609
The only piece of evidence
they have against my client

36:16.652 --> 36:18.045
is his guilty plea.

36:18.088 --> 36:22.789
Hmm? So w-what informed
that guilty plea?

36:22.832 --> 36:27.576
Was it a, uh, thorough
investigation of the facts?

36:27.620 --> 36:30.275
Was that plea
arrived at after, uh,

36:30.318 --> 36:34.235
hours of thought
and deliberation?

36:34.279 --> 36:38.631
Was my client even allowed
to get a second opinion?

36:38.674 --> 36:41.155
None of the above,
ladies and gentlemen.

36:41.199 --> 36:45.551
That is because this plea
is not about justice.

36:45.594 --> 36:47.292
It's not about the truth.

36:47.335 --> 36:50.686
It's about allowing
everybody to go home

36:50.730 --> 36:53.646
the day after Thanksgiving,
so that they could enjoy

36:53.689 --> 36:55.430
what little they had left

36:55.474 --> 36:59.347
of what should've been
a four-day weekend.

36:59.391 --> 37:01.349
That's it.

37:01.393 --> 37:03.264
So my client did
what he was told

37:03.308 --> 37:05.701
because he wanted
to get out of there, too.

37:05.745 --> 37:08.051
But keep in mind,

37:08.095 --> 37:12.012
my client didn't actually do
anything wrong.

37:12.055 --> 37:15.624
He defended himself.

37:15.668 --> 37:18.453
He defended his wife,
and that's not against the law.

37:18.497 --> 37:23.023
He pushed a man that
was coming at him.

37:23.066 --> 37:26.244
A man that had already
punched him in the head.

37:26.287 --> 37:28.289
A man that was bigger than him.

37:28.333 --> 37:32.728
A man that was clearly
under the influence of alcohol.

37:32.772 --> 37:34.382
I...

37:36.428 --> 37:39.300
I'm sorry. I-I was just...

37:39.344 --> 37:42.085
listening for a second.

37:42.129 --> 37:44.871
I wanted to see
if I could hear it.

37:44.914 --> 37:46.873
The-the thing that my client did

37:46.916 --> 37:50.311
that was against the law.

37:50.355 --> 37:53.967
Nope. Not yet.

37:54.010 --> 37:55.838
B-But wait, wait, wait.

37:55.882 --> 37:58.624
A week later,
the man that my client

37:58.667 --> 38:01.627
was defending himself
against died.

38:01.670 --> 38:03.411
And now, suddenly,

38:03.455 --> 38:06.806
I-I guess because they had
his guilty plea,

38:06.849 --> 38:08.416
the prosecutor decides,
let's call it

38:08.460 --> 38:12.333
manslaughter and let's charge
Chris Coleman with it.

38:12.377 --> 38:15.771
A-Are they saying
that-that-that the victim

38:15.815 --> 38:18.121
was-was shoved to death?

38:18.165 --> 38:21.124
No. He died of a brain injury.

38:21.168 --> 38:23.866
What-what,
do they know?

38:23.910 --> 38:26.956
Are-are they certain that the,
that the brain injury

38:27.000 --> 38:29.524
was a result of the fall
he took that night?

38:29.568 --> 38:32.484
I haven't seen any
evidence of that,

38:32.527 --> 38:35.095
but-but let's give them
the benefit of a doubt.

38:35.138 --> 38:37.358
My client didn't-didn't
trip him.

38:37.402 --> 38:40.535
My client didn't push him
to the ground.

38:40.579 --> 38:42.363
So why did he fall?

38:42.407 --> 38:46.933
Was it perhaps because, uh,
he drank too much?

38:46.976 --> 38:50.980
Was it perhaps because
the sidewalk was uneven?

38:51.024 --> 38:53.809
Did he have a trick ankle?

38:53.853 --> 38:55.985
Of course, none of these things

38:56.029 --> 38:58.771
have anything to do
with my client.

38:58.814 --> 39:01.774
So why is
my client here?

39:01.817 --> 39:05.473
Well, because he-he
decided to plead guilty

39:05.517 --> 39:09.651
to make it easy for everyone,
including himself, to get home?

39:09.695 --> 39:12.524
Because an ambitious prosecutor

39:12.567 --> 39:16.092
thinks that convicting
somebody, anybody,

39:16.136 --> 39:17.442
will be good
for his career?

39:17.485 --> 39:19.661
Wha... [stammers]

39:19.705 --> 39:21.663
Because, uh-uh,
the world

39:21.707 --> 39:24.840
needs to be saved from, uh, dads

39:24.884 --> 39:27.539
trying to find good deals on
Christmas gifts for their kids?

39:27.582 --> 39:30.455
Well, the point is,

39:30.498 --> 39:33.414
any one of us could've been

39:33.458 --> 39:35.938
standing in that line
that night.

39:35.982 --> 39:39.812
Any one of us here.

39:39.855 --> 39:42.205
Now staring at 20 years
in prison.

39:45.905 --> 39:48.429
Still nothing.

39:48.473 --> 39:51.693
I don't hear a thing.

39:51.737 --> 39:54.174
I guess it's because
I have no idea

39:54.217 --> 39:57.264
what this man
is actually guilty of.

39:57.307 --> 39:59.309
Thank you.

40:01.181 --> 40:02.530
CHRIS:
So now we wait.

40:02.574 --> 40:05.490
So now we wait.

40:09.755 --> 40:11.713
Thank you for those words.

40:11.757 --> 40:14.368
And, uh,

40:14.412 --> 40:17.415
thank you for
saying it that way.

40:22.507 --> 40:24.857
How'd you feel if I came out
to the prison next week?

40:24.900 --> 40:26.336
Just to visit.

40:27.816 --> 40:29.514
Sure.
Yeah.

40:29.557 --> 40:31.559
And with the holidays coming up,

40:31.603 --> 40:34.736
I'll arrange for your wife
and son to come see you.

40:34.780 --> 40:36.172
You're okay with that, right?

40:36.216 --> 40:39.611
Yeah, that'd be great.

40:39.654 --> 40:41.656
[knock at door]

40:41.700 --> 40:46.400
The bus is here.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.489
Oh, good, everybody's
still here.

40:48.533 --> 40:49.925
Jury's back.

40:49.969 --> 40:51.536
Excuse me?

40:51.579 --> 40:53.407
Jury's back.
They have a verdict.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.758
LEE:
Mr. Foreman,

40:56.802 --> 40:58.717
in the matter of The State v. Chris Coleman,

40:58.760 --> 41:00.240
what do you find?

41:00.283 --> 41:02.285
We the jury find
the defendant...

41:04.984 --> 41:06.376
...not guilty.
