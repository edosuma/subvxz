00:37.000 --> 00:39.960
Hello, lovely. Do you need a light?

00:58.960 --> 01:00.959
What time is it?!

01:00.960 --> 01:03.503
Time we had a full and frank discussion.

01:03.504 --> 01:05.959
I thought we agreed
I'd do this on my own.

01:05.960 --> 01:08.960
- When did we agree that?
- Five minutes ago, in the kitchen.

01:10.255 --> 01:12.639
May I be candid, Sidney?

01:12.640 --> 01:14.156
When have you been anything else?

01:14.157 --> 01:16.479
You look done in.

01:16.480 --> 01:18.412
My father had the same look once.

01:18.413 --> 01:19.765
Took to his bed for a fortnight.

01:19.766 --> 01:22.046
Vital exhaustion, they called it.

01:22.047 --> 01:23.960
Vital exhaustion!

01:23.961 --> 01:25.585
Have you seen my jacket?

01:25.586 --> 01:27.329
Has the black dog come calling?

01:27.330 --> 01:29.009
Black dog...

01:29.010 --> 01:31.329
Stop repeating everything in that tone.

01:31.330 --> 01:34.039
- I don't have a tone.
- You're all tone, Mrs C.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.838
If you don't pull your socks up,

01:35.839 --> 01:37.957
I'll have to have a word with
the archdeacon.

01:37.958 --> 01:39.329
We agreed no threats.

01:39.330 --> 01:40.330
When did we agree that?

01:40.331 --> 01:42.329
Five minutes ago, in the kitchen.

01:42.330 --> 01:43.849
I've been distracted.

01:44.180 --> 01:47.329
I know I have. I'll, er...
I'll be better. I'm sorry.

01:47.740 --> 01:50.500
We're... We're not looking for
an apology.

01:51.330 --> 01:53.329
If you need someone to listen...

01:53.330 --> 01:55.329
or... rail at...

01:55.330 --> 01:57.329
You've helped me an awful lot.

01:57.330 --> 01:59.329
Let me return the favour.

01:59.330 --> 02:03.010
It's the black dog, Leonard.
He'll go away of his own accord.

02:11.829 --> 02:13.330
♪ And it is, it is ♪

02:13.331 --> 02:15.329
♪ A glorious thing to be ♪

02:15.330 --> 02:16.849

02:16.850 --> 02:19.719
- DI Keating?
- The last time I checked.

02:19.720 --> 02:21.330
DI Sean Donovan.

02:22.330 --> 02:25.009
- We're sharing an office.
- Are we?

02:25.387 --> 02:26.706
There was a memo.

02:26.731 --> 02:27.731
Was there?

02:28.170 --> 02:29.170
Oh.

02:33.700 --> 02:35.329
- So there was.
- Yeah.

02:35.330 --> 02:38.329
Spent all that money
on a new place and...

02:38.330 --> 02:39.700
still not enough room.

02:43.210 --> 02:44.569
I'm Geordie.

02:44.594 --> 02:46.233
People call me Geordie, so, ah...

02:46.258 --> 02:47.258
Right.

02:53.370 --> 02:56.329
Assault victim, young lady,
picked up down the Kite.

02:56.330 --> 02:58.842
- In a bad way, apparently.
- What's the Kite?

02:58.843 --> 03:00.892
- It's a rough end of town.
- It's a dive.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.180
It's all yours, Keating.

03:09.903 --> 03:11.423
Just a second.

03:12.723 --> 03:15.083
Is there anybody I can get for you,
my love?

03:16.759 --> 03:17.958
Sidney.

03:17.983 --> 03:19.783
Chambers.

03:34.331 --> 03:36.700
Going for a three-pronged attack,
are they?

03:38.010 --> 03:40.170
It was a few too many beers, Geordie.

03:41.330 --> 03:44.330
Let's be honest, it's hardly
the most unusual of occurrences.

03:45.330 --> 03:46.330
Sidney?

03:52.009 --> 03:53.849
How well did you know her?

03:55.330 --> 03:57.169
She gave me a light.

03:57.170 --> 03:58.689
Did you speak to her?

04:00.330 --> 04:01.689
I think so.

04:01.690 --> 04:03.329
She tell you her name?

04:05.170 --> 04:06.845
I don't remember, Geordie.

04:06.846 --> 04:09.329
Jesus! How much did you put away?

04:09.330 --> 04:12.726
- A few whiskies.
- And the rest! Did you screw her?

04:12.727 --> 04:13.819
- No!
- I had to ask.

04:13.820 --> 04:15.330
No, you didn't!

04:17.096 --> 04:18.576
What does that look like to you?

04:20.305 --> 04:22.305
Some kind of puncture wound, maybe?

04:22.660 --> 04:24.330
I didn't hurt her, Geordie.

04:25.330 --> 04:26.330
Oh, give over.

04:28.283 --> 04:29.603
Of course you didn't.

04:36.300 --> 04:38.329
This is where she was dumped.

04:38.330 --> 04:40.330
Right in the middle of the street.

04:42.330 --> 04:43.849
All those windows.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.620
Somebody had to have seen something.

04:57.143 --> 04:59.143
- Penny to mind your car, Guv?
- Sod off.

05:09.330 --> 05:11.330
Watch him on the stairs, love.

05:13.528 --> 05:14.580
Police!

05:18.330 --> 05:20.817
Excuse me, miss. D'you know the girl
who was picked up down there?

05:20.818 --> 05:22.329
Which girl would that be?

05:22.330 --> 05:24.668
Don't be smart. What was her name?

05:25.702 --> 05:27.793
Lottie! Hurry your arse up!

05:27.794 --> 05:29.329
'All right!'

05:29.330 --> 05:31.329
What was her name?

05:31.330 --> 05:33.330
I heard you the first time.

05:39.020 --> 05:40.329
Hold on, miss.

05:40.330 --> 05:42.690
What? I haven't got anything to say.
I'm sorry.

05:49.330 --> 05:50.920
She's dead, isn't she?

05:50.921 --> 05:52.329
I'm sorry.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.540
Oh, my God.

05:56.649 --> 05:58.980
Sadie was a lovely girl, wasn't she?

05:59.740 --> 06:01.329
She always had a smile.

06:01.330 --> 06:03.833
She'd make you laugh
till you'd almost wet your knickers.

06:03.834 --> 06:04.959
Peggy!

06:04.960 --> 06:07.170
Oh, knickers, knickers, knickers.

06:08.503 --> 06:10.503
What line of work was Sadie in?

06:12.583 --> 06:14.423
Seamstress. We all are.

06:20.929 --> 06:22.929
'I'm not sure I deserve it...'

06:23.540 --> 06:25.329
Happiness...

06:26.240 --> 06:27.329
Who's your boss?

06:28.406 --> 06:29.595
Mr Simpson.

06:29.620 --> 06:32.329
- First name?
- We're not on first name terms.

06:32.330 --> 06:35.329
He owns this dump, too.
Charges half a crown a week.

06:35.330 --> 06:38.500
- For the three of you?
- No. Each.

06:39.370 --> 06:42.329
He's a money-grabbing arse.
What can I say?

06:42.330 --> 06:44.329
You really telling me
you didn't see what happened?

06:44.940 --> 06:48.330
You didn't see anything, hear screams?

06:49.740 --> 06:51.329
Look out?

06:51.330 --> 06:54.330
You learn pretty quick
not to look out the window here.

06:55.143 --> 06:56.143
Geordie.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.689
Maybe you gave it to her
because she was cold.

07:00.690 --> 07:03.849
Don't do that.
Don't make me out to be a gentleman.

07:03.850 --> 07:05.329
She was trying to tell me something

07:05.330 --> 07:07.329
and all I could think about
was my next drink.

07:07.330 --> 07:09.329
Those girls know a hell of a lot
more than they're letting on.

07:09.330 --> 07:12.329
- They're afraid.
- Yeah, they're meant to be.

07:12.330 --> 07:14.369
Leaving Sadie lying out here like that...

07:15.180 --> 07:17.330
Someone was warning them.

07:25.330 --> 07:29.170
Oi! Off. Watch the paint-work, you...

07:30.170 --> 07:31.329
- Geordie.
- Hm?

07:31.609 --> 07:32.649
It was hers.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.978
Call me a cynic,

07:42.979 --> 07:45.980
but those girls aren't running up
frocks on a sewing machine.

07:48.330 --> 07:50.330
She was a prostitute.

07:51.216 --> 07:52.216
They all are.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.330
Weren't you paying attention
at all back there?

08:01.330 --> 08:02.663
Mr Simpson, please.

08:02.664 --> 08:04.329
- 'Who's calling?'
- Cambridgeshire Police.

08:04.330 --> 08:05.980
'Hold the line, please.'

08:06.370 --> 08:09.329
Rupert Simpson. Owns half the Kite.

08:09.330 --> 08:12.140
- No criminal record to speak of.
- Knock, Larry.

08:14.330 --> 08:16.027
Next time, knock.

08:16.474 --> 08:17.776
Sorry, Guv.

08:21.330 --> 08:22.918
Property, nightclub...

08:22.919 --> 08:25.329
Simpson's got
his finger in a whole heap of pies.

08:26.020 --> 08:28.329
I can feel your shame
radiating from here.

08:28.330 --> 08:31.650
'Mr Simpson's unavailable.
He's at his golf club in Barton.'

08:31.651 --> 08:32.741
Thank you.

08:32.743 --> 08:35.328
Come on. Chop-chop.

08:41.330 --> 08:42.690
Mr Simpson?

08:44.540 --> 08:46.329
You're ruining my shot.

08:46.330 --> 08:47.902
He's usually in the bunker at this point,

08:47.903 --> 08:50.689
- so I wouldn't worry about it too much.
- DI Keating.

08:50.690 --> 08:54.780
One of your tenants, Sadie Parker,
died this morning.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.329
I'm sorry to hear that.

08:57.820 --> 09:00.100
Do pass on my condolences to her family.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.169
Is that all you've got to say?

09:02.170 --> 09:04.169
I have over 100 tenants.

09:04.170 --> 09:05.329
If I lost sleep over every single one,

09:05.330 --> 09:08.329
- where would I be?
- Not here, probably.

09:08.330 --> 09:09.883
You're all heart, Rupert.

09:09.884 --> 09:11.329
You own Patsy's nightclub?

09:11.330 --> 09:14.329
Have you met Mr Davis?
He runs the council.

09:14.330 --> 09:16.009
Pays your wages.

09:16.010 --> 09:18.329
Just answer the man, so we can
finish this sodding game.

09:18.330 --> 09:22.329
Unless you intend to arrest me,
I respectfully ask you to leave.

09:22.330 --> 09:24.009
Oh, respectfully. That's nice.

09:24.010 --> 09:26.329
- Did you know that she was a prostitute?
- Sidney.

09:26.330 --> 09:28.860
- Have you seen how they live, Mr Simpson?
- I'll be in touch.

09:30.060 --> 09:31.329
Did you kill her?

09:31.330 --> 09:32.330
Get them out of here.

09:32.331 --> 09:34.009
Hey, don't walk away from me.

09:34.010 --> 09:35.055
Did you kill her?

09:35.056 --> 09:36.071
We're going.

09:36.096 --> 09:37.354
- Stand back, sir.
- We're going.

09:40.222 --> 09:43.330
Jesus Christ!
What the hell's wrong with you?

09:51.773 --> 09:55.740
Do you ever feel not right
in your own skin?

09:56.773 --> 09:58.773
Like everything isn't quite
how it should be?

10:00.133 --> 10:01.772
Amanda was a long time ago.

10:01.773 --> 10:03.772
- It's not about her.
- What is it about then, Sidney?

10:03.773 --> 10:06.505
I don't know! If I knew,
I would do something about it.

10:06.506 --> 10:08.292
- Aye-aye-aye...
- What?

10:08.293 --> 10:09.773
This is your life.

10:10.813 --> 10:13.320
It's an endless merry-go-round.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.960
Sin.

10:14.961 --> 10:17.392
Feel bad, drink.

10:17.393 --> 10:19.772
Sin, feel bad, drink.

10:19.773 --> 10:22.772
Oh, come on.

10:22.773 --> 10:25.613
- Don't be like that.
- I'm no use to you, Geordie.

11:11.339 --> 11:12.499
Violet?

11:13.773 --> 11:14.773
Violet?

11:18.773 --> 11:19.773
Violet?

11:22.773 --> 11:23.773
You're still here.

11:24.773 --> 11:26.453
I am.

11:28.048 --> 11:29.407
You look well.

11:29.432 --> 11:31.072
So do you.

11:31.773 --> 11:33.812
Actually, you look awful.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.772
Hangover.

11:35.773 --> 11:36.773
You shock me.

11:36.774 --> 11:38.773
Why didn't you tell me
you were still here?

11:39.773 --> 11:41.900
I'm waiting for Charles's
death certificate,

11:42.293 --> 11:43.773
then I'm going.

11:44.559 --> 11:46.558
Besides, I don't like goodbyes.

11:46.773 --> 11:49.773
Well, then, when the time comes,
we won't say it.

11:51.539 --> 11:53.538
Er... what are you doing now?

11:53.773 --> 11:55.226
I'm going to the post office.

11:55.227 --> 11:57.772
- Well, let me help you.
- I think I can manage.

11:57.773 --> 11:59.026
I'll give you a lift.

11:59.027 --> 12:00.452
Where's your car?

12:00.453 --> 12:01.773
I don't have one.

12:17.225 --> 12:18.420
How's your father?

12:19.773 --> 12:20.773
Not good.

12:21.420 --> 12:22.772
I'm sorry.

12:23.260 --> 12:25.440
Well, he's home now, so...

12:26.499 --> 12:27.772
And Robert?

12:28.300 --> 12:30.073
Why do you care about Robert?

12:30.074 --> 12:31.660
I don't, really.

12:32.613 --> 12:34.612
He's home, too.

12:34.613 --> 12:36.772
That's a terrible...

12:36.773 --> 12:38.772
terrible shame.

12:42.773 --> 12:44.132
This is kinda disgusting.

12:44.133 --> 12:45.507
It's part of the charm.

12:45.508 --> 12:47.772
The disgusting-ness is part of the charm?

12:47.773 --> 12:49.812
Gives us something to moan about.

12:50.220 --> 12:52.772
We Brits are nothing if we don't
have something to moan about.

12:52.773 --> 12:54.773
I've noticed that.

13:26.279 --> 13:27.598
Larry?

13:27.940 --> 13:29.292
Guv.

13:29.293 --> 13:30.772
Knocked off early, have we?

13:30.773 --> 13:31.773
We're working.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.812
Least that's what the girlfriend thinks.

13:34.813 --> 13:36.772
You don't have a girlfriend, Larry.

13:37.620 --> 13:38.773
Behave yourselves.

13:53.672 --> 13:55.180
Whiskey. Double.

13:55.706 --> 13:57.320
Coppers drink for free.

13:57.612 --> 14:00.020
That must keep the wolf from
Mr Simpson's door.

14:00.773 --> 14:02.773
Please leave us alone.

14:07.773 --> 14:09.772
Where's the post office?

14:09.773 --> 14:11.772
Back in Cambridge.

14:11.773 --> 14:13.773
So, this was all a ruse?

14:18.672 --> 14:22.871
Mm-hm! And you call yourself
a man of God...

14:22.973 --> 14:25.772
, You? A man of God?

14:25.773 --> 14:27.133
You're having me on.

14:28.533 --> 14:29.820
What?

14:31.205 --> 14:34.204
Do you ever feel
you're on the wrong path?

14:34.773 --> 14:37.773
A path God doesn't want you to take?

14:38.245 --> 14:39.245
All the time.

14:40.079 --> 14:41.118
Why?

14:42.265 --> 14:44.785
I've made some mistakes recently.

14:46.239 --> 14:48.900
- Present company included?
- I didn't mean you.

14:50.773 --> 14:52.380
Maybe you're on the right path.

14:53.305 --> 14:55.305
Maybe where you're at
is just a turn in the road.

14:57.598 --> 14:58.798
I honestly don't know.

15:10.338 --> 15:12.900
- Gents are that way.
- Did Sadie work here?

15:12.922 --> 15:14.731
You don't understand how
much trouble we'll be in.

15:14.756 --> 15:15.939
Just yes or no.

15:15.940 --> 15:17.646
Yes! Now sod off!

15:18.340 --> 15:20.535
Sorry. I don't mean to be rude.

15:20.560 --> 15:22.719
You're made to do more than
serve drinks, aren't you?

15:22.720 --> 15:24.940
No-one makes us do anything.

15:25.393 --> 15:26.912
Was Sadie working last night?

15:26.937 --> 15:29.695
We work every night.
They get their money's worth.

15:29.720 --> 15:30.980
"They"?

15:31.560 --> 15:32.720
Who's "they"?

15:33.606 --> 15:34.606
Oi!

15:34.721 --> 15:36.719
There's no punters allowed back here.

15:37.079 --> 15:39.079
What about a detective inspector?

15:41.080 --> 15:42.417
These women are prostitutes.

15:42.418 --> 15:43.544
They're hostesses.

15:43.545 --> 15:45.328
Who was Sadie with last night?

15:45.329 --> 15:48.560
What she gets up to on her own time
is none of my business.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.512
But you pick them up from
that slum which Simpson owns.

15:51.537 --> 15:53.820
You bring them to the club
which Simpson owns...

15:54.720 --> 15:56.403
When is their own time?

15:56.404 --> 15:58.719
If they don't like it,
they're free to go.

15:58.720 --> 16:01.720
That lot back there might be
distracted by a few free drinks...

16:02.639 --> 16:04.425
...but I believe you're assisting
in the management

16:04.450 --> 16:06.220
of a brothel, Mr Dale.

16:06.940 --> 16:08.394
I also believe you're doing it

16:08.395 --> 16:10.720
with the willing cooperation
of Mr Simpson.

16:11.213 --> 16:12.213
Prove it.

16:18.488 --> 16:20.719
On your feet.
I need this place searching.

16:20.720 --> 16:21.720
What, now?

16:21.721 --> 16:24.719
No, tomorrow, Larry! Get the punters out.

16:24.720 --> 16:25.720
Shut the club.

16:27.445 --> 16:28.518
The club's closing. Police orders.

16:28.519 --> 16:30.719
- Not a word. Not a word.
- Switch the music off.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.100
Open the safe.

16:32.720 --> 16:33.720
I need everyone to get out now.

16:33.721 --> 16:35.720
- Open it.
- This club's closing.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.940
This club's closing.
I need everybody out!

16:41.720 --> 16:43.720
Everybody out, please,
the club's closing. Everybody out.

16:58.720 --> 17:00.920
I don't remember what I said to her.

17:03.060 --> 17:05.079
I probably talked about my own problems

17:05.079 --> 17:06.720
rather than listening to hers.

17:09.579 --> 17:10.940
I'm sorry. I...

17:11.720 --> 17:13.720
I hate this.

17:14.412 --> 17:16.734
I hate who I've become.

17:17.030 --> 17:18.720
I hate this!

17:20.720 --> 17:21.900
Self-pity?

17:23.306 --> 17:26.694
You're wallowing. Actually,
you're doing worse than that.

17:26.720 --> 17:29.323
You've convinced yourself
you're thinking about this girl

17:29.324 --> 17:31.140
when actually,
you're thinking about yourself.

17:32.020 --> 17:33.540
A little harsh?

17:34.240 --> 17:35.719
A little bit.

17:36.380 --> 17:38.129
You think you're not good enough.

17:38.130 --> 17:39.919
I haven't been for a long time.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.079
- So be better.
- That easy?

17:42.080 --> 17:44.719
You have everything at your disposal.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.719
You're a man. You're white.

17:46.720 --> 17:49.294
You could recite a grocery list
and people would listen.

17:49.295 --> 17:50.720
Well, how do I make amends?

17:51.180 --> 17:53.079
You didn't help this girl.

17:53.460 --> 17:55.719
But there are other girls, right?

17:56.100 --> 17:58.720
So help them.

18:01.646 --> 18:05.260
Always a little black book. Why is that?

18:05.720 --> 18:10.220
Says in here you made payments
of ten pounds every week. What for?

18:10.720 --> 18:11.987
Bar tab.

18:11.988 --> 18:14.920
You own the place. Why do you need a tab?

18:16.720 --> 18:19.719
Yeah, you don't own it at all, do you?

18:19.720 --> 18:21.500
You're the monkey.

18:22.720 --> 18:26.719
- Someone else is the organ grinder.
- That is a spurious accusation.

18:27.060 --> 18:28.920
Were these payments for prostitutes?

18:30.720 --> 18:31.720
I don't need to remind you

18:31.721 --> 18:34.020
that lying to a policeman
is a serious offence.

18:37.386 --> 18:39.425
I have, on occasion...

18:40.260 --> 18:42.719
procured the company of certain ladies.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.314
Sadie Parker?

18:44.315 --> 18:46.500
- My wife doesn't know.
- I bet she doesn't.

18:47.420 --> 18:49.720
When did you last "procure" her company?

18:51.493 --> 18:52.493
Last night.

18:54.640 --> 18:59.639
She came to my office.
We were having a... pleasant time.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.719
- And suddenly she loses her temper.
- Why?

19:03.112 --> 19:04.152
No idea.

19:05.413 --> 19:06.893
I thought we had something special.

19:08.060 --> 19:10.560
Rather... tender.

19:12.146 --> 19:13.946
I had you down as a clever man.

19:18.953 --> 19:21.113
Who do you work for, Mr Simpson?

19:26.400 --> 19:28.260
The girls are starting to talk.

19:29.020 --> 19:30.313
I doubt they'll hold back

19:30.314 --> 19:31.931
when they learn what you did
to one of their own.

19:31.932 --> 19:34.020
- That's conjecture.
- No!

19:34.252 --> 19:35.740
That's certitude.

19:37.140 --> 19:40.240
Simpson's selling those slums
the girls are living in.

19:41.506 --> 19:42.865
Why are you going after the landlord?

19:42.890 --> 19:45.529
He knows more than he's letting on.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.719
- What? About the girl?
- About all of it.

19:47.720 --> 19:51.140
There's someone above him.
Someone else is running the show.

19:52.586 --> 19:55.129
You're one of those coppers. Ha ha!

19:55.154 --> 19:58.289
- A moral crusader.
- You make it sound like a failing.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.719
It's not just black and white, is it?

20:00.720 --> 20:02.719
There'll always be cops,
there'll always be robbers...

20:02.720 --> 20:04.720
It'll always be black and white to me.

20:09.720 --> 20:11.580
What if they don't want my help?

20:12.127 --> 20:13.127
They probably won't.

20:13.721 --> 20:15.720
That's reassuring.

20:23.720 --> 20:26.720
Please, stop!

20:27.720 --> 20:30.217
Come here, come here. Who's been talking?

20:30.218 --> 20:31.720
No-one!

20:33.160 --> 20:36.719
- There are kids in there, Rory!
- Get out of it.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.719
Stay away. Stay away!

20:38.720 --> 20:40.339
Leave them.

20:50.720 --> 20:53.720
He said leave them.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.120
Success.

21:22.480 --> 21:25.417
We don't need charity.
What're you doing here? Just go.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.120
Why don't I put the door back up,

21:27.121 --> 21:28.523
so you have something to slam
in our face?

21:28.524 --> 21:31.119
Don't waste your time.
He'll just do it again.

21:31.120 --> 21:33.120
So we'll put bolts on them.

21:37.120 --> 21:40.119
No offence, lady,
but the last thing we need

21:40.120 --> 21:42.119
is an uptight, bible-loving bitch
telling us

21:42.120 --> 21:44.857
that Jesus will save our souls.
He hasn't saved us yet,

21:44.858 --> 21:47.340
and I'm pretty certain
he ain't gonna save us now, so...

21:48.120 --> 21:50.119
Any glasses that aren't smashed

21:50.120 --> 21:54.160
or is this bible-loving bitch gonna
have to drink from the bottle?

22:00.020 --> 22:03.710
We need a present that conveys
to Sidney that we appreciate him.

22:03.711 --> 22:05.120
We've got some lovely stock in.

22:05.121 --> 22:07.852
Mr Hobbs has a very good eye.

22:07.853 --> 22:11.119
It also needs to say that it's time
to knuckle down,

22:11.120 --> 22:13.420
put this silliness behind him.

22:14.120 --> 22:17.119
Something work related, like a pen.

22:17.120 --> 22:20.507
No, I think something frivolous.

22:20.508 --> 22:23.772
- His life is all frivolity, Leonard.
- Frivolity borne of pain.

22:23.773 --> 22:25.319
Still frivolity.

22:25.320 --> 22:29.159
So, it needs to convey appreciation
and friendship,

22:29.160 --> 22:33.483
but also duty and a little bit
of telling off.

22:33.484 --> 22:35.119
Exactly.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.479
And if it were under three bob,
that would be marvellous.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.159
Cufflinks, maybe?

22:40.160 --> 22:44.119
Will you stop making a fuss of him?
He's just having one of his moments.

22:44.120 --> 22:45.906
No. I think it's more than that.

22:45.907 --> 22:48.120
- I fear for him.
- We both do.

22:52.120 --> 22:56.159
We protest, they beat us,
but we get up and we protest again.

22:56.740 --> 22:59.159
And next time, there are more of us.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.119
Maybe we should protest.

23:01.120 --> 23:03.861
Against what? Being poor?

23:03.862 --> 23:05.622
No-one gives a damn about us.

23:05.623 --> 23:07.159
No-one gives a damn about us!

23:07.500 --> 23:09.500
But we shout anyway.

23:10.120 --> 23:12.119
Being silent gets you nowhere.

23:12.120 --> 23:14.120
Tell that to Sadie.

23:15.120 --> 23:16.780
Did she say something?

23:19.460 --> 23:21.798
They're moving us out of here.
Selling the place.

23:21.799 --> 23:23.640
And Sadie wouldn't stand for it?

23:26.932 --> 23:28.472
What did she say?

23:28.473 --> 23:30.881
That we were worth more
than how they treat us.

23:30.882 --> 23:35.119
- You are.
- We got a job. Roof over our heads.

23:35.120 --> 23:38.451
That's more than most.
You don't know anything, lady.

23:38.452 --> 23:41.120
Look at her, Ava. Course she knows.

23:43.320 --> 23:45.060
I've got a question!

23:46.120 --> 23:48.260
Have you two done the deed?

23:50.340 --> 23:52.119
You have, ain't ya?

23:52.120 --> 23:53.630
Vicar!

23:53.631 --> 23:57.119
- You're making him blush.
- I'm not blushing.

23:57.120 --> 23:59.119
Was he any good?

23:59.120 --> 24:02.120
OK, now I am blushing.

24:25.193 --> 24:28.672
It was thrown on the ashes.
Someone was trying to get rid of it.

24:28.697 --> 24:30.217
And she was wearing it when you met her?

24:33.120 --> 24:34.120
You forgiven me yet?

24:35.527 --> 24:37.527
I always do, don't I?

24:41.926 --> 24:43.285
You know they're selling the place?

24:43.310 --> 24:46.949
Sadie knew, too. I think she made
her feelings pretty clear.

24:46.974 --> 24:49.610
She finds out they're getting
evicted, there's a struggle.

24:49.635 --> 24:52.536
- It has to be Simpson.
- I'm not so sure.

24:52.561 --> 24:53.654
Damn.

24:53.679 --> 24:56.460
No, no, this is good. This is good.
We're getting somewhere.

24:58.973 --> 25:00.653
You are all right, aren't you, Sidney?

25:01.686 --> 25:03.365
You'd tell me if you weren't.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.120
Of course I'd tell you.

25:06.533 --> 25:09.532
So Simpson claims he has no idea
what they were arguing about?

25:10.120 --> 25:11.660
That's what he claims.

25:14.320 --> 25:17.120
It all starts here.

25:18.120 --> 25:20.322
Where were you when you
had intercourse with Miss Parker?

25:20.323 --> 25:22.319
There is a lady present.

25:22.660 --> 25:26.120
We can do this here or at home...

25:26.986 --> 25:28.506
...in front of your wife.

25:37.480 --> 25:40.120
We, erm...

25:47.120 --> 25:50.119
You're all class, Mr Simpson.

25:50.120 --> 25:52.119
So, you have sex.

25:52.120 --> 25:54.584
I phone for a taxi, I come back...

25:54.609 --> 25:55.928
And she was angry.

25:55.953 --> 25:56.953
Screaming.

25:56.978 --> 25:58.620
Have you no heart?

25:59.120 --> 26:00.772
You disgust me. Do you know that?

26:00.773 --> 26:02.192
I hate your guts! I hate the lot of you.

26:02.193 --> 26:03.740
Like a banshee.

26:15.019 --> 26:16.379
'He gave me this.'

26:18.120 --> 26:20.120
I thought I must be special.

26:22.120 --> 26:23.120
Geordie.

26:31.980 --> 26:35.120
Different girls,
all with the same necklace.

26:36.120 --> 26:37.639
Your golfing chum.

26:37.640 --> 26:39.319
The councillor.

26:39.320 --> 26:41.119
Archer Davis is a fine man.

26:41.120 --> 26:43.380
Forgive us if we don't take
your word on that.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.120
This wasn't just about the eviction.

26:46.121 --> 26:48.500
She realised she was being taken
for a mug.

26:48.525 --> 26:50.524
No. She realised they all were.

26:51.493 --> 26:52.693
He's the monkey.

26:53.859 --> 26:56.100
And that's our organ grinder,
right there.

27:02.620 --> 27:04.639
Had quite a few girlfriends.

27:04.640 --> 27:06.808
If you had the chance, don't tell me
you wouldn't do the same.

27:06.809 --> 27:09.119
- Do you pay them for sex?
- I don't need to pay.

27:09.120 --> 27:12.140
- Natural charm see you through?
- I suppose it must do.

27:13.120 --> 27:15.119
Did you know Sadie was being evicted?

27:15.120 --> 27:16.867
Progress is progress, isn't it?

27:16.868 --> 27:17.967
What do you mean by that?

27:17.968 --> 27:21.120
Decent homes for all.
That's our stance at the council.

27:22.906 --> 27:24.745
The council's buying those slums?

27:24.770 --> 27:25.929
That's correct.

27:26.260 --> 27:27.959
From Mr Simpson?

27:27.960 --> 27:29.120
That's correct.

27:34.540 --> 27:36.899
- You not gonna let me in on the joke?
- Oh, you're a clever, clever man.

27:36.924 --> 27:39.883
I'd take that as a compliment, but
I don't think you meant it as one.

27:39.908 --> 27:43.747
You own the club, the girls.
You own those slums. Dirty money.

27:43.772 --> 27:45.931
But you make it clean again
by selling it back to the council.

27:45.956 --> 27:48.611
You really have me down
as a master criminal.

27:48.636 --> 27:51.500
More than that.
I have you down as a murderer.

27:52.613 --> 27:55.932
I think Sadie stood up to you.
And you weren't having it.

27:56.540 --> 27:58.119
Got any evidence to back that up?

27:58.120 --> 27:59.120
No...

27:59.121 --> 28:01.120
cos there won't be any, will there?

28:02.960 --> 28:05.120
You'll have made damn sure of that.

28:06.120 --> 28:10.159
Are you honestly trying to link me
to the death of a prostitute?

28:10.160 --> 28:12.640
A prostitute you were having
a relationship with.

28:13.559 --> 28:17.558
Listen, I ended it with Sadie.
Bit of a jealous type, clingy.

28:17.583 --> 28:20.422
Get bored of her, did you?
Bored enough to kill her?

28:20.693 --> 28:22.852
- You're not gonna let it go, are you?
- Why did you do it?

28:23.120 --> 28:24.120
Warning to the other girls?

28:24.121 --> 28:25.521
I was home in bed with my wife...

28:25.522 --> 28:28.829
Sadie starts mouthing off.
One girl starts, they all start.

28:28.830 --> 28:30.120
I was home with my wife.

28:30.121 --> 28:32.716
You've gotta keep them down,
under control. Did you kill her?

28:32.717 --> 28:34.120
- No.
- Did you kill her?

28:34.121 --> 28:35.603
No!

28:35.628 --> 28:37.144
What?!

28:38.120 --> 28:41.120
All right, fella. How are you?

28:43.679 --> 28:44.839
Guv.

28:49.960 --> 28:52.119
- What?
- There's a chap here.

28:52.120 --> 28:55.580
Says he wants to cop to everything.
Prostitution, all of it.

29:03.620 --> 29:05.120
I surrender.

29:06.846 --> 29:09.940
So not Rupert Simpson,
not Archer Davis...

29:10.640 --> 29:12.119
you run the show.

29:12.420 --> 29:14.100
Who's Archer Davis?

29:14.566 --> 29:17.565
How much did they pay you to come
in here and cop to it all, hm?

29:17.590 --> 29:19.220
Enough to see you through prison?

29:19.779 --> 29:21.978
A few quid extra to make it sound
convincing?

29:22.320 --> 29:25.119
You have entirely the wrong opinion
of me, Officer.

29:25.120 --> 29:28.480
The girl got shirty with Archer
and he made a warning of her.

29:30.053 --> 29:31.533
I'm right, aren't I?

29:33.120 --> 29:34.340
I'm right.

29:35.480 --> 29:38.119
I don't want to talk any more.

29:38.120 --> 29:40.120
Be a pal and show me to my cell.

29:44.120 --> 29:45.540
There won't be a funeral.

29:45.793 --> 29:48.792
They'll put her in an unmarked grave
with the murderers and the vagrants.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.180
Won't even be a stone to remember her by.

29:51.205 --> 29:53.684
As long as you're here,
she'll be remembered.

29:54.120 --> 29:55.479
And how long will that be?

29:55.480 --> 29:57.660
We're all of us
going to an unmarked grave.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.480
Samuel Ford,

30:00.120 --> 30:02.119
Amelia Evans,

30:02.120 --> 30:04.119
Elijah Parr,

30:04.120 --> 30:05.780
James Brooke,

30:06.780 --> 30:08.800
Charles Todd.

30:09.926 --> 30:10.926
Who are they?

30:12.167 --> 30:14.140
Everyone I've lost to violence.

30:14.766 --> 30:18.140
Unless they kill me, too,
I'll keep remembering.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.860
And I'll keep fighting.

30:23.120 --> 30:24.420
Thank you.

30:25.013 --> 30:26.212
For what?

30:26.237 --> 30:29.556
Inspiring me. Showing me the right path.

30:29.581 --> 30:32.260
- You're already on it.
- Maybe.

30:32.799 --> 30:34.799
You underestimate yourself, Sidney.

30:39.540 --> 30:41.120
Stay.

30:45.060 --> 30:46.060
Stay with me.

30:47.120 --> 30:49.447
This was never forever.
We both knew that.

30:49.448 --> 30:50.795
- Why can't it be?
- Sidney...

30:50.796 --> 30:53.119
I don't care what people think
or what they say...

30:53.120 --> 30:55.119
- I have to go home.
- No, you don't.

30:55.120 --> 30:59.951
This, everything here, is nothing
compared to what I see every day.

30:59.952 --> 31:01.159
I have to go back.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.860
You could help here, too.

31:04.666 --> 31:06.820
This is not my world, Sidney.

31:20.120 --> 31:22.960
It's just a walk. It ain't gonna kill ya.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.120
See ya, doll.

31:33.320 --> 31:35.420
Rory didn't come and pick us up.

31:35.900 --> 31:37.220
But you're going anyway.

31:37.593 --> 31:39.593
Like lemmings falling off a cliff.

31:40.986 --> 31:42.665
You're institutionalised.

31:42.690 --> 31:44.010
Sounds painful.

31:45.740 --> 31:47.480
You can't see a way out.

31:48.953 --> 31:50.060
You're trapped.

31:52.699 --> 31:54.859
She dump you, did she?

31:58.592 --> 31:59.912
Come on.

32:02.120 --> 32:04.120
On your feet, soldier.

32:12.120 --> 32:13.542
I met Sadie.

32:13.543 --> 32:15.780
I know. She told us.

32:16.913 --> 32:18.432
What did she say?

32:18.457 --> 32:20.456
That she met a handsome vicar.

32:20.640 --> 32:22.120
That he was kind to her...

32:23.120 --> 32:25.119
...told her God was on her side.

32:25.120 --> 32:29.120
God wants you to be happy,
so rejoice always!

32:30.120 --> 32:31.460
I like that.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.319
You gave Sadie a bit of hope.

32:35.060 --> 32:37.119
For the smallest of moments.

32:37.620 --> 32:38.780
I hope so.

32:40.326 --> 32:42.686
Always surprises me.

32:44.120 --> 32:47.120
That there are still good men out there.

32:48.120 --> 32:51.300
She must be off her rocker...

32:53.480 --> 32:55.180
...to let go of you.

33:03.006 --> 33:05.005
I'm flattered, but...

33:05.420 --> 33:09.120
Flattered?! You're such a sweetie.

33:11.032 --> 33:12.220
You gave Sadie hope.

33:14.420 --> 33:16.120
Don't forget that.

33:37.120 --> 33:39.120
See you next week.

33:42.806 --> 33:44.806
Had a change of heart, have you?

33:55.480 --> 33:58.120
Your ring punctured Sadie's neck.

34:02.960 --> 34:05.120
I really did like her, you know.

34:06.600 --> 34:07.600
I know.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.699
She was a lovely girl.

34:10.120 --> 34:14.119
Ava Holmes, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Sadie Parker.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.119
You do not have to say anything,

34:16.120 --> 34:18.721
but anything you do say
will be written down

34:18.722 --> 34:20.480
and may be used in evidence.

34:35.375 --> 34:36.414
Hello, lovely.

34:36.980 --> 34:39.054
Do you need a light?

34:41.375 --> 34:42.739
If you need me...

34:43.739 --> 34:45.373
come to Grantchester.

34:45.375 --> 34:47.574
- Really?
- Of course.

34:48.701 --> 34:49.701
What's your name?

34:51.967 --> 34:52.967
Sidney Chambers.

34:53.540 --> 34:55.373
Sadie Parker.

34:55.375 --> 34:57.374
Thank you for the light...

34:57.375 --> 34:59.060
Sadie Parker.

35:10.375 --> 35:12.374
What's that word you used?

35:12.375 --> 35:14.375
Institutionalised.

35:14.941 --> 35:16.781
Sadie never was.

35:23.074 --> 35:24.420
She saw these.

35:25.375 --> 35:26.574
Did she tell you?

35:26.575 --> 35:28.380
She told everyone.

35:28.994 --> 35:30.993
Then she told Archer what for...

35:31.375 --> 35:33.072
'in front of his mates from the council.'

35:33.097 --> 35:36.096
Don't believe a word he says.
It's all lies.

35:36.121 --> 35:37.351
Sweetheart. Come on. Not now.

35:37.376 --> 35:39.935
He's not a good man. He whores us out.

35:39.936 --> 35:42.231
- Get her out of here.
- He uses us and then throws us away.

35:42.232 --> 35:46.065
- Get her out.
- We're his whores! We're his whores!

35:46.066 --> 35:49.575
She humiliated him.
It was gonna come back on all of us.

35:50.981 --> 35:51.981
'I gotta tell someone.'

35:52.006 --> 35:53.587
We've got to tell someone, Ava.

35:53.612 --> 35:55.030
Let me go!

35:57.841 --> 36:01.840
Get out of the way, Ava.
Let me go, Ava! Let me go!

36:04.375 --> 36:06.374
No...

36:13.375 --> 36:15.374
Did Archer tell you to keep her quiet?

36:15.375 --> 36:16.735
No-one did.

36:20.375 --> 36:22.375
That makes it worse somehow, doesn't it?

36:23.655 --> 36:25.100
And the other girls?

36:26.375 --> 36:28.020
They weren't in on it.

36:31.767 --> 36:33.500
It was all me.

36:37.308 --> 36:39.340
Fear's a funny thing, isn't it?

36:41.415 --> 36:43.420
It makes you feel like...

36:44.634 --> 36:45.794
...there's no way out.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.980
As we remember Sadie in this place,

36:53.660 --> 36:57.375
hold before us our beginning
and our ending...

36:58.375 --> 37:03.374
...the dust from which we come
and the death to which we move.

37:03.780 --> 37:06.374
In Jesus Christ our Lord.

37:06.375 --> 37:07.620
Amen.

37:09.180 --> 37:12.374
'Amazing Grace'

37:12.375 --> 37:14.435
Don't think badly of Ava.

37:14.436 --> 37:15.740
I don't.

37:16.247 --> 37:17.766
She's not an evil girl.

37:17.895 --> 37:19.374
She couldn't see a way out.

37:19.375 --> 37:21.777
- Sadie saw a way out.
- And she died for it.

37:21.778 --> 37:23.375
Sadie was just one voice.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.574
I'm just one voice.

37:27.735 --> 37:31.375
You know there'll always be
another Sadie, another Ava.

37:33.188 --> 37:36.188
If no-one stands up to them,
this carries on.

37:41.081 --> 37:43.081
Look after each other.

37:47.215 --> 37:48.375
Vicar!

38:12.834 --> 38:14.833
Archer runs it all.

38:15.375 --> 38:18.375
It's not in his name, but it's all his.

38:22.034 --> 38:25.033
He hurts us. He enjoys it.

38:25.375 --> 38:27.220
He breaks us one by one.

38:27.827 --> 38:31.827
It'll be her word against his.
It's one woman's testimony.

38:47.927 --> 38:48.927
Archer Davis?

38:51.301 --> 38:52.380
Not here.

38:53.014 --> 38:56.374
I'm arresting you on suspicion
of earning money from prostitution.

38:57.835 --> 39:00.834
You have the right to remain silent,
but anything you do say

39:00.859 --> 39:03.859
will be written down
and may be used in evidence.

39:16.375 --> 39:17.460
You're going.

39:17.894 --> 39:19.213
Tomorrow.

39:19.375 --> 39:20.734
Don't say it.

39:20.735 --> 39:22.100
I wouldn't dare.

39:27.735 --> 39:29.580
I'm a better man for meeting you.

39:29.928 --> 39:32.300
You were far better than you realised.

40:01.160 --> 40:02.920
- I'll come with you.
- Sidney...

40:02.945 --> 40:05.345
- This isn't your world, I know that.
- Sidney, please...

40:05.375 --> 40:08.374
But it's not mine any more, either,
not without you.

40:08.399 --> 40:09.996
I'll come with you.

40:10.021 --> 40:12.176
- You don't understand.
- We can help people.

40:12.201 --> 40:13.920
We could do so much good.

40:13.945 --> 40:15.517
You could get arrested for being with me.

40:15.542 --> 40:16.649
I don't care.

40:18.074 --> 40:19.074
You'll be hated.

40:19.376 --> 40:20.415
I don't care.

40:21.375 --> 40:23.060
I love you, Violet.

40:26.375 --> 40:27.620
If you're with me...

40:27.645 --> 40:30.645
You love me, too, don't you?

40:32.375 --> 40:33.575
Of course.

40:35.048 --> 40:36.048
Of course I do.

40:37.375 --> 40:39.375
But you have to be sure.

40:40.375 --> 40:42.260
You have to be sure.

41:07.154 --> 41:09.153
We've been here before.

41:09.178 --> 41:11.177
This time it's not just about a girl.

41:12.100 --> 41:14.374
It is always about a girl.

41:14.375 --> 41:16.374
This time it's about God.

41:16.375 --> 41:18.574
It's about doing God's work.

41:18.575 --> 41:21.374
We can't lose him, Geordie.

41:21.375 --> 41:23.374
We're not gonna lose him.

41:23.375 --> 41:25.375
You're the only one he'll listen to.

41:27.934 --> 41:29.453
They want you to talk me out of it.

41:29.478 --> 41:30.957
Got a whole speech planned.

41:30.982 --> 41:33.542
Does it say I'm throwing my life away?

41:33.575 --> 41:35.374
That's my opening argument.

41:35.375 --> 41:38.374
How I'm making a stupid,
reckless mistake?

41:38.375 --> 41:40.375
Yep. All of that.

41:42.654 --> 41:45.134
You know I value your opinion
above everybody.

41:48.041 --> 41:50.041
I need to do this.

41:51.375 --> 41:54.375
And I need to know
that I have your blessing.

41:55.375 --> 41:56.375
Do you love her?

41:58.094 --> 41:59.774
Oh, God, yes.

42:01.995 --> 42:03.995
Sidney Chambers, happy...

42:05.587 --> 42:07.060
Who'd have thought?

42:15.215 --> 42:19.375
It's terrifying to step outside
the bounds of our lives...

42:21.997 --> 42:24.375
...to step away from those we love...

42:25.820 --> 42:28.735
...from the friends we cherish.

42:31.174 --> 42:33.174
But sometimes we must.

42:35.215 --> 42:39.375
Sometimes God has a different path
for us.

42:40.415 --> 42:46.375
One that feels impossible because
we must leave so much behind.

42:49.375 --> 42:52.375
One that makes us feel alone.

42:55.375 --> 42:56.980
But know this...

43:03.415 --> 43:05.575
...we are never alone.

43:09.380 --> 43:11.500
On our path through life...

43:13.067 --> 43:15.427
...God is always by our side.

43:41.054 --> 43:43.053
Maybe I'll come and visit.

43:43.078 --> 43:46.078
Do that. Bring the kids.

43:58.895 --> 44:01.054
Ah, you sod!

44:01.055 --> 44:02.734
I didn't get you anything.

44:02.735 --> 44:04.375
I can't take it with me, so...

44:23.288 --> 44:25.420
You're still trying
to make me a better man?

44:28.114 --> 44:29.114
Always.

44:46.267 --> 44:47.940
One last game, Sidney?

44:53.375 --> 44:55.375
One last game.
