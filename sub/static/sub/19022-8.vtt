00:00.835 --> 00:02.758
Previously on Six...

00:04.240 --> 00:06.837
- Muttaqi did this.
- He can't be everywhere.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.562
We'll find him and we'll put him down.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.443
I wanna go home. No...

00:12.165 --> 00:14.483
What the fuck?

00:14.486 --> 00:16.158
He was working for Muttaqi.

00:16.160 --> 00:18.367
I won't do another op with you ever.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.198
To my brothers on SEAL Team Six,

00:22.200 --> 00:24.438
look inside your hearts.

00:24.440 --> 00:28.470
It's not... too late.
I am proof of that.

00:29.282 --> 00:31.078
All I know is death.

00:31.080 --> 00:33.798
Everything I see,
everything I touch.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.558
I don't think we should have a child.

00:35.560 --> 00:37.798
Look, it is all of us.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.958
You wanna gel' Rip
and those girls,

00:39.960 --> 00:41.758
it's first light.

00:41.760 --> 00:43.598
Another daytime hit.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.318
You will bring Rip and those girls back.

00:45.320 --> 00:47.118
That's why you're team leader, brother.

00:47.120 --> 00:49.238
You were right about the Oregon girl.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.758
How are you, Marissa?

00:50.760 --> 00:53.798
Kashif tells me you're ready
for some more responsibility.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.038
Boko Haram doesn't want our
money. They want your head.

00:56.040 --> 00:58.838
You wanted to sacrifice yourself
for the cause. This is your chance.

00:58.840 --> 01:02.708
Muttaqi is stuck in the past.
We're the future. Help me.

01:07.011 --> 01:09.078
Delta, we're gonna air-land on the X,

01:09.080 --> 01:11.456
move toward our primary entry point.

Aah!

03:47.120 --> 03:50.249
Akmal! Akmal!

04:02.240 --> 04:03.287
We've got movement.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.518
Four men, armed,

04:05.520 --> 04:07.758
and seven female hostages.

04:07.760 --> 04:08.838
No visual on Taggart.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.318
Looks like Nasry's in the back.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.998
All right, put it on the box.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.106
How far out is the assault force?

04:16.760 --> 04:18.398
One minute!

04:18.399 --> 04:21.529
One minute! One minute! One minute!

04:34.516 --> 04:36.118
We have to hurry. Get the truck and go.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.158
- Where's Taggart?
- Forget him. Let's go.

04:38.161 --> 04:39.440
I cannot leave without the SEAL.

04:39.442 --> 04:41.206
You know that better than anyone.

04:43.163 --> 04:44.494
I am the Emir now.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.278
I am the Emir now!

05:02.640 --> 05:05.689
Everyone inside.

05:05.692 --> 05:07.531
_

05:09.555 --> 05:11.838
What the hell is happening? Do we abort?

05:11.840 --> 05:13.438
No, we need to get in there now.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.478
This is the only shot we're gonna get.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.398
Update the assault force.

05:19.440 --> 05:24.238
The teacher and the girls
are at the door with Nasry.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.398
We got no visual on Rip.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.398
We assault through the bay doors.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.278
This is a hostage rescue.

05:30.280 --> 05:33.329
Watch your shots. Watch your shots.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.158
I'm gonna get the SEAL.

06:13.160 --> 06:15.118
We can't have him at our backs.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.918
We need you here. They're coming.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.558
Michael.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.318
You've trained the men well, brother.

06:20.320 --> 06:22.729
Kill as many Americans as you can.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.918
Farooq, Aziz!

06:27.920 --> 06:29.998
I promise this will be over soon,

06:30.000 --> 06:32.844
one way or another.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.170

09:02.720 --> 09:05.478
Bravo One, preparing f0
breach at primary entry.

You're gonna be all right.
Stay with him. Stay with him.

10:15.360 --> 10:17.478
Be strong, girls.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.408
His rifle's gone.

10:32.723 --> 10:36.078
Akmal! He's coming to you!
He's coming for the girls!

10:37.560 --> 10:39.318

13:25.140 --> 13:27.258
Michael, we're
about to be overrun.

13:27.261 --> 13:30.158
We get to the hostages
before the Americans do.

13:30.160 --> 13:32.208
It's the only card we have left.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.565
Go, go. Go! Go! Go.

All right, we just have to
get to that door, get outside.

16:37.018 --> 16:38.838
We're not getting out of here, Michael.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.398
The time for talking is
over. Today is the day we die.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.758
Remember your village. Remember Layla.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.158
- I am.
- That was the deal!

Save the girls! That's what you want!

I want you to run and I
want you to keep running.

other side of that door.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.558
It's okay. It's okay.

19:18.560 --> 19:21.238
You're gonna be okay now, all right?

19:21.240 --> 19:23.402
You're gonna be okay.

19:41.960 --> 19:43.041
NODs.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.729
Hold 'em off!

21:19.760 --> 21:22.358
The perimeter's secure!

21:43.120 --> 21:44.724
Hey.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.798
We gotta get you out of here, Rip.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.870
Tell me about the girls.

21:49.873 --> 21:52.035
They're fine. Bear's got 'em.

21:54.520 --> 21:56.118
You were there.

21:56.120 --> 21:59.198
My brother begged for his life.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.009
I won't.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.678
Shoot him.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.478
I already did.

22:07.480 --> 22:08.558
Move, move!

22:08.560 --> 22:10.289
Chase, get the door.

22:11.320 --> 22:12.638
You look like shit.

22:14.320 --> 22:17.438
In here!

22:17.440 --> 22:19.878
Take this piece of shit to the helo.

22:19.880 --> 22:23.118
Come on. Let's get Rip out
of here. Come on! Let's go.

22:23.120 --> 22:24.718
All stations, we have Taggart.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.438
Yeah!

22:26.440 --> 22:27.680
Say again.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.918
- We have Taggart.
- Good work, boys.

22:30.920 --> 22:32.598
Let's bring him home.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.758
Repeat, that is affirmative.
We have Taggart.

22:39.760 --> 22:42.278
He's being evac'ed south
side of the building.

22:42.280 --> 22:44.718
Delta One copies. They got Rip.

22:44.720 --> 22:46.878
Oh, thank you.

22:46.880 --> 22:49.167
Let's go. Go! Go!

22:52.720 --> 22:54.609
Let's go.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.558
We're flying you and the girls

22:59.560 --> 23:01.598
back to a base outside of Lagos.

23:01.600 --> 23:05.158
Your families will be
waiting for you there. Okay.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.118
Can you just... Can you
give me a moment, please?

23:07.120 --> 23:09.930
All right.

23:11.708 --> 23:12.914
Is Richard all right?

23:15.080 --> 23:17.768
Yeah. Yeah, he's doing okay.

23:19.941 --> 23:23.548
Can you please tell him I said...

23:24.640 --> 23:27.238
Tell him thank you for everything.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.638
Will you tell him that?

23:29.640 --> 23:32.518
Yeah. I will.

23:32.520 --> 23:34.918
God bless you, my friend.

23:34.920 --> 23:36.126
And you.

23:41.840 --> 23:44.878
- All right?
- It's time to go, ma 'am.

23:44.880 --> 23:46.198
You're good.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.438
- Thank you.
- You're good.

23:48.440 --> 23:49.965
All right.

24:08.360 --> 24:09.998
He's fine.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.398
They've got him ready for transport.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.811
Okay.

24:19.680 --> 24:21.887
Had to be you guys, huh?

24:23.480 --> 24:25.084
Had to be.

24:27.960 --> 24:29.485
How's your daughter?

24:30.823 --> 24:32.632
Did you name her Sarah?

24:35.320 --> 24:36.810
Yeah.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.568
Yeah, we did.

24:42.640 --> 24:44.165
It's good to see you, man.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.643
Ma'am.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.118
In sports,

25:49.120 --> 25:51.398
NASCAR provisionals
have been set,

25:51.400 --> 25:55.398
with the top three teams all
receiving two spots each.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.478
And for the second straight year,

25:57.480 --> 26:01.201
there was no eligible driver
for the champions spot.

26:15.228 --> 26:16.559
Lena?

26:22.922 --> 26:24.287
Lena?

27:21.560 --> 27:22.800
Hey.

27:24.160 --> 27:26.158
We did it.

27:26.160 --> 27:28.353
We brought Rip and the girls back home.

27:30.480 --> 27:33.006
- I'm so proud of you, baby.
- Yeah?

27:34.000 --> 27:37.318
Told you. I told you.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.798
- I told you I'd take care of it, right?
- Yeah.

27:39.800 --> 27:42.485
'Cause that's what I do. I fix things.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.838
Oh, my God. You're gonna make me fall.

27:48.840 --> 27:51.078
- Yeah?
- Wait, I gotta tell you something.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.558
What? My mother.

27:53.560 --> 27:55.158
What about your mother?

27:55.160 --> 27:57.998
You need to change the
mattress in the spare room.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.198
It's lumpy. I don't know how you
think anyone can sleep in there.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.998
- I needed the help.
- It's fine.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.967
I mean, your morn is
visiting. That's okay.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.998
Hey, we got Rip back, so now I
can take that contracting job.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.318
Anabel's not going to that
fancy dance school anymore.

28:12.320 --> 28:15.478
And you can quit your job, and everything
is gonna be just like it was before.

28:15.480 --> 28:17.678
I'm not quitting my job, Ricky.

28:17.680 --> 28:20.518
And I'm not visiting. I'm moving in.

28:20.520 --> 28:24.798
I like what I'm doing.
I like this part of me.

28:24.800 --> 28:27.371
And I don't think you
should leave the team.

28:31.359 --> 28:32.678
I have to get back to work.

28:32.680 --> 28:37.118
Hey, let's, um, let's
throw a party for Rip. Okay?

28:37.120 --> 28:40.203
Close your mouth. Bugs will fly in.

28:46.480 --> 28:47.925
So why am I here?

28:48.920 --> 28:50.251
What do you see?

28:51.520 --> 28:52.601
Water.

28:54.720 --> 28:58.318
You gotta look at where the
wave breaks, how it moves.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.004
Does it crash or does it crumble?

29:04.080 --> 29:06.998
Saw what you did. It's
been all over the news.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.758
That was you guys, right?

29:12.800 --> 29:15.918
- It's pretty cool.
- Oh, yeah?

29:15.920 --> 29:17.598
Those girls back with their families?

29:17.600 --> 29:19.489
Yeah.

29:22.080 --> 29:25.368
So... what's gonna happen to Rip?

29:27.371 --> 29:29.260
I don't think he ever
thought he'd come home.

29:31.120 --> 29:33.998
The crash and the crumble.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.004
Shit's complicated, Alex.

29:38.040 --> 29:39.451
Yeah, it is.

29:42.320 --> 29:43.481
So now what?

29:45.120 --> 29:46.690
Hit the surf.

29:46.693 --> 29:50.317
_

29:50.320 --> 29:51.838
So what are your plans?

29:51.840 --> 29:54.318
I'm looking at my options.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.998
Well, we all feel for you, Rip.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.478
And I don't even know the
half of what they did to you.

30:01.480 --> 30:03.998
But the hard truth is, now you're back,

30:04.000 --> 30:05.558
there's gonna be some tough questions

30:05.560 --> 30:07.958
about what went down
that night in Afghanistan.

30:07.960 --> 30:10.281
There are no questions 'cause I did it.

30:11.480 --> 30:13.847
But my guys had nothing to
do with it. End of story.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.925
I need to make sure that
we are clear on that.

30:20.050 --> 30:21.620
Are we clear on that, sir?

30:25.680 --> 30:27.198
Yeah.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.361
We're clear.

30:33.240 --> 30:35.798
I don't know what Washington's gonna do.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.238
They could bury you for this.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.958
And you should know that the
command can't protect you.

30:40.960 --> 30:42.998
You just take care of my guys.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.048
I'll take care of myself.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.282
All right, um...

30:53.522 --> 30:54.569
Good luck.

30:56.440 --> 30:57.771
Hmm.

31:00.080 --> 31:02.878
You will meet my mother-in-law.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.678
- Sweet. Is she hot?
- What's her name?

31:04.680 --> 31:06.878
Yeah, yeah, she's perfect
for you, Fishbait, actually.

31:06.880 --> 31:08.158
She might like Malouf.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.198
She really wants to meet Malouf

31:11.840 --> 31:13.958
Why don't you wear your little hat?

31:13.960 --> 31:15.118
Hey!

31:15.120 --> 31:17.238
Ohh!

31:19.880 --> 31:22.118
- Oh!
- Bring it in! Bring it in!

31:22.120 --> 31:23.998
You got fat, bro.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.158
- Whoa!
- What do you think of the place?

31:26.160 --> 31:28.278
I think it still smells like ass.

31:28.280 --> 31:30.798
Well, we still have Fishbait, so...

31:30.800 --> 31:32.278
I'm Chase, by the way.

31:32.280 --> 31:34.558
You're the hard charger
with Buckley's saw.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.278
- It's a real pleasure, man.
- Likewise.

31:37.280 --> 31:40.238
Man, uh, guys are in the Kill
House. You want me to go get 'em?

31:40.240 --> 31:42.598
- You want a beer?
- Uh...

31:42.600 --> 31:44.876
- Hey, hey, we got a mug with your name.
- No, no, no.

31:44.879 --> 31:47.638
I think I've had enough of
small dark spaces for a while.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.728
All right, you're still coming
to the party this weekend, right?

31:49.730 --> 31:52.078
- Jackie still making thatguacannfle?
- Hell, yeah.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.758
I'm in.

31:54.760 --> 31:56.758
- Take care.
- I'll get the boys ready.

31:56.760 --> 31:58.398
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'll meet you down there.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.078
- Hey, man. Good to see you, Fish.
- Welcome back.

32:00.080 --> 32:02.758
- It's good to finally meet you.
- You, too.

32:02.760 --> 32:04.798
- Ah.
- Huh.

32:22.640 --> 32:23.801
How's your side?

32:24.760 --> 32:26.171
They got most of it out.

32:27.600 --> 32:29.278
That's good, man.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.442
- Yeah.
- That's good.

32:36.880 --> 32:39.358
So, uh...

32:39.360 --> 32:40.964
I gotta ask you something.

32:44.160 --> 32:45.571
What?

32:46.520 --> 32:48.718
That video that you made,

32:48.720 --> 32:51.041
those things that you said to us...

32:52.600 --> 32:54.841
Did you mean 'em?

32:56.760 --> 32:59.438
Hey, Bear, do you
know where the, uh...

32:59.440 --> 33:01.238
- I'll give you guys a minute.
- No, no.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.891
No, we're good.

33:07.800 --> 33:09.848
We're good.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.587
Hey.

33:14.840 --> 33:16.118
I'm glad you're home, brother.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.929
Yeah, me, too.

33:20.280 --> 33:22.248
- Catch up with you after?
- Yep.

33:29.343 --> 33:30.549
You look good.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.918
You look like an old man
now, but you look good.

33:33.920 --> 33:36.002
Yeah, well, I feel like an old man.

33:44.320 --> 33:45.446
Thank you.

33:47.560 --> 33:49.369
You were right in Afghanistan.

33:52.680 --> 33:55.758
I don't even know anymore, man.

33:55.760 --> 33:57.364
You were right.

33:58.760 --> 34:00.489
Every word of it.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.126
I should get back to the boys.

34:08.175 --> 34:10.257
That's the job.

34:14.565 --> 34:15.803
Hey, if you're up for it,

34:15.806 --> 34:18.478
you should come down to the house
and get some beach time, man.

34:18.480 --> 34:20.766
I'd really like that.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.078
Mr. Taggart.

34:58.080 --> 35:00.924
I hope you don't mind, but
I'd like to shake your hand.

35:04.320 --> 35:05.958
Sure.

35:05.960 --> 35:08.278
I don't care what
anybody says about you,

35:08.280 --> 35:11.011
I would've killed that raghead, too.

35:12.480 --> 35:13.878
That's taken care of.

35:13.880 --> 35:17.168
If it were up to me, you'd never buy
another meal the rest of your life.

35:30.680 --> 35:31.918
Excuse me.

35:31.920 --> 35:33.158
New details have emerged

35:33.160 --> 35:34.878
about the daring daytime rescue

35:34.880 --> 35:37.278
Of former Navy SEAL
Richard Tagger!

35:37.280 --> 35:39.518
- and the kidnapped girls of Benin City....
- Thank you.

35:39.520 --> 35:42.478
- It's not straight.
- Yes, it is.

35:42.480 --> 35:44.158
The President
called the operation

35:44.160 --> 35:46.398
"a clear message to
America's enemies,"

35:46.400 --> 35:49.478
and lauded the courage
and skill of the rescuers.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.118
The President's talking about Ricardo.

35:52.120 --> 35:54.758
If he had something nice
to say, maybe you can, too.

35:54.760 --> 35:56.838
...continue to climb. Global...

35:56.840 --> 35:59.311
Hey, there's the man of the
house. How you doing, bro?

35:59.314 --> 36:00.632
- Good.
- Yeah?

36:00.635 --> 36:01.998
Uncle Joe's here.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.278
Hey.

36:04.280 --> 36:05.438
Did you talk to Lena?

36:05.440 --> 36:07.329
Of course I have. Have you?

36:09.520 --> 36:11.158
Come on.

36:11.160 --> 36:13.638
Hey! Beermeister has arrived!

36:13.640 --> 36:15.478
And he's brought the Cuervo.

36:15.480 --> 36:18.358
- Welcome, boys.
- Hey, man. Rip here yet?

36:18.360 --> 36:19.438
You beg, you plead,

36:19.440 --> 36:21.958
you get on your knees
and do whatever it takes.

36:21.960 --> 36:23.998
You're giving me marriage advice?

36:24.000 --> 36:26.198
Lena still at her sister's?

36:26.200 --> 36:27.998
- It's temporary.
- She hasn't come back?

36:28.000 --> 36:29.318
It's temporary.

36:29.320 --> 36:30.678
Is that Jackie's mom?

36:30.680 --> 36:32.718
Oh, play nice.

36:32.720 --> 36:34.078
- Stop laughing.
- Be nice.

36:34.080 --> 36:37.438
You better be careful, because pretty
soon, Dharma will be calling you dad.

36:37.440 --> 36:40.078
- Uh, that'll never happen, man.
- Yes, it will.

36:40.080 --> 36:41.958
You forgot the cheese.

36:41.960 --> 36:43.518
I forgot the cheese.

36:43.520 --> 36:44.998
So you're at Oceanside?

36:45.000 --> 36:47.798
- Go, Raiders.
- How are the classes?

36:47.800 --> 36:50.598
- How are the boys?
- Mm. They're boys.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.638
- I date college guys.
- You what?

36:52.640 --> 36:54.158
Well, not date-date.

36:54.160 --> 36:56.049
Not technically.

36:59.120 --> 37:00.678
Wanna try an e-cig?

37:00.680 --> 37:03.047
- Welcome.
- Hey.

37:04.480 --> 37:06.598
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.718
- Mm.
- Mm.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.158
How are you?

37:10.160 --> 37:11.478
Looks like a good party.

37:11.480 --> 37:14.006
- Yeah. I'm glad you came.
- Yeah, thanks.

37:17.600 --> 37:20.001
I'm gonna go get some ice.

37:29.800 --> 37:31.558
I left you some messages.

37:31.560 --> 37:33.611
I'm happy for you.

37:33.614 --> 37:35.689
I know how important
this all was to you.

37:40.120 --> 37:41.918
When you coming home?

37:41.920 --> 37:45.358
Joe, not now. I'm
here to see my friends.

37:45.360 --> 37:47.408
Yeah, I know. Yeah, I know.

37:48.803 --> 37:50.407
Look, I want you to know that...

37:51.560 --> 37:52.641
I'm ready.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.678
Okay? I'll do whatever it takes.

37:55.680 --> 37:57.718
I'll do all Of it,

37:57.720 --> 38:01.202
the operation, whatever.

38:05.954 --> 38:08.002
I think I need some time.

38:11.400 --> 38:12.811
Yeah.

38:13.920 --> 38:17.558
I'm just gonna go get a beer.

38:17.560 --> 38:19.638
- Okay.
- All right.

38:19.640 --> 38:22.371
Mm.

38:23.240 --> 38:24.478
Hey.

38:26.040 --> 38:28.008
How'd it go?

38:30.880 --> 38:33.121
Yeah. Yeah, good.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.808
Thanks, man.

38:40.640 --> 38:43.038
Well... you got a lot of work to do.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.328
I know.

38:50.440 --> 38:52.678
He's just sitting there.

38:52.680 --> 38:54.558
Yep.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.164
I'll go get him.

39:03.120 --> 39:05.009
It's hot out here.

39:06.407 --> 39:07.758
You coming in or what?

39:07.760 --> 39:09.603
Amigo.

39:11.767 --> 39:13.718
Atkins said you might be getting out,

39:13.720 --> 39:16.362
working for some
fancy contractor.

39:17.526 --> 39:20.038
I don't know, man. Maybe. Come on.

39:20.040 --> 39:21.758
Come on.

39:21.760 --> 39:24.078
You in a suit? I'd pay to see that.

39:24.080 --> 39:26.558
Do you even own a suit?

39:29.269 --> 39:31.249
Come on, asshole.
Everybody's here for you.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.051
Yeah.

39:37.280 --> 39:40.518
Yeah, I think, um, I think
