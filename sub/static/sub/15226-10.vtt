01:22.448 --> 01:23.782
Phew! Hi, everybody!

01:23.816 --> 01:25.016
ALEX:
Hi.
         Hello, Elaine.

01:25.050 --> 01:26.684
I have no time
                  to talk today.

01:26.719 --> 01:28.353
Hey, hey, hey,
what's the big rush?

01:28.421 --> 01:30.488
Oh, I've got an opening
      at the art gallery.

01:30.522 --> 01:32.891
And my last fare
  wouldn't get out of the cab.

01:32.925 --> 01:34.091
He kept flirting with me.

01:34.126 --> 01:36.227
You know, uh, telling me
       about his Porsche,

01:36.261 --> 01:39.130
his stock investments, his plans
    to scale Mount Everest.

01:39.164 --> 01:40.698
Every trick in the book.

01:40.733 --> 01:42.534
Well, why didn't you just
   throw him out of the cab?

01:42.568 --> 01:44.369
And let him get away?

01:44.437 --> 01:46.304
Well, you didn't make a date
    with this guy, did you?

01:46.339 --> 01:47.672
No, not a date.

01:47.706 --> 01:50.542
Just dinner tomorrow night.

01:50.576 --> 01:54.578
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
  to go make myself exquisite.

02:02.254 --> 02:05.190
(as Vic):
             Hey, working class.

02:05.224 --> 02:09.026
Well, if it isn't...
Mr. Personalities.

02:09.061 --> 02:10.895
What is new?

02:10.930 --> 02:12.697
Oh.

02:12.699 --> 02:14.733
Great question.

02:14.767 --> 02:17.535
I'm thinking
    about taking up jogging.

02:17.569 --> 02:20.772
Hey, the granola man is
     into physical culture.

02:22.274 --> 02:23.475
Forget jogging,
                      my friend.

02:23.509 --> 02:25.042
I've got one
                    word for you

02:25.077 --> 02:28.212
that's gonna make your
        body say <i>merci beaucoup.</i>

02:28.281 --> 02:30.849
Jazzercise.

02:30.883 --> 02:32.384
Jazzercise.

02:32.418 --> 02:33.984
That's right.

02:34.019 --> 02:35.453
Of course.

02:35.488 --> 02:38.857
Tell me about this jazzercise.

02:38.891 --> 02:40.825
Well, it's...

02:43.795 --> 02:46.364
It's exercise to music
               at a health club.

02:46.398 --> 02:48.132
In its purest form,

02:48.167 --> 02:51.269
it's just you
                   and 25 ladies

02:51.303 --> 02:53.404
stretching,

02:53.438 --> 02:57.242
twisting and sweating.

03:02.014 --> 03:03.982
Uh...

03:04.016 --> 03:07.986
how does a fella,

03:08.020 --> 03:12.090
uh, get into this,
        uh, jazzercise?

03:13.659 --> 03:14.625
(clears throat)

03:14.659 --> 03:16.494
Well, I'll tell you, my friend.

03:16.528 --> 03:17.829
You need three things.

03:17.863 --> 03:19.264
First, you need the desire,

03:19.298 --> 03:20.298
and you've got that.
                         Uh-huh.

03:20.332 --> 03:22.433
Then you need a sweat suit,
and you can get that.

03:22.501 --> 03:23.568
And then you need a friend

03:23.602 --> 03:25.803
who's not gonna be embarrassed
to take you with him.

03:25.837 --> 03:27.071
Good luck.

03:27.106 --> 03:28.573
(laughing)
No.

03:28.608 --> 03:30.675
I'm only kidding, Jimbo.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.244
Hey, listen, every man needs
a cause, and you're mine.

03:33.278 --> 03:34.812
How about
tomorrow at 8:00?

03:34.847 --> 03:36.881
(clicks tongue)

03:39.819 --> 03:42.053
I see a vision.

03:42.088 --> 03:43.454
Oh, thanks.

03:43.488 --> 03:46.424
She walks in beauty
like the night.

03:46.459 --> 03:51.695
Of cloudless climes
and starry skies.

03:51.730 --> 03:56.367
Of all that's best
and dark and light

03:56.401 --> 04:00.671
meets in her aspect
         and her eyes.

04:00.706 --> 04:02.907
Thanks.

04:02.941 --> 04:04.809
Hey, Jim, that
                 is really nice.

04:04.843 --> 04:06.277
Where's that from?

04:06.312 --> 04:09.547
Oh, some punk spray-painted it
           on my van.

04:12.685 --> 04:15.520
ALEX:
Elaine?

04:15.588 --> 04:17.387
Uh...
Something bothering you?

04:17.423 --> 04:19.055
Yeah, um,

04:19.091 --> 04:22.125
there's this small hole
above the sink in the bathroom,

04:22.161 --> 04:23.961
you know, just, like,
          large enough

04:23.996 --> 04:25.296
to poke my finger through?

04:25.364 --> 04:26.497
ALEX:
Yeah.

04:26.531 --> 04:28.967
And I know
   this sounds crazy, but...

04:29.001 --> 04:32.270
I thought I saw an eye
    behind it looking at me.

04:32.304 --> 04:33.605
Nah. Come on.

04:33.639 --> 04:36.641
It's probably
 your imagination... or a rat.

04:36.676 --> 04:39.076
Where <i>is</i> Louie?

04:39.111 --> 04:40.444
Now, now, wait a minute,
         wait a minute.

04:40.479 --> 04:41.679
I mean, Louie's a creep,

04:41.714 --> 04:43.047
but I don't think
      he'd sink that low.

04:43.082 --> 04:45.917
¶ A pretty girl

04:45.951 --> 04:49.553
¶ Is like a melody...

04:49.555 --> 04:51.555
Ooh, I am gonna
             pluck his eyes out.

04:51.590 --> 04:53.124
No, no, no, Elaine,
Elaine, Elaine,

04:53.158 --> 04:55.627
you cannot
pluck his eyes out yet.

04:57.596 --> 05:00.230
Without proof, it's just
his word against yours.

05:00.265 --> 05:01.298
You want proof?

05:01.333 --> 05:03.167
I'll give you proof.

05:03.201 --> 05:04.736
You know, maybe
                I'm overdressed.

05:04.770 --> 05:06.070
I think I'll

05:06.105 --> 05:08.306
change back into
           what I had on before.

05:10.376 --> 05:12.710
(humming)

05:15.681 --> 05:17.682
TONY:
                      That's it!

05:17.717 --> 05:19.350
That's it! I'm going in
     there and breaking his jaw.

05:19.385 --> 05:20.518
Tony, now,
look now, look now,

05:20.553 --> 05:21.852
violence may be your way
of handling this,

05:21.887 --> 05:23.621
but I think Elaine
has a plan of her own.

05:23.655 --> 05:24.789
Come on, let's just
let her handle...

05:24.824 --> 05:26.724
(screaming loudly)

05:26.759 --> 05:27.859
You were watching
                      me undress

05:27.893 --> 05:28.926
through that peephole,
                    weren't you?

05:28.961 --> 05:30.194
No, no, no, no, no!

05:30.229 --> 05:31.562
It was your eye
I poked!
              No!

05:31.596 --> 05:33.531
No. How could you accuse
             me of such a thing?

05:33.533 --> 05:34.432
It's absolutely untrue.

05:34.467 --> 05:35.733
ELAINE:
Oh, yeah?

05:35.735 --> 05:37.402
So then, why are
your eyes tearing?

05:37.404 --> 05:38.969
Be... Be...
               Because I'm hurt.

05:39.004 --> 05:40.304
I'm hurt
   that you would even think

05:40.339 --> 05:42.206
that I could do
      such an awful thing.

05:42.208 --> 05:44.308
So, how come
    only one eye is tearing?

05:44.343 --> 05:46.210
Well, it's not the end
         of the world.

05:47.112 --> 05:49.280
If you... If you...

05:49.315 --> 05:51.583
I'll forget
the whole incident.

05:55.287 --> 05:56.887
Louie, I hate you!

05:56.922 --> 05:59.824
I hate you more now than
        I ever hated you before,

05:59.858 --> 06:02.660
and that's saying
                      something!

06:02.695 --> 06:06.630
I'm an innocent man
        falsely accused.

06:06.632 --> 06:07.999
Innocent, huh?

06:08.033 --> 06:09.400
The gall of this man!

06:09.435 --> 06:11.202
What gall? I'm innocent.

06:11.237 --> 06:12.303
We saw you go in.

06:12.337 --> 06:13.871
We know
   there's a peephole there.

06:13.905 --> 06:15.206
We saw you come out,

06:15.240 --> 06:17.575
and your eye is tearing
    because Elaine poked it.

06:17.610 --> 06:20.311
I'm innocent as a lamb.

06:20.345 --> 06:21.779
I... You just...

06:21.814 --> 06:23.014
I... You...

06:23.048 --> 06:24.615
Oh, forget it.

06:24.683 --> 06:25.783
Forget it.

06:25.818 --> 06:28.652
And that goes double
                  for me, Louie.

06:28.687 --> 06:31.222
You know, there aren't
too many do's and don'ts

06:31.256 --> 06:32.990
when it comes to women,

06:33.058 --> 06:38.262
but in Vic's book,
file this under "W" for whoa!

06:38.296 --> 06:40.130
JIM:
Boss,

06:40.132 --> 06:42.900
nobody could want
to believe you more

06:42.934 --> 06:44.668
than I want to believe you.

06:44.703 --> 06:48.506
I've had four heroes
in my life.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.709
Saint Thomas Aquinas,

06:51.744 --> 06:53.711
Mahatma Gandhi,

06:53.746 --> 06:55.780
Alan Alda and you.

06:58.150 --> 06:59.884
Just look me in the eyes

06:59.918 --> 07:02.487
and tell me straight
     that you didn't do it.

07:02.489 --> 07:05.022
I can't look you
               in the eye, Iggy,

07:05.056 --> 07:07.391
because Nardo just stuck
           a finger in this one.

07:07.425 --> 07:08.826
But I didn't do it.

07:08.861 --> 07:10.661
That's good enough for me.

07:20.105 --> 07:23.074
And three, four, five, six.

07:23.108 --> 07:25.209
Hips, hips, hips, hips.

07:25.244 --> 07:27.411
Four, three, two, one.

07:27.445 --> 07:29.613
Rotate, rotate, rotate, rotate.

07:29.648 --> 07:31.783
Buns, buns, buns, buns.

07:31.817 --> 07:34.652
Buns, buns.

07:37.022 --> 07:39.290
There's one word I
              never want to hear

07:39.324 --> 07:41.425
as long as I
              live-- jazzercise.

07:41.459 --> 07:42.593
Oh, come on, man,

07:42.627 --> 07:43.761
get into it.

07:43.796 --> 07:44.929
Hips, hips,
                     hips, hips.

07:44.963 --> 07:46.097
Hey, Vic...

07:46.131 --> 07:47.265
Come on now,
                     one, two...

07:47.299 --> 07:48.900
I'm not a violent man
by nature.

07:48.934 --> 07:50.101
Hey, all right.
(mumbles)

07:50.135 --> 07:52.003
I'm sorry, sorry.

07:53.472 --> 07:57.208
Guys... this is
Andrea Stewart

07:57.242 --> 07:58.742
from the National
Organization for Women.

07:58.777 --> 08:00.144
TONY:
                         Oh, hi.

08:00.179 --> 08:01.746
She's here to settle up
the score for me with Louie.

08:01.780 --> 08:02.914
Hello there.
Hi.

08:02.948 --> 08:04.115
Maybe, Elaine.

08:04.149 --> 08:05.817
Look, you know
               I'm on your side,

08:05.851 --> 08:08.686
but that's why I just
             feel it's important
            to meet Mr. De Palma

08:08.721 --> 08:10.922
and hear his side of the
          story before we get...

08:10.990 --> 08:11.989
Hey, who's the toots?

08:12.023 --> 08:13.258
Louie, Louie,
Louie, Louie!

08:17.229 --> 08:18.829
Hey, I saw her first, Reiger.

08:20.933 --> 08:23.267
What's your
               name, sweetcakes?

08:23.301 --> 08:25.470
May I do this?

08:25.504 --> 08:26.804
Uh, Louie De Palma,

08:26.839 --> 08:29.841
I am pleased to introduce you
to Andrea Stewart.

08:29.875 --> 08:31.208
She's the regional
director

08:31.243 --> 08:34.144
for the National
Organization for Women.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.113
So?

08:36.148 --> 08:38.448
They're here to take
              action against you

08:38.482 --> 08:40.116
for what you
                  did to Elaine.

08:40.152 --> 08:41.318
Fair enough.

08:41.352 --> 08:44.789
Might I suggest
                     a spanking?

08:44.823 --> 08:46.924
I've heard enough.

08:52.932 --> 08:54.065
Louie, Louie, Louie.

08:54.099 --> 08:55.232
You really...

08:55.267 --> 08:56.834
You really did
                   it this time.

08:56.868 --> 08:59.704
The boss is gonna
               come down hard on
               you for this one.

08:59.738 --> 09:01.338
What? Ratledge will laugh
those dames

09:01.372 --> 09:02.907
right out of his office.

09:02.941 --> 09:04.842
I've been
a loyal employee

09:04.877 --> 09:07.745
of this company
         for 15 years.

09:07.779 --> 09:10.381
It's my word against hers.

09:10.482 --> 09:13.318
Against ours.

09:13.352 --> 09:15.553
I don't want to talk
      about this anymore.

09:17.423 --> 09:21.558
Hey, Ton, how would
              you like cab 7-41?

09:21.593 --> 09:24.161
You mean the brand new one
that came in yesterday?

09:24.196 --> 09:26.264
I can't think
                  of a nicer guy

09:26.266 --> 09:28.932
or a better cabbie
                to break her in.

09:28.967 --> 09:31.969
Happy motoring, paisan.

09:32.003 --> 09:33.437
Gee, thanks, Louie.
                           Yeah?

09:33.471 --> 09:34.638
I really appreciate this.

09:34.672 --> 09:36.007
Thanks a lot.
                           Yeah?

09:36.041 --> 09:38.742
You know, I'm still gonna have
to, uh, testify against you.

09:38.777 --> 09:40.177
Give me that!

09:40.212 --> 09:43.281
You got 4-13,
                the widow maker.

09:47.286 --> 09:49.820
Oh.

09:49.855 --> 09:52.022
Wha...?

09:52.057 --> 09:54.024
What's going on up there?

09:54.059 --> 09:56.526
Why are they saying such things?

09:56.561 --> 09:58.262
Iggy, come here.

09:58.296 --> 09:59.597
You heard what's going on?

09:59.631 --> 10:01.298
What'd they say?
        What'd they say?

10:01.300 --> 10:03.234
All I got was bits
       and pieces, boss.

10:03.268 --> 10:04.434
Yeah?

10:04.469 --> 10:05.569
Let me think.

10:05.671 --> 10:08.940
Uh... Uh, women's rights.

10:08.974 --> 10:10.341
Yeah.

10:10.375 --> 10:12.943
Uh, not an easy job.

10:12.978 --> 10:16.714
Uh... 15 years
         loyal service.

10:16.748 --> 10:19.216
Aha! Hmm.

10:19.251 --> 10:21.719
Lawsuit.

10:21.753 --> 10:24.822
Uh, serious charge.

10:24.857 --> 10:27.591
Um... have a coffee?

10:27.625 --> 10:29.693
What else? What else?

10:29.728 --> 10:31.028
Think! Think! Think!

10:31.096 --> 10:33.797
Uh, Sweet 'N Low.

10:36.001 --> 10:38.035
I should be talking
                  to the banana.

10:38.069 --> 10:40.604
Like... give me a chance.

10:40.638 --> 10:43.073
There was something else.

10:43.075 --> 10:45.075
I'll search my mind
for it, boss.

10:45.109 --> 10:46.377
Yeah.

10:46.411 --> 10:48.145
Bring bloodhounds.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.980
(Elaine clears her throat)

10:50.014 --> 10:52.249
Well, well, well, that was fast.
         What happened?

10:52.283 --> 10:53.751
I decided not to sue.

10:53.785 --> 10:56.521
I've agreed to accept
his out-of-court settlement.

10:56.555 --> 10:57.655
(laughs)

10:57.689 --> 10:59.189
I knew it!

10:59.224 --> 11:02.593
The old fire dragon put you
         in your place.

11:02.628 --> 11:04.361
You lost the battle, huh?

11:04.363 --> 11:06.964
No, you lost your job.

11:06.998 --> 11:08.699
(groans)

11:12.237 --> 11:14.172
Oh, yeah, yeah.

11:23.882 --> 11:26.049
So...

11:26.084 --> 11:28.852
good-bye, cockroach.

11:28.887 --> 11:30.922
Good-bye, mouse.

11:30.956 --> 11:32.890
Good-bye, Jeff.

11:34.192 --> 11:36.260
Good-bye, Louie.

11:36.328 --> 11:37.694
We can't let him go

11:37.729 --> 11:39.930
without giving him a good-bye,
         can we, Alex?

11:39.964 --> 11:42.133
It's inexcusable
     what he did to Elaine.

11:42.167 --> 11:44.302
The reign of terror is over.

11:46.137 --> 11:50.374
So why do I feel sorry
for that broken toilet of a man?

11:53.245 --> 11:55.146
Uh, Lou?

11:55.180 --> 11:57.314
What?

12:01.319 --> 12:03.354
Good-bye, Lou.

12:07.292 --> 12:10.093
Oh, yeah?

12:10.095 --> 12:12.697
Well, you can keep
        your good-byes.

12:12.731 --> 12:14.699
You guys had your chance.

12:14.733 --> 12:17.134
You could have stuck up for me,
        but you didn't.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.106
You never liked me,
and I never liked you.

12:22.174 --> 12:25.476
I'm going out there,
     and I'm going to claw,

12:25.511 --> 12:27.378
backstab, lie,

12:27.412 --> 12:30.014
cheat, walk all
                    over people,

12:30.048 --> 12:32.249
do whatever I have to,
               to get to the top

12:32.317 --> 12:35.285
of this dung heap
        we call a life.

12:35.320 --> 12:39.423
And when I get there, I'm going
   to spit on all you losers.

12:41.593 --> 12:44.061
Oh, I miss him already.

12:44.095 --> 12:46.297
(sobbing)

12:51.903 --> 12:53.036
Thanks a lot, Mrs. Brewer.

12:53.071 --> 12:55.406
I really appreciate that
you're taking the kids tonight.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.007
Yeah.
        (knock at door)

12:57.041 --> 12:59.910
Oh, okay, well, um,
I really can't talk to you now.

12:59.944 --> 13:01.111
My date is here.

13:01.145 --> 13:03.046
Okay, bye-bye. Thank you.
        (knock at door)

13:06.117 --> 13:07.585
(knock at door)

13:10.155 --> 13:12.022
Hi.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13:12.057 --> 13:13.056
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.
                          Louie!

13:13.091 --> 13:14.625
Come on, come on, this
           is not going to help.

13:14.659 --> 13:15.692
I'm not going to
                 change my mind.

13:15.727 --> 13:16.894
Please, Nardo.

13:16.929 --> 13:18.095
Please, please.
                     Louie, come
                     on, get up.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.363
No, no, no, no,
this is something

13:19.398 --> 13:20.898
I got to say
to your feet.

13:20.933 --> 13:22.032
Louie, come on.

13:22.066 --> 13:23.434
I have a date due
                here any minute.

13:23.468 --> 13:24.701
I want you
                    out of here.

13:24.736 --> 13:26.503
If you don't listen to me,
I'll kill myself.

13:26.538 --> 13:28.172
I swear I will--
I'll kill myself.

13:28.206 --> 13:29.206
Oh, no, you won't--
                     you are not

13:29.240 --> 13:30.808
the kind of person who
             takes his own life.

13:30.842 --> 13:32.009
Come on, Nardo.
                  Unfortunately.

13:32.044 --> 13:33.410
Come on, Nardo.

13:33.445 --> 13:36.146
Come on, you got to give me
a break here. I mean, what...

13:36.181 --> 13:38.616
what-what-what-what kind of...
 what do you got to lose here?
        (knock at door)

13:38.650 --> 13:40.717
What's it going to cost you?

13:40.752 --> 13:42.353
She'll be with you
                 in two seconds.

13:44.823 --> 13:45.989
Robert?

13:46.023 --> 13:47.224
He didn't give his name.

13:47.258 --> 13:49.326
Oh, get out
                      of my way.

13:52.764 --> 13:55.532
Hi.

13:55.567 --> 13:56.834
(chuckling nervously)

13:56.868 --> 13:58.969
Did I come at a bad time?
                             No.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.370
I'm so embarrassed.

14:00.405 --> 14:02.206
Uh, why don't
                    you come in?

14:03.275 --> 14:05.108
Um...

14:05.143 --> 14:07.011
why don't you
sit down

14:07.045 --> 14:09.713
and, uh, make yourself
comfortable?

14:09.748 --> 14:12.083
Oh, thank you.

14:13.485 --> 14:15.419
They were lovely.

14:20.525 --> 14:21.458
Sit down.

14:21.493 --> 14:22.693
Uh, I'll just be a minute

14:22.728 --> 14:24.428
until I get rid
of this guy, okay?

14:24.462 --> 14:25.896
Who is he?
Uh, that's Louie.

14:25.931 --> 14:28.032
You-you know, the one
I told you about, from work.

14:28.066 --> 14:30.234
I'm sorry, Nardo, I'm sorry!
                    Okay, Louie,
                  it's too late.

14:30.268 --> 14:31.535
It can't be too
                    late, Nardo.

14:31.570 --> 14:32.970
It can't be.
           You don't understand.

14:33.004 --> 14:34.505
Do you know
   where I'm going tomorrow?

14:34.539 --> 14:37.274
I'm going
   to the unemployment line.

14:37.342 --> 14:39.576
I'm going there
with the derelicts,

14:39.611 --> 14:41.611
the washouts,
                    the scuzzos.

14:41.646 --> 14:42.779
(hyperventilating)

14:42.813 --> 14:44.548
That-that... you
               can't understand.

14:44.582 --> 14:47.084
That job meant
               everything to me.

14:47.118 --> 14:48.752
It was my life.

14:48.786 --> 14:50.487
It was... (wheezes)
              it was everything.

14:50.522 --> 14:52.022
Without it,
                  I'm a nothing.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.524
I'm a zero.

14:53.558 --> 14:55.225
I'm...
Louie, you should
have thought

14:55.260 --> 14:57.361
of that before you did
what you did.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.062
What's the matter with him?

14:59.096 --> 15:00.530
It's a ploy--
he's faking.

15:00.565 --> 15:02.166
Where's the head?

15:02.200 --> 15:04.134
I don't want you
in my bathroom.

15:04.169 --> 15:06.136
Oh, yes, you do.

15:06.171 --> 15:07.671
Oh, okay.

15:07.705 --> 15:09.306
All right... no, no,
no, no, Louie, Louie,

15:09.341 --> 15:10.740
Louie, Louie, this...
               it-it's this way,

15:10.776 --> 15:12.043
Come on.

15:15.647 --> 15:18.115
(chuckling)

15:18.149 --> 15:23.086
Robert, you have no idea
   how sorry I am about this.

15:23.121 --> 15:25.189
Well, obviously not
as sorry as he is.

15:25.223 --> 15:27.357
Oh, I know what this
                 must look like,

15:27.426 --> 15:29.392
but it's not.
    What a pathetically sad
          little man.

15:29.427 --> 15:32.629
(laughs)
  He's actually physically ill
      from being so upset.

15:32.631 --> 15:34.631
You don't know who
           you're talking about.

15:34.666 --> 15:37.801
That man is a filthy,
               lecherous monster

15:37.836 --> 15:40.438
who does not deserve
                   our sympathy.

15:40.505 --> 15:42.439
I see.

15:44.108 --> 15:45.509
I don't think so.

15:45.543 --> 15:47.077
You think I'm the
             villain, don't you?

15:47.112 --> 15:49.213
Elaine, I don't think there
     are any villains here.

15:49.247 --> 15:50.080
Oh, yes, there are!

15:50.114 --> 15:51.882
And right now, he's
                in the bathroom,

15:51.917 --> 15:54.251
making himself sick, trying
             to elicit sympathy,

15:54.286 --> 15:56.053
which he is not
                   going to get.

15:56.088 --> 15:57.988
I see.

15:58.023 --> 16:00.290
Robert, you've
              got to understand.

16:00.324 --> 16:02.025
I'm a warm, sensitive
                    human being!

16:02.060 --> 16:03.593
You've got to
                     believe <i>me!</i>

16:03.628 --> 16:05.362
I believe you,
I believe you.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.466
(groaning)

16:11.470 --> 16:12.870
Are you okay?

16:12.971 --> 16:14.505
(panting)

16:14.539 --> 16:16.640
I'm a little
                  weak, but, uh,

16:16.674 --> 16:18.842
considering what I've
              just been through,

16:18.876 --> 16:20.411
I'm not so bad.

16:20.445 --> 16:22.479
Well, why don't you come
over here and sit down?

16:22.514 --> 16:23.780
(sighs)

16:23.815 --> 16:25.482
You know, I'm-I'm sorry
              about the flowers.

16:25.517 --> 16:27.150
Oh, no, no...
                  don't-don't...
They were lovely.

16:27.185 --> 16:28.885
Don't... don't
                      you worry.

16:28.920 --> 16:30.287
Don't worry
                 about that now.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.888
Here, just sit down.

16:31.923 --> 16:33.190
(panting)

16:33.225 --> 16:36.260
Elaine, what is the worst
         thing that could happen

16:36.294 --> 16:38.462
if you gave this
             man another chance?

16:40.999 --> 16:44.935
He's got a good soul.

16:44.970 --> 16:46.903
Louie, I've seen
        this act before.

16:46.938 --> 16:48.706
It's not going
       to work this time.

16:48.740 --> 16:50.307
Well, it's obvious the two of
     you have things to work out

16:50.342 --> 16:52.109
and I'm in the way,
             so I'm going to go.
Oh, no, no, no.

16:52.143 --> 16:53.310
D-don't go, don't go.
No, no, no.

16:53.344 --> 16:55.345
If you go, she'll just
       take it out on me.

16:55.380 --> 16:56.981
No, Robert,
you don't really have to leave.

16:57.049 --> 16:59.282
I-I-I think I-I
           better go now. I-I...
  N-no, no, no ,no.

16:59.317 --> 17:01.285
I'll... I'll call you.
        No, no, no, no,
        Robert, Robert.

17:01.319 --> 17:03.620
No, Bobby, Bobby,
            Bobby, please don't.

17:03.622 --> 17:04.421
Don't go, don't go.

17:04.455 --> 17:05.723
You can't leave her like this.

17:05.757 --> 17:07.424
I mean, it's not her fault!

17:07.526 --> 17:09.693
That jerk.

17:09.727 --> 17:11.161
Good riddance.

17:11.194 --> 17:12.663
You're better off
without him.

17:13.897 --> 17:17.101
Do you have any idea
how much I hate you right now?!

17:17.169 --> 17:18.435
What are you talking about?

17:18.469 --> 17:19.837
I tried to keep him here.

17:19.871 --> 17:20.904
You heard me.

17:20.938 --> 17:22.906
Hey, I'm the one he liked.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.311
There is nothing more
         to say to you.

17:28.346 --> 17:30.280
Just get out!

17:41.359 --> 17:43.694
I can't open this door, Nardo.

17:43.795 --> 17:44.961
Don't you understand?

17:44.996 --> 17:47.097
I can't leave here
without my job!

17:47.131 --> 17:48.432
I can't, I can't!

17:48.466 --> 17:50.167
I... can't.

17:55.306 --> 17:58.475
You never quit, do you, Louie?

18:01.078 --> 18:02.613
Sorry.

18:02.647 --> 18:03.680
I'm sorry.

18:03.715 --> 18:05.248
Louie, can I get you anything?

18:06.351 --> 18:08.385
Well, if it's not
       too much trouble,

18:08.419 --> 18:10.520
some weak tea and my job back.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.156
Louie.

18:14.059 --> 18:16.593
How can you see me
        suffer like this, Nardo?

18:16.627 --> 18:18.595
I mean, don't you
                   have a heart?

18:18.629 --> 18:20.597
I keep telling you I'm sorry.

18:20.632 --> 18:22.465
Why can't you forgive me?

18:22.500 --> 18:24.768
Because you're not really sorry.

18:24.802 --> 18:27.303
Because you don't
        even understand

18:27.338 --> 18:29.305
what was wrong
       with what you did.

18:32.910 --> 18:34.678
You mean...

18:34.713 --> 18:38.648
if I understood what was
          wrong with what I did,

18:38.683 --> 18:40.984
then you'd forgive me
        and give me my job back?

18:41.019 --> 18:42.686
But you won't
understand.
              But what if I did?

18:42.721 --> 18:43.987
But you won't.
                  What if I did?

18:44.022 --> 18:45.388
What if I did?
But you...

18:45.423 --> 18:48.158
Yes... but you'll never
          understand.

18:48.226 --> 18:48.993
I will!

18:49.094 --> 18:50.527
I'll understand.

18:50.562 --> 18:53.663
(sighs) It-it's wrong...

18:53.698 --> 18:56.233
because...

18:56.267 --> 18:57.768
(laughs)

18:57.802 --> 19:00.938
It's... it's wrong
   because we're not supposed

19:00.972 --> 19:03.540
to peek at girls
   without their clothes on.

19:03.575 --> 19:04.741
(laughs)

19:04.776 --> 19:06.043
And she...

19:06.077 --> 19:08.411
she thought I wouldn't
          know why it was wrong!

19:08.446 --> 19:09.813
(laughing)

19:09.847 --> 19:10.948
Yeah.

19:10.982 --> 19:12.515
I think Ratledge
                        is home.

19:12.550 --> 19:14.951
I'll get him
                        for you.

19:14.986 --> 19:16.420
No.

19:16.454 --> 19:17.955
No?

19:17.989 --> 19:19.556
No.

19:21.226 --> 19:23.961
See, I'm not looking
      for any pat answers.

19:23.995 --> 19:26.296
Wha-wha-wha-wha...
         But, you know,
   in a way, I-I'm-I'm hoping

19:26.330 --> 19:29.466
that you really understand this,
because I'd like to forgive you.

19:29.568 --> 19:30.935
And I'd like to be forgiven.

19:30.969 --> 19:32.303
What's holding us up?

19:33.805 --> 19:35.472
Me?

19:35.506 --> 19:37.507
(groans)

19:40.778 --> 19:43.013
Object! Object!

19:43.048 --> 19:44.548
I was treating you
                 like an object.

19:44.582 --> 19:46.583
I was treating you
           like a sexual object,

19:46.617 --> 19:48.718
like somebody without
              a head or nothing.

19:48.753 --> 19:53.123
Thank God I watched
that Donahue show about broads.

19:53.158 --> 19:55.025
I'll get Ratledge
              for you right now.

19:55.060 --> 19:56.160
Louie, get out.

19:56.194 --> 19:57.894
Get out of my apartment,
get out

19:57.896 --> 19:58.762
of my life!

19:58.797 --> 20:00.497
But-but... God, God!

20:00.531 --> 20:02.599
It's wrong
  because God doesn't like it.

20:02.633 --> 20:04.267
No, no, no, no.

20:04.301 --> 20:05.736
God likes it?

20:05.770 --> 20:06.803
Well, help me.

20:06.837 --> 20:07.937
Uh, meet me halfway.

20:07.972 --> 20:09.806
Give me a hint.
              All right, I will.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.808
Oh!

20:11.842 --> 20:15.479
Louie, has there ever been
           a moment in your life

20:15.513 --> 20:17.981
when your most basic,
               fundamental right

20:18.015 --> 20:20.450
as a human being
              has been violated?

20:20.485 --> 20:22.486
Your right to privacy?

20:22.520 --> 20:24.788
I'm sorry I violated
your right to privacy.

20:24.823 --> 20:27.190
No, it's not just repeating
               what I just said!

20:27.259 --> 20:28.892
I'm sorry I repeated
      what you just said.

20:28.926 --> 20:30.226
Louie, think
for a second.

20:30.261 --> 20:31.628
I can't-- I'm
                    too nervous.

20:31.630 --> 20:33.330
Have you ever been violated?

20:37.102 --> 20:38.402
Yes.

20:38.470 --> 20:39.303
When?

20:39.404 --> 20:41.171
What do you want, a story?

20:41.205 --> 20:42.939
Yes, I do.

20:46.844 --> 20:48.379
Okay.

20:53.518 --> 20:55.452
Uh...

20:59.790 --> 21:01.291
Uh..

21:01.426 --> 21:02.726
twice a year...

21:02.760 --> 21:04.628
(mumbles indistinctly)

21:04.662 --> 21:08.098
What?

21:08.100 --> 21:12.102
Twice a year, I...
 I have to go get new clothes,

21:12.136 --> 21:14.637
and, uh, I, uh...

21:18.209 --> 21:21.844
the only way that I can...

21:21.879 --> 21:25.582
the only way I can get anything
      to fit me is, uh...

21:27.552 --> 21:31.055
I have to go
     to, uh, a men's store

21:31.089 --> 21:35.526
and walk straight
    to the boys' department

21:35.593 --> 21:38.628
and ask if...

21:38.662 --> 21:41.898
they have anything
      in the husky sizes.

21:41.932 --> 21:44.901
Huskies-- I hate them.

21:46.871 --> 21:48.238
I, um...

21:49.540 --> 21:52.408
I don't... I usually

21:52.443 --> 21:54.878
will try to go
when there's nobody there.

21:54.912 --> 21:58.749
I... I go during
school hours.

21:58.783 --> 22:01.118
But no matter
when I go,

22:01.152 --> 22:03.686
the place
is crawling with kids.

22:03.721 --> 22:06.957
And, uh... I don't even look
at what I'm getting.

22:06.991 --> 22:10.160
I just go over
to the rack, take it off,

22:10.195 --> 22:13.896
my size, and I rush
into the dressing booth.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.801
The last time...

22:17.835 --> 22:20.703
(sighs)
   one of the mothers said...

22:24.742 --> 22:26.676
"You're lucky.

22:26.710 --> 22:30.613
At least you won't outgrow it
        in six months."

22:35.052 --> 22:36.954
Did you say anything to her?

22:36.988 --> 22:39.089
I mooned her.

22:46.931 --> 22:49.299
But the...

22:49.334 --> 22:52.869
the worst moment...

22:55.039 --> 22:57.907
is when you got to...

22:57.942 --> 23:00.677
push open those doors...

23:01.679 --> 23:04.581
and walk out
into that room...

23:06.317 --> 23:08.786
wearing your new
corduroys,

23:08.820 --> 23:10.754
making that noise.

23:10.789 --> 23:13.557
(mimicking chafing sound)

23:18.529 --> 23:21.531
And then,
all the parents

23:21.565 --> 23:25.502
tell their kids...
not to stare.

23:32.810 --> 23:36.380
Is that the way I made you feel
         when I peeked?

23:39.217 --> 23:41.151
Kind of.

23:45.089 --> 23:47.791
God, I'm sorry.

23:47.826 --> 23:49.559
(chuckles softly)

23:49.594 --> 23:51.294
(crying)

23:51.329 --> 23:52.862
It's okay.

24:05.710 --> 24:08.177
(theme song playing)

24:31.336 --> 24:32.836
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

24:32.870 --> 24:33.837
(man grumbling)
