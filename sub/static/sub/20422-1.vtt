00:10.930 --> 00:12.990
Up the tempo, and whittle down his health!

00:16.670 --> 00:19.370
Defeating him and solving the 
problem are different things.

00:23.870 --> 00:25.580
<i>Fortress Stance!</i>

00:26.070 --> 00:30.630
Time to see what my new 
shield and armor can do!

00:31.060 --> 00:34.300
Wish strongly, and keep thinking 
to make it come true.

00:34.750 --> 00:37.140
Continue to train, without giving up.

00:37.590 --> 00:40.140
These are the lessons we must hand down.

00:40.740 --> 00:42.030
Hurry!

00:42.030 --> 00:43.770
Shiroe's team will lead the attack!

00:44.810 --> 00:46.380
Nice! Nice!

00:46.380 --> 00:48.600
500 dogs is a lucky sign!

00:48.600 --> 00:51.820
You can't get this excitement in real life!

00:52.430 --> 00:53.700
Stupid.

00:53.700 --> 00:56.410
William, defeat the enemy!

00:57.880 --> 01:00.950
The bigger the pinch you overcome,

01:01.520 --> 01:03.960
the better the food tastes after!

02:38.050 --> 02:40.760
Do you guys love pumpkins?

02:41.890 --> 02:43.450

02:43.450 --> 02:47.100
We swear on our guild master's glasses 
and Takayama's "good work" card

02:47.100 --> 02:48.640
that we will win!

02:54.090 --> 02:57.640
You're on the planning committee. 
You stay here and work.

02:59.530 --> 03:03.530
No! I want to play tug-of-war, too!

03:03.850 --> 03:09.540
<b>Shiroe of the Northern Lands</b>

03:04.970 --> 03:06.550
Shiroe of the Northern Lands.

03:09.540 --> 03:11.790
<b>After-Halloween Planning Committee</b>

03:11.270 --> 03:15.320
By the way, why "After-Halloween"?

03:15.720 --> 03:17.550
Remember the Halloween event?

03:17.980 --> 03:19.530
Indeed.

03:19.950 --> 03:22.470
The one held during the last three days of October,

03:22.470 --> 03:27.180
where monsters drop pumpkins when defeated, yes?

03:27.470 --> 03:31.250
So, since we ended up with too many pumpkins,

03:31.250 --> 03:33.940
we decided to do something with them as a prize.

03:34.740 --> 03:37.180
Marielle the strategist thinks of everything!

03:37.180 --> 03:38.940
Air glasses?

03:40.240 --> 03:41.490
But still...

03:42.400 --> 03:45.330
Akihabara has become so peaceful.

03:46.070 --> 03:47.180
That's right.

03:47.730 --> 03:50.710
We were suddenly sent to a world 
exactly like a video game,

03:51.140 --> 03:53.040
and we decided we had to do something,

03:53.040 --> 03:55.000
so we founded the Round Table.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.840
There were all kinds of things we'd never 
get to experience in real life.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.930
Everyone truly worked hard.

04:06.420 --> 04:07.730
Including Serara.

04:07.730 --> 04:09.430
Using your hands is against the rules!

04:09.720 --> 04:12.440
And if you drop the bun, you pay for it!

04:15.210 --> 04:17.880
<i>Win and have a pumpkin party with Nyanta!</i>

04:17.990 --> 04:21.030
<i>Win and have a pumpkin party with Nyanta!</i>

04:21.520 --> 04:23.410
And Tohya and Minori.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.120
Tohya, don't just fling it as hard as you can!

04:26.540 --> 04:29.000
You need to watch how the phantoms move!

04:29.000 --> 04:29.620
Roger!

04:30.190 --> 04:32.500
Okay, leave it to me!

04:32.840 --> 04:35.390
And Isuzu and Rudy.

04:33.790 --> 04:35.390
Everyone ready?

04:37.120 --> 04:40.450
In the face of teamwork like ours,

04:40.450 --> 04:44.510
a race where we have to 
synchronize our timing is nothing.

04:42.490 --> 04:43.670
Set!

04:44.510 --> 04:47.210
Hey, it's already started!

04:47.210 --> 04:48.140
What?!

04:54.750 --> 04:57.760
So, this is the obstacle course?

04:57.760 --> 04:58.760
Nice fight!

04:58.760 --> 05:00.240
Way to go, Akatsuki!

05:00.240 --> 05:00.940
She's amazing!

05:01.960 --> 05:04.760
In first place is Akatsuki, from Log Horizon!

05:05.910 --> 05:08.470
I'll win this fight, my lord.

05:08.470 --> 05:10.830
Akatsuki!

05:11.730 --> 05:12.940
You're awesome!

05:12.940 --> 05:14.220
Congrats!

05:16.870 --> 05:19.690
I wish little Shiro and the rest could've participated.

05:19.690 --> 05:21.710
It can't be helped.

05:21.710 --> 05:24.830
There's still a lot to do.

05:34.410 --> 05:36.060
I know that, but...

05:36.810 --> 05:38.270
They're still Royal Guards, right?

05:38.270 --> 05:44.570
The Royal Guard only attacks adventurers 
when they fight in a no-combat zone.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.660
That's true, but...

05:47.870 --> 05:50.460
Shiroe is late.

05:50.460 --> 05:53.080
I wonder if the negotiations aren't going well.

05:53.370 --> 05:56.010
They haven't gone well from the start.

05:56.010 --> 05:58.080
How many times have we come here?

05:59.440 --> 06:01.090
The Kunie Clan...

06:01.610 --> 06:08.040
Aren't they the clan that controls the banks? 
The flow of money in this world?

06:08.670 --> 06:10.550
It isn't only the banks.

06:10.550 --> 06:13.220
They control the Royal Guard 
system and all the lifelines.

06:13.850 --> 06:18.550
Supposedly, they also maintain the barriers 
that keep monsters out of towns.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.810
You're sure it's impossible?

06:25.650 --> 06:28.490
It goes against an ancient treaty.

06:31.270 --> 06:35.000
Then, could we arrange 
financing from the Kunie Clan?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.170
Unlikely.

06:37.130 --> 06:40.180
As you all know, the Round Table

06:40.180 --> 06:44.190
has purchased the Guild Building, 
Cathedral, Trade Building,

06:44.710 --> 06:48.010
and several other facilities around the city.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.370
We do this to ensure that they 
will not fall into enemy hands.

06:52.810 --> 06:53.630
But...

06:54.260 --> 06:56.530
The costs are incredible.

06:56.530 --> 07:00.020
It all runs ten million gold a month.

07:00.420 --> 07:05.400
Wasn't the cost of this building five million gold?

07:05.860 --> 07:08.530
We're paying twice that a month?

07:08.800 --> 07:13.530
Well, it's obvious that the Round 
Table is going to go broke.

07:14.530 --> 07:17.410
We won't be able to do festivals 
or athletic meets anymore.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.950
We have bigger problems than that.

07:19.950 --> 07:21.340
Have you told the rest of the town?

07:21.880 --> 07:22.790
Not yet.

07:23.550 --> 07:28.050
Right now, it isn't a good idea for the 
Round Table to show weakness.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.550
You're concerned about the South?

07:30.930 --> 07:32.800
Plant Hwyaden...

07:33.190 --> 07:35.810
There are rumors about them in town.

07:36.400 --> 07:40.060
This Plant Hwyaden guild is running 
a dictatorship in the South, right?

07:40.060 --> 07:42.150
But it sounds like it's going well.

07:42.150 --> 07:44.320
I've got a friend in the South.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.150
He contacts me now and then.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.020
I won't say that a dictatorship is always evil, but...

07:49.590 --> 07:53.830
Crusty and Isaac aren't here now, either.

07:54.750 --> 07:59.460

<i>The adventurers of Akihabara won

<i>and began an invasion of the main

<i>and Karashin and Akaneya went to

an immediate threat.

08:28.220 --> 08:30.320
So what do you intend to do?

08:35.330 --> 08:38.380
Thank you for waiting, everyone!

08:38.380 --> 08:42.230
Tonight, we'll be having Nyanta's 
special pumpkin feast!

08:43.780 --> 08:45.230
It's good, but...

08:45.230 --> 08:48.010
It's literally nothing but pumpkins.

08:48.010 --> 08:50.760
Chief, I want some meat...

08:50.760 --> 08:53.450
Pumpkins are full of nutrients.

08:53.450 --> 08:56.410
And they warm your body, too.

08:56.410 --> 08:59.630
Don't be a picky eater. Please eat them.

08:59.630 --> 09:01.020
No, um...

09:01.020 --> 09:02.520
Meat!

09:02.520 --> 09:03.770
<b>Tenth-Place Prize</b>

09:04.250 --> 09:08.280

09:08.280 --> 09:10.610
I think it's amazing that we got tenth place.

09:10.610 --> 09:12.650
So what's that, Minori?

09:13.290 --> 09:17.210
Some guy I've never seen said it was a 
participation prize, and insisted I take it.

09:17.210 --> 09:18.410
That's really scary!

09:19.630 --> 09:21.370
That's a goat-slime doll!

09:21.370 --> 09:25.470
Oh, is that one of those creepy-cute 
items I've heard about?

09:25.470 --> 09:28.420
I don't understand what guys like.

09:28.920 --> 09:34.840
In that sense, you're more mature... Calmer, sort of.

09:30.950 --> 09:33.670
I see... It didn't work out, huh?

09:33.670 --> 09:35.430
Then what's Shiroe doing?

09:36.460 --> 09:40.990
Minori, come to think of it, I didn't 
see Shiroe at today's festival.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.430
Yeah, it looks like he's busy with work.

09:47.380 --> 09:50.940
I think his bad habit might be coming back.

09:52.840 --> 09:56.240
<i>I guess it's the only way.</i>

09:59.290 --> 10:03.130
Now, give this memento to our guild master!

10:03.130 --> 10:04.180
That's right!

10:04.180 --> 10:05.470
No, don't...

10:06.400 --> 10:07.690
Oh, Shiroe!

10:07.690 --> 10:08.470
Done working, huh?

10:08.470 --> 10:09.850
Yeah... Hi.

10:09.850 --> 10:10.960
My lord...

10:11.540 --> 10:12.440
Look at this.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.460
It was our tenth-place prize.

10:13.460 --> 10:15.970
O-Oh... It's amazing, yeah.

10:16.580 --> 10:18.970
Shiroe, here. I'm sure you're tired.

10:19.930 --> 10:21.350
Thanks, Minori.

10:21.700 --> 10:24.050
Is your work really hard?

10:24.050 --> 10:25.600
Yeah, sort of.

10:26.550 --> 10:29.260
So, there's something I want to tell you all.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.090
Shiro, what did you just say?

10:35.090 --> 10:36.360
Well, like I said...

10:38.000 --> 10:39.860
I'm planning to leave Akihabara.

10:41.780 --> 10:43.130
Impossible!

Nothing to report.

11:08.370 --> 11:10.560
Some snow, a little wind.

11:11.140 --> 11:12.290
I see.

11:12.290 --> 11:13.130
Thanks.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.070
Sure.

11:18.280 --> 11:19.190
Thanks.

11:21.330 --> 11:25.100
Well? Don't you think you can tell me now?

11:26.600 --> 11:28.410
It's been ten days since then.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.170
Leave Akihabara?

11:31.770 --> 11:33.820
What do you mean, Shiroe?

11:34.600 --> 11:40.430
I haven't told you all, but Akihabara 
has a problem right now.

11:42.990 --> 11:44.640
I can't tell you the details.

11:44.640 --> 11:47.780
But I think it's the only way 
to solve this problem.

11:49.370 --> 11:50.640
My lord...

11:51.190 --> 11:53.720
Then where are you going?

11:53.720 --> 11:55.070
I can't tell you that, either.

11:55.070 --> 11:59.650
I wish you'd trust us more, guild master.

12:00.250 --> 12:04.660
There's a possibility that there are 
Southern spies in Akihabara.

12:05.070 --> 12:09.240
You don't know where information might leak.

12:09.240 --> 12:10.190
Exactly.

12:10.190 --> 12:11.160
I see.

12:11.760 --> 12:13.850
We need to keep our lips zipped.

12:13.850 --> 12:15.920
What will you tell the Round Table?

12:16.570 --> 12:20.670
I plan to tell Crusty, Isaac, and Soujirou.

12:21.190 --> 12:25.490
We believe in you, Shiroe.

12:26.870 --> 12:28.190
Thanks.

12:28.850 --> 12:31.660
And so, Naotsugu, while I'm gone—

12:30.680 --> 12:31.660
Nope!

12:33.250 --> 12:35.180
A pitcher needs a catcher.

12:35.180 --> 12:36.940
An enchanter needs a guardian.

12:37.860 --> 12:39.440
I'm going with you.

12:40.990 --> 12:42.070
My lord!

12:42.930 --> 12:44.820
I-I'll go, too.

12:44.820 --> 12:46.720
You stay here in Akihabara, Akatsuki.

12:50.110 --> 12:52.820
I need to ask a favor that only you can do.

12:55.920 --> 12:59.380
So, if you need money, why are 
we in these snowy mountains?

12:59.910 --> 13:02.540
We can't get it by normal methods.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.420
It's a little too much.

13:05.420 --> 13:06.780
A little?

13:06.780 --> 13:10.020
In all, about eighty trillion.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.000
E-Eighty trillion?!

13:13.000 --> 13:14.110
Yeah.

13:14.830 --> 13:17.850
Even if we got every gold piece owned 
by every adventurer in the world,

13:17.850 --> 13:20.010
it probably wouldn't be enough.

13:20.010 --> 13:24.030
Do you really need all that 
for Akihabara's facilities?

13:27.740 --> 13:31.290
Um... Excuse me, Shiroe?

13:32.000 --> 13:34.620
Your guest is here.

13:34.620 --> 13:36.540
Why are you half-hidden?

13:39.640 --> 13:41.550
Is it all right if I say it's been a while?

13:42.080 --> 13:44.050
That's fine with me.

13:44.550 --> 13:46.270
This is Regan,

13:46.760 --> 13:48.400
the Sage of Miral Lake.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.930
Do you know who he is?

13:50.310 --> 13:53.800
<i>You see his name all the time in flavor text, but...</i>

13:53.800 --> 13:55.940
<i>I never knew he was such a dull-looking old man.</i>

13:56.550 --> 13:58.380
<i>I still can't believe it.</i>

13:58.380 --> 13:59.940
Yes, of course.

14:00.630 --> 14:03.590
I am the Kunie Clan's representative.

14:03.590 --> 14:05.200
My name is Kinjou.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.800
Hello, hello.

14:07.800 --> 14:11.800
I'm honored to meet a member of the Kunie Clan.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.220
The honor is mine.

14:13.610 --> 14:17.360
The representative of the adventurers, 
the great mage Shiroe,

14:17.360 --> 14:20.040
and Regan, the Sage of Miral Lake.

14:20.710 --> 14:22.710
Even our great ancestors

14:22.710 --> 14:25.550
would never have imagined 
a meeting such as this.

14:25.910 --> 14:33.100
This wonderful meeting is enhanced 
even further by your presence.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.590
The Kunie Clan...

14:34.590 --> 14:39.010
A mysterious race that carries on the 
technology of a magical civilization.

14:39.010 --> 14:42.410
My heart swells with expectation!

14:42.410 --> 14:43.570
Expectation?

14:43.770 --> 14:45.110
Yes.

14:45.110 --> 14:47.950
Shiroe is, after all, a man full of surprises.

14:48.310 --> 14:50.700
Oh? I am pleased to hear it.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.740
I called you here for an important reason.

14:55.740 --> 14:57.840
You need money.

14:58.440 --> 14:59.830
Financing.

15:00.140 --> 15:01.220
Yes.

15:01.220 --> 15:03.350
I told you this in Akihabara, but...

15:03.350 --> 15:06.340
You chose this place for our meeting

15:07.290 --> 15:09.510
because you know it's where our village is.

15:09.850 --> 15:12.220
Regan told me.

15:14.110 --> 15:16.520
So Miral Lake has such records, then.

15:17.510 --> 15:20.990
<i>With Regan's cooperation, I was able to determine</i>

15:20.990 --> 15:24.010
<i>that the Kunie Clan's village is 
near the Tearstone Mountains.</i>

15:24.780 --> 15:27.510
<i>"I know where you live."</i>

15:27.970 --> 15:29.730
<i>That's no more than a threat, right?</i>

15:29.730 --> 15:30.570
<i>But...</i>

15:30.980 --> 15:36.040
I'd love to accept a request from you, but...

15:36.320 --> 15:37.530
I cannot.

15:38.170 --> 15:39.540
Why?

15:40.070 --> 15:42.790
It goes against an ancient treaty.

15:45.880 --> 15:48.510
<i>Then it's just like what I found on my own.</i>

15:49.400 --> 15:54.750
<i>Banks in this world will neither 
loan nor invest money outside.</i>

15:55.180 --> 15:57.180
<i>They'll repay the money they've been given.</i>

15:57.710 --> 15:58.700
<i>That's all.</i>

15:59.850 --> 16:03.940
<i>It looks like the moneylender job class 
doesn't exist in this world.</i>

16:06.520 --> 16:08.870
<i>And all the money</i>

16:12.790 --> 16:14.780
<i>is gained by defeating monsters.</i>

16:16.110 --> 16:20.910
<i>The whole world has one common currency.</i>

16:23.980 --> 16:28.340
You can get money by defeating monsters, correct?

16:28.340 --> 16:30.170
Yes, that's right.

16:30.580 --> 16:32.560
And from treasure chests in dungeons.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.930
Sometimes, you'll get several 
hundred gold pieces at once.

16:35.340 --> 16:38.430
It's thanks to the bravery of the adventurers.

16:38.900 --> 16:42.940
If we can't get funding from the Kunie Clan,

16:43.770 --> 16:46.690
then why don't we get the money from the one

16:47.150 --> 16:50.860
who puts it there, before he does so?

16:54.980 --> 16:57.580
Shiro, you can't mean...

16:58.340 --> 17:01.340
<i>When you defeat monsters, you earn money.</i>

17:01.340 --> 17:04.150
<i>That's how a game works.</i>

17:04.700 --> 17:06.330
<i>But that isn't realistic at all.</i>

17:07.110 --> 17:10.800
<i>When</i> Elder Tale <i>was a game,</i>

17:10.800 --> 17:13.480
<i>there was a story about</i>

17:13.480 --> 17:17.000
<i>an ancient, powerful magic device that 
would give reborn souls gold coins.</i>

17:18.100 --> 17:20.390
<i>He's going to use that?</i>

17:20.390 --> 17:23.350
<i>Wait, is there even such a thing?</i>

17:24.070 --> 17:26.100
And you believe that is possible?

17:26.100 --> 17:32.700
Monster reincarnation can be 
explained via spirit theory.

17:32.700 --> 17:36.870
But who gives them the money?

17:37.390 --> 17:41.670
I read every single ancient record in Miral Lake.

17:41.670 --> 17:45.200
And... I found it.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.130
The Kunie Clan's gold.

17:49.790 --> 17:53.820
In the lowest part of the Depths of Palm,

17:53.820 --> 17:57.940
there is said to be a great whirlpool of gold.

17:58.490 --> 18:04.120
And the Sage of Miral Lake fifteen generations 
ago performed a sealing there.

18:05.530 --> 18:07.000
I confirmed it.

18:07.860 --> 18:14.280
It's sealed with Miral Lake's technology, 
but breaking it won't be that hard.

18:15.320 --> 18:17.520
That's what you were up to?

18:17.520 --> 18:22.740
Then you will get your money 
from this golden whirlpool?

18:23.310 --> 18:24.150
Yes.

18:24.880 --> 18:28.000
And you think this gold has something 
to do with the Kunie Clan?

18:29.020 --> 18:30.000
Yes.

18:30.250 --> 18:36.010
So wouldn't getting your gold there 
mean you'd be stealing it?

18:36.740 --> 18:39.910
Does the Round Table wish to plunder it?

18:40.440 --> 18:42.010
That's why I called you here.

18:42.980 --> 18:46.020
We don't want to fight the Kunie Clan.

18:46.770 --> 18:49.770
What would you use all that money for?

18:57.930 --> 18:59.490
If I explain,

19:01.240 --> 19:04.130
is there a chance you'll help us?

19:08.660 --> 19:09.950
None.

19:09.950 --> 19:12.290
It goes against an ancient treaty.

19:20.800 --> 19:24.060
Why did Shiroe talk to Kinjou?

19:24.860 --> 19:28.310
He could've just taken the gold.

19:29.260 --> 19:32.280
For his goals, Shiroe will do whatever it takes.

19:32.280 --> 19:33.060
But...

19:33.550 --> 19:35.900
It's different when he wants to make friends.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.070
Friends?

19:38.360 --> 19:40.380
He wanted to talk to them.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.300
He didn't want to lie.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.980
But the way he talks isn't very good.

19:44.980 --> 19:46.080
What do you mean?

19:46.500 --> 19:49.460
The guy from the Kunie Clan 
is a big believer in secrets.

19:49.890 --> 19:51.080
And Shiro...

19:52.220 --> 19:57.260
When he's making a new contract or 
doing business with a new person,

19:57.260 --> 19:59.070
he wants everyone to reveal all their secrets,

19:59.070 --> 20:02.840
so he knows where they're coming from and 
he can tell them everything about himself.

20:03.420 --> 20:05.480
He wants to make sure their interests align,

20:05.480 --> 20:07.930
and then show them he's a good 
partner who can be trusted!

20:09.110 --> 20:12.040
Were you a merchant, Naotsugu?

20:12.040 --> 20:14.050
I was in sales, actually.

20:14.050 --> 20:15.200
Sales?

20:15.580 --> 20:18.510
Is that a negotiation skill or something?

20:18.860 --> 20:22.210
Jeez, I wish he'd open up more.

20:33.090 --> 20:35.560
What do you think he meant by that?

20:37.650 --> 20:40.300
Then let us meet there.

20:40.730 --> 20:44.260
The meandering river and the 
forgotten underground garden,

20:44.260 --> 20:47.360
where gold that appears from the 
void disappears into the void.

20:48.740 --> 20:52.380
But you will need the company 
of many in order to get there.

20:52.770 --> 20:55.690
How will you reach the spring 
in the deepest depths?

20:56.250 --> 21:02.220
The Kunie Clan's answer will depend 
upon the result of your challenge.

21:03.650 --> 21:05.010
The company of many...

21:05.920 --> 21:10.830
He clearly means there'll be 
a large-scale battle, a raid.

21:13.300 --> 21:16.440
In the Depths of Palm, there's a raid zone.

21:17.100 --> 21:20.130
And unless we clear it, we can't have the gold.

21:20.650 --> 21:22.200
I'd expected it, but...

21:22.870 --> 21:25.160
That means we'll need people.

21:25.160 --> 21:25.960
Yeah.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.820
But I can't bring the Round Table members.

21:29.370 --> 21:31.430
The South is watching them.

21:32.180 --> 21:34.060
I don't want them to know what we're up to.

21:34.470 --> 21:36.110
Then what do we do?

21:37.600 --> 21:39.010
I know a place we could go.

21:47.910 --> 21:49.000
My lord...

21:57.060 --> 21:58.380
<i>I failed.</i>

22:00.910 --> 22:02.540
<i>I was naïve.</i>

22:04.740 --> 22:06.410
<i>I couldn't trust them enough.</i>

22:15.470 --> 22:17.060
You were defeated, Akatsuki?

22:20.060 --> 22:20.980
I see.

22:21.990 --> 22:23.490
So was I.

22:24.800 --> 22:25.850
I died.

22:28.800 --> 22:33.700
It's been a heck of a Christmas Eve, my lord.

24:05.850 --> 24:07.500
We land to the far north.

24:07.500 --> 24:11.430
There, we find a man whose name 
is William Massachusetts.

24:11.700 --> 24:14.470
The guild master of a proud fighting guild.

24:14.470 --> 24:17.270
A man who once broke off relations with Shiroe.

24:17.270 --> 24:20.020
And another... Demikas,

24:20.020 --> 24:22.390
a man whose life Shiroe once took.

24:22.980 --> 24:25.680
Next time: The Outlaw and Mithril Eyes.

24:22.980 --> 24:29.940
<b>The Outlaw and Mithril Eyes</b>

24:25.680 --> 24:27.800
Rise up once more.
