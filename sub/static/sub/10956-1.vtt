00:57.941 --> 01:02.537
I'm Erica Bain. And as you know,
I walk the city.

01:03.379 --> 01:08.139
I bitch and moan about it.
I walk and watch and listen...

01:08.218 --> 01:11.244
...a witness to all
the beauty and ugliness...

01:11.254 --> 01:14.481
...that is disappearing
from our beloved city.

01:14.491 --> 01:17.283
Last week took me to
the gray depths of the East River...

01:17.293 --> 01:20.620
...where Dimitri Panchenko
swims his morning laps...

01:20.630 --> 01:24.370
...Iike he has every morning
since the 1960s.

01:25.401 --> 01:30.964
Today I walked by the acres of scaffolding
outside what used to be the Plaza Hotel...

01:30.974 --> 01:33.636
...and I thought about Eloise.

01:33.843 --> 01:36.641
Remember Kay Thompson's Eloise?

01:36.813 --> 01:39.873
Eloise who lived in the Plaza Hotel...

01:39.883 --> 01:44.177
...with her dog Weenie and her parents,
who were always away...

01:44.187 --> 01:48.848
...and her English nanny who had
eight hairpins made out of bones.

01:48.858 --> 01:54.468
That Eloise. The adored brat
of my childhood. A little punk kid....

01:54.531 --> 01:59.559
Sid Vicious, spewing beer from his teeth
in the Chelsea Hotel.

01:59.569 --> 02:02.162
Andy Warhol, his sunglasses....

02:02.172 --> 02:07.200
Edgar Allan Poe, freeing live monkeys
from the crates of a crumbling schooner...

02:07.210 --> 02:10.508
...on the oily slips of South Street.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.807
Stories of a city...

02:12.982 --> 02:17.677
...that is disappearing before our eyes.
Its people swept over....

02:17.687 --> 02:20.313
So, what will be left of those stories?

02:20.323 --> 02:25.718
Are we going to have to construct an
imaginary city to house our memories?

02:25.728 --> 02:30.190
Because when you love something,
every time a bit of it goes...

02:30.200 --> 02:33.260
...you lose a piece of yourself.

02:33.770 --> 02:37.997
So where's Eloise going to sleep tonight?
Can you hear her ghost...

02:38.007 --> 02:42.335
...wandering around the collapsing
corridors of her beloved Plaza...

02:42.345 --> 02:44.737
...trying to find her nanny's room...

02:44.747 --> 02:47.841
...calling out
to the construction workers...

02:47.851 --> 02:50.581
...in a voice that nobody hears:

02:50.753 --> 02:54.746
" Has anyone seen my turtle,
Skipperdee? "

02:54.958 --> 02:59.853
This is Erica Bain, and you've been listening
to Street Walk on WNKW.

02:59.863 --> 03:02.923
-And this is 90.1, WNKW.
-All right.

03:03.933 --> 03:07.588
-See you next week.
-Have a good one, Erica.

03:10.373 --> 03:12.131
Hey, I'm out of here.

03:12.141 --> 03:14.601
Did Eloise really mean that much to you?

03:14.611 --> 03:17.670
Oh, come on, Carol.
Weren't you ever a little girl?

03:17.680 --> 03:20.974
Not the kind of little girl that
remembers the name of her turtle.

03:20.984 --> 03:22.980
Anyway, good show.

03:22.990 --> 03:26.279
Look, Bravo called again
about that TV spot.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.248
You know what? I'm--

03:28.258 --> 03:30.750
I'm not a face. I'm just a voice.

03:30.760 --> 03:33.920
The shows are on the website.
People can download them for free.

03:33.930 --> 03:36.160
-Yeah, exactly.
-Maybe.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.467
Bye.

03:40.136 --> 03:42.297
-Hello?
-Hey.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.731
-Hello.
-What are you wearing?

03:44.741 --> 03:48.768
Green scrubs, tied at the waist,
very sexy V-neck.

03:48.778 --> 03:51.704
-Short-sleeved little number.
-How about the sexy green hat?

03:51.714 --> 03:53.206
-Still got that?
-In my hand.

03:53.216 --> 03:56.476
You like it more than the others,
less than the others or the same?

03:56.486 --> 03:57.977
Oh, yeah. I'm at the place...

03:57.987 --> 04:01.648
...and I wanna make sure you're still okay
with the cream and the orange.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.049
Yeah, cream and orange.

04:03.059 --> 04:05.818
Actually, it's not cream.
It's vanilla. But that's fine.

04:05.828 --> 04:07.553
It's not cream. It's vanilla.

04:07.563 --> 04:11.157
-Who cares? Let's go get married tonight.
-Your mother cares.

04:11.167 --> 04:13.559
Trust me, she wants invitations.

04:13.569 --> 04:15.695
Yeah, these are good. Thanks.

04:15.705 --> 04:19.232
Hey, listen. For tonight, if you meet me
at Nicole's art thing...

04:19.242 --> 04:21.367
...you don't have to
talk to anyone but me.

04:21.377 --> 04:23.136
-Maybe.
-Come on.

04:23.146 --> 04:26.439
-I've got a game, haven't l?
-You're not coming?

04:26.449 --> 04:28.641
-Look, I've gotta go.
-What?

04:28.651 --> 04:30.310
I do love you.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.720
Yeah. I love you too.

04:33.957 --> 04:36.167
-Hi.
-Hi. Oh, you're James.

04:36.459 --> 04:38.351
-I'm Erica. I'm Nicole's friend.
-Hi.

04:38.361 --> 04:41.254
These are good.
They're really cool. I love them.

04:41.264 --> 04:45.224
The Laundromat is in a town in Jersey
where Diane Arbus used to do her laundry.

04:45.234 --> 04:49.162
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, that gun store is down in Chinatown.

04:49.172 --> 04:51.931
Berenice Abbott shot it in the '30s.

04:51.941 --> 04:55.001
It's really evocative, you know?

04:55.178 --> 04:58.771
Kind of quiet. I like that.
It doesn't make too much noise.

04:58.781 --> 04:59.973
Thanks.

04:59.983 --> 05:02.375
Bring more drinks, less shrimp. More.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.110
Where you going? You're leaving?

05:04.120 --> 05:07.647
-No, no. I'm staying. I'm staying.
-Oh, my God, you're such a bad liar.

05:07.657 --> 05:08.915
I know, but I try.

05:08.925 --> 05:11.651
You have to convince him
to come to one of these things.

05:11.661 --> 05:14.187
He can't avoid us forever. Oh, my God.

05:14.197 --> 05:16.789
-What are you doing here?
-Don't you love this woman?

05:16.799 --> 05:19.926
I could take her or leave her.
You guys...

05:19.936 --> 05:22.161
...this, when it starts, it's disgusting.

05:22.171 --> 05:23.863
-We have to go.
-You're too happy.

05:23.873 --> 05:25.064
-Say goodbye.
-Bye.

05:25.074 --> 05:26.332
-I hate you.
-I love you.

05:26.342 --> 05:28.892
I really-- I hate you so much.

05:33.549 --> 05:36.177
Oh, God. It's so pretty out.

05:36.786 --> 05:39.212
Tell you what. I'll get him.
You sit here. Okay?

05:39.222 --> 05:41.281
No, let me get him.

05:41.457 --> 05:44.117
-Okay. Will you get me my jacket too?
-Fine.

05:44.127 --> 05:46.561
Here. Take this.

05:46.729 --> 05:48.729
Thanks.

05:55.738 --> 05:57.230
Hey.

05:57.240 --> 05:59.970
Oh, I can open my own door.

06:01.044 --> 06:03.044
Thank you.

06:13.823 --> 06:16.155
Good boy. Good boy.

06:17.527 --> 06:19.893
-Hi, puppy!
-Here.

06:21.898 --> 06:24.824
Are you gonna be that crabby
when you get older?

06:24.834 --> 06:27.564
I am older. And I'm way meaner.

06:27.737 --> 06:31.052
Look, she gave me an apple. Here, baby.

06:33.876 --> 06:37.446
-So she is human.
-That was too big a bite.

06:37.747 --> 06:42.442
That was too big a bite.
I didn't say you could eat the whole thing.

06:42.452 --> 06:43.976
You know what?

06:43.986 --> 06:49.682
I could get about maybe five days and we
could go to the place with the water and...

06:49.692 --> 06:53.287
...find good food and lots of sleeping.

06:53.463 --> 06:55.463
Yes, I concur.

06:56.699 --> 06:58.699
Here, boy. Good boy.

07:00.803 --> 07:02.803
Good boy.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.310
Don't give it to him. Throw it.

07:13.716 --> 07:17.477
-I wasn't mucking about, you know.
-What about?

07:17.487 --> 07:20.446
Why can't we go down
to city hall tonight?

07:20.456 --> 07:23.601
-Because it's closed.
-Tomorrow, then.

07:24.894 --> 07:27.186
David, you have a family.
I don't, you know?

07:27.196 --> 07:31.616
-You're not marrying my family.
-Well, I am, kind of.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.496
I mean, I hope I am.

07:37.073 --> 07:41.400
Your mom is so sweet and she just--
She wants the whole deal, you know?

07:41.410 --> 07:44.072
She wants the invitations...

07:44.247 --> 07:48.843
...and the band playing and the minister.

07:49.886 --> 07:53.346
I don't know. Maybe I do too,
you know? Because...

07:53.356 --> 07:56.841
...it's not like I'm gonna do this twice.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.560
You're not?

08:00.596 --> 08:02.791
No, I'm not.

08:04.600 --> 08:08.255
That's the nicest thing
you ever said to me.

08:25.454 --> 08:27.346
Where's Curtis?

08:27.356 --> 08:29.248
Oi, Curtis!

08:29.258 --> 08:31.258
Come on, boy.

08:31.594 --> 08:34.399
Come on, pup! Did he go up there?

08:35.398 --> 08:37.890
-He's not in there, is he?
-Come on!

08:37.900 --> 08:39.900
Curtis?

08:41.837 --> 08:43.837
Hey!

08:43.972 --> 08:45.973
-There he is.
-Curtis.

08:50.947 --> 08:53.582
-Come on, boy.
-Curtis, come on.

08:55.885 --> 08:57.710
Hey, Curtis?

08:57.720 --> 09:00.484
-Hey.
-Curtis.

09:04.227 --> 09:06.227
Hey.

09:07.396 --> 09:10.723
-What's up, boy?
-What's wrong, sweetheart?

09:10.733 --> 09:12.191
Hey.

09:12.201 --> 09:14.794
Man, don't you know
there's a fucking leash law?

09:14.804 --> 09:17.864
Yeah, don't you fucking know better?

09:17.940 --> 09:20.833
Yeah. I'm sorry. Thanks for finding him.

09:20.843 --> 09:24.328
It's-- It's all good, bro. It's all good.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.472
But...

09:26.482 --> 09:29.117
...I get a reward or something?

09:33.389 --> 09:35.481
Our gratitude. Now give him to me.

09:35.491 --> 09:38.618
Come on, man. You know gratitude
ain't worth shit around here.

09:38.628 --> 09:41.020
-You're hurting him!
-Give me the dog.

09:41.030 --> 09:45.091
No, I don't think so.
See, I kind of like this dog.

09:45.101 --> 09:47.821
I think he's a keeper. A keeper.

09:48.170 --> 09:50.170
Smile, baby.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.639
-You are a cunt.
-Fuck you, bitch!

09:59.649 --> 10:04.710
Come on, motherfucker.
That's what I thought, you stupid pussy.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.679
-Look....
-Go.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.348
I haven't got much money.
You can have what I've got.

10:09.358 --> 10:12.718
Give me your watch, give me your
ring. Let's go, I ain't got all day.

10:12.728 --> 10:14.887
Hurry the fuck up, princess.

10:14.897 --> 10:17.223
-Let's go. Hurry up!
-Give him the shit.

10:17.233 --> 10:19.783
-Get the fuck over here.
-Fuck!

10:20.836 --> 10:23.737
-David!
-I fucking missed it!

10:23.939 --> 10:25.331
Where you going?

10:25.341 --> 10:28.656
-Action!
-Think you're fucking with me?!

10:28.711 --> 10:30.711
You just made my day!

10:32.381 --> 10:35.186
Popped your motherfucking cherry!

10:35.484 --> 10:37.484
Let's even shit out.

10:38.020 --> 10:40.212
Ready for your close-up, cunt?!

10:40.222 --> 10:41.814
Heads up!

10:41.824 --> 10:43.015
Hollywood!

10:43.025 --> 10:45.575
Think you're fucking with me?!

10:48.164 --> 10:51.479
You ain't got nothing to say now, fool!

10:51.534 --> 10:55.527
-David.
-Oh, how cute. Lovebirds.

10:55.705 --> 10:59.870
-A chickenhead and a faggot.
-Say "cheese," bitch!

12:05.007 --> 12:06.699
This is the emergency room.

12:06.709 --> 12:09.668
-Did you get any sleep?
-No. Where's Murrow?

12:09.678 --> 12:11.604
We're looking for him.

12:11.614 --> 12:15.207
She was dead on arrival
and her fingerprints are all over the gun.

12:15.217 --> 12:17.217
-Where?
-Bedroom.

12:17.319 --> 12:19.315
Daughter called 911.

12:19.325 --> 12:22.154
Thanks. I wanna see her.

12:30.199 --> 12:33.657
-So he's laughing again.
-Yeah.

12:38.707 --> 12:44.657
Listen, the kid's in a waiting room
with ACS. I'll meet you over there.

12:49.151 --> 12:52.041
We need your signature right here.

12:54.523 --> 12:56.523
Where is she?

13:02.631 --> 13:06.089
-Can I talk to her?
-You can try.

13:08.337 --> 13:10.337
Hey, sweetie.

13:10.372 --> 13:12.667
Can I have a word with you?

13:14.777 --> 13:18.543
We're just gonna be right here.
All right.

13:19.748 --> 13:21.807
You like lollipops?

13:32.061 --> 13:34.061
Pick one.

13:36.365 --> 13:39.255
That was the one I was gonna pick.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.572
You know, sweetie...

13:46.742 --> 13:52.938
...something you should know. Your
mommy, she was really worried about you.

13:52.948 --> 13:58.113
And if she could, she would tell you
that you can trust me.

14:04.527 --> 14:07.386
Did your stepfather hurt your mommy?

14:07.396 --> 14:09.054
Sean? Sean!

14:09.064 --> 14:10.723
Okay. Okay, step back!

14:10.733 --> 14:12.825
-I want my daughter!
-Get back!

14:12.835 --> 14:15.429
All right! All right.

14:20.910 --> 14:22.601
You don't have the right.

14:22.611 --> 14:25.271
-I do--
-At a time like this, I need to see her.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.506
No, you don't. I do have the right.

14:27.516 --> 14:30.276
-She is my daughter.
-No, she is your stepdaughter.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.444
And you know
how this whole thing works.

14:32.454 --> 14:35.814
You done been through this a thousand
times. You hire your lawyers...

14:35.824 --> 14:40.924
...and you do your thing.
But right now, we're gonna do ours.

14:41.764 --> 14:46.694
-I'm gonna take a walk. You deal with him.
-Yeah, I got it.

14:47.937 --> 14:51.464
That was Dr. Sterling. Okay, bye-bye.

15:11.994 --> 15:14.019
It's a hell of a thing.

15:14.597 --> 15:17.862
-Yup.
-I heard her show once.

16:00.576 --> 16:02.576
Erica?

16:04.380 --> 16:06.871
Erica, can you hear me?

16:08.050 --> 16:10.050
Erica?

16:10.386 --> 16:12.547
You had the service?

16:13.122 --> 16:15.914
They didn't know when
you were going to wake up...

16:15.924 --> 16:18.644
...if you were going to wake up.

16:19.094 --> 16:21.722
You were gone for three weeks.

16:21.897 --> 16:25.389
We had to let him go. We had to.

16:25.634 --> 16:27.526
I wanna see him again.

16:27.536 --> 16:29.361
-He's gone.
-I wanna see him again!

16:29.371 --> 16:31.703
He's gone, honey.

16:35.744 --> 16:39.059
He would have been happy
that you lived.

16:51.827 --> 16:56.332
Nurse Bench, you have a call on one-four.
Nurse Bench.

16:58.567 --> 17:03.729
I don't know. All the faces
are starting to blur together. I--

17:03.739 --> 17:05.664
I just can't tell anymore, you know?

17:05.674 --> 17:10.135
You gotta help us here. We need
something from you, anything.

17:10.145 --> 17:12.238
Let's start over again.

17:12.414 --> 17:17.598
He hit your boyfriend with the pipe.
Once, twice, three times?

17:18.753 --> 17:20.311
We know how tough it can be...

17:20.321 --> 17:23.297
-...to go back there--
-Do you, huh?

17:24.992 --> 17:28.520
Look, Miss Bain, we're on your side.

17:30.933 --> 17:32.791
Yeah.

17:32.801 --> 17:34.801
I know that.

17:35.537 --> 17:37.537
You're the good guys.

17:38.941 --> 17:42.171
So how come it doesn't feel like that?

22:03.905 --> 22:08.533
Please leave a message for David and Erica
after the beep.

22:08.543 --> 22:11.808
Hey, it's me. Call me at the gallery.

22:11.980 --> 22:15.465
I'll take you out. Go to dinner, a movie.

22:15.951 --> 22:19.011
Let's go for a walk. Anything, okay?

24:16.004 --> 24:18.438
Ma'am, can I help you?

24:19.741 --> 24:22.200
Detective O'Connor and Detective Pitney,
please.

24:22.210 --> 24:26.638
Pitney and O'Connor are out.
Can anyone else help you?

24:26.648 --> 24:28.573
Well...

24:28.583 --> 24:31.076
...you know,
I wanted to check on my case.

24:31.086 --> 24:33.879
I've been calling and
we've been playing phone tag...

24:33.889 --> 24:36.314
-...and I thought that if I came down--
-Okay.

24:36.324 --> 24:38.959
What kind of case did you have?

24:41.296 --> 24:43.555
My boyfriend was beaten to death.

24:43.565 --> 24:47.985
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you have a complaint report number?

24:48.270 --> 24:51.897
-No, I don't know it.
-And what was his name?

24:51.907 --> 24:53.966
David Kirmani.

24:54.809 --> 24:57.607
K-l-R-M-A-N-l.

24:58.947 --> 25:01.412
It might be under Erica Bain.

25:04.786 --> 25:07.112
About how long ago did it happen?

25:07.122 --> 25:09.122
June 1 1th.

25:11.059 --> 25:13.285
Okay. I realize how difficult
this can be...

25:13.295 --> 25:16.354
...but if you'd please be patient
and have a seat over there...

25:16.364 --> 25:18.957
...an officer will be down shortly
to help you.

25:18.967 --> 25:20.967
Okay.

25:43.158 --> 25:45.016
I realize how difficult it can be...

25:45.026 --> 25:48.086
...but if you'd please be patient
and have a seat over there...

25:48.096 --> 25:52.006
...an officer will be down shortly
to help you.

26:17.959 --> 26:20.218
-Wanna get something to eat?
-What's up, guys?

26:20.228 --> 26:22.087
-Hey.
-You saw the game last night?

26:22.097 --> 26:24.097
Man.

26:35.577 --> 26:37.577
Could I help you?

26:40.548 --> 26:42.641
Yeah. I wanna buy a gun.

26:42.817 --> 26:44.542
License?

26:44.552 --> 26:47.779
Oh, yeah, of course.
I need a license, yeah.

26:47.789 --> 26:52.384
Once you get one, fill out this form,
and we'll notify you in 30 days.

26:52.394 --> 26:54.219
I need to get something now.

26:54.229 --> 26:56.229
Sorry. That's illegal.

26:58.199 --> 27:00.199
Hey!

27:00.602 --> 27:02.900
I won't survive 30 days.

27:12.647 --> 27:14.339
Hey.

27:14.349 --> 27:17.409
-What happened to you?
-Me? Nothing.

27:17.585 --> 27:19.585
A thousand dollars.

27:20.422 --> 27:22.314
A thousand dollars?

27:22.324 --> 27:24.749
Okay, but I need to learn how to use it.

27:24.759 --> 27:27.751
No shit. Follow me.

27:51.453 --> 27:53.453
Wait right here.

27:56.991 --> 27:58.991
In here.

28:01.229 --> 28:04.789
It's a Kahr K9.
Check to see if it's loaded.

28:04.799 --> 28:06.191
How do I do that?

28:06.201 --> 28:09.170
The chamber. Pull the slide back.

28:09.337 --> 28:14.699
It's got internal safety so you don't
shoot yourself. Loads from the handle.

28:14.709 --> 28:16.709
All right.

28:19.647 --> 28:21.942
You pay me now, it's yours.

28:25.987 --> 28:28.197
I'll throw in the bullets.

28:33.595 --> 28:35.595
Yeah, I'll take it.

29:01.122 --> 29:03.122
Got it, got it, got it.

29:28.516 --> 29:32.543
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.188
I don't care.

29:35.990 --> 29:38.618
There's plenty of ways to die.

29:40.695 --> 29:43.955
But you have to figure out a way to live.

29:43.965 --> 29:47.696
Now, that's hard.

30:05.920 --> 30:08.718
Look at you, all sophisticated.

30:10.558 --> 30:15.573
-You shouldn't be working this late.
-I had a client dinner.

30:15.663 --> 30:17.989
Hey, can I get a dirty martini
for the lady?

30:17.999 --> 30:20.804
You said this was business, Sean.

30:21.069 --> 30:23.069
It is.

30:24.506 --> 30:26.506
Eighty-six that.

30:28.476 --> 30:31.281
Okay, l--
I need a favor from you.

30:32.714 --> 30:34.714
You....

30:35.383 --> 30:39.511
-You heard about that Murrow thing, right?
-His wife killed herself.

30:39.521 --> 30:42.914
Oh, come on. Women don't
shoot themselves in the face.

30:42.924 --> 30:45.256
At least in my experience.

30:45.426 --> 30:50.193
Where do they shoot themselves,
in your experience?

30:53.001 --> 30:55.001
The heart.

31:01.509 --> 31:03.534
Jackie, I been...

31:03.945 --> 31:07.906
...chasing after this asshole
for three straight years.

31:07.916 --> 31:11.676
And right when his wife was ready
to turn state's evidence on him...

31:11.686 --> 31:16.714
...instead of blowing the lid off of him,
she blows off her own head.

31:16.724 --> 31:19.699
-Come on.
-You don't let go, do you?

31:24.432 --> 31:26.432
So what can I do?

31:29.671 --> 31:33.107
Well, she has a daughter.
Had a daughter.

31:33.274 --> 31:35.274
And...

31:35.843 --> 31:38.303
...her daughter knows something.

31:38.313 --> 31:41.706
But now he's asked for custody of her
and then he's gonna get it.

31:41.716 --> 31:44.342
-ls he the father?
-No, no. He's her stepfather.

31:44.352 --> 31:46.711
-And you want her made a ward of court.
-Yes.

31:46.721 --> 31:49.113
She knows something
and she's not safe with him.

31:49.123 --> 31:53.284
Look, all I'm asking you to do
is just act on her behalf.

31:53.294 --> 31:55.294
Please.

31:58.232 --> 32:00.232
Sean, I'm your ex-wife.

32:00.635 --> 32:02.635
Conflict of interest.

32:03.471 --> 32:06.276
And besides, I don't do pro bono.

32:10.378 --> 32:12.378
You used to.

32:12.780 --> 32:15.146
Yeah, well, I grew up.

32:48.850 --> 32:50.041
When did you get out?!

32:50.051 --> 32:52.744
-You won't let me see my kids?
-You can't be here! Court order!

32:52.754 --> 32:57.684
-I'm calling 911!
-If I can't see them, you won't see them!

33:00.928 --> 33:02.928
Try seeing them now.

33:07.068 --> 33:09.068
It's my money too.

33:59.620 --> 34:02.020
I can hear you breathing.

34:28.549 --> 34:30.549
No.

35:51.666 --> 35:54.125
-Squad central.
-Notify upon arrival.

35:54.135 --> 35:56.894
-Damn.
-We're a 10-84 at 110 and Lenox.

35:56.904 --> 35:59.931
10-4. Eighty-five to patrol supervisor
on the scene.

35:59.941 --> 36:03.766
-10-4.
-Looks like the circus made it to town.

36:34.242 --> 36:35.499
Any IDs?

36:35.509 --> 36:39.844
Victim's a 30-year-old Vietnamese female.
Ida Combs.

36:40.915 --> 36:43.805
-Where's the other body?
-This way.

36:44.352 --> 36:48.186
Got a 39-year-old, Sandy Combs.
White male.

36:48.356 --> 36:52.650
Looks like he was a roadie for Aerosmith.
I don't think those guys have a dental plan.

36:52.660 --> 36:54.952
Guy had a rap sheet longer than my dick.

36:54.962 --> 36:57.624
So in other words, no priors.

36:58.232 --> 37:00.232
Easy.

37:01.802 --> 37:06.998
So we got us a Sandy Combs and
an Ida Combs. What does that tell us?

37:07.008 --> 37:10.268
They're married.
I'm way ahead of you, pal.

37:10.278 --> 37:14.372
-Yeah, that's one way of ending it.
-You know, what's wrong with divorce?

37:14.382 --> 37:16.382
Everything.

37:16.751 --> 37:18.878
Divorce sucks.

37:20.554 --> 37:22.013
Okay, so tell me.

37:22.023 --> 37:24.749
Well, she took three in the torso
with a.38.

37:24.759 --> 37:29.720
Then somebody smoked him with a 9 mm
automatic. Don't ask me who, though.

37:29.730 --> 37:32.062
And we found these casings.

37:34.101 --> 37:38.296
Three casings. Looks like there's
a partial print on one, but it's smudged.

37:38.306 --> 37:39.830
Anybody check surveillance?

37:39.840 --> 37:43.835
That monitor's working,
but the machine's empty.

37:53.521 --> 37:55.521
Machine's working.

37:55.957 --> 37:58.847
-But where's the tape?
-Don't know.

38:03.597 --> 38:05.790
And why didn't he take the money?

38:05.800 --> 38:08.435
They chickened out, got scared?

38:10.871 --> 38:15.171
We got three casings, only one hit.
How about that?

38:15.343 --> 38:18.803
Maybe he's farsighted, crappy shooter.
Who knows?

38:18.813 --> 38:21.448
Or he never fired a gun before.

38:57.485 --> 38:59.410
It is...

38:59.420 --> 39:01.718
...astonishing...

39:03.491 --> 39:05.959
...numbing, to find...

39:06.861 --> 39:10.176
...that inside you there is a stranger.

39:10.798 --> 39:12.857
One that has your...

39:13.034 --> 39:15.034
...arms...

39:15.703 --> 39:17.703
...your legs...

39:17.872 --> 39:19.872
...your eyes.

39:21.609 --> 39:25.773
A sleepless, restless stranger...

39:27.481 --> 39:29.506
...who keeps walking...

39:30.518 --> 39:32.645
...keeps eating...

39:33.354 --> 39:35.179
...keeps...

39:35.189 --> 39:37.189
...Iiving.

39:43.297 --> 39:46.755
New York, like any metropolis--

39:48.169 --> 39:53.230
New York, like any metropolis,
is an organism that changes, mutates.

39:53.240 --> 39:58.170
Building sprout-like chromosomes
on the DNA of its streets.

40:11.959 --> 40:14.894
New York, like any metropolis...

40:15.062 --> 40:18.022
...is an organism that changes, mutates.

40:18.032 --> 40:22.962
Building sprout-like chromosomes
on the DNA of its streets.

40:39.553 --> 40:43.681
Look, I've got-- I've got two shows
that are almost finished.

40:43.691 --> 40:48.018
They're already mixed. All they need is an
intro and an outro, which I could do live.

40:48.028 --> 40:49.987
I've got six shows in various stages.

40:49.997 --> 40:55.559
I've got all these stories in my files.
You know, new stuff, better stuff.

40:55.569 --> 40:59.130
And I know what I'm doing,
and you know that I know what I'm doing.

40:59.140 --> 41:02.115
Erica. You've been through so much.

41:02.276 --> 41:04.869
You need more time before
you put yourself out there.

41:04.879 --> 41:07.371
-Don't make me beg.
-I don't mean to.

41:07.381 --> 41:10.608
But we have a public and I'm not sure
you're ready for it yet.

41:10.618 --> 41:13.210
You telling me I can't work
because of what happened?

41:13.220 --> 41:15.552
I did not say that.

41:16.790 --> 41:18.790
Look...

41:20.094 --> 41:22.644
...I just need to keep living.

41:22.696 --> 41:25.062
You know, I don't wanna....

41:25.799 --> 41:28.165
I don't wanna disappear.

41:36.110 --> 41:41.605
--station WNKW,
located at 90.1 on the FM dial.

41:41.782 --> 41:43.943
Up next is Street Walk.

41:44.118 --> 41:47.478
Let's now join Erica Bain
in our WNKW studios.

41:47.488 --> 41:50.855
Okay, Erica.
Three, two, one, you're on.

41:51.025 --> 41:54.425
This is Erica Bain, and I walk the city.

41:55.196 --> 41:57.196
New York...

41:57.598 --> 42:01.432
...Iike any metropolis, is an organism....

42:17.952 --> 42:20.411
Okay. Is there anything we can cut to?

42:20.421 --> 42:22.313
Music, prerecord, anything?

42:22.323 --> 42:24.363
Give me a minute, Carol.

42:24.658 --> 42:26.658
New York...

42:27.528 --> 42:29.962
...Iike any metropolis...

42:31.732 --> 42:33.732
...is....

42:44.245 --> 42:46.475
Oh, shit.

42:49.883 --> 42:51.908
New York...

42:53.354 --> 42:56.414
...the safest big city in the world.

42:58.692 --> 43:01.354
But it is horrible...

43:01.729 --> 43:04.789
...to fear the place you once loved.

43:06.066 --> 43:09.891
And to see a street corner
you knew so well...

43:10.104 --> 43:12.739
...and be afraid of its shadow.

43:13.307 --> 43:17.217
To see familiar steps,
be unable to climb them.

43:18.012 --> 43:22.005
I never understood
how people lived with fear.

43:23.117 --> 43:26.007
Women afraid to walk home alone...

43:26.053 --> 43:28.283
...people afraid of...

43:28.555 --> 43:30.714
...white powder in their mailbox...

43:30.724 --> 43:34.251
...darkness and night.

43:34.928 --> 43:38.227
People afraid of people.

43:39.600 --> 43:44.020
I always believed that fear
belonged to other people.

43:44.271 --> 43:46.671
Weaker people.

43:48.976 --> 43:51.171
It never touched me.

43:56.050 --> 43:58.143
And then it did.

44:01.655 --> 44:04.448
And when it touches you, you know...

44:04.458 --> 44:07.484
...that it's been there all along...

44:07.494 --> 44:12.193
...waiting beneath the surfaces
of everything you loved.

44:12.633 --> 44:16.626
And your skin crawls...

44:17.871 --> 44:19.630
...and your heart sickens...

44:19.640 --> 44:25.590
...and you look at the person you once were
walking down that street...

44:28.115 --> 44:30.750
...and you wonder, will you...?

44:32.319 --> 44:34.879
Will you ever be her again?

45:15.129 --> 45:17.129
Talk to me.

45:47.528 --> 45:50.320
Look at this motherfucker right here.

45:50.330 --> 45:53.815
Hey, what sounds
you got up in there, dog?

45:54.334 --> 45:57.561
This motherfucker
think I'm playing, man.

45:57.571 --> 46:01.498
Don't nobody talk in New York no more?
I asked you a motherfucking question!

46:01.508 --> 46:04.201
I said, what are you listening to,
you fucking faggot?!

46:04.211 --> 46:05.969
-Radiohead, man.
-Radiohead?

46:05.979 --> 46:07.979
Leave him alone, man!

46:08.015 --> 46:09.873
Man, shut the fuck up!

46:09.883 --> 46:12.309
Little man, you ain't know
your pop sucked dick?

46:12.319 --> 46:15.913
He's good at it too. Now, you wanna
grow up to be like that punk ass?

46:15.923 --> 46:17.915
That's a nice watch.
How old are you?

46:17.925 --> 46:20.918
-Get your ass out of here.
-Tell your mom I said "What's up? "

46:20.928 --> 46:23.921
Yo, little man, holler at me,
I'll show you how to be a G.

46:23.931 --> 46:26.821
Hey, yo, thanks for the iPod, man.

46:27.201 --> 46:30.627
This shit is nice, man.
This is all me right here.

46:30.637 --> 46:33.197
-I'm keeping this joint.
-You kidding me, right?

46:33.207 --> 46:35.207
This is cool.

46:39.179 --> 46:40.604
Oh, shit.

46:40.614 --> 46:45.459
-Yo, yo, yo, I got this, I got this.
-Bitch, is you crazy?

46:49.656 --> 46:51.656
This is too easy, man.

46:58.165 --> 47:00.165
So...

47:02.402 --> 47:05.717
...you gonna give me some Radiohead
too?

47:12.646 --> 47:15.366
You ever been fucked by a knife?

48:01.895 --> 48:04.621
I should have walked out of that train.

48:04.631 --> 48:10.241
I could've just shown them the gun,
and they wouldn't have hurt me.

48:12.539 --> 48:15.235
Why don't my hands shake?

48:15.642 --> 48:18.611
Why doesn't somebody stop me?

48:26.353 --> 48:28.446
I swear they like Oreos.

48:28.622 --> 48:30.213
Homicide, this is Vitale.

48:30.223 --> 48:32.816
There you go,
you're doing the tricks again.

48:32.826 --> 48:36.553
Upside down. No, come on up.
Gotta come to the top. There you go, baby.

48:36.563 --> 48:38.563
Okay, thank you.

48:38.599 --> 48:41.358
We've got two confirmed shot
on a subway from Brooklyn.

48:41.368 --> 48:44.828
Church Street, lower Manhattan.
Everyone's arguing whose jurisdiction.

48:44.838 --> 48:49.003
-That makes it ours.
-All right, fellas, let's go.

49:30.851 --> 49:34.678
We got two dead bodies inside
the subway car, and no eyewitnesses.

49:34.688 --> 49:36.980
Of course not.
Did you check with BCI?

49:36.990 --> 49:38.382
Yeah, I got this printout.

49:38.392 --> 49:40.050
-They here yet?
-Yes, sir.

49:40.060 --> 49:43.715
-And I'll get them to you.
-Morning, fellas.

49:45.132 --> 49:47.396
Christ on a cracker.

49:48.001 --> 49:51.732
Well, I hope this is their stop.

49:54.241 --> 49:57.438
Got Radiohead, U2, Dixie Chicks.

49:57.611 --> 50:00.926
-No Wu-Tang?
-I don't think this is his.

50:06.186 --> 50:08.186
Money in his pocket.

50:18.265 --> 50:21.029
Looks like a 9 mm automatic.

50:22.736 --> 50:25.541
-Like from the other night?
-Yeah.

50:27.074 --> 50:31.324
Check it against Brass Catchers,
see if it matches.

50:43.256 --> 50:45.256
Hey, you.

50:47.294 --> 50:51.054
--just go inside. I came out here for
a smoke. I just wanna go back in.

50:51.064 --> 50:55.399
You're giving me a hard time.
You let my friends in.

51:07.314 --> 51:12.275
They both had cash, so neither one of them
was robbed. And they had priors.

51:12.285 --> 51:14.285
A shitload of them.

51:15.088 --> 51:17.814
The guy at Sandy's, he had priors.

51:17.824 --> 51:19.750
I know, but that was domestic.

51:19.760 --> 51:22.160
No, but he wasn't robbed.

51:23.430 --> 51:25.430
Or something.

51:25.465 --> 51:29.205
-I mean, what are we missing?
-I wish I knew.

51:29.836 --> 51:32.963
Now, look. You got a small guy sitting.

51:32.973 --> 51:35.866
These two punks come at him with a knife
and, you know...

51:35.876 --> 51:38.735
...he shoots the first one without
getting out of his seat.

51:38.745 --> 51:40.437
Right. Go on, I'm with you.

51:40.447 --> 51:44.608
It's like maybe Mr. Average Joe just
decided, "I'm not gonna take it anymore.

51:44.618 --> 51:46.977
And I'm gonna take matters
into my own hands."

51:46.987 --> 51:49.246
The kind of guy
you wouldn't even notice.

51:49.256 --> 51:52.349
Well, if that's true, he's getting better.

51:52.359 --> 51:55.123
Yeah. Every bullet hit home.

52:06.072 --> 52:07.564
-Detective!
-Hey, detective!

52:07.574 --> 52:11.203
-Detective!
-Any leads, detective? Please.

52:12.312 --> 52:15.839
-Come on, step back!
-What about the bodies, detective?

52:15.849 --> 52:18.542
It's a new-- It's a new investigation.

52:18.552 --> 52:21.278
We haven't talked to anybody yet, no.

52:21.288 --> 52:23.146
It's a brand-new investigation.

52:23.156 --> 52:28.001
-Any suspects?
-No, we're not-- I'm sorry, but we're not--

52:28.028 --> 52:30.028
Any leads? How many?

52:30.130 --> 52:32.130
Detective!

52:32.465 --> 52:34.224
Hey.

52:34.234 --> 52:36.193
Excuse me, don't I know you?

52:36.203 --> 52:38.995
-No, I don't think we've met.
-Wait a minute. I know you.

52:39.005 --> 52:41.064
-No. You haven't. I--
-What's your name?

52:41.074 --> 52:43.900
My name's Erica Bain.
I do a radio show.

52:43.910 --> 52:47.504
I don't know if you'd be interested in doing
an interview. I'd love to--

52:47.514 --> 52:49.873
I'm sorry.
We're not talking to the media now.

52:49.883 --> 52:52.576
I'm not that kind of media.
It would be about you.

52:52.586 --> 52:55.221
My life's not that interesting.

52:55.522 --> 52:59.347
-Yeah, but the work you do is.
-No, thank you.

53:12.105 --> 53:14.105
So...

53:14.608 --> 53:17.923
...you gonna give me some Radiohead
too?

53:23.116 --> 53:25.880
You ever been fucked by a knife?

53:38.698 --> 53:40.724
How the hell did this get out so quick?

53:40.734 --> 53:45.962
Who knows? Coroner hates you,
people fucking technicians. Who knows?

53:45.972 --> 53:47.972
"Bloodbath."

53:49.175 --> 53:51.473
You ever listen to NKW?

53:51.645 --> 53:54.365
-What is that, like hip-hop?
-No.

53:55.248 --> 53:57.540
Remember a couple of months ago...

53:57.550 --> 54:00.977
...this girl and her boyfriend,
they got jacked in Central Park?

54:00.987 --> 54:04.848
-No. Which ones?
-Well, anyway, she has this radio show.

54:04.858 --> 54:07.918
-Right.
-She shows up at the subway last night...

54:07.928 --> 54:11.488
-...and guess who she wants to interview?
-Me?

54:11.498 --> 54:15.558
What, you? You should totally do it.
Remember that Bernie Goetz thing?

54:15.568 --> 54:16.760
Hey, is Carter in?

54:16.770 --> 54:19.663
Reporters calling in the night.
Reporters eat that shit up.

54:19.673 --> 54:23.400
No, well, she's not that kind of reporter.
Yeah, well, have him call me.

54:23.410 --> 54:25.268
What is she?
Like a DJ or something?

54:25.278 --> 54:27.938
-No, she's just interesting, you know.
-Interesting?

54:27.948 --> 54:30.006
Have him call me at my desk.
It's Mercer.

54:30.016 --> 54:32.375
What's she want with you?
Give her my number.

54:32.385 --> 54:34.945
What's her precise street address?

54:34.955 --> 54:36.513
You know what I want?

54:36.523 --> 54:38.848
I want everyone in the market
that night...

54:38.858 --> 54:42.819
...everyone on the subway, outside.
Everybody, I need them all brought in.

54:42.829 --> 54:45.322
Somebody has to have seen this guy.

54:45.332 --> 54:48.358
I need you to get the registration
off of this iPod.

54:48.368 --> 54:51.258
-See who it belongs to.
-I'm on it.

54:55.542 --> 54:57.400
You've been avoiding me.

54:57.410 --> 54:59.069
-No, I haven't.
-Yeah.

54:59.079 --> 55:02.672
You've been avoiding
the full glare of my disapproval.

55:02.682 --> 55:07.344
Yeah, well, it was-- The show sucked
and everybody hated it. I'm sorry.

55:07.354 --> 55:10.880
Well, we don't normally do silence
on WNKW.

55:10.890 --> 55:13.183
You almost managed a full minute.

55:13.193 --> 55:15.552
Well, I think I did
an okay recovery, so....

55:15.562 --> 55:20.917
You got 11 more steps, do you?
Are they all gonna be on the air?

55:23.603 --> 55:28.336
I thought we were better than
some AM confessional...

55:28.508 --> 55:30.767
...but people are responding.

55:30.777 --> 55:35.367
I was wrong.
I'm big enough to admit it, so keep it up.

55:58.605 --> 56:00.605
Erica Bain?

56:02.042 --> 56:04.042
Erica Bain.

56:04.711 --> 56:07.043
I'm Detective Mercer. You--

56:09.315 --> 56:12.035
You remember me from last night?

56:13.486 --> 56:15.784
-Yeah.
-Yeah, well...

56:16.289 --> 56:20.191
...I saw you in the hospital after....

56:20.560 --> 56:24.725
After what had happened
to you and to your friend.

56:25.698 --> 56:26.956
My friend?

56:26.966 --> 56:30.960
Yeah. I stopped by your room, you know,
because I recognized your name.

56:30.970 --> 56:35.432
My wife, she used to listen to your show
all the time and...

56:35.442 --> 56:39.310
...that was why I stopped you
in the subway.

56:39.546 --> 56:42.181
I just wanted you to know that.

56:43.650 --> 56:45.650
Thank you.

56:48.822 --> 56:51.916
You know, it was disturbing.

56:53.059 --> 56:56.204
It really was. I mean, you were gone.

56:57.263 --> 57:00.323
And to see somebody...

57:00.667 --> 57:03.158
...that can't see you, it....

57:04.037 --> 57:06.037
But you're back now.

57:06.840 --> 57:09.206
Yeah, I'm back now.

57:09.375 --> 57:12.350
A lot of people don't make it back.

57:13.113 --> 57:15.113
I know that.

57:15.782 --> 57:19.149
I know you do. You see...

57:19.819 --> 57:21.344
...I checked into your case.

57:21.354 --> 57:24.653
-You checked into my case?
-Yeah.

57:25.058 --> 57:28.718
We got two of the best detectives
in this city that's working on this...

57:28.728 --> 57:30.923
...and we will find them.

57:31.097 --> 57:33.097
We always do.

57:34.634 --> 57:37.535
Are policemen always so confident?

57:38.638 --> 57:41.018
Are you interviewing me now?

57:42.375 --> 57:44.809
-Yeah, I guess I am.
-Right.

57:45.745 --> 57:47.745
Okay.

57:47.780 --> 57:50.374
How long is this gonna take?

57:50.550 --> 57:54.281
Five minutes, tops.
We can do it over here.

57:56.890 --> 57:58.890
Yeah.

58:01.060 --> 58:04.205
When you first go to a crime scene...

58:04.397 --> 58:07.730
-...what do you look for?
-Evidence.

58:08.234 --> 58:10.193
Okay, such as?

58:10.203 --> 58:12.328
Murder weapon, entry wound...

58:12.338 --> 58:16.001
...DNA samples, prints,
carbon fragments...

58:16.176 --> 58:18.134
...position of the corpse.

58:18.144 --> 58:21.437
It's amazing what a dead body
can tell you.

58:21.447 --> 58:23.406
So the dead do talk?

58:23.416 --> 58:25.816
Oh, yeah. Everybody talks.

58:25.985 --> 58:30.354
Now, most everybody lies.
But the dead can't.

58:30.757 --> 58:35.084
And then again, the lies
tell you things too, because...

58:35.094 --> 58:37.899
...people tell them for a reason.

58:38.064 --> 58:42.625
And those bodies at the subway,
what are they telling you?

58:42.635 --> 58:44.635
You read the paper.

58:44.871 --> 58:47.336
Should I believe what I read?

58:52.278 --> 58:54.473
You ever read about him?

58:57.217 --> 58:58.675
Why do I know him?

58:58.685 --> 59:03.012
That's Mr. Murrow. He owns the parking
out on Roosevelt Island.

59:03.022 --> 59:05.317
But that's not all he does.

59:05.592 --> 59:07.592
What else does he do?

59:10.463 --> 59:13.091
-You really wanna know?
-Yeah.

59:13.433 --> 59:15.813
Then this is off the record.

59:16.069 --> 59:18.069
Okay.

59:22.008 --> 59:26.428
He imports drugs, guns, people.
Whatever's in demand.

59:26.479 --> 59:28.571
Found three guys that had crossed him...

59:28.581 --> 59:33.042
...with their hands Superglued to a table
and expanding cement in their throats.

59:33.052 --> 59:35.278
Had his wife ready
to testify against him...

59:35.288 --> 59:38.548
...and then she's found with her brains
blown out, gun in her hand.

59:38.558 --> 59:40.850
Nothing adds up except his lawyers.

59:40.860 --> 59:43.052
Now he's got custody
of his stepdaughter...

59:43.062 --> 59:45.555
...and not for sentimental reasons.

59:45.565 --> 59:48.157
But he knows she knows something...

59:48.167 --> 59:51.894
...and I hate to think what's
gonna happen to her. But...

59:51.904 --> 59:54.539
...maybe you know a nicer side.

59:58.845 --> 01:00:01.140
And why can't you nail him?

01:00:02.248 --> 01:00:04.373
Because I follow the law.

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:07.110
Well, there's nothing you can do?

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.120
Nothing that's legal.

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:13.858
I didn't say that.

01:00:14.127 --> 01:00:16.127
I didn't hear it.

01:00:21.234 --> 01:00:22.592
Thank you.

01:00:22.602 --> 01:00:24.602
Nothing that's legal.

01:00:28.441 --> 01:00:29.899
So...

01:00:29.909 --> 01:00:32.459
...there's nothing you can do?

01:00:32.812 --> 01:00:36.213
No. No matter how bad I feel about it.

01:00:36.849 --> 01:00:40.243
I petitioned that she be made
a ward of the court...

01:00:40.253 --> 01:00:44.673
...but his lawyers killed that one
stone dead, so....

01:00:46.559 --> 01:00:48.559
Ever shot anyone?

01:00:50.897 --> 01:00:52.897
Yeah.

01:00:53.433 --> 01:00:55.433
Did your hands shake?

01:00:58.271 --> 01:01:00.271
No.

01:01:00.506 --> 01:01:04.467
But that's one of the benefits
of being on the right side.

01:01:04.477 --> 01:01:10.211
A benefit that that asshole and
the subway shooter don't have.

01:01:10.650 --> 01:01:13.285
And you think they're the same?

01:01:14.053 --> 01:01:18.133
They both walked away from a murder,
didn't they?

01:01:18.558 --> 01:01:20.768
Let me ask you a question.

01:01:21.027 --> 01:01:23.027
Just us.

01:01:26.032 --> 01:01:28.091
How did you...

01:01:30.136 --> 01:01:34.471
...pull it back together
after what happened to you?

01:01:36.042 --> 01:01:38.042
You don't.

01:01:38.478 --> 01:01:40.269
I'm sorry.

01:01:40.279 --> 01:01:42.004
-No, no.
-Jacked-up question, man.

01:01:42.014 --> 01:01:44.608
It's a fair question. You....

01:01:47.053 --> 01:01:49.093
You become someone else.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.760
A stranger.

01:02:03.569 --> 01:02:06.329
You must have loved him very much.

01:02:06.339 --> 01:02:08.339
Yeah.

01:02:09.776 --> 01:02:15.811
Sometimes that just makes it harder,
you know. You just wish you didn't.

01:02:16.582 --> 01:02:20.211
So, come on, some more cop stuff.

01:02:20.486 --> 01:02:23.546
-Or are we done?
-No, l-- We're good.

01:02:24.924 --> 01:02:26.749
Thanks.

01:02:26.759 --> 01:02:29.887
And...here.

01:02:30.062 --> 01:02:32.121
That's my card. You--

01:02:32.465 --> 01:02:37.160
You wanna talk about your case,
you can call me. Any time.

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:39.128
I warn you...

01:02:39.138 --> 01:02:41.138
...I don't sleep.

01:02:42.775 --> 01:02:44.775
Neither do l.

01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:13.790
I walk the streets at night now.

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:18.143
I find places and things
I never knew existed.

01:03:18.478 --> 01:03:23.040
But am I finding them
or are they finding me?

01:03:26.886 --> 01:03:28.886
Ever shot anyone?

01:03:29.455 --> 01:03:31.414
Yes.

01:03:31.424 --> 01:03:33.551
Did your hands shake?

01:03:35.962 --> 01:03:41.423
No, that's one of the benefits
of being on the right side.

01:03:41.901 --> 01:03:46.762
That from a police detective covering
last night's subway shooting.

01:03:46.772 --> 01:03:50.852
And like all good cops,
he believes in the law...

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:56.180
...in right and wrong,
and the thin, fragile line between them.

01:03:57.283 --> 01:04:00.768
And he's probably wondering,
as I speak...

01:04:01.587 --> 01:04:04.987
...why is somebody
doing his job for him?

01:04:17.036 --> 01:04:19.036
Hey, baby.

01:04:20.273 --> 01:04:23.436
-Hello.
-What's up, honey?

01:04:23.643 --> 01:04:25.368
Not much.

01:04:25.378 --> 01:04:28.711
So, what would 50 dollars do for you?

01:04:31.717 --> 01:04:34.410
-Shouldn't she be at home?
-She got no home.

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:36.420
Have you, honey?

01:04:39.325 --> 01:04:42.419
-Where to?
-Come on in.

01:04:45.765 --> 01:04:50.355
-You're looking for a show in the back seat?
-Oh, yeah.

01:04:55.675 --> 01:04:57.715
What's your name, honey?

01:04:59.345 --> 01:05:01.345
Chloe.

01:05:01.714 --> 01:05:04.547
What's he got in mind, Chloe?

01:05:05.484 --> 01:05:08.119
The little whore needs a mommy.

01:05:09.155 --> 01:05:11.180
Are you a mommy?

01:05:12.692 --> 01:05:14.785
You're a whore, right?

01:05:14.994 --> 01:05:16.994
I'm collecting whores.

01:05:17.129 --> 01:05:19.388
You know them suicide bombers
over in Iraq?

01:05:19.398 --> 01:05:22.858
When they die they want 72 virgins.
Me, I want whores.

01:05:22.868 --> 01:05:24.460
I want them while I'm alive.

01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:28.720
You know, Chloe and l
are gonna take a little walk.

01:05:31.310 --> 01:05:35.747
-You ain't going nowhere.
-Never get in the car.

01:05:36.782 --> 01:05:39.247
How long have you been in it?

01:05:39.719 --> 01:05:41.719
Four...

01:05:42.788 --> 01:05:46.315
...five, six days.

01:05:46.659 --> 01:05:48.659
Since....

01:05:49.428 --> 01:05:51.726
Since Vegas.

01:05:52.999 --> 01:05:56.127
But you wanna go now, don't you?

01:05:57.003 --> 01:05:58.561
Yes.

01:05:58.571 --> 01:06:01.404
Are you giving me grief again?

01:06:01.574 --> 01:06:04.566
Oh, my, got us a supercunt here.

01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:07.005
Open the doors.

01:06:07.313 --> 01:06:09.071
And if I don't?

01:06:09.081 --> 01:06:13.076
Then I'll be the last supercunt
you'll ever see.

01:06:14.987 --> 01:06:17.146
Get out of the car, Chloe. Go on.

01:06:17.156 --> 01:06:19.156
Not until he pays me.

01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:21.432
All right, pay the girl.

01:06:21.861 --> 01:06:24.762
Come on! Easy.

01:06:31.303 --> 01:06:33.303
All of it.

01:06:35.474 --> 01:06:37.474
All of it!

01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:53.390
Come on, walk.

01:06:53.492 --> 01:06:57.121
Don't turn around. Just keep going.

01:06:58.364 --> 01:07:01.691
You got a family back there, Chloe,
in Vegas?

01:07:01.701 --> 01:07:04.829
No. I went there from Albuquerque.

01:07:05.004 --> 01:07:08.914
Well, you got enough money
to get you home now.

01:07:11.811 --> 01:07:13.811
Ain't you a sad whore?

01:07:13.846 --> 01:07:15.846
Get out of the way!

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:29.919
Hey. Hey!

01:07:29.929 --> 01:07:32.819
You're okay. You're okay, come on.

01:07:33.099 --> 01:07:35.124
Let me turn you over.

01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:39.032
All right. I'm so sorry. Here.

01:07:41.907 --> 01:07:43.903
Is this...

01:07:43.913 --> 01:07:45.468
...still America?

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:47.605
Yeah. Your leg is broken.

01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:52.447
Who the hell are you?

01:07:53.185 --> 01:07:55.185
I'm nobody.

01:08:03.529 --> 01:08:05.654
There is no going back...

01:08:05.798 --> 01:08:07.798
...to that other.

01:08:07.933 --> 01:08:09.933
She is gone.

01:08:10.169 --> 01:08:13.900
This thing, this stranger...

01:08:14.273 --> 01:08:16.468
...it's all you are now.

01:08:22.948 --> 01:08:25.040
You walking out the heat?

01:08:25.050 --> 01:08:27.050
Yeah.

01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:29.620
Are you all right?

01:08:29.854 --> 01:08:32.149
Your hands are cold as ice.

01:08:33.959 --> 01:08:36.621
Your lipstick is smudged.

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:42.663
Erica. Erica!

01:08:46.471 --> 01:08:48.663
You never said my name before.

01:08:48.674 --> 01:08:50.533
I heard your show.

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:52.568
Right and wrong?

01:08:57.216 --> 01:09:00.042
Ballistic tests have linked
last night's shooting...

01:09:00.051 --> 01:09:03.779
...with the shooting from the market
and the shooting from the subway, so....

01:09:03.788 --> 01:09:07.683
Are you saying--? Are you saying the
same gun was used in all three shootings?

01:09:07.693 --> 01:09:09.618
Well, that seems to be the case.

01:09:09.627 --> 01:09:10.986
Detective.

01:09:10.996 --> 01:09:14.023
Sources are saying the witness
can provide a description...

01:09:14.033 --> 01:09:17.225
-...but has refused to talk.
-I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

01:09:17.236 --> 01:09:21.316
Has the witness refused
to provide a description?

01:09:22.207 --> 01:09:24.502
No, the witness is awake...

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:29.932
...and she is coherent, and we will be
interviewing her shortly.

01:09:30.783 --> 01:09:34.009
Now, thank you, that's everything.
Chief.

01:09:34.019 --> 01:09:35.778
Please, everybody, please.

01:09:35.787 --> 01:09:38.747
That's all the information
we're prepared to release.

01:09:38.756 --> 01:09:40.756
Thank you very much.

01:09:47.299 --> 01:09:49.299
Hey.

01:09:49.969 --> 01:09:53.761
-You handled yourself really well back there.
-I tried.

01:09:53.772 --> 01:09:57.566
So, what, is this guy
becoming an obsession with you?

01:09:57.576 --> 01:10:00.136
No, my interest is in you.

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.080
Why me?

01:10:03.115 --> 01:10:08.640
Well, because you seem like a good man,
you know? Like a good cop.

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:12.681
Yeah, well, ain't nobody
doing my job for me.

01:10:12.691 --> 01:10:14.650
You heard my show.

01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:16.318
Yeah.

01:10:16.328 --> 01:10:19.255
You gotta think every one of those
reporters in that room...

01:10:19.265 --> 01:10:21.985
...is gonna sensationalize this.

01:10:22.434 --> 01:10:24.126
But not you.

01:10:24.136 --> 01:10:26.176
You're better than that.

01:10:27.907 --> 01:10:29.907
How can you tell?

01:10:31.410 --> 01:10:32.801
Your show.

01:10:32.811 --> 01:10:35.644
-My show?
-Yeah.

01:10:36.448 --> 01:10:38.643
You see, my wife...

01:10:38.851 --> 01:10:41.210
-...she didn't listen to it.
-No?

01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:43.220
I did.

01:10:44.957 --> 01:10:47.516
Well, you don't fit our audience profile.

01:10:47.526 --> 01:10:51.320
-Yeah, and you don't fit your voice either.
-I don't?

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:56.175
No, you're a whole lot cuter
and about 100 pounds lighter.

01:10:59.838 --> 01:11:01.838
How's the girl doing?

01:11:02.908 --> 01:11:07.838
She's pretty banged up.
Yeah, but we'll know more tomorrow.

01:11:08.314 --> 01:11:10.314
Well....

01:11:11.717 --> 01:11:13.742
I hope she's all right.

01:11:13.986 --> 01:11:15.986
Yeah.

01:11:27.366 --> 01:11:29.366
-Hi.
-Hey.

01:11:30.803 --> 01:11:32.928
You see those pictures
of the subway thing?

01:11:32.938 --> 01:11:34.997
-Gross.
-They shot another one last night.

01:11:35.007 --> 01:11:37.967
-Some pervert.
-Who will they go for next, Donald Trump?

01:11:37.977 --> 01:11:40.602
-No, that's incitement.
-And justified.

01:11:40.612 --> 01:11:43.505
-Wish he'd take care of my ex.
-You think that's funny?

01:11:43.515 --> 01:11:46.275
I suppose you think
lethal injection's funny too.

01:11:46.285 --> 01:11:49.578
-Funny like strange, or funny "ha, ha"?
-You're sick, you know that?

01:11:49.588 --> 01:11:51.588
You're all sick.

01:11:58.597 --> 01:12:03.058
I'm thinking about opening up your show.
I want you to take phone-ins.

01:12:03.068 --> 01:12:06.162
-On what?
-You heard them.

01:12:06.405 --> 01:12:09.732
You mean the shootings?
The vigilante thing?

01:12:09.742 --> 01:12:13.102
-You really think that that's appropriate?
-Why not?

01:12:13.112 --> 01:12:16.305
Well, I thought you said
you didn't like that kind of thing.

01:12:16.315 --> 01:12:19.409
I don't. But you're good at it.

01:12:19.718 --> 01:12:23.245
-How am I good at it?
-You're a survivor.

01:12:23.422 --> 01:12:26.448
-I'm not asking you to personalize it.
-Oh, you're not?

01:12:26.458 --> 01:12:29.008
No more than you already have.

01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:33.544
"The essential American soul is hard...

01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:37.463
...isolate, stoic, and a killer.

01:12:37.636 --> 01:12:39.934
It has never yet melted."

01:12:40.406 --> 01:12:42.531
I quote that from D.H. Lawrence...

01:12:42.541 --> 01:12:46.101
...because someone
is playing God out there...

01:12:46.111 --> 01:12:49.271
...killing in the name of justice,
in this...

01:12:49.281 --> 01:12:52.107
...the safest big city in the world.

01:12:52.117 --> 01:12:57.146
And because I've been asked today to do
something that we've never done before:

01:12:57.156 --> 01:12:59.448
Take calls from our listeners
on the subject.

01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:02.384
This is a new departure for us but
we wanna hear from you...

01:13:02.394 --> 01:13:07.730
...so call 212-165-9990.

01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:10.893
First caller. Hi, you're on the air.

01:13:10.903 --> 01:13:14.029
As far as I'm concerned,
he's doing us a favor.

01:13:14.039 --> 01:13:15.230
And why is that?

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:17.399
Because no matter what
the media tells us...

01:13:17.409 --> 01:13:20.135
...crimes are being committed,
and he's cleaning it up.

01:13:20.145 --> 01:13:22.237
And you think
he has the right to do that.

01:13:22.247 --> 01:13:24.907
-Well, yeah.
-Next caller. You're on the air.

01:13:24.917 --> 01:13:26.942
You're talking about murder.

01:13:26.952 --> 01:13:28.911
The death penalty without a trial.

01:13:28.921 --> 01:13:32.514
The vigilante is just like the people
he's killing. He should be in jail.

01:13:32.524 --> 01:13:35.551
Well, maybe he will. Next caller.
You're on the air.

01:13:35.561 --> 01:13:38.387
It's less about what he's doing
than how it makes us feel.

01:13:38.397 --> 01:13:39.955
There's not a person I know...

01:13:39.965 --> 01:13:42.391
...doesn't get a jolt of
pleasure when they hear--

01:13:42.401 --> 01:13:44.893
-Pleasure?
- Yeah, revenge makes us feel good.

01:13:44.903 --> 01:13:47.329
That's why we have war,
why we got the death--

01:13:47.339 --> 01:13:50.666
-Next caller, you 're on the air.
-I think it's good for New York.

01:13:50.676 --> 01:13:53.168
I mean, this city
was turning into Disneyland.

01:13:53.178 --> 01:13:56.638
-We're getting our street cred back.
-Next caller. You 're on the air.

01:13:56.648 --> 01:14:00.909
What is wrong with our society, that this
kind of thing can even get on radio?

01:14:00.919 --> 01:14:03.979
Revenge, murder, vigilante killings?

01:14:04.089 --> 01:14:07.049
Hasn't the whole Iraqi debacle
taught us anything?

01:14:07.059 --> 01:14:08.917
"Waste the bad guys, bring them on."

01:14:08.927 --> 01:14:11.653
I've been a fan of yours.
I can't even believe you 're--

01:14:11.663 --> 01:14:13.555
Neither can l. You ' re on the air.

01:14:13.565 --> 01:14:17.493
I wonder if the vigilante has a girlfriend
because there's something sexy about--

01:14:17.503 --> 01:14:19.428
-Sexy?
- Yeah, completely.

01:14:19.438 --> 01:14:22.030
And if he 's listening, my number is 2--

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:24.867
-You ' re on the line.
-This is the vigilante calling.

01:14:24.877 --> 01:14:30.062
I'm the man that takes care of business.
That chick can have--

01:14:37.289 --> 01:14:41.416
-I need to talk to someone.
-Ma'am, can I help you?

01:14:41.426 --> 01:14:43.426
Yeah.

01:14:44.796 --> 01:14:46.922
I need to talk to someone
about a homicide.

01:14:46.932 --> 01:14:48.932
Names?

01:14:50.068 --> 01:14:52.068
Erica Bain.

01:14:52.104 --> 01:14:54.104
She was the victim?

01:14:55.407 --> 01:14:58.968
No. She wasn't the victim.

01:15:00.379 --> 01:15:02.379
She was the....

01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:06.485
-She's....
-No "Erica Bain" under homicide.

01:15:07.352 --> 01:15:11.602
-Well, maybe there should be. You know?
-Pardon me?

01:15:14.393 --> 01:15:16.393
Nothing.

01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:21.123
You gonna give me
some Radiohead too?

01:15:21.133 --> 01:15:22.591
Fucking woman!

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:26.594
Are you a mommy?
You're a whore, right?

01:15:29.408 --> 01:15:31.408
Erica?

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:35.946
Is that you?

01:15:37.783 --> 01:15:40.842
-Because I could not stop for Death...
-Erica?

01:15:40.852 --> 01:15:43.111
...he kindly stopped for me.

01:15:43.121 --> 01:15:44.446
Erica?

01:15:44.456 --> 01:15:48.083
The carriage held but just ourselves.
And Immortality.

01:15:48.093 --> 01:15:50.093
Erica?

01:16:05.611 --> 01:16:07.302
Mercer.

01:16:07.312 --> 01:16:09.312
Hey, it's me, Erica.

01:16:11.183 --> 01:16:13.183
I know.

01:16:13.218 --> 01:16:16.023
-ls everything okay?
- Yeah, l....

01:16:17.389 --> 01:16:22.744
I just wanted to talk and l--
For some reason, I thought of you.

01:16:23.462 --> 01:16:25.462
Okay.

01:16:26.298 --> 01:16:28.298
What's going on?

01:16:28.834 --> 01:16:31.894
What do you do when you can't sleep?

01:16:34.336 --> 01:16:36.546
-Nothing.
-Isn't that hard?

01:16:37.072 --> 01:16:39.072
To do nothing?

01:16:39.841 --> 01:16:42.646
Well, you sort of get used to it.

01:16:52.154 --> 01:16:54.012
Erica?

01:16:54.022 --> 01:16:56.248
Well, come on, what's happening?
Talk to me.

01:16:56.258 --> 01:17:00.352
Did you sleep better
when your wife was beside you?

01:17:00.362 --> 01:17:02.362
I know I did.

01:17:03.165 --> 01:17:08.435
I couldn't feel my body unless his arms
were wrapped around me.

01:17:08.837 --> 01:17:11.812
Yeah, well, my wife, she used to...

01:17:12.507 --> 01:17:14.717
...flip through the night.

01:17:15.210 --> 01:17:18.043
So I called her a mackerel.

01:17:19.781 --> 01:17:24.543
I guess that's not the worst thing
in the world to wake up to.

01:17:24.553 --> 01:17:28.246
Hey, you want me to stay on the phone
with you until you go to sleep?

01:17:28.256 --> 01:17:30.256
No.

01:17:31.026 --> 01:17:33.026
You've been good to me.

01:17:34.329 --> 01:17:36.329
Sleep tight.

01:17:50.278 --> 01:17:52.278
Yeah.

01:17:52.314 --> 01:17:54.139
How late?

01:17:54.149 --> 01:18:00.609
Look, I'm not busting your balls. You
told me it'd be there and it better be.

01:18:34.789 --> 01:18:37.148
Why do you think you can hurt people?

01:18:37.158 --> 01:18:40.218
-What?
-Just do damage and walk away.

01:18:40.662 --> 01:18:42.621
Don't you know what you leave behind?

01:18:42.631 --> 01:18:45.861
-Do I know you?
-Do you think about it?

01:18:46.334 --> 01:18:48.799
Does it keep you up at night?

01:18:49.638 --> 01:18:52.163
-Does it haunt you?
-Excuse me?

01:18:52.173 --> 01:18:53.598
Because it haunts me.

01:18:53.608 --> 01:18:55.967
Are you one of them
press paparazzo freaks?

01:18:55.977 --> 01:18:58.370
You got a fucking camera there?

01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:00.672
You can't take my fucking picture.

01:19:00.682 --> 01:19:06.207
You're gonna come to my fucking place
and take my fucking picture?

01:19:06.988 --> 01:19:08.984
You fuck!

01:19:08.994 --> 01:19:11.788
-You a fucking cop?
-You wish.

01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:15.420
Well, it looks like he fell from up there.

01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:19.457
Cause of death could be the fall.
It could be the crowbar stuck in his skull.

01:19:19.467 --> 01:19:21.697
I'd say 50-50 either way.

01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:23.762
Shit.

01:19:23.772 --> 01:19:25.772
Maybe 70-30.

01:19:26.574 --> 01:19:30.835
I mean, come on, man. How many people
wanted this prick dead? Besides us?

01:19:30.845 --> 01:19:34.906
Too many.
The problem is he knew all of them.

01:19:35.083 --> 01:19:37.475
He wouldn't let anybody
get this close to him.

01:19:37.485 --> 01:19:41.179
You think someone did us a favor?
Maybe we should put him on the payroll.

01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:44.015
What, like someone think
they're doing our job for us?

01:19:44.025 --> 01:19:47.385
Saying, "Hey, New York's finest,
I'm gonna send you a little message.

01:19:47.395 --> 01:19:49.395
This is how it's done."

01:19:49.531 --> 01:19:51.222
-Get a shot right there.
-Officer!

01:19:51.232 --> 01:19:53.992
Here we go. All right, I'll be back.

01:19:54.002 --> 01:19:56.227
Erica, are you okay? Oh, my God.

01:19:56.237 --> 01:19:58.467
-Get out.
-My God!

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:01.575
-Get away!
-No, I won't get away.

01:20:02.477 --> 01:20:05.537
Don't touch me. I'm sick!

01:20:06.014 --> 01:20:08.141
I can see that.

01:20:12.687 --> 01:20:15.547
-We have to get you to a hospital.
-No.

01:20:15.557 --> 01:20:16.948
No.

01:20:16.958 --> 01:20:19.927
-Why not?
-I can't because....

01:20:20.128 --> 01:20:22.426
Oh, God. I can't.

01:20:24.466 --> 01:20:27.333
What kind of trouble are you in?

01:20:28.436 --> 01:20:30.436
You don't wanna know.

01:21:23.291 --> 01:21:25.418
Were you a nurse?

01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:27.821
When I had to be.

01:21:29.464 --> 01:21:32.092
This is going to leave a scar.

01:21:36.871 --> 01:21:39.567
I killed a man tonight.

01:21:41.176 --> 01:21:43.736
Because he did this to you?

01:21:44.979 --> 01:21:46.979
No.

01:21:48.016 --> 01:21:50.610
I would've killed him anyway.

01:21:54.289 --> 01:21:56.289
Back home...

01:21:56.858 --> 01:21:59.884
...they gave young boys guns.

01:22:01.396 --> 01:22:03.861
Made them kill their parents.

01:22:04.499 --> 01:22:06.763
Just to show us...

01:22:08.336 --> 01:22:10.295
...anyone...

01:22:10.305 --> 01:22:12.432
...can cross that line.

01:22:14.375 --> 01:22:16.843
Anyone can be a killer.

01:22:19.581 --> 01:22:22.243
Each death leaves a hole...

01:22:22.817 --> 01:22:24.978
...waiting to be filled.

01:22:33.194 --> 01:22:36.254
Did the ME come back
with his liver temperature yet?

01:22:36.264 --> 01:22:40.492
Yeah, he's about-- Dead about two hours
from when we got there.

01:22:40.502 --> 01:22:45.599
-So that puts us at what time?
-About 1:00, give or take.

01:22:46.341 --> 01:22:48.341
Damn.

01:22:48.576 --> 01:22:53.338
Okay, I want everyone from the subway
and from that market killing...

01:22:53.348 --> 01:22:56.441
-...I want them all brought in again.
-We've done all of that.

01:22:56.451 --> 01:22:59.444
We need to do it again.
We need to think outside the box.

01:22:59.454 --> 01:23:02.447
But he hit him with a crowbar,
hefted him over the rail.

01:23:02.457 --> 01:23:07.085
We're talking about a different guy
here, man. Think about it.

01:23:07.095 --> 01:23:09.095
Maybe.

01:23:09.397 --> 01:23:12.857
What about the iPod?
You said it traced back to a kid.

01:23:12.867 --> 01:23:15.527
I thought I told you.
The kid's father is an attorney.

01:23:15.537 --> 01:23:17.795
-He wants a subpoena, but I'm on it.
-Get him.

01:23:17.805 --> 01:23:22.565
-Whatever you gotta do--
-All right. I'll call right now.

01:23:28.416 --> 01:23:30.416
Hey, Erica.

01:23:31.386 --> 01:23:34.446
No, I just wanna know how you slept.

01:23:35.023 --> 01:23:37.488
Hey, you wanna see what I do?

01:23:38.059 --> 01:23:43.121
Well, meet me over at Wynnward Hospital
in Washington Heights.

01:23:43.131 --> 01:23:45.156
You'll get an idea.

01:23:45.833 --> 01:23:51.783
East 14 and Broadway, East 14 and
Broadway. None confirmed at the time.

01:23:56.711 --> 01:23:58.921
Why doesn't he march here?

01:23:58.947 --> 01:24:02.073
-March down the street.
-Ethan Grant, my man.

01:24:02.083 --> 01:24:04.745
Now sit your hippie ass down.

01:24:04.919 --> 01:24:06.919
You smoking pot?

01:24:06.955 --> 01:24:10.081
-I need to talk to you.
-My dad said not to get involved.

01:24:10.091 --> 01:24:13.151
Oh, yeah? Does your dad know
you smoke grass, huh?

01:24:13.161 --> 01:24:15.954
That's a lot more than
a misdemeanor these days.

01:24:15.964 --> 01:24:18.489
-Listen, I didn't see anything.
-I think you did.

01:24:18.499 --> 01:24:22.239
-Look at me. Hey, you selling this shit?
-No.

01:24:22.270 --> 01:24:23.761
Well, I believe you.

01:24:23.771 --> 01:24:29.721
Maybe a judge won't. Come on, Skippy.
Get your shit. Let's go. Come on.

01:24:35.216 --> 01:24:37.241
-Hey. Thanks for coming.
-Hey.

01:24:37.251 --> 01:24:38.610
Sure.

01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:41.680
-Nice jacket.
-Thanks.

01:24:42.123 --> 01:24:44.515
So, what time
you got to sleep last night?

01:24:44.525 --> 01:24:47.185
I don't know, pretty soon
after we hung up, I guess.

01:24:47.195 --> 01:24:50.760
-About 1, 1:30?
-Yeah. Something like that.

01:24:50.770 --> 01:24:54.132
Yeah. I ended up working all night.

01:24:55.503 --> 01:24:59.063
You know you're not gonna be able
to reference this on your show?

01:24:59.073 --> 01:25:01.623
Sure, if I knew what this was.

01:25:01.809 --> 01:25:05.634
We're gonna interview
a witness to a shooting.

01:25:05.847 --> 01:25:08.673
-Isn't that against procedure?
-Yeah.

01:25:08.683 --> 01:25:10.742
But I've tried to talk to her twice...

01:25:10.752 --> 01:25:13.378
...and she seemed real nervous
to talk to me.

01:25:13.388 --> 01:25:16.080
I figure maybe if you were there,
she'll talk.

01:25:16.090 --> 01:25:17.982
Why me?

01:25:17.992 --> 01:25:20.287
Because you got me to talk.

01:25:29.904 --> 01:25:31.904
Hi, Chloe.

01:25:34.642 --> 01:25:36.767
How are we feeling today?

01:25:37.545 --> 01:25:39.545
All right.

01:25:43.685 --> 01:25:45.685
I brought a friend.

01:25:49.257 --> 01:25:51.257
Hi, Chloe.

01:25:56.531 --> 01:25:58.531
Hi.

01:26:12.947 --> 01:26:18.302
So you feel like telling me what happened
to you that night now?

01:26:33.134 --> 01:26:35.534
That's a pretty necklace.

01:26:44.846 --> 01:26:47.736
You should tell them what you saw.

01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:51.585
Whatever it was, tell them the truth.

01:26:55.923 --> 01:26:57.923
It's okay.

01:27:01.963 --> 01:27:03.963
I saw....

01:27:10.338 --> 01:27:12.568
I saw nobody.

01:27:15.042 --> 01:27:19.122
Come on, Chloe.
Tell me the truth now, all right?

01:27:20.915 --> 01:27:22.915
And nobody saw me.

01:27:31.159 --> 01:27:33.159
Okay.

01:27:33.361 --> 01:27:35.401
Sorry if that upset you.

01:27:36.631 --> 01:27:40.124
Well, I'm sorry that
I couldn't be more help back there.

01:27:40.134 --> 01:27:43.227
Well, you definitely seemed to help her.

01:27:43.237 --> 01:27:45.467
She sure liked your...

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:47.532
...necklace.

01:27:47.542 --> 01:27:49.542
It meant a lot to me.

01:27:58.386 --> 01:28:00.386
Erica?

01:28:00.922 --> 01:28:04.619
-Yeah.
-Why'd you call me last night?

01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:08.125
I told you, I couldn't sleep.

01:28:09.497 --> 01:28:11.497
And you were in bed?

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:15.567
No. I couldn't sleep.

01:28:25.313 --> 01:28:28.039
You wanna tell us again
why you didn't wanna come in?

01:28:28.049 --> 01:28:31.742
-For what? To get back my iPod?
-Hey, watch your ass.

01:28:31.752 --> 01:28:34.612
I don't know. I had mixed feelings.

01:28:34.622 --> 01:28:37.415
I mean, I was kind of glad
those guys got killed.

01:28:37.425 --> 01:28:41.219
-You were glad?
-Yeah. I know I shouldn't be, but I was.

01:28:41.229 --> 01:28:45.489
-While we're young, give us a statement.
-Look, I didn't see any vigilante.

01:28:45.499 --> 01:28:47.758
Those guys smacked me around
and took my iPod.

01:28:47.768 --> 01:28:50.695
Then they hassled some black dude
sitting next to his kid...

01:28:50.705 --> 01:28:54.832
...so we all got off,
except for some woman at the back.

01:28:54.842 --> 01:28:56.634
A woman.

01:28:56.644 --> 01:29:00.238
Yeah, just a woman.
She was staying out of it.

01:29:00.248 --> 01:29:02.506
Maybe the vigi guy got on
at the next stop.

01:29:02.516 --> 01:29:07.511
Can you describe this woman well enough
for an artist to make a sketch?

01:29:07.521 --> 01:29:09.517
I can try.

01:29:09.527 --> 01:29:12.216
Where are you going
with this woman thing?

01:29:12.226 --> 01:29:14.226
I'm not sure yet.

01:29:15.129 --> 01:29:20.024
Women kill their kids, their husbands,
boyfriends, shit they love.

01:29:20.034 --> 01:29:21.726
They don't do this.

01:29:21.736 --> 01:29:23.427
-How you doing?
-They don't?

01:29:23.437 --> 01:29:25.096
-Good.
-You need some more water?

01:29:25.106 --> 01:29:26.764
-Nope.
-Okay.

01:29:26.774 --> 01:29:30.034
Just think about the first moment
that you met her. All right?

01:29:30.044 --> 01:29:32.570
Where you were, where she was.

01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:35.640
Tell me anything that comes to mind.

01:29:36.217 --> 01:29:38.597
She had light hair, I think.

01:29:39.921 --> 01:29:44.620
And okay lips. And she was skinny.

01:29:44.792 --> 01:29:49.855
But she had some ass.
You know, you could tell because--

01:29:50.264 --> 01:29:53.825
-But you're not doing the ass, right?
-No.

01:29:54.001 --> 01:29:56.001
Okay.

01:29:56.904 --> 01:29:58.904
She had good skin.

01:30:00.074 --> 01:30:02.033
It was smooth.

01:30:02.043 --> 01:30:04.876
And nice breasts.

01:30:05.046 --> 01:30:08.639
Yeah. Like, they were little,
like Kate Moss titties.

01:30:08.649 --> 01:30:11.409
-But they looked good with--
-Try to focus on the face.

01:30:11.419 --> 01:30:13.419
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:30:14.622 --> 01:30:17.481
-Hey, you know what I do remember?
-What?

01:30:17.491 --> 01:30:19.786
She was, like, on lockdown.

01:30:20.828 --> 01:30:24.559
I mean, shut off. Kind of scary.

01:31:16.584 --> 01:31:18.584
"It's not cream.

01:31:20.688 --> 01:31:22.986
It's vanilla."

01:31:30.998 --> 01:31:33.466
You left a hole in me.

01:31:36.637 --> 01:31:38.637
But I'm done now.

01:31:39.573 --> 01:31:41.573
You hear me?

01:31:44.612 --> 01:31:46.612
I'm done now.

01:31:50.918 --> 01:31:54.678
Great. It's Jennifer Aniston.
I knew he was bullshitting us.

01:31:54.688 --> 01:31:57.715
No, not really. This is a phenomenon
that happens quite often.

01:31:57.725 --> 01:32:00.151
The mind gets so saturated
with popular images...

01:32:00.161 --> 01:32:04.355
...it's often difficult, especially for people
under 20, to recall something unique.

01:32:04.365 --> 01:32:05.923
That's Mr. Murrow.

01:32:05.933 --> 01:32:11.228
He owns the parking out on
Roosevelt Island. That's not all he does.

01:32:11.238 --> 01:32:12.863
What else does he do?

01:32:12.873 --> 01:32:15.774
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah.

01:32:15.943 --> 01:32:19.003
-Then this is off the record.
-Erica!

01:32:19.747 --> 01:32:21.743
Who is it?

01:32:21.753 --> 01:32:26.254
It's Detective Mercer.
Could I have a minute with you?

01:32:27.154 --> 01:32:29.452
Yeah. Yeah, just a second.

01:32:40.734 --> 01:32:42.734
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:32:42.837 --> 01:32:46.063
I tried to call, but there was no answer.

01:32:46.073 --> 01:32:48.073
The ringer must be off.

01:32:48.776 --> 01:32:52.872
-Can I come in?
-Yeah, sure. Come on in.

01:33:00.354 --> 01:33:04.349
-It's pretty dark in here.
-I like it like that.

01:33:08.696 --> 01:33:10.696
Got something....

01:33:13.033 --> 01:33:15.033
Is this yours?

01:33:17.638 --> 01:33:21.335
-Where'd you find it?
-Spanish Harlem.

01:33:21.942 --> 01:33:27.141
A uniform pinched the suspect's girlfriend
trying to pawn it.

01:33:27.581 --> 01:33:30.726
He fit the description that you gave.

01:33:32.686 --> 01:33:34.686
Oh, my God.

01:33:34.788 --> 01:33:36.828
I need a favor from you.

01:33:36.891 --> 01:33:41.651
I'd like for you to come downtown
and ID him in a lineup.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.858
No. I can't.

01:33:47.868 --> 01:33:52.966
I understand you're nervous,
but you won't be alone in there.

01:33:52.976 --> 01:33:54.973
I promise.

01:34:00.114 --> 01:34:02.114
I'll get my stuff.

01:34:05.553 --> 01:34:07.553
Thanks.

01:34:32.146 --> 01:34:34.146
Okay, let's go.

01:34:34.448 --> 01:34:38.275
You're going to view five subjects,
and then I'm gonna ask you three questions:

01:34:38.285 --> 01:34:43.847
Do you recognize anyone? Where do you
know them from? And what did they do?

01:34:43.857 --> 01:34:45.950
Lights and blinds.

01:34:48.429 --> 01:34:51.149
Number one, approach the mirror.

01:34:55.903 --> 01:34:57.761
No.

01:34:57.771 --> 01:35:01.256
Sit down.
Number two, approach the mirror.

01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:05.202
No.

01:35:05.212 --> 01:35:08.867
Sit down.
Number three, approach the mirror.

01:35:20.094 --> 01:35:22.094
No.

01:35:22.196 --> 01:35:25.766
Sit down.
Number four, approach the mirror.

01:35:28.469 --> 01:35:31.562
I can see them all. It's none of them.

01:35:31.572 --> 01:35:34.234
Sit down. You're sure?

01:35:34.408 --> 01:35:37.104
Yeah. I'm sorry.

01:35:38.345 --> 01:35:40.345
I really am.

01:35:41.649 --> 01:35:43.649
I'm so sorry.

01:35:49.156 --> 01:35:53.050
Damn, I thought we had him.
You think she just froze up?

01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:55.319
Doesn't really seem like the type,
you know?

01:35:55.329 --> 01:35:57.329
I don't know.

01:36:01.201 --> 01:36:03.726
-You okay?
-Yeah.

01:36:03.904 --> 01:36:06.363
That looked like
it was pretty tough on you.

01:36:06.373 --> 01:36:10.434
It was. I was kind of hoping
I was finally done.

01:36:10.611 --> 01:36:13.771
Yeah, well, I'm off now.
Let's go get some food.

01:36:13.781 --> 01:36:18.371
-No, I'm not hungry. That's okay.
-No, you need to eat.

01:36:20.621 --> 01:36:23.522
I can barely remember his hands.

01:36:23.791 --> 01:36:26.089
Perhaps you need to forget.

01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:28.960
I can't.

01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:32.162
I miss who I was with him.

01:36:34.134 --> 01:36:36.134
You know that feeling?

01:36:39.606 --> 01:36:41.606
You know...

01:36:41.975 --> 01:36:46.820
...this is Mughal. It was a gift
from David's grandmother.

01:36:51.885 --> 01:36:53.910
Speaking of gifts....

01:36:56.056 --> 01:36:59.683
You know, someone gave me
a gift the other night.

01:36:59.693 --> 01:37:01.693
Yeah?

01:37:03.497 --> 01:37:08.230
You recall that guy we saw on TV
at the coffee shop?

01:37:09.303 --> 01:37:13.933
The one I've been trying to put away
for three years.

01:37:15.242 --> 01:37:18.202
Apparently somebody else
must've had something against him...

01:37:18.212 --> 01:37:22.122
...because we're not talking
about a 9 mm here.

01:37:22.316 --> 01:37:26.480
It got real personal.

01:37:27.121 --> 01:37:29.121
Yeah, I read about it.

01:37:37.831 --> 01:37:42.251
We got some more information
on that subway shooting.

01:37:44.271 --> 01:37:47.586
Turns out there was a woman on the car.

01:37:47.875 --> 01:37:52.870
Now, all this time, we've been looking
for a man with a gun.

01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:55.440
It was a woman with a grudge.

01:37:58.152 --> 01:38:01.807
Well, I guess there's a lot of us
out there.

01:38:08.362 --> 01:38:11.677
You know, Erica, when I was a rookie...

01:38:13.634 --> 01:38:16.609
...I used to give myself this test.

01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:22.866
I would ask myself, if there was someone
that I knew that had committed a crime...

01:38:22.876 --> 01:38:26.786
...would I have the fortitude
to put them away?

01:38:28.248 --> 01:38:30.248
What kind of someone?

01:38:30.918 --> 01:38:36.788
Someone close to me.
Like the best friend I could ever....

01:38:37.858 --> 01:38:40.326
I could ever hope to have.

01:38:43.297 --> 01:38:45.297
And...?

01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:52.790
I always hoped that I would have
the courage and the dedication to say yes.

01:38:53.941 --> 01:38:55.941
And do you?

01:38:56.810 --> 01:38:58.810
I do.

01:38:59.379 --> 01:39:02.609
And it's important that you know that.

01:39:04.585 --> 01:39:06.585
I know that.

01:39:07.988 --> 01:39:10.479
It's what I admire about you.

01:39:20.567 --> 01:39:24.901
One more piece of evidence,
and she goes down.

01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:29.220
And I'm sure you'll find it.

01:39:29.877 --> 01:39:34.610
You're a good detective.
You miss nothing.

01:39:37.651 --> 01:39:39.651
I have to go.

01:39:41.822 --> 01:39:44.256
-I got it.
-Okay.

01:39:44.424 --> 01:39:46.424
Hang on.

01:39:46.727 --> 01:39:48.727
Hey.

01:39:57.404 --> 01:40:01.824
-I wonder what David would think of--
-Think of what?

01:40:05.812 --> 01:40:08.303
This woman with a grudge.

01:40:12.819 --> 01:40:14.819
I don't know.

01:40:16.924 --> 01:40:18.983
The dead don't talk.

01:40:20.561 --> 01:40:22.561
At least not to me.

01:40:44.284 --> 01:40:46.284
All right, thanks.

01:41:11.311 --> 01:41:13.711
Hey, can I get Joey Mortell?

01:41:18.085 --> 01:41:19.476
Crackheads.

01:41:19.486 --> 01:41:23.481
I got you stuck in traffic,
88th and 3rd Avenue.

01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:28.085
Pull over at the corner, Roma 's Pizza.
Get yourself a slice.

01:41:28.095 --> 01:41:31.688
-No, I'm not gonna be here that long.
- You are gonna be there that long...

01:41:31.698 --> 01:41:35.225
...because I got traffic backed up on 3rd
all the way to 96th Street.

01:41:35.235 --> 01:41:39.129
-Make yourself comfortable.
-Well, I need you to do me a favor, okay?

01:41:39.139 --> 01:41:44.068
Can you run a trace on a call?
And I don't have a subpoena.

01:41:44.078 --> 01:41:46.287
But you'll get one, right?

01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:48.680
Yeah, if I have to.

01:41:49.549 --> 01:41:51.549
All right.

01:41:52.185 --> 01:41:54.344
Give me the date and the time.

01:41:54.354 --> 01:41:56.564
Two days ago, July 20th...

01:41:57.324 --> 01:41:59.619
...between 12 and 1:30 a.m.

01:41:59.726 --> 01:42:02.653
All right. Okay, I need the number.

01:42:02.663 --> 01:42:04.663
Hold on.

01:42:07.534 --> 01:42:10.298
-It's 917...
-Yeah.

01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:15.373
-... 157- 1431.
-All right, give me the name.

01:42:15.542 --> 01:42:18.841
Look, it's private, like I said.

01:42:19.012 --> 01:42:21.004
Okay, it's that kind of private. I see.

01:42:21.014 --> 01:42:24.207
All right. Okay, yeah, I got you covered.

01:42:24.217 --> 01:42:27.872
-Okay, just call me, all right?
-You got it.

01:42:34.428 --> 01:42:36.638
You seen this ring before?

01:42:37.330 --> 01:42:39.330
It looks familiar.

01:42:49.276 --> 01:42:52.575
I got a name. Shauna Nelson.

01:42:52.746 --> 01:42:54.771
An address, a cell phone.

01:42:54.781 --> 01:42:56.707
What'd she look like?

01:42:56.717 --> 01:43:01.878
She had two eyes, a mouth and a nose,
right in the middle of her face.

01:43:01.888 --> 01:43:04.608
Please get the fuck out of here.

01:43:19.339 --> 01:43:21.339
Yeah.

01:43:26.813 --> 01:43:30.180
Shut up. Shut up. That is--

01:43:31.918 --> 01:43:33.918
It's true.

01:43:34.488 --> 01:43:36.488
Hello?

01:43:36.890 --> 01:43:38.890
Hello?

01:43:38.925 --> 01:43:40.517
-Do you know this number?
-No.

01:43:40.527 --> 01:43:42.757
Are you sure? 917.

01:43:42.929 --> 01:43:46.089
Hey, you guys, are 917-- Fuck you guys.
I'll see you later, okay?

01:43:46.099 --> 01:43:48.099
-Bye.
-Later.

01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:09.320
Hey!

01:44:11.591 --> 01:44:13.817
-Are you Shauna?
-Did you just call me?

01:44:13.827 --> 01:44:19.182
Yeah, l-- I got your number from
the pawn shop. You had my ring.

01:44:19.699 --> 01:44:22.526
Yeah. Motherfucker fucks some slut...

01:44:22.536 --> 01:44:24.995
...gives me the ring
as a fucking make-up gift.

01:44:25.005 --> 01:44:28.131
-Turns out he stole the shit.
-I wanna know where he is.

01:44:28.141 --> 01:44:30.521
Can you tell me where he is?

01:44:31.912 --> 01:44:33.336
-l--
-No. No.

01:44:33.346 --> 01:44:35.972
-I need an address. Phone number, anything.
-No.

01:44:35.982 --> 01:44:38.177
-Tell me where he is!
-No!

01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:42.315
I saw what they did to you.

01:44:43.356 --> 01:44:45.821
That shit can't happen to me.

01:44:48.128 --> 01:44:51.354
The call lasted
three minutes and 46 seconds.

01:44:51.364 --> 01:44:53.855
From 12:26 to 12:30...

01:44:54.034 --> 01:44:59.062
...from 917-157-1431 to your cell phone.

01:44:59.673 --> 01:45:02.138
Vicinity of Roosevelt Island.

01:45:03.043 --> 01:45:06.136
Did she tell you she was someplace else?

01:45:06.146 --> 01:45:09.047
-Yes, she did.
-I'm sorry, man.

01:45:09.216 --> 01:45:11.212
But fuck her, right?

01:45:11.222 --> 01:45:13.652
-Fuck her.
-Yup.

01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:15.645
Fuck her.

01:45:15.655 --> 01:45:17.782
Hey, do me a favor.

01:45:18.625 --> 01:45:21.017
Keep this to yourself until...

01:45:21.027 --> 01:45:26.297
-...I can get that subpoena.
-Didn't even go on the hard drive.

01:45:47.854 --> 01:45:49.854
Action!

01:45:51.358 --> 01:45:53.908
Think you're fucking with me?!

01:46:04.271 --> 01:46:09.796
Popped your motherfucking cherry!
Over there. Let's even shit out.

01:46:13.413 --> 01:46:15.138
Heads up!

01:46:15.148 --> 01:46:17.148
Hollywood!

01:46:19.619 --> 01:46:22.611
How cute. Lovebirds.

01:47:03.229 --> 01:47:05.229
Action!

01:47:06.733 --> 01:47:09.283
Think you're fucking with me?!

01:48:22.609 --> 01:48:26.519
-You guys wanna make money or not?
-Hell, yeah.

01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:30.240
You know what to do. Stand on that corner
and keep an eye out.

01:48:30.250 --> 01:48:32.509
Show me you can do this.
Show me you're ready.

01:48:32.519 --> 01:48:36.312
Stand next to the four guys,
keep your mouth shut and your eyes open.

01:48:36.322 --> 01:48:37.914
Cops come, what do you do?

01:48:37.924 --> 01:48:39.924
-Run!
-Run, right?

01:49:18.965 --> 01:49:22.358
Good. Listen, motherfuckers,
stand on that sidewalk, keep an eye open.

01:49:22.368 --> 01:49:24.961
-How hard can that shit be? Right?
-Yeah.

01:49:24.971 --> 01:49:29.816
Good. So get going. Get on
that fucking sidewalk. Come on.

01:49:39.786 --> 01:49:41.744
You want something?

01:49:41.754 --> 01:49:43.754
I want my dog back.

01:49:46.326 --> 01:49:48.218
The fuck?

01:49:48.228 --> 01:49:50.696
Hi. Hi, boy. It's me.

01:49:51.231 --> 01:49:53.927
Hey. Hey, buddy. Hey.

01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:56.426
Do you remember me? Huh, boy?

01:49:56.436 --> 01:49:58.436
Come on, man.

01:49:59.973 --> 01:50:01.531
Go, go!

01:50:01.541 --> 01:50:05.535
No, you got me fucking waiting,
and I need an address!

01:50:05.545 --> 01:50:08.775
For Reed Bryant. He came in yesterday.

01:50:35.275 --> 01:50:36.933
Get away, bitch!

01:50:36.943 --> 01:50:38.943
Who's the bitch now?

01:50:44.751 --> 01:50:47.345
-90 Clayton Avenue.
-Thank you.

01:51:18.885 --> 01:51:21.350
Get the fuck out of the road!

01:51:56.522 --> 01:52:00.602
-Hey, puppy.
-Don't you know there's a leash law?

01:52:02.161 --> 01:52:04.425
For a bitch like you!

01:52:05.531 --> 01:52:08.324
It's just you and me
and the fucking dog again, bitch!

01:52:08.334 --> 01:52:11.794
I made your boyfriend smile.
I'm gonna make you smile too, bitch!

01:52:11.804 --> 01:52:15.064
-You think you can come after me, huh?
-Get on the ground!

01:52:15.074 --> 01:52:19.135
Get on the fucking ground! Police!
On the ground! Lay flat on the ground!

01:52:19.145 --> 01:52:21.371
-Drop the gun, Erica!
-Stay out of this!

01:52:21.381 --> 01:52:23.273
-No.
-This is between him and me!

01:52:23.283 --> 01:52:25.942
-You do not have the right.
-Yes, I do!

01:52:25.952 --> 01:52:28.811
No. I have the right
to hunt him down and to shoot him.

01:52:28.821 --> 01:52:30.013
Then shoot him, then!

01:52:30.023 --> 01:52:32.982
I don't do that shit, I investigate it.
Now give me the gun.

01:52:32.992 --> 01:52:36.319
-And what are you gonna do, Mercer?
-Come on.

01:52:36.329 --> 01:52:38.321
-You gonna arrest him?
-Give me the gun.

01:52:38.331 --> 01:52:40.056
-Arrest me, officer!
-Shut up!

01:52:40.066 --> 01:52:41.858
-Give me the gun!
-Come on, cuff me!

01:52:41.868 --> 01:52:44.758
-Shut up!
-Give me the gun, I said.

01:52:45.638 --> 01:52:47.833
Come on. Good girl.

01:52:48.374 --> 01:52:50.467
That's it. Good girl.

01:52:52.412 --> 01:52:54.412
No.

01:53:01.587 --> 01:53:06.490
Now, if you're gonna use a gun,
you make sure it's legal.

01:53:06.659 --> 01:53:08.718
What the fuck are you doing, man?

01:53:08.728 --> 01:53:10.720
-Ain't nobody talking to you.
-Come on--

01:53:10.730 --> 01:53:13.356
-I saw that shit you did!
-You're a fucking cop!

01:53:13.366 --> 01:53:14.590
-Not tonight.
-Come on!

01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:19.275
-Put me in cuffs! Get me out of here!
-Shut the fuck up!

01:53:39.192 --> 01:53:41.192
You can take me now.

01:53:43.229 --> 01:53:46.926
Problem is, if you go down,
I go down.

01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:50.968
No. I can't let you do that for me.

01:54:02.115 --> 01:54:05.430
So you've got one person left to shoot.

01:54:06.686 --> 01:54:08.311
What?

01:54:08.321 --> 01:54:11.984
You see, there was never any vigilante.

01:54:12.158 --> 01:54:16.068
It was just three punks
out on a killing spree.

01:54:17.530 --> 01:54:21.185
They got a taste for it up in Central Park.

01:54:22.268 --> 01:54:25.073
And they bought themselves a gun.

01:54:27.106 --> 01:54:31.543
And they turned on each other,
the way they do.

01:54:31.711 --> 01:54:33.711
And somehow...

01:54:33.846 --> 01:54:36.007
...I got winged and...

01:54:36.983 --> 01:54:39.193
...I did what I had to do.

01:54:41.220 --> 01:54:43.220
Right here.

01:54:46.325 --> 01:54:49.385
-I can't.
-You only shoot bad guys?

01:54:50.229 --> 01:54:55.839
I've joined that club. Now you nick me,
graze me, but you wound me.

01:54:59.172 --> 01:55:01.172
From about 3 feet.

01:55:08.381 --> 01:55:13.481
-My hands are shaking.
-You just make sure you miss my heart.

01:55:20.493 --> 01:55:23.553
Damn! Motherfuck, that shit hurts!

01:55:23.729 --> 01:55:25.729
I'm sorry.

01:55:26.098 --> 01:55:28.098
I'm sorry.

01:55:28.267 --> 01:55:30.159
So am l.

01:55:30.169 --> 01:55:34.164
Now you get out of here
before I lose my temper.

01:56:26.659 --> 01:56:30.059
Baby, look at you.
She left you too, huh?

01:56:30.530 --> 01:56:34.490
That's okay. I got you now.
You're gonna be fine. Come here.

01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:36.880
Come here. Wait, wait, wait!

01:56:50.216 --> 01:56:53.777
10-13, 10-13. Officer hit.

01:56:53.953 --> 01:56:57.821
Three perps down at 90 Clayton.

01:56:59.325 --> 01:57:01.325
Send a bus.

01:57:45.371 --> 01:57:50.365
There is no going back
to that other person...

01:57:51.210 --> 01:57:53.269
...that other place.

01:57:53.646 --> 01:57:57.912
This thing, this stranger...

01:57:58.818 --> 01:58:01.719
...she is all you are now.

02:02:12.805 --> 02:02:15.440
