WEBVTT

00:07.087 --> 00:09.255
How great that we both
exercise in the mornings.

00:09.257 --> 00:10.890
I mean, we can spend time together

00:10.892 --> 00:12.509
and get our workouts in.

00:12.511 --> 00:15.395
I know. Today my boot camp,
tomorrow your beach run...

00:15.397 --> 00:17.263
or is it more like a leisurely stroll?

00:17.265 --> 00:19.766
Hey, there's nothing leisurely
about the way I stroll.

00:19.768 --> 00:21.317
I mean, that's...

00:21.319 --> 00:23.236
If you say "that's just the
way I stroll" I will hit you.

00:23.238 --> 00:24.737
- I wasn't going to.
- Yeah, you were.

00:24.739 --> 00:26.573
I just hope you can keep up with me.

00:26.575 --> 00:28.992
Oh, did I forget to mention
I hold the record

00:28.994 --> 00:31.578
for the 100-yard dash
at my high school in Providence?

00:31.580 --> 00:33.162
Oh, so you're already a pro?

00:33.164 --> 00:34.948
Then you won't need the gift I got you.

00:34.950 --> 00:36.566
You got me a gift?

00:36.568 --> 00:37.784
I always run...

00:37.786 --> 00:40.286
with a pedometer.

00:40.288 --> 00:41.621
You're gonna spoil me.

00:41.623 --> 00:43.706
Wait and see where I'm taking
you for dinner tonight.

00:43.708 --> 00:46.926
Oh, I have a meeting
with a referring doctor tonight.

00:46.928 --> 00:48.928
- Tomorrow?
- I'm on call.

00:48.930 --> 00:50.413
Oh, wait. So am I.

00:50.415 --> 00:53.933
Typical workaholic doctor.

00:53.935 --> 00:55.585
We can figure this out.

00:55.587 --> 00:57.804
What's the rest of the week like?

00:57.806 --> 00:59.255
Uh, the night after tomorrow,

00:59.257 --> 01:01.307
I'm supposed to see my dad
for dinner, but I could cancel.

01:01.309 --> 01:03.393
No. Family dinners are sacrosanct.

01:03.395 --> 01:05.111
And then the night after that,
I'm on call again.

01:05.113 --> 01:06.980
- Can I have my pedometer back?
- No.

01:06.982 --> 01:09.098
Look, either we have a relationship

01:09.100 --> 01:10.783
based solely on workout routines,

01:10.785 --> 01:12.986
or we make on-call nights work.

01:12.988 --> 01:14.120
Yeah.

01:14.122 --> 01:16.072
You know that diner on Clearview?

01:16.074 --> 01:17.490
Isn't the food supposed to be terrible?

01:17.492 --> 01:19.442
Oh, so much worse than terrible.

01:19.444 --> 01:21.777
But next door is my favorite bookstore.

01:21.779 --> 01:22.945
So, if one of us gets called away,

01:22.947 --> 01:24.414
the other can find something good to read.

01:24.416 --> 01:25.748
Oh.

01:25.750 --> 01:27.333
They have an amazing poetry section.

01:27.335 --> 01:29.218
Finally something we don't have in common.

01:29.220 --> 01:30.670
I'm a mystery-novel guy.

01:30.672 --> 01:32.589
Oh, I bet they have those there too.

01:32.591 --> 01:35.291
Then the terrible diner it is.

01:35.293 --> 01:37.760
You guys look tired, huh?
Didn't have your breakfast?

01:41.132 --> 01:43.799
Oh...

01:43.801 --> 01:45.985
How sweet.

01:45.987 --> 01:47.937
Do it on your own time!

01:47.939 --> 01:49.822
This is my time!

01:49.824 --> 01:51.524
- Okay.
- Get on line!

01:51.526 --> 01:53.326
You're loud.

01:53.328 --> 01:55.495
Synchronize! Come on!

01:55.497 --> 01:58.648
- Come on, guys.
- Got it.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:10.377 --> 02:11.994
What are you doing?

02:11.996 --> 02:15.715
If I'm gonna stay here,
I need to pull my weight.

02:15.717 --> 02:17.967
I mean, I know Hank is understanding,

02:17.969 --> 02:19.969
but he certainly
did not expect your fiancee

02:19.971 --> 02:23.222
to start working here and move in.

02:23.224 --> 02:25.642
You... you did tell him that
classes start soon, right?

02:25.644 --> 02:26.859
That this is just temporary?

02:26.861 --> 02:28.645
Okay, "A," you don't have to do this.

02:28.647 --> 02:31.898
"B," how dirty do you think we are?

02:31.900 --> 02:34.350
- I'm doing it again.
- You're doing it again.

02:34.352 --> 02:36.319
Yeah.

02:36.321 --> 02:39.188
I am filling my time caretaking

02:39.190 --> 02:41.908
instead of facing the thing
I should be facing.

02:41.910 --> 02:43.459
Yeah.

02:43.461 --> 02:45.578
So how about instead of doing that,

02:45.580 --> 02:49.165
for five minutes, you come with me...

02:49.167 --> 02:52.168
you sit down...

02:52.170 --> 02:53.970
and you talk to me about it?

02:53.972 --> 02:56.472
What am I supposed to say...

02:56.474 --> 02:58.508
that I was lied to my whole life,

02:58.510 --> 03:01.227
that I can't even bear
the thought of going home

03:01.229 --> 03:03.646
because it doesn't even feel
like home anymore?

03:03.648 --> 03:06.432
When's the last time you spoke
to your parents?

03:06.434 --> 03:08.601
- You mean the Collins?
- Paige.

03:08.603 --> 03:10.987
I'm sorry, that was...

03:10.989 --> 03:13.222
that was mean.

03:13.224 --> 03:14.657
All right.

03:14.659 --> 03:16.559
Tell me what I can do to help.

03:16.561 --> 03:19.729
Anything... what can I do?

03:19.731 --> 03:23.416
Just give me some time.

03:23.418 --> 03:24.584
Time?

03:24.586 --> 03:26.536
- Okay.
- Thank you.

03:26.538 --> 03:29.238
Yeah.

03:29.240 --> 03:32.041
All the time you need.

03:32.043 --> 03:33.459
Hello?

03:33.461 --> 03:37.130
Oh, gosh, I hate to interrupt
a moment of passion,

03:37.132 --> 03:39.465
- but, um, we need a doctor.
- Um, mom...

03:39.467 --> 03:42.051
This doesn't look like a doctor's office.

03:42.053 --> 03:43.186
No, uh, it is.

03:43.188 --> 03:44.920
It's a concierge doctor's office.

03:44.922 --> 03:46.606
We usually come to you.

03:46.608 --> 03:48.274
I wondered how you ran a business

03:48.276 --> 03:50.610
with those guards all over the place.

03:50.612 --> 03:52.195
Ah, yes.

03:52.197 --> 03:54.313
The article in Dan's paper
said nothing about them.

03:54.315 --> 03:57.900
But it did say that you were
located close to our home.

03:57.902 --> 03:59.452
You didn't make an appointment?

03:59.454 --> 04:01.871
The article said they were available 24-7.

04:01.873 --> 04:04.240
- Hi. I'm Jackie.
- Hi.

04:04.242 --> 04:06.793
And this is my daughter Fiona.

04:06.795 --> 04:08.161
Hi, Evan R. Lawson, CFO.

04:08.163 --> 04:09.996
This is Paige, our office manager.

04:09.998 --> 04:12.665
Hi. The doctor should be back very soon.

04:12.667 --> 04:14.000
Please, make yourselves comfortable.

04:14.002 --> 04:16.753
No, no. We should make an appointment.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.589
I'm sorry. My mom...
she doesn't do schedules,

04:19.591 --> 04:21.339
but I'm sure that a medical practice does.

04:21.341 --> 04:23.593
No, we... we make a lot
of exceptions, actually.

04:23.595 --> 04:24.977
I can't wait here now, all right?

04:24.979 --> 04:26.395
I'm gonna be late for summer school.

04:26.397 --> 04:29.315
Fiona, Fiona, you have
a dreadful stomachache.

04:29.317 --> 04:30.966
I think you can miss class for that,

04:30.968 --> 04:33.269
especially since the class
is probably causing it.

04:33.271 --> 04:36.489
No, dreadful is not an emergency, okay?

04:36.491 --> 04:39.108
We're gonna come back w...

04:39.110 --> 04:40.493
Okay.

04:40.495 --> 04:41.828
Do you have a restroom?

04:41.830 --> 04:44.614
Yeah, right down there to the left.

04:44.616 --> 04:46.666
So sorry.

05:08.222 --> 05:10.506
Were you watching me sleep?

05:10.508 --> 05:12.191
Maybe.

05:15.897 --> 05:19.532
Let's call in sick,
spend the day in bed together.

05:19.534 --> 05:21.400
Very tempting...

05:21.402 --> 05:22.952
Come on.

05:22.954 --> 05:24.654
We have so few days left.

05:24.656 --> 05:26.489
What do you mean?

05:26.491 --> 05:30.209
Well, I'm leaving soon for Oahu.

05:31.879 --> 05:33.329
You are?

05:33.331 --> 05:36.415
I have to get back on the road
with the polo team.

05:36.417 --> 05:38.084
Of course.

05:38.086 --> 05:41.204
- When?
- Five days.

05:43.974 --> 05:45.591
So we should spend

05:45.593 --> 05:49.228
as much of this time together as possible.

05:49.230 --> 05:51.180
Keep out the real world...

05:51.182 --> 05:54.600
for as long as we can.

05:54.602 --> 05:55.985
I can't.

05:55.987 --> 05:58.738
I, uh, have to work.

05:58.740 --> 06:03.058
And I promised Hank that
I would meet him this morning.

06:03.060 --> 06:05.862
I... I can't be late.

06:05.864 --> 06:10.065
I suppose I should go to practice.

06:12.903 --> 06:15.404
I'll see you tonight?

06:15.406 --> 06:17.373
Yeah, of course... tonight.

06:55.823 --> 07:00.823
Royal Pains 4x12 - Hurts Like A Mother
Original air date September 5, 2012

07:00.848 --> 07:05.848
Sync and corrections by atrn97g
for www.addic7ed.com

07:08.001 --> 07:10.569
She leaves for college in the fall,

07:10.571 --> 07:13.873
but she insisted on taking
this A.P. class now

07:13.875 --> 07:16.259
that she could just as easily take then.

07:16.261 --> 07:20.630
If it were me, I would spend
my last summer lying by the pool

07:20.632 --> 07:23.082
drinking virgin margaritas.

07:23.084 --> 07:24.250
Yeah.

07:24.252 --> 07:27.053
Because that is how you prepare for M.I.T.

07:27.055 --> 07:29.222
Here, water.

07:29.224 --> 07:32.775
So I don't see any stones
in your gallbladder or duct.

07:32.777 --> 07:34.110
I'll check your appendix now.

07:34.112 --> 07:37.813
Maybe if you did yoga
or meditated with me,

07:37.815 --> 07:40.149
then this class
wouldn't drive you so crazy.

07:40.151 --> 07:44.270
Mom, I told you, I like organic chemistry.

07:44.272 --> 07:46.956
I have no idea where this side
of my daughter came from.

07:46.958 --> 07:51.711
Me, my husband, and my son
wouldn't know organic chemistry

07:51.713 --> 07:52.912
from organic produce.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.465
Okay, so there's no evidence
of appendicitis either.

07:56.467 --> 07:58.384
Well, I felt nauseous last week too.

07:58.386 --> 08:01.420
That doesn't mean there's
anything serious to worry about.

08:01.422 --> 08:03.172
I'll give you some antiemetics
to treat the nausea,

08:03.174 --> 08:05.308
and I'll run some tests
on your blood and urine.

08:05.310 --> 08:08.127
I, uh... I don't need a pregnancy test.

08:08.129 --> 08:10.479
Yep, I'm probably the only
mother in the Hamptons

08:10.481 --> 08:12.848
who wishes her daughter
made time for boys.

08:12.850 --> 08:14.267
She doesn't understand me

08:14.269 --> 08:16.936
because I'm not ripping off my bodice.

08:16.938 --> 08:18.654
I'm a romance novelist...

08:18.656 --> 08:21.324
well, a part-time romance novelist.

08:21.326 --> 08:22.575
I just write when I can,

08:22.577 --> 08:27.146
and I leave myself time
to rest and replenish.

08:27.148 --> 08:30.116
I won't get my characters
out of bed without good reason.

08:30.118 --> 08:32.585
Anything I may have read?

08:32.587 --> 08:34.370
Well, my biggest hit was my first one...

08:34.371 --> 08:36.172
<i>The Other Side Of Ecstasy.</i>

08:36.174 --> 08:38.174
It's exactly what it sounds like.

08:38.176 --> 08:40.159
Hold on. You're Jackie Van Ark?

08:40.160 --> 08:42.428
- Uh-huh.
- I love that book!

08:42.429 --> 08:44.880
That's... we used to read it out loud

08:44.882 --> 08:47.516
- at summer camp after lights out.
- All right.

08:47.518 --> 08:50.553
I, uh... I haven't... I'm probably
not your target audience.

08:50.555 --> 08:53.806
Oh, anyone who makes love
is my target audience.

08:53.808 --> 08:55.441
- Really?
- I'll send you a copy.

08:55.443 --> 08:57.143
Okay.

08:57.145 --> 08:59.395
- This may hurt a little.
- Oh, she hates shots...

08:59.397 --> 09:00.980
ever since she was little.

09:00.982 --> 09:04.483
Uh, so, hey, are you going
to live in the dorms at M.I.T.?

09:04.485 --> 09:06.369
'Cause I'm about to start at Parsons,

09:06.371 --> 09:07.787
and I found this blog

09:07.789 --> 09:09.989
that shows you
how to arrange your furniture

09:09.991 --> 09:12.291
to make 200 square feet feel like 500.

09:12.293 --> 09:15.828
It's... it's awesome.

09:15.830 --> 09:17.330
- Okay.
- Yeah.

09:17.332 --> 09:19.548
All done.

09:19.550 --> 09:20.716
Thank you.

09:20.718 --> 09:23.002
Hey.

09:23.004 --> 09:24.637
Hey. I am so sorry I am late.

09:24.639 --> 09:26.339
I had the craziest of nights.

09:26.341 --> 09:27.840
Don't worry about it.
Jeremiah needs a ride.

09:27.842 --> 09:29.842
Can you pick him up on the way
to your first appointment?

09:29.844 --> 09:31.543
- Sure.
- Great.

09:31.545 --> 09:34.814
So I couldn't find one of my shoes.

09:34.816 --> 09:37.283
And when I got to my car,
it was practically out of gas.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.934
You don't have to explain.
You're five minutes late.

09:38.936 --> 09:40.219
Hey, is everything okay?

09:40.221 --> 09:42.655
You seem unusually anxious.

09:42.657 --> 09:43.889
Do I?

09:43.891 --> 09:45.858
Yeah, and, honestly,
for the last few days,

09:45.860 --> 09:48.494
you've seemed unusually giddy.

09:48.496 --> 09:51.864
- I've met someone.
- That's great.

09:51.866 --> 09:52.865
Who is he?

09:52.867 --> 09:56.085
Actually, you know him.

09:56.087 --> 09:57.503
Rafa.

09:57.505 --> 09:59.372
Rafa?

09:59.374 --> 10:01.874
H... he seems like a decent guy...
great polo player.

10:01.876 --> 10:03.376
- Is he still here?
- Yes.

10:03.378 --> 10:04.677
But he's leaving soon.

10:04.679 --> 10:06.962
Oh, but you'll keep seeing each other?

10:06.964 --> 10:08.914
Well, I hope so.

10:08.916 --> 10:10.716
We... we haven't talked about it,

10:10.718 --> 10:12.718
b... but we've talked
about all sorts of other things.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.553
He has amazing stories

10:14.555 --> 10:16.605
from being all over the world,

10:16.607 --> 10:18.891
and... and he wants to hear my stories too.

10:18.893 --> 10:21.777
We holed up in his hotel room.

10:23.530 --> 10:26.432
That was nearly too much information.

10:26.434 --> 10:28.100
I love seeing you happy.

10:28.102 --> 10:30.619
Happy? Yes.

10:30.621 --> 10:32.405
Maybe a little crazy too.

10:32.407 --> 10:34.790
No, listen, I just hope
he's worthy of you.

10:34.792 --> 10:36.625
Hey, maybe you should bring
him around some time.

10:36.627 --> 10:39.161
Oh, Hank, how very big brother of you.

10:39.163 --> 10:40.629
Yeah, it'll be fun.

10:40.631 --> 10:43.749
We'll get to know him
man-to-man and man-to-Evan.

10:43.751 --> 10:46.118
You know, I'd like that.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.970
We could have a dinner party.

10:47.972 --> 10:50.973
Then everybody
could get to know one another.

10:50.975 --> 10:52.641
It has to be something special,
something big.

10:52.643 --> 10:54.093
That's not exactly what I meant.

10:54.095 --> 10:56.011
Hank...

10:57.398 --> 10:59.465
I've never felt like this before.

10:59.467 --> 11:02.735
When he calls,
I get butterflies in my stomach.

11:02.737 --> 11:06.739
When he leaves the room,
even for a moment, I miss him.

11:08.525 --> 11:11.310
I just hope he feels the same way.

11:11.312 --> 11:13.779
Okay. Something special it is.

11:13.781 --> 11:16.332
Great! You guys are going to love him.

11:16.334 --> 11:18.117
Divya?

11:18.119 --> 11:19.368
I am fine.

11:19.370 --> 11:21.087
Thank you for the idea.

11:21.089 --> 11:23.339
Yeah.

11:28.161 --> 11:31.180
Thank you for picking me up.
My car's being detailed.

11:31.182 --> 11:33.015
Your car is always spotless.

11:33.017 --> 11:34.717
Exactly.

11:34.719 --> 11:37.770
Jeremiah, your home is beautiful.

11:37.772 --> 11:41.023
It's built for entertaining.

11:41.025 --> 11:42.691
Yes, my mentor designed it that way.

11:42.693 --> 11:46.529
He had many dinner parties here.

11:46.531 --> 11:47.947
You ready?

11:47.949 --> 11:49.832
I need you to leave first in
order for me to set the alarm.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.150
Oh.

11:59.025 --> 12:01.827
So you never entertain, Jeremiah?

12:01.829 --> 12:04.029
I've never had a reason.

12:04.031 --> 12:05.164
Would you like one?

12:05.166 --> 12:06.999
I'm planning a dinner party,

12:07.001 --> 12:09.201
and I want it to be very special.

12:09.203 --> 12:11.837
And your house is definitely that.

12:11.839 --> 12:14.557
Oh, you're welcome to host it
here anytime you want.

12:14.559 --> 12:15.724
Tomorrow?

12:15.726 --> 12:17.709
Tomorrow. Sure.

12:19.646 --> 12:22.381
May I ask... are you celebrating something?

12:22.383 --> 12:24.383
Yes.

12:24.385 --> 12:26.218
I, uh...

12:26.220 --> 12:29.388
I want to introduce everyone
to my new boyfriend.

12:45.789 --> 12:48.240
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:52.462 --> 12:54.780
Can you take a break from
the housewife porn for one sec?

12:54.782 --> 12:56.382
Jackie sent it... I'm just
reading it to be polite.

12:56.384 --> 12:58.350
Look, I don't care what kind
of weird stuff you're into,

12:58.352 --> 13:00.019
I just need your advice.

13:00.021 --> 13:01.587
Henry, for one sec, please.

13:01.589 --> 13:04.223
- Come on.
- God.

13:04.225 --> 13:05.757
What?

13:05.759 --> 13:07.560
All right, so I've been reading

13:07.562 --> 13:10.029
these adoption support websites.

13:10.031 --> 13:12.147
Good for you. You're informing yourself.

13:12.149 --> 13:16.819
Yeah, but it's... it's... it's not enough.

13:16.821 --> 13:18.704
Paige says she needs time.

13:18.706 --> 13:21.707
- What I think she needs...
- Is time.

13:21.709 --> 13:23.876
No, she'll be happier
if she's doing something...

13:23.878 --> 13:25.160
other than cleaning.

13:25.162 --> 13:26.662
- Why?
- Because...

13:26.664 --> 13:28.998
isn't everyone happier
when they're doing something?

13:29.000 --> 13:30.749
I think you mean you'd feel better

13:30.751 --> 13:33.469
if you were doing something.

13:36.224 --> 13:39.225
She just seems so lost.

13:41.144 --> 13:42.294
I want to help her.

13:42.296 --> 13:44.263
I have no idea how.

13:44.265 --> 13:45.814
There are no...

13:45.816 --> 13:47.399
pep talks for this.

13:47.401 --> 13:50.469
There are no sweet fiancee things
I can do to fix it for her.

13:50.471 --> 13:53.472
You can't fix it.

13:53.474 --> 13:56.358
But you can be there.

13:56.360 --> 13:57.693
That's plenty.

13:57.695 --> 13:59.995
I could at least, like... what if I...

13:59.997 --> 14:01.997
Evan, I know it's hard, but do nothing.

14:01.999 --> 14:04.783
That's the best way to help her right now.

14:04.785 --> 14:07.503
I promise.

14:07.505 --> 14:09.171
Good talk.

14:09.173 --> 14:10.673
I'll do nothing.

14:10.675 --> 14:13.325
Yeah, that should be easy for me.

14:13.327 --> 14:16.011
Oh, my God.

14:16.013 --> 14:17.996
General.

14:17.998 --> 14:19.998
Evan...

14:20.000 --> 14:22.384
you got to do something.

14:27.918 --> 14:31.554
We made a mistake not telling Paige.

14:31.556 --> 14:33.990
We thought we were doing the right thing.

14:33.992 --> 14:36.792
We discussed it many times,

14:36.794 --> 14:38.627
but we didn't want her to question

14:38.629 --> 14:42.431
that... that she was part of the family.

14:42.433 --> 14:45.935
We wanted Paige to feel secure and loved.

14:45.937 --> 14:47.353
She did.

14:47.355 --> 14:48.821
She... she does.

14:51.174 --> 14:54.944
She has every right to be angry with us.

14:54.946 --> 14:58.814
We kept this secret too long.

14:58.816 --> 15:02.535
I've always been too willing
to keep secrets.

15:04.287 --> 15:08.958
But I honestly believed
I was protecting my family...

15:08.960 --> 15:11.010
the only way I knew how.

15:13.964 --> 15:15.514
You know Paige.

15:15.516 --> 15:18.050
You know she loves you.

15:18.052 --> 15:20.686
She just needs time.

15:23.006 --> 15:25.474
Her mother and I miss her...

15:27.644 --> 15:29.178
so much.

15:31.848 --> 15:35.684
Just tell her that.

15:35.686 --> 15:38.654
She'll listen to you, son.

15:47.464 --> 15:49.915
I was just putting a book away,

15:49.917 --> 15:51.801
and it slipped out of my hand,

15:51.803 --> 15:53.052
and the next thing I know,

15:53.054 --> 15:55.554
I have pulled this whole thing
on top of my foot,

15:55.556 --> 15:58.057
and it swelled up
like a superabsorbent polymer.

15:59.876 --> 16:03.179
They can absorb and retain up
to 500 times their weight and...

16:03.181 --> 16:04.713
Never mind.

16:06.267 --> 16:08.050
So nothing's broken.

16:08.052 --> 16:10.903
Sorry I can't say the same
for the bookshelf.

16:10.905 --> 16:12.438
It's an <i>etagere.</i>

16:12.440 --> 16:15.407
It's built to display
delicate <i>objets d'art.</i>

16:15.409 --> 16:17.193
Ah.

16:17.195 --> 16:20.029
I wanted her to have beautiful
artistic things around her.

16:20.031 --> 16:22.498
And I put my clunky textbooks on it.

16:22.500 --> 16:25.284
I guess the <i>etagere</i> revolted.

16:25.286 --> 16:27.419
Okay, uh, I'll wrap up your foot.

16:27.421 --> 16:29.872
If you could keep your leg up
for me, that'd be great.

16:29.874 --> 16:31.740
If you keep ice on it,
the swelling should go down.

16:31.742 --> 16:34.510
Now, how's your abdominal pain.

16:34.512 --> 16:36.378
Uh, it's gone.

16:36.380 --> 16:39.081
Paige didn't come with you?

16:39.083 --> 16:40.216
I wanted to thank her.

16:40.218 --> 16:42.017
She texted me a link to that blog.

16:42.019 --> 16:45.054
Oh, Paige doesn't usually come
with me on house calls,

16:45.056 --> 16:47.139
but I'll bet she'll be happy
to get a text from you.

16:47.141 --> 16:49.642
How about your nausea?

16:49.644 --> 16:51.760
Um, the shot worked.

16:51.762 --> 16:53.279
Thanks.

16:53.281 --> 16:55.564
Tough to concentrate
when you're throwing up all day.

16:55.566 --> 16:57.566
You're welcome, but according
to your blood work,

16:57.568 --> 16:59.201
the vomiting left you dehydrated.

16:59.203 --> 17:02.872
So, not surprisingly,
you need to rehydrate and rest.

17:02.874 --> 17:06.275
Well, sure, right after
my organic chem final.

17:06.277 --> 17:08.210
Fiona, it can't wait that long.

17:08.212 --> 17:10.612
You need a break.

17:17.287 --> 17:19.722
That was his favorite shade of white.

17:19.723 --> 17:22.124
You have a lovely home.

17:22.126 --> 17:24.059
Oh, I don't rent it out or anything.

17:24.060 --> 17:25.794
It's just a one-time thing.

17:25.796 --> 17:29.481
Oh, uh, is there gonna be
a fish option without eyes?

17:30.968 --> 17:33.068
Thanks for being flexible
about the dinner plans.

17:33.070 --> 17:35.571
I know there's no bookstore
if I get called away.

17:35.573 --> 17:37.439
- I'll entertain myself.
- Good.

17:37.441 --> 17:40.409
- Wow. This is so swanky.
- I know.

17:40.411 --> 17:42.244
If this is just to introduce Rafa,

17:42.246 --> 17:44.146
I can't wait to see
what she does for his birthday.

17:44.148 --> 17:47.366
He has to show up
for his introduction first.

17:47.368 --> 17:48.784
Well, give it to Divya.

17:48.786 --> 17:50.619
She sure goes all out to make a statement.

17:50.621 --> 17:52.154
Not usually, right, Ev?

17:52.156 --> 17:53.339
Yeah, it's pretty un-ivya.

17:53.341 --> 17:56.158
- She's usually so...
- Uptight?

17:56.160 --> 17:59.962
- I was gonna say "reserved."
- Yeah, me too.

17:59.964 --> 18:00.963
Oh, hi.

18:00.965 --> 18:03.599
- You made it.
- Of course.

18:03.601 --> 18:05.968
Wow. This is quite a spread.

18:05.970 --> 18:08.170
Did Rafa win a tournament or something?

18:08.172 --> 18:09.671
No, Divya's just lost her mind.

18:09.673 --> 18:12.007
- How are you? You good?
- I'm great.

18:12.009 --> 18:14.860
You look great. You seem, like, happy.

18:14.862 --> 18:16.028
Yeah.

18:16.030 --> 18:17.863
I hung out with Fiona this afternoon.

18:17.865 --> 18:20.015
- The vomiting girl?
- Mm-hmm.

18:20.017 --> 18:22.368
She texted, and I stopped by.

18:22.370 --> 18:25.154
Bonding with a patient...
that's very Hankmed of you.

18:25.156 --> 18:26.822
I know.

18:26.824 --> 18:31.360
It started because she seems
kind of disconnected

18:31.362 --> 18:33.078
from her family.

18:33.080 --> 18:35.047
Which makes her kind of
relatable to you right now?

18:35.049 --> 18:36.632
Yeah.

18:36.634 --> 18:38.801
But hearing how positive

18:38.803 --> 18:41.804
and... and focused she is about school,

18:41.806 --> 18:42.805
I admire her.

18:42.807 --> 18:44.873
She's moving forward,

18:44.875 --> 18:46.926
and I want to do the same.

18:46.928 --> 18:48.811
So no more adoption talk, okay?

18:48.813 --> 18:50.312
- It's a plan.
- Good.

18:50.314 --> 18:53.082
I don't know how this is gonna
fit into that plan, but, um...

18:53.084 --> 18:54.233
your dad came to see me.

18:54.235 --> 18:56.068
He did?

18:56.070 --> 18:57.319
What happened?

18:57.321 --> 18:59.021
You told me you needed time,

18:59.023 --> 19:01.723
so I... I just told him that.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.909
Thank you.

19:03.911 --> 19:05.527
How is he?

19:05.529 --> 19:09.415
I mean, you know how desperate
he had to be to come see me.

19:09.417 --> 19:11.750
They miss you.

19:16.906 --> 19:20.175
He's here. He's here.

19:20.177 --> 19:21.677
He's here.

19:21.679 --> 19:24.263
- You're here.
- Yes, of course.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.516
Um, I'm sorry I'm late,

19:27.518 --> 19:29.268
but it's hard for a man from Buenos Aires

19:29.270 --> 19:32.421
to take a 7:00
dinner invitation seriously.

19:32.423 --> 19:35.441
For the beautiful hostess.

19:40.563 --> 19:42.614
I love it.

19:42.616 --> 19:45.317
- What... what is it?
- It's for drinking <i>mate.</i>

19:45.319 --> 19:49.488
In Argentina, it's a tradition
to drink from the same cup.

19:49.490 --> 19:50.789
This one will be ours to share.

19:50.791 --> 19:54.660
Look, it's engraved. You see?

19:54.662 --> 19:56.712
- <i>Mi preciosa.</i>
- <i>Si.</i>

19:56.714 --> 19:58.280
So romantic.

19:58.282 --> 20:00.949
But can it tell how far she runs?

20:00.951 --> 20:03.002
I love it.

20:03.004 --> 20:04.803
Thank you.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.676
Um, um...

20:10.678 --> 20:13.145
okay, all right, everyone...

20:13.147 --> 20:14.646
this is Rafa.

20:14.648 --> 20:17.266
Rafa, this is everyone.

20:17.268 --> 20:20.135
- <i>Mucho gusto.</i>
- <i>Good to see you again.</i>

20:20.137 --> 20:22.654
- Shall we eat?
- Yeah.

20:25.825 --> 20:29.078
So can this behavior
be explained medically,

20:29.080 --> 20:31.830
or should we actually worry
about body snatchers?

20:31.832 --> 20:34.483
She fell so hard so fast.

20:34.485 --> 20:36.985
She's acting like a teenager. What the...?

20:36.987 --> 20:39.154
We should do something.

20:39.156 --> 20:40.339
I already talked to her.

20:40.341 --> 20:41.840
I mean, I don't know what else we can do.

20:41.842 --> 20:43.592
Again with the "do nothing"?

20:43.594 --> 20:44.826
Well...

20:44.828 --> 20:47.463
Hey, that was mine.

20:47.465 --> 20:50.432
I'll make another one.

20:53.770 --> 20:56.939
- May I have a word?
- Why?

20:56.941 --> 20:59.475
I don't want to alarm Divya,

20:59.477 --> 21:00.692
and I didn't approach Hank

21:00.694 --> 21:03.178
because I know how close they are,

21:03.180 --> 21:04.480
but I believe I need a doctor.

21:04.482 --> 21:07.483
What's wrong?

21:07.485 --> 21:10.702
My fingers and wrist are numb.

21:10.704 --> 21:13.989
And sometimes I can't move it at all.

21:13.991 --> 21:17.126
This is not good for polo,
among other things.

21:17.128 --> 21:19.545
I can see you tomorrow for an X-ray.

21:19.547 --> 21:22.030
Okay, thank you.

21:22.032 --> 21:24.500
I took an oath.

21:32.009 --> 21:34.843
Hank, it's Fiona.

21:36.546 --> 21:39.098
I wish she told me
she was feeling sick again.

21:39.100 --> 21:41.266
I'm her mother.
I mean, I want to help her.

21:41.268 --> 21:42.734
Of course.

21:42.736 --> 21:45.387
Fiona? What's the matter?

21:45.389 --> 21:48.223
I'm drinking plenty of fluids,
like you said,

21:48.225 --> 21:50.559
but my nausea's back,

21:50.561 --> 21:52.995
and my stomach really, really hurts.

21:52.997 --> 21:56.665
Okay, let's have a listen.

21:56.667 --> 21:59.251
Your heart is racing.

22:00.703 --> 22:02.421
Weak and thready.

22:02.423 --> 22:07.075
Okay, let me test your skin profusion.

22:07.077 --> 22:08.760
We need to take you to the hospital.

22:08.762 --> 22:10.095
Let's get you up.

22:10.097 --> 22:12.914
- Wait. What's wrong?
- She's dehydrated.

22:12.916 --> 22:15.050
- Whoa.
- Whoa!

22:15.052 --> 22:16.602
- Fiona.
- Call 911.

22:16.604 --> 22:18.971
- Help me raise her feet.
- Okay.

22:18.973 --> 22:20.522
What's happening?

22:20.524 --> 22:22.924
Her dehydration has become
critical. Hold that.

22:22.926 --> 22:24.610
But she was drinking water
the whole time I was here.

22:24.612 --> 22:27.062
I can't explain why, but her
low circulating volume of blood

22:27.064 --> 22:28.430
is sending her into shock.

22:28.432 --> 22:29.598
If we don't resuscitate her now,

22:29.600 --> 22:32.434
she could go into cardiac arrest.

22:39.450 --> 22:41.117
You're gonna be okay.

22:41.119 --> 22:42.819
Fiona's fluids have been replenished.

22:42.821 --> 22:45.088
We caught the hypovolemia in time.

22:45.090 --> 22:48.975
But she's running a fever
and still has an acute abdomen.

22:48.977 --> 22:51.794
The surgeon wants to perform
an emergency appendectomy.

22:51.796 --> 22:54.797
This is the release form.
I can walk you through it.

22:54.799 --> 22:58.068
Well, you said you didn't find
anything on the ultrasound.

22:58.070 --> 22:59.819
Yeah, and her C.T.
just came back negative,

22:59.821 --> 23:02.572
but sometimes scans
don't give the full picture.

23:02.574 --> 23:04.107
They need to remove her appendix

23:04.109 --> 23:05.775
to be sure it's not causing her symptoms.

23:05.777 --> 23:07.410
Look, I know it sounds scary,

23:07.412 --> 23:09.579
but it's the best course
of action we have right now.

23:09.581 --> 23:11.481
I just, um...

23:11.483 --> 23:13.983
I just need her to be all right.

23:13.985 --> 23:16.586
And hopefully she will be.

23:16.588 --> 23:18.755
Why don't you start by filling
in that section right there?

23:18.757 --> 23:22.208
Okay.

23:22.210 --> 23:26.162
Jackie? You have a rash.

23:26.164 --> 23:30.133
Oh, yeah, I get 'em sometimes
when I'm stressed.

23:30.135 --> 23:31.601
Does it itch?

23:31.603 --> 23:34.271
No, it's nothing.
It... it'll go away on its own...

23:34.273 --> 23:36.606
as soon as Fiona's all right, I'm sure.

23:36.608 --> 23:39.643
Okay, they'll send her into
surgery as soon as possible.

23:39.645 --> 23:43.196
But how long will I need to recuperate?

23:43.198 --> 23:44.847
Hank will explain all of that.

23:44.849 --> 23:47.367
But you don't need to worry
about your A.P. class.

23:47.369 --> 23:48.652
I emailed your teacher

23:48.654 --> 23:50.654
an official doctor's note from Hank,

23:50.656 --> 23:52.956
and she's gonna let you take
the final later.

23:52.958 --> 23:56.025
Can you postpone fall semester too?

23:56.027 --> 23:59.296
So you start M.I.T. In the spring.

23:59.298 --> 24:02.999
Fiona, your health is more important.

24:05.837 --> 24:07.470
Oh, you don't understand.

24:07.472 --> 24:12.342
At school, I'm gonna be around
people I can relate to...

24:12.344 --> 24:15.145
Not like my...

24:15.147 --> 24:18.047
family.

24:18.049 --> 24:21.551
I'm just tired of being
the odd girl out all the time.

24:21.553 --> 24:24.321
Yeah, it's...

24:24.323 --> 24:26.740
hard to feel like you don't fit.

24:26.742 --> 24:29.659
I'm like a different species.

24:29.661 --> 24:33.413
Everyone in my family is so creative

24:33.415 --> 24:35.532
and free-spirited.

24:35.534 --> 24:38.368
I took a writing class once.

24:38.370 --> 24:39.919
I had a panic attack,

24:39.921 --> 24:42.088
and I got my first and only "C".

24:42.090 --> 24:46.576
A lot of people have trouble
expressing themselves that way.

24:46.578 --> 24:48.712
Not my mom.

24:48.714 --> 24:51.881
Even when she's not writing,
it doesn't bother her.

24:51.883 --> 24:54.601
She's so mellow.

24:54.603 --> 24:57.920
And I wish I could be more like her.

24:57.922 --> 24:59.472
I'm sorry.

24:59.474 --> 25:01.391
You probably have
more important things to do

25:01.393 --> 25:03.560
than listen to me whine about my family.

25:03.562 --> 25:05.645
You are not whining.

25:05.647 --> 25:09.449
And I think you're
pretty special the way you are.

25:09.451 --> 25:11.701
I bet your family thinks so too.

25:11.703 --> 25:13.787
I know they love you.

25:13.789 --> 25:15.372
I mean, look at your mom.

25:15.374 --> 25:18.575
She's been by your side this whole time.

25:21.111 --> 25:23.997
Yeah. I guess so.

25:25.633 --> 25:27.717
Thanks for listening to me, Paige.

25:27.719 --> 25:29.919
Of course.

25:36.644 --> 25:39.062
Thank you both for coming.

25:39.064 --> 25:41.431
But I'm afraid I have some upsetting news.

25:41.433 --> 25:44.300
Rafa, I'm sorry.
Your tests have come back.

25:44.302 --> 25:46.136
Your paralysis will continue to progress,

25:46.138 --> 25:48.655
and we cannot reverse or even stop it.

25:52.193 --> 25:53.476
Are you sure?

25:53.478 --> 25:55.645
I've run every test twice.

25:57.114 --> 26:00.283
Well, you are a brilliant doctor.

26:02.287 --> 26:05.789
Obviously, you will never play polo again.

26:05.791 --> 26:07.340
But is that really such a tragedy?

26:07.342 --> 26:09.325
Will the world suffer
if you can't ride on your horse

26:09.327 --> 26:10.427
waving your mallet around?

26:16.500 --> 26:19.001
I need a hug.

26:19.003 --> 26:20.303
I can't.

26:20.305 --> 26:22.722
Wait.

26:22.724 --> 26:24.140
There is one thing I could try.

26:26.477 --> 26:28.678
If I introduce a gene
for a transcription factor

26:28.680 --> 26:30.730
normally expressed during
the growth of axons,

26:30.732 --> 26:33.867
I may be able to motivate
the peripheral nervous system

26:33.869 --> 26:36.619
to regenerate as Schwann cells.

26:36.621 --> 26:38.204
You really think that would work?

26:46.580 --> 26:47.714
I'm cured.

26:51.502 --> 26:54.203
You're incredible, Jeremiah.

26:54.205 --> 26:57.590
Your commitment to cutting-edge research

26:57.592 --> 26:59.208
is unparalleled.

27:02.012 --> 27:04.898
Jeremiah.

27:04.900 --> 27:07.350
Jeremiah?

27:09.987 --> 27:12.238
Jeremiah!

27:12.240 --> 27:15.241
- What's going on, man?
- Nothing.

27:15.243 --> 27:16.576
You were staring at that X-ray

27:16.578 --> 27:18.161
for, like, five minutes
straight, not moving,

27:18.163 --> 27:19.779
like you were paralyzed or something.

27:19.781 --> 27:21.281
It's a medical conundrum.

27:21.283 --> 27:23.449
Oh, yeah?

27:23.451 --> 27:24.918
Is Rafa okay?

27:24.920 --> 27:28.588
What makes you think it's Rafa?

27:28.590 --> 27:30.406
Um, it says his name on the X-ray.

27:30.408 --> 27:31.758
Don't worry about it, though...

27:31.760 --> 27:33.126
you know, doctor-patient whatever.

27:33.128 --> 27:36.245
Is he all right, though?
I don't believe so.

27:36.247 --> 27:38.264
He may be suffering
from the nearly always fatal

27:38.266 --> 27:40.683
Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy

27:40.685 --> 27:43.853
or possibly a malignant schwannoma.

27:43.855 --> 27:45.588
What?

27:45.590 --> 27:47.941
- Those sound horrible.
- They are.

27:47.943 --> 27:49.609
The guy looks so perfect.

27:49.611 --> 27:52.094
Well, looks can be deceiving.

27:52.096 --> 27:54.147
So Rafa may be dying?

27:54.149 --> 27:57.567
Uh, act... I've only performed an X-ray.

27:57.569 --> 27:58.768
He needs more tests.

27:58.770 --> 28:01.771
You've only... wha...
so he may not be dying?

28:01.773 --> 28:03.039
Uh, maybe not.

28:03.041 --> 28:05.491
Why would you start with the fatal stuff?

28:05.493 --> 28:07.276
Aren't you supposed to rule out
the little things

28:07.278 --> 28:09.746
before you go scaring
the hell out of people like me?

28:09.748 --> 28:13.049
You're right, I... I should
rule out more common ailments.

28:13.051 --> 28:16.786
Yes, before you kill him off, you should.

28:16.788 --> 28:17.954
It's almost like you...

28:23.627 --> 28:26.980
um...

28:26.982 --> 28:30.567
Do you... do you want it
to be something horrible

28:30.569 --> 28:33.069
so that he won't be around anymore?

28:33.071 --> 28:35.772
Of course not. I'm a physician.

28:35.774 --> 28:38.241
Are you jealous of him?

28:40.661 --> 28:43.813
Divya and I have a completely
professional relationship.

28:43.815 --> 28:45.915
I didn't mention Divya.

28:49.920 --> 28:53.673
Jeremiah...

28:53.675 --> 28:55.258
Do you have feelings for her?

28:59.664 --> 29:02.932
- Jeremiah.
- I don't have feelings.

29:09.189 --> 29:12.341
She almost always has this one with her.

29:12.343 --> 29:13.342
Thank you.

29:13.344 --> 29:15.445
And, uh...

29:15.447 --> 29:18.982
are you sure that Fiona should
be studying in the hospital?

29:18.984 --> 29:21.017
Hank said it was okay.

29:21.019 --> 29:22.952
But shouldn't she be relaxing?

29:22.954 --> 29:25.238
Well, maybe keeping up with her schoolwork

29:25.240 --> 29:27.240
will make her feel more relaxed.

29:27.242 --> 29:29.191
Oh, God, maybe you're right.

29:29.193 --> 29:31.360
She's so different from me.

29:31.362 --> 29:34.196
She's smart and driven.

29:34.198 --> 29:37.000
- Oh, she always has been.
- Really?

29:37.002 --> 29:38.635
Oh, absolutely.

29:38.637 --> 29:40.136
Even when she was little,

29:40.138 --> 29:42.055
she only wanted the toys
she could build with.

29:42.057 --> 29:45.058
I couldn't buy Legos fast enough.

29:45.060 --> 29:47.143
And then one Christmas,

29:47.145 --> 29:49.512
I found this chemistry set for kids,

29:49.514 --> 29:52.548
and I just knew that she would love it.

29:54.818 --> 29:56.853
And now here she is.

29:56.855 --> 29:59.489
She's about to go to college,

29:59.491 --> 30:01.991
and, um...

30:01.993 --> 30:06.062
I never figured out a way
to be closer to her.

30:08.750 --> 30:11.501
We never had, you know,
a relationship that, um...

30:11.503 --> 30:13.569
that I hoped for.

30:13.571 --> 30:16.739
Well, it's never too late.

30:16.741 --> 30:19.676
She's my ba...

30:19.678 --> 30:22.011
she's my baby girl.

30:22.013 --> 30:23.579
Jackie, are you okay?

30:23.581 --> 30:25.848
I'm just... am fine. I'm just...

30:27.719 --> 30:29.769
Jackie, are...

30:29.771 --> 30:31.688
Jackie! What's...

30:31.690 --> 30:33.940
Jackie!

30:38.031 --> 30:39.665
- Hey.
- She's still not breathing.

30:39.667 --> 30:42.218
Okay. The ambulance is on its way.

30:46.557 --> 30:48.424
I... I tried mouth-to-mouth,

30:48.426 --> 30:50.376
but I haven't done it
since junior lifeguards.

30:50.378 --> 30:52.478
No, no, no, expired
air ventilation won't work.

30:52.480 --> 30:55.732
Her trachea's swollen.
She needs to be intubated.

30:55.734 --> 30:57.233
Okay, hold this.

30:57.235 --> 30:58.818
Can you take the tube out, please?

31:00.237 --> 31:02.888
Okay.

31:02.890 --> 31:04.073
Tube.

31:17.004 --> 31:19.872
Inflating the balloon.

31:21.008 --> 31:22.875
Can I have the ambu bag, please?

31:26.746 --> 31:29.081
Just... this happened so fast.

31:29.083 --> 31:31.100
She was upset,
and then she couldn't breathe.

31:31.102 --> 31:33.052
It's okay. Take over for me, please.

31:37.224 --> 31:38.924
And squeeze.

31:38.926 --> 31:41.277
Okay.

31:41.279 --> 31:42.695
And squeeze again.

31:42.697 --> 31:44.614
Okay, I hear breath sounds.

31:44.616 --> 31:47.567
She's getting oxygen now.

31:50.737 --> 31:54.874
Rash and swelling both linked to stress...

31:54.876 --> 31:57.627
I think I know what's going on
with mother and daughter.

31:57.629 --> 31:58.961
We have to call the hospital.

31:58.963 --> 32:00.580
Fiona doesn't need an appendectomy.

32:00.582 --> 32:04.467
Hey, welcome back.

32:04.469 --> 32:08.421
Just relax, Jackie.
Everything's gonna be okay.

32:08.423 --> 32:10.423
It's okay.

32:15.929 --> 32:19.432
You both have a condition known
as Quinke's disease.

32:19.434 --> 32:22.652
That sounds far more adorable
than what we experienced.

32:22.654 --> 32:25.404
Also known as hereditary angioedema.

32:25.406 --> 32:26.906
Much less adorable.

32:26.908 --> 32:30.142
Swelling develops rapidly
in your face, hands, feet,

32:30.144 --> 32:33.145
or, more seriously, your trachea
or intestinal tract.

32:33.147 --> 32:35.364
That's why you were experiencing
abdominal pain,

32:35.366 --> 32:37.166
dehydration, and nausea.

32:37.168 --> 32:39.151
And some patients get a nonpruritic rash,

32:39.153 --> 32:41.754
or a rash that doesn't itch.

32:41.756 --> 32:43.256
But why does it happen?

32:43.258 --> 32:44.790
There are several triggers.

32:44.792 --> 32:47.326
Trauma can be one, which is why
your foot swelled so big

32:47.328 --> 32:48.494
when the bookcase fell.

32:48.496 --> 32:51.130
Illness and surgery can be triggers

32:51.132 --> 32:53.766
and often stress.

32:53.768 --> 32:55.668
That would explain why I had my first rash

32:55.670 --> 32:57.336
when you were a baby.

32:57.338 --> 32:59.004
I was so tense all the time.

32:59.006 --> 33:02.358
I just knew I was doing something wrong.

33:02.360 --> 33:06.178
I cannot imagine you
stressed about anything.

33:06.180 --> 33:09.198
Well, when you started
turning out so well,

33:09.200 --> 33:12.017
nothing else seemed stressful anymore.

33:12.019 --> 33:14.070
I had a new perspective.

33:14.072 --> 33:15.738
Looks like you and your mom

33:15.740 --> 33:17.856
have more in common than you thought.

33:17.858 --> 33:19.858
This C1-inhibitor concentrate

33:19.860 --> 33:22.128
will help alleviate your symptoms,

33:22.130 --> 33:23.862
and you'll get medication to use

33:23.864 --> 33:25.665
if you feel another attack coming on.

33:25.667 --> 33:28.417
But the best way to guard
against future problems...

33:28.419 --> 33:31.003
stress management.

33:31.005 --> 33:34.924
Well, then I guess I should go with you

33:34.926 --> 33:37.226
to one of your meditation classes.

33:37.228 --> 33:38.678
I would love that.

33:38.680 --> 33:42.565
All you have to do is clear your mind.

33:42.567 --> 33:45.685
That's not possible.

33:45.687 --> 33:47.069
I'll help you.

33:47.071 --> 33:48.738
And great news
about your A.P. chem final...

33:48.740 --> 33:50.389
you are gonna be out of the hospital

33:50.391 --> 33:53.225
in time to take it
with your class after all.

33:53.227 --> 33:54.911
Um, what about my mom?

33:54.913 --> 33:57.163
She'll have to stay
another day just to be safe.

33:57.165 --> 34:00.899
Um...

34:00.901 --> 34:04.670
then I'll take the makeup test.

34:04.672 --> 34:07.072
I want to be here with you.

34:25.775 --> 34:27.976
Hey.

34:27.978 --> 34:31.697
It's my Hankmed hero.

34:31.699 --> 34:34.367
Hi.

34:34.369 --> 34:36.101
I heard you were amazing today.

34:36.103 --> 34:37.402
I was scared.

34:37.405 --> 34:40.373
Yeah, but you did it.

34:40.375 --> 34:43.108
You saved her life.

34:43.110 --> 34:45.543
That's pretty cool.

34:45.545 --> 34:48.614
You know what? Let's celebrate.

34:48.616 --> 34:49.947
I'm gonna make you some food.

34:49.949 --> 34:52.918
Evan...

34:54.420 --> 34:57.456
I miss my mom and dad.

34:57.458 --> 34:58.957
They're my parents.

34:58.959 --> 35:02.478
They've taken care of me my whole life,

35:02.480 --> 35:06.298
and they know me better than anyone.

35:06.300 --> 35:10.069
They may not have made me, but...

35:10.071 --> 35:11.988
they made me who I am.

35:11.990 --> 35:15.408
Will you come home with me?

35:15.410 --> 35:17.142
Of course I will.

35:22.148 --> 35:23.332
Right now?

35:23.334 --> 35:25.618
Yeah.

35:25.620 --> 35:29.255
Let's do this.

35:46.857 --> 35:48.858
Paige.

35:50.977 --> 35:53.863
Hi, mom.

35:53.865 --> 35:56.399
Dad.

36:05.375 --> 36:07.877
Oh, honey.

36:23.643 --> 36:25.394
I wish you had told me.

36:25.396 --> 36:27.012
I didn't want to worry you.

36:27.014 --> 36:29.348
It's, uh... it's nothing to worry about.

36:29.350 --> 36:30.516
Are you sure?

36:30.518 --> 36:32.234
I believe you have a radial nerve palsy.

36:32.236 --> 36:34.219
Honeymoon palsy?

36:34.221 --> 36:38.190
Yes, uh, it's called that
by laid peop... laypeople.

36:38.192 --> 36:41.694
Your radial nerve,
which controls the movement

36:41.696 --> 36:44.246
of your triceps and wrist
isn't working properly.

36:44.248 --> 36:45.915
You kept your arm immobilized

36:45.917 --> 36:47.833
and in an unusual position for too long.

36:47.835 --> 36:51.003
I've been sleeping on it.

36:51.005 --> 36:53.539
Oh, you should have woken me.

36:53.541 --> 36:54.840
Not for the world.

36:56.743 --> 36:58.544
And how is it that I can't move
my wrist at all?

36:58.546 --> 37:01.380
If you keep your arm
immobilized for several hours,

37:01.382 --> 37:03.933
you can damage the nerve
to the point of paralysis.

37:03.935 --> 37:06.418
- Wait. I'm paralyzed?
- No.

37:06.420 --> 37:08.921
You'll recover movement slowly over time.

37:11.925 --> 37:15.361
- Uh, may I?
- Yeah, of course.

37:15.363 --> 37:17.897
Okay, this is just a splint

37:17.899 --> 37:21.066
that will prevent overstretching
of the denervated muscle.

37:21.068 --> 37:23.602
Just, um, thread
your last three fingers through.

37:23.604 --> 37:26.104
- Okay.
- Good. And the thumb.

37:26.106 --> 37:27.656
That's good.

37:27.658 --> 37:31.410
How do you usually sleep
when you're with someone else?

37:33.380 --> 37:36.999
I've never been so comfortable
with someone in my arms.

37:37.001 --> 37:40.302
In fact, I don't know how
I'm gonna sleep without you now.

37:40.304 --> 37:42.555
I'll be very eager to get back to you.

37:42.557 --> 37:44.790
You will?

37:44.792 --> 37:46.392
Of course.

37:46.394 --> 37:50.062
These last few days have been
some of the happiest in my life,

37:50.064 --> 37:53.933
<i>mi preciosa.</i>

37:53.935 --> 37:56.769
You won't be able to sleep
together anymore...

37:56.771 --> 37:59.471
uh, in that position.

37:59.473 --> 38:01.273
We'll find different positions.

38:01.275 --> 38:03.442
Oh, uh, yes, that'll help.

38:03.444 --> 38:06.328
And I will recommend
some occupational therapy.

38:06.330 --> 38:07.663
Okay.

38:07.665 --> 38:10.282
- Thank you, Jeremiah.
- You're welcome.

38:26.332 --> 38:28.684
Oh, whoops.

38:44.901 --> 38:46.184
Hey.

38:46.186 --> 38:48.537
Whoever gave you that
must really like you.

38:50.024 --> 38:51.657
So much more useful
than a gourd with a straw.

38:51.659 --> 38:53.542
But his gift was engraved.

38:53.544 --> 38:55.377
There's only so much room on a pedometer.

38:55.379 --> 38:57.863
Hmm, guess you'll have
to get me something bigger...

38:57.865 --> 38:59.715
maybe a catered dinner party.

38:59.717 --> 39:01.000
I would take French.

39:01.002 --> 39:02.868
- Would you?
- Yeah.

39:02.870 --> 39:04.870
Actually, that whole dinner
got me thinking.

39:04.872 --> 39:07.389
If you're leaving me for Rafa,
I totally get it.

39:07.391 --> 39:09.808
It's not just the polo. He listens to me.

39:09.810 --> 39:12.377
In all our negotiating...

39:12.379 --> 39:14.396
about how this relationship would work,

39:14.398 --> 39:16.548
don't you think we skipped a step?

39:16.550 --> 39:17.850
What do you mean?

39:17.852 --> 39:19.217
The fun, falling for each other,

39:19.219 --> 39:21.320
"throw caution to the wind" part.

39:21.322 --> 39:23.188
- We skipped it.
- Yeah, you're right.

39:23.190 --> 39:27.076
There hasn't been much falling,
more like a controlled descent.

39:27.078 --> 39:29.411
I don't know...
maybe we've been too practical.

39:29.413 --> 39:31.363
You mean like being at an exercise class

39:31.365 --> 39:32.915
when most people are still in bed?

39:32.917 --> 39:34.500
No, I like that we have that in common,

39:34.502 --> 39:36.735
and I'm not saying
that we should go overboard.

39:36.737 --> 39:39.171
It's just...
it might be fun trying to get...

39:39.173 --> 39:40.205
- What's this?
- Oh...

39:40.207 --> 39:42.591
<i>The Other Side Of Ecstasy.</i>

39:42.593 --> 39:44.627
This is no mystery novel, my friend.

39:44.629 --> 39:46.712
A patient gave that to me.
I don't usually read...

39:46.714 --> 39:48.580
Did you get to chapter nine yet?

39:48.582 --> 39:50.516
I did.

39:58.358 --> 39:59.924
Come on, up off the ball!

39:59.926 --> 40:03.444
Let's do it. Warm-up time.

40:03.446 --> 40:05.613
Jumping jacks, jumping jacks!

40:05.615 --> 40:07.899
Immediately! Now!

40:07.901 --> 40:09.617
I hope you guys had your wheaties!

40:09.619 --> 40:13.705
Come on! Up, up, up!

40:13.707 --> 40:15.373
This is gonna be a tough one!

40:15.375 --> 40:16.708
Come on!

40:56.148 --> 40:59.167
Hi.

40:59.169 --> 41:01.035
Are you looking for Hankmed?

41:01.037 --> 41:03.171
I was expecting a... a waiting room.

41:03.173 --> 41:04.756
Yeah, we get that a lot.

41:04.758 --> 41:08.793
Uh, come on in.

41:08.795 --> 41:11.329
The, uh, Dan's papers' article
was a little misleading,

41:11.331 --> 41:13.047
but, uh, this is
a medical practice, though,

41:13.049 --> 41:14.382
believe it or not.

41:14.384 --> 41:15.700
It's a concierge medical practice.

41:15.702 --> 41:16.684
- Oh.
- Yeah.

41:16.686 --> 41:18.303
I'm Evan R. Lawson, CFO.

41:18.305 --> 41:20.021
The doctors are out right now,

41:20.023 --> 41:21.806
but I can make an appointment

41:21.808 --> 41:23.858
for someone to visit you at your home.

41:23.860 --> 41:27.812
Do you have a... a scheduler
or an office manager?

41:27.814 --> 41:29.948
She's not here either.

41:29.950 --> 41:32.317
I could make an appointment
for you, though.

41:32.319 --> 41:34.068
Um, it's okay.

41:34.070 --> 41:36.287
I'll just... I'll find
another way to contact her.

41:36.289 --> 41:39.324
I'm sorry... find another way
to contact who?

41:42.211 --> 41:44.295
Um...

41:44.297 --> 41:46.130
Are you looking for Paige?

41:46.132 --> 41:47.215
Yes. Yes.

41:47.217 --> 41:49.550
Oh.

41:49.552 --> 41:51.836
What's it regarding? I'm her fiancee.

41:53.589 --> 41:55.223
I'm...

41:55.225 --> 41:56.557
her mother.
