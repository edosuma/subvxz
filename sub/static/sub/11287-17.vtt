00:03.100 --> 00:06.066
SYNCLAIRE, I LOVE
THE WAY THE SUNLIGHT

00:06.133 --> 00:07.833
MAKES YOUR FACE GLOW.

00:07.900 --> 00:11.766
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,
BE MY BRIDE.

00:11.833 --> 00:13.366
OH, I'M FLATTERED, BUT NO.

00:13.433 --> 00:15.633
AND IT'S ACTUALLY
"COMBINATION SKIN."

00:15.700 --> 00:19.333
AIN'T GOT NOTHIN' TO DO
WITH THE SUN, DADDY.

00:19.400 --> 00:22.533
KHADIJAH, I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO GET THIS OFF MY CHEST

00:22.600 --> 00:25.166
FOR A LONG TIME‐‐
I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.066
BIG‐BONED GIRL, MARRY ME!

00:27.133 --> 00:29.000
GET UP, JERK CHICKEN.

00:29.066 --> 00:31.666
YOU KNOW NOBODY
PROPOSES TO KHADIJAH

00:31.733 --> 00:33.166
BUT ME AROUND HERE.

00:33.233 --> 00:36.600
HEY, SAVE YOUR THREATS UNTIL
YOUR VOICE CHANGES, BO‐BO BOY.

00:36.666 --> 00:38.866
IVAN, GO GROW SOME FACIAL HAIR.

00:38.933 --> 00:40.666
RUSSELL, YOU JUST GROW.

00:40.733 --> 00:42.533
NOW, LET ME GUESS.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.533
DOES THIS PROPOSAL
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO

00:44.600 --> 00:46.466
WITH YOUR LITTLE
IMMIGRATION PROBLEM?

00:46.533 --> 00:47.966
WELL, YES.

00:48.033 --> 00:49.300
MY WORK VISA HAS EXPIRED

00:49.366 --> 00:51.266
AND I'M IN DANGER
OF BEING DEPORTED.

00:51.333 --> 00:53.733
THEY SENT THE RENEWAL FORM
TO MY OLD ADDRESS.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.266
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST SEND OUT
CHANGE OF ADDRESS CARDS?

00:56.333 --> 00:59.700
THEN I'D GET
ALL THOSE DAMN BILLS.

00:59.766 --> 01:02.806
LOOK, KHADIJAH, IF I DON'T
FIND SOMEONE TO MARRY

01:02.873 --> 01:04.373
IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS

01:04.440 --> 01:06.540
I'LL BE SHIPPED BACK
TO KINGSTON.

01:06.606 --> 01:07.973
COULD YOU MENTION ME

01:08.040 --> 01:10.140
TO YOUR BUSTY,
POUTY ROOMMATE REGINE?

01:10.206 --> 01:12.640
TRUST ME,
YOU'D RATHER BE DEPORTED.

OOH, MICHELLE, YOU
ALMOST HAD THE PICTURE.

01:47.780 --> 01:50.514
NOW J. J. AND WILLONA
ARE ALL SQUIGGLY.

01:50.580 --> 01:53.780
YEAH, BUT FLORIDA
NEVER LOOKED BETTER.

01:53.847 --> 01:56.114
HOW ABOUT... NOW?

01:56.180 --> 01:57.814
PERFECT!

01:57.880 --> 02:03.420
OH! OH! WE'VE BEEN WATCHING
SALLY JESSY RAPHAEL ALL ALONG.

02:03.487 --> 02:05.620
SORRY YOU HAD TO COME OUT
FOUR TIMES THIS MONTH.

02:05.687 --> 02:06.720
OH, NO PROBLEM.

02:06.787 --> 02:09.687
I LIKE THE TENANTS HERE.

02:10.919 --> 02:14.620
WELL, FEEL FREE
TO TAKE THEM WITH YOU.

02:14.687 --> 02:16.420
YOU KNOW, KYLE,
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY

02:16.487 --> 02:19.787
I MEET SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HIS WAY
AROUND A PAIR OF WIRE CUTTERS

02:19.854 --> 02:21.520
AND HAS A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR.

02:21.587 --> 02:24.054
WELL, PEOPLE DO SAY
I HAVE A DRY WIT.

02:24.120 --> 02:26.687
LIKE A FREAKIN' DESERT.

02:28.220 --> 02:30.020
I'M GOING TO
THE GUGGENHEIM TOMORROW.

02:30.087 --> 02:32.320
IT'S THE LAST DAY OF
THE CLAES OLDENBURG EXHIBIT.

02:32.387 --> 02:33.987
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME WITH?

02:34.054 --> 02:38.887
UM... AS MUCH AS I AM INSPIRED
BY HIS GIANT NAUGAHYDE BURGERS

02:38.954 --> 02:41.054
I'M SORRY, I MUST DECLINE.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.987
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND...

02:44.754 --> 02:46.587
GIVE ME A CALL.

02:50.820 --> 02:51.987
HEY, BROTHER

02:52.054 --> 02:54.354
SHE WAS SETTING IT OUT,
WASN'T SHE, SHORTY?

02:54.420 --> 02:56.854
SHE DID EVERYTHING
BUT STRIP NAKED

02:56.920 --> 02:59.394
AND DO THE
HOOCHIE‐MAMA DANCE.

03:01.060 --> 03:03.494
AND KYLE DID EVERYTHING
BUT OPEN HIS SHIRT

03:03.560 --> 03:05.760
AND SHOW HER HIS ONE CHEST HAIR.

03:05.827 --> 03:07.027
COME ON, MAX.

03:07.094 --> 03:09.760
ALL I DID WAS HAND THE LADY
A FEW TOOLS

03:09.827 --> 03:12.194
AND LET MY NATURAL CHARM
SHINE THROUGH.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.260
KYLE, SAVE YOUR BREATH.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.594
YOU CAN FLIRT WITH HER

03:15.660 --> 03:16.360
YOU CAN CALL HER,
YOU CAN GO OUT WITH HER‐‐

03:16.427 --> 03:17.594
I DON'T CARE.

03:19.994 --> 03:22.994
WAIT. I'M TRYING TO HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU

03:23.060 --> 03:26.327
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME
TO GO OUT WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

03:26.394 --> 03:28.127
WHAT ARE YOU NOW, MY PIMP?

03:28.194 --> 03:29.960
I'M CERTAINLY NOT YOUR WARDEN.

03:30.027 --> 03:32.527
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

03:32.594 --> 03:36.894
MAXINE, DO NOT PLAY GAMES
WITH ME, BECAUSE I WILL GO.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.727
I'M NOT PLAYING ANY GAMES.

03:39.794 --> 03:41.227
I REALLY DON'T CARE.

03:41.294 --> 03:43.560
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

03:43.627 --> 03:45.960
THAT'S RIGHT.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.360
HEY, WHAT'S UP, MAN?

03:48.427 --> 03:52.494
PRETTY TONY OVER THERE
JUST SENT ME ON A RUN.

03:55.594 --> 03:57.927
BOSS LADY, I KNOW
YOU'LL BE CRUSHED

03:57.994 --> 04:00.800
BUT I'M WITHDRAWING
MY MARRIAGE PROPOSAL.

04:00.867 --> 04:02.334
I UNDERSTAND.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.267
NO WOMAN, NO CRY, HUH?

04:05.334 --> 04:08.334
I DO, HOWEVER,
HAVE ANOTHER PROPOSAL.

04:08.400 --> 04:11.134
DOES IT INVOLVE PAYING BACK
THE $20 YOU OWE ME?

04:11.200 --> 04:14.200
PLEASE. THIS IS
NO TIME FOR JOKES.

04:14.267 --> 04:17.166
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TELL AN IMMIGRATION AGENT

04:17.233 --> 04:19.466
THAT I'M ESSENTIAL TO <i>FLAVOR</i>

04:19.534 --> 04:21.700
AND THERE'S NO AMERICAN
WHO CAN REPLACE ME.

04:21.767 --> 04:23.834
SO YOU WANT ME TO LIE.

04:23.900 --> 04:25.534
JUST EMBELLISH THE TRUTH

04:25.600 --> 04:28.500
UNTIL IT MEANS SOMETHING
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

04:28.567 --> 04:30.767
IT'S THE AMERICAN WAY.

04:30.834 --> 04:32.067
I DON'T KNOW, RUSSELL.

04:32.134 --> 04:33.067
PLEASE, KHADIJAH.

04:33.133 --> 04:35.067
I WORK VERY HARD FOR YOU.

04:35.133 --> 04:37.467
DON'T SEND ME BACK
TO JAMAICA.

04:37.533 --> 04:41.167
IT'S TOO DAMN HOT!

04:41.234 --> 04:44.467
WELL, YOU ARE
A GOOD MUSIC EDITOR...

04:44.534 --> 04:47.200
AND YOU DO GET ME
ALL THAT FREE INCENSE.

04:47.267 --> 04:48.967
ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO IT.

04:49.034 --> 04:51.934
GOOD, BECAUSE THE
IMMIGRATION AGENT
IS HERE.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.600
WELL, WHAT IF I
WERE TO SAY NO?

04:54.667 --> 04:57.500
THEN THIS WOULD BE
A VERY AWKWARD MEETING.

04:57.567 --> 05:00.907
MR. MONTEGO, I'M AGENT
TANAKA FROM THE I. N. S.

05:00.974 --> 05:03.474
AGENT TANAKA, THIS
IS KHADIJAH JAMES

05:03.540 --> 05:04.707
MY PROUD SPONSOR.

05:04.774 --> 05:06.140
GO AHEAD, MS. JAMES.

05:06.207 --> 05:09.174
TELL AGENT TANAKA
HOW ESSENTIAL I AM.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.274
OH, YEAH.

05:10.340 --> 05:13.940
BOY, <i>ESSENTIAL.</i>

05:14.007 --> 05:15.774
ESSENTIAL...

05:15.840 --> 05:17.674
IRREPLACEABLE RUSSELL.

05:17.740 --> 05:20.540
CONVINCING ARGUMENT.

05:20.607 --> 05:22.607
BUT REGULATIONS DICTATE

05:22.674 --> 05:24.374
I OBSERVE MR. MONTEGO
IN THE WORKPLACE.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.240
( beep )

05:26.307 --> 05:29.807
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO CUT THIS PARTY SHORT.

05:29.874 --> 05:32.040
WE'RE RAIDING
A SYNTHETIC HAIR SWEATSHOP

05:32.107 --> 05:33.907
ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE.

05:33.974 --> 05:38.074
WE'LL CONTINUE THIS
TOMORROW MORNING AT 8:30.

05:38.140 --> 05:40.074
RUSSELL, THIS COULD
BE A PROBLEM.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.207
YOU'RE TELLING ME.

05:42.274 --> 05:43.707
MY COUSIN MANAGES
THAT SWEATSHOP.

05:43.774 --> 05:47.774
DEEBA? THEY'RE COMING, MAN.

05:50.440 --> 05:53.107
HEY, YOU GUYS, CANCEL YOUR PLANS
FOR SATURDAY NIGHT.

05:53.174 --> 05:55.374
WE ARE GOING
TO SEE BRIAN McKNIGHT

05:55.440 --> 05:56.840
COURTESY OF MOI.

05:56.907 --> 05:58.640
Khadijah:
THAT SHOW'S BEEN

05:58.707 --> 06:00.147
SOLD OUT FOR WEEKS.

06:00.214 --> 06:02.214
HOW'D YOU GET TICKETS?

06:02.280 --> 06:03.547
I GOT THE TICKETS
FROM NATHAN

06:03.614 --> 06:06.214
WHO PLAYS THE CONNIVING
PROCTOLOGIST ON THE SOAP.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.680
HE EVEN GAVE ME
AN EXTRA TICKET TO SCALP.

06:08.747 --> 06:10.147
WHY BOTHER SCALPING IT?

06:10.214 --> 06:12.114
I'M SURE MAX HAS ANOTHER WOMAN

06:12.180 --> 06:14.647
SHE WANTS TO FORCE KYLE
TO GO OUT WITH.

06:14.714 --> 06:17.047
OH, YES! TONIGHT
IS KYLE'S DATE

06:17.114 --> 06:18.914
WITH THE CABLE LADY.

06:18.980 --> 06:20.847
SO WHAT DID
YOU THINK, MAX?

06:20.914 --> 06:25.180
SHE GOING TO GIVE BROTHER
SOME FREE "SHOWTIME"?

06:25.247 --> 06:29.047
YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES

06:29.114 --> 06:30.914
OF MY RELATIONSHIP WITH KYLE.

06:30.980 --> 06:32.914
LET HIM TASTE
THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT.

06:32.980 --> 06:36.580
THEN HE'LL SEE HOW SWEET
IT IS AT HOME.

06:36.647 --> 06:38.614
YEAH, BUT IF I KNOW KYLE

06:38.680 --> 06:41.147
FORBIDDEN'S HIS FAVORITE FLAVOR.

06:42.547 --> 06:43.847
MAX, LET'S KEEP IT REAL.

06:43.914 --> 06:45.847
WE BOTH KNOW
YOU DIDN'T WANT KYLE

06:45.914 --> 06:47.414
TO GO OUT WITH THAT WOMAN.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.214
YOU TRIED TO PLAY
IT ALL COOL

06:49.280 --> 06:50.814
AND GOT YOUR
FACE CRACKED.

06:50.880 --> 06:54.214
YEAH! WHAT IF MICHELLE
AND KYLE HIT IT OFF?

06:54.280 --> 06:58.514
PLEASE. ONCE YOU GO MAX,
YOU NEVER GO BACK.

06:58.580 --> 07:01.154
YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME
YOU DON'T GIVE A DAMN?

07:01.220 --> 07:02.654
I COULDN'T BE LESS PRESSED.

07:02.720 --> 07:03.720
( door closes )

07:03.787 --> 07:04.787
KYLE'S HOME.

07:13.220 --> 07:14.654
OH, HEY, KYLE!

07:14.720 --> 07:17.354
YOU'RE LOOKING...
YOU'RE LOOKING SHARP THERE.

07:17.420 --> 07:18.720
OH, YEAH!

07:18.787 --> 07:21.587
YOU HAD YOUR LITTLE DATE
WITH YOUR LITTLE FRIEND.

07:21.654 --> 07:23.520
UH‐HUH.

07:23.587 --> 07:25.020
HOW'D IT GO?

07:25.087 --> 07:28.120
WELL, IT TURNS OUT SHE'S NOT
AS INSIGHTFUL AS I HAD HOPED.

07:28.187 --> 07:30.020
SHE SPENT AN HOUR
LOOKING AT THE WALL

07:30.087 --> 07:31.954
THINKING IT WAS
AN ABSTRACT PAINTING.

07:32.020 --> 07:33.120
OH...

07:33.187 --> 07:34.620
SO WHAT ARE YOU GUYS?

07:34.687 --> 07:36.854
WHAT ARE YOU, "BUDDIES" OR...?

07:39.720 --> 07:42.087
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

07:42.154 --> 07:44.987
BUT I WILL SAY IT WAS REFRESHING
BEING WITH SOMEONE

07:45.054 --> 07:48.320
WHO WASN'T AFRAID TO TELL ME
THAT SHE ENJOYED MY COMPANY.

07:48.387 --> 07:51.520
SHE ENJOYED
A BLANK WALL, KYLE‐‐

07:51.587 --> 07:54.220
HOW GOOD CAN YOU FEEL?

07:54.287 --> 07:57.520
IT WAS ALSO REFRESHING
BEING WITH SOMEONE

07:57.587 --> 08:01.194
WHO DIDN'T CONSTANTLY
TAKE POTSHOTS AT ME.

08:01.260 --> 08:03.294
WELL, GIVE HER TIME.

08:03.360 --> 08:05.994
TO KNOW YOU IS TO DIS YOU.

08:06.060 --> 08:07.260
YOU KNOW, WOMAN, YOU...

08:07.327 --> 08:09.360
YOU MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE
TO TALK TO YOU.

08:09.427 --> 08:10.894
EVERYTHING IS A TUG‐OF‐WAR.

08:10.960 --> 08:12.594
KYLE, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

08:12.660 --> 08:14.727
I WANT A WOMAN
WHO IS AFFECTIONATE.

08:14.794 --> 08:18.094
I WANT A WOMAN WHO HAS A PICTURE
OF ME IN HER APARTMENT.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.594
I WANT A WOMAN

08:19.660 --> 08:22.227
WHO DOES NOT SEND ME OUT
ON DATES WITH OTHER WOMEN.

08:25.660 --> 08:28.127
I DO HAVE PICTURES OF YOU.

08:28.194 --> 08:30.460
THEY MAKE WONDERFUL COASTERS.

08:31.827 --> 08:33.460
YOU KNOW...

08:33.527 --> 08:36.827
YOU HAVE NEVER TAKEN ME
OR THIS RELATIONSHIP SERIOUSLY.

08:36.894 --> 08:38.927
OH, COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.

08:38.994 --> 08:40.860
GET OFF OF IT, KYLE.

08:40.927 --> 08:42.159
YOU DON'T WANT A GIRLFRIEND

08:42.227 --> 08:44.594
YOU WANT A PSYCHIATRIST
WHO'S GOOD IN BED.

08:44.660 --> 08:46.094
"LISTEN TO MY PROBLEMS."

08:46.160 --> 08:47.427
"LISTEN TO MY <i>PROB‐LEMS..."</i>

08:47.494 --> 08:49.927
WELL, HEY, LOOK,
IF I DON'T MAKE YOU HAPPY

08:49.994 --> 08:51.994
THEN WHY ARE YOU WITH ME?

08:54.660 --> 08:56.694
GOOD POINT.

08:56.760 --> 09:00.867
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST SAY
I AM NO LONGER WITH YOU?

09:07.367 --> 09:10.400
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

09:10.467 --> 09:15.100
WE'RE THROUGH. IT'S OVER.
DON'T WANT YOU. BYE‐BYE.

09:19.834 --> 09:21.367
( sighs )

09:25.067 --> 09:26.667
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY BROKE UP.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.867
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY WERE EVER TOGETHER.

09:30.382 --> 09:31.373
THIS NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

09:31.440 --> 09:33.073
IF THEY HAD TO FOLLOW
MY LOVE AGENDA.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.873
THREE MONTHS TO HOLD HANDS,
SIX MONTHS FOR A HUG

09:35.940 --> 09:37.207
A YEAR FOR A KISS.

09:37.273 --> 09:38.940
HEY, BY THE TURN OF THE CENTURY

09:39.007 --> 09:40.873
THEY'D HAVE BEEN JUMPING
THE BROOM.

09:40.940 --> 09:43.040
NOW, HOW COULD THEY
JUMP THE BROOM

09:43.107 --> 09:44.973
IF SHE'S ALWAYS RIDING IT?

09:45.040 --> 09:47.840
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT TO
GET THEM BACK TOGETHER.

09:47.907 --> 09:49.640
I FEEL LIKE
THIS IS MY FAULT.

09:49.707 --> 09:51.373
WHY?

09:51.440 --> 09:52.640
I DON'T KNOW.

09:52.707 --> 09:55.040
I HAVE A GENERAL GUILT
ABOUT THINGS, YOU KNOW.

09:55.107 --> 09:58.040
OH. GOOD, OVERTON,
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

09:58.107 --> 09:59.647
LOOK, I'VE BROUGHT BACK

09:59.713 --> 10:02.380
KYLE'S PRECIOUS
FRAGILE BELONGINGS.

10:04.713 --> 10:07.813
AW, DANG, GIRL, THAT'S
MY CLEVELAND BROWNS MUG

10:07.880 --> 10:09.313
AND IT'S BROKEN.

10:09.380 --> 10:11.647
WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

10:11.713 --> 10:13.880
THEY'RE LEAVING
CLEVELAND ANYWAY.

10:16.113 --> 10:17.813
GIRL, YOU OKAY?

10:17.880 --> 10:20.713
YEAH, I'M ALL RIGHT,
BUT HIM...

10:22.080 --> 10:23.347
LOOK.

10:23.413 --> 10:24.447
CHECK THIS OUT.

10:24.513 --> 10:26.713
KYLE WAS TOO
HIGH‐MAINTENANCE ANYWAY.

10:26.780 --> 10:29.213
I MEAN, ALWAYS TRYING
TO GET CLOSE.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.480
YEAH, WE ALL KNOW
HOW MUCH YOU HATE THAT.

10:31.547 --> 10:32.813
EXACTLY.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.413
I MEAN, I HAD TO SEE HIM.

10:34.480 --> 10:35.813
I HAD TO TALK TO HIM.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.813
IT'S LIKE HAVING
A DAMN SECOND JOB.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.347
( knock at door )

10:39.413 --> 10:40.247
HEY, IS...?

10:40.313 --> 10:41.247
LOOK, LOOK.

10:41.313 --> 10:42.647

MAXINE IS HERE.

10:45.147 --> 10:48.747
REUNITED.
DOESN'T IT FEEL SO GOOD?

10:48.813 --> 10:50.480
SWAY WITH ME.

10:52.313 --> 10:53.647
I'LL JUST GO.

10:55.547 --> 10:56.813
LOOK.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.213
HERE'S YOUR STUFF.

10:59.820 --> 11:02.420

THAT I GET BACK

11:02.487 --> 11:04.420
EVERY SINGLE ITEM

11:04.487 --> 11:06.820
I EVER LEFT IN
YOUR APARTMENT.

11:08.153 --> 11:10.053
CERTAINLY.

11:10.120 --> 11:10.953
I'LL FED‐EX YOUR TOOTHBRUSH.

11:11.020 --> 11:12.587
WHAT ABOUT
MY TOOTHPASTE?

11:12.653 --> 11:14.653
IT HARDENED AND BROKE.

11:14.720 --> 11:16.753
"HARDENED AND BROKE."

11:16.820 --> 11:18.420
I DON'T BUY THAT, MAN.

11:18.487 --> 11:20.487
HE BETTER FIND MY TOOTHPASTE.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.420
THANKS.

11:26.487 --> 11:27.753
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11:27.820 --> 11:30.253
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
THAT WAS SECURITY.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.087
AGENT TANAKA'S ON HER WAY UP.

11:32.153 --> 11:33.320
PLACES, EVERYBODY!

11:35.820 --> 11:37.187
PERFECT!

11:38.787 --> 11:40.320
( clears throat )

11:41.853 --> 11:43.653
NICE PICTURE OF YOU.

11:43.720 --> 11:44.953
OH. THAT OLD THING.

11:45.020 --> 11:47.587
IT'S NOT CONSTANTLY WINNING
THAT EMBARRASSES ME.

11:47.653 --> 11:50.453
IT'S WHEN THEY CARRY ME AROUND
ON THEIR SHOULDERS.

11:50.520 --> 11:54.087
IT'S LIKE HOISTING
A LITTLE JAMAICAN ANGEL.

11:54.153 --> 11:56.787
RUSSELL, DO YOU HAVE
THE LATEST RECORD REVIEWS?

11:56.853 --> 12:01.193
KHADIJAH,
THEY'RE CALLED CDs NOW.

12:01.260 --> 12:06.393
MY FRIEND, YOU ARE
TRULY INDISPENSABLE.

12:09.660 --> 12:12.593
ALL RIGHT, BOSS, I'M READY
FOR MY NEXT ASSIGNMENT.

12:12.660 --> 12:13.593
OH, GOOD.

12:13.660 --> 12:15.893
I NEED YOU TO RUN
TO MANHATTAN

12:15.960 --> 12:17.360
AND PICK UP SOME PHOTOS
AT THIS ADDRESS.

12:17.427 --> 12:18.693
OH, NO PROBLEM.

12:18.760 --> 12:20.360
ONLY...

12:20.427 --> 12:22.727
I WISH I KNEW
HOW TO GET THERE.

12:22.793 --> 12:27.027
MY FRIEND, TAKE THE
TWO TRAIN TO BROADWAY

12:27.093 --> 12:29.193
THEN CATCH THE FOUR
GOING UPTOWN.

12:29.260 --> 12:32.960
GET OFF ON BLEECKER
AND GO TWO BLOCKS NORTH.

12:33.027 --> 12:35.927
OR YOU COULD TAKE
THE FOUR STRAIGHT TO BROADWAY.

12:37.627 --> 12:38.460
THAT'S A LOT QUICKER.

12:38.527 --> 12:39.760
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING?

12:39.827 --> 12:42.260
OH, BUT RUSSELL PROPOSES
A MORE SCENIC ROUTE

12:42.327 --> 12:44.127
THAT'S SURE TO LIFT MY SPIRITS.

12:44.193 --> 12:45.127
THANKS, RUSSELL.

12:45.193 --> 12:46.160
YOU'RE THE MAN.

12:46.227 --> 12:48.127
I DON'T NEED TO SEE ANY MORE.

12:48.193 --> 12:49.660
THEN I CAN STAY?

12:49.727 --> 12:52.127
UNTIL YOUR PLANE LEAVES.

12:52.193 --> 12:54.127
I'VE ENJOYED
YOUR LITTLE SKETCH

12:54.193 --> 12:55.593
BUT THERE'S NO REASON

12:55.660 --> 12:58.660
FOR YOUR CO‐WORKERS TO EMBARRASS
THEMSELVES ANY FURTHER.

12:58.727 --> 13:01.533
YOU WILL BE RECEIVING
AN OFFICIAL DEPORTATION NOTICE

13:01.600 --> 13:03.100
WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

13:03.167 --> 13:04.467
BUT, BUT, UH...

13:04.533 --> 13:07.967
I‐I‐IF RUSSELL LEAVES,
HOW WOULD WE EVER PUT OUT

13:08.033 --> 13:10.500
THE PATOIS EDITION
OF <i>FLAVOR?</i>

13:10.567 --> 13:12.000
PATOIS EDITION?

13:12.067 --> 13:13.333
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.633
KHADIJAH IS EXPANDING
OUR MARKET BASE

13:15.700 --> 13:18.300

13:18.367 --> 13:20.033
RIGHT, KHADIJAH?

13:20.100 --> 13:21.633
RIGHT.

13:21.700 --> 13:24.033
I'M EXPANDING OUR MARKET BASE

13:24.100 --> 13:26.767
BY DISTRIBUTING FLAVOR
IN THE WEST INDIES.

13:26.833 --> 13:29.067
A MAGAZINE IN PATOIS?

13:29.133 --> 13:31.900
IT'S THE LANGUAGE
OF JAMAICA.

13:31.967 --> 13:35.667

ACKEE AND SALT FISH.

13:40.567 --> 13:42.500
THEN WE CAN YAM IT DOWN.

13:43.667 --> 13:44.933
RUSSELL

13:45.000 --> 13:47.300
ARE YOU TALKING DIRTY
TO AGENT TANAKA?

13:47.367 --> 13:48.300
NOT REALLY.

13:48.367 --> 13:49.467
LOOSELY TRANSLATED

13:49.533 --> 13:51.433
HE THINKS I GOT IT GOIN' ON.

13:56.567 --> 13:58.500
MY EX‐BOYFRIEND WAS JAMAICAN.

13:58.567 --> 14:01.273
SOMETIMES I WISH
I HADN'T DEPORTED HIM.

14:02.407 --> 14:03.907
SO, YOU DO HAVE A HEART.

14:03.973 --> 14:05.907
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

14:05.973 --> 14:07.240
WELL, IT APPEARS

14:07.307 --> 14:09.573

18:53.343 --> 18:57.643
WELL, I GUESS YOU LET
YOUR EMOTIONS GET INVOLVED.

18:57.710 --> 19:01.983
WELL, EXCUSE ME, TIN MAN,
BUT I HAVE A HEART.

OKAY, KYLE, COME ON.

19:05.916 --> 19:08.083
DON'T START TALKING
ABOUT FEELINGS AGAIN.

19:08.150 --> 19:09.783

19:09.850 --> 19:14.516
YOU KNOW, MAXINE, ALL THIS TIME
WE HAVE BEEN TOGETHER

19:14.583 --> 19:18.216

I MEAN, WHAT, WHAT
DO YOU CARE ABOUT?

19:22.883 --> 19:25.616
FOOD, SHELTER,
MY CAREER AND GOOD SEX.

19:30.550 --> 19:32.483
WELL, I GUESS I
GAVE YOU MORE CREDIT

19:32.550 --> 19:33.883

19:33.950 --> 19:35.550
OH.

19:35.616 --> 19:38.050
I GUESS YOU'LL RUN
THROUGH A MEADOW

19:38.116 --> 19:39.883

19:43.883 --> 19:45.983
