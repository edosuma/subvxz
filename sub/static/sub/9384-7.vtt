"It seems today that all you see

00:04.463 --> 00:07.716
"is violence in movies and sex on TV

TOM: It was a moving scene today
at Hatch Pond...

00:34.868 --> 00:38.372
...as six members of the Pawtucket
fire department struggled valiantly...

00:38.455 --> 00:41.166
...to save a fish's life
trapped under the frozen ice.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.627
Rescue workers got the fish
out of the water...

00:43.710 --> 00:45.963
...but unfortunately
it died shortly after.

00:46.839 --> 00:47.840
Diane?

00:47.923 --> 00:50.342
Tom, another life
was tragically cut short today.

00:50.425 --> 00:54.221
Robert Kimble, founder of a local theater
group known as the Quahog Players...

00:54.304 --> 00:55.639
...passed away this afternoon.

00:55.722 --> 00:56.765
Oh, my God!

00:56.849 --> 00:57.975
[Phone ringing]

00:58.058 --> 01:01.353
Kimble was a hands-on director who
often appeared in his own shows...

...most recently, Miss Saigon.

01:03.272 --> 01:05.816

01:05.899 --> 01:08.569

01:09.027 --> 01:11.738
Yes, I just heard. It's so sad.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.448
Really?

01:13.657 --> 01:16.869
They want me to be the new
artistic director of the Quahog Players!

01:16.952 --> 01:18.954
-All right, Mom!
-Are you gonna do it?

01:19.037 --> 01:22.124
I don't know.
It's such a big responsibility.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.792
I need a moment to think.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.673
Okay, I'll do it.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.176
This just in.
Lois Griffin is named the new

01:32.259 --> 01:34.386
artistic director of the Quahog Players.

01:34.469 --> 01:37.347
All those years of paying my dues
as musical director...

01:37.431 --> 01:39.850
...under that old hack
have finally paid off.

01:40.142 --> 01:41.518
Lois, congratulations.

01:41.602 --> 01:45.063
Our little theater group finally has
a committed visionary at its helm.

01:45.147 --> 01:46.648
And such an attractive one.

01:46.732 --> 01:49.443
Brian, you'll have to audition
just like everyone else.

01:49.526 --> 01:50.861
God, of course. I...

01:50.944 --> 01:53.447
You didn't think... You thought I was...

01:53.530 --> 01:54.573
Lois!

01:54.656 --> 01:57.451
-I can paint scenery.
-Can I be in the show, Mom?

01:57.534 --> 02:00.913
Yes, you can be the dumpy teenager
who stays backstage and cries...

02:00.996 --> 02:03.081
...because nobody finds her attractive.

02:03.165 --> 02:04.625
[Laughing]

02:04.708 --> 02:07.419
-Hey, you guys.
-Peter, guess what? I am gonna--

02:07.503 --> 02:10.589
Me first! Mr. Weed said
whoever comes up with the best idea...

02:10.672 --> 02:13.425
...for the big Christmas toy this year
gets a huge bonus.

02:13.509 --> 02:15.844
Hey, Dad,
why don't you invent the Frisbee?

02:15.928 --> 02:17.262
That's an awesome toy.

02:17.346 --> 02:20.557
-It's already been invented.
-Then how come I never heard of it?

02:20.724 --> 02:23.977
This is my chance to prove
how valuable I am to the company!

02:24.228 --> 02:25.938
Sorry, Lois. What's your news?

02:26.021 --> 02:27.147
Well, I...

02:31.735 --> 02:34.154
Mr. Weed,
distinguished members of the board...

02:34.238 --> 02:36.740
...may I present
this year's hottest toy...

02:36.823 --> 02:38.534
...Mr. Zucchini Head.

02:38.825 --> 02:43.705
He's got stupid cool hip-hop style
with his little hat and his Doc Martens.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.333
Thank you, Peter, that's enough.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.211
Wait. This is the best part! He dances!

02:49.753 --> 02:51.672
MAN #1: I've seen enough.
MAN #2: Inappropriate.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.215
MAN #3: I haven't had sex in ages.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.676
Gentlemen,
I apologize for wasting your time.

02:55.759 --> 02:58.095
Peter is an adequate
assembly-line worker...

02:58.178 --> 03:01.890
...but you'll be happy to know
our company does not pay him to think.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.016
[Laughing]

03:03.100 --> 03:04.893
[Nervous laughter]

03:04.977 --> 03:06.270
I'll take this.

03:06.728 --> 03:07.729
No calls.

03:09.982 --> 03:13.193
Come on, kids! The director can't be late
for the auditions.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.362
You should've heard them laughing at me.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.657
I got great ideas, but they look at me,
and all they see is a loser.

03:18.740 --> 03:22.286
Except that guy with the lazy eye.
He sees a loser and the snack machine.

03:22.369 --> 03:25.539
Peter, a lot of creative people
had mindless jobs.

03:25.622 --> 03:28.166
Michelangelo worked in a marble quarry.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.836
Herman Melville was a customs agent.

03:31.170 --> 03:33.630
Albert Einstein
worked for the patent office.

03:34.506 --> 03:36.800
And what is it you want to patent,
Herr Smith?

03:36.884 --> 03:39.261
I call it "Smith's Theory of Relativity."

03:40.387 --> 03:41.930
-Hey, look at this.
-What?

03:45.893 --> 03:47.644
BRIAN: I think Lois is saying that...

03:47.728 --> 03:50.564
...you have to find a way
to express yourself creatively.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.357
For example, Chris has his drawing,

03:52.441 --> 03:55.569
Meg does her birdcalls,
I sing beautifully.

03:56.028 --> 03:57.196
So I've heard.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.031
And Lois has her theater group.

03:59.114 --> 04:02.701
Yes. And for my first production,
I've chosen The King and I.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.746
It's a wonderful story
about a loving, patient woman...

04:05.829 --> 04:10.083
...who introduces culture and civility
to a barbaric, patriarchal...

04:10.292 --> 04:12.878
Peter, please don't wipe your nose
on the couch.

04:13.629 --> 04:15.088
Look, I have to go.

04:15.172 --> 04:18.550
Part of being creative is figuring out
what you're good at.

04:18.634 --> 04:21.303
I know you can do it
if you put your mind to it.

04:21.386 --> 04:25.516
You're right. Man was meant to create.
That's why God invented Shrinky Dinks.

04:26.183 --> 04:29.061
It works! Look how tiny they are!

JOE: Bravo!

04:58.298 --> 05:01.844
LOIS: Brian, that was beautiful!
Thank you!

05:01.927 --> 05:03.470
No, thank you.

05:03.595 --> 05:07.808
And that note you gave me, "louder,"
I was thinking that, and then you said it.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.518
BRIAN: You're so intuitive.
It's a pleasure--

05:09.601 --> 05:11.478
LOIS: Okay. Next!

Hey, can somebody give me a hand
with all this talent?

05:45.387 --> 05:46.889
Peter, what are you doing here?

05:46.972 --> 05:49.975
Well, Lois, I tried finding my creativity,
like you said.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.518
First I took an art class.

05:52.603 --> 05:55.272
Am I supposed to draw the penis?

05:55.772 --> 05:57.274
Then I tried sculpting.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.361
Am I supposed to sculpt the penis?

06:01.445 --> 06:02.696
Then I tried music.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.950
Am I supposed to conduct with my penis?

06:07.034 --> 06:09.536
I started to think
there was nothing I'd be good at.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.496
But then I realized that this is it.

06:11.622 --> 06:14.708
Lois, my penis belongs on stage.

06:14.791 --> 06:18.420
Wait, Peter, everyone has to audition.
You know, sing, dance.

06:18.545 --> 06:19.546
[Laughs]

06:19.630 --> 06:20.672
I get it.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.009
Hello, everybody.

06:24.092 --> 06:27.513
This is just a formality,
since I happen to be doing the director.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.139

want to thank everyone for auditioning.

07:06.802 --> 07:09.137
-You were all great.
-Weren't they?

07:09.263 --> 07:11.890
I only wish the show was called
The King and Us...

it wasn't actually her.

To hell with you!

and go directly to films!

I'm not "The King."

I'm not "I," I'm not anybody.

-So, what? I had sex with you for nothing?
-No, Peter, I...

08:25.589 --> 08:28.800
It's just that directing this show
is a big opportunity for me...

-Yes.

11:16.468 --> 11:19.429
Our top story tonight.
I will be playing the role of Anna...

11:19.513 --> 11:22.266
...in the Quahog Players production
of The King and I.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.559
-Tom?
-Thanks, Diane.

11:23.642 --> 11:27.145
In other news, I'm not going to the play
because I'm sure it'll be lousy.

11:27.229 --> 11:30.357
I'm getting late word
that you're a petty, jealous, closet case.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.902
Bit of breaking news. We now go live
to Diane being a bitch. Diane?

11:34.862 --> 11:38.073
But Loretta's playing Anna,
and she's doing a great job.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.951
Loretta's a nobody.
Diane Simmons is a star.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.078
You wanted me to sell tickets, right?

11:43.203 --> 11:46.748
People who've never been in a theater
will come see Diane Simmons.

11:46.832 --> 11:49.459
I don't know, Peter,
she's a news reporter.

11:49.543 --> 11:52.963
Some of our greatest actors
started in news, like Sean Penn.

11:53.046 --> 11:57.676
Today's weather calls for breezy skies
and sun, and there's gonna be a...

11:58.177 --> 12:00.095
Get that camera out of my face!

12:03.765 --> 12:05.976
PETER: Hey, everybody, here's our star!

12:06.101 --> 12:07.352
This is so awkward.

12:07.436 --> 12:10.189
You all know my name,
and I've never heard of any of you.

12:10.272 --> 12:13.817
-You ever acted before, honey?
-I did an independent film in college.

12:21.533 --> 12:24.494
[Melancholic instrumental music]

12:42.804 --> 12:46.808
LOIS: Let's start with the scene where
Lady Thiang begs Anna to comfort the king.

12:47.434 --> 12:51.522
-Are you playing Lady Thiang?
-I was supposed to be Anna.

12:51.980 --> 12:55.734
They did an all-you-people version
of Hello, Dolly that was very successful.

12:55.817 --> 12:58.654
Okay, let's go from the top of Scene 7.

12:58.862 --> 12:59.905
Action!

12:59.988 --> 13:04.159
"Oh, Mrs. Anna, the king needs you.
You must go to him.

13:04.535 --> 13:09.498

truly needs me, I will go to him."

13:09.581 --> 13:11.166
Cut! All wrong! No good!

13:11.250 --> 13:13.460
Peter, what are you doing?
She was wonderful.

13:13.544 --> 13:14.545
My ass.

13:14.628 --> 13:16.213
Besides, I'm the director.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.215
It just doesn't feel real, you know?

13:18.298 --> 13:20.759
Anna and Miss Thing both love
the king, right?

13:20.843 --> 13:23.679
On Springer yesterday,
they had "I won't share my husband"...

13:23.762 --> 13:27.057
...and these two women bitch-slapped
each other. The crowd went nuts.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.767
Loretta, why don't you try slapping Diane?

13:28.851 --> 13:30.310
I think I can do that.

13:30.394 --> 13:33.021
Wait a minute.
Nobody's slapping anybody.

13:33.105 --> 13:36.233
This is Rodgers and Hammerstein,
not trash TV!

13:36.316 --> 13:38.485
I think Peter may be onto something.

13:38.569 --> 13:41.196
Springer is one of our station's
highest-rated shows.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.241
-I don't know.
-I thought you wanted to do a good show?

13:44.324 --> 13:47.202
If you want to do a bad show,
why don't we just do Rent?

13:47.411 --> 13:49.663
I guess we can try that--
-Action!

13:50.998 --> 13:54.835
Come on, Lois. Those hoop skirts
make Diane look a little hippie, you know?

13:54.918 --> 13:58.088
I thought we could dress her
in a pair of sequined capri pants.

13:58.172 --> 14:01.258
They didn't have capri pants in the 1860s.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.135
They did now!

14:03.218 --> 14:06.555
STEWIE: You! You are the worst thing
to happen to musical theater...

14:06.638 --> 14:08.307
...since Andrew Lloyd Webber!

14:08.682 --> 14:11.935

to discuss my latest changes.

14:20.527 --> 14:21.820
What changes?

14:22.196 --> 14:25.449
The Siamese children. How about this?
They're not children.

They're aliens!

14:27.826 --> 14:30.037
QUAGMIRE: That was great.
BRIAN: On the money.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.622
Isn't he brilliant?

14:31.705 --> 14:35.626
No! He's not brilliant!
Rodgers and Hammerstein were brilliant!

14:35.709 --> 14:40.214
And I want to do the show they wrote!
We're not making any more changes!

14:40.297 --> 14:41.381
MEG: We sold out!

14:41.465 --> 14:44.259
Yeah. The whole town's talking
about your show, Dad!

14:44.384 --> 14:45.594

14:45.719 --> 14:48.013
Your show? Peter, this is my show!

14:48.096 --> 14:50.724
What's the big deal?
You wanted to sell out, and we did.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.267
I am through selling out.

14:52.351 --> 14:55.479
I took this job because
I wanted to create something beautiful...

14:55.562 --> 14:57.314
...and you've completely destroyed that!

14:57.397 --> 15:00.192
You want to be the director? Fine! I quit!

15:01.276 --> 15:02.653
Me, direct?

15:03.028 --> 15:06.073
I don't know what to say, except,
"I'm the king of the..."

15:11.787 --> 15:14.790
Good morning, Peter.
I made your favorite breakfast.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.001
-What the hell is this?
-French toast.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.963
I just made a few creative changes
to the recipe.

15:21.046 --> 15:22.881
I think it's a lot better now.

15:23.048 --> 15:26.093
Lois, if this is your idea of a joke,
you must write for Leno.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.763
It is so fashionable to take a shot
at Jay Leno.

15:29.847 --> 15:34.101
Look, the fact is the man is out there
every bloody night with fresh material...

15:34.184 --> 15:35.477
...and he's charming.

15:35.561 --> 15:39.314
Face it, you're just jealous because
people like my ideas better than yours.

15:39.398 --> 15:41.817
I don't care
if the whole world loves your ideas.

15:41.900 --> 15:45.279
That doesn't make them good.
I was trying to make art.

-What about "daisy"?
-"Chrysanthemum"!

15:59.835 --> 16:02.880
-"Iris," "rose"? What about "rose"?
-Did you say "rose"?

16:02.963 --> 16:04.590
-Yeah, "rose."
-"Rose" is good!

16:04.673 --> 16:07.551
-"A rose by any other name." That works.
-I like that a lot.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.553
-Moving on.
-What about "tulip"?

16:09.636 --> 16:11.096
"Rose" is fine. Moving on.

16:11.180 --> 16:13.891
Peter, you've never done a creative thing
in your life!

That's not true.
I wrote Bonfire of the Vanities.

No, you didn't.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.940
You win this round, Lois.

16:22.024 --> 16:25.569
You're not being creative.
You're just destroying a wonderful show.

16:25.652 --> 16:30.532
I have more creativity in my whole body
than most people do before 9:00 a.m.

16:30.616 --> 16:32.826
The only thing you create
before 9:00 a.m...

16:32.910 --> 16:35.204
...is exactly what you've turned
my show into.

a steel-town girl on a Saturday night...

16:54.306 --> 16:56.266
...looking for the fight of her life.

but we open this show in three hours...

You keep changing everything!

17:20.666 --> 17:22.918
You bet I do! Because theater is alive.
