00:45.694 --> 00:50.457
Project Connection: A planetary operation
to build two machines in our planet's orbit.

00:50.567 --> 00:53.232
Known simple as Machine I and Machine II.

00:56.772 --> 01:01.822
Objective: To form a link with the nearest
planet believed to have intelligent life.

01:07.790 --> 01:08.979
The mission:

01:09.089 --> 01:13.670
60 years ago Machine II was sent across
our galaxy towards the chosen planet.

01:18.985 --> 01:23.390
The unmanned voyage across 20 light years
of space was completely autonomous.

01:27.375 --> 01:31.240
Once Machine II arrives in orbit
the machines will connect...

01:31.350 --> 01:34.739
...enabling instant transport
between the two planets.

01:37.443 --> 01:39.973
Today is connection day.

01:42.698 --> 01:47.887
Flight A: An unmanned probe successfully
tested the connection and gathered basic data.

01:53.221 --> 01:54.340
Flight B:

01:54.450 --> 01:59.406
Next a manned mission will orbit the planet
twice and reconnoiter before returning.

02:24.305 --> 02:26.628
<i>We are just checking the last data packet.</i>

02:30.495 --> 02:34.693
<i>We've confirmed those trajectories,
we just have one more maneuver to issue.</i>

02:39.909 --> 02:46.380
<i>Recommending one more correction
of 24.0 and 3.5 degrees.</i>

02:47.648 --> 02:49.219
Confirmed.

02:50.396 --> 02:55.269
Twenty-four degrees
positive pitch plus red 3.5.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.942
<i>Correct.</i>

03:02.402 --> 03:04.885
<i>Okay, begin burn on my count.</i>

03:06.164 --> 03:09.954
<i>On five, four, ignition ready...</i>

03:10.064 --> 03:13.160
<i>...two, one, begin.</i>

03:13.270 --> 03:14.874
Burning.

03:15.233 --> 03:17.258
Eighty-six...

03:18.149 --> 03:19.822
...87...

03:21.577 --> 03:23.458
...89...

03:24.985 --> 03:26.932
...93...

03:27.881 --> 03:29.855
...97...

03:30.915 --> 03:32.863
...101...

03:34.225 --> 03:35.823
...105...

03:36.870 --> 03:38.754
...107...

03:39.943 --> 03:41.839
...109...

03:51.672 --> 03:55.856
<i>Great, we can confirm
you have a lock with entrance.</i>

03:59.517 --> 04:03.777
<i>Ten second countdown to machine
engagement on my mark.</i>

04:04.123 --> 04:05.601
<i>Mark.</i>

04:06.312 --> 04:09.308
<i>Eight, seven...</i>

04:09.418 --> 04:12.352
<i>...six, five...</i>

04:12.462 --> 04:15.223
<i>...four, three...</i>

04:15.786 --> 04:18.779
<i>...two, one.</i>

04:28.213 --> 04:30.377
What's happening, is there a problem?

04:32.431 --> 04:34.504
Is there a problem?

04:34.614 --> 04:39.237
<i>Negative, the link is being confirmed,
and we are clear for transit.</i>

04:41.412 --> 04:45.402
<i>Okay, we have received your final package
and cleared you for control.</i>

04:45.512 --> 04:47.488
<i>Launch when ready.</i>

18:34.305 --> 18:36.230
Captain James to Com 1.

18:36.340 --> 18:39.737
First transmission from E581.

18:39.847 --> 18:44.042
<i>There was a problem on arrival
and I've crash-landed on the planet.</i>

18:44.152 --> 18:48.137
<i>From what I've seen so far,
it isn't what we expected...</i>

18:48.408 --> 18:51.989
<i>...it's barren and there's no sign
of intelligent life.</i>

18:52.281 --> 18:56.889
<i>I have enough food and water
to last me five days.</i>

18:56.999 --> 19:02.703
<i>With the communications delay, I expect
to hear from you within three hours.</i>

20:06.990 --> 20:08.594
Shit!

20:18.065 --> 20:19.962
Fucking hell!

20:23.317 --> 20:24.800
For...

21:24.712 --> 21:27.303
Come on, where are you?

21:57.258 --> 21:59.751
<i>Captain James to Com 1.</i>

21:59.861 --> 22:03.218
<i>I've been on E581 now for almost 24 hours...</i>

22:03.740 --> 22:06.973
<i>...and I've still had
no communications from you.</i>

22:08.337 --> 22:10.870
<i>Hopefully, it's a problem
with my equipment...</i>

22:10.980 --> 22:13.512
<i>...and you've already
got a rescue on the way.</i>

22:14.952 --> 22:17.346
<i>I have lost my water supply...</i>

22:17.456 --> 22:19.919
<i>...so today I have to find another source...</i>

22:20.029 --> 22:22.552
<i>...or there will be no one to rescue.</i>

22:22.969 --> 22:25.804
<i>I will continue to send my reports.</i>

22:40.519 --> 22:41.995
Water.

27:06.811 --> 27:08.711
They're hunting.

27:23.814 --> 27:25.348
Shit.

31:06.894 --> 31:09.050
No one's coming for me.

31:28.206 --> 31:30.173
James to Com 1.

31:31.242 --> 31:33.920
Things are looking a bit desperate down here.

31:34.796 --> 31:38.145
I've had no contact from you,
and I'm down to three rations.

31:38.771 --> 31:41.401
<i>I've had to start thinking
about a backup plan.</i>

31:41.511 --> 31:44.369
<i>I have seen that there is
intelligent life here...</i>

31:44.479 --> 31:46.245
<i>...and they have machines.</i>

31:46.355 --> 31:51.165
<i>And if they have machines, then maybe
they can get me back into orbit.</i>

31:51.582 --> 31:55.353
<i>Right now they're my only hope
of getting home.</i>

43:03.277 --> 43:05.813
I get it, you want this.

45:15.960 --> 45:18.267
Captain James to Com 1.

45:20.876 --> 45:25.051
I've found something,
some kind of a container.

45:25.886 --> 45:29.851
The entire thing is
covered in alien language.

50:22.169 --> 50:24.342
They moved underground.

52:34.609 --> 52:36.710
We need to find your owners.

53:19.100 --> 53:21.036
Where the fuck are you going?

53:26.176 --> 53:28.099
He's going home.

54:12.823 --> 54:15.190
<i>Captain James to Com 1.</i>

54:15.816 --> 54:20.297
<i>The surface of this planet has suffered
from a devastating war.</i>

54:20.818 --> 54:24.350
<i>I believe the machines
are serving their creators...</i>

54:24.460 --> 54:27.250
<i>...who are sheltering beneath the surface.</i>

54:28.661 --> 54:31.351
<i>I hope soon to make contact...</i>

54:31.461 --> 54:33.376
<i>...and with a little luck...</i>

54:33.486 --> 54:38.374
<i>...make use of them and their
technology to get me home.</i>

55:32.691 --> 55:35.058
Let's see where you're going to take me.

56:45.186 --> 56:47.102
Why have we stopped?

56:47.212 --> 56:49.114
Are we here?

56:52.338 --> 56:54.235
Nah, this ain't it.

58:10.670 --> 58:14.300
Get in here! Get in here now!

58:21.661 --> 58:23.223
Fuck!

58:39.638 --> 58:41.495
Damn it!

58:48.701 --> 58:50.630
Come on!

01:00:51.901 --> 01:00:53.627
Trapped.

01:11:19.241 --> 01:11:21.530
<i>Com 1 to Captain James.</i>

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:23.820
<i>We have received your transmissions...</i>

01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:26.151
<i>...but we are having communication issues...</i>

01:11:26.261 --> 01:11:30.680
<i>...it appears the Machine insertion
orbit is highly irregular...</i>

01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:33.523
<i>...and we are having trouble locking on.</i>

01:11:33.633 --> 01:11:37.083
<i>We would like to get you
back up there as soon as possible.</i>

01:11:38.289 --> 01:11:40.453
<i>Is your situation still the same?</i>

01:11:43.263 --> 01:11:44.957
<i>We are not able to send a rescue party...</i>

01:11:45.067 --> 01:11:47.866
<i>...until we can determine
the cause of the problems.</i>

01:11:49.210 --> 01:11:51.172
<i>Hang in there.</i>

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:31.808
<i>Attention.</i>

01:12:31.918 --> 01:12:35.049
<i>Automatic systems override.</i>

01:12:41.455 --> 01:12:45.390
<i>Warning. Chemical weapon detected.</i>

01:12:48.579 --> 01:12:50.216
<i>Attention.</i>

01:12:50.326 --> 01:12:53.337
<i>Automatic systems override.</i>

01:13:12.762 --> 01:13:14.667
They're all dead.

01:13:22.545 --> 01:13:24.709
How do I get home now?

01:13:25.987 --> 01:13:27.801
What did you do?

01:13:28.562 --> 01:13:30.692
What did you do?

01:13:56.954 --> 01:13:58.536
Why?

01:13:59.013 --> 01:14:00.589
Why?

01:14:01.455 --> 01:14:03.393
Why did you do it?

01:14:12.688 --> 01:14:14.631
<i>Com 1 to Captain James.</i>

01:14:15.257 --> 01:14:19.084
<i>One other thing, it seems that
there was a big calculation error...</i>

01:14:19.194 --> 01:14:23.278
<i>...at our end which means
the machine arrived much too early.</i>

01:14:26.083 --> 01:14:29.093
<i>It's been there for five solar orbits.</i>

01:14:45.972 --> 01:14:47.508
No.

01:14:48.719 --> 01:14:50.634
You had it all wrong.

01:16:19.455 --> 01:16:23.033
It can't be, you're kidding me.

01:17:33.786 --> 01:17:35.929
I've just got to get on.

01:17:41.444 --> 01:17:43.533
There's no going back now.
