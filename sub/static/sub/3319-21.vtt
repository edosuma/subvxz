00:02.872 --> 00:03.873
Previously onMom...Do you remember Bonnie Plunkett?

00:03.960 --> 00:05.135
Bonnie.

00:05.222 --> 00:06.745
I'm her daughter.

00:06.832 --> 00:08.443
Oh, my God.

00:08.530 --> 00:09.487
I'm your daughter.

00:09.574 --> 00:12.316
Yeah, yeah, I got that.

00:12.403 --> 00:14.840
So, did Christy tell you
about meeting her father?

00:14.927 --> 00:17.191
Yeah, I thought it was great
they reconnected.

00:17.278 --> 00:18.888
Wow. Anything to hurt me.

00:18.975 --> 00:21.543
What are you talking about?

00:21.630 --> 00:23.501
Do I need to walk you
through it again?

00:23.588 --> 00:26.548
That rat bastard dumped me and
Christy the minute she was born.

00:26.635 --> 00:27.549
No, I get it.

00:27.636 --> 00:28.941
You're angry.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.900
"Angry"?
I want to cut the son of a bitch

00:30.987 --> 00:33.294
from throat to scrote.

00:33.381 --> 00:34.251
What do you think?

00:34.338 --> 00:35.992
What do I think of what?

00:36.079 --> 00:37.254
Your new car.

00:37.341 --> 00:38.690
You're kidding me.

00:38.777 --> 00:40.605
No, no. I got it
at a police auction.

00:40.692 --> 00:41.693
Cleaned it up.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.130
Look at that door.

00:43.217 --> 00:44.696
You can't even see
the bullet holes.

00:44.783 --> 00:45.915
Listen, I decided I don't want
to have a party.

00:46.002 --> 00:48.744
What are you talking about?

00:48.831 --> 00:50.441
It's a celebration.

00:50.528 --> 00:53.314
It's fun and games
and free stuff for the baby.

00:53.401 --> 00:54.228
I don't need it.

00:54.315 --> 00:55.577
Okay.

00:55.664 --> 00:57.100
May I ask why?

00:57.187 --> 01:00.364
I decided to give
the baby up for adoption.

01:00.451 --> 01:02.627
I'm kind of liking these people.

01:02.714 --> 01:05.325
Jeff and Suzanne Taylor.

01:05.413 --> 01:06.675
BONNIE: So...

01:06.762 --> 01:08.633
You want to adopt a baby?

01:08.720 --> 01:10.157
Yes, we do.

01:10.244 --> 01:11.071
You're in luck! We have one.

01:19.035 --> 01:20.950
Wow.

01:21.037 --> 01:23.866
When did gay men start
designing maternity clothes?

01:23.953 --> 01:26.129
Did you ever have a
reason to wear sequins

01:26.216 --> 01:28.653
while you were pregnant?

01:28.740 --> 01:31.787
Mmm, not after I was
too big to pole dance.

01:33.310 --> 01:34.877
I still remember
the night I slid down

01:34.964 --> 01:36.183
and couldn't get back up.

01:36.270 --> 01:38.359
Seriously?

01:38.446 --> 01:40.448
I was like a turtle on its back.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.843
How you doing
in there, Violet?

01:44.930 --> 01:47.063
I hate my body
and I hate this dress.

01:47.150 --> 01:49.152
Oh, come on,
it can't be that bad.

01:49.239 --> 01:50.110
Whoa!

01:52.460 --> 01:53.417
Yikes.

01:53.504 --> 01:54.723
That's an interesting place

01:54.810 --> 01:56.246
to put a bow
on a pregnant girl.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.422
Oh, God, there's one
on her ass, too.

01:58.509 --> 01:59.945
Who am I kidding?

02:00.032 --> 02:01.121
I can't go to prom.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.123
Oh, honey, you got to go.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.254
It's such a big night.

02:04.341 --> 02:05.603
I look ridiculous.

02:05.690 --> 02:06.735
Not all of you.

02:06.822 --> 02:08.780
Just the middle.

02:10.390 --> 02:12.306
I don't care. I'm not going.

02:12.393 --> 02:14.917
All right, well,
it's your call.

02:15.004 --> 02:16.788
You can just stay home
with Grandma and me.

02:16.875 --> 02:18.573
That would be fun.
We can hang out, get a pizza.

02:18.660 --> 02:19.965
Maybe play a board game?

02:20.052 --> 02:21.402
Give each other pedicures?

02:21.489 --> 02:22.577
Turn off the lights and
tell ghost stories.

02:22.664 --> 02:24.013
We traced the call.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.362
It's coming from inside
the house!

02:25.449 --> 02:28.322
[both gasp]

02:28.409 --> 02:30.585
Screw it. There's got

02:30.672 --> 02:33.196
to be a dress
around here somewhere.

02:33.283 --> 02:35.155
Actually sounds
like a fun night.

02:35.242 --> 02:36.243
I know.

02:36.330 --> 02:37.244
What happened to us?

02:37.331 --> 02:38.288
[sighs]

02:56.045 --> 02:57.699
What a treat.

02:57.786 --> 03:00.180
Having a cup of coffee
with my mom and my dad.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.878
Blech!

03:02.965 --> 03:04.662
Can't you just fake it?

03:04.749 --> 03:05.533
She knows how.

03:09.667 --> 03:12.366
And whose fault is that?

03:12.453 --> 03:14.411
Play nice.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.848
And ew.

03:16.935 --> 03:18.589
So...

03:18.676 --> 03:20.678
how are things going
with you and Loraine?

03:20.765 --> 03:21.853
Not good.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.203
She filed for divorce.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.900
Really?

03:24.987 --> 03:26.467
There's not a chance you
could work things out?

03:26.554 --> 03:27.555
I went back to the house
last Saturday to see

03:27.642 --> 03:30.297
if we could reconcile and...

03:30.384 --> 03:32.864
a man I don't know
answered the door

03:32.951 --> 03:33.648
in my pajamas.

03:36.172 --> 03:38.348
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.482
Mom!

03:41.569 --> 03:42.918
Stop smiling.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.267
Oh, let me have this.

03:46.051 --> 03:47.488
Anyway, turns out they were
high school sweethearts.

03:47.575 --> 03:49.533
Found each other online.

03:49.620 --> 03:54.103
Tweeted their way back
into each other's pants.

03:54.190 --> 03:56.366
Wow.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.716
That has got to be so painful.

04:01.806 --> 04:02.677
Mom! The smile?

04:02.764 --> 04:05.593
I didn't even realize it.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.551
The good news is with the boys
grown up and gone,

04:07.638 --> 04:09.771
I have no reason to be in Chico,

04:09.858 --> 04:11.860
so I can spend more time
with you and the kids.

04:13.078 --> 04:13.688
Not smiling now, are you?

04:17.344 --> 04:18.736
Hey.Hey!

04:18.822 --> 04:20.695
Your mom tells me
you got a prom coming up.

04:20.781 --> 04:21.738
Mm-hmm.

04:21.826 --> 04:22.827
That sounds like fun.

04:22.914 --> 04:23.828
Yeah.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.395
What's the theme?

04:25.482 --> 04:28.398
"Broken condoms, broken dreams."

04:28.485 --> 04:30.574
Ah, okay.

04:30.661 --> 04:32.446
Well, you got a shot
at being the queen.

04:33.882 --> 04:35.449
Ha!

04:35.536 --> 04:37.146
Hang on.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.366
When my sons went to prom,
I rented them limos.

04:39.453 --> 04:40.671
How about I do the same
for you and your fella?

04:40.758 --> 04:44.458
Really?Yeah, you got to do prom right.

04:44.545 --> 04:46.155
Wow. Thank you.

04:46.242 --> 04:48.418
You're welcome.

04:48.505 --> 04:50.551
I'll go call my fella.

04:52.466 --> 04:53.902
I got a hug.

04:53.989 --> 04:54.729
The iceberg is melting.

04:54.816 --> 04:57.906
You sicken me.

04:57.993 --> 04:59.473
What did I do?Don't be coy.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.866
You're using money
to buy her affection.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.390
And it's working.

05:04.739 --> 05:05.783
Why don't you try
earning her love

05:05.870 --> 05:08.482
by being there, like I have?

05:08.569 --> 05:11.267
You're kidding, right?

05:11.354 --> 05:14.662
You only beat him by,
like, nine months.

05:14.749 --> 05:16.577
Pick a side.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.013
You got to pick a side.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.885
Bonnie, I'm just trying to do

05:20.972 --> 05:22.365
a nice thing
for my granddaughter.

05:22.452 --> 05:24.280
Well, quit it.
You don't get to drop

05:24.367 --> 05:26.587
into our lives after all these
years and make people happy.

05:26.674 --> 05:30.373
Are you listening to yourself?

05:30.460 --> 05:33.637
She never listens to herself.

05:33.724 --> 05:35.465
What's wrong with me
throwing a little money around

05:35.552 --> 05:36.597
to help out here?

05:36.684 --> 05:38.425
Nothing at all.

05:38.512 --> 05:41.776
FYI: Sears is having
a sale on dishwashers.

05:41.863 --> 05:44.735
Anything to make
your life better, baby.

05:44.822 --> 05:46.258
You're an evil runt.

05:47.869 --> 05:49.827
Alvin, stop smiling.

05:54.179 --> 05:55.398
Smile.

05:58.270 --> 05:58.706
Here you go.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.622
I don't get it.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.537
It's blank.Yeah, give it a minute.

06:03.624 --> 06:04.973
[gasps]

06:05.060 --> 06:06.540
It's like magic.

06:06.627 --> 06:07.802
Told ya.

06:07.889 --> 06:09.151
Is it a phone, too?

06:10.674 --> 06:11.762
Yeah, give it a try.

06:11.849 --> 06:15.287
[knocking on door]

06:15.375 --> 06:18.421
Call Dad.

06:20.684 --> 06:22.991
Yolo.

06:23.078 --> 06:25.167
Wow.
Right?

06:25.254 --> 06:26.734
And check out the limo
Violet's grandpa got us.

06:26.821 --> 06:29.519
Uh-huh.The guy's got class.

06:29.606 --> 06:31.739
The guy's got syphilis.

06:31.826 --> 06:32.740
Mom...

06:32.827 --> 06:34.132
you can call him names,

06:34.219 --> 06:35.482
but you can't make stuff up.

06:35.569 --> 06:38.746
Come on in, I'll
get your date.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.575
I said, "Call Dad."

06:42.663 --> 06:44.186
No idea.

06:46.057 --> 06:47.058
Violet, Luke's here.

06:47.145 --> 06:49.147
VIOLET:
I'm not going!

06:49.234 --> 06:51.193
Very funny.
Come on, he's waiting.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.151
And he rented a tux.

06:56.677 --> 06:58.113
Tell him to go
without me.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.636
Do you want me to talk to her?

06:59.723 --> 07:00.681
No, I'm her mother.

07:00.768 --> 07:01.769
I got this.

07:01.856 --> 07:04.336
Open the damn door, Violet!

07:04.424 --> 07:06.164
No!

07:06.251 --> 07:07.427
Hey, I'll handle this.

07:10.299 --> 07:12.257
Violet, it's me, Luke.

07:12.344 --> 07:14.999
I brought you flowers
and the limo has Diet Snapple.

07:15.086 --> 07:16.261
Go away!

07:16.348 --> 07:17.785
Tapping out.

07:17.872 --> 07:21.005
Is something wrong
with the dress?

07:21.092 --> 07:24.052
Something's wrong
with my life!

07:24.139 --> 07:25.967
There's something wrong
with all of our lives, honey.

07:26.054 --> 07:29.579
But we still go to parties
we bought expensive dresses for.

07:29.666 --> 07:30.841
Leave me alone!

07:30.928 --> 07:31.842
Let me try.

07:31.929 --> 07:34.845
Violet, it's Grandma.

07:34.932 --> 07:37.805
I-I just want you to know
that whatever you decide,

07:37.892 --> 07:40.460
I will be here for you
with the one thing

07:40.547 --> 07:42.984
your grandfather's
money can't buy.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.594
Love.

07:44.681 --> 07:46.466
You think that helped?

07:46.553 --> 07:48.511
It helped me.

07:52.341 --> 07:52.994
[knocking on window]

07:53.081 --> 07:55.083
Guess who?

07:56.563 --> 07:58.434
What is wrong with you?

08:02.569 --> 08:04.222
You really should lock this.

08:04.309 --> 08:05.920
There could be weirdos
wandering around out here.

08:06.007 --> 08:09.314
There are weirdos wandering
around out there.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.360
What do you want?

08:11.447 --> 08:12.927
All right, listen--

08:13.014 --> 08:14.798
I know you're feeling
self-conscious

08:14.885 --> 08:17.105
about the way you look,
and you're afraid your friends

08:17.192 --> 08:19.107
are gonna make fun of you,
but so what?

08:19.194 --> 08:20.717
You've carried yourself
with dignity and grace

08:20.804 --> 08:23.328
the whole school year.

08:23.415 --> 08:25.113
And there's no reason
you should stop now.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.202
Mom, that's not why...No!

08:27.289 --> 08:28.986
You need to get dressed,
get in the limo with Luke,

08:29.073 --> 08:30.335
and go to that prom
with your head held high.

08:30.422 --> 08:32.033
Mom, I can't...You are a great girl!

08:32.120 --> 08:34.426
And there's nothing
to be ashamed of.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.428
I can't go to prom

08:36.515 --> 08:39.649
'cause I can't stop farting.

08:39.736 --> 08:40.736
Oh.

08:40.823 --> 08:43.000
[sniffs]

08:43.087 --> 08:45.742
That's what that is.

08:45.829 --> 08:49.703
All right, well,
we can fix this.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.008
How we doing in here?

08:51.095 --> 08:52.053
We need perfume
and Gas-X, stat.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.795
I'm on it.There.

08:54.882 --> 08:57.928
Is anything else bothering you?

08:58.015 --> 08:59.713
I guess not.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.497
Violet...

09:01.584 --> 09:03.934
I just feel like I don't have
a lot to celebrate.

09:04.021 --> 09:05.501
Are you kidding?

09:05.588 --> 09:07.721
You so do!

09:07.808 --> 09:09.853
You are gonna graduate
high school,

09:09.940 --> 09:10.985
which is not normally
something to brag about.

09:11.072 --> 09:14.075
But in this family, hurray!

09:14.162 --> 09:15.685
And then you're gonna
go to college.

09:15.772 --> 09:19.515
And after that have
a big, wonderful life.

09:19.602 --> 09:21.952
But I'm giving up
my baby to do it.

09:22.039 --> 09:23.911
Yeah.

09:23.998 --> 09:27.349
You are.

09:27.436 --> 09:28.785
But let's not forget

09:28.872 --> 09:30.918
that the Taylors are
a great couple.

09:31.005 --> 09:34.878
And that child's gonna have

17:47.979 --> 17:50.982
Oh, my God. You shot him?

17:51.070 --> 17:52.114
It was an accident.

17:52.201 --> 17:53.594
I was trying
to make him dance

17:53.681 --> 17:54.986
like in one of those
Old Westerns.

17:57.032 --> 17:59.165
You two are unbelievable.

17:59.252 --> 18:01.384
I'm surprised you were
able to stop fighting

18:01.471 --> 18:02.037
long enough to conceive me.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.039
We didn't.

18:04.126 --> 18:06.433
How does that work?

18:06.520 --> 18:07.825
How do you think?
It hurts a little.

18:09.131 --> 18:11.307
Alvin Biletnikoff?

18:11.394 --> 18:12.308
That's us.

18:12.395 --> 18:13.309
Uh, relatives?

18:13.396 --> 18:14.571
I'm his daughter.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.138
I'm undecided.

18:16.225 --> 18:17.574
Okay.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.228
Well, it was
a minor heart attack.

18:19.315 --> 18:20.838
He's out of danger,
but one of his arteries

18:20.925 --> 18:22.013
is 70% blocked,
so we're putting in a stent.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.624
So, he'll be okay?

18:23.711 --> 18:24.929
I should think so.
You'll probably be able

18:25.016 --> 18:26.105
to take him home tomorrow.

18:26.192 --> 18:27.932
Oh, thank God.
That's great news.

18:28.019 --> 18:30.109
For you.

18:31.806 --> 18:32.981
And he's going to need
to take it easy

18:33.068 --> 18:34.548
for a couple of weeks--

18:34.635 --> 18:36.115
is there somebody available
to provide care?

18:37.464 --> 18:39.683
What are you
looking at me for?

18:39.770 --> 18:42.077
I've got a full-time job

18:42.164 --> 18:43.513
and I'm gonna have
to deal with Violet.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.255
You cannot ask me
to take care of that man.

18:46.342 --> 18:48.431
I am not asking you.
I am telling you.

18:48.518 --> 18:50.390
No. I am not doing it!

18:50.477 --> 18:52.653
No, no, no!

18:57.005 --> 18:59.138
No!

19:01.531 --> 19:02.532
Oh, my God.

19:02.619 --> 19:03.968
She still loves him.

19:04.055 --> 19:07.624
You have no idea
how funny this is.

19:07.711 --> 19:09.060
[laughing]
