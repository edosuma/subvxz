00:02.127 --> 00:03.969
<i>My name is
Oliver Queen.</i>

00:04.171 --> 00:05.263
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:05.464 --> 00:08.764
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:09.218 --> 00:11.391
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

00:11.595 --> 00:13.973
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

00:14.181 --> 00:15.933
<i>But by night, I am someone else.</i>

00:16.099 --> 00:17.976
<i>I am something else.</i>

00:18.352 --> 00:20.446
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

00:21.772 --> 00:22.989
Previously on Arrow...

00:23.190 --> 00:24.487
Really sorry about this, Sergeant.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.451
You're not here to secure the trigger.
You're stealing it.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.245
You want to read your confession
before you sign it?

00:28.445 --> 00:31.790
- You did this.
- No one will ever believe your story.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.959
We call ourselves Helix.
We're calling the data cache "Pandora."

00:35.118 --> 00:37.246
With it, you can spark revolutions.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.586
So, you're not just
giving me the file for John?

00:39.915 --> 00:41.292
I've got all we need to exonerate John.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.423
- Well, how'd you do that?
- Long story.

00:46.338 --> 00:47.464
Pleased to meet you.

00:47.714 --> 00:51.810
I know exactly how this brotherhood works,
and right now, it works for me.

00:52.052 --> 00:57.434
Shipwrecked on Lian Yu, fled to Hong Kong,
and now, you're mixed up with the Bratva.

00:57.641 --> 01:01.191
The man who survived all this
is destined for so much more.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.730
You need to give the monster an identity.

01:03.939 --> 01:05.862
<i>It's only when the monster
becomes someone else,</i>

01:06.316 --> 01:09.365
<i>something else,
that you're free to be Oliver Queen.</i>

01:09.820 --> 01:10.912
I don't know if I'm ready.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.907
I will help you become ready.

01:23.041 --> 01:26.511
What are we doing here?
These are low-level drug dealers.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.426
They're target practice.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.436
Stop!

01:55.616 --> 01:57.084
You're beginning to understand now.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.543
Understand what?

01:58.910 --> 02:02.540
That the man who embraces the dark
is never without sight.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.128
Okay,
so is this the Orchid Bay facility

02:09.295 --> 02:10.422
or the Downtown rebuild?

02:10.672 --> 02:12.549
How long until the announcement?

02:12.758 --> 02:15.011
Don't you have a chief of staff
who usually handles this stuff?

02:15.218 --> 02:17.016
- Excuse us, please.
- Okay.

02:17.346 --> 02:19.724
Thea is looking into a few
joint initiatives that I proposed

02:19.931 --> 02:21.399
while in Hub City last week.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.737
Oh, that's really too bad. I've come to
look forward to her many looks of death.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.147
Thea likes you, she's just...

02:26.355 --> 02:28.449
It's okay, Oliver.
She's not the Queen I'm seeing.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.410
That's sort of an old-fashioned way
to say it, don't you think?

02:31.610 --> 02:33.453
Well, I'm not really sure
how else to put it

02:33.612 --> 02:35.330
given that we haven't progressed.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.412
A funny way of saying
we haven't slept together.

02:38.825 --> 02:39.917
Hi.

02:40.535 --> 02:44.961
Hi, Quentin,
I wasn't expecting to see you today.

02:45.207 --> 02:47.255
Well, you know,
that's the thing about rehab.

02:47.626 --> 02:49.344
<i>It's a long process, and then it ain't.</i>

02:49.544 --> 02:52.263
And by the looks of that assistant
out there, you need me back bad.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.262
- How about I give you guys a moment?
- Yeah.

02:54.466 --> 02:57.936
It's all right, Ms. Williams. I wasn't
planning on keeping my problems a secret.

02:59.054 --> 03:02.274
In fact, I wanted to talk with you
about them. You know, on camera.

03:02.474 --> 03:05.102
- I'll have my people set up an interview.
- Thank you.

03:05.894 --> 03:09.899
I believe you are running late
for a press conference, Mr. Mayor.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.870
- Oh, you live a complicated life.
- How are you?

03:16.113 --> 03:17.956
You know, I'm better
than I've been in a long while, thanks.

03:18.156 --> 03:21.000
That's fantastic to hear, but...
Look, maybe we shouldn't...

03:21.201 --> 03:23.295
What, push my luck
by sitting down with your new girlfriend?

03:23.453 --> 03:26.297
Well, no, just wait a little bit,
let Thea come back and prep you, and...

03:26.456 --> 03:29.005
Oliver, if I were any more dry,
I'd be dust, okay?

03:29.209 --> 03:32.463
I'm ready to move forward.
And this is how.

03:32.963 --> 03:36.217
Now, didn't Ms. Williams say you were late
for a press conference?

03:36.425 --> 03:37.426
Yep.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.853
I like to thank District Attorney Chase

03:40.262 --> 03:43.937
who stepped out of his lane
to represent my friend John Diggle

03:44.141 --> 03:45.984
<i>to make sure that justice was done.</i>

03:46.184 --> 03:50.405
Mr. Chase's efforts further exemplify
Star City takes care of their own.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.533
Thank you, everybody, that'll be all.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.486
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

03:56.653 --> 03:57.654
For getting me out.

03:57.863 --> 04:00.662
Thank whoever leaked the NSA's case
against Walker. My job was easy.

04:01.158 --> 04:02.705
Congratulations, Mr. Diggle.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.624
L was wondering if the DA
might have a second to chat?

04:05.829 --> 04:07.001
Save your energy, Ms. Williams,

04:07.247 --> 04:09.545
I know you're doing a story
on the death of Detective Malone.

04:09.750 --> 04:10.842
I have no comment for you.

04:11.042 --> 04:13.886
And yet everyone I spoke to
said you're the man to speak to.

04:14.296 --> 04:17.048
It's a little odd for a DA
to be so involved in a police matter.

04:17.339 --> 04:18.887
<i>The victim
was a member of the ACU.</i>

04:19.091 --> 04:22.687
That office is monitored by City Hall,
not by the SCPD.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.727
- Oh, my God.
- Not what you wanted to hear?

04:24.973 --> 04:27.351
Military police just took General Walker
into custody.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.445
Walker and his men
just shot their way off of Fort Zerillo.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.232
Thirty dead, and he and his men
are in the wind.

04:33.398 --> 04:36.117
And the nuke trigger he stole
in Chechnya is still missing.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.212
What can you tell us?

04:47.370 --> 04:49.213
Lots. But first, welcome back.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.337
- Hugs, kisses, warm feelings.
- Likewise.

04:51.541 --> 04:54.545
I just got word from Lyla that A.R.G.U.S.
discovered a batch of encrypted emails

04:54.711 --> 04:56.509
between Walker
and a group of Markovian separatists.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.636
He's looking to sell the nuke.
We can't let that happen.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.935
We have the US military and A.R.G.U.S.
hunting Walker.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.479
They can't go where it's going.
The sale's in Russia.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.264
This one's personal.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.898
I gotta take that murderous son of a bitch
off the grid right now, whatever it takes.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.443
City Hall gives me access
to a private plane.

05:13.647 --> 05:14.819
- I'm coming, too.
- Felicity...

05:15.023 --> 05:16.320
This is personal for me as well.

05:16.525 --> 05:19.244
I promised I'd never let
another Havenrock happen again

05:19.444 --> 05:22.072
as long as it was in my power,
and I believe that this qualifies.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.250
Walker will have his whole unit with him,
maybe even some Markovians.

05:25.534 --> 05:26.660
We need the whole team for this.

05:26.910 --> 05:30.460
Agreed, but Quentin just got out of rehab,
and with Thea out of town I...

05:31.164 --> 05:32.586
I need someone to keep an eye on him.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.380
Who'd you have in mind?

05:43.844 --> 05:46.643
Better be the report
on the Washington district water projects.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.231
Not exactly, hoss.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.775
- What are you... What?
- Why aren't you in your office?

05:51.268 --> 05:54.442
Well, I came in here to work 'cause
everyone's been dropping by my office

05:54.604 --> 05:56.106
asking how I am,
and I don't need the attention.

05:56.273 --> 05:57.775
And by the way, I just got off the phone
with Oliver

05:57.983 --> 05:59.951
who says he's on the way to Russia.
So what are you doing here?

06:00.151 --> 06:03.621
Oliver said I'm supposed to help you prep
for your interview with Susan Williams,

06:03.780 --> 06:06.875
and it was safer for me to be here
than over there

06:07.075 --> 06:08.622
starting an "international incident."

06:08.869 --> 06:10.837
Also, you need talk to your receptionist.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.790
She didn't believe I was here for you,
I had to sneak past her just to get in.

06:14.082 --> 06:16.130
I wonder how
she could've made that mistake.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.471
Listen, why don't you just do us
both a favor, all right?

06:20.672 --> 06:22.424
Just go home, polish your hockey mask
or something,

06:22.632 --> 06:25.431
and I'll just tell Oliver you were here
the whole time. That's cool, right?

06:25.677 --> 06:30.353
Sure. Except you're fresh out of rehab,
not a politician, about to face the media.

06:30.891 --> 06:34.771
- So, what's it hurt to have a little help?
- Oh, just my waking sanity.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.197
All right, well, pull up a chair.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.281
- Coffee?
- Sure.

06:49.868 --> 06:52.712
Okay, this whole flying private thing
is something I could really get used to.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.005
Being Mayor has its perks.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.503
You're lucky that Star City's
"sister city" is in Russia.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.176
As of 12 hours ago, at least.

06:58.376 --> 06:59.377
You ready for this?

06:59.628 --> 07:00.629
When I signed on, I didn't think

07:00.879 --> 07:03.007
I'd be stopping a nuclear arms sale
in a foreign country.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.351
Yeah, when I signed on,
I didn't think I'd be dealing with aliens.

07:06.551 --> 07:07.768
- Aliens?
- Yeah.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.346
John said you had friends in Russia.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.306
One friend.
Reached out, didn't hear back...

07:11.514 --> 07:13.687
- Oliver Queen!
- Anatoly!

07:16.645 --> 07:18.864
You never should have come back to Russia.

07:24.861 --> 07:28.491
- Anatoly?
- Alexi Leonov. You remember him, yes?

07:28.949 --> 07:30.872
- He was one of your brothers.
- I can explain.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.539
You asked favor of him.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.881
He asked favor in return,
and you pulled gun on him instead?

07:37.123 --> 07:40.093
You know why I can't be some Bratva thug.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.467
You made promise. You swore oath.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.558
And now one of your brothers is dead.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.015
So why should I welcome you as brother?

07:51.388 --> 07:54.733
Go home, Oliver.
There's nothing for you here.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.493
Ugh. Feel like somebody died
of tuberculosis in here.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.832
What's the Russian word for creepy?

08:11.032 --> 08:12.284
<i>Zhutko.</i>

08:13.118 --> 08:16.418
I was studying on the plane.
Where did you find this place?

08:17.038 --> 08:18.085
Lyla.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.754
This used to be an A.R.G.U.S. safe house,

08:21.001 --> 08:23.379
but as you can tell
from Amero-Russian relations,

08:23.586 --> 08:25.463
- it hasn't been used much lately.
- Yeah, no kidding.

08:25.714 --> 08:27.887
Right.
And why aren't we working with A.R.G.U.S.?

08:28.091 --> 08:29.934
I assume preventing black market
nuclear deals

08:30.176 --> 08:31.393
would be pretty high on their to-do list.

08:31.594 --> 08:32.640
John's right about Russia.

08:32.886 --> 08:35.059
A.R.G.U.S. can't operate here
without causing a diplomatic crisis.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.934
Oh, yes, speaking of diplomatic crises,
why did your friend punch you?

08:38.268 --> 08:41.943
Three years ago, I used a Bratva contact
when I was trying to track Slade Wilson.

08:42.272 --> 08:46.743
He asked me for something in exchange,
I refused. Slade killed him.

08:49.237 --> 08:50.910
How long do you think
until we're up and running?

08:51.114 --> 08:52.957
I'm not sure. I'm pretty much
starting from scratch here,

08:53.158 --> 08:56.207
and I have to hack the Russian server to
see if we can find any chatter on Walker,

08:56.453 --> 08:58.751
and that might take no time,
or it might take, like, a lot of time.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.208
What about your Bratva friend
with the good right hook?

09:01.458 --> 09:02.459
You could try making nice.

09:02.625 --> 09:03.717
It's not that simple.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.089
Yeah, well, simple or not, Oliver,
we have to use every asset we've got.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.108
I made a mistake with Leonov.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.028
It was a challenging time.

09:31.446 --> 09:34.325
But you still owe me for Gregor.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.802
Lucky for you, I never liked Leonov. Sit.

09:47.504 --> 09:50.883
John Diggle, it's good to see you.
Now you my favorite American.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.342
Thanks.

09:52.801 --> 09:55.099
So, what brings you to Russia?

09:55.345 --> 09:57.643
We're looking for a US general
that has gone rogue.

09:57.847 --> 10:01.477
We have reason to believe he's trying
to sell a nuke to Markovian terrorists.

10:01.684 --> 10:02.936
What concern is that of yours?

10:03.186 --> 10:04.904
Are you gonna help me
find this man or not?

10:07.190 --> 10:09.488
After business with Leonov,

10:10.110 --> 10:13.364
just me sitting with you
squares us with Gregor, yes?

10:13.822 --> 10:15.916
Fine.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.534
Then, we are even.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.628
And back to how things work in Bratva.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.087
I help you, you help me.

10:22.330 --> 10:25.550
An arrangement you refused with Leonov,
if I'm not mistaken.

10:25.792 --> 10:30.764
An arrangement I'm going to refuse again.
That part of my life is over.

10:32.590 --> 10:33.887
Well, then I cannot help you.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.061
<i>But I can offer you some free advice.</i>

10:37.387 --> 10:39.060
Act quickly, Oliver.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.768
The Markovians do not,
as you Americans say,

10:43.184 --> 10:44.401
"Sit on their hands."

10:50.900 --> 10:52.243
You did well.

10:52.735 --> 10:55.079
You've proven to be a most adept student.

10:55.321 --> 10:58.450
I know a few teachers
who would disagree with that assessment.

11:00.118 --> 11:03.588
Hideo Yamane.
His name is in my father's notebook.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.124
<i>And for good reason.</i>

11:05.415 --> 11:07.417
Mr. Yamane's criminal enterprise
is responsible

11:07.625 --> 11:10.174
for much of the designer drug trade
in Starling City.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.843
<i>I think you'll recognize
his chief product?</i>

11:19.095 --> 11:23.191
My sister was using this,
so I killed her dealer.

11:24.934 --> 11:29.314
But I didn't consider the supply.
I left her, I left the city vulnerable.

11:29.564 --> 11:33.364
This is why I found you, Oliver.
So you can correct your mistakes.

11:34.152 --> 11:38.658
Now, Mr. Yamane is in town tonight
meeting with his Russian contacts.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.835
He's a careful man,
he'll be heavily guarded.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.248
- Am I ready?
- That's what we find out tonight.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.688
Sorry. I don't really have much control
beyond "on" and "off."

12:01.930 --> 12:04.900
Yeah, probably because you just produced
the sound of 1,000 Beyoncés?

12:05.141 --> 12:07.985
I mean, polyphonics doesn't even begin
to explain what you're doing.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.856
Can you guys please keep it down?

12:11.314 --> 12:12.611
Okay, Walker has gone completely dark.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.409
There is no way of pinpointing his IP
or his GPS from his phone,

12:15.652 --> 12:17.620
which is probably just a burner anyway.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.453
- That's good.
- How is that good?

12:20.698 --> 12:22.996
Military men
tend to be creatures of habit.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.292
If Walker's using a burner, odds are
it's the same model he used in the States.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.464
And the only one
making calls to the Markovians.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.684
Walker's flip phone of choice
is an old model.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.979
The only network here
that supports it is DetraLink DST.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.180
<i>Can you hack it?</i>

12:44.389 --> 12:46.232
I mean, I could,
but it would take a lot of time.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.934
I think I know someone
that could get us a shortcut.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.686
You have contacts in Russia, too?

12:49.978 --> 12:53.107
Well, kind of.
He might need a little bit of convincing.

12:53.398 --> 12:54.741
Think you two could look like Bratva?

13:08.496 --> 13:10.624
Sorry. I mean <i>prosti.</i>

13:13.042 --> 13:15.386
- I can't see a thing in these.
- Tough guys don't say sorry, Curtis.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.463
Right. No <i>prosti.</i>

13:17.672 --> 13:19.049
Guys, focus.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.051
Why isn't Dinah here with us?

13:22.218 --> 13:23.470
Look, I'm secure enough in my manhood

13:23.720 --> 13:26.439
to admit that she is way more intimidating
than either one of us.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.067
Yes, and a total unknown quantity.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.817
Look tough.

13:43.823 --> 13:48.294
Maxim Ostrovsky. You speak English.
I suggest you start using it.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.831
Who are you? What do you want?

13:51.164 --> 13:52.916
To talk in private.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.962
Don't make me ask you again.

14:07.430 --> 14:08.477
Who are you?

14:08.681 --> 14:11.400
Someone who needs access
to your system's credentials.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.103
You work for DetraLink.

14:13.519 --> 14:17.114
Not for long, I won't,
if I gave you my sign-in materials.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.611
Funny, you didn't seem worried
about losing your job

14:20.818 --> 14:24.448
when you ignored company policy to notify
the Kremlin about certain suspicious

14:24.697 --> 14:27.325
and terrorist-like activity
on your network last year.

14:27.575 --> 14:28.952
How do you know about that?

14:29.202 --> 14:31.921
Better question is, who would I tell?

14:33.373 --> 14:36.673
Because I am sure that the Kremlin
would love to hear about this.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.302
You can't.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.714
My family, they'll kill them.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.058
Yes.

14:46.636 --> 14:50.641
So I suggest it's in your best interest
to give me exactly what I want.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.240
Time to go.

15:00.483 --> 15:01.575
<i>Prosti.</i>

15:03.152 --> 15:04.779
That guy was seriously shaken.
What'd you say?

15:04.987 --> 15:05.988
What he needed to hear.

15:06.197 --> 15:08.199
I've got what we need
to get a location on Walker.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.552
Recon's in position.
I count 10 civilians in the church.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.599
No sign of Walker or his men.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.232
Backstop's also in position.
No activity here.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.694
Are we sure
this is the spot, Overwatch?

15:38.187 --> 15:40.440
Walker's phone just went active
from that address.

15:41.691 --> 15:42.783
There.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.703
John, there are civilians here.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.406
I don't care, Oliver,
this may be our only shot.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.120
We're moving on the target.
Everyone, stay sharp.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.215
Proximity alarm!

16:05.548 --> 16:06.765
Walker knew we were coming.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.718
Diggle, get down!

16:17.435 --> 16:19.608
- Are you guys hearing that?
- I'm guessing those aren't fireworks.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.359
Recon, get those civilians clear.
Backstop...

16:21.564 --> 16:22.861
<i>I'm coming in.</i>

16:27.111 --> 16:29.239
<i>I don't know
who you gentlemen are,</i>

16:29.530 --> 16:32.454
but I wanna thank you for
being so damn eager to find me.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.934
- You guys all right?
- Yeah, we're good.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.143
We lost Walker.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.229
- Overwatch, do you have eyes on?
<i>- Negative.</i>

16:57.433 --> 16:59.481
- All right, meet us out back.
- We've gotta find Walker.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.947
We have his man.
He'll take us right to him. Come on.

17:15.785 --> 17:18.584
What the hell is this?
There's no way you're A.R.G.U.S. or D.O.D.

17:18.788 --> 17:19.880
Shut up.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.420
Do whatever you want,
I'm not telling you anything.

17:22.625 --> 17:26.128
There are thousands,
maybe millions, of lives at stake.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.345
You don't want those deaths
on your conscience.

17:29.590 --> 17:33.515
My conscience? You gotta be kidding.
What's that?

17:33.928 --> 17:37.228
- This is your conscience.
- Stop!

17:37.473 --> 17:40.226
Nothing stops.
Nothing stops until you tell me

17:40.476 --> 17:42.729
when and where the buy is happening.

17:42.937 --> 17:47.488
Now you have five minutes to decide
what you want your face to look like.

17:54.615 --> 17:55.832
Oliver, you're just gonna leave him
in there?

17:56.075 --> 17:57.076
Just give it time.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.538
Oliver, we don't have time!
We have to get Walker now, right now!

17:59.704 --> 18:01.672
Let me in there, and I'll give him
all the persuasion he needs.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.175
He's gonna crack.
If you push him too hard right now,

18:04.375 --> 18:06.798
he'll tell you whatever you wanna hear
to get the pain to stop.

18:06.961 --> 18:09.760
We have to be smart, John, you know that.

18:22.476 --> 18:25.229
As much as I enjoy my visits
to Mother Russia,

18:25.521 --> 18:28.866
have you ever considered
relocating to Starling City?

18:37.325 --> 18:41.546
What do you want? Money? Drugs?
I'll give you anything.

18:42.872 --> 18:45.125
There's nothing you have that I want.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.376
Why, why are you doing this?

18:47.710 --> 18:51.305
Because you have failed Starling City.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.182
All right, I got transcripts
of past interviews

19:01.390 --> 19:04.189
Williams has done with alkies and addicts,
no offense.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.562
ls you being here
really necessary?

19:06.771 --> 19:09.069
Oliver wanted me to help you
prep for the interview.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.196
So how about some practice questions?

19:11.442 --> 19:13.444
All right, so you just got out of rehab.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.906
What makes you think you're still fit
to serve as deputy mayor?

19:16.113 --> 19:18.582
Well, that's a
very excellent question, Susan.

19:18.783 --> 19:21.036
- Ms. Williams.
- "Ms. Williams..."

19:21.494 --> 19:24.418
Well, I think
it's my dedication to this city.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.588
- I have lived here my whole life...
- So have lots of people.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.094
And I'm pretty sure not all of them
are recovering alcoholics.

19:30.336 --> 19:31.508
I think it's been
my ability to persevere...

19:31.754 --> 19:33.597
What are you persevering through?
Could you be more specific?

19:33.756 --> 19:36.100
Well, I'm trying to. Would you let me
get a word in edgewise, please?

19:36.300 --> 19:38.348
You think Susan Williams is gonna go
any easier?

19:39.428 --> 19:41.430
Now, when did the drinking begin?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.434
Was it before or after
the death of your daughter, Laurel?

19:46.727 --> 19:47.728
What'd you just say?

19:47.937 --> 19:49.610
Do you hold yourself
accountable for her death?

19:50.147 --> 19:51.444
Or for working with Damien Darhk?

19:51.732 --> 19:53.405
You shut your damn mouth
about my daughter!

19:53.651 --> 19:54.903
Dude, chill! I'm just trying to help.

19:55.111 --> 19:57.455
You're trying to help? Great.

19:57.905 --> 20:01.785
I'm gonna leave here and when I get back,
you don't be here.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.090
It's just me.

20:17.466 --> 20:20.310
You know you have
a workstation inside, right?

20:20.553 --> 20:22.976
Yeah, I wasn't having any luck
locating Walker,

20:23.139 --> 20:26.188
so I decided I'd work on my frustration
in private.

20:27.852 --> 20:28.853
What?

20:29.145 --> 20:31.273
The guy back in the teahouse,

20:32.440 --> 20:34.693
didn't look like someone
who owed you a favor.

20:35.401 --> 20:39.998
He was terrified.
Felicity, what's really going on?

20:42.324 --> 20:44.622
The NSA file that exonerated John.

20:45.870 --> 20:49.170
It was part of a cache of information
given to me by a hacker group,

20:49.373 --> 20:55.722
and that cache includes intel that I used
to pressure the DetraLink exec.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.719
You mean you blackmailed him.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.175
Well...

20:59.341 --> 21:04.598
For this data cache to have exactly
what you needed for this particular guy,

21:06.807 --> 21:08.104
it has to be huge.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.985
I think the term is "beyond massive."

21:13.189 --> 21:14.190
What?

21:14.356 --> 21:17.109
One of the last things my dad said to me

21:17.693 --> 21:19.036
when he gave me the rags,

21:20.571 --> 21:24.701
was that they hold a power most
people could never even imagine.

21:25.409 --> 21:30.040
And that I needed
to respect and guard that power,

21:31.957 --> 21:32.958
not abuse it.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.425
The people in this data cache,
they're not good people.

21:37.379 --> 21:40.724
I'm starting to believe that my purpose
on this Earth is to stop people like them,

21:40.883 --> 21:43.102
like Walker, no matter what the cost.

21:46.055 --> 21:48.023
And sometimes
you gotta fight fire with fire.

21:48.182 --> 21:51.937
I'm not worried about them,
I'm worried about you.

21:54.939 --> 21:56.782
I thought you were
working on locating Walker.

21:56.941 --> 21:57.988
Yeah.

21:59.610 --> 22:01.032
Is everything okay?

22:01.570 --> 22:06.326
This might be none of my business but
I think she crossed a line to find Walker.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.620
- Rory.
- What? What line?

22:10.996 --> 22:12.043
Stay here.

22:16.293 --> 22:17.419
Where's the buy happening?

22:17.586 --> 22:20.180
- Where's the buy happening?
- Hey, hey! John! That is enough!

22:20.589 --> 22:23.342
That's enough!
I thought we were doing this my way.

22:23.509 --> 22:27.980
Your way wasn't fast enough, Oliver.
I'm not letting Walker get away!

22:28.931 --> 22:30.604
- Neither am l.
- What's happening?

22:32.142 --> 22:34.611
- What happened?
- John got a little carried away.

22:35.813 --> 22:36.939
Did he say anything?

22:38.899 --> 22:39.900
No.

22:41.068 --> 22:44.447
You get yourself cleaned up. I'll be back.

22:44.613 --> 22:47.241
- Where you going?
- I'm going to handle this.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.085
- What do you need me to do?
- That did not take long.

22:57.251 --> 22:59.094
Anatoly, what do you want?

23:04.884 --> 23:08.434
To our imperfect union. <i>Vashe zdorovie.</i>

23:08.971 --> 23:10.393
<i>Vashe zdorovie.</i>

23:18.272 --> 23:19.273
Thanks.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.408
For coming as backup,
or for not telling anyone?

23:21.567 --> 23:22.614
Both.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.935
This isn't the first time
you've done something like this.

23:53.724 --> 23:54.771
ls it?

23:55.351 --> 23:58.571
- I don't mean as the Green Arrow...
- You mean as a thug, right?

24:01.023 --> 24:02.024
No.

24:03.651 --> 24:05.904
It's a part of my life that
I thought that I had moved past, but...

24:07.529 --> 24:08.530
Here we are.

24:09.531 --> 24:10.578
Right.

24:12.576 --> 24:14.578
You know, the other guys said
when you get in one of your moods,

24:14.745 --> 24:17.874
I should just let you be,
but, to be honest, brooding

24:18.874 --> 24:20.251
really kinda gets on my nerves.

24:20.709 --> 24:23.553
They told you about me.
They tell you about Prometheus?

24:23.712 --> 24:24.964
Yeah, they did.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.598
What... Why? Is this mood

24:26.757 --> 24:28.885
because you got pulled back
into some Bratva drama?

24:29.051 --> 24:30.052
No, it...

24:32.388 --> 24:33.685
That I'm trying to move forward...

24:36.225 --> 24:39.900
But I'm back here, I'm in Russia,
in the Bratva.

24:40.062 --> 24:43.191
And it just proves to me
I can't seem to do that.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.404
Prometheus got in your head.

24:48.570 --> 24:51.323
What was it, some crap about
infecting the people closest to you?

24:51.490 --> 24:53.834
Yeah, and tonight
I watched John torture a man.

24:55.244 --> 24:57.918
And there is something
going on with Felicity. There's...

24:59.331 --> 25:01.333
You affect the
people in your life, Oliver,

25:01.500 --> 25:03.798
that's hardly a revelatory observation.

25:04.253 --> 25:07.928
Yeah, in fact, I...
I think it's, uh... It's called living.

25:08.674 --> 25:11.427
Prometheus has you so
fixated on what's wrong with you,

25:11.760 --> 25:13.512
you've completely
stopped seeing what's right.

25:14.471 --> 25:17.270
You know, John and Felicity,
they'll listen to you

25:18.642 --> 25:22.692
because you have
more to offer than just this.

25:26.650 --> 25:27.822
Your past is a part of you.

25:27.985 --> 25:30.113
There is nothing you can do about that,
you can't change it.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.411
Doesn't mean it has to be your anchor.

25:40.539 --> 25:43.543
<i>The other names in that book
are waiting for you, Oliver.</i>

25:44.293 --> 25:47.217
- They're waiting for you at home.
- I know.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.423
Leaving the Bratva
is not going to be easy.

25:50.924 --> 25:52.301
I swore an oath of allegiance.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.887
Your father asked you to
take a different vow, did he not?

25:55.721 --> 25:57.974
You told me he wanted you
to right his wrongs.

25:58.515 --> 26:00.017
<i>You cannot do that from here.</i>

26:06.482 --> 26:10.237
Can I come in,
or is it still "no dogs allowed?"

26:10.527 --> 26:13.747
You really got
a wise-ass mouth on you, don't you?

26:13.906 --> 26:16.830
I'm not sure, but did you just say
my mouth looks like ass?

26:17.910 --> 26:19.287
Look, I just came in here to tell you that

26:19.453 --> 26:21.171
Susan Williams'
producer called to confirm that

26:21.330 --> 26:23.378
10:00 a.m. tomorrow
still works for the interview.

26:23.540 --> 26:24.883
When did you become my assistant?

26:26.627 --> 26:28.345
When I answered the phone, I guess.

26:30.839 --> 26:32.182
It was out of line
bringing up my daughter.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.844
You gonna tell that to Susan Williams
at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow?

26:35.385 --> 26:37.763
Look, man,
you expecting me to give you an apology,

26:37.930 --> 26:39.898
- you don't know me that well.
- I don't know you at all.

26:40.682 --> 26:44.528
But my sponsor says that
I'm the one that owes you the apology.

26:44.686 --> 26:46.688
- It's cool, hoss.
- No, it's not cool.

26:49.358 --> 26:50.701
My daughter, Laurel, is gone.

26:53.070 --> 26:56.620
And I gotta figure out a way to live with
that which doesn't involve booze

26:58.867 --> 27:00.790
or snapping at guys
that are just trying to help.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.791
You know, 10:00 a.m.
will be here before you know it.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.252
How about another dry run?

27:09.795 --> 27:11.968
- Take a seat.
- Atta boy.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.223
Quit calling me "hoss."

27:15.050 --> 27:17.098
All right. You ready?

27:17.553 --> 27:20.227
- Where are your questions?
- I got 'em right here.

27:22.224 --> 27:24.352
Where were you?
Did you take Dinah somewhere?

27:25.102 --> 27:26.103
Yes, but not like that.

27:26.270 --> 27:28.489
Okay, what happens in Russia,
stays in Russia, remember?

27:28.647 --> 27:31.070
- Where's Walker's man?
- Curtis and Rory are keeping eyes on him.

27:31.233 --> 27:32.780
I think she means protecting him from me.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.486
Oliver, I still think it's a mistake

27:34.653 --> 27:36.576
not pushing the scumbag
for the location of the sale.

27:36.738 --> 27:38.490
We don't have to,
we're gonna have it within the hour.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.910
- What? How?
- Bratva.

27:41.076 --> 27:43.625
Hey, Anatoly wasn't playing ball
unless you did the Bratva's dirty work...

27:44.454 --> 27:46.502
Which is where you took Dinah.

27:46.915 --> 27:48.917
Oliver, I thought you didn't
want anything to do with the Bratva.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.132
I don't, but if it's a choice between
me crossing a line

27:51.295 --> 27:53.889
and the two of you crossing one,
that is a very easy choice.

27:55.591 --> 27:56.934
- What did you do?
- Doesn't matter.

27:57.509 --> 28:00.479
Here's what does. I am who I am.

28:01.430 --> 28:02.773
Now, I'm trying to work past that.

28:02.931 --> 28:05.150
Maybe I do, maybe I don't, but I cannot,

28:05.309 --> 28:08.734
I will not have the two of you
make the same mistakes.

28:08.937 --> 28:10.234
Oliver, you're the one that taught us

28:10.397 --> 28:13.446
that sometimes you have to
get in the muck to make things right.

28:13.609 --> 28:16.783
Well, then Prometheus wins
because he'll be right.

28:17.446 --> 28:20.575
I need the two of you to prove to him,
and quite frankly,

28:20.741 --> 28:22.709
to prove to me that he's not.

28:24.369 --> 28:26.212
I need the two of you
to be better than me.

28:27.497 --> 28:31.422
Because you are.
That's why we work together.

28:33.003 --> 28:35.847
Uh, there is a whole mess
of angry Russian dudes outside.

28:45.599 --> 28:48.978
I have location for Walker,
and men to help in fight.

28:49.186 --> 28:50.403
<i>But we have to leave now.</i>

28:52.397 --> 28:54.525
Your strange friend's pronunciation
is horrible.

28:54.691 --> 28:56.238
Yeah, I'll tutor him later.

29:09.957 --> 29:10.958
<i>He'!-</i>

29:11.708 --> 29:13.255
Pleasure doing business with you, Lev.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.050
You sure you don't wanna
toast the transaction?

29:16.255 --> 29:18.678
Ah, I'd love to,
but I got a plane to catch.

29:18.882 --> 29:20.805
And there's someone I'm trying to avoid.

29:21.510 --> 29:24.730
- American government?
- I wish it were just them.

29:35.190 --> 29:38.069
Green Arrow, tango headed your way.
I love saying the word "tango."

29:38.235 --> 29:39.282
So do I.

30:04.386 --> 30:06.229
Okay, in the future,
you might not wanna do that

30:06.388 --> 30:07.765
with a van carrying a nuclear bomb!

30:10.684 --> 30:12.357
That was a neat trick.
Now what's your plan?

30:27.743 --> 30:29.245
Stay down, you son of a bitch.

30:30.162 --> 30:31.414
Who the hell are you?

30:34.291 --> 30:36.089
You didn't expect to
see me here, did you, General?

30:36.501 --> 30:38.094
And no one's gonna believe that I was.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.223
But everyone's gonna know that you tried
to sell a nuclear bomb to terrorists.

30:41.631 --> 30:45.511
You're assuming I actually meant to
sell a bomb to the Markovians, John.

30:51.808 --> 30:52.809
Bomb's not here.

30:55.103 --> 30:58.152
Walker's headed for the hangar.
Odds are that's where the nuke is.

30:58.315 --> 30:59.362
Felicity!

31:00.442 --> 31:01.534
Why the ruse?

31:01.693 --> 31:03.661
Why sell a nuclear weapon once

31:03.820 --> 31:07.165
when I can steal it back and
sell it to another rebel sucker?

31:10.035 --> 31:11.082
Rory?

31:12.704 --> 31:13.796
Curtis told me you needed some help.

31:13.955 --> 31:15.332
He was probably worried
I'd do something stupid.

31:15.499 --> 31:17.297
Those were his exact words, actually.

31:17.459 --> 31:18.460
Okay, you need to get out of here.

31:18.627 --> 31:19.879
I think he said those would be
your exact words.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.046
The bomb is in countdown mode.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.214
<i>- What?
- It's wired with a failsafe.</i>

31:22.381 --> 31:23.928
We must have triggered it
when we entered the hangar.

31:24.091 --> 31:25.764
- Can you disarm it?
- If I can't,

31:26.301 --> 31:28.303
the yield of this thing
will spread over 50 miles.

31:31.556 --> 31:32.728
Do it.

31:33.683 --> 31:34.935
You know you want to.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.528
Come on, John, you have to.

31:38.605 --> 31:40.778
I got a lot of friends, John.

31:40.941 --> 31:43.490
Lots of resources
with itchy trigger fingers.

31:44.444 --> 31:48.324
And you, well, you got a wife and kid.

31:51.284 --> 31:53.161
Terrific, Overwatch,
any luck locating the nuke?

31:53.328 --> 31:55.171
<i>Overwatch is off comms
and in the hangar.</i>

31:55.330 --> 31:57.833
I think she's trying to
disable the nuke herself.

31:57.999 --> 32:00.422
- I'm on my way.
- No, no, no, no. No!

32:00.627 --> 32:02.174
- What happened?
- Trapdoor code,

32:02.337 --> 32:03.634
<i>- I walked right into it.
- RORY". What does that mean?</i>

32:03.797 --> 32:07.051
Any attempt to disarm the nuke will
exponentially pace up the countdown clock.

32:07.217 --> 32:08.639
Wait, what are you doing?

32:08.802 --> 32:10.304
Hoping like hell I can
figure out how to fly a plane.

32:10.470 --> 32:11.562
- What?
- I can't disarm the nuke,

32:11.721 --> 32:13.723
but hopefully I can get it
to a less populated area.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.767
Less populated? What, like Havenrock?

32:15.934 --> 32:17.311
This isn't the time to revisit that.

32:17.477 --> 32:19.275
No. No, no, this is exactly the time.

32:19.688 --> 32:21.656
The rags survived Havenrock,
they can survive this, too.

32:21.815 --> 32:24.034
I can use them to
contain the blast and the radiation!

32:24.192 --> 32:27.537
- No, you don't know that!
- Well, I don't need to know, I have faith.

32:27.696 --> 32:29.198
Okay, but it should be me. Not you.

32:29.364 --> 32:31.366
I don't have time
to take these rags off, so...

32:31.700 --> 32:34.544
Go! Just in case this, you know,
doesn't work.

32:35.328 --> 32:36.500
Felicity, go!

32:39.040 --> 32:40.917
Do it. Go on.

32:45.255 --> 32:48.885
No, General. No, you're gonna stand trial.

32:49.718 --> 32:51.220
I'm gonna see that justice is done.

33:04.608 --> 33:05.609
What's happening?

33:13.074 --> 33:14.326
- Rory!
- Oh, my God!

33:16.411 --> 33:19.210
- Well, he always gets the credit.
- Are you okay?

33:19.498 --> 33:22.047
This means I get a promotion, right?

33:31.927 --> 33:34.521
To Rory and his
amazing nuke-stopping rags,

33:34.679 --> 33:36.681
which hopefully doesn't
give us all radiation poisoning.

33:41.811 --> 33:44.155
- Wimps.
- Yeah, can't you hold your vodka?

33:44.314 --> 33:46.533
Now you my favorite American.

33:47.609 --> 33:48.656
Did you hear from Lyla?

33:49.277 --> 33:51.700
Walker's being escorted
under military guard as we speak.

33:51.863 --> 33:52.864
Congratulations.

33:53.031 --> 33:56.035
You know, well, Walker threatened
JJ and Lyla, just like Andy did.

33:57.661 --> 33:59.755
First, I wondered why
I didn't shoot him like I did Andy,

34:01.998 --> 34:03.966
then I remembered
what you said to me and Felicity.

34:04.125 --> 34:05.468
Well, I'm just glad that it took.

34:06.002 --> 34:07.504
But, you know, Oliver, you were wrong.

34:07.671 --> 34:09.264
Me and Felicity, we're no better than you.

34:09.797 --> 34:14.143
You, me, Felicity,
we make each other better.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.938
- I'll drink to that.
- You're my brother, Oliver.

34:20.891 --> 34:25.112
Oliver. It's good,
good being friends again.

34:25.981 --> 34:27.699
I forgot how strong this is over here.

34:28.650 --> 34:30.527
I make sure I bring some
when I come to Star City.

34:31.152 --> 34:32.199
Yeah.

34:34.114 --> 34:37.118
Ah, I hear you're mayor now.
Big promotion.

34:37.701 --> 34:39.668
Now you Pakhan,
now you tell everyone what to do.

34:39.828 --> 34:41.795
That's not how things work in America,
Anatoly.

34:41.955 --> 34:43.797
Yeah, that's the way things work
everywhere.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.592
I was hoping maybe you could repay me.

34:46.751 --> 34:48.924
- I thought we were even.
- I thought you return to Bratva.

34:49.838 --> 34:50.885
That was temporary.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.684
That is thing about oaths, Oliver.

34:55.635 --> 34:59.185
They are never temporary,
they are for life.

35:13.903 --> 35:15.325
I need to speak with Anatoly.

35:17.574 --> 35:18.666
Where have you been?

35:19.492 --> 35:22.041
I need to speak with Anatoly.

35:23.496 --> 35:24.497
Where is he?

35:40.305 --> 35:41.352
Anatoly?

35:42.766 --> 35:45.440
Oliver? Is that you?

35:45.894 --> 35:46.895
Yeah.

35:49.397 --> 35:50.444
What happened?

35:51.232 --> 35:52.324
Gregor.

35:53.443 --> 35:55.741
I questioned his deal with Kovar.

35:56.613 --> 35:57.660
He did this to me.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.583
You were right about him.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.750
His loyalty lies with Kovar.

36:06.081 --> 36:09.927
But Gregor is Pakhan.
There is nothing we can do.

36:10.877 --> 36:11.924
That's not true.

36:14.839 --> 36:15.886
We can kill him.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.766
You are my brother, Oliver.

36:25.934 --> 36:28.858
Oleg said that you
needed to tell me something.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.527
That can wait.

36:44.953 --> 36:48.799
You know,
if visiting Star City's "sister city"

36:48.957 --> 36:50.459
is what it took to get you to bed,

36:50.625 --> 36:53.754
I would've bought you
a ticket to Russia months ago.

36:57.465 --> 36:58.967
A friend of mine told me that

37:00.969 --> 37:02.812
my past doesn't have to be my anchor.

37:05.432 --> 37:07.981
And I think my past is what was

37:09.185 --> 37:11.654
stopping me from
moving things forward with you.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.329
Looking at all this, I can understand why.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.618
What exactly happened
to you on that island, anyway?

37:25.535 --> 37:27.333
Things that I'm not ready to talk about.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.459
Not even this crazy tattoo?

37:29.956 --> 37:32.425
I mean, how do you even get
something like this on a deserted island...

37:32.584 --> 37:33.836
Hey, hey.

37:36.755 --> 37:37.881
You're not ready to talk about it.

37:38.339 --> 37:39.886
- Mmm-hmm.
- Right. Okay.

37:40.300 --> 37:43.930
Do you mean, like, not now or not ever?

37:45.013 --> 37:46.060
Not now.

37:48.308 --> 37:49.355
Maybe someday?

37:51.311 --> 37:52.358
Yeah.

37:53.354 --> 37:54.355
I can wait for someday.

38:21.090 --> 38:23.218
Hey, what'd that bag ever do to you, huh?

38:23.885 --> 38:25.353
<i>- You got</i> a <i>minute?
- Sure.</i>

38:26.179 --> 38:28.398
How'd the interview go with
Oliver's girlfriend?

38:28.598 --> 38:29.599
Cakewalk.

38:30.391 --> 38:33.645
In fact, I asked her if she
went easy on me and she said she did.

38:35.688 --> 38:37.110
'Cause of something you said to her.

38:39.651 --> 38:40.743
L didn't say much.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.994
L just told her a story about you and me.

38:45.156 --> 38:48.080
- You and me?
- I figured you didn't remember.

38:48.868 --> 38:51.997
When I was a kid,
you were a beat cop on my block.

38:52.705 --> 38:54.252
You caught me tagging a building,

38:57.001 --> 39:00.881
but instead of hauling me in,
you crouched down,

39:01.756 --> 39:03.508
looked me in the eye and told me...

39:05.635 --> 39:07.603
I could be more than just
some rip-run thug.

39:09.722 --> 39:13.443
It really set me on a better path.
You did, I mean.

39:15.228 --> 39:17.105
I had no idea, Rene.

39:17.272 --> 39:18.774
Anyway, I just wanted the reporter to know

39:18.940 --> 39:20.738
just what kinda guy
she was sitting down with.

39:21.860 --> 39:24.363
Didn't you still get dishonorably
discharged from the military, though?

39:29.993 --> 39:31.040
Nobody's perfect.

39:46.885 --> 39:47.977
<i>Hey.</i>

39:49.053 --> 39:51.476
Hey. What're you doing here?

39:51.806 --> 39:54.309
Well, I'm just making sure
you're not radioactive.

39:56.144 --> 39:58.943
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yeah, I'm sorry. I was...

39:59.355 --> 40:00.447
I was gonna call.

40:01.608 --> 40:04.532
Well, I was probably gonna
wimp out and text.

40:04.694 --> 40:05.695
What's going on?

40:12.201 --> 40:15.125
The blast did something to them.
They don't work anymore.

40:15.788 --> 40:19.838
I don't have any control.
They don't offer any protection.

40:21.336 --> 40:23.009
- Well, I'm sure it's just temporary.
- I'm not.

40:23.546 --> 40:26.220
I have a bond with them, Felicity,
I can feel it.

40:26.549 --> 40:29.598
And let's be honest,
without the rags, I'm a liability.

40:30.219 --> 40:32.688
And one the team can't risk,
not with Prometheus out there.

40:32.847 --> 40:34.941
Okay, well, that doesn't
mean you have to leave.

40:35.099 --> 40:37.397
Don't worry. I'll be back.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.104
You'll, uh...

40:41.773 --> 40:43.195
You'll let the team know?

40:43.399 --> 40:48.030
Yeah. I mean,
I'll probably just wimp out and text.

41:11.928 --> 41:13.555
- Well?
- You were right.

41:14.806 --> 41:18.481
All the guys in this photo are Bratva.
Means "brotherhood" in Russian.

41:18.643 --> 41:19.644
<i>I</i> know.

41:19.811 --> 41:22.781
Bratva get tattoos on their chests
when they make captain.

41:22.939 --> 41:24.065
What about the other thing?

41:24.232 --> 41:26.576
Nah, I couldn't find
anything else on Queen in Russia.

41:26.901 --> 41:29.154
But I reviewed criminal activity

41:29.320 --> 41:31.914
from the period he was there,
and I found something very interesting.

41:33.157 --> 41:36.411
The Russians call him <i>Luchnik,</i>
the Archer.

41:36.577 --> 41:38.420
Does he remind you of anyone you know?

41:38.830 --> 41:39.877
The Green Arrow.

41:40.999 --> 41:43.593
Now, what are the odds of Oliver Queen

41:43.751 --> 41:46.300
and the Green Arrow
being in Russia at the same time?

41:48.673 --> 41:49.890
Very good...

41:50.925 --> 41:52.927
If Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow.
