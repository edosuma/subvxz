WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:03.003
GILES:
 Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:03.036 --> 00:04.504
(gasps)

00:04.538 --> 00:07.807
Evil. They want an apocalypse.
Well, we'll give 'em one.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.477
'Cause we just
became an army.

00:09.509 --> 00:11.211
I'm not saying
it's a happy scenario,

00:11.244 --> 00:14.048
but we're dealing
with a big bad that can be
any dead person it wants.

00:14.082 --> 00:17.085
What do you want from me,
Jonathan/the First?

00:17.117 --> 00:18.719
I have an assignment for you.

00:18.751 --> 00:20.088
You want me to hurt the girls?

00:20.120 --> 00:22.655
The girls must die.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.492
Nice place.
A bit of a mess.

00:24.524 --> 00:27.195
-BUFFY: They're all Slayers?
-Potential Slayers,

00:27.228 --> 00:29.062
waiting for one to be called.

00:29.097 --> 00:31.399
There were many more like them
all over the world,

00:31.431 --> 00:33.366
but, um, now
there's just a handful,

00:33.401 --> 00:35.069
and they're all
 on their way to Sunnydale.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.536
Glad we talked.

00:36.570 --> 00:39.439
In the spirit
of air clearing--

00:39.472 --> 00:40.908
Yeah?

00:40.941 --> 00:43.243
I feel like
I need to be honest
about something.

00:46.579 --> 00:48.415
BUFFY:
 Spike has a soul now.

00:48.448 --> 00:50.451
That's what's gonna stop him
 from hurting people.

00:50.484 --> 00:53.454
-Buffy--
-He can be a good man, Giles.

00:53.487 --> 00:54.655
I feel it.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.063
I guess we should talk.

01:03.097 --> 01:05.299
How do you know
about Slayers?

01:05.331 --> 01:08.368
My mother was one.
She was killed
when I was four.

01:08.402 --> 01:12.105
-Something got to her?
A demon--
-A vampire.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.941
-So how do you two
know each other?
-He works with me.

01:16.009 --> 01:18.912
You know,
 in the struggle against evil.

01:18.945 --> 01:20.248
He's a vampire.

01:20.281 --> 01:23.817
-I should move out.
-No. You have to stay.

01:23.850 --> 01:26.219
No, you got another
demon fighter now.

01:26.254 --> 01:28.087
That's not why
I need you here.

01:28.121 --> 01:32.759
-Why's that then?
-'Cause I'm not ready for you
to not be here.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.995
-You're not my mother.
-WOMAN: Would you like to know
who killed me?

01:35.027 --> 01:37.831
You met him.
 You know him.

01:37.865 --> 01:40.301
You fought by his side.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.137
Spike.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.389
(crying softly)

02:40.194 --> 02:42.195
Chloe?

02:42.229 --> 02:44.432
It is Chloe, right?

02:53.706 --> 02:56.377
-It's not enough!
-(gasps)

03:14.562 --> 03:16.229
(theme music playing)

04:05.278 --> 04:07.381
I'm a bright girl.
Good education.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.483
Quick on the uptake.

04:09.516 --> 04:11.585
So tell me. Why in the name
of almighty Grothnar...

04:11.618 --> 04:13.454
would I let myself
become human again?

04:14.788 --> 04:17.223
You're really talkin'
to the wrong fellow.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.394
I mean, sure, the vengeance
demon gig has some downsides.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.829
All jobs do.

04:21.862 --> 04:25.165
I mean, being human--
(groans)

04:25.197 --> 04:28.302
You're always
icky on the inside
and disgusting on the outside.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.370
Your outside's not so bad.

04:33.606 --> 04:35.509
Y-You know, the only thing
worse thing than being human...

04:35.543 --> 04:37.845
is being trapped inside
a household full of humans.

04:37.877 --> 04:39.278
Preachin' to the choir, love.

04:39.312 --> 04:41.449
I mean, it's like we live
in Slayer Central.

04:41.481 --> 04:45.185
I swear, if Buffy rooms
or boards one more
of the Potential girls,

04:45.218 --> 04:48.355
I'm gonna call a--
I'm gonna call
a health inspector.

04:48.389 --> 04:52.492
I like my plan better.
Get up, get out, get drunk.

04:52.526 --> 04:55.396
Repeat as needed.
It's just more elegant.

04:58.531 --> 05:00.600
Thanks for havin' me along.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.769
Don't mention it.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.971
At first I thought,
it's weird.

05:05.004 --> 05:07.341
Is Spike asking me out
on a date?

05:07.375 --> 05:09.843
'Cause that would just be...

05:09.877 --> 05:12.012
nuts.
(chuckles)

05:12.045 --> 05:15.382
Right. I'm just out
for the alcohol.

05:15.415 --> 05:18.151
Right there
with you, scooter.

05:18.185 --> 05:21.654
Tonight, I plan to drink you
under the table.

05:21.689 --> 05:24.557
-You're on then.
-Good.

05:26.225 --> 05:29.797
Of course,
once you're down there,
I could join you.

05:29.829 --> 05:33.033
Kidding. I like my sex
on top of the table.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.502
Would you let it go?

05:35.536 --> 05:37.838
You're like a dog
with a bone.

05:37.870 --> 05:40.807
-So what?
-It's my bone. Just drop it.

05:40.841 --> 05:45.345
Okay. Okay.
I wasn't proposing.

05:45.379 --> 05:47.715
Time goes by,
a girl gets hungry.
You should know.

05:47.747 --> 05:49.382
-Oh, thank God.
-What?

05:49.417 --> 05:50.951
-Demon.
-Huh?

05:52.084 --> 05:54.822
D'Hoffryn says you die.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.389
Of course he does.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.096
Oh, hey!

06:06.600 --> 06:08.367
BUFFY:
This may mean more
than you think.

06:08.401 --> 06:11.872
That so?
Because I think
what we have here...

06:11.904 --> 06:15.776
is a couple of chuckleheads
who thought that a cafeteria
fistfight would impress.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.944
I'm not impressed.
Buffy, are you impressed?

06:19.413 --> 06:23.817
Still, I'm gonna cut you guys
some slack this time.

06:27.555 --> 06:31.459
Third fight this week,
and it's just getting worse.

06:31.492 --> 06:35.228
Plus, a rise in vandalism,
three students missing.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.632
Tell me something, Buffy.
In your professional opinion--

06:39.667 --> 06:42.134
-(bell ringing)
-(chattering)

06:45.605 --> 06:47.475
It's started, hasn't it?

06:49.742 --> 06:53.312
The Hellmouth has begun
its semiannual percolation.

06:53.346 --> 06:56.917
-Usually it blows around May.
-Was it like this before?

06:56.949 --> 07:00.553
I mean, it just seems to me
as if things are getting
bad faster than we thought.

07:00.588 --> 07:05.057
-We're a little
ahead of schedule.
-I can't say I'm too surprised.

07:05.091 --> 07:08.762
I knew I signed on
for somethin',
but, Buffy, I'm just a guy--

07:08.795 --> 07:12.331
granted, a cool and sexy
vampire-fightin' guy,
but still--

07:12.365 --> 07:14.468
Don't forget snappy dresser.

07:14.502 --> 07:16.637
Mmm. Thank you.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.505
But this is gonna get
bigger than me.

07:18.538 --> 07:20.007
Yeah, it is.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.341
That's why I've decided
to give you this.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.317
-What is it?
-An emergency kit.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.353
This bag belonged
to my mother.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.191
A Slayer keepsake.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.259
-I-I couldn't.
-No, you have to.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.262
Technically, it should've been
passed down directly to you
through the years,

07:43.295 --> 07:45.598
but after my mother died,

07:45.632 --> 07:48.067
I guess I just couldn't
part with it.

07:50.403 --> 07:51.672
Wow.

07:51.704 --> 07:53.340
I don't know what's
inside exactly,

07:53.372 --> 07:56.043
but I know it has something
to do with her power--

07:56.076 --> 07:58.612
well, your power now.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.814
I-I don't know what to say.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.016
Try saying, "Thank you,
Principal Wood."

08:03.050 --> 08:05.151
Thank you, Principal Wood.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.721
Ah, call me Robin.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.589
And now I'd like
to see where you work.

08:11.190 --> 08:14.060
Uh, here, actually.

08:14.093 --> 08:18.464
Uh, th-this is
my desk, and, uh,
these are-are my pencils.

08:18.497 --> 08:21.201
No. Where you do
your other work.

08:23.370 --> 08:26.238
So, all the potential Slayers
who seem to keep popping up...

08:26.273 --> 08:29.742
from, like, every corner of
the earth were getting killed.

08:29.776 --> 08:32.412
-By the First.
-Agents of.

08:32.445 --> 08:33.980
We thought the council
could protect them,

08:34.014 --> 08:35.381
but unfortunately no one
was protecting the council,

08:35.414 --> 08:38.085
and all their Watchers
were killed.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.352
Word got out, and they've all
been comin' here since.

08:40.385 --> 08:43.222
There's nothin' like
the end of the world
to bring people together.

08:43.255 --> 08:47.860
It's heartwarming.
Anyway, this is, uh, it--
command central.

08:50.764 --> 08:54.033
Where the hell have you been?
This funnel cake
is kicking my ass.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.168
Yeah, I hear they're tricky.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.338
Robin Wood, this is Andrew.

08:59.371 --> 09:01.274
It's a pleasure.

09:01.307 --> 09:03.876
Andrew is our--

09:03.910 --> 09:06.178
Actually, he's our hostage.

09:06.212 --> 09:10.383
I like to think of myself
more as a "guestage."

09:10.417 --> 09:13.452
So, you-- you hold him here
against his will?

09:13.485 --> 09:17.625
Well, he was evil,
and people got killed,
and now he bakes.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.893
I-It's a thing.
Oh.

09:19.927 --> 09:23.764
Could we try to just keep
our secret headquarters
a little bit secret?

09:23.797 --> 09:26.432
You keep bringin' people in,
they're gonna see everything.

09:26.466 --> 09:28.902
They'll see the big board.

09:28.936 --> 09:32.004
Andrew, we don't have
a big board.

09:35.442 --> 09:37.376
I, uh, made it myself.

09:37.409 --> 09:38.778
Oh, I wouldn't have guessed.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.880
Uh, this is us.

09:40.913 --> 09:45.753
And this represents the First,
in various incarnations.

09:45.786 --> 09:49.588
And, uh, there's no pattern
to the naked eye yet,

09:49.623 --> 09:52.960
but the instant one emerges,
yours truly is on it.

10:00.432 --> 10:02.501
Where do we put our receipts?

10:05.504 --> 10:07.407
You'll have to forgive Andrew.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.009
Or not. Your call.

10:10.043 --> 10:13.681
We do have a lot more
working for us than
just the, uh, big board.

10:13.714 --> 10:16.448
So I see.

10:16.482 --> 10:18.451
Potentials:
(karate shouts)

10:18.485 --> 10:20.988
Punch-block combo!

10:21.020 --> 10:23.691
-(shouts continue)
-Cross, block, kick!

10:25.658 --> 10:27.494
Chamber your energy.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.398
Punch-block combo!

10:32.665 --> 10:36.703
Hold it! What the hell
you call that, Potential?

10:36.736 --> 10:39.206
Try that in the field,
and you are dead.
Drop and give me 20.

10:39.239 --> 10:40.707
Twenty what?

10:40.740 --> 10:42.710
Pushups, maggot!

10:51.418 --> 10:54.453
I love this job.
Did you see that?

10:54.486 --> 10:57.857
I called that girl a maggot.
Hi. Who the hell are you?

10:58.926 --> 11:01.327
-An ally.
-So, what do you think?

11:01.360 --> 11:04.464
My girls ready
to kick some ass or what?

11:04.496 --> 11:06.666
Looking strong.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.467
But?

11:08.500 --> 11:12.272
I'm just not sure the First
has an ass you can actually,
you know, kick.

11:12.371 --> 11:13.974
I guess we'll see.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.208
Principal Wood, hi!

11:16.243 --> 11:19.712
It's so weird seeing you
outside of school.

11:19.746 --> 11:21.782
What are you waving at,
Potential?

11:23.515 --> 11:25.985
-Attention!
-BUFFY: You're right.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.755
-Rising sun!
-It's not enough.

11:28.788 --> 11:31.158
-That's not what I said, Buffy.
-KENNEDY: Begin.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.225
-(karate shouts)
-It's an impressive group
of recruits.

11:33.259 --> 11:35.729
-They're not recruits.
-Punch-block combo!

11:35.763 --> 11:38.865
-Recruits are recruited.
-Punch, block, kick!

11:38.899 --> 11:41.033
-These girls were chosen.
-(shouts continue)

11:41.067 --> 11:43.536
-You're doin' the best you can
with what you've got.
-Rising sun.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.605
BUFFY:
They're not all gonna make it.

11:45.638 --> 11:48.408
Some will die, and nothin'
I can do will stop that.

11:48.441 --> 11:51.211
-Attention!
-Oh, hi.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.113
-Hey.
-Chamber your energy.

11:53.145 --> 11:58.717
Well, Buffy, I-- I see
that our preparation
for the school...

11:58.751 --> 12:03.722
pep-dance-cheer-drill contest
are coming along.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.893
-(chuckles)
Bring it on!
-(karate commands continue)

12:05.926 --> 12:08.061
It's okay.
I filled him in on everything.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.596
Oh, thank God.

12:09.629 --> 12:12.899
If I had to explain
all these weapons,
I had nothing.

12:15.434 --> 12:19.306
Buffy tells me you've been, uh--
Oh, how shall I put it?

12:19.338 --> 12:22.274
Experimenting...
with the magics.

12:22.308 --> 12:24.311
Oh, yeah.

12:24.344 --> 12:28.715
Nothing too heavy though.
Just the lighter, safer stuff.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.784
If Kennedy asks,
her pointy stuff's right there.

12:31.818 --> 12:33.986
See ya inside.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.989
-So much cooler than Snyder.
-(karate commands continue)

12:39.826 --> 12:42.162
(sighs)

12:42.195 --> 12:44.663
She really almost
destroyed the world?

12:44.697 --> 12:46.633
Yep.

12:46.665 --> 12:48.768
Remind me not
to make her crabby.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.336
Might be better
if you did.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.139
How's that work?

12:52.172 --> 12:54.807
Oh, I don't know.

12:54.841 --> 13:00.080
It's just--
The First is coming,
and then look at us, the army.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.816
We've got a bunch of fighters
with nothing to hit,

13:02.850 --> 13:06.452
a Wicca who won't-a,
and the brains of our operation
wears oven mitts.

13:06.485 --> 13:10.957
Mmm. Well, you're
redefining the job, Buffy,
and that takes guts.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.692
This isn't your
full arsenal anyway.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.528
Show me the vampire.

13:16.562 --> 13:19.532
-ANYA:
But you just let him go.
-After saving your life.

13:19.566 --> 13:22.469
For now. That was one of
D'Hoffryn's killers, Spike.

13:22.501 --> 13:25.004
-He won't stop coming
till he kills me.
-Yet here you are--

13:25.038 --> 13:27.539
walkin', talkin', annoyin'.

13:27.573 --> 13:30.009
But you fought like such
a "wimpvire," what with
the lifting and the running.

13:30.043 --> 13:33.880
-Why not just kill him?
-Anya, think.

13:33.913 --> 13:38.018
I fight, demon boy gets lucky,
I get knocked out,
you get killed. True?

13:40.220 --> 13:42.990
We both know the safest
and sanest way
of saving your life...

13:43.023 --> 13:45.557
is to keep you with me,
away from danger.

13:45.591 --> 13:47.460
Oh.

13:47.494 --> 13:51.264
No need to thank me.
I'm just the one
who beat him off.

13:53.066 --> 13:56.036
"Repelled him" would perhaps
be the better phrase.

13:56.068 --> 13:57.803
Demon.

13:57.836 --> 13:59.338
Figured.

13:59.371 --> 14:01.408
I hope we're not intruding.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.809
Not a bit.

14:03.842 --> 14:06.578
Just what brings
our good principal to
this neck of the gloom?

14:06.613 --> 14:10.750
I'm showing him
our operation-- us.

14:12.219 --> 14:15.522
Fine by me.
Big fight against evil
comin' up.

14:15.554 --> 14:17.657
The more good guys we've got,
the longer we'll all live.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.726
Is that what you are,
a good guy?

14:20.759 --> 14:22.828
I haven't
heard any complaints.

14:22.861 --> 14:24.998
Well, I have heard
a few complaints
over the years,

14:25.032 --> 14:27.734
but then I just killed
whoever spoke up, and that
was pretty much that.

14:27.767 --> 14:28.902
He's joking.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.769
No, he's not.

14:30.802 --> 14:33.039
No, I'm not.

14:33.072 --> 14:36.342
But that's the old me
I'm talkin' about.

14:36.375 --> 14:40.379
-Why don't you
tell me about that?
-There's not much to tell.

14:40.413 --> 14:45.085
-I've changed.
-Oh. Now that
you have a soul.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.755
Yeah. That was a big deal.

14:49.788 --> 14:53.192
Very private.
What, are you just
tellin' everyone now?

14:53.225 --> 14:55.894
Oh, come on, Spike.
Don't blame Buffy.
I asked.

14:57.830 --> 15:00.967
Right. The educator.

15:05.437 --> 15:08.375
Yeah, I went to great lengths,
lots of trouble.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.910
And now I'm unique.
Well, more or less.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.947
Got myself a soul.
Whatever that means.

15:14.981 --> 15:16.649
How's that workin' out for you?

15:16.682 --> 15:18.717
In progress.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.787
Well, you've had some time.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.322
-You've been
in Sunnydale, what--
-Years.

15:23.355 --> 15:25.125
-How many?
-A few.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.658
-Before that?
-Around.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.433
I think we'd better
get back upstairs.

15:34.466 --> 15:37.803
Right. Give him
the full tour.

15:37.836 --> 15:40.106
You don't want to miss
a look at her weapons chest.

15:46.379 --> 15:49.149
So, I took a look
inside that emergency bag
of Principal Wood's.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.484
-And?
-It smelled weird.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.986
Kind of like Grandma's
closet, but worse.

15:54.020 --> 15:57.090
I didn't know
that was possible.
Anything we could use?

15:57.124 --> 16:00.360
Trinkets, weapons,
one very large textbook.

16:01.561 --> 16:04.163
Translation's gonna
be a bitch but--

16:04.197 --> 16:06.865
Did you know
the ancient Sumerians
did not speak English?

16:06.899 --> 16:09.168
(Scoffs)
They're worse
than the French.

16:09.201 --> 16:12.172
-Anything else?
-Uh, yeah. A box.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.706
A big, fat, unopenable box.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.110
I'm betting whatever
the big deal about
this emergency bag is,

16:17.144 --> 16:18.510
you'll find it in the box.

16:18.544 --> 16:21.947
Good. Keep on it.
Don't you have
any real homework?

16:21.980 --> 16:24.051
-Oh, you mean,
like schoolwork?
-Yes.

16:24.083 --> 16:27.187
Well, I've got a system.
It's called flunking out.
No, just kidding.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.688
I'm paying someone
to do my work.
I'm kidding!

16:29.721 --> 16:32.292
I love to see your eyeballs
change color when you
think I'm gonna flunk out.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.993
(gasps)

16:46.105 --> 16:48.006
What happened?
We heard--
(gasps)

16:48.040 --> 16:49.576
(girl gasps)

16:49.609 --> 16:53.046
Dawn, get a knife.
I'm cutting her down.

16:53.080 --> 16:56.415
Good thinking.
But, on the other hand,
why rush?

16:56.448 --> 17:00.886
Up or down,
I'll still be dead.

17:00.919 --> 17:04.356
-You're not Chloe.
-Yeah, well,
neither is she anymore.

17:04.391 --> 17:07.059
Now she's just
Chloe's body.

17:07.094 --> 17:08.493
What did you do to her?

17:08.528 --> 17:11.530
Nothing.
We just talked all night.

17:11.564 --> 17:15.233
Well, I did
most of the talking.
But Chloe is--

17:15.268 --> 17:20.873
I'm sorry-- was
a good listener,
till she hanged herself.

17:20.906 --> 17:24.076
Like when you
called her "maggot,"
she really heard that.

17:24.111 --> 17:26.278
Don't listen to it,
any of you.

17:26.313 --> 17:28.681
-It's the First.
-Oh, let 'em.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.849
The only reason
why Chloe offed herself...

17:30.883 --> 17:32.951
was 'cause she knew
what you're not getting.

17:32.984 --> 17:36.455
I'm coming. You're going.

17:37.656 --> 17:41.094
All this--
It's almost over.

17:41.127 --> 17:44.197
-We'll be here.
-All of you?

17:44.230 --> 17:46.699
But wait. I thought--

17:46.732 --> 17:48.867
BUFFY:
They're not all gonna make it.
Some will die,

17:48.901 --> 17:50.936
and there's nothing
I can do that will stop it.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.773
Hey, I didn't say it.

17:54.807 --> 17:58.577
But I'll be seeing all of you,
one by one.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.348
T.T.F.N.

18:05.317 --> 18:07.554
What's "T.T.F.N."?

18:07.586 --> 18:10.123
It's "ta-ta for now."

18:10.156 --> 18:13.425
It's what Tigger says
when he leaves.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.461
AMANDA:
Chloe loved Winnie the Pooh.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.935
Dawn, where's that knife?

18:44.223 --> 18:46.893
(quiet sobs)

18:50.529 --> 18:53.333
(indistinct whispers)

19:05.877 --> 19:07.846
Is everyone here?

19:09.882 --> 19:11.718
All accounted for.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.688
Anyone want to say
a few words about Chloe?

19:18.057 --> 19:19.358
Let me.

19:20.727 --> 19:26.232
Chloe was an idiot.
Chloe was stupid.

19:26.266 --> 19:30.001
She was weak.
And anyone in a rush to be
the next dead body I bury?

19:30.036 --> 19:34.973
It's easy.
Just think of Chloe
and do what she did,

19:35.007 --> 19:37.544
and I'll find room for you
next to her and Annabelle.

19:38.845 --> 19:42.481
I'm a Slayer,
the one with the power,

19:42.515 --> 19:45.684
and the First has me using
that power to dig our graves.

19:48.788 --> 19:53.692
I've been carrying you--
all of you-- too far, too long.

19:53.726 --> 19:56.863
-Ride's over.
-You're out of line.

19:56.895 --> 20:01.334
-No, she's not.
-You're gonna let her
talk to you like that?

20:01.367 --> 20:05.104
Willow, she's not even
the most powerful one
in this room.

20:05.136 --> 20:08.173
With you here,
she's not close.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.877
You're new here,
and you're wrong,

20:11.911 --> 20:14.212
because I use
the power that I have.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.516
The rest of you
are just waiting for me.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.451
Well, yeah,
but only because you
kind of told us to.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.921
You're our leader, Buffy,
as in "follow the."

20:21.953 --> 20:24.557
Well, from now on,
I'm your leader,
as in "do what I say."

20:24.590 --> 20:26.759
Jawohl!

20:26.792 --> 20:29.862
But let's not try to forget,
we're also your friends.

20:29.895 --> 20:33.766
-I'm not.
-Then why are you here?

20:33.799 --> 20:36.435
Aside from getting rescued,
what is it that you do?

20:38.837 --> 20:42.541
I provide much needed...
sarcasm.

20:42.575 --> 20:46.479
Um, that'd... kind of
be my job, actually.

20:46.512 --> 20:49.582
You're here
because you're scared.

20:49.615 --> 20:52.551
-Same goes for everyone
in this room.
-Fine.

20:52.585 --> 20:56.154
Anya, all of you,
be as scared as you'd like.

20:56.188 --> 21:00.092
-Just be useful
while you're at it.
-WILLOW: Come on, Buffy.

21:00.125 --> 21:02.429
You know everyone here is
doing everything they can.

21:02.461 --> 21:04.497
And the First isn't impressed.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.633
It already knows us.

21:06.665 --> 21:09.501
It knows what we can do,
and it's laughing.

21:09.536 --> 21:12.305
You want to surprise the enemy?
Surprise yourselves.

21:12.338 --> 21:16.808
Force yourself to do
what can't be done
or else we are not an army.

21:16.843 --> 21:19.878
We're just a bunch of girls
waiting to be picked off
and buried.

21:25.217 --> 21:28.587
-Where are you going?
-Out.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.823
Since I'm neither
a girl nor waiting,

21:30.856 --> 21:33.625
all this speechifying
doesn't really apply
to me, does it?

21:33.660 --> 21:35.862
Fine. Take a cell phone.

21:35.894 --> 21:38.830
That way, if I need someone
to get weepy or whaled on,
I can call you.

21:42.300 --> 21:45.637
-If you've got
something to say--
-I just said it.

21:45.672 --> 21:48.173
You keep holding back,
you might as well
walk out that door.

21:48.207 --> 21:52.177
Holding back? You're blind.

21:52.211 --> 21:55.146
I've been here,
right in it--
fighting, scrappin'.

21:55.181 --> 21:58.317
-Since you got your soul back?
-Well, as a matter of fact,

21:58.351 --> 22:01.820
I haven't been quite relishing
the kill the way I used to.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.321
You were a better fighter then.

22:03.355 --> 22:06.157
I did this for you!

22:06.192 --> 22:08.461
The soul, the changes--
It's what you wanted.

22:08.494 --> 22:11.163
What I want is
the Spike that's dangerous,

22:11.196 --> 22:13.532
the Spike that tried
to kill me when we met.

22:13.566 --> 22:16.502
Oh, you don't know
how close you are
to bringing him out.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.371
I'm nowhere near him.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.342
Dawn, get the Potentials
upstairs...

22:23.375 --> 22:25.478
and break out
that emergency kit.

22:25.511 --> 22:26.913
What are you gonna do?

22:26.945 --> 22:28.780
I'm declaring an emergency.

22:33.118 --> 22:35.422
-We thought you'd
want to be here.
-Yeah, you thought right.

22:35.454 --> 22:38.857
That emergency bag's
got some neat stuff in it.

22:38.891 --> 22:41.359
Weapons, charms,
advanced reading assignments.

22:41.394 --> 22:44.564
Yeah, cool stuff,
but we've seen it
all before.

22:44.596 --> 22:46.598
ANYA:
Well, not this we haven't.
What's inside it?

22:46.633 --> 22:50.236
Mmm, I don't know.
It hasn't been opened since--
Well, since now.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.208
Puppets.
(chuckles)

22:56.241 --> 23:01.012
That's it. The First
hates puppets. Now, if we can
just airlift Kermit,

23:01.047 --> 23:04.083
Fozzie the Bear,
and Miss Piggy into town,
the First would be a-runnin'.

23:04.115 --> 23:07.385
-Those are Muppets.
-And these things
are shadow-casters.

23:07.420 --> 23:11.557
You put them in motion,
and they tell you a story.

23:11.590 --> 23:14.794
It says, "You can't just watch.
You have to see."

23:14.826 --> 23:18.931
-What the hell does that mean?
-It's cryptic. I don't like it.

23:18.964 --> 23:23.603
Every time instructions
get cryptic, someone
gets hurt. Usually me.

23:23.635 --> 23:26.972
"You can't just watch.
You have to see"?
See what?

23:27.006 --> 23:29.642
That's where all my fancy
translating skills break down.

23:29.675 --> 23:31.778
But I think
it's an origin myth.

23:31.810 --> 23:33.378
The story of
the very first Slayer.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.047
I-I saw her.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.549
WOOD:
You saw the first Slayer?

23:37.584 --> 23:39.618
The other night, in my dream.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.186
It's gotta
mean something, right?

23:47.594 --> 23:50.930
Okay, according to this,
 I think,

23:52.298 --> 23:55.433
you put on
those puppet guys,
one by one.

23:55.468 --> 23:57.135
They cast shadows,
and the shadows tell the story.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.707
"First, there is the earth."

24:06.178 --> 24:08.114
(faint drumbeats)

24:08.146 --> 24:09.448
KENNEDY: What's that sound?

24:10.982 --> 24:12.618
Okay, so far, so creepy.

24:12.652 --> 24:15.186
Um... Okay.

24:15.221 --> 24:17.288
"Then there came the demons."

24:17.323 --> 24:20.992
(drums continue)

24:21.027 --> 24:24.530
-"After demons,
there came men."
-(faint roaring)

24:26.132 --> 24:29.300
"Men found a girl."

24:29.335 --> 24:32.771
-(woman screaming faintly)
-"And the men took the girl...

24:32.805 --> 24:37.276
"to fight the demon
of all demons.

24:37.308 --> 24:40.078
"They-- They chained her
to the earth.

24:41.212 --> 24:43.650
And then"--

24:43.682 --> 24:45.652
And I--

24:48.354 --> 24:50.957
I-I can't read this.

24:50.990 --> 24:54.192
-Something about darkness.
-What about darkness?

24:54.226 --> 24:56.295
It says,
"You cannot be shown.

24:56.327 --> 24:58.364
"You cannot just watch,
but you must see.

24:58.396 --> 25:01.232
See for yourself,
but only if you're willing
to make the exchange."

25:01.267 --> 25:03.335
When did you get
so good at Sumerian?

25:03.368 --> 25:05.104
It's not in Sumerian anymore.

25:06.505 --> 25:12.077
-(voices grow louder)
-(screaming)

25:27.559 --> 25:29.228
But what does it mean?

25:33.633 --> 25:35.835
It means
I have to go in there.

25:35.867 --> 25:39.070
No, it doesn't.
Where does it say that?
It doesn't say that.

25:39.105 --> 25:41.240
WOOD:
Buffy, you don't even know
what you're exchanging.

25:41.272 --> 25:43.009
You don't even know
if you're ready yet.

25:43.041 --> 25:44.777
That's the point.

25:44.810 --> 25:47.846
No, Buffy. We don't know
where you're going
or how we'll get you back.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.583
-Buffy, you can't.
-WILLOW: How will
we get you back?

25:50.616 --> 25:51.884
Find a way.

25:54.886 --> 25:57.088
-She's gone.
-Huh.

25:57.123 --> 25:58.724
ANYA:
What was that
about an exchange?

26:02.662 --> 26:05.964
-(growling)
-XANDER: Ah, this must be
the exchange student.

26:15.240 --> 26:18.109
Willow, use your magic
to send him back!

26:18.144 --> 26:20.946
I'm trying. Uh--
(speaking Latin)

26:28.319 --> 26:29.788
Weapons!

26:31.758 --> 26:33.592
(shouting)

26:33.625 --> 26:35.927
(screaming)

26:41.099 --> 26:44.737
Clear out of here,
all of you, unless you want
to end up all dead and useless.

26:44.770 --> 26:48.807
-What are you gonna do?
-What I do best.

27:07.026 --> 27:09.961
-Are you injured?
-Just hurt.

27:09.996 --> 27:12.932
Don't make
a case out of it.

27:12.964 --> 27:16.301
-How about you?
-I think we'll live.

27:16.335 --> 27:20.972
-Except maybe Spike.
-Is getting thrown through
the ceiling what he does best?

27:21.007 --> 27:24.309
-I'll go check on him.
-We've got bigger problems
than that.

27:24.343 --> 27:28.180
-Yeah. Demon loose, no Slayer.
-We need Buffy.

27:28.213 --> 27:31.817
You gotta get her back.
Looks like it's spell o'clock.

27:31.851 --> 27:35.054
Which spell? I mean,
didn't you see that thing?

27:35.086 --> 27:39.025
And you expect to reopen
the portal without sending
Willow off the deep end?

27:39.057 --> 27:41.126
-Thanks for your support.
-ANYA: Well, it's true.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.061
We're gonna have to
find another way.

27:43.095 --> 27:46.798
There isn't,
and Buffy knew it.

27:46.833 --> 27:50.068
-I've gotta get her back.
-We don't even know
where she went.

28:08.086 --> 28:10.890
Well, I guess that worked.

28:23.903 --> 28:26.172
-XANDER: Dawnie,
what does the book say?
-Not much.

28:26.204 --> 28:28.440
Once Buffy left, it got
a little tougher to read.

28:28.473 --> 28:30.276
Oh.

28:30.308 --> 28:33.378
It's okay. We'll just
start with what we know,
take it from there.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.914
Great. So far,
we know jack about squat.
Let's go from there.

28:35.948 --> 28:40.185
-You've got the magic. Use it.
-But I don't even know
what magic to use.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.587
Why not just try
all 32 flavors?

28:42.621 --> 28:44.790
Worst thing that happens is
you go brunette.

28:44.824 --> 28:46.724
WILLOW:
That's not the worst thing
that can happen.

28:46.759 --> 28:50.096
She's right.
And you know we have a choice.

28:50.128 --> 28:53.432
We can risk Willow's life
and the rest of our lives
to get Buffy back,

28:53.464 --> 28:55.300
or we leave her out there.

28:55.334 --> 28:58.403
If we play it safe back here,
Buffy could stay lost.

28:58.436 --> 29:00.739
You missed her
"everyone sucks but me" speech.

29:00.772 --> 29:02.775
If she's so superior,
let her find her own way back.

29:02.808 --> 29:04.977
Anya, the First is already
up and running.

29:05.010 --> 29:07.145
Every second that Buffy's
not here is an opportunity

29:07.179 --> 29:08.780
for it to show up
and rip us to pieces.

29:08.815 --> 29:11.717
Willow, how would
you get Buffy back?

29:11.750 --> 29:13.986
That's what I'm saying.
I don't even know.

29:14.019 --> 29:17.489
Okay, but if another witch
was to do it, where would
she start?

29:17.522 --> 29:19.991
Physics,
principles, basic laws.

29:20.026 --> 29:23.261
-Such as?
-Uh, conservation of energies.

29:23.295 --> 29:26.798
You can't really create
or destroy anything,
just transfer.

29:26.833 --> 29:29.000
-(scoffs)
-DAWN: I'm sorry.
Are you helping?

29:29.035 --> 29:32.070
No. But at least
I'm not galloping off
in the wrong direction.

29:32.104 --> 29:35.141
-Magic works off physics.
-Not without a catalyst.

29:35.173 --> 29:37.977
If you're talking
about transferring energies,
you need some kind of conduit.

29:38.009 --> 29:39.778
Like a-- a Kraken's tooth.

29:39.811 --> 29:44.450
Yeah. Skin of Draconis,
uh, ground-up Baltic stones.
Something.

29:44.482 --> 29:47.153
-Okay. Good.
-Plus, we need an exchange.

29:47.185 --> 29:49.654
Like you said, I'm thinking
a Slayer for a demon.

29:49.688 --> 29:52.523
Right.
If we want Buffy back,

29:52.557 --> 29:55.260
then we have to find that demon
and send it through.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.864
-It matter if it's
dead or alive?
-SPIKE: I vote dead.

30:00.699 --> 30:02.800
The Slayer's
countin' on you, Willow.

30:02.835 --> 30:07.105
Get crackin' on that portal,
and don't be stingy
with the mojo.

30:07.138 --> 30:09.508
-The demon's mine.
-I hate to say it, Big Bad,

30:09.540 --> 30:12.344
but you look like
you can barely stand.

30:12.377 --> 30:14.779
We're trained. And the only
thing we know for sure...

30:14.813 --> 30:17.449
about this demon is
it kicked your ass.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.852
It did at that.

30:21.220 --> 30:22.587
Where are you going?

30:24.022 --> 30:26.758
There's something
I need. (sighs)

30:33.265 --> 30:35.334
Hello?

30:35.366 --> 30:38.470
I'm Buffy.
I'm the Slayer.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.838
(speaking foreign language)

30:50.016 --> 30:52.151
Good. That's good then.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.886
Um, you know, I know we have
bigger issues to deal with,

30:54.921 --> 30:58.023
but how'd I understand
anything you guys just said?

30:58.057 --> 31:02.161
Oh, I know. Ancient magics.
I just thought it was neat.

31:02.193 --> 31:04.462
(speaking foreign language)

31:08.599 --> 31:11.269
And the neat of it just left.
Uh, end of what?

31:15.641 --> 31:18.743
Uh, latest. You mean,
"latest guardian."

31:19.945 --> 31:21.613
Okay, um--

31:21.646 --> 31:25.416
I-I have a First to fight, okay?
So just tell me what
I need to know.

31:25.451 --> 31:26.952
I-I came to learn.

31:31.457 --> 31:33.892
You know what I think?
I'm not really here at all.

31:33.925 --> 31:36.761
None of this
is actually happening.
This is like a play.

31:36.795 --> 31:39.030
Like some shadow play.

31:39.065 --> 31:42.468
Some nonreality,
reenactment, hologramy--

31:45.938 --> 31:47.806
KENNEDY:
And this is gonna help us how?

31:47.838 --> 31:50.776
The sand forms a circle,
the circle acts as a barrier,

31:50.808 --> 31:52.677
and the barrier
contains the portal.

31:54.313 --> 31:57.950
Now what?
We hold hands and chant
"kumbaya" or something?

31:57.983 --> 32:00.486
Maybe. Till we get
the magics up and running,

32:00.519 --> 32:03.154
I'm kind of workin'
on my best guess here.

32:05.023 --> 32:07.058
-XANDER:
Well, maybe we should wait.
-For what?

32:07.093 --> 32:09.060
Spike. To see if he can
bring back that demon.

32:09.095 --> 32:11.896
No, I-I don't think we
should wait right now.

32:11.930 --> 32:15.467
Opening a portal this size
could take days.

32:15.500 --> 32:18.604
Better get started.

32:18.636 --> 32:20.306
I think I might
pee my pants.

32:20.338 --> 32:24.109
You can do it. The magics,
not the pants thing.

32:24.143 --> 32:25.544
Okay.

32:30.615 --> 32:32.183
(exhales)

32:32.218 --> 32:35.153
(speaking Latin)

32:47.965 --> 32:51.403
Dawnie, you'd better
put on some coffee.
This could take a while.

32:52.703 --> 32:54.472
(screaming)

33:01.212 --> 33:03.182
What is this?

33:10.521 --> 33:12.923
(speaking foreign language)

33:20.231 --> 33:22.534
I thought I brought me here.

33:22.567 --> 33:26.471
Look, listen, you guys.
I'm already the Slayer,
bursting with power.

33:26.505 --> 33:27.538
Really don't need any more.

33:32.111 --> 33:34.246
(drum beats)

34:08.480 --> 34:10.282
This is how you--

34:35.072 --> 34:36.306
No!

34:39.411 --> 34:41.146
By making me less human?

34:52.023 --> 34:55.494
(grunting)

35:01.132 --> 35:02.333
(screaming)

35:20.186 --> 35:22.153
Make this stop!

35:24.722 --> 35:26.625
No, this isn't the way!

35:47.713 --> 35:49.780
-Where you goin'?
-Got a job.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.217
Nice coat. Where'd you get it?

35:51.250 --> 35:52.550
New York.

35:58.088 --> 36:01.025
(speaking Latin)

36:04.061 --> 36:07.666
Screw it! Mighty forces,
I suck at Latin, okay?

36:07.699 --> 36:10.235
But that's not the issue!
I'm the one in charge,

36:10.268 --> 36:13.070
and I'm telling you,
open that portal now!

36:13.103 --> 36:15.507
-It's not happening, Wil!
-Give her time.
She's getting it.

36:15.541 --> 36:18.043
Or something's getting her.
Wil, I think you'd better
back up a little.

36:18.076 --> 36:20.110
No!

36:31.922 --> 36:35.393
Oh, come on, now, Nancy.
Call yourself a demon?

36:35.427 --> 36:37.094
I thought you were up
for a proper fight.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.467
-Now we're talkin'.
-(growls)

37:01.320 --> 37:02.820
(shouting)

37:08.594 --> 37:11.563
(laughing)

37:11.597 --> 37:13.731
Yeah!

37:13.764 --> 37:17.436
You think I came all this way
to get knocked up
by some demon dust?

37:17.469 --> 37:19.405
I can't fight this.

37:19.438 --> 37:23.909
I know that now.
You guys, you're just men--

37:24.976 --> 37:28.313
Just the men who did this...
to her.

37:28.347 --> 37:30.248
Whoever that girl was before
she was the first Slayer.

37:31.650 --> 37:34.719
No, you don't understand!
You violated that girl,

37:34.753 --> 37:36.922
made her kill for you
because you're weak,

37:36.954 --> 37:40.759
you're pathetic,
and you obviously have
nothing to show me!

37:58.510 --> 38:00.811
(bones crack)

38:07.652 --> 38:09.920
I don't know your feelings,
big guy,

38:09.954 --> 38:13.525
but to me,
a tussle like that...

38:21.333 --> 38:23.835
is good for the soul.

38:33.043 --> 38:34.813
I knew it.
It's always the staff.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.684
Tell me something I don't know.

38:50.695 --> 38:52.931
(grunting)

39:35.706 --> 39:37.708
Hey.

39:39.244 --> 39:42.947
You okay? You've been
kind of quiet since--

39:42.981 --> 39:44.882
You sucked
the life out of me?

39:44.916 --> 39:48.186
Yeah. Since then.

39:48.219 --> 39:53.425
Look, it's important
that you know... what I am,

39:53.458 --> 39:56.628
what I'm like when I'm...
like that.

39:58.163 --> 40:03.101
I thought it would be--
I don't know-- cool somehow.

40:03.134 --> 40:04.603
It just hurt.

40:04.635 --> 40:07.304
Yeah. I'm really sorry.

40:07.338 --> 40:11.742
It's just, you were the most
powerful person nearby,

40:11.777 --> 40:15.179
and, well, that's--
that's how it works.

40:16.614 --> 40:19.451
That's... how I work.

40:20.985 --> 40:24.822
I got that. You told me.

40:30.427 --> 40:32.329
I'll see you in the morning.

40:46.811 --> 40:48.780
How you doin'?

40:50.882 --> 40:54.018
Thanks for
bringing me back... again.

40:54.052 --> 40:55.954
Oh, it's what I do.

40:58.322 --> 41:01.126
I was hard
on you guys today.

41:01.159 --> 41:03.293
Oh, it's all right.
You needed to be.

41:03.327 --> 41:07.498
Although, Twinkies and Kisses--
also peachy motivational tools.

41:09.867 --> 41:11.769
You okay?

41:11.802 --> 41:15.172
I think I made a mistake.

41:15.206 --> 41:18.043
What?

41:18.076 --> 41:20.378
Those men that I met--
you know, the shadow men--

41:22.146 --> 41:24.481
they offered me more power,

41:25.583 --> 41:27.853
but I didn't like the loophole.

41:27.885 --> 41:29.855
So you turned it down?

41:31.757 --> 41:35.492
It's okay, Buffy.
We'll get by. We always do.

41:37.362 --> 41:39.329
I don't know.

41:40.865 --> 41:44.402
-They showed me--
-Showed you what?

41:45.836 --> 41:48.472
That the first Slayer was right.

41:48.505 --> 41:50.041
It isn't enough.

41:50.074 --> 41:52.543
Why, Buffy?
What did you see?

41:55.847 --> 41:57.715
What did they show you?

42:00.786 --> 42:03.554
(growling)

42:41.092 --> 42:42.960
Grr! Arrgh!
