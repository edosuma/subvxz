WEBVTT

00:00.510 --> 00:03.170
back we are dating robin and i had this running joke.

00:03.180 --> 00:05.700
we were the only two people in the world who found it funny

00:05.710 --> 00:07.040
no way.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.910
march does not have 31 days.

00:08.920 --> 00:09.940
yes, it does.

00:09.950 --> 00:11.280
everyone knows that.

00:11.290 --> 00:13.010
it's like general knowledge.

00:13.020 --> 00:15.280
general knowledge. general knowledge.

00:15.290 --> 00:16.750
and we did it all the time.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.120
isn't it sad?

00:18.130 --> 00:19.690
i mean in 2007,

00:19.700 --> 00:22.860
some countries actually still condone corporal punishment.

00:22.870 --> 00:24.620
corporal punishment. corporal punishment.

00:24.630 --> 00:26.130
because once you start

00:26.140 --> 00:27.890
it's surprisingly hard to stop

00:27.900 --> 00:30.730
oh, man, i got a kernel stuck in my teeth.

00:30.740 --> 00:33.230
colonel stuck-in-my-teeth.

00:33.240 --> 00:34.970
please stop! i hate you!you're killing me!

00:34.980 --> 00:37.500
but now, we were broken up,so when marshall said...

00:37.510 --> 00:40.440
but after the first year,i get a major pay raise.

00:40.450 --> 00:42.980
we just let it slide.

00:42.990 --> 00:44.580
you see, on the surface,robin and i looked like

00:44.590 --> 00:45.580
we were doing great.

00:45.590 --> 00:47.480
but the truth is,

00:47.490 --> 00:48.750
trying to be friends with your ex

00:48.760 --> 00:50.180
is a lot harder than it looks

00:50.190 --> 00:52.050
you can't be as candid as you used to be

00:52.060 --> 00:54.120
so then this hot intern leans over my desk,

00:54.130 --> 00:56.990
i can totally see she has a pierced...

00:57.000 --> 00:58.460
brosnan.

00:58.470 --> 01:01.160
pierce brosnan is my favorite of all the bonds.

01:01.170 --> 01:04.629
but most importantly, you can never, ever be alone together.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.030
i gotta go.

01:06.040 --> 01:09.710
-i'm gonna go pay.  -peeing.

01:12.680 --> 01:13.970
i'm gonna help marshall pay.

01:13.980 --> 01:17.250
i'm gonna help lily pee.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074

all right,we have a turkey.

01:30.970 --> 01:32.320
yeah, we do.

01:32.330 --> 01:33.660
isn't this exciting?

01:33.670 --> 01:36.030
our first thanksgiving together as a group.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.330
yeah, this is gonna be the best slapsgiving ever.

01:38.340 --> 01:39.330
what?

01:39.340 --> 01:40.730
i said this is going to be

01:40.740 --> 01:42.600
the best thanksgiving ever

01:42.610 --> 01:44.270
yeah, this is going to be great.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.240
just the five of us, right?

01:46.250 --> 01:47.710
oh, uh, that reminds me: i invited bob.

01:47.720 --> 01:49.040
bob?

01:49.050 --> 01:51.040
you've been on, like,three dates with that guy.

01:51.050 --> 01:52.540
we haven't even met him.

01:52.550 --> 01:54.850
well, he didn't have anywhere else to go,

01:54.860 --> 01:56.280
and i didn't know what to say.

01:56.290 --> 01:57.880
is it really that big a deal?

01:57.890 --> 01:58.850
yes.

01:58.860 --> 02:00.420
this is our first thanksgiving.

02:00.430 --> 02:02.720
30 years from now, we're going to look at the photos

02:02.730 --> 02:07.190
and say, "oh,  there's the four people i love most in the world.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.729
and bob."

02:08.740 --> 02:10.360
i'm sorry,sometimes i forget

02:10.370 --> 02:12.700
how seriously you guys take american thanksgiving.

02:12.710 --> 02:14.730
real thanksgiving happened over a month ago.

02:14.740 --> 02:16.740
i'm sorry.

02:16.750 --> 02:19.370
did you just say canadian thanksgiving was

02:19.380 --> 02:22.240
and i'm quoting,"the real thanksgiving"?

02:22.250 --> 02:26.750
what do canadians even have to celebrate about?

02:26.760 --> 02:28.610
canadian thanksgiving

02:28.620 --> 02:31.380
celebrates explorer martin frobisher's valiant

02:31.390 --> 02:33.790
yet ultimately unsuccessful attempt

02:33.800 --> 02:35.550
to find the northwest passage.

02:35.560 --> 02:38.190
why are you guys even a country?

02:38.200 --> 02:39.630
oh, hey, by the way,

02:39.640 --> 02:41.260
if anyone wants to come over early thursday,

02:41.270 --> 02:42.960
we can watch the slapsgiving day parade.

02:42.970 --> 02:44.600
well,there,you said it again.

02:44.610 --> 02:45.300
said what?

02:45.310 --> 02:46.270
slapsgiving.

02:46.280 --> 02:48.400
oh, i guess i did.

02:48.410 --> 02:52.400
you know why? i've invented a new holiday: slapsgiving.

02:52.410 --> 02:53.940
it's the one day we set aside each year

02:53.950 --> 02:56.980
to gather together and give slaps.

02:56.990 --> 02:58.280
i should explain

02:58.290 --> 03:00.010
kids, you remember the slap bet

03:00.020 --> 03:02.550
a year earlier, marshall made a bet with barney

03:02.560 --> 03:04.620
and won the right to slap him five times

03:04.630 --> 03:07.350
he had already used the first

03:07.360 --> 03:09.990
and the second.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.690
but marshall had something special in store for the third

03:12.700 --> 03:14.090
slapcountdown.com.

03:14.100 --> 03:15.860
no.

03:15.870 --> 03:16.830
no, no.

03:16.840 --> 03:19.300
the countdown ends at 3:00 p.m.

03:19.310 --> 03:20.800
the day after thanksgiving.

03:20.810 --> 03:22.000
i counted it out.

03:22.010 --> 03:23.640
how many days are in october?

03:23.650 --> 03:25.800
uh, thirty.

03:25.810 --> 03:29.310
dude, i thought we cleared this up last year.

03:29.320 --> 03:32.010
i like halloween very much.

03:32.020 --> 03:34.110
is nice.

03:34.120 --> 03:35.480
is also tomorrow.

03:35.490 --> 03:38.160
damn it!

03:38.390 --> 03:41.150
wait, you're gonna slap me on thanksgiving?

03:41.160 --> 03:42.050
slapsgiving.

03:42.060 --> 03:43.820
that's not allowed.

03:43.830 --> 03:46.530
lily, you're the slap bet commissioner, is that allowed?

03:46.540 --> 03:48.990
the hostess in me who's using her wedding china

03:49.000 --> 03:51.430
for the first time wants to say hell, no,

03:51.440 --> 03:53.630
but yeah,i'm going to allow it.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.330
well, you know what?

03:55.340 --> 03:57.100
if you're trying to freak me out

03:57.110 --> 03:58.270
about spending thanksgiving...

03:58.280 --> 03:59.270
slapsgiving.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.510
at your place, then you failed.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.480
truth is, i'm not scared.

04:03.490 --> 04:05.710
-really?-right.cause you blew it.

04:05.720 --> 04:07.550
hmm.the worst part about getting slapped

04:07.560 --> 04:09.250
is not knowing when it's going to happen.

04:09.260 --> 04:11.550
but now i know exactly when i'm gonna get slapped.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.850
so, you took all the suspense out.

04:13.860 --> 04:16.120
you showed your hand.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.560
and thursday at 3:01 p.m.,

04:18.570 --> 04:23.000
your face is going to show my hand.

04:23.010 --> 04:24.700
oh, there's bob!

04:24.710 --> 04:26.230
by the way, heads up, he's a little bit older than us.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.130
how old is he?

04:27.140 --> 04:28.300
he's forty-one.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.130
hey, bob!

04:29.140 --> 04:31.040
over here!

04:31.050 --> 04:33.840
okay, kids, the truth is,bob probably looked like this.

04:33.850 --> 04:36.540
-hey, sweetie.-hi.

04:36.550 --> 04:38.440
but when your ex is dating someone new

04:38.450 --> 04:40.910
your mind tends to accentuate their flaws.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.510
this is how i saw bob.

04:42.520 --> 04:44.750
hey, dudes,what's crackin'?.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.090
-hey  -hey, man, how are you?

04:46.100 --> 04:46.920
good to meet you.

04:46.930 --> 04:48.120
sorry i'm late.

04:48.130 --> 04:49.660
i just got off the phone with my parents.

04:49.670 --> 04:50.960
parents?

04:50.970 --> 04:52.690
they were totally on my case:

04:52.700 --> 04:54.430
"what are you gonna do with your life? you're forty-one."

04:54.440 --> 04:58.960
and i'm like, "chillax,snowboarding is a legit career.

04:58.970 --> 05:02.030
you ought to be stoked i found my bliss."

05:02.040 --> 05:06.550
and speaking of bliss,sugar me, baby.

05:07.220 --> 05:09.850
let's go get a drink.

05:12.820 --> 05:14.210
unbelievable.

05:14.220 --> 05:17.450
robin is dating orville redenbacher.

05:17.460 --> 05:19.490
what are you talking about?

05:19.500 --> 05:21.820
he's forty-one.he looks great.

05:21.830 --> 05:23.190
yeah, du he's in pretty good shape.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.490
he could kick your ass.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.230
how are you guys not seeing this?

05:26.240 --> 05:28.230
he's 150; robin's 27.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.730
barney, come on,what do you got?

05:29.740 --> 05:32.100
nothing but respect for that man.

05:32.110 --> 05:35.530
oh, by the way, we're all baking pies at robin's tomorrow.

05:35.540 --> 05:38.970
marshall can't be trusted in the apartment with pies overnight.

05:38.980 --> 05:40.740
for the millionth time,

05:40.750 --> 05:46.750
sleep-eating is a very serious and delicious medical condition.

05:46.760 --> 05:48.750
hey, uh, what time are you guys going to robin's?

05:48.760 --> 05:49.820
7:30.

05:49.830 --> 05:51.380
perfect.

05:51.390 --> 05:54.660
just to be safe,i'll get there like 8:00, 8:30.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.590
sorry i'm late.

05:56.600 --> 05:57.560
where are marshall and lily?

05:57.570 --> 05:59.190
uh, they just called.

05:59.200 --> 06:02.940
they're both super swamped preparing for tomorrow.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.140
is bob coming?

06:10.150 --> 06:12.040
no, he went to see green day.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.040
so it's...

06:15.050 --> 06:16.410
-...just the two of us.  -...just the two of us.

06:16.420 --> 06:18.010
making pies.

06:18.020 --> 06:19.380
pies. they're things that friends make together.

06:19.390 --> 06:21.650
yeah, they do.

06:21.660 --> 06:22.980
-great. -yeah.

06:22.990 --> 06:24.420
great. well, this is great.

06:24.430 --> 06:28.800
-it'll give us a chance to catch up.  -yeah.

06:30.330 --> 06:33.970
-i'm going to make a phone call. -i'll put it in the oven.

06:34.540 --> 06:36.160
hey, it's me.

06:36.170 --> 06:38.130
listen, you have to come over here and make pies.

06:38.140 --> 06:40.130
yeah, i'll be there, absolutely.

06:40.140 --> 06:41.630
oh, awesome, you're a lifesaver.

06:41.640 --> 06:43.540
it's still kind of weird being alone with robin,

06:43.550 --> 06:44.940
but if you were here...

06:44.950 --> 06:46.310
hey, say no more.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.670
i mean, when i pulled

06:47.680 --> 06:49.340
you out of that burning wreckage,

06:49.350 --> 06:51.040
i wasn't doing it to have a battleship named after me.

06:51.050 --> 06:52.540
but if you insist,

06:52.550 --> 06:54.580
yes, i'll be there for the christening.

06:54.590 --> 06:57.120
you're hitting on someone right now, aren't you?

06:57.130 --> 06:59.220
no, i'm not going to wear the medal of honor.

06:59.230 --> 07:01.420
that would just be tacky.

07:01.430 --> 07:02.660
so you're not coming to make pies.

07:02.670 --> 07:03.920
no, no.

07:03.930 --> 07:05.420
thank you, mr. president.

07:05.430 --> 07:07.530
sorry.

07:07.540 --> 07:10.630
after a very long night, it was finally the big holiday.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.730
sorry, the two big holidays.

07:12.740 --> 07:13.870
oh, marshall,

07:13.880 --> 07:15.530
are you working on the cranberry sauce?

07:15.540 --> 07:18.540
in a minute, baby. i've only got so many hands.

07:18.550 --> 07:20.570
you see what i got going on here?

07:20.580 --> 07:22.370
they're turkeys, but they're also hands,

07:22.380 --> 07:24.840
because later, we're going to eat turkey...

07:24.850 --> 07:27.380
and then i'm going to slap you in your face.

07:27.390 --> 07:30.950
please, you took out all the suspense.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.750
in a horror movie,

07:32.760 --> 07:34.290
the killer does not grab a bullhorn and announce,

07:34.300 --> 07:37.360
"attention unsupervised teens here at the lake house:

07:37.370 --> 07:38.890
"at precisely 3:00 a.m.,

07:38.900 --> 07:41.090
"i'm gonna jump out of that closet right there

07:41.100 --> 07:42.800
"and hack you all up with a machete.

07:42.810 --> 07:46.240
p.s. fire is my one weakness."

07:49.380 --> 07:51.140
hey, ted.

07:51.150 --> 07:52.810
-hey, happy thanksgiving.  -you, too.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.210
is lily in the kitchen?

07:54.220 --> 07:56.950
-yep.  -great.

07:58.150 --> 07:59.180
-marshall?  -lily?

07:59.190 --> 08:00.780
-yeah?  -uh-huh?

08:00.790 --> 08:04.930
something really weird happened last night.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.200
what do you mean something weird happened last night?

08:07.210 --> 08:08.800
you may not realize this, but since we broke up,

08:08.810 --> 08:11.030
robin and i have never really been alone together.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.500
so we're in the kitchen,

08:12.510 --> 08:14.570
starting on the pies, and we realize,

08:14.580 --> 08:16.640
we don't have a damn thing to say to each other.

08:16.650 --> 08:18.210
i mean, you can't talk about

08:18.220 --> 08:19.840
how close you used to be.

08:19.850 --> 08:21.080
you can't talk about how close

08:21.090 --> 08:22.650
you're not now.

08:22.660 --> 08:24.010
you just feel like everything you say

08:24.020 --> 08:25.350
is gonna make things worse.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.520
exactly. and you know why?

08:27.530 --> 08:29.920
because you don't want to hurt someone you really care about,

08:29.930 --> 08:31.590
especially around the holidays.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.220
i mean, what decent human being would want to cause

08:34.230 --> 08:36.890
any kind of emotional or physical pain...

08:36.900 --> 08:39.340
you're still getting slapped.

08:39.470 --> 08:40.860
i wanted to leave, but i couldn't stick her

08:40.870 --> 08:42.530
with making all the pies by herself.

08:42.539 --> 08:44.230
she was exhausted.

08:44.240 --> 08:46.900
i yawned like a million times trying to get him to leave.

08:46.910 --> 08:49.270
yeah, some people just can't take a hint.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.070
by the way, i'm really swamped in here.

08:51.080 --> 08:52.710
i kept looking at the clock and sighing--

08:52.720 --> 08:54.410
totally clueless.

08:54.420 --> 08:55.880
uh-huh. i'm not sure i have time to mash

08:55.890 --> 08:58.080
those potatoes, you're standing right next to.

08:58.090 --> 08:59.850
and then ted does the thing that he always does

08:59.860 --> 09:01.380
when there's an awkward silence.

09:01.390 --> 09:02.920
yep. masher's right there, next to the pot.

09:02.930 --> 09:05.990
he panics and says the first thing that pops into his head.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.790
hey, did you know that

09:07.800 --> 09:12.670
the first pies in recorded history came from ancient egypt?

09:13.270 --> 09:15.770
remember last year's thanksgiving,

09:15.780 --> 09:19.740
when we had sex seven times?

09:19.910 --> 09:21.900
-ooh. terrible.  -what?!

09:21.910 --> 09:23.570
i thought it would break the ice.

09:23.580 --> 09:25.880
i'd already broken the ice with my cool pie fact.

09:25.890 --> 09:28.680
then he makes it ten times more awkward.

09:28.690 --> 09:31.150
how do you respond to something like that?

09:31.160 --> 09:34.380
did you know that the egyptian pyramids can be seen from space?

09:34.390 --> 09:37.050
probably?

09:37.060 --> 09:39.490
ooh, the oven's pre-heated!

09:39.500 --> 09:40.890
okay, um...

09:40.900 --> 09:43.490
the pecan pie is gonna take the longest.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.560
why don't we put that one in first?

09:45.570 --> 09:47.700
pecan pie? why are we making that?

09:47.710 --> 09:49.500
um, it's my favorite.

09:49.510 --> 09:51.170
you're allergic.

09:51.180 --> 09:53.640
i know. i just like smelling it.

09:53.650 --> 09:55.540
it's like eating with your nose.

09:55.550 --> 10:00.490
so we're making a pie for bob.

10:00.790 --> 10:02.310
yeah.

10:02.320 --> 10:04.910
she's got you making pies for this guy?

10:04.920 --> 10:06.580
yeah.

10:06.590 --> 10:10.200
that is a real slap in the face.

10:10.530 --> 10:13.160
you know, you could have just told me it was for bob.

10:13.170 --> 10:15.560
yeah, i-i just thought it might upset you.

10:15.570 --> 10:17.460
upset me? wait a second.

10:17.470 --> 10:20.340
do you think that...

10:20.410 --> 10:23.900
...do you think that i'm jealous of bob?

10:23.910 --> 10:25.370
i don't know.

10:25.380 --> 10:27.240
is it so ridiculous to think that you might be?

10:27.250 --> 10:29.070
-yes.  -why?

10:29.080 --> 10:31.310
because he's a thousand years old.

10:31.320 --> 10:34.110
no, ted, what are you doing?

10:34.120 --> 10:35.480
right?

10:35.490 --> 10:36.880
the only reason i'm jealous of bob

10:36.890 --> 10:38.480
is that we can only talk about the first thanksgiving,

10:38.490 --> 10:39.880
but he was actually there.

10:39.890 --> 10:40.780
come on.

10:40.790 --> 10:41.780
the only reason

10:41.790 --> 10:43.190
i'm jealous of bob is because

10:43.200 --> 10:44.720
i heard noah gave him shotgun in the ark.

10:44.730 --> 10:45.420
ted...

10:45.430 --> 10:46.360
the only reason

10:46.370 --> 10:47.760
i'm jealous of bob

10:47.770 --> 10:49.790
is that i'm just an architect, but he discovered fire.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.160
how do you top that?

10:51.170 --> 10:54.230
he's 41! why are you bashing on him so hard?

10:54.240 --> 10:56.070
i'm not. i'm just joking around.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.000
that's what friends do.

10:58.010 --> 10:59.540
it's mean.

10:59.550 --> 11:01.440
well, how come we're all allowed to bust on barney

11:01.450 --> 11:03.110
when he dates some skanktron,

11:03.120 --> 11:04.870
but when you sleep with the crypt keeper's dad,

11:04.880 --> 11:06.480
i'm not allowed to say a word?

11:06.490 --> 11:09.280
first of all, bob and i are not sleeping together.

11:09.290 --> 11:10.650
we're just dating.

11:10.660 --> 11:12.250
secondly, have i said one word

11:12.260 --> 11:14.450
about the parade of dubious conquests

11:14.460 --> 11:16.320
you've been marching past me the last few months?

11:16.330 --> 11:18.690
one of whom got you a butterfly tattoo?

11:18.700 --> 11:20.820
-hey, that is...-and if you and i are such good friends...

11:20.830 --> 11:23.630
why is baking a pie for bob so weird?

11:23.640 --> 11:25.260
yeah, if you and i are such good friends,

11:25.270 --> 11:28.230
why couldn't you just tell me that's what we were doing?

11:28.240 --> 11:30.570
okay, maybe we should talk about this later.

11:30.580 --> 11:33.200
i-i should get going.

11:33.210 --> 11:35.770
well, what are we doing?it's thanksgiving.

11:35.780 --> 11:36.870
i don't know. i'm sorry.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.070
this is stupid.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.240
i'm sorry, too.

11:39.250 --> 11:40.240
of course we're friends.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.380
i'm glad we're friends.

11:41.390 --> 11:43.920
me, too.

11:51.770 --> 11:54.100
you guys slept together last night?

11:54.110 --> 11:56.130
that is a terrible idea!

11:56.140 --> 11:57.840
horrible idea.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.900
relapse five!

11:59.910 --> 12:01.370
that's where we high-five,

12:01.380 --> 12:03.910
then it's awkward for a little bit...

12:03.920 --> 12:06.180
and then we high-five again!

12:06.190 --> 12:07.480
what the hell were you doing?

12:07.490 --> 12:08.650
let's review:

12:08.660 --> 12:10.880
you and ted broke up six months ago

12:10.890 --> 12:12.650
-yep  -you're dating another man...

12:12.660 --> 12:14.320
you are correct, sir.

12:14.330 --> 12:15.650
...who's coming to my thanksgiving today...

12:15.660 --> 12:17.150
that is a truth-fact.

12:17.160 --> 12:19.520
-..an event ted is also attending.-ka-blammo.

12:19.530 --> 12:22.160
why are you trying to destroy american thanksgiving?!

12:22.170 --> 12:24.000
oh, lily, it's not as bad as it sounds.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.630
bob and i aren't that serious,

12:25.640 --> 12:28.630
and what happened last night with ted was a fluke.

12:28.640 --> 12:32.680
well, did you guys at least talk about it?

12:35.350 --> 12:38.940
-there's office material...-i hear something burning...

12:38.950 --> 12:40.680
clearly, we need to ignore this.

12:40.690 --> 12:43.210
clearly, we need  to talk about this.

12:43.220 --> 12:47.090
you know? to save the friendship.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.750
-we need to talk.-stuffed mushroom?

12:49.760 --> 12:51.560
we need to talk about last night.

12:51.570 --> 12:54.060
did you know that some mushrooms are carnivorous?

12:54.070 --> 12:56.960
probably... not?

12:56.970 --> 12:59.800
ted, can we please just deal with this?

12:59.810 --> 13:01.600
look, i'm not mad.

13:01.610 --> 13:02.800
-i just think...-wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:02.810 --> 13:04.640
why would you be mad-- you started it?

13:04.650 --> 13:06.240
what?! you're crazy!

13:06.250 --> 13:08.110
we called a truce, we hugged,

13:08.120 --> 13:10.610
and when i tried to pull away,  you kept your hand on my neck.

13:10.620 --> 13:12.740
only because your hand was still around my waist.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.710
oh, come on! you leaned into it.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.880
-i... leaned into it?-yeah.

13:16.890 --> 13:18.780
you're like the crappy kid in little league

13:18.790 --> 13:20.020
who knows he's not going to make contact,

13:20.030 --> 13:22.390
so he just..."oops, i got hit by the pitch.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.120
better take my base."

13:24.130 --> 13:25.620
oh, that was you in little league, wasn't it?

13:25.630 --> 13:28.900
my on-base percentage was off the charts!

13:29.170 --> 13:30.390
oh, no!

13:30.400 --> 13:32.530
the slap-petizers.

13:32.540 --> 13:34.170
you know what? that's it!

13:34.180 --> 13:37.070
this is thanksgiving. solve this right now.

13:37.080 --> 13:41.470
and if you have sex again, neither of you gets dessert!

13:41.480 --> 13:45.210
oh, what the hell kind of thanksgiving is this anyway?

13:45.220 --> 13:47.040
um, most thanksgivings.

13:47.050 --> 13:48.350
don't stress, baby.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.850
i'll try to find us something relaxing.

13:49.860 --> 13:51.720
thanks, baby.

13:51.730 --> 13:54.390
ooh, some classical music, maybe.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.490
oh, my!

13:56.500 --> 13:57.860
look at that.

13:57.870 --> 14:00.590
that means we're in the final hour of the countdown.

14:00.600 --> 14:03.090
i'm not scared.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.330
then why is your right cheek twitching?

14:05.340 --> 14:07.030
it's not...

14:07.040 --> 14:10.070
maybe it's because future me slaps future you so hard,

14:10.080 --> 14:11.970
it reverberates back to the present,

14:11.980 --> 14:14.140
shattering the time-slap continuum.

14:14.150 --> 14:15.910
please don't slap me.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.410
i'm sorry, what?

14:17.420 --> 14:18.580
oh, god! don't slap me again!

14:18.590 --> 14:20.210
i don't want to get slapped again,

14:20.220 --> 14:22.050
and the first two times hurt so bad, i don't like it!

14:22.060 --> 14:24.850
i don't like it one bit!

14:24.860 --> 14:27.950
i thought i ruined it by putting a clock on it, barney?

14:27.960 --> 14:30.190
well, you didn't ruin it; you made it so much worse!

14:30.200 --> 14:31.490
i can't eat.

14:31.500 --> 14:32.990
i can't sleep.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.290
i've lost ten pounds; my suits are wearing me.

14:35.300 --> 14:37.230
you know what?i'm outta here.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.930
well, no, no, no. you can't leave.

14:38.940 --> 14:40.670
why can't i?!

14:40.680 --> 14:42.300
nowhere in the rules does it say that i have to sit

14:42.310 --> 14:43.930
through sort of mental torture!

14:43.940 --> 14:45.570
you are allowed to slap my face, sir,

14:45.580 --> 14:47.200
but you are not allowed to slap my mind!

14:47.210 --> 14:48.770
good day!

14:48.780 --> 14:50.940
-but it's slapsgiving.-no!it's not!

14:50.950 --> 14:53.540
it's thanksgiving!

14:53.550 --> 14:55.450
our first one as a married couple,

14:55.460 --> 14:57.180
as grownups--

14:57.190 --> 14:59.280
and you're not even trying to be a part of it!

14:59.290 --> 15:01.020
none of you are!

15:01.030 --> 15:03.220
so...

15:03.230 --> 15:05.260
as slap bet commissioner,i'm issuing a ruling.

15:05.270 --> 15:07.260
thanksgiving is a day of peace.

15:07.270 --> 15:08.860
there will be no slaps today!

15:08.870 --> 15:10.830
-what?!-yes!

15:10.840 --> 15:12.400
in your face!

15:12.410 --> 15:14.730
not my face... your face!

15:14.740 --> 15:16.630
-what's up, dudes? - all:hey, bob.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.040
-baby,please... -no!

15:18.050 --> 15:20.040
the slap bet commissioner's word is final,

15:20.050 --> 15:23.340
so get in the kitchen and mash some potatoes, now.

15:23.350 --> 15:26.040
and for the rest of the day,

15:26.050 --> 15:30.350
we are going to enjoy a civilized, grownup holiday.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.950
not too grownup.

15:31.960 --> 15:33.320
i made jell-o shots.

15:33.330 --> 15:37.400
we's gonna get silly, bitches.

15:37.730 --> 15:39.690
look at us!

15:39.700 --> 15:42.660
we can't be alone together, can we?

15:42.670 --> 15:44.930
apparently not.

15:44.940 --> 15:47.330
what does that mean?

15:47.340 --> 15:50.470
we're supposed to be friends.

15:50.480 --> 15:53.270
we aren't friends, are we?

15:53.280 --> 15:55.070
not really.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.770
we avoid each other.

15:56.780 --> 15:59.740
we smile politely.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.310
we're two people who pretend to be friends

16:01.320 --> 16:05.390
because it would be inconvenient not to.

16:06.030 --> 16:08.920
well, maybe we should stop pretending.

16:08.930 --> 16:13.400
maybe we should.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.260
so...

16:20.270 --> 16:22.430
oh, what do we do now?

16:22.440 --> 16:25.300
i suppose...

16:25.310 --> 16:27.240
we eat dinner.

16:27.250 --> 16:29.440
yeah.

16:29.450 --> 16:33.580
and then that's it.

16:33.590 --> 16:38.620
okay.

16:49.070 --> 16:52.610
happy thanksgiving.

16:54.610 --> 16:56.530
so we sat down to our first thanksgiving

16:56.540 --> 16:58.840
together as a group...and, apparently, our last.

16:58.850 --> 17:00.840
marshall,you're not eating.

17:00.850 --> 17:02.740
did something spoil

17:02.750 --> 17:06.050
your slap-petite?

17:06.490 --> 17:09.050
no, i just thought...before we eat,

17:09.060 --> 17:10.880
maybe the chef would like to say a few words.

17:10.890 --> 17:15.290
nope. this sucks.eat up and leave.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.660
well, then, i'd like to say something.

17:20.670 --> 17:22.060
if that's cool?

17:22.069 --> 17:26.530
um... today,lily did something great.

17:26.540 --> 17:29.300
not only did she gather us all here together

17:29.310 --> 17:31.000
and cook a delicious meal,

17:31.010 --> 17:33.240
but she also started a new tradition.

17:33.250 --> 17:35.610
we're gonna do this again next year,

17:35.620 --> 17:38.580
and the year after that-- maybe for the rest of our lives.

17:38.590 --> 17:41.080
i think that's pretty amazing if you think about it.

17:41.090 --> 17:44.520
and it's all thanks to you,lily.

17:44.530 --> 17:46.880
i love you.

17:46.890 --> 17:50.100
so, to the first of many thanksgivings together.

17:55.870 --> 17:57.660
this is rad!

17:57.670 --> 18:02.030
a nice, small,simple thanksgiving.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.630
i'm the youngest of ten in my family,

18:03.640 --> 18:07.100
so our thanksgiving is a mess.

18:07.110 --> 18:09.070
all the yelling and the screaming...

18:09.080 --> 18:11.710
and then a funny thing happened...

18:11.720 --> 18:14.310
it's really a major buzz-kill.

18:14.320 --> 18:17.220
-major buzz-kill.-major buzz-kill.

18:19.830 --> 18:21.120
oh, no...

18:21.130 --> 18:24.160
i thought we were done with that?

18:24.170 --> 18:26.090
i guess we're not.

18:26.100 --> 18:29.990
guess we're not.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.560
you see kids, friendship is an involuntary reflex--

18:33.570 --> 18:35.830
it just happens,you can't help it.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.640
that first thanksgiving turned out to be a wonderful dinner

18:38.650 --> 18:41.040
with the four people i love most in the world...

18:41.050 --> 18:43.310
and bob

18:43.320 --> 18:44.780
and it did become a tradition.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.380
that's why every year,we go to aunt lily

18:46.390 --> 18:48.150
and uncle marshall's for thanksgiving.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.810

18:49.820 --> 18:51.150
we're in the last 20 seconds

18:51.160 --> 18:53.680
of marshall's countdown to nothing.

18:53.690 --> 18:55.390
barney, put it away.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.920
how does it feel, marshall,to sit there, impotently--

18:57.930 --> 19:01.430
your large, flaccid hand,just dangling in the wind?

19:01.440 --> 19:04.300
the slap will occur in ten..

19:04.310 --> 19:06.030
ooh, classy touch, dude.

19:50.720 --> 19:54.710
you feel the blood rush to your cheek

19:54.720 --> 19:58.180

19:58.190 --> 19:59.680
