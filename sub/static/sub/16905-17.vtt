WEBVTT

00:02.404 --> 00:04.312
Jack, I've got a huge problem.

00:04.552 --> 00:05.497
The TGS sweatshirts were

00:05.617 --> 00:08.153
supposed to say
"TGS Season Six, Yuck,"

00:08.273 --> 00:10.672
which is a catch-phrase
from a pretty great sketch.

00:10.792 --> 00:12.776
Yuck!

00:12.811 --> 00:14.478
But they got misprinted
and now they say,

00:14.512 --> 00:16.230
"TGS Season Six, Duck!"

00:16.280 --> 00:18.232
And that's a season
five catchphrase.

00:18.283 --> 00:20.350
Duck!?

00:20.368 --> 00:22.069
Lemon,
that is not a real problem.

00:22.120 --> 00:25.155
A real problem is losing
your giant scissors

00:25.189 --> 00:27.825
right before a ribbon-cutting
for a couch factory.

00:27.859 --> 00:32.179
I just...had them.

00:32.213 --> 00:33.897
Oh, thank God.

00:33.915 --> 00:36.166
I thought I'd lost them.
Today...

00:36.201 --> 00:38.285
I want everything
to be perfect.

00:38.336 --> 00:39.553
I'm opening a factory.

00:39.587 --> 00:41.789
And factories
provide three things

00:41.840 --> 00:43.207
this country desperately needs:

00:43.241 --> 00:47.010
Jobs, pride, and material
for Bruce Springsteen songs.

00:47.045 --> 00:48.295
Great, so we solved
your problem,

00:48.329 --> 00:49.797
but now I've gotta wear
last year's sweatshirt

00:49.831 --> 00:51.581
to my cousin's wedding.

00:51.599 --> 00:54.417
Oh, I'm so tired.

00:54.436 --> 00:58.088
I was out all last night with my
new rock star boyfriend.

00:58.106 --> 00:59.940
Oh, I listened
to rock and roll music once,

00:59.974 --> 01:02.559
but I stopped before I started
worshipping the devil.

01:02.593 --> 01:05.779
The song went, "Mr. Sandma--",
then I shut it off.

01:05.814 --> 01:06.780
Morning, Jenna.

01:06.815 --> 01:08.115
Oh, thanks.

01:08.149 --> 01:10.234
Dating a musician is amazing.

01:10.268 --> 01:13.237
This sexual walkabout I'm on
is really opening me up

01:13.271 --> 01:15.372
- to new experiences.
- What's new?

01:15.406 --> 01:17.107
You've been with
tons of musicians.

01:17.125 --> 01:18.441
Back in Chicago,
I walked in on you

01:18.460 --> 01:20.327
with the guy from
blues traveler.

01:20.378 --> 01:22.779
He still had
his harmonica thing on.

01:22.797 --> 01:24.965
Sure, I've dated
musicians before.

01:24.999 --> 01:27.084
But I've never sexually
manipulated one

01:27.118 --> 01:28.969
into leaving his band for me.

01:29.003 --> 01:31.121
Like Yoko Ono and the Beatles,

01:31.139 --> 01:33.674
or Lance Drake Mandrell
and Wilson Phillips.

01:33.725 --> 01:36.760
My boyfriend's last album
went quadruple-platinum.

01:36.794 --> 01:39.813
They sold out Madison square
garden in nine minutes,

01:39.848 --> 01:41.464
for a Tuesday morning show.

01:41.483 --> 01:43.517
Wait, who plays on
a Tuesday morning?

01:43.568 --> 01:46.970
I don't know, just a little
band called the Woggels.

01:46.988 --> 01:48.655
♪ apples are red ♪

01:48.690 --> 01:50.157
♪ bananas are yellow ♪

01:50.191 --> 01:54.244
♪ I love my friends,
bananas are yellow ♪

01:54.279 --> 01:55.645
My Russ is the blue one.

01:55.663 --> 01:57.581
He's about to do
something amazing.

02:01.286 --> 02:03.453
Oh, I know the Woggels.

02:03.487 --> 02:05.322
My eight-year-old niece
walked down the aisle

02:05.340 --> 02:06.790
to that song at her wedding.

02:06.824 --> 02:09.258
Wait, you're trying to break
up a children's group?

02:09.294 --> 02:10.676
Well, it ticks off
a lot of boxes

02:10.711 --> 02:12.796
on my sexual walkabout list.

02:12.830 --> 02:13.997
"Yoko a band,

02:14.015 --> 02:16.850
"make love to a beloved
children's entertainer,

02:16.885 --> 02:19.019
be with a non-aboriginal
Australian--"

02:19.053 --> 02:20.437
I thought
the whole point of this

02:20.471 --> 02:21.939
was to see if someone could
make you happier than Paul.

02:21.973 --> 02:23.506
I mean, if you're
just checking off boxes,

02:23.525 --> 02:26.310
maybe you should get back
together before it's too late.

02:26.344 --> 02:27.361
What's that supposed to mean?

02:27.395 --> 02:29.146
He's not replacing me.

02:29.180 --> 02:30.614
We're having an adventure.

02:30.648 --> 02:32.566
And I hope right now he is also

02:32.617 --> 02:34.451
with a beloved
children's entertainer.

02:34.485 --> 02:35.786
Maybe Raffi.

02:35.820 --> 02:39.206
Or the sedated prisoner
they put inside of Barney.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.574
Something terrible
has happened!

02:40.625 --> 02:42.025
And for once
I'm not talking about

02:42.043 --> 02:46.863
the collapse of
the middle class.

02:46.881 --> 02:48.131
It's my family.

02:48.166 --> 02:50.167
My oldest son, George foreman,
got into Stanford,

02:50.201 --> 02:51.552
and he's planning to attend.

02:51.586 --> 02:53.870
Tracy, that's awesome.
Stanford's a great school.

02:53.888 --> 02:56.256
I didn't even get in,
and I was first in my class.

02:56.307 --> 02:58.141
Although, only seven of us
graduated that year

02:58.176 --> 03:00.043
because of a bad
mono outbreak which

03:00.061 --> 03:03.546
somehow missed me, despite
all the frenching I did.

03:03.565 --> 03:04.714
You don't understand.

03:04.732 --> 03:06.883
Jordan men don't go to college.

03:06.901 --> 03:09.186
We go to the school
of hard knocks,

03:09.220 --> 03:11.939
a one-year vocational program
where you learn to bang on doors

03:11.990 --> 03:14.024
and scare people into
subscribing to magazines

03:14.058 --> 03:15.909
- that they'll never get.
- Mr. Jordan,

03:15.944 --> 03:17.828
- you should be proud.
- Proud?

03:17.862 --> 03:19.496
My son's a nerd!

03:19.530 --> 03:20.597
Tracy, in the real world,

03:20.632 --> 03:22.349
you need a college degree
to succeed.

03:22.383 --> 03:23.584
Really, Dotcom?

03:23.618 --> 03:25.352
How did your city
council campaign go?

03:25.386 --> 03:27.688
Well, as far as raising the
level of discourse in this city?

03:27.722 --> 03:30.340
I'd say it was a great success.

03:30.375 --> 03:32.259
This is Angie's fault!
She coddled him.

03:32.293 --> 03:34.428
I'm gonna teach my son
what it is to be a Jordan.

03:34.462 --> 03:36.913
And I'm gonna die trying!

03:39.934 --> 03:50.486

Yes?

04:02.490 --> 04:03.707
Mr. Donaghy.

04:03.741 --> 04:05.292
This is Dr. Pravin Singh.

04:05.326 --> 04:07.461
I performed your mother's
heart surgery last month.

04:07.495 --> 04:09.246
No, you must have
the wrong Mr. Donaghy.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.048
My mother didn't have
heart surgery.

04:11.082 --> 04:12.299
Colleen Donaghy.

04:12.333 --> 04:16.103
Born April 24, 1925, at
Boston catholic guilt hospital.

04:16.137 --> 04:17.620
She keeps calling me Aladdin.

04:17.639 --> 04:18.889
That's definitely her.

04:18.923 --> 04:20.390
Well, she's recovering
very nicely,

04:20.425 --> 04:22.592
but we don't have anyone
to release her to.

04:22.626 --> 04:24.428
We found your name on
a list of disappointments

04:24.462 --> 04:25.962
she keeps folded up in her shoe.

04:25.980 --> 04:27.797
Well, doctor,
I can't come to the hospital

04:27.815 --> 04:28.832
to bring my mother home.

04:28.866 --> 04:30.300
I'm in New York, not Florida.

04:30.318 --> 04:32.803
Mr. Donaghy, I'm calling
you from Cornell medical center.

04:32.837 --> 04:34.637
My mother's in New York?

04:34.656 --> 04:37.424
Dr. Singh,
are you stealing my hats?

04:37.458 --> 04:39.743
What do you do,
feed them to your cow God?

04:39.777 --> 04:41.244
Mother, what are you doing?

04:41.279 --> 04:43.280
Who told you to call my son?

04:43.314 --> 04:45.949
Oh, please,
you wanted him to call.

04:45.983 --> 04:49.086
Somehow, you knew I was opening
a sofa factory today.

04:49.120 --> 04:51.021
- Could we just...
- Ooh, sofa.

04:51.055 --> 04:53.623
Somebody got all flouncy
when I wasn't looking.

04:53.657 --> 04:55.459
What are you gonna do,
put on your galoshes

04:55.493 --> 04:57.611
and go eat some fruit,
like a Frenchman?

04:57.645 --> 05:01.431
Fruit is part of a balanced
diet, you miserable harridan.

05:01.466 --> 05:04.601
Good God! You've ruined every
significant moment in my life.

05:04.635 --> 05:05.852
And now,

05:05.887 --> 05:08.055
- you've ruined this.
- Jack, for God's sake,

05:08.106 --> 05:10.173
there's only one reason
I came to New York,

05:10.191 --> 05:13.393
and that's because Gunga Din
here takes my insurance.

05:13.444 --> 05:15.028
So you were planning
on never telling me

05:15.063 --> 05:16.480
you were having heart surgery?

05:16.514 --> 05:17.564
Look, I do have other patients.

05:17.615 --> 05:19.516
Yes, I'm sure you do.

05:19.550 --> 05:21.764
Oh.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.563
Yes, I know it's over, Kouchie.

05:23.683 --> 05:25.758
Unlike you, I have eyes.

Okay, all right.

05:47.854 --> 05:48.821
Where do you think you're going?

05:48.855 --> 05:50.272
I'm with Russ, Ian.

05:50.307 --> 05:51.740
What?

05:51.791 --> 05:54.526
You afraid my sexuality
might tear this band apart?

05:54.544 --> 05:55.861
Listen here, Jenna.

05:55.879 --> 05:57.213
We're the Woggels.

05:57.247 --> 05:59.665
Nothing can tear us apart...

05:59.699 --> 06:04.620

a hold of the fifth woggel.

06:13.213 --> 06:15.798
So to help your mother's
weakened heart continue to beat,

06:15.832 --> 06:17.716
we implanted an "LVAD" device.

06:17.734 --> 06:18.884
Yes, I'm familiar with that.

06:18.902 --> 06:20.385
My good friend
dick Cheney got one.

06:20.403 --> 06:22.655
A month later, he and I
went hunting in Mexico.

06:22.689 --> 06:25.074
He shot thousands
of doves that day

06:25.108 --> 06:27.059
and only hit me in the leg once.

06:27.077 --> 06:29.695
So, you know that it runs
on rechargeable batteries?

06:29.729 --> 06:32.498
Like the flashlight in
my race war preparedness bag.

06:32.532 --> 06:33.866
Mrs. Donaghy,

06:33.900 --> 06:36.235
the fact that you didn't
call your son is worrisome.

06:36.253 --> 06:37.402
What good would he have been?

06:37.420 --> 06:39.371
He's useless in a hospital.

06:39.406 --> 06:41.824
I recall this one time

06:41.858 --> 06:43.409
he cried and cried.

06:43.443 --> 06:45.461
I mean,
it was more like wailing.

06:45.512 --> 06:47.012
It was awful.

06:47.047 --> 06:48.964
She's referring to my birth.

06:48.999 --> 06:50.716
Look, I know this
is a lot to process,

06:50.750 --> 06:53.219
so I'll leave you
two alone to talk.

06:53.253 --> 06:55.187
About what?

06:59.226 --> 07:02.344
Can you believe this is
the best room they have?

07:02.379 --> 07:04.563
This is supposed
to be a hospital,

07:04.597 --> 07:07.099
not a Japanese internment camp

07:07.117 --> 07:10.069
I volunteered at during the war.

07:10.103 --> 07:11.120
Well, if you're not happy here

07:11.154 --> 07:12.404
I could put you up at the Plaza.

07:12.438 --> 07:13.539
You could look out at the park

07:13.573 --> 07:15.958
and watch carriage
horses being whipped.

07:15.992 --> 07:17.293
I know how you love that.

07:17.327 --> 07:19.645
I can't go to the Plaza,
and you know it.

07:19.679 --> 07:21.247
What if I run into Eloise?

07:21.281 --> 07:24.300
Am I supposed not
to mention the fact

07:24.334 --> 07:27.303
that she has a gay grandson?

07:27.337 --> 07:28.887
Everybody knows!

07:28.922 --> 07:30.472
Well, then, of course
I'd love to have you stay

07:30.507 --> 07:32.057
- with me and Liddy.
- Liddy?

07:32.092 --> 07:34.626
Why couldn't you name
the baby after my mother?

07:34.644 --> 07:36.128
Because at Ellis island,

07:36.146 --> 07:41.633
your mother's name was recorded
as "unclaimed Irish stowaway."

07:42.635 --> 07:43.919
Son,

07:43.954 --> 07:45.137
we have a lot of work to do
today

07:45.155 --> 07:47.239
if I'm gonna
"reverse Urkel" you.

07:47.274 --> 07:48.640
Dad, I just want to read.

07:48.658 --> 07:50.326
Jordan men don't read.

07:50.360 --> 07:53.645
Grizz, tear this book in half.

07:53.663 --> 07:55.114
Son, I'm gonna show you

07:55.148 --> 07:57.583
how a real Jordan man
enjoys himself.

07:57.617 --> 07:59.001
It's montage time.

07:59.035 --> 08:01.987
Tray, montage got married
and quit stripping.

08:02.005 --> 08:03.822
Fine, we'll just do
a series of activities.

08:46.499 --> 08:49.385
Well, Colleen ruined
the ribbon-cutting.

08:49.419 --> 08:51.320
She's in New York.
She's been here for weeks,

08:51.354 --> 08:53.172
recovering from heart surgery.

08:53.206 --> 08:54.490
Oh, my God, is she okay?

08:54.524 --> 08:55.808
She's fine.

08:55.842 --> 08:57.876
They gave her the same heart
pump dick Cheney had.

08:57.911 --> 08:59.345
Next thing you know,
they'll be giving her

08:59.379 --> 09:01.930
his retractable wings
and rocket arms.

09:01.981 --> 09:03.399
She's going to bury us all.

09:03.433 --> 09:05.567
Jack, your mom's 87.

09:05.602 --> 09:07.770
Do you think maybe she had
the surgery in New York

09:07.821 --> 09:11.824
to be close to you, so you guys
could, you know, have the talk?

09:11.858 --> 09:13.225
"The talk"?

09:13.243 --> 09:16.412
Lemon, my mother did explain
sex to me, three years ago.

09:16.446 --> 09:18.364
There were...drawings.

09:18.398 --> 09:20.866
No, I mean,<i>the</i> talk.

09:20.900 --> 09:22.034
Your mom's heart doesn't work.

09:22.068 --> 09:23.869
You need to sit down
and say how you feel

09:23.903 --> 09:26.088
so you don't have any regrets.

09:26.122 --> 09:28.290
I've done it, Jack,
and it isn't easy,

09:28.341 --> 09:30.409
but it's very rewarding.

09:30.427 --> 09:32.895
You talk in your sleep.

09:32.929 --> 09:34.613
I know what you did in the war,

09:34.647 --> 09:38.517
and before you die,
I want you to know that I know.

09:38.551 --> 09:40.352
I know you Donaghys
think you're so tough,

09:40.387 --> 09:41.420
but Colleen is here
because she's trying

09:41.438 --> 09:42.871
to reach out to you.

09:42.906 --> 09:44.940
Just get in the same room
with her,

09:44.974 --> 09:47.142
and the talk will happen.

09:47.193 --> 09:49.194
I guar-on-tee.

09:49.229 --> 09:50.779
I don't know why I said that.

09:50.814 --> 09:52.231
This is such
a serious conversation.

09:52.265 --> 09:53.598
I'm sorry.

09:53.616 --> 09:55.284
Uh, Lemon, I assure you,

09:55.318 --> 09:57.870
my mother is not in New York
to spend time with me.

09:57.904 --> 09:59.538
She already wants
to leave my apartment

09:59.572 --> 10:01.540
because Liddy is
"giving her the stink eye."

10:06.279 --> 10:07.379
As soon as she feels up to it,

10:07.414 --> 10:09.548
she is going back to Florida.

10:09.582 --> 10:11.583
There was no need for us
to start jabbering

10:11.617 --> 10:13.302
about our feelings and sobbing

10:13.336 --> 10:15.387
like Bill Belichick
listening to Adele.

10:15.422 --> 10:16.388
Okay, fine.

10:16.423 --> 10:18.424
- But you and your mom--
- Nope.

10:18.458 --> 10:19.624
As my coffee cup
said this morning,

10:19.642 --> 10:21.894
"you only regret
the things you didn't do.

10:21.928 --> 10:23.795
This cup was made from
recycled toilet paper."

10:23.813 --> 10:26.148
Don't let Colleen leave without
saying what you need to say.

10:26.182 --> 10:27.566
- Last word.
- Damn it!

10:33.139 --> 10:37.309
♪ I'm a kangaroo,
I'm a kangaroo ♪

10:37.327 --> 10:40.829
- ♪ loot da doo da doo ♪
- What is that?

10:40.864 --> 10:42.748
Oh, it's nothing.

10:42.782 --> 10:44.500
It's just a song
I've been fiddling with.

10:44.534 --> 10:45.751
Or, as we say in Australia,

10:45.785 --> 10:47.169
a song I've been
fiddling wazzle.

10:47.203 --> 10:49.254
It's good.

10:49.289 --> 10:50.506
It's really good.

10:50.540 --> 10:52.090
And this is coming from someone

10:52.125 --> 10:54.676
Quincy Jones
once pushed off a boat.

10:54.711 --> 10:58.597
So, why does Ian write
all the songs?

10:58.631 --> 11:00.516
He's just keeping you down,

11:00.550 --> 11:04.553
because he knows you're
the real genius of the Woggels.

11:04.604 --> 11:05.554
Really?

11:05.605 --> 11:06.772
Do you think so, Jenna?

11:06.806 --> 11:09.174
It doesn't matter
what this brain thinks.

11:09.209 --> 11:14.196
It matters what
this brain thinks.

11:18.568 --> 11:20.285
- Lemon, there you are.
- Good morning, Jack.

11:20.320 --> 11:21.703
Did you talk to Colleen?

11:21.738 --> 11:24.239
If you're ordering me an edible
arrangement to say thanks,

11:24.290 --> 11:25.690
I'd prefer a meat one.

11:25.708 --> 11:27.209
Yes, Colleen and I did talk.

11:27.243 --> 11:29.962
Specifically, she said a car
was circling the block,

11:29.996 --> 11:32.130
"casing the house."

11:32.165 --> 11:34.633
I tried to explain that those
were all different taxi cabs,

11:34.667 --> 11:37.503
and she said, "then why is the
same man driving all of them,"

11:37.537 --> 11:38.704
and insisted on leaving.

11:38.738 --> 11:40.138
She won't go to a hotel,

11:40.173 --> 11:41.206
and she hates
the Princeton club,

11:41.224 --> 11:42.707
because Dean Cain
is always there

11:42.725 --> 11:45.260
hoping to get recognized.

11:45.311 --> 11:47.379
I tried to leave her
at the Bodies" exhibit--

11:47.397 --> 11:48.981
God, that is all
just a smoke screen.

11:49.015 --> 11:51.883
She's acting out because she
wants to have the conversation,

11:51.901 --> 11:53.485
and you won't meet her halfway.

11:53.520 --> 11:55.270
I decided something last night

11:55.321 --> 11:57.389
after I got your
tenth text message,

11:57.407 --> 11:59.525
one of which was
an inscrutable emoticon.

11:59.559 --> 12:00.526
Hold it sideways,

12:00.560 --> 12:01.893
it's me going like this:

12:01.911 --> 12:03.529
"Talk to your mother!"

12:03.563 --> 12:05.831
The "8" is my glasses.

12:05.865 --> 12:08.166
Yes, someday,
my mother is going to die,

12:08.201 --> 12:10.235
and we're going
to deal with it our way.

12:10.253 --> 12:11.286
Well, your way is wrong,

12:11.337 --> 12:14.957
and I bet Colleen
agrees with me.

12:15.008 --> 12:17.159
I'm glad you said that, Lemon.

12:17.193 --> 12:19.978
Good luck.

12:21.214 --> 12:22.414
Ah, Elizabeth.

12:22.448 --> 12:25.517
Can we do something about
the temperature in here?

12:25.552 --> 12:27.185
I'd like it humid and cold.

12:27.220 --> 12:28.270
Duck!

12:32.146 --> 12:33.513
Yoko announcement.

12:33.547 --> 12:35.348
Russ wrote a song.

12:35.382 --> 12:36.549
A great song.

12:36.567 --> 12:38.384
And if you don't sing
it at the Gwammys,

12:38.402 --> 12:41.737
which is the Grammys for
toddlers, Russ is going solo.

12:41.772 --> 12:44.240
Russ, I write the songs here,
so you have to choose.

12:44.274 --> 12:47.493
Her, or us?

12:47.528 --> 12:48.494
Come on, mate, Woggel power.

12:48.529 --> 12:50.613
In Australia,
"woggel" means "white."

12:50.664 --> 12:51.730
Hm.

12:51.748 --> 12:53.115
Let's get out of here.

12:53.167 --> 12:56.369
I want to lick that
turtleneck off of you.

12:56.403 --> 12:58.671
Yeah. Come on, Jenna.

12:58.705 --> 12:59.672
Fine, leave.

12:59.706 --> 13:00.673
We'll just replace you.

13:00.707 --> 13:02.241
Anyone can be replaced.

13:02.259 --> 13:03.843
Especially girlfriends.

13:03.877 --> 13:05.795
No, you don't know
what you're talking about.

13:05.846 --> 13:06.846
Paul isn't gonna--

13:06.880 --> 13:09.715
I mean, Russ.

13:09.749 --> 13:12.034
Paul is American for Russ.

13:12.069 --> 13:14.753
Oh.

13:18.041 --> 13:21.711
Ugh, Dean Cain.

13:21.745 --> 13:23.646
You know what?

13:23.697 --> 13:25.698
I'm glad Jack put you in here.

13:25.732 --> 13:29.619
Because I think we need to talk,
about talking.

13:29.653 --> 13:30.703
What's the matter with you?

13:30.737 --> 13:32.405
Are you on drugs or something?

13:32.439 --> 13:34.574
Don't you think,
at a certain point in life,

13:34.608 --> 13:38.411
parents and children should sit
down and express their feelings

13:38.445 --> 13:39.462
before it's too late?

13:39.496 --> 13:41.247
God on a wheel!

13:41.281 --> 13:43.115
Jackie and I know how we feel.

13:43.133 --> 13:47.303
We don't have to say it out loud
like a couple of gays

13:47.337 --> 13:50.957
getting married
in jean shorts in Provincetown

13:50.991 --> 13:54.727
while I'm just trying to enjoy
an ice cream on the pier!

13:54.761 --> 13:56.479
Okay, fine.
If I can't convince you,

13:56.513 --> 13:59.849
maybe you'll listen to the words
of Mike and the mechanics,

13:59.900 --> 14:05.104
whose song <i>The Living Years</i>
I definitely remember.

14:05.138 --> 14:08.140
"Say it out, speak it clear.

14:08.158 --> 14:11.410
"You should listen, dude.
Also, hear.

14:11.445 --> 14:14.347
It's too late, when--"

14:14.381 --> 14:15.998
You have two minutes

14:16.033 --> 14:20.202
to find that battery
before I die.

14:23.340 --> 14:27.143
You guys do not like talking!

14:27.177 --> 14:29.378
Great news, everyone!

14:29.429 --> 14:31.530
George foreman
is not going to Stanford.

14:31.565 --> 14:34.500
He's decided to permanently
join the entourage.

14:34.518 --> 14:36.469
I'll start the paperwork.

14:36.503 --> 14:38.471
Wait, he's not
going to college?

14:38.505 --> 14:41.057
Look, yesterday was the first
time I've ever spent the day

14:41.108 --> 14:42.841
with my dad like that, and...

14:42.859 --> 14:44.860
I just want to keep doing it.

14:44.895 --> 14:45.861
You need to take him
to security.

14:45.896 --> 14:47.029
It takes a week to get an I.D.

14:47.064 --> 14:48.698
Tony will rush it for me.

14:48.732 --> 14:51.033
We do zumba together.

14:53.186 --> 14:56.572
My son is 17.

14:56.623 --> 14:58.491
Have I really never spent
a day with him

14:58.525 --> 15:00.710
doing father and son stuff?

15:00.744 --> 15:03.195
Like teaching him
how to ride a bike...

15:03.213 --> 15:05.247
Down the Luxor pyramid.

15:05.299 --> 15:07.049
Or drive a car...

15:07.084 --> 15:10.202
Vel franchise into the ground.

15:10.220 --> 15:13.639
I never even taught
him how to shave...

15:13.674 --> 15:14.840
An orangutan.

15:14.874 --> 15:17.560
Well, sir...

15:17.594 --> 15:19.729
That doesn't mean
you're a bad father.

15:19.763 --> 15:20.980
Yes, it does.

15:21.014 --> 15:23.899
I haven't been there
for him since day one.

15:26.219 --> 15:27.186
Hey, Angie.

15:27.220 --> 15:28.187
What's up?

15:28.221 --> 15:29.888
You had the baby?

15:29.906 --> 15:32.158
Okay.
Name him George foreman.

15:32.192 --> 15:34.110
And also,
we're out of soda at home.

15:35.362 --> 15:36.895
Lamont, hurry up
and deliver that baby

15:36.913 --> 15:39.115
before they realize
we're not doctors.

15:39.166 --> 15:41.033
But I'm finally
connecting with my son,

15:41.067 --> 15:42.702
and he wants to be here.

15:42.736 --> 15:44.570
I don't know what to do.

15:44.588 --> 15:47.006
I wish I had a father
to talk to.

15:47.040 --> 15:50.259
But Liz Lemon is the only person
I know who even has a father.

15:50.293 --> 15:53.245
Well, Mr. Jordan,
speaking from experience,

15:53.263 --> 15:57.550
<i>All My Children...</i>
was cancelled.

15:57.584 --> 15:59.935
As you can see, I'm out
of my wheelhouse here.

15:59.970 --> 16:02.755
But, if you want
to talk about wheelhouses--

16:02.773 --> 16:04.640
Liz Lemon it is.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.419
You don't just jump out
of the pouch and walk away

16:33.453 --> 16:36.222
from something so good,
something that makes you happy.

16:36.256 --> 16:38.257
Wait.

16:38.291 --> 16:40.109
Are you saying I should
go back to the Woggels?

16:40.143 --> 16:41.177
The what?

16:41.228 --> 16:42.311
No.

16:42.345 --> 16:44.814
That song, like everything,
is about me.

16:44.848 --> 16:48.601
I'm the baby kangaroo
who went on the walkabout.

16:48.635 --> 16:50.736
What have I done?

16:52.289 --> 16:54.907
My driver will take you
to the airport.

16:54.941 --> 16:57.576
I'm glad you're feeling
well enough to travel.

16:57.611 --> 16:59.812
Jack, can we make sure
the pilot is a man.

16:59.830 --> 17:01.614
I don't know,
ever since Amelia Earhart,

17:01.648 --> 17:03.616
I'm a little skittish
about lady pilots.

17:03.650 --> 17:05.818
Yes, mother,
captain Chuck cutler.

17:05.836 --> 17:06.952
I'm told he has a mustache.

17:06.986 --> 17:08.654
- Mm, good.
- Good-bye, mother.

17:08.672 --> 17:10.089
I know it won't be welcome,

17:10.123 --> 17:13.242
but I will point out that this
is your final "talk-portunity."

17:13.276 --> 17:14.926
- Not another word, Lemon.
- Sew up your cabbage hole,

17:14.961 --> 17:16.011
girl.

17:16.046 --> 17:17.430
Lime to a Lemon,
you need to tell me

17:17.464 --> 17:18.964
what to do about George foreman.

17:18.998 --> 17:22.435
Liz, has this whole walkabout
thing been a mistake?

17:22.469 --> 17:23.935
- Jenna made me forget about...
- What if I'm already too late?

17:23.970 --> 17:25.170
- Why I came here, so I guess...
- What if Paul's actually...

17:25.188 --> 17:26.271
- I'll just go to the beach.
- Replaced me?

17:26.306 --> 17:29.024
Both of you need
to stop right there.

17:29.059 --> 17:30.559
If you are having
a problem with a loved one,

17:30.610 --> 17:34.012
there is only one
thing you need to do.

17:34.030 --> 17:35.030
Communicate!

17:35.065 --> 17:37.683
Go to Paul,
go to George foreman.

17:37.701 --> 17:40.786
And as difficult
as it might be,

17:40.821 --> 17:42.705
talk to them.

17:42.739 --> 17:44.573
Before you lose them forever,

17:44.624 --> 17:46.876
tell them how you feel.

17:46.910 --> 17:48.911
Have the talk.

17:48.962 --> 17:53.749
George foreman first,
dinner break, then Paul.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.000
I'm sorry,

17:55.034 --> 17:56.752
was that supposed
to be for our benefit?

17:56.803 --> 17:57.887
Do you think we're idiots?

17:57.921 --> 17:59.004
If you were my kid,

17:59.038 --> 18:01.223
I'd mail you back to the stork.

18:01.258 --> 18:02.508
She's not kidding.

18:02.542 --> 18:04.059
When I was eight, she took
me to the post office

18:04.094 --> 18:06.846
because I spilled juice on
a couch reserved for the pope,

18:06.880 --> 18:09.214
which has still never been used.

18:09.232 --> 18:10.249
He'll come.

18:10.283 --> 18:12.902
But I am sorry
I tried to mail you.

18:12.936 --> 18:13.903
I forgive you.

18:13.937 --> 18:15.104
And I'm sorry about the juice,

18:15.155 --> 18:16.939
which you should know
was actually wine.

18:16.990 --> 18:19.275
I forgive you, too.

18:19.326 --> 18:21.911
You know, you've always
been my favorite child.

18:21.945 --> 18:23.245
Thank you.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.747
You never gave me any trouble.

18:24.781 --> 18:26.415
You always ate your vegetables,

18:26.449 --> 18:27.700
you went to church,

18:27.734 --> 18:29.618
and you loved breast feeding.

18:29.669 --> 18:31.837
I just wanted
to make you proud of me.

18:31.872 --> 18:33.622
That's all I ever wanted.

18:33.673 --> 18:35.457
If I've ever had any success
in this life,

18:35.509 --> 18:36.625
it's because of you.

18:36.676 --> 18:37.693
Oh.

18:37.727 --> 18:41.947
I made this happen!

18:41.982 --> 18:45.434
Not a part of this, I get it.

18:45.468 --> 18:46.535
But I made this happen!

18:46.570 --> 18:50.539
I made this happen.

18:50.574 --> 18:52.441
Son, this isn't easy
for me to say,

18:52.475 --> 18:54.560
because my tongue
caught what my foot has.

18:54.594 --> 18:56.111
But I need to say it.

18:56.146 --> 18:57.763
You should do
what's best for you.

18:57.781 --> 19:00.866
Look, I want to go
to college, but...

19:00.901 --> 19:02.051
I love you, dad.

19:02.085 --> 19:03.869
And I'm gonna love
you no matter what.

19:03.904 --> 19:06.322
Even if you become
a doctor, or a lawyer,

19:06.373 --> 19:08.991
or a philanthropist who
devotes his life to others.

19:09.042 --> 19:11.427
I'll still be proud of you.

19:11.461 --> 19:14.747
Good-bye, my son.

19:14.781 --> 19:17.166
But dad, college doesn't
start for another five months.

19:17.217 --> 19:18.667
I said, good-bye, my son.

19:21.888 --> 19:24.223
Great.
Now let's go do my thing.

19:24.257 --> 19:26.175
Okay.

19:32.465 --> 19:33.532
Oh, God.

19:33.567 --> 19:37.519
He's dressed like her.

19:37.571 --> 19:39.989
I'm too late.

19:40.023 --> 19:43.776
I've been replaced.

19:48.331 --> 19:51.867
Kouchie?

19:59.709 --> 20:01.427
Look on the bright side.

20:01.461 --> 20:06.015
My thing went perfectly.

20:06.049 --> 20:08.717
I have something for you.

20:08.768 --> 20:10.686
It's not much,

20:10.720 --> 20:13.856
but I thought maybe you
could put it in Liddy's room.

20:13.890 --> 20:16.158
Oh.

20:16.192 --> 20:17.726
Oh.

20:17.777 --> 20:19.395
This was your mother's.

20:19.446 --> 20:23.816
Well, I know, but I wanted
to make sure you got it.

20:23.850 --> 20:25.017
Hang on.

20:25.035 --> 20:27.403
If your plan
was to have surgery,

20:27.454 --> 20:30.205
then go back to Florida
without ever seeing me,

20:30.240 --> 20:31.707
why did you bring this with you?

20:31.741 --> 20:34.994
What is this,
the Spanish inquisition?

20:35.028 --> 20:36.912
Oh, you'd know.
You lived through it.

20:36.963 --> 20:39.160
Oh.

20:43.920 --> 20:46.371
Get...off. Ow!

20:46.389 --> 20:47.906
- Get...off.
- I did this!
