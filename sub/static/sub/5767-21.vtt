WEBVTT

00:04.670 --> 00:07.036
I was devastated.

00:07.070 --> 00:10.267
All my life savings,

00:10.310 --> 00:13.199
they were gone

00:13.240 --> 00:15.538
just like that

00:15.580 --> 00:17.400
because of him.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.611
CARY:
The defendant?

00:19.650 --> 00:21.208
You blame him for
this pyramid scheme?

00:21.250 --> 00:23.411
Objection,
calls for speculation.
Mrs. Florrick,

00:23.450 --> 00:26.453
can we save our objections
for issues that really matter?

00:26.490 --> 00:28.253
I'm just trying to keep
the prosecution honest,

00:28.290 --> 00:29.120
Your Honor.

00:29.160 --> 00:30.787
Oh, sure, why not?

00:30.830 --> 00:34.459
Well, I'm in a good mood
today, so I'll sustain that.

00:38.170 --> 00:40.593
I'm, uh, sorry to do this,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:40.640 --> 00:43.108
I'll need attorneys in chambers.

00:44.340 --> 00:46.308
And, Sheriff, if you
would return the jury

00:46.340 --> 00:48.638
to the jury room, please.

00:48.680 --> 00:51.308
Looks like it
might rain, right?

00:52.820 --> 00:55.812
Um, yes, Your Honor,
by-by this afternoon.

00:55.850 --> 00:58.239
Yeah, I was in Mexico in April,
not a drop.

00:58.290 --> 01:00.451
Uh, was Mexico beautiful?

01:00.490 --> 01:02.629
I liked it,
I liked it a lot.

01:02.660 --> 01:05.151
I'm declaring a mistrial.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.829
(attorneys talk over each other)

01:07.860 --> 01:10.363
Did I say that
you could all talk?

01:11.630 --> 01:13.166
This is not about you.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.668
I have been put
in the penalty box.

01:15.700 --> 01:19.204
You'll be assigned a
new judge in a month.

01:19.240 --> 01:20.707
I've been transferred
to the 13th floor,

01:20.740 --> 01:23.504
and all my cases
will be reassigned as of, uh,

01:23.550 --> 01:25.199
11:00 am. this morning.
Great.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.639
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

01:27.680 --> 01:30.285
Yeah, a 15-year judicial career
down the drain,

01:30.320 --> 01:31.742
but hey, politics is politics.
(woman crying)

01:31.790 --> 01:32.859
Stop crying, Judy.

01:34.420 --> 01:36.581
So, you're all dismissed.

01:36.630 --> 01:40.259
You can all go and gossip
to all your lawyer friends.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.197
Ms. Lockhart, could you stay?

01:45.230 --> 01:48.358
Don't worry, it's
not ex parte.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.163
The trial is over.

01:50.210 --> 01:51.268
Get out.

01:53.910 --> 01:56.606
You can head
out, too, Judy.

01:58.810 --> 02:01.449
Ms. Lockhart,
have a seat.

02:07.390 --> 02:09.358
I need a lawyer.

02:11.760 --> 02:13.921
Civil or criminal?

02:13.960 --> 02:15.598
Possibly both.

02:15.630 --> 02:17.621
Uh, what is the case?

02:17.670 --> 02:18.819
You agree to take it?

02:18.870 --> 02:22.863
Uh, no, I need to know
the case first.

02:23.910 --> 02:26.401
(sighs)

02:26.440 --> 02:29.204
I was a prosecutor 20 years ago.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.946
I put a wife-killer in prison.

02:31.980 --> 02:34.175
And now a recent DNA test

02:34.220 --> 02:35.869
has proved that he
might not be guilty,

02:35.920 --> 02:38.445
and they're looking at how
I handled the prosecution.

02:38.490 --> 02:40.515
They're saying I kept
things from the defense.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.380
And that's why the penalty box.
Yes, I'm being

02:42.430 --> 02:44.421
investigated by the
state's attorney.

02:44.460 --> 02:48.294
I've_ been transferred to
reVIew pauper petitions

02:48.330 --> 02:50.423
until such time as I am cleared.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.299
I want you to know
that Mrs. Florrick

02:54.340 --> 02:55.489
has no sway over her husband.

02:55.540 --> 02:58.930
Ms. Lockhart, you
don't know me, do you?

03:00.710 --> 03:03.599
I'm not hiring you for
your political connections.

03:03.650 --> 03:07.370
I'm hiring you because I
respected the way that

03:07.420 --> 03:11.379
Mr. Gardner battled his recent
judICIal bribery accusations.

03:11.420 --> 03:13.718
Now, do you think I should
be getting another lawyer?

03:13.760 --> 03:15.910
DIANE:
I'm not sure it's a good idea.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.552
We said we're_ overburdened
as it is.

03:17.590 --> 03:19.820
_ No _new clients
until we hire a new litigator.

03:19.860 --> 03:22.260
It's a judge; a judge is
when you make an exception.

03:22.300 --> 03:23.324
Why?

03:23.370 --> 03:25.497
We represent Cuesta,
he'll have to recuse himself

03:25.530 --> 03:27.566
from any future cases
we have before him.

03:27.600 --> 03:28.965
Yes, but it's
the halo effect.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.831
Other judges will know
we have their back.

03:31.870 --> 03:33.679
Howard, everything
all right?

03:33.710 --> 03:36.474
Yeah, I saw you were having
a meeting of the name partners,

03:36.510 --> 03:38.341
and I thought,
since I'm a name partner,

03:38.380 --> 03:39.369
I should be here.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.478
Okay.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.442
Uh, we were just talking

03:42.490 --> 03:44.742
about whether to_take
on a new client, a judge.

03:44.790 --> 03:45.916
What kind of judge?

03:47.520 --> 03:48.817
A criminal judge.

03:48.860 --> 03:51.488
Oh, criminal, sounds smart.

03:51.530 --> 03:52.394
Mm-hmm.

03:52.430 --> 03:53.658
Okay, it's been settled.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.918
We should take on Judge Cuesta
as a client; Howard approves.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.895
Then we'll have to hire
a new litigator.

03:58.930 --> 04:00.295
Howard,

04:00.340 --> 04:01.739
isn't that a good idea?
Litigator, yeah.

04:01.770 --> 04:03.306
Got a few names,
if you want.

04:03.340 --> 04:05.865
Actually,
Alicia had a suggestion.

04:05.910 --> 04:08.276
Cary Agos.
HOWARD: Alicia?

04:08.310 --> 04:09.402
Who's Alicia?

04:09.450 --> 04:11.475
Uh, I-I am.

04:11.510 --> 04:12.442
Oh, hi.
Hi.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.516
Uh, Cary's been demoted

04:14.550 --> 04:15.676
at the state's
attorney's office.

04:15.720 --> 04:16.948
He's ready to make the jump.

04:16.990 --> 04:19.379
But are we ready
to be jumped?

04:19.420 --> 04:21.650
I've_ worked on 140 cases
Since I've been away,

04:21.690 --> 04:24.022
and I've learned a lot
about myself and the law.

04:24.060 --> 04:26.324
DIANE:
We're a bit shorthanded

04:26.360 --> 04:27.497
at the moment, Cary.

04:27.530 --> 04:28.895
We_ need someone
immediately.

04:28.930 --> 04:30.397
Will that work for you?

04:30.430 --> 04:32.739
Well, I'd need to offer
a two-week's notice,

04:32.770 --> 04:34.465
but, uh, otherwise yes.

04:34.500 --> 04:37.037
And why are you leaving the
state's attorney's office?

04:37.070 --> 04:39.504
My responsibilities
have been curtailed,

04:39.540 --> 04:40.905
and I wanted to face
greater challenges.

04:40.940 --> 04:42.441
Why curtailed?

04:43.680 --> 04:46.069
Well, unfortunately, I'm not
in a position to answer that.

04:46.110 --> 04:48.476
That's confidential
state's attorney busmess.

04:48.520 --> 04:49.646
But it shouldn't worry us?

04:49.690 --> 04:51.419
No.

04:51.450 --> 04:53.509
No, Peter will give me
a very strong recommendation.

04:53.560 --> 04:54.879
And you won't have
any difficulty

04:54.920 --> 04:56.649
going up against
your old boss?

04:56.690 --> 04:58.578
Didn't have any difficulty
going up against you two.

04:58.630 --> 05:00.655
(chuckles)

05:00.700 --> 05:03.362
Will,

05:03.400 --> 05:05.891
I'm sorry about how all that
went down the last few months.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.795
You mean the attempted
indictment of me?

05:07.840 --> 05:09.501
Yes. I want you to know

05:09.540 --> 05:11.565
I was assigned that prosecution.

05:11.610 --> 05:14.329
I never would have chosen it.

05:14.380 --> 05:17.702
HOWARD:
Who would you most
want to spend time

05:17.750 --> 05:21.572
with on a desert island?

05:25.620 --> 05:27.087
Hey.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.257
Hey, thanks.

05:28.290 --> 05:30.827
They said you put
in a good word for me.
You're getting

05:30.860 --> 05:33.090
pretty hard to beat
in court these days;
better to have you here.

05:33.130 --> 05:34.597
How'd it go?

05:34.630 --> 05:36.427
Good, I think,
but I don't want to jinx it.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.392
Don't tell Peter,
by the way.

05:38.430 --> 05:39.533
I haven't told him yet.

05:39.570 --> 05:41.595
No problem.

05:45.410 --> 05:46.968
He's everything we need
right now: a go-getter,

05:47.010 --> 05:49.501
knows the ins and outs _of
the state's attorney's office.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.144
The conflicts of interest
here could sink a battleship.

05:52.180 --> 05:54.910
Are we really suddenly worried
about conflicts of interest?

05:54.950 --> 05:57.043
We face 50 between here
and the elevator.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.614
I say we hire him.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.652
I disagree.

06:04.490 --> 06:05.582
Howard?

06:05.630 --> 06:08.497
Is he gay?

06:10.130 --> 06:12.928
He only wants to take boys
to a desert island.

06:12.970 --> 06:14.369
That's why I'm asking.

06:15.570 --> 06:17.504
Thurgood Marshall
and Keith Richards?

06:17.540 --> 06:19.838
Mm-hmm. No girls.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.474
That bothered me.

06:23.710 --> 06:25.598
I see.

06:25.650 --> 06:28.073
And, did that, uh,
bother you, too, Will?

06:29.690 --> 06:32.113
Well, I'm glad we reached
such a sensible decision.

06:32.150 --> 06:34.084
If we don't find someone better,
we go back to Cary.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.815
It sounds sensible to me.

06:38.190 --> 06:39.726
Is Judge Cuesta
coming here today?

06:39.760 --> 06:42.524
Yes, we discuss strategy
in a half hour.

06:42.570 --> 06:45.562
Which is when I have a sit-down
with Lemond Bishop.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.591
The city's top
meth dealer

06:48.640 --> 06:50.733
in the waiting room
with its top judge.

06:50.770 --> 06:54.035
Yes, that qualiﬁes
as awkward scheduling.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.548
(elevator dings)

06:56.580 --> 06:58.946
I still think you can
keep your stance.

06:58.980 --> 07:00.948
Well, then why are we arguing?

07:00.980 --> 07:02.584
PETER:
We're not arguing.

07:02.620 --> 07:04.212
I just don't like being told
what I'm doing

07:04.250 --> 07:05.808
is politically smart
when I'm doing it anyway.

07:05.850 --> 07:07.112
Okay, Peter,

07:07.160 --> 07:08.957
you're making an epically
courageous decision.

07:08.990 --> 07:10.127
How is that?

07:10.160 --> 07:12.526
When did we become an old,

07:12.560 --> 07:13.595
bickering couple?

07:13.630 --> 07:16.519
Oh, hey, did you kick out
that kid, um, Cary...

07:16.570 --> 07:18.595
Uh, what's his name?

07:18.630 --> 07:20.461
Did I what?
That kid.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.730
I saw him here at Lockhart/
Gardner looking for a job.

07:22.770 --> 07:24.101
Cary something.

07:24.140 --> 07:25.164
Cary Agos?

07:27.740 --> 07:31.141
I didn't know
you were letting him go.

07:31.180 --> 07:34.013
Terri Rooney, 24 years
old, stabbed to death

07:34.050 --> 07:35.210
in 1992.

07:35.250 --> 07:36.786
She was pregnant;
he didn't want a baby.

07:36.820 --> 07:39.015
So, he insured
her for $850,000

07:39.050 --> 07:41.257
and he killed her.
Her husband,

07:41.290 --> 07:44.123
Patrick, said he returned
home from the supermarket

07:44.160 --> 07:47.618
to find her mutilated with a
knife taken from the kitchen.

07:47.660 --> 07:49.491
But no one at the supermarket
remembered him,

07:49.530 --> 07:51.669
and he had no receipt.
Yes, it was a weak alibi.

07:51.700 --> 07:52.769
Try nonexistent.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.132
And look, he had her blood
on his shirt and his jacket.

07:55.170 --> 07:57.707
The defense claimed that it was
from his attempts to revive her.

07:57.740 --> 08:00.277
As were the defensive wounds
on his face?
Okay,

08:00.310 --> 08:02.744
we're not here to retry this,
Your Honor.

08:02.780 --> 08:04.099
Mr. Rooney's sentence
has been vacated,

08:04.150 --> 08:05.572
and he has been released,

08:05.610 --> 08:07.771
and why is that?
The killer's hand thrust down

08:07.820 --> 08:10.243
on the sharp edge of the knife
when he stabbed her,

08:10.290 --> 08:11.712
leaving his blood;
it was never tested

08:11.750 --> 08:13.650
for DNA

08:13.690 --> 08:15.612
until his appellate lawyers
petitioned it last year.

08:15.660 --> 08:17.958
_ Turns out
it was somebody else's.

08:17.990 --> 08:19.719
Look, we didn't test DNA
back then.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.728
Patrick Rooney was released
last August,

08:21.760 --> 08:23.022
when the DNA matched...
Just to be clear...

08:23.070 --> 08:25.595
...a truck driver.
,,,I did nothing less
than any prosecutor...

08:25.630 --> 08:27.666
Yes, yes, just to be clear,

08:27.700 --> 08:29.565
this isn't your
court, Your Honor.

08:29.610 --> 08:30.736
This is our offices.

08:30.770 --> 08:32.203
You need to drop
the entitlement.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.309
Excuse me?

08:33.340 --> 08:34.409
Ithought
I was explaining myself.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.977
You were acting as if you
were the injured party.

08:37.010 --> 08:38.648
I have been barred
from the bench, ma'am,

08:38.680 --> 08:39.499
and I have done nothing wrong.

08:39.550 --> 08:41.643
No, Patrick Rooney
did nothing wrong,

08:41.680 --> 08:43.648
and he spent 20 years
in prison for it.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.248
He had his wife
snatched from him,

08:45.290 --> 08:47.656
and then he was
accused of her murder.

08:47.690 --> 08:50.625
Your attitude,
Your Honor,

08:50.660 --> 08:52.992
it will do more to condemn
you than the eVIdence.

08:53.030 --> 08:54.691
You're on this side

08:54.730 --> 08:56.220
of the bench now.

08:56.260 --> 08:58.797
You have to show humility.

09:02.140 --> 09:03.698
Conﬁnue.

09:06.270 --> 09:09.239
A court of inquiry is being
commenced in two days

09:09.280 --> 09:12.340
to review the evidence
against His Honor

09:12.380 --> 09:14.575
and decide if criminal
charges should be brought.

09:14.620 --> 09:15.814
Why a court of inquiry?

09:15.850 --> 09:18.887
My guess is, due
to the personal animosity

09:18.920 --> 09:21.013
of the players.
All right, well, it
still needs a judge.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.584
Your Honor knows

09:22.630 --> 09:23.722
most of the judges
in Cook County.

09:23.760 --> 09:24.988
They'll have to
recuse themselves,

09:25.030 --> 09:26.725
so who?

09:26.760 --> 09:28.057
Would you excuse me?

09:28.100 --> 09:29.727
WILL:
Which leaves me
with two months left

09:29.770 --> 09:31.328
on my suspension.

09:31.370 --> 09:33.361
Still, I want you
to know, Mr. Bishop,

09:33.400 --> 09:36.233
your team is intact and
firing on all cylinders.

09:36.270 --> 09:38.033
And how are you doing?

09:38.070 --> 09:39.833
How am I doing?

09:39.880 --> 09:41.131
I'm good, thank you.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.772
I just worry about my clients.

09:42.810 --> 09:44.300
I'm fine.

09:44.350 --> 09:45.977
I don't think a lavwer's
working hard enough

09:46.010 --> 09:46.874
unless they get

09:46.920 --> 09:48.717
into a little legal trouble
now and then.

09:48.750 --> 09:49.944
Damon is handling
your tax issues.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.912
Roger, your trust.

09:51.950 --> 09:53.713
Mark and Eve, your criminal.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.954
And Jordan and Alicia,
your civil litigation.

09:54.990 --> 09:57.049
Mrs. Florrick, hello.

09:57.090 --> 09:58.955
Mr. Bishop.

09:58.990 --> 10:00.628
How am I doing civilly?

10:00.660 --> 10:02.252
Well, sir, no complaints.

10:02.300 --> 10:03.619
Good.

10:03.670 --> 10:04.523
Actually,

10:04.570 --> 10:06.868
_ where is that little
investigator you have?

10:06.900 --> 10:08.731
Kalinda? I think she's
in another meeting,

10:08.770 --> 10:09.998
but we can get her.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.701
Please; in fact,

10:11.740 --> 10:13.776
can I have a quick word
with Mrs. Florrick and Kalinda

10:13.810 --> 10:14.799
in private?

10:16.180 --> 10:18.239
We've represented
lawyers before, Your Honor,

10:18.280 --> 10:20.942
and they all share one trait:
backseat driving.

10:20.980 --> 10:23.414
They have trouble letting us
drive their defense.

10:23.450 --> 10:26.658
I will, uh, endeavor to behave.

10:26.690 --> 10:29.079
(whispering):
Mr. Bishop wants to talk to us.

10:31.830 --> 10:33.821
You can give us a minute, too,
Mr. Gardner.

10:34.860 --> 10:36.088
You sure?

10:36.130 --> 10:38.325
Yeah, legal stuff.

10:38.370 --> 10:40.793
You can't be helping
on it anyway--

10:40.840 --> 10:42.899
your suspension.

10:53.250 --> 10:56.788
I was approached by an FBI
agent named Lana Delaney.

10:56.820 --> 11:00.187
She seems to think I
have some tax issues

11:00.220 --> 11:02.950
due to some work
you did for me.

11:04.860 --> 11:07.249
When did she approach you?

11:11.800 --> 11:15.190
I was surprised by
this, of course.

11:15.240 --> 11:18.209
I didn't remember you
had done work for me

11:18.240 --> 11:23.177
and I was surprised to have an
FBI agent approach me at all.

11:23.210 --> 11:25.906
Yeah, I'm surprised, too.

11:25.950 --> 11:27.417
But you don't pay me
to be your client.

11:27.450 --> 11:30.283
I pay you.

11:30.320 --> 11:33.118
I pay you not to be surprised.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.378
That's my fault, sir.

11:35.420 --> 11:36.785
Due to attorney-
client privilege

11:36.830 --> 11:39.048
I was limited in
what I could share

11:39.090 --> 11:42.093
with you.

11:42.130 --> 11:43.722
You're only limited
if she tells you

11:43.770 --> 11:44.964
to be limited, right?

11:45.000 --> 11:46.968
Yes.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.888
So what's
my exposure?

11:49.940 --> 11:51.965
We're taking care of it.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.275
Listen to me.

11:59.310 --> 12:03.815
I don't_ like the
FBI coming to me,

12:03.850 --> 12:06.853
so take care
of it... fast.

12:08.890 --> 12:10.983
Are we understanding?

12:11.030 --> 12:12.383
We are.

12:21.300 --> 12:23.268
That wasn't good.

12:23.310 --> 12:24.208
No.

12:24.240 --> 12:27.937
Your FBI friend is
gonna get you killed.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.528
No word yet on a judge?

12:43.560 --> 12:45.448
No, it's still
a political hot potato.

12:45.490 --> 12:47.253
The suspicion is,
they'll choose by lottery.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.120
MAN:
Ms. Lockhart.

12:49.160 --> 12:50.161
Counselor.

12:52.130 --> 12:53.961
Judge Cuesta.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.467
Seth, they put you on this?

12:55.500 --> 12:58.037
No, I volunteered,
Your Honor.

12:58.070 --> 12:59.332
Oh, how nice,

12:59.370 --> 13:01.509
and Brutus volunteered
to govern Gaul.

13:01.540 --> 13:02.905
If nobody stepped up

13:02.950 --> 13:05.373
justice would not be served,
so I stepped up.

13:05.410 --> 13:06.240
Hmm.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.918
Always watch out
for the true believers.

13:07.950 --> 13:09.918
SHERIFF:
A|| stand.

13:09.950 --> 13:12.851
The Special Court of
Inquiry is now in session.

13:12.890 --> 13:14.187
The Honorable Murphy
Wicks presiding.

13:14.220 --> 13:15.585
Who the heck?

13:15.620 --> 13:17.850
WICKS:
Hey there.

13:17.890 --> 13:22.122
Oh, please,
you can all sit on down.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.128
Uh, I'm new
to this court,

13:24.170 --> 13:27.389
so things may go a little
slowly at first here.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.136
I'm, I'm Judge Murphy Wicks.

13:30.170 --> 13:32.365
Murph is fine with me.

13:32.410 --> 13:34.173
I'm from downstate,
Harrisburg,

13:34.210 --> 13:37.179
uh, Gateway to the
Shawnee National Forest.

13:37.210 --> 13:40.941
Population: 10,790.

13:40.980 --> 13:41.947
Yep.

13:41.980 --> 13:44.915
Oh, my gosh,
he's an idiot.

13:44.950 --> 13:46.918
ALICIA:
So our defense is simple.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.383
Prosecutorial discretion
is not misconduct.

13:49.420 --> 13:51.627
You cannot convict a prosecutor

13:51.660 --> 13:54.857
_for the choices he makes
in pursumg a prosecution.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.458
Good, and Kalinda
is on the judge?

13:56.500 --> 13:57.865
She's checking his background,

13:57.900 --> 13:59.367
but it seems
he's exactly what he says:

13:59.400 --> 14:01.334
just a small-town judge.

14:01.370 --> 14:03.304
Alicia, what do you
think of Callie Simko?

14:03.340 --> 14:06.400
Callie from our last case?

14:06.440 --> 14:07.907
Good, a bit cutthroat
but smart.

14:07.940 --> 14:09.032
Why?

14:09.080 --> 14:10.479
What do you think
of her coming here

14:10.510 --> 14:11.602
to Lockhart/Gardner?

14:11.650 --> 14:13.538
In addition to Cary?

14:13.580 --> 14:14.547
No.

14:14.580 --> 14:16.377
Well, I don't know, maybe.

14:18.620 --> 14:20.588
Sh-She's smart.

14:20.620 --> 14:23.418
I can't speak
to how she'd fit in.

14:23.460 --> 14:26.020
Okay, thanks.

14:26.060 --> 14:28.028
So, Callie,

14:28.060 --> 14:29.425
tell us about
your life.

14:29.460 --> 14:31.189
Basically I have no life.

14:31.230 --> 14:32.265
(laughs)

14:32.300 --> 14:33.665
I live for litigation.

14:33.700 --> 14:36.294
And you were suspended
for a year?

14:36.340 --> 14:39.332
Yes, I had
some overbilling issues,

14:39.370 --> 14:41.429
mostly because I had
a cocaine habit.

14:43.510 --> 14:47.469
I know, I think it's best to
state that right at the top.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.442
For the last two years
I have been in recovery.

14:49.480 --> 14:51.038
If you have any doubt

14:51.090 --> 14:52.409
you should talk
to my past employer

14:52.450 --> 14:54.315
and my clients.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.453
Thank you, I will.

14:56.490 --> 14:58.481
And why are you leaving
Hockney & Barnes?

14:58.530 --> 15:03.069
Too big, too corporate,
too many fiefdoms,

15:03.100 --> 15:05.068
and one more reason-- YOU.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.419
Me?

15:06.470 --> 15:07.232
Yes.

15:07.270 --> 15:09.693
I have respected
how you've shattered

15:09.740 --> 15:11.537
the glass ceiling
for the rest of us,

15:11.570 --> 15:15.176
and I'm sorry if it sounds
kiss-butty, but... I'm a fan.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.301
Who would you take
to a desert island?

15:19.350 --> 15:21.409
(chuckles)

15:21.450 --> 15:22.519
Who would I take?

15:22.550 --> 15:24.586
Yeah, a serious
question.

15:26.450 --> 15:31.387
Okay, I guess...
Yo-Yo Ma.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.022
Mm-hmm.
With his cello.

15:33.060 --> 15:33.924
Mm-hmm.

15:33.960 --> 15:36.497
And, uh, Brad Pitt
for a bit of eye candy.

15:36.530 --> 15:37.497
(laughter)

15:37.530 --> 15:39.088
I hope that's

15:39.130 --> 15:40.097
not too
superfICIal.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.368
Oh, no.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.402
(laughs)

15:43.440 --> 15:44.236
I like her.

15:44.270 --> 15:46.329
Good choices
for a deserted island.

15:46.370 --> 15:49.168
Yes, let me call some
of her references.

15:49.210 --> 15:50.177
Whatever.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.098
She's my choice.

15:52.150 --> 15:53.139
ELI:
Hey, Howard.

15:53.180 --> 15:54.147
How are you?
Eli.

15:54.180 --> 15:55.670
Hey, um, you know,

15:55.720 --> 15:58.188
I was thinking, we
should really talk.

15:58.220 --> 16:02.259
* I can't tell you
that I love you *

16:02.290 --> 16:06.249
* I can't say
I think of you... *

16:06.290 --> 16:08.349
What do you think?

16:08.400 --> 16:10.595
What do I...?

16:10.630 --> 16:13.394
I don't know,
I'm just here.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.260
(laughs)
What do you think?

16:15.300 --> 16:16.335
I think I'm fine.

16:16.370 --> 16:17.564
You didn't need
to do it.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.032
I have other options.

16:19.070 --> 16:22.039
I-- what are we
talking about?

16:22.080 --> 16:23.047
Work.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.401
I have another firm
after me.

16:25.450 --> 16:26.769
Huh?

16:26.810 --> 16:28.448
(laughs)

16:28.480 --> 16:30.789
You didn't arrange
the interview at your firm?

16:30.820 --> 16:33.050
You had an interview
at my firm?

16:33.090 --> 16:34.387
Yeah, yesterday.

16:34.420 --> 16:37.059
They asked
if I'd come in again.

16:37.090 --> 16:39.581
You didn't have anything
to do with that?

16:39.630 --> 16:40.597
Nothing.

16:40.630 --> 16:41.597
Well, that's weird.

16:41.630 --> 16:43.495
Lockhar_t must have
been impressed

16:43.530 --> 16:44.519
by our last case
together.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.561
I guess so.

16:48.670 --> 16:51.138
You going home?

16:51.170 --> 16:53.206
Yeah, it's getting late.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.605
So you're weirded out
by this?

16:54.640 --> 16:56.073
This weirded you out?

16:56.110 --> 16:57.247
No, I'm just
getting dressed.

16:59.610 --> 17:02.147
WOMAN:
Lynn Cuesta.

17:02.180 --> 17:05.388
I'm the daughter of... him.

17:05.420 --> 17:08.253
SETH:
You just nodded to the
defendant Richard Cuesta?

17:08.290 --> 17:09.655
WICKS:
Yes,

17:09.690 --> 17:10.657
I saw where she nodded.

17:12.360 --> 17:15.249
Thank you, Your Honor.

17:15.300 --> 17:18.394
And do you remember
the events of July 1992,

17:18.430 --> 17:20.569
when your father prosecuted
Patrick Rooney?

17:20.600 --> 17:23.706
Yes, he was pretty
passionate back then.

17:23.740 --> 17:25.537
He missed my
graduation preparing.

17:25.570 --> 17:27.470
And did you strike up
a relationship

17:27.510 --> 17:29.068
with one of the jurors
in that case?

17:29.110 --> 17:30.099
Objection, Your Honor,
no foundation.

17:30.150 --> 17:30.900
WICKS:
Okay, wait.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.542
Just let her tell
her story, okay?

17:32.580 --> 17:35.549
No more objections
for a minute here.

17:35.580 --> 17:37.411
So... what does

17:37.450 --> 17:39.589
the prosecutor
want you to say?

17:39.620 --> 17:42.589
I dated Larry Gibbs,
one of the jurors.

17:42.620 --> 17:44.281
WICKS:
Mm-hmm, and was this

17:44.330 --> 17:46.082
a very serious relationship,
Ms. Cuesta?

17:46.130 --> 17:47.256
We were together
about a year.

17:47.300 --> 17:51.521
I thought we were gonna get
married, but, you know, men.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.368
Yes, I'm sorry
for our gender.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.265
And did you

17:56.300 --> 17:58.734
and Mr. Gibbs discuss
any of this case he was on?

17:58.770 --> 17:59.737
Yeah.

17:59.770 --> 18:01.374
He liked talking
about it.

18:01.410 --> 18:03.105
His deliberations?

18:03.150 --> 18:04.299
And did you talk

18:04.350 --> 18:05.669
about your knowledge
of the case?

18:05.710 --> 18:06.472
Yes.

18:06.510 --> 18:08.671
I me-- I mean, I
knew a few things

18:08.720 --> 18:09.618
just from around
the dinner table.

18:09.650 --> 18:11.288
I told him
that stuff.

18:11.320 --> 18:12.287
WICKS:
Okay.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.287
I think I get it.

18:13.320 --> 18:14.389
Uh, is there anything else

18:14.420 --> 18:15.489
you wanted to get from her,

18:15.520 --> 18:16.509
Mr. Klinenberg?

18:16.560 --> 18:19.279
No, thank you,
Your Honor.

18:19.330 --> 18:20.729
Just a few questions,
Your Honor.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.125
No,dont,
don't do that.
Richard,

18:22.160 --> 18:23.718
we talked--
no backseat driving.

18:23.770 --> 18:24.589
Lynn,

18:24.630 --> 18:28.293
do you talk that much
to your father?

18:31.270 --> 18:33.579
No, no, Mr. Klinenberg,
you got what you wanted.

18:33.610 --> 18:34.770
Now it's
their turn.

18:34.810 --> 18:36.675
LYNN:
We were never very close.

18:36.710 --> 18:38.598
In fact didn't you try to change
your last name in 1993?

18:39.650 --> 18:41.618
So, given
the difficulties

18:41.650 --> 18:43.515
in your relationship
with your father,

18:43.550 --> 18:47.759
did you ever tell him about what
you learned from this juror?

18:47.790 --> 18:48.586
No.

18:48.620 --> 18:49.882
And did he ever ask you

18:49.920 --> 18:50.921
about what
you talked about?

18:50.960 --> 18:52.029
No.

18:52.060 --> 18:54.858
In fact did he even know
you were dating this juror?

18:54.900 --> 18:57.460
He never gave a damn
who I was dating.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.525
The day of my wedding
he didn't even send a present.

18:59.570 --> 19:01.595
No further questions.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.631
WICKS:
Thank you, Ms. Cuesta.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.272
Lynn.

19:08.980 --> 19:10.402
Too late, Dad.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.947
(door opens)

19:15.980 --> 19:18.244
(knocking on door)

19:20.790 --> 19:22.758
Are you crazy?

19:22.790 --> 19:24.758
I have a gun.

19:24.790 --> 19:26.485
Just seeing how
you're doing,

19:26.530 --> 19:29.624
Special Agent Delaney.

19:29.660 --> 19:31.799
How did you even find me?

19:31.830 --> 19:33.331
Nice place.

19:33.370 --> 19:34.337
Thanks.

19:34.370 --> 19:36.338
I'm getting
ready for bed.

19:36.370 --> 19:38.861
Yeah, I can see that.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.436
(sighs)

19:42.480 --> 19:44.869
Come on, I have
to get up early.

20:00.030 --> 20:03.193
(sighing)

20:12.770 --> 20:15.978
I chase you for two
years and nothing.

20:16.010 --> 20:20.913
What, now
you're into me?

20:46.640 --> 20:48.699
* Big fat breakfast...

20:48.740 --> 20:49.832
You're gonna
get me killed.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.872
I'm getting you what?

20:52.910 --> 20:55.572
* Big fat bluebird...

20:55.620 --> 20:57.838
You talked
to Lemond Bishop.

20:58.750 --> 21:00.786
* Big fat breakfast...

21:00.820 --> 21:02.811
So that's what
this is about?

21:04.790 --> 21:07.896
You talk to Lemond Bishop,
you get me killed.

21:07.930 --> 21:11.491
No, I talk to Lemond Bishop
and it turns up the heat.

21:12.970 --> 21:15.791
He's going
to kill me, Lana.

21:15.840 --> 21:17.808
Stop it.

21:17.840 --> 21:22.777
* Just like a breeze to me...

21:22.810 --> 21:24.607
I can't.

21:24.650 --> 21:28.472
* Just like a breeze to me...

21:28.520 --> 21:30.488
I can't.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.488
It's my job.

21:32.520 --> 21:36.616
* Just like a breeze

21:36.660 --> 21:37.752
*To me

21:37.790 --> 21:40.759
* Just like a breeze to me.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.894
(door opens, Lana sighs)

21:43.930 --> 21:46.797
(door closes)

21:49.500 --> 21:51.707
(door opens)

21:51.740 --> 21:52.764
(door closes)
CARY:
We haven't gotten

21:52.810 --> 21:54.072
a new judge yet
on the Ponzi scheme,

21:54.110 --> 21:56.305
but that gives us time
to recalibrate our attack.

21:57.140 --> 21:59.847
Okay.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.848
And that's what you were
doing-- recalibrating?

22:01.880 --> 22:03.780
Yes, sir.

22:03.820 --> 22:06.482
This case could take
a couple of months.

22:06.520 --> 22:07.714
You up to it?

22:07.760 --> 22:08.852
Yes. It's a good case.

22:08.890 --> 22:10.881
Ah. You'll see
it through?

22:12.090 --> 22:14.092
I hope to. Why?

22:15.700 --> 22:18.521
You know the one thing I prize
more than anything, Cary?

22:18.570 --> 22:19.423
It's loyalty.

22:19.470 --> 22:22.837
I had to learn it
the hard way-- scandal.

22:22.870 --> 22:23.939
Going to prison.

22:23.970 --> 22:26.837
I thought I knew the people
that I could count on.

22:26.870 --> 22:29.668
Turns out there's only
a handful that stuck by me.

22:29.710 --> 22:32.907
I got a call.

22:32.950 --> 22:34.872
Somebody saw you

22:34.920 --> 22:37.445
being interviewed
at Lockhart-Gardner.

22:37.490 --> 22:38.912
Sir, I wasn't...
_You weren't
being interVIewed?

22:38.950 --> 22:40.383
No, I was.

22:40.420 --> 22:41.853
I was intending
to tell you.

22:41.890 --> 22:43.824
But it just happened
to slip your mind?

22:43.860 --> 22:45.088
No.

22:45.130 --> 22:46.825
That was wrong.

22:46.860 --> 22:48.919
I didn't know whether
I wanted to leave.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.394
You wanted to know
if there was a soft landing

22:51.430 --> 22:52.522
before taking off?
Sir.

22:52.570 --> 22:54.788
I have lost respect here
ever since I took a step down.

22:54.840 --> 22:56.831
Yeah, I know that.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.671
Do you respect me, Cary?

23:00.710 --> 23:02.769
Of course I respect you.

23:04.710 --> 23:06.974
Not enough to
confide in me?

23:10.650 --> 23:12.618
You're right.

23:12.650 --> 23:14.652
My mistake.

23:14.690 --> 23:17.454
Well...

23:17.490 --> 23:20.129
I want you to hand off
your cases to Geneva Pine.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.628
We'll still offer
a month's severance.

23:24.900 --> 23:27.027
Thank you.

23:28.570 --> 23:30.834
I'm sorry
it happened like this.

23:31.940 --> 23:33.931
You got to do
what you got to do.

23:37.980 --> 23:38.799
Frank Peel. I reside

23:38.850 --> 23:40.442
at the Parnall
Correctional Facility

23:40.480 --> 23:43.210
in Jackson County, Michigan.

23:43.250 --> 23:44.649
And you testified

23:44.690 --> 23:46.715
in the original
Patrick Rooney murder case?

23:46.750 --> 23:48.854
Yes, I testified
for the prosecution.

23:48.890 --> 23:50.721
Hey, Dick.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.489
JUDGE WICKS:
Okay, let me
step in here.

23:52.530 --> 23:54.623
What do you want
to say, Mr. Peel?

23:54.660 --> 23:56.719
Well, it's not
what I want to say.

23:56.760 --> 23:59.627
It's that I was a cellmate
of Patrick Rooney's,

23:59.670 --> 24:01.865
and Dick over there paid me
to say that he confessed.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.037
WICKS:
He paid you?

24:03.070 --> 24:05.038
With money?
No.

24:05.070 --> 24:07.937
He gave me a conjugal visit
with my girlfriend, you know.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.106
(chuckles)

24:09.140 --> 24:10.573
And it was worth it.

24:10.610 --> 24:12.749
Thank you. Anything more,
Mr. Klinenberg?

24:12.780 --> 24:13.974
No, Your Honor.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.169
A few questions,
Your Honor.

24:15.220 --> 24:18.246
Mr. Peel, your testimony is,

24:18.290 --> 24:20.554
you were promised
a conjugal visit in trade

24:20.590 --> 24:22.012
for your testimony
against Rooney?

24:22.060 --> 24:24.028
That's right. What I said.

24:24.060 --> 24:28.258
And what was promised to you
to testify against Judge Cuesta?

24:28.300 --> 24:30.598
What do you mean?

24:30.630 --> 24:31.961
You're still in prison,
aren't you?

24:32.000 --> 24:33.638
Uh-huh.

24:33.670 --> 24:35.865
Did the prosecution do
what prosecutors often

24:35.900 --> 24:37.868
do when they want
damaging testimony?
Objection.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.866
No, Mr. Klinenberg.
Go ahead, ma'am.

24:39.910 --> 24:44.506
Did they offer you leniency
in trade for your testimony?

24:46.880 --> 24:49.144
Well, they offered to speak
at my parole hearing,

24:49.180 --> 24:51.740
if that's what you
mean, but I wouldn't

24:51.790 --> 24:52.643
call that paying, you know?

24:52.690 --> 24:54.612
It's just what friends do
for friends.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.958
Okay, thank you, Mr. Peel.

24:56.990 --> 24:59.527
We don't need anything more
from you.

25:00.730 --> 25:02.891
That was nicely done.

25:02.930 --> 25:05.069
Thank you, Your Honor.

25:05.100 --> 25:07.534
You what?

25:07.570 --> 25:09.538
I'm dating her.

25:09.570 --> 25:12.937
You're dating
Callie Simko?

25:12.970 --> 25:16.303
Yes. Just recently.

25:16.340 --> 25:19.901
Will, H...
I don't mean to intrude,

25:19.950 --> 25:23.545
but could you please
keep your pants zipped?

25:23.590 --> 25:25.911
I didn't know you were bringing
her in for an interview.

25:25.950 --> 25:27.918
If you had invited me
in for the interview...

25:27.960 --> 25:29.916
Oh, yes, I'm the problem.
The only reason

25:29.960 --> 25:31.279
we're interviewing anyone
at all is because

25:31.330 --> 25:32.854
you vetoed Cary.

25:32.890 --> 25:34.949
She's good, isn't she?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.251
Callie.

25:36.300 --> 25:38.291
Yes. Howard liked her.

25:39.700 --> 25:41.895
She wanted men
on her deserted island.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.969
Okay, let me figure
something out.

25:46.010 --> 25:47.807
ELI:
See?

25:47.840 --> 25:50.968
They really don't
include you in the group.

25:51.010 --> 25:52.978
Hmm.
They're using you.

25:53.010 --> 25:54.819
So, um...

25:54.850 --> 25:56.943
what do I do?

25:56.980 --> 25:58.845
Well, Julius Cain
and I would like you

25:58.890 --> 26:01.814
to join us in
voting Will out.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.851
WOMAN:
I'm embarrassed to say,

26:03.890 --> 26:05.084
I used to be a heavy smoker.

26:05.130 --> 26:07.724
I'm embarrassed to say...
I still am.

26:07.760 --> 26:08.897
You're kidding,
Your Honor.

26:08.930 --> 26:09.851
You're killing yourself.

26:09.900 --> 26:11.219
Yeah, I know.
My wife says

26:11.270 --> 26:12.965
she's kicking me
out unless I quit.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.729
WOMAN:
Have you tried the patch?

26:14.770 --> 26:15.737
JUDGE WICKS:
No, but I will.

26:15.770 --> 26:17.829
Anyway, you were
the jury foreman?
WOMAN: Yes.

26:17.870 --> 26:19.838
And I was one of the last
holdouts for not guilty.

26:19.870 --> 26:21.929
But you changed your
vote to guilty?

26:21.980 --> 26:22.776
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

26:22.810 --> 26:24.778
Do you mind if
I take over?
Please.

26:24.810 --> 26:27.108
Yes. Once I voted guilty,
we were unanimous.

26:27.150 --> 26:29.072
And why did you
change your vote?

26:29.120 --> 26:30.712
There was this smoking area--

26:30.750 --> 26:32.945
a little courtyard
outside the jury room--

26:32.990 --> 26:36.357
and I_saw some evidence there
during our last lunch break.

26:36.390 --> 26:38.221
First, I thought it was
left there accidentally.

26:38.260 --> 26:40.228
KLINENBERG:
And what was
that evidence?

26:40.260 --> 26:41.192
WOMAN:
Photos of the husband,

26:41.230 --> 26:44.620
Mr. Rooney, the accused,
covered with blood.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.968
KLINENBERG:
And this was evidence
that was excluded

26:47.000 --> 26:49.889
from the trial because _it
was conSIdered prejudICIal?

26:49.940 --> 26:51.931
Yes, I guess we weren't
supposed to see it.

26:51.970 --> 26:53.335
And why do you say
that this evidence

26:53.370 --> 26:54.439
wasn't left there accidentally?

26:54.480 --> 26:56.801
Because I saw that man--
the prosecutor over there--

26:56.840 --> 26:58.899
leaving the evidence
there in the courtyard.

26:58.950 --> 27:01.214
CUESTA:
Well, I didn't

27:01.250 --> 27:03.013
do that.
I would never do that.

27:03.050 --> 27:04.278
We could play off
faulty vision.

27:04.320 --> 27:05.742
The foreman used
to wear glasses.

27:05.790 --> 27:06.984
It'll be hard to undercut her.

27:07.020 --> 27:08.749
Judge Wicks believed her.

27:10.190 --> 27:12.750
You had a co-counsel
on the case, Your Honor?

27:12.790 --> 27:14.223
CUESTA:
Yes, an ASA

27:14.260 --> 27:15.727
I supervised. Why?

27:15.760 --> 27:17.660
I saw a photo
of him

27:17.700 --> 27:18.860
in the file
somewhere.

27:18.900 --> 27:20.959
CUESTA:
Yes, that's Lloyd Bullock.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.298
But he had nothing to do with
the crime scene evidence.

27:23.340 --> 27:25.035
He was a good man.
And you were balding,

27:25.070 --> 27:27.800
then, too, in 1992?

27:27.840 --> 27:30.138
He had nothing to do
with the crime scene evidence.

27:30.180 --> 27:31.374
Yes, but during deliberations,

27:31.410 --> 27:34.243
you weren't in complete control
of that evidence.

27:34.280 --> 27:36.009
No, I was.

27:36.050 --> 27:38.939
Your Honor, they're saying
that you leaked

27:38.990 --> 27:40.139
excluded evidence to the jury

27:40.190 --> 27:42.158
_ to win_a verdict
against an innocent man.

27:42.190 --> 27:43.919
Which you did not do, right?

27:43.960 --> 27:44.927
That's correct.

27:44.960 --> 27:47.690
Then we need to point our finger
at someone else.

27:47.730 --> 27:49.220
Yes, but not at someone
who's innocent.

27:49.260 --> 27:51.262
Well, how do you
know he's innocent?

27:51.300 --> 27:53.359
I mean, this was a
photo that was leaked.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.868
You had access to it.

27:55.900 --> 27:57.765
Your co-couns_el
had access to it.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.766
He was with me
during deliberations.

27:59.810 --> 28:01.971
That's how I know
that he didn't do it.

28:02.010 --> 28:02.999
During the whole deliberations?

28:03.040 --> 28:04.007
CUESTA
Yes.
And you know that

28:04.050 --> 28:05.870
for a fact?
I do.

28:05.910 --> 28:08.708
He didn't leave you once,
even to go to the restroom?

28:08.750 --> 28:10.047
Oh, come on, what is
this, the third grade?

28:10.080 --> 28:11.479
I'm not naive.
I know what you're doing here.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.044
You're defense attorneys.

28:13.090 --> 28:14.978
You poke holes in the
prosecution's case,

28:15.020 --> 28:17.488
which is everything I've been
disgusted by my entire life.

28:17.520 --> 28:18.851
Playing games with the truth.

28:18.890 --> 28:19.959
DIANE:
And when you're back
on the bench,

28:19.990 --> 28:21.127
you can be disgusted again,

28:21.160 --> 28:22.491
but for the moment, we need

28:22.530 --> 28:24.361
to defend you, or you won't
get back on the bench.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.968
WILL:_
Hey, Callie.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.434
I'm not going to be able
to make it tonight.

28:30.470 --> 28:33.132
Yeah, sorry.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.434
Family stuff. Yeah.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.436
Yeah, I'll talk to you.

28:44.150 --> 28:46.118
What do you think?

28:46.150 --> 28:48.118
Don't touch it.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.116
It'll take care of itself.

28:50.160 --> 28:51.286
My name is Lloyd Bullock.

28:51.330 --> 28:54.993
I was an ASA and His Honor
Cuesta's co-counsel in 1992.

28:55.030 --> 28:56.349
Hey, Richard.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.992
Lloyd.

28:58.030 --> 29:01.067
And you looked nothing
like you do now back then?

29:01.100 --> 29:03.398
(chuckling):
Well, we've all gotten older.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.135
Not all of us.

29:05.170 --> 29:09.072
I'm sorry to be delving
into this, sir, but your hair...

29:09.110 --> 29:10.179
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

29:10.210 --> 29:11.768
No, I see where Mrs. Florrick
is going with this.

29:14.150 --> 29:17.119
Balding.
Yes, this is a hairweave.

29:17.150 --> 29:17.912
Ah, very good one.

29:17.950 --> 29:19.884
Thank you. I'm in
real estate now.

29:19.920 --> 29:22.457
It's_almost _
an occupational neceSSIty.

29:22.490 --> 29:26.051
So, you used to look a bit
like Judge Cuesta in 1992?

29:26.090 --> 29:28.399
I guess.
With glasses, my hairline...

29:28.430 --> 29:31.365
And you were a smoker back then
in 1992, weren't you?

29:31.400 --> 29:33.834
Yes. Not a heaw
one, but yes.

29:33.870 --> 29:35.132
And so, you had access

29:35.170 --> 29:37.138
to the courtyard smoking area
outside the jury room?

29:37.170 --> 29:39.809
Well, yeah,
it was the one smoking area.

29:39.840 --> 29:40.761
And you were left in charge

29:40.810 --> 29:42.107
of all the evidence
during deliberations?

29:42.140 --> 29:44.802
No.

29:44.850 --> 29:48.149
You weren't in charge
of the prosecutorial evidence?

29:48.180 --> 29:49.477
No.

29:53.150 --> 29:55.914
My mistake.
But you did have access to it?

29:55.960 --> 29:57.109
And you were to keep charge

29:57.160 --> 29:58.559
_ of admissible and
inadmi55ible eVIdence?

29:58.590 --> 29:59.522
WICKS:
I think they're trying

29:59.560 --> 30:02.120
to suggest you left
some inadmissible evidence

30:02.160 --> 30:03.127
in this smoking area

30:03.160 --> 30:05.025
to be seen by a juror.
Is that what happened?

30:05.070 --> 30:06.196
LLOYD:
No, Your Honor.

30:06.230 --> 30:06.992
No further questions.

30:07.030 --> 30:09.032
WICKS:
Yeah, well, I have a few.

30:09.070 --> 30:10.264
Mr. Bullock, did you go out

30:10.300 --> 30:12.439
into that courtyard
during deliberations?

30:12.470 --> 30:14.529
No, Your Honor.
Where were you
during deliberations?

30:14.580 --> 30:16.138
With Mr. Cuesta.

30:16.180 --> 30:17.135
We were together
the whole time.

30:17.180 --> 30:18.875
WICKS:
That true, Judge?

30:18.910 --> 30:21.879
Objection. Judge Cuesta isn't
on the stand, Your Honor.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.844
Yes, and if this were a trial
and not a Court of Inquiry,

30:24.890 --> 30:26.016
I wouldn't be doing this,

30:26.050 --> 30:27.210
but I am doing this.

30:27.250 --> 30:29.411
Your Honor, as one
judge to another,

30:29.460 --> 30:31.485
was Mr. Bullock with you
during deliberations,

30:31.530 --> 30:33.088
and therefore, unable

30:33.130 --> 30:35.291
to leave this excluded evidence
for a juror?

30:40.270 --> 30:43.159
Yes, Your Honor, he was with me.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.509
WICKS:
For the whole deliberations?

30:45.540 --> 30:48.031
Yes, for the whole
deliberations.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.207
(sighs)

30:50.240 --> 30:52.549
Thank you.

30:52.580 --> 30:54.912
Think we can excuse
this Witness.

30:54.950 --> 30:56.577
Just a few questions.

30:56.620 --> 30:58.087
Quit while you're
ahead, Mr. Klinenberg.

31:04.660 --> 31:07.993
These are the checks in question
from Mr. Bishop's corporation.

31:08.030 --> 31:10.897
But this is a copy of an e-mail
from Will Gardner.

31:10.930 --> 31:12.466
You will note

31:12.500 --> 31:14.468
that it is dated three weeks
prior to the first check.

31:14.500 --> 31:18.061
"Kalinda, the client
asked me to have you look

31:18.110 --> 31:20.101
_ "into matters we _
discussed at the meeting.

31:20.140 --> 31:21.471
"Please keep me posted.

31:21.510 --> 31:22.602
Thanks. Will."

31:22.640 --> 31:24.278
Seriously?

31:24.310 --> 31:25.641
It was work

31:25.680 --> 31:26.647
that was done for
Lockhart-Gardner, and as such,

31:26.680 --> 31:29.569
it is covered _ _
by attorney-client prIVIlege.

31:29.620 --> 31:31.941
If this is work done
for Lockhart-Gardner,

31:31.990 --> 31:34.288
then why did Lemond Bishop
pay Kalinda directly?

31:34.320 --> 31:35.958
That was an accounting error.

31:35.990 --> 31:37.184
Mr. Bishop...
Come on.

31:37.220 --> 31:38.619
Mr. Bishop's
business manager

31:38.660 --> 31:41.220
incorrectly cut the checks
to Ms. Sharma directly.

31:41.260 --> 31:43.251
Having done so,
the firm didn't want

31:43.300 --> 31:45.063
to double-bill their client,

31:45.100 --> 31:46.067
so they let it stand.

31:46.100 --> 31:48.568
You do realize
I don't believe a word of this,

31:48.600 --> 31:50.465
don't you?

31:50.500 --> 31:53.003
Whatever.

31:53.040 --> 31:56.430
You tell Kalinda
this isn't over.

32:00.110 --> 32:02.670
I think what we should do
is push Diane out, also.

32:02.720 --> 32:05.609
Hmm? I mean, the
question is, "Value added."

32:05.650 --> 32:08.153
Who adds, who doesn't, right?

32:08.190 --> 32:09.111
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.286
Hey, you.

32:10.320 --> 32:11.628
Coffee lid on
the coffee cup.

32:11.660 --> 32:12.979
What are you thinking?

32:13.030 --> 32:14.019
Excuse me, Howard.
I got to make a call.

32:14.060 --> 32:16.324
I think we should make our move
before the summer.

32:16.360 --> 32:17.497
Summer's when things slow down.

32:17.530 --> 32:19.020
You know?

32:19.070 --> 32:21.095
I don't know, Howard.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.664
I really don't know.

32:22.700 --> 32:24.668
Please just forget
I said anything.

32:24.710 --> 32:28.100
Can we just go back
to us not talking? Please?

32:33.610 --> 32:36.170
Excuse me. You, uh, Mara Stokes?

32:38.220 --> 32:40.484
You prosecution or defense?

32:40.520 --> 32:42.283
I'm sorry?

32:42.320 --> 32:44.322
When I heard that Cuesta's head
was on the chopping block,

32:44.360 --> 32:48.194
I figured one of you would come
looking his investigator up.

32:48.230 --> 32:51.768
Plus, this place doesn't get
too many customers like you.

32:51.800 --> 32:54.234
Then maybe you could help me.

32:54.270 --> 32:57.535
Did Cuesta bend the rules to get
a conviction on Patrick Rooney?

32:57.570 --> 32:59.606
Straight shooter.

32:59.640 --> 33:01.779
I like your M.O.

33:01.810 --> 33:03.175
Kalinda.

33:03.210 --> 33:05.041
Well, Kalinda,

33:05.080 --> 33:08.447
Richard Cuesta
fancied himself a
true public servant,

33:08.480 --> 33:10.277
and he was gonna nail
Patrick Rooney,

33:10.320 --> 33:12.208
come hell or high water.

33:12.250 --> 33:14.286
And did hell or
high water ever come?

33:14.320 --> 33:15.787
May have.

33:15.820 --> 33:17.117
If you're like me,

33:17.160 --> 33:20.459
you have access to
the state's attorney
evidence locker, right?

33:20.490 --> 33:22.026
Yeah.

33:22.060 --> 33:25.188
Well, there's something
that never... quite...

33:25.230 --> 33:27.221
sat right with me.

33:27.270 --> 33:29.329
What is it?
Well, you'll find out.

33:33.070 --> 33:34.139
Thanks.

33:34.180 --> 33:37.775
Um... can I offer you a
little life advice, Kalinda?

33:39.280 --> 33:40.679
Sure.

33:40.710 --> 33:42.678
Get out while you can.

33:45.690 --> 33:48.250
Just don't go into retail.

33:48.290 --> 33:50.281
(laughs quietly)

33:53.660 --> 33:56.458
KALIN DA:
Four purchases, all on

33:56.500 --> 33:59.060
Terri Rooney's credit card
the day after her death.

33:59.100 --> 34:00.522
And more importantly,

34:00.570 --> 34:02.788
the day after Patrick
Rooney was in custody.

34:02.840 --> 34:05.104
Meaning Rooney probably
wasn't the killer.

34:05.140 --> 34:07.358
You never saw these?
Do you have any idea

34:07.410 --> 34:09.275
how much evidence
I had to sift through?

34:09.310 --> 34:12.177
Plus, I was carrying
a dozen other cases...
Your Honor,

34:12.210 --> 34:14.144
that is not an answer.
It was

34:14.180 --> 34:15.249
20 years ago, okay?

34:15.280 --> 34:16.349
I don't remember.

34:16.380 --> 34:18.348
I do not... recall

34:18.390 --> 34:19.482
seeing this
evidence.

34:19.520 --> 34:21.784
You used to carry
a big case load.

34:21.820 --> 34:24.254
Would you review every piece
of evidence on every case?

34:24.290 --> 34:27.259
That depended on
how busy I was.
So what would you do

34:27.290 --> 34:29.190
with the evidence
you couldn't reVIew?

34:29.230 --> 34:31.266
I'd farm it out.
To your co-counsel?

34:32.830 --> 34:34.138
No.

34:34.170 --> 34:35.489
I have to draw

34:35.540 --> 34:39.260
a line somewhere.
Really? And this is where
you choose to draw it?

34:39.310 --> 34:41.301
Yes.
You had prosecutorial
blinders on.

34:41.340 --> 34:44.275
You saw these photos
of a mutilated wife,

34:44.310 --> 34:45.800
and you wanted
to put someone away.

34:45.850 --> 34:48.216
That made you focus
on the evidence that helped,

34:48.250 --> 34:50.343
and ignore
the evidence that hurt.

34:51.390 --> 34:53.119
Well, then...
I'm guilty.

34:53.150 --> 34:55.380
ALICIA:
Your Honor, if you
farmed out the review

34:55.420 --> 34:56.648
of this evidence
to Lloyd Bullock

34:56.690 --> 34:58.453
and he didn't
inform you of it,

34:58.490 --> 35:01.254
then this really is
his fault, not yours.

35:07.500 --> 35:10.833
Do you think there's a hell?

35:10.940 --> 35:12.532
No.

35:12.570 --> 35:14.174
I don't, either.

35:15.210 --> 35:18.373
But then I meet lawyers...

35:18.410 --> 35:20.401
and I change my mind.

35:20.450 --> 35:22.372
(doorbell rings)

35:24.390 --> 35:25.709
Callie.

35:25.750 --> 35:27.741
I thought we
were gonna...

35:29.390 --> 35:32.359
I didn't take the job.

35:32.390 --> 35:34.255
I just called Diane

35:34.300 --> 35:36.291
and told her.

35:37.660 --> 35:40.390
You didn't take the job?
Nope.

35:41.670 --> 35:42.898
Look,

35:42.940 --> 35:45.465
I feel like I need
to be very clear here.

35:45.510 --> 35:46.568
I never asked you...

35:46.610 --> 35:48.737
Oh, Will, just be quiet.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.930
You think it's about you?

35:50.980 --> 35:52.948
Men always think
it's about them.

35:52.980 --> 35:55.414
I got a better offer--
Bonnie, Abrams & O'Connell.

35:55.450 --> 35:57.816
They're gonna make me
junior partner.

35:57.850 --> 36:00.410
Plus, it's closer
to my apartment.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.454
I have baggage.

36:10.500 --> 36:11.489
(laughs)

36:11.530 --> 36:14.397
Well, let's see it.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.691
Come on.

36:16.740 --> 36:18.901
You'll see it soon enough.

36:18.940 --> 36:20.202
Oh, yeah?

36:20.240 --> 36:22.800
Promises, promises.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.385
This is... this is very
generous.

36:33.420 --> 36:35.752
We think the salary is
befitting our first choice.

36:35.790 --> 36:37.712
This is where you
grew up, Cary.

36:37.760 --> 36:40.820
We'd love to have
you come home.

36:40.860 --> 36:42.657
I'd be honored.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.019
Oh, we're gonna
need you

36:44.060 --> 36:46.824
to hit the ground
sprinting-- we're stretched
pretty thin right now.

36:46.870 --> 36:49.691
Load me up.
(laughs)

36:49.740 --> 36:51.731
Oh, I'm needed in court.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.839
Welcome back, Cary.

36:56.880 --> 36:58.973
Thank you.

37:02.820 --> 37:03.946
So...

37:03.980 --> 37:06.483
Yeah. Look, the only way
this is gonna work

37:06.520 --> 37:08.511
is if we start
with a clean slate.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.858
So I hereby declare
any unresolved issues

37:10.890 --> 37:13.324
between us...

37:13.360 --> 37:14.998
officially resolved.

37:16.660 --> 37:17.820
Thank you.

37:17.860 --> 37:19.862
I'll get you
an office lined up.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.834
And given your experience
as Deputy S.A.,

37:21.870 --> 37:25.328
we'd like you to take on some
managerial responsibilities.

37:25.370 --> 37:26.928
Personnel related,
if you're game.

37:26.970 --> 37:28.835
Yeah, sure.
What is it?

37:28.880 --> 37:30.905
We need a slush fund.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.906
Slush fund.
Yeah.

37:33.950 --> 37:37.670
For, uh, discretionary
expenses. You know.

37:39.790 --> 37:42.554
Getting clients laid.

37:42.590 --> 37:45.479
This isn't my first
lousy economy.

37:45.530 --> 37:47.327
That's a surefire way

37:47.360 --> 37:49.692
to keep business
from walking out that door.

37:50.730 --> 37:52.721
Uh, hey. Hey.

37:53.770 --> 37:55.362
Excuse me.

37:55.400 --> 37:56.367
(speaks indistinctly)

37:56.400 --> 37:59.563
Hey. So, you're back.

37:59.610 --> 38:00.804
Iam.

38:00.840 --> 38:03.479
Is it gonna be
okay for you?
Why wouldn't it?

38:05.010 --> 38:08.309
Um, I'm going for a drink later
with some of the third-years.

38:08.350 --> 38:09.749
You want to meet us?

38:09.780 --> 38:10.849
Um...

38:10.880 --> 38:12.381
I don't know. I...

38:12.420 --> 38:14.854
I have a lot on...
At Brando's.

38:14.890 --> 38:17.882
But thanks. Um,
maybe next time.

38:21.830 --> 38:25.459
Nope. Never seen those credit
card receipts before in my life.

38:25.500 --> 38:28.094
ALICIA:
There are four receipts
from Ms. Rooney's credit card,

38:28.130 --> 38:29.995
all after Patrick Rooney
was in custody.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.337
I can understand

38:31.370 --> 38:33.930
missing one, but four?

38:33.970 --> 38:35.437
Objection.
Asked and answered.
Withdrawn.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.708
Was one of the tasks

38:36.740 --> 38:38.708
delegated to you by my client

38:38.750 --> 38:41.378
the compiling
of all financial information

38:41.420 --> 38:42.671
in this case?
Yes.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.073
So all the credit
card receipts

38:44.120 --> 38:45.985
would have to cross your desk

38:46.020 --> 38:47.715
first, and then

38:47.750 --> 38:49.456
it would be your
responsibility to alert

38:49.490 --> 38:51.651
ASA questions.
If they had been discovered.

38:51.690 --> 38:52.850
And if they had, yes,

38:52.890 --> 38:54.699
I would have
turned them over to Richard.

38:54.730 --> 38:57.949
You were injured
in a car accident
earlier in the year?

38:58.000 --> 39:00.025
New Year's?
Yes. So?

39:00.070 --> 39:01.628
In May of that year,

39:01.670 --> 39:03.695
two_ months before
Terri Rooney's case,

39:03.740 --> 39:06.903
did you register yourself
at the CLR Clinic

39:06.940 --> 39:08.999
for an addiction
to hydrocodone

39:09.040 --> 39:10.735
that you developed
after that accident?

39:10.780 --> 39:12.873
Objection. Your Honor,
this credit card information,

39:12.910 --> 39:15.879
it really incriminates
the accused, not Mr. Bullock.
Except the accused was not

39:15.920 --> 39:16.944
the one addicted
to painkillers.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.413
Which has nothing
to do with these

39:18.450 --> 39:19.644
credit card receipts.
Credit card receipts

39:19.690 --> 39:20.918
you didn't even know
existed until we

39:20.950 --> 39:21.882
brought them
to this court's attention.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.649
Yes, which you're only
doing to reassign blame.

39:23.690 --> 39:25.681
Excuse me?
Why would we do that?

39:25.730 --> 39:27.049
Why would we
bring forward evidence

39:27.090 --> 39:28.955
that would be damaging to us?

39:29.000 --> 39:30.729
Because you were afraid
I would bring it forward.

39:30.760 --> 39:32.125
Oh, Your Honor, I'm not sure

39:32.170 --> 39:33.865
whether to be flattered
or outraged

39:33.900 --> 39:35.629
by the prosecutor's regard
for our malevolence

39:35.670 --> 39:36.898
and our...
Okay, okay. Okay.

39:36.940 --> 39:38.532
Both said your piece? Good.

39:38.570 --> 39:40.504
Let's just sit on down,
stop posturing.

39:41.540 --> 39:43.633
Let's just
talk, okay?

39:43.680 --> 39:46.399
Mr. Bullock...

39:46.450 --> 39:49.442
were you addicted to painkillers

39:49.480 --> 39:51.448
in 1992?

39:51.490 --> 39:54.084
Yes, Your Honor, I had
a dependency problem,
but I never...

39:54.120 --> 39:56.088
I understand that, sir.

39:56.120 --> 39:59.157
Did you mention this dependency
to your co-counsel over there?

40:00.730 --> 40:01.992
No.

40:02.030 --> 40:03.588
Okay.

40:03.630 --> 40:05.029
Judge Cuesta...

40:05.070 --> 40:07.823
did you ever see any
of these credit card receipts?

40:10.640 --> 40:11.766
No.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.209
Mm.

40:13.240 --> 40:15.708
And who had the responsibility

40:15.740 --> 40:17.708
for this evidence?
Your Honor...

40:17.740 --> 40:20.504
_ JUDGE: _
Wait your turn, Sir.
I'm asking His Honor.

40:20.550 --> 40:22.017
Judge?

40:24.850 --> 40:27.148
My co-counsel had
the responsibility.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.785
That is not true.

40:31.830 --> 40:34.025
Thank you, Mr. Bullock.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.168
Okay.

40:39.200 --> 40:41.794
You may step down, sir.

40:48.110 --> 40:50.635
I have no more questions.

40:54.820 --> 40:58.711
(guitar playing
upbeat pop intro)

40:58.750 --> 41:01.116
* One, two,
one, two, three, four! *

41:01.150 --> 41:02.651
To Cary Agos.

41:02.690 --> 41:04.487
Welcome back
to the dark side.

41:04.530 --> 41:05.986
OTHERS:
To the dark side!

41:06.030 --> 41:07.554
And to Alicia Florrick,

41:07.590 --> 41:09.194
who got a judge
off today.

41:09.230 --> 41:11.562
Ooh!
(laughing)
Uh...

41:11.600 --> 41:13.488
correction--

41:13.530 --> 41:16.135
got a judge out of
the penalty box today.

41:16.170 --> 41:17.990
WOMAN:
Congratulations!

41:19.110 --> 41:21.578
You're running with
the pack these days.

41:21.610 --> 41:22.838
What?

41:22.880 --> 41:24.677
Doing well.

41:24.710 --> 41:26.849
You're light.

41:26.880 --> 41:29.075
Oh, I don't know, Cary.

41:29.120 --> 41:31.179
Sometimes I get it,
I get the law,

41:31.220 --> 41:33.085
I get what I'm doing here,

41:33.120 --> 41:36.988
and then there are moments
where I think, "What the...

41:37.020 --> 41:39.887
what am I doing?"

41:39.930 --> 41:42.023
Um... you're helping people.

41:42.060 --> 41:45.120
A judge, like today?
Wasn't he innocent?

41:46.170 --> 41:48.320
Does it matter?

41:52.210 --> 41:54.804
Alicia...

41:54.840 --> 41:56.831
I went away for two years,

41:56.880 --> 41:58.745
now I'm back,

41:58.780 --> 42:01.817
and I haven't
learned a thing.

42:01.850 --> 42:04.068
(laughs)
Two years of my life gone,

42:04.120 --> 42:07.783
and I'm just as stupid as I...
I was when I left law school.

42:07.820 --> 42:10.084
Oh, it's okay.

42:10.120 --> 42:12.953
What is there to learn?

42:12.990 --> 42:14.958
That people lie.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.151
And the people who judge,
they lie the most.

42:18.200 --> 42:20.225
(phone ringing)

42:23.300 --> 42:26.007
What?

42:26.040 --> 42:28.235
(beep)
I'm here cheating
with you.

42:29.280 --> 42:31.271
Would you excuse me?

42:33.810 --> 42:35.812
*

42:43.090 --> 42:45.752
* Got my money's worth...
