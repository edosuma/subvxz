00:01.102 --> 00:02.002
**

00:02.103 --> 00:02.936
Jackpot.

00:03.037 --> 00:05.873
**

00:05.973 --> 00:07.708
One points.

00:07.808 --> 00:11.679
**

00:11.779 --> 00:14.048
Iz raining!

00:14.148 --> 00:15.549
**

00:15.649 --> 00:16.517
Dinner.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.086
It's what's for dinner.

00:18.186 --> 00:20.721
Now, I've been up since 10:00,
so I'm turning in.

00:20.821 --> 00:23.091
Enjoy, my babies.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.393
ANNOUNCER: Channel 36
is incredibly proud

00:25.493 --> 00:27.928
to present our midnight movie,

00:28.028 --> 00:31.065
The Hobbit:
The Desolation of Smowg.

00:31.165 --> 00:35.369
(gasps) Stan, it's Smowg.
He's about to be desolated.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.138
Stan?

00:38.439 --> 00:39.440
Huh.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.575
Huh.

00:42.776 --> 00:43.777
Huh.

00:44.412 --> 00:45.413
Huh.

00:46.314 --> 00:48.316
No.

00:52.386 --> 00:53.754
Uh-oh.

00:53.854 --> 00:55.589
What the hell are you guys
doing down here?

00:55.689 --> 00:58.726
Uh, you know how you never
learned what lacrosse is?

00:58.826 --> 00:59.960
Yeah?

01:00.060 --> 01:00.961
Well, this is it.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.963
This is lacrosse.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.766
**

01:05.866 --> 01:08.169
* Good morning, U.S.A. *

01:08.269 --> 01:12.005
* I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day *

01:12.106 --> 01:15.143
* The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face *

01:15.243 --> 01:19.513
* And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race *

01:21.449 --> 01:24.852
* Oh, boy, it's swell to say *

01:24.952 --> 01:27.255
-* Good -- *
-* Good morning, U.S.A. *

01:27.355 --> 01:28.322
Aah!

01:29.823 --> 01:32.960
* Good morning, U.S.A. *

01:33.060 --> 01:35.596
So, every night
after I'm asleep,

01:35.696 --> 01:37.598
you come down
to the crawl space?

01:37.698 --> 01:39.433
I don't understand.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.935
A crawl space is an area
between floors,

01:42.035 --> 01:43.871
where crawling is
not just allowed,

01:43.971 --> 01:45.206
it's encouraged --

01:45.306 --> 01:46.974
I know what a crawl space is,
Stan.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.476
Did you, though?

01:48.576 --> 01:50.978
I mean,
why are you eating down here?

01:51.078 --> 01:53.881
Are you hiding
from me?

01:53.981 --> 01:55.616
Just give it to me
straight.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.385
We're still hungry
'cause your dinner stinks!

01:57.485 --> 01:58.352
-It sucks!
-Whoa!

01:58.452 --> 01:59.520
-Easy!
-Hey!

01:59.620 --> 02:02.356
-(chuckles)
-Uh, we hate you.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.225
-You're a bad lady!
-Jeff!

02:04.325 --> 02:05.626
Alright, that's it.

02:05.726 --> 02:06.894
Go to the dark part
of the crawl space

02:06.994 --> 02:09.363
-for 10 minutes.
-It's ridiculous.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.465
The dinner was bad?

02:11.565 --> 02:13.701
I followed the recipe
to a "T."

02:13.801 --> 02:17.838
It was Certified "Yim Yam Yummo"
by Rachael Ray herself!

02:17.938 --> 02:20.241
It's not that
your cooking's bad...

02:20.341 --> 02:23.511
Gee, how do we put
it gently, gang?

02:23.611 --> 02:25.679
-Your food is soulless.
-Totally uninspired.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.648
-It's got no heart!
-Oh.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.082
Sorry, Mom.

02:29.183 --> 02:30.384
JEFF: It's poop food!

02:30.484 --> 02:32.052
Jeff!
20 minutes!

02:32.152 --> 02:33.854
JEFF: Life is so unfair!

02:33.954 --> 02:36.424
Don't feel bad, Mom.
Cooking's just not your thing.

02:36.524 --> 02:37.825
You can always
join us here,

02:37.925 --> 02:39.360
for what we call
"Cracker Hour."

02:39.460 --> 02:41.495
Oh, but it's so much more
than crackers.

02:41.595 --> 02:44.031
There's cheeses,
toasted Pringles,

02:44.131 --> 02:46.166
and sumptuous
summer sausages.

02:46.267 --> 02:49.770
Hillshire Farms has put
more love into this Li'l Smoky

02:49.870 --> 02:52.706
than in a thousand
of your "dinners."

02:52.806 --> 02:54.775
I don't want to be
bad at cooking.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.410
I want to be
good at cooking.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.846
Why not do a cooking course
at the Learning Annex?

02:58.946 --> 03:00.614
You tell them what
you want to learn,

03:00.714 --> 03:03.384
they look it up on the Internet,
and then they teach it to you.

03:03.484 --> 03:06.119
You know what?
I will do that.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.756
Sorry I drove you guys
underground.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.692
JEFF: I scratched myself
on a nail!

03:11.792 --> 03:14.428
(chuckles) Gotta watch out
for those nails.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.730
Hold up --
do my eyes spy

03:16.830 --> 03:18.366
a Li'l Smoky
in the dirt?

03:19.767 --> 03:22.736
-Dad, are you okay?
-There's a nail in his head!

03:22.836 --> 03:24.538
-Why isn't he speaking?
-Somebody do something!

03:24.638 --> 03:26.274
This is literally
the first time tonight...

03:26.374 --> 03:27.275
-HAYLEY: Aw, Dad!
-STEVE: He's so still!

03:27.508 --> 03:28.376
...I've reached for the
Li'l Smokys and not bumped

03:28.742 --> 03:29.310
-into Stan's head.
-HAYLEY: Blink if you
can hear me!

03:29.877 --> 03:30.378
-STEVE: He's so calm!
-HAYLEY: He's not blinking!

03:32.746 --> 03:34.782
**

03:34.882 --> 03:35.783
Don't worry.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.785
Stan's walking around
and everything,

03:37.885 --> 03:38.986
but he hasn't said a word,

03:39.086 --> 03:41.722
so you know that nail's
touching something important.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.924
You want to talk about
touching a nerve --

03:44.024 --> 03:47.428
you guys not liking my cooking
has really rattled me.

03:47.528 --> 03:50.998
Yes, yes it is me.
Miss Nadine.

03:51.098 --> 03:53.000
Yeah, Nadine!

03:53.100 --> 03:56.404
Today, we're making a classic
spaghetti and meatballs.

03:56.504 --> 03:58.672
Every step is on
these recipe cards,

03:58.772 --> 03:59.940
except for one --

04:00.040 --> 04:01.442
enjoy yourself!

04:01.542 --> 04:03.611
I'll just follow
the steps on the card,

04:03.711 --> 04:05.446
if that's okay with you.

04:05.546 --> 04:08.516
Oh, man,
that babe Danuta's here!

04:08.616 --> 04:10.918
I'm gonna make a cool face
while I chop my onion.

04:12.686 --> 04:16.023
Is she looking?
Is this face cool?

04:16.123 --> 04:18.926
Hmm.
My cup has a dent in it.

04:19.026 --> 04:21.028
Won't be accurate.

04:21.128 --> 04:23.263
I'll have to use
48 teaspoons.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.165
(gasps)

04:25.265 --> 04:28.302
Ms. Nadine!
Dick's not measuring his salt.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.504
Oh. Well, that's fine.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.706
He just squeezed a lemon
in there.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.207
That's not in
the recipe.

04:34.308 --> 04:36.009
Your back was turned
and he squeezed it!

04:36.109 --> 04:38.178
-I saw!
-I thought a hit of lemon

04:38.278 --> 04:40.180
would brighten up
the marinara.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.550
Mmm.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.217
Ooh.
That's a nice change, Dick.

04:44.318 --> 04:47.688
There's no lemon anywhere
in this recipe.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.290
Has the whole world
gone crazy?

04:50.391 --> 04:52.493
(sobbing)
Danuta...

04:52.593 --> 04:56.464
Look at me,
Danuta.

04:56.564 --> 04:58.899
**

04:58.999 --> 05:02.336
The nail has only pierced
his speech centers.

05:02.436 --> 05:05.072
I can yank it out with
my Leatherman, no problem,

05:05.172 --> 05:07.741
but not until the brain swelling
goes down.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.377
Bigger question --

05:09.477 --> 05:12.380
would you be willing
to let me have the brain?

05:12.480 --> 05:15.215
Keep in mind, I'd replace it
with a bag of sand

05:15.315 --> 05:18.185
so his overall weight
would not change --

05:18.285 --> 05:19.219
No.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.188
How long will it take
the swelling to go down?

05:21.288 --> 05:23.691
One week.

05:23.791 --> 05:27.528
I'll put this tiny safety cone
on it for now,

05:27.628 --> 05:30.864
but as your physician,
I must advise that you,

05:30.964 --> 05:35.936
as soon as possible,
get him a fun new hat.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.506
It's a Bugle snack.

05:38.606 --> 05:39.873
Mm. It's delicious.

05:39.973 --> 05:43.110
Hooraaaaay!

05:45.012 --> 05:48.181
Mmm. I know
I keep saying this,

05:48.281 --> 05:50.618
but, to quote
Dom DeLuise's tombstone,

05:50.718 --> 05:52.853
great meatball.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.391
And...
what is this?

05:57.491 --> 05:59.026
It's also a meatball.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.227
Oh.

06:00.327 --> 06:01.529
It's good.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.431
Hey!
Tell me the truth.

06:03.531 --> 06:04.532
I can take it.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.066
Okay.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.468
It's a little bland.

06:07.568 --> 06:08.902
(screams)

06:09.002 --> 06:10.971
-It was your recipe!
-(glass shatters)

06:11.071 --> 06:13.140
And I followed it
to the letter!

06:13.240 --> 06:15.943
-(glass shatters)
-I want a 40% refund!

06:16.043 --> 06:17.878
Get her out of here!

06:17.978 --> 06:20.814
(grunting)
Let me tell you something.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.550
Oh, yeah? What?

06:22.650 --> 06:26.053
This whole Annex
is gonna burn,

06:26.153 --> 06:28.288
and you're gonna
be in it.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.257
You can't burn brick,
bitch!

06:30.357 --> 06:33.260
Oh, I'll find a fire
hot enough.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.429
You're gonna pop
like popcorn.

06:35.529 --> 06:38.131
Pop!
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop!

06:38.231 --> 06:41.669
(jazz music plays)

06:41.769 --> 06:43.504
Now it's time
for a new segment

06:43.604 --> 06:45.172
that I'm really excited
about...

06:45.272 --> 06:48.008
-So (bleep) excited.
-...where I travel the globe

06:48.108 --> 06:50.077
interviewing
famous chefs.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.846
Here's me with
Patagonian super chef,

06:52.946 --> 06:54.448
Francis Mallmann.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.917
Super chef?

06:57.017 --> 06:59.620
As I say in my book,
The Seven Fires,

06:59.720 --> 07:01.154
the problem
with the home cook

07:01.254 --> 07:03.791
is that they are enslaved
by the recipes,

07:03.891 --> 07:06.460
by their electric stoves.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.328
MALLMANN: In the out of doors,
where I cook,

07:08.428 --> 07:10.798
man is returned
to what is essential.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.666
The fire Promethean.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.935
It's all in my book,
The Seven Fires.

07:17.370 --> 07:21.141
Well, the results are in.
Slap bracelets are back.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.510
What the hell?!

07:22.610 --> 07:24.177
Damn thing made me look
like an idiot.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.313
Wow, you're reading
Francis Mallmann?

07:26.413 --> 07:29.783
Yeah, but his cooking is all
about trusting your instincts,

07:29.883 --> 07:31.719
and I don't know
if I have those.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.787
What if you could
learn instincts

07:33.887 --> 07:35.823
from someone
like Francis Mallmann?

07:35.923 --> 07:37.558
Oh, my God.
Do you know him?

07:37.658 --> 07:40.460
Yes, but we're estranged.
I said someone like him.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.563
I have a persona
that borrows heavily

07:42.663 --> 07:44.331
from Francis --
duplicates him really,

07:44.431 --> 07:45.533
probably the source
of the rift --

07:45.633 --> 07:47.467
and I do know
that persona.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.537
Would you be willing to go
all the way to Patagonia

07:49.637 --> 07:50.838
to learn how to cook?

07:50.938 --> 07:54.041
Roger, I'd go to
freakin' L.L. Bean

07:54.141 --> 07:55.809
if it helped me be
a better cook.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.511
Ha! That's hilarious.

07:57.611 --> 08:02.149
Although maybe you
aren't being hilarious.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.519
Now, Francine,
when we get there,

08:05.619 --> 08:07.020
this guy's gonna be me.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.388
I want to be
clear about that.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.490
This persona and I
are different,

08:10.591 --> 08:11.725
but I am him.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.493
I can imagine
how jarring it is

08:13.594 --> 08:15.729
to find me around every corner
in your life,

08:15.829 --> 08:17.698
and I want this
to be a smoother deal for you.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.066
(birds chirping)

08:19.166 --> 08:20.734
This is it, right?

08:20.834 --> 08:23.236
I'm about to look over,
and he'll be there,

08:23.336 --> 08:24.538
and you'll be gone.

08:24.638 --> 08:25.539
Yeah.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.407
You know, I don't usually
get to say goodbye.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.544
Well, thanks for
flying down with me.

08:30.644 --> 08:33.080
Even if you had to come anyway
to be the guy.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.715
Thanks.

08:34.815 --> 08:38.619
I'm Frenchus Mallmank,
not Francis Mallmann,

08:38.719 --> 08:39.920
and I'm going to challenge

08:40.020 --> 08:41.922
everything you know
about cooking.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.090
(gasps)

08:43.190 --> 08:44.257
Goodbye!

08:44.357 --> 08:46.093
(sighs) Alright.

08:46.193 --> 08:49.096
That's enough
turning around.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.401
**

08:54.501 --> 08:56.136
NARRATOR: Frenchus Mallmank

08:56.236 --> 08:58.772
rejected the pathway
of fine French cuisine,

08:58.872 --> 09:02.943
and dedicated himself to
powerful, primitive cooking.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.145
On his island in Patagonia,

09:05.245 --> 09:07.147
with his dedicated students,

09:07.247 --> 09:09.216
he makes incredible meals

09:09.316 --> 09:12.385
using little more
than fire and salt...

09:12.485 --> 09:15.989
and the world
has taken notice.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.558
(exasperatedly)
Would you shut up!

09:18.659 --> 09:20.794
Why are you narrating
everything?

09:20.894 --> 09:22.930
And the narrator
withdrew,

09:23.030 --> 09:25.766
shutting himself off
from human connection --

09:25.866 --> 09:27.500
Good!
I think that's good.

09:27.601 --> 09:28.669
There.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.104
That is how you build...

09:31.204 --> 09:33.240
the Eight Fires.

09:33.340 --> 09:36.443
**

09:36.543 --> 09:39.346
Yes.
One more than Francis.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.248
Now I'll teach my techniques,

09:41.348 --> 09:43.316
all leading up
to a grand feast.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.453
I will try each of your dishes,
finishing many of them,

09:46.553 --> 09:47.988
and see how much
you learned.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.322
Lesson one!

09:49.422 --> 09:51.024
I'm sealing this fish

09:51.124 --> 09:53.861
in the rich cream mud
that is here by my feet.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.629
When I cook this in the fire,

09:55.729 --> 09:57.931
the mud will
hold in the moisture.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.467
-It will also muffle
the small screams of the fish...
-(high-pitched squealing)

10:00.567 --> 10:02.035
...as it suffers and dies.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.972
Oh! How many cups
of mud is that?

10:05.072 --> 10:07.507
You have long fingers,
and it looks like a lot.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.376
No cups!
No recipes!

10:09.476 --> 10:13.981
Cooking is about
being free and alive.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.683
No!

10:15.783 --> 10:18.451
Eh?
You like my trebuchet?

10:18.551 --> 10:19.953
**

10:20.053 --> 10:21.388
-(piano plays)
-Alright.

10:21.488 --> 10:24.024
Let's find Dad a hat
to cover up that nail.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.492
(piano continues)

10:25.592 --> 10:27.227
You like
the piano, Dad?

10:27.327 --> 10:30.030
You can wait here
while we shop for hats,

10:30.130 --> 10:32.132
and I won't have
to look at the nail.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.968
Hey, look who it is!

10:35.068 --> 10:38.471
(piano continues)

10:38.571 --> 10:40.140
-10 minute break.
-(piano stops)

10:40.240 --> 10:43.711
Just enough time for a cigarette
and a tuna-fish sandwich.

10:47.580 --> 10:50.550
(piano plays)

10:50.650 --> 10:51.685
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:51.785 --> 10:54.054
I am manager
of this Nordstrom,

10:54.154 --> 10:56.924
and that is simply
gorgeous playing.

10:57.024 --> 10:57.925
You're hired.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.827
And you're fired.

10:59.927 --> 11:03.096
Does Dick's Sporting Goods
have piano players?

11:03.196 --> 11:04.732
Dad can't play piano.

11:04.832 --> 11:07.500
It's the nail.
It's unlocking him.

11:07.600 --> 11:11.338
My nail gives me the power to
know all domestic flight times

11:11.438 --> 11:14.174
within the United States.

11:14.274 --> 11:18.511
United 12 leaves Dulles
for O'Hare in 30 minutes.

11:18.611 --> 11:21.414
No. Not even close.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.116
(sizzling)

11:25.719 --> 11:28.255
Come, my acolytes.
Taste.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.190
You just got a bunch
of dirt in it.

11:30.290 --> 11:33.193
That's earth,
and earth is flavor and passion.

11:33.293 --> 11:36.296
Think of how many people
had sex on this earth.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.231
And on Earth!

11:38.331 --> 11:40.367
(whispering) I found
a little piece that's clean.

11:40.467 --> 11:41.969
A little dirt for ya!

11:42.069 --> 11:44.104
-(fire crackling)
-To cook meat over flame,

11:44.204 --> 11:45.906
to me, I believe truly --

11:46.006 --> 11:48.541
Can't find the neck hole
in this poncho. There it is.

11:48.641 --> 11:51.144
The best technique
is spatchcocking.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.445
(whispering)
I've done that.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.547
It's when you
intentionally graze

11:54.647 --> 11:56.583
someone's penis
with your backpack.

11:56.683 --> 11:59.586
Spatchcocking is when you
flatten an animal's ribcage

11:59.686 --> 12:01.221
so that it cooks more evenly.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.990
I'll show you.

12:03.090 --> 12:07.227
It's all about finding just
the right point of pressure,

12:07.327 --> 12:09.662
feeling it,
making that connection,

12:09.763 --> 12:10.931
and then spatchcock!

12:12.165 --> 12:13.834
This works
with any meat.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.235
Wild hare...

12:16.103 --> 12:17.504
river otter...

12:18.738 --> 12:19.807
two chickens.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.442
Usually, you want to prep it,
get the guts out,

12:22.542 --> 12:24.011
but I was just
feeling it too hard.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.445
Had to do a live spatchcock.

12:25.545 --> 12:28.448
ROGER: So it goes.
Eight fires, etcetera, etcetera.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.851
With food,
you need a little wine.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.286
This, to me,
is a little wine.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.755
This is the largest size
bottle of wine

12:35.856 --> 12:37.257
that isn't legally a vat.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.259
It is called...
a nebuchadnezzar.

12:39.359 --> 12:42.329
I drink four of these a day,
just like Charlemagne did,

12:42.429 --> 12:43.696
and I'll outlive you all.

12:43.797 --> 12:45.999
What is it the poets
say about wine?

12:46.099 --> 12:48.035
(belches)

12:48.135 --> 12:50.537
What?
Did you say something?

12:50.637 --> 12:51.538
Was I still going?

12:51.638 --> 12:52.806
Well, you're a fool

12:52.906 --> 12:54.842
if you don't saber
your nebuchadnezzars.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.815
I can't tell if it's done.

13:01.915 --> 13:04.852
Maybe I should
check real quick.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.186
ROGER: It's ruined.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.721
The precious juice
has been drained.

13:08.822 --> 13:12.292
Taste yours.

13:12.392 --> 13:13.693
Now try mine.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.163
Mmm.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.998
It's so good.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.532
You're resisting
my lessons.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.902
I hope you can show me something
at the big feast.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.204
Now, if you excuse me,
I must slumber

13:24.304 --> 13:26.339
and dream of
spatchcocking T-rexes

13:26.439 --> 13:29.142
with my childhood friend,
Jean-Baptiste.

13:29.242 --> 13:32.212
(piano plays)

13:32.312 --> 13:34.414
(giggles) Business
has never been better,

13:34.514 --> 13:36.049
and it's all thanks to you!

13:36.149 --> 13:40.320
Sales figures correspond 100%
with your piano playing!

13:40.420 --> 13:41.989
I don't want any
of this stuff.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.523
(up-tempo piano plays)

13:43.623 --> 13:45.993
I'm buying
10 winter coats!

13:46.093 --> 13:47.327
(laughs)

13:47.427 --> 13:49.029
You hooked another one,
Nailhead!

13:49.129 --> 13:51.564
And you know how big
the margins are on coats.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.500
(chuckles)
Oh, oh!

13:53.600 --> 13:56.536
By the way, I got a call
from corporate earlier.

13:56.636 --> 13:59.506
They're considering turning
the Langley Falls location

13:59.606 --> 14:01.774
into the new flagship...

14:01.875 --> 14:03.210
(piano continues)

14:03.310 --> 14:04.611
Yes.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.279
Flagship.

14:06.379 --> 14:09.516
That's what all this
has been about.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.518
Now, play me
to the break room,

14:11.618 --> 14:15.455
this time in the style
of a silent-movie villain.

14:15.555 --> 14:19.259
(staccato notes play)

14:25.298 --> 14:29.937
Javier, your Potatoes Three Ways
is delicious, inspired.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.939
What would you say
to another three-ways

14:32.039 --> 14:33.273
in my big fur bed?

14:33.373 --> 14:35.275
-No.
-You deny me?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.877
My passion grows like a bonfire!

14:37.978 --> 14:39.146
Anywho, moving on.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.248
I was having
a tough time at first,

14:41.348 --> 14:45.152
but I think I finally
cooked from...here.

14:45.252 --> 14:46.886
Promising.

14:51.724 --> 14:52.993
Where are they?

14:53.093 --> 14:54.394
Where are what?

14:54.494 --> 14:56.964
The measuring cups
that you used to make this!

14:57.064 --> 14:58.331
You're right!

14:58.431 --> 15:00.133
I cheated.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.102
I've been doing
so terribly.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.737
Oh, why can't I understand
how to cook?!

15:04.837 --> 15:05.838
Who cares about that?!

15:06.139 --> 15:08.475
I launched those measuring cups
all the way to Bear Island.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.777
If you went there,
it's possible "they"

15:10.877 --> 15:12.279
followed your scent
back here.

15:12.379 --> 15:13.280
Who?

15:13.380 --> 15:14.514
(bears growl)

15:15.848 --> 15:18.785
Acolytes,
fly me to safety!

15:18.885 --> 15:21.521
JAVIER: We'll tell the world
your story!

15:21.621 --> 15:24.324
But I already told the world
my story.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.493
(bears growl)

15:26.593 --> 15:28.295
Roger, what do we do?

15:28.395 --> 15:30.363
(whispering) Stand perfectly
still and don't make a sound.

15:30.463 --> 15:33.133
(sniffing)

15:33.233 --> 15:35.202
-Yes, it's me.
-(roars)

15:35.302 --> 15:37.704
(screaming)

15:37.804 --> 15:40.207
**

15:40.307 --> 15:41.841
-(growls)
-(screaming continues)

15:41.941 --> 15:46.279
**

15:46.379 --> 15:48.448
(coughs)

15:48.548 --> 15:51.151
That damn bear
spatchcocked me.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.620
I wish I wasn't here
right now.

15:53.720 --> 15:57.124
I wish I was
in a restaurant.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.794
**

16:01.894 --> 16:03.696
Roger!
Are you okay?

16:03.796 --> 16:05.898
They told me Bear Island
would be a problem

16:05.999 --> 16:07.067
when I bought this place.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.169
"Leave the bears to me,"
I said.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.571
What did I even mean?
I didn't have a plan.

16:11.671 --> 16:12.839
This is all my fault.

16:12.939 --> 16:14.374
It's not your fault.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.709
You weren't there
when I bought the island.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.145
I mean,
if I hadn't cheated,

16:18.245 --> 16:20.180
the bears never
would have come here.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.082
You killed me.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.484
Let's see how badly
you're hurt.

16:24.584 --> 16:25.885
What's the damage?

16:25.985 --> 16:28.521
Will I ever be able
to rollerblade again?

16:28.621 --> 16:31.191
(sighing) Oh.
That bear really got you.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.026
We need to get you
off this island,

16:33.126 --> 16:34.394
but the boat is gone.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.663
There's a backup boat
on the other side of the island.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.231
Oh, my God!

16:38.331 --> 16:40.333
Wait, why do you
have a backup boat?

16:40.433 --> 16:43.670
You should be asking,
why do I have three boats.

16:43.770 --> 16:48.241
Because I used to,
but then I ended up selling one.

16:48.341 --> 16:53.513
-(grunts)
-Ow. Ow. Ow.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.715
Wait!
My nebuchadnezzars!

16:55.815 --> 16:58.851
-(glass clinking)
-Ow. Ow.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.587
Wait, my gaucho hat!

17:02.189 --> 17:05.892
(strained) You know, Francine,
I think I'm ready to die.

17:05.992 --> 17:08.795
there's just one last thing
I want to do --

17:08.895 --> 17:10.930
drink a live-forever potion.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.201
You're not gonna die.
We've reached the boat.

17:14.301 --> 17:15.868
Wait.
There's somebody in it.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.638
ROGER: Oh, no.
It's Francis Mallmann.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.574
You stole my identity,
Frenchus Mallmank,

17:21.674 --> 17:24.977
and now I steal
your boat!

17:27.914 --> 17:29.316
(piano plays)

17:29.416 --> 17:31.818
**

17:31.918 --> 17:34.554
Money! Oh, money!
Oh, money!

17:34.654 --> 17:36.223
(chuckles)
We're rich!

17:36.323 --> 17:39.058
This branch of Nordstrom
is rich!

17:39.159 --> 17:41.428
-Oh, no. The family.
-It's been a week.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.163
We have to take
the nail out now.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.132
Otherwise, he'll die,
right, Dr. Kalgary?

17:45.232 --> 17:46.299
Sounds right.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.068
Then you must take it out.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.070
I'd never want
Nailhead to die.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.505
Because, you see,

17:52.605 --> 17:54.907
it wasn't about the money
or the coat sales --

17:55.007 --> 17:56.809
the highest in
the tri-county area.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.246
It was about the music.

17:59.346 --> 18:03.950
So before you remove the nail,
could I hear just one last song?

18:04.050 --> 18:07.120
Dad!
One more song!

18:07.220 --> 18:08.755
(piano plays melancholy tune)

18:08.855 --> 18:12.359
No boats. No food.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.294
We're both gonna
starve here.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.129
I'm surprised
I made it this far

18:16.229 --> 18:19.299
with the amount of glass
I've been drinking.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.334
Before we die,

18:21.434 --> 18:24.003
why did you cheat
with the measuring cups?

18:24.103 --> 18:25.938
I didn't want to mess up,
I guess.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.875
What would it mean
if you messed up?

18:28.975 --> 18:30.877
That there
was something wrong

18:30.977 --> 18:33.012
with the measurements
or the recipe.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.383
And what if you messed up
without a recipe?

18:36.483 --> 18:37.950
What if it was just you,

18:38.050 --> 18:40.353
cooking,
making your own decisions?

18:40.453 --> 18:43.690
It'd mean that there was
something wrong with me,

18:43.790 --> 18:45.358
that I was the failure.

18:45.458 --> 18:49.329
And that's what therapists
call a babababingo.

18:49.429 --> 18:50.897
(coughs)

18:50.997 --> 18:54.501
Roger, this leg
is starting to turn.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.369
I think
I should cut it off.

18:56.469 --> 19:00.173
If you're gonna cut off my leg,
you need to cook it.

19:00.273 --> 19:01.874
Roger, that's crazy!

19:01.974 --> 19:04.143
It'll keep me from dying
of blood poisoning

19:04.244 --> 19:06.479
and give us both
something to eat.

19:06.579 --> 19:07.847
Oh, I don't know.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.982
There is no recipe
for cooking my leg,

19:10.082 --> 19:11.384
no safety net.

19:11.484 --> 19:15.021
Show me who you are
and feed me me.

19:15.121 --> 19:18.358
(piano continues)

19:18.458 --> 19:21.994
**

19:22.094 --> 19:25.665
**

19:25.765 --> 19:27.500
(groaning)

19:27.600 --> 19:33.273
**

19:33.406 --> 19:39.045
**

19:39.178 --> 19:44.884
**

19:45.017 --> 19:46.052
I had a lemon.

19:46.152 --> 19:51.758
**

19:51.891 --> 19:57.597
**

19:57.730 --> 20:03.403
**

20:03.503 --> 20:05.272
It's delicious, Franny.

20:05.372 --> 20:09.642
**

20:09.742 --> 20:12.379
-(body thuds)
-(dissonant notes play)

20:12.479 --> 20:14.581
Hey, I'm back, baby.

20:14.681 --> 20:17.250
No! Put it back in!
Put it back in!

20:17.350 --> 20:18.751
(manager screams)

20:20.753 --> 20:22.322
-(screaming continues)
-(customers shout indistinctly)

20:22.422 --> 20:25.658
Don't worry!
I'll make you a monster!

20:25.758 --> 20:28.094
Billy, get the van!

20:28.194 --> 20:32.432
Ah, it feels good
to have conquered this.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.734
I was letting
my fear of failing

20:34.834 --> 20:36.636
make me a boring cook.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.305
(bears growl)

20:38.405 --> 20:39.639
(screams)

20:39.739 --> 20:41.508
No! Don't fight them.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.010
Feed them.

20:44.110 --> 20:45.478
(bear growls)

20:45.578 --> 20:47.614
ROGER: Hey, it's Francis.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.148
The smell of
your soulful cooking

20:49.248 --> 20:50.950
lured him back, Francine.

20:51.050 --> 20:54.153
And I've hit
my goal weight.

20:54.253 --> 20:57.524
Roger, your body's gonna
grow back, right?

20:57.624 --> 20:59.526
It always has before.

20:59.626 --> 21:02.128
Oh, God!
What if it doesn't?!

21:02.228 --> 21:04.130
Have a good night!

21:06.198 --> 21:08.000
