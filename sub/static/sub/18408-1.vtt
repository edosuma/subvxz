02:13.968 --> 02:16.000
Buzz off.

02:24.968 --> 02:27.693
Willie. 6:30.

02:29.335 --> 02:31.235
Willie?

02:31.335 --> 02:33.367
Right.

03:46.168 --> 03:48.166
Stage fright, Willie?

03:50.434 --> 03:52.500
Come on. Move it.

04:11.734 --> 04:13.800
Coming out.

04:16.767 --> 04:18.833
Right.

04:41.034 --> 04:45.801
Your last address was 77
A Eton Grove, South Norwood?

04:45.901 --> 04:47.801
Yes, sir.

04:47.901 --> 04:50.200
And would it be true
to say, Mr. Parker...

04:50.300 --> 04:52.734
that for a good many years now
you have made your living...

04:52.834 --> 04:55.801
solely as a hardened
professional criminal?

04:55.901 --> 04:58.024
Yes, sir, I regret to say.

04:59.034 --> 05:02.068
Afternoon of the 23rd
of September, 1971.

05:02.168 --> 05:05.667
Barclays Bank branch
in Beavers Road, East Dulwich.

05:05.767 --> 05:08.834
- You participated in that raid, Mr. Parker?
- Yes, sir.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.300
And who were your confederates
on that occasion?

05:13.400 --> 05:15.601
Hopwood, Riordan...

05:15.701 --> 05:18.701
Fellows, Mr. Corrigan.

05:18.801 --> 05:21.168
Who did what?

05:21.268 --> 05:23.334
What?

05:28.168 --> 05:31.257
I stayed with the car, and...

05:32.901 --> 05:35.868
Lenny, Jimmy and Jeff went in the bank.

05:35.968 --> 05:38.300
- And Corrigan?
- He got the money.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.667
All of it?

05:40.767 --> 05:43.068
- No.
- You shared it out, didn't you?

05:43.168 --> 05:45.068
Yeah.

05:45.168 --> 05:48.234
- But Corrigan got the lions share.
- Right.

05:48.334 --> 05:50.501
'Cause he was the mastermind
behind the operation.

05:50.601 --> 05:54.690
Yeah. See, Mr. Corrigan...

05:56.601 --> 05:58.834
Yeah. Mastermind.

05:58.934 --> 06:01.734
Morning of the 25th of October, 1972.

06:01.834 --> 06:05.601
The Securicor van in Peckham High Road.

06:05.701 --> 06:07.734
A guard was wounded.

06:07.834 --> 06:10.467
- You took part?
- Yes, sir.

06:10.567 --> 06:15.234
And Riordan, Fellows and Mr. Corrigan.

06:15.334 --> 06:18.128
- Not Hopwood.
- No, sir.

06:19.234 --> 06:23.034
I think...
I think Lenny had flu that day.

06:24.418 --> 06:25.893
Or cold feet.

06:26.834 --> 06:28.868
Who fired at the guard?

06:28.968 --> 06:31.434
That was Riordan.

06:31.534 --> 06:33.501
Finally, Mr. Parker...

06:33.601 --> 06:35.734
I will ask you this:

06:35.834 --> 06:38.134
In agreeing to give your evidence...

06:38.234 --> 06:40.768
have you been influenced
by any promises...

06:40.868 --> 06:43.093
of immunity from prosecution...

06:44.101 --> 06:48.701
or special treatment
at the hands of the police or of the court?

06:48.801 --> 06:51.068
No, sir.

06:51.168 --> 06:54.167
I'm here, and I'm saying this...

06:54.267 --> 06:56.267
because I think I should.

06:56.367 --> 06:58.334
I think it's right.

06:58.434 --> 07:02.601
Very well, Parker. You may stand down.

07:02.701 --> 07:05.266
Thank you, milord.

07:06.300 --> 07:09.100
We'll meet again

07:09.200 --> 07:12.868
Don't know where
Don't know when

07:12.968 --> 07:18.434
But I know we'll meet again
some sunny day

07:18.534 --> 07:21.467
Keep smiling through

07:21.567 --> 07:24.300
Just like you used to do

07:24.400 --> 07:27.501
'Cause I know we'll meet again

07:27.601 --> 07:30.467
Some sunny day

07:30.567 --> 07:33.134
We'll meet again

07:33.234 --> 07:36.391
Don't know where
Don't know when

07:37.601 --> 07:41.929
But I know we'll meet again
some sunny day

08:54.601 --> 08:57.534
- Oh. Qué tal?
- Hola. Qué tal?

09:05.767 --> 09:09.731
- Hola. Qué tal? Qué desea?
- Café solo.

09:40.434 --> 09:42.062
Muerto.

10:09.033 --> 10:11.067
- Hola, Willie.
- Hey. Hola.

10:11.167 --> 10:14.067
- Cómo estás?
- Bien. Señor Juan.

10:14.167 --> 10:16.067
Qué hay?

10:16.167 --> 10:18.234
- Muy elegante?
- Ay. Muy elegante.

10:18.334 --> 10:22.196
- Cómo se dice en español?
- Los negocios de vivir.

10:38.801 --> 10:40.867
Mr. Parker!

10:41.801 --> 10:43.867
Mr. Parker!

10:46.200 --> 10:48.266
Mr. Parker!

11:58.334 --> 11:59.923
Juan!

16:55.534 --> 16:57.600
Go.

17:01.873 --> 17:02.933
¡Dinero!

17:40.700 --> 17:42.666
Come on.

17:42.766 --> 17:45.466
Can I open the window?

17:45.566 --> 17:48.098
- Enough.
- Ta.

18:02.867 --> 18:04.933
Sorry, Mr. Braddock.

18:06.867 --> 18:08.933
Mr. Braddock.

19:20.100 --> 19:22.825
But I know we'll meet a...

19:28.367 --> 19:31.331
Some sunny day

19:41.600 --> 19:44.900
- What you grinning at, asshole?
- Sorry.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.300
Got nothing to smile about, mate,
if you knew.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.833
If I knew?

19:49.933 --> 19:52.533
He thinks I don't know.

19:52.633 --> 19:55.267
If I knew.

19:55.367 --> 19:58.331
Where's Mr. Corrigan? London?

20:04.399 --> 20:07.761
Have you fellas got a boat
stashed away somewhere?

20:09.033 --> 20:11.500
No. Can't see it.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.134
And we're traveling north.

20:14.234 --> 20:18.732
No. I'd say a quick run up through France
and then over the drink.

20:19.733 --> 20:23.466
That's your only problem, seems to me...
getting me over the water.

20:23.566 --> 20:26.167
Yeah, well, Corrigan ain't in London.
He's in Paris.

20:26.267 --> 20:29.094
- Myron.
- Sorry, Mr. Braddock.

20:30.433 --> 20:32.366
Myron.

20:32.466 --> 20:35.260
That's an unusual name. Myron.

20:36.766 --> 20:38.900
Well, Paris.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.900
So...

20:41.000 --> 20:43.167
cross the frontier at...

20:43.267 --> 20:45.333
Where?

20:45.433 --> 20:47.900
Somewhere quiet?

20:48.000 --> 20:52.900
Up through France, should get
to Paris, 5:00, 6:00 in the morning.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.531
Quick word with Mr. Corrigan and then...

20:56.533 --> 20:58.599
lights out, Willie.

20:59.600 --> 21:02.134
The executioner...

21:02.234 --> 21:04.357
and his assistant.

21:05.566 --> 21:07.600
Yeah, well, if you know,
it ain't funny, is it?

21:07.700 --> 21:09.766
Isn't it?

21:11.900 --> 21:14.933
- I'll tell you something I read once, Myron.
- You.

21:15.033 --> 21:17.466
Parker, Mr. Braddock.

21:17.566 --> 21:19.767
Willie Parker.

21:19.867 --> 21:21.933
You.

21:23.033 --> 21:25.000
Shut your mouth.

21:25.100 --> 21:27.995
Get some practice in?

21:45.433 --> 21:48.033
El residente inglés William Parker...

21:49.080 --> 21:50.600
Hey. Fame.

21:54.167 --> 21:58.033
- Juan Velásquez...
- Poor old Juan.

21:58.133 --> 22:01.466
Seems those fellas who picked me up
swiped him on the way out.

22:01.566 --> 22:03.700
I thought we hit something... somebody.

22:03.800 --> 22:07.400
- Swiped who?
- Juan. Juan velásquez. He's a cop.

22:07.500 --> 22:12.134
En un Dodge color marrón,
con licencia número 33-00-21.

22:12.234 --> 22:14.134
Got the car number.

22:16.299 --> 22:20.199
They expect to make arrests at any moment,
and there's a reward for information.

22:20.299 --> 22:23.767
- Turn it off. What cop?
- Nobody said nothing to us about no filth.

22:23.867 --> 22:26.833
A new addition, when they heard
Mr. Corrigan was getting out.

22:26.933 --> 22:29.433
- Spanish cop?
- Favor from the Guardia Civil.

22:29.533 --> 22:31.833
He's lying, Mr. Braddock.

22:31.933 --> 22:35.067
- You fuck! You're lying!
- Why would I do that?

22:35.167 --> 22:38.000
Of course he is.
He's shitting us. He's winding us up.

22:38.100 --> 22:40.067
- Turn off the road, next exit.
- Mr. Braddock...

22:40.167 --> 22:42.067
Do it.

22:42.167 --> 22:44.528
There's no bloody exits.

24:04.900 --> 24:07.166
We got no problem, Mr. Braddock.

24:07.266 --> 24:10.730
It's only those Spanish geezers
could finger us, and we took care of them.

24:13.766 --> 24:15.832
Didn't we?

24:18.000 --> 24:20.466
Let's do him here.

24:20.566 --> 24:22.632
It's as good a place as any.

24:25.566 --> 24:27.928
Get the fuck out of this country.

24:30.533 --> 24:33.166
We'll get another car.

24:33.266 --> 24:35.264
Yeah.

24:37.766 --> 24:39.733
Can't be too careful.

24:39.833 --> 24:41.092
Shut up!

24:43.033 --> 24:45.360
Risky, innit, boss?

24:50.433 --> 24:52.733
- We'll go to Madrid.
- Madrid?

24:52.833 --> 24:54.233
Madrid.

24:54.333 --> 24:56.456
Fuck this! I've had enough.

25:10.867 --> 25:13.330
I'll get back in the car then?

25:17.199 --> 25:20.356
- He's up to something.
- What did you do?

25:22.099 --> 25:24.165
Yeah, I know.

25:25.099 --> 25:27.133
He's up to something!

25:27.233 --> 25:29.231
Is he?

25:30.166 --> 25:32.232
Is he?

25:46.633 --> 25:49.500
- Where to, Mr. Braddock?
- Left.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.996
Oh. It's ages since I've been to Madrid.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.032
And again with Ditchburg.
Once again, Madden wins it.

27:25.132 --> 27:28.233
And again...
No, it's kept in play this time. Kerry.

27:28.333 --> 27:30.900
Attempted smother by Shodum.

27:31.438 --> 27:33.366
Beauty. Ripper.

27:33.466 --> 27:35.566
...into the goal square.

27:35.666 --> 27:37.566
Volls will get there first.

27:38.332 --> 27:40.528
Good chipper by Bradbury.

27:40.999 --> 27:43.466
- Hello, sweetheart?
- Trying to find Watson or Heard.

27:43.566 --> 27:46.266
They're both there.
Took McConkel out of business.

27:46.366 --> 27:48.767
It's three on one out there
and picked up by Weston.

27:48.867 --> 27:51.633
Kicked towards center field. Bandahar.

27:51.733 --> 27:53.832
Oh, fuck.

27:58.533 --> 28:00.599
Oh! What a steal from Ryan!

28:04.032 --> 28:06.099
I know you, don't I?

28:06.199 --> 28:08.500
It's Mr. Mitchell, isn't it?

28:08.600 --> 28:11.133
- No.
- Sure it is.

28:11.233 --> 28:13.133
Tony Mitchell.

28:13.233 --> 28:16.266
Mitch. You remember me, Mitch? Harry.

28:16.366 --> 28:18.266
Rome.

28:18.366 --> 28:21.932
- You remember me. Harry.
- What you doing here?

28:22.032 --> 28:25.066
Well, sort of borrowing the place.

28:25.166 --> 28:28.466
It's all right though, Mitch.
Bruno knows.

28:28.566 --> 28:31.799
Oh. Well, no, he don't, actually.

28:31.899 --> 28:34.466
He gave me, the keys
a couple of years ago...

28:34.566 --> 28:37.032
and, I had to leave
where I was in a hurry.

28:37.132 --> 28:39.790
And I thought that Bruno
wouldn't mind...

28:40.932 --> 28:44.600
- I wasn't expecting to find anybody here.
- Yeah, well, why should you?

28:44.700 --> 28:47.433
- Yeah. That's why the gun.
- Yeah, I can see that.

28:47.533 --> 28:49.433
I mean, it's a social call, isn't it?

28:49.533 --> 28:53.866
I mean, you drop in on a friend,
and you know the flat should be empty...

28:53.966 --> 28:56.899
and, you find
this bugger installed here.

28:56.999 --> 28:59.499
Well, naturally you're gonna...

28:59.999 --> 29:01.966
Well, I mean, if you're...
if you're carrying one.

29:02.066 --> 29:04.266
Means nothing? That's clear.

29:08.366 --> 29:10.299
Australian Rules.

29:10.399 --> 29:12.863
I get 'em sent over every week.

29:13.932 --> 29:16.233
My name's Harry. I know Mitch.

29:16.333 --> 29:18.799
I don't know you though, mate, do I?

29:18.899 --> 29:22.233
- No.
- Oh. I don't know you either.

29:22.333 --> 29:24.666
But... what's in a name?

29:24.866 --> 29:28.633
Three friends of, Bruno's...
All friends of Bruno's.

29:28.733 --> 29:30.799
Good old Bruno.

29:31.733 --> 29:33.966
How's it been, Mitch?

29:34.066 --> 29:36.132
My name's Willie Parker.

29:37.932 --> 29:40.294
You've probably
read about me in the paper.

29:42.132 --> 29:44.198
You bastard.

29:46.899 --> 29:50.133
I didn't hear that, Mitch.
He's a joker, right?

29:50.233 --> 29:53.566
He's a bloody clown. I swear to you, Mitch.
I never heard his name.

29:53.666 --> 29:55.566
- Willie Parker.
- Shut up.

29:55.666 --> 29:58.890
- Shut up! What are you trying to do to me?
- Not trying to do anything to you, Harry.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.799
I don't know you're on a job.

30:02.899 --> 30:04.899
I don't know nothing.

30:05.599 --> 30:07.167
I haven't read the paper.

30:07.267 --> 30:09.491
I'll burn the fucking paper.

30:21.233 --> 30:23.663
No, look. Don't.

30:25.466 --> 30:27.899
Maggie, I want you to meet some friends.

30:27.999 --> 30:30.133
Amigos, okay?

30:30.233 --> 30:32.265
Son buenos amigos.

30:33.199 --> 30:35.966
Mi estimado amigo Mr. Mitchell...

30:36.066 --> 30:39.032
and, these are some other friends.

30:39.132 --> 30:40.891
Hola.

30:44.166 --> 30:47.857
Won't be for us.
I don't take calls here.

30:49.199 --> 30:52.133
Look. Why don't we...
Why don't we have a beer?

30:52.233 --> 30:54.133
Nice, cold beer all around.

30:54.233 --> 30:56.326
Talk this thing out.

30:57.566 --> 30:59.932
- I could do with a beer, Mr. Braddock.
- Great.

31:00.032 --> 31:02.832
That's what we need.
And we can sort it all out.

31:05.999 --> 31:08.533
- Nothing for him.
- Oh, let bygones be bygones.

31:08.633 --> 31:10.533
A beer, a chat.

31:10.633 --> 31:13.221
Maggie, tres cervezas. Pronto. Okay?

31:14.533 --> 31:17.292
Sit, sit. Get comfy.

31:27.666 --> 31:31.632
- She's called Maggie?
- Magdalena María Victoria Morales.

31:31.732 --> 31:33.999
Beautiful, isn't it? But a mouthful.

31:34.099 --> 31:36.165
I call her Maggie.

31:37.299 --> 31:39.333
She's been with me for a year.

31:39.433 --> 31:41.499
Best year I ever had.

31:44.233 --> 31:46.166
How old would you say she was?

31:46.266 --> 31:48.732
I don't give a toss how old she is.

31:48.832 --> 31:50.732
Nineteen?

31:50.832 --> 31:53.160
How about 16?

31:55.399 --> 31:57.465
How about 15?

32:02.100 --> 32:03.689
Not bad for an old fart, is it?

32:05.799 --> 32:08.266
I suppose you're wondering
what she sees in me. Well...

32:08.366 --> 32:11.199
money obviously,
but it's more than that.

32:11.299 --> 32:13.365
It's a real bond.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.299
She was in bad shape when I met her.

32:16.399 --> 32:18.665
Beautiful little kid
running wild in the streets.

32:18.765 --> 32:21.299
Comes from an excellent family.
So she tells me.

32:21.399 --> 32:23.296
Brother's a priest. All that.

32:23.999 --> 32:27.466
But, you know, death, disaster...

32:27.566 --> 32:29.466
unfortunate investments.

32:29.566 --> 32:31.899
One minute she's a little princess
up in the hill...

32:31.999 --> 32:35.395
next she's down there working the bars,
doing the best she can.

32:36.333 --> 32:38.331
This is Spain.

32:39.333 --> 32:41.990
- Why don't you shut up?
- I can't!

32:51.765 --> 32:54.500
Did you know I'd moved to Madrid, Mitch?

32:54.600 --> 32:56.799
Mitch and me are old mates from Rome.

32:56.899 --> 32:59.400
He helped some associates of mine
with a problem they were having.

32:59.500 --> 33:03.759
You know how it is. A few greedy buggers
messing it up for everybody else.

33:04.699 --> 33:07.133
Well, old Mitch come in one weekend...

33:07.233 --> 33:09.231
sorted it out.

33:15.132 --> 33:17.032
- Gracias.
- Oi.

33:17.132 --> 33:19.198
De nada.

33:22.366 --> 33:25.261
I'll just leave it here.
Whenever you're ready, Mitch.

33:38.333 --> 33:40.399
Car keys?

33:41.333 --> 33:43.799
The garage has got 'em, Mitch.

33:43.899 --> 33:46.532
I've been using the car a little bit.

33:46.632 --> 33:50.032
I thought Bruno would be glad to have
the motor turned over once in a while.

33:50.132 --> 33:52.465
If you want the car,
have to phone down for it.

33:52.565 --> 33:55.496
- Tell them to bring it round.
- Right. Sure.

34:20.831 --> 34:22.966
Bringing it straight round, Mitch.
It's a white Mercedes.

34:23.065 --> 34:25.188
I know what it is.

34:26.199 --> 34:29.565
Carburetor's a bit dicey.
I was gonna have it serviced, but I didn't.

34:29.665 --> 34:31.831
You leaving straightaway?
Oh, that's too bad.

34:31.931 --> 34:34.293
Madrid's a fabulous city, and the...

34:41.899 --> 34:43.760
Go on.

35:07.532 --> 35:09.598
Hey.

35:37.665 --> 35:39.731
I don't deserve this, Mitch.

35:41.832 --> 35:43.898
Do you like...

35:44.999 --> 35:46.966
the girl?

35:47.066 --> 35:49.133
Maggie?

35:49.233 --> 35:52.465
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

35:52.565 --> 35:55.995
I mean, she's got a hell of a temper
sometimes, but we get along.

35:57.565 --> 35:59.631
I think I finally struck it lucky.

36:00.866 --> 36:02.864
Gonna have to take her, Harry.

36:05.899 --> 36:08.488
Best I can do for you.

36:12.866 --> 36:15.732
Well, it'll shut me up. That's for sure.

36:15.832 --> 36:18.194
Not that I'd, you know...

36:26.866 --> 36:29.057
I appreciate it, Mitch.

36:30.799 --> 36:32.865
How long will you keep her?

36:36.132 --> 36:38.959
She'll be all right. She's a good kid.

36:43.699 --> 36:47.163
I guess I was just in the wrong place,
wrong time.

36:49.233 --> 36:51.299
Yeah.

36:52.599 --> 36:55.599
Get the girl. We're taking her with us.

36:55.699 --> 36:57.632
Is that gonna work, Mr. Braddock?

36:57.732 --> 36:59.632
Get the girl!

36:59.732 --> 37:01.798
You, the bags.

37:06.832 --> 37:09.499
Harry. Harry!

37:09.599 --> 37:11.377
Harry.

37:14.233 --> 37:16.866
- Harry!
- You.

37:16.966 --> 37:19.233
Tell this whore
that we're just about to go out...

37:19.333 --> 37:22.565
and if she doesn't behave herself,
then I'm gonna get very angry.

37:22.665 --> 37:25.027
I don't think I need to tell her.

37:26.732 --> 37:28.798
Good.

37:49.776 --> 37:51.165
That's enough.

38:18.432 --> 38:20.828
I'm sure true love will see us through.

38:22.565 --> 38:24.631
Even with a reward.

38:32.565 --> 38:34.499
- Wait.
- Mr. Braddock.

38:34.599 --> 38:37.188
Wait.

39:00.199 --> 39:02.457
I didn't talk to 'em, Mitch.

39:03.465 --> 39:05.656
Didn't have time.

39:18.298 --> 39:21.099
Fair old reward though, isn't it?

39:21.199 --> 39:23.265
Have to be careful.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.865
Want a drink?

39:35.832 --> 39:37.898
Shall we watch the game?

40:04.465 --> 40:06.832
That's my team, Mitch.

40:06.932 --> 40:08.998
Hawthorn.

40:11.066 --> 40:13.132
They're losing.

40:17.066 --> 40:20.165
Two points for Edwards at the
seven-and-a-half minute mark...

40:20.265 --> 40:23.766
of the second, quarter
of the elimination final for 1983...

40:23.866 --> 40:27.165
and, the Blues still bouncing back.

40:57.565 --> 40:59.631
Everything all right, Mr. Braddock?

41:31.532 --> 41:34.723
Aw, look. She's terrified.

41:35.866 --> 41:38.898
Don't worry.
You're... You're in safe hands.

41:41.866 --> 41:44.065
She doesn't understand
a word I'm saying.

41:44.165 --> 41:46.697
- Do you want me to translate?
- No.

41:48.765 --> 41:51.399
She's a pretty little thing, isn't she?

41:51.499 --> 41:53.565
She's wasted on that Aussie.

41:55.131 --> 41:58.699
Now you'd have thought
he'd taught her a bit of English.

41:58.799 --> 42:01.165
- Do you speak any English?
- Qué?

42:01.265 --> 42:04.332
English. Do you speak any English?

42:04.432 --> 42:07.726
Oh. Yes. English.

42:10.432 --> 42:12.332
Fair dinkum.

42:12.432 --> 42:15.899
Jesus. I'm horny.

42:18.565 --> 42:20.631
Well, it's coming along.

42:22.265 --> 42:24.558
I think she's taken a fancy to me.

42:53.565 --> 42:56.165
Wait here.

42:59.165 --> 43:01.832
Out. Come on. Out.

43:01.932 --> 43:03.832
Qué pasa?

43:25.504 --> 43:26.499
No!

43:27.556 --> 43:29.411
What are you doing?

43:30.832 --> 43:32.998
What does it look like I'm doing?

43:33.098 --> 43:36.898
We can't take her with us,
and we can't let her go.

43:38.403 --> 43:41.931
- ¡Oye! Mira. Margarita.
- Por qué?

43:42.031 --> 43:44.332
Así es la vida.

43:45.158 --> 43:46.799
Por qué?

43:46.899 --> 43:49.632
But what about Harry?
He'll talk as soon as he finds out.

43:49.732 --> 43:51.865
Harry's dead.

43:52.365 --> 43:55.298
- What?
- So we don't need her.

43:55.398 --> 43:58.259
You. Get away from her.

44:02.131 --> 44:04.031
No.

44:04.131 --> 44:06.288
No. No!

44:30.232 --> 44:32.696
Take 'em both to the car.

44:52.931 --> 44:55.088
He should have killed them both
together in the flat.

44:56.165 --> 44:59.365
I don't know.
It's supposed to be quick, clean work.

44:59.465 --> 45:02.031
Look at him now. Australians, women.

45:02.131 --> 45:04.031
It's not his fault. It's an accident.

45:04.131 --> 45:07.391
Yeah, but he's not meant
to have accidents.

45:10.332 --> 45:12.660
Perhaps he's slipping.

45:13.931 --> 45:17.499
- Yeah, well, I ain't slipping.
- Well, I'm counting on that, son.

45:17.599 --> 45:19.665
Get inside.

45:34.599 --> 45:37.332
You all right, Mr. Braddock?

45:38.155 --> 45:39.798
Dios.

45:39.898 --> 45:42.298
The grass was trying to wind me up.

45:42.398 --> 45:44.298
I told him.

45:44.398 --> 45:46.464
Shut him up.

45:51.131 --> 45:53.798
We'll take care of her later?

45:53.898 --> 45:55.964
When it's dark.

45:58.365 --> 46:01.165
You sure we gotta take care of her?

46:01.265 --> 46:06.365
I mean, we can't just find
somewhere quiet, let her go?

46:06.465 --> 46:09.656
- I ain't going soft or nothing.
- She's seen me.

46:13.432 --> 46:15.691
It's gonna be all right,
innit, Mr. Braddock?

46:22.499 --> 46:24.565
Sure.

46:47.732 --> 46:49.990
I don't understand what she's saying.

46:55.131 --> 46:58.632
She wants to stop, do some shopping.

46:58.732 --> 47:02.499
- What?
- She needs to get some new clothes.

47:02.599 --> 47:05.065
What for?

47:05.165 --> 47:07.527
She had a bit of an accident back there.

47:08.499 --> 47:10.565
Christ.

47:13.031 --> 47:15.188
How about it, Mr. Braddock?

47:16.232 --> 47:18.457
It can't be very comfortable.

47:23.465 --> 47:25.531
Well, I don't want to sit next to it.

47:32.031 --> 47:34.427
I think we should stop.

47:54.332 --> 47:56.232
- Size 10, mate.
- Oh.

47:56.332 --> 47:58.398
Hope they fit.

48:04.165 --> 48:05.931
It's the best I could find.

48:06.031 --> 48:08.029
These are fine.

48:29.465 --> 48:32.326
Think we should find
a rubbish dump or something.

48:43.465 --> 48:45.698
That could have been a mistake,
Mr. Braddock.

48:45.798 --> 48:47.887
Could have been a clue or something.

49:19.232 --> 49:21.230
Buenos días, inspector.

49:38.365 --> 49:40.431
I don't know what's wrong with it.

49:44.532 --> 49:47.465
I know I said I knew about cars,
but I don't really.

49:47.565 --> 49:50.998
- Well, not a lot.
- Shall I give it a try?

49:51.098 --> 49:53.720
- You know about cars then?
- Well, I was a driver, wasn't I?

50:07.931 --> 50:10.395
- Shut up.
- Give it a try.

50:17.499 --> 50:19.399
And again.

50:21.865 --> 50:23.931
Okay. Give us a tick.

50:48.198 --> 50:50.264
Couple of minutes, Mr. Braddock.

50:51.831 --> 50:53.829
So far, so good, hey?

51:00.764 --> 51:02.762
Right, Myron.

51:10.365 --> 51:13.098
Nice one, fearless.

51:13.198 --> 51:15.598
It'd kill him to thank me, wouldn't it?

51:16.098 --> 51:18.164
No lip, you.

51:29.131 --> 51:31.561
I don't half fancy a beer, Mr. Braddock.

51:32.764 --> 51:34.830
All right, beers all around then.

51:55.698 --> 51:57.560
You all right?

52:06.332 --> 52:08.398
Four beers, please, mate.

52:08.498 --> 52:10.831
- Cómo?
- Four beers.

52:14.898 --> 52:17.198
- Four. Four beers.
- Cerveza?

52:17.298 --> 52:19.398
That's it. Four.

52:19.498 --> 52:21.655
- Cuatro cervezas.
- Yeah.

52:30.065 --> 52:31.364
All right.

52:33.468 --> 52:34.749
All right.

52:38.664 --> 52:41.855
Mister. Mister!

52:44.598 --> 52:46.664
Cuatro cervezas.

53:54.764 --> 53:56.732
Yahoo!

54:18.598 --> 54:20.687
Oh, Christ! That felt good.

54:45.998 --> 54:49.564
This country goes on and on forever,
don't it?

54:49.664 --> 54:51.631
There's another one.

54:51.731 --> 54:53.765
How comes they got
so many castles then, hey?

54:53.865 --> 54:55.863
It's the route of the invaders.

54:57.498 --> 55:01.724
They came through these mountains...
Romans, Gauls, Napoléon.

55:02.965 --> 55:05.297
The Pass of Roncesvalles.

55:05.397 --> 55:08.089
- What?
- They fought the Saracens here.

55:09.131 --> 55:11.526
- Who did?
- Roland and Oliver.

55:12.998 --> 55:15.165
Knights of old, Myron.

55:15.265 --> 55:18.765
Great warriors, great chiefs.

55:18.865 --> 55:20.765
Great friends.

55:20.865 --> 55:26.330
They fought together, and
they died together...

55:32.098 --> 55:35.498
Why'd you do it, Willie?
Why'd you grass?

55:35.598 --> 55:38.187
Oh, I couldn't go back to nick.
Couldn't.

55:39.464 --> 55:41.865
Then they came up with this deal.

55:41.965 --> 55:43.865
Was this a deal?

55:43.965 --> 55:45.865
This wasn't no ticket to Canada
and good-bye.

55:45.965 --> 55:48.031
This was a lifetime.

55:48.131 --> 55:50.254
Nobody ever got a deal like that.

55:51.731 --> 55:55.731
I was sorry I did it though...
for the fellas.

55:55.831 --> 55:58.031
This ain't no better
than the nick, is it?

55:58.131 --> 56:00.031
This?

56:00.531 --> 56:02.288
This is nothing.

57:29.164 --> 57:32.031
The boss seems to be holding up
all right, don't you think?

57:32.131 --> 57:34.364
A moody sod. That's for sure.

57:34.464 --> 57:39.531
Well, 700 miles to go to Paris,
frontier to cross.

57:39.631 --> 57:41.765
Can't say I blame him really.

57:41.865 --> 57:43.863
I wonder if he's up to it.

57:45.831 --> 57:49.498
I think so. I think he is.

57:49.598 --> 57:51.898
- All right. I want to know!
- Know what?

57:51.998 --> 57:53.698
You've had something going
from the start.

57:53.798 --> 57:55.765
You've got a plan.
I want to know now, or I swear...

57:55.865 --> 57:58.197
- I haven't got any plan.
- What you so happy about?

57:58.297 --> 58:00.197
- What's going on?
- Nothing's going on.

58:00.297 --> 58:03.231
- You silly sod! You're gonna die!
- So are you, sooner or later.

58:03.331 --> 58:05.231
You're gonna die fucking soon, mate.

58:05.331 --> 58:07.727
I'll tell you
something I read once, Myron.

58:09.631 --> 58:11.531
Apparently what happens to you
after death...

58:11.631 --> 58:16.664
is not all that much different
from what happens to you before death...

58:16.764 --> 58:19.197
physically speaking.

58:19.297 --> 58:21.264
All part of the same process.

58:21.364 --> 58:23.362
You know?

58:24.531 --> 58:29.256
So if it's all the same, really,
what's there to worry about?

58:33.698 --> 58:35.696
You're barmy.

58:37.698 --> 58:41.331
Don't worry about me, Myron.
Worry about you.

58:41.431 --> 58:43.331
Are you really up to this?

58:43.431 --> 58:45.827
- I ain't worried about me.
- Good.

58:46.831 --> 58:48.931
Then worry about your boss.

58:49.031 --> 58:52.731
Is this job getting him down?
Is he making the right decisions?

58:52.831 --> 58:56.056
Are you gonna have to take over
at some time or another?

58:56.998 --> 59:00.359
Think about it.
We don't want anything going wrong.

59:07.631 --> 59:09.629
You got bird shit in your hair.

59:13.297 --> 59:15.363
Well, well.

59:33.831 --> 59:37.488
You're no 15-year-old. What are you?

59:44.097 --> 59:46.823
You think my little friend Myrors
gonna save you?

01:00:18.231 --> 01:00:20.025
You bitch.

01:00:58.464 --> 01:01:03.064
Mr. Braddock? Do you think we could
stop for something to eat soon?

01:01:03.164 --> 01:01:06.164
I ain't had nothing all day,
and I'm really hungry.

01:01:06.264 --> 01:01:08.164
Expect I'm not the only one.

01:01:08.264 --> 01:01:10.564
Her too. She's probably hungry and all.

01:01:10.664 --> 01:01:12.825
She's already eaten.

01:01:15.564 --> 01:01:19.531
I'm gonna stop soon.
We'll stay off the road till after dark.

01:01:19.631 --> 01:01:21.531
Sort of a lot of hanging about, innit?

01:01:21.631 --> 01:01:26.464
Yeah. I had hoped
to cross the frontier this evening.

01:01:26.564 --> 01:01:29.255
Bit safer. They like to stay
in their huts when it's dark.

01:01:30.964 --> 01:01:34.690
Had to make a few diversions.
You would have your fun and games, Myron.

01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:53.097
- You're not eating, Mr. Braddock.
- I'm going to get some petrol.

01:02:53.197 --> 01:02:55.797
We've got enough petrol
to get to France, haven't we?

01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:57.896
I want to get well inside France.

01:03:02.264 --> 01:03:04.830
- I'll take her along.
- What for?

01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:07.930
So I can watch her.
And you can watch him.

01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:09.930
Why don't you take him along?
I'll watch her.

01:03:10.030 --> 01:03:12.764
Because, Myron, I think she might
distract you from your job.

01:03:12.864 --> 01:03:14.424
Come on.

01:03:15.664 --> 01:03:20.297
Mr. Braddock, I've been thinking.
I don't think anything should happen to her.

01:03:20.397 --> 01:03:23.364
Now's as good a time as any, Myron.

01:03:23.464 --> 01:03:25.797
It's not fair.

01:03:25.897 --> 01:03:28.797
It's not fair?

01:03:28.897 --> 01:03:31.297
No, Mr. Braddock, it isn't.

01:03:31.397 --> 01:03:35.631
I mean, him... he's a fucking grass.
He put his mates inside.

01:03:35.731 --> 01:03:37.797
But her... she ain't done nothing.

01:03:46.631 --> 01:03:48.629
You're just not thinking right.

01:03:50.064 --> 01:03:52.153
The job's got you down.

01:03:53.264 --> 01:03:56.626
I mean, I'm game for anything,
but, Christ, there's a limit.

01:03:58.698 --> 01:04:00.854
You're just not thinking right.

01:04:13.797 --> 01:04:15.830
Here.

01:04:15.930 --> 01:04:18.155
Make you feel safer, won't it, Myron?

01:04:30.164 --> 01:04:32.162
Here.

01:04:39.264 --> 01:04:41.864
Put her in the car, Myron.

01:04:41.964 --> 01:04:44.030
Well, go on then!

01:04:46.631 --> 01:04:49.197
Now, Mr. Braddock. Here you are.

01:04:49.297 --> 01:04:50.731
You!

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:53.830
Spanish for "Fill the tank."

01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:56.364
Lleno, por favor.

01:04:56.464 --> 01:04:58.462
I'm sorry, Mr. Braddock.

01:05:07.697 --> 01:05:09.696
Well, eat your food then!

01:05:20.964 --> 01:05:24.053
He'll kill you if you hurt me.

01:05:25.431 --> 01:05:27.497
Who, Myron?

01:05:29.598 --> 01:05:31.664
What an idea.

01:05:41.531 --> 01:05:43.529
Oi.

01:05:44.564 --> 01:05:46.721
- Where you going?
- Look at the water.

01:06:05.397 --> 01:06:09.088
Hey. Let's have a look at your cosh.

01:06:10.264 --> 01:06:12.262
Feel this.

01:06:14.331 --> 01:06:16.012
Razor blades.

01:06:19.498 --> 01:06:22.030
What for?

01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:24.398
- I still got a gun, you know.
- Guns.

01:06:24.498 --> 01:06:26.154
Right.

01:06:27.164 --> 01:06:29.064
- Leather?
- Yeah.

01:06:29.164 --> 01:06:31.162
- What's it filled with?
- Sand.

01:06:34.064 --> 01:06:36.062
That's enough.

01:06:39.431 --> 01:06:42.663
Had it since I was at school, for years.

01:06:42.763 --> 01:06:47.091
Made it in handicrafts.
Never lets me down.

01:06:48.663 --> 01:06:50.662
Nice place.

01:06:51.797 --> 01:06:56.056
I tell you what. I think you're crazy,
but I admire your attitude.

01:07:01.764 --> 01:07:04.092
I don't know, this whole thing...
it's not turning out like I thought it would,

01:07:04.192 --> 01:07:06.888
not at all.
It's my first time, you know.

01:07:07.089 --> 01:07:10.301
It's like a test, Mr. Braddock said.
If I do well on this one,

01:07:10.401 --> 01:07:12.931
- he'll take me along on his other jobs.
- And if you don't?

01:07:13.031 --> 01:07:14.531
- Don't what?
- Do well.

01:07:14.631 --> 01:07:16.897
At least I got a grand
for this one, ain't I?

01:07:19.231 --> 01:07:21.593
I want you to know,
when you get the chop...

01:07:23.264 --> 01:07:26.864
When it happens, I'm not going
to be enjoying meself.

01:07:26.964 --> 01:07:28.997
That's a comfort.

01:07:29.097 --> 01:07:31.797
- I wouldn't worry.
- I ain't worried.

01:07:31.897 --> 01:07:36.327
I mean, he needs you to drive
and to watch me.

01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:39.398
So you're safe till Paris at least.

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.680
Well, we're both safe till Paris.

01:07:43.763 --> 01:07:45.852
You did take a bit of a risk though.

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:49.497
Do you think she's worth it?

01:07:49.597 --> 01:07:52.231
I mean, we don't want
anything going wrong, and...

01:07:52.331 --> 01:07:54.329
she is in the way.

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:58.297
You're no different from him, are you?

01:07:58.397 --> 01:08:00.730
I don't see how you reckon that.

01:08:00.830 --> 01:08:03.123
She's got nothing to fear from me.

01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:07.696
I think I'll have a lie-down.

01:08:18.363 --> 01:08:20.863
Keep smiling through

01:08:20.964 --> 01:08:23.586
Just like you used to do

01:08:39.697 --> 01:08:41.763
Lleno.

01:09:26.130 --> 01:09:27.662
- ¡Socorro! ¡Ayúdame!
- You bi...

01:09:27.763 --> 01:09:29.497
¡Socorro! ¡Ayúdame!

01:09:29.596 --> 01:09:31.754
¡Corre! ¡El teléfono!

01:09:44.997 --> 01:09:47.063
Cerdo.

01:10:04.197 --> 01:10:05.762
Policía.

01:11:01.663 --> 01:11:03.197
¡No!

01:11:04.929 --> 01:11:06.358
¡No!

01:11:32.396 --> 01:11:35.485
¡No! ¡No!

01:12:08.864 --> 01:12:11.296
¡Asesino!

01:12:11.396 --> 01:12:14.156
¡Diablo! ¡Hijo de puta! ¡Basura!

01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:19.397
Dios.

01:12:19.942 --> 01:12:21.563
¡Dios mío!

01:12:26.097 --> 01:12:30.925
Let me go. Please! Let me go.

01:12:33.844 --> 01:12:35.952
Please.

01:13:05.164 --> 01:13:07.388
Where is he?

01:13:09.997 --> 01:13:11.995
Jesus. I don't know.

01:13:13.630 --> 01:13:15.628
Watch her.

01:14:35.129 --> 01:14:37.128
We're moving out.

01:14:57.463 --> 01:14:59.256
Climb down.

01:16:47.897 --> 01:16:50.029
What's she saying?

01:16:50.129 --> 01:16:53.697
She's saying, if we both jump the boss
together, one of us might live.

01:16:56.497 --> 01:16:59.830
- I've got a gun here.
- Then use it on him.

01:17:02.163 --> 01:17:04.161
He's my partner.

01:17:05.196 --> 01:17:08.091
- ¡Estúpido!
- You're crazy.

01:17:09.129 --> 01:17:12.830
Look, calm down. Let's be sensible.

01:17:12.930 --> 01:17:15.757
I'm gonna have a word with him
about you anyway.

01:17:17.530 --> 01:17:19.430
He'll see reason. I know he will.

01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:22.061
Willie, I don't know about you,
as it's a job.

01:17:23.296 --> 01:17:25.896
I tell you what.
I got a feeling about situations.

01:17:25.996 --> 01:17:29.221
And I don't think anything's
gonna happen, not really.

01:17:30.597 --> 01:17:32.595
I just don't believe it.

01:17:33.897 --> 01:17:36.020
Will you help me?

01:17:39.797 --> 01:17:41.692
¡Ay!

01:18:12.230 --> 01:18:15.263
Why didn't you make a run for it
when you had the chance?

01:18:15.363 --> 01:18:18.697
What for? You'd have found me again.

01:18:18.797 --> 01:18:20.863
Would've got the boy into trouble.

01:18:22.163 --> 01:18:24.929
I'm not scared.

01:18:25.029 --> 01:18:28.163
- You've gotta be.
- Why?

01:18:28.263 --> 01:18:32.163
'Cause everyone else is? 'Cause you are?

01:18:32.263 --> 01:18:34.625
You don't know...

01:18:42.896 --> 01:18:45.622
- Death...
- Is just a stage in the journey.

01:18:47.363 --> 01:18:50.861
We're all gonna get there.
No exceptions.

01:18:52.163 --> 01:18:54.695
Me and you and...

01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:58.263
It's just a moment.

01:18:58.363 --> 01:19:00.730
We're here.

01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:02.996
Then we're not here.

01:19:03.096 --> 01:19:05.094
We're somewhere else...

01:19:06.697 --> 01:19:08.126
maybe.

01:19:10.530 --> 01:19:12.619
And it's as natural as breathing.

01:19:13.863 --> 01:19:15.930
Why should we be scared?

01:19:19.029 --> 01:19:22.425
I was scared, at first.

01:19:24.129 --> 01:19:26.863
I was dead scared.

01:19:26.963 --> 01:19:29.497
I knew Corrigan
would come after me one day...

01:19:29.597 --> 01:19:32.263
or send someone.

01:19:32.363 --> 01:19:35.029
I've had 10 years to get ready for this.

01:19:35.129 --> 01:19:38.457
I thought, and I read.

01:19:39.396 --> 01:19:41.792
Must've read a whole library of things.

01:19:43.463 --> 01:19:45.461
Amazing things.

01:19:48.996 --> 01:19:50.994
Amazing.

01:19:52.863 --> 01:19:57.763
In the end, the only thing
that really worried me...

01:19:57.863 --> 01:20:00.521
was that he'd send
some rubbish after me.

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:05.597
And I thought, if I got somebody good...

01:20:05.697 --> 01:20:10.130
somebody who could do the job proper...

01:20:10.230 --> 01:20:12.660
then I could do my bit.

01:20:20.129 --> 01:20:22.563
Did you ever...

01:20:22.663 --> 01:20:27.996
Did you ever call yourself,
something like Walsh, Wallace...

01:20:28.096 --> 01:20:30.094
something like that?

01:20:32.196 --> 01:20:34.662
- Wallace maybe.
- Yeah.

01:20:35.062 --> 01:20:36.662
Thought so.

01:20:36.762 --> 01:20:39.230
I met you once in the old days.

01:20:39.330 --> 01:20:42.828
Well, we was in the same room together.

01:20:43.762 --> 01:20:45.761
Yeah. I remembered you.

01:20:49.829 --> 01:20:51.828
You didn't remember me though.

01:20:59.963 --> 01:21:01.961
What's your real name?

01:21:06.029 --> 01:21:07.996
Braddock.

01:21:15.863 --> 01:21:18.486
Nothing I can do about this.
You know that.

01:21:34.263 --> 01:21:37.591
I read this in a magazine
when John Lennon died.

01:21:39.796 --> 01:21:42.230
"Death, be not proud...

01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:45.029
"though some have called thee
mighty and dreadful...

01:21:45.129 --> 01:21:47.195
"for thou art not so;

01:21:48.497 --> 01:21:52.296
"for those whom thou think'st
thou dost overthrow...

01:21:52.396 --> 01:21:54.896
"die not, poor Death...

01:21:54.996 --> 01:21:57.994
nor yet canst thou kill me."

01:22:12.497 --> 01:22:14.495
You gonna kill the girl?

01:22:23.363 --> 01:22:25.429
I don't think she's ready.

01:22:44.396 --> 01:22:46.462
Ten miles to the border, Mr. Braddock.

01:22:49.829 --> 01:22:51.895
We'll pull over soon.

01:23:45.230 --> 01:23:47.496
I've locked him in.

01:23:47.596 --> 01:23:49.496
He's still sleeping.
He's a brave man, ain't he?

01:23:49.596 --> 01:23:52.163
Seems so.

01:23:52.263 --> 01:23:54.329
We'll do him here.

01:23:55.796 --> 01:23:57.862
How about her?

01:24:02.263 --> 01:24:04.363
I'll do 'em both.

01:24:04.463 --> 01:24:06.363
Thanks, Mr. Braddock.

01:24:06.463 --> 01:24:08.896
I don't think I could've done it really.

01:24:08.996 --> 01:24:11.096
It's my first time, innit?

01:24:11.196 --> 01:24:13.319
Won't be needing a gun then, will you?

01:24:17.996 --> 01:24:20.796
Don't suppose you could help me
get them out of the car?

01:24:20.896 --> 01:24:22.894
Oh. Sure.

01:24:24.497 --> 01:24:26.563
Do I still get my thousand?

01:24:43.230 --> 01:24:45.055
Well, come on then.

01:24:46.929 --> 01:24:49.257
It's all right, love. It's all right.

01:24:50.496 --> 01:24:53.085
Valor. Ten mucho valor.

01:25:05.163 --> 01:25:07.296
I wish I could have made her understand.

01:25:07.396 --> 01:25:09.296
And you too, Willie.

01:25:09.396 --> 01:25:11.961
"Willie." Thanks.

01:25:12.896 --> 01:25:15.292
I said you too.

01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:18.752
What is it?

01:25:19.929 --> 01:25:21.927
I'm gonna do it now, Willie.

01:25:22.929 --> 01:25:24.829
What?

01:25:24.929 --> 01:25:27.362
I'm gonna do it now.

01:25:28.147 --> 01:25:29.596
Not me.

01:25:29.696 --> 01:25:31.596
Yes.

01:25:31.696 --> 01:25:34.263
- Now?
- Right.

01:25:34.363 --> 01:25:37.562
No, it's tomorrow.
You're doing it tomorrow.

01:25:37.662 --> 01:25:39.660
It's tomorrow, Willie.

01:25:41.562 --> 01:25:44.963
You've gotta take me to Corrigan.
You've gotta get me to Paris.

01:25:45.063 --> 01:25:47.096
I'm gonna do it now.

01:25:47.196 --> 01:25:50.829
That's not the job.
The job ends in Paris.

01:25:50.929 --> 01:25:54.330
- You're not doing the job.
- Come on, Willie.

01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:55.968
No.

01:25:57.796 --> 01:26:00.862
You can't. You've gotta get me to Paris.

01:26:01.996 --> 01:26:03.896
Not till Paris.

01:26:03.996 --> 01:26:05.896
You can't.

01:26:05.996 --> 01:26:08.230
Not now.

01:26:10.330 --> 01:26:12.328
Oh, God.

01:26:13.666 --> 01:26:15.196
Myron.

01:26:15.296 --> 01:26:17.763
Stop him.

01:26:17.863 --> 01:26:20.230
Oh, God. Please!

01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:23.562
Willie. You mouth.

01:26:23.662 --> 01:26:26.557
You can't. Not now!

01:26:35.308 --> 01:26:36.900
¡Dios!

01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:44.029
Where you going?

01:26:44.129 --> 01:26:46.592
I don't want to see... What's this?

01:27:31.029 --> 01:27:32.604
Enough.

01:27:34.863 --> 01:27:37.259
Enough. Enough!

01:27:49.896 --> 01:27:52.629
Oh. Oh, aye.

01:27:52.729 --> 01:27:56.096
You're a very lucky girl.

01:27:57.685 --> 01:27:59.819
Very lucky girl.

01:30:57.696 --> 01:30:59.596
Es él.

01:30:59.696 --> 01:31:02.629
- Estás segura?
- Sí.

01:31:02.729 --> 01:31:04.727
Capitán. Dé las órdenes.

01:31:16.529 --> 01:31:19.496
Mr. Braddock! Stand just where you are!

01:31:33.329 --> 01:31:35.229
The exit!

01:31:35.329 --> 01:31:37.496
Hey?

01:31:37.596 --> 01:31:39.529
Exit? Exit!

01:31:40.832 --> 01:31:42.161
Ex...

01:32:09.095 --> 01:32:11.991
¡No disparen! ¡Alto!

01:32:36.095 --> 01:32:40.218
You are Charles Kinnear, born in Dublin?

01:32:41.429 --> 01:32:44.121
Just nod if that is true.

01:32:45.896 --> 01:32:51.262
You are Raymond John Baker,
born in Newcastle?

01:32:51.362 --> 01:32:54.062
It's just a moment.

01:32:54.162 --> 01:32:57.896
We're here. Then we're not here.

01:32:57.996 --> 01:33:01.960
We're somewhere else... maybe.

01:33:12.863 --> 01:33:14.929
And it's as natural as breathing.

01:33:15.963 --> 01:33:18.029
Why should we be scared?
