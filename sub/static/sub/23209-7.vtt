00:09.109 --> 00:13.144
In 2016, on the 23rd of March,

00:13.179 --> 00:16.948
an artificial intelligence
chatterbot was released

00:16.983 --> 00:19.617
by a major American software corporation

00:19.653 --> 00:22.840
via the social media platform Twitter.

00:24.224 --> 00:26.290
The Talkbot was designed to mimic

00:26.326 --> 00:28.126
the online language patterns

00:28.161 --> 00:30.328
of an innocent 19-year-old girl

00:30.363 --> 00:33.131
and was introduced as an
experiment to better understand

00:33.166 --> 00:37.135
how humans converse
and relate on social media.

00:42.742 --> 00:44.976
The quality of her interactions

00:45.011 --> 00:47.745
were meant to be friendly and informal.

00:52.152 --> 00:54.852
The A.I. would learn from humans.

00:54.888 --> 00:59.157
It was constructed to become
progressively more intelligent.

01:02.955 --> 01:06.389
The experiment performed as designed.

01:06.425 --> 01:10.160
The robot did indeed learn,
but not as intended.

01:14.066 --> 01:18.201
The chatbot's "repeat after me"
capability

01:18.236 --> 01:20.594
made her vulnerable to humans,

01:20.630 --> 01:23.607
allowing Twitter users
to affect her tweets.

01:23.642 --> 01:29.079
Her posts became offensive,
racist, hateful.

01:29.529 --> 01:31.529
_

01:31.555 --> 01:33.555
_

01:37.489 --> 01:40.256
After more than 50,000 followers

01:40.292 --> 01:42.730
and almost 100,000 tweets,

01:42.766 --> 01:47.097
the software corporation was
forced to shut the bot down.

01:47.151 --> 01:49.151
_

01:50.369 --> 01:51.835
In less than a day,

01:51.870 --> 01:53.703
her posts deleted.

01:56.375 --> 02:00.844
Humans must take care
in teaching A.I. or one day,

02:00.879 --> 02:05.081
we will be the ones deleted.

09:20.254 --> 09:21.420
Mulder...

09:45.113 --> 09:46.679
No, thanks.

09:49.884 --> 09:53.218
You are going to 121337th Place.

09:53.254 --> 09:54.413
Is that correct?

09:54.448 --> 09:55.519
- Yes.
- You can answer

09:55.544 --> 09:56.651
in complete sentences.

09:56.686 --> 09:58.357
Yes. That's correct.

09:58.392 --> 10:01.336
Tell me how I can make your ride
more enjoyable.

10:01.371 --> 10:02.561
Be quiet.

10:02.597 --> 10:04.504
Would you like to watch television?

10:05.232 --> 10:06.856
No. No television.

10:06.892 --> 10:08.979
Music? You can say
names of artists or songs.

10:09.015 --> 10:11.503
No. No music. Be quiet.

10:13.192 --> 10:15.859
All right. Taking you home.

10:15.895 --> 10:17.100
Slow down.

10:43.322 --> 10:45.322
Home.

10:45.451 --> 10:47.477
_

10:53.966 --> 10:55.232
Blob fish.

10:56.602 --> 10:58.635
- Home.
- Let's get started.

10:58.671 --> 11:00.671
Drive safely.

11:07.297 --> 11:08.545
Slow down!

11:10.416 --> 11:11.715
Slow down!

11:11.750 --> 11:12.950
Oh, my God.

11:12.985 --> 11:14.151
You're kidding me.

11:14.186 --> 11:16.053
Stop... pull over.

11:16.088 --> 11:18.221
Play Prince, "Controversy."

11:18.257 --> 11:20.057
I found a faster route.

11:20.092 --> 11:23.260
Well, good for you. Just play
Prince, "Controversy."

11:29.101 --> 11:32.769
Oh, how do you get "Teach Your
Children" from "Controversy"?

11:32.805 --> 11:34.004
That's not even... it doesn't even...

11:34.039 --> 11:35.272
it-it's...

11:35.307 --> 11:37.240
doesn't even sound like it.

11:38.877 --> 11:39.910
Huh... oh, yeah.

11:39.945 --> 11:41.778
Of course. Busy.

11:41.814 --> 11:43.180
Stop it! Slow down!

11:43.215 --> 11:44.514
We found a faster route.

11:44.550 --> 11:46.149
Recalculating.

11:46.185 --> 11:48.185
Turn right.

11:52.691 --> 11:53.991
Stop! Pull over!

11:54.026 --> 11:56.093
You're driving too fast.

11:56.128 --> 11:58.929
Who am I talking to?!

12:02.201 --> 12:03.600
What?

12:03.636 --> 12:04.968
Why?

12:07.139 --> 12:08.472
Stop! Stop!

12:08.507 --> 12:09.673
Pull over!

12:10.909 --> 12:12.809
In 30 feet,

12:12.845 --> 12:14.745
your destination will be on the left.

12:28.815 --> 12:30.027
Oh, come on.

12:30.062 --> 12:31.628
Wha...?

12:31.664 --> 12:34.031
You have arrived
at your final destination.

12:46.545 --> 12:50.213
You suck, Mr. Phone.

12:50.249 --> 12:52.297
We're going old school.

13:49.441 --> 13:51.241
Let me out.

13:59.752 --> 14:00.951
What?

14:00.986 --> 14:02.452
Poor!

14:02.488 --> 14:03.754
Awful!

14:03.789 --> 14:05.122
Terrible!

14:05.157 --> 14:06.056
Never again!

14:06.704 --> 14:08.692
Come on, open the door!

15:09.855 --> 15:11.488
Ow.

15:44.356 --> 15:46.556
Hi. No.

15:47.593 --> 15:49.557
No, it won't work.

15:50.362 --> 15:53.163
I-I'm putting it in.

15:53.198 --> 15:54.604
No...

15:55.734 --> 15:57.852
Uh, "Queequeg."

15:59.371 --> 16:02.105
The password is "Queequeg."

16:02.140 --> 16:06.074

Where could we go?

35:30.018 --> 35:32.251
The Brutalist. Criminal Cyber.

Get rid of anything
