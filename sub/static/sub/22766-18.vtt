WEBVTT

00:01.976 --> 00:05.078
The form asks for an employer.

00:05.113 --> 00:06.480
I'm retired,

00:06.514 --> 00:09.092
so sh... should I just leave it blank?

00:09.124 --> 00:12.092
Sure, they'll figure it out.

00:14.801 --> 00:17.236
- Hey, Emily.
- Hey!

00:17.261 --> 00:18.935
How's the first day going?

00:18.960 --> 00:21.391
I've helped four people
with the vending machine,

00:21.416 --> 00:23.390
three with directions to the cafeteria.

00:23.415 --> 00:25.750
Closing in on 2,000 steps
carrying paperwork.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.810
Oh, and I'm wearing a triple-XL vest,

00:27.834 --> 00:29.367
because the one in my
size has barf on it.

00:29.392 --> 00:30.781
I wish I could say the waiting room

00:30.806 --> 00:33.265
gets more glamorous, but it doesn't.

00:33.290 --> 00:36.673
Yeah.

00:38.633 --> 00:40.534
She's gonna quit.

00:40.568 --> 00:41.935
You don't know that.

00:41.970 --> 00:44.617
Volunteering could be huge for Emily:

00:44.642 --> 00:46.545
responsibility, purpose.

00:46.570 --> 00:48.671
I'm just worried she
won't see it through.

00:48.696 --> 00:50.731
Give her a chance.

00:56.086 --> 00:58.421
Remember those tickets we
bought for The Revivalists?

00:58.455 --> 01:01.344
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, it's next weekend.

01:01.369 --> 01:03.851
Well, you go. Take Jay.

01:04.297 --> 01:06.667
I'm not going on a
date with my brother.

01:06.889 --> 01:08.356
Don't you want them?

01:08.381 --> 01:11.111
I promised Owen I'd
take him to Navy Pier.

01:11.136 --> 01:12.897
You use 'em.

01:17.533 --> 01:19.334
Faster scan rates,

01:19.359 --> 01:21.217
a greater resolution,

01:21.242 --> 01:24.161
a host of diagnostic improvements

01:24.186 --> 01:26.655
in cardiac calcium scoring,

01:26.680 --> 01:28.460
- TAVR planning.
- I get it, okay?

01:28.485 --> 01:31.454
The... the ED would put a
new CT scanner to good use,

01:31.479 --> 01:33.858
but the machine alone's
upwards of $2 million.

01:33.883 --> 01:35.726
Kay, then there's maintenance.
You got tech support...

01:35.751 --> 01:38.300
And higher patient throughput,

01:38.325 --> 01:41.860
wh... which is increased
revenue, Peter. Come on.

01:41.885 --> 01:43.171
I'd go to the board myself,

01:43.196 --> 01:45.329
but considering my stock these days,

01:45.362 --> 01:47.761
it'll sound better coming from you.

01:47.939 --> 01:50.589
Well, so much for a free
cup of coffee, huh?

01:55.203 --> 01:56.603
I need help over here!

02:00.359 --> 02:01.860
What the hell?

02:01.885 --> 02:03.388
We just piled them in and drove.

02:07.089 --> 02:08.564
I need a doctor!

02:08.589 --> 02:10.679
What is going on?

02:10.704 --> 02:12.772
Some lunatic opened fire
with an automatic rifle

02:12.797 --> 02:15.508
- at Millenium Park.
- How many victims?

02:15.867 --> 02:17.348
A lot.

02:19.561 --> 02:26.640
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:27.022 --> 02:28.965
- Clear every treatment room
and trauma bay.

02:28.990 --> 02:30.717
Patients go to the waiting room.

02:30.742 --> 02:32.354
We need more space on the floor.

02:32.379 --> 02:33.859
Chairs, COWs, carts,

02:33.884 --> 02:35.716
pile everything in the
consultation room.

02:35.741 --> 02:37.304
Lock down the walk-in entrance.

02:37.329 --> 02:38.301
From now on,

02:38.326 --> 02:39.903
all patients funnel through
the ambulance bay.

02:39.928 --> 02:42.535
Maggie, trigger an All
Hazards Disaster Plan.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.194
Every doctor, nurse, and tech
on call gets in here now.

02:45.219 --> 02:46.211
Already on it.

02:46.236 --> 02:47.817
How many victims can we handle?

02:47.842 --> 02:50.000
16 yellow tags, four,
maybe five red tags.

02:50.025 --> 02:51.288
We're gonna have more than that.

02:51.313 --> 02:52.763
You're going to Trauma One.

02:52.788 --> 02:54.608
Deb?

02:55.105 --> 02:56.717
She's pouring blood everywhere.

02:56.742 --> 02:58.317
Prep a chest tray for
an ED thoracotomy.

02:58.342 --> 03:00.521
No, no, no, Mass Casualty protocol.

03:00.546 --> 03:02.585
No chance of recovery,
no resuscitation.

03:02.610 --> 03:04.310
Save the living, Dr. Sexton.

03:04.335 --> 03:06.049
Doris, move her out.

03:06.074 --> 03:08.512
- Dr. Choi, April, Baghdad.
- On it.

03:09.021 --> 03:10.689
Go, go, go.

03:10.839 --> 03:13.074
All right, weak pulse, not breathing.

03:13.099 --> 03:16.050
One, two, three, four
holes, face, neck, chest.

03:16.410 --> 03:18.612
Belly's hard as a rock. He's
bleeding into his abdomen.

03:18.637 --> 03:20.193
Okay, we'll deal with that
after we get him an airway.

03:20.218 --> 03:22.192
- Intubation kit?
- Yes, Doctor.

03:25.173 --> 03:27.145
Half his face is gone. No
chance I get a tube in.

03:27.170 --> 03:28.797
He needs a crich.

03:32.007 --> 03:34.011
Here we go! They're coming in!

03:34.036 --> 03:35.877
Noah, you're going to Treatment One.

03:35.996 --> 03:38.111
Dr. Reese, you're going
to Treatment Two.

03:38.136 --> 03:39.469
There you go, sir.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.225
- Dr. Charles...
- Yeah, Maggie?

03:41.250 --> 03:43.212
You're going to Treatment Three.

03:46.972 --> 03:48.817
Okay, file in down the line.

03:48.842 --> 03:51.517
You're going to Four,
you're going to Five...

03:51.542 --> 03:53.739
There you go... and
you're going to Six.

03:53.764 --> 03:55.346
There you go.

03:55.371 --> 03:57.446
Be careful. Rotate. Rotate here.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:09.194 --> 04:10.681
Fast scan.

04:10.706 --> 04:11.870
I can't get the tube in.

04:11.895 --> 04:13.606
Too much blood in the airway. Suction.

04:15.970 --> 04:17.098
Blood in the pelvis.

04:17.122 --> 04:19.161
Two more units of o-neg
on the rapid transfuser.

04:19.483 --> 04:21.649
Block party today at Millenium Park.

04:21.675 --> 04:22.877
Saturday plus tourists.

04:22.902 --> 04:24.536
Gotta be a few thousand
people down there.

04:24.561 --> 04:25.989
Owen's nanny sometimes
brings him down there

04:26.014 --> 04:27.374
to ride his scooter.

04:27.399 --> 04:29.290
I don't know if they went today.

04:30.087 --> 04:31.848
I'm sure they're fine, Natalie.

04:31.873 --> 04:33.679
Yeah, that's I keep telling myself.

04:37.085 --> 04:39.276
Okay, I'm in. Bag him.

04:41.692 --> 04:43.072
- Maggie?
- Yeah?

04:43.097 --> 04:44.706
I don't know if Owen and his
Nanny went to the park today.

04:44.731 --> 04:45.965
- Can you...
- I have her number.

04:45.990 --> 04:47.590
- I'll call her. Okay.
- Thank you.

04:55.742 --> 04:57.378
Oh, my God.

04:57.403 --> 04:59.104
Where do we begin?

04:59.762 --> 05:01.264
- Maggie?
- Yeah?

05:01.289 --> 05:02.435
We need to prioritize
surgical candidates.

05:02.460 --> 05:04.992
- Where are they?
- Everywhere.

05:05.643 --> 05:07.143
Connor, I need you.

05:07.168 --> 05:08.098
All right, start in
the treatment rooms.

05:08.123 --> 05:10.777
I'll meet you on the other side.

05:11.191 --> 05:13.491
Sinus tach. Pressure dropping.

05:14.699 --> 05:17.034
- Trach tube.
- Trach tube.

05:20.012 --> 05:21.726
All set up.

05:21.903 --> 05:25.189
- He's crashing.
- Asystole. I'm on his chest.

05:25.214 --> 05:26.915
No compressions. We can't save him.

05:26.949 --> 05:28.685
Dr. Choi, I'm losing her pulse.

05:28.710 --> 05:30.261
She's apneic.

05:30.359 --> 05:32.487
Okay, time of death: 14:38.

05:32.512 --> 05:34.526
Him out, her in.

05:35.427 --> 05:38.215
April, Stohl needs you in Triage.

05:38.603 --> 05:40.733
- Come on, come on, let's go.
- Go.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.771
- Doris, can you move him?
- Morgue's full.

05:42.796 --> 05:44.400
Okay, then just find a place up here.

05:44.907 --> 05:46.407
Bag her.

05:48.530 --> 05:51.443
Two IVs? W-What's that mean? Is it bad?

05:51.468 --> 05:53.146
No, no, no, it's just a move now

05:53.171 --> 05:56.118
to save time later if
there is an emergency.

05:56.143 --> 05:58.945
Emergency? But I have a yellow tag.

05:58.970 --> 06:00.686
That means stable, right?

06:00.711 --> 06:02.474
Red's the bad one and black...

06:02.499 --> 06:05.147
No, no, no, it's just
a preemptive measure.

06:05.171 --> 06:06.156
That's all.

06:06.181 --> 06:07.999
The shots, they just kept coming.

06:08.024 --> 06:09.528
I... I ran, but I got knocked out,

06:09.553 --> 06:11.312
and I couldn't get up.

06:11.337 --> 06:13.599
I can't imagine.

06:13.624 --> 06:15.361
I... I'm so sorry.

06:15.765 --> 06:18.249
All around me, people
were just being...

06:18.274 --> 06:20.063
torn apart.

06:20.230 --> 06:22.341
This blood is not mine!

06:22.366 --> 06:25.059
Kay... look at me.

06:25.084 --> 06:26.803
Look at me.

06:26.828 --> 06:29.273
Slow, deep breaths, okay?

06:29.298 --> 06:30.653
Like this. Loo... look...

06:34.442 --> 06:36.572
Dr. Charles...

06:37.106 --> 06:38.871
she's reliving the moment.

06:38.896 --> 06:42.131
No! No! Who are you?

06:42.156 --> 06:44.879
Hey, here, take my hand.
Okay, it's okay.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.735
Look at me, look at me,
look at me, look at me.

06:46.760 --> 06:48.648
Look at my hands. You see
me holding your hands?

06:48.673 --> 06:50.186
You feel me holding your hands?

06:50.210 --> 06:51.513
You're safe. You're in a hospital.

06:51.538 --> 06:52.468
You're here with me.

06:52.493 --> 06:55.031
We're gonna take care of ya, all right?

06:55.056 --> 06:56.956
I'm Dr. Charles. Can
you tell me your name?

06:57.969 --> 06:59.343
Uh, Jill.

06:59.368 --> 07:00.785
Okay, Jill.

07:01.349 --> 07:02.873
We got this, okay?

07:02.898 --> 07:04.387
Okay.

07:04.412 --> 07:06.838
It'll be all right.

07:07.522 --> 07:10.950
<i>Appears to be a mass
shooting in Chicago...</i>

07:12.327 --> 07:14.028
Water?

07:16.630 --> 07:19.135
Uh, would you like a water?

07:21.479 --> 07:23.219
Oh, my God.

07:23.244 --> 07:25.645
Uh, help? Help!

07:25.670 --> 07:28.996
Uh, he... he just looked
at me and slumped.

07:29.021 --> 07:30.321
Okay, he's breathing.

07:30.346 --> 07:31.779
Weak carotid pulse. Nothing radial.

07:31.804 --> 07:32.985
I need a gurney!

07:33.010 --> 07:34.856
Help me elevate his legs.

07:35.904 --> 07:37.794
- Emily?
- Uh...

07:38.089 --> 07:39.692
What happened?

07:39.717 --> 07:42.385
BP dropped too low. He passed out.

07:42.410 --> 07:44.978
Sometimes a fracture can
trigger a sudden dip.

07:45.003 --> 07:48.660
There could be a broken
bone beneath the swelling.

07:50.483 --> 07:52.729
- What's going on?
- You passed out.

07:52.754 --> 07:53.859
Sorry.

07:53.884 --> 07:55.547
I'm gonna get you on some IV fluids

07:55.572 --> 07:57.575
and send you in for an
X-ray of your right arm.

07:58.289 --> 08:00.181
Feels busted.

08:00.206 --> 08:02.473
Good thing I'm a lefty. Sorry.

08:02.498 --> 08:03.903
I shouldn't joke right now.

08:03.928 --> 08:06.590
It's just... this is a lot.

08:06.615 --> 08:09.050
It's okay.

08:09.075 --> 08:11.247
I get it. Don't feel bad.

08:15.229 --> 08:16.701
This is madness.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.922
- Dr. Stohl, we've got incoming.
- Yes.

08:18.947 --> 08:21.715
- How many?
- 25, at least 10 critical.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.650
That's too many. We're already swamped.

08:23.685 --> 08:25.299
They need to be rerouted to East Mercy

08:25.324 --> 08:26.788
- or Lakeshore Memorial.
- They can't.

08:26.813 --> 08:27.600
They're choked up too.

08:27.625 --> 08:29.353
They're trying to send patients to us.

08:29.378 --> 08:31.473
So let's get Maggie
to double up patients

08:31.498 --> 08:34.236
into treatment rooms and trauma bays.

08:34.261 --> 08:37.030
Remove the dividing walls
to make the space.

08:37.065 --> 08:40.246
April, with me, we need to
help unload these ambos.

09:01.896 --> 09:04.200
Two per room? That's not gonna do it.

09:04.225 --> 09:06.236
No, not even close.

09:11.737 --> 09:13.837
Hey, Maggie, where do you want us?

09:13.862 --> 09:15.387
Treatment room, wherever you can fit.

09:15.412 --> 09:17.127
- Copy.
- Maggie?

09:17.152 --> 09:19.652
- Follow Noah and make space.
- Mm-hmm.

09:20.918 --> 09:23.180
No, no, no, no, no, I
gotta stagger the intake.

09:23.205 --> 09:25.340
- Find a trauma bay.
- They're all jammed.

09:25.374 --> 09:27.503
Well, elevator hallway?

09:28.150 --> 09:30.785
- Did you get to Liz?
- No, voicemail.

09:30.810 --> 09:33.194
- Please keep trying.
- Yeah.

09:37.672 --> 09:39.221
Two hemostats and 10 ml of lidocaine.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.122
We're out of lidocaine.
Waiting on resupply.

09:41.147 --> 09:43.496
- 50 mics of fentanyl instead?
- 25.

09:43.521 --> 09:45.448
He's gonna need a neuroexam.
Can't dope him up.

09:45.473 --> 09:46.427
All right, squeeze my hand.

09:46.452 --> 09:48.014
Come on, it's only gonna take a second.

09:48.039 --> 09:50.841
Okay, keep squeezing.

09:50.866 --> 09:52.354
We're almost there.

09:52.379 --> 09:54.871
- Done.
- What do you got?

09:54.896 --> 09:56.083
Lacerated right carotid.

09:56.108 --> 09:57.370
Bleeding's under control for now.

09:57.395 --> 09:58.439
What's his pressure?

09:58.463 --> 10:00.938
- Low but holding. 89 over 50.
- All right, up his volume.

10:00.963 --> 10:02.641
I'll get him in the O.R.
as soon as I can.

10:02.666 --> 10:03.295
He can't wait.

10:03.320 --> 10:04.866
Connor, I clamped off
blood flow to his brain.

10:04.891 --> 10:06.317
- He sits too long...
- He hasn't stroked.

10:06.342 --> 10:08.232
That means he's got adequate
flow on the other side.

10:08.257 --> 10:09.206
He can wait.

10:09.231 --> 10:10.754
Dr. Rhodes, I need you in
Three, Four, Six, and Seven.

10:10.779 --> 10:12.353
Who's first?

10:12.378 --> 10:13.967
Ava and I are running
all over the place.

10:13.992 --> 10:16.533
We get to one patient, three
more pile up somewhere else.

10:16.558 --> 10:17.833
This isn't working.

10:17.858 --> 10:19.983
Oh, heads up, next
wave five minutes out.

10:20.264 --> 10:22.199
Ms. Goodwin, we're
stabilizing patients,

10:22.224 --> 10:23.340
but if we can't get them to surgery,

10:23.365 --> 10:24.310
we'll start losing them.

10:24.335 --> 10:26.142
Unless something changes,
the ED's gonna collapse.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.755
Well, if you have an
idea, now is the time.

10:27.780 --> 10:29.613
Casualty collection areas.

10:29.703 --> 10:31.434
Designated zones for
specific treatments,

10:31.459 --> 10:33.147
especially surgical eval.

10:33.172 --> 10:35.466
Doctors stay put, patients
shuttle between zones.

10:35.491 --> 10:37.481
An assembly line?

10:37.506 --> 10:39.122
All right, you set it up in Triage,

10:39.147 --> 10:41.849
- I'll spread the word.
- Yes, ma'am.

10:43.955 --> 10:45.872
I saw the shooter.

10:47.112 --> 10:50.124
I should've... run at him,

10:50.149 --> 10:52.832
tackled him, done... something,

10:52.857 --> 10:55.874
but instead, I just stood there,

10:55.899 --> 10:59.195
like a coward, while
he mowed people down.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.229
Have you heard of fight-or-flight?

11:01.254 --> 11:03.210
Before that is the freeze.

11:03.235 --> 11:04.997
It's an instinct that kicks in

11:05.022 --> 11:06.790
when there's no time to think.

11:06.815 --> 11:10.866
Not running at that shooter
might've saved your life, okay?

11:16.486 --> 11:18.520
Can you tell me your name?

11:19.810 --> 11:21.795
Sir, do you know where you are?

11:26.274 --> 11:27.897
Wow, you were, uh...

11:30.831 --> 11:32.645
You were right there, huh?

11:34.513 --> 11:36.830
Dr. Charles, uh, Dr. Reese...

11:38.289 --> 11:39.447
Paramedics are bringing in

11:39.472 --> 11:40.715
personal belongings from the scene.

11:40.740 --> 11:42.253
Uh, what should I do with them?

11:42.278 --> 11:43.615
Oh, this is awful.

11:43.640 --> 11:45.920
Uh... uh, people are gonna
wanna go through those,

11:45.945 --> 11:47.841
so, um, we should put it on display.

11:47.866 --> 11:50.508
There's at least
three-dozen boxes already,

11:50.533 --> 11:52.199
and they said there's more coming.

11:52.224 --> 11:55.110
Um... use the cafeteria. Dr.
Reese, can you oversee?

11:55.135 --> 11:56.602
People are gonna be, you
know, overwhelmed and...

11:56.627 --> 11:58.200
Yeah, got it.

12:02.223 --> 12:03.549
Uh... uh, I'm Dr. Charles.

12:03.574 --> 12:06.197
What... what's your name?
Can you tell me your name?

12:06.453 --> 12:07.870
Roger.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.775
Where am I? You're in a hospital.

12:11.225 --> 12:13.592
You were... you were
involved in a shooting.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.547
- I was?
- Yeah.

12:16.133 --> 12:18.056
You know, you have a
wound on your head,

12:18.081 --> 12:20.264
and I'd very much like to
get one of the ER doctors

12:20.289 --> 12:21.871
just to take a look at it.

12:21.896 --> 12:24.018
Would that be all right?

12:24.113 --> 12:26.343
Yeah. Okay.

12:26.368 --> 12:28.002
Okay, good.

12:28.027 --> 12:31.401
All right, CTs and X-rays are
in the elevator hallway.

12:31.426 --> 12:34.833
If the line gets long, just
snake it around the corner.

12:34.858 --> 12:37.489
Monique, One and Two are
now laceration repair

12:37.514 --> 12:39.759
and hemorrhage control. You lead.

12:40.142 --> 12:44.479
Dr. Sexton, Trauma Two is now
strictly for chest tubes.

12:44.504 --> 12:46.595
Once they're in, move them to Baghdad

12:46.620 --> 12:48.105
for surgical eval.

12:48.130 --> 12:49.623
Okay.

12:50.795 --> 12:53.070
- Ms. Goodwin...
- Yes?

12:53.095 --> 12:55.292
- We're abandoning protocol?
- Uh, have to.

12:55.317 --> 12:56.859
Our disaster plan wasn't designed

12:56.884 --> 12:58.968
for an incident this massive.

12:58.993 --> 13:01.453
But a change on the fly?
That makes me nervous.

13:01.478 --> 13:03.260
Noted.

13:04.603 --> 13:07.771
Uh, Dr. Halstead, you now live
in Treatments Six and Seven.

13:07.796 --> 13:09.216
Nothing but intubations.

13:09.241 --> 13:11.498
Any person with respiratory compromise

13:11.523 --> 13:13.026
will be coming straight to you.

13:13.051 --> 13:14.937
Okay, but, uh, meds are a problem.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.677
It's taking forever for
nurses to run back and forth

13:16.702 --> 13:17.935
pulling etomidate and sux.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.743
All right, I'll override
the fingerprint scan

13:19.768 --> 13:21.023
on the medication dispenser.

13:21.048 --> 13:22.279
Leave the door open,

13:22.304 --> 13:24.033
so nurses can stuff their pockets.

13:24.058 --> 13:25.744
We'll have no idea who's getting what.

13:25.769 --> 13:28.368
You mean who's being
charged for what, right?

13:28.393 --> 13:30.628
Let's figure out billing later.

13:32.111 --> 13:33.821
I need help!

13:38.018 --> 13:39.859
Trample victim. No pulse.

13:43.273 --> 13:45.922
No breath sounds either. On his chest.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.020
April, quick look and
an intubation kit.

13:48.045 --> 13:49.647
Then start a line to push meds.

13:49.672 --> 13:52.623
No, triple zero. Pupils
are fixed and dilated.

13:52.648 --> 13:55.089
- He's dead. Where's his family?
- I don't know.

13:55.114 --> 13:56.882
Good Samaritan found him
on the ground not moving,

13:56.907 --> 13:58.702
drove him in in his own car.

13:58.727 --> 14:01.199
Dr. Bekker, Dr. Rhodes is calling you.

14:05.020 --> 14:07.481
If Owen and his Nanny did
go to the park today,

14:07.506 --> 14:09.562
what if they got separated too?

14:09.587 --> 14:11.117
Until you know for sure,

14:11.142 --> 14:13.432
don't let your mind lead
you to a bad place.

14:13.908 --> 14:16.025
Stay focused on right now.

14:16.721 --> 14:19.303
Natalie, need extra hands.

14:19.612 --> 14:21.713
- April?
- I'll move him.

14:28.746 --> 14:30.213
I need a hand in here!

14:30.238 --> 14:31.905
No! No, no, don't touch me!

14:31.930 --> 14:33.593
I'm sorry, honey, but I have to.

14:33.618 --> 14:35.336
I'm a doctor, okay? I
promise you I'll be quick.

14:35.361 --> 14:36.942
It hurts. Where's my mom?

14:36.967 --> 14:38.200
We're gonna do our best
to try to find her,

14:38.225 --> 14:39.923
but right now, I have to help you.

14:39.948 --> 14:41.148
Can I do that?

14:41.173 --> 14:43.258
Thank you.

14:43.488 --> 14:45.805
Bullet wounds to the left hand,

14:45.830 --> 14:47.868
- the left thigh...
- Where is she?

14:47.893 --> 14:49.914
Good pulse in the wrist and feet.

14:49.939 --> 14:51.548
No life-threatening issues.

14:51.573 --> 14:52.874
4 of morphine for the pain,

14:52.899 --> 14:54.765
then bandage her wounds,
send her upstairs.

14:54.790 --> 14:55.986
They can dress her up there.

14:56.011 --> 14:57.360
I'm gonna send you to
another doctor, okay?

14:57.384 --> 14:59.585
- Be brave, sweetheart.
- Okay.

15:00.826 --> 15:02.541
Hole in the left anterior chest wall.

15:02.566 --> 15:04.167
Breath sounds present and bilaterally.

15:04.192 --> 15:05.392
Get him in line for a chest X-ray.

15:05.417 --> 15:06.287
Yep.

15:09.133 --> 15:10.967
Things moving smoother in here?

15:10.992 --> 15:12.166
Yeah, bringing patients here

15:12.191 --> 15:14.447
instead of us trying to find
them, it's a great call.

16:07.799 --> 16:10.722
Uh, heavy confusion, memory loss,

16:10.747 --> 16:12.229
no recollection of what...
what happened today.

16:12.254 --> 16:13.588
He could barely tell me his name.

16:13.613 --> 16:15.291
But, I mean, I guess
it could be neural.

16:15.316 --> 16:16.666
I'm just thinking shock.

16:16.691 --> 16:18.933
Yeah, him and everyone
else, including me.

16:19.395 --> 16:21.649
We'll stitch that up
when we get a chance.

16:22.167 --> 16:24.335
Oh, my God. What...

16:24.611 --> 16:26.285
Roger...

16:27.037 --> 16:29.229
so, listen, I... I know it's
difficult to make sense

16:29.254 --> 16:31.390
of what's going on around you right now

16:31.415 --> 16:32.760
and... and what happened today,

16:32.785 --> 16:35.729
but I can help you put that
puzzle together, okay?

16:35.754 --> 16:36.803
Just keep some pressure
on this right now.

16:36.828 --> 16:38.924
Dr. Charles? Unconscious
when he came in.

16:38.949 --> 16:41.535
GSW nicked the external jugular vein.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.135
As long as he keeps pressure on it,

16:43.160 --> 16:44.360
his vitals are stable,

16:44.385 --> 16:47.467
but... he refuses to do it.

16:48.710 --> 16:50.203
You keep pressure on that.

16:50.228 --> 16:52.161
I'll be right back, okay?

16:56.528 --> 16:59.396
I got it. How we doing?

16:59.525 --> 17:01.333
You don't have to help me.

17:01.358 --> 17:02.713
Yeah, well, I... I mean, I kinda do,

17:02.738 --> 17:04.885
'cause if... if somebody
doesn't hold this,

17:04.910 --> 17:06.743
you're gonna die,

17:07.127 --> 17:09.295
- I'm okay with that.
- Yeah, well, I'm not,

17:09.319 --> 17:11.541
so I guess you're stuck with
me for the moment anyway.

17:12.002 --> 17:13.935
I'm Dr. Charles. What's your name?

17:13.961 --> 17:16.762
Uh... uh, Trevor.

17:20.781 --> 17:22.147
Good pulse and BP,

17:22.173 --> 17:24.224
but diminished breath
sounds on the left.

17:24.250 --> 17:26.098
Chest X-ray.

17:28.601 --> 17:29.967
Hey, man, how are you doing?

17:29.992 --> 17:32.070
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?

17:32.095 --> 17:33.986
All right, log roll.

17:34.011 --> 17:36.104
Kay, okay. One...

17:36.131 --> 17:38.032
Two holes, left delt, right upper back.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.382
Chest tube, then CT chest
and thoracic spine.

17:40.407 --> 17:42.295
Keep him on his side.

17:42.320 --> 17:44.661
You're gonna be fine, man.
You're gonna be fine.

17:44.686 --> 17:45.732
Go.

17:45.757 --> 17:48.031
- More ambos inbound.
- We'll be ready.

17:49.693 --> 17:51.512
Hearing PD hasn't found the shooter.

17:51.537 --> 17:52.870
If he's still out there...

17:52.895 --> 17:54.921
Yeah... this could get worse.

17:56.907 --> 17:59.463
Dr. Choi, we need you in Baghdad.

17:59.488 --> 18:01.505
- April, take over Triage.
- What?

18:01.530 --> 18:03.141
You've seen enough bullet
holes to gauge risk.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.121
- Ethan...
- Dr. Choi!

18:04.146 --> 18:05.892
April, hey, hey, hey, eye the wound,

18:05.919 --> 18:07.550
assess trajectory, predict
potential injuries,

18:07.575 --> 18:09.852
then send them where they need to be.

18:09.975 --> 18:11.576
You got this.

18:17.212 --> 18:19.681
One, two, three.

18:19.706 --> 18:22.331
Heart rate's jumping, BP's crashing.

18:22.356 --> 18:24.716
There's only a trickle of blood
coming from the chest tube.

18:24.741 --> 18:26.268
Guy has two holes.

18:26.293 --> 18:28.305
He was stable. Hemorrhagic shock?

18:28.330 --> 18:30.023
The GSW must've traversed the liver.

18:30.048 --> 18:30.978
Fast scan.

18:31.003 --> 18:33.194
2 units o-neg and 2 of plasma
on the rapid transfuser.

18:33.219 --> 18:35.320
Chest tube must've clotted.

18:35.345 --> 18:37.029
It took a bit, but now
he's coagulopathic.

18:37.054 --> 18:38.962
Yeah, fast scan's positive.

18:38.987 --> 18:40.508
He's bleeding into his chest and belly.

18:40.533 --> 18:42.459
We need to replace the tube. Scissors?

18:42.484 --> 18:43.465
Connor, what's up?

18:43.490 --> 18:45.796
This guy needs surgery, but the O.R.
is packed.

18:45.821 --> 18:47.875
I need to convert
Baghdad and do it here.

18:47.900 --> 18:49.020
Okay, I got more victims en route.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.879
You can have half the space.

18:51.279 --> 18:54.644
No, I'm not opening him up with
people running in and out.

18:54.868 --> 18:56.302
Then take the doctor's lounge.

18:56.327 --> 18:57.913
Four walls and a door, as
quiet as you're gonna get.

18:57.938 --> 18:59.405
Doctor's lounge?

18:59.430 --> 19:02.460
No gas lines, suction lines,
airflow capabilities,

19:02.485 --> 19:04.604
it's short electrical
outlets, lighting?

19:04.629 --> 19:06.362
Come on.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.190
I'll take it.

19:30.174 --> 19:32.108
Excuse us.

19:39.157 --> 19:40.672
I'm sorry I took so long.

19:40.697 --> 19:42.423
The police had the streets blocked off.

19:42.448 --> 19:45.064
Never mind, unimportant.
Where is Dr. Rhodes?

19:45.564 --> 19:48.110
Operating in the doctor's lounge.

19:49.871 --> 19:51.638
Yeah, I know.

19:57.979 --> 19:59.380
Dr. Latham, good, you're here.

19:59.405 --> 20:00.888
We're gonna do a laparotomy.

20:00.913 --> 20:02.512
This is not a surgical suite, Dr.
Rhodes.

20:02.537 --> 20:04.374
Oh, I know, but I'm
afraid it's all we got.

20:04.399 --> 20:05.766
We'll also need an
electrocautery machine

20:05.791 --> 20:07.146
and an ultrasonic cavitation device.

20:07.171 --> 20:08.735
There's no frills today, sorry.

20:08.849 --> 20:11.038
No, no, no! There can't be any shadows.

20:11.063 --> 20:14.118
Dr. Latham, I know this is a
lot of change all at once,

20:14.143 --> 20:15.286
but this patient is
running out of time.

20:15.311 --> 20:17.878
I can't do the surgery alone. I
really need your help, okay?

20:17.903 --> 20:20.071
Yes. Yes, of course.

20:20.222 --> 20:21.990
I'll scrub in. Where?

20:25.942 --> 20:27.905
Yeah.

20:29.170 --> 20:31.004
All right, Connor,
anything else you need?

20:31.029 --> 20:32.862
- Uh-huh, Noah.
- Hm?

20:33.272 --> 20:34.670
For what?

20:34.695 --> 20:36.474
Anesthesia and airway control.

20:39.335 --> 20:41.725
Uh, D... Dr. Rhodes, I... I have,

20:41.750 --> 20:44.346
like, three hours of
surgical experience.

20:44.371 --> 20:46.055
And now you get more.

20:46.359 --> 20:48.226
Bring in the patient.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.535
So, I gotta be honest,
I really feel like

20:54.560 --> 20:56.794
I've been doing a little bit
too much of the talking here.

20:56.819 --> 20:58.004
No way I can get you to tell me

20:58.029 --> 20:59.876
a little bit about what happened today?

20:59.901 --> 21:01.668
I thought I had a jacket.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.170
Did I drop it?

21:04.195 --> 21:05.762
You know what? You could've.

21:06.096 --> 21:08.731
Our memory tends to
come back in fragments,

21:08.756 --> 21:12.328
and so time and space tend
to be a little mixed up.

21:14.058 --> 21:15.440
Um...

21:15.826 --> 21:18.365
hey, Trevor, you think I
can get you to take over

21:18.390 --> 21:20.044
putting pressure on the wound for me?

21:20.630 --> 21:22.331
- My wife...
- Yeah?

21:22.356 --> 21:25.727
I lost my wife this morning.

21:29.983 --> 21:31.417
That's awful.

21:31.442 --> 21:33.697
That's really awful. I'm
sorry to hear that.

21:33.722 --> 21:36.712
She was a good person.

21:39.065 --> 21:40.699
I really don't deserve your help.

21:40.724 --> 21:42.415
You should just, like...

21:42.440 --> 21:44.416
Just let me go.

21:45.012 --> 21:48.238
You know that feeling of...
Of it being unfair,

21:48.669 --> 21:50.813
you know, that your wife
was taken and you weren't?

21:51.242 --> 21:52.814
Maybe even feeling a little bit guilty

21:52.839 --> 21:54.845
that... that you survived?

21:55.835 --> 21:58.213
Well...

21:58.238 --> 21:59.714
that's... it's just normal

21:59.739 --> 22:01.431
for this horrible thing
you've been through,

22:01.456 --> 22:03.279
and if it's any consolation at all,

22:03.304 --> 22:04.996
there's probably a lot of
people in this hospital

22:05.021 --> 22:07.863
who are feeling... the
same way right now.

22:07.942 --> 22:09.602
Well, then you should go be with them,

22:09.627 --> 22:12.376
because... you can't help me.

22:12.401 --> 22:14.722
- You know what, though, I can.
- No, you can't!

22:14.747 --> 22:17.168
I just need you to meet me halfway,

22:17.770 --> 22:19.804
by putting pressure on your wound.

22:19.829 --> 22:21.782
I just need to go over and
talk to this gentleman

22:21.807 --> 22:23.518
for just a minute, and
I'll be right back.

22:26.497 --> 22:28.491
I, uh...

22:28.805 --> 22:31.432
- I collect things...
- Uh-huh?

22:31.457 --> 22:34.510
And my wife, she said
that I was a hoarder,

22:34.535 --> 22:36.491
and that......

22:36.687 --> 22:38.849
She was gonna throw it all out.

22:41.769 --> 22:44.629
God, I would get so mad, but I...

22:44.654 --> 22:46.306
I was wearing a jacket.

22:46.331 --> 22:48.038
I had it at lunch.

22:51.317 --> 22:53.284
God...

22:57.063 --> 22:58.488
I got this.

22:59.931 --> 23:01.984
- You sure?
- Yes.

23:02.665 --> 23:04.266
Thank you.

23:11.677 --> 23:14.359
So the officer saw the guy
ditch the assault rifle,

23:14.384 --> 23:15.741
then he got a shot off,

23:15.766 --> 23:17.330
and then he lost him in the crowd.

23:17.355 --> 23:19.489
And you think now he's here?

23:19.753 --> 23:21.487
Yeah, maybe. He was wearing a hoodie.

23:21.512 --> 23:23.133
We recovered it at the scene.

23:23.253 --> 23:24.812
Tested positive for gunshot residue,

23:24.837 --> 23:25.916
and there was blood on it.

23:25.941 --> 23:27.587
So the officer might've shot him?

23:27.612 --> 23:28.642
Well, that's the theory.

23:28.667 --> 23:30.577
We're thinking either the
paramedics brought him in,

23:30.602 --> 23:32.119
or he's hiding among the injured,

23:32.144 --> 23:33.276
so we're checking all the hospitals

23:33.301 --> 23:35.354
against the officer's
partial description.

23:35.514 --> 23:37.253
White male, brown hair,

23:37.278 --> 23:39.374
medium height, build, dark pants.

23:39.399 --> 23:40.721
Do you mind if my guys
just go through the ED?

23:40.746 --> 23:42.146
- Please.
- All right.

23:42.171 --> 23:44.345
But, uh, we're barely
keeping it together here.

23:44.370 --> 23:46.777
What's happening out there?

23:50.258 --> 23:51.992
People are scared.

23:52.267 --> 23:53.891
The cell network is probably down

23:53.916 --> 23:55.883
from the boost in traffic, right?

23:55.908 --> 23:57.910
Probably why Maggie can't get through?

23:57.935 --> 24:00.063
Yeah, I think you're right.

24:00.415 --> 24:02.104
All right, I'm in. Bag him.

24:02.129 --> 24:03.878
Then CT zone for head and chest.

24:04.227 --> 24:06.434
And then up to the ICU for neuro.
Let's go.

24:13.487 --> 24:16.093
Hey, Jay, uh, my son, Owen,

24:16.118 --> 24:18.060
he and the nanny may have
been at Millenium Park today,

24:18.085 --> 24:19.549
but I can't reach them. Can you...

24:19.574 --> 24:21.516
Every cop in the city's
looking for the shooter.

24:21.541 --> 24:23.463
- I'm so sorry, Nat.
- Okay.

24:27.707 --> 24:30.186
Natalie, if you need to go home...

24:30.211 --> 24:32.335
How can I leave?

24:32.499 --> 24:34.683
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

24:35.297 --> 24:37.546
How do you know which parts
of the bowel are viable?

24:37.571 --> 24:39.354
Peristalsis? Color?

24:39.379 --> 24:40.818
Right now, I don't
care about viability.

24:40.843 --> 24:42.519
I only care about the bleeding.

24:42.544 --> 24:44.912
Ooh, this is wild.

24:44.937 --> 24:46.324
Being a trauma surgeon is intense.

24:46.349 --> 24:49.307
- No time to think. Just react...
- Stop talking.

24:49.660 --> 24:52.502
I haven't been inside an
abdomen since my residency.

24:52.527 --> 24:55.499
It's okay, Dr. Latham.
Surgery is surgery.

24:56.146 --> 24:57.919
GIA stapler for the anastomosis.

24:57.944 --> 24:59.278
Skip it, it takes too long.

24:59.303 --> 25:00.871
But I've already resected
a portion of the bowel.

25:00.896 --> 25:02.065
It needs to be reconstructed.

25:02.090 --> 25:03.806
Just leave it in discontinuity.

25:03.831 --> 25:05.284
That doesn't make any sense.

25:05.309 --> 25:07.190
We'll have to open him back
up again to make the repair.

25:07.215 --> 25:08.837
No, 'cause we're not gonna close him.

25:08.862 --> 25:10.103
But he'll be susceptible to infection.

25:10.128 --> 25:12.429
Dr. Latham, this is damage control.

25:12.454 --> 25:14.260
Stop the bleeding, stop the spillage,

25:14.285 --> 25:16.404
move on to the next patient.

25:17.290 --> 25:18.861
Are you good?

25:18.886 --> 25:20.453
Yes.

25:20.800 --> 25:23.017
- Let's continue.
- Okay.

25:46.588 --> 25:48.972
- This is my brother's.
- It belongs to my son.

25:49.004 --> 25:50.268
I bought it for him.

25:50.293 --> 25:52.142
Lady, if you don't let
go and back off...

25:52.167 --> 25:53.874
Hey, maybe I can help,
maybe I can help.

25:53.899 --> 25:56.455
Look inside. You'll find sheet music.

25:56.480 --> 25:58.178
He plays the bass.

26:00.713 --> 26:02.231
May I?

26:16.522 --> 26:17.728
Told you.

26:20.243 --> 26:22.764
I know my son was at the park today.

26:23.410 --> 26:26.380
If he was okay, he would've called.

26:26.405 --> 26:28.392
He always calls.

26:28.979 --> 26:31.447
His name is Jared. He's 16.

26:36.051 --> 26:38.208
- Oh, I've seen him. He's here.
- Is he all right?

26:38.233 --> 26:39.869
Uh, when I saw him,

26:39.894 --> 26:41.942
he was conscious, talking.

26:41.967 --> 26:43.299
- He had a broken arm.
- Oh, my God.

26:43.324 --> 26:45.413
- I'll find him.
- Thank you. Thank you.

26:49.937 --> 26:51.450
Emily?

26:52.447 --> 26:53.903
What do you need?

26:55.207 --> 26:57.996
Emily? Hey, what do you need?

26:58.021 --> 27:00.255
Uh... uh, there's...
There's a lot of people

27:00.280 --> 27:01.612
bleeding in the waiting room.

27:01.637 --> 27:03.407
The nurse needs help.

27:04.645 --> 27:06.452
But I don't have anyone else.

27:08.144 --> 27:09.878
Wait a second, I got an idea.

27:09.903 --> 27:11.350
Come with me.

27:12.080 --> 27:13.914
Come, come, come, come!

27:17.773 --> 27:19.641
- Caprice?
- Yes?

27:19.666 --> 27:22.285
I know you're busy,
but I need some help.

27:25.207 --> 27:28.071
Sir, ma'am, can I borrow
you for a second?

27:28.176 --> 27:31.502
So, we have a lot of injured,
but not enough nurses,

27:31.527 --> 27:33.654
so we need volunteers.

27:34.194 --> 27:36.295
Caprice here is gonna teach
you how to apply pressure,

27:36.320 --> 27:38.582
hemostatic bandages, and tourniquets.

27:38.732 --> 27:40.366
Are we all still in?

27:40.550 --> 27:42.901
- Em?
- Yeah, okay.

27:42.926 --> 27:44.763
Great. Okay.

27:44.788 --> 27:47.623
That's you. You.

27:47.839 --> 27:49.987
Go be sharks. Find some blood.

27:50.012 --> 27:53.411
- Come with me.
- Okay.

27:53.786 --> 27:55.851
Sir, would you like to help?

27:56.533 --> 27:59.468
- No.
- I will.

27:59.673 --> 28:01.456
Oh, thank you.

28:01.937 --> 28:03.501
There you go.

28:12.012 --> 28:15.307
He's right there: white man,
medium build, dark pants.

28:15.332 --> 28:17.488
Fits the profile. He was
acting kinda sketchy.

28:17.513 --> 28:19.269
He stared right through me.

28:19.294 --> 28:20.670
I see him.

28:27.819 --> 28:29.414
What's going on, Ms. Goodwin?

28:29.439 --> 28:31.534
They think they may have the shooter.

28:36.947 --> 28:39.413
Chicago Police, sir, I
need to talk to you.

28:39.438 --> 28:40.463
I didn't do anything.

28:40.488 --> 28:41.757
Put the bag down and
show me your hands.

28:41.782 --> 28:42.737
I didn't do anything.

28:42.762 --> 28:44.827
Drop the bag and show me your hands!

28:48.526 --> 28:50.094
Get up! Get up!

28:50.119 --> 28:52.320
Do not move.

29:06.283 --> 29:08.050
He's a thief.

29:08.075 --> 29:09.883
He looted the bodies. Opportunist scum.

29:09.908 --> 29:12.009
Detective, I understand
you have a job to do,

29:12.034 --> 29:13.704
but this description of the shooter,

29:13.729 --> 29:16.168
white male, dark pants, it's vague.

29:16.193 --> 29:17.768
Ms. Goodwin, if I think I
found the son of a bitch

29:17.793 --> 29:19.610
that did this, I'm going after him.

29:20.419 --> 29:22.943
ICU for rewarming and resuscitation.

29:23.170 --> 29:24.993
Okay, bring in the next one.

29:25.018 --> 29:26.755
Dr. Latham, I'm sorry if
I overstepped earlier.

29:26.780 --> 29:28.013
I certainly wasn't trying to criticize.

29:28.038 --> 29:29.772
No need for an apology, Dr. Rhodes.

29:29.797 --> 29:31.953
I realize that my rigidness
can be frustrating.

29:31.978 --> 29:35.147
While your tone was unnerving,
your words were enlightening.

29:35.172 --> 29:36.297
They were?

29:36.322 --> 29:37.962
Stop the bleeding, stop the spillage,

29:37.987 --> 29:39.366
move on to the next patient.

29:39.391 --> 29:41.699
Precisely the structure I needed.

29:41.724 --> 29:44.303
Well, then I'm glad I could help.

29:46.078 --> 29:48.121
Okay, let's do this.

29:49.079 --> 29:51.282
He was hit by a car trying
to escape the scene.

29:51.307 --> 29:53.793
Broken ribs, diminished breath
sounds in the left chest.

29:53.818 --> 29:55.453
He needs a tube.

29:55.642 --> 29:57.078
Emily, what are you doing?

29:57.103 --> 29:59.771
Uh, looking for more bandages, gauze.

30:00.020 --> 30:02.324
I'm helping the nurses
in the waiting room.

30:08.771 --> 30:10.791
While he was waiting for his X-ray?

30:11.072 --> 30:12.791
Epidural hematoma.

30:12.816 --> 30:15.557
By the time they got him
to me, he was gone.

30:15.731 --> 30:17.599
There was nothing I could do.

30:17.625 --> 30:19.315
His mother is here.

30:19.340 --> 30:21.073
Thinks he's all right.

30:22.924 --> 30:24.558
Poor woman.

30:31.565 --> 30:33.712
Am I doing this right?

30:34.168 --> 30:35.983
I think so.

30:36.231 --> 30:37.765
You're good at this.

30:38.041 --> 30:40.068
Blood doesn't bother me.

30:46.977 --> 30:48.578
I can see it.

30:49.793 --> 30:51.590
There was a band.

30:52.730 --> 30:56.091
Every song was an '80s cover.

30:56.925 --> 30:59.060
This woman started dancing with me.

30:59.094 --> 31:00.068
Uh-huh.

31:00.093 --> 31:02.828
And were you guys dancing together

31:02.899 --> 31:04.599
when the gunfire broke out?

31:04.624 --> 31:07.225
Uh, Doctor, I...

31:08.228 --> 31:09.642
Yes.

31:10.709 --> 31:12.176
Did you happen to look and see

31:12.201 --> 31:14.508
what direction the
gunfire was coming from?

31:14.920 --> 31:16.587
Uh, yes.

31:16.612 --> 31:18.523
D-Doctor, there are so many people here

31:18.548 --> 31:19.916
who are in worse shape than me.

31:19.941 --> 31:21.077
I really... I should just go.

31:21.102 --> 31:22.510
W... well, you... You
can't go yet, Trevor,

31:22.535 --> 31:23.828
because you still need treatment.

31:23.853 --> 31:25.100
You're bleeding from your neck.

31:25.125 --> 31:27.648
But I just... I need to
be just anywhere else.

31:27.673 --> 31:29.135
I'm... I'm fine.

31:29.160 --> 31:31.700
Okay, okay. Um...

31:32.291 --> 31:33.914
I'll be right back.

31:35.024 --> 31:37.544
Look, what I'm hearing is that
actually you're not fine.

31:37.569 --> 31:39.837
You're trying to convince
yourself you're fine.

31:39.862 --> 31:41.210
- I am.
- Look, I get it,

31:41.235 --> 31:43.090
but I can also see how
much pain you're in,

31:43.115 --> 31:44.847
and you have every right to be.

31:44.872 --> 31:46.621
Uh, listen, I don't expect
you to believe me right now,

31:46.646 --> 31:47.984
but I promise you will get better,

31:48.009 --> 31:49.182
but you... you need to hang in with me

31:49.207 --> 31:52.377
a little bit longer, okay? Okay?

31:54.997 --> 31:56.895
What you looking at, Roger?

31:58.392 --> 32:00.014
Him.

32:00.831 --> 32:02.560
That guy?

32:02.585 --> 32:04.252
You recognize him?

32:06.736 --> 32:08.097
Yes.

32:11.815 --> 32:14.415
I'm in. Bag her, then chest tube zone.

32:14.440 --> 32:15.690
She's getting our last ventilator.

32:15.715 --> 32:18.933
- What? We're out?
- Yes.

32:18.958 --> 32:20.784
We can switch to bags full-time.

32:20.809 --> 32:23.315
Who's gonna work 'em? We
don't have enough nurses.

32:23.340 --> 32:24.941
We'll get extra tubing and split it,

32:24.966 --> 32:26.330
put two patients on a
single ventilator.

32:26.355 --> 32:27.746
No, the vent isn't strong enough.

32:27.771 --> 32:28.946
I'm in. Bag him.

32:28.971 --> 32:30.704
Yeah, if we match patients who
are roughly the same size,

32:30.729 --> 32:33.159
double the tidal volume,
should be enough to hold.

32:33.340 --> 32:35.540
Okay. Okay.

32:35.565 --> 32:38.479
Oh, my God, Owen? Owen?

32:38.918 --> 32:41.172
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

32:44.649 --> 32:46.826
I just need to... I need some...
I need some air.

32:46.851 --> 32:47.887
Just five minutes, okay?

32:47.912 --> 32:49.605
Of course. I'll take care of the vents.

32:52.431 --> 32:54.232
So this guy, Roger,
I've been working with,

32:54.266 --> 32:55.859
his memory is still very hazy.

32:55.884 --> 32:57.993
The one thing he is
absolutely certain about

32:58.018 --> 33:00.701
is that he saw this fellow
over here in the kiddie chair

33:00.726 --> 33:03.169
with the blue shirt right there,

33:03.325 --> 33:06.737
and that he had, quote, "A
look of rage in his eyes."

33:06.762 --> 33:09.644
We've already had one false ID, Daniel,

33:09.669 --> 33:10.760
and witness statements...

33:10.785 --> 33:13.263
Notoriously unreliable, I know.

33:13.288 --> 33:14.120
I'm just saying,

33:14.145 --> 33:15.916
this guy, Roger, very well
could've seen everything.

33:15.941 --> 33:17.884
I mean, that's why I'm spending
so much time with him.

33:17.909 --> 33:20.854
You think it's possible
that he can ID the shooter?

33:20.879 --> 33:23.981
Yeah, it's possible. I mean,
he knows he saw David.

33:24.233 --> 33:26.859
And I gotta tell ya, I've
been watching them for a bit,

33:26.884 --> 33:28.805
and he is a little overly enthusiastic,

33:28.830 --> 33:31.188
in terms of helping all
the other victims.

33:31.213 --> 33:32.569
You know, create a disaster,

33:32.594 --> 33:35.240
so that he can then rise
up and become the hero,

33:35.265 --> 33:36.872
you know, I don't know.

33:36.897 --> 33:39.168
We got a name: Trent Harris, 43.

33:39.193 --> 33:40.392
Well, Dr. Charles was wondering

33:40.417 --> 33:43.395
if it could be this guy
behind you in the blue shirt.

33:43.420 --> 33:46.274
But he's been telling
us his name is David.

33:46.299 --> 33:48.036
Well, he would definitely
give a fake name.

33:48.061 --> 33:51.221
Yes, but he looks like
he's in his twenties,

33:51.246 --> 33:52.209
not his forties.

33:52.234 --> 33:53.868
Yeah, how'd you make your ID?

33:53.893 --> 33:56.246
Registered AR-15 we
recovered at the scene.

33:56.610 --> 33:58.756
You sit tight, tuck in, just watch him.

33:59.019 --> 34:00.340
PD is pulling DMV photos.

34:00.365 --> 34:01.999
If we do get a positive ID,

34:02.024 --> 34:04.178
be ready to clear as many
people out of here as you can.

34:04.234 --> 34:06.111
I'll find Maggie and spread the word.

34:06.136 --> 34:07.270
Okay.

34:07.295 --> 34:08.853
- Thank you, Jay.
- Yeah.

34:09.033 --> 34:11.060
So S.W.A.T raided Harris's house,

34:11.085 --> 34:12.728
crap floor to ceiling, major hoarder.

34:12.753 --> 34:15.842
They found another body.
Guy shot his wife.

34:25.290 --> 34:26.757
Where is he?

34:26.782 --> 34:28.732
- Where'd this guy go?
- I don't know.

34:56.502 --> 34:58.824
Little help? I need help!

35:02.616 --> 35:05.195
Trevor, hey. Trevor!

35:09.506 --> 35:11.295
Ethan, April, I need you.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.155
Thready pulse, hole in the neck.!

35:13.189 --> 35:15.589
Slashed his wrist. Multiple
stab wounds to the abdomen.

35:24.880 --> 35:26.358
Guy's lost a lot of blood.

35:26.383 --> 35:27.765
Let's give him two units of O-Neg

35:27.790 --> 35:29.889
- and start bagging.
- I need to intubate.

35:29.914 --> 35:32.046
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

35:34.608 --> 35:37.068
Detective Halstead said
he'll have a photo

35:37.093 --> 35:39.716
of our suspect, Trent Harris,

35:39.741 --> 35:41.483
an... any second now.

35:41.909 --> 35:43.902
He's not the guy.

35:46.936 --> 35:48.962
Sats, 82. Heart rate, 130.

35:48.987 --> 35:50.884
Interior abdomen stab wounds.

35:50.909 --> 35:52.897
Belly's distended. Fast scan.

35:52.922 --> 35:54.537
Razor slash to the bone.

35:56.255 --> 35:57.656
I'm in.

35:57.735 --> 36:00.310
Fast scan's positive.

36:00.912 --> 36:02.953
- Where are we?
- Belly's full of blood.

36:02.978 --> 36:04.446
He needs surgery now.

36:04.471 --> 36:06.274
We'll take him to the doctor's lounge.
Let's go.

36:08.332 --> 36:10.667
Connor, that's our guy.

36:10.692 --> 36:13.041
Don't let him off the hook by dying.

36:13.802 --> 36:15.901
When did you realize
he was the shooter?

36:15.935 --> 36:17.547
When I heard about his wife...

36:17.703 --> 36:19.399
and the hoarding.

36:19.424 --> 36:20.836
You knew?

36:21.099 --> 36:23.504
We're struggling to keep
innocent victims alive,

36:23.529 --> 36:26.344
and you pull us away
to save this monster?

36:27.019 --> 36:30.084
Damn it, Dr. Charles,
my son is missing!

36:41.818 --> 36:43.251
I'm so sorry.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.857
Jared's gone?

36:49.826 --> 36:51.058
That's it?

36:53.424 --> 36:55.841
I'm so sorry.

36:55.866 --> 36:57.686
No.

37:24.244 --> 37:25.878
He'll live.

37:32.812 --> 37:34.243
Tired?

37:34.991 --> 37:37.032
I am exhausted.

37:37.559 --> 37:39.198
Yeah, me too.

37:40.107 --> 37:42.645
They still need help
upstairs in the O.Rs.

37:43.654 --> 37:46.210
Let's go.

37:56.879 --> 37:58.520
Natalie?

37:58.949 --> 38:02.056
It looks like Liz's
phone, Owen's nanny.

38:22.385 --> 38:23.683
Owen?

38:24.784 --> 38:26.293
Mommy!

38:26.318 --> 38:27.457
There she is.

38:34.455 --> 38:35.919
How?

38:36.878 --> 38:39.765
Once they found the shooter,
I had Jay make some calls.

38:39.790 --> 38:42.072
Owen and Liz, they were at the park.

38:42.175 --> 38:43.943
They ran as soon as
they heard the gunfire

38:43.968 --> 38:46.517
and left everything behind and
got to the 51st District.

39:01.405 --> 39:04.020
Great work today, Dr. Choi.

39:04.045 --> 39:05.745
Thanks.

39:09.450 --> 39:11.358
So much blood.

39:12.137 --> 39:14.499
I can still smell the iron in the air.

39:18.847 --> 39:21.048
You okay?

39:23.639 --> 39:25.378
Still shaking.

39:30.865 --> 39:32.926
Crazy thing is, it's the
most gratifying day

39:32.951 --> 39:34.996
I've ever had as a doctor...

39:39.116 --> 39:41.232
But I don't know what to feel.

39:55.166 --> 39:56.792
Emily stepped up.

39:56.817 --> 39:58.254
Yeah.

39:58.906 --> 40:00.654
Yeah, she did.

40:10.515 --> 40:13.217
Since the first victim rolled
in, it's only been two hours.

40:13.251 --> 40:15.875
Feels like two weeks.

40:16.232 --> 40:17.931
This is the world we live in, huh?

40:17.956 --> 40:21.063
Yeah... unfortunately.

40:23.412 --> 40:25.845
Hey, phenomenal job, Sharon, okay?

40:25.870 --> 40:29.026
Approval for a new CT
scanner, done deal.

40:29.051 --> 40:30.353
You know something, Peter,

40:30.378 --> 40:33.850
just a CT scanner is not gonna cut it.

40:34.706 --> 40:38.409
The numbers we saw today,
we need multiple scanners,

40:38.443 --> 40:40.825
triple the number of trauma bays.

40:40.850 --> 40:43.646
Waiting room and hallway walls wired

40:43.671 --> 40:45.553
for monitors and oxygen,

40:45.578 --> 40:46.963
and that's just the beginning.

40:46.988 --> 40:50.332
So basically, you're talking about a...
a whole new ED?

40:50.592 --> 40:53.324
Yeah, I guess I am.

40:55.353 --> 40:57.468
Okay.

41:03.336 --> 41:04.651
Daniel?

41:09.840 --> 41:11.881
Of course you had to save him.

41:12.165 --> 41:13.678
I know that,

41:13.703 --> 41:15.372
and she does too.
