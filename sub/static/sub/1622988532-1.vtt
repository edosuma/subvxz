01:00.728 --> 01:02.530
Stop!

01:02.564 --> 01:04.197
Stop.

01:06.668 --> 01:08.368
Stop, I'll do it.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.538
Please, I'll obey.

01:14.809 --> 01:17.377
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
just give me another chance.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.614
I'll do what you ask. Please.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.217
I'm sorry!

01:25.653 --> 01:28.455
Sorry, I'll do better, please!

02:59.614 --> 03:02.215
Get... let me go,
get off of me!

03:02.249 --> 03:03.885
No!

03:03.918 --> 03:05.318
Get in.

03:39.754 --> 03:43.658
Sofia, you look completely
lovely this afternoon.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.292
Absolutely perfect.

03:46.426 --> 03:48.295
Now purse your lips.

03:48.328 --> 03:50.531
That's it, just purse your lips.

03:56.871 --> 03:59.607
Now, do you want
to please your man?

03:59.640 --> 04:01.743
Yes?

04:01.776 --> 04:04.377
Do anything he wants you to do.

04:04.411 --> 04:08.281
You'll suck his cock daily.

04:08.315 --> 04:09.817
Anything.

04:11.753 --> 04:13.420
Good.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.087
No, no!

04:47.789 --> 04:48.990
Don't fight back.

04:49.023 --> 04:51.424
Don't fight back, Lorian.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.528
How do you know my name?

04:56.396 --> 04:57.632
You have women here?

04:59.534 --> 05:01.536
There's a cost
for everything beautiful.

05:02.603 --> 05:03.871
Do you understand?

05:05.673 --> 05:06.941
No.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.377
No.

05:11.546 --> 05:14.816
No, no, don't, don't.

05:17.752 --> 05:19.520
There you go.

05:19.554 --> 05:21.022
Good.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.529
Now be still.

05:39.707 --> 05:40.942
Look at that.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.880
The best America has to offer.

05:48.583 --> 05:51.118
Blonde and blue eyes.

05:51.152 --> 05:53.988
The FÃ¼hrer would be so proud.

05:56.489 --> 05:57.992
We had to make up

05:58.025 --> 06:02.063
for our Heinrich's indulgence.

06:02.096 --> 06:03.931
We couldn't help it though.

06:04.966 --> 06:07.635
It's always your fault.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.637
Do you understand?

06:11.739 --> 06:12.840
Wait.

06:13.908 --> 06:15.142
Wait.

06:21.182 --> 06:22.817
You're such a disappointment,
Misha.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.151
You're quite stupid, aren't you?

06:24.185 --> 06:27.121
I got her, like you wanted,
and she's beautiful!

06:27.154 --> 06:29.123
Even more than the others.

06:29.156 --> 06:32.126
Beauty is a gift
you do not possess.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.795
You could have.

06:34.829 --> 06:37.164
It's too late now.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.851
And if you keep sampling
the merchandise,

06:56.884 --> 06:58.119
you'll diminish it.

06:58.152 --> 06:59.220
I didn't touch her.

06:59.253 --> 07:02.757
women
that weren't like you.

07:08.229 --> 07:11.065
Look at you with your ugly hair
and your clown makeup.

07:12.767 --> 07:14.735
You call yourself a woman?

07:17.705 --> 07:21.943
And yet you make the girls up
very nicely,

07:21.976 --> 07:24.845
but you do nothing with yourself
just to piss me off.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.522
Why did you marry me then?

07:36.190 --> 07:38.592
Just get our next Sofia ready.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.534
It's no longer the same.

08:22.269 --> 08:25.239
And they can't possibly
understand what that means.

08:27.008 --> 08:28.642
But they will.

09:19.894 --> 09:21.629
Hello?

09:25.166 --> 09:26.834
Can you hear me?

11:48.375 --> 11:49.743
Fuck!

11:54.848 --> 11:59.019
Well, aren't you the picture
of beauty today, Lorian West?

11:59.053 --> 12:02.022
Hmm?

12:02.056 --> 12:03.490
Except that's
an unfortunate injury.

12:03.525 --> 12:04.792
Let me have a look.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.532
It's probably just
a light sprain.

12:14.969 --> 12:16.370
Please let me go.

12:19.574 --> 12:22.042
This place is full of dangers.

12:22.076 --> 12:25.446
A person could easily hurt
themselves falling

12:25.479 --> 12:28.349
on a rusty rake or pushing
too hard against a balcony.

12:28.382 --> 12:30.851
This is just
a temporary place for us,

12:30.884 --> 12:34.088
a waystation... of sorts.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.890
For you, perhaps a crossroads.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.425
Are you going to kill me?

12:39.493 --> 12:41.395
Of course not.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.164
A slight sprain.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.433
You won't be able to run away,
but you'll be fine.

12:46.467 --> 12:49.136
I think you know
my wife Misha already.

12:58.045 --> 13:00.314
Let's get some ice on it.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.016
You're, uh...

13:04.351 --> 13:06.053
You're different.

13:17.431 --> 13:18.899
We will punish you.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.202
You don't seem to understand.

13:26.574 --> 13:30.177
You traffic women.

13:32.046 --> 13:34.048
We create beauty,

13:34.081 --> 13:37.951
and we follow
a very high standard,

13:37.985 --> 13:42.089
including the selection process.

13:42.122 --> 13:45.893
Only when the change is complete
do we deliver.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.428
A change?

13:50.964 --> 13:53.033
Being curious won't help you.

13:54.068 --> 13:55.402
Being obedient will.

14:52.359 --> 14:53.661
Who are you?

14:56.330 --> 14:58.198
Mm, no one.

14:59.366 --> 15:00.434
No, no, no.

15:00.467 --> 15:01.669
Wait.

15:02.737 --> 15:04.238
Wait!

15:49.349 --> 15:53.120
I'll survive it
and attain what you have!

15:53.153 --> 15:56.056
You have no idea.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.191
Aqua Velva.

16:20.615 --> 16:23.150
You have eaten from the tree.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.219
Now you will be as we.

16:25.252 --> 16:27.321
My success is inevitable.

18:14.662 --> 18:16.531
Oh my God!

18:28.843 --> 18:31.211
You know, it's up to Heinrich

18:31.244 --> 18:35.917
about letting you live
and selling you to a client.

18:35.950 --> 18:39.687
At least you're not like
the others.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.357
I have to go back.

18:47.695 --> 18:49.296
Look up Revelation 18.

18:51.566 --> 18:55.637
I'm not... I'm not really
a Bible person.

18:59.941 --> 19:02.910
Can you get me
the keys to the car?

19:08.348 --> 19:11.385
I'm not really
of my own free will,

19:11.418 --> 19:15.288
or else I would...

19:15.322 --> 19:17.525
I would kill them both.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.930
Who controls you?

19:25.700 --> 19:27.735
Look, he's gonna...
he's gonna come in here

19:27.769 --> 19:28.970
and try to change you.

19:29.003 --> 19:31.572
You just gotta go along,
you play the game.

19:31.606 --> 19:35.409
You aren't who
you think you are.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.845
I know that's hard
to understand.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.381
You're the opposition.

19:44.351 --> 19:47.922
I see things.

19:47.955 --> 19:50.457
I see you getting out of here,

19:50.490 --> 19:53.761
and that is
a one-time opportunity.

19:55.697 --> 19:57.865
Well, well, well.

19:57.899 --> 19:59.934
Isn't this nice?

20:01.468 --> 20:02.804
You!

20:02.837 --> 20:04.839
Out now!

20:04.872 --> 20:06.841
Now!

20:06.874 --> 20:09.544
You, look at me.

20:09.577 --> 20:11.946
Look at me.

20:11.979 --> 20:13.848
You stay put,

20:13.881 --> 20:15.750
or next time it's your foot.

20:15.783 --> 20:17.618
Do you understand?

20:21.022 --> 20:22.023
Out!

20:22.056 --> 20:23.891
Get the fuck out!

20:49.050 --> 20:51.586
You just hate beautiful women.

20:51.619 --> 20:55.355
You are to stay out of sight
and not mess with her.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.758
That's 300K in there,

20:56.791 --> 20:59.560
now maybe docked to 275
because of that toe.

21:00.728 --> 21:03.363
Which you, Misha, cut off.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.770
You did, by breaking the rules.

21:09.804 --> 21:11.639
The rules?

21:13.574 --> 21:15.408
We have rules now?

21:15.442 --> 21:17.745
You know what you should do?
You should write them out

21:17.779 --> 21:20.447
and then post them
on the internet.

21:21.883 --> 21:25.052
You cold, miserable bitch!

21:25.086 --> 21:28.355
I am a happily married woman.

21:30.558 --> 21:36.063
Then, uh, why does Daddy
like fucking me

21:36.097 --> 21:39.000
more than he likes fucking you?

21:40.433 --> 21:42.036
You're lying.

21:43.070 --> 21:46.574
You want me to comfort you?

21:48.475 --> 21:50.745
It's all in your head.

21:52.412 --> 21:55.482
They track you.

21:55.516 --> 21:58.853
You're becoming them.

21:58.886 --> 22:00.855
Legion.

22:11.699 --> 22:15.136
Why did you cut off my toe?

22:15.169 --> 22:16.604
Ow!

22:16.637 --> 22:18.139
Stop.

22:20.074 --> 22:25.546
Honey, you need to do
exactly what you're told

22:25.580 --> 22:28.983
if you want to live.

22:29.016 --> 22:30.651
There's two ways this goes:

22:30.685 --> 22:33.888
one, you're in a private jet
looking all pretty,

22:33.921 --> 22:37.490
or two, you're pig food,

22:37.525 --> 22:40.161
or three, there's always three.

22:40.194 --> 22:43.564
So you should do everything
you can to protect me.

22:43.598 --> 22:46.100
I can't promise anything
anymore.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.506
Heinrich is quite something.

22:55.076 --> 22:58.079
Dark, bad boy,

22:58.112 --> 23:00.047
with that sort of...

23:00.081 --> 23:02.917
cosmopolitan trashy charm.

23:05.152 --> 23:07.121
Sophisticated.

23:10.024 --> 23:12.159
That just reels you in.

23:15.229 --> 23:17.965
You can't resist, you know?

23:20.735 --> 23:22.169
The dark power.

23:26.007 --> 23:27.174
Ah-ah-ah.

23:29.043 --> 23:32.813
Don't harm the merchandise.

23:37.585 --> 23:40.054
You're not like the others.

23:42.489 --> 23:45.793
But let me tell you something.

23:45.826 --> 23:49.496
You won't even remember
your own face

23:49.530 --> 23:51.232
when this is all over.

24:24.699 --> 24:26.600
Costin' me money.

24:28.169 --> 24:30.504
Look, I don't know
and I don't care

24:30.538 --> 24:32.907
what kinda spooky shit
you got goin' on out here,

24:32.940 --> 24:34.976
but we need product,
you understand?

24:35.009 --> 24:37.712
Well, this is not
an exact science.

24:37.745 --> 24:39.513
There's a spiritual dimension
as well.

24:39.547 --> 24:42.883
Sometimes they...
they just don't make it.

24:42.917 --> 24:47.021
Hmm, well, we're very happy
with the work so far, so...

24:47.054 --> 24:48.823
here's a gift.

24:50.591 --> 24:52.059
The Holy Grail.

24:55.796 --> 24:58.032
Which we lovingly call
Aqua Velva,

24:58.065 --> 24:59.934
one of the greatest
quantum breakthroughs

24:59.967 --> 25:01.969
of the last 200 years.

25:06.974 --> 25:10.011
Nobody makes dolls
like you, Heinrich.

25:10.044 --> 25:11.645
I know.

25:11.679 --> 25:14.215
- That shit cracks you up.
- I know.

25:16.150 --> 25:17.618
I'm gonna go upstairs,

25:17.651 --> 25:20.988
dip the old wick, as they say.

25:27.061 --> 25:29.864
You just don't understand
what I really am.

26:17.745 --> 26:18.846
Ow.

26:18.879 --> 26:20.381
Sorry.

26:20.414 --> 26:24.752
I told him not to,
but he don't much listen to me.

26:24.785 --> 26:26.220
Help me please.

26:29.323 --> 26:32.159
You are very...

26:32.193 --> 26:34.061
very nice.

26:34.095 --> 26:35.262
Let me go, okay?

26:35.296 --> 26:37.164
I'll cooperate, just...

26:39.400 --> 26:42.369
- My boyfriend, he's...
- Yeah, your boyfriend.

26:42.403 --> 26:44.004
Jeff Blake?

26:45.973 --> 26:48.109
- Can you call him?
- Sure.

26:49.176 --> 26:51.879
You know he's the one
who set you up, right?

26:53.881 --> 26:56.217
Oh, yeah, I mean, without him,

26:56.250 --> 26:58.252
we wouldn't even know about you.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.288
I can't believe that.

27:01.322 --> 27:04.058
Mm-hmm.

27:04.091 --> 27:06.060
Come on, look at you.

27:06.093 --> 27:07.995
Why do you think
he was with you?

27:09.897 --> 27:11.932
It sure must hurt, huh?

27:15.069 --> 27:18.672
Detective Hennigan's
on the case.

27:18.706 --> 27:20.841
And your parents?

27:20.875 --> 27:22.710
They just hired my buddy,
Shawn James,

27:22.743 --> 27:24.311
best damn P.I. in the state,

27:24.345 --> 27:27.047
when good old Jeff,
your trusty boyfriend

27:27.081 --> 27:29.917
reported you missin'.

27:29.950 --> 27:32.286
Oh...

27:32.319 --> 27:34.822
they all report to me.

27:34.855 --> 27:37.158
Well, see,

27:37.191 --> 27:39.260
I ain't just a sheriff.

28:07.021 --> 28:10.324
It's girls like you
they want these days, Lori.

28:10.357 --> 28:13.994
All-American beauty and brains.

28:14.028 --> 28:17.264
Industry's really changin'.

28:17.298 --> 28:20.234
So you won't mind me.

28:20.267 --> 28:25.139
They'll be fucking you...

28:25.172 --> 28:26.508
over...

28:29.076 --> 28:32.379
...and over and over.

28:36.383 --> 28:40.187
And you'll like it eventually.

28:40.221 --> 28:42.223
I just hope you don't get
some psycho

28:42.256 --> 28:44.258
who's into chainsaws and shit.

28:55.069 --> 28:57.004
Oh, man.

28:57.037 --> 28:59.406
No blue pill necessary.

29:09.350 --> 29:11.118
That toe.

29:11.151 --> 29:14.788
Oh, it was a mistake.

29:14.822 --> 29:17.791
- It might cost us.
- That's all you care about?

29:19.360 --> 29:21.862
I ain't gonna hurt you...

29:21.895 --> 29:23.264
much.

29:25.165 --> 29:26.834
Get off!

29:32.973 --> 29:34.942
Goddamn bitch!

29:40.247 --> 29:42.049
Fuck!

29:53.294 --> 29:55.597
Time for you to become
a lovely woman.

29:57.632 --> 30:01.168
You pull some shit like you did
with Maddox earlier,

30:01.201 --> 30:03.871
and I'm gonna gut you
like a pig.

30:47.948 --> 30:51.151
Open your eyes, Sofia.

30:51.185 --> 30:53.320
Open your eyes.

30:53.354 --> 30:55.389
Now, you were given
a mind-expanding substance

30:55.422 --> 30:57.925
along with something else
to subdue you for long enough

30:57.958 --> 30:59.527
for this to take hold.

30:59.561 --> 31:01.261
You might call it
a date-rape drug.

31:01.295 --> 31:03.063
Now, what color
am I holding up?

31:05.399 --> 31:06.367
Blue.

31:06.400 --> 31:10.104
Blue, very good, perfect.

31:10.137 --> 31:11.905
Now you'll become my doll.

32:58.178 --> 33:00.414
Show me the way,

33:33.380 --> 33:35.182
You're a doll.

33:35.215 --> 33:36.518
Hmm?

33:36.551 --> 33:38.085
Play with yourself.

33:46.460 --> 33:48.428
I know.

33:50.832 --> 33:52.399
I know, I know.

33:59.239 --> 34:02.677
You are Sofia.

34:02.710 --> 34:05.445
I want you,

34:05.479 --> 34:08.348
Heinrich.

34:08.382 --> 34:11.118
But you must be prescient
as well.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.654
We can work on that.

34:12.687 --> 34:13.688
Heinrich?

34:13.721 --> 34:16.824
Lorian, you're beginning
to anticipate my needs.

34:20.460 --> 34:22.530
Who do I rule over?

34:24.799 --> 34:26.701
Are you chosen?

35:27.595 --> 35:31.365
Maybe this time
you'll do what we ask,

35:31.398 --> 35:34.401
but if you do not comply,

35:34.434 --> 35:36.436
you know.

36:42.970 --> 36:45.439
I know that look.

36:48.943 --> 36:52.479
You are the power.

36:58.519 --> 37:00.454
Rule over me.

37:28.583 --> 37:31.418
Well!

37:31.451 --> 37:34.822
- Oh, yeah!
- The latest Sofia.

37:34.856 --> 37:36.557
Mmm.

37:38.860 --> 37:41.829
Heinrich,
you're a goddamn genius.

37:41.863 --> 37:43.831
Yes, well,
the price has gone up.

37:43.865 --> 37:47.802
Unfortunately, the cost
of materials is skyrocketing.

37:48.870 --> 37:50.705
You're short this month.

37:50.738 --> 37:51.939
Yes, I know, I can explain...

37:51.973 --> 37:54.709
The AV is screwing
with your brain,

37:54.742 --> 37:55.910
your judgment.

37:55.943 --> 37:57.578
We needed two this month.

37:57.612 --> 37:59.680
Now one's feral,
another one's dead.

37:59.714 --> 38:02.482
- Yes, I can explain that.
- Don't even try.

38:04.484 --> 38:05.820
How did you know...

38:07.522 --> 38:08.723
...that one is dead?

38:08.756 --> 38:12.059
And they thought the Aqua Velva
was gonna enhance your work.

38:13.528 --> 38:15.495
Don't worry,
you'll meet your quota.

38:15.530 --> 38:20.601
You know that I spent
my whole life in the program.

38:20.635 --> 38:25.039
The reason I left is because
there's no creativity anymore.

38:25.072 --> 38:28.475
It's just meddling.

38:28.509 --> 38:31.546
These dumb-fuck bureaucrats
run the world now.

38:31.579 --> 38:33.548
Well,

38:33.581 --> 38:36.416
that's why you're here
and they're not.

38:36.449 --> 38:38.953
Take your time.

38:38.986 --> 38:40.788
Thank you,
because I was beginning to think

38:40.822 --> 38:43.024
that you were all about
quantity over quality.

38:44.926 --> 38:48.830
The client's extremely pleased,
so fuck you, Heinrich, you win.

38:48.863 --> 38:50.665
More money!

38:53.100 --> 38:54.936
Simpleton.

38:57.638 --> 39:00.107
It's not too late.

39:00.141 --> 39:03.511
Don't stay there.

39:03.544 --> 39:05.746
You need me?

39:05.780 --> 39:08.583
You're still here.

39:08.616 --> 39:12.419
Tell me about, uh, your life.

39:12.452 --> 39:14.155
You have a boyfriend?

39:16.456 --> 39:20.094
Where do you work?

39:20.127 --> 39:22.797
What makes you happy?

39:24.699 --> 39:26.901
Your hands are warm.

39:36.043 --> 39:38.613
We can help each other.

39:41.616 --> 39:43.985
I was, uh...

39:45.786 --> 39:48.589
I wanted to be successful.

39:51.025 --> 39:55.529
My parents were racists.

39:55.563 --> 39:57.965
I don't think that now.

40:00.034 --> 40:02.870
When I was a little girl,

40:02.904 --> 40:04.639
I had a pet hamster.

40:06.040 --> 40:09.176
My brother killed it.

40:09.210 --> 40:10.912
Her.

40:12.046 --> 40:13.681
Sadie.

40:16.651 --> 40:19.186
I had no idea what that meant.

40:22.089 --> 40:26.794
Heinrich is under their control.

40:27.962 --> 40:31.232
I think he loves me.

40:31.265 --> 40:35.036
We can help each other.

40:35.069 --> 40:36.938
You're my friend.

40:38.005 --> 40:40.207
I'm not really anything.

42:19.673 --> 42:21.742
Anything?

42:21.776 --> 42:24.111
All right, last one.

42:44.065 --> 42:46.100
Don't go where
they want you to go.

42:46.133 --> 42:47.902
Look at me.

42:47.935 --> 42:49.236
Look at me!

42:51.972 --> 42:55.242
My life, my joke life,

42:55.276 --> 42:59.346
isn't... wasn't... real anyway.

42:59.380 --> 43:02.183
None of it ever has been.

43:02.216 --> 43:04.685
It's really your joke.

43:06.720 --> 43:09.156
I'm your sick joke.

43:09.190 --> 43:11.859
I'm not going back.

43:11.892 --> 43:14.028
I can't be programmed.

43:14.061 --> 43:17.832
Even if I get out of here,
I am not going back.

43:20.167 --> 43:23.137
Everything is fake.

43:23.170 --> 43:26.774
A box within a box within a box.

43:31.846 --> 43:33.214
A game.

43:35.182 --> 43:38.119
It's so much easier
than real life.

43:42.423 --> 43:44.125
In a way.

44:36.844 --> 44:39.813
So, we're talking to our guest,
Lorian West,

44:39.847 --> 44:42.049
about her time
as a travel editor

44:42.082 --> 44:44.251
at the Denver Post.

44:44.285 --> 44:45.719
Not me.

44:47.087 --> 44:48.088
Going to work.

44:51.158 --> 44:54.028
Having a boyfriend.

44:54.061 --> 44:57.164
Going to a political rally.

44:57.198 --> 44:58.399
Going to a party.

45:00.968 --> 45:03.270
Cruise.

45:03.304 --> 45:06.508
A vacation.

45:06.541 --> 45:09.843
Selling them all.

45:09.877 --> 45:12.446
Plotting your way
into the winner's circle.

45:12.479 --> 45:14.516
So?

45:17.384 --> 45:19.954
So, bend or break.

45:21.922 --> 45:24.191
Okay, so what do you mean?

45:28.095 --> 45:30.497
Perfect.

45:30.532 --> 45:33.400
Break this.

46:04.231 --> 46:06.568
They program you to accept,

46:06.601 --> 46:11.573
but they have no idea that they
are a program of a program.

46:11.606 --> 46:15.075
They programmed me
before they took me.

46:15.109 --> 46:17.278
I'm a program clone.

47:07.027 --> 47:09.129
I'm not going back.

47:17.605 --> 47:20.240
This is the key.

47:20.274 --> 47:22.577
Pure DMT and a mix
of other hallucinogens

47:22.610 --> 47:25.580
beyond what a human
can possibly process.

47:28.215 --> 47:30.552
Now we'll complete
the treatment.

47:32.986 --> 47:34.888
Do you know that I developed
this technique

47:34.922 --> 47:36.558
over 20 years ago?

47:39.059 --> 47:40.461
It's extraordinary.

47:46.033 --> 47:47.669
Legion.

47:49.571 --> 47:51.372
Legion.

48:02.249 --> 48:04.251
The time will come.

48:22.136 --> 48:24.037
Well done.

48:24.071 --> 48:25.573
You think so?

48:27.509 --> 48:30.545
Yes, I think we're ready
for the grand finale.

48:30.578 --> 48:32.680
What if she fails?

48:34.649 --> 48:36.618
Why this sudden concern?

48:36.651 --> 48:39.019
I don't want to die.

48:46.193 --> 48:48.295
But you do.

48:55.302 --> 48:56.270
Now!

49:01.475 --> 49:03.076
Here, Misha.

49:03.110 --> 49:05.312
You can't practice enough.

49:14.087 --> 49:15.222
Go!

49:22.429 --> 49:24.398
There, you wanna try?

49:33.440 --> 49:34.441
Now!

49:40.380 --> 49:43.050
Don't worry, don't think,
just anticipate.

49:43.083 --> 49:44.552
Okay?

49:44.586 --> 49:46.754
Try again.

49:46.788 --> 49:47.789
Go!

50:00.568 --> 50:03.571
Now, Sofia...

50:05.807 --> 50:08.175
Put the barrel in your mouth.

50:13.748 --> 50:16.618
Sofia, place the barrel
in your mouth.

50:17.652 --> 50:19.486
I told you.

50:33.300 --> 50:34.836
Now pull the trigger.

50:46.446 --> 50:47.782
Did you put the word out, Misha?

50:47.815 --> 50:49.017
I did.

50:49.049 --> 50:52.286
One must sacrifice the innocent
to save the.

50:58.225 --> 50:59.627
Beautiful.

51:01.395 --> 51:03.463
Sometimes, we must kill
what we love.

51:24.819 --> 51:26.153
That's it.

51:42.670 --> 51:44.204
You know, there's more
to the vetting process

51:44.237 --> 51:45.372
than we let on.

51:48.275 --> 51:49.811
But you thought
I just sold all my dolls

51:49.844 --> 51:51.546
to some foreign customers.

51:55.215 --> 51:56.316
I'm dizzy.

52:02.624 --> 52:03.858
I'm very selective

52:03.891 --> 52:05.860
and very successful.

52:05.893 --> 52:09.831
I almost don't want
to let you go.

52:09.864 --> 52:11.398
I think you should
come with us to Switzerland.

52:11.431 --> 52:12.800
It's beautiful
this time of year

52:12.834 --> 52:14.702
and I think it would be
wonderful for you.

52:24.746 --> 52:25.913
Priceless.

52:30.785 --> 52:34.221
You're so special.

52:34.254 --> 52:35.790
It doesn't work on you,
does it?

52:38.291 --> 52:40.762
Fucking bitch!

52:40.795 --> 52:43.564
You ruined everything.

52:43.598 --> 52:45.600
You fucking ruined everything!

53:39.486 --> 53:42.657
You like it, don't you?

53:42.690 --> 53:43.825
Huh?

53:46.359 --> 53:49.463
Does it make you happy, huh?

53:57.538 --> 53:59.807
Shit.

53:59.841 --> 54:02.610
Yeah?

54:02.643 --> 54:05.680
Yeah, yeah,
I'm almost there, man, goddamn.

54:05.713 --> 54:08.315
I'll be there soon.

54:08.348 --> 54:09.717
Yeah.

54:09.751 --> 54:10.985
See y'all there.

54:28.335 --> 54:29.302
Woo!

54:35.943 --> 54:37.011
Woo!

54:49.023 --> 54:50.792
Beer?

54:50.825 --> 54:52.727
Hell yeah!

54:52.760 --> 54:55.428
All right, woo!

55:09.744 --> 55:11.813
I want some pussy!

55:16.083 --> 55:17.618
Yeah?

55:17.652 --> 55:19.587
Oh, shit!

55:19.620 --> 55:20.855
How you doing there, Billy?

55:23.791 --> 55:25.492
You ready now?

55:25.526 --> 55:26.994
Ooh, I never been so ready.

55:27.028 --> 55:28.596
Let's go.

55:37.839 --> 55:39.574
I guess I'll leave you two
alone now.

56:29.056 --> 56:30.658
Here I come, baby.

56:35.763 --> 56:37.665
Oh, you're so beautiful...

56:39.600 --> 56:42.469
W-What the fuck?

56:42.502 --> 56:43.738
It's quite all right,
just relax.

56:43.771 --> 56:46.741
Who the fuck are you?

56:46.774 --> 56:48.709
Ah, ladies.

56:48.743 --> 56:50.711
Now, Sofia.

56:50.745 --> 56:53.681
Let's see what you think
of this situation.

56:53.714 --> 56:59.553
This... man
is about to fuck a corpse.

56:59.587 --> 57:00.688
A dead body.

57:00.721 --> 57:02.924
Is that sick or what?

57:10.598 --> 57:11.766
Hm?

57:14.501 --> 57:16.070
Unfortunately,

57:16.103 --> 57:18.072
for organ harvesting,

57:18.105 --> 57:19.707
this one is out.

57:21.075 --> 57:23.511
Is this acceptable to you,
Sofia?

57:23.544 --> 57:27.848
That this pig-man
would fuck a dead body?

57:32.153 --> 57:34.622
Shoot this piece of shit twice.

57:34.655 --> 57:36.057
In the face.

57:36.090 --> 57:38.025
Hey, I paid by credit card.

57:38.059 --> 57:39.727
Yes, we're very grateful.

57:39.760 --> 57:42.029
You think you can just shoot me
and get away with it?

57:42.063 --> 57:43.631
Clients, they know where I am!

57:47.768 --> 57:49.236
Dumb shits!

57:49.270 --> 57:50.938
You'll pay.

58:00.548 --> 58:03.017
Somehow, I don't think so.

58:04.952 --> 58:07.054
Hey, you!

58:07.088 --> 58:09.023
Shit-for-brains!

58:15.196 --> 58:18.232
Do you need help?

58:18.265 --> 58:19.567
Hm?

58:27.174 --> 58:28.776
You should be playing.

58:41.222 --> 58:44.658
Daddy.

58:44.692 --> 58:47.762
I've been bad.

58:49.797 --> 58:51.165
What?

59:29.303 --> 59:32.006
Well, welcome.

59:32.039 --> 59:33.774
How lovely you look
this evening.

59:39.246 --> 59:42.016
- Thank you for inviting me.
- My pleasure.

59:48.789 --> 59:51.692
Well, drink?

59:51.725 --> 59:53.861
To you, dear one.

59:53.894 --> 59:57.331
You've certainly
shown me something.

59:57.364 --> 59:59.333
You're indeed superior
in a manner of speaking,

59:59.366 --> 01:00:01.402
and I have an announcement
to make.

01:00:04.371 --> 01:00:06.907
You, Lorian,
are not a true Sofia.

01:00:06.941 --> 01:00:09.977
No, don't be disappointed.

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:11.312
There's far more to do.

01:00:22.323 --> 01:00:24.091
To a prosperous future.

01:00:35.769 --> 01:00:38.005
Things are looking up.

01:00:42.443 --> 01:00:45.412
You're very handsome tonight.

01:00:45.446 --> 01:00:46.780
Thank you.

01:01:09.103 --> 01:01:10.137
What is this?

01:01:13.941 --> 01:01:16.210
Say hello to Lorian.

01:01:16.243 --> 01:01:17.244
Please.

01:01:17.278 --> 01:01:20.447
Wow.

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:35.763
Oh! I'll have some of that.

01:01:35.796 --> 01:01:37.097
Mmm.

01:01:45.439 --> 01:01:47.074
Yucky.

01:01:51.546 --> 01:01:53.747
You just think
you're so smart,

01:01:53.781 --> 01:01:55.349
making the live sex toys

01:01:55.382 --> 01:01:58.219
for the erectile
dysfunction set.

01:01:58.252 --> 01:02:00.120
You're a throwback
to an antiquated science,

01:02:00.154 --> 01:02:03.525
a dumb, brute force
used during World War II.

01:02:03.558 --> 01:02:06.260
Trauma creates more trauma.

01:02:06.293 --> 01:02:08.495
It's not just manipulation
of personality

01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:09.631
and mental cognition,

01:02:09.664 --> 01:02:12.399
behavioral modification
and predictive programming.

01:02:15.202 --> 01:02:20.174
Splitting off opens for
the other side to infiltrate,

01:02:20.207 --> 01:02:23.477
and fail,
as they always do!

01:02:23.511 --> 01:02:25.946
Dissociation
and reprogramming.

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:28.516
The future grid is
nanodigitization

01:02:28.550 --> 01:02:31.485
of the freaking universe!

01:02:31.519 --> 01:02:35.055
Time and space.

01:02:35.089 --> 01:02:37.858
Mass consciousness
as the weapon of choice,

01:02:37.891 --> 01:02:40.995
game theory
at the molecular point,

01:02:41.028 --> 01:02:46.800
at the biodigital...
nexus point.

01:02:46.834 --> 01:02:49.537
You guys get it?

01:02:49.571 --> 01:02:52.574
It's called...
it's called technology!

01:02:54.141 --> 01:02:56.877
It's macro now, not micro,
uh-uh.

01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:59.380
That's where the real money is,
you know?

01:02:59.413 --> 01:03:02.916
Like, money?
Money, money?

01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:04.552
What? Did you think
they were gonna pay you

01:03:04.586 --> 01:03:06.420
for a new Sofia?

01:03:11.925 --> 01:03:12.926
That's funny.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.564
You're just their little...
their little pet.

01:03:16.598 --> 01:03:17.898
Like a little kitty-kat.

01:03:21.001 --> 01:03:22.870
We are leaving now.

01:03:22.903 --> 01:03:24.305
Lorian,
you're coming with me.

01:03:24.338 --> 01:03:26.574
Gimme the fucking
smart keys, and yes,

01:03:26.608 --> 01:03:27.776
I do know what I mean,

01:03:27.808 --> 01:03:31.979
so stuff that forlorn look
up your tiny ass, sweetie pie.

01:03:35.382 --> 01:03:39.219
Your generation just
doesn't understand quality.

01:03:39.253 --> 01:03:41.523
Or making things the right way,
the real way.

01:03:41.556 --> 01:03:44.925
Step by step, by hand.

01:03:44.958 --> 01:03:46.860
Keys! Now.

01:03:52.499 --> 01:03:54.335
Smart keys.

01:03:56.337 --> 01:03:57.404
You bitch!

01:03:57.438 --> 01:03:59.373
Fuck!

01:03:59.406 --> 01:04:00.974
- Fuck.
- What?

01:04:01.008 --> 01:04:02.476
You don't know anything
all of a sudden?

01:04:07.381 --> 01:04:08.449
Uggh!

01:04:10.484 --> 01:04:11.318
Smart key.

01:04:11.352 --> 01:04:12.920
You have no fucking idea
how much damage

01:04:12.953 --> 01:04:14.488
- you have caused.
- I'm sure that you have

01:04:14.522 --> 01:04:16.990
added it all up
and calculated to the penny,

01:04:17.024 --> 01:04:19.026
right?

01:04:19.059 --> 01:04:20.227
Thank you!

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:21.395
Let's go.

01:04:38.412 --> 01:04:39.913
Motherfucker!

01:05:04.271 --> 01:05:06.140
Whiny.

01:05:06.173 --> 01:05:07.675
We could have sold her.

01:05:07.709 --> 01:05:10.411
But no, no, no, no, no,
you had to interfere.

01:05:10.444 --> 01:05:13.947
Interfere with his brilliance,
with his process.

01:05:13.981 --> 01:05:15.717
You hurt us.

01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:17.284
Us?

01:05:19.486 --> 01:05:24.391
Us? There is no us for you!

01:05:30.765 --> 01:05:32.700
All right, don't hurt her
too much, Misha.

01:05:32.734 --> 01:05:34.201
Stop, Misha!

01:05:34.234 --> 01:05:36.638
Why do you always have
to protect Charlotte?

01:05:36.671 --> 01:05:37.539
It's about time you realized

01:05:37.572 --> 01:05:39.973
that your precious Lorian
is a failure

01:05:40.007 --> 01:05:41.408
and now we have to find her.

01:05:41.442 --> 01:05:44.445
I'm sure Maddox
has her already.

01:05:44.478 --> 01:05:45.979
Happy now?

01:06:25.653 --> 01:06:27.354
Hey, baby!

01:06:27.387 --> 01:06:30.758
How you doin' this evening?

01:06:30.792 --> 01:06:34.228
Hey. You okay, honey?

01:06:34.261 --> 01:06:35.730
Hey!

01:06:35.763 --> 01:06:37.097
You okay?

01:06:40.267 --> 01:06:41.736
Obviously, she's not okay.

01:06:41.769 --> 01:06:44.238
Hey, Candy?

01:06:44.271 --> 01:06:45.673
Shit.

01:07:11.164 --> 01:07:12.499
Everything and everyone
is alive

01:07:12.534 --> 01:07:14.769
and they want me
to help them.

01:07:22.577 --> 01:07:25.680
We need another 300K
for this next phase.

01:07:25.713 --> 01:07:27.314
And transportation.

01:07:27.347 --> 01:07:28.482
Next week, they say.

01:07:28.516 --> 01:07:30.083
We don't have
until next week!

01:07:30.117 --> 01:07:31.686
Fucker!

01:07:31.719 --> 01:07:33.453
Fucking stop it!

01:07:35.322 --> 01:07:36.524
We'll be in business
before this evening,

01:07:36.558 --> 01:07:38.593
just up your game.

01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:45.533
Why don't you love me?

01:07:47.602 --> 01:07:48.670
I picked you up
when you were in

01:07:48.703 --> 01:07:50.337
a ridiculous punk band
going nowhere.

01:07:52.239 --> 01:07:54.107
I just wish
Charlotte was dead.

01:07:56.578 --> 01:08:00.815
Don't you ever say that again.

01:08:00.848 --> 01:08:02.750
She's supportive of you?

01:08:02.784 --> 01:08:04.418
Your loyal one?

01:08:04.451 --> 01:08:05.887
Without us,
she would die.

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:09.891
Charlotte also
designed this program.

01:08:09.924 --> 01:08:12.192
Now, somehow,
she's deviated, regressed,

01:08:12.225 --> 01:08:13.595
but she was top in her class
at MIT

01:08:13.628 --> 01:08:14.696
in theoretical physics

01:08:14.729 --> 01:08:16.564
before I got her a real job.

01:08:16.598 --> 01:08:19.232
Now, her theories
never really panned out,

01:08:19.265 --> 01:08:20.334
she doesn't have
any bragging rights,

01:08:20.367 --> 01:08:23.871
but do not fuck with her.

01:08:23.904 --> 01:08:25.339
She's very vindictive.

01:08:25.372 --> 01:08:29.142
Yeah. No, she's a masochist
and a murderer.

01:08:29.176 --> 01:08:30.511
She produces nothing.

01:08:30.545 --> 01:08:32.479
She helps nothing.

01:08:32.513 --> 01:08:33.747
And she will eventually
kill us.

01:08:33.781 --> 01:08:34.749
And if you can't see that,

01:08:34.782 --> 01:08:36.884
then you're not
a good judge of character.

01:08:38.819 --> 01:08:40.386
There are worse things.

01:09:19.259 --> 01:09:22.596
Better than that big lion
upstairs, hey?

01:09:27.001 --> 01:09:31.973
What happened to us, huh?

01:09:32.006 --> 01:09:35.207
with us?

01:09:35.242 --> 01:09:36.544
We were gonna
travel the world

01:09:36.577 --> 01:09:39.446
and live a good life.

01:09:41.015 --> 01:09:45.720
You just witnessed a tiny
measure of what I can do.

01:09:45.752 --> 01:09:46.921
Did you see that?

01:09:49.991 --> 01:09:52.426
Did you see that?

01:09:54.862 --> 01:09:56.698
Simple question, bubblehead.

01:10:01.803 --> 01:10:04.872
Now, I told you.

01:10:04.906 --> 01:10:08.442
I don't like highlights, right?

01:10:08.475 --> 01:10:10.377
You knew this.

01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:11.612
You failed to fix it.

01:10:11.646 --> 01:10:12.947
I want Lorian fully bleached.

01:10:15.415 --> 01:10:16.450
You know what our client wants,

01:10:16.483 --> 01:10:19.020
so why are you trying
to destroy this operation?

01:10:19.053 --> 01:10:23.591
That shit is killing you.

01:10:23.624 --> 01:10:25.560
This is the future, you idiot!

01:10:27.562 --> 01:10:29.997
I'm the way forward, me,
they chose me!

01:10:30.031 --> 01:10:34.001
Always up front,
not you want-to-bes, hm?

01:10:36.436 --> 01:10:40.007
We have a dream team here.

01:10:40.041 --> 01:10:41.943
Charlotte will soon
see the light,

01:10:41.976 --> 01:10:43.044
and we'll make
so much money,

01:10:43.077 --> 01:10:45.546
it'll blow your
tiny fucking mind.

01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:47.715
Here.
Have your subhuman shit!

01:10:47.749 --> 01:10:51.284
Knock yourself out!

01:10:51.318 --> 01:10:53.888
And some of us
are true pioneers.

01:10:57.091 --> 01:11:00.460
And fix Lorian's foot.

01:11:00.494 --> 01:11:02.897
I'm sick of your feeble attempts
at control.

01:11:16.511 --> 01:11:19.446
He doesn't see in you
what I see.

01:11:25.853 --> 01:11:28.488
Sit with me?

01:11:33.594 --> 01:11:36.798
Ah, shit!

01:11:36.831 --> 01:11:38.833
I thought you were
completely changed.

01:11:38.866 --> 01:11:41.536
I don't know
who the fuck you are anymore.

01:11:41.569 --> 01:11:43.971
I should just
fucking kill you.

01:11:47.642 --> 01:11:50.578
Lorian?

01:11:50.611 --> 01:11:53.548
Sofia?

01:11:53.581 --> 01:11:55.716
What the...

01:12:00.521 --> 01:12:02.557
Who the fuck
talking to?

01:12:09.429 --> 01:12:12.133
They just decided to kill you.

01:12:12.166 --> 01:12:13.801
Why are you helping me?

01:12:13.835 --> 01:12:15.468
I am cooperating
with the enemy

01:12:15.502 --> 01:12:17.638
because sometimes
you have to,

01:12:17.672 --> 01:12:19.472
to survive.

01:12:19.507 --> 01:12:21.509
You'll understand one day.

01:12:21.542 --> 01:12:22.510
Don't worry, Lorian.

01:12:22.543 --> 01:12:24.712
I'll finish the work.

01:12:28.481 --> 01:12:32.687
I am a lion.

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.890
You are whatever
we want you to be.

01:13:30.578 --> 01:13:33.080
TouchÃ©, bitch.

01:13:47.662 --> 01:13:49.664
We are everywhere.

01:13:49.697 --> 01:13:52.199
There is no escape.

01:13:56.604 --> 01:13:59.640
Never listen to the dead.

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.888
Even if I get out
of this place,

01:15:20.921 --> 01:15:23.624
I'm not going back.

01:15:23.657 --> 01:15:26.694
They made me then, too.

01:15:26.727 --> 01:15:30.698
They cloned me
from a clone of a clone.

01:15:32.333 --> 01:15:33.868
Shh!

01:15:36.337 --> 01:15:39.807
The world is a simulation.

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:43.010
There is no other explanation.

01:15:43.044 --> 01:15:45.679
I was chosen,

01:15:45.713 --> 01:15:48.582
but I am not one of them.

01:15:48.616 --> 01:15:50.918
I know.

01:15:50.951 --> 01:15:52.586
I know everything now.

01:16:30.291 --> 01:16:33.327
Congratulations.

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:35.930
You're my finest creation.

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:41.735
Now she will do anything
and everything we ask

01:16:41.769 --> 01:16:44.371
in a far superior manner
to the average Sofia.

01:16:47.141 --> 01:16:49.143
Because she's free.

01:17:25.779 --> 01:17:28.449
I'm no longer subject to
the whims of.

01:17:41.795 --> 01:17:46.033
I've gained no credit
for what I've achieved!

01:17:46.066 --> 01:17:47.801
This little monument

01:17:47.835 --> 01:17:50.037
is for the infantile.

01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:53.073
The challenged,
the mentally impaired!

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:43.757
They can't stop
what has been set in motion.

01:18:43.791 --> 01:18:45.527
Motion is a change of position
between objects

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:49.463
within a given
interval of time.

01:18:49.496 --> 01:18:53.934
But without time, T,

01:18:53.968 --> 01:18:55.936
motion is unnecessary.

01:18:58.872 --> 01:19:01.041
I'm everywhere

01:19:01.075 --> 01:19:03.911
by simultaneously
,

01:19:03.944 --> 01:19:06.080
you miserable bastard.

01:19:17.958 --> 01:19:19.093
I don't know where he is.

01:19:19.126 --> 01:19:20.094
Just listen.

01:19:20.127 --> 01:19:21.829
They're pulling the operation.

01:19:21.862 --> 01:19:22.963
Don't ask me why.

01:19:22.997 --> 01:19:24.198
Oh, fuck!

01:19:24.231 --> 01:19:25.899
You have to kill Lorian.

01:19:25.933 --> 01:19:28.135
I'll deal with Heinrich.

01:19:28.168 --> 01:19:29.937
Those motherfuckers.

01:19:29.970 --> 01:19:30.971
They used him.

01:19:31.005 --> 01:19:32.172
They used us.

01:19:32.206 --> 01:19:34.908
Some kind of half-assed
experiment.

01:19:34.942 --> 01:19:36.243
Of course.

01:19:36.277 --> 01:19:39.980
They drew the data
from the Sofias,

01:19:40.014 --> 01:19:41.215
and then mapped
the progression

01:19:41.248 --> 01:19:43.183
and probably planted Lorian
as a marker.

01:19:43.217 --> 01:19:44.018
And then, of course,

01:19:44.051 --> 01:19:45.886
all the data from
the Aqua Velva,

01:19:45.919 --> 01:19:49.023
which is the real reason
for this whole thing.

01:19:49.056 --> 01:19:50.592
Fuck. I hate those bastards.

01:19:50.625 --> 01:19:52.026
Well, we're pulling out.

01:19:52.059 --> 01:19:53.193
You kill Lorian,

01:19:53.227 --> 01:19:54.828
I'll get back to you.

01:20:18.018 --> 01:20:20.054
You have to let her go.

01:20:22.189 --> 01:20:23.857
You know that
it's a balance,

01:20:23.891 --> 01:20:26.994
and sometimes,
you have to give one back

01:20:27.027 --> 01:20:29.430
in order to survive.

01:20:29.463 --> 01:20:31.398
She is the key.

01:20:31.432 --> 01:20:33.167
No.

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:36.470
You just chose
the wrong girl.

01:20:36.503 --> 01:20:38.573
They've known ever since
they dropped her off.

01:20:38.606 --> 01:20:42.443
We have been under
their microscope ever since.

01:20:42.476 --> 01:20:44.612
Lies!

01:20:44.646 --> 01:20:46.246
They want me to succeed.

01:20:59.561 --> 01:21:01.629
This can be
a total success.

01:21:01.663 --> 01:21:04.064
She's already broken through.

01:21:04.098 --> 01:21:06.634
It's over.

01:21:06.668 --> 01:21:08.135
Let her go.

01:21:38.633 --> 01:21:41.168
There's something
you need to understand.

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:49.376
If you think
I'm inferior to you

01:21:49.410 --> 01:21:50.944
because of that...

01:21:58.318 --> 01:22:00.087
Love me.

01:22:05.159 --> 01:22:06.628
I see.

01:22:09.029 --> 01:22:10.565
Is it okay?

01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:37.191
Gonna fuck you up, bitch!

01:22:44.431 --> 01:22:47.301
Lorian will destroy you.

01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:08.590
Lorian!

01:23:08.623 --> 01:23:12.727
This is your quantum moment.

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:15.329
Charlotte doesn't believe
that I can transmute reality,

01:23:15.362 --> 01:23:17.699
but I just did!

01:23:23.638 --> 01:23:27.374
And you can feel it.

01:23:27.407 --> 01:23:28.710
Pulling you.

01:24:09.851 --> 01:24:12.119
Do you understand now?

01:24:12.152 --> 01:24:13.521
There are two worlds.

01:24:33.206 --> 01:24:35.543
I'm sure Maddox
has her already.

01:25:03.236 --> 01:25:05.907
There you are,
you little bitch.

01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:07.875
Gonna get some!

01:26:46.741 --> 01:26:49.342
Goddamn!

01:26:49.376 --> 01:26:50.912
Bitch!

01:28:55.502 --> 01:28:57.004
You need a doctor.

01:28:59.874 --> 01:29:02.109
Maddox hasn't called yet.

01:29:02.143 --> 01:29:03.845
I can't reach him.

01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:14.387
What's wrong with
having a little fun?

01:29:14.421 --> 01:29:17.091
You need to go
to the hospital.

01:29:17.124 --> 01:29:18.993
Just stitch me up,
s'il vous plaÃ®t.

01:29:44.185 --> 01:29:45.586
Does it hurt?

01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:48.189
I feel nothing.

01:29:48.222 --> 01:29:50.625
I just want to fuck.

01:29:50.658 --> 01:29:52.593
Actually,
I just want to think.

01:29:55.062 --> 01:29:56.797
I just want to breathe,

01:29:56.831 --> 01:29:58.065
I just want to be.

01:30:00.801 --> 01:30:02.837
But there is a proviso.

01:30:06.007 --> 01:30:08.743
Not in a line,

01:30:08.776 --> 01:30:09.610
not in a series.

01:30:09.644 --> 01:30:12.513
I'm so tired
of a series of things.

01:30:15.482 --> 01:30:17.151
Do you realize
that's all your fault, Misha?

01:30:17.184 --> 01:30:18.819
You always think in a series
about everything,

01:30:18.853 --> 01:30:20.487
and you forced
everyone else around you

01:30:20.521 --> 01:30:22.723
to think in the same way.

01:30:22.757 --> 01:30:24.992
Yeah, well,
somebody needs to figure out

01:30:25.026 --> 01:30:28.963
the next fucking step,
and it's obviously not you.

01:30:28.996 --> 01:30:31.599
- Well, there you go again.
- You need me.

01:30:42.276 --> 01:30:43.945
I need...

01:30:47.281 --> 01:30:48.816
...a sign.

01:30:51.719 --> 01:30:54.121
It's Maddox.

01:30:57.158 --> 01:31:01.095
Shit!

01:31:01.128 --> 01:31:02.530
Let's go.

01:32:01.789 --> 01:32:05.159
You think you can take me?

01:32:05.192 --> 01:32:07.328
So far, you've done nothing!

01:32:07.361 --> 01:32:10.064
You silly lion!

01:32:11.766 --> 01:32:15.803
There's a whole world
you know nothing about!

01:33:34.014 --> 01:33:36.016
I am the future.

01:33:38.319 --> 01:33:40.087
It's just the beginning.

01:33:45.759 --> 01:33:50.197
I am so sorry, dear brother.

01:33:57.705 --> 01:33:59.206
Oh.

01:34:09.049 --> 01:34:10.885
He was really your brother?

01:34:14.488 --> 01:34:18.692
I thought that was a game.

01:34:37.044 --> 01:34:38.946
I can't breathe.

01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:41.482
You broke him,

01:34:41.516 --> 01:34:43.150
and I knew you would.

01:34:43.184 --> 01:34:44.718
That is why
I wanted you to leave.

01:34:44.752 --> 01:34:47.955
My brother was a master
of this world.

01:34:50.525 --> 01:34:52.193
You coulda fooled me.

01:34:52.226 --> 01:34:54.828
You are not one of us,

01:34:54.862 --> 01:34:57.331
so I tried to give you back,

01:34:57.364 --> 01:35:00.401
as a gesture of goodwill

01:35:00.434 --> 01:35:02.903
to allow us to continue
unabated.

01:35:06.006 --> 01:35:11.245
So you're the real mastermind
behind this wonderful

01:35:11.278 --> 01:35:13.447
humanitarian service.

01:35:16.283 --> 01:35:19.753
You fooled everyone.

01:35:19.787 --> 01:35:24.124
Even your pathetic brother
and his abuse-victim wife.

01:35:24.158 --> 01:35:26.360
I wanted you to kill Misha.

01:35:26.393 --> 01:35:29.830
She was never good for him,
bad blood.

01:35:29.863 --> 01:35:32.066
But you couldn't even do that.

01:35:32.099 --> 01:35:35.537
So you had your chances.

01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:39.240
It was all in plain sight,
Lorian.

01:35:39.273 --> 01:35:41.809
You just couldn't see it.

01:35:43.444 --> 01:35:45.179
They're all dead now.

01:35:48.983 --> 01:35:50.351
As are you.

01:35:55.289 --> 01:35:56.890
Now.

01:35:56.924 --> 01:36:01.996
We have to go very slowly here,
Lorian.

01:36:16.511 --> 01:36:17.478
That's good.

01:36:17.512 --> 01:36:19.213
My. Who taught you that? Me!

01:36:19.246 --> 01:36:20.948
You're just not
good enough though.

01:36:44.071 --> 01:36:45.039
Bitch!

01:37:35.557 --> 01:37:39.293
You should have read
your own book.

01:37:42.429 --> 01:37:44.264
I know it by heart.

01:40:55.355 --> 01:40:57.625
On target.

01:41:00.895 --> 01:41:02.730
Hi.

01:41:02.764 --> 01:41:03.831
Lorian West here,

01:41:03.865 --> 01:41:05.733
of Lionheart
Self Defense School.

01:41:05.767 --> 01:41:07.835
Women are prey
for traffickers today

01:41:07.869 --> 01:41:10.437
and need to know
how to defend themselves.

01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:11.706
The truth is,

01:41:11.739 --> 01:41:14.408
the kidnapping
and the sex trafficking

01:41:14.441 --> 01:41:17.477
of young to middle-aged women
is a real danger,

01:41:17.512 --> 01:41:20.548
even in upscale malls
and supermarket parking lots.

01:41:20.582 --> 01:41:23.585
I teach you
how to defeat any attacker.

01:41:23.618 --> 01:41:24.786
You know what I mean.

01:41:24.819 --> 01:41:26.320
Get some help.

01:41:26.353 --> 01:41:28.455
Call me before it's too late.

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:37.599
Even if I get out of this place,
I'm not going back.

01:41:37.632 --> 01:41:40.702
They made me then too.

01:41:40.735 --> 01:41:44.404
They cloned me
from a clone of a clone

01:41:44.438 --> 01:41:46.574
of a clone of a clone.

01:41:46.608 --> 01:41:48.141
The world is a simulation.

01:41:49.877 --> 01:41:53.180
There is no other explanation.

01:41:53.213 --> 01:41:55.516
I was chosen.

01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:58.553
But I am not one of them.

01:41:58.586 --> 01:41:59.754
I know.

01:41:59.787 --> 01:42:01.221
I know everything now.

01:42:01.254 --> 01:42:02.489
I know everything now...

01:42:02.523 --> 01:42:03.891
I know everything now.

01:42:31.719 --> 01:42:33.955
You have eaten from the tree.

01:42:33.988 --> 01:42:35.957
Now you will be as we.
