WEBVTT

00:05.000 --> 00:09.680
Not too night and tidy. Pile them up.
I want Treasure Island in here.

00:09.684 --> 00:13.244
Aladdin's Cave. Very good. Very
good.

00:13.273 --> 00:15.273
Great work, Henri. You're a genius.

00:15.313 --> 00:18.633
Well done, ladies. We are making
history here.

00:18.928 --> 00:21.288
Mr Selfridge, if these figures...
Not now, Crabb.

00:21.328 --> 00:24.088
We have a store to open. All well in
accessories, Miss Mardle?

00:24.128 --> 00:26.568
We are missing half the ribbon
consignment.

00:26.608 --> 00:30.048
Improvise. I know I can rely on you
and your excellent assistants.

00:30.088 --> 00:32.247
- Can't we, ladies?
- Yes, Mr Selfridge.

00:32.287 --> 00:35.088
That is the spirit.
I'm proud of you all.

00:35.128 --> 00:37.648
Well, get on with your work.

00:37.688 --> 00:40.648
Miss Bunting, all going to plan here
in the fashion department?

00:40.688 --> 00:43.928
Yes, Mr Selfridge. We are going to
dazzle the world.

00:43.968 --> 00:46.768
Yes, Mr Selfridge.

00:46.808 --> 00:49.088
What do you think, Grove? Your honest
opinion.

00:49.128 --> 00:52.448
Honesty, Chief? Do you really think
London is ready for all this?

00:52.488 --> 00:54.688
Ready for it? London is crying out
for it.

00:54.728 --> 00:57.928
We're giving them style, glamour,
razzmatazz.

00:57.968 --> 00:59.968
Once they see what we have done
here,

01:00.008 --> 01:02.008
there'll be no turning back.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:44.168 --> 01:47.368
Hmmm. I don't know.

01:47.408 --> 01:50.368
Those are the very finest kids, sir.
I'm sure they are.

01:50.408 --> 01:53.608
I'd like to see some more.
What would you like to see, sir?

01:55.288 --> 01:57.368
Well maybe I don't know until I see
it.

01:58.488 --> 02:00.928
Why don't we get a whole lot of 'em
on the counter

02:00.968 --> 02:03.288
and then we can see what we like.

02:03.328 --> 02:05.808
That's not how it's done here, sir.
Come on.

02:06.808 --> 02:09.088
Let's have a little bit of fun.

02:09.127 --> 02:11.648
No, please, sir.
You'll get me into trouble.

02:11.688 --> 02:14.088
You only live once.

02:14.128 --> 02:15.688
All right.

02:18.488 --> 02:19.848
That is more like it.

02:19.888 --> 02:22.528
Which pair would you choose out of
the whole lot?

02:22.568 --> 02:24.568
These. Why is that?

02:24.608 --> 02:28.088
I love the colour and the softness
of the leather.

02:28.128 --> 02:31.008
It's finest Nappa from Florence.

02:31.048 --> 02:32.568
Try 'em on.

02:32.608 --> 02:35.048
Go on. Don't be scared.

02:40.168 --> 02:44.008
What a great choice. What's your
name?

02:44.048 --> 02:46.408
Agnus Towler, sir.
Agnus Towler.

02:46.448 --> 02:48.648
Might I be of any assistance, sir?

02:48.688 --> 02:51.408
Oh, no, thank you. This young lady is
doing just fine.

02:51.448 --> 02:55.368
May I enquire if sir actually
intends making a purchase?

02:55.408 --> 02:59.408
What if I said I was just looking?
This is a shop not an exhibition!

02:59.448 --> 03:01.448
I've had my eye on you for a while.

03:01.488 --> 03:03.408
I suggest that you hop it.

03:07.048 --> 03:10.808
Thank you for your time,
Miss Towler. It's been a pleasure.

03:12.608 --> 03:14.928
Ah. Miss Towler.

03:14.968 --> 03:17.848
You can collect your cards. You're
dismissed.

03:17.888 --> 03:21.968
But I didn't do anything. We don't
need your sort here.

03:22.008 --> 03:24.008
And don't expect any references.

03:32.408 --> 03:37.328
Agnes, I'm glad I caught you.
Someone left this for you.

04:14.168 --> 04:16.887
This Selfridge seems to have a
high opinion of himself.

04:16.928 --> 04:19.368
Well, he's American. That's what
they're like.

04:23.328 --> 04:27.968
Gentlemen, welcome to Selfridge and
Waring.

04:33.848 --> 04:36.448
You know, you're standing on the
very spot

04:36.488 --> 04:40.808
where the biggest and best
department store in the whole world

04:40.848 --> 04:43.928
is shortly going to rise up out of
the rubble.

04:43.968 --> 04:47.408
With respect, sir, we're standing in
a hole in the ground

04:47.448 --> 04:49.768
at the dead end of Oxford Street.

04:49.808 --> 04:52.648
This is no ordinary hole.

04:52.688 --> 04:55.328
This is a million dollar hole.

04:55.368 --> 04:57.088
And in less than one year...

04:57.128 --> 05:01.808
Yes. ONE year... this will be the
live end of Oxford Street.

05:02.568 --> 05:08.528
Gentlemen, this is the best site
in London.

05:10.008 --> 05:13.208
Ah, here's my partner. Mr Waring.

05:13.248 --> 05:15.968
Better late than never. Come join
the party. Stop!

05:16.008 --> 05:17.888
Now!

05:20.728 --> 05:23.248
A word with you in private,
Selfridge.

05:26.168 --> 05:28.168
It's over. I'm pulling out.

05:28.208 --> 05:30.208
What the hell are you talking about?

05:30.248 --> 05:32.248
You've ignored all our agreements.

05:32.288 --> 05:36.008
This ridiculous band. To entertain
the construction workers.

05:36.048 --> 05:38.928
Hiring staff when your store isn't
even built yet.

05:38.968 --> 05:42.168
Your reckless advertising policy.
The whole thing is madness.

05:42.208 --> 05:45.168
We shook on this. You gave me
your word as an English gentleman.

05:45.208 --> 05:48.488
I'm sorry. These things happen.
I will ask just one thing.

05:48.528 --> 05:52.448
What's that? Don't breathe a word to
anyone until we're up and running.

05:52.488 --> 05:57.088
You swear to that. All right.
Then I consider myself released.

05:57.128 --> 05:59.048
Goodbye, Mr Waring.

06:06.288 --> 06:10.208
Gentlemen, my assistants will give
you all the literature you need

06:10.248 --> 06:12.768
about my new store.

06:12.808 --> 06:16.768
Now, if you have any questions, my
door is always open to you.

06:27.728 --> 06:31.928
Mr Selfridge, how's the partnership
with old Waring holding up?

06:32.928 --> 06:36.368
Who wants to know?
Frank Edwards. London Evening News.

06:36.408 --> 06:39.568
I know who you are even if our paths
haven't crossed.

06:39.608 --> 06:43.488
People tell me that you are one
of the best connected men in London.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.528
I know it from top to bottom, sir.

06:45.568 --> 06:49.048
The press will always be friends
of mine in my store.

06:49.088 --> 06:51.528
We're gonna be making news,
Mr Edwards.

06:51.568 --> 06:53.568
And I can put you ahead of the pack.

06:53.608 --> 06:57.088
I put aside a huge advertising budget
for the right sort of papers.

06:57.128 --> 07:00.528
But I need to be talked about by the
right people.

07:00.568 --> 07:04.328
It would be a pleasure to show you
the town.

07:09.728 --> 07:13.168
Woman, lovely woman. What a sex you

Payday today, I believe.
Yes, Mrs Payne.

08:36.768 --> 08:40.128
So you'll be down with the rent
later? Yes, Mrs Payne.

08:43.528 --> 08:45.888
She's been on about that rent
all day.

08:45.928 --> 08:48.128
You'd better go down and give it
to her.

08:48.168 --> 08:50.488
I haven't got it, George.
What?

08:50.528 --> 08:54.688
It wasn't my fault. There was this
customer. Monday, it was.

08:54.728 --> 08:58.328
I've been looking for another place
all week. What are you telling me?

08:58.368 --> 09:01.048
I've been dismissed.

09:01.088 --> 09:02.928
Christ!

09:02.968 --> 09:06.008
It's all right. It's going to be all
right. I will get another job.

09:06.048 --> 09:09.528
How we gonna pay the rent now?
Why does it always have to be me?

09:09.568 --> 09:12.208
Why can't you get a job?
Do you not think I've been trying?!

09:12.248 --> 09:14.848
I've been everywhere. I've tried
everything!

09:16.448 --> 09:18.448
Let go, George.

09:20.288 --> 09:22.288
I'm sorry, Agnes.

09:26.728 --> 09:30.128
Christ. If I thought you were gonna
turn out like him. I'm not.

09:30.168 --> 09:32.368
I didn't mean it, Agnes.

09:32.408 --> 09:34.408
Agnes, what are we gonna do?

09:34.848 --> 09:37.248
I daresay I could find my way
blindfold backstage

09:37.288 --> 09:39.528
in any theatre in London.
Here we are.

09:39.568 --> 09:41.568
Ah, yes.

09:41.608 --> 09:43.608
Who is it?

09:43.648 --> 09:45.928
An old friend. And a new one.

09:45.968 --> 09:48.448
Frank Edwards. Come on in, then.

09:50.208 --> 09:52.208
I haven't seen you in a long while.

09:52.248 --> 09:54.728
Now I see you I can't think
why I stayed away.

09:56.648 --> 10:00.048
Allow me to introduce my good friend
Harry Gordon Selfridge.

10:00.808 --> 10:04.008
Delighted to meet you.
Do make yourselves comfortable.

10:04.048 --> 10:06.768
Champagne? None for me, thanks.

10:06.808 --> 10:09.208
Mr Selfridge.

10:11.128 --> 10:14.048
THE Mr Selfridge?
I guess I must be.

10:14.088 --> 10:15.248
Well...

10:16.288 --> 10:19.568
I was knocked out with your
performance this evening, Miss Love.

10:19.608 --> 10:23.808
So he was. He couldn't keep his eyes
off you. No more could I, of course.

10:23.848 --> 10:27.248
Well, that's the compliments dealt
with. What do you boys want?

10:27.288 --> 10:31.328
If it's my company for the evening,
I have to disappoint you.

10:31.368 --> 10:34.688
I'm already spoken for.
That is a bitter blow.

10:34.728 --> 10:38.568
In fact, I must get dressed.
If you will excuse me.

10:38.608 --> 10:41.088
Of course. Forgive the intrusion.
Oh, no.

10:41.128 --> 10:43.288
I didn't mean you had to leave.

10:43.328 --> 10:46.328
I'll pop behind the screen.
Quite decent you see.

10:48.008 --> 10:50.088
So, Mr Selfridge,

10:50.128 --> 10:52.848
you're the man who knows
what women really want, are you?

10:52.888 --> 10:55.448
Gives one a funny feeling
to think that here's a man

10:55.488 --> 10:57.328
who knows us inside out.

11:00.288 --> 11:03.888
I was rather hoping you might come to
see me in the office sometime.

11:03.928 --> 11:06.928
I have a proposition that I might
want to put to you.

11:06.968 --> 11:12.328
A proposition? Well, I am very busy
but I am intrigued.

11:14.328 --> 11:16.328
I'm sure I could try and fit you in.

11:17.408 --> 11:19.248
Wonderful.

11:19.288 --> 11:22.848
Here's my card. Miss Love.

11:22.888 --> 11:24.768
Thank you...

11:24.808 --> 11:26.888
Mr Selfridge.

11:28.168 --> 11:30.168
Pa? Hey, Pa!

11:31.688 --> 11:33.688
We missed you.

11:35.568 --> 11:39.928
Oh, Mom. Well, son, it's a long way
from Battle Creek. That it is.

11:40.728 --> 11:42.888
Hello, my love. Hello.

11:42.928 --> 11:44.408
Mwah!

11:44.448 --> 11:46.168
Come on. I'll show you around.

11:46.208 --> 11:48.288
Watch your step.
Get out of the rain.

11:49.968 --> 11:51.528
Take a look, kids. Go on.

11:51.568 --> 11:53.568
Come on.

11:54.208 --> 11:56.208
Thank you.

11:56.768 --> 11:58.768
- Who wants to see upstairs?
- Me!

11:59.648 --> 12:01.208
Gordon, you're straight ahead.

12:01.248 --> 12:03.728
And girls, I thought you'd all like
to share.

12:08.528 --> 12:11.328
Oh, Harry.
I had it shipped in from Paris.

12:12.688 --> 12:14.688
Box sprung.

12:15.528 --> 12:18.248
I have missed you so much.

12:21.168 --> 12:23.368
You won't get a moment's peace
from me.

12:23.408 --> 12:26.488
Just like it was in Chicago?
Just like.

12:32.048 --> 12:35.368
Morning, Mr Selfridge. Hiya,
Mr Crabb. Everything hunky dory?

12:35.408 --> 12:37.808
I wouldn't exactly say that, Mr
Selfridge. Why not?

12:37.848 --> 12:40.568
I'm concerned that Mr Waring's money
is not in yet.

12:40.608 --> 12:43.208
Oh, don't worry, Crabb. Everything is
gonna be fine.

12:43.248 --> 12:45.928
I hope you made it clear there's an
element of urgency.

12:45.968 --> 12:48.488
We've already spend £20,000 on
advertising.

12:48.528 --> 12:51.128
There's a demand in for ground rent
of £10,000.

12:51.168 --> 12:54.048
The builders are refusing to move
forward without bill payment.

12:54.088 --> 12:57.088
I said, "Don't worry." It's my job to
worry, Mr Selfridge.

12:57.128 --> 12:59.488
Well, do it somewhere else. There's
a good fellow.

13:02.928 --> 13:05.088
Sir, the new heads of department are
here.

13:05.128 --> 13:07.608
New heads of department?
Gonna get ahead of the game.

13:07.648 --> 13:11.128
Crabb, meet your new colleagues. All
well, Miss Blenkinsop?

13:11.168 --> 13:13.128
Oh, yes, Mr Selfridge.

13:13.168 --> 13:17.848
- Good morning to you all.
- Good morning, Mr Selfridge.

13:17.888 --> 13:21.208
Well, don't you all look fine
and dandy.

13:21.248 --> 13:23.728
First off, I'd like to say
congratulations.

13:23.768 --> 13:26.728
You are in at the beginning of
something amazing.

13:26.768 --> 13:29.928
The other business houses may have
started from lowly beginnings

13:29.968 --> 13:33.448
but, with your help, Selfridges will
be born great.

13:33.488 --> 13:36.528
I know you don't know each other yet
but let me just tell you

13:36.568 --> 13:39.848
you have been picked out because you
are the cream of the crop.

13:39.888 --> 13:41.888
The best that London has to offer.

13:41.928 --> 13:45.608
You're all wondering why I have
employed you without a store
to put you in.

13:45.648 --> 13:47.768
I am giving you the opportunity of a
lifetime.

13:47.808 --> 13:51.248
12 months to scour the world for the
finest merchandise.

13:51.288 --> 13:55.968
WE are going to show the world how
to make shopping thrilling.

13:57.648 --> 14:01.968
Any questions? Mr Selfridge,
when you say, "No expense spared"

14:02.008 --> 14:05.328
how literally are we to take that?
Absolutely literally.

14:05.368 --> 14:08.368
I want product range and I want
product quality.

14:08.408 --> 14:10.888
I want merchandise that people will
desire.

14:10.928 --> 14:13.328
Merchandise people don't even know
they will desire

14:13.368 --> 14:16.088
until they see it right in front of
their eyes.

14:16.128 --> 14:18.128
Now, I expect great things from you.

14:18.168 --> 14:22.368
Pack your bags, ladies and gentlemen.
Go and bring the world to Selfridges!

14:33.048 --> 14:36.608
It does all seem awfully ambitious.
Too good to be true.

14:36.648 --> 14:38.648
I know.

14:38.688 --> 14:41.408
I left Debenham and Freebody rather
in the lurch.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.448
I'm sure they wouldn't take me back.

14:43.488 --> 14:46.248
I don't know how I'd manage if it
didn't come off.

14:46.288 --> 14:48.408
I mean, the store's not even built
yet.

14:48.448 --> 14:51.808
I've heard whispers that he hasn't
got the money together yet.

14:51.848 --> 14:55.248
These things are most likely spread
about by jealous rivals.

14:55.288 --> 14:57.288
Yes. Of course. Of course.

15:04.048 --> 15:06.048
All the same.

15:06.088 --> 15:08.088
Mr Crabb!

15:11.528 --> 15:14.648
We can rely on our salary until the
store opens, can't we?

15:14.688 --> 15:17.888
I have an invalid wife at home.
Absolutely, Mr Grove.

15:17.928 --> 15:19.928
All is in order.

15:28.016 --> 15:30.016
Ice cream, I guess.
Ice cream.

15:30.044 --> 15:31.924
We'll have a whole department
for ice cream.

15:32.007 --> 15:34.487
Make sure it's real American ice
cream. Of course.

15:34.875 --> 15:36.655
Gordon. Toys and guns.

15:36.730 --> 15:39.090
Toys and guns. Make a list of the
best kind.

15:39.130 --> 15:42.930
Beatrice. Can't we have a special
place for children to play?

15:42.970 --> 15:46.450
While the moms are shopping?
That is a great idea, B.

15:46.490 --> 15:49.130
Good morning. Good morning. Listen
to this.

15:49.170 --> 15:51.650
Mr Selfridge's ideas are
grandiose

15:51.690 --> 15:53.330
and his confidence boundless.

15:53.370 --> 15:57.490
We shall await with interest to see
whether that confidence is misplaced.

15:59.570 --> 16:03.450
And this fellow here accuses me of
tempting people to dishonesty

16:03.490 --> 16:06.810
by proposing to put the goods out on
open display!

16:06.850 --> 16:08.610
Out into the garden, children.

16:08.650 --> 16:11.010
What is it with the press over here?

16:11.050 --> 16:13.050
It seems as if they WANT us to fail.

16:13.090 --> 16:15.090
It's a beautiful morning.

16:15.130 --> 16:19.170
There's always prejudice against
something that's new.

16:19.210 --> 16:22.050
But can't they give a fellow a
chance? They will.

16:22.090 --> 16:24.410
Once they see the store for real.

16:24.450 --> 16:26.730
The garden is so beautiful this
morning.

16:26.770 --> 16:29.890
Why don't we join the children? Hm?
I'm late. I'm sorry.

16:31.770 --> 16:34.490
But I will see you later.
Oh. All right.

16:38.290 --> 16:41.770
Come on, girl. Those floors aren't
going to scrub themselves.

16:58.210 --> 17:02.010
Good morning, sir. Morning.
Good morning, Mr Selfridge. Morning.

17:02.050 --> 17:04.650
- Good morning.
- Morning, Mr Selfridge.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.690
Have you seen the papers?
Yeah. Not so good.

17:06.730 --> 17:10.530
They'll change their tune once they
see how much we're gonna put
into advertising.

17:10.569 --> 17:13.730
And when their wives tell 'em what a
great place we are to shop at.

17:13.770 --> 17:15.609
You clearly haven't seen this.
What?

17:15.650 --> 17:17.849
Waring's pulling out. What?

17:17.890 --> 17:21.089
He promised me. I have to say, I did
warn you, Mr Selfridge.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.369
He swore he'd keep it out of the
papers.

17:26.730 --> 17:29.450
Mr Selfridge? Mr Selfridge! Yes!

17:29.490 --> 17:32.130
Am I to understand that you knew
about this already?

17:32.170 --> 17:36.530
He did say something last week. So
much for English gentleman's
agreements.

17:36.570 --> 17:39.690
And you thought it proper not
to inform me, as Head of Finance,

17:39.730 --> 17:42.330
while you authorised all sorts of
expenditure

17:42.370 --> 17:44.370
without the capital to back it up?

17:46.090 --> 17:49.410
Mr Crabb, this is business. It
happens all the time.

17:49.450 --> 17:53.210
You realise it's going to be
difficult to find a backer
at this late stage?

17:53.250 --> 17:55.010
And in the event you do find
someone,

17:55.050 --> 17:58.650
they'll know we're in a poor
position with building
about to start.

17:58.690 --> 18:01.330
I hate to think what rate
of interest they'll make us pay!

18:01.370 --> 18:05.330
Well, you're just a little ray of
sunshine, ain't you, Mr Crabb

18:06.370 --> 18:10.730
Mr Selfridge, I left a very good
position to join you

18:10.770 --> 18:14.570
but I have to say that the reckless
way that you conduct your business,

18:14.610 --> 18:18.890
dismays and yes... frightens me.

18:19.490 --> 18:21.810
It frightens me too sometimes,
Mr Crabb.

18:23.370 --> 18:25.450
Hold your nerve. Keep your head
down.

18:25.490 --> 18:29.250
Let me handle the rest. I think
we should redouble the advertising.

18:31.330 --> 18:32.330
Ye-ah.

18:38.890 --> 18:40.890
Frank Edwards. Just the man.

18:40.930 --> 18:43.930
Lady Mae is a wondrous woman.

18:43.970 --> 18:47.250
Really she's Lady Loxley
but everyone calls her Lady Mae.

18:48.490 --> 18:52.130
Used to be a good-time girl before
she snaffled Lord L.

18:52.170 --> 18:54.170
Knows everyone who is anyone in
London.

18:54.210 --> 18:56.890
She could get you an investor at the
drop of a hat.

19:00.570 --> 19:03.770
Lady Mae, may I introduce my good
friend Harry Selfridge.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.690
Surely not the Selfridge we've been
hearing and reading about?

19:06.730 --> 19:10.530
The very same. Well, we are
honoured.

19:10.570 --> 19:12.610
The honour is all mine, Lady Mae.

19:12.650 --> 19:16.290
Is Lord Loxley in town? No, Frank.
Lord Loxley is in the country.

19:17.570 --> 19:21.250
Lord Loxley is generally in the
country and I'm generally in town.

19:21.290 --> 19:24.730
There are so many different ways to
run a marriage, don't you think?

19:24.770 --> 19:28.290
And to never see each other. That's
one of the very best.

19:28.330 --> 19:29.930
I second that.

19:31.450 --> 19:33.450
Excuse me.

19:37.770 --> 19:39.970
Come and sit down with me, Mr
Selfridge.

19:44.770 --> 19:48.130
So, you've been creating quite a
stir, haven't you?

19:48.170 --> 19:52.210
I certainly hope so. And yet, London
don't seem to care for you.

19:52.250 --> 19:54.370
Oh? How do you make that out?

19:54.410 --> 19:56.930
London doesn't like being shown how
to do things.

19:56.970 --> 19:59.970
Especially by outsiders.
Is that how you feel too?

20:00.010 --> 20:02.010
Not necessarily.

20:03.010 --> 20:05.530
I rather like being shown how to do
new things.

20:05.570 --> 20:08.170
Especially by a man who knows what
he's about.

20:08.210 --> 20:12.250
But... people like us aren't used to
going shopping.

20:13.850 --> 20:17.890
It's not considered smart.
A gentleman will visit his tailor.

20:17.930 --> 20:20.810
A lady will send for her dressmaker
and so on.

20:20.850 --> 20:23.490
We are going to have to change the
fashion.

20:23.530 --> 20:25.530
We? Hm.

20:26.490 --> 20:28.490
Oh, yes. Of course.

20:29.250 --> 20:31.250
That's why you're here.

20:31.290 --> 20:34.370
Oh, no. I would never...
I do read the papers, Mr Selfridge.

20:34.410 --> 20:37.130
You need a new backer and you need
him fast

20:37.170 --> 20:39.570
or your visit to our island will be
cut rather short.

20:39.610 --> 20:42.810
What you read in the papers ain't
necessarily so, ma'am.

20:42.850 --> 20:45.050
But I am flattered that you take
such an interest.

20:45.090 --> 20:49.530
We do like to give our ex-colonials
a helping hand when they need it.

20:49.570 --> 20:54.650
Who says that I need a helping hand?
Everyone, Mr Selfridge.

20:58.530 --> 21:01.930
Tony. Oh. You're a disgrace.

21:03.650 --> 21:05.730
I know. I know. Don't be a bore.

21:05.770 --> 21:08.130
Try not to make an exhibition of
yourself, darling.

21:08.170 --> 21:10.970
How did the audience go? She's quite
a woman.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.010
Is that her son she's with?
Son?

21:14.050 --> 21:16.050
Good job you didn't say that to her!

21:16.090 --> 21:20.650
No, that's young Tony Travers. He's
her lover. Is that so?

21:20.690 --> 21:22.690
That's Lady Mae for you.

21:30.370 --> 21:32.890
Good evening, sir.
May I take your coat, sir?

21:32.930 --> 21:36.770
Oh, very good of you to wait up for
me, Fraser but there's no need.

21:36.810 --> 21:41.250
I like to ensure everybody is safely
home before I bolt the door, sir.

21:41.290 --> 21:43.290
Ah. I guess you do.

21:46.330 --> 21:48.330
Everything all right, sir?

21:49.490 --> 21:52.570
Everything is fine, Fraser.
Absolutely fine.

21:52.610 --> 21:54.610
I'm glad to hear it, sir.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.490
Good night, sir.

22:27.010 --> 22:29.410
Hey, Pa.
You should be asleep.

22:29.450 --> 22:31.450
Pa, what's a huckster?

22:33.770 --> 22:36.130
He's a man who buys and sells things.

22:36.170 --> 22:37.290
Oh.

22:39.370 --> 22:41.370
Why do you ask?

22:44.730 --> 22:48.090
Well, it's just one of the kids at
school said

22:48.130 --> 22:50.650
"Your guv'nor is nothing but a
common huckster."

22:50.690 --> 22:54.370
What did you say? Well, it sounded
insulting so I knocked him down.

22:55.130 --> 22:58.890
Well, he probably did mean for it to
be insulting

22:58.930 --> 23:01.650
but there's nothing wrong with being
a huckster.

23:02.450 --> 23:04.530
You tell him one day you're gonna
run the firm

23:04.570 --> 23:08.210
and he's gonna be asking you
for a job. OK? Yes, Pa.

23:08.250 --> 23:10.130
All right. Get some sleep.

23:11.970 --> 23:13.970
Good night, Pa. Good night.

23:19.130 --> 23:20.130
Hey.

23:21.330 --> 23:23.530
I fell asleep.

23:27.130 --> 23:29.210
You smell so good.

23:29.250 --> 23:31.530
Did you have a good time?

23:31.570 --> 23:33.570
I had an interesting time.

23:34.170 --> 23:36.370
But I'm so glad to be back here
with you.

23:36.410 --> 23:39.450
Flatterer!
It's the God's honest truth, Rose.

23:39.490 --> 23:42.610
There's no-one in the world
I'd rather be with than you.

24:03.054 --> 24:05.054
Are you doing all right, son?

24:06.454 --> 24:08.454
Maybe we shouldn't have come, Ma.

24:12.334 --> 24:14.334
You're in trouble, right?

24:14.374 --> 24:16.374
I'm in over my head.

24:17.454 --> 24:20.734
You've been in over your head before
and come out of it fine.

24:21.734 --> 24:24.894
Anyway, what's the worst that could
happen?

24:28.214 --> 24:31.774
Bankruptcy. My family out on the
street.

24:33.974 --> 24:37.294
We came from nothing.
We're not going back there.

24:40.454 --> 24:42.534
There must be something you can do.

24:45.654 --> 24:48.534
There is someone who can help me find
an investor

24:48.608 --> 24:50.608
but I do not wanna be beholden.

24:51.587 --> 24:54.067
Is that your pride talking?
No, it's my gut.

24:55.067 --> 24:57.147
This person could be very dangerous.

24:57.187 --> 24:59.187
So? Outsmart them.

25:00.707 --> 25:03.027
To sup with the devil you need a
long spoon.

25:03.707 --> 25:05.707
You taught me that.

25:05.747 --> 25:07.747
You know, Harry...

25:08.747 --> 25:12.707
if your father could see you now,
he'd be so proud. No!

25:12.747 --> 25:14.827
What? Just don't talk to me about
him.

25:16.787 --> 25:19.067
What do you mean?
Your father was a hero.

25:22.267 --> 25:25.347
You remember him any way you please
but as I remember it,

25:25.387 --> 25:27.387
it was always just you and me.

25:36.956 --> 25:38.356
Lady Mae.

25:38.396 --> 25:42.956
I'm surprised and flattered you're
here again so soon, Mr Selfridge.

25:42.996 --> 25:46.796
I wanted to introduce you to
my friend, Lady Mae. Henri Leclair.

25:46.856 --> 25:48.856
Just arrived from America.

25:48.896 --> 25:52.056
Are you an artist, Monsieur Leclair?
You have the look of one.

25:52.096 --> 25:56.176
Actually, Henri is the best window
display man in the world.

25:56.216 --> 25:58.216
And here we all are.

25:59.416 --> 26:01.416
How delightful.

26:02.336 --> 26:04.816
What can I offer you gentlemen?
Champagne?

26:04.856 --> 26:07.656
None for me, thanks. I don't drink.

26:07.696 --> 26:11.016
I would be delighted. We'll have
champagne, please, Pimble.

26:11.056 --> 26:12.256
And coffee.

26:14.296 --> 26:17.456
Monsieur Leclair, tell me what it is
that you do.

26:18.336 --> 26:20.336
Oh... erm...

26:21.136 --> 26:24.336
I don't dress women like fashion
designers do.

26:24.376 --> 26:26.136
I dress space.

26:26.176 --> 26:30.096
Each Selfridges window will be like
a painting.

26:30.136 --> 26:32.536
And the people looking in imagine
themselves

26:32.576 --> 26:34.576
in the story we are telling.

26:34.616 --> 26:37.776
Maybe in the window there is
handsome young man

26:37.816 --> 26:41.216
and his beautiful lady and
he's looking at her with passion.

26:42.776 --> 26:44.776
Maybe they are going motoring.

26:44.816 --> 26:47.256
You'd put a motor car in the window?

26:47.296 --> 26:49.176
Yeah. Why not?

26:50.976 --> 26:54.936
How fabulously extravagant. Who's
driving?

26:54.976 --> 26:57.536
The lady or the gentleman?

26:57.576 --> 27:00.176
That's a good question.

27:02.496 --> 27:05.976
I must say, Mr Selfridge, yours does
seem a thrilling enterprise.

27:06.016 --> 27:09.216
One I would love to share with my
friends.

27:09.256 --> 27:12.776
And we must be the best of friends,
mustn't we, Harry.

27:13.336 --> 27:17.856
Of course, a lady in my position
occasionally needs a favour.

27:18.856 --> 27:21.536
I may call on you from time to time
in that regard.

27:22.536 --> 27:23.976
Mightn't I?

27:26.096 --> 27:28.816
One good turn always deserves
another.

27:28.856 --> 27:31.416
Then we understand each other.

27:33.216 --> 27:35.616
Are you fond of shooting?

27:35.656 --> 27:37.336
S-Shooting?

27:37.376 --> 27:40.616
I think you might enjoy it.

27:40.656 --> 27:42.456
Come down to the country on Friday.

27:42.496 --> 27:44.936
There's someone I'd like you to
meet.

27:44.976 --> 27:48.256
Monsieur Leclair, as you are a man
of taste,

27:48.296 --> 27:52.496
will you make sure that Mr Selfridge
arrives in the latest
knickerbockers?

27:52.536 --> 27:54.216
Knickerbockers?

27:55.336 --> 27:57.336
I do so enjoy a shapely calf.

28:07.456 --> 28:09.976
I'm going to be straight with you,
Selfridge.

28:10.016 --> 28:14.136
I choose my business ventures
as I choose my horses.

28:15.016 --> 28:17.696
With the horses, I look them
straight in the eye

28:17.736 --> 28:20.416
as I'm looking at you now and I take
a view.

28:21.376 --> 28:23.376
I'm generally right but if I'm not.

28:24.896 --> 28:28.776
Well, don't waste time. It's
straight off to the knacker's yard.

28:28.816 --> 28:32.296
I happen to think you're all right.
If it turns out I'm wrong...

28:37.816 --> 28:39.736
All right?

28:39.776 --> 28:41.776
All right, Mr Musker.

29:36.096 --> 29:38.416
Make sure you have your references
ready.

29:39.136 --> 29:41.136
No interview without a reference.

29:42.816 --> 29:46.536
Mr Selfridge doesn't like haughty
and he doesn't like obsequious.

29:46.576 --> 29:48.936
Friendly and respectful.
That's the watchword.

29:48.976 --> 29:51.456
The Chief wants men and women who
are ambitious

29:51.496 --> 29:53.736
and wish to better themselves.

29:53.776 --> 29:57.096
No flirting. No love affairs if they
want to keep their jobs.

29:57.136 --> 30:00.376
And female assistants who marry will
have to leave.

30:00.416 --> 30:02.416
Make sure they know that.

30:02.456 --> 30:05.056
There are five applicants for every
position.

30:05.096 --> 30:07.336
So we can afford to pick the very
best.

30:08.336 --> 30:10.616
Look at their shoes, their
fingernails.

30:10.656 --> 30:13.096
And above all,
look deep into their eyes

30:13.136 --> 30:15.336
and see if you can't fathom their
souls.

30:35.296 --> 30:36.536
Yes, miss?

30:36.576 --> 30:40.176
If you please, sir. I've come to see
the master.

30:40.216 --> 30:41.616
Mr Selfridge.

30:41.656 --> 30:43.656
I've come about a position.

30:43.696 --> 30:45.696
Here? In the house?

30:45.736 --> 30:47.736
No. In his shop. I'm a shop girl.

30:47.776 --> 30:51.256
But don't you know this is
Mr Selfridge's private residence?

30:51.296 --> 30:54.456
Well, this is the address he gave
me.

30:54.496 --> 30:56.776
Look. He gave me his card.

31:00.296 --> 31:02.416
Please. I've come ever such a long
way.

31:04.936 --> 31:06.456
Come in, Miss.

31:12.296 --> 31:15.136
Would you wait over there, please,
miss?

31:15.176 --> 31:17.816
I'll go and see if Mr Selfridge is
at home.

31:38.736 --> 31:41.656
Now, what's all this about?

31:41.696 --> 31:44.616
If you please, sir. I was... erm...

31:44.656 --> 31:47.736
I was hoping there might be a
position for me. I hardly think...

31:47.776 --> 31:50.976
I served you on the glove counter at
Gamages...

31:51.936 --> 31:53.936
l-last year.

31:53.976 --> 31:55.616
Agnes Towler.

31:55.656 --> 31:58.416
And you were so kind as to buy
these for me.

32:01.936 --> 32:04.296
Oh, of course. I remember.

32:05.336 --> 32:07.816
I was very demanding. You were very
patient.

32:07.856 --> 32:10.696
The floorwalker was very tall.

32:10.736 --> 32:15.296
So, you want to leave Gamages
and come work for me, is that right?

32:15.336 --> 32:17.336
I was dismissed, sir.

32:18.336 --> 32:20.336
Really? Why was that?

32:20.376 --> 32:23.896
Erm... conduct unbecoming, sir.

32:24.736 --> 32:26.736
It was... It was that same day.

32:26.776 --> 32:30.056
He said I shouldn't have let you
behind the counter

32:30.096 --> 32:32.096
and get the stock out.

32:33.016 --> 32:35.016
I'm so sorry.

32:35.056 --> 32:37.576
It's all right. I never liked it
there, sir.

32:37.616 --> 32:40.376
I'd much rather come and work for
you.

32:40.416 --> 32:43.096
All the... All the girls are talking
about Selfridges.

32:43.136 --> 32:46.376
You have no idea what it's like to
work for me, though.

32:46.416 --> 32:48.776
I won't tell a lie, sir. Work's
been...

32:48.816 --> 32:52.416
It's been very hard to get any work
these past months.

32:52.456 --> 32:55.496
And without a reference, you see...

32:55.536 --> 32:59.056
I got you into this mess. The least I
can do is give you a chance now.

32:59.096 --> 33:04.416
Come tomorrow morning. 9am sharp. And
ask for the Chief of Staff.

33:04.456 --> 33:07.336
Y-Yes, Mr Selfridge.
Thank you, Mr Selfridge.

33:08.336 --> 33:09.656
Fraser. Yes, sir.

33:09.696 --> 33:13.496
Get Miss Towler a cab home and pay
for the driver.

33:13.536 --> 33:15.536
Certainly, sir. This way, Miss.

33:17.285 --> 33:19.285
Sorry. Too tall. Next.

33:20.550 --> 33:22.550
Thank you. Move along, please.

33:23.338 --> 33:25.338
Thank you. Next.

33:25.378 --> 33:27.378
Thank you. Move along.

33:28.338 --> 33:30.458
I'm sorry, sir. All right. Move
along.

33:31.498 --> 33:34.378
Next. Thank you. Move along, please.

33:36.538 --> 33:38.538
Thank you. This side, Miss.

33:40.458 --> 33:42.458
Thank you. Next.

33:43.138 --> 33:45.418
Thank you. Would you wait there,
please?

33:50.698 --> 33:52.698
This is a game, isn't it?

33:52.858 --> 33:55.178
I hope I remembered to wish behind
my ears.

33:56.258 --> 33:58.258
Nervous? A bit.

33:58.298 --> 34:00.298
Bet you'll be fine.
Miss Towler.

34:01.178 --> 34:03.178
Oh, that's me. Good luck.

34:03.218 --> 34:05.898
Thank you. Could you wait
there, please?

34:09.400 --> 34:10.400
Hands.

34:12.721 --> 34:16.241
Previous experience? I worked on the
glove counter at Gamages.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.360
References?

34:20.400 --> 34:24.081
I haven't got any.
I'm sorry, Miss Towler. Next.

34:24.121 --> 34:26.681
But I explained to Mr Selfridge.

34:27.681 --> 34:29.681
YOU explained to Mr Selfridge?

34:29.721 --> 34:32.561
Yes. And he said to speak to the
Chief of Staff.

34:35.121 --> 34:37.601
Did he indeed? Well, we shall see
about that.

34:39.801 --> 34:42.841
Mr Grove! Yes, Miss Mardle.

34:43.960 --> 34:46.801
I have a Miss Towler. Miss Towler.

34:48.081 --> 34:50.081
Yes. I have a note about Miss
Towler.

34:52.641 --> 34:55.440
It's very irregular. Well, who are
we to reason why.

34:55.481 --> 34:57.481
Straight from the Chief himself.

35:04.481 --> 35:07.881
Well, it would seem, Miss Towler,
that you are a special case.

35:07.921 --> 35:11.161
You will be starting as a senior
assistant in Accessories.

35:11.201 --> 35:14.201
And I must tell you that Accessories
is my department.

35:14.241 --> 35:16.881
Which means you will be reporting to
me.

35:16.921 --> 35:18.921
Mr Colleano.

35:18.961 --> 35:20.961
Mr Conway.

35:30.841 --> 35:34.161
I don't see anything special about
her. No. Nor me.

35:35.001 --> 35:37.001
Ah, ladies. Please follow me.

35:37.041 --> 35:39.721
Mr Selfridge himself wants to have a
look at you.

35:50.121 --> 35:53.321
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning, Mr Selfridge.

35:53.361 --> 35:55.881
Like the uniforms?
Oh, yes, Mr Selfridge.

35:55.921 --> 35:58.521
Glad to hear it because I designed
them myself.

35:58.561 --> 36:02.161
Learnt your scripts? Yes, Mr
Selfridge. Give me the first floor.

36:02.201 --> 36:05.601
First floor for menswear, luggage
and hairdressing.

36:06.481 --> 36:08.761
Please stand clear of the closing
doors.

36:08.801 --> 36:11.001
Thank you, ladies. Good as poetry.

36:47.441 --> 36:49.721
Come on, ladies. Get to work.

36:49.761 --> 36:51.761
We open in a week.

36:53.641 --> 36:55.641
Miss Towler.

36:57.201 --> 37:00.601
We have three girls in this
department but four in Accessories.

37:00.641 --> 37:04.641
So, if Miss Towler doesn't work out,
I'd like to know about it.

37:06.081 --> 37:08.081
Thank you, Miss Mardle.

37:13.561 --> 37:14.921
A place for everything

37:14.961 --> 37:17.281
and everything in its place, Miss
Towler.

37:17.321 --> 37:19.321
And memorise as you go.

37:19.361 --> 37:23.161
To work in Accessories is to work in
the most exacting department.

37:23.201 --> 37:26.401
Ignorant people think we deal in
little trifling things.

37:26.441 --> 37:29.841
But the accomplished Accessories
Assistant has at her fingertips

37:29.881 --> 37:32.881
over 6,000 separate items of
merchandise

37:32.921 --> 37:35.761
and I shall expect you to know them
all and locate each one

37:35.801 --> 37:38.121
at a moment's notice. Is that
understood?

37:38.161 --> 37:40.161
Yes, Miss Mardle.

37:40.721 --> 37:43.081
I can't imagine what they were
thinking of.

37:43.121 --> 37:46.001
Appointing someone so young as a
senior assistant.

37:46.041 --> 37:49.801
But still. I can see you make a good
effort at presenting yourself.

37:49.841 --> 37:52.681
I just hope you won't let it go to
your head.

37:52.721 --> 37:54.721
I won't, Miss Mardle.

37:54.761 --> 37:56.801
I should hope not.

37:56.841 --> 37:59.641
I shall be watching you very
closely, Miss Towler.

38:00.641 --> 38:03.161
And you two. Have you nothing to do
but stare?!

38:03.201 --> 38:06.281
Get on with your work. Not long till
we open.

38:06.321 --> 38:08.321
Every second counts.

38:10.641 --> 38:12.641
Horrid old cat.

38:15.441 --> 38:17.441
And little Miss Towler.

38:17.481 --> 38:20.961
Our colleague. Senior assistant, if
you please.

38:21.001 --> 38:23.401
She's a bit of gutter slush if ever
I saw one.

38:47.241 --> 38:49.241
It's Ellen Love!

38:49.761 --> 38:53.361
It's not! It is! It's never!

38:54.761 --> 38:56.761
Please, Miss Love.

39:00.561 --> 39:04.001
Will you sign your photograph for
me, please?

39:04.041 --> 39:06.041
Of course I will, dear.

39:09.721 --> 39:13.401
And now could one of you kindly
direct me to Mr Selfridge's office?

39:13.441 --> 39:17.201
Oh, of course, Miss Love. Should you
like to take the stairs or lift?

39:17.241 --> 39:19.561
Oh, the lift I should think,
don't you?

39:19.601 --> 39:21.601
This way, please.

39:25.281 --> 39:28.161
Mr Selfridge's office, please.
Certainly, Miss.

39:39.041 --> 39:41.041
Haven't I seen you before, dear?

39:42.241 --> 39:46.561
Yes, Miss Love. We were both in the
chorus of Frilly Dolls at the
Gaiety.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.081
Mabel.

39:48.121 --> 39:51.441
That's right. What larks, eh?

39:51.481 --> 39:54.001
I haven't given up, you know.
Nor should you.

39:55.961 --> 40:00.001
Fourth floor, Director's Offices.

40:00.041 --> 40:02.121
Lovely diction, dear. Thank you.

40:02.161 --> 40:06.321
So, what's Mr Selfridge like as an
employer?

40:07.241 --> 40:10.241
He's very particular, Miss but he's
very kind as well.

40:10.641 --> 40:12.641
Very particular and very kind.

40:12.681 --> 40:16.081
I shall tell him you said that.
Oh, no, miss. Please don't.

40:16.121 --> 40:20.681
Why not? I don't think he would like
to think he was talked about.

40:22.721 --> 40:24.721
I think he'd love it.

40:31.161 --> 40:33.161
Miss Love to see Mr Selfridge.

40:33.201 --> 40:35.201
If you'd like to follow me.

40:40.881 --> 40:42.201
Miss Love.

40:47.361 --> 40:49.841
Well, here we are.

40:49.881 --> 40:51.801
Here we are.

40:53.721 --> 40:55.721
No chair.

40:55.761 --> 40:59.401
I don't like people hanging around,
present company excepted.

41:06.601 --> 41:08.601
I'll just sit here, then.

41:19.081 --> 41:23.681
I need people to understand the
essence of Selfridges.

41:24.241 --> 41:27.201
Beauty, elegance, quality.

41:28.241 --> 41:32.041
I want your face and your figure on
all our posters.

41:33.281 --> 41:35.841
You already embody the spirit of the
age.

41:35.881 --> 41:39.241
Women want to be like you and men
want to...

41:39.281 --> 41:42.041
Well, let's just say they want you
to be their sweetheart.

41:42.081 --> 41:44.721
To put it delicately.

41:46.281 --> 41:47.281
So...

41:48.961 --> 41:51.201
what do you think?

41:51.241 --> 41:54.161
I'm not going to give up the stage,
you know.

41:54.201 --> 41:57.241
I don't want you to.
One will enhance the other.

41:57.281 --> 42:00.201
And a little money will change
hands?

42:00.241 --> 42:04.961
Of course. It's a very important role
and you'll be handsomely recompensed.

42:07.161 --> 42:10.801
Well... I must say it does seem like
fun.

42:14.081 --> 42:17.081
Though it's not the proposition I
thought you'd have in mind.

42:17.121 --> 42:19.521
Oh. You're disappointed.

42:24.641 --> 42:26.641
I'm honoured by your proposition.

42:27.601 --> 42:29.601
And delighted to accept.

42:32.561 --> 42:34.561
Well, you know where to find me.

42:37.201 --> 42:39.201
Every night barring Sundays.

42:46.279 --> 42:48.279
So what was she like, Aggie?

42:48.319 --> 42:50.219
Very nice.

42:50.293 --> 42:52.293
You don't mind being Aggie.

42:52.333 --> 42:55.253
I always think of it as a sort of
scullery maid's name.

42:55.653 --> 42:58.693
Oh. Not that I'm casting
any aspersions.

43:00.253 --> 43:03.093
Oh, dear. The things that come out
of my mouth.

43:03.133 --> 43:05.813
No of fence taken I hope.
None at all, Kitty.

43:07.973 --> 43:11.053
We used to have a cat at home called
Kitty.

43:11.093 --> 43:14.333
Oh, Miss Mardle, isn't it? Yes.

43:14.373 --> 43:18.333
And this is your little treasure
house. Yes. Ladies.

43:18.373 --> 43:20.493
How can I help you Mr Leclair?

43:20.533 --> 43:24.693
I'm looking for something. I don't
know what it is yet. Maybe me.

43:24.733 --> 43:28.373
I need one detail for a window that
is almost complete.

43:28.413 --> 43:31.053
In this particular window, I am
creating a...

43:32.053 --> 43:34.053
a picture.

43:34.093 --> 43:37.573
Like a scene from a play. You
understand?

43:37.613 --> 43:41.533
A play in a theatre. A play in the
theatre. I understand perfectly.

43:41.573 --> 43:45.373
Good. So, we have two young ladies in
a garden.

43:45.413 --> 43:48.693
One of them is turning. Looking out
like this.

43:49.573 --> 43:53.413
Her hand shading her eyes as if she
is waiting for someone.

43:53.453 --> 43:57.413
The other is seated. Looking down
at something in her lap.

43:57.453 --> 44:01.573
And that something, that je ne sais
quoi,

44:01.613 --> 44:04.173
is the focus of the whole picture.

44:05.173 --> 44:09.253
So you want us to suggest what she
might be holding.

44:09.293 --> 44:12.573
This girl in the window. Exactly.

44:12.613 --> 44:15.693
That little something that will
complete the picture.

44:15.733 --> 44:17.933
I have it all except that one thing
so...

44:17.973 --> 44:21.773
Well, really, Mr Leclair, you cannot
expect us to do your job for you.

44:21.813 --> 44:23.813
Oh, no. No. No. No. Of course.

44:23.853 --> 44:26.933
And you're very busy here. Forgive
me. Please carry on.

44:28.133 --> 44:30.973
Mr Leclair. Sir.

44:32.533 --> 44:35.973
Erm... I thought, maybe, something
like this?

44:38.893 --> 44:40.893
A silk flower. Hm-mm.

44:41.813 --> 44:43.813
Well, it wouldn't fade, would it?

44:43.853 --> 44:45.853
It's very practical.

44:45.893 --> 44:47.933
And you think this colour?

44:47.973 --> 44:50.933
To stand out. Against the green.

44:52.120 --> 44:54.000
Well, it would do that.

44:54.040 --> 44:56.120
People might think that she was
given it as...

44:56.160 --> 44:58.160
As what?

44:59.160 --> 45:03.600
Well, as a token of love, as it
were.

45:08.120 --> 45:10.120
A token of love?

45:11.320 --> 45:14.160
Very good. I will think about it.

45:16.920 --> 45:18.920
Miss Towler.
Coming, Miss Mardle.

45:30.640 --> 45:34.000
What time would you like to dine
tonight, Ma'am?

45:34.040 --> 45:37.720
Mr Selfridge telephoned to say he
wouldn't be in this evening.

45:37.760 --> 45:40.480
He telephoned, you say?
Yes, Ma'am.

45:41.120 --> 45:43.800
We will dine at 7:30 as usual. Thank
you, Fraser.

45:44.920 --> 45:46.920
Very good, Ma'am.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.080
That's three nights this week.

45:53.600 --> 45:55.880
It's nice to have a little time
together.

45:55.920 --> 45:59.400
Not much chance of getting a word in
edgeways when he's around.

45:59.440 --> 46:00.440
Indeed.

46:17.920 --> 46:20.920
♪ I haven't been out of school long

46:21.840 --> 46:24.360
♪ And I haven't really found
my way

46:25.560 --> 46:27.960
Hello, there. You got the job, then.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.240
Yes. In Accessories.

46:31.280 --> 46:34.400
And you? I'm a waiter
in the Palm Court Restaurant.

46:34.440 --> 46:36.440
Oh, it's supposed to be beautiful.

46:37.560 --> 46:39.560
Do you want to come and see?

46:40.760 --> 46:44.240
I couldn't. What if we were caught?
Come on. Just a quick peek.

46:44.280 --> 46:47.760
In a couple of days, this place will
be heaving with customers.

46:47.800 --> 46:50.000
Why not? You only live once.

46:50.480 --> 46:55.600
♪ He's everything I ever
dreamed of ♪

46:59.680 --> 47:01.680
Oh, it's magical.

47:03.040 --> 47:05.520
Do you like working here?
It's all right.

47:05.560 --> 47:09.240
Of course we haven't had any
customers. We've been practising.

47:09.280 --> 47:11.680
I could practise on you if you like.

47:17.400 --> 47:19.200
Will this table suit, Miss?

47:21.760 --> 47:23.760
Come on. No-one's gonna come.

47:27.480 --> 47:29.480
All right, then.

47:30.920 --> 47:32.920
Thank you.

47:35.720 --> 47:37.720
Now, what can I get you, Miss?

47:37.760 --> 47:41.040
Oh, I don't know. I've never been
to a place like this.

47:41.080 --> 47:44.200
Well, might I suggest a glass of
sherry, Miss?

47:44.920 --> 47:47.800
Erm... All right, then.

47:47.840 --> 47:49.560
Just a small one.

47:53.320 --> 47:56.640
Actually, I feel bad about this.
What if someone catches us?

47:56.680 --> 48:00.680
They won't but if they did, I'll say
it's all part of my training.

48:00.720 --> 48:03.880
I'm so keen, I even carry on after
hours.

48:06.760 --> 48:08.760
There you are, Miss Towler.

48:08.800 --> 48:10.160
One small sherry.

48:13.520 --> 48:15.520
Well, aren't you going to have one?

48:15.560 --> 48:19.560
Drinking with the customer, Miss?
Strictly against the rules.

48:19.600 --> 48:21.600
But if you'll insist...

48:22.600 --> 48:24.160
I'll have a sip of yours.

48:35.200 --> 48:37.200
Delicioso.

48:40.880 --> 48:43.080
I'm gonna own a place like this
one day.

48:43.120 --> 48:45.160
Are you? Definitely.

48:45.200 --> 48:48.680
How about you?
Head Buyer in Accessories.

48:48.720 --> 48:50.720
Oh, I don't know.

48:51.640 --> 48:55.520
We've only just got here, haven't
we? Nothing wrong with ambition.

48:55.560 --> 48:57.560
Nothing wrong with having dreams.

48:57.600 --> 49:00.600
Selfridge himself started out
delivering newspapers.

49:02.640 --> 49:06.000
Well, I... I'd love to learn about
window dressing.

49:06.040 --> 49:09.640
Well, there you are, then. A bit of
an artist on the quiet, are you?

49:09.680 --> 49:13.360
I think you've got hidden depths.
No, I haven't.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.400
No. I've got a nose for these sort
of things.

49:17.560 --> 49:21.160
I think you are a bit special,
Agnus Towler.

49:30.040 --> 49:32.480
I should go.
Well, hang on a bit.

49:32.520 --> 49:35.200
Look. Have you seen the telephones
we got here?

49:37.200 --> 49:40.840
You can phone anybody you like on
the house.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.600
I don't know anybody with a
telephone.

49:44.640 --> 49:46.640
Come on, then.

49:47.400 --> 49:51.520
Let's have a dance instead.
No, I really have got to go.

49:51.560 --> 49:54.360
There's someone waiting for me.
Come on. Really.

49:58.440 --> 50:00.920
All right. Of course, Miss.

50:14.240 --> 50:16.800
Where were you? You're late! Who's
this?

50:16.840 --> 50:19.600
Victor Colleano. Pleased to meet
you. Take your hands off her!

50:19.640 --> 50:22.560
George, don't take on. Take on? I'll
give you take on!

50:22.600 --> 50:25.640
You need to learn some manners my
friend. I said, "Get off her!"

50:25.680 --> 50:27.160
George!

50:27.200 --> 50:29.800
Leave him. You can do better than
that. He's my brother.

50:29.840 --> 50:32.760
George. Calm down. What is it?

50:34.400 --> 50:37.320
He's found us, Agnes. He's tracked
us down.

50:43.400 --> 50:45.400
Come on.

51:18.800 --> 51:19.960
Oh, no!

51:50.400 --> 51:53.600
We didn't think there was an actual
fire, Chief but it's hard to tell.

51:53.640 --> 51:56.640
It is a very sophisticated system.
Sophisticated?!

51:56.680 --> 52:00.600
It has soaked every window in this
entire store

52:00.640 --> 52:02.400
for no reason whatsoever.

52:02.440 --> 52:05.320
Mr Selfridge. We have never
installed something so advanced.

52:05.360 --> 52:08.080
There are bound to be some teething
problems. No.

52:08.120 --> 52:11.200
No teething problems. Henri.
Mr Selfridge.

52:11.240 --> 52:13.120
Not now.

52:13.160 --> 52:15.160
Can it be fixed?

52:15.200 --> 52:17.200
Impossible.

52:21.120 --> 52:24.200
But we've done the impossible
before.

52:26.880 --> 52:29.600
Mr Selfridge, if the sprinklers go
off inside the store,

52:29.640 --> 52:32.080
the insurance company say they won't
cover us.

52:32.120 --> 52:34.120
They say the system's untested.

52:34.160 --> 52:36.400
It's all these innovations, Mr
Selfridge.

52:36.440 --> 52:38.440
I don't see how we can proceed.

52:41.960 --> 52:43.960
Miss Blenkinsop.

52:44.800 --> 52:48.440
Gather the staff. I want everyone
down here in 15 minutes.

52:48.480 --> 52:50.480
Apart from you, Crabb.

52:50.520 --> 52:53.920
Who will be on the telephone with
the insurance company

52:53.960 --> 52:55.960
doing your job.

52:56.720 --> 52:59.360
This store IS opening tomorrow.

53:08.425 --> 53:10.465
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

53:10.505 --> 53:12.745
Good morning, Mr Selfridge.

53:16.065 --> 53:18.265
They said we couldn't do it.

53:18.305 --> 53:20.745
Some are still saying we won't.

53:20.785 --> 53:23.185
Can't be done, they say.

53:23.225 --> 53:27.385
But we are going to prove them wrong.

53:33.505 --> 53:37.305
I want to tell you that I am proud
of each and every one of you,

53:37.345 --> 53:40.185
the way that you have risen
to this challenge.

53:40.225 --> 53:42.825
And today will be no exception.

53:43.745 --> 53:47.985
We may be here until midnight
working in a common cause,

53:48.025 --> 53:50.905
to create the finest
house of business

53:50.945 --> 53:54.945
that London, that the world
has ever seen!

54:00.625 --> 54:04.745
We are going to open on the day,
and on the dot of nine.

54:04.785 --> 54:07.745
So don't worry about whether
the fellow next to you is ready -

54:07.785 --> 54:10.105
make sure that you are!

54:10.145 --> 54:13.545
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are in this together.

54:14.425 --> 54:19.825
To work is elevating,
to accomplish is superb.

54:29.305 --> 54:31.665
All set?
Yes, Mr Selfridge.

54:31.705 --> 54:33.665
Very good. I like this.

54:33.705 --> 54:36.345
All set?
Yes, Mr Selfridge. Nice.

54:37.305 --> 54:39.305
All set for tomorrow?
Yes, Mr Selfridge.

54:39.345 --> 54:43.545
Very good, very good. This display is
just a little bit too neat and tidy.

54:43.585 --> 54:46.065
We don't want them to be afraid
to touch the goods.

54:46.105 --> 54:48.105
If I just pull one out like this,
you see?

54:48.145 --> 54:50.105
It's more of an invitation.

54:50.145 --> 54:52.185
Once they've got one of these
in their hands,

54:52.225 --> 54:54.425
they won't want to let 'em go.
Yes, Mr Selfridge.

54:54.465 --> 54:58.545
But otherwise, well done,
Miss Towler, well done.
I have high hopes for you.

54:59.745 --> 55:02.545
All set for tomorrow?
I think so, Mr Selfridge.

55:02.585 --> 55:06.905
You think so? Any doubt?
No, Mr Selfridge. All set here.

55:06.945 --> 55:08.745
That's what I like to hear.

55:08.785 --> 55:11.945
All set for tomorrow?
Good. Very good.

55:11.985 --> 55:14.305
All set? All set?

55:14.345 --> 55:17.745
Come on, Doris,
you should've finished that by now!

55:17.785 --> 55:21.625
The waist's too big! I shouldn't
be doing fashion anyway.
I'm Accessories.

55:21.665 --> 55:25.185
You need to stitch the back.
I'll run down to haberdashery.

55:25.225 --> 55:27.105
All set for tomorrow?

55:27.145 --> 55:29.025
Yes, sir. All done sir.

55:29.065 --> 55:32.785
Good work. Thank you, Mr Selfridge.
Thank you, sir.

55:35.665 --> 55:38.425
Do stop, Nancy,
you're shaking the floorboards!

55:56.505 --> 55:58.545
Oh, Nancy!

56:00.505 --> 56:02.225
Ellen!

56:04.025 --> 56:08.105
This, my dear,
is my ticket out of here.

56:50.585 --> 56:52.585
Night, Mr Selfridge.

57:40.425 --> 57:42.345
What's so fascinating out there?

57:42.385 --> 57:45.945
Would you believe
it's starting to snow!

57:46.985 --> 57:50.505
It looks like it's settling too,
of all the damn things!

57:50.545 --> 57:53.225
People won't let a little
bad weather put them off.

57:53.265 --> 57:55.865
Just when you think you've covered
every loophole.

57:55.905 --> 57:58.425
I dare say it'll all be gone
by the morning.

57:58.505 --> 58:00.825
Well, let's pray it is.

58:20.905 --> 58:25.825
Selfridges store
opens today! Read all about it!

59:04.225 --> 59:06.945
It's just wonderful, Harry.
Ain't it just?

59:26.665 --> 59:30.985
Congratulations, Harry! Absolutely
top-notch, the whole caboodle!

59:31.905 --> 59:34.105
Mr Selfridge!

59:34.145 --> 59:38.145
Musker and I are so pleased with
what you've done with our store.

59:38.185 --> 59:41.505
We've brought all our friends
to see just how clever you are.

59:41.545 --> 59:43.545
Why thank you, Lady Mae.

59:43.585 --> 59:46.945
Do encourage them to purchase
before they go.

59:53.265 --> 59:56.105
Mrs Selfridge? I'm Ellen Love.

59:56.145 --> 01:00:00.745
I expect Harry's told you
I'm the Spirit of Selfridge's!

01:00:00.785 --> 01:00:02.785
Congratulations.

01:00:02.825 --> 01:00:07.145
That must be quite a responsibility
for you, Miss Love.

01:00:08.265 --> 01:00:11.865
Well, who knew a shop
could be this glamorous?

01:00:12.985 --> 01:00:16.105
Is there no end to your
husband's talents? Ellen?

01:00:16.145 --> 01:00:18.625
Frank!
How good to see you.

01:00:18.665 --> 01:00:20.665
Isn't this wonderful?

01:00:55.105 --> 01:00:58.745
Great day, Crabb. Great day.

01:00:58.785 --> 01:01:03.145
As a spectacle, Mr Selfridge.
As a spectacle.

01:01:05.865 --> 01:01:08.065
Good night, Mr Crabb.

01:01:37.145 --> 01:01:39.265
We need to put on a show!

01:01:39.305 --> 01:01:42.065
These pictures they've taken of me.
They're just terrible!

01:01:42.105 --> 01:01:43.865
No! I cannot work like this!

01:01:43.905 --> 01:01:47.745
My studio's the other side
of Charing Cross Road. I'd love
to show you some of my work.

01:01:47.785 --> 01:01:49.425
It's all right, Kitty!

01:01:49.465 --> 01:01:51.105
What are you doing here?

01:01:51.145 --> 01:01:54.665
You're as much a daredevil
as that crazy Frenchman
trying to fly the Channel.

01:01:54.705 --> 01:01:57.065
Calais, Dover, Selfridges.
