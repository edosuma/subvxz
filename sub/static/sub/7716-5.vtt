It's genius!

00:09.499 --> 00:10.818
♪ I'm ♪

00:11.310 --> 00:14.053
I decided to prescreen all the
Halloween costumes this year.

00:14.172 --> 00:15.540
I've three simple rules.

00:15.628 --> 00:17.741
Don't be offensive,
don't be cliche,

00:17.822 --> 00:20.878
and don't take the first
two rules too seriously.

00:21.808 --> 00:24.996
The gorilla from Rise of
the Planet of the Apes.

00:25.868 --> 00:28.477
The one who sacrifices his life.

00:28.569 --> 00:30.435
Oh! Wow. Spoiler alert!

00:31.238 --> 00:32.771
It's been out for ages, man.

00:32.789 --> 00:34.957
Costume vetoed.

00:36.576 --> 00:38.978
Yeah...lt's, uh...

00:39.012 --> 00:40.212
Somebody's already called that.

00:40.247 --> 00:41.647
Who?

00:41.681 --> 00:43.482
Kevin has a gorilla suit
you could borrow.

00:43.517 --> 00:44.750
This is ridiculous.

00:44.785 --> 00:46.285
Why can't there just be
two Kate Middletons?

00:46.319 --> 00:47.753
Guys, I know.

00:47.787 --> 00:49.455
I mean, I wish
there could be too.

00:49.489 --> 00:52.124
It's like...I can't choose.

00:52.159 --> 00:54.026
They're both amazing,
it's just--

00:54.060 --> 00:56.562
look, I stayed up all night,
and I watched that GD wedding,

00:56.596 --> 00:57.696
and then I came to work

00:57.731 --> 00:58.964
and I made everyone else
watch it all day.

00:58.999 --> 00:59.965
Meredith wasn't even here.

00:59.983 --> 01:01.817
Because I was there.

01:01.852 --> 01:04.069
"You're the people's princess!

01:04.104 --> 01:06.038
Diana was nothing!"

01:06.072 --> 01:07.673
I thought you were
at your sister's funeral.

01:07.707 --> 01:11.210
What I said was, "my sister's
funeral is this weekend."

01:11.244 --> 01:12.545
Didn't say I'd be there.

01:12.579 --> 01:16.182
Why is it such a shock
that I follow the royal story?

01:16.216 --> 01:20.486
Warms my heart,
thinking about them two kids...

01:20.520 --> 01:22.154
Doin' it.

01:55.572 --> 01:56.539
There you go.

01:56.573 --> 01:59.325
There we go.
Thank you.

01:59.359 --> 02:00.793
When they talk about
all the nice things

02:00.827 --> 02:02.127
about dating a coworker,

02:02.162 --> 02:04.129
they don't mention
one of the best parts.

02:04.164 --> 02:06.966
After you're done dating,
you still get to work together

02:07.000 --> 02:10.068
every single day.

02:10.103 --> 02:12.371
Jim, put it on.

02:12.389 --> 02:14.056
Put it on, man.

02:14.090 --> 02:15.074
I don't know if I can.

02:15.108 --> 02:17.142
Come on.
The three amigos.

02:17.177 --> 02:19.395
- Three kings.
- All right.

02:19.429 --> 02:20.779
I know, I know, I know.

02:20.814 --> 02:22.398
But Darryl and Kevin
needed a third.

02:22.432 --> 02:24.733
They bought me this Jersey.
I said no.

02:24.768 --> 02:26.785
Kevin started crying, so...

02:26.820 --> 02:29.888
I am Chris Bosh.

02:29.906 --> 02:32.441
If you get into season one,
then you'll really--

02:32.492 --> 02:33.526
Oh, my God.

02:33.560 --> 02:35.727
What the hell
is wrong with you?

02:35.745 --> 02:37.062
It's called a costume.

02:37.097 --> 02:38.747
What are you, some kind of
Jamaican zombie woman?

02:38.782 --> 02:40.416
Ryan, will you please
tell her who I am?

02:40.450 --> 02:41.600
Whoopi Goldberg.

02:41.635 --> 02:43.636
Has no one here
heard of Kerrigan?

02:43.670 --> 02:45.504
From <i>Starcraft?</i>

02:45.539 --> 02:49.041
Queen of blades?

02:49.075 --> 02:50.409
It's all Toby's fault.

02:50.427 --> 02:52.244
Every Halloween,
I tell him the same thing.

02:52.262 --> 02:54.079
You can't bring weapons
into the office.

02:54.114 --> 02:56.415
And every year,
he says the same thing.

02:56.433 --> 02:59.518
"Soon as I get my weapons back,
I'm gonna kill you."

02:59.553 --> 03:02.855
But there I am at Thanksgiving,
alive, you know?

03:02.889 --> 03:05.291
I'm the lucky turkey.

03:08.428 --> 03:10.279
Everybody looking good?
This is--

03:10.313 --> 03:12.598
this is the best we can do?

03:12.616 --> 03:14.366
I'm not judging, I...
I think you guys look great.

03:14.401 --> 03:18.937
I just...Wanna make sure.
This is the best we can do?

03:18.955 --> 03:22.141
I just got a text
from Broccoli Rob--"boo!"

03:22.175 --> 03:23.909
It scared me.

03:23.944 --> 03:26.345
And then I got this text
from Robert California--

03:26.379 --> 03:27.646
"looking forward
to Halloween party.

03:27.681 --> 03:30.683
Expectations are high."

03:30.717 --> 03:33.185
Scared the [Bleep] out of me.

03:33.219 --> 03:34.970
Good day, pamaroo.

03:35.005 --> 03:36.338
Could you shoot
this off for me?

03:36.389 --> 03:38.807
- Yeah.
- Australian accent.

03:43.163 --> 03:44.630
What are you doing?

03:44.648 --> 03:46.015
Oh, I just wanted
to see how you do it.

03:46.066 --> 03:47.399
If you're doing
something I don't.

03:47.434 --> 03:49.568
Oh.

03:53.206 --> 03:54.690
- Are you--
- That Andy.

03:54.741 --> 03:56.358
So hot and cold.

03:56.409 --> 03:57.809
One day, he's like,
"fax these documents, please."

03:57.827 --> 04:00.029
Then the next, he's like,
"Pam, you fax them.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.280
Who cares
what Erin's feeling?"

04:01.314 --> 04:02.581
- Right?
- Oh, Erin.

04:02.616 --> 04:04.850
Pam, how would you rate me
as a receptionist

04:04.884 --> 04:06.001
on a scale of one to three?

04:06.036 --> 04:08.687
Um...Two?

04:08.722 --> 04:10.222
That's, like, the second
to last thing I wanted to hear.

04:10.256 --> 04:11.890
No, I mean, you're doing great.

04:11.925 --> 04:14.677
And Andy put you in charge
of the whole party, right?

04:14.711 --> 04:16.661
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

04:16.680 --> 04:19.231
Send completed.
You are the best in the biz.

04:19.265 --> 04:20.683
I can't deny.

04:20.716 --> 04:22.051
Bob and I are doing

04:22.101 --> 04:24.103
the Scranton
Haunted walking tour.

04:24.137 --> 04:26.004
I always wondered what kind
of people went on that thing.

04:26.022 --> 04:28.407
Oh, hey, if you go
by the Banshee Pub,

04:28.441 --> 04:31.610
tell the man in black
I say hello.

04:36.149 --> 04:37.716
What happened, Pam?

04:37.751 --> 04:40.452
Okay, when I was 22,
I worked there,

04:40.487 --> 04:42.020
and everybody said
the place was haunted.

04:42.038 --> 04:43.205
I didn't believe it,

04:43.239 --> 04:45.424
until one day,
before we opened,

04:45.458 --> 04:48.661
I look up into the mirror,
you know, behind the bar,

04:48.695 --> 04:53.298
and I see this old man
dressed all in black.

04:53.333 --> 04:56.602
But when I turn around,
there's no one there.

04:56.636 --> 04:58.904
- Oh!
- So I tell the cook my story--

04:58.938 --> 05:00.139
Wait, they have food there?

05:00.173 --> 05:03.842
And he said,
"that's what everyone sees.

05:03.877 --> 05:06.929
That's the man in black."

05:06.980 --> 05:08.230
No.

05:08.264 --> 05:11.517
My wife does not
believe in ghosts.

05:14.020 --> 05:15.454
Hey.
Hey.

05:15.488 --> 05:18.157
Oh, this "man in black" thing.

05:18.191 --> 05:19.224
What do you think
that was about?

05:19.259 --> 05:20.325
What do you mean?

05:20.360 --> 05:21.660
Was it, like,
trickery in the lights,

05:21.695 --> 05:22.895
or maybe you were
so primed to see it,

05:22.929 --> 05:25.280
then there it was.
I saw a ghost.

05:25.331 --> 05:27.733
Mm-hmm. No, but what
I'm saying is, like,

05:27.751 --> 05:29.785
- do you ever wonder what it was?
- It was a ghost.

05:29.836 --> 05:31.286
I told you this
on, like, our first date.

05:31.337 --> 05:33.005
Yeah, I had just
told you about the day

05:33.039 --> 05:35.541
that I met the blue angels.
I figured you had to top it.

05:35.575 --> 05:37.509
I don't know
what to tell you, Jim,

05:37.544 --> 05:41.046
but I saw a ghost.

05:45.218 --> 05:46.468
Hey!

05:46.519 --> 05:49.888
Uh-oh, looks like
we're under a Jack attack.

05:49.922 --> 05:51.457
Yes, Andrew.

05:51.491 --> 05:54.426
And you, on this day of fantasy,
are...A laborer.

05:56.780 --> 05:58.397
Yes.

05:58.431 --> 06:00.616
Everyone, this is Bert, my son.

06:00.650 --> 06:04.436
Bert, this is...
A paper company.

06:04.471 --> 06:05.604
Hey, Bert.

06:05.622 --> 06:07.289
Hello.

06:07.323 --> 06:10.442
Can I use a computer?
I need to check a hurricane.

06:10.460 --> 06:11.744
Here, use this one.

06:16.833 --> 06:19.651
Ah, look.
"Pin the wart on the witch."

06:19.686 --> 06:21.653
How did you know
I was bringing my son?

06:21.688 --> 06:23.555
Oh, I didn't.
It was for us.

06:23.590 --> 06:24.757
But he can play.

06:24.791 --> 06:26.692
Bertie-boy, would you like
to play this game?

06:26.726 --> 06:28.761
That stuff's for babies.

06:28.795 --> 06:30.429
Well, perhaps this party
will awaken the baby

06:30.463 --> 06:32.681
in all of us.

06:32.732 --> 06:34.966
Wow, who shot our grownup party

06:34.984 --> 06:37.202
with a kiddie ray gun?

06:37.237 --> 06:39.872
We're still getting it set up.
It's gonna be really cool.

06:43.409 --> 06:44.827
Extraordinary.

06:44.861 --> 06:46.545
Did you plan this?

06:46.579 --> 06:48.747
Well, Toby and I did, yeah.

06:48.782 --> 06:51.183
And I overheard, and thought,
"hey, that'd be fun.

06:51.217 --> 06:52.584
Don't mind if I do."

06:52.619 --> 06:55.921
If you turn out the lights,
we'll do a little dance.

06:55.955 --> 06:57.222
A-one, two, three!

06:57.257 --> 07:01.260
♪ dem bones, dem bones,
dem dry bones ♪

07:01.294 --> 07:04.129
♪ now we're the skeleton crew ♪

07:05.365 --> 07:07.349
Delightful.
Thank you.

07:07.383 --> 07:08.700
Now, then, how are we today?

07:08.735 --> 07:10.969
- Fine.
- Great.

07:11.004 --> 07:12.504
Just fine, Kelly?
Everything all right?

07:12.539 --> 07:13.806
- Mm-hmm.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.541
You feeling fulfilled
in your life?

07:15.575 --> 07:17.509
- I guess.
- You guess?

07:17.544 --> 07:21.814
So there is something you want
that you do not have.

07:21.848 --> 07:24.950
I try not to think about it.

07:24.984 --> 07:28.403
Because it's too terrifying
to imagine.

07:28.454 --> 07:30.122
Now we're cookin'.

07:30.156 --> 07:31.323
What is it, Kelly?

07:31.357 --> 07:34.526
What is
this great fear of yours?

07:34.561 --> 07:36.895
- Never marrying.
- Yes.

07:36.930 --> 07:41.767
Dying alone,
that is very scary.

07:41.801 --> 07:44.336
And how are you, Toby?

07:44.370 --> 07:47.272
So great.

07:50.076 --> 07:51.677
Oh, I put those up.

07:51.711 --> 07:53.211
I know.
I'm taking them down.

07:53.229 --> 07:58.934
I almost wonder if putting
nothing on this wall--

07:58.968 --> 08:01.086
This is more halloweeny.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.955
I don't know about this, guys.

08:02.989 --> 08:05.023
Andy put me in charge
of the Halloween party, so...

08:05.058 --> 08:08.226
Well, Andy sent us in here,
so which is it?

08:08.244 --> 08:09.227
Oh.

08:09.245 --> 08:10.529
So can we speak our minds now,

08:10.563 --> 08:13.031
or are we still
sparing feelings?

08:13.066 --> 08:15.133
Because I hate all of this.

08:17.403 --> 08:20.038
Very low pressure
in the Sargasso sea.

08:20.073 --> 08:23.775
Warm air from South America.
Cold air from Greenland.

08:23.810 --> 08:26.578
All signs point
to the perfect storm.

08:26.613 --> 08:28.297
Yeah, perfectly mediocre.

08:28.348 --> 08:29.815
What are you anyway?

08:29.849 --> 08:32.417
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman.
Leave me alone, ghoul.

08:32.452 --> 08:36.154
If you had some really big
wings with blades on the end,

08:36.188 --> 08:39.057
you'd kind of look like Kerrigan
from <i>Starcraft.</i>

08:39.092 --> 08:41.309
I am Kerrigan from <i>Starcraft,</i>
<i>I've been censored.</i>

08:41.361 --> 08:42.443
If you're gonna be a Zerg,

08:42.477 --> 08:44.830
at least be a lurker,
not some girl.

08:44.864 --> 08:47.265
Kerrigan is ruler
of the Zerg Swarm!

08:47.283 --> 08:48.934
Yeah, she also has boobs.

08:48.968 --> 08:52.704
Yeah, but no nipples.

08:52.739 --> 08:54.706
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:54.741 --> 08:56.675
What's up?

08:56.709 --> 08:58.627
November's sure creeping up,
ain't it?

08:58.661 --> 08:59.711
Can't stop that month.

08:59.746 --> 09:03.382
Oh, yeah.

09:03.416 --> 09:05.918
Hey, what's the jive
with Angela and Phyllis

09:05.952 --> 09:09.721
helping with the party,
you know?

09:09.756 --> 09:12.341
Um...I just thought
you could use some help.

09:12.392 --> 09:13.725
You know, 'cause Robert came in

09:13.760 --> 09:16.128
and thought the party
seemed a little kiddie,

09:16.162 --> 09:17.646
and I guess I agreed.

09:17.680 --> 09:22.534
And maybe we could mix
a little more 13 into the PG.

09:26.356 --> 09:27.940
- But that's it?
- Hmm?

09:27.974 --> 09:32.177
There's nothing about me,
or...I?

09:32.211 --> 09:34.913
Uh, can we talk about it
at the end of the day?

09:34.948 --> 09:38.350
I got a call.
Gotta make a call.

09:38.384 --> 09:41.153
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Yes, we can.

09:51.197 --> 09:52.497
Yes.

09:52.515 --> 09:55.017
I don't know.
Hmm?

09:57.670 --> 09:59.587
- Gabe.
- Sweetheart.

09:59.672 --> 10:00.856
I'm throwing
the Halloween party,

10:00.890 --> 10:02.541
and I just want
to amp it up a little.

10:02.575 --> 10:05.544
I think it could use
some...Extra pizzazz.

10:05.578 --> 10:07.562
Okay, where does
Gabe factor in?

10:07.613 --> 10:09.448
Remember that Halloween party
you took me to once?

10:09.482 --> 10:12.951
The one where I started crying
as soon as I walked in,

10:12.985 --> 10:14.519
and I didn't stop crying?

10:14.554 --> 10:16.721
Yes.
Lars and Takako's.

10:16.756 --> 10:18.723
Okay, well let's say
I wanted this party

10:18.758 --> 10:22.994
to be a tiny,
tiny bit like that one.

10:23.028 --> 10:28.300
Just more adult,
more scary and sexy.

10:28.334 --> 10:29.885
I will make this sexier
than you could ever imagine.

10:29.919 --> 10:31.219
No, just scary.

10:31.254 --> 10:34.306
If we wanted
ideas for scary stuff.

10:39.762 --> 10:41.546
Oh, that'd be scary.

10:41.564 --> 10:43.081
What are you thinking about?

10:43.115 --> 10:44.983
All right, let me go get it.

10:49.856 --> 10:51.055
Pam Halpert.

10:51.073 --> 10:53.024
Hey, it's Jim Halpert.

10:53.058 --> 10:54.726
I was wondering if you wanted
to see a movie tonight,

10:54.760 --> 10:56.828
'cause I've read a lot about
this really great documentary.

10:56.863 --> 10:58.597
Is it called <i>Ghostbusters?</i>

10:58.631 --> 11:01.116
- It's called <i>Ghostbusters.</i>
- Yeah.

11:01.167 --> 11:02.834
It didn't look like that.

11:02.869 --> 11:04.736
He didn't have
a Buster sign around him?

11:04.754 --> 11:07.122
Why don't you draw him?
Why don't we see this old man?

11:07.173 --> 11:09.040
Okay. Yeah. Fine.
I'll draw him.

11:09.074 --> 11:11.576
Okay.

11:11.594 --> 11:13.678
I ain't afraid of no ghosts.

11:15.481 --> 11:18.583
- Whoa.
- Mm-hmm.

11:18.618 --> 11:19.918
Dwight, are you eating a stick?

11:19.952 --> 11:23.488
- It's a root, idiot.
- Okay.

11:23.523 --> 11:25.257
Everyone hates you.

11:25.291 --> 11:26.808
That's really rude.

11:26.859 --> 11:29.094
I don't tell you hurricanes suck
even though it's true.

11:29.128 --> 11:30.529
What do you like, tornados?

11:30.563 --> 11:32.864
- Try influenza.
- Oh, yeah?

11:32.899 --> 11:35.033
What's the vaccine you could
take to avoid a hurricane?

11:35.067 --> 11:38.503
Open up a newspaper.
Oh, look, a hurricane's coming.

11:38.538 --> 11:41.272
Suppose you're gonna tell me
the scariest animal is a shark.

11:41.290 --> 11:45.176
Try a box jellyfish.

11:46.512 --> 11:48.713
What are we talking about?

11:48.748 --> 11:50.415
I was talking about my wife,
and how she believes in ghosts.

11:50.449 --> 11:51.800
And then we had
a little debate,

11:51.834 --> 11:54.119
and then Meredith said
that she believes in them too.

11:54.153 --> 11:56.788
You seem unimpressed.
Ghosts don't scare you?

11:56.822 --> 11:58.657
I'm only scared of real things,

11:58.691 --> 12:02.260
like serial killers
and kidnappers.

12:02.294 --> 12:06.197
Not things that don't exist,
like ghosts or mummies.

12:06.232 --> 12:07.832
Mummies are real.
There are mummies at museums.

12:07.867 --> 12:11.903
- Ha. Yeah.
You--

12:11.938 --> 12:13.238
- Prank.
- It's true.

12:13.272 --> 12:16.992
They've been preserved
for thousands of years,

12:17.026 --> 12:19.311
they're all over.

12:19.345 --> 12:25.350
Why on earth would a museum
put a mummy in it?

12:34.460 --> 12:36.695
I grew this party up real fast.

12:36.729 --> 12:38.346
Get out of here,
little kid party.

12:38.381 --> 12:39.664
Nobody loves you.

12:39.682 --> 12:41.600
And clean up your room.

12:41.634 --> 12:43.201
Grown-ups are gonna
use it later.

12:44.670 --> 12:46.638
Party looks fun, doesn't it?

12:46.672 --> 12:49.441
Everybody seems to be in there
having a great time.

12:49.475 --> 12:51.376
So maybe now
would be a great time

12:51.410 --> 12:52.677
for me to pop back
on the computer--

12:52.712 --> 12:54.045
I'm using it.

12:54.080 --> 12:57.682
I'm about to play
<i>Starcraft</i> with him.

12:57.700 --> 12:58.683
Are you serious?

12:58.701 --> 12:59.884
Yeah, I'm serious.

13:01.587 --> 13:04.222
It's funny.
Okay.

13:04.256 --> 13:05.924
- Loser.
- Yeah.

13:05.958 --> 13:07.892
Pam, do you think
anyone's gonna notice

13:07.927 --> 13:11.930
I've worn this costume before
when I wasn't pregnant?

13:11.964 --> 13:15.634
You know, I guess nobody
would believe it still fits.

13:15.668 --> 13:18.420
Hey, guys, I'm an Oscar...

13:18.471 --> 13:19.671
Liar...

13:19.705 --> 13:21.072
Weiner.

13:21.107 --> 13:22.273
Oh, my God.

13:22.308 --> 13:23.808
Party's tight, E.

13:23.843 --> 13:24.809
The fog is cool.

13:24.844 --> 13:26.227
Thanks.
It's on medium.

13:26.262 --> 13:27.846
Perfect.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.315
It really looks great.
You did a great job.

13:30.349 --> 13:33.084
Oh, so we don't
have to have that talk.

13:33.119 --> 13:34.903
We should still have that talk.

13:34.937 --> 13:36.921
Maybe you could come by
my office at, like, 4:45?

13:39.058 --> 13:41.059
Cool.

13:41.077 --> 13:42.494
Okay.

13:42.528 --> 13:46.230
Ahem.
Okay, everybody.

13:46.248 --> 13:50.235
Be prepared...
To be scared.

13:50.269 --> 13:53.621
Okay.
Okay.

14:10.422 --> 14:13.558
The cinema of the unsettling
is a growing film movement.

14:13.592 --> 14:15.126
The most well known
film in the genre

14:15.161 --> 14:20.365
is an hour long shot
of a squirrel with diarrhea.

14:28.674 --> 14:30.709
Is that my grandmother?

14:30.743 --> 14:32.994
- What's the story?
- There is no story.

14:33.045 --> 14:34.996
Yeah, seems like
there isn't a narrative.

14:35.047 --> 14:36.247
Maybe the filmmaker realized

14:36.281 --> 14:38.333
that even narrative
is comforting.

14:40.636 --> 14:42.137
What the hell is going on here?

14:42.171 --> 14:43.138
Okay, I think
we've seen enough,

14:43.172 --> 14:44.472
you--you can
turn it off now.

14:44.507 --> 14:46.141
Enough.

14:46.175 --> 14:48.960
Yeah, kill it. Go ahead and
turn it off. Thank you.

14:48.994 --> 14:50.145
How'd you get in my car?

14:50.179 --> 14:52.630
Where is this from?
That is so upsetting.

14:52.648 --> 14:55.299
That was awful.
Robert, I apologize.

14:55.317 --> 14:57.352
I'm sorry. I got confused.

14:57.403 --> 15:01.406
I heard that you wanted
to make the party more adult,

15:01.440 --> 15:03.575
but I think I know
what to do now.

15:03.609 --> 15:08.379
This game is called
pecker poker.

15:08.414 --> 15:11.533
It's the game of cards
that gets you har--

15:13.018 --> 15:16.838
What we have here
is a classic misunderstanding.

15:16.872 --> 15:19.958
Why didn't you simply
ask Andy to clarify?

15:19.992 --> 15:22.877
Asking is
a very easy thing to do.

15:22.928 --> 15:25.330
The two of you
are obviously very close.

15:30.703 --> 15:32.270
Oh, I see.

15:32.304 --> 15:35.473
This no longer seems
like my business.

15:38.744 --> 15:44.182
Um...All I knew is that you
wanted to have a talk with me

15:44.200 --> 15:46.517
at the end of the day,
and I got nervous, so...

15:46.535 --> 15:49.204
You were gonna talk
at the end of--

15:49.238 --> 15:51.055
I'm not here.

15:53.292 --> 15:56.527
Did you think
I was gonna fire you?

15:56.545 --> 16:00.365
No, I wasn't.

16:00.399 --> 16:02.584
I'm sorry, this must be
really uncomfortable for you.

16:02.635 --> 16:05.036
I'm never uncomfortable.

16:05.070 --> 16:07.105
Mm-kay.

16:07.139 --> 16:11.926
Erin, I think you know
I've been dating someone.

16:11.977 --> 16:13.228
Sure.

16:13.262 --> 16:16.598
And it's getting
a little more serious.

16:16.649 --> 16:18.116
She's never come by, so...

16:18.150 --> 16:20.385
Yeah, she's never called here.

16:20.419 --> 16:22.020
Unless it's your mom.

16:22.054 --> 16:23.721
No, I didn't want her to call

16:23.756 --> 16:26.357
'cause I thought
it would be weird, but...

16:26.392 --> 16:28.393
Now it's weird
that she's not calling.

16:28.427 --> 16:30.361
Two dates?

16:31.497 --> 16:33.598
Three dates?

16:33.632 --> 16:36.401
31.

16:36.435 --> 16:38.636
Wow.

16:38.671 --> 16:41.072
I'm so happy for you guys.

16:41.090 --> 16:44.342
Um, let me know
when you get to 40.

16:44.376 --> 16:46.427
I'll see you guys.

16:48.914 --> 16:50.348
I should go.

16:54.612 --> 16:56.426
I just don't give a *,

16:56.564 --> 16:58.231
I mean, you're
a rational person.

16:58.266 --> 17:00.167
Jim doesn't let me wash his
NFL Jersey during the playoffs,

17:00.201 --> 17:01.201
how is this any less logical?

17:01.235 --> 17:02.469
Careful. Whoa.

17:02.503 --> 17:04.037
First of all,

17:04.071 --> 17:06.356
it's not like I think that's
gonna help the Eagles win.

17:06.406 --> 17:07.491
- Really.
- No.

17:07.525 --> 17:08.942
That is just a bunch of people

17:08.976 --> 17:10.978
participating
in a collective thing

17:11.012 --> 17:12.362
that maybe the eagles
will hear about

17:12.413 --> 17:13.646
and wanna play better.
It's not--

17:13.665 --> 17:15.182
- Exactly.
- Thank you.

17:15.215 --> 17:16.532
Go. Get up there right now.

17:16.584 --> 17:17.951
- Got it.
- Dwight.

17:17.984 --> 17:20.186
You wanna attack, or let them
come to us. Your call, B.

17:20.221 --> 17:22.422
- Unleash the hell storm.
- Dwight.

17:22.457 --> 17:24.324
- Nice.
- Dwight!

17:24.342 --> 17:26.460
- Got him. Go!
- Yes!

17:26.493 --> 17:27.711
Is she Asian?

17:27.744 --> 17:31.431
I don't know.
She's from somewhere, I bet.

17:31.466 --> 17:33.634
- Maybe from the forest.
- Forest?

17:33.668 --> 17:35.552
Did Andy say his girlfriend's
from the forest?

17:35.603 --> 17:39.556
I don't know, Phyllis.
Maybe she's from the city.

17:44.145 --> 17:46.029
Looks terribly real,
doesn't it, creed?

17:46.064 --> 17:48.749
- No.
- Are you scared of snakes?

17:48.783 --> 17:50.417
You don't live
as long as I have

17:50.451 --> 17:54.087
without a healthy
fear of snakes, Bobby.

17:54.122 --> 17:56.390
Yeah, I guess sometimes
I have nightmares

17:56.424 --> 17:58.492
about being buried alive.

17:58.526 --> 18:00.410
Honestly?

18:00.461 --> 18:02.913
Jim gives me the creeps.

18:02.964 --> 18:05.632
What am I up to?

18:05.667 --> 18:07.334
Like, a few years
down the road,

18:07.368 --> 18:10.537
Cece says, "mom, there's
a ghost in my closet."

18:10.555 --> 18:11.755
Now you say one of two things.

18:11.806 --> 18:13.807
One-- You're just having
a bad dream,

18:13.841 --> 18:15.642
or two-- Let's go see
what it wants.

18:15.677 --> 18:17.477
I'm not gonna
freak her out, Jim.

18:17.512 --> 18:18.879
Okay.

18:18.913 --> 18:20.147
I'm not gonna
lie to her, either.

18:20.181 --> 18:21.381
Oh, come on!

18:21.416 --> 18:23.016
When I was a boy,

18:23.050 --> 18:25.602
there was an empty house

18:25.653 --> 18:28.271
just up the hill
from my family's.

18:28.322 --> 18:31.358
It was rumored a man
committed suicide there

18:31.392 --> 18:34.728
after being possessed
by the devil.

18:34.762 --> 18:37.698
One day, a young woman, Lydia,

18:37.732 --> 18:40.467
moved into the house
with her infant child.

18:40.501 --> 18:42.569
That very night,
Lydia was awakened

18:42.603 --> 18:47.574
by a loud, heinous
hissing sound.

18:49.010 --> 18:50.427
She walked to the nursery,

18:50.461 --> 18:53.797
and there
in baby's crib was a snake

18:53.848 --> 18:57.951
wrapped around baby's neck,
squeezing tighter and tighter.

18:57.985 --> 19:01.688
- Oh, my goodness.
- The crib was full of dirt.

19:01.723 --> 19:04.224
Baby struggled to free itself
from underneath,

19:04.258 --> 19:05.892
reaching and clawing,

19:05.926 --> 19:08.695
gasping for air.

19:08.730 --> 19:12.766
Embalmed bodies rose
from their sarcophagi,

19:12.784 --> 19:14.701
lurching toward baby...

19:17.271 --> 19:19.606
- For they were mummies.
- No!

19:19.640 --> 19:22.476
Amongst them, was a man.

19:22.510 --> 19:26.129
- Tall, slim...
- Jim.

19:26.164 --> 19:28.882
Almost instinctively,
she turned to her husband.

19:28.916 --> 19:32.619
"Oh, wait," she thought.

19:32.653 --> 19:35.338
"I don't have a husband."

19:35.389 --> 19:38.975
For Lydia and her husband
had had an argument,

19:39.010 --> 19:40.660
one they couldn't get past.

19:40.695 --> 19:43.897
Each night, they slept
one inch farther apart,

19:43.931 --> 19:45.999
until one night, Lydia left.

19:46.033 --> 19:48.001
It was about this time
she lost herself

19:48.035 --> 19:50.970
in imaginary worlds.

19:50.988 --> 19:53.440
She had quit the book club,
the choir,

19:53.474 --> 19:57.644
citing something about
their high expectations.

19:57.678 --> 20:00.313
Her lips slowly grew together
from disuse.

20:00.331 --> 20:03.116
Every time she wanted
to act and didn't,

20:03.150 --> 20:06.453
another part of her face
hardened until it was stone.

20:06.487 --> 20:10.223
And that fevered night,
she rushed to the nursery,

20:10.258 --> 20:14.928
and threw open the door.
"Baby, are you okay?"

20:14.962 --> 20:18.698
Baby sat up slowly,

20:18.733 --> 20:23.870
turned to mother, and said...

20:23.905 --> 20:27.407
"I'm fine, bitch.

20:27.441 --> 20:31.845
I'm fine."

20:37.451 --> 20:40.954
Fear plays an interesting
role in our lives.

20:40.988 --> 20:45.292
How dare we let it motivate us?

20:45.326 --> 20:47.794
How dare we let it
into our decision-making,

20:47.829 --> 20:51.665
into our livelihoods,
into our relationships?

20:51.699 --> 20:52.833
It's funny, isn't it,

18:33.767 --> 18:35.934
we take a day a year
to dress up in costume

18:35.952 --> 18:38.437
and celebrate fear?

20:59.373 --> 21:01.041
- Toby?
- Oh, hey, Bert.

21:01.075 --> 21:02.959
Wanna see the dance?

21:02.994 --> 21:06.296
- ? dem bones, dem bones, dem-- ?
- You're fired.
