- York City.

I feel our business there
shouldn't wait till February.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.010
Sit, have a sherry
with me.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.912
Uh, no, I'd rather
just get on the road

05:13.914 --> 05:15.881
while there's still
a chance of making
the city by nightfall.

05:15.883 --> 05:20.419
- Nightfall with the hogs?
- No hogs, no wagon, just me.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.054
This is a seller's trip.

05:24.424 --> 05:26.491
What I need from you
is a letter from Colonel Cook

05:26.493 --> 05:28.560
to get me
past the checkpoints.

05:28.562 --> 05:32.064
Abraham, no one is conducting
business over the holiday.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.802
Which leaves us
with no competition.

05:36.804 --> 05:39.037
See, all the fighting
has stopped for the winter,

05:39.039 --> 05:42.741
so Howe's entire army
is bunkered down in the city.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.476
Just think of the demand
that this creates.

05:44.478 --> 05:47.346
Now is the time to
renegotiate our contract.

05:47.348 --> 05:51.550
Alas, we've struck
a gentlemen's deal with Cook.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.952
<i>You want me</i>
<i>to give you his letter</i>

05:53.954 --> 05:56.355
so you can sell
to somebody else?

05:56.357 --> 05:58.023
<i>The army has needs.</i>

05:58.025 --> 06:00.525
The city's population
will have tripled.

06:02.829 --> 06:05.697
Why are you so anxious
to go to New York?

06:07.834 --> 06:10.769
Don't you want to celebrate
Christmas with your family,

06:10.771 --> 06:12.070
with your wife and child?

06:12.072 --> 06:15.941
Of course I do,
but, uh...

06:15.943 --> 06:17.776
I must provide
for them first.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.678
Well, if it's
a question of a loan...

06:19.680 --> 06:21.913
- No.
- <i>...to get you</i>
<i> through the winter.</i>

06:21.915 --> 06:23.615
- I don't want--
- <i>Mary doesn't have to know.</i>

06:23.617 --> 06:25.784
I want nothing from you.

06:29.622 --> 06:31.723
I had noticed
you'd been avoiding me

06:31.725 --> 06:34.459
since the fortification
of the barracks.

06:34.461 --> 06:36.595
"The fortification."

06:37.730 --> 06:39.965
Is that truly
what you're calling it?

06:39.967 --> 06:42.934
I call it my duty
and I would do it again.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.971
Well, good.
You still have your wife's
gravestone to tear out.

06:55.615 --> 06:59.418
She would know
you didn't mean that.

06:59.420 --> 07:02.754
Just the same as you
saying you want nothing
from me is untrue.

07:04.056 --> 07:08.794
You want my pass to the city
and I do not grant it

07:08.796 --> 07:12.731
<i>because I know that you</i>
<i>running from your home,</i>

07:12.733 --> 07:16.168
from our family,
will not bring you peace.

07:20.673 --> 07:23.608
I will be
celebrating Christmas
at my house this year,

07:23.610 --> 07:26.545
with my family.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.180
Don't expect us.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.570
<i>( soldier shouting orders )</i>

08:27.840 --> 08:30.575
Anna:
<i>Please understand,</i>
<i>I'm not here to dispute</i>

08:30.577 --> 08:33.544
<i>the attainder</i>
<i>against my husband</i>
<i>or his estate.</i>

08:33.547 --> 08:36.014
It is the military
provision within it,

08:36.015 --> 08:37.816
this Dunmore Proclamation,

08:37.818 --> 08:40.184
that forms the basis
of my complaint.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.220
Please do tell us

08:42.222 --> 08:44.656
what fault you find
with Lord Dunmore.

08:45.558 --> 08:48.093
Not with
the man himself.

08:49.829 --> 08:52.163
It's just--

08:52.165 --> 08:54.666
it's cruel,

08:54.668 --> 08:58.270
this business
of freeing slaves
of suspected Patriots.

08:58.272 --> 09:00.839
I am sincerely sorry

09:00.841 --> 09:02.941
that you're being punished
for your husband's actions,

09:02.943 --> 09:06.878
but he is a confirmed
insurrectionist, madam,
not a suspected one.

09:08.581 --> 09:11.750
These poor souls
have never had to provide
for themselves.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.586
And now you give them
a mere seven days

09:14.588 --> 09:16.221
to prepare for a life
they have never known.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.224
Were their forefathers
given a chance to prepare

09:19.226 --> 09:21.593
when they were plucked
from the Dark Continent

09:21.595 --> 09:23.328
and introduced
to these shores?

09:24.864 --> 09:28.867
Sir, I have known
some of them all
my life and--

09:28.869 --> 09:30.735
Slavery is a sin,

09:30.737 --> 09:33.805
<i>which is why it</i>
<i>has just been legally</i>
<i>abolished in England</i>

09:33.807 --> 09:36.341
and, I expect,
soon throughout
the Crown Colonies.

09:36.343 --> 09:40.178
<i>The Dunmore Proclamation</i>
<i>will be upheld.</i>

09:41.781 --> 09:44.349
The able men
will go to New York
and join the war effort,

09:44.351 --> 09:46.952
<i>and as for the women,</i>
<i>I've already arranged</i>

09:46.954 --> 09:49.287
a perfect opportunity

09:49.289 --> 09:50.789
It's, uh--

09:50.791 --> 09:54.192
uh, Abigail, is it?

09:55.895 --> 09:59.030
All right.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.075
It was your father's.

10:13.079 --> 10:15.914
He'd have been so proud
that you can read.

10:15.916 --> 10:18.249

10:26.793 --> 10:30.061
You smell
that balangu, huh?

10:30.063 --> 10:32.263
You best hurry before
the whole thing gone.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.032
Go on.

10:36.002 --> 10:38.903
How often must I tell you
not to push into my place?

10:38.905 --> 10:43.174
You only got about seven days
to see what you're missing.

10:43.176 --> 10:46.311
Once New Year come,
I get them papers, I gone.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.913
Then I wish you
safe passage.

10:50.816 --> 10:53.151
Maybe you're not ready
to walk free in this world.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.654
( scoffs )
'Cause I won't
lay down with you?

10:55.656 --> 10:59.057
That's a different
kind of walk.

10:59.059 --> 11:02.293
City walk.
Eyes forward,
not to the ground.

11:02.295 --> 11:05.196
Oh, you know that walk?

11:05.198 --> 11:07.732
I was born free.

11:07.734 --> 11:10.435
Then walk free
with one of your gals.

11:12.371 --> 11:14.673
They ain't important.

11:15.741 --> 11:17.442
Not like you.

11:17.444 --> 11:20.178
Abigail:
<i>Why am I so important</i>
<i>all of a sudden?</i>

11:20.180 --> 11:23.114
Well, you can read,
can't you?

11:24.917 --> 11:27.118
Jordan:
<i>Don't be afraid, Abby.</i>

11:27.120 --> 11:29.821
I know your secret
since way back.

11:33.392 --> 11:37.862
Look, if you treat me right,
maybe I'll stick with ya.

11:38.931 --> 11:41.700
I'll protect
you and your boy.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.468
You gonna need
a strong man.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.737
My son is all I need.

11:50.009 --> 11:52.444
You think
you better than me?

11:52.446 --> 11:56.214
- I never said--
- Gals like you,
always cold.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.982
But watch.

11:57.984 --> 12:01.252
You gon' end
with nothing.

12:10.262 --> 12:11.996
Soldier: <i>Major Rogers</i>
<i>has come to wish you</i>

12:11.998 --> 12:13.431
<i>a happy</i>
<i>Christmastide, sir.</i>

12:13.433 --> 12:16.267
Lieutenant-Colonel
Commandant is his title.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.036
He hasn't been Major Rogers

12:18.038 --> 12:20.405
since he fought the French
and their native allies.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.774
Ah, so this is
where your commander

12:22.776 --> 12:24.909
keeps all
his favorite boys.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.277
<i>Not bad, Johnny.</i>

12:26.279 --> 12:28.179
Did you follow me here?

12:28.181 --> 12:31.216
It wasn't hard to track ya.
Us Rangers always get our man.

12:31.218 --> 12:34.753
Oh, so you found
that dragoon you've been
hunting at long last?

12:34.755 --> 12:37.122
<i>Oh, no, I recall.</i>

12:37.124 --> 12:39.290
You came back
from Long Island
empty-handed.

12:39.292 --> 12:42.260
And the bird sings to me
that you came back
from New Jersey

12:42.262 --> 12:45.163
<i>with a captured</i>
<i>general in tow.</i>

12:45.165 --> 12:48.133
I should wish
to talk with your prize.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.834
Where is he?

12:53.439 --> 12:57.041
The birds tell me
your Rangers have been
foraging for purpose,

12:57.043 --> 13:01.212
offering to take
any task for any sum.

13:02.214 --> 13:04.082
For the Crown.

13:04.084 --> 13:07.051
Just because you lot
plan to slumber all winter

13:07.053 --> 13:08.953
doesn't mean Georgie does.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.789
Have you intelligence
to share?

13:10.791 --> 13:13.191
I have experience.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.527
Georgie fought
alongside me in the wild,

13:15.529 --> 13:19.531
not in the dainty fields
of Europe where rules matter.

13:19.533 --> 13:23.234
Still, when the bounties
of his men expire next week,

13:23.236 --> 13:26.471
he shall be short
precisely one army,

13:26.473 --> 13:31.476
and General Howe
will no longer have use
for the hounds of war.

13:35.581 --> 13:38.349
Tell me, Robert,
what do you intend to do

13:38.351 --> 13:40.919
when this war
is officially over?

13:40.921 --> 13:43.488
Return to settle
your estate?

13:43.490 --> 13:45.290
Your debts?

13:48.394 --> 13:52.030
Apologies, sir.
Your presence is
requested by General--

13:56.235 --> 14:00.004
Oh, I aim to settle
all accounts, boy.

14:02.408 --> 14:06.477
Frederick, please show
my guest out.

14:06.479 --> 14:07.979
Frederick:
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

14:07.981 --> 14:11.015
Happy New Year, Major.

14:13.118 --> 14:14.919
To peace!

14:19.525 --> 14:21.459
Major:
<i>Tallmadge,</i>
<i>on your feet.</i>

14:21.461 --> 14:22.861
Sir.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.529
Muster out and collect
your supplies.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.098
Every man gets three
days' cooked rations,

14:27.100 --> 14:29.434
40 rounds of ammunition,
fresh flints, and a blanket.

14:29.436 --> 14:32.403
- For what, sir?
- Secret mission, they say.

14:32.405 --> 14:35.073
Password challenge
is "victory."

14:35.075 --> 14:37.242
And the answer, sir?

14:37.244 --> 14:39.077
"Or death."

14:53.926 --> 14:57.195
- Caleb!
- What?

14:57.197 --> 14:59.030
You know what this
is all about?

14:59.032 --> 15:02.166
Me? No.
Thought you would.

15:02.168 --> 15:05.503
All they told me
is we're crossing
the Delaware.

15:05.505 --> 15:08.139
Great.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.208
They told us
just to follow you.

15:10.210 --> 15:13.044
<i>Huh?</i>

15:15.614 --> 15:18.983
Well, you're the whaler.

15:18.985 --> 15:22.186
As long as we're
crossing, he's captain.

15:22.188 --> 15:23.554
That's me.

15:23.556 --> 15:28.626
So, you, you, and you
grab the push-poles.

15:28.628 --> 15:31.229
Right, push off!

15:33.632 --> 15:35.967
( boat creaking )

15:43.509 --> 15:46.644
Caleb:
I mean, you ask me, this is
just a glorified scout.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.681
Secret password,
"Victory or death."

15:49.683 --> 15:52.016
No, Washington's
just trying to make us

15:52.018 --> 15:54.285
feel like we're
still in the fight.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.688
Caleb, look.

16:03.495 --> 16:05.296
Jesus.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.299
This is no scout.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.724
I'm sorry.

16:32.726 --> 16:34.292
I was being silly.

16:34.294 --> 16:37.128
No.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.997
Do you like it?

16:38.999 --> 16:42.000
It's beautiful.

16:42.002 --> 16:43.701
It's yours.

16:43.703 --> 16:47.472
- I insist.
- ( laughs ) I couldn't--

16:47.474 --> 16:51.175
Please, take it.

16:56.648 --> 17:00.051
I know how impossible
this all must be for you.

17:00.053 --> 17:03.087
I want you to know
that I am here

17:03.089 --> 17:05.256
and I will continue
working for you in
this difficult time...

17:05.258 --> 17:06.790
- Abigail...
- ...for whatever
you can pay.

17:06.792 --> 17:09.127
we will survive this.

17:10.396 --> 17:12.096
Even when I'm free,
we shall still be friends.

17:12.098 --> 17:13.598
You're not going
to be free.

17:15.401 --> 17:18.336
Major Hewlett is hell-bent
on making a gift of you

17:18.338 --> 17:20.438
to a British officer
in New York.

17:22.374 --> 17:26.044
I am horrified
by this decision.

17:26.046 --> 17:30.381
<i>I protested</i>
<i>as vigorously</i>
<i>as I could.</i>

17:30.383 --> 17:34.185
<i>But my possessions</i>
<i>and any say I might</i>
<i>have had are gone.</i>

17:34.187 --> 17:35.586
I'm as powerless
in this as you.

17:35.588 --> 17:39.123
No, your possessions
are being taken.

17:39.125 --> 17:41.325
You yourself are not.

17:41.327 --> 17:44.262
I don't know what to do.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.797
Tell me what to do.

17:48.333 --> 17:50.501
Don't let them
do this to me.

17:50.503 --> 17:53.738
- I pleaded with them, Abby.
- Plead with them again.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.674
Annie, please.
I'm begging you.

17:57.709 --> 18:00.378
If I must go to New York,
I will go.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.380
But let my son
come with me.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.482
He can work.
He can earn his keep.

18:04.484 --> 18:08.086
I asked, Abby.
I begged.

18:10.189 --> 18:11.756
I'm so sorry.

18:14.393 --> 18:17.695
( sobbing )

18:30.142 --> 18:31.809
( whispering )
Anna.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.215
Anna!

18:43.355 --> 18:46.324
- Anna, wait! I need to talk to
you. I need to talk to you.
- No!

18:46.326 --> 18:48.726
- ( sobbing )
- What's happened?

18:48.728 --> 18:51.796
- They're taking
everything.
- What?

18:51.798 --> 18:54.599
Everything.
( continues sobbing )

18:55.701 --> 18:58.870
- Is it the attainder?
- ( sniffles )

18:58.872 --> 19:00.438
From my father?

19:03.275 --> 19:06.310
Look, we shouldn't
waste any more time.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.546
I need you
to do something for me.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.448
I need you to hang
a black petticoat.

19:11.583 --> 19:12.917
Why?

19:14.753 --> 19:17.321
The British are recalling one
of their most important men,

19:17.323 --> 19:19.490
General Cornwallis,
back to London.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.860
Look, I copied this straight
from Hewlett's correspondence.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.163
We need to get it to Caleb
and then straight on to Ben.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.631
It's too late.

19:26.633 --> 19:29.634
- Listen, Anna--
- It's over.

19:31.537 --> 19:34.305
Washington's finished,
everyone says so.

19:34.307 --> 19:36.641
That's why Cornwallis
is leaving

19:36.643 --> 19:39.210
and why this intelligence,
as you call it,

19:39.212 --> 19:41.345
can be gotten
in any local gazette.

19:42.714 --> 19:45.750
- Anna.
- Now, go before
somebody sees you.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.585
Anna, wait.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.854
You once said to me,
"What are you waiting for?"

19:49.856 --> 19:51.856
Well, I'm here.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.958
I'm trying to fight back.
I'm trying to change things.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.594
Things have changed, Abe.

20:01.767 --> 20:04.635
It's time for me
to leave this place.

20:04.637 --> 20:08.272
No, you can't go.

20:08.274 --> 20:10.274
What's left here for me?

20:14.913 --> 20:17.415
You have a family,

20:17.417 --> 20:20.785
a wife and a child.

20:21.687 --> 20:24.422
I have a husband
in prison.

20:26.525 --> 20:28.492
There's nothing you

20:28.494 --> 20:31.429
or Ben Tallmadge
can do about that.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.898
Anna.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.607
What is it you--
you sailors say?

20:42.609 --> 20:44.976
"Fair weather
brings cloudy weather"?

20:44.978 --> 20:46.877
Maybe this time
it'll be the reverse.

20:46.879 --> 20:50.781
Or maybe the fog
will lift and there'll
just be more fog.

20:52.351 --> 20:53.718
We're here.

20:53.720 --> 20:57.321
All right,
on your feet, men.

20:57.323 --> 20:59.590
<i>Everyone,</i>
<i>check your flints.</i>

21:01.660 --> 21:04.662
Move back,
you're tipping her.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.297
Watch those arms.
Grab that swivel gun!

21:06.299 --> 21:08.666
Ben, no!
Ben!

21:14.640 --> 21:16.607
Pull him!

21:21.046 --> 21:23.914
All right? Hey, wake up!

21:23.916 --> 21:26.884
How's that fire coming on?
Come here, you.

21:28.453 --> 21:30.421
You're not going on me
like this, you dumb bastard.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.556
You hear me?
You stay awake, all right?

21:32.558 --> 21:34.525
( echoing )
Come on!

21:34.527 --> 21:36.594
You look at me!

21:36.596 --> 21:38.796
Caleb:
<i>Know why you can't die?</i>

21:38.798 --> 21:40.464
<i>You're still a virgin.</i>

21:40.466 --> 21:44.001
See, all you ever done
is box the Jesuit.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.604
I'm surprised
you're not blind.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.639
Now, the man upstairs,
He don't take kindly

21:48.641 --> 21:50.841
to virgins
over the age of 20.

21:50.843 --> 21:53.477
Sees it as a waste
of His good works.

21:57.549 --> 21:59.850
( coughing )

21:59.852 --> 22:01.519
<i>( Caleb urinating )</i>

22:01.521 --> 22:05.389
Hey, Happy New Year,
Tall-boy.

22:07.859 --> 22:09.794
How do you feel?

22:09.796 --> 22:12.596
( groans )

22:14.700 --> 22:17.702
Where are the--
where are the men?

22:17.704 --> 22:21.005
Right now? Gone.

22:22.774 --> 22:25.543
- Gone?
-  <i>Yeah.</i>

22:25.545 --> 22:27.778
You've been out
for a few days, my friend.

22:27.780 --> 22:30.948
- What?
- The year's over.

22:32.784 --> 22:34.385
Bounties are up.

22:36.688 --> 22:39.357
I doubt too many
are keen to reenlist.

22:39.359 --> 22:40.958
Where were they headed?

22:43.362 --> 22:47.098
Uh, Trenton.

22:47.100 --> 22:50.134
Trenton?

22:56.408 --> 22:58.442
- <i>( bottles shatter ) </i>
<i>- Shite!</i>

22:58.444 --> 23:01.579
Hey, now,
that's on you, not us.

23:01.581 --> 23:04.048
It wasn't my fault.
The ox moved the cart.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.917
You don't look like an ox.
Clean it up.

23:17.062 --> 23:19.930
<i>( Philomena laughing )</i>

23:34.579 --> 23:36.580
I'll show you, Lethario.

23:36.582 --> 23:39.550
- ( chuckles )
-  <i>( door opens )</i>

23:40.719 --> 23:42.753
Who are you?
Identify yourself.

23:42.755 --> 23:45.589
I demand
to know the meaning
of this intrusion.

23:46.958 --> 23:48.993
Charles?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.430
Robert Rogers.

23:54.065 --> 23:56.700
- Robert Rogers?
- In the flesh.

23:56.702 --> 23:58.436
( both laugh )

23:58.438 --> 24:00.504
I haven't seen you
since the disaster
of Carillon.

24:00.506 --> 24:02.773
- Oh!
- ( both laughing )

24:04.743 --> 24:08.512
My apologies, I trust
that John told you that
I'd be joining you, yes?

24:08.514 --> 24:10.948
Ah, Miss Endicott,

24:10.950 --> 24:12.983
you are in the presence

24:12.985 --> 24:16.487
of a true hero
of the Seven Years' War.

24:16.489 --> 24:19.557
The Indians named him
"White Devil."

24:19.559 --> 24:20.724
( chuckles )

24:20.726 --> 24:22.626
Boiling water,
terrible temper.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.128
- Oh.
- Nah.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.830
It's a pleasure,
Miss Endicott.

24:25.832 --> 24:28.966
Major Andre was called
away by Lord Cornwallis.

24:30.168 --> 24:32.603
Yes, that's
an unfortunate business.

24:32.605 --> 24:35.206
He requested that I ask
the good general here...

24:35.208 --> 24:38.042
- ( grunts )
- ...a few questions
in his absence.

24:38.044 --> 24:40.511
It's a mere formality.
This any good?

24:40.513 --> 24:42.780
Oh, very good.
Let me get you a chair.

24:45.050 --> 24:47.017
Abe:
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

24:48.086 --> 24:51.522
- Hey, Mr. Baker.
- Oh, Mr. Woodhull.

24:52.791 --> 24:54.158
What's all this?

24:54.160 --> 24:57.495
Oh, just helping
Mrs. Woodhull.

25:05.971 --> 25:08.672
- <i>( door opens ) </i>
<i>- Abe:</i> <i>Mary?</i>

25:10.809 --> 25:12.776
Shh.

25:12.778 --> 25:14.645
( quietly )
Where are you going?

25:14.647 --> 25:17.615
I'm going to your father's
for the Feast of the Epiphany.

25:17.617 --> 25:19.683
No, no, we're not.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.519
- Abraham...
- Mary, we spoke about this.

25:21.521 --> 25:24.121
I've spoken to him.
We are not going.

25:25.624 --> 25:27.992
Thomas is sick.

25:29.227 --> 25:30.961
What?

25:30.963 --> 25:32.997
He has the croup.

25:32.999 --> 25:35.299
<i>( Thomas coughs )</i>

25:35.301 --> 25:38.168
Oh, Sprout.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.870
Who told you that?

25:39.872 --> 25:41.872
Dr. Mabbs.

25:41.874 --> 25:44.074
He was just here.

25:44.076 --> 25:46.944
He recommended
inhaled steam twice daily

25:46.946 --> 25:49.680
<i>and a warm environment</i>
<i>for the rest of the winter.</i>

25:49.682 --> 25:53.784
Whitehall has
a hearth in every room
and excellent servants.

25:53.786 --> 25:56.153
I can keep a fire
burning here night
and day.

25:56.155 --> 25:58.088
My own brother
died of this.

25:58.090 --> 26:00.824
I won't risk our son's life.

26:11.870 --> 26:14.204
Well, you'll have
to keep him bundled,
then, all right?

26:14.206 --> 26:16.006
There's a chill out there.

26:17.275 --> 26:19.076
- Come with us.
- I can't.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.011
This is a time
to be with family.

26:21.013 --> 26:23.080
- Mary, I can't see him.
- I--

26:23.082 --> 26:26.150
I know that you're
upset with your father,
but think of his pain.

26:26.152 --> 26:29.019
He made a terrible sacrifice
for the good of the town.

26:29.021 --> 26:30.921
Sacrifice?
The man debased himself

26:30.923 --> 26:32.356
in front of God
and the entire town.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.124
I'm not ready
to forgive him that

26:34.126 --> 26:36.260
and I'm certainly
not ready to share
his table.

26:36.262 --> 26:39.663
<i>( Thomas crying )</i>

26:42.367 --> 26:44.101
Just go.

26:45.637 --> 26:47.638
Go before
I change my mind.

26:52.644 --> 26:56.780
- <i>( Thomas coughing ) </i>
<i>-</i> <i>( horse whickers )</i>

27:10.895 --> 27:12.630
Hewlett:
As you may have heard,

27:12.632 --> 27:15.065
you are being sent
to New York

27:15.067 --> 27:18.669
to join the war effort.

27:18.671 --> 27:22.072
There you will be assigned
to the Black Pioneers

27:22.074 --> 27:24.408
and serve under
Captain George Martin.

27:24.410 --> 27:26.910
<i>At the end of your tours,</i>

27:26.912 --> 27:28.946
if you have
served diligently,

27:28.948 --> 27:32.216
you will receive
these signed papers

27:32.218 --> 27:35.252
attesting to your freedom.

27:35.254 --> 27:38.022
<i>Take heed.</i>

27:38.024 --> 27:41.659
If you try
to desert your ranks
or flee your duty,

27:41.661 --> 27:46.130
your freedom
will be rescinded
permanently.

27:55.140 --> 27:57.408
Don't take God out
of your thoughts...

27:57.410 --> 28:00.844
( quietly )
...or let anyone
know you can read.

28:01.846 --> 28:04.314
Yes'm.

28:04.316 --> 28:06.417
- Mama, please.
- Hush, now.

28:07.252 --> 28:09.286
Baby.

28:09.288 --> 28:11.689
Go on, now.
Go.

28:17.896 --> 28:21.398
Aberdeen will take
good care of him.

28:21.400 --> 28:24.168
I want you to.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.136
That's not possible.

28:27.772 --> 28:30.774
I know what
you've been doing
with the laundry.

28:33.778 --> 28:36.480
You hang petticoats
to summon the Brewster boy.

28:36.482 --> 28:39.850
The one who's fighting
for the rebel side.

28:39.852 --> 28:42.720
I saw you in the barn
that night--

28:42.722 --> 28:45.055
you, Mr. Caleb,
and Mr. Abe

28:45.057 --> 28:47.991
all together like when
you were children.

28:47.993 --> 28:50.894
But what you're doing
is no childish thing.

28:52.497 --> 28:55.032
- Abigail, listen.
- They say...

28:55.034 --> 28:58.001
I'm to work for
a Major John Andre.

28:59.270 --> 29:02.005
I will cook, clean,

29:02.007 --> 29:04.441
come to know his secrets
like no other.

29:06.010 --> 29:08.345
Protect my boy
in Setauket...

29:09.447 --> 29:13.350
and I will do
your laundry in New York.

29:15.386 --> 29:17.087
Do you agree?

29:17.922 --> 29:20.157
Soldier:
<i>Hurry up now.</i>

29:23.261 --> 29:25.295
Nod if you agree.

29:33.338 --> 29:38.408
â™ª Here's to thee
old apple tree â™ª

29:38.410 --> 29:41.245
â™ª Hats full, caps full

29:41.247 --> 29:42.813
Huzzah!

29:42.815 --> 29:45.082
â™ª Good bushel sacks full

29:45.084 --> 29:48.519
â™ª My pockets, too

29:48.521 --> 29:51.121
Come on, boys.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.490
Drink up, now. Come on.
Come on, boys.

29:55.426 --> 29:59.797
â™ª Hats full, caps full

29:59.799 --> 30:02.466
â™ª Bushel sacks full

30:02.468 --> 30:06.036
â™ª Hats full, caps full...

30:06.038 --> 30:08.071
<i>( knock on door )</i>

30:32.363 --> 30:34.131
Can I come in?

30:37.502 --> 30:39.403
It's freezing out here.

30:41.072 --> 30:42.439
Yeah,

30:53.551 --> 30:55.452
What's that?

30:57.021 --> 30:59.623
Silverware.

30:59.625 --> 31:03.126
I'd rather you have it
than Hewlett or your father.

31:06.331 --> 31:09.299
Mary will appreciate
the quality, I'm sure.
Where is she?

31:09.301 --> 31:12.269
Uh, she's gone.
So's Thomas.

31:12.271 --> 31:14.605
They're both
at my father's house.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.476
Oh.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.144
I see.

31:33.658 --> 31:35.559
I've never been
inside your home.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.928
( chuckles )

31:37.930 --> 31:40.564
Well, of course
you haven't.

31:40.566 --> 31:43.233
That'd be forbidden,
wouldn't it?

31:45.236 --> 31:48.372
Abraham,
what has happened?

31:48.374 --> 31:52.309
Doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.

31:52.311 --> 31:55.312
Nothing matters,
actually,

31:55.314 --> 31:58.582
when we take the measure
of things, as we're meant
to do at the New Year.

31:58.584 --> 32:01.952
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>let's make a toast.</i>

32:01.954 --> 32:04.354
- <i>( liquid pouring ) </i>
<i>- To the year ahead.</i>

32:04.356 --> 32:05.956
To 1777.

32:07.091 --> 32:09.059
How much
have you been drinking?

32:09.061 --> 32:11.561
Mm, just a little bit.
Here, have some.

32:11.563 --> 32:13.530
I've come
for another reason.

32:15.466 --> 32:17.234
What would that be?

32:19.103 --> 32:20.971
It's about our signal
to Caleb.

32:20.973 --> 32:23.240
Oh, I see.

32:23.242 --> 32:25.342
Now you wanna
hang the petticoat,
is that it?

32:25.344 --> 32:28.378
- No.
- Well, good, because
I burned the letter.

32:28.380 --> 32:31.281
You were right.
It's useless.

32:31.283 --> 32:34.117
So I don't need
your laundry line

32:34.119 --> 32:36.553
or your sermon
or your charity.

32:37.522 --> 32:39.089
Shouldn't you
be using that

32:39.091 --> 32:41.425
to buy your husband's
freedom instead?

32:43.995 --> 32:46.163
Abigail knows
about the petticoats.

32:48.132 --> 32:50.067
She saw us meet
with Caleb in the barn.

32:50.069 --> 32:51.668
She knows he
smuggled out a letter

32:51.670 --> 32:53.603
and now she's traveling
with that knowledge
to New York.

32:53.605 --> 32:55.639
That is what
I came here to tell you.

32:55.641 --> 32:59.109
But now I see
it was a mistake.

33:01.379 --> 33:03.113
Wait, Anna, Anna.

33:03.115 --> 33:05.549
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Let me go.

33:05.551 --> 33:07.250
Tell me, what did she say?
Did she mention me?

33:07.252 --> 33:09.586
What does it matter?
Nothing matters, right?

33:09.588 --> 33:11.455
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

33:11.457 --> 33:14.424
Look, everything
I do puts me right
back on my arse.

33:14.426 --> 33:17.427
I have no idea
if my letter got to Ben

33:17.429 --> 33:18.662
or if he got it
to Washington

33:18.664 --> 33:21.231
or if any of it
meant a damn thing.

33:21.233 --> 33:23.700
Look, I do want to
strike against the enemy.

33:23.702 --> 33:25.502
That does matter to me.

33:25.504 --> 33:28.305
Everything matters,
you know that.

33:28.307 --> 33:30.607
You know me, Anna.

33:33.111 --> 33:35.445
You always have.

34:02.273 --> 34:04.041
Oh, God.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.226
What are you doing here?

34:24.228 --> 34:26.663
I live here.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.509
I've had the utmost
regard for this family.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.610
Beyond the kindness
and hospitality,

34:41.612 --> 34:44.347
<i>you, Mrs. Woodhull,</i>
<i>and little Thomas always</i>
<i>stood as a symbol</i>

34:44.349 --> 34:46.283
<i>of what I came here</i>
<i>to fight for.</i>

34:48.619 --> 34:50.687
I suggest you join
your wife and son

34:50.688 --> 34:52.856
at the judge's home
for Epiphany.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.798
<i>( door closes )</i>

35:09.607 --> 35:13.176
I can't make out
the uniforms, can you?

35:13.178 --> 35:15.378
No.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.280
Wait here, I'll see
if I can get closer.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.449
<i>( guns cock )</i>

35:22.787 --> 35:25.255
Victory.

35:25.257 --> 35:27.390
Or death.

35:30.661 --> 35:33.663
( laughs )
You two princesses
made it.

35:33.665 --> 35:36.399
Yeah. Kneel
for your betters, mate.

35:36.401 --> 35:38.368
Glad to see you
in one piece.

35:38.370 --> 35:39.669
Yeah, you, too.

35:39.671 --> 35:41.738
He's the one saved
your swivel gun.

35:41.740 --> 35:44.274
- Boy, did we use it.
- They never saw us coming.

35:44.276 --> 35:47.277
Yeah, surprised those
German bastards right
out of their beds.

35:49.313 --> 35:50.814
Come on.

35:53.417 --> 35:55.318
( whispers )
Christ on a pony.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.654
Hessians.

35:57.656 --> 35:58.722
In Trenton.

35:58.724 --> 36:00.824
Woodhull.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.326
( both laughing )

36:07.498 --> 36:11.601
Ready for the bad news?
Bloodybacks ain't too happy.

36:11.603 --> 36:14.704
Cornwallis is camped
'cross that creek
with all his boys.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.506
Where are
the rest of ours?

36:16.508 --> 36:19.643
Washington marched them off
an hour ago real quiet-like.

36:19.645 --> 36:21.578
Took some local
cut-through to Princeton.

36:21.580 --> 36:23.480
Then what the hell
are we still doing here?

36:24.949 --> 36:27.250
Look alive, boys.

36:33.824 --> 36:36.493
Oh, we're the decoys.

36:43.501 --> 36:45.468
General, I recommend
we attack now

36:45.470 --> 36:47.671
while we still have
the element of surprise.

36:47.673 --> 36:51.608
Cornwallis:
<i>Washington's entire force</i>
<i>is stretched along that bank.</i>

36:51.610 --> 36:54.945
To turn his flank
in this pitch?

36:56.714 --> 36:59.282
Doubtful at best.

37:02.987 --> 37:06.623
Andre:
<i>It must be two,</i>
<i>3,000 men.</i>

37:06.625 --> 37:10.493
- ( men shouting )
- ( pots banging )

37:25.409 --> 37:28.578
( laughing )

37:29.947 --> 37:32.382
Lee: <i>Major Rogers...</i>

37:33.517 --> 37:36.953
I'm afraid we must
retire for the evening.

37:36.955 --> 37:38.521
Oh, no, no, Charles.

37:38.523 --> 37:41.391
You are going to indulge
me one more time.

37:41.393 --> 37:43.493
- ( groans )
- Hey.

37:43.495 --> 37:47.464
You see, Miss Endicott,
I'm intrigued by legends--

37:47.466 --> 37:50.567
- yours, mine,
Washington's.
- Yes.

37:50.569 --> 37:53.737
We established
our reputations

37:53.739 --> 37:55.739
during
the Seven Years' War.

37:55.741 --> 37:57.374
Mm-hmm.

37:57.376 --> 38:00.310
But where we were...

38:00.312 --> 38:02.445
sharpened by success,

38:02.447 --> 38:05.915
George was forged
by failure.

38:05.917 --> 38:08.285
Exactly.

38:08.287 --> 38:11.588
George Washington
is an abysmal tactician.

38:11.590 --> 38:13.556
Always has been.

38:13.558 --> 38:17.494
He gets more men killed
than any commander
has a right.

38:19.363 --> 38:22.499
At least he isn't
a traitor like you.

38:27.738 --> 38:29.606
I beg your pardon?

38:29.608 --> 38:32.609
See, you gave up your men

38:32.611 --> 38:34.944
for 30 pieces of silver.

38:34.946 --> 38:36.780
Yeah.

38:36.782 --> 38:39.349
A Connecticut dragoon unit

38:39.351 --> 38:42.652
filled with
apple-cheeked young boys

38:42.654 --> 38:45.555
<i>fresh from</i>
<i>their mothers' bellies,</i>

38:45.557 --> 38:50.026
fighting for freedom,
fighting for you.

38:50.028 --> 38:54.431
And you gave them up
to John Andre.

38:54.433 --> 38:58.468
And Andre fed them to me.

39:01.639 --> 39:04.407
And we slaughtered them

39:04.409 --> 39:07.344
like dogs.

39:12.416 --> 39:14.851
One of those dragoons
got away.

39:14.853 --> 39:18.922
You are going to
give me his name.

39:24.795 --> 39:27.630
Benjamin Tallmadge.

39:27.632 --> 39:29.032
