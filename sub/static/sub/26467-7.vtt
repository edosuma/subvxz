00:02.600 --> 00:03.750
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

00:03.840 --> 00:05.433
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.120 --> 00:07.190
<i>To the outside world,</i>

00:07.280 --> 00:09.192
<i>I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist.</i>

00:09.320 --> 00:11.357
<i>But secretly,
with the help of my friends</i>

00:11.440 --> 00:12.954
<i>at S.T.A.R. Labs,
I fight crime</i>

00:13.040 --> 00:15.157
<i>and find other meta-humans
like me.</i>

00:15.240 --> 00:17.550
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help,</i>

00:17.640 --> 00:18.676
<i>she changed the present.</i>

00:19.960 --> 00:22.475
<i>And now our world is
more dangerous than ever,</i>

00:22.560 --> 00:24.836
<i>and I'm the only one fast
enough to save it.</i>

00:24.960 --> 00:27.429
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

00:28.360 --> 00:30.079
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:30.160 --> 00:32.231
<i>To be able to control
the weather like that indoors.</i>

00:32.320 --> 00:34.357
<i>He'd have to be
a weather wizard.</i>

00:34.440 --> 00:35.476
<i>This is Sherloque.</i>

00:35.560 --> 00:36.776
<i>He's the greatest detective</i>

00:36.800 --> 00:38.439
<i>in all the multiverse.</i>

00:38.520 --> 00:39.816
<i>I'm here to catch your killer.</i>

00:39.840 --> 00:41.354
The only part
of the satellite

00:41.440 --> 00:43.750
that would have dark matter
levels that high...

00:43.840 --> 00:46.639
<i>Is the core, which is
where Cicada's dagger came from.</i>

00:46.720 --> 00:48.234
We got a list from FEMA
of everyone

00:48.320 --> 00:49.896
<i>who reported injuries
the night of the Enlightenment.</i>

00:49.920 --> 00:52.071
Two of them are twins
whose father is deceased,

00:52.160 --> 00:54.470
third is a ten-year-old girl
by the name of Grace Gibbons.

00:54.560 --> 00:56.756
So if my dad's right
and Cicada's a father, then...

00:56.840 --> 00:58.638
We may have just found
his daughter.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.830
<i>Excuse me, could you tell
me where Grace Gibbons' room is?</i>

01:17.920 --> 01:19.434
<i>One sec, let me check.</i>

01:25.160 --> 01:27.231
Actually, yeah,
she's that first room

01:27.320 --> 01:29.039
<i>- right on the right.
- Great.</i>

01:30.880 --> 01:32.496
<i>Just where do you think
you're going?</i>

01:32.520 --> 01:34.136
Into my patient's room
is what it looks like.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.720
I'm sorry.
I am Barry Allen.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.678
I'm with the CCPD.

01:38.760 --> 01:41.594
<i>I was hoping to speak
with you, actually.</i>

01:41.680 --> 01:43.672
I'm looking
for Grace Gibbons' parents.

01:43.760 --> 01:45.399
Specifically her father.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.552
I'm sorry, but the girl's
parents are deceased.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.957
Are you sure about that?

01:52.040 --> 01:54.555
I can show you her charts.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.559
See for yourself.

01:59.360 --> 02:01.238
She came in with
a wave of new admissions.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.915
No legal guardian listed,
no next of kin.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.559
The sad truth is,

02:05.640 --> 02:08.951
our staff is the only family
this little girl has left.

02:09.039 --> 02:10.633
Okay.

02:10.720 --> 02:12.837
Thank you for your help.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.320
<i>Orlin Dwyer,
are you in there?</i>

02:27.480 --> 02:30.518
It's CCPD.
Open up.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.876
- Orlin Dwyer?
- Hey, listen, man,

02:32.960 --> 02:34.599
I don't care
what that guy says,

02:34.680 --> 02:36.353
he was drunk
and I was defending...

02:36.440 --> 02:39.160
This is about your sister,
Mr. Dwyer.

02:39.240 --> 02:42.199
There's been an accident,
a meta attack.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.956
- Careful.
- I know, I know.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.430
- This is a critical time.
<i>- Okay.</i>

02:59.520 --> 03:01.557
- Steady hands.
- Yeah.

03:05.520 --> 03:06.840
Call time of death.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.196
<i>It's okay. It's a pie.</i>

03:09.280 --> 03:11.476
It's not supposed to be
a piece of cake.

03:11.560 --> 03:12.676
Wow.

03:14.440 --> 03:15.954
Hey, thanks for helping.

03:16.040 --> 03:17.679
With Cicada's trail
running cold,

03:17.800 --> 03:19.400
at least we have the extra day
to prepare

03:19.440 --> 03:21.113
for our first Thanksgiving
at the loft.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.237
What about Joe and Cecile?

03:23.320 --> 03:25.789
They're celebrating
with Cecile's family this year.

03:25.880 --> 03:28.634
So, yeah, this year it's just
gonna be the five of us.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.632
<i>- I'm down.</i>
- Six, actually.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.518
Killer Frost just RSVP'd.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.832
What... you guys can just talk
to each other now,

03:35.920 --> 03:37.560
even without the mental
activity dampener?

03:37.640 --> 03:39.313
Yeah, today's actually
the first time.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.800
Wow.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.075
Oh, gosh.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.270
- Hi, guys.
- Yo.

03:43.360 --> 03:44.496
Sorry we're late.
It seems like

03:44.520 --> 03:46.113
everyone and their grandma
is getting

03:46.200 --> 03:47.475
pre-holiday manis and pedis.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.791
Ooh, let's take photos
and post them

03:49.880 --> 03:53.430
on that old-fashioned Insta
thingy that you guys use.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.751
Those two seemed to have
really patched things up.

03:57.880 --> 04:02.193
Yeah, Nora's getting closer
to Iris than she is with me,

04:02.280 --> 04:03.816
and the timing couldn't have
been better.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.194
What do you mean?

04:05.280 --> 04:07.397
I mean,
Nora was so young

04:07.480 --> 04:09.119
when I disappeared in
her future,

04:09.200 --> 04:11.760
so this would be her
first memory of Thanksgiving

04:11.840 --> 04:13.115
with both her parents.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.759
Feel like it's my job
to make it

04:14.840 --> 04:16.478
the most perfect
Thanksgiving ever,

04:16.560 --> 04:19.951
And #HandModels.

04:20.040 --> 04:23.477
Wow, I feel famous already.

04:23.560 --> 04:24.755
Oh, man.

04:24.840 --> 04:26.638
Mom, um...

04:26.720 --> 04:27.949
I'm sorry.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.191
Sorry for what, Nora?

04:30.280 --> 04:33.876
For not giving you a chance
to show me how great you are.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.391
This year I'm just really
thankful to get to know you.

04:37.480 --> 04:39.676
The real you.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.433
I'm thankful too.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.831
You know, the West-Allens have
never missed a Thanksgiving.

04:44.920 --> 04:47.196
No guerrilla army,
no evil speedster,

04:47.280 --> 04:49.431
no giant wormhole in the sky

04:49.520 --> 04:50.715
could break that streak.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.393
Yeah, the singularity.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.830
So the Flash Museum has
a 3-D model of Dad

04:54.920 --> 04:57.879
just running straight into it
to save the city.

04:57.960 --> 05:00.714
God, it must have been so epic
to be there.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.599
Actually, it was...

05:03.680 --> 05:06.320
terrifying to be there.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.392
We didn't know if your dad
was gonna come back.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.120
<i>Ronnie didn't.</i>

05:14.520 --> 05:16.318
What?

05:17.560 --> 05:21.759
The museum says that...
that Dad just saved everybody.

05:21.880 --> 05:24.793
I guess there's things
the museum left out.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.496
<i>Like your Dad giving himself
to the Speed Force</i>

05:26.520 --> 05:28.000
<i>to save the city.</i>

05:28.080 --> 05:31.994
That was another time we said
good-bye thinking...

05:32.080 --> 05:33.992
might be a one-way trip.

05:34.080 --> 05:38.074
Sounds a lot like what took
him from us in the future.

05:38.160 --> 05:40.550
I didn't know Dad had
so many close calls.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.074
<i>Look, your dad
is always gonna</i>

05:42.160 --> 05:43.800
<i>wanna put his life
on the line for others.</i>

05:43.840 --> 05:46.958
<i>That is what I love most
about him,</i>

05:47.040 --> 05:51.034
but, yeah, it... it
does keep me up at night.

05:56.280 --> 05:57.794
Did he come back?

05:57.880 --> 06:02.193
No, the records I falsified
convinced him for now.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.840
<i>So we're safe?</i>

06:04.920 --> 06:08.197
Orlin, I think you need
to stay away.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.953
Good idea.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.509
I won't visit till
after the weekend.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.997
No, I think you need to stay
away for good.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.390
It's getting too risky.

06:18.520 --> 06:21.194
You want me to give up Grace?

06:21.280 --> 06:22.839
<i>No, no, no, listen,</i>

06:22.920 --> 06:24.559
you can't put me on hold.

06:24.640 --> 06:27.474
I don't care about
this next of kin crap.

06:27.560 --> 06:30.792
I don't want this kid.
Hello?

06:30.880 --> 06:32.200
Hello?

06:32.280 --> 06:34.272
Damn it.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.637
Hey...

06:37.720 --> 06:39.200
what?

06:39.280 --> 06:41.954
It's breakfast.

06:43.480 --> 06:47.076
Yeah, it is.
Um...

06:48.600 --> 06:50.557
Okay.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.234
Now look, it's only
a few days old.

07:05.360 --> 07:06.999
It's still good, I swear.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.913
I don't understand.
Explain again to me

07:34.000 --> 07:35.400
what the difference
between this day

07:35.480 --> 07:37.039
and every other day
in America?

07:37.120 --> 07:40.079
It's a holiday
when we all get together

07:40.160 --> 07:42.470
and celebrate
and eat a ton of food.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.074
Like, a gross amount.

07:44.160 --> 07:46.550
Again, what the difference
between this day

07:46.640 --> 07:48.154
and every other day in America.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.280
- That's legit.
- Hi, guys.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.874
- What's going on?
- This guy,

07:50.960 --> 07:52.536
he try to explain
the Thanksgiving holiday.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.791
<i>He's failing miserably.
What is this holiday?</i>

07:54.880 --> 07:56.997
- Please explain.
- It's very simple, actually.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.696
It's just about getting
together to celebrate

07:58.720 --> 08:00.313
our loved ones and family.

08:00.400 --> 08:04.076
So simple, this is why I
don't understand this holiday.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.096
- I don't have any family.
- Didn't you have, like,

08:06.120 --> 08:08.954
- seven marriages?
- I did have seven marriages.

08:09.040 --> 08:12.590
Five wives, seven marriages,
but no family.

08:12.720 --> 08:15.554
This holiday
is a cruel holiday.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.016
- What's going on?
<i>- I'm seeing a massive</i>

08:26.040 --> 08:27.997
electrical surge
at the power station downtown.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.639
Barry, Nora, you're up.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.954
Guys, what's the problem?

08:45.040 --> 08:46.997
Everything looks...

08:47.080 --> 08:48.639
I think we found it.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.552
- It's lightning.
- Skies were clear

08:50.640 --> 08:52.416
a minute ago. That storm must
have come out of nowhere.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.557
Uh, we got a bigger problem.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.472
<i>There's an experimental
cold fusion core</i>

08:56.560 --> 08:58.791
from Mercury Labs in the plant,
and if it blows...

08:58.880 --> 09:01.679
<i>It could take out
the whole block.</i>

09:01.760 --> 09:03.035
I see it.

09:05.160 --> 09:08.278
Nora, you've got to evac all
the workers to safety. Barry...

09:08.400 --> 09:09.776
Yeah, I know,
I got to grab the core.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.951
No, no, no,
something doesn't feel right.

09:12.040 --> 09:14.839
Just listen to Iris.
Grab the workers from inside.

09:37.080 --> 09:41.711
Dad!

09:41.800 --> 09:43.553
You guys,
he's not breathing.

09:43.640 --> 09:44.915
He's going into
cardiac arrest.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.136
<i>She needs to restart his heart.</i>

09:46.160 --> 09:47.640
What... how do I do that?

09:47.720 --> 09:49.296
Rub your hands together
to create lightning,

09:49.320 --> 09:50.834
<i>and then give him
a chest compression.</i>

09:50.920 --> 09:52.240
Okay! Okay.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.915
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.793
It's not working!

10:10.200 --> 10:12.556
We lost him.

10:12.640 --> 10:15.030
<i>No! No!</i>

10:15.120 --> 10:17.589
No!

10:17.720 --> 10:19.598
Please. Please. Please.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.956
<i>He's back.</i>

10:44.880 --> 10:47.076
- I promise I'm okay.
- Caitlin.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.197
His vitals are stable.
Speed healing to the rescue.

10:49.280 --> 10:50.496
He shouldn't have
needed rescuing.

10:50.520 --> 10:51.795
<i>Nora, I know you're upset,</i>

10:51.920 --> 10:53.056
but if that core would
have exploded

10:53.080 --> 10:54.176
it would have caused
a lot of damage.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.237
It did cause a lot of damage.
Dad died.

10:56.320 --> 10:59.154
We made the best decision we
could, given the circumstances.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.550
Maybe someone else should be
making our decisions.

11:03.840 --> 11:05.274
Wow, all right, well,

11:05.360 --> 11:07.670
so much for mother-daughter
holiday time.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.638
She did just have to bring me
back to life.

11:09.720 --> 11:11.837
- Let's give her a minute.
- Okay.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.594
In the meantime,
where did that storm come from?

11:14.680 --> 11:16.512
A storm like that coming
and going,

11:16.600 --> 11:18.000
disappearing in a matter
of minutes,

11:18.040 --> 11:19.474
it shouldn't be possible.

11:19.560 --> 11:21.597
Unless someone was making
it possible.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.080
I mean, we've seen that before.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.656
Weather Wizard.
But Mark Mardon is serving

11:24.680 --> 11:26.080
a life sentence
at Iron Heights.

11:26.160 --> 11:27.879
Let's make sure he's doing
just that.

11:27.960 --> 11:29.600
Let us know if any other
weather anomalies

11:29.640 --> 11:30.960
pop up on the radar.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.440
Okay.

11:32.520 --> 11:33.920
Will do.

11:39.320 --> 11:42.836
Save the Turkey.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.070
What...?

11:49.160 --> 11:51.231
Art is therapy.

11:51.320 --> 11:52.640
So, Sherlock...

11:52.720 --> 11:54.473
Sherloque,
simple pronunciation.

11:54.560 --> 11:57.473
We heard what you had to say
about not having a family.

11:57.560 --> 12:00.120
- Right.
- And we here at Team Flash are

12:00.200 --> 12:02.376
sort of a family, and you're
becoming part of that family,

12:02.400 --> 12:04.960
so we would like to invite you

12:05.040 --> 12:07.760
to celebrate
Thanksgiving with us.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.799
Caitlin, I'm afraid that
I must decline, all right?

12:10.880 --> 12:12.616
Because I don't have a lot
of reason to celebrate,

12:12.640 --> 12:14.791
and you of all people should
sympathize with that.

12:14.920 --> 12:17.958
- Why should I sympathize?
<i>- You lost your father, right?</i>

12:18.040 --> 12:20.191
And then you find him
only to discover that his body

12:20.280 --> 12:21.999
<i>is being possessed
by a icicle demon</i>

12:22.080 --> 12:23.456
<i>who's trying to kill
all of Team Flash,</i>

12:23.480 --> 12:25.551
<i>yourself included.
Not great, right?</i>

12:25.680 --> 12:27.016
Okay, that's enough,
Debbie Downer.

12:27.040 --> 12:28.474
Don't listen.
You know what?

12:28.600 --> 12:30.273
Maybe you should lay off
the paint fumes.

12:30.360 --> 12:31.919
Do you know what,
young Ralph Macchio?

12:32.000 --> 12:33.576
You have nothing
to celebrate either, right?

12:33.600 --> 12:35.273
What your last year has been,
huh?

12:35.360 --> 12:37.397
Let me recap for you.
First, heartbreak.

12:39.080 --> 12:40.912
And then second,
Cicada crushes your powers

12:41.000 --> 12:42.480
forcing you to fake
your own death,

12:42.560 --> 12:44.870
<i>also not great, and as for me,</i>

12:44.960 --> 12:46.792
multiple divorces have left me

12:46.880 --> 12:49.236
with a mountain of debt
that's insurmountable.

12:49.320 --> 12:53.394
So this past year, not been
very kind to any of us.

12:53.480 --> 12:55.312
Pardon.

13:22.360 --> 13:23.696
<i>She's had a few
recent outbursts,</i>

13:23.720 --> 13:25.154
<i>and we don't allow
cursing here.</i>

13:25.280 --> 13:27.397
<i>This type of behavior
cannot continue.</i>

13:27.480 --> 13:29.016
Anyway, that's the long
and short of it.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.918
I'll give you two a moment.

13:39.560 --> 13:43.270
You called a kid
a rat bastard?

13:43.360 --> 13:44.874
What's wrong with you?
Don't you know

13:44.960 --> 13:46.758
you can't go around
saying stuff like that?

13:46.840 --> 13:48.194
Why?

13:48.280 --> 13:50.351
Well, 'cause
then I get a phone call.

13:50.440 --> 13:52.671
You know, I had to take off
work to come down here.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.514
- You don't even like your job.
- What?

13:55.600 --> 13:57.319
You stay on the couch
all day,

13:57.400 --> 13:58.550
and then when work calls

13:58.640 --> 13:59.994
you curse and slam the door.

14:00.080 --> 14:03.073
"Rat bastards."

14:03.160 --> 14:05.959
Look,
I get where you heard it.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.350
All right, but you can't say
those words.

14:08.440 --> 14:09.715
- Rat bastard!
- Hey, quit it.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.200
- Rat bastard!
- Stop.

14:11.280 --> 14:12.794
- Rat bastards!
- Hey, listen to me!

14:12.880 --> 14:14.240
I'm supposed to be
the parent here.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.233
No, you're not a parent!

14:17.320 --> 14:19.835
Parents are supposed to make
the world better for their kids.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.714
You make everything worse.
I hate you,

14:22.840 --> 14:24.399
and you hate you too.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.318
<i>You have to excuse
our dim lighting.</i>

14:32.400 --> 14:33.800
Today's storm out
at the power plant

14:33.840 --> 14:35.479
knocked out our main generator,

14:35.600 --> 14:37.671
So we're working off a backup
for the time being.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.114
So does that mean
you can't dampen

14:39.200 --> 14:41.032
the meta prisoners' powers?

14:41.120 --> 14:43.077
Prison-wide dampeners
are down,

14:43.160 --> 14:46.949
but we got every inmate
into meta cuffs incident free.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.918
I hope you include that in your
article about our readiness.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.456
After the corruption
of the last warden,

14:53.480 --> 14:54.994
I am eager to assure the public

14:55.120 --> 14:57.191
that their safety
is in good hands.

14:57.280 --> 15:00.432
Now, our CSI's, which inmate
did you need to see?

15:02.320 --> 15:03.959
And he's been here all day?

15:04.040 --> 15:05.838
Never once out of our sight.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.240
There was a crime
committed today

15:07.320 --> 15:08.754
with an MO similar
to Mardon's.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.797
Can I take a look
at the security tapes?

15:10.880 --> 15:13.714
Anything for our friends
in the press.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.037
Well, this is a bust.

15:17.120 --> 15:20.113
Yeah, looks like you died
for nothing.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.669
Nora, hey, hey, look.

15:22.760 --> 15:24.592
This has been a rough day
for you,

15:24.680 --> 15:26.876
but you can't blame Iris
for what happened.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.474
She's doing the best she can.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.597
Besides,
we both decided on the plan.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.353
Oh, I know.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.759
What the...?

15:46.400 --> 15:47.800
<i>Hey, don't mind me.</i>

15:47.880 --> 15:50.270
I'm just here to pick up
my dad.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.952
Did she say "dad"?

15:54.040 --> 15:55.110
Joslyn?

15:55.200 --> 15:57.510
It's Joss.

16:04.120 --> 16:06.589
Bring me my father!
Now!

16:06.680 --> 16:08.956
Yeah, that's not
gonna happen.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.520
We'll see about that.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.240
Bring my dad to Porter Plaza
in one hour,

16:13.320 --> 16:15.960
or Central City is gonna
get wrecked.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.954
I didn't know that Joslyn
was busting me out.

16:30.040 --> 16:32.430
I didn't know she'd do
half the things she does.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.239
I haven't spoken to her
in years.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.073
And you expect me
to believe she woke up

16:36.160 --> 16:37.816
this morning and was like,
"You know what?

16:37.840 --> 16:39.559
I wanna break my dad
out of Iron Heights."

16:39.640 --> 16:43.236
I get it, but it's the truth.

16:43.320 --> 16:47.109
Joss was born when me and her
mom were still in high school.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.637
I never could work out
how to be with that woman.

16:50.720 --> 16:53.633
Then when Joss came
I thought the best thing to do

16:53.720 --> 16:56.952
was to focus on my career.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.430
Your criminal career?

16:59.520 --> 17:01.318
That's why I left her
with her mom.

17:01.400 --> 17:04.233
Least until she ran away
because some of falling out.

17:04.319 --> 17:06.198
What happened with Joss
and her mom?

17:06.280 --> 17:08.237
The last time I spoke to her

17:08.319 --> 17:11.358
she told me that her and Joss
are broken.

17:11.440 --> 17:12.920
You know how it is.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.593
Sometimes mothers
and daughters break

17:14.720 --> 17:17.280
and there ain't no fixing 'em.

17:31.920 --> 17:35.550
<i>Okay, watch your step.</i>

17:35.640 --> 17:39.873
And open your eyes.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.199
<i>Whose house is this?</i>

17:43.280 --> 17:45.272
It's my cousin Robbie's.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.716
He doesn't live here anymore,
but he said

17:47.800 --> 17:50.520
if I fix it up,
we could stay here.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.600
What's this?

17:53.680 --> 17:57.515
That is a dollhouse.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.354
Or it can be

18:00.440 --> 18:04.559
once we build it,
and, you know, you can...

18:06.120 --> 18:09.431
Pick out furniture, and colors,

18:09.520 --> 18:14.072
or wall paper,
decorate it how you want.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.712
Hey...

18:17.800 --> 18:19.837
I know we didn't get off
to the greatest start

18:19.920 --> 18:21.832
these past few months.

18:21.920 --> 18:24.230
Okay...

18:24.320 --> 18:26.198
it was a lousy start.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.875
But I want to fix all that.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.916
Well, I was thinking that
while I work on this place,

18:34.000 --> 18:39.837
we could work
on this one too... together.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.836
Listen, you were right, kid.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.798
I do hate me.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.475
<i>I don't really know
any other way to be,</i>

18:49.560 --> 18:54.032
but I want to do right by you,
Gracie.

18:54.120 --> 18:59.354
I want to keep you safe,
and warm, fed...

19:01.160 --> 19:03.595
You know, just...

19:03.680 --> 19:06.798
give you all the things
a kid should have.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.351
Let's start with
the dollhouse.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.233
Okay.

19:26.280 --> 19:27.794
Okay.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.276
How's Dad's interrogation
going?

19:32.360 --> 19:34.576
Well, we'll know in a minute.
Hopefully, he'll find something

19:34.600 --> 19:36.136
that'll help us profile
Mardon's daughter.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.277
Okay, well, let me know.

19:38.360 --> 19:40.920
Nora, look, listen,
I know you're upset with me

19:41.000 --> 19:43.071
for sending your dad
into that situation earlier,

19:43.200 --> 19:44.839
and I just...

19:44.920 --> 19:47.116
- I wanted to say that I...
- Mom, it's okay.

19:47.200 --> 19:48.680
I'm not upset with you.

19:48.760 --> 19:50.479
- You're not?
- No, we're good.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.313
I-I promise.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.631
Okay, cool.

19:54.720 --> 19:57.030
That's the other thing,
celebrating the decimation

19:57.120 --> 19:59.874
of an indigenous culture
so a bunch of greedy colonizers

19:59.960 --> 20:01.792
can get their turkey-lurkey on.

20:01.880 --> 20:03.576
Do you know about this?
Do you know about the sham?

20:03.600 --> 20:05.717
The sham we call
"Thanksgiving."

20:05.800 --> 20:07.712
Okay, I'm sorry,
am I missing something?

20:07.800 --> 20:10.110
Since when did you guys become
anti-Thanksgiving?

20:10.200 --> 20:12.351
Since a bunch of guys wearing
hat-buckles

20:12.480 --> 20:15.518
fed us some old bull,
wrapped in lies,

20:15.600 --> 20:17.831
<i>stuffed in propaganda.</i>

20:17.920 --> 20:19.832
It's a deception Turducken.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.639
Actually,
I think the hat-buckles

20:21.720 --> 20:24.030
- weren't real either.
- Don't encourage him.

20:24.120 --> 20:26.271
- You get it.
- Okay.

20:26.360 --> 20:27.640
Did you get anything
from Mardon?

20:27.680 --> 20:30.240
No, nothing that'll help us
find his daughter.

20:30.320 --> 20:31.456
What about you guys?
What'd you dig up?

20:31.480 --> 20:33.073
Meet Joss Jackam.

20:33.160 --> 20:35.550
She is a delinquent teen
turned amateur storm chaser.

20:35.640 --> 20:38.075
<i>A self-taught expert
in theoretical meteorology.</i>

20:38.160 --> 20:39.640
How do we know
she's a storm chaser?

20:39.720 --> 20:41.552
'Cause Helen Hunt
here has a blog.

20:41.640 --> 20:44.314
Mm-hmm. She lost her grant
from the Science Center

20:44.400 --> 20:46.456
for doing too many dangerous
experiments on the weather.

20:46.480 --> 20:50.235
Well, look like she's way
beyond the experimental phase.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.391
Ooh, Weather Witch?

20:52.520 --> 20:53.795
I'll allow it.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.872
Dad, that weathervane,

20:55.960 --> 20:57.917
doesn't it look a lot like...

20:58.000 --> 20:59.878
The staff she was carrying,
yeah.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.640
<i>Cisco, can you pull up
the security footage</i>

21:01.720 --> 21:02.936
from her attack
on Iron Heights?

21:02.960 --> 21:04.713
<i>Sure can.</i>

21:05.360 --> 21:08.319
<i>It's infected
with a satellite shard.</i>

21:08.400 --> 21:10.869
- She's got meta-tech.
- Like Spencer Young's phone.

21:10.960 --> 21:13.077
Look, she has instant
lightning on command.

21:13.160 --> 21:14.336
There's no way
you're gonna be able

21:14.360 --> 21:15.589
to get that staff from her.

21:15.680 --> 21:17.096
She's gonna have
to give it up willingly.

21:17.120 --> 21:18.474
Okay, listen,
we got 20 minutes

21:18.560 --> 21:19.936
before she destroys
the entire city,

21:19.960 --> 21:21.679
so what is the plan?

21:21.800 --> 21:24.190
We only have one choice.

21:24.280 --> 21:26.875
We give her what she wants.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.073
No Weather Witch in sight.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.576
<i>Okay,
Singh cleared the perimeter,</i>

21:31.600 --> 21:33.034
so it's free of civilians.

21:33.120 --> 21:35.271
And our satellites
are on weather watch

21:35.360 --> 21:37.272
for our Weather Witch.
Nothing yet.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.953
Well...

21:39.040 --> 21:40.872
I wouldn't say nothing.

21:40.960 --> 21:42.758
<i>My data leaves me to conclude</i>

21:42.840 --> 21:44.354
that there is
artificially-created

21:44.440 --> 21:46.079
pressure system
of uncertain origin

21:46.160 --> 21:48.675
headed <i>rapidement</i>
toward the downtown core.

21:48.760 --> 21:50.479
Listen, Galileo,
you can lick your finger

21:50.560 --> 21:52.074
and stick it in the wind
all you want.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.958
Why don't you leave
the actual calculations

21:54.080 --> 21:57.278
to actual compu...
oh, for Christ's sake.

21:57.360 --> 22:00.000
And your exasperation
leads me also to conclude

22:00.080 --> 22:01.912
that you have realized,
although late,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.799
that once again I'm right.
I'm right. I'm right.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.156
<i>I'm right. I'm right...</i>

22:09.280 --> 22:10.430
That's enough out of you.

22:13.720 --> 22:16.474
She's here.

22:16.560 --> 22:20.520
So the rotten apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.672
You're a poet.
Awesome.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.114
Where's my dad?

22:27.960 --> 22:30.600
All right, Joss, we held up
our end of the bargain.

22:30.680 --> 22:31.875
You got your dad.

22:31.960 --> 22:33.394
There's no reason
to hurt anybody...

22:33.480 --> 22:34.960
Ah, so boring. Come on.

22:35.080 --> 22:37.037
We'll handle it from here.

22:37.120 --> 22:38.520
Hey, baby girl.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.114
Dad.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.714
That's a pretty cool staff.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.440
Would you just... how about
you just power

22:43.480 --> 22:46.678
that thing off for a sec
and let your dad try.

22:46.800 --> 22:47.759
Try this.

22:52.160 --> 22:53.310
Oh, no.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.154
Oh.

23:01.440 --> 23:04.080
Oh, oh, don't feel bad.
He was a selfish dick

23:04.160 --> 23:06.197
who abandoned his family.

23:06.320 --> 23:10.280
Anyway, thanks for helping me
drop a truck on my dad.

23:21.040 --> 23:23.271
Uh... guys?

23:25.520 --> 23:27.477
What now?

23:32.440 --> 23:34.671
I didn't see the Hummer coming.

23:34.760 --> 23:37.116
I'm so pissed!

23:37.200 --> 23:40.034
This city will drown,

23:40.120 --> 23:43.591
crumble, burn,
because of you!

23:50.160 --> 23:51.719
Thanks.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.757
I'm gonna follow her.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.559
Wait, are you serious
right now?

23:55.640 --> 23:57.154
- What?
- You almost just died.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.118
Again, and you don't
seem to care.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.429
Where is this coming from?

24:00.520 --> 24:02.034
You know how dangerous
our job is.

24:02.120 --> 24:03.720
Yeah, but I don't want
to lose you again,

24:03.760 --> 24:06.320
but you don't seem to give
a damn if you lose me,

24:06.400 --> 24:07.675
and... and all for your job.

24:07.760 --> 24:09.160
Nora.

24:28.480 --> 24:31.439
How long you been holding
that one in?

24:31.520 --> 24:33.796
My best guess...

24:33.880 --> 24:35.633
my whole life.

24:38.200 --> 24:42.399
Growing up without you,
I was so angry...

24:42.480 --> 24:46.952
but you were my hero, so...

24:47.040 --> 24:50.556
it was easier to put my anger
for you not being around

24:50.640 --> 24:56.238
on criminals
and meta-villains...

24:56.320 --> 24:58.232
a lot of times on Mom.

24:59.520 --> 25:02.160
But when I saw you die today

25:02.240 --> 25:05.836
it reminded me that

25:05.920 --> 25:11.120
I'm mad at someone else
about losing you...

25:11.200 --> 25:13.715
you.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.359
I get it.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.439
It's not easy having a parent

25:21.520 --> 25:23.477
who puts their life on the line
for others.

25:23.560 --> 25:25.950
I remember feeling
the same way about Joe

25:26.040 --> 25:30.398
- being a cop when I was a kid.
- No, it's not the same thing.

25:30.480 --> 25:32.676
Did he ever have to say
good-bye to you knowing

25:32.800 --> 25:35.793
that he wasn't coming back?

25:35.880 --> 25:37.792
You did...

25:37.880 --> 25:40.111
and you're gonna do it again.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.856
Nora, you got to remember
you're talking about

25:41.880 --> 25:43.553
a future that we might be able
to avoid.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.677
We still have time to find
our way to a solution,

25:45.760 --> 25:47.274
<i>and we will.</i>

25:47.360 --> 25:50.000
But there is a solution.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.993
It's just one
that you don't want.

25:54.800 --> 25:57.599
Give up being The Flash.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.717
Come on.
It's the only way to guarantee

25:59.800 --> 26:01.598
that you won't disappear again
in the future,

26:01.680 --> 26:02.796
or any other time.

26:02.880 --> 26:05.520
- Nora.
- Come on. Think about it.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.557
You're not the only hero.

26:07.640 --> 26:10.872
Let the others protect
the world.

26:10.960 --> 26:14.158
You don't have to keep
sacrificing yourself.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.550
You give your life
again and again.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.075
How many times
does it have to be you?

26:20.760 --> 26:24.197
It hurt so much

26:24.280 --> 26:27.114
losing you
when I didn't even know you,

26:27.200 --> 26:30.238
but now
after all of these months

26:30.320 --> 26:32.232
getting to know you I just...

26:32.360 --> 26:34.317
please, Dad, don't make me go
through it again.

26:34.400 --> 26:37.120
I don't want to go through
it again.

26:43.600 --> 26:46.832
Nora, people need The Flash.

26:59.240 --> 27:01.232
I need my dad.

27:17.520 --> 27:19.720
<i>This is the third
ice cream of the day, you know?</i>

27:20.680 --> 27:24.515
Something fishy's going
on here.

27:24.600 --> 27:27.434
Okay, you got me.

27:27.520 --> 27:28.840
We're celebrating

27:28.920 --> 27:32.834
because this is
a very special day.

27:32.960 --> 27:34.599
One year ago today,

27:34.680 --> 27:36.637
I made you a promise

27:36.720 --> 27:38.279
that I would turn
my life around

27:38.360 --> 27:40.397
and make things better for you.

27:40.480 --> 27:43.314
I can honestly say
that my life

27:43.400 --> 27:46.996
is a million times better
than what it was.

27:47.080 --> 27:49.720
And it's all because of you,
Gracie.

27:49.800 --> 27:52.679
So I got you something.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.712
It's the set I wanted.

27:57.800 --> 28:01.237
I thought your little
dollhouse could use a family.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.715
I already have one.

28:07.800 --> 28:09.917
I love you, kiddo.

28:11.400 --> 28:14.393
- Purple.
- You know, I think four

28:14.480 --> 28:17.473
ice creams in a day
would be the...

28:57.480 --> 28:59.073
Gracie, run.

28:59.160 --> 29:01.197
Run. Run. Come on!

29:04.000 --> 29:06.356
Go this way!
Go this way!

29:27.200 --> 29:28.793
Help me!

29:28.880 --> 29:30.360
Help me, please!

29:30.440 --> 29:33.353
- Sir.
- Somebody!

29:36.360 --> 29:38.716
Save her, please.

29:38.800 --> 29:42.350
Get him on a table.

29:43.960 --> 29:46.429
Move!

29:48.400 --> 29:51.040
<i>Gracie...</i>

29:53.680 --> 29:55.353
<i>Help her...</i>

29:55.480 --> 29:57.039
<i>On the eve of Thanksgiving,</i>

29:57.120 --> 29:59.635
<i>reports of devastating
weather phenomena</i>

29:59.720 --> 30:02.110
<i>are streaming in
from all over the city.</i>

30:02.200 --> 30:05.432
<i>The exact cause of these
disturbances remains unknown.</i>

30:05.520 --> 30:06.896
I can't believe
she's actually willing

30:06.920 --> 30:09.310
to level the city
to kill one man.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.153
She doesn't know
where Mardon is.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.336
It's overkill, but it's
the only option we've left her.

30:13.360 --> 30:15.033
Well, Caitlin's on radar,

30:15.120 --> 30:16.616
and Cisco's trying
to juice the satellites,

30:16.640 --> 30:19.633
but there's interference.
We can't locate Joss.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.514
You okay?

30:24.200 --> 30:27.193
Look, babe,
you're gonna find the words

30:27.280 --> 30:29.158
to make her understand.
I know it.

30:29.240 --> 30:32.233
Not sure I have the words
to make myself understand.

30:32.320 --> 30:34.073
She's got a point.

30:39.600 --> 30:40.875
We got a hit on Joss.

30:40.960 --> 30:42.553
She's at
Sheldon County Airport.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.518
Barry, you got to move.

30:58.880 --> 31:00.216
- You're good?
<i>- Barry, do you have eyes</i>

31:00.240 --> 31:01.754
<i>- on Joss?</i>
- No, she's damaged

31:01.880 --> 31:03.155
the terminal so badly

31:03.240 --> 31:04.754
<i>the hangar's the
only safe place.</i>

31:04.880 --> 31:07.236
I'm evacuating everyone
trapped on the tarmac.

31:07.320 --> 31:08.549
I think I can bring
Frost out.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.472
- What can we do?
- Flood control

31:10.560 --> 31:11.960
down at the Marina.

31:12.040 --> 31:14.760
Guys, how do we fight
weather?

31:17.040 --> 31:19.635
We fight weather
with weather.

31:19.720 --> 31:21.200
Nora.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.680
We still have
Mardon's weather wand.

31:22.760 --> 31:24.096
I need you to get it
from the archives

31:24.120 --> 31:25.520
and take it to Barry, okay?

31:25.600 --> 31:27.637
Okay.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.957
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:33.080 --> 31:34.912
Mardon's wand?
Cisco says you can use it

31:35.000 --> 31:36.753
to counteract Joss's weather.

31:36.840 --> 31:38.194
Where is she?

31:41.360 --> 31:44.512
Last chance.
Where's my Dad?

31:44.600 --> 31:46.000
Joss, you know
we can't give him up.

31:46.080 --> 31:49.278
Then you know
what happens next.

31:49.360 --> 31:52.432
Joss, I deceived you, okay?
Not them.

31:52.520 --> 31:54.159
You want make someone pay,
it's me.

31:54.240 --> 31:57.631
This is how you make
heroes pay!

32:07.640 --> 32:09.677
By the beard of Zeus,
she's making

32:09.760 --> 32:12.753
a tornado out of lightning.

32:13.720 --> 32:15.757
Cisco, how do I use this wand
to stop this?

32:15.840 --> 32:17.536
<i>You can attract
all the lightning to the wand.</i>

32:17.560 --> 32:20.280
That'll take down the tornado,
but all that energy

32:20.360 --> 32:21.555
will go through your body.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.359
You'll be a human
lightning rod.

32:35.280 --> 32:37.749
It's okay.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.354
I know you have to go.

32:40.240 --> 32:42.197
Run, Dad. Run!

33:01.880 --> 33:04.236
Back.
Everybody, back.

33:56.640 --> 33:59.200
Barry?
Nora, do you see him?

34:02.400 --> 34:04.153
<i>I, uh...</i>

34:04.240 --> 34:06.596
I...

34:13.719 --> 34:15.632
I see him.
He's still here.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.960
<i>We live in a world
full of meta-phones</i>

34:37.040 --> 34:38.360
<i>and meta-weathervanes.</i>

34:38.440 --> 34:40.193
What's next?
My electric toothbrush?

34:40.280 --> 34:42.511
Till we figure out
how to remove those shards,

34:42.639 --> 34:45.109
better safe than sorry.
Yeah.

34:45.199 --> 34:46.873
Well, now that Mardon
and his daughter

34:46.960 --> 34:49.190
are all tucked away
in Iron Heights,

34:49.280 --> 34:52.193
what do you say we spend
some time with our own family?

34:52.280 --> 34:55.159
Well, might just be
us and Nora this year.

34:55.239 --> 34:57.516
Caitlin and Cisco
are skipping Thanksgiving.

34:57.600 --> 34:58.954
What? Why?

34:59.040 --> 35:01.839
- Don't even ask.
- What?

35:01.920 --> 35:04.640
- A toast to...
- Mm-hmm.

35:04.720 --> 35:06.791
The thankless.

35:06.880 --> 35:08.678
- The thankless!
- The thankless!

35:08.760 --> 35:10.240
The thankless!

35:10.320 --> 35:11.595
<i>Allez-oop.</i>

35:11.680 --> 35:13.399
- Mm.
- Mm.

35:13.480 --> 35:16.120
Aw.

35:18.480 --> 35:20.790
All right, boys,
I'm tapping in.

35:20.880 --> 35:22.473
Okay, let me get this straight.

35:22.560 --> 35:24.597
You two losers are sitting here

35:24.680 --> 35:27.912
in what I can only assume is
the cantina of a starship,

35:28.000 --> 35:31.038
<i>drinking and eating
terrible food</i>

35:31.120 --> 35:33.794
when you could be drinking
and eating amazing food

35:33.880 --> 35:36.440
with people who actually
care about you.

35:38.200 --> 35:39.759
All right, all right, look.

35:39.840 --> 35:41.559
When you put it
like that...

35:41.640 --> 35:43.597
- She has a point.
- You have a point, yeah.

35:43.680 --> 35:46.354
And, by the way, I have the
least to celebrate this year

35:46.440 --> 35:49.274
because I spent
most of it unconscious.

35:50.080 --> 35:52.231
You nerds coming
to Thanksgiving, or what?

35:58.600 --> 36:02.389
<i>So it wasn't so much
the taste as it was the crunch.</i>

36:02.480 --> 36:03.800
Wait, are you actually
saying...

36:03.880 --> 36:05.758
Yes, that was the year
I found out

36:05.840 --> 36:08.799
why Grandma Esther's yams
tasted so good,

36:08.880 --> 36:10.792
because she never cleaned
her favorite skillet.

36:12.600 --> 36:15.798
I take it this was
also the year

36:15.880 --> 36:18.520
you stopped eating
Grandma Esther's yams?

36:18.600 --> 36:21.399
Uh-uh, I didn't say all that.

36:23.360 --> 36:25.397
Allow me to propose a toast.

36:25.480 --> 36:28.917
Well,
first to clean dishware,

36:29.040 --> 36:32.351
and also to... to family,
all right,

36:32.440 --> 36:35.638
and to friends,
old and new.

36:38.160 --> 36:40.800
And to the colonizers
who conquered this land...

36:40.880 --> 36:42.917
<i>- What?
- And...</i>

36:43.000 --> 36:45.435
<i>- the colonizers who grabbed...
- Remember... no...</i>

36:45.520 --> 36:47.056
What they want,
they just take what they want.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.936
- Yes, I know, but our...
<i>- To taking what you...</i>

36:48.960 --> 36:51.111
That's not... you know what?
Let's go.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.456
- Right now.
- Okay, you know what?

36:52.480 --> 36:55.632
I think that it's time
to go carve the turkey.

36:55.720 --> 36:56.995
Great.

36:57.080 --> 36:59.231
Nora.

36:59.360 --> 37:02.671
Um, we didn't have a chance to
talk since the airport.

37:02.760 --> 37:04.240
Oh, Dad, I know
what you're gonna say,

37:04.320 --> 37:05.674
and you don't have to.

37:05.760 --> 37:07.319
I saw what it was like

37:07.400 --> 37:09.357
when you hesitated
to save those people

37:09.440 --> 37:13.514
because of me,
and I felt...

37:13.600 --> 37:16.160
- Horrible?
- Yeah.

37:16.240 --> 37:18.709
And I never want to feel
like that again.

37:18.800 --> 37:21.031
I get it.

37:21.120 --> 37:26.752
Sometimes you have to sacrifice
yourself to save others.

37:26.840 --> 37:29.196
Even if it means leaving
your family behind.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.397
Not exactly.

37:31.480 --> 37:35.713
Look, when I ran
into that storm I was thinking

37:35.800 --> 37:38.713
I want to save everyone,
but...

37:38.800 --> 37:42.874
the person I was thinking
about the most was you.

37:42.960 --> 37:46.397
- Me?
- Yeah.

37:46.480 --> 37:51.236
I don't choose being The Flash
over being with my family.

37:51.320 --> 37:54.154
I'm The Flash for my family,

37:54.240 --> 37:56.038
and I don't have to run
to the future

37:56.120 --> 37:58.840
to understand why
I sacrificed myself.

37:58.960 --> 38:02.271
I'd do it to save you,
and your mom,

38:03.240 --> 38:05.357
all the people I love.

38:05.440 --> 38:08.399
You know, maybe one day
if I train enough,

38:08.480 --> 38:10.358
I'll be able to save you.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.600
I don't doubt it.

38:15.440 --> 38:17.750
- All right, come on.
- Okay.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.274
- Ah, yes.
- All right.

38:19.400 --> 38:20.840
- Hey, thank God.
- Carve the turkey.

38:20.920 --> 38:22.957
- Yeah, baby.
<i>- Here we are.</i>

38:23.040 --> 38:24.474
- Each person gets a turkey.
- No.

38:24.560 --> 38:26.153
- Oh.
- We have the one for everyone.

38:26.280 --> 38:27.856
- You all right?
- Just Dad with a knife,

38:27.880 --> 38:29.536
- it's a little...
- It's the most fun part.

38:29.560 --> 38:30.856
<i>âªâª I got all
my sisters with me âªâª</i>

38:30.880 --> 38:32.678
<i>Oh, you're very good
at that.</i>

38:32.760 --> 38:34.035
Am I?

38:44.080 --> 38:45.560
<i>Orlin.</i>

38:48.040 --> 38:50.316
I told you it's too risky.

38:50.400 --> 38:54.189
CCPD's already looking for you.
What are you doing here?

38:54.280 --> 38:58.877
It's Thanksgiving, Doc.
I'm here to be with my family.

39:10.040 --> 39:11.952
<i>I want you to be optimistic,</i>

39:12.040 --> 39:13.520
but I'm not gonna lie to you.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.273
As far as how long,

39:15.360 --> 39:17.556
with all the brain hemorrhaging
she suffered,

39:17.640 --> 39:19.757
<i>you have to prepare yourself
for the possibility</i>

39:19.840 --> 39:22.878
<i>that she may never wake.</i>

39:22.960 --> 39:27.352
This is all my fault.

39:27.440 --> 39:30.512
<i>No, it's these metas.</i>

39:30.600 --> 39:32.637
Wreaking havoc unchecked.

39:32.720 --> 39:35.235
<i>She didn't deserve this,
Mr. Dwyer,</i>

39:35.960 --> 39:37.553
and neither did you.

39:46.840 --> 39:49.309
<i>This was the scene
Tuesday night as, once again,</i>

39:49.400 --> 39:52.598
<i>The Flash saved Central City
from certain destruction.</i>

39:52.680 --> 39:54.512
<i>After a world-wide
power outage</i>

39:54.600 --> 39:56.637
<i>blanketed every country
in darkness,</i>

39:56.720 --> 40:00.157
<i>a bizarre purple...</i>

40:00.240 --> 40:02.436
<i>The destructive phenomenon
emanated</i>

40:02.520 --> 40:04.159
<i>from a satellite
that had fallen</i>

40:04.240 --> 40:06.118
<i>into a decaying orbit.</i>

40:06.200 --> 40:08.476
<i>Thankfully, before
the satellite could strike</i>

40:08.560 --> 40:11.075
<i>the city and create
what scientists believe</i>

40:11.160 --> 40:13.231
<i>would have been
"a catastrophic event,"</i>

40:13.320 --> 40:16.199
<i>The Flash was able
to destroy it.</i>

40:16.280 --> 40:19.000
<i>Once again, residents
of our proud city,</i>

40:19.080 --> 40:21.914
<i>and perhaps the entire world
owe The Flash</i>

40:22.000 --> 40:25.198
<i>and his allies...</i>

40:28.880 --> 40:31.918
<i>A new meta was last seen
jumping off a building</i>

40:32.000 --> 40:34.674
<i>in order to evade capture
after stealing jewels...</i>

40:36.560 --> 40:39.200
<i>It was reported that
he escaped Flash's grasp</i>

40:39.280 --> 40:42.717
<i>after hijacking
an armored vehicle.</i>

40:56.920 --> 40:59.958
<i>I'm gonna make this
right, Gracie.</i>

41:00.040 --> 41:03.954
Every meta...

41:04.040 --> 41:06.475
will die.

41:13.800 --> 41:15.553
Guys, this better be good.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.480
Yeah, we've got an
after-Thanksgiving tradition

41:17.560 --> 41:20.473
called sleeping,
so what's up?

41:20.560 --> 41:22.836
It's good. Trust us.
Detective.

41:22.920 --> 41:25.071
Well,
it occurred to me that if you,

41:25.160 --> 41:26.640
monsieur and madam West-Allen,

41:26.720 --> 41:29.599
you want to spend this holiday
with your family.

41:29.680 --> 41:32.479
Well, perhaps your meta-killer
does as well.

41:32.560 --> 41:35.234
So I had monsieur Cisco hack
into the CCTV footage

41:35.320 --> 41:39.234
<i>of the hospital
and this what we got.</i>

41:39.320 --> 41:41.755
Ever since Grace arrived,

41:41.840 --> 41:45.038
only one man has come
to visit her.

41:45.120 --> 41:47.112
<i>Every day.</i>

41:47.200 --> 41:48.634
<i>Including tonight.</i>

41:49.360 --> 41:52.194
Team Flash,
I give you...

41:52.320 --> 41:55.552
Orlin Dwyer,
also known as...

41:55.640 --> 41:57.120
Cicada.

42:20.640 --> 42:22.040
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
