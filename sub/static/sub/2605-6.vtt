WEBVTT

01:47.357 --> 01:49.108
$223 billion,

01:49.193 --> 01:51.360
putting an edge on
the current fight on Capitol Hill

01:51.445 --> 01:53.696
about how deeply to cut this year's spending,

01:53.781 --> 01:56.282
along with projections
that it would bring the debt ceiling...

01:56.366 --> 01:58.868
Excuse me. The deficit to $1.6 trillion,

01:58.952 --> 02:02.288
ensuring that the debt ceiling
will be hit during this fiscal year.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.207
That's News Night. Thanks for washing us...

02:04.291 --> 02:06.042
Watching us. Let me get out of here.

02:06.210 --> 02:09.337
Will McAvoy is coming up with
The Capitol Report from Washington.

02:09.421 --> 02:11.130
I'm Terry... No.

02:11.215 --> 02:12.673
- Wow.
- That's not true.

02:13.383 --> 02:14.884
End the broadcast.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.594
- I'm Will McAvoy.
- Attaboy.

02:16.678 --> 02:20.139
Terry Smith is coming up, mercifully,
with The Capitol Report from Washington.

02:20.224 --> 02:21.891
Good night.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.897
- What is wrong with you?
- I'm fine.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.315
"Thank you for washing us"?

02:29.399 --> 02:30.399
Think people noticed?

02:30.484 --> 02:31.984
I do.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.110
Stand here on this spot.

02:33.195 --> 02:35.530
- What are you doing?
- Administering an eye exam.

02:35.614 --> 02:37.907
- Excellent.
- Read the top line.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.326
- E.
- Next line.

02:40.410 --> 02:41.661
I don't know why
people think there's a problem

02:41.745 --> 02:42.829
with health care in this country.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.914
- Our current system is fine.
- Next line.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.000
L-G. The next line, R-T-Z.

02:48.085 --> 02:51.170
The Greek letter for pi,
then geometric symbol for congruent,

02:51.255 --> 02:52.880
and something off
the table of natural elements.

02:52.965 --> 02:55.091
Great, put your tie back on
and get in the studio

02:55.175 --> 02:57.385
so we can retape that for the West Coast.

02:58.762 --> 02:59.887
What's the problem?

02:59.972 --> 03:01.430
I didn't get much sleep last night.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.057
- How much is not much?
- None.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.517
Seriously?

03:04.601 --> 03:06.727
I went to bed at midnight, didn't fall asleep.

03:06.812 --> 03:08.354
Is this the first time that's happened?

03:08.438 --> 03:10.022
- No.
- Is it the second time?

03:10.107 --> 03:12.358
I'm having a little bout with insomnia.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.693
Have you tried Ambien?

03:13.777 --> 03:15.528
I don't wanna wake up
in the middle of the Triborough Bridge

03:15.612 --> 03:17.530
eating scrambled eggs in my pajamas.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.825
How those
eggs got into my pajamas I'll never know.

03:21.243 --> 03:22.702
You shouldn't do Groucho.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.078
But seriously, you need to sleep

03:24.162 --> 03:26.497
or you're gonna forget to
thank people for washing us.

03:26.582 --> 03:28.124
I'm seeing my guy tomorrow at 10:00.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.750
- Who's your guy?
- Abe.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.460
- Who's Abe?
- Dr. Habib.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.379
You're still seeing Abe?

03:33.463 --> 03:36.048
That's wonderful, Will.
Everyone could use a little therapy.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.301
And you a lot more than most.
I'm glad you're doing that.

03:38.427 --> 03:39.427
Well...

03:39.511 --> 03:40.803
You've been skipping appointments?

03:42.139 --> 03:44.098
- Sometimes.
- When was the last time you saw him?

03:44.182 --> 03:45.892
- What's today, the 12th?
- Yeah.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.311
- About four years ago.
- Why did you stop seeing him?

03:48.395 --> 03:50.479
- I've kept the appointments.
- What does that mean?

03:50.564 --> 03:52.189
I have an appointment
every Wednesday at 10:00.

03:52.274 --> 03:54.817
- I just don't go.
- You've been paying him for four years?

03:54.902 --> 03:56.277
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Thank God.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.529
I have a business manager who does that.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.468
Why don't you read a magazine?

04:20.552 --> 04:23.429
No, I've already read that issue
of Cat Fancy cover to cover

04:23.513 --> 04:26.098
and I'm saving American Stamp Collector
for a long plane ride.

04:26.183 --> 04:27.850
All right.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.352
Why not just go to your regular doctor?

04:29.686 --> 04:31.729
When I go to my internist,
he asks me questions.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.357
It's a half-hour interview
before he puts on a stethoscope.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.359
- What kinds of questions?
- I don't know.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.944
"How you feeling"?

04:38.028 --> 04:39.236
Asshole.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.448
Here, read Vegan Health.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.576
- Will?
- Yeah.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.245
I'm Jack Habib. Come on in.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.539
- Are you Abe's son?
- I am.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.041
Nice to meet you.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.293
- You, too. Come on in.
- Is your dad inside?

04:55.212 --> 04:56.295
No.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.172
I can wait out here.

04:59.174 --> 05:00.758
My father died two years ago

05:00.884 --> 05:02.468
and I took his practice. Come on in.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.428
I'm sorry to hear that.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.889
Wait, what?

05:08.058 --> 05:11.102
Will, I'm Dr. Jacob Habib,

05:11.186 --> 05:13.229
son of Dr. Abraham Habib.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.899
My father passed away
and his patients now see me.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.360
You've been paying me for two years.

05:20.404 --> 05:21.904
Come on in.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.614
How old are you?

05:24.408 --> 05:25.449
I'm 29.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.285
Shut up. Can you write prescriptions?

05:28.996 --> 05:30.413
Yeah. Let's go.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.417
I'll be two minutes.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.213
So if you're 29...

05:39.297 --> 05:40.506
Don't try to count backwards.

05:40.590 --> 05:44.010
I did everything early.
So unless you're certain

05:44.094 --> 05:46.679
you've got a Doogie Howser
joke I haven't heard,

05:46.763 --> 05:49.306
why don't we just assume it
was hilarious and move on?

05:49.391 --> 05:51.100
- Okay.
- So what's going on?

05:51.184 --> 05:53.019
I need something to help me sleep.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.854
- Why?
- I can't sleep.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.274
- Why?
- I don't know.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.651
Any recent change in diet?

06:00.777 --> 06:02.945
I haven't changed my diet since college.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.072
- You should.
- I invented a new sandwich.

06:05.157 --> 06:07.199
Scrambled eggs, bacon,
and melted cheese on toast.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.035
I make two of them every night
before I get into bed.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.911
You invented an Egg McMuffin.

06:11.163 --> 06:12.204
Getting enough exercise?

06:12.289 --> 06:13.581
I have to scramble the eggs.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.374
And other than that?

06:15.459 --> 06:17.877
No. Look, any kind of sleeping pill will do.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.545
Sure.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.922
- Just talk a little bit?
- Oh, God, please, let's not.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.262
- You're still taking Effexor?
- No.

06:28.346 --> 06:29.680
- Clonazepam?
- No.

06:29.765 --> 06:30.931
- Ativan?
- No.

06:31.099 --> 06:34.769
Four years ago, you were on 135mg of Effexor

06:34.853 --> 06:36.812
plus Clonazepam and Ativan at bedtime.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.147
I'm not anymore.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.066
- Why is that?
- I was cured.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.650
These are all antianxiety medications.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.152
And I have no more anxiety.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.570
Except for not being able to sleep.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.739
Right, so if you'll just
give me a prescription for...

06:46.823 --> 06:48.657
Yeah, I'm going to.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.409
- Just a few more questions.
- Okay.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.162
Any extra stress at work?

06:53.330 --> 06:54.663
Extra stress?

06:54.748 --> 06:55.790
- Yeah.
- No.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.501
- No extra stress?
- No.

06:58.794 --> 07:00.336
- One more question.
- Sure.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.214
What are you fucking around with me for?

07:04.049 --> 07:06.759
- I'm sorry?
- What are you fucking around with me for?

07:06.843 --> 07:08.344
I just asked if there's
any extra stress at work,

07:08.428 --> 07:09.887
- and you say...
- There isn't.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.972
There isn't.

07:12.057 --> 07:15.267
- What about the death threat?
- You know about that?

07:15.393 --> 07:16.936
Anyone who reads a newspaper
knows about that.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.979
- It's truly not a big deal.
- No?

07:19.064 --> 07:20.940
Jack, can I get the prescription?

07:21.066 --> 07:23.442
Just tell me how a death threat
isn't a big deal.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.069
I used to be a criminal prosecutor.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.947
And I'm telling you
nobody who's serious about killing you

07:28.031 --> 07:29.615
sends you a note beforehand to warn you.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.742
The gentleman who is with you
in the waiting room,

07:31.827 --> 07:32.827
he's a bodyguard, right?

07:32.911 --> 07:34.286
Yeah, but you shouldn't... That's the...

07:34.371 --> 07:37.081
Our insurance company makes that decision.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.332
Based on what?

07:38.416 --> 07:41.168
They have experts who determine
whether a cret is threadible...

07:41.503 --> 07:42.503
Threat is credible.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.421
And why do they think the threat is credible?

07:44.548 --> 07:46.340
Nine questions ago,
you said one more question.

07:46.424 --> 07:47.716
Why do they think the threat is credible?

07:47.801 --> 07:50.886
Because I changed the rules
of the comment section of our website.

07:51.847 --> 07:54.223
That's all.
I changed the rules of the comment section.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.267
As always, or at least since Monday,

07:56.351 --> 07:59.520
we end our show with your own
viewer comments on our website.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.230
So let's see what we have tonight.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.150
LollypopLollypop says, "30 more seconds

08:04.234 --> 08:07.987
"and you would have had
that self-loathing hypocrite in tears."

08:08.071 --> 08:11.824
That... That was absolutely not my intention.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.410
SurrendrDorothee said,
"Your Log Cabin closet case

08:14.536 --> 08:16.412
"hit the Uncle Tom Daily Double,

08:16.538 --> 08:20.040
"a traitor to his race
and a traitor to his sexual orientation."

08:20.125 --> 08:21.542
Don't blow a gasket.

08:21.626 --> 08:24.503
He's plainly not a closet case.
He's openly gay.

08:24.588 --> 08:28.007
I also think he showed
a lot of courage coming on the show.

08:28.091 --> 08:31.510
Certainly more courage than it takes
to post an anonymous comment on a website.

08:32.596 --> 08:35.181
Terry Smith's coming up from Washington
with The Capitol Report.

08:35.265 --> 08:36.765
I'm Will McAvoy. Good night.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.563
We're out.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.528
- Neal!
- Believe me, those were the best two we had.

08:49.613 --> 08:51.322
Why didn't we just
hit him in the head with a shovel?

08:51.406 --> 08:53.240
- We've got to talk about what just happened.
- I'm trying to.

08:53.325 --> 08:55.367
Not the website. We've gotta talk
about what happened on the air.

08:55.452 --> 08:56.869
- I don't wanna talk.
- Were you outside your body?

08:56.953 --> 08:57.953
I don't want to talk about it.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.748
- I want to talk about the website.
- The website's not the problem right now.

09:00.832 --> 09:03.250
It's my problem right now.
We're putting up these comments...

09:03.335 --> 09:05.044
- We've heard this before.
- But we're still doing it.

09:05.128 --> 09:08.547
It's a trade with Reese.
The page views offset the ratings drop.

09:08.632 --> 09:11.634
Is there any way of knowing
if LollypopLollypop is 10 years old?

09:11.760 --> 09:13.135
Or a basset hound?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.970
The reason basset hounds
have such long ears

09:15.055 --> 09:17.848
is so they can waft up the scent
when they're hunting.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.892
- Is there any way of knowing?
- No.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.977
Is there any way of knowing
if LollypopLollypop

09:22.062 --> 09:24.313
- and SurrendrDorothee are the same person?
- No.

09:24.648 --> 09:26.398
Who posts comments on the Internet more,

09:26.483 --> 09:28.025
people who are content
or people who are incontent?

09:28.109 --> 09:29.193
- Discontent.
- What?

09:29.277 --> 09:30.736
It's discontent, not incontent.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.948
- It's about 30-to-1 incontent.
- Discontent.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.741
Final question. In your wildest dreams,

09:35.825 --> 09:38.661
can you imagine Walter Cronkite
saying "LollypopLollypop"

09:38.745 --> 09:40.454
as many times as I have
in the last 10 minutes?

09:40.538 --> 09:42.790
Not unless he was in
an a cappella doo-wop group, no.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.084
He wasn't. Here's what I'd love.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.835
You want to join the discussion, fine.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.921
I want to know your name, age, occupation,

09:49.005 --> 09:50.965
- and level of education.
- Oh, God.

09:51.049 --> 09:53.592
The thing about the Internet
is it's a populist tool.

09:53.677 --> 09:57.012
Populists have names, too.
William Jennings Bryan, Will Rogers, me.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.264
- Will.
- Unless you're Deep Throat

09:58.348 --> 10:01.308
or in the Witness Protection Program,
anonymity is cowardice.

10:01.393 --> 10:03.602
You're in a mob.
You're lobbing smack from the cheap seats.

10:03.687 --> 10:05.271
Don't we have bigger fish to fry than the...

10:05.355 --> 10:07.314
Yes, but we can fry
more than one fish at a time.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.692
And how could we possibly
verify someone's name,

10:09.776 --> 10:12.611
- age, occupation, and level of education?
- Neal?

10:12.696 --> 10:15.823
We implement
a third-party verification service.

10:15.907 --> 10:17.616
All you had to say was, "We can't,"

10:17.701 --> 10:20.119
- and the conversation would have been over.
- So it is possible?

10:20.203 --> 10:22.579
It's what the IRS uses
when you're filing online.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.290
Talk to me, Tonto.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.166
- I can do it if you want.
- I want.

10:26.251 --> 10:29.086
Won't the result be that nobody posts
comments on our website anymore?

10:29.170 --> 10:32.089
First of all, oh no. What will we do
without feedback from SurrendrDorothee?

10:32.215 --> 10:36.051
And second, the result will be our website
will ghettoize every other website.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.429
The result will be civility in the public square

10:38.513 --> 10:39.763
and a triumph of populism.

10:39.848 --> 10:42.558
I'm going to single-handedly fix the Internet.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.893
- What could possibly go wrong?
- Will!

10:44.978 --> 10:47.479
- What?
- We have to talk about what just happened.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.398
No, we don't. We're just gonna move on.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.485
And when did you get the death threat?

10:53.570 --> 10:56.697
I don't know.
A day after the mosque interview.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.700
We know that an Islamic trend
is to build large mosques

10:59.784 --> 11:02.244
on the cherished sites of conquered lands.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.955
- You're talking about Cordoba.
- That's exactly right.

11:05.040 --> 11:08.500
When Muslims conquered Cordoba, Spain,
they tore down churches

11:08.585 --> 11:11.337
and synagogues
and put mosques in their place.

11:11.421 --> 11:14.548
Ms. Greer, Muslims conquered Cordoba
in the year 712.

11:14.632 --> 11:18.677
Do you think we can call something
that last happened in the 8th century a trend?

11:18.762 --> 11:21.013
She'll say,
"Why does it have to be at Ground Zero?"

11:21.097 --> 11:23.349
Anyone being honest about
the prospect of a mosque

11:23.433 --> 11:27.895
being built so close to Ground Zero
would say it instinctually feels wrong.

11:28.063 --> 11:30.022
Is it legal? Of course it is.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.483
Is it wrong? Of course it is.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.651
It should be built somewhere
where the 9/11 families

11:34.736 --> 11:38.030
don't have to feel the agony of having
a shrine to their loved ones stomped upon.

11:38.114 --> 11:41.700
All over America
we're seeing the influence of creeping Islam.

11:41.993 --> 11:42.993
We are?

11:43.119 --> 11:44.995
What about those
who would impose Sharia law?

11:45.080 --> 11:47.498
Women can be stoned to death
for committing adultery.

11:47.582 --> 11:48.624
No, they can't.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.043
Actual laws are the only laws
that are enforceable,

11:51.127 --> 11:53.921
including the one that says
you can't create religious laws.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.507
And the US is in no more danger
of coming under Sharia law

11:56.591 --> 11:58.008
than it is the rules of Fight Club.

11:58.093 --> 11:59.301
Let me ask you something.

11:59.386 --> 12:03.847
Muslims the world over are fighting a civil war
over the direction Islam is taking.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.350
Are you going to be stationed
at the door of that mosque

12:06.434 --> 12:08.394
to turn radicals away?

12:08.478 --> 12:10.604
Can you guarantee that the current imam

12:10.688 --> 12:13.065
is going to be the same
imam 10 years from now?

12:13.149 --> 12:16.235
It's worth pointing out that it's not a mosque.
It's a community center.

12:16.319 --> 12:18.112
I'm not sure why you think
that makes it better.

12:18.196 --> 12:21.365
What business does a community center have
in the religion business?

12:21.449 --> 12:23.158
And then pivot to the larger point.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.286
I want the art and graphics reviewed
three times before air.

12:26.371 --> 12:28.080
Ms. Greer, you mentioned creeping Islam.

12:28.164 --> 12:31.041
Are you concerned about
creeping Christianity?

12:31.126 --> 12:33.043
Only that it's not creeping fast enough.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.421
Okay, here are some
things done on American soil

12:35.505 --> 12:37.172
in the name of Christianity.

12:37.507 --> 12:40.050
The Ku Klux Klan burned
down black churches,

12:40.135 --> 12:43.554
raped women, murdered civil rights workers,
murdered children,

12:43.638 --> 12:46.265
and terrorized communities
for over a century.

12:46.349 --> 12:51.228
The neo-Nazis all acted and continue to act
in the name of white Christian supremacy.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.647
The Army of God
fatally attacks abortion clinics

12:53.731 --> 12:55.357
and doctors across the country.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.693
The Covenant, The Sword,
and The Arm of the Lord

12:57.777 --> 12:59.862
targets local police and federal agents.

13:00.363 --> 13:02.406
The federal building in Oklahoma City,

13:02.490 --> 13:04.783
the attempted assassination
of Ronald Reagan,

13:04.868 --> 13:07.786
and the successful assassinations
of Martin Luther King,

13:07.871 --> 13:09.746
John F. Kennedy,

13:09.831 --> 13:11.707
John Lennon,

13:11.791 --> 13:12.916
and Abraham Lincoln,

13:13.001 --> 13:14.960
all perpetrated by Christians.

13:15.044 --> 13:18.464
Ms. Greer, we weren't attacked by Muslims.
We were attacked by sociopaths.

13:18.548 --> 13:22.801
And I, for one, would join you in protesting
a community center for the criminally insane.

13:22.886 --> 13:26.513
But no one is suggesting building one.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.348
Here's the thing about the Japanese.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.976
Where we tend to hype things up,
they go the other direction.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.020
You think they're lowballing Fukushima?

13:33.104 --> 13:34.313
I don't know anything about nuclear reactors,

13:34.397 --> 13:36.023
and I'm not at all involved in this story.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.817
I'm just saying I wouldn't
take their word for it it's a level five.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.778
Excuse me, Will. There's a comment
on your website you need to see.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.448
Now I get to say who is it from?
What do they do?

13:44.532 --> 13:45.657
It's serious.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.334
From about 25 minutes ago.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.171
"Fucking sand niggers
should get herded and slaughtered.

13:59.255 --> 14:02.466
"I've got a bullet for you, too.
You think I'm fucking around?

14:03.343 --> 14:04.885
"2 Hudson Street, 27."

14:04.969 --> 14:07.513
- Is 2 Hudson 27...
- It's my address and apartment number.

14:07.597 --> 14:10.474
Alice Cynkar, an English professor at OSU.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.683
It wasn't written by an English professor,

14:11.768 --> 14:13.310
and it wasn't written by Alice Cynkar.

14:13.436 --> 14:15.354
How much effort does it take
to scam the new system?

14:15.438 --> 14:16.563
You've got to want it pretty bad.

14:16.648 --> 14:17.856
Millie, it's MacKenzie.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.983
Would you tell him we're
coming right up, please?

14:22.654 --> 14:24.530
They could have stolen her password.

14:24.614 --> 14:26.740
- How hard is that?
- Hard.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.951
We implemented complex
password requirements on the site

14:29.035 --> 14:32.037
because we knew it was catnip
for some sophomore at MIT.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.873
It would take an average computer
57 days to get in.

14:34.958 --> 14:36.375
And that's with someone
who knows what they're doing.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.293
How many days has the new system been up?

14:38.795 --> 14:40.128
- Three.
- Jesus.

14:40.463 --> 14:41.713
- Will...
- Everybody relax.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.049
Neal just said it.
It's a college kid pledging a frat.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.509
With a death threat? No.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.136
Charlie, I want a body on him
until this guy's in handcuffs.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.888
- No way.
- You're not gonna have a choice.

14:49.973 --> 14:52.349
- The insurance company makes that call.
- Come on.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.102
Listen to me.
This goes to AWM security right now.

14:55.186 --> 14:57.229
Security's got to show it
to the insurance company.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.565
And that's going to trigger
some kind of protection.

14:59.649 --> 15:02.401
Wouldn't it make more sense for me
just to wear a different disguise every day?

15:02.485 --> 15:03.735
One more thing.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.696
There's gonna be a tabloid story.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.614
- Good. Yeah.
- What did I do?

15:07.699 --> 15:10.659
Is it possible Maggie
filed a complaint with HR

15:10.743 --> 15:12.995
saying that you created
a hostile work environment?

15:13.079 --> 15:14.121
No, it's not possible.

15:14.205 --> 15:16.081
Maggie wouldn't complain
if her hair was on fire.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.332
Someone else did on her behalf.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.501
And it was a while ago before you got here.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.295
Thanks.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.422
Would you excuse us for a second?

15:23.840 --> 15:25.507
Sure.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.885
Why don't we try to fully investigate
the anatomy of these stories?

15:28.970 --> 15:31.513
- No, we're gonna fully investigate Will.
- Of course.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.683
I want you to assign a team
to do opposition research on Will.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.185
Let's call it
Operation Involuntary Colonoscopy.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.647
I just want to know what the next
tabloid story is before it happens.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.899
You won't be able to pin
nothing on me, Mugsy.

15:42.984 --> 15:45.402
'Cause I've lived my life
straight as the Kingston Trio.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.446
I'm not fucking around!

15:47.530 --> 15:50.532
You know, when you're grumpier than I am,
we've switched roles.

15:51.242 --> 15:53.285
Ask him what's the current
state of the reactors.

16:00.835 --> 16:01.835
What did he say?

16:05.882 --> 16:08.050
- What did he say?
- His daughter's on the diving team.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.510
They came in second at regionals.

16:10.595 --> 16:13.513
- Did he understand the question?
- Did you?

16:14.182 --> 16:16.224
I haven't spoken to him in two years.
We're catching up.

16:16.392 --> 16:19.353
How does a company like TEPCO not have
a spokesperson who speaks English?

16:20.313 --> 16:22.648
- I don't know.
- What is the current state of the reactors?

16:22.899 --> 16:24.191
Tanaka-san...

16:34.702 --> 16:37.371
Units one and three have had explosions
due to hydrogen buildup.

16:37.455 --> 16:39.498
They're currently stable,
but they're not safe to enter.

16:39.582 --> 16:42.042
What are they doing to contain the situation?

16:46.506 --> 16:48.799
- What's going on with Will?
- Internal security is handling it.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.634
But I have to give you a rotten assignment.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.511
- You got gum in your hair again?
- No.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.471
Yes, but I got it out.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.598
I need you to do opposition research on Will.

16:57.392 --> 16:58.850
- Seriously?
- About a year ago,

16:58.935 --> 17:01.269
somebody filed a complaint with HR
on your behalf.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.897
I know what that was.
Will didn't do anything wrong.

17:03.981 --> 17:05.148
- This is ridiculous.
- I know,

17:05.233 --> 17:07.401
but Charlie wants to know
what else is out there so he can...

17:07.485 --> 17:08.610
- Will knows we're doing this?
- Of course.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.153
- And he's okay with it?
- No, he hates it.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.197
- Fantastic.
- Go to work.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.284
- Have you done this before?
- Yeah.

17:16.411 --> 17:17.994
Where do we start?

17:18.079 --> 17:19.413
Tell me about the complaint.

17:20.123 --> 17:23.333
There was a desk producer
who saw Will yell at me about something.

17:23.418 --> 17:25.544
- What?
- Doesn't matter.

17:26.337 --> 17:27.921
What?

17:28.464 --> 17:29.589
Doesn't matter.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.681
- I mixed up Georgia the state with...
- No.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.516
- Yes, Georgia the country.
- And this was...

17:39.600 --> 17:41.351
- Yup. This isn't about me.
...during the invasion?

17:41.436 --> 17:43.395
You thought the Russians invaded Atlanta?

17:43.479 --> 17:45.230
In retrospect, it seems farfetched.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.649
But that wasn't what
he was actually mad about.

17:48.317 --> 17:51.403
The wife of a board member died
and Will asked me to send flowers.

17:51.487 --> 17:55.699
I wrote on the card,
"I'm so sorry about your loss. LOL."

17:56.117 --> 17:58.994
- LOL?
- I thought it meant "lots of love."

17:59.495 --> 18:01.037
How are you still working here?

18:02.206 --> 18:03.582
I dodge bullets.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.667
Here comes a bullet. Boom! I'm over here.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.837
Ping! Here comes another bullet.
Boom! I'm over here.

18:12.383 --> 18:15.677
Ask him if TEPCO's gonna try
to keep the reactors going.

18:15.762 --> 18:16.845
Tanaka-san...

18:28.191 --> 18:29.357
They're classified at level five

18:29.442 --> 18:31.026
and they think they'll be able
to get the reactor going.

18:38.034 --> 18:40.327
Guys, do me a favor and let us have a minute?

18:56.344 --> 19:00.806
Daisuke, the others have left the room
and I'm alone now.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.058
I understand.

19:03.226 --> 19:07.103
Do you still want to stand by your statement
that the reactor's going to stay at level 5?

19:08.898 --> 19:10.899
That is the statement that I made.

19:11.234 --> 19:16.988
Daisuke, are people in the area
in more danger than you're telling us?

19:17.615 --> 19:22.577
I'm not an expert in this field.
I'm just a spokesperson for TEPCO.

19:23.246 --> 19:26.623
Have you heard anyone talk about
the radiation exceeding level 5?

19:31.045 --> 19:35.382
Daisuke, we've known each other a long time.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.592
Anybody know where Sloan Sabbith is?

19:38.761 --> 19:40.011
Sloan!

19:40.096 --> 19:41.304
She's on the phone.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.349
All right, she's off the phone.

19:47.770 --> 19:50.063
Here are the notes.
It's gonna go to level seven.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.940
- Holy shit.
- You got a minute?

19:52.316 --> 19:53.859
Fukushima's a lot worse
than they're telling you.

19:53.943 --> 19:56.403
- I need you to fill in for Elliot tonight.
- This is what the Japanese do.

19:56.487 --> 19:57.529
They... Wait, what?

19:57.613 --> 19:59.698
- I need you to fill in for Elliot at 10:00.
- Why?

19:59.782 --> 20:01.366
His 5-year-old's having a tonsillectomy today.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.118
Elliot's gonna spend the night
in the hospital with her.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.704
- Was it an emergency?
- No, it was scheduled a week ago.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.205
And you're just getting around to this now?

20:07.290 --> 20:08.415
I...

20:08.499 --> 20:09.958
- Forgot?
- Yes.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.043
You have a staff.
They can write these things down.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.713
They can, but I have to
remember to tell them to.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.798
So what do you say?
You're my first and only choice.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.884
- What about Jerome?
- He's in Bermuda.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.969
- Kathy?
- It's her parents' 50th anniversary.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.137
- Taylor?
- Bronchitis.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.889
- So...
- Yes, you were my fourth and only choice.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.891
I can't host Elliot's show. Don't be ridiculous.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.392
You host your own show at 4:00.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.436
- About financial news.
- You're expanding.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.647
Come on. I gained four freaking pounds.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.482
No, professor.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.860
- Right, expanding.
- Yeah.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.030
- No, I'm not doing it.
- Your copy will be written for you to approve.

20:40.114 --> 20:42.073
You've got Marco Rubio, Sandra Bernhard...

20:42.158 --> 20:43.909
Sandra Bernhard's been dead for 100 years.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.827
- That's Sarah Bernhardt.
- She'd be a good guest.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.120
- I hate my life.
- Hmm?

20:47.204 --> 20:49.581
Nothing. And the spokesperson for TEPCO.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.791
- I just got off the phone with him.
- See? You're perfect.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.919
I was just doing a favor for these guys.
I don't know anything...

20:54.003 --> 20:56.254
Thank God my first five
choices weren't available.

20:56.339 --> 20:57.505
I thought there were only three.

20:57.757 --> 20:58.965
Let's not get caught up in the math.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.967
If you want a wardrobe change after the 4:00,

21:01.052 --> 21:03.178
we have Gucci ready to
send over some choices.

21:03.554 --> 21:06.264
- Gucci?
- A whole rack of choices.

21:06.349 --> 21:08.767
Your copy will be ready
for your approval after 9:00

21:08.851 --> 21:12.270
along with your questions,
and I will be in your ear the whole time.

21:12.438 --> 21:14.564
Except for Fukushima,
you're mostly throwing to packages.

21:14.649 --> 21:16.066
They've been lowballing the radiation levels.

21:16.150 --> 21:17.108
I'd take their word for it.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.610
The Japanese have
some experience with radiation.

21:18.694 --> 21:19.778
You think that's something...

21:19.862 --> 21:22.989
That is not something
you should mention on the air.

21:28.037 --> 21:30.163
- Oh, God.
- Mr. Will McAvoy.

21:30.247 --> 21:31.957
You're not here to do my taxes, right?

21:32.041 --> 21:33.208
My name's Lonny Church.

21:33.584 --> 21:36.211
Mr. Horn at AWM Security
told you I'd be here at this time.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.712
I'll tell you right now I'm gonna hate this.

21:37.838 --> 21:39.214
I'll tell you now I'm not gonna care.

21:39.340 --> 21:41.716
- Let's go in my office for a minute.
- Sure.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.260
It's not a real threat.

21:44.345 --> 21:46.763
I don't make that decision.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.307
Lonny Church? Did you play college football?

21:49.392 --> 21:51.726
Yes, I did. Defensive tackle.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.979
- Started three years for Clemson.
- And then?

21:54.063 --> 21:56.022
Got drafted in the eighth round
by the Bengals.

21:56.107 --> 21:58.775
- And then?
- Got cut five weeks into training camp.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.485
Excellent.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.362
Joined the Army, became an MP.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.948
- Where were you deployed?
- New Jersey.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.741
You see a lot of action in New Jersey?

22:06.826 --> 22:08.284
See a lot of action in your studio?

22:08.369 --> 22:09.869
I'll be doing the jokes, okay?

22:09.954 --> 22:12.497
- After you were discharged?
- Honorably.

22:12.581 --> 22:13.915
I joined Blue North Security.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.251
Who else's body have you guarded?

22:16.335 --> 22:17.752
- We don't talk about that.
- Okay.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.963
Kanye. It was awesome.

22:20.047 --> 22:21.381
Are you armed?

22:21.465 --> 22:23.800
I secure my weapon in a gun safe
when I come in the building.

22:24.135 --> 22:26.553
Keep it there.
I really don't want an armed guard.

22:26.637 --> 22:29.514
Maybe if you were drafted
in the first four rounds, I'd feel safer.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.391
- Mr. McAvoy...
- You can call me Will.

22:31.475 --> 22:32.642
Yeah, I was gonna do that anyway.

22:32.935 --> 22:34.394
I know you're used to being the boss.

22:34.770 --> 22:37.439
But you're not anymore.
At least for a little while.

22:37.565 --> 22:38.648
How long?

22:38.733 --> 22:40.734
Until my colleagues chase down
the source of the threat

22:40.818 --> 22:43.361
or, of course, if you've been
successfully assassinated.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.864
- A joke?
- What'd you think?

22:46.615 --> 22:48.575
It was all right. How does this work?

22:48.659 --> 22:51.536
I pick you up at your home in the morning
and escort you to your office.

22:51.620 --> 22:54.414
Then I pick you up at your office at night
and escort you to your home.

22:54.498 --> 22:56.916
I'm with you any place
that's an unsecured area.

22:57.001 --> 22:58.501
What's an unsecured area?

22:58.586 --> 23:00.670
Any place that isn't your home or your office.

23:01.756 --> 23:03.089
I'm single. What about a date?

23:03.424 --> 23:05.300
I don't think we should
get romantically involved.

23:05.468 --> 23:07.552
You get one joke a day.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.012
- Come on in.
- I say that.

23:09.972 --> 23:11.639
- I'm sorry. You got a second?
- Yeah.

23:11.974 --> 23:12.974
I'll leave you.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.851
Sloan, this is Lonny. You'll see him around.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.645
- Good to meet you.
- Wow.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.482
- Can I tap your chest?
- Sure.

23:21.984 --> 23:24.360
Holy cow.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.072
- Have you felt his pecs?
- No, I haven't yet.

23:27.156 --> 23:29.240
I'll be downstairs.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.161
So I'm hosting Elliot's show tonight.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.829
I know. I'm the one who suggested you.

23:35.873 --> 23:37.040
You really think I can do it?

23:37.124 --> 23:40.001
No, I have no idea. So we're gonna find out.

23:40.294 --> 23:43.046
All right. Well, your exuberant
confidence notwithstanding,

23:43.130 --> 23:45.882
- I have the spokesperson...
- From TEPCO, I know.

23:46.008 --> 23:48.259
He just told me, off the record,
that reactor three

23:48.344 --> 23:51.763
is causing what is a level seven,
not a level five, radiation leak.

23:52.056 --> 23:54.307
What's the trick to getting him to
say it on the record?

23:54.391 --> 23:57.352
There is no trick.
You just don't stop until he tells the truth.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.437
What do you mean you don't stop?

23:59.522 --> 24:00.522
I mean you don't stop.

24:00.606 --> 24:03.775
Sloan, I watch your show
at 4:00 and you're brilliant.

24:03.859 --> 24:06.611
But you let guests
say things that I know you know aren't true.

24:06.695 --> 24:09.864
And then you just move on.
Ask the damn follow-up

24:09.949 --> 24:12.408
and then demonstrate with facts
how the guest is lying.

24:12.493 --> 24:14.119
You can't just sit there and be a facilitator

24:14.203 --> 24:16.788
for whatever bullshit
the guest wants to feed your viewers.

24:16.872 --> 24:19.499
They're not coming on to plug a movie.
It's not Jimmy Kimmel.

24:19.583 --> 24:22.544
You knowingly, passively,
allow someone to lie on your air,

24:22.920 --> 24:25.213
and maybe you're not a drug dealer,
but you're sure as hell

24:25.297 --> 24:28.258
the guy who drives the dealer
around in your car.

24:28.342 --> 24:30.677
So maybe you'll get it, maybe you won't.
Show me something.

24:33.389 --> 24:35.014
- Got it.
- Do you?

24:36.725 --> 24:37.767
Yeah.

24:40.271 --> 24:42.438
I just... I don't know.
I was in a bad mood.

24:43.107 --> 24:45.150
Honestly, I was just trying to motivate her.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.610
She's the last person who needs motivation,

24:47.695 --> 24:49.904
- so it just ended up...
- Scaring her.

24:51.740 --> 24:52.991
I hate that people are scared of me.

24:53.075 --> 24:55.034
- I absolutely hate it.
- Why?

24:55.744 --> 24:57.495
Why do I hate when people are scared of me?

24:57.580 --> 24:59.247
For the same reason everybody does.

24:59.540 --> 25:01.040
Everybody doesn't.

25:01.125 --> 25:03.543
Some people like it. Most people don't care.

25:03.961 --> 25:06.421
I don't know what to tell you. I don't like it.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.089
And I'm pretty sure I scared Sloan

25:08.174 --> 25:11.843
because she's a veteran reporter
who's never done anything like what she did.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.303
What's the condition of each reactor?

25:18.684 --> 25:22.187
- All six reactors are in stable condition.
- Great, let's wrap up.

25:22.271 --> 25:24.022
What about the partial meltdown
at reactor three?

25:24.106 --> 25:26.524
Wrap up for me.

25:26.609 --> 25:28.151
Excuse me, that's not what I asked.

25:28.444 --> 25:29.569
I'm asking him specifically

25:29.653 --> 25:31.362
about the core damage at reactor three.

25:31.447 --> 25:34.073
What's happening?

25:38.204 --> 25:40.872
We know of no core damage
at any of the reactors.

25:40.956 --> 25:42.457
That's not what Mr. Tanaka just said.

25:42.791 --> 25:45.543
He said, "Our engineers
can't get close enough to confirm that."

25:45.628 --> 25:47.420
Please translate exactly what I'm asking

25:47.504 --> 25:49.047
and exactly what Mr. Tanaka is answering,

25:49.131 --> 25:50.506
including what I'm saying now,

25:50.591 --> 25:52.967
because I want him to be aware
that he's being misrepresented.

25:53.427 --> 25:56.763
Miss Sabbith, I am translating.
He is not being...

25:56.847 --> 25:59.182
Ask him if he believes
the radiation levels are going to a seven.

25:59.475 --> 26:02.268
Please, please, don't go rogue.

26:07.775 --> 26:10.693
The radiation was categorized at level four

26:10.903 --> 26:13.071
and then recategorized at level five.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.822
And that's where it should remain.

26:15.491 --> 26:18.243
Ma'am, he didn't say that's
where it should remain. You did.

26:18.661 --> 26:20.912
Furthermore, he told me...
You know what? I'm just gonna...

26:20.996 --> 26:23.873
Tanaka-san...

26:27.086 --> 26:29.837
And now we're doing
the broadcast in Japanese.

26:37.388 --> 26:38.680
"We'll be right back after this." Just say that.

26:40.641 --> 26:41.849
Say it in English.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.853
Did she just... Put me back!

26:45.938 --> 26:48.147
Mr. Tanaka, your company
had this incident rated at level four,

26:48.232 --> 26:49.816
then adjusted to level five.

26:49.900 --> 26:52.443
How confident are you
that that'll be the highest level we see?

26:52.528 --> 26:53.820
At least we're back to English.

26:57.908 --> 26:59.909
At this point, we see no reason

26:59.994 --> 27:01.744
that level will need future escalation.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.539
Well, that's simply not what Mr. Tanaka
told me on the phone earlier today.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.749
- No, no.
- When I spoke with him earlier,

27:06.834 --> 27:09.127
he said there's enough evidence
to raise the level to seven.

27:09.211 --> 27:11.587
- Go back to Japanese.
- And now he's not saying it, so I am.

27:11.672 --> 27:13.631
- Oh, my God!
- So there it is.

27:13.716 --> 27:15.300
The Fukushima nuclear power plant is saying

27:15.384 --> 27:17.844
that the level four radiation leak
that was raised to level five

27:18.345 --> 27:20.221
has a chance of being raised to level seven,

27:20.306 --> 27:22.515
which is the difference
between life and gruesome death.

27:23.726 --> 27:25.476
We'll be back after this with Sarah Bernhardt.

27:25.561 --> 27:27.228
Sandra Bernhard, you idiot!

27:27.313 --> 27:29.063
What the hell does it matter?

27:47.541 --> 27:49.292
- Okay...
- 'Sup?

27:49.752 --> 27:52.962
Okay, I know we were on
sketchy ground ethically

27:53.589 --> 27:54.964
and linguistically, but...

27:55.049 --> 27:57.884
Whatever you're gonna say,
save it for another 10 seconds.

27:58.260 --> 27:59.344
What happens in 10 seconds?

27:59.428 --> 28:00.845
Just hang on for another five seconds

28:00.929 --> 28:03.014
and know that we've all been there
at one point or another.

28:03.098 --> 28:04.182
What happens in five seconds?

28:04.266 --> 28:07.518
What in the name of holy fuck
were you thinking about?

28:07.603 --> 28:09.771
First, let me say
that Don was not responsible for that.

28:09.855 --> 28:12.565
Yeah, when you severed
communication with the EP,

28:12.649 --> 28:14.942
you pretty much absolved
him of responsibility.

28:15.027 --> 28:18.154
But that doesn't make the cut
of the top three calamities

28:18.238 --> 28:19.697
- that just occurred.
- Charlie...

28:19.782 --> 28:22.950
I, along with most people
who don't live in Japan,

28:23.035 --> 28:25.870
am not fluent in Japanese, so I have to ask.

28:26.038 --> 28:30.291
Did you just make up statements
for somebody we had live on our air?

28:30.376 --> 28:33.503
- I didn't make them up.
- About a deadly radiation leak?

28:33.587 --> 28:35.004
I didn't make them up.

28:35.089 --> 28:37.173
He told me the reactor was going to a seven.

28:37.257 --> 28:39.217
When? Tonight?

28:39.885 --> 28:42.720
I'm asking honestly
because there was a portion

28:42.805 --> 28:45.848
of the broadcast that turned
into a Kurosawa movie.

28:45.933 --> 28:48.309
These things are measured
on a scale of zero to seven.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.770
Five is Three Mile Island,
seven is Chernobyl.

28:50.854 --> 28:53.981
On air, did he say
the reactors were going to seven?

28:54.066 --> 28:55.316
He said it to me in the preinterview.

28:55.401 --> 28:56.901
And then the company stuck
an interpreter next to him,

28:56.985 --> 28:58.569
and I think her job was more than interpreting

28:58.654 --> 28:59.779
because she wasn't accurately translating...

28:59.863 --> 29:02.448
We don't report what you think, Sloan.

29:02.533 --> 29:05.743
The guy said all six reactors are stable.

29:06.453 --> 29:08.162
The Japanese are a deferential people.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.581
It's very hard for them to explain
when they've done something wrong.

29:10.666 --> 29:13.167
I don't give a shit, Madame Butterfly!

29:13.502 --> 29:15.169
And right now the Japanese,

29:15.254 --> 29:17.588
who are reading
an online report of your report,

29:17.673 --> 29:19.424
are fleeing from their fucking homes.

29:19.508 --> 29:22.552
Now tell me what he said tonight on air.

29:31.019 --> 29:33.062
He said the reactors were at five.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.399
But you said he said
they would move to seven.

29:36.483 --> 29:38.443
I made it clear he said that
during the preinterview.

29:38.527 --> 29:40.069
First of all, let's not kid ourselves.

29:40.154 --> 29:42.530
There was nothing that was
clear about that interview.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.991
He said it to me, and he said it to
a conference room full of staffers.

29:45.075 --> 29:47.493
- The staffers weren't there.
- The staffers were not there.

29:47.578 --> 29:50.246
I sent them out so we could
speak privately and off...

29:51.748 --> 29:54.667
No, finish that sentence.

29:55.919 --> 29:57.378
Off the record.

29:57.463 --> 30:00.381
Good luck trying to get a source
to talk to you off the record again.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.342
You have no value to me as a reporter now.

30:03.427 --> 30:05.720
- Charlie!
- And I have to suspend you.

30:05.804 --> 30:06.804
- Come on.
- What?

30:06.889 --> 30:10.725
I have to suspend you
while we bring in outside investigators

30:10.809 --> 30:14.020
to comb through every report
you've filed in the last two years

30:14.104 --> 30:15.688
to find out what other shit you made up.

30:15.898 --> 30:18.649
I didn't make anything up.
I would never make anything up.

30:18.734 --> 30:21.444
I know that and you know that
and he knows that,

30:21.528 --> 30:23.321
but why the hell should
anyone else know that?

30:23.739 --> 30:25.072
You're suspended with pay until I figure out...

30:25.157 --> 30:27.575
- They were lying about a public safety issue.
- You're suspended with...

30:27.659 --> 30:29.327
I don't want the goddamn pay!

30:29.411 --> 30:30.995
Don't front off with me, girl!

30:31.079 --> 30:34.248
- Don't call me girl, sir.
- Hey!

30:35.042 --> 30:38.419
Everybody calm the fuck down.

30:49.348 --> 30:52.850
Sarah Bernhardt was a turn-of-the-century

30:52.935 --> 30:55.937
stage and film actress from France.

30:56.271 --> 30:59.023
Sandra Bernhard is a...

30:59.858 --> 31:01.776
I don't know what the hell.

31:31.306 --> 31:35.017
There's no way she does that
if I hadn't given her my awesome pep talk.

31:35.143 --> 31:36.686
Are you close with Sloan?

31:36.812 --> 31:38.187
- Are we close?
- Yeah.

31:38.313 --> 31:39.897
- Why?
- Just asking.

31:39.982 --> 31:41.732
You seem very protective.

31:41.817 --> 31:45.236
We didn't used to be. But she's become...
I don't know.

31:45.320 --> 31:48.114
I don't know,
like a little sister to me or something.

31:49.658 --> 31:51.075
Your father was an abusive alcoholic?

31:51.952 --> 31:52.952
What?

31:53.036 --> 31:56.080
Your father, he was an abusive alcoholic?

31:56.999 --> 31:58.040
I didn't say that.

31:58.667 --> 31:59.750
But he was, right?

32:01.003 --> 32:03.421
You got that in the 40 minutes

32:03.505 --> 32:05.506
that I've been sitting
here that seem like a week and a half?

32:05.591 --> 32:07.008
It's in the notes my dad left.

32:07.092 --> 32:08.884
Can I have a prescription now?

32:08.969 --> 32:10.428
- He hit you?
- Come on.

32:10.512 --> 32:11.512
He hit you, right?

32:12.180 --> 32:13.848
How many times did you
see Good Will Hunting?

32:14.141 --> 32:15.975
- He hit you?
- Yes.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.311
- He hit your mother?
- Yes.

32:18.395 --> 32:21.439
You have a brother and two sisters.
He hit them, right?

32:21.523 --> 32:24.275
Look, he didn't hit anybody
once I was old enough to hit him back.

32:24.359 --> 32:26.193
And when was that?

32:26.695 --> 32:31.073
Will, how old were you
when you had to protect

32:31.158 --> 32:33.784
your mother, your brother,

32:34.453 --> 32:36.329
and your two little sisters

32:36.788 --> 32:39.749
from a grown man
who was drunk and violent?

32:44.671 --> 32:46.839
Fifth grade.

32:46.923 --> 32:49.592
I cracked a bottle of Dewar's across his face.

32:52.763 --> 32:55.056
It's in your notes.
Why are you pursuing this line of...

32:55.140 --> 32:57.058
I'm not trying to be an asshole.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.976
I just want a sleeping pill.

32:59.061 --> 33:01.354
I'm gonna give you one,
but I doubt it's gonna work.

33:01.438 --> 33:02.563
Let's give it a try.

33:03.774 --> 33:06.942
You've got another
15 minutes on your session.

33:07.027 --> 33:08.277
I didn't come here for a session.

33:08.362 --> 33:10.863
You could have gotten sleeping pills
from your internist.

33:10.947 --> 33:12.114
Shit, you could have got them online.

33:12.199 --> 33:15.159
I didn't go to my internist
because he asks too many questions.

33:15.243 --> 33:18.120
You didn't go to your internist because
he doesn't ask you the right questions.

33:18.205 --> 33:19.497
I didn't come here for a session.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.832
I think you did.

33:29.049 --> 33:30.925
I'm checking on the opposition research.

33:31.259 --> 33:34.470
Maggie was detained by the police
for attempting to blow up her parents' house.

33:34.554 --> 33:35.763
He's overstating it.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.932
My cousins and I wanted
to shoot guns at soda cans.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.600
Where did you place the soda cans?

33:39.685 --> 33:41.977
- On top of the propane tanks.
- Which were in front of?

33:42.062 --> 33:44.730
The diesel fuel combine.
But I'm an excellent shot.

33:44.815 --> 33:46.691
The Deep South could have used you
when the Russians invaded.

33:46.775 --> 33:49.652
Will! How's the opposition research on Will?

33:49.736 --> 33:52.738
He once needed lenses for driving,
then didn't.

33:52.823 --> 33:54.407
So he probably had LASIK surgery.

33:54.616 --> 33:55.700
He did.

33:55.784 --> 33:58.536
He registered for the New York Marathon,
but didn't finish.

33:58.620 --> 34:01.038
My fault.
I twisted my ankle at the starting line.

34:01.123 --> 34:02.915
He carried me to the first aid tent. What else?

34:03.208 --> 34:06.210
- He was hospitalized with tuberculosis.
- Already knew that.

34:06.294 --> 34:10.005
He was credited on a country album
as a guitarist.

34:10.090 --> 34:12.758
He's an accomplished guitarist
who occasionally jams with Leonard Cohen.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.720
He got a C-minus in Sociology of Emotion.

34:15.804 --> 34:18.556
It was a clerical mistake.
He never registered for the class.

34:18.640 --> 34:21.016
- Then a C-minus is pretty good.
- I need something I can use.

34:21.101 --> 34:23.394
Wait, are we trying to protect Will
or give you ammunition?

34:23.687 --> 34:24.937
Thought we could do both.

34:25.021 --> 34:28.482
He contributed $250 to
the failed primary campaign

34:28.567 --> 34:30.526
of a congressional candidate in Nebraska.

34:30.610 --> 34:32.486
- While he was a journalist?
- No.

34:32.654 --> 34:33.946
Nothing I can do with that.

34:34.030 --> 34:36.574
I mean, they... Nothing they can do with that.

34:36.658 --> 34:38.200
The candidate was a Republican.

34:38.285 --> 34:39.410
- So's Will.
- What?

34:39.494 --> 34:40.745
He's a registered Republican.

34:40.829 --> 34:42.830
The four of you weren't able to uncover that?

34:43.915 --> 34:46.751
- We weren't looking.
- He was a speechwriter for Bush 41.

34:46.835 --> 34:47.960
What did you think he was?

34:48.044 --> 34:49.587
I just thought he did that as a public service.

34:49.671 --> 34:51.797
Or to mess with him like in The Sting.

34:51.882 --> 34:54.508
That's nothing like
what happened in The Sting.

34:54.593 --> 34:56.844
Jim got kicked out of
a study abroad semester.

34:56.928 --> 34:59.430
- He went to the Arctic Circle.
- I wanted to see the penguins.

34:59.514 --> 35:01.348
- Those are in the Antarctic.
- Lesson learned.

35:01.433 --> 35:02.767
Why'd you get kicked out?

35:02.851 --> 35:06.145
You're not allowed to fraternize with the Inuit.

35:06.229 --> 35:08.272
He tried to score with an Eskimo.

35:08.356 --> 35:09.940
I was just trying...

35:11.234 --> 35:13.402
I was just trying to get past
the disappointment with the penguins.

35:13.487 --> 35:16.906
All right, so there's nothing so far.

35:17.199 --> 35:19.200
Fox offered him a ton of money in 2006

35:19.284 --> 35:20.993
to come to LA and get into late-night.

35:21.077 --> 35:22.119
- A talk show?
- Yeah.

35:22.204 --> 35:24.163
He'd have been good at that.

35:24.498 --> 35:26.832
All right, get back to the news.

35:32.297 --> 35:34.298
- Did you say 2006?
- Yeah.

35:34.382 --> 35:36.217
- How far did it get?
- A deal memo.

35:36.301 --> 35:37.468
- You sure?
- Yeah.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.179
All right.

35:41.515 --> 35:43.390
You know that this is stupid.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.184
Just go do your jobs.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.331
I've just heard something I can't believe.

36:07.415 --> 36:08.541
Why don't you attack this woman?

36:08.834 --> 36:10.251
She doesn't seem that threatening to me.

36:10.335 --> 36:11.418
She's incredibly threatening.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.462
My life is in constant danger
when she's around.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.506
- I'm Lonny Church.
- MacKenzie McHale.

36:15.590 --> 36:17.132
- Attack!
- Nah.

36:17.217 --> 36:19.969
Look, I'll be here at 9:00
unless you're leaving the building.

36:20.053 --> 36:22.513
In which case, press pound five
on your phone and I'll be here.

36:22.597 --> 36:24.557
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.

36:27.477 --> 36:29.103
Fox offered you a late-night talk show.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.939
- Great, when do I start?
- Five years ago.

36:32.232 --> 36:33.816
They offered you the show
when we were together.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.527
It was gonna take you to LA
and it got as far as the deal memo.

36:37.362 --> 36:38.654
What is it you think you've uncovered?

36:38.738 --> 36:41.907
This whole time
you've enjoyed making me feel guilty

36:41.992 --> 36:44.368
for ruining the life
we would have had together

36:44.452 --> 36:48.122
when, in fact,
you never had any intention of marrying me.

36:48.331 --> 36:50.833
No intention of marrying me.

36:50.917 --> 36:51.917
I mean, you never even mentioned it.

36:52.002 --> 36:53.878
You were just gonna go to LA
and leave a note?

36:53.962 --> 36:56.005
Let me tell you something,
the days of you being able

36:56.089 --> 36:58.966
to lord my mistake over me are behind us.

36:59.050 --> 37:02.720
I've lived a life that is good and pure.

37:02.846 --> 37:04.889
You were deceiving me
while I was deceiving you.

37:04.973 --> 37:07.808
You never had any intention of... What's this?

37:30.081 --> 37:33.042
I didn't tell you about the Fox offer
because it was never real.

37:33.126 --> 37:34.710
I knew I was being used as leverage,

37:34.794 --> 37:38.839
and I didn't want to be embarrassed
in front of you when it went away.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.967
I was still trying to impress you.

37:44.220 --> 37:45.512
The ring was meant for me?

37:48.642 --> 37:50.851
But I've lived a life that's good and pure.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.228
Except for...

37:54.397 --> 37:55.940
Cheating on you.

37:56.024 --> 37:57.983
- Could you speak up?
- Cheating on you.

37:58.068 --> 38:00.527
- Except for cheating on you!
- There it is.

38:01.947 --> 38:04.365
Okay. Well, then,

38:05.367 --> 38:06.700
back to work.

38:07.702 --> 38:08.786
Yeah.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.709
Listen, when you do propose to someone,

38:15.794 --> 38:17.127
that's the ring that'll do it.

38:20.507 --> 38:21.882
Yeah.

38:26.972 --> 38:30.140
So as soon as you heard
they were doing opposition research,

38:30.225 --> 38:31.976
you ran over to Tiffany and bought the ring?

38:32.060 --> 38:33.936
That's insane.

38:34.020 --> 38:36.647
I had to send my agent
or it would have shown up in the papers.

38:36.731 --> 38:37.856
- Will.
- I'm gonna return it.

38:37.941 --> 38:39.692
Does that seem normal to you?

38:39.776 --> 38:41.485
The world is made up of two kinds of people.

38:41.569 --> 38:44.488
The ones who think they're normal
and the ones who know there's no such thing.

38:44.572 --> 38:47.783
Great, you took one semester
of Intro to Adult Psych.

38:47.867 --> 38:51.537
But the world is made up of
a lot more than two kinds of people.

38:52.205 --> 38:54.206
And I was speaking
in the psychiatric sense of the word.

38:54.290 --> 38:56.417
- Does going out and buying a ring...
- Which I'm going to return.

38:56.501 --> 39:00.587
...as a bizarre... I don't know what to call it,

39:00.672 --> 39:03.090
- seem normal to you?
- You weren't around for the exposition.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.591
She had an affair with her ex-boyfriend.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.510
For four months while she was with me.

39:06.594 --> 39:09.179
- It's four years later.
- And you know why I don't talk about it?

39:09.264 --> 39:13.183
Because I'm tired of people telling me
it's a "just get over it" situation.

39:13.268 --> 39:16.186
Fuck you.
You don't know what it's like in my head.

39:26.948 --> 39:29.116
Sloan Sabbith.

39:32.537 --> 39:35.039
It's a Japanese news report
from a few hours ago.

39:35.123 --> 39:38.292
We know they're talking about you,
but we don't know what they're saying.

39:43.840 --> 39:47.384
"After releasing incorrect information
to the American journalist Sloan Sabbith..."

39:47.469 --> 39:50.888
That's a picture of Elliot and
he didn't release incorrect information. I did.

39:50.972 --> 39:53.140
And it wasn't incorrect.

39:55.060 --> 39:58.145
"After releasing incorrect information
to the American journalist Sloan Sabbith...

40:03.651 --> 40:07.071
"TEPCO spokesman Daisuke Tanaka
has offered to resign today.

40:09.032 --> 40:13.410
"He said, 'I apologize to my company,
my government, and my country."'

40:20.585 --> 40:22.503
Please, I have to fix this now.

40:23.338 --> 40:25.631
Help me. I need wisdom.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.217
- I have wisdom.
- Kenzie, I love you,

40:28.301 --> 40:29.843
but a Japanese man's honor is at stake,

40:29.928 --> 40:32.471
and sometimes your wisdom leads to...

40:34.265 --> 40:35.641
Like...

40:39.187 --> 40:41.522
- No, I get it.
- Yeah.

40:42.065 --> 40:43.482
Will?

40:45.276 --> 40:48.362
She'd just been suspended
and she's thinking about the other guy's job.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.364
Honor, actually, is what she said.

40:50.573 --> 40:52.658
Meanwhile, she's a punch line on the Internet.

40:53.034 --> 40:55.202
- And he's got students, too.
- Who?

40:55.328 --> 40:57.371
Sloan. She teaches at Columbia twice a week.

40:57.747 --> 41:00.040
You said, "He." "He's got students."

41:00.500 --> 41:02.960
And you feel that's a breakthrough moment?

41:03.044 --> 41:04.962
That my subconscious revealed something?

41:05.046 --> 41:06.004
'Cause I'll be honest.

41:06.089 --> 41:08.465
I'm pretty sure
the reason I said "he" instead of "she"

41:08.550 --> 41:11.635
is that I've been awake
for a really long time now.

41:11.719 --> 41:14.096
But those comments
weren't on your site, right?

41:14.180 --> 41:16.890
No, because nobody's gonna say that
unless they're anonymous.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.517
And if you don't count the death threat,
it worked.

41:18.601 --> 41:21.311
It was bully kryptonite.
No more LollypopLollypop.

41:21.396 --> 41:24.314
- What did SurrendrDorothee mean when...
- Huh?

41:24.774 --> 41:26.567
The screen name of the person...

41:26.651 --> 41:27.818
It's what the...

41:27.902 --> 41:29.653
- Yeah, the screen name of the person...
- Yeah.

41:29.737 --> 41:31.280
On the last night
you showed anonymous posts.

41:31.364 --> 41:33.615
It's what the witch wrote in the sky...

41:33.700 --> 41:35.659
I'm not asking what the screen name means.

41:35.743 --> 41:37.995
I'm asking what the person,
that when he or she said

41:38.079 --> 41:42.124
that your guest that night had
hit the Uncle Tom Daily Double.

41:45.086 --> 41:48.589
The guest he or she was talking about
was a man named Sutton Wall,

41:49.090 --> 41:51.967
who was the deputy chief of staff
to Rick Santorum,

41:52.093 --> 41:53.468
former senator for Pennsylvania

41:53.553 --> 41:56.763
who just announced his intention to
run for President of the United States.

41:56.848 --> 42:00.184
The list of prospective candidates
for the Republican nomination for president

42:00.268 --> 42:02.019
may yet include another name.

42:02.103 --> 42:04.354
Earlier this week,
former Pennsylvania senator

42:04.439 --> 42:06.857
Rick Santorum convened
an exploratory committee...

42:07.233 --> 42:10.110
And Sutton Wall is both black and gay.

42:10.195 --> 42:14.781
The senator is perhaps best known for
his full-throated advocacy of social issues.

42:14.991 --> 42:16.825
Here to discuss how
those positions and others

42:16.910 --> 42:18.869
may shape Mr. Santorum's
bid for the White House

42:18.953 --> 42:21.622
is his former deputy chief of staff Sutton Wall,

42:21.873 --> 42:24.708
an adjunct professor
of American Studies at Temple University,

42:24.792 --> 42:28.003
who will be serving as an advisor
to the campaign throughout this process.

42:28.171 --> 42:30.130
He teaches at Temple?

42:31.382 --> 42:33.300
- Yeah.
- So he has students?

42:36.512 --> 42:38.347
Yes, he has students.

42:38.431 --> 42:41.058
And LollypopLollypop
said you almost made him cry.

42:41.142 --> 42:44.353
That... That was absolutely not my intention.

42:44.646 --> 42:46.730
Well, you're hardwired to hate bullies.

42:46.814 --> 42:51.526
Like the way comic book heroes
are born out of a childhood trauma.

42:51.653 --> 42:54.238
Santorum was the bully in that situation.

42:54.530 --> 42:57.032
Speaking to the New York Times in May 2005,

42:57.116 --> 42:59.243
Senator Santorum said,

42:59.327 --> 43:02.579
"Gay marriage threatens my marriage.
It threatens all marriages.

43:02.664 --> 43:05.415
"It threatens the traditional values
of this country."

43:05.500 --> 43:09.336
Mr. Wall, how does gay marriage
threaten Mr. Santorum's marriage?

43:09.504 --> 43:11.880
The senator believes that marriage is defined

43:11.965 --> 43:13.548
as the union of one man and one woman.

43:13.633 --> 43:15.467
I understand that's what
the former senator believes,

43:15.551 --> 43:16.802
but what he said was

43:16.886 --> 43:19.805
that gay marriage threatens his marriage
and all marriages.

43:19.889 --> 43:22.015
And I'm asking you exactly how it's a threat.

43:22.558 --> 43:25.769
Sanctity of life is the number one issue
with Rick Santorum, and he believes...

43:25.853 --> 43:28.855
Mr. Wall, we'll get to purposely vague words
like sanctity in a moment.

43:28.940 --> 43:31.775
But I'd like you to try to answer the question.

43:31.859 --> 43:34.945
How is Mr. Santorum's marriage threatened

43:35.029 --> 43:37.739
by the gay couple two houses down
also being married?

43:37.824 --> 43:40.492
Will, I was proud to serve
on the senator's staff,

43:40.576 --> 43:43.578
and I'll be proud to serve and support him
should he choose to run for president.

43:43.663 --> 43:45.622
But that doesn't mean
I necessarily agree with him

43:45.707 --> 43:47.708
on every single issue.

43:47.792 --> 43:52.170
Gay marriage is now legal in five states
as well as the District of Columbia.

43:52.463 --> 43:56.633
Has Mr. Santorum's marriage
been suffering as a result?

43:56.718 --> 43:59.303
Has he complained to you
that he and Mrs. Santorum

43:59.387 --> 44:01.179
seem to be fighting more or talking less?

44:01.723 --> 44:04.308
- Of course not.
- Has there been any infidelity

44:04.392 --> 44:07.436
in the last seven years
or an inability to relate to their children

44:07.520 --> 44:09.980
as a result of five states
legalizing same-sex marriage?

44:10.064 --> 44:12.065
This is a preposterous
line of questioning, sir.

44:12.150 --> 44:14.651
I'm afraid it has to be, sir,
because it's a preposterous assertion.

44:14.736 --> 44:16.695
Now, are you able to name one way

44:16.779 --> 44:19.656
in which Mr. Santorum's
marriage to Mrs. Santorum

44:19.741 --> 44:22.951
is threatened by gay couples
also having the right to marry?

44:23.411 --> 44:25.329
I...

44:28.791 --> 44:30.000
I am not able to name a way.

44:30.084 --> 44:31.418
Thank you.

44:33.588 --> 44:35.422
I could have just stopped it there.

44:35.506 --> 44:37.341
Does it bother you that Mr. Santorum thinks

44:37.425 --> 44:39.176
there's something wrong with you
that should be fixed?

44:39.260 --> 44:42.179
Hang on, because I am sick and tired
of these attacks,

44:42.263 --> 44:45.515
these wrongheaded attacks against
a great man and a great public servant.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.768
Reasonable people can disagree
about how great a man

44:47.852 --> 44:50.771
or how great a public servant
Rick Santorum is,

44:50.855 --> 44:52.606
but they can't disagree about
the fact that he thinks

44:52.690 --> 44:55.609
you're a sick deviant
who's threatening the fabric of society.

44:55.693 --> 44:57.861
I have known this man for almost a decade,

44:57.945 --> 45:00.906
and I can tell you that he has treated me
with nothing but respect.

45:00.990 --> 45:03.700
This is Senator Santorum
speaking to Fox News.

45:03.785 --> 45:06.536
- Easy does it, Will.
- No, we're gonna do this thing.

45:06.621 --> 45:07.829
...that this is the equivalent,

45:07.914 --> 45:12.667
that being black and being gay
is the same is simply not true.

45:12.752 --> 45:16.463
There are all sorts of studies out there
that suggest just the contrary,

45:16.547 --> 45:19.883
and there are people who were gay
and lived a gay lifestyle

45:20.093 --> 45:23.011
and aren't anymore.
I don't know if that's the similar situation.

45:23.096 --> 45:25.389
I don't think that's the case with
anybody that's black.

45:25.473 --> 45:27.557
Mr. Santorum is forgiving you for being black

45:27.642 --> 45:29.351
because there's nothing
you can do about that.

45:29.435 --> 45:30.811
But you don't have to be gay.

45:30.895 --> 45:33.605
I will say it again. Mr. Santorum is a great man

45:33.689 --> 45:35.232
who would make a great president.

45:35.316 --> 45:38.276
He has never treated me with anything
but the utmost respect.

45:38.361 --> 45:40.362
Except for finding you disgusting.

45:40.446 --> 45:42.239
- That is a lie.
- Will, don't...

45:42.323 --> 45:44.825
Has Rick Santorum on
the floor of the US Senate

45:44.909 --> 45:47.619
compared homosexuality
to incest and bestiality?

45:47.703 --> 45:50.163
Those remarks have been taken out of context
over the years...

45:50.248 --> 45:52.666
Feel free to put the remarks
in the proper context.

45:52.750 --> 45:57.212
He makes a clear distinction
between homosexuality and homosexual acts.

45:57.463 --> 45:59.923
So he only finds you disgusting
when you act like a homosexual?

46:00.007 --> 46:02.050
- He doesn't find me disgusting.
- Yes, he does.

46:02.260 --> 46:03.718
And he also thinks you're less than a man.

46:03.803 --> 46:05.095
- No, he certainly does not.
- Come on.

46:05.179 --> 46:06.972
Our Declaration contains the words

46:07.056 --> 46:09.057
"We hold these truths to be self-evident

46:09.142 --> 46:11.268
"that all men are created equal."

46:11.352 --> 46:12.894
In order to arrive at the conclusion

46:12.979 --> 46:16.231
that homosexual love
is something less than heterosexual love,

46:16.315 --> 46:17.691
you have to begin with the premise

46:17.775 --> 46:19.860
that a homosexual is
something less than a man.

46:19.944 --> 46:21.153
That's inescapable.

46:21.237 --> 46:23.738
And so I'm asking you to explain to me

46:24.157 --> 46:27.617
why you would work for a man
who believes that you're inferior.

46:27.702 --> 46:30.412
- That you're damaged. That you're ill.
- Stop hitting him.

46:30.496 --> 46:32.247
Unnatural. A threat to children.

46:32.331 --> 46:33.957
Unfit to serve in the military.

46:34.041 --> 46:36.293
Unfit to be a parent. And unloved by God.

46:36.544 --> 46:38.879
- I'm asking you, sir...
- Stop! Just stop!

46:39.380 --> 46:42.632
I believe in the sanctity of life.

46:42.717 --> 46:44.509
And if that word is too vague for you,
then look it up.

46:45.178 --> 46:48.013
I support the senator
because of all the candidates in the field,

46:48.097 --> 46:52.809
I believe he is the only one whose passion
on the issue of abortion equals my own.

46:52.894 --> 46:56.146
And I believe he has the skills
to make a fantastic president.

46:56.230 --> 46:57.439
I am not talking... That's not...

46:57.523 --> 47:00.609
You will not interrupt me again, sir!

47:01.736 --> 47:03.570
I am more than one thing.

47:05.072 --> 47:07.491
How dare you reduce me
to the color of my skin

47:07.575 --> 47:09.659
or my sexual orientation?

47:11.245 --> 47:14.331
There are people who look just like me,
thousands and thousands

47:14.415 --> 47:17.876
who died for the freedom
to define their own lives for themselves.

47:17.960 --> 47:21.421
How dare you presume to decide
what I should think is important.

47:22.882 --> 47:25.675
Yes, when it comes to
equality for the gay community,

47:25.760 --> 47:27.719
Senator Santorum is wrong.

47:27.803 --> 47:31.264
But I am far more insulted
by your high-handed implication

47:31.349 --> 47:33.266
- that I need your protection.
- Sir, I...

47:33.351 --> 47:36.353
Shut up! I'll let you know when I'm finished.

47:39.774 --> 47:44.027
I came on this program
because Rick Santorum believes

47:44.111 --> 47:48.865
that the right to kill an unborn child
is not inalienable.

47:48.950 --> 47:51.576
And I stand with Rick Santorum.

47:51.661 --> 47:54.287
And I stand with the Catholic Church.

47:56.624 --> 47:59.459
I am not defined by my blackness.

47:59.544 --> 48:02.379
I am not defined by my gayness.

48:03.714 --> 48:06.007
And if that doesn't fit
your narrow-minded expectation

48:06.092 --> 48:08.510
of who I'm supposed to be,
I don't give a damn

48:08.636 --> 48:10.720
because I'm not defined by you either.

48:11.597 --> 48:14.975
So get this through your head.

48:15.560 --> 48:20.480
I don't need your help.

48:23.484 --> 48:24.526
Mr. Wall?

48:30.157 --> 48:33.326
Does Mr. Santorum think
you're fit to be a teacher?

48:40.418 --> 48:42.377
No.

48:44.505 --> 48:46.840
We'll be back after this.

48:54.348 --> 48:56.433
He has students.

48:56.517 --> 48:58.685
And parents.

48:58.769 --> 49:00.979
And friends.

49:01.063 --> 49:02.480
And colleagues. And strangers.

49:02.773 --> 49:05.191
I was the bully.

49:08.029 --> 49:10.822
I was the bully.

49:12.199 --> 49:13.283
Mm-hmm.

49:16.412 --> 49:19.581
You've got to give me credit
for uniting the far right, the gay community,

49:19.665 --> 49:21.833
and blacks in their dislike of me.

49:21.917 --> 49:23.293
The Internet exploded.

49:23.377 --> 49:25.295
Everybody thought I'd become unhinged.

49:25.379 --> 49:26.963
It sort of brought back this thing

49:27.048 --> 49:28.965
that happened about
a year ago at Northwestern.

49:29.050 --> 49:31.760
When you yelled at a student.

49:33.971 --> 49:35.013
I scared her.

49:42.980 --> 49:53.865
All right.

49:55.034 --> 49:57.369
That's News Night. Thanks for washing us...
Watching us.

49:58.079 --> 50:00.288
- Let me get out of here.
- End the broadcast.

50:00.373 --> 50:02.165
- I'm Will McAvoy.
- Attaboy.

50:02.249 --> 50:05.669
Terry Smith is coming up, mercifully,
with The Capitol Report from Washington.

50:05.753 --> 50:07.712
Good night.

50:11.926 --> 50:14.511
If you're here to make me feel better,
it's not necessary.

50:14.595 --> 50:16.763
You think I'm here to make you feel better?

50:16.847 --> 50:18.848
The story is right. In this one case,

50:18.933 --> 50:20.850
I don't give a damn about on the record,
off the record.

50:20.935 --> 50:23.269
- And no one in Fukushima does either.
- I do.

50:24.188 --> 50:25.188
The story is right.

50:25.272 --> 50:27.691
- His spokesman denied it on the air.
- He said it to me!

50:27.775 --> 50:30.360
And you got proof of that
I can bounce off our satellite?

50:30.444 --> 50:31.778
- No!
- Is Maggie into Jim?

50:31.862 --> 50:34.406
For Christ's sake, we're talking about... What?

50:37.618 --> 50:39.494
Am I losing Maggie?

50:40.996 --> 50:42.330
No.

50:49.547 --> 50:51.131
Are you good at knowing these things?

50:53.801 --> 50:55.593
No.

50:58.556 --> 51:01.349
Make sure he's at Dr. Habib's office
at 10:00 tomorrow.

51:01.642 --> 51:03.518
When are you and me gonna get busy?

51:03.602 --> 51:05.311
I'm flattered, but you'd crush me.

51:05.396 --> 51:06.688
That's true. That's happened before.

51:06.939 --> 51:09.899
Dress up like a tailback
and he won't be able to lay a hand on you.

51:09.984 --> 51:12.068
Shrimp boat,
if I wasn't being paid to keep you alive...

51:12.153 --> 51:13.862
- Let's go.
- Hey, girl!

51:15.030 --> 51:16.865
Do you really have to call her that?

51:16.949 --> 51:18.199
She's packing up her office.

51:18.284 --> 51:20.493
She's gonna unpack her office
'cause I figured a way out.

51:21.120 --> 51:22.120
What?

51:22.204 --> 51:25.373
The Japanese words
for four and seven sound alike.

51:27.543 --> 51:30.086
- Hey, girl!
- Yes?

51:30.171 --> 51:32.005
Come on down.

51:41.348 --> 51:43.308
I am here.

51:43.392 --> 51:45.560
What's the Japanese word for four?

51:45.853 --> 51:46.811
Shi.

51:46.896 --> 51:49.397
- What's the Japanese word for seven?
- Shichi.

51:49.523 --> 51:50.982
Those words are easy to mix up.

51:51.066 --> 51:52.484
- No, they're not.
- Yes, they are.

51:52.568 --> 51:53.985
Not for someone who's fluent in Japanese.

51:54.111 --> 51:56.362
- You're not fluent in Japanese.
- Yes, I am.

51:56.447 --> 51:58.323
No, you're not.
That's how you mixed up the numbers

51:58.407 --> 52:00.617
when you were talking to
Tanaka in the preinterview.

52:00.701 --> 52:01.951
No, it's for exactly that reason

52:02.036 --> 52:04.287
that there are two words for four
and two words for seven.

52:04.371 --> 52:07.624
Yon and nana.
And it went from a four to a five to a seven.

52:07.708 --> 52:09.334
That sounds very complicated.

52:09.418 --> 52:10.794
Not if you're fluent in Japanese.

52:10.878 --> 52:12.629
You're not anymore.

52:12.713 --> 52:16.633
You're gonna go on TV tonight
during Elliot's show,

52:16.717 --> 52:19.594
- which I pray to God Elliot is hosting.
- He is.

52:19.720 --> 52:22.388
And you're going to apologize
and explain your error.

52:22.473 --> 52:25.892
In exchange, Daisuke Tanaka is going to say

52:25.976 --> 52:28.478
that you made it clear
that you were on the record

52:28.562 --> 52:31.564
and he doesn't have to resign
and you don't have to be suspended.

52:31.857 --> 52:33.983
We're all going to just lie
and I'm going to look stupid.

52:34.151 --> 52:36.277
- You bet. One more thing.
- What?

52:36.654 --> 52:39.656
Fukushima's announcing
the radiation levels are a seven.

52:40.241 --> 52:41.366
Thank you.

52:41.450 --> 52:43.243
I don't know what the hell
you're thanking me for.

52:43.327 --> 52:45.995
Well, it takes a big man
to admit he was wrong.

52:46.080 --> 52:48.706
That isn't even remotely what I am doing.

52:48.791 --> 52:52.168
Hang on, she's got to go on the air
and say she made a mistake,

52:52.253 --> 52:53.419
that her Japanese is poor...

52:53.504 --> 52:55.713
- Which it certainly is not.
- Just... God.

52:55.798 --> 52:58.466
She's gonna go on the air
and say she thought it was a seven

52:58.551 --> 53:00.635
when it's really a four
that then moved up to a five

53:00.719 --> 53:03.346
and she's really sorry,
but also now it's really a seven?

53:03.722 --> 53:07.308
It won't be our proudest moment,
but it'll save the guy's job.

53:07.852 --> 53:09.435
Save his honor.

53:09.520 --> 53:13.690
Help very slightly
with our increasingly dinged-up reputation,

53:13.774 --> 53:16.484
and it'll help the girl who we will now go back

53:16.569 --> 53:19.821
to addressing as Sloan or Miss Sabbith.

53:20.114 --> 53:21.531
Will.

53:25.786 --> 53:27.662
You want me to lie?

53:28.163 --> 53:29.289
On television?

53:30.124 --> 53:33.918
From a news desk
with the ACN bug in the corner?

53:38.299 --> 53:39.549
I do.

53:41.260 --> 53:44.554
And if there's any fallout,
I'll be standing right next to you and in front.

53:44.638 --> 53:47.765
I'll always be standing right next to you
and in front.

53:52.563 --> 53:54.606
We fucked up.

53:55.566 --> 53:57.859
Let's just live with that now.

54:13.292 --> 54:16.252
We lied on television from the news desk.

54:16.337 --> 54:18.004
It was a pretty harmless lie, wasn't it?

54:18.088 --> 54:20.757
You know how many air hours I've spent
railing against lying?

54:20.841 --> 54:22.759
Calling people out on it?

54:22.843 --> 54:26.596
We're the news and we're all gonna
know we lied for the rest of our lives.

54:27.264 --> 54:30.600
All right, so it turns out
you know what you're doing.

54:30.684 --> 54:32.060
So I'm sorry I've been a jerk.

54:32.436 --> 54:35.063
Obviously the reason
I can't sleep is the Santorum aide.

54:35.147 --> 54:37.607
And I haven't talked to anyone about it,
so I was trying...

54:37.691 --> 54:39.192
- Bacon.
- What?

54:39.777 --> 54:41.486
The bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches.

54:41.946 --> 54:44.989
Bacon has tyramine, which increases
the release of norepinephrine,

54:45.074 --> 54:47.200
which is a neurostimulant.

54:47.284 --> 54:48.326
When did you figure that out?

54:48.410 --> 54:49.994
When you said you made bacon,
egg, and cheese sandwiches.

54:50.079 --> 54:52.372
- That was like an hour ago!
- Yeah.

54:53.040 --> 54:56.292
Will, listen,
and I'm going to write you a mild prescription,

54:57.211 --> 54:58.461
but you should come back.

54:58.879 --> 55:01.965
If you don't like me, see someone else.

55:02.049 --> 55:05.093
But see someone.
You've had a lot going on for a long time.

55:05.177 --> 55:06.678
Very serious stuff. And, by the way,

55:06.762 --> 55:10.556
you should be at an Al-Anon meeting
at least once a week.

55:10.641 --> 55:12.725
You have a lot going on now.

55:13.978 --> 55:15.144
You're being hunted.

55:15.980 --> 55:17.438
In the press,

55:18.565 --> 55:20.483
on the Internet,

55:20.859 --> 55:23.111
very possibly literally.

55:24.113 --> 55:28.032
This whole file here from four years ago,
every page is about MacKenzie.

55:28.450 --> 55:32.412
In these notes are a lot of evidence
that you're experiencing acute depression

55:32.746 --> 55:34.539
and doing a masterful job covering it.

55:34.623 --> 55:35.957
That's done.

55:37.751 --> 55:40.253
Buying the ring was not normal.

55:41.213 --> 55:43.131
I don't know what else to call it.
It wasn't normal.

55:47.386 --> 55:50.847
It really doesn't take
a team of Viennese specialists

55:50.931 --> 55:53.141
to see that you have
unresolved issues with MacKenzie.

55:53.225 --> 55:55.601
No, my feelings are
completely resolved.

55:56.103 --> 55:58.271
She's a good friend
and my most trusted partner.

55:58.355 --> 55:59.731
The ring was just a prank.

56:06.947 --> 56:09.615
I know what you think of all this.

56:10.909 --> 56:15.079
But I would really urge you
to spend an hour a week

56:15.164 --> 56:16.706
faking it.

56:18.625 --> 56:21.419
That's it. Our time's up.
