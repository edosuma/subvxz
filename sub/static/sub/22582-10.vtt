WEBVTT

00:11.927 --> 00:15.283
These are at least 300 years older
than the ones in the last chamber.

00:15.407 --> 00:17.159
You sure you can't read any of this?

00:17.287 --> 00:19.039
Nope. How about you?

00:22.887 --> 00:25.879
Well, I think this says
tall guys are popular.

00:26.487 --> 00:28.045
You're a budding linguist.

00:29.087 --> 00:30.679
Let's get a shot of that one.

00:37.247 --> 00:40.205
- I wonder what happened to them.
- It is kind of weird.

00:40.527 --> 00:43.360
Not a single bio-sign
on the entire planet.

00:47.287 --> 00:49.926
- Tucker.
- You about finished down there, Trip?

00:50.047 --> 00:51.878
You can't believe these ruins, sir.

00:52.007 --> 00:53.963
We've been through
two dozen chambers.

00:54.087 --> 00:55.759
No telling how many more there are.

00:55.887 --> 00:58.355
I'm afraid you're not going to
find out today.

00:58.487 --> 01:01.365
That storm we told you about
hasn't changed course.

01:01.487 --> 01:04.081
You and Hoshi are gonna need
to get back to Enterprise.

01:04.206 --> 01:06.596
We'll just finish up
with Mr Tall and Popular.

01:06.727 --> 01:09.958
We should be back to the shuttlepod
in 5, 6 minutes.

01:10.087 --> 01:12.965
Don't take any longer than that.
Archer out.

01:13.367 --> 01:16.245
Captain, we have another storm.

01:16.767 --> 01:18.405
Another one?

01:22.007 --> 01:24.237
The discharges are more intense.

01:24.367 --> 01:26.642
- It's a good deal bigger.
- And stronger.

01:26.767 --> 01:29.076
It's pushing the first storm
through these mountains...

01:29.207 --> 01:31.402
at twice the speed it was moving
a few minutes ago.

01:31.527 --> 01:35.315
They're diamagnetic storms, Captain,
saturated with polaric energy.

01:37.207 --> 01:38.435
This is the shuttle?

01:38.567 --> 01:41.081
Less than 10 kilometres
from the first storm.

01:45.807 --> 01:47.445
You may not be able to see it yet...

01:47.567 --> 01:50.240
but it'll be coming
through the mountain pass to the north.

01:50.367 --> 01:52.642
We can see it just fine, Captain.

01:52.767 --> 01:56.043
The storms are throwing up too much
interference into the atmosphere.

01:56.167 --> 01:57.919
The shuttle's out of the question.

01:59.967 --> 02:03.642
These ruins have very thick walls.
I'm sure we'll be safe inside.

02:03.767 --> 02:07.123
I'm afraid we're not talking
about thunderclouds, Hoshi.

02:07.407 --> 02:10.842
A polaric burst
that could short-circuit a shuttlepod...

02:11.327 --> 02:13.443
could do a lot worse
to your nervous system.

02:13.567 --> 02:16.479
But, sir, these buildings
are over 4,000 years old.

02:16.607 --> 02:19.041
I'm sure they've survived
hundreds of these storms.

02:19.167 --> 02:21.761
I've sent Malcolm
down to the transporter.

02:22.487 --> 02:25.206
We're going to need to bring you up
one at a time.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.643
Couldn't we wait it out
inside the shuttle?

02:27.767 --> 02:29.325
Polarise the hull plating.

02:29.447 --> 02:32.280
That would most likely attract
a polaric discharge.

02:33.367 --> 02:36.086
You have to do this, Hoshi.
There's no choice.

02:36.207 --> 02:39.358
I'll need you clear of the structure,
one at a time.

02:39.487 --> 02:41.045
Understood, Captain.

02:48.167 --> 02:50.556
- Ladies first.
- Have you ever done this?

02:50.687 --> 02:53.076
No, but the Captain has,
and Malcolm did it twice.

02:53.207 --> 02:54.765
They said there's nothing to it.

02:54.887 --> 02:57.162
Your molecules get pulled apart.

02:57.807 --> 02:59.638
Then they get put back together again.

02:59.767 --> 03:02.565
Do you know how many molecules
you're made up of?

03:02.687 --> 03:04.405
- Lots.
- All right. How many?

03:04.527 --> 03:07.564
- A few trillion.
- That's a pretty big jigsaw puzzle.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.837
What if some pieces
get put in the wrong place?

03:09.967 --> 03:11.798
I bet a lot of them look real similar.

03:11.927 --> 03:15.203
Starfleet said it's safe.
That's good enough for me.

03:15.567 --> 03:17.478
Okay, but, you go first...

03:17.607 --> 03:19.484
and if you get to Enterprise
in one piece...

03:19.607 --> 03:21.484
- I'll be right behind you.
- Fair enough.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:32.807 --> 03:35.275
- Tucker to Enterprise.
- I read you, Commander.

03:35.967 --> 03:37.366
Ready to go.

03:45.447 --> 03:47.677
- Commander?
- Safe and sound.

03:48.287 --> 03:49.959
I'm on my way, sir.

03:59.847 --> 04:02.361
Ensign Sato ready for transport.

04:14.767 --> 04:16.120
Welcome to the club.

04:16.247 --> 04:19.238
How do those molecules feel?
All in the right place?

04:19.367 --> 04:20.925
I'll let you know.

04:28.687 --> 04:31.247
It's been a long road

04:33.847 --> 04:35.917
Gettin' from there to here

04:36.047 --> 04:38.800
It's been a long time

04:39.647 --> 04:43.117
But my time is finally near

04:43.607 --> 04:46.997
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

04:47.847 --> 04:50.680
I will touch the sky

04:51.087 --> 04:54.716
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

04:54.847 --> 04:57.839
No, they're not gonna change my mind

04:57.967 --> 05:02.245
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

05:02.407 --> 05:05.444
I'm going where my heart will take me

05:05.607 --> 05:09.759
I've got faith to believe

05:09.887 --> 05:12.845
I can do anything

05:12.967 --> 05:16.676
I've got strength of the soul

05:17.287 --> 05:20.279
And no one's gonna bend or break me

05:20.407 --> 05:24.559
I can reach any star

05:25.767 --> 05:27.758
I've got faith

05:29.607 --> 05:32.724
I've got faith

05:33.287 --> 05:36.563
Faith of the heart

06:11.167 --> 06:12.395
Come in.

06:14.447 --> 06:17.439
- No worse for the wear, Ensign?
- I guess you could say that, sir.

06:17.567 --> 06:20.798
I'll be at my post in a few minutes.
I just want to clean up and change.

06:20.927 --> 06:23.236
I think you've had enough excitement
for one afternoon.

06:23.367 --> 06:26.165
- The morning will be fine.
- Thank you.

06:26.887 --> 06:30.277
I assume you and Trip will want to
finish your survey tomorrow...

06:30.407 --> 06:32.477
- weather permitting.
- Sir?

06:32.847 --> 06:36.556
You left a shuttlepod there, remember?
Somebody's got to go back and get it.

06:36.687 --> 06:40.680
I'm sure Commander Tucker can find
someone to hold the second flash unit.

06:40.807 --> 06:44.959
You wouldn't be using the transporter.
You'd be taking the other pod.

06:46.087 --> 06:48.396
- I don't want to get lost.
- Lost?

06:53.767 --> 06:57.885
Too much excitement for one day.
I could really use some rest, sir.

06:59.047 --> 07:00.719
See you in the morning.

07:10.287 --> 07:13.677
- That's a lie, Malcolm.
- We all heard it, Commander.

07:13.807 --> 07:16.196
- There's no use pretending.
- Come on, Travis.

07:16.327 --> 07:17.806
Anyone sitting here?

07:17.927 --> 07:20.077
But that's what you said, though.

07:21.727 --> 07:24.685
- Is anyone sitting here?
- No. Please.

07:26.887 --> 07:29.162
- So, what was it like?
- Travis.

07:29.727 --> 07:31.001
Let her eat her supper.

07:31.127 --> 07:34.403
It was very unsettling.
Didn't you find it unsettling?

07:35.447 --> 07:39.235
For a minute or two, but once
I counted my fingers and toes...

07:39.367 --> 07:41.676
I don't know, I just don't feel right.

07:42.767 --> 07:44.723
It was probably that storm.

07:44.847 --> 07:48.044
- You don't forget things like that quickly.
- It's not the storms.

07:48.167 --> 07:49.964
It's the transporter.

07:50.127 --> 07:52.721
I don't feel like myself
since I went through it.

07:53.007 --> 07:55.999
I need to check the medical database
and find out what happened...

07:56.127 --> 07:58.357
to the people they used
when they tested that thing.

07:58.487 --> 08:00.842
You mean other than Cyrus Ramsey?

08:01.447 --> 08:02.721
Cyrus Ramsey?

08:03.207 --> 08:05.641
Don't tell me
you don't know about poor Cyrus.

08:05.767 --> 08:07.280
Am I supposed to?

08:07.407 --> 08:10.922
You can't go on a survival overnight
without hearing the story of someone...

08:11.047 --> 08:14.596
seeing Ramsey's molecules
re-materialising on a foggy night.

08:15.607 --> 08:17.040
What happened to him?

08:17.167 --> 08:20.045
Next thing you'll tell us
you never heard of the Easter Bunny.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.839
What happened to him?

08:23.607 --> 08:28.044
Madison, Wisconsin. May, I think. 2146.

08:28.927 --> 08:32.715
He was a test subject
for the first long-range transport.

08:33.167 --> 08:34.759
Just 100 metres.

08:35.527 --> 08:38.325
Something went wrong
with the pattern buffer.

08:38.967 --> 08:40.605
He never re-materialised.

08:42.527 --> 08:45.678
Come on, Hoshi,
everybody's heard of Cyrus Ramsey.

08:46.047 --> 08:48.880
I must have fallen asleep
before the ghost stories.

08:49.607 --> 08:53.725
- Where'd you do your survival training?
- Death Valley, California.

08:54.167 --> 08:57.364
Middle of July, naturally. You?

08:58.407 --> 09:01.843
Captain and I were in the same group.
Alice Springs, Australia.

09:02.607 --> 09:06.156
Never saw so many flies in my life.
The biting kind.

09:08.487 --> 09:10.478
- Tucker.
- The storms are breaking up.

09:10.607 --> 09:13.440
We shouldn't have trouble
getting you back down in the morning.

09:13.567 --> 09:16.001
Travis was just telling me
he'd like to see the ruins.

09:16.127 --> 09:18.163
I don't think Hoshi will be joining you.

09:18.287 --> 09:20.357
I'll need a pilot
to bring the other pod back.

09:20.487 --> 09:23.320
Travis it is. I'll see you both
in the morning. Archer out.

09:24.687 --> 09:27.884
- Never say I don't take you anywhere.
- You don't take me anywhere.

09:31.487 --> 09:32.966
See you later.

09:37.487 --> 09:38.522
Doctor?

09:40.647 --> 09:41.841
Dr Phlox?

09:51.327 --> 09:52.840
- Hello?
- Ensign.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.679
Something I can do for you?

09:56.807 --> 09:58.843
I just looked in there.
Were you in there?

09:58.967 --> 10:01.845
- Did you hear me come in?
- I was feeding my leeches.

10:02.087 --> 10:04.920
- Are you all right?
- You didn't hear me.

10:05.647 --> 10:08.764
I'm right here, Ensign.
Are you not feeling well?

10:09.367 --> 10:11.358
No, I'm not feeling well.

10:12.687 --> 10:16.566
I de-materialised,
and then I re-materialised and...

10:18.087 --> 10:19.998
No, I'm not feeling well.

10:20.127 --> 10:21.879
I heard about your ordeal
on the surface.

10:22.007 --> 10:23.998
Those storms sounded terrifying.

10:24.727 --> 10:28.959
Doctor, I'm not talking about the storms.
I'm talking about my molecules.

10:30.527 --> 10:32.916
Come sit down. Let's take a look.

10:43.527 --> 10:46.041
It'll take me a while
to account for every molecule...

10:46.167 --> 10:48.283
but you appear to be in one piece.

10:48.407 --> 10:51.717
I don't think you're in danger
of becoming the next Cyrus Ramsey.

10:51.847 --> 10:54.122
Don't tell me they talk about him
on Denobula.

10:54.247 --> 10:57.239
I spent nearly nine months on Earth,
remember?

10:57.607 --> 10:59.404
I just don't feel right.

10:59.527 --> 11:02.883
Ever since the transport,
I've been shaky, not myself.

11:03.767 --> 11:06.361
- Not a single bio-molecular anomaly.
- No?

11:06.687 --> 11:08.166
How about this?

11:09.327 --> 11:10.885
A subcutaneous pigmentation.

11:11.007 --> 11:14.317
It's not where it used to be.
It was a good centimetre lower.

11:14.647 --> 11:16.956
Well, it looks lovely where it is now.

11:17.127 --> 11:19.083
It's not a joke, Doctor.

11:19.487 --> 11:23.082
If that machine could move a birthmark,
who knows what else it could do?

11:24.527 --> 11:26.722
I'm telling you, I don't feel right.

11:27.287 --> 11:30.438
I have a lot of animals to feed
before bedtime.

11:30.567 --> 11:33.400
If I were you,
I'd get a good night's sleep.

11:46.647 --> 11:49.115
- Hello?
- You're needed on the Bridge, Ensign.

11:49.727 --> 11:51.957
- What time is it?
- 1100 hours.

11:52.207 --> 11:55.404
- There's been an emergency.
- 1100 hours, that's impossible.

11:55.527 --> 11:58.325
- My shift starts at 0800.
- Now, Ensign.

12:04.567 --> 12:06.683
I'm sorry, Captain.
I don't know what happened.

12:06.807 --> 12:09.401
Tucker and Mayweather
have been taken hostage.

12:09.927 --> 12:12.964
Trip got off a short message,
but we've heard nothing in an hour.

12:13.087 --> 12:14.156
Taken hostage by who?

12:14.287 --> 12:16.960
The people down there
didn't like you disturbing their ruins.

12:17.087 --> 12:19.555
People?
There wasn't a bio-sign on the planet.

12:19.687 --> 12:23.600
The chambers you and Mr Tucker
photographed contained sacred relics.

12:23.727 --> 12:25.718
How could you possibly know that?

12:25.847 --> 12:28.566
- Have you found their bio-signs?
- They're still in the complex.

12:28.687 --> 12:31.247
I'm trying to isolate
the specific chamber.

12:31.727 --> 12:33.604
It's Mayweather's communicator.

12:36.847 --> 12:38.075
Go ahead, Travis.

12:43.407 --> 12:45.523
- Ensign?
- I need more.

12:48.047 --> 12:50.925
This is Captain Archer
of the Starship Enterprise.

12:52.567 --> 12:54.956
We apologise if we've trespassed.

12:56.127 --> 12:58.436
My crewmen didn't mean any harm.

13:02.487 --> 13:05.399
I'm sorry, sir, it's not working.
I'm going to need more.

13:07.367 --> 13:09.164
Can I speak to one of my officers?

13:16.207 --> 13:18.641
It's not going to get
much better than that.

13:19.487 --> 13:21.045
What's the problem?

13:22.607 --> 13:26.316
Maybe you should forget about the UT.
Just try and talk to them.

13:42.927 --> 13:45.680
If I went back to the
Universal Translator, maybe I could...

13:45.807 --> 13:48.196
You already tried that. Talk to them.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.841
- I can't.
- Lives are at stake, Ensign.

13:50.967 --> 13:53.606
I know.
I don't understand what he's saying.

13:54.407 --> 13:56.602
I'm sorry.

13:57.647 --> 13:59.444
No need to apologise.

13:59.927 --> 14:03.044
Why don't you go back to your quarters
and get some rest?

14:03.687 --> 14:07.441
Captain, I realise I overslept.
I don't know how it happened...

14:07.567 --> 14:10.559
but, please,
I don't want to go back to my quarters.

14:10.687 --> 14:12.518
- Take the comm.
- Aye, Captain.

14:12.687 --> 14:13.915
Malcolm.

15:49.967 --> 15:51.366
Anyone sitting here?

15:54.527 --> 15:55.846
Subcommander.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.561
Ensign. Would you like to join me?

16:03.567 --> 16:04.761
Thank you.

16:09.287 --> 16:11.403
I would have thought
you'd be on the Bridge.

16:11.527 --> 16:12.880
Why is that?

16:14.087 --> 16:16.203
Commander Tucker. Travis.

16:16.487 --> 16:20.116
The hostage situation was resolved.
They're back on board.

16:20.247 --> 16:23.080
It's only been an hour
since I left the Bridge. What happened?

16:23.207 --> 16:25.084
Crewman Baird
deciphered their language:

16:25.207 --> 16:26.799
A simple bi-modal syntax.

16:27.367 --> 16:30.564
- I don't understand. How?
- With the universal translator.

16:30.687 --> 16:33.599
That's impossible.
I ran every linguistic algorithm.

16:33.727 --> 16:36.844
When the Captain agreed
to return the soil and rock samples...

16:36.967 --> 16:39.003
and destroy the photographs
that were taken...

16:39.127 --> 16:41.004
the hostages were released.

16:42.407 --> 16:45.046
If we've decrypted their language,
I should get back to the Bridge.

16:45.167 --> 16:46.964
The Captain might want to
speak with them.

16:47.087 --> 16:50.363
Captain Archer has asked that
you remain off duty for the time being.

16:50.487 --> 16:53.479
Crewman Baird has been placed
in charge of Communications.

17:01.487 --> 17:04.001
After lunch, you should look at
the secondary couplings.

17:04.127 --> 17:05.685
- They'll need to be aligned.
- Alison.

17:05.807 --> 17:07.525
Start on C-Deck,
work your way downwards.

17:07.646 --> 17:08.796
Yes, ma'am.

17:27.807 --> 17:30.526
- The stream's too unstable.
- Come on, Hoshi.

17:30.647 --> 17:32.842
- What?
- You can do it, Ensign.

17:33.047 --> 17:35.561
It's as easy as one, two, three.

17:51.647 --> 17:54.115
- Can you see me?
- Ensign.

17:54.487 --> 17:56.000
Can you see me?

17:56.847 --> 17:59.805
Is there something in particular
you'd like me to look at?

18:00.727 --> 18:03.719
Something's wrong, Doctor.
Something's very wrong.

18:04.647 --> 18:06.524
Ever since I used that transporter...

18:06.647 --> 18:09.445
nothing has been the way
that it's supposed to be.

18:09.567 --> 18:13.526
I couldn't translate a simple bi-modal
syntax, but Crewman Baird could.

18:14.007 --> 18:17.795
Crewman Baird doesn't know the first
thing about our linguistic database.

18:17.927 --> 18:21.124
And Captain Archer told me
to stay in my quarters.

18:22.007 --> 18:24.885
But my mirror doesn't want to give me
a solid reflection...

18:25.007 --> 18:29.239
and my shower can't decide whether
to bounce off me or go through me.

18:30.687 --> 18:32.518
And nobody wants to talk to me.

18:33.527 --> 18:36.485
Sometimes I think
they don't even see that I'm there.

18:37.767 --> 18:40.327
The turbolift control
won't even respond to me.

18:40.447 --> 18:42.517
Well, I see you, Ensign.

18:42.647 --> 18:45.605
And the Sickbay doors responded
when you came in.

18:48.047 --> 18:50.641
Transporter technology is very new.

18:51.927 --> 18:55.522
I'm sure humans were just as frightened
when the automobile was introduced...

18:55.647 --> 18:57.205
or the aeroplane.

18:57.327 --> 19:00.046
New forms of transport
take a while to get used to.

19:00.167 --> 19:02.078
I'm not at all surprised at your reaction.

19:02.207 --> 19:04.596
You wouldn't catch me
using that apparatus.

19:05.287 --> 19:07.721
But I can promise you one thing.

19:08.567 --> 19:12.560
You're in perfect health.
You're neither transparent, nor porous.

19:13.447 --> 19:15.677
You won't put this in my medical record,
will you?

19:15.807 --> 19:18.799
As far as I'm concerned,
I didn't even see you come in here.

19:18.927 --> 19:20.440
Not funny, Doctor.

19:20.567 --> 19:24.845
I would like to give you a mild sedative.
It'll help you get a good night's sleep.

19:24.967 --> 19:26.480
If it's all the same to you...

19:26.607 --> 19:29.440
the last thing I need right now
is to be medicated.

19:30.167 --> 19:33.762
As you wish, but stop by in the morning,
all right?

19:36.047 --> 19:38.277
First thing. Thank you, Doctor.

19:52.047 --> 19:53.765
You're upside down, Ensign.

19:54.167 --> 19:57.239
I was taught never to contradict
a superior officer.

19:58.007 --> 20:00.919
The Captain told me what happened.
Did they treat you all right?

20:01.047 --> 20:02.844
Didn't even tie us up.

20:03.247 --> 20:05.681
Once the Captain promised to give them
their stuff back...

20:05.807 --> 20:08.924
they walked us to the shuttlepods,
and away we went.

20:09.447 --> 20:12.519
I'm sorry I wasn't more helpful
trying to translate.

20:12.727 --> 20:15.002
- I don't know what happened.
- We're safe and sound.

20:15.127 --> 20:16.799
That's all that matters.

20:17.967 --> 20:21.926
- Have you tried this thing?
- I get motion sickness, remember?

20:25.487 --> 20:28.524
Have you felt okay
since we were transported yesterday?

20:28.647 --> 20:32.686
Considering that I've been back down to
the surface, kidnapped and released...

20:33.847 --> 20:36.077
I've probably had better days.

20:36.647 --> 20:39.764
- Why, you not feeling well?
- I didn't think I was.

20:41.007 --> 20:44.682
But the Doctor seems to feel
my symptoms are psychological.

20:45.207 --> 20:48.517
- What kind of symptoms?
- Just haven't been myself.

20:48.967 --> 20:50.958
Everything's a little off.

20:52.407 --> 20:54.079
Even the laws of physics.

20:54.207 --> 20:58.200
Well, in that case, you're right.
You shouldn't get on this thing.

20:58.327 --> 21:01.444
The laws of physics
don't apply in here, either.

21:04.207 --> 21:06.675
Sorry, just trying to cheer you up.

21:07.847 --> 21:11.681
It's okay. Phlox promises me I'll be fine.

21:11.847 --> 21:15.681
It's going to be a while before any of us
gets used to being taken apart...

21:15.807 --> 21:17.923
and put back together again.

21:18.047 --> 21:20.800
Seems perfectly natural
to be anxious about it.

21:21.087 --> 21:23.442
I hope it's just a question
of being anxious.

21:24.767 --> 21:26.485
What else could it be?

21:27.287 --> 21:29.596
I saw my reflection become transparent.

21:30.727 --> 21:33.400
I saw water pass right through my hand.

21:33.807 --> 21:37.686
I'm not convinced that the transporter
put me back the way it's supposed to.

21:38.447 --> 21:40.961
All the King's horses
and all the King's men.

21:41.567 --> 21:44.604
I can see why you might imagine
the universe unravelling.

21:44.727 --> 21:47.287
If you're afraid you haven't been
put back together right...

21:47.407 --> 21:49.875
why assume
anything else makes sense?

21:50.487 --> 21:53.047
If I were you,
I'd ask the Doc for a sedative.

21:53.167 --> 21:55.237
Nothing like crawling into bed.

21:56.207 --> 21:58.721
- You men are all alike.
- No, wait and see.

21:58.847 --> 22:01.202
A night's sleep
will do you a world of good.

23:18.807 --> 23:21.640
Thank God you're here.
I've been stuck in here for hours.

23:21.767 --> 23:25.396
- The door control isn't...
- She was here last night, over there.

23:25.527 --> 23:26.846
Commander.

23:28.447 --> 23:30.836
- T'Pol to Captain Archer.
- Go ahead.

23:31.367 --> 23:33.597
Have the security details reported back?

23:33.727 --> 23:35.160
No sign of her yet.

23:37.407 --> 23:39.875
We've covered the forward section
of C-Deck.

23:40.207 --> 23:42.243
- She's not here.
- Yes, she is.

23:42.727 --> 23:45.036
Have you tried the bio-sensors again,
Captain?

23:45.167 --> 23:48.318
- Still nothing.
- I'll go take a look at them.

23:48.887 --> 23:52.243
I'm going to maintain our present orbit
until Hoshi turns up.

23:52.687 --> 23:55.565
- T'Pol, meet me in Sickbay right away.
- Yes, sir.

24:04.607 --> 24:07.246
She came to Sickbay
after the incident with the storm...

24:07.367 --> 24:09.961
then a second time, early last night.

24:11.247 --> 24:14.922
- She wasn't feeling well?
- She said she felt shaky.

24:15.047 --> 24:17.686
You're aware that was the first time
she'd ever transported?

24:17.807 --> 24:20.401
- Quite aware.
- I believe that caused her anxiety.

24:20.527 --> 24:24.315
She was convinced her molecules
hadn't been reassembled properly.

24:25.367 --> 24:27.437
I should have taken her more seriously.

24:27.567 --> 24:31.037
These are the bio-molecular scans
I took during each of her two visits.

24:31.167 --> 24:33.886
They seemed perfectly normal
at the time.

24:34.647 --> 24:38.526
When I heard she was missing,
something made me take a closer look.

24:39.167 --> 24:41.476
You see these protein filaments?

24:42.687 --> 24:45.155
Now, look at this.

24:51.207 --> 24:53.198
I'm gonna need some help here, Phlox.

24:53.327 --> 24:56.319
Look how much her sub-cellular
membranes have degraded.

24:56.647 --> 24:58.922
These scans were taken
less than 24 hours apart.

24:59.047 --> 25:00.924
It's virtually impossible.

25:01.607 --> 25:04.519
- What's impossible?
- Ensign Sato wasn't imagining it.

25:05.847 --> 25:07.963
Her molecules are coming apart.

25:11.967 --> 25:13.878
It's the secondary phase coils.

25:14.567 --> 25:17.240
- What about them?
- They're not aligning.

25:19.007 --> 25:21.202
They're not perfectly synchronised.

25:23.167 --> 25:25.761
Must have happened
right after I came up from the surface.

25:25.887 --> 25:27.923
If they're not perfectly synchronised...

25:28.047 --> 25:30.481
The re-sequencing
would start to dissipate.

25:30.607 --> 25:33.485
Within hours,
she'll lose molecular cohesion.

25:34.207 --> 25:36.163
She didn't want to go first.

25:36.687 --> 25:39.565
I told her I wouldn't leave her alone,
with that storm coming...

25:39.687 --> 25:41.598
but she insisted on going second.

25:41.727 --> 25:45.037
She wanted to be sure it was working,
that it was safe.

25:47.047 --> 25:49.197
I'm the one who should be missing.

25:49.327 --> 25:53.081
I told her to go first.
She should have listened to me.

25:53.687 --> 25:57.157
- It wasn't your fault.
- Take the transporter off-line...

25:58.087 --> 26:00.157
and figure out what went wrong.

26:02.007 --> 26:04.840
Starfleet promised me
this sort of thing wouldn't happen.

26:04.967 --> 26:06.719
- Aye, sir.
- Captain...

26:07.887 --> 26:10.117
if there was
a loss of molecular cohesion...

26:10.247 --> 26:13.557
I'm afraid we shouldn't be looking
for Hoshi per se.

26:15.047 --> 26:18.483
- What should we be looking for?
- Sub-cellular residue.

26:19.047 --> 26:23.165
There wouldn't be anything left by now
except for sub-cellular residue.

26:23.527 --> 26:26.041
You're wrong, Doctor.
I'm still in one piece.

26:26.887 --> 26:28.718
You just can't see me.

26:36.247 --> 26:38.966
Have the Doctor help you
recalibrate the sensors.

26:41.607 --> 26:43.802
Then start scanning for this...

26:46.607 --> 26:47.801
residue.

26:52.967 --> 26:54.287
- Archer to Mayweather.
- Go ahead, sir.

26:54.287 --> 26:55.436
- Archer to Mayweather.
- Go ahead, sir.

26:55.567 --> 26:58.923
Prepare to break orbit
and resume previous course.

26:59.407 --> 27:00.840
Aye, Captain.

27:04.847 --> 27:06.838
I'll be in my Ready Room.

27:15.487 --> 27:19.196
- There's no way to be certain this is her.
- Is it Hoshi's DNA or isn't it?

27:19.327 --> 27:22.444
It's difficult to tell.
The amino acids have broken down.

27:23.367 --> 27:25.642
Don't waste your time. It's not me.

27:26.007 --> 27:28.840
The internal scan said
Access Shaft B-7.

27:29.167 --> 27:31.203
She's got to be here somewhere.

27:33.967 --> 27:37.801
If you spent a little more time
trying to figure out what happened...

27:46.247 --> 27:48.966
- What's the problem?
- The stream's too unstable.

27:49.127 --> 27:50.480
Lieutenant?

27:50.647 --> 27:53.764
Come on, Hoshi.
It's as easy as one, two...

27:53.927 --> 27:56.043
Here, Doc. Over here.

28:01.047 --> 28:02.719
What do you think?

28:03.487 --> 28:05.364
Try isolating the dipeptides.

28:07.167 --> 28:10.000
Now run a comparison
with her genetic profile.

28:16.807 --> 28:18.843
Why would she have come down here?

28:19.687 --> 28:22.155
I doubt we'll ever know, Commander.

28:25.047 --> 28:29.484
Captain Archer will want
Hoshi's parents to have this.

28:31.247 --> 28:33.556
They're both alive, aren't they?

28:34.287 --> 28:36.164
Yeah. Both alive.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.759
You go ahead, Doc.

28:43.087 --> 28:46.397
I'm going to stick around for a minute.

28:47.887 --> 28:49.320
I understand.

28:59.047 --> 29:02.005
- Hoshi?
- You can see me?

29:02.647 --> 29:04.956
I should have made you go first.

29:07.887 --> 29:10.924
What could I have been thinking
leaving you down there?

29:11.887 --> 29:13.923
I was the ranking officer.

29:15.327 --> 29:19.115
I had no business leaving a subordinate
in the path of those storms.

29:19.607 --> 29:23.156
Why didn't you listen to me?
I told you we'd be safe.

29:28.247 --> 29:30.283
And now look what you've done.

30:29.127 --> 30:31.038
Captain, I need you to listen to me.

30:31.167 --> 30:33.283
There are aliens on board
from the surface.

30:33.407 --> 30:35.762
They're planting bombs on D-Deck.

30:37.447 --> 30:40.086
You've got to hear me.
The ship is in danger.

30:45.087 --> 30:47.681
- Go ahead.
- We've located her father, sir.

30:48.087 --> 30:49.918
The mother isn't home.

30:54.087 --> 30:56.555
- What time is it there?
- 0900.

31:00.647 --> 31:02.080
Put him through.

31:14.527 --> 31:16.961
- Good morning, sir.
- Captain Archer.

31:18.527 --> 31:20.404
Is everything all right?

31:20.847 --> 31:24.203
No, sir. Everything is not all right.

31:26.887 --> 31:29.765
We've had an accident
with our transporting device.

31:30.127 --> 31:32.880
Transporting device? What is that?

31:33.367 --> 31:36.882
- You don't have time for this.
- A matter stream converter.

31:37.087 --> 31:39.965
It was approved for transporting
bio-matter before we left Earth.

31:40.087 --> 31:41.918
Gotta find something
to get your attention.

31:42.047 --> 31:44.083
- We've used it a number of times...
- Bio-matter?

31:44.207 --> 31:46.641
What are you referring to,
produce or people?

31:46.927 --> 31:51.443
I'm just trying to explain to you
that Starfleet told us it was safe.

31:52.727 --> 31:56.083
- So, Hoshi's safe?
- No, sir.

31:57.087 --> 32:00.124
There was an accident. She began to...

32:04.487 --> 32:08.765
- Her molecules began to destabilise.
- Her molecules?

32:09.607 --> 32:12.883
- What are you talking about, Captain?
- This isn't easy, sir.

32:13.127 --> 32:15.595
I fought to get Hoshi
to come on this mission.

32:15.727 --> 32:18.002
I'm responsible for her being out here.

32:18.767 --> 32:21.679
She's become a member of our family.

32:22.247 --> 32:24.966
Family? We're her family, not you.

32:25.687 --> 32:27.405
Why are you calling me?

32:27.527 --> 32:29.916
To say that she has become
a member of your family?

32:30.047 --> 32:32.766
I'm sorry, Captain,
you are not making any sense.

32:33.807 --> 32:37.322
We lost Hoshi today, Mr Sato.

32:38.087 --> 32:42.763
- I wish I didn't have to tell you that.
- You are saying Hoshi is dead?

32:43.247 --> 32:46.205
We're all going to be dead
if I can't get him to notice this.

32:47.287 --> 32:49.801
Maybe you could call us back later.

32:50.807 --> 32:51.842
This afternoon.

32:51.967 --> 32:54.162
How about Morse code?
You know Morse code, don't you?

32:54.287 --> 32:56.039
I need time
to speak with Hoshi's mother.

32:56.167 --> 32:57.202
Come on, listen.

32:57.327 --> 32:59.363
- This afternoon.
- Can you hear it?

32:59.967 --> 33:02.845
- I'm so sorry.
- So am I.

33:09.207 --> 33:10.560
Come on.

33:13.927 --> 33:15.485
That's right.

33:15.887 --> 33:18.321
It's not supposed to be
making that noise, is it?

33:19.047 --> 33:21.083
Listen, you can hear it.

33:21.967 --> 33:24.356
SOS. It's a call for help.

33:25.487 --> 33:27.318
I need you to hear it.

33:33.167 --> 33:35.806
- Archer to T'Pol.
- Yes, Captain?

33:36.927 --> 33:38.918
- Could you come here for a minute?
- Right away.

33:39.047 --> 33:42.084
That's right, show it to her.
One of you will figure it out.

33:44.087 --> 33:45.486
Look at this.

33:47.967 --> 33:50.356
I've never heard it
make that noise before.

33:51.847 --> 33:53.963
The plasma circuit's being interrupted.

33:54.087 --> 33:56.362
I'll ask Commander Tucker
to take a look at it.

33:56.487 --> 33:58.443
Listen to the pattern.

33:59.087 --> 34:02.841
Three dots, three dashes, three dots.

34:04.567 --> 34:05.795
SOS.

34:07.927 --> 34:10.964
- Dots?
- Dots and dashes. Morse code.

34:11.286 --> 34:13.596
It's been used on Earth for centuries.

34:14.806 --> 34:16.445
It's a distress call.

34:16.967 --> 34:18.878
Let's see how good your memory is.

34:19.847 --> 34:23.078
- H-O...
- It's changed.

34:24.286 --> 34:27.757
...S- H...

34:28.047 --> 34:29.764
It still sounds like Morse code.

34:29.887 --> 34:32.355
...l. Come on.

34:32.527 --> 34:34.757
This plasma circuit is self-contained.

34:34.887 --> 34:37.844
No one outside of this room
could be using it to send a message.

34:37.967 --> 34:40.356
I'm not outside this room. I'm right here.

34:42.167 --> 34:46.159
It's been a very difficult day.
Perhaps you should get some rest.

34:49.367 --> 34:50.800
You're right.

34:53.567 --> 34:55.239
I'll have Trip look at it tomorrow.

34:55.367 --> 34:57.562
Tomorrow's too late.
They're gonna blow up the ship!

34:57.687 --> 34:59.166
Captain!

37:23.327 --> 37:24.555
No, wait!

37:34.727 --> 37:34.847
- What's the problem?
- What?

37:34.847 --> 37:36.485
- What's the problem?
- What?

37:37.207 --> 37:40.677
- The stream's too unstable.
- Come on, Hoshi, come on.

37:41.887 --> 37:45.675
You can do it, Ensign.
It's as easy as one, two...

37:47.087 --> 37:48.361
Three.

37:49.167 --> 37:52.842
Nice work, Malcolm.
I told you, piece of cake.

37:53.047 --> 37:54.685
Where are they?
We've got to stop them.

37:54.807 --> 37:55.922
Who?

37:56.207 --> 37:58.437
You heard me? You can hear me.
Do you see me?

37:58.567 --> 38:00.398
- Everything's fine, Hoshi.
- It's not fine.

38:00.527 --> 38:02.597
- They put a bomb on the warp reactor.
- Who?

38:02.727 --> 38:05.639
- The aliens from the surface.
- There's no one on the surface.

38:05.767 --> 38:07.803
- It's uninhabited.
- What are you talking about?

38:07.927 --> 38:10.680
They kidnapped you and Travis.
We've got to stop them.

38:10.807 --> 38:13.526
Hoshi, the transporter was affected
by the storms.

38:13.647 --> 38:16.366
I had some trouble
re-integrating your matter stream.

38:17.087 --> 38:18.315
Trouble?

38:18.447 --> 38:21.564
You were, sort of,
trapped in the pattern buffer...

38:22.007 --> 38:23.679
but only for a few seconds.

38:23.807 --> 38:25.877
8.3 seconds, to be precise.

38:26.967 --> 38:29.527
Are you saying that
I was just on the surface?

38:30.687 --> 38:32.723
You insisted on going second.

38:36.727 --> 38:38.797
- Do you have a mirror?
- What?

38:42.367 --> 38:43.686
Forget it.

38:44.967 --> 38:48.437
And I was sure I was going to be
the next Cyrus Ramsey.

38:48.567 --> 38:49.920
Cyrus who?

38:59.607 --> 39:02.883
So you're saying that
all of that happened in 8 seconds?

39:03.047 --> 39:06.403
Actually, it probably happened in
the last one or two seconds...

39:06.527 --> 39:09.997
as your matter stream was coalescing.
She seems fine.

39:13.327 --> 39:17.286
Malcolm's recommending some new
transport protocols to Starfleet.

39:18.447 --> 39:21.678
He's suggesting we start compressing
the transport beam.

39:22.567 --> 39:26.924
I hope you don't plan on beaming me
anywhere for a long time.

39:27.687 --> 39:31.646
But you said you stepped onto
the aliens' transporter by choice.

39:31.927 --> 39:34.043
I was trying to save Enterprise.

39:34.567 --> 39:38.321
- Sounds like you overcame your fear.
- It's all in my head, remember?

39:38.807 --> 39:40.445
Does it matter?

39:40.687 --> 39:43.918
You were afraid of getting lost,
afraid of disappearing...

39:44.047 --> 39:47.483
but you still climbed onto that platform,
real or not.

39:48.327 --> 39:50.602
If it's all the same to you, sir...

39:50.727 --> 39:53.799
I'd like to stick to shuttlepods
for the time being.

39:54.687 --> 39:55.915
Come on.

39:57.167 --> 39:58.646
Let's go to the Bridge.

39:58.767 --> 40:01.361
Captain... If you don't mind.
