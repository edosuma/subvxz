00:00.800 --> 00:02.768
Don't try what you're
about to see at home.

00:02.770 --> 00:04.336
We're what you call experts.

00:04.338 --> 00:05.804
Okay, go.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.072
Ooh!

00:08.074 --> 00:10.109
On this episode of "Mythbusters"...

00:10.111 --> 00:13.746
Gravity-defying legend
Nik Wallenda

00:13.748 --> 00:18.617
Prepares to master
mother nature's grandest canyon.

00:19.619 --> 00:20.953
This is tough.

00:20.955 --> 00:23.255
It's not just mental,
it's physical.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.524
A walk into history

00:25.526 --> 00:28.761
That Adam and Jamie are
on their way to witness...

00:28.763 --> 00:31.930
<i>Destination --</i>
<i>the roll in the rock.</i>

00:31.932 --> 00:34.433
<i>Turn right 200 yards.</i>

00:34.435 --> 00:35.701
...They hope.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.770
Where is everybody?

00:37.772 --> 00:39.405
I was just kind of expecting
more people.

00:39.407 --> 00:42.841
I mean, crossing the canyon
on a wire is, like, a big event.

00:43.309 --> 00:46.378
<i>Recalculating</i>
<i>destination.</i>

00:47.214 --> 00:49.148
This can't be right.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.283
<i>Destination --</i>
<i>roll in the rock.</i>

00:51.285 --> 00:53.185
<i>50 yards.</i>

00:53.187 --> 00:56.121
I'm not even sure
this is a road.

00:56.123 --> 01:00.926
<i>You have reached your</i>
<i>destination.</i>

01:00.928 --> 01:03.028
Thanks a lot, lady.

01:06.033 --> 01:07.332
There's your problem.

01:07.334 --> 01:09.835
Shall we call for backup?

01:09.837 --> 01:10.369
No signal.

01:10.371 --> 01:14.106
Great.
Let's go see where we are.

01:20.181 --> 01:20.846
Yeah, we're lost.

01:20.848 --> 01:24.283
Not only are we lost.
Our car is totally junked.

01:24.285 --> 01:27.219
We're out of gas and our
navigation's up the spout.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.054
Well,
what do you think's next?

01:29.957 --> 01:31.757
Got to figure out a way
to get out of here.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.560
Wouldn't it be nice if we had
a trunk full of duct tape?

01:37.398 --> 01:39.364
Oh, my arms
have about given out.

01:39.366 --> 01:41.600
Yep. Hold on to your hats.

01:43.636 --> 01:45.270
Come on.
Give me some of that.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.940
Can Adam
and Jamie's favorite fabric...

01:47.942 --> 01:51.210
Looks bad. Feels good.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.245
...Defeat desolate deserts...

01:53.247 --> 01:55.047
You're Nik Wallenda,
aren't you?

01:55.049 --> 01:56.348
I am one and the same.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.817
...Conquer colossal climbs...

01:58.819 --> 02:00.786
People do this
for recreation?!

02:00.788 --> 02:03.255
...And navigate
raging river rapids?

02:03.257 --> 02:04.756
aah!

02:04.758 --> 02:08.560
This is
the duct tape canyon special.

02:09.596 --> 02:11.763
Yeah!
whoo!

02:13.399 --> 02:16.268
Who are the Mythbusters?

02:16.970 --> 02:18.070
Adam Savage...

02:18.072 --> 02:20.072
This is science in action.

02:20.074 --> 02:22.107
...And Jamie Hyneman.

02:22.109 --> 02:22.608
Bye-bye.

02:22.610 --> 02:27.412
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

02:27.414 --> 02:30.449
Together with Grant Imahara...

02:30.451 --> 02:32.584
That is crazy!

02:32.586 --> 02:33.519
...Kari Byron...

02:34.455 --> 02:35.621
...And Tory Belleci.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.556
Come along
for the journey.

02:37.558 --> 02:40.692
They don't just tell
the myths.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.661
They put them to the test.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.797

Captions paid for by
Discovery Communications

02:49.336 --> 02:52.504
Pack your packaging,
put on your prom wear --

02:52.506 --> 02:57.676
It's "Mythbusters"
versus wild west.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.645
As we've made obvious
in the past,

02:59.647 --> 03:02.314
We have a passion
for the duct tape.

03:02.316 --> 03:03.282
It's handy stuff.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.850
Fun for the whole family.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.252
We've used it
to make a sailboat.

03:07.254 --> 03:07.853
Yee-haw!

03:07.855 --> 03:09.388
We've used it
to make a bridge...

03:09.390 --> 03:11.390
A cannon...

03:11.392 --> 03:12.457
...A crash barrier...
Ah!

03:12.459 --> 03:14.726
...We've used it to escape
from a deserted island.

03:16.564 --> 03:19.698
And since we've proven it's
the ultimate survival tool,

03:19.700 --> 03:21.300
We never leave home
without it.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.167
Which is lucky,
because

03:22.169 --> 03:24.303
Before we got interrupted
by the opening credits,

03:24.305 --> 03:26.438
We were dressed for success
and heading on our way

03:26.440 --> 03:29.408
To watch Nik Wallenda
walk across the grand canyon.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.343
But our gps had other plans,

03:31.345 --> 03:34.880
Steered us to the canyon's edge
in the middle of nowhere

03:34.882 --> 03:37.616
With nothing but a trunk
full of duct tape.

03:37.618 --> 03:38.450
We need a plan.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.084
Well, that's easy.

03:39.086 --> 03:40.886
All we have to do
is go down to the river

03:40.888 --> 03:43.088
And follow it
back to civilization.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.289
Exactly.

03:44.291 --> 03:45.991
That's -- what? What?

03:47.861 --> 03:50.862
Okay, apparently it's
not gonna happen that way.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.664
Meddling producers.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.600
seriously?

03:54.602 --> 03:56.001
okay.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.971
All right, so apparently
we're not at the canyon's edge.

03:58.973 --> 04:01.173
We are stranded literally
in the middle of nowhere.

04:01.175 --> 04:02.307
We have to go find
the canyon

04:02.309 --> 04:03.909
And the temperature is hovering,
where?

04:03.911 --> 04:06.445
yeah, right around zero.

04:06.447 --> 04:06.778
Hmm.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.180
Well, fortunately,
I brought along

04:08.182 --> 04:09.915
A bunch
of extra bubble pack.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.550
Excellent.
I love that stuff, too.

04:11.552 --> 04:12.751
Well,
I guess all that's left

04:12.753 --> 04:14.720
Is for us to get zapped
back out there.

04:14.722 --> 04:17.289
So, editors,
will you do our honors?

04:19.158 --> 04:20.158
That was weird.

04:20.160 --> 04:20.791
Artistic license.

04:20.793 --> 04:24.596
All right, so our car's out
of gas, our gps doesn't work,

04:24.598 --> 04:29.001
We're dressed to the nines,
and we are completely lost.

04:29.003 --> 04:30.035
What do we do?

04:30.037 --> 04:31.837
Maybe we should take
inventory --

04:31.839 --> 04:33.272
See what we've got
to work with.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.139
Good enough. Let's do it.

04:34.141 --> 04:37.843
Yep, the first task
for our tuxedoed twosome

04:37.845 --> 04:39.544
Is to take stock.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.446
Jackpot.

04:41.448 --> 04:45.450
Because when stranded in
a remote and hostile location,

04:45.452 --> 04:48.220
It's the first
and most fundamental step

04:48.222 --> 04:53.091
Of any survival strategy --
assess your equipment.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.427
I found jelly beans.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.062
Oh, great.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.363
And beef jerky.

04:58.365 --> 05:00.132
Food and water is a start,

05:00.134 --> 05:03.969
But the real prize is
Jamie's stash of sticky stuff...

05:03.971 --> 05:05.437
What the...?

05:05.439 --> 05:06.905
...And packing that pops.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.674
I don't go anywhere
without duct tape.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.609
Wait till you see what I got
in the other bag.

05:10.611 --> 05:14.179
Over the years, I've
become really fond of duct tape,

05:14.181 --> 05:15.147
But there's one other material

05:15.149 --> 05:18.750
That I've added to my list --
bubble packing.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.353
You never know
when it'll come in handy.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.654
How about now?

05:22.656 --> 05:26.024
Because some hot couture
is required.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.492
Now, we're in the high desert,

05:27.494 --> 05:29.828
And you'd expect it
to be pretty hot.

05:29.830 --> 05:30.529
It is not hot at all.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.431
In fact, the temperature
out here is hovering

05:32.433 --> 05:34.633
Right around
0 degrees celsius --

05:34.635 --> 05:35.934
32 degrees fahrenheit.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.336
And while the tuxedo
does a fine job

05:37.338 --> 05:39.805
Of making me look darn good...

05:39.807 --> 05:42.174
...I am freezing my tuckus off.

05:42.176 --> 05:45.610
Luckily, we brought
a terrific insulator with us

05:45.612 --> 05:47.846
In the form
of this bubble packaging.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.514
You need some duct tape?

05:49.516 --> 05:49.981
Sure.

05:49.983 --> 05:52.918
The dynamic duo to the rescue.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.252
Tuckus-freezing temperatures

05:54.254 --> 05:57.089
Means plastic ponchos
all around.

05:57.091 --> 05:59.091
One of my favorite things.

05:59.093 --> 06:01.626
Looks bad. Feels good.

06:01.628 --> 06:05.731
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
at how effective this is,

06:05.733 --> 06:06.531
But I am.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.100
Gloves!

06:08.102 --> 06:09.568
These little air bubbles

06:09.570 --> 06:12.404
Are just like the bubbles
in foam rubber,

06:12.406 --> 06:13.772
And so, it's very insulating.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.775
With our
now less-than-debonair duo

06:16.777 --> 06:20.045
Cloaked against the cold,
it's time to take action.

06:20.047 --> 06:26.785
Cue the slow-mo for a dramatic,
cinematic scouting mission.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.855
Now, we know we're
in canyonland,

06:29.857 --> 06:30.989
And where there's a canyon,

06:30.991 --> 06:32.457
There's usually a river
at the bottom of it.

06:32.459 --> 06:37.629
And that'll be our most direct
route back to civilization.

06:37.631 --> 06:40.098
Hey,
that's what we want.

06:40.100 --> 06:44.436
But the thing is, we don't know
exactly where it is.

06:44.438 --> 06:47.205
So I figure we need
to find some high ground

06:47.207 --> 06:51.376
And see if we can get
a better view of the terrain.

06:51.378 --> 06:52.911
Oh, yeah.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.946
Not just better.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.716
The view is breathtaking...

06:57.718 --> 06:58.950
Literally.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.485
It's beautiful up here.

07:00.487 --> 07:03.255
hold on a second while I...

07:03.257 --> 07:03.889
Catch your breath.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.324
Have a heart attack
is what I was thinking.

07:06.326 --> 07:10.095
Heart-attack inducing,
but it was worth the effort.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.330
Salvation is in sight.

07:12.332 --> 07:14.299
There's our canyon.

07:14.301 --> 07:15.000
That's it all right.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.234
Oh, I'm glad
this was worth it.

07:16.236 --> 07:19.271
Well, it looks like
it's a long ways off,

07:19.273 --> 07:21.139
But now we know
here we're headed,

07:21.141 --> 07:23.375
So it's time to head
back to base camp

07:23.377 --> 07:24.576
And make
some preparations.

07:24.578 --> 07:27.813
And back at the broken-down car,

07:27.815 --> 07:29.414
There's two types of news.

07:29.416 --> 07:32.184
The good news is
we know where we're going.

07:32.186 --> 07:32.918
The bad news is there's

07:32.920 --> 07:34.619
Only a couple of hours
of daylight left,

07:34.621 --> 07:37.155
Which means we can't set out
until the morning.

07:37.157 --> 07:40.192
Shelter and warmth are crucial.

07:40.194 --> 07:44.696
So Jamie begins by building
a duct-tape bivouac.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.031
Well, that's one.

07:46.033 --> 07:49.100
With a bunch more,
I'll have myself a tent.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.703
And bright spark Adam,

07:51.705 --> 07:56.007
Planning on camping in the car,
has an idea.

07:56.009 --> 07:56.608
Freedom.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.743
Our sat-and-nav electrics
may be up the spout,

07:58.745 --> 07:59.778
But I'm willing to bet
this battery

07:59.780 --> 08:02.614
Still has enough charge
to create a spark.

08:02.616 --> 08:05.717
As long as I can create a spark,
I can make a fire.

08:05.719 --> 08:06.985
That's the theory.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.721
Okay, okay. Calm down.
Everybody calm down.

08:09.723 --> 08:12.624
But the wires
are too hot to handle.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.192
Look at how hot
I'm getting this.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.894
It's melting the cover
right off.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.762
It's getting hard to hold,
actually.

08:17.764 --> 08:18.430
Duct tape to the rescue.

08:18.432 --> 08:21.800
A little bit of insulation
from his favorite fabric

08:21.802 --> 08:25.170
Provides handy handles,
meaning...

08:25.172 --> 08:27.973
There it is! Come on.

08:27.975 --> 08:31.443
You can totally do this.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.914
This is happening for real.

08:35.916 --> 08:36.448
Oh, my gosh.

08:36.450 --> 08:39.751
Meanwhile, with the cold night
rapidly closing in,

08:39.753 --> 08:42.821
Jamie's shelter favors function
over form.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.690
This wasn't exactly what
I had in mind as far as a tent,

08:45.692 --> 08:48.326
But it'll keep the dew
off of me,

08:48.328 --> 08:49.361
It'll keep the wind off,

08:49.363 --> 08:53.331
And with a sleeping bag
made out of bubble packing,

08:53.333 --> 08:54.599
I'll be good to go.

08:54.601 --> 08:57.736
Yep, they started out stranded,

08:57.738 --> 09:01.172
Lost in the unforgiving expanse
of the canyonlands,

09:01.174 --> 09:04.242
But with a little
mythbusting ingenuity,

09:04.244 --> 09:06.211
Come sunset...

09:06.213 --> 09:07.679
Not a bad day.

09:07.681 --> 09:11.650
...They have
a romantic, fire-lit dinner...

09:11.652 --> 09:12.217
Jelly bean?

09:12.219 --> 09:13.952
...Know where they're headed...

09:13.954 --> 09:15.887
Tomorrow,
to the canyons.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.256
...And a cozy campsite for two.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.558
We're gonna be toasty.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.092
Duct tape and bubble pack --

09:21.094 --> 09:24.329
The choice
for all discerning survivors.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.864
This is just like a duvet.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.465
Good night, Jamie.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.501
Good night.

09:29.503 --> 09:31.202
Good night.

09:37.476 --> 09:42.247
But when day two does dawn,
our desperate duo...

09:42.249 --> 09:43.014
Water's all gone.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.883
...Will discover
just what it takes

09:44.885 --> 09:49.688
To conquer the hard,
cold canyonlands.

09:51.000 --> 09:57.074

10:03.836 --> 10:06.538
The canyonlands --

10:06.540 --> 10:10.542
Spectacularly,
breathtakingly beautiful.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.679
But also terrifying terrain.

10:14.681 --> 10:19.784
Remote, hostile, and barren --

10:19.786 --> 10:23.021
Clearly not somewhere
to be stranded...

10:23.023 --> 10:24.556
We are completely lost.

10:24.558 --> 10:26.358
...At least,
not without a good supply

10:26.360 --> 10:28.627
Of life-saving sticky stuff...

10:29.229 --> 10:32.797
...And Jamie's favorite
plastic packaging.

10:32.799 --> 10:33.932
Thank you, sir.

10:33.934 --> 10:38.169
And the cold and wet morning
sees our dapperly dressed duo

10:38.171 --> 10:40.605
In surprisingly good shape.

10:40.607 --> 10:42.340
Ah.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.542
So the sun has come out
just a little bit.

10:44.544 --> 10:47.278
It's warming up, and we are
hiking to the canyon today,

10:47.280 --> 10:49.981
And that means we've got to
pack up as much of this stuff

10:49.983 --> 10:51.683
As we could possibly carry.

10:51.685 --> 10:54.753
Jamie is making some kind
of a sled that we can drag.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.988
I'm going to make
a shoulder-sling messenger bag

10:56.990 --> 11:01.593
To carry all the small stuff,
and then we hit the road.

11:01.595 --> 11:04.062
From their
vantage point yesterday,

11:04.064 --> 11:06.631
Their route back
to civilization, the canyon,

11:06.633 --> 11:09.534
Looks to be a tough trek
of 15 miles.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.770
And at the end of it,
they'll need to get

11:11.772 --> 11:14.339
All their supplies
down to the river.

11:14.341 --> 11:20.045
So our tuxedoed soon-to-be
pack mules go to work.

11:20.047 --> 11:22.414
I think this last bit
ought to be about enough.

11:22.416 --> 11:26.551
This thing right here
is the start of a travois.

11:26.553 --> 11:31.089
What I'm gonna be doing
is making two of these things

11:31.091 --> 11:33.058
Lashed together like a ladder,

11:33.060 --> 11:36.728
So I can grab them like so
and drag them.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.530
Hopefully,
this will be strong enough

11:38.532 --> 11:41.466
Thanks to all this duct tape
to hold it together.

11:41.468 --> 11:44.302
It's about the most efficient
way that I know of

11:44.304 --> 11:48.139
To improvise a heavy
load-carrying capability.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.041
I don't know
that you'd want to go

11:50.043 --> 11:51.810
Through the airport
with one of these,

11:51.812 --> 11:53.545
But across this kind of terrain,

11:53.547 --> 11:56.448
It actually is gonna be
quite useful.

11:56.450 --> 11:57.982
Yeah, that's not too bad at all.

11:57.984 --> 11:59.918
Not bad,
but when Jamie reinvents

11:59.920 --> 12:04.289
The duct-tape roll as a wheel,
it's much better.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.491
I don't know how long
they're gonna last,

12:06.493 --> 12:09.060
But that's a fraction
of the work to pull.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.429
Meanwhile,
having nailed

12:11.431 --> 12:15.366
This season's hottest handbag,
Adam's thinking ahead.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.634
Now that we're trudging out,

12:16.636 --> 12:19.270
One of the things we're
gonna need a lot of is rope.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.172
So Adam gets a-twirling.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.942
Luckily, I was a cheerleader
in high school.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.444
And with the rope
wound, stacked, and packed,

12:26.446 --> 12:28.046
Along with the rest
of their supplies,

12:28.048 --> 12:32.083
Our formally dressed
frontiersmen hit the trail...

12:32.085 --> 12:34.219
Bye, car.
Thanks for nothing.

12:34.221 --> 12:37.288
...With their travois.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.423
How's it feel?

12:38.425 --> 12:38.923
It's not bad.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.992
It's gonna get old
after a while, though.

12:41.461 --> 12:46.564
And so begins the long,
dusty slog through the desert.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.700
Thanks
to yesterday's scouting mission,

12:48.702 --> 12:49.901
They know where they're going.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.936
But with limited supplies
of food and water

12:51.938 --> 12:56.908
And a heavy load to lug,
it ain't gonna be easy.

12:56.910 --> 12:57.709
Well, I tell you what.

12:57.711 --> 13:02.647
There's not really a better way
of doing this, but it's hard.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.749
I'm gonna have a workout.

13:04.751 --> 13:08.253
Several hours in
and what's not working out

13:08.255 --> 13:10.588
Is the formal footwear.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.090
Not exactly hiking shoes.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.125
But a little extra toe room...

13:14.127 --> 13:17.228
Ah.
That actually is a lot nicer.

13:17.230 --> 13:20.732
...And some all-purpose
packaging sand-proofing,

13:20.734 --> 13:22.867
And they're on the road again.

13:22.869 --> 13:25.703
All right.
Mush, doggy.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.739
Problem is, it's not a road.

13:27.741 --> 13:31.342
And barely halfway there,
their supplies are exhausted.

13:31.344 --> 13:35.647
hey...Want to stop
for a drink of water?

13:35.649 --> 13:36.848
Water's all gone.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.783
pushing on.

13:38.785 --> 13:43.488
Then the hard-packed plateau
peters out to soft sand

13:43.490 --> 13:48.626
And the desert drudgery
begins to take a real toll.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.528
If they're gonna make it
to the canyon...

13:50.530 --> 13:52.230
Let's get out of the wind
for a minute.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.499
...They need to re-energize.

13:54.501 --> 13:59.404
Being dehydrated in the desert
is a one-way ticket to delirium.

13:59.406 --> 14:02.941
And Adam's no exception.

14:07.746 --> 14:09.013
Wait a minute.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.682
You're balancing on a --

14:10.684 --> 14:12.483
You're Nik Wallenda,
aren't you?

14:12.485 --> 14:15.019
I am one and the same.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.421
What are you doing here?

14:16.423 --> 14:20.692
Searching. Same as you.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.896
I don't know
what I'm searching for.

14:25.731 --> 14:28.600
None of us know
what we're looking for.

14:28.602 --> 14:30.335
Oh.
Wait a minute.

14:30.337 --> 14:33.471
Is this like one of
those southwest vision quest

14:33.473 --> 14:34.873
Kind of things?

14:36.008 --> 14:36.574
Awesome.

14:36.576 --> 14:40.712
You do know that you're in
the wrong state, though, right?

14:40.714 --> 14:42.080
This isn't the grand canyon.
This is utah.

14:42.082 --> 14:45.283
No, I'm pretty sure this is
the grand canyon.

14:45.285 --> 14:48.186
It's your gps that screwed up,
not mine.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.788
Anyway,
I got to get ready.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.557
After Adam awakes,

14:52.559 --> 14:55.426
Courtesy of
some duct-tape finger gloves,

14:55.428 --> 14:59.330
Jamie's scavenged
a prickly pear lunch.

14:59.332 --> 15:02.533
that's delicious.

15:02.535 --> 15:05.236
Yeah, it's like kiwi
or something.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.305
Nicely done.

15:08.607 --> 15:12.477
With our tuxedoed trekkers
rejuvenated,

15:12.479 --> 15:14.646
They resume their March.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.816
And two hours later,

15:18.818 --> 15:22.420
They finally reach
their destination,

15:22.422 --> 15:26.257
Where a welcome sight awaits.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.461
Look at that.

15:30.463 --> 15:34.265
There she is.

15:37.369 --> 15:40.438
The thing about
these kinds of settings

15:40.440 --> 15:42.340
Is they're so beautiful

15:42.342 --> 15:45.276
At the same time
as they're terrifying.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.644
I mean, just look at that.

15:46.646 --> 15:51.215
Well, after our day of trekking,
we have found our river,

15:51.217 --> 15:54.285
And it's only two
football fields away from us.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.020
The problem is -- straight down.

15:56.022 --> 15:59.324
The route to the river
is not immediately obvious,

15:59.326 --> 16:03.061
So we're gonna set out looking
first thing in the morning.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.663
'night, Jamie.

16:06.966 --> 16:10.101
Good night.

16:10.103 --> 16:10.835
Coming up,

16:10.837 --> 16:16.174
With the sun,
Adam and Jamie are going down.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.176
Ah

16:38.398 --> 16:40.231
Welcome back
to the "Mythbusters"

16:40.233 --> 16:41.299
Duct tape canyon special.

16:41.301 --> 16:42.033
So far in this episode,

16:42.035 --> 16:43.901
Jamie and I have been stranded
far from civilization

16:43.903 --> 16:46.838
With only duct tape
and bubble packaging

16:46.840 --> 16:49.107
To get ourselves back to safety.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.808
Look at that.

16:50.810 --> 16:53.611
Now it's time to break out
all the duct tape

16:53.613 --> 16:55.580
And duct-tape rope
that we've got

16:55.582 --> 16:58.049
To get ourselves
to the bottom of this canyon.

16:58.051 --> 17:01.552
It sounds easy,

17:01.554 --> 17:05.156
But rappelling the 150-foot
cliff face to salvation

17:05.157 --> 17:09.093
Is gonna be one of
the most challenging experiences

17:09.095 --> 17:11.496
Of their mythbusting lives.

17:11.498 --> 17:15.233
But it's their only way out.

17:15.234 --> 17:17.502
All right,
let's start laying it out.

17:17.503 --> 17:23.040
And success depends
on the strength and length

17:23.042 --> 17:24.108
Of their duct-tape rope.

17:24.109 --> 17:27.478
But it looks like what we've got
is about 250 feet,

17:27.480 --> 17:29.280
Which is fantastic,
'cause it looks like

17:29.282 --> 17:31.582
It's about 150
to the bottom with knots.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.451
It's just enough rope.

17:33.453 --> 17:34.085
Whew!

17:34.087 --> 17:37.088
So it's long enough,
now, is it strong enough?

17:37.090 --> 17:41.025
We've ended up making a lot
of duct-tape rope on this show,

17:41.027 --> 17:42.160
And on "Duct Tape Bridge,"

17:42.162 --> 17:44.262
We actually did
a strength test of it,

17:44.264 --> 17:46.697
And we found
that a single strand of tape

17:46.699 --> 17:50.334
Was capable of supporting
about 70 pounds.

17:50.336 --> 17:51.269
Oh!

17:51.271 --> 17:54.172
67.3 pounds of force.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.106
Oh!

17:55.108 --> 17:57.108
And each of these ropes
has four strands in it,

17:57.110 --> 18:00.311
Giving them a breaking strength
of about 280 pounds each.

18:00.313 --> 18:03.147
Add three of them together,
and you get 840 pounds.

18:03.149 --> 18:06.084
But you've to got remove
about 40% of that strength

18:06.086 --> 18:07.885
Because you've put a knot
in the rope.

18:07.887 --> 18:10.922
In the end, we get
a safety ratio of about 3:1.

18:10.924 --> 18:13.524
It's less than ideal,
but hopefully it's enough.

18:13.526 --> 18:16.694
And with Jamie
strapped in his safety harness,

18:16.696 --> 18:20.098
It's time for the rope ride
of a lifetime.

18:20.100 --> 18:23.101
But it certainly won't be
a joyride.

18:23.103 --> 18:25.736
Height is not
the Hyneman's friend.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.539
I've ended up doing
a fair amount of climbing

18:28.541 --> 18:29.207
Throughout my life,

18:29.209 --> 18:32.477
But the thing is,
I absolutely hate it.

18:32.479 --> 18:35.446
I don't mind saying
I'm hyperventilating.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.483
When I'm anywhere near
the edge of a cliff,

18:38.485 --> 18:42.286
My mind is just going over
and over and over

18:42.288 --> 18:44.455
What it would feel like to be
in free fall

18:44.457 --> 18:47.425
With a sudden stop
at the bottom.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.360
Okay, Adam,
you've got the other end.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.562
Don't let go.
I won't.

18:51.564 --> 18:56.000
But if you focus
on what's right in front of you

18:56.002 --> 18:58.603
And do your best
to blank everything else out,

18:58.605 --> 19:02.140
You can pretty much do
whatever you have to.

19:04.944 --> 19:07.478
But I'm unhappy.

19:08.780 --> 19:10.615
Jamie hesitates.

19:11.151 --> 19:14.118
Steeling himself
for the 150-foot climb,

19:14.120 --> 19:17.555
Or, if things go south,
the 150-foot drop.

19:17.557 --> 19:21.325
Yep,
it's a long way down.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.227
Well...

19:23.229 --> 19:24.762
Now or never.

19:24.764 --> 19:28.232
Here we go.

19:31.237 --> 19:32.837
That's the moment --

19:32.839 --> 19:37.308
The moment Jamie's weight
is suspended over the abyss.

19:39.478 --> 19:40.378
I got a foothold.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.447
Well, so far so good.

19:43.449 --> 19:46.584
A mere 145 feet to go.

19:46.586 --> 19:50.721
I'm good Adam. Okay.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.090
Jamie's supporting
his own weight

19:53.092 --> 19:54.992
On the three-strand
duct-tape rope.

19:54.994 --> 19:57.962
It's hard work,
and a rest is welcome.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.164
Okay, stop.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.332
Okay, holding on.

20:01.334 --> 20:05.536
There's a ledge
about 25 feet down or so

20:05.538 --> 20:08.506
If you need a place to rest.

20:08.508 --> 20:11.108
Okay,
I'm gonna go over it.

20:11.110 --> 20:13.544
From here on...

20:14.714 --> 20:20.585
...Every single one
of the remaining 125 feet...

20:22.888 --> 20:25.890
this is a long way down.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.191
...Is all free fall.

20:27.193 --> 20:31.062
Oh, my arms
have about given out.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.439
Slowly but surely...

20:41.441 --> 20:45.443
Handhold by handhold...

20:45.445 --> 20:48.212
Grunt by grunt...

20:48.214 --> 20:51.482
Almost there.

20:51.484 --> 20:56.487
...The Hyneman
conquers the canyon.

21:01.661 --> 21:03.728
I made it!

21:03.730 --> 21:04.462
Awesome!

21:04.464 --> 21:07.164
And I can't believe
how far that was.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.667
The duct tape worked, though.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.636
I can't believe that I'm here.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.604
And alive.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.307
Once again,
duct tape did the job...

21:17.310 --> 21:19.677
And...
Here it comes!

21:19.679 --> 21:20.044
Whoo.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.613
...With their supplies
unceremoniously slung

21:22.615 --> 21:25.616
Over the side, it's Adam's turn.

21:25.618 --> 21:26.350
Here I come!

21:26.352 --> 21:28.853
this is it.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.254
Everything of ours

21:30.256 --> 21:32.523
Is now at the bottom
of this canyon

21:32.525 --> 21:33.858
Except for me.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.694
Ah

21:36.696 --> 21:40.031
This is

21:40.033 --> 21:41.499
Ah

21:42.802 --> 21:43.601
I need a minute.

21:43.603 --> 21:45.870
It's time for me
to make the journey.

21:45.872 --> 21:48.372
I can't wait for this
to be over. I'm serious.

21:48.374 --> 21:51.809
I can't wait for this
to be over.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.511
Aah!

21:53.513 --> 21:54.845
Okay. Oh, god.

21:54.847 --> 21:57.048
Oh, there's a foothold
right there.

21:57.050 --> 21:59.283
Oh,
that's a nice foothold.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.421
Calm people live.

22:03.423 --> 22:04.822
Calm people live.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.024
Once past that convenient ledge,

22:07.026 --> 22:08.759
It's just Mythbusters' ingenuity

22:08.761 --> 22:12.063
Between Adam
and a grizzly date with gravity.

22:12.065 --> 22:15.099
Whoo. Whoo.
Whoo ho-ho-ho!

22:15.101 --> 22:20.304
Oh! Oh! Oh [bleep]

22:20.306 --> 22:21.806
Yeah.

22:23.209 --> 22:27.812
The surging adrenaline seems
to be making him extra chatty.

22:27.814 --> 22:30.247
People do this
for recreation?!

22:30.249 --> 22:34.018
He's certainly
a lot more vocal than Jamie was.

22:34.654 --> 22:38.422
My nuts are killing me --
what's left of them.

22:38.424 --> 22:40.224
And the tight harness
could be the reason

22:40.226 --> 22:45.529
His voice is several octaves
higher than usual.

22:45.531 --> 22:47.465
The view
is really quite lovely.

22:47.467 --> 22:49.100
Couple things --

22:49.102 --> 22:53.003
Our duct-tape rope is
really nice and strong

22:53.005 --> 22:56.240
And wide enough
to get a good grip on.

22:58.177 --> 22:59.577
Nice work.

22:59.579 --> 23:02.012
Second of all, the worst part,

23:02.014 --> 23:05.182
The <i>worst</i> part
is the very first one.

23:05.184 --> 23:06.751
Just sitting on the ledge
of that rock

23:06.753 --> 23:10.354
And knowing that you've got to
swing yourself over open space.

23:10.356 --> 23:12.189
I made the mistake
of looking down,

23:12.191 --> 23:14.525
And my whole body is like,
"nope.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.093
Nope."

23:16.095 --> 23:16.761
I need a minute.

23:16.763 --> 23:18.629
And your brain is like,
"we're gonna do it,"

23:18.631 --> 23:20.431
And your body's like, "nope."

23:21.000 --> 23:22.366
And you have
this whole discussion.

23:22.368 --> 23:23.334
I actually needed
an extra moment

23:23.336 --> 23:27.705
Just to make sure that my brain
was in charge, and it was.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.473
And then slowly made our way
down.

23:29.475 --> 23:31.909
The rope was beautiful.
It bounced a little bit.

23:31.911 --> 23:35.179
Wow. It is seriously bouncy
at this point.

23:35.181 --> 23:35.880
And minutes later,

23:35.882 --> 23:40.584
I'm standing solidly
on beautiful terra firma.

23:43.623 --> 23:46.223
Whew!
That first step.

23:46.825 --> 23:48.392
I know
this is a family show,

23:48.394 --> 23:50.761
But that first step
is [bleep] up.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.496
That was really rough.

23:52.498 --> 23:53.564
Whoo ho-ho-ho!

23:53.566 --> 23:56.500
Yep, they're down
and on their way,

23:56.502 --> 23:59.170
But that's one duct-tape tale

23:59.172 --> 24:01.772
That will stay with them
forever.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.742
I made it!

24:06.211 --> 24:08.312
Do not try what you're
about to see at home.

24:08.314 --> 24:10.815
We consult with experts,
we take every precaution,

24:10.817 --> 24:15.019
And we have years of experience
in dangerous situations.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.562
in 2012,

24:24.564 --> 24:27.264
Two men were marooned,
destined to die.

24:27.266 --> 24:30.201
Well, it's been
almost a full day without water.

24:30.203 --> 24:31.602
it's hard.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.938
But when luck surfed up...

24:33.940 --> 24:36.707
With this much duct tape,
we are set!

24:36.709 --> 24:41.745
...They rejected that reality
and substituted their own.

24:41.747 --> 24:42.580
Oh!

24:42.582 --> 24:44.815
Dude! Land!

24:44.817 --> 24:46.383
This year...

24:46.385 --> 24:50.054
Lightning has struck twice.

24:50.056 --> 24:53.090
Look at that.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.893
But in the cold canyonlands

24:55.895 --> 24:58.929
With nothing but packaging
and prom wear...

25:00.031 --> 25:03.901
...Will mother nature bite back?

25:03.903 --> 25:05.302
Ah

25:06.105 --> 25:08.506
Whoo ho-ho-ho!

25:09.876 --> 25:11.308
well, no.

25:11.310 --> 25:14.144
Because thanks
to their favorite fabrics,

25:14.146 --> 25:16.580
Our men in black
have made camp...

25:16.582 --> 25:17.515
Good night.

25:17.517 --> 25:18.082
...Made progress,

25:18.084 --> 25:22.553
And made Jamie go weak
at the knees.

25:27.827 --> 25:31.662
And having walked
that tightrope of terror...

25:33.064 --> 25:34.465
Think it's that way.

25:35.735 --> 25:39.937
...Things are looking up.

25:39.939 --> 25:41.472
Finally.

25:41.474 --> 25:42.339
That is a relief.

25:42.341 --> 25:45.776
Now, that's a sight
for sore feet.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.745
And shoulders.

25:47.747 --> 25:50.481
The reason
it's such a soothing sight

25:50.483 --> 25:55.085
Is this red river could spell
the end of their desert trail.

25:55.087 --> 25:58.188
Well, after our ordeal
of trudging down the canyon,

25:58.190 --> 26:01.325
We have reached the river
at the canyon's bottom.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.193
This is not
our final destination.

26:03.195 --> 26:03.928
This is just hopefully

26:03.930 --> 26:07.631
The highway
to our final destination.

26:07.866 --> 26:09.934
So we've got to make
our way down the river.

26:09.936 --> 26:12.336
Clearly, that means
another duct-tape boat.

26:12.338 --> 26:13.270
You know, not necessarily.

26:13.272 --> 26:17.408
I mean, what if we wrapped
ourselves in the bubble packing

26:17.410 --> 26:21.745
And made sort of like
a big floaty wet suit?

26:22.214 --> 26:25.082
It would keep us warm,
it would allow us to float.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.016
We'd get a lot of control.

26:26.018 --> 26:28.452
I mean, it's not like you're
gonna fall out of the boat.

26:28.955 --> 26:31.855
All right,
why don't we do a test?

26:31.857 --> 26:33.190
Sure.
Okay.

26:33.192 --> 26:33.657
Yee-haw!

26:33.659 --> 26:36.226
When it comes
to crafting duct-tape craft...

26:36.228 --> 26:38.395
scotty, I need more power.

26:38.397 --> 26:41.131
...The Mythbusters
have extensive experience.

26:42.835 --> 26:45.703
Today, they're keeping it simple

26:45.705 --> 26:48.772
As they literally wrap Adam up
in bubble pack...

26:48.774 --> 26:50.140
That's gonna be awesome.

26:50.142 --> 26:51.842
...Before sealing him
with tape.

26:51.844 --> 26:53.711
it just has to keep you warm

26:53.713 --> 26:55.045
And allow you to float.

26:55.047 --> 26:58.882
It's about as basic
as you can get...

26:58.884 --> 27:00.351
I think you're good.

27:00.353 --> 27:02.086
...But maybe it's enough.

27:02.088 --> 27:06.023
I have a theory
that it's much more efficient

27:06.025 --> 27:07.358
To wrap ourselves
in the bubble packaging

27:07.360 --> 27:10.527
And duct tape
rather than try and make boats.

27:10.529 --> 27:11.261
I'm about to do a test.

27:11.263 --> 27:13.330
We're gonna see how well
this both floats me

27:13.332 --> 27:15.065
And, more importantly,
insulates me

27:15.067 --> 27:17.468
Against this
nearly freezing-cold water.

27:17.470 --> 27:18.602
I got the other end.

27:18.604 --> 27:20.170
All right, don't let go.

27:21.240 --> 27:24.742
At first, Adam seems
to be enjoying himself.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.344
But not for long.

27:29.649 --> 27:31.649
Aah! Aah! Aah! Oh!

27:31.651 --> 27:34.485
Ohh,
it's starting to seep in.

27:34.487 --> 27:37.154
Dude, it's starting to seep in.
It's so cold.

27:37.890 --> 27:38.822
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

27:38.824 --> 27:41.091
Well, our
duct-tape-and-bubble-pack suit

27:41.093 --> 27:44.428
Seemed to work fine
but then two things happened.

27:44.430 --> 27:47.331
One -- it stopped insulating me.

27:47.333 --> 27:47.998
Aah!

27:48.000 --> 27:49.533
The water started seeping in.

27:49.535 --> 27:50.401
Oh, my god! It's cold!

27:50.403 --> 27:54.104
And second -- my legs went up,
and I was horizontal.

27:54.106 --> 27:56.407
Okay, pull me in.
Pull me in.

27:56.409 --> 27:58.709
I would just be a leaf
floating down this river

27:58.711 --> 28:01.645
At the mercy of every current.

28:01.647 --> 28:03.447
Okay.

28:04.550 --> 28:05.916
This is not the way
to go.

28:05.918 --> 28:08.719
So it's back
to the drawing board --

28:08.721 --> 28:09.286
Literally.

28:09.288 --> 28:11.789
All right, since my
"bubble boy" suit doesn't work,

28:11.791 --> 28:13.157
Clearly we got to
make a boat.

28:13.159 --> 28:15.592
I'm thinking
something like a pontoon

28:15.594 --> 28:17.227
Lashed to another pontoon

28:17.229 --> 28:19.363
With us sitting, like,
in the middle like that.

28:19.365 --> 28:23.167
Well, something tells me
that making a large one of these

28:23.169 --> 28:23.934
Is gonna be problematic,

28:23.936 --> 28:26.470
Because the material itself
isn't very strong.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.505
Maybe we should make
two separate smaller ones.

28:28.507 --> 28:31.942
The smaller we make them, the
more robust they're gonna be.

28:31.944 --> 28:33.177
More redundancy, you know.
Right.

28:33.179 --> 28:35.279
If one of goes down,
the other one's got flotation.

28:35.281 --> 28:38.415
So it's two boats
and two duct-tape designs.

28:38.417 --> 28:41.819
First up, the captains log.

28:41.821 --> 28:43.454
I decided on a log raft design,

28:43.456 --> 28:46.323
Because I know
that I can roll up

28:46.325 --> 28:47.424
This bubble pack real tight

28:47.426 --> 28:50.961
And make these
really safe, reliable logs.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.796
And then all I have to do
is lash them together.

28:52.798 --> 28:55.899
If something happens,
if one of them gets ripped off,

28:55.901 --> 28:56.667
It doesn't really matter,

28:56.669 --> 29:00.671
Because I'll still have
a bunch more to hang onto,

29:00.673 --> 29:01.271
And I'll be safe.

29:01.273 --> 29:03.073
That's the theory.

29:03.075 --> 29:03.974
Don't roll away.

29:03.976 --> 29:06.176
And here's the graphic.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.645
The raft's building blocks
are pontoons

29:08.647 --> 29:11.915
Made from bubble pack
and condensed by tape.

29:11.917 --> 29:12.716
He'll make 10 of those,

29:12.718 --> 29:16.587
Which will then be trussed
together with tape and twine

29:16.589 --> 29:18.021
To create the basic shape.

29:18.023 --> 29:23.227
Finally, he'll add a waterproof
paddle zone and a duct-tape oar.

29:23.229 --> 29:28.065
But will this float his boat
to freedom?

29:28.067 --> 29:29.767
Well, with Captain Hyneman

29:29.769 --> 29:31.435
Getting down
to the nitty-gritty...

29:31.437 --> 29:33.537
This sand is just horrible.

29:33.539 --> 29:36.907
...Let's ship out
with seaman Savage.

29:36.909 --> 29:37.841
Aah!

29:37.843 --> 29:39.510
Yeah,
that's about the right size.

29:39.512 --> 29:45.549
Like Jamie's, Adam's raft also
relies on packaging pontoons.

29:45.551 --> 29:47.518
This is exhausting.

29:47.520 --> 29:50.254
But instead
of 10 short stubbies,

29:50.256 --> 29:52.956
He's turning out
four tall tubes.

29:52.958 --> 29:54.658
Halfway there.

29:54.660 --> 29:59.663
These four lengthy logs will be
stuck together to form his hull.

29:59.665 --> 30:02.266
He'll then insert
a waterproof lining

30:02.268 --> 30:05.702
Complete with padding
from which he'll paddle.

30:05.704 --> 30:07.805
He's hoping
this streamlined shape

30:07.807 --> 30:10.374
Will make it
not just easy to float,

30:10.376 --> 30:13.210
But also easy to steer.

30:13.212 --> 30:14.111
It's like an envelope.

30:14.113 --> 30:18.115
Once Adam's posted his envelope
into the pontoons...

30:18.117 --> 30:20.551
Yeah, that's good.
Good, good, good.

30:20.553 --> 30:22.886
...And sealed it in place...

30:22.888 --> 30:23.453
Awesome.

30:23.455 --> 30:26.156
...It's all set for a dry run.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.859
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

30:28.861 --> 30:30.794
I'm ready for some adventure.

30:30.796 --> 30:33.363
Whew! Whew! Whew! Look out!

30:33.365 --> 30:34.698
Whew-whew-whew-whew!

30:34.700 --> 30:36.967
Sh-sh-sh-sh! Jamie!

30:38.771 --> 30:39.903
Sh-sh! Aah!

30:42.308 --> 30:42.739
Aah!

30:42.741 --> 30:47.678
Meanwhile, at camp Hyneman,
function comes before fun.

30:47.680 --> 30:50.981
What I'm doing is taking
these individual pontoons

30:50.983 --> 30:52.683
And tying them together
in pairs,

30:52.685 --> 30:57.721
And then those pairs into four,
and then two fours into eight,

30:57.723 --> 30:59.990
Which will be the total length
of my craft.

30:59.992 --> 31:03.594
While Jamie may be
all work and no play,

31:03.596 --> 31:07.631
There's no doubt that his build
is less serious streamlining

31:07.633 --> 31:10.133
And more comedy couch.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.005
You've made a couch.

31:15.007 --> 31:15.973
Well, you might as well

31:15.975 --> 31:18.408
Be comfortable on your journey,
huh?

31:18.410 --> 31:19.309
A river couch.

31:23.883 --> 31:25.349
That is hilarious.

31:25.351 --> 31:28.018
I don't think our boats
could be any more different.

31:28.020 --> 31:30.354
I know, and yet, I think
they're both pretty good.

31:30.356 --> 31:32.122
I think they both ought to do
the trick.

31:32.124 --> 31:34.258
I think they both
ought to get us to freedom.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.593
It's true that,
like their owners,

31:36.595 --> 31:38.996
These boats
are chalk and cheese.

31:38.998 --> 31:42.332
The question is,
with the finishing touches done,

31:42.334 --> 31:45.035
Will either of them work?

31:49.942 --> 31:51.608
Adam jumps ship.

31:51.610 --> 31:52.175
Yeah!

31:52.177 --> 31:53.310
Hey, that's not so bad.

31:53.312 --> 31:56.146
But befitting a man
captaining a couch...

31:56.782 --> 32:01.385
...Jamie's launch is
a little more leisurely.

32:02.454 --> 32:04.721
Seems like
it's pretty stable.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.323
I can move around good.

32:06.325 --> 32:07.758
I can turn well.

32:07.760 --> 32:10.894
this is working great.

32:10.896 --> 32:15.365
we haven't
even gotten started yet.

32:15.834 --> 32:20.003
Well, at first blush,
my canoe, my kayak

32:20.005 --> 32:21.772
Seems to be working
just beautifully.

32:21.774 --> 32:23.340
It's nice and stable.

32:23.342 --> 32:26.576
I have a lot of control
over my direction and speed.

32:26.578 --> 32:28.345
I think it's time
to start heading downstream.

32:28.347 --> 32:33.483
But downstream
is where troubled waters await.

32:33.485 --> 32:35.452
I see some currents.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.087
Yep,
we're starting to move.

32:37.089 --> 32:41.358
Uh-oh.
Whoa. Oh, shoot. Whoa!

32:41.360 --> 32:43.860
Adam takes the first rapids...

32:43.862 --> 32:44.328
Yeah!

32:44.330 --> 32:47.030
...Like a duck taped
to water...

32:47.032 --> 32:48.198
Yeah!

32:48.200 --> 32:50.934
...Shortly followed by Jamie.

32:55.841 --> 32:59.609
Whoo!
That works like a charm.

32:59.611 --> 33:01.244
Just like a little cork.

33:01.246 --> 33:04.181
Paradoxically,
the placid patches

33:04.183 --> 33:06.350
Are causing a problem for Jamie.

33:06.352 --> 33:08.919
While this thing is great
for flotation --

33:08.921 --> 33:11.054
It's keeping me
nice and high and dry --

33:11.056 --> 33:16.660
I have crap propulsion,
and these currents keep wanting

33:16.662 --> 33:19.096
To spin you off
to one side or the other,

33:19.098 --> 33:23.300
Which means you just sit there
or you go backwards.

33:23.302 --> 33:24.368
And that's a big problem.

33:24.370 --> 33:28.338
It's tiring
and taking its toll...

33:28.340 --> 33:30.173
I keep getting stuck.

33:30.175 --> 33:32.175
...And could be dangerous.

33:32.177 --> 33:34.044
We don't want to get
too far separated.

33:34.046 --> 33:35.145
If one of us goes under,

33:35.147 --> 33:36.947
The other should be there
for rescue.

33:36.949 --> 33:40.417
But when Jamie suddenly starts
floating more freely,

33:40.419 --> 33:43.587
It's because the current
has picked up.

33:43.589 --> 33:46.289
Oh, Jamie,
look at that.

33:46.491 --> 33:49.292
Yep,
the fun run is done.

33:49.294 --> 33:51.762
This duct-tape trip
is about to get serious.

33:51.764 --> 33:53.730
I don't like
the looks of this.

33:53.732 --> 33:55.198
I don't, either.

33:55.200 --> 33:55.832
What do you think?

33:55.834 --> 33:57.834
Should we take it to the right
or to the left?

33:57.836 --> 33:59.903
I think we go
right down the middle.

33:59.905 --> 34:03.040
okay, here goes nothing.

34:03.042 --> 34:05.042
Oh

34:05.044 --> 34:06.476
Look at this!

34:07.845 --> 34:09.246
Oh!

34:09.248 --> 34:10.313
Whoa!

34:12.350 --> 34:13.949
Whoa!

34:13.952 --> 34:15.918
Whoa!

34:18.589 --> 34:23.060
You're probably pretty surprised
by how nice my tux looks.

34:26.697 --> 34:27.097
Aah!

34:27.099 --> 34:29.498
This thing seems to, like,
resist dust.

34:29.501 --> 34:32.402
I'm rolling around on a beach
in my tux.

34:32.404 --> 34:35.038
That's some james bond stuff
right there.

34:35.040 --> 34:35.806
Look at that.

34:35.808 --> 34:36.773
You know, if anyone saw us,

34:36.775 --> 34:41.311
All we have to say is,
"no one's going to believe you."

34:41.813 --> 34:43.746
Might just be the nerves,
but I could've have sworn

34:43.748 --> 34:45.549
I just saw two rafts
made of duct tape.

34:45.551 --> 34:47.650
You know what's nifty
about these?

34:47.652 --> 34:48.985
There's 100,000 bubbles.

34:48.987 --> 34:51.955
You could shoot this raft
and it'd still keep on going.

34:51.956 --> 34:55.158
That can be arranged.

34:59.230 --> 35:02.466
En route to a vip party,

35:02.468 --> 35:05.335
The Mythbusters were lost
without hope.

35:07.072 --> 35:10.774
But who needs hope
when you've got duct tape...

35:10.776 --> 35:11.942
This is working great!

35:11.944 --> 35:15.412
...And two mad scientists
second to none?

35:15.414 --> 35:17.747
People do this
for recreation?!

35:17.749 --> 35:20.217
Using all of the above,
Adam and Jamie

35:20.219 --> 35:23.120
Have comprehensibly conquered
the canyon.

35:23.122 --> 35:25.822
But can they ride
the raging river?

35:28.127 --> 35:29.926
Oh

35:29.928 --> 35:32.329
Look at this.

35:33.030 --> 35:35.632
Oh! Whoa!

35:36.267 --> 35:38.268
Whoa!

35:38.270 --> 35:41.138
Whoa! Whoo!

35:41.140 --> 35:44.241
Whoa! Yeah!

35:44.243 --> 35:47.410
Yeah! Whoo!

35:51.283 --> 35:52.315
Yes!

35:52.317 --> 35:56.286
Whoo! Yeah!

35:56.288 --> 35:57.287
Whoo!

35:57.289 --> 35:59.823
That was
by far the most severe rapids

35:59.825 --> 36:01.958
We have yet experienced
on this river.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.126
Are you good?!

36:03.128 --> 36:04.161
I'm good!

36:05.230 --> 36:09.332
I hit the speed, went
right over it, skipped across...

36:09.334 --> 36:10.000
Whoa!

36:10.002 --> 36:11.067
...Saw Jamie behind me

36:11.069 --> 36:13.270
Kind of of like flitting
around in his couch.

36:13.272 --> 36:15.805
I felt like
I'm riding a caterpillar.

36:15.807 --> 36:20.110
Like a caterpillar that thinks
it's a jet airplane.

36:20.112 --> 36:21.411
That's what my boat is,

36:21.413 --> 36:24.714
And it rode those rapids
just beautifully.

36:24.716 --> 36:25.282
Whoo!

36:25.284 --> 36:27.083
And that's
pretty much what happens

36:27.085 --> 36:30.420
For the next six hours --
moments of serenity...

36:30.422 --> 36:33.390
It's so beautiful. This is
better than taking a train.

36:33.392 --> 36:35.192
Still no sign of Wallenda.

36:35.194 --> 36:38.228
...Then moments to repent.

36:39.131 --> 36:42.365
All of a sudden, you see
a little kind of narrow spot,

36:42.367 --> 36:48.238
And you hear the sound,
and it's really nerve-racking,

36:48.240 --> 36:50.807
'cause we don't know
what's on the other side of it.

36:50.809 --> 36:52.676
Whoa!

36:52.678 --> 36:55.078
Yep, as the landscape shifts,

36:55.080 --> 36:58.315
The ultimate test
for their well-crafted rafts

36:58.317 --> 37:01.451
Is getting ready to rumble.

37:01.919 --> 37:05.889
As you can see, we have paddled
long enough to leave the canyon.

37:05.891 --> 37:08.792
Boy,
the scenery has changed.

37:08.794 --> 37:10.293
Yeah, it's like
a whole different river.

37:10.295 --> 37:13.430
Gone are the red rocks,
gone are the high cliffs,

37:13.432 --> 37:15.832
And now we must be close
to civilization,

37:15.834 --> 37:17.334
But we're
not out of the woods yet,

37:17.336 --> 37:21.438
For, as they say, "It's
always darkest before the dawn."

37:22.506 --> 37:27.177
And surely it doesn't
get any darker than this.

37:27.179 --> 37:29.145
Ah

37:29.147 --> 37:32.315
A roaring,
raging, grade-five rapid.

37:32.317 --> 37:34.851
Adam grits his teeth...

37:34.853 --> 37:36.453
Duck!

37:36.455 --> 37:37.320
Aah!

37:37.322 --> 37:39.923
...And carefully takes aim.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.424
Oh-oh-oh!

37:41.426 --> 37:43.827
But will it be sink or swim?

37:43.829 --> 37:45.328
Whoa!

37:46.464 --> 37:47.931
Whoa!

37:52.570 --> 37:53.103
Adam!

37:53.105 --> 37:59.009
For a full
five seconds, Adam's down.

38:00.177 --> 38:02.379
But then he's up.

38:02.381 --> 38:03.146
Jamie!

38:03.148 --> 38:05.448
Although,
he's not out of danger yet.

38:05.450 --> 38:05.782
Aah!

38:05.784 --> 38:09.519
The rocky rapids unleash
their full-on force-five,

38:09.521 --> 38:11.821
And Adam is swept away.

38:11.823 --> 38:12.789
Oh!

38:12.791 --> 38:19.329
But thanks to luck, judgment,
and fabricated floatation,

38:19.331 --> 38:22.365
He makes it to the other side.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.703
Whew!

38:27.806 --> 38:30.206
Whew! That was close.

38:30.208 --> 38:31.207
I hit the rapids.

38:31.209 --> 38:33.843
It felt like
I hit them just right.

38:33.845 --> 38:37.914
And then, all of a sudden,
it all went just wrong.

38:37.916 --> 38:38.915
My boat curled away.

38:38.917 --> 38:42.385
It felt like it bent like
something that bends.

38:42.387 --> 38:46.122
and then I was in the water.

38:46.124 --> 38:48.825
And I don't know
what exactly happened...

38:48.827 --> 38:49.492
Jamie!

38:49.494 --> 38:51.027
...But I felt like I caught air.

38:51.029 --> 38:52.228
Aah!

38:52.731 --> 38:56.833
At least I still have all of
my fingers and toes and my boat.

38:56.835 --> 38:59.936
All I got to do
is wait for Jamie.

38:59.938 --> 39:04.240
Jamie's raft,
built for stability and comfort

39:04.242 --> 39:05.408
Is less streamlined,

39:05.410 --> 39:09.012
So how will he survive
the raging torrent?

39:12.049 --> 39:15.652
Well,
our hirsute hero gets stuck,

39:15.654 --> 39:17.687
Climbs out,

39:17.689 --> 39:21.925
And chooses
a much calmer course.

39:25.197 --> 39:28.164
Well, it was
a little unconventional, but...

39:28.166 --> 39:29.132
Yeah!

39:29.134 --> 39:30.800
...Better than going for a swim.

39:30.802 --> 39:33.737
I mean, you could get hurt
in those rapids.

39:33.739 --> 39:34.270
Hyah!

39:34.272 --> 39:36.606
With freedom
surely not far away,

39:36.608 --> 39:38.508
It's onwards and downwards.

39:38.510 --> 39:41.244
So we're going down
the river and we hear a roar.

39:41.246 --> 39:43.246
Jamie?
What?

39:43.248 --> 39:44.614
I don't like
the sound of that.

39:44.616 --> 39:47.016
We figure,
"that sounds different.

39:47.018 --> 39:49.619
Let's investigate
before going through."

39:49.621 --> 39:53.223
Ah.

39:53.225 --> 39:54.591
Well,
there's your problem.

39:54.593 --> 39:57.694
And it is a good thing,
too,

39:57.696 --> 40:02.365
Because this rinse-and-spin
cycle would've eaten us alive.

40:02.367 --> 40:04.401
Going through this
is a "no go."

40:04.403 --> 40:05.001
We got to go around.

40:05.003 --> 40:07.036
So it looks like
the only choice we have

40:07.038 --> 40:13.543
Is to bypass this rapid and use
the rope that we have left over

40:13.545 --> 40:16.679
To lower the boats
down off of the cliff,

40:16.681 --> 40:18.381
And then go down after them.

40:18.383 --> 40:20.016
So it's time
for one last

40:20.018 --> 40:23.386
"Livin' on a prayer"
cliffhanger.

40:23.854 --> 40:26.956
what could possibly go wrong?

40:26.958 --> 40:28.191
Only this time,

40:28.193 --> 40:32.662
The cliff they're hanging off
is "slippery when wet."

40:32.664 --> 40:34.831
A little slack.

40:34.899 --> 40:38.968
Aw, crap.
The transition always sucks.

40:38.970 --> 40:39.602
Okay, here we go.

40:39.604 --> 40:42.305
Using the method
they mastered in the canyon,

40:42.307 --> 40:47.076
Adam makes
the sheer 25-foot drop.

40:54.219 --> 40:56.319
Whew! I'm good!

40:57.121 --> 41:00.890
Next,
Jamie casts down the canoe.

41:00.892 --> 41:02.292
Whoa! Whoa!

41:02.294 --> 41:06.729
Love it! Look at that!
It's totally working!

41:07.231 --> 41:08.398
Then comes the couch...

41:08.400 --> 41:09.933
Here comes mine!

41:09.935 --> 41:13.369
...Which also bounces down
buoyantly.

41:13.371 --> 41:14.404
Ho!

41:14.406 --> 41:18.441
That just leaves
"scared of heights" Hyneman.

41:18.443 --> 41:20.844
Oh

41:22.079 --> 41:25.482
But when his descent
is also disaster-free,

41:25.484 --> 41:29.752
It's clear that in this
duct-tape survival special..

41:30.255 --> 41:32.188
...The Mythbusters
have conquered

41:32.190 --> 41:33.490
Not just their surroundings...

41:33.492 --> 41:36.459
That's it.
...But also their fears.

41:36.461 --> 41:37.694
That's not so bad.

41:37.696 --> 41:39.229
Not so bad at all.
Well done.

41:39.231 --> 41:43.032
And as they float
their boats one last time...

41:43.034 --> 41:44.501
yeah!

41:44.503 --> 41:47.704
...There's more than
light at the end of this tunnel.

41:47.706 --> 41:49.405
Do you hear that?

41:49.407 --> 41:50.473
What?
That.

41:50.475 --> 41:54.611
Ah!
It sounds like civilization!

41:54.613 --> 41:56.946
If we hurry up,
we might just make it.

41:56.948 --> 42:00.850
With their vip party
just a paddle away,

42:00.852 --> 42:02.986
Adam takes time to take stock.

42:02.988 --> 42:05.388
I have to say,
this might go down in history

42:05.390 --> 42:07.323
As one of the best adventures
we've had.

42:07.325 --> 42:10.260
Starting out with our car
running out of gas...

42:12.464 --> 42:15.398
Using its battery
to start a fire...

42:15.599 --> 42:19.969
...Making some duct-tape tents
to survive in the desert,

42:19.971 --> 42:24.574
Using duct tape to rappel
to the bottom of the canyon...

42:26.811 --> 42:29.913
...Which we then had to make
some boats

42:29.915 --> 42:32.916
To go down the canyon river...

42:32.918 --> 42:34.951
Whoa! Whoo!

42:34.953 --> 42:37.053
Yeah! Yeah!

42:37.055 --> 42:39.255
Whoa!

42:39.257 --> 42:41.190
Aah!

42:42.427 --> 42:46.496
...It has been
one heck of an adventure.

42:47.698 --> 42:51.467
An adventure that,
in a hotel far, far away,

42:51.469 --> 42:55.138
Comes
to a star-laden party finale.

42:57.409 --> 42:58.207
Well, we made it.

42:58.209 --> 43:00.743
This is it.
Shall we do it?

43:00.745 --> 43:01.844
Yeah, hold on.

43:01.846 --> 43:02.912
All right.

43:02.914 --> 43:04.781
I think you look
as good as can be.

43:04.783 --> 43:05.915
All right.
Wait, hold on.

43:05.917 --> 43:08.785
This is a good entrance.
Three, two, one.

43:10.755 --> 43:12.055
Or not.

43:13.858 --> 43:15.458
We missed the party.

43:15.693 --> 43:19.228
Oh, we still have time
to make the walk if we hurry.

43:19.230 --> 43:21.664
All we need
is a little more duct tape.

43:22.834 --> 43:25.935
Seriously? A wink is
how you're gonna finish this?

43:25.937 --> 43:27.971
All right.

43:28.305 --> 43:34.557
