WEBVTT

00:04.773 --> 00:09.940
Wow. Austin and Brooke's date
is sure taking a long time.

00:09.941 --> 00:12.204
Oh! Here they come. Act like
we're not watching them.

00:12.205 --> 00:14.545
We're not.

00:14.680 --> 00:16.827
Austin, I had a
lot of fun today.

00:16.828 --> 00:20.507
I made this scrapbook
of our time together.

00:20.508 --> 00:26.070
Here's a napkin from our first date, a
mini-golf scorecard from our second date.

00:26.071 --> 00:30.991
And a crouton from the
salad we just finished.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.504
Want to hang out Friday?

00:33.505 --> 00:37.408
Uh... I was supposed to hang
out with Dez, but sure.

00:37.409 --> 00:39.209
Aw.

00:40.201 --> 00:42.403
Hey guys.

00:42.404 --> 00:44.922
Okay, enough boring love stuff.

00:44.923 --> 00:46.511
I've got some big news.

00:46.512 --> 00:49.952
Austin, what's something you've asked
for since I became your manager?

00:49.953 --> 00:51.578
To play Times Square
on New Year's Eve?

00:51.579 --> 00:54.114
Close. I'm gonna get you on
the cover of "Cheetah Beat!"

00:54.115 --> 00:55.909
Whoa! That's huge.

00:55.910 --> 00:57.146
What up!

00:57.147 --> 01:00.715
They have this hot new celeb issue
where they profile a rising star.

01:00.716 --> 01:03.123
Every hot new celeb
becomes a superstar.

01:03.124 --> 01:05.090
Beyonce, Adele, Ryan Gosling...

01:05.092 --> 01:07.208
Do you remember Jim Futch?

01:07.209 --> 01:09.396
- No, who's he?
- Exactly.

01:09.397 --> 01:13.367
You don't remember him because
he wasn't a hot new celeb.

01:13.368 --> 01:16.886
If you fill out this questionnaire,
I know I can get them to pick you.

01:16.887 --> 01:18.867
Sweet!

01:19.341 --> 01:21.261
Name?

01:21.564 --> 01:26.279
Easy. It's gonna take a lot more
than that to stump Austin Moon.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.855
Oops. Too many O's.

01:28.856 --> 01:32.118
It's not a quiz. They want to
know what your life is like.

01:32.119 --> 01:33.387
Oh.

01:33.388 --> 01:36.122
Well, I like playing music,
hanging with my friends...

01:36.123 --> 01:37.391
Boring!

01:37.392 --> 01:40.108
It has to sound
unique and exciting.

01:40.109 --> 01:43.901
Look. Emma Stone races cars
through the streets of Romania!

01:43.902 --> 01:46.634
Jack Black teaches sign
language to grizzly bears!

01:46.635 --> 01:49.361
Well, Austin Moon
collects grizzly bears.

01:49.362 --> 01:52.138
It's teddy bears.

01:52.139 --> 01:53.724
I'll just fill this out for you.

01:53.725 --> 01:56.209
I'm used to making myself
seem more impressive.

01:56.210 --> 01:58.442
How do you think I got
my job as a lifeguard?

01:58.443 --> 02:01.383
I can't even swim.

02:04.974 --> 02:08.076
<i>When the crowd wants more,
I bring on the thunder.</i>

02:08.077 --> 02:11.211
<i>'Cause you've got my back,
and I'm not going under.</i>

02:11.212 --> 02:12.743
<i>You're my point,
you're my guard.</i>

02:12.744 --> 02:14.362
<i>You're the perfect chord.</i>

02:14.363 --> 02:17.407
<i>And I see our names together
on every billboard.</i>

02:17.408 --> 02:20.466
<i>We're headed for the top,
we've got it on lock.</i>

02:20.467 --> 02:22.080
<i>We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

02:22.081 --> 02:24.403
<i>And we'll keep rockin'.</i>

02:24.404 --> 02:28.541
<i>Oh, there's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

02:28.542 --> 02:31.577
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

02:31.578 --> 02:34.647
<i>It's no fun when
you're doing it solo.</i>

02:34.648 --> 02:37.970
<i>With you it's like, "whoa".
Yeah, and I know.</i>

02:37.971 --> 02:40.620
<i>I own this dream.</i>

02:40.621 --> 02:43.998
<i>'Cause I got you with me.</i>

02:43.999 --> 02:47.116
<i>There's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

02:47.117 --> 02:51.437
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

02:56.817 --> 02:58.808
<i>Ally helps a customer.</i>

02:58.809 --> 03:01.510
<i>Always gives correct change.</i>

03:01.511 --> 03:03.992
<i>Puts the headphones in the bag.</i>

03:03.993 --> 03:05.782
<i>And says "have a nice day".</i>

03:05.783 --> 03:09.623
<i>She's got the Sonic Boom blues.</i>

03:12.355 --> 03:14.556
You're really bored aren't you?

03:14.557 --> 03:17.257
Yep. Little bit.

03:17.494 --> 03:20.444
Austin, I've been on the phone
all morning with "Cheetah Beat."

03:20.445 --> 03:22.912
They're sending over their top
reporter to interview you.

03:22.913 --> 03:24.500
- Whoa!
- Awesome!

03:24.501 --> 03:26.727
They must have loved that
questionnaire you filled out for me.

03:26.728 --> 03:29.891
Oh, and if she asks you're a 10th
degree black belt in Kung Fu,

03:29.892 --> 03:31.384
you swim with sharks,
race motorcycles,

03:31.385 --> 03:35.377
and a bunch of other crazy
stuff I can't remember.

03:35.378 --> 03:37.130
You shouldn't have lied.

03:37.131 --> 03:40.256
Being cool isn't about doing
crazy exciting things.

03:40.257 --> 03:43.686
It's those special qualities you
have deep down that make you cool.

03:43.687 --> 03:49.181
Yeah, that sounds like something
an uncool person would say.

03:49.182 --> 03:52.397
All you have to do to get the
cover is impress Megan Simms.

03:52.398 --> 03:55.401
She's the most powerful
reporter in the biz.

03:55.402 --> 03:56.686
Omg!

03:56.687 --> 04:00.025
Austin Moon. It's really you.

04:00.026 --> 04:02.919
Not now, kid. We're waiting for
a reporter from "Cheetah Beat."

04:02.920 --> 04:05.800
I am the reporter.

04:06.254 --> 04:08.654
Megan Simms.

04:08.745 --> 04:10.015
But you're like, five.

04:10.016 --> 04:13.842
I'm 10. And I don't usually
get starstruck, but I am...

04:13.843 --> 04:16.003
<i>Freaking!</i>

04:16.415 --> 04:19.755
And I'm having
trouble breathing.

04:19.755 --> 04:21.457
Oh, you must be Ally.

04:21.458 --> 04:23.387
- Oh!
- Austin's songwriter.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.536
You are like the
most epic girl...

04:25.537 --> 04:27.457
<i>Ever.</i>

04:28.122 --> 04:30.536
Thank you, Megan.

04:30.537 --> 04:32.163
You guys hear that?

04:32.164 --> 04:34.072
Most epic girl...

04:34.073 --> 04:35.993
<i>Ever.</i>

04:40.352 --> 04:42.120
So let's get the
interview started.

04:42.121 --> 04:43.470
There's no interview.

04:43.471 --> 04:46.239
I'm here to see Austin do all
the fun stuff he wrote about.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.785
What?!

04:47.786 --> 04:50.841
You want the cover, don't you?

04:50.842 --> 04:52.949
I'm young, but I'm powerful.

04:52.950 --> 04:58.470
Now if you'll excuse me, I
have to go make a tinkle.

04:59.189 --> 05:02.024
I can't believe I have to do all
that stuff you just made up.

05:02.025 --> 05:03.680
Like being a Kung Fu expert.

05:03.681 --> 05:07.500
Well, it's not like I said you can
break boards with your bare hands.

05:07.501 --> 05:09.899
Oh wait. I did.

05:09.900 --> 05:14.003
Austin, the secret is to visualize
your hand going through the board.

05:14.004 --> 05:15.685
It's a piece of cake.

05:15.686 --> 05:17.777
Hi-yah!

05:17.778 --> 05:19.638
Aah!

05:20.095 --> 05:22.199
Why did you say I know Kung Fu?

05:22.200 --> 05:25.648
Because I don't know
how to spell Jujitsu.

05:25.649 --> 05:29.366
Besides, I didn't think you'd
actually have to do all this stuff.

05:29.367 --> 05:30.980
Just tell Megan the truth.

05:30.981 --> 05:33.022
You don't have to lie to be on
the cover of "Cheetah Beat."

05:33.023 --> 05:34.640
Just be yourself.

05:34.641 --> 05:37.026
This isn't just about
the cover anymore.

05:37.027 --> 05:39.803
If Austin doesn't go through
with all this crazy stuff,

05:39.804 --> 05:42.222
Megan will expose him
for being a huge liar.

05:42.223 --> 05:43.556
That could ruin my career.

05:43.557 --> 05:48.072
Not to mention your reputation
in the Kung Fu circuit.

05:48.073 --> 05:52.912
I so cannot believe Austin Moon is
gonna break wood with his bare hands.

05:52.913 --> 05:55.553
Neither can he.

05:56.897 --> 05:58.997
Megan...

05:59.439 --> 06:03.123
We're not really supposed to use
martial arts unless we're attacked.

06:03.124 --> 06:05.411
And this wood
hasn't attacked me.

06:05.412 --> 06:08.631
So I'm not gonna fight it.

06:08.632 --> 06:09.930
You're totes hilar.

06:09.931 --> 06:13.231
But for reals, break it!

06:15.422 --> 06:17.257
Hi-yah!

06:17.258 --> 06:19.118
Woo!

06:19.359 --> 06:21.819
Ha ha! Whoa!

06:22.005 --> 06:23.562
I mean...

06:23.563 --> 06:25.298
I meant to do that.

06:25.299 --> 06:29.602
That was awesome! Now try
breaking a cinder block.

06:29.603 --> 06:33.472
I'm sure Austin would, but
too bad we don't have any.

06:33.473 --> 06:36.953
Cinder block coming through.

06:37.839 --> 06:39.610
Uh...

06:39.611 --> 06:43.044
I've already shown Megan
that I clearly know Kung Fu.

06:43.045 --> 06:45.880
Wouldn't want to show off.

06:45.881 --> 06:47.915
Do it.

06:47.916 --> 06:49.956
Do it!

06:50.324 --> 06:52.483
Yeah. Do it.

06:52.484 --> 06:54.524
Do it.

06:58.532 --> 07:00.632
Hi-yah!

07:01.501 --> 07:03.541
Austin:

07:03.630 --> 07:05.045
I don't know what happened.

07:05.046 --> 07:09.246
Usually I can break
those no problem.

07:10.477 --> 07:12.411
Aw, did you hurt your hand?

07:12.412 --> 07:15.514
If only there was a way you could
have avoided punching concrete.

07:15.515 --> 07:20.135
Oh wait, there was.
It's called not lying.

07:20.587 --> 07:22.421
There's a cool motorcycle.

07:22.422 --> 07:24.224
Where do you keep
your motorcycles?

07:24.225 --> 07:28.461
A pic of you on your bike
would be great for the cover.

07:28.462 --> 07:30.396
That is his motorcycle.

07:30.397 --> 07:31.497
Right.

07:31.498 --> 07:32.975
Yeah.

07:32.976 --> 07:34.991
- It's one of his favorites.
- I mean, it's right here.

07:34.992 --> 07:37.647
- It's so convenient.
- Very nice bike.

07:37.648 --> 07:39.471
You look so cool on that bike.

07:39.472 --> 07:43.672
That's cool with a
"K." even cooler!

07:45.554 --> 07:48.314
Uh, Austin? A scary biker.

07:48.315 --> 07:50.955
Ooh, good idea.

07:51.185 --> 07:53.852
Okay, Megan. We're
done taking pictures.

07:53.853 --> 07:56.133
Nice bike.

07:59.360 --> 08:02.328
Austin! That lady's
stealing your motorcycle.

08:02.329 --> 08:05.869
Oh, no! Do something Austin.

08:07.334 --> 08:10.034
Stop, you thief?

08:10.470 --> 08:11.926
Call the police.

08:11.927 --> 08:13.710
Right. I got this.

08:13.711 --> 08:16.309
We should definitely
call the police.

08:16.310 --> 08:18.233
Beep boop boop.

08:18.234 --> 08:20.716
Hello, police?

08:20.717 --> 08:23.117
Bye, police.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.452
I can't believe you
actually called the police.

08:26.453 --> 08:29.330
It's the least I can do.

08:29.331 --> 08:33.592
I know how much your pretend
motorcycle meant to you.

08:33.592 --> 08:38.197
You've already Kung Fu'd, called the
cops, and it's not even lunchtime!

08:38.198 --> 08:43.501
Speaking of, now I get to see
you eat your special lunch.

08:43.503 --> 08:44.667
My special lunch?

08:44.668 --> 08:47.819
Yeah. You remember what you
wrote on the questionnaire.

08:47.820 --> 08:50.404
You're on a high
protein insect diet.

08:50.405 --> 08:53.056
- What?!
- Don't blame me. It was Dez's idea.

08:53.057 --> 08:55.697
I eat insects?!

08:57.830 --> 08:59.036
I mean...

08:59.037 --> 09:01.977
I eat insects. Mmm.

09:02.249 --> 09:04.160
Too bad I left my lunch
at home and don't have...

09:04.161 --> 09:06.575
Insects coming through!

09:06.576 --> 09:10.509
Crickets, low in fat,
high in antennae.

09:10.510 --> 09:13.455
I can't believe you
really eat bugs.

09:13.456 --> 09:15.159
That's so disgust.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.881
It's not so bad. Dez
put them in spaghetti.

09:17.882 --> 09:20.582
Those are worms.

09:26.583 --> 09:28.727
You know, I'm really not
that hungry right now.

09:28.728 --> 09:30.828
Eat it!

09:32.000 --> 09:38.074

09:41.808 --> 09:43.668
Ewe.

09:43.810 --> 09:45.844
That was awesome!

09:45.845 --> 09:48.181
You are totes a hot new celeb.

09:48.182 --> 09:51.421
I'm gonna go call my editor.

09:51.422 --> 09:54.148
You hear that, Austin?
You're a hot new celeb!

09:54.149 --> 09:55.589
Fingers crossed for the cover.

09:55.590 --> 09:59.853
By the way, are you gonna
eat the rest of these?

09:59.854 --> 10:03.498
I'm just glad she's leaving. I
can't do any more of this stuff.

10:03.499 --> 10:07.399
Guys, my editor wants me to see
you do more of this stuff.

10:07.400 --> 10:10.166
I'm staying the whole weekend!

10:10.167 --> 10:12.987
The whole weekend?

10:13.476 --> 10:16.476
That is totes hilar.

10:30.957 --> 10:34.077
Sleepovers are so fun!

10:34.453 --> 10:37.333
Yeah! So much fun.

10:39.198 --> 10:41.351
Oh, look, Austin. Twinsies.

10:41.352 --> 10:43.512
What up?

10:44.303 --> 10:47.005
I brought stuffed animals.
Who wants what?

10:47.006 --> 10:49.834
Aw, that's sweet, Megan.
But we've all outgrown...

10:49.835 --> 10:51.500
Dibs on the purple porcupine.

10:51.501 --> 10:56.147
- You want to help me finish my fort?
- Do I?!

10:56.148 --> 10:59.763
This is a nightmare. We wouldn't even
be in this mess if it wasn't for you.

10:59.764 --> 11:01.582
If you want to get on the
cover of "Cheetah Beat",

11:01.583 --> 11:03.451
you gotta suck it
up for the weekend.

11:03.452 --> 11:06.238
Besides, it's not like you had
anything else better to do.

11:06.239 --> 11:08.274
I was gonna go on a date
with Brooke tonight.

11:08.275 --> 11:10.338
Scrapbook girl?

11:10.339 --> 11:14.291
Like I said, it's not like you
had anything else better to do.

11:14.292 --> 11:17.168
Ally? You know what the
best part of tonight is?

11:17.169 --> 11:19.246
Getting to hang out with you.

11:19.247 --> 11:21.496
- Really?
- Really?

11:21.497 --> 11:23.537
Really?

11:24.944 --> 11:29.014
My friends and I think it is so epic
that you write all of Austin's songs.

11:29.015 --> 11:32.451
You're like so smart, and
pretty, and talented.

11:32.452 --> 11:35.572
Aw. That is so sweet.

11:36.431 --> 11:37.956
I'm just being myself.

11:37.957 --> 11:40.717
Completely honest.

11:42.351 --> 11:45.821
Well, it's getting pretty late.
Maybe we should all go to sleep.

11:45.822 --> 11:47.132
Go to sleep?

11:47.133 --> 11:52.237
In the questionnaire, Austin said
you stay up all night jamming.

11:52.238 --> 11:57.274
Huh. I wonder why I would write that
since everyone knows how cranky I get

11:57.275 --> 11:59.975
when I'm tired.

12:00.046 --> 12:03.114
All right. Okay.
I'll play one song.

12:03.115 --> 12:04.590
Yay!

12:04.591 --> 12:06.167
- Just one.
- Mm-hmm.

12:06.168 --> 12:09.408
<i>I'm a little butterfly.</i>

12:09.989 --> 12:13.289
<i>Spread my colorful wings.</i>

12:14.346 --> 12:18.246
<i>Even though I'm small and frail.</i>

12:18.254 --> 12:21.494
<i>I can do most anything.</i>

12:23.035 --> 12:25.255
<i>Butterfly.</i>

12:26.205 --> 12:27.622
Play it again!

12:27.623 --> 12:29.563
Oh! Not again!

12:29.564 --> 12:31.545
That was the 100th time.

12:31.546 --> 12:33.904
It's morning now.
Aren't you tired?

12:33.905 --> 12:37.400
Why did you even bring a sleeping
bag if you weren't gonna sleep?

12:37.401 --> 12:39.981
I know, right?

12:49.261 --> 12:51.062
I just had the worst nightmare.

12:51.063 --> 12:55.524
We were hanging out with this 10-year-old
girl and she just wouldn't leave us alone.

12:55.525 --> 12:58.465
Good morning, Angel.

12:58.971 --> 13:01.015
Sorry for canceling last night.

13:01.016 --> 13:03.606
I'd hang out tonight,
but I gotta work again.

13:03.607 --> 13:06.591
You're not just blowing me off to
do something more fun, are you?

13:06.592 --> 13:08.331
I've been up all night.

13:08.332 --> 13:10.571
I had to floss crickets
out of my teeth!

13:10.572 --> 13:13.843
Trust me. I'm not
having any fun.

13:13.844 --> 13:16.227
I'll text you later.

13:16.228 --> 13:18.493
Last night was the best!

13:18.494 --> 13:20.511
I can't wait for
tonight's party.

13:20.512 --> 13:21.926
- Party?
- Huh?

13:21.927 --> 13:23.907
Right.

13:24.107 --> 13:27.479
Every Saturday Austin throws
an awesome theme party.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.659
What's tonight's theme?

13:29.660 --> 13:31.200
Uh...

13:31.201 --> 13:33.001
Uh.

13:33.069 --> 13:36.969
Tonight's theme is...
uh... uh...

13:37.449 --> 13:39.187
Glow in the dark!

13:39.188 --> 13:41.200
Totes fantast!

13:41.201 --> 13:43.621
Have fun putting that
together, Trish.

13:43.622 --> 13:46.084
Megan and I are gonna...

13:46.085 --> 13:49.160
Go extreme paint balling!
I like the sound of that.

13:49.161 --> 13:51.575
I like the sound of that too.
Paint balling.

13:51.576 --> 13:54.407
P-p-p-p-paint-ball-ing.

13:54.408 --> 13:56.994
I'm supposed to pull
this off all my myself?

13:56.995 --> 13:59.647
- Get Ally to help you.
- Oh.

13:59.648 --> 14:00.997
Where is she anyway?

14:00.998 --> 14:06.898
She went to go throw her trash away
like 20 minutes ago and fell asleep.

14:19.049 --> 14:20.524
Hi, Ally.

14:20.525 --> 14:22.107
Hey, everybody.

14:22.108 --> 14:24.032
How was extreme paintball?

14:24.033 --> 14:25.566
Extremely painful.

14:25.567 --> 14:28.618
Especially when you're playing
with a 10-year-old sharpshooter.

14:28.619 --> 14:34.079
I never saw her coming. It's
like she was everywhere.

14:36.527 --> 14:40.697
Hey, here comes Austin's new
European supermodel girlfriend.

14:40.698 --> 14:41.844
Enjoying the party?

14:41.845 --> 14:45.145
Austin Moon my boyfriend.

14:47.096 --> 14:49.259
I had to hire her because
I told "Cheetah Beat",

14:49.260 --> 14:51.407
you were dating a
European supermodel.

14:51.408 --> 14:56.868
How many things did you make
up in that questionnaire?

14:58.127 --> 15:00.550
Not that I'm complaining.

15:00.551 --> 15:02.662
Hi, I'm Megan. What's your name?

15:02.663 --> 15:05.064
Austin Moon my boyfriend.

15:05.065 --> 15:10.694
You don't understand a word
any of us are saying, do you?

15:10.695 --> 15:13.995
Austin Moon my boyfriend.

15:16.822 --> 15:18.906
Austin Moon my boyfriend.

15:18.907 --> 15:22.217
That's European model.
My girlfriend.

15:22.218 --> 15:25.518
Time to play some music.

15:28.213 --> 15:30.483
<i>Oh oh oh oh oh.</i>

15:30.484 --> 15:32.649
<i>Oh oh oh oh oh.</i>

15:32.650 --> 15:34.718
<i>Oh oh oh oh oh.</i>

15:34.719 --> 15:36.999
<i>Oh oh oh.</i>

15:37.000 --> 15:41.491
<i>Maybe I shouldn't have lied.
I was in over my head.</i>

15:41.492 --> 15:45.919
<i>All the games that I played.
Just played me instead.</i>

15:45.920 --> 15:47.501
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

15:47.502 --> 15:49.751
<i>I'm trying to forget.</i>

15:49.752 --> 15:54.389
<i>I was too busy fronting.
How dumb can I get?</i>

15:54.390 --> 15:56.543
<i>Oh oh oh. So busted.</i>

15:56.544 --> 15:58.575
<i>Oh oh oh. I messed it.</i>

15:58.576 --> 15:59.932
<i>Up up up.</i>

15:59.933 --> 16:02.477
<i>Gonna tell you what what what.</i>

16:02.478 --> 16:04.896
<i>I'm gonna dance like a
freak on the pier tonight.</i>

16:04.897 --> 16:06.951
<i>Sing the wrong words
into the mic.</i>

16:06.952 --> 16:09.352
<i>'Cause that's just who I am.</i>

16:09.353 --> 16:11.432
<i>That's just who I am.</i>

16:11.433 --> 16:13.590
<i>I won't care if
they laugh at me.</i>

16:13.591 --> 16:15.697
<i>If I lose my grip on gravity.</i>

16:15.698 --> 16:17.866
<i>I'm doing the best I can.</i>

16:17.867 --> 16:23.147
<i>'Cause that's just who I...
that's just who I am.</i>

16:28.750 --> 16:30.758
Austin!

16:30.759 --> 16:32.386
That's awkward.

16:32.387 --> 16:35.057
I thought you weren't blowing
me off to do fun stuff.

16:35.058 --> 16:36.340
Brooke...

16:36.341 --> 16:38.175
This isn't what it looks like.

16:38.176 --> 16:42.603
It's not a really awesome party
that you didn't invite me to?

16:42.604 --> 16:45.383
Okay, it's exactly what it looks
like, but I can explain everything.

16:45.384 --> 16:48.520
Austin Moon my boyfriend.

16:48.521 --> 16:51.221
Except for that.

16:56.361 --> 16:59.531
- Go go go go!
- Hurry up!

16:59.532 --> 17:01.830
Where'd you guys go?

17:01.831 --> 17:04.717
We just got up early. Didn't
want to miss saying good-bye.

17:04.718 --> 17:06.578
So, good-bye.

17:06.579 --> 17:09.459
We packed for you.

17:11.343 --> 17:13.242
This has been the
best weekend...

17:13.243 --> 17:14.747
<i>Ever.</i>

17:14.748 --> 17:17.497
Austin, you are totes
making the cover.

17:17.498 --> 17:18.645
- We did it?
- Yes!

17:18.646 --> 17:22.252
- Woo-hoo!
- Lying's still bad.

17:22.253 --> 17:25.089
I'm gonna give you a shout-out
in the article too, Ally.

17:25.089 --> 17:27.459
You are such an
amaze song writer.

17:27.460 --> 17:29.552
How'd you come up
with that new song?

17:29.553 --> 17:31.295
Like I do all my songs.

17:31.296 --> 17:35.861
Austin and I sit at the piano, toss around
some ideas, and see what sounds good.

17:35.862 --> 17:37.567
Oh. That's it?

17:37.568 --> 17:40.370
I thought it would
be more interesting.

17:40.371 --> 17:42.568
Well, bye.

17:42.569 --> 17:43.706
- Bye.
- See you.

17:43.707 --> 17:46.243
Miss you already.

17:46.244 --> 17:48.513
Megan, wait!

17:48.514 --> 17:51.078
What do you mean
more interesting?

17:51.079 --> 17:53.317
Just that you write
all those epic songs.

17:53.318 --> 17:56.701
I thought maybe you did exciting
things to get inspired.

17:56.702 --> 17:59.835
Oh. We do exciting things.

17:59.836 --> 18:02.293
Ally, what are you doing?

18:02.294 --> 18:04.491
What kind of exciting things?

18:04.492 --> 18:07.006
Oh, you know. Like...

18:07.007 --> 18:10.699
Go to the top of the highest bridge
in Miami and look at the city lights.

18:10.700 --> 18:12.098
And?

18:12.099 --> 18:13.404
And...

18:13.405 --> 18:16.783
Then we bungee jump
off the bridge.

18:16.784 --> 18:20.135
Awesome! That's the picture
I want for the cover.

18:20.136 --> 18:22.213
Why don't you all go
bungee jumping today?

18:22.214 --> 18:24.081
Oh, I don't know.

18:24.082 --> 18:26.122
Do it!

18:28.645 --> 18:31.051
Ally, why did you say that?
We were so close.

18:31.052 --> 18:32.932
She was out the door.

18:32.933 --> 18:35.092
I'm sorry. I panicked.

18:35.093 --> 18:37.102
I didn't want to let her down.

18:37.103 --> 18:41.754
Well, now we're all going down a giant
bridge with a rope tied around us.

18:41.755 --> 18:44.215
Thanks, Ally.

18:50.468 --> 18:53.270
I can't believe we're going
bungee jumping today.

18:53.271 --> 18:56.273
You know, a wise
woman once said,

18:56.274 --> 18:59.376
"being cool isn't about doing
crazy exciting things.

18:59.377 --> 19:00.970
It's those special qualities..."

19:00.971 --> 19:03.313
I know what I said.

19:03.314 --> 19:06.050
Then why'd you even say bungee
jumping in the first place?

19:06.051 --> 19:09.529
Because. Megan and her
friends all look up to me.

19:09.530 --> 19:11.154
And I didn't want
to disappoint them.

19:11.155 --> 19:14.815
And I love the word "bungee."

19:16.427 --> 19:18.578
We don't have to go
through with this.

19:18.579 --> 19:21.839
I'll call Megan and tell her
we aren't gonna bungee jump.

19:21.840 --> 19:25.302
Rather lose the cover
than see you so scared.

19:25.303 --> 19:28.619
You'd give up your first
national magazine cover for me?

19:28.620 --> 19:31.452
You're more important
to me than all of that.

19:31.453 --> 19:34.244
That's really sweet, Austin.

19:34.245 --> 19:36.135
But this one's my lie.

19:36.136 --> 19:41.019
And the only way to make it not
a lie is to through with it.

19:41.020 --> 19:44.012
Well, I'm still bungee
jumping with you.

19:44.013 --> 19:49.913
You know what they say, "if your friend
jumps off a bridge, you should too."

19:50.051 --> 19:53.230
I don't think that's
what they say.

19:53.231 --> 19:57.191
Anyway, how bad
can it really be?

19:59.044 --> 20:01.338
Okay, this is bad.
Really really bad.

20:01.339 --> 20:03.073
- Totally bad.
- This is bad.

20:03.074 --> 20:08.974
I can't believe our parents
signed permission slips for this.

20:08.986 --> 20:12.402
I'm gonna go down to the ground
so I can snap pics of the jump.

20:12.403 --> 20:14.190
Wow.

20:14.191 --> 20:16.813
That's far down. You
guys are crazy.

20:16.814 --> 20:19.214
With a "K"!

20:24.338 --> 20:26.376
What's she doing here?

20:26.377 --> 20:29.704
Do you how hard it is to fire
someone doesn't speak English?

20:29.705 --> 20:31.276
You're fired!

20:31.277 --> 20:34.577
Austin Moon my boyfriend.

20:36.244 --> 20:38.830
I don't know if I can
go through with this.

20:38.831 --> 20:42.851
Hold my hand. We'll
jump together.

20:43.452 --> 20:46.441
Give me a second
to think about it.

20:46.442 --> 20:48.487
Take all the time you need.

20:48.488 --> 20:52.437
Austin! Why didn't you tell me
you had a supermodel girlfriend?

20:52.438 --> 20:54.640
Time's up. Let's jump!

20:54.641 --> 20:56.561
Whoa!

20:59.596 --> 21:02.880
- Woo-hoo-hoo!
- This is the coolest thing ever.

21:02.881 --> 21:04.835
Cool with a "K"! Woo!

21:04.836 --> 21:07.315
Austin Moon my boyfriend.

21:07.316 --> 21:10.616
Austin Moon my boyfriend.

21:11.483 --> 21:13.417
Trish, take my hand.

21:13.418 --> 21:14.916
We'll jump together.

21:14.917 --> 21:17.021
Eh. That's okay.

21:17.022 --> 21:18.822
Ah!

21:20.894 --> 21:23.594
I'm gonna puke!

21:23.673 --> 21:29.023
I can't do it! I'm going to
call my mom to come pick me up!

21:29.024 --> 21:31.304
I got it!

21:31.758 --> 21:34.875
I'll never find my phone.

21:34.876 --> 21:38.056
Could somebody call it?

21:38.189 --> 21:41.729
Forget it, it's on vibrate.

21:46.309 --> 21:48.056
It's the same price as a
normal slice of pizza.

21:48.057 --> 21:49.233
- Yeah.
- But it's so weird.

21:49.234 --> 21:51.146
Guess who's on the cover
of "Cheetah Beat"?

21:51.147 --> 21:53.547
Oh, awesome!

21:54.600 --> 21:57.453
Ally even made it
in the background.

21:57.454 --> 22:01.783
Well, it's not my best photo, but hey,
I made the cover of "Cheetah Beat"!

22:01.784 --> 22:05.260
Yeah. I'm just glad all
that lying is done.

22:05.261 --> 22:06.939
I never want to do that again.

22:06.940 --> 22:08.432
And I never want to
see Megan again.

22:08.433 --> 22:09.908
If I have to spend one
more minute with that...

22:09.909 --> 22:12.369
Hello, Angel.

22:12.514 --> 22:14.236
Hi, BFFs.

22:14.237 --> 22:17.950
I had so much fun, I decided to
hang out with you this weekend too.

22:17.951 --> 22:19.644
What?

22:19.645 --> 22:22.561
So, who's ready to hang?

22:22.562 --> 22:25.180
Uh, can't today.
Astronaut training.

22:25.181 --> 22:27.626
Me either. Flying
to Italy for pizza.

22:27.627 --> 22:29.577
Oh, I have to go feed my...

22:29.578 --> 22:32.480
- Mermaid.
- I honestly...

22:32.481 --> 22:33.781
Have no plans.

22:33.782 --> 22:36.044
We get to hang? I am...

22:36.045 --> 22:38.205
<i>Freaking!</i>

22:39.089 --> 22:41.189
Me too.
