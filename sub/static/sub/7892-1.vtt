01:21.815 --> 01:23.214
Lord Thomas.

01:25.885 --> 01:27.250
Lord Henry.

01:28.521 --> 01:30.216
Lord Ambrose.

01:32.659 --> 01:34.024
Lord Robert.

01:36.529 --> 01:37.928
Lord Walter.

01:41.367 --> 01:42.800
You'd better not let me down,
Charles Grey.

01:42.902 --> 01:48.033
- I've got 20 guineas riding on you.
- Only 20? I'd double that if I were you.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.007
Come on,
ladies.

01:58.651 --> 02:02.382
Gentlemen, twice around the course,
on my count.

02:05.158 --> 02:06.853
Three, two,

02:09.128 --> 02:10.390
one!

02:10.497 --> 02:12.021
- Come on, Mr. Grey!
- Come on, Thomas!

02:12.132 --> 02:15.101
- Come on, Mr. Grey!
- Run, Lord Walter!

02:15.635 --> 02:17.466
Come on, Mr. Grey!

02:17.570 --> 02:20.232
Come on, Mr. Grey.
You're tired already.

02:20.340 --> 02:22.900
- Come on, Mr. Grey!
- Faster!

02:37.056 --> 02:40.514
I trust Your Grace still finds Georgiana
an attractive girl?

02:40.627 --> 02:42.618
Of course, Lady Spencer.

02:42.729 --> 02:46.563
She's an accomplished lady of quality
and devoted to her duties.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.294
She's fluent in French, Italian, Latin

02:49.402 --> 02:52.200
and fully versed in horsemanship
and dancing and...

02:52.305 --> 02:56.173
Yes, I'm aware of all that.
She's a credit to you.

02:58.044 --> 02:59.841
I can't think of anything
that would stand in the way

02:59.946 --> 03:02.107
of a singularly happy marriage.

03:02.215 --> 03:05.514
These are not the issues
that burden the Duke, Lady Spencer.

03:05.618 --> 03:08.815
It is His Grace's duty to produce an heir.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.287
On the other hand,
your daughter may expect

03:10.390 --> 03:12.858
a handsome reward when that occurs.

03:12.959 --> 03:16.258
- Thank you, Heaton.
- Your Grace.

03:17.430 --> 03:19.295
Your Grace may rest assured.

03:19.399 --> 03:22.857
The women in our family
have never forfeited on that account.

03:24.170 --> 03:26.764
Well, with that assurance...

03:36.049 --> 03:37.573
So be it, then.

03:39.819 --> 03:41.616
Come on, Mr. Grey!

03:49.629 --> 03:53.861
I do apologize, ladies,
but it appears that my horse has won.

03:55.468 --> 03:57.197
Beat me again, Charles.

03:59.272 --> 04:03.003
- Well done, Mr. Grey.
- Well done.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.701
- So how much do we owe you?
- You owe me 40.

04:05.812 --> 04:09.942
- Twenty, 40.
- My reward?

04:15.054 --> 04:17.522
And what do you suggest?

04:17.624 --> 04:20.616
Your mother wishes to see you,
Lady Georgiana.

04:32.505 --> 04:33.836
Thank you.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.958
I must apologize, Mama.
Were we making too much noise?

04:53.059 --> 04:54.617
Not at all, my darling.

04:54.727 --> 04:58.026
We have more important things
to talk of. Come here.

05:06.172 --> 05:09.608
- I have heard a rumor.
- Yes?

05:11.010 --> 05:12.807
That I will soon be addressing
my daughter

05:12.912 --> 05:16.006
as Her Grace,
the Duchess of Devonshire.

05:17.583 --> 05:20.211
- Is it true, Mama?
- It is.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.555
The Duke of Devonshire?

05:29.128 --> 05:32.291
I had hoped not to part with you
until 18 at the soonest,

05:32.398 --> 05:33.422
but, with such a fine match,

05:33.533 --> 05:36.127
it would be selfish of me
not to let you go.

05:36.235 --> 05:38.135
- He loves me?
- Yes, of course.

05:38.237 --> 05:40.000
I have only met him twice.

05:40.106 --> 05:41.539
When one truly loves someone,

05:41.641 --> 05:44.041
one doesn't have to know them well
to be sure, Georgiana.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.145
One feels it right away.

05:48.648 --> 05:53.585
- I do believe you will be happy with him.
- I shall, Mama. I know I shall.

07:31.484 --> 07:32.974
- Come on!
- She's here!

07:33.085 --> 07:35.178
Your Grace! Your Grace!

07:43.262 --> 07:44.991
- There she is!
- Duchess!

07:45.097 --> 07:47.565
What do they want?

07:47.667 --> 07:50.465
To see me and my new wife, of course.

07:52.605 --> 07:55.699
It can be a nuisance,
but you'll get used to it.

08:51.797 --> 08:53.560
Welcome, Your Grace.

09:10.149 --> 09:13.084
Come, boys. Come on.
Hugo, Hugo. Come.

09:13.185 --> 09:16.450
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

09:17.857 --> 09:21.122
It's all right. Yes, yes. This way.

09:22.995 --> 09:24.986
Hugo. Come, boy. Come.

10:01.534 --> 10:05.868
Scissors. You may go.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.803
For the life of me,
I could never understand

10:40.906 --> 10:44.103
why women's clothes
must be so damn complicated.

10:46.278 --> 10:49.645
It's just our way
of expressing ourselves, I suppose.

10:53.219 --> 10:55.983
Whatever do you mean?

10:56.088 --> 10:59.649
Well, you have so many ways
of expressing yourselves,

10:59.759 --> 11:03.991
whereas we must make do
with our hats and our dresses.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.399
Would you go to the bed?

12:45.064 --> 12:47.760
One has to accept one's responsibility.

12:47.867 --> 12:49.528
Certain obligations come with marriage,

12:49.635 --> 12:51.569
no matter how burdensome
they may seem.

12:51.670 --> 12:54.434
Yes, but when we are together...

12:56.142 --> 12:59.942
But when we are together, intimately,
I mean...

13:00.045 --> 13:02.377
I know. It can be a bother.

13:02.481 --> 13:05.245
However, it is only
until you have given him a son.

13:05.351 --> 13:09.947
Then the occasions will become fewer
and less determined.

13:10.055 --> 13:11.647
I think it might feel different

13:11.757 --> 13:14.624
if he would talk to me
every once in a while.

13:14.727 --> 13:18.686
I mean, it's not that he's unkind,
but he never talks to me.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.060
I thought that he would be like Papa,

13:20.166 --> 13:22.293
that under his cool reserve

13:22.401 --> 13:24.995
there'd be a wealth of depth
and sentiment,

13:25.104 --> 13:30.633
but he isn't interested in anything,
apart from his dogs.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.574
Try not to be too hard on His Grace, G.

13:32.678 --> 13:35.738
He's merely intent on fulfilling his duty.

13:35.848 --> 13:40.217
And as for talking to him,
well, whatever is there to talk about?

13:40.319 --> 13:42.947
No, you're quite right.

13:43.055 --> 13:45.285
How foolish of me to think
that I should be able to converse

13:45.391 --> 13:47.382
with my husband.

13:47.493 --> 13:51.486
Georgiana, equip yourself with patience,
fortitude and resignation.

13:51.597 --> 13:54.760
A boy will come soon enough,
and then you'll see.

14:02.608 --> 14:09.172
But we, the Whig Party, simply see this
as just, right and sensible.

14:09.348 --> 14:15.753
Just to bring independence to America.
Right to abolish the slave trade.

14:16.789 --> 14:20.520
And sensible to bring freedom
to the common man,

14:20.626 --> 14:25.586
so the blessings of this blessed plot,
this England,

14:25.698 --> 14:30.635
may be more equally enjoyed
by all of its inhabitants.

14:37.142 --> 14:40.873
I would like to propose a toast
to our host and benefactor

14:40.980 --> 14:45.974
His Grace the Duke
and his beautiful new Duchess.

14:46.085 --> 14:47.882
Please be upstanding.

14:52.725 --> 14:58.027
- The Duke and Duchess!
- The Duke and Duchess!

15:07.806 --> 15:09.535
Excellent speech, Mr. Fox.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.839
I thank you. It is always easier
to address a congregation of friends,

15:12.945 --> 15:16.847
particularly when those friends
are drunk.

15:16.949 --> 15:20.851
And how did the Duchess find
Mr. Fox's speech?

15:20.953 --> 15:24.286
I must confess, I am not yet at ease
with political speeches.

15:24.390 --> 15:27.518
Their very form tends to obstruct
my view of their actual meaning,

15:27.626 --> 15:29.719
if such there be.

15:29.828 --> 15:31.762
In which particular section
of the speech

15:31.864 --> 15:34.594
did the message elude Your Grace?

15:36.268 --> 15:39.465
Well, I have great sympathy
with your sentiments in general,

15:39.571 --> 15:44.372
but I fail to fully comprehend
how far we, the Whig Party, that is,

15:44.476 --> 15:47.240
are fully committed
to the concept of freedom.

15:47.379 --> 15:50.314
- We intend to extend the vote.
- To all men?

15:50.416 --> 15:54.876
Heavens, no. But certainly to more men.
Freedom in moderation.

15:54.987 --> 15:57.512
- "Freedom in moderation"?
- Precisely.

15:59.058 --> 16:01.618
I'm sure you are
full of the best intentions, Mr. Fox,

16:01.727 --> 16:04.093
but I dare say
I would not spend my vote,

16:04.196 --> 16:08.895
if I had it, of course,
on so vague a statement.

16:09.001 --> 16:13.301
One is either free or one is not.
The concept of freedom is an absolute.

16:13.405 --> 16:15.566
After all,
one cannot be moderately dead

16:15.674 --> 16:19.974
or moderately loved or moderately free.

16:20.079 --> 16:22.980
It must always remain
a matter of either or.

16:26.485 --> 16:29.648
I think it appropriate to say a few words.

16:29.755 --> 16:30.949
When...

16:55.247 --> 16:56.271
Could you check the chamber

16:56.382 --> 16:57.576
- and see if you can find...
- Your Grace.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.174
...different kinds of French lace?

17:02.588 --> 17:06.046
- Is anything the matter?
- No.

17:07.859 --> 17:11.261
- You just left.
- Yes. Well, I had done eating,

17:11.363 --> 17:13.991
and those damn speeches
bore me to distraction.

17:14.098 --> 17:16.260
I think we have to ban them
in the future.

17:16.367 --> 17:20.327
But you are the Whigs' main supporter.

17:20.439 --> 17:22.999
Yes. Well,
I've no problem with the politics.

17:23.108 --> 17:25.702
It's just the rhetoric I can't stand.

17:28.714 --> 17:33.674
- Shall I come with you?
- No. I mean, why ever should you?

17:57.076 --> 18:00.807
The Duke is perfectly well.
He simply wanted to rest a while.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.813
Do sit down, gentlemen.

18:09.955 --> 18:13.823
Was it the length of the speech
that got the better of the Duke?

18:14.460 --> 18:16.690
Certainly not.

18:16.795 --> 18:17.819
He enjoyed it immensely

18:17.930 --> 18:21.661
and expressed a hope
that next time it would be even longer.

18:23.502 --> 18:26.994
- Your Grace.
- Mr. Fox.

18:54.199 --> 18:57.726
- What's going on?
- Nothing to concern you.

18:59.104 --> 19:02.437
- I don't understand.
- Come here.

19:11.617 --> 19:15.314
You look very beautiful tonight.
Is this dress your design?

19:18.957 --> 19:20.822
Yes, it is. Thank you.

19:27.866 --> 19:31.165
Then I think you should allow
your husband to appreciate it

19:31.270 --> 19:33.238
in a little more detail.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.771
Come here.

20:07.639 --> 20:11.598
- Yes, send them in.
- Are we having company?

20:12.878 --> 20:15.870
Don't you think
this mutton has a funny taste?

20:17.583 --> 20:21.144
- No. Not really, no.
- I think it does.

20:30.262 --> 20:36.690
G, this is Charlotte,
and she will be staying with us.

20:40.672 --> 20:41.730
Why?

20:53.418 --> 20:57.718
Because her mother is dead,
and she has no other place to go.

21:01.827 --> 21:04.022
Have you fathered that child?

21:05.264 --> 21:10.133
It's... It's only a little girl, G.
It's hardly the end of the world.

21:12.170 --> 21:16.732
- Are you expecting me to look after her?
- We have a house full of vacant rooms.

21:16.842 --> 21:19.504
She needn't bother you.
In fact, she may even be of use to you.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.307
You can practice your mothering skills,

21:24.049 --> 21:27.177
until our son arrives.

21:30.722 --> 21:32.246
No, this doesn't taste
like normal mutton.

21:32.357 --> 21:36.691
I'm sure there is something the matter
with it. Could you take it away?

21:40.098 --> 21:42.464
Does it taste like normal mutton?

21:43.769 --> 21:47.227
Does it taste like normal mutton?
Come here.

21:49.107 --> 21:52.201
Think it tastes like normal mutton,
fussy dog?

21:52.311 --> 21:54.302
Who's a fussy mutton dog?

22:07.225 --> 22:09.284
Does your doll have a name?

22:14.166 --> 22:17.101
I bet you
she loves being in her new bedroom.

22:20.238 --> 22:24.174
You'll have to think of a name
and let me know tomorrow.

22:24.276 --> 22:27.473
Do you think
you'll be able to do that, Charlotte?

22:29.414 --> 22:30.745
I...

22:30.849 --> 22:33.784
- Would you leave us, please?
- Your Grace.

22:46.431 --> 22:48.058
Hello, Charlotte.

22:54.172 --> 22:55.969
My name is Georgiana.

23:19.664 --> 23:22.155
- Good evening.
- Thank you.

23:25.637 --> 23:27.434
Good evening, ladies.

23:31.042 --> 23:34.102
An inch more and I do believe
Your Grace will explode.

23:34.212 --> 23:37.443
Sheridan always knows
how to pay a compliment.

23:37.549 --> 23:39.107
Still a few more weeks to wait.

23:39.217 --> 23:42.209
A huge belly has never been
more becoming on anyone.

23:42.320 --> 23:46.347
Well, Fox, here, offers an expert opinion
seeing, as he does, a giant belly

23:46.458 --> 23:48.585
every time he passes a mirror.

23:48.693 --> 23:51.355
If your belly were on a woman, well,
we'd all know what to think.

23:51.463 --> 23:55.160
My dear Sheridan,
an hour ago my belly was on a woman.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.030
Now what do you think?

23:57.135 --> 24:01.265
That will teach you to insult Mr. Fox
before the gaming has begun.

24:05.644 --> 24:07.168
It's very good.

24:14.252 --> 24:16.083
No more bets, please.

24:22.794 --> 24:23.954
Seven.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.594
Her Grace wins again.

24:30.068 --> 24:31.558
Another wager?

24:33.371 --> 24:36.272
- Are you all right, Your Grace?
- Your Grace!

24:42.380 --> 24:45.406
Are those labor pains?
My wife is in labor.

24:46.117 --> 24:47.084
Come along.

24:47.185 --> 24:49.517
I think this calls for a toast.

24:49.621 --> 24:52.454
I may have an heir
before the night is out.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.360
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the sixth Duke of Devonshire.

24:57.462 --> 25:00.522
The sixth Duke of Devonshire!

25:26.291 --> 25:30.058
- Your Grace.
- I am in no mood for a conversation.

25:30.161 --> 25:32.391
But, pray tell me, is my daughter...

25:32.497 --> 25:36.194
Is your daughter at all able
to give me a son?

25:36.301 --> 25:37.825
Take heart, Your Grace.

25:37.936 --> 25:39.597
As long as the mother is in good health,

25:39.704 --> 25:41.695
consider this mishap a draft,

25:41.806 --> 25:44.240
a promise of what is soon to come.

25:44.776 --> 25:47.472
- In our family, we...
- Yes, I know, in your family,

25:47.579 --> 25:49.206
in your family.

25:52.417 --> 25:53.782
Your Grace.

25:56.955 --> 26:00.391
Can you see the light? Can you see it?

26:08.300 --> 26:10.996
- Darling, how are you?
- Quite well.

26:12.270 --> 26:16.673
- Is she strong and healthy?
- She's perfect.

26:22.814 --> 26:25.647
- Did William receive you?
- Yes.

26:27.285 --> 26:29.685
Is he upset that she's not a son?

26:32.223 --> 26:35.590
He just glanced at her and then left.
I've hardly seen him since.

26:35.694 --> 26:37.685
It's been a difficult time for His Grace,
my dear.

26:37.796 --> 26:41.254
Many eyes are upon him
and not all of them kind.

26:44.636 --> 26:46.433
She is the loveliest.

26:49.140 --> 26:51.574
- Nurse?
- No, I will feed her.

26:51.676 --> 26:54.008
- Are you sure, darling?
- Yes.

26:58.083 --> 27:02.315
I am her mother, after all,
even if she is only a girl.

27:05.156 --> 27:06.123
There.

27:07.826 --> 27:09.555
Hell and damnation!

27:51.536 --> 27:53.231
It is always a pleasure

27:53.338 --> 27:57.240
when one is on holiday
to request a few words of wisdom.

27:57.342 --> 27:58.934
And so without further ado,

27:59.044 --> 28:03.743
it is a great honor to hand over
to our most distinguished guest.

28:03.848 --> 28:06.874
When she arrives,
all eyes are upon her.

28:06.985 --> 28:11.012
When absent, she is the subject
of universal conversation.

28:11.122 --> 28:13.113
And what we see her wearing tonight,

28:13.224 --> 28:17.183
I look forward to seeing
the rest of you wearing tomorrow!

28:17.295 --> 28:22.392
The empress of fashion herself,
the Duchess of Devonshire.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.338
We come away to Bath
to get away from London,

28:34.446 --> 28:36.641
and all of London
has come away to Bath.

28:38.316 --> 28:40.113
Somebody did indeed ask me

28:40.218 --> 28:42.709
what kind of feather it is
that I'm wearing.

28:42.821 --> 28:46.848
Well, there are only two specimens
of this rare bird known to man.

28:46.958 --> 28:51.224
One of them has clearly ended up
on top of my head.

28:51.329 --> 28:55.595
And the other, rumor has it,
is running for office in the Tory Party.

29:20.191 --> 29:21.590
Bess Foster.

29:32.637 --> 29:33.968
Excuse me.

30:09.574 --> 30:15.308
- I don't believe we've been introduced.
- No, we haven't. Lady Elizabeth Foster.

30:15.413 --> 30:19.941
- I saw you talking with my husband.
- Yes. He wanted to dance.

30:21.152 --> 30:26.146
That's not usually considered his forte.
And you declined?

30:27.392 --> 30:30.555
I'm ill at ease with male company
for the moment.

30:33.798 --> 30:35.129
Thank you.

30:36.134 --> 30:38.227
So what brings you to Bath?

30:41.372 --> 30:45.069
My husband, Mr. Foster,
is enjoying his mistress in Bournemouth

30:45.176 --> 30:48.145
and I wanted some diversion. And you?

30:51.482 --> 30:54.315
The Duke is taking the waters
for his gout.

30:55.620 --> 30:57.815
- And I for my health.
- Really?

30:58.756 --> 31:02.157
I heard you were here
because you could not conceive a son.

31:02.260 --> 31:06.594
I beg your pardon,
that was an awful thing to say.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.393
It was the truth, at least.

31:08.499 --> 31:11.127
Trust me to say something silly.
I always do, you know.

31:11.236 --> 31:14.171
Then perhaps you should
have accepted the Duke's offer.

31:14.272 --> 31:16.240
You have much in common.

31:28.219 --> 31:30.847
Home, I think, Georgiana.

31:39.597 --> 31:43.124
- Where are you staying?
- I've rented some rooms in town.

31:44.369 --> 31:46.769
- We must meet again.
- We must.

32:03.688 --> 32:07.624
Harryo. Come here. Come here.
Did that hurt?

32:07.725 --> 32:10.216
- Mama.
- My angel.

32:11.229 --> 32:15.495
Are you sore? Was that sore?
Let me have a look. Was it this knee?

32:16.935 --> 32:18.698
I think you shall live.

32:18.803 --> 32:23.297
Right. First to the bridge on my count.
One, two, three. Go.

32:23.408 --> 32:24.636
Come on, Harryo.

32:24.742 --> 32:27.905
- No, I'm gonna catch her!
- I'm gonna catch you!

32:28.012 --> 32:32.210
Up and down. Up and down.
Why can't we recover like that?

32:32.317 --> 32:34.285
It's too far to fall now.

32:34.385 --> 32:37.877
- Hello again.
- Hello. Your girls are lovely.

32:37.989 --> 32:42.983
- Thank you. Do you have any children?
- I do. Three boys.

32:43.928 --> 32:45.725
Three boys.

32:45.830 --> 32:48.731
What the Duke wouldn't give
for one of them.

32:50.435 --> 32:57.273
- She is least like you, your eldest.
- Yes. I'm sure you know the story.

33:01.479 --> 33:04.846
My husband's daughter was born
before we married.

33:04.949 --> 33:08.908
Her mother was a maid.
The maid died, and we took the child.

33:09.020 --> 33:11.887
- I'm sorry. Have I spoken out of turn?
- No.

33:11.990 --> 33:15.687
It's the worst-kept secret in London.
She's nine years old now.

33:15.793 --> 33:17.522
And you love her?

33:17.628 --> 33:20.529
Of course I do.
The same as all my children.

33:24.068 --> 33:26.332
Come and meet them.

33:26.437 --> 33:30.168
Girls. Come and meet my new friend,
Lady Elizabeth.

33:36.914 --> 33:40.543
- Your Grace.
- Thank you. Thermal water.

33:42.587 --> 33:44.487
It's the sulfur
that makes it smell so bad.

33:44.589 --> 33:48.423
- And you really have to drink it?
- Twice a day for four weeks.

33:49.861 --> 33:53.922
Do you have any reason to believe
you cannot birth a male?

33:54.032 --> 33:57.559
No. Except miscarriages.

33:59.804 --> 34:01.931
Two stillbirths, both sons.

34:04.976 --> 34:06.841
But two healthy girls.

34:17.054 --> 34:19.181
Everybody is staring at you.

34:24.362 --> 34:28.661
What's that on your neck? Bess?

34:31.202 --> 34:34.034
It's not illegal for a man
to beat his wife with a stick

34:34.138 --> 34:37.130
unless the stick is thicker
than his thumb.

34:37.241 --> 34:41.199
Mr. Foster? But he can't have done that!

34:41.312 --> 34:43.906
Well, considering what else
he's done to me, that's not the worst.

34:44.014 --> 34:45.447
What could possibly be worse?

34:45.550 --> 34:48.713
He's taken my children.
He won't let me see them.

34:55.092 --> 34:59.427
- And what do you propose to do?
- Really, I'm at my wits' end.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.960
The law supports Mr. Foster.

35:06.604 --> 35:09.596
In the meantime, where shall you stay?

35:09.707 --> 35:12.505
Continue lodging,
till the money runs out.

35:16.581 --> 35:19.414
Well, there, at least, I think I can help.

35:26.757 --> 35:29.089
William? We leave tomorrow.

35:31.996 --> 35:36.194
And Lady Elizabeth doesn't have
to meet her parents on the continent

35:36.300 --> 35:38.495
for some time.

35:38.603 --> 35:43.472
- She hardly ever visits London at all.
- It's a pity, that.

35:46.344 --> 35:49.177
You see,
she doesn't have anywhere to stay.

35:52.183 --> 35:53.673
Problem there.

35:56.320 --> 36:00.848
Well, why doesn't she stay with us?
For a while, at least.

36:03.194 --> 36:04.525
Thank you.

36:10.101 --> 36:12.934
- This is incredible.
- There's the castle in Ireland.

36:13.037 --> 36:18.339
Bolton Abbey, Chiswick, Burlington
and, why, in Chatsworth, of course.

36:18.442 --> 36:21.434
- Of course.
- Which is much bigger.

36:21.546 --> 36:23.639
But this is more like home.

36:28.486 --> 36:31.011
I'm so glad you're here.

36:31.122 --> 36:33.818
I've arranged a wonderful start
to the season.

36:38.129 --> 36:42.031
May all the plagues of marriage
be doubled on me

36:42.133 --> 36:47.332
if ever I try to be friends
with you anymore!

36:47.438 --> 36:49.167
So much the better.

36:52.543 --> 36:56.502
No, no, madam.
'Tis evident you care not a pin for me!

36:57.048 --> 37:01.314
And I, I was a madman to marry you.

37:01.419 --> 37:05.753
And I'm sure I was a fool to marry you,

37:05.856 --> 37:09.223
an old dangling bachelor

37:12.096 --> 37:14.326
who was single at 50

37:14.432 --> 37:18.493
only because he never could meet
with anyone who could have him!

37:40.224 --> 37:44.092
Bess, may I introduce Mr. Fox,
leader of the Opposition?

37:44.195 --> 37:47.596
- Mr. Fox, Lady Elizabeth Foster.
- Mr. Fox.

37:47.698 --> 37:51.794
- My protégé, Charles Grey.
- Mr. Grey.

37:51.902 --> 37:53.529
- Mr. Grey.
- Your Grace.

37:53.638 --> 37:56.072
He's our newest bright young man.

37:56.173 --> 38:00.007
Scarcely out of Cambridge
and already a member of Parliament.

38:01.312 --> 38:04.145
- I always felt you'd do well.
- Thank you.

38:04.248 --> 38:06.478
- Mr. Fox.
- Yes, Lady Elizabeth.

38:07.485 --> 38:13.481
- Did you enjoy the play?
- I must confess, I did not entirely.

38:15.426 --> 38:17.291
I hope that you've not lost
your sense of humor

38:17.395 --> 38:19.955
- since entering politics.
- Not that I'm aware.

38:20.064 --> 38:21.656
Then I'm sure you realize
that <i>School for Scandal</i>

38:21.766 --> 38:24.792
- was written as a comedy.
- Yes.

38:24.902 --> 38:28.895
Although, from where I sat,
it read as a tragedy.

38:29.006 --> 38:32.942
Your Grace! How we have missed you.

38:33.044 --> 38:34.033
In your absence,

38:34.145 --> 38:36.875
London has been reduced
to the dreariest province.

38:36.981 --> 38:39.711
And this, of course,
is the playwright Mr. Sheridan.

38:39.817 --> 38:42.115
May I present
the Lady Elizabeth Foster?

38:42.219 --> 38:43.345
I do not mean to be rude,

38:43.454 --> 38:45.615
but I've an entire cast
dying to meet the Duchess.

38:45.723 --> 38:48.453
I shall return you in a moment. Promise.

38:51.262 --> 38:52.229
- Mr. Fox?
- Yes.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.354
A word.

38:53.464 --> 38:58.094
Well, wherever do I glean
such domestic gossip?

38:58.202 --> 39:01.296
- Were we fair on the Duke?
- It could have been worse.

39:01.405 --> 39:04.101
My original title was <i>The Bad Marriage.</i>

39:08.079 --> 39:10.377
Is it always like this?

39:10.481 --> 39:12.278
Well, as they say,

39:12.383 --> 39:14.613
the Duke of Devonshire
must be the only man in England

39:14.719 --> 39:16.619
not in love with his wife.

39:18.489 --> 39:20.787
- Her Grace, the Duchess of Devonshire.
- Very pleased to meet you.

39:29.633 --> 39:32.693
Were you at all able to forget things
and enjoy yourself?

39:32.803 --> 39:36.739
It was a wonderful distraction,
thank you.

39:36.841 --> 39:37.933
Good.

39:41.545 --> 39:44.946
- I talked to Mr. Grey all evening.
- Yes?

39:46.984 --> 39:48.474
He's in love with you.

39:48.586 --> 39:53.649
My dear Bess, no, he is not.
Quite the reverse, I fear.

39:53.758 --> 39:57.455
Well, can't you tell
by the way he looks at you?

39:57.561 --> 40:00.496
- Honestly, can't you tell?
- Stop it.

40:03.000 --> 40:07.460
Georgiana,
intercourse is not just about offspring.

40:09.173 --> 40:14.372
- In fact, it can be rather pleasurable.
- Yes, I know.

40:17.248 --> 40:22.117
Close your eyes
and try to envisage Grey

40:22.219 --> 40:26.349
opening your dress, kissing your back.

40:26.457 --> 40:29.449
- They never do such things.
- Yes, they do.

40:37.101 --> 40:38.693
Close your eyes.

40:44.241 --> 40:48.940
Grey is behind you
slowly opening your dress.

40:49.046 --> 40:51.446
- No, Bess, stop!
- Close your eyes.

41:07.998 --> 41:09.659
Kissing your back.

41:32.656 --> 41:33.816
There.

41:35.092 --> 41:36.389
See?

42:08.993 --> 42:11.188
- Would you excuse me for a minute?
- You must excuse me, gentlemen.

42:11.295 --> 42:13.729
- Your Grace.
- Mr. Grey.

42:13.831 --> 42:16.459
The national election
is in six weeks, yes?

42:16.567 --> 42:18.592
How is the campaign going?

42:21.472 --> 42:22.700
Terribly.

42:23.841 --> 42:27.333
Our only hope
is to save Westminster for Fox.

42:27.444 --> 42:29.674
I have many faults, as you well know.

42:29.780 --> 42:33.409
Not least among them
is my ability to draw attention.

42:34.552 --> 42:37.385
Perhaps we could use that
to our advantage.

42:53.470 --> 42:55.267
Ladies and gentlemen.

42:56.974 --> 42:59.966
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the man

43:00.077 --> 43:02.773
who will inform us
of the work we must do

43:02.880 --> 43:07.510
and of the party we so believe in.
Mr. Charles Grey.

43:15.459 --> 43:18.826
Good people of Westminster!

43:18.929 --> 43:24.231
The world is on the brink of disaster
or salvation!

43:24.335 --> 43:25.996
From France to America,

43:26.103 --> 43:29.095
men and women are struggling
to free themselves,

43:29.206 --> 43:32.607
to find meaning in their existence!

43:32.710 --> 43:35.201
Change is upon us!

43:37.681 --> 43:40.377
We shall not go back to the old ways.

43:40.484 --> 43:45.649
We shall take England
into this brave new world

43:45.756 --> 43:48.554
and shake the thunder from the skies!

44:01.605 --> 44:06.338
- How did I do?
- I think it was not an embarrassment.

44:07.845 --> 44:10.075
It was a marvel.

44:10.180 --> 44:14.173
I was nervous. Your presence
trebled the numbers at least.

44:18.188 --> 44:19.985
I'm nervous even now.

44:22.126 --> 44:26.028
If we win this election,
if we get the power,

44:26.130 --> 44:28.098
think what we will do.

44:28.198 --> 44:30.996
Do you think of me
when we're not together?

44:32.202 --> 44:35.694
You ought to know I do.

44:35.806 --> 44:38.434
- You hesitated before you replied.
- No.

44:48.252 --> 44:50.880
I'm unused to being asked so directly.

44:54.291 --> 44:56.316
And by you, of all people.

44:59.430 --> 45:03.867
I think of you all the time. I always have.

45:10.541 --> 45:13.533
- Your carriage awaits, Your Grace.
- Thank you.

45:15.479 --> 45:17.811
...this we vow!

45:45.209 --> 45:48.372
What are you doing outside
Lady Elizabeth's room?

45:53.751 --> 45:55.719
Who's in there with her?

47:01.983 --> 47:07.979
Of all the women in England
you had to throw yourself on her.

47:12.193 --> 47:17.722
I have never once objected
to any of your affairs.

47:20.034 --> 47:24.095
I have accepted whatever arrangement
you have proposed.

47:25.740 --> 47:29.403
I have raised Charlotte
as my own daughter.

47:32.447 --> 47:33.812
But this...

47:36.918 --> 47:41.048
I have one single thing of my own.

47:44.292 --> 47:47.489
Why couldn't you let me keep Elizabeth
for myself?

47:49.897 --> 47:52.525
What kind of man are you?

47:55.670 --> 48:01.370
She is my sole comfort in our marriage.
You have robbed me of my only friend!

48:10.852 --> 48:12.717
What is wrong with me?

48:38.112 --> 48:39.170
I...

48:41.215 --> 48:47.586
I've never claimed
to be a man of fine sensibility, G.

48:47.688 --> 48:50.953
But I've always known
what I expect from this marriage

48:51.058 --> 48:53.288
and what I'm prepared to give.

48:54.562 --> 48:58.555
As a husband,
I have fulfilled my obligations.

48:58.666 --> 49:01.931
But, as a wife,

49:04.305 --> 49:06.432
you have not.

49:06.541 --> 49:09.942
She has to go. Now.

49:10.044 --> 49:12.638
She is never to set foot
in this house again!

49:12.747 --> 49:14.681
Do mind your temper, G.
You're forgetting yourself.

49:16.150 --> 49:17.674
I want her out.

49:19.921 --> 49:24.654
I never want to lay eyes on her again.
Go down and tell her to leave at once.

49:29.263 --> 49:31.197
I couldn't ask her that.

49:33.868 --> 49:35.495
I won't do it, G.

49:52.787 --> 49:57.986
- I never liked her from the first.
- You made that quite clear, Mama.

49:58.092 --> 50:00.822
She's gone from Devonshire House,
I hope.

50:04.899 --> 50:06.890
They're living there together?

50:07.001 --> 50:09.333
Georgiana!
What have you permitted to happen?

50:09.437 --> 50:13.066
I don't know. I don't know.

50:13.174 --> 50:16.871
Help me. Help me, please, Mama.
Tell me what to do.

50:21.382 --> 50:25.478
You must write to your husband
and insist he send her back

50:25.586 --> 50:27.747
to whatever horrid little place
she came from.

50:27.855 --> 50:32.622
He will not.
"It is out of the question," he says.

50:38.366 --> 50:42.200
Then you must return
and resume your duties.

50:42.303 --> 50:44.828
Make him realize whom he loves.

50:44.939 --> 50:47.703
You will give up your politics
and your gambling.

50:47.808 --> 50:51.107
For once,
you will devote yourself as a loving wife

50:51.212 --> 50:55.171
and settle down to the task in hand,
providing him with an heir.

50:56.584 --> 50:58.814
Then he will soon tire of her.

51:07.628 --> 51:09.619
You have no other option.

51:48.569 --> 51:49.866
Hello, G.

51:52.139 --> 51:53.367
William.

52:26.807 --> 52:30.800
I may not have the authority
to remove you from my house,

52:30.911 --> 52:33.539
but I can, at least,
order you out of my room.

52:33.647 --> 52:36.013
Won't you please let me explain?

52:37.618 --> 52:38.676
There is nothing to explain.

52:38.786 --> 52:42.278
This is my only chance
of ever seeing my children again.

52:43.557 --> 52:45.752
The Duke is the most powerful peer
in England.

52:45.860 --> 52:47.088
He is my only chance.

52:47.194 --> 52:51.130
There are limits to the sacrifices
one makes for one's children.

52:51.232 --> 52:55.328
No, there aren't. No limits whatsoever.

52:58.472 --> 52:59.700
Get out.

53:03.644 --> 53:06.613
We have nothing more
to say to one another.

53:59.533 --> 54:00.864
Mama, Mama!

54:08.275 --> 54:10.835
It's so nice to see you, Mama.

54:10.945 --> 54:13.505
Right, this is a shotgun.

54:13.614 --> 54:15.548
Your mother said
you'd be interested, yes?

54:15.649 --> 54:16.673
Yes.

54:18.285 --> 54:19.980
This is a flint. Do you see?

54:20.087 --> 54:23.113
When the flint hits there,
it causes a spark to happen.

54:23.224 --> 54:29.094
Now, the spark, it lights the gunpowder
and sends the bullet out of the gun.

54:29.196 --> 54:31.323
- Do you know how to hold it?
- No, sir.

54:31.432 --> 54:36.836
Well, it's like that.
Tuck it in there, into your right shoulder.

54:36.971 --> 54:40.600
Hold it firmly, then you can move
that hand a little further along.

54:40.708 --> 54:44.735
Can you feel how heavy it is?
You have to lean into it a bit.

54:44.845 --> 54:48.804
And keep both eyes open.
Look right along the barrel.

54:48.916 --> 54:51.282
Right along there just like that.

54:53.254 --> 54:57.156
Bang! Here, let me show you.

55:00.861 --> 55:02.192
There.

55:03.097 --> 55:05.224
It's quite heavy, isn't it?

55:06.567 --> 55:10.560
Are you thirsty?
Would you like something to drink?

55:10.671 --> 55:14.198
Are you gentlemen thirsty?
Would you like something to drink?

55:16.443 --> 55:17.774
Thank you.

56:11.599 --> 56:13.726
Did you tell the Duke
who you were meeting?

56:13.834 --> 56:14.858
No.

56:15.736 --> 56:17.670
- Did he even ask?
- No.

56:18.806 --> 56:20.967
He has other things on his mind.

56:22.676 --> 56:24.075
As do you.

56:28.515 --> 56:30.983
Would it help to unburden yourself?

56:33.754 --> 56:36.245
It's nothing I can discuss with you.

56:38.158 --> 56:40.251
Besides, it would only bore.

56:41.195 --> 56:44.130
You don't have to please others
all the time.

56:44.231 --> 56:48.258
It's what I've been brought up to do.
Difficult lesson to unlearn.

56:51.839 --> 56:54.307
Would you permit me an observation?

56:58.612 --> 57:01.740
I believe you do it
so that people will love you.

57:02.583 --> 57:05.643
- What makes you say that?
- From what I've seen.

57:07.388 --> 57:12.416
With your husband, your friends,
especially Lady Bess,

57:14.662 --> 57:16.254
even the public.

57:18.399 --> 57:20.993
I never thought of it that way before.

57:22.970 --> 57:25.165
You make me sound so pitiable.

57:31.045 --> 57:32.342
Georgiana.

57:34.581 --> 57:38.347
I've gone beyond my brief. I apologize.

57:40.254 --> 57:43.655
Please believe
it was only for your sake that I spoke.

57:44.958 --> 57:47.153
Please, tell me what is wrong.

57:51.765 --> 57:55.599
I fear I've done
some things in life too late

57:55.703 --> 57:57.534
and others too early.

58:02.176 --> 58:03.768
No, you haven't.

58:19.360 --> 58:20.691
I'm sorry.

58:58.699 --> 59:00.030
Thank you.

59:16.717 --> 59:18.048
All right.

59:21.388 --> 59:22.753
"All right"?

59:26.293 --> 59:28.193
Do you love each other?

59:30.931 --> 59:35.061
- Georgiana...
- Do you love Bess, Your Grace?

59:36.737 --> 59:40.229
- Where is all this leading?
- I make no demands on him.

59:42.576 --> 59:46.637
- And, Bess, do you love my husband?
- As I do you.

59:49.716 --> 59:51.741
And so you intend to stay?

59:54.788 --> 59:56.881
William has asked that I do.

59:58.292 --> 01:00:01.455
You couldn't find it in your heart
to refuse him?

01:00:03.697 --> 01:00:04.789
No.

01:00:09.136 --> 01:00:11.062
Then let us make a deal.

01:00:12.005 --> 01:00:14.633
- A deal?
- Yes.

01:00:17.478 --> 01:00:20.675
I give you my blessing

01:00:20.781 --> 01:00:24.649
if you will accept my feelings
for Charles Grey.

01:00:27.187 --> 01:00:28.779
I didn't realize it at first.

01:00:28.889 --> 01:00:32.416
I thought that perhaps
it was only a dalliance.

01:00:33.894 --> 01:00:35.691
It can make me happy.

01:00:40.601 --> 01:00:43.399
A deal? A deal.

01:00:44.972 --> 01:00:46.735
I don't make deals.

01:00:47.875 --> 01:00:49.308
Why would I?

01:00:51.845 --> 01:00:53.039
I'm in charge of it all.

01:00:53.146 --> 01:00:57.708
You know, I would call him out.
I would challenge him.

01:00:57.818 --> 01:00:59.445
- I'd put a bullet in his head.
- William.

01:00:59.553 --> 01:01:03.649
Be quiet. Are you determined
to make me a total laughingstock?

01:01:03.757 --> 01:01:06.487
A man who cannot sire a son,
and then a cuckold?

01:01:06.593 --> 01:01:08.754
William. Georgiana only asks
what we ourselves...

01:01:08.862 --> 01:01:10.454
Be quiet, woman!

01:01:12.599 --> 01:01:15.159
- Are you his whore?
- No.

01:01:16.436 --> 01:01:18.597
But I can't see why you'd mind.

01:01:18.705 --> 01:01:22.106
- You have Bess and three boys!
- Three boys?

01:01:24.311 --> 01:01:27.405
Do you think
I can make those bastards my heirs?

01:01:29.249 --> 01:01:31.080
Well? Do you?

01:01:41.261 --> 01:01:42.523
William!

01:02:14.795 --> 01:02:16.786
You don't know me in the least, do you?

01:02:16.897 --> 01:02:18.694
Yes, I do. We're a bad match.

01:02:18.799 --> 01:02:22.997
I asked but two things when we wed,
loyalty and a male heir.

01:02:23.103 --> 01:02:25.469
The same as your dogs!

01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:33.603
No, don't touch me! Don't touch me!

01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:37.947
Get off!

01:02:43.790 --> 01:02:45.587
Get off me!

01:02:45.692 --> 01:02:50.026
Is this how you treat her?
Is this how you treat your whore?

01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:52.155
No! No!

01:02:53.333 --> 01:02:56.359
No! No! No!

01:02:57.237 --> 01:02:58.499
No!

01:03:02.676 --> 01:03:05.270
Come with me.
Charlotte, come with me.

01:03:06.446 --> 01:03:08.073
No! No!

01:03:30.671 --> 01:03:36.906
Give me a son.
Until then, stay here and do as I say.

01:03:53.393 --> 01:03:59.332
I give you the winner.
Mr. Fox, the man of the people!

01:04:06.206 --> 01:04:12.042
And I give you the weapon,
the Duchess of Devonshire.

01:04:24.091 --> 01:04:25.683
Thank you.

01:04:25.792 --> 01:04:30.320
Thank you, all of you,
for this reception today.

01:04:32.332 --> 01:04:38.703
Today we have won the vote.
Tomorrow we define the future!

01:04:50.984 --> 01:04:52.952
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

01:04:56.490 --> 01:04:58.685
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

01:05:02.062 --> 01:05:03.359
Your Grace.

01:05:09.469 --> 01:05:10.959
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

01:05:31.591 --> 01:05:34.492
Will Your Grace give me
the favor of a dance?

01:05:58.285 --> 01:05:59.616
Steady, G.

01:06:04.424 --> 01:06:06.949
- Fire!
- Georgiana!

01:06:08.028 --> 01:06:09.086
Your Grace!

01:06:09.563 --> 01:06:11.053
Her Grace's hair!

01:06:14.034 --> 01:06:15.365
Do something!

01:06:27.147 --> 01:06:29.513
Please put out Her Grace's hair.

01:07:05.285 --> 01:07:07.310
Her Grace needs to rest.

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:09.479
As long as she follows
strict instructions

01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:12.558
there should be no impediment
to the birth.

01:07:12.659 --> 01:07:14.718
What are you talking about?

01:07:15.695 --> 01:07:17.754
The Duchess is pregnant.

01:07:49.062 --> 01:07:50.393
And there.

01:07:53.767 --> 01:07:55.394
Thank you, Heaton.

01:07:59.306 --> 01:08:00.500
Come.

01:08:12.686 --> 01:08:14.051
Your Grace.

01:08:15.689 --> 01:08:20.216
As per the terms of
His Grace's inheritance, this is for you

01:08:21.294 --> 01:08:23.091
to spend as you wish.

01:08:27.767 --> 01:08:29.394
Success at last.

01:08:38.111 --> 01:08:39.408
Georgiana.

01:08:41.715 --> 01:08:44.741
I, too, abhor this whole thing.

01:09:04.203 --> 01:09:05.728
Twist or stick?

01:09:07.173 --> 01:09:09.470
- Stick.
- Stick?

01:09:10.443 --> 01:09:12.274
I'll stick, too, then.

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:15.545
Let's see.

01:09:16.416 --> 01:09:18.145
You won. Well done.

01:09:19.219 --> 01:09:20.447
Come on.

01:09:23.122 --> 01:09:24.317
Come on.

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:27.417
Come on.

01:09:33.265 --> 01:09:35.291
Mama, you forgot to deal.

01:09:54.821 --> 01:09:57.312
- Your Grace.
- Mr. Grey.

01:09:59.359 --> 01:10:02.419
- You are recalled from France?
- For a while.

01:10:02.529 --> 01:10:04.156
No revolution yet?

01:10:05.632 --> 01:10:08.499
No, not yet,
but it's only a matter of time.

01:10:11.171 --> 01:10:15.267
- How is it you are here?
- I received an invitation.

01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:21.240
I assumed it was on behalf of the Party.
I could not say no.

01:10:21.381 --> 01:10:22.712
Of course.

01:10:30.056 --> 01:10:31.523
I bore a son.

01:10:34.327 --> 01:10:35.453
Yes.

01:10:37.764 --> 01:10:41.325
His name is
William George Spencer Cavendish,

01:10:41.434 --> 01:10:46.133
Marquis of Hartington.
We call him Hart.

01:10:46.239 --> 01:10:48.503
You and the Duke must be very pleased.

01:10:48.608 --> 01:10:49.870
We are.

01:10:53.847 --> 01:10:56.611
The Duke has gone to London
to celebrate.

01:11:02.655 --> 01:11:04.418
You have been missed.

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:08.793
Much missed.

01:11:16.035 --> 01:11:18.162
- Ten on the Queen.
- Four on five.

01:11:18.271 --> 01:11:20.239
And no more bets, please.

01:11:23.243 --> 01:11:26.337
The losing card, four.

01:11:29.415 --> 01:11:32.111
The winning card, Queen.

01:11:58.444 --> 01:12:00.844
Jolly good. Eight on the three.

01:12:00.947 --> 01:12:02.710
Put five on the five.

01:12:04.784 --> 01:12:07.014
All of the fives have gone, G.

01:12:10.323 --> 01:12:12.518
I think I'm too tired to play.

01:12:15.595 --> 01:12:17.859
- Gentlemen.
- Your Grace.

01:12:29.809 --> 01:12:31.140
Georgiana.

01:12:33.046 --> 01:12:34.707
No one must know.

01:12:36.115 --> 01:12:38.913
- You summoned Grey.
- Good night.

01:14:39.939 --> 01:14:42.407
I was thinking about going to Bath.

01:14:46.512 --> 01:14:53.008
Bess, you can stay here and look after
our husband whilst I take the cure.

01:14:54.821 --> 01:14:57.187
Yes, William. Why not?

01:14:57.290 --> 01:15:00.885
If G goes now, we can catch up with her
when you're free.

01:15:02.095 --> 01:15:03.790
Well, if you must.

01:15:16.876 --> 01:15:21.006
"The Duchess of Devonshire appeared
last week in Bath in a mobcap.

01:15:22.048 --> 01:15:25.279
"Her Grace, ever since initiation
into the business of electioneering,

01:15:25.385 --> 01:15:27.250
"has been much attached to the mobs."

01:15:27.353 --> 01:15:28.980
Very good.

01:15:32.692 --> 01:15:34.922
So which one is your favorite?

01:15:38.131 --> 01:15:40.326
- This one.
- Yeah.

01:15:42.568 --> 01:15:45.799
In this one it seems
you've hit a winning streak, for once.

01:15:45.905 --> 01:15:47.270
Very good.

01:15:50.076 --> 01:15:52.601
And in this one you see...

01:15:52.712 --> 01:15:56.512
Is that dress really an appropriate way
to attract voters?

01:15:56.616 --> 01:16:00.052
You politicians know absolutely nothing
about fashion.

01:16:01.554 --> 01:16:04.990
But if you were to really ask me
which my favorite was,

01:16:06.793 --> 01:16:08.761
I'd say it was this one.

01:16:23.376 --> 01:16:25.469
- Morning, Charles.
- Morning.

01:16:25.578 --> 01:16:27.011
Good day to you, sir.

01:16:52.672 --> 01:16:55.334
It's perfect. Thank you.

01:17:20.867 --> 01:17:23.233
Thought we would surprise you, G.

01:17:23.369 --> 01:17:26.202
I think you once said there wasn't
enough spontaneity in our marriage

01:17:26.305 --> 01:17:28.273
or words to that effect.

01:17:31.811 --> 01:17:34.041
Mama, what are you doing here?

01:17:35.681 --> 01:17:40.050
So, have you seen
many of our circle in Bath?

01:17:41.821 --> 01:17:42.947
Some.

01:17:44.257 --> 01:17:49.593
The Cokes and Haverford
and Lord Wicklow.

01:17:49.695 --> 01:17:53.222
Bunch of politicos, too, aren't there?
Meetings and such.

01:17:54.233 --> 01:17:55.222
I believe.

01:17:55.334 --> 01:17:59.771
Is Grey here?
By which I mean Mr. Charles Grey.

01:18:00.706 --> 01:18:02.833
Rumor has it that he is.

01:18:02.942 --> 01:18:04.671
- I won't give him up.
- Georgiana.

01:18:04.777 --> 01:18:07.940
Everyone has a lover.
Bess is the lover of my husband.

01:18:08.047 --> 01:18:09.708
If you had shown some discretion,

01:18:09.815 --> 01:18:12.215
- it might have been different.
- Different?

01:18:12.318 --> 01:18:14.752
The only good fortune is
it hasn't yet made it to the papers.

01:18:14.854 --> 01:18:18.688
My dear, Grey is unmarried.
He has no wealth, no rank.

01:18:18.791 --> 01:18:22.227
He risks nothing with this affair.
The hazard is all yours.

01:18:22.328 --> 01:18:25.161
- Grey loves me.
- So does William.

01:18:25.264 --> 01:18:28.665
Yes. I love you.

01:18:30.303 --> 01:18:31.531
How?

01:18:33.339 --> 01:18:35.933
In the way I understand love.

01:18:38.978 --> 01:18:43.677
Georgiana, this has gone much too far.
It is beneath our dignity.

01:18:43.783 --> 01:18:46.149
- All London is talking.
- Let them talk.

01:18:46.252 --> 01:18:48.777
If Grey makes me a fallen woman,
well and good.

01:18:48.888 --> 01:18:51.379
Now William may divorce me and
Bess becomes Duchess of Devonshire.

01:18:51.490 --> 01:18:53.355
That will never happen.

01:18:55.561 --> 01:18:57.893
I think I will leave you to it.

01:19:03.436 --> 01:19:05.631
What follows now?

01:19:05.738 --> 01:19:09.003
Are you going to tear my clothes off
and force yourself upon me again?

01:19:09.108 --> 01:19:11.303
Why on earth would I do that?

01:19:12.211 --> 01:19:17.478
I know that you've never thought much
of my manners or my intellect, G.

01:19:18.551 --> 01:19:22.715
But, in fact, I never do anything
that serves no purpose.

01:19:22.822 --> 01:19:25.689
I know precisely
what you two have together.

01:19:25.791 --> 01:19:27.622
- We love each other.
- I do not doubt it.

01:19:27.727 --> 01:19:29.422
He is a dreamer like yourself,

01:19:29.528 --> 01:19:34.124
and you both dream of another world
that does not exist and it never will.

01:19:34.233 --> 01:19:37.862
As for reality, allow me to enlighten you.

01:19:39.071 --> 01:19:42.871
If you do not give him up at once,
I will see to it

01:19:42.975 --> 01:19:47.435
that every home and every checkbook
in this country is closed to him.

01:19:47.546 --> 01:19:50.379
He will be welcomed
neither in the halls of government

01:19:50.483 --> 01:19:53.077
nor in its backrooms of power.

01:19:53.185 --> 01:19:55.983
His dream of becoming prime minister

01:19:56.122 --> 01:20:02.459
and your mutual fantasy
of a changed world will be dead as ash.

01:20:06.432 --> 01:20:09.299
And you will never
see your children again.

01:20:18.811 --> 01:20:20.142
Georgiana.

01:21:05.524 --> 01:21:07.856
I must ask you to return to London.

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:09.928
- Without you?
- Yes.

01:21:18.437 --> 01:21:20.837
These are from our girls.

01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:25.206
Little Hart neglected to write,
but then, of course, he's not yet one.

01:21:36.722 --> 01:21:40.681
- This will be the mistake of your life.
- No.

01:21:43.195 --> 01:21:45.322
I made that many years ago.

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.766
I trust you can see yourself out.

01:22:11.157 --> 01:22:13.990
- Damn you, man, open the door!
- Your Grace.

01:24:12.378 --> 01:24:15.370
Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama!

01:24:19.952 --> 01:24:21.715
Mama, Mama, Mama.

01:24:40.239 --> 01:24:43.572
- Come on, girls.
- Mama. I love you.

01:24:43.676 --> 01:24:47.476
Girls, run along.
Your mother will join you in a minute.

01:24:47.579 --> 01:24:48.807
Come on.

01:24:51.951 --> 01:24:53.282
Run along.

01:24:57.723 --> 01:24:58.747
G.

01:25:13.038 --> 01:25:14.801
You must know
how greatly pleased I am

01:25:14.907 --> 01:25:17.933
that we have come to an arrangement.

01:25:18.043 --> 01:25:22.139
It's not good for little ones
to be without their mother for so long.

01:25:22.247 --> 01:25:25.910
- My life for theirs.
- That's one way of putting it.

01:25:28.587 --> 01:25:32.614
Your mother called it "common decency
before personal gratification,"

01:25:32.725 --> 01:25:35.558
or some such thing.
The exact words escape me.

01:25:35.661 --> 01:25:39.358
How about
"imprisoned in my own house"?

01:25:42.067 --> 01:25:44.729
No. That's not how she put it.

01:25:46.672 --> 01:25:48.867
I would have remembered that.

01:26:13.432 --> 01:26:15.059
Georgiana!

01:26:15.167 --> 01:26:18.000
Unhand me!

01:26:18.103 --> 01:26:19.400
Georgiana!

01:26:23.175 --> 01:26:27.043
Georgiana! Will you please unhand me?

01:26:27.146 --> 01:26:28.477
Excuse me.

01:26:35.654 --> 01:26:38.214
Georgiana! Please.

01:26:39.925 --> 01:26:41.256
Georgiana!

01:26:42.828 --> 01:26:45.296
- Thank you, Burleigh.
- Let him go.

01:26:47.132 --> 01:26:52.832
I have written a dozen times a day.
Still, there is nothing from you.

01:26:52.938 --> 01:26:56.465
What has happened?
Do you love me no longer?

01:26:57.943 --> 01:27:02.380
- My personal feelings remain unaltered.
- Then we must be together again.

01:27:02.481 --> 01:27:05.075
I want to marry you.
I want you to bear my children.

01:27:05.184 --> 01:27:06.879
And I don't care if they're boys or girls!

01:27:06.985 --> 01:27:10.386
- I wish it could be that way.
- It can. It will.

01:27:11.623 --> 01:27:13.648
Sorrows will come
however we try to avoid them.

01:27:13.759 --> 01:27:15.989
We must stay the course
and never give in.

01:27:16.095 --> 01:27:18.859
- No, Charles.
- You must leave and be with me.

01:27:18.964 --> 01:27:21.125
A free woman. Now! Let us leave now!

01:27:21.233 --> 01:27:23.963
I cannot abandon my children.

01:27:27.239 --> 01:27:29.935
Listen to what you are asking me to do.

01:28:23.095 --> 01:28:26.587
What's the matter?
Don't like the pigeon?

01:28:28.967 --> 01:28:30.832
I find it quite decent.

01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:41.172
I'm carrying Charles Grey's child.

01:28:54.493 --> 01:28:58.088
Please be so kind as to inform
the Duchess of my decision.

01:29:00.132 --> 01:29:02.362
This is how it will be.

01:29:02.467 --> 01:29:06.403
You will be taken to the country
where you will give birth to the child,

01:29:06.505 --> 01:29:10.601
and the child will be trusted
to the care of Charles Grey's family.

01:29:14.746 --> 01:29:16.407
Are you listening?

01:29:17.416 --> 01:29:19.407
I think she's heard you. Let's leave her.

01:29:19.518 --> 01:29:21.509
- Georgiana, please.
- I said let's leave.

01:29:21.653 --> 01:29:24.053
This is not a discussion.
She's been informed of my decision.

01:29:24.156 --> 01:29:26.124
- Have pity on her, William.
- Pity be damned.

01:29:26.225 --> 01:29:28.557
She's brought this upon herself,
as well you know.

01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:31.652
- Now come.
- No. I will go with her.

01:29:32.764 --> 01:29:34.322
But you're not going anywhere.

01:29:34.433 --> 01:29:36.128
I will go with G, if G will have me,

01:29:36.235 --> 01:29:40.035
and there's nothing you can do or say
to stop either of us.

01:30:33.492 --> 01:30:37.087
- Thank you for coming.
- I couldn't not be with you.

01:31:14.666 --> 01:31:16.031
It's time.

01:31:20.339 --> 01:31:22.967
- Would it help...
- No, I must take her.

01:32:46.391 --> 01:32:49.690
Your Grace, I'm General Grey.

01:32:52.564 --> 01:32:54.122
Where's Charles?

01:32:55.033 --> 01:32:58.298
Your husband thought it best
if I took care of this.

01:33:36.074 --> 01:33:37.564
General Grey.

01:33:40.278 --> 01:33:41.939
Her name is Eliza.

01:33:53.959 --> 01:33:55.256
Come on.

01:34:06.705 --> 01:34:11.642
Come on, G. I've got you. I've got you.

01:35:37.329 --> 01:35:40.890
I'm not particularly adept
at expressing myself

01:35:40.999 --> 01:35:44.765
when it comes to matters
of a more personal nature.

01:35:47.606 --> 01:35:49.198
But I shall try.

01:35:52.210 --> 01:35:55.077
Over the years, I have acted in ways

01:35:55.180 --> 01:35:59.446
that you have judged to be harsh.

01:36:03.521 --> 01:36:06.957
Well, I do not wish for you
to undergo any further suffering.

01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:15.092
In fact, I would like our lives
to find a calm normality.

01:36:24.909 --> 01:36:27.070
Lady Melbourne has arranged
a small gathering

01:36:27.178 --> 01:36:30.511
in honor of your recent return
from holiday.

01:36:30.649 --> 01:36:34.210
And given some of the vague reports
that have been circulating this past year

01:36:34.352 --> 01:36:36.980
I think it would be wise for us to go.

01:36:38.890 --> 01:36:41.120
A show of unity, so to speak.

01:36:44.963 --> 01:36:46.590
Who will be there?

01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:50.231
Everybody.

01:37:01.379 --> 01:37:02.744
As you wish.

01:37:48.326 --> 01:37:50.556
How wonderful to be that free.

01:38:07.245 --> 01:38:08.610
Come here.

01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:20.286
Come here. Little G, come here.

01:38:34.739 --> 01:38:38.732
The Duke and Duchess of Devonshire
and Lady Elizabeth Foster.

01:38:51.923 --> 01:38:53.254
- Your Grace.
- It's lovely to see you.

01:38:53.358 --> 01:38:55.349
Welcome back, Your Grace.

01:38:58.763 --> 01:39:00.094
Excuse me.

01:39:00.932 --> 01:39:04.197
- Welcome back.
- Welcome home, Your Grace.

01:39:04.302 --> 01:39:07.203
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back, G.

01:39:07.305 --> 01:39:09.865
Your presence has been sorely missed.

01:39:49.848 --> 01:39:51.577
Would you excuse me?

01:39:55.119 --> 01:39:57.587
- Mr. Grey.
- Your Grace.

01:40:00.992 --> 01:40:03.290
I trust your tour was enjoyable.

01:40:04.863 --> 01:40:06.387
Yes.

01:40:06.497 --> 01:40:10.365
We spent the summer in Switzerland
and the winter in Nice.

01:40:10.468 --> 01:40:12.561
Well, I speak on behalf of everybody

01:40:12.670 --> 01:40:16.572
when I say how glad I am
that you have arrived home safely.

01:40:20.945 --> 01:40:23.140
And what news with you?

01:40:25.450 --> 01:40:27.111
I'm to be engaged.

01:40:30.054 --> 01:40:31.715
To Lady Ponsonby.

01:40:33.625 --> 01:40:36.185
The announcement will follow shortly.

01:40:37.829 --> 01:40:39.524
Congratulations.

01:40:42.901 --> 01:40:46.632
And I have a niece, Eliza,

01:40:50.008 --> 01:40:51.908
who is very much loved.

01:41:00.318 --> 01:41:02.809
One day you should come
and meet her,

01:41:04.055 --> 01:41:05.716
in a little while.

01:41:07.859 --> 01:41:09.520
If you would like.

01:41:12.497 --> 01:41:14.624
I would like that very much.

01:42:38.983 --> 01:42:40.917
Who's going to catch me first?

01:42:44.422 --> 01:42:45.946
- Me!
- Quick, girls.

01:42:46.057 --> 01:42:49.026
Quick, I'm going to get away!

01:42:49.127 --> 01:42:54.190
Come on, girls, keep running.

01:43:04.108 --> 01:43:06.906
And I love you, and I love you.

01:47:06.907 --> 01:47:07.909
