00:01.044 --> 00:03.513
Previously on Spotless...

00:06.745 --> 00:08.824
- Why is he here?
- I've got a little problem.

00:10.100 --> 00:12.904
You brought drug from France
inside a girl's corpse?

00:13.194 --> 00:14.082
That's what they say.

00:14.114 --> 00:16.929
But why would I give them their
drugs back with all they owe me?

00:16.930 --> 00:18.090
We found him.

00:20.230 --> 00:21.399
I'm under investigation.

00:21.519 --> 00:23.830
- What?
- I know a lot of stuff, John.

00:24.090 --> 00:25.835
Damaging information.

00:26.150 --> 00:28.483
Life's for fucking living.

00:28.603 --> 00:30.297
Drag your tools out of storage,

00:30.310 --> 00:33.030
and make wonderful things.

00:34.849 --> 00:39.162
I don't see how I could let
such a talent, slip by me.

00:39.388 --> 00:40.943
I'm not who you think I am.

00:40.988 --> 00:42.289
I think you are.

00:42.315 --> 00:44.180
But you don't know yet.

00:44.300 --> 00:45.708
My brother's my partner.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.152
OK.

00:47.197 --> 00:49.172
You said 6, but I only see 5.

00:49.205 --> 00:50.889
Look at the bottom.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.784
This could kill you.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.208
- Where is it?
- I flushed it down the toilet.

00:56.076 --> 00:58.006
I believe you know

00:58.588 --> 01:00.771

02:32.865 --> 02:34.787
I believe you know

02:34.907 --> 02:37.400
DCI Tom Kendrick.

03:07.023 --> 03:08.600
Barely knew the man.

03:08.632 --> 03:10.565
You frequently bribed him,

03:10.960 --> 03:15.918
with envelopes of cash,
ranging from Â£1500 to 3 grand.

03:18.033 --> 03:21.948
He put work your way, and
preferred better status.

03:22.333 --> 03:24.508
You gave him one such envelope

03:24.628 --> 03:26.289
a few days ago.

03:26.592 --> 03:29.223
What? You killed him
because he took my bribe?

03:29.233 --> 03:31.240
He took bribes from me too,

03:31.480 --> 03:33.816
countless dozen others that I know.

03:35.001 --> 03:36.660
With his investigation,

03:36.680 --> 03:38.411
and with his suspension...

03:40.676 --> 03:42.922
I acted in the common interest.

03:47.440 --> 03:50.044
Well, I think the word you're
looking for is "thank you".

03:50.080 --> 03:52.361
First of all, that's two words, mate.

03:53.281 --> 03:55.709
And you, don't touch anything,
'cause that's a setup.

03:56.440 --> 03:57.749
If we remove this dead cop,

03:57.781 --> 04:00.300
from his fucking dead cop
house, they will hunt us down.

04:00.475 --> 04:02.365
- No one would know.
- Yeah, you would know.

04:02.800 --> 04:03.868
He would know.

04:04.263 --> 04:05.817
Him, and him.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.258
I don't want the body removed.

04:08.303 --> 04:10.226
That would draw attention.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.063
I want you

04:13.419 --> 04:15.368
to make it look like suicide.

04:16.139 --> 04:17.091
What?

04:19.274 --> 04:20.620
Is it possible?

04:23.160 --> 04:26.440
I... I would like to have a word
with my brother, right now, please.

04:32.165 --> 04:33.703
Nobody touches anything.

04:35.292 --> 04:36.547
Can you do it?

04:36.589 --> 04:37.657
I don't know.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.357
- Maybe.
- How?

04:39.477 --> 04:41.635
Dead bodies is not your thing, you said it!

04:41.680 --> 04:43.915
You know, I... I sit down
in post-mortems sometimes

04:43.922 --> 04:45.256
every couple months.

04:45.735 --> 04:47.280
Well, if I know these things,

04:47.400 --> 04:50.002
I can read a scene, I can
do a better job cleaning it.

04:50.482 --> 04:53.058
- Your job is pretty fucking creepy.
- Yeah, no shit.

04:53.080 --> 04:54.480
And you pay bribes?

04:54.677 --> 04:56.173
Yeah, that's how it works.

04:56.711 --> 04:57.720
Who do you bribe?

04:57.960 --> 05:00.680
Cops, paramedics, counselor officers,

05:00.738 --> 05:02.240
concierges at hotels.

05:02.360 --> 05:05.173
500, 200, 20, 50... whatever it takes.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.481
That's business.

05:10.147 --> 05:12.083
I never thought you'd
do something like that.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.960
I would, but not you.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.780
Time is getting on, ladies.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.623
Is this the best time to talk about it?

05:20.390 --> 05:22.580
JULIE: Where are you?

05:22.990 --> 05:23.967
Fuck.

05:24.960 --> 05:27.380
It's Maddy's school interview today.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.226
I gotta be there.

05:31.490 --> 05:32.606
Who shot him?

05:33.358 --> 05:34.245
I did.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.621
It was, uh, Joey's gun though.

05:36.680 --> 05:37.760
OK, show me.

05:55.102 --> 05:56.488
Just calm down.

05:56.495 --> 05:59.110
OK. Be the victim. Stand where he was.

06:12.462 --> 06:15.739
The barrel was in his mouth when
you pulled the... the trigger?

06:15.920 --> 06:17.630
We were trying to scare him.

06:19.287 --> 06:20.951
He refused to be scared.

06:21.877 --> 06:23.760
- He hit you?
- Yeah.

06:23.880 --> 06:26.048
Uh, it was a bit of a
scuffle, it was nothing.

06:27.039 --> 06:30.190
- There's no bleeding.
- It's a tissue for your nose.

06:50.427 --> 06:51.873
I need everybody off the property.

06:51.915 --> 06:54.076
What? No. No chance, mate.

06:54.451 --> 06:57.148
If there's the smallest
suggestion this wasn't suicide,

06:57.160 --> 06:59.571
they're gonna trace every print, hair,

06:59.607 --> 07:01.405
bead of sweat on the carpet.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.364
I need space to work.

07:05.280 --> 07:06.830
Joey stays.

07:11.901 --> 07:13.258
Stay vigilant.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.875
The wife is with her family
down in the South Coast,

07:15.881 --> 07:17.193
- she'll be back tonight.
- OK.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.683
Look at the fucking state of
you. What have you been taking?

07:28.720 --> 07:29.653
What?

07:32.041 --> 07:34.214
If you come in to work
like that again, he will

07:34.274 --> 07:35.565
notice.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.274
Tell you what,

07:37.680 --> 07:38.762
fuck him.

07:40.320 --> 07:41.309
Do you need me?

07:42.524 --> 07:43.387
Yeah.

07:43.988 --> 07:45.458
What, you got a pressing appointment?

07:45.810 --> 07:47.804
What, do you need me to
hold your hand or something?

07:50.972 --> 07:51.830
Yes.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.544
Don't worry, they're not gonna kill you.

07:55.381 --> 07:58.376
They think you're like
fucking crime scenes' Picasso.

08:01.477 --> 08:03.906
more useful to found out about them.

08:04.682 --> 08:05.611
Why?

08:06.040 --> 08:09.389
"Know your opponent", The Art
of War, Sun Tzu, chapter 3.

08:09.440 --> 08:12.253
-  What the fuck you're talking about?
- I'm talking about what I bring to the table.

08:13.756 --> 08:15.739
- She doesn't give up.
- JULIE: You better be on your way!

08:15.760 --> 08:18.442
- No, she doesn't.
- It's about Maddy?

08:18.734 --> 08:19.514
Yeah.

08:24.480 --> 08:25.974
Well, I'm gonna go to war.

08:30.707 --> 08:32.481
- May I step
out?- Hm-mm.

08:37.846 --> 08:38.947
You trust these boys?

08:38.977 --> 08:40.760
Time will tell, Victor.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.346
Time will tell.

08:45.945 --> 08:46.987
Hey guys,

08:47.616 --> 08:49.080
my brother doesn't need me.

08:49.128 --> 08:50.551
Do you wanna go get a drink?

08:51.520 --> 08:52.432
A drink?

08:53.216 --> 08:54.506
It's 7 in the morning.

08:54.545 --> 08:55.950
That wasn't my question.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.216
Be smart.

09:02.541 --> 09:03.866
Yeah, all right.

09:05.129 --> 09:06.917
I know a fantastic little spot.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.160
That's your car?

09:08.280 --> 09:10.132
This, is my car.

09:22.992 --> 09:24.320
Jesus Christ!

09:24.326 --> 09:26.153
Fat bastard!

09:28.466 --> 09:29.917
No, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

09:31.054 --> 09:32.802
- We shake him.
- What?

09:32.991 --> 09:35.444
- We shake him side to side.
- Why?

09:35.491 --> 09:37.703
We can still move the
blood around the body.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.542
We don't want a pathologist
wondering how come all the blood

09:40.581 --> 09:42.259
is pooled on the right hand side.

09:42.848 --> 09:43.720
Come on!

09:47.227 --> 09:48.845
You're pretty sick, you know that?

10:27.353 --> 10:28.664
Are you calling Dad?

10:30.420 --> 10:31.543
Is he at work?

10:32.403 --> 10:33.200
Yep.

10:33.526 --> 10:35.063
But he's not picking up?

10:37.422 --> 10:39.823
He'll do what he always
does, promise to be there

10:39.825 --> 10:41.750
and promise again, and not show up,

10:41.763 --> 10:43.337
because work gets in the way.

10:43.776 --> 10:46.150
Work is God in this family.

10:46.737 --> 10:48.023
Hey, he'll be there.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.670
That was the last thing he
said before he left for work,

10:50.930 --> 10:53.249
to earn money, to pay for
everything that you eat,

10:53.280 --> 10:55.240
and wear and shelter beneath.

10:55.360 --> 10:56.461
Sure he will.

10:57.327 --> 10:58.965
I'm not loving the cynism, Maddy.

10:58.977 --> 11:00.646
Stick with hypocrisy, Mom.

11:08.903 --> 11:10.020
Wait, wait, wait.

11:13.784 --> 11:15.377
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.627
Gimme his gun.

11:28.726 --> 11:29.830
OK.

11:36.520 --> 11:37.754
Grab his head.

11:43.325 --> 11:46.299
So, why are we shooting
a dead guy in the head?

11:46.719 --> 11:47.835
Again?

11:48.808 --> 11:51.167
Well, the blood splatter
is a little high, but,

11:51.895 --> 11:53.281
but if we get our angles right,

11:53.287 --> 11:55.345
it's gonna make sense that
he shot himself at his desk.

11:57.228 --> 11:59.875
Then why don't we just shoot
straight into the fucking wall?

12:00.842 --> 12:03.916
The bullet has to pass
through the existing hole.

12:04.392 --> 12:07.720
This is a larger caliber
weapon than the one Frank used.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.484
It's gonna create a larger exit wound.

12:10.791 --> 12:12.223
That's what's gonna sell it.

12:13.376 --> 12:15.051
- Get it?
- Yeah.

12:15.080 --> 12:17.440
- Any more questions?
- No, I'm done.

12:17.478 --> 12:18.492
Good.

12:27.646 --> 12:28.790
OK.

12:33.882 --> 12:36.636
I've actually never fired a gun before.

12:37.649 --> 12:39.575
I'm just a regular guy, you know?

12:40.124 --> 12:41.733
Yeah, I can see that.

12:46.477 --> 12:48.561
- You ready?
- Yeah.

12:52.087 --> 12:52.960
One...

12:54.812 --> 12:56.040
two...

12:57.966 --> 12:59.035
three.

13:10.393 --> 13:12.132
It was the hardest part.

13:15.220 --> 13:16.708
I did two tours,

13:16.727 --> 13:17.927
Rwanda,

13:18.308 --> 13:19.434
Somalia.

13:19.434 --> 13:21.843
I saw death, and waste,

13:22.122 --> 13:23.387
genocide.

13:24.215 --> 13:28.177
The worst humanitarian
crisis in our generation.

13:30.372 --> 13:32.047
And I never talk about it.

13:34.307 --> 13:36.000
- What unit?
- Montfort.

13:36.037 --> 13:38.921
Special Forces. '95 to '05.

13:42.409 --> 13:43.990
You're full of shit.

13:46.995 --> 13:48.200
Drink.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.828
You were never in the army.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.033
I don't believe in borders.

13:54.070 --> 13:57.065
What the fuck would I be in the army for?

13:59.131 --> 14:00.638
Leave the bottle.

14:04.639 --> 14:05.960
Your turn.

14:11.699 --> 14:13.200
I am...

14:13.783 --> 14:15.020
a widower.

14:17.187 --> 14:20.973
My beautiful amazing wife
died nearly five years ago.

14:22.573 --> 14:23.960
Innocently.

14:25.931 --> 14:27.363
Undeservedly.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.275
I'm sorry.

14:42.898 --> 14:46.842
- I've never seen anyone drink scotch like that.
- It's not scotch.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.040
Whisky.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.480
Single malt.

14:50.396 --> 14:51.829
I hate the taste.

14:52.126 --> 14:53.680
Love the impact.

14:55.763 --> 14:58.954
- Are you a bad drunk?
- Oh, I am terrible.

14:59.372 --> 15:01.493
There is no telling what I might do.

15:02.005 --> 15:03.240
Liar.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.331
Drink.

15:12.367 --> 15:14.609
What were you doing
before you came to London?

15:15.160 --> 15:18.665
- I worked in Saint-Nazaire for
some guys.- More than just drugs?

15:18.693 --> 15:21.902
Anything that comes off
and on a boat in a harbor.

15:22.627 --> 15:23.688
From where?

15:24.116 --> 15:25.480
Africa.

15:26.153 --> 15:27.560
And sometimes...

15:28.488 --> 15:29.939
South America.

15:34.190 --> 15:35.400
Fuck.

15:50.711 --> 15:52.311
You guys just wasted

15:52.330 --> 15:54.107
a pretty senior cop.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.480
And it doesn't seem to affect you.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.110
Are you protected?

16:00.618 --> 16:02.451
We are like the banks.

16:02.479 --> 16:04.880
Mate, we are too big to fail.

16:06.684 --> 16:07.920
Property,

16:08.191 --> 16:10.256
security, narcotics,

16:10.265 --> 16:11.772
import-export...

16:12.070 --> 16:13.577
The day we go under,

16:13.931 --> 16:16.814
half the men will have to
sell their holiday homes.

16:23.047 --> 16:25.233
Nobody's too big to fail.

16:33.520 --> 16:34.800
All right, my turn.

16:34.920 --> 16:38.067
- Your brother, he's different than you.
- Yeah.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.320
I'm cooler than he is.

16:40.364 --> 16:43.099
- You get on?
- Like brothers.

16:43.518 --> 16:44.950
Does he ever

16:45.499 --> 16:47.760
humiliate you in front of other people?

16:47.880 --> 16:49.240
Not really.

16:50.837 --> 16:52.940
You hate your brother.

16:53.060 --> 16:54.540
No, I love my brother.

16:56.558 --> 16:59.280
It's all the other fucking
cunts I can't stand.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.460
They hush when I walk into a room,

17:01.479 --> 17:03.630
they laugh behind my back when I leave.

17:04.679 --> 17:06.630
- Fuck them cunts.
- Yeah, I will man.

17:06.651 --> 17:09.960
One day, I'm gonna do some real
fucking damage, you know mate.

17:47.774 --> 17:50.937
Every door and doorframe, clean.

17:51.570 --> 17:52.602
Good.

17:53.831 --> 17:57.400
Do you... want me to dry the
rug with that blower thing.

17:57.924 --> 18:00.445
No, central heating will dry the rug.

18:00.640 --> 18:03.422
And speed up decomposition of the body,

18:03.720 --> 18:05.312
which is gonna lead them

18:05.680 --> 18:07.139
to the right conclusion.

18:14.739 --> 18:16.515
Two exams on Friday

18:16.635 --> 18:19.320
and my dissertation is
due in a week on Monday.

18:19.440 --> 18:20.640
What's it about?

18:20.760 --> 18:23.302
"Do complementary therapies
have any role to play

18:23.330 --> 18:25.800
in the management of
third trimester pregnancy?"

18:25.814 --> 18:27.209
Do they?

18:27.329 --> 18:29.665
Nurses are pretty sexy.

18:30.548 --> 18:32.185
You'll be a good nurse.

18:33.013 --> 18:35.097
You are creepy, you know that?

18:35.217 --> 18:37.200
Arrestable.

18:37.320 --> 18:38.800
I walk the line.

18:39.962 --> 18:41.360
My man!

18:42.874 --> 18:44.278
Have you been drinkin'?

18:44.398 --> 18:46.176
You're not the boss of me.

18:51.757 --> 18:53.664
- What was that for?
- Because.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.525
And I want me pen back.

18:58.530 --> 19:01.190
- Hello, Clear Sky.
- Hey, Maureen.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.976
It's me. Is he there?

19:03.440 --> 19:05.350
No, uh, he's still not back.

19:05.385 --> 19:08.046
- Well, he's been gone since 3.
- We've got

19:08.334 --> 19:11.116
4 jobs on the heat, it
could be any of them.

19:13.469 --> 19:14.790
Nothing.

19:16.027 --> 19:18.910
Middle of the night, one of
the vans clocked out at 3.15am.

19:18.920 --> 19:21.701
- Well, Maddy's interview's at 11.
- I know, how's she doing?

19:21.821 --> 19:22.854
Same as always.

19:22.855 --> 19:25.702
- Not giving anything away.
- She's a brilliant kid, Julie, she'll be fine.

19:25.720 --> 19:28.911
- Maureen, he has to be there.
- I'm sure he will be.

19:30.102 --> 19:33.041
- I'll send him another reminder. Thanks.
- Bye.

19:36.480 --> 19:37.998
Pants on fire.

19:40.918 --> 19:44.025
- I'd buy it.
- Well, let's hope they do.

19:44.835 --> 19:48.240
- JULIE: I'm on way. Meet me at the school.
- Ah, shit. I gotta go.

19:48.360 --> 19:49.850
I don't think so.

19:50.320 --> 19:53.236
It's a family think. It's my daughter, it's important.
- Mr. Clay,

19:53.273 --> 19:54.800
wants to see you.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.040
Well, I don't care. Not now.

19:59.003 --> 20:01.542
It wasn't a fucking request!

20:01.560 --> 20:03.264
Now imagine how strang it would seem

20:03.291 --> 20:05.640
to clean your own blood off this rug.

20:07.180 --> 20:08.800
I'll see you outside.

20:30.341 --> 20:31.903
I hate London.

20:33.475 --> 20:35.080
It's a shithole.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.160
I love it!

20:41.977 --> 20:43.336
Hey, it's me.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.950
I'm finished with the battle.

20:46.676 --> 20:48.267
I think I won.

20:49.429 --> 20:52.360
Uh, just wanted to know
how you were in the field.

20:52.564 --> 20:54.555
And I hope everything's OK.

20:55.531 --> 20:56.920
Call me back.

21:26.516 --> 21:28.451
I'll give you 9 and 10.

21:32.367 --> 21:35.260
- How long?
- One week, maybe longer. I'll let you know.

21:55.316 --> 21:56.920
Leave the phone.

22:13.279 --> 22:14.680
Over there.

22:15.139 --> 22:16.730
Towards the bushes.

22:19.010 --> 22:20.107
Go.

22:21.689 --> 22:22.982
Walk.

23:46.776 --> 23:49.167
You can go, Denny, thanks.

24:02.042 --> 24:04.126
This is not what I expected.

24:04.769 --> 24:06.015
Yeah?

24:08.945 --> 24:10.600
What d'you have in mind?

24:12.499 --> 24:14.600
Severed horses' heads?

24:18.238 --> 24:21.177
Fistful of sovereign rings on my fingers?

24:21.689 --> 24:24.843
Pictures of my granny surviving the Blitz?

24:26.210 --> 24:28.360
I'm not the type, my friend.

24:35.938 --> 24:39.640
Silver tip white tea from
South China. Don't need milk.

24:54.096 --> 24:56.673
Don't you have someone
who can do this for you?

25:02.720 --> 25:07.200
I've got purple sprouting broccoli
over there. I got sprouts, kale,

25:07.320 --> 25:10.105
fresh wet and wild garlic,

25:10.459 --> 25:13.129
It tastes like nothing else,
because it's grown here.

25:13.575 --> 25:15.966
I got peas, peppers, runners.

25:16.766 --> 25:18.360
Apple tree.

25:19.017 --> 25:21.160
Goosegogs down the end.

25:24.952 --> 25:26.887
I've got a beautiful house,

25:27.120 --> 25:29.306
land and stables.

25:32.180 --> 25:34.989
But this is my place.

25:37.696 --> 25:38.961
You understand?

25:39.761 --> 25:41.072
Yeah.

25:44.487 --> 25:46.040
Walk with me.

26:04.878 --> 26:07.426
Emma can show Madeleine around for a bit.

26:07.696 --> 26:09.840
It's a nice day, perhaps
take in the grounds too.

26:09.882 --> 26:11.280
30 minutes?

26:11.400 --> 26:13.193
Better make it 45.

26:13.965 --> 26:15.360
Have fun.

26:17.733 --> 26:20.346
Sorry. I'm... I'm sure my
husband will be here any minute.

26:29.416 --> 26:32.179
I saw you noticed young Frank this morning.

26:33.601 --> 26:36.234
Fucking cocaine, and pills.

26:37.936 --> 26:39.880
His judgement is off.

26:41.667 --> 26:44.532
And I believe he is selling very sensitive,

26:44.541 --> 26:47.680
very commercial information
to another group.

26:48.234 --> 26:50.876
Turkish crew, very...

26:53.099 --> 26:55.453
rough types.

26:58.727 --> 27:00.550
What should I do with him?

27:02.699 --> 27:05.720
- Why are you telling me this?
- I'm interested in your opinion.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.843
You have a natural sense of justice.

27:07.880 --> 27:10.640
You know what's right and
what's wrong. I understand that.

27:10.655 --> 27:13.150
No, I don't think about these things.

27:16.110 --> 27:18.514
Let me tell you about my first wife.

27:19.161 --> 27:21.160
Maggie. She was the most

27:21.185 --> 27:23.600
good woman that I ever met.

27:23.840 --> 27:25.531
And after she passed away, I became

27:25.553 --> 27:28.840
very concerned about what I was...

27:29.832 --> 27:32.670
gonna do to other people,
what I was capable of.

27:33.114 --> 27:34.758
Then I met Sonny.

27:35.440 --> 27:38.360
Now, she, is a force of nature.

27:39.561 --> 27:42.193
She lives life on her own terms. Very

27:42.313 --> 27:45.280
powerful woman. And I learned from her.

27:46.316 --> 27:47.924
What did you learn?

27:48.126 --> 27:52.092
Not to be afraid of what I was
capable of. And I think that you

27:52.293 --> 27:54.264
need to learn that too.

27:59.295 --> 28:00.717
Why am I here?

28:01.729 --> 28:04.125
We killed a man last night.

28:05.174 --> 28:07.682
And you're a part of that,
whether you like or not.

28:07.905 --> 28:09.342
And I want you to understand

28:09.360 --> 28:12.943
that any sense of badness or guilt

28:13.000 --> 28:15.160
is a fucking waste of energy.

28:19.530 --> 28:21.955
What I feel or think about these things,

28:22.557 --> 28:24.254
that's my business.

28:28.660 --> 28:30.513
Your tea tastes like shit.

28:47.480 --> 28:48.492
Hey, Jean?

28:50.427 --> 28:52.399
This is my place.

28:53.080 --> 28:54.110
What's yours?

28:55.060 --> 28:56.995
It's not so much a place,

28:58.031 --> 28:59.720
more a circumstance.

29:16.441 --> 29:18.543
What's going to happen to him?

29:19.473 --> 29:22.589
Mussels will eat him. He can fuck off.

29:23.278 --> 29:25.566
We're gonna go to jail.

29:28.301 --> 29:31.371
If someone learns of this,
we'll rot in a dungeon,

29:31.390 --> 29:33.818
forever. With rats, scorpios,

29:33.836 --> 29:37.394
- And rotten meat to eat! You got it, now?
- Yes, I do.

29:39.254 --> 29:40.463
Come on.

29:49.244 --> 29:52.267
You understand that we
have an ethos at Kings Gate.

29:52.280 --> 29:56.000
That school years are about
more than just passing exams.

29:56.007 --> 29:58.425
That's why we insit on commitment from

29:58.720 --> 30:00.760
- the whole family.
- Of course.

30:00.880 --> 30:03.574
Not that we're passing
judgement on single parents.

30:03.627 --> 30:06.640
I mean, after all, this
is the 21st century.

30:07.413 --> 30:09.854
Actually, Mrs BastiÃ¨re, you... I'm sorry,

30:09.884 --> 30:11.520
you're not a single parent, are you?

30:11.543 --> 30:13.151
Mr. BastiÃ¨re.

30:13.374 --> 30:14.438
Thank you, Dee.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.246
Madam.

30:16.574 --> 30:18.181
I do apologize.

30:18.301 --> 30:21.200
It has been a bitch of a morning.

30:22.530 --> 30:25.422
Well, I'm just glad you
finally made it, Mr. BastiÃ¨re.

30:25.440 --> 30:29.165
In truth, there wouldn't have
been much point continuing without

30:29.285 --> 30:30.676
- the two of you.
- Oh, no,

30:30.683 --> 30:33.117
- sorry, he's not..
- Usually that busy, but

30:33.146 --> 30:35.520
but I like to make myself
available for the kids.

30:35.640 --> 30:37.360
And Julie, of course.

30:37.680 --> 30:39.413
We're a very close family.

30:39.440 --> 30:40.932
We've been together for

30:40.961 --> 30:42.599
- twelve years now.
- Yes, fifteen.

30:42.719 --> 30:44.120
... teen years now.

30:44.474 --> 30:46.640
And, all we care about is the kids.

30:46.669 --> 30:50.070
- So Mr. BastiÃ¨re, you are...
- French, yeah.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.146
And I do reassure you I

30:52.190 --> 30:54.683
shower more than once a week.

30:56.552 --> 31:00.317
Well, what I was going to say, you're
a director of your own company...

31:00.360 --> 31:02.275
- I am, uh, aren't I?
- Yes.

31:02.312 --> 31:03.532
Yeah.

31:05.073 --> 31:07.685
Yes, uh, Jean started out

31:07.692 --> 31:10.260
when I was pregnant
with Maddie. It was just

31:10.513 --> 31:12.537
him and an old Ford Transit.

31:12.560 --> 31:16.488
But now he has twelve full-time
staff, and twenty or so occasional,

31:16.520 --> 31:20.702
- a fleet of vehicles.
- I have, uh, achieved a lot.

31:21.827 --> 31:23.139
Hmm.

31:39.658 --> 31:41.426
Hey, it's me.

31:42.720 --> 31:44.598
I'm sorry I couldn't get away.

31:46.049 --> 31:47.723
Are you in the middle of it?

31:48.449 --> 31:49.920
Did you delay?

31:50.226 --> 31:51.560
Should I come?

31:54.375 --> 31:55.789
I'm sorry.

32:03.590 --> 32:06.325
- Hey.
- You look terrible.

32:06.697 --> 32:07.962
What have we got?

32:07.981 --> 32:10.920
Um, five crews out, three straightforward:

32:10.960 --> 32:14.880
hotel room, inside of train
carriage, school spillage.

32:14.902 --> 32:17.806
High rise, low nothing
dirty protest/suicide

32:17.807 --> 32:19.310
at Wormwood Scrubs, are our bigger jobs.

32:19.739 --> 32:24.074
- Why is the prison a bigger job?
- Venue, did it in the canteen.

32:24.320 --> 32:26.707
Two on backup to be
confirmed, nothing major.

32:26.720 --> 32:29.190
- I gotta rest my head.
- Anything I should know?

32:29.310 --> 32:30.149
No.

32:30.269 --> 32:32.632
- Oh, and your wife called.
- I got it.

33:17.461 --> 33:20.160
There's your copy and your receipt.

33:20.280 --> 33:23.079
Just pull when you get to the
barrier, and I'll raise it for you.

33:23.120 --> 33:24.754
Fucking thieves.

33:31.757 --> 33:34.586
- Anything?
- Nothing, just his personnal shit.

33:34.600 --> 33:38.031
His board, dirty clothes,
fucking books, nothing.

33:38.418 --> 33:39.440
What now?

33:39.560 --> 33:40.859
We need wheels.

33:40.979 --> 33:42.228
We're not going to use this?

33:42.235 --> 33:45.950
Maybe you want to hang a tricolore out the
window, wear a bÃ©ret, eat a fucking baguette?

33:46.120 --> 33:47.920
We're supposed to be inconspicuous.

33:48.040 --> 33:50.213
You don't think there's a
chance he recognizes the van?

33:50.228 --> 33:51.969
OK, OK, I love car-jacking!

33:52.089 --> 33:53.880
We used to do it on weekends, for fun.

33:53.896 --> 33:55.240
What do you wanna drive?

33:57.086 --> 34:00.174
One of their faggot
car these faggots drive.

34:02.342 --> 34:04.863
Perception is everything.

34:05.587 --> 34:08.520
She lost her family, her home,

34:08.639 --> 34:10.000
her cat.

34:10.880 --> 34:12.518
Wrongly convicted.

34:12.918 --> 34:14.610
It was pretty tragic.

34:15.532 --> 34:17.234
We cleared the scene.

34:17.877 --> 34:21.141
And a new family moved
in, the following month.

34:21.868 --> 34:24.560
That is... it's fascinating.

34:24.679 --> 34:27.235
I know, but, it's just a job.

34:27.254 --> 34:29.688
Oh, I... I think we can
forgive him the occasional

34:29.694 --> 34:31.813
"bitch of a morning", don't you?

34:34.290 --> 34:37.172
But don't get me wrong,
it is usually, very dull.

34:37.178 --> 34:38.344
I find that very

34:38.360 --> 34:40.405
very unlikely.

34:42.257 --> 34:44.156
Look, just give me a minute,

34:44.400 --> 34:48.091
- I'd like to take you on the tour personnally.
- Oh, lovely.

34:48.145 --> 34:49.002
Thank you.

34:49.830 --> 34:51.920
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

34:56.056 --> 34:58.120
Oh, can I please ask
what the fuck is going on?

34:58.240 --> 35:00.558
Jean is stuck at work.

35:00.855 --> 35:03.079
But this is really important for him.

35:03.116 --> 35:05.680
- He asked you to come?
- No.

35:06.040 --> 35:09.452
I went to the house, you weren't there. I
tried to warn you so you could delay this.

35:09.920 --> 35:10.959
So I came.

35:11.240 --> 35:12.415
That's Jean's.

35:12.535 --> 35:15.215
Yeah, I don't own that kind of clothes.

35:15.335 --> 35:17.839
I thought I should look smart for Maddy.

35:19.858 --> 35:21.300
Looks good.

35:23.159 --> 35:26.240
Mr. and Mrs BastiÃ¨re, when you're ready.

35:26.920 --> 35:28.840
I think this is going very well.

35:28.843 --> 35:30.927
You can take your hand off my ass now.

35:31.280 --> 35:32.470
Of course.

35:39.281 --> 35:40.750
Mom?

35:41.662 --> 35:43.383
Get out!

35:46.081 --> 35:47.774
Get out!

35:48.472 --> 35:50.965
Get out!!

35:58.630 --> 35:59.765
Claire?

36:00.928 --> 36:02.426
Do you want to meet up?

36:04.687 --> 36:06.491
When can you get free?

36:07.800 --> 36:11.338
We'll keep Maddy with us
for another half-hour or so,

36:11.579 --> 36:14.416
let her sit in on a course with her peers.

36:15.095 --> 36:17.365
If you wouldn't mind
waiting in the great hall.

36:18.798 --> 36:20.760
That's wonderful.

36:20.880 --> 36:23.403
Jean and I are so grateful
for your time. Thank you.

36:23.440 --> 36:25.794
- Not at all.
- Madam.

36:29.170 --> 36:32.008
- Again there, hand off the ass.
- Sorry.

36:50.107 --> 36:53.186
Maybe he lives in another street,
and just parked the van here.

36:53.502 --> 36:54.888
If he did,

36:55.008 --> 36:57.232
it'll be a long week.

37:03.259 --> 37:04.757
Nice houses.

37:05.055 --> 37:07.259
Squats and crackhouses.

37:07.960 --> 37:10.348
Hundred years ago, they
were all merchants' homes.

37:10.468 --> 37:13.715
Now most of them are broken
up into apartments, or bedsits.

37:13.835 --> 37:16.432
- 10, 12 bedrooms in each house.
- Bullshit.

37:16.469 --> 37:18.181
There's no crackhouses here.

37:18.301 --> 37:21.720
- This is a nice place.
- Don't contradict me.

37:22.228 --> 37:23.720
I know stuff.

37:28.182 --> 37:29.912
He's around here.

37:31.345 --> 37:33.000
Some place.

37:33.661 --> 37:35.240
Close.

37:36.042 --> 37:37.717
I can smell him.

37:38.907 --> 37:40.749
Fucking his whore.

37:41.103 --> 37:43.010
Spending our money.

37:43.820 --> 37:46.390
You think, people fuck
the same way in England?

37:46.396 --> 37:49.271
- How would they fuck different?
- I don't know. Maybe with good manners or something.

37:49.391 --> 37:51.382
- Politely.
- You wanna calm down.

37:51.400 --> 37:52.898
Girls in this city are filthy.

37:52.935 --> 37:54.680
Maybe I like filthy.

38:20.498 --> 38:21.520
I have to go.

38:21.772 --> 38:23.040
I've got class.

38:24.033 --> 38:25.360
See you later.

38:32.656 --> 38:35.549
- What?
- My brother came to stay.

38:37.317 --> 38:38.926
OK.

38:39.307 --> 38:42.563
I haven't seen him in 7 years.

38:43.921 --> 38:46.014
We don't get on, he's a...

38:46.237 --> 38:47.760
he's difficult.

38:48.870 --> 38:50.898
Or maybe I'm difficult.

38:52.749 --> 38:54.600
Always been trouble.

38:55.080 --> 38:56.760
My kids love him.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.457
My wife wants him out, and...

39:00.577 --> 39:03.238
it's just... I don't
know, it's more pressure.

39:03.266 --> 39:04.829
How old are your kids?

39:05.275 --> 39:08.040
Girl's 13, boy's 10.

39:11.958 --> 39:13.359
Do you like him?

39:13.605 --> 39:14.960
Your brother.

39:18.973 --> 39:20.560
Not much.

39:23.344 --> 39:25.828
I learned more about you
in the last 60 seconds

39:25.840 --> 39:28.080
than in the 5 months since we met.

39:31.112 --> 39:32.925
Is that what we're doing now?

39:33.363 --> 39:34.720
Sharing?

39:37.632 --> 39:39.380
I think I need to.

39:43.702 --> 39:45.302
My mom has cancer.

39:45.628 --> 39:46.688
What?

39:47.442 --> 39:48.720
When?

39:49.107 --> 39:50.716
About a month ago.

39:50.930 --> 39:54.030
Cervical. We don't know if
there's any secondary yet...

39:56.759 --> 39:58.160
I'm sorry.

40:03.838 --> 40:05.419
If you wanna talk,

40:05.847 --> 40:07.320
or fuck,

40:08.107 --> 40:09.484
call.

40:23.513 --> 40:28.257
- In English words of "a clowning", "pansies".
- Pansies?

40:28.920 --> 40:30.573
- "Daisies".
- "Hyacinths".

40:30.600 --> 40:32.499
- What?
- "Hyacinths".

40:32.508 --> 40:35.680
"Hyacinths". Can't say that.

40:35.875 --> 40:38.861
Hey, can... can you give me some
money so I can buy some rollies?

40:38.880 --> 40:40.554
Hey, my board, boy.

40:44.229 --> 40:46.165
Let's go to the hotel. Come back tomorrow.

40:46.193 --> 40:49.240
It's only our first day. Get used to it.

40:53.730 --> 40:57.457
There's like 300 people named
BastiÃ¨re in this fucking town.

40:57.467 --> 40:59.690
Do you think he's even using his real name?

41:03.960 --> 41:05.840
I'm fucking bored.

41:08.769 --> 41:10.320
What are you doing?

41:10.323 --> 41:12.853
I didn't come to London
to sit in a fucking car.

41:12.880 --> 41:14.648
That's exactly why you came to London.

41:15.309 --> 41:16.928
We don't know if it's that one or that one,

41:16.928 --> 41:19.505
or any of these places you've
been staring at all day.

41:19.523 --> 41:21.532
He got the ticket here.
That's all we've got.

41:22.035 --> 41:23.700
Don't touch my keys.

41:24.779 --> 41:26.184
Your keys?

41:29.327 --> 41:31.867
Who's the boss? Who's
the boss? Who's the boss?

41:31.904 --> 41:33.190
Who's the boss?

41:33.848 --> 41:35.360
Who's the boss?

41:36.173 --> 41:38.611
You don't have fucking keys!

41:38.640 --> 41:40.164
Which house is it?

41:40.284 --> 41:42.965
Which one, this one? This one?

41:43.281 --> 41:44.574
Shit!

41:46.360 --> 41:47.625
Nico!

41:50.520 --> 41:51.885
Open! Come on!

41:52.840 --> 41:54.043
Open!

41:55.764 --> 41:57.240
- What's going on?
- Where is he?

41:57.360 --> 41:59.160
I'm sorry, I've got no id...

41:59.280 --> 42:01.710
- Where the fuck is he?
- Nico!

42:01.830 --> 42:03.095
Nico, come on!

42:04.239 --> 42:06.480
- My God...
- Move!

42:06.960 --> 42:08.206
Move!

42:10.615 --> 42:12.066
Push it!

42:47.518 --> 42:48.774
Where are the kids?

42:49.248 --> 42:52.839
Oliver's playing football.
Maddy's, I don't know. Somewhere.

42:53.359 --> 42:56.150
She's a bit hurt. I'd give her some space.

42:59.824 --> 43:01.071
I'm really sorry.

43:01.973 --> 43:03.034
I know.

43:10.447 --> 43:12.230
Martin and I winged it.

43:12.480 --> 43:14.178
I think she's got a good chance.

43:18.522 --> 43:19.560
Where is he?

43:19.917 --> 43:21.240
Upstairs.

43:25.684 --> 43:26.912
It smells good.

43:55.813 --> 43:56.939
Where you going?

43:57.246 --> 43:58.548
I'm leaving.

43:59.581 --> 44:02.592
- You don't have to go.
- Sure I do. You know that.

44:02.712 --> 44:04.201
Just like that?

44:04.470 --> 44:07.940
Well, excuse me, I forgot my manners.
Thank you for your hospitality.

44:08.294 --> 44:11.568
- You've been a wonderful host.
- Not everything is a joke.

44:11.600 --> 44:13.251
It's a matter of opinion.

44:14.665 --> 44:16.758
Nelson Clay thinks I'm an idiot.

44:18.080 --> 44:21.040
- And yo'ure the golden child, as always.
- Oh, come on!

44:24.257 --> 44:25.755
You gotta be smart.

44:25.978 --> 44:27.392
You keep your head down.

44:27.802 --> 44:29.420
Plan an escape.

44:30.556 --> 44:33.867
Some time, some way, it
will... it'll go wrong.

44:34.295 --> 44:35.374
I know.

44:47.086 --> 44:48.733
30 000.

44:50.240 --> 44:52.602
- Can you afford this?
- No.

44:59.188 --> 45:00.680
This is for mom.

45:02.537 --> 45:05.951
It'll buy her a nice dress,
and a decent meal now and then.

45:07.625 --> 45:09.820
It'll be the last time I see her.

45:10.648 --> 45:12.508
When is your last time gonna be?

45:13.029 --> 45:15.280
- Her funeral?
- Don't do that.

45:18.936 --> 45:20.200
Thank you.

45:21.440 --> 45:22.527
Come here.

45:57.885 --> 45:59.559
You're needed.

45:59.997 --> 46:01.550
Give it to Efe.

46:01.932 --> 46:03.783
They've asked for you personally.

46:04.871 --> 46:07.132
- Sorry.
- OK.

47:01.151 --> 47:02.398
Boss.

47:04.351 --> 47:05.550
What is it?

47:05.561 --> 47:07.179
Nobody's talking much.

47:07.440 --> 47:08.742
I think he's a cop.

47:10.072 --> 47:11.480
Have you been drinking?

47:11.905 --> 47:13.895
- One pint.
- You're on call.

47:14.015 --> 47:15.640
Come on, man.

47:15.760 --> 47:16.956
Just stay out of the way.

47:16.975 --> 47:19.765
I had a single fucking
drink, I can still do my job.

47:19.775 --> 47:22.109
Then how come you stink of rhum?

47:39.449 --> 47:40.733
What's going on?

47:40.984 --> 47:42.840
Tom Kendrick, John.

47:43.923 --> 47:45.598
Put a gun in his mouth.

47:47.504 --> 47:49.049
Wife found him.

47:51.532 --> 47:53.607
The department will cover the bill.

47:54.053 --> 47:55.049
Of course.

47:56.760 --> 47:58.211
How did it happen?

47:58.248 --> 47:59.978
You know he was under investigation.

48:00.183 --> 48:01.616
I had heard.

48:01.736 --> 48:03.040
Pressure.

48:03.160 --> 48:04.555
Couldn't face it.

48:05.680 --> 48:08.416
Word is, then man may
have had something to hide.

48:08.965 --> 48:10.295
Fuck, man,

48:10.491 --> 48:12.909
he could have retired,
and avoid the disciplinary,

48:13.430 --> 48:15.680
- hid behind a lawyer.
- He sat here?

48:15.681 --> 48:18.099
CID have took his computer, files.

48:18.120 --> 48:19.541
It's tragic, isn't it?

48:19.838 --> 48:21.755
It can be a brave way out, suicide.

48:21.959 --> 48:23.113
Bollocks.

48:25.318 --> 48:26.797
It's selfish.

48:28.472 --> 48:30.470
We'll be done in a couple hours.

49:23.184 --> 49:26.320
So, who's gonna deal
with The Met contracts,

49:26.337 --> 49:28.551
now this guy is dead?

49:29.128 --> 49:30.644
I don't know.

49:31.128 --> 49:32.542
Somebody new.

49:33.658 --> 49:35.956
Will it affect what contracts we get?

49:38.607 --> 49:40.080
It's possible.

49:45.295 --> 49:46.886
It's weird, isn't it?

49:47.202 --> 49:50.532
That one person's death can
affect so many other people.

49:52.133 --> 49:55.176
Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding
me! What the fuck is wrong with you?

49:55.210 --> 49:57.314
What the fuck you think you're doing?

49:57.333 --> 49:58.859
What's going on? What's going on?

49:58.887 --> 50:00.580
He's drinking Tom Kendrick's booze.

50:01.268 --> 50:03.854
- I'm parched, I was looking for a drink.
- Vodka and coke!

50:03.891 --> 50:07.249
- More vodka than coke.
- That wasn't my glass. He's topped it up.

50:08.636 --> 50:09.520
You're fired.

50:09.770 --> 50:12.440
- What?
- You're disrespectful,

50:12.560 --> 50:14.040
you do a bad job,

50:14.263 --> 50:16.040
and you need help for your drinking.

50:16.068 --> 50:18.487
- Look, I'm not sure firing him is the answer...
- Stay out of it please.

50:18.607 --> 50:20.208
It's not the first time.

50:21.398 --> 50:24.729
Could you go to the van with him,
make sure he returns all his equipment?

50:27.164 --> 50:29.165
- Don't be stupid.
- Please go with him,

50:29.189 --> 50:30.427
- all right?
- Of course.

50:30.457 --> 50:32.840
- I'll finish up.
- Why is Maureen lying for you?

50:33.666 --> 50:34.988
What's she covering?

50:37.200 --> 50:38.251
He's desperate.

52:14.177 --> 52:16.790
Give me that before you hurt yourself.

52:19.315 --> 52:21.435
- Did you forget something?
- No.

52:22.441 --> 52:23.560
What are you doing?

52:23.739 --> 52:24.810
I'm living in the moment.

52:24.930 --> 52:26.340
You should try, it's liberating.

52:29.328 --> 52:31.209
- Did you break a window?
- Yeah.

52:31.953 --> 52:33.305
The little.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.978
- I've just fixed that.
- I know.

52:36.280 --> 52:37.782
But second time's a charm.

52:39.877 --> 52:40.883
Listen...

52:42.312 --> 52:44.116
You don't know these people like I do.

52:45.040 --> 52:46.742
I would feel bad if something happened.

52:54.749 --> 52:55.880
I'm tired.

53:53.645 --> 53:55.680
- Hello?
- How did it go?

53:57.865 --> 53:59.484
Fine, it was OK.

53:59.907 --> 54:01.413
The story was accepted?

54:02.890 --> 54:03.652
Yeah.

54:04.840 --> 54:06.617
If they've had any doubt,

54:06.676 --> 54:08.427
they wouldn't have allowed
us to clean the scene.

54:08.707 --> 54:10.362
I heard there was some trouble,

54:10.636 --> 54:12.249
with one of your guys.

54:13.320 --> 54:14.880
I took care of it.

54:16.410 --> 54:17.821
It's complicated, isn't it?

54:19.143 --> 54:20.535
All of this.

54:21.274 --> 54:22.923
Is your family awake yet?

54:23.721 --> 54:24.513
No.

54:25.399 --> 54:26.578
Get some rest

54:27.227 --> 54:28.519
while you can.

55:01.139 --> 55:02.913
Come on!

55:03.360 --> 55:05.910
I'm trying to fucking sleep!

55:06.030 --> 55:07.520
You like it?

55:07.640 --> 55:09.125
Who's the best?

55:09.330 --> 55:10.806
Who's the best?

55:13.875 --> 55:15.273
Who's the best?

55:16.097 --> 55:17.565
- Who?
- You're the best!

55:17.597 --> 55:19.073
- Who?
- You're the best!

55:19.097 --> 55:20.416
