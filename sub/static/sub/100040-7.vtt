WEBVTT

00:09.592 --> 00:12.846
As you reach the end of your first year
in the afterlife...

00:12.929 --> 00:14.681
<i>what do you remember most? </i>

00:14.764 --> 00:16.891
<i>The everlasting friendships you made?</i>

00:16.975 --> 00:19.769
<i>The adversity you overcame together?</i>

00:19.853 --> 00:22.063
<i>The day everything was chocolate?</i>

00:22.147 --> 00:23.690
That day was awesome.

00:23.773 --> 00:27.235
I had a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.
It was all chocolate.

00:27.318 --> 00:28.153
[shushing]

00:28.236 --> 00:30.655
[Eleanor]<i> You only have a few hours left</i>
<i>in your first year,</i>

00:30.739 --> 00:34.200
<i>so why not do as many amazing good deeds</i>
<i>for other people</i>

00:34.284 --> 00:37.412
<i>as you possibly can by midnight?</i>
<i>Just in case.</i>

00:37.495 --> 00:38.747
[sighs]

00:38.830 --> 00:40.665
I know. I know. I'll take it out.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.667
I'm a little tired, okay? Lay off.

00:42.751 --> 00:46.963
That movie, minus the part where Eleanor
gives away the entire experiment,

00:47.046 --> 00:49.007
will play before the party tonight.

00:49.090 --> 00:52.552
Speaking of which, the theme is
One Year Down, Infinity to Go.

00:52.635 --> 00:54.637
Dress is London black tie.

00:54.721 --> 00:58.099
That means Knightsbridge black tie,
not Kensington.

00:58.183 --> 01:01.978
Or heaven forbid West Brompton. [laughing]

01:02.062 --> 01:04.105
Can you imagine? [laughing]

01:04.189 --> 01:05.273
[chuckling] No.

01:05.356 --> 01:08.610
Also, just after midnight,
in order to reset my processing power,

01:08.693 --> 01:12.072
I will be violently eating
my Janet babies.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.948
I'd advise no one look directly at me.

01:14.032 --> 01:18.286
Copy that. So, tonight at the party,
we're going for one more point grab.

01:18.369 --> 01:20.663
I'm gonna suggest they make
toasts about each other,

01:20.747 --> 01:24.042
celebrate their ups and downs,
demonstrate personal growth,

01:24.125 --> 01:26.711
blah, blah, blah, humanity is saved!

01:26.795 --> 01:28.046
[all chuckling]

01:28.129 --> 01:30.965
One more day, guys. Let's finish strong.

01:31.049 --> 01:35.553
And to that end, as you might know,
I've been practicing human magic.

01:35.637 --> 01:36.513
Oh!

01:38.056 --> 01:39.682
-Ta-da!
-[Jason] Dope.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.601
[Michael chuckling] So, I was thinking--

01:41.684 --> 01:44.729
No, the Magnificent Dr. Presto
is not performing tonight.

01:44.813 --> 01:47.065
-Come on, I--
-Dude, magic is always lame,

01:47.148 --> 01:50.735
but it's especially lame here,
where there's actual magic.

01:50.819 --> 01:53.947
As a counter argument...
check your pocket.

01:56.574 --> 01:57.951
The other one.

01:59.244 --> 02:02.372
Oh, shoot, sorry. [chuckles lightly]
It's my pocket.

02:03.414 --> 02:05.500
-Ta-da!
-Dope.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.168
You know what? You can perform.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.420
-Really?
-Yeah, you changed my mind

02:09.504 --> 02:10.880
with that pocket thing.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.132
Oh, boffo! [chuckles lightly]

02:13.049 --> 02:14.217
Oh.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.760
-You're being mean.
-Yep.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.811
I am very excited for tonight.

02:24.894 --> 02:27.564
And dare I say, you all look so splendid,

02:27.647 --> 02:30.692
you could work the coat check
at the Met Gala.

02:30.775 --> 02:33.611
Oh, speaking of the Met Gala,
remember that security cam footage

02:33.695 --> 02:35.947
of Solange and Jay-Z
fighting in the elevator?

02:36.030 --> 02:38.533
I learned to read lips.
Turns out she was yelling,

02:38.616 --> 02:41.244
"No fair! I wanted to be
the one to push the button."

02:41.327 --> 02:42.787
[chuckles]

02:42.871 --> 02:46.541
So, uh, yeah, it wasn't as juicy
as some people maybe thought it was.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.210
-[door opens]
-Hey, gang. Had a pretty good round today.

02:49.294 --> 02:52.255
Better close this door. I don't want
all those birdies to follow me in here.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.716
-[chuckles]
-[groans] Why?

02:54.799 --> 02:56.718
Okay, Brent, hurry up and change
so we can get to the party.

02:56.801 --> 02:57.719
Oh, right, hang on.

02:57.802 --> 03:00.096
Uh, Janet gave me this...

03:00.179 --> 03:01.306
Tuxedo in a can.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.225
-[Tahani] Oh!
-[Chidi] Ooh.

03:04.309 --> 03:07.687
I came this close to firing Janet,
but she's gotten a lot better.

03:07.770 --> 03:10.356
Okay. We're not leaving yet.
I need to show you all something.

03:11.232 --> 03:14.360
This is the result
of months of observation.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.071
Now, I know
you're gonna think I'm crazy...

03:17.155 --> 03:18.948
No, why would we think that?

03:19.032 --> 03:21.200
But there is something wrong
with this neighborhood.

03:21.993 --> 03:24.037
And it involves the people in this room.

03:25.663 --> 03:28.124
[Eleanor] So crazy that we're
at the end of this thing

03:28.207 --> 03:29.918
and we have no idea how we did.

03:30.501 --> 03:34.547
Janet, any chance you could
get a look inside that obelisk?

03:34.631 --> 03:36.049
Check that magic scoreboard?

03:36.132 --> 03:37.800
There is a chance, yes.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.553
About one in 970 trillion.

03:40.637 --> 03:41.971
Let's give her a whirl.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.058
It did not work.

03:45.141 --> 03:46.100
I'll be right back.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.310
Ugh!

03:48.019 --> 03:53.274
I feel okay about most of it, but I just
wish we had one concrete sign

03:53.358 --> 03:54.567
that Brent has improved.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.653
One moment where he bumps into someone

03:56.736 --> 03:59.197
and sincerely says,
"Oops, my bad," you know?

03:59.280 --> 04:00.740
I would kill for an "Oops, my bad."

04:00.823 --> 04:02.951
Who's a girl gotta fork
to get an "Oops, my bad"?

04:03.034 --> 04:06.454
Hey, hey, hey, panicking about
this experiment at crucial moments

04:06.537 --> 04:07.956
is kinda my move.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.707
-Don't fall apart on me now.
-I won't.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.210
It's just... You know me.

04:12.293 --> 04:15.004
On Earth, I never played a game
unless I knew I could either win,

04:15.088 --> 04:17.340
or bribe the ref so he'd throw it for me,

04:17.423 --> 04:22.053
and if we lose, I'm gonna be so mad.
[groans]

04:22.136 --> 04:23.221
Just one more day.

04:23.304 --> 04:26.266
We're gonna stick to the plan,
not do anything radical.

04:26.349 --> 04:31.521
Though we could do something... magical.

04:31.604 --> 04:32.897
You gotta let it go, man.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.232
She's right.

04:35.483 --> 04:38.152
[Simone] I've been suspicious
about this place since day one.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.154
Over the last few months,
I've been collecting data,

04:40.238 --> 04:41.322
and now I am positive.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.116
Something is truly forked up.

04:43.199 --> 04:44.951
You didn't tell me
about any of this, muffin!

04:45.034 --> 04:46.411
Okay, you call her "muffin?"

04:46.911 --> 04:49.080
I'm getting a lot of breaking news
at once here.

04:49.163 --> 04:50.123
I was gathering evidence.

04:50.206 --> 04:52.792
I didn't want to compromise the integrity
of the data collection.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.335
Oh, so romantic.

04:55.670 --> 04:56.838
Here's what I know...

04:56.921 --> 05:00.216
Eleanor and Michael are up to something,
and it's focused on us.

05:00.300 --> 05:04.637
I mean, there are 300 people
in the neighborhood, and somehow,

05:04.721 --> 05:07.557
they just spend all their time
talking to the six people in this room.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.892
Well, I mean, who else
are they gonna talk to? [chuckles lightly]

05:09.976 --> 05:11.019
Dumb Shorts Cathy?

05:11.102 --> 05:13.271
-[chuckles]
-What is your problem with her?

05:13.354 --> 05:17.025
-I mean... shorts? "Cathy"?
-[Brent chuckles]

05:17.108 --> 05:18.568
What isn't my problem with her?

05:19.360 --> 05:21.154
Jianyu, you okay? You look sweaty.

05:21.237 --> 05:22.989
Oh, no, he's fine.

05:23.072 --> 05:25.658
He always sweats when he's meditating.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.493
He calls it "sweat-itating."

05:28.077 --> 05:32.707
No, I mean, um, he doesn't talk,
so I call it that. [chuckles nervously]

05:32.790 --> 05:34.167
I'm friends with Sting.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.710
I can't take it anymore.

05:35.793 --> 05:39.255
I know something and it's just graduated
from hot goss to relevant AF.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.215
Yes, I'm gonna. I'm gonna.

05:41.299 --> 05:46.554
That's not Jianyu. His name is Jason,
and he's here by mistake.

05:46.637 --> 05:49.390
Chidi's been helping him hide
and become a better person.

05:49.891 --> 05:50.725
[exhales sharply]

05:50.808 --> 05:53.936
I also knew about this, of course.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.064
Might as well come clean, darling.

05:58.316 --> 06:01.569
Hi, Simone.
Jason Mendoza, Jacksonville, Florida.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.237
Go, Jags, obviously.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.947
Um, what else about me...

06:05.031 --> 06:06.115
I was born in a swimming pool...

06:06.199 --> 06:08.659
Okay. You never told me about this, Ducky!

06:08.743 --> 06:12.371
"Ducky?" I'm gonna have to sit down.
This is too much.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.665
Well, I swore I wouldn't tell,

06:14.749 --> 06:17.877
and keeping your word is a central tenet
of deontological ethics.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.629
Oh, so romantic.

06:19.712 --> 06:24.967
Okay, let's assume certain things are odd
about this place. What is your theory?

06:25.051 --> 06:25.885
I don't know.

06:26.761 --> 06:28.179
Maybe this isn't the Good Place.

06:28.262 --> 06:29.472
Maybe it's a test.

06:29.555 --> 06:32.600
My best guess,
it's some kind of experiment.

06:32.683 --> 06:34.560
We're being observed
in a closed environment.

06:35.436 --> 06:37.980
Simone, look at this logically.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.066
We are in paradise.

06:40.149 --> 06:43.319
There's fresh air, mountains, Janet!

06:43.402 --> 06:46.030
And yes, some of us are under 5'10",

06:46.114 --> 06:49.367
but other than that,
it is literally perfect here.

06:49.450 --> 06:50.493
[Simone] No, it is not.

06:50.576 --> 06:51.828
Jason is proof.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.747
And if you need more evidence
that this isn't the Good Place,

06:54.831 --> 06:57.166
clearly, he's not the only one
who doesn't belong.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.337
Actually, she's right.
And I know it for a fact.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.507
For the first time ever,
I am desperate for you to keep talking.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.884
Well, right at the beginning,
I talked to Mike and Eleanor,

07:06.968 --> 07:08.803
and they were like,
"Yeah, don't tell anyone this,

07:08.886 --> 07:12.765
but there's a place better than this,
the Best Place,

07:12.849 --> 07:14.517
and that's where you're headed, <i>amigo."</i>

07:14.600 --> 07:15.852
I don't think they actually
called you <i>"amigo."</i>

07:15.935 --> 07:18.104
I had to go through the year here,
kind of a test I guess,

07:18.187 --> 07:19.230
which, obviously, I aced.

07:19.313 --> 07:22.150
So, at midnight I'm on the first Escalade
out of here, baby.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.151
-Brent?
-Yeah?

07:23.234 --> 07:24.402
-Think about this.
-Okay.

07:24.485 --> 07:27.405
How could you get into the Best Place?

07:27.488 --> 07:32.869
You would literally have to be one of the
most incredible people in the universe.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.832
It makes sense to me.
I don't know what to tell you. [scoffs]

07:37.915 --> 07:40.418
Okay, in the words of Princess Kate

07:40.501 --> 07:42.462
after we came back
from our shopping trip in Ibiza,

07:42.545 --> 07:44.005
"There's a lot to unpack here."

07:44.088 --> 07:47.967
Perhaps we should just put
our concerns aside and enjoy ourselves.

07:48.050 --> 07:49.260
No way.

07:49.343 --> 07:52.221
We have to figure out exactly
what is going on here.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.725
Okay, just go to the party,
but keep your eyes open.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.477
-I've got a special mission for us.
-Oh, I--

07:57.560 --> 08:00.646
Oh, good.
Muffin and Ducky are on the case.

08:02.940 --> 08:03.941
[indistinct chatter]

08:06.777 --> 08:08.613
-How's it going?
-Awesome.

08:08.696 --> 08:11.157
-No, it isn't.
-Oh, yeah, terrible.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.076
[sighs] Simone knows the neighborhood
isn't what it appears to be.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.912
She's been collecting evidence for months.

08:15.995 --> 08:19.665
So, all that hanging out with Brent,
and participating in group activities...

08:19.749 --> 08:21.083
Was under false pretenses.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.753
She was observing him.
She's been observing everything.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.838
-Guys, pick a card.
-[Eleanor gasps]

08:25.922 --> 08:27.507
-Yes.
-No time.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.799
The subjects are onto us.

08:28.883 --> 08:32.720
They know something weird is going on,
and it could derail the entire experiment.

08:32.803 --> 08:35.056
Oh, no.

08:35.139 --> 08:37.642
Oh, sorry, uh, that was unintentional.

08:40.102 --> 08:40.937
[Chidi] What?

08:42.063 --> 08:44.607
[Simone] There's nothing here.
Did you find anything?

08:44.690 --> 08:47.276
Just some song lyrics Michael wrote.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.821
"Here's a trippy little ditty,
'bout a train to Groovy City.

08:50.905 --> 08:55.409
Open up your freaky crystal mind,
and we'll have a cosmic good time."

08:55.493 --> 08:57.411
That makes me think we're in hell.

08:57.495 --> 09:00.373
Look, we tried to prove your theory,
but it feels like we came up empty.

09:00.456 --> 09:04.418
Chidi, there is so much evidence they've
been lying. How can you not see that?

09:04.502 --> 09:06.337
Eleanor told me
that this was her first neighborhood.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.881
Maybe some of these
are just honest mistakes.

09:09.799 --> 09:15.972
And, also, she told me some other stuff
that I really want to be true.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.474
What kind of stuff?

09:18.558 --> 09:22.353
Well, it was something about us.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.317
Why does everything I do fall apart
so close to the end?

09:28.401 --> 09:30.778
My first experiment, now this experiment.

09:30.861 --> 09:34.949
I only got halfway through writing
"The Purple Train to Groovy City."

09:35.032 --> 09:37.451
-I just ran out of creative juice.
-[Eleanor] Focus.

09:37.535 --> 09:40.246
We cannot let this slip away from us
at the last second.

09:40.329 --> 09:42.707
New plan, forget the toasts.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.166
We do nothing,

09:44.250 --> 09:46.127
and we hope that our early successes

09:46.210 --> 09:48.588
make up for the embarrassing mess
we've become.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.631
Like Facebook or America.

09:50.715 --> 09:53.217
Okay? Sound good? Michael?

09:53.301 --> 09:57.138
We have no way to know
what this really means for the experiment.

09:57.805 --> 10:00.266
I don't think we can play it safe.
I have a plan.

10:00.349 --> 10:04.729
It's risky, but it might be the only way
to get them to where they need to be.

10:06.147 --> 10:06.981
Do you trust me?

10:08.065 --> 10:10.651
Yeah, fork it. Whatever it is, I'm in.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.029
-I'm always down for forking it.
-We trust you, Michael.

10:13.112 --> 10:17.825
Then trust...
the Magnificent Dr. Presto!

10:17.908 --> 10:22.705
Man, you cannot pull that hat out
after you ask us if we trust you.

10:23.372 --> 10:24.373
Soulmates?

10:24.957 --> 10:27.251
That's what Eleanor said,
that we're soulmates?

10:27.335 --> 10:28.878
Yep. Pretty neat, huh?

10:28.961 --> 10:31.672
I think it's pretty neat. Do you think
it's pretty neat, intensely, forever?

10:32.715 --> 10:37.053
Chidi, I really like you,
but I don't think we're soulmates.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.430
Because I don't think
soulmates actually exist.

10:40.056 --> 10:40.890
Right.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.351
Right, right.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.519
-Right?
-Think rationally.

10:45.603 --> 10:48.481
Isn't it weird that she only told
one of us that we're soulmates?

10:48.564 --> 10:51.484
Is it odd? Yes.

10:51.567 --> 10:54.320
Does it mean that Eleanor's motives
are questionable?

10:54.403 --> 10:55.738
Also, yes.

10:55.821 --> 10:58.491
But does it suggest
that she wasn't being truthful?

10:58.574 --> 11:00.618
Yes. Okay, I'm starting to see your point.

11:00.701 --> 11:01.702
[Simone] Whoa!

11:04.455 --> 11:06.248
What does that mean?

11:06.749 --> 11:08.459
Why are there only four of us?
Why not Tahani and Jason?

11:08.542 --> 11:11.212
Why are there emojis?
I mean, one of them's party hat guy.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.880
I mean, that's good, right? He's friendly.

11:12.963 --> 11:16.676
It's better than thermometer guy,
or angry cat or smiling poop coil.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.010
Okay. We have to get back to the party

11:18.094 --> 11:19.845
before Eleanor and Michael
notice we're missing.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.222
Great plan. Let's kiss.

11:21.305 --> 11:23.516
Sorry, still thinking about
the soulmate thing.

11:23.599 --> 11:24.975
-Let's go.
-Okay.

11:25.059 --> 11:28.521
[Eleanor] Ladies and gentlemen...
I can't believe I'm saying this.

11:28.604 --> 11:30.940
The Magnificent Dr. Presto!

11:31.023 --> 11:32.066
[crowd applauding]

11:32.858 --> 11:36.737
Thank you. Now, I know some of you
may not believe in magic--

11:36.821 --> 11:38.447
Well, I think they believe in some magic.

11:38.531 --> 11:42.284
Yesterday, everybody ate a lollipop
that let them talk to birds.

11:42.368 --> 11:45.246
-[crowd applauding]
-Okay, but this is Earth magic,

11:45.329 --> 11:49.583
and it's harder,
and if you don't understand that,

11:49.667 --> 11:54.380
I'm here... to change your mind.

11:54.463 --> 11:55.673
Ha-ha! [chuckles]

11:55.756 --> 12:00.136
Oh, come on. It started out as
a dollar bill and now it's four quarters.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.303
"Change" your mind?

12:01.387 --> 12:02.888
-Michael, it's three quarters.
-What?

12:02.972 --> 12:04.014
Oh, oh...

12:04.098 --> 12:05.224
Three quarters.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.769
Three quarters. Even harder.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.271
-Thank you.
-[scattered applause]

12:10.354 --> 12:11.814
Can you make them clap harder?

12:11.897 --> 12:13.441
They see what they see, man.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.151
Did you guys find anything?

12:15.234 --> 12:19.071
Yes, proof that the four of us, and only
the four of us, are being forked with.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.866
But we still don't have any hard proof
that this place is evil,

12:21.949 --> 12:24.785
or that Michael and Eleanor
are nefarious, so, you know,

12:24.869 --> 12:26.829
no one's heart needs to break just yet.

12:26.912 --> 12:28.747
I'm with him. This place is fine.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.666
If you guys don't make the cut
for the Best Place,

12:30.749 --> 12:33.711
I'll try to put in a good word for you.
You guys got business cards?

12:33.794 --> 12:36.338
Brent. I need a volunteer. Come on up.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.257
[resident whoops]

12:38.340 --> 12:43.387
Okay, Brent, I want you to take off
your wristwatch and place it in my hat.

12:43.471 --> 12:47.475
Now, this is a Rolex. It's the exact same
watch Richie Sambora wears.

12:47.558 --> 12:48.559
-Ah!
-Be careful.

12:48.642 --> 12:53.439
And now, the Magnificent Dr. Presto...

12:53.522 --> 12:55.316
will transform your...

12:55.399 --> 12:56.817
-[ground rumbling]
-[Michael] Oh, oh...

12:56.901 --> 12:58.527
[crowd exclaiming]

12:58.611 --> 13:00.488
[people screaming]

13:00.571 --> 13:01.822
[Michael] Oh, whoa, no, no!

13:01.906 --> 13:02.948
-[Brent screams]
-[thuds]

13:03.032 --> 13:04.325
[panicked chatter]

13:05.618 --> 13:07.828
Brent, can you hear me?

13:07.912 --> 13:12.166
If it somehow helps,
there's a small dove in your pocket.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.504
Never mind.

13:17.588 --> 13:21.759
[Michael] Brent, I'm so sorry.
I must've screwed up the trick somehow.

13:21.842 --> 13:24.011
Hold on. We're gonna get you out of there.

13:24.094 --> 13:24.929
[Brent] Yeah, you better.

13:25.012 --> 13:27.139
I got a hell of a lawsuit on my hands!
I'm gonna frickin' own this place.

13:27.765 --> 13:28.766
Okay.

13:28.849 --> 13:32.061
Okay, everyone, uh, please disperse.
We'll let you know when it's safe.

13:32.144 --> 13:35.147
Uh, you three stay here.
Keep an eye on Brent.

13:35.231 --> 13:38.859
We're gonna try and fix this remotely,
using eternal-being technology.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.779
-Tahani, Jianyu, try and find a rope.
-Right-o.

13:41.862 --> 13:45.074
Okay, so what do we do?
Try to climb down or wait for the rope?

13:45.157 --> 13:47.034
Neither, we get the fork out of here.

13:47.117 --> 13:50.454
Chidi, a giant hell-hole just opened up
and swallowed one of us.

13:50.538 --> 13:54.166
I don't care what this place really is.
Giant holes are bad and we should go.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.584
Or giant holes are bad,

13:55.668 --> 13:58.712
so if someone falls into one,
you try to help get him out.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.214
-[ground rumbles]
-[John screams]

14:00.297 --> 14:01.465
I'm not scared.

14:01.549 --> 14:04.176
I'm shouting so you know I'm okay.
I am very brave.

14:04.969 --> 14:09.098
Whoo! I hope this works. We basically
just confirmed that we're lying to them.

14:09.181 --> 14:12.601
Oh, man. Was this a bad idea?
I mean, what if this was a bad idea?

14:12.685 --> 14:14.103
It wasn't, homie. It was a good idea.

14:14.895 --> 14:17.231
-Can anyone else weigh in?
-[Jason] I'm serious.

14:17.314 --> 14:21.068
In football, trying to run out the clock
and hoping for the best never works.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.319
It's called prevent defense.

14:22.403 --> 14:25.114
You don't take any chances
and try and hang on to your lead.

14:25.197 --> 14:28.951
But prevent defense
just prevents you from winning.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.787
It's always better to try something.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.707
Jason, that was... coherent!

14:34.790 --> 14:37.209
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.044
It's a good plan, Michael.

14:39.128 --> 14:42.089
Hopefully, they've bonded enough
as a group to rescue Brent,

14:42.172 --> 14:44.258
call me, get a train
and all head out of here together.

14:44.341 --> 14:46.468
But was it a mistake to have
Brent fall in?

14:46.552 --> 14:50.097
We could've had Chidi fall in, right?
Or a cute baby panda.

14:50.180 --> 14:53.017
Or maybe, you know, a box of donuts.
Everyone loves donuts.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.518
Brent was the right choice.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.896
It's not a tough call
whether to save Chidi,

14:56.979 --> 14:59.523
because he's a brilliant and kind person,

14:59.607 --> 15:02.651
with a caboose you can bounce a quarter
off of and I know 'cause I've done it.

15:02.735 --> 15:06.739
We threw Brent in there
because there is no reason

15:06.822 --> 15:09.325
any of them should help him,
because Brent sucks.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.493
Brent is the opposite of a box of donuts.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.913
-Toilet full of broccoli.
-Yeah, kinda.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.998
Brent is a toilet full of broccoli.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.834
But because he sucks so bad,

15:18.918 --> 15:22.254
if they do risk their safety to help him,
they'll get more points.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.214
Basically, it's a Hail Mary.

15:24.298 --> 15:28.594
It's risky, but if we complete it,
we win the game.

15:28.677 --> 15:31.305
That was two good analogies in a row.

15:31.847 --> 15:34.266
I'm now worried
he's a demon in a Jason suit.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.436
Are we really in hell?

15:37.519 --> 15:42.024
I didn't lead a perfect life on Earth,
but I worked very hard.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.943
Making fun of people you'd never even met.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.611
I guess you must be right, Simone,

15:45.694 --> 15:47.613
because you always have to be.
[chuckles lightly]

15:47.696 --> 15:49.490
Hey, are you the bottom
of a coal-fired pizza?

15:49.573 --> 15:52.952
-Why, because I'm burnt?
-Gah! You are always right. [groans]

15:53.035 --> 15:55.537
If it is hell, I know why I'm here.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.832
Almond milk. I drank so much of it,

15:58.916 --> 16:01.168
despite the negative
environmental impacts.

16:01.251 --> 16:04.588
Wherever we are, I do not wanna be here
when the clock hits zero.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.632
Now might be our only chance to escape.

16:06.715 --> 16:07.633
Not without Brent.

16:07.716 --> 16:11.345
Do you think if the roles were reversed,
he would waste any time rescuing you?

16:11.428 --> 16:14.890
Maybe... if Elle Macpherson were nearby
and he wanted to impress her,

16:14.974 --> 16:17.685
or if he thought
that I was a prince he could ransom...

16:18.477 --> 16:22.064
That's not the point.
He is a person in a hole.

16:22.147 --> 16:26.193
I have a duty to help him get out.
What he would do is irrelevant.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.403
I don't think it is.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.114
If you do a science experiment
a thousand times

16:30.197 --> 16:32.574
and always get the same results,
you move on.

16:32.658 --> 16:36.036
We've given Brent a thousand chances
to be a good person.

16:36.120 --> 16:40.916
In one of them, he was so awful,
you punched him in the face.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.128
Okay, when I did that,
I thought cutting him out of our group

16:44.211 --> 16:47.923
meant that he would have to find
another place in heaven to hang out.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.259
That's changed. I can't just leave him.

16:51.760 --> 16:52.761
Well...

16:54.138 --> 16:55.472
I respect your position.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.101
I respect yours.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.691
Look, I know everything's
really scary right now,

17:05.774 --> 17:07.109
but I just have to say it.

17:07.985 --> 17:10.821
That was the most boring breakup
I've ever seen.

17:12.114 --> 17:12.948
[car engine starts]

17:15.159 --> 17:16.702
[Brent] Hey, Chidi, shake it off.

17:16.785 --> 17:19.121
-Another bus comes every 15 minutes.
-[Chidi] Brent.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.965
-Where are they?
-They never called a train.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.801
-They must've taken Brent's Escalade.
-Oh, that's good.

17:32.885 --> 17:36.472
The important thing is that
the group bonded and stayed together.

17:36.555 --> 17:39.641
-[Brent] Hello? Can someone help us?
-"Us"?

17:39.725 --> 17:42.227
Yeah, this frickin' genius
tried to help me and he fell in.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.938
-I thought you were smart, man.
-Are you serious right now?

17:45.022 --> 17:47.357
[Eleanor] Well, turns out the group
did not bond.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.276
The group snapped in half.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.490
Will you help us? These rocks are
really sharp down here.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.200
-I'm scared.
-I'm not.

17:56.283 --> 17:58.452
-Just give us a second.
-Guys, I think we're cooked.

17:58.535 --> 18:01.371
-It's over.
-No. No way.

18:01.455 --> 18:04.458
I am not giving up.
I told you I only play games I can win,

18:04.541 --> 18:06.585
and I played this game,
so that means we can win.

18:06.668 --> 18:08.545
-I don't think that tracks.
-Shut up. What do you know?

18:08.629 --> 18:12.674
Literally everything, but keep going.
I am liking this energy from you.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.969
We have eight minutes left,
so that means we keep trying.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.180
What else can we try?
We've already blown everything up.

18:18.263 --> 18:19.139
We can't blow it up again.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.599
If there's one thing I know in this world,

18:20.682 --> 18:23.393
it's that you can always
blow up the same thing twice.

18:24.561 --> 18:25.562
He's right.

18:26.688 --> 18:28.315
We have one last move here.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.110
Guys, we are so sorry about your ordeal.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.028
We just have a few questions for you.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.031
Where are John and Simone?
We can't find them.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.535
They left.
I don't know where they went.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.286
Typical. Disloyal jerks.

18:42.079 --> 18:45.124
You know, man, actually,
they really tried with you,

18:45.207 --> 18:46.542
and you made it very hard
to be your friend.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.460
You wanna know what happened?

18:48.544 --> 18:50.671
They got jealous
because I'm going to the Best Place.

18:50.754 --> 18:51.797
They bugged out.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.298
You're not going to the Best Place.

18:53.382 --> 18:56.176
Don't you get it? They're torturing you.
They're torturing all of us.

18:56.844 --> 18:57.886
[Brent scoffs]

18:57.970 --> 19:00.264
Because this is the Bad Place.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.060
[both cackling]

19:09.064 --> 19:12.151
Oh, man.
I can't believe you figured it out.

19:12.234 --> 19:16.405
Wait, he's right?
This is the Bad Place?

19:16.488 --> 19:18.615
Yeah. Damn it, he's right.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.576
-We had a good run, though.
-We did.

19:20.659 --> 19:23.287
-[both chuckling]
-So, no Best Place?

19:23.370 --> 19:24.746
-[imitating Brent] "So, no Best Place?"
-No.

19:24.830 --> 19:28.542
Oh, Brent, you big white oaf.
Never change, bud. [chuckles]

19:28.625 --> 19:31.753
Well, I guess we should let them know
you guys are on your way.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.213
-Yeah.
-Wait. On our way where?

19:33.297 --> 19:34.590
The actual Bad Place.

19:34.673 --> 19:37.217
They let us toy with you a little
just for kicks,

19:37.301 --> 19:39.636
-but now you're going... [vocalizes]
-[Eleanor chuckles]

19:39.720 --> 19:41.096
[Michael] And trust me on this...

19:41.722 --> 19:43.182
it's a lot worse.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.267
[Eleanor and Michael cackling]

19:49.771 --> 19:52.232
-[Tahani] Well done.
-Let's hope it works.

19:52.316 --> 19:53.942
We only have a minute left.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.319
<i>Man, crazy twist, huh?</i>

19:56.320 --> 19:57.946
<i>It's like something</i>
<i>out of a Chip Driver novel.</i>

19:58.030 --> 20:01.158
-Leave me alone, Brent.
-I'm kinda freaking out over here, man.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.536
-You're my only real friend.
-I'm not your friend. I don't like you.

20:05.078 --> 20:06.788
-But you helped me.
-Yeah, I did.

20:06.872 --> 20:10.000
Because I have this stupid moral code
that forces me to help everyone.

20:10.083 --> 20:13.962
But you have never helped anyone
because you don't care about other people,

20:14.046 --> 20:16.048
which is the bare minimum
that a person has to do.

20:16.131 --> 20:18.258
Just care, a little,
about the other people around you,

20:18.342 --> 20:20.093
and you can't do it.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.557
What are you trying to say here?

20:27.643 --> 20:30.687
You are a bad person.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.984
-You can do this.
-Come on, dumb-dumb. Faster.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.614
No, I'm not.

20:41.448 --> 20:44.326
I'm not... I'm not a bad person.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.663
I'm not. I'm a good person.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.833
Oh, man.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.837
Oh, no, no, no.

20:57.005 --> 20:57.965
No, no.

20:58.590 --> 21:03.345
Look, Chidi, whatever happens next,
I, uh, need to say this to you.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.013
All right? I am...

21:05.681 --> 21:08.976
I am so, so sor--

21:17.776 --> 21:21.196
Sorry, Eleanor asked me to bring her this
the second the experiment was over.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.282
Well, you know what they say.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.784
It's zero o'clock in the sky somewhere.
