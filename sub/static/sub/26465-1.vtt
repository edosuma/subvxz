started working

22:51.469 --> 22:55.171
for this family
on a pecan ranch.

22:55.173 --> 22:57.142
- A pecan ranch?
- Yeah.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.844
Knocked up
the family's daughter.

23:01.846 --> 23:03.613
She was just shy of 18.

23:03.615 --> 23:05.916
Uh-oh. (LAUGHING)

23:05.918 --> 23:07.450
That's when
I came into the picture.

23:07.452 --> 23:09.018

The son of an 18-year-old.

23:09.020 --> 23:10.254
- Yeah.

23:10.256 --> 23:13.724

23:13.726 --> 23:15.959

- I'm sorry.

23:15.961 --> 23:18.261
He, uh...

23:18.263 --> 23:20.630
He died when I was 13,

23:20.632 --> 23:24.700
so I guess my brother would
tell you that he raised me,

23:24.702 --> 23:27.403
but I don't know. I don't know
who was raising who.

23:27.405 --> 23:32.711

Navajo, and nowhere to go.

I knew a couple of guys

29:32.670 --> 29:35.237
could sing Sinatra

that with Bobby

- a couple of weeks ago.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:21.885 --> 30:23.853
If we put the inner moles in,
we can actually use those

30:23.855 --> 30:25.723
to amplify the high
frequencies.

30:25.725 --> 30:27.224
- Yeah, okay, that sounds great.
- Cut down the sound.

01:42:05.552 --> 01:42:06.786
Once it's gone, it's gone.

01:42:06.788 --> 01:42:08.253
I don't know what you have.

01:42:08.255 --> 01:42:10.089
Oh, well, the tinnitus,
they say, once you...

01:42:10.091 --> 01:42:13.991
- Oh, tinnitus can't be fixed.
- Right.

01:42:13.993 --> 01:42:16.327
Well, I just hear that tone,
that's all.

01:42:16.329 --> 01:42:18.231
The tone, yeah.

01:42:18.233 --> 01:42:20.165
The ringing.

01:42:20.167 --> 01:42:21.668
I have hearing aids on,
as you...

01:42:21.670 --> 01:42:23.436
No, I know.
That's why I asked you.

01:42:23.438 --> 01:42:25.273
You know, I'm convinced that

01:42:26.841 --> 01:42:29.140
it happened when I
was younger, I used to...

01:42:29.142 --> 01:42:33.245
My dad had a Victrola,
an old record player.

01:42:33.247 --> 01:42:36.048
My head was just about the
size of it when I was a kid,

01:42:36.050 --> 01:42:39.785
and I used to love to just
put my whole head in there.

01:42:39.787 --> 01:42:44.356
He was big into
the blues, so...

01:42:44.358 --> 01:42:47.358
'Cause you gotta figure, it's
just me and him all day long.

01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:51.932
My brother's out there tryin'
to make something of himself.

01:42:53.066 --> 01:42:54.767
So I took one of his belts.

01:42:54.769 --> 01:42:59.173
I put it around
the ceiling fan

01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:02.377
and tried to do the deed.

01:43:04.112 --> 01:43:06.844
The whole fucking fan
came out of the ceiling.

01:43:06.846 --> 01:43:08.148
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:43:14.788 --> 01:43:17.823
Had a big cut
on my fucking forehead.

01:43:17.825 --> 01:43:21.962
I was more mad about that
than it not working.

01:43:23.663 --> 01:43:25.499
And he didn't even notice.

01:43:26.934 --> 01:43:28.299
He didn't even fucking notice.

01:43:28.301 --> 01:43:30.404
- 'Cause he was drunk?
- Yeah.

01:43:32.806 --> 01:43:36.877
That fucking fan stayed on the
floor for about half a year.

01:43:38.979 --> 01:43:41.045
How old were you then?

01:43:41.047 --> 01:43:43.484
I was just shy of 13.

01:43:47.721 --> 01:43:49.289

(BOTH CHUCKLING)

01:43:58.731 --> 01:44:00.432
You smell good.

01:44:00.434 --> 01:44:03.904
You smell good,
and you look good too.

01:44:07.675 --> 01:44:09.107
Swimming. I've been swimming.

01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:10.409
- You've been swimming?
- Yeah, there's a pool.

01:44:10.411 --> 01:44:12.376
- I love that you're swimming.
- Yeah.

01:44:12.378 --> 01:44:14.879
- That's a great pool there.
- Yeah.

01:44:14.881 --> 01:44:16.581
How's Charlie?

01:44:16.583 --> 01:44:18.384
Oh, Charlie's sweet.

01:44:18.386 --> 01:44:21.189
He just sort of sits
by the door like this.

01:44:24.091 --> 01:44:25.959
Waiting for daddy.

01:44:29.829 --> 01:44:31.865
We're both waiting for daddy.

01:44:34.801 --> 01:44:37.302
What, three weeks?

01:44:37.304 --> 01:44:38.972
You are gonna
come back, right?

01:44:40.507 --> 01:44:41.773
What do you mean?

01:44:41.775 --> 01:44:44.410
You gonna come home
when you're done?

01:44:44.412 --> 01:44:46.879
- Do you not want me to?
- No, I want you to.

01:44:46.881 --> 01:44:49.180
I'm just wondering if...
I just...

01:44:49.182 --> 01:44:50.616
- Where else would I go?
- I don't know.

01:44:50.618 --> 01:44:52.416
I guess I just thought...
You know, it's like...

01:44:52.418 --> 01:44:54.553
- There's Jack...
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:44:54.555 --> 01:44:57.121
- Why would you say that?
- I don't know. I guess...

01:44:57.123 --> 01:44:58.924
I wondered, without the booze,

01:44:58.926 --> 01:45:00.593
if you would want
to come home.

01:45:00.595 --> 01:45:02.126
'Cause when you met me,
you were drinking,

01:45:02.128 --> 01:45:03.963
and now you're not.

01:45:03.965 --> 01:45:06.098
I wasn't drunk the whole time
we were together.

01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:08.269
I know, but...

01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:12.170
But it got bad
when we were together.

01:45:12.172 --> 01:45:14.272
It's okay. I mean, it's fine.

01:45:14.274 --> 01:45:16.808
I just was wondering,
that's all,

01:45:16.810 --> 01:45:20.211
and whatever you want is okay.

01:45:20.213 --> 01:45:22.613
Whatever I want?
I wanna be with you.

01:45:22.615 --> 01:45:25.817
- That's why I'm here.
- Okay, I know, I know.

01:45:25.819 --> 01:45:28.322
I just want you to be happy.

01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:31.325
I'm working on that.

01:45:35.061 --> 01:45:36.997
I need to stick with you.

01:45:40.667 --> 01:45:42.202
I brought something.

01:45:44.872 --> 01:45:46.207
I wanna know

01:45:47.608 --> 01:45:49.142
what this is.

01:45:50.644 --> 01:45:52.978
"My Love."

01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:54.615

- (CHUCKLES)

01:45:55.716 --> 01:45:57.515
No, I wouldn't...

01:45:57.517 --> 01:46:00.587
I wouldn't say
I was hiding it. I just...

01:46:03.023 --> 01:46:04.522
I started puttin' it
down to paper

01:46:04.524 --> 01:46:06.026
when we were at home.

01:46:08.529 --> 01:46:10.696
I don't know, it just
sort of fell out of me,

01:46:10.698 --> 01:46:13.001
I guess, and onto this page.

01:46:16.436 --> 01:46:19.106
And I put it in here,
and I thought...

01:46:21.475 --> 01:46:25.179
I thought
maybe you'd find it

01:46:28.315 --> 01:46:30.518
when you came
back to you, maybe.

01:46:39.859 --> 01:46:41.429
Well, I found it.

I... (CONTINUES SOBBING)

It's okay.
It's not your fault.

01:47:31.744 --> 01:47:33.715
I'm sorry I did that.

01:47:35.849 --> 01:47:37.582
It's okay.

01:47:37.584 --> 01:47:40.253
It's not your fault.
It's a disease.

01:47:42.256 --> 01:47:44.325
No, but I embarrassed you.

01:47:46.392 --> 01:47:50.129
- I embarrassed you, and I...
- I'm not embarrassed of you.

01:47:50.131 --> 01:47:52.897
It was so wrong.

01:47:52.899 --> 01:47:55.702
And then your dad...

it's okay.

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:09.814
- It's okay.
- I know, but I...

01:48:09.816 --> 01:48:11.252
It's okay.

what I think is</i>

the best solution
for both of us.

01:48:19.193 --> 01:48:21.425
Jack should come out
on tour with me.

01:48:21.427 --> 01:48:24.095
We'll start with our duets.
I know he's gonna be able

01:48:24.097 --> 01:48:25.363
to play by himself.

01:48:25.365 --> 01:48:27.031
You realize
that's not an option.

01:48:27.033 --> 01:48:30.335
He's so inside of his art
in a way he has never been.

01:48:30.337 --> 01:48:33.004
- He can hear himself again.
- Ally, there is no way

01:48:33.006 --> 01:48:37.211
that you can take Jack on tour
with you. There is no way.

You know what? If you can't
make that happen,

01:48:53.526 --> 01:48:55.886
then fucking cancel the tour.

a better band name,

we might've made it.

01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:21.853
Or maybe it was 'cause

01:49:21.855 --> 01:49:24.121

a father and son duo.

say this to you.

you, she looks like a joke.

it's only a matter of time
