So, I was telling this

07:34.309 --> 07:37.809
The last testing we did
was 10, 15 years ago.

17:19.643 --> 17:20.934
Holy shit.

17:23.017 --> 17:24.059
Wait, it's you.

17:24.142 --> 17:25.893
Shit. Fuck. Ahh!

17:27.476 --> 17:28.601
Come back.

17:29.434 --> 17:30.726
Come back.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.142
(whistle squeaks)

17:33.225 --> 17:36.768
(whistle trills)

17:38.851 --> 17:40.309
(squeaks):
Come back.

17:40.392 --> 17:43.517
The Guy:
I got this toffee crunch
if you're into edibles.

17:43.601 --> 17:45.809
I got, uh, C-CBD.

17:45.893 --> 17:49.142
And also I got pens and flowers
if you're interested.

17:52.309 --> 17:54.476
And the gold ones are sativa.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.559
Okay, so you want that one.
Great.

17:58.643 --> 18:00.934
-Okay, one second.
-Okay.

18:08.768 --> 18:10.476
(clears throat)

18:14.476 --> 18:16.684
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

18:17.434 --> 18:18.768
It was nice to see you.

18:18.851 --> 18:21.768
-Always a pleazh.
-Yeah, it's great.

18:21.851 --> 18:24.100
Darby:
I'm curious
how often you think

18:24.184 --> 18:26.684
Craigslist missed
connections are about you.

18:29.517 --> 18:31.809
-Never.
-Ever?

18:31.893 --> 18:33.434
Except for now?

18:33.517 --> 18:36.601
-Wow. I'm so honored.
-This is my first one.

18:36.684 --> 18:39.851
Oh, my God.
What a special moment.

18:39.934 --> 18:42.851
-It's kind of like kismet.
-Totally cuckoo.

18:46.017 --> 18:47.434
Sorry.

18:47.517 --> 18:48.809
You're hot.

18:49.975 --> 18:51.309
(stammers)
Uh...

18:52.267 --> 18:53.726
People tell you that a lot?

18:54.351 --> 18:56.017
-Uh...
-Do you slay puss?

18:56.100 --> 18:57.684
-(both laughing)
-Yeah?

18:57.768 --> 18:59.851
-No... no.
-A little bit?

18:59.934 --> 19:03.726
Would you tell me
if I showed up here smelling?

19:03.809 --> 19:05.851
Smelling bad?
Would you say something?

19:08.392 --> 19:10.142
-If you smelled bad?
-Yeah.

19:10.225 --> 19:12.517
I haven't gotten
any complaints so far.

19:15.309 --> 19:16.809
I'm just joking around.

19:16.893 --> 19:18.726
I'm just being playful.

19:22.184 --> 19:24.059
-What?
-You're, uh--

19:25.559 --> 19:27.017
You're really forward.

19:28.267 --> 19:29.684
Thanks.

19:32.726 --> 19:33.851
So, what do you do?

19:35.059 --> 19:36.893
Oh, uh...

19:38.017 --> 19:40.893
Ask me a more interesting
question, please.

19:42.684 --> 19:43.768
Okay.

19:48.517 --> 19:49.726
I'm thinking.

19:51.809 --> 19:53.100
(laughs)

19:54.100 --> 19:55.100
(sighs)

19:55.184 --> 19:57.392
Do you make a lot of money?

19:57.476 --> 19:58.601
I do okay.

19:58.684 --> 20:00.267
Does that make your friends
uncomfortable?

20:00.351 --> 20:02.017
We don't really
talk about that.

20:02.100 --> 20:05.100
Do you spend a lot
of time alone?

20:07.267 --> 20:08.392
Yes.

20:09.142 --> 20:10.434
Do you?

20:11.267 --> 20:12.768
Yeah.

20:14.934 --> 20:17.434
Can I ask you
a personal question?

20:18.059 --> 20:19.142
Come here.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.684
Do you always...

20:29.768 --> 20:30.934
wear a wig on dates?

20:31.017 --> 20:33.434
(laughing):
Ow... my God.

20:34.142 --> 20:36.309
Okay, cool.
You're fucked up.

20:38.351 --> 20:40.975
(alarm blaring)

20:54.517 --> 20:55.934
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

20:56.017 --> 20:57.975
It's so fucking hot out.

20:58.768 --> 21:00.726
-Yeah.
-Wanna get out of here?

21:00.809 --> 21:02.643
Should we pay
for our drinks?

21:03.643 --> 21:04.601
Nah.

21:04.684 --> 21:06.934
-(tires screech)
-(gasps) Oh my God!

21:08.142 --> 21:09.601
(muffled):
Come on.

21:09.684 --> 21:11.267
God...

21:11.351 --> 21:14.142
Neil: (chuckles)
Close call.

21:14.684 --> 21:15.893
-Come on.
-Oh God.

21:17.893 --> 21:19.601
Darby:
Wait. Are you...?

21:19.684 --> 21:21.225
-All right.
-(laughing)

21:21.851 --> 21:23.059
Cab Driver:
Come on, bro. What the--

21:23.142 --> 21:25.392
(xylophone playing)

21:28.267 --> 21:29.559
-Ah!
-Ooh!

21:29.643 --> 21:33.768
-Play any instruments?
-Yeah, um, guitar, bass,

21:33.851 --> 21:35.851
cello, drums...

21:35.934 --> 21:38.434
-So you're like
a guy in a band?
-...piano.

21:38.517 --> 21:40.267
I am in a band.

21:40.351 --> 21:42.559
Oh, my God.
I knew you were in a band.

21:42.643 --> 21:43.684
I could smell it.

21:43.768 --> 21:45.434
You should come
to one of my gigs.

21:45.517 --> 21:47.017
Absolutely not.

21:47.100 --> 21:52.059
Listen, what is the craziest
thing you've ever done?

21:52.142 --> 21:53.601
Ooh, oh my God!

21:53.684 --> 21:55.434
Um...

21:56.893 --> 22:00.059
I was rafting
on this trip in Africa--

22:00.142 --> 22:02.142
-Blah!
-What?

22:02.225 --> 22:04.809
Being well-traveled
is not a personality.

22:04.893 --> 22:08.017
Famously not.
That's a rich person thing.

22:09.142 --> 22:11.559
-I'm a twin.
-Uh-huh.

22:14.559 --> 22:18.225
-I saved my brother's life
in the womb.
-Oh, yeah? How?

22:19.142 --> 22:23.184
-His amniotic sac
started leaking.
-Oh, his little sac?

22:23.267 --> 22:26.934
-Yes, his little baby sac
started leaking...
-Yeah. Right.

22:27.017 --> 22:30.059
...and the doctor was
telling my mom

22:30.142 --> 22:32.309
they might have to
sacrifice him for me.

22:32.392 --> 22:34.100
That if he survived,
he would have

22:34.184 --> 22:36.434
almost no chance
at a normal life.

22:37.059 --> 22:40.559
(chuckles)
They were telling her
all this terrible stuff,

22:40.643 --> 22:44.184
and while that was happening,
I got in front of the sac

22:44.267 --> 22:47.017
stopped the leak
long enough for them

22:47.100 --> 22:50.517
to deliver us super early.

22:50.601 --> 22:53.975
-Hmm.
-Three months early.
We were crazy premature.

22:54.059 --> 22:56.184
Tiny, like little
Beanie Babies.

22:56.267 --> 22:58.392
-Cute.
-(both laughing)

22:59.267 --> 23:00.643
And, uh...

23:02.601 --> 23:03.851
He survived.

23:03.934 --> 23:07.017
Just a slight walking
disability, but that was it.

23:07.100 --> 23:08.934
He was fine.

23:09.017 --> 23:10.726
Kind of weird, but he was fine.

23:10.809 --> 23:11.934
(chuckles)

23:13.017 --> 23:16.517
And then,
when we were 18,

23:17.975 --> 23:20.184
we snuck into a bar

23:21.059 --> 23:23.351
and we g-g-g, uh--

23:23.434 --> 23:24.934
got drunk.

23:27.476 --> 23:29.309
And I wrecked the car.

23:30.267 --> 23:32.142
(stuttering):
And he d--

23:35.184 --> 23:36.476
d--

23:54.351 --> 23:56.517
w(chuckling)

24:04.351 --> 24:05.559
Your turn.

24:07.351 --> 24:08.559
Man:
Excuse me.

24:10.559 --> 24:12.684
Can either of you
spare some change?

24:13.559 --> 24:15.476
I'm trying to get
something to eat.

24:15.559 --> 24:17.351
(indistinct chatter)

24:18.726 --> 24:20.726
Yep, get whatever you want, man.

24:21.059 --> 24:23.309
Can I get an Italian
on a hoagie?

24:23.392 --> 24:24.643
-You want something?
-No mayo.

24:24.726 --> 24:26.559
I don't know.

24:28.392 --> 24:29.975
-Man: Can I get
some dessert?
-Yeah, sure.

24:30.059 --> 24:31.351
All right, cool.

24:31.434 --> 24:32.559
Cool, cool.

24:36.559 --> 24:38.392
Man:
Yes, yes, yes.

24:39.684 --> 24:42.684
Clerk:
Italian hoagie,
no mayonesa. $9.75.

24:43.184 --> 24:45.267
(register beeping)

24:48.100 --> 24:49.975
(register beeps)

24:50.059 --> 24:52.392
Man:
Yes, yes, yes.

24:56.975 --> 24:58.726
Man:
What the fuck?

24:59.934 --> 25:02.059
Man:
Oh...

26:40.476 --> 26:41.975
ARTHUR: You've been in New York
for like a long time, right?

26:42.059 --> 26:45.517
Oh, yes, decades. You don't look
like a nudist to me.

26:46.893 --> 26:48.726
You should think about
making this a mobile dispensary.

26:48.809 --> 26:50.809
-I don't know.
-Hey! You wanna buy some weed?

26:51.059 --> 26:52.601
-All right.
-Someone'll be right down.

26:52.684 --> 26:54.100
Are you dining with us today?

26:54.601 --> 26:56.142
I hope you brought
your credit card.

26:56.225 --> 26:57.059
We're cashless.

26:57.142 --> 26:59.392
That hallway reeks!
Who's this?

26:59.476 --> 27:00.768
-Uh, it's-- This is, uh--
-I'm just gonna go.

27:00.851 --> 27:02.643
Your drug dealer?
Arthur, are you kidding me?

27:02.726 --> 27:04.184
I'll keep it in my room.
