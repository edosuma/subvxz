01:24.585 --> 01:28.425
Anyway... today I went
across the street to the Apple Store,

01:28.505 --> 01:31.220
and I got one of the new iPhones
with the 64-gigabytes,

01:31.300 --> 01:34.554
'cause I wasn't sure if I should get
the 16s or the 64s,

01:34.636 --> 01:37.476
but the 64s look good, so there you go.

01:37.556 --> 01:40.521
The genius bartender showed me
how to make things bigger,

01:40.601 --> 01:41.897
but I already forgot.

01:41.977 --> 01:44.066
God, my eyesight is so shot.

01:44.146 --> 01:46.985
But I got on Google before,
and I looked up my apartment,

01:47.065 --> 01:49.818
and it said they'd filmed The Hills
there for two seasons.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.490
Isn't that neat?

01:51.570 --> 01:56.245
And they used to do the Extra program
at The Grove every day with Mario Lopez.

01:56.325 --> 01:57.996
He seems nice.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.704
And who wouldn't love an outdoor mall?

02:00.787 --> 02:04.041
I can't believe it, me in Los Angeles.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.752
If only Daddy could see me now.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.675
Today they played "Come Fly With Me,"

02:09.755 --> 02:12.008
and I almost started crying,
thinking about him.

02:12.090 --> 02:14.805
But I didn't 'cause, basically,
I feel great.

02:14.885 --> 02:17.388
It's like living on Main Street
in Disneyland.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.643
Every day is sunny,
and I wake up and I think,

02:19.723 --> 02:22.521
"Thank you, Joey, for making it possible."

02:22.601 --> 02:27.107
I swear, if I get hit by that trolley,
I'll die happy.

02:27.189 --> 02:28.657
Just wait till you see my apartment.

02:31.818 --> 02:35.117
I have a balcony that's far enough away
from other people's balconies,

02:35.197 --> 02:38.161
so nobody could jump down
from the roof or whatever.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.706
And I have a parking spot
next to the elevator,

02:40.786 --> 02:43.164
so I can just run right in there.

02:44.206 --> 02:46.378
And I got everything shipped out
from Jersey,

02:46.458 --> 02:47.835
all my artwork,

02:47.918 --> 02:50.007
the doll I had made of you,

02:50.087 --> 02:53.260
and, of course, the pictures
of me and Daddy in his red car.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.554
God, we had the best times in that thing.

02:55.634 --> 02:58.478
Anyway, call me back. Love you.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.247
Oh, God...

03:27.165 --> 03:28.211
I brought you bagels.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.380
- You should have called.
- I did.

03:30.460 --> 03:31.461
But I didn't answer.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.513
Oh, I figured you were working
or something.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.383
Say hi to your grand-dogs.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.056
Hi, doggies. How you doing?

03:39.136 --> 03:41.138
Okay. Stay there.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.893
All right, bye.

03:42.973 --> 03:45.437
Six bagels, all salt.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.314
Those are the best kind.

03:47.394 --> 03:51.149
Oh, Lor, you let Daddy's bonsai die.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.734
Oh, yeah. Sorry, Ma.

03:53.817 --> 03:57.491
I tried, but they're, like,
crazy delicate.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.743
It was crazy.

03:59.698 --> 04:00.790
Sorry, Joey.

04:01.658 --> 04:04.831
See, this is why I asked you
not to put me in charge.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.501
You can't just leave someone
with a bonsai and orchid,

04:07.581 --> 04:09.169
and put all this pressure on them.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.462
You let the orchid die, too?

04:10.542 --> 04:12.339
I watered it every day.

04:12.419 --> 04:15.008
Well, Lori, you're not supposed
to water it every day.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.302
Well, I watered it the right amount, okay?

04:17.382 --> 04:20.055
Please, don't make me
feel any more bad about it.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.557
Okay, forget it.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.983
Oh, what's this?

04:27.309 --> 04:28.647
It's Emily's baby shower.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.354
Do you get to bring somebody?

04:31.021 --> 04:32.273
Why? I probably won't go.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.568
Why not?

04:33.648 --> 04:37.903
Because I'll have to get all dressed up,
and everyone I know will be there.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.327
I thought you gave up smoking.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.329
Cigarettes. You said this was better.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.207
I said it was okay after
your father died when your stomach hurt.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.211
Well, it's after my father died,
and my stomach hurts.

04:52.751 --> 04:55.048
Well, have you heard from Jacob?

04:55.128 --> 04:56.129
You shouldn't call him.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.386
What's going on at work?
Did they call you about the pilot?

04:59.466 --> 05:01.012
You shouldn't be smoking
if you have a deadline.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.931
Mom, don't say "deadline."

05:03.011 --> 05:07.266
Don't say "pilot," and please don't ever
say the word "Jacob" again.

05:07.349 --> 05:08.976
Okay.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.526
I just think you shouldn't call him.

05:14.606 --> 05:17.530
Especially if you have a deadline
for your pilot. Jacob... I mean, I just...

05:18.610 --> 05:20.282
I think we should get you a hobby.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.160
I thought you were gonna volunteer
at the hospital.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.704
Yeah, I've been meaning to do that.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.662
Or maybe you could be my hobby?

05:32.374 --> 05:35.547
And then, you just touch the screen
like that.

05:35.627 --> 05:38.300
Look how you magnified that. That's gre...

05:38.380 --> 05:41.595
Okay, say you wanna find an address
for a baby shower.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.847
Well, then you just open Safari here,

05:43.927 --> 05:45.429
- and then you type it in.
- Or Google it.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.389
Yeah, you Google it,
and if you ever need it again,

05:47.472 --> 05:48.724
it's right there in your search history.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.979
Oh, my God. Freddy, you are a genius.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.311
It's just a label.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.396
My daughter's a genius,
but she's too old for you.

05:54.479 --> 05:57.358
- How old are you?
- I'll be 23 in October.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.864
Get out of here. October...
That makes you a Libra, right?

06:00.944 --> 06:04.619
So scales, justice...
you're probably very diplomatic.

06:05.657 --> 06:06.783
You should be a lawyer.

06:08.285 --> 06:09.411
Maybe.

06:09.494 --> 06:12.043
You should be. You should.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.208
Oh, my God.

06:14.291 --> 06:15.292
No, no, no.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.501
I'm not even a candidate for Lasik.

06:16.585 --> 06:20.383
They said they had to slice my eyeball
open and put in a little... a lens.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.302
Well, you should get what I have.
Transitions.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.386
They go from regular glasses
to sunglasses when you walk outside.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.432
And you can get them anywhere.
LensCrafters.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.764
Want me to make you an appointment?

06:28.847 --> 06:30.269
You should try Zillow.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.815
They have a lot of places to rent and...
Or just get advice.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.983
I mean, that's how I found my condo.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.276
Zillow.

06:38.356 --> 06:41.571
What you have to do is have him
tip you upside down.

06:41.651 --> 06:44.370
That's what Joe and I did
to conceive Lori.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.124
- It'll be easy. She's so petite.
- Yeah.

06:49.576 --> 06:52.415
It's another pink bunny!

06:52.495 --> 06:54.998
I love it. What's next?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.252
Is this a baby monitor?

06:59.336 --> 07:02.300
It's from Mrs. Minervini.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.802
What is it?

07:03.882 --> 07:05.930
Oh, my God.

07:07.469 --> 07:09.391
It's an iPad.

07:09.471 --> 07:10.973
What? What?

07:11.056 --> 07:13.103
- Wow. Oh, my God.
- Marnie.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.397
This is crazy generous.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.479
- Well, I know it wasn't on your list.
- No.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.526
But, I was in the Apple store
the other day

07:19.606 --> 07:22.696
and I saw this little Filipino boy,
practically a baby,

07:22.776 --> 07:24.403
and he was playing with one of these...

07:24.486 --> 07:26.157
- I mean, what do you...
- iPad.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.201
iPad, yes. And then Freddy came over,

07:28.281 --> 07:31.000
and he told me
that you can load in programs...

07:31.952 --> 07:35.417
like Nemo and Barney's Circus...

07:35.497 --> 07:36.710
- Brilliant.
- Yes.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.088
Brilliant. Marnie, thank you.
This is so nice.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.215
Lori has the best mum ever.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.299
Apart from my mum. Did you get that down?

07:45.382 --> 07:46.759
- I'm gonna write it down.
- Write it down. Yeah.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.014
Hey, where is Lori?

07:49.094 --> 07:52.642
I think she's working. She had a deadline.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.060
I mean, a countdown.

07:54.140 --> 07:57.144
Yeah, she said
she'd watch Tehya for me tonight.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.355
Dani and I haven't been able to get
out in, like, a year.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.902
- Oh, I could do it.
- I thought she was out of town.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.403
She told me she was sick.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.155
Well, she was sick. She was.

08:05.235 --> 08:08.199
I'd be sick too with everything
Jacob puts her through.

08:08.279 --> 08:11.119
She's so pretty.
Why can't she just get over him?

08:11.199 --> 08:13.496
Well, he was the last person
to meet her dad.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.078
Oh, yeah, he really loved her dad.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.162
That's tough to get over.

08:16.246 --> 08:19.669
She's not gonna get over him
if she keeps giving him what he wants.

08:19.749 --> 08:20.750
What does he want?

08:20.834 --> 08:23.838
Oh, my God!

08:24.879 --> 08:26.217
I'm dying.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.261
What does he want?

08:28.341 --> 08:29.888
It wasn't on the list either.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.308
Marnie? Marnie?

08:33.388 --> 08:35.390
This is Greg's dad.

08:35.472 --> 08:37.562
He came out to help us with the nursery.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.736
- Marnie.
- Hi. Mark.

08:40.477 --> 08:43.277
- He's in town till Thursday, so...
- Yeah.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.074
She's a character, huh?

08:49.237 --> 08:50.238
Well...

08:50.321 --> 08:53.286
So you came out, to see your son?

08:53.366 --> 08:56.119
Yeah, Emily said it was
very important that I come,

08:56.202 --> 08:58.421
but I think I'm just here to carry gifts.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.754
Yeah. Well, his mother's
not around anymore, so...

09:02.834 --> 09:04.798
My husband died a year ago.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.675
Oh, she's alive. She lives in London.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.093
But, you know, we're divorced.

09:08.173 --> 09:09.174
Oh, sorry.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.765
Emily tells me you grew up in Brooklyn?

09:13.845 --> 09:15.472
- Yeah.
- Which... which part?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.478
Sunset Park.

09:18.892 --> 09:22.816
I grew up on the corner of 48th
and 7th Avenue, right by the church.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.567
- Get outta here.
- Yeah.

09:24.647 --> 09:28.571
I grew up at 43rd and 4th,
by the other church.

09:28.651 --> 09:31.950
Yeah. We used to go to the public pool
there, before it became a parking lot.

09:32.030 --> 09:34.533
Get out of here,
I went there all the time!

09:35.241 --> 09:37.539
I'll bet we moved in similar circles.

09:37.619 --> 09:40.709
Oh, absolutely. That's crazy.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.502
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's funny.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.085
Hey, you know, before I leave town,

09:45.168 --> 09:48.258
we should go have lunch, you know,
with the girls.

09:48.338 --> 09:53.138
Or, there's this holocaust museum
I've been really wanting to check out.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.970
Have you been to the holocaust museum?

09:55.053 --> 09:58.143
No. It sounds like fun, but I can't.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.562
I really can't
because I've just moved in, you know.

10:00.642 --> 10:03.815
I've got all my paperwork I gotta do,
and, you know...

10:03.895 --> 10:06.317
Plus, I'm volunteering at the hospital,

10:06.397 --> 10:08.194
and I might also be babysitting.

10:08.274 --> 10:11.614
I'm not sure, but it looks
like pretty soon I might be babysitting.

10:11.694 --> 10:14.243
But I've never been so busy.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.118
Okay, so I'm just calling

10:18.201 --> 10:21.416
to tell you that I'm on my way
to the hospital to volunteer.

10:21.496 --> 10:24.210
And so, call me back and, soon,

10:24.290 --> 10:26.838
because once I get in there, then,
I mean, I'll be in there

10:26.918 --> 10:28.795
and you won't be able to reach me. So...

10:28.878 --> 10:31.718
Oh, and did I tell you
about this new Beyoncé song?

10:31.798 --> 10:33.015
Listen to this.

10:36.511 --> 10:39.139
Yeah? Right? So, anyway, yeah.

10:39.222 --> 10:41.475
So call me soon
because once I get in there,

10:41.558 --> 10:43.897
then you won't be able to reach me. Okay.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.275
So, bye. Call me.

11:04.414 --> 11:07.293
...discovered in the Angeles
National Forest within ten miles

11:07.375 --> 11:09.547
of where the skeletal remains were found.

11:09.627 --> 11:13.051
Police suspect this could be the work
of a serial killer that's been targeting

11:13.131 --> 11:15.720
young women in the area since 2005.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.802
Well, we've got dangerous riptides
in Malibu.

11:17.886 --> 11:20.183
What do you need to know if you're
headed to the beach this weekend?

11:20.263 --> 11:22.265
Well, it may be sunny...

11:23.308 --> 11:25.105
Lor?

11:25.185 --> 11:26.812
Lori?

11:26.895 --> 11:29.523
Don't you bring your mail in anymore?

11:29.606 --> 11:31.529
Lor.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.698
Lori?

11:36.988 --> 11:39.241
You're not bringing the mail in?

11:40.116 --> 11:41.117
Jesus.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.998
Mom! You have to ring the doorbell.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.166
But I've got the key.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.793
Well, what if I had company?

11:46.873 --> 11:48.716
You mean like Jacob?

11:49.417 --> 11:50.505
Who told you that?

11:50.585 --> 11:52.053
Your friends at the baby shower.

11:54.255 --> 11:57.679
Mom, please don't talk to my friends,
okay?

11:57.759 --> 12:01.975
And you're not supposed to go as a
"plus one" if there isn't a one to plus.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.769
But you never told me
if you were going or not.

12:04.849 --> 12:07.814
Oh, did you get my message
about the serial killer?

12:07.894 --> 12:11.568
The guy that's going all around Southern
California targeting young women?

12:11.648 --> 12:13.901
Well, we should be fine, then.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.906
Well, I was thinking that we should
get a system in place where

12:16.986 --> 12:19.534
every time you're leaving the house,
you call me,

12:19.614 --> 12:22.078
and then you text me when you're home.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.997
That's crazy.

12:24.077 --> 12:27.625
Well, I just mean until, you know,
until they catch the guy.

12:27.705 --> 12:30.503
And if you run into him,
you know what you're supposed to do.

12:30.583 --> 12:34.053
It's, like, eyes, throat, crotch.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.964
Crotch.

12:36.047 --> 12:40.013
Mom, maybe you shouldn't drop
around here all the time.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.187
But I barely see you anymore.

12:43.346 --> 12:47.852
Well, you know,
I've got a ton of work to do, so...

12:47.934 --> 12:51.484
you know, it requires a lot of research.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.194
I'm just saying,

12:54.274 --> 12:58.198
I'm not in the position
to be very entertaining right now.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.030
I don't have any good stories.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.786
Is there anything you wanna talk about?

13:03.408 --> 13:06.582
Didn't you hear what I just said?

13:07.954 --> 13:10.668
What I need right now is to write.

13:10.748 --> 13:11.920
Okay?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.464
This is my office.

13:14.544 --> 13:15.590
This is my desk.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.759
These are my co-workers.

13:17.839 --> 13:22.305
If I was in a real office,
you wouldn't come in and sit on my desk,

13:22.385 --> 13:24.349
and pet my co-workers, would you?

13:24.429 --> 13:26.056
No?

13:30.059 --> 13:34.275
I've been talking to my therapist
about this, and...

13:34.355 --> 13:39.828
I think it's time that we...
set some boundaries.

13:41.446 --> 13:42.948
Sure.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.533
Yep.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.413
I get it.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.831
You need to write...

13:48.911 --> 13:51.125
and I need to...

13:51.205 --> 13:53.128
get out of your office.

13:55.126 --> 13:56.878
But you don't have to leave right now.

13:56.961 --> 14:01.137
No, it's fine. It's fine. I don't want
to be crossing anybody's boundaries.

14:04.469 --> 14:07.934
I don't know.
She seems so angry all the time.

14:08.014 --> 14:11.484
You've been seeing her for a while.
Has she always seemed so angry?

14:16.522 --> 14:18.194
And I just, I don't...

14:18.274 --> 14:20.947
I don't want her to hurt herself
or anything.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.615
I mean, does she talk to you about that?

14:22.695 --> 14:24.742
I'm not saying that I want to know
what she says.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.950
I'm just saying that
if she talks to you about stuff,

14:27.033 --> 14:28.454
I hope she talks to you about that stuff,

14:28.534 --> 14:30.081
and that you talk to her about that stuff,

14:30.161 --> 14:33.459
and that you make sure
she doesn't hurt herself or anything.

14:33.539 --> 14:37.669
And, you know, maybe also tell her
to stop smoking so much grass.

14:37.752 --> 14:42.927
I know she's in...
some stage of grief or something, but...

14:43.007 --> 14:45.930
- And what about you?
- What about me?

14:46.010 --> 14:47.011
How do you feel?

14:47.095 --> 14:50.893
Well, I feel she should find some other
way to feel better besides marijuana.

14:50.973 --> 14:54.568
No, I mean how do you feel
since your husband died?

15:00.066 --> 15:03.696
Well, of course I feel sad.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.536
But I don't think I'm as stressed as Lori,

15:08.616 --> 15:11.414
because I don't have to worry
about my career or money.

15:11.494 --> 15:13.872
Because Joey, God bless him,
he set me up for life.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.582
So I can do...

15:15.665 --> 15:17.042
I can do anything.

15:17.125 --> 15:20.755
I mean, like, when I go
to an action movie, I get three tickets,

15:20.837 --> 15:23.551
one for me, one for Joe,
one for my mother.

15:23.631 --> 15:26.305
And I don't even have to think about it.
I don't have to worry about it.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.226
I spend...

15:32.306 --> 15:33.933
a lot of time by myself.

15:34.892 --> 15:37.896
And, well, there are a lot of hours
in the day

15:37.979 --> 15:41.779
and so sometimes I don't know what to do
with them, and I call Lori...

15:42.525 --> 15:44.072
but she...

15:44.152 --> 15:45.529
Well, she doesn't...

15:45.611 --> 15:47.408
She doesn't want my advice or anything.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.115
I mean, I have nothing...

15:50.241 --> 15:52.164
important to say.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.336
But basically, I feel great.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.669
I love my apartment.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.007
You can't beat this weather.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.675
And who doesn't love The Grove?

16:04.755 --> 16:07.383
I mean, it's like living on Main Street
in Disneyland.

16:38.623 --> 16:41.671
Anyway, call me and let me
know you got in safe.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.970
Oh, and remind me to tell you
what your therapist said.

16:47.548 --> 16:51.347
...very little information about the
message left behind by the serial killer

16:51.427 --> 16:53.555
who is asking to be called
the "Red Ripper."

17:34.554 --> 17:37.977
It's so good to see you out of the house,

17:38.057 --> 17:40.230
and on such a nice occasion.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.192
Pretzel bread!

17:48.276 --> 17:50.324
Reminds me of my father... Well, pretzels.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.489
So good.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.245
So, listen, Mom,

17:56.325 --> 17:59.165
I have to go to New York for a few weeks
to shoot the pilot.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.042
New York? Why?

18:01.122 --> 18:03.961
Well, 'cause the show is set there,
so it's, it's actually good,

18:04.041 --> 18:07.882
but I'm not gonna be reachable
for a few weeks,

18:07.962 --> 18:09.050
like, at all.

18:09.130 --> 18:12.259
Like, somebody else is gonna be
holding my phone for me.

18:12.341 --> 18:15.014
But I was thinking at the end

18:15.094 --> 18:17.266
if you wanted to come and visit the set

18:17.346 --> 18:21.145
and we could finally think about

18:21.225 --> 18:23.189
getting a headstone for Dad,

18:23.269 --> 18:26.148
or, you know, at least figure out
what to do with his ashes.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.194
Yeah, well, we don't have to talk
about it now.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.738
We can wait until, you know,
before you go and then...

18:30.818 --> 18:32.615
I leave tomorrow.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.038
Tomorrow?

18:35.906 --> 18:37.245
That's really soon.

18:37.325 --> 18:41.330
I know. But maybe you could come over
tonight and help me pack,

18:41.412 --> 18:44.416
and maybe even crash so you could
give me a ride to the airport tomorrow?

18:44.498 --> 18:46.963
- That'd be fun.
- How about if I go with you?

18:47.043 --> 18:49.922
If I go with you,
I could be like your assistant.

18:50.004 --> 18:51.842
No, no.

18:51.922 --> 18:54.512
I think, if anything, I'd need you here,

18:54.592 --> 18:58.768
you know, to watch the house
and look after your grand-dogs.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.317
It's my job, Mom.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.691
Yeah, yeah. Sure, you're right.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.523
You're right. It's great.
It's a good idea.

19:09.732 --> 19:10.733
It's a good opportunity.

19:10.816 --> 19:11.988
- It is, you know.
- It's good.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.407
And it's really good timing for me,
you know?

19:14.487 --> 19:18.786
I can get out of town and be busy,
and finally take my mind off things.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.994
- Jacob!
- Exactly.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.169
Excuse me, can I get a picture with you?

19:27.249 --> 19:28.501
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

19:29.251 --> 19:31.173
Thank you so much.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.756
Hey, you two.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.261
Hey, you two!

19:35.341 --> 19:37.179
- Hi.
- Hey, Marnie.

19:37.259 --> 19:40.559
Jacob, it's good to see you. You know,
I never said anything bad about you.

19:42.056 --> 19:44.353
- You know, Elise, right?
- Yes.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.401
- Yeah.
- How are you doing?

19:47.520 --> 19:50.067
Well, we don't want to interrupt your,
your girl time.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.194
No! No, no, it's fine.

19:52.274 --> 19:55.448
We're just doing a drive-by
until I go out later.

19:55.528 --> 19:58.782
I didn't want her to have to spend
Valentine's Day alone.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.741
I didn't want her to spend it alone,
either.

20:00.825 --> 20:03.039
- I'm not alone.
- No. We're together.

20:03.119 --> 20:04.665
Until later,
when I'm meeting other people.

20:04.745 --> 20:07.543
- I thought we were having a sleepover?
- No.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.593
That's so cute!
I wish my mom and I were that close.

20:11.669 --> 20:14.047
Well, maybe, when you get older.

20:19.427 --> 20:20.804
What would make you happy?

20:20.886 --> 20:24.140
If I could be stuffed into a cannon
and shot into outer space.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.816
Should we go get milkshakes?

20:26.809 --> 20:28.856
I'm going to kill myself.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.900
- Don't say that.
- I can't live here anymore.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.357
There's no safe place.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.529
I mean, just when I want to hit
the eject button, you move here.

20:35.609 --> 20:36.697
What does that mean?

20:36.777 --> 20:39.405
It means that I tried to book a session
with my therapist

20:39.488 --> 20:43.118
to talk about my mother and I couldn't
because my mother was there!

20:43.200 --> 20:45.915
You told me to go talk to her
after Daddy died, so...

20:45.995 --> 20:47.458
Do you understand?

20:47.538 --> 20:50.667
Eighty percent of the time
the phone rings, it's you!

20:50.750 --> 20:55.091
The phone rings and I think it
could be a job, or a guy, or a friend,

20:55.171 --> 20:58.969
and it's my mother!
Almost every single time.

20:59.049 --> 21:02.178
Do you understand how terrible
that makes me feel?

21:03.554 --> 21:05.267
I can call less.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.769
I can. I can just...

21:06.849 --> 21:09.443
Well, like if you don't get back to me,
I'll just text.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.277
I'm never gonna get over him.

21:15.357 --> 21:16.734
How can I help? What can I do?

21:16.817 --> 21:18.364
Nothing.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.866
Well, then who are you texting?
Don't act out.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.825
I need to have sex with someone else,
and you can't be here for it.

21:23.908 --> 21:25.910
Okay, but just not Jacob.

21:25.993 --> 21:29.998
Please, Mom, I can't do this anymore.
I need to get a life of my own, okay?

21:30.080 --> 21:31.297
And so do you!

21:36.212 --> 21:38.681
I still need a ride to the airport.

21:44.345 --> 21:45.766
You have everything?

21:45.846 --> 21:47.348
I have no idea.

21:49.892 --> 21:52.982
Passengers only. No parking.

21:53.062 --> 21:55.110
- Love you.
- Love you.

22:30.599 --> 22:34.069
Blue team to ICU, please. Blue team, ICU.

22:49.618 --> 22:53.168
Hi. Hello.

22:55.708 --> 23:00.007
You all by yourself,
because your thing's beeping.

23:00.087 --> 23:02.556
There's nobody with you?

23:04.675 --> 23:07.598
I think, maybe, you got tangled.

23:07.678 --> 23:09.055
Let me look.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.890
I don't know.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.601
The wires or something here?

23:15.394 --> 23:18.273
There you go. See? Is that better?

23:18.355 --> 23:19.857
You seem like you...

23:20.941 --> 23:25.071
Okay. Well, I'll go get somebody
that knows what they're doing.

23:25.821 --> 23:30.418
You can keep the little bunny.
He likes it there.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.460
The woman in 317, she's in pain.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.843
Marnie, hi! What are you doing here?

23:43.923 --> 23:45.925
You said you needed a babysitter.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.429
I brought bagels.

23:47.509 --> 23:49.887
Oh, come in, please.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.273
All salt.

23:54.516 --> 23:57.690
You know what nobody ever tells you
is how lonely it is.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.398
I swear, I feel like there are some days

24:00.481 --> 24:03.985
where I go an entire day
without seeing another grown person.

24:04.068 --> 24:08.242
Like, by the time Dani gets home I don't
even know how to shut off the baby-talk.

24:08.322 --> 24:09.994
That is so normal.

24:10.074 --> 24:11.662
- Really?
- Really.

24:11.742 --> 24:14.164
But, you know, you have to remember
that she's gonna grow up.

24:14.244 --> 24:16.667
She's not gonna stay a little kid forever.

24:16.747 --> 24:18.711
And then you'll be having
real conversations.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.010
You'll talk about everything,
the way me and Lori do.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.341
Yeah, I know. Well, you're right, I know.

24:24.421 --> 24:28.301
God, I don't know why I'm so worried
about, like, doing it right.

24:28.384 --> 24:31.137
I... I lost my mom when I was young,

24:31.220 --> 24:34.268
so I'm... I'm flying blind.

24:34.348 --> 24:36.726
Lori told me something about that.
I'm sorry.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.563
But you can call me anytime to babysit
if you want.

24:41.480 --> 24:46.071
God, Lori is so lucky to have you
so close if she ever has kids.

24:46.151 --> 24:48.574
My dad couldn't even fly in
for my fake wedding.

24:48.654 --> 24:50.907
You know, I had to walk myself
down the aisle.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.329
Why was your wedding fake?

24:53.409 --> 24:56.413
Oh, because, yeah, it was at city hall.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.248
And, like, we'd just found out
the adoption was going through.

24:59.331 --> 25:02.922
And so, you know, I convinced myself
I just wanted a quickie wedding,

25:03.002 --> 25:05.255
and then I thought we'd have
a real wedding once Tehya came home,

25:05.337 --> 25:09.511
but now it just...
It feels selfish to spend any money

25:09.591 --> 25:12.556
I'd spend on her on, like,
giving us a special day, so...

25:12.636 --> 25:15.014
But what about Dani, is he working?

25:15.097 --> 25:17.394
Oh, she. Yeah, she's a chef at Bouchon,

25:17.474 --> 25:21.104
but she's, like, fifth in line
and works crazy hours.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.814
She does.

25:28.235 --> 25:30.074
What if I gave you the money?

25:30.154 --> 25:31.531
- What?
- Yeah.

25:31.613 --> 25:34.366
You know, I can gift a certain amount
of money every year to a person

25:34.450 --> 25:36.997
without having to pay taxes, and I...

25:37.077 --> 25:40.581
I don't know if it's gonna be enough
for your dream wedding, but $13,000...

25:40.664 --> 25:43.629
- Marnie, that's crazy.
- No. What's crazy?

25:43.709 --> 25:47.049
I have it, you need it. I mean, you just
don't want to leave it sitting around.

25:47.129 --> 25:50.302
Well, no. You should save it.
Spend it on yourself.

25:50.382 --> 25:53.010
I mean, wouldn't Lori be upset?

25:53.093 --> 25:55.057
Why? She's not getting married.

25:55.137 --> 25:57.481
Why would you even want to do that?

25:58.307 --> 26:02.733
It's romantic and, you know,
renewing your vows.

26:03.854 --> 26:05.731
Joe and I talked about that.

26:07.483 --> 26:09.110
Who doesn't love love?

26:10.277 --> 26:12.029
Oh, my God! Marnie!

26:12.112 --> 26:13.283
This is amazing!

26:13.363 --> 26:16.328
I mean, well, obviously, you're gonna be
involved in all of the planning.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.080
Only whatever you want me to be part of.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.582
- What do you think you want?
- Oh, my God.

26:20.662 --> 26:22.501
Nothing, like, extravagant.

26:22.581 --> 26:26.130
Dani was in the navy,
so maybe like a nautical theme.

26:26.210 --> 26:29.133
You could wear a little sailor dress
and he... she could wear her uniform.

26:29.213 --> 26:31.966
And it would be like
Officer and a Gentleman.

26:34.343 --> 26:36.890
Or you could do it on a submarine.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.223
Well, I don't see any submarines for rent,

26:39.306 --> 26:41.979
but there are a bunch of boats
at the Yacht Club in Marina Del Rey.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.731
That you can rent for a party?

26:43.811 --> 26:45.733
Yeah, looks like it.

26:45.813 --> 26:47.611
Freddy, you are a genius.

26:49.108 --> 26:52.863
Oh, jeez. It's $10,000 just for the venue.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.114
Look at that.

26:55.197 --> 26:57.450
I should get one of these for my daughter.

26:57.533 --> 27:00.036
Here, why don't you ring me up
another iPad?

27:00.119 --> 27:02.121
Yeah, sure.

27:03.747 --> 27:06.920
You know, I decided to take your advice.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.714
You're gonna be a lawyer?

27:08.794 --> 27:10.966
Well, no. But I am going to school.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.342
I mean, it's night school,

27:12.422 --> 27:15.676
but maybe engineering or programming,
or something.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.056
See how far I can get.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.224
And work's gonna pay for it, so...

27:19.304 --> 27:21.769
Oh, Freddy, you took my advice.

27:21.849 --> 27:26.229
Yeah, now all I have to do is figure out
my work schedule and the bus schedule.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.563
You don't have a car?

27:27.646 --> 27:30.819
Nah, my mom uses it for work, but it's
okay. I don't mind taking a bus.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.571
Meet a lot of freaky people on there.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.239
No, I could drive you. When?

27:34.319 --> 27:35.365
What are you talking about?

27:35.445 --> 27:37.948
I'm in the neighborhood, you're always
helping me out all the time.

27:38.031 --> 27:40.784
This will be my chance to pay you back.

27:40.868 --> 27:42.996
Oh, my God.
Do we have to take the freeway?

27:43.078 --> 27:45.501
I mean, we could avoid it,
but are you sure?

27:45.581 --> 27:47.294
- I mean, it's kind of late.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:47.374 --> 27:49.838
No, no, I... Don't worry about it.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.592
I don't sleep much.

28:33.420 --> 28:34.922
What?

28:35.923 --> 28:37.925
Cut! Cut!

28:38.008 --> 28:40.222
Hey, are you...
Are you supposed to be here?

28:40.302 --> 28:42.020
Here? Okay.

28:42.763 --> 28:45.602
Background, cross over,
talk to the woman in the blue hat.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.354
Okay?

28:47.434 --> 28:50.028
Yeah, killing the flowers.
Take that from you.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.981
Okay, losing the sweater.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.157
Losing the sweater.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.781
- Sorry about that.
- Take your time, Chance.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.324
Okay. Great.

28:59.404 --> 29:02.369
Great. All right!

29:02.449 --> 29:03.826
We're gonna go again!

29:05.869 --> 29:06.995
Mark.

29:07.871 --> 29:09.498
All right, background!

29:11.208 --> 29:13.711
Action!

29:13.794 --> 29:15.171
Hi.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.722
Anyways, I was just walking...

29:17.756 --> 29:19.554
So, we do it this way...

29:27.307 --> 29:28.308
Cut!

29:28.392 --> 29:30.105
- Anyway...
- Background!

29:30.185 --> 29:33.358
...the craziest thing happened.
You would not believe.

29:33.438 --> 29:37.362
I wandered onto a Hollywood movie set
and ended up being a part of the action.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.531
Isn't that wild?

29:39.611 --> 29:44.082
They say movie stars aren't nice people,
but they really are.

29:50.205 --> 29:51.957
Half-day today?

29:55.085 --> 29:58.675
I don't think I'll go back,
but I'm glad I did it.

29:58.755 --> 30:02.259
Then three nights a week I take Freddy
to his class and we talk the whole way.

30:02.342 --> 30:04.219
And they're alive when he scalps them.

30:04.303 --> 30:07.017
- No way.
- And then, he eats their brains.

30:07.097 --> 30:09.561
Oh, no! That's sick!

30:09.641 --> 30:10.687
- I know.
- That's sick!

30:10.767 --> 30:11.813
I know. I know.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.520
- Three, two, one.
- And I've been having a great time

30:13.603 --> 30:15.192
doing wedding plans with what's-her-name.

30:15.272 --> 30:16.273
Oh, my God!

30:18.066 --> 30:21.240
She seems really excited
and loves all my ideas.

30:21.320 --> 30:25.450
And I know who the flower girl is.

30:25.532 --> 30:26.703
Oh, I wonder who?

30:26.783 --> 30:29.373
And I've been really getting
into volunteering at the hospital.

30:29.453 --> 30:31.956
You should come down here with me
sometime and meet the staff.

30:32.039 --> 30:34.167
And not married. That's so funny.

30:34.249 --> 30:36.296
My daughter's not married, either.

30:36.376 --> 30:40.092
Anyway, I just wanted you to know that
I'm keeping busy with all my stuff

30:40.172 --> 30:41.969
and, basically, I feel great.

30:42.049 --> 30:45.472
So, give me a call and, let me
know you're safe and sound.

30:45.552 --> 30:48.267
And I hope you're not thinking
about Jacob too much.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.600
Love you... Hello, is...

30:51.558 --> 30:55.023
- Is that you? Hello?
- Marnie, is that you?

30:55.103 --> 30:56.195
It's Tony.

30:56.980 --> 31:00.445
I'm here with Cos and Dominic
and we all wanted to say hi.

31:00.525 --> 31:03.153
- Here, talk to Dom.
- Hey, Marnie, how are you?

31:03.236 --> 31:04.738
Hey, Dom. How are you feeling?

31:04.821 --> 31:07.035
Are you coming back to Jersey
for Joe's anniversary?

31:07.115 --> 31:10.789
Yeah, sure, but maybe not
actually on the actual day.

31:10.869 --> 31:15.124
I have to get settled first and then
as soon as I feel a bit more settled

31:15.207 --> 31:17.796
then I'm gonna come and, you know,
I'll book a flight

31:17.876 --> 31:20.048
and then I'll come see you guys.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.380
How's Ange? How's she doing?

31:21.463 --> 31:23.552
She's good, she's good.
Yeah, you want to talk to her? Angie!

31:23.632 --> 31:25.345
No, if she's busy, it's okay.

31:25.425 --> 31:27.764
- Don't...
- Marnie, where are you?

31:27.844 --> 31:29.308
When are you coming to visit?

31:29.388 --> 31:30.809
Soon. I just...

31:30.889 --> 31:33.562
Right now I just have
an awful lot on my plate, so...

31:33.642 --> 31:37.190
Have you thought about what kind
of a headstone you want to get for Joe?

31:37.270 --> 31:41.150
We were talking and Tony thought
it should have a quote on it.

31:43.902 --> 31:47.075
Just... I'm really busy right now,
you know.

31:47.155 --> 31:48.994
I'm planning a wedding
and I'm dog-sitting.

31:49.074 --> 31:51.413
And then, then I have this friend
that I'm driving places.

31:51.493 --> 31:52.745
And so it's, it's...

31:52.828 --> 31:55.167
You know, I really got a lot going...

31:55.247 --> 31:57.544
Oh, shoot, Ange, I just...

31:57.624 --> 32:01.504
There's a problem I got to fix,
so, you know, can I call you back?

32:01.586 --> 32:03.213
I'll call you back, okay. Bye.

32:13.515 --> 32:16.394
You don't have to say anything
if you don't want to.

32:18.103 --> 32:20.356
Is it something that happened at work?

32:20.439 --> 32:22.316
He just always does this to me.

32:22.399 --> 32:24.946
- Your boss?
- No. No, my brother.

32:25.026 --> 32:27.616
He sends this e-mail saying
he wants to see me.

32:27.696 --> 32:30.243
I'm not even talking to him,
but he's still telling me what to do.

32:30.323 --> 32:31.620
Why aren't you talking to him?

32:31.700 --> 32:32.996
He's always getting me in trouble.

32:33.076 --> 32:35.123
It's the same thing since we were kids.

32:35.203 --> 32:38.753
As soon as I get something good going,
he goes and just tries to wreck it.

32:43.420 --> 32:47.300
You know, Freddy, sometimes a person
seems like they don't really care,

32:47.382 --> 32:51.012
but really they're just
not as strong as you are.

32:51.094 --> 32:56.521
I bet your mother would be really happy
if you gave him another chance.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.689
Anyway, thanks.

33:07.652 --> 33:10.121
Be extraordinary!

33:11.448 --> 33:14.201
I just... I will wear anything,
but I do not look good in strapless.

33:14.284 --> 33:18.164
No. I mean, I don't look good
in anything, so I don't know.

33:18.246 --> 33:20.544
That's crazy. But everybody
looks good in a wrap dress.

33:20.624 --> 33:23.463
Excuse me, how many bridesmaids are there?

33:23.543 --> 33:27.467
Oh, well, there's me,
Emily, Trish, Stacy, Casey.

33:27.547 --> 33:31.138
- Wow.
- Katie M., Katie P., Molly,

33:31.218 --> 33:34.182
- Gina, Amy, Fern...
- Fern.

33:34.262 --> 33:36.101
Oh, and Wendy.

33:36.181 --> 33:37.853
Who am I forgetting?

33:37.933 --> 33:40.647
Oh, Lori. If she's even in town.

33:40.727 --> 33:42.065
- Oh, she'll be there.
- Are you sure?

33:42.145 --> 33:44.943
'Cause the dresses are color-coordinated
and we need an odd number.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.775
She'll be there. I'll make sure.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.111
- Okay.
- Did you really book Blues Traveler?

33:49.194 --> 33:52.198
The guy with the harmonica? Yeah.
He's fantastic.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.157
- Very cool.
- Yeah, really cool.

33:54.241 --> 33:55.242
Okay, you guys...

33:57.536 --> 33:59.163
- That's it.
- It's really white.

33:59.246 --> 34:00.917
This is the one.

34:00.997 --> 34:02.499
I could murder you.

34:02.582 --> 34:03.708
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

34:03.792 --> 34:06.921
- You look so skinny.
- Okay.

34:07.003 --> 34:09.505
Well, no, don't fall so in love yet,
because I'm actually,

34:09.589 --> 34:11.091
I'm not gonna get this exact dress,

34:11.174 --> 34:12.551
but I am gonna copy the design

34:12.634 --> 34:15.012
and buy cheaper fabric,
and then have it made at half the price.

34:15.094 --> 34:16.391
Oh, Jesus.

34:16.471 --> 34:19.520
You look so beautiful.

34:20.516 --> 34:22.731
- I'm so happy for her.
- Are you okay?

34:22.811 --> 34:25.313
- Don't do this.
- She's so skinny. She looks fantastic.

34:25.397 --> 34:26.485
- Don't do that.
- Happy for her?

34:26.565 --> 34:28.904
- No, I'm really happy for her.
- Do you really love it?

34:28.984 --> 34:31.987
Oh, Marnie, of course, but, you know...

34:32.070 --> 34:33.617
She looks great. She looks really lovely.

34:34.155 --> 34:35.281
- What...
- No!

34:35.364 --> 34:37.078
What did... No! What did you do?

34:37.158 --> 34:40.036
- What?
- Marnie! No, Marnie!

34:40.120 --> 34:41.621
- Oh, my God!
- No, you should have it.

34:41.705 --> 34:45.170
Okay, I know you're not my birth mother,
but will you please be my earth mother?

34:45.250 --> 34:46.963
- No!
- What!

34:47.043 --> 34:49.591
My mom's not dead,
but will you be mine, too?

34:49.670 --> 34:52.174
- And mine, please!
- Mine, too!

34:58.847 --> 35:02.521
Anyway, I just wanted to make sure
you're gonna be back in time

35:02.601 --> 35:05.398
for what's-her-name's wedding. I don't
think you're gonna want to miss it.

35:05.478 --> 35:07.776
For making squished sandwiches with it...

35:07.856 --> 35:10.195
- Oh, paninis.
- Paninis, yeah.

35:10.275 --> 35:13.028
It's gonna be the party of the century.

35:13.111 --> 35:16.451
So hopefully, you don't have to do
re-shoots or whatever.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.533
Anyway, I hope you're having fun.

35:18.617 --> 35:21.211
I'm kind of dying
to find out how it's going.

35:22.078 --> 35:25.252
I miss you, but, basically, I feel fine.

35:25.332 --> 35:29.678
So, give me a call, but if you can't...

35:32.922 --> 35:34.261
What the hell, lady?

35:34.341 --> 35:36.435
Okay. Love you.

35:43.975 --> 35:47.566
And then I realized that
Freddy didn't have anyone to study with.

35:47.646 --> 35:53.071
So, I found out what classes he was
taking and what books he needed,

35:53.151 --> 35:55.865
and I got them on Amazon, half-price.

35:55.945 --> 35:58.198
So now, I can help him study.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.079
Why do you think you're helping him?

36:01.159 --> 36:04.914
Well, he comes from a poor neighborhood,
his mother works all the time,

36:04.996 --> 36:09.170
and, you know, education is
the most important thing to him.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.628
- And Jillian?
- Jillian?

36:11.711 --> 36:14.759
Well, Jillian, she never had
a proper lesbian wedding.

36:14.839 --> 36:17.512
And... I had the money

36:17.592 --> 36:20.516
and so I thought, "I can do that."

36:21.721 --> 36:22.938
What's Jillian's last name?

36:25.809 --> 36:27.436
Begins with a "G"...

36:28.478 --> 36:29.479
or a "K".

36:29.562 --> 36:31.030
It's a consonant.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.988
- A consonant.
- A consonant.

36:35.318 --> 36:36.319
Marnie?

36:36.403 --> 36:39.075
Do you think there's a part of you

36:39.155 --> 36:41.829
that maybe feels guilty that
you have your husband's money?

36:43.326 --> 36:45.203
Like you've been given
this consolation prize...

36:46.037 --> 36:48.381
you don't know what to do with?

36:49.833 --> 36:51.085
Or maybe there's a part of you...

36:52.669 --> 36:55.923
that feels like maybe money
is the way to save everybody.

36:56.005 --> 37:00.347
Or possibly even a way to stay
in people's lives and be needed?

37:00.427 --> 37:06.184
And that this relationship that you
have with Freddy and Jillian,

37:06.266 --> 37:10.066
it's really all about just replacing
your own husband and daughter?

37:11.604 --> 37:15.528
So I told her,
"I don't need to replace anyone."

37:15.608 --> 37:18.111
And why would I feel guilty
about Joe's money?

37:18.194 --> 37:20.697
I mean, he started out from nothing.
He worked hard all his life.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.994
He would have wanted me
to do something good with it, right?

37:23.074 --> 37:24.496
Like Cinderella.

37:26.453 --> 37:29.167
But she kept asking me all these questions

37:29.247 --> 37:30.999
and saying all this stuff.

37:31.082 --> 37:34.256
And I was like, "You're a therapist.
Aren't you supposed to listen?"

37:36.796 --> 37:38.469
Anyways...

37:40.175 --> 37:43.850
You know, this is one of
the best hospitals in the country.

39:00.296 --> 39:02.635
Look at this! Is this yours?

39:02.715 --> 39:05.555
No. Well, it was my husband's.
So, yeah, I guess it is.

39:05.635 --> 39:07.763
Got room for one more?

39:07.846 --> 39:10.599
Marnie, this is my brother, Fredo.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.811
Yeah. Well, oh, my.

39:13.893 --> 39:15.106
So nice to meet you.

39:15.186 --> 39:18.941
I kinda promised him we'd give him
a ride someplace. Is that cool?

39:19.023 --> 39:21.488
Actually, I have one stop to make first.

39:21.568 --> 39:22.694
Oh, sure, sure.

39:22.777 --> 39:25.155
Any brother of Freddy's
is a friend of mine.

39:25.238 --> 39:26.615
Shotgun!

39:28.199 --> 39:29.871
Hey, does the top come down on this thing?

39:29.951 --> 39:31.372
- Sure.
- Yeah.

39:31.452 --> 39:33.580
See, this the kinda car I want.

39:33.663 --> 39:36.878
Except I'll paint mine black,
you know, like a matte black.

39:36.958 --> 39:38.710
That's an idea.

39:38.793 --> 39:41.382
Hey, you remember that time
Tre stole that car,

39:41.462 --> 39:45.558
but it turned out to be a hearse and you
were so scared you pissed your pants?

39:48.386 --> 39:49.478
He was so scared.

39:55.018 --> 39:57.737
- I'll just be two minutes.
- Sure.

40:03.109 --> 40:05.362
Sorry about this,
but thanks for taking him.

40:05.445 --> 40:07.617
Of course, it's nice to see
the two of you together.

40:07.697 --> 40:09.449
Hey, man.

40:11.075 --> 40:14.705
You know, if you want, we could
stop for ice cream on the way back.

40:25.882 --> 40:28.805
And the difference between a veto
and a pocket veto?

40:28.885 --> 40:34.392
A pocket veto is when the President
doesn't sign a bill for ten days,

40:34.474 --> 40:37.272
but Congress can't overrule it.

40:37.352 --> 40:39.480
Yes! You are ready, Freddy.

40:39.562 --> 40:41.484
Oh. "Ready Freddy." I like that.

40:41.564 --> 40:44.283
That's funny. What's that?

40:46.235 --> 40:48.575
Fredo... He's...

40:48.655 --> 40:50.827
- I'm sorry.
- Is that marijuana?

40:50.907 --> 40:52.328
- It must have fallen...
- What's it doing...

40:52.408 --> 40:55.206
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, okay, what do we do?

40:55.286 --> 40:57.834
- What are we gonna do?
- Sorry, Joey.

40:57.914 --> 41:00.417
What are you doing? What are you...?

41:01.376 --> 41:02.719
Okay...

41:09.133 --> 41:11.306
Are you all right, ma'am?

42:51.527 --> 42:53.366
Can I help you?

42:53.446 --> 42:55.785
How much are the pies?

42:55.865 --> 42:57.742
They're all $12.

42:57.825 --> 43:00.954
I can have all of them for $12?

43:06.751 --> 43:08.923
Hey, I know you.

43:09.003 --> 43:10.880
Nope.

43:10.963 --> 43:13.386
Sure, I do. You're an actress, right?

43:13.466 --> 43:16.305
You're a police officer man.

43:16.385 --> 43:21.266
Yeah, well, retired, technically,
but they still need us on set.

43:21.349 --> 43:23.943
You know, in case a director
starts throwing stuff.

43:25.019 --> 43:27.608
Everybody calls me Zipper.

43:27.688 --> 43:29.861
Okay.

43:29.941 --> 43:33.239
And you are Miss...?

43:33.319 --> 43:34.946
Minervini.

43:35.029 --> 43:36.406
Miss Minervini.

43:36.489 --> 43:39.493
Mrs. Minervini.

43:39.575 --> 43:40.663
Missus.

43:40.743 --> 43:42.540
Well, actually,
I don't know if it's still missus

43:42.620 --> 43:45.668
- because my husband died, and I...
- I'm sorry.

43:45.748 --> 43:47.211
Thank you.

43:47.291 --> 43:51.758
It goes back to maybe
the maiden name, or...

43:51.838 --> 43:54.341
'Cause when you're divorced
I don't think that you still...

43:54.423 --> 43:57.221
I mean, that's... Of course that's
different, but I think maybe...

43:57.301 --> 43:58.302
Just... It would be...

43:59.846 --> 44:02.190
less confusing if you call me...

44:03.558 --> 44:04.901
Marnie.

44:06.185 --> 44:07.732
Okay, Marnie.

44:09.272 --> 44:12.236
Well, Marnie, do you wanna join us?

44:12.316 --> 44:13.613
Us?

44:13.693 --> 44:15.946
In a different language. Portuguese.

44:19.031 --> 44:22.580
So, we get to the area and, sure enough,

44:22.660 --> 44:24.332
there is this naked guy,

44:24.412 --> 44:26.380
and he's just walking up the street...

44:32.420 --> 44:35.173
refuses to put on clothes
or get in the car,

44:35.256 --> 44:37.384
and Bernie suggests that we...

44:41.637 --> 44:43.014
He would not go down!

44:43.097 --> 44:44.519
He just stands there, vibrating!

44:44.599 --> 44:46.476
Just pointing north!

44:47.977 --> 44:50.525
Oh, pardon my language.

44:50.605 --> 44:52.482
Were you talking?

44:57.153 --> 44:58.575
Thank you.

45:01.574 --> 45:03.576
Sorry about that. Those...

45:03.659 --> 45:07.959
Those guys are... They're good guys, but
they do like hearing themselves talk.

45:08.039 --> 45:10.883
Well, if I had those stories,
I would listen to myself think.

45:14.003 --> 45:15.676
Well...

45:18.799 --> 45:20.596
I gotta get going.

45:20.676 --> 45:23.975
I have to, dog-sit my daughter's kids,

45:24.055 --> 45:27.559
and, you know, my hands are... loud.

45:29.435 --> 45:30.482
Okay.

45:31.896 --> 45:35.776
Do you maybe need a ride or...

45:35.858 --> 45:38.030
No, I can't drive that.

45:38.110 --> 45:40.199
Okay.

45:40.279 --> 45:44.159
How about just this once I drive it,
and you can sit on the back?

45:44.242 --> 45:48.040
That's crazy. I would kill my daughter
if she died on a motorcycle.

45:48.120 --> 45:49.542
Oh, this isn't a motorcycle.

45:50.831 --> 45:52.708
This is a Harley Davidson.

45:53.459 --> 45:55.302
It's a world of difference.

45:56.212 --> 45:57.259
Come on, it'll be fun.

45:58.089 --> 46:00.511
The safest place you can be in Los Angeles

46:00.591 --> 46:03.891
is on this seat right here. I promise.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.393
I'll go slow.

46:12.728 --> 46:14.442
So tell me about your daughter.

46:14.522 --> 46:16.490
Not now!

46:22.071 --> 46:24.118
So why do they call you Zipper?

46:24.198 --> 46:26.245
It's my name.

46:26.325 --> 46:28.122
My last name.

46:28.202 --> 46:30.124
Then... that makes sense.

46:30.204 --> 46:31.918
- Yeah.
- What's your first name?

46:31.998 --> 46:33.711
Randy.

46:33.791 --> 46:35.668
- Or Randall.
- Randall.

46:35.751 --> 46:37.628
And are you from around here?

46:37.712 --> 46:39.383
Am I asking too many questions?

46:39.463 --> 46:41.181
No.

46:42.216 --> 46:45.139
I'm from outside Oxnard originally.

46:45.219 --> 46:47.722
And then I moved to Ventura
when I got married,

46:47.805 --> 46:51.059
and moved to Topanga when I got divorced.

46:51.142 --> 46:52.230
Oh, I'm sorry.

46:52.310 --> 46:55.530
Oh, don't be sorry. She's not.

46:57.565 --> 47:00.444
You know, she never smiled with her teeth.

47:00.526 --> 47:02.199
I should've known.

47:04.572 --> 47:06.574
Is Topanga on the beach?

47:06.657 --> 47:09.285
No, not on the beach, by the beach.

47:11.245 --> 47:12.872
I wouldn't mind living on the beach.

47:12.955 --> 47:14.457
Yeah.

47:15.333 --> 47:17.586
But I don't know
where I'd keep the chickens.

47:18.961 --> 47:20.178
Chickens?

47:21.547 --> 47:24.512
Yeah. Yeah. You got your dog people
and your cat people.

47:24.592 --> 47:27.181
I am a man with chickens.

47:27.261 --> 47:28.683
Get outta here.

47:28.763 --> 47:29.809
No...

47:29.889 --> 47:31.641
- Chickens?
- Absolutely.

47:32.933 --> 47:33.934
How many?

47:34.018 --> 47:36.396
Well, you know what they say
about counting chickens?

47:36.479 --> 47:37.981
No.

47:38.064 --> 47:41.443
You don't know what they say
about counting chickens, really?

47:41.525 --> 47:42.777
No.

47:42.860 --> 47:44.448
Didn't your grandma ever tell you that?

47:44.528 --> 47:47.156
No, we didn't...
My grandma didn't have chickens.

47:47.239 --> 47:49.787
Oh, yeah. You are a city girl, aren't you?

47:49.867 --> 47:53.207
Well, my chickens and I have a very
symbiotic relationship.

47:53.287 --> 47:55.835
I give them a coop and some feed,

47:55.915 --> 47:58.629
once in a while,
a little Parmesan cheese for a treat,

47:58.709 --> 48:00.803
and they keep me in eggs.

48:03.130 --> 48:04.632
Matter of fact... Excuse me.

48:08.094 --> 48:10.516
Oh, I can't believe it didn't break.

48:10.596 --> 48:13.520
Yeah. That's from the Ameraucana.
She's my only Easter egger.

48:17.603 --> 48:18.775
You wanna meet her?

48:19.980 --> 48:21.106
At your house?

48:21.190 --> 48:23.863
Well, she's been out at the bar
most of the night,

48:23.943 --> 48:26.162
but she's probably home by now.

48:33.661 --> 48:35.207
Watch your step there.

48:35.287 --> 48:39.918
Here, let me go in first.
Make sure we don't let anybody escape.

48:43.170 --> 48:47.300
Well, now here's...
That's Patsy, and Kathleen.

48:47.383 --> 48:49.805
Over here is, that's Ayla.

48:49.885 --> 48:52.850
Katie and Ruth. That's Gayle.

48:52.930 --> 48:56.771
And... the golden girl there is Henrietta.

48:56.851 --> 48:59.190
And now don't let her sass you.

48:59.270 --> 49:02.568
She gets a little attitude
on account of she's so damn beautiful.

49:02.648 --> 49:03.986
So beautiful.

49:04.066 --> 49:05.784
Girls, this is Marnie.

49:06.652 --> 49:08.654
Hey.

49:09.697 --> 49:11.369
Was out here a couple months ago

49:11.449 --> 49:14.997
and I brought that boombox with me
and I was playing some tunes.

49:15.077 --> 49:18.542
And I looked at their faces,
and I swear they just looked happy.

49:18.622 --> 49:20.169
So I did a little experiment

49:20.249 --> 49:23.002
to try and find out what kind of music
they dig the most.

49:23.294 --> 49:26.008
Turns out, rock 'n' roll makes
'em lay eggs like crazy,

49:26.088 --> 49:28.135
but it does stress 'em out a little bit.

49:28.215 --> 49:30.012
Oh, I understand.

49:30.092 --> 49:31.890
Classical's good. They like that.

49:33.053 --> 49:35.101
- Reggae, not good.
- Really?

49:35.181 --> 49:37.149
No. Don't know what it is.

49:37.641 --> 49:42.397
Turns out, for the optimal combination
of happiness and productivity...

49:43.439 --> 49:45.658
all roads lead to Dolly.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.503
How can you tell if it's working?

50:07.171 --> 50:09.594
Don't they look like they're smiling?

50:12.468 --> 50:13.970
Yeah, they do.

50:30.861 --> 50:34.285
Joey didn't want to know how much time
he had left, but Lori and I knew.

50:34.365 --> 50:39.838
And he asked her to throw us
a wedding anniversary party in August.

50:40.663 --> 50:43.878
But... she knew he
wouldn't be around that long,

50:43.958 --> 50:47.053
so she said, which was so brilliant...

50:47.836 --> 50:51.716
"Why don't I throw you a
'40 Years From The Day You Met' party?"

50:52.341 --> 50:55.639
And she decorated
the whole house like 1969.

50:55.719 --> 50:58.142
And the music was 1969,

50:58.222 --> 51:00.850
and all her friends
came dressed like the '60s.

51:01.392 --> 51:05.568
And his brothers flew out,
and we had fondue.

51:06.355 --> 51:08.824
It was a spectacular day.

51:09.942 --> 51:11.285
What about you?

51:11.902 --> 51:13.279
You got kids?

51:13.362 --> 51:14.614
Two beautiful girls.

51:15.531 --> 51:16.827
- Nice.
- Yeah.

51:16.907 --> 51:19.205
The one that likes me
lives halfway across the country,

51:19.285 --> 51:21.754
and the one that doesn't
is just over in Palm Springs.

51:22.329 --> 51:23.455
Of course.

51:24.123 --> 51:25.466
Lizzie was...

51:26.000 --> 51:28.839
She was still in high school
when her mom and I fell apart,

51:28.919 --> 51:31.138
which was my fault, mostly.

51:31.922 --> 51:33.174
Seventy-thirty.

51:35.050 --> 51:36.677
Sixty-forty maybe.

51:37.886 --> 51:40.435
I was working all the time, you know.

51:41.640 --> 51:43.642
And then I brought it home with me.

51:43.726 --> 51:48.527
And then, when she started to slip away,
I was just gripping and...

51:51.984 --> 51:54.448
She's in a reha... in a program now.

51:54.528 --> 51:55.996
She's in a program.

51:57.990 --> 52:01.961
Kept hoping one of those steps
would lead her back here, but...

52:03.329 --> 52:07.004
I think I just made her
scared to tell me things.

52:07.958 --> 52:11.173
Sure, what...
Look what you were seeing every day,

52:11.253 --> 52:13.592
all that serial killers and stuff.

52:13.672 --> 52:16.845
I mean, I watch the news,
never mind being part of it,

52:16.925 --> 52:20.015
it's like being in an action movie
or something.

52:20.095 --> 52:21.312
Yeah, well...

52:23.515 --> 52:24.562
not anymore.

52:24.642 --> 52:27.316
It's not your fault
the world's a scary place.

52:28.354 --> 52:29.822
Thank God you're retired.

52:30.898 --> 52:33.117
Yep. Yeah, it has its moments.

52:33.942 --> 52:35.694
And I have learned to calm down.

52:37.112 --> 52:38.455
You know, I mean, if...

52:39.448 --> 52:41.325
Lizzie doesn't want me
to call her anymore,

52:41.408 --> 52:42.871
I have to respect that.

52:42.951 --> 52:45.170
No. You don't... I mean...

52:46.455 --> 52:48.002
You can't not call.

52:48.624 --> 52:50.217
Well, I mean, I...

52:50.668 --> 52:52.881
I left messages until it was full.

52:52.961 --> 52:54.049
So?

52:54.129 --> 52:55.301
Sorry.

52:56.382 --> 52:59.727
I mean, it's not my business,
but you have to call her.

53:00.511 --> 53:02.309
Well, I...

53:03.263 --> 53:05.641
I really wouldn't know what to say.

53:05.724 --> 53:08.273
You just tell her that you love her
no matter what she's up to.

53:09.144 --> 53:12.523
You know, everybody knows their mother
loves them unconditionally,

53:12.606 --> 53:14.734
but fathers have to
say it out loud, I think.

53:23.242 --> 53:24.915
What time is it?

53:46.306 --> 53:47.558
Here you go, I'll trade you.

53:47.641 --> 53:48.813
Thanks.

53:50.894 --> 53:52.362
Take that, too.

53:54.106 --> 53:55.278
Thank you.

53:57.985 --> 53:59.737
Hang on here, let me...

54:00.404 --> 54:01.621
Let me give you this.

54:02.573 --> 54:06.203
You know, in case you need to get
out of a speeding ticket or something.

54:07.995 --> 54:09.212
Cool.

54:15.878 --> 54:17.050
Here, doggies.

56:02.317 --> 56:06.447
Anyway, I'm landing at JFK at 5:30.

56:06.530 --> 56:08.702
Just thought I should head
back east for a little bit,

56:08.782 --> 56:11.752
see Daddy's brothers and maybe
get to visit you on the set.

56:13.871 --> 56:15.248
Don't worry about the dogs.

56:15.330 --> 56:18.630
I dropped them off at Jacob's house
so they'd be somewhere familiar.

56:20.836 --> 56:23.760
To be honest, I can't wait
to be back in the city.

56:25.382 --> 56:27.680
Seeing the old stomping grounds...

56:28.802 --> 56:31.851
walking through Midtown
in the Garment District...

56:33.056 --> 56:34.808
and seeing Daddy's old building.

56:39.271 --> 56:41.273
But mostly, I can't wait to see you.

56:42.024 --> 56:44.368
So, let me know when's a good time.

56:48.363 --> 56:50.741
We skip that, because that's,
like, the whole point.

56:50.824 --> 56:52.621
That's like the only real thing.
Know what I mean?

56:52.701 --> 56:55.123
It just feels like none of these things
my character would say.

56:55.203 --> 56:57.042
Is there any way
we can get some new pages?

56:57.122 --> 56:59.625
- What would you like to say?
- Just something less jokey.

56:59.708 --> 57:01.176
Hi!

57:02.294 --> 57:03.796
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

57:03.879 --> 57:04.925
- Hi.
- Hi.

57:05.005 --> 57:07.224
- Thanks.
- I'm gonna find you and...

57:08.175 --> 57:09.972
- Hi. Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.

57:10.052 --> 57:11.804
This is your chair, okay?

57:13.513 --> 57:14.810
And, then...

57:15.390 --> 57:17.518
This... These are your headphones.

57:17.601 --> 57:20.901
Okay? And... don't talk to anybody.

57:21.355 --> 57:23.652
Just... And the safe word is "Cantaloupe."

57:23.732 --> 57:24.903
- Okay.
- Okay?

57:24.983 --> 57:25.984
Okay.

57:30.489 --> 57:31.866
On the bell.

57:37.162 --> 57:38.750
And, action.

57:38.830 --> 57:40.457
All right. Call me, okay?

57:40.540 --> 57:41.757
Good night.

57:44.086 --> 57:46.464
Jesus! Mom, you scared the crap out of me!

57:46.546 --> 57:49.136
Come on, don't you have ice-cream
in the guest house?

57:49.216 --> 57:52.431
Well, yeah, but I already picked all
the cookie dough out of it.

57:52.511 --> 57:53.808
What are you reading?

57:54.471 --> 57:56.685
- Is that my journal?
- Is that what this is?

57:56.765 --> 57:58.642
I thought the character
was a little slutty.

57:58.725 --> 57:59.897
Give me that.

57:59.977 --> 58:02.105
Aren't you too old to keep a journal?

58:02.187 --> 58:04.276
Aren't you too old to be reading
your daughter's journal?

58:04.356 --> 58:07.075
That's a violation of space and time!

58:07.609 --> 58:09.698
Now, what's all the yelling about?

58:09.778 --> 58:11.530
I violated space and time.

58:12.990 --> 58:16.540
So, what, you... you peed
in the upstairs, shower, too, huh?

58:17.285 --> 58:19.413
What's wrong with the shower
in the guest house?

58:19.496 --> 58:23.217
Well, it's got this, weird smell.

58:25.168 --> 58:29.217
Mom, Dad, when I said you
should move here after you retire,

58:29.297 --> 58:31.845
I didn't mean "here," here.
Okay? I need to get a life.

58:31.925 --> 58:34.724
I need to meet a guy and get married,
so I can give you grandchildren, so...

58:35.721 --> 58:37.064
Wet towel, Dad.

58:48.775 --> 58:49.947
Cut!

58:51.945 --> 58:54.289
Here, and jump straight to there.

58:55.615 --> 58:57.913
I just feel like
we could land it a little better.

58:57.993 --> 59:00.997
- And we need another option for that.
- All right.

59:01.079 --> 59:02.797
I think, definitely, write that down.

59:05.500 --> 59:07.753
Hey, you. That was so good.

59:08.336 --> 59:10.425
Not too big? Did you love it?

59:10.505 --> 59:11.843
- Perfect.
- Space and time...

59:11.923 --> 59:14.346
- Great, great, great, great.
- Awesome, man. Thanks.

59:26.438 --> 59:28.861
You look so much like him.

59:30.108 --> 59:31.360
I'm sorry?

59:32.235 --> 59:36.741
The... character that
you're playing, it, it's...

59:37.157 --> 59:40.957
You look so much like
the man that it's based on.

59:41.953 --> 59:44.251
I didn't realize it was,
you know, based on...

59:44.331 --> 59:46.254
- So much like...
- Cantaloupe!

59:49.002 --> 59:50.465
Would you like some cantaloupe,

59:50.545 --> 59:53.173
because we have a fresh tray going around.

59:53.256 --> 59:56.135
And then that's when,
that's when he looks down

59:56.218 --> 59:58.181
- and sees this giant snake right there.
- No, no, no!

59:58.261 --> 59:59.638
And he's like... he's like,

59:59.721 --> 01:00:02.269
"Jock! What's this
huge snake in the plane?!"

01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:04.602
And, and Jock's like,
"Oh, that's just Reggie."

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:07.024
And, and Indy's like, "I hate snakes!"

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:09.448
And then they just fly off
into the sunset.

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:11.945
Yeah. And that's the first 20 minutes

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:14.278
of Indiana Jones
and the Raiders of the Lost Ark.

01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:15.824
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.

01:00:15.904 --> 01:00:17.576
- I never saw it.
- What?

01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:19.995
No. I feel like I've seen it now,
but I never saw it.

01:00:20.075 --> 01:00:22.077
Well, we gotta watch it
before you leave town.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.331
- All right.
- Movie night.

01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:24.663
- I like it.
- Thank you.

01:00:25.872 --> 01:00:27.461
Drink it, drink it, drink it,
drink it, drink it...

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:29.134
You two meet on the set?

01:00:30.418 --> 01:00:32.546
Yeah, just two weeks ago.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:34.973
Like I was telling you,
right before you asked him to dinner.

01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:38.555
I think it is so romantic,
meeting on a movie set.

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:41.263
Well, not really, I mean, plenty
of people meet on movie sets.

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:43.060
It's usually scandalous and home-wrecking.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.478
That's so true. So true.

01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:46.396
I met Lori's father in Atlantic City.

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:48.069
It was pretty romantic.

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:50.230
And then we got married six months later.

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:51.359
Six months?

01:00:51.439 --> 01:00:52.652
Yeah. I think when you know, you know.

01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:54.530
I totally agree with you,
you know something...

01:00:56.862 --> 01:00:58.575
You know, I'm just gonna
run to the bathroom.

01:00:58.655 --> 01:01:00.077
Tinkle time.

01:01:01.366 --> 01:01:03.835
Okay, hurry back. Dinner's coming.

01:01:05.954 --> 01:01:07.422
Yeah, there we go.

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.504
She's so lovely.

01:01:10.584 --> 01:01:12.211
- Good job.
- She is lovely. Thank you.

01:01:12.294 --> 01:01:14.171
Yeah. So, hey...

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:21.139
Oh, my God.

01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:22.971
I got that the day after we met.

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:26.183
You know, when I know
I want something, I go get it.

01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:27.859
That's how I got this far in my career.

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:31.564
Russell Boyd, Rodney Charters,
Don McAlpine.

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:34.611
When the top cinematographers
need a B camera operator,

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:36.279
do you know who they call?

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:39.408
- You?
- Boom! When you know you know!

01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:44.664
- Yeah.
- It's so fast.

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:47.746
But, if Lori's happy...

01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:50.457
I was thinking we'd get everyone
she knows together,

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:54.506
and we, we put together
one of those YouTube videos.

01:01:54.586 --> 01:01:56.633
And everyone she knows
comes out one by one,

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:58.885
doing a choreographed dance number.

01:01:58.965 --> 01:02:01.179
And then it ends with me
appearing with the ring...

01:02:01.259 --> 01:02:04.763
This will all be
one tracking shot, of course.

01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:07.144
I love it. Oh, my gosh.
That's so beautiful.

01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:10.353
- I'm gonna propose to her...
- She's gonna love it.

01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:12.563
I just feel like the whole thing

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:17.195
is getting bastardized
by everybody's notes, you know?

01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:20.449
By now, I can't even remember what
I was trying to say in the first place.

01:02:22.489 --> 01:02:23.785
Why are you so hyper?

01:02:23.865 --> 01:02:25.492
I'm not. I'm just excited for you.

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:29.124
And... Ben seems nice.

01:02:29.204 --> 01:02:31.332
Yeah, well, do not get used to him, Mom,

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:33.461
because that's not gonna last.

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:35.338
I'm not so sure.

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:38.633
No, I'm telling you, I'm just rebounding.

01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:42.053
But, you know, sometimes people think
that they're having a rebound

01:02:42.133 --> 01:02:44.261
and then it evolves into something more.

01:02:46.054 --> 01:02:48.852
Actually, there's something
I have to tell you.

01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:50.400
Come here.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.733
I was engaged to someone else
before Daddy.

01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:00.034
Yeah, you told me that before.

01:03:00.485 --> 01:03:01.573
I did?

01:03:01.653 --> 01:03:04.868
Yeah, his name was Matteo
and you weren't that attracted to him,

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:06.912
then you went to Atlantic City
with your girlfriends,

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:08.244
and that's where you met Daddy.

01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:10.078
You have, like, three stories, Mom.

01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:12.584
All right, all right,
so you're rebounding.

01:03:12.664 --> 01:03:15.213
Well, then, why don't you
and Jacob give it another go?

01:03:18.545 --> 01:03:20.968
Because that's not up to me.

01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:24.930
Well... maybe if you tell him
how you feel.

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.933
See that's the great lie
of your life, Mom.

01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:29.765
You think if you dream it, you can do it.

01:03:29.848 --> 01:03:32.226
- The world just doesn't work that way.
- What are you talking about?

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:35.148
You dreamt that you would be a writer,
and you did it.

01:03:35.228 --> 01:03:37.525
You dreamt you would come
to Hollywood, and you did it.

01:03:37.605 --> 01:03:40.108
You dream up lots of stories,
all the time.

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:44.741
That reminds me, I met the cutest girl
in the bathroom at JFK.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:47.410
She's in a wheelchair and she's a blogger.

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.117
She empowers young women.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.747
And, I told her you were a writer.

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:53.250
She didn't know who you were,
but she was very, very excited

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:54.501
about the possibility...

01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:58.004
I told her you would have coffee with
her and give her some industry tips.

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:00.048
I don't have any industry tips.

01:04:00.128 --> 01:04:01.505
Well, it's just coffee.

01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:03.723
She's in a wheelchair.

01:04:23.068 --> 01:04:25.412
How do you take a selfie?

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:28.247
What do you mean?
You just take a picture of yourself.

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:31.459
Yeah, but, how do you
take a picture of yourself?

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:34.037
Who are you sending a selfie to?

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:38.712
Just never mind.

01:04:38.792 --> 01:04:41.006
- Never mind.
- Do you have a new friend?

01:04:41.086 --> 01:04:42.429
My... I'm not talking about it.

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:45.882
- I'm not talking about it.
- Mom!

01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:48.263
- Stop.
- Who's your new friend?

01:04:48.343 --> 01:04:50.095
I'm not talking about it. It's not funny.

01:04:50.178 --> 01:04:51.474
- I'm not talking about...
- Can I meet him?

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:53.768
- Where are the bottles? They in here?
- Did you meet him at The Grove?

01:04:53.848 --> 01:04:55.065
Stop it.

01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:56.643
Stop it.

01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:02.191
This is obviously me.

01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:04.443
Hi, Zipper.

01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:07.450
It's, Marnie Minervini.

01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:10.156
I'm calling from New York,
with my daughter.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.661
She's doing her TV show.

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:15.832
And... today I saw the set
and it made me think of you.

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:18.290
I mean, 'cause of your job.

01:05:18.373 --> 01:05:20.467
Also, I mean, what you do for a living.

01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:25.675
Anyway, so, I ordered some scrambled
eggs at the hotel this morning

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:27.974
and they were nothing like
what I had of yours.

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:30.889
I mean, the eggs that you gave me.

01:05:30.969 --> 01:05:32.141
I had one.

01:05:33.221 --> 01:05:34.347
Briefly.

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:38.021
And so I just thought I would...

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:40.445
check in on the chickens.

01:05:42.147 --> 01:05:45.362
Also... Oh, yes, my daughter
has a new boyfriend.

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:47.570
Or should I say fiancé?

01:05:47.652 --> 01:05:49.575
Yep. So, okay.

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:53.617
So, call me. Okay, love you... Bye!

01:05:54.868 --> 01:05:56.040
Bye.

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:00.582
- Marnie!
- Marnie!

01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:10.467
- You look very good. California.
- You look very good, very well.

01:06:15.263 --> 01:06:17.311
So, Tina, Tina, how are you feeling?

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:21.564
How's the TV show?

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:23.608
So funny. You would not believe.

01:06:23.688 --> 01:06:25.816
I don't know where
she gets her characters from.

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:28.026
She's a very smart girl.

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:29.948
- Good imagination more than anything.
- That is mine.

01:06:30.028 --> 01:06:31.575
Salute.

01:06:42.123 --> 01:06:43.375
Very sweet grapes.

01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:45.380
You don't... You don't remember?

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:46.506
No.

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:47.963
Two years younger than me.
You don't remember?

01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:49.467
I remember the grub.

01:06:49.547 --> 01:06:50.799
- Yeah.
- That smells good.

01:06:50.882 --> 01:06:54.728
So, the first time I cooked for Joe,
I wanted to make pasta.

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:58.306
And my mother told me
that the way you know if pasta's done

01:06:58.389 --> 01:07:01.643
- is you throw it against the wall...
- Oh, no.

01:07:01.726 --> 01:07:04.821
...and if it sticks,
then you take it out of the water.

01:07:05.939 --> 01:07:07.532
So I boiled the water.

01:07:08.233 --> 01:07:09.735
I break the pasta in half...

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:14.326
I know. I know.

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:16.453
And I start cooking it.

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:20.208
And... and then I...
throw it against the wall.

01:07:21.454 --> 01:07:22.922
Nothing. Nothing.

01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:27.213
So then I cook it a little bit more,
cook it a little bit more.

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:31.014
And then finally, I throw it against the
wall and it stuck to the wall.

01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:34.387
And it stuck to itself.
And it stuck to the pot.

01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:36.686
And it stuck to everything it touched.

01:07:37.929 --> 01:07:41.399
So, Joe takes his first bite.

01:07:41.849 --> 01:07:44.522
So, it seems okay. Takes his first bite.

01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:48.232
And then I see him take a little
bit of the pasta off the plate,

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:50.528
and he puts it in a napkin.

01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:53.531
And I say to him, "What are you doing?"

01:07:53.611 --> 01:07:57.366
And he says,
"I just gotta show this to my mother."

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:09.088
Yeah, it was a lucky thing we were. Right?

01:08:09.168 --> 01:08:10.795
I would have had a problem.

01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:14.424
I can't believe...

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:17.477
I can't believe it's
his anniversary already.

01:08:18.219 --> 01:08:20.596
I know, already a year. Unbelievable.

01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:22.682
You mean two years.

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:25.689
Yeah. A year from last year.

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:28.649
Time flies, huh?

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:30.482
- Time flies.
- Time flies.

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:33.697
So, Marnie...

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:36.783
We were thinking that...

01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:40.743
you can keep half of his ashes
with you and Lori in California,

01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:44.040
and, the other half
could be buried in Elizabeth.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.167
- That way...
- We have some place...

01:08:46.247 --> 01:08:49.170
- Yeah, we all have some place to go.
- Yeah, we'll visit, you know.

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:50.796
Yeah.

01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:53.675
You know, I really think that
I want to talk to Lori about it,

01:08:53.755 --> 01:08:55.843
'cause she's been very sensitive
about the whole thing.

01:08:55.923 --> 01:08:58.011
We already talked to her
and what did she say?

01:08:58.091 --> 01:09:00.265
- She says it's up to you.
- Up to you.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:05.228
Since we're all
on the East Coast, for a change,

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:07.397
we could at least pick out a headstone.

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:10.149
Lori said you wanted
to use a quote, maybe.

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:13.194
- Yeah, something from "My Way."
- It doesn't have to be "My Way."

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:15.863
- How could it not be "My Way"?
- As long as it's Sinatra.

01:09:15.943 --> 01:09:17.694
Well, of course, it is Sinatra, obviously.

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:19.997
It should be "My Way."
That was his... It should be...

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:24.540
Marnie, it is all up to you.

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:29.419
If you want to bury his ashes here, okay.

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:32.296
And if you wanted to
just sprinkle a little here,

01:09:32.377 --> 01:09:34.220
sprinkle a little over there, fine.

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.218
Up to you.

01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:38.890
How could it not be "My Way"?

01:09:39.966 --> 01:09:41.430
How could it not be "My Way"?

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:43.057
- Of course.
- It has to be "My Way"!

01:09:43.136 --> 01:09:45.435
We talking about Joe! Joe did it his way!

01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:48.769
He lived his way! It has to be "My Way"!

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:52.104
No "Strangers in the Night." "My Way"!

01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:59.073
Joseph Minervini?

01:09:59.153 --> 01:10:00.496
What?

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:06.794
I...I handed you my husband's license.

01:10:07.912 --> 01:10:09.164
There.

01:10:09.831 --> 01:10:12.084
Marnie Minervini. That makes more sense.

01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:14.380
And where you headed today, Ms. Minervini?

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.258
Los Angeles. I live there now.

01:10:17.422 --> 01:10:18.885
How was your time in New York?

01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:21.218
Great. My daughter shot a pilot.

01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:30.731
No. It's...

01:11:28.743 --> 01:11:32.166
Welcome to Los Angeles,
where the local time is 10:37.

01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:34.499
Please remain in your seat
while we taxi to the gate.

01:11:34.582 --> 01:11:36.960
If your cell phone is within reach,
you may use it now.

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:47.807
Hey, Marnie, it's your new friend, Zipper,

01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:50.476
or Randy, I guess,
depending on who you ask.

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:52.058
I just saw that you called.

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:53.893
Sorry I'm just getting back to you now.

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:56.899
There's, just terrible reception
in the canyon.

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:58.568
I could barely hear your message.

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:02.196
But... just wanted to try you back

01:12:02.276 --> 01:12:04.949
and see how the East Coast
is treating you,

01:12:05.029 --> 01:12:10.455
and, also let you know that the chickens
have expanded their musical library

01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:14.333
to include Peggy Lee now,
as well as, Dolly Parton covers,

01:12:14.413 --> 01:12:18.463
so I guess you've got that
to look forward to,

01:12:18.543 --> 01:12:20.965
if you ever make it back this way. But...

01:12:21.045 --> 01:12:24.299
Anyway, give me a call if,
you know, if you get a chance.

01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:26.971
And, yeah, there you go.

01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:29.395
Okay. "Love you." Bye.

01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:38.980
Hey, Marnie,
it's your new friend Zipper...

01:12:39.063 --> 01:12:43.068
Anyway, just wanted to let you know that
I made it back to the West Coast,

01:12:43.150 --> 01:12:46.654
and... It's a shame you're gonna
miss the wedding because of reshoots.

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:49.744
And sorry to hear you broke up with Ben.

01:12:49.824 --> 01:12:52.077
I guess you didn't like the YouTube video?

01:12:52.159 --> 01:12:56.039
Anyway, I know you're busy,
so don't worry about calling me back.

01:12:56.747 --> 01:13:00.843
If she did, she never did say so to Daddy

01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:04.589
Bein' took for granted

01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:06.845
Was a thing that she accepted

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:11.851
She didn't need those things
to make her happy

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:14.974
She didn't even seem to notice

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:17.310
That he didn't kiss and hold her

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:21.944
If she did, she never did say so to Daddy

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:27.365
Hi.

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:33.079
You didn't hear any, kind of,

01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:35.787
music-type sounds coming
from inside, did you?

01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:37.838
That wasn't you, was it?

01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:41.091
Just a little Dolly cover band
I'm putting together.

01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:44.595
Thus far we have a largely avian fan base.

01:13:46.464 --> 01:13:47.636
What's this?

01:13:48.466 --> 01:13:50.888
Nothing, I just... I picked this up...

01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:54.934
to help... well, play music,
for, you know,

01:13:55.014 --> 01:13:58.018
Henrietta and Susan, and Gayle,

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.022
and, you know, all your gals.

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:01.775
You just plug it in your iPhone.

01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:05.066
God, do you have an iPhone?

01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:07.823
I've been meaning to get one of those.

01:14:08.736 --> 01:14:11.865
Thank you. It's... it's really nice.

01:14:13.991 --> 01:14:15.162
You want to come inside?

01:14:15.242 --> 01:14:18.246
You can help me, whatever,
plug it in, figure it out.

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:21.374
No, I'm supposed to go to this wedding.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.633
- Well, that's fun.
- Yeah.

01:14:27.672 --> 01:14:29.015
So...

01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:32.935
You know...

01:14:34.887 --> 01:14:36.309
I missed you.

01:14:37.348 --> 01:14:39.066
I guess that sounds funny.

01:14:41.185 --> 01:14:43.482
I called her, by the way.

01:14:43.562 --> 01:14:44.859
Lizzie, my youngest.

01:14:44.939 --> 01:14:46.903
Zipper, that's great.

01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:48.451
She yelled at me.

01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:50.240
A lot.

01:14:51.237 --> 01:14:55.328
I was actually thinking maybe tomorrow
I might take a ride out there

01:14:55.408 --> 01:14:57.371
and let her scream in my face a little.

01:14:57.451 --> 01:14:59.829
- That's a good idea.
- You think?

01:14:59.912 --> 01:15:01.038
Yeah.

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:03.837
Do you... Do you wanna come with?

01:15:06.043 --> 01:15:08.671
Just a day trip. Nothing overnight, or...

01:15:10.131 --> 01:15:12.509
I thought maybe you'd like
to see the desert. It's...

01:15:13.467 --> 01:15:14.889
It's beautiful.

01:15:16.303 --> 01:15:17.725
I can't.

01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:21.934
I can't right now. I...

01:15:22.977 --> 01:15:28.529
You know, I just... I wanted to stop by
and just drop off the speakers, and...

01:15:29.817 --> 01:15:31.614
tell you that I'm not gonna be around much

01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:33.321
because I've got to go back East,

01:15:33.404 --> 01:15:37.079
and so I'm not gonna be around much,
for a while.

01:15:39.577 --> 01:15:40.874
Okay.

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:26.090
One more.

01:16:35.049 --> 01:16:36.767
Tehya, Tehya, come...

01:16:37.468 --> 01:16:40.142
I'll take her, it's all right.
Come here, sweetie.

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:29.607
Thank you all so much.

01:17:29.687 --> 01:17:34.028
There are just so many people
in this room who made this day possible.

01:17:34.108 --> 01:17:35.860
I can't... I can't believe it.

01:17:36.694 --> 01:17:39.742
- First, my incredible wife...
- Stop it.

01:17:39.822 --> 01:17:43.871
...who married me one year ago
against her better judgement.

01:17:43.951 --> 01:17:44.952
Well...

01:17:45.035 --> 01:17:47.750
And agreed to do it again,
in front of our loved ones,

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:49.673
because she knew it was important to me.

01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:52.672
To my bridesmaids.

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:56.300
Nobody could ask for 13 greater friends,

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:58.428
and I just love you guys so much.

01:17:58.924 --> 01:18:02.929
And I wanna thank my family for
flying in from all across the country.

01:18:03.012 --> 01:18:04.389
Daddy, I love you.

01:18:05.139 --> 01:18:06.686
And Marnie...

01:18:07.391 --> 01:18:11.065
I mean, words cannot even begin

01:18:11.145 --> 01:18:13.273
to express my gratitude to you.

01:18:13.939 --> 01:18:15.861
After my mother died, I just...

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:19.195
I couldn't even imagine that I could feel

01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:22.407
loved so unconditionally,

01:18:22.489 --> 01:18:24.537
by someone who wasn't my family.

01:18:24.617 --> 01:18:27.206
I mean, you are, you are real proof

01:18:27.286 --> 01:18:29.583
that when one angel leaves this earth,

01:18:29.663 --> 01:18:31.336
another one takes its place.

01:18:32.166 --> 01:18:33.629
And I love you.

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:36.383
- To Marnie!
- To Marnie!

01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:04.300
Thank you. Thank you.

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:06.472
Thank you.

01:20:06.552 --> 01:20:08.099
Now we're gonna do a new one.

01:20:14.351 --> 01:20:15.898
It's a slow song.

01:20:16.562 --> 01:20:19.441
I honestly don't remember
the last time I danced that much.

01:20:19.523 --> 01:20:22.151
I know, right? We used to dance
all the time when I was a kid.

01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:24.487
I tell Lori,
"Why don't you go out dancing?"

01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:27.534
I mean, go out. Dance.

01:20:27.614 --> 01:20:30.242
You know, this is an amazing thing
you've done here, Marnie.

01:20:30.326 --> 01:20:32.414
They look really happy, don't they?

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:33.541
Yeah.

01:20:39.126 --> 01:20:41.715
- So, look, about that lunch...
- No, excuse me, one second.

01:20:41.795 --> 01:20:43.092
Okay.

01:20:47.134 --> 01:20:48.932
Jacob, hi.

01:20:49.928 --> 01:20:52.226
- Hi.
- She loves you, you know.

01:20:52.723 --> 01:20:54.144
Lori loves you.

01:20:54.224 --> 01:20:57.979
And I know because I see how unhappy
she is since you guys split.

01:20:58.062 --> 01:21:01.277
And, I know everybody's
supposed to make their own happiness,

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:03.696
but she's never been like that.
Well, I mean, maybe

01:21:03.776 --> 01:21:05.653
she was like that before,
but she's not anymore,

01:21:05.736 --> 01:21:09.240
and I don't know if it's
too late for you guys,

01:21:09.323 --> 01:21:12.452
but I know it's also totally awkward

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:14.623
and I'm overstepping
my boundaries maybe...

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:16.330
Well, I know I'm
overstepping my boundaries.

01:21:16.413 --> 01:21:19.003
But if there's just even
the slightest little chance

01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:21.255
that you could go
back with her and make her happy,

01:21:21.335 --> 01:21:23.588
well, then it doesn't matter,
because all that matters to me

01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:25.843
is that you make her happy
and that she be happy.

01:21:25.923 --> 01:21:28.392
That's all that matters.
So, what do you say?

01:21:29.635 --> 01:21:31.182
Marnie, I'm...

01:21:32.262 --> 01:21:33.855
I'm sorry, I...

01:21:38.352 --> 01:21:39.820
Oh, hi.

01:21:40.396 --> 01:21:42.364
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:44.361
Yeah.

01:21:44.441 --> 01:21:47.194
So I'm... I was... going.

01:21:47.694 --> 01:21:48.911
See you.

01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:51.452
Marnie, why don't you stay
for one more drink.

01:21:51.532 --> 01:21:53.785
I got dogs to feed and I've got a...

01:21:59.456 --> 01:22:00.628
Problem?

01:22:01.542 --> 01:22:03.590
All right. Well, thank you very much.

01:22:04.294 --> 01:22:07.298
Well, it looks like my car was stolen.

01:22:07.923 --> 01:22:10.517
My God, the crime in this city...

01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:15.269
- I'm sorry this is how your night ends.
- It's crazy, yeah.

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:18.984
Can't remember when I had that much fun.

01:22:19.643 --> 01:22:20.981
- Yeah.
- You know?

01:22:21.061 --> 01:22:23.814
- It was nice.
- Couple of Brooklynites, we are.

01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:25.775
Yeah. Yeah.

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:29.320
And that dress is... it's...

01:22:30.237 --> 01:22:31.533
just a knockout!

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:34.203
Thanks. It's actually my daughter's.

01:22:34.283 --> 01:22:35.660
Get outta here.

01:22:36.869 --> 01:22:39.458
The color, like blood red.

01:22:39.538 --> 01:22:41.211
Blood... Oh, yeah.

01:22:42.207 --> 01:22:43.424
I guess.

01:22:45.502 --> 01:22:47.004
And the hair to match.

01:22:52.676 --> 01:22:55.646
Eyes! Throat! Crotch!

01:22:56.096 --> 01:22:57.810
No. Out, out, out.

01:22:57.890 --> 01:22:59.767
Marnie! What...

01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:02.978
What are you doing?

01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:09.110
What the fuck?

01:23:21.622 --> 01:23:24.000
Yeah. I mean,
we have mostly Apple products,

01:23:24.082 --> 01:23:25.546
'cause it's an Apple-based store.

01:23:25.626 --> 01:23:27.754
Wait, are you a student? Me, too.

01:23:28.504 --> 01:23:30.092
You can probably get a student discount.

01:23:30.172 --> 01:23:31.799
Wait, you're really a student, right?

01:23:31.882 --> 01:23:34.260
You'd be surprised how many times
I hear... No, I'm joking.

01:23:37.763 --> 01:23:40.061
Oh, shit. Sorry.

01:23:42.893 --> 01:23:47.945
Anyway, every year the writer's pitch
the studio their ideas.

01:23:48.774 --> 01:23:51.196
And the studio picks a small
percentage of those,

01:23:51.276 --> 01:23:52.778
to pay the writers to make scripts.

01:23:53.654 --> 01:23:56.743
And then out of those scripts,
they pick even a smaller amount

01:23:56.823 --> 01:23:59.793
to shoot the pilot, to...
I mean, shoot the film.

01:24:00.327 --> 01:24:04.002
And then out of those,
a handful actually make it to the air.

01:24:04.623 --> 01:24:07.877
And then an even smaller amount
actually stay on the air,

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.883
like Seinfeld or something, right?

01:24:12.339 --> 01:24:13.636
You want the TV on?

01:24:20.347 --> 01:24:21.643
Hello?

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:23.316
Mom, I need you.

01:24:24.768 --> 01:24:26.065
- Did you bring them?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:24:28.814 --> 01:24:30.152
- What are these?
- Bagels.

01:24:30.232 --> 01:24:31.404
This is the pregnancy test.

01:24:35.779 --> 01:24:37.743
Why did you get the jumbo pack?

01:24:37.823 --> 01:24:39.620
I didn't know how many times
you have to do it.

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:41.122
It's just the one time.

01:24:43.829 --> 01:24:45.752
Please don't watch me pee on a stick.

01:24:47.624 --> 01:24:50.343
Not really that late, for me.

01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:53.213
It's probably just stress.

01:24:53.297 --> 01:24:55.093
I can't stop sleeping,
but that's about it.

01:24:55.173 --> 01:24:57.596
I just hope you know who the father is.

01:24:57.676 --> 01:24:59.473
I can't believe you just said that.

01:24:59.553 --> 01:25:01.396
I didn't mean it in a bad way.

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:07.231
I slept with Jacob once when I had to go
to his house to pick up my dogs.

01:25:07.311 --> 01:25:08.607
Thanks to you.

01:25:08.687 --> 01:25:10.439
And besides, I'm probably barren.

01:25:11.607 --> 01:25:15.077
That's something you should worry about.
I've a lot of testosterone in me.

01:25:15.694 --> 01:25:18.408
There, see? Single line.

01:25:18.488 --> 01:25:20.365
No grandkids, congratulations.

01:25:21.617 --> 01:25:23.039
Lor?

01:25:33.462 --> 01:25:34.930
What the... What?

01:25:43.347 --> 01:25:45.520
- What?
- Maybe we should Google it.

01:25:46.516 --> 01:25:49.231
- Google what?
- For false positives, you know.

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:51.608
It doesn't work like that. It's not AIDS.

01:25:51.688 --> 01:25:53.565
- I need to get a blood test.
- For AIDS?

01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:55.777
No! Mom! For this!

01:25:55.859 --> 01:25:57.406
- Are you here?
- Sorry.

01:25:57.486 --> 01:25:59.408
I'm pregnant! Okay?

01:25:59.488 --> 01:26:01.786
I'm too old to get an abortion. I can't...

01:26:02.741 --> 01:26:05.415
- This is real.
- Well, don't be sad.

01:26:07.245 --> 01:26:09.168
Don't be sad. Lori?

01:26:10.374 --> 01:26:11.921
Don't be sad.

01:26:13.210 --> 01:26:14.382
I'm not.

01:26:16.046 --> 01:26:17.093
You're not?

01:26:20.926 --> 01:26:23.140
- Mom!
- Okay, we're happy!

01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:24.722
Yes.

01:26:24.805 --> 01:26:26.148
Yes!

01:26:33.814 --> 01:26:35.532
My daughter was a surprise.

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:42.705
I'm gonna have to sell my house.

01:26:43.365 --> 01:26:45.584
Get something bigger, with carpets.

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:48.628
What am I gonna tell Jacob?

01:26:49.996 --> 01:26:52.044
I can't believe Dad's not around.

01:26:52.124 --> 01:26:53.751
Well, I'm around. So...

01:26:54.835 --> 01:26:55.961
I'm here.

01:26:56.545 --> 01:26:58.923
Yeah, I know. I know.

01:27:02.592 --> 01:27:03.718
Hello?

01:27:03.802 --> 01:27:06.430
Hey, it's Anna in Dr. Seagal's office.

01:27:06.513 --> 01:27:08.015
It's negative.

01:27:09.641 --> 01:27:10.767
Really?

01:27:11.351 --> 01:27:13.228
What about all those tests that I took?

01:27:13.311 --> 01:27:16.565
I don't know, but we tested your blood
and urine and you're not pregnant.

01:27:18.191 --> 01:27:20.569
Okay. Well, thanks for calling.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:25.494
- I don't understand.
- Google says here that,

01:27:25.574 --> 01:27:29.499
"A false positive could be
certain types of stomach tumors."

01:27:30.412 --> 01:27:32.164
Do you feel sick?

01:27:33.623 --> 01:27:35.962
Maybe you could
ask the doctor to test your blood

01:27:36.042 --> 01:27:38.507
- for other things like AIDS.
- I don't have AIDS.

01:27:38.587 --> 01:27:40.134
Well, I said "like" AIDS.

01:27:46.636 --> 01:27:48.600
I don't get it. It says here,

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:53.436
"If you have two lines then
it means you're ovu... lating."

01:27:59.983 --> 01:28:02.953
I've been peeing on ovulation sticks!

01:28:03.653 --> 01:28:04.779
What the hell?

01:28:05.238 --> 01:28:08.537
You bought me ovulation sticks!

01:28:08.617 --> 01:28:10.995
You understand
what you just put me through?

01:28:11.745 --> 01:28:14.710
I thought I was pregnant,
and then stomach tumors, and then...

01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:14.793
Oh, my God.

01:28:14.873 --> 01:28:16.125
Oh, my...

01:28:34.226 --> 01:28:37.355
Lor, I wasn't laughing at you.

01:28:38.271 --> 01:28:39.523
Honey.

01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:43.280
It's better anyway.
You didn't plan it, right?

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.237
- Right?
- I know, I just...

01:28:45.946 --> 01:28:49.200
I was so relieved
to have that decision made for me.

01:28:51.326 --> 01:28:52.543
Yeah.

01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:56.209
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

01:28:56.289 --> 01:28:57.632
For what, sweetie?

01:28:58.291 --> 01:28:59.918
For the way I am.

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:01.628
I love the way you are.

01:29:02.379 --> 01:29:05.132
I just... I just really miss him.

01:29:06.132 --> 01:29:08.100
You know, maybe he's not the guy for you.

01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:10.103
No, not Jacob.

01:29:10.637 --> 01:29:12.105
I miss Dad.

01:29:13.139 --> 01:29:14.641
I miss my dad.

01:29:15.642 --> 01:29:16.894
Yeah, me too.

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:21.985
You know, it's really hard
to look at you sometimes.

01:29:22.065 --> 01:29:23.362
Why?

01:29:25.318 --> 01:29:27.537
Because half the room's missing.

01:29:28.613 --> 01:29:30.115
And we're both alone.

01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:32.329
We're not alone.

01:29:32.409 --> 01:29:34.036
You're not alone.

01:29:45.964 --> 01:29:49.764
This is what you get for following
the black sheep across the country.

01:29:50.302 --> 01:29:52.805
Well, if you're black sheep
then I'm a black sheep.

01:29:54.764 --> 01:29:56.186
We're two black sheeps.

01:30:39.184 --> 01:30:40.652
It's me.

01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:14.807
It's ringing.

01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:21.522
Hello?

01:31:27.357 --> 01:31:28.609
Ma?

01:31:31.444 --> 01:31:32.570
Hi.

01:31:32.988 --> 01:31:34.240
Thank you.

01:31:37.450 --> 01:31:39.919
Hi. I didn't know...

01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:37.514
Joey, I don't know what you want, but...

01:32:40.013 --> 01:32:41.640
this is all I can do.

01:32:47.687 --> 01:32:49.275
Ma'am!

01:32:49.355 --> 01:32:51.198
You gotta be kidding me.

01:32:51.775 --> 01:32:53.446
What is that you're doing down there?

01:32:53.526 --> 01:32:54.652
Nothing!

01:32:55.111 --> 01:32:57.614
Ma'am, it's illegal
to be doing what you're doing.

01:32:57.697 --> 01:32:59.495
I need you to step out of the water, okay?

01:33:01.409 --> 01:33:04.582
I'm a resident of greater Los Angeles,

01:33:04.662 --> 01:33:06.790
and if you want me
to get out of this ocean,

01:33:06.873 --> 01:33:10.252
you're just gonna have to
come in and drag me the hell out!

01:33:13.671 --> 01:33:15.719
You think about who
your one phone call is.

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.122
Well, thank you very much.

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:31.545
It was my absolute pleasure.

01:34:33.126 --> 01:34:34.628
- Here, I'll take that.
- Yeah.

01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:45.726
Do you ever listen to Beyoncé?

01:34:46.764 --> 01:34:47.765
'Course.

01:34:47.849 --> 01:34:50.477
Yeah, you know,
she has this song, "I Was Here."

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:53.609
- Do you know that one?
- I don't think I do.

01:34:54.063 --> 01:34:58.614
Well, it goes, "I wanna leave
my footprints in the sands of time.

01:34:59.861 --> 01:35:01.863
Know that I left something behind.

01:35:01.946 --> 01:35:05.416
When I leave this world,
I leave no regrets.

01:35:06.492 --> 01:35:10.213
To know I left something to remember,
so they won't forget."

01:35:12.624 --> 01:35:15.173
- That sounds like a good one.
- Yeah.

01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:19.222
Well...

01:35:22.717 --> 01:35:25.515
When you bailed me out, did you do that

01:35:25.595 --> 01:35:27.597
because you're an officer of the law?

01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:32.564
No, that's actually the opposite
of what I usually do.

01:35:34.812 --> 01:35:37.110
I bailed you out as a friend.

01:35:50.119 --> 01:35:52.497
You wanna go to an action movie sometime?

01:35:54.791 --> 01:35:55.963
Definitely.

01:36:48.428 --> 01:36:49.805
Mom, where are you?

01:36:49.887 --> 01:36:51.601
You left in the middle of the night
and I got worried.

01:36:51.681 --> 01:36:54.229
Are you okay?
Can you call me when you get this?

01:36:54.309 --> 01:36:55.561
Love you.

01:36:57.353 --> 01:37:00.151
Hey, it's me. I hope you're not mad at me.

01:37:00.231 --> 01:37:02.359
Maybe just text me
and let me know that you got this.

01:37:02.817 --> 01:37:04.490
Okay, love you.

01:37:06.946 --> 01:37:09.661
Okay, I'm officially worried.
Where are you?

01:37:09.741 --> 01:37:12.244
Call me. This is weird.
This is your daughter.

01:37:15.246 --> 01:37:17.248
Hey, Marnie, it's Jillian.

01:37:17.332 --> 01:37:19.629
I was wondering if you could
watch Tehya for me today.

01:37:19.709 --> 01:37:21.552
Dani and I have a thing at seven.

01:37:22.795 --> 01:37:24.968
You're a lifesaver. Thank you.
Dani, we're leaving.

01:37:26.841 --> 01:37:29.344
- Grandma Marnie's here!
- Here she is. Here's my girl!

01:37:31.471 --> 01:37:35.061
Guess what?
We're gonna get to play all night.

01:37:35.141 --> 01:37:37.855
Bye. She's so sad to leave us.

01:37:37.935 --> 01:37:39.312
- She's distraught.
- Yeah.

01:37:39.395 --> 01:37:42.148
Well, we're matching.
This is like the second time.

01:37:42.231 --> 01:37:46.361
What should we do? How about a story?

01:37:46.444 --> 01:37:48.947
- Okay.
- Yes, would you like that?

01:38:17.225 --> 01:38:18.727
Hey, it's Lori. Leave a message.

01:38:20.645 --> 01:38:23.899
Anyways, I just thought I'd check in
and see what you're up to,

01:38:23.981 --> 01:38:25.695
and how your date went last night,

01:38:25.775 --> 01:38:28.364
or whatever it is you
wanted me to call it.

01:38:28.444 --> 01:38:31.698
I don't know how much longer I'm
going to have cell phone reception,

01:38:31.781 --> 01:38:34.579
'cause I'm going to Topanga
to see my friend with the chickens.

01:38:34.659 --> 01:38:39.039
And then, a Jason Statham movie...
His new movie.

01:38:39.122 --> 01:38:41.419
The one where he plays
the guy who stops time.

01:38:41.499 --> 01:38:42.921
It looks fabulous.

01:38:44.210 --> 01:38:47.339
And then tomorrow, I told Jillian

01:38:47.422 --> 01:38:49.385
that I would babysit for Tehya,

01:38:49.465 --> 01:38:52.344
so I'll be in the neighborhood,
if you want me to bring by bagels,

01:38:52.427 --> 01:38:56.017
or look at whatever you're working on
or whatever, you know.

01:38:56.097 --> 01:38:58.475
Because next weekend,
I think I'm gonna go to the desert.

01:38:58.558 --> 01:39:02.106
I'm thinking... I don't know
if I'll actually stay the night,

01:39:02.186 --> 01:39:06.316
but I'm thinking
I'd maybe like to see the desert.

01:39:06.399 --> 01:39:07.862
I mean, it's right there, right?

01:39:07.942 --> 01:39:09.819
Anyway, call me.

01:39:09.902 --> 01:39:11.279
Love you.
