00:00.584 --> 00:02.610
Previously on
The Shannara Chronicles...

00:02.617 --> 00:05.290
As king, I welcome
you to the Order of the Chosen.

00:05.296 --> 00:07.204
Thousands of years ago

00:07.210 --> 00:09.071
our Elven ancestors fought a war against

00:09.077 --> 00:10.811
an army of Demons.

00:10.817 --> 00:12.012
The Ellcrys is dying.

00:12.018 --> 00:14.081
And you are the only one
who can save it.

00:14.087 --> 00:16.483
Each leaf represents a single Demon.

00:16.489 --> 00:18.819
Once they begin to fall,
the creatures of darkness

00:18.825 --> 00:21.058
will be released from
the Forbidding, one by one.

00:22.495 --> 00:23.991
This is Allanon.

00:23.997 --> 00:25.893
The last Druid of Paranor.

00:25.899 --> 00:28.462
You are a Shannara,
Will. Never forget that.

00:28.468 --> 00:31.431
When you learn how to unlock
the power of the Elfstones,

00:31.437 --> 00:33.267
the Demons won't stand a chance.

00:33.273 --> 00:35.903
The world outside is dangerous, Wil.

00:35.909 --> 00:37.938
It's full of Gnomes, Trolls and Rovers.

00:40.380 --> 00:42.943
I know how it feels to be
trapped by your own life.

00:42.949 --> 00:44.978
I didn't exactly choose to be a Rover.

00:44.984 --> 00:46.947
You need to start trusting the Ellcrys,

00:46.953 --> 00:49.249
otherwise the three of you
will not make it to Safehold.

00:49.255 --> 00:50.384
Don't touch me!

00:50.390 --> 00:51.976
Something happen when people touch you?

00:51.983 --> 00:53.044
He's a seer.

00:53.051 --> 00:54.688
Your power may be growing,

00:54.694 --> 00:56.757
but be careful how you use it.

00:56.763 --> 00:59.760
Only a king knows
the weight of a crown.

00:59.766 --> 01:00.994
And if we die tonight,

01:01.000 --> 01:03.330
let us fall so the Ellcrys
may rise again!

01:03.336 --> 01:06.305
All hail king Ander!

01:06.311 --> 01:07.706
I love you, Wil Ohmsford.

01:07.712 --> 01:09.211
I love you, too. I always have.

01:09.342 --> 01:11.576
We all have a sacrifice to make.

01:11.582 --> 01:12.644
This is mine.

01:12.650 --> 01:13.979
Amberle, wait!

01:13.985 --> 01:15.592
You made me believe she could be saved.

01:15.599 --> 01:17.482
Instead, I lost another
person that I loved.

01:17.488 --> 01:19.498
I told you that magic
comes with a price.

01:19.504 --> 01:21.234
You didn't say it was Amberle's life.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.407
Don't you get it?
We all have a part to play.

01:25.491 --> 01:26.887
Go!

01:26.893 --> 01:28.889
I promised Eretria
I'd go back and find her.

01:28.895 --> 01:30.328
I'm not gonna lose her too.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:49.182 --> 01:50.644
It's you.

01:50.650 --> 01:52.980
Welcome back, Eretria.

01:52.986 --> 01:55.653
I've been waiting a very
long time for you.

01:59.792 --> 02:01.621
Forgive the disguise.

02:01.627 --> 02:03.523
Helps us blend in with the real trolls.

02:03.529 --> 02:05.129
I thought you were dead, Cogline.

02:09.469 --> 02:12.432
I spent 20 years wondering
what became of you.

02:12.438 --> 02:16.336
Now I see you here, alive.

02:16.342 --> 02:18.609
I promised your mother that
I would always protect you.

02:20.013 --> 02:23.176
But I knew that your destiny
would bring you back to me.

02:23.182 --> 02:25.583
Join us. Make a home here.

02:27.186 --> 02:29.049
My friends are gonna come
looking for me.

02:29.055 --> 02:30.550
Well, stay until they do.

02:30.556 --> 02:31.856
Choice is yours.

02:45.804 --> 02:46.851
_

03:12.580 --> 03:13.881
Were you following me?

03:13.887 --> 03:16.287
I thought you might get lonely
down here all by yourself.

03:18.037 --> 03:19.900
Check this out.

03:19.906 --> 03:21.234
The old man doesn't want us

03:21.240 --> 03:23.758
risking our life for this stuff.

03:23.764 --> 03:25.472
He'd freak out if anything
happened to you.

03:25.478 --> 03:27.541
I can take care of myself, Lyria.

03:27.547 --> 03:29.009
That's not the point.

03:29.015 --> 03:32.883
Wherever you go, I go. Remember?

03:44.163 --> 03:45.696
- Looks like we're late.
- Let's go.

03:49.050 --> 03:50.597
What took you so long?

03:50.603 --> 03:51.965
What'd ya find?

03:51.971 --> 03:53.300
This one's for Cogline.

03:53.306 --> 03:54.573
Oh, sweet!

03:54.579 --> 03:55.608
Here.

04:00.379 --> 04:01.418
Trolls!

04:05.051 --> 04:07.284
Get everyone out of here. Go!

06:10.142 --> 06:11.905
What took you so long?

06:55.121 --> 06:56.420
Eretria...

07:00.826 --> 07:03.356
A new darkness is coming.

07:03.362 --> 07:06.059
You must find Wil.

07:06.065 --> 07:08.065
The fate of the world depends on it.

08:28.347 --> 08:29.380
Welcome back.

08:32.518 --> 08:34.347
- How did I...
- Survive?

08:34.352 --> 08:35.385
I have no idea.

08:36.222 --> 08:37.450
But when I found you

08:37.456 --> 08:39.722
all you kept saying was "Amberle."

08:44.430 --> 08:47.327
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No.
You shouldn't be out of bed.

08:47.333 --> 08:48.665
I need to see Cogline.

08:55.107 --> 08:56.540
Up to your old Druid tricks?

08:58.110 --> 09:00.440
This isn't magic, it's science.

09:00.446 --> 09:02.342
I know. It's electricity.

09:02.348 --> 09:04.582
Oh. You're full of surprises.

09:07.119 --> 09:09.382
I'm glad you're feeling better. Hm.

09:09.388 --> 09:11.851
Lyria told me what happened today,

09:11.857 --> 09:13.323
it's a miracle you didn't drown.

09:17.062 --> 09:20.894
I would have, if it wasn't for Amberle.

09:20.900 --> 09:23.863
I know. I know it sounds
crazy, but she was down there.

09:23.869 --> 09:24.935
I saw her.

09:25.688 --> 09:27.155
When a person is drowning,

09:27.161 --> 09:28.795
their brain loses oxygen

09:28.801 --> 09:30.653
causing their mind to play
all sorts of tricks.

09:30.659 --> 09:32.091
No. But this was real.

09:32.311 --> 09:34.574
She reached out to me,
and she said Wil needs me.

09:34.580 --> 09:36.643
Maybe deep down that's
what you want to believe.

09:36.649 --> 09:39.779
Your way of dealing with the fact
that he never came looking for you.

09:39.785 --> 09:42.816
Eretria, you must let go
of your old life.

09:42.822 --> 09:45.789
Wherever Wil and Amberle are,
I'm sure they're safe.

09:50.029 --> 09:51.295
Yeah, I guess you're right.

09:53.132 --> 09:55.766
No doubt they're in Arborlon,
living happily ever after.

10:33.506 --> 10:34.838
Looks like you're next.

10:37.943 --> 10:38.976
You're not a gnome.

10:40.045 --> 10:42.575
Clearly nothing wrong with your eyes.

10:42.581 --> 10:45.111
I just thought all
Stor Healers were gnomes.

10:45.117 --> 10:46.212
They made an exception.

10:46.218 --> 10:47.981
What makes you so special?

10:47.987 --> 10:49.019
Nothing.

10:50.055 --> 10:51.551
Says here you burned yourself.

10:51.557 --> 10:52.756
Yeah.

10:53.859 --> 10:55.560
I wish it came with a better story,

10:55.566 --> 10:59.100
but the truth is I tripped
and fell into my own campfire.

11:02.768 --> 11:04.535
The good news is, you'll live.

11:11.443 --> 11:12.972
Apply this twice a day.

11:12.978 --> 11:14.645
It should minimize the scarring.

11:15.381 --> 11:16.643
Hey.

11:16.649 --> 11:19.450
You look really familiar.
What was your name?

11:21.554 --> 11:23.353
Around here, I'm just another Healer.

11:56.822 --> 11:59.519
It's been a year since
the demon attack.

11:59.525 --> 12:02.488
We need to get these people
back to their homes and farms.

12:02.494 --> 12:04.591
The Elven treasury is empty.

12:04.597 --> 12:06.459
We don't have the resources or manpower

12:06.465 --> 12:08.061
to rebuild their villages.

12:08.067 --> 12:10.184
Any word on help from the other races?

12:10.191 --> 12:12.498
They're still waiting for
approval from their counsels.

12:12.504 --> 12:14.000
Most of them would rather see

12:14.006 --> 12:16.002
the elves choked off than help.

12:16.008 --> 12:18.909
King Ander! Thanks for coming.

12:20.245 --> 12:21.625
There's something you need to see.

12:49.708 --> 12:51.070
The Crimson did this?

12:51.076 --> 12:53.406
I warned you that their
influence is growing.

12:53.412 --> 12:54.774
We need to find Riga

12:54.780 --> 12:56.716
and put him on trial for these crimes.

12:56.723 --> 12:58.478
General may be the head of the snake,

12:58.484 --> 13:01.047
but he's only voicing
what many people are feeling.

13:01.053 --> 13:03.416
General Riga and his men
are on the rampage.

13:03.422 --> 13:05.918
Killing anyone who refuses
to report a magic user.

13:05.924 --> 13:07.353
Giving the people an enemy

13:07.359 --> 13:08.792
and turning them away from you.

13:09.928 --> 13:11.094
He's rewarding hate.

14:43.216 --> 14:47.514
When the Warlock Lord's blade
called, you answered.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.882
So that together,

14:48.888 --> 14:53.320
we can take the first step
in resurrecting our master.

14:53.326 --> 14:58.229
Today you will be reborn...
As Mord Wraiths.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.230
Step forward.

15:06.005 --> 15:08.201
You will lead your brothers

15:08.207 --> 15:10.258
and you will bear the mark
of the snake.

15:10.265 --> 15:11.420
Yes.

16:13.839 --> 16:16.102
Behold.

16:16.108 --> 16:17.541
The heart of our dark master.

17:34.734 --> 17:35.822
Allanon.

17:38.132 --> 17:40.457
I sensed you tracking me
for months now.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.492
But it's too late.

17:45.498 --> 17:49.295
Resurrecting the Warlock Lord
is madness.

17:49.301 --> 17:51.802
But, sacrificing me to the Dagda Mor?

17:52.938 --> 17:54.801
Oh, that was perfectly acceptable.

17:54.807 --> 17:58.338
I regret what happened to you
and my part in it.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.206
But I was trying to save the Ellcrys.

18:00.212 --> 18:05.478
Is that what you told Amberle
when she sacrificed her life?

18:05.484 --> 18:06.550
Or Wil?

18:09.422 --> 18:11.151
You turned Catania against me.

18:11.157 --> 18:13.153
You brought that upon yourself.

18:13.159 --> 18:16.856
You allowed yourself to be
manipulated by the Dagda Mor.

18:16.862 --> 18:19.993
And now that sword is controlling you.

18:19.999 --> 18:23.934
It's guiding me, Allanon,
to my true potential.

18:25.004 --> 18:26.289
I'm gonna learn from the Druid

18:26.296 --> 18:28.735
who understood the true power of magic.

18:28.741 --> 18:32.009
Power is a curse for those who seek it.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.820
You're gonna die forgotten
and alone, Allanon.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.722
And the world won't even care.

19:22.728 --> 19:25.229
That is my burden to bear, not yours.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.635
Your master needs you. Now!

19:32.104 --> 19:33.170
Drink!

21:07.644 --> 21:08.806
You know who I am?

21:08.812 --> 21:09.844
General Riga.

21:11.714 --> 21:13.410
That's right

21:13.416 --> 21:15.446
and I'm on the hunt for magic users.

21:15.452 --> 21:18.519
You won't find any in there.
I'm just a simple farmer.

21:19.222 --> 21:20.354
I'm looking for someone.

21:21.724 --> 21:23.720
His name is Wil Ohmsford.

21:23.726 --> 21:24.859
He's a Shannara.

21:26.129 --> 21:27.391
One of those responsible

21:27.397 --> 21:29.560
for unleashing the Dagda Mor
and his demon army.

21:29.566 --> 21:31.532
No. I never heard of Wil Ohmsford.

21:33.236 --> 21:34.268
But...

21:35.605 --> 21:37.371
There's a Flick Ohmsford
down in Shady Vale.

21:37.974 --> 21:39.040
Good.

21:51.988 --> 21:53.121
A gift from the Crimson.

21:55.658 --> 21:57.025
Send them safely on their way.

22:00.997 --> 22:04.628
Dispatch a unit to Shady Vale.
Find this Flick Ohmsford.

22:04.634 --> 22:06.563
And what if the locals
don't co-operate?

22:06.569 --> 22:09.237
Well, then you burn the village
to the ground until you they do.

22:23.553 --> 22:25.149
Now, as you all know,

22:25.155 --> 22:28.285
Elven anatomy differs from other races.

22:28.291 --> 22:29.991
Their hearts are no exception.

22:31.794 --> 22:33.090
Can someone please tell me

22:33.096 --> 22:34.662
where I should make the next incision?

22:35.865 --> 22:38.166
Across the wall
of the right inferior atrium.

22:39.235 --> 22:40.535
Correct, Mr. Ohmsford.

22:41.171 --> 22:42.537
Please, take over.

23:16.606 --> 23:18.139
Mr. Ohmsford.

23:19.943 --> 23:22.109
Step outside. Now.

23:58.414 --> 23:59.513
Mr. Ohmsford...

24:02.819 --> 24:04.348
Your compassion for the patients

24:04.354 --> 24:07.188
and dedication to your studies
are impressive.

24:08.491 --> 24:10.358
Why do I sense there's a "but" coming?

24:11.828 --> 24:13.928
Takes more than that to be
a good healer.

24:15.698 --> 24:18.395
I don't think this is your calling.

24:18.401 --> 24:21.431
Slanter went out on a limb
to get me in here.

24:21.437 --> 24:23.834
Why do you dedicate yourself to medicine

24:23.840 --> 24:26.173
when you possess a far greater gift?

24:26.909 --> 24:28.972
Because magic has a price.

24:28.978 --> 24:31.341
A price that's too high.

24:31.347 --> 24:32.414
At least for me.

24:34.917 --> 24:37.014
You saved the world.

24:37.020 --> 24:40.984
As much as we help,
a Stor can never do that.

24:40.990 --> 24:43.887
I'm not interested in saving
the world anymore.

24:43.893 --> 24:45.393
Just the people that I care about.

24:46.896 --> 24:48.396
Please give me one more chance.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.467
One more, but that's it, Mr. Ohmsford.

24:59.309 --> 25:00.704
You should know.

25:00.710 --> 25:03.940
It wasn't Slanter who secured
your position here.

25:03.946 --> 25:05.179
It was Allanon.

25:37.580 --> 25:40.544
The skull of the Warlock Lord.

25:40.550 --> 25:42.579
The blade has told me who will know.

25:42.585 --> 25:43.751
Find the Shannara.

27:26.789 --> 27:28.355
I'm lost without you.

27:57.189 --> 27:58.555
Ouch.

28:03.529 --> 28:06.359
Okay. Good talk.

28:06.365 --> 28:08.899
Cogline said I need to let go
of my old life.

28:10.102 --> 28:11.268
I thought you already had?

28:13.138 --> 28:15.639
I guess, not talking about it
is different from letting go.

28:16.208 --> 28:17.637
We agreed.

28:17.643 --> 28:20.373
All that's important is who we are now.

28:20.379 --> 28:24.444
Whatever we were before doesn't matter.

28:24.450 --> 28:27.714
What does matter is that
the only time I feel real,

28:27.720 --> 28:28.986
is when I'm with you.

28:31.690 --> 28:33.190
Now you tell me something.

28:34.793 --> 28:35.826
Who's Amberle?

28:39.298 --> 28:41.698
She's probably the bravest
person I've ever met.

28:44.603 --> 28:46.699
Were you two ever together?

28:46.705 --> 28:48.171
No. Not like that.

28:51.276 --> 28:54.111
But I feel this connection
to her that I can't explain.

28:55.481 --> 28:57.243
And Wil?

28:57.249 --> 28:58.615
How does he fit into the picture?

29:00.686 --> 29:03.620
You talk in your sleep,
so I kinda pieced it together.

29:04.790 --> 29:05.822
Wil.

29:10.562 --> 29:12.925
Wil was the first person
to ever look at me

29:12.931 --> 29:14.064
and see someone good.

29:16.201 --> 29:18.531
I never thought I could
be anything more than a Rover,

29:18.537 --> 29:20.003
but he knew it all along.

29:22.775 --> 29:24.474
Are you still in love with him?

29:27.413 --> 29:29.146
His heart was always Amberle's.

29:30.783 --> 29:32.149
You didn't answer the question.

29:33.986 --> 29:34.988
No.

29:36.055 --> 29:37.087
Not anymore.

29:39.925 --> 29:41.191
I met a new person.

29:42.327 --> 29:44.027
She's kind of mysterious...

29:45.531 --> 29:47.431
Doesn't really like talking
about herself.

29:50.869 --> 29:52.736
But I'm hoping she'll open up to me.

30:04.416 --> 30:05.515
What's wrong?

30:06.885 --> 30:09.582
There's something
that I need to tell you.

30:09.588 --> 30:12.222
I should have told you before,
it's about Cogline.

30:13.992 --> 30:15.525
He's been lying to you.

30:20.766 --> 30:22.595
A week after you got here,

30:22.601 --> 30:24.267
Cogline called in all the scouts.

30:25.471 --> 30:27.533
Said some people
would be looking for you.

30:27.539 --> 30:29.202
Dangerous people.

30:29.208 --> 30:32.405
We had to prevent them
from ever finding you.

30:32.411 --> 30:35.879
Couple months later,
I saw the scouts in his lab.

30:37.382 --> 30:38.911
They said the Eretria problem

30:38.917 --> 30:40.246
had been taken care of

30:40.252 --> 30:42.452
and gave him something as proof.

30:43.889 --> 30:46.586
After that, all the patrols stopped.

30:46.592 --> 30:48.187
Do you know what the scouts gave him?

30:48.193 --> 30:49.322
I have no idea.

30:49.328 --> 30:50.423
But he's a pack rat

30:50.429 --> 30:52.829
so I'm sure it's somewhere in his lab.

30:55.033 --> 30:56.399
Then tonight we're finding it.

31:17.723 --> 31:19.189
I'm not looking for company.

31:20.125 --> 31:21.554
Sorry.

31:21.560 --> 31:24.524
You know, gotta be honest, Wil.

31:24.530 --> 31:27.260
This whole brooding,
tortured loner routine

31:27.266 --> 31:28.665
isn't really working for you.

31:32.404 --> 31:34.567
I'm surprised that the guy
who helped save

31:34.573 --> 31:35.868
the Four Lands from demons

31:35.874 --> 31:37.835
doesn't have people lining up
to buy him rounds.

31:39.244 --> 31:42.946
Or, uh, collect the bounty on his head.

31:52.324 --> 31:54.187
You're full of surprises.

31:54.193 --> 31:57.127
Not the first time a woman has
tried to take advantage of me.

31:58.497 --> 32:00.560
You come into the clinic with a story

32:00.566 --> 32:02.628
about how you burned yourself.

32:02.634 --> 32:04.530
Then I spot you sitting across the bar

32:04.536 --> 32:05.902
eyeing me for the last hour.

32:07.506 --> 32:10.670
See, if I stab an Elf right here

32:10.676 --> 32:12.772
above the abdomen and twist the blade,

32:12.778 --> 32:14.340
you'll bleed out in less than a minute.

32:16.615 --> 32:19.895
That's really fascinating,

32:19.902 --> 32:21.881
but I think you're gonna need
my help getting away

32:21.887 --> 32:24.421
from the real bounty hunters
sitting two tables down.

32:28.193 --> 32:30.489
That man and that woman.

32:30.495 --> 32:32.725
They had a third guy outside
ready to bag you,

32:32.731 --> 32:35.695
but I slit his throat before I came in.

32:35.701 --> 32:38.401
Which is how I got this card.

32:43.876 --> 32:45.575
Someone just sobered up real fast.

32:47.260 --> 32:48.780
I hope you know how to use that knife.

32:49.715 --> 32:51.607
Why are you helping me?

32:51.614 --> 32:53.134
I'll explain after we get out of here.

32:57.656 --> 32:58.918
You just picked me up,

32:58.924 --> 33:01.124
we're drunk and you're
taking me back to your place.

33:02.227 --> 33:03.793
Try and keep up. Come on.

33:10.502 --> 33:12.098
Excuse me.

33:12.104 --> 33:13.633
I'm about to get lucky here.

33:13.639 --> 33:15.101
So are we.

33:15.107 --> 33:18.074
We can do this the easy way,
or the hard way.

33:18.909 --> 33:20.108
Hard way works for me.

34:17.342 --> 34:20.139
You seriously had no idea you
were being hunted?

34:20.146 --> 34:22.609
I had heard rumors about some
extremist elves

34:22.614 --> 34:25.043
going after magic users,

34:25.050 --> 34:27.746
but Storlock is a neutral zone.

34:27.753 --> 34:29.949
Might want to tell that to the Crimson.

34:29.955 --> 34:31.655
Here. Let me help you.

34:43.636 --> 34:45.031
Thanks for your help.

34:45.036 --> 34:47.266
I didn't do it for thanks.

34:47.273 --> 34:48.672
I plan on collecting that favor.

34:51.110 --> 34:53.139
Look, I'm no healer
but that thing needs stitches.

34:53.145 --> 34:54.882
I'm gonna go get one
of your Stor friends.

34:56.614 --> 34:58.878
I was drunk and in a bar fight.

34:58.884 --> 35:00.358
I'm already on thin ice around here.

35:00.365 --> 35:02.515
They'd kick me out.

35:02.521 --> 35:05.022
So you're gonna stay here
and bleed out? Great plan.

35:06.358 --> 35:07.524
Hand me my jacket.

35:25.344 --> 35:27.073
Enjoy the show.

35:50.202 --> 35:52.169
How did this guy ever save the world?

35:57.009 --> 35:58.905
Cogline won't be long.

35:58.911 --> 36:00.077
Dinner is almost over.

36:09.088 --> 36:10.921
Look at all this stuff.

36:13.492 --> 36:14.925
Go check his desk.

36:46.825 --> 36:48.125
Hurry up.

37:01.874 --> 37:03.407
Can I help you?

37:06.612 --> 37:09.008
Wil did come looking for me, didn't he?

37:09.014 --> 37:10.510
This is his pendant.

37:10.516 --> 37:13.817
Lyria, I need to speak
with Eretria alone.

37:23.762 --> 37:25.640
Knew I should've thrown
that damn thing away.

37:26.932 --> 37:28.027
He searched for months,

37:28.033 --> 37:29.662
but I prevented him from finding you.

37:29.668 --> 37:31.798
Why? Why would you do that?

37:31.804 --> 37:33.170
Because he's a Shannara.

37:34.006 --> 37:35.101
When they come knocking,

37:35.107 --> 37:36.836
that means people are gonna get hurt,

37:36.842 --> 37:38.671
- maybe die.
- So you lied!

37:38.677 --> 37:39.973
I was trying to protect you.

37:39.979 --> 37:41.674
I don't need protection.

37:41.680 --> 37:43.280
I want the truth, for once.

37:46.018 --> 37:48.881
I promised your mother that I
would guard you with my life.

37:48.887 --> 37:52.089
And for 20 years,
I thought I failed her.

37:53.258 --> 37:54.791
I couldn't live with myself.

37:56.128 --> 37:57.423
I didn't want to lose you again.

37:57.429 --> 37:58.558
I know you loved her,

37:58.564 --> 38:00.030
but that wasn't your choice to make.

38:01.400 --> 38:02.699
Don't go.

38:04.336 --> 38:06.733
Please ignore the vision
of Amberle, I beg you.

38:06.739 --> 38:08.038
You know I can't do that.

38:11.744 --> 38:12.976
Eretria.

38:16.048 --> 38:18.115
Sometimes the truth
doesn't set you free.

38:20.319 --> 38:22.052
It brings you more pain.

38:25.257 --> 38:27.057
That'll be for me to discover.

39:20.739 --> 39:22.238
What happened?

39:23.208 --> 39:25.237
A human village was attacked.

39:25.243 --> 39:27.106
We're setting up triage stations.

39:27.112 --> 39:28.607
It's gonna be a long night.

39:28.613 --> 39:29.909
Which village?

39:29.915 --> 39:31.177
Shady Vale.

39:31.183 --> 39:32.515
Shady...

39:33.251 --> 39:34.617
Uncle Flick!

39:39.224 --> 39:40.623
Uncle Flick!

39:41.193 --> 39:42.888
Wil!

39:42.894 --> 39:45.891
Wil Ohmsford, is that you?

39:45.897 --> 39:47.960
Dax. Hey.

39:47.966 --> 39:51.897
The Crimson, they were looking for you.

39:51.903 --> 39:53.399
You can't stay here.

39:53.405 --> 39:54.667
What about my uncle?

39:54.673 --> 39:56.836
I told Flick to hide.

39:56.842 --> 39:58.708
I hope they didn't find him.

40:00.245 --> 40:01.811
Let's get him to surgery.

40:11.323 --> 40:13.019
You sure about this, Eretria?

40:13.025 --> 40:14.920
We're in Rover territory.

40:14.926 --> 40:16.555
We've got to keep moving.

40:16.561 --> 40:18.128
It's a long way to Arborlon.

40:28.306 --> 40:29.672
Stay close.

40:40.652 --> 40:41.814
Lyria!

40:41.820 --> 40:43.920
Bad move if you wanna live.

41:25.464 --> 41:26.996
Shannara.

41:52.390 --> 41:53.723
Hey.

41:58.630 --> 41:59.696
I'm right here.

42:08.106 --> 42:10.536
Hey, that's not gonna buy us much time.

42:10.542 --> 42:12.518
We have to hurry before
that thing comes back.

42:13.044 --> 42:14.640
Wait.

42:14.646 --> 42:16.075
You have magic?

42:16.081 --> 42:17.576
Not much gets by you.

42:17.582 --> 42:19.945
Let's go.

42:19.951 --> 42:22.085
Not until you tell me what you want.

42:23.955 --> 42:25.351
The Druid.

42:25.357 --> 42:26.519
Allanon.

42:26.525 --> 42:28.220
I need your help to find him.

42:28.226 --> 42:29.292
Why?

42:30.795 --> 42:32.195
Because he's my father.
