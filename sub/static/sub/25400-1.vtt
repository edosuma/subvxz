00:48.215 --> 00:50.707
Oh my god, look at that.

00:50.926 --> 00:52.133
It's so sad they all messed

00:52.344 --> 00:54.427
their lives up, those people.

00:56.598 --> 00:59.511
Say, why did the
bum vote for Obama?

01:02.396 --> 01:04.308
You're supposed to say, why.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.515
Okay, why?

01:06.733 --> 01:08.395
'Cause he
wanted change!

01:08.610 --> 01:12.650
Wow, that's
funny Mr. Cohen.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.989
Hey, you remember
my cousin Matt, the actor?

01:18.203 --> 01:19.489
Mm-hmm.

01:19.705 --> 01:20.866
Yeah, he's doing a
show on Broadway now

01:21.081 --> 01:23.664
and we're gonna tear
up the town together.

01:23.875 --> 01:24.911
Wow.

01:25.127 --> 01:27.084
Yeah, he knows all
the real cool spots,

01:27.296 --> 01:29.879
real underground
places, you know?

01:32.759 --> 01:35.877
I thought you were going
drop me off in the Village.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.587
Mr.
Cohen, I told you,

01:37.806 --> 01:39.388
your mom said that
I need to make sure

01:39.600 --> 01:41.432
you get into your meeting.

01:58.410 --> 01:59.696
Traitor.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.191
Oh gosh.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.738
Hi everyone.

02:37.949 --> 02:39.690
Welcome to the summer
semester of Connections.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.993
Over here on this table
we've got some clipboards,

02:42.204 --> 02:43.615
that's where you'll register.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.413
If you have any
questions about Lit Club

02:46.625 --> 02:48.366
you can ask Mar.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.577
Paint and Pottery
you can ask Annie,

02:50.796 --> 02:53.539
she knows everything there
is about those groups,

02:53.757 --> 02:56.090
and if you have any
questions about Drama Dreams

02:56.301 --> 02:58.418
we have Sarah and Sammy.

02:58.637 --> 03:01.220
They can tell you anything
you need to know about those.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.593
Would you like to talk a
little bit about Drama Dreams?

03:03.809 --> 03:04.515
Yes.

03:04.726 --> 03:05.557
Okay.

03:05.769 --> 03:06.725
Yes, Dorsey.

03:06.937 --> 03:08.473
All right, here you go.

03:10.357 --> 03:11.768
Hi everyone, welcome.

03:11.983 --> 03:16.694
Drama Dreams is a wonderful,
magnificent opportunity

03:16.905 --> 03:20.615
and way to shine and do
a little mix and match

03:20.826 --> 03:24.410
and you do a great deal of
acting and improvisation

03:24.621 --> 03:28.205
and spontaneous performances
that are so flexible.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.500
You go with the flow.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.577
And it's very unscripted, so...

03:34.631 --> 03:36.213
This is
such a good party.

03:36.425 --> 03:37.586
Yeah.

03:37.801 --> 03:40.168
The
music's really great.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.798
Because if you
saw what happened

03:42.013 --> 03:45.051
with Bernie Madoff and
all the other people,

03:45.267 --> 03:47.384
and AIG and Lehman Brothers.

03:47.602 --> 03:51.516
We were kinda like bookies
or so I found out later on

03:51.732 --> 03:52.973
and then kinda like...

03:53.191 --> 03:54.978
Wait, who's Bernie Madoff?

03:55.193 --> 03:58.652
He's a man who
ripped off investors.

03:58.864 --> 04:01.857
His initials are BM
for a good reason.

04:02.951 --> 04:05.989
Because he is a
human bowel movement.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.947
I know it's your
first time here,

04:09.166 --> 04:12.955
downstairs there's I
think this juice bar.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.503
They've got this really
good kale shake down there

04:15.714 --> 04:19.378
if you wanna do a
little juicin' with me.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.256
What is with the
fruity music in this place.

04:22.471 --> 04:25.885
You have a problem
with the music?

04:26.099 --> 04:28.637
Oh no man, it's cool,
it's cool, I'm good.

04:29.394 --> 04:32.011
Who's the new initiate
and what's wrong with him?

04:32.230 --> 04:33.437
Well I
guess it's just,

04:33.648 --> 04:36.482
you know, sensory overload.

04:36.693 --> 04:40.232
I don't have a problem,
I'm just passing through.

04:40.447 --> 04:43.315
I bet you say that
to all the boys.

04:45.494 --> 04:46.450
Mom!

04:47.579 --> 04:49.616
I'm not going back there!

04:51.500 --> 04:52.707
Hold on.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.079
Mom!

04:57.130 --> 05:00.498
I said I'm not going back there!

05:00.717 --> 05:01.707
You wanna go to jail, David?

05:01.927 --> 05:04.419
You want to ruin
your father's life?

05:04.638 --> 05:06.345
Dad, make her stop!

05:08.058 --> 05:09.845
I mean, I know she hates me

05:10.060 --> 05:13.269
and she just wants
me to roll up and die

05:13.480 --> 05:16.268
and wants me to jump
off a goddamn roof.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.475
David, give it a rest, okay?

05:18.693 --> 05:21.902
It's not therapy, it's
a fruit cake place.

05:22.113 --> 05:25.948
Like the judge said, you
show up, you sign your name,

05:26.159 --> 05:28.651
six weeks later, dismissed.

05:28.870 --> 05:32.614
Maybe next time, don't
tell pig jokes to a cop.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.121
And what the hell
am I going to tell Angie?

05:36.336 --> 05:37.167
Who's Angie?

05:37.379 --> 05:39.746
The girl
that I'm seeing.

05:39.965 --> 05:41.172
I thought her
name was Melinda.

05:41.383 --> 05:43.420
No, that didn't work out
between me and Melinda.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.001
If Angie has a
problem with this,

05:45.220 --> 05:47.303
her mother can give me a call.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.014
Ah!

05:54.229 --> 05:55.436
David please.

05:57.315 --> 06:00.228
Sorry, I can't
help it, I'm trying.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.026
I don't belong there mom.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.524
I don't like the
look of the people

06:04.739 --> 06:06.355
at that place any
better than you do,

06:06.575 --> 06:08.237
but if you don't do this,

06:08.451 --> 06:09.783
you won't be able
to leave the state.

06:09.995 --> 06:12.703
No Florida, no beach club.

06:12.914 --> 06:13.825
You'll spend the
rest of the year

06:14.040 --> 06:16.248
stuck up here with aunt Rudy.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.825
Is that what you want?

06:18.044 --> 06:18.784
No.

06:19.546 --> 06:20.502
Just get it over with then

06:20.714 --> 06:22.626
so everything can
go back to normal.

06:25.844 --> 06:29.303
Oh sweetheart,
come let's have some fruit.

06:29.514 --> 06:31.676
You go lie down with some fruit,

06:31.892 --> 06:36.478
maybe a cool bath, your PJs?

07:18.146 --> 07:19.512
Hi, I'm Mar.

07:19.731 --> 07:20.562
What's your name?

07:20.774 --> 07:21.935
My name is Sammy.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.187
It's nice to meet you, Sammy.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.938
It's nice to meet you, Mar.

07:26.154 --> 07:29.864
I'm so happy that you are
here in this organization

07:30.075 --> 07:32.909
that my parents
really helped found.

07:33.954 --> 07:34.990
That's so...

07:35.288 --> 07:38.247
And Connections
is a branch of that.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.745
Oops, sorry to
cut you off Sammy,

07:40.961 --> 07:44.250
I have trouble reading
non-verbal cues

07:44.464 --> 07:46.456
because of my vision impairment.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.049
That's okay, Mar.

07:56.267 --> 07:59.226
I'm always respectful
to people around me.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.554
Their needs and their wishes.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.389
That's so cool.

08:05.568 --> 08:08.527
Mar and Sammy that was
great, thank you so much.

08:08.738 --> 08:09.603
Who wants to go next?

08:11.616 --> 08:12.732
Sarah, all right.

08:12.951 --> 08:15.568
Who's gonna partner with Sarah?

08:15.787 --> 08:17.653
Andrew, how about you?

08:17.872 --> 08:20.455
Haven't heard from
you much today.

08:23.545 --> 08:24.285
Okay.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.664
Hey, David.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.376
We're gonna stick
with the same thing,

08:32.595 --> 08:34.461
friendly conversations,
with people

08:34.681 --> 08:37.674
who we maybe have just met
or don't know very well.

08:37.892 --> 08:38.881
Does that sound okay?

08:39.102 --> 08:40.558
Yeah, that sounds like a plan.

08:40.770 --> 08:41.510
All right.

08:41.980 --> 08:44.188
David, sound okay to you?

08:44.399 --> 08:45.355
Yeah.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.399
Okay, go for it.

08:47.610 --> 08:51.524
So David, what would
you like to talk about?

08:51.740 --> 08:56.986
Do you like to speak
about movies, operas,

08:57.203 --> 09:00.241
ballets, Broadway musicals?

09:00.457 --> 09:01.664
No.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.161
Me neither.

09:03.501 --> 09:06.084
I'm not really crazy
about speaking about

09:06.296 --> 09:08.288
any of that kind of stuff.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.546
Yes, Sarah.

09:13.762 --> 09:17.597
Dorsey, David's being
really quiet, and shy.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.343
He's not participating.

09:19.559 --> 09:23.143
He's not contributing to his
fair share in the conversation.

09:23.354 --> 09:27.519
He's just being so,
really in dead silence.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.691
So let's ask the
group what they think

09:29.903 --> 09:33.396
could help David be more
involved in the conversation.

09:33.615 --> 09:37.404
I think Sarah, threw a
little too much information

09:37.619 --> 09:39.531
at David all at once.

09:39.746 --> 09:42.580
Sometimes, when you're in a
conversation with someone new,

09:42.791 --> 09:45.625
that's not good,
it can scare them.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.451
Any
other suggestions?

09:47.670 --> 09:50.413
You cannot bring up
a conversation topic,

09:50.632 --> 09:52.498
if neither of you is interested.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.926
So let's find a
common interest.

09:56.137 --> 09:59.380
David, you can even
pick the interest.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.215
How about the Brooklyn Bridge.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.016
Oh, okay!

10:03.394 --> 10:05.260
That sounds wonderful.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.856
What do you really
love and enjoy the most

10:09.067 --> 10:12.185
about doing at the
Brooklyn Bridge,

10:12.403 --> 10:15.521
I mean we should really make
some plans to go together.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.197
That would be very
interesting for both of us.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.491
And we could both have a
wonderful time together.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.490
We can both jump
off the bridge.

10:24.290 --> 10:28.409
Dorsey, David's really,
really not cooperating with me.

10:30.588 --> 10:33.126
I can't believe she
actually took me so seriously.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.833
Well David, I actually
think that this would be

10:36.052 --> 10:40.547
a really wonderful homework
assignment for the two of you.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.848
You can practice those
conversation skills

10:43.059 --> 10:47.099
and come back and share
that with the group.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.722
David, I
need you to cooperate.

10:50.775 --> 10:51.765
Just missed my
freakin' elevator.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.101
I just want to get
out of this building.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.730
David, that's very irrelevant.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.278
We need to focus on getting

10:56.489 --> 10:57.775
our homework
assignment completed

10:57.991 --> 10:59.152
that Dorsey assigned us to.

10:59.367 --> 11:00.448
This is very exciting for me!

11:00.660 --> 11:01.320
Maybe for you.

11:01.536 --> 11:02.652
We wanna report,

11:02.871 --> 11:05.079
my job and my
responsibility, David,

11:05.290 --> 11:07.282
is to report to Dorsey
and keep her posted

11:07.500 --> 11:09.036
on how everything
goes that we observe

11:09.252 --> 11:10.459
at the Brooklyn Bridge.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.332
We have to make this plan.

11:12.547 --> 11:14.038
We were the one that committed.

11:14.257 --> 11:17.796
We have to stick to our
commitments and plan properly.

11:18.011 --> 11:18.797
Bye!

11:19.137 --> 11:20.173
David we have to make plans,

11:20.388 --> 11:21.629
we're not planning properly,

11:21.848 --> 11:23.089
we have to plan properly David.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.469
See you later.

11:24.684 --> 11:25.970
Have a nice life.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.413
- Hi!
- Hi!

11:48.625 --> 11:49.331
You must be Angie.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.407
David?

11:50.627 --> 11:52.664
- I'm David, that's right.
- So nice to meet you.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.040
- It's great to meet you too.
- I didn't know if you were

11:54.255 --> 11:55.962
gonna recognize me
from the website.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.585
You look even more
beautiful than in person

11:57.800 --> 11:58.790
than on your profile.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.967
Oh my god, thank you.

12:01.179 --> 12:02.260
Oh my gosh, sorry.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.213
I'm usually not this
nervous, but you know

12:04.432 --> 12:06.970
I rarely meet
nice, normal, guys.

12:07.185 --> 12:07.925
Thank you.

12:08.144 --> 12:08.975
Thanks.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.930
So uh, do you want anything
to eat or anything?

12:13.149 --> 12:14.765
You seem hungry or
nervous or something.

12:14.984 --> 12:19.228
No, I'm on this no-carb diet,

12:19.447 --> 12:21.359
so that's all you.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.408
Did you know that milk
had carbs in them?

12:24.619 --> 12:25.951
Wow, milk had carbs.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.529
So I'm excited about
this U2 concert

12:28.748 --> 12:29.909
tonight, you know?
- Yes, me too!

12:30.124 --> 12:31.660
I love U2!

12:31.876 --> 12:33.492
I love Bono, I'm
obsessed with him.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.418
I know everything about him,

12:35.630 --> 12:38.543
like his date of
birth: May 10th, 1960.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.465
Whoa, 1960.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.839
You kind of look like
him a little bit.

12:43.054 --> 12:43.965
Hello, hello!

12:45.807 --> 12:46.467
- Yeah, the glasses.
- That's good.

12:46.683 --> 12:47.969
That's good.

12:48.184 --> 12:51.643
Um, do you always keep
your sunglasses on?

12:54.524 --> 12:55.230
Sorry.

13:00.363 --> 13:01.979
It's my allergies.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.405
Do you need a napkin?

13:03.616 --> 13:04.732
No, I just...

13:05.743 --> 13:08.451
so, um, you into sports at all?

13:09.497 --> 13:10.453
Um, sort of.

13:10.665 --> 13:12.281
You heard of Kobe Bryant?

13:12.500 --> 13:16.084
Yeah, this morning he was
traded to the LA Rapers.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.499
I'm sorry, that wasn't funny.

13:18.715 --> 13:19.956
I got a funnier one.

13:20.174 --> 13:25.215
My two favorite things,
Jello pudding and rape.

13:25.513 --> 13:28.551
I'm just gonna
run to the bathroom.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.592
Excuse me, I'm sorry,
excuse me, sorry.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.094
Angie!

14:09.557 --> 14:10.513
Ang!

14:12.810 --> 14:13.516
Hi.

15:59.584 --> 16:03.544
Such a
fucking bum.

16:04.589 --> 16:06.831
Fucking bum!

16:10.261 --> 16:11.968
Welcome
to Drama Therapy

16:12.180 --> 16:13.887
I'm so happy
to be here Delilah.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.509
Excellent,
so this summer,

16:15.725 --> 16:18.058
we're actually gonna be
working towards a performance.

16:18.269 --> 16:18.929
Really?

16:19.145 --> 16:20.511
Oooh, wow!

16:20.730 --> 16:22.722
Yeah, and what
we're gonna be doing

16:22.940 --> 16:26.183
is we're going to be
exploring who we are

16:26.402 --> 16:27.768
and then we're gonna be able to

16:27.987 --> 16:29.819
show that to the world.

16:30.031 --> 16:32.148
And so one of the things
we're gonna do this summer

16:32.366 --> 16:34.904
is we're going to
create our performance

16:35.119 --> 16:37.281
around the idea of superheroes.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.704
Ooh!

16:38.915 --> 16:40.702
So what I want you guys
to be thinking about,

16:40.917 --> 16:42.749
think about if you
had a superhero power,

16:42.960 --> 16:44.292
what would it be?

16:44.504 --> 16:45.494
I love it.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.045
That is fantastic!

16:47.632 --> 16:50.295
I love it, it's just
what I've wanted for years.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.357
David.

17:07.568 --> 17:08.398
What happened?

17:08.611 --> 17:09.476
What?

17:09.694 --> 17:12.403
You missed our
homework assignment.

17:12.615 --> 17:13.651
What homework assignment?

17:14.325 --> 17:16.066
Remember, we were
supposed to write a report

17:16.285 --> 17:17.445
about the Brooklyn Bridge.

17:17.662 --> 17:18.527
Look, how about this.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.320
Why don't you do this
professionally, okay?

17:21.540 --> 17:22.952
I'm gonna pay you
money to do this.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.374
I mean, you want money.

17:24.627 --> 17:25.583
How much do you want, $20?

17:25.877 --> 17:27.540
David, that's
not the assignment,

17:27.755 --> 17:29.212
you're giving me
a really hard time

17:29.423 --> 17:31.836
which is completely not okay,
completely unacceptable.

17:32.051 --> 17:36.170
Look David, if you're not
gonna cooperate with me

17:36.389 --> 17:37.596
and contribute to
your fair share,

17:37.807 --> 17:39.594
I'm going to advocate myself

17:39.809 --> 17:41.220
and speak my mind to Dorsey

17:41.435 --> 17:43.643
'cause this is
completely unacceptable.

17:44.355 --> 17:46.142
Okay, you want to go
to the Brooklyn Bridge,

17:46.357 --> 17:48.349
we'll go to the
Brooklyn Bridge, okay?

17:48.568 --> 17:49.934
We'll go to the
Brooklyn Bridge, okay?

17:50.152 --> 17:51.393
Will that get you off my case?

17:51.612 --> 17:53.228
What does off your case mean?

17:53.447 --> 17:55.655
It means
you'll be satisfied.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.482
Very much so.

17:57.702 --> 17:58.909
Taxi!

17:59.120 --> 18:01.954
Um, I find
it really really scary.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.577
But I feel so much
safer on the bus,

18:04.792 --> 18:06.374
and the only way to get home

18:06.586 --> 18:09.294
to my grandmother's home
safe and sound is the bus,

18:09.505 --> 18:11.041
and taxis are so expensive

18:11.257 --> 18:12.873
and I find them
so nerve-wracking.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.503
What are you Rain
Man or something?

18:14.719 --> 18:17.553
I mean, you have to have
a system for everything,

18:17.763 --> 18:20.847
gotta go to Kmart, 41
Oak Street, lights at 11.

18:21.058 --> 18:21.844
Don't you just want to live

18:22.059 --> 18:24.267
without going according
to the system,

18:24.478 --> 18:26.640
without sticking
to the line once?

18:27.440 --> 18:28.772
Believe me, I took the bus once,

18:28.983 --> 18:31.976
it was a messed up
experience for me.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.857
I got on the bus, it
was goddamned crowded,

18:35.072 --> 18:37.155
I felt like a sardine,
then when I sat down,

18:37.366 --> 18:39.107
this homeless guy got up to me

18:39.327 --> 18:42.536
and started harassing
the shit out of me

18:42.747 --> 18:44.659
and I felt like yelling
out hobophobic slurs,

18:44.874 --> 18:46.615
not homophobic, hobophobic...

18:46.834 --> 18:47.665
What's Hobophobic?

18:47.877 --> 18:49.960
It's a phobia against bums.

18:50.171 --> 18:51.412
Look, it's one thing if you want

18:51.631 --> 18:53.247
to take the bus by yourself,

18:53.466 --> 18:55.253
you can do whatever the
hell you want on your own,

18:55.593 --> 18:57.209
but when you're with
me, let's take a cab.

18:57.428 --> 19:00.387
Buses are for paupers,
and cabs are for

19:00.598 --> 19:02.555
the prince and the princess.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.058
You know, why don't
you just sit back,

19:05.269 --> 19:06.510
lay back and enjoy the ride.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.310
Okay.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.479
So how much
do I owe you, sir?

19:10.691 --> 19:11.522
$7.50.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.350
Here you go, $20.

19:13.569 --> 19:14.525
Keep the change.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.109
C'mon

19:33.506 --> 19:35.873
C'mon, come join me David!

19:36.092 --> 19:38.300
I'm having a wonderful time!

19:38.511 --> 19:40.594
My first time ever at
the Brooklyn Bridge!

19:40.805 --> 19:43.172
It's a gorgeous bird's-eye view!

19:59.865 --> 20:02.107
Where are
you going, David?

20:02.326 --> 20:03.362
I'm free now.

20:03.577 --> 20:06.069
But, how
am I getting home?

20:06.288 --> 20:07.495
How do you usually get home?

20:07.707 --> 20:08.663
I plan to take my bus.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.240
So then, take the bus.

20:10.459 --> 20:13.918
The bus from the
JCC is the only way

20:14.130 --> 20:16.838
I know how to get home to my
grandmother's home safely,

20:17.049 --> 20:18.381
and I count 13 stops.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.049
Oh Jesus.

20:20.261 --> 20:21.672
How old are you Sarah?

20:21.887 --> 20:23.378
David, I'm 24.

20:23.597 --> 20:25.338
And how long have you
been living in New York?

20:25.558 --> 20:27.641
I've been living in New
York City my whole life

20:27.852 --> 20:30.219
since I was a little born child.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.395
So you mean to tell me
that you've been in this town

20:32.606 --> 20:35.144
for 24 years and you
don't know how to get

20:35.359 --> 20:36.895
to your grandmother's
house from here?

20:37.111 --> 20:38.977
Well, the JCC,
the bus from the JCC

20:39.196 --> 20:41.279
is the only way I
know how to get home.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.607
That's the only way.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.326
You happy now?

20:46.537 --> 20:49.496
I had to take you all the
way back to the JC bus stop.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.573
I guess you want to take
the bus, we'll take the,

20:51.792 --> 20:54.830
look there we go, it's
your bus stop right there.

20:55.045 --> 20:56.957
Okay, take the bus, okay?

20:57.965 --> 20:58.705
What?

20:59.967 --> 21:00.673
Um.

21:02.470 --> 21:03.426
Um.

21:03.637 --> 21:04.468
Yeah?

21:04.680 --> 21:06.262
Um, David.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.555
What?

21:07.892 --> 21:10.851
Um, what about, what
about, what about.

21:11.061 --> 21:11.926
What happened?

21:12.313 --> 21:14.726
When are we gonna finish
our homework assignment?

21:14.940 --> 21:15.600
At the Brooklyn Bridge?

21:15.816 --> 21:17.057
We were there all day?

21:17.276 --> 21:18.107
We just did.

21:18.319 --> 21:19.560
But it's not complete,

21:19.779 --> 21:22.362
we're supposed to write
a report about it.

21:22.573 --> 21:25.190
I don't know, do it
with one of your friends.

21:25.409 --> 21:27.526
But David, I
really feel strongly

21:27.745 --> 21:29.077
about doing this with you,

21:29.288 --> 21:31.200
I really, really
wanna do it with you

21:31.415 --> 21:35.910
because I find you really
smoking hot and so sexy.

22:06.492 --> 22:09.530
Hey Mom, is it
okay if Geraldo drives me

22:09.745 --> 22:11.202
into the city today?

22:11.413 --> 22:14.247
It's a Sunday, what are
you doing in the city?

22:14.458 --> 22:17.542
I just feel like
hanging out and stuff.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.624
You know, for that group.

22:20.840 --> 22:21.796
I didn't think you were forced

22:22.007 --> 22:23.373
to go there on the weekend.

22:23.592 --> 22:26.335
Do I need to make a call
to that woman, Dorothy?

22:26.554 --> 22:27.590
No no no, it's not that.

22:27.805 --> 22:29.671
It's this voluntary
thing, you know?

22:29.890 --> 22:31.097
Voluntary?

22:31.308 --> 22:33.550
I just figured I'd
get extra credit.

22:33.769 --> 22:37.729
They'd let me out earlier for
like good behavior and stuff.

22:38.524 --> 22:41.733
You're here to
audition for my play.

22:42.486 --> 22:44.773
A lot of you are vying
for the same part.

22:44.989 --> 22:47.481
I hope that this does not cause

22:47.700 --> 22:50.488
any problems with
your relationships.

22:50.703 --> 22:54.287
These pages aren't
numbered but flip the page.

22:55.624 --> 22:58.207
Here scene three,
do you see it Sarah?

23:00.713 --> 23:01.874
Pardon me pretty lady,

23:02.089 --> 23:04.581
I couldn't help but
notice you in tears.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.041
What seems to be the trouble?

23:06.260 --> 23:07.592
I'd love to help.

23:18.314 --> 23:19.896
David, you made it!

23:20.107 --> 23:21.564
I want you to
audition for my play,

23:21.775 --> 23:23.641
for the leading role
of Travis McHenry.

23:25.112 --> 23:28.605
You look just like my
idol that I have loved

23:28.824 --> 23:31.191
ever since I was a
teen, he's on a show

23:31.410 --> 23:33.572
that did not last very long

23:33.787 --> 23:35.619
but it's called Malibu Mohawks.

23:35.831 --> 23:36.537
Oh, Malibu Mohawks?

23:36.749 --> 23:38.911
My cousin was on that show.

23:39.877 --> 23:42.460
- Your cousin?
- Matt Cone, Matt Cone!

23:42.671 --> 23:43.912
Matt Cone's your cousin?

23:44.131 --> 23:45.542
He's my cousin.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.670
He's more like a brother to me

23:47.885 --> 23:49.501
'cause I really worship him.
- Matt Cone is your cousin?

23:49.720 --> 23:50.585
Yeah!

23:50.804 --> 23:51.965
Like a brother to you?

23:52.181 --> 23:53.467
Just tell me why
he's your idol, huh?

23:53.682 --> 23:54.513
Why do you love him so much?

23:54.725 --> 23:57.342
He looks like the person

23:57.561 --> 24:01.054
who really can sweep
me off my feet.

24:01.357 --> 24:03.565
And I know that he is
as wonderful,

24:03.776 --> 24:07.269
he's as fancy on the inside
as he is on the outside.

24:07.488 --> 24:09.024
Okay, what is it
you want me to do?

24:09.239 --> 24:12.823
I want you to try on
some clothes for Travis.

24:13.035 --> 24:15.903
Why don't we try
on this beautiful,

24:16.121 --> 24:18.613
Handsome, white shirt.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.866
I want to see how
you look in it.

24:21.919 --> 24:23.535
- What the hell is this?
- C'mon David.

24:23.796 --> 24:24.627
This looks kind
of gay, no offense.

24:24.838 --> 24:26.500
Travis is bi-sexual.

24:26.715 --> 24:27.330
Why?

24:27.549 --> 24:28.710
Whoa, whoa.

24:28.926 --> 24:30.883
I'm not going to play gay...

24:31.095 --> 24:32.051
I think you can...

24:32.262 --> 24:34.254
I like women you know?

24:34.473 --> 24:36.465
Are you sure?

24:36.684 --> 24:37.720
Yes.

24:37.935 --> 24:40.552
This is a man's shirt.

24:41.063 --> 24:42.179
Travis is a man.

24:42.398 --> 24:45.562
It says Ann Taylor Loft.

24:46.068 --> 24:48.310
Ann Taylor is the designer.

24:48.529 --> 24:49.895
Yeah, that's a
woman's designer.

24:50.114 --> 24:53.983
She's the designer, she
doesn't wear the shirt.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.534
The men and the women
will love you, try it on.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.704
You do
realize those people

24:59.915 --> 25:01.201
are weird in there, don't you?

25:01.417 --> 25:02.703
Huh? No.

25:02.918 --> 25:04.079
No, what
do you mean no?

25:04.294 --> 25:06.001
You don't know that
they're not exactly normal?

25:06.213 --> 25:07.579
Um, no.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.710
I mean, do they have
you brainwashed or something?

25:10.134 --> 25:11.170
What's brainwashed?

25:11.385 --> 25:12.546
Like,
they think for you.

25:12.761 --> 25:13.877
You don't want to be like that,

25:14.096 --> 25:15.212
you want to be normal like me.

25:17.474 --> 25:18.464
Sorry, I sneezed.

25:18.684 --> 25:19.470
Are you okay?

25:20.352 --> 25:22.935
Yeah, it's been a
very hot day today.

25:23.147 --> 25:25.480
I bet, it's really
hotsy-totsy today.

25:25.691 --> 25:26.977
You don't have to
say stuff like that,

25:27.192 --> 25:28.649
it's kind of irritating,

25:28.861 --> 25:31.729
I mean, hotsy-totsy,
sharing is caring.

25:31.947 --> 25:32.983
Yummy in my tummy!

25:33.198 --> 25:34.188
See, there you go again.

25:34.408 --> 25:35.444
I mean, why do you
say stuff like that?

25:35.659 --> 25:36.900
It's very irritating.

25:37.119 --> 25:39.577
So in other words, it
rubs you in the wrong way?

25:39.788 --> 25:40.528
Yeah, that's right.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.122
So meaning, it's
not your cup of tea

25:43.333 --> 25:44.619
and it doesn't float your boat?

25:44.835 --> 25:46.451
See, you're doing it again.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.036
You don't want people to
think that you're abnormal

25:48.255 --> 25:49.917
or anything like that, right?

25:50.132 --> 25:53.500
Like those people
at that program.

25:53.719 --> 25:54.584
I don't know.

25:55.846 --> 25:56.802
No offense or anything,

25:57.014 --> 25:58.380
but I think you're above them.

25:58.599 --> 25:59.715
What's your problem anyway?

25:59.933 --> 26:02.721
I don't know what's
wrong with you.

26:02.936 --> 26:04.802
Well, I have autism.

26:05.022 --> 26:07.264
Is that it?

26:07.524 --> 26:10.358
Um, no, I also have an LD.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.435
What is that
like a venereal thing?

26:12.654 --> 26:14.020
No, it's a
learning disability.

26:14.239 --> 26:15.480
Oh, huh.

26:15.699 --> 26:19.409
Well, I guess
everybody's got problems.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.576
That's true, so
what's your problem, David?

26:25.084 --> 26:26.620
I don't know, I guess I got

26:26.835 --> 26:28.201
a little bit stressed
out this year,

26:28.420 --> 26:30.628
but I've been getting
better, you know?

26:42.476 --> 26:44.763
Why do you have to go
home so urgently, anyhow?

26:44.978 --> 26:47.311
How about if I take you
out instead tonight?

26:47.523 --> 26:49.480
What will I tell
my grandmother?

26:50.609 --> 26:53.522
Well, if not, then how
about tomorrow night?

26:53.737 --> 26:55.399
Tomorrow is Game Night.

26:55.614 --> 26:56.445
Thursday?

26:56.657 --> 26:58.523
Thursday, we're going on
a field trip to the zoo.

26:58.742 --> 26:59.903
How about Friday then?

27:00.119 --> 27:01.485
Friday is show tunes.

27:01.703 --> 27:02.489
Show tunes?

27:02.830 --> 27:06.289
Yeah, show tunes is
every single Friday.

27:06.500 --> 27:07.957
Every single Friday?

27:08.168 --> 27:10.581
I enjoy it
very much, show tunes.

27:10.796 --> 27:14.164
How about, just
miss one show tunes?

27:14.383 --> 27:15.169
Just for me?

27:25.477 --> 27:28.470
So I guess, I'll
see you this Friday?

27:30.816 --> 27:32.182
This is my bus.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.154
We're
gonna continue today

27:46.373 --> 27:48.456
working with our
theme of superheroes.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.327
Sound okay?

27:49.543 --> 27:50.624
Yes! Wonderful!

27:51.545 --> 27:53.332
So the question I
asked you guys last week,

27:53.547 --> 27:55.584
and I asked you guys to think
about it a little bit was:

27:55.799 --> 27:58.667
If you had a superpower,
what would it be?

27:58.886 --> 28:02.050
Uh, I guess it would be to,

28:02.264 --> 28:04.426
I guess it would be to,

28:07.686 --> 28:10.929
I guess it would
be to let the world

28:11.148 --> 28:13.390
know who I really am, you know?

28:13.609 --> 28:15.396
To let the world
know who you really are?

28:15.611 --> 28:19.025
But to really express
myself in a variety of ways.

28:19.239 --> 28:21.856
My superpower would be

28:22.117 --> 28:26.862
to get Matt Cone to
fall in love with me

28:27.122 --> 28:28.829
and to propose to me.

28:29.041 --> 28:33.081
Matt Cone is kissing
me, our shirts are off,

28:33.295 --> 28:36.379
we're lying down, his
stomach is touching mine.

28:37.966 --> 28:38.626
All right.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.670
Let's try to stay focused. Okay?

28:40.886 --> 28:42.843
On the count of three,
I'm gonna ask you guys

28:43.055 --> 28:44.921
to change the way you're
sitting in your chair,

28:45.140 --> 28:45.971
and I want you to think about

28:46.183 --> 28:49.051
how this superhero would sit.

28:49.603 --> 28:51.060
You ready?

28:51.271 --> 28:52.136
Okay, hold on I didn't
count to three yet.

28:52.356 --> 28:54.473
- Oh sorry.
- Okay, you ready?

28:54.691 --> 28:58.776
One, two, three!

28:59.696 --> 29:01.562
Ooh, careful.

29:01.782 --> 29:05.867
Look at all of these
amazing superheroes here.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.195
What incredible characters.

29:09.706 --> 29:10.412
David.

29:12.042 --> 29:15.126
If you had a superpower,
what would it be?

29:16.672 --> 29:18.334
I'd be invisible.

29:21.426 --> 29:22.166
Why?

29:24.471 --> 29:26.713
So I can go into the
ladies' locker room.

29:31.395 --> 29:34.058
To do this stunt,
takes a lot of confidence.

29:34.648 --> 29:37.356
You all should
be confident.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.487
Give him a hand!

29:48.578 --> 29:50.410
So, a guy walks
into a sex shop

29:50.622 --> 29:53.615
and says, "I want
an inflatable doll."

29:55.294 --> 29:56.455
What's an inflatable?

29:56.670 --> 29:58.502
You know, those sex dolls,

29:58.714 --> 30:00.922
you have sex with
those inflatable dolls

30:01.133 --> 30:03.216
that you see at the Porno Stop.

30:03.427 --> 30:07.216
But so he says, "do
you want a male doll

30:07.472 --> 30:09.008
"or a female doll
to do it with?"

30:09.224 --> 30:12.137
"I want a female doll to do
with, what do you think I'm gay

30:12.352 --> 30:14.093
"and I want to do it
with a male doll?"

30:14.313 --> 30:17.021
"Okay, do you want a black
doll or a white doll?"

30:17.232 --> 30:20.396
"I don't know, I'm not
sure, I guess a white doll?"

30:20.610 --> 30:22.897
That's so racist
and offensive.

30:23.113 --> 30:26.572
Well it gets even more
racist and offensive!

30:26.783 --> 30:28.445
"Do you want a Jewish
inflatable doll,

30:28.660 --> 30:31.403
"a Christian inflatable doll
or a Muslim inflatable doll?"

30:31.621 --> 30:32.577
He goes, "Why do
you ask me that?"

30:33.457 --> 30:36.996
"Because the Muslims,
they blow themselves up!"

30:37.210 --> 30:37.996
Allah!

30:41.423 --> 30:42.664
You don't get it?

30:42.883 --> 30:46.376
No I don't, I find it really
offensive, and so confusing.

30:46.595 --> 30:48.837
So, you know that
girl that said,

30:49.056 --> 30:50.422
"I'm not working during the week

30:50.640 --> 30:52.848
"because I have to go
do camp in Cranford?"

30:53.060 --> 30:54.267
- Right.
- So I go, "Oh well,

30:54.478 --> 30:55.594
"I'm Jewish, I don't
like to do camp."

30:55.812 --> 30:57.394
Hold on, what camp is this?

30:57.606 --> 30:59.472
I don't know, I think
it's a concentration.

31:01.234 --> 31:02.941
I'm just kidding!

31:03.153 --> 31:04.485
That's not funny!

31:05.364 --> 31:07.572
I need to concentrate.

31:07.783 --> 31:08.864
Right.

31:09.076 --> 31:10.692
So what camp is this?

31:10.911 --> 31:12.118
Um, I'm not sure.

31:12.329 --> 31:13.115
Okay.

31:14.122 --> 31:16.239
But, I go, "I don't like to go

31:16.458 --> 31:18.916
to no camps, I'm Jewish!"

31:19.127 --> 31:21.460
Well, I'm, you know
what David, I'm Jewish,

31:21.671 --> 31:22.502
but I've been to sleep-away camp

31:22.714 --> 31:23.921
and I've performed in a lot of

31:24.132 --> 31:25.714
musical theater
productions and plays.

31:25.926 --> 31:28.418
Oh, it was a stupid
joke I said, I'm sorry...

31:28.637 --> 31:30.629
Can you give me
a time to ask you, maybe,

31:30.847 --> 31:31.712
what the joke means?

31:31.932 --> 31:32.843
I'll explain the joke,

31:33.058 --> 31:34.139
I mean, I'll explain the joke.

31:34.351 --> 31:35.637
Because words can

31:35.852 --> 31:37.468
have multiple meanings.
- Because, it's like,

31:37.687 --> 31:39.349
yeah, there were
multiple meanings.

31:39.564 --> 31:40.395
Just like with...

31:40.607 --> 31:41.472
Maybe when there's a pause

31:41.691 --> 31:43.148
I can ask you for
clarification...

31:43.360 --> 31:44.191
- Words...
- Wait, don't interrupt me,

31:44.403 --> 31:45.439
I can ask you for clarification.

31:45.654 --> 31:46.394
I'm sorry, I'm
getting nervous,

31:46.863 --> 31:49.150
I didn't mean to interrupt.
- Maybe when there's a pause

31:49.366 --> 31:50.982
to ask you, so I
know what it means.

31:51.201 --> 31:52.362
I need specifics.

31:52.577 --> 31:53.658
I only said
it to make you laugh,

31:53.870 --> 31:54.951
not to make you argue with me.

31:55.163 --> 31:56.904
It sounds like Who's on First.

31:57.207 --> 31:59.199
I don't want to
hear Who's on First, I just,

31:59.418 --> 32:01.626
all I care about is
understanding your jokes.

32:01.837 --> 32:03.954
Sarah, I
made a boo-boo, okay?

32:04.172 --> 32:06.334
It's not you, it's me.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.258
I didn't mean to annoy
you just now, okay?

32:32.451 --> 32:34.408
How ya doing,
chicken and rice.

32:34.619 --> 32:36.155
David.

32:36.371 --> 32:38.408
I have an opportunity
that I think

32:38.623 --> 32:40.956
you'll appreciate as a gay man.

32:42.085 --> 32:43.246
What?

32:43.462 --> 32:44.623
Uh, lamb gyro please?

32:44.838 --> 32:47.046
Dude, I'm not gay.

32:48.258 --> 32:49.089
What?

32:49.551 --> 32:51.508
- Sorry, I'm not gay.
- Thank you.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.552
But you have such
gay mannerisms.

32:53.763 --> 32:54.970
You're so artsy.

32:55.932 --> 32:59.221
You're so suave and you seem
to flirt with all the guys.

33:00.520 --> 33:02.887
How would you and
Matt like to come

33:03.106 --> 33:06.895
to our exclusive club
of show tunes on Friday?

33:07.110 --> 33:08.601
I can't this
Friday, I have plans.

33:08.820 --> 33:09.810
Cancel them.

33:11.281 --> 33:14.240
Nah, I'm supposed
to see Sarah that day.

33:14.451 --> 33:17.194
Sarah is gonna
be at show tunes.

33:17.412 --> 33:18.448
She can't get
out of this Friday?

33:18.663 --> 33:20.154
She can't, ever!

33:20.373 --> 33:22.456
She is the star,
she is the diva,

33:22.667 --> 33:25.375
she is the songbird,
she provides the music.

33:25.587 --> 33:28.204
Without her,
there'd be no music.

33:28.423 --> 33:29.379
Well, I gotta
see Sarah that day,

33:29.591 --> 33:31.833
I mean, we have plans, you know?

33:32.052 --> 33:34.294
I mean, to go out on a date.

33:34.513 --> 33:35.924
She's my girlfriend.

33:36.139 --> 33:36.925
What?

33:37.265 --> 33:38.472
Yeah, she's my girlfriend.

33:38.683 --> 33:39.924
Oh my god!

33:40.727 --> 33:42.389
You know what then, nevermind.

33:42.604 --> 33:44.186
Don't come to show
tunes, it's okay,

33:44.397 --> 33:45.308
forget I ever said anything.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.015
Don't come to show tunes.

33:47.234 --> 33:48.566
Wait wait, what the hell,

33:48.777 --> 33:50.564
you just offered me and
then you take it away?

33:50.779 --> 33:51.610
No, it's okay, I
changed my mind...

33:51.905 --> 33:53.066
I got to see Sarah that day!

33:53.406 --> 33:54.567
You can see Sarah another day.

33:54.783 --> 33:57.446
Please don't come to show tunes.

33:58.620 --> 33:59.610
Why not?

34:00.580 --> 34:01.536
Why not?

34:06.836 --> 34:08.452
How much?

34:09.589 --> 34:10.920
$5.

34:11.132 --> 34:14.216
There you
go, keep the change.

34:14.427 --> 34:16.589
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

34:29.568 --> 34:33.107
Your turn, Zach, if
that's your real name.

34:33.321 --> 34:36.735
Uh, how 'bout
something from Les Mis.

34:36.949 --> 34:37.940
Could we please
do something else?

34:38.159 --> 34:39.570
We hear it all the
time from Sarah.

34:39.786 --> 34:41.072
How about
a song from Cats?

34:41.288 --> 34:42.199
Which version?

34:42.414 --> 34:43.449
Can it be the same one?

34:43.665 --> 34:44.655
I prefer it wasn't,

34:44.873 --> 34:47.116
we like some variety
in this thing.

34:47.335 --> 34:49.292
Zach, could you
pick something else?

34:49.504 --> 34:51.370
- No.
- It's not up to him, Sammy.

34:51.590 --> 34:54.674
All right, your
turn, hippy guy.

34:54.884 --> 34:58.503
My name is Dylan, don't
call me that ever again.

34:58.722 --> 35:00.463
What's your pick.

35:00.682 --> 35:01.718
The Acid Queen.

35:01.933 --> 35:05.222
Great song,
but not a show tune.

35:17.324 --> 35:20.442
How about, Paradox,

35:20.660 --> 35:21.992
or When You Had Left
Your Pirate Fold,

35:22.203 --> 35:23.444
from Pirates of Penzance?

35:23.663 --> 35:25.120
You always pick that one,

35:25.332 --> 35:29.997
but the game requires
me to indulge you.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.009
David?

35:46.227 --> 35:47.138
Hey everybody.

35:47.354 --> 35:49.391
What are you doing here?

35:50.565 --> 35:52.352
I told you not to come.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.603
Gotta
give this to you.

35:59.282 --> 36:01.365
Wow, you look great!

36:01.576 --> 36:03.317
I mean, you look
great in red too.

36:03.536 --> 36:07.496
I love the red dress
by the way, you know.

36:07.707 --> 36:10.074
I was figuring, maybe you
wanna get together later,

36:10.293 --> 36:11.750
after this thing, you know?

36:11.961 --> 36:13.748
Go out somewhere to eat?

36:17.842 --> 36:20.459
Why aren't you happy to see me?

36:23.390 --> 36:26.428
David, I know how smokin'
hot and sexy you are,

36:26.643 --> 36:28.225
but this is not the right time

36:28.436 --> 36:30.519
and the place to be
having this conversation.

36:30.730 --> 36:33.768
We're not gonna discuss
it here any further.

36:38.279 --> 36:41.943
So, what exactly is
it that you do, David?

36:42.158 --> 36:43.899
I'm a filmmaker.

36:44.119 --> 36:45.200
Uh-huh?

36:45.412 --> 36:46.994
I have a
project in the works.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.572
Let me guess, you...

36:49.791 --> 36:51.783
still live with your parents.

36:52.001 --> 36:54.084
Never earned a
nickel in your life,

36:54.295 --> 36:55.877
and never actually make films,

36:56.089 --> 36:58.172
just talk about making them.

36:58.383 --> 37:01.251
Am I on point here, so far?

37:01.469 --> 37:03.381
I'm a legit filmmaker.

37:03.596 --> 37:05.383
I have a film, which
is in consideration

37:05.598 --> 37:07.464
of the Palm Beach
International Film Festival.

37:07.684 --> 37:09.550
Here, take a look at this.

37:09.769 --> 37:10.600
My movie.

37:26.494 --> 37:29.487
Please take that
thing out of my face,

37:29.706 --> 37:31.117
a bunch of random home movies

37:31.332 --> 37:34.370
strung together in
no aesthetic order.

37:34.586 --> 37:38.421
So, Sarah, my darling,
it is your turn.

37:38.631 --> 37:40.543
Why don't
you ever let me sing?

37:40.759 --> 37:44.719
As my girlfriend, Sarah
has special privileges.

37:47.932 --> 37:50.595
Now sing my beautiful songbird!

38:00.403 --> 38:03.111
Magnificent, brava!

38:03.323 --> 38:05.690
Sarah and Will are a couple?

38:05.909 --> 38:07.241
Let me explain,

38:09.078 --> 38:16.246
Sarah is basically a
player or a man-izer.

38:16.461 --> 38:17.668
Whoa.

38:17.879 --> 38:19.290
This is part of her nature.

38:19.506 --> 38:20.963
She said she really likes me,

38:21.174 --> 38:22.756
that I'm the cat's meow.

38:22.967 --> 38:26.586
She also describes the
holocaust as a bummer.

38:26.805 --> 38:29.138
Can you understand
this about her?

38:29.349 --> 38:30.009
Yeah.

38:30.642 --> 38:33.931
Don't expect anything
other than dates and sex.

38:37.899 --> 38:39.856
Can we play the title
song of Anything Goes?

39:01.422 --> 39:02.629
Help a brother out man?

39:02.841 --> 39:04.753
Get that fuckin'
thing out of my face,

39:04.968 --> 39:06.550
it's not my fault you
fucked your life up,

39:06.761 --> 39:08.673
you fuckin' asshole!

39:08.888 --> 39:10.925
Fuck you, you bum!

39:11.140 --> 39:12.472
Fuck you!

39:12.684 --> 39:14.391
Chill out, dude.

39:14.602 --> 39:16.594
Shut the fuck up!

39:17.647 --> 39:20.060
Okay, Sarah, Zach?

39:20.275 --> 39:22.437
Now, we did scene three before,

39:22.652 --> 39:24.939
now we're gonna try
it without scripts.

39:25.154 --> 39:27.988
That being said,
Zach, same thing.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.065
Butt-naked would be best.

39:32.161 --> 39:32.867
All my
clothes are staying on.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.365
Then, that is fine.

39:34.581 --> 39:35.492
To him directly?

39:35.707 --> 39:36.367
Yes.

39:36.583 --> 39:37.414
Oh, Travis.

39:37.625 --> 39:39.287
I'm so impressed you came to me.

39:39.502 --> 39:40.333
Sarah?

39:40.545 --> 39:41.786
- What?
- You don't know his name.

39:42.005 --> 39:43.416
No, just say
it without the name?

39:43.631 --> 39:44.587
Say it without the name.

39:45.925 --> 39:47.791
Oh my God, I'm so
impressed you came to me.

39:48.011 --> 39:50.048
The joy of my life!

39:50.263 --> 39:51.003
It makes me, I'm so thrilled!

39:51.222 --> 39:52.008
Sarah.

39:52.932 --> 39:53.638
- What?
- Do you tell him

39:53.850 --> 39:54.510
how you feel, right away?

39:54.726 --> 39:55.557
No.

39:59.689 --> 40:01.806
Why you didn't
tell me you had a boyfriend?

40:02.025 --> 40:02.856
What do you mean?

40:03.067 --> 40:04.148
Exactly what I meant.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.977
Why you didn't tell me
you had a boyfriend?

40:08.990 --> 40:10.777
Well, I don't
know how you felt

40:10.992 --> 40:12.358
about open relationships...

40:12.577 --> 40:14.569
Open relationships?

40:14.787 --> 40:15.903
This is what you call this?

40:16.122 --> 40:18.535
David,
I still need to,

40:18.750 --> 40:21.914
I need to still properly
smooth you out here.

40:22.128 --> 40:24.871
I mean, what you
don't understand is,

40:25.089 --> 40:27.752
there's so much fish
out there in the sea.

40:27.967 --> 40:30.254
And you let all
these fish, touch you?

40:30.470 --> 40:31.881
No, it's just,

40:32.096 --> 40:33.962
all these men who
are on top of me,

40:34.182 --> 40:36.549
all over me.
- Oh my god...

40:36.768 --> 40:38.555
or on my lap.

40:38.770 --> 40:39.851
What?

40:40.772 --> 40:43.185
Am I hearing right, they sit
on your lap and all that?

40:43.399 --> 40:44.560
My god.

40:46.152 --> 40:48.360
Okay, I'm going to use a really,
really ugly word right now.

40:48.571 --> 40:49.402
I'm not ugly.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.105
I didn't say you were ugly.

40:51.324 --> 40:53.691
I said I'm using an ugly word.

40:53.910 --> 40:57.153
Does the word promiscuous
mean anything to you?

40:57.372 --> 40:58.613
No.

40:58.831 --> 41:02.370
It means that these
men, do not respect you.

41:02.585 --> 41:06.329
That they just want
you for one thing.

41:06.547 --> 41:09.381
Right in the
spur of the moment,

41:09.592 --> 41:11.424
I feel as though you're
putting a lot of social

41:11.636 --> 41:13.719
and emotional pressure
right now to me.

41:13.930 --> 41:16.217
When was the last
time Will actually

41:16.432 --> 41:19.220
included you in a
conversation, huh?

41:22.647 --> 41:23.603
See?

41:23.815 --> 41:24.896
I'm not pressuring you.

41:25.108 --> 41:26.394
You do what you want to.

41:26.609 --> 41:29.898
I'm not gonna force you
to be my girlfriend.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.153
Whatever.

41:50.216 --> 41:53.380
Sarah and David, you
had some homework, right?

41:53.594 --> 41:55.551
You went to the Brooklyn Bridge?

41:55.763 --> 41:56.753
How was it?

41:58.683 --> 42:00.265
It's kind of irritating.

42:00.476 --> 42:03.014
Okay,
irritating, how?

42:04.480 --> 42:05.721
Sarah, what about you?

42:05.940 --> 42:08.523
What did you think of
the Brooklyn Bridge?

42:08.735 --> 42:12.274
Well, to be very
honest with you, Dorsey,

42:12.822 --> 42:15.860
even though David found
it really irritating

42:16.075 --> 42:20.069
to focus on the positive,
I had a wonderful time.

42:20.288 --> 42:22.245
Terrific memories there.

42:22.457 --> 42:24.164
Can anybody
else relate to that?

42:24.375 --> 42:27.459
Yeah, I
don't envy anybody...

42:55.198 --> 42:57.815
Are you
getting in, Mr. Cohen?

43:14.383 --> 43:16.545
What about your friends?

43:31.776 --> 43:33.688
One, two... gah!

43:35.988 --> 43:37.104
Be angry!

43:37.448 --> 43:39.485
Wooo!

43:39.700 --> 43:40.565
Wow.

43:41.536 --> 43:42.868
One more for good luck!

43:43.079 --> 43:45.492
You wanna kiss your boyfriend.

43:46.457 --> 43:48.119
What
about you, girl?

43:48.334 --> 43:49.666
I don't know how.

43:50.044 --> 43:51.376
Here,
use this, use this.

43:51.587 --> 43:53.123
I just felt like watching.

43:53.339 --> 43:55.956
I have very severe diet
restrictions to gluten,

43:56.175 --> 43:58.258
I wanna make sure
there's no gluten.

43:58.469 --> 43:59.755
I just want to make
it absolutely very,

43:59.971 --> 44:01.087
very crystal clear.

44:01.305 --> 44:03.217
And if it has no gluten,

44:03.432 --> 44:04.513
I would really love
the lobster salad.

44:04.725 --> 44:06.136
Does mayonnaise
have gluten in it?

44:06.352 --> 44:07.718
No, all right.

44:07.937 --> 44:08.802
Okay, yeah.

44:09.438 --> 44:11.600
Look at this, this is fun.

44:13.609 --> 44:15.020
It doesn't have to necessarily

44:15.236 --> 44:17.148
be on the beach David, you know?

44:17.363 --> 44:19.525
Well this is what
the beach is about.

44:19.740 --> 44:22.232
David, I just really don't
like the sand on my feet.

44:22.451 --> 44:24.818
Come on, I just
wanna hold your hand.

44:25.037 --> 44:26.244
Can't we do something else?

44:26.455 --> 44:28.242
Like mix and match and
explore a variety...

44:28.457 --> 44:29.368
What you want to do Sarah?

44:29.584 --> 44:31.621
Okay, what do you
want to do, okay?

44:31.836 --> 44:34.374
- What I want to do David...
- We're in Coney Island here.

44:34.589 --> 44:35.670
There's like a million
things to do here,

44:35.882 --> 44:36.918
what do you want to do?

44:37.133 --> 44:38.340
Oh my god.
- Oh, look, look!...

44:39.177 --> 44:40.042
David, look!

44:40.261 --> 44:41.752
Look at this, I love,
this looks so exciting,

44:41.971 --> 44:43.212
look at the one
right here, look!

44:44.640 --> 44:46.131
David,
sweetheart, this looks

44:46.350 --> 44:47.431
so exciting and tantalizing.

44:49.103 --> 44:50.435
It looks like the
strings are going to break,

44:50.646 --> 44:51.557
I don't want you to get hurt.

44:52.231 --> 44:53.847
We won't get hurt,
you'll protect me.

44:54.066 --> 44:55.773
I want to go on them with you.

44:58.487 --> 45:00.695
I just figured,
you'd like the teacups,

45:00.907 --> 45:03.365
the horsey rides, the boats.

45:03.576 --> 45:05.943
Perfect for a lady
like you, you know?

45:06.162 --> 45:07.243
I don't want to go
on the baby rides,

45:07.455 --> 45:08.741
I've aged out of those stages.

45:08.956 --> 45:10.492
Do you want
to go on the sling ride?

45:10.708 --> 45:11.539
Where's the sling ride?

45:11.751 --> 45:13.287
Look at that, up in the air.

45:13.502 --> 45:15.414
The boat rides, are
still not appropriate for my,

45:15.630 --> 45:17.337
the boat rides are
still very babyish.

45:17.548 --> 45:19.460
We can always go
on the horsey ride, you know,

45:19.675 --> 45:20.506
like the merry-go-round?

45:20.718 --> 45:22.755
Everybody goes on
the merry-go-round.

45:23.012 --> 45:23.968
Everyone of all ages.

45:24.180 --> 45:25.216
- Okay.
- It's not just for babies.

45:25.640 --> 45:28.053
Okay, I trust you on
that, we'll do that.

45:45.451 --> 45:46.487
What's wrong?

45:46.702 --> 45:48.534
Don't you want a horse?

45:48.746 --> 45:50.829
No, horses are not for men.

46:13.521 --> 46:15.262
Woohoo!

46:16.524 --> 46:17.765
Woohoo!

46:17.984 --> 46:19.065
Woo!

46:21.237 --> 46:24.526
I'm having a
blast, David, woo!

46:26.659 --> 46:27.900
Woo!

46:30.496 --> 46:31.202
Woohoo!

46:35.293 --> 46:37.535
Sorry, it's my allergies.

46:49.473 --> 46:51.430
It's okay, it's okay!

47:00.192 --> 47:03.856
Oh, I'm out of control,
get off the ride!

47:11.162 --> 47:12.278
Stop the ride!

47:13.748 --> 47:14.909
Stop the ride!

47:55.664 --> 47:58.156
About that thing,
the horsey ride,

47:58.376 --> 47:59.708
I just got real sick that's all,

47:59.919 --> 48:02.036
but I'm okay now, you know?

48:03.255 --> 48:06.999
I mean, I'm not contagious
or anything like...

48:09.762 --> 48:11.344
Sarah, look at me.

48:11.555 --> 48:12.466
I'm okay.

48:15.684 --> 48:19.018
I mean, I've really
been getting better.

49:12.158 --> 49:14.650
Well, I always say,
you can't go wrong

49:14.869 --> 49:16.576
with a little Gilbert
and Sullivan...

49:16.787 --> 49:17.823
Gilbert and Sullivan?

49:18.038 --> 49:18.903
For this?

49:19.832 --> 49:22.199
How 'bout some
Justin Timberlake.

49:22.418 --> 49:23.124
Hey, Will.

49:23.586 --> 49:25.168
Let's do Mirrors
and Cry Me A River,

49:25.463 --> 49:27.250
they're both on your Best List.

49:31.010 --> 49:31.966
I'm excited to see

49:32.178 --> 49:35.091
what you present
in the showcase.

49:35.306 --> 49:38.765
Oh really, I thought
you were just passing through.

49:58.662 --> 50:00.654
Are you a fairy princess?

50:03.042 --> 50:07.207
I really love your
outfit, it's so beautiful!

50:07.421 --> 50:10.380
I love green, it's
my favorite color!

50:30.402 --> 50:32.268
Hey, thank you!

50:32.488 --> 50:33.444
God bless you!

50:34.657 --> 50:35.773
Here we
are, my cousin's play.

50:35.991 --> 50:37.983
You're just gonna love it.

51:02.726 --> 51:04.467
Hey Matt, it's David.

51:04.687 --> 51:08.146
We just saw your show,
we're still at the theater,

51:08.357 --> 51:09.564
so I don't know what to do.

51:09.900 --> 51:11.766
You want to meet us
at the restaurant?

51:11.986 --> 51:13.397
Is there anything I
can help you with though?

51:13.612 --> 51:14.693
No, I don't really
need anything.

51:14.905 --> 51:16.316
I wanna know what
your hobbies are,

51:16.532 --> 51:18.194
what are you passionate about?

51:19.243 --> 51:21.360
I don't have hobbies.

51:21.579 --> 51:22.410
I just work.

51:23.581 --> 51:25.038
Oh, what are you
so passionate about

51:25.249 --> 51:26.080
working in the theater?

51:26.292 --> 51:28.909
What do you love
about it so much?

51:29.128 --> 51:30.369
Nothing.

51:30.588 --> 51:33.456
I don't love anything about it.

51:33.674 --> 51:36.633
Please give me a call, okay?

51:36.844 --> 51:37.630
Hi.

51:37.845 --> 51:39.677
- Hey.
- We're not exactly

51:39.888 --> 51:42.175
asking for autographs,
have you seen Matt Cone?

51:42.391 --> 51:44.633
I just work the door,
I'm just security.

51:44.852 --> 51:47.344
If I show my ticket
stubs, can I go in?

51:47.563 --> 51:48.303
I really got to see him.

51:48.522 --> 51:49.729
You can't go in here.

51:49.940 --> 51:53.479
Well, they do come out
here, the actor's right?

51:53.694 --> 51:54.855
I'm not asking for any trouble,

51:55.070 --> 51:57.107
I'm not a bad person
or anything, I just...

51:57.323 --> 51:58.530
You're not
getting any trouble.

51:58.741 --> 52:01.233
There's no trouble, you
just can't go in this door.

52:01.452 --> 52:02.568
He's my cousin, you know?

52:02.786 --> 52:04.698
I don't care who
your cousin is,

52:04.913 --> 52:07.280
or your brother, your
uncle, your grandmother,

52:07.499 --> 52:08.660
I don't care...

52:08.917 --> 52:10.374
I feel like you're angry
at the world, ya know.

52:10.586 --> 52:12.498
You should just
lighten up, ya know?

52:12.713 --> 52:14.625
I mean, I'll tell you a joke,

52:14.840 --> 52:17.457
Shia LaBeouf was in the
car with Lindsay Lohan.

52:17.676 --> 52:20.134
Do you know who was driving?

52:20.346 --> 52:21.712
The cops!

52:23.265 --> 52:24.096
You trying to get hurt?

52:24.308 --> 52:26.425
You wanna get hurt tonight?

52:28.729 --> 52:31.517
Being up so
late, it's gorgeous.

52:31.732 --> 52:36.227
Well hurry up,
the light, the light.

52:36.445 --> 52:38.687
David, it's
so deserted here,

52:38.906 --> 52:41.068
like there's no one,
there's no souls,

52:41.283 --> 52:43.445
like it's practically not even...

52:43.661 --> 52:45.994
Watch out for those bikers!

52:50.668 --> 52:52.250
Isn't this place great?

52:52.461 --> 52:53.292
Oh my god.

52:53.504 --> 52:55.211
You know you're
at a good restaurant

52:55.422 --> 52:56.754
when the ambiance is beautiful.

52:56.965 --> 52:58.456
So, take a look at the menu.

53:02.137 --> 53:04.379
David, but the language
is so confusing, I mean...

53:04.598 --> 53:07.341
That's because it's
Italian, it's another country.

53:07.559 --> 53:08.925
David, I don't
speak any Italian,

53:09.144 --> 53:10.760
it's very confusing.
- I don't either.

53:10.979 --> 53:12.515
Just order anything
that sounds pretty.

53:12.731 --> 53:16.975
Under antipasti,
there's esparigo di campo,

53:17.194 --> 53:21.939
esparigo oliva oil,
foggi montinada.

53:22.616 --> 53:24.949
David, that's so confusing

53:25.160 --> 53:27.402
that I have no idea
what that means.

53:27.621 --> 53:29.453
That's how Italian
works, you know?

53:29.665 --> 53:30.451
Good evening.

53:30.791 --> 53:32.453
Hi my name is Kevin, I'll
be taking care of you.

53:32.668 --> 53:33.374
- Hey Kevin.
- Good evening Kevin.

53:33.585 --> 53:34.291
What's up Kevin?

53:34.503 --> 53:35.914
Something for the
lovely lady and gentleman?

53:36.171 --> 53:36.877
Well, I just want you to know,

53:37.089 --> 53:37.954
I'm expecting two more people.

53:38.674 --> 53:41.007
Oh great, well we do
have some specials tonight:

53:41.218 --> 53:44.211
Mozzarella con Funghi,
Scallopine Tutta Terra,

53:44.430 --> 53:47.923
Farfalle con Pollo,
Carciofi, Marsala,

53:48.142 --> 53:50.259
Salmone, that's with the
little white wine sauce.

53:50.477 --> 53:53.185
It sounds so
beautiful and romantic.

53:53.397 --> 53:54.808
See, it sounds
like music, Sarah.

53:55.023 --> 53:56.184
It sounds great,
here why don't you

53:56.400 --> 53:57.766
order whatever you want, okay?

53:57.985 --> 53:59.271
Excuse me for a minute.

53:59.570 --> 54:02.233
Okeydokey artichokey,
oh my goodness.

54:02.448 --> 54:03.780
I mean, we're
holding the table for you,

54:03.991 --> 54:06.233
but you want to meet for
drinks after or something?

54:06.452 --> 54:07.909
Ah, sorry bud.

54:08.120 --> 54:09.452
This cast party's
not letting out,

54:09.663 --> 54:11.325
but it'll be just
you and me next time.

54:11.540 --> 54:13.076
I promise.
- Yeah, yeah and Sarah.

54:13.292 --> 54:15.454
You gotta meet this
girl, she's beautiful,

54:15.669 --> 54:18.002
classy and she's
crazy about me, Matt.

54:18.213 --> 54:20.546
All right buddy,
I can't wait to meet her.

54:20.758 --> 54:23.671
Yeah, we'll do a double date.

54:23.886 --> 54:26.378
Wow, this is a lot of food.

54:26.597 --> 54:29.055
I'm glad you're getting
comfortable here.

54:29.266 --> 54:31.178
How do you like it?
- This is to die from.

54:31.393 --> 54:34.227
Yeah,
it's good, isn't it?

54:35.647 --> 54:36.353
Mm!

54:42.112 --> 54:43.899
And here we are...

54:44.114 --> 54:44.729
Wow.

54:45.324 --> 54:47.566
Would you
like anything else?

54:47.785 --> 54:51.495
No, I'll just
have the check, here.

54:51.705 --> 54:53.412
Great.

54:53.624 --> 54:54.614
I've never seen
you so happy before,

54:54.833 --> 54:57.291
aren't you glad you came here?

55:03.091 --> 55:05.549
This is a $900 bill.

55:05.761 --> 55:08.469
What were you doing
there, traveling Europe?

55:08.680 --> 55:10.387
I met a girl.

55:10.599 --> 55:13.091
David, come on, one
of the internet women,

55:13.310 --> 55:14.391
your imaginary girlfriends?

55:14.603 --> 55:16.185
No, this girl's real.

55:16.396 --> 55:18.183
Sure she is.

55:21.610 --> 55:23.522
She wants to marry me.

55:24.446 --> 55:25.778
What?

55:25.989 --> 55:27.776
David, that is not funny.

55:27.991 --> 55:29.527
Where's she from?

55:32.579 --> 55:33.660
From that group?

55:36.583 --> 55:39.075
This is a gold-digger.

55:39.294 --> 55:41.536
From now on, you go to your
classes, you come home.

55:41.755 --> 55:43.417
Look I'll pay you back.

55:43.632 --> 55:45.874
You couldn't pay me
back for a Lifesaver.

55:48.178 --> 55:49.385
It's not the money.

55:49.596 --> 55:52.179
It's where will you
be when we're gone?

55:52.391 --> 55:56.385
Who's going to take care of
you when Dad and I are gone?

56:20.127 --> 56:20.867
Hi.

56:57.122 --> 56:58.909
Sarah.

56:59.124 --> 57:00.331
Hi grandma.

57:00.542 --> 57:01.623
Hi, who's this?

57:01.835 --> 57:04.999
This is my
boyfriend, David Cohen.

57:05.213 --> 57:06.920
- Hi David.
- Hi.

57:07.132 --> 57:09.840
Would you like a tequila?

57:10.052 --> 57:13.921
Uh, no thanks, I'm not
thirsty but thank you.

57:14.139 --> 57:16.176
Oh, you're welcome.

57:16.391 --> 57:18.178
Okay, excuse me,

57:18.393 --> 57:19.600
I'm going in.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

57:19.811 --> 57:21.723
Yeah,
it's all right.

57:23.065 --> 57:24.476
She's my Grandma.

57:25.567 --> 57:26.853
She's an alcoholic.

57:27.069 --> 57:27.684
Oh.

57:42.292 --> 57:43.624
There's me
at my bar mitzvah.

57:43.835 --> 57:44.825
Aww.

57:46.171 --> 57:48.538
Yeah, I was
a cute kid back then.

57:55.931 --> 57:58.218
That's my prom date.

57:58.433 --> 58:01.301
I didn't even get to kiss her.

58:01.520 --> 58:02.681
That's too bad.

58:02.896 --> 58:04.979
Well, that's high school.

58:56.533 --> 58:58.525
Say hi to
the camera, David.

59:20.140 --> 59:21.631
So what do you think, huh?

59:21.850 --> 59:22.590
Isn't it great?

59:23.226 --> 59:26.765
I mean, that's my whole
autobiography, you know?

59:27.689 --> 59:30.397
Overall, I really,
really loved it.

59:30.609 --> 59:31.975
It's a powerful film.

59:32.194 --> 59:35.813
You have to admit, it is very
creative, don't you think?

59:36.031 --> 59:37.943
Yeah, it's really...

59:38.325 --> 59:39.782
to be very honest with you,

59:40.035 --> 59:43.574
I mean, it's very powerful
and very creative.

59:43.830 --> 59:46.117
I really loved it very
very much overall,

59:46.333 --> 59:47.039
except for...
- That's right,

59:47.250 --> 59:49.207
it's a work of art.

59:49.419 --> 59:51.376
Yeah, that's what I
really loved about it,

59:51.588 --> 59:54.376
for everything
except for the ending

59:54.591 --> 59:56.378
which was really,
really confusing.

59:56.593 --> 59:58.550
But that's the point.

59:58.762 --> 01:00:03.507
Nobody says, when I grow up,
I choose to be that, you know?

01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:06.763
And sometimes, changes
happen for the worst

01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:09.265
and people just have a
sad ending after that,

01:00:09.481 --> 01:00:11.017
and that's realistic.

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:15.393
Like that, you know
those tics and all that.

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:17.069
Those noises that I make?

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.146
I'm perfectly aware of that,

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:21.483
but David, let me give you
also positive critiques,

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:23.693
what I did really, really
love, your childhood memories,

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:26.825
your bar mitzvah
and your graduation,

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.373
they were so rewarding
and so special.

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:31.450
You know my cousin, Matt Cone?

01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:32.706
Yeah.

01:00:32.921 --> 01:00:34.128
You know how
Sammy always says,

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:36.456
oh Matt Cone this, Matt
Cone that, I want Matt Cone.

01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:37.540
You know why?

01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:39.584
He's a very, very
important person.

01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:41.135
He's an actor and all that.

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:43.008
A real big-time celebrity.

01:00:43.223 --> 01:00:44.555
- Mm-hmm.
- He's going to like

01:00:44.766 --> 01:00:46.723
put this in a film festival.

01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:48.551
Palm Beach International
Film Festival.

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:50.432
He's gonna open the door for me,

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:54.561
and I'm gonna catch my
big break in Hollywood.

01:00:54.776 --> 01:00:55.766
You know?
- Cool.

01:00:57.988 --> 01:00:59.775
Sarah, can I
ask you something?

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:01.106
Yes David, sure.

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:04.988
I mean, I know that,
I seem like a big shot

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:08.446
driving around town
with my limo driver,

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:11.954
and taking you to all these
nice fancy restaurants.

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:13.580
It never occurred to you,

01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:18.881
oh this kid's just a
total bum with no future,

01:01:19.134 --> 01:01:20.375
just a complete bum.

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:22.426
You don't think
I'm a bum, do you?

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:25.300
Absolutely not, David.

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:30.306
I think you're really,
really bright, very smart,

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:36.016
really, really a glorious
hunky, sensational

01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:41.146
and just so sexy and
attractive-looking.

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:47.736
To a point that it's really
getting me in a very horny

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:50.321
and sexually-arousing
mood right now.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:54.284
Wow, oh my god, you
have your hand on my leg.

01:02:27.619 --> 01:02:30.327
That feels so
sexually arousing.

01:02:34.709 --> 01:02:35.415
Oh, god.

01:03:27.554 --> 01:03:28.385
Hi!

01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:32.431
Go Josh, go Josh, go
Josh, go Josh, go Josh.

01:03:33.685 --> 01:03:35.893
Go Sarah, go Sarah, go Sarah.

01:03:46.614 --> 01:03:48.355
It's so easy,
it's a piece of cake.

01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:50.441
I'll teach you, David.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:51.821
I don't like to
dance, come on.

01:03:52.037 --> 01:03:53.573
But I'll teach
you, it's a piece of cake.

01:03:53.788 --> 01:03:55.029
Come to the dance floor.

01:04:46.633 --> 01:04:51.594
I would like to make a
toast to Sarah and David.

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:54.513
As somebody who
has dated many men,

01:04:55.642 --> 01:05:00.512
I never thought you would find
love like you did with David.

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:05.065
You two are really going
to make it as a couple!

01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:06.483
I know it.

01:05:06.694 --> 01:05:09.311
So here's to you,
to Sarah and David!

01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:12.740
To Sarah and David!

01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:16.865
It's getting a little
sappy for my taste here.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.742
When we say I love you,

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:24.581
we're really trying to
say to the other person,

01:05:24.796 --> 01:05:28.540
I like you enough not to
wanna rip your face off

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:32.251
and feed it to a dog,
feed it to a mongrel.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.137
That would be a bummer.

01:05:35.348 --> 01:05:37.010
I don't believe
that for a minute.

01:05:37.225 --> 01:05:40.059
I think you two
will get married,

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:41.351
and Matt and I will get married

01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:44.518
and the four of us are
going to be family together

01:05:44.732 --> 01:05:45.939
and friends together.

01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:47.983
How can you have friends,

01:05:48.194 --> 01:05:50.311
if the person next
to you is the one

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:54.865
who's gonna sell you out to
save his own ass, you know?

01:05:55.076 --> 01:05:56.192
It would be boring,

01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:58.448
imagine if you didn't
have someone to nuke.

01:05:58.663 --> 01:05:59.779
Come on man.

01:05:59.998 --> 01:06:02.081
Do you watch a
lot of Fox News?

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:03.828
I'm a Fox News junkie.

01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:09.380
I like it the way Homer Simpson
likes Duff at Moe's Tavern.

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:12.545
Do you know what Homer
Simpson said to the drug dealer?

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.625
No, what?

01:06:13.845 --> 01:06:14.961
Dohpe!

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:19.682
Oh my
god, oh my god...

01:06:20.018 --> 01:06:22.761
You know, I'm with
Nancy Reagan there.

01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:24.265
Ooh!

01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:28.558
Can you
pass the potato...

01:06:28.776 --> 01:06:30.233
and the macaroni?

01:06:30.445 --> 01:06:31.151
Are there any more
chicken cutlets?

01:06:31.362 --> 01:06:32.227
Here you go, Sammy.

01:06:32.447 --> 01:06:34.313
On your
way, you're Russian.

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:35.864
When you get in, European.

01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:37.486
When you come out,
you're Finnish.

01:06:40.413 --> 01:06:41.529
What does a soda machine

01:06:41.748 --> 01:06:45.367
have in common with
Monica Lewinsky?

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:47.372
Both say insert Bill here.

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:54.842
Oh, let Sarah!

01:06:55.053 --> 01:06:55.759
No.

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:57.051
Come on Sarah.

01:06:57.263 --> 01:06:58.299
I don't know any jokes.

01:06:58.515 --> 01:06:59.426
The jokes
are gluten free.

01:07:02.227 --> 01:07:03.843
I don't know any jokes.

01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:05.602
Don't pressure her,
come on, come on guys.

01:07:05.813 --> 01:07:06.553
I don't know any jokes.

01:07:06.773 --> 01:07:07.763
It's okay, it's okay.

01:07:07.982 --> 01:07:09.393
I got one, I got one.

01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:12.317
This one got me into
a bit of trouble.

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:14.486
Why did the Jewish
guy divorce his wife

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:16.438
when she became a cop?

01:07:16.658 --> 01:07:17.489
Why?

01:07:17.742 --> 01:07:18.949
'Cause Jews can't eat pork.

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:28.412
So we've got
our showcase Night to Shine

01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:32.417
coming up really soon, and
I also have registration

01:07:32.632 --> 01:07:34.749
for the fall semester.

01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:36.459
If anyone wants to
sign up for the fall

01:07:36.678 --> 01:07:38.590
be sure to register and
write your name down

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:41.422
because this registration
goes really quickly.

01:07:41.641 --> 01:07:44.429
There's a clipboard going
around this side of the room,

01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:47.057
but I'm gonna start
another one over here.

01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:49.514
Just put your name down, and
I hope to see you in the fall,

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:50.722
so we can have
more fun together.

01:08:15.633 --> 01:08:18.841
I just don't understand
why you're leaving.

01:08:19.053 --> 01:08:21.670
Why aren't you
coming back, David?

01:08:25.685 --> 01:08:27.926
I don't know, I just can't.

01:08:35.819 --> 01:08:38.312
Can I ask you something, Sarah?

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:40.397
Do you want to live with
your grandmother forever?

01:08:41.993 --> 01:08:43.154
I mean you do want
to grow, right?

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:45.406
You're a grown woman.

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:46.487
Yeah.

01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:48.496
Don't you wanna
have all the things

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:50.495
that normal people have?

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.624
I want to marry you.

01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:58.832
I don't see myself being with
anyone else but you, Sarah.

01:09:00.094 --> 01:09:04.212
If I had to go to Florida,
would you come with me?

01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:10.973
To Florida?

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:13.430
No, no, no, she can't
come to Florida.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:14.890
I don't even know this girl,

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:17.567
and you want her to live
with us for six months?

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:19.189
What if she just
comes for the ride

01:09:19.404 --> 01:09:22.443
and she can stay at Aunt
Evelyn's and Uncle Harry's?

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.446
In Boca.

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:26.698
She's not some girl from
some crazy house though,

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:31.032
she really has it together
and she's beautiful,

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:33.207
and she's Jewish too, mom!

01:09:33.419 --> 01:09:34.705
You'd love her so much,
you'd probably want her

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:37.629
to be your
daughter-in-law one day.

01:09:39.384 --> 01:09:42.752
Maybe, maybe someday
we'll meet her,

01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:45.929
but we don't bring
people to Florida,

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:48.381
especially people that
we don't know, okay?

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.389
That dad and I haven't met so...

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:53.812
Okay, well what if I told you

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:56.481
she's upstairs right
now in my bedroom.

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:58.855
I invited her for the weekend.

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:17.828
Look, this has
no gluten in it,

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:18.958
it's very good,
it's very healthy.

01:10:19.173 --> 01:10:20.414
Wow, it looks really delicious

01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:21.669
and yummy in the tummy.

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:23.500
Potatoes, beets.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:27.134
Here try this try it and tell
me what you think of this.

01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:29.806
Oh I love it, it's
absolutely delicious,

01:10:30.017 --> 01:10:33.431
groovalicious and really
yummy in the tummy.

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:41.602
So, Sarah, how
did you two meet?

01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:45.189
Oh, well Carrie
that's a great question.

01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:48.822
David and I, us two met at
a place

01:10:49.036 --> 01:10:51.494
called the Jewish
Community Center

01:10:51.706 --> 01:10:53.538
and I found the perfect
one, right here.

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:54.706
Mm-hmm

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:56.283
It was a dream come true,

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:58.414
it was very romantic and sexual.

01:10:59.714 --> 01:11:00.420
It was what?

01:11:01.174 --> 01:11:02.915
I mean, Mom, Dad, you see
how happy I am, you know?

01:11:03.384 --> 01:11:05.376
Sarah is the most amazing
thing that ever happened to me.

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:07.336
She's the one for me.

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:12.762
How long did it take to
realize that this was the one?

01:11:12.977 --> 01:11:15.344
We met over a month
ago, but officially,

01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:17.976
we've been going out
for roughly two weeks.

01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:20.103
- Mm-hmm.
- We've been dating.

01:11:20.318 --> 01:11:21.604
Two weeks?

01:11:21.819 --> 01:11:23.526
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:23.738 --> 01:11:24.728
That's 14 days.

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:25.778
Yeah.

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:27.606
Half a month.

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:36.536
If you
have any questions,

01:11:36.751 --> 01:11:37.787
you know what to do, okay?

01:11:38.002 --> 01:11:39.368
Don't worry about
trying to understand.

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:40.794
Just follow the leader!

01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:43.122
That's right, follow
the leader, okay?

01:11:43.341 --> 01:11:45.583
Just pretend you're interested
in what they have to say.

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:47.043
If they laugh, you laugh,

01:11:47.261 --> 01:11:50.174
if they look serious,
you look serious, okay?

01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:51.630
In other words,
I will try my best

01:11:51.849 --> 01:11:54.057
to lighten my load,
take a chill pill

01:11:54.268 --> 01:11:56.180
and have a wonderful time.

01:11:56.395 --> 01:11:58.182
Yeah, we just need to
chill out tonight, okay?

01:11:58.397 --> 01:12:00.389
In other words,
to get the lay of the land,

01:12:00.608 --> 01:12:02.725
cool ourselves off and
have a wonderful time.

01:12:02.944 --> 01:12:03.934
You don't even
have to say that,

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:05.564
just say, yeah okay
cool, that's great.

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:07.772
Okay, cool, take a chill pill,

01:12:08.032 --> 01:12:08.943
lighten our loads...

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:10.114
You know that
saying, less is more?

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:11.442
I remember
perfectly, David.

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:12.447
Yes.

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:13.402
Uncle Jimmy!

01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:14.532
How are ya?

01:12:14.747 --> 01:12:16.534
This is my girlfriend Sarah.

01:12:16.749 --> 01:12:17.409
Girlfriend?

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:19.116
- Yeah.
- Holy moly!

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:20.451
Let me get a look.

01:12:22.463 --> 01:12:23.169
Perfect.

01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:26.749
What did the duck
say to the bartender?

01:12:26.968 --> 01:12:28.550
Come on.
- Here we go again.

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:29.592
It's okay.

01:12:31.055 --> 01:12:31.795
What?

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:33.300
Put it on my bill.

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:36.429
Ha!

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:41.347
Multiple meanings!

01:12:41.566 --> 01:12:43.979
Hi, oh how
lovely to meet you.

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.401
I'm Sarah Silverstein,
David Cohen's girlfriend.

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:48.444
And I love being a
performing artist,

01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:51.148
singing, acting
and working with.

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:53.279
Let me ask you
this, Aunt Jessica,

01:12:53.494 --> 01:12:56.282
or what about you,
what's your name?

01:12:56.497 --> 01:12:58.409
What are your
passions and careers

01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:01.367
that you guys like
to do for fun?

01:13:01.586 --> 01:13:04.249
Well, we love artwork.

01:13:04.505 --> 01:13:08.294
We like to go to art shows,
and we like to travel.

01:13:08.509 --> 01:13:11.172
What kind of art
shows, do you guys like?

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:12.969
We go to a lot of craft shows.

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:14.136
Oh, wow.

01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:20.432
It's a really great
pleasure to meet you,

01:13:20.646 --> 01:13:21.636
what a blessing.

01:13:21.856 --> 01:13:23.722
I really love your outfit too,

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:24.772
I love the color pink,

01:13:24.984 --> 01:13:26.646
it's my second favorite color.

01:13:26.861 --> 01:13:29.524
Thank you, you're
very interesting.

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:33.232
Thank you, it's a
pleasure meeting you too.

01:13:35.953 --> 01:13:38.741
I mean, boy you really
love those garnishes.

01:13:38.956 --> 01:13:40.993
Down the
hatch-a-roonie it goes.

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:42.289
Yep.

01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:43.537
Mmm.

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:46.120
I tasted it, it was
so yummy in the tummy.

01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:49.252
Didn't you have
enough to eat, sweetheart?

01:13:49.467 --> 01:13:50.082
Um.

01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:53.210
Are you all right?

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:54.260
Everybody's okay.
- I'm fine,

01:13:54.472 --> 01:13:55.758
I'm perfectly fine.

01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:05.055
Did he ever tell
you any of his jokes?

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:07.391
Oh, many many
times in the past.

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:09.476
They're a bit, very confusing.

01:14:09.695 --> 01:14:11.436
It took me a lot of time to
process and understand them.

01:14:11.656 --> 01:14:13.488
- Two Jews walk into a bar.
- Right.

01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:14.530
They buy it!

01:14:17.745 --> 01:14:19.407
You know why he cracks me up.

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:20.408
I don't know.

01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:27.286
I love your song.

01:14:27.505 --> 01:14:29.588
- What?
- I love your song.

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:31.836
What was the name of that song?

01:14:32.051 --> 01:14:32.837
Thank you.

01:14:33.052 --> 01:14:34.918
We have to clear out
the boathouse for Matt.

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:35.923
Matt's here?

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:37.470
In the boathouse.

01:14:37.682 --> 01:14:39.389
Matt, my cousin,
Matt, Matt Cone.

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:46.388
Ladies first.

01:14:46.607 --> 01:14:47.438
Thank you.

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:48.436
Just walk on the pebbles.

01:14:48.651 --> 01:14:49.437
Okay.

01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:52.569
On the pebbles,
on the pebbles.

01:14:53.614 --> 01:14:55.196
No, on the pebbles.

01:14:56.117 --> 01:14:57.904
Yeah, step down.

01:14:58.119 --> 01:14:59.610
It's okay, it's okay.

01:15:01.455 --> 01:15:02.662
I got you, I got you.

01:15:02.873 --> 01:15:03.613
Oh, sand.

01:15:05.626 --> 01:15:06.992
I'm on the sand,
you're on the rocks.

01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:10.830
See, we're on our
way to the party.

01:15:12.591 --> 01:15:14.753
See, you're not
getting muddy at all.

01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:17.552
Ooh, you don't have to
step on that rock but,

01:15:17.763 --> 01:15:19.345
yeah, here we are.

01:15:20.391 --> 01:15:21.472
We live our
lives, we're busy,

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:22.970
and all this stuff going on.

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:24.551
Yeah, but
that kind of implies

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:26.056
that like you're not present
enough with each other

01:15:26.313 --> 01:15:27.724
on a day-to-day basis
enough to know that...

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:29.602
Yo, Matt!

01:15:29.817 --> 01:15:30.978
What's up Matt?

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:32.434
Whoa, David, holy...

01:15:32.653 --> 01:15:34.189
Dude, I can't
believe you're here.

01:15:34.405 --> 01:15:35.441
What's going on?

01:15:35.656 --> 01:15:38.114
Yo, it's my girlfriend, Sarah.

01:15:38.325 --> 01:15:39.156
Your girlfriend?

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:40.950
- Yeah, my girlfriend.
- Yeah?

01:15:41.162 --> 01:15:41.993
Is he paying you?

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:42.990
Shut up, Matt!

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:44.321
Oh, I'm just kidding.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:45.906
You're just pulling
my chain, Matt.

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:47.282
Yes, I am, Sarah.

01:15:47.501 --> 01:15:48.366
I'm sorry, I have a
messed up sense of humor.

01:15:48.586 --> 01:15:50.168
It's cool man, it's cool, yo.

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:51.495
Yeah, come on
in, celebrate with us.

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:52.420
Let's make this
a bigger holiday.

01:15:52.631 --> 01:15:53.621
Yeah.

01:15:53.841 --> 01:15:54.831
Yeah, so you
remember Karen of course.

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:55.757
Hey Karen, how are you?

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:56.708
How are you?

01:15:56.927 --> 01:15:57.838
And Julia...

01:15:58.054 --> 01:15:59.170
Hi, nice to meet you.

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:00.219
What's up Luke?

01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:01.638
What's up David?

01:16:01.849 --> 01:16:02.555
- What's up man?
- Good to see you brother.

01:16:02.767 --> 01:16:03.382
And this is...

01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:04.512
Sarah.

01:16:04.727 --> 01:16:05.558
Hi Sarah.

01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:06.556
Sit down, you guys, please.

01:16:07.146 --> 01:16:09.058
Thank you guys
so much for hosting us.

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.647
Thank
you for having us.

01:16:10.858 --> 01:16:12.440
So this is David's place
that we are crashing at.

01:16:12.651 --> 01:16:14.142
David, this is
amazing, thanks for having us.

01:16:14.361 --> 01:16:16.318
Thank you, it's an honor
having you guys here.

01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:17.611
- Yeah, it's an amazing honor
- It's our pleasure.

01:16:17.823 --> 01:16:18.779
for us to be here with...
- I mean the star

01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:21.108
of Malibu Mohawks, a movie star.

01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:23.109
No, no, no...

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:24.786
He loves
it, he loves it.

01:16:25.664 --> 01:16:26.575
Not talking
about that right now.

01:16:27.124 --> 01:16:28.786
Why don't you
tell him our other news.

01:16:29.001 --> 01:16:30.708
- Oh my god.
- I popped the question!

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.912
Wow, you're getting married?

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:34.416
- Yeah.
- You said yes?

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.001
Yeah, I said yes,
I'm wearing the ring.

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:37.381
Of course!

01:16:37.718 --> 01:16:38.504
Congratulations, mazel tov!

01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:39.505
Thank you.

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:41.131
So are we!

01:16:41.347 --> 01:16:42.679
You guys too?

01:16:43.057 --> 01:16:44.173
We've been
discussing it lately,

01:16:44.683 --> 01:16:46.049
like in theory and
all that, you know?

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:47.850
You don't waste
any time, huh man?

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:49.515
- Are you nervous?
- It's been the best

01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:51.062
two weeks of my life.

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:53.390
Yeah, David was especially
really, really nervous...

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:54.690
No I'm not...

01:16:54.902 --> 01:16:59.021
Yes, it's about the penis
going inside the vagina.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:16:59.946
- Oh?
- No, no, no.

01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:01.193
But I definitely did teach him

01:17:01.408 --> 01:17:03.274
how to have sexual intercourse,

01:17:03.494 --> 01:17:07.704
in a very constructive way,
for the very first time

01:17:07.915 --> 01:17:10.282
at my bedroom in my apartment.

01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:11.582
Use a condom.

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:15.504
Oh I love condoms,

01:17:15.714 --> 01:17:17.000
I live in a condom!

01:17:19.552 --> 01:17:21.509
She's
just very sheltered,

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.131
she thought you're
talking about condos.

01:17:24.682 --> 01:17:26.924
Not only am I very innocent

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:29.180
and really beautiful princess,

01:17:29.395 --> 01:17:33.435
but I'm a lyric soprano
singer with perfect pitch.

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:55.209
Okay.

01:17:56.755 --> 01:17:58.212
That's wonderful, isn't it?

01:17:58.424 --> 01:17:59.756
That's great, okay?

01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:01.253
Okay, okay.

01:18:01.468 --> 01:18:02.083
She's got a nice voice.

01:18:02.428 --> 01:18:04.169
Please stop, please
stop, please stop.

01:18:17.193 --> 01:18:17.899
Please stop!

01:18:19.862 --> 01:18:21.194
Stop it, zip it!

01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:23.897
Please, please, I'm
sorry, just please,

01:18:24.116 --> 01:18:25.277
I'm sorry you're right in my ear

01:18:25.492 --> 01:18:28.405
and piercing my ears, okay?

01:18:28.621 --> 01:18:29.407
Okay, please?

01:18:29.622 --> 01:18:30.453
Please?

01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:34.161
I mean, Matt
was applauding it.

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:35.833
I know, I know, but
you don't understand.

01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:39.504
People are clapping because
they're trying to be polite,

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:40.796
they don't like your music...

01:18:41.008 --> 01:18:41.998
I was just...

01:18:42.218 --> 01:18:43.254
You're
embarrassing me,

01:18:43.469 --> 01:18:44.550
I was just...

01:18:44.762 --> 01:18:46.128
in front of some
very important people.

01:18:46.347 --> 01:18:48.839
You're even
embarrassing yourself.

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:50.139
Just trust me.

01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:51.558
Okay?

01:18:52.645 --> 01:18:55.012
So, how about this?

01:18:55.231 --> 01:18:58.099
A guy walks into
a sex shop, right?

01:18:58.317 --> 01:18:59.524
And he says, I want
an inflatable doll.

01:20:31.368 --> 01:20:32.324
What's wrong?

01:20:32.536 --> 01:20:33.367
Where's Sarah?

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:35.365
Well, she begged
me to take her home.

01:20:35.581 --> 01:20:37.493
Geraldo's driving her back.

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:39.950
What happened?

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:43.745
Nothing.

01:20:45.090 --> 01:20:45.830
Okay.

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:14.366
The mailbox is full

01:21:14.578 --> 01:21:15.443
and cannot accept any messages

01:21:15.662 --> 01:21:17.528
at this time, goodbye.

01:21:31.428 --> 01:21:34.011
David, give me some
of the lox please.

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:37.298
David.

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:44.313
David, will you
pass dad the lox,

01:21:44.525 --> 01:21:46.858
we've asked you three times.

01:21:48.487 --> 01:21:50.023
Thanks, honey.

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:51.025
You okay?

01:21:53.158 --> 01:21:55.946
He's a little upset
about that girl.

01:21:56.161 --> 01:21:58.073
Oh, your bride?

01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:59.411
Are you joking?

01:21:59.623 --> 01:22:02.036
Nevermind, it
is a private joke.

01:22:04.711 --> 01:22:06.828
Oh, it would have
been a lot, sweetheart,

01:22:07.047 --> 01:22:08.379
with all you go through,

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:11.253
to take care of someone
with problems like that.

01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:13.425
What was her issue anyway?

01:22:13.637 --> 01:22:15.003
She had an LD.

01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:17.756
An LD, what's that?

01:22:17.975 --> 01:22:19.466
Learning disability.

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:21.768
Oh, I'd say more than that.

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:25.101
Was she brain damaged?

01:22:25.315 --> 01:22:26.396
I mean, you'd ask
her a simple question

01:22:26.608 --> 01:22:28.474
and she'd talk your head off.

01:22:28.694 --> 01:22:31.152
It was a non-verbal
learning disability.

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:35.403
She also ate a dozen radish
roses off my fish platter.

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:37.950
A dozen radishes,
I'm not kidding.

01:22:38.245 --> 01:22:40.157
I thought she was sweet.

01:22:41.331 --> 01:22:42.447
She was weird.

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:46.789
David, better you
should find someone

01:22:47.004 --> 01:22:51.339
who maybe is more advanced
at things than you are.

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:55.464
Like, Melinda, that
girl you used to date?

01:22:55.679 --> 01:22:57.716
Angie, whatever
happened to Angie?

01:22:57.931 --> 01:23:00.139
The girls from the internet.

01:23:07.566 --> 01:23:09.683
Well, we go to
Florida next week.

01:23:09.902 --> 01:23:11.484
Maybe that'll cheer him up.

01:23:13.947 --> 01:23:17.406
I liked her because
she was weird, Mom.

01:23:20.496 --> 01:23:21.907
I'm weird too.

01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:32.376
What do you think
about this for Annie,

01:23:32.591 --> 01:23:33.581
and this for Zach?

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.132
Sammy!

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:36.801
Is Sarah backstage?

01:23:37.054 --> 01:23:38.090
I really need to
speak to her, okay?

01:23:38.305 --> 01:23:40.467
Backstage is for actors
who want to be in my play,

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:42.799
not for actors who called
it a load of bullshit,

01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:44.225
like you called it.

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:46.598
I want to be an actor
in your play, okay?

01:23:46.813 --> 01:23:48.770
I'll even go
butt-naked if you want.

01:23:48.982 --> 01:23:50.769
I'll even do a gay
sex scene with you,

01:23:50.984 --> 01:23:52.600
just let me see Sarah.

01:23:52.819 --> 01:23:53.980
After what you did to her,

01:23:54.196 --> 01:23:57.655
she decided she wants
nothing to do with you,

01:23:57.866 --> 01:24:00.483
so please go away, you asshole.

01:24:21.557 --> 01:24:24.470
The other day my dad
said he wanted some wine,

01:24:24.685 --> 01:24:27.519
"Dad, do I have to?"

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:29.812
I get very angry
when innocent people

01:24:30.023 --> 01:24:30.934
get hurt by bullies.

01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:33.562
And it is my job
to protect them!

01:24:35.362 --> 01:24:39.652
Try to find, what's
going on in their mind,

01:24:39.866 --> 01:24:43.985
when you see somebody
who's in need.

01:24:44.204 --> 01:24:46.412
For those of you
who don't know me,

01:24:46.623 --> 01:24:48.364
my name is Jared Klimber

01:24:48.584 --> 01:24:51.748
and I'm from the south
shore of Long Island.

01:24:51.962 --> 01:24:55.626
I would like to take a
moment just because...

01:24:56.508 --> 01:24:58.420
What do you do with
the mad that you feel

01:24:58.635 --> 01:25:01.298
when you feel so
mad you could bite?

01:25:01.513 --> 01:25:04.597
What do you say
when you see a fawn?

01:25:04.808 --> 01:25:06.049
Oh dear?

01:25:21.074 --> 01:25:23.316
Hi, I'm Sarah.

01:25:23.619 --> 01:25:27.283
I really want to take this
time to show the entire world

01:25:27.497 --> 01:25:29.739
my musical theater beauty-glow.

01:27:44.217 --> 01:27:46.174
You getting on or not?

01:27:48.597 --> 01:27:50.554
You getting on or not, man?

01:27:59.191 --> 01:28:00.932
Here, keep the change.

01:28:01.151 --> 01:28:02.392
Exact change.

01:28:07.365 --> 01:28:08.071
$2.75.

01:28:13.205 --> 01:28:15.913
One, two...

01:28:21.338 --> 01:28:24.126
Sorry, I've never
been on a bus before.

01:28:28.678 --> 01:28:31.386
Do you
have $2.75, sir?

01:28:33.809 --> 01:28:38.019
One, two, three, um...

01:28:44.361 --> 01:28:45.272
Sarah?

01:28:56.456 --> 01:28:58.368
I don't know how much...

01:29:04.381 --> 01:29:06.668
Nope, just one more quarter.
