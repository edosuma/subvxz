WEBVTT

00:27.360 --> 00:28.762
Training with Dad?

00:31.431 --> 00:32.432
Yeah.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.337
So...
nothing's changed since I left.

00:38.505 --> 00:40.407
Why are you here, Jade?

00:40.507 --> 00:42.075
Why am I here, Artemis?

00:42.175 --> 00:43.610
I know, I know.
Mom warned,

00:43.710 --> 00:45.378
I shouldn't make contact
unless it was an emergency...

00:45.445 --> 00:48.581
Life-threatening
emergency for Lian!

00:48.681 --> 00:50.283
And only because
Will's not a match

00:50.383 --> 00:51.851
for her blood or tissue type.

00:51.918 --> 00:56.056
I already told her Lian is safe
and asleep upstairs.

00:56.122 --> 00:58.558
So you'd better have
a damn good reason for...

00:58.625 --> 00:59.726
Will could be home any minute,

00:59.793 --> 01:01.261
so unless you want to see him,

01:01.361 --> 01:03.463
maybe we should take
this conversation elsewhere.

01:03.563 --> 01:04.731
Or I could just leave,

01:04.798 --> 01:06.900
which likewise
solves the problem.

01:06.966 --> 01:08.735
Fine, fine.

01:08.802 --> 01:11.237
I have two defectors
from the League of Shadows

01:11.304 --> 01:12.772
seeking asylum.

01:12.872 --> 01:15.775
Each one claims
the other is a plant,
a mole.

01:15.875 --> 01:17.944
I need your help
to sort it all out.

01:18.044 --> 01:19.946
You know I left
the Shadows years ago.

01:20.046 --> 01:21.815
Couldn't help if I wanted to.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.617
And I don't want to.

01:24.717 --> 01:26.619
The Shadows
tracked me here.

01:26.719 --> 01:29.556
Here, the house
where your daughter lives.

01:33.126 --> 01:34.260
What do you need?

02:13.533 --> 02:16.102
<i>Recognized...
Robin-D-one-two...</i>

02:16.169 --> 02:18.972
Hurricane Amy
just doubled in size
and keeps growing.

02:19.038 --> 02:21.374
Flash flooding in Florida,
stranded citizens...

02:21.474 --> 02:23.710
- We suspect Weather Wizard.
- Or global warming.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.879
The Outsiders
are headed into the storm.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.113
You coming?

02:27.180 --> 02:29.149
Uh, I'm still really
javelin-lagged

02:29.215 --> 02:31.050
after the trip back from Mars.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.386
I... I wouldn't be
much help right now.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.889
Think I'm just gonna crash
for a few hours.

02:35.989 --> 02:36.856
Crash?

02:37.557 --> 02:39.792
Um... crash.

02:39.859 --> 02:41.394
You can handle this, right?

02:41.494 --> 02:43.029
Uh, sure.

02:43.129 --> 02:44.230
We gotcha covered!

02:44.330 --> 02:45.331
Thanks.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.202
He's been sleeping a lot,
hasn't he?

02:49.302 --> 02:50.503
Yeah.

02:50.570 --> 02:52.172
Come on. Mission time.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.066
I telepathically
read them.

03:20.166 --> 03:21.935
They both seem sincere.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.037
Is it possible
both are telling the truth

03:24.103 --> 03:25.438
to the best of their knowledge?

03:25.538 --> 03:27.941
Anything's possible.
That's the problem.

03:29.776 --> 03:33.279
Orphan says
the Shadows are trained
to thwart psychic readings.

03:33.379 --> 03:34.847
You think
that's happening here?

03:34.914 --> 03:37.450
I'm no Miss Martian.

03:37.550 --> 03:38.751
I can't be sure.

03:38.851 --> 03:40.687
Is there anyone else
you can call?

03:43.423 --> 03:45.258
Why are you here, Jade?

03:45.358 --> 03:46.426
It's been a while.

03:46.526 --> 03:47.894
Thought I'd check up on you.

03:50.630 --> 03:52.398
I've hit a rough patch.

03:52.465 --> 03:54.300
Thought you could
raid the fridge for me.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.403
No. She can't.

03:57.470 --> 04:01.241
You thought you could
make it on your own,
little girl.

04:01.307 --> 04:03.910
- I can.
- Then prove it.

04:08.047 --> 04:10.617
Fine. If you're gonna
get all angry about it,

04:10.717 --> 04:11.985
I'll just go.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.220
You know, you're not
the only one who's angry.

04:14.287 --> 04:16.289
We're all mad here...

04:16.389 --> 04:17.724
Mad as hatters.

04:27.567 --> 04:29.769
So, obviously,
the beast and I

04:29.836 --> 04:31.638
are out for our nightly jog.

04:31.738 --> 04:34.907
You, on the other hand,
are just sitting alone...

04:34.974 --> 04:36.743
in the park... at night.

04:36.809 --> 04:38.444
That's, uh... odd, right?

04:38.511 --> 04:39.646
Not at all.

04:39.746 --> 04:41.681
It's the ideal spot
for my meeting

04:41.781 --> 04:43.583
with an international assassin.

04:43.650 --> 04:46.586
Ooh, is he a handsome
international assassin?

04:46.653 --> 04:48.955
What makes you think
it's a "he"?

04:49.022 --> 04:50.990
Strangely,
I'm even more jealous now.

04:52.859 --> 04:56.162
You have nothing
to be jealous of.

04:56.262 --> 04:59.032
I hate to interrupt
this tender scene...

05:00.166 --> 05:02.435
Aren't you going
to introduce us?

05:02.502 --> 05:03.870
Uh, of course.

05:03.970 --> 05:07.340
- Holly, meet my sister, Jade.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.709
I think she might have
meant me.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.613
Sister Jade,
this is Jason Bard,

05:13.680 --> 05:15.982
my uh... boyfriend.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.650
Wow! I'm your boyfriend?

05:17.717 --> 05:20.219
That's the first time
you've said that out loud.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.554
Calm down
before I take it back.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.389
The boyfriend, huh?

05:23.489 --> 05:26.059
- Let's see... dog lover?
- Check.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.727
- Ex-military?
- Check.

05:27.827 --> 05:28.861
College professor?

05:28.961 --> 05:30.229
Erm... W-Working on that.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.631
I'm a private detective now.

05:31.698 --> 05:33.666
Ooh, a private dick.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.969
So, how'd you meet?

05:37.036 --> 05:38.871
My, um, ex fixed us up

05:38.971 --> 05:41.741
when she dumped me
for her ex,

05:41.841 --> 05:45.044
and I moved to Star City
from Gotham to get my degree.

05:45.144 --> 05:47.480
Artemis always got
my hand-me-downs, too.

05:47.547 --> 05:48.881
Okay, that's enough.

05:48.981 --> 05:50.149
She really is an assassin.

05:50.216 --> 05:51.684
Escape while you can.

05:51.751 --> 05:53.486
And your little dog, too.

05:57.557 --> 05:59.192
- Run!
Running!

06:00.226 --> 06:01.661
I like him.

06:01.728 --> 06:04.163
- I'm happy for you.
- Thanks.

06:04.230 --> 06:07.166
I know it's been hard since...

06:07.233 --> 06:10.236
It just goes to show...

06:10.336 --> 06:12.905
second chances are possible.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.343
What did you learn?

06:17.410 --> 06:19.045
My sources
all have the same intel.

06:19.112 --> 06:22.115
The Savage kid's on the run
and being hunted.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.017
Meanwhile, no one's
even heard of this Onyx.

06:25.084 --> 06:28.955
In my business,
that means you're either
a nobody or a ghost.

06:29.055 --> 06:32.058
A nobody's never making it
off Santa Prisca alive.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.559
And a ghost...

06:33.626 --> 06:36.262
you don't want anything
to do with one of those.

06:36.362 --> 06:38.531
Well, Looker read
both defectors psychically

06:38.598 --> 06:41.100
and sensed no deception
from either of them.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.436
But Orphan tells me
Shadows are trained

06:43.536 --> 06:44.804
to thwart psychic reads.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.372
Who's this Orphan?

06:46.439 --> 06:47.640
She's on my team.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.942
She's a kid,
but she escaped the Shadows

06:50.042 --> 06:51.778
and has Batman's
seal of approval.

06:51.878 --> 06:54.480
And if the Bat
says she's cool,

06:54.580 --> 06:56.983
- you're just supposed to...
- Yes.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.085
Well, she's right
about Shadow training.

06:59.152 --> 07:02.321
Don't suppose you'd be willing
to just kill them both.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.490
That would solve your problem.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.592
Fine. Fine.
Get me in with them.

07:06.659 --> 07:08.761
I know what questions to ask...

07:08.828 --> 07:11.397
and what responses to look for.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.603
Closing in on target now.

07:17.670 --> 07:20.106
<i>Remember,
we want Cassandra alive.</i>

07:20.173 --> 07:22.341
Oh,
she'll be a special delivery!

07:22.442 --> 07:23.843
Handled with care.

07:23.943 --> 07:27.180
As for whatever other packages
might be on the porch...

07:27.280 --> 07:29.849
<i>Do whatever damage
is necessary.</i>

07:29.949 --> 07:32.018
<i>But bring Cassandra back.</i>

07:32.118 --> 07:34.086
Roger that, boss.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.505
Wasn't sure
you'd remember
our little meet-up code.

07:52.605 --> 07:55.107
"Mad as hatters"?
Of course I remember!

07:55.174 --> 07:58.177
Plus your weird love
of these freeze-dried
Chicken Whizees.

07:58.277 --> 08:00.179
Blech! I'm happy
to give you those

08:00.279 --> 08:01.981
and whatever else
I could scrounge.

08:02.048 --> 08:03.216
Thanks, sis.

08:04.684 --> 08:07.019
It's called "Soh Dah"
in Vietnamese.

08:07.119 --> 08:09.021
The English title's <i>Dumb Luck.</i>

08:09.121 --> 08:10.523
Thought you might like it.

08:11.858 --> 08:13.559
You stole this, didn't you?

08:13.659 --> 08:15.061
Like you didn't steal this?

08:15.161 --> 08:17.897
You're family.
It's not stealing.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.132
Not sure Crusher would agree.

08:20.199 --> 08:21.501
When's he gonna be back?

08:21.567 --> 08:23.903
He said 36 hours.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.339
No worries.
I'll come back tomorrow night

08:26.405 --> 08:28.541
with enough money
for you to restock.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.409
- Promise?
- Of course.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.079
We're all mad as hatters here.

08:35.648 --> 08:39.552
<i>Recognized...
Tigress-B-zero-seven.</i>

08:39.652 --> 08:42.922
Okay, Spoiler,
I'm here to relieve...

08:43.022 --> 08:45.558
Yeah, I came for my shift
to relieve her,

08:45.658 --> 08:46.859
but she wouldn't leave.

08:46.926 --> 08:48.528
- Any problems?
- No.

08:48.594 --> 08:49.862
They've been quiet.

08:49.929 --> 08:51.264
Good. You're relieved.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.400
You can go. You can both go.

08:55.935 --> 08:57.103
You coming?

08:57.203 --> 08:59.272
Orphan, really,
I've got this covered.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.074
Good luck.

09:02.174 --> 09:03.943
<i>Recognized...
Spoiler-B-two-eight.</i>

09:04.043 --> 09:05.845
Orphan, go.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.514
Or I'll call Batman.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.718
Fine.

09:12.785 --> 09:14.353
Just don't tell anyone
what you see here tonight.

09:14.420 --> 09:16.522
<i>Bypass authorized.</i>

09:21.394 --> 09:22.628
Put the sword away.

09:22.728 --> 09:23.963
I know you probably learned

09:24.063 --> 09:26.065
all about Cheshire
from the Bats.

09:26.132 --> 09:28.200
But she is my sister,

09:28.267 --> 09:30.202
and another defector
from the Shadows.

09:30.269 --> 09:32.538
It's like an epidemic.

09:32.605 --> 09:35.107
She's here to help.
We can trust her.

09:35.207 --> 09:37.476
- More or less.
I need her...

09:37.577 --> 09:39.145
for the mission.

10:02.134 --> 10:05.271
<i>As part of his ever-expanding
multimedia campaign,</i>

10:05.338 --> 10:07.173

First question...
- You're Jade Nguyen!

10:52.818 --> 10:54.854
Cheshire! The one who got away!

10:54.954 --> 10:57.723
Yeah, yeah,
you've been trained
to kill me on sight.

10:57.823 --> 10:58.724
No!

10:58.824 --> 11:00.026
I mean, yes, but...

11:00.126 --> 11:02.795
you're the one
who gave me hope...

11:02.862 --> 11:04.363
hope I could escape!

11:06.132 --> 11:08.300
Screw hope.
Let's get to it.

11:08.367 --> 11:09.568
I know who Savage is.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.038
But who are you, Onyx Adams?

11:12.138 --> 11:13.706
How'd you end up a Shadow?

11:13.806 --> 11:15.207
Or let me guess...

11:15.307 --> 11:17.410
<i>broken parents,
broken home?</i>

11:17.510 --> 11:20.146
<i>I think that's your story.</i>

11:20.212 --> 11:22.481
I was raised by
my maternal grandfather.

11:22.548 --> 11:23.916
And he was a hero.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.518
Will Everett, the Amazing Man.

11:25.584 --> 11:27.753
I'm supposed to know
who that is?

11:27.853 --> 11:31.757
Yeah, well...

11:31.857 --> 11:34.093
I was recruited
into the Shadows

11:34.193 --> 11:36.062
at age 11 by Sensei.

11:36.162 --> 11:38.597
Sensei? Sensei himself?

11:38.698 --> 11:40.599
He promised he could train me

11:40.700 --> 11:42.835
to be the best version
of myself.

11:42.902 --> 11:46.272
And for a while,
I believed him...

11:46.372 --> 11:48.407
Why did you leave the Shadows?

11:48.507 --> 11:50.076
It's not just the Shadows.

11:50.176 --> 11:51.277
It's the Light.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.279
It's everything
my father touches.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.081
Because he killed your sister?

11:55.181 --> 11:56.282
Because he took your arm?

11:56.382 --> 11:57.683
Because he's without anything

11:57.750 --> 12:00.586
resembling human emotion
and feeling.

12:00.686 --> 12:03.222
<i>He took me
from my mother
when I was four.</i>

12:03.289 --> 12:05.024
<i>He told me she was dead.</i>

12:05.091 --> 12:09.428
Then shortly after he killed
my sister Olympia,
who raised me...

12:09.528 --> 12:12.631
I learned my mother
was alive and well.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.900
She had a husband,
and two more children,

12:14.967 --> 12:16.402
my half-brother and sister...

12:16.469 --> 12:18.938
<i>Vandal cheated me
out of my childhood,</i>

12:19.038 --> 12:20.372
<i>my family,</i>

12:20.439 --> 12:22.074
<i>so he could turn me
into his puppet...</i>

12:22.141 --> 12:23.576
<i>his one-armed puppet...</i>

12:23.642 --> 12:26.378
<i>for his little
cult of personality.</i>

12:26.445 --> 12:28.314
It was good at first...

12:28.414 --> 12:30.282
on Infinity Island.

12:30.382 --> 12:32.318
We were like a family.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.320
It was tough love...

12:34.420 --> 12:37.990
Still, I felt like
I was part of something.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.926
But when the Shadows
moved to Santa Prisca...

12:40.993 --> 12:46.832
When the Great One and Sensei
were replaced by Deathstroke
and Lady Shiva,

12:46.932 --> 12:48.968
<i>I realized
I was just being used</i>

12:49.068 --> 12:50.936
<i>as little more than a weapon.</i>

12:51.003 --> 12:53.606
Why Tigress?
How did you find her?

12:53.672 --> 12:56.175
Shiva sent Manta Troopers out
a few weeks ago.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.777
That's how we knew
Tigress was leading

12:57.843 --> 12:59.912
the Justice League's
covert unit.

12:59.979 --> 13:01.614
That felt right.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.150
Like she was the one
I should reach out to.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.753
<i>Besides,
she's Sportsmaster's daughter.</i>

13:07.820 --> 13:09.622
<i>I thought she'd understand.</i>

13:09.688 --> 13:11.323
How? Are you kidding?

13:11.423 --> 13:12.858
She still goes
by Artemis Crock.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.593
It took me
three minutes on the internet.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.597
Wait. You've gotta believe...

13:18.664 --> 13:21.033
The other one says
you're a plant, a mole.

13:21.133 --> 13:25.538
Meanwhile, your body language
underscores all you say
all too perfectly...

13:25.638 --> 13:28.507
textbook counter
interrogation tradecraft.

13:28.607 --> 13:32.211
You've used every Shadow trick
in the book to deceive me.

13:32.311 --> 13:35.181
I don't trust you.

13:36.816 --> 13:40.019
Look, I've been a Shadow
since I was 11.

13:40.119 --> 13:43.189
I don't know how not to
manipulate my responses.

13:43.289 --> 13:45.825
But I swear to you
I want to learn.

13:45.891 --> 13:49.395
I just want to learn
how to be a human being again.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.063
And I should trust you?

13:51.163 --> 13:53.365
I came here for protection.

13:53.465 --> 13:55.401
I mean, I understand,
your sister called you in

13:55.501 --> 13:57.870
because it takes a Shadow
to know a Shadow.

13:57.970 --> 14:01.574
But, really,
why are you even here?

14:01.674 --> 14:03.742
Are you one of the heroes now?

14:05.211 --> 14:06.712
They're either
telling the truth,

14:06.812 --> 14:08.547
or they're both very good.

14:08.647 --> 14:11.250
I still say our best bet
is to kill them both.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.086
We're not killing anyone.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.188
Then my job's done.

14:16.255 --> 14:18.591
You need to get better
at covering your tracks

14:18.691 --> 14:20.893
if you're going to live
in the same house
as my daughter...

14:20.993 --> 14:25.397
Or maybe Lian needs
both Crock sisters
living in that house.

14:25.497 --> 14:27.666
You know,
just to keep her safe.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.905
If you're
not going to kill them,

15:05.971 --> 15:07.573
you'll just have to
trust your gut.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.807
I hate to admit it,

15:08.908 --> 15:11.043
but no one's
got better instincts.

15:13.812 --> 15:15.814
How the hell...

15:17.549 --> 15:19.151
Aww,
now why'd ol' Rictus

15:19.251 --> 15:21.053
have to break up
that tender scene?

15:21.120 --> 15:23.989
I was so enjoying seein'
Cheshire's softer side.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.158
- This is as soft as I get.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.761
Orphan, Cheshire!
Take down Black Spider!

15:28.827 --> 15:29.995
Alive!

15:31.764 --> 15:32.798
Ah!

15:32.898 --> 15:34.166
Rictus.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.268
Do you really believe
you have what it takes

15:36.335 --> 15:39.138
to bring down
the daughter of Vandal Savage?

15:50.783 --> 15:52.084
Shh.

15:52.151 --> 15:53.485
No need for words.

15:53.585 --> 15:56.822
Leave the banter to the Spider.

15:56.922 --> 15:59.525
Don't ya just love my balls?

15:59.625 --> 16:02.928
Hot, sticky web balls!
Comin' at you.

16:02.995 --> 16:04.830
Someone's overcompensating.

16:04.930 --> 16:06.332
Tigress, what are you doing?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.434
Trusting my gut!

16:08.500 --> 16:09.468
Come on out!

16:09.535 --> 16:10.703
Grab your gear!

16:10.803 --> 16:12.037
You need to help me
protect Cassandra!

16:12.137 --> 16:13.372
Are you crazy?
She's the mole.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.640
You want to prove yourself?

16:14.707 --> 16:15.874
Back me up!

16:24.516 --> 16:25.384
Freeze!

16:28.120 --> 16:28.954
Ah!

16:38.163 --> 16:39.565
Yoink!

16:39.665 --> 16:41.400
I remember
when the only thing

16:41.500 --> 16:43.335
more disarming than my webs...

16:43.402 --> 16:46.538
was your
disarming smile, Chesh.

16:47.873 --> 16:49.541
Now you just look sad.

16:52.478 --> 16:53.846
Ah-ah-ah.

16:53.912 --> 16:56.148
Hasn't anyone ever told you
not to play with guns?

16:56.215 --> 16:58.150
Hasn't anyone told you?

16:58.217 --> 16:59.651
Duh... Oh-oh.

16:59.718 --> 17:00.819
Ah!

17:01.520 --> 17:03.856
Ow!

17:06.425 --> 17:09.094
Finally remember
why I was your boss?

17:09.194 --> 17:11.930
What I remember
is how you betrayed us all.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.034
For a guy. Cliche much?

17:25.577 --> 17:29.114
<i>Not recognized.
Access denied.</i>

17:50.469 --> 17:51.737
Well, crap.

17:56.608 --> 18:00.646
The legendary Crock sisters
working together.

18:00.746 --> 18:04.116
Quite the family reunion
we have here today.

18:05.384 --> 18:09.088
Lady Shiva. Let Orphan go.

18:10.122 --> 18:11.423
No.

18:11.490 --> 18:14.593
Since you refuse
to surrender what's mine,

18:14.660 --> 18:16.728
I'm taking what's yours.

18:16.795 --> 18:19.665
If you want
this "hero" back alive,

18:19.765 --> 18:21.900
you'll bring that...

18:21.967 --> 18:23.836
to Santa Prisca.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.739
Leave your metas, your team
and the various bats at home...

18:27.806 --> 18:30.142
or this "Orphan" dies.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.511
Uh-uh.

18:32.611 --> 18:33.912
I mean it.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.424
You have 24 hours.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.131
Damn it!

18:52.197 --> 18:54.199
Take me back to Santa Prisca.

18:54.299 --> 18:56.635
- Look, you don't have to...
- I didn't come here

18:56.702 --> 18:59.371
to trade
someone else's life for mine.

18:59.471 --> 19:02.040
That's something
my father would do.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.376
I still think
this is some kind of setup.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.178
She can't be trusted.

19:06.278 --> 19:08.514
So if she's going,
you'll need someone
to watch your back.

19:08.614 --> 19:11.216
Or you want to come along
to stab us in the backs.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.152
Enough. You're both coming.

19:13.218 --> 19:14.520
You can't be serious.

19:14.620 --> 19:17.222
Don't take these two,
take your team!

19:17.322 --> 19:18.557
You heard Shiva.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.292
I can't risk Orphan's life.

19:20.359 --> 19:23.362
Orphan? You mean
Lady Shiva's daughter?

19:23.462 --> 19:24.730
What?

19:24.830 --> 19:27.065
Oh, the Bat didn't tell you
that part, did he?

19:27.166 --> 19:29.001
Listen, when I was a Shadow,

19:29.067 --> 19:30.869
Shiva was raising
her own daughter

19:30.969 --> 19:34.706
to be the ultimate assassin,
the ultimate weapon.

19:34.806 --> 19:36.508
She wouldn't
teach her to read...

19:36.575 --> 19:40.045
even had the girl's
vocal chords severed
as an infant...

19:40.145 --> 19:43.081
so that her only language
would be body language...

19:43.182 --> 19:46.585
the language of Shadows,
of death.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.588
I recognized those scars
on Orphan's throat.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.157
She is Cassandra Wu-San,

19:52.224 --> 19:54.860
Shiva's daughter.

19:54.927 --> 19:58.597
No wonder Shiva and my father
get along so well.

19:58.697 --> 20:02.534
All the more reason
to get Orphan back safely.

20:02.601 --> 20:06.071
Please. Shiva was bluffing
to lure you to Santa Prisca.

20:06.171 --> 20:08.040
She won't kill
her own daughter.

20:08.106 --> 20:09.107
Can you be sure?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.009
My father murdered my sister.

20:11.076 --> 20:12.844
Those people
can justify anything.

20:12.911 --> 20:15.080
Bad as Crusher was,

20:15.180 --> 20:18.183
I never worried
he'd kill one of us...

20:18.250 --> 20:22.187
Can you promise me
Shiva won't kill Orphan?

20:24.523 --> 20:26.625
I never thought I'd go back.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.260
But I'm still in.

20:28.860 --> 20:29.962
So am I.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.396
Then we're going.

20:31.463 --> 20:34.233
And I could use your help.

20:35.901 --> 20:36.802
Forget it.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.105
You're all mad
as hatters, here.

20:41.273 --> 20:43.475
Let me out. Now.

20:48.547 --> 20:50.315
<i>Bypass authorized.</i>

21:04.830 --> 21:07.099
<i>Promise?
Of course.</i>

21:07.165 --> 21:09.735
<i>We're all
mad as hatters here.</i>

21:35.761 --> 21:39.197
You gave Jade all our food.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.933
Then you'll be training
on an empty stomach.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.002
And training hard.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.204
Follow me.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.974
We'll work on
your boxing skills tonight.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.876
One-armed boxing.

21:53.512 --> 21:55.280
Artemis!

21:59.017 --> 22:03.388
<i>Recognized,
Halo. B-Three-One.</i>

22:03.488 --> 22:04.723
Good morning.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.892
Ready for my
guard duty shift...

22:23.175 --> 22:24.876
Santa Prisca,

22:24.976 --> 22:26.044
here we come...

22:33.919 --> 22:36.188
<i>The unicorn
looked dreamily at Alice</i>

22:36.254 --> 22:37.823
<i>and said,</i>

22:37.889 --> 22:39.891
<i>"Talk child."</i>

22:39.991 --> 22:44.763
<i>Alice could not help her lips
curling up into a smile
as she began,</i>

22:44.863 --> 22:46.598
<i>"Do you know,
I always thought</i>

22:46.698 --> 22:49.434
<i>unicorns were
fabulous monsters, too!</i>

22:49.534 --> 22:52.037
<i>I never saw one alive before!"</i>

22:52.104 --> 22:55.607
<i>"Well, now that
we have seen each other,"</i>

22:55.707 --> 22:57.209
<i>said the unicorn,</i>

22:57.275 --> 23:00.679
<i>"if you'll believe in me,
I'll believe in you.</i>

23:01.747 --> 23:03.014
<i>Is that a bargain?"</i>

23:04.716 --> 23:06.284
<i>Lewis Carroll.</i>

23:06.385 --> 23:09.688
Through the Looking-Glass
and What Alice Found There.
