[Applause]

06:54.381 --> 07:01.720
Ladies, I expect performances
worthy of the great white way.
But then again, why it got to be

07:01.722 --> 07:06.024
white?
[Laughter]
Theater people, start your

07:06.026 --> 07:12.497
engines, and may the best
woman win.
All right, ladies, let's make

07:12.499 --> 07:13.565
some magic.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.567
My goal as a leader is to

07:15.569 --> 07:16.668
figure out how to utilize

07:16.670 --> 07:18.770
everyone in the group best.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.739
Ingenue queen penny.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.007
We're just all assuming you're

07:22.009 --> 07:22.674
penny, right?

07:22.676 --> 07:23.542
I mean, that's what--

07:23.544 --> 07:24.409
[chuckles]

07:24.411 --> 07:28.513
I'm happy to play penny.
Courtney's the obvious penny.
That's just what's gonna happen.

07:28.515 --> 07:32.484
Pageant queens, comedy queens.
I just keep thinkin' it would be
hysterical to see you play a

07:32.486 --> 07:35.387
pageant queen.
No, that's fine with me.
Trinity, does being a pageant

07:35.389 --> 07:38.557
queen or a comedy queen seem
interesting to you?
You know I don't want to be a

07:38.559 --> 07:42.394
fuck up, so I'd rather just
kind of play it safe.
You prefer to be a pageant

07:42.396 --> 07:45.263
queen?
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

07:45.265 --> 07:49.668
Trinity, she always seems
over it.
Nothing excites her.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.270
Do we want to have a
sing-through?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:52.272 --> 07:56.775
Okay.
well I'm gonna be the
greatest star and nothing

07:56.777 --> 08:06.151
and no one will keep me down
just a miracle
in front of you

08:06.153 --> 08:11.089
there's a bit of pressure
because Adore is a singer as
well.

08:11.091 --> 08:17.529
I will show you
I'll teach you
let me be your star

08:17.531 --> 08:22.434

08:22.436 --> 08:28.173
amazing singers.
Shade: The rusical has now
become the battle of the idols.

08:28.175 --> 08:31.543
When you love me

08:31.545 --> 08:35.347
I'm gonna take her down.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.782
Gia, her voice is like nails

08:37.784 --> 08:39.150
on a chalkboard.

08:39.152 --> 08:42.654
We are the comedy queens.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.623
Eeeehhh!

08:44.625 --> 08:45.657
Trinity is gettin' a little

08:45.659 --> 08:46.525
rude.

08:46.527 --> 08:47.526
Can we do it?

08:47.528 --> 08:48.660
'Cause it's a lot different.

08:48.662 --> 08:51.062
Calm down, Beyonce.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.397

<i>penny.</i>
<i>She's very Disney and I'm very</i>

<i> Okay, no, I don't wanna make</i>
<i>her a butch queen again.</i>

10:58.725 --> 11:01.693
<i>challenge, you know, this is new</i>
<i>for me too.</i>
<i>So, you know, I'ma give it my</i>

11:01.695 --> 11:07.565
<i>best and...You know.</i>
<i>I'm a drag queen.</i>
<i>I lip-synch.</i>

11:07.567 --> 11:09.401
<i>I don't sing live.</i>

11:09.403 --> 11:14.205
<i> This is really one of those</i>
<i>challenges where you have to</i>
<i>work together, and at the same</i>

11:14.207 --> 11:18.643
<i>time, stand out as the star that</i>
<i>you are.</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>

11:18.645 --> 11:22.247
<i> So get to it, ladies.</i>
<i> Thank you.</i>
<i> Thanks.</i>

11:22.249 --> 11:26.451
<i> Well, team Adore, hello.</i>
<i> All: Hello.</i>
<i> I'm so excited.</i>

11:26.453 --> 11:30.388
<i> It's gonna be a party.</i>
<i> Now Adore, what character are</i>
<i>you playing?</i>

11:30.390 --> 11:33.124
<i> I am playing bad penny.</i>
<i> Now, that's a big singing</i>
<i>role, isn't it?</i>

11:33.126 --> 11:35.560
<i> It is.</i>
<i> That's something you should</i>
<i>excel at.</i>

11:35.562 --> 11:38.663
<i> It should be cool.</i>
<i> Well, why do you doubt</i>
<i>yourself like that?</i>

11:38.665 --> 11:43.101
<i>Last week, the note for you</i>
<i>was to be prepared when you hit</i>
<i>the set.</i>

11:43.103 --> 11:44.769
<i>You have to do your homework.</i>

11:44.771 --> 11:47.172
<i> I'm pretty nervous 'cause I</i>

11:47.174 --> 11:49.307
<i>really, really want the judges</i>

11:49.309 --> 11:50.675
<i>to see that I'm not a filler</i>

11:50.677 --> 11:51.710
<i>bitch.</i>

11:51.712 --> 11:54.679
<i> So you three are the</i>
<i>showgirls.</i>
<i> Yes.</i>

11:54.681 --> 11:58.683
<i> Now, who are you playing?</i>
<i> I'm the butch queen.</i>
<i> You're a butch queen?</i>

11:58.685 --> 12:01.553
<i>Where are you gonna draw your</i>
<i>inspiration?</i>
<i> Bianca Del Rio.</i>

12:01.555 --> 12:05.590
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> Whoo!</i>
<i> Yes, ma'am!</i>

12:05.592 --> 12:10.128
<i> Way down.</i>
<i> Okay!</i>
<i> I cannot wait to see it.</i>

12:10.130 --> 12:15.500
<i>All right.</i>
<i> Gather round, thespians.</i>
<i>People, places, people.</i>

12:15.502 --> 12:22.474
<i>Tomorrow after your musical</i>
<i>debut, the dress code for the</i>
<i>main stage is Tony awards</i>

12:22.476 --> 12:28.747
<i>glamour.</i>
<i>Now, as we say in the</i>
<i>theater, darling, "break a leg</i>

12:28.749 --> 12:34.352
<i>and don't fuck it up."</i>
<i> All right.</i>

12:36.188 --> 12:37.689
<i> It's our team's turn to come</i>

12:37.691 --> 12:39.524
<i>in and rehearse with Lucian.</i>

12:39.526 --> 12:41.126
<i>I have done some musical theater</i>

12:41.128 --> 12:43.762
<i>in my past, so piece of cake.</i>

12:43.764 --> 12:44.662
<i> Hello, ladies.</i>

12:44.664 --> 12:45.530
<i> All: Hi.</i>

12:45.532 --> 12:46.564
<i> This is Denise.</i>

12:46.566 --> 12:47.432
<i> Hey.</i>

12:47.434 --> 12:48.299
<i> All: Hi.</i>

12:48.301 --> 12:49.167
<i> She's our celebrity</i>

12:49.169 --> 12:50.568
<i>choreographer and my sister.</i>

12:50.570 --> 12:51.436
<i> Oh.</i>

12:51.438 --> 12:52.337
<i> And over here, we have our</i>

12:52.339 --> 12:55.106
<i>lady j, trans icon and pianist</i>

12:55.108 --> 12:56.374
<i>to the stars.</i>

12:56.376 --> 12:57.242
<i> Hi, guys.</i>

12:57.244 --> 12:58.543
<i> All: Hi.</i>

12:58.545 --> 13:01.646
<i> Okay, so why don't you sing</i>
<i>out a little bit, okay?</i>
<i>Here we go.</i>

13:01.648 --> 13:08.787
<i>  And you and you </i>
<i> you're gonna love me </i>
<i> you're gonna love </i>

13:08.789 --> 13:13.391
<i>[high note]  me </i>
<i> okay.</i>
<i>There at the end, make sure your</i>

13:13.393 --> 13:17.395
<i>last note is the most impressive</i>
<i>one.</i>
<i>You can make it your moment, you</i>

13:17.397 --> 13:20.365
<i>know?</i>
<i> I think I'm gonna be held to</i>
<i>a higher standard on this one,</i>

13:20.367 --> 13:27.405
<i>and when you're live on stage,</i>
<i>you've got one chance.</i>
<i>Don't fuck it up.</i>

13:27.407 --> 13:30.608
<i>  We are the comedy-- </i>
<i> both:  we are the </i>
<i> comedy queens </i>

13:30.610 --> 13:34.412
<i> oh, cute.</i>
<i>  don't listen to them </i>
<i> 'cause they're all full </i>

13:34.414 --> 13:37.315
<i> of beans </i>
<i> literally.</i>
<i> Cut, cut, cut.</i>

13:37.317 --> 13:40.752
<i> When you say literally, you</i>
<i>understand what the joke is</i>
<i>there?</i>

13:40.754 --> 13:47.592
<i> Um, not really.</i>
<i> It's a fart joke.</i>
<i>It's because it smells--smells</i>

13:47.594 --> 13:54.499
<i>bad, so, uh, if you can play up</i>
<i>the comedy of it, then that will</i>
<i>sell.</i>

13:54.501 --> 13:59.637
<i>You guys right now are not</i>
<i>really funny at all.</i>
<i> Fuck.</i>

13:59.639 --> 14:02.674
<i> Okay.</i>
<i>Real quick, so pageant queens,</i>
<i>can I show you your movement</i>

14:02.676 --> 14:05.443
<i>real quick...</i>
<i> Yes, ma'am.</i>
<i> For this section? Okay.</i>

14:05.445 --> 14:09.514
<i>You're gonna step forward on the</i>
<i>left leg to strut.</i>
<i>Okay? So you have--</i>

14:09.516 --> 14:13.218
<i> I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm</i>
<i>sorry.</i>
<i>I need to know when she said...</i>

14:13.220 --> 14:17.789
<i> So it goes boom.</i>
<i> When she said "who are you--"</i>
<i>  we are the pageant queen </i>

14:17.791 --> 14:21.326
<i> does that make sense?</i>
<i> Can we do it?</i>
<i>'Cause it's a lot different when</i>

14:21.328 --> 14:24.495
<i>you're trying to--and then fall</i>
<i>back into it and make sure I'm</i>
<i>not off.</i>

14:24.497 --> 14:27.432
<i> Well, that's how we get to</i>
<i>run it so that you can try it.</i>
<i> Trinity is gettin' a little</i>

14:27.434 --> 14:28.299
<i>rude.</i>

14:28.301 --> 14:29.334
<i>It ain't Denise's fault that</i>

14:29.336 --> 14:30.535
<i>Trinity can't get the moves.</i>

14:30.537 --> 14:32.503
<i>Calm down, Beyonce.</i>

14:32.505 --> 14:38.509
<i> So...[Humming]  turn </i>

14:38.511 --> 14:46.618
<i>[background chatter]</i>

14:50.823 --> 14:54.492
<i> We're goin' down, and not in</i>
<i>a good way.</i>
<i> Sorry.</i>

14:54.494 --> 14:56.761
<i>If I suck, I suck.</i>

14:57.830 --> 15:00.765
<i>  And finally I'm the star </i>

15:00.767 --> 15:02.600
<i>  no I'm the star </i>

15:02.602 --> 15:06.204
<i>  no I'm the star </i>

15:06.206 --> 15:08.139
<i> take a second and calm down.</i>

15:08.141 --> 15:09.240
<i> Because you don't do anything</i>

15:09.242 --> 15:10.174
<i>wrong. I apologize that I open--</i>

15:10.176 --> 15:12.744
<i> I didn't say that, bitch.</i>

15:12.746 --> 15:14.112
<i> [Laughs]</i>

15:14.114 --> 15:22.387
<i> This week's challenge is to</i>

15:22.389 --> 15:26.124
<i>perform in</i> <i>shade: The rusical.</i>

15:26.126 --> 15:27.191
<i> Hello, ladies.</i>

15:27.193 --> 15:28.693
<i> All: Hi.</i>

15:28.695 --> 15:32.430
<i> All right, so let's go.</i>

15:32.432 --> 15:34.866
<i>  Just a miracle </i>

15:34.868 --> 15:39.537
<i> in front of you ohh </i>

15:39.539 --> 15:40.738
<i> why are you afraid?</i>

15:40.740 --> 15:41.606
<i>Aren't you the singer?</i>

15:41.608 --> 15:43.508
<i> Spit it out, Adore.</i>

15:43.510 --> 15:45.176
<i> It's really intimidating to</i>

15:45.178 --> 15:46.477
<i>have the person who actually</i>

15:46.479 --> 15:48.246
<i>wrote this in front of you while</i>

15:48.248 --> 15:50.181
<i>you're butchering the lyrics.</i>

15:50.183 --> 15:52.850
<i> I know that all those words,</i>
<i>it's a lot.</i>
<i>You have to get all that down</i>

15:52.852 --> 15:56.220
<i>'cause when you get lost, it</i>
<i>immediately shows in your eyes.</i>
<i> I know.</i>

15:56.222 --> 15:58.690
<i> You look absolutely</i>
<i>terrified.</i>
<i> This is the chance basically</i>

15:58.692 --> 16:04.762
<i>for me to prove myself.</i>
<i>I've got to get it together.</i>
<i>  and finally I'm the star </i>

16:04.764 --> 16:10.401
<i>  no I'm the star </i>
<i> [Deep voice]  no I'm </i>
<i> the star </i>

16:10.403 --> 16:14.238
<i>[chuckles]</i>
<i> You have a very unique tone</i>
<i>to your voice.</i>

16:14.240 --> 16:15.606
<i> I've been told that.</i>

16:15.608 --> 16:16.641
<i>I like to think that I have a</i>

16:16.643 --> 16:18.242
<i>rather distinctive voice.</i>

16:18.244 --> 16:23.414
<i>[Laughs]</i>
<i>I've embraced it.</i>
<i> Two, three, four...</i>

16:23.416 --> 16:27.452
<i>  Well I'm not gonna stick </i>
<i> around and be a part </i>
<i> of her show </i>

16:27.454 --> 16:32.323
<i> okay, stop for one second.</i>
<i>That sort of rhythmic</i>
<i>talk-singing that you're doing</i>

16:32.325 --> 16:35.426
<i>right now is not coming off that</i>
<i>great.</i>

16:35.428 --> 16:36.861
<i></i> <i>Ay, dios mio.</i>

16:36.863 --> 16:44.202
<i> All:  center stage </i>
<i>  and finally </i>
<i>[Off-key]  I'm the star </i>

16:44.204 --> 16:47.672
<i> April, you don't have to</i>
<i>necessarily scream it out like</i>
<i>that.</i>

16:47.674 --> 16:53.644
<i>  And finally I'm the star </i>
<i> well, you just went up again.</i>
<i> I need to prove that I can</i>

16:53.646 --> 17:00.551
<i>pull this for me and for my</i>
<i>team, so I can't be a downward</i>
<i>Debbie.</i>

17:00.553 --> 17:06.357
<i>I don't know what her name is.</i>
<i> Showgirls, your act is going</i>
<i>to be the sink-or-swim thing of</i>

17:06.359 --> 17:12.263
<i>this whole team.</i>
<i> This is a huge challenge.</i>
<i>Like one person's off, we all</i>

17:12.265 --> 17:15.333
<i>fall like dominoes.</i>

17:15.335 --> 17:17.835
<i> Trinity is definitely not</i>

17:17.837 --> 17:19.670
<i>100% here.</i>

17:19.672 --> 17:22.073
<i>Is she frustrated sexually?</i>

17:22.075 --> 17:24.675
<i>I have no idea, but guess what?</i>

17:24.677 --> 17:26.677
<i>We have about this much time and</i>

17:26.679 --> 17:28.646
<i>about this much work to do, so</i>

17:28.648 --> 17:30.214
<i>bitch, get into it.</i>

17:30.216 --> 17:36.087
<i> All right, from the top.</i>
<i> Turn around.</i>
<i> No, you're coming with me</i>

17:36.089 --> 17:39.257
<i>missy.</i>
<i> Boom.</i>
<i> I'm you.</i>

17:39.259 --> 17:42.560
<i>Do you the difficultness in</i>
<i>doing it backwards and then</i>
<i>trying to turn around at the</i>

17:42.562 --> 17:45.630
<i>same time?</i>
<i>It's really, really fast.</i>
<i> She has to be here--</i>

17:45.632 --> 17:48.499
<i> it took you too long to move.</i>
<i>I'm telling you.</i>
<i>You're supposed to hit it.</i>

17:48.501 --> 17:51.702
<i>You have to try to--</i>
<i> considering this has been</i>
<i>your problem area, take a second</i>

17:51.704 --> 17:57.408
<i>and calm down.</i>
<i>I walk to her, and I say "turn</i>
<i>around."</i>

17:57.410 --> 18:00.878
<i>I would suggest you figure out</i>
<i>what you need to do prior to</i>
<i>telling me what I'm not doing</i>

18:00.880 --> 18:03.648
<i>right.</i>
<i> You're absolutely right,</i>
<i>Bianca, because you don't do</i>

18:03.650 --> 18:06.250
<i>anything wrong.</i>
<i>I apologize that I...</i>
<i> I didn't say that, bitch.</i>

18:06.252 --> 18:12.090
<i> Opened my mouth, and that's</i>
<i>why I don't say anything in the</i>
<i>first place.</i>

18:12.092 --> 18:13.324
<i>  Cover girl </i>

18:13.326 --> 18:14.625
<i> all:  put that bass </i>

18:14.627 --> 18:15.493
<i> in your walk </i>

18:15.495 --> 18:16.494
<i> come on!</i>

18:16.496 --> 18:17.495
<i> Come on, girl.</i>

18:17.497 --> 18:19.063
<i> Today on the main stage, our</i>

18:19.065 --> 18:20.298
<i>runway look is Tony awards</i>

18:20.300 --> 18:22.166
<i>glamour, and we're performing in</i>

18:22.168 --> 18:23.634
<i>shade: The rusical.</i>

18:23.636 --> 18:28.639
<i>We have to sing lots, although</i>
<i>you've seen some of the people</i>
<i>in my group.</i>

18:28.641 --> 18:32.110
<i> You ready to serve some</i>
<i>pageant realness out there?</i>
<i> Yes, God, bitch, ugh.</i>

18:32.112 --> 18:34.579
<i> Okay?</i>
<i> I'm gonna get me a Tony</i>
<i>tonight.</i>

18:34.581 --> 18:37.748
<i> What's a Tony?</i>
<i>[Record scratch]</i>

18:37.750 --> 18:44.522
<i> So you were on the idol of</i>
<i>the American.</i>
<i> Yes.</i>

18:44.524 --> 18:47.525
<i>And you were on the</i>
<i>idol of the Australian.</i>
<i> I was.</i>

18:47.527 --> 18:52.230
<i>I went along the first day and,</i>
<i>um--as a boy--and I got knocked</i>
<i>back.</i>

18:52.232 --> 18:55.700
<i>And so then I went back the next</i>
<i>day in drag, and I made it</i>
<i>through to the finals.</i>

18:55.702 --> 19:00.104
<i> Holy crap.</i>
<i> I was the first out gay</i>
<i>person and the first person in</i>

19:00.106 --> 19:04.609
<i>drag to be on any</i> <i>idol</i> franchise
anywhere in the world.
I wish I could've did that.

19:04.611 --> 19:08.312
Yeah, but Adore, don't you
feel like you were sort of the
American counterpart of, like,

19:08.314 --> 19:13.484
the first real sort of gay
person on <i>American idol?</i>
<i> Um, yeah, but I was kind of</i>

19:13.486 --> 19:17.155
<i>advised to just not be so out</i>
<i>there.</i>
<i> So you actually had to, like,</i>

19:17.157 --> 19:19.557
<i>kind of keep yourself--</i>
<i> tone it down a little.</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>

19:19.559 --> 19:22.493
<i> Right.</i>
<i> Some people weren't liking</i>
<i>it.</i>

19:22.495 --> 19:30.334
<i> My mom told me to butch it up</i>
<i>because she didn't want them</i>
<i>making fun of me.</i>

19:30.336 --> 19:38.442
<i>She should've just let me go out</i>
<i>there with pink hair.</i>
<i>That would've been cool.</i>

19:38.444 --> 19:41.913
<i> Gia, what were some of your</i>
<i>talents as a child besides</i>
<i>tucking your weenie in the</i>

19:41.915 --> 19:44.916
<i>middle of the night?</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> I actually was doing the</i>

19:44.918 --> 19:51.189
<i>dance form of kabuki theater</i>
<i>since I was five years old.</i>
<i>In Japan, kabuki theater is all</i>

19:51.191 --> 19:55.426
<i>men, but we wouldn't, like, get</i>
<i>tucked and, like, put boobs on</i>
<i>and stuff like that.</i>

19:55.428 --> 20:00.565
<i>In my culture, it's not a gay</i>
<i>thing, so even straight men do</i>
<i>it.</i>

20:00.567 --> 20:03.401
<i>It's an art.</i>
<i>This is like when I would do,</i>
<i>like, the boy roles.</i>

20:03.403 --> 20:06.437
<i>And this is one I would do the</i>
<i>fish role.</i>
<i> No way!</i>

20:06.439 --> 20:11.242
<i> Looking good.</i>
<i> With my theater background in</i>
<i>kabuki, I definitely have a good</i>

20:11.244 --> 20:17.715
<i>sense of stage presence and the</i>
<i>choreography, but at the same</i>
<i>time, I'm really hoping for the</i>

20:17.717 --> 20:21.752
<i>best, 'cause some of us ain't</i>
<i>singers.</i>
<i>We dancers.</i>

20:21.754 --> 20:23.354
<i> Ow!</i>

20:23.356 --> 20:39.637
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> cover girl </i>
<i> put the bass in your walk </i>

20:39.639 --> 20:45.576
<i> head to toe </i>
<i> let your whole body talk </i>
<i>and what?</i>

20:45.578 --> 20:46.544
<i>[Applause]</i>

<i> Welcome to the main stage of</i>

21:17.343 --> 21:18.676
<i> I'll be the judge of that.</i>

21:18.678 --> 21:20.144
<i>[Laughs]</i>

21:20.146 --> 21:22.713
<i>And the legendary star of stage</i>

21:22.715 --> 21:25.416
<i>and screen, the o.G. Dream girl,</i>

21:27.186 --> 21:29.353
<i> Darling, look at you.</i>

21:29.355 --> 21:30.721
<i>I love everything about you.</i>

21:30.723 --> 21:32.690
<i> I am so excited to have you</i>

21:32.692 --> 21:33.557

21:33.559 --> 21:38.763
<i>This week, we challenged our</i>
<i>leading ladies to tread the</i>
<i>boards in a musical comedy</i>

21:38.765 --> 21:43.801
<i>extravaganza,</i> <i>shade: The</i>
<i>rusical.</i>
<i>Now they're ready to make their</i>

21:43.803 --> 21:50.274
<i>off-off-off-off-off-off</i>
<i>Broadway debut.</i>
<i>Gentlemen, start your engines.</i>

21:50.276 --> 21:54.278
<i>And may the best woman win.</i>

21:54.280 --> 21:55.680
<i> You got a little lost.</i>

21:55.682 --> 21:57.348
<i> You were way off.</i>

21:57.350 --> 21:58.883
<i> It's like you have a beard on</i>

21:58.885 --> 22:00.851
<i>your forehead.</i>

22:00.853 --> 22:02.920
<i> [Laughs]</i>

22:08.260 --> 22:15.333
<i> Act one,</i> <i>shade: The rusical.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>
<i> In the city of drag queens,</i>

22:15.335 --> 22:20.771
<i>there's a fine line between</i>
<i>being shady, and being a lady.</i>
<i>This is penny.</i>

22:20.773 --> 22:29.947
<i>Which will she choose?</i>
<i>  I just got off the bus </i>
<i> I don't drink or eat or cuss </i>

22:29.949 --> 22:35.486
<i>  you're new in town </i>
<i>  it's time to knuckle down </i>
<i> both:  start swimming to </i>

22:35.488 --> 22:40.825
<i> the top before you drown </i>
<i> who are you?</i>
<i> Both:  we are the </i>

22:40.827 --> 22:45.129
<i> pageant queens </i>
<i> oh, fancy!</i>
<i> Both:  we're elegant </i>

22:45.131 --> 22:50.801
<i> machines </i>
<i> in gowns we strut </i>
<i> we don't need corny smut </i>

22:50.803 --> 22:54.472
<i> both: What?</i>
<i>  let's hold back and </i>
<i> see which way she leans </i>

22:54.474 --> 22:58.476
<i> who are you?</i>
<i> Both:  we are the </i>
<i> comedy queens </i>

22:58.478 --> 23:04.548
<i> oh, cute.</i>
<i>  humor always </i>
<i> justifies the means </i>

23:04.550 --> 23:07.485
<i>  while she's there telling </i>
<i> a joke </i>
<i> ugh!</i>

23:07.487 --> 23:10.287
<i>  I'm right behind you </i>
<i> poke </i>
<i> oh!</i>

23:10.289 --> 23:13.357
<i> Both:  don't listen to </i>
<i> them 'cause they're all </i>
<i> full of beans </i>

23:13.359 --> 23:15.860
<i> literally.</i>
<i> Who's that?</i>
<i> Wait!</i>

23:15.862 --> 23:19.497
<i> She's the shady queen </i>
<i> horrid queen </i>
<i> no one wants to see her </i>

23:19.499 --> 23:23.401
<i>  on her own, all alone </i>
<i> no one wants to be her </i>
<i>  listen up, pretty pup </i>

23:23.403 --> 23:26.871
<i>  she's on her way </i>
<i> to six feet </i>
<i> both:  underground </i>

23:26.873 --> 23:30.374
<i>  yes and nothing nice </i>
<i> nothing good ever </i>
<i> goes her way so </i>

23:30.376 --> 23:32.910

<i> [All gasp] RuPaul!</i>
<i> Oh.</i>

<i> All: No!</i>
<i> Don't do it.</i>
<i> Don't go.</i>

<i> She's a man with one eye!</i>
<i>  there's a hole </i>
<i> in your heart </i>

24:01.274 --> 24:06.911
<i> there's a place in your soul </i>
<i> a passion so strong </i>
<i> it makes your blood boil </i>

24:06.913 --> 24:12.917
<i> all your dreams come alive </i>
<i> all your wishes will grow </i>
<i> if you take a swig </i>

<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>  d'you see </i>
<i> what she said to me </i>

26:04.163 --> 26:07.498
<i> back roles.</i>
<i> Heard it.</i>

<i> Girl, the paycheck.</i>
<i> Oh, right.</i>
<i> Both: Mm-hmm.</i>

<i> oh no no no no no </i>
<i> I'll never love anyone else </i>
<i></i> <i>ay, dios mio!</i>

26:38.631 --> 26:43.634
<i>She's going down!</i>
<i>Too much fish oil!</i>
<i> Now's our chance!</i>

26:43.636 --> 26:47.805
<i> All:  watch us rise </i>
<i> to the top 'cause we're the </i>
<i> fresh fish on the scene </i>

26:47.807 --> 26:52.242

<i>[Overlapping arguing]</i>

<i> Oh, the shade!</i>
<i>The shade of it all!</i>
<i> look at yourself </i>

27:27.179 --> 27:33.150
<i> shady ladies </i>
<i> you should be ashamed </i>
<i> [Laughter]</i>

27:33.152 --> 27:40.824
<i>  Of what you've become </i>
<i> oh, I never thought </i>
<i> that you would do this </i>

27:40.826 --> 27:49.166
<i> so let me remind you </i>
<i> of just one thing </i>
<i> take each other's hands </i>

27:49.168 --> 27:57.841
<i> and come together </i>
<i> 'cause we are each other's </i>
<i> family </i>

27:57.843 --> 28:15.359
<i> all 2,603,040 sisters </i>
<i> this is our land </i>

<i> Both: Or a comedy queen...</i>
<i> Both: A fishy queen...</i>

28:44.657 --> 28:53.897
<i> A shady queen...</i>
<i> All: Or just a big damn girl.</i>
<i> We are a family.</i>

28:53.899 --> 29:02.339
<i> That rules </i>
<i>[Laughter and applause]</i>
<i> brava!</i>

29:02.341 --> 29:06.777

<i>Uh-oh, now sissy that walk.</i>
<i>Welcome, ladies.</i>
<i>This week, you competed in</i>

29:51.924 --> 29:59.730

<i>Gia Gunn,</i>

30:07.273 --> 30:20.617
<i>Joslyn Fox...</i>
<i>You are all safe.</i>
<i>You may leave the stage.</i>

30:20.619 --> 30:28.892
<i>Ladies, you represent the best</i>
<i>and the worst of the week.</i>
<i>It's time for the judges'</i>

30:28.894 --> 30:34.398
<i>reviews...Starting with Trinity</i>
<i>k. Bonet.</i>

30:34.400 --> 30:35.699
<i> You look beautiful tonight.</i>

30:35.701 --> 30:36.800
<i>I like the way the gown</i>

30:36.802 --> 30:38.936
<i>accentuates your hipline.</i>

30:38.938 --> 30:40.637
<i> I did like your character in</i>

30:40.639 --> 30:42.506
<i>the musical, but I'm not able to</i>

30:42.508 --> 30:43.874
<i>understand you.</i>

30:43.876 --> 30:46.944
<i>It's kind of a mush mouth thing.</i>

30:46.946 --> 30:50.914
<i>We heard Bianca, and then we'd</i>
<i>lose your line.</i>
<i> It's all a learning</i>

30:50.916 --> 30:54.251
<i>experience.</i>
<i> Yes, yes, but you are in the</i>
<i>Olympics of drag.</i>

30:54.253 --> 30:59.990
<i> But every star was crap</i>
<i>before they became the shit.</i>
<i> Let me tell you something.</i>

30:59.992 --> 31:02.492
<i>Put a cork in it.</i>

31:02.494 --> 31:06.864
<i>Literally.</i>
<i>Get a cork, put it in your</i>
<i>mouth.</i>

31:06.866 --> 31:11.168
<i>Speak with that cork in the</i>
<i>mouth.</i>
<i>It will do wonders for</i>

31:11.170 --> 31:17.941
<i>enunciation.</i>
<i> Next up, Darienne Lake.</i>
<i> Look at you all pretty in</i>

31:17.943 --> 31:22.679
<i>your pond scum green.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i>Oh, thank you very much.</i>

31:22.681 --> 31:29.786
<i> As far as your comedy queen</i>
<i>goes, you got a little lost.</i>
<i> It is a little hard to kind</i>

31:29.788 --> 31:34.291
<i>of continue on with a fire siren</i>
<i>being squashed in your ear.</i>

31:34.293 --> 31:35.325
<i> That's Gia you're talking</i>

31:35.327 --> 31:36.226
<i>about, right?</i>

31:36.228 --> 31:39.363
<i> Uh, yeah, yeah.</i>
<i> Well, what you think she's</i>
<i>safe and you're here?</i>

31:39.365 --> 31:42.866
<i> 'Cause I think I'm one of the</i>
<i>top three?</i>
<i>[Laughs]</i>

31:42.868 --> 31:48.238
<i> All right, moving on.</i>
<i> Ben de LA creme.</i>
<i> Let's talk about the way you</i>

31:48.240 --> 31:51.842
<i>look.</i>
<i>I believe that less is always</i>
<i>best.</i>

31:51.844 --> 31:55.846
<i>Look in the mirror, take a</i>
<i>little bit of something away.</i>
<i> Oh!</i>

31:55.848 --> 31:59.416
<i> That's what I'm talking</i>
<i>about!</i>
<i>Now you are workin' it.</i>

31:59.418 --> 32:03.687
<i> I did like your character in</i>
<i>the musical, but I felt that you</i>
<i>could've taken it further.</i>

32:03.689 --> 32:09.259
<i> I loved your portrayal of the</i>
<i>villain, loved your evil bettie</i>
<i>page look, and your voice too.</i>

32:09.261 --> 32:14.531
<i> Thank you so much.</i>
<i> Up next, Courtney Act.</i>
<i> The illusion is workin' for</i>

32:14.533 --> 32:17.768
<i>me.</i>
<i> [Chuckles]</i>
<i> A-ma-zing.</i>

32:17.770 --> 32:23.607
<i>And you can really sing.</i>
<i>[Shrilly] fabulous.</i>
<i> You are a star.</i>

32:23.609 --> 32:27.411
<i> Thank you.</i>
<i> But I was actually really</i>
<i>nervous in rehearsals because</i>

32:27.413 --> 32:35.886
<i>you were missing cues.</i>
<i> I was muffling two words, but</i>
<i>i nailed it on the night.</i>

32:35.888 --> 32:41.325
<i> Next up, Adore Delano.</i>
<i> Tonight, the dress for me</i>
<i>could be longer.</i>

32:41.327 --> 32:46.496
<i>It could go to the floor.</i>
<i> Why is your waist not cinched</i>
<i>when I just talked to you about</i>

32:46.498 --> 32:49.533
<i>this?</i>
<i> Because I don't have, like, a</i>
<i>"cincher" cincher, only a--</i>

32:49.535 --> 32:54.604
<i> borrow a waist cincher and</i>
<i>give me the silhouette I need</i>
<i>from you, Adore Delano.</i>

32:54.606 --> 32:58.508
<i> I'm a better drag queen than</i>
<i>I'm coming off, I swear.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>

32:58.510 --> 33:03.580
<i> I loved your voice.</i>
<i>I thought that you could compete</i>
<i>in</i> <i>American idol.</i>

33:03.582 --> 33:06.450
<i> I did.</i>
<i> See that?</i>
<i>I got that immediately.</i>

33:06.452 --> 33:10.187
<i> Party.</i>
<i> Ha! Party.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

33:10.189 --> 33:16.226
<i> Next up April carrion.</i>
<i> Well, your face is always</i>
<i>beat for the gods, but I think</i>

33:16.228 --> 33:20.297
<i>you're shading's a little dark</i>
<i>towards your hairline.</i>
<i> It's like you have a beard on</i>

33:20.299 --> 33:25.669
<i>your forehead.</i>
<i> April, I know you tried</i>
<i>really, really hard on this</i>

33:25.671 --> 33:32.442
<i>challenge, but you were way off.</i>
<i> Being the big girl, it's not</i>
<i>just about size.</i>

33:32.444 --> 33:37.881
<i>It's more of an attitude, and</i>
<i>you didn't deliver the attitude.</i>
<i>You put some padding in and</i>

33:37.883 --> 33:42.552
<i>thought that it would translate,</i>
<i>and it didn't.</i>
<i> Thank you, ladies.</i>

33:42.554 --> 33:48.725
<i>While you untuck in the forum</i>
<i>decor lounge, the judges and I</i>
<i>will deliberate.</i>

33:48.727 --> 33:51.862
<i>All right, now just between us</i>
<i>dream girls...</i>
<i> Mm.</i>

33:51.864 --> 33:56.967
<i> Let's talk off-Broadway.</i>
<i>Let's start with Trinity k.</i>
<i>Bonet.</i>

33:56.969 --> 33:59.703
<i> Diction, diction.</i>
<i>I want to know what you're</i>
<i>saying!</i>

33:59.705 --> 34:03.907
<i> Now when Trinity's in drag,</i>
<i>she wears temporary teeth.</i>
<i>We call 'em flippers in the</i>

34:03.909 --> 34:08.612
<i>business.</i>
<i>I'm wondering could that be the</i>
<i>reason she's unable to pronounce</i>

34:08.614 --> 34:13.183
<i>her lyrics?</i>
<i> Flipper or no flipper, you've</i>
<i>got to work with what you've</i>

34:13.185 --> 34:15.585
<i>got.</i>
<i> That's true.</i>
<i> Yes.</i>

34:15.587 --> 34:18.822
<i> And be open to listening to</i>
<i>somebody.</i>
<i>You don't have to get all</i>

34:18.824 --> 34:24.161
<i>ugh face.</i>
<i>Ain't nobody got time for that.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

34:24.163 --> 34:29.833
<i> Darienne Lake.</i>
<i> She seemed to get a little</i>
<i>bit lost in the sauce whereas</i>

34:29.835 --> 34:36.740
<i>Gia, foghorn or not, was giving</i>
<i>it all with ease.</i>
<i>Darienne disappeared from me.</i>

34:36.742 --> 34:40.777
<i> The thunder from down under,</i>
<i>Courtney Act.</i>
<i> I instantly was transported</i>

34:40.779 --> 34:44.281
<i>into a Broadway house.</i>
<i> Yes.</i>
<i> And I totally bought it from</i>

34:44.283 --> 34:49.219
<i>head to toe, but there were some</i>
<i>clunkers that she hit.</i>
<i> I didn't really mind any of</i>

34:49.221 --> 34:52.656
<i>the notes that might've been a</i>
<i>little off.</i>
<i>She really nailed this</i>

34:52.658 --> 34:56.960
<i>performance.</i>
<i> I loved that fresh from</i>
<i>Kansas, fresh-off-the-bus look</i>

34:56.962 --> 35:00.363
<i>of hers.</i>
<i>She was [Shrilly] fabulous.</i>
<i> Ben de LA creme.</i>

35:00.365 --> 35:04.701
<i> Knew the choreography, knew</i>
<i>all the words, looked good doing</i>
<i>it.</i>

35:04.703 --> 35:08.238
<i> I really love her body</i>
<i>language as well.</i>
<i> You can tell by lookin' at</i>

35:08.240 --> 35:11.274
<i>her, this is her shtick.</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i> But she only took it halfway</i>

35:11.276 --> 35:13.777
<i>to Toni Braxton.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> She didn't take it all the</i>

35:13.779 --> 35:17.214
<i>way.</i>
<i> Adore Delano.</i>
<i> Adore has a beautiful voice,</i>

35:17.216 --> 35:24.287
<i>but she can be a little sloppy.</i>
<i> Adore was the mvp for me.</i>
<i>Her voice and the tones that</i>

35:24.289 --> 35:28.692
<i>were coming out of her mouth</i>
<i>made me look at her in a whole</i>
<i>'nother light of being like,</i>

35:28.694 --> 35:33.730
<i>"wow, this is a real talent."</i>
<i> Last but not least, April</i>
<i>carrion.</i>

35:33.732 --> 35:38.668
<i> She's beautiful, and she</i>
<i>tried really hard.</i>
<i>Unfortunately, she did not</i>

35:38.670 --> 35:42.572
<i>embody the big girl role.</i>
<i> Well, that's--that's the</i>
<i>standout role of that trio.</i>

35:42.574 --> 35:46.910
<i> Yes, it is.</i>
<i> And it has to deliver.</i>
<i>That was the problem.</i>

35:46.912 --> 35:51.515
<i> Silence.</i>
<i>I've made my decision, guys and</i>
<i>dolls.</i>

35:51.517 --> 35:54.885
