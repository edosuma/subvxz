WEBVTT

00:01.130 --> 00:03.195
Sometimes my highly tuned
Spider-Sense

00:03.233 --> 00:04.707
tells me there's trouble.

00:04.856 --> 00:07.215
And sometimes I just hear
a really loud alarm.

00:09.459 --> 00:12.152
Don't worry, folks.
Gonna check on that pesky noise

00:12.210 --> 00:14.941
so you can get back to your
fancy ribbon-cutting ceremony.

00:16.402 --> 00:20.465
Whoa. That's a seriously
big hole. Okay, Spidey.

00:21.424 --> 00:24.356
Looks like you're about
to take on a whole army of...

00:24.668 --> 00:26.949
one bald guy?

00:28.035 --> 00:30.090
You do all
this damage yourself, shiny?

00:30.262 --> 00:33.043
Yeah. Pretty impressive,
huh?

00:33.621 --> 00:35.137
It doesn't add up.

00:35.309 --> 00:36.699
You're a big guy,
but that wall

00:36.757 --> 00:38.959
looks like it was hit by
a wrecking ball.

00:39.301 --> 00:42.129
And there it is.
Man, can I call 'em or what?

00:42.277 --> 00:43.910
I should have
my own detective show.

00:44.105 --> 00:46.871
People call me
the Absorbing Man.

00:47.191 --> 00:48.707
'Cause you have
paper towel powers?

00:48.785 --> 00:52.191
Because
I can absorb anything.

00:55.184 --> 00:57.777
Right.
Just like paper towels can.

00:57.879 --> 01:00.512
You sure you don't wanna go with
"Paper Towel Man"?

01:00.570 --> 01:03.504
I promise you no other bad guys
are using that name.

01:09.137 --> 01:13.152
Insult me all you want.
I have thick skin.

01:13.457 --> 01:15.035
Or, better yet,

01:16.223 --> 01:17.828
sharp skin.

01:18.332 --> 01:19.754
Uh-oh.

01:27.680 --> 01:30.461
Talk about being stuck
between a rock and a hard face!

Hmm? Now, what
do we have here?

Your vacation photos?

02:07.732 --> 02:10.130
Hey, gang!
Screwball here!

02:10.211 --> 02:11.213
Screwball?

02:11.271 --> 02:12.740
With another fun fact.

02:12.798 --> 02:14.661
It's hard for a CEO
to cut the ribbon

02:14.719 --> 02:16.810
on his polluting
power plant headquarters

02:16.868 --> 02:18.904
if he doesn't
have the ribbon!

02:19.163 --> 02:21.615
Let this be a lesson
to all you corporate shills.

02:21.712 --> 02:23.966
You never know when
you'll be surprised by...

02:25.654 --> 02:26.658
Spider-Man?

02:27.106 --> 02:28.341
Mmm.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.640
Metal.

02:33.372 --> 02:35.747
You might want to look
both ways next time.

02:35.813 --> 02:38.490
And you might not wanna
stand there this time.

02:39.115 --> 02:40.497
Sorry, Spider-Man.

02:40.570 --> 02:43.146
I expected those business goons
to chase me.

02:46.458 --> 02:47.521
Great.

02:47.587 --> 02:50.869
Smile, Spider-Man.
<i>You've been screwballed.</i>

02:52.270 --> 02:55.621
Pete, you have got to watch
the new Screwball video.

02:55.712 --> 02:58.713
Not right now, Harry.
I'm working on something.

03:01.050 --> 03:02.441
Pretty heavy security

03:02.499 --> 03:04.340
for vacation photos.

03:05.149 --> 03:08.278
Check it out. She totally
messes with Spider-Man.

03:08.336 --> 03:10.707
- It's hilarious.
- Is it?

03:10.765 --> 03:13.840
'Cause thanks to this Screwball
character, Spider-Man lost a bad guy.

03:14.097 --> 03:17.590
Oh, please! Spider-Man needs
to be taken down a peg.

03:17.701 --> 03:19.957
This Screwball's my new hero.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.074
She's not a hero, Harry.

03:22.132 --> 03:24.489
Heroes have power
and responsibility.

03:24.547 --> 03:25.746
Screwball doesn't
have either.

03:25.804 --> 03:27.645
Oh, she has power,
all right.

03:27.703 --> 03:29.824
The power of the Internet.

03:29.951 --> 03:31.668
This video's
only been up a few hours,

03:31.726 --> 03:34.598
and it already has
hundreds of thousands of views.

03:34.685 --> 03:36.395
Views aren't power.

03:36.453 --> 03:38.348
- They're not?
- Look around.

03:38.543 --> 03:40.864
- <i>You've been Screwballed!</i>
- Must be a slow news day.

03:40.926 --> 03:42.012
Come on!

03:42.070 --> 03:44.348
- What's so funny?
- Oh, hey, Liz.

03:44.645 --> 03:47.156
Just watching Screwball's latest post.
Have you seen it?

03:47.223 --> 03:50.895
Uh, no, not yet. What are people saying?
Do they like it?

03:50.962 --> 03:54.265
Oh, yeah. It's by far her best.
It has Spider-Man in it.

03:54.332 --> 03:56.692
And that's the only reason
people care about it.

03:56.793 --> 04:00.176
People care because Screwball takes
on corruption with cool pranks,

04:00.272 --> 04:02.876
not because
it has Spider-Man in it.

04:03.040 --> 04:07.943
Really? Then why does this video have four
times as many views as all her others?

04:08.106 --> 04:09.262
It does?

04:10.080 --> 04:14.090
Well, if involving Spider-Man
brings more attention to my causes,

04:14.801 --> 04:18.543
then Spider-Man is exactly
what my viewers are gonna get.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.421
Hey, guys.
Welcome to Screwball's

04:22.479 --> 04:24.291
brand-new Spidey segment.

04:24.349 --> 04:27.424
At least once a week, I'll be
making a video about Spider-Man.

04:27.482 --> 04:29.533
So sound off in the
comments, and let me know

04:29.591 --> 04:31.002
what you think
of the old webhead.

04:31.060 --> 04:34.236
- <i>You've been Screwballed!</i>
- Agh!

04:34.963 --> 04:37.557
Where is it?
Where's what?

04:37.697 --> 04:40.268
I told you to grab
everything in the safe.

04:40.486 --> 04:42.541
And I did.

04:43.220 --> 04:46.268
I don't care about diamonds.
I wanted the flash drive!

04:46.432 --> 04:49.736
Oh, that.
Spider-Man got it.

04:49.807 --> 04:51.604
You imbecile.

04:51.843 --> 04:53.572
That store is a front
for The Owl,

04:53.715 --> 04:57.682
who was blackmailing me with
the information on that drive!

04:57.796 --> 05:00.143
Why didn't you
tell me all this?

05:00.525 --> 05:02.514
Because I wanted
to keep it simple enough

05:02.572 --> 05:04.635
to absorb through
your thick skull!

05:04.771 --> 05:08.105
The only reason I hired you was
so he wouldn't trace it to me!

05:08.329 --> 05:10.525
And stop eating my chips!

05:10.669 --> 05:12.337
I'm not!

05:14.697 --> 05:15.893
Busted.

05:16.291 --> 05:19.400
That drive has enough dirt on it
to put me away forever,

05:19.549 --> 05:22.119
and now Spider-Man has it.

05:22.186 --> 05:24.736
You get it back,
and keep my name out of it,

05:24.845 --> 05:27.830
or so help me... Ow!

05:28.502 --> 05:29.806
There won't be
enough of you left

05:29.864 --> 05:31.611
to scoop up salsa!

05:33.291 --> 05:35.377
That's not funny.

05:36.121 --> 05:38.861
<i>Spider-Man should leave the
crime-fighting to the police...</i>

05:38.970 --> 05:43.142
<i>but keep being part
of those hilarious videos.</i>

05:43.697 --> 05:47.077
<i>Leave Spider-Man alone.
Spider-Man rules!</i>

05:47.144 --> 05:50.517
<i>Which is also the name
of my Spider-Man fan page.</i>

05:51.009 --> 05:52.564
<i>Spider-Man's a menace.</i>

05:52.622 --> 05:54.009
<i>I had to look that word up.</i>

05:54.118 --> 05:56.509
<i>But once I did, I agreed.</i>

05:56.586 --> 05:57.791
<i>A menace!</i>

05:57.959 --> 06:00.244
- <i>What are you doing?
- Gotta go.</i>

06:01.549 --> 06:02.884
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey, Randy.

06:02.942 --> 06:04.654
Can we move
our study group to...

06:04.712 --> 06:06.233
Oh, come on!

06:06.336 --> 06:08.523
Don't tell me you're
a Screwball fan too.

06:08.593 --> 06:10.959
Why wouldn't I be?
She's great.

06:11.154 --> 06:13.647
She's everything that's wrong
with the Internet.

06:13.705 --> 06:15.506
If she really wanted
to make a difference,

06:15.564 --> 06:17.238
she'd do something legitimate.

06:17.296 --> 06:19.670
- Like your boring blog?
- Exactly!

06:19.728 --> 06:22.756
I mean...
It's not boring.

06:23.115 --> 06:25.795
In fact, you know that power
company she pranked last week?

06:25.856 --> 06:28.464
It was one of a dozen businesses
bought up on the same day

06:28.522 --> 06:30.506
by the same
anonymous corporation.

06:30.592 --> 06:33.686
I haven't cracked who it is yet,
but my gut tells me the Mob's behind it.

06:33.749 --> 06:35.510
They have...
You know what?

06:35.568 --> 06:37.795
I'll just send you my story.
It's only 35 pages.

06:37.865 --> 06:40.097
I'm good, thanks.
I just think you're jealous

06:40.164 --> 06:43.865
because Screwball gets a ton of hits,
and your blog only has... three.

06:44.041 --> 06:47.803
So what? Screwball's
numbers are down too.

06:48.076 --> 06:50.725
Without new footage of
Spider-Man, she's nothing.

06:51.029 --> 06:54.248
Hey, finding Spider-Man is hard.
Probably.

06:54.412 --> 06:56.037
Oh, I have to go.

06:56.147 --> 06:58.248
My dad's speaking
a the groundbreaking ceremony

06:58.381 --> 07:00.149
for the city's
New Media building today.

07:00.216 --> 07:02.315
Now, he's a real journalist.

07:02.373 --> 07:05.475
In fact, every major
news outlet's gonna be there,

07:05.561 --> 07:09.092
including my blog,
thank you very much.

07:09.170 --> 07:12.061
Every major outlet, huh?

07:24.875 --> 07:26.998
Thanks for coming out
to support my dad, guys.

07:27.100 --> 07:29.011
I didn't even know
you knew about this event.

07:29.078 --> 07:31.834
Oh, thi...
Of course we did.

07:32.021 --> 07:33.748
And it has nothing to do
with the fact that

07:33.806 --> 07:35.425
we were across the street
having lunch.

07:35.483 --> 07:37.459
Don't let him fool you,
Randy.

07:37.517 --> 07:39.131
It's just nice to do something

07:39.189 --> 07:41.600
that doesn't involve
our competing schools for a change.

07:41.725 --> 07:46.022
Well, technically, my dad is
lending them an Oscorp worker bot.

07:47.350 --> 07:48.608
I should've known.

07:48.795 --> 07:51.897
Well, maybe you can use a Horizon
High pen to write the story.

07:52.134 --> 07:54.865
Thank you, everyone.

07:55.428 --> 07:58.701
Before we break ground,
I'd like to say a few words,

07:58.818 --> 08:00.795
and though my editor
won't believe me,

08:00.943 --> 08:03.154
I promise
it'll only be a few.

08:03.303 --> 08:04.331
People always ask

08:04.389 --> 08:07.225
if I have any advice
for the next generation.

08:07.396 --> 08:09.631
If I do, it's this:

08:09.824 --> 08:11.748
value your story.

08:12.318 --> 08:15.991
Nowadays, anyone anywhere can
have an audience of millions.

08:16.568 --> 08:20.931
But being seen by those people
isn't the same as reaching them.

08:21.037 --> 08:23.901
A real writer doesn't care
about getting likes,

08:24.029 --> 08:25.934
they care about
making a difference,

08:26.068 --> 08:29.842
whether it's for 100,000 people
or just one.

08:30.029 --> 08:32.701
And now,
let's put this big guy to work

08:32.759 --> 08:35.568
and break some ground
on this new building.

08:36.248 --> 08:38.264
What's it doing?

08:40.671 --> 08:42.638
I'm okay, son.

08:44.092 --> 08:46.272
You've just
been Screwballed!

08:46.561 --> 08:48.108
It's Screwball!
Screwball!

08:48.240 --> 08:51.240
- I love your videos! This is awful.
- She could've hurt my dad!

08:51.459 --> 08:54.147
Don't worry, Randy.
Her pranks look worse than they are.

08:54.310 --> 08:55.623
Right, Pete?

08:55.709 --> 08:57.835
Um... Pete?

08:58.686 --> 09:00.193
Typical Parker.

09:00.389 --> 09:02.806
You took over
the worker bot?

09:03.396 --> 09:04.881
Not cool, Screwball.

09:05.055 --> 09:08.130
Ha! Are you kidding?
I'm just getting started.

09:08.188 --> 09:10.678
♪♪

09:12.624 --> 09:14.492
- Whoa!
- Screwball!

No!

09:18.492 --> 09:19.906
Hold on!

09:20.781 --> 09:22.945

09:24.809 --> 09:27.345
What in... A billboard?

09:28.696 --> 09:30.392
You're gonna answer

09:30.695 --> 09:32.353
A bungee cord?

09:35.688 --> 09:37.368
And cut!

09:37.626 --> 09:40.915
Nice work, Spidey.
I was hoping for the banner plug,

09:40.985 --> 09:43.149
but the quick-drying cement
was an added bonus.

09:44.595 --> 09:45.923
And what if someone out there

09:45.985 --> 09:48.595
needed my help while I was
preoccupied here with you?

09:48.759 --> 09:50.087
Relax, Spidey.

09:50.188 --> 09:52.063
This city is full of heroes.

09:52.149 --> 09:55.188
I can't help it if my viewers
wanna see us together.

09:57.301 --> 10:00.329
- Spidey, Spidey! Over here!
- Give us a smile.

10:00.720 --> 10:02.800
- <i>You've been Screwballed!</i>
- Nice.

10:06.919 --> 10:09.661
Are you seriously still watching

10:09.719 --> 10:11.699
stupid Internet videos?

10:11.872 --> 10:14.966
You're supposed to be getting
my drive back from Spider-Man!

10:15.106 --> 10:19.223
I tried. I broke into another
jewelry store to draw him out,

10:19.309 --> 10:22.645
but that Avenger Hawkeye
showed up instead.

10:22.739 --> 10:24.426
I don't want excuses!

10:24.544 --> 10:26.989
I want you
to find Spider-Man.

10:27.067 --> 10:30.536
Your little Internet friend here doesn't
seem to have any trouble finding him.

10:30.950 --> 10:33.778
Maybe they're partners,
like us.

10:33.903 --> 10:35.458
We are not partners.

10:35.551 --> 10:39.098
Although,
that's not a bad idea.

10:39.411 --> 10:42.262
Really? 'Cause I can move
my stuff in tomorrow.

10:42.653 --> 10:44.590
I'm talking
about the girl.

10:44.657 --> 10:48.606
We get the girl,
we get Spider-Man.

10:49.606 --> 10:51.684
But how do we find him?

10:51.880 --> 10:53.923
Look, there's
always something.

10:53.981 --> 10:56.395
Always something they forget.

10:56.601 --> 10:59.502
"Midtown High School."
There!

10:59.662 --> 11:02.153
Now get on it!

11:03.492 --> 11:05.778
<i>You've just been Screwballed!</i>

11:08.083 --> 11:10.036
Not a Screwball fan
either, huh?

11:10.208 --> 11:12.519
- I thought I was the only one.
- No way.

11:12.645 --> 11:16.137
The Internet is the most powerful
technology in human history,

11:16.223 --> 11:18.348
and we use it for prank videos.

11:18.489 --> 11:19.817
Such a waste.

11:20.778 --> 11:24.020
- Hey, is that a school project?
- What? No.

11:24.161 --> 11:28.176
- I mean, yes.
- An asymmetric encryption key?

11:28.309 --> 11:30.372
Mind if I take a look?

11:31.672 --> 11:32.840
Whoa.

11:33.973 --> 11:35.576
You don't see
a lot of these.

11:35.786 --> 11:38.778
You know what this is?
Can you crack it?

11:38.973 --> 11:42.466
Are you kidding? This kind of
problem solving is my favorite.

11:42.895 --> 11:45.083
Here. I'll show you
what you're missing.

11:45.895 --> 11:48.848
I think
what I was missing was you.

11:55.333 --> 11:57.255
Aw. Flash, you're out.

11:57.347 --> 11:59.747
Bring me Screwball!

12:01.160 --> 12:03.208
Hey, get outta here!

12:03.374 --> 12:05.942
You're out!
Get lost, freak!

12:07.005 --> 12:08.591
Now!

12:12.786 --> 12:15.723
Hey! No one's
going anywhere!

12:17.543 --> 12:18.579
Don't.

12:18.645 --> 12:21.942
Hey, one of you twerps
knows where she is.

12:22.106 --> 12:24.051
So tell me.

12:24.708 --> 12:25.726
Oh, no!

12:27.348 --> 12:29.337
Guess this isn't just
about me anymore.

12:29.395 --> 12:32.239
But maybe I can do
something from here.

12:33.864 --> 12:35.736
Spider-Man, this is Screwball.

12:36.403 --> 12:38.348
Got it!
I broke the encryption.

12:38.497 --> 12:39.856
And we have...

12:39.973 --> 12:42.450
a bunch of files
with scrambled titles,

12:42.833 --> 12:45.700
all connected to...
Hammerhead?

12:47.051 --> 12:48.575
Isn't he a gangster?

12:48.731 --> 12:51.966
He is. But what do those
scrambled titles mean?

12:52.098 --> 12:55.130
I don't know, but there are
a dozen of these files.

12:58.044 --> 13:00.970
Anya says we need to check
out the new Screwball video.

13:01.090 --> 13:04.466
She knows I'm not a fan,
so this should be interesting.

13:06.450 --> 13:08.275
<i>Spider-Man, this is Screwball.</i>

13:08.333 --> 13:11.645
<i>I need you to come to Midtown
High right away. I'm in trouble.</i>

13:11.781 --> 13:13.601
I hope Spider-Man
is watching this.

13:14.070 --> 13:16.207
It's probably
just another prank.

13:16.304 --> 13:18.429
That girl will do anything
for attention.

13:19.288 --> 13:21.984
I'm getting impatient.

13:22.218 --> 13:25.132
Hi. Randy Robertson,
freelance journalist.

13:25.335 --> 13:27.312
What do you want
with Screwball...

13:27.842 --> 13:29.007
exactly?

13:29.288 --> 13:30.591
Stop stalling!

13:30.898 --> 13:34.156
If Screwball doesn't show
herself in ten seconds,

13:34.406 --> 13:36.787
this guy's gonna be toast.

13:36.904 --> 13:38.647
- Come on, Spidey. Where are you?
- Ten.

13:38.709 --> 13:41.062
- <i>Nine. Eight.</i>
- Is it possible he's not coming?

13:41.120 --> 13:44.554
- Did I prank him one too many times?
- Seven. Six.

13:45.335 --> 13:47.660
- Okay. I don't need Spider-Man.
- Five. Four.

13:47.718 --> 13:48.773
I'm Screwball.

13:48.831 --> 13:50.788
- I'm just as good as him, right?
- Three. Two.

13:50.866 --> 13:52.327
- Better, even.
- One.

13:52.489 --> 13:56.261
Let him go!

13:56.375 --> 13:58.554
You're about to be Screwballed!

14:03.272 --> 14:04.445
Huh?

14:04.506 --> 14:08.116
Did you really think
you were a superhero?

14:08.308 --> 14:11.757
And did you really think
you could pull off that tank top?

14:12.210 --> 14:14.843
Spider-Man! You came!

14:15.038 --> 14:17.187
I was worried you thought
my video was a prank.

14:17.245 --> 14:19.411
To be honest,
I was wondering if it might be.

14:19.617 --> 14:22.075
But that's the thing
about being a hero.

14:22.158 --> 14:23.567
You don't get to wonder.

14:23.907 --> 14:26.357
Webs! I don't know why

14:26.719 --> 14:28.930
I didn't do this earlier.

14:32.550 --> 14:35.375
Smothered by webs? Feels like ir.

14:35.743 --> 14:39.164
Also feels like a good time to
use my web dissolvent.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.579
That wasn't nice!

14:43.836 --> 14:46.914
Nice? Now you're worried
about being nice?

14:52.252 --> 14:54.087
Aahh!

14:54.336 --> 14:57.711
Just give me the flash drive,
and I'll let them go!

14:58.164 --> 15:00.633
The flash drive?
That's what this is about?

15:00.750 --> 15:03.204
I don't have it on me.
Do you see pockets?

15:03.305 --> 15:05.604
Fine, then.

15:06.580 --> 15:09.936
Meet me at the New Media
building construction site.

15:10.003 --> 15:14.471
Be there in an hour, or you'll
find a couple of concrete teens

15:14.588 --> 15:16.463
waiting for ya.

15:17.911 --> 15:19.077
Get to safety!

15:22.174 --> 15:25.572
Just a sec. This is gonna get
so many likes.

15:30.024 --> 15:31.529
This is all my fault.

15:31.587 --> 15:33.563
Now, there's a news flash.

15:33.899 --> 15:37.954
But... you did put your life on the
line to save a total stranger.

15:38.029 --> 15:40.243
You're not a stranger, Randy.

15:41.628 --> 15:43.087
You're my friend.

15:43.673 --> 15:45.805
Liz? But why?

15:46.782 --> 15:48.087
I don't know.

15:48.259 --> 15:50.844
I used to feel so special.

15:51.024 --> 15:54.907
I was a straight-A student,
the class president of Midtown High.

15:54.969 --> 15:58.368
But then came genius schools like
Horizon High and Oz Academy,

15:58.446 --> 16:01.462
and those things didn't
seem to be enough anymore.

16:01.637 --> 16:03.993
So I became Screwball.

16:04.090 --> 16:06.469
Thought I could be
a hero to the community.

16:06.755 --> 16:09.956
I guess I lost sight of that when
I started focusing on Spider-Man.

16:10.180 --> 16:13.423
I felt powerful because
I had the attention.

16:13.833 --> 16:17.594
But I guess it takes a different
kind of power to be a real hero.

16:17.766 --> 16:20.805
Well, saving my life was
no small thing.

16:20.903 --> 16:22.196
Thanks.

16:28.414 --> 16:29.866
Get out!

16:34.507 --> 16:36.140
Dangling over a cement mixer?

16:36.366 --> 16:38.804
Oh, that's the last time
I let you watch the kids.

16:38.921 --> 16:41.928
Spider-Man, you made it.

16:42.062 --> 16:44.624
Hand over the drive,
and nobody gets hurt.

16:44.718 --> 16:46.899
Sure. Should I give it to you,

16:47.062 --> 16:49.800
or directly to your boss,
Hammerhead?

16:49.867 --> 16:52.968
Oh-ho, congratulations.

16:53.148 --> 16:57.233
You figured out the dumb brute's actually
working for me. You want a medal?

16:57.358 --> 17:00.746
No. Although there's probably
enough metal in your head

17:00.813 --> 17:03.069
to give me the gold,
silver, and bronze.

17:03.202 --> 17:04.929
Just deliver the goods,

17:05.016 --> 17:08.085
and we'll let the kids go.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.515
Sure thing.

17:11.085 --> 17:12.452
Now let them go.

17:12.596 --> 17:15.763
Oh, that's exactly
what I plan on doing.

17:16.027 --> 17:17.762
Drop 'em!

17:19.672 --> 17:22.296
I knew a thug like you
couldn't be trusted.

17:22.358 --> 17:24.878
But I thought I'd give you a
chance before I went to the police

17:24.936 --> 17:27.227
with the list of businesses
you're using to launder money.

17:27.285 --> 17:29.289
What? Well, how did you...

17:29.368 --> 17:32.203
Easy. Just used
the old noggin.

17:32.328 --> 17:34.797
Extinguish that bug!

17:39.348 --> 17:40.349
Oops.

17:40.407 --> 17:42.625
Can't I have
just one person

17:42.688 --> 17:44.633
that does what
I need 'em to do?

17:44.691 --> 17:47.016
I'll take care
of this myself.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.869
See how easily you're
replaced, Absorbing Man?

17:56.936 --> 18:00.352
Clearly, your boss likes 'em
big, bad, and easy to control.

18:00.892 --> 18:01.994
Oh?

18:02.297 --> 18:05.914
Then he's gonna love
this new power I have.

18:06.063 --> 18:08.649
Sometimes I don't know
why I open my mouth.

18:11.649 --> 18:14.578
Didn't know I could
increase in size, did ya?

18:14.821 --> 18:17.755
Hold still. I'll have us
outta here in a second.

18:17.822 --> 18:19.924
You increased
in size and strength,

18:19.991 --> 18:22.159
but sadly not in looks.

18:26.032 --> 18:28.132
No!

18:30.854 --> 18:32.518
I just got an idea.

18:32.721 --> 18:35.268
Yo, chrome dome!
Over here!

18:42.190 --> 18:44.175
That's an impressive ability
you have there.

18:44.245 --> 18:47.151
Not as impressive as absorbing
knowledge, of course.

18:48.714 --> 18:52.245
I'd pick strength
over smarts any day.

18:52.987 --> 18:55.335
I figured.
Otherwise you would've realized

18:55.393 --> 18:57.921
that the metal you just absorbed
was lithium.

18:57.979 --> 19:00.292
Yeah? So what?

19:00.495 --> 19:03.870
So, lithium doesn't react well
with certain compounds.

19:04.026 --> 19:05.698
Like your face?

19:05.978 --> 19:07.069
No.

19:08.136 --> 19:09.198
Like water.

19:09.317 --> 19:10.951
Huh?

19:19.807 --> 19:22.276
Is he gone?
Sadly, I doubt it.

19:22.370 --> 19:24.557
He'll probably pull himself
together soon enough.

19:24.620 --> 19:26.503
Still, that was amazing!

19:26.589 --> 19:28.815
- You saved the day!
- With your help.

19:29.026 --> 19:32.257
That drive didn't mean a thing until
I remembered the story on your blog

19:32.315 --> 19:34.300
about the companies
that were just bought up.

19:34.362 --> 19:35.801
You...

19:35.948 --> 19:37.886
You read my blog?

19:38.003 --> 19:40.268
Spider-Man is one of
my three hits!

19:40.346 --> 19:41.932
Uh-oh.

19:42.089 --> 19:43.696
Spider-Sense. Whoa!

19:43.754 --> 19:46.751
I'm gonna crush
you like the insect you are!

19:49.323 --> 19:51.852
What's wrong with
this piece of junk?

19:52.126 --> 19:54.306
You've just been Screwballed!

19:55.736 --> 19:57.855
Wha... You've gotta be...
Hey!

19:57.922 --> 19:59.992
I hate that kid!

20:00.253 --> 20:03.363
You've just been Spider-Man-ned!

20:05.932 --> 20:08.167
Hope you got his swan dive
on camera.

20:08.225 --> 20:11.105
Oh, I got it.
Among other things.

20:12.896 --> 20:14.896
You've been screwballed.

20:16.556 --> 20:18.082
It's pretty funny.

20:18.878 --> 20:20.563
Depends
on what side you're on.

20:20.707 --> 20:23.753
Although today, I was glad
you were on my side.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.738
But I also started
this whole mess.

20:26.839 --> 20:28.844
Fixing your mistakes
is part of being a hero.

20:29.277 --> 20:31.378
A hero? Me?

20:31.457 --> 20:33.800
After today? Absolutely.

20:34.902 --> 20:37.019
That's better
than a million likes.

20:37.269 --> 20:40.957
Still, maybe it's time
I went back to just being me.

20:43.566 --> 20:44.797
Liz Allan?

20:44.956 --> 20:46.886
You know who I am?

20:47.027 --> 20:48.789
Uh, of course.

20:48.847 --> 20:51.191
You're Midtown High's class president.

20:51.261 --> 20:52.574
Everybody knows that.

20:53.722 --> 20:55.164
And the perfect person

20:55.222 --> 20:57.394
to hand over Absorbing Man
to the police.

20:57.691 --> 20:59.503
Not to mention Hammerhead.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.332
So, it turns out
the biggest Spidey fail

21:02.394 --> 21:04.211
was that I failed Spidey.

21:04.269 --> 21:06.417
<i>He was doing the kind of good
I set out to do,</i>

21:06.511 --> 21:09.172
<i>but I got caught up
in the popularity of it all.</i>

21:09.230 --> 21:10.963
<i>And I'm sorry about that.</i>

21:11.230 --> 21:14.094
<i>This is my last Screwball video
for a while.</i>

21:14.152 --> 21:16.035
<i>In the meantime,
for real news,</i>

21:16.128 --> 21:19.112
<i>Randy Robertson's blog
has got you covered.</i>

21:19.183 --> 21:20.925
So Spidey saved the day.

21:21.027 --> 21:23.472
I guess he really is
a true hero, huh, Harry?

21:23.894 --> 21:25.117
Aw, please!

21:25.175 --> 21:28.222
You can't believe everything
you see on the Internet, Pete.

21:28.845 --> 21:30.992
Uh! Oh!
