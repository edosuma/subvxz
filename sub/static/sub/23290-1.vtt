00:20.646 --> 00:22.104
- High school.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.858
A lot of firsts.

00:25.024 --> 00:26.652
Lots of laughter.

00:27.611 --> 00:29.028
Some tears.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.655
Drama.

00:30.656 --> 00:31.906
Concerts.

00:31.907 --> 00:33.282
Games.

00:33.283 --> 00:34.993
Cramming for tests.

00:34.994 --> 00:36.870
Endless homework.

00:36.871 --> 00:37.997
Partying.

00:38.831 --> 00:39.914
Gossip.

00:39.915 --> 00:41.081
Crushes.

00:41.082 --> 00:42.834
Hookups.

00:42.835 --> 00:44.419
And most of all...

00:47.214 --> 00:48.423
Friends.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.871
That morning I woke up

00:58.872 --> 01:01.144
to two text messages.

01:02.396 --> 01:05.065
One said, "Are you okay?"

01:06.692 --> 01:07.881
And the other one

01:07.882 --> 01:09.068
said, "Did you hear?"

01:09.069 --> 01:11.111
So I called my friend

01:11.112 --> 01:13.155
and there was a long pause

01:13.156 --> 01:14.804
and she said, "Oh my

01:14.805 --> 01:16.450
gosh, you don't know."

01:16.451 --> 01:18.433
And I'm saying, what

01:18.434 --> 01:20.414
are you talking about?

01:22.791 --> 01:25.106
She told me my best friend

01:25.107 --> 01:27.421
killed herself last night.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.113
I remember, I just

01:32.114 --> 01:33.426
fell to the floor

01:33.427 --> 01:35.093
and I just closed my eyes.

01:35.094 --> 01:36.847
I was like, please,

01:36.848 --> 01:38.599
let this not be true.

01:41.894 --> 01:44.353
I couldn't believe it was true.

01:44.354 --> 01:47.045
I kept wishing that I would

01:47.046 --> 01:49.734
see her in the hallway.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.424
I wanted so badly

01:51.425 --> 01:53.112
for her to be there.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.281
I hated the fact that

01:54.282 --> 01:55.448
I'll never get to

01:55.449 --> 01:57.534
sit with her at lunch.

02:00.079 --> 02:02.519
That I would never get to

02:02.520 --> 02:04.959
sit next to her in class.

02:07.086 --> 02:08.920
I was so confused.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.425
I was so sad.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.430
Then I was angry.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.393
And I felt so guilty.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.274
How could she do this to me?

02:30.943 --> 02:33.027
I was one of her best friends

02:33.028 --> 02:34.050
and she felt like

02:34.051 --> 02:35.071
she couldn't tell me.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.948
Was I not supportive enough?

02:36.949 --> 02:38.658
Was I not there for her?

02:38.659 --> 02:40.578
Did she feel like she

02:40.579 --> 02:42.495
couldn't talk to me?

02:42.496 --> 02:44.165
That was the biggest

02:44.166 --> 02:45.832
question for me.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.481
Why couldn't she

02:47.482 --> 02:49.127
reach out to me?

02:49.128 --> 02:50.544
Because if she did just tell me,

02:50.545 --> 02:52.673
I would've been there.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.044
The next few months I

03:10.045 --> 03:11.816
closed up all my emotions.

03:11.817 --> 03:14.090
I just didn't want

03:14.091 --> 03:16.362
to think about it.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.740
I only wanted to

03:17.741 --> 03:19.116
focus on school.

03:20.492 --> 03:21.785
And then in December

03:21.786 --> 03:23.077
someone else

03:23.078 --> 03:25.913
from my school took his life.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.937
And immediately all

03:27.938 --> 03:29.959
those emotions came back.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.920
- After a while it felt like -
it was a monthly occurrence.

03:31.923 --> 03:33.464
Another teen would

03:33.465 --> 03:35.006
take his or her life.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.884
- It is an uncomfortable
- topic for many,

03:36.887 --> 03:38.092
But teen suicide...

03:38.093 --> 03:39.178
- Suicide.
- Suicide.

03:39.179 --> 03:40.179
- Suicide.

03:40.180 --> 03:41.846
- Suicide.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.431
- A 16-year-old student -
who committed suicide.

03:43.434 --> 03:45.142
- They told me it's -
just sad that people

03:45.145 --> 03:46.685
- Are coming together
- to show their love

03:46.688 --> 03:48.061
For Jessica now

03:48.062 --> 03:49.437
when it's too late.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.069
- By the end of the school year,

03:56.070 --> 03:57.945
six teens in our community,

03:57.946 --> 04:00.887
including my best friend,

04:00.888 --> 04:03.826
had taken their lives.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.975
One after another teen

04:05.976 --> 04:08.122
taking his or her life.

04:08.123 --> 04:10.791
I couldn't take it anymore.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.377
I wanted to prevent another one.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.296
- I didn't want to -
feel the way I did,

04:15.299 --> 04:16.548
And I didn't want our

04:16.548 --> 04:17.798
community to lose another life.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.158
I couldn't help but

04:22.159 --> 04:23.596
think what if I asked?

04:23.597 --> 04:25.390
What if I asked if she was okay?

04:28.435 --> 04:29.957
She never said

04:29.958 --> 04:31.478
she was depressed.

04:31.479 --> 04:32.794
How would I have

04:32.795 --> 04:34.107
known this giggly,

04:34.108 --> 04:36.068
bubbly girl who made

04:36.069 --> 04:38.028
me laugh, was suicidal?

04:40.530 --> 04:43.242
It just didn't make any sense.

04:47.495 --> 04:50.019
I started to research teen

04:50.020 --> 04:52.541
suicide and depression,

04:52.542 --> 04:54.795
looking for answers.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.098
- I found that there
- are often signs

05:06.101 --> 05:07.787
When someone is

05:07.788 --> 05:09.476
thinking of suicide.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.189
My friend exhibited

05:14.190 --> 05:16.482
some of these signs.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.881
I didn't really pick

05:17.882 --> 05:19.277
it up as a sign.

05:19.278 --> 05:20.569
I mean how could I?

05:20.570 --> 05:21.862
I was a teen.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.489
I didn't know anything about,

05:23.490 --> 05:24.512
I don't know anything

05:24.513 --> 05:25.532
about the signs,

05:25.533 --> 05:27.576
I didn't know anything then.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.851
There were no resources for

05:29.852 --> 05:32.123
me to know what that meant.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.042
- Why aren't we talking
- about depression

05:34.045 --> 05:36.169
And suicide at school?

05:36.170 --> 05:39.172
It is hushed in the classrooms.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.383
Why is there such a stigma

05:41.384 --> 05:43.593
around mental health?

05:45.470 --> 05:46.763
So I went to

05:46.764 --> 05:48.055
organizations and experts

05:48.056 --> 05:49.662
to find people who would

05:49.663 --> 05:51.267
talk to me about it.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.145
- I took seminars -
where I learned how

05:53.148 --> 05:56.023
To help someone who is suicidal.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.194
But, I still had

06:00.195 --> 06:01.862
so many questions.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.990
Why were teens feeling this way?

06:05.991 --> 06:08.534
What were they thinking?

06:08.535 --> 06:09.995
And why didn't they

06:09.996 --> 06:11.453
talk to anybody?

06:11.454 --> 06:13.435
Or did they and we

06:13.436 --> 06:15.416
just didn't hear them?

06:19.504 --> 06:20.964
Every day at school

06:20.965 --> 06:22.422
people say, oh, I'm tired,

06:22.423 --> 06:23.967
I don't want to be

06:23.968 --> 06:25.509
here, or kill me now,

06:25.510 --> 06:27.325
or FML or all these

06:27.326 --> 06:29.139
little things that

06:30.640 --> 06:32.079
it's hard to pick up on

06:32.080 --> 06:33.517
when it's really real.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.499
Like how do you know

06:35.500 --> 06:37.479
when it's just someone

06:37.480 --> 06:39.941
being dramatic or if

06:39.942 --> 06:42.400
they're really serious?

06:42.401 --> 06:43.987
How do you know when it's

06:43.988 --> 06:45.571
someone who's suicidal

06:45.572 --> 06:47.971
or if it's someone just

06:47.972 --> 06:50.368
being a regular teen?

06:50.369 --> 06:52.078
To truly understand,

06:52.079 --> 06:53.747
I needed to have a

06:53.748 --> 06:55.413
conversation teen to teen

06:55.414 --> 06:56.979
with those who

06:56.980 --> 06:58.543
had felt suicidal.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.588
I wanted to break the silence,

07:02.589 --> 07:05.112
and encourage those who

07:05.113 --> 07:07.634
are suffering to reach out.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.888
I decided to make a film

07:09.889 --> 07:12.140
to give teens a voice.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.477
I made flyers and

07:15.478 --> 07:17.187
created a Facebook Page.

07:19.398 --> 07:21.129
And in less than 24 hours

07:21.130 --> 07:22.858
I received a ton of feedback

07:22.859 --> 07:25.862
and over 500 Likes on Facebook.

07:27.488 --> 07:28.552
At first I was

07:28.553 --> 07:29.615
excited so many teens

07:29.616 --> 07:32.056
were willing to be

07:32.057 --> 07:34.494
a part of the film.

07:34.495 --> 07:35.768
But then I realized

07:35.769 --> 07:37.039
that all these teens

07:37.040 --> 07:39.709
have been in a lot of pain.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.711
Some I never met before.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.089
But some I knew and

07:44.090 --> 07:45.464
others were even friends

07:45.465 --> 07:47.175
that I had known

07:47.176 --> 07:48.884
for a long time.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.220
Deep breath.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.513
Okay.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.246
I've known you since I've

07:55.247 --> 07:56.976
been what, like, kindergarten?

07:56.977 --> 07:58.185
- Yeah, like four?

07:58.186 --> 07:59.228
- Yeah.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.896
- Four or five.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.565
- When was the first -
time you started having

08:02.568 --> 08:03.587
Like really, when

08:03.588 --> 08:04.608
you started noticing

08:04.609 --> 08:06.111
that you're really

08:06.112 --> 08:07.611
sad or depressed?

08:07.612 --> 08:09.260
- When I was in third grade,

08:09.261 --> 08:10.906
actually it was really early,

08:10.907 --> 08:12.284
I started to not

08:12.285 --> 08:13.659
like how I looked.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.141
I noticed that I didn't

08:15.142 --> 08:16.620
look like everybody else.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.665
My friends were skinnier

08:18.666 --> 08:20.707
and they were really like,

08:20.708 --> 08:22.669
- they were really pretty
- and guys liked them.

08:22.672 --> 08:24.254
And I just felt really

08:24.255 --> 08:25.838
kind of out of it.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.547
I didn't feel comfortable.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.716
And I started to blame myself

08:29.717 --> 08:32.011
and just kind of not

08:32.013 --> 08:34.304
really care about myself

08:34.306 --> 08:36.308
because I just thought

08:36.308 --> 08:38.309
that it was my fault.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.115
Middle school was

08:52.116 --> 08:53.240
really clicque-y for me

08:53.241 --> 08:55.576
definitely and everyone.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.102
There was some kind

08:59.103 --> 09:00.706
of app on Facebook.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.105
Anyone could say whatever

09:02.106 --> 09:03.501
they wanted to say about you

09:03.502 --> 09:04.962
and you wouldn't

09:04.963 --> 09:06.420
know who said that.

09:06.421 --> 09:08.340
- What kind of -
things did they say?

09:08.343 --> 09:09.425
- Just like, oh,

09:09.426 --> 09:10.508
like she's ugly.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.134
Like, she's like fat.

09:12.135 --> 09:13.760
Like, she's not cool.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.055
- Like, she thinks she -
has all these friends,

09:15.058 --> 09:17.056
But she doesn't.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.288
I tried to brush it off and

09:18.289 --> 09:19.517
I pretended to brush it off,

09:19.518 --> 09:21.124
but I mean obviously when

09:21.125 --> 09:22.728
you hear something like that,

09:22.729 --> 09:24.940
to an extent over time,

09:24.941 --> 09:27.149
it does get to you.

09:27.150 --> 09:29.340
It really lowers

09:29.341 --> 09:31.529
your self-esteem.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.219
- I was made fun of by the

09:33.220 --> 09:34.907
black girls at my school

09:34.908 --> 09:36.034
because I'm

09:36.035 --> 09:37.159
obviously half black.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.371
But I am like, I don't

09:39.372 --> 09:41.580
act half black at all.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.667
So I act very white, so they'd

09:43.668 --> 09:45.751
call me whitewashed or Oreo.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.024
And I'm not super skinny,

09:47.025 --> 09:48.295
so they'd also call

09:48.296 --> 09:49.796
me double-stuffed Oreo,

09:49.797 --> 09:51.549
which wasn't fun at all.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.468
- When these girls -
would say these things,

09:53.471 --> 09:54.970
Would you just try to

09:54.971 --> 09:56.470
brush it off or would you...

09:56.471 --> 09:57.660
- I would go to the

09:57.661 --> 09:58.847
bathroom and try not to cry,

09:58.848 --> 10:00.037
but then cry and then

10:00.038 --> 10:01.225
try to make it look

10:01.226 --> 10:03.394
like I wasn't crying.

10:03.395 --> 10:04.417
And it was just a

10:04.418 --> 10:05.438
really bad cycle,

10:05.439 --> 10:06.941
'cause there was no way

10:06.942 --> 10:08.441
for me to get away from it.

10:08.442 --> 10:09.568
For black girls, I

10:09.569 --> 10:10.692
wasn't black enough.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.153
And then for the white girls,

10:12.154 --> 10:13.612
still wasn't really white.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.635
I'm adopted into an

10:14.636 --> 10:15.655
all-white family,

10:15.656 --> 10:16.971
so it was just so

10:16.972 --> 10:18.284
hard in sixth grade

10:18.285 --> 10:19.910
trying to figure out who you are

10:19.911 --> 10:21.287
and having people tell you that

10:21.288 --> 10:23.331
who you are is wrong.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.211
- Puberty hits and

10:28.212 --> 10:29.587
things get kind of weird

10:29.588 --> 10:30.879
and then there's girls and guys,

10:30.880 --> 10:33.006
and a lot of stuff comes up.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.508
And so there were social norms

10:34.509 --> 10:36.051
that people had to fit into.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.596
- Like girls had to
- act a certain way

10:37.599 --> 10:39.473
- And guys had to -
act a certain way.

10:39.476 --> 10:41.182
- There was a lot of -
feminine and masculine

10:41.185 --> 10:43.184
- Energy going on and
- it wasn't really,

10:43.187 --> 10:44.435
It couldn't really cross over.

10:44.436 --> 10:45.978
Like guys couldn't be feminine

10:45.979 --> 10:47.896
and girls couldn't be masculine.

10:47.897 --> 10:48.898
So I just felt a little

10:48.899 --> 10:49.899
bit uncomfortable

10:49.900 --> 10:52.109
starting in middle school.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.819
Especially because I am gay

10:53.820 --> 10:55.134
and I felt like I had

10:55.135 --> 10:56.447
to conform to a certain

10:56.448 --> 10:57.678
system or just a way

10:57.679 --> 10:58.907
of being that wasn't

10:58.908 --> 11:00.701
necessarily right.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.562
- My middle school

11:06.563 --> 11:08.460
experience was,

11:11.087 --> 11:13.922
well, it was less than perfect

11:13.923 --> 11:15.508
to say the least.

11:15.509 --> 11:16.677
And I just wanted

11:16.678 --> 11:17.843
to kind of fit in.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.492
I feel like I managed

11:19.493 --> 11:21.139
to do that somewhat.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.020
There was one group I

11:27.021 --> 11:28.228
wanted to stay friends with

11:28.229 --> 11:30.127
that didn't really

11:30.128 --> 11:32.025
feel the same about me.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.427
I didn't really know

11:37.428 --> 11:39.490
where the line was

11:39.491 --> 11:43.577
between joking and serious.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.163
- You know, when my friends
- would joke with me,

11:45.166 --> 11:46.706
I would take it

11:46.707 --> 11:48.248
really personally.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.834
A lot of fumbling around,

11:50.835 --> 11:52.108
trying to find where

11:52.109 --> 11:53.379
the heck I'm supposed

11:53.380 --> 11:56.131
to actually belong.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.924
Every time they knocked me down,

11:57.925 --> 11:59.594
I just got right back up

11:59.595 --> 12:01.261
again and went back over.

12:01.262 --> 12:02.430
Gradually everyone

12:02.431 --> 12:03.597
else started to lose

12:03.598 --> 12:05.558
respect for me for that.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.915
My social world is kind of

12:07.916 --> 12:10.270
just spiraling at that point,

12:10.271 --> 12:11.877
and with it kind

12:11.878 --> 12:13.482
of my motivation,

12:13.483 --> 12:16.527
and my grades are slipping,

12:16.528 --> 12:18.780
and depression kind of

12:18.781 --> 12:21.032
started to really ramp up.

12:22.534 --> 12:23.848
It's kind of where

12:23.849 --> 12:25.160
everything started to

12:25.161 --> 12:26.995
collapse, I guess,

12:26.996 --> 12:28.831
was freshman year.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.232
- Who

12:33.233 --> 12:34.587
can't relate to that?

12:34.588 --> 12:36.381
Feeling left out.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.510
Every teen wants to

12:40.511 --> 12:42.511
be at every party.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.639
We all want to be included

12:44.640 --> 12:46.765
and feel connected.

12:48.518 --> 12:49.999
- I really wanted to

12:50.000 --> 12:51.478
be with the in crowd

12:51.479 --> 12:53.230
or with the popular people.

12:53.231 --> 12:54.420
I was determined to make

12:54.421 --> 12:55.608
a change about myself.

12:55.609 --> 12:56.610
And it was almost like

12:56.611 --> 12:57.611
an obsessive thing.

12:57.612 --> 12:59.361
Like I need to do this.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.635
I need to look the part

13:01.636 --> 13:03.908
and do everything perfect.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.620
A goal of being so

13:07.621 --> 13:09.787
perfect all the time,

13:09.788 --> 13:11.873
it's so unrealistic and it felt

13:11.874 --> 13:12.896
so hard to achieve that I

13:12.897 --> 13:13.917
think it brought me down

13:13.918 --> 13:15.566
and that's what

13:15.567 --> 13:17.213
kind of started it.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.133
There was not a single

13:20.134 --> 13:21.550
day that I remember

13:21.551 --> 13:23.343
that things just changed.

13:23.344 --> 13:24.637
It was slow and it

13:24.638 --> 13:25.929
almost creeped up on me

13:25.930 --> 13:27.682
and I didn't see

13:27.683 --> 13:29.433
it coming one bit.

13:29.434 --> 13:30.685
It was the summer right

13:30.686 --> 13:31.935
after my freshman year,

13:31.936 --> 13:33.521
and I would sit on the

13:33.522 --> 13:35.105
couch and I wouldn't go out

13:35.106 --> 13:37.525
and I would just watch TV.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.635
I think I knew

13:42.636 --> 13:43.781
eventually when I was

13:43.782 --> 13:45.240
just very unhappy all the time

13:45.241 --> 13:47.034
- and nothing made -
me smile anymore.

13:47.037 --> 13:48.827
- And everything I -
previously loved to do

13:48.830 --> 13:50.204
Just didn't bring me

13:50.205 --> 13:51.580
entertainment anymore.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.206
Like, I loved to ride horses

13:53.207 --> 13:55.084
- and I went out and -
ride horses and it just

13:55.087 --> 13:57.002
Made me miserable.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.463
And I was like, wow,

13:58.464 --> 13:59.921
even the little things

13:59.922 --> 14:02.217
that I loved to do,

14:02.218 --> 14:04.510
they aren't fun anymore.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.325
- I grew up in

14:06.326 --> 14:08.138
a picture-perfect home

14:08.139 --> 14:10.140
with the best parents.

14:10.141 --> 14:11.391
I had a ton of friends.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.059
I made great grades.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.625
I was involved in every

14:14.626 --> 14:16.188
aspect of my school

14:16.189 --> 14:18.607
and I suffered from depression.

14:18.608 --> 14:21.610
And I felt so guilty.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.987
I was so caught up in believing

14:23.988 --> 14:25.386
that my depression

14:25.387 --> 14:26.782
wasn't real because

14:26.783 --> 14:27.909
I didn't have a reason

14:27.910 --> 14:29.034
to be depressed.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.016
But you don't need a

14:31.017 --> 14:32.996
reason to be depressed.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.915
- We mask - what
we're really feeling

14:34.918 --> 14:36.709
With friends, at

14:36.710 --> 14:38.503
home, on social media.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.883
I think we're afraid to show

14:42.884 --> 14:44.550
what we are really feeling.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.052
That we don't have it all.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.680
And that our lives

14:48.681 --> 14:50.306
aren't perfect.

14:51.850 --> 14:52.955
- I wanted to be able

14:52.956 --> 14:54.059
to make straight A's

14:54.060 --> 14:55.791
and all AP, GT or gift

14:55.792 --> 14:57.521
and talented classes

14:57.522 --> 14:58.940
while being able to

14:58.941 --> 15:00.357
go out all the time,

15:00.358 --> 15:01.983
keep up all these friends,

15:01.984 --> 15:03.632
and play sports and be

15:03.633 --> 15:05.278
involved in newspaper

15:05.279 --> 15:06.905
and student council,

15:06.906 --> 15:08.658
- and it was just so -
many different things

15:08.661 --> 15:10.201
- That I wanted to be -
the best that I could

15:10.204 --> 15:11.703
- And better than -
everybody else at.

15:11.706 --> 15:13.121
And it became

15:13.122 --> 15:14.538
physically exhausting.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.457
- Why did you feel
- like you had to

15:16.460 --> 15:19.084
Do all this stuff?

15:19.085 --> 15:20.441
- I wanted really

15:20.442 --> 15:21.796
badly to be enough.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.822
But for me I was never

15:26.823 --> 15:28.051
fully satisfied with it

15:28.052 --> 15:29.053
and it was always I

15:29.054 --> 15:30.054
could've done better

15:30.055 --> 15:32.056
on this test or I could've

15:32.057 --> 15:34.057
earned higher achievements.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.894
I wanted everything just to

15:35.895 --> 15:37.729
be so perfect and I wasn't.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.774
Freshman year things

15:40.775 --> 15:41.940
started to feel differently,

15:41.941 --> 15:43.026
but I wasn't like

15:43.027 --> 15:44.109
couldn't get out of bed

15:44.110 --> 15:45.611
in the morning kind of.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.280
- And then sophomore -
year it got really bad

15:47.283 --> 15:49.198
- Where I would just -
wake up and not want

15:49.201 --> 15:50.449
To go to school.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.742
And I used to love school.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.201
Like, learning is my thing.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.037
- And I didn't want
- to go to school.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.268
It was just like going

15:56.269 --> 15:57.497
through motions every day

15:57.498 --> 15:58.875
and I wasn't feeling

15:58.876 --> 16:00.251
anything at all.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.384
- I was transitioning

16:07.385 --> 16:08.884
into a different lifestyle

16:08.885 --> 16:10.408
and it was pretty easy to

16:10.409 --> 16:11.929
get depressed and hopeless

16:11.930 --> 16:14.055
because sometimes I would think,

16:14.056 --> 16:15.433
oh, no one understands

16:15.434 --> 16:16.809
me or I can't fit in

16:16.810 --> 16:18.415
because all of these people,

16:18.416 --> 16:20.019
they just don't get me.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.564
So it would be depressing

16:21.565 --> 16:23.106
in moments like that

16:23.107 --> 16:24.484
when I was by myself

16:24.485 --> 16:25.859
and more alone.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.362
So yeah, I did struggle

16:27.363 --> 16:28.862
with depression.

16:28.863 --> 16:29.948
Still do.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.357
- What does

16:43.358 --> 16:44.628
depression feel like?

16:44.629 --> 16:47.047
Try to describe it to me.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.926
- It's basically like

16:51.886 --> 16:52.908
you're drowning

16:52.909 --> 16:53.929
and you're watching

16:53.930 --> 16:56.850
everyone around you breathing.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.790
- It's like standing

16:59.791 --> 17:01.227
in front of a window

17:01.228 --> 17:03.188
when it's pouring rain

17:03.189 --> 17:04.691
and thundering and debris

17:04.692 --> 17:06.191
is just falling in the room

17:06.192 --> 17:07.901
and you cannot shut the window.

17:07.902 --> 17:10.111
Like you cannot turn it off.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.385
- Every single day

17:11.386 --> 17:12.656
was just like walking

17:12.656 --> 17:14.825
in a big stream of water,

17:14.826 --> 17:16.536
- like walking upstream -
and it's pushing against

17:16.539 --> 17:18.412
- You so hard and you
- just think it would

17:18.415 --> 17:19.768
Be so much easier to just

17:19.769 --> 17:21.122
let yourself fall in.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.001
- And it's so heavy

17:23.002 --> 17:24.877
and I couldn't lift it

17:24.877 --> 17:25.942
and I couldn't get

17:25.943 --> 17:27.003
out from under it.

17:27.005 --> 17:28.068
And I felt like I

17:28.069 --> 17:29.130
was crushing me.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.362
- I just, I couldn't

17:30.363 --> 17:31.591
get up in the morning.

17:31.592 --> 17:35.512
I was like a zombie.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.140
- You don't want to

17:37.141 --> 17:38.765
get out of bed ever.

17:38.766 --> 17:41.185
I remember telling my

17:41.186 --> 17:43.603
mom when I was little,

17:43.604 --> 17:45.480
probably in fifth grade,

17:45.481 --> 17:46.607
- I remember telling her that
- I wanted to go to sleep

17:46.610 --> 17:48.274
And never wake up.

17:48.275 --> 17:49.610
- It was so hard to -
get up every morning.

17:49.613 --> 17:51.319
I just wanted to be dead.

17:51.320 --> 17:55.323
- And the reason it's so easy to

17:55.324 --> 17:56.909
consider committing

17:56.910 --> 17:58.493
suicide is because

17:58.494 --> 17:59.891
it's so exhausting

17:59.892 --> 18:01.287
to stand there

18:01.288 --> 18:02.894
in front of that window

18:02.895 --> 18:04.499
every single day.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.190
- Like you feel

18:06.191 --> 18:07.878
there's just no way

18:07.879 --> 18:09.755
that it's ever gonna get better.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.175
Like there's no hope

18:12.176 --> 18:14.593
for your future at all.

18:14.594 --> 18:18.513
- It just felt really lonely

18:18.514 --> 18:20.348
and kind of like numb.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.371
- To me what depression

18:21.372 --> 18:22.392
is is just that

18:22.393 --> 18:25.020
emptiness and void.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.168
It's kind of like a

18:26.169 --> 18:27.313
black hole where nothing

18:27.314 --> 18:28.482
is going on and you

18:28.483 --> 18:29.649
know that something,

18:29.650 --> 18:30.922
some emotion should be

18:30.923 --> 18:32.194
going on, but they're not.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.410
- My first day of sixth grade,

18:40.411 --> 18:41.995
when I got home from school,

18:41.996 --> 18:43.227
I found out that

18:43.228 --> 18:44.456
my dad passed away.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.374
I wasn't sad.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.667
I was really angry.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.586
He was a alcoholic,

18:49.587 --> 18:51.379
so...

18:51.380 --> 18:53.298
it was kind of a relief

18:53.299 --> 18:55.259
- when I find out he -
wasn't alive anymore

18:55.262 --> 18:56.427
'cause he caused

18:56.428 --> 18:57.594
me a lot of pain

18:57.595 --> 18:59.931
leading up to his death.

19:06.353 --> 19:07.354
Somewhere between sixth

19:07.355 --> 19:08.355
and seventh grade,

19:08.356 --> 19:09.899
- I started getting -
really, really sad

19:09.902 --> 19:11.232
About my dad's death,

19:11.233 --> 19:12.651
and I started to blame myself,

19:12.652 --> 19:14.946
that it was my fault.

19:16.614 --> 19:19.616
If I was a better daughter.

19:19.617 --> 19:22.327
If I wasn't as mean.

19:22.328 --> 19:23.870
If I got better grades

19:23.871 --> 19:25.247
- maybe my dad wouldn't
- have had to drink

19:25.250 --> 19:26.706
Or maybe he wouldn't have left

19:26.707 --> 19:27.917
or maybe he wouldn't

19:27.918 --> 19:29.127
have even died.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.297
Going into seventh grade, I

19:33.298 --> 19:35.298
was in a pretty dark place.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.156
I didn't really know

19:37.157 --> 19:39.011
how to exist anymore

19:39.012 --> 19:40.493
because I thought that

19:40.494 --> 19:41.972
everything was my fault.

19:41.973 --> 19:44.163
And then I started to cut

19:44.164 --> 19:46.351
myself in seventh grade,

19:46.352 --> 19:47.854
just because I felt

19:47.855 --> 19:49.354
like it was that way

19:49.355 --> 19:50.690
that I could give

19:50.691 --> 19:52.024
control in my life.

19:52.025 --> 19:55.443
The way that I could decide

19:55.444 --> 19:56.778
what was gonna happen to me.

19:56.779 --> 19:59.531
And also I could punish myself.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.366
I never wanted to be at a point

20:01.367 --> 20:02.410
where I couldn't

20:02.411 --> 20:03.451
control it anymore,

20:03.452 --> 20:04.953
'cause that was my thing.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.706
- I wanted control,
- I wanted power.

20:06.709 --> 20:08.040
And I could control this.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.960
I could control hurting myself.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.177
- Dig the knife -
in a little deeper,

20:19.180 --> 20:20.468
The voices shrieked.

20:20.469 --> 20:23.805
So deeper and deeper I went.

20:23.806 --> 20:25.057
As the knife dug in,

20:25.058 --> 20:26.307
my body screamed,

20:26.308 --> 20:29.728
but the voices silenced it.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.293
My skin begged and

20:31.294 --> 20:32.856
begged for more.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.150
Just one more cut

20:34.151 --> 20:35.441
of my fleshy skin.

20:35.442 --> 20:36.965
The rush, the kick

20:36.966 --> 20:38.486
has just set in,

20:38.487 --> 20:40.655
but I am no longer myself,

20:40.656 --> 20:42.532
for the demons have taken over

20:42.533 --> 20:45.203
and I am inappropriately happy.

20:49.123 --> 20:50.416
- I think I was just hurting

20:50.417 --> 20:51.708
so badly on the inside

20:51.709 --> 20:55.378
that I wanted to feel something.

20:55.379 --> 20:58.631
Self-harm seems like a good idea

20:58.632 --> 21:01.134
whenever you're in that moment,

21:01.135 --> 21:02.282
but it's never

21:02.283 --> 21:03.428
going to fully mask

21:03.429 --> 21:04.451
the pain you're

21:04.452 --> 21:05.471
feeling on the inside.

21:05.472 --> 21:06.974
- Putting yourself -
through that kind of

21:06.977 --> 21:08.935
Physical pain is...

21:10.603 --> 21:12.562
pointless.

21:12.563 --> 21:14.648
- I would be distracted by -
the physical pain for a while,

21:14.651 --> 21:16.066
But it never fixed anything.

21:16.067 --> 21:17.776
It never helped me.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.967
It never did anything

21:19.968 --> 21:22.155
to benefit me at all.

21:22.156 --> 21:24.407
- Can I see your scars?

21:24.408 --> 21:25.491
- Yeah.

21:25.492 --> 21:29.621
So there's some like,

21:29.622 --> 21:31.081
you know,

21:31.082 --> 21:33.585
these little dots

21:33.586 --> 21:36.086
are from burns.

21:36.087 --> 21:38.965
I wrote the word hate,

21:40.800 --> 21:42.676
just carved into my arm.

21:44.595 --> 21:46.012
- Wow.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.306
- Self-harm was

21:47.307 --> 21:48.598
kind of a way of,

21:48.599 --> 21:51.226
kind of a cry for help.

21:51.227 --> 21:53.187
- At the time was there -
anything that you wanted?

21:53.190 --> 21:54.855
Was there something you wish

21:54.856 --> 21:56.522
somebody would say or do?

21:56.523 --> 21:58.442
Or was there something

21:58.443 --> 22:00.360
that you wanted?

22:02.029 --> 22:03.571
- I mean, like honestly,

22:03.572 --> 22:05.095
I don't know how I

22:05.096 --> 22:06.616
could've made this,

22:06.617 --> 22:08.493
how I could've made this clear

22:08.494 --> 22:09.912
for someone in my

22:09.913 --> 22:11.329
friend group to notice

22:11.330 --> 22:13.228
and take into account

22:13.229 --> 22:15.126
the fact that I was,

22:16.460 --> 22:17.628
I was hurting

22:20.006 --> 22:21.215
pretty bad.

22:22.967 --> 22:24.259
- People had seen it before.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.385
They just didn't do anything.

22:26.386 --> 22:28.221
- How did that make you feel?

22:28.222 --> 22:29.597
- I was kind of glad.

22:29.598 --> 22:30.723
I was just like, see?

22:30.724 --> 22:32.058
I know they don't care.

22:32.059 --> 22:33.559
It was this thing in my head.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.062
- It was this constant
- game in my head

22:35.065 --> 22:36.689
- Of who cares and -
who doesn't care.

22:36.692 --> 22:37.878
And so when someone

22:37.879 --> 22:39.065
saw something

22:39.066 --> 22:40.650
and didn't do anything about it,

22:40.651 --> 22:42.486
- I was like, okay, -
that's another reason

22:42.489 --> 22:43.904
- I don't want to live is -
because they don't care.

22:43.907 --> 22:45.404
- I just wanted people to see

22:45.405 --> 22:46.448
that this is what

22:46.449 --> 22:47.490
I was turning to

22:47.491 --> 22:49.556
since I didn't

22:49.557 --> 22:51.619
have anything else.

22:51.620 --> 22:52.955
- I saw teens with

22:52.956 --> 22:54.289
cuts on their wrists,

22:54.290 --> 22:56.541
so I wasn't shocked by it.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.647
But I never realized

22:57.648 --> 22:58.751
that this was a sign

22:58.752 --> 23:00.963
of such intense pain.

23:03.674 --> 23:06.134
She used to cut herself

23:06.135 --> 23:07.719
and I knew that.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.576
And, I mean, a lot

23:09.577 --> 23:11.430
of people knew that.

23:11.431 --> 23:12.850
- And I mean, she had
- it on her wrist,

23:12.853 --> 23:14.352
And everybody,

23:16.020 --> 23:18.189
everybody could see it.

23:23.610 --> 23:26.863
- I treat them with

23:26.864 --> 23:28.740
a lot of compassion

23:28.741 --> 23:31.911
because it's my past self.

23:34.121 --> 23:36.289
It's like a story on my skin.

23:36.290 --> 23:38.541
It's like a tattoo almost.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.106
And I feel like they're

23:40.107 --> 23:41.670
kind of battle scars.

23:43.797 --> 23:45.799
Because I know that

23:46.675 --> 23:48.718
I'm a survivor

23:48.719 --> 23:50.492
of something really,

23:50.493 --> 23:52.264
really devastating

23:52.265 --> 23:54.100
to a lot of people.

23:57.728 --> 23:59.604
In China, when I was born,

23:59.605 --> 24:01.711
my parents left me on

24:01.712 --> 24:03.817
the side of the road.

24:05.527 --> 24:07.154
- Either they couldn't
- take care of me

24:07.157 --> 24:09.739
Or they had to get rid of me

24:09.740 --> 24:12.785
as a way to avoid consequences.

24:15.329 --> 24:18.707
So I was adopted at six months.

24:28.717 --> 24:30.240
Life at home through

24:30.241 --> 24:31.761
all that time

24:31.762 --> 24:34.513
was perfectly normal

24:34.514 --> 24:35.954
and I don't remember

24:35.955 --> 24:37.392
ever thinking

24:37.393 --> 24:39.144
that I didn't like my parents

24:39.145 --> 24:42.105
or I didn't want to be there.

24:42.106 --> 24:43.649
I loved my parents

24:43.650 --> 24:45.191
and it was really

24:45.192 --> 24:47.257
easy for me to believe

24:47.258 --> 24:49.321
that it was normal

24:49.322 --> 24:51.261
to be adopted and

24:51.262 --> 24:53.199
normal to have parents

24:53.200 --> 24:55.160
that didn't look like you,

24:55.161 --> 24:56.493
and for people to ask, hey,

24:56.494 --> 24:58.434
you don't look

24:58.435 --> 25:00.373
like your parents.

25:00.374 --> 25:02.606
All of a sudden one day I

25:02.607 --> 25:04.836
just started thinking that

25:04.837 --> 25:07.713
this isn't normal.

25:07.714 --> 25:09.716
I really wish I could

25:09.717 --> 25:11.718
be like other kids and

25:13.511 --> 25:15.596
I started thinking, oh,

25:15.597 --> 25:18.224
I wish that I could

25:18.225 --> 25:21.060
be with my birth parents.

25:21.061 --> 25:23.043
And I was around, I

25:23.044 --> 25:25.024
want to say sixth grade.

25:27.567 --> 25:30.820
I remember being really

25:30.821 --> 25:32.573
depressed after my

25:32.574 --> 25:34.324
friend in middle school

25:34.325 --> 25:37.494
left during seventh grade.

25:37.495 --> 25:39.121
I was so confused

25:40.414 --> 25:43.250
with what the raw emotion was

25:45.044 --> 25:47.463
that I couldn't find any

25:47.464 --> 25:49.881
other way to bring myself back

25:49.882 --> 25:52.218
other than self-harming.

25:53.677 --> 25:54.928
- I - learned that self-harm

25:54.931 --> 25:56.553
Isn't just about cutting.

25:56.554 --> 25:57.639
There are other ways

25:57.640 --> 25:58.723
teens hurt themselves,

25:58.724 --> 25:59.913
like drinking, drug

25:59.914 --> 26:01.100
use, and abusing

26:01.101 --> 26:02.749
the hook-up culture

26:02.750 --> 26:04.397
of high school.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.088
Drinking and drug use is

26:08.089 --> 26:09.692
common in high school,

26:09.693 --> 26:12.237
and hooking up isn't shocking.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.863
But when I think about it,

26:13.864 --> 26:15.449
some teens took these

26:15.450 --> 26:17.033
to another level.

26:17.034 --> 26:18.786
Getting black out

26:18.787 --> 26:20.537
drunk numerous times or

26:20.538 --> 26:22.540
smoking pot every day

26:22.541 --> 26:24.541
or using other drugs.

26:24.542 --> 26:26.419
Or even hooking up all the

26:26.420 --> 26:28.294
time with the wrong people.

26:28.295 --> 26:30.485
These can all be signs

26:30.486 --> 26:32.674
that someone needs help.

26:35.428 --> 26:36.575
- My best friend

26:36.576 --> 26:37.720
told my counselor

26:37.721 --> 26:39.264
that she was worried about me.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.558
- My middle school -
counselor pulled me

26:40.561 --> 26:42.225
Into her office one day.

26:42.226 --> 26:43.685
- She was like, "Lauren,
- I'm worried about you."

26:43.688 --> 26:45.396
- And I was like, -
oh, what's wrong?

26:45.399 --> 26:46.730
- And she's like, "Someone's
- afraid that you're

26:46.733 --> 26:47.897
"gonna kill yourself."

26:47.898 --> 26:48.815
And I was like, what?

26:48.816 --> 26:50.191
That's crazy.

26:50.192 --> 26:51.859
But really I was like, oh shit.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.236
Like I actually, like

26:53.237 --> 26:54.611
someone actually knows.

26:54.612 --> 26:56.322
And I was really scared

26:56.323 --> 26:57.846
and I was scared

26:57.847 --> 26:59.367
because I was actually

26:59.368 --> 27:01.245
gonna commit suicide that week.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.374
- Suicide for me was

27:05.375 --> 27:06.541
like a way for people

27:06.542 --> 27:08.251
to hear me.

27:08.252 --> 27:10.170
- I think that happens
- for a lot of kids,

27:10.173 --> 27:11.630
Is they feel

27:11.631 --> 27:13.089
misunderstood or they feel

27:13.090 --> 27:14.673
isolated and alone,

27:14.674 --> 27:16.468
maybe based on something

27:16.469 --> 27:18.261
they've done or

27:18.262 --> 27:20.346
just depression in general

27:20.347 --> 27:21.806
and feeling like they can't talk

27:21.807 --> 27:23.682
to anyone about it.

27:23.683 --> 27:25.957
And it's, I mean, it is a

27:25.958 --> 27:28.229
cry for help in some ways.

27:28.230 --> 27:30.941
It's the biggest cry for help.

27:34.612 --> 27:36.322
- I just didn't really

27:36.323 --> 27:38.030
see myself living anymore.

27:38.031 --> 27:39.053
I started to write

27:39.054 --> 27:40.074
letters and things

27:40.075 --> 27:41.243
just kind of to

27:41.244 --> 27:42.410
almost ease my mind,

27:42.411 --> 27:44.037
but at the same time

27:44.038 --> 27:45.662
I was in preparation

27:45.663 --> 27:47.457
for something to come,

27:47.458 --> 27:49.251
- because I just felt that -
there was no possible way

27:49.254 --> 27:50.627
I was gonna finish this year.

27:50.628 --> 27:52.044
There was just no way.

27:52.045 --> 27:54.006
- One night things
- just got too bad

27:54.009 --> 27:55.591
And I just decided that it

27:55.592 --> 27:57.175
just wasn't worth it anymore

27:57.176 --> 27:59.595
and I wanted to attempt suicide.

28:01.639 --> 28:03.557
- Basically what was -
going through my head

28:03.560 --> 28:05.059
Was just a whole lot

28:05.060 --> 28:06.559
of negative thinking.

28:06.560 --> 28:07.726
You're a failure.

28:07.727 --> 28:09.228
You've got no one.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.564
Why stick around?

28:11.565 --> 28:12.649
All of a sudden this

28:12.650 --> 28:13.732
wave just hits me

28:13.733 --> 28:16.693
and it's just like, wow.

28:16.694 --> 28:17.736
I really could.

28:17.737 --> 28:19.696
I could, couldn't I?

28:19.697 --> 28:21.449
I could do it.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.515
It basically took all my

28:23.516 --> 28:25.578
willpower to just stop

28:25.579 --> 28:27.123
myself from going

28:27.124 --> 28:28.665
and grabbing my belt

28:28.666 --> 28:30.376
or whatever else.

28:33.629 --> 28:34.818
You know, string myself

28:34.819 --> 28:36.006
up on my chin up bar.

28:39.510 --> 28:41.303
- I was really

28:41.304 --> 28:43.096
single-minded that day.

28:44.598 --> 28:45.641
I was set from the

28:45.642 --> 28:46.683
moment I got off

28:46.684 --> 28:49.352
the school bus, I was ready

28:49.353 --> 28:51.689
to just give up my life.

28:52.939 --> 28:56.609
And it was

28:56.610 --> 28:58.069
consuming.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.654
The thought of

28:59.655 --> 29:01.531
I'm gonna do this.

29:01.532 --> 29:02.992
- When suicide was

29:02.993 --> 29:04.450
a thought on my mind,

29:04.451 --> 29:05.536
it was,

29:06.704 --> 29:09.205
it was just,

29:09.206 --> 29:10.623
like an abyss.

29:10.624 --> 29:12.418
- It felt like it -
just never ended.

29:12.421 --> 29:13.876
It felt like just a black hole

29:13.877 --> 29:15.379
sucking me in.

29:16.714 --> 29:18.631
My parents got divorced,

29:18.632 --> 29:20.134
I had a family friend who took

29:20.135 --> 29:21.634
care of me for a lot of it.

29:21.635 --> 29:23.887
And I was sexually abused

29:23.888 --> 29:26.139
by that family friend.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.767
It wasn't like one time.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.977
It was ongoing.

29:31.978 --> 29:33.730
He instilled fear in me.

29:33.731 --> 29:35.065
- He told me he'd kill my -
parents if I told anyone

29:35.068 --> 29:38.651
And he told me he'd hurt me.

29:38.652 --> 29:39.987
That's not something you

29:39.988 --> 29:41.320
can share with your friends,

29:41.321 --> 29:42.927
and especially as

29:42.928 --> 29:44.532
a six-year-old.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.368
- It started to affect
- me during the time

29:46.371 --> 29:47.910
I was going into high school.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.788
- You're like 13, you're
- going to be a freshman

29:49.791 --> 29:50.996
In high school.

29:50.997 --> 29:52.707
Sexuality is a new thing.

29:52.708 --> 29:54.043
And that was the time

29:54.044 --> 29:55.376
when all the memories

29:55.377 --> 29:57.379
were flooding back.

30:01.258 --> 30:02.593
- If - you only knew Helene

30:02.596 --> 30:04.427
Through her social media,

30:04.428 --> 30:06.055
you'd think she's one of

30:06.056 --> 30:07.680
those girls that has it all.

30:07.681 --> 30:09.183
She's a model, has

30:09.184 --> 30:10.683
so many friends,

30:10.684 --> 30:12.415
a boyfriend, has a

30:12.416 --> 30:14.145
ton of followers,

30:14.146 --> 30:16.439
and gets so many Likes.

30:16.440 --> 30:17.587
- It's a hard thing

30:17.588 --> 30:18.733
to talk about now.

30:18.734 --> 30:20.090
And that's the problem

30:20.091 --> 30:21.444
is because these things

30:21.445 --> 30:22.903
that are hard to talk about,

30:22.904 --> 30:24.656
you don't end up talking about.

30:24.657 --> 30:25.658
And then they just

30:25.659 --> 30:26.659
fester inside.

30:26.660 --> 30:28.515
And that's really created

30:28.516 --> 30:30.369
this sense of depression

30:30.370 --> 30:32.539
and feeling isolated.

30:37.294 --> 30:38.919
- I was 14 years old.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.214
I was dating a guy

30:40.215 --> 30:41.506
that was 19 years old

30:41.507 --> 30:44.717
and he did not treat me well.

30:44.718 --> 30:46.157
But I still got the

30:46.158 --> 30:47.595
attention from him

30:47.596 --> 30:49.014
that I needed, that

30:49.015 --> 30:50.431
I thought I needed

30:50.432 --> 30:53.267
to feel like I mattered.

30:53.268 --> 30:54.812
- I felt like I was -
important when I was

30:54.815 --> 30:56.979
In the relationship with him.

30:56.980 --> 30:58.169
And when that ended

30:58.170 --> 30:59.357
and when I didn't have

30:59.358 --> 31:01.256
any friends there

31:01.257 --> 31:03.152
for me to back me up,

31:03.153 --> 31:04.696
I felt like I wasn't

31:04.697 --> 31:06.238
important anymore.

31:06.239 --> 31:07.407
And I felt like it

31:07.408 --> 31:08.574
wouldn't really matter

31:08.575 --> 31:11.077
if I wasn't here anyways.

31:14.748 --> 31:16.730
The last time that I

31:16.731 --> 31:18.711
attempted suicide was

31:20.337 --> 31:21.714
one month ago.

31:23.799 --> 31:25.342
I just never thought I

31:25.343 --> 31:26.884
was gonna be good enough

31:26.885 --> 31:28.344
and I just thought that that was

31:28.345 --> 31:29.868
the best thing to

31:29.869 --> 31:31.389
do in that time.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.308
- I started thinking
- about my parents

31:33.311 --> 31:35.957
And I started thinking

31:35.958 --> 31:38.605
about you and this video.

31:40.691 --> 31:41.734
Sorry.

31:53.453 --> 31:56.997
- I had to make friendships

31:56.998 --> 31:59.021
and I felt like I couldn't

31:59.022 --> 32:01.043
talk about my depression if

32:01.044 --> 32:02.545
I was trying to make friends,

32:02.546 --> 32:04.214
- like who wants to
- talk about like,

32:04.217 --> 32:05.278
That's not a conversation

32:05.279 --> 32:06.340
that you make

32:06.341 --> 32:07.572
with people when you're

32:07.573 --> 32:08.801
trying to make friends.

32:08.802 --> 32:10.033
This topic with my own

32:10.034 --> 32:11.262
parents I felt like,

32:11.263 --> 32:12.890
- oh, I don't want to
- make them feel bad.

32:12.893 --> 32:14.432
I don't want to talk about it.

32:14.433 --> 32:15.768
- And I don't want -
to tell my friends.

32:15.771 --> 32:17.309
What are they gonna think?

32:17.310 --> 32:18.562
- Like, oh, they're -
gonna have to be so

32:18.565 --> 32:19.937
Sensitive around me.

32:19.938 --> 32:23.482
So it created problems.

32:23.483 --> 32:24.610
I mean, we all go

32:24.611 --> 32:25.735
about our days smiling

32:25.736 --> 32:27.654
- and posting pictures
- on Instagram.

32:27.657 --> 32:29.281
Everyone's smiling, happy,

32:29.282 --> 32:30.907
and it's so one-sided.

32:30.908 --> 32:32.785
Like you have no idea

32:32.786 --> 32:34.660
what's going on beyond that.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.455
- We all - have
this image we put

32:36.458 --> 32:38.499
Up on Facebook, on

32:38.500 --> 32:40.541
Instagram, on Snapchat.

32:40.542 --> 32:42.273
We're smiling,

32:42.274 --> 32:44.002
laughing in every shot.

32:44.003 --> 32:45.401
We're doing this,

32:45.402 --> 32:46.798
we're going here.

32:46.799 --> 32:49.926
Hanging out with these people.

32:49.927 --> 32:52.512
And our lives look perfect.

32:55.474 --> 32:56.475
- Social media actually

32:56.476 --> 32:57.476
did have a really

32:57.477 --> 32:59.644
negative impact in my life.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.396
- There was just a -
group message with

33:01.399 --> 33:02.877
A lot of guys that were

33:02.878 --> 33:04.356
from my middle school

33:04.357 --> 33:05.984
and somehow the

33:05.985 --> 33:07.610
conversation started

33:07.611 --> 33:08.967
going towards me and

33:08.968 --> 33:10.321
people were calling me gay,

33:10.322 --> 33:12.573
and when I wasn't out yet.

33:12.574 --> 33:14.242
- They were just -
making assumptions,

33:14.245 --> 33:15.869
- But basically to cut
- me down they were

33:15.872 --> 33:17.100
Calling me gay or

33:17.101 --> 33:18.329
fag or whatever.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.394
And a lot of negative

33:19.395 --> 33:20.456
stuff just came,

33:20.457 --> 33:24.543
was amplified over Facebook.

33:24.544 --> 33:26.630
So I definitely think social

33:26.631 --> 33:28.714
media has a role to play

33:28.715 --> 33:30.863
in depression and also

33:30.864 --> 33:33.010
in just name-calling

33:33.011 --> 33:35.722
and unhealthy communication.

33:41.478 --> 33:43.105
- Someone can say anything

33:43.106 --> 33:44.730
to you on social media

33:44.731 --> 33:46.337
and they're not

33:46.338 --> 33:47.943
gonna see you cry.

33:49.945 --> 33:52.239
- A major point of anxiety

33:52.240 --> 33:54.533
for me was social media.

33:56.242 --> 33:57.348
It was Facebook

33:57.349 --> 33:58.452
and it was Tumblr,

33:58.453 --> 33:59.726
and it was basically

33:59.727 --> 34:00.997
just this constant

34:00.998 --> 34:02.916
need for connection.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.585
- Because social media is so new

34:06.586 --> 34:08.463
- to this generation and
- it's like we really

34:08.466 --> 34:09.485
Don't understand the full

34:09.485 --> 34:10.505
psychological effects

34:10.507 --> 34:12.299
it has on all of us.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.135
- The thing about -
social media is there's

34:14.138 --> 34:15.803
Such expectations around it.

34:15.804 --> 34:17.556
- Like if you don't have -
this amount of followers

34:17.559 --> 34:19.431
- Or this amount of -
friends on Facebook,

34:19.435 --> 34:20.538
Or I didn't get this

34:20.539 --> 34:21.641
many Likes on my photo.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.291
There's just like,

34:23.292 --> 34:24.937
you internalize it

34:24.938 --> 34:26.899
- and you think, wow, -
that means maybe I'm not

34:26.902 --> 34:28.900
- Good enough and these
- people don't care.

34:28.904 --> 34:30.860
- And I think it's -
psychologically damaging

34:30.864 --> 34:32.070
To people sometimes

34:32.071 --> 34:33.277
'cause it's just hard

34:33.279 --> 34:35.239
- 'cause you feel so
- alone with that.

34:35.243 --> 34:36.617
- It does make you

34:36.618 --> 34:37.992
feel very envious

34:37.993 --> 34:39.786
- and kind of isolated
- whenever you see

34:39.789 --> 34:40.891
All your friends

34:40.893 --> 34:41.996
at a party that you

34:41.996 --> 34:44.873
weren't invited to.

34:44.875 --> 34:46.083
- I thought that, people

34:46.085 --> 34:47.292
thought that I was having fun

34:47.293 --> 34:49.253
and that was good.

34:49.254 --> 34:50.485
I didn't want people

34:50.485 --> 34:51.714
to know how upset

34:51.715 --> 34:54.842
I was at times or how,

34:54.842 --> 34:55.928
how little fun I

34:55.929 --> 34:57.011
was actually having.

34:57.012 --> 34:58.222
- All social media is is

34:58.223 --> 34:59.430
connecting with other people,

34:59.431 --> 35:02.016
but for me and for a lot of us,

35:02.017 --> 35:04.374
it's so hard to feel

35:04.375 --> 35:06.730
connected, really connected.

35:11.276 --> 35:13.007
- But then that's

35:13.008 --> 35:14.738
why we lose people.

35:18.825 --> 35:20.118
- So you - were in the hospital

35:20.121 --> 35:21.828
Because you attempted?

35:23.288 --> 35:24.831
- When I woke up

35:24.832 --> 35:26.374
in the ICU, I was,

35:27.417 --> 35:29.209
I was really sad.

35:29.210 --> 35:30.983
I was, I saw my parents

35:30.984 --> 35:32.755
in the corner of the room

35:32.756 --> 35:33.882
and I blinked for

35:33.883 --> 35:35.007
a couple seconds,

35:35.008 --> 35:36.697
and then I just,

35:36.698 --> 35:38.386
I started crying.

35:39.721 --> 35:45.350
I was like, whoa, I almost died.

35:45.351 --> 35:49.314
I was, I almost wasn't here.

35:53.526 --> 35:54.882
- When the worst part

35:54.883 --> 35:56.236
of it all was going on,

35:56.237 --> 35:58.280
I didn't really tell anyone.

35:58.281 --> 35:59.658
I knew I shouldn't

35:59.659 --> 36:01.033
take my own life,

36:01.034 --> 36:02.557
but at the same time

36:02.558 --> 36:04.078
when people would talk

36:04.079 --> 36:05.914
- about college or -
what I wanted to be

36:05.917 --> 36:07.582
When I grew up, I didn't

36:07.583 --> 36:09.249
really think of anything.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.003
- I'd known for -
awhile that I should

36:11.006 --> 36:12.129
Really say something

36:12.130 --> 36:13.253
because I couldn't

36:13.254 --> 36:15.965
stop these feelings on my own.

36:15.966 --> 36:17.426
One night be and my mom

36:17.427 --> 36:18.884
were walking our dog,

36:18.885 --> 36:20.552
and it was over the summer,

36:20.553 --> 36:21.742
and I just got up the

36:21.743 --> 36:22.930
courage to just say,

36:22.931 --> 36:24.558
I don't, I think

36:24.559 --> 36:26.184
I need some help.

36:27.936 --> 36:30.105
- Well, I first started -
seeing the school psychologist

36:30.108 --> 36:31.294
And I actually, this was

36:31.295 --> 36:32.481
before my parents found out,

36:32.482 --> 36:34.025
I started going by myself.

36:34.026 --> 36:35.861
- So I reached out for
- help 'cause I just

36:35.864 --> 36:37.112
Decided someone should

36:37.113 --> 36:38.362
be able to help me.

36:38.363 --> 36:40.198
- Like this is not -
something I should

36:40.201 --> 36:42.117
- Have to go through alone,
- so I'll give it a shot.

36:42.120 --> 36:44.326
- At first it's awkward.

36:44.327 --> 36:45.953
You can't say it's not.

36:45.954 --> 36:47.539
- Like sitting here -
and telling someone

36:47.542 --> 36:48.770
Something that is

36:48.771 --> 36:49.999
so rooted in you

36:50.000 --> 36:51.543
and personal to you is

36:51.544 --> 36:53.085
the hardest thing ever.

36:53.086 --> 36:54.880
But after a while, you

36:54.881 --> 36:56.672
just feel so much lighter.

36:56.673 --> 36:57.799
It's like this huge

36:57.800 --> 36:58.924
relief to finally

36:58.925 --> 37:00.364
be able to sit there and

37:00.365 --> 37:01.802
tell someone how you feel

37:01.803 --> 37:03.993
and get help for it

37:03.994 --> 37:06.182
rather than constantly

37:06.183 --> 37:07.851
drowning yourself.

37:12.064 --> 37:13.086
- Each

37:13.087 --> 37:14.106
individual has his or her

37:14.107 --> 37:15.651
own method for healing and

37:15.652 --> 37:17.193
for staying mentally healthy.

37:17.194 --> 37:20.112
There is no single solution.

37:20.113 --> 37:21.719
Feelings of extreme

37:21.720 --> 37:23.323
sadness, fatigue,

37:23.324 --> 37:25.243
anxiety, depression,

37:26.411 --> 37:28.621
can and should be treated.

37:33.835 --> 37:35.293
- I can advocate for myself.

37:35.294 --> 37:36.962
I've learned how to do that.

37:36.963 --> 37:38.528
How to just socially

37:38.529 --> 37:40.091
interact in general.

37:40.092 --> 37:41.594
'Cause on of the main

37:41.595 --> 37:43.094
struggles that I had

37:43.095 --> 37:44.617
that I actually hadn't

37:44.618 --> 37:46.138
realized for a long time,

37:46.139 --> 37:47.286
and it was actually, I

37:47.287 --> 37:48.432
was diagnosed with it

37:48.433 --> 37:52.394
while I was at school,

37:52.395 --> 37:54.272
is NLD, which is Non-Verbal

37:54.273 --> 37:56.148
Learning Disorder.

37:56.149 --> 37:58.255
Knowing that you have

37:58.256 --> 38:00.360
control over the situation,

38:00.361 --> 38:03.488
it's incredibly empowering.

38:03.489 --> 38:05.450
- Your parents wanted to -
put you in therapy, right?

38:05.453 --> 38:06.992
- Yeah.

38:06.993 --> 38:08.537
- So let's talk about

38:08.538 --> 38:10.079
that resistance,

38:10.080 --> 38:11.706
- that you didn't -
really want to go

38:11.709 --> 38:13.332
- And just your -
journey with therapy.

38:13.335 --> 38:14.833
- Yeah, I was just like,

38:14.834 --> 38:16.128
- I'll do it because
- they say it works

38:16.131 --> 38:17.335
And if it doesn't work,

38:17.336 --> 38:18.462
then it won't work for me.

38:18.463 --> 38:19.463
- And so it does.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.006
- It does.

38:21.007 --> 38:22.801
- Therapy changed my - life.

38:22.804 --> 38:24.426
And I got on medication.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.887
I was on Prozac and I was really

38:26.888 --> 38:28.513
hesitant about it at first,

38:28.514 --> 38:29.995
but they're like, you're

38:29.996 --> 38:31.475
in a deep, bottom pit.

38:31.476 --> 38:32.851
You're at the very bottom of it

38:32.852 --> 38:34.728
and that's exactly how I felt.

38:34.729 --> 38:36.481
And they're like, Prozac

38:36.482 --> 38:38.232
will lift you up a little.

38:38.233 --> 38:39.818
And so you can start working

38:39.819 --> 38:41.401
on the skills in therapy.

38:41.402 --> 38:42.987
It wasn't just talking.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.739
- I would learn skills -
to do and things to do

38:44.742 --> 38:45.991
When I was upset

38:45.992 --> 38:47.241
or felt impulsive.

38:47.242 --> 38:48.326
We worked on skills

38:48.327 --> 38:49.409
like distraction

38:49.410 --> 38:51.453
and distressed tolerance

38:51.454 --> 38:52.580
and especially

38:52.581 --> 38:53.705
radical acceptance,

38:53.706 --> 38:55.250
'cause that's

38:55.251 --> 38:56.792
about understanding

38:56.793 --> 38:58.024
that things sometimes

38:58.025 --> 38:59.253
can just suck in life,

38:59.254 --> 39:00.818
but you have to

39:00.819 --> 39:02.380
come to accept it

39:02.381 --> 39:04.091
because that's the way life is

39:04.092 --> 39:05.802
- and you have to learn
- to work around it

39:05.805 --> 39:07.720
- And work with it which
- is really important.

39:07.723 --> 39:09.681
- It's like a combination of
- things that work together.

39:09.684 --> 39:10.703
It just all came

39:10.704 --> 39:11.723
together perfectly.

39:11.724 --> 39:13.267
I was really lucky.

39:13.268 --> 39:14.749
- I'm in a lot of

39:14.750 --> 39:16.228
therapy right now

39:16.229 --> 39:18.294
and I have a psychiatrist

39:18.295 --> 39:20.357
and everything like that

39:20.358 --> 39:22.047
trying to figure out medications

39:22.048 --> 39:23.735
and that kind of thing

39:23.736 --> 39:26.197
for my depression.

39:26.198 --> 39:27.407
I can definitely

39:27.408 --> 39:28.615
say there are days

39:28.616 --> 39:29.701
when I wake up and

39:29.702 --> 39:30.784
I feel really happy

39:30.785 --> 39:32.245
and I feel like I can

39:32.246 --> 39:33.704
do whatever I want.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.978
I can achieve goals

39:35.979 --> 39:38.250
in life, you know?

39:38.251 --> 39:40.212
- Well, my therapist
- has helped me feel

39:40.215 --> 39:41.567
A lot more open about

39:41.568 --> 39:42.921
what I'm feeling,

39:42.922 --> 39:44.612
and I've just really

39:44.613 --> 39:46.300
learned to listen

39:46.301 --> 39:48.365
to myself and what

39:48.366 --> 39:50.429
makes me happy and not,

39:51.931 --> 39:53.120
I don't know, or if

39:53.121 --> 39:54.308
I'm having a bad day,

39:54.309 --> 39:56.019
just like step back

39:56.020 --> 39:57.728
and do something I know

39:57.729 --> 39:59.251
will make me happy

39:59.252 --> 40:00.772
and clear my head.

40:00.773 --> 40:02.400
- Therapy and yoga

40:02.401 --> 40:04.026
and meditation

40:04.027 --> 40:05.736
has really been an outlet,

40:05.737 --> 40:07.197
but it took me being able

40:07.198 --> 40:08.655
to stand up for myself

40:08.656 --> 40:10.304
in order to cut that

40:10.305 --> 40:11.950
post-traumatic stress

40:11.951 --> 40:15.037
and constant depression.

40:15.038 --> 40:16.435
- From therapy I've

40:16.436 --> 40:17.831
learned a lot of skills.

40:17.832 --> 40:20.064
I'm doing DBT, which is

40:20.065 --> 40:22.294
Dialectical Behavior Therapy.

40:22.295 --> 40:23.943
Validation is really,

40:23.944 --> 40:25.589
really especially helpful

40:25.590 --> 40:27.925
when you're talking to someone

40:27.926 --> 40:29.615
who's in need of

40:29.616 --> 40:31.303
someone to listen.

40:31.304 --> 40:33.972
It's really,

40:33.973 --> 40:35.308
it's really good

40:35.309 --> 40:36.641
to hear someone say

40:36.642 --> 40:38.102
I'm gonna try to understand

40:38.103 --> 40:39.811
and I'm gonna listen to you.

40:39.812 --> 40:41.689
- When you talk about
- how you got better,

40:41.692 --> 40:43.482
- What was some of the -
things that made you better

40:43.485 --> 40:45.277
- And what are some of -
the things you use now?

40:45.280 --> 40:47.027
- Got involved in marching band.

40:47.028 --> 40:48.572
Sounds really, really

40:48.573 --> 40:50.114
dorky and geeky and stuff,

40:50.115 --> 40:52.366
but it gave me a team,

40:52.367 --> 40:54.327
- gave me a really -
good group of friends

40:54.330 --> 40:55.850
That were kind of just as

40:55.851 --> 40:57.371
dorky and geeky as I was.

40:57.372 --> 40:58.602
- So I think finding

40:58.603 --> 40:59.831
something that you feel

40:59.832 --> 41:01.959
like this is why I was born,

41:01.960 --> 41:04.336
this is what I was meant to do,

41:04.337 --> 41:05.964
really brought me

41:05.965 --> 41:07.589
out of this hole

41:07.590 --> 41:09.341
that I had dug myself in.

41:09.342 --> 41:10.760
- I think connecting

41:10.761 --> 41:12.177
with my spiritual self

41:12.178 --> 41:13.555
was really what

41:13.556 --> 41:14.930
started to make things

41:14.931 --> 41:16.890
go uphill for me.

41:16.891 --> 41:18.559
- That was a big part
- of me coming out.

41:18.562 --> 41:20.228
- Through meditation
- I got more connected

41:20.231 --> 41:21.292
With my emotions

41:21.293 --> 41:22.354
and I was more able

41:22.355 --> 41:23.627
to process a lot of

41:23.628 --> 41:24.898
thoughts and feelings

41:24.899 --> 41:25.963
that were going on

41:25.964 --> 41:27.025
in my head just by

41:27.026 --> 41:29.153
pausing from life almost,

41:29.154 --> 41:30.239
sitting down, and just

41:30.240 --> 41:31.322
breathing in and out,

41:31.323 --> 41:33.158
and just experiencing

41:33.159 --> 41:34.992
the present moment.

41:34.993 --> 41:37.078
- I love the outdoors.

41:38.288 --> 41:39.811
It's something

41:39.812 --> 41:41.332
I've always loved.

41:41.333 --> 41:42.918
It's just the sense

41:42.919 --> 41:44.501
of timelessness.

41:44.502 --> 41:45.961
I just love everything about it.

41:45.962 --> 41:49.465
Even the sense of peace

41:49.466 --> 41:51.633
that you get from

41:51.634 --> 41:54.386
a place like this.

41:54.387 --> 41:55.430
- We need to

41:55.431 --> 41:56.472
break down the barriers

41:56.473 --> 41:58.349
surrounding mental health

41:58.350 --> 42:00.081
and talk about how

42:00.082 --> 42:01.810
we're really feeling.

42:01.811 --> 42:03.167
Not just what we

42:03.168 --> 42:04.521
show on social media,

42:04.522 --> 42:08.108
in our pictures, or over texts.

42:08.109 --> 42:10.653
We need to deeply connect.

42:14.657 --> 42:17.034
These brave teens got help

42:17.035 --> 42:18.744
and have a future.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.187
- It's crazy 'cause

42:23.188 --> 42:24.333
just a short while ago

42:24.334 --> 42:25.377
I was picturing me

42:25.378 --> 42:26.418
not even being here,

42:26.419 --> 42:28.254
- and now I have -
this whole plan of

42:28.257 --> 42:29.505
How I want to live my life.

42:29.506 --> 42:31.048
I want to be on Survivor,

42:31.049 --> 42:32.550
- like the reality -
show or something.

42:32.553 --> 42:33.800
I just want to do crazy things.

42:33.801 --> 42:35.427
And I want to go to college

42:35.428 --> 42:37.013
- and I want to have -
kids and get married.

42:37.016 --> 42:38.890
- And now I can aspire
- to those things

42:38.893 --> 42:40.433
And work for them

42:40.434 --> 42:41.975
because I'm in a place

42:41.976 --> 42:43.727
where I can do that.

42:43.728 --> 42:45.646
- Actually I think the
- most important thing

42:45.649 --> 42:49.066
To me right now is my future.

42:49.067 --> 42:52.110
I know exactly what I wanna do.

42:52.111 --> 42:53.321
Yeah, I'm gonna go

42:53.322 --> 42:54.530
to Davis and get

42:54.531 --> 42:56.323
a masters in biology.

42:56.324 --> 42:57.616
- I'm gonna do all this -
stuff and rent an apartment

42:57.619 --> 43:00.494
And like, I don't know.

43:00.495 --> 43:02.454
It's all fantasies,

43:02.455 --> 43:04.707
but it makes me feel

43:04.708 --> 43:06.958
really happy to know that

43:06.959 --> 43:09.420
I'm gonna be something someday.

43:09.421 --> 43:12.130
And I'm gonna make a difference.

43:12.131 --> 43:13.612
- Writing is like my

43:13.613 --> 43:15.092
thing, it's my passion.

43:15.093 --> 43:16.240
Being able to realize

43:16.241 --> 43:17.386
that I'm good at it

43:17.387 --> 43:18.680
and I can continue with it

43:18.681 --> 43:19.971
for the rest of my life,

43:19.972 --> 43:23.225
I credit everything to that.

43:23.226 --> 43:25.227
- If you knew of somebody

43:25.228 --> 43:26.895
or were talking to somebody

43:26.896 --> 43:28.856
- or even if this could
- be shown to somebody

43:28.859 --> 43:30.815
Who was thinking about suicide,

43:30.816 --> 43:32.068
what would you want

43:32.069 --> 43:33.318
to say to them?

43:33.319 --> 43:35.405
- That whatever you are

43:35.406 --> 43:37.489
dealing with right now,

43:37.490 --> 43:39.034
even though it's so hard

43:39.035 --> 43:40.576
to think that it won't,

43:40.577 --> 43:42.244
it will get better.

43:42.245 --> 43:44.496
- Whatever you're stuck in,

43:44.497 --> 43:45.957
there is definitely

43:45.958 --> 43:47.416
going to be change,

43:47.417 --> 43:49.251
no matter what you think.

43:49.252 --> 43:50.337
- If you ask for help and

43:50.338 --> 43:51.420
you reach out to people,

43:51.421 --> 43:52.735
it will get better and

43:52.736 --> 43:54.047
you will get over it

43:54.048 --> 43:55.924
and you will one day be happy.

43:55.925 --> 43:57.135
- Well, I think that

43:57.136 --> 43:58.343
it's really important

43:58.344 --> 43:59.804
to understand that

43:59.805 --> 44:01.263
you're not alone

44:01.264 --> 44:02.932
- and it's really important
- to see that there

44:02.935 --> 44:03.996
Are so many people

44:03.997 --> 44:05.058
who've been able to

44:05.059 --> 44:07.352
overcome those feelings.

44:07.353 --> 44:08.480
- This is something

44:08.481 --> 44:09.605
that you can treat

44:09.606 --> 44:10.939
and you can cure.

44:10.940 --> 44:12.732
That you can live a happy life.

44:12.733 --> 44:14.527
- It's just you have to -
deal with the real illness

44:14.530 --> 44:16.278
That's going on.

44:16.279 --> 44:17.822
- Find someone who does
- know how to help you

44:17.825 --> 44:19.906
Because, you know,

44:19.907 --> 44:21.659
it could be your friends, it

44:21.660 --> 44:23.410
could be your friend's parents,

44:23.411 --> 44:25.996
it could be your parents.

44:25.997 --> 44:28.332
Just let someone in.

44:28.333 --> 44:29.959
- Teenager's friends are
- gonna be the first one

44:29.962 --> 44:31.377
- To notice if -
something's different

44:31.380 --> 44:33.295
Or something's not right.

44:33.296 --> 44:35.215
They should take

44:35.216 --> 44:37.132
action and speak up.

44:37.133 --> 44:38.697
'Cause they might just

44:38.698 --> 44:40.260
save someone's life.

44:40.261 --> 44:42.054
- Sometimes it's hard -
to reach out and get

44:42.057 --> 44:43.681
- Help on your own and -
you need someone else

44:43.684 --> 44:45.266
- To do it for you and
- I think it's important

44:45.269 --> 44:47.018
- That if you notice
- it in a friend,

44:47.021 --> 44:48.560
You should talk to them.

44:48.561 --> 44:49.750
Then you should go

44:49.751 --> 44:50.937
get help for them.

44:50.938 --> 44:52.772
- Because we're so young,

44:52.773 --> 44:54.067
that's why we're so susceptible

44:54.068 --> 44:55.359
to these thoughts, too,

44:55.360 --> 44:56.361
is because we haven't

44:56.362 --> 44:57.362
had the life experience

44:57.363 --> 44:59.571
to show us that there's more.

44:59.572 --> 45:00.928
And we just have to have

45:00.929 --> 45:02.282
faith that there is more.

45:02.283 --> 45:03.513
- Everyone suffers

45:03.514 --> 45:04.742
and everyone gets sad.

45:04.743 --> 45:06.037
And some people get depressed,

45:06.038 --> 45:07.329
some more than others,

45:07.330 --> 45:08.665
but we all struggle

45:08.666 --> 45:09.998
with the same thing,

45:09.999 --> 45:11.167
and through that

45:11.168 --> 45:12.334
struggling we could all

45:12.335 --> 45:14.149
kind of bask in that

45:14.150 --> 45:15.962
we're all in this together

45:15.963 --> 45:17.131
and we're all kind

45:17.132 --> 45:18.298
of one in a way

45:18.299 --> 45:19.947
and we don't need

45:19.948 --> 45:21.593
to feel so alone.

45:21.594 --> 45:23.471
- I wish we'd - had
these conversations

45:23.474 --> 45:25.723
Before so I could've

45:25.724 --> 45:27.974
helped my friend.

45:27.975 --> 45:29.726
- If you think you -
or a friend may be

45:29.729 --> 45:31.208
Suffering from depression

45:31.209 --> 45:32.688
or having thoughts

45:32.689 --> 45:35.399
of suicide, don't wait.

45:35.400 --> 45:36.484
Get help.

45:41.136 --> 45:42.364

like reckless behavior,

45:43.909 --> 45:45.450
personality changes,

45:45.451 --> 45:48.370
changes in sleep, physical pain,

45:48.371 --> 45:50.038
or substance abuse,

45:50.039 --> 45:52.667
step in or speak up.

45:55.253 --> 45:57.130
You do not have to be suicidal

45:57.131 --> 45:59.005
to use these resources.

45:59.006 --> 46:00.967
You can just reach out

46:00.968 --> 46:02.927
and get information.
