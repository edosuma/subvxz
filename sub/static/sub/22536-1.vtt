WEBVTT

00:05.830 --> 00:08.230
(helicopter blades whirring)

00:16.640 --> 00:18.107
God help me.

00:18.110 --> 00:20.305
Woman:
Mr. Roth!

00:20.320 --> 00:22.914
Mr. Roth!

00:24.020 --> 00:25.339
Here to arrest me?

00:25.350 --> 00:27.784
Why? What have you done?

00:31.360 --> 00:33.225
Anton, we're at school.

00:33.230 --> 00:35.221
Do you know astronauts
can't cry in space

00:35.230 --> 00:36.527
Because there's no gravity?

00:36.530 --> 00:38.691
I
do
know that.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.361
Anton, we're here.

00:41.900 --> 00:43.788
Indeed we are.

00:49.980 --> 00:54.576
people working every night
and day

00:54.580 --> 00:56.468
never give yourself no time

00:56.490 --> 01:00.745
got too many bills to pay

01:00.760 --> 01:03.320
slow down

01:03.330 --> 01:06.322
Woman:
Remember, our corporate oﬁ‘ices
are in new york

01:06.330 --> 01:08.059
If you need anything.

01:08.060 --> 01:09.994
And, uh, I programmed
the jensens' number

01:10.000 --> 01:11.820
Into your phone.
(laughs)

01:11.830 --> 01:13.866
We're working with
homes for human kind

01:13.870 --> 01:15.531
To build houses in new york.

01:15.540 --> 01:17.758
I don't think I'm
gonna need the
corporate offices

01:17.770 --> 01:19.704
Or the jensens' phone number,

01:19.710 --> 01:21.075
But thank you.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.775
I'm your mother, amber.
I get to worry.

01:22.780 --> 01:24.771
Now, what are the three b's?

01:24.780 --> 01:27.749
You are aware that I'm 16?

01:27.750 --> 01:29.217
I make my executives say it,

01:29.220 --> 01:31.347
And they are a lot older
than you.
(laughs)

01:31.350 --> 01:35.116
Be careful, be smart,

01:35.120 --> 01:37.657
Be curious.

01:40.060 --> 01:41.425
Woman:
Do you have enough money?

01:41.430 --> 01:44.092
I'm fine, mom.
Here.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.898
Take this.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.959
I'm fine, mom, really.

01:49.970 --> 01:51.198
Ian?_
Yes, mrs. Gibson?

01:51.210 --> 01:52.438
Will you take this $20

01:52.440 --> 01:54.067
And spend it on
my daughter, please?

01:54.080 --> 01:55.707
Sure thing, mrs. Gibson.

01:55.710 --> 01:58.440
What? She's my elder.
I'm respecting her elderness.

01:59.780 --> 02:01.372
Beth ann,
isn't that your father?

02:03.720 --> 02:05.779
Both:
What the hell is he doing here?

02:05.790 --> 02:08.281
Man:
I’m afraid there is nothing
I can do about that

02:08.290 --> 02:11.555
I arranged to be
the chaperone on
this school trip,

02:11.560 --> 02:12.754
And they're counting on me.

02:12.760 --> 02:13.886
Beth ann,
they're counting on me.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.219
Oh, so now suddenly
you care

02:15.230 --> 02:16.788
That someone is actually
counting on you?

02:16.800 --> 02:17.892
Listen, this school gives us
generous tuition support.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.322
The least I can do
is help out when I can.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.921
You are embarrassing
your daughter!

02:20.940 --> 02:22.237
You see that,
don't you, francis?

02:22.240 --> 02:24.060
I only get her one weekend
a month.

02:24.070 --> 02:26.334
And, beth ann, it's my weekend.
I only get you one weekend...

02:26.340 --> 02:28.069
And she doesn't
talk to you then.
Enough.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.104
Enough.

02:29.110 --> 02:30.600
You get on the bus,

02:30.610 --> 02:31.975
You don't talk to me,

02:31.980 --> 02:33.971
You don't look at me.

02:35.980 --> 02:38.141
You, I'll see you
in a few days.

02:38.150 --> 02:39.947
you don't even need to try

02:39.960 --> 02:43.088
gotta get up,
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

02:43.090 --> 02:44.819
listen to me,
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

02:44.830 --> 02:46.286
clappa your hands

02:46.300 --> 02:47.824
Boy:
Agent hurst?

02:47.830 --> 02:48.922
Yes, kyle?

02:48.930 --> 02:50.852
Who's this guy?

02:50.870 --> 02:52.929
This is agent
marcus finley.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.464
Agent finley,
this is kyle devore.

02:54.470 --> 02:55.994
Pleased to meet you, kyle.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.466
Where is valens?

02:57.470 --> 03:00.200
Agent valens is sick.
He's got the flu.

03:00.210 --> 03:01.871
This is agent finley's first
inner perimeter assignment.

03:01.880 --> 03:04.474
But you'd take a bullet
for me, right?

03:04.480 --> 03:06.004
I was trained_
to protect your life.

03:06.020 --> 03:07.976
I wouldn't be here if I weren't.

03:07.980 --> 03:11.245
Well, welcome to brat patrol.

03:12.020 --> 03:14.818
oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

03:14.820 --> 03:17.288
No signal.

03:17.290 --> 03:19.087
No signal.

03:21.330 --> 03:23.298
No signal.

03:24.170 --> 03:26.866
(device trills)
signal.

03:26.870 --> 03:28.462
(beeping)

03:31.140 --> 03:32.505
Mark it here, please.

03:32.510 --> 03:34.239
So much for nationwide
coverage, huh?

03:34.240 --> 03:38.040
Yeah, no one's
getting a message
out of here today.

03:39.580 --> 03:43.812
gotta get up,
oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

03:43.820 --> 03:46.141
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

03:46.160 --> 03:49.186
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

03:49.190 --> 03:51.329
gotta get up,
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

03:51.330 --> 03:53.321
listen to me

03:53.330 --> 03:54.752
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

03:54.760 --> 03:57.593
clappa your hands

03:57.600 --> 04:01.434
stompa your feet...

04:01.440 --> 04:03.089
Boys:
hail to the chief's son

04:03.110 --> 04:05.670
he takes his dumps
on air force one.

04:05.670 --> 04:07.604
Oh, yeah. That's great.
That's great, luke. Thanks.

04:07.610 --> 04:11.068
Okay, okay, now that were
all here, let us go.

04:15.250 --> 04:17.275
I want to thank you
for putting me in
the car today.

04:17.290 --> 04:20.544
I've been standing outer
perimeter for the
last 18 months.

04:36.740 --> 04:38.469
So, you want to get
on amber fitch?

04:39.610 --> 04:41.635
Everyone
wants
to get on amber fitch.

04:41.640 --> 04:44.575
Damn, sometimes
I
want to get on amber fitch.

04:44.580 --> 04:48.072
I'd sketch that, but I'd-I'd
probably have to watch.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.479
For perspective.

04:49.490 --> 04:52.141
The thing is, ian,
people like us?

04:52.150 --> 04:53.788
We're invisible to amber fitch.

04:53.790 --> 04:56.782
Oh, it's-it's just one
at a time in there.

04:56.790 --> 04:58.655
I don't think so, mr. Gibson.

05:01.430 --> 05:02.897
(lock clicks)

05:07.400 --> 05:09.436
They're stopping for lunch soon.

05:09.440 --> 05:12.102
Send the lead car up ahead
to secure the restaurant.

05:12.110 --> 05:14.135
Copy that.

05:14.140 --> 05:16.836
Mob/7e 7 to mob/7e 8.
Go for 8.

05:16.850 --> 05:20.069
Mo ve aheao;
secure the restaurant
Copy-

05:27.260 --> 05:29.148
Ian, I've been thinking.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.788
What if I didn't come
back from new york?

05:31.790 --> 05:33.826
What's to come
back here for?

05:33.830 --> 05:35.525
I brought all

05:35.530 --> 05:38.124
My birthday money, $381.

05:38.130 --> 05:39.961
Come with me.

05:39.970 --> 05:42.859
Beth ann, are you being serious?

05:43.810 --> 05:47.007
No, just messing with you.

05:57.820 --> 05:59.640
Hello? What...

05:59.660 --> 06:01.480
Hello?

06:01.490 --> 06:04.516
Come on.

06:07.830 --> 06:10.219
What the hell?

06:17.410 --> 06:19.708
If the troopers have a roadblock
out here, we're supposed

06:19.710 --> 06:20.734
To be informed.

06:20.740 --> 06:22.628
Yes, we are.

06:29.820 --> 06:31.412
(brakes hissing)

06:33.720 --> 06:35.915
(indistinct radio transmission)

06:41.500 --> 06:45.266
We're United States
secret servnce agents.

06:45.270 --> 06:47.864
We have a protectee
on that bus.

06:47.870 --> 06:51.431
I'm gonna reach inside my jacket
and get my identification now.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.431
We know who you are.
We talked to the agents

06:53.440 --> 06:54.771
In that other suv.

06:54.780 --> 06:56.771
We got a downed power line
up the road.

06:56.780 --> 06:59.749
So I'm gonna have to ask you to
hold up here for a little while.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.513
Why didn't the
other car radio us?

07:01.520 --> 07:04.785
You spoke to the other agents
in person or over the radio?

07:09.220 --> 07:10.482
Movement!

07:11.860 --> 07:14.226
Hurst?

07:14.230 --> 07:15.527
(gasps, exclaiming)

07:15.530 --> 07:17.122
(grunts, coughs)

07:21.640 --> 07:23.767
(exhales)

07:26.610 --> 07:29.704
Worst first day ever,
huh, bitch?

07:30.710 --> 07:32.109
Open the door!

07:36.880 --> 07:39.440
In 15 seconds,
a truck is going to pull up.

07:39.460 --> 07:42.258
You all are going to get off
this bus and onto that truck.

07:42.260 --> 07:44.922
Anyone who does anything
different from that

07:44.930 --> 07:47.626
Will end up like that
man out there.

07:47.630 --> 07:48.551
Man: You have room!

07:48.560 --> 07:50.653
Keep coming!

07:50.670 --> 07:51.659
Come on! Up!

07:51.670 --> 07:52.921
Come on, come on, come on.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.464
Let's go.

07:55.270 --> 07:58.660
Hurry up!
Let's go! Move!

07:58.670 --> 08:00.467
Get in the truck!

08:04.650 --> 08:07.175
Man:
Move!

08:09.450 --> 08:12.283
Get up front!

08:12.290 --> 08:14.042
On both sides!

08:19.360 --> 08:21.180
Let's go, let's go!

08:25.630 --> 08:27.427
Keep moving!
Move.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.533
Get on the truck! Go!

08:33.170 --> 08:36.879
Hey, kid, let's go.
Time to move.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.701
On your feet.
What'd I tell you?!

08:49.220 --> 08:51.211
Which one was it?

08:51.230 --> 08:54.825
That little fat one.

08:54.830 --> 08:57.651
Anton roth. We need that one.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.865
I need you to handle it.

09:16.580 --> 09:18.047
Sit down!

09:28.600 --> 09:30.818
You have to run.
I can't run.

09:30.830 --> 09:31.899
You have to run faster!

09:31.900 --> 09:34.323
This is as fast as I run.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.864
I have a very short stride.

09:35.870 --> 09:38.338
And you have to stop crying.
What's your name?

09:38.340 --> 09:39.932
Anton.

09:39.940 --> 09:41.737
You have to stop crying, anton.
That sound will carry.

09:41.740 --> 09:43.571
I can't stop crying
because I'm afraid,

09:43.580 --> 09:47.277
And telling me why I have to
stop only makes me more afraid.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.441
Man:
And the secret service agents?

09:49.450 --> 09:51.589
Two still missing.
This one, albert hurst,

09:51.590 --> 09:53.114
Been with the secret service
18 years.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.747
Guy's a legend
in the service.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.853
Runs the protective detail
for the president's son.

09:56.860 --> 09:59.351
He put this man,
agent marcus finley,

09:59.360 --> 10:01.123
A rookie, in his car
this morning.

10:01.130 --> 10:03.519
Hurst rerouted the bus
just before departure.

10:03.530 --> 10:05.691
Sentthelead
secret service suv ahead

10:05.700 --> 10:06.962
Just before the attack.

10:06.970 --> 10:08.790
Then two minutes after
the attack,

10:08.800 --> 10:12.099
Called in an "all okay"
to secret service dispatch.

10:12.110 --> 10:13.907
So, hurst worked this
from the inside.

10:13.910 --> 10:15.468
And maybe
the rookie, too.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.129
We lock secret service
out of this investigation.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.777
Give them nothing.

10:18.780 --> 10:22.477
I can brief the president.
I want you out at the school.

10:22.480 --> 10:23.617
We're getting
the parents together.

10:23.620 --> 10:25.144
And I want you on that.

10:25.150 --> 10:26.617
Your_master of the _universe
Sister IS there, right?

10:26.620 --> 10:28.759
Her daughter was on
that bus and...

10:28.760 --> 10:30.648
And I don't want to hear any
"you're too emotionally close

10:30.660 --> 10:31.820
To do your job clearly" crap

10:31.830 --> 10:34.151
Because your niece
is on that bus.

10:34.160 --> 10:35.889
Those parents out there
don't respect authority

10:38.130 --> 10:40.269
We need them to open up,
and your sister

10:40.270 --> 10:41.464
Gives us access.

10:41.470 --> 10:43.267
We're not on speaking terms,
sir.

10:43.270 --> 10:45.659
Now you are. That's an order.

10:45.670 --> 10:48.161
Man (over p.A.):
The president will be up
in ten seconds.

10:48.180 --> 10:50.978
This is_a secure
communication link.

10:57.790 --> 11:00.042
Francis:
Beth ann.

11:00.820 --> 11:03.084
Francis:
Beth ann.

11:03.090 --> 11:06.025
Beth ann.

11:07.760 --> 11:10.058
There you go.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.022
You're okay.

11:17.940 --> 11:19.498
I think they gave us

11:19.510 --> 11:21.466
Some sort of
traanIlizer,

11:21.480 --> 11:23.675
But the effect's wearing off.

11:23.680 --> 11:24.874
It's okay.
You're okay.

11:24.880 --> 11:27.098
Where's ian?

11:29.020 --> 11:31.375
Man:
Hey, everybody here?

11:31.390 --> 11:32.687
Amber:
No.

11:32.690 --> 11:34.043
Anton is missing.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.709
Why would they
take anton?

11:35.720 --> 11:36.982
They didn't.

11:36.990 --> 11:38.150
That man who was shot took him.

11:38.160 --> 11:39.525
We were already on the truck,

11:39.530 --> 11:40.679
But I saw him take anton.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.055
Finley.
The new guy.

11:44.670 --> 11:46.228
Hurst shot finley.

11:46.230 --> 11:47.697
He just shot him.

11:47.700 --> 11:49.565
That is so
messed up.

11:49.570 --> 11:51.663
All right, let's just
try to stay calm.
Luke:
Stay calm?

11:51.670 --> 11:53.661
My mouth hurts.
Luke:
Dude, are you at all aware

11:53.680 --> 11:55.329
Of what's going on?

11:55.340 --> 11:57.808
The guy who's supposed
to protect kyle

11:57.810 --> 12:00.574
Shot the other guy who's
supposed to protect lqle.

12:00.580 --> 12:01.672
Then we got dosed.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.069
Does anyone else's mouth hurt?

12:04.090 --> 12:05.148
Mr. Nash is right, luke.

12:05.150 --> 12:06.412
Panic isn't gonna help anyone.

12:06.420 --> 12:08.342
Okay, I think
you can stop

12:08.360 --> 12:09.713
Being president
of the class now.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.880
Does anyone
else's mouth hurt?

12:14.530 --> 12:15.952
Oh, my god.

12:18.670 --> 12:19.762
Mr. Nash,

12:19.770 --> 12:21.089
What did they
do to us?

12:21.100 --> 12:22.738
Please, let's try to stay calm.

12:22.740 --> 12:24.935
F' that.
I'm out of here.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.319
(anton grunts)

12:53.770 --> 12:55.192
Shh...

13:03.910 --> 13:06.549
(quietly):
You did really good, anton.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.776
No signal.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.042
We gotta find
a clearing.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.386
Read.

13:15.390 --> 13:16.812
Out loud.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.727
"this will all be over soon.

13:26.740 --> 13:28.128
"no one will be hurt.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.664
"if there are any
special dietary needs,

13:29.670 --> 13:32.559
"please speak up.
You may use

13:32.570 --> 13:34.606
"any of the rooms on
the first floor of this house.

13:34.610 --> 13:36.407
"the doors and windows have been
sealed and alarmed,

13:36.410 --> 13:38.469
"and the rooms are monitored
and your phones have been taken.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.300
"you may gather in groups

13:40.320 --> 13:42.845
"of no more than five people.

13:42.850 --> 13:44.317
Some of your parents
have had tracking..."

13:44.320 --> 13:46.481
(sighs)

13:46.490 --> 13:48.287
"some of your parents
have had tracking devices

13:48.290 --> 13:49.757
"implanted under your skin

13:49.760 --> 13:52.081
Or in your t... Teeth."

14:01.600 --> 14:02.760
Here.

14:02.770 --> 14:06.035
"we have removed these devices.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.600
"we tried to be
as careful as p055ible.

14:08.610 --> 14:11.101
"if you need something
for the pain,

14:11.110 --> 14:12.475
"please raise your hand

14:12.480 --> 14:14.368
"and something will
be brought to you.

14:14.380 --> 14:17.679
"as you can tell from
the way you were taken,

14:17.690 --> 14:19.282
"we are professionals.

14:19.290 --> 14:21.485
"if you do not respect that,

14:21.490 --> 14:23.651
"we are also very comfortable

14:23.660 --> 14:25.878
"with the use of force.

14:25.890 --> 14:29.098
Are there any questions?"

14:34.130 --> 14:36.928
Is there, um,
a bathroom I can use?

14:37.810 --> 14:40.028
I'm sorry.

14:43.240 --> 14:46.368
...That whoever is responsible
would have to have had access

14:46.380 --> 14:48.200
To inside information

14:48.220 --> 14:49.915
From within the secret service.
Ms. Fitch.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.069
Ms. Fitch.

14:51.090 --> 14:52.682
Yeah?

14:52.690 --> 14:54.089
We're nine minutes
from the school.

14:54.090 --> 14:56.251
The pilot is saying
that the airspace

14:56.260 --> 14:57.887
Has since been closed
to commerCIal traffic.

14:57.890 --> 14:58.857
What do you want to do?

14:58.860 --> 15:00.054
Put down on

15:00.060 --> 15:01.254
The soccer field I paid for.

15:01.260 --> 15:02.955
What are they gonna do,
shoot me?

15:04.930 --> 15:06.329
Are you going to die?

15:06.330 --> 15:07.729
No.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.230
How come it went
through the vest?

15:09.240 --> 15:10.867
There's a small
space on the Side

15:10.870 --> 15:13.202
In between the fasteners
where the bullet went.

15:13.210 --> 15:14.905
But my rib caught it.

15:14.910 --> 15:16.229
It's a lot of blood,
but it's nothing serious.

15:16.240 --> 15:17.605
Why did your partner shoot you?

15:18.880 --> 15:20.177
I don't know.

15:20.180 --> 15:21.772
Well, did he ever
do anything before

15:21.780 --> 15:23.338
To make you think he might
one day shoot you?

15:23.350 --> 15:25.170
Ijust met him
this morning.

15:25.190 --> 15:26.384
How old are you,
anyway?

15:26.390 --> 15:28.346
Twelve. I skipped
three grades.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.783
Why did you just meet
him this morning?

15:31.760 --> 15:33.523
This is my first day

15:33.530 --> 15:34.883
On kyle devore's detail.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.356
Whose were you on before that?

15:36.360 --> 15:38.021
No one's.
This is my first day

15:38.030 --> 15:39.099
On any detail.

15:39.100 --> 15:41.523
You're a newbie.

15:41.540 --> 15:42.939
There's a man

15:42.940 --> 15:44.293
Or men with guns

15:44.310 --> 15:45.538
Tracking us through the woods

15:45.540 --> 15:47.098
And you're a newbie.

15:47.110 --> 15:49.237
We're going to die, aren't we?
Listen.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.276
I'm a fully-trained
secret service agent.

15:51.280 --> 15:52.542
I was a d.C. Cop

15:52.550 --> 15:54.438
For three years
before that.

15:54.450 --> 15:56.077
You are not gonna die.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.274
I will get you home.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.485
Okay?

15:59.490 --> 16:01.287
Okay.

16:02.460 --> 16:04.280
(indistinct conversations)

16:04.290 --> 16:06.326
We now know from a highly-placed
source that the son

16:06.330 --> 16:08.127
Of the president
was on the bus...

16:08.130 --> 16:09.995
The son of the chinese
ambassador liao

16:10.000 --> 16:11.251
Was on that bus.

16:11.270 --> 16:13.830
(reporters continue
indistinctly)

16:13.840 --> 16:15.535
(helicopter blades whirring)

16:33.520 --> 16:36.182
Look, whatever's between us
is between us.

16:36.190 --> 16:37.452
Today, let's
just pretend

16:37.460 --> 16:39.257
Like we like each other.

16:39.260 --> 16:41.353
Or at the very least,
like I'm just a parent

16:41.360 --> 16:43.453
And you're just
an fbi agent.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.153
So what do you
need from me?

16:45.170 --> 16:46.922
To take me
into your world.

16:46.940 --> 16:48.794
Let's go.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.360
Is it true _that the
secret serwce agents
might be involved?

16:51.370 --> 16:52.598
I can't tell you that.

16:52.610 --> 16:54.862
Some of the parents
had gps trackers

16:54.880 --> 16:56.609
Implanted into
their children.

16:56.610 --> 16:58.271
The trackers
aren't responding.
What does that mean?

16:58.280 --> 16:59.599
It means
whoever did this

16:59.610 --> 17:01.805
Knows exactly
what they're doing.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.640
Now, look, susie.
All of these
people in here

17:03.650 --> 17:05.641
Are used to being
first in line.

17:05.650 --> 17:08.118
So get ready, because they're
all gonna want answers

17:08.120 --> 17:09.781
And there will be no line.

17:09.790 --> 17:11.348
I think I can handle it.

17:12.830 --> 17:14.320
(parents clamoring)
okay".

17:14.330 --> 17:17.151
We all understand
how distressing this is.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.990
Sir? Sir...

17:19.000 --> 17:21.218
(all talking at once)

17:31.080 --> 17:33.571
I know you need answers, but...

17:39.250 --> 17:41.912
(talking over each other)

17:43.260 --> 17:46.320
...As possible.
So I am gonna need you all to...

17:46.330 --> 17:47.922
We understand.
We understand

17:47.930 --> 17:49.818
How distressing this is...

17:49.830 --> 17:51.525
(voices begin to quiet)
...But we are here to help you

17:51.530 --> 17:53.418
And I can assure you that...

17:59.270 --> 18:01.101
Look, I know you all
have questions

18:01.110 --> 18:03.499
And I know you're used
to getting answers,

18:03.510 --> 18:06.240
But I have none for you.

18:06.250 --> 18:08.047
The agents you see
are passing out

18:08.050 --> 18:10.018
Recollection prompts.
Fill these out.

18:10.020 --> 18:11.612
Ma'a_m?
Su5ie:
They will help you remember

18:11.620 --> 18:12.882
Every phone call

18:12.890 --> 18:15.017
And text,
every conversation.

18:15.020 --> 18:17.386
The car behind you
at the light,

18:17.390 --> 18:20.188
The man next to you
at starbucks.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.553
The neighbors across
the street, the woman

18:21.560 --> 18:23.790
At your front door
selling magazines.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.018
Each of you will
have an fbi agent

18:26.030 --> 18:27.224
Assigned to you.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.889
If you have information

18:28.900 --> 18:30.868
That you believe to be relevant,
tell them now.

18:30.870 --> 18:34.408
If not, I need you
to start thinking

18:34.410 --> 18:36.469
And fill these out.
Thank you.

18:36.480 --> 18:40.473
We all know which kid
you want to find.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.641
He lives in that big house
on pennsylvania avenue.

18:42.650 --> 18:45.210
And I know this
recollection prompt

18:45.220 --> 18:46.642
Is crap.

18:52.590 --> 18:55.127
There's five here already.

18:55.930 --> 18:57.158
I can move.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.250
No, it's okay.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.158
Well, sure.

19:00.170 --> 19:03.264
Fine, th-that's okay.

19:03.270 --> 19:06.239
Jin:
We are going to die
because of him.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.333
He's the reason
they took us, right?

19:08.340 --> 19:09.898
And when his dad

19:09.910 --> 19:11.172
Sends the troops
to rescue him,

19:11.180 --> 19:13.102
Which one of us

19:13.110 --> 19:14.441
Do you think they're
going to make sure

19:14.450 --> 19:16.008
Gets out of
here alive?

19:16.020 --> 19:17.510
Perfect. They can put
"collateral damage"

19:17.520 --> 19:19.010
Under my
yearbook picture.

19:19.020 --> 19:21.284
You think this is
because of me, liao?

19:21.290 --> 19:22.848
I wasn't even
supposed to be here.

19:22.860 --> 19:25.488
My dad was going to
some summit in ireland.

19:25.490 --> 19:26.855
I was going with him.

19:26.860 --> 19:28.999
But it got cancelled
two days ago.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.491
You think you could put this
all together in two days?

19:31.500 --> 19:33.195
This house?

19:33.200 --> 19:35.293
Those cameras?

19:35.300 --> 19:37.029
What happened on that bus?

19:37.040 --> 19:38.189
In two
freakin' days?

19:38.210 --> 19:40.633
I don't know what

19:40.640 --> 19:42.005
This is about,

19:42.010 --> 19:43.432
But it isn't about me.

19:47.110 --> 19:49.374
(speaking low, indistinctly)

19:49.380 --> 19:51.541
You can go sit over there
if you want.

19:53.190 --> 19:54.384
Sorry.

19:54.390 --> 19:55.687
You don't have to be.

19:57.290 --> 19:58.882
I was just thinking
about amber's mom.

19:58.890 --> 20:01.279
That's just weird.
Come on, seriously.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.892
She's, what, like the ceo

20:02.900 --> 20:04.458
Of_ some billion-dollar
multinational corporation,

20:04.470 --> 20:06.222
Right?
Yeah.

20:06.230 --> 20:07.663
And her friend
sitting next to her,

20:07.670 --> 20:09.535
Her dad runs some
big company, too.

20:09.540 --> 20:11.132
His mom works
for the u.N.

20:11.140 --> 20:12.960
His dad's the captain

20:12.970 --> 20:14.403
Of some_aircraft
carrier.

20:14.410 --> 20:17.231
Her parents are actual royalty.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.138
Kyle isn't the only one

20:19.150 --> 20:21.004
With a powerful parent
with a kid worth taking.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.669
Yeah.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.671
Susie:
And your company--
any enemies there

20:24.690 --> 20:26.146
That might benefit from this?

20:26.150 --> 20:28.141
We are a multinational
it corporation.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.582
We sell to
governments,

20:29.590 --> 20:31.888
Armed forces and businesses
here and abroad.

20:31.890 --> 20:34.188
I have 350,000
employees.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.498
So to answer
your question,

20:36.500 --> 20:37.728
Yes, I have
enemies.

20:37.730 --> 20:39.391
Most everyone else
here does, too.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.561
Are you just gonna ask me
about my business, susie?

20:41.570 --> 20:43.162
That's how I do my job.

20:43.170 --> 20:45.365
Boy, you are tougher
than I remember.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.509
It's been a long time.

20:47.510 --> 20:49.330
Well, you're tougher than me.

20:49.340 --> 20:51.001
I'm not sure how much longer

20:51.010 --> 20:52.238
I can keep this up.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.002
Not today.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.578
Maybe one of us should
just say it, hmm?

20:55.580 --> 20:57.275
One of us
should just

20:57.290 --> 20:59.212
Say the words.

20:59.220 --> 21:02.041
Look, I know you
wrote that book,

21:02.060 --> 21:03.413
Seven paths to success,

21:03.420 --> 21:04.717
And I know that clarity
is one of them.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.254
So for clarity...

21:06.260 --> 21:09.354
I am here to find
your daughter, amber.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.759
To find all of their kids.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.625
That is why I'm here,
and I think...

21:13.640 --> 21:16.097
I think I should question
one of the other parents, okay?

21:16.100 --> 21:17.260
(phone ringing)

21:17.270 --> 21:18.464
I'll get you
a different agent.

21:18.470 --> 21:20.529
Excuse me.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.474
Yeah.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.471
Olsen:
Hey, we might've caught a break
with the parent chaperones.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.539
Francis gibson, he's ex-cia.
An analyst.

21:26.550 --> 21:28.279
A friend over there
checked his file for me

21:28.280 --> 21:29.918
And said that gibson

21:29.920 --> 21:32.548
Applied to go over to ops
but never made it through.

21:32.550 --> 21:33.881
Couldn't handle
the physical aspect,

21:33.890 --> 21:36.256
Which I'm guessing
means he was soft,

21:36.260 --> 21:38.410
But he's smart.
He knows the drill.

21:38.430 --> 21:39.988
He'll try to make contact, so...

21:39.990 --> 21:41.548
See what you can
find out about him.

21:41.560 --> 21:42.652
Got it.

21:42.660 --> 21:45.322
Francis gibson.
You know him?

21:46.770 --> 21:47.828
Yeah.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.262
He's a dad at school.

21:49.270 --> 21:50.498
Is he our hero?

21:50.510 --> 21:51.659
(quiet laugh)

21:51.670 --> 21:53.558
No way.

22:04.650 --> 22:07.483
You can be brave.

22:07.490 --> 22:09.458
You... You can be brave.

22:09.460 --> 22:11.849
You can be...
You can be brave.

22:11.860 --> 22:13.748
You can be...

22:15.500 --> 22:18.025
You can be brave.

22:18.030 --> 22:19.759
Mr. Nash?

22:19.770 --> 22:21.021
As long as today
might be our last,

22:21.040 --> 22:22.689
I got to tell you.

22:22.700 --> 22:25.430
That time you did ms. Kaley
in the locker room?

22:25.440 --> 22:27.635
I kind of saw you.

22:27.640 --> 22:29.437
I don't know what you're
talking about, luke.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.635
I'm talking about
the time you tapped

22:31.650 --> 22:33.504
The hot chem teacher.
Luke?

22:33.510 --> 22:35.341
What you saw...

22:35.350 --> 22:37.011
Adult emotions are...

22:37.020 --> 22:39.045
Complicated.

22:46.030 --> 22:48.681
Beth ann, listen.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.520
I have a plan.
A plan?

22:50.530 --> 22:52.521
What kind of plan?

22:52.530 --> 22:55.522
A plan to get you
out of here.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.292
I've been tracking them.

22:57.310 --> 22:59.505
One of them comes through
about every 90 minutes.

22:59.510 --> 23:01.239
He just walks through
and leaves.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.470
Beth ann, they've already
indentified me as weak.

23:03.480 --> 23:04.538
So they're not gonna be

23:04.550 --> 23:07.041
Expecting it.
Expecting what?

23:07.050 --> 23:09.371
For me to take his gun, and
hold the others off for a while.

23:09.380 --> 23:10.369
You need to get outside.

23:10.390 --> 23:11.470
The government will have

23:11.490 --> 23:13.082
Real-time satellites
tracking us.

23:13.090 --> 23:15.809
Group of kids on the lawn
will trigger a red flag.

23:15.820 --> 23:17.856
They will see you,
and they'll send help.

23:17.860 --> 23:19.418
That's crazy.
They'll kill you.

23:19.430 --> 23:20.829
Yes, but not you.

23:20.830 --> 23:23.025
For some reason,
they want you kids alive.

23:23.030 --> 23:24.395
For now.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.597
I don't want you
doing this for me.

23:31.040 --> 23:33.736
I remember the last time
you were happy.

23:35.410 --> 23:36.707
Your last birthday.

23:36.710 --> 23:38.473
Yeah, I was.

23:41.380 --> 23:43.769
After that,
all you did was make mom cry.

23:43.790 --> 23:47.647
Someday I hope you understand
what happened to our family.

23:49.190 --> 23:52.819
But now, just get everyone
on the lawn.

23:57.430 --> 23:59.193
Still no reception.

24:00.630 --> 24:04.088
We got to get higher.

24:19.420 --> 24:21.615
He's here.
We have to keep running.

24:21.620 --> 24:22.917
Out the back door,

24:22.920 --> 24:23.955
Into the woods.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.609
(grunting)

24:25.630 --> 24:28.428
No. No, we can't run.

24:28.430 --> 24:30.990
Even if we got a call out,
they'd never get here in time.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.423
I can run, I promise.
I'll run faster.

24:33.430 --> 24:34.966
I will.
I know you would.

24:34.970 --> 24:36.767
But that man out there is
the only connection

24:36.770 --> 24:38.089
To the people
who took your friends.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.408
They're not my friends, really.

24:40.410 --> 24:41.468
If we get away from him,

24:41.480 --> 24:42.799
That connection is gone.

24:42.810 --> 24:44.801
I_f rescue comes and
it scares him away,

24:44.810 --> 24:46.744
That connection is gone.

24:46.750 --> 24:49.275
But you promised to get me home.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.645
I will get you home, anton.

24:50.650 --> 24:51.969
But I need to get
the others home, too.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.912
So we need to take him.

24:53.920 --> 24:57.458
You're one of those people who
can will himself to do things.

24:57.460 --> 25:00.452
I go to school with a lot
of kids like that.

25:00.460 --> 25:01.586
I'm not one of those kids.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.921
Today you are.

25:46.710 --> 25:49.008
(yelling)

25:49.010 --> 25:51.501
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

25:51.510 --> 25:52.647
Aah!

25:52.650 --> 25:55.141
He broke the rules!

25:55.150 --> 25:57.209
(screaming)

26:04.220 --> 26:06.029
Beth ann!

26:06.030 --> 26:08.726
(yells, panting)

26:19.940 --> 26:22.101
Bring me my book.

26:23.580 --> 26:25.639
(grunts)

26:28.180 --> 26:30.410
You want a painkiller?

26:30.420 --> 26:31.842
No, I want an update.

26:31.850 --> 26:34.045
Reporter: Along with
the secret service suv

26:34.060 --> 26:35.743
That was part
of the protection detail.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.012
Why isn't your brother
back by now?

26:39.460 --> 26:41.553
Hey!

26:41.560 --> 26:43.596
I got a deal for you!

26:43.600 --> 26:45.727
Give me the kid
and I'll let you live!

26:45.730 --> 26:47.527
Or I come

26:47.540 --> 26:48.893
In there,

26:48.900 --> 26:51.095
Kill you,

26:51.110 --> 26:53.931
And take the kid anyway!

26:53.940 --> 26:55.703
Don't let him take me.

26:55.710 --> 26:56.734
I won't.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.230
He's going to come in here.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.399
I know. I'll stop him.

26:59.410 --> 27:00.604
You don't even have a gun!

27:00.620 --> 27:02.838
I don't even need one, anton.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.569
How about this instead?!

27:05.590 --> 27:08.582
I kill you, I keep this kid!

27:08.590 --> 27:10.114
Then I go and get

27:10.120 --> 27:11.815
The rest of his classmates back!

27:18.100 --> 27:20.227
All the parents are accounted
for except for morgan roth.

27:20.230 --> 27:22.095
His kid is anton.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.795
His wife hasn't heard from him.

27:23.800 --> 27:25.097
She's called,
but he won't pick up.

27:25.110 --> 27:26.304
He works _ _
at breakey communications.

27:26.310 --> 27:28.232
It's a satellite tv company.

27:28.240 --> 27:29.969
You would think
with his kid missing,

27:29.980 --> 27:31.971
He'd check in, right?

27:31.980 --> 27:34.744
Okay, morgan roth swiped
his keycard in

27:34.750 --> 27:36.911
At one of his company's remote
relay locations an hour ago.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.319
Never swiped out.

27:38.320 --> 27:41.084
I'm on my way there.

27:41.090 --> 27:43.513
I need to get
somewhere in a hurry,

27:43.520 --> 27:45.954
And... I could use your help.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.825
Do you have a lead?

27:48.930 --> 27:50.249
Right, you can't tell me.

27:50.260 --> 27:53.923
Um, my helicopter is
in the soccer field.

27:53.930 --> 27:55.466
Just tell the pilot
where you want to go.

27:55.470 --> 27:58.030
Thank you.
Susie?

27:58.040 --> 27:59.928
Do you remember the last
thing you said to me?

27:59.940 --> 28:02.431
I said...

28:02.440 --> 28:03.998
"go to hell."

28:04.010 --> 28:07.002
No, you said
something after that.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.848
It's smart.

28:11.850 --> 28:13.613
Putting his finger

28:13.620 --> 28:15.485
In ice like that, smart.

28:15.490 --> 28:17.981
It's what you put
on all of my assessments, right?

28:17.990 --> 28:19.878
That I'm smart.

28:20.830 --> 28:22.058
Ms. Kaley?

28:22.060 --> 28:24.494
Amber...
Yes.

28:24.500 --> 28:26.468
I heard what it is, mr. Nash.

28:26.470 --> 28:28.927
Adult emotions
are complicated.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.968
Turns out teenage ones are, too.

28:44.580 --> 28:46.389
How are you doing, beth ann?

28:47.850 --> 28:49.454
She won't talk.

28:57.600 --> 29:00.489
Reporter:
How can anyone hope
to get away with this?

29:00.500 --> 29:02.661
What agencies will be used?

29:02.670 --> 29:03.989
What resources?

29:04.000 --> 29:06.901
What hardware?
What technologies? Bob?

29:06.910 --> 29:09.162
The answer, richard,
is everyone and everything.

29:09.180 --> 29:10.932
Programs and technology
will be brought into play

29:10.950 --> 29:13.839
That up until this moment
had not been authorized for use

29:13.850 --> 29:15.203
On u.S. Soil.

29:15.220 --> 29:16.915
I can guarantee you
that somewhere...

29:16.920 --> 29:17.944
Boss?

29:17.950 --> 29:19.178
They do have something else

29:19.190 --> 29:20.418
In the air.

29:20.420 --> 29:21.717
It's seriously encrypted.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.689
Some type of surveillance
platform.

29:24.690 --> 29:26.180
I can't hack into it.
If it's looking for us,

29:26.190 --> 29:27.384
There's no way I can stop it.

29:27.390 --> 29:29.221
It's gonna lead the fbi

29:29.230 --> 29:30.219
Right to our door.

29:30.230 --> 29:31.299
Did we miss
a gps locator

29:31.300 --> 29:32.927
In any of those children?

29:32.930 --> 29:34.864
We were thorough,
but if it was small enough

29:34.870 --> 29:36.667
Or a low emissions
compOSIte, it's possmle.

29:43.710 --> 29:45.871
(indistinct radio transmission)

29:49.120 --> 29:52.476
I make 23 minutes
before they have a lock on us.

29:53.320 --> 29:54.389
Damn.

29:54.390 --> 29:55.448
That's right.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.950
$3 trillion spent

29:56.960 --> 29:58.757
On high-tech warfare
over the last decade.

29:58.760 --> 30:00.250
And now it's all aimed at you.

30:00.260 --> 30:02.728
Something in your book for that?

30:02.730 --> 30:04.254
What's your little girl
gonna think

30:04.270 --> 30:07.068
About her daddy
when he's sitting on death row?

30:08.840 --> 30:10.296
Maybe we should think
about getting out of here.

30:10.300 --> 30:13.007
Why would we think
about doing that?

30:13.010 --> 30:14.762
Amber:
Just tell her how her father is.

30:14.780 --> 30:17.499
Can you do that?

30:17.510 --> 30:20.638
Can you at least do that?

30:20.650 --> 30:21.844
Just come out here

30:21.850 --> 30:23.670
And tell mr. Gibson's daughter

30:23.680 --> 30:25.910
If her father's gonna be okay.

30:25.920 --> 30:29.310
Can you just be a human being?

30:29.320 --> 30:31.982
So which one are you,
mr. Gibson?

30:31.990 --> 30:34.254
The one I saw out
there desperate

30:34.260 --> 30:35.249
For his daughter's love?

30:35.260 --> 30:36.352
Or the one in here

30:36.360 --> 30:38.999
With that computation book?

30:39.000 --> 30:40.422
That's no concern of yours.

30:40.430 --> 30:43.035
What should concern you
is that my daughter

30:43.040 --> 30:44.632
Is not in here,

30:44.640 --> 30:46.267
And you are.

30:56.180 --> 30:58.341
(indistinct radio transmission)

30:59.520 --> 31:01.613
Surveillance drone
is close to a lock

31:01.620 --> 31:02.951
On that location, sir.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.212
I want hostage rescue
in the helicopters.

31:05.230 --> 31:06.686
I want the rotors turning.

31:06.690 --> 31:08.123
As soon as we get that location,

31:08.130 --> 31:10.189
They are good to go.

31:13.630 --> 31:15.063
22 minutes.

31:20.640 --> 31:21.868
There!

31:21.880 --> 31:24.405
He's over there.

31:28.380 --> 31:31.508
Man (voice altered):
Enter the code I've sent you
into the system.

31:31.520 --> 31:32.839
And what happens when I do?

31:32.850 --> 31:34.317
You will see your son again.

31:34.320 --> 31:36.709
They think that they
have control, mr. Roth.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.211
But they don't, not anymore.

31:39.230 --> 31:40.583
Push the button.

31:42.160 --> 31:44.253
Do it now.

31:45.400 --> 31:48.096
Push the button.

31:57.110 --> 31:59.032
Mr. Roth!

31:59.050 --> 32:00.403
Mr. Roth!

32:01.450 --> 32:03.338
You here to arrest me?

32:03.350 --> 32:06.114
Why? What have you done?

32:06.120 --> 32:08.111
I don't know.

32:21.970 --> 32:24.632
(gentle music plays,
low conversations)

32:26.140 --> 32:27.960
(people exclaiming)

32:29.280 --> 32:30.679
Did we get a location?

32:31.910 --> 32:33.446
No.

32:33.450 --> 32:35.475
Reporter:
The head of the nsa,

32:35.480 --> 32:39.143
The head of the national
council of...

32:44.890 --> 32:46.619
(door creaks)

32:49.400 --> 32:51.493
(muffled panting)

32:56.240 --> 32:58.299
(muffled panting)

33:17.190 --> 33:19.181
(muffled panting)

33:25.930 --> 33:28.023
(muffled panting over phone)

33:28.040 --> 33:29.735
Go, anton! Go now!

33:32.040 --> 33:33.837
(grunting)

33:36.940 --> 33:39.170
(gasping)

33:46.520 --> 33:49.614
(both grunting)

33:49.620 --> 33:51.383
Dude, what is your problem?!

33:51.390 --> 33:54.223
Why couldn't you just
lay on that road?!

33:55.290 --> 33:58.794
(marcus yelling)

34:05.840 --> 34:08.229
I'm from the ballard school.
Anton roth.

34:08.240 --> 34:09.502
I-I've been kidnapped.

34:09.510 --> 34:11.137
(gunshot)

34:26.490 --> 34:27.752
Did you get him?

34:27.760 --> 34:30.399
Yeah, I got him.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.095
911?
Mm-hmm.

34:32.100 --> 34:34.068
You tell them
who you are?

34:34.070 --> 34:35.526
Mm-hmm.

34:35.540 --> 34:37.394
Ithought
you weren't the type

34:37.400 --> 34:39.561
Of person who willed himself
to do things.

34:39.570 --> 34:41.106
Today, I guess I am.

34:41.110 --> 34:42.737
Hello?

34:42.740 --> 34:46.073
You tell the fbi_ that we're
gonna leave this line open

34:46.080 --> 34:50.176
So they can just go ahead
and track us to here.

34:50.180 --> 34:52.512
(grunts)

34:53.720 --> 34:56.245
I took this walkie
off that guy downstairs.

34:56.260 --> 34:57.511
I'm gonna have
a little chat

34:57.520 --> 34:58.680
With whoever's
on the other end.

34:58.690 --> 35:01.250
"whomever" is on
the other end.

35:01.260 --> 35:05.959
This is secret service agent
marcus finley speaking

35:05.970 --> 35:07.392
To whomever's listening.

35:07.400 --> 35:11.234
The man that you sent after us
is dead.

35:11.240 --> 35:14.539
You want to come for the body,
just follow this signal.

35:16.140 --> 35:20.042
Just before I killed him,
he asked me what my problem was.

35:20.050 --> 35:24.077
My problem is you took kids.
Children.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.548
What type of person does that?

35:26.550 --> 35:31.453
A bug. A bug that needs
to be stepped on and stopped.

35:31.460 --> 35:34.520
You're my problem,
and now I'm yours.

35:36.060 --> 35:39.223
He wasn't alive to hear
the answer to that question,

35:39.230 --> 35:40.993
But I thought you'd want
to know.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.491
If he killed my brother,

35:43.500 --> 35:46.901
I'm gonna make him hurt
before I kill him.

35:55.410 --> 35:58.208
Yes... I am a bug.

35:59.320 --> 36:01.709
I've always known
that about myself.

36:02.860 --> 36:06.489
But today... The bug is king.

36:15.300 --> 36:17.165
Who was on the phone, mr. Roth?

36:17.170 --> 36:19.263
Did they force
you to do this?

36:19.270 --> 36:21.431
You just took
out an unhackable
classified drone.

36:21.440 --> 36:24.307
Whoever is behind this
has our playbook

36:24.310 --> 36:28.098
And they are using it
against us.

36:28.120 --> 36:29.439
I need to know who that is.

36:29.450 --> 36:33.147
You kept these kids
from being found.

36:33.150 --> 36:35.015
Who was on the phone?

36:35.020 --> 36:38.353
(indistinct radio transmission)

36:38.360 --> 36:39.554
(helicopter blades whirring)

36:39.560 --> 36:42.028
They're coming.

36:42.030 --> 36:45.625
They're coming.
Finley, they're here.

36:45.630 --> 36:48.394
You did it.
You hear me?

36:48.400 --> 36:49.799
You did it.

36:49.800 --> 36:52.234
Finley?

36:55.210 --> 36:56.438
Finley?

36:58.710 --> 37:00.246
Hey...

37:02.920 --> 37:04.547
No matter what happens next,
anton,

37:04.550 --> 37:06.711
I don't want you
to worry about me.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.085
Why?

37:08.090 --> 37:10.388
What's gonna happen to you?

37:11.890 --> 37:15.348
Anton, I'm a secret service
agent

37:15.360 --> 37:18.352
And you lost
the president's kid.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.224
Reporter (on tv):
/Va va/ str/ire group three

37:20.230 --> 37:24.496
And its carrier the uss
jO/7/7 stenn/s
has been ordered

37:24.500 --> 37:26.604
To steam toward the east coast
of the United States.

37:26.610 --> 37:28.669
And we are now hearing
that very soon...

37:28.680 --> 37:31.240
(overlapping news reports)

37:34.750 --> 37:39.312
couldn't be much more
from the heart

37:40.350 --> 37:43.410
forever trusting who we are

37:43.420 --> 37:45.581
A|| aircraft carrier battle
groups have

37:45.590 --> 37:47.683
Been ordered onto high alert.

37:47.690 --> 37:50.124
Faa has just suspended all
commercial and nonessential...

37:50.130 --> 37:54.328
Man:
Everyone up the stairs!
Move it!

37:57.900 --> 38:01.404
never opened myself
this way

38:01.410 --> 38:03.731
For the time being,
there will be nothing in the slq

38:03.740 --> 38:05.378
That is not law enforcement.

38:05.380 --> 38:08.144
Financial markets have taken
a sharp downturn...

38:08.150 --> 38:10.948
(overlapping news reports)

38:10.950 --> 38:16.286
all these words
I don't just say

38:17.160 --> 38:22.257
and nothing else matters

38:22.260 --> 38:24.728
(indistinct chattering,
laughing)

38:24.730 --> 38:26.960
(doorbell rings)

38:26.970 --> 38:28.392
There he is.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.561
I wasn't sure _
you were gonna make it.

38:30.570 --> 38:32.458
We got a problem
back there, francis.

38:32.470 --> 38:34.836
We got a problem with
operation lennox.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.432
What? That wasn't supposed
to go yet.

38:36.440 --> 38:37.475
They're dead, francis.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.505
Who's dead?
A" of 'em.

38:39.510 --> 38:41.102
Men, women, children,

38:41.110 --> 38:43.943
Most of our guys.
It just got out of hand.

38:43.950 --> 38:45.349
I'm-I'm-I'm coming back in.

38:45.350 --> 38:47.238
You can't come in.

38:47.250 --> 38:48.945
I tried to keep you clean,
francis.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.484
I did everything I could, but...

38:50.490 --> 38:51.809
You gave the "go order."

38:51.830 --> 38:53.286
You signed off
on operation lennox.

38:53.290 --> 38:54.757
You know I didn't.

38:54.760 --> 38:57.092
I was against it.
I never put my name on that.

38:57.100 --> 38:59.660
How far do we go back, francis?
I'm beth ann's godfather.

38:59.670 --> 39:01.661
I'd be here watching her
unwrap presents

39:01.670 --> 39:03.262
If I didn't have to
clean up this mess.

39:03.270 --> 39:06.330
Clean it up by putting
that blood on me?

39:06.340 --> 39:07.807
I need to fight this.

39:07.810 --> 39:10.028
You need to look at
beth ann, francis.

39:10.040 --> 39:13.749
I have a sniper
on your daughter.

39:17.850 --> 39:20.512
You're my best friend.

39:20.520 --> 39:22.784
Say you understand, francis.

39:27.360 --> 39:29.487
open mind
I understand.

39:29.500 --> 39:33.869
for a different view

39:33.870 --> 39:37.863
and nothing else matters

39:39.310 --> 39:42.507
...Has gone home to be with
his wife as they pray

39:42.510 --> 39:44.398
For the safe return
of their daughter.

39:44.410 --> 39:49.746
never cared
for what they do

39:49.750 --> 39:54.540
never cared for what
they know

39:55.650 --> 39:56.981
Bad news?

39:56.990 --> 40:00.050
No. No, there's no news.

40:02.260 --> 40:04.490
I heard they found anton
and, uh,

40:04.500 --> 40:06.593
That secret service agent?

40:06.600 --> 40:08.761
Oh, I can't talk about that.

40:09.770 --> 40:12.398
Then why are you here?

40:12.410 --> 40:15.504
I saw something today.

40:15.510 --> 40:17.933
One of the parents did something
he never would have done

40:17.940 --> 40:19.669
Because he just wanted
to see his kid.

40:19.680 --> 40:22.376
I had to put a loving
father in handcuffs

40:22.380 --> 40:25.872
Because...

40:25.890 --> 40:28.643
He just wanted to see his kid.

40:30.720 --> 40:33.518
And you just want
to see your kid.

40:34.730 --> 40:39.724
I know I said
I never wanted to, but...

40:39.730 --> 40:42.927
Today...

40:42.940 --> 40:46.296
Now...

40:46.310 --> 40:47.937
I need to.

40:50.610 --> 40:55.946
all these words
I don't just say

40:58.480 --> 41:02.541
and nothing else matters

41:02.560 --> 41:04.778
You were that age
when you had her.

41:06.390 --> 41:09.052
I'm not sure
I was ever that young.

41:10.300 --> 41:13.827
trust I seek
and I find in you

41:13.830 --> 41:16.492
The last thing
I said to you was

41:16.500 --> 41:18.661
I asked you
to take care of her.

41:18.670 --> 41:21.798
every day, for us,
something new

41:21.810 --> 41:23.675
And I did.

41:25.610 --> 41:27.578
And now you bring her home.

41:27.580 --> 41:30.310
(phone ringing)

41:30.320 --> 41:33.175
and nothing else matters

41:33.190 --> 41:35.488
(ringing continues)

41:39.630 --> 41:45.353
never cared
for what they say

41:45.370 --> 41:48.760
(ringing becomes louder)

41:48.770 --> 41:52.638
never cared for games
they play

41:52.640 --> 41:54.301
Hello.

41:54.310 --> 41:56.266
Man (voice altered):
Meg fitch, if you want

41:56.280 --> 41:58.703
To see your amber again,
you will keep this call

41:58.710 --> 42:01.349
To yourself
and do as I tell you to.

42:01.350 --> 42:04.444
You need to ask yourself
right now:

42:04.450 --> 42:06.645
How far are you willing
to go?

42:06.650 --> 42:09.949
What will you do for your child?

42:13.630 --> 42:16.895
nothing else matters.

42:16.900 --> 42:19.255
