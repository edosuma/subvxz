Previous/)4”

00:03.000 --> 00:06.492
You are the nephew
of the widow Cameron of River Run.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.290
Are you familiar with her estate?

00:08.380 --> 00:10.211
I believe it's situated
on the Cape Fear River.

00:10.300 --> 00:11.585
[5/7 ’t he a handsome dog, Uncle?

00:11.680 --> 00:12.749
I named him Rollo.

00:12.840 --> 00:15.388
Claire and I have decided
to try and make a life here.

00:15.470 --> 00:16.459
In America?

00:16.550 --> 00:17.676
That's a fine idea.

00:17.760 --> 00:20.172
- Where will you settle?
- We don't know yet.

00:20.270 --> 00:22.761
We thought we would work that out
when we're visiting River Run.

00:22.850 --> 00:25.398
North Carolina offers
wealth and prosperity

00:25.480 --> 00:27.721
for those willing to persevere.

00:28.020 --> 00:29.430
There is a system of land grants.

00:29.900 --> 00:31.060
Do consider my offer.

00:31.150 --> 00:33.198
Mr Bonnet,
how many men have you killed?

00:33.280 --> 00:34.770
None that were not tryin'
to kill me first.

00:34.860 --> 00:35.861
You can go.

00:35.950 --> 00:37.986
Be wary. Travellers in these woods,

00:38.080 --> 00:40.196
they're often set upon
by thieves and outlaws.

00:41.790 --> 00:42.950
Pleasure to see you again.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.207
Sing me a song

00:50.300 --> 00:53.292
Ofa less that is gone

00:53.380 --> 00:56.008
Say, could that lass

00:56.090 --> 00:58.172
Be 1'?

00:58.810 --> 01:00.926
Merry of soul

01:01.020 --> 01:03.932
She sa/leo’ on a day

01:04.060 --> 01:06.267
Over the sea

01:06.350 --> 01:09.012
7'0 Skye

01:09.320 --> 01:11.777
[Wow and breeze

01:11.860 --> 01:14.397
Islands and seas

01:14.490 --> 01:19.109
Mountains of rain and sun

01:19.830 --> 01:22.196
All that was good

01:22.450 --> 01:24.907
All that was fair

01:25.000 --> 01:27.321
All that was me

01:27.420 --> 01:29.661
Is gone

01:30.300 --> 01:32.370
Sing me a song

01:32.460 --> 01:35.213
Of a lass that is gone

01:35.430 --> 01:37.671
Say, could that lass

01:37.760 --> 01:40.672
Be 1'?

01:40.760 --> 01:42.887
Merry of soul

01:42.970 --> 01:45.848
She sa/led on a day

Over the sea

01:49.940 --> 01:54.934
7'0 Skye

02:49.670 --> 02:52.036
Lesley deserved a decent burial,

02:53.670 --> 02:55.661
not a shallow grave on a riverbank.

02:56.130 --> 02:58.621
You can't blame yourself
for what happened.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.085
Who else, then?

03:01.890 --> 03:04.757
Did I not aid Bonnet
in his escape from the noose?

03:06.930 --> 03:08.511
I was a fool to trust him.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.477
We both trusted him.

03:12.900 --> 03:14.811
He played on our sympathies.

03:14.980 --> 03:17.687
Couldna defeat him
when it mattered most.

03:18.950 --> 03:20.440
Wasna able to protect you from him.

03:20.530 --> 03:24.489
You were outnumbered,
and they were armed to the teeth.

03:24.580 --> 03:26.445
Now, that may be the truth of it.

03:28.960 --> 03:32.077
And now that murderous bastard's
free to prey upon others,

03:33.000 --> 03:34.956
and that's my cross to bear.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.047
There she is, folks.

03:38.550 --> 03:39.915
River Run.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.596
Christ.

03:44.680 --> 03:46.250
Uncle Jamie!

03:46.350 --> 03:49.763
You dinna tell us Great-Aunt Jocasta
has a home befitting a king.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.595
Help us ashore, lad.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.856
Rollo, come.

04:02.570 --> 04:04.652
When we had coin and the gemstones,

04:05.160 --> 04:08.368
_ I was a man
WIth means of prOVIdIng, but...

04:10.080 --> 04:11.490
Now we're penniless.

04:16.710 --> 04:18.200
Wouldn't be the first time.

04:20.420 --> 04:23.173
You hadn't a shilling to your name
when we were first married.

04:25.350 --> 04:28.137
And I thought you only married me
for my wealth, Sassenach.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.220
Jocasta's family,

04:34.850 --> 04:37.728
and we're luclq we have relatives
we can turn to.

04:52.330 --> 04:53.319
Auntie.

04:55.540 --> 04:56.620
Jamie.

04:58.750 --> 05:00.627
Give us a hand with these, will ya?

05:02.170 --> 05:03.797
Welcome to River Run.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.137
Auntie Jocasta.

05:22.070 --> 05:26.689
Blessed Bride,
ye've grown to be a giant.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.441
That'll be the MacKenzie blood
flowing through ye.

05:29.910 --> 05:32.538
I was no more than a bairn
when last you saw me.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.246
Had nowhere to go but up.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.459
I recall ye had
a most gorgeous heid of red hair.

05:39.250 --> 05:41.206
How yer mother adored you.

05:41.550 --> 05:42.915
She adored you as well.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.716
Always spoke of you with love.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.968
I miss her, still.

05:48.050 --> 05:49.210
As do I.

05:51.850 --> 05:55.172
Auntie, may I present my wife, Claire?

05:57.690 --> 05:59.681
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mistress Cameron.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.021
I hope you'll call me Auntie, dear.

06:02.190 --> 06:03.680
We are kin, after all.

06:04.530 --> 06:05.690
Of course.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.525
Auntie it is, then.

06:08.240 --> 06:11.027
It is lovely to meet you, Claire.

06:13.120 --> 06:16.704
And this is your great-nephew,
Ian Murray, Jenny's youngest son.

06:16.790 --> 06:19.497
I'm very pleased to meet ye,
Great-Aunt Jocasta.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.740
Ye're welcome, lad.

06:23.960 --> 06:27.418
Your great-nephew has brought
a posy of flowers for you, mistress.

06:27.550 --> 06:28.676
Ooh.

06:29.550 --> 06:32.053
Thank ye kindly, Ian. Forgive me.

06:32.220 --> 06:35.053
It is a long time
since my sight has left me,

06:35.480 --> 06:37.880
though I still see shapes and shadows.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.180
I'm sorry to hear, Great-Auntie.

06:41.310 --> 06:43.517
Oh, fear not, lad.
It has been a blessing.

06:43.610 --> 06:46.647
I am now gifted with hearing
that would be the envy of many a gossip,

06:47.240 --> 06:49.811
and the ability
to scent truth from lies,

06:49.910 --> 06:51.696
if you catch my meaning.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.327
Oh, goodness. Who have we there?

06:55.790 --> 06:57.246
Another acquaintance to be made.

06:57.540 --> 06:59.861
Young Ian's mongrel, Rollo.

06:59.960 --> 07:01.450
Take hold of yer beast, lad.

07:01.790 --> 07:03.917
Come back, Rollo!

07:04.840 --> 07:07.047
Do come in, my dears,

07:07.470 --> 07:11.383
and we will show you
some River Run hospitality.

07:11.470 --> 07:13.347
Ulysses, will you lead the way
to the parlour?

07:13.430 --> 07:14.670
Yes, mistress.

07:22.770 --> 07:25.898
The thieves stole
our com and gemstones.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.028
Left us with little more
but the clothes on our backs.

07:29.110 --> 07:31.852
Wicked! Just wicked.

07:31.950 --> 07:34.077
To repay your kindness in such fashion.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.281
Bonnet and his men should be hangit.

07:36.370 --> 07:39.612
He woulda been, were it not for me.

07:40.580 --> 07:43.708
You sought the goodness in him,
and there was none to be found.

07:43.790 --> 07:45.496
Pray, think on it no more.

07:45.710 --> 07:47.758
Ye're welcome to stay here
as long as ye need.

07:48.340 --> 07:49.830
I'll not be a burden to you.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.751
No, we don't intend to stay that long.

07:51.930 --> 07:54.216
Bless ye, dears, ye're kin.

07:55.300 --> 07:58.554
'Twill not be a burden
to have a man of such strength

07:58.680 --> 08:00.762
and mind for business at my disposal.

08:00.850 --> 08:04.684
Why, the good men and women of Cape Fear
will be clamouring to engage with ye,

08:04.770 --> 08:07.728
especially once they've had
the pleasure of making yer acquaintance

08:07.820 --> 08:10.482
at a wee gathering
I intend to hold in yer honour.

08:12.280 --> 08:13.907
Ye're familiar
with my business dealings.

08:14.780 --> 08:18.989
I may not have my sight, dear,
but I have been keeping an eye on ye.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.991
Between yer experience
in Paris with Jared

08:22.080 --> 08:24.207
and the trade ye mastered in Edinburgh,

08:24.540 --> 08:27.202
ye're capable of whatever endeavour
you take on.

08:27.300 --> 08:30.167
'Twill not be long
before your fortunes are reversed.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.420
You flatter me, Auntie.

08:33.090 --> 08:34.887
Ye're not fond of flattery.

08:34.970 --> 08:37.757
Well, 'tis my right to do so.

08:38.220 --> 08:40.927
_ Who else am I
to laVIsh my attentions upon?

08:44.400 --> 08:45.606
Christ!

08:45.690 --> 08:48.181
Oh, Ian, what happened to ye?

08:48.520 --> 08:50.738
Rollo, he chased a creature
I've never seen before.

08:51.150 --> 08:54.358
Something akin to a badger,
black, though streaked with white.

08:54.740 --> 08:58.073
It lifted its tail
and sprayed a foul liquid from its arse.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.610
The stench, it burns my eyes!

09:01.790 --> 09:03.155
You encountered a skunk, lad.

09:03.250 --> 09:06.708
- A skunk? Is that venomous?
- No, Just malodorous.

09:06.790 --> 09:09.839
As luck would have it,
my friend John Quincy Myers is visiting.

09:09.920 --> 09:12.002
He's a man of the wild
who can rid your mongrel of the stench.

09:13.340 --> 09:14.420
Thank you, Great-Aunt.

09:15.090 --> 09:17.502
Ulysses, will you ask Myers to meet Ian

09:17.600 --> 09:18.885
at the front of the house,
near the jetty?

09:18.970 --> 09:20.050
Yes, mistress.

09:20.140 --> 09:22.472
But first, Ulysses,
show my nephew and his bride

09:22.560 --> 09:24.972
to their bedchamber,
where the air will be fresh.

09:25.060 --> 09:26.186
As you wish, mistress.

09:26.270 --> 09:28.647
After your travels, you'll desire
a bit of rest, will ye not?

09:29.480 --> 09:31.971
Aye. Thank ye, Auntie.

09:41.740 --> 09:43.196
It's remarkable, Sassenach.

09:44.330 --> 09:45.319
What is?

09:45.410 --> 09:47.662
The similarities
between Aunt Jocasta and my mother.

09:50.540 --> 09:53.998
Same smile, same manner, their voices.

09:54.420 --> 09:58.459
Always wished ye'd kent my mother,
but having ye meet my aunt is just fine.

10:06.980 --> 10:09.221
This will be your chamber, sir.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.140
Mistress.

10:14.530 --> 10:16.350
I trust all is well?

10:17.780 --> 10:21.238
If a need arises, you may call upon me.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.576
Thank you, Ulysses.

10:27.500 --> 10:28.865
Sir. Mistress.

10:29.540 --> 10:31.838
Please, call me Claire.

10:36.420 --> 10:37.751
Mistress Claire.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.079
What are your names?

10:41.390 --> 10:43.756
I'm Phaedre. That's Mary.

10:44.470 --> 10:46.017
Mistress Claire.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.055
Is there anything else
you'll be needing?

10:49.230 --> 10:51.107
No, thank you.

11:06.120 --> 11:10.659
Sassenach, you haven't had
much to say since our arrival.

11:13.630 --> 11:14.870
Claire...

11:18.090 --> 11:19.216
As ye say,

11:20.800 --> 11:22.791
one day, it will all be different.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.896
Is that a wolf
masquerading as a dog?

11:38.070 --> 11:41.107
I sincerely hope
he isn't partial to human flesh.

11:41.320 --> 11:43.060
Only if ye're thickly bearded.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.526
Well, I shall take my chances.

11:46.410 --> 11:47.741
John Quincy Myers.

11:47.830 --> 11:48.865
Ian Murray.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.149
Pleased to meet you, Ian.

11:51.370 --> 11:53.827
A dalliance with a skunk
is no laughing matter, boy.

11:53.920 --> 11:54.909
Aye.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.662
But Mother Nature,
in all her bounty and wisdom,

11:57.760 --> 12:00.331
offers us a chance
to wash the odour away,

12:00.420 --> 12:01.421
bathing in vinegar.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.508
Huh.
Well, I'll do whatever it takes.

12:04.680 --> 12:07.843
I dinna wish him to go on
reeking like the devil's arse.

12:10.270 --> 12:11.885
I've been allowing my beard to grow.

12:12.190 --> 12:14.852
Seems the men of the mountains
hereabouts have hearty ones.

12:14.940 --> 12:17.568
Uh, you've a long wait on yer hands.

12:17.650 --> 12:19.982
But me, I take after my daddy.

12:20.190 --> 12:22.602
My momma does admire a hairy man.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.908
Believes them to _be a rare comfort
on a cold wmter's nIght,

12:25.990 --> 12:27.696
and she's not the only one.

12:27.790 --> 12:30.281
The Indian ladies
enjoy my hairs well enough.

12:31.210 --> 12:33.360
Indian lassies like their men hairy?

12:33.710 --> 12:35.837
Well, those I've come across
certainly do.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.239
Hmm.

12:37.340 --> 12:40.832
It is, perhaps, naught but the novelty
of my whiskers, come to think of it.

12:40.920 --> 12:41.909
Well, their own men

12:42.010 --> 12:43.375
scarcely have bristles
on their bollocks,

12:43.470 --> 12:45.085
let alone their backsides.

12:45.180 --> 12:49.059
But you take one look at my buttocks,
and you'd think my daddy was a buffalo.

12:54.020 --> 12:55.009
What are they like?

12:56.400 --> 12:57.389
The Indians?

12:58.940 --> 13:00.646
That all depends on the tribe.

13:01.240 --> 13:04.903
Some can be friendly,
some you'd do well to steer clear of.

13:04.990 --> 13:08.232
I've heard there are Indians
that Will cut yer heart from yer chest

13:08.330 --> 13:09.695
and devour it whole.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.746
Is that true?

13:11.910 --> 13:15.209
Well, I can't say I've come across any
who do that exactly,

13:15.290 --> 13:17.030
but there are some

13:17.130 --> 13:19.121
who scalp those
they consider to be outsiders.

13:20.630 --> 13:22.871
Well, there are clansmen in Scotland
who'll do the same.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.291
Ye'll no see a Campbell
and a MacDonald together.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.097
Not without it ending in bloodshed.

13:29.720 --> 13:33.269
Indians dinna sound
that much different from Highlanders.

13:34.350 --> 13:36.227
That's a fine way
of looking at the world, Ian.

13:37.980 --> 13:39.311
It's ready, sir.

13:40.650 --> 13:43.437
Let's bathe this beast of yours
before we lose the light entirely.

13:44.650 --> 13:47.448
Come on. Come on. In you get, son.

14:05.090 --> 14:07.297
What else do you grow
in addition to tobacco?

14:08.010 --> 14:11.059
Indigo, cotton, pine.

14:11.140 --> 14:14.598
Our forests yield
200 barrels of turpentine monthly.

14:14.680 --> 14:17.592
But the greatest source of revenue
is our sawmill.

14:18.020 --> 14:20.898
We're able to ship timber
along the river as far as Virginia.

14:20.980 --> 14:24.234
Uh, Uncle Hector and you have achieved
a great amount here, Auntie.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.486
We were true partners.

14:26.950 --> 14:29.908
Hector never made a decision
regarding our beloved River Run

14:29.990 --> 14:32.117
without consulting with me first.

14:32.540 --> 14:34.030
Sounds very familiar.

14:35.910 --> 14:41.086
And how many slaves work here
at the River Run?

14:42.630 --> 14:44.791
One hundred and fifty-two.

14:46.050 --> 14:47.210
I purchase them in lots,

14:47.300 --> 14:49.586
in order to keep
those with children together.

14:49.930 --> 14:52.717
Over the years,
I found my slaves to be more productive

14:52.810 --> 14:54.050
when treated with benevolence.

14:55.390 --> 14:57.051
I'm very pleased to hear that, Auntie.

14:57.390 --> 15:00.644
I ken so_me owners seem
to treat theIr slaves as livestock.

15:00.730 --> 15:01.936
Livestock?

15:02.570 --> 15:06.279
Goodness, no. They're a great deal
more expensive than that, I assure you.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.140
Lord knows where they'd be
ifI hadna taken them on

15:09.280 --> 15:11.521
and given them a home and a purpose.

15:11.990 --> 15:15.539
Why, some are so dear to me,
I consider them friends.

15:17.290 --> 15:20.999
Do you think they feel the same way?

15:23.590 --> 15:26.548
I'm not sure I catch the meaning
you wish to convey, dear.

15:26.630 --> 15:28.416
Perhaps they see things
a little differently.

15:29.840 --> 15:32.138
Since they don't exactly have
any choice.

15:32.970 --> 15:36.269
My slaves are quite happy here,
I assure you.

15:36.350 --> 15:39.057
Why, only a few have tried
to run away over the years.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.641
What a curious mind you have, dear.

15:43.730 --> 15:47.143
One of the many qualities of my wife
that I cherish.

15:49.570 --> 15:50.855
If you'll excuse me, I...

15:50.950 --> 15:53.191
I'd asked Phaedre
to meet me in the garden.

15:53.490 --> 15:55.776
I need to replenish my supply of herbs.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.321
Of course, dear.

16:08.960 --> 16:13.329
Mistress, Lieutenant Wolff
has been waiting in the parlour for you.

16:13.430 --> 16:16.251
- Please have him join us here.
- Mistress.

16:18.390 --> 16:21.598
Lieutenant Wolff is the steward
of the naval stores contract

16:21.690 --> 16:23.681
that River Run has with the Royal Naw.

16:27.230 --> 16:28.686
Good day, Mistress Cameron.

16:28.780 --> 16:33.149
Lieutenant Wolff, allow me to introduce
my nephew, Jamie Fraser.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.193
- Ah, pleasure to meet you, Mr Fraser.
- Lieutenant Wolff.

16:36.950 --> 16:38.941
- Please.
- Of course.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.828
May I offer you some refreshment?

16:42.920 --> 16:44.160
No, no, thank you.

16:44.250 --> 16:45.956
What brings you here, Lieutenant?

16:47.000 --> 16:51.505
It is said that wheat is fetching
a good price at five shillings a bushel.

16:52.050 --> 16:54.883
Cultivate it on your fallow lands
along the river.

16:55.470 --> 16:56.755
May fetch you a handsome profit.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.132
I know His Majesty's Navy
is always looking to buy it.

17:01.640 --> 17:04.097
The cultivation _of wheat
along the river'll

17:04.190 --> 17:06.351
likely bring you a bushel of regret.

17:07.820 --> 17:08.809
I beg your pardon?

17:09.070 --> 17:12.642
The land along the river
is too damp for the grain to flourish.

17:14.030 --> 17:17.818
Rice, however,
would thrive along the river.

17:19.410 --> 17:23.073
Rice, at 12 shillings
per hundred-weight,

17:23.160 --> 17:25.822
'twould bring a fine profit,
now that I think on it,

17:25.920 --> 17:28.912
and it would keep the slaves well-fed.

17:30.380 --> 17:34.123
You seem to have a profound knowledge
of agricultural practices, Mr Fraser.

17:34.220 --> 17:38.919
I was raised working the land,
so I ken a bit about dirt, Lieutenant.

17:40.470 --> 17:41.550
Undoubtedly.

17:44.390 --> 17:46.893
I shall return to discuss
further contracts with you

17:46.980 --> 17:49.642
when you are not engaged in hosting kin.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.641
- Good day, Mistress Cameron.
- Lieutenant Wolff.

17:59.070 --> 18:01.322
I would say that the lieutenant

18:01.410 --> 18:04.459
has not been spoken to
in that manner very often.

18:06.620 --> 18:08.997
I'm sorry I offended your guest, Auntie.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.410
You were right to speak your mind, lad.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.877
It's a privilege I wish I could enjoy,

18:15.510 --> 18:17.296
but there's a certain

18:17.380 --> 18:19.428
delicacy to be deployed
in certain matters,

18:19.510 --> 18:23.264
where a woman's unsolicited views
are not always welcome.

18:36.110 --> 18:38.522
You didn't have to go
to all this trouble for me.

18:38.610 --> 18:39.656
Nonsense.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.367
With more time,
I'd have sent for some fine cloths

18:42.450 --> 18:43.610
from England or France.

18:44.450 --> 18:45.997
As luck would have it,
I've several gowns

18:46.080 --> 18:47.650
that can be altered to fit you.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.451
What colour is your hair, dear?
I hadna thought to ask.

18:51.170 --> 18:52.455
You sound a bit

18:53.550 --> 18:54.699
fair, somehow.

18:56.050 --> 18:58.621
That would serve the garment well.

18:59.050 --> 19:02.463
Pray, do not tell me
that you're black-haired and sallow.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.761
More or less dark brown.

19:06.310 --> 19:07.516
How does she look, Phaedre?

19:09.390 --> 19:11.438
Just fine, Miss Jo.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.060
Just fine.

19:13.570 --> 19:16.482
She's got white skin,
it's white as milk.

19:16.650 --> 19:19.608
With skin so pale,
will she not look washed out?

19:19.700 --> 19:22.271
Oh, no, mistress. She ain't washed out.

19:22.950 --> 19:26.989
She got bonny eyes of indigo,
and a bosom lassies would dream of.

19:28.330 --> 19:30.821
And she's tall, with a thin waist.

19:31.330 --> 19:34.037
A great deal taller
than Mistress Cameron.

19:34.170 --> 19:37.128
'Twas the picture
in my mind's eye already, dear Phaedre.

19:37.260 --> 19:40.832
Though there are men
who prefer a more modestly-sized woman,

19:40.930 --> 19:43.637
not wishing to be dwarfed
by the object of their affection.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.005
Indeed, mistress.

19:45.510 --> 19:47.637
Lieutenant Wolff being one of them.

19:47.810 --> 19:49.266
Oh, Phaedre.

19:49.730 --> 19:53.222
Any amorous intentions
Wolff has towards me,

19:53.310 --> 19:56.393
it's founded only in hearsay and gossip,
and we wilna indulge it.

19:56.940 --> 19:58.817
Now, Claire,

19:59.280 --> 20:02.101
tell me, how do you find River Run?

20:03.120 --> 20:05.236
After months without a home,
you must be greatly relieved

20:05.330 --> 20:08.447
to have such, well, fine accommodations.

20:10.830 --> 20:13.207
It's all very overwhelming.

20:13.500 --> 20:16.207
It is a splendid estate indeed.

20:16.300 --> 20:19.167
Many others have marvelled
at its grandeur.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.922
But what is it that you most admire?

20:23.220 --> 20:24.460
Oh, I've never

20:25.510 --> 20:29.173
stayed anywhere quite like it.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.932
The cadence of your voice

20:34.020 --> 20:36.102
tells me what you're not saying
plainly enough, dear.

20:36.190 --> 20:38.021
You harbour some disapproval?

20:42.110 --> 20:43.907
Well, I suppose I do.

20:45.450 --> 20:47.111
I don't agree with...

20:49.160 --> 20:50.821
With keeping people as property.

20:55.000 --> 20:55.989
Are you a Quaker?

20:57.920 --> 20:58.989
Quaker?

21:00.170 --> 21:01.660
No, I'm Catholic.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.922
How is it that you come
to share their views?

21:05.890 --> 21:09.382
I, uh, healed some Quakers once,

21:09.810 --> 21:14.053
and they expressed their opinions
to me regarding slavery.

21:15.900 --> 21:19.643
I have to admit,
I found some truth to their beliefs.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.440
Hmm.

21:26.530 --> 21:28.441
Jenny was right about you.

21:28.780 --> 21:30.281
You are a peculiar lass.

21:31.240 --> 21:36.280
She made mention in her letters
that you were spirited, headstrong,

21:36.830 --> 21:38.240
that you not blush
to share your thoughts

21:38.340 --> 21:40.991
on any matter, versed in it or not.

21:41.460 --> 21:42.961
The same could be said for Jenny.

21:44.510 --> 21:45.670
Oh, aye.

21:46.390 --> 21:47.630
Aye.

21:49.220 --> 21:50.847
You're a lively one, are ye not?

21:51.850 --> 21:53.977
It's no wonder my nephew is drawn to ye.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.806
You've the fire of MacKenzie in you.

22:01.940 --> 22:05.853
The party attracted
the cream of Cross Creek society,

22:05.950 --> 22:07.906
all to meet Jamie and me.

22:07.990 --> 22:11.574
I found myself discussing local politics
with Lieutenant l/l/o/ﬁj

22:11.740 --> 22:15.449
as well as Jocasta ’5 friend and advisor,
Farquard Campbell

22:15.660 --> 22:18.493
I heard they were causing trouble
at the courthouse in Beaufort.

22:18.710 --> 22:20.837
Oh, the taxes again.

22:21.420 --> 22:24.412
If it's trouble they want, it's trouble
they'll get from His Majesty's Army.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.159
I'd go so far as to send the Marines

22:26.260 --> 22:28.080
if it would help quell
the whimpering rogues.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.045
Tumultuous times ahead.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.301
Between the Indians
and now these Regulators,

22:32.930 --> 22:36.058
it'll be a miracle if we have a chance
to make something decent of this land.

22:36.140 --> 22:38.301
Well,
you can hardly blame either group

22:38.400 --> 22:39.856
for wanting their voices to be heard.

22:40.690 --> 22:41.816
Aye.

22:41.900 --> 22:44.562
The Indians were on these lands first,
were they not?

22:47.860 --> 22:49.441
How charmingly naive.

22:51.030 --> 22:53.908
Were it not for the Romans,
the good natives of Great Britain

22:53.990 --> 22:57.039
would be sheltering in dwellings
little better than mud huts today.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.991
No roads, no sophistication of any sort.

23:00.460 --> 23:03.372
The savages should be thankful
we're here to spare them a similar fate.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.216
If you'll excuse me.

23:18.350 --> 23:19.339
Mistress.

23:25.030 --> 23:28.352
Dear friends,
please, gather round.

23:30.990 --> 23:32.946
The guests are now assembled, mistress.

23:33.830 --> 23:37.789
It has been my honour
to introduce my nephew, Jamie Fraser,

23:37.870 --> 23:42.318
his lovely wife, Mistress Claire Fraser,
and my great-nephew, Ian Murray.

23:44.130 --> 23:45.119
But there is another reason

23:45.210 --> 23:47.166
I've brought you together
on this fine day.

23:47.260 --> 23:50.377
Mistress Cameron,
you've brought out the good vintage.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.756
What excellent news it must be.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.001
Indeed I have, Mr Campbell.

23:55.470 --> 23:57.461
All gathered here have kent
for quite some time

23:57.560 --> 23:59.676
that I have been agonising
over the matter

23:59.770 --> 24:02.056
of to whom I shall leave
my beloved River Run.

24:02.980 --> 24:05.562
Well, ye need wonder no more.

24:06.650 --> 24:10.939
I am pleased to announce
that I've decided to name

24:11.240 --> 24:13.231
my nephew, Jamie, as my heir.

24:14.660 --> 24:18.244
It is my intention that Jamie should act
as master of the estate immediately.

24:20.500 --> 24:23.128
I leave River Run in his hands.

24:47.230 --> 24:48.857
There's no doubt she's a MacKenzie.

24:49.690 --> 24:53.979
Publicly naming me heir
without telling me first was calculated.

24:55.700 --> 24:57.327
Something Colum or Dougal would've done.

24:57.780 --> 25:00.442
I can't own slaves, Jamie.

25:01.450 --> 25:02.860
On that, we are agreed upon.

25:06.500 --> 25:09.663
Though if I were master of River Run,

25:10.920 --> 25:12.467
might we not help the slaves,

25:12.970 --> 25:16.963
see that they're well-fed and clothed,
but work to set them free?

25:20.100 --> 25:23.843
Maybe we can make a small difference
for those in our part of the world.

25:25.310 --> 25:28.814
A spark that might light a fuse.

25:35.240 --> 25:37.868
I can't change River Run
without you, Sassenach.

25:42.370 --> 25:43.610
What do you say?

25:51.840 --> 25:54.627
Fuses often lead to explosions.

25:54.720 --> 25:55.869
Aye.

25:57.550 --> 25:59.211
Aye, but when the dust settles,

26:00.600 --> 26:02.670
oftentimes, the devil
ye're fighting is gone.

26:17.820 --> 26:20.232
I wish ye'd given me
a word in advance, Auntie.

26:22.410 --> 26:23.536
Aye.

26:24.540 --> 26:27.247
I ought to have discussed
the matter with you first,

26:27.830 --> 26:29.320
but who else am I_to share
my bounty With?

26:30.130 --> 26:31.995
My children have passed,
and I care for you

26:32.090 --> 26:33.409
as though you were my own.

26:34.510 --> 26:35.545
I'm grateful.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.330
You're deserving of it, lad.

26:39.720 --> 26:41.210
'Twill no doubt please you to ken

26:41.300 --> 26:43.803
that yer aunt's will and testament
is being drawn up,

26:43.890 --> 26:45.881
bequeathing unto you yer inheritance,
Mr Fraser.

26:48.900 --> 26:50.015
A braw sum.

26:50.110 --> 26:51.975
Well, ye'll have need of ready money

26:52.070 --> 26:54.356
to conduct business
as master of the estate.

26:57.240 --> 27:01.779
But there is one thing I would ask
before I'm formally named heir.

27:01.990 --> 27:05.323
Mr Fraser, no man ought
to look a gift horse in the mouth.

27:05.450 --> 27:09.079
Farquard, 'tis expected
that the lad should have questions.

27:09.250 --> 27:10.990
Any born leader should.

27:14.050 --> 27:15.039
What is it, nephew?

27:18.840 --> 27:20.888
I want to free the estate's slaves.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.136
Have you lost your head?

27:25.220 --> 27:27.097
My wife and I dinna wish to own slaves.

27:28.350 --> 27:31.342
And how do you propose
to produce anything without slaves?

27:31.480 --> 27:33.721
It is my intention
that every man and woman

27:33.820 --> 27:36.186
on the plantation shall earn
a fair wage.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.180
Allow slaves to earn a wage?

27:38.280 --> 27:41.602
I see no harm
in discussing the possibility.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.276
Perhaps you'd allow us
to benefit from your wisdom

27:44.370 --> 27:45.655
on the matter, Mr Campbell?

27:49.580 --> 27:52.572
Well, if you must hear
the insurmountable obstacles

27:52.670 --> 27:55.127
associated with the task
you Wish to undertake,

27:55.210 --> 27:56.620
Mr Fraser, I will oblige ye.

27:57.130 --> 27:59.758
First, you'll need to understand,

28:00.470 --> 28:03.678
liberty is granted only by permission
of the county court.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.091
- Reasonable enough.
- And ye must prove

28:05.180 --> 28:08.308
that each one of your slaves
has performed a meritorious service,

28:08.390 --> 28:10.301
such as the act of saving a life,

28:10.770 --> 28:13.398
for they will not be granted
a warrant of freedom without it.

28:13.480 --> 28:15.061
And if we allow

28:15.150 --> 28:17.641
that your slaves have performed
a meritorious service,

28:17.730 --> 28:19.391
you'd yet need to post a bond,

28:19.490 --> 28:21.981
ensuring the slaves' good conduct,

28:22.070 --> 28:26.234
and you'd need to offer sureties,
financial sureties.

28:26.330 --> 28:27.945
Well, I believe
that can be accommodated.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.827
A surety to the province
for each and every slave freed,

28:30.910 --> 28:33.117
an enormously expensive endeavour.

28:33.210 --> 28:34.620
You cannot put a price on freedom.

28:34.710 --> 28:37.543
But the Assembly can and does.

28:38.250 --> 28:41.799
One hundred pounds sterling a slave.

28:43.130 --> 28:46.463
That's over 15,000 pounds.

28:48.890 --> 28:51.677
Then I shall find a way
to increase River Run's revenues.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.556
What about the other plantation owners?

28:55.860 --> 28:57.475
You're threatening a way of life,

28:57.570 --> 29:00.482
a very important way of life
for this colony.

29:00.820 --> 29:05.063
Were ye among Quakers,
you'd find men of like mind, perhaps,

29:06.200 --> 29:08.361
but you're newly come to North Carolina,

29:08.450 --> 29:11.192
and ye dinna comprehend
the difficulties you will not only face,

29:11.290 --> 29:15.249
but also bring about
by entertaining such outlandish notions.

29:15.460 --> 29:17.951
You'll put lives at risk,

29:19.000 --> 29:20.501
not least your own.

29:24.220 --> 29:25.289
There have been others

29:25.390 --> 29:27.460
that have shared your views
on the matter.

29:28.890 --> 29:30.266
They've disappeared,

29:31.470 --> 29:33.802
never heard from again.

29:37.940 --> 29:42.149
The threat of harm wilna sway my mind,
Mr Campbell.

29:53.750 --> 29:56.207
Prove that every slave here
has saved a life?

29:57.580 --> 29:59.161
But how is that possible?

29:59.920 --> 30:02.548
- Nothing will change under these laws.
- No.

30:02.920 --> 30:04.660
Fear that may be
the truth of the matter.

30:06.010 --> 30:07.966
There is another way
to become a landowner.

30:09.390 --> 30:11.255
We could reconsider
Governor Tryon's offer.

30:11.350 --> 30:12.920
- Jamie...
- I ken you advised me against it,

30:13.020 --> 30:15.511
but with the land granted from Tryon,

30:15.600 --> 30:17.056
we wouldn't have to own slaves.

30:18.940 --> 30:22.103
We _could recruit settlers
and live on our own terms.

30:22.820 --> 30:25.027
And live in peace for a while.

30:25.900 --> 30:29.688
Accepting Tryon's offer
will lead us to fighting in another war.

30:32.200 --> 30:35.363
Mr Fraser, Mistress Cameron
requires your assistance.

30:35.710 --> 30:37.166
What is it, Auntie?

30:37.250 --> 30:39.457
There's been an unfortunate event.
A matter of bloodshed.

30:39.540 --> 30:43.169
I need you to act as my representative
in this grave matter of justice.

30:43.250 --> 30:44.251
Aye. What happened?

30:44.880 --> 30:47.428
Overseer Byrnes was attacked
by one of my Negroes.

30:47.550 --> 30:49.177
He cut the man's ear clean off.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.466
Well, then, he'll need a physician.

30:52.060 --> 30:54.176
If we hurry, I think I can reattach it.

30:54.270 --> 30:57.228
- Do you have a pistol, Mr Fraser?
- No.

30:57.310 --> 30:59.096
Well, then,
you must take Hector's. Phaedre.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.101
Incidents of this nature
can stir unrest.

31:01.190 --> 31:03.226
There may be more trouble
once you arrive.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.240
Whoa.

31:23.710 --> 31:26.543
- Glad you've arrived.
- We came as quickly as we could.

31:26.630 --> 31:28.712
MacNeill, this is Mr Fraser,

31:28.800 --> 31:31.212
Mistress Cameron's nephew
and appointed representative,

31:31.300 --> 31:32.631
and his wife, Mistress Fraser.

31:32.720 --> 31:34.210
I'm the Healer. Where's the injured man?

31:34.310 --> 31:35.629
I'll take you to him.

31:35.720 --> 31:38.769
- Which Negro drew Byrnes' blood?
- That was Rufus.

31:38.850 --> 31:41.307
Barked Byrnes like a pine tree
with his axe,

31:41.400 --> 31:43.186
right after Byrnes struck him
with the lash.

31:43.270 --> 31:46.182
- Is Rufus near and accounted for?
- You could say so.

31:46.780 --> 31:47.895
Mr Fraser will be aiding me

31:47.990 --> 31:49.890
in the oversight of Rufus' execution.

31:50.570 --> 31:52.811
Execution? Whatever for?

31:52.910 --> 31:54.446
The law of bloodshed demands it.

31:54.530 --> 31:57.283
Any slave guilty of the assault
of a white man, woman or child,

31:57.540 --> 31:59.861
thereby causing blood to be shed,
shall be put to death

31:59.960 --> 32:01.996
with a judge and representative present.

32:12.010 --> 32:13.216
We have to help him.

32:17.270 --> 32:19.670
- Let that man down at once!
- I will not!

32:20.140 --> 32:22.552
- Keep raising him up!
- That's enough!

32:23.310 --> 32:24.550
Stay back, damn you.

32:24.650 --> 32:25.719
Bring him down,

32:27.190 --> 32:28.316
or there'll be less
of your friend's face

32:28.400 --> 32:29.640
for my wife to tend to.

32:34.950 --> 32:37.692
You have no right
to intervene in my affairs.

32:37.790 --> 32:40.281
Rufus? Rufus, can you hear me?

32:40.460 --> 32:42.860
I'm her nephew, James Fraser,
acting on her behalf.

32:42.960 --> 32:44.075
Remain still.

32:44.170 --> 32:47.662
I don't give a ha'penny who you are.
This is not your business!

32:47.750 --> 32:50.412
No, Byrnes. You've done wrong.

32:50.760 --> 32:51.966
This was a matter for the law.

32:52.130 --> 32:55.964
I will not be struck by a Negro.
Not now, not ever.

32:56.050 --> 32:57.301
You'll have to answer...

32:57.390 --> 32:58.630
What do you need, Sassenach?

32:58.720 --> 33:00.096
IfI can get him to the house,

33:00.180 --> 33:01.727
I can remove the hook
and operate safely,

33:02.440 --> 33:03.896
and then I think I can save him.

33:03.980 --> 33:05.550
I was mutilated by this wretch!

33:05.650 --> 33:08.778
Your lawlessness will not be tolerated,
no matter the provocation.

33:08.860 --> 33:09.975
Will they let us take him?

33:10.070 --> 33:11.981
I won't give them any choice
in the matter.

33:15.370 --> 33:17.486
Let's get him
into the dining room onto the table.

33:17.580 --> 33:18.695
Aye.

33:19.160 --> 33:21.116
Move those chairs and clear the table.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.956
Now! Clear those things off!

33:24.040 --> 33:26.281
- Move.
- All right, ease him on.

33:26.670 --> 33:28.706
Ease him on. Easy, easy.

33:28.920 --> 33:32.799
Mary, find my nephew. Get him to bring
my medical box immediately.

33:33.130 --> 33:34.461
Yes, Mistress Claire.

33:34.800 --> 33:38.509
Phaedre, get me some clean linen,
some hot water, whiskey and two bowls.

33:40.180 --> 33:42.091
- Now, please!
- Dinna fash, lad.

33:42.180 --> 33:45.183
Bring it in here. Stay with me, Rufus.

33:45.730 --> 33:48.472
Where is Ian? Phaedre,

33:48.560 --> 33:50.858
the whiskey, one of the cloths,
and the bowl in that corner there.

33:50.940 --> 33:53.022
- Yes, Mistress Claire.
- Ian, get out my knives and needles,

33:53.110 --> 33:54.646
then clean them in the whiskey.

33:56.950 --> 33:58.315
And have the scissors ready.

34:00.160 --> 34:01.821
You take hold of this. Keep it steady.

34:04.540 --> 34:06.496
Mary, pour the water into the bowl.

34:06.580 --> 34:09.538
Phaedre, tear the cloth into strips
and put the bandages by Rufus.

34:09.630 --> 34:10.870
Yes, Mistress Claire.

34:12.340 --> 34:16.049
Ian, find the laudanum.
I need to sedate him.

34:17.510 --> 34:18.716
Here, Auntie.

34:18.970 --> 34:24.135
Rufus, this will help ease the pain.
All right, try and drink some.

34:26.890 --> 34:28.266
That's it. Right.

34:28.350 --> 34:29.851
A little bit more, a little bit more.

34:34.530 --> 34:35.519
Scissors.

34:39.410 --> 34:40.980
- Hold it steady.
- Aye.

34:48.750 --> 34:52.413
Ian, scalpel.
And have those swabs ready.

34:56.970 --> 34:57.959
All right.

35:02.010 --> 35:04.137
- I'll take it from here.
- Aye. Hold him down, lad.

35:10.810 --> 35:12.971
Swabs. Swabs! Swabs!

35:14.570 --> 35:15.559
More.

35:22.450 --> 35:24.782
Phaedre, take Mary away.

35:26.540 --> 35:27.529
More.

35:29.210 --> 35:31.326
Why would they bring the Negro
who attacked Byrnes here?

35:33.420 --> 35:34.455
Ulysses?

35:35.630 --> 35:39.043
It seems Mistress Fraser
is trying to heal Rufus.

35:40.130 --> 35:43.042
Heal him?
Why on earth would she do such a thing?

35:43.350 --> 35:44.749
Did you not intend to aid Byrnes?

35:45.350 --> 35:47.887
Byrnes and his men
wrongfully impaled the lad,

35:47.980 --> 35:50.722
and his wounds don't compare
to what was done to Rufus.

35:52.230 --> 35:55.779
It is regrettable
that he was treated with such violence.

35:55.860 --> 35:58.351
Byrnes and his men will have a price
to pay for their savage deeds,

35:58.490 --> 36:01.152
but, Jamie, he must be hangit.

36:01.570 --> 36:05.233
The top two instruments.
In my box. Disinfect them first.

36:05.700 --> 36:09.033
Mistress, Lieutenant Wolff
and Mr Campbell have arrived

36:09.120 --> 36:10.917
and wish to speak
with you and Mr Fraser.

36:15.250 --> 36:18.708
_ _ Jamie and I
Will receive them in the parlour.

36:22.090 --> 36:23.387
Yes, mistress.

36:24.430 --> 36:25.966
Hold them like this,
and keep it open.

36:26.060 --> 36:27.300
All right, Auntie.

36:35.230 --> 36:38.893
Your nephew may be a landowner's son,
Mistress Cameron,

36:39.190 --> 36:41.442
but it is evident
he knows nothing of property,

36:42.030 --> 36:44.942
nor how a master of an estate
such as this should conduct himself.

36:45.320 --> 36:49.495
An error of judgment, sir,
which has been brought to my attention.

36:49.580 --> 36:53.414
I understand your duty to your nephew,
but you also have a duty

36:53.500 --> 36:56.583
to uphold the laws of the land,
maintain order

36:56.670 --> 36:58.740
and see justice served at River Run.

36:58.840 --> 37:00.455
MacNeill is, at this very moment,

37:00.550 --> 37:02.040
spreading word
of your nephew's exploits.

37:02.170 --> 37:05.219
It's _no concern of theirs_.
Rufus is under my protection.

37:06.680 --> 37:10.389
Mr Fraser,
have you no modicum of respect

37:10.470 --> 37:12.631
for your aunt, her property
or that of her neighbours?

37:13.690 --> 37:16.727
Your error of judgment is grave, sir.

37:17.610 --> 37:19.350
If order is not maintained,
there is no telling

37:19.440 --> 37:20.850
what riotous behaviour could ensue.

37:21.030 --> 37:22.986
And What of those that mutilated Rufus?

37:23.490 --> 37:24.730
Will they not be punished?

37:24.820 --> 37:27.368
They have been jailed
for taking the law into their hands.

37:27.450 --> 37:29.190
And you and your Wife may join them

37:29.290 --> 37:31.690
for commission
of the same crime, Mr Fraser,

37:32.120 --> 37:36.705
for if your intransigence persists,
I Will insist Mr Campbell

37:36.920 --> 37:38.785
draw up a warrant for your arrest.

37:38.880 --> 37:43.419
My nephew isna yet familiar
with our laws, Lieutenant.

37:44.220 --> 37:45.881
We canna punish Jamie for his ignorance.

37:45.970 --> 37:49.713
Please, afford me an opportunity
to put this matter right.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.220
And What would you propose?

38:11.120 --> 38:12.109
He's stirring, Auntie.

38:13.960 --> 38:14.949
Take it slowly.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.076
Take it slowly. Take it slowly.

38:17.460 --> 38:21.169
There. There, now.
You'll still be dizzy.

38:22.250 --> 38:24.298
Here, drink some water.

38:31.180 --> 38:34.729
That's it. It's all right.
It's all right.

38:44.440 --> 38:47.898
- Where am I?
- You're in the main house.

38:50.410 --> 38:53.402
- I shouldn't be here.
- It's all right, Rufus.

38:54.160 --> 38:56.242
My husband is heir to this estate,

38:56.620 --> 38:58.997
and he and I brought you
from the timber camp.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.667
I removed the hook,
and I've tended to your injuries.

39:06.510 --> 39:08.671
Why did you heal me, mistress?

39:11.430 --> 39:13.671
- Well, why wouldn't I?
- You was there.

39:15.350 --> 39:17.341
You know why I was put on that hook.

39:18.060 --> 39:20.597
That doesn't mean
what they did to you was right.

39:20.770 --> 39:22.647
Shed a white man's blood.

39:24.820 --> 39:27.778
- Broke the laW.
- And we'll sort that out later.

39:28.860 --> 39:30.236
From What I can tell,

39:31.070 --> 39:32.571
that Byrnes is a son of a bitch.

39:33.990 --> 39:36.197
I'm sure you had good reason
to do what you did.

39:40.370 --> 39:41.371
What?

39:41.670 --> 39:44.412
I never heard a lady
speak like you before.

39:46.130 --> 39:48.917
You'll not encounter many ladies
like my Auntie Claire.

39:50.340 --> 39:52.752
I've heard her speak words
fit to make a sailor blush.

39:57.640 --> 40:00.768
Tell me, is there anyone
you'd like to see?

40:01.650 --> 40:02.685
Do you have family here?

40:05.730 --> 40:09.518
My family in Ajumako.

40:11.280 --> 40:12.656
Africa.

40:14.370 --> 40:15.689
Far, far away.

40:18.120 --> 40:19.326
You were taken from them?

40:21.000 --> 40:22.536
My sister, too.

40:24.290 --> 40:25.621
Abena.

40:28.880 --> 40:31.872
Men forced us from the trees
where we played.

40:35.300 --> 40:37.006
Parted us on the beach.

40:39.810 --> 40:42.517
Forced us to ships

40:43.730 --> 40:48.349
larger than anything I had seen before.

40:54.120 --> 40:55.405
You need your rest.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.200
You too, Ian.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.755
Before you turn in,

41:15.050 --> 41:17.757
have someone come down
and help me bring Rufus to my bedroom.

41:18.680 --> 41:20.136
He'll be more comfortable there.

41:21.520 --> 41:22.805
I Will, Auntie.

41:23.850 --> 41:24.839
Good night.

41:26.230 --> 41:27.219
Good night.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.329
Ulysses.

41:52.170 --> 41:55.219
It's late.
Shouldn't you have turned in by now?

41:55.590 --> 42:00.505
Mistress Cameron asked me
to keep an eye on things.

42:02.180 --> 42:03.226
I see.

42:03.310 --> 42:06.017
How is your patient faring?

42:07.440 --> 42:09.396
He's survived the surgery.

42:10.520 --> 42:13.819
I intend to do whatever I can
to make sure he recovers.

42:22.080 --> 42:25.402
Allow me to take that, mistress.

42:27.210 --> 42:28.529
Something bothering you?

42:36.340 --> 42:38.171
Forgive me
for being forthright, mistress,

42:39.680 --> 42:41.170
but persist along your path,

42:41.680 --> 42:44.808
and Rufus will face a fate
far worse than death.

42:47.690 --> 42:50.011
- What do you mean?
- Saving that boy's soul

42:50.440 --> 42:51.930
is all that can be done for him now.

42:53.860 --> 42:58.229
Once the overseers come,
they will tear the limbs from his body

42:58.320 --> 43:01.619
and leave what little is left behind
as a warning for the rest of us if we...

43:03.370 --> 43:05.827
If we disobey the law.

43:09.750 --> 43:11.832
It would have been better for us all
had he...

43:13.880 --> 43:15.757
Had he died on this hook.

43:19.550 --> 43:21.256
Good night, mistress.

43:32.980 --> 43:34.857
Must they stand there all night?

43:35.070 --> 43:36.810
Dinna be angry With Farquard and Wolff.

43:36.900 --> 43:39.061
Your actions haven't inspired
a great deal of trust.

43:39.410 --> 43:42.698
It was charitable of them to grant us
an opportunity to rectify this

43:43.280 --> 43:44.577
lamentable occurrence.

43:44.660 --> 43:46.491
Is there no other way, Auntie?

43:46.950 --> 43:47.951
No.

43:48.330 --> 43:50.537
If we dinna deliver
what was agreed upon,

43:50.870 --> 43:53.122
Farquard and Wolff
will be the least of our concerns.

44:16.480 --> 44:18.232
You have until midnight, Claire.

44:28.500 --> 44:29.615
To do What?

44:30.080 --> 44:31.820
To turn Rufus over.

44:42.970 --> 44:43.959
To be executed.

44:44.800 --> 44:47.052
No. No, I can't do that.

44:47.140 --> 44:49.096
I Wish there was another way.

44:56.940 --> 44:58.225
Do you think you can heal him?

45:02.910 --> 45:04.775
I've gotten him over
the worst part of it.

45:07.950 --> 45:09.941
There's always a risk of infection.

45:11.790 --> 45:12.779
So,

45:14.710 --> 45:17.497
if you do save him, what then?

45:22.760 --> 45:25.968
Well, we...
We could say that he escaped.

45:26.050 --> 45:27.347
Condemn the others?

45:28.100 --> 45:30.421
The slaves working
alongside him that day.

45:31.980 --> 45:34.016
- I don't understand.
- It's the law.

45:34.980 --> 45:37.892
A way of ensuring
no crime goes unpunished.

45:38.690 --> 45:41.602
If the guilty man
doesna take his share of the blame,

45:41.690 --> 45:44.193
then his fellow slaves
must be punished instead.

45:47.240 --> 45:49.231
- Mistress Cameron!
- Get him out!

45:49.660 --> 45:51.287
Mr Fraser!

46:00.170 --> 46:01.580
It's the law!

46:04.970 --> 46:06.176
Christ.

46:07.010 --> 46:08.671
They'll tear him apart.

46:11.600 --> 46:12.885
Stay here.

46:16.270 --> 46:19.148
It's nearly midnight.
Ye ken what must be done.

46:19.570 --> 46:21.640
That isn't the law. That's a mob.

46:21.730 --> 46:23.982
Yes, and they will burn River Run
to the ground

46:24.070 --> 46:25.526
if justice isna served.

46:25.990 --> 46:27.776
Ye canna deliver the criminal
from his fate.

46:31.370 --> 46:32.485
Mr Fraser.

46:35.290 --> 46:37.417
Send him out, you bastard.
Send him out.

46:40.460 --> 46:41.996
Mistress Cameron!

46:42.670 --> 46:44.410
Mr Fraser!

46:44.510 --> 46:46.967
Turn over the lawless Negro!

46:47.970 --> 46:49.506
Turn your slave out!

46:59.560 --> 47:03.929
Blessed Bride, yer wife's foolishness
will get us all killed.

47:05.280 --> 47:06.895
I must address my neighbours.

47:07.150 --> 47:08.811
- Ulysses.
- Mistress.

47:10.450 --> 47:11.610
Auntie.

47:14.410 --> 47:16.708
I ken ye swore an oath
to do no harm, but...

47:19.630 --> 47:22.337
Perhaps ye could aid him
the way ye did Colum.

47:23.710 --> 47:24.790
What?

47:24.880 --> 47:26.791
If your oath is to do no harm, then

47:27.220 --> 47:28.676
isn't it better to save his soul

47:28.760 --> 47:31.388
than to have those men
tear it from his body?

47:37.140 --> 47:39.267
Mistress Cameron,
where is the Negro?

47:39.350 --> 47:40.556
He must be punished!

47:40.650 --> 47:41.969
- My nephew...
- Bring him out!

47:43.110 --> 47:46.102
My nephew, Jamie,
is preparing to deliver him to you.

47:48.240 --> 47:51.027
I assure you,
Rufus Will pay for his crimes.

47:51.410 --> 47:54.026
Lawlessness wilna be tolerated
at River Run.

47:56.790 --> 47:58.155
Mistress.

48:13.890 --> 48:15.505
I'm here, Rufus.

48:30.610 --> 48:32.521
Bring him out! Bring him out now!

48:32.610 --> 48:34.658
Blessed Bride,
will you not allow me to speak?

48:34.740 --> 48:36.571
Get him out here!

48:36.660 --> 48:38.070
We will not wait no longer!

48:44.920 --> 48:46.740
I'm going to make you a tea.

48:49.760 --> 48:51.216
It'll help you sleep.

48:55.890 --> 48:58.347
My nephew, Jamie, is a man of his word.

48:58.770 --> 49:02.183
He will deliver the Negro at midnight,
and not a moment sooner,

49:02.270 --> 49:06.354
as was agreed upon
by Lieutenant Wolff and Mr Campbell.

49:07.480 --> 49:12.520
I intend to serve justice,
as the law commands.

49:40.100 --> 49:41.215
Here.

49:49.980 --> 49:51.277
Easy.

50:11.510 --> 50:13.410
Tell me about your sister.

50:14.340 --> 50:15.420
Abena.

50:18.140 --> 50:20.096
What did you like to do as children?

50:24.140 --> 50:27.928
Fish the river at night
for butter catfish.

50:30.150 --> 50:31.606
Abena's favourite.

50:35.570 --> 50:36.946
That sounds lovely.

50:41.200 --> 50:44.112
I still fish the river at night,

50:46.500 --> 50:50.334
like Abena and I used to do long ago.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.547
You love her very much.

50:57.550 --> 50:59.131
I watch the moonlight

51:00.600 --> 51:01.806
on water,

51:03.520 --> 51:04.726
and I think

51:06.730 --> 51:08.846
Abena might be somewhere

51:09.980 --> 51:11.561
under the same moon,

51:13.940 --> 51:15.567
and I dream...

51:17.570 --> 51:19.902
I dream I might see my sister

51:21.620 --> 51:23.190
again one day.

51:29.620 --> 51:30.871
You will.

51:57.070 --> 51:58.606
Send the slave out!

51:58.700 --> 52:00.406
- Bring him out!
- Your time is up.

52:00.490 --> 52:03.823
'Tis midnight, Mistress Cameron.
We're through waiting!

52:24.890 --> 52:26.596
I'm bending my knee,

52:27.520 --> 52:29.727
in the eye of the Father who created me.

52:31.390 --> 52:35.679
Pour down from heaven
the rich blessing of thy forgiveness.

52:37.480 --> 52:39.061
Be thou patient With us.

52:43.280 --> 52:45.362
Grant to us, thou saviour of glory,

52:47.330 --> 52:49.036
the lo i/e of God.

52:52.080 --> 52:55.743
And the wﬂl to do on earth at all times

52:56.800 --> 53:00.839
as angels and saints do in heaven.

53:04.180 --> 53:05.249
String him up!

53:05.350 --> 53:06.749
Give us thy peace.

53:06.850 --> 53:08.670
String him up, lads!
