00:15.521 --> 00:17.588
So... thanks again, guys.

00:17.623 --> 00:19.190
This... this was a real lifesaver.

00:19.225 --> 00:21.658
Don't even mention it, dude. Anytime.

00:21.693 --> 00:24.294
No, I would've been homeless,

00:24.329 --> 00:27.330
- so you really saved me.
- Dude, listen,

00:27.365 --> 00:29.432
I'm sorry, but, like,
I'd have you stay longer,

00:29.467 --> 00:31.802
but, you know, my cousin's coming
to town. You know how that is.

00:31.837 --> 00:34.039
Don't mention it. Family...
family first. I get it.

00:34.064 --> 00:35.665
- Peace out, man.
- Bye.

00:36.341 --> 00:39.608
- Oh!
- Every time.

00:39.643 --> 00:41.453
- You're gonna miss that, aren't you?
- I am.

00:41.478 --> 00:43.011
I left my key on the tub.

00:43.031 --> 00:44.364
Thank you. See you, Pete.

00:56.377 --> 00:57.710
Did he buy it?

00:57.745 --> 00:59.411
I do not care.

01:01.516 --> 01:04.282
That guy sucks.

01:14.327 --> 01:15.960
Hello?

01:17.296 --> 01:19.531
- Artie?
<i>- Uh, Pete!</i>

01:19.566 --> 01:21.198
Hey, what's up, man?

01:21.234 --> 01:22.734
<i>Hey, what's
going on with you, man?</i>

01:22.769 --> 01:23.835
<i>I haven't seen you since Albany.</i>

01:23.870 --> 01:25.403
<i>You were holding coke for me up there.</i>

01:25.438 --> 01:27.738
I... I'm sorry, man.

01:27.773 --> 01:31.008
That woman was gonna
take you down a dark path.

01:31.043 --> 01:33.010
I... I had to intercept.

01:33.045 --> 01:36.254
- I... I thwarted you. I'm...
<i>- You thwarted me?</i>

01:36.682 --> 01:40.651
Yeah, I'm sorry. I... I
thought maybe you're mad?

01:40.686 --> 01:42.786
<i>Mad? Are you kidding
me? I'm proud of ya.</i>

01:42.821 --> 01:44.120
<i>I mean, I thought you... I dunno.</i>

01:44.156 --> 01:46.392
<i>Listen, she was all right
looking. Did you fuck her?</i>

01:46.634 --> 01:48.691
It was the craziest night of my life.

01:48.726 --> 01:51.493
I... I got pepper-sprayed
by that woman,

01:51.529 --> 01:54.697
then we went back to her
place, she gave me cocaine,

01:54.732 --> 01:57.132
and I pretended to do cocaine.

02:00.538 --> 02:03.504
Sorry. Is someone...
Is someone else there?

02:03.909 --> 02:06.541
I... Okay, hold on. Wait.
You were pepper-sprayed

02:06.577 --> 02:08.333
and then, um...

02:08.358 --> 02:10.511
like, how do you pretend to do cocaine?

02:11.476 --> 02:13.512
You hold the cocaine up to your face,

02:13.537 --> 02:15.007
but you blow out instead of sucking in.

02:15.032 --> 02:16.270
<i> Sorry, who is this?</i>

02:16.294 --> 02:17.686
Well, listen, man,
you're on my podcast,

02:17.721 --> 02:20.487
- and that's Sarah Silverman.
- Hi, Peaches.

02:20.522 --> 02:21.892
Artie, you...

02:21.917 --> 02:23.467
Hi, Sarah.

02:23.993 --> 02:25.225
Big fan.

02:25.260 --> 02:27.995
I wanna hear more about this
story. This is a good story.

02:28.030 --> 02:29.396
Yeah, yeah, get over here, man.

02:29.431 --> 02:31.465
<i>We'll... we'll fuck
around on the air.</i>

02:31.928 --> 02:35.668
You... You want me to come on
your podcast with Sarah Silverman?

02:35.704 --> 02:37.503
Yeah, yeah, come on down.

02:37.538 --> 02:39.438
Sarah, if I can just say
that <i> Wreck-It Ralph</i> is

02:39.474 --> 02:41.040
maybe one of my favorite movies...

02:41.076 --> 02:43.175
Definitely one of my
favorite movies of all time...

02:43.211 --> 02:44.711
All right, whatever. Okay, great.

02:44.746 --> 02:46.145
Hello?

02:47.682 --> 02:48.881
Okay.

02:48.917 --> 02:51.417
I was already a comedian
when I lost my virginity.

02:51.452 --> 02:53.418
I was 19, but, you know, it was...

02:53.453 --> 02:56.822
True story. I lost my
virginity to a Brazilian hooker

02:56.857 --> 02:59.290
in the back of my father's handicap van.

02:59.326 --> 03:02.027
No lie. It was in the
parking lot of a diner.

03:02.062 --> 03:03.996
- Sounds so right.
- I miss her.

03:04.031 --> 03:06.832
I actually miss her. Now, Pete,
have you lost your virginity yet?

03:06.867 --> 03:08.466
I have had sex with a woman, my wife.

03:08.502 --> 03:09.857
Oh, your wife.

03:09.883 --> 03:11.402
On our wedding night.
That's when I lost my virginity.

03:11.437 --> 03:12.770
Your wedding night. You waited.

03:12.805 --> 03:15.973
Yeah, well... yes. It's in the Bible
not to have sex before marriage.

03:16.009 --> 03:18.575
- It is?
- So, we would like dry-hump and...

03:18.611 --> 03:20.811
Oh my God, I miss dry-humping.

03:20.847 --> 03:22.046
Me too. I miss the third grade.

03:22.081 --> 03:25.916
Dry-humping's romantic. It's
like a friction-based cum.

03:25.952 --> 03:27.212
- That's right.
- Please.

03:27.237 --> 03:30.120
Well, if you love dry-humping,
you'll be happy to know

03:30.155 --> 03:33.123
that it's very big in
the Christian community...

03:33.158 --> 03:36.492
Well into your late 20s. Oh my
God, when I was six and seven,

03:36.528 --> 03:39.896
I was so slutty with the
furniture in my house.

03:39.931 --> 03:43.899
I... I felt guilty. I thought I was
cheating with the corner of my bed

03:43.934 --> 03:46.001
with the corner of the couch.

03:46.037 --> 03:50.139
I'm just saying, we were very
"wait till marriage" people,

03:50.174 --> 03:52.340
- and so...
- But that's just a loophole.

03:52.376 --> 03:53.542
If you're not supposed to have sex,

03:53.577 --> 03:56.879
and then you're just grinding
and creaming your jeans...

03:56.914 --> 03:59.782
- Really, yeah.
- ...you think you're tricking God?

03:59.817 --> 04:04.085
"You better be cumming in
your pants and not having sex."

04:04.120 --> 04:06.287
- That... that is how absurd it is.
- "That's important to me."

04:06.322 --> 04:09.724
- Think about it.
- Sex is a special thing when you wait

04:09.759 --> 04:11.592
and you've only done
it with that person. I don't...

04:11.627 --> 04:14.528
You didn't have oral sex before marriage
even?

04:14.564 --> 04:19.132
Well... one time, but that's when
I knew we were gonna get married.

04:19.168 --> 04:21.668
- Right.
- She gave me a blow job...

04:21.704 --> 04:23.469
- Oh, great.
- ...and instead of enjoying it,

04:23.505 --> 04:26.339
I swear, I was like, "Maybe August."

04:26.374 --> 04:28.274
- Like I was planning...
- "Maybe August" for what?

04:28.310 --> 04:29.710
- That's so romantic.
- To get married,

04:29.745 --> 04:30.779
because I knew I was only...

04:30.804 --> 04:32.478
Oh! You were thinking about centerpieces

04:32.514 --> 04:33.980
- while you were getting a blow job?
- Yes!

04:34.016 --> 04:35.514
It was like an engagement blow job.

04:35.549 --> 04:36.739
You know what's a great blow job?

04:36.764 --> 04:38.217
A divorce blow job is a great blow job.

04:38.252 --> 04:40.285
- Oh really?
- Yeah. 'Cause it's not from your wife.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.421
Well...

04:48.462 --> 04:50.162
Great live comedy tonight, guys.

04:50.198 --> 04:52.496
We've got a great live comedy
show. Great live comedy.

04:52.532 --> 04:56.968
Great live comedy. Great
live comedy tonight, 8:30.

05:02.308 --> 05:03.908
Great live com... Hey. Oh.

05:03.944 --> 05:05.710
Hey! I know this guy!

05:05.746 --> 05:08.079
Sorry, I didn't... Obviously,
I didn't recognize you.

05:08.115 --> 05:09.713
- My friend Pete.
- Yeah.

05:09.749 --> 05:12.515
- The podcast. Podcast Pete.
- From just hours ago.

05:12.551 --> 05:14.551
I'm honored. Nice to see ya.

05:14.586 --> 05:16.120
- What are you doing?
- I didn't recognize you.

05:16.155 --> 05:18.822
I'm... I'm handing out fliers
for the Boston. I'm barking.

05:18.858 --> 05:21.391
Oh, you're barking. That's
your... you got a job barking.

05:21.426 --> 05:23.693
- That's good.
- Well, yeah, I mean,

05:23.729 --> 05:26.362
I do it for stage time.
If I get five people,

05:26.397 --> 05:28.264
they let me go on at
the end of the night...

05:28.299 --> 05:29.773
if anyone's still there.

05:29.798 --> 05:31.333
You don't have a job.
How do you make money?

05:31.369 --> 05:33.569
Great live comedy, guys.

05:33.604 --> 05:36.105
I'm kind of in-between jobs right now.

05:36.141 --> 05:40.342
I'm flying below the radar,
staying on couches, you know.

05:40.378 --> 05:42.145
I eat a lot of free samples.

05:43.613 --> 05:45.747
I eat 75-cent hot dogs,

05:45.783 --> 05:48.817
- then I get a lot of free toppings.
- Oh, you're homeless.

05:48.852 --> 05:50.852
- What's that?
- You're homeless.

05:50.888 --> 05:53.388
- No. No.
- Do you have a home?

05:53.423 --> 05:56.457
- No. But, you know...
- So, you're homeless.

05:56.493 --> 05:59.543
Not all those who wander
are lost, you know?

05:59.568 --> 06:01.329
I... You know, I stay
on people's couches.

06:01.354 --> 06:02.487
Where are you staying tonight?

06:02.512 --> 06:04.665
I don't have anything
lined up for today,

06:04.700 --> 06:08.102
but, you know, after the
show, I send out little feelers

06:08.137 --> 06:11.138
and, "Hey, what
neighborhood do you live in?"

06:11.174 --> 06:14.541
Which train do you take?"
And then I befriend them.

06:14.576 --> 06:16.177
I can't. It's so sad. This is so sad.

06:16.212 --> 06:18.744
And then at the end of the night,
I have a pillow.

06:18.780 --> 06:20.250
All right.

06:20.275 --> 06:23.516
I feel like homeless people are...

06:23.551 --> 06:25.618
It's another category.

06:26.445 --> 06:28.289
When you're done tonight,

06:28.323 --> 06:30.824
go here. You can stay at my place.

06:30.859 --> 06:33.859
- What? Really?
- Yeah.

06:35.196 --> 06:37.084
I... Wow, thank you.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.199
You know, I'm kind of in
a weird place, emotionally.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.434
I don't know if we should be...

06:42.469 --> 06:44.837
- staying...
- I'm not gonna fuck you.

06:44.872 --> 06:47.706
I'm excited that you
have that much moxie.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.108
Maybe you can get your
shit together after all.

06:50.144 --> 06:51.909
- I misread the...
- Jesus Christ.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.285
Ask for Steve. He might fuck you.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.314
Thank you, Sarah!

06:56.349 --> 06:59.317
Uh, we got a... we got
a... We got a place to stay.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.451
Great live comedy. Ha!

07:00.486 --> 07:02.753
Come see me at 1:15 a.m. tonight.

07:03.532 --> 07:06.390
I think if birds knew how
many dumb names we call them,

07:06.425 --> 07:08.591
they'd take down a lot more planes.

07:08.626 --> 07:11.895
Right? Just get all the birds together

07:11.930 --> 07:13.830
take out a bunch of planes.

07:13.866 --> 07:15.198
What... What is going on?

07:15.234 --> 07:16.632
Nobody showed up.

07:17.541 --> 07:18.474
Nobody?

07:19.002 --> 07:20.337
There was a guy here earlier,

07:20.372 --> 07:23.139
but he saw what was
happening, and he left.

07:24.243 --> 07:28.043
So, what, do we just
cancel everything? No show?

07:28.509 --> 07:30.812
Well, he's got a really funny new bit

07:30.848 --> 07:32.848
that he's work... Working out right now.

07:32.884 --> 07:35.650
Yeah, I barked for four
hours. Can I have this?

07:38.155 --> 07:40.890
Has anybody
seen <i>Mr. Robot?</i>

07:43.059 --> 07:45.159
- Yes. Yes.
- Just say yes so that...

07:46.029 --> 07:47.695
I wish it was called <i>Mrs. Robot</i>

07:47.730 --> 07:50.331
and it was about the maid
from <i> The Jetsons.</i>

07:53.870 --> 07:55.536
That's gotta be fleshed out.

08:13.055 --> 08:14.354
<i>Hello?</i>

08:14.390 --> 08:18.024
- Hello?
<i>- Hi. Sorry. Is this Steve?</i>

08:18.059 --> 08:19.591
Who's asking?

08:19.627 --> 08:21.360
<i>This is... This is Pete?</i>

08:22.046 --> 08:24.015
Is... is that a question?

08:24.799 --> 08:27.099
- <i>What?</i>
- Are you asking me if your name is Pete?

08:27.135 --> 08:29.501
<i>No, this is Pete. Like,
I was being polite.</i>

08:29.537 --> 08:31.370
- <i>Hi, Pete.</i>
- Hi.

08:31.406 --> 08:34.739
I'm a friend of Sarah, um,
well, not really a friend.

08:42.182 --> 08:45.583
Hey, so, um, I stay
upstairs, in the guest room.

08:45.618 --> 08:47.577
You can take the couch,

08:47.602 --> 08:49.587
 because Dave's got sciatica
and sleeps on the floor.

08:49.622 --> 08:51.521
There's laundry downstairs.

08:51.557 --> 08:54.058
I'm assuming you're gonna
wanna do that right away.

08:54.093 --> 08:56.827
If there's anything in the
dryer of mine, you can fold it.

08:57.756 --> 08:59.997
- Hey. Who's this?
- Oh, Dave, this is...

09:00.032 --> 09:01.932
- Hey, I'm Pete, Sarah's friend.
- Pete.

09:01.968 --> 09:03.434
Did you bring a toothbrush?

09:03.469 --> 09:05.302
- What?
- Did you bring a toothbrush?

09:06.339 --> 09:08.371
I... Yes, I have a toothbrush.

09:08.406 --> 09:09.723
Well, good, because a lot of people

09:09.748 --> 09:11.341
come here, they don't bring a toothbrush,

09:11.376 --> 09:14.844
then I go in there, and I see
my toothbrush is a little amiss,

09:14.879 --> 09:17.213
but I can't be sure, so I touch it.

09:17.248 --> 09:19.548
It's damp to the touch,
but I'm still not sure.

09:19.584 --> 09:21.584
So, if you could leave
yours on the counter,

09:21.619 --> 09:23.619
it would really put me at ease.

09:23.654 --> 09:26.355
- Put it on the counter.
- I can do that.

09:26.390 --> 09:29.124
So, Sarah's letting you stay here too?

09:29.159 --> 09:30.358
Yeah, that's right.

09:31.128 --> 09:33.462
Weren't you on her TV
show? I mean, that...

09:34.062 --> 09:36.264
Yeah, that was, like, six years ago, man.

09:36.300 --> 09:38.433
What happened to you?

09:38.469 --> 09:41.935
Oh, she feels bad. I'm
going through a divorce,

09:41.971 --> 09:44.271
- so I'm kinda floating around.
- All right.

09:44.307 --> 09:45.672
Do you have a nut allergy?

09:46.308 --> 09:47.975
- No.
- Okay, 'cause we're about to make

09:48.011 --> 09:49.443
PB and J's for the week.

09:49.479 --> 09:51.879
We go through them really fast.

09:51.914 --> 09:53.280
Are you a white or a wheat guy?

09:53.316 --> 09:55.449
- Steve.
- We're out of white bread.

09:57.987 --> 10:00.220
- Fuck.
- Wheat's fine.

10:00.255 --> 10:02.955
- He's a wheat guy.
- Ah! Wheat it is!

10:12.667 --> 10:15.467
<i>...they come in. In a note
that we got several years ago,</i>

10:15.503 --> 10:17.836
<i>from a little boy
only known by "Jason,"</i>

10:17.871 --> 10:20.305
<i>and he wrote with a crayon,
"Thank you for the PJ’s.</i>

10:20.341 --> 10:21.907
<i>They're the first
I've ever owned."</i>

10:21.942 --> 10:23.542
<i>All sizes of pajamas are needed,</i>

10:23.577 --> 10:27.346
<i>but especially larger
sizes... 10, 12, and 14,</i>

10:27.381 --> 10:30.249
<i>also adult sizes for teenagers.</i>

10:30.284 --> 10:33.984
<i>For more information,
head to pajamaprogram.org.</i>

10:43.629 --> 10:45.796
- Hey.
- Hey!

10:45.831 --> 10:48.399
- I made it.
- You made it.

10:48.442 --> 10:50.604
Oh my God, thank you so much for this.

10:50.629 --> 10:52.635
This is incredible.
Your house is amazing.

10:52.671 --> 10:54.471
Isn't it fancy? Hey, guys.

10:54.506 --> 10:57.274
- 'Sup?
- Did you meet Steve and Davey boy?

10:57.309 --> 10:59.509
Yup. They gave me the lay of the land.

11:00.371 --> 11:02.478
Okay. What's your plan?

11:03.315 --> 11:05.648
I don't really have a plan. Do
you wanna watch a movie or...

11:05.684 --> 11:09.452
No. You're welcome to
stay here. I just...

11:09.487 --> 11:11.454
If you're not working towards a plan,

11:11.489 --> 11:13.551
I can't... I can't...
I... You can't stay here,

11:13.576 --> 11:14.367
Right.

11:14.392 --> 11:16.525
because I just...
I've already ruined Steve.

11:16.561 --> 11:19.267
He's ruined, and I can't
have three of these.

11:20.328 --> 11:22.663
Oh no, I... I have a
plan. I... I'm on a track.

11:22.688 --> 11:23.532
Good.

11:23.557 --> 11:26.934
I'm getting up every
night, doing a lot of stand-up.

11:26.970 --> 11:28.954
I'm going at it hard.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.938
Great. But you make

11:30.974 --> 11:34.976
- zero dollars at stand-up.
- Yeah. That's not how I make my money.

11:35.011 --> 11:37.145
Oh. Okay, how do you make your money?

11:37.180 --> 11:39.314
I was married, as you know,

11:39.349 --> 11:43.183
so up until very recently,
my wife was supporting me.

11:43.219 --> 11:45.919
And, you know, I got
married when I was 22,

11:45.954 --> 11:48.522
so for the first 22,
my mom supported me.

11:50.993 --> 11:53.960
So, it was mom, and then wife,

11:53.996 --> 11:55.564
and now...

11:56.272 --> 12:00.032
How are you gonna afford, like...

12:00.398 --> 12:04.870
a place to live or a laptop or insurance

12:04.905 --> 12:07.440
or, like, be able to go to the dentist?

12:07.475 --> 12:11.511
You have to go to the dentist.
You have to floss every single day.

12:11.546 --> 12:14.079
- Really?
- Death creeps in through the gums.

12:14.115 --> 12:17.682
I always thought that was
a lie started by Big Floss.

12:19.286 --> 12:23.361
That's funny. You're an idiot.

12:23.386 --> 12:25.390
Yeah. No, that's...
Those are the jokes I like.

12:25.425 --> 12:28.627
I like clean, silly. I just
want everyone to have a fun time.

12:28.662 --> 12:30.462
You'd be a great warm-up!

12:30.497 --> 12:33.063
- What do you mean?
- You should be a warm-up comedian.

12:33.098 --> 12:35.366
What... Is that like a... what?

12:35.401 --> 12:38.502
Like, you know how they shoot all
different shows in New York City?

12:38.538 --> 12:40.337
Some of them have live audiences.

12:40.373 --> 12:42.039
Oh, the guy that tells everyone to clap?

12:42.074 --> 12:44.708
Exactly. He's the
comedian that comes out,

12:44.743 --> 12:47.344
tells some jokes, have dance
contests with the audience,

12:47.380 --> 12:50.313
just anything to kind of
entertain them in between shots.

12:50.348 --> 12:52.649
- I could do that. I... Yeah, all right.
- Yes.

12:52.684 --> 12:53.794
They get paid?

12:53.820 --> 12:55.244
They get paid.

12:55.269 --> 12:58.488
It's so steady, and then you
can still do stand-up at night.

12:58.523 --> 13:01.357
- Where do I sign?
- I know.

13:01.393 --> 13:02.758
I mean, I would do that in a heartbeat.

13:02.794 --> 13:05.364
I know a couple of TV shows that
shoot in this city.

13:05.395 --> 13:07.637
Hey, excuse me.
I've lived here for three months,

13:07.665 --> 13:10.098
and you haven't once tried
to get me a warm-up gig.

13:10.513 --> 13:13.368
That's right, Steve. And
that's because the one time

13:13.404 --> 13:15.637
I set you up with a
meeting with a producer,

13:15.673 --> 13:18.507
you tried to fuck her,
and it was super smarmy.

13:18.542 --> 13:21.410
I didn't try to fuck her.
She tried to fuck me...

13:21.445 --> 13:23.077
- and succeeded.
- Ooh.

13:23.112 --> 13:24.679
She did have some big ol' titties.

13:24.714 --> 13:26.947
Oh yeah.

13:26.982 --> 13:30.518
This is a prison of my own design.

13:39.595 --> 13:41.561
I don't want to waste your
time, so I'll be direct.

13:41.597 --> 13:43.830
We already have a warm-up guy,
but Sarah says you're funny,

13:43.865 --> 13:47.133
- so it can't hurt to have you on-call.
- Like an understudy.

13:47.168 --> 13:48.468
Call it that if you want.

13:48.503 --> 13:50.903
I'm excited for whatever. I'm
a really big fan of the show.

13:50.939 --> 13:52.180
Okay, just a heads up.

13:52.205 --> 13:53.640
Our warm-up guy is not gonna
be happy you're here.

13:53.675 --> 13:55.308
He's a little intense,
so whatever you do,

13:55.344 --> 13:56.875
- don't tell him why you're here.
- What should I say?

13:56.910 --> 13:59.053
Schmitty, could you
please let me know

13:59.078 --> 14:01.247
if there are disabled
people in the audience?

14:01.282 --> 14:02.748
I can't keep going out there blind!

14:02.783 --> 14:06.585
If there's anything irregular about
the audience, you need to tell me.

14:06.621 --> 14:08.220
- I can't not know these things.
- Okay.

14:08.256 --> 14:10.088
Would it kill you if
there... You could tell me

14:10.124 --> 14:13.158
there are two rows of people
that don't speak fucking English!

14:13.193 --> 14:14.892
Or people in wheelchairs!

14:14.927 --> 14:17.528
I'm telling people to get up
and dance, and they can't get up!

14:17.564 --> 14:18.896
- Copy that.
- Yeah, you say that,

14:18.931 --> 14:21.899
but you don't fucking copy anything.
I want to see you write it down.

14:21.934 --> 14:26.371
Copy this down. Tell me when
there are people in the crowd

14:26.406 --> 14:29.707
that have a disability
or are from fucking Spain!

14:31.176 --> 14:33.910
- What's this?
- This is Pete. He'll be doing warm-up

14:33.945 --> 14:36.045
if you ever have to
miss a day. Fill him in.

14:37.349 --> 14:40.384
"Miss a day"? Does
Rachael know about this?

14:40.419 --> 14:42.852
Schmitty, is this coming from Rachael?

14:43.264 --> 14:46.356
Is this coming from Ray? Fuck!

14:46.392 --> 14:50.526
How about a hand for the birthday girl?

14:50.561 --> 14:53.128
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Gwen.

14:53.164 --> 14:56.031
Gwen. And you're 29 years old today?

14:56.066 --> 14:59.101
You look fantastic. And what are
you gonna do on this special day?

14:59.136 --> 15:00.903
Coming to see Rachael Ray!

15:03.274 --> 15:06.174
Yeah, that's great. Oh!

15:06.209 --> 15:08.777
Okay, you're a beautiful crowd.

15:08.812 --> 15:10.512
Now, you see we've got a big studio here,

15:10.547 --> 15:13.981
so I need you to fill it with your
love and laughter and applause.

15:14.017 --> 15:16.651
Ready? Three, two, one!

15:18.789 --> 15:21.488
Who wants Kit Kats, huh? Yeah!

15:21.524 --> 15:24.057
Who likes Kit Kats? There you go!

15:24.092 --> 15:27.194
All right, keep calm! Ladies
and gentlemen, here she is!

15:27.229 --> 15:29.396
Rachael Ray!

15:33.202 --> 15:35.336
Hi, everybody!

15:35.371 --> 15:38.071
Oh, sit down. Sit down, please.

15:38.106 --> 15:40.272
Whoo! Fucking animals.

15:40.308 --> 15:42.975
"It's my birthday.
I came to see Rachael Ray."

15:43.010 --> 15:44.811
They give me nothing to work with.

15:44.846 --> 15:46.165
You're taking notes?

15:46.190 --> 15:48.113
Yeah, I'm just writing down some of
the things you say.

15:48.138 --> 15:51.682
Oh, Jesus, dude. Don't... You're
staring at me, you're taking notes.

15:51.838 --> 15:53.619
They offered you the job, right?

15:53.655 --> 15:55.454
I swear, nobody said anything

15:55.489 --> 15:57.440
about me taking your job. I'm
just gonna fill in...

15:57.465 --> 15:58.166
Oh God.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.892
...if you're ever, you
know, sick or can't make it.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.461
I'm training my own replacement.

16:02.496 --> 16:05.263
They're handing me a
shovel to dig my own grave.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.699
I can't believe this.

16:07.735 --> 16:10.201
I promise, nobody promised me your job.

16:10.237 --> 16:13.571
I'm just here to observe. Maybe
I'll do warm-up for another show.

16:13.606 --> 16:16.240
Oh yeah, for another show,
and so you take my shit

16:16.275 --> 16:18.242
that I've been working
on for fucking years,

16:18.277 --> 16:20.310
and you steal it and go to another show.

16:20.346 --> 16:23.013
Nobody owns, "Who's from far away?"

16:23.048 --> 16:25.983
Nobody owns, "Any birthdays here?"

16:26.018 --> 16:28.085
These are free... Free for everyone.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.286
How did you get in here,
really? How did you get in here?

16:30.321 --> 16:32.555
- I was referred by a friend.
- Who?

16:32.591 --> 16:34.239
- A comedian.
- Who?

16:34.659 --> 16:37.560
- Sarah Silverman referred me.
- Sarah Silverman?

16:37.596 --> 16:39.496
- I just met her.
- Holy God.

16:39.531 --> 16:42.331
These people are medieval.
They're squeezing me out of a job.

16:42.367 --> 16:45.702
No! Sarah Silverman. Oh, did
Seinfeld drive you over here

16:45.737 --> 16:48.303
in one of his little fancy
cars, drinking coffee?

16:49.075 --> 16:50.305
I get the reference, but no.

16:50.340 --> 16:53.842
I mean, if you're gonna fire me,
at least let me ass-fuck an intern.

16:53.878 --> 16:56.545
That's unbelievable. This is bullshit.

16:56.580 --> 16:59.782
Hey! Isn't she wonderful?

16:59.817 --> 17:03.818
Rachael Ray! Tony, hit
me with that beat, baby.

17:03.853 --> 17:06.788
Yeah. Come on, put your hands together.

17:06.823 --> 17:10.124
Oh, I'm gonna moonwalk. Whoa!

17:10.159 --> 17:12.660
All right, we are back, guys.

17:12.694 --> 17:15.896
Big finish to the show
today. My husband John

17:15.932 --> 17:17.097
- is joining me in the kitchen.
- Hello.

17:17.133 --> 17:20.000
If you guys watch, then you
know what time that means it is.

17:20.036 --> 17:21.468
- Time for you to start drinking.
- That's right.

17:21.502 --> 17:24.065
We're gonna make a cocktail with
Johnny, our mixologist.

17:24.089 --> 17:26.339
Sorry, sorry. Sorry, Rachael. We're
just having audio issues.

17:26.374 --> 17:28.909
If you can just go see
Freddy, it'll be five minutes.

17:28.944 --> 17:30.944
I'm sorry, you guys.
We're gonna take a fiver.

17:30.979 --> 17:32.814
Honey, why don't you come with me?

17:32.846 --> 17:34.393
- Sounds like a good idea.
- We'll be right back.

17:34.674 --> 17:36.742
Five, maybe seven minutes.

17:36.753 --> 17:38.961
- They're gonna have to rewire Rachael.
- Fuck!

17:38.986 --> 17:41.020
Okay, could you just calm down
and go do your job?

17:41.057 --> 17:42.457
Excuse me? Calm down?

17:42.492 --> 17:43.959
Schmitty, you've been riding my ass

17:43.983 --> 17:45.592
for two months, ever since Rory left.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.762
Then bring in this motherfucker?

17:47.797 --> 17:50.064
- Can you just...
- Watching me, taking notes.

17:50.099 --> 17:51.966
Take the fucking Mic and do your job.

17:59.107 --> 18:01.742
Hey, everybody.

18:01.777 --> 18:05.646
- Hey.
- Hey. We're having some, uh,

18:05.681 --> 18:08.047
a little difficulty,
little technical problems.

18:08.083 --> 18:10.016
It'll be up in a minute, but...

18:11.186 --> 18:13.753
I got some coupons from Omaha steaks.

18:13.788 --> 18:17.657
Huh?

18:17.692 --> 18:21.827
Yeah. Yeah. Y'all wanna win some meat.

18:21.862 --> 18:24.463
Don't you? Yeah.

18:24.499 --> 18:27.166
Of course. Of course you do.

18:27.676 --> 18:29.734
That's all you care about. Prizes.

18:30.552 --> 18:33.237
"Let's get something.
Let's grab something.

18:33.273 --> 18:35.407
Throw me a fucking Kit Kat bar."

18:36.264 --> 18:38.142
You're just like every other American.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.632
All they want is something to eat and

18:40.656 --> 18:42.613
something to fuck, and they're happy.

18:43.296 --> 18:46.082
Do you have any idea what's
going on in the world?

18:46.118 --> 18:47.990
Any idea?

18:48.015 --> 18:50.354
"No! Just let me have my steak!"

18:50.816 --> 18:52.556
You just sit there and flap your flippers

18:52.591 --> 18:55.826
every time you see the fish
bucket, you fucking morons.

18:55.861 --> 18:58.195
Can we get security?
Security now, please.

18:58.230 --> 19:00.664
Look at you, sitting on your asses,

19:00.700 --> 19:02.432
standing in line at the Apple store.

19:02.467 --> 19:04.399
You know they're gonna
have the same product

19:04.424 --> 19:06.202
next week, but no,
you gotta have it now!

19:06.237 --> 19:08.270
You gotta have it now! And by the way,

19:08.306 --> 19:10.206
leave your children alone, okay?

19:10.241 --> 19:13.209
Let 'em fucking fail.
They're not gonna peak at 12.

19:13.244 --> 19:16.979
And stop taking pictures
with your fucking iPhones!

19:17.014 --> 19:18.781
That's bullshit. Don't touch me, guys!

19:18.817 --> 19:20.716
- Don't touch me!
- Come on, get him outta here!

19:20.751 --> 19:22.751
And you know when I said
you were a great audience?

19:22.786 --> 19:25.520
- I lied. You're a shitty audience.
- Come with us, please.

19:26.009 --> 19:29.658
And, Gwen, nobody gives a
fuck about your birthday.

19:29.693 --> 19:30.755
Let's go. Right now.

19:30.780 --> 19:32.794
Yeah. Ooh, what are you doing here?

19:32.830 --> 19:34.696
Learning about secrets of cinnamon?

19:34.732 --> 19:36.897
Go home! Read a goddamn book!

19:36.932 --> 19:38.666
Spend some time with your children!

19:38.701 --> 19:41.235
- Keep walking.
- Here you go, Schmitt.

19:41.741 --> 19:44.104
Fuck you, dick.

19:44.139 --> 19:45.740
What the fuck did you say to him?

19:45.775 --> 19:48.265
I didn't say anything to him.
What are you talking about?

19:48.289 --> 19:49.744
Fucking fix it. Go!

19:49.746 --> 19:52.346
- "Fix it"?
- Go out there. Get them back.

19:53.715 --> 19:54.814
Okay.

19:56.385 --> 19:58.585
Um... Hi.

19:58.620 --> 19:59.841
Hello.

20:00.438 --> 20:01.305
Um...

20:02.223 --> 20:05.124
Hi, everyone. My name
is, uh, my name is Pete.

20:05.693 --> 20:08.327
I'm the...
I'm the other warm-up.

20:09.364 --> 20:12.130
We have two here at <i> The Rachael Ray Show.</i>

20:13.768 --> 20:16.134
I feel like... I feel
like we can get over this.

20:16.169 --> 20:18.504
Together, we can get over this. Uh...

20:19.673 --> 20:21.874
The... The scary uncle has left.

20:21.909 --> 20:24.710
Right?

20:26.113 --> 20:27.945
God, what was that?

20:28.505 --> 20:31.715
I feel like Dad just yelled
at us on the way to Disneyland.

20:31.751 --> 20:35.085
We need to shake it
off. That was terrifying.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.687
Did you see the vein in his neck?

20:37.724 --> 20:39.256
It was pulsing.

20:39.292 --> 20:41.859
If we could hook up some
jumper cables to that vein,

20:41.895 --> 20:44.861
we could power Vancouver.

20:44.897 --> 20:46.696
Maybe we could, uh...
Let's dance or something.

20:46.732 --> 20:50.166
You guys wanna dance? Tony?
Tony, can I get a beat?

20:50.201 --> 20:52.068
Okay, let me get some people.

20:52.103 --> 20:53.503
Will you dance with me? Come on up!

20:53.539 --> 20:55.305
Give her a round of
applause, everybody, come on!

20:55.340 --> 20:59.443
The bad man is gone. We're gonna
dance. Will you dance with us?

20:59.478 --> 21:03.111
Yes, sir, please get
in there. Get in here.

21:03.147 --> 21:06.415
Gwen, it's your birthday.
Give it up for Gwen!

21:06.451 --> 21:08.016
Give it up for Gwen!

21:08.052 --> 21:11.821
Okay, what do you think of this one?

21:11.856 --> 21:14.122
Pretty good. Number two?

21:14.158 --> 21:16.325
Pretty good.

21:16.360 --> 21:20.061
What about number three? Oh sh... Okay.

21:20.096 --> 21:24.699
What about Gwen? Oh! Oh!

21:24.734 --> 21:29.437
Dance Gwen! Clap for
Gwen! It's her birthday!

21:29.473 --> 21:31.405
Now, that was amazing! Sit down!

21:31.441 --> 21:34.408
Everybody stand up! Everybody stand up!

21:34.444 --> 21:36.610
- Say, "Hey!"
- Hey!

21:36.645 --> 21:38.311
- Say, "Ho!"
- Ho!

21:38.347 --> 21:40.681
- Say, "He was scary!"
- He was scary!

21:40.716 --> 21:42.983
- I'm glad he's gone!
- Glad he's gone!

21:43.018 --> 21:44.918
- Rachael Ray!
- Rachael Ray!

21:44.954 --> 21:46.687
- Rachael Ray!
- Rachael Ray!

21:46.722 --> 21:49.055
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

21:49.091 --> 21:50.657
Okay, sit down. Sit down!

21:50.693 --> 21:52.825
- Let's get some Kit Kats!
- Yeah!

21:52.861 --> 21:54.159
Where are the Kit Kats?

21:54.195 --> 21:56.228
I'm in charge of the Kit Kats now!

21:58.766 --> 22:02.635
This shot actually
makes me motion sick.

22:04.739 --> 22:06.973
- Hey!
- Hey.

22:07.008 --> 22:08.273
How'd it go?

22:09.443 --> 22:12.076
It was crazy. I got there,

22:12.112 --> 22:14.279
they have a warm-up, and then...

22:14.648 --> 22:17.482
he loses his mind. He
turned on everybody.

22:17.518 --> 22:21.319
He flips out. The-the...
Schmitty gave me the Mic

22:21.354 --> 22:23.889
- and was like, "Get out there."
- You did warm-up today?

22:23.924 --> 22:25.857
I went out and did warm-up.

22:25.893 --> 22:27.822
They paid me for today,

22:27.847 --> 22:30.027
they said I can come back for, like,
a trial week.

22:30.062 --> 22:34.297
- You got it.
- But like, I mean, yeah, I got it.

22:37.202 --> 22:39.073
- Huh.
- Is this...

22:39.872 --> 22:42.072
You guys watching <i> Planet
Earth</i> or is this <i> Nova?</i>

22:42.618 --> 22:44.073
I feel like...

22:46.244 --> 22:48.611
You know what? You only get a few times

22:48.647 --> 22:50.613
to have that, like, "I got it" moment,

22:50.649 --> 22:53.315
and I feel like you kinda shit
the bed with this one.

22:53.832 --> 22:55.785
Like, go out, come back in,

22:55.820 --> 22:59.055
act like you didn't get it, and then...

22:59.472 --> 23:01.189
the reveal, "I got it."

23:01.224 --> 23:03.959
- Make it bigger. Really...
- Misdirect.

23:03.994 --> 23:05.594
It's a missed opportunity.

23:06.429 --> 23:08.196
- Ah. Okay.
- Yeah.

23:08.231 --> 23:10.766
- Sell it.
- Let's give the kid another shot.

23:18.274 --> 23:20.074
I don't think Pete did well today.

23:20.109 --> 23:22.209
I mean, he's never done it before.

23:22.244 --> 23:23.978
I feel bad for him.

23:30.784 --> 23:32.319
Hey, buddy. You okay?

23:33.556 --> 23:34.921
I don't...

23:34.957 --> 23:37.223
I... I'm sorry.

23:37.258 --> 23:39.525
You set that all up for me, and...

23:39.561 --> 23:42.796
I know, Steve, you would've
liked that opportunity and...

23:46.034 --> 23:47.567
And I got it.

23:47.603 --> 23:50.536
Oh my God! Oh my God!

23:50.572 --> 23:52.170
- Ah!
- Woo!

23:52.206 --> 23:53.706
Whoopee!

23:55.109 --> 23:57.442
- You got it!
- Jerk me off. Jerk me off.

23:59.246 --> 24:00.145
Woo!

24:00.180 --> 24:01.914
I feel like fucking shit

24:01.949 --> 24:04.349
because I went in there and I got it!

24:08.855 --> 24:11.388
- My parents were right.
- What?

24:12.425 --> 24:15.693
I got it!

24:15.729 --> 24:17.929
I've been getting shit a long time,

24:17.964 --> 24:19.697
and I've pretty much had it,

24:19.733 --> 24:23.167
so today was the last
day I was gonna take it.

24:24.237 --> 24:26.069
That's why I'm so glad I got it!

24:46.991 --> 24:48.724
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:52.363 --> 24:55.564
- Is this okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

24:56.107 --> 24:57.066
I'm just so happy.

24:57.101 --> 24:59.476
I... I don't remember the last time

24:59.501 --> 25:02.236
I felt so good and silly
and fun and right.

25:02.272 --> 25:04.806
And I did something that I'm good at,

25:04.841 --> 25:07.575
that, like, felt like me.

25:07.610 --> 25:10.145
I really owe you big time.

25:10.180 --> 25:13.537
- Oh, my joy. You know what I think?
- What's that?

25:13.562 --> 25:16.765
I think somebody
earned a little tooty-toot-a-loot

25:17.101 --> 25:20.620
- on the weed pipe.
- I've never... I don't...

25:20.656 --> 25:22.422
You've never smoked pot?

25:23.659 --> 25:26.593
- No, I've never smoked... yeah.
- Aww.

25:26.628 --> 25:28.495
Well, I don't want to
push. I mean, I wouldn't...

25:28.530 --> 25:32.032
Don't do it then, unless you
want me to encourage you to.

25:32.527 --> 25:34.032
Okay, yeah, talk me into it.

25:34.069 --> 25:36.302
Just have a little. What's the big deal?

25:36.337 --> 25:39.238
Just have a puff. Celebrate.

25:39.273 --> 25:42.141
- You had a great day.
- What do I do?

25:43.578 --> 25:45.678
Press the button...

25:45.714 --> 25:48.748
...suck it in, and then take it out,

25:48.783 --> 25:51.516
and suck in again, like a second time.

25:52.519 --> 25:54.753
That's enough.

25:54.788 --> 25:59.257
Oh my God, you just smoked
pot. You just smoked pot.

25:59.300 --> 26:02.548
- I think... Okay, thank you.
- Yes. Put it down for a second.

26:02.713 --> 26:05.728
I feel kind of weird that I...
I have something to tell you.

26:06.900 --> 26:09.633
I've never seen your... I've
never seen your stand-up.

26:09.668 --> 26:12.336
That's okay.

26:12.371 --> 26:15.439
I feel weird. I... I
thought maybe you'd be mad.

26:15.474 --> 26:17.742
- I just...
- No, I don't care.

26:17.777 --> 26:20.778
Now I can use my jokes, like,
in conversation with you,

26:20.813 --> 26:22.880
and you'll think I'm a genius.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.115
I love stand-up. It's just...

26:25.150 --> 26:28.251
I... I don't know if you know...
Remember, I'm raised religious,

26:28.286 --> 26:31.087
and our community... you know,

26:31.112 --> 26:32.822
you make fun of Jesus.

26:32.858 --> 26:36.860
- Who?
- You know, Jesus of Nazareth?

26:36.895 --> 26:40.463
- So, you're a God person.
- Yes, I'm a God person.

26:40.498 --> 26:42.597
Aw.

26:42.633 --> 26:44.599
- When does it work?
- In seconds.

26:44.635 --> 26:46.235
If you smoke too much, you can't go back,

26:46.260 --> 26:47.070
Okay.

26:47.095 --> 26:48.303
so just make it a treat,
just have a little puff.

26:48.338 --> 26:50.405
I feel like I'm floating in honey.

26:50.440 --> 26:53.575
Is that... is that
what the buzz is about?

26:53.610 --> 26:56.478
- That's the buzz.
- That's what all you guys are like,

26:56.513 --> 26:59.280
"Hey, put down the hacky sack.

26:59.573 --> 27:01.540
I have something to tell you guys."

27:01.984 --> 27:05.452
After a while, you stop
needing to talk about the high.

27:09.025 --> 27:12.960
Just, like, exist.

27:12.996 --> 27:16.505
Is that a weird laugh?

27:17.763 --> 27:18.965
These are nice, man. I shouldn't...

27:19.001 --> 27:21.686
I shouldn't be sleeping on your
couch. I should sleep out here.

27:22.507 --> 27:24.838
Wait a minute. You
can't sleep here tonight.

27:24.873 --> 27:26.239
- What?
- You've got a job,

27:26.275 --> 27:28.675
you're making hundreds of dollars a day,

27:28.710 --> 27:30.210
you've been sleeping on couches.

27:30.245 --> 27:31.278
You really want to sleep tonight

27:31.313 --> 27:34.479
with your head on a pillow
filled with Steve's farts?

27:34.515 --> 27:37.316
- No.
- Treat yourself.

27:37.938 --> 27:39.518
You're gonna thank me for this.
