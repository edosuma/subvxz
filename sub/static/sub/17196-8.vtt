previously on <i>gracepoint...</i>

00:19.453 --> 00:20.686
Lars pierson.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.054
His cell phone number
was found

00:22.056 --> 00:24.123
In the lining
of danny's jacket.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.959
I see you again,
I will lock you up.

00:26.961 --> 00:29.061
I'm pregnant.
We have to keep it.

00:29.063 --> 00:32.064
If the solanos need help,
they've got me to turn to.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.132
Shut your mouth.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.333
Get the hell
out of gracepoint.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.468
I know men
who'd rape you.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.003
Do you think
tom ran away?

00:38.005 --> 00:40.139
We have no idea
where he is.

00:40.141 --> 00:42.141
We've shifted our focus
to locating tom.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.342
Tommy!

00:43.344 --> 00:44.843
Tell me
about the boy.

00:44.845 --> 00:47.112
Answer...The question.

00:48.314 --> 00:50.215
Good lord.

01:12.006 --> 01:15.407
Hey, it's okay, it's okay,
it's okay...

01:15.409 --> 01:18.177
.3 miles from the road
to the bike.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.379
.9 miles from the bike
to the cabin.

01:20.381 --> 01:21.914
<i>If he was here,</i>
<i>we would have found him.</i>

01:21.916 --> 01:23.348
<i>We have to go wider.</i>

01:23.350 --> 01:25.184
We have gone wider.

01:25.186 --> 01:27.186
We don't know
where he was taken.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.887
<i>He could be hurt</i>
<i>somewhere.</i>

01:28.889 --> 01:30.355

<i>Hello?</i>

01:32.259 --> 01:33.525
[sighs]

01:33.527 --> 01:36.195
Damn it.
I'm not
hearing you.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.197
Can you hear me now?
Better.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.466
Morgan says to wait
till dawn,

01:40.468 --> 01:41.733
But we've got
to do it now.

01:41.735 --> 01:43.035
<i>We cannot wait.</i>

01:43.037 --> 01:44.636
I think you should
go home, ellie.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.805
What?
<i>I think</i>
<i>morgan's right.</i>

01:46.807 --> 01:48.474
We'll expand
in the morning,

01:48.476 --> 01:50.309
Use the light,
bring more people in.

01:50.311 --> 01:53.212
You just
called me ellie.

01:56.049 --> 01:58.484
How can I leave
when he's still missing?

01:58.486 --> 01:59.885
People are looking.
You need rest.

01:59.887 --> 02:02.821
No, I'm coming
to you now,

02:02.823 --> 02:04.289
And we will get pierson
to talk.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.290
<i>I'm on pierson,</i>
<i>I promise.</i>

02:05.292 --> 02:06.825
I was just with him.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.560
I'll keep going back in
till he [static].

02:08.562 --> 02:10.629
Sir?
I cannot hear you.

02:10.631 --> 02:13.232
You are breaking up.
<i>[continues, garbled]</i>

02:13.234 --> 02:15.134
What?
I can't--hello?

02:16.436 --> 02:19.338
Damn it.

02:19.340 --> 02:22.341
Damn it!

02:22.343 --> 02:25.077
Hey.

02:25.079 --> 02:26.311
Hey.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.679
I just got off
with owen.

02:27.681 --> 02:30.282
Dylan is having
a rough time.

02:30.284 --> 02:32.284
He's--
he's not asleep?

02:32.286 --> 02:36.121
No, he never went down.
He wants his mama.

02:36.123 --> 02:38.257
Carver did just
tell me to leave.

02:38.259 --> 02:41.593
He is your boss.

02:41.595 --> 02:44.363
Yeah.
Go to dylan.

02:44.365 --> 02:47.199
He needs you.
I'll stay here.

02:47.201 --> 02:48.867
Okay.
Okay?

02:48.869 --> 02:50.202
Okay.

02:56.643 --> 02:58.944
<i>(girl)</i>
<i>a lot of us</i>
<i>are kind of scared.</i>

02:58.946 --> 03:01.480
<i>I mean, we know</i>
<i>we're probably safe,</i>

03:01.482 --> 03:03.115
<i>And we think</i>
<i>they're gonna find him.</i>

03:03.117 --> 03:04.616
Do you think
they're gonna find him?

03:08.121 --> 03:09.621
I'd ask what
you're doing here,

03:09.623 --> 03:11.623
But there's no need for that,
is there?

03:11.625 --> 03:14.793
I'm actually
looking for owen.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.628
Tried texting him,
calling.

03:16.630 --> 03:19.398
He isn't answering.
Go figure.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.300
I know he's close
with his aunt.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.968
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry,

03:22.970 --> 03:24.236
See if there's anything
I can do.

03:24.238 --> 03:25.971
You haven't done
enough already?

03:25.973 --> 03:27.839
That's not fair.
Really?

03:27.841 --> 03:30.542
Hounding an innocent man
until he takes his own life?

03:30.544 --> 03:33.178
Stirring up trouble when
the town's already suffering?

03:33.180 --> 03:35.914
The minute tom disappeared,
I knew you'd be back here.

03:35.916 --> 03:36.982
What an opportunity.

03:36.984 --> 03:39.251
One kid dead,
another missing.

03:39.253 --> 03:40.852
More reason
to slam the police,

03:40.854 --> 03:42.321
Claim some connection
to rosemont.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.656
It would've been wrong
of me not to.

03:44.658 --> 03:45.824
Detective carver
worked both cases,

03:45.826 --> 03:47.693
Each with multiple victims.

03:47.695 --> 03:51.230
You know as well as I do this
could be another serial killer.

03:51.232 --> 03:53.599
I want you
out of my office.

03:57.503 --> 03:59.071
Is owen
at the millers'?

04:03.776 --> 04:05.777
I hope they find tom.

Hey, you ever go
camping with tommy?

04:35.109 --> 04:39.711
Uh, yeah, we took
one trip to sequoia.

04:39.713 --> 04:42.214
It was right before
dylan was born.

04:42.216 --> 04:43.915
You ever take danny?

04:43.917 --> 04:45.751
Oh, all the time.

04:45.753 --> 04:50.322
But last year, he went on that
overnight with Sunday school,

04:50.324 --> 04:52.090
And he got a massive
spider bite.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.825
Tom told us.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.061
Yeah, poor kid.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.230
He swelled like
somebody clocked him.

04:58.232 --> 05:00.065
He swore he'd never
do it again.

05:00.067 --> 05:03.302
[dogs barking distantly]

05:03.304 --> 05:06.071

I'll take any bed
you've got,

05:06.073 --> 05:08.073
Preferably not next
to detective carver but--

05:08.075 --> 05:10.075
We're fully booked.

05:10.077 --> 05:12.144
There's been a lot
going on.

05:12.146 --> 05:14.246
I'm sure you've heard.

05:14.248 --> 05:15.681
I have heard.

05:15.683 --> 05:19.584
You might try the motor lodge
down on route 3.

05:19.586 --> 05:22.087
Maybe you'll have
better luck there.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.522

Why was tom miller found
near your property?

07:18.739 --> 07:20.138
[tiredly]
oh, who'd you find?

07:20.140 --> 07:22.274
Tom miller was found
a mile east

07:22.276 --> 07:24.109
Of your property
at 1:00 a.M. Tonight.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.644
Why?

07:25.646 --> 07:28.046
I don't know how to answer
any of these questions.

07:28.048 --> 07:31.116
You have been seen with
or in close proximity to

07:31.118 --> 07:33.785
Two boys from gracepoint
who have gone missing

07:33.787 --> 07:35.587
In the past six weeks.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.823
One of them is dead.

07:37.825 --> 07:40.492
The other, thankfully,
has been found.

07:40.494 --> 07:43.094
What's your connection
to them?

07:43.096 --> 07:46.832
What's your
connection to them?

07:46.834 --> 07:49.901
[siren wailing]

07:53.773 --> 07:56.475
Oh, tom.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.243
Are you okay?

07:58.245 --> 08:00.011
Oh, baby.

08:07.987 --> 08:12.090
Sweetheart, detective carver
here has a couple of questions

08:12.092 --> 08:14.125
That he needs to ask you.

08:14.127 --> 08:17.329
Are you feeling
up to that?

08:17.331 --> 08:19.164
Okay.

08:21.467 --> 08:23.335
How's your leg?

08:23.337 --> 08:25.270
They fix you up?

08:25.272 --> 08:28.340
It's not so bad.
I fell and cut it.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.375
Yeah, your mom
told me.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.944
She also told me
that you said

08:32.946 --> 08:37.315
You've never met
lars pierson.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.985
That true?
You've never met him?

08:39.987 --> 08:43.955
You ever spoken
to him?

08:43.957 --> 08:45.790
No.

08:45.792 --> 08:49.027
Has he ever tried
to contact you?

08:49.029 --> 08:50.795
No.

08:50.797 --> 08:53.164
So you were going
to his house...

08:53.166 --> 08:55.300
On your own.

08:55.302 --> 08:59.971
I got lost,
and it got dark.

08:59.973 --> 09:03.475
Sweetheart,
why did you go there?

09:03.477 --> 09:07.178
What were
you trying to do?

09:07.180 --> 09:09.481
I heard you
talking about him,

09:09.483 --> 09:11.550
So I checked
your work bag.

09:11.552 --> 09:16.054
I saw his name and his number,
so I looked him up.

09:20.826 --> 09:22.827
When was this?

09:22.829 --> 09:25.263
When you had
his picture.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.232
Looked him up where?

09:27.234 --> 09:29.768
Online.
On my computer.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.737
What were you planning to do
when you found him?

09:35.274 --> 09:37.776
I don't know.

09:37.778 --> 09:41.613
Why did you have
one of danny's crossword books

09:41.615 --> 09:43.915
In your backpack?

09:43.917 --> 09:46.184
He left it over
at our house last spring

09:46.186 --> 09:47.919
When he slept over.

09:47.921 --> 09:52.090
I keep it with me
to remember him.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.391
I just wanted
to find the person

09:53.393 --> 09:55.860
Who might've killed
my friend.

09:55.862 --> 09:59.064
I wanted
to show it to him.

09:59.066 --> 10:01.700
What would that
have done?

10:01.702 --> 10:04.703
I don't know.
Make him feel bad?

10:04.705 --> 10:07.906
Made him
tell the truth?

10:07.908 --> 10:10.041
I just wanted
to help solve the case,

10:10.043 --> 10:11.876
For danny.

10:11.878 --> 10:13.411
Also...

10:13.413 --> 10:15.280
Also what?

10:17.617 --> 10:20.051
I wanted my mom back.

10:38.738 --> 10:40.505
Detective carver.

10:40.507 --> 10:42.307
Mark, what you
still doing out?

10:42.309 --> 10:44.009
Did you get anything
from pierson?

10:44.011 --> 10:45.744
Not a lot.

10:45.746 --> 10:50.315
Do you think he had anything
to do with tom going missing?

10:50.317 --> 10:53.652
Well, do you think
he killed danny?

10:53.654 --> 10:55.787
I just don't want you wasting
your time on the wrong guy

10:55.789 --> 10:57.422
When, you know, the guy
that you're after

10:57.424 --> 11:00.258
Could be right
in front of us.

11:00.260 --> 11:03.261
Is there something specific
you want to tell me?

11:03.263 --> 11:04.663
Is it strange to you
that paul coates

11:04.665 --> 11:06.164
Found tom's bicycle,

11:06.166 --> 11:07.832
And then he's the one
who found tom

11:07.834 --> 11:09.601
Eight hours later?

11:09.603 --> 11:11.770
I mean, is it strange to you
that he takes every opportunity

11:11.772 --> 11:14.606
That he can get to put himself
in front of a camera?

11:14.608 --> 11:16.307
And I know that you're
probably gonna think

11:16.309 --> 11:18.276
That this is meaningless,
but is it strange to you

11:18.278 --> 11:19.711
That he's in love
with my wife,

11:19.713 --> 11:21.346
Has been
for the last 20 years,

11:21.348 --> 11:22.947
Ever since the beginning
of high school?

11:22.949 --> 11:24.949
That's not necessarily
meaningless.

11:24.951 --> 11:27.886
Because he hates that
me and beth are together.

11:27.888 --> 11:30.689
He hates
that we're a family.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.157
Okay.
There's--
there's one more

11:32.159 --> 11:34.225
Thing that
you should know.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.960
A client of mine saw him

11:35.962 --> 11:37.796
At a narcotics
anonymous meeting

11:37.798 --> 11:40.131
Over in winstead
last week.

11:40.133 --> 11:43.668
The minister
goes to n.A. Meetings?

11:43.670 --> 11:46.805
Might be worth
looking into.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.540
All right.

11:55.681 --> 11:57.182
You don't have to go,
you know.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.550
You can wait
if you want.

11:58.552 --> 12:01.419
Wait for what?
To get even more behind?

12:01.421 --> 12:02.887
I'm meeting jess
at the corner.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.823
She hasn't eaten.
I'm not hungry.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.758
Just have a piece
of toast or a banana.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.227
I'm fine.
I'll see you guys later.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.929
Bye, <i>mija.</i>
<i>Bye.</i>

12:10.931 --> 12:14.265
Want me
to pick you up?

12:14.267 --> 12:16.401
Well, guess
she's all right.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.503
God, I hope so.
Will you be?

12:18.505 --> 12:19.671
Back at work?

12:19.673 --> 12:21.339
I'm always all right.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.441
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna go see your mom?

12:23.443 --> 12:25.543
I might to try
to reach ellie, actually,

12:25.545 --> 12:27.378
Tell her how happy
I am about tom.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.580
That's nice.

12:28.582 --> 12:31.783
Do you think so,
or is it...

12:31.785 --> 12:33.284
Is it what?

12:33.286 --> 12:36.221
I don't know.
I don't know what it is.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.089
<i>What's going on?</i>

12:40.025 --> 12:41.860
I don't know.
It's hard, mark.

12:41.862 --> 12:44.195
It's just so...

12:46.966 --> 12:48.800
They get him back.

12:48.802 --> 12:53.204
Oh, I know.
I know.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.974
I know.

12:55.976 --> 13:01.279
Well, it kind
of gave us a purpose...

13:01.281 --> 13:03.948
You know,
searching for him.

13:03.950 --> 13:07.051
We still don't know
what happened with danny.

13:09.421 --> 13:12.557
Have you thought
more about the baby?

13:16.262 --> 13:18.396
Have a good day
at work.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.665
Tell vince
I say hi.

13:30.609 --> 13:32.010
[sighs]

13:32.012 --> 13:34.245
Well,
he's finally sleeping.

13:36.015 --> 13:38.383
You look like you could use
some sleep yourself.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.088
Listen, emmett, um,
I just really wanted

13:44.090 --> 13:47.192
To thank you
for your concern

13:47.194 --> 13:48.426
And devotion
over these--

13:48.428 --> 13:50.361
Don't call me emmett.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.297
Why? You...

13:52.299 --> 13:54.299
Called me ellie
only a few hours ago.

13:54.301 --> 13:55.433
I shouldn't
have done that.

13:55.435 --> 13:58.002
Inappropriate.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.470
Did anyone ever
tell you

13:59.472 --> 14:02.340
You tend to run
a little hot and cold?

14:02.342 --> 14:04.609
No.
Really?

14:04.611 --> 14:06.211
I've heard
the cold part.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.446
You working today,
or you taking the day off?

14:08.448 --> 14:09.714
Well...

14:09.716 --> 14:12.317
Forensic analysis
from the burnt-out boat.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.185
Blood, hair,
and prints from danny.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.288
Paint chips match the color
of danny's skateboard.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.557
Why would they have danny's
skateboard on that boat?

14:19.559 --> 14:21.492
Traces of ammonia
from a glass cleaning product

14:21.494 --> 14:24.495
Matching with the product
also used on danny's body.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.631
The killer apparently tried
to wash off any evidence

14:26.633 --> 14:28.199
After moving him
down the coast.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.401
Using glass cleaner?
Did they--

14:30.403 --> 14:32.070
You think they found it
at the hut?

14:32.072 --> 14:34.372
Yeah. Grabbing
whatever was close.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.907
Stealing a boat
from the beach.

14:35.909 --> 14:39.010
They weren't prepared
for whatever happened there.

14:39.012 --> 14:41.980
Also I found out
something interesting

14:41.982 --> 14:44.916
About our local minister.

14:44.918 --> 14:47.552
You know he goes
to narcotics anonymous meetings?

14:47.554 --> 14:48.920
Paul coates does?

14:48.922 --> 14:52.590
Yeah, drives up north
all the way to winstead.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.826
Guess I'm
working today.

15:10.409 --> 15:11.876
Renee?

15:11.878 --> 15:14.846
Hi. What are you doing
sleeping in your car?

15:17.116 --> 15:20.118
[disorienting music]

15:20.120 --> 15:28.192
â™ª

15:40.639 --> 15:42.941
Lengthy theoretical
discussions,

15:42.943 --> 15:45.710
Each of which is built
around a recurring theme:

15:45.712 --> 15:49.547
Guilt, sin, isolation.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.482
<i>And when you're working</i>
<i>on your reports,</i>

15:51.484 --> 15:53.785
<i>I'd like you to focus on...</i>

15:53.787 --> 15:55.987
[voice fades]

15:59.825 --> 16:02.293
I wonder if I could
ask you a favor.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.494
Sure.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.797
You told me you were
still in touch

16:05.799 --> 16:07.999
With one of the mothers
from rosemont.

16:08.001 --> 16:12.603
Yeah, yeah, um...
Kate blanchard, nina's mom.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.405
We, uh, we actually got to be
pretty close.

16:14.407 --> 16:17.175
If she'd be willing,
I would--

16:17.177 --> 16:19.844
I would--I'd like
to talk to her.

16:19.846 --> 16:23.514
I just--I thought
it might help

16:23.516 --> 16:25.917
To talk to someone who knows
what I'm going through,

16:25.919 --> 16:31.723
Who knows what
happens to us now.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.361
Oh, man, I think
we're gonna have to

16:36.363 --> 16:37.829
Replace this whole thing.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.864
We should probably check
the other ones too, right?

16:39.866 --> 16:42.100
All right, I'll cut the water
and turn off the boiler.

16:53.212 --> 16:54.512
<i>You okay, bro?</i>

16:57.383 --> 16:58.683
<i>Hey, mark!</i>

16:58.685 --> 17:00.218
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.620
You can handle this,
right?

17:02.622 --> 17:04.622
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

17:04.624 --> 17:06.190
I need a favor.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.159
Will you check your archives
over the last, say,

17:08.161 --> 17:09.527
25 years for a mention

17:09.529 --> 17:12.797
Of either ruth erlick
or susan wright?

17:12.799 --> 17:15.299
They're the same person,
I think.

17:15.301 --> 17:16.701
Well, if you put
your paper online,

17:16.703 --> 17:18.669
I'd be able
to check it myself.

17:18.671 --> 17:21.873
We are in the 21st century,
you know.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.207
There's a bottle
of scotch for you

17:23.209 --> 17:24.542
If you come up
with anything.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.144
Thanks, babe.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.413
Hey.
You busy?

17:28.415 --> 17:29.847
Hmm. I was gonna--

17:29.849 --> 17:31.582
Make some calls for me
before you go.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.718
Let's find out
who susan wright really is.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.353
Yes, boss.

17:35.355 --> 17:39.257
Hey, has ms. Clemons tried to
sink her teeth into you yet?

17:39.259 --> 17:40.992
She already did
a few weeks ago.

17:40.994 --> 17:42.326
There's an image
I didn't need.

17:42.328 --> 17:43.928
Since she showed
back up.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.064
I haven't decided whether
to call her back or not.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.833
Maybe don't.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.069
Owen.
Yeah.

17:51.071 --> 17:53.104
Give tom a hug
for me.

17:53.106 --> 17:55.506
Yeah, I will.

17:55.508 --> 17:56.707
Paul coates--

17:56.709 --> 17:58.176
After he became of-the-cloth,

17:58.178 --> 18:00.244
He landed at a midsize parish
in spokane.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.612
The current priest
there said

18:01.614 --> 18:03.781
That paul's few years
were good ones.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.451
But I tracked down
a board member who told me

18:06.453 --> 18:09.253
That paul got into a bar fight
with one of the congregants.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.788
Spent a month in rehab,

18:10.790 --> 18:14.125
Then quietly transitioned
over here to gracepoint.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.927
Smaller church.
His hometown.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.929
Everyone happy
to see him back.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.797
Regular contact
with danny.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.632
Insomniac.
Alcoholic.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.434
Pill popper,
or lord knows what else.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.902
Tendency
towards violence.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.904
What's the motive?

18:26.906 --> 18:28.706
Let's go see
what he has to say.

18:31.643 --> 18:34.645
(paul)
have I ever been
on owen's boat?

18:34.647 --> 18:36.781
He took me out
on it last summer,

18:36.783 --> 18:38.483
Maybe end of July.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.418
So you knew where
he kept it locked up.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.619
<i>If it was</i>

18:41.621 --> 18:43.988
Still in the same place,
then yes.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.990
Can you tell us how long
you've been going

18:45.992 --> 18:48.726
To narcotics anonymous?

18:48.728 --> 18:51.496
Oh,
I understand now.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.331
I complained
about how you failed

18:53.333 --> 18:54.565
To protect jack reinhold,

18:54.567 --> 18:56.067
And you come after me.

18:56.069 --> 18:57.568
What drugs
do you take?

18:57.570 --> 19:00.505
I haven't taken anything
in 3 years and 47 days,

19:00.507 --> 19:02.507
Every one of them
I am grateful for.

19:02.509 --> 19:04.408
Right, what drugs
did you take?

19:04.410 --> 19:05.810
Not that it's
any of your business,

19:05.812 --> 19:07.845
But I had a bad back,

19:07.847 --> 19:10.314
And I realized,
at some point,

19:10.316 --> 19:12.517
I was drinking
and taking too many painkillers,

19:12.519 --> 19:14.285
So I got help,
and I stopped.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.354
Were you drinking
and taking painkillers

19:16.356 --> 19:18.990
When you got in a bar fight
in washington state?

19:18.992 --> 19:22.960
I was assaulted
at the local tavern.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.595
I'd said something
in my sermon

19:24.597 --> 19:26.864
That a churchgoer
found objectionable,

19:26.866 --> 19:28.366
<i>So he attacked me.</i>

19:28.368 --> 19:31.202
Sound familiar?

19:31.204 --> 19:34.438
Can you tell us
why you were the one

19:34.440 --> 19:38.643
To find both tom miller's bike
and then tom himself?

19:38.645 --> 19:41.679
Sir, we are
very grateful--
let him answer.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.315
All I can say
is that as soon as I heard

19:44.317 --> 19:46.651
Another child was missing,
I started searching.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.986
I was out all day
and half the night,

19:48.988 --> 19:51.122
And I wouldn't have stopped
until he was found.

19:51.124 --> 19:52.723
Is he always this awful?

19:52.725 --> 19:55.693
You have no alibi
for the night of danny's death.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.329
Why would I kill
that boy, hmm?

19:58.331 --> 20:01.699
What possible reason
can you dream up for me

20:01.701 --> 20:04.802
To murder
a 12-year-old child?

20:04.804 --> 20:07.371
All right.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.540
We'd appreciate it
if you'd come in to the station

20:09.542 --> 20:12.210
And provide a dna sample.

20:20.719 --> 20:23.254
(beth)
thank you for meeting me.

20:23.256 --> 20:26.490
Renee told me
detective carver

20:26.492 --> 20:27.758
<i>Is in charge</i>
<i>of danny's case.</i>

20:27.760 --> 20:29.093
Yeah, he is.

20:29.095 --> 20:31.829
Don't believe
anything he says.

20:31.831 --> 20:35.933
He lost evidence.
Botched the trial.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.936
Whoever killed my nina
is still out there

20:38.938 --> 20:42.406
Because of him.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.442
I'm sorry.

20:44.444 --> 20:47.545
Maybe he'll do
better for you.

20:47.547 --> 20:53.517
I keep--I wish that there was
a--a guidebook for this.

20:55.787 --> 20:58.122
My husband
went back to work.

20:58.124 --> 21:01.058
The men all do that.
Keep busy.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.727
Don't have to think
that way.

21:02.729 --> 21:07.131
It doesn't feel right.
Working doesn't feel right.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.367
My daughter
is back at school.

21:09.369 --> 21:13.237
I wish I had the answer.

21:13.239 --> 21:19.243
I tried going back to work.
It all felt so pointless.

21:19.245 --> 21:24.115
So your days are--

21:24.117 --> 21:26.250
What do you do?

21:26.252 --> 21:30.221
Honestly, I go to bed.

21:30.223 --> 21:32.556
I dream.
I get up.

21:32.558 --> 21:35.626
It's all still the same,
so I have a drink,

21:35.628 --> 21:37.662
And then I have
another drink,

21:37.664 --> 21:39.830
<i>And then I cry maybe</i>
<i>a couple hours.</i>

21:39.832 --> 21:43.401
<i>And then I watch tv,</i>
<i>unless it reminds me of nina,</i>

21:43.403 --> 21:45.236
Which it does nearly
all of the time

21:45.238 --> 21:46.604
In the craziest ways,

21:46.606 --> 21:50.608
So I take
a sleeping pill.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.910
I go to bed.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.615
I'm sorry.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.350
You probably came here
looking for answers,

21:59.352 --> 22:02.320
And I don't have them.

22:02.322 --> 22:07.124
My life got stolen from me
that day.

22:07.126 --> 22:11.095
I can't get back
from that.

22:44.896 --> 22:46.097

24:24.730 --> 24:25.796
â™ª I--

24:32.304 --> 24:35.739
Hi, mom.
Dad.

24:35.741 --> 24:37.408
What the hell
are you doing?

24:38.810 --> 24:40.644
Dancing.

24:42.514 --> 24:46.250
Did you eat or drink
anything in the last hour?

24:46.252 --> 24:47.318
No.

24:50.422 --> 24:52.122
So what,
religion took over

24:52.124 --> 24:55.793
For the drinking
and the pills?

24:55.795 --> 24:57.695
You swap one addiction
for another?

24:57.697 --> 25:02.266
You really enjoy trying
to rile me up, don't you?

25:04.269 --> 25:06.637
Tell me about your relationship
with beth solano

25:06.639 --> 25:08.772
In high school.

25:08.774 --> 25:13.544
Beth and I were--
we were very close friends.

25:13.546 --> 25:17.214
I had my first kiss with her,
if you must know.

25:19.951 --> 25:23.787
What have you got
against me?

25:23.789 --> 25:26.557
I'm just trying
to understand.

25:26.559 --> 25:28.459
You were so eager
to insert yourself

25:28.461 --> 25:30.528
Into that family's grief,

25:30.530 --> 25:32.129
Get yourself in front
of the cameras

25:32.131 --> 25:34.298
When this all kicked off,

25:34.300 --> 25:37.234
Like you wanted
to own it,

25:37.236 --> 25:38.903
Claim it
for the church.

25:38.905 --> 25:40.905
Wow.
Tragedy ups
the numbers, right?

25:40.907 --> 25:44.308
People start piling in.

25:44.310 --> 25:46.343
Rest of the time,
you're just that building

25:46.345 --> 25:47.745
No one goes into.

25:47.747 --> 25:51.415
You have...No concept
of faith, do you?

25:51.417 --> 25:53.551
I was happy
with what I had here,

25:53.553 --> 25:55.419
A small but loyal
congregation.

25:55.421 --> 25:58.656
It was good.
It was god's will.

25:58.658 --> 26:02.726
I didn't muscle in.
The town turned to me.

26:02.728 --> 26:05.896
People who wouldn't normally
even think about religion,

26:05.898 --> 26:07.831
They asked me to speak.

26:07.833 --> 26:11.769
They needed me.

26:11.771 --> 26:15.573
And do you know
why they came?

26:15.575 --> 26:20.177
Because there was a fear
that you couldn't address,

26:20.179 --> 26:22.112
A need
that you only made worse

26:22.114 --> 26:26.016
Because all you have
is suspicion.

26:28.286 --> 26:32.590
Now, you can accuse me.
You can take dna samples.

26:32.592 --> 26:35.225
You can ridicule
who I was in the past,

26:35.227 --> 26:38.362
But you don't get
to belittle my faith

26:38.364 --> 26:39.897
Just because
you're too shut down

26:39.899 --> 26:42.466
To comprehend it.

26:42.468 --> 26:44.034
People need hope
right now,

26:44.036 --> 26:46.870
And they are certainly not
getting it from you.

26:49.307 --> 26:51.508
Are we done?

26:53.478 --> 26:56.046
Dean said I forgot
how to pursue my happiness.

26:56.048 --> 26:57.648
(mark)
what does that mean?

26:57.650 --> 26:59.883
I just wanted to give
your daughter a couple hours

26:59.885 --> 27:02.119
Where she could be
herself again.

27:02.121 --> 27:05.489
You know, let loose
without feeling guilty.

27:05.491 --> 27:07.625
He put a whole playlist
on the jukebox

27:07.627 --> 27:10.160
And made his
grandmother's chili.

27:10.162 --> 27:13.130
Chloe, sweetie,
what happened at school?

27:13.132 --> 27:15.799
Everybody either looked at me
like I was a freak

27:15.801 --> 27:20.170
Or just turned away 'cause
they didn't know what to say.

27:20.172 --> 27:25.342
I called dean and begged him
to come get me.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.177
I loved danny.

27:27.179 --> 27:30.681
You know I loved him,
but...

27:30.683 --> 27:34.852
I need a break from being
the dead kid's sister.

27:34.854 --> 27:38.022
And it's like
I'm buried under it,

27:38.024 --> 27:41.025
And I know that you can't
understand that.

27:41.027 --> 27:42.926
We do understand.

27:45.130 --> 27:47.531
Right?
Yes, yes,

27:47.533 --> 27:49.767
Yes, we do.

27:53.938 --> 27:57.541
Are you keeping
the baby?

27:57.543 --> 27:59.476
How do you know
about that?

27:59.478 --> 28:00.678
Mom, I live
in our house.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.413
I hear you guys fighting
about it.

28:07.552 --> 28:11.622
We don't know yet.

28:11.624 --> 28:14.224
But right now,

28:14.226 --> 28:18.262
I just want to make sure
that my first baby is okay.

28:21.900 --> 28:25.736
Can't let dean be the only one
looking out for you.

28:25.738 --> 28:27.805
Yeah?

28:35.246 --> 28:36.714
<i>(ellie)</i>
<i>this is nuts.</i>

28:36.716 --> 28:38.048
We don't have
any choice.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.818
We've got nothing
to charge him with.

28:40.820 --> 28:43.921
He was in a campground
50 miles south of gracepoint

28:43.923 --> 28:46.090
The night
danny was killed.

28:46.092 --> 28:48.258
Tom says
he never met him.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.227
County will take care
of the weapons possession.

28:50.229 --> 28:53.230
At least we'll know
where to find him.

28:53.232 --> 28:57.735
<i>(ellie)</i>
<i>something doesn't make sense</i>
<i>about all this.</i>

28:57.737 --> 29:00.838
I just don't know
what it is.

29:00.840 --> 29:04.975
I really hate
letting him go.

29:09.280 --> 29:11.348
You and me both.

29:16.454 --> 29:19.456
[waves rushing]

29:19.458 --> 29:22.459

29:52.290 --> 29:53.791
Wait!

29:53.793 --> 29:56.894
Get away from there!

30:00.098 --> 30:01.732
Stay away
from the edge!

30:01.734 --> 30:04.401

30:08.506 --> 30:09.506
Oh, god.

30:09.508 --> 30:12.576
[hyperventilating]

30:32.831 --> 30:35.799
I love you so much,

30:35.801 --> 30:38.635
And I'm gonna give you a call
in just a little bit

30:38.637 --> 30:41.638
To check up on you,
okay?

30:41.640 --> 30:42.840
You have everything
you need?

30:42.842 --> 30:44.875
Yup.
Okay.

30:44.877 --> 30:47.678
And I love you.

30:47.680 --> 30:50.047
Now, uh, keys.

30:50.049 --> 30:54.284
Um...I'll be home
as soon as I can, okay?

30:54.286 --> 30:55.419
Bye.

31:00.024 --> 31:02.726
I made it worse for her,
didn't I?

31:02.728 --> 31:04.561
I didn't mean to.

31:04.563 --> 31:07.431
I know you didn't,
tommy.

31:14.305 --> 31:16.640
We can't
bring danny back.

31:22.680 --> 31:26.583
[upbeat pop music]

31:26.585 --> 31:29.019
You better be good if you're
gonna miss school for this.

You hear me?
<i>Yes.</i>

Do I do it?

32:22.975 --> 32:24.808
Go ahead.

32:24.810 --> 32:26.476
Really?

32:26.478 --> 32:29.379

How good
of a bowler am I?

32:58.944 --> 33:00.177
Yeah.

33:00.179 --> 33:01.979
We were just saying
you were great.

33:01.981 --> 33:03.347
Ah! Yeah, yeah.
You know what?

33:03.349 --> 33:04.848
At least I know
when to give up.

33:04.850 --> 33:06.750
You know what would happen
if danny was here?

33:06.752 --> 33:08.785
Yeah, he'd
make us stay.
Yeah, until we beat you.

33:08.787 --> 33:10.354
And you would be
on your 19th milkshake.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.990
Hey!
I only had two.

33:12.992 --> 33:14.524
Also some fries
and a hot dog.

33:14.526 --> 33:17.527
And onion rings.
So what?

33:17.529 --> 33:19.463
You're working on your
own kind of record, right?

33:19.465 --> 33:21.031
What? What?
What?
You're so mean.

33:21.033 --> 33:22.366
Can I have a sip?
Yeah.

Okay.

[squeals]
[shouts]
no!

33:25.004 --> 33:28.872
It's calcium.
It's for the baby.

33:28.874 --> 33:30.707
It's for what?

33:30.709 --> 33:32.175
I said it's
for the baby.

33:32.177 --> 33:34.344
It's good for it.

33:37.048 --> 33:39.449
All right.
Well, then drink up then.

How's your leg doing?

34:41.947 --> 34:44.414
It's not so bad.

34:44.416 --> 34:47.584
I brought you something
I thought you might want.

34:49.387 --> 34:51.188
Do you know
what this is?

34:54.425 --> 34:56.426
That's danny's.
That's right.

34:56.428 --> 34:59.229
I've been looking
after it.

34:59.231 --> 35:02.032
But since you were
his friend,

35:02.034 --> 35:03.467
I thought
you should have it.

35:03.469 --> 35:06.036
It's only right.

35:06.038 --> 35:08.338
What do you think?
Do you want it?

What?

35:28.127 --> 35:29.126
Put that down.

But I-it's danny's.

35:30.162 --> 35:31.628
Put it down.

35:31.630 --> 35:32.629

36:28.619 --> 36:31.821
Thanks for stopping by,
ms. Wright.

36:31.823 --> 36:33.557
We did a little
digging on you.

36:33.559 --> 36:35.125
So what?

36:35.127 --> 36:38.795
About your husband
and your children

36:38.797 --> 36:40.397
And what everyone
said about you

36:40.399 --> 36:41.831
But could never prove.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.633
What do you want
from me?

36:43.635 --> 36:45.001
You threatened me.

36:45.003 --> 36:46.303
I want you to know
that I'm the one

36:46.305 --> 36:48.338
Who tipped off
the police,

36:48.340 --> 36:50.040
In case you were
wondering.

36:50.042 --> 36:51.708
Isn't that right,
detectives?

36:54.912 --> 36:57.147
Hey, boy.

36:57.149 --> 36:59.182
You remember me,
right?

36:59.184 --> 37:02.219
She left you out here
all alone, huh?

37:02.221 --> 37:03.386
That's no good.

37:03.388 --> 37:04.888
We can't have that.
Come on.

37:04.890 --> 37:05.989

an attorney,

37:05.991 --> 37:07.891

<i>How you feeling?</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

Good. You're not calling me

37:36.121 --> 37:37.354
No, I'm home.

37:37.356 --> 37:39.856
Good, stay there.

37:39.858 --> 37:42.225
Hey, can I ask you
a question?

37:42.227 --> 37:44.694
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>
<i>Go ahead.</i>

37:44.696 --> 37:47.797
If you delete something
from a hard drive,

37:47.799 --> 37:49.766
Is it gone forever?

37:49.768 --> 37:52.102
Because my--my dad
deleted something and--

37:52.104 --> 37:54.437
Well, they have those data
recovery programs,

37:54.439 --> 37:55.972
But if that doesn't work,

37:55.974 --> 37:58.074
You can always get a tech guy
to get it back.

37:58.076 --> 37:59.576
I might have a number
for you.

37:59.578 --> 38:01.211
No, thanks.
I'll let you know, though.

38:01.213 --> 38:02.379
<i>Okay.</i>

38:02.381 --> 38:04.147
Well, you rest up,
all right?

38:04.149 --> 38:06.883
I'll, uh, I'll
talk to you soon.

38:06.885 --> 38:08.385
<i>Bye.</i>
<i>Bye.</i>

38:14.925 --> 38:18.628
Why did you have
danny solano's skateboard?

38:20.965 --> 38:26.136
Why did you give danny solano's
skateboard to tom miller?

38:27.405 --> 38:29.773
What's your
favorite color?

38:29.775 --> 38:32.942
I want to see my dog.

38:32.944 --> 38:36.246
I'm not talking to you
till I see my dog.

38:36.248 --> 38:38.615
Oh, we're bargaining now,
are we?

38:38.617 --> 38:40.684
That's your choice.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.254
I see.
