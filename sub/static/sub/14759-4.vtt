saw Chloe Holloway?

07:26.067 --> 07:28.233
At the party in the forest.

07:28.267 --> 07:29.800
We drove up there together.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.467
Chloe wanted to stop off.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.400
She had packets on her.

07:35.433 --> 07:36.433
Packets of what?

07:37.833 --> 07:39.533
Drugs.

07:39.567 --> 07:41.067

07:41.067 --> 07:42.700
She had packets in the car.

07:42.733 --> 07:45.533
-I think it was ecstasy.
-How did you know
it was ecstasy?

07:45.567 --> 07:47.633
She was saving up
to leave town.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.200
I think she was
selling for someone.

answered the question,
Miss Macy.

was ecstasy?

-It's my father's dog.
-Why would you do that?

08:12.667 --> 08:14.167
I had jetlag. I needed a walk.

did you leave the party?

08:15.767 --> 08:17.367

around 12:00.

08:17.400 --> 08:18.567
ANNA: I walked.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.433
-DUTCH: That's a long walk.
-Bit of a blur, really.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.133
-DUTCH: What do you
mean by "blur"?
-As I said, I was jetlagged.

08:22.167 --> 08:23.533
-DUTCH: What time
did get home?
-I didn't check the time.

08:23.567 --> 08:25.500
DUTCH: How did Chloe seem when
you left her?

08:25.533 --> 08:27.700
ANNA: Seem?
DUTCH: What was
her state of mind?

08:29.400 --> 08:30.733
ANNA: She was intoxicated.

08:30.767 --> 08:32.467
DUTCH: Remind me.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.233
You took the dog for a walk.
What time did you get home
from the walk?

08:34.267 --> 08:35.600
-Around 4:00.
-You checked

08:35.633 --> 08:37.067
what time you got home
from walking the dog?

08:37.067 --> 08:38.067
-Yes.

into the interview room.

-We're just doing our job,
okay?

We have to talk to everyone
who was at the party.

there with her.

No one's been arrested,
all right?

a lawyer, Roy.

you off the island?

what happened.

Chloe were fighting about at

No, that's not true.

10:03.833 --> 10:05.233

10:06.100 --> 10:07.267
Isn't it?

I don't see what this has got
to do with Chloe.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.367
I think it has everything
to do with it.

10:21.767 --> 10:23.267
Anna, wait.

10:25.067 --> 10:27.700
You just said in the interview
that you left the party
at 12:00

10:27.733 --> 10:29.900
and a few days ago, you told
me you got home at 11:00.

10:29.933 --> 10:31.567

What's the difference?

It's a big bloody difference.

were down at the wharf?

everything you do?

They're looking for you,

32:41.500 --> 32:43.633
The coroner believes that
Chloe's death

32:43.667 --> 32:45.533
was probably caused by trauma.

32:47.767 --> 32:48.767
Trauma?

32:49.567 --> 32:50.800
An impact to the head.

32:51.833 --> 32:53.333
Oh, God.

32:54.233 --> 32:55.367
Oh, no.

32:56.567 --> 32:58.233
So it was murder?

32:58.267 --> 33:01.267
I don't think we should jump
to any conclusions.

33:01.300 --> 33:05.300
The coroner says there was
evidence of skin
discolouration.

33:05.333 --> 33:07.067
-Was she ill at all?
-No, she wasn't ill.

33:07.067 --> 33:08.200
She was fine.

33:08.233 --> 33:09.933
And what about her mood?
Did she seem depressed,

33:09.967 --> 33:12.367
or low on
the night of the party?

33:14.267 --> 33:16.067
I didn't see her.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.867

the autopsy has to be
a part of the process.

33:30.167 --> 33:31.300

You don't want to see her
like this.

33:33.067 --> 33:34.267
You really don't.

33:37.633 --> 33:39.933
Can you think of anyone,

33:39.967 --> 33:42.700
anyone that may have wished
Chloe harm?

33:43.933 --> 33:45.133
No.

33:45.967 --> 33:47.600
Did she mention anything?

33:48.733 --> 33:51.100
Think back. Any arguments?

33:51.133 --> 33:52.767
Words she may have had with
someone?

33:52.800 --> 33:56.200
She had a big mouth, like
me, but no one hated her.

33:57.067 --> 33:58.533
You know what she was like.

34:05.500 --> 34:06.667

-I don't know.

34:42.067 --> 34:43.100

34:43.133 --> 34:44.300
