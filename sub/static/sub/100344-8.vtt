I could be the witness
who puts a spotlight
on this thing's existence,

05:00.292 --> 05:02.709
killing Frankie Peterson,
it had to run,

05:02.793 --> 05:05.626
because of the reinvestigation
it knew had to happen.

05:05.709 --> 05:08.209
I think it needs to stay
in one place

05:08.292 --> 05:10.292
for weeks at a time
after it kills

05:10.376 --> 05:12.834
to regain strength to complete
the transformation,

05:12.917 --> 05:15.292
but it had to run
before it was ready

05:15.376 --> 05:16.834
when it was too weak
to fend for itself,

05:16.917 --> 05:18.917

before it strikes again...

05:25.042 --> 05:27.668

how do we know

-who it becomes next?

05:50.084 --> 05:53.167
so to be with him
before this thing
starts to kill in his name

05:55.501 --> 05:57.209

if he had more than one eye-wit
to verify his whereabouts,

06:12.959 --> 06:15.875

12:07.251 --> 12:10.042
You know, Jack...

12:10.125 --> 12:14.042
he told me once over copious
amounts of cocktails...

12:14.125 --> 12:16.251
that all he ever wanted to do
when he was a kid

12:16.334 --> 12:18.376
was to, um,
take his hunting skills

12:18.459 --> 12:21.000
and become a sharp-shooter
in the military.

12:21.084 --> 12:26.417
Right? So, he enlists at 18,
he goes through basic training,

12:26.501 --> 12:28.668
where he tops his class
in the firing range,

12:28.751 --> 12:30.709
which qualifies him then
to go to sniper school,

12:30.793 --> 12:32.584
where, once again,
he tops the class.

12:32.668 --> 12:35.917
So, his life-long dream
has become reality.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.751
And he's waiting to find out
where they're gonna deploy him

12:38.834 --> 12:41.584
and all he has to do
is go through one last round

12:41.668 --> 12:43.959
of mandatory psych evaluations.

12:45.292 --> 12:46.376
Please don't tell me.
