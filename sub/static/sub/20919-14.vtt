WEBVTT

00:05.523 --> 00:08.782
[male driver] Hydra should know by now.
[tires screeching]

00:08.859 --> 00:10.801
Never mess with a Stark.

00:10.878 --> 00:13.378
[tires screeching] Aah!

00:13.455 --> 00:16.030
[chuckles] Always wondered
what Mary's top speed was.

00:16.033 --> 00:19.959
Really, Howard? [Grunting] Aah!

00:20.037 --> 00:21.887
You named your car
after a girlfriend?

00:21.963 --> 00:25.632
Ex-girlfriend. But point
taken, Special Agent Carter.

00:25.709 --> 00:28.149
I'll rename the car after we
deliver the package in the trunk.

00:34.385 --> 00:36.051
If we deliver
the package in the trunk.

00:36.053 --> 00:38.162
You need a ride across town?
Take a cab.

00:44.061 --> 00:45.861
These ain't your run-of-the-mill
Hydra agents.

00:47.656 --> 00:49.790
[grunts] [tires screeching]

00:51.235 --> 00:52.009
[gasps]

00:52.086 --> 00:53.126
[grunts]

00:56.998 --> 00:58.078
Howard, it's about to blow!

01:06.417 --> 01:07.417
[tires screeching]

01:12.106 --> 01:13.480
[grunts]

01:16.184 --> 01:18.594
Peg, are you hurt?

01:18.596 --> 01:20.095
[chuckles]
No. No, of course you're not.

01:20.097 --> 01:24.116
Now, what was that?
And how did we not get blown up?

01:24.192 --> 01:27.119
Howard, I don't think
we're in 1949 anymore.

01:29.623 --> 01:32.198
I'm surprised to see you here, Tony.
New Year's Eve.

01:32.276 --> 01:35.961
Figured you'd be out at a party
or on a date or something.

01:36.037 --> 01:37.704
I used to love
New Year's Eve, Cap.

01:37.781 --> 01:40.240
All that wild, nonstop partying
until the break of dawn.

01:40.317 --> 01:42.634
Then I realized something.

01:42.711 --> 01:44.264
That there's more to life
than nonstop partying?

01:44.288 --> 01:47.139
What? No. Uh, are you crazy? No.

01:47.215 --> 01:52.218
I realized that every night for me
is nonstop partying, because I'm me.

01:52.296 --> 01:53.962
I can party every other
night of the year,

01:53.964 --> 01:57.407
but tonight I'm close to a
breakthrough on th... [alarm blares]

01:57.484 --> 01:59.151
[beeps]

01:59.227 --> 02:01.970
Picking up an energy signature.

02:01.972 --> 02:04.306
Someone in Central Park is using
unauthorized Stark technology.

02:04.308 --> 02:08.243
Being an Avenger...
Always a nonstop party.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:17.655 --> 02:19.988
Car crash.

02:19.990 --> 02:22.174
But that wouldn't cause
those energy readings.

02:22.250 --> 02:26.270
Whoa! Whoa! I don't know
what's going on here,

02:26.346 --> 02:28.324
but I know I'll feel a lot better if you
two in the costumes take a few steps back.

02:28.348 --> 02:30.515
Steve?

02:30.592 --> 02:32.109
Peggy?

02:32.186 --> 02:33.669
Captain America?

02:33.671 --> 02:35.595
Howard? Dad?

02:35.673 --> 02:38.006
"Dad"?

02:38.008 --> 02:39.449
How is this...

02:39.526 --> 02:40.526
Possible?

02:42.270 --> 02:44.103
[both]
This is some kind of trick.

02:44.181 --> 02:45.772
My dad died a long time ago,

02:45.849 --> 02:48.292
so you must be a doppelg nger
or a shape-shifter.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.118
Drop the weapon now, pops.

02:51.855 --> 02:52.855
Howard, Tony, no!

03:06.220 --> 03:10.372
Don't wanna hurt you. Not before
I find out who you really are.

03:10.374 --> 03:12.465
And using my dad's
license plate number. Huh!

03:12.543 --> 03:14.893
Whoever you are,
you did your research.

03:14.970 --> 03:17.879
"Stark1" has always been me.

03:17.881 --> 03:19.990
Hold your fire!
Both of you, stand down!

03:22.219 --> 03:24.477
Steve Rogers? It's really you!

03:24.555 --> 03:26.888
Tony, I knew your dad.

03:26.890 --> 03:28.490
This is really him.
This is Howard Stark.

03:28.559 --> 03:33.411
Howard, Iron Man is Tony Stark.
He's your son.

03:33.488 --> 03:36.565
Dad? But how did you get here?

03:36.567 --> 03:39.843
I wish I could tell you.
I don't remember anything.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.237
Try as I can, the last
10, 12 hours are a blank.

03:42.239 --> 03:46.499
Something affected our memories.
But if I'm a betting woman,

03:46.577 --> 03:48.417
odds are good it has
something to do with this.

03:50.764 --> 03:54.841
Yep, there it is. I'm picking up
residual neutrino energy readings.

03:54.918 --> 03:56.585
Well, of course you are.

03:56.587 --> 03:58.695
[beeps] What are those?

03:58.772 --> 04:00.530
They're usually associated
with time travel.

04:00.607 --> 04:02.440
You must've come through
some sort of portal.

04:02.517 --> 04:06.611
Yeah. Well, tell me about time travel.
Why can't I remember it?

04:06.688 --> 04:10.949
In theory, if a time traveler receives a
high enough dose of subchronal energy,

04:11.026 --> 04:14.211
it could wipe
a few hours of memory.

04:14.288 --> 04:16.605
So I'm actually gonna settle
down someday and have a kid.

04:16.607 --> 04:20.550
[chuckles] I thought I'd
be a bachelor for life.

04:20.627 --> 04:22.386
Who's your mom? I-Is
it, uh... Please stop.

04:22.462 --> 04:24.629
You haven't met her yet,
and I really don't want

04:24.706 --> 04:28.633
to have this conversation
with my dad.

04:28.710 --> 04:31.061
The complexity here...
It's amazing.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.805
Yes. Yes. Ask me anything.

04:33.882 --> 04:35.957
Anything to change the topic.
All right.

04:35.959 --> 04:39.294
How'd you get so much processing
power into something this small?

04:39.296 --> 04:41.396
Data packet multitasking. It...

04:44.301 --> 04:46.468
Here. You'll appreciate this.
[beeps]

04:46.470 --> 04:50.322
Whoa. Don't tell me you
have hard-light holograms!

04:52.810 --> 04:55.493
This robot has
weird energy readings.

04:55.570 --> 04:57.754
Never seen anything
this advanced before.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.247
That makes two of us.

05:07.991 --> 05:10.249
So, how are you?

05:10.327 --> 05:11.607
I'm the one
who should be asking.

05:11.662 --> 05:16.606
Although, "Anything new?"
doesn't sound quite right.

05:16.683 --> 05:19.609
What... Where have you been?

05:19.686 --> 05:22.520
I spent most of the past
60 years frozen in ice.

05:22.597 --> 05:24.840
This world is new to me too.

05:24.842 --> 05:27.342
The last thing I remember,
it was almost 1950.

05:27.344 --> 05:31.179
After everything that happened
in the 1940s, it felt huge.

05:31.181 --> 05:34.440
I couldn't help wondering what
the new decade would bring,

05:34.518 --> 05:36.852
but I never imagined...

05:36.854 --> 05:38.128
I thought you were dead, Steve.

05:38.205 --> 05:40.464
I mourned you.

05:40.540 --> 05:42.799
The whole world mourned you.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.801
I thought I was over you.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.453
Peggy, I... But I'm here now.

05:47.531 --> 05:51.549
[Iron Man over P.A.]
Cap, Peggy, got a job for ya.

05:51.626 --> 05:52.862
We can't pull enough data
from this robot part,

05:52.886 --> 05:55.220
so I need you
to go back to the crash site.

05:55.296 --> 05:58.464
Look for anything else that
might've come through that portal.

05:58.542 --> 06:00.817
Well, let's go. It'll be
like that date we never got.

06:06.808 --> 06:09.567
You sure you wouldn't be more
comfortable on the back of my bike?

06:09.644 --> 06:10.660
[tires screeching]

06:12.981 --> 06:16.074
I'm perfectly comfortable
right here, thank you.

06:20.155 --> 06:22.822
[whirring]

06:22.900 --> 06:24.916
Tell me everything.
Like the Iron Man suit.

06:24.993 --> 06:27.010
How do you generate
that much power?

06:27.087 --> 06:28.995
It runs off this.

06:29.072 --> 06:31.740
Oh, my arc reactor.
Your arc reactor?

06:31.742 --> 06:33.925
I-I mean, I...

06:34.002 --> 06:36.019
That is, it's sort of mine now.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.355
I perfected it. Uh-huh.

06:38.432 --> 06:40.032
Perfected your old man's design.
[grunts]

06:42.419 --> 06:44.602
All right. Now, what's this?

06:44.679 --> 06:46.345
[crowd cheering]

06:46.423 --> 06:48.106
We call that a remote control.

06:48.183 --> 06:51.609
Oh. This is fascinating.

06:51.686 --> 06:53.072
Huh. I feel so powerful.
[speaking, faint]

06:53.096 --> 06:55.430
It's good to have you back, Dad.

06:55.432 --> 06:57.949
[changing channels]
So, now, tell me, Tony.

06:58.026 --> 07:00.026
Was I a good dad?

07:00.103 --> 07:02.361
[woman speaking on TV, faint]

07:02.439 --> 07:05.106
I'm a billionaire tech genius
with cars,

07:05.108 --> 07:08.201
supermodel girlfriends,
and I save the world.

07:08.278 --> 07:10.128
Huh. You taught me
everything I know.

07:10.205 --> 07:12.705
[chuckles] [TV off]

07:12.783 --> 07:15.467
Speaking of cars,
how is it that everything

07:15.543 --> 07:17.118
in the future was better
except for the cars?

07:17.120 --> 07:19.896
I wouldn't trade mine
for a single one

07:19.973 --> 07:21.117
of those ugly things
I saw out on the street.

07:21.141 --> 07:24.292
Oh, that sounds
like a challenge.

07:24.294 --> 07:26.403
Give me two hours
with your classic car,

07:26.480 --> 07:28.813
and I'll add an arc reactor
engine that will...

07:28.890 --> 07:30.240
Look out! [Grunts]

07:35.505 --> 07:37.530
Are you doing this? It's not me.

07:47.859 --> 07:48.859
[grunts]

07:51.863 --> 07:54.473
Take cover. I'll handle this.

07:54.549 --> 07:56.808
Run away? Not on your life.

07:56.885 --> 07:59.627
Then stay out of the way!

07:59.705 --> 08:03.039
Really? You're gonna talk
to your father that way?

08:03.041 --> 08:05.266
Dad! Will you just listen to me?

08:07.896 --> 08:09.729
[grunting]

08:24.913 --> 08:25.820
[gasps]

08:25.897 --> 08:27.247
[grunts]

08:31.995 --> 08:33.628
You're welcome.

08:37.909 --> 08:39.926
[sighs] The internal
circuits on this thing.

08:40.003 --> 08:42.020
Should've known.
You've seen this before?

08:42.097 --> 08:43.929
Unfortunately.

08:44.006 --> 08:45.690
I'd hoped I'd seen
the last of him.

08:45.767 --> 08:47.934
[laughing]

08:48.011 --> 08:50.511
There is no such thing
as the last of me.

08:50.589 --> 08:53.089
And there he is... Kang!

08:53.091 --> 08:55.367
Such informality.

08:55.443 --> 08:58.537
Unlike you,
I earned my title, Stark.

08:58.613 --> 09:01.188
The name is Kang the Conqueror.

09:01.266 --> 09:03.542
A friend of yours? Hardly.

09:03.618 --> 09:06.360
Kang is from
800 years in the future,

09:06.438 --> 09:07.840
where they have
perfected time travel.

09:07.864 --> 09:10.273
Howard Stark.

09:10.275 --> 09:12.033
You are a hard man to kill.

09:12.110 --> 09:17.389
I sent robot hunters disguised as
Hydra agents to your own time,

09:17.465 --> 09:20.041
and you ended up here.

09:20.118 --> 09:22.209
I can't remember what happened.

09:22.287 --> 09:24.120
I'll have to take
your word for it.

09:24.122 --> 09:29.309
In my time, I've been fighting an
irritating individual named Arno Stark.

09:29.385 --> 09:31.218
Huh? What?

09:31.296 --> 09:32.796
Your descendant.

09:32.798 --> 09:34.555
Arno Stark, huh?

09:34.633 --> 09:37.817
If he's a Stark, then he should
be able to stop the likes of you.

09:37.894 --> 09:39.319
I'm gonna have a kid?

09:39.395 --> 09:41.562
A threat to my empire

09:41.640 --> 09:43.748
who's proven to be
impossible to stop,

09:43.825 --> 09:45.917
so I've come back in time...

09:45.994 --> 09:47.994
[grunts]

09:48.071 --> 09:50.922
To destroy you.

09:50.999 --> 09:53.316
Without Howard Stark,
there is no arc reactor,

09:53.318 --> 09:55.985
no Tony Stark, no Avengers,

09:55.987 --> 09:58.321
and no Arno Stark.

09:58.323 --> 10:00.098
Nothing to stand in my way.

10:00.175 --> 10:01.341
[grunts]

10:03.829 --> 10:06.549
We need anything that might've come
through the time portal with you.

10:07.332 --> 10:09.256
Like that.

10:09.334 --> 10:12.185
[thudding] Huh?

10:12.261 --> 10:14.687
I don't remember
what that could be,

10:14.764 --> 10:18.007
but if I just
threw it in the trunk...

10:18.009 --> 10:22.120
[exclaims in German] Leaving me
in the car boot! Such indignity!

10:22.197 --> 10:23.529
Dr. Faustus?

10:23.606 --> 10:26.458
Captain America?

10:26.534 --> 10:30.353
I knew your so-called death
was a conspiracy.

10:30.355 --> 10:32.183
[cadenced voice]
Well, you will leave this place

10:32.207 --> 10:36.042
and forget I was ever here.

10:36.119 --> 10:37.710
Yeah, your mind tricks
won't work on us.

10:37.787 --> 10:39.304
They don't have to.

10:44.202 --> 10:45.760
He went that way,
toward the bridge!

10:48.373 --> 10:49.597
[panting]

10:51.893 --> 10:54.102
Huh? Hey, pops,
get off our turf.

10:56.305 --> 10:59.565
This is Phantom Riders'
territory.

10:59.642 --> 11:01.734
Yes, meine Freunde.

11:01.811 --> 11:03.144
[cadenced voice] Focus.

11:03.221 --> 11:08.391
These intruders have encroached
upon your territory.

11:08.393 --> 11:11.561
Show them what happens
to interlopers.

11:11.563 --> 11:14.005
Yeah! Yeah!

11:14.082 --> 11:15.832
[grunting, groaning]

11:19.070 --> 11:21.404
[yells]

11:21.406 --> 11:23.348
[yelling, grunting]

11:23.425 --> 11:26.910
I guess you're not gonna get
that dance today either.

11:26.912 --> 11:29.746
I'm beginning to think you don't
know how to dance, soldier.

11:29.748 --> 11:32.357
[grunting]

11:32.434 --> 11:34.600
What do you think
about my moves now?

11:34.677 --> 11:35.957
We might make good partners yet.

11:37.605 --> 11:39.197
[panting]

11:47.432 --> 11:48.448
Sorry, Dr. Faustus.

11:48.524 --> 11:51.358
That exit's closed.

11:51.436 --> 11:54.546
[yells] [grunts, groans]

11:54.622 --> 11:56.456
Really? You couldn't
save one for me?

11:56.532 --> 11:57.874
You snooze, you lose.

12:02.614 --> 12:06.115
I still don't understand how
this is even possible, Steve.

12:06.117 --> 12:08.468
Time travel?
I don't really get it either.

12:08.544 --> 12:11.563
But if anyone
can get you home, Tony can.

12:11.639 --> 12:13.479
You know, I'm not sure
I want to leave so fast.

12:15.961 --> 12:18.144
Well, I could...
I could always come with you.

12:20.131 --> 12:22.148
[weapons firing]

[grunts]

12:25.303 --> 12:26.819
[grunting]

12:28.139 --> 12:30.323
Aahh!

12:30.399 --> 12:32.039
Is that all you got,
future conqueror man?

12:34.646 --> 12:36.162
Dad! [Grunts]

12:36.239 --> 12:40.574
Boastful arrogance from one
who will soon cease to exist.

12:40.652 --> 12:42.335
You first, Kang. [Grunts]

12:44.155 --> 12:45.989
[Kang yells]

12:45.991 --> 12:47.265
[grunts]

12:47.342 --> 12:48.658
Nice work, Dad.

12:48.660 --> 12:51.160
[chuckles] Where do you
think you got your smarts?

12:51.162 --> 12:52.845
[yelling]

12:56.351 --> 12:57.442
Distance won't save you.

13:03.675 --> 13:06.785
Tony! Huh? [Yells, grunts]

13:10.515 --> 13:15.126
Incredible luck, how you managed
to escape my hunters through time.

13:15.203 --> 13:16.628
But your... [grunts] Huh?

13:16.704 --> 13:19.355
Kang the Conqueror.

13:19.357 --> 13:21.707
It's all starting
to make sense now.

13:21.784 --> 13:23.693
Actually, he prefers
just "Kang."

13:23.695 --> 13:25.361
Less talking,
more action, please.

13:25.363 --> 13:27.046
[grunting]

13:30.201 --> 13:32.013
Everything in this century
has been quite bizarre,

13:32.037 --> 13:33.553
but your clothes take the cake.

13:33.629 --> 13:36.481
[grunts]

13:40.228 --> 13:42.545
You're out of ammo, Kang.

13:42.547 --> 13:45.715
Who needs ammo?
I'll chop you down myself!

13:45.717 --> 13:47.158
[grunts] [Peggy yells]

13:47.235 --> 13:49.235
Tony!

13:51.981 --> 13:53.890
[laughing]

13:53.892 --> 13:55.408
[grunting] [growling]

13:55.484 --> 13:56.817
[grunts]

13:56.895 --> 13:59.562
[yells]

13:59.564 --> 14:01.414
[grunts] Coward!

14:03.568 --> 14:06.752
[grunts]

14:06.829 --> 14:10.014
If I can't get the father,
then I'll get the son.

14:18.416 --> 14:19.432
Oh. You again.

14:19.508 --> 14:21.142
No more jokes, Stark.

14:23.605 --> 14:25.864
Prepare to be removed
from history.

14:28.259 --> 14:30.776
[laughing]

14:30.853 --> 14:34.188
[grunts] Dad?

14:34.224 --> 14:37.858
Is that you?
Get away from my son!

14:37.936 --> 14:42.121
Your ridiculous, ancient Stark
suits won't save you now.

14:42.198 --> 14:44.215
[groans, growls]

14:44.292 --> 14:45.775
Steve, now!

14:45.777 --> 14:47.043
[grunts]

14:48.296 --> 14:50.704
[both grunt]

14:50.782 --> 14:52.965
I hope you don't mind
I borrowed a suit.

14:54.619 --> 14:56.469
[grunts, groans] Dad!

14:59.974 --> 15:03.735
[chuckles]
Children and their toys.

15:03.811 --> 15:05.686
Playtime is over... [yells]

15:08.391 --> 15:11.567
But the fun has just begun.

15:14.730 --> 15:16.989
Dad, wait up! Hold tight, kids!

15:22.330 --> 15:23.755
Whoa!

15:23.831 --> 15:26.582
You got this, Howard.
It's just like riding a bike.

15:34.159 --> 15:38.327
Come on out, Kang.
I know you're here.

15:38.329 --> 15:42.165
I'm not picking up any signals, which
means he's probably jamming them.

15:42.167 --> 15:44.000
We'll have to look for him the
old-fashioned way. Spread out.

15:44.002 --> 15:47.594
Sorry this isn't exactly the
ideal father-son bonding time.

15:47.672 --> 15:51.950
Getting to see you in action
with your Stark tech?

15:52.026 --> 15:54.177
And my old friend,
who's now your friend?

15:54.179 --> 15:56.028
It's perfect.

15:56.105 --> 15:58.514
Throwing punches,
taking down bad guys,

15:58.516 --> 16:00.107
and listening to a Stark ego.

16:00.185 --> 16:03.369
Probably not the reunion
either of us would have chosen.

16:03.446 --> 16:04.520
That's where you're wrong,
Rogers.

16:04.522 --> 16:06.872
I couldn't have planned it
any better.

16:13.456 --> 16:14.530
[grunts] Huh?

16:14.532 --> 16:16.382
[yells] [grunts]

16:16.459 --> 16:19.143
[grunts]

16:19.220 --> 16:22.647
I came here to wipe
the Starks from existence.

16:22.724 --> 16:26.209
Taking you, Captain America,
will be a bonus.

16:26.211 --> 16:28.486
Excuse me, Kang. That's my date.

16:28.563 --> 16:30.822
[grunts] I only found
out today he's alive.

16:30.898 --> 16:32.042
Rather prefer
to keep it that way.

16:32.066 --> 16:33.566
[yells]

16:33.642 --> 16:35.326
[all grunting]

16:37.222 --> 16:38.904
[groans]

16:38.981 --> 16:40.573
[grunting]

16:40.649 --> 16:43.075
Say, this thing's rather useful.

16:43.152 --> 16:44.577
Maybe I should get one
for myself.

16:44.653 --> 16:47.897
If you can handle it like that,
you deserve the original.

16:47.899 --> 16:49.340
Looks better on you.

16:51.085 --> 16:54.512
Hey, Kang. The Conqueror.

16:54.589 --> 16:56.347
How's that whole
bury-the-Starks plan going?

16:57.833 --> 16:59.759
[both] Ow.

16:59.835 --> 17:05.414
The only thing more annoying
than one Stark is two Starks!

17:05.415 --> 17:07.266
[groans]

17:07.343 --> 17:11.863
I think it's time to wave
the white flag, don't you?

17:11.939 --> 17:15.424
[sighs] You fail to see
the bigger picture.

17:15.425 --> 17:20.686
You and Howard Stark coming here from
the past created a time paradox.

17:20.765 --> 17:22.765
After you've been
displaced long enough,

17:22.767 --> 17:26.877
everything since the time
you left will disappear,

17:26.954 --> 17:31.607
including all future Starks.

17:31.609 --> 17:35.294
Kang is trying to destroy all of our
history. Everything we've ever done.

17:35.371 --> 17:38.614
I'm running an algorithm. See if
I can calculate how long we have

17:38.616 --> 17:40.132
before the time stream
is destroyed

17:40.209 --> 17:42.301
based on how fast
things are fading away.

17:42.378 --> 17:44.136
I can give you
the answer right now.

17:44.213 --> 17:46.731
It's too late.

17:46.808 --> 17:48.791
Enjoy watching your future,
your past,

17:48.793 --> 17:54.463
even your own son, disappear forever.
[grunts]

17:54.465 --> 17:56.741
Aah!

17:56.818 --> 17:59.077
No! I won't let it happen!

18:03.324 --> 18:06.492
Tony? Anything?
If these numbers are right,

18:06.569 --> 18:08.713
we need to get them back to their
own time by midnight tonight.

18:08.737 --> 18:10.479
Otherwise...

18:10.481 --> 18:11.756
Everything will be erased.

18:18.823 --> 18:20.840
Thank you!

18:20.916 --> 18:24.844
According to Tony's calculations, this
is where you came through the portal.

18:24.920 --> 18:28.088
[Iron Man] There should
be enough residual energy

18:28.166 --> 18:30.441
in the robot components
to build a time beacon.

18:30.518 --> 18:32.237
That'll reopen the portal
that brought you here.

18:32.261 --> 18:34.278
If we can finish it by midnight,
which is in,

18:34.355 --> 18:36.522
you know, less than two minutes.

18:36.599 --> 18:38.341
If we reconfigure
the core processor,

18:38.343 --> 18:40.860
we should be able to boost
the transmission range.

18:40.936 --> 18:42.736
I'll have to hold it
together manually.

18:46.534 --> 18:48.534
There's no reason
I can't go back with you.

18:48.611 --> 18:50.962
I'd like that.
Well, then, should I...

18:51.038 --> 18:52.521
But your home is here now,
in this century.

18:52.523 --> 18:56.450
You've become a modern
Avenger, and they need you.

18:56.527 --> 18:59.804
[Iron Man, Howard] We got it!

18:59.881 --> 19:02.306
Well, this has been
some kind of day.

19:02.383 --> 19:05.977
I found out I have a...
That I'll someday have a son.

19:06.053 --> 19:07.373
And he's a chip
off the old block.

19:11.542 --> 19:13.042
You won't remember any of this
when you get back.

19:13.044 --> 19:16.136
Who wants to know their future?

19:16.214 --> 19:18.397
I wanna be surprised
when it happens.

19:18.474 --> 19:20.992
I wish I'd be able to remember
this when I get back.

19:21.068 --> 19:26.647
But somehow, I think I'll know that the
rest of the 20th century will be okay.

19:26.724 --> 19:30.484
I guess I can't stay, but this can.
You take care of her.

19:30.561 --> 19:34.488
And I don't mean soup her up
with any of those gizmos.

19:34.565 --> 19:37.008
Some things are perfect
just the way they are.

19:37.084 --> 19:39.493
Peggy, I'm sorry
you still haven't gotten

19:39.570 --> 19:42.180
that dance I promised you
so long ago.

19:42.256 --> 19:44.423
Maybe some things
were never meant to be.

19:48.003 --> 19:49.261

[grunts]

19:54.252 --> 19:57.028
[grunts] Aah!

Is that...

19:59.090 --> 20:00.514
[Iron Man] Arno Stark?

20:00.591 --> 20:02.816
Curse you, Starks!

20:04.762 --> 20:05.986
No time left, Peg.

Weren't we just
arresting Dr. Faustus?

How did we get here?
I... I don't know.

20:40.314 --> 20:43.632
But happy New Year, Peg.

20:43.634 --> 20:46.244
I have a feeling the future
is gonna be good.

20:52.493 --> 20:54.919
[cheering continues]

20:54.996 --> 20:56.645
Wish there was some way to know,

20:56.647 --> 20:59.148
some proof that
they got back okay.

20:59.150 --> 21:01.000
Well, how's that for proof?

21:01.076 --> 21:03.410
Yeah. That'll do.

21:03.488 --> 21:04.965
A nice gift to remember
your father by.

21:04.989 --> 21:08.248
Yeah, but he gave me something better.
They both did.

21:08.326 --> 21:12.603
Time. Extra time with the people
you love is the best gift of all.

21:12.680 --> 21:15.164
