WEBVTT

00:06.367 --> 00:08.632
Uh-oh, she's
got that bounce.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.311
Do I need to call HR?

00:10.399 --> 00:13.707
No, I mean the bounce of a cop
who just put away a bad guy.

00:13.795 --> 00:15.709
After a hell of a long day
in court.

00:15.813 --> 00:17.639
Detectives?
Got a lady here

00:17.727 --> 00:19.233
saying she needs
to report a murder.

00:20.865 --> 00:22.694
All right. Thanks, Meyers.

00:26.709 --> 00:28.043
Detective Reagan,

00:28.130 --> 00:29.850
my partner Detective Baez.

00:29.938 --> 00:30.983
And you are?

00:31.071 --> 00:32.377
Uh, Roxy Smith.

00:32.561 --> 00:34.217
So who got murdered,
Ms. Smith?

00:34.440 --> 00:35.819
I don't know.

00:35.907 --> 00:37.256
I-I mean, they
haven't been yet,

00:37.344 --> 00:38.686
I don't think.

00:39.092 --> 00:40.530
Sorry, all this
has me creeped out.

00:40.618 --> 00:42.381
And us confused.

00:43.608 --> 00:46.717
I tend bar at a place
on Avenue B, The Clasp.

00:46.909 --> 00:48.616
Last night,
I overheard

00:48.704 --> 00:50.619
one of our regulars, Joe,

00:50.707 --> 00:52.827
saying he'd pay
to have someone killed.

00:53.027 --> 00:54.202
Like, serious money.

00:54.305 --> 00:55.678
I'm familiar
with The Clasp.

00:55.765 --> 00:58.817
It's half barflies, half
college students, all drunk.

00:58.905 --> 01:01.678
Including all of the bartenders.

01:02.147 --> 01:03.420
Okay.

01:03.756 --> 01:05.286
I had a couple shots.

01:05.373 --> 01:06.582
Mm. And if we know anything,

01:06.670 --> 01:08.735
it's that drunk people say
drunk things.

01:08.852 --> 01:10.490
But this Joe guy's
sick in the head.

01:10.592 --> 01:11.975
And a crap tipper.

01:12.264 --> 01:13.668
Not that that matters.

01:13.756 --> 01:15.629
Apparently, it does. Look,

01:15.717 --> 01:18.147
people who hurt other people
should be stopped.

01:19.569 --> 01:21.090
Sit tight.

01:23.506 --> 01:25.664
I don't know.
This whole thing seems thin.

01:25.759 --> 01:27.538
Yea...

01:27.842 --> 01:30.497
You know, the second collar
I ever had in my career

01:30.585 --> 01:32.848
was a guy
named Frank Blake.

01:33.350 --> 01:34.850
Did security
at The Clasp.

01:34.938 --> 01:36.358
He, uh, threw out
some kids.

01:36.446 --> 01:38.274
One of them mouthed off.

01:38.624 --> 01:39.768
He snapped.

01:39.855 --> 01:41.683
Jammed a pool cue
into the kid's eye.

01:41.770 --> 01:43.319
Killed him on the spot.

01:45.514 --> 01:47.306
So, what does
that mean?

01:47.774 --> 01:50.330
Means I'm gonna
have to, uh...

01:50.869 --> 01:52.689
make another appearance.

01:59.157 --> 02:00.333
You know,

02:00.421 --> 02:02.080
it's called "quitting time"
for a reason.

02:02.168 --> 02:04.299
Great. Thanks.
I'll see you tomorrow.

02:04.433 --> 02:06.681
Come on. Four nights in a row?

02:07.167 --> 02:09.142
Even the bad guys
sleep sometimes.

02:09.245 --> 02:12.190
And yet cases still don't
magically get themselves ready

02:12.278 --> 02:13.454
for court.

02:13.541 --> 02:15.135
Anything I
can help with?

02:16.021 --> 02:17.299
Yeah.

02:17.545 --> 02:20.199
Explain to me again
why we hired Alice Dornan

02:20.286 --> 02:21.752
as our psychiatric consultant.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.080
'Cause she's a
top-notch shrink.

02:23.168 --> 02:24.197
Who's now saying

02:24.285 --> 02:25.500
that Martina Volo,
the nanny

02:25.588 --> 02:27.197
that abused
that little girl,

02:27.293 --> 02:29.328
is not competent to stand trial.

02:29.416 --> 02:30.548
Well, maybe she's right.

02:30.726 --> 02:32.945
Or maybe she's the one
who's out of her mind.

02:33.033 --> 02:35.209
Why? Because you don't like
her diagnosis?

02:35.334 --> 02:37.989
Martina Volo
is competent and guilty...

02:38.077 --> 02:40.039
No ifs, ands or buts about it.

02:40.127 --> 02:43.101
Look, I'm the last guy
to defend an insanity plea,

02:43.189 --> 02:46.226
but Dornan's got scads
of forensic experience

02:46.314 --> 02:49.929
and knows a lot more about
this stuff than me or you.

02:50.017 --> 02:53.134
Fine. Then call her and tell her
to be here tomorrow

02:53.222 --> 02:54.789
at 10:00 a.m. sharp.

02:55.295 --> 02:56.796
Erin, it's late.
She's not in.

02:56.884 --> 02:58.101
Then leave a message.

02:58.189 --> 03:00.761
Because I want to hear
this expert opinion of hers

03:00.849 --> 03:02.203
in person.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:14.062 --> 03:15.703
Where-where are you going?

03:15.799 --> 03:16.859
Where you just said.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.359
You just missed the turn.

03:18.447 --> 03:19.843
Traffic that way sucks.

03:20.065 --> 03:22.285
Westbound lanes are
under construction.

03:22.740 --> 03:24.718
So you're Google Maps now?

03:26.523 --> 03:29.843
I do have some experience
with streets in this sector.

03:29.931 --> 03:32.265
And when you're my driver,
you go the way I tell you to.

03:32.360 --> 03:33.703
You got it?

03:34.906 --> 03:36.140
Course.

03:41.592 --> 03:43.804
So, what house were you in
before you came to the 2-9?

03:43.892 --> 03:46.323
Also when driving me...

03:47.585 --> 03:49.367
quiet is better.

04:00.137 --> 04:01.882
There he is.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.453
Mr. Mayor-Elect.

04:04.715 --> 04:06.586
Just "Peter," Commissioner.

04:07.095 --> 04:08.401
Then just "Frank."

04:08.637 --> 04:10.148
Please.

04:12.742 --> 04:15.382
Congratulations
on your election.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.423
Thank you.

04:17.851 --> 04:20.000
I got to say, none
of the mayors I served under

04:20.088 --> 04:21.757
got the kind of margin you got.

04:22.079 --> 04:25.203
Meaning, does he think
he has a mandate?

04:26.303 --> 04:28.085
Just a fact.

04:29.125 --> 04:31.390
I think we ran a smart campaign.

04:31.683 --> 04:34.272
But it'd be dumb to take
the credit for a tidal change.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.796
I just caught the wave.

04:36.491 --> 04:37.914
Here we are.

04:39.968 --> 04:41.718
And where is that?

04:43.803 --> 04:45.553
Word is you don't enter a room

04:45.641 --> 04:47.687
without knowing
why you've been invited.

04:49.523 --> 04:52.164
I heard rumors
you want me to stay on.

04:52.942 --> 04:54.289
I do.

04:54.726 --> 04:56.453
When I like
what somebody's doing,

04:56.541 --> 04:58.195
I want 'em to keep doing it.

04:58.897 --> 05:00.055
And when you don't?

05:00.143 --> 05:01.656
You and I
will talk.

05:01.817 --> 05:04.297
Not through channels,
not through the press.

05:06.390 --> 05:09.664
Bucking a City Hall tradition
that goes way back.

05:10.930 --> 05:13.531
I had sit-downs
with all the former mayors.

05:13.619 --> 05:16.056
Mayor Poole told me a story...

05:16.695 --> 05:18.859
You taking him on a ride-along, Mm.

05:19.258 --> 05:21.390
Pointing out guys
clearly packing weapons

05:21.478 --> 05:24.046
who you couldn't bust
on account of his policies.

05:25.048 --> 05:28.523
I think it brought him conflict
at the time.

05:28.746 --> 05:31.578
I walked away thinking
that's just plain wrong.

05:32.503 --> 05:36.188
I want the NYPD to reinstate
Stop, Question and Frisk.

05:37.897 --> 05:39.570
Hey, at least
you got the term right.

05:39.658 --> 05:41.529
That hardly ever happens.

05:42.219 --> 05:43.633
Homework.

05:44.875 --> 05:46.055
We...

05:46.201 --> 05:48.281
still employ a version of that.

05:48.369 --> 05:49.718
A watered-down one.

05:50.314 --> 05:52.398
Bring it back to 100 proof.

05:52.867 --> 05:55.789
There's also a law on the books
that's been dry-docked,

05:55.958 --> 05:57.351
332.10.

05:57.439 --> 05:58.477
Vagrancy enforcement.

05:58.568 --> 06:01.484
Tourism's a $44 billion
business in this city.

06:02.055 --> 06:07.234
But not if Tex, Sven and Hideki
are afraid to leave the hotel.

06:07.820 --> 06:09.932
And put the homeless where?

06:10.211 --> 06:12.898
I'll redirect funding
to more shelters.

06:13.544 --> 06:15.961
You hit the ground running.

06:16.295 --> 06:18.516
There's
a lot of ground to cover.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.742
So,

06:25.339 --> 06:26.803
what's the ask?

06:27.092 --> 06:30.016
Word is you never enter a room
without one.

06:32.716 --> 06:35.227
I want you to make
a personnel change.

06:35.609 --> 06:37.163
I have a couple
of recommendations

06:37.251 --> 06:39.265
for your new DCPI.

06:43.710 --> 06:47.062
Garrett Moore
is supremely fit for the job.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.280
He's smart, quick on his feet,

06:49.386 --> 06:52.562
well-liked by the press
and all the city agencies.

06:52.650 --> 06:54.826
And that is a bad thing how?

06:55.477 --> 06:57.218
He needs to be liked.

06:57.497 --> 06:59.210
He basks in being liked.

06:59.298 --> 07:00.710
He's a Labrador retriever,

07:00.798 --> 07:02.539
and you're gonna need
a pit bull.

07:03.249 --> 07:05.241
I want to take
this city back,

07:05.633 --> 07:07.548
and your guys are my Marines.

07:07.636 --> 07:10.952
There's gonna be pushback
that Garrett's gonna cave under.

07:11.041 --> 07:12.062
And you know I'm right,

07:12.150 --> 07:13.819
as sure as you're sitting here.

07:35.775 --> 07:37.509
<font color=#FF00FF>*BLUE BLOODS*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 10  Episode 09</font>

07:37.596 --> 07:39.103
<font color=#FF00FF>*BLUE BLOODS*</font>
Episode Title :<font color=#FFc30f>"Grave Errorse"</font>

07:43.194 --> 07:44.284
Really? The whole tour?

07:44.371 --> 07:45.858
Oh, every turn I made,

07:45.946 --> 07:46.927
where I suggested

07:47.015 --> 07:48.357
we take our meal.

07:48.663 --> 07:51.222
Even the way I radioed Central,
she criticized.

07:51.570 --> 07:53.287
I thought she'd
warm up to you.

07:53.375 --> 07:55.952
Mm. Apparently,
she only has two settings,

07:56.085 --> 07:57.981
cold and colder.

07:58.069 --> 08:00.778
- Want me to talk to her?
- That is exactly what I do not want.

08:00.866 --> 08:03.195
- I can be very charming.
- And I am a big girl,

08:03.283 --> 08:04.937
and I can fight my own battles.

08:05.294 --> 08:06.730
I shouldn't have even told you.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.100
Why? Why not?
That's what husbands are for.

08:09.188 --> 08:11.203
When you're on the clock,
you're just another sergeant.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.610
Okay. Well, I'm a sergeant
who doesn't like other sergeants

08:13.698 --> 08:15.765
running roughshod
all over his people.

08:16.124 --> 08:18.482
Especially the hottest
patrol officer in the...

08:18.570 --> 08:20.363
history of hot patrol officers.

08:20.605 --> 08:22.599
Even after an eight-hour tour

08:22.687 --> 08:26.058
in a stinky car
with a person that hates me?

08:26.374 --> 08:28.539
Oh, I meant Jenkins.
He's very clean.

08:29.734 --> 08:32.063
Oh. Go back to work.

08:32.390 --> 08:34.835
Hey, listen, get some sleep.
Don't worry about McNichols.

08:34.923 --> 08:36.649
The more she gets to know
the real Eddie Janko,

08:36.736 --> 08:38.928
the more she'll fall in love
with her like the rest of us.

08:39.015 --> 08:40.171
Mm.

08:40.414 --> 08:42.773
- Love you.
- Be safe.

08:46.630 --> 08:48.154
Have a seat, Dr. Dornan.

08:48.242 --> 08:49.330
Thank you.

08:49.603 --> 08:50.640
So, you claim

08:50.728 --> 08:52.614
that Martina Volo was crazy

08:52.702 --> 08:55.610
when she smacked around
the little girl in her care.

08:56.023 --> 08:57.898
"Crazy" isn't a word I use.

08:58.033 --> 08:59.513
Are you aware
that even

08:59.601 --> 09:01.030
the defense's shrink
is not arguing

09:01.118 --> 09:02.960
that she was
mentally incompetent?

09:03.241 --> 09:05.085
Their opinion
doesn't change mine.

09:05.173 --> 09:07.677
But it's your opinion
that this office should just...

09:07.765 --> 09:09.145
give up?

09:10.898 --> 09:12.835
My job is to evaluate
the defendant,

09:12.923 --> 09:14.534
not make legal recommendations.

09:14.629 --> 09:15.760
Well, thank God for that.

09:15.847 --> 09:16.848
What Ms. Reagan
means is...

09:16.935 --> 09:18.981
No, I can speak
for myself, Anthony.

09:20.421 --> 09:23.491
The facts of this case
are very clear, Doctor.

09:23.585 --> 09:25.727
She beat up
a six-year-old little girl

09:25.814 --> 09:27.511
and then walked
to the nearest police station

09:27.598 --> 09:29.304
and gave a complete confession.

09:29.443 --> 09:31.426
When I interviewed her,
she exhibited signs

09:31.514 --> 09:33.342
of disorganized speech
and delusions

09:33.430 --> 09:35.304
of reference
consistent with schizophrenia.

09:35.392 --> 09:36.968
And now you just want
to set her free.

09:37.056 --> 09:39.028
Being remanded
to a psychiatric institution

09:39.116 --> 09:40.872
is hardly being set free.

09:42.062 --> 09:44.353
Do you have children,
Dr. Dornan?

09:45.037 --> 09:47.007
- Am I on trial here?
- Erin...

09:47.110 --> 09:49.481
No, you're not on trial,
nor will this office

09:49.577 --> 09:51.492
be needing your help
in the future.

09:51.935 --> 09:53.013
Ms. Reagan,

09:53.101 --> 09:54.966
I've made similar evaluations
before,

09:55.084 --> 09:57.005
and you've never...
have a nice day. Thank you.

10:06.660 --> 10:08.341
Erin, I-I'm sorry,

10:08.429 --> 10:11.171
but what the...
Thank you for bringing her down.

10:30.086 --> 10:31.131
Tough day?

10:32.794 --> 10:34.661
What makes you
say that?

10:35.895 --> 10:38.950
Decades of experience
reading my son.

10:39.038 --> 10:41.302
Well, I met
with the new mayor today.

10:41.543 --> 10:42.802
He want to replace you?

10:42.890 --> 10:45.240
Go figure.
He wants me to stay on.

10:46.651 --> 10:49.306
But he wants me
to replace my right hand.

10:50.277 --> 10:51.817
What's he got against Garrett?

10:51.905 --> 10:54.560
Doesn't think he's tough enough
to handle the flak.

10:54.989 --> 10:56.817
Then let him hire
his own flak guy.

10:56.905 --> 11:00.559
Well, his plan,
if and when carried out,

11:00.647 --> 11:02.864
is gonna bring a lot
of heat to us.

11:02.952 --> 11:05.738
And it ain't gonna be
just a bunch of deputy mayors

11:05.826 --> 11:08.403
rousting the homeless
or frisking the shifty.

11:08.684 --> 11:10.178
It's gonna be us.

11:10.606 --> 11:13.349
Garrett can be as
slippery as they come.

11:13.903 --> 11:15.371
Did you tell Chase that?

11:15.459 --> 11:17.548
Not in so many words,
but yeah.

11:20.421 --> 11:21.981
There's a question

11:22.747 --> 11:24.403
behind the question here.

11:24.491 --> 11:25.620
What do you mean?

11:25.708 --> 11:27.106
Think. Think.

11:27.739 --> 11:29.372
Okay.

11:30.085 --> 11:33.583
I thinkhe sees me as useful.

11:33.762 --> 11:35.329
That's usually a good sign.

11:35.417 --> 11:37.270
But, uh, wait.

11:37.358 --> 11:40.435
He wants to reinstate
some policies and laws

11:40.547 --> 11:43.200
that are gonna be very unpopular
with some people.

11:43.389 --> 11:47.099
He might find it useful
just to point to me and say,

11:47.259 --> 11:49.153
"If you don't like it,
talk to him."

11:49.241 --> 11:52.333
And are they policies and
laws that you want to enforce?

11:52.421 --> 11:55.816
Within reason,
and for the right reasons.

11:56.052 --> 11:58.903
Oh. That's slippery.

12:00.283 --> 12:02.809
Maybe you should
be your own DCPI.

12:03.684 --> 12:05.427
Well, what I mean is,

12:05.515 --> 12:08.410
as long as it doesn't
adversely affect our citizens

12:08.498 --> 12:10.411
in service to our tourists.

12:10.631 --> 12:13.755
Is that's what's driving him?
All that "I Love New York" crap?

12:13.843 --> 12:16.153
Some. I don't know how much.

12:16.413 --> 12:17.692
What do you want to do?

12:17.780 --> 12:20.653
I do not mind being useful.

12:22.149 --> 12:26.356
But not just in service
to someone else's ends.

12:27.739 --> 12:29.132
Huh.

12:37.963 --> 12:39.922
One more over here.

12:41.520 --> 12:42.662
Thank you, Roxy.

12:42.750 --> 12:44.786
And, uh, one more
for my friend here.

12:45.119 --> 12:46.911
What are you drinking
there, buddy?

12:47.710 --> 12:48.842
Whiskey.

12:49.013 --> 12:51.044
You know, make mine
a whiskey, too.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.488
Place is jumping
as usual, huh?

12:54.958 --> 12:56.372
As usual?

12:56.544 --> 12:58.630
Never seen you before.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.812
Come in all the time
when I'm not in the can.

13:01.966 --> 13:03.380
Buddy Mullane.

13:03.684 --> 13:05.388
Joe.
Joe what?

13:05.476 --> 13:07.099
Joe None-Of-Your-Business.

13:07.341 --> 13:09.907
Think your brother-in-law
was in my unit...

13:09.994 --> 13:12.122
Larry Get-Outta-My-Face.

13:15.906 --> 13:17.645
Unit, huh? Yup.

13:18.221 --> 13:20.527
You military? Former Marine.

13:20.615 --> 13:22.716
Till the bastards
threw me in the brig.

13:23.834 --> 13:26.893
Some knucklehead forgot
that he owed me a few bucks,

13:26.981 --> 13:29.535
so I bounced his head
off a curb a few times.

13:29.623 --> 13:31.583
The world is full
of double-crossers.

13:31.671 --> 13:32.981
Yup.

13:33.100 --> 13:35.102
There's nothing
like sweet payback.

13:37.449 --> 13:39.386
- Thank you.
- Joe Kiernan.

13:41.708 --> 13:42.972
You ever do time, Joe?

13:43.060 --> 13:44.300
I'm smarter than that.

13:44.388 --> 13:47.364
- Hmm.
- So you're saying I'm dumb?

13:48.816 --> 13:50.472
I just mean,

13:50.560 --> 13:53.697
when I got a score
to settle, I farm it out.

13:53.823 --> 13:57.433
Well, when I have a score to settle,
I handle it myself.

14:05.922 --> 14:08.075
How you doing on cash, Buddy?

14:08.224 --> 14:10.833
Oh, everybody needs cash.

14:11.668 --> 14:13.409
Well, maybe I got a job for you.

14:13.496 --> 14:14.833
What's the job?

14:14.934 --> 14:16.661
A job.

14:17.890 --> 14:20.942
Oh. Someone crossed you?

14:21.286 --> 14:22.614
Like you don't even know.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.145
Here's your next play.

14:25.843 --> 14:28.224
Get off of her!

14:29.177 --> 14:30.956
Oh, here we go.

14:31.044 --> 14:32.466
Look at that.

14:32.716 --> 14:34.299
Hey, where you going, Joe?

14:34.427 --> 14:35.953
Maybe some other time.

14:36.040 --> 14:39.130
Thought you needed my help.281
East Snyder in Flatbush.

14:39.247 --> 14:40.981
Come by tomorrow, we'll talk.

14:41.147 --> 14:43.059
<i>Break it up! Break it up!</i>

14:47.591 --> 14:48.675
Did he tell you?

14:48.763 --> 14:51.895
Not yet,
but I got my hooks in him.

15:11.708 --> 15:13.922
If you're going to be lurking
in my office,

15:14.010 --> 15:16.055
the least you can do
is let me know.

15:19.026 --> 15:22.203
Saves me the trouble of looking
all over the floor for you.

15:24.045 --> 15:25.151
You know, I get it.

15:25.264 --> 15:27.719
There's something calming
about the view from here.

15:31.905 --> 15:34.295
What are you calming yourself
about?

15:36.959 --> 15:38.764
Change, I guess.

15:40.637 --> 15:42.678
Change is supposed
to be constant.

15:43.733 --> 15:45.240
But not around here.

15:48.101 --> 15:49.748
Until today?

15:54.354 --> 15:58.108
I have an offer that
I don't think I can pass up.

16:02.248 --> 16:03.990
Oh.

16:06.105 --> 16:07.881
So this isn't a conversation?

16:07.969 --> 16:09.144
It's news...

16:09.252 --> 16:11.881
that I wanted
to share first with you.

16:13.647 --> 16:15.158
Must be a hell of an offer.

16:15.245 --> 16:16.559
Head of Institutional

16:16.647 --> 16:18.545
Development for Duke University.

16:19.357 --> 16:21.504
Travel to Europe, Asia,

16:21.592 --> 16:22.701
preach the gospel

16:22.789 --> 16:26.532
that the athletics powerhouse is
also an academic one.

16:27.006 --> 16:28.608
Wow.

16:31.474 --> 16:33.694
They've come at you before, no?

16:34.350 --> 16:36.826
Colleges have, but not Duke.

16:37.303 --> 16:39.617
And not like this.

16:40.358 --> 16:41.576
Well...

16:42.584 --> 16:44.342
Congratulations.

16:44.467 --> 16:45.536
Thank you.

16:46.115 --> 16:47.538
Tell me something.

16:47.625 --> 16:50.459
Does the timing strike you
as, oh...

16:50.707 --> 16:52.209
anything?

16:53.349 --> 16:54.959
How so?

16:56.199 --> 16:59.717
Well, we got a new mayor coming in,
résumés going out.

16:59.805 --> 17:02.000
Let's be clear. This came to me.
I wasn't looking.

17:02.088 --> 17:05.917
Okay, okay.
I'm just... thinking out loud.

17:06.295 --> 17:09.255
I don't think colleges track
our City Hall transitions.

17:09.342 --> 17:10.826
The timing's just...

17:11.217 --> 17:13.001
is what it is.

17:16.388 --> 17:18.645
I will be very sorry
to see you go.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.178
That goes without saying.

17:20.328 --> 17:22.287
But I appreciate
you saying it.

17:23.992 --> 17:25.864
And I'll help
with my replacement, of course.

17:26.872 --> 17:28.209
I'll need it.

17:28.620 --> 17:32.154
We can talk timelines...
another time.

17:40.295 --> 17:41.940
So...

17:42.372 --> 17:44.068
on with our day?

17:49.584 --> 17:51.167
Yes.

18:10.142 --> 18:13.070
Hey, Joe! You ready
to rock and roll or what?

18:13.158 --> 18:15.412
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Not here, not here.

18:20.064 --> 18:21.654
You know
what I don't need from you?

18:21.742 --> 18:24.342
- Bunch of smart-ass comments.
- Hey, hey, relax.

18:24.570 --> 18:26.137
Well, the job...
Who is it?

18:26.526 --> 18:27.779
Roxy.

18:28.005 --> 18:28.990
At The Clasp?

18:29.078 --> 18:31.137
Me and her used to be together.
I noticed you didn't

18:31.225 --> 18:32.429
say two words to her last night.

18:32.516 --> 18:34.475
'Cause she broke up with me
for no reason.

18:34.791 --> 18:36.141
Now I got to watch her flirt

18:36.229 --> 18:37.970
with every jerk
who walks through the bar.

18:38.638 --> 18:39.895
How much?

18:40.005 --> 18:41.271
Ten large.

18:41.701 --> 18:43.132
I'll take half up front.

18:43.438 --> 18:44.613
That's doable.

18:44.709 --> 18:45.959
I got a guy
in Jersey doing

18:46.047 --> 18:48.373
a chemical cleanup
on an EPA site.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.359
I'll bat her over the head,
throw her in a vat.

18:50.446 --> 18:51.740
No.

18:51.912 --> 18:54.002
You want the money,
you do it my way.

18:54.747 --> 18:55.747
I got a piece of land

18:55.838 --> 18:57.834
in Washingtonville
I'm gonna build a place on.

18:57.922 --> 19:00.412
Take her up there,
put one between her eyes,

19:00.532 --> 19:02.701
dig a grave and cover her up.

19:02.803 --> 19:04.186
You want me to dig a grave?

19:04.274 --> 19:06.389
Yeah. A deep one.

19:07.615 --> 19:09.451
Okay. I'll need a few days.

19:09.539 --> 19:11.194
Thought you said
you came to rock and roll.

19:11.281 --> 19:13.022
You ever dig a grave?

19:13.110 --> 19:14.677
Well, hurry it up,

19:15.159 --> 19:18.397
'cause every day I got to see
this bitch is one day too many.

19:28.307 --> 19:30.831
Hey, I just sent you
the contract for the new shrink.

19:30.918 --> 19:33.358
Can you arrange for him to meet
with Martina Volo immediately?

19:33.662 --> 19:35.358
So Dornan's really out?

19:35.445 --> 19:37.055
Yeah. You thought I was joking?

19:37.142 --> 19:38.230
Erin, sit.

19:38.318 --> 19:39.320
What?

19:39.408 --> 19:40.450
You heard me.

19:40.537 --> 19:42.889
Why? Just humor me.

19:42.977 --> 19:44.762
Please.

19:45.977 --> 19:47.805
I think I know what's going on.

19:47.892 --> 19:49.691
Is there something going on?

19:49.779 --> 19:51.725
Yeah. With you.
The-the long hours,

19:51.834 --> 19:54.186
the marching
around pissed at the world.

19:54.274 --> 19:56.189
- I'm fine.
- I'm just saying.

19:56.277 --> 19:58.561
It-It's okay
to feel a little lost.

19:59.584 --> 20:01.948
- About what?
- Erin,

20:02.310 --> 20:05.053
the only thing
you ever wanted was to be D.A.

20:05.255 --> 20:06.902
Then, when you finally
get the chance,

20:06.990 --> 20:08.210
you decide
it's not what you wanted.

20:08.297 --> 20:09.819
- No, I just put a pin in that...
- And this

20:09.906 --> 20:11.983
never-ending
whatever-it-is with Jack.

20:12.071 --> 20:13.193
And Nicky

20:13.281 --> 20:14.490
moving across the country,

20:14.578 --> 20:16.970
so no more morning coffee
with your best friend

20:17.058 --> 20:18.176
and no more dinners

20:18.264 --> 20:19.725
to make when
she gets home.

20:19.813 --> 20:21.467
I have no idea
what you're saying.

20:21.839 --> 20:23.389
I'm saying, I get it.

20:24.006 --> 20:26.326
A little midlife crisis happens
to all of us.

20:26.414 --> 20:28.068
Oh. Okay, all right.

20:28.156 --> 20:30.287
Why don't we just hire you
as the shrink?

20:31.022 --> 20:33.372
You know, the-the floor
dropped out for me

20:33.669 --> 20:36.387
when I left the NYPD,
my marriage went kaput.

20:36.475 --> 20:40.118
Hell, I-I'm still heartbroken
over not seeing Sophia

20:40.205 --> 20:43.034
every day, and she
just lives in Jersey.

20:43.451 --> 20:45.092
Okay. Can we get back
to work, please?

20:45.180 --> 20:48.381
And thank you for this,
whatever this was.

21:00.202 --> 21:02.639
- All right.
- All right, be safe, okay?

21:03.279 --> 21:05.014
Refueling.

21:05.230 --> 21:06.522
Just in time.

21:06.678 --> 21:08.662
Keep that straight, will ya?

21:08.750 --> 21:10.365
Oh, yeah, my hair is...

21:10.535 --> 21:12.319
It's a little puffy tonight.

21:13.782 --> 21:15.460
Geez, how many sugars
did you put in there?

21:15.547 --> 21:17.006
Okay.

21:20.201 --> 21:21.768
You have a problem with me?

21:22.067 --> 21:23.295
- Problem?
- Yeah.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.559
You've hated my guts
ever since I came on midnights.

21:25.683 --> 21:28.600
And now, you make me
your driver.

21:28.697 --> 21:29.916
You're imagining things.

21:30.004 --> 21:32.006
No, I'm seeing what's right
in front of me.

21:32.178 --> 21:33.311
You think I'm a zero?

21:33.399 --> 21:35.543
Is that it?
Am... am I a bad cop?

21:35.631 --> 21:37.233
No, you're pretty solid.

21:37.717 --> 21:39.295
You do talk too much.

21:39.481 --> 21:40.756
I can never figure out

21:40.844 --> 21:41.929
where the heck
you're driving me,

21:42.016 --> 21:44.018
but I'm not gonna ding you
for your last name.

21:44.551 --> 21:46.022
Janko?

21:46.234 --> 21:47.842
I mean your
married name.

21:48.740 --> 21:49.796
Reagan.

21:50.365 --> 21:51.592
That's all I'm gonna say.

21:51.687 --> 21:52.713
No, w-wait.

21:52.801 --> 21:54.238
What does that mean?

21:56.412 --> 21:57.748
Jamie do something to you?

21:57.836 --> 21:59.664
- Not your husband.
- Who?

22:01.529 --> 22:02.615
My father-in-law?

22:02.703 --> 22:04.076
Yeah, try "fraud."

22:04.164 --> 22:05.483
And a hypocrite.

22:05.669 --> 22:07.178
You can't be serious.

22:07.266 --> 22:09.975
Frank Reagan
sits up there at One PP,

22:10.164 --> 22:12.318
spouting about how all of us
should be so happy

22:12.406 --> 22:14.076
to be part of the NYPD family.

22:14.164 --> 22:17.529
He could give a rat's ass
about any family but his own.

22:18.201 --> 22:19.652
Especially not mine.

22:20.781 --> 22:21.869
So...

22:21.957 --> 22:23.698
drop the charm offensive

22:23.917 --> 22:25.310
and let's go.

22:32.225 --> 22:33.615
Joe said I was his girlfriend?

22:33.703 --> 22:36.489
Or ex... enough to want
you dead either way.

22:36.577 --> 22:38.287
We went out
maybe twice.

22:38.381 --> 22:39.733
First time wasn't even a date.

22:39.821 --> 22:41.649
We just kept drinking
after closing time.

22:41.979 --> 22:43.522
And went home
together.

22:43.610 --> 22:45.061
And it was fun.

22:45.149 --> 22:47.170
Viagra's a hell of a drug.

22:47.692 --> 22:49.569
Then, I found out
he lives with a girl

22:49.656 --> 22:51.381
and I told him to go to hell,
and still,

22:51.469 --> 22:52.990
he comes in and
stink-eyes me

22:53.078 --> 22:55.147
whenever I so much
as talk to another guy.

22:55.299 --> 22:56.990
It's like you said,
sick in the head.

22:57.078 --> 22:58.826
Yeah, so now
you arrest him, right?

22:59.548 --> 23:01.990
Not till we have more.Right.

23:02.162 --> 23:03.553
You guys said you recorded him.

23:03.779 --> 23:04.920
But a judge
could still

23:05.008 --> 23:07.488
toss it saying it's just words.

23:07.681 --> 23:08.866
But we still have to
go through with it.

23:08.953 --> 23:10.168
Not all the way.

23:10.256 --> 23:11.475
We fake your death,

23:11.563 --> 23:12.983
take a picture, show him,

23:13.071 --> 23:15.682
convince him it's real,
get the payment.

23:16.552 --> 23:17.639
Is he serious?

23:17.727 --> 23:19.123
And right.

23:26.478 --> 23:27.604
What are we eating, exactly?

23:27.691 --> 23:29.371
Oh, it's meant
to be chicken parm.

23:29.459 --> 23:31.609
You've had chicken parm
a million times.

23:31.803 --> 23:34.634
I don't recall it
being so resilient.

23:34.940 --> 23:36.812
It's very good.

23:36.908 --> 23:38.692
My compliments
to the chef.

23:38.810 --> 23:40.594
Thank you. You made this?

23:40.682 --> 23:42.001
First Sunday dinner
all by myself.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.334
It's delicious, Sean.

23:43.421 --> 23:44.466
Yeah.
You might've got the piece

23:44.553 --> 23:45.467
that was meant for me...

23:45.554 --> 23:46.712
He's a little
upset 'cause

23:46.800 --> 23:49.243
we're having a disagreement
about upping his allowance.

23:49.399 --> 23:51.436
Call it cost of
living adjustments.

23:51.524 --> 23:54.290
Try bankrolling
a kid in San Francisco.

23:54.462 --> 23:56.313
Well, I think he should get
whatever he wants.

23:56.434 --> 23:59.124
Uh-huh, you two wait till
you start popping them out.

23:59.212 --> 24:00.717
See how tight
your wallet gets then.

24:00.805 --> 24:01.872
Exactly.

24:01.960 --> 24:03.430
What about you, Francis?

24:04.712 --> 24:06.413
Always live within your means.

24:06.501 --> 24:09.069
And you can live in your car,
but you can't drive your house,

24:09.157 --> 24:10.466
so budget accordingly.

24:10.554 --> 24:13.437
No, no. I meant
your review of dinner.

24:13.602 --> 24:15.141
Five stars, Sean.

24:16.428 --> 24:18.082
But you've hardly had a bite.

24:19.242 --> 24:21.988
Take it back.
Six stars, okay?

24:22.099 --> 24:23.445
Well...

24:26.507 --> 24:27.732
You okay?

24:27.859 --> 24:29.435
Oh...

24:29.523 --> 24:31.437
you know, the usual.

24:31.525 --> 24:34.289
Any developments
in the usual front?

24:35.460 --> 24:38.601
Download you later, Pop,
okay?

24:39.187 --> 24:40.528
Okay.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.709
Is there
a family code

24:42.797 --> 24:44.242
I'm missing?

24:44.851 --> 24:46.625
I figure it out,
I'll let you know.

24:47.958 --> 24:49.176
Okay.

24:49.465 --> 24:50.983
Okay...

24:52.132 --> 24:55.367
There may be some personnel
changes in my office.

24:55.773 --> 24:57.240
But it's confidential...

24:57.570 --> 24:58.633
until it isn't.

24:58.721 --> 25:00.690
Oh, well, that really
clears things up.

25:00.778 --> 25:02.007
And...

25:03.335 --> 25:05.959
..I think I'm realizing
something about myself.

25:06.047 --> 25:07.256
I hate change.

25:07.344 --> 25:09.513
You...
want the things

25:09.600 --> 25:11.959
that you like to stay
the way that they are?

25:12.047 --> 25:13.834
Yeah, but worse.

25:13.922 --> 25:17.099
I am willing to give up
trying to change the things

25:17.187 --> 25:19.697
I don't like in order
to keep the ones I do.

25:19.898 --> 25:22.342
I've seen you change like
the seasons my whole life.

25:22.430 --> 25:25.084
Well, I thought it would
make me a better person.

25:25.172 --> 25:27.705
But I'm kind of done with that,
truth be told.

25:27.792 --> 25:29.367
Being a better person?

25:29.764 --> 25:32.519
Uh, maybe this is
as good as it gets.

25:32.911 --> 25:34.391
You could do worse.

25:35.890 --> 25:37.365
A compliment.

25:37.469 --> 25:39.914
There's a saying
I always hang onto.

25:41.250 --> 25:44.069
"Everything comes to pass,
nothing comes to stay."

25:44.234 --> 25:45.375
Yeah, I heard that one.

25:45.462 --> 25:46.681
Who said that?

25:46.768 --> 25:48.770
I'm not sure...
Some wise old soul.

25:48.961 --> 25:50.607
Yeah, I looked it up.

25:50.695 --> 25:53.217
It's from one of those
'70s self-help books

25:53.305 --> 25:55.867
by a guy never heard from
before or since.

25:56.567 --> 25:59.062
But, hey, if it works for you.

25:59.172 --> 26:00.346
Oh.

26:00.641 --> 26:02.406
You're really fun today,
Dad.

26:02.494 --> 26:04.310
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I pulled a rib out

26:04.398 --> 26:06.265
from laughing so hard.

26:08.961 --> 26:10.164
Okay?

26:10.252 --> 26:12.326
Okay, thank you very much.

26:12.414 --> 26:13.672
Thank you.

26:13.953 --> 26:15.482
Listen, I get it.

26:15.570 --> 26:17.514
Like, it-it really sucks
when somebody leaves,

26:17.602 --> 26:18.796
especially somebody
that you, like,

26:18.883 --> 26:21.278
actually like,
or-or used to.

26:21.366 --> 26:22.844
Thank you.

26:23.694 --> 26:24.904
Where's this
coming from?

26:24.992 --> 26:27.195
Well, if I get more allowance...
Hear me out...

26:27.430 --> 26:29.462
I could go visit
Jack at college.

26:29.549 --> 26:32.099
I save up a little bit more,
I can go visit Nicky.

26:32.187 --> 26:34.076
Mm-hmm.
That's very sweet.

26:34.163 --> 26:35.467
Watch it, he's getting better.

26:35.555 --> 26:36.382
I ain't buying it.

26:36.469 --> 26:38.053
- It's the truth.
- Pass the salad.

26:38.141 --> 26:39.240
Nice try.

26:39.328 --> 26:40.803
It was worth a try.

26:49.831 --> 26:51.006
Come in.

26:52.181 --> 26:54.164
Patrick, you're early...

26:57.227 --> 26:59.109
Firing me once wasn't enough?

26:59.250 --> 27:00.719
Look, just hear me out.

27:00.807 --> 27:03.365
The Brooklyn D.A. already called
to say I won't be consulting

27:03.453 --> 27:05.185
for them anymore, either...
Thanks for that.

27:05.273 --> 27:06.325
That wasn't me, Doc.

27:06.412 --> 27:08.812
And sometimes the other
offices hear things...

27:08.937 --> 27:10.808
And now I'm paying the price.

27:11.461 --> 27:13.547
Look, I'm here because...

27:13.855 --> 27:15.726
I was way out of line
the other day.

27:15.813 --> 27:16.852
Yes, you were.

27:16.940 --> 27:19.357
It's just that a case
involving a nanny

27:19.445 --> 27:21.435
who hurt a little child,
just feels like

27:21.523 --> 27:22.867
it should be a slam dunk.

27:22.955 --> 27:25.477
Unless the facts
dictate otherwise.

27:25.649 --> 27:27.477
Doc, you render opinions.

27:27.564 --> 27:30.915
Based on medical
and psychiatric facts.

27:32.106 --> 27:35.641
The same mix of art and science
you practice in your profession.

27:36.946 --> 27:38.648
Fair enough.

27:41.413 --> 27:43.734
So, you stand by
what you said?

27:45.820 --> 27:47.758
I'll admit I didn't at first.

27:48.219 --> 27:49.673
Really?

27:49.867 --> 27:52.289
Ever since I was
brutally mugged last year,

27:52.377 --> 27:56.094
I've wanted revenge
on every violent person I see.

27:58.797 --> 28:00.734
Part of me agrees
with you completely.

28:01.690 --> 28:05.469
Wants to see Martina Volo
thrown down a deep, dark hole.

28:09.156 --> 28:10.523
But once I realized

28:10.611 --> 28:12.570
where that was coming from...

28:12.984 --> 28:16.203
You ignored that part
and did your job.

28:20.737 --> 28:22.336
Right.

28:33.234 --> 28:34.586
This is a one-off.

28:34.849 --> 28:36.006
Understood.

28:36.094 --> 28:37.631
I am making this exception

28:37.719 --> 28:39.264
because I think
I can shed some light

28:39.352 --> 28:40.750
where it's needed.

28:40.838 --> 28:41.839
I appreciate it.

28:42.030 --> 28:43.373
Long story short,

28:43.461 --> 28:44.842
Sergeant McNichols likely thinks

28:44.930 --> 28:47.391
that the commissioner
ruined her marriage.

28:48.344 --> 28:49.428
How?

28:49.515 --> 28:52.068
Two years ago,
McNichols' ex-husband

28:52.156 --> 28:54.641
was accused by a partner
of taking free meals

28:54.735 --> 28:56.633
and kickback money
from a store

28:56.734 --> 28:57.834
in their sector.

28:57.922 --> 28:59.221
And abusive behavior

28:59.308 --> 29:01.919
towards citizens
and fellow cops alike.

29:02.319 --> 29:03.738
Husband's a jerk, too?

29:03.834 --> 29:05.076
- Shocker.
- Except

29:05.164 --> 29:06.664
when IAB
interviewed the partner,

29:06.752 --> 29:08.094
he suddenly recanted everything.

29:08.182 --> 29:09.879
Said it was
"a big misunderstanding."

29:10.014 --> 29:11.344
Ah, he got to him.

29:11.434 --> 29:13.567
Probably, so the commissioner
didn't let it go.

29:13.655 --> 29:14.709
Well, why not?

29:14.797 --> 29:16.484
Because he hates bullies.

29:16.572 --> 29:18.587
So, he was able
to discipline him on a couple

29:18.675 --> 29:21.648
smaller offenses...
Stealing time, leaving early.

29:21.736 --> 29:22.748
Good.

29:22.836 --> 29:24.301
But those habits
didn't go away.

29:24.516 --> 29:26.130
They eventually cost him the job

29:26.218 --> 29:27.945
and, I guess, his marriage.

29:28.250 --> 29:29.834
She blames the commissioner?

29:29.922 --> 29:31.514
Apparently.

29:32.062 --> 29:33.895
Nice not having
this conversation with you,

29:33.983 --> 29:35.637
Officer.

29:46.783 --> 29:49.820
Okay, um, timeline was...

29:50.062 --> 29:51.490
I was gonna look for you.

29:51.656 --> 29:53.224
And then Baker said
you were already

29:53.312 --> 29:56.508
in my office and then
you had your own news.

29:57.070 --> 29:58.805
Look for me... why?

30:01.062 --> 30:02.920
In my meeting
with the mayor-elect,

30:03.008 --> 30:05.898
he asked me to replace you
with a pit bull.

30:09.484 --> 30:11.883
And you said yes?

30:12.758 --> 30:14.339
No.

30:15.070 --> 30:16.428
No...

30:16.937 --> 30:18.865
but I didn't say no.

30:21.570 --> 30:22.957
Why a pit bull?

30:23.687 --> 30:26.154
He wants to equip us to deal
with things the hard way

30:26.242 --> 30:28.326
when the easy way doesn't work.

30:28.421 --> 30:31.780
A latitude I've wanted for years,
I might add.

30:33.311 --> 30:36.086
But for the rollout, you want
a wartime consigliere.

30:37.203 --> 30:38.836
Well, he thinks so.

30:39.062 --> 30:40.312
Me?

30:40.867 --> 30:42.484
I don't think so.

30:42.789 --> 30:43.883
You?

30:44.766 --> 30:46.078
Me?

30:46.625 --> 30:47.677
Yeah.

30:51.430 --> 30:54.078
I-I think it's a very good idea
to give your new boss

30:54.166 --> 30:56.059
a gimme at the start.

31:00.213 --> 31:01.605
Oh.

31:04.047 --> 31:05.922
Okay.

31:07.094 --> 31:09.053
Okay, I may be on thin ice here,

31:09.141 --> 31:11.203
but bear with me, please?

31:13.437 --> 31:14.857
It surprise you at all,

31:14.945 --> 31:17.516
when you got
that big offer from Duke?

31:20.625 --> 31:22.545
It's not like I'm an unknown.

31:22.633 --> 31:25.037
I've had offers
from NYU, Notre Dame...

31:25.125 --> 31:26.498
I know,
I know, I know,

31:26.585 --> 31:28.297
and well, well-deserved.

31:29.945 --> 31:31.503
But not from Duke.

31:31.749 --> 31:34.209
All I'm saying...
is

31:34.304 --> 31:36.133
were you surprised?

31:36.844 --> 31:39.086
Yes, but pleasantly... why?

31:40.121 --> 31:43.162
Well, I know

31:43.258 --> 31:44.513
you like to know

31:44.601 --> 31:46.164
all there is to know.

31:49.319 --> 31:52.001
I'm hoping that's the case here.

31:52.815 --> 31:54.352
Sure.

31:58.086 --> 32:00.793
The advice
to Woodward and Bernstein?

32:15.286 --> 32:18.406
And with that,
the makeup and stage blood.

32:18.494 --> 32:20.271
Got a camera, too,
if you want it.

32:20.359 --> 32:22.758
No. I'll take the picture
with my own phone.

32:23.305 --> 32:25.631
And once I get Joe
to make the final payment,

32:25.719 --> 32:27.756
I'll get a picture of him in handcuffs.
Thank you.

32:27.844 --> 32:29.414
We really gotta
do all this?

32:29.909 --> 32:32.828
Just think of it like
Halloween and you'll be fine.

32:33.008 --> 32:34.218
Where's your partner?

32:34.305 --> 32:36.608
She's keeping an eye on Joe at
The Clasp till we're finished.

32:36.695 --> 32:38.445
Now let's go kill you.

32:38.664 --> 32:39.752
Come on.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.436
Over here.

32:52.526 --> 32:54.752
Huh. It's so deep.

32:55.190 --> 32:57.444
Be glad you didn't
have to dig it.

32:57.770 --> 32:58.945
It's okay.

32:59.033 --> 33:00.730
You're just gonna be
in there for a second.

33:00.925 --> 33:02.058
Just long enough
for me to get

33:02.145 --> 33:03.395
a picture of you looking
like you're dead.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.136
Okay?

33:09.167 --> 33:10.455
Just get you ready.

33:11.513 --> 33:13.002
Thank you, Detective.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.475
Thank me for what?

33:14.921 --> 33:16.018
For believing me.

33:16.106 --> 33:17.369
Why wouldn't I believe you?

33:17.457 --> 33:18.924
'Cause I work in a dump and...

33:20.411 --> 33:22.690
I'm not exactly
an upstanding citizen.

33:22.778 --> 33:26.151
Well... consider it fate.

33:28.203 --> 33:30.526
I need you to close
your eyes, okay?

33:41.097 --> 33:42.576
How do I look?

33:43.041 --> 33:44.455
Horrible.

33:44.840 --> 33:46.363
And perfect.

33:47.210 --> 33:50.169
Why don't you put the flashlight
down, get everything ready.

33:55.446 --> 33:57.049
Put this rope
around your wrists,

33:57.158 --> 33:59.065
make it look like
you're tied up.

33:59.740 --> 34:01.785
I'll lower you down
into the ditch.

34:02.021 --> 34:04.197
Lay on your back and
I'll take the picture.

34:05.166 --> 34:06.557
Reagan!

34:13.737 --> 34:14.821
You called it, Reagan.

34:14.960 --> 34:16.282
A setup every step
of the way.

34:16.370 --> 34:17.980
Like father like daughter.

34:18.405 --> 34:20.094
Surprised you didn't try
to kill me with a pool cue

34:20.181 --> 34:22.054
like your old man did
that college kid.

34:22.252 --> 34:23.321
When did you know?

34:23.485 --> 34:26.914
When you said, "People who hurt
other people should be stopped."

34:27.491 --> 34:28.789
Just like what you
yelled at me

34:28.877 --> 34:30.996
at your old man's trial back
in the day, you remember?

34:31.089 --> 34:32.972
I was ten years old.

34:33.167 --> 34:35.431
And you took my father away.

34:35.690 --> 34:37.300
No.

34:37.684 --> 34:39.643
Your father dug his own grave.

34:40.373 --> 34:41.652
Just like you did.

34:52.833 --> 34:54.183
What's going on?

34:54.512 --> 34:55.893
Boss, I got to talk to you.

34:55.982 --> 34:57.780
Again? Not cop-to-cop.

34:58.827 --> 35:00.345
Woman-to-woman.

35:02.004 --> 35:03.628
Look, my husband...

35:04.267 --> 35:06.400
he wants the
world to think

35:06.488 --> 35:08.490
he's just like his father.

35:08.578 --> 35:10.261
C-Can you get to it?

35:17.946 --> 35:20.996
Jamie and I got in an
argument the other night.

35:22.048 --> 35:25.597
He was pissed because
some guy I know was texting me.

35:25.896 --> 35:27.433
And it wasn't
the first time.

35:27.528 --> 35:29.312
I tried to calm him down,

35:29.400 --> 35:31.042
and...

35:31.605 --> 35:33.175
he grabbed me by the throat.

35:33.285 --> 35:35.785
- Whoa. No...
- Jamie put his hands on you?

35:35.873 --> 35:37.701
No, really,
it wasn't his fault.

35:37.789 --> 35:38.922
I should have
deleted the text.

35:39.009 --> 35:39.923
I-I shouldn't...

35:40.011 --> 35:41.628
Janko, no,
you're not to blame.

35:41.716 --> 35:43.691
Please. I don't want
to jam him up.

35:43.786 --> 35:45.706
We haven't even been
married that long.

35:45.794 --> 35:47.056
That's all
the more reason...

35:47.389 --> 35:48.597
I just...

35:48.779 --> 35:50.667
I want to be the wife
he needs me to be.

35:50.755 --> 35:52.253
Okay.
Hey. No.

35:52.341 --> 35:54.894
Nothing that you do
or anybody else does

35:54.982 --> 35:57.071
gives him the right
to put his hands on you.

35:57.159 --> 35:58.675
Do you understand me?

35:59.045 --> 36:01.855
Jamie having a problem,

36:01.943 --> 36:04.199
that is not
your fault, Janko.

36:07.791 --> 36:09.917
Take your own advice.

36:12.841 --> 36:14.190
What?

36:14.612 --> 36:16.425
Your ex-husband, Steve.

36:17.634 --> 36:19.853
He wasn't a
nice guy, was he?

36:22.124 --> 36:24.183
You talked to
your father-in-law?

36:24.271 --> 36:26.894
No, but I hear
Steve was abusive,

36:26.982 --> 36:29.589
and I'm guessing
he didn't leave that at work.

36:29.677 --> 36:31.277
You don't know
what you're talking about.

36:31.382 --> 36:32.861
He was hitting you.

36:33.197 --> 36:34.416
What?
Wasn't he?

36:35.704 --> 36:37.246
What? No.

36:37.334 --> 36:38.727
Boss, you can hate me,

36:39.038 --> 36:42.152
and the PC and anyone else
for what happened to you.

36:42.613 --> 36:44.464
I know...

36:44.755 --> 36:48.214
that sometimes that's easier
than hating the person

36:48.371 --> 36:50.831
who really made
your life hell.

36:51.818 --> 36:53.160
But...

36:54.671 --> 36:56.934
please forgive yourself.

36:58.038 --> 36:59.370
I mean, like you just said,

36:59.458 --> 37:01.949
nothing you did
made it okay

37:02.037 --> 37:04.449
for him to do
what he did to you.

37:05.752 --> 37:07.292
Nothing.

37:13.413 --> 37:14.980
I should've known
that you were lying

37:15.068 --> 37:17.230
when you said that Jamie
put his hands on you.

37:18.780 --> 37:22.827
But everything I just said about you
is true.

37:30.504 --> 37:33.594
I'll shut up now, like
you always wanted me to.

37:40.613 --> 37:43.126
Well, I'd say justice
was served.

37:43.214 --> 37:45.496
Hopefully, Ms. Volo will
get the help she needs.

37:45.675 --> 37:47.228
Thanks to your testimony.

37:47.316 --> 37:48.697
Happy to help.

37:48.785 --> 37:50.517
And when I call you
for the next case,

37:50.605 --> 37:52.079
you won't hang up on me?

37:52.167 --> 37:54.619
Not even if you want to
talk about anything else.

37:59.637 --> 38:00.855
Hey.

38:01.187 --> 38:02.275
So...

38:02.363 --> 38:03.846
all's well
that ends well?

38:04.027 --> 38:06.298
Yeah. I think that
the judge was surprised

38:06.386 --> 38:08.002
when I changed the
People's recommendation

38:08.089 --> 38:09.509
to psychiatric commitment,

38:09.597 --> 38:11.964
but I think everyone agreed
it was the right thing to do.

38:12.287 --> 38:13.550
I mean us.

38:15.439 --> 38:16.540
You know...

38:16.649 --> 38:18.308
Anthony, you were right.

38:18.550 --> 38:21.542
You were seeing me a lot clearer
than I was seeing myself.

38:22.354 --> 38:23.342
We're a team.

38:23.430 --> 38:26.353
Yeah, but I overreacted,
and I'm sorry.

38:26.441 --> 38:28.033
I'm really sorry.

38:28.121 --> 38:29.486
Apology accepted.

38:29.574 --> 38:31.714
Now lunch.
Wherever you want to go.

38:31.877 --> 38:34.119
Really? Even,
like, fancy?

38:34.207 --> 38:35.439
Why not?

38:35.527 --> 38:37.464
You're paying.

38:39.682 --> 38:40.830
Mayor-Elect Chase.

38:40.918 --> 38:42.006
I'm Detective Baker.

38:42.093 --> 38:43.308
Welcome to One PP.

38:43.396 --> 38:44.530
Nice to meet you.

38:44.617 --> 38:46.010
Would you like
some coffee, water?

38:46.097 --> 38:47.315
I'm good, thank you.

38:47.402 --> 38:49.027
And here we are.

38:51.319 --> 38:53.339
Afternoon.
Frank.

38:53.687 --> 38:55.318
Deputy Commissioner.

38:55.406 --> 38:56.496
Garrett.

38:56.715 --> 38:58.081
Peter.

38:58.174 --> 38:59.698
I know.

38:59.855 --> 39:01.422
This is a surprise.

39:01.579 --> 39:03.519
I know.
I'm full of 'em today.

39:05.735 --> 39:07.346
Would you like to sit down?

39:15.144 --> 39:17.214
Couple things, if I may.

39:17.524 --> 39:19.121
Please.

39:20.886 --> 39:23.105
Guy finds out a job offer came

39:23.250 --> 39:26.244
'cause another guy's wife heads
the Board of Trustees

39:26.332 --> 39:28.480
at the school,
and that together,

39:28.575 --> 39:30.660
they just donated 50 mil

39:30.754 --> 39:32.425
for a new science building.

39:33.838 --> 39:35.378
He does his homework.

39:35.522 --> 39:38.136
Makes the guy think
he's gonna be working

39:38.224 --> 39:39.871
with a whole bunch
of pissed-off people

39:39.959 --> 39:42.266
who got passed over because
they didn't have a hook.

39:42.607 --> 39:45.152
A hook's what we call
"influence" up here.

39:46.545 --> 39:50.238
Makes him...
not want the job so much.

39:52.175 --> 39:56.105
So, did you know he punched
a Sulzberger in the nose

39:56.193 --> 39:58.535
in the Grill Room
at the Four Seasons?

39:59.163 --> 40:00.996
I did not.

40:01.085 --> 40:02.656
He printed a bald-faced lie

40:02.744 --> 40:04.196
about our counterterrorism
division.

40:04.284 --> 40:05.463
He had it coming.

40:05.551 --> 40:08.222
The Timesprinted a correction
the next day,

40:08.310 --> 40:09.572
and an apology
the day after.

40:09.834 --> 40:13.433
We lost the table,
but we won the war.

40:16.023 --> 40:18.496
See, pit bulls get a bad rap.

40:18.584 --> 40:20.699
They're actually
loving protectors

40:20.787 --> 40:22.308
of children and family,

40:22.396 --> 40:23.754
unless you raise 'em mean.

40:23.842 --> 40:26.839
That loving protection
becomes throat-ripping fury

40:26.944 --> 40:28.113
when family's threatened.

40:28.201 --> 40:31.640
This guy just lost 80 pounds
the last year.

40:31.868 --> 40:33.371
And it made him leaner,

40:33.459 --> 40:36.410
but it also made him meaner,
if that's possible.

40:36.635 --> 40:38.277
When I need to be.

40:38.726 --> 40:41.058
Guys, okay.

40:41.203 --> 40:42.949
Okay.

40:43.788 --> 40:45.777
Something you should know
about me.

40:45.934 --> 40:49.300
I don't pave the way
for my people to succeed.

40:49.641 --> 40:51.773
Yeah. You like to put obstacles
in their way

40:51.884 --> 40:53.371
to see how they handle
adversity.

40:53.459 --> 40:54.721
Yeah, we heard.

40:59.464 --> 41:03.540
I run, and he runs
interference for,

41:03.628 --> 41:07.327
35,000 cops who are responsible
for the safety

41:07.448 --> 41:10.540
and well-being
of 8.6 million citizens.

41:10.643 --> 41:13.501
And 65 million tourists.

41:14.444 --> 41:17.650
So we don't have time
for mind games.

41:18.089 --> 41:20.483
We have more than we can handle

41:20.571 --> 41:22.572
on every given day as it is.

41:23.568 --> 41:25.266
"We."

41:26.725 --> 41:28.336
Yeah.

41:32.172 --> 41:34.204
We.

41:36.600 --> 41:38.776
You'd really give up
that kind of money?

41:39.564 --> 41:41.447
You really gonna rub it in?

41:44.521 --> 41:46.876
You'll at least meet
with my candidates?

41:47.651 --> 41:49.566
Of course.

41:51.048 --> 41:54.322
Garrett can always use
another hand on deck.

42:05.059 --> 42:06.625
One last thought.

42:07.352 --> 42:09.118
After I'm sworn in?

42:09.342 --> 42:11.127
What I say goes.

42:12.738 --> 42:14.533
Copy that, boss.
