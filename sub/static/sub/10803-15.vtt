09:37.743 --> 09:44.374
Well, canceling a date like that,
the way he's been so distant lately...

09:44.834 --> 09:48.169

those could be warning signs

09:48.337 --> 09:49.671
that he's losing interest?

09:49.839 --> 09:53.216
Alyssa, I think you're overreacting.

09:54.677 --> 09:55.677
Maybe so.

09:56.470 --> 09:58.888
If I cared about someone
as much as you care about Andrew,

09:59.056 --> 10:02.183
he'd have to do a lot more than cancel
a date before I'd get suspicious.

10:03.519 --> 10:04.561
You're right.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.355
I'm sure
that when this research is over,

10:07.523 --> 10:09.899
things will be back
just the way they were.

10:13.362 --> 10:17.032
Except, of course, that he'll have
to deal with Lieutenant Ogawa.

10:17.241 --> 10:18.366

10:28.336 --> 10:30.170
I only filled in at Ops for a half hour,

into something?

into Cardassian territory?

on the beam by at least 7 percent.

- Mr. La Forge.
- I'm on it, captain.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.502
- There, try that.
- The pod is still too far away.

what's going on?

No, do you?

- Ensign.
- Sir.

15:09.450 --> 15:12.827
Excuse me, sir. If you don't mind,
I'd like to stay on for another shift.

You are a certified pilot, ensign?

Yes, sir.

How long have you served onboard
the Enterprise, ensign?

16:10.552 --> 16:11.719
Seven months, sir.

- I do, sir.

16:17.559 --> 16:20.228
I'm not so sure.
I'm concerned about your record.

16:20.854 --> 16:23.523
- Sir?
- The incident that you were involved in

16:23.691 --> 16:24.732
at the Academy.

16:25.734 --> 16:26.818
With all due respect,

16:26.986 --> 16:28.653
that was three years ago.
My record since--

16:28.821 --> 16:31.406
It doesn't matter
how long ago it was, ensign.

16:31.573 --> 16:33.324
Would you do something
like that again?

16:33.951 --> 16:37.078
I can assure you, sir,
that I would never,

16:37.246 --> 16:39.288
never jeopardize lives
by participating in--

16:39.456 --> 16:43.751
In a daredevil stunt?
I would certainly hope not.

16:43.919 --> 16:47.422
But what concerns me
is that you participated in a cover-up

16:47.589 --> 16:51.676
that impeded an official investigation
into the death of a cadet.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.345
Sir, I know I should have told the truth
from the start.

16:54.513 --> 16:57.557
Yes, you should, but you didn't.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.851
Instead, you joined with the others

17:00.019 --> 17:03.479
to pretend that that was simply
an accident.

17:04.106 --> 17:07.233
Now, what do you think that tells me
about your character?

17:10.029 --> 17:13.990
Sir, if you had any idea what it was like
after that incident...

17:14.158 --> 17:16.701
I didn't have any friends.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.787
I didn't have anyone to talk to.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.873
I had to take my flight test
with the instructor

17:22.041 --> 17:24.751
because no one else
would be my partner.

17:24.918 --> 17:29.047
In a lot of ways, it would have
been easier to walk away, but I didn't.

17:29.339 --> 17:31.049
I stuck with it.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.801
Doesn't that say something
about my character too?

17:33.969 --> 17:36.137
Well, I'm really very sorry
you didn't enjoy your time

17:36.305 --> 17:38.389
at the Academy, ensign.

17:38.766 --> 17:41.684
As far as I'm concerned, you should
have been expelled for what you did.

17:43.020 --> 17:46.814
Quite frankly, l don't know
how you made it onboard this ship.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.234
You're dismissed.

18:02.831 --> 18:05.166
Another two seconds.

18:06.543 --> 18:07.710
Okay, that's enough.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.923
Sir.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.342
I'm a little puzzled.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.053
Why are we intentionally damaging
the shuttlecraft?

18:18.347 --> 18:21.015
We're evaluating hull resiliency.

18:21.183 --> 18:25.269
- Starfleet requires periodic testing.
- I see.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.689
I don't believe l'm familiar
with that requirement.

18:30.484 --> 18:33.152
Probably because
you're not a senior officer.

18:34.863 --> 18:36.447
If you wish,

18:36.615 --> 18:39.158
I could reconfigure the phaser
to fire a low-intensity burst

18:39.326 --> 18:41.244
that would not harm
the shuttle's hull.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.204
The test procedure
would not be affected.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.832
It's fine just the way it is.

18:45.999 --> 18:50.461
Now, give me another burst
about four seconds, right here.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.505
Do you want me to fire
from this position?

18:53.590 --> 18:55.508
Actually, why don't you do it
from over here?

18:56.051 --> 18:58.803
That would be consistent.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.180
Consistent with what?

19:04.560 --> 19:08.813
With making it appear
that this shuttle had fled an attack.

19:12.442 --> 19:14.652
What makes you think
that's what we're doing?

19:15.154 --> 19:16.571
The pattern of fire you've asked for

19:16.738 --> 19:20.491
is similar to what might result
if the shuttle had fled an attacker

19:20.659 --> 19:22.743
while engaging
in evasive maneuvers.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.164
It's an amazing coincidence.

19:27.124 --> 19:29.250
Yes, sir. It is indeed.

19:29.835 --> 19:34.172
- Shall we proceed with the testing?
- Yes, ensign. Thank you.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.930
Alyssa, thank you
for coming so quickly.

19:43.098 --> 19:44.473
We have to prepare for surgery.

We have a comatose patient
with a subdural hematoma.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.519
- Yes, sir.
- I wanna make it clear.

19:48.687 --> 19:51.022
- You are not to discuss what you see.
- I understand.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.942
We'll need to synthesize at least a liter
of Cardassian blood.

20:06.246 --> 20:07.872
It's your bet, Taurik.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.081
What l can't understand,

20:09.249 --> 20:13.461
is why are we just sitting here so close
to the Cardassian border?

20:13.629 --> 20:16.631
It must have something to do
with that escape pod we picked up.

20:16.798 --> 20:19.634
- Don't you think, Sito?
- Maybe.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.803
- Wonder who was in it.
- You know what I heard?

20:25.098 --> 20:28.309
- It was Ambassador Spock.
- That is most unlikely.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.478
BEN: That's what I was told.
- By whom?

20:30.646 --> 20:31.979
I can't say.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.315
They beamed whoever was in it
straight to Sickbay.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.317

when you were down there?

20:37.319 --> 20:41.197
No. Dr. Crusher just asked me to
help her with the laboratory schedule.

20:42.282 --> 20:45.534
I thought Lieutenant Powell
was gonna join us tonight.

20:45.702 --> 20:47.078
He had to do a double shift.

20:48.163 --> 20:49.247
That's too bad.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.999
He must be the worst poker player
I've ever met.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.418
It's your bet, Sam.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.346

21:06.640 --> 21:09.267
The thing is, l saw Powell
in Ten-Forward with another woman,

21:09.434 --> 21:11.852
and the way they were talking,
it made me wonder.

21:12.020 --> 21:14.272
Well, if he's seeing someone else,
he should tell Alyssa.

21:14.439 --> 21:17.316

but it would be better in the long run.

about something, Mr. Worf.

I won't be getting it.

22:04.281 --> 22:05.906

22:07.743 --> 22:10.369

a chance to prove herself,

22:10.537 --> 22:12.246
she will not disappoint you.

22:12.414 --> 22:14.332
Very well,
I'll take her under consideration.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.876
Besides, I'm not convinced
about Lavelle.

22:17.044 --> 22:20.171
- Really? Why?
- He's too eager to please.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.049
He's always trying
to ingratiate himself to me.

22:23.216 --> 22:25.593
Why assume he's doing that
to get the job?

22:26.762 --> 22:27.762
Fifty.

There's your 50 and 1 00 more.

22:34.061 --> 22:37.938
I don't know. It seems to me
that you and Lavelle are a lot alike.

22:38.106 --> 22:39.732
What?

22:40.108 --> 22:43.027
- We're not at all alike.
- You're bluffing.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.238
You think so?

22:47.074 --> 22:50.701
Yes, and I'm not gonna let you
get away with it.

22:59.920 --> 23:03.714
You know, Sam, maybe you
shouldn't try so hard with Riker.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.967
It doesn't matter whether he likes you,
as long as he respects you.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.428
He must, otherwise
he would not be considering you

23:09.596 --> 23:11.013
for the Ops position.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.474
You're probably right.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.476
Maybe I'm just telling myself
that he hates me,

23:15.644 --> 23:18.437
so that if I don't get promoted,
I'll have an excuse.

23:18.605 --> 23:20.272
You in or not?

23:39.918 --> 23:42.628

for the counselor.

- Ah. Three sixes.
- Fold.

23:49.636 --> 23:53.097
- Think you can go another 50?
- I'm thinking, give me a second here.

23:54.307 --> 23:55.933
Didn't you tell me
that you took up poker

23:56.101 --> 23:58.561

atthe Potemkin?

23:59.271 --> 24:00.646
I happen to like poker.

24:01.606 --> 24:03.732
But your senior officers
might have thought

24:03.900 --> 24:06.735
that you were trying
to ingratiate yourself.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.737
I guess it's lucky that they realized

24:08.905 --> 24:10.865
that you were young
and inexperienced,

24:11.032 --> 24:13.868
and decided not to hold it
against you.

24:14.369 --> 24:15.744
Hm.

on Lavelle.

- I do. There you go.

to answer that, do you?

he seemed annoyed.

Oh, I've gotta get some sleep
so I can be sharp tomorrow.

26:06.982 --> 26:10.025
Why? So you can get promoted,
have more responsibility

26:10.193 --> 26:12.653

even earlier?

I just cleaned out some junior officers,
and I thought l'd do the same here.

You're welcome to give it a try.

27:04.372 --> 27:06.373
I believe you may be ready
to participate.

27:06.541 --> 27:10.878
However, before you can join the
group, you must pass the gik'tal.

27:11.671 --> 27:15.883
- Gik'tal?
- Yes, it is a very ancient Klingon ritual.

27:16.051 --> 27:18.844
It tests your knowledge of the forms
of the mok'bara.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.722
- I should practice first.
- No.

27:21.890 --> 27:27.811
No practice. That is part of the ritual.
The test must be unannounced.

27:34.402 --> 27:35.736
- Can you see?
- No.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.279
Good.

It's not a fair test.

Very good, ensign.
You have passed the challenge.

29:06.077 --> 29:08.203
What, by taking off the blindfold?

29:08.663 --> 29:11.999
It takes courage
to say the test is unfair.

29:14.627 --> 29:16.795
One thing I don't understand.

29:26.222 --> 29:29.433
Is there really such a thing
as a gik'tal challenge?

29:30.059 --> 29:32.352
No, there is not.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.980
But perhaps next time
you are judged unfairly,

29:35.148 --> 29:38.901
it will not take so many bruises
for you to protest.

29:47.619 --> 29:51.705
All l've ever wanted is to make a career
for myself in Starfleet.

29:52.081 --> 29:55.167
I can't change what happened
at the Academy. No one can.

29:55.335 --> 29:56.794
All l can do is work hard,

29:56.961 --> 29:59.713
and try to earn the respect
of the people I serve with.

If you're not going to give me
that chance, then I respectfully request

30:02.884 --> 30:04.551
that you transfer me to another ship.

If you're looking
for a more lenient commander,

you should have said so
when I was assigned to it.

for what l did at the Academy.

It took courage to come here
and face me

30:45.844 --> 30:48.470
after what l said to you
the other day.

30:48.638 --> 30:49.680
I didn't ask you here

30:49.848 --> 30:54.059
because I was assessing
your qualifications for the Ops position.

30:54.227 --> 30:55.769
I don't understand, sir.

30:55.937 --> 30:58.730
I was harsh with you,
because I wanted to assess you

30:58.898 --> 31:01.191

31:01.359 --> 31:04.736
A mission
that could put you in a situation

31:04.904 --> 31:07.781
that would be far more unnerving
than a dressing-down

31:07.949 --> 31:09.074
by your commanding officer.

Can l ask what that mission is, sir?

- Yes. Alyssa.

I've come to depend upon you here.

someone I really care about.

- A secret?
- He asked me to marry him.

32:31.991 --> 32:36.495

I'm so relieved. I mean, happy.

32:43.211 --> 32:45.003
Please, take a seat, ensign.

32:55.223 --> 32:56.807
This is Joret Dal.

32:57.850 --> 33:00.519
He was in the escape pod
that we retrieved.

33:00.687 --> 33:03.397
He is a member
of the Cardassian military,

33:03.564 --> 33:05.399
and a Federation operative.

33:06.567 --> 33:10.320
He has risked his life
to bring us invaluable information

33:10.488 --> 33:13.407
about Cardassian
strategic intentions.

33:13.574 --> 33:17.911
Information that could very well
enhance the security of Bajor,

33:18.079 --> 33:20.122
as well as other planets
in this sector.

33:20.289 --> 33:22.499
Now, it is absolutely imperative

33:22.667 --> 33:25.544
that we return him safely
to Cardassian space.

33:25.712 --> 33:27.796
It will not be easy.

33:27.964 --> 33:29.506
The border is heavily guarded.

33:29.674 --> 33:32.217
Since his ship was destroyed,
he'll be using one of our shuttles.

33:32.385 --> 33:35.053
If a patrol stops me,
I will claim to have stolen it.

33:35.221 --> 33:36.638
We have distressed the shuttle,

33:36.806 --> 33:38.807
so that it appears
to have been fired upon.

33:39.350 --> 33:42.060
Joret will attempt
to talk his way past the patrol.

33:42.603 --> 33:46.606
If I were alone, the chances
of my succeeding would be slim.

33:46.774 --> 33:50.402
But if I had a prisoner with me,
a Bajoran terrorist,

33:51.237 --> 33:53.321
I would appear
to be a bounty hunter.

33:53.489 --> 33:57.284
Border crossings of that nature
are not uncommon, and for a price,

33:57.452 --> 33:59.703
the patrol can be convinced
to look the other way.

34:00.288 --> 34:02.789
Once the shuttle is safely past
the patrol,

34:02.957 --> 34:06.877
Joret will put you into an escape pod,
and return you back across the border.

34:07.045 --> 34:10.005
Since the pod is so small,
it will be difficult to detect.

34:10.173 --> 34:12.090
We'll be waiting here to pick you up.

34:12.258 --> 34:13.633
I understand, sir.

a very dangerous mission.

to take part in it.

has been lost in the line of duty.

41:28.110 --> 41:32.447
She was the finest example
of a Starfleet officer,

41:32.615 --> 41:35.200
and a young woman
of remarkable courage

41:35.576 --> 41:38.328
and strength of character.

41:40.122 --> 41:43.666
Her loss will be deeply felt
by all who knew her.

41:44.293 --> 41:45.960
Picard, out.

42:14.365 --> 42:16.407
- You okay?
ALYSSA: Uh-huh.

42:26.210 --> 42:27.502
LAVELLE:
I just got promoted.

42:28.671 --> 42:30.588
Congratulations.

42:30.756 --> 42:32.423
Thanks.

42:33.467 --> 42:35.552
It just doesn't feel right.

42:35.719 --> 42:37.387
For all I know,

42:37.555 --> 42:39.931
she was gonna get the promotion
instead of me.

42:40.099 --> 42:41.558
You shouldn't feel that way, Sam.

42:42.142 --> 42:44.102
She would have been happy
for you, Sam.

42:44.270 --> 42:46.479
The best way to remember her

42:46.647 --> 42:49.941
would be to excel
in your new position.

42:55.573 --> 42:56.823
We're proud of you, Sam.

43:02.079 --> 43:04.914
Excuse me, sir,
but I need to move this table.

43:07.293 --> 43:08.668
What?

43:08.836 --> 43:11.337
There's an empty seat over there.

43:16.135 --> 43:23.016
I appreciate what you are trying to do,
but it is not appropriate.

43:23.183 --> 43:26.603
You were her friends.
I was only her commanding officer.

43:26.770 --> 43:31.190
Sir, I happen to know
that she considered you a friend.
