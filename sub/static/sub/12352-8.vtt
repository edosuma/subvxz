WEBVTT

00:06.644 --> 00:08.345
That goat should have been ours.
Mark my words,

00:08.379 --> 00:09.699
you KTs are gonna pay for that.

00:09.700 --> 00:11.868
I know something good happened
to me last night.

00:11.869 --> 00:13.071
He's my little brother.

00:13.072 --> 00:14.523
You can't go messing with
him unless you're sure.

00:14.558 --> 00:16.623
Are you really 
into that professor guy,

00:16.624 --> 00:19.257
or is there someone else
that you have feelings for?

00:19.258 --> 00:21.497
Yes, I am really into Simon.

00:21.531 --> 00:23.554
So there's nothing 
happening between us.

00:23.783 --> 00:25.250
I wanna show 
the girl who claims

00:25.285 --> 00:27.653
she doesn't believe in love
how much she means to me.

00:27.654 --> 00:28.766
Your instincts are telling you

00:28.767 --> 00:30.555
that you deserve better, and you do.

00:30.589 --> 00:32.756
Do you love the law and
law school more than me?

00:32.791 --> 00:34.959
I have enough pressure in my life as it is.

00:34.993 --> 00:37.061
And if you can't deal, that's your problem.

00:37.096 --> 00:39.097
I deserve better. Even Casey thinks so.

00:39.131 --> 00:41.199
Where do you get off telling
Rebecca to break up with me?

00:41.233 --> 00:42.759
Just watch your back in law school,

00:42.760 --> 00:44.068
'cause now the gloves are off.

00:45.637 --> 00:47.538
Ultimately, it's a question
of responsibility.

00:47.573 --> 00:48.681
The fundamental issue

00:48.682 --> 00:51.375
underlying all contributory negligence.
But how so?

00:51.410 --> 00:53.744
Was a person injured by his own actions...?

00:53.779 --> 00:57.048
Or is there another party who
should be held responsible

00:57.082 --> 00:59.517
for his or her part in what happened?

01:00.819 --> 01:03.221
Interesting. We'll start there next time.

01:03.255 --> 01:06.057
I'd like to remind everyone that
Mock Trial begins this week,

01:06.091 --> 01:07.567
and I will be selecting

01:07.568 --> 01:10.328
my new research assistant from the winners.

01:10.362 --> 01:12.063
So there's your carrot. Now, our case.

01:12.097 --> 01:14.165
Imagine this: A pharmaceutical company,

01:14.199 --> 01:18.169
let's call it Evil Corp, wants
to donate a boatload of money

01:18.203 --> 01:21.839
to a hypothetical university,
we'll call that H.U.,

01:21.874 --> 01:23.841
for campus expansion. Only problem,

01:23.876 --> 01:27.311
there's a tiny mom-and-pop puppy
shop holding on for dear life

01:27.346 --> 01:29.390
right where the university wants to expand.

01:29.391 --> 01:30.678
Sucks for the puppies.

01:30.713 --> 01:33.281
Thank you for that lovely insight,
Mr. Chambers.

01:33.315 --> 01:35.450
Who wants to represent mom-and-pop?

01:35.484 --> 01:38.686
Ah! Big surprise.
We'll be working in teams of two,

01:38.721 --> 01:41.389
so who wants to pair with Ms. Cartwright?

01:42.279 --> 01:44.136
- Katherine.
- I'm in. As an MBA,

01:44.137 --> 01:46.205
I'm gonna spend my life pandering
to large conglomerates.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.707
This will be a nice palate cleanser for me.

01:47.741 --> 01:50.076
And who wants to go up
against this formidable duo,

01:50.110 --> 01:53.980
defending Evil Corp?

01:54.014 --> 01:56.616
- Mr. Chambers. - What the hell.
Everyone needs a lawyer, right?

01:56.650 --> 01:57.732
Except when you're

01:57.733 --> 02:00.620
representing yourself in
an acrimonious divorce.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.755
You son of a bitch.

02:02.789 --> 02:07.360
- Looks like I need a new partner.
- Really!

02:07.394 --> 02:11.230
OK. Good to see the competitive
spirit is alive and well.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.865
May the best team win.

02:14.534 --> 02:15.801
Don't talk to me.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.671
Hey. Are we OK?

02:18.705 --> 02:21.173
What happened with Rebecca,
that's personal.

02:21.208 --> 02:23.643
We shouldn't let it affect law school.

02:23.677 --> 02:26.879
- This is professional, right?
- Oh, it's totally personal.

02:32.252 --> 02:33.640
Hear ye, brethren!

02:33.641 --> 02:36.155
Your faithful pledge chair
has been hard at work,

02:36.189 --> 02:40.259
preparing for CRU's annual
Pledge Talent Show.

02:41.762 --> 02:45.398
Normally, we'd be rehearsing KT's original

02:45.432 --> 02:47.533
A Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to Brokeback Mountain.

02:47.567 --> 02:48.486
Such a classic.

02:48.487 --> 02:53.005
But since we're faced with
a pledge class of one,

02:53.040 --> 02:56.542
well, without further ado,
I give you Pledge Spidey!

02:56.576 --> 02:59.011
Whoa!

03:02.749 --> 03:05.551
I didn't look at myself
probably until college.

03:05.585 --> 03:08.387
I don't even say the word to my ob-gyn.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.990
The Vagina Monologues!
Who knew they could talk?

03:11.024 --> 03:13.225
- Hey, guys.
- Speaking of...

03:13.260 --> 03:15.961
Just doin' the rounds.
New scholarship chairs

03:15.996 --> 03:19.899
- of Panhellenic and IFC, respectively.
- Or respect-less-ly.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.923
So, super bummed to tell you

03:21.924 --> 03:24.146
that KT is officially
on academic probation.

03:24.147 --> 03:26.238
Uh, officially not possible.

03:26.273 --> 03:28.941
Really? Because it looks like
your brother, Joshua Whopper,

03:28.975 --> 03:33.446
is flunking everything. Straight F's.
Which one is he again?

03:33.480 --> 03:35.648
- He's a blonde, short...
- Dark-haired, tall...

03:35.682 --> 03:37.249
Asian in the basement.

03:37.284 --> 03:41.153
Well, unless Josh gets his
academic ass in gear,

03:41.188 --> 03:45.124
KT is not long for this world.
Or Greek Row.

03:50.630 --> 03:52.565
How could Joshua Whopper fail?

03:52.599 --> 03:55.301
First our rush party, then
our fake philanthropy

03:55.335 --> 03:58.971
- and now Joshua Whopper?
- These aren't just pranks.

03:59.005 --> 04:02.441
Omega Chi is officially out to destroy us.

04:07.914 --> 04:15.772
Sync by YYeTs.net
www.addic7ed.com

04:16.300 --> 04:19.406
Josh Whopper has gone from
practically all A's to all F's.

04:19.408 --> 04:21.075
Just change them back, Spitter.

04:21.076 --> 04:22.989
Even if I could figure out a way to get in,

04:22.990 --> 04:24.907
IFC would know we messed with the system.

04:24.908 --> 04:26.278
If it's hard for you to figure out,

04:26.279 --> 04:28.276
how did the dim-witted
preppies at Omega Chi do it?

04:29.745 --> 04:34.883
Maybe their new, non-dim-witted,
non-preppy pledge

04:34.917 --> 04:37.430
- helped them out.
- Dale? Come on.

04:37.431 --> 04:40.400
He wouldn't do something that
could shut down our house.

04:40.434 --> 04:43.303
- He's my best friend.
- Your best friend who started U-SAG.

04:43.337 --> 04:45.204
And Trip's his big brother.

04:45.239 --> 04:48.474
Did you ever tell Daley about
our academic support system?

04:48.509 --> 04:51.938
OK, I did, but I never
thought he would go Greek.

04:53.847 --> 04:55.648
This hurts me as much as it hurts you.

04:55.649 --> 04:57.450
Daley won't even do book club anymore.

04:57.484 --> 05:00.720
Even after I shared my erotic
fixation on the Bronte sisters.

05:00.754 --> 05:01.699
Let's just face it,

05:01.700 --> 05:06.426
he's officially a full-on
Omega Chi world dominatrix.

05:06.460 --> 05:09.095
- I'll talk to him.
- Good idea.

05:09.129 --> 05:11.484
I'm supposed to go to this job
fair thing with Ashleigh.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.066
Oh, tell her I said hi.

05:13.100 --> 05:15.568
- Isn't she your roommate?
- She hasn't been around much,

05:15.603 --> 05:19.872
she's been spending time with Mr.
Tall, Dark and Stupid.

05:19.907 --> 05:21.578
Anyways, I was gonna go

05:21.579 --> 05:24.777
contemplate my future
or some such nonsense,

05:24.812 --> 05:26.613
but this seems way more important.

05:26.647 --> 05:29.722
Go to the job fair. Plan your future.
This one's on me.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:39.627 --> 05:41.657
Um, Rebecca?

05:41.658 --> 05:44.464
Do you maybe wanna maybe
back away from the fireplace

05:44.498 --> 05:46.833
and come help with the Pledge Talent Show?

05:49.236 --> 05:52.038
Teach them the dance, get them ready.
I'm president.

05:52.072 --> 05:53.806
I do final touches only.

05:56.977 --> 05:58.511
Ok.

06:04.318 --> 06:08.788
- Ex-boyfriend bonfire?
- Incredibly therapeutic.

06:08.822 --> 06:12.725
I can't believe I ever fell for
Evan's "Open your heart up" Crap.

06:12.760 --> 06:13.664
He's the last person

06:13.665 --> 06:16.295
I should be taking advice
from on how to be happy.

06:16.330 --> 06:18.798
Well, he's anything but happy.

06:18.832 --> 06:20.633
And apparently, he's
taking it all out on me.

06:20.668 --> 06:22.993
I'm going up against him in Mock Trial.

06:24.204 --> 06:25.464
Please kick his ass.

06:28.375 --> 06:30.322
Uh, that can't be good for the environment.

06:30.323 --> 06:31.577
He made me a playlist once.

06:31.612 --> 06:33.893
I don't want a single reminder
of what an idiot I was.

06:33.894 --> 06:34.847
You're not an idiot.

06:34.882 --> 06:36.582
And Evan's not a horrible person.

06:36.617 --> 06:38.785
Oh, please. You're the one who
told me to break up with him.

06:38.819 --> 06:40.848
That was girlfriend bathroom advice!

06:40.849 --> 06:42.822
Why is everyone pinning this on me?

06:45.426 --> 06:49.062
All I'm saying is that Evan
has good qualities, too.

06:49.096 --> 06:51.464
If he didn't, you wouldn't have
been with him in the first place.

06:51.498 --> 06:52.876
You can keep telling yourself

06:52.877 --> 06:54.967
that Evan's basically a
good guy underneath,

06:55.002 --> 06:57.570
but don't be surprised if
you get your ass burned.

07:02.276 --> 07:03.910
Hey, um, thanks for coming with.

07:03.944 --> 07:05.812
I know things have been
kind of weird between us,

07:05.846 --> 07:09.148
but now we have time to bond.
You can make nice

07:09.183 --> 07:11.684
with your once-again girlfriend's
once-again best friend.

07:11.719 --> 07:16.522
Absolutely. And if I end up
with a job, too, so be it.

07:16.557 --> 07:18.725
Did you just say the "J-word"?

07:18.759 --> 07:21.894
Just look at this place.
It's like the food court of futures!

07:21.929 --> 07:24.731
Yeah, and they suck you in
with those free luggage tags.

07:24.765 --> 07:27.900
Which imply that you have luggage,
and that you're going places.

07:27.935 --> 07:29.013
Which I better be soon,

07:29.014 --> 07:31.170
'cause I can't sleep on
Rusty's futon forever.

07:31.205 --> 07:35.308
- Oh, he says hi, by the way.
- Oh... Hi.

07:35.342 --> 07:39.779
Anyway, there's also the matter
of the $300 Dobler's bill

07:39.813 --> 07:42.381
from Calvin's birthday with my name on it.

07:42.416 --> 07:44.884
Actually, your name is on it, too.

07:44.918 --> 07:48.788
Right, and if one of these fine
firms takes a shine to me,

07:48.822 --> 07:50.757
I may actually be able
to pay you back one day.

07:50.791 --> 07:53.726
- Cool.
- Oh, my God!

07:53.761 --> 07:56.435
The CIA! How high of a pay grade

07:56.436 --> 07:57.930
do you think you need to
have a license to kill?

07:57.965 --> 08:00.651
- You're good, right?
- Yeah.

08:02.836 --> 08:03.903
Ok...

08:08.142 --> 08:11.577
- 'Sup, girlfriend?
- Professor Clarissa!

08:11.612 --> 08:14.413
Just Clarissa, gal pal.
You graduated. We're peeps now.

08:14.448 --> 08:18.551
So, how's my former star student?

08:18.585 --> 08:21.187
- In the market for a marketing job?
- Actually, yeah.

08:21.221 --> 08:23.556
- Do you know anyone who's hiring?
- Me!

08:23.590 --> 08:25.158
I've started my own firm.

08:25.192 --> 08:27.860
I'm the missing link between
stodgy corporations

08:27.895 --> 08:29.796
and the untapped youth
market here in Cyprus.

08:29.830 --> 08:33.832
And I'm doing it all through mobisodes.
Check it out.

08:33.866 --> 08:36.402
Hey, Cheesarito Man.

08:36.403 --> 08:38.938
You wanna go to an underground rave?

08:38.972 --> 08:42.275
- Totally. Which way?
- Follow me.

08:42.308 --> 08:44.210
You never know what'll happen next.

08:44.244 --> 08:47.780
Rock on! This is so college!

08:47.815 --> 08:51.884
- Huh. It's catchy.
- We need to work on content.

08:51.919 --> 08:54.420
But I'd love to have you on board.

08:54.454 --> 08:56.122
Whaddaya say, home-skillet?

08:56.156 --> 08:58.391
Let's have a latte tomorrow to discuss.

08:58.425 --> 09:01.627
- OK. You buying?
- Absolument. Four pm.

09:01.662 --> 09:04.197
- See you at the E-Farm.
- Cool.

09:08.368 --> 09:11.204
Yeah, and I'm being
recruited by Heidi Klum.

09:11.238 --> 09:13.105
- Sir?
- Oh.

09:13.140 --> 09:15.875
I think you left this at our table.

09:15.909 --> 09:18.644
Thank you for your interest in the Company.

09:19.413 --> 09:20.847
We'll be in touch.

09:23.116 --> 09:24.717
- Oh, my God!
- I know!

09:24.751 --> 09:27.887
I am so the next Jason Bourne.
I love this job fair.

09:27.921 --> 09:29.355
Why did I never come here before?

09:29.389 --> 09:31.891
Whoa...

09:36.530 --> 09:39.432
Hey. Dale's been in there for half an hour.

09:40.868 --> 09:44.070
Oh! No, he's not doing that.
I've been listening at the door.

09:44.104 --> 09:45.705
A blow dryer was involved.

09:45.739 --> 09:47.506
Why don't you just tell me what you know?

09:47.541 --> 09:49.675
No, I got nothing. Even if I did,

09:49.710 --> 09:51.911
my relationship with the
house is great right now.

09:51.945 --> 09:53.479
I'm not going behind their backs again.

09:53.513 --> 09:55.781
Hey, Rus. Brother Owens.

09:55.816 --> 09:56.765
If you're trying to get him

09:56.766 --> 09:58.384
to spill details about
our Pledge Talent Show,

09:58.418 --> 09:59.965
- he's in the dark.
- No, actually,

09:59.966 --> 10:01.954
I wanted to talk to you
about something else.

10:01.989 --> 10:06.325
Did Trip ask you to mess with
KT's academic booster seat?

10:06.360 --> 10:08.000
You mean Joshua Whopper?

10:08.001 --> 10:09.528
Did you guys finally get caught with that?

10:09.563 --> 10:11.030
Real men study for their grades.

10:11.064 --> 10:13.232
Do real men mess with their friends

10:13.267 --> 10:15.635
just to get in with a bunch
of dim-witted preppies?

10:15.669 --> 10:18.304
Stop thinking that I have to do
stuff to get in with these guys.

10:18.338 --> 10:20.806
- Back me up here, Cal.
- He's right. You have no proof.

10:20.841 --> 10:22.341
They're doing things for me.

10:22.376 --> 10:24.810
Trip gave me his ex-girlfriend.
That's right,

10:24.845 --> 10:27.380
there's a new Mrs. K candidate.
What have you done for me lately?

10:29.216 --> 10:31.951
Hi, Daley! Super excited for tonight.

10:31.985 --> 10:34.520
Shouldn't you be studying?

10:34.554 --> 10:36.401
Don't you just wanna put
her in your pocket?

10:38.525 --> 10:40.059
Bye, guys.

10:42.863 --> 10:44.630
Dale's dating Natalie,

10:44.665 --> 10:47.633
who just happened to bust
us with Trip earlier?

11:09.323 --> 11:12.625
Do you have a copy of Berman v. Parker?

11:12.659 --> 11:15.695
Are you... Are you asking me for help?

11:15.729 --> 11:19.598
I thought you were hating on me.
Personally and professionally.

11:19.633 --> 11:21.002
Well, I'm just trying to

11:21.003 --> 11:23.569
get through all this
material, but forget it.

11:25.639 --> 11:28.574
It's in our casebook, in
one of the appendices.

11:29.343 --> 11:30.376
Thanks.

11:39.086 --> 11:43.289
- You OK?
- Yeah. I'm just a little bit, uh,

11:43.323 --> 11:45.691
- distracted.
- What's going on?

11:45.726 --> 11:47.126
Nothing you have to worry about.

11:47.160 --> 11:49.061
Go prep your side. This isn't your problem.

11:49.096 --> 11:50.896
Oh, come on, I am a House Mother.

11:50.931 --> 11:52.999
It can't be any worse than Madison's shame

11:53.033 --> 11:55.334
over her hairy toes.

11:56.003 --> 11:57.770
All right, fine.

11:59.106 --> 12:03.709
The truth is, I miss Rebecca, like, a lot.

12:03.744 --> 12:06.912
- Oh, Evan.
- No, I know. It's all I can think about,

12:06.947 --> 12:08.207
and I really don't have the time.

12:08.208 --> 12:12.551
Because I've gotta defend,
like, five different things.

12:12.586 --> 12:13.986
I don't even know where to start.

12:16.923 --> 12:22.261
Well, if you need a place to start,
like, a tiny leg up, um...

12:22.295 --> 12:24.400
It turns out that Pop of Mom-and-Pop

12:24.401 --> 12:27.033
Puppy Shop put up a sign
attacking Evil Corp.

12:27.067 --> 12:28.530
"Big Pharma Kills," That kind of thing.

12:28.531 --> 12:30.069
And the university made him take it down.

12:30.103 --> 12:32.038
Really? I didn't know
anything about a sign.

12:32.072 --> 12:34.440
We got the information when
we interviewed our client.

12:34.474 --> 12:38.177
OK. So you guys are going for
the First Amendment angle?

12:38.211 --> 12:41.647
Well, it's, uh, one option.

12:43.316 --> 12:46.118
- So about Rebecca...
- Yeah, uh...

12:48.355 --> 12:50.623
God, you're so easy.

12:52.025 --> 12:53.592
- You faked me out?
- Yeah...

12:53.627 --> 12:56.195
- With the sympathy card?
- I said gloves are off.

12:56.229 --> 12:58.297
I'll see you in court, counselor.

12:58.331 --> 12:59.545
Oh!

13:12.204 --> 13:13.733
Hey. What was the emergency?

13:13.734 --> 13:15.535
Walter and I were rather
indisposed when you called.

13:15.570 --> 13:18.538
- Yeah, I got that.
- Did you know the G-spot

13:18.573 --> 13:19.993
is not, in fact, a myth created

13:19.994 --> 13:22.375
to perpetuate a patriarchal
need for male genitalia,

13:22.410 --> 13:25.946
but rather it's a pleasure
dome of unexplored adventure?

13:25.980 --> 13:30.484
So, um, you're in a good mood?

13:30.518 --> 13:32.486
That's great, because, um,

13:32.520 --> 13:35.722
we have to abandon our
First Amendment argument

13:35.756 --> 13:38.458
and come up with a new
strategy for the case.

13:38.493 --> 13:40.527
Um, why? The First Amendment angle

13:40.561 --> 13:43.830
was the only sexy thing about our case.
It was our G-spot.

13:43.865 --> 13:46.333
If you will.

13:46.367 --> 13:49.269
Well, I may have let it slip to Evan

13:49.303 --> 13:51.771
that that is the argument we'd be using.

13:51.806 --> 13:54.141
Casey, I'm quite aware that not all

13:54.142 --> 13:57.611
individuals are members of
the subclass Plagiostomi.

13:57.645 --> 13:58.651
Sharks. I know you don't

13:58.652 --> 14:00.413
have the shark gene, Casey, which is fine.

14:00.448 --> 14:03.083
- Most of the time.
- No, I have... I can be a shark!

14:03.117 --> 14:05.986
I just thought I was helping
my former good friend

14:06.020 --> 14:08.121
who seemed to be in bad shape.

14:08.155 --> 14:09.489
OK, see, a shark would not do that.

14:09.524 --> 14:11.591
Having sensed Evan's weakened state,

14:11.626 --> 14:15.929
a shark would just...
tear him limb from limb.

14:15.963 --> 14:19.132
God, I'm... I'm sorry, Katherine.

14:19.166 --> 14:21.601
- I really screwed up.
- It's OK.

14:21.636 --> 14:23.370
We just have a lot of work to do.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.274
Mmm! Thanks for the Pop-Tarts, Rus.

14:27.308 --> 14:30.277
Of course, nothing compares
to your home-cooking, Dale.

14:30.311 --> 14:31.885
Flattery will get you nowhere.

14:35.449 --> 14:38.618
All right. I gotta go to
Pledge Talent Show practice.

14:38.653 --> 14:41.288
Make sure you barnyard animals
clean up your detritus.

14:41.322 --> 14:43.173
Hey, Dale. Have a nice day.

14:43.174 --> 14:45.025
Yeah, hey, see you around, Dale!

14:45.059 --> 14:46.927
- Take care!
- All right.

14:49.397 --> 14:50.664
OK, so, what's...?

14:56.404 --> 15:01.441
All right. No fingerprints, so gloves on.

15:01.475 --> 15:03.276
Damn it! Never mind. Let's just go.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.181
- What am I looking for?
- Evidence.

15:08.215 --> 15:11.718
Something to prove Dale is
behind the plot to take down KT.

15:11.752 --> 15:14.487
Or advance info.
If outing Whopper was step three,

15:14.522 --> 15:16.122
what are four and five?

15:16.157 --> 15:18.491
We need to prepare to
fend off the next attack.

15:20.194 --> 15:21.661
Well, there's this.

15:21.696 --> 15:23.863
Dale's Omega Chi pledge book.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.668
Holy serial killer.

15:28.703 --> 15:31.071
"J.P., allergic to peppers,
both red and green,

15:31.105 --> 15:34.240
- but strangely fine with jalapenos."
- That is so scary.

15:34.275 --> 15:37.143
Except I know that Cappie hates
all mushrooms except portabellas.

15:37.178 --> 15:39.148
I'm also a recent fan of shitakes.

15:40.514 --> 15:42.549
Look at this.

15:42.583 --> 15:44.985
"Omega Chi/Gamma Psi Winter Formal"?

15:46.087 --> 15:48.722
"Make 100 copies." Yeah, tell me about it.

15:48.756 --> 15:50.457
They could of just scanned
it and emailed it.

15:50.491 --> 15:53.827
No, Omega Chi always does
their Winter Formal with ZBZ.

15:53.861 --> 15:55.295
Now they're doing it with Gamma Psi?

15:55.329 --> 15:58.898
Looks like Omega Chi's not
just out to destroy KT.

15:58.933 --> 16:01.401
They're also trying to screw over ZBZ.

16:01.435 --> 16:04.871
Oh, my God. This could go all
the way to the White House.

16:04.905 --> 16:07.974
- Huh?
- It's big.

16:10.044 --> 16:11.581
You know, um, Clarissa Hawn,

16:11.582 --> 16:13.613
right? I'm sure you've seen her around.

16:13.648 --> 16:15.749
- Professor Land?
- Ah, yes, Professor Land,

16:15.783 --> 16:17.275
where we smoke pipes and wear

16:17.276 --> 16:19.953
tweed and discuss the
existential issues of the day.

16:19.987 --> 16:22.622
Existential. Right.

16:22.657 --> 16:26.726
Anyway, she has this great idea,
marketing to college students,

16:26.761 --> 16:28.828
but she's just going about it all wrong.

16:28.863 --> 16:32.065
I mean, who's been to a rave since 1994?

16:32.099 --> 16:33.325
Well, if she doesn't know what she's doing,

16:33.326 --> 16:34.067
then don't worry about it.

16:34.101 --> 16:36.269
Doesn't seem right for you. Ah!

16:36.303 --> 16:40.373
Uh, sugar-free, non-fat,
iced-blended, well-blended.

16:40.408 --> 16:42.842
- Yeah. Thanks.
- You. Yeah.

16:42.877 --> 16:46.379
I can't rely afford to buy
myself fancy coffee right now.

16:46.414 --> 16:50.050
I know. And that's why I also,

16:50.084 --> 16:55.255
- uh, paid your Dobler's bill.
- What? That was like $300.

16:55.289 --> 16:58.692
Well, I have the cash, and I
like to help you. So let me.

16:58.726 --> 17:02.095
Wow. OK. Thank you.

17:02.129 --> 17:04.097
Good. Now that that's settled,
there's something else.

17:04.131 --> 17:07.233
There is a donor dinner tomorrow
night at Prospect House.

17:07.268 --> 17:08.953
In Professor Land?

17:08.954 --> 17:10.432
A bunch of bigwig alums, one of whom

17:10.433 --> 17:12.638
is interested in hiring
me for my legal services.

17:12.673 --> 17:16.276
- OK.
- I'd, uh, love to have you on my arm.

17:16.310 --> 17:19.345
Wow. That sounds awesome.

17:19.380 --> 17:22.515
Very grown up, serious.

17:22.550 --> 17:25.351
I'm not sure I have anything
grown-up, serious to wear.

17:25.386 --> 17:27.987
- Well, take my credit card.
- No, that's not what I meant.

17:28.021 --> 17:29.622
Look, I know. I just...

17:29.657 --> 17:33.960
It makes me happy to see you happy. So...

17:33.994 --> 17:35.095
just take it.

17:43.137 --> 17:45.338
Hey. What's up, Rebecca?

17:45.372 --> 17:47.140
If you're looking for
Casey, she's not here.

17:47.174 --> 17:48.975
Actually, I need to talk to you.

17:50.644 --> 17:51.911
There's probably no way
to actually destroy it.

17:51.946 --> 17:53.646
It is a diamond, after all,

17:53.681 --> 17:54.814
the hardest substance found in nature.

17:54.849 --> 17:56.282
Even harder than Evan's heart.

17:56.317 --> 17:59.152
I don't wanna make things worse, but, uh...

17:59.186 --> 18:01.026
I'll just actually take...

18:01.027 --> 18:03.857
take that from you and put it over here.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.559
Uh, Omega Chi

18:06.594 --> 18:09.229
is gonna do their Winter
Formal with Gamma Psi.

18:09.263 --> 18:11.998
Are you frickin' kidding me?
This has to be Evan.

18:12.032 --> 18:13.430
He's pissed about our breakup,

18:13.431 --> 18:15.668
and he's using his fraternity
to get back at me.

18:15.703 --> 18:16.716
I think it's bigger than that.

18:16.717 --> 18:18.271
They're already trying
to take Kappa Tau down.

18:18.305 --> 18:19.773
I think your house is next,

18:19.807 --> 18:22.242
and they're replacing you with Gamma Psi.

18:22.276 --> 18:24.577
They've even got Dale dating Natalie.

18:26.580 --> 18:29.783
That little munchkin slept
with a judge to win Song Fest.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.619
She's not gonna win this.
I'm gonna nip her in the bud.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.721
This is Rebecca Logan's ZBZ.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.468
You better watch out.

18:48.502 --> 18:51.237
Because we are so ready, we're
like 22-year-old virgins.

18:51.272 --> 18:55.008
- And having been one, I should know.
- Yes. Well, us, too.

18:55.042 --> 18:57.977
I mean about the case.
I mean, 'cause Jan wasn't my first.

18:58.012 --> 19:01.447
- I mean, that's... What'd she tell you?
- Everything.

19:01.482 --> 19:04.150
- Hello, Jan. - I'm glad to hear
you're all chomping at the bit.

19:04.185 --> 19:06.055
Mock Trial begins tomorrow.

19:06.056 --> 19:08.688
You all ready to argue your asses off?

19:08.722 --> 19:09.956
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

19:09.990 --> 19:11.591
Good. Then how 'bout this?

19:11.625 --> 19:13.860
Your teams will now switch sides.

19:13.894 --> 19:16.863
- What? - Casey and Katherine
will argue on behalf of Evil Corp.

19:16.897 --> 19:19.332
Evan and Jim for Mom and Pop Puppy Shop.

19:19.366 --> 19:21.301
But I would never defend Evil Corp.

19:21.335 --> 19:22.869
Watch what you say, Ms.
Cartwright, especially when

19:22.903 --> 19:24.437
- potential employers are listening.
- But...

19:24.471 --> 19:26.606
The law is an objective profession.

19:26.640 --> 19:29.475
My job is to strip away lifetime
of unexamined bias and morality.

19:29.510 --> 19:32.078
- But... - I think we should start
with the corporate legalities.

19:32.112 --> 19:33.421
Why are you not freaking out?

19:33.422 --> 19:35.048
Not only are we defending the devil,

19:35.082 --> 19:36.482
but we are completely unprepared.

19:36.517 --> 19:38.518
I told Evan about the
First Amendment angle.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.653
That's what he's going to use
now that we've switched sides!

19:40.688 --> 19:42.755
So we know exactly which
argument to prepare for.

19:42.790 --> 19:45.391
But we spent all day preparing
for eminent domain.

19:45.426 --> 19:48.761
- We are totally screwed!
- Get it together, woman!

19:50.497 --> 19:52.332
You just... You just slapped me.

19:52.366 --> 19:53.585
I didn't know what else to do.

19:53.586 --> 19:55.902
But if you just follow my lead
and do exactly what I say,

19:55.936 --> 19:58.471
we can do this, Casey.

20:03.481 --> 20:06.450
Buying a dress for my grown up,
serious date is way more fun

20:06.484 --> 20:07.943
than meeting with crazy Clarissa.

20:07.944 --> 20:10.311
So I rescheduled, I told her I
needed emergency dental surgery.

20:10.345 --> 20:12.041
Psychological manipulation

20:12.042 --> 20:14.782
combined with victim playing. Nicely done.

20:15.811 --> 20:19.180
Ooh! And all rise.

20:19.214 --> 20:20.818
Does this say "Shark" To you?

20:21.376 --> 20:24.111
- Werewolf, actually.
- OK.

20:25.580 --> 20:28.316
That's a little too grown up, serious.

20:28.350 --> 20:30.751
Well, I want Simon's
colleagues to respect me.

20:30.786 --> 20:33.487
I think you can do that without
looking like a Republican.

20:33.522 --> 20:37.258
And, oh, my God, I'm giving you
advice on dating my professor.

20:37.292 --> 20:40.428
Well, I'm sorry that that's
still weird for you.

20:40.462 --> 20:41.919
Well, as long as you continue to

20:41.920 --> 20:44.198
make him very happy until
the end of the semester,

20:44.232 --> 20:46.267
- I can't complain.
- So you're whoring me out?

20:46.301 --> 20:48.035
Kinda.

20:48.070 --> 20:48.646
Speaking of whores,

20:48.647 --> 20:51.639
I feel like one having
to argue for Evil Corp.

20:51.673 --> 20:55.209
Yeah, but look at you.
You're a pretty, classy whore.

20:57.312 --> 20:59.547
- OK.
- Oh! Very nice.

20:59.581 --> 21:00.921
Very Democratic.

21:00.922 --> 21:04.418
There's just no way the
university can accept money

21:04.453 --> 21:07.088
from a corporation without
feeling beholden to them.

21:07.122 --> 21:09.156
It affects its behavior, its decisions.

21:09.191 --> 21:12.493
Well, not necessarily.
I mean, it's possible for the university

21:12.527 --> 21:16.297
to accept a very generous donation
and still keep its integrity.

21:16.331 --> 21:18.199
Please. It's a transaction.

21:18.233 --> 21:20.701
You give money, you expect
something in return.

21:20.736 --> 21:24.415
But maybe the corporation really does have

21:24.416 --> 21:26.073
the university's best interests at heart.

21:26.108 --> 21:27.207
Maybe this expansion is

21:27.208 --> 21:29.310
the best thing that's
ever happened to them.

21:29.344 --> 21:32.513
Oh. Sure.

21:32.547 --> 21:35.049
Life is just so much easier with money.

21:35.083 --> 21:39.153
And someone giving you that money
is the easiest way to get it.

21:51.066 --> 21:54.402
Rebecca. What brings you
to the new Gamma Psi?

21:54.436 --> 21:56.904
Hey, Nat, wanna see the new tail wiggle?

21:56.938 --> 21:59.240
Oh! So bad! Just gimme a sec.

21:59.274 --> 22:01.208
Love what you've done with the place.

22:01.243 --> 22:03.844
The future of sororities.
Wireless everything,

22:03.879 --> 22:06.213
surround sound in the ceiling.

22:06.248 --> 22:09.016
Nice.

22:09.051 --> 22:11.285
If you're into that Thai bathhouse vibe.

22:11.319 --> 22:14.755
You here to get intel on our
skit for the Pledge Talent Show?

22:14.790 --> 22:17.224
Please, your portly pledges
do the same thing every year.

22:17.259 --> 22:18.793
Brownies!

22:21.596 --> 22:23.072
You better tell them to lay off the carbs

22:23.073 --> 22:24.465
if you wanna impress Omega Chi.

22:24.499 --> 22:25.750
They might be into munchkins,

22:25.751 --> 22:27.735
but they're definitely
not into Oompa-Loompas.

22:27.769 --> 22:30.738
That's right. I know all about
you snaking our Winter Formal.

22:30.772 --> 22:33.541
Super bummed we stole the number
one fraternity from you girls?

22:33.575 --> 22:34.820
Maybe you can have your Winter

22:34.821 --> 22:37.144
Formal with the Tri Pis.
You were a lesbian once, right?

22:37.179 --> 22:38.257
What good is a Winter Formal

22:38.258 --> 22:39.914
with Omega Chi if you have to go with Dale?

22:39.948 --> 22:43.451
- He won't be an Omega Chi by then.
- Excuse me?

22:43.485 --> 22:45.953
I've said too much already.

22:48.523 --> 22:50.491
You better tell me what's going on.

22:50.525 --> 22:53.761
All this new electrical work
can be extremely flammable.

22:53.795 --> 22:57.231
I burned your house down
once, I'll do it again.

22:59.935 --> 23:04.538
I would like to call Mr.
Edgar Schmock, CEO of Evil Corp.

23:04.573 --> 23:06.941
Which is, in fact, not evil,

23:06.975 --> 23:09.944
but is as un-evil as a corporation can get.

23:09.978 --> 23:13.814
- So Mr. Schmock...
- I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth

23:13.849 --> 23:16.283
and nothing but the truth. So help me God.

23:16.318 --> 23:17.382
We're not really doing that,

23:17.383 --> 23:19.320
but thanks to the drama
club for its participation.

23:19.354 --> 23:21.717
So Mr. Schmock, can you tell us,

23:21.718 --> 23:25.150
when you gave your very
charitable donation to H.U.,

23:25.151 --> 23:28.177
did you place any demands or
restrictions on the university?

23:28.178 --> 23:31.246
- No. - No limits on the research
the university might do,

23:31.281 --> 23:33.696
including research into your own,

23:33.697 --> 23:36.185
sometimes controversial, products?

23:36.219 --> 23:40.122
Absolutely not! Did that sound too arch?

23:40.156 --> 23:43.659
It's tough to know the line.
The back story I invented...

23:43.693 --> 23:45.446
OK, So Mr.
Schmock, you would say then, to me,

23:45.447 --> 23:47.129
that there were no strings

23:47.163 --> 23:48.797
placed on this money, wouldn't you?

23:48.832 --> 23:53.535
Well, of course there are gonna be strings.

23:53.570 --> 23:56.805
I mean, yeah, I'm gonna
wanna have some influence.

23:56.840 --> 23:58.579
No, OK, you're supposed to say no.

23:58.580 --> 23:59.775
Except I'm saying yes.

23:59.809 --> 24:01.477
- So say no.
- I say yes!

24:01.511 --> 24:02.611
- No!
- Yes!

24:02.645 --> 24:05.647
- No! No!
- Yes! Yes!

24:05.682 --> 24:06.949
- Liar!
- Yes!

24:06.983 --> 24:10.285
Objection! Badgering the witness.

24:10.320 --> 24:11.687
That's your own team.

24:12.370 --> 24:15.288
- Well, don't you wanna object?
- Do you wanna object?

24:15.289 --> 24:17.490
- I'm fine.
- I'm also fine.

24:17.525 --> 24:20.226
- We're good.
- Moving on. OK, just moving on.

24:20.261 --> 24:22.862
Move on. Move on.
Except I wanna go back to the first one,

24:22.897 --> 24:24.631
'cause you didn't answer it quite
the way I thought you were...

24:24.665 --> 24:27.100
- Can we have a moment?
- I think you probably should.

24:27.134 --> 24:29.335
OK, Casey, it is all about preparation.

24:29.370 --> 24:31.804
And my entire preparation for
the examination of this witness

24:31.839 --> 24:33.340
depended on him answering one way,

24:33.341 --> 24:34.974
but he's saying exactly the opposite.

24:35.009 --> 24:37.610
But this is what you have to
do if you want to be a lawyer.

24:37.645 --> 24:39.061
You do want to be a lawyer, don't you?

24:39.062 --> 24:40.613
I want to be a CEO.

24:40.648 --> 24:41.744
I want to relax in my cushy,

24:41.745 --> 24:44.017
little corner office with my
feetsies hanging over my desk

24:44.051 --> 24:44.762
while I try to convince

24:44.763 --> 24:46.186
myself I'm this generation's
Melanie Griffith,

24:46.220 --> 24:48.655
despite my clear resemblance
to Sigourney Weaver due to our

24:48.689 --> 24:50.290
- extreme stature and height.
- OK!

24:50.324 --> 24:51.824
Don't slap me!

24:51.859 --> 24:53.626
Are they talking about Sigourney Weaver?

24:53.661 --> 24:55.495
I don't know. I don't get it.

24:55.529 --> 24:57.363
- This is a disaster.
- You have to take over.

24:57.398 --> 25:00.166
Casey, you have to do this.

25:01.735 --> 25:02.835
Miss Cartwright?

25:06.640 --> 25:09.301
So, what do you think?
The coconuts are itchy,

25:09.302 --> 25:11.094
but these cantaloupes are kinda huge.

25:11.095 --> 25:12.645
I gotta go with the coconuts.

25:12.680 --> 25:15.715
- Cantaloupes are out of season anyway.
- Nice melons.

25:15.749 --> 25:18.318
Uh, I was just upstairs
with Heath studying.

25:18.352 --> 25:20.186
I mean, I guess that's all I
can do for you at this point.

25:20.221 --> 25:22.922
Thanks, I guess. Without the Whopper,

25:22.957 --> 25:24.991
who knows if it'll ever be enough.

25:27.094 --> 25:29.458
- Never trust little people!
- What did you find out?

25:29.459 --> 25:30.930
Is it Omega Chi screwing us over?

25:30.965 --> 25:33.099
I have no idea, but they're
definitely messing with Dale.

25:33.133 --> 25:34.732
What are you talking about?

25:34.733 --> 25:37.270
His bid, his being a pledge?
It's all a lie.

25:37.304 --> 25:39.205
Trip and your brothers are hazing him hard,

25:39.240 --> 25:41.173
humiliating him any way possible

25:41.174 --> 25:43.042
to get back at you for spring break.

25:43.077 --> 25:44.344
They were never gonna initiate him.

25:44.378 --> 25:46.012
This is what I was afraid of all along.

25:46.046 --> 25:49.282
And that gnome is in on it.
She pretends to date Dale,

25:49.316 --> 25:52.385
in exchange, Gamma Psi gets its
Winter Formal with Omega Chi.

25:53.487 --> 25:55.388
I had no idea about any of this, I swear.

25:55.422 --> 25:58.057
Now, Dale's gonna go embarrass
himself at the Pledge Talent Show.

25:58.092 --> 26:00.393
Natalie doesn't know how, or
what the Omega Chis are doing,

26:00.427 --> 26:03.062
but Trip told her it'll be huge.
Like her ass!

26:03.097 --> 26:04.179
We have to do something.

26:04.180 --> 26:06.155
Are you just gonna stand
by while your brothers

26:06.156 --> 26:09.535
go behind your back and
humiliate Dale like this?

26:12.106 --> 26:14.474
I'm ready for the Talent Show.
You guys coming?

26:15.854 --> 26:16.993
Let's go save Dale.

26:23.626 --> 26:25.027
Where the hell is the water fountain?

26:25.061 --> 26:26.795
There's always a water
fountain in the movies!

26:26.830 --> 26:30.432
- Take a deep breath, counselor.
- Screw you.

26:30.467 --> 26:33.101
I'm going back in there,
and I'm gonna kill.

26:33.136 --> 26:35.270
I'm gonna argue for something
I don't believe in,

26:35.305 --> 26:36.770
and beat up some poor old man

26:36.771 --> 26:40.609
who owns a puppy shop.
Because I am a plagio...

26:42.812 --> 26:45.814
- I am a shark!
- Yeah. Keep telling yourself that.

26:45.849 --> 26:47.916
Of course it's easy for you,

26:47.951 --> 26:49.918
who seems to have lost
all sense of loyalty.

26:49.953 --> 26:52.020
I can't believe what law
school's done to you.

26:52.055 --> 26:54.323
It's more like what Casey
Cartwright's done to me.

26:54.357 --> 26:56.291
Rebecca is the one who broke up with you.

26:56.326 --> 26:57.626
I don't know why you're so pissed at me.

26:57.660 --> 27:01.363
Because you took it all away!
Look, I couldn't have you,

27:01.397 --> 27:02.631
then you made it so I
couldn't have Rebecca.

27:02.665 --> 27:05.467
And I'm not even supposed
to be a little pissed?

27:05.502 --> 27:08.237
I didn't take those things from you, Evan.
You made choices.

27:08.271 --> 27:10.038
But don't you ever think about it?

27:11.741 --> 27:14.209
What if?

27:14.244 --> 27:15.470
Four years ago,

27:15.471 --> 27:18.280
I thought we'd be in law
school together as a couple.

27:18.314 --> 27:20.415
That was a long time ago.

27:20.450 --> 27:23.318
But what if we were
supposed to be together?

27:26.422 --> 27:29.458
What if, all along,

27:29.492 --> 27:31.860
it was supposed to be you and me?

27:36.065 --> 27:38.500
Of course I've thought about it.

27:38.535 --> 27:40.302
I don't know.

27:40.336 --> 27:45.340
Maybe I am making a big
mistake with Cappie.

27:49.879 --> 27:54.483
Oh! You're so easy.

27:54.517 --> 27:56.585
Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice,

27:56.586 --> 27:58.654
I don't have any business being a lawyer.

27:58.688 --> 27:59.988
Nice try, counselor.

28:42.031 --> 28:44.533
- Hey! Dale!
- You cannot go out there.

28:44.567 --> 28:46.868
Please, a performer prepares.
I need my space.

28:46.903 --> 28:49.571
Trip and some of those guys,
they're screwing with you!

28:49.606 --> 28:51.540
- Uh, yeah, it's called hazing.
- No, it's more than that.

28:51.574 --> 28:54.076
They want you to drop out, but
not before they've had a chance

28:54.110 --> 28:56.265
to humiliate you as much as possible.

28:56.266 --> 28:57.112
How do you know that?

28:57.146 --> 28:59.314
Natalie told Rebecca,

28:59.349 --> 29:01.398
who is the world's weirdest Dale defender,

29:01.399 --> 29:02.618
but I still believer her.

29:02.652 --> 29:06.355
I'm sorry. I had no idea.
I'm embarrassed for the house.

29:09.759 --> 29:12.661
I don't believe it.
You proved yourself a traitor anyway.

29:12.695 --> 29:15.397
And you can't handle that I'm an Omega Chi.
You're jealous.

29:15.431 --> 29:17.599
Dale, come on.
We can't do the show without you.

29:19.936 --> 29:21.436
I'm going with my brothers.

29:26.909 --> 29:29.044
Oh...

29:37.654 --> 29:38.854
What's that about?

29:39.856 --> 29:41.990
OK, come on, let's do this.

29:42.025 --> 29:47.129
Tell me, why do you want
to work for the CIA?

29:47.163 --> 29:48.463
They just come out and ask that?

29:48.498 --> 29:49.965
It's kind of interview question 101.

29:49.999 --> 29:52.334
Then they're gonna ask what your
three greatest weaknesses are,

29:52.368 --> 29:55.904
and you'll tell them that you
care too much, work too hard

29:55.938 --> 29:58.006
and that you do too good
of a job on most things.

29:58.041 --> 29:59.380
Those are my weaknesses.

29:59.381 --> 30:01.677
Hey, did you get together with Clarissa?

30:01.711 --> 30:03.779
No. Simon says not to worry about that.

30:03.813 --> 30:06.982
Did you know that he has
a house on Nantucket?

30:07.016 --> 30:09.418
Simon says the summers there are amazing.

30:09.452 --> 30:12.988
Wow. That's, uh...

30:13.022 --> 30:16.324
- He has a daughter.
- I know. What's wrong with that?

30:16.359 --> 30:17.400
It's instant family.

30:17.401 --> 30:20.028
I could totally see myself
as a professor's wife,

30:20.063 --> 30:23.131
hosting cocktail parties
for Sy's proteges. Oh!

30:23.166 --> 30:25.175
We could have a wedding on the beach.

30:25.176 --> 30:26.968
It'd be like a Taylor Swift song.

30:27.003 --> 30:30.772
Totally. And what does Simon
say about what Ashleigh says?

30:30.807 --> 30:34.876
Won't it be a hard commute from
Nantucket to your marketing job?

30:34.911 --> 30:35.946
Maybe I won't be working.

30:35.947 --> 30:37.613
Maybe I'll just have a bunch of babies.

30:37.614 --> 30:40.300
And then I'll hire an au pair
to do all the hard parts.

30:40.301 --> 30:43.637
If that's what you want. But is he the guy

30:43.671 --> 30:45.272
you're willing to give up everything for?

30:45.306 --> 30:49.810
Or are you just making him
that guy because it's easy,

30:49.844 --> 30:52.713
and everything else right now seems hard?

30:54.782 --> 30:55.974
Simon's great.

30:56.644 --> 30:59.345
He bought me a dress, he
paid that Dobler's bill,

30:59.380 --> 31:01.281
- invited me to this dinner.
- I know.

31:01.315 --> 31:02.285
I just wanna make sure

31:02.286 --> 31:04.484
what he wants in return is
what Ashleigh wants, too.

31:04.518 --> 31:07.687
And court is now in session.

31:08.555 --> 31:10.885
Isn't it true that Mom-and-Pop

31:10.886 --> 31:13.993
Puppies has been losing money for years?

31:14.027 --> 31:17.404
You can't put a monetary value on
the pleasures our puppies give.

31:17.405 --> 31:19.039
Get him, Casey!

31:21.343 --> 31:24.304
Which explains why you've
had to file for bankruptcy

31:24.305 --> 31:25.672
on several occasions.

31:25.706 --> 31:28.274
Isn't it also true that your
building is falling apart,

31:28.309 --> 31:30.009
mired with housing violations?

31:30.044 --> 31:31.978
We have had to do a lot of repairs, but...

31:32.012 --> 31:34.724
So it's really a miracle, don't you think,

31:34.725 --> 31:37.178
that H.U. offered as much
as they did to buy you out?

31:37.179 --> 31:40.981
- I suppose it was a generous offer.
- Very generous.

31:41.016 --> 31:43.207
Especially since your building
is considered an eyesore

31:43.208 --> 31:44.818
and a blight on the community.

31:44.853 --> 31:48.889
- I built that store myself.
- Can't you at least admit

31:48.924 --> 31:52.148
that Mom-and-Pop is more of a
puppy mill than a puppy store?

31:52.149 --> 31:54.350
I love those animals, every one...

31:54.385 --> 31:56.486
I think it's time that you
take responsibility, Pop,

31:56.520 --> 31:59.789
and stop hiding behind these
tortured, innocent animals!

32:06.764 --> 32:08.598
No further questions.

32:09.224 --> 32:10.660
I'll mop up the blood for ya.

32:10.661 --> 32:12.514
- I'm just doing my job.
- But when I do it,

32:12.515 --> 32:14.571
I'm just an ass who's lost his way?

32:27.051 --> 32:32.455
- I call Casey Cartwright.
- She's not on the witness list.

32:32.489 --> 32:35.358
But there's been a new development
that needs to come to light.

32:35.392 --> 32:38.061
Really? All right.

32:38.733 --> 32:41.668
- Fair enough.
- This is gonna be awesome.

32:46.174 --> 32:48.954
Ms. Cartwright, do you recall a
conversation you had with me

32:48.955 --> 32:50.344
in the law lounge two nights ago?

32:50.378 --> 32:53.247
- Don't do this.
- Answer the question, please.

32:54.949 --> 32:57.225
- Yes.
- Isn't it true that you told me information

32:57.226 --> 32:59.630
about a conversation you
had with your client,

32:59.631 --> 33:01.094
a confidential conversation,

33:01.129 --> 33:03.263
thereby breaching
attorney-client privilege,

33:03.298 --> 33:06.099
not to mention revealing
strategy to opposing counsel?

33:06.134 --> 33:07.968
Objection!

33:08.002 --> 33:10.237
No, I can handle this.

33:11.606 --> 33:15.108
Um, that is correct, Mr. Chambers.

33:21.783 --> 33:22.883
Thanks, man.

34:22.210 --> 34:24.578
What the hell?

34:24.612 --> 34:26.947
- Gimme that.
- Come and get it!

34:26.981 --> 34:29.917
Oh, my God, what a loser!

34:29.951 --> 34:32.753
- What'd you say, bitch?
- Get off the stage!

34:32.786 --> 34:38.058
Just go!

34:40.561 --> 34:43.297
No! I'm gonna finish the song.

34:43.331 --> 34:45.831
Is this what you want?

34:45.867 --> 34:49.202
Is this what you call brotherhood?

35:04.986 --> 35:07.120
Hey, guys, look at us!

35:23.044 --> 35:25.455
*** wed for what you did. SOPHIE?

35:25.456 --> 35:27.030
You'd definitely be removed from the case.

35:27.031 --> 35:28.791
- I know, but I was just...
- There's not a lot of room

35:28.792 --> 35:30.036
for sympathy in the legal profession.

35:30.037 --> 35:31.943
Every case is a competition.

35:31.944 --> 35:34.626
And if you wanna keep your
clients, you better wanna win.

35:34.627 --> 35:37.172
- I do. Trust me. I really do.
- Then show me.

35:37.501 --> 35:39.669
Here's your closing argument.

35:46.644 --> 35:51.081
I may have made an error in judgment,

35:52.016 --> 35:54.139
but the facts of this case remain the same.

35:54.140 --> 35:58.804
It is possible to accept a
donation, and not sell your soul.

35:58.805 --> 36:00.651
H.U. Has the ability to

36:00.652 --> 36:03.835
resist feelings of obligation
towards its donors.

36:03.836 --> 36:05.544
To pick and choose the money

36:05.545 --> 36:07.552
it accepts would amount to discrimination,

36:07.553 --> 36:09.969
and would lead to nothing more than less:

36:09.970 --> 36:12.636
Less advancement, less growth.

36:13.237 --> 36:15.305
And that benefits no one.

36:16.607 --> 36:21.894
Mom-and-Pop may be a
casualty of that growth,

36:21.895 --> 36:25.015
but every decision has consequences.

36:29.253 --> 36:31.223
We're talking about the greater good.

36:31.224 --> 36:36.316
As such, there is no slippery
slope with Evil Corp.

36:36.317 --> 36:39.396
There is only opportunity.

36:54.312 --> 36:55.520
That was awesome, Kettlewell.

36:55.521 --> 36:56.985
So you've been messing
with me the whole time?

36:58.377 --> 37:01.121
I can't believe you really thought
you could be an Omega Chi.

37:01.122 --> 37:02.554
You're Rusty Cartwright's roommate.

37:02.555 --> 37:04.538
Why do you think we bid
you in the first place?

37:04.539 --> 37:07.330
So it was just an elaborate
scheme to get back at KT?

37:07.331 --> 37:10.187
You out their rush party,
their philanthropy,

37:10.188 --> 37:12.415
Joshua Whopper, and then fake haze me?

37:12.416 --> 37:14.812
No idea about those first three, but yeah,

37:14.813 --> 37:17.037
we've definitely been faking it with you.

37:18.306 --> 37:19.806
Just like we got Natalie to.

37:22.431 --> 37:26.079
For an engineering major,
you're pretty stupid.

37:36.858 --> 37:39.993
- Get the hell out of here!
- Get out of here, loser!

37:42.363 --> 37:44.362
I'd like to congratulate both teams.

37:44.363 --> 37:48.067
You've had a taste of real
world stakes and tactics.

37:48.068 --> 37:50.837
Of course, in the real world,
there's always a judgment,

37:51.239 --> 37:53.006
so I rule for...

37:53.641 --> 37:55.409
Evil Corp.

37:56.944 --> 37:59.183
Despite the violation,

37:59.184 --> 38:01.684
I believe that Ms.
Cartwright gave a great argument.

38:01.685 --> 38:04.151
So thank you, all. Court is adjourned.

38:07.355 --> 38:10.155
- Oh!
- Ms. Cartwright. Great work.

38:10.156 --> 38:11.984
Well, feels a little hollow.

38:12.427 --> 38:14.160
I said a lot of things I don't believe.

38:14.161 --> 38:15.889
That's what'll make you a great lawyer.

38:15.890 --> 38:18.832
By the way, that research position?
It's yours.

38:19.267 --> 38:21.168
If you want it.

38:23.037 --> 38:25.179
- You were amazing.
- Oh!

38:25.180 --> 38:28.469
- So beyond.
- Thanks, guys.

38:28.470 --> 38:31.637
Listen, I gotta bail because I
gotta go to that "Interview."

38:31.638 --> 38:34.935
- Mmm. Sexy.
- Maybe later I'll give you an aptitude test.

38:35.349 --> 38:38.451
OK, ew. I'm gonna go talk to Sy.

38:38.553 --> 38:40.935
Oh, wait. But who am I
going to celebrate with?

38:40.936 --> 38:43.955
OK, let me ask, maybe we can
grab a drink before dinner.

38:43.956 --> 38:45.392
- OK.
- OK.

38:49.097 --> 38:51.427
Congratulations. I'm sure the fact that

38:51.428 --> 38:53.600
he's dating your best friend didn't hurt.

38:54.635 --> 38:56.436
Unbelievable.

39:07.181 --> 39:09.816
- Hey. That was so awesome!
- Hey.

39:10.618 --> 39:14.225
Mmm! It was like Law and Order: CRU.

39:14.226 --> 39:16.471
Well, it was nice to have you here.

39:16.472 --> 39:19.174
It was nice to be here. So, um, listen,

39:19.175 --> 39:22.334
Casey is really excited and
she wants to go celebrate,

39:22.335 --> 39:25.270
and her boyfriend's got this
interview with the CIA, so

39:25.271 --> 39:28.621
I was wondering if I could meet
you later at the donor dinner.

39:28.622 --> 39:31.671
No.

39:32.773 --> 39:35.627
Well, it's just, it's a really
important day for Casey.

39:35.628 --> 39:37.591
It's an important night for me.
You said you'd be there.

39:37.592 --> 39:39.319
Yeah, and I will. I'm sure

39:39.320 --> 39:41.189
you can handle a cocktail hour on your own.

39:41.190 --> 39:44.525
I don't want to.
Why do you think I bought you the dress?

39:44.526 --> 39:47.362
- I'm sorry, what?
- I pay your Dobler's bill,

39:47.363 --> 39:49.973
I buy you a dress, I expect you to show up.

39:49.974 --> 39:53.627
- Because it's a transaction?
- No, Ashleigh...

39:54.896 --> 39:59.839
There are things that we both
contribute to the relationship.

39:59.840 --> 40:03.098
Oh, I get it. Like, you contribute money

40:03.099 --> 40:05.209
and I have to live with the strings,

40:05.210 --> 40:07.409
which are basically you
telling me where to be when.

40:07.410 --> 40:11.011
I just... I was really
looking forward to tonight.

40:12.880 --> 40:15.649
Why don't we just forget
this ever happened.

40:22.356 --> 40:23.690
Wow.

40:24.525 --> 40:28.016
The hidden cameras are so... hidden.

40:28.017 --> 40:32.192
Or is there a miniature
recording device in that pen?

40:32.193 --> 40:34.167
Don't worry. Once you're hired,

40:34.936 --> 40:37.850
we tell you all about who shot JFK,

40:37.851 --> 40:40.280
how we faked the moon landing

40:40.281 --> 40:42.876
and what we're hiding in Area 51.

40:43.377 --> 40:45.076
- Really?
- No.

40:45.446 --> 40:49.015
- Oh.
- Just a little Company humor.

40:49.350 --> 40:50.750
Ah.

40:51.652 --> 40:53.753
You're an unusual candidate for the agency.

40:54.622 --> 40:57.898
- Obviously, very bright.
- Yes, I am.

40:57.899 --> 41:02.810
So, um, I assume you haven't spoken

41:02.811 --> 41:06.833
to anyone about this opportunity?

41:07.768 --> 41:11.705
Uh... no.

41:12.840 --> 41:14.608
No one.

41:16.944 --> 41:17.978
Except for my girlfriend.

41:18.846 --> 41:21.760
But she's a lawyer, practically. So...

41:21.761 --> 41:23.923
And her best friend, Ashleigh.

41:23.924 --> 41:26.667
And the House...
But, I mean, we're a fraternity.

41:26.668 --> 41:29.125
So we're really good at keeping secrets.

41:29.126 --> 41:33.845
Except for Rusty, he told
Dale about Joshua Whopper.

41:34.061 --> 41:36.796
But then again, I just told you, too.

41:37.064 --> 41:37.831
Uh-oh.

41:39.200 --> 41:43.303
But you don't even know what Joshua
Whopper is, so it doesn't...

41:45.006 --> 41:48.642
- Yeah.
- I think we're done here.

42:12.997 --> 42:13.668
Hey.

42:14.535 --> 42:17.575
Well, I guess the whole school's
pretty much seen us naked now.

42:17.576 --> 42:19.335
It's kinda nice to have it out of the way.

42:19.507 --> 42:21.588
I can't believe I ever fell
for that fraternity crap.

42:21.589 --> 42:22.621
Well, not all fraternities are crap.

42:22.622 --> 42:24.442
Just some of the people in them.

42:24.443 --> 42:27.847
Oh. Believing that is like
worshipping a false god.

42:29.250 --> 42:30.483
No, brotherhood is real.

42:31.686 --> 42:34.745
You realize that more when you're
coming close to losing it.

42:34.746 --> 42:38.008
Considering how much trouble
our house is in right now.

42:38.009 --> 42:40.178
We still don't know who's screwing with us.

42:40.179 --> 42:41.899
I can't believe you
thought I would do that.

42:41.900 --> 42:45.006
Well, you did try to shut down
the Greek system with U-SAG.

42:45.007 --> 42:46.966
That's true.

42:50.338 --> 42:52.772
- Going out?
- No.

42:53.307 --> 42:54.541
Simon and I broke up.

42:55.323 --> 42:57.157
But I'm keeping this dress.

42:58.593 --> 43:01.435
- Wanna watch The Bachelor?
- No.

43:03.779 --> 43:04.931
I can't stay up too late, though.

43:04.932 --> 43:07.599
'Cause I'm meeting
Clarissa tomorrow at nine.

43:08.435 --> 43:12.433
Time to be grown up, serious. For reals.
