WEBVTT

00:00.898 --> 00:03.599
All right, send them in.

00:09.073 --> 00:10.740
Now, is there anyone

00:10.719 --> 00:12.719
who looks like the person who robbed you?

00:13.298 --> 00:17.884
Well, the one on the left looks familiar.

00:17.887 --> 00:20.804
And I see her every morning.

00:20.806 --> 00:23.891
Anybody else you recognize, ma'am?

00:25.511 --> 00:28.011
Are you sure they can't see us?

00:28.013 --> 00:29.429
No, ma'am. Absolutely not.

00:29.431 --> 00:33.150
Tribeca, Geils, my office now!

00:33.152 --> 00:34.852
Coming, Lieutenant.

00:34.854 --> 00:37.020
And make it snappy!

00:49.168 --> 00:50.284
What's going on?

00:50.286 --> 00:52.753
Grab a seat.

00:52.755 --> 00:55.088
A ventriloquist has been murdered.

00:55.090 --> 00:56.757
Oh, my god. Which one?

00:56.759 --> 00:58.208
- Which one?
- Like, his name?

00:58.210 --> 01:00.761
Who knows the name of any ventriloquist?

01:00.763 --> 01:03.046
Right. Not me. I mean...

01:03.048 --> 01:04.882
Victim's name was Alan Parsons.

01:04.884 --> 01:06.800
Alan Parsons?! Who?

01:06.802 --> 01:08.352
He was an All-American at Syracuse,

01:08.354 --> 01:11.388
and he won ventriloquist
of the year last year.

01:11.390 --> 01:13.690
And the year before.

01:13.692 --> 01:15.943
I think. I mean, who is this guy?

01:15.945 --> 01:17.227
We'll get right on it, Lieutenant.

01:17.229 --> 01:21.315
He saw my face! He saw my face!

01:26.906 --> 01:30.407
We got two bodies a big one and
a small one.

01:32.628 --> 01:34.127
Look at him.

01:34.129 --> 01:36.580
So peaceful.

01:39.301 --> 01:40.834
Whoever did this started with Parsons

01:40.836 --> 01:42.586
and then moved on to Lance the dummy.

01:42.588 --> 01:43.670
They lanced the dummy?

01:43.672 --> 01:45.088
No, no. Lance is the dummy's name.

01:45.090 --> 01:46.423
They just knocked him to the floor.

01:46.425 --> 01:47.724
Parsons was hammered.

01:47.726 --> 01:49.893
- Drunk on the job?
- No. Blunt-force trauma.

01:49.895 --> 01:51.345
We think he was gutted.

01:51.347 --> 01:53.764
- Evisceration?
- No, no. About the performance.

01:53.766 --> 01:55.098
It was a real tough crowd.

01:55.100 --> 01:56.984
Was he close to anyone? Was he married?

01:56.986 --> 01:59.770
Uh, yes, Mr. Parsons was married to a...

02:03.492 --> 02:05.901
Hang on. I have it here.

02:07.696 --> 02:09.913
- Mrs. Parsons.
- Hmm.

02:15.120 --> 02:16.787
Mm.

02:16.789 --> 02:19.423
Looks like the press
is already sniffing around.

02:21.010 --> 02:23.722
Wow, that is a nice house
for a ventriloquist.

02:23.722 --> 02:24.489
Yeah.

02:24.491 --> 02:27.326
I always pictured them
huddled around a trash-can fire

02:27.328 --> 02:28.277
with fingerless gloves.

02:28.279 --> 02:29.611
Are you joking?

02:29.613 --> 02:31.818
These guys talk
without moving their mouths.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.587
I mean, look at my dumb
old mouth moving as I'm talking.

02:34.587 --> 02:36.971
These guys have a gift from god.

02:36.972 --> 02:38.922
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:39.227 --> 02:42.611
If there's something personal
going on with you and this case,

02:42.612 --> 02:44.146
you need to tell me now.

02:44.146 --> 02:46.062
There's nothing going on.

02:46.064 --> 02:49.399
No, not even with a head cock.
There's nothing going on.

02:49.401 --> 02:51.901
Geils, trust me, okay?

02:51.903 --> 02:55.121
You need to let it go,
or it'll eat you alive.

02:55.123 --> 02:57.574
Well, I don't want to talk about it.

02:57.576 --> 02:59.793
But I don't want
to be eaten alive, either.

03:04.548 --> 03:07.345
All right, but if you share this
with a soul,

03:07.345 --> 03:10.379
I'll tell every cop in
the precinct that you're a girl.

03:10.381 --> 03:12.703
You have my word.

03:16.387 --> 03:19.355
I was 12 years old.

03:19.357 --> 03:24.110
But all I could think about
was the time I was 7 years old.

03:24.112 --> 03:25.528
It was my birthday,

03:25.530 --> 03:28.648
and my parents got me a special present.

03:28.650 --> 03:31.567
It was a real humdinger.

03:31.569 --> 03:33.486
It was a ventriloquist dummy,

03:33.488 --> 03:36.823
and everyone knew that Humdinger
made the best ones.

03:36.825 --> 03:38.541
Well, what do you want to do today?

03:38.543 --> 03:40.493
Well, we can go on a water slide.

03:40.495 --> 03:42.411
- I practiced day and night.
- No, I don't want to go on a water slide.

03:42.413 --> 03:43.713
You'll get messed up.

03:43.715 --> 03:47.667
I had ventriloquism posters,
trading cards.

03:47.669 --> 03:49.836
I knew the stats of all the best v-quists.

03:49.838 --> 03:52.221
That's what us insiders called them.

03:52.223 --> 03:55.075
Then came the night of the big talent show.

03:55.075 --> 03:56.574
I was a bundle of nerves.

03:56.576 --> 03:58.743
I knew that the audience
was full of scouts,

03:58.745 --> 04:02.299
so I had to give an
absolutely perfect performance.

04:02.299 --> 04:08.269
Ladies and gentlemen,
our very own Jay Geils.

04:15.761 --> 04:18.310
How you doing today, buddy?

04:18.313 --> 04:21.149
My lawyer says I don't have
to answer that question.

04:21.249 --> 04:24.318
I just couldn't
master not moving my lips.

04:24.776 --> 04:26.872
I told myself it doesn't matter,

04:26.888 --> 04:29.272
but it turns out that's a big part of it.

04:29.274 --> 04:31.732
I never put my hand
inside of anything again.

04:32.890 --> 04:34.423
Mm.

04:34.425 --> 04:35.757
You want a dog?

04:35.759 --> 04:37.009
There's a great place around the corner.

04:37.011 --> 04:39.011
Did you listen to anything I said?

04:39.013 --> 04:42.147
You're humiliated,
and your dreams were crushed.

04:42.149 --> 04:43.649
It happens to the best of us.

04:43.651 --> 04:44.933
You got to move on.

04:46.070 --> 04:48.403
You ever have a dream?

04:57.665 --> 04:59.615
No.

05:09.927 --> 05:11.760
Oh, my god.

05:12.123 --> 05:13.990
Again, Doreen, I'm so sorry,

05:13.992 --> 05:15.408
- and if there's...
- That's Fisher Price,

05:15.410 --> 05:17.460
the world's most famous ventriloquist.

05:17.462 --> 05:18.828
He once did an entire show

05:18.830 --> 05:21.831
with a hornets' nest in his mouth.

05:21.833 --> 05:25.134
Mr. Price, Detective Geils.
It's a great honor.

05:25.136 --> 05:26.836
Pleasure to meet you, Detective.

05:26.838 --> 05:29.171
The pleasure is all mine.

05:31.843 --> 05:33.392
Can I help you?

05:33.394 --> 05:36.846
Hi, Mrs. Parsons.
We are detectives from L.A.P.D.

05:36.848 --> 05:38.147
We're sorry to disturb you

05:38.149 --> 05:40.182
at what must be a very difficult time.

05:40.184 --> 05:41.400
Thank you.

05:41.402 --> 05:43.352
Plus, I don't know if you're aware,

05:43.354 --> 05:44.687
but my husband just died.

05:44.689 --> 05:46.022
Yes. Yes, we heard.

05:46.024 --> 05:47.573
Also, Lance and I were very close,

05:47.575 --> 05:50.526
so I lost my husband
and I lost my best friend.

05:50.528 --> 05:51.827
Lance was your best friend?

05:51.829 --> 05:53.829
No. Lance was my husband's best friend.

05:53.831 --> 05:55.581
My best friend was Rita Zzyzplx.

05:55.583 --> 05:56.583
How do you spell that?

05:56.584 --> 05:57.616
R-i-t-a.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.001
Thank you.

05:59.871 --> 06:01.537
Okay. We're done here.

06:01.539 --> 06:02.872
Actually, we just started.

06:02.874 --> 06:04.006
No, I'm talking about
the part where I ask her

06:04.008 --> 06:05.291
to spell her best friend's name.

06:05.293 --> 06:06.542
Ah, yeah, that. We're done with that.

06:06.544 --> 06:07.793
My mistake.

06:07.795 --> 06:09.011
Please, won't you come in and sit down

06:09.013 --> 06:10.346
on my off-white linen sectional?

06:13.101 --> 06:15.518
Mrs. Parsons, as I'm sure you're aware,

06:15.520 --> 06:19.355
82% of murders are committed
by someone close to the victim.

06:19.357 --> 06:21.107
Well, wouldn't they have to
be close to them

06:21.109 --> 06:22.058
in order to murder them?

06:22.060 --> 06:24.144
She's good. Mm.

06:24.243 --> 06:25.476
I hate to ask you this,

06:25.578 --> 06:28.462
but were there any other women
in the picture?

06:28.464 --> 06:29.997
Oh, just those two.

06:29.999 --> 06:32.750
Bet that made you pretty mad, huh?

06:32.752 --> 06:34.001
Look, I know what you're insinuating,

06:34.003 --> 06:35.836
but let me set the record straight.

06:37.139 --> 06:38.322
Sorry. I have O.C.D.

06:38.324 --> 06:40.224
This has been driving me crazy
this whole time.

06:40.226 --> 06:41.675
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

06:41.677 --> 06:44.978
nose, nose, nose, ears, eyes, and go.

06:44.980 --> 06:46.730
Look, I married a ventriloquist.

06:46.732 --> 06:49.900
I was very aware of
what I was getting myself into.

06:49.902 --> 06:52.050
I knew I'd be dealing with the mistresses

06:52.050 --> 06:53.966
and the long hours and the drugs.

06:53.969 --> 06:55.602
But I loved my husband.

06:55.604 --> 06:59.056
And more than that, I loved
being a ventriloquist's wife.

06:59.058 --> 07:02.059
Thank you for your Time
and for answering our questions.

07:02.061 --> 07:04.227
Please let me know if there's
anything I can do to help.

07:04.229 --> 07:06.813
I just really hope that you
catch the animal that did this.

07:06.815 --> 07:08.065
Thank you, ma'am,

07:08.067 --> 07:09.866
but we think it was a human who did it.

07:09.868 --> 07:11.701
Good day.

07:11.703 --> 07:12.819
Jinx.

07:12.821 --> 07:14.404
Nose, nose, nose, ears, eyes...

07:15.574 --> 07:16.574
And go.

07:18.877 --> 07:20.077
What... just...

07:27.536 --> 07:30.153
Hey. I heard we caught a witness
in the ventriloquist murder.

07:30.155 --> 07:34.124
Yeah. I'm about to go take
a run at him right now.

07:34.126 --> 07:35.459
Hey, you want a snickers bar?

07:35.461 --> 07:37.244
Two came out of the machine by mistake.

07:37.246 --> 07:40.330
- Wow. That must be doubly satisfying.
- It is.

07:40.332 --> 07:42.749
Snickers really satisfies.

07:42.751 --> 07:44.084
Snickers really satisfies.

07:44.086 --> 07:46.336
- Do they really satisfy?
- They really satisfy.

07:46.338 --> 07:48.588
Snickers really satisfies.

07:48.590 --> 07:51.174
I'm gonna get my satisfy
on with a snickers.

07:51.176 --> 07:52.759
Good luck in there. All right.

07:58.851 --> 08:00.901
You think this is a game?

08:00.903 --> 08:03.019
This isn't a game.

08:03.021 --> 08:06.356
This is a game.

08:06.358 --> 08:10.243
This is Life. You are looking at life.

08:10.245 --> 08:13.413
And if you don't start talking,
I promise you...

08:14.370 --> 08:17.288
You're gonna be in real trouble.

08:17.651 --> 08:21.736
Candy Land, Chutes and Ladders, Monopoly.

08:21.738 --> 08:23.405
I could do this all day.

08:23.407 --> 08:24.706
But I'm gonna tell you something
right now...

08:24.708 --> 08:28.076
If you don't give me something...

08:28.078 --> 08:29.661
You're gonna be sorry.

08:29.663 --> 08:33.664
And I'm gonna shut down
this whole operation.

08:34.967 --> 08:36.668
And if you think I'm gonna back down

08:38.004 --> 08:43.174
Brother, I am one hungry, hungry hippo.

08:43.176 --> 08:44.309
You hear me?

08:44.311 --> 08:46.261
And you...

08:46.263 --> 08:50.899
You're about to go kerplunk.

08:52.152 --> 08:54.269
Gnip gnop!

08:54.271 --> 08:56.521
He isn't talking.

09:03.282 --> 09:05.032
Anything new in the ventriloquist case?

09:05.732 --> 09:07.364
Parsons died from a gunshot wound,

09:07.366 --> 09:08.699
but there's no weapon

09:08.701 --> 09:10.889
and not a lot of prints or DNA to go on.

09:10.889 --> 09:13.523
But look what I found on Lance the dummy.

09:15.226 --> 09:17.276
What are those scratches?
Defensive wounds?

09:17.278 --> 09:19.395
Whoever did this
is looking at the business end

09:19.397 --> 09:21.113
of a nasty splinter.

09:21.115 --> 09:23.065
All right, I'm gonna cut into him,

09:23.067 --> 09:24.950
so if you're squeamish, look away.

09:24.952 --> 09:27.036
It's not my first rodeo.

09:27.038 --> 09:29.121
This isn't a rodeo. This is an autopsy.

09:29.123 --> 09:31.040
There is a rodeo in town, though,

09:31.042 --> 09:32.791
if you want to go with me later.

09:47.451 --> 09:50.318
All right, let's check
the contents of the stomach.

09:51.666 --> 09:52.748
Ohh.

09:52.750 --> 09:55.334
Looks like someone had a last meal.

09:55.336 --> 09:56.886
Thumb drive.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.261
It's a manuscript.

10:05.263 --> 10:07.897
- Can you open it?
- No. It's encrypted.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.015
Child's play.

10:09.017 --> 10:11.517
Geils, Scholls,

10:11.519 --> 10:14.070
I spent 10 years with mi-5
as their top code-breaker

10:14.072 --> 10:16.355
and then two years in
the kitchen as a dishwasher.

10:16.357 --> 10:17.773
What do we have here?

10:18.776 --> 10:20.526
Ah.

10:25.533 --> 10:26.782
Ah, yes.

10:26.784 --> 10:29.785
A very complicated
south Korean military code.

10:29.787 --> 10:32.538
There are over 9 billion possible
permuta...

10:32.540 --> 10:34.373
Oh, I'm in.

10:34.375 --> 10:36.008
Oh, god.

10:36.010 --> 10:39.462
"A Ventrloquist Speaks: The
Book That Could Get Me Killed,"

10:39.464 --> 10:40.713
by Alan Parsons.

10:40.715 --> 10:43.716
It's a 1,200-page amateur memoir.

10:43.718 --> 10:45.217
Someone's gonna have to comb over

10:45.219 --> 10:47.853
every over-dramatic memory,
every clumsy metaphor,

10:47.855 --> 10:49.388
trying to find some sort of clue

10:49.390 --> 10:52.525
as to why this man was killed.

10:58.566 --> 11:00.566
I'm gonna miss the rodeo.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.691
Hey, Tanner, any red flags
in Parsons' finances?

11:04.693 --> 11:07.360
We're looking for a reason
someone would want him dead.

11:07.362 --> 11:08.444
Not much.

11:08.446 --> 11:11.114
I mean, we can give you what we got.

11:11.116 --> 11:13.833
Okay. No, don't print.
Just attach the PDF.

11:13.835 --> 11:15.368
No. Don't do that.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.170
No, no, no. Don't cancel it now.

11:17.172 --> 11:19.205
It's going down to the downstairs printer.

11:19.207 --> 11:20.340
Jay Geils here.

11:20.342 --> 11:21.708
It's Monica Scholls.

11:21.710 --> 11:24.927
I just found something
interesting in the book.

11:24.929 --> 11:26.296
Thank god. Where are you?

11:26.298 --> 11:28.548
Where I always read... in a bubble bath.

11:35.588 --> 11:37.288
Lieutenant, what are you doing here?

11:37.290 --> 11:39.623
This is the only place I get cell service.

11:39.625 --> 11:40.958
That's a stapler.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.960
Holly, where is my cellphone?!

11:42.962 --> 11:45.181
I'll just text her.

11:45.181 --> 11:48.015
- That's a calculator.
- Damn it!

11:48.016 --> 11:49.599
What's in the book?

11:49.601 --> 11:52.185
Parsons reveals all the secrets
behind ventriloquism.

11:52.187 --> 11:53.687
That knowledge is sacred.

11:53.689 --> 11:56.489
- Isn't it just not moving...
- Zip it, Tanner.

11:56.491 --> 11:58.191
Whoever did this already killed one man.

11:58.193 --> 11:59.776
There's a whole chapter in here

11:59.778 --> 12:02.245
on how his mentor passed down
all his secrets to him.

12:02.247 --> 12:04.435
- Who's his mentor?
- Uh...

12:04.435 --> 12:06.018
Damn. There's some water on the page.

12:06.020 --> 12:07.269
I can't quite make it out.

12:07.271 --> 12:08.771
Let me help you.

12:08.773 --> 12:11.273
I think that's a... I think that's a "g."

12:11.275 --> 12:13.108
- No. That's a "j."
- You sure?

12:13.110 --> 12:14.910
- Or a 5.
- The bubbles are...

12:14.912 --> 12:16.829
- There's so many that you can't see any...
- It's an "f."

12:16.831 --> 12:19.999
Fisher Price. My hero.

12:20.001 --> 12:24.870
Well, it looks like your hero
just became our prime suspect.

12:26.257 --> 12:28.123
Aw. What?

12:28.125 --> 12:29.625
Really? That's disappointing.

12:35.116 --> 12:37.416
Wow. Look at this place.

12:37.418 --> 12:40.836
- Can I help you?
- We have an appointment with Mr. Price.

12:50.794 --> 12:52.627
Hey, hey. Psst.

12:52.629 --> 12:53.761
What?

12:54.514 --> 12:56.297
Look at the rack on that one!

12:56.299 --> 12:58.766
Walter, no, no.

12:58.768 --> 13:00.218
Sorry. He's drunk.

13:00.220 --> 13:02.103
Won't you sit down?

13:03.356 --> 13:05.306
Ladies.

13:09.896 --> 13:12.730
I hope there's been a break
in the Parsons case.

13:12.732 --> 13:13.898
Such a tragedy.

13:13.900 --> 13:15.566
Actually, we have had
a little breakthrough.

13:15.568 --> 13:17.568
It turns out that Parsons
was writing a book

13:17.570 --> 13:20.571
exposing all the secrets
of ventriloquism... mm.

13:20.573 --> 13:22.740
Specifically, your secrets.

13:23.460 --> 13:24.826
Did we catch you off-guard?

13:24.828 --> 13:25.910
Not at all.

13:25.912 --> 13:27.879
I was aware of the book.

13:27.881 --> 13:28.913
Did it bother you?

13:28.915 --> 13:30.214
Of course not.

13:30.216 --> 13:31.582
Knowing how to make sausage

13:31.584 --> 13:33.918
doesn't make you a master sausage man.

13:33.920 --> 13:36.754
Besides, no one can do what I do.

13:36.756 --> 13:38.172
Or should I say...

13:38.174 --> 13:40.091
What we do.

13:47.600 --> 13:50.935
Hey. You're a chick? I had no idea.

13:50.937 --> 13:52.770
'Cause you think it's coming... hey!

13:52.772 --> 13:54.355
Where do you get your hair cut,
a salon school?

13:54.357 --> 13:56.157
Oh, you don't want to play
with me, old man.

13:56.159 --> 13:59.666
Hey, aren't you that
little boy in "Indiana Jones"?

13:59.666 --> 14:02.333
Look, Mr. Price, you've
always been a hero of mine,

14:02.334 --> 14:03.628
but if there's anything
you want to tell us,

14:03.628 --> 14:04.878
now's the time to come clean.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.880
I have nothing to hide, Detective.

14:06.881 --> 14:09.214
Yes, I was concerned about the book,

14:09.216 --> 14:10.832
but I'm not a murderer.

14:10.834 --> 14:13.468
I notice there's a band-aid on your finger.

14:13.470 --> 14:16.338
Would that be covering a splinter?

14:16.340 --> 14:17.673
It's not unusual

14:17.675 --> 14:19.424
for a ventriloquist to get a splinter.

14:19.426 --> 14:20.926
The dummies are made of wood.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.811
Would you mind if I took a look
at your splinter?

14:22.813 --> 14:24.513
I'd be happy to show you my splinter

14:24.515 --> 14:26.348
if you'd be happy to show me a warrant.

14:26.350 --> 14:29.685
Any warrant or one
that's specific to this case?

14:31.021 --> 14:32.487
That's what I thought.

14:32.489 --> 14:34.690
If you'll excuse us... we have to go pack.

14:34.692 --> 14:36.742
After tonight's sold-out show...

14:36.744 --> 14:38.911
We're leaving on a 50-country tour.

14:38.913 --> 14:41.413
And all of them are outside of America.

14:41.415 --> 14:43.498
We're gonna take you down, Price,

14:43.500 --> 14:44.866
and your little dummy, too.

14:44.868 --> 14:46.702
I'd like to see you try.

14:46.704 --> 14:48.120
Oh, you want to go?

14:48.122 --> 14:49.705
You want a piece of this?

14:49.707 --> 14:51.456
I will take you, you little... no! No!

14:51.458 --> 14:53.375
Bitch! That was a great
back-and-forth, really convincing.

14:53.377 --> 14:54.543
Little bitch!

14:54.545 --> 14:55.627
How do you make the "p" sound?

14:55.629 --> 14:57.045
The "p" stop. The "p" stop.

15:00.551 --> 15:01.883
A splinter?

15:01.885 --> 15:03.435
A splinter?!

15:03.437 --> 15:04.636
It's too thin!

15:04.638 --> 15:06.188
We know he did it.

15:06.190 --> 15:08.440
The book would have ruined him,
so he iced Parsons.

15:08.442 --> 15:09.808
Iced Parsons?

15:09.810 --> 15:11.693
I could go for an iced parsons.

15:11.695 --> 15:13.729
Holly, bring me an iced parsons!

15:13.731 --> 15:15.230
Let's haul Price in here,

15:15.232 --> 15:17.065
get that splinter out,
match it to the dead dummy,

15:17.067 --> 15:18.233
and put him away.

15:18.235 --> 15:20.736
We've got to get tickets
to that show tonight.

15:20.738 --> 15:23.121
Get tickets to the Fisher Price
show the night of?

15:23.123 --> 15:25.240
Okay, that should be easy.

15:25.242 --> 15:26.875
Uh, hello, ticket people?

15:26.877 --> 15:28.460
Could I get two tickets to the show

15:28.462 --> 15:29.962
that's been sold-out for four years?

15:29.964 --> 15:31.380
Let me check that for you, sir.

15:31.382 --> 15:33.081
No. I'm sorry, sir.

15:33.083 --> 15:35.584
That show is completely sold out.
Well, thank you for checking.

15:35.586 --> 15:36.835
Is there anything else
you want me to look up?

15:36.837 --> 15:39.054
No, that's it.

15:39.056 --> 15:41.723
Have a great weekend. You too.

15:41.725 --> 15:43.759
I told you. It's impossible.

15:43.784 --> 15:47.229
- Geils, you're a ventriloquist.
- That was private.

15:47.229 --> 15:49.896
We'll sneak in backstage, and we'll
pretend we're the opening act.

15:49.898 --> 15:53.066
Was. I was a ventriloquist.
There's a big difference.

15:53.068 --> 15:54.567
What? You're a ventriloquist?

15:54.569 --> 15:57.372
- Well, she's a girl!
- Oh, you are a dead man!

15:57.372 --> 15:58.872
- You are! You pee sitting down!
- Hey! Hey!

15:58.874 --> 16:00.707
- You want to go?
- Hey!

16:00.709 --> 16:02.759
- I will take you down right now!
- You're a girl, but that's my secret.

16:02.761 --> 16:04.295
Knock it off, you two! Hey! Stop!

16:04.295 --> 16:05.628
I swear to god!

16:05.630 --> 16:07.680
S... quiet!

16:07.681 --> 16:11.132
Stop talking now!

16:11.870 --> 16:15.205
Zip it! Quiet!

16:17.042 --> 16:18.174
No more fighting!

16:19.341 --> 16:21.842
If there is a way
to tie Price to this murder,

16:21.845 --> 16:23.011
I want it to happen.

16:23.013 --> 16:24.812
And I always get what I want.

16:24.814 --> 16:26.814
We didn't have an iced parsons.

16:26.816 --> 16:29.267
Would you settle for
a lukewarm glass of water?

16:30.854 --> 16:32.917
So exasperated!

16:35.559 --> 16:37.258
It's closed. Let's go.

16:38.437 --> 16:39.569
Can I help you?

16:39.583 --> 16:41.213
We're the opening act.

16:41.335 --> 16:43.051
Yeah, right.

16:43.053 --> 16:43.624
We are.

16:43.624 --> 16:45.924
Oh. Sorry about the inquisition.

16:45.926 --> 16:48.043
We get a lot of crazies.

16:48.045 --> 16:49.294
Fisher Price.

16:49.296 --> 16:51.764
Fisher Price.

16:51.766 --> 16:54.266
Fisher Price.

16:54.268 --> 16:56.602
Fisher Price.

16:56.604 --> 16:58.604
Fisher Price.

16:58.583 --> 17:00.333
Fisher Price.

17:00.358 --> 17:01.690
Fisher Price. Hey, guys, let's go.

17:01.692 --> 17:02.725
You're the opening act, right?

17:02.727 --> 17:03.776
- No.
- Yes.

17:03.778 --> 17:05.560
You're on in 30 seconds.

17:14.571 --> 17:15.988
Dude, you got this.

17:15.990 --> 17:17.740
- Dude, I do not have this.
- Dude.

17:17.742 --> 17:19.074
- Dude.
- Dude.

17:19.076 --> 17:21.492
- No.
- Dude, I know you can do this.

17:21.494 --> 17:23.328
- How?
- Because you've already done it.

17:23.329 --> 17:24.496
I was humiliated.

17:24.498 --> 17:27.215
But you had the guts
to put yourself out there...

17:27.218 --> 17:30.386
Which is more than I can say
for someone else I know.

17:30.388 --> 17:32.671
Angie, you're on right now.

17:32.673 --> 17:34.056
Uh, I have to go.

17:34.058 --> 17:35.974
I left the stove on in the Dollhouse.

17:38.345 --> 17:39.178
You.

17:39.180 --> 17:40.813
I didn't make it back in time,

17:40.815 --> 17:42.431
and my Dollhouse burnt to the ground.

17:42.433 --> 17:45.734
The point is, I didn't put
myself out there, but you did.

17:45.736 --> 17:47.102
That's all that really matters.

17:47.104 --> 17:49.071
Opening act, places.

17:49.073 --> 17:51.106
- So bossy.
- Hey.

18:15.216 --> 18:18.016
Geils, I believe in you.

18:18.018 --> 18:19.802
- I can't.
- You can do it.

18:19.804 --> 18:21.553
- I can't.
- You can do it.

18:21.555 --> 18:24.973
Now, just stick your hand
up my back and make me talk.

18:24.975 --> 18:27.309
Not... not there.

18:27.311 --> 18:29.394
No, no, no. Uh, no. Oh. Oh.

18:30.397 --> 18:32.147
Okay.

18:32.149 --> 18:35.033
So, Angie, how you doing tonight?

18:37.872 --> 18:39.154
Pretty good.

18:56.090 --> 18:57.723
Angie, talk to me.

18:57.725 --> 18:59.224
I'm okay.

18:59.226 --> 19:01.426
I'm wearing a bulletproof bustier.

19:01.428 --> 19:03.262
You should go get Price.

19:03.264 --> 19:04.313
No way.

19:04.315 --> 19:06.181
A v-quist never leaves his dummy.

19:06.183 --> 19:09.935
Hey. I'm no dummy. I'm your partner.

19:09.937 --> 19:11.737
Now go get him.

19:11.739 --> 19:13.689
All right, Price, drop the gun.

19:13.691 --> 19:15.357
Or have Walter drop the gun.

19:15.359 --> 19:17.409
Or you drop Walter, and then
Walter can drop the gun.

19:17.411 --> 19:20.245
In any of these scenarios,
I want the gun out of there.

19:23.334 --> 19:25.367
Put the gun down, Price. I'm warning you.

19:25.369 --> 19:27.703
You don't have the guts, Detective.

19:27.705 --> 19:29.371
I saw your pathetic show.

19:29.373 --> 19:32.007
You'll never work as a ventriloquist.

19:32.009 --> 19:35.460
Maybe not, but neither will you...

19:35.462 --> 19:38.380
'Cause you forgot the most important rule.

19:42.614 --> 19:45.114
Keep your mouth shut.

19:46.584 --> 19:49.078
Cuff him, boys.

19:52.707 --> 19:56.342
Ladies and gentlemen, Detective Jay Geils!

20:14.292 --> 20:16.253
Just finished the Price report.

20:16.253 --> 20:18.169
Want to get a beer?

20:18.171 --> 20:19.587
Yeah, sure.

20:21.308 --> 20:23.892
Hey, what was your dream, anyway?

20:23.894 --> 20:25.059
Oh, it was stupid.

20:31.568 --> 20:34.269
I wonder if I'll ever see her again.

20:34.912 --> 20:36.628
Ready?
