WEBVTT

00:42.250 --> 00:45.125
Rose, stay put, alright?
And keep your head down.

00:45.208 --> 00:47.291
You never know what these
darkies will try and pull.

00:47.375 --> 00:49.375
Wait, Curtis.
You hear that music?

00:49.458 --> 00:51.500
Take it easy, alright?
Crank that window up.

01:00.041 --> 01:01.166
Collins, where you been?

01:01.250 --> 01:02.333
'I'm damn near dry in here.'

01:02.417 --> 01:04.542
Can't help it.
I got wide demand.

01:04.625 --> 01:05.792
Hey, chickadee.

02:12.083 --> 02:13.291
Watch it, buddy.

02:15.417 --> 02:17.166
Rose Collins,
get in the dang car!

02:20.000 --> 02:22.208
'What're you
apin' at anyway?'

02:22.291 --> 02:24.000
I ain't. I'm not..

02:26.000 --> 02:27.875
...lookin'.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.458
Commercial diver
checking for sewage leaks

03:17.542 --> 03:18.875
found this truck
with a body in it.

03:18.959 --> 03:21.458
Dredged it up
from the Delaware this
morning.

03:21.542 --> 03:22.917
(Lilly)
Was it down there long?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.667
- I'd say so.
- No kidding.

03:24.750 --> 03:26.750
(Nick)
Guy in my neighborhood had
one of these vintage jobbies.

03:26.834 --> 03:29.792
Spray you with a garden hose
if you got close to it.

03:29.875 --> 03:33.250
- How old we think it is?
- It's gotta be early '30s.

03:33.333 --> 03:36.125
The headlights mounted
on the bar, not the fender?

03:36.208 --> 03:37.625
Means it's pre-'35.

03:37.709 --> 03:38.917
We'll get an exact year
when we match up

03:39.000 --> 03:40.417
the plates and VIN number.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.417
(Nick)
'Truck was
halfway stuck in the mud.'

03:42.500 --> 03:44.291
'Kept them bones
from getting turned into
sand.'

03:44.375 --> 03:46.625
We got a reason to think
it wasn't just bad driving?

03:47.959 --> 03:49.083
'bout a dozen.

03:49.166 --> 03:50.917
CSU has something
that might explain

03:51.000 --> 03:52.208
the reason
for the bullet holes.

03:52.291 --> 03:53.583
Remains of a glass jug

03:53.667 --> 03:55.458
and copper tubing
found underneath the seat.

03:55.542 --> 03:56.875
Tubing for what?

03:56.959 --> 03:59.959
Oh, you add sugar and
rubbing alcohol, Lil

04:00.041 --> 04:01.625
you're making moonshine.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.000
(Scotty)
Bootlegging.

04:03.083 --> 04:05.375
- Hot.
- 70 years dead.

04:05.458 --> 04:07.000
(Scotty)
'Nice and cold for ya.'

04:07.083 --> 04:08.417
Could be our new record.

04:41.667 --> 04:43.542
I called in a favor
with Auto Squad.

04:43.625 --> 04:45.166
Turned up a match
for our plates.

04:45.250 --> 04:46.834
1931 Dodge pickup.

04:46.917 --> 04:48.709
Registered to
a Curtis Collins.

04:48.792 --> 04:50.333
Could this
Collins be our bones?

04:50.417 --> 04:51.542
Nah, he's accounted for.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.959
Fact, guy's
still
kickin' it

04:53.041 --> 04:54.875
at a retirement
place in Haverford.

04:54.959 --> 04:56.667
Lil and Vera are on
their way out there.

04:56.750 --> 04:58.417
We know if he ever
reported his truck stolen?

04:58.500 --> 05:00.291
Nope. 'Cause
Curtis Collins had good reason

05:00.375 --> 05:03.208
to keep the cops far away from
his truck. It's like we
thought.

05:03.291 --> 05:06.000
Picked up twice for illegal
distribution of alcohol

05:06.083 --> 05:08.208
and violation
of the 18th Amendment.

05:09.959 --> 05:12.875
Curtis Collins,
bona fide bootlegger.

05:12.959 --> 05:14.917
And the truck
was the company car.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.125
(Scotty)
Glad we brought you
a challenge for once, Frannie?

05:17.208 --> 05:18.834
Outside of paleontology camp?

05:18.917 --> 05:21.000
This is the oldest
body I've ever worked on.

05:21.083 --> 05:22.834
You able to get
anything from what's left?

05:22.917 --> 05:24.375
Fractured skull
was the cause of death.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.875
From a gunshot?

05:25.959 --> 05:27.959
- Probably the accident.
- What else?

05:28.041 --> 05:29.750
We got the skull and pelvis
so I can tell you

05:29.834 --> 05:31.041
the victim was female.

05:31.125 --> 05:32.208
'Late adolescent
to young adult.'

05:32.291 --> 05:33.417
A girl?

05:33.500 --> 05:35.667
Had to be some lady
bootleggers, right?

05:41.417 --> 05:42.834
(Lilly)
'Curtis Collins?'

05:46.583 --> 05:48.250
This can't be good.

05:48.333 --> 05:51.250
Did you lose
a truck around 1930?

05:51.333 --> 05:54.917
Sure. You makin' reparations?

05:55.000 --> 05:57.542
It was dredged up from
the Delaware this morning.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.250
No kiddin'.

05:59.333 --> 06:01.875
(Nick)
'Had bullet holes all over
it
and a body inside.'

06:05.500 --> 06:07.500
A body?

06:07.583 --> 06:08.959
You don't say.

06:09.041 --> 06:10.583
Any idea who that was?

06:10.667 --> 06:14.458
Good chance that's my sister
in there. Rose.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.333
(Lilly)
'What makes
you think that?'

06:16.417 --> 06:20.125
She ran off with
my truck, August of '32.

06:20.208 --> 06:22.792
And you're just now
thinkin' she might be dead?

06:22.875 --> 06:24.333
When I couldn't
find her back

06:24.417 --> 06:27.458
when I thought she
didn't want to be found.

06:27.542 --> 06:28.667
You two on bad terms?

06:29.917 --> 06:33.458
No. Our father
killed himself

06:33.542 --> 06:35.542
after the bank
took his store.

06:35.625 --> 06:38.208
Mother was long dead.

06:38.291 --> 06:40.291
Leaving you in charge.

06:40.375 --> 06:42.583
Can you think of anyone
who'd want to hurt her?

06:42.667 --> 06:44.208
(Curtis)
'No.'

06:44.291 --> 06:49.583
Other than refusin' to heed
me, Rose was sweet as honey.

06:51.333 --> 06:52.792
Light up a room.

06:52.875 --> 06:55.041
Took a peek
at your file, Curtis.

06:55.125 --> 06:58.083
Selling moonshine
was a dangerous business.

06:58.166 --> 07:00.834
- That earn you some enemies?
- Guess so.

07:02.375 --> 07:06.834
'Cause as a young businessman,
I sure wasn't sweet.

07:06.917 --> 07:08.208
(Doc Win)
'Collins!'

07:11.041 --> 07:13.041
Reach over for your brother
and turn that engine off,
girly.

07:13.125 --> 07:14.667
Easy there, Doc Win.

07:14.750 --> 07:17.792
Had a nip of that gasoline you
trying you pass off as whiskey.

07:17.875 --> 07:19.625
Tastes like you ran
it through with
fertilizer.

07:19.709 --> 07:22.458
The only fertilizer here's
the lies you're droppin',
Doc.

07:22.542 --> 07:24.166
About done
dealin' with you,
Collins.

07:24.250 --> 07:27.208
(Curtis)
'This block is my territory
and I am fierce'

07:27.291 --> 07:28.875
in protecting it.

07:28.959 --> 07:30.834
You won't find another
outfit willin' to supply
you.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.667
'Less you're dead and gone.
Then we'd all celebrate.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.625
Please don't hurt him!
Take, take another--

07:35.709 --> 07:37.166
Dang it, Rose!
What'd I say to you?

07:37.250 --> 07:38.834
Stay outta it, doll-face.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.542
I know you're not talkin'
to my sister familiar.

07:41.625 --> 07:44.709
- What if I am?
- You do not talk to her!

07:44.792 --> 07:46.667
Calm down
and leave the girl out of
it.

07:47.792 --> 07:48.959
Fertilizer-tastin' or not

07:49.041 --> 07:50.583
'the hooch is half
the draw of this place.'

07:50.667 --> 07:52.208
Other half bein'
the entertainers

07:52.291 --> 07:55.125
and they all need the hooch
to get in touch with the
muse.

07:56.208 --> 07:57.875
Go serve it up,
why don't ya?

08:01.875 --> 08:03.208
Yeah, well,
let's not talk business

08:03.291 --> 08:04.834
in front of the females.

08:04.917 --> 08:06.667
I'll catch
up with you another
time..

08:08.375 --> 08:09.500
...friend.

08:13.041 --> 08:16.125
So this Doc Win thought you were
selling him an inferior product.

08:16.208 --> 08:20.166
There were fellas making
liquor
out of hair tonic.

08:20.250 --> 08:23.417
Least I put corn
syrup in the mix.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.458
And Doc Win didn't see
you being decent that way.

08:25.542 --> 08:26.834
Not at all.

08:26.917 --> 08:28.542
So if Rose was in your truck
maybe some of your

08:28.625 --> 08:31.792
business contacts thought
they were offing you instead.

08:34.750 --> 08:36.417
Yeah.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.458
Well, Doc Win
knew the
truck.

08:38.542 --> 08:42.750
Always said
it rattled a particular way.

08:42.834 --> 08:44.208
Irked him.

08:46.458 --> 08:47.875
(Will)
'We know
this is a stretch, Celia'

08:47.959 --> 08:49.917
asking you about
your great-grandfather.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.500
Doc Win's
a legend in our family.

08:51.583 --> 08:52.834
I've been hearing
about him my whole life.

08:52.917 --> 08:54.083
Well, he had a beef
with a guy named

08:54.166 --> 08:56.083
Curtis Collins,
a bootlegger.

08:56.166 --> 08:59.000
Curtis's truck was pulled up
from the Delaware today

08:59.083 --> 09:00.250
with a body inside.

09:00.333 --> 09:01.750
We think
it may be his
sister.

09:01.834 --> 09:04.792
And you think Doc
had something to do with that.

09:04.875 --> 09:05.792
Possible.

09:05.875 --> 09:08.458
Her name was Rose Collins.

09:08.542 --> 09:09.667
'Ring any bells?'

09:10.959 --> 09:14.834
The name, no.
But the face..

09:14.917 --> 09:16.250
...from Doc's album.

09:21.583 --> 09:23.583
This is the same girl, right?

09:23.667 --> 09:25.000
(Will)
'It is. Sure.'

09:25.083 --> 09:27.125
I've looked at this picture
so many times.

09:27.208 --> 09:28.792
You know anything
about this girl?

09:28.875 --> 09:31.166
My grandma used to tell me
stories that Doc told her.

09:32.208 --> 09:33.834
My favorite was
about this night

09:33.917 --> 09:36.417
when Billie Holiday
came to play Doc Win's.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.875
Whaddya think
of this one,
Billie?

09:45.959 --> 09:48.667
She ain't bad. She's got my
name. That's in her favor.

10:02.542 --> 10:03.959
(Doc Win)
'Ah, no.'

10:07.875 --> 10:09.166
Your brother
know you're here?

10:09.250 --> 10:11.959
No. Please don't
toss me out 'cause of him.

10:12.041 --> 10:14.959
I got money to buy
drinks just like she does.

10:15.041 --> 10:16.333
A cordial, please.

10:24.250 --> 10:26.709
Hello.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.250
Bible Study's out the door,
three blocks down.

10:30.625 --> 10:31.834
I'm here
for the
music.

10:33.542 --> 10:37.625
Watch out. She don't sing
'bout lollipops and flowers.

10:37.709 --> 10:40.375
This ain't no place for you.
Why don't you go on home?

10:40.458 --> 10:42.041
I need to listen a while.

10:49.125 --> 10:50.417
Pardon me.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.709
Could I try one
of your
cigarettes?

10:52.792 --> 10:53.917
Fresh out.

10:55.583 --> 10:57.250
Dang it!

10:57.333 --> 10:58.500
My hat was off.

11:00.166 --> 11:02.417
How come your mother
lets you dress like a
boy?

11:03.959 --> 11:06.542
I do what I please,
first off.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.208
And I ain't dressed
like a boy.

11:08.291 --> 11:09.750
I'm dressed
like a fox.

11:16.625 --> 11:19.250
Doc Win, you gotta go give this
Sunday-best-wearin' white girl

11:19.333 --> 11:22.083
her very first cigarette
while I'm tryin' to listen?

11:22.166 --> 11:23.375
Why don't you hit the skids?

11:23.458 --> 11:24.959
I have a drink I paid for.

11:34.625 --> 11:36.291
Now shoo, fly,
and don't come back.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.750
Story was Rose
was the first white girl

11:51.834 --> 11:53.208
to come to Doc Win's.

11:53.291 --> 11:55.375
Lured in by the music.

11:55.458 --> 11:58.792
Doc said it was a testament
to the blues being universal.

11:58.875 --> 12:02.291
And who was this Billie
giving Rose a hard time?

12:02.375 --> 12:03.875
One of the regular customers.

12:03.959 --> 12:06.583
Read in the
club's poetry readings, too.

12:06.667 --> 12:09.125
Can we hold onto this album
a little while?

12:09.208 --> 12:12.208
Sure. And I've got boxes
of Doc Win memorabilia

12:12.291 --> 12:13.792
that I've been
meaning to go through.

12:13.875 --> 12:15.917
If I find anything else,
I'll give you a call.

12:22.291 --> 12:24.250
So Rose Collins
might have been the type

12:24.333 --> 12:25.667
to stick her nose
where it didn't belong.

12:25.750 --> 12:27.291
She definitely
wasn't welcome at Doc Win's.

12:27.375 --> 12:28.709
(Lilly)
Looked at the old ledgers.

12:28.792 --> 12:31.333
Doc Win's wasn't
a good girl's kinda place.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.625
Cops arrested
people there every weekend.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.291
Shady clientele?

12:35.375 --> 12:38.083
Drunks, women of ill-repute..

12:38.166 --> 12:39.834
...artist types.

12:39.917 --> 12:42.875
So maybe Rose goes back
to Doc Win's and this Billie

12:42.959 --> 12:46.834
or someone else there,
takes issue with her.

12:46.917 --> 12:49.583
Hey. I did some more
looking at your girl's
skull.

12:49.667 --> 12:51.667
- And?
- There's no nasal sill.

12:51.750 --> 12:53.792
The little bone
at the base of the nose.

12:53.875 --> 12:55.166
Nose bone mean somethin'?

12:55.250 --> 12:56.500
It's one of the ways
to determine race

12:56.583 --> 12:58.500
from skeletal remains.

12:58.583 --> 13:00.291
Your victim
was African American.

13:08.834 --> 13:10.750
Well, Rose Collins
is still alive.

13:11.917 --> 13:12.834
No kidding.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.291
Living somewhere
up in Manhattan.

13:14.375 --> 13:15.542
Got a last known address.

13:15.625 --> 13:16.875
You got a name for our bones?

13:16.959 --> 13:19.083
So far, six young
black women disappeared

13:19.166 --> 13:20.959
or assumed dead
around '32.

13:21.041 --> 13:22.500
Saved that stack for you.

13:22.583 --> 13:25.250
- It's a birthday present.
- When's your birthday?

13:25.333 --> 13:27.458
- Tomorrow.
- How you celebrating?

13:27.542 --> 13:29.375
I'm 60.
I'm almost dead.

13:29.458 --> 13:31.250
I'm going home tonight,
writing out my will.

13:33.083 --> 13:34.667
Okay.

13:34.750 --> 13:38.625
Most interesting name
I found, Wilhemina Doucette.

13:38.709 --> 13:40.291
Nickname "Billie."

13:40.375 --> 13:41.750
(Nick)
'The girl from Doc Win's.'

13:41.834 --> 13:43.166
Check out her mug shot.

13:43.250 --> 13:45.250
Looks like she thinks
this whole arrest thing's
funny.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.709
(Will)
'Hm, girl had a close
relationship with Philly
PD.'

13:47.792 --> 13:51.000
Age 12, Juvenile Division
picks
her up for curfew violation.

13:51.083 --> 13:53.709
Age 14, engaging in
illegal possession of
liquor.

13:53.792 --> 13:56.750
16, arrested for causing
a public disturbance

13:56.834 --> 13:59.250
by wearing men's pants.

13:59.333 --> 14:01.542
She sure liked
her boy's clothes.

14:01.625 --> 14:03.417
She was getting
in scrapes pretty regular

14:03.500 --> 14:05.792
till summer of '32.

14:05.875 --> 14:08.083
Then no more.
Great aunt files a
report

14:08.166 --> 14:09.875
when Billie
drops off the
map.

14:09.959 --> 14:11.417
Into the Delaware?

14:11.500 --> 14:13.041
Best answer so far.

14:13.125 --> 14:14.959
Maybe Rose can give us more.

14:24.792 --> 14:28.250
(Lilly)
'We thought you'd be
harder to find, Rose.'

14:28.333 --> 14:31.458
Seeing as your brother thought
you might've died in '32.

14:33.250 --> 14:34.500
I ran away that year.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.709
Curtis and I
haven't talked since.

14:37.792 --> 14:40.667
70-year sibling squabble.

14:40.750 --> 14:41.959
You got me beat.

14:42.041 --> 14:43.291
(Rose)
'He and I never got on.'

14:43.375 --> 14:45.583
He wanted me
under his thumb like a kid.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.208
I wanted to live.

14:47.291 --> 14:49.667
(Scotty)
'We got some
questions go way back, Rose.'

14:49.750 --> 14:51.750
You remember a woman
named Billie Doucette?

14:53.041 --> 14:55.166
Sure. She
was a character.

14:55.250 --> 14:58.166
Any idea how she could've
wound up in your brother's
truck

14:58.250 --> 15:00.417
August of '32?

15:00.500 --> 15:02.458
I lent it to her.

15:02.542 --> 15:04.458
You and
Billie were friendly?

15:04.542 --> 15:06.792
(Scotty)
''Cause we
heard she hassled you'

15:06.875 --> 15:09.709
the night Billie
Holiday
played Doc Win's.

15:09.792 --> 15:11.625
Hm. She did.

15:12.875 --> 15:14.834
But after that,
we became friends.

15:14.917 --> 15:17.333
So she borrowed your
truck and disappeared?

15:17.417 --> 15:20.000
I thought maybe
she took off for New York.

15:20.083 --> 15:21.834
And knowing what Curtis
would do if he found out

15:21.917 --> 15:25.375
she had his truck.
I followed her to get it
back.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.792
And that's how
you wound up here?

15:26.875 --> 15:29.333
(Rose)
'I never found her, though.'

15:29.417 --> 15:31.959
I was gonna go home
to Philly, but I, uh..

15:33.583 --> 15:34.959
...I met a Wall Street man..

15:36.250 --> 15:38.333
...and he became my husband.

15:38.417 --> 15:40.667
You remember Billie
having any enemies?

15:40.750 --> 15:43.875
She was saucy. Had her share
of rifts with people.

15:43.959 --> 15:46.583
Anyone who'd go so
far as to shoot at her?

15:46.667 --> 15:49.000
You've heard the expression
"A woman scorned.."?

16:03.208 --> 16:04.542
Goodbye.

16:04.625 --> 16:06.750
- Bye, Rose. See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

16:10.375 --> 16:12.000
"Sent that
girl away a night ago

16:12.083 --> 16:14.583
"And don't
she know it's been ashes.

16:14.667 --> 16:17.125
"Sent her away
and don't she know It ache.

16:18.291 --> 16:21.208
"Heart of mine,
throat of smoke

16:21.291 --> 16:24.709
"I sent a girl away and
it's been hell opened up

16:24.792 --> 16:27.333
"Working on my
skin
till it be bone."

16:37.458 --> 16:40.208
You're wearing a skirt.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.792
I clean house.
They make me.

16:45.166 --> 16:46.208
Well?

16:46.291 --> 16:49.375
Well, what?
That about me?

16:49.458 --> 16:51.750
It's one of my originals.

16:51.834 --> 16:55.500
How I express my truest
thoughts through poetry.

16:59.083 --> 17:01.583
I got one of my poems
published in a magazine.

17:01.667 --> 17:03.834
You heard of "Opportunity"?

17:03.917 --> 17:05.750
Published by WEB DuBois?

17:06.583 --> 17:08.542
Who's that?

17:08.625 --> 17:09.667
Wasn't them
chose me anyhow.

17:10.875 --> 17:13.583
They will,
when I move to New York.

17:13.667 --> 17:16.250
Was this other outfit,
equally prestigious, you know.

17:17.458 --> 17:19.917
- Paid me two dollars.
- Gee.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.291
You come back to the club
I'll buy you a real drink

17:22.375 --> 17:23.792
using my poem earnings.

17:25.750 --> 17:27.417
Thought you
didn't want me there.

17:29.125 --> 17:30.709
Alright, listen.

17:30.792 --> 17:34.000
I go with this
girl, Little Georgie

17:34.083 --> 17:35.625
'and she's batty.'

17:35.709 --> 17:37.291
You go with a girl?

17:37.375 --> 17:40.333
They're a headache,
but that's my taste.

17:42.208 --> 17:44.208
I have a beau.

17:44.291 --> 17:46.792
Ted. A boy.

17:46.875 --> 17:48.291
(Wilhemina)
'Your boy get jealous?'

17:48.375 --> 17:50.125
Sure. He's a hothead.

17:50.208 --> 17:51.750
Little Georgie's got
a pistol in her purse

17:51.834 --> 17:52.917
and I've seen her use it.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.375
You saying
she'd use it on me?

17:54.458 --> 17:56.583
(Wilhemina)
'If she came in,
saw us jawing.'

17:56.667 --> 17:58.709
But I broke it off with her.

17:58.792 --> 18:01.125
Told her I got the right
to new friends if I want
'em.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Will you
teach me how to smoke?

18:06.083 --> 18:07.750
Will you
teach me how to dance?

18:09.208 --> 18:11.458
Yeah, alright.

18:11.542 --> 18:14.000
Aw, no.
Uh, step in there.

18:16.083 --> 18:17.417
- That her?
- 'She followed me.'

18:17.500 --> 18:20.000
- 'You oughta go.'
- Billie Doucette!

18:20.083 --> 18:21.333
You stop in your tracks!

18:21.417 --> 18:22.959
And put some speed on it.

18:26.625 --> 18:30.333
So, Billie
had a thing for you.

18:30.417 --> 18:32.291
At first.

18:32.375 --> 18:34.667
Which was scandalous to me.

18:34.750 --> 18:36.542
But you still
became friends.

18:36.625 --> 18:40.458
I was taken by
the way she lived. So free.

18:40.542 --> 18:41.959
(Lilly)
'Wearing pants.'

18:42.041 --> 18:46.417
Smoking and cursing
and not caring who protested.

18:46.500 --> 18:50.625
And this, uh, Little
Georgie
was her jilted ex?

18:50.709 --> 18:54.625
Billie said
just ignore her but..

18:54.709 --> 18:56.250
...I couldn't
stop thinking about

18:56.333 --> 18:58.583
the pearl-handle
pistol she carried.

19:10.166 --> 19:12.083
You in my view, boys.

19:12.166 --> 19:14.875
Got to interrupt your vacation
for a minute, Little Georgie.

19:14.959 --> 19:16.917
What'd you call me?

19:17.000 --> 19:19.375
We meet in another life?

19:19.458 --> 19:21.250
Let's talk
about that life.

19:21.333 --> 19:23.083
You remember a girl
named Billie Doucette?

19:23.166 --> 19:27.166
Aw, no. That hurts.

19:27.250 --> 19:31.083
Back when, that girl
bruised my heart and good.

19:31.166 --> 19:32.709
And what'd you do in revenge?

19:32.792 --> 19:34.500
Revenge?

19:34.583 --> 19:35.959
Not my way.

19:36.041 --> 19:39.542
You stabbed a lady in '43
and spent five years in
prison.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.250
Woman got in the way
of me and my dance moves.

19:44.333 --> 19:48.291
Would it surprise you to hear
Billie was killed back in '32?

19:48.375 --> 19:51.000
Death don't surprise me.

19:51.083 --> 19:52.875
There were gunshots
in the back of the truck

19:52.959 --> 19:54.500
she was found dead in.

19:54.583 --> 19:56.875
Now we know you had a
fondness for using your
pistol.

19:56.959 --> 19:59.250
Billie had enough
trouble coming her way.

19:59.333 --> 20:00.542
Didn't need mine.

20:00.625 --> 20:02.083
What kind of
trouble we talking about?

20:02.166 --> 20:06.291
Worst kind. Kind that comes
with being sweet

20:06.375 --> 20:09.083
on an innocent,
little white girl.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.875
Hit me again, Doc.

20:10.959 --> 20:13.750
I can still feel
my damn heart beating.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.959
I never slow-danced before.

20:37.709 --> 20:40.000
Ted doesn't like dancing.

20:40.083 --> 20:42.083
You like it?

20:48.208 --> 20:49.709
In New York
you can go to ten clubs

20:49.792 --> 20:51.125
like this
in a single
night.

20:52.750 --> 20:54.000
That'd be nice.

20:54.083 --> 20:55.500
(Rose)
'Dancing all night.'

20:55.583 --> 20:57.083
I bet we'd have
fun there.

20:59.041 --> 21:00.166
- Ted!
- Rose!

21:00.250 --> 21:01.750
You know what
kind of a place this is?

21:01.834 --> 21:03.542
You got to be
out of your mind.

21:04.917 --> 21:06.041
You've been drinking.

21:06.125 --> 21:07.834
My brother's
a bootlegger, Ted.

21:07.917 --> 21:09.625
'Been bound to happen.'

21:09.709 --> 21:11.583
You being lippy just then?

21:11.667 --> 21:13.000
That's the hooch
and it don't suit you.

21:13.083 --> 21:14.875
You were supposed
to say, "Can I cut in?"

21:17.709 --> 21:19.959
So this is the one.

21:20.041 --> 21:22.250
My pal saw you two
outside of St. Abigail's.

21:24.291 --> 21:26.000
She's a queer, Rose.

21:26.083 --> 21:27.333
'And she brought you
down here to get you'

21:27.417 --> 21:28.917
'sauced and take advantage.'

21:29.000 --> 21:30.125
No. No, no. We're just..

21:30.208 --> 21:32.625
You the one
that don't dance?

21:32.709 --> 21:37.542
Man can't move his feet's
a man can't move when it
counts.

21:43.792 --> 21:46.542
Drinks is on me everybody!

21:48.458 --> 21:50.792
You hear about any fallout
from this Ted situation?

21:52.458 --> 21:55.625
But not too much after's
when Billie took a powder.

21:55.709 --> 21:57.375
You mean, was killed.

21:57.458 --> 21:58.750
Guess that's right.

22:00.625 --> 22:02.709
Tell you what..

22:02.792 --> 22:07.625
..men do not like
having another woman

22:07.709 --> 22:10.000
as romantic competition.

22:10.083 --> 22:11.333
Okay.

22:11.417 --> 22:14.834
Seen a few of these
scenarios first hand

22:14.917 --> 22:17.667
and they are right ugly.

22:25.750 --> 22:27.959
So this Ted guy,
Rose's boyfriend?

22:28.041 --> 22:29.250
Dead and gone.

22:29.333 --> 22:30.417
Still might be the doer.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.125
Aced Billie
for eyeing his girl.

22:32.208 --> 22:33.834
Happy birthday, Will.

22:33.917 --> 22:35.250
Yeah, yeah.

22:35.333 --> 22:37.667
Give yourself a present,
man.
Go see her tonight.

22:37.750 --> 22:40.583
- Who?
- Lena. Singer at this club.

22:40.667 --> 22:42.000
I'm staying in tonight.

22:42.083 --> 22:44.875
I'll go with you.
Wingman.

22:44.959 --> 22:47.667
Forget it. Well, got cigars
and guitars at home.

22:47.750 --> 22:49.750
That's all I need.

22:49.834 --> 22:51.500
A Celia Watson dropped this off.

22:52.542 --> 22:54.417
Mementos from Doc Win's?

22:54.500 --> 22:56.333
(Scotty)
'Literary magazines.'

22:56.417 --> 22:58.041
(Will)
"To Rose."

22:58.125 --> 23:00.208
"An original poem
by Billie Doucette."

23:00.291 --> 23:03.834
Maybe something in one of these
gives us a clue to how she died.

23:03.917 --> 23:05.709
(Nick)
'So we got
to make sense of'

23:05.792 --> 23:08.583
"Oh, ripest
fruit, pink and hidden

23:08.667 --> 23:11.333
"I've traveled wet,
sweaty miles to find you."

23:13.583 --> 23:16.208
Sounds like Billie
visited Rose's school again.

23:17.792 --> 23:21.500
(Lilly)
'"To Rose,
whose breathing is blooming.'

23:21.583 --> 23:23.542
"School bell

23:25.709 --> 23:28.709

"At the bell, I'm born again
through the Earth aching.

23:41.500 --> 23:45.542
"Moon-faced girl,
you are the only one I see."

23:50.250 --> 23:52.333
Sounds like
Billie was smitten.

23:52.417 --> 23:54.291
(Will)
'What about Rose?'

23:54.375 --> 23:56.041
She said
they were just friends.

23:56.125 --> 23:58.834
Well, this makes it sound
like more than that.

23:58.917 --> 24:02.500
'"Those three words I
have never heard together..'

24:02.583 --> 24:05.417

<i>"Then, baby, yes..</i>

24:37.458 --> 24:38.917
<i>...I love you, too."</i>

24:45.291 --> 24:46.792
Rose told
Billie she loved her.

24:46.875 --> 24:49.041
We sure these aren't
just Billie's fantasies?

24:49.125 --> 24:52.125
She said it was her truest
self she wrote in her poems.

24:52.208 --> 24:55.125
Okay, well,
this one ain't pretty.

24:55.208 --> 24:57.125
Date on it.
August 1932.

24:57.208 --> 24:59.583
(Will)
'Close to when
Billie disappeared.'

24:59.667 --> 25:01.667
What's it called, Nicky?

25:01.750 --> 25:03.458
"My Body Broken."

25:07.667 --> 25:09.667
<i>"Tired and..</i>

25:41.083 --> 25:45.000
<i>all night to dance</i>
<i>with his girl again."</i>

25:51.375 --> 25:54.125
Someone beat up Billie,
left her for dead.

25:54.208 --> 25:56.291
Someone whose girl she stole.

25:56.375 --> 25:58.834
Possible Billie stole
a lot of girls in her day.

25:58.917 --> 26:02.041
And she calls him
"lead-footed,"
like he can't move his feet.

26:02.125 --> 26:03.875
Maybe dead Ted.

26:03.959 --> 26:05.291
The bad dancer.

26:05.375 --> 26:07.125
Rose didn't tell us
Billie got beat up over her.

26:07.208 --> 26:09.250
She didn't mention
love poems, either.

26:09.333 --> 26:10.959
Didn't want to own up?

26:11.041 --> 26:12.625
I can't picture
my grandma owning up

26:12.709 --> 26:14.917
to something like this.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.500
Back to the Big Apple.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.542
Best friends.
That's what we were.

26:29.583 --> 26:30.667
That's all?

26:32.500 --> 26:34.333
Rose, someone
hurt Billie pretty
bad

26:34.417 --> 26:37.667
a few nights before she
died.
That your boyfriend, Ted?

26:40.166 --> 26:41.417
Yes.

26:41.500 --> 26:44.083
All 'cause you and
Billie were "friends," huh?

26:46.709 --> 26:49.291
(Lilly)
'Rose, she wrote
you love poems.'

26:52.083 --> 26:54.917
- Do you have them?
- Yeah.

26:58.834 --> 27:00.458
I'm a great grandmother.

27:02.417 --> 27:03.750
My family doesn't know.

27:03.834 --> 27:06.792
We're talking to
you, not your family.

27:09.792 --> 27:12.000
I was 17.

27:12.083 --> 27:13.291
I didn't know what it was.

27:13.375 --> 27:15.166
I just knew
I wanted to be around her.

27:17.709 --> 27:19.917
You had
feelings for her?

27:23.500 --> 27:25.208
There's a book in my desk.

27:25.291 --> 27:26.792
Uh, the drawer on the left..

27:29.041 --> 27:30.417
...with the violet cover.

27:31.917 --> 27:34.250
'Writings from
my teenage years.'

27:40.250 --> 27:41.709
And you're a poet, too.

27:41.792 --> 27:43.041
Oh, just that summer.

27:44.166 --> 27:45.583
I tried
to write my own poems.

27:45.667 --> 27:47.458
I was trying to
be just like Billie.

27:47.542 --> 27:48.625
I was terrible,
of course.

27:49.917 --> 27:52.583
"I came up
from the dark without
you

27:52.667 --> 27:54.917
"And every day since
has been in shadow."

27:58.917 --> 28:01.709
I thought Billie
brought me out of the dark..

28:03.709 --> 28:04.959
...showed me the light.

28:06.417 --> 28:08.834
What happened
when Ted beat her up?

28:11.709 --> 28:14.333
It made me
realize
how much I felt.

28:31.834 --> 28:33.667
You think
he broke anything, Billie?

28:36.542 --> 28:37.959
Look at me.

28:46.792 --> 28:49.375
He told me I come near
you again, he'll kill me.

28:49.458 --> 28:50.500
No.

28:50.583 --> 28:52.792
But I gotta come
near you, Rose.

28:52.875 --> 28:54.875
He won't
kill you. It's crazy.

28:54.959 --> 28:56.375
Don't you see
how it goes?

28:56.458 --> 28:57.875
It ain't easy for us.

29:05.667 --> 29:07.834
(Rose)
'Hold still.'

29:07.917 --> 29:09.250
Hold still, will ya?

29:17.083 --> 29:19.500
It's okay. It's okay.

29:29.709 --> 29:31.750
I got a plan
so we can be together.

29:33.083 --> 29:35.291
We'll go to New York.

29:35.375 --> 29:37.709
- We ain't got no money.
- Sure, we do.

29:39.500 --> 29:40.834
Look around.

29:42.250 --> 29:43.583
We got lots.

30:14.083 --> 30:16.750
After that,
I knew Curtis would kill me

30:16.834 --> 30:18.375
so we, we had to go.

30:19.875 --> 30:21.542
(Lilly)
'To New York.'

30:21.625 --> 30:23.208
That was the plan.

30:23.291 --> 30:25.375
'Billie was going
to take the truck and
liquor'

30:25.458 --> 30:26.625
'pick me up at school.'

30:26.709 --> 30:28.333
But she never made it?

30:31.792 --> 30:33.875
I took a bus to
New York in the morning.

30:33.959 --> 30:35.583
I tried to find her.

30:37.875 --> 30:41.125
Rose, why were you
so afraid of your brother?

30:41.208 --> 30:44.834
After our parents died
Curtis became fixated on me.

30:44.917 --> 30:48.709
He, he wanted us to
be together forever.

30:48.792 --> 30:50.625
He never would
have let me go.

30:52.125 --> 30:54.458
And you think he caught
Billie stealing the truck?

30:56.834 --> 30:58.291
What would he do to her?

31:01.625 --> 31:04.375
If that happened..

31:04.458 --> 31:06.458
...I'm sure she would
have been killed.

31:19.500 --> 31:21.792
My sister's dead.

31:21.875 --> 31:25.291
No, she's
in New York. Alive.

31:25.375 --> 31:26.542
You got it wrong.

31:26.625 --> 31:28.542
How would
you know, Curtis?

31:28.625 --> 31:30.375
You lost touch in '32.

31:32.125 --> 31:33.792
I just know is all.

31:35.709 --> 31:37.750
Answer me a hypothetical.

31:37.834 --> 31:40.208
'Back in the day when
you weren't so sweet'

31:40.291 --> 31:43.458
what would you do if you caught
someone liftin' your moonshine?

31:43.542 --> 31:44.625
Shoot 'em.

31:44.709 --> 31:46.417
Did you shoot Billie Doucette?

31:49.041 --> 31:51.208
I don't know who that is.

31:51.291 --> 31:52.625
Sure you do.

31:54.208 --> 31:58.417
She broke into your shed,
stole your hooch, your truck

31:58.500 --> 32:02.500
you chased her, shot at
her, ran her off a bridge.

32:02.583 --> 32:06.500
That's poppycock.

32:13.583 --> 32:16.667
What about someone
stealing your sister?

32:16.750 --> 32:18.291
What would you do to them?

32:21.625 --> 32:23.208
Watch that mouth.

32:23.291 --> 32:25.750
Billie Doucette becoming
a little more vivid to ya
now?

32:31.166 --> 32:33.667
I didn't shoot that thing.

32:33.750 --> 32:36.333
- What's that?
- The one poisoned my Rose.

32:36.417 --> 32:38.333
Aimed to kill her, but..

32:41.333 --> 32:42.834
...Rose had to step in.

32:57.125 --> 32:58.250
What the hell
are you doin'?

32:58.333 --> 33:01.542
- Lookin' for leaks.
- Stop it!

33:01.625 --> 33:03.250
I caught
myself a thief, Rose!

33:03.333 --> 33:04.959
Curtis, leave her alone!

33:05.041 --> 33:07.417
You gone bughouse?
She's stealin' from us.

33:07.500 --> 33:08.667
I love her!

33:10.208 --> 33:11.333
You what?

33:15.792 --> 33:18.041
Love her.
Please let her go.

33:19.875 --> 33:22.375
Better watch
what you're sayin', Rosie.

33:22.458 --> 33:24.041
You don't
know what she
is.

33:24.125 --> 33:26.792
Yes, I do. I know it
through and through.

33:26.875 --> 33:28.250
Don't you say that to me!

33:29.667 --> 33:33.583
No. Oh, Lord. No.
I tried to raise you right!

33:33.667 --> 33:36.000
I tried,
but you slippin' off.

33:36.083 --> 33:37.583
I'm your heart, Rose.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.083
'I know that
you know that.'

33:39.166 --> 33:42.000
But you let this
thing get in your mind

33:42.083 --> 33:44.000
like a maggot.

33:44.083 --> 33:45.041
It's alright, baby.

33:45.125 --> 33:46.333
Don't you talk to her!

33:50.125 --> 33:52.166
You gotta choice or what.

33:52.250 --> 33:55.417
You cannot be loyal
to this thing..

33:55.500 --> 33:57.500
...and be part
of this Collins family.

33:58.834 --> 34:00.542
- Rose!
- 'Which one?'

34:02.166 --> 34:03.667
Blood or this?

34:05.709 --> 34:07.375
Me or this?

34:11.667 --> 34:13.959
'I'm gonna put her
outta her misery.'

34:14.041 --> 34:16.959
Now, go get my gun
outta the truck. Now!

34:17.875 --> 34:19.250
Go get it!

34:31.959 --> 34:34.208
You're not my family,
you sorry son of a bitch.

34:35.208 --> 34:37.500
Billie, get in the truck.

34:43.458 --> 34:44.709
Rose.

34:47.417 --> 34:48.500
Curtis.

34:50.875 --> 34:52.083
I guess goodbye.

35:15.083 --> 35:18.792
I took my Plymouth
and drove after 'em.

35:19.959 --> 35:22.500
- Shot at 'em?
- Emptied my gun..

35:24.166 --> 35:25.542
...but they kept on.

35:25.625 --> 35:28.000
So how did the truck
end up in the river?

35:28.083 --> 35:31.709
Bridge was out
'cause of the rains.

35:31.792 --> 35:35.458
I saw the sign, slowed down.

35:35.542 --> 35:36.792
And the girls?

35:38.375 --> 35:41.959
Hit the bridge,
goin' full-bore.

35:43.208 --> 35:44.542
'That's..'

35:44.625 --> 35:48.041
...That's what's
scramblin' my brains, see.

35:48.125 --> 35:51.709
You sayin' Rose is alive.

35:51.792 --> 35:53.834
'Cause she
was in that truck?

35:53.917 --> 35:55.542
(Curtis)
'They both were.'

35:55.625 --> 36:01.834
And I, I saw it go
off of that bridge.

36:17.542 --> 36:20.250
I don't know why,
exactly.
The last couple of days

36:20.333 --> 36:22.208
I feel short
of breath at
home.

36:26.083 --> 36:27.458
I know that feeling.

36:29.667 --> 36:31.542
'Fresh air helps.'

36:31.625 --> 36:33.250
(Scotty)
'We talked to your brother..'

36:33.333 --> 36:35.750
'...about your
theory he killed Billie.'

36:35.834 --> 36:37.291
He gave us something else.

36:37.375 --> 36:39.166
He told us you were
in the truck, Rose..

36:41.125 --> 36:42.583
...when it went
off the bridge.

36:42.667 --> 36:45.625
That's not
possible.
I would've died.

36:47.709 --> 36:49.291
Yet here you are.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.542
I was not in that truck.

36:55.709 --> 36:57.583
I was waiting for Billie.

36:57.667 --> 36:58.917
I was alone.

37:00.959 --> 37:02.625
Right.

37:02.709 --> 37:04.083
So there was no plan.

37:06.166 --> 37:08.458
- You never loved her.
- You never healed her.

37:08.542 --> 37:11.333
You never "Came up
from the dark without her?"

37:14.542 --> 37:15.709
Rose..

37:20.291 --> 37:22.959
"Came up from
the dark without you

37:23.041 --> 37:25.667
"And every day since
has been in shadow."

37:28.709 --> 37:30.625
Dark is the water.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.291
This is about
the accident, isn't it?

37:36.583 --> 37:38.875
(Scotty)
'You gave us this poem, Rose.'

37:38.959 --> 37:40.500
'You want to tell us.'

37:40.583 --> 37:45.458
Water, love,
guilt, death.

37:47.291 --> 37:48.625
I'm no writer.

37:50.583 --> 37:52.834
But she was.

37:52.917 --> 37:54.417
And that's
why you wrote this..

37:55.667 --> 37:56.959
...for Billie.

38:01.041 --> 38:04.500
I wondered if it was wrong.
the feelings I had for her.

38:05.500 --> 38:06.625
(Lilly)
'No.'

38:08.417 --> 38:11.250
It was just
the wrong time.

38:13.583 --> 38:15.375
All these years..

38:18.458 --> 38:20.709
...I've carried her with me.

38:20.792 --> 38:23.458
What happened
that night? In the truck?

38:29.041 --> 38:31.500
I betrayed my girl.

38:33.792 --> 38:34.875
How?

38:38.709 --> 38:39.959
I lived.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.875
- Baby, hold tight.
- He's gonna kill us!

38:59.917 --> 39:01.417
He's gonna follow us
all the way to New
York

39:01.500 --> 39:03.000
and track
us down like
dogs.

39:03.083 --> 39:04.208
Let me out, then.

39:04.291 --> 39:06.917
'It's me he's after.
You blow on outta here.'

39:07.000 --> 39:08.250
No, he'll kill you.

39:08.333 --> 39:09.709
I'm not scared, Rose.

39:10.583 --> 39:12.291
No. We can make it.

39:20.458 --> 39:23.417
- It's closed off.
- No. No. No.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.875
We ain't gettin' away
from him now, Rose.

39:25.959 --> 39:28.667
I know. But he's not
taking you away from me.

39:40.083 --> 39:41.166
You love me?

39:41.250 --> 39:42.709
Baby, what
are you doing?

39:45.917 --> 39:47.208
I'm your girl, right?

39:47.291 --> 39:49.083
You're my girl
and I love you.

39:52.208 --> 39:54.333
How'd you like
to love me forever?

39:58.333 --> 39:59.458
Yes.

40:02.125 --> 40:03.667
- Okay.
- Okay.

40:03.750 --> 40:06.375
Alright, then
that's what we'll do.

40:59.709 --> 41:01.208
Billie!
