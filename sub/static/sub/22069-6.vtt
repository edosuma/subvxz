WEBVTT

00:12.080 --> 00:13.647
You're the one
they're looking for?

00:14.448 --> 00:15.449
I'm innocent.

00:16.750 --> 00:17.751
Move!

00:29.663 --> 00:30.731
This way.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.084
You're going to shoot me?

00:50.118 --> 00:51.352
Or are you going to turn me in?

00:52.720 --> 00:54.755
Who says I only
got two choices?

00:59.593 --> 01:00.594
You know,

01:01.695 --> 01:05.299
there's only two things
in this world that I hate.

01:08.636 --> 01:09.703
My ex,

01:10.771 --> 01:11.772
and the law.

01:16.009 --> 01:18.312
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

01:19.247 --> 01:20.448
You want a friend?

01:25.253 --> 01:27.621
I could sure use one
right about now.

01:29.623 --> 01:30.658
Larry Novo.

01:35.296 --> 01:37.431
Got some dry clothes
back there.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.868
Go on, I won't look at you.

01:54.148 --> 01:55.516
So where are you headed?

01:57.751 --> 01:58.752
Boston.

02:00.521 --> 02:01.889
Lucky you.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.757
I'm Georgia bound.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.130
You decent?

02:18.939 --> 02:20.140
Thank you.

02:21.542 --> 02:24.212
You can get some rest
back there.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.879
I'll wake you
when we're close.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.452
I ain't gonna hurt ya.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.294
It's your call.

02:40.328 --> 02:42.630
You got 10 seconds
to make it, though.

02:45.866 --> 02:46.900
Okay.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.236
All right.

03:34.782 --> 03:36.484
These marks here,

03:36.517 --> 03:38.786
along the orbital bone,

03:38.819 --> 03:40.120
they're blade marks.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.422
The eyelids.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.156
Our killer
cut them off.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.492
Sloppily.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.427
My guess, this is one
of the first victims,

03:46.460 --> 03:48.028
maybe the first. From decomp,

03:48.061 --> 03:51.765
this body predates the ones
we liked Harlow for by years.

03:51.799 --> 03:54.268
CROWN: The location ties
to Emily's childhood.

03:54.302 --> 03:56.036
That's what changes
everything here.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.538
Look,

03:57.571 --> 04:00.608
we need to start
facing some facts.

04:00.641 --> 04:03.210
One, since Harlow told you
where to find Emily,

04:03.243 --> 04:05.178
we know he had a person

04:05.212 --> 04:07.815
or persons working with him
on the outside.

04:08.582 --> 04:09.583
Two,

04:10.318 --> 04:11.819
Semerov shows up dead

04:11.852 --> 04:16.089
with Harlow's signature
and Emily's DNA.

04:16.123 --> 04:17.291
So we've been looking
for a killer

04:17.325 --> 04:20.528
who's a link between
Harlow and Semerov.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.564
That would be Emily.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.735
And now...

04:27.768 --> 04:30.671
Now we have another body
with Harlow's signature

04:30.704 --> 04:32.473
in a grave site
that ties to Emily.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.875
A site she led us to.

04:35.443 --> 04:36.777
You're saying that

04:36.810 --> 04:39.913
Emily was Harlow's person
on the outside all along.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.317
I'm saying

04:43.351 --> 04:45.386
it sure as hell looks that way.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.623
Keep working the forest scene.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.859
And I want to know more
about Yorick here.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.160
Start with his name.

04:53.193 --> 04:54.528
Roger that.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.299
Nick.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.702
Emily wanted that
initial case so bad,

05:01.735 --> 05:02.836
you remember that?

05:02.870 --> 05:06.674
Maybe we need to go right back
to the very beginning.

05:06.707 --> 05:09.810
What is the earliest their
two paths could have crossed?

05:09.843 --> 05:11.845
When did Harlow first
become a suspect?

06:47.140 --> 06:48.141
Jack?

08:18.732 --> 08:21.201
Come on, Jackie,
where's your password?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.062
OPERATOR: 911,
how can I help you?

11:02.095 --> 11:03.864
Please,
you have to come quickly!

11:44.772 --> 11:47.707
FEMALE OFFICER: Police!
Open up, Mr. Byrne.

11:47.741 --> 11:49.777
MALE OFFICER:
Is everybody all right in here?

11:49.810 --> 11:51.378
FEMALE OFFICER: Open up!

11:55.682 --> 11:57.417
MALE OFFICER: Jack Byrne?

11:57.450 --> 11:59.953
FEMALE OFFICER: Jack,
Jack Byrne.

12:19.306 --> 12:20.307
Shit!

13:18.231 --> 13:19.399
CROWN:
What's up?

13:19.432 --> 13:22.702
Hey, do you have
Gregory Nash's contact info?

13:22.735 --> 13:23.803
CROWN: Yeah, sure, why?

13:23.837 --> 13:26.239
I'm trying to get a hold
of the witness

13:26.273 --> 13:28.441
that first mentioned
Harlow to us.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.809
Uh...

13:30.443 --> 13:31.544
Sorry...

13:32.179 --> 13:34.014
Julie Carter.

13:34.047 --> 13:38.451
And there's only Carter's
statement in the files.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.688
I figured that Nash is running
the field office.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.390
CROWN: Yeah, I have
what he left us with

13:43.423 --> 13:44.925
when he retired, so...

13:44.958 --> 13:46.293
I'll send over the info.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.327
All right, thanks.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.999
WARREN: Go! Go, go, go!
On the left!

13:52.032 --> 13:54.201
On the left! You got him!
There, there.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.602
And the other one!
Go ahead...

13:57.237 --> 13:58.571
Come in!

13:58.605 --> 13:59.772
And again!

13:59.806 --> 14:01.041
Hi, guys.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.442
Time to go.

14:03.476 --> 14:04.511
Can I finish my level?

14:04.544 --> 14:06.113
No, it's time to go, Flynn.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.316
I'll see you soon, kiddo.

14:10.783 --> 14:12.219
Come on, get your stuff.

14:15.288 --> 14:18.025
Honey, can you, uh,
wait outside a moment?

14:18.058 --> 14:19.960
I just need to talk
with Grandpa.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.900
Thanks for
bringing him by, Alice.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.674
Warren, did you talk
to him about Emily?

14:34.707 --> 14:35.775
Of course I did.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.177
He needs to know
his mother's innocent.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.246
This mess will be
cleared up soon,

14:39.279 --> 14:41.214
and everything can
go back to normal.

14:44.017 --> 14:46.353
We need to be careful
how we are handling Flynn.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.122
I'm talking
about his expectations.

14:49.156 --> 14:51.391
Because if it turns out what
they are saying is true...

14:51.424 --> 14:52.425
They?

14:53.093 --> 14:54.827
Are you part of "they," Alice?

14:54.861 --> 14:56.163
Warren, I'm not here
to get into this.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.764
I'm just talking about Flynn.

14:57.797 --> 14:59.166
So am I.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.633
If you're poisoning him
against her...

15:00.667 --> 15:01.834
Poisoning?

15:01.868 --> 15:04.004
No, Warren, I'm not.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.108
I'll bring him by next week.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.119
Good timing, Durand.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.555
Good to see you, Nash.

15:23.756 --> 15:24.992
NASH: Good to see you, buddy.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.693
Why don't you give
young blood here the bill?

15:26.726 --> 15:27.794
No, no.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.329
You look good, Nash.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.965
It's amazing what
not getting your balls
busted around the clock

15:31.999 --> 15:33.300
can do for you.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.702
You look like you've only
aged about 30 years.

15:35.735 --> 15:36.769
That's pretty good.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.038
Thanks for meeting me.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.906
Well, if I can help bring
this thing to a safe end,

15:39.939 --> 15:40.974
I'm happy to try.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.642
I wanted to ask
about Julie Carter.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.877
Well, she's the one
that first put us on to Harlow
as a suspect.

15:44.911 --> 15:48.048
Yeah. That's right.
I was looking through
the old files.

15:48.081 --> 15:51.118
Carter was a patron at the bar
where the first body,

15:51.151 --> 15:53.386
the Smith girl,
was last seen.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.756
Carter said she saw Harlow
leave with the Smith girl.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.425
So, what's your question?

15:58.458 --> 16:01.294
You ever speak with Carter?
Take her statement?

16:01.328 --> 16:02.362
No.

16:02.395 --> 16:03.496
No?

16:03.530 --> 16:05.198
Why? Emily found Carter.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.266
That was the big break.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.401
Uh, I know,
but I can't ask Radford,

16:08.435 --> 16:10.037
and there's no mention
in his reports

16:10.070 --> 16:11.538
of ever having
spoken to Carter.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.540
Well, that's because
he never met her either.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.276
What?

16:16.309 --> 16:19.479
Julie Carter OD'ed a few days
after talking to Emily.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.214
Heroin.

16:21.248 --> 16:22.649
Let me get this straight.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.552
Only one person on earth

16:25.585 --> 16:28.655
questioned the witness who
first gave us the name Harlow?

16:29.822 --> 16:31.291
And that person was Emily.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.028
Jesus.

17:19.005 --> 17:20.207
You've got eyes
on the father, right?

17:21.508 --> 17:22.509
Okay.

17:23.110 --> 17:24.311
MAN: Detective.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.879
Take a look at this.

17:26.913 --> 17:28.581
(SMACKING AND WOMAN
SCREAMING IN VIDEO)

17:40.793 --> 17:42.061
No, no, no!

17:42.095 --> 17:44.197
Don't touch it.

17:44.231 --> 17:47.467
Calling Judge Ramos
for a 2037 warrant.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.605
MAN: She opened this file
with these images,

18:25.638 --> 18:27.640
after she saw
this text exchange.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.342
TOMMY: And we know
who this Violet is, right?

18:29.376 --> 18:30.743
Ran the number,
it's a burner.

18:31.811 --> 18:32.979
But that's not all.

18:33.012 --> 18:34.614
I found this.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.284
TOMMY: This account
was set up right before
Emily Byrne vanished.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.352
Yeah, and it's not his
only bank account.

18:39.386 --> 18:40.887
Look, he has another
bank account,

18:40.920 --> 18:43.089
for his checks,
bills et cetera.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.258
This one was funded
seven years ago

18:45.292 --> 18:47.126
with several large
cash deposits.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.562
And I can't trace the cash
to his income.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.664
Where does the money
come from then?

18:51.698 --> 18:53.833
You're gonna have to do some
of the work here, Detective.

18:57.904 --> 18:58.905
Yeah.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.629
Hey, where are you going?

19:22.662 --> 19:24.364
I don't know. Ask Mom.

19:43.149 --> 19:44.617
I'm going to my sister's.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.358
When were you going
to tell me?

19:51.391 --> 19:52.992
I was going to leave you
a letter.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.227
Alice.

19:54.861 --> 19:55.862
What is this?

19:57.163 --> 19:58.465
I'm pregnant.

20:07.106 --> 20:08.308
Please don't.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.310
I'm sorry.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.412
I'm sorry.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.483
We can work this out.
Let's sit and talk.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.651
Our whole life together,

20:18.685 --> 20:20.453
it's just a consolation,
isn't it?

20:22.221 --> 20:23.456
Admit it.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.592
I'm only in the picture
because she left it.

20:26.859 --> 20:27.860
This "us..."

20:28.928 --> 20:30.463
This was never your choice.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.565
Not your first choice.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.901
This is you settling.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.102
And I can't be that.

20:36.135 --> 20:38.305
I was...
I was confused. Um,

20:39.506 --> 20:40.873
please, I need you
to understand...

20:40.907 --> 20:42.008
I do, Nick!

20:43.343 --> 20:45.445
I understand it all now.

20:45.478 --> 20:46.779
And I should have sooner.

20:48.114 --> 20:50.049
Just didn't want to.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.018
I thought my past was
behind us.

20:54.053 --> 20:55.588
Then it came back.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.326
Out of nowhere.

21:02.061 --> 21:03.696
This is what I want now.

21:06.699 --> 21:07.834
This is my life.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.439
You... You and me and...

21:14.941 --> 21:16.476
Our children.

21:21.714 --> 21:24.050
I'm done with the past,
I swear to you.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.385
I think you want to be,

21:26.453 --> 21:27.687
but you won't be.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.089
Not till there's closure.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.558
Find her, Nick.

21:31.591 --> 21:32.592
End this.

21:33.960 --> 21:34.961
And then we'll talk.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.987
Tommy Gibbs, Boston PD.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.389
We had an appointment.

22:05.057 --> 22:07.560
I want to talk
about Jack Byrne.

22:07.594 --> 22:09.128
He hasn't worked here in years.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.329
I know.

22:10.363 --> 22:11.498
Why was he let go?

22:11.531 --> 22:13.666
He showed up drunk
to a surgery.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.067
I think that about covers it.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.135
Then you set in motion

22:16.168 --> 22:17.837
the revoking of
his medical license.

22:17.870 --> 22:18.838
It was my duty.

22:18.871 --> 22:21.874
I read the report you
filed for the board.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.209
You mentioned absences.

22:23.242 --> 22:24.744
It goes with the territory.

22:25.412 --> 22:26.846
The disease.

22:26.879 --> 22:27.880
Alcoholism.

22:29.215 --> 22:30.917
I do have compassion for him.

22:30.950 --> 22:34.754
What he went through,
the sister, his father.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.556
He'd vanish
for a week at a time.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.558
It just became untenable.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.292
He came into some money.

22:40.326 --> 22:43.530
Sometime prior to March 2011,

22:43.563 --> 22:44.897
that's when
he was working here.

22:44.931 --> 22:47.467
We're certain those funds came
from another source,

22:47.500 --> 22:48.868
not his regular income.

22:48.901 --> 22:52.371
There was some
malfeasance that came to light,

22:52.405 --> 22:54.140
but nothing I could ever prove.

22:54.173 --> 22:55.207
I'm listening.

22:55.241 --> 22:57.343
Someone was embezzling
from the hospital.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.211
Medical device orders.

22:59.245 --> 23:01.380
We'd pay for things
we'd never receive.

23:02.515 --> 23:05.518
Jack is now working
for a medical device wholesaler.

23:09.856 --> 23:10.890
Thank you.

25:21.287 --> 25:22.989
WOMAN: I got friends inside.

25:35.101 --> 25:36.402
Hey.

25:36.435 --> 25:38.204
You're not going to believe
what's on Jack Byrne's computer.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.305
Jack?

25:39.338 --> 25:42.208
Yeah. He's into
some sick shit, man.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.043
Like bondage porn.

25:44.076 --> 25:45.645
Water torture, drowning.

25:45.678 --> 25:46.746
That doesn't mean anything.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.781
He embezzled funds from work.

25:48.815 --> 25:52.184
Built himself up
a little slush fund

25:52.218 --> 25:53.552
right before she vanished.

25:53.586 --> 25:54.787
Jesus.

25:54.821 --> 25:56.856
You connect that money
to the cabin or to the tank?

25:56.889 --> 25:58.925
No, it might be
a good time to think

25:58.958 --> 26:01.493
that maybe she didn't break
into his apartment for help.

26:01.527 --> 26:02.829
She suspects him.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.731
Well, he was the one
that sent us to that forest.

26:05.497 --> 26:06.633
That grave.

26:06.666 --> 26:09.268
The last person
she suspected ended up dead.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.071
We need to find Jack now.

26:50.342 --> 26:53.412
What are you doing here?
Semerov's people think
you've killed him!

26:53.445 --> 26:54.480
Where's Violet going?

26:54.513 --> 26:55.948
Why?

26:55.982 --> 26:57.684
I just need a minute with her,
and I need you to arrange it.

26:57.717 --> 26:58.818
Now, where is she going?

26:58.851 --> 27:00.720
She's in the webcam room.

27:06.525 --> 27:08.527
Stay here.
I'll handle the boss.

27:08.560 --> 27:09.762
All right.

27:36.455 --> 27:37.790
You gotta go now.

27:37.824 --> 27:38.858
Take some money.

27:38.891 --> 27:40.326
No no, you've
done enough. No.

27:40.359 --> 27:42.561
There's a camera over your
head when you walk in.

27:42.594 --> 27:43.730
Okay, go. Go!

27:43.763 --> 27:45.031
Be careful.

28:06.552 --> 28:07.920
EMILY: Turn the mic off.

28:12.124 --> 28:13.259
Keep dancing.

28:15.361 --> 28:16.695
Keep dancing.

28:25.571 --> 28:27.373
Is that the camera
they watch you from?

28:28.640 --> 28:29.942
Yes.

28:31.477 --> 28:32.845
You know who I am?

28:35.614 --> 28:37.216
Yes.

28:41.187 --> 28:43.122
We're going to talk
about Jack.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.594
When did you guys
start seeing each other?

28:50.362 --> 28:51.397
EMILY: You answer quickly,

28:51.430 --> 28:53.332
you answer truthfully,
and you won't get hurt.

28:53.365 --> 28:54.834
Eight years ago.

28:54.867 --> 28:56.635
EMILY: He always been violent?

28:56.668 --> 28:58.470
I saw the show
in your apartment.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.273
I don't judge.

29:02.674 --> 29:04.376
Did he ever mention me?

29:06.278 --> 29:07.746
Sometimes.

29:09.982 --> 29:13.853
Look, we didn't see each other
for a long time.

29:13.886 --> 29:16.422
He only called me again
a few weeks ago.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.126
What day?

29:24.430 --> 29:25.965
You were on the news.

29:26.432 --> 29:28.234
They just found you.

29:28.267 --> 29:32.371
I remember because Jack
was talking about it
that night.

29:32.404 --> 29:35.007
You said you guys stopped
seeing each other for how long?

29:35.041 --> 29:37.343
When we first met
we would see each other

29:38.610 --> 29:40.412
once a week.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.614
That lasted
for about two years.

29:42.648 --> 29:43.950
Then he stopped,

29:43.983 --> 29:45.184
I don't know why.

29:46.485 --> 29:48.420
For how long did it stop?

29:48.454 --> 29:50.456
For about six years.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.996
I need you to think very
clearly right now.

30:01.300 --> 30:04.971
Did he stop
seeing you somewhere
around March, 2011?

30:05.004 --> 30:06.873
Right after I was abducted.

30:09.508 --> 30:10.509
Yes.

30:13.245 --> 30:14.280
Are we done here?

30:14.313 --> 30:17.316
Did he ever take you out
to a cabin on I95?

30:18.717 --> 30:19.986
Did he ever mention it?

30:20.019 --> 30:20.853
No!

30:20.887 --> 30:22.855
(MAN KNOCKING AT DOOR,
SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

30:22.889 --> 30:23.990
Don't say anything.

30:38.070 --> 30:39.071
Shit.

30:45.011 --> 30:47.079
Keys! Keys! Car Keys!

30:47.113 --> 30:48.114
Come on!

30:59.691 --> 31:01.093
Move! Move!

31:01.127 --> 31:02.128
Go!

31:08.767 --> 31:09.969
Emily!

32:13.332 --> 32:14.900
Talk to me.
MALE OFFICER:
Hey, Tommy,

32:14.933 --> 32:16.602
you said you wanted
to hear anything, right?

32:16.635 --> 32:18.037
Yeah. What do you got?

32:18.070 --> 32:22.241
Long shot,
some guy on a porn site
web cam said he saw Byrne.

32:23.609 --> 32:24.977
Porn?

32:25.011 --> 32:27.813
Yeah, said he was
watching a webcam show
when Byrne crashed the party.

32:27.846 --> 32:29.415
Sounds crazy, I know, but,

32:29.448 --> 32:31.650
you know, you said
anything so...

32:31.683 --> 32:32.684
Okay.

32:33.585 --> 32:34.453
What was the web site?

32:34.486 --> 32:36.155
I'll send it to you
right now.

32:36.188 --> 32:38.024
Okay, check your e-mail.

32:52.571 --> 32:53.572
Wait.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.614
It's a Semerov site.

33:05.051 --> 33:07.619
All units to 429 Boardman
in Eastie.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.021
We got a Byrne sighting.

33:09.921 --> 33:11.557
Come on, let's go, people!
Let's go!

33:13.192 --> 33:14.760
What else did she say?

33:14.793 --> 33:16.928
She asked about timing,

33:16.962 --> 33:18.964
when we saw each other,
when we started,

33:18.997 --> 33:21.133
when we stopped,
when we started again.

33:21.167 --> 33:22.201
Things like that.

33:22.234 --> 33:23.502
What did you tell her?

33:23.535 --> 33:25.704
VIOLET: What do you think
I told her, Jack?

33:28.940 --> 33:30.008
I spoke with Nash.

33:30.042 --> 33:31.343
CROWN: And?

33:31.377 --> 33:33.445
The witness who first
gave us Harlow as a suspect...

33:33.479 --> 33:35.581
Emily was the only agent
to ever speak with her

33:35.614 --> 33:37.015
before she OD'ed.

33:38.284 --> 33:39.918
You think she fabricated
the statement?

33:39.951 --> 33:41.220
I don't know what to think.

33:41.253 --> 33:42.721
Well, if she did, I was wrong.

33:42.754 --> 33:44.956
She wasn't working with Harlow,
she framed him.

33:44.990 --> 33:46.192
There's more.

33:46.225 --> 33:48.427
BPD turned up a bunch
of stuff on Jack.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.629
It's all circumstantial
at this stage,

33:50.662 --> 33:51.797
but it doesn't look good.

33:51.830 --> 33:54.333
Oh, Christ, we're supposed
to be narrowing things down.

33:54.366 --> 33:55.201
Yeah.

33:55.234 --> 33:56.735
Hey, guys.
You need to see this.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.508
FEMALE AGENT:
Standby. We're receiving
body count footage

34:02.541 --> 34:04.210
from the Nottingham park
grave site.

34:04.243 --> 34:05.677
MALE AGENT:
We're setting up the camera.

34:05.711 --> 34:08.247
You're going to get a live
feed in just a few seconds.

34:30.502 --> 34:32.404
MALE AGENT 2:
There's two more over there!

34:33.705 --> 34:35.073
Come on. This way!

34:36.608 --> 34:38.277
Oh, my God, Jesus.

37:29.047 --> 37:31.417
AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
Please leave a message
at the tone.

37:40.359 --> 37:41.760
It's me...

37:43.495 --> 37:44.596
Jack.

37:49.167 --> 37:50.669
I'm with Mom.

37:52.871 --> 37:55.807
Maybe this is where
you think I should be.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.044
I don't have a lot of time.

37:59.077 --> 38:00.278
I'm hurt.

38:06.084 --> 38:08.587
I just want to see you
one more time.

38:11.022 --> 38:12.491
I need to know why.

38:15.260 --> 38:18.964
Please, just come.

39:18.457 --> 39:19.825
EMILY:
It's me...

39:21.960 --> 39:22.961
Jack.
