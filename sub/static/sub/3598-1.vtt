00:39.140 --> 00:41.659
Oh, man.

00:41.820 --> 00:44.659
- I am so wired.
- More so than usual?

00:44.820 --> 00:46.219
Way more.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.579
I made a model of centennial
last night complete with guests.

00:48.740 --> 00:49.739
I stayed up all night.

00:49.940 --> 00:52.379
I've got the entire thing
planned out, every detail.

00:52.540 --> 00:56.339
you didn't sleep?
you should have slept.

00:56.500 --> 00:58.179
I'm a freak, aren't I?

00:58.340 --> 01:00.779
No, you're just very... focused.

01:00.940 --> 01:04.619
Exactly. So what do you think
of my mom's red halter?

01:04.780 --> 01:08.139
For your interview today?
It's a little slutty.

01:08.300 --> 01:11.459
Let me rephrase. What do you think
Brad'll think of my mom's red halter?

01:11.620 --> 01:13.779
I think Brad has
better taste than that.

01:13.940 --> 01:16.619
Really?
Okay, see you in a minute.

01:35.540 --> 01:37.659
Got milk?

01:37.820 --> 01:39.259
Thanks a lot.
you're a lifesaver.

01:39.420 --> 01:41.579
- You're welcome.
- Sorry about that.

01:41.740 --> 01:43.619
- It's goat's milk.
- Uh-huh.

01:45.180 --> 01:49.139
Dad, bring the milk home.

01:49.300 --> 01:51.499
Come on, Dad. Come on.

01:55.340 --> 01:57.899
Dad, can I take the milk
off your hands?

01:58.060 --> 02:00.499
- Good morning, Chase.
- Good morning, Mrs. Maris.

02:00.660 --> 02:02.819
Mom, can I borrow
your red halter?

02:02.980 --> 02:04.339
Oh.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.699
Would you look at that?

02:05.860 --> 02:07.939
They'll be away at college next year.

02:08.100 --> 02:09.258
Time flies.

02:09.419 --> 02:12.579
Seems like only yesterday
they were practically living together

02:12.740 --> 02:14.459
in that old tree house.

02:14.620 --> 02:15.859
- Dad, milk.
- Mom.

02:16.020 --> 02:18.339
Seriously, you two used to do
everything together.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.859
What happened?

02:22.060 --> 02:24.419
Junior high happened.

02:27.060 --> 02:29.579
Hey! Whoo!

02:39.260 --> 02:41.419
Hi. How you doing?

02:41.580 --> 02:42.899
• If you told me to •

02:43.100 --> 02:46.699
• Well, I'd do anything •

02:46.860 --> 02:48.459
• And if I ever touched you... •

02:48.620 --> 02:49.859
• I'd die •

02:50.060 --> 02:52.899
• Oh, I could have said •

02:53.060 --> 02:57.579
• I wanted you
or told you something true •

02:57.780 --> 02:59.499
• If I really wanted you •

02:59.700 --> 03:01.379
• I'd lie •

03:02.660 --> 03:07.259
• And I told you
everything's well •

03:08.740 --> 03:10.699
• Yeah, I know
just what I'd say... •

03:10.860 --> 03:13.699
- Hi!
- • your Firebird is most amazing •

03:13.860 --> 03:16.419
• Turbo whoa-oh •

03:16.580 --> 03:18.299
• Teen •

03:27.940 --> 03:29.739
• Now she's at it again •

03:29.900 --> 03:33.379
• I see her every weekend •

03:33.540 --> 03:36.219
• Wish I had a dime
for every time •

03:36.380 --> 03:38.379
• Oh, I •

03:38.540 --> 03:40.419
• Coca-Cola
with a cigarette •

03:40.580 --> 03:43.579
• On a patio
with her hair still wet •

03:43.780 --> 03:45.859
• She's the girl
with the rocking horse •

03:46.020 --> 03:47.219
• On her blinds •

03:47.380 --> 03:50.099
• Oh, I know her •

03:50.260 --> 03:54.099
• Every time •

03:55.180 --> 03:57.099
• Yeah,
I know just what I'd say •

03:57.260 --> 03:59.779
• your Firebird is most amazing •

03:59.940 --> 04:02.659
• Turbo whoa-oh •

04:02.820 --> 04:05.859
• Teen •

04:06.020 --> 04:08.299
• But I won't mean it. •

04:32.780 --> 04:34.139
Wake up, Time Zone High.

04:34.300 --> 04:35.499
- Morning, Tom.
- Morning, Sue.

04:35.660 --> 04:38.459
Our top story: centennial.
Only two months to go.

04:38.620 --> 04:41.499
And as the 100th anniversary
of TZH approaches,

04:41.660 --> 04:43.659
- excitement mounts.
- That's right, Sue.

04:43.820 --> 04:45.899
And here to take
that excitement up a notch

04:46.060 --> 04:47.619
is a "Wake Up, Time Zone" special:

04:47.780 --> 04:51.259
Centennial... your 100-year event.

04:51.420 --> 04:53.339
In only six weeks,

04:53.500 --> 04:56.219
it will be exactly 100 years
since Timothy Zonin

04:56.380 --> 04:58.099
founded Timothy Zonin High.

04:58.260 --> 05:00.339
And both students
and alumni alike are preparing

05:00.500 --> 05:02.499
an unforgettable Centennial Week.

05:02.660 --> 05:06.699
Centennial Committee spokesperson
Nicole Maris expects a huge cro

05:06.860 --> 05:10.219
Our centennial bash is the culmination
of a weeklong series of events.

05:10.380 --> 05:12.419
It's gonna be the greatest night
of our lives.

05:12.620 --> 05:15.699
Something this big only comes along
once every hundred years.

05:15.860 --> 05:18.539
We're making the most of it
so you can make the most of it.

05:21.580 --> 05:23.619
So, where are we
on the senior class skit?

05:23.780 --> 05:26.859
- Are we doing the sculpture idea?
- Yes, it's a good idea.

05:27.020 --> 05:29.339
Nicole, how's the rest
of the budget looking?

05:29.500 --> 05:32.259
- $16,372...
- Good, we'll need it.

05:32.420 --> 05:35.299
Rupert and I are working
on a deal for a jumbo screen.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.219
- It's sick.
- Are parents invited or only alumni?

05:38.380 --> 05:41.859
Both. Tradition.
Everyone's invited.

05:43.220 --> 05:44.379
Why are we doing this again?

05:44.540 --> 05:45.899
- As a protest.
- Of what?

05:46.060 --> 05:47.379
- People, right?
- Sheep.

05:47.540 --> 05:49.779
Check, Dave.
We're doing this to protest sheep.

05:49.940 --> 05:51.739
And what specifically
about sheep do we object to?

05:51.900 --> 05:55.099
- Chase.
- General herding mentality.

05:56.580 --> 06:00.459
Man, look at 'em down there.
yeah, drink your mochaccinos.

06:00.620 --> 06:02.979
Sing along to Céline Dion.

06:07.420 --> 06:09.219
What?

06:11.260 --> 06:13.899
• And just outside
I can hear the sounds •

06:14.100 --> 06:17.739
- • Of the early morning street... •
- What's going on?!

06:17.940 --> 06:20.259
• And the hum
of the engines •

06:20.420 --> 06:22.259
• Of the cars on the street •

06:22.420 --> 06:25.059
• yeah, on the street •

06:25.220 --> 06:27.939
• And just outside
I can see my breath •

06:28.100 --> 06:30.099
- • In between the words... •
- Aw.

06:30.260 --> 06:32.219
• That fogs my spinning head •

06:32.380 --> 06:35.619
• This is the •

06:35.780 --> 06:39.019
• This is the same old story
of growing up and getting lost •

06:39.180 --> 06:41.099
• This is the same old story
of growing up •

06:41.260 --> 06:43.099
• And getting lost. •

06:47.940 --> 06:50.299
Sprinklers.

06:50.460 --> 06:53.179
you guys.

06:53.340 --> 06:54.939
Sprinklers.

06:55.140 --> 06:58.219
- Us guys.
- you got it.

06:58.380 --> 07:00.459
- Sprinklers.
- Exactly.

07:00.620 --> 07:03.219
- Us guys.
- That's right.

07:03.380 --> 07:04.939
Sprinklers.

07:06.340 --> 07:08.219
Suspension.

07:08.380 --> 07:10.179
I'm dead.

07:10.340 --> 07:13.139
Not you, Ednasi.
These two recidivists.

07:13.300 --> 07:17.339
Come on.
Sprinklers with orange water.

07:17.540 --> 07:20.179
If anything's to blame,
it's school spirit.

07:20.340 --> 07:23.939
He's right. School spirit...
there's your culprit.

07:24.100 --> 07:26.459
you, remove the shades,
stand up.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.459
- you, too, Chase.
- Me?

07:28.620 --> 07:31.299
I need a comparison.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.339
I always forget.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.499
Are the pupils supposed
to be smaller or bigger?

07:37.660 --> 07:40.699
Well, that all depends.

07:40.860 --> 07:43.139
Am I free to go?

07:49.500 --> 07:52.139
• Lift me up... •

07:52.300 --> 07:55.099
• And pull me closer... •

07:58.340 --> 08:00.579
I think that you really
got through to them today.

08:00.740 --> 08:03.699
When the orange water hit
the Centennial Committee table,

08:03.860 --> 08:06.179
I almost cried,
I was laughing so hard.

08:06.380 --> 08:07.379
But you never laugh.

08:07.540 --> 08:10.419
Well, it was on the inside.

08:11.980 --> 08:14.219
• She's the one •

08:14.380 --> 08:16.739
• Who lives the fire •

08:18.700 --> 08:20.859
• See a side •

08:21.060 --> 08:23.539
• you'll never know •

08:27.180 --> 08:31.219
• I need someone to be around •

08:31.380 --> 08:35.659
• 'Cause I'm breaking into lies. •

08:35.820 --> 08:39.578
- Hey, Brad.
- Nicole, what's up?

08:39.740 --> 08:41.339
What are you doing?

08:41.539 --> 08:45.419
Just waiting for my dad.
Our monthly meeting.

08:45.580 --> 08:49.739
you know, to keep in touch
every fourth Friday, 4:00.

08:49.900 --> 08:52.899
- At least that's the plan.
- Oh, that's cool.

08:53.060 --> 08:57.059
you were really good on TV today,
talking about centennial and all.

08:57.260 --> 08:58.299
Thanks.

08:58.460 --> 09:00.899
Well, it's a lot of work,
but it's worth it.

09:01.100 --> 09:03.619
Hmm.
Hey, um...

09:03.780 --> 09:06.739
do you wanna go to, uh...

09:06.940 --> 09:09.259
down to Shoe World
with me?

09:09.420 --> 09:12.139
Shoe World, oh.

09:12.300 --> 09:15.099
I can't. My dad.

09:15.260 --> 09:18.899
But he's always late.
you wanna help me finish these fries?

09:19.900 --> 09:21.899
I'd better not get in the way.

09:22.060 --> 09:24.019
I gotta pick up some new kicks
for the game tonight.

09:25.060 --> 09:27.219
Okay.
Well, I'll see you there.

09:27.420 --> 09:30.259
you're coming! Right on.

09:44.380 --> 09:47.259
It's a time-out for the Tigers!

09:50.980 --> 09:52.619
Why hasn't he asked me yet?

09:52.820 --> 09:56.459
Well, there is one other option
for Bradley's centennial date.

09:56.620 --> 10:00.179
you said the whole provincial event
barely registers on your radar,

10:00.340 --> 10:02.659
that you'd be happy
to go with toast.

10:02.820 --> 10:05.739
I said Brad has
all the appeal of toast.

10:05.900 --> 10:07.659
- There's a difference.
- Come on, look at him.

10:07.820 --> 10:08.819
yeah?

10:08.980 --> 10:11.019
All I'm saying is that
there's a process.

10:11.180 --> 10:14.299
Sure, it's not written down, but I have
given all the appropriate signs,

10:14.460 --> 10:16.979
and Brad knows the rules.

10:17.140 --> 10:19.619
Look, it's Designated Dave.

10:19.780 --> 10:23.179
Alicia, I've got a message
from Brad.

10:23.340 --> 10:26.459
Can I talk to you
for a second in private?

10:36.100 --> 10:38.459
The fact of the matter is that
the Chinese government

10:38.620 --> 10:40.139
is so afraid of the Dalai Lama,

10:40.300 --> 10:41.779
they actually outlawed
his likeness.

10:41.940 --> 10:44.699
So, Ray, when are you gonna
take over "Wake Up, Time Zone"

10:44.860 --> 10:46.499
and get some real moves on?

10:46.660 --> 10:49.819
It's all that school spirit
bullshit propaganda.

10:49.980 --> 10:52.459
Excitement mounts
as centennial nears.

10:52.620 --> 10:55.019
Ray is a plotter.

10:55.180 --> 10:56.779
- Mm-hmm.
- Watch. you'll see.

10:56.940 --> 10:58.139
One day we're gonna look up
in homeroom

10:58.340 --> 11:01.699
- and "Wake Up, Time Zone" will be...
- Vivisection.

11:01.860 --> 11:05.219
...completely revolutionized.
- Hi, I'm Joshua Hill,

11:05.380 --> 11:08.019
from the university's chapter
of ALF.

11:08.180 --> 11:11.339
- That's Animal Liberation Front.
- Alf?

11:11.500 --> 11:13.979
I think when you see what I'm about
to show you what's going on

11:14.140 --> 11:16.499
in our laboratories
right here on campus,

11:16.660 --> 11:20.579
you'll understand why we're taking
just a few minutes of your time.

11:20.780 --> 11:23.179
Lights.

11:25.460 --> 11:28.099
"Biomedical research"...
that's the two-word excuse...

11:28.260 --> 11:31.819
- you ready to go, go, go?
- Chase, I wanna see this.

11:31.980 --> 11:36.219
When asked about the abuses
taking place in the laboratory...

11:36.420 --> 11:39.819
Defense! Defense! Defense!

11:59.460 --> 12:00.939
Seldon appears to be okay,

12:01.100 --> 12:03.779
but it's a time-out for the Tigers.

12:06.380 --> 12:08.899
- I hope he's not hurt.
- yeah, me, too.

12:09.060 --> 12:12.299
I'm thrilled to report Brad's exercised
the next element of protocol.

12:12.500 --> 12:13.659
Dave was an emissary?

12:13.820 --> 12:16.019
He asked me if I thought
if Brad asked you

12:16.180 --> 12:18.299
to share the evening
and if you'd say yes.

12:18.460 --> 12:20.619
- And?
- And so I told him to tell Brad

12:20.780 --> 12:23.299
that you said that a real man
works without a net.

12:23.460 --> 12:27.379
- you what?
- Relax. He's all yours.

12:28.540 --> 12:31.779
Scheming socialite snags
dream date.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.019
• Buy a ticket •

12:35.180 --> 12:38.459
• Forget the change... •

12:38.620 --> 12:40.379
Chase, do you have
to get so close?

12:40.540 --> 12:42.859
- Closer is louder!
- That's my point!

12:43.020 --> 12:46.019
- Mine, too.
- We can't talk up there.

12:46.180 --> 12:48.459
We talked in the car.

12:52.820 --> 12:54.499
Is something in particular
on your mind?

12:54.660 --> 12:56.739
I just don't see why you won't come
with us tomorrow night.

12:56.900 --> 12:59.139
- To ALF?
- Come on, it's right up your alley.

12:59.340 --> 13:01.979
I told you already.
I'm not interested. Drop it.

13:02.140 --> 13:05.659
Look, you go, okay?
Knock yourself out.

13:05.820 --> 13:07.499
I don't get you.

13:07.660 --> 13:10.499
I mean, you spend half your life
in detention protesting Hanson

13:10.660 --> 13:12.459
- or the constipated hitter...
- Designated hitter.

13:12.620 --> 13:14.019
Whatever.

13:14.180 --> 13:16.499
But when it comes to something
really important...

13:16.660 --> 13:18.619
What?

13:18.780 --> 13:21.299
You think you're
so James Dean, Chase.

13:21.460 --> 13:25.019
But all this so-called rebellion...
it's a joke.

13:27.180 --> 13:29.459
We're breaking up, aren't we?

13:29.660 --> 13:32.859
I just think that we're headed
in different directions.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.699
That's all.

13:51.020 --> 13:55.899
• your big day •

14:03.020 --> 14:08.139
• your big day. •

14:20.180 --> 14:22.059
Are you stoned?

14:22.220 --> 14:24.659
Are you serious?

14:25.660 --> 14:27.539
It's 9:00 p.m.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.739
yeah, so it is.

14:30.900 --> 14:32.659
you didn't get out of bed all day.

14:32.820 --> 14:35.179
Then wouldn't
the correct question be,

14:35.340 --> 14:37.259
"Son, are you ill?"

14:37.420 --> 14:41.019
- Are you?
- No.

14:46.220 --> 14:48.099
Are you stoned?

14:48.260 --> 14:49.939
you could tell me, you know.
I'd be cool.

14:50.100 --> 14:52.619
yeah, I know you'd be cool.

14:52.780 --> 14:54.379
And what is that
supposed to mean?

14:54.580 --> 14:56.259
It means I've read your yearbook.

14:56.420 --> 15:00.219
"Onward through the fog.
Light up and party.

15:00.420 --> 15:04.459
Have sex, be free,
we're the class of '73."

15:05.620 --> 15:07.339
Are you stoned?

15:07.500 --> 15:10.739
Dad, until you come in here

15:10.900 --> 15:13.499
and see a black light
and felt Led Zeppelin poster,

15:13.660 --> 15:15.619
rest easy.

15:15.780 --> 15:17.659
Promise?

15:17.820 --> 15:19.619
Promise.

15:21.060 --> 15:22.619
Mr. Hammond.

15:22.780 --> 15:25.899
- yo, rise and shine.
- We've got dates.

15:26.060 --> 15:28.579
Dates?

15:28.780 --> 15:32.379
• But I enjoy making some noise,
fooling around •

15:32.540 --> 15:33.939
• I listen to the sound •

15:34.100 --> 15:37.259
• You and I get
and everything's set •

15:37.420 --> 15:40.859
• Be sure you know how to have
a real good time... •

15:41.020 --> 15:42.899
What are you doing?

15:43.060 --> 15:46.139
If security asks, just come
over here and do your job.

15:46.340 --> 15:50.899
Nicole, I'm afraid
I've got some news.

15:51.060 --> 15:52.299
yeah?

15:52.460 --> 15:55.139
Adonis jock falls hard
for rival spirit head.

15:55.300 --> 15:56.499
Translation?

15:56.660 --> 15:59.139
The cheerleader from Apex,
the one he landed on

15:59.300 --> 16:00.739
last week in the game.

16:00.900 --> 16:03.019
The slut who pretended
she couldn't get out of his way?

16:03.180 --> 16:06.859
That's the one.
He loves her.

16:07.020 --> 16:10.179
Tsk. Love. Like I care.

16:11.980 --> 16:13.339
Wait a minute.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.419
Who's he taking
to our school centennial?

16:15.620 --> 16:18.099
That would be her.

16:18.260 --> 16:21.339
• Be sure you know how to have
a real good time. •

16:24.540 --> 16:26.419
What are we doing?

16:26.580 --> 16:29.419
I don't know.
She swore she'd be here with friends,

16:29.580 --> 16:31.299
you know, for safety.

16:31.460 --> 16:34.459
She swore?
Who is this chick?

16:34.620 --> 16:37.499
- Daughter Judy.
- Maybe she had to walk Astro.

16:37.660 --> 16:39.339
Daughter Judy's
her screen name.

16:39.500 --> 16:43.179
We've been emailing each other.
She's way into space.

16:43.340 --> 16:46.939
- Cyber girls are hot.
- Oh, yeah.

16:47.100 --> 16:49.819
I've never kissed another girl.

16:49.980 --> 16:53.739
I've never kissed Chase Hammond
at the Skate Palace in sixth grade.

16:53.900 --> 16:57.379
Chase Hammond? I never did it
with anything requiring batteries.

16:57.540 --> 16:59.299
Ooh!

16:59.460 --> 17:02.219
All right, that's enough.

17:05.740 --> 17:09.659
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:09.819 --> 17:13.059
- Gotta go.
- What? Wait, wait.

17:13.260 --> 17:15.419
I thought you weren't gonna do
that "safe ride" shit this year.

17:15.579 --> 17:17.898
Dude, colleges look
at extracurricular activities, man.

17:18.060 --> 17:20.378
Dave, you're in.
That's not why you do it.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.499
- Oh, yeah? Then why?
- you wanna know why?

17:23.660 --> 17:27.378
It's the same reason you're the manager
of the basketball team...

17:27.540 --> 17:29.059
you wanna be one of them.

17:29.220 --> 17:31.099
Who is this "them"?
People too drunk to drive?

17:31.260 --> 17:35.459
you're with your two best friends
waiting for girls,

17:35.620 --> 17:38.019
one of them quite possibly
Princess Leia,

17:38.180 --> 17:41.099
and you wanna leave so that some jock
will pat you on the head.

17:41.260 --> 17:44.539
I'm going.

17:45.940 --> 17:47.739
You should know that
half the party now believes

17:47.900 --> 17:50.459
you have a part-time job
at a gentlemen's cabaret.

17:50.620 --> 17:52.899
Like it matters.
Drive me home.

17:53.060 --> 17:54.779
you gotta be kidding.

17:54.940 --> 17:58.499
Puke on my leather interior?
I got your ride taken care of.

17:58.660 --> 18:01.459
- This way.
- Prince Charming is a dick.

18:01.620 --> 18:03.499
Bring on the frogs.

18:03.660 --> 18:05.419
Ribbit!

18:08.780 --> 18:11.099
you called for a safe ride?

18:14.940 --> 18:17.219
Okay, watch your head.

18:17.380 --> 18:19.059
I learned that on "Cops."

18:19.220 --> 18:20.979
you know where she lives?

18:21.140 --> 18:23.259
Oh, I think I can find it.

18:23.420 --> 18:26.299
Yo, Designated Dave,
you got room for one more, man?

18:26.500 --> 18:27.499
Sure.

18:27.660 --> 18:30.299
Hey, perhaps we could get you
some fries with that.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.659
Yeah.
Fries, a Coke and...

18:33.820 --> 18:35.459
What about a milk shake?

18:35.620 --> 18:37.099
Get yourself a Happy Meal.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.819
Girl gets two-faced boy
in back seat.

18:39.980 --> 18:42.619
Violence anticipated.

18:52.260 --> 18:54.659
There are rules, you know?

18:54.860 --> 18:56.779
- Rules?
- Rules.

18:56.940 --> 18:59.499
- What rules?
- Seniors rule!

18:59.700 --> 19:01.819
you don't send Designated Dave
to ask if I'll go with you

19:01.980 --> 19:04.059
if you don't plan on
following through with the offer.

19:04.220 --> 19:06.539
I was going to.
I was going to.

19:06.700 --> 19:08.179
It's just that...

19:08.340 --> 19:11.139
- He just...
- Shut up!

19:11.300 --> 19:14.459
I don't know.
I... I fell in love.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.899
So I heard.

19:17.060 --> 19:21.059
High school love is for saps, Brad,
or haven't you heard?

19:21.260 --> 19:24.299
Now I'm left alone with
the embarrassment and alienation

19:24.460 --> 19:27.579
of having to go stag to one
of the biggest nights of our lives?

19:27.740 --> 19:31.099
Not very likely.
I might as well skip it.

19:31.260 --> 19:33.899
Turn that thing off or I'm gonna go
Sean young on your ass!

19:34.060 --> 19:35.859
I think she means Sean Penn.

19:36.020 --> 19:39.059
That's good. Sean young scares me.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.379
Yuck it up, clowns.

19:41.540 --> 19:42.899
yeah, if you enjoy
my humiliation,

19:43.060 --> 19:44.739
Monday at Time Zone
should be a real "hootenin."

19:44.900 --> 19:46.699
It's hootenanny.

19:46.860 --> 19:48.899
I'm sorry. Look, I...

19:51.260 --> 19:54.419
Hey, can you just
drop me off here?

19:54.580 --> 19:56.219
But we're still a couple blocks
away from your house.

19:56.420 --> 19:58.139
you heard the man.

19:59.860 --> 20:02.739
- Okay, bye, meng.
- Vaya con dios.

20:02.900 --> 20:04.779
- Later, Chase.
- Nicole, wait.

20:07.180 --> 20:09.379
If your mom's awake,
she's gonna see right through

20:09.540 --> 20:11.619
that Dean Martin impression.

20:11.780 --> 20:13.899
I'll sneak you through the back.

20:17.180 --> 20:19.299
What?

20:21.740 --> 20:24.219
Her car's not here.

20:24.380 --> 20:26.539
She's not home.

20:28.620 --> 20:30.539
Okay, bye.

20:30.700 --> 20:34.219
• yeah, yeah, yeah •

20:36.620 --> 20:40.659
• Ooh, when I wake up •

20:40.820 --> 20:43.619
• And open my eyes •

20:43.780 --> 20:45.939
• I try my best •

20:46.140 --> 20:48.779
- • To make the time... •
- Moron.

20:48.940 --> 20:52.539
One eyebrow.
Taking Georgia Ann Warner.

20:52.700 --> 20:55.819
Failed health.
Taking Sue.

20:56.980 --> 20:59.339
Taking Dee Vine.

20:59.500 --> 21:02.459
• Sweet memory •

21:02.620 --> 21:06.899
• In a picture of you,
all my memories •

21:07.060 --> 21:10.659
• Someday a story... •

21:10.820 --> 21:12.779
Refers to himself
as the de-virginator.

21:12.940 --> 21:14.259
• In a picture of you •

21:14.460 --> 21:18.939
• And a picture of me •

21:19.100 --> 21:20.979
• Ooh-ooh, yeah •

21:21.140 --> 21:25.819
• I try, but I still see your face •

21:25.980 --> 21:29.499
• Hammering on the screen... •

21:33.020 --> 21:35.099
Give it up, bonehead.

21:35.260 --> 21:38.019
Princess Leia ain't coming.

21:38.180 --> 21:40.099
Take me to centennial, Chase.

21:40.260 --> 21:41.939
Nicole?

21:45.700 --> 21:49.299
- How'd you get this number?
- I remembered it.

21:49.460 --> 21:50.859
Take me?

21:51.020 --> 21:53.859
- You're drunk.
- I'm desperate.

21:54.020 --> 21:56.819
Oh, well,
when you put it that way.

21:56.980 --> 21:59.979
you're not offended,
so don't pretend to be.

22:00.140 --> 22:02.779
My guess... you're intrigued.

22:02.940 --> 22:06.739
- I am?
- Word's out, Dulcie dropped you.

22:06.900 --> 22:11.019
- Yeah, well...
- Well, you have a tiny idea how I feel.

22:11.220 --> 22:12.899
Look, I know you probably
don't give a damn

22:13.100 --> 22:15.139
about the centennial or me,

22:15.300 --> 22:17.619
and that's fine,
but starting Monday,

22:17.780 --> 22:20.899
I'm gonna be treated like
the biggest loser ever at Time Zone.

22:21.060 --> 22:22.699
The same girls dishing out
fake sympathy

22:22.900 --> 22:24.939
will be laughing behind my back.

22:25.100 --> 22:26.619
Some of them will try
to set me up out of pity,

22:26.820 --> 22:29.059
but I'll know every time I walk
in a room and it gets suddenly quiet,

22:29.220 --> 22:32.499
they were just talking about
my monumental failure.

22:32.700 --> 22:36.379
We can save each other
from disgrace.

22:36.580 --> 22:39.739
Each other?
What's in it for me?

22:42.060 --> 22:43.899
If you have to ask,

22:44.060 --> 22:45.939
you're not as smart
as you think you are.

22:49.340 --> 22:51.059
you need to sleep on it,
get back to me.

23:01.740 --> 23:02.859
Hey, it's Dulcie.

23:03.020 --> 23:05.259
If you want me to get back to you,
leave three ways that high school sucks.

23:06.940 --> 23:11.459
There's the rampant homophobia,
no pep rallies for the debate team,

23:11.660 --> 23:14.779
which leads to the greater issue,
I'm sure,

23:14.940 --> 23:18.859
of the highly fascist nature
of pep rallies in general,

23:19.020 --> 23:21.539
speeches, saluting banners.

23:21.700 --> 23:25.459
I think you see
where I'm going with this.

23:25.620 --> 23:29.779
And finally, it sucks

23:29.940 --> 23:33.739
because when you break up
with someone,

23:33.900 --> 23:37.179
you can't escape them,

23:37.340 --> 23:41.859
and it kills you
to see them every day.

23:42.060 --> 23:45.899
Dulcie, call me tonight.

23:46.060 --> 23:49.179
I don't care what time...

24:28.300 --> 24:30.819
Let's agree on an easy-out clause.

24:32.300 --> 24:34.299
Obviously.

24:39.620 --> 24:41.539
We can't do this halfway.

24:41.700 --> 24:43.059
you know, if we expect
people to buy it,

24:43.220 --> 24:45.019
it's gotta feel real
through and through.

24:45.180 --> 24:47.379
That makes sense.

24:47.540 --> 24:49.739
If you really wanna get Dulcie back,

24:49.900 --> 24:53.539
it's gonna require
some severe measures.

24:54.540 --> 24:56.619
Define "severe."

24:56.780 --> 25:01.219
To start, you can't wear

25:01.380 --> 25:03.219
anything you own.

25:04.660 --> 25:06.219
Probably not.

25:06.380 --> 25:10.499
Not and...
we need to clean you up.

25:11.540 --> 25:14.299
How up are we talking about?

25:15.740 --> 25:17.619
Listen, Chase,

25:17.780 --> 25:21.659
to make an impact,
you have to go to extremes.

25:29.740 --> 25:31.899
Let's do it.

25:32.060 --> 25:34.059
Nice hat.

25:40.860 --> 25:44.419
• Here we go •

25:44.580 --> 25:48.899
• Something tells me
that I've been here before... •

25:49.060 --> 25:50.419
Come on!

25:50.580 --> 25:54.179
• Even though
I might be dreaming •

25:54.340 --> 25:56.899
• I don't care, I want more... •

25:57.060 --> 25:58.579
Hi, welcome to the Gap.

25:58.780 --> 26:02.699
• But I don't know •

26:02.860 --> 26:05.779
• What's happening, please •

26:05.940 --> 26:10.019
• Is this really happening
to me? •

26:10.180 --> 26:14.299
• Is this really happening to me? •

26:14.460 --> 26:18.179
• Is this really happening
to me? •

26:18.340 --> 26:22.979
• Is this really happening to me? •

26:24.340 --> 26:26.899
- Nicole?
- Oh, hey, Ray.

26:27.100 --> 26:30.979
Hey. Look, I just want you to know
that I know you're screwed.

26:31.140 --> 26:32.459
About the dance, I mean.

26:32.620 --> 26:35.979
And, um, well, I guess
what I'm trying to say is that

26:36.140 --> 26:39.379
if it comes down to panic time
and you still don't have a date,

26:39.540 --> 26:42.819
and you're, like, really desperate,

26:42.980 --> 26:44.659
well, I'd take you.

26:44.820 --> 26:46.499
I'd be honored.

26:46.660 --> 26:48.699
Oh, that's sweet, Ray,

26:48.860 --> 26:51.139
but, well, when Chase and I got out
of the car the other night,

26:51.300 --> 26:52.979
we kind of decided
we'd go together.

26:53.140 --> 26:55.699
Chase? My Chase?

27:01.300 --> 27:02.619
I got it.

27:02.780 --> 27:04.339
Hey, this is funnier
than you dressing up

27:04.500 --> 27:07.099
for last year's
Junior Miss Pageant, man.

27:07.260 --> 27:09.819
Ray. Hey, Nicole.

27:10.020 --> 27:12.019
So I'm glad to see you're out
of your doldrums.

27:12.180 --> 27:15.019
That hair, guy, is just...

27:15.180 --> 27:17.419
Hey, so, Nicole,
remember what I said.

27:17.580 --> 27:20.939
I'm serious.
If you want.

27:24.100 --> 27:28.099
Well, this is real convincing.
I'm a walking punch line.

27:28.260 --> 27:31.539
But who gets the last laugh?
See you after school, hon.

27:35.100 --> 27:38.019
Shit. Hurry, Dave.
I promised Ray we'd take him to work.

27:38.180 --> 27:39.619
Are you going to explain this to me?

27:39.780 --> 27:41.859
- Explain what?
- This. What are you trying to pull?

27:42.020 --> 27:43.259
Nothing.
It's a big-ass mistake.

27:43.420 --> 27:44.739
I thought it would make
Dulcie come back.

27:44.900 --> 27:46.179
Seriously? How?

27:46.340 --> 27:48.819
Can you think of anything
that would make Dulcie freak out more

27:49.020 --> 27:51.739
than me with
"Miss School Spirit" Nicole Maris?

27:54.900 --> 27:58.899
- He still thinks I'm joking.
- So what are you doing?

27:59.060 --> 28:02.499
you know, to make an impact,
you have to go to extremes.

28:02.700 --> 28:06.019
Did I just hear something
about extremes?

28:06.180 --> 28:07.699
It's real extreme, all right.

28:09.300 --> 28:10.939
Why'd you do it?

28:11.100 --> 28:13.059
Time for a change.

28:13.220 --> 28:14.859
It's not you.

28:15.020 --> 28:17.539
Who knows who I am?

28:17.700 --> 28:19.979
I do.

28:22.060 --> 28:24.619
Don't let Nicole Maris change you.

28:24.780 --> 28:26.579
I'll be all right.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.059
yeah.

28:35.940 --> 28:37.699
Dave, do you mind
stopping off at the mall?

28:37.900 --> 28:40.539
I wanna pick up a Swatch.

28:42.300 --> 28:44.699
Nicole, can you come
in here, honey?

28:46.180 --> 28:48.419
So, what are we burning today?

28:48.620 --> 28:51.139
Fields of Jasmine
for improved circulation?

28:51.300 --> 28:54.059
Strawberry Explosion
for brain power?

28:54.220 --> 28:57.339
- your dad called.
- Why?

28:57.500 --> 29:00.499
He said that he'll meet you
at 12:00 noon on Sunday

29:00.660 --> 29:02.019
at Jefferson Park.

29:02.180 --> 29:04.899
He promised he'd show up
this time.

29:08.460 --> 29:10.459
So get out there
and support the Tigers

29:10.620 --> 29:11.779
on their march
to a state championship.

29:11.940 --> 29:14.659
- Look, we're going to that.
- A basketball game?

29:19.660 --> 29:21.059
That wasn't part
of the arrangement.

29:21.220 --> 29:23.139
A necessary evil, Chase.

29:23.300 --> 29:24.979
We have to look chummy,
remember?

29:25.140 --> 29:27.099
And the benefit of that?

29:27.260 --> 29:28.659
We're in this together.

29:28.820 --> 29:30.219
From my point of view,

29:30.380 --> 29:32.219
it's okay to look like I'm going
to the dance with a friend.

29:32.380 --> 29:34.979
It's not okay to look like
I paid a guy to take me.

29:35.140 --> 29:37.579
I could be getting paid?

29:49.100 --> 29:50.579
yeah!

29:51.980 --> 29:54.979
So, how does it compare?

29:55.140 --> 29:57.099
To what?

29:57.260 --> 29:59.659
Protests, clove cigarettes,
bongos...

29:59.860 --> 30:02.939
- whatever it is you beatniks do.
- We prefer "disaffected youth."

30:03.100 --> 30:05.019
Okay, so...

30:05.180 --> 30:06.699
More pep.

30:06.860 --> 30:08.579
The monopoly on pep
is definitely held

30:08.780 --> 30:10.779
by Time Zone's status whores.

30:10.940 --> 30:13.899
We prefer socially non-retarded.

30:19.980 --> 30:25.379
Go! Fight! Win!

30:39.180 --> 30:41.339
- Whoo!
- I'm gonna get something to drink.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.699
- Do you want anything?
- No, but thanks.

30:43.900 --> 30:47.459
- Pellegrino. With a twist.
- All right.

30:50.220 --> 30:53.379
- All right, spill.
- Spill what?

30:53.580 --> 30:55.219
It's cute and all making nice
with your neighbor,

30:55.380 --> 30:57.819
but you're taking it
way above and beyond.

30:57.980 --> 31:00.019
Above and beyond what?

31:01.020 --> 31:03.939
- The boy cleans up nicely.
- Pretty shocking, huh?

31:04.100 --> 31:07.059
Maybe. Or maybe
you haven't given up.

31:07.260 --> 31:10.259
- Given up?
- A perfect night with a dream date.

31:10.420 --> 31:12.339
Brad? Over it.

31:12.500 --> 31:14.339
So, this Chase Hammond thing...

31:14.500 --> 31:16.899
he's just this good friend
we never knew you had?

31:17.100 --> 31:19.499
Right.

31:19.660 --> 31:22.939
Who knows?
Maybe more.

31:26.780 --> 31:28.979
How can you be against
the designated hitter?

31:29.140 --> 31:32.299
Do you wanna see Cecil Fielder
gunning for his 120th RBI

31:32.460 --> 31:34.619
or some fast-ass relief pitcher
swinging at air?

31:34.780 --> 31:37.819
I think Fielder is a perfect example...
a past-his-prime power hitter

31:37.980 --> 31:40.579
in the twilight of his career
using up a roster spot.

31:40.740 --> 31:42.459
you know what?
Someday that's gonna be Griffey.

31:42.620 --> 31:45.219
And I would rather see Junior at 40
than some Jim Bob

31:45.420 --> 31:47.419
who made it to the show
because of an expansion.

31:47.580 --> 31:50.499
That's very nostalgic, but it comes
down to one simple issue...

31:50.660 --> 31:52.939
- purity of the game.
- Exactly.

31:53.140 --> 31:54.859
I've been trying
to tell you that, man.

31:55.020 --> 31:58.459
If you can't hack it,
get out of the game, right? Huh?

32:17.460 --> 32:23.099
Go! Fight! Win!

32:32.460 --> 32:34.699
Go! Fight...

32:43.820 --> 32:47.859
Defense! Defense! Defense!

32:51.460 --> 32:53.979
One more eye, ref,
you'd be a Cyclops!

33:11.980 --> 33:13.619
Go Tigers!

33:15.820 --> 33:17.459
Whoo! Pass!

33:23.900 --> 33:27.099
And it's good! Tigers take it 70-68.

33:47.620 --> 33:49.899
- Masterful.
- What?

33:50.060 --> 33:52.499
you really had me going in there.
"Go! Fight! Win!"

33:52.660 --> 33:55.619
I about choked.
I bow down to the king of scams.

33:55.780 --> 33:59.139
I'd like to thank the Academy.
Thank you. Thank you.

33:59.300 --> 34:01.899
- Think you could stand anymore?
- Well, what did you have in mind?

34:02.100 --> 34:04.059
Cruising Broad Street.

34:04.220 --> 34:05.219
I thought you had to have
a letterjacket for that.

34:05.380 --> 34:06.739
That's just to nail cheerleaders.

34:06.940 --> 34:08.699
Don't worry.
you'll fit right in.

34:10.420 --> 34:12.418
Bad-ass ride, Chase.

34:12.580 --> 34:14.259
yeah, every time
Halley's Comet flies,

34:14.420 --> 34:16.418
my dad lets me take it
out of the garage.

34:16.580 --> 34:19.259
I had to leave a spleen on deposit.

34:20.260 --> 34:22.739
Well, if Alicia sees it,
she's gonna wanna jump you.

34:22.900 --> 34:25.059
yeah, what's the deal
with that chick?

34:25.219 --> 34:27.498
Word on the street,
she sleeps in a casket.

34:27.659 --> 34:30.458
- "Word on the street"?
- Yeah, the chick's evil.

34:30.620 --> 34:32.179
Evil's a bit strong.

34:32.380 --> 34:35.139
Limited bullshit tolerance
is more like it, but you're a guy.

34:35.340 --> 34:37.139
you wouldn't understand.

34:37.340 --> 34:39.299
Time Zone... 70,
losers... 68.

34:39.460 --> 34:40.938
Whoo-hoo!

34:41.139 --> 34:42.179
Honk your horn, Hambone!

34:42.340 --> 34:44.619
Honk, Chase.

34:44.780 --> 34:48.259
Whoo! Go Tigers!

34:49.620 --> 34:51.219
I wouldn't understand what?

34:51.380 --> 34:53.659
Well, when guys compete,
it's overt.

34:53.860 --> 34:55.779
you know, ringing a bell
with a sledgehammer

34:55.940 --> 34:58.579
or loogie chucking,
the size of your engine, whatever.

34:58.780 --> 35:00.139
yeah?

35:00.300 --> 35:03.099
Well, when girls compete, it's art.

35:03.260 --> 35:07.779
And Alicia, she's an artist.

35:07.940 --> 35:10.659
• But it's the only thing •

35:10.820 --> 35:12.779
• I wanna do... •

35:12.940 --> 35:14.779
This is the good part.

35:14.940 --> 35:18.619
- • I don't wanna sleep... •
- Come on, you know you like it.

35:18.780 --> 35:21.579
• I just wanna keep on
loving you... •

35:21.740 --> 35:23.299
No, bad.

35:23.460 --> 35:26.659
• Baby, I'm gonna keep on •

35:26.820 --> 35:29.939
- • Loving you... •
- Come on. Come on.

35:30.100 --> 35:35.499
• 'Cause it's the only thing
I wanna do •

35:35.660 --> 35:39.099
• I don't wanna sleep •

35:39.260 --> 35:45.139
• I just wanna keep on
loving you. •

35:54.980 --> 35:56.459
Nicole.

35:56.620 --> 35:59.059
Psst, Nicole.

36:00.620 --> 36:03.379
Are you and Chase Hammond
a couple?

36:03.540 --> 36:05.259
I saw you cruising together.

36:05.420 --> 36:08.299
He's my next-door neighbor.

36:08.460 --> 36:11.739
Okay, so he's not your boyfriend
or anything, right?

36:28.060 --> 36:30.099
Mr. Maris.

36:32.740 --> 36:35.019
That hurts, baby.

36:35.180 --> 36:37.059
Tell me about it.

36:40.420 --> 36:41.979
Come for a ride with me.

36:45.740 --> 36:48.819
- So, any special boy these days?
- Not likely.

36:48.980 --> 36:51.739
I have some pretty serious trust issues
when it comes to the male sex.

36:51.900 --> 36:53.859
I wonder where it comes from.

37:01.780 --> 37:05.259
I want you to have this.
This might explain me better than I can.

37:06.900 --> 37:09.779
"Zen and the Art
of Motorcycle Maintenance"?

37:09.940 --> 37:12.419
This is supposed to explain
why you're never around?

37:12.620 --> 37:15.339
Wow!
Must be a hell of a book.

37:22.700 --> 37:24.819
First two weeks of November

37:24.980 --> 37:28.939
I am going to a huge
ballooning festival in Rio.

37:29.140 --> 37:31.379
I want you to come.

37:31.540 --> 37:33.819
This is the trip of a lifetime.
What do you say?

37:34.020 --> 37:37.619
Oh, there's this little centennial thing
I'm kind of involved in,

37:37.780 --> 37:40.379
but, well, you wouldn't know
anything about it.

37:50.700 --> 37:53.339
yeah, 14 times.

37:54.820 --> 37:56.659
- Hey, Nicole?
- Yeah.

37:56.820 --> 37:59.379
Hi. I'm... I'm...

37:59.540 --> 38:02.499
you're in charge of bands
for the centennial, right?

38:02.660 --> 38:05.699
I am.

38:05.860 --> 38:08.979
• See that boy,
he looks so fine •

38:09.980 --> 38:13.179
• But he's got a girlfriend,
my, oh, my •

38:13.340 --> 38:14.459
• Go, go, go! •

38:14.620 --> 38:16.699
- What's this?
- It's the Electrocutes.

38:16.860 --> 38:20.019
- It's the best band in town.
- Stylish.

38:20.180 --> 38:22.299
- Thanks.
- you made this?

38:22.460 --> 38:24.139
yeah.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.139
So, how do you like the band?

38:29.300 --> 38:31.619
They rock, but I doubt
they're up on their Brandy.

38:31.780 --> 38:34.179
Brandy?
There's a sister with edge.

38:34.340 --> 38:36.459
That's the direction
the committee's going, Ray...

38:36.620 --> 38:38.179
quality with mass appeal.

38:38.340 --> 38:41.659
Can you say oxymoron?

38:43.700 --> 38:45.699
My brothers!

38:45.860 --> 38:47.659
Oh, look, Dave.
It's Ken doll.

38:47.820 --> 38:49.219
yeah, aren't you losing
reputation points

38:49.380 --> 38:50.379
just being this close to us?

38:50.540 --> 38:53.059
Hey, guys, I'm pulling off
the biggest scam of all time,

38:53.220 --> 38:54.379
and I'm catching shit?

38:54.540 --> 38:56.859
Don't you see?
I've entered into their world.

38:57.060 --> 38:58.859
Ooh, did you leave bread crumbs?

38:59.060 --> 39:01.179
Glow in the dark.

39:01.340 --> 39:03.019
Hey, Electrocutes tonight
at the Pit.

39:03.180 --> 39:05.819
yeah, I'll be there. Wait.

39:06.900 --> 39:09.579
- I told Nicole that...
- yeah, it's a scam, all right,

39:09.780 --> 39:11.779
- but who's scamming who?
- Whom.

39:11.940 --> 39:13.139
- Whatever, man.
- Think about it, Chase.

39:13.300 --> 39:16.659
you have all the duties of a girlfriend
and none of the perks.

39:16.820 --> 39:20.139
You're not getting
any perks, are you?

39:20.300 --> 39:22.059
Hey, Hambone,
you're coming tonight, right, man?

39:22.220 --> 39:24.499
- Oh, yeah, we'll be there.
- All right, man!

39:24.660 --> 39:27.899
- Hambone?
- He really has entered their world.

39:28.060 --> 39:30.899
14 times!

39:34.980 --> 39:37.139
No, seriously,
who would you rather do,

39:37.300 --> 39:39.499
Agent Scully or Gillian Anderson?

39:39.660 --> 39:41.099
They're the same person,
brainiac.

39:41.260 --> 39:42.619
Eddie, please.

39:42.780 --> 39:44.299
Hambone?

39:45.540 --> 39:47.539
Flakey, self-absorbed,
neurotic actress type

39:47.700 --> 39:49.899
or gun-toting,
badass FBI agent

39:50.060 --> 39:52.179
with years of pent-up
sexual frustration?

39:52.340 --> 39:53.779
- Not even close.
- My man.

39:53.940 --> 39:55.619
What I wouldn't do to Scully.

39:55.780 --> 39:57.819
I'm sure she's been
drooled on before.

39:57.980 --> 39:59.779
Jealous.

39:59.940 --> 40:01.859
Order number nine is up.

40:02.020 --> 40:04.419
Number nine. Number nine.

40:04.580 --> 40:06.379
Can you believe
that the assistant manager

40:06.540 --> 40:09.779
of our basketball team actually has
his own "X-Files" website?

40:09.940 --> 40:12.019
And he invited me over to his house
to check it out.

40:12.220 --> 40:13.619
His name's Dave.

40:13.780 --> 40:14.939
What?

40:15.140 --> 40:17.139
Oh, you know, man.
Designated Dave.

40:17.300 --> 40:19.619
You know,
the safe ride guy, right?

40:19.780 --> 40:23.179
No, it's not Designated Dave.
It's plain Dave.

40:23.340 --> 40:26.019
No "designated."
Just Dave.

40:26.180 --> 40:29.179
All right, plain Dave it is.

40:30.980 --> 40:33.059
Chase, I left my bag in the car.

40:34.300 --> 40:36.899
Help me find it?

40:43.740 --> 40:44.939
So, what was that about, huh?

40:45.100 --> 40:47.379
Dave probably saved half their lives,
and they're making fun of him.

40:47.540 --> 40:49.339
- Typical.
- Typical of what?

40:49.500 --> 40:51.179
Is this more "us/them" rhetoric?

40:51.380 --> 40:54.259
- Well, if the tiara fits...
- Come on, Chase.

40:54.420 --> 40:56.339
Can you honestly tell me
you've never made fun

40:56.500 --> 40:57.979
of those people over there?

40:59.180 --> 41:00.939
No, that's different.

41:01.140 --> 41:03.139
- How?
- Think about it.

41:03.300 --> 41:05.579
We laugh when it's the boss
or the debutante

41:05.740 --> 41:08.179
who slipped on a banana peel,
not Tiny Tim.

41:08.340 --> 41:11.659
Oh, so you're calling Dave
"Tiny Tim"?

41:11.860 --> 41:14.059
- Don't do that.
- It's okay for you to put him down.

41:15.700 --> 41:19.779
I don't need this, not from you.
you're better than this.

41:19.940 --> 41:21.859
What makes you say that?

41:23.580 --> 41:25.579
Fifth grade...

41:25.740 --> 41:26.899
the first year the teachers
start making us

41:27.060 --> 41:28.059
write Valentines to each other.

41:28.220 --> 41:30.579
- yeah.
- Dave got one card.

41:30.740 --> 41:33.219
"I'm bananas about you.
Love, Nicole."

41:36.380 --> 41:38.979
How do you remember that?

41:39.180 --> 41:41.339
- I just do. I'm out of here.
- Don't.

41:41.500 --> 41:45.099
Look, if you leave mad,
it sets us back.

41:46.700 --> 41:51.179
It doesn't set me back.
Don't know how I got myself into this.

41:51.340 --> 41:53.819
So far, the payback's
been minimal.

41:53.980 --> 41:56.219
It's all about you...
your friends and your turf.

41:56.380 --> 41:58.899
- My turf?
- Nicole.

41:59.060 --> 42:02.059
Okay. you're right.

42:03.540 --> 42:06.259
First, come back.

42:06.460 --> 42:09.739
Be the charmer
we both know you can be.

42:09.900 --> 42:12.419
And then we'll go
wherever you wanna go.

42:12.580 --> 42:15.059
Wherever I want?

42:21.340 --> 42:23.419
• I'm ready to rip it up, yeah •

42:23.580 --> 42:26.259
• I'm ready to let it go •

42:26.420 --> 42:29.379
• yeah, I gotta turn up the action •

42:29.540 --> 42:31.419
• And get some rock and roll •

42:32.580 --> 42:34.299
• Don't got no time to waste •

42:34.460 --> 42:37.459
• I'm a rockin' mass
ready to blow •

42:38.460 --> 42:40.259
• 'Cause I'm gonna be
chasing the night •

42:40.420 --> 42:43.099
• So turn up the radio •

42:44.260 --> 42:46.019
• 'Cause I'm gonna be
out on the street •

42:46.180 --> 42:49.259
• yeah, we're gonna
be out all night •

42:49.460 --> 42:52.019
• We're gonna be checking it out •

42:52.180 --> 42:54.699
• All right, all right! •

42:54.860 --> 42:57.659
• 'Cause I'm gonna be
out of my mind •

42:57.820 --> 43:00.579
• yeah, I'm gonna be
out of my head... •

43:01.820 --> 43:04.179
Liz, Drena,
you know Nicole.

43:04.340 --> 43:07.339
yeah, from the slumber party
last weekend.

43:07.500 --> 43:09.619
- We painted each other's toenails.
- Look, why don't you girls just...

43:09.780 --> 43:11.779
And then we played
Truth or Dare, remember?

43:11.980 --> 43:13.739
you two admitted
liking Alanis Morissette

43:13.940 --> 43:16.099
before the record went platinum.

43:16.260 --> 43:18.459
- I never liked Alan...
- You did, too.

43:20.380 --> 43:24.299
- So where's Dulcie?
- She'll probably be by later.

43:24.460 --> 43:27.099
Did that hurt?

43:27.260 --> 43:28.939
Not as much as this.

43:29.100 --> 43:30.979
Nipple ring, cool.

43:31.140 --> 43:33.059
Take your top off.
Let's get a look at it.

43:34.460 --> 43:36.339
Hey, Nicole.

43:36.500 --> 43:38.819
Wanna dance?

43:38.980 --> 43:40.979
• I gotta turn up the action •

43:41.180 --> 43:44.499
• And get some rock and roll •

43:44.660 --> 43:46.579
• Don't got no time to waste •

43:46.740 --> 43:48.979
• I'm a rockin' mass
ready to blow... •

43:49.140 --> 43:50.179
yeah!

43:50.340 --> 43:52.339
• 'Cause I'm gonna be
chasing the night •

43:52.500 --> 43:55.139
• So turn up the radio •

43:56.180 --> 43:58.019
• 'Cause I'm gonna be
out on the street •

43:58.180 --> 44:01.859
• yeah, we're gonna
be out all night •

44:02.020 --> 44:04.019
• We're gonna be
checking it out •

44:04.180 --> 44:06.699
• All right, all right! •

44:06.860 --> 44:09.939
• 'Cause I'm gonna be
out of my mind... •

44:19.060 --> 44:21.219
- Hey, Brad.
- Hey, Alicia.

44:21.380 --> 44:25.259
you know,
Kathy really is a sweetie.

44:25.420 --> 44:27.859
yeah, she is. Thanks.

44:28.060 --> 44:31.859
you know,
it's really cool that you say that.

44:32.060 --> 44:34.739
I mean, it really is,
'cause a lot of the other girls

44:34.940 --> 44:37.899
have been complete bitches,
you know?

44:38.060 --> 44:39.979
'Cause of the whole Nicole thing.

44:40.140 --> 44:44.019
They're just jealous.
Besides, you're better off.

44:44.180 --> 44:45.619
Really?

44:45.780 --> 44:48.219
I thought that you and Nicole were,
like, really good friends.

44:48.380 --> 44:51.699
Best of, but everyone knows
Nicole's a lot of talk

44:51.860 --> 44:53.859
and very little action.

44:54.020 --> 44:57.179
yeah, but a lot of girls
are like that.

44:57.380 --> 44:59.419
Not all girls.

45:03.380 --> 45:05.899
• yeah, I'm gonna be
out of my mind •

45:06.060 --> 45:08.659
• yeah, I'm gonna be out of it •

45:08.820 --> 45:11.819
• yeah, I'm gonna be out tonight. •

45:12.020 --> 45:14.019
Thank you.

45:16.260 --> 45:18.859
- Something to drink?
- Water.

45:29.420 --> 45:33.059
Chase, I didn't expect
to see you here.

45:33.220 --> 45:35.459
I come here a lot.

45:35.620 --> 45:38.339
Not lately.

45:38.500 --> 45:42.139
Hey.
There you go.

45:42.340 --> 45:44.539
Chase, this is Joshua.

45:44.700 --> 45:46.539
- How you doing?
- Hey.

45:50.460 --> 45:52.659
I didn't expect you to fall in love.

45:53.780 --> 45:56.019
I didn't expect you
to fall into the Gap.

46:00.940 --> 46:02.779
• you better run, baby, run •

46:02.940 --> 46:04.859
• Better move on in •

46:05.020 --> 46:08.219
• Everybody gets out
before they get in... •

46:08.380 --> 46:10.379
There you are.

46:12.540 --> 46:17.019
• But you must get down •

46:17.180 --> 46:21.459
• To the other side... •

46:22.580 --> 46:26.699
- Oh, hey, Dulcie.
- Get a room.

46:33.700 --> 46:37.339
- Masterful.
- Huh?

46:37.500 --> 46:40.179
I guess now I should bow down
to the queen of scams.

46:40.340 --> 46:42.219
• you better run, baby, run •

46:42.380 --> 46:44.259
• Better move on in •

46:44.420 --> 46:47.339
• Everybody gets out
before they get in... •

46:47.500 --> 46:48.979
Got more email
from Daughter Judy.

46:49.140 --> 46:50.659
The same one
who stood you up?

46:50.820 --> 46:52.579
She said she was
at the other Nyble flick.

46:52.740 --> 46:54.179
We were at the wrong theater.

46:54.340 --> 46:55.979
So when's the big hookup?

46:56.140 --> 46:57.979
I don't know.
I'm having second thoughts.

46:58.140 --> 46:59.779
I don't think I could take it
if she saw me

46:59.940 --> 47:01.419
and I saw this reaction
on her face...

47:01.580 --> 47:04.019
- you know, gross disappointment.
- Dave, it's not about looks.

47:04.180 --> 47:05.659
Uh-huh, and that's what
the Tooth Fairy was just saying.

47:05.820 --> 47:07.419
Hey, I'm doing a student poll
for the yearbook staff.

47:07.580 --> 47:10.059
We are doing a student poll
for the yearbook staff.

47:10.260 --> 47:11.579
Cool. Shoot.

47:11.740 --> 47:14.259
So what's your idea
of a perfect date?

47:14.420 --> 47:16.699
Date... series of activities,
or date... person?

47:16.860 --> 47:19.939
- Person.
- Activities.

47:20.100 --> 47:22.419
- The person.
- All right.

47:22.580 --> 47:25.899
She's the kind of girl
who will call you on your bullshit.

47:26.060 --> 47:29.299
She's not afraid to dance.
She offers to pay.

47:29.460 --> 47:33.259
She doesn't decide before a date
whether she's gonna kiss you or not.

47:33.420 --> 47:36.659
She's not completely earnest,
yet she's not completely ironic,

47:36.820 --> 47:39.779
Four grand is a good deal
for a jumbotron.

47:39.940 --> 47:42.059
I'd rather take the overage out
of decorations than entertainment.

47:42.220 --> 47:43.659
We'll lose the smoke.

47:43.820 --> 47:47.739
We got a Brandy-style cover band
that is so right, but they cost.

47:47.900 --> 47:50.419
Nicole, where are we budget-wise?

47:50.580 --> 47:53.379
Anyone got a stun gun?
Hello, Nicole?

47:53.540 --> 47:55.579
yeah.

47:55.740 --> 47:58.179
How much money do we have left
for decorations?

47:59.340 --> 48:02.299
Oh, the info's in my locker.
I'll figure it out later.

48:04.300 --> 48:06.619
Okay, I'll go get it now.

48:09.980 --> 48:11.579
What's up with Nicole?

48:11.780 --> 48:16.219
- I think she's in love.
- Well, they are a cute couple.

48:16.380 --> 48:18.139
She orders dessert,

48:18.300 --> 48:20.379
and she can be ready
in 10 minutes.

48:20.580 --> 48:21.979
Wow.

48:22.140 --> 48:25.419
Well, we will have to change
that "bullshit" to "bull."

48:25.580 --> 48:27.659
Well, then use "pretensions."

48:27.820 --> 48:29.819
Okay.

48:34.980 --> 48:36.819
Who are you?

48:41.820 --> 48:45.619
So, what's this I hear about you
and Chase Hammond?

48:45.780 --> 48:48.139
What do you hear?

48:48.300 --> 48:50.339
- you're an item.
- Item?

48:50.500 --> 48:52.139
- Mm-hmm.
- Where do you get your news?

48:52.300 --> 48:53.859
Mothers and daughters
should confide, honey.

48:54.020 --> 48:57.739
We saw a band.
We're going to a dance.

48:57.900 --> 48:59.659
I don't think he's such
a good idea, Nicole.

48:59.820 --> 49:03.699
- Why not?
- you're neighbors, for one thing.

49:03.860 --> 49:07.419
- And another thing is...
- Yeah?

49:08.740 --> 49:10.859
...he's too tall for you.

49:11.020 --> 49:12.939
Oh, Mom.

49:13.100 --> 49:14.819
It'll be okay.

49:16.740 --> 49:19.139
Do you like 'em?
They're the latest.

49:19.300 --> 49:22.419
yeah, they're great. Thanks.

49:22.580 --> 49:24.659
We're leaving early tomorrow.
You need me to call you?

49:24.820 --> 49:28.339
No, I'm fine.
I'm not even tired.

49:28.500 --> 49:30.179
Hey, you feel like a walk?

49:30.340 --> 49:32.459
Some of us require
beauty sleep, Chase.

49:32.620 --> 49:34.699
I'll let you get that.

49:34.860 --> 49:36.739
See you tomorrow.

49:36.900 --> 49:40.379
Hambone.

49:40.580 --> 49:42.059
Dickweed.

49:42.220 --> 49:43.619
You gotta see
what I'm working on, guy.

49:43.780 --> 49:46.499
Better yet, I'm offering you
a chance to participate.

49:46.660 --> 49:47.659
What is it?

49:47.820 --> 49:50.539
My man, you've gotta
see this to believe it.

49:50.700 --> 49:53.539
I got the editing room reserved
all day tomorrow.

49:53.700 --> 49:56.699
I'm... I'm all booked.

49:57.900 --> 49:59.899
Bread crumbs, mi amigo.

50:00.100 --> 50:02.099
Hasta.

50:12.020 --> 50:15.459
• I met you •

50:15.620 --> 50:19.139
• Before the fall of Rome •

50:19.300 --> 50:22.699
• And I beg you •

50:22.860 --> 50:26.299
• To let me take you home •

50:26.500 --> 50:28.939
• you were wrong,
I was right •

50:29.100 --> 50:30.939
• you said goodbye •

50:31.100 --> 50:33.979
• I said good night... •

50:35.340 --> 50:38.699
Look at 'em down there,
talking about us.

50:38.860 --> 50:40.379
Saying what, Eddie?

50:40.540 --> 50:43.099
you know, "He's cute.

50:43.260 --> 50:46.299
He's sweet. He's built."

50:46.460 --> 50:47.579
He primps.

50:47.740 --> 50:50.499
Eddie takes longer
to get ready to go out than I do.

50:50.660 --> 50:52.659
And he gets mad at me
for making him wait?

50:52.860 --> 50:55.419
But I do my share
of waiting, too, all right.

50:55.580 --> 50:57.739
Well, how long are you
gonna make him wait?

50:57.900 --> 51:01.259
The key to pleasing a woman
is sweet talk.

51:01.420 --> 51:03.459
"you're so beautiful."

51:03.660 --> 51:06.099
"Have you lost weight?"

51:06.260 --> 51:07.659
And then there
are the three words

51:07.820 --> 51:11.139
- that always seal the deal for me...
- "Another tequila shot?"

51:12.900 --> 51:15.419
Come on, Nicole,
we're bonding here. Dish, girl.

51:15.580 --> 51:18.619
Chase Hammond... big hands,

51:18.780 --> 51:21.299
big feet, you know?

51:28.980 --> 51:31.179
- Hey, Bo.
- It's Dee.

51:31.340 --> 51:33.219
Oh. yeah.

51:33.380 --> 51:34.499
Sorry about that.

51:34.660 --> 51:37.539
- It never was Bo.
- Oh, really?

51:37.740 --> 51:39.499
- I thought it was always...
- When you're 40 pounds overweight

51:39.700 --> 51:41.339
and your last name's Vine,

51:41.500 --> 51:43.499
it doesn't take people long
to land on a nickname.

51:43.700 --> 51:46.299
your parents named you
"Dee Vine"?

51:46.460 --> 51:50.539
No, Dee's a contraction.
I changed it myself.

51:50.700 --> 51:53.219
And no one said anything?

51:53.420 --> 51:55.619
you should go into politics.

51:55.780 --> 51:57.779
After I dropped the weight,
dyed my hair,

51:57.940 --> 52:00.419
got contacts,
I just kind of giggle and say,

52:00.580 --> 52:03.019
"Oh, yeah, so and so
started calling me Dee."

52:03.220 --> 52:05.099
Just kept attributing it
to whoever wasn't around

52:05.260 --> 52:07.939
and pretty soon,
well, here I am.

52:08.140 --> 52:10.699
Dee Vine.
And now Miss Time Zone.

52:12.700 --> 52:15.819
So, why share
all this juiciness with me?

52:16.900 --> 52:20.379
We're kindred, Hambone.

52:26.060 --> 52:29.059
you think you're happier now?

52:29.220 --> 52:32.339
I don't know. Do you?

52:32.540 --> 52:35.059
Jury's still out.

52:35.220 --> 52:39.179
It may have been a short list,
but before I became what I am now,

52:39.380 --> 52:41.899
at least I knew who cared
about me.

52:42.060 --> 52:44.699
Really cared.

52:46.260 --> 52:49.859
That's much better!
Oh, oh!

52:50.060 --> 52:52.419
Oh, boy, yeah!

52:52.580 --> 52:54.619
Hey, Kathy.

52:54.780 --> 52:57.979
Hey, Kathy!
Have you been over to Brad's?

52:58.140 --> 53:00.899
yeah. It's nice.

53:01.060 --> 53:05.819
Weird, huh?
His family seems so normal.

53:05.980 --> 53:09.099
you'd never guess they belong
to one of those doomsday cults.

53:09.260 --> 53:11.739
Are you serious?

53:17.940 --> 53:22.739
Nicole, better grab
Captain Kangaroo.

53:24.100 --> 53:26.819
I swear,
I can't take him anywhere.

53:43.220 --> 53:45.579
- Hang loose, Hambone!
- 'Night!

53:47.140 --> 53:48.979
you know,

53:49.140 --> 53:51.859
I still have the letter you wrote me
in seventh grade.

53:52.020 --> 53:53.379
Burn it.

53:53.580 --> 53:56.179
you said...
you said you hated me,

53:56.340 --> 53:57.979
and there was something in there
about how the only way

53:58.140 --> 54:00.259
you'd ever touch me again
was if you came down with leprosy.

54:00.460 --> 54:02.819
yeah, sorry about that.

54:02.980 --> 54:05.819
Don't be.
I deserved it.

54:05.980 --> 54:07.979
I'm the one who should be sorry.

54:08.180 --> 54:12.299
- Chase, when your mom got sick...
- Please, Nicole, let's not do this.

54:12.460 --> 54:14.019
I want to.

54:14.180 --> 54:16.299
I've wanted to say this
for five years now.

54:19.580 --> 54:21.459
When your mom got sick,

54:21.620 --> 54:23.339
I couldn't bear to go over
to your house.

54:23.500 --> 54:26.219
It was too hard.
I was too scared.

54:26.380 --> 54:29.019
I just wanted to cry all the time

54:29.180 --> 54:32.579
every time I saw her,

54:32.740 --> 54:35.179
every time I saw you.

54:38.340 --> 54:40.259
Even when we were together,
you wouldn't say anything.

54:40.460 --> 54:42.379
you'd just sit there.

54:42.540 --> 54:45.459
So, when you started wigging out
in school, skipping,

54:45.620 --> 54:48.859
pulling the fire alarms,

54:49.020 --> 54:51.179
I just acted like
I didn't know you.

54:51.340 --> 54:53.339
Well, I'm over it now.

55:02.220 --> 55:05.379
Well, 'night.

55:05.540 --> 55:07.419
yeah.

55:23.900 --> 55:26.299
you forgot your towels.

55:26.460 --> 55:29.899
Oh. Thanks.

55:30.060 --> 55:32.059
- 'Night.
- Good night.

55:40.100 --> 55:42.019
After our last lab assignment,

55:42.180 --> 55:45.179
Mr. Rope brought this
to my attention.

55:45.340 --> 55:48.059
It seems they found four
during locker-by-locker searches.

55:50.260 --> 55:53.419
Consequently, your lab partners
will be chosen alphabetically

55:53.620 --> 55:55.419
from now on.

56:02.140 --> 56:04.459
So, did you teach Chase

56:04.620 --> 56:06.939
to jump through
fiery hoops yet?

56:07.100 --> 56:08.779
Balance a ball on his nose?

56:08.940 --> 56:12.019
I'm still working
on matching socks.

56:12.220 --> 56:15.659
You two make
a very, very cute couple,

56:15.820 --> 56:19.019
but I guess you hear that
all the time.

56:20.980 --> 56:22.819
Why do you care?

56:23.020 --> 56:26.219
I don't.
you're welcome to him.

56:26.380 --> 56:28.179
I used to think he had some...

56:28.340 --> 56:30.739
I don't know...
some social consciousness.

56:30.900 --> 56:32.659
Is this the animal-testing thing?

56:32.820 --> 56:35.019
your concern is noted.

56:35.180 --> 56:37.259
Do you know anything
about his mother?

56:39.180 --> 56:41.819
Only that she died
when he was young...

56:41.980 --> 56:43.659
like 12 or something.

56:43.820 --> 56:46.699
11. you know how?

56:46.860 --> 56:48.579
No.

56:48.740 --> 56:51.339
Cancer.

56:51.500 --> 56:54.899
Lab rats,
medical research...

56:55.900 --> 56:57.899
Think about it.

57:16.020 --> 57:18.699
Hey, I finally downloaded
the original "Space Invaders."

57:18.860 --> 57:22.219
I'm talking quality 1981 graphics.
We gotta play tonight, man.

57:22.380 --> 57:23.739
yeah, I don't know.
I guess.

57:23.900 --> 57:26.699
Let's see what Chase wants to do.

57:27.700 --> 57:30.179
- What's up, man?
- What's up, man?

57:30.380 --> 57:33.979
I think he has to make an appearance
at Brad Seldon's party tonight.

57:34.180 --> 57:37.459
Oh, yeah.
Of course, of course.

57:39.500 --> 57:41.419
• Crazy... •

57:42.540 --> 57:45.539
So, this is the last
pre-centennial event for us.

57:45.700 --> 57:47.939
We're in the home stretch.

57:48.100 --> 57:51.699
Hey, did you say something
to Dulcie in lab?

57:51.900 --> 57:53.259
Why?

57:53.420 --> 57:55.459
I don't know.
She's been freaky around me.

57:55.660 --> 57:57.059
Nice, even.

57:57.220 --> 58:00.859
Well, mission
nearly accomplished then, huh?

58:01.020 --> 58:02.419
I guess.

58:02.620 --> 58:06.579
So, can I negotiate an entrance
with hand holding?

58:06.740 --> 58:10.579
• It's easy to see
you drive me crazy •

58:10.740 --> 58:13.739
• I just can't sleep •

58:13.900 --> 58:17.379
• I'm so excited,
I'm in too deep •

58:17.540 --> 58:20.099
• Oh oh oh, crazy •

58:20.260 --> 58:22.579
• But it feels all right •

58:22.740 --> 58:27.259
• Baby, thinking of you
keeps me up all night •

58:27.420 --> 58:30.219
- • Sing it! Oh •
- • Crazy... •

58:42.980 --> 58:46.339
Uh! Ha! yeah!

58:46.540 --> 58:49.259
• you can't mess with skills. •

58:54.740 --> 58:56.859
Hey, Nicole.

58:57.020 --> 58:58.939
Oh, hey, Brad.

58:59.140 --> 59:02.379
- I was just waiting for the bathroom.
- Yeah, that's cool.

59:05.140 --> 59:08.019
- So where's Kitty?
- Kathy.

59:08.180 --> 59:11.659
Right, Kathy.
I haven't seen her here tonight.

59:12.820 --> 59:14.699
She said we had different beliefs.

59:14.900 --> 59:17.819
And that was it.
Can you believe that?

59:17.980 --> 59:20.579
I mean, I'm Lutheran.

59:20.780 --> 59:24.459
So, it's like a fairy tale, right?

59:24.660 --> 59:27.699
- Huh?
- I mean, you and Nicole.

59:27.860 --> 59:29.979
Falling in love
with the girl next door.

59:30.140 --> 59:32.899
Oh, yeah. Right.

59:33.980 --> 59:36.339
Too bad.

59:37.340 --> 59:38.819
What's too bad?

59:38.980 --> 59:42.659
Well, you know,
that you're taken.

59:42.820 --> 59:46.659
I mean, who could have known
that underneath all that rebellion

59:46.820 --> 59:50.219
there was a heartbreaker
dying to get out?

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:06.379
Look at her in there.

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:10.939
Suddenly, Brad's on the market again,
and she's back to plan "A."

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:13.179
Old crushes die hard.

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:17.779
I wonder, are you sure
Nicole's the one?

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:24.019
Just think, if Brad hadn't fallen
into that cheerleader's arms,

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:28.179
Nicole would have gotten
exactly what she wanted.

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:33.019
Maybe then I would have gotten
what I wanted, too.

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:37.899
• Girl, your love is sweeter
than I've ever had before •

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:39.659
• Each and every day, girl •

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:42.339
• Always leaves me
wanting more •

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:45.179
• It's like sugar, sugar,
it's like honey, honey •

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:47.659
• It's even better than money... •

01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:50.899
Remember that night
you yelled at me in the car?

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:52.899
- Vaguely.
- All that stuff

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:55.579
that you said about love
being for dopes?

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:58.099
you were right.

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:07.099
Not in this lifetime, Romeo!

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:09.739
- Nicole's my friend.
- Huh?

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:21.459
Nicole.

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.819
Nicole!

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:35.099
Nicole.

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:41.819
• But we are two worlds apart •

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:45.739
• Can't reach to your heart •

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.459
• When you say •

01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:51.899
• I want it that way •

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:55.779
• Tell me why,
ain't nothing but a heartache... •

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:58.099
How could you do that?

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.619
I was testing him.

01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:03.139
Frankly, I think I did you a favor.

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:04.859
you weren't doing me a favor.

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:06.539
You're miserable,
and you know what they say

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.659
about misery loving company.

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.339
you just didn't wanna see me happy.

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.939
Chill, drama queen.

01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:15.059
Remember, it's not life and death.

01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:27.459
Are you okay?

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:29.499
I don't know.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.659
Oh, that's good.
That's good.

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:45.219
Reverse.

01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:48.099
Okay, let me really see
the pain.

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:57.219
you called?

01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:59.459
yeah, I called.

01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:01.099
- I'm staying.
- Why?

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:03.019
I like to party.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.939
I like to get down.

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:20.739
I got another note
from Daughter Judy.

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:26.259
Yeah, she says
she thinks I'm funny.

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:28.739
Ha-ha-ha.

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:34.299
So, who all was at the party?

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:36.299
Everybody.

01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:42.739
Oh!

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:46.259
Jesus! What the hell, Dave?

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:50.179
Look, sorry, but everybody
was not at the party.

01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:52.819
I wasn't there.
Ray wasn't there.

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:56.019
you know, we used to be your friends
if you can remember that far back.

01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:59.019
You know what
I remember, Dave?

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:01.779
I remember you cleaning out
Eddie Lampell's locker

01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:03.259
because he said
he'd be your friend.

01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:04.579
yeah, I did the guy a favor.

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.099
I remember you buying
Alicia DeGasario

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:07.939
at the student council auction
last year

01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:10.379
and then letting her spend
the whole day with her boyfriend.

01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:12.419
- Do you have a point?
- yeah, my point is, Dave,

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:15.779
you're not mad at me;
you're jealous.

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:19.139
What's wrong with wanting
to be liked?

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:20.819
You want them
to like you, Dave?

01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:23.259
Tell them to go fuck themselves.

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:25.099
People like that
need people like you,

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:28.139
otherwise there's twice as much trash
and no one to take it out.

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:31.259
you're totally losing me.

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:36.899
Don't go, Dave.

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:39.379
There's sober people there.

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:41.259
They just don't wanna
leave the party.

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:44.139
I can't not go.

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:49.379
This is close enough.
I wanted to walk anyway.

01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:10.659
Come on, baby. Come on.

01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:13.699
- Cut it out, Eddie. Stop.
- What?

01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:16.899
No one's gonna know about it.
Come on.

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:20.019
Sorry, Dave, I would have driven
him home, but I can't drive his car.

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:22.019
It's a stick.

01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:24.659
Well, I'll show you
how to drive a stick right now.

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:25.939
Here it is. Come on.

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:29.139
I meant a real car, Eddie,
not a Matchbox.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:33.179
yeah, well, kiss my ass,
you once-fat bitch.

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.699
I remember
when you were nothing.

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:38.659
Just a sweaty little egghead
drooling over football players.

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:41.139
Now you think that because
you're Mrs. Time Zone

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:43.339
- that your shit don't stink.
- Miss Time Zone.

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:45.499
yeah, whatever.
Shut up!

01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:47.739
you think you're Miss Thing,
but you know what?

01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:50.979
you're just a wannabe who got lucky
with a case of bulimia.

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:54.659
you're walking.
Hey, Dee, you all right?

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:57.299
I think so.
Eddie, stop it!

01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:00.979
What are you thinking,
Designated Dave, huh?

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:03.219
This isn't
"Revenge of the Nerds," man.

01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:05.299
Stop it, Eddie, stop!

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:07.059
No radioactive spider bit you.

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:09.219
Stop!

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:11.619
Get your ass up
and drive me home.

01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:15.219
And you...

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:21.579
Sorry.
you wanna get out of here?

01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:23.979
Can you bring me back
to the party, please, Dave?

01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:26.419
- I need to talk to Sue.
- Okay.

01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:05.779
Maya Angelou...
"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings."

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:08.739
- Really, you do?
- Chase, you're not listening.

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:10.659
Some parents wanna take it off
the ninth grade reading list

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:13.859
because they think that...

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:15.659
Chase.

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:22.979
Why are telling me this?

01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:25.139
I'm your past-tense
quasi-boyfriend,

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:27.419
not the American people.

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:29.659
Well, what I'm trying to say

01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:33.179
is that both the tense and title
are negotiable.

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:44.059
Okay, 10 seconds.

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:56.899
Candy... we're not supposed
to eat it in school,

01:07:57.060 --> 01:08:00.299
yet clubs sell everything
from M&Ms to breath fresheners.

01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:02.499
Today, our investigative report...

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:04.859
"Dollars and Certs."

01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:10.419
The marching band
couldn't march without it.

01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:13.019
Cheerleaders couldn't cheer
without it...

01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:15.299
Nicole...

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:17.979
about Friday night...

01:08:19.859 --> 01:08:21.499
It's called an easy-out clause,
Chase,

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:23.698
'cause it's supposed
to be easy.

01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:29.979
So that's it, huh?

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:32.738
you need more closure than this?

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:34.538
No.

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.099
Guess not.

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:39.139
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:46.738
• I'm in with the in-crowd •

01:08:46.899 --> 01:08:50.658
• I go where the in-crowd goes •

01:08:50.819 --> 01:08:53.899
• I'm in with the in-crowd •

01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:58.179
• And I know
what the in-crowd loves... •

01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:00.738
• Any time of the year •

01:09:00.899 --> 01:09:04.219
• Don't you hear... •

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:07.099
Go! Fight! Win!

01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:10.219
• We cruise up and down
the street... •

01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:15.099
• We get respect
from the people we meet... •

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:18.179
• Baby! •

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:22.459
Hey!

01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:24.499
Just give me the key!

01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:29.618
Ugh!

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:38.618
Okay, we're on Wednesday at 8:00,

01:09:38.819 --> 01:09:41.139
Thursday at 8:00,
Friday at 8:05.

01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:43.859
8:05?

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:48.899
Not so fast, Ray Neeley.

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:51.859
I want the guilty party
brought to my office now! Right now!

01:09:53.779 --> 01:09:55.539
Can I just tell you I heard
from one of the office aides

01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:57.939
they gave Ray three weeks
of in-school suspension.

01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:00.459
They should have kicked his ass
all the way out.

01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:03.539
Have you ever talked to the guy?
He is such a complete loser.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:06.099
It just figures that he would do
something like this. Stupid-ass.

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:09.299
Sue, he's gonna be winning
MTV Awards

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:12.459
while you're still
the local weathergirl.

01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:14.499
Well, I guess it's easy
to be a bitch

01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:16.739
now that Brad Seldon's
available again.

01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:19.659
It's easy to be a bitch either way.

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:23.859
• If it's coming over you •

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:26.219
• Like it's coming over me... •

01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:28.619
• I'm crashing like a tidal wave... •

01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:31.339
• That drags me out to sea •

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:34.179
• And I wanna be with you •

01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:37.019
• And you wanna be with me •

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:39.699
• I'm crashing like a tidal wave... •

01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:42.579
• I don't wanna be •

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.099
• Stranded •

01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:48.179
• Stranded, stranded, stranded •

01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:50.379
• Stranded, stranded •

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:54.899
• Stranded, stranded... •

01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:57.219
• Stranded, stranded •

01:10:57.380 --> 01:11:01.019
• Stranded, stranded, stranded •

01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:04.939
• Stranded, stranded •

01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:12.139
• If it's coming over you
like it's coming over me... •

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:13.859
- Hey.
- Hey, Brad.

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:16.939
- • I'm crashing like a tidal wave... •
- Everything all right?

01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:20.379
Uh, listen, so about the dance...

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:23.019
what do you think?

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:26.339
• I'm crashing like a tidal wave •

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:29.539
• I don't wanna be •

01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:32.139
• Stranded •

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:36.459
• Stranded, stranded, stranded •

01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:41.379
• Stranded, stranded •

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:44.259
• Oh, baby, I miss you •

01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:46.659
• Stranded, stranded •

01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:48.419
• Oh, baby, I need you •

01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:50.179
• Stranded, stranded. •

01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:51.899
Centennial weekend is here.

01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:54.459
It's time you'll wanna share
with a special someone

01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:56.859
because it truly is
a once-in-a-lifetime event.

01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:59.539
On behalf of the entire
Centennial Dance Committee,

01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:03.139
we look forward to seeing you there
in your formalwear.

01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:05.899
That's a cut.
All right, Ray, let's reset.

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.899
- Is that all you need?
- yeah, that was great, thanks.

01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:11.059
These will air
all day tomorrow.

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.699
Hey, that sounded good.

01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:15.419
It was bullshit.

01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:19.219
"Share it with someone special."
That's not reality.

01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:23.299
I'm really sorry about Chase.

01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:25.939
I should've known better.

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:27.579
My dad did it to my mom.

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:29.619
Eddie did it to you.

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:32.419
What's the point?

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:35.619
you can't give up, Nicole.

01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:37.819
Why not?
I'm through with it... all of it.

01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:40.179
yeah, but didn't Brad finally
ask you to centennial?

01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:43.219
That's what you've been wanting
all along, isn't it?

01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:45.499
That's the twisted part.

01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:51.099
I finally got what I wanted,
but it doesn't matter anymore.

01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:53.819
Dee, you're up next.

01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:09.979
Cowabunga, dudes.

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:11.619
I'm thinking about college.

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.859
you're accepted.
What's left to worry about?

01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:18.299
I'm thinking that maybe I should go
to an East Coast school.

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:21.139
you know, somewhere where
no one knows me.

01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:24.659
Someplace where I'm not
Designated Dave.

01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:27.819
Why don't you go to State
as planned

01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:29.979
and let Designated Dave

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:34.259
go off to Long Island
Junior College?

01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:38.459
Hey, guess who got asked

01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:42.379
to the centennial extravaganza?

01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:44.579
Who's the lucky lady?

01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:46.339
Daughter Judy.

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:49.539
- Oh, virtually a date.
- Virtually?

01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:54.019
She's gonna email me her address
right before the dance.

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.379
Are you going?

01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:58.179
Oh, he was going.

01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:03.019
Oh, you mean the horribly freakish
distorted version of your former self?

01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:05.539
yeah.

01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:07.899
But now you're back.

01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:12.419
Centennial weekend is here.

01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:14.299
It's time you'll wanna share
with a special someone

01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:17.019
because it truly is
a once-in-a-lifetime event.

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:19.299
On behalf of the entire
Centennial Dance Committee,

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:22.179
we look forward to seeing you there
in your formalwear.

01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:34.579
Nicole, I'm leaving for the dance now.

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:36.779
you almost ready?

01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:05.219
Okay, here we go.

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.379
Whoa.

01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:29.699
• you only go around once •

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:33.579
• On this big
spinning planet of love •

01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:35.419
• So don't be wasting my time •

01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:38.939
• Telling me
what you're dreaming of •

01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:42.099
• We'll take a rocket to the moon
and when we get that far •

01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:44.779
• I'll hang your coat and hat
upon a shooting star •

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:46.899
• So let's live it up,
let's live it up •

01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:50.179
• Let's live it up •

01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:54.459
• Hang up the cat
and put the dog out to dry •

01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:56.819
• My, my,
roll up the bird •

01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:00.019
• Let the alligator wave bye-bye... •

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:01.979
Nicole, this place is amazing.

01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:03.779
I mean, you really pulled it off.

01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:05.459
Thanks, Ray.

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:07.019
And thanks for coming through
at the last minute.

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:08.979
Well, of course.

01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:11.659
you deserve to be here.
It's the best.

01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:17.699
you know,
and you look beautiful.

01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:22.379
Come on,
let's go spike the punch.

01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:24.699
By the way, I like your hair.

01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:36.659
Nicole, I'm honestly sorry
about how things worked out.

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:39.979
I really thought Brad
was gonna ask you.

01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:42.779
He did,
but I already had a date.

01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:45.779
He was bummed,
so I let him know you were easy.

01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:40.739
• yesterday. •

01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:08.979
Nicole?

01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:12.259
Dad?

01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:16.619
Weren't you supposed
to be in Rio?

01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:19.179
No, I'm exactly
where I'm supposed to be.

01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:21.659
For once.

01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:24.299
Gotta start somewhere.

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:32.659
Ray, this is my dad.

01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:34.979
Oh, yeah? Wow.
It's good to meet you.

01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:36.459
It's a pleasure, Ray.

01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:38.179
Hey, you must be
real proud of Nicole...

01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:41.179
her dreaming this up
and putting it all together.

01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:46.259
Wow.

01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:49.299
It's not bad, is it?

01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:51.739
No, not bad at all.

01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:53.779
Okay, have fun.

01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:57.059
I'm going up to the balcony
with the rest of the aged.

01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:00.499
Dinner tomorrow night?

01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:03.499
Pick me up at 7:00?

01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:06.739
Okay. See ya.

01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:26.739
And now...

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:31.179
And now, to officially
get the party started,

01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:33.499
it's time for the dedication

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:36.739
of the senior class
centennial gift.

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:39.419
To share in the unveiling,

01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:41.499
I am proud to present

01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:45.699
our own Mr. and Miss Time Zone.

01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:51.339
First up,
Mr. Time Zone himself...

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:53.859
Mr. Brad Seldon...

01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:57.419
accompanied by

01:19:57.580 --> 01:20:00.179
Alicia DeGasario.

01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:08.739
And now
Miss Time Zone herself...

01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:11.379
Miss Judy Vine,

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:14.059
accompanied by her escort...

01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:19.939
Dave!

01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:22.579
...Dave Ednasi.

01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:30.219
- Whoo!
- Dave! Whoo-hoo!

01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:34.099
And now, a moment 100 years
in the making.

01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:37.259
Our senior class
is proud to present...

01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:39.819
Our centennial sculpture.

01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:05.179
Ladies and gentlemen,
Chase Hammond.

01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:24.259
• See that boy,
he looks so fine •

01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:26.059
• But he's got a girlfriend,
my, oh, my... •

01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:29.099
The Electrocutes!
Why didn't you tell me?

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:31.859
I wanted it to be a surprise.

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:34.779
They don't sound like Brandy.

01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:37.059
That was pretty cool.

01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:47.979
• Get rid of that girl •

01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:50.179
• Get rid of that girl. •

01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:00.619
I'm glad it was you
at my door tonight.

01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:02.379
Real glad.

01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:14.939
Ray, I'm really having
a good time.

01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:18.859
Man, that makes this
kind of tough to say.

01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:20.979
What?

01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:26.979
Well, it's a far,
far better thing I do

01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:29.699
than I have ever done.

01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:32.259
Ray, it was all a scam.

01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:34.339
yeah. Well, it worked.

01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:43.219
• you should have seen
by the look in my eyes... •

01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:46.619
Dad, what are you doing here?

01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:50.619
Dancing.
What are you doing here?

01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:53.939
Dancing.

01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:57.819
- Very good.
- • But you didn't listen •

01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:04.379
• You played dead,
but you never bled •

01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:07.579
• Instead you laid still
in the grass •

01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:10.739
• All coiled up and hissing... •

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:19.499
I was gonna ask to cut in.

01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:21.379
Where's Ray?

01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:24.859
Gone. But you've got
my permission.

01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:27.019
I'm sure you can still catch him.

01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:32.739
Actually, I was gonna ask
to dance with you.

01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:37.419
Really?

01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:42.899
• And we're still together... •

01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:47.699
• And I meant •

01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:49.219
• Every word I said •

01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:51.819
• When I said that I loved you... •

01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:54.499
So, who are we making jealous?

01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:56.819
Everyone, Nicole.

01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:58.379
Everyone.

01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:03.139
• And I'm gonna keep on
loving you •

01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:07.419
• 'Cause it's the only thing
I wanna do •

01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:11.459
• I don't wanna sleep •

01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:15.019

loving you •

01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:22.539

• I wanna
keep on loving you •

01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:31.779
• I wanna keep on loving you. •

01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:37.139
I don't know that I've ever
been walked to my door before.

01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:40.099
Oh, well, I rented the limo.

01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:41.939
I get to be the guy.

01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:43.659
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:46.899
So, I guess that
makes me the girl, huh?

01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:48.579
Right.

01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:55.419
Well, Nicole, I...

01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:57.979
I had a really lovely time.

01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:01.899
- Call me?
- yeah, whatever.

01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:26.619
Mom?

01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:31.699
Oh, that must have been
an interesting evening.

- Oh.

01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:42.379
- Should we tell 'em?
- yeah.

01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:45.859
- We're moving in together.
- yeah.

01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:51.099
Obviously, we all need to think
about what this means.

01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:55.179
Sure, well...

01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:57.459
Tell you what... why don't you two
think about it here

01:25:57.620 --> 01:25:59.419
