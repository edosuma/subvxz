00:08.049 --> 00:09.802
<i>Previously on "You Me Her"...</i>

00:09.844 --> 00:11.219
I don't know what you think you heard --

00:11.261 --> 00:13.305
You mean the part about Izzy not being your niece

00:13.347 --> 00:15.349
or the part about you guys paying her to have pervy

00:15.390 --> 00:17.935
three  No.

00:17.977 --> 00:20.020
We got some negotiating to do, don't we?

00:20.061 --> 00:22.230
Aaaaaaaaah!

00:22.272 --> 00:23.983
Weinstock is retiring as dean,

00:24.023 --> 00:25.901
and he's recommending me as his replacement?

00:25.943 --> 00:28.028
It won't be official until the alumni board approves it.

00:29.488 --> 00:32.616
Lori has just accepted a seat

00:32.658 --> 00:35.703
on the prestigious Hamilton School Alumni Board.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.162
Izzy really digs you guys.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.706
What

00:38.747 --> 00:40.749
-She say that to you, or -- -Shitheads, focus.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.501
We're gonna do something other than sex.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.043
We're gonna hang out together.

00:44.085 --> 00:46.881
Emma: Maybe this is doable, the road less traveled,

00:46.922 --> 00:49.758
the relationship more populated.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.176
Why does it have to be scary?

00:51.218 --> 00:53.012
This is you inviting me to move in?

00:53.052 --> 00:54.262
Jack: I'm actually confused.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.389
Did you think this was permanent?

00:55.430 --> 00:57.016
You don't deserve me.

01:05.983 --> 01:08.694
It's okay.

01:08.736 --> 01:12.573
This doesn't change anything, Trakarskys.

01:12.614 --> 01:17.285
Our arrangement continues, even if that one's over.

01:17.327 --> 01:19.120
Honey, just let it go.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.748
I'll scream.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.082
You know, I'll -- I'll tell my mom.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.375
Oh, I dare you.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.752
No, I double fuckin' dare you.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.128
Go back inside and tell Mommy right now.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.923
But know this, and know it real good.

01:28.964 --> 01:31.216
You are gonna have two adults right across the street from you

01:31.258 --> 01:34.595
spending every waking moment plotting your hideous ruination,

01:34.636 --> 01:37.681
and those adults know dozens and dozens of other adults,

01:37.723 --> 01:39.433
many in the fields of higher education

01:39.474 --> 01:41.142
and law enforcement. And here's the cherry

01:41.184 --> 01:42.937
on the top of your shit sundae, little girl.

01:42.978 --> 01:44.312
A lot of them would leap at the chance

01:44.354 --> 01:46.982
to take down a smug, over-entitled Ava.

01:47.024 --> 01:50.235
That's right. Your name will become the darkest of insults.

01:50.277 --> 01:54.155
"Oh, my God. She is, like, such an Ava."

01:56.199 --> 01:58.744
And while I've never played the game myself,

01:58.786 --> 02:03.540
I hear soccer is so much easier to play with two healthy legs.

02:03.582 --> 02:07.335
So you can narc us out, or you can sleep, little girl.

02:07.377 --> 02:10.839
But I wouldn't recommend both.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.633
Do you know what I mean?

02:14.051 --> 02:16.136
-Y-Yes.

02:16.177 --> 02:17.679
-Okay. -Yes, ma'am.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.264
I'm glad we understand each other,

02:19.306 --> 02:21.600
and don't call me ma'am, you little shit.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.185
Let's go make a goddamn baby.

02:27.106 --> 02:28.983
Go to bed, little girl.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.859
Okay.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.612
Shit.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.657
♪♪

02:49.920 --> 02:51.170
Jack: I'm sorry, honey.

02:51.212 --> 02:52.380
I mean, I was totally feeling it,

02:52.422 --> 02:53.674
and then I just wasn't.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.092
Emma: It was a dumb idea.

02:55.134 --> 02:58.345
Izzy peeled out of our lives like 10 minutes ago.

02:58.386 --> 02:59.930
Was it a mistake?

02:59.972 --> 03:03.517
What

03:05.894 --> 03:09.023
Either way, I don't know.

03:09.064 --> 03:11.190
I mean, maybe it was inevitable.

03:11.232 --> 03:12.860
You know, maybe it never could've worked.

03:12.901 --> 03:15.445
It's not what people do.

03:15.487 --> 03:16.697
Is that a reason to not do something,

03:16.738 --> 03:19.282
just because other people don't?

03:19.324 --> 03:22.911
Honestly, yeah, I think maybe it is.

03:22.953 --> 03:25.122
Yeah.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.886
"Home Seekers."

03:38.927 --> 03:40.137
Oh, my God. That sounds so good right now.

03:40.179 --> 03:43.223
Doesn't it?

03:53.067 --> 03:55.443
Izzy: Fucking idiot!

03:58.363 --> 03:59.907
Here we go again.

04:07.164 --> 04:09.583
Oh, you look troubled, Iz.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.004
I, uh --

04:14.046 --> 04:16.006
I smoked everything in the house.

04:16.048 --> 04:19.134
So 10 minutes earlier,

04:19.176 --> 04:21.469
you would've caught me apple-bonging chamomile

04:21.511 --> 04:24.723
and a dead house plant.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.433
So it's over this time?

04:26.474 --> 04:28.936
Like, for real?

04:28.977 --> 04:31.688
Yeah.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.941
Do you want to tell me about it?

04:33.982 --> 04:35.984
Do I really have to?

04:36.026 --> 04:39.362
No. The whole affair was a sprawling field of peril.

04:39.404 --> 04:44.243
Doesn't really matter what IED you stepped on.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.954
So are you sad?

04:46.995 --> 04:50.415
Humiliated?

04:50.457 --> 04:54.086
Angry?

04:54.128 --> 04:56.463
Exhausted?

04:58.506 --> 05:00.341
Humiliated, mostly.

05:04.096 --> 05:06.056
I had an epiphany

05:06.098 --> 05:08.142
while I was standing there in my pajamas

05:08.183 --> 05:10.769
in the middle of suburbia

05:10.811 --> 05:14.773
surrounded by normal families living normal lives.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.278
They didn't feel the way that I felt.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.908
They were bored, and I was just something different.

05:30.956 --> 05:34.209
I almost got married when I was 18.

05:34.251 --> 05:35.502
No way.

05:35.543 --> 05:40.590
<i>Tres</i> Appalachian, eh?

05:40.632 --> 05:44.636
Yeah. I was so in love

05:44.678 --> 05:50.433
that I couldn't eat or sleep or breathe.

05:50.475 --> 05:53.270
It just, like, sat right on my chest, you know?

05:55.856 --> 05:59.067
Yeah, we even found this cute little hippie church in Sonoma.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.821
What happened?

06:02.863 --> 06:05.157
Well, the exact date

06:05.199 --> 06:06.908
that we were gonna escape

06:06.950 --> 06:09.036
into our three-dimensional YA trilogy...

06:11.705 --> 06:13.290
...he told me that he should probably go

06:13.332 --> 06:16.918
to this Brown University place.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.337
Lame.

06:18.377 --> 06:20.797
My bags were packed when he told me.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.008
Yeah.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.425
Yeah, I think back,

06:24.467 --> 06:28.930
and I realized that he was just,

06:28.972 --> 06:32.391
like, too hot, you know?

06:32.433 --> 06:34.019
Truth.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.104
You can't trust men with that much power.

06:36.146 --> 06:39.440
Mmh-mnh.

06:39.482 --> 06:42.152
No.

06:43.486 --> 06:48.616
And when I want to, for whatever sick reason,

06:48.658 --> 06:52.579
I can still feel what I felt then,

06:52.620 --> 06:55.707
just like I'm dead inside,

06:55.749 --> 06:57.500
you know?

06:57.542 --> 07:00.712
So, um, Lee put an entire continent between us,

07:00.754 --> 07:02.421
and I went full-on "Yellow Wallpaper."

07:02.463 --> 07:04.632
I drove across the country

07:04.674 --> 07:06.927
like that batshit astronaut chick,

07:06.968 --> 07:09.512
minus the diapers 'cause that's sick.

07:12.766 --> 07:16.019
But when he looked at me,

07:16.061 --> 07:18.563
he just felt pity,

07:18.605 --> 07:22.401
not love or the slightest bit of uncertainty --

07:22.442 --> 07:24.111
just pity.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.653
I knew, in 10 years,

07:25.695 --> 07:28.990
that he would tell the story and get my name wrong.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.997
I, um...

07:36.039 --> 07:39.293
I got back in my car, and I just drove.

07:42.503 --> 07:45.840
I never wanted to tell you that.

07:45.882 --> 07:50.262
But it's part of who I am, and I -- I knew that --

07:50.304 --> 07:52.055
I knew that you could never really know me

07:52.097 --> 07:53.681
if I didn't tell you.

07:58.437 --> 07:59.896
I'm really glad you did.

07:59.938 --> 08:03.317
Me too, surprisingly.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.199
So what's the moral?

08:11.241 --> 08:15.120
The moral is, it gets better.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.080
It hurt a little less by the time I got home,

08:17.122 --> 08:18.373
and a lot less

08:18.415 --> 08:20.834
after I fucked Trey Larker into a coma.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.922
Let me guess

08:25.964 --> 08:28.258
Best friend.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.676
So, what, I'm just supposed to

08:29.717 --> 08:32.429
fuck all the Trakarskys' neighbors?

08:32.471 --> 08:34.306
God, no, Izzy.

08:34.348 --> 08:36.641
You're hopeless.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.226
Just the ones they like.

08:40.228 --> 08:41.855
You're awful.

08:46.943 --> 08:50.489
♪♪

09:06.129 --> 09:07.922
Oh.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.719
Ohh.

09:12.760 --> 09:16.223
Did you know I was all

09:16.264 --> 09:17.974
-No. -Uh-huh.

09:22.687 --> 09:23.730
Okay.

09:23.771 --> 09:26.483
That was a lie.

09:26.525 --> 09:29.444
I'm just a small-boned woman standing in your bedroom

09:29.486 --> 09:32.280
in the middle of the night with a baseball bat.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.159
Lori found out.

09:36.201 --> 09:38.870
No, I -- I didn't tell. I swear.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.081
Maybe, maybe not.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.874
But I refuse to be the kind of woman

09:42.916 --> 09:46.336
who doesn't follow through on her psychotic threats.

09:46.378 --> 09:48.088
This might take a few tries.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.506
No! No!

09:49.548 --> 09:51.883
-Ava. -Oh, my God.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.261
God. You're all sweaty.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.678
Ew. You -- You weren't just --

09:55.720 --> 09:57.055
No, Mom. What do you --

09:57.097 --> 10:00.475
What do you want? -Well, call me crazy...

10:00.517 --> 10:03.978
You're whatever's<i> after</i> crazy.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.731
...but this whole "niece that fell from the sky" issue

10:06.773 --> 10:08.942
continues to bother me.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.027
Do you ever wonder if you're blinded

10:11.069 --> 10:12.612
by unhealthy vindictiveness

10:12.653 --> 10:14.697
for all the times the cool kids left you out?

10:14.739 --> 10:16.074
Hmm?

10:16.116 --> 10:17.951
That you're overstepping the call of duty,

10:17.992 --> 10:20.370
and maybe it's time you just let it go?

10:20.412 --> 10:22.247
Um...

10:22.289 --> 10:23.790
okay.

10:23.831 --> 10:27.043
That was both impressive and emotionally eviscerating.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.087
Quite the wake-up call.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.424
And I promise to turn my scrutiny inwards.

10:34.634 --> 10:38.805
Right after you find Jacqueline Isabelle's last name

10:38.846 --> 10:43.059
and any social-networking site or something

10:43.101 --> 10:45.103
that proves her and Jack's big sister

10:45.145 --> 10:47.230
could pick each other out of a line-up,

10:47.272 --> 10:49.023
let alone share DNA.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.567
Okay?

10:50.609 --> 10:52.569
So you're pressing snooze on my wake

10:52.611 --> 10:54.028
Just do it for me, please,

10:54.070 --> 10:56.030
for the woman who willed your abnormally large head

10:56.072 --> 10:57.365
out of her vagina.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.367
-God, gross. -And it'll all be over,

10:59.409 --> 11:03.622
and I will make nice with the neighbors.

11:14.466 --> 11:15.674
Mm.

11:26.727 --> 11:29.397
What if the world deems us unworthy of procreating?

11:29.439 --> 11:30.773
What then?

11:33.443 --> 11:34.819
What?

11:34.861 --> 11:38.448
Where's this coming from?

11:38.490 --> 11:40.074
Then we'll find another program

11:40.116 --> 11:43.620
or -- or we'll adopt, or both.

11:43.662 --> 11:45.372
Okay.

11:45.413 --> 11:49.626
Yeah, and then -- I mean, and long after our children

11:49.668 --> 11:51.127
find us either too embarrassing

11:51.169 --> 11:53.129
or too irritating to hang out with anymore,

11:53.171 --> 11:55.632
and long after Izzy has moved on with another guy

11:55.674 --> 11:57.175
and another family,

11:57.217 --> 12:00.136
this story will still be about you and me,

12:00.178 --> 12:01.638
Em, okay?

12:01.680 --> 12:05.225
Always was, always will be.

12:06.976 --> 12:10.938
Yeah. That is a very good line.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.731
And we're back.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.910
-I didn't hear anything.

12:23.951 --> 12:26.287
Me neither.

12:31.918 --> 12:35.754
Do you think it might be Izzy, or...

12:35.796 --> 12:37.965
Okay.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.678
Move. We got to talk.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.012
Having trouble sleeping?

12:43.054 --> 12:45.432
No, no, having trouble with Lori.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.392
It's past midnight. What

12:47.434 --> 12:49.185
Lori has assigned me to use the interwebs

12:49.227 --> 12:52.439
to find out whether Izzy is or isn't your niece.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.899
-Shit. -She knows I can do it.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.234
I can do it.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.860
Okay. So why aren't you?

12:57.902 --> 13:01.989
It's an opportunity to shut her down permanently.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.908
All we need is to see Izzy, you, and your sister

13:03.950 --> 13:05.118
together in a picture.

13:05.159 --> 13:06.661
Oh, no. That's impossible.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.580
That picture doesn't exist.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.459
Which is why you're here.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.792
There you go.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.378
I get it.

13:15.420 --> 13:18.298
First, we catfish a page under Jacqueline Isabelle,

13:18.339 --> 13:20.799
uh, whatever your sister's last name is.

13:20.841 --> 13:21.968
-Deering. -Deering.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.595
Okay.

13:23.637 --> 13:26.931
And Izzy? -Uh, Silva.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.141
Okay.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.351
I already started an account.

13:30.393 --> 13:33.854
I just have to lift some images from Izzy.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.942
Bam. Done.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.153
Jacqueline Isabelle Deering now exists.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.904
Wow, just

13:41.946 --> 13:43.990
Just like that.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.700
-Wow. -Weird.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.868
I can't find a home page for Jack Trakarsky.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.663
-I don't have a page. -Yeah, me neither.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.872
Never -- Never really saw the point.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.669
What?

13:55.710 --> 13:57.545
I have some pictures on my phone I could text you.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.005
Send them to me right now.

13:59.046 --> 14:00.047
Why are you helping us?

14:00.089 --> 14:03.176
Gee, Emma, I don't know.

14:03.217 --> 14:05.679
Maybe because you're a homicidal psychopath.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.597
-Yeah, she is. -No, stop.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.140
And I'd like to sleep at some point

14:09.182 --> 14:10.891
in the not-too-distant future.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.561
Text the picture, Jack. -I'm trying.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.355
I just want to put this thing behind me.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.190
Ava, I'm sorry.

14:17.231 --> 14:20.527
I hope you know that I would never --

14:20.568 --> 14:22.028
You never what?

14:22.069 --> 14:24.864
She would never really want to go back to prison

14:24.905 --> 14:26.825
for hurting people.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.536
She's very dangerous, this one.

14:29.577 --> 14:30.745
Yep.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.372
Whatever.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.671
Hey, Neen.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.298
Mm

14:42.340 --> 14:44.718
I'm gonna go home.

14:44.759 --> 14:47.011
You are home.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.848
No, like,<i> home</i> home.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.432
As in Colorado.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.663
Yeah, whatever happened to click, bam?

15:13.705 --> 15:15.998
I'm not exactly a Photoshop wizard.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.461
Click, bam, bitches.

15:20.503 --> 15:22.505
There you go.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.799
Oh, yeah. It's done.

15:24.841 --> 15:28.094
See, look.

15:28.135 --> 15:30.137
Ah, what do you think?

15:32.766 --> 15:34.726
The bitches are not impressed.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.060
Really?

15:36.102 --> 15:38.229
Well, I think it works.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.356
Like, there's you.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.982
There's your sister. And there's Izzy.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.778
And she's standing behind, like, on a box or something.

15:44.819 --> 15:47.113
Yeah, because people do that a lot in candid photos.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.615
She's fuckin' enormous.

15:48.656 --> 15:52.702
I mean, do you have no idea about proportion?

15:52.744 --> 15:54.788
I think it's pretty good, so...

15:54.829 --> 15:56.038
Oh, my God.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.665
It's a generational thing, honey.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.125
I see it all the time at school.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.376
I mean, kids these days, they take a shit,

16:00.418 --> 16:02.002
and they think it's art.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.589
I mean, we see the picture as is, as it really is.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.633
She sees something totally different.

16:06.674 --> 16:10.177
It's like a millennial ocular ego filter,

16:10.219 --> 16:11.846
a MOEF.

16:11.888 --> 16:14.641
Yeah, but, Jack, that is so bad. That is so bad.

16:14.682 --> 16:15.934
It looks like Izzy's the dead sister

16:15.975 --> 16:17.644
who keeps showing up in family photos.

16:17.685 --> 16:18.978
Do you actually think this is good?

16:19.019 --> 16:20.563
You think Lori's gonna buy this?

16:20.605 --> 16:22.816
-Absolutely, yes. -This is fascinating.

16:22.857 --> 16:25.067
What are we going to do?

16:25.109 --> 16:26.653
This is an emergency, honey.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.906
We need to call a professional.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.658
I'm awesome.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.702
♪♪

16:38.915 --> 16:41.125
You're really not gonna help me?

16:41.167 --> 16:42.877
Nope.

16:46.213 --> 16:48.842
You're acting like a child.

16:48.883 --> 16:51.469
Uh, am I the one running home to my mom?

16:53.763 --> 16:56.390
It's the middle of the semester.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.560
Whatever, like I should ever counsel other human beings.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.437
And more importantly, it's Halloween.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.147
You and I were supposed to be those freaky little twins

17:03.189 --> 17:05.650
from "The Shining," except way sluttier.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.902
It doesn't work as a solo act.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.696
You're wearing pigtails, Mary Janes,

17:09.737 --> 17:12.239
and a toddler's dress that shows your cooch.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.867
I think it'll work.

17:13.908 --> 17:15.368
Just come on, Iz.

17:15.409 --> 17:18.204
You can leave tomorrow, okay?

17:18.245 --> 17:19.789
I'll get you wasted.

17:19.831 --> 17:23.710
We can profess our drunk sisterly love to one another.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.628
You'll decide to stay, and then we'll just find you,

17:25.670 --> 17:28.798
like, a perfectly good shrink right here in Portland.

17:30.925 --> 17:33.386
Do you want this?

17:33.427 --> 17:35.179
No.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.100
I bought a ticket online

17:40.142 --> 17:41.686
for a flight that leaves tomorrow night,

17:41.728 --> 17:43.980
which is technically tonight,

17:44.022 --> 17:45.773
and I have to be on it.

17:48.275 --> 17:49.903
Why would you do that?

17:49.944 --> 17:52.947
-Nina. -Don't.

17:52.989 --> 17:55.658
Oh, my gosh.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.953
Super mature.

17:58.995 --> 18:01.873
Nina, come on, man.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.250
These last six days,

18:04.291 --> 18:05.668
Andy,

18:05.710 --> 18:09.171
a staggering amount of THC and alcohol,

18:09.213 --> 18:11.298
the Trakarskys,

18:11.340 --> 18:14.093
a fucking "C" on a lame-ass philosophy midterm.

18:14.134 --> 18:16.178
I mean, these are all just symptoms

18:16.220 --> 18:20.934
of way bigger shit that I have to work out.

18:20.975 --> 18:23.644
Nina, will you please look at me?

18:23.686 --> 18:26.022
No.

18:26.064 --> 18:29.483
Well, you're in a swivel chair, so...

18:29.525 --> 18:32.612
Stop it.

18:32.653 --> 18:33.821
Get your hands out of your face.

18:33.863 --> 18:36.240
Unh-unh.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.159
Nina, stop it.

18:40.703 --> 18:43.706
I had sex with a married couple,

18:43.748 --> 18:46.709
and I fell in love with them in, like, a matter of days.

18:46.751 --> 18:49.837
And then I went to their house in my pajamas

18:49.879 --> 18:53.382
with a bag full of drugs and a karaoke machine.

18:53.424 --> 18:56.135
So? People do that all the time.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.344
No, they don't.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.305
Yes, they do.

18:59.346 --> 19:01.015
They really don't.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.271
It's fucked up.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.023
Yeah.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.025
I just --

19:13.111 --> 19:18.282
I just need to get back to the source, you know?

19:18.324 --> 19:20.660
Get things right with my mom.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.037
Shit, maybe even with my dad.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.831
Can you understand that?

19:28.084 --> 19:29.293
We have the whole day together.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.753
And you need to help me pack

19:30.795 --> 19:33.047
because half of this stuff is yours, okay?

19:33.089 --> 19:34.507
And then -- and then you can just --

19:34.548 --> 19:35.842
you can pour me onto the plane

19:35.883 --> 19:37.259
and make your entrance to the party

19:37.301 --> 19:39.887
fetishitically late.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.848
Okay?

19:41.889 --> 19:45.225
Okay. So when are you coming back?

19:45.267 --> 19:48.855
Like, after the break, or Thanksgiving?

19:48.896 --> 19:50.606
Izzy.

19:53.442 --> 19:57.864
Okay, let me rephrase and speak more slowly.

19:57.905 --> 20:02.242
How long are you staying in Colorado?

20:04.078 --> 20:08.499
Um...

20:11.085 --> 20:12.962
It's a one-way ticket.

20:16.590 --> 20:20.053
I just -- I need to stay away for a while.

20:20.094 --> 20:22.763
Away from what?

20:22.805 --> 20:24.557
Jack and Emma.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.311
You want to prove that girl

20:29.353 --> 20:31.147
is the Trakarskys' sexual plaything,

20:31.189 --> 20:33.066
publicly ostracize them,

20:33.107 --> 20:35.568
and destroy Jack's career in retaliation

20:35.609 --> 20:37.862
for keeping us on the outside of their inner circle.

20:37.904 --> 20:41.365
Sound about right?

20:41.407 --> 20:43.409
It does. It really does.

20:43.450 --> 20:45.912
You get me. You always have.

20:45.953 --> 20:49.832
And you don't see how it's shit just like this

20:49.874 --> 20:52.501
that put us on the outside in the first place?

20:55.922 --> 20:57.381
Go wake up Ava,

20:57.423 --> 20:59.592
get her to do your cyber-sleuthing right now.

20:59.633 --> 21:02.428
Don't take no for an answer.

21:02.469 --> 21:05.056
You really think that's okay?

21:05.098 --> 21:08.226
Actually, love of my life, I think it's fucked up,

21:08.267 --> 21:11.229
just not enough to lose sleep over.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.442
Good night, handsome.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.406
This is like a waking nightmare.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.117
I know the timing's a little bit wonky

21:24.158 --> 21:25.618
since it's only been a few hours

21:25.659 --> 21:27.620
since you reiterated your self-righteous disapproval.

21:27.661 --> 21:29.622
Okay, if you're gonna keep making me sound like a dick,

21:29.663 --> 21:30.957
I'm not gonna help you fix this abomination.

21:30.998 --> 21:32.332
I'm sorry. There's a lot of judgment

21:32.374 --> 21:33.793
coming out of that mouth hole these days.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.377
Oh, you're getting a lot of judgment right now?

21:35.419 --> 21:36.503
It's 3:00 in the morning, and you woke me out of bed

21:36.545 --> 21:38.089
to fix your Photoshop mistakes.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.548
I -- I know we've been joking about it, but it's really

21:39.590 --> 21:40.925
starting to piss me off, okay

21:40.967 --> 21:43.010
There's a lot of people I could've called up.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.845
Oh, yeah? You got other friends that you can call

21:43.052 --> 21:44.845
in this sort of situation?

21:44.887 --> 21:46.139
Well, get the phone book out. -I --

21:46.180 --> 21:47.890
-Well, there's --

21:47.932 --> 21:49.142
Where's the phone book with all the people you can call

21:49.183 --> 21:52.394
that can do this? Call them.

21:52.436 --> 21:54.521
There. You

21:54.563 --> 21:58.151
Okay, Jack meant to say thank you.

21:58.192 --> 21:59.485
Thank you.

21:59.526 --> 22:00.861
I do appreciate it. I'm sorry.

22:00.903 --> 22:02.029
I do appreciate you coming over here.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.781
And this is your area of expertise,

22:03.823 --> 22:05.992
and we just need to clean up this mess.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.409
Oh, you're thinking a little Photoshop's

22:07.451 --> 22:08.869
gonna clean up this mess

22:08.911 --> 22:10.913
You need an entire industrial-strength vat

22:10.955 --> 22:13.749
of Purell, just dump it down the street.

22:13.791 --> 22:15.084
Maybe that'll clean it up. No offense

22:15.126 --> 22:16.627
if it sounds like I'm judging you,

22:16.669 --> 22:18.254
but I'm just saying.

22:18.296 --> 22:20.840
This whole thing is a mess. Talk about a mess.

22:20.881 --> 22:23.050
I'd like to never hear about this mess ever again.

22:23.092 --> 22:24.551
That'd be nice.

22:24.593 --> 22:25.803
Just like to have everybody just move on.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.138
And it's the last I want to hear

22:27.180 --> 22:28.764
about this mess of yours, all right?

22:28.806 --> 22:30.516
We're moving on. You included.

22:30.557 --> 22:32.810
Absolutely. No doubt.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.394
Oh, geez. It's like I --

22:34.436 --> 22:36.022
I'm seeing it again for the first time.

22:36.063 --> 22:38.316
-Yeah, that's a problem. -It's like a runaway Smurf.

22:38.356 --> 22:39.399
-Oh, my God. -It's like --

22:39.441 --> 22:40.693
And look at the background, too.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.278
I could've drawn something better.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.904
Yeah, with just pen -- with ink.

22:43.946 --> 22:46.032
I mean, it looks like the weirdest memorial ever.

22:46.073 --> 22:47.783
God, this is like a nightmare. It's like --

22:47.825 --> 22:49.702
it's like an art class gone wrong.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.620
Like, the edges are jagged.

22:51.662 --> 22:53.371
No one is ever gonna buy this. It's --

22:53.413 --> 22:55.291
-I don't know.

22:55.333 --> 22:57.043
It looks like Satan's Christmas card.

22:57.084 --> 22:59.461
Ha-ha. Very funny.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.130
You assholes.

23:01.172 --> 23:03.716
If you would have just been a little nicer to my mother,

23:03.757 --> 23:05.718
we wouldn't even be here right now.

23:05.759 --> 23:08.428
You are the Avas of this neighborhood.

23:10.764 --> 23:11.932
Yeah.

23:11.974 --> 23:13.226
We love your mother, by the way.

23:13.267 --> 23:14.601
-We love your mom. -We're sorry.

23:14.643 --> 23:15.686
We didn't -- -Yeah, we --

23:15.728 --> 23:17.146
You got to start somewhere.

23:17.188 --> 23:19.023
We like you and your mother and your artwork.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.607
You did great on the social-media stuff.

23:20.649 --> 23:21.901
-Yeah, that stuff -- -You did a really good job.

23:21.942 --> 23:23.194
I love the jean jacket.

23:23.236 --> 23:24.528
No one -- You don't see that anymore.

23:24.570 --> 23:25.946
Art school for --

23:25.988 --> 23:27.365
It's like they're in front of the Taj Mahal.

23:27.405 --> 23:28.741
That's fun. -That would be a good idea.

If you need a reference...

23:31.618 --> 23:33.079
Yeah.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.622
You can all just stop blowing me, people.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.457
You know, I was just trying...

23:40.669 --> 23:41.754
Shit.

23:41.795 --> 23:43.256
What does shit mean

23:43.297 --> 23:45.966
Shit. Lori just texted me.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.425
She knows you're gone?

23:47.467 --> 23:49.553
<i>Et voilà.</i>

23:49.595 --> 23:51.222
-Wow. -Aw.

23:51.264 --> 23:54.600
-Oh, my God, that's great. -You really are an artist.

23:54.641 --> 23:56.476
The word is literally in my job description.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.396
Oh, artist, thank you, Dave.

23:58.436 --> 23:59.855
Dave, you're so wonderful.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.481
-Yours was good, too. -Look. I am going to say

24:01.523 --> 24:03.567
that I was just on the front porch

24:03.609 --> 24:04.944
getting the information she wanted,

24:04.985 --> 24:06.779
right? -Yeah.

24:08.822 --> 24:11.742
Lori is on the front porch texting, I believe.

24:11.784 --> 24:12.826
Oh, my God.

24:14.745 --> 24:16.247
Okay, she is the last person

24:16.289 --> 24:18.416
that can be seen leaving our house at 3:00 a.m.

24:18.456 --> 24:20.458
Tell me about it. The polygamy house.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.711
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

24:22.753 --> 24:23.879
-Come on, it's a long night. -All right.

24:23.921 --> 24:25.172
All right. I got it.

24:25.214 --> 24:27.133
Emma, we need a half-empty bottle

24:27.174 --> 24:28.759
of wine, stat. -I can do that.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.803
Good. I'll have a shot of tequila.

24:30.844 --> 24:32.805
Uh, no, you won't.

24:32.846 --> 24:35.182
-This isn't a party. -Okay.

24:35.224 --> 24:36.434
This is how it's gonna go.

24:36.474 --> 24:38.560
Dave and I had a fight. -Yeah.

24:38.602 --> 24:41.230
Emma and I were talking, but she passed out.

24:41.272 --> 24:42.315
So I'm an asshole.

24:42.356 --> 24:44.650
And I'm a drunk. Go -- Go on.

24:44.691 --> 24:47.569
And I go out, spot Lori, and decide to confide in her,

24:47.611 --> 24:50.614
invite her, finally, into the inner sanctum.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.908
-That's actually brilliant. -Yeah.

24:52.950 --> 24:55.077
Where was I when I wasn't in my room?

24:55.119 --> 24:56.536
Studying?

24:56.578 --> 24:59.332
Hooking up with some teenaged dude.

24:59.373 --> 25:01.959
Under the shirt, over the bra.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.877
Yeah.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.171
It's a good idea.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.797
It's a great idea, and I love you.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.967
Love you too. Mm.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.177
-Go get her. -I don't want to go now.

25:11.218 --> 25:13.637
Okay, hold this. -Okay.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.513
Careful, you know, breast milk. Remember that.

25:15.555 --> 25:16.932
Right? -It's an hour to go through.

25:16.974 --> 25:18.725

Ava, go out the back door, okay,
