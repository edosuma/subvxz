00:00.578 --> 00:02.394
<i>Previously on
"Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

00:02.573 --> 00:03.895
Is this your new girlfriend?

00:03.896 --> 00:05.180
- Um, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

00:05.192 --> 00:06.793
You and I dating would
be totally weird.

00:06.794 --> 00:07.500
Totally weird.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.558
Wow, that's beautiful.

00:11.090 --> 00:13.080
Step away from the creature,
miss.

00:13.090 --> 00:16.090
You murdered him!

00:19.250 --> 00:21.420
Hank is running
some secret project.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.260
He's not just taking
the fugitives.

00:23.270 --> 00:24.510
He's testing on them.

00:24.590 --> 00:25.930
I don't need you anymore.

00:25.940 --> 00:27.850
I don't need you anymore,
either.

00:30.890 --> 00:31.820
What did you do?

00:31.900 --> 00:32.850
I'm sorry.

00:44.490 --> 00:46.410
Maybe I shouldn't intrude.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.790
Nate needs all of our
support right now.

00:48.870 --> 00:50.540
Well, what am I supposed
to say to him?

00:50.610 --> 00:52.460
"Sorry the woman I've been
exchanging love letters with

00:52.540 --> 00:54.210
in prison killed your dad"?

00:54.280 --> 00:56.130
They ought to put that
on a condolence card.

00:56.210 --> 00:59.710
Look, we are going inside
and we are going to strive

00:59.790 --> 01:03.010
with grace to help our friend
cope with his loss.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.720
<i>Damn it.</i>

01:04.790 --> 01:06.520
Here, let me help.

01:09.130 --> 01:13.140
Hey, uh, thanks for
sticking around this past week.

01:13.150 --> 01:15.440
What are pretend
girlfriends for?

01:15.510 --> 01:19.070
My mom's gonna be so crushed
when I tell her we broke up.

01:19.140 --> 01:22.490
Then don't.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.280
I... I mean,
she's going through a lot.

01:24.360 --> 01:26.780
We can pretend break up
any time we want.

01:32.840 --> 01:37.330
We should, um... we should
probably get out there.

01:37.340 --> 01:39.180
You ready for this?

01:43.710 --> 01:45.020
Oh, Nathaniel.

01:45.090 --> 01:46.760
I need you to make
a toast later.

01:46.840 --> 01:51.180
Tell everyone what
an amazing man your father was.

01:51.190 --> 01:53.180
Yeah, Mom, I don't think
that's a great idea.

01:53.190 --> 01:55.060
What?
Of course it is.

01:55.140 --> 01:57.150
And Zari, I am so glad
that you're here

01:57.220 --> 01:59.570
for Nathaniel
to lean on right now.

01:59.650 --> 02:01.440
Yeah, um, you know me.

02:01.520 --> 02:04.530
I'm... I'm his rock.

02:04.600 --> 02:07.030
I can't.
I... I can't face him.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.910
Wait... wait.

02:17.460 --> 02:19.630
I hope you're not
stress-eating, squire.

02:21.090 --> 02:22.420
I don't know what else to do.

02:22.500 --> 02:23.800
I can't believe this
is happening.

02:25.890 --> 02:28.090
You feel the energy
in this room?

02:28.170 --> 02:30.730
It's like sitting on
a keg of dynamite.

02:30.810 --> 02:32.390
You see, wakes are
notorious soft spots

02:32.400 --> 02:34.310
where the supernatural
meets the living world.

02:34.380 --> 02:36.020
See Nate's aunt?

02:36.090 --> 02:38.560
That particular prayer
is to ward off evil spirits

02:38.570 --> 02:43.980
and they've covered the mirrors,
so the bad lads can't get in.

02:44.060 --> 02:45.400
Well, that's creepy.

02:45.410 --> 02:47.820
Yeah, well,
creepy is my business.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.420
And it looks like
business is good.

03:01.950 --> 03:03.590
Oh!

03:03.600 --> 03:06.550
Nate, Nate, I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm so sorry.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.010
No, it's... it's okay, Ray.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.010
No, no, no, it's not.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.940
I keep giving Nora
second chances and

03:12.010 --> 03:14.310
she goes and does this.

03:14.380 --> 03:16.680
Look, you thought
Nora could change

03:16.760 --> 03:20.900
and I never thought my dad would
be torturing magical creatures,

03:20.970 --> 03:24.120
so I guess... I guess
we're both wrong.

03:25.690 --> 03:27.690
Can't believe you're
the one comforting me.

03:27.770 --> 03:29.900
Oh, come on.
I love you, bro.

03:29.980 --> 03:31.280
That's never gonna change.

03:33.610 --> 03:34.790
Love you, too.

03:45.620 --> 03:47.920
Oh, no.
Don't, no-no-no, don't.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.470
Don't, don't, don't do it, Ray.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.590
Don't... you're gonna do it.

03:51.670 --> 03:53.310
You're gonna do it.

03:57.110 --> 03:58.100
Nora?

03:58.841 --> 04:03.680

04:04.350 --> 04:05.770
How... how are you doing that?

04:05.850 --> 04:07.320
<i>It's a reflection spell.</i>

04:07.330 --> 04:09.240
<i>I can't hold it much longer.</i>

04:09.310 --> 04:10.790
Well, good, because there's
nothing you could

04:10.860 --> 04:12.320
possibly say that would
make any difference.

04:12.330 --> 04:14.450
This time there will be
no more second chances.

04:14.530 --> 04:16.490
Ray!
I didn't kill Nate's dad.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.620
Oh, thank God, you're innocent.

04:18.700 --> 04:19.790
Tell me where you are.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.910
I need to talk to you in person.

04:28.710 --> 04:32.470
Now, who wants
a nice, juicy steak?

04:34.710 --> 04:38.020
Charlie, uh, you know that
I'm a vegetarian.

04:38.100 --> 04:41.140
No, no, no, you used
to be a vegetarian

04:41.220 --> 04:43.700
when you were
a normal, boring human.

04:43.770 --> 04:45.770
But now you are...
A monster?

04:45.850 --> 04:47.770
Exactly.
I mean, how cool is that?

04:47.850 --> 04:51.030
Wait, are you trying to get
me to shift into Wolfie?

04:51.040 --> 04:52.200
Of course I am.

04:52.280 --> 04:53.320
You've been moping
about the ship,

04:53.400 --> 04:54.860
thinking about your lost love.

04:54.940 --> 04:57.120
But I think that he would
really want you to just

04:57.130 --> 05:00.040
embrace your wild side.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.830
Konane liked me as Mona.

05:02.840 --> 05:03.920
Whoa.

05:05.370 --> 05:06.710
The words on your shirt.

05:06.790 --> 05:07.790
These are the names
of my favorite

05:07.870 --> 05:09.300
Jane Austen characters.

05:09.370 --> 05:11.380
<i>It appears that you're
experiencing</i>

05:11.390 --> 05:13.340
<i>the impact of
a magical fugitive.</i>

05:13.420 --> 05:15.680
Oh.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.900
This better be good, Mona.

05:17.970 --> 05:19.850
A fugitive got to Jane Austen.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.810
She never wrote
"Sense and Sensibility."

05:21.880 --> 05:24.740
And "Pride and Prejudice"
disappeared, too.

05:24.810 --> 05:26.350
Whatever it is,
it's gonna have to wait.

05:26.430 --> 05:28.690
Did someone say
history's in trouble?

05:28.770 --> 05:30.730
Legends assemble!

05:30.810 --> 05:33.190
Okay, I really need to get
out of here, too.

05:33.270 --> 05:34.950
Hey, what's up?

05:34.960 --> 05:36.410
Nothing.

05:36.480 --> 05:39.490
Uh, there's a fugitive alert,
but it can wait.

05:39.570 --> 05:40.910
No, you should go.

05:40.920 --> 05:42.370
It's hard enough I have
to play pretend.

05:42.450 --> 05:44.660
You guys shouldn't.

05:44.740 --> 05:45.920
Okay.

05:52.670 --> 05:54.720
- Bye, Nate.
- Bye, Zari.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.350
Gideon traced a new Fugitive
to a wedding

06:08.430 --> 06:11.450
Jane Austen attended
in Bath, England, 1802.

06:11.530 --> 06:13.530
I already had Gideon
chart a course.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.790
Can I come on the mission?

06:15.860 --> 06:17.910
Please?

06:17.980 --> 06:19.660
Sure.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.910
Yeah, and as much as I love
a good wedding sneak,

06:21.990 --> 06:25.750
I'm gonna QB from, um...
From my bedroom.

06:27.950 --> 06:29.960
Is he acting weirder
than normal?

06:29.970 --> 06:31.130
Yeah.

06:32.710 --> 06:34.550
Speaking of weird...

06:34.560 --> 06:37.590
I think my sense of smell
has improved because of Wolfie.

06:37.670 --> 06:41.980
And you smell exactly like...
Nate.

06:43.730 --> 06:44.980
No, I don't.

06:45.060 --> 06:46.980
It's definitely Nate.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.150
Nate and something else.

06:48.230 --> 06:50.810
Arousal?

06:52.230 --> 06:53.770
No, I don't...
I don't like Nate.

06:53.850 --> 06:57.030
That would be wrong and...
He likes you.

06:57.100 --> 06:59.160
He confessed it when he
swallowed the truth bug.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.410
We're so not passing
the Bechdel Test right now.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.410
It's okay to talk
about guys sometimes.

07:03.490 --> 07:04.790
Come on.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.080
I bet it's been months
since you got laid.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.170
Now, why don't you just
go smash Nate?

07:08.250 --> 07:10.080
Or better yet, you should go

07:10.160 --> 07:11.670
smash somebody else because
if you're still thinking

07:11.680 --> 07:13.920
about Nate then you know
you're really into him.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.020
Why don't you talk to Nate?
Tell him how you feel.

07:17.090 --> 07:19.680
- Oh, boo.
- That is a terrible idea.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.510
Okay, I'm going.
Bye.

07:27.530 --> 07:31.100
This is like a Jane Austen
novel come to life.

07:35.230 --> 07:37.110
Oh, my bonnet!

07:37.190 --> 07:38.400
Look out!

07:38.480 --> 07:41.110
Whoa!

07:41.120 --> 07:42.870
- Whoa.
- Oh.

07:48.910 --> 07:51.380
Forgive me, miss.
Are you hurt?

07:54.220 --> 07:56.800
Only my pride.

07:56.870 --> 08:01.560
Injured pride
is a small thing...

08:01.640 --> 08:05.220
if it allowed us to meet.

08:05.300 --> 08:07.140
What's the holdup there?

08:07.220 --> 08:10.030
Come, come, I say.
Duty calls.

08:15.180 --> 08:17.070
Apologies, Lord Remington.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.580
We'll be on our way shortly.

08:18.650 --> 08:20.190
Here.

08:20.270 --> 08:22.750
Not a word.

08:22.820 --> 08:24.250
Was that a curtsey?

08:24.330 --> 08:26.200
"Only my pride."

08:26.280 --> 08:27.990
Okay, let's go.
Shut up.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.660
A damsel.

08:41.429 --> 08:45.430
If you don't jump that
buff coachman's bones, I will.

08:45.500 --> 08:50.020
We are at this wedding
to catch a magical creature.

08:50.090 --> 08:54.350
If that's the groom,
then I'm glad I'm not the bride.

08:54.430 --> 08:57.410
A man's charms
are equal to his fortunes.

08:57.480 --> 09:00.620
And Mr. Dockerty's fortunes
are prodigious.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.280
Jane.

09:02.290 --> 09:05.370
Don't be rude.

09:06.940 --> 09:10.800
That's Jane Austen.

09:21.810 --> 09:23.920
I cannot marry you,
Mr. Dockerty.

09:26.130 --> 09:28.390
My heart yearns for another.

09:28.460 --> 09:30.480
Our family's scullery maid.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.350
Ellen, are you here?

09:33.360 --> 09:35.020
I'm here.

09:35.030 --> 09:36.980
I love you, too!

09:36.990 --> 09:39.770
Scandal!

09:39.850 --> 09:41.610
Oh, dear Lord.

09:41.690 --> 09:43.150
Oh.

09:43.230 --> 09:45.400
I give not one fig,
Miss Sinclair,

09:45.480 --> 09:49.830
for my heart and
my lower extremities yearn

09:49.910 --> 09:51.670
for your mother.

09:51.750 --> 09:54.960
Get over here, gorgeous.

09:57.910 --> 10:01.260
- Come to me, my love.
- Ooh!

10:09.300 --> 10:10.940
This is what I call a wedding.

10:14.569 --> 10:15.989
Coast is clear.

10:18.189 --> 10:20.329
I really don't want you to get
in trouble with your friends.

10:20.409 --> 10:21.839
Oh, it's no trouble.

10:21.909 --> 10:23.159
It looks like everyone else
is still on mission.

10:23.169 --> 10:24.659
Okay.

10:24.669 --> 10:26.869
Uh, so, who did kill Hank?

10:26.879 --> 10:29.209
- The demon.
- Okay, good.

10:29.289 --> 10:31.249
I... obviously, I mean...
Obviously, it's bad.

10:31.329 --> 10:33.089
If it's a demon, that means that

10:33.099 --> 10:34.509
John will be able to find
proof and

10:34.519 --> 10:36.589
you just need to lay low
until he comes back.

10:36.669 --> 10:38.429
You really don't mind
me staying here?

10:38.499 --> 10:41.509
Yeah, no, it'd be nice
if you stayed here.

10:41.519 --> 10:43.809
Oy, Rayge.
Where are you?

10:43.879 --> 10:46.429
I've got an update
on the mission...

10:46.449 --> 10:48.439
- "Rayge"?
- It's a long story.

10:48.509 --> 10:50.309
- ...need to do some research...
- What's... oh... oh...

10:51.939 --> 10:54.029
What...

10:54.109 --> 10:55.529
What are you hiding in there?

10:55.539 --> 10:56.949
Hmm? What?
Nothing.

10:57.029 --> 10:59.819
Ah, buffing the old bishop,
was we?

10:59.899 --> 11:01.869
It's all right, mate.

11:01.879 --> 11:03.949
No judgment here, all right?

11:04.029 --> 11:06.249
Come on.
Oh, yeah.

11:06.319 --> 11:08.789
So, the bride
and the scullery maid,

11:08.869 --> 11:10.379
that was...
Insane?

11:10.389 --> 11:12.879
- Romantic.
- I was gonna say hot.

11:12.889 --> 11:14.549
Regardless, that definitely
did not happen

11:14.559 --> 11:16.129
in actual history.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.729
Ray, Charlie, what you got?

11:18.799 --> 11:20.839
This wedding was
the second of a series

11:20.919 --> 11:23.179
of lust outbreaks in 1802.

11:23.259 --> 11:24.729
Yeah, the sexual revolution came

11:24.809 --> 11:26.609
a couple hundred years
too early.

11:26.679 --> 11:29.739
Why would it make
Jane Austen stop writing?

11:29.809 --> 11:31.239
We need more info.

11:31.309 --> 11:33.149
Well, Jane Austen
was known for being

11:33.219 --> 11:36.069
a keen social observer,
so if anyone would have noticed

11:36.079 --> 11:39.069
a new magical arrival in town,
it would be her.

11:39.079 --> 11:41.749
Okay, let's go interview Jane.

11:41.829 --> 11:43.379
<i>Oh, wait, hang on a tick.</i>

11:43.449 --> 11:46.989
People with the real dirt,
always the servants.

11:47.069 --> 11:51.499
Like a handsome
coachman perhaps, hmm?

11:51.579 --> 11:54.089
Fine, I'll go
ask him some questions.

11:54.099 --> 11:56.249
But that's it.
You go get it, girl.

11:56.259 --> 11:57.879
Okay.

12:03.439 --> 12:07.389
Sister, dear,
this is Miss Lance and Miss Wu.

12:07.469 --> 12:09.279
They're new in town.

12:09.349 --> 12:10.939
Try not to scare them away.

12:10.949 --> 12:12.849
I shall do my best, Cassandra.

12:18.569 --> 12:22.859
We are so sorry to interrupt
your writing, Miss Austen.

12:22.939 --> 12:24.819
This?
Just a letter.

12:24.839 --> 12:27.159
Uh, shall we take a turn around
the room while we converse?

12:27.239 --> 12:28.739
We'd be delighted to.

12:28.819 --> 12:31.209
It's a Regency thing.
Go with it.

12:38.159 --> 12:41.309
So, the bride, Miss Sinclair,

12:41.379 --> 12:43.809
her behavior must have been
quite a shock.

12:43.889 --> 12:46.099
Ever since Lord Remington
arrived a week ago,

12:46.169 --> 12:49.319
the entire town has been
acting most imprudently.

12:49.389 --> 12:54.229
But Miss Sinclair's situation
is truly horrendous.

12:54.309 --> 12:56.399
Oh, I'd think you of all people

12:56.469 --> 12:58.979
would celebrate
the triumph of romance.

12:58.989 --> 13:00.609
What's to celebrate?

13:00.689 --> 13:02.569
Miss Sinclair will be
cut off from her fortune

13:02.649 --> 13:04.319
and the two women
will have nothing to live on.

13:04.329 --> 13:07.529
But it's because of you...
I... I mean...

13:07.609 --> 13:10.079
I have come to believe that

13:10.149 --> 13:13.669
love will find a way
to overcome any obstacle.

13:13.749 --> 13:16.919
Then you're either
lying or you're a fool.

13:16.989 --> 13:19.419
Tell me, has love worked out
so well for you?

13:19.499 --> 13:21.759
- No, but...
- Then you are a fool.

13:21.829 --> 13:25.799
For you shouldn't have
to learn a lesson twice.

13:29.769 --> 13:33.529
Let's go find Lord Remington.

13:33.599 --> 13:35.489
We should be going.

13:36.889 --> 13:39.689
Hello?

13:39.699 --> 13:41.739
This is stupid.

13:48.399 --> 13:51.709
What a pleasure
to see you again.

14:00.459 --> 14:03.299
Hey, man.

14:03.309 --> 14:05.419
What's up, pretty?

14:05.439 --> 14:08.339
This whole toasting is
eating me up on the inside.

14:08.419 --> 14:10.889
My... my dad was such a dick.

14:10.899 --> 14:12.229
He lied about everything and now

14:12.309 --> 14:14.309
he's turning me
into a liar, too.

14:14.319 --> 14:16.139
Listen, your old man's gone.

14:16.219 --> 14:20.729
Whatever you say out there,
that's for you.

14:20.739 --> 14:22.899
You know what, Mick?

14:22.909 --> 14:25.829
I think you're onto something.

14:44.169 --> 14:45.879
<i>Nathaniel!</i>

14:50.129 --> 14:52.429
Hey, where's Nate?

14:52.509 --> 14:55.059
Well, we need to find him
because Hank's spirit

14:55.129 --> 14:56.729
is still here.

14:58.759 --> 15:00.609
Hey, cheer up.

15:00.689 --> 15:02.359
I mean,
what does Jane Austen know?

15:02.429 --> 15:04.939
How to be witty and wise
and mix satire with romance.

15:06.619 --> 15:09.239
I bet you these girls know
where Lord Remington is.

15:09.319 --> 15:11.279
They do look like fan girls.

15:11.289 --> 15:14.039
Okay, you know the era.
You take the lead.

15:14.109 --> 15:17.959
He's simply the handsomest
man I've ever laid eyes on.

15:20.799 --> 15:22.249
I know what you mean.

15:22.329 --> 15:25.669
Lord Remington is such
a fine specimen.

15:25.749 --> 15:28.809
I can't say I share
your sentiment.

15:34.129 --> 15:36.769
His coachman, though,
what he lacks in means,

15:36.839 --> 15:38.429
he makes up for in magnetism.

15:38.509 --> 15:39.989
I concur.

15:40.059 --> 15:42.659
His arrival has sent
many hearts aflutter.

15:44.979 --> 15:46.329
Coachman,

15:46.399 --> 15:48.489
as in the guy
we pushed Zari to hook up with!

15:48.499 --> 15:51.109
Zari's gonna smash the fugitive!

15:51.189 --> 15:52.419
Oh...

15:56.499 --> 15:58.999
Sorry.
This is moving really fast.

15:59.009 --> 16:02.749
- I agree.
- You do?

16:02.829 --> 16:03.999
What's your name?

16:05.749 --> 16:09.089
Uh, my name is Zari.
What's your name?

16:09.169 --> 16:10.629
You know what?
Don't... don't answer that.

16:10.639 --> 16:14.849
You don't kiss like
any man I've ever known.

16:14.929 --> 16:18.309
What are you?

16:23.029 --> 16:25.029
I am Kamadeva,

16:25.109 --> 16:29.869
the Hindu god of love.

16:29.949 --> 16:31.739
Awesome.

16:36.934 --> 16:38.452
- Oh!
- We're too late!

16:41.066 --> 16:42.286
Zari!

16:42.356 --> 16:44.026
We think you might
be dealing with...

16:44.106 --> 16:46.366
The fugitive?

16:46.436 --> 16:48.036
Yeah, I know.

16:48.106 --> 16:50.496
This is Kamadeva.

16:50.566 --> 16:55.326
As in the namesake
of Kama Sutra, Kamadeva?

16:55.406 --> 16:56.886
That I did not know.

16:56.956 --> 17:01.546
Look, I'm not going to
sleep with a magical fugitive.

17:01.556 --> 17:03.796
You are incredible.

17:03.876 --> 17:06.715
A woman has never before
resisted my charms.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.346
All right,
you're coming with us.

17:08.356 --> 17:11.056
I would follow Miss Zari
to the world's end.

17:21.435 --> 17:24.906
Well, your days of ruining
Regency-era marriages

17:24.915 --> 17:26.695
are over, Kamadeva.

17:26.776 --> 17:29.026
I only sought to grant people
the courage

17:29.106 --> 17:31.196
to follow their hearts' desire.

17:31.276 --> 17:33.206
Oh, I think he likes you.

17:33.276 --> 17:34.706
Gideon, get us out of here.

17:34.776 --> 17:37.256
I'm not so sure we can go yet.

17:39.836 --> 17:41.376
<i>Miss Wu is correct.</i>

17:41.456 --> 17:43.046
<i>The historical records
still indicate</i>

17:43.056 --> 17:44.756
<i>that Jane Austen's
career is in jeopardy.</i>

17:44.766 --> 17:46.676
We caught the fugitive.
What's the problem?

17:46.746 --> 17:48.796
Well, it's too late to knock
on Jane Austen's door tonight.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.216
We'll talk to her tomorrow.

17:50.296 --> 17:53.276
So, I'm to spend the night...

17:53.346 --> 17:56.106
Alone.

17:56.186 --> 17:58.186
Oh, what a waste.

17:58.266 --> 17:59.856
All right, everybody out.

17:59.926 --> 18:01.606
- Hi.
- Come on.

18:01.616 --> 18:03.606
Surely I can have a bed.

18:10.236 --> 18:13.406
Well, I had Gideon fabricate
some jim-jams because, uh,

18:13.486 --> 18:14.996
you know, it's a slumber party.

18:15.006 --> 18:17.256
Oh, uh, thanks.

18:20.876 --> 18:24.706
Uh, obviously since you're
my guest, you will get the bed.

18:24.786 --> 18:27.126
Oh, well, it's big enough
for the both of us.

18:27.136 --> 18:28.386
We can just share.

18:28.456 --> 18:30.216
Oh, okay.

18:30.296 --> 18:34.386
You can turn around now.

18:34.466 --> 18:35.886
Hmm.

18:35.966 --> 18:37.636
It really covers everything.

18:52.166 --> 18:54.326
Thing is, I pride myself
on being a gentleman

18:54.396 --> 18:57.836
and the gentlemanly thing to do
would be to sleep in the chair.

18:57.916 --> 18:59.836
So...

19:02.576 --> 19:05.796
But you... you...
You can't... there's no way...

19:05.866 --> 19:08.676
Oh, that's not...

19:11.216 --> 19:13.256
Okay.

19:17.716 --> 19:21.186
Hey, Nate.
How's the old toast going?

19:21.196 --> 19:23.526
Is there one or two N's
in "conniving"?

19:23.606 --> 19:25.106
Right, then.

19:25.186 --> 19:27.986
Uh, may I suggest
a slight change of plan?

19:28.056 --> 19:29.486
No.
Mick is right.

19:29.556 --> 19:33.706
It's time for me to tell
the truth about my dad.

19:33.786 --> 19:36.036
How was I supposed to know
Hank's ghost was here?

19:37.956 --> 19:39.546
Wait, what?

19:39.626 --> 19:41.456
Yeah, that's about
the gist of it, Natey boy.

19:41.526 --> 19:43.836
You see, your old man's spirit
is working very hard

19:43.906 --> 19:45.836
to stay attached
to the mortal realm.

19:45.906 --> 19:47.546
I can only surmise
that he has something

19:47.556 --> 19:48.916
he wants to say to you,
so if you wouldn't mind

19:48.926 --> 19:50.716
leaving off your roast
for a bit,

19:50.786 --> 19:52.216
joining us for a brief séance,

19:52.226 --> 19:55.396
and I'll have him
on his way in no time.

19:55.466 --> 19:56.886
No.

19:56.966 --> 19:59.566
There's nothing Hank
can say now to excuse him

19:59.646 --> 20:01.846
from embezzling money
and hurting creatures.

20:01.926 --> 20:04.056
In fact, I'm glad
he's still here,

20:04.066 --> 20:06.186
'cause it's his turn
to listen to me!

20:13.436 --> 20:15.236
You don't scare me, Hank!

20:54.876 --> 20:56.316
Ray?

20:58.956 --> 21:01.156
You want me in bed with you?

21:01.236 --> 21:03.626
Yes, I did.
I do.

21:03.706 --> 21:05.126
I do.

21:14.246 --> 21:16.796
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

21:24.796 --> 21:26.596
Ava.

22:04.856 --> 22:06.946
Damn it,
this is definitely a dream.

22:12.686 --> 22:14.816
The fugitive get to you, too?

22:14.896 --> 22:16.446
Yeah.

22:16.456 --> 22:18.026
Well, personally,
I really enjoyed my night,

22:18.036 --> 22:19.986
blowing David Bowie's mind.

22:21.156 --> 22:22.366
Who'd you get a leg over, Z?

22:22.376 --> 22:23.826
Wait, let me guess.
Nate?

22:23.906 --> 22:26.496
No, Kamadeva.

22:26.566 --> 22:28.746
- Both?
- It was both!

22:28.756 --> 22:31.036
Blimey, Z, I didn't know
you had it in you.

22:31.056 --> 22:33.416
What about you, Wolfie?

22:33.496 --> 22:36.476
You dreamt about Konane.

22:38.746 --> 22:40.396
Mona...

22:40.466 --> 22:42.896
I'll get it.

22:47.236 --> 22:51.226
Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay.

22:51.236 --> 22:53.236
He had the sweetest eyes.

22:53.316 --> 22:55.566
And when he would look at me,

22:55.576 --> 22:57.736
the whole world would disappear.

22:57.746 --> 23:01.526
And now he's dead.

23:01.606 --> 23:05.536
Mona, I know it's hard, but
try to have some perspective.

23:05.606 --> 23:07.286
You didn't know him
for very long.

23:07.366 --> 23:09.456
So, you think I'm a fool, too?

23:09.526 --> 23:11.916
No, I just don't think anyone
should give their heart away

23:11.926 --> 23:13.706
without thinking about
the consequences.

23:13.786 --> 23:16.756
But romance is taking
a chance on someone

23:16.766 --> 23:18.876
without knowing how
it's gonna end up!

23:18.956 --> 23:20.926
Romance is something used
to sell novels.

23:20.936 --> 23:22.176
It's not real.

23:22.256 --> 23:24.596
Well, it'll never
be real for you.

23:24.666 --> 23:26.516
Not if you never try.

23:26.586 --> 23:28.596
Not if you never take a risk!

23:28.606 --> 23:30.226
You know, it's hard to take
advice from someone

23:30.306 --> 23:32.226
whose boyfriend turned her
into a werewolf.

23:32.306 --> 23:34.226
Hey, guys.

23:34.306 --> 23:36.856
Let's just take a breath.

23:36.936 --> 23:38.446
You're right.

23:38.456 --> 23:42.156
I might be stupid
for being a romantic,

23:42.226 --> 23:45.956
but it's not Konane's fault.

23:54.836 --> 23:57.586
Bloody hell!

23:57.666 --> 23:59.546
Finally!
You look wicked, mate!

24:04.666 --> 24:06.306
Mona, wait!

24:11.096 --> 24:12.266
Jane Austen.

24:13.636 --> 24:15.316
It's time for you to pay!

24:18.216 --> 24:19.806
Stay back, beast!

24:19.886 --> 24:22.436
If I'm a beast,
it's because of you!

24:22.506 --> 24:24.816
Your books made me
an incurable romantic!

24:24.886 --> 24:27.896
You're the reason I risked
everything for love!

24:29.186 --> 24:32.906
And now Konane's dead!

24:32.976 --> 24:34.406
And look at me!

24:36.646 --> 24:38.156
You don't believe in romance!

24:38.236 --> 24:41.216
Your writing is all lies!

24:46.056 --> 24:47.886
Are you the girl from earlier?

24:47.966 --> 24:49.796
Mona is weak.

24:49.876 --> 24:52.376
Wolfie is strong.

24:54.586 --> 24:58.346
Well, Wolfie,
I believe from the depths

24:58.356 --> 25:01.726
of my soul that
one should only marry for love.

25:01.736 --> 25:03.476
You do?

25:03.556 --> 25:05.906
So much so that I rejected
the only man who has ever

25:05.976 --> 25:07.646
asked for my hand.

25:07.726 --> 25:11.406
He was a smug simpleton
who only read sermons.

25:22.696 --> 25:25.216
How remarkable.

25:27.906 --> 25:29.586
You shouldn't mess
with people's dreams.

25:31.176 --> 25:34.546
My powers don't create passion
out of thin air.

25:34.626 --> 25:37.436
Whomever you dreamt about,
you truly desire.

25:37.516 --> 25:38.716
It doesn't mean I have
to act on it.

25:38.726 --> 25:40.266
It's called impulse control.

25:40.276 --> 25:41.926
You sound like a woman

25:41.936 --> 25:44.596
who has never
let herself fall in love.

25:44.606 --> 25:46.766
Where I'm from,
love is a liability.

25:46.776 --> 25:51.866
And yet a life without love
is no life at all.

25:51.946 --> 25:54.746
Tell me, what does a god
know about the human heart?

26:02.036 --> 26:04.366
My real name is Sunjay.

26:04.446 --> 26:06.626
I was born
thousands of years ago.

26:06.636 --> 26:10.136
When the actual Kamadeva
was immolated by Shiva,

26:10.206 --> 26:13.166
I gathered his ashes
in this vial.

26:13.246 --> 26:16.636
They bestowed powers
I could have scarcely imagined.

26:16.646 --> 26:19.556
Why are you telling me this?

26:19.626 --> 26:22.516
Because I like you.

26:22.586 --> 26:27.656
And I think you secretly yearn
to be impulsive and free.

26:29.186 --> 26:32.326
Unless you lack the courage.

26:43.656 --> 26:45.336
Okay.
Give me a hit.

26:45.416 --> 26:47.116
- Might I suggest...
- Nope.

26:47.136 --> 26:49.046
If I'm gonna do this,
I want to experience

26:49.126 --> 26:51.676
love, lust, the whole shebang.

26:51.756 --> 26:55.126
That is,
unless you lack the courage.

27:04.436 --> 27:07.516
One, two, three.

27:11.386 --> 27:12.516
Oh, wow.

27:19.726 --> 27:22.986
Most of you here, uh,
knew Hank well.

27:23.066 --> 27:26.586
Or, thought you did.

27:28.046 --> 27:29.366
I'm gonna talk about
a different Hank,

27:29.386 --> 27:31.496
a Hank I got to know this year.

27:47.736 --> 27:52.476
Hank was a workaholic
who never took a day off.

27:52.556 --> 27:56.566
Well, Hank, you can, um,
finally rest in peace.

28:07.666 --> 28:11.706
Um, Hank never knew
his own father.

28:11.786 --> 28:15.756
That's why he wanted to be
there for Nathaniel growing up.

28:15.836 --> 28:19.376
But work often got in the way.

28:19.456 --> 28:24.256
So one year,
we planned to use Hank's leave

28:24.266 --> 28:28.306
to stay for a week
in Disney World.

28:28.386 --> 28:32.146
Nathaniel was over the moon.

28:32.216 --> 28:35.766
But the morning that
we were to fly to Orlando,

28:35.786 --> 28:39.106
we ended up having
to take Nathaniel

28:39.116 --> 28:41.526
to the hospital instead.

28:41.606 --> 28:44.276
When Hank saw the look
of disappointment

28:44.286 --> 28:47.196
in his son's eyes, he went out

28:47.276 --> 28:50.966
and rented
a Mickey Mouse costume,

28:51.036 --> 28:55.136
put it on,
and went to the hospital.

28:55.206 --> 28:58.306
He convinced everyone there
that Mickey Mouse

28:58.376 --> 29:01.926
had come to see them.

29:01.996 --> 29:04.646
Hank Heywood was
not a perfect man.

29:04.716 --> 29:09.556
But when he was at his best,
that is who he was,

29:09.626 --> 29:13.096
a man who could make you
believe in magic.

29:17.656 --> 29:18.726
To Hank.

29:18.806 --> 29:20.606
To Hank.

29:27.856 --> 29:30.826
Why did you tell me
that by following their hearts,

29:30.836 --> 29:33.956
those women would only
fall into despair?

29:34.026 --> 29:37.676
Because my decision
was a result of my pride.

29:37.756 --> 29:39.956
When my father dies,
my sister and I will be

29:40.036 --> 29:41.176
reduced to penury.

29:41.256 --> 29:42.176
But your writing...

29:42.256 --> 29:43.216
Has been rejected

29:43.286 --> 29:47.136
by every publisher.

29:47.206 --> 29:48.856
It's no wonder.

29:48.926 --> 29:50.926
I satirize the manners
of a society that seems

29:51.006 --> 29:52.686
to have lost all
sense of decorum.

29:52.766 --> 29:55.186
Therefore, I've decided
to stop writing.

29:55.196 --> 29:57.106
But you will publish.

29:57.176 --> 29:58.686
You can't give up now,

29:58.696 --> 30:02.486
because your books are timeless.

30:02.556 --> 30:04.146
How can you be so sure?

30:04.226 --> 30:07.316
Because...

30:07.336 --> 30:11.156
You're my favorite author.

30:14.926 --> 30:18.416
May I offer you a bit of advice?

30:18.496 --> 30:21.886
My books advocate a partnership
based on love

30:21.966 --> 30:24.626
and mutual respect,

30:24.706 --> 30:26.506
not on losing control.

30:33.636 --> 30:35.056
What shall we do next?

30:35.066 --> 30:36.936
I have an idea.

30:37.006 --> 30:39.986
Let's get married.

30:45.891 --> 30:46.891
Do you hear that?

30:46.971 --> 30:49.301
No.
Hear what?

30:49.381 --> 30:51.301
There's definitely
music playing.

30:51.381 --> 30:53.471
Kamadeva loved music.

30:53.551 --> 30:54.681
Perhaps you should sing.

30:54.761 --> 30:56.221
I don't sing.

and a Hindu man?

31:53.821 --> 31:55.741
Let's not think with our heads,

31:55.751 --> 31:58.131
but feel with our hearts.

32:05.241 --> 32:07.421
Gideon, where's
that music coming from?

32:07.501 --> 32:09.011

32:10.791 --> 32:12.131
It's rather infectious.

32:13.961 --> 32:15.801
Ray, this music,

32:15.811 --> 32:17.971
I think it's magical.
You're right.

32:17.981 --> 32:19.971
I want to express my feelings
to you in verse.

32:19.981 --> 32:21.601
Is that really necessary?

32:21.681 --> 32:24.101
I had a dirty dream of you.

32:24.181 --> 32:25.981
I'll bet mine was dirtier.

32:25.991 --> 32:28.071
Why didn't you go
and make a move?

32:28.141 --> 32:30.071
I would have,
if you'd been flirtier.

32:30.141 --> 32:31.111
Okay.

32:31.191 --> 32:32.321
It's just complicated.

32:32.401 --> 32:33.951
If Nate knew, he'd be enraged.

32:34.021 --> 32:35.741
I know, and I'm sorry,

32:35.821 --> 32:39.291
but my desire's been uncaged.

32:39.361 --> 32:41.451
Don't let this moment
pass us by.

32:41.531 --> 32:43.291
It could be our only chance.

32:43.371 --> 32:45.001
You're right.
I need you now.

32:45.081 --> 32:46.961

36:18.695 --> 36:22.685
Hank Heywood, I summon you.

36:22.765 --> 36:25.395
Quos eici!

36:30.105 --> 36:33.235
Hank?

36:33.255 --> 36:34.615
Who else would it be?

36:34.625 --> 36:36.285
Where's Nathaniel?

36:36.365 --> 36:38.465
Oh, well, Nate gave you
the big middle finger,

36:38.535 --> 36:40.375
so I'm afraid you're
stuck with me.

36:40.445 --> 36:42.455
Still angry, is he?

36:42.465 --> 36:44.625
Us Heywoods,
we hold a good grudge.

36:44.635 --> 36:47.305
Now, what's so important
that you had to stick around?

36:49.125 --> 36:52.185
It pains me to admit it,
but I made a terrible mistake.

36:55.225 --> 36:57.475
<i>A man approached me
about a deal.</i>

36:59.235 --> 37:01.355
<i>Unlimited funding.</i>

37:01.425 --> 37:04.395
<i>And all I had to do was give
him access to all the magical</i>

37:04.475 --> 37:06.825
<i>creatures within
the Time Bureau.</i>

37:06.895 --> 37:10.665
<i>But this man was no ordinary
beltway bandit.</i>

37:10.735 --> 37:12.825
He was a demon.

37:20.175 --> 37:24.665
<i>Only after he murdered me
did I realize the truth.</i>

37:24.745 --> 37:26.795
What was the demon's name?

37:26.865 --> 37:28.505
Promise me you'll keep
Nathaniel safe.

37:28.515 --> 37:30.465
Yes, yes, yes, I promise.

37:30.535 --> 37:33.635
Now, come on, Hank, you can't
delay the inevitable forever.

37:33.705 --> 37:35.975
What was the demon's name?

37:36.055 --> 37:39.635
His name was Neron.

38:18.475 --> 38:20.885
<i>Hey, world.
I'm Hank Heywood.</i>

38:20.895 --> 38:24.065
<i>And I'm here to tell you about
an exciting opportunity.</i>

38:24.145 --> 38:25.975
<i>When I learned about
the existence of</i>

38:26.055 --> 38:30.315
<i>magical creatures...
Yes, magical creatures exist...</i>

38:30.395 --> 38:34.575
<i>I ran right home and pulled
out a drawing made by my son,</i>

38:34.655 --> 38:37.865
<i>Nathaniel, when he was only
nine years old.</i>

38:37.945 --> 38:42.075
<i>My son envisioned
a theme park where everyone</i>

38:42.085 --> 38:45.255
<i>could gaze in wonder
at dragons and unicorns,</i>

38:45.335 --> 38:46.995
<i>werewolves and minotaurs.</i>

38:47.075 --> 38:48.835
This is insane.

38:48.905 --> 38:52.295
<i>Now, you may be thinking,
"This is insane."</i>

38:52.375 --> 38:55.005
<i>But what great man hasn't
been thought of as insane</i>

38:55.085 --> 38:56.925
<i>at one point in his life?</i>

38:56.935 --> 39:00.605
<i>I believe this park can bring
our country together.</i>

39:00.685 --> 39:03.265
<i>And with your help,
I'm going to turn my son's</i>

39:03.275 --> 39:05.935
<i>dream into a reality.</i>

39:05.945 --> 39:08.265
<i>I call it Heyworld.</i>

39:12.095 --> 39:14.485
Oh, Hank.

39:14.565 --> 39:16.205
Why?

39:23.815 --> 39:25.615
Oh, Hank.

39:27.495 --> 39:31.335
I have so many questions.

39:31.415 --> 39:33.805
You weren't torturing
magical creatures.

39:33.885 --> 39:36.635
You were training them
to be in a theme park.

39:36.645 --> 39:39.305
That is nuts.

39:41.815 --> 39:44.305
But I gotta respect you
for dreaming big.

39:44.315 --> 39:46.555
It was your moonshot,
your way of

39:46.635 --> 39:50.225
risking it all to make
the world a better place.

39:54.185 --> 39:57.165
I was so wrong about you.

40:00.355 --> 40:02.405
At the end of the day,
you were just as wacky

40:02.485 --> 40:07.415
and well-intentioned
as any legend.

40:07.485 --> 40:11.585
And I wish I had a chance to
get to know that side of you.

40:17.995 --> 40:21.055
I'm gonna miss you.

40:21.135 --> 40:24.265
I love you, Hank.

40:28.175 --> 40:30.735
I love you, Dad.

40:35.725 --> 40:37.525
Look at you.

40:37.535 --> 40:41.825
Take a look at yourself,
you miserable git.

40:41.895 --> 40:45.705
- That's right.
- Soak it in.

40:45.785 --> 40:48.495
Your big sacrifice,
it was for nothing.

40:48.575 --> 40:51.205
But instead of rolling up
your sleeves and taking it

40:51.215 --> 40:53.335
to that demon bastard,

40:53.405 --> 40:57.835
you're getting rat-ass drunk
in a shed.

40:57.915 --> 41:00.385
I can't fight him.

41:00.465 --> 41:01.675
He's too strong.

41:01.755 --> 41:03.885
Oh, this isn't about Neron.

41:03.895 --> 41:05.465
You failed Desmond.

41:05.545 --> 41:06.805
You failed Astra.

41:06.885 --> 41:08.475
And you'll fail Nate.

41:08.545 --> 41:10.565
And you know why?

41:10.645 --> 41:12.645
Because deep down,

41:12.725 --> 41:14.655
you want them all to go to Hell.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.025
You want the company.

41:19.105 --> 41:20.355
You liar!

41:27.065 --> 41:29.755
Hey, Johnny.

41:29.825 --> 41:32.165
Miss me?

41:32.235 --> 41:33.995
Des.

41:34.075 --> 41:37.045
I'm surprised you haven't
figured it out yet.

41:39.745 --> 41:40.935
Neron.

41:41.305 --> 41:47.623
