WEBVTT

00:07.374 --> 00:09.399
When the Captain told us
to start collecting deuterium,

00:09.476 --> 00:11.273
Seven suggested a series
of modifications

00:11.344 --> 00:12.675
to the Bussard collectors.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.737
Problem is, I didn't realize
the extent of the modifications

00:14.814 --> 00:16.543
until after we'd begun
the sweep--

00:16.616 --> 00:18.277
I mean, not that there was
anything wrong with them.

00:18.351 --> 00:19.978
In fact, efficiency
is up 23 percent.

00:20.053 --> 00:21.213
In a nutshell, Harry.

00:21.287 --> 00:23.255
The collectors are almost full,

00:23.323 --> 00:24.620
but I can't tell
exactly how full

00:24.691 --> 00:26.386
until I realign my sensors
with Seven's.

00:26.459 --> 00:29.189
Why didn't you
just say so?

00:29.262 --> 00:31.253
Next time, work closer
with her from the start.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.300
Closer. Right.

00:35.368 --> 00:39.668
So, you're going to realign
your sensors with Seven's.

00:39.739 --> 00:41.764
Sounds like fun.

00:41.841 --> 00:43.536
Very funny.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.774
What was that?

00:46.846 --> 00:49.838
Are you getting feedback
from Seven's modifications?

00:49.916 --> 00:51.850
Negative.

00:51.918 --> 00:53.317
Report.

00:53.386 --> 00:56.617
I am picking up proton surges
just outside the ship.

00:56.689 --> 00:58.418
The first was
off the port beam,

00:58.491 --> 01:00.288
and the second two were
off the starboard bow.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.554
On screen.

01:01.628 --> 01:04.290
There's nothing out there.

01:04.364 --> 01:06.855
Whatever it is,
it's getting closer.

01:06.933 --> 01:09.231
Red Alert.
Janeway to Astrometrics.

01:09.302 --> 01:10.394
Yes, Captain.

01:10.470 --> 01:13.268
Use the astrometric sensors
to scan for the disturbance.

01:15.275 --> 01:17.539
I'm detecting
close-range weapons fire.

01:17.610 --> 01:19.305
Source?

01:19.379 --> 01:24.112
Proton surges suggest two
cloaked ships engaged in battle.

01:24.184 --> 01:25.082
With us caught in the middle.

01:25.151 --> 01:26.448
Evasive maneuvers.

01:26.519 --> 01:27.451
Aye, sir.

01:27.520 --> 01:28.680
There's a massive
power surge--

01:28.755 --> 01:30.848
like one of the
ships is exploding.

01:34.461 --> 01:35.894
Captain,

01:35.962 --> 01:37.554
there is one life sign aboard

01:37.630 --> 01:38.597
that vessel.

01:41.701 --> 01:43.532
It is no longer on our sensors.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.571
We're being hailed--
audio only.

01:45.638 --> 01:46.730
Let's hear it.

01:46.806 --> 01:49.934
Chakotay, please,
I need your help.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:49.362 --> 03:51.990
Chakotay, are you reading me?

03:52.065 --> 03:53.726
Please answer.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.927
This is Commander Chakotay.

03:56.002 --> 03:57.128
Who are you?

03:57.203 --> 03:59.171
Please, anyone on Voyager,

03:59.239 --> 04:01.173
if you can hear me, I need help.

04:03.476 --> 04:05.205
There has been
an explosion on the vessel.

04:05.278 --> 04:06.870
The hull is
destabilizing.

04:06.946 --> 04:07.776
Life support
is off-line.

04:07.847 --> 04:09.337
Beam her directly to Sick Bay.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.007
Targeting her
coordinates.

04:13.019 --> 04:14.850
I've lost her.
Trying again.

04:16.689 --> 04:18.019
I don't understand.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.456
I get a clear lock;
then it drops out.

04:19.524 --> 04:21.550
If we can get
an away team over there,

04:21.628 --> 04:23.493
we could stabilize her ship
and tractor it in.

04:23.563 --> 04:24.530
Do it.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.657
Tom, Tuvok, let's find out
what's going on.

04:44.617 --> 04:47.552
Environmental systems
are not functioning.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.248
Oxygen levels are
dangerously low.

04:50.323 --> 04:51.984
Tom...

04:52.091 --> 04:53.956
try to get
life support on line.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.551
No life signs.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.892
See if you can
stabilize the hull.

04:59.098 --> 05:00.656
I'll look for the pilot.

05:03.169 --> 05:04.295
Hello?

05:07.573 --> 05:09.302
Can you hear me?

05:09.375 --> 05:12.003
Chakotay, is it you?

05:16.249 --> 05:17.648
Yes.

05:17.717 --> 05:20.686
I'm going to get
this bulkhead off you.

05:20.753 --> 05:22.618
But the beam will fall.

05:28.394 --> 05:30.385
I'm going to pry the bulkhead
off you.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.625
When I say"now," get ready
to roll out of there

05:37.704 --> 05:39.171
like your life depended on it.

05:39.238 --> 05:40.205
All right.

05:40.273 --> 05:41.205
Ready?

05:41.274 --> 05:42.866
Yes.

05:42.942 --> 05:44.637
Now!

05:53.219 --> 05:55.346
I knew you'd come.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.184
Do I know you?

06:00.293 --> 06:01.817
Chakotay to Voyager.

06:01.894 --> 06:03.759
Two to beam directly
to Sick Bay.

06:22.148 --> 06:23.137
How is she?

06:23.216 --> 06:24.706
I'm not certain.

06:24.784 --> 06:26.149
When I scan her,
the readings

06:26.219 --> 06:28.016
won't stay
in the database.

06:28.087 --> 06:30.749
Luckily, I'm a master
of visual diagnosis.

06:30.823 --> 06:31.915
She has a minor
concussion

06:31.991 --> 06:33.424
and a compound
tibular fracture--

06:33.493 --> 06:34.755
nothing
life-threatening.

06:34.827 --> 06:36.351
I can repair
the damage.

06:36.429 --> 06:37.919
Did you find out
how she knows you?

06:37.997 --> 06:39.328
Not yet.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.965
No.

06:44.003 --> 06:45.300
I can't.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.507
She's coming around.

06:55.581 --> 06:56.980
Don't be frightened.

06:57.049 --> 06:58.209
You're quite safe here.

07:05.324 --> 07:10.626
Captain...please...
I need asylum.

07:10.696 --> 07:12.027
You must let me stay
on your ship

07:12.098 --> 07:13.156
and we've got to get away

07:13.232 --> 07:14.164
from here.

07:14.233 --> 07:15.200
They'll be coming
after me.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.235
Slow down a minute.

07:16.302 --> 07:18.497
I have a few questions first.

07:18.571 --> 07:20.630
Who are you?

07:20.706 --> 07:23.197
And how do you know
my First Officer?

07:23.276 --> 07:25.574
It's a complicated story.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.380
I'm not...

07:29.449 --> 07:31.610
I'm not sure...

07:31.684 --> 07:34.118
quite how to begin.

07:34.187 --> 07:37.850
But if you don't give me asylum,
they're going to track me down

07:37.924 --> 07:39.858
and they're going
to take me back.

07:39.926 --> 07:42.554
And I don't want to go.

07:42.628 --> 07:46.029
We won't turn you over to anyone
without knowing the whole story.

07:48.601 --> 07:49.898
Thank you.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.460
Chakotay.

07:52.538 --> 07:54.665
I want you to
stay with her.

07:54.740 --> 07:56.571
She seems to trust you.

07:56.642 --> 07:57.973
Maybe you'll be
able to find out

07:58.044 --> 07:58.976
what this
is all about.

07:59.045 --> 08:01.013
I hope so.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.445
Keep me informed.

08:08.621 --> 08:09.849
Once I've repaired
the fracture,

08:09.956 --> 08:11.423
she'll need
some bed rest.

08:12.425 --> 08:14.359
Will you stay with me?

08:14.427 --> 08:15.985
Of course.

08:17.129 --> 08:18.790
Then I'll be fine.

08:19.899 --> 08:20.866
There.

08:20.933 --> 08:22.423
That should do it.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.130
I'd ask you to monitor
her vital signs,

08:25.204 --> 08:26.569
but since they
aren't registering,

08:26.639 --> 08:27.765
I suppose there's no point.

08:30.977 --> 08:33.207
Well...I have
several days' worth

08:33.279 --> 08:34.905
of inoculation records
to catalog.

08:34.981 --> 08:36.243
I suppose I'll get to it.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.986
Is he gone?

08:43.956 --> 08:45.116
Yes.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.819
Then we're alone.

08:47.894 --> 08:49.657
In a manner of speaking.

08:51.731 --> 08:53.596
Can you start clearing
up a few things now?

08:53.666 --> 08:55.600
I'll try.

08:57.436 --> 08:59.336
It's complicated.

09:01.607 --> 09:04.940
You see...we've met before.

09:05.011 --> 09:08.071
If that were true,
I'm sure I'd remember.

09:08.147 --> 09:09.842
No, you wouldn't.

09:09.949 --> 09:11.712
You couldn't.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.680
You see,
the memories of my people

09:17.757 --> 09:20.851
can't be held in the minds
of other races.

09:20.927 --> 09:23.589
When we encounter others,

09:23.663 --> 09:25.528
which we do...

09:25.598 --> 09:27.463
infrequently,

09:27.533 --> 09:30.593
they remember us
for a few hours...

09:30.670 --> 09:33.639
but then the memories fade away.

09:33.706 --> 09:38.006
We're completely forgotten
by the next day.

09:38.077 --> 09:41.240
Is this done through technology?
Telepathy?

09:41.314 --> 09:43.805
It's a factor of our biology.

09:43.883 --> 09:47.375
You see, our bodies produce
a sort of pheromone,

09:47.453 --> 09:51.219
which blocks the long-term
memory engrams of others.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.781
Is that why the tricorder
can't scan you?

09:53.859 --> 09:55.850
Why we couldn't get
a transporter lock?

09:55.928 --> 09:59.056
We're impervious
to those sort of devices.

09:59.131 --> 10:01.224
Your ships are cloaked as well.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.564
When you live
a covert existence,

10:03.636 --> 10:07.663
you develop technology
to enhance it.

10:10.009 --> 10:11.738
But you say we've met before.

10:11.811 --> 10:13.972
About a month ago.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.015
I spent several weeks here.

10:19.552 --> 10:20.951
Several weeks?

10:21.020 --> 10:23.181
You and I worked
closely together.

10:23.255 --> 10:26.088
You helped me
a great deal.

10:26.158 --> 10:27.887
Then I left...

10:29.462 --> 10:32.625
knowing that you would forget
everything about me.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.690
Then why did you come back?

10:35.768 --> 10:37.599
Why the battle?
Why ask us for asylum?

10:37.670 --> 10:38.637
I know you want

10:38.704 --> 10:40.729
everything in a nutshell.

10:40.806 --> 10:43.240
That's the way you work.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.470
But I have to tell you
the whole story

10:45.544 --> 10:47.307
before it will
make sense.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.780
Fine. I'm listening.

10:51.183 --> 10:52.980
I came back...

10:54.854 --> 10:57.448
because I fell in love with you.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.128
She comes from Ramura.

11:10.202 --> 11:11.931
It's a closed society

11:12.071 --> 11:14.198
that won't tolerate
anybody trying to leave.

11:14.273 --> 11:17.572
Apparently, she was disenchanted
with that and wanted out.

11:17.643 --> 11:19.406
They're trying
to bring her back.

11:19.478 --> 11:21.446
That's why she's asking
for asylum.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.414
But you say
that she claims

11:23.482 --> 11:25.313
she was on Voyager
before this.

11:25.384 --> 11:26.612
About a month ago.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.881
She says she's a"tracer"--

11:28.954 --> 11:31.081
a kind of bounty hunter
who tracks down people

11:31.157 --> 11:32.556
who try to leave their world.

11:32.625 --> 11:35.355
She found a runaway
hiding on Voyager.

11:35.428 --> 11:38.363
She was here,
but nobody remembers it?

11:38.431 --> 11:40.422
That's what she says,
but I think we have to find

11:40.499 --> 11:41.864
a way to verify
her story.

11:41.934 --> 11:43.526
I was looking
at her ship.

11:43.602 --> 11:46.196
It uses a sophisticated
polarization technique

11:46.272 --> 11:49.332
that causes our sensor scans
to pass right through it.

11:49.408 --> 11:51.171
She could have
been shadowing us

11:51.243 --> 11:52.437
for quite
a while.

11:52.511 --> 11:53.637
And learned enough about us

11:53.713 --> 11:55.305
to convince us
she's been here before.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.609
But why?

11:56.682 --> 11:58.013
Why go to that trouble?

11:58.084 --> 12:01.645
What about the battle
with that other cloaked ship?

12:01.721 --> 12:03.780
She put herself in danger

12:03.856 --> 12:05.687
when it would have
been a lot easier

12:05.758 --> 12:07.089
simply to ask for asylum.

12:07.159 --> 12:08.490
I agree...

12:08.561 --> 12:09.926
but I think
we have to make sure

12:10.029 --> 12:11.690
she doesn't have
some hidden agenda.

12:11.764 --> 12:14.562
If she was here, there should
be some evidence of it.

12:14.633 --> 12:17.659
She said a computer
virus was planted

12:17.737 --> 12:19.932
to wipe all references
to her being here,

12:20.005 --> 12:22.439
but I have to believe
we can at least turn up

12:22.508 --> 12:23.372
some evidence of tampering.

12:23.442 --> 12:25.376
Harry, Tuvok.
Tom,

12:25.444 --> 12:27.139
do the same
with her ship.

12:27.213 --> 12:29.977
See if the navigational logs
support what she's saying.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.515
Gentlemen.

12:34.353 --> 12:36.412
I agree we should
take precautions,

12:36.489 --> 12:39.219
but you seem very
suspicious of her.

12:39.291 --> 12:40.986
I want to make sure
we're not being manipulated.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.994
I agree.

12:43.062 --> 12:44.791
If we grant her asylum,

12:44.864 --> 12:47.128
we'll be in the position
of having to protect her.

12:47.199 --> 12:48.461
If we're going to commit
to that,

12:48.534 --> 12:50.764
we should certainly find out
if she's telling the truth.

12:50.836 --> 12:53.304
I'd appreciate your thoughts
on that.

12:53.372 --> 12:54.896
Aye, Captain.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.075
I have successfully
downloaded

13:00.146 --> 13:02.205
the navigational logs
from your vessel.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.044
Good. Now, compare them
with your own logs

13:04.116 --> 13:05.208
over the last two months.

13:05.284 --> 13:08.253
Display Voyager's route
toward the Alpha Quadrant.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.347
Now overlay my route.

13:12.925 --> 13:14.916
There, you see?

13:14.994 --> 13:17.019
Our ships traveled together
for at least two weeks.

13:17.096 --> 13:20.395
You could have falsified
your navigational logs.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.525
There is no proof that you
ever came aboard Voyager.

13:22.601 --> 13:25.126
That's what I always liked
about you two--

13:25.204 --> 13:28.970
such unyielding logic,
such refreshing skepticism.

13:29.074 --> 13:30.541
Run a diagnostic on my logs.

13:30.609 --> 13:32.577
You'll find
they haven't been altered.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.405
How's it going?

13:35.481 --> 13:37.312
Her story seems
to be legitimate,

13:37.383 --> 13:39.248
but there are
further steps to take.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.307
Then take them.

13:40.386 --> 13:42.377
I thought you might like
to get something to eat--

13:42.454 --> 13:44.388
unless your memories
of our Mess Hall aren't good.

13:44.456 --> 13:45.445
As a matter of fact,

13:45.524 --> 13:47.253
I was quite fond
of Neelix's food.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.021
Now, that's something
that's hard to believe.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.994
Commander Chakotay's
face became flushed

13:56.101 --> 13:57.568
as he spoke with her.

13:57.636 --> 13:59.194
What does that signify?

13:59.271 --> 14:01.466
I'd rather not engage
in speculation.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.542
It is a dangerous pastime.

14:09.748 --> 14:12.012
I think our guest
will enjoy this, Commander--

14:12.084 --> 14:15.212
uh, fried soy meal,
buttered carrots

14:15.287 --> 14:17.517
and a delightful almond pudding.

14:17.590 --> 14:18.784
Sounds wonderful.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.587
Very nice.
Thanks, Neelix.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.892
You were very diplomatic.

14:23.963 --> 14:25.089
Why do you say that?

14:25.164 --> 14:27.928
You hate carrots;
fried food upsets your stomach;

14:28.000 --> 14:31.766
and you refuse to eat pudding
because you think it's slimy.

14:31.837 --> 14:33.998
Right?

14:35.941 --> 14:36.930
I'm curious.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.203
When you were here before,
you said we worked together,

14:39.278 --> 14:41.371
but you also said you were
here to retrieve a runaway.

14:41.447 --> 14:43.108
How was I involved?

14:43.182 --> 14:44.547
Aren't you more curious

14:44.617 --> 14:46.642
to hear about
how we fell in love?

14:46.719 --> 14:48.983
"We"? You said you
were in love with me.

14:49.088 --> 14:51.147
You didn't say I
felt the same way.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.690
If you hadn't returned
the feelings,

14:52.758 --> 14:54.282
do you really think
I would have taken

14:54.360 --> 14:56.055
such a terrible risk
to get back to you?

14:59.498 --> 15:02.228
Let's take it
one step at a time.

15:02.334 --> 15:04.131
How did you get on our ship?

15:04.169 --> 15:05.193
That was easy.

15:05.271 --> 15:07.239
The hard part was looking
for the runaway

15:07.306 --> 15:08.637
without anyone finding me.

15:08.707 --> 15:10.732
I managed two days on the ship
before I triggered

15:10.809 --> 15:12.868
an intruder alert
and lost my cloak.

15:13.012 --> 15:14.673
And then what happened?

15:14.747 --> 15:17.341
And then I met you.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.068
Wrong direction.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.836
I don't want to hurt you.

15:43.909 --> 15:45.342
Put your weapon down.

15:45.411 --> 15:47.709
On my ship,
I give the orders.

15:47.780 --> 15:48.940
Put yours down.

15:49.014 --> 15:51.278
I don't mean you any harm.

15:51.350 --> 15:53.375
You have a stowaway
on board.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.682
I'll retrieve him, and
we'll be on our way.

15:55.754 --> 15:57.346
That's not the way
we do things here.

15:57.423 --> 16:00.221
Chakotay to Tuvok.
I'm in Cargo Bay 2.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.226
I have our intruder.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.194
Understood, Commander.

16:04.263 --> 16:06.857
You're about to find yourself
outnumbered.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.763
If you want
to give me your weapon

16:08.834 --> 16:12.531
and explain what's going on,
I'll listen.

16:22.881 --> 16:25.076
I felt an attraction right away,

16:25.150 --> 16:27.914
but I couldn't afford
to get distracted.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.181
I had work to do.

16:29.254 --> 16:32.018
And I didn't know
if you felt it, too.

16:32.091 --> 16:33.922
What happened next?

16:33.993 --> 16:37.895
You took me
to Captain Janeway.

16:37.963 --> 16:39.760
I explained the situation.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.925
She didn't like the idea
of a stowaway

16:42.001 --> 16:44.094
on her ship,
so she told you and Tuvok

16:44.169 --> 16:45.932
to work with me
to flush him out.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.063
And did we?

16:47.139 --> 16:50.336
You keep trying
to jump to the end.

16:50.409 --> 16:52.343
You're skipping all the parts
about us.

16:52.411 --> 16:54.470
And you keep trying to
talk about your feelings.

16:54.546 --> 16:56.241
I'd rather you
stick to the events,

16:56.315 --> 16:57.942
not the emotions
surrounding them.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.985
Why?

17:00.019 --> 17:02.146
Does it make you uncomfortable?

17:03.655 --> 17:05.623
I don't want to play this game.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.318
I've been assigned
to talk to you--

17:07.393 --> 17:10.055
to figure out whether or not
you're telling the truth.

17:10.128 --> 17:13.496
Even if you are,
I have no memory of meeting you

17:13.565 --> 17:15.556
and I certainly have no memory
of feeling anything

17:15.634 --> 17:16.862
for you.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.060
You might remember
a relationship

17:18.137 --> 17:20.605
between us,
but as far as I'm concerned...

17:20.672 --> 17:23.903
it didn't exist.

17:24.009 --> 17:26.034
I see.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.348
I'm sorry.

17:36.422 --> 17:38.856
I just want to make
it clear how I feel.

17:40.626 --> 17:42.685
Of course.

17:42.761 --> 17:45.195
Is there anything
I can do for you?

17:48.033 --> 17:50.194
Can I have your pudding?

17:54.006 --> 17:55.667
Gladly.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.208
Then you're forgiven.

17:59.745 --> 18:00.643
Chakotay and Kellin,

18:00.746 --> 18:01.974
report to the Bridge
immediately.

18:02.014 --> 18:04.141
It's the tracers.
They've found me.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.624
We don't detect any ships.

18:15.694 --> 18:18.026
I'm assuming these are
your people in cloaked vessels.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.724
They've come
to take me back.

18:19.798 --> 18:21.026
Harry, hail them.

18:21.100 --> 18:21.964
They won't answer.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.228
She's right, Captain.

18:23.302 --> 18:24.860
No response.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.367
Their weapons
are going

18:27.439 --> 18:28.997
through our shields
as if they weren't there.

18:29.074 --> 18:31.770
Match shields to the frequency
of their particle beams.

18:33.479 --> 18:34.912
No effect.

18:34.980 --> 18:37.346
Shield strength
down to 29 percent.

18:37.416 --> 18:39.441
They'll keep firing
until you surrender

18:39.518 --> 18:42.009
or until I contact them
and agree to come back.

18:42.087 --> 18:43.577
Do you still want
to stay with us?

18:43.655 --> 18:45.350
Yes.

18:45.424 --> 18:46.789
All right. Tom,

18:46.859 --> 18:47.917
get us out of here.

18:47.993 --> 18:50.484
That last volley
damaged our propulsion systems.

18:50.562 --> 18:51.756
We have thrusters only.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.923
Captain, if you'll
let me have access

18:53.999 --> 18:55.398
to your sensor systems,

18:55.467 --> 18:57.458
I can modify them
to detect the ships.

18:57.536 --> 18:59.265
Do it.

18:59.338 --> 19:01.806
This is the moment,
Chakotay.

19:01.907 --> 19:03.841
Either we give her up
or we fire back.

19:03.909 --> 19:04.898
Which one is it?

19:07.479 --> 19:10.141
Fire.

19:10.215 --> 19:11.113
I think you might

19:11.183 --> 19:12.115
be able to detect
them now,

19:12.184 --> 19:13.116
but only for
a minute or two.

19:13.185 --> 19:14.117
Harry.

19:14.186 --> 19:15.744
Affirmative.
Two heavily armed ships

19:15.821 --> 19:17.186
off the port bow.

19:17.256 --> 19:18.382
Can we get them on screen?

19:20.192 --> 19:21.284
That's the best I can do.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.397
Tuvok.

19:26.465 --> 19:27.955
target their weapon systems.

19:29.134 --> 19:30.396
Firing.

19:36.808 --> 19:38.469
Well done.

19:38.544 --> 19:40.307
Stand down Red Alert.

19:40.379 --> 19:43.212
Well, it seems we've
granted you asylum.

19:43.282 --> 19:44.647
Now you'll have to give

19:44.716 --> 19:46.911
some thought to what
you want to do.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.917
I'd prefer to remain on board.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.148
Consider that
carefully.

19:51.223 --> 19:53.020
We're heading
for the Alpha Quadrant.

19:53.091 --> 19:55.252
Before long, we will be
so far from your world

19:55.327 --> 19:56.294
that if you change your mind,

19:56.361 --> 19:57.487
you wouldn't be able
to get back.

19:57.563 --> 20:00.930
I won't change my mind,
but I must warn you--

20:00.999 --> 20:03.160
the tracers won't give up
that easily.

20:03.235 --> 20:04.793
Your ship is still at risk.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.804
Nothing we haven't
faced before.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.931
I was only able to make
a temporary modification

20:09.041 --> 20:10.474
to your sensors.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.976
If you'd let me access
your astrometric processors,

20:13.045 --> 20:14.979
I could make
that modification permanent.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.981
You'll need a command
officer with you

20:17.049 --> 20:18.744
to override the
security lockouts.

20:18.817 --> 20:20.045
I can do that, Captain.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.042
Go ahead.

20:24.990 --> 20:26.457
Tom, coordinate
with Engineering

20:26.525 --> 20:28.823
to get the propulsion systems
back on line.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.156
I'm on it, Captain.

20:40.606 --> 20:42.540
We'll have to climb
up to Deck 10.

20:45.143 --> 20:46.201
Is something wrong?

20:50.182 --> 20:52.582
I can't relax
until we're far enough away

20:52.651 --> 20:55.176
that they realize
they can't get me back...

20:55.254 --> 20:58.815
and to my knowledge,
that's never happened before.

20:58.890 --> 21:01.450
There's always
a first time.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.960
I have a high
security clearance.

21:03.996 --> 21:05.623
They'll be afraid
I'm going to do

21:05.697 --> 21:07.221
exactly what I'm about to do--

21:07.299 --> 21:09.494
show you how to detect them.

21:12.037 --> 21:13.504
Look at it this way.

21:13.572 --> 21:15.164
If they do figure out
we can spot them,

21:15.240 --> 21:16.332
they might realize

21:16.408 --> 21:18.501
they aren't going to be
able to take you back.

21:22.848 --> 21:25.146
You're such a kind person.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.208
That's what I
remembered most.

21:30.222 --> 21:33.282
It's what made me
turn around and come back.

21:33.358 --> 21:36.885
And sometime...

21:36.962 --> 21:39.897
you might be interested in...

21:39.965 --> 21:43.196
hearing about
our last night together.

21:51.677 --> 21:53.440
Evening, Commander.

21:53.512 --> 21:56.242
Craving
a late-night snack?

21:56.315 --> 21:58.749
No. Something
to help me sleep.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.717
Got any ideas?

22:00.819 --> 22:04.778
I know humans think
warm milk will do it.

22:04.823 --> 22:07.257
Frankly,
I find it repulsive.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.725
I agree.

22:08.794 --> 22:10.455
What's available
in the tea area?

22:10.529 --> 22:12.827
Herbal is best.

22:12.898 --> 22:16.425
I have several
Terran varieties, uh...

22:16.501 --> 22:19.470
as well as some
more exotic blends.

22:19.538 --> 22:21.028
Just mix me up
whatever you think

22:21.106 --> 22:22.130
is the most relaxing.

22:25.544 --> 22:26.943
Problems?

22:28.380 --> 22:30.712
Forgive me.
I wasn't trying to pry.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.073
I know that.

22:33.151 --> 22:34.812
I'm just not sure
how to answer you.

22:34.886 --> 22:38.185
How's our guest adapting
to life on Voyager?

22:38.256 --> 22:39.917
Quite well, I think.

22:39.991 --> 22:41.549
She must be happy
to be here.

22:41.626 --> 22:43.184
I'm sure she is.

22:47.399 --> 22:49.367
Forgive me, Commander...

22:51.036 --> 22:54.472
but sometimes it's best
to be straightforward.

22:54.539 --> 22:57.406
It's obvious
how she feels about you--

22:57.476 --> 22:58.738
to me, at least.

22:58.810 --> 23:00.471
I see how she looks at you.

23:00.579 --> 23:03.639
Might that be the source
of your consternation?

23:06.918 --> 23:08.681
She says she, or rather

23:08.754 --> 23:11.655
we fell in love when
she was here before.

23:11.723 --> 23:13.554
Since I can't
remember any of that,

23:13.625 --> 23:15.024
I don't know if it's true,

23:15.093 --> 23:17.186
but somehow, it's
hard to believe.

23:17.262 --> 23:19.059
Why is that?

23:19.131 --> 23:20.063
I don't know.

23:20.132 --> 23:22.066
It just doesn't seem like me.

23:22.134 --> 23:24.068
I'm still suspicious of her.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.434
I don't know
if she's using me in some way

23:26.505 --> 23:28.735
just for her own purposes.

23:28.807 --> 23:31.241
You don't trust her.

23:32.844 --> 23:34.243
Not really.

23:39.551 --> 23:42.714
May I suggest...

23:42.788 --> 23:45.586
that maybe it's yourself
you don't trust?

23:45.657 --> 23:47.750
Your own feelings
that you're afraid of?

23:49.761 --> 23:51.820
Sweet dreams.

24:12.617 --> 24:14.778
I couldn't sleep.

24:14.853 --> 24:17.048
I need to talk to you.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.113
May I come in?

24:23.995 --> 24:25.257
I was just wondering

24:25.330 --> 24:27.298
if you still had
doubts about me

24:27.365 --> 24:31.028
or if you believe what
I told you about us.

24:32.804 --> 24:35.170
Your story seems
to have been verified.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.435
I believe you're
telling the truth.

24:37.509 --> 24:38.999
And the rest of it?

24:40.745 --> 24:42.303
What about us?

24:50.188 --> 24:52.748
I'm not one to hold back,
as you may have noticed,

24:52.824 --> 24:54.815
so I'll get to the point.

24:54.893 --> 24:57.885
I came here because of you.

24:57.963 --> 25:01.364
I knew you wouldn't
remember me,

25:01.433 --> 25:03.731
but I was sure
we could regain

25:03.802 --> 25:06.396
the feelings
we had before.

25:06.471 --> 25:09.338
They were there...

25:09.407 --> 25:12.535
and they were real...

25:12.611 --> 25:16.103
but now I'm not so sure.

25:17.549 --> 25:19.073
My being here puts

25:19.150 --> 25:21.209
this ship at risk.

25:21.286 --> 25:24.483
It's better for everyone
if I go back to Ramura.

25:26.892 --> 25:29.759
So please be honest.

25:29.828 --> 25:33.662
If you feel nothing for me...

25:33.732 --> 25:36.360
just tell me...

25:36.434 --> 25:38.026
and I'll leave.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.506
Don't go.

25:57.455 --> 25:59.980
It's called "ice cream"?

26:00.025 --> 26:01.356
I'm surprised
you didn't have any

26:01.426 --> 26:02.859
the last time you were here.

26:02.928 --> 26:05.453
I could eat
this every day.

26:05.530 --> 26:07.896
Then you should.

26:11.836 --> 26:13.963
Voyager's a very...

26:14.039 --> 26:15.734
powerful ship.

26:15.807 --> 26:18.435
And very fast.

26:18.510 --> 26:21.001
We've met people
with ships that are faster

26:21.079 --> 26:22.603
and more powerful,

26:22.681 --> 26:24.649
but Voyager's always
managed to be a match

26:24.716 --> 26:25.705
for the best of them.

26:29.988 --> 26:32.183
Ramuran vessels are fast.

26:34.526 --> 26:37.017
They could stay up
with this ship.

26:37.095 --> 26:39.188
Kellin...

26:39.264 --> 26:41.232
we'll keep you safe.

26:41.299 --> 26:42.664
That's a promise.

26:42.734 --> 26:45.703
A tracer never goes
home empty-handed.

26:45.770 --> 26:48.238
The disgrace would be too great.

26:48.306 --> 26:49.466
When I was here before,

26:49.541 --> 26:51.975
I'd been tracking that man
for almost a year.

26:52.043 --> 26:53.670
But you know all the tricks.

26:53.745 --> 26:54.973
You can use them
against anyone

26:55.046 --> 26:56.240
who tries to come after you.

27:03.021 --> 27:04.283
You said you were
going to tell me

27:04.356 --> 27:05.550
about our last night together.

27:06.558 --> 27:08.355
Let me show you.

27:10.128 --> 27:13.586
You were sitting here
in this chair...

27:15.233 --> 27:18.134
and I...

27:18.203 --> 27:20.398
was here.

27:20.472 --> 27:23.635
And we were drinking
something with bubbles.

27:23.708 --> 27:25.505
Champagne?

27:25.577 --> 27:26.874
Yes.

27:26.945 --> 27:28.640
I wanted to celebrate.

27:28.713 --> 27:31.477
I'd caught my runaway that day
with your help.

27:31.549 --> 27:32.538
How was that?

27:32.617 --> 27:34.016
You came up with the idea

27:34.085 --> 27:35.916
of using a magneton sweep

27:35.987 --> 27:37.818
to disrupt his
polarization cloak.

27:37.889 --> 27:39.584
We knew he'd be
watching me closely,

27:39.658 --> 27:42.855
so...we tricked him.

27:47.032 --> 27:49.500
I'm sorry you didn't
get your fugitive.

27:49.567 --> 27:51.865
He must have jumped
to another ship

27:51.936 --> 27:54.530
while Voyager was in
orbit of Mikah last week.

27:54.606 --> 27:56.233
I'll find him eventually.

27:56.307 --> 27:58.639
If you think we could be
of any more help, let me know.

27:58.710 --> 27:59.972
Thank you, Commander.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.273
This is my problem.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.280
I'll handle it from now on.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.749
Just beam me
back to my ship

28:06.818 --> 28:09.082
and I'll backtrack to Mikah.

28:09.154 --> 28:12.715
Good-bye, and thank you again.

28:12.791 --> 28:14.190
Ready to energize.

28:24.402 --> 28:25.494
Hello, Resket.

28:25.570 --> 28:27.060
You were
a real challenge.

28:27.138 --> 28:28.196
I haven't had
the chance

28:28.273 --> 28:29.706
to welcome you to Voyager.

28:29.774 --> 28:31.605
Too bad you'll
be leaving so soon.

28:33.511 --> 28:34.978
We put him in the brig.

28:35.046 --> 28:37.014
Once I used
the neurolytic emitter on him,

28:37.082 --> 28:39.380
he was only too happy
to be going home again.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.112
Neurolytic emitter.

28:41.186 --> 28:42.551
We use it on runaways.

28:42.620 --> 28:45.020
It wipes their memories
of the outside world.

28:45.090 --> 28:48.287
So we were
celebrating...?

28:48.359 --> 28:51.123
You'd become much more
than a friend to me,

28:51.196 --> 28:52.561
but I knew
I had to go home,

28:52.630 --> 28:54.621
and you'd forget about me
within hours.

28:54.699 --> 28:57.259
So I took the initiative.

28:57.335 --> 28:59.098
More than usual?

28:59.170 --> 29:00.933
Oh, yes.

29:03.508 --> 29:05.476
I moved closer to you...

29:07.412 --> 29:11.746
I thanked you profusely
for all your help,

29:11.816 --> 29:14.080
told you that I couldn't
have done it without you...

29:20.191 --> 29:22.682
and I touched you.

29:22.761 --> 29:26.629
I told you I...
I cared very much for you...

29:28.299 --> 29:30.927
and that I wanted something
to remember you by.

29:33.671 --> 29:35.263
And then I did this.

29:58.897 --> 30:01.331
That's when I knew
you felt the same way.

30:03.768 --> 30:06.293
But it didn't matter
because I still had to go.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.403
But now you don't.

30:26.624 --> 30:28.649
If Kellin's going
to be with us,

30:28.726 --> 30:30.353
the Captain wants her
to serve a function--

30:30.428 --> 30:31.793
to contribute in some way.

30:31.863 --> 30:33.490
A reasonable
expectation.

30:33.565 --> 30:34.827
What are her skills?

30:34.899 --> 30:38.096
Basically, she was a security
operative for her people.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.000
She's a trained expert
in weaponry,

30:40.104 --> 30:42.572
surveillance,
fighting skills.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.665
Any idea where she
might fit in?

30:44.742 --> 30:47.643
Mr. Neelix could use an
assistant in the Mess Hall.

30:47.712 --> 30:51.739
Tuvok, that was a joke.

30:51.816 --> 30:53.977
Don't deny it--
you were trying to be funny.

30:54.052 --> 30:56.646
If you choose to interpret
my remark as humorous,

30:56.721 --> 30:57.915
that is your decision.

30:57.989 --> 30:59.889
I do and it was.

30:59.958 --> 31:01.585
It's perfectly logical.

31:01.693 --> 31:02.785
All the qualities
you mentioned

31:02.827 --> 31:03.885
would help in
defending Neelix

31:03.962 --> 31:05.759
against the periodic
wrath of the crew.

31:06.965 --> 31:09.263
Maybe so, but don't you
think she'd be better off

31:09.334 --> 31:11.165
as a member
of your security detail?

31:11.236 --> 31:13.170
Perhaps. I'll assign
her to a team

31:13.238 --> 31:15.069
and let her
observe for a week.

31:15.139 --> 31:17.505
At the end of that time,
I'll evaluate her situation.

31:17.575 --> 31:18.667
Good enough.

31:18.743 --> 31:21.712
Commander, I've been giving
some thought to the fact

31:21.779 --> 31:24.145
that the Ramuran ships
might be in pursuit

31:24.215 --> 31:25.546
and could attack us again.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.414
I've given that
some thought myself.

31:27.485 --> 31:28.975
Their proton weapons

31:29.053 --> 31:30.816
were particularly
effective against us.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.858
If Kellin would work
with Seven and Ensign Kim,

31:33.925 --> 31:34.983
perhaps we could devise

31:35.059 --> 31:36.458
a strategy to
defend ourselves.

31:36.527 --> 31:37.994
I'm sure she'd be happy
to do that.

31:38.062 --> 31:39.859
Have her report
to Astrometrics

31:39.931 --> 31:41.125
at 1300 hours.

31:49.407 --> 31:52.376
I've downloaded data
from our tactical logs.

31:52.443 --> 31:54.308
You can access it
from this console.

31:57.982 --> 32:00.416
Our weapons are proton-
based particle beams,

32:00.485 --> 32:01.747
very tightly focused.

32:01.819 --> 32:04.845
It's like being hit
with thousands of needles.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.185
They can penetrate
any shield

32:06.257 --> 32:08.122
even if the modulations
are changed.

32:08.192 --> 32:09.921
Very clever.

32:10.028 --> 32:12.496
No defense has ever
stopped these weapons.

32:12.563 --> 32:14.497
Then maybe we're
about to make history.

32:14.565 --> 32:15.862
You've found a way
to counteract them?

32:15.934 --> 32:17.367
I think so.

32:17.435 --> 32:19.027
The trick is to scatter
those beams a little,

32:19.103 --> 32:21.196
make it harder for them
to penetrate the shields.

32:21.272 --> 32:23.934
I think we could do that
by tying the baryon sensors

32:24.008 --> 32:25.566
into Deflector Control.

32:25.643 --> 32:27.167
Here's what I have in mind.

32:27.245 --> 32:28.974
Why don't you look this over
and let me know what you think?

32:29.047 --> 32:30.275
I'll do it right away.

32:30.348 --> 32:33.374
By the way, I hear Chakotay
recommended you to Tuvok

32:33.451 --> 32:35.146
to serve on a security detail.

32:35.219 --> 32:37.483
I want to help out
in some way.

32:37.555 --> 32:38.487
A word of advice.

32:38.556 --> 32:40.353
Volunteer for Beta Squad;
they're the best team.

32:40.425 --> 32:41.517
You'll learn a lot from them.

32:41.592 --> 32:43.321
I will. Thank you.

32:47.298 --> 32:49.323
When you mentioned
Commander Chakotay's name,

32:49.400 --> 32:50.799
she flushed.

32:50.868 --> 32:52.631
He did the same
when he saw her.

32:52.704 --> 32:54.262
What are you saying?

32:54.339 --> 32:57.274
I suspect the Commander
and Kellin are engaged

32:57.342 --> 32:59.003
in a courtship ritual.

32:59.110 --> 33:01.510
It seems an unnecessary
and complicated precursor

33:01.612 --> 33:03.170
to the act of procreation.

33:04.549 --> 33:06.346
I know you think so,

33:06.417 --> 33:09.079
but trust me, some people
need those rituals.

33:10.521 --> 33:11.681
Explain.

33:11.756 --> 33:14.224
It's...it's usually considered
a good idea

33:14.292 --> 33:16.920
if two people get to know
each other a little

33:16.995 --> 33:20.158
before they become...intimate.

33:20.231 --> 33:21.698
Why is that?

33:23.067 --> 33:25.092
Because it's more comfortable.

33:25.169 --> 33:28.297
Uh, you spend some time
together, you laugh, you talk.

33:28.373 --> 33:30.773
That makes it easier to...

33:30.842 --> 33:32.605
to get closer.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.941
But the end result is the same,
is it not?

33:36.280 --> 33:37.474
Well, I guess so.

33:37.548 --> 33:40.449
Then I fail to see what is
accomplished by all the talk.

33:40.518 --> 33:43.316
Seven, if you don't get it,
then I can't explain it to you.

33:43.388 --> 33:45.288
Obviously.

34:32.136 --> 34:33.433
I should have known.

34:33.504 --> 34:34.766
They must have gotten
somebody on board

34:34.839 --> 34:35.806
during the battle.

34:35.873 --> 34:36.897
You're jumping
to conclusions.

34:36.974 --> 34:38.339
No. There's a tracer.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.138
He's here, he's
come for me.

34:40.210 --> 34:41.803
That broken vase
was a warning.

34:41.879 --> 34:43.210
We'll protect you.

34:43.281 --> 34:44.908
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

34:44.982 --> 34:46.540
- It's too late.
- No!

34:46.617 --> 34:48.244
We can use
the same magneton sweep

34:48.319 --> 34:49.752
we used to flush out Resket.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.846
We'll find this one
and send him on his way.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.286
I'm afraid
I can't let that happen.

34:55.359 --> 34:56.291
Curneth, don't.

34:56.360 --> 34:57.657
Chakotay to Security.

34:57.728 --> 34:59.491
Intruder alert,
my quarters.

34:59.564 --> 35:03.125
Please, I beg you,
don't do this.

35:03.234 --> 35:05.668
You know better
than to ask that, Kellin.

35:05.703 --> 35:07.330
No!

35:07.405 --> 35:08.429
Drop it!

35:08.506 --> 35:09.473
Drop it!

35:09.540 --> 35:11.906
You're too late.

35:11.976 --> 35:13.534
She's already
beginning to forget

35:13.611 --> 35:15.306
everything that's happened here.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.705
The Doctor says
there's nothing he can do.

35:49.780 --> 35:51.873
Your recent memories
have already begun to fade.

35:51.949 --> 35:54.315
Don't let this
happen, please.

35:54.385 --> 35:55.875
Don't let this happen.

35:55.953 --> 35:59.548
Do you have any idea
how we can reverse the effect?

36:02.927 --> 36:04.952
Promise me...

36:05.029 --> 36:07.554
if I forget
why I'm here,

36:07.632 --> 36:11.068
if I forget you...

36:11.135 --> 36:14.502
do what I did...

36:14.572 --> 36:17.439
and you'll tell me
all about us...

36:17.508 --> 36:21.672
and you'll help
me to remember.

36:21.746 --> 36:26.615
I will, but I'm going
to try to do more than that.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.134
Can the effects
of the neurolytic emitter

36:44.202 --> 36:45.567
be reversed?

36:45.636 --> 36:47.263
Reversed?

36:47.338 --> 36:49.169
I have no idea.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.674
As far as I know,
no one's ever tried.

36:51.742 --> 36:53.403
Then I'll be the first.

36:53.477 --> 36:55.240
Tell me how the emitter works--

36:55.313 --> 36:56.712
how it affects
the memory centers.

36:56.781 --> 36:59.841
You sound desperate, Commander.

36:59.917 --> 37:02.215
Does Kellin mean
that much to you?

37:02.320 --> 37:03.719
What you're doing is wrong.

37:03.754 --> 37:04.948
She wants to stay here.

37:05.022 --> 37:07.252
This is futile.

37:07.325 --> 37:10.158
Even if I knew
how the emitter works,

37:10.228 --> 37:12.162
I wouldn't tell you.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.136
You have no right
to do this.

37:26.210 --> 37:27.734
I have every right.

37:27.812 --> 37:31.748
The laws on our world are
very specific about that.

37:31.816 --> 37:33.909
No one may leave.

37:33.985 --> 37:35.885
No one may reveal
anything about us

37:35.953 --> 37:37.113
to the outside world.

37:37.188 --> 37:40.055
Kellin has violated
both of those edicts.

37:40.124 --> 37:41.921
Returning her will
serve as a deterrent

37:41.993 --> 37:44.461
to others who might
think of leaving.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.390
Did it ever occur to you

37:47.465 --> 37:49.365
that the fact that so many
people want to leave might mean

37:49.433 --> 37:51.196
that there's something wrong
with your society?

37:51.269 --> 37:54.568
We have a strong
and cohesive society

37:54.639 --> 37:57.665
because of our efforts
to keep it that way.

37:57.742 --> 37:59.937
A few runaways among millions

38:00.011 --> 38:01.774
hardly indicates
a problem.

38:01.812 --> 38:03.074
If there are so few...

38:05.683 --> 38:07.116
why not let them go?

38:07.184 --> 38:10.415
That would suggest that
we don't care about them.

38:10.488 --> 38:13.150
What a terrible message.

38:13.224 --> 38:17.160
You may have wiped her memory,
but Kellin's not going back.

38:17.228 --> 38:20.026
Maybe we should wait and
see if that's what happens.

38:20.097 --> 38:21.223
She made it

38:21.299 --> 38:23.290
clear to me
that she wants to stay here.

38:23.367 --> 38:25.858
So maybe you
should start practicing

38:25.936 --> 38:27.563
what you're going
to tell your superiors.

38:45.222 --> 38:47.349
Yes?

38:52.396 --> 38:54.193
The Doctor told me
he'd released you.

38:54.265 --> 38:55.254
How are you feeling?

38:55.333 --> 38:57.130
I'm fine.

38:57.201 --> 38:59.294
Do I know you?

39:01.305 --> 39:03.398
Yes.

39:03.474 --> 39:04.668
At least, you did.

39:08.446 --> 39:09.845
You'll have to forgive me,

39:09.914 --> 39:11.609
but I don't remember
how I got here

39:11.682 --> 39:13.547
or anything else
that's happened

39:13.617 --> 39:15.448
in at least the
past few weeks.

39:15.519 --> 39:17.419
I know.

39:17.488 --> 39:21.549
I hope I wasn't throwing
things in a fit of rage.

39:21.625 --> 39:23.354
No.

39:23.427 --> 39:27.193
I assume a tracer is
here to take me back.

39:27.264 --> 39:28.925
That's right.

39:30.468 --> 39:31.935
But...

39:36.073 --> 39:37.768
what I'm going to say
will sound strange...

39:42.380 --> 39:45.042
but it's what you
asked me to do

39:45.116 --> 39:47.448
before you lost
your memories.

39:47.518 --> 39:49.042
You came here
about a month ago

39:49.120 --> 39:51.088
looking for a runaway.

39:51.155 --> 39:54.647
After you left with him,
you decided to come back.

39:54.725 --> 39:57.626
But if I finished
my assignment,

39:57.695 --> 39:58.821
why would I come back here?

39:58.896 --> 40:00.090
Because...

40:01.799 --> 40:04.029
you'd fallen
in love with me.

40:08.072 --> 40:09.539
Forgive me.

40:09.607 --> 40:11.370
You're...certainly attractive,

40:11.442 --> 40:13.410
but...what
you're telling me

40:13.477 --> 40:15.536
seems very unlikely.

40:15.613 --> 40:17.478
But it's what
happened.

40:17.548 --> 40:20.984
We started to
work together...

40:21.085 --> 40:24.646
and I began to realize
how unique you are.

40:24.722 --> 40:27.987
Before long, I couldn't
get you out of my mind.

40:28.058 --> 40:32.222
Are you saying that you fell
in love with me as well?

40:32.296 --> 40:35.129
Yes.

40:35.199 --> 40:38.657
And then we realized
the tracer was on board.

40:38.736 --> 40:40.704
After he used
the emitter on you,

40:40.771 --> 40:43.205
you made me promise to
tell you all of this,

40:43.274 --> 40:45.174
so you would know what
happened between us.

40:47.211 --> 40:48.508
This is...

40:48.579 --> 40:50.342
a little unsettling.

40:52.683 --> 40:54.378
What is it
you want from me?

40:56.220 --> 40:58.586
Kellin...

40:58.656 --> 41:00.851
don't go back
with the tracer.

41:00.958 --> 41:03.552
Stay here for a while,
at least for a few days.

41:03.594 --> 41:07.928
We can get to know
each other again.

41:07.998 --> 41:12.401
I honestly can't imagine
what would be served by that.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.165
I have to go home.

41:14.238 --> 41:15.933
If you stayed...

41:16.006 --> 41:19.271
you might change
your mind.

41:19.343 --> 41:21.208
Then that's
all the more reason

41:21.278 --> 41:23.974
that I should leave now.

41:24.048 --> 41:27.779
I've violated one
of our most important edicts...

41:29.353 --> 41:32.220
and I wouldn't want
to make that mistake again.

41:37.361 --> 41:38.988
I wish...

41:44.134 --> 41:47.126
I wish we had met
under different circumstances.

42:11.328 --> 42:13.193
Your ship's ready.

42:13.264 --> 42:15.027
Thank you,
Commander.

42:15.099 --> 42:16.828
I've implanted
a computer virus

42:16.901 --> 42:19.495
to eliminate any reference
to our being here.

42:19.570 --> 42:21.162
By tomorrow afternoon,

42:21.238 --> 42:22.398
you'll have forgotten
everything.

42:22.473 --> 42:24.941
It will be as though
we never existed.

42:25.042 --> 42:26.509
It's better that way.

42:26.577 --> 42:28.772
You're such
a kind person.

42:28.846 --> 42:31.542
I won't forget that.

42:33.183 --> 42:35.174
I wish you both the best.

42:56.473 --> 42:58.304
Energize.

43:07.184 --> 43:12.178
First Officer's Personal Log,
Stardate 51813. 4.

43:12.256 --> 43:15.419
Maybe it would be best,
as the tracer said,

43:15.492 --> 43:17.619
to forget about Kellin
and the time she spent here,

43:17.695 --> 43:20.357
but I don't want to do that.

43:20.431 --> 43:22.456
I want to remember.

43:22.533 --> 43:24.728
More coffee, Commander?

43:24.802 --> 43:26.099
No, thanks.

43:26.170 --> 43:27.933
I'm almost done.

43:29.273 --> 43:31.503
Strange to
see you using

43:31.575 --> 43:33.873
those ancient
writing implements.

43:33.944 --> 43:36.845
Ah, it's the only way
I could get a permanent record

43:36.914 --> 43:39.144
of what's happened
in the last few days.

43:39.216 --> 43:41.446
I want to get it down
before I forget it all.

43:42.953 --> 43:44.284
I'm sorry things

43:44.355 --> 43:46.016
didn't work
out for you.

43:48.459 --> 43:51.986
I've been trying
to make sense of it.

43:52.062 --> 43:53.757
I fell in love with her twice.

43:53.831 --> 43:55.594
I thought she could do the same.

43:55.666 --> 43:59.227
We were the same two people
on the same ship.

43:59.303 --> 44:01.066
Why didn't it happen again?

44:01.171 --> 44:04.140
I keep going over and over
our last conversation,

44:04.174 --> 44:05.573
trying to think
if there was

44:05.643 --> 44:09.477
something I could have said,
could have done...

44:09.546 --> 44:12.276
but nothing comes to mind.

44:12.349 --> 44:15.682
Commander, I don't think
you can analyze love.

44:15.753 --> 44:19.245
It's the greatest mystery
of all.

44:19.323 --> 44:22.690
No one knows why it
happens or doesn't.

44:22.760 --> 44:25.524
Love is a chance
combination of elements.

44:25.596 --> 44:28.929
Any one thing might be enough
to keep it from igniting--

44:28.999 --> 44:30.796
a mood, a glance...

44:30.868 --> 44:33.928
a remark.

44:34.004 --> 44:37.337
And if we could define love...

44:37.408 --> 44:40.275
predict it...

44:40.344 --> 44:42.608
it would probably lose
its power.

44:44.615 --> 44:46.913
I'll let you finish.

44:50.120 --> 44:51.485
Good night.
