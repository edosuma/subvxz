02:53.556 --> 02:55.706
My poor boy.

04:37.894 --> 04:40.530
Look here, love.

04:40.630 --> 04:42.599
This ring was my mother's.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.933
Take it, heart.

04:49.072 --> 04:52.509
But keep it till you woo another wife,
when Imogen is dead.

04:52.609 --> 04:54.377
How?

04:54.477 --> 04:57.547
How another? Give me but this.

04:57.647 --> 04:59.670
I have.

05:01.017 --> 05:03.119
Remain.

05:03.219 --> 05:06.654
Remain thou here,
while sense can keep it on.

05:08.491 --> 05:10.579
For my sake...

05:13.363 --> 05:15.198
wear this.

05:32.847 --> 05:36.684
Thou basest thing,
avoid hence, from my sight.

05:47.096 --> 05:50.100
If after this command thou fraught
the court with thy unworthiness,

05:51.573 --> 05:53.801
thou diest.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.804
Away.

05:58.174 --> 06:00.441
Thou art poison to my blood.

06:10.920 --> 06:14.357
Disloyal thing
that shouldst repair my youth,

06:15.460 --> 06:18.426
thou heapst a year's age on me.

06:22.465 --> 06:25.501
- I chose an eagle.
- Thou took'st a beggar,

06:25.601 --> 06:28.338
wouldst have made my throne
a seat of baseness.

06:28.438 --> 06:31.946
It is your fault
that I have loved Posthumus.

06:32.046 --> 06:34.877
You bred him as my playfellow.

06:34.977 --> 06:37.447
What, art thou mad?

06:41.484 --> 06:43.284
Almost.

06:49.159 --> 06:52.058
Thou foolish thing.

07:15.384 --> 07:18.121
They were again together.

07:18.221 --> 07:21.457
You have not done after our command.

07:21.557 --> 07:24.765
Away with her and pen her up.

07:26.929 --> 07:29.592
Leave us to ourselves,

07:30.733 --> 07:33.259
and make yourself some comfort

07:33.359 --> 07:35.763
out of your best advice.

07:37.940 --> 07:41.311
Let her languish a drop of blood a day,

07:41.411 --> 07:46.181
and, being aged, die of this folly.

08:13.175 --> 08:14.937
No,

08:15.037 --> 08:18.254
be assured you shall not find me,

08:18.354 --> 08:23.362
after the slander of most stepmothers,
evil-eyed unto you.

08:24.687 --> 08:27.023
You are my prisoner,

08:27.123 --> 08:31.492
but the jailer
shall deliver you the key.

09:03.493 --> 09:07.897
That she should love
this fellow and refuse me.

09:08.297 --> 09:10.634
She is damned.

09:11.234 --> 09:15.603
Her brains and her beauty
go not together.

09:21.144 --> 09:24.267
She shines not upon fools.

09:57.313 --> 10:00.863
He hath been your faithful servant.

10:01.817 --> 10:05.286
I dare lay my honor he will remain so.

11:03.179 --> 11:05.218
I beseech you,

11:05.649 --> 11:09.152
be better known to this gentleman, whom
I commend to you as a noble friend of mine.

11:09.252 --> 11:14.090
- His father and I were soldiers together.
- Sir, we have known each other in Orleans.

11:14.190 --> 11:17.393
By your pardon,
I was then a young traveler.

11:17.793 --> 11:22.365
But upon my mended judgment,
if I offend not to say it is mended,

11:22.465 --> 11:25.801
my quarrel was not altogether slight.

11:25.901 --> 11:28.738
Can we with manners
ask what was the difference?

11:28.838 --> 11:31.707
Safely, I think.
It was a contention in public.

11:31.907 --> 11:35.811
Where each of us fell in praise
of our country mistresses,

11:35.911 --> 11:38.181
this gentlemen at that time vouching...

11:38.281 --> 11:41.167
And upon warrant
of bloody affirmation...

11:41.267 --> 11:45.154
His to be more fair, virtuous, wise,

11:45.254 --> 11:48.616
chaste, constant, qualified, and...

11:48.716 --> 11:51.861
less attemptable than any
of the rarest of the ladies in France.

11:51.961 --> 11:56.132
That lady is not now living,
or that gentleman's opinion by this worn out.

11:56.232 --> 11:59.869
She holds her virtue still,
and I my mind.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.838
If she went before others I have seen,

12:01.938 --> 12:05.875
as that diamond of yours outlusters
many I have beheld,

12:05.975 --> 12:08.911
I could not but believe
she excelled many.

12:09.011 --> 12:13.165
But I have not seen the most precious
diamond that is, nor you the lady.

12:13.265 --> 12:15.999
I praised her as I rated her.
So do I my stone.

12:16.099 --> 12:17.720
What do you esteem it at?

12:19.739 --> 12:21.572
More than the world enjoys.

12:23.045 --> 12:27.163
Your mistress is now either dead
or out-prized by a trifle.

12:28.405 --> 12:31.200
You are mistaken.

12:31.300 --> 12:33.603
The ring may be sold or given.

12:33.703 --> 12:37.873
The other is not a thing for sale,
and only a gift of the gods.

12:42.482 --> 12:44.614
Which the gods have given you?

12:44.714 --> 12:47.450
Which, by their graces, I will keep.

12:47.550 --> 12:49.219
You may wear her in title yours,

12:49.319 --> 12:52.855
but you know strange fowl
light on neighboring ponds.

12:52.955 --> 12:55.725
Let us leave here, gentleman.

12:56.125 --> 12:57.994
No, no, no.

12:58.094 --> 13:00.463
I dare pawn my estate to your ring,

13:00.563 --> 13:03.015
which in my opinion
overvalues it something.

13:03.115 --> 13:07.046
But I make my wager rather
against your confidence

13:07.146 --> 13:09.503
than her reputation.

13:11.674 --> 13:13.576
What lady would you choose to assail?

13:13.676 --> 13:18.080
Yours, whom in constancy
you think so safe.

13:18.180 --> 13:22.018
I lay ten thousand to your ring

13:22.118 --> 13:25.621
that, commend me to the court
where your lady is,

13:25.721 --> 13:28.908
with no more advantage than opportunity
for a second conference,

13:29.008 --> 13:33.429
and I will take that honor of hers
from thence which you imagine so reserved.

13:35.915 --> 13:39.985
Even if you buy ladies' flesh
at a million a dram,

13:40.085 --> 13:43.254
you cannot prevent it from tainting.

13:45.758 --> 13:48.828
I dare you to this match.
Here is my ring.

13:48.928 --> 13:52.832
If I bring you no sufficient testimony
that I have enjoyed

13:52.932 --> 13:57.203
the dearest bodily part
of your mistress,

13:57.303 --> 14:00.973
my ten thousand are yours,
and so your ring.

14:02.134 --> 14:04.243
Enough of this.
Let it die as it were born.

14:04.343 --> 14:08.647
I embrace these conditions.
Let us have articles betwixt us.

14:12.952 --> 14:16.150
If you make your voyage upon her
and give to me directly

14:16.250 --> 14:19.735
you have prevailed,
I am no further your enemy.

14:19.835 --> 14:21.327
She is not worth the debate.

14:21.427 --> 14:25.898
If she remains unseduced,
for your ill opinion

14:25.998 --> 14:28.706
and the assault you have made
to her chastity...

14:34.807 --> 14:37.347
You will answer my sword.

14:41.180 --> 14:43.196
Your hand,

14:44.078 --> 14:45.096
a covenant.

15:02.468 --> 15:04.835
Master doctor.

15:06.272 --> 15:09.709
Have you brought those drugs?

15:10.009 --> 15:12.576
Pleaseth your highness, ay.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.821
Here they are, madam.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.048
But I beseech your grace,

15:32.548 --> 15:35.544
my conscience bids me ask,

15:35.644 --> 15:41.273
wherefore you have commanded of me
these most poisonous compounds,

15:41.373 --> 15:43.879
which are the movers
of a languishing death,

15:44.109 --> 15:46.212
but though slow, deadly.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.514
I will test the forces
of these thy compounds

15:48.614 --> 15:54.386
on such creatures as we count not
worth the hanging, but none human.

16:07.699 --> 16:11.101
No further service, doctor,
until I send for thee.

16:23.682 --> 16:25.749
Good morrow to your majesty.

16:49.241 --> 16:51.074
Ambassador's from Rome.

16:53.212 --> 16:57.016
Caius Lucius. A most worthy fellow.

16:57.732 --> 17:01.387
Albeit he comes on angry purpose now.

17:01.487 --> 17:03.522
But that's no fault of his.

17:03.622 --> 17:08.025
We must receive him according
to the honor of his sender.

17:14.098 --> 17:17.734
Our dear son, we will have need
to employ you towards this Roman.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.520
Why should we pay tribute?

17:34.620 --> 17:38.491
If Caesar can hide the sun
from us with a blanket

17:38.591 --> 17:41.226
or put the moon in his pocket,

17:41.326 --> 17:43.562
we will pay him tribute for light.

17:43.662 --> 17:47.097
Else, sir, no more tribute.

17:54.039 --> 17:58.381
You must know, till the injurious Romans
did extort this tribute from us,

17:58.481 --> 18:00.713
we were free.

18:00.813 --> 18:05.351
Caesar's ambition, which swelled so much
it almost stretched the sides of the world,

18:05.451 --> 18:07.953
against all color here
did put the yoke upon us,

18:08.053 --> 18:11.623
which to shake off
becomes a warlike people.

18:11.723 --> 18:15.025
Whom we reckon ourselves to be.

18:17.963 --> 18:20.332
I am sorry, Cymbeline,
that I am to pronounce

18:20.432 --> 18:23.902
Augustus Caesar thine enemy.

18:24.002 --> 18:27.907
Our subjects, sir,
will not endure his yoke,

18:28.007 --> 18:31.124
and for ourself to show
less sovereignty than they

18:31.224 --> 18:34.478
must needs appear un-kinglike.

18:37.382 --> 18:41.587
Receive it from me, then:
War and confusion.

18:41.687 --> 18:44.857
Fury not to be resisted.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.960
The event is yet to name the winner.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.764
Fare thee well.

18:56.034 --> 19:00.103
We will nothing pay
for wearing our noses.

19:13.018 --> 19:15.521
He goes hence frowning,

19:15.621 --> 19:20.090
but it honors us
that we have given him cause.

20:44.643 --> 20:47.713
<i>O, that husband,</i>

20:48.682 --> 20:51.915
<i>my supreme crown of grief.</i>

21:15.707 --> 21:20.610
<i>A noble gentleman of Rome
comes from my Lord with letters.</i>

21:28.120 --> 21:30.990
The worthy Posthumus is in safety

21:31.090 --> 21:34.057
and greets your highness dearly.

21:35.027 --> 21:37.596
Thanks, good sir.

21:38.096 --> 21:40.663
You're kindly welcome.

21:55.681 --> 21:59.051
- His health, beseech you?
- Well, madam.

21:59.351 --> 22:01.921
Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.

22:02.021 --> 22:06.525
There's none a stranger there
so merry and so gamesome.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.026
He is called the reveler.

22:08.126 --> 22:11.463
When he was here
he did incline to sadness,

22:11.563 --> 22:13.897
and ofttimes not knowing why.

22:16.301 --> 22:17.606
I never saw him sad.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.009
You look on me.

22:24.609 --> 22:27.656
What wrack discern you
in me deserves your pity?

22:31.577 --> 22:33.557
Lamentable.

22:34.820 --> 22:37.268
Why do you pity me?

22:37.368 --> 22:39.922
That others do.

22:40.022 --> 22:43.260
I was about to say, enjoy...

22:44.830 --> 22:47.699
but it is an office of the gods
to avenge it, not mine to speak on it.

22:47.799 --> 22:50.802
You do seem to know something of me,

22:50.902 --> 22:53.972
or what concerns me.

22:54.072 --> 22:56.375
Pray you, since fearing things go ill

22:56.475 --> 23:00.112
often hurts more
than to be sure they do,

23:00.212 --> 23:03.115
for certainties are either
past remedies or timely knowing,

23:03.215 --> 23:05.150
the remedy then born, just...

23:05.250 --> 23:09.786
discover to me
what you both spur and stop.

23:17.896 --> 23:21.700
Had I this cheek to bathe my lips upon;

23:21.800 --> 23:24.136
This hand, whose touch,
whose every touch,

23:24.236 --> 23:26.672
Would force the feeler's soul
to the oath of loyalty;

23:26.772 --> 23:30.542
this object which takes prisoner
the wild motions of mine eye,

23:30.642 --> 23:33.912
and fixes it only here,
should I, damned then,

23:34.012 --> 23:39.484
slaver with lips as common as stairs
that mount the capital,

23:39.584 --> 23:42.087
it were fit all the plagues of hell

23:42.187 --> 23:44.790
should at one time
encounter such revolt.

23:44.890 --> 23:50.462
O dearest soul, thy cause doth strike
my heart with a pity that makes me sick.

23:50.562 --> 23:53.065
A lady, so fair,
and fastened to an empery

23:53.165 --> 23:55.634
that would the greatest king double,

23:55.734 --> 23:59.469
to be partnered with... with tomboys...

24:04.676 --> 24:07.060
diseased ventures

24:07.160 --> 24:11.783
and such boiled stuff
as might well poison poison.

24:12.183 --> 24:14.686
Be revenged,

24:14.786 --> 24:16.755
or she that bore you was no queen,

24:16.855 --> 24:20.377
and you recoil from your great stock.

24:23.428 --> 24:25.501
Revenged?

24:26.631 --> 24:28.834
How should I be revenged?

24:28.934 --> 24:31.353
If this be true,
how should I be revenged?

24:31.453 --> 24:35.340
I dedicate myself
to your sweet pleasure.

24:35.440 --> 24:38.477
More noble than that renegade
from your bed.

24:38.577 --> 24:43.582
And will continue fast to your affection
still close as sure.

24:43.682 --> 24:47.652
Let me my service tender

24:47.752 --> 24:50.019
on your lips.

25:09.541 --> 25:13.576
I do condemn mine ears
that hath attended thee so long.

25:16.581 --> 25:18.651
Pisanio.

25:19.451 --> 25:21.987
The king my father shall be
made acquainted of thy assault.

25:22.087 --> 25:25.657
And if he shall think it fit
a saucy stranger in his court

25:25.757 --> 25:30.036
to expound his beastly mind to us,
then he hath a court he little cares for

25:30.136 --> 25:32.562
and a daughter
who he not respects at all.

25:37.469 --> 25:38.603
Give me your pardon.

25:38.903 --> 25:42.374
I... I spoke this to know

25:42.474 --> 25:45.310
if your affiance were deeply rooted,

25:45.410 --> 25:49.248
and shall make your Lord
that which he is, new o'er.

25:50.351 --> 25:52.397
He is...

25:52.497 --> 25:56.049
one of the truest mannered, he...

25:56.588 --> 25:59.491
Such a holy witch

26:00.091 --> 26:02.728
as might enchants societies unto him.

26:02.828 --> 26:04.696
Half all men's hearts are his.

26:06.316 --> 26:09.634
He sits among men like a descended God.

26:09.734 --> 26:13.872
He hath a... a kind of honor about him,

26:13.972 --> 26:18.243
sets him off more than a mortal seeming.

26:18.343 --> 26:21.380
Be not angry, most mighty princess,

26:21.480 --> 26:25.851
that I have adventured
your taking of a false report.

26:25.951 --> 26:29.020
The love I bear him

26:29.120 --> 26:31.921
made me to fan you thus.

26:50.776 --> 26:53.678
But the gods made you,
unlike all the others.

26:54.078 --> 26:57.549
Pray, your pardon.

26:58.580 --> 27:00.217
All's well, sir.

27:05.223 --> 27:08.291
Take my power in the court of yours.

27:15.314 --> 27:17.770
I had but...

27:18.370 --> 27:20.439
I almost forgot...

27:21.139 --> 27:23.202
What is it?

27:23.702 --> 27:28.213
Some dozen of us and your Lord,
the best feather in our wing,

27:28.313 --> 27:30.649
have mingled sums to buy a present.

27:30.749 --> 27:34.953
And I am somewhat curious
to have safe storage.

27:35.053 --> 27:37.656
May it please you
to take it in protection?

27:37.756 --> 27:40.113
For this night only.
I must aboard tomorrow.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.126
Willingly.

27:57.842 --> 28:03.515
<i>Oh, the gentlemen are talking</i>

28:03.615 --> 28:09.321
<i>And the midnight moon
is on the riverside</i>

28:09.421 --> 28:11.923
<i>They're drinking up</i>

28:12.023 --> 28:15.318
<i>And walking</i>

28:15.418 --> 28:17.896
<i>And it is time</i>

28:17.996 --> 28:21.102
<i>For me to slide</i>

28:21.632 --> 28:27.238
<i>I live in another world</i>

28:27.338 --> 28:33.311
<i>Where life and death are memorized</i>

28:33.411 --> 28:35.814
<i>Where the earth is strung</i>

28:35.914 --> 28:38.850
<i>With lovers' pearls</i>

28:39.250 --> 28:41.686
<i>And all I see</i>

28:41.786 --> 28:44.821
<i>Are dark eyes</i>

28:49.361 --> 28:52.298
I do not like her.

28:53.665 --> 28:57.736
She doth think she has strange,

28:57.836 --> 29:01.573
lingering poisons.

29:01.673 --> 29:06.277
I do know her spirit, and will not trust

29:06.377 --> 29:08.913
one of her malice.

29:12.517 --> 29:15.720
With a drug of such damned nature.

29:20.459 --> 29:23.628
<i>But I feel nothing</i>

29:23.728 --> 29:25.897
<i>For their game</i>

29:26.397 --> 29:32.070
<i>Where beauty goes unrecognized</i>

29:32.670 --> 29:38.409
<i>All I feel is heat and flame</i>

29:38.509 --> 29:40.912
<i>And all I see</i>

29:41.012 --> 29:46.084
<i>Are dark eyes</i>

29:56.061 --> 30:01.800
<i>The French girl, she's in paradise</i>

30:01.900 --> 30:07.572
<i>And a drunken man is at the wheel</i>

30:08.172 --> 30:10.608
<i>Hunger pays</i>

30:10.708 --> 30:13.612
<i>A heavy price</i>

30:14.012 --> 30:16.648
<i>To the fallen gods</i>

30:16.748 --> 30:20.218
<i>Of speed and steel</i>

30:20.318 --> 30:22.954
<i>The time is short</i>

30:23.054 --> 30:26.091
<i>And the days are sweet</i>

30:26.291 --> 30:28.927
<i>And passion rules</i>

30:29.027 --> 30:32.397
<i>The arrow that flies</i>

30:32.497 --> 30:35.934
<i>A million faces</i>

30:36.034 --> 30:38.470
<i>At my feet</i>

30:38.570 --> 30:41.240
<i>But all I see</i>

30:41.340 --> 30:45.076
<i>Are dark</i>

30:45.176 --> 30:47.910
<i>Eyes</i>

31:45.470 --> 31:47.572
<i>The crickets sing,</i>

31:47.672 --> 31:50.909
<i>and man's over-labored sense</i>

31:51.009 --> 31:54.513
<i>repairs itself by rest.</i>

31:54.613 --> 31:57.148
<i>Our tarquin thus</i>

31:57.248 --> 32:00.864
<i>did softly press the rushes,
ere he wakened</i>

32:00.964 --> 32:04.020
<i>the chastity he wounded.</i>

32:05.957 --> 32:10.929
<i>How bravely thou becomest
thy bed, fresh lily,</i>

32:11.029 --> 32:15.667
<i>and whiter than the sheets,</i>
<i>that I might touch.</i>

32:20.338 --> 32:24.673
<i>But kiss; one kiss.</i>

32:57.542 --> 32:58.510
<i>Mmm...</i>

32:58.610 --> 33:01.279
<i>But my design,</i>

33:01.379 --> 33:04.813
<i>come off... come off...</i>

33:24.469 --> 33:27.572
<i>On her left breast,
a mole cinque-spotted,</i>

33:27.672 --> 33:32.577
<i>like the crimson drops
in the bottom of a cowslip:</i>

33:32.677 --> 33:35.447
<i>Here's a voucher,
stronger than ever law could make:</i>

33:35.547 --> 33:38.783
<i>This secret will force him
think I have pick'd the lock</i>

33:38.883 --> 33:41.617
<i>and taken the treasure.</i>

33:42.854 --> 33:45.289
<i>No more.</i>

33:45.389 --> 33:47.723
<i>To what end?</i>

33:48.926 --> 33:51.329
<i>I have enough.</i>

33:51.429 --> 33:54.065
<i>I live in fear.</i>

33:54.165 --> 33:57.433
<i>Though this a heavenly angel...</i>

33:59.537 --> 34:01.570
<i>Hell is here.</i>

34:20.858 --> 34:23.895
I do think I saw it this morning.

34:23.995 --> 34:26.364
Confident I am.

34:26.464 --> 34:29.067
Last night 'twas on mine arm.
I kissed it.

34:29.167 --> 34:31.768
Twill not be lost.

34:31.869 --> 34:36.074
Good morrow, fairest...

34:36.474 --> 34:39.375
Sister. Your sweet hand.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.681
Still I swear I love you.

34:43.781 --> 34:46.717
I pray you, spare me.

34:46.818 --> 34:50.987
I will unfold equal discourtesy
to your best kindness.

34:52.156 --> 34:56.025
- To leave you in your madness 'twere my sin.
- Stop!

34:56.194 --> 34:58.196
I shall not.

34:58.596 --> 35:02.064
Fools cure not mad folks.

35:34.699 --> 35:38.567
Your lady is one of the fairest
I have looked upon.

35:41.539 --> 35:42.505
For you.

35:44.175 --> 35:46.010
Was caius Lucius in the court
when you were there?

35:46.110 --> 35:49.514
He was expected, but not approached.

35:49.914 --> 35:52.884
I'll make a journey twice as far
to enjoy a second night

35:52.984 --> 35:55.852
of such sweet shortness which was mine.

35:59.390 --> 36:03.061
For the ring is won.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.796
Your lady being so easy.

36:05.496 --> 36:08.800
If you can make it apparent

36:08.900 --> 36:11.870
that you have tasted her in bed,

36:12.270 --> 36:15.173
my hand and ring are yours.

36:15.273 --> 36:18.143
If not, the foul opinion
you had of her pure honor

36:18.243 --> 36:20.879
gains or loses, your sword or mine.

36:20.979 --> 36:23.148
First, her bedchamber,

36:23.248 --> 36:26.484
where I confess I slept not,

36:26.584 --> 36:30.275
but profess had that...

36:30.375 --> 36:33.254
which was well worth watching.

36:43.768 --> 36:45.770
Let it be granted
you have seen all this,

36:45.870 --> 36:50.108
the description of what is in her chamber
nothing saves the wager you have laid.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.743
See.

36:56.714 --> 36:58.750
This must be married to your diamond.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.352
Let me behold it.

37:01.452 --> 37:03.054
Is it that which I left with her?

37:04.110 --> 37:08.424
She gave it me,
she said she prized it once.

37:12.630 --> 37:14.932
Maybe she plucked it off to send to me.

37:17.401 --> 37:19.368
She writes you so, doth she?

37:29.247 --> 37:31.079
No.

37:35.820 --> 37:37.820
'Tis true.

37:41.959 --> 37:43.795
Here.

37:44.495 --> 37:48.197
Take this too.
It kills me to look on it.

37:49.800 --> 37:52.108
Let there be no...

37:52.424 --> 37:54.543
honor

37:54.643 --> 37:57.308
where semblance, truth,

37:57.408 --> 37:59.143
where beauty, love,

37:59.243 --> 38:02.580
where there's another man.
The vows of women...

38:03.271 --> 38:06.648
Take your ring again.

38:07.618 --> 38:09.920
'Tis not yet won.

38:10.020 --> 38:12.923
It may be probable that she has lost it

38:13.023 --> 38:14.970
or, who knows,

38:15.070 --> 38:18.830
if one of her women, being corrupted,
hath stolen it from her.

38:18.930 --> 38:21.229
It's very true.

38:22.934 --> 38:25.467
She would not lose it.

38:27.104 --> 38:29.273
All of her attendants
are sworn and honorable.

38:29.373 --> 38:31.242
They induced to steal it,
and by a stranger?

38:32.042 --> 38:33.537
No!

38:35.046 --> 38:38.746
He hath enjoyed her. She hath bought
the name of whore thus dearly.

38:39.592 --> 38:42.916
If you desire further satisfaction,

38:43.821 --> 38:47.758
under her breast, worthy the pressing,

38:47.858 --> 38:51.496
lies there a mole, right proud
of that most delicate lodging.

38:51.596 --> 38:54.665
By my life I swear...

38:54.765 --> 38:57.101
I kissed it,

38:57.201 --> 39:01.637
and though full it gave me
present hunger to feed again.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.408
Do you do remember this stain upon her?

39:04.508 --> 39:06.375
Ay.

39:09.447 --> 39:12.250
And it doth confirm another stain

39:12.350 --> 39:15.217
- as big as hell can hold.
- Shall you hear more?

39:22.426 --> 39:24.418
O,

39:25.051 --> 39:29.765
that I had her here,
to tear her limbmeal.

39:31.969 --> 39:35.771
I will go there, then do it
in the court before her father!

40:11.242 --> 40:12.775
From Posthumus.

40:19.450 --> 40:23.354
"Justice and your father's wrath,
should he take me in his dominion,

40:23.454 --> 40:28.359
could not be so cruel to me as you,
o dearest of creatures,

40:28.459 --> 40:31.730
would even renew me with your eyes.

40:32.130 --> 40:35.366
Take notice that I am at Milford Haven.

40:35.466 --> 40:39.337
What your own love will out
of this advise you, follow.

40:39.437 --> 40:42.640
So he wishes you all happiness,
that remains loyal to his vow,

40:42.740 --> 40:45.490
and your increasing love."

40:48.879 --> 40:51.699
O, for a horse with wings!

40:53.017 --> 40:56.382
Hear'st thou? He is at Milford Haven.

41:03.361 --> 41:07.031
Read, and tell me how far it is.

41:07.531 --> 41:10.701
And how may we steal from hence,
and for the gap and our return, to excuse.

41:10.801 --> 41:13.602
But first, how get hence?

41:16.140 --> 41:17.625
Speak. How many miles?

41:17.725 --> 41:20.641
Twenty miles 'twixt sun and sun, madam.

41:20.741 --> 41:23.145
It's enough for you and too much too.

41:31.021 --> 41:34.725
We have seen nothing; we are beastly.

41:34.825 --> 41:37.426
How you speak.

41:43.367 --> 41:47.471
O boys, this story the world
may read in me:

41:47.571 --> 41:50.872
My body's marked with Roman swords.

41:52.410 --> 41:56.478
My report was once first
with the best of note:

41:58.282 --> 42:01.182
Cymbeline loved me,

42:01.852 --> 42:03.487
and when a soldier was the theme,

42:03.587 --> 42:07.323
my name was not far off:
Then was I as a tree.

42:15.766 --> 42:21.072
<i>Villains, whose false oaths prevailed
before my perfect honor,</i>

42:21.172 --> 42:26.010
<i>swore to Cymbeline
I was confederate with the Romans:</i>

42:26.110 --> 42:31.549
<i>O Cymbeline! Heaven and my conscience
knows thou didst unjustly banish me:</i>

42:31.649 --> 42:36.020
<i>Whereon, at three and two years old,
I stole these boys.</i>

42:36.120 --> 42:39.824
<i>And this twenty years
this rock has been my world;</i>

42:39.924 --> 42:44.228
<i>Where I have lived at honest freedom,
paid more pious debts to heaven</i>

42:44.328 --> 42:48.032
<i>than in all the fore-end of my time.</i>

42:49.656 --> 42:53.037
<i>These boys know little
they are sons to the king;</i>

42:53.137 --> 42:56.774
<i>nor Cymbeline dreams
that they are alive.</i>

42:56.874 --> 43:01.245
<i>They think they are mine;
and though trained up thus meanly</i>

43:01.345 --> 43:05.481
<i>their thoughts do hit
the roofs of palaces.</i>

43:17.995 --> 43:21.332
<i>O, vengeance, vengeance.</i>

43:21.432 --> 43:24.966
<i>Could I find out
the woman's part in me...</i>

43:26.270 --> 43:28.372
<i>for there's no motion
that tends to vice in man,</i>

43:28.472 --> 43:30.539
<i>but I affirm it is the woman's part.</i>

43:41.885 --> 43:44.988
<i>Be it lying, note it,</i>

43:45.088 --> 43:49.059
<i>the woman's; fattering, hers;</i>

43:49.159 --> 43:50.761
<i>deceiving, hers;</i>

43:50.861 --> 43:56.642
<i>lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers;</i>

43:56.742 --> 43:59.835
<i>revenges, hers.</i>

44:01.238 --> 44:04.609
<i>Ambitions, covetings,</i>

44:05.209 --> 44:09.330
<i>change of prides, disdain,</i>

44:09.430 --> 44:12.350
<i>slanders, mutability.</i>

44:12.450 --> 44:15.851
<i>All faults that have a name, hers.</i>

44:16.987 --> 44:19.122
<i>Detest them,</i>

44:19.222 --> 44:21.289
<i>curse them.</i>

44:22.893 --> 44:24.960
Where is Posthumus?

44:29.499 --> 44:33.368
What is in thy mind,
that thee stare thus?

44:44.948 --> 44:48.752
<i>"Thy mistress hath played
the strumpet in my bed...</i>

44:48.852 --> 44:51.789
<i>The testimonies whereof
lie bleeding in me.</i>

44:51.889 --> 44:56.149
<i>I speak not out of weak surmise
but from proof as strong as my grief</i>

44:56.249 --> 44:59.163
<i>and as certain as I expect my revenge.</i>

44:59.263 --> 45:02.366
<i>That part, thou, Pisanio,</i>

45:02.466 --> 45:04.966
<i>you must act for me."</i>

45:09.373 --> 45:13.143
"If thy faith be not tainted
with the breach of hers,

45:13.243 --> 45:17.448
let thine own hand take away her life.

45:18.148 --> 45:22.620
If thou fear to strike
and to make me certain it is done,

45:22.720 --> 45:27.956
thou art the pander to her dishonor
and equally to me disloyal."

45:39.403 --> 45:42.204
False to his bed?

45:45.175 --> 45:48.376
What is it to be false?

45:52.049 --> 45:55.119
To lie there in watch
and to think on him?

45:55.219 --> 45:58.189
No, no. No, no. On my life.

45:58.289 --> 46:01.191
Where's thy knife? Where?!

46:01.291 --> 46:06.094
Thou art too slow to do
thy master's bidding when I desire it too.

46:16.073 --> 46:19.276
Since I received command
to do this business,

46:19.376 --> 46:22.310
I have not slept one wink.

46:23.681 --> 46:27.444
Well, do it, and to bed, then.

46:28.886 --> 46:31.188
I'll wake mine eyeballs blind first.

46:32.297 --> 46:34.325
Why?

46:34.425 --> 46:37.728
Why has thou abused
so many miles with a pretense?

46:37.828 --> 46:41.799
This place? Bring me here to kill me?

46:41.899 --> 46:43.334
But to win time.

46:43.434 --> 46:48.138
I have considered a course.
Hear me. Hear me with patience.

46:48.538 --> 46:50.841
It cannot be
but that my master is abused.

46:50.941 --> 46:53.711
Some villain, ay,
and singular in his art,

46:53.811 --> 46:58.282
hath done you both
this... this cursed injury.

46:58.382 --> 47:01.251
I'll give but notice you are dead,

47:01.351 --> 47:05.155
and send him some bloody sign of it,
for 'tis commanded I should do so.

47:06.020 --> 47:09.093
You shall be missed at court,

47:09.593 --> 47:12.127
and that will well confirm it.

47:14.832 --> 47:17.067
Now, here's the point:

47:17.167 --> 47:20.604
If you could wear a mind
dark as your fortune is,

47:20.704 --> 47:23.217
forget to be a woman.

47:27.144 --> 47:28.377
Change.

47:41.258 --> 47:44.092
I see into thy end...

47:46.129 --> 47:49.197
And am almost a man already.

48:23.984 --> 48:25.881
This attempt...

48:25.981 --> 48:28.878
I am soldier to,

48:29.639 --> 48:32.874
and will abide it
with a prince's courage.

48:52.362 --> 48:55.099
From the queen. What's in't is precious.

48:55.199 --> 48:58.233
A dram of this
will drive away distemper.

49:00.037 --> 49:02.773
We must take a short farewell
lest being missed,

49:02.873 --> 49:05.209
I be suspected of your carriage
from the court.

49:05.309 --> 49:08.143
Away, I prithee.

49:36.473 --> 49:37.768
Where is our daughter?

49:53.891 --> 49:56.393
Call her before us.

49:57.294 --> 50:01.999
Since the exile of Posthumus,
most retired hath her life been,

50:02.099 --> 50:05.701
the cure whereof, my Lord,
'tis time must do.

50:08.071 --> 50:10.605
Where is she?

50:13.110 --> 50:15.646
How can her contempt be answered?

50:15.746 --> 50:18.949
That man of hers, Pisanio,
her old servant,

50:19.049 --> 50:21.616
I have not seen these two days.

50:25.322 --> 50:27.843
Go, look after.

50:53.417 --> 50:55.485
Pisanio!

50:55.585 --> 50:59.154
Come hither! Villain.

51:03.293 --> 51:07.370
She said upon a time

51:08.398 --> 51:12.900
the bitterness of it
I now belch from my heart...

51:14.237 --> 51:16.955
That she held the very...

51:17.055 --> 51:20.377
garment of Posthumus

51:20.477 --> 51:22.907
in more respect

51:23.007 --> 51:25.749
than my noble

51:25.849 --> 51:28.783
and natural person.

51:49.539 --> 51:51.873
Where is she?

51:53.977 --> 51:55.562
I will not ask again.

52:01.184 --> 52:04.187
This is the history of my knowledge
touching her flight.

52:04.287 --> 52:07.622
Is she with Posthumus?

52:09.126 --> 52:11.492
As I think.

52:14.331 --> 52:18.366
How long is't she went to Milford Haven?

52:20.837 --> 52:23.907
She can scarce be there yet.

52:24.007 --> 52:26.143
Give me thy hand.

52:26.243 --> 52:31.279
Hast any of thy master's garments
in thy possession?

52:34.384 --> 52:37.387
The same suit he wore
when he took leave.

52:37.487 --> 52:39.657
Fetch that suit hither.

52:39.757 --> 52:43.258
Be a voluntary mute to my design.

52:48.598 --> 52:50.431
Go.

53:30.740 --> 53:34.108
With the suit upon my back,

53:35.712 --> 53:38.279
I will ravish her.

53:39.749 --> 53:43.887
First, kill Posthumus,

53:43.987 --> 53:46.757
and in her eyes.

53:47.057 --> 53:53.430
There shall she see my valor,
which will then be a torment

53:53.740 --> 53:56.264
to her contempt.

54:09.479 --> 54:12.015
<i>He on the ground,</i>

54:12.115 --> 54:14.584
<i>my speech an insultment</i>

54:14.684 --> 54:17.387
<i>ended on his dead body,</i>

54:17.487 --> 54:20.624
<i>and once my lust hath dined,</i>

54:20.724 --> 54:22.859
<i>which as I say to vex her</i>

54:22.959 --> 54:27.397
<i>I will execute in the clothes
that she so praised.</i>

54:27.497 --> 54:30.732
<i>To the court I'll knock her back.</i>

55:20.784 --> 55:22.317
Who's there?

56:15.972 --> 56:19.576
An angel here. No elder than a boy.

56:19.676 --> 56:22.465
Good masters, harm me not.

56:23.746 --> 56:28.585
Before I entered here, I thought
to have begged or bought what I took.

56:28.685 --> 56:30.920
Here's money.

56:31.020 --> 56:33.223
I would have left it on the board
as soon as I had made my meal

56:33.323 --> 56:37.559
and parted with prayers
for the provider.

56:39.329 --> 56:41.162
Money?

56:43.099 --> 56:45.769
All gold and silver rather turn to dirt.

56:45.869 --> 56:50.237
As 'tis no better reckoned
but of those who worship dirty gods.

56:53.710 --> 56:56.778
- I see you're angry.
- What's your name?

57:11.427 --> 57:13.797
Fidel, sir.

57:14.197 --> 57:16.075
Wither Bound?

57:16.175 --> 57:17.968
To Milford Haven.

57:18.068 --> 57:19.926
'Tis almost night.

57:20.026 --> 57:24.810
You shall have better cheer ere you depart,
and thanks to sit and eat.

57:25.610 --> 57:28.709
Boys, bid him welcome.

57:37.887 --> 57:39.235
I'll love him as a brother.

57:59.542 --> 58:03.080
<i>Mmm, mmm</i>

58:03.180 --> 58:05.915
<i>Mmm, yeah</i>

58:06.015 --> 58:07.985
<i>Mmm, mmm, mmm</i>

58:08.085 --> 58:09.619
<i>Mmm, mmm</i>

58:09.719 --> 58:12.422
<i>Mmm, mmm, yeah</i>

58:12.522 --> 58:15.625
<i>It is you</i>

58:15.725 --> 58:18.928
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

58:19.028 --> 58:22.165
<i>It is you, you</i>

58:22.265 --> 58:25.468
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

58:25.568 --> 58:28.671
<i>It is you</i>

58:28.771 --> 58:31.841
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

58:31.941 --> 58:35.712
<i>I say pressure drop
oh, pressure, oh yeah</i>

58:35.812 --> 58:38.215
<i>Pressure gonna drop on you</i>

58:38.315 --> 58:42.218
<i>I say pressure drop
oh, pressure, oh yeah</i>

58:42.318 --> 58:44.721
<i>Pressure gonna drop on you</i>

58:44.821 --> 58:48.825
<i>I say when it drops
oh, you're gonna feel it</i>

58:48.925 --> 58:52.062
<i>Pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure</i>

58:52.162 --> 58:54.764
<i>Pressure drop oh, pressure</i>

58:54.864 --> 58:59.235
<i>Oh, yeah, it's gonna drop on you</i>

58:59.335 --> 59:01.838
<i>Yeah, yeah, pressure, pressure</i>

59:01.938 --> 59:05.041
<i>Pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure</i>

59:05.141 --> 59:08.311
<i>Pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure</i>

59:08.411 --> 59:11.581
<i>Pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure</i>

59:11.681 --> 59:14.818
<i>Pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure</i>

59:14.918 --> 59:17.254
<i>Pressure gonna drop on you</i>

59:17.354 --> 59:20.329
<i>Pressure, pressure, preassure,
pressure, pressure...</i>

59:24.561 --> 59:27.695
'Tis cloten, the son o' the queen.

59:34.203 --> 59:36.771
I fear some ambush.

59:54.357 --> 59:56.824
Posthumus...

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:07.418
What's thy name?

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:14.341
I am son to the queen.

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:22.986
I am sorry for it,

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:25.520
not seeming so worthy as thy birth.

01:00:32.028 --> 01:00:34.564
Art not afeard?

01:00:34.864 --> 01:00:39.135
Those that I reverence,
those I fear, the wise.

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:41.504
At fools I laugh, not fear them.

01:00:57.253 --> 01:00:59.122
Die thy death!

01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:22.445
<i>I am sick.</i>

01:01:22.645 --> 01:01:24.679
<i>Heartsick.</i>

01:01:28.384 --> 01:01:32.019
<i>Pisanio, I'll now taste of thy drug.</i>

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:04.554
What hast thou done?

01:02:09.659 --> 01:02:12.195
With his own sword
which he did wave against my throat,

01:02:12.295 --> 01:02:14.797
I have taken his head from him.

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:18.635
I'll throw it into the creek
behind our rock, and let it into the sea.

01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:22.303
And tell the fishes
he's the queen's son.

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:27.444
He must have some attendants.

01:02:27.544 --> 01:02:30.845
Well, 'tis done.

01:02:36.886 --> 01:02:41.889
I do fear this body hath a tail
more perilous than the head.

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:34.408
Fidel!

01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:49.292
Thou blessed thing.

01:03:49.858 --> 01:03:54.297
Jove knows what man
thou might'st have made.

01:03:54.697 --> 01:03:57.164
Why, he but sleeps.

01:03:59.736 --> 01:04:01.869
Let us bury him.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.059
<i>Fear no more</i>

01:04:06.159 --> 01:04:11.714
<i>The heat o' the sun</i>

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:14.317
<i>Nor the furious</i>

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:19.286
<i>Winter rages</i>

01:04:21.391 --> 01:04:25.061
<i>Thou thy worldly task</i>

01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:28.729
<i>Hast done</i>

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:32.268
<i>Home art gone</i>

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:37.438
<i>And ta'en thy wages</i>

01:04:39.242 --> 01:04:42.879
<i>Golden lads and girls</i>

01:04:42.979 --> 01:04:46.347
<i>All must</i>

01:04:47.683 --> 01:04:50.753
<i>As chimney sweepers</i>

01:04:50.853 --> 01:04:55.856
<i>Come to dust</i>

01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:06.736
Imogen.

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:11.407
The prized part of my comfort, gone,

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:14.577
my queen upon a desperate bed,

01:05:14.677 --> 01:05:18.445
and in a time
when fearful wars point on me.

01:05:30.859 --> 01:05:32.428
But for thee, fellow,

01:05:32.528 --> 01:05:36.431
who needs must know of her departure
and dost seem so ignorant.

01:05:57.887 --> 01:06:00.923
I beseech your highness,

01:06:01.403 --> 01:06:03.860
hold me your loyal servant.

01:06:04.984 --> 01:06:07.497
The day that she went missing,
he was here.

01:06:08.397 --> 01:06:14.569
I dare be bound he's true, and shall perform
all parts of his subjection loyally.

01:06:18.741 --> 01:06:21.542
The time is troublesome.

01:06:22.945 --> 01:06:24.879
We'll slip you for a second.

01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:32.219
But our jealousy does yet depend.

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:56.637
<i>I hope I dream.</i>

01:08:10.985 --> 01:08:13.854
The dream's here still.

01:08:17.026 --> 01:08:20.828
<i>Even when I wake,
it is without me as within me.</i>

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:25.032
<i>Not imagined...</i>

01:08:25.774 --> 01:08:27.831
<i>felt.</i>

01:08:58.434 --> 01:09:02.969
O Posthumus! Where is thy head?

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:10.511
Where's that?

01:09:11.714 --> 01:09:14.781
Ay me, where's that?

01:09:16.484 --> 01:09:19.286
And left this head on.

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:39.173
The king.

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:48.584
His daughter, whom he purposed
to his wife's sole son,

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:52.419
a widow that late he married...

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:56.941
Hath referred herself to a poor but...

01:09:57.341 --> 01:09:59.628
worthy gentleman.

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:04.700
She's wedded, her husband banished,
she imprisoned.

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:08.170
All is outward sorrow, though...

01:10:08.670 --> 01:10:12.506
I think the king
be touched at very heart.

01:10:19.181 --> 01:10:21.250
What's his name and birth?

01:10:21.933 --> 01:10:26.189
His father was called Sicilius,
who did join his honor against the Romans

01:10:26.289 --> 01:10:29.725
and had, besides this gentleman
in question, two other sons,

01:10:29.825 --> 01:10:33.830
who in the wars of the time,
died with their swords in hand.

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:36.265
For which their father,

01:10:36.365 --> 01:10:39.368
then old and fond of issue,

01:10:39.468 --> 01:10:44.073
took such sorrow that he quit being.

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:47.943
And his gentle lady,
big of this gentleman our theme,

01:10:48.043 --> 01:10:50.811
deceased as he was born.

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:54.484
The king...

01:10:55.134 --> 01:10:57.853
He takes the babe to his protection,

01:10:57.953 --> 01:11:01.657
calls him Posthumus Leonatus.
Breeds him.

01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:04.677
Puts to him all the learnings that his time
could make him the receiver of,

01:11:04.777 --> 01:11:08.964
which he took as we do air,
fast as 'twas ministered,

01:11:09.064 --> 01:11:13.453
and in it's spring became a harvest.

01:11:13.553 --> 01:11:16.705
Lived in court, which rare it is to do.

01:11:16.805 --> 01:11:20.876
More praised, most loved.

01:11:20.976 --> 01:11:25.014
To his mistress,
for whom he now is banished,

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:27.616
her own price proclaims
how she esteemed him.

01:11:28.499 --> 01:11:32.154
And his virtue by her election may be
truly read what kind of man he is.

01:11:32.954 --> 01:11:35.958
A banished rascal.

01:11:36.258 --> 01:11:38.761
Return he cannot,

01:11:38.861 --> 01:11:40.928
nor continue where he is.

01:11:42.898 --> 01:11:45.032
'Tis strange.

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:13.360
Your service for this time is ended.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:20.332
Take your own way.

01:12:33.115 --> 01:12:36.152
<i>Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes.</i>

01:12:36.252 --> 01:12:40.466
<i>Some falls are means
the happier to arise.</i>

01:12:46.262 --> 01:12:50.799
<i>After laughter</i>

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:54.415
<i>Comes tears</i>

01:12:56.639 --> 01:13:01.076
<i>- After laughter
- After your laughter</i>

01:13:01.176 --> 01:13:05.712
<i>- Comes tears
- There'll be tears</i>

01:13:07.016 --> 01:13:11.754
<i>- Ooh
- When you're in love</i>

01:13:11.854 --> 01:13:16.258
<i>You're happy</i>

01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:18.594
<i>- Oh, and then
- Ooh</i>

01:13:18.694 --> 01:13:20.830
<i>When you're in an arm</i>

01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:24.998
<i>You gaze</i>

01:13:29.171 --> 01:13:34.975
<i>This doesn't last always</i>

01:13:37.946 --> 01:13:42.785
<i>- After laughter
- After your laughter</i>

01:13:42.885 --> 01:13:48.390
<i>There'll be tears</i>

01:13:49.290 --> 01:13:52.161
<i>My friends all say</i>

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:54.763
<i>- Don't...</i>
- Oh!

01:14:02.671 --> 01:14:07.006
<i>Know how I feel</i>

01:14:17.353 --> 01:14:20.354
<i>Is it enough I am sorry?</i>

01:14:23.992 --> 01:14:27.527
<i>For Imogen's dear life, take mine.</i>

01:14:47.282 --> 01:14:49.100
Sons.

01:14:50.352 --> 01:14:52.955
We'll higher to the mountains,
there secure us.

01:14:53.055 --> 01:14:55.791
To the king's party there's no going.
Newness of cloten's death...

01:14:55.891 --> 01:14:59.055
It is not likely that they will waste
their time upon our note,

01:14:59.155 --> 01:15:02.665
- to know from whence we are.
- I am known.

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:06.155
I and my brother are not known.

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:12.040
I scarce ever look on blood
but that of hares, goats, and venison.

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:14.610
I am ashamed to look upon the sun,

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:19.977
to feel the benefit of his blest beams,
remaining so long a poor unknown.

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:23.685
I'll go. If you will bless me, sir,

01:15:23.785 --> 01:15:25.888
and give me leave,
I'll take the better care.

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:28.290
So say I. Amen.

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:32.995
No reason I, since of your lives
you set so slight a valuation,

01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:36.598
should reserve my cracked one
to more care.

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:42.694
Have with you, boys. If in
your country wars you chance to die...

01:15:44.473 --> 01:15:47.275
That is my bed, too, lads,

01:15:47.375 --> 01:15:49.476
and there I'll lie.

01:16:43.999 --> 01:16:47.203
Good my liege, your preparations
can affront no less than what you hear of.

01:16:47.303 --> 01:16:50.172
Come more, for more you're ready.

01:16:50.672 --> 01:16:54.913
The want is but to put those powers
in motion that long to move.

01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:11.658
He's alive.

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:28.777
<i>A rout, confusion thick.</i>

01:17:28.877 --> 01:17:31.079
<i>Forthwith they fly.</i>

01:17:31.179 --> 01:17:35.918
<i>Great the slaughter; an old man
and two boys struck down some mortally,</i>

01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:40.757
<i>some slightly touched,
some falling merely through fear.</i>

01:17:41.357 --> 01:17:46.215
<i>An old man and two boys are grown
the mortal bugs o' the field.</i>

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:55.702
My poor boy...

01:17:58.006 --> 01:18:01.174
Whose face I've never seen...

01:18:04.012 --> 01:18:06.381
I died

01:18:06.481 --> 01:18:10.617
whilst in the womb he stayed,
awaiting nature's law.

01:18:12.004 --> 01:18:16.022
Whose father then...

01:18:18.193 --> 01:18:23.031
As men report thou orphans' father art,

01:18:23.131 --> 01:18:25.501
thou shouldn't have been,

01:18:25.601 --> 01:18:28.003
shielded him

01:18:28.103 --> 01:18:31.037
from this earth-vexing smart.

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:44.751
"Of God we ask one favor,

01:18:45.888 --> 01:18:48.989
that we may be forgiven...

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:54.096
from what, he is presumed to know...

01:18:55.223 --> 01:18:58.434
the crime, from us,

01:18:59.534 --> 01:19:01.481
is hidden...

01:19:05.307 --> 01:19:08.944
immured the whole of life

01:19:09.044 --> 01:19:11.845
within a magic prison."

01:19:56.058 --> 01:19:57.824
Oh...

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:09.371
Come sir, are you ready for death?

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:12.372
I am merrier to die
than you are to live.

01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:30.426
I tell thee, fellow, there are none
want eyes to direct them where I am going,

01:20:30.526 --> 01:20:34.963
but such as wink and will not use them.

01:20:36.698 --> 01:20:38.500
What an infinite mock is this,

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:44.104
that a man should have the best use
of eyes to see the way of blindness.

01:20:55.984 --> 01:20:58.551
Knock off his manacles.

01:21:10.031 --> 01:21:12.732
Bring your prisoner to the king.

01:21:21.443 --> 01:21:25.247
<i>Every good servant
does not all commands:</i>

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:28.514
<i>No bond but to do just ones.</i>

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:31.754
<i>Gods.</i>

01:21:33.154 --> 01:21:36.624
<i>If you should have ta'en vengeance
on my faults,</i>

01:21:36.724 --> 01:21:40.296
<i>I never had lived to put on this:</i>

01:21:41.096 --> 01:21:44.899
<i>So had you saved Imogen and struck me,</i>

01:21:45.259 --> 01:21:48.701
<i>wretch more worth your vengeance.</i>

01:21:50.238 --> 01:21:52.607
<i>For thee,</i>

01:21:52.707 --> 01:21:55.043
<i>o Imogen,</i>

01:21:56.102 --> 01:21:59.348
<i>even for whom my life
is every breath a death;</i>

01:21:59.448 --> 01:22:02.451
<i>and thus, unknown,</i>

01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:08.056
<i>pitied nor hated, to the face
of peril myself I'll dedicate.</i>

01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:20.902
<i>Let me make men know more valor
in me than my habits show.</i>

01:22:21.202 --> 01:22:24.672
<i>Gods, give me the strength</i>

01:22:24.772 --> 01:22:29.256
<i>to shame the guise o' the world,
I will begin the fashion,</i>

01:22:29.356 --> 01:22:31.579
<i>less without</i>

01:22:31.679 --> 01:22:34.113
<i>and more within.</i>

01:22:42.858 --> 01:22:44.559
Stand by my side,

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:49.331
you whom the gods have made
preservers of my throne.

01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:51.567
Knights of the battle,

01:22:51.667 --> 01:22:55.237
I create you companions to our person,

01:22:55.337 --> 01:22:59.238
and fit you with dignities
befitting your estates...

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:17.092
Why so sadly greet you our victory?

01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:18.894
Hail, great king.

01:23:18.994 --> 01:23:22.362
To sour your happiness,
I must report the queen is dead.

01:23:30.739 --> 01:23:32.760
No!

01:23:39.547 --> 01:23:41.950
How ended she?

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:45.144
With horror, madly dying, like her life,

01:23:45.244 --> 01:23:48.857
which, being cruel to the world,
concluded most cruel to herself.

01:23:49.057 --> 01:23:53.026
These her women were present
when she finished.

01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:59.828
First, she confessed
she never loved you,

01:23:59.928 --> 01:24:04.339
only affected greatness
got by you, not you;

01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:08.708
married your royalty, wife to your place;
abhorred your person.

01:24:30.031 --> 01:24:32.300
She alone knew this.

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:37.639
Your daughter she did confess
was as a scorpion to her sight,

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:39.941
whose life,

01:24:40.041 --> 01:24:42.377
but that her flight prevented it,

01:24:42.477 --> 01:24:44.656
she had ta'en off by poison.

01:25:02.864 --> 01:25:06.667
Mine eyes were not in fault, for...

01:25:06.767 --> 01:25:09.437
she was beautiful.

01:25:09.537 --> 01:25:12.741
Mine ears, that heard her flattery.

01:25:12.841 --> 01:25:17.006
Nor my heart, that thought her
like her seeming.

01:25:20.582 --> 01:25:24.617
It had been vicious
to have mistrusted her.

01:25:26.687 --> 01:25:28.290
O my daughter.

01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:30.952
That it was my folly, thou mayst say.

01:25:46.408 --> 01:25:50.578
The day was yours by accident.
Had it gone with us, we should not,

01:25:50.678 --> 01:25:53.580
when the blood was cool, have threatened
our prisoners with the sword.

01:25:58.486 --> 01:26:00.664
But let it come.

01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:06.959
That diamond on your finger,
how came it yours?

01:26:08.997 --> 01:26:11.700
By villainy I got this ring.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:14.083
The good Posthumus.

01:26:14.183 --> 01:26:17.205
What can I say? He were too good
to be where ill men were...

01:26:17.305 --> 01:26:19.975
I stand on fire. Come to the matter.

01:26:20.075 --> 01:26:22.426
Your daughter's chastity.

01:26:22.526 --> 01:26:24.633
- There it begins!
- My daughter?

01:26:24.733 --> 01:26:28.257
I wagered with him
pieces of gold against this

01:26:28.357 --> 01:26:32.887
which then he wore
upon his honored finger

01:26:32.987 --> 01:26:37.890
to attain in suit
the place of his bed...

01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:43.231
To win this ring by hers
and mine adultery.

01:26:43.331 --> 01:26:47.703
At court, I learned your chaste daughter

01:26:47.803 --> 01:26:52.107
and the wide difference
'twixt villainous and amorous.

01:26:52.207 --> 01:26:54.436
And yet...

01:26:54.536 --> 01:26:58.179
I returned with proof enough
to make the noble Posthumus mad.

01:26:58.279 --> 01:27:00.115
Ay.

01:27:00.782 --> 01:27:02.410
Me,

01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:05.153
most credulous fool, o, give me cord,

01:27:05.253 --> 01:27:09.021
or knife, or poison.

01:27:10.871 --> 01:27:12.139
I killed thy daughter.

01:27:14.563 --> 01:27:17.632
Caused a lesser villain
than myself to do it.

01:27:18.877 --> 01:27:21.669
Spit and throw stones,

01:27:21.769 --> 01:27:23.636
cast mire upon me.

01:27:29.351 --> 01:27:31.312
Imogen.

01:27:31.412 --> 01:27:35.751
My queen, my wife.

01:27:36.151 --> 01:27:38.119
- My life...
- Peace.

01:27:38.219 --> 01:27:41.322
- O Imogen...
- My Lord, hear, hear.

01:27:41.422 --> 01:27:44.257
Shall's have a play of this?

01:27:48.263 --> 01:27:52.231
You never killed Imogen... till now.

01:28:12.887 --> 01:28:15.740
Get thee from my sight.
Thou gavest me poison.

01:28:16.755 --> 01:28:20.262
- I had it from the queen...
- Oh, gods.

01:28:21.062 --> 01:28:23.899
I left out one thing
the queen confessed.

01:28:23.999 --> 01:28:27.869
The queen, sir, very often
importuned me to...

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:30.004
temper potions for her,

01:28:30.104 --> 01:28:32.374
still pretending the satisfaction
of her knowledge

01:28:32.474 --> 01:28:36.694
only in killing creatures vile,
cats and dogs.

01:28:36.794 --> 01:28:39.514
I, dreading that her purpose
was of more danger,

01:28:39.614 --> 01:28:42.517
did compound for her a certain stuff

01:28:42.617 --> 01:28:47.622
which being ta'en would cease
the present power of life,

01:28:47.722 --> 01:28:52.327
and in short time all offices of nature

01:28:52.427 --> 01:28:54.996
should do their due function.

01:28:55.096 --> 01:28:57.799
Have you ta'en of it?

01:28:57.899 --> 01:29:01.934
I must have, for I was dead.

01:29:11.246 --> 01:29:16.282
Hang there like fruit, my soul,
till the tree die.

01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:21.954
Imogen.

01:29:26.561 --> 01:29:29.000
Your blessing, sir.

01:29:29.764 --> 01:29:32.297
The queen's dead.

01:29:33.351 --> 01:29:36.701
- I'm sorry for it.
- She was naught.

01:29:37.071 --> 01:29:39.641
Her son is gone, we know not how.

01:29:39.741 --> 01:29:41.976
Let me end the story.

01:29:42.076 --> 01:29:44.312
I slew him.

01:29:44.612 --> 01:29:47.115
He did provoke me.

01:29:47.415 --> 01:29:50.859
I cut off his head and am right glad
he is not standing here to tell the tale.

01:29:50.959 --> 01:29:52.457
Mighty sir,

01:29:52.557 --> 01:29:56.862
these two young gentlemen that call me
father and think they are my sons

01:29:57.172 --> 01:29:59.093
are none of mine.

01:29:59.193 --> 01:30:03.097
They are the issue of your loins,
my liege, the blood of your begetting.

01:30:04.448 --> 01:30:05.466
How?

01:30:05.566 --> 01:30:09.026
I am Belarius whom you banished.

01:30:09.126 --> 01:30:13.274
These gentle princes,
for such and so they are,

01:30:13.374 --> 01:30:18.713
these twenty years
have I trained up, but here...

01:30:18.813 --> 01:30:21.149
here are your sons again,

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:25.887
and I must lose two of the sweetest
companions in the world.

01:30:27.482 --> 01:30:31.425
Guiderius upon his neck had a... a mole,

01:30:31.525 --> 01:30:34.092
a sanguine star.

01:30:35.697 --> 01:30:37.830
This is he.

01:31:06.661 --> 01:31:08.939
Caius Lucius.

01:31:18.239 --> 01:31:20.802
Although the Victor,

01:31:21.409 --> 01:31:25.118
we submit to Caesar
and to the Roman empire...

01:31:27.348 --> 01:31:29.083
Promising to pay our wonted tribute,

01:31:29.183 --> 01:31:32.785
from which we were dissuaded
by our wicked queen.

01:31:51.773 --> 01:31:54.077
Pardon's the word to all.
