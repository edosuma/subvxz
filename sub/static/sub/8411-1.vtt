12:53.506 --> 12:55.242
Doesn't it seem arbitrary?

12:55.308 --> 12:57.277
People having to eat together

12:57.344 --> 12:59.546
as an excuse to have
conversations?

I mean, Toby, is he still
your boyfriend? Or..

13:27.740 --> 13:29.576
Yeah.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.745
I don't know.
I mean..

13:32.812 --> 13:36.216

in relationships anyway.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.819
Hm. Why not?

13:39.887 --> 13:42.255
Is it because
of your mother and me?

13:43.924 --> 13:45.926
No.

13:49.396 --> 13:52.032
What do you think
about mom and me?

13:52.099 --> 13:55.102
As a couple,
our marriage..

13:55.168 --> 13:57.304
How does it strike you?

should you stay married

14:06.746 --> 14:08.748

at least once a week

14:11.851 --> 14:13.386

Um, no.

25:13.913 --> 25:15.514
Not really.

25:15.582 --> 25:17.516
What are you smiling at?

25:17.584 --> 25:20.286
I'm just, um...smiling.

25:22.555 --> 25:24.490
What are your friends
smiling at?

25:24.557 --> 25:28.127

26:50.677 --> 26:52.278

[indistinct]

26:57.750 --> 26:59.551

You and me, man.
It is fucking brilliant.

28:11.357 --> 28:15.061
- You think I look hot?
- Emily, you always look hot.

28:15.127 --> 28:18.931
- You're just saying that.
- Oh, bullshit.

28:18.998 --> 28:20.032
Girl.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.439
Hm. Would you fuck that guy?

28:27.506 --> 28:30.810

28:31.911 --> 28:33.813

28:33.880 --> 28:36.082
I think I'm gonna

Alright. Well, do it, honey.

28:38.851 --> 28:40.386
But no dancin'.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.621

Hey, Amanda.

30:06.973 --> 30:09.208
Hey, Em. Sweety.

30:09.275 --> 30:12.111
Hey, I think we'd better see
about getting the girls

30:12.178 --> 30:13.812
and gettin' home, Okay?

30:13.880 --> 30:15.314
Okay.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.183
Sorry.

30:18.985 --> 30:20.786
(Allison)
'Hey I'll be right there.'

30:20.853 --> 30:22.889
Hector,thanks.

30:22.955 --> 30:24.823
I'm Allison.

30:27.493 --> 30:31.397
Hey, check it out, I was gonna
move this party to a motel.

30:31.463 --> 30:35.434
- You know, the Alvarado.
- Mm-hm.

30:35.501 --> 30:38.470
That's bad, girl, what's that
face you got right there, huh?

30:38.537 --> 30:40.306
It's not even like that.

30:40.372 --> 30:42.942
It's just a place where you'll
be partying you know.

30:43.009 --> 30:45.912
I've got a friend who
gives us a few rooms.

30:45.978 --> 30:49.315
Kick back. Nobody abducted
your ass so far.

30:51.617 --> 30:54.520
- Thanks for letting us chill.
- Yeah.

30:54.586 --> 30:55.687
Hey.

30:55.754 --> 30:57.623
Don't forget. Okay.

30:57.689 --> 31:01.360
Alvarado Motel,
just south of 12th Street.

31:05.131 --> 31:07.133
I can't believe we just
fucking did that!

31:07.199 --> 31:08.834
Yo, Alli's, always on tip.

31:08.901 --> 31:12.905
More fun than giving some rapper
a blow job at Jerry's Deli.

31:12.972 --> 31:13.940
[chuckles]

31:14.006 --> 31:16.042
It was hot.

31:22.781 --> 31:26.652
- Do you want anything?
- 'No. Thank you though.'

31:26.718 --> 31:27.987
Yeah.

31:30.289 --> 31:34.660
We don't talk so much as leave
clues for one another.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.596
I am not a latchkey kid,
I've got latchkey parents.

31:51.710 --> 31:54.680
So, are your latchkey parents
the reason you decided

31:54.746 --> 31:56.815
to join a gang?

31:56.882 --> 31:58.850
Oh-h.

31:58.917 --> 32:03.889
Poor little rich girl needs
the gang as mi familia. Funny!

32:03.956 --> 32:05.924
Someone once said,
"Friends are just..

32:05.992 --> 32:08.460
"...God's way of apologizing
for family."

32:08.527 --> 32:12.031
How can I complain if I say
one word, it's like..

32:12.098 --> 32:14.466
look at your life, There are
people starving in India.

32:14.533 --> 32:17.303
There are people starving
in Santa Monica. You know?

32:18.437 --> 32:20.706
I thought they take them
downtown to starve.

32:22.174 --> 32:25.477
All I am saying is, you know
that's not an excuse.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.279
I am not making excuses.

32:27.346 --> 32:30.649
You don't have to get angry.
I'm just interviewing you.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.718
I'm not getting angry.

32:34.353 --> 32:36.788
Let me ask you something?

32:36.855 --> 32:39.191
Hypothetically.

32:39.258 --> 32:42.461
Is it possible that..

32:42.528 --> 32:46.732
...all this
is really about you

32:46.798 --> 32:51.570
being attracted...to me?

32:51.637 --> 32:53.039
[chuckles]

32:56.275 --> 32:59.011
Maybe, I don't know.

32:59.078 --> 33:01.880
Oh, I think you do.
You are a smart guy.

33:01.947 --> 33:05.651
You just don't know if
I feel the same way, so..

33:05.717 --> 33:08.820
...you are playing hard
to get in your guy way.

33:08.887 --> 33:10.689
It's so dishonest.

33:10.756 --> 33:13.959
Have you noticed that when you
get serious, you stop talkin all

33:14.026 --> 33:15.961
you know, street
and dope and shit.

33:16.028 --> 33:19.298
I can be lot of people,
I can be like you.

33:19.365 --> 33:21.933
Hm.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.072
Gee, Dr. McConnelly your..

33:26.138 --> 33:28.274
...position on cultural
ethics is fascinating.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.709
And really applies
to the post-Clinton era

33:30.776 --> 33:32.478
in American politics

33:32.544 --> 33:35.047
I, just..

33:35.114 --> 33:38.717
...I just cant wait till
I am old enough to vote.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.919
Allison.

33:40.986 --> 33:43.489
Do you want to be
a different person?

33:43.555 --> 33:46.192
- Do you wanna make love to me?
- No, seriously though.

33:46.258 --> 33:48.427
Isn't this with all
the clothes and the talk

33:48.494 --> 33:50.762
you know, isn't
that what is all about?

33:51.730 --> 33:54.366
No, seriously.

33:56.268 --> 33:58.504
Do you wanna fuck me?

34:01.640 --> 34:04.276
I am just trying
to get to know you here.

34:04.343 --> 34:05.911
And you're acting like
a porn star.

34:05.977 --> 34:10.449
Oh, God! My nipples are hard.
Oh, God, oh, God!

34:12.118 --> 34:13.719
'Oh, my God, Eric.'

34:13.784 --> 34:17.989
Eric, hooking up with you
would feel so good. Oh-h.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.492
Do you ever
take anything seriously?

34:21.827 --> 34:25.496
How do you know I'm not
taking this seriously?

34:25.563 --> 34:28.100
'Cause this is
a fucked up power game.

34:30.202 --> 34:32.571
[whispering]
Games are fun.

34:32.638 --> 34:35.507
Could-could you
cover up, please?

34:43.181 --> 34:45.484
Well, that's great footage, huh?

34:45.551 --> 34:47.753
That'll really get
the math team going.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.389
Yeah, thanks.

34:58.730 --> 35:01.533
You know.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.868
[sighs]

35:02.934 --> 35:05.271
- What?
- It's nothin'.

35:07.406 --> 35:10.376
No, Eric. What were you
gonna say?

35:10.442 --> 35:12.611
Come on, I don't want
to hurt your feelings.

35:12.678 --> 35:15.714
You're gonna hurt
my feelings?

35:15.781 --> 35:17.716
Come on. Say it.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.485
No, it's just..

35:21.887 --> 35:24.556
You're one of the loneliest
people I've ever met.

Hey, why do you hang

37:33.852 --> 37:37.623
I mean, couldn't you make
more money somewhere else?

37:37.689 --> 37:40.492

- Somewhere else?

37:40.559 --> 37:43.094
Where the fuck you
want me to be at, huh?

37:43.161 --> 37:47.065
Beverly Hills, sell
some rock on Rodeo Drive?

37:47.132 --> 37:50.402
It's my world right here.
It's my home. It's where I live.

You know what the
most fucked up thing is?

38:50.596 --> 38:53.399
People come around here
and they think that all we do

38:53.465 --> 38:55.367
is sell drugs here, you know?

39:36.975 --> 39:40.345
I don't think your
friend likes me.

39:40.412 --> 39:44.049
He's my brother.
He's my older brother.

39:44.115 --> 39:46.117
He's big-time here.

39:48.820 --> 39:52.390
Listen, I wanna
show you something.

39:52.458 --> 39:54.392
Come here.

39:55.260 --> 39:56.862
[Allison chuckles]

40:00.666 --> 40:02.868
Come here. Have a seat.

40:07.806 --> 40:10.442
I want you to be
my eyes with me.

40:10.509 --> 40:12.010
Look it.

40:12.077 --> 40:16.482
Every body smokes rock.

40:16.548 --> 40:19.150
Rock doesn't only get
the poor people off.

40:19.217 --> 40:22.454
You got everything
got Mercedes, got BMW..

40:22.521 --> 40:23.989
[siren blaring]

40:24.055 --> 40:25.757
Vamonos!

40:27.993 --> 40:29.027
[tires screeching]

40:33.164 --> 40:36.434
- L.A.P.D.! Stay where you are!
- Oh, fuck!

40:36.502 --> 40:38.003
Hands where I can see 'em!

40:38.069 --> 40:41.072
(male #11)
'Come on, now, girl.
Let me see your hands.'

40:41.139 --> 40:42.941
Hands on your head.
Interlace your fingers.

40:43.008 --> 40:44.976
Put 'em on the back
of your head.

40:45.043 --> 40:47.579
Let's go, Hector.
Spit out the cigarette.

40:47.646 --> 40:49.515
- Spit it out.
- Easy. Come on.

40:49.581 --> 40:52.417
'Let's go. This way.'

40:52.484 --> 40:54.686
'Turn around.
Up against the fence.'

40:56.655 --> 40:58.857
Let's go. Keep moving.

41:04.195 --> 41:06.197
Spread your legs.

41:08.934 --> 41:10.468
Spread 'em.

41:12.103 --> 41:14.973
- You got some I.D.?
- Yeah.

41:15.040 --> 41:17.643
Is there anything in here I,
hands on your head!

41:17.709 --> 41:20.278
Is there anything in here
I need to know about?

41:20.345 --> 41:22.781
- No.
- Knife? Needles? Gun?

41:24.750 --> 41:25.951
Pacific Palisades.

41:26.017 --> 41:29.420
You get lost looking
for Hollywood?

41:29.487 --> 41:32.057
Spit it out! Spit it out!

41:32.123 --> 41:33.659
Spit it out!

41:33.725 --> 41:36.562
What we got?
40 worth of rock.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.797
You should've swallowed it, Ace.
You're under arrest.

41:38.864 --> 41:40.699
Yeah, I got something
you can swallow.

41:40.766 --> 41:44.035
Come on, I want to talk with
you. You can drop 'em.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.639
- 'Just tell me the truth.'
- No, listen.

41:47.706 --> 41:49.074
I--I stopped
to ask for directions

41:49.140 --> 41:51.009
because I missed
the ten by accident--

41:51.076 --> 41:53.645
Okay, that's it. You're
underage, you're loitering.

41:53.712 --> 41:56.347
You're going down
to the station.

41:56.414 --> 41:59.017
- Oh, my..
- Get In the car!

41:59.084 --> 42:00.886
Watch your head.

42:04.055 --> 42:07.225
The cop started asking me
these really stupid questions

42:07.292 --> 42:11.529
like, what's closer to you now,
the moon or Europe?

42:11.597 --> 42:14.566
Fuck you is closer to me now.

42:14.633 --> 42:17.202
I've been to Knott's Berry Farm.

42:17.268 --> 42:18.904
[laughs]

42:20.271 --> 42:22.207
What'd you do?

42:22.273 --> 42:23.609
Hm? Me?

42:23.675 --> 42:26.511
No, the debutante
sitting next to you.

42:26.578 --> 42:29.147
'Fuck. Vice cop asked me
where my dick is.'

42:29.214 --> 42:32.751
Darling, I did Axl Rose
and you don't get him

42:32.818 --> 42:34.686
with a dick down there.

42:39.858 --> 42:42.260
You don't got any Dilaudid
shoved up your ass

42:42.327 --> 42:44.095
to get her to stop doing that.

42:44.162 --> 42:45.263
No.

42:46.632 --> 42:47.866
Positive?

42:50.268 --> 42:52.337
You can check if you like.

42:52.403 --> 42:53.839
[laughs]

42:56.507 --> 42:59.310
Yeah. In your dreams.

43:05.383 --> 43:07.318
- Allison Lang?
- Yeah.

43:07.385 --> 43:09.788
'Your parents are here.'

43:14.425 --> 43:16.027
Bitch got parents?

43:26.037 --> 43:29.007
You got arrested!
With crack dealers!

43:39.685 --> 43:43.188
Maybe this hasn't been the
easiest place to live lately.

43:49.695 --> 43:52.263
Alright. Then we
talk about it.

43:52.330 --> 43:54.632
'That's what we're
supposed to do.'

43:54.700 --> 43:57.468
One of us has a problem,
we all talk it over.

43:57.535 --> 43:59.270
Oh, right. Who are you kidding?

43:59.337 --> 44:02.107
Who could ever talk to you
when you're never even here?

44:02.173 --> 44:05.143
Well, I'm gonna make it
easy for you to find me.

44:05.210 --> 44:06.644
You're grounded.

44:06.712 --> 44:08.179
Hasn't she already
suffered enough.

44:08.246 --> 44:10.682
And besides,
what good would it do?

44:10.749 --> 44:12.417
Wha..

44:12.483 --> 44:14.219
I don't want any soup, Mom.

44:14.285 --> 44:17.689
What were you doing downtown
in the first place?

44:19.124 --> 44:21.059
I was sick of
this phony life.

44:21.126 --> 44:23.128
Alright, stop it,
stop it, both of you.

44:23.194 --> 44:25.430
This whole thing
is just gonna go away.

44:26.865 --> 44:29.067
Tomato or chicken with rice?

44:32.804 --> 44:35.573
Alli, you're
so fucking down.

44:35.640 --> 44:37.675
Like, doing hard
time and shit?

44:37.743 --> 44:39.610
No. No, It wasn't like that.

44:39.677 --> 44:43.314
I heard that you hit a cop
and you got into a knife fight.

44:43.381 --> 44:46.184
No. No, no, guys.
It was more like...detentions.

44:46.251 --> 44:47.853
See ya later.

44:48.954 --> 44:49.988
Bye.

44:51.056 --> 44:52.758
So, I wonder
what daddy thought.

44:52.824 --> 44:55.927
Please. Daddy waved his magic
wand and it went away.

44:57.095 --> 44:58.797
- Whoa.
- What's your problem?

44:58.864 --> 45:01.733
Hey, what the fuck
is this I'm hearing?

45:01.800 --> 45:04.269
Yo, she was in lockup,
motherfucker. What?

45:04.335 --> 45:07.405
Well, going to jail
is fucked up.

45:07.472 --> 45:10.208
What? It was
juvenile detention centre.

45:10.275 --> 45:13.011
Did you go back down
to that fucking spot?

45:14.746 --> 45:16.047
Huh?

45:16.114 --> 45:18.049
Hey, shorty, you gettin'
a rap sheet?

45:18.116 --> 45:20.485
The man gonna be fuckin'
three strikin' your ass, kid.

45:20.551 --> 45:23.321
How're you gonna rep
it without the P.L.C, huh?

45:23.388 --> 45:25.957
Yo, maybe she don't need
the P.L.C, motherfucker.

45:26.024 --> 45:28.193
P.L.C is the only
family we got.

45:28.259 --> 45:31.429
- Ooh, I'm scared now.
- Let's bounce.

45:31.496 --> 45:33.431
Why you gotta be like that?

45:33.498 --> 45:34.966
[bell ringing]

45:35.033 --> 45:37.002
They don't even know
what a family is.

45:37.068 --> 45:39.037
You don't wanna think
that you're with someone

45:39.104 --> 45:41.372
just because everyone else
thinks you should be

45:41.439 --> 45:43.809
because we're not assigned
to people, like you know

45:43.875 --> 45:47.412
parking spaces and um,
and you do love him.

45:47.478 --> 45:50.415
You know, I mean,
God, you've known him forever

45:50.481 --> 45:56.054
and he's great and fun
and makes sense and..

45:56.121 --> 46:00.491
So, yeah, the whole thing
seems predetermined, but, um..

46:02.227 --> 46:05.763
...you find yourself
like...giving him a blowjob

46:05.831 --> 46:09.300
and it feels like a performance.

46:09.367 --> 46:14.139
Okay, it is a performance,
but...um, what I mean is

46:14.205 --> 46:20.345
that...that you can't
like feel it.

46:22.047 --> 46:24.649
It doesn't even seem real,
it seems like a dream

46:24.715 --> 46:28.086
like you're just..

46:28.153 --> 46:30.788
...sleep walking
through your life, you know.

46:30.856 --> 46:31.823
(Eric)
'Hm.'

46:31.890 --> 46:33.825
Does that make any sense?

46:33.892 --> 46:35.861
Yeah.

46:35.927 --> 46:39.297
But what...what is in a dream?

46:39.364 --> 46:40.832
Okay.

46:42.033 --> 46:46.905
Um, the other night
I was with Emily and we were

46:46.972 --> 46:53.211
at this crazy party downtown
and...I don't know

46:53.278 --> 46:56.047
we just sat there
together and..

46:56.114 --> 46:59.284
(Eric)
'And what?'

46:59.350 --> 47:01.286
I don't know.

47:01.352 --> 47:05.256
I just love her, you know.
It seemed real.

47:10.328 --> 47:13.498
So what was it like in there?

47:13.564 --> 47:17.435
It was totally fucking real.
It smelled like puke.

47:17.502 --> 47:20.171
And it was so bright
it made my eyes hurt.

47:20.238 --> 47:23.041
And there were these hookers
in there and it was like

47:23.108 --> 47:24.842
business as usual for them.

47:24.910 --> 47:29.080
And this one white chick
who thought she was super bad

47:29.147 --> 47:31.282
but you know I think
she just wanted

47:31.349 --> 47:35.053
to appropriate my wardrobe.

47:35.120 --> 47:37.322
I love your nails.

47:37.388 --> 47:38.656
Were you scared?

47:38.723 --> 47:42.193
Oh, I was scared shit.

47:42.260 --> 47:48.333
I don't know.
I was helpless, but excited.

47:50.835 --> 47:52.570
What if it's like

47:52.637 --> 47:56.407
we're on our deathbeds and we're
looking back at our lives

47:56.474 --> 48:00.378
and like all the guys we've like
loved and just like fucked and

48:00.445 --> 48:05.216
and it turns out that
like the whole time, like

48:05.283 --> 48:07.652
we were supposed
to be together.

48:12.790 --> 48:14.192
[Emily screaming]

48:14.259 --> 48:15.994
(Emily)
Oh, my God.

48:26.537 --> 48:29.340
I don't think I
could go down on you.

48:32.410 --> 48:34.312
Mm.

48:34.379 --> 48:36.081
It's okay.

48:37.382 --> 48:40.151
Oh, my God. Oh, I can't believe
I almost forgot this

48:40.218 --> 48:42.420
I will be right back.

48:43.554 --> 48:45.190
Okay.

48:46.124 --> 48:48.426
You're gonna love this.

48:48.493 --> 48:50.028
Super surprise.

48:51.929 --> 48:54.565
Now...are you ready?

48:54.632 --> 48:56.501
Super surprise.

48:56.567 --> 48:59.437
The dark dungeon and..

48:59.504 --> 49:02.573
- What is that?
- Put out your hand.

49:03.441 --> 49:04.742
Crack cocaine.

49:04.809 --> 49:07.945
- Where did you get this from?
- Whatever. A lady never tells.

49:08.013 --> 49:09.780
Oh, my God.
How do we do it?

49:09.847 --> 49:13.051
Um, okay, so I called the
drug hot line and asked them

49:13.118 --> 49:15.520
what signs to look for
if my mom smoked crack.

49:15.586 --> 49:18.089
They said little pieces
of aluminum foil everywhere.

49:18.156 --> 49:22.027
So...you wanna
try it, right?

49:22.093 --> 49:24.729
- Yeah.
- Alright. Cool.

49:24.795 --> 49:26.397
Ready?

49:26.464 --> 49:27.832
[lighter clicks]

49:27.898 --> 49:30.968
- You're such a crack head.
- We are such crack heads.

49:31.036 --> 49:33.504
Okay. Oh, shit. Go.
Just inhale it. Just..

49:34.039 --> 49:35.573
Ah, shit.

49:35.640 --> 49:37.575
- Shit, where'd it go?
- It splattered.

49:37.642 --> 49:42.513
- It got me right there.
- Oh, mwah, I'm sorry.

49:42.580 --> 49:43.848
[sobbing]

49:43.914 --> 49:45.316
Whitney is right.

49:45.383 --> 49:47.885
- Crack is wack.
- Crack is wack.

49:47.952 --> 49:50.755
- Shit. Yeah, it is.
- Oh, my God.

49:50.821 --> 49:52.857
That was fun.

49:52.923 --> 49:55.093
Mm.

49:55.160 --> 49:57.728
I wanna go downtown
with you.

49:57.795 --> 50:00.365
You do?

50:00.431 --> 50:05.303
Yeah, I don't know. I just want
to like feel it. I don't know.

50:05.370 --> 50:09.040
Well, fuck you...bitch.

50:09.107 --> 50:10.341
* Bounce with me,

Yo, tomorrow after school.

50:14.145 --> 50:15.580
* You don't gotta be rich,
but fuck that *

50:15.646 --> 50:17.815
* How we gonna get around

50:17.882 --> 50:20.051
* Before I put this pussy
on your moustache *

50:20.118 --> 50:23.421
* Can you afford me? My niggas
breadwinners, never poor *

50:23.488 --> 50:25.390
* Ambition gets me so horny

50:25.456 --> 50:27.092
* Not the fussin'
and the frontin' *

50:27.158 --> 50:28.693
* If you got nothin', baby boy

50:28.759 --> 50:30.728

[music continues]

52:13.864 --> 52:16.667
Hey, what are you doing here?
Stop right there.

52:18.569 --> 52:22.207
What the fuck, eh? They took us
downtown, held us for two hours.

52:22.273 --> 52:24.642
They thought they could
get something outta you.

52:24.709 --> 52:27.445
- I don't know anything.
- She didn't say shit.

52:29.647 --> 52:32.450
Slow down, white girl.
I know she didn't.

52:32.517 --> 52:34.719
Because they didn't arrest us.

52:36.521 --> 52:38.789
Check it out.
This is a party for Javy.

52:38.856 --> 52:43.828
- He just got baptized.
- Aw. Is he your baby?

52:43.894 --> 52:46.030
No.

52:46.096 --> 52:47.998
- No?
- Mm-mm.

52:48.065 --> 52:50.635
We're gonna be kicking it
at the Alvarado later.

52:50.701 --> 52:54.104
Maybe like in
about half an hour.

52:54.171 --> 52:56.274
So we'll see you there?

53:01.746 --> 53:03.514
(Emily)
'Bye.'

53:09.954 --> 53:12.557
[upbeat music]

53:30.341 --> 53:33.944
What's up? Wake up, sleepy?

53:34.011 --> 53:35.746
Hey, cerveza?

53:37.548 --> 53:40.751
[indistinct chatter
and laughter]

53:42.353 --> 53:45.556
[upbeat music]

53:59.537 --> 54:02.340
[music continues]

54:04.775 --> 54:06.844
- Let's roll.
- Yeah.

54:10.615 --> 54:13.250
- Who's your papi?
- Joto.

54:19.089 --> 54:22.493
Get him a fuckin' calculator,
this motherfucker, right here.

54:23.994 --> 54:25.062
Twenty.

54:25.129 --> 54:26.964
Bullshit.

54:27.031 --> 54:28.366
Aah!

54:29.199 --> 54:30.535
Aah!

54:32.036 --> 54:35.973
I want to do the next one.
Okay, here we go.

54:45.282 --> 54:46.617
Mexican.

54:46.684 --> 54:49.820
(male #12)
'Ooh. I believe!'

54:49.887 --> 54:52.289
I think, it's bullshit.

54:59.163 --> 55:01.399
- I don't lie.
- 'Oh!'

55:01.466 --> 55:02.900
- You gotta drink.
- 'Whoo!'

55:02.967 --> 55:07.772
- 'Drink it, homes, drink it!'
- Here you go.

55:07.838 --> 55:10.408
- 'Whoo! Very nice.'
- 'That's hot.'

55:12.643 --> 55:14.979
Oh, I'm gonna get you
so drunk tonight.

55:15.045 --> 55:16.347
[laughing]

55:16.414 --> 55:19.484
- 'Oh, shit.'
- We'll see about that.

55:21.519 --> 55:23.621
(male #13)
'You're her bitch, homes.'

55:30.628 --> 55:33.598
- Go! Go!
- Whoo!

55:33.664 --> 55:36.501
- Do that shit, man!
- 'Oh. Get it!'

55:42.507 --> 55:45.810
Chupando como la
16th Street, cabrones.

55:49.947 --> 55:53.283
Hey...can you ask?

55:53.350 --> 55:54.819
You ask.

55:54.885 --> 55:57.287
- 'I can't.'
- 'Why? Why can't you ask?'

55:57.354 --> 55:58.623
- No, come on. You.
- No.

55:58.689 --> 56:00.157
- You.
- No.

56:00.224 --> 56:02.927
They like you better.

56:02.993 --> 56:05.362
Okay. Okay.

56:05.430 --> 56:09.667
Um...I gotta ask
you a question.

56:09.734 --> 56:13.103
We were wondering
if we could join your crew.

56:15.139 --> 56:16.574
Wh-what?

56:16.641 --> 56:18.809
I mean, you know,
like, hang out with you.

56:18.876 --> 56:21.078
Like, hm, yeah,
be in your crew.

56:24.949 --> 56:27.084
You mean you want
to join 16th?

56:27.151 --> 56:28.753
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

56:28.819 --> 56:32.089
Be all down and shit, like a
fuckin' O.G. in the house?

56:32.156 --> 56:34.459
Yo, we're down, you know.
We just thought--

56:34.525 --> 56:36.494
- Are you gonna work a corner?
- Ha-ha!

56:36.561 --> 56:39.930
Huh? Move a little rock
of Bonnie Brae.

56:39.997 --> 56:42.767
Like an after school job?
How about Beverly Hills?

56:42.833 --> 56:45.202
Maybe you can open up
a fuckin' franchise, huh?

56:45.269 --> 56:47.404
- Fuck you.
- 'Oh, shit.'

56:47.472 --> 56:49.406
Oh, that's some
fucked up shit, homes.

56:49.474 --> 56:50.608
[Emily and Allison laughing]

56:50.675 --> 56:52.076
[people whispering]

56:52.142 --> 56:54.378
No, no, no..

56:54.445 --> 56:56.681
Not fuck me.

56:58.415 --> 57:00.017
[speaking in Spanish]

57:00.084 --> 57:03.053
She wants to join 16th.
What do you think about that?

57:03.120 --> 57:06.090
Hey, pendejo.

57:06.156 --> 57:09.159
[speaking in Spanish]

57:11.428 --> 57:15.032
What? Okay. You know you wanna
make fun of us? We're gone.

57:15.099 --> 57:19.403
- Hey, gabacha.
- My name's Allison.

57:19.470 --> 57:21.138
- Allison.
- Ooh.

57:21.205 --> 57:23.273
Allison.

57:23.340 --> 57:24.642
Allison.

57:27.645 --> 57:31.181
So you want to set
16th Street, huh?

57:31.248 --> 57:34.652
Well, you gotta do it like
every other lady here, girl.

57:36.487 --> 57:38.689
Well, what do we gotta do?

57:41.025 --> 57:43.027
It's a dice game.

57:45.262 --> 57:46.664
You got to..

57:46.731 --> 57:50.501
...you got to do it
with our people.

57:50.568 --> 57:54.271
You know what I mean?
You understand?

57:54.338 --> 57:57.041
- Do it.
- Heh! Stop!

57:57.107 --> 58:00.811
Each of you rolls one time,
but whatever number you get

58:00.878 --> 58:04.148
that's the number
of my friends you take..

58:04.214 --> 58:05.750
...in there.

58:11.355 --> 58:12.690
Okay.

58:15.960 --> 58:19.997
- But I choose the friends.
- Ooh. Look out.

58:24.969 --> 58:26.070
Alright.

58:26.136 --> 58:28.739
[Emily giggling]

58:30.240 --> 58:31.842
Come on.

58:36.180 --> 58:38.115
Yeah, come on, man.

58:38.182 --> 58:39.449
[speaking in Spanish]

58:39.516 --> 58:41.085
Alright, man.

58:44.822 --> 58:47.257
Watch me bag
that shit up, homes.

58:51.061 --> 58:55.465
Alright. Here we are.
You girls are down, right?

58:55.532 --> 58:57.735
- Yeah.
- Who's going first?

58:59.670 --> 59:02.239
- You?
- You.

59:02.306 --> 59:03.507
I'll go first.

59:03.574 --> 59:05.009
You?

59:10.547 --> 59:11.816
[chuckling]

59:12.650 --> 59:15.085
- Big six!
- Seven.

59:15.152 --> 59:17.154
Oh, shit.

59:18.623 --> 59:21.091
- Oh!
- One?

59:21.158 --> 59:22.993
Just one.

59:23.060 --> 59:26.697
So be thinking
about who you want, okay?

59:26.764 --> 59:29.066
- It's your turn.
- Okay.

59:31.769 --> 59:33.303
Whoa. Okay.

59:35.305 --> 59:36.573
- Oh!
- Three?

59:36.641 --> 59:38.475
- 'Yeah! Yeah!
- 'Three?'

59:38.542 --> 59:40.778
Big three.

59:40.845 --> 59:44.381
Three is cool.
I can handle three.

59:44.448 --> 59:46.216
It's just sex.

59:47.752 --> 59:51.622
Well, if it's just sex who do
you want to start with first?

59:55.392 --> 59:56.794
[speaking in Spanish]

59:56.861 --> 59:59.429
Ah, ha ha ha!

59:59.496 --> 01:00:01.832
Alright. Hurry up, homes.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:08.205
And you?

01:00:15.412 --> 01:00:17.181
[panting]

01:00:51.515 --> 01:00:52.950
Ugh!

01:00:53.017 --> 01:00:54.819
Ha-ha-ha!

01:01:40.164 --> 01:01:41.365
[panting]

01:01:45.936 --> 01:01:49.907
Uh...stop.
I'm so sorry.

01:01:49.974 --> 01:01:53.443
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
I can't, I can't do it.

01:01:54.745 --> 01:01:57.181
No. Please.

01:01:58.048 --> 01:02:00.250
No. Please. Please.

01:02:09.794 --> 01:02:12.462
Em? Em, we can go.

01:02:12.529 --> 01:02:14.264
Oh! I'm doing this.

01:02:14.331 --> 01:02:16.901
What? No, Em. Come on.
Okay, listen to me.

01:02:16.967 --> 01:02:19.136
All I ever do
is listen to you. Ha!

01:02:19.203 --> 01:02:21.171
Fuck it. Let's go.
Alright? Come on.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:24.708
- Get the fuck out of here.
- He said we could go, okay?

01:02:24.775 --> 01:02:27.444
We're going, Emily.
Just, we gotta..

01:02:27.511 --> 01:02:29.780
No, I'm doing this.

01:02:32.883 --> 01:02:37.087
And I want Hector first.
Just let me do my thing.

01:02:37.154 --> 01:02:39.957
[speaking in Spanish]

01:02:43.794 --> 01:02:46.196
- Let's go.
- No. Emily..

01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:49.199
- Let's go.
- What the fu..

01:03:11.388 --> 01:03:12.456
Yeah.

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:24.134
Ohh. Harder. Harder.

01:03:45.622 --> 01:03:47.224
Oh, Stop it!
Stop.

01:03:47.291 --> 01:03:49.994
What the fuck
is wrong with you? Bitch!

01:03:51.962 --> 01:03:53.931
(Allison)
'Emily? Emily?'

01:03:53.998 --> 01:03:55.933
- Oh, my God. Emily. Emily.
- No! No!

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.102
- It's me! Emily! Shh! Shh!
- No!

01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:01.071
- 'Look at me. It's me.
- Aah!

01:04:01.138 --> 01:04:05.242
- Okay? Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Eres loca.

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:09.179
I'm here. It's me. It's okay.

01:04:09.246 --> 01:04:11.248
You're okay.
You're okay.

01:04:11.315 --> 01:04:13.483
What the fuck is it
with you two?

01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:16.253
What do you fuckin' want?

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:20.024
It's okay.
Let's go home, okay?

01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:30.400
They're gone. It's okay.

01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:34.604
I'm so sorry.

01:05:04.568 --> 01:05:08.105
Okay, so, you're all aware
that the government bailed out

01:05:08.172 --> 01:05:10.207
the savings and loan industry
in the 90's?

01:05:10.274 --> 01:05:12.442
'We also talked about the
independent record label..'

01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:14.444
(whispering)
Hey! Hey, where's Emily?

01:05:14.511 --> 01:05:17.414
- I heard she went home sick.
- Went home?

01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:20.484
'While he was serving time
in jail he used his thug image'

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:24.088
'to promote a successful
record company.'

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:27.958
Anyone see a correlation here?

01:05:28.025 --> 01:05:31.328
Anyone? Allison?

01:05:32.562 --> 01:05:34.999
Oh. Um..

01:05:35.065 --> 01:05:37.867
...both are examples
of legal profiteering

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:40.037
from illegal activities.

01:05:40.104 --> 01:05:42.472
'You want to connect the dots?'

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:47.944
Economics and ethics don't mix.

01:05:48.012 --> 01:05:52.882
Individuals and governments both
pursue their own self interest

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:56.020
often, uh, carelessly and..

01:05:57.587 --> 01:06:00.957
...no one's willing to take
responsibility for anything.

01:06:01.925 --> 01:06:03.627
Good.

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:12.036
'Em?'

01:06:12.102 --> 01:06:14.738
Em, are you there? Pick up.

01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:21.678
Okay.

01:06:21.745 --> 01:06:24.348
Call me, please.

01:06:24.848 --> 01:06:26.550
Bye.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.722
[car engine rumbling]

01:06:53.777 --> 01:06:55.945
What the fuck you doing here?

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:57.981
We need to talk.
Can we just go..

01:06:58.048 --> 01:07:01.118
Hey, whoa, stop.
Stop. Hey! Stop it.

01:07:01.185 --> 01:07:03.887
Can you talk
to me for a minute?

01:07:03.953 --> 01:07:06.223
What the fuck you playin'?

01:07:08.158 --> 01:07:10.427
What you want, gabacha?

01:07:13.163 --> 01:07:16.333
Why did you do that
to us last night?

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.535
Do what?

01:07:18.602 --> 01:07:22.072
Huh? We did exactly
what you wanted us to do.

01:07:22.139 --> 01:07:24.308
You wanted in 16th Street,
you didn't make it.

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:26.510
Hold it. You think
that Emily wanted that?

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:29.613
- Who? Emily?
- Yeah. Yeah, you know--

01:07:29.679 --> 01:07:33.550
Emily? Cual es Emily? Oh, si la
chiquita, la putita? Huh?

01:07:33.617 --> 01:07:36.820
The one who got drunk and played
us like a fuckin' punk, huh?

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:40.324
No, she wasn't playing. Alright?
That wasn't a game to her.

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:42.392
Bullshit! Everything's
a fuckin' game to you two!

01:07:42.459 --> 01:07:47.164
You don't know me, okay?
You don't know shit about me!

01:07:47.231 --> 01:07:52.136
Oh...that's where
you're wrong, girl.

01:07:52.202 --> 01:07:54.904
I know everything
about you.

01:07:54.971 --> 01:07:57.073
Yeah, I can see
right through you.

01:07:57.141 --> 01:07:59.143
Everything to you
is a fuckin' game.

01:07:59.209 --> 01:08:02.879
- You ain't real.
- That's not true.

01:08:02.946 --> 01:08:05.549
Oh, it's true.

01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:09.085
You ain't real.
I'm real, right?

01:08:09.153 --> 01:08:11.455
There ain't nothin' real
about you.

01:08:11.521 --> 01:08:14.224
Your talk ain't real,
your walk ain't real.

01:08:14.291 --> 01:08:16.292
The way you dress ain't real.

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:18.328
Don't even copy 'em
from the real thing.

01:08:18.395 --> 01:08:20.529
You fuckin' get it
from the TV.

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:22.732
Hector.

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:26.303
Momentito.

01:08:30.073 --> 01:08:33.910
What you thought? Like I was in
love with you or somethin'?

01:08:33.977 --> 01:08:37.346
'Is that what it is? Huh?'

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:40.550
I don't know where you belong,
but it ain't here, girl.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:43.553
Fine.

01:08:51.895 --> 01:08:55.332
That's the guy.
That's definitely the guy. Yeah.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:57.401
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:08:57.466 --> 01:09:00.337
- Do you know this guy?
- Yes.

01:09:01.171 --> 01:09:02.872
Excuse me.

01:09:07.544 --> 01:09:10.880
Yo. Come on.
Come on. We got to talk.

01:09:12.782 --> 01:09:15.519
You want to tell me
what happened to Emily?

01:09:15.585 --> 01:09:18.354
What the fuck were you guys
doing in some hotel room

01:09:18.421 --> 01:09:20.557
in the slums
with another crew?

01:09:20.624 --> 01:09:22.091
Shut up!

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:25.362
Alli, you fuckin' hear me?
I'm talkin' to you. Talk to me!

01:09:25.429 --> 01:09:27.464
- Come on!
- Fuck off.

01:09:27.531 --> 01:09:29.933
Yo, I ain't gonna let
this shit slide, Alli.

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:31.734
You're out the P.L.C.

01:09:31.801 --> 01:09:34.170
Mr. Shapiro, we're here
to investigate a gang rape.

01:09:34.238 --> 01:09:36.171
We just want
to talk to her.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.207
Detective, Allison
knows nothing about it.

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:42.212
Her friend has been raped.
Allison was in the next room.

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:43.546
We just want cooperation

01:09:43.613 --> 01:09:45.982
in identifying the man
who violated her friend.

01:09:46.049 --> 01:09:48.417
I can't believe you think
that Emily was raped.

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:51.321
- And I hung out and watched.
- Alli, let Robert handle this.

01:09:51.388 --> 01:09:53.756
Detective, Alli can't
be of any use to you.

01:09:53.823 --> 01:09:56.960
She didn't see anything.
She can't identify anyone.

01:09:58.728 --> 01:10:01.331
This is insane. I don't know
anything about a rape.

01:10:01.398 --> 01:10:03.600
[indistinct chatter]

01:10:10.507 --> 01:10:12.676
Those little bitches are
gonna testify against Hector

01:10:12.742 --> 01:10:15.078
and put his ass away, homeboy.

01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:16.746
[siren blaring]

01:10:20.183 --> 01:10:22.452
What do you want
to do, ese?

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:24.888
Go after them.

01:10:24.954 --> 01:10:27.757
Hit 'em up,
shut 'em up.

01:10:28.492 --> 01:10:30.894
[speaking in Spanish]

01:10:39.469 --> 01:10:42.071
Sweetheart, I owe you
an apology.

01:10:42.138 --> 01:10:45.108
We talked to the Rubins
and they told us what happened.

01:10:45.174 --> 01:10:47.744
- They did?
- Yeah.

01:10:47.811 --> 01:10:50.814
Oh, thank God.
I told Emily yesterday.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.249
I said th-th-that
I hoped that she would say--

01:10:53.317 --> 01:10:54.918
Nobody blames you.

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:58.622
Emily got isolated in another
room where she got attacked.

01:11:00.657 --> 01:11:02.826
- What?
- You kids had been drinking.

01:11:02.892 --> 01:11:04.928
They realize that you
didn't see anything.

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:09.198
They don't even need your
testimony. We made sure of that.

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:11.000
They're gonna press charges?

01:11:11.067 --> 01:11:14.671
Yes, of course, but you
don't need to be involved.

01:11:14.738 --> 01:11:16.072
But..

01:11:16.139 --> 01:11:17.674
But they..

01:11:17.741 --> 01:11:21.210
They didn't.
We were the ones..

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:26.215
I know you're relieved, honey.
I know. Let it all out.

01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:30.053
Que pasa, homes?

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:31.555
Hey, yo, camera boy.

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:34.691
Say something, boy!
Say something! Pussy.

01:11:34.758 --> 01:11:38.962
Hey, T. Hey, my pops took out an
alligator with this gauge here.

01:11:39.028 --> 01:11:41.030
- He was, like, boom!
- 'For real, dawg.'

01:11:41.097 --> 01:11:43.467
'This is some serious shit.
You get this?'

01:11:43.533 --> 01:11:45.502
It's illegal. You don't
wanna be taking film--

01:11:45.569 --> 01:11:48.204
Son, you better turn
that shit on. You hear me?

01:11:48.271 --> 01:11:50.006
Our life is a
fuckin' film, dawg.

01:11:50.073 --> 01:11:52.041
We a fuckin' film.
You the fuckin' filmmaker.

01:11:52.108 --> 01:11:54.711
We 'bout to mount up.
We 'bout to pay back.

01:11:54.778 --> 01:11:56.946
Ask why you
with the P.L.C, dawg.

01:11:57.013 --> 01:12:01.017
Ain't no 16th Street punks
gonna be corrupting my goddess.

01:12:01.084 --> 01:12:02.819
Yo, I would die for that girl.

01:12:02.886 --> 01:12:06.956
And I will kill for her.
That's my word.

01:12:07.023 --> 01:12:09.959
- This is for you, girl.
- Alright, how do I look? Huh?

01:12:10.026 --> 01:12:13.730
You gonna see me comin' right
up in your fuckin' face, dawg.

01:12:13.797 --> 01:12:16.966
That's right. That's for real,
dawg. That's real.

01:12:17.801 --> 01:12:20.336
[dramatic music]

01:12:49.065 --> 01:12:52.402
- DÃ³nde vas, vato?
- Ain't this Pacific Palisades?

01:12:52.469 --> 01:12:54.738
Nah. Chale, homes.
This is Bel-Air.

01:12:54.804 --> 01:12:56.773
Fuck! Turn around,
turn around. Keep it down.

01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:00.043
- Not in front of the police.
- What do you want me to do?

01:13:00.109 --> 01:13:04.414
None of it really matters. We're
just teenagers and we're bored.

01:13:04.481 --> 01:13:06.516
We are totally..

01:13:06.583 --> 01:13:08.151
...fuckin'..

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:09.753
...bored.

01:13:13.089 --> 01:13:16.125
I remember her.

01:13:16.192 --> 01:13:18.127
I shot something
earlier today.

01:13:18.194 --> 01:13:21.230
That I would love for you
to watch, if you would.

01:13:21.297 --> 01:13:23.567
Um, please sit.

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:33.142
(Toby and friends on TV)
'That's right. That's why
you rollin' with the P.L.C.'

01:13:33.209 --> 01:13:36.780
'Ain't no 16th Street punks
gonna be corrupting my goddess.'

01:13:36.846 --> 01:13:39.015
'Yo, I would die for that girl.'

01:13:39.082 --> 01:13:42.986
'And I will kill for her.
That's my word.'

01:13:43.052 --> 01:13:46.556
'Don't get that twisted, son.
That's fuckin' rape, son.'

01:13:46.623 --> 01:13:50.059
- 'It's fuckin' rape, dawg.'
- Oh, God.

01:13:52.361 --> 01:13:53.830
[phone ringing]

01:13:56.332 --> 01:14:00.136
- Yeah, what's up?
- Toby, what are you thinking?

01:14:00.203 --> 01:14:03.840
- What're you talkin' about?
- The guns, Toby. What the--

01:14:03.907 --> 01:14:07.944
Fuck you, bitch! Don't come
at me telling me what to do.

01:14:08.011 --> 01:14:10.179
Fuckin' bounced your ass
out the P.L.C.

01:14:10.246 --> 01:14:13.983
No, Toby, listen to me.
You don't know what happened.

01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:17.153
- Emily wasn't raped.
- Oh, fuck, you fuckin' liar.

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:20.724
You havin' fun goin' down on
your fuckin' 16th Street pole?

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:21.891
'Bitch!'

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:24.894
Fuck. Toby, just listen
to me, please.

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:28.431
I'm gonna talk to you later.
I'm fuckin' busy.

01:14:28.498 --> 01:14:30.867
Chicken-ass chicken heads.

01:14:32.268 --> 01:14:34.704

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.215
Oh, shit, homes.
It's the jura.

01:14:46.282 --> 01:14:47.517
Chinga!

01:14:47.584 --> 01:14:49.553
Why are you here
in the first place?

01:14:49.619 --> 01:14:52.421
- We're driving to the beach.
- The beach?

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:54.223
- We're going home now.
- And where's home?

01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:57.260
- East Los.
- Know how to get out of here?

01:14:57.326 --> 01:15:00.063
- Chale, we're lost.
-Homes, you got lost.

01:15:00.129 --> 01:15:02.265
Well, we can help you out
with that.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.834
I don't ever wanna see you
in this neighborhood again.

01:15:04.901 --> 01:15:07.036
- Ã“rale .
- Alright.

01:15:08.371 --> 01:15:10.940
(Emily)
'I just don't wanna
see anybody right now.'

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:13.777
(Mr. Rubin)
'We'll go to Sun Valley
for couple of weeks'

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:15.444
'and don't worry about it.'

01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:16.946
- Deal?
- Okay.

01:15:17.013 --> 01:15:18.548
Em?

01:15:20.283 --> 01:15:24.821
Oh, Alli, y-you've always been
a friend in our house.

01:15:24.888 --> 01:15:28.925
It's not that we don't love you,
I think we need a little break.

01:15:32.128 --> 01:15:34.263
You didn't tell them
about the dice?

01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:35.699
Alli, don't.

01:15:35.765 --> 01:15:38.935
Emily, Toby, Nick, and Sam
are going downtown right now

01:15:39.002 --> 01:15:42.371
for revenge,
to defend your honor.

01:15:42.438 --> 01:15:44.273
We asked if..

01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:50.313
I asked if we could be in those
guys from East L.A.'s crew.

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:51.681
- If we could--
- Shut up!

01:15:51.748 --> 01:15:54.083
No, no, no.
What? You did what?

01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:58.421
The way to do that
was by rolling dice.

01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:01.958
Then you, um..

01:16:02.025 --> 01:16:04.293
...you sleep with
whatever number comes up.

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.429
Oh, no.

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:07.797
(Mr. Rubin)
'Do what?'

01:16:07.864 --> 01:16:10.734
- Dad.
- It's their initiation thing.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.736
We asked for it.

01:16:12.802 --> 01:16:15.204
We asked if we could join
and then we went

01:16:15.271 --> 01:16:19.643
into the other room
with them on our own.

01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:21.778
- It was our decision.
- I hate you.

01:16:21.845 --> 01:16:24.347
I can never be
your friend again.

01:16:49.472 --> 01:16:53.643
Em? Come on. Em?

01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:57.280
- 'Em?'
- Why don't you just fuck off?

01:16:59.649 --> 01:17:01.818
Come on. Don't be like that.

01:17:01.885 --> 01:17:03.820
Why not, Alli?

01:17:03.887 --> 01:17:05.588
Do you want
to spend the night again?

01:17:05.655 --> 01:17:10.694
'Do you want to go on vacation
with us? Is that what it is?'

01:17:14.831 --> 01:17:17.266
I'm sorry.

01:17:17.333 --> 01:17:21.437
The one fucking time
I really, really needed you..

01:17:21.504 --> 01:17:24.040
...and you didn't have my back.

01:17:25.441 --> 01:17:30.046
What? No. Em, come on.
It's not like that.

01:17:30.113 --> 01:17:32.315
No, that's exactly
what it's like.

01:17:33.416 --> 01:17:35.418
Get on the fucking ground!

I swear to fucking God!
What the fuck's she saying?!

01:17:53.136 --> 01:17:55.071
She's saying, "please
don't hurt my baby."

01:17:55.138 --> 01:18:00.009
- Are you fuckin' serious?
- "Please don't hurt my baby."

Ah.

01:18:26.102 --> 01:18:28.037
Are you using a razor?

01:18:28.104 --> 01:18:30.206
- Aah!
- 'Razors really hurt.'

up your wrists for a week.

Emily, do you have a gun?

No. It's okay.
I'm taking a bath.

01:18:42.585 --> 01:18:45.855
Well, you could try taking
sleeping pills, but you don't

01:18:45.922 --> 01:18:48.491
have enough to kill yourself
so you're gonna be in the

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:51.094

to remember is that..

Well, none of it really matters.

01:21:44.267 --> 01:21:46.435
* Straight up the block
with that Glock cocked *

01:21:46.502 --> 01:21:48.371
* From the school
of hard knocks *

01:21:48.437 --> 01:21:50.606
* Sellin' rocks, duckin' cops,
raisin' hell *

01:21:50.673 --> 01:21:53.242
* It's on, like Run-D.M.C.
but with automatics *

01:21:53.309 --> 01:21:55.211
* You want some static,
can't top that *

01:21:55.278 --> 01:21:56.645
* Welcome to havoc

01:21:56.712 --> 01:21:58.481
* Straight up the block
with that Glock cocked *

01:21:58.547 --> 01:22:00.416
* From the school
of hard knocks *

01:22:00.483 --> 01:22:02.251
* Sellin' rocks, duckin' cops,
raisin' hell *

01:22:02.318 --> 01:22:05.088
* It's on, like Run-D.M.C.
but with automatics *

01:22:05.154 --> 01:22:07.523
* You want some static,
can't top that *

01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:08.958
* Welcome to havoc

01:22:09.025 --> 01:22:10.893
* Look, don't even
bring it my way *

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:14.430
* It's like gettin' an atheist
to pay tithes on a Sunday *

01:22:14.497 --> 01:22:17.366
* A waste of time,
a wasted mind *

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:20.536
* Found a side from the waist
to raise the nine *

01:22:20.603 --> 01:22:23.239
* See, I'll make your soul
rise and shine *

01:22:23.306 --> 01:22:26.209
* In the middle of the night
and go towards that light *

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:27.410
* Runnin' towards that light

01:22:27.476 --> 01:22:29.412
* In the coupe looking right

01:22:29.478 --> 01:22:32.281
* How you in your afterlife,
lookin' back in hindsight *

01:22:32.348 --> 01:22:34.917
* Here, nigga,
you got that iffy flow *

01:22:34.984 --> 01:22:38.654
* If he flow a little better,
he might make a little dough *

01:22:38.721 --> 01:22:41.157
* I'm a businessman,
fuck a rap star *

01:22:41.224 --> 01:22:42.691
* What's the point
of sellin' millions *

01:22:42.758 --> 01:22:44.793
* If you got to rent a car

01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:47.030
* Nah, it's the bishop
no not the deacon *

01:22:47.096 --> 01:22:50.199
* I've been this way since
Doc Dre was rockin' sequins *

01:22:50.266 --> 01:22:53.402
* Bad for the cause and
the thugs, why they beefin' *

01:22:53.469 --> 01:22:56.339
* Bustin' them slugs,
and niggas die every weekend *

01:22:56.405 --> 01:22:58.307
