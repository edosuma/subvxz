00:00.635 --> 00:02.234
Previously, on Genius...

00:03.237 --> 00:04.569
You are a genius, Maya.

00:04.606 --> 00:05.638
Come here.

00:05.773 --> 00:07.456
You have children,
women you love.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.658
Some things are more
important than art.

00:09.661 --> 00:11.627
Not to me.

00:11.763 --> 00:12.962
Pablo?

00:12.964 --> 00:14.964
You must be Marie-Thérèse.

00:14.966 --> 00:16.799
The mother of his child, the
woman he is going to marry.

00:16.801 --> 00:19.602
Perhaps you should pay a visit
to his wife and inform her of

00:19.604 --> 00:21.737
this... expectation.

00:21.973 --> 00:24.457
Pablo Picasso,
meet Henri Matisse.

00:24.792 --> 00:28.760
40 years on, and the great Henri
Matisse is still trying to outdo me.

00:30.798 --> 00:33.999
As artists, we must demand
nothing less than the perpetual,

00:34.068 --> 00:36.936
immoral subversion of
the existing order.

00:37.939 --> 00:39.771
I hope she makes you happy.

00:39.807 --> 00:43.459
You will get married, and you will
have a family but not with me.

00:43.845 --> 00:45.361
I'm about to
leave for The Front.

00:45.363 --> 00:47.029
I was hoping you would
paint my portrait?

00:47.164 --> 00:48.730
The woman I love is dying.

00:48.766 --> 00:50.646
You think I want to paint
your goddamn portrait?

00:50.768 --> 00:52.868
Maybe I should be a soldier.

00:52.904 --> 00:55.805
Well, then you will be general, and
if you're a priest, you will be pope.

00:56.474 --> 00:57.857
I had a vision.

00:57.859 --> 00:59.191
Jesus appeared to me.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.793
I want you to
stay away from Picasso.

01:00.862 --> 01:02.127
Stop!

01:02.196 --> 01:03.863
I have missed you, terribly.

01:03.865 --> 01:05.731
I only want you, Françoise.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.333
Let's make a baby.

01:07.335 --> 01:08.945
You were the one
who wanted children, Pablo,

01:08.969 --> 01:10.569
but I didn't agree
to give up my work,

01:10.605 --> 01:12.838
so I could
cater to all your needs.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074

02:03.140 --> 02:06.592
Monsieur Picasso, Jean Cocteau.

02:07.929 --> 02:10.848
I once asked you to paint my portrait,
but it was a terrible time for you.

02:11.399 --> 02:15.201
Listen, I know how fond you are of
painting harlequins, so I thought...

02:18.740 --> 02:22.925
well, um...

02:29.200 --> 02:31.166
Cocteau has asked
me to design a ballet.

02:31.202 --> 02:32.701
Sets, costumes, all of it.

02:32.770 --> 02:34.503
Do you know
much about the ballet?

02:34.638 --> 02:37.239
No, but that is
exactly why I'm drawn to it.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.559
A chance to work in a new medium,
Rosi and I won't be doing it alone.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.929
Cocteau will be
writing the scenario.

02:44.064 --> 02:46.198
He's brilliant.
Satie is composing.

02:46.234 --> 02:47.867
Diaghilev's company
will be dancing...

02:47.869 --> 02:50.402
You don't enjoy
sharing the footlights, Pablo.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.590
I worked with
Braque for years, didn't I?

02:56.160 --> 02:58.494
His eyesight has returned.

02:58.496 --> 02:59.795
Make peace with him.

02:59.797 --> 03:01.197
Make some art with him.

03:01.332 --> 03:03.065
Braque wants
nothing to do with me,

03:03.167 --> 03:05.367
and even if he did,
I'm bored with Cubism.

03:05.436 --> 03:06.635
It's too easy for me.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.570
There's no satisfaction
in it any more.

03:08.639 --> 03:11.390
So instead you want to sew
tutus and paint backdrops?

03:11.525 --> 03:13.526
It's much more than that, Rosi.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.260
Imagine...

03:15.296 --> 03:17.696
instead of depicting multiple
perspectives on a flat surface,

03:18.465 --> 03:21.466
I can make a painting that
actually moves, breathes,

03:21.836 --> 03:23.969
keeps turning into
another painting.

03:23.971 --> 03:27.623
Clever, but for a painting to sell,
it only needs one discerning buyer.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.994
For a ballet to be a success, it
must be admired by the masses.

03:32.430 --> 03:35.664
They may not understand
what you're trying to do.

03:35.666 --> 03:37.833
They never do, not at first.

03:40.037 --> 03:43.639
This war is
going to be over soon, Pablo.

03:43.641 --> 03:46.158
The people are going
to start buying again.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.794
And if you spent the next few
months creating some inventory,

03:50.298 --> 03:51.963
we could make real money.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.498
"Inventory?"

03:53.568 --> 03:54.900
I do not work in a factory...

03:55.035 --> 03:56.735
Of course not.
It's a figure of speech...

03:56.871 --> 04:00.372
And I do not need money.

04:01.392 --> 04:04.426
I need a new challenge.

04:05.062 --> 04:11.366
And one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight and one...

04:11.903 --> 04:14.236
I'm still struggling
with shape and movement,

04:14.371 --> 04:16.171
but once I spend more
time with the music,

04:16.240 --> 04:18.290
experimenting with
materials, watching rehearsals.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.625
Um, it goes like this.

04:21.428 --> 04:24.730
It looks like a man wearing...

04:25.466 --> 04:26.565
a building.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.300
Exactly.

04:28.302 --> 04:30.314
Picasso wants to tear down the
walls between, set and costume,

04:30.338 --> 04:32.538
between onstage and backstage.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.184
And one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

04:34.208 --> 04:36.224
Between reason and insanity?

04:36.294 --> 04:39.895
Well, it will certainly
shake the establishment...

04:44.435 --> 04:46.901
Olga Khokhlova.

04:47.972 --> 04:51.090
Your eye's as good as your reputation
would suggest, Monsieur Picasso.

04:52.226 --> 04:53.992
She's so elegant.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.462
Yes, I have high hopes for her.

04:56.597 --> 05:00.199
Well, I look forward to
seeing what you dream up next.

05:05.005 --> 05:08.290
One, two threee four,
five, six, seven and eight.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.225
One, two, three...

05:10.227 --> 05:13.361
Pablo, don't waste your time.

05:13.397 --> 05:16.598
Why not?

05:16.601 --> 05:18.767
Russian aristocracy.

05:18.803 --> 05:21.370
She must be looking
for a duke or a viscount,

05:21.706 --> 05:25.090
not a controversial
Spanish painter?

05:27.795 --> 05:32.298
And one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

05:38.205 --> 05:40.085
You have much better
lines than the lead dancer.

05:41.559 --> 05:43.091
Do not let her
hear you say that.

05:43.127 --> 05:45.027
Why not? It's the truth.

05:45.096 --> 05:48.130
Stagehands who critique dancers may
find themselves painting scenery

05:48.265 --> 05:49.798
at the burlesque in Naples.

05:49.867 --> 05:51.566
I like the burlesque.

05:51.669 --> 05:54.837
Well, I am sure you must return
to work on this abstract fiasco.

05:54.839 --> 05:56.105
You don't like the designs?

05:56.240 --> 05:57.305
No, not at all.

05:57.341 --> 05:59.024
Now, if you'll excuse me.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.193
Mademoiselle Khokhlova, I see
you've met our designer,

06:01.195 --> 06:03.996
the great Pablo Picasso.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.735
It seems Monsieur Picasso was
too modest to mention that.

06:11.072 --> 06:13.872
I can assure you there is nothing
modest about Pablo Picasso.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.425
Pablo, come with me.

06:16.560 --> 06:19.205
I need you to help me persuade Satie that
a typewriter and a pistol must be added

06:19.229 --> 06:20.240
to the percussion section.

06:20.264 --> 06:22.197
Satie will have to wait.

06:22.266 --> 06:25.000
I promised to escort Mademoiselle
Khokhlova back to her hotel.

06:28.806 --> 06:32.457
I had to be measured
for my costume today.

06:32.493 --> 06:35.193
Apparently you intend to
dress me in cardboard.

06:37.665 --> 06:40.132
Have you not had
enough of pink tutus?

06:42.003 --> 06:44.470
I prefer classical
art to little boxes.

06:46.107 --> 06:48.490
So you do know cubism.

06:49.427 --> 06:54.697
Yes, and I know the cancan as
well, but I dance in the ballet.

07:02.640 --> 07:05.090
I want to paint you.

07:05.126 --> 07:07.826
I suppose Parisian women
find that offer irresistible.

07:10.031 --> 07:11.463
Usually.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.599
Thank you for the
escort, and good night.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.737
You are not going to make
this easy for me, are you?

07:20.274 --> 07:22.524
No, Monsieur Picasso, I'm not.

07:30.301 --> 07:32.233
I thought you had
forgotten me entirely.

07:32.503 --> 07:34.136
Nonsense.

07:34.205 --> 07:35.938
I would never miss
one of our lunches.

07:36.407 --> 07:37.790
Please, yes.

07:37.925 --> 07:40.525
Yes, I suppose
I should be grateful.

07:40.594 --> 07:43.295
You do give me your undivided
attention, once a week, for an hour.

07:44.031 --> 07:47.165
Olga,
please, let's just enjoy...

07:49.937 --> 07:52.371
I saw you in that
horrid Life Magazine...

07:52.373 --> 07:53.373
with her.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.456
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

07:55.493 --> 07:58.594
I can't help it if the press insists on
publishing all these stories in the...

07:58.596 --> 08:01.797
First that stupid girl, then that
insane photographer, and now...

08:01.866 --> 08:04.166
you leave me to
rot in a dingy hotel.

08:04.635 --> 08:07.603
It's the best hotel in Paris.

08:07.605 --> 08:10.317
While you cavort for all the world
to see with your latest mistress and

08:10.341 --> 08:12.590
her two urchins.

08:12.626 --> 08:15.094
You mean my children.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.963
What about our son?

08:18.999 --> 08:21.600
When was the last
time you saw him?

08:23.104 --> 08:24.837
I see Paulo when I can.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.938
He's a grown man who
doesn't want to be around...

08:27.374 --> 08:29.992
Yes, with a wife
and a child of his own.

08:30.461 --> 08:32.393
We are your family too, Pablo.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.530
Of course you are, of course.

08:35.866 --> 08:41.102
Olga, please, don't cry okay?

08:42.472 --> 08:44.857
Please, please, don't cry.

08:44.992 --> 08:47.659
Don't cry, please.

08:49.497 --> 08:52.197
You are still my wife.

08:54.368 --> 08:58.937
The only Madame Picasso, nothing,
nothing will ever change that.

09:03.394 --> 09:07.863
But we'll never go back to the
way things were, will we?

09:15.039 --> 09:17.039
Whore!

09:18.058 --> 09:21.159
Claude, come. Let's go home.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.962
Stay away from him!

09:24.048 --> 09:26.865
Do you hear me?

09:26.867 --> 09:29.668
He's my husband, not yours!

09:29.670 --> 09:31.003
Pablo.

09:31.005 --> 09:32.871
Olga followed me
again, screaming at me.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.923
It terrified the children.

09:35.058 --> 09:37.459
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.

09:39.663 --> 09:41.396
You know that she is not well.

09:41.398 --> 09:44.132
I don't understand why you
let these women hang on.

09:44.168 --> 09:47.369
Well, they are part of my life.

09:47.371 --> 09:49.003
I can't just cut them out.

09:49.039 --> 09:51.005
So instead you run
back and forth between them...

09:51.041 --> 09:54.025
give each one of them just enough so
she feels she's the most important.

09:54.061 --> 09:57.196
I try to keep them
separate, make things easy.

09:57.331 --> 09:58.730
You know? To avoid confusion.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.198
Do you understand?

10:00.201 --> 10:01.611
There is nothing
easy about this, Pablo.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.735
Nothing.

10:03.771 --> 10:06.383
And Olga, for one, seems to be very confused
about it, and I can't take it anymore...

10:06.407 --> 10:08.323
not with two little ones.

10:08.392 --> 10:10.325
We'll go away from the city.

10:10.394 --> 10:12.027
We'll go to the
beach, away from Olga.

10:20.971 --> 10:23.411
How many of the other dancers in
the company have sat for you?

10:24.508 --> 10:25.957
You want the truth?

10:25.960 --> 10:27.893
Certainly.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.595
No one actually
sits for me anymore.

10:30.598 --> 10:32.331
Because you
only do abstractions.

10:32.333 --> 10:34.132
Because I work from memory.

10:34.268 --> 10:37.236
The moment I saw the curve of your
neck, the color of your cheek,

10:39.072 --> 10:41.790
your face was etched in my mind.

10:42.326 --> 10:46.127
Then why am I
frozen here with a stiff back?

10:47.264 --> 10:50.365
Would you have agreed to spend
time with me otherwise?

11:01.628 --> 11:05.264
It seems you can do more
than little cubes after all.

11:12.973 --> 11:17.259
Um, I'm afraid you've mistaken
my compliment for an invitation.

11:20.664 --> 11:23.465
If you want me to go, say so.

11:46.540 --> 11:49.791
No, Monsieur,
I cannot let you in.

11:51.194 --> 11:54.195
Why not?

11:54.264 --> 11:57.265
We are not married.

12:20.274 --> 12:22.857
You are not his wife!

12:23.326 --> 12:24.860
You followed us here?

12:24.862 --> 12:26.794
This was our beach.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.529
No.

12:28.565 --> 12:31.077
Did you think I wouldn't find out,
as if I have no friends here?

12:31.101 --> 12:33.035
I am the only Madame Picasso!

12:37.174 --> 12:38.724
Hey, Olga!

12:40.461 --> 12:42.527
Olga, what are you doing here?

12:44.031 --> 12:46.531
I have more right than she does!

12:46.666 --> 12:48.266
Come on, come, come.

12:48.302 --> 12:49.601
Hey, hey!

12:49.736 --> 12:50.880
Françoise, where are you
going, where are you going?

12:50.904 --> 12:52.871
Claude, Claude, Claude!

12:52.873 --> 12:54.889
Please, Olga, please go.

12:54.958 --> 12:57.926
Go, please, please.

12:57.928 --> 12:59.261
Yeah?

12:59.263 --> 13:00.263
Go.

13:00.397 --> 13:02.998
Yeah.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.904
They are soldiers.

13:59.940 --> 14:03.792
They wanted cleavage and bare legs,
and we are giving them men in boxes.

14:27.935 --> 14:30.635
My brothers!

14:30.971 --> 14:33.572
Respect for our art is
respect for our country.

14:37.461 --> 14:39.861
My brothers, please.

14:42.332 --> 14:44.332
I have never been so humiliated.

14:44.368 --> 14:46.334
Did you hear them?

14:46.803 --> 14:48.403
Art is meant to provoke.

14:48.405 --> 14:49.816
It means we made
them feel something.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.656
Yes, loathing.

14:51.825 --> 14:54.392
When I painted "Les Demoiselles"
10 years ago, everyone hated it.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.994
Now everyone copies my style.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.462
My body isn't a canvas.

14:57.531 --> 14:59.197
It won't last 10 years.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.826
And now I have let you turn me
into a puppet to display your art.

15:03.537 --> 15:06.338
I understand why she is embarrassed,
but one day she will realize that she

15:06.340 --> 15:07.738
was part of a new movement.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.824
Yes, what did you,
call it, Guillaume?

15:09.960 --> 15:11.092
Surrealism.

15:11.161 --> 15:13.595
Surrealism. Ha!
What a wonderful word.

15:14.398 --> 15:16.064
Thank you for
quieting the crowd.

15:16.199 --> 15:18.199
The least I could do.

15:18.235 --> 15:19.533
Don't worry about Olga.

15:19.570 --> 15:21.269
We will cheer her up.

15:21.305 --> 15:23.138
We are organizing a party.

15:23.273 --> 15:26.457
Diaghilev is hosting a dinner for
the company, with the Marchesa.

15:26.894 --> 15:28.593
Olga feels it's
important we attend.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.194
Well, of course.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.395
Of course.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.598
Hey, you mustn't
disappoint the Marchesa.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.166
Dinner next week, then.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.346
We can't wait to meet the woman
who has stolen your heart.

15:37.370 --> 15:40.290
Olga's eager to meet you too, but the
company leaves for Madrid on Monday.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.257
Well, the three of us then.

15:42.359 --> 15:45.360
At the Lapin Agile,
like old times.

15:45.362 --> 15:48.062
I'm going with her.

15:48.098 --> 15:51.499
Well, she certainly
has you under her spell.

15:53.937 --> 15:56.738
She's like no
woman I have ever met.

15:56.873 --> 15:59.324
She's refined and elegant.

15:59.393 --> 16:00.858
Challenging.

16:00.894 --> 16:02.193
Pure.

16:02.329 --> 16:03.595
She's saved herself
for marriage.

16:03.597 --> 16:05.330
Can you imagine?

16:05.332 --> 16:07.098
So then you're going to?

16:07.134 --> 16:10.902
If she'll have me, yes.

16:11.605 --> 16:14.405
I want her to be the
mother of my children.

16:14.741 --> 16:18.026
Damn, Paulo.
What were you thinking?

16:18.295 --> 16:20.061
There was whiskey, Papa.

16:20.097 --> 16:22.442
Someone brought a few women to the
room, and the next thing I knew,

16:22.466 --> 16:23.665
the police were at the door.

16:23.800 --> 16:26.534
You are 28 years
old, for God's sake.

16:26.603 --> 16:29.204
How could you be drunk in public
with a wife and son at home?

16:30.473 --> 16:33.353
You of all people are going to lecture
me about being a faithful husband?

16:35.162 --> 16:37.996
I should have
let you rot in jail.

16:38.632 --> 16:40.731
You know what, Papa?

16:40.767 --> 16:43.067
I'll make it easy for you.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.636
Just forget about me...

16:45.806 --> 16:47.305
Maman, too.

16:47.307 --> 16:51.192
Wait, you already have.

16:56.633 --> 16:58.065
He needs you.

16:58.101 --> 17:01.336
What more can I do?

17:01.338 --> 17:03.338
I already pay for his life.

17:03.340 --> 17:06.257
Your money may take care of him,
but he doesn't feel cared for.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.527
I want Claude and Paloma to
know the rest of their family.

17:10.998 --> 17:13.064
Yeah, of course.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.199
Let's have a big party,
invite them all...

17:15.569 --> 17:16.701
Olga too, everybody.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.170
No, Olga, no, but...

17:20.240 --> 17:22.021
Marie-Thérèse and
Maya should come.

17:22.025 --> 17:23.525
You can't be serious.

17:23.527 --> 17:25.626
Maya doesn't know anything
about you or the children.

17:25.695 --> 17:30.198
Would you rather she learned
the truth from some magazine?

17:30.801 --> 17:32.667
Sit up straight, Maya.

17:32.669 --> 17:33.801
Sorry, Maman.

17:33.837 --> 17:36.304
It's okay.

17:38.659 --> 17:40.225
It's nonsense.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.532
Maya, would you
like to hold your sister?

17:47.667 --> 17:49.300
Half-sister and I am not...

17:49.369 --> 17:50.968
What a wonderful idea!

17:51.071 --> 17:53.738
My two beauties, together.

17:55.359 --> 17:57.926
Paloma, this is Maya.

17:59.295 --> 18:01.362
She's so tiny!

18:01.365 --> 18:03.664
She's not nearly as big as
Pablito, right Emilienne?

18:03.700 --> 18:06.134
No, and Pablito
is three weeks younger.

18:07.437 --> 18:10.305
So Pablito is my nephew?

18:11.608 --> 18:13.525
Yes, he's...

18:13.660 --> 18:16.094
He's your brother Paulo's son.

18:17.064 --> 18:21.399
And Claude is my brother, too?

18:22.869 --> 18:24.169
Half-brother.

18:24.304 --> 18:27.205
Yes, from your
father's new family.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.457
The one that took your
place after you took mine.

18:35.732 --> 18:39.067
Give the baby back now, Maya.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.737
This is my favorite paso doble.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.194
Ven aqui, ven aqui.

19:18.275 --> 19:19.924
Your Maya is lovely.

19:20.059 --> 19:21.792
You've done a superb
job raising her.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.429
And your babies are lovely.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.734
But you'll never
replace me, Françoise.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.637
I'm not
trying to, Marie-Thérèse.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.791
This is for the children.

19:47.037 --> 19:49.537
I loved having you here.

19:51.992 --> 19:53.257
What's wrong?

19:53.293 --> 19:55.125
I thought you enjoyed yourself.

19:55.162 --> 19:59.597
You played with the
babies, we danced.

19:59.599 --> 20:02.133
I had fun, Papa.

20:02.135 --> 20:04.068
It's just...

20:04.204 --> 20:07.972
I always thought you
left us for your work,

20:08.174 --> 20:11.626
not because you lived
with another family.

20:20.904 --> 20:23.438
Why must you make
things so difficult, Pablo.

20:23.573 --> 20:25.623
These are supposed
to be our easy years.

20:25.992 --> 20:28.126
Tell that to Françoise.

20:31.965 --> 20:35.834
My life was orderly,
exactly as I wanted it.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.603
She has turned it into chaos.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.439
You should enjoy your
children and grandchildren.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.090
Embrace the chaos.

20:43.126 --> 20:45.627
How am I supposed to work
with all these distractions?

20:46.796 --> 20:49.197
You might not
do a retrospective?

20:50.834 --> 20:54.669
The curators have been circling like
vultures, as if I'm already dead,

20:55.972 --> 20:58.756
but there's so much
more still to do, Henri.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.427
This...

21:02.429 --> 21:04.428
This American fellow,
Jackson Pollock.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.431
He has set the
art world on fire.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.833
Paint splattered on canvas.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.869
Abstraction for the
sake of abstraction.

21:11.004 --> 21:15.690
I can't say I understand it either,
but nobody understood my colors

21:15.759 --> 21:19.494
at first, or Cubism, or collage.

21:20.296 --> 21:24.798
Maybe this Pollock sees
something we don't, or can't.

21:26.403 --> 21:28.703
Well, we are
still the revolution.

21:28.772 --> 21:30.838
He's just following it.

21:30.840 --> 21:34.192
Yes, but that is what Monet and Degas
probably thought about us, no?

21:36.863 --> 21:39.831
Nothing can take away from
what we have achieved, Pablo.

21:41.134 --> 21:47.906
Nothing, but we should be,
embracing the new guard,

21:48.958 --> 21:52.360
not competing with them.

21:52.829 --> 21:56.631
That may work
for you but not for me.

21:58.435 --> 22:00.702
I am not dead yet.

22:01.171 --> 22:03.971
Not now, Pablo.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.824
The children are
coming for lunch.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.192
Make yourself useful.

22:08.328 --> 22:11.763
The chicken is almost done.

22:13.600 --> 22:16.401
Chicken?

22:16.937 --> 22:19.971
I want to make love and
and you send me for chicken?

22:23.259 --> 22:25.626
The world does not always
operate on your schedule.

22:27.430 --> 22:30.398
Just tell me the
truth, Françoise.

22:30.800 --> 22:36.503
You keep coming up with reasons to have
people around so you don't have to spend

22:36.806 --> 22:39.824
time alone with me.

22:41.527 --> 22:46.063
You have lost interest
in me, because I'm old.

22:46.333 --> 22:48.265
I'm trying to make
things better for everyone.

22:48.335 --> 22:50.200
But how, how is it better?

22:50.236 --> 22:54.639
Do you think Paulo wants to watch
me playing cowboys with Claude when

22:54.641 --> 22:57.558
he remembers I sent him
off to boarding school?

22:57.560 --> 23:00.294
Do you think Maya wants to
watch me cuddling Paloma.

23:00.930 --> 23:03.397
Maya loves Paloma...

23:03.633 --> 23:04.832
I'm going to Paris.

23:04.901 --> 23:06.167
You can't go to Paris.

23:06.236 --> 23:07.702
Yes, I can.

23:09.239 --> 23:10.883
It's too difficult to work
with all these distractions.

23:10.907 --> 23:13.992
What am I
supposed to tell everyone?

23:15.928 --> 23:17.929
Emilienne says Paulo
is drinking less.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.463
He's desperate to please you.

23:19.532 --> 23:21.332
He's trying to find a job.

23:21.401 --> 23:24.035
Hire him to help you catalogue
my work, for my retrospective.

23:25.372 --> 23:26.652
I thought
you'd decided not to...

23:26.706 --> 23:28.639
Yeah.

23:28.692 --> 23:31.103
You know, Matisse has convinced me that,
it would be a good idea to remind

23:31.127 --> 23:34.896
the critics that my work is still
the most important in the world.

23:35.532 --> 23:39.400
Nobody needs to be reminded how
brilliant you are, Pablo, believe me.

23:42.371 --> 23:44.104
Now, please, at least
stay for lunch...

23:44.140 --> 23:47.524
No. You, you made this
mess, you deal with it!

23:47.560 --> 23:51.195
There. Adios.

24:05.361 --> 24:07.361
Diaghilev is bringing his
Russian ballet to Madrid,

24:07.931 --> 24:09.630
but they are not
performing Parade.

24:09.666 --> 24:12.733
It caused
quite a scandal in Paris.

24:12.802 --> 24:15.837
Perhaps, but Pablo Picasso
is a son of Spain.

24:15.972 --> 24:18.706
His own people deserve
to see his work.

24:22.395 --> 24:24.228
Summon the Minister of the Arts.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.630
Yes, your majesty.

24:27.100 --> 24:29.099
It's a ballet, Victoria.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.602
How offensive can it be?

24:41.297 --> 24:43.798
Every director dreams of a
command performance for a king.

24:45.635 --> 24:49.137
If he hates it, I will be a called
fool and a fraud in my own country.

24:51.341 --> 24:53.491
Well, let's hope
the king likes horses.

26:16.659 --> 26:18.326
Pi-ca-sso!

26:18.928 --> 26:20.127
Pi-ca-sso!

26:20.529 --> 26:22.430
Pi-ca-sso...

26:28.238 --> 26:31.472
Engaged! How wonderful!

26:31.474 --> 26:33.190
And such a beauty.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.758
Thank you, Madame Picasso.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.027
Madame Picasso?

26:36.162 --> 26:38.729
Nonsense, I am Mama.

26:38.798 --> 26:41.064
You should rest your ankle.

26:41.601 --> 26:43.334
Olga irritated an old injury.

26:43.469 --> 26:45.870
Well, you won't
have to worry about that now.

26:46.005 --> 26:48.405
Of course carrying babies can
put on a strain on your ankles.

26:49.458 --> 26:52.125
To think that this time next
year, I could be a grandmother.

26:53.396 --> 26:56.564
By this time next year, I hope to be
the principal dancer in the company.

26:59.102 --> 27:00.634
Does Olga even want children?

27:00.670 --> 27:04.271
Of course, but she's
not ready to give up dancing.

27:04.340 --> 27:06.456
And why should you have to wait?

27:06.492 --> 27:09.560
Because I love her.

27:09.796 --> 27:12.530
Well, when you marry, there
are sacrifices, yes.

27:12.665 --> 27:15.333
But you should not be
the one to make them.

27:16.002 --> 27:18.536
You deserve a wife that
will always put you first.

27:19.539 --> 27:22.390
Will Olga do that?

27:36.673 --> 27:38.956
To Monsieur and Madame Picasso.

27:39.058 --> 27:40.290
Santé.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.260
Santé. Santé.

27:46.032 --> 27:51.102
My, profound condolences to the women
of Paris who will no doubt shed

27:52.272 --> 27:55.656
many a tear now that their club has
lost its most prominent member.

27:57.793 --> 27:59.860
Well, it has been a long day.

27:59.929 --> 28:02.330
And a strange one.

28:02.465 --> 28:06.567
What could be more shocking than our
Pablo settling down with one woman?

28:07.437 --> 28:09.503
I mean, however
beautiful she may be?

28:13.293 --> 28:16.794
Max made it sound as if you have
made love to every woman in Paris.

28:18.197 --> 28:21.365
Max was drunk,
trying to get a laugh.

28:21.434 --> 28:24.368
Don't pay him any mind.

28:24.570 --> 28:26.770
I want to know.

28:26.806 --> 28:29.857
How many have there been?

28:32.362 --> 28:36.897
How many others, dozens, more?

28:46.859 --> 28:51.195
I saved myself for you.

28:52.198 --> 28:58.269
Yes, and I have
waited my whole life for you.

29:03.693 --> 29:05.225
I chose you.

29:05.294 --> 29:08.095
I gave you my name.

29:08.230 --> 29:11.966
You are the only Madame Picasso.

29:36.358 --> 29:38.025
Is Monsieur Picasso at home?

29:38.094 --> 29:39.693
Who shall I say is calling?

29:39.729 --> 29:41.161
Genevieve Laporte.

29:41.197 --> 29:42.963
I don't remember her.

29:42.965 --> 29:45.833
Apparently she once interviewed
you for her school paper,

29:46.636 --> 29:49.870
and you invited her to come see you
the next time she was in Paris.

29:49.872 --> 29:51.972
So she's a student?

29:52.041 --> 29:54.125
Not anymore.

30:11.194 --> 30:12.993
She's captivating.

30:13.129 --> 30:15.596
Do you know when he painted it?

30:15.665 --> 30:17.397
He didn't.

30:17.433 --> 30:20.468
I did, years ago.

30:23.172 --> 30:25.105
I had no idea
you were so talented.

30:25.141 --> 30:27.558
Kahnweiler's been asking
me for new work to show,

30:27.627 --> 30:30.627
and I just don't have
the time anymore.

30:30.963 --> 30:32.863
Who is she?

30:32.932 --> 30:35.065
My grandmother.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.434
She's not been well, actually.

30:37.470 --> 30:39.102
I should go see her.

30:39.172 --> 30:40.571
Why don't you?

30:40.640 --> 30:43.490
I'd be happy to
finish here on my own.

30:43.493 --> 30:47.194
Paulo, I appreciate that, but...

30:47.663 --> 30:49.463
It's the least I can do.

30:49.465 --> 30:52.833
You didn't owe any of us
kindness, but here we are.

30:54.870 --> 30:57.338
I'm afraid my meddling
drove your father away.

30:59.225 --> 31:01.425
It has nothing to do with you.

31:01.427 --> 31:04.929
He just does what
he wants, always.

31:05.064 --> 31:06.997
So do what you want.

31:06.999 --> 31:08.599
Go see your grandmother.

31:08.601 --> 31:12.303
What if he comes
home and I'm not here?

31:12.505 --> 31:15.306
I've not seen him in weeks.

31:15.441 --> 31:16.921
I'm a bit worried
about him, actually.

31:16.993 --> 31:19.393
He loves you, Françoise.

31:19.528 --> 31:23.531
I know he does, but do you think
he's in Paris worrying about you?

31:38.264 --> 31:41.198
Should you answer that?

31:42.668 --> 31:45.669
Whatever it is, it can wait.

31:50.226 --> 31:53.761
And how long do
you plan to keep me waiting?

31:57.833 --> 32:00.400
I beg your pardon?

32:00.469 --> 32:02.702
God.

32:02.738 --> 32:06.218
I thought when you told me to come back, I
thought you meant when I was old enough to...

32:08.094 --> 32:10.594
I'm so sorry and so naive.

32:10.596 --> 32:13.063
Apparently I
am the one who is naive.

32:13.198 --> 32:16.567
You're so young
and so beautiful.

32:16.569 --> 32:21.105
It didn't occur to me that you
were interested in an old man.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.457
You don't seem old to me.

33:08.537 --> 33:11.071
Rosi, say hello to Coco Chanel.

33:11.140 --> 33:13.290
Coco, this is Paul Rosenberg,
my dealer.

33:13.693 --> 33:15.025
A pleasure, Mademoiselle.

33:15.027 --> 33:18.362
My wife is a great
admirer of your designs.

33:18.431 --> 33:19.747
Well, Monsieur Rosenberg,

33:19.865 --> 33:22.132
it seems your wife
is not cheap, is she?

33:23.369 --> 33:24.568
Indeed.

33:24.637 --> 33:26.170
Which reminds me, Pablo...

33:26.172 --> 33:29.239
Ever since Margot saw Olga's
portrait, she will not relent.

33:29.241 --> 33:32.259
She is insisting I commission
you to paint her as well.

33:32.862 --> 33:36.596
Yes, in the classical style,
just as you painted Olga.

33:36.632 --> 33:40.600
Rosi, you know very
well I don't take commissions.

33:41.037 --> 33:43.137
I'll give you 35,000.

33:44.907 --> 33:46.156
I don't need the money.

33:46.291 --> 33:47.625
Are you quite certain?

33:47.760 --> 33:50.728
Your wife has just asked me
to design a gown for her.

33:52.665 --> 33:54.731
40,000, then

33:54.800 --> 33:57.234
I won't do it.

33:57.737 --> 34:01.505
50,000, but that
is as high as I will go?

34:06.796 --> 34:09.463
Sold for 50,000 francs!

34:13.936 --> 34:16.402
I'm afraid Monsieur
Picasso isn't at home.

34:16.472 --> 34:18.438
May I give him a message?

34:18.474 --> 34:25.029
Yes, yes, please, tell him, that
Max Jacob came to engage him

34:26.799 --> 34:29.933
in a bout of debauchery.

34:31.904 --> 34:33.904
Could you just give
him this, please?

34:35.841 --> 34:37.090
Monsieur Jacob.

34:37.092 --> 34:39.259
We have not seen you
in quite some time.

34:39.295 --> 34:45.099
The truth is that I am persona non
grata in the-the finer parts of Paris.

34:47.668 --> 34:50.737
Well, you are welcome here.

34:51.040 --> 34:55.626
Thank you, but I am afraid that,
I have a previous engagement.

35:04.837 --> 35:06.319
You opened my mail?

35:06.338 --> 35:08.205
Who is Fernande?

35:08.207 --> 35:09.790
Somebody I used to know.

35:09.859 --> 35:11.758
She writes as if
you had a life with her.

35:11.827 --> 35:13.827
It was long time ago, Olga.

35:13.863 --> 35:16.196
She's asking for money.
Do you give her money?

35:16.331 --> 35:18.799
- No.
- Our money? -No!

35:18.868 --> 35:20.267
How long were you together?

35:20.336 --> 35:22.936
Nine or ten years.

35:22.938 --> 35:26.189
And it never occurred
to you to mention her?

35:26.592 --> 35:28.336
Because I don't concern
myself with her anymore!

35:28.360 --> 35:30.194
Then why would
Max bring you this?

35:30.329 --> 35:33.263
He is a bleeding heart
trying to help an old friend.

35:33.299 --> 35:35.031
Well, you are a married man.

35:35.101 --> 35:36.767
With a reputation to protect.

35:36.836 --> 35:40.037
It's time to choose between your
"old friends" and your new wife.

35:45.327 --> 35:46.693
Pablo!

35:46.695 --> 35:48.795
Come in.

35:48.798 --> 35:50.997
For Fernande.

35:51.100 --> 35:53.867
I, thank you, I...

35:55.037 --> 35:58.872
This will help, for she is in a
chasm of despair, I'm afraid.

36:02.528 --> 36:05.395
Olga says you
came to our house, drunk.

36:07.399 --> 36:10.000
You say you found God,
became a Catholic,

36:10.969 --> 36:14.138
but you behave as if you
have no morals at all.

36:14.273 --> 36:17.190
Pablo. I, I am weak.

36:18.126 --> 36:21.728
I admit it, but at least I
have not abandoned my friends.

36:23.031 --> 36:25.766
I haven't abandoned anyone.

36:25.768 --> 36:29.903
When was the last
time you came to see me?

36:30.539 --> 36:34.257
Have you even once invited me
to your fancy new apartment?

36:34.326 --> 36:36.726
And when was the last time that
you talked to Apollinaire?

36:36.762 --> 36:38.862
Did you even know
that he was sick?

36:38.898 --> 36:40.831
No, no, I'll look in on him.

36:40.966 --> 36:42.566
Well, maybe you shouldn't.

36:42.701 --> 36:45.402
I wouldn't want you to scuff your
expensive shoes on the dirty

36:45.404 --> 36:47.404
cobblestones of Montmartre.

36:47.606 --> 36:51.525
I'm not going to
apologize for my success, Max.

36:51.660 --> 36:54.428
Or for the fact that I
don't live like this anymore.

36:54.897 --> 37:01.568
No, no, no, no, you spend your days with
the Marchesa and your snob of a wife,

37:03.305 --> 37:07.123
pretending that you
are an aristocrat.

37:08.327 --> 37:13.831
Olga has cleaned you up so
well, I hardly recognize you.

37:19.672 --> 37:22.506
You're 40 years
old, for God's sake.

37:23.325 --> 37:27.160
It's time to grow up.

37:27.296 --> 37:33.200
Until you do, maybe it's
best we don't see each other.

37:52.738 --> 37:55.205
Was anyone badly hurt?

37:55.274 --> 37:58.992
My wife has a broken wrist, the
children only a few bruises, thank God.

37:59.328 --> 38:00.527
They'll be all right.

38:00.596 --> 38:03.597
And the car
is totally destroyed?

38:03.599 --> 38:06.633
I'm sorry, Pablo,
I know how much you loved it.

38:06.902 --> 38:08.635
Let me get this right.

38:08.637 --> 38:12.639
You took your family out for a drive
in my car, without asking me?

38:14.126 --> 38:15.826
I thought you wouldn't mind.

38:15.961 --> 38:18.094
You said you didn't need
to go anywhere today.

38:18.130 --> 38:20.596
Right.

38:20.633 --> 38:25.836
Well, I, I suppose if I no longer have
a car, I no longer need a driver.

38:35.263 --> 38:37.798
You're firing me?

38:37.933 --> 38:39.899
I have trusted you, Marcel.

38:39.935 --> 38:42.502
You're the last person that
I thought would deceive me.

38:42.571 --> 38:44.271
How am I supposed to
rely on you now?

38:44.406 --> 38:45.739
Pablo, it was a mistake.

38:45.874 --> 38:47.068
I should have asked permission.

38:47.092 --> 38:48.758
I'm sorry, I, I'll
pay for the damages...

38:48.794 --> 38:51.328
Even if you could afford it,
you can't repair my trust.

38:51.397 --> 38:52.929
Can you?

38:52.998 --> 38:55.933
Pablo, I, I've
worked for you for 25 years.

38:56.068 --> 38:57.134
I think of you as family.

38:57.269 --> 38:59.469
I have too much family as it is.

38:59.538 --> 39:02.039
You should go and
tend to your own.

39:04.726 --> 39:08.327
You did trust me to drive you
from one mistress to the other.

39:08.364 --> 39:09.462
I kept all your secrets.

39:09.531 --> 39:11.898
I didn't have to do that.

39:12.167 --> 39:14.901
Are you threatening me, Marcel?

39:14.970 --> 39:19.306
You push everyone away, Pablo, and in
the end you're going to die alone.

39:28.066 --> 39:31.468
He survived the war, and now he
is going to be killed by the flu.

39:33.072 --> 39:36.239
Thank you for sending for me.

39:36.358 --> 39:39.426
I...

39:39.662 --> 39:42.295
I'll give you time alone, yeah?

39:55.327 --> 39:58.128
Pablo.

39:58.130 --> 40:01.131
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.

40:08.340 --> 40:11.791
Well, you're here now,

40:12.461 --> 40:15.195
and God hasn't managed to
shut me up just yet, so...

40:17.466 --> 40:20.200
Nobody could
shut you up, Guillaume.

40:22.037 --> 40:24.805
Look at you.

40:27.859 --> 40:30.460
I'm so proud of you.

40:32.631 --> 40:35.665
I wouldn't be
me, not without you.

40:38.336 --> 40:41.471
Tell me what
you're working on, now.

40:41.974 --> 40:45.292
Portraits, traditional ones.

40:46.728 --> 40:48.061
Can you believe that?

40:48.196 --> 40:51.131
Do you
remember our mission, Pablo?

40:51.300 --> 40:55.902
When we first drank absinthe
together, all those years ago?

41:05.697 --> 41:09.800
"The perpetual subversion
of the moral order."

41:11.403 --> 41:14.671
You must never
forget that, Pablo.

41:14.740 --> 41:19.226
No matter how many portraits you sell,
your art serves a greater purpose.

41:20.763 --> 41:22.796
You must never
become conventional.

41:22.798 --> 41:25.565
You must never surrender
to bourgeois existence.

41:28.837 --> 41:30.704
No matter how easy it is.

41:30.839 --> 41:35.625
You must always do
what is difficult.

41:44.903 --> 41:47.070
It was a beautiful service.

41:47.139 --> 41:49.372
Grandmother would have loved it.

41:54.463 --> 41:56.329
Could you
come back to the house?

41:56.464 --> 41:59.699
I have got a
long way back to Vallauris.

42:06.592 --> 42:09.425
Where is, Picasso?

42:09.461 --> 42:11.845
He's very busy
working on his retrospective.

42:11.930 --> 42:14.264
And that's more important than
your grandmother's funeral?

42:14.266 --> 42:18.135
Emile, please don't.

42:24.193 --> 42:28.995
I'm so sorry, Françoise.
For so much.

42:29.130 --> 42:34.734
Perhaps it wasn't right, but I treated
you as though you were a boy.

42:34.770 --> 42:37.971
I taught you to be
tough, to fight.

42:37.973 --> 42:40.056
And I'm grateful for that.

42:40.159 --> 42:44.461
Just, please tell
me that you're happy.

42:50.435 --> 42:54.638
I know I was harsh, but I raised
you to stand up to difficult men,

42:56.107 --> 42:59.192
not to put up with them.

42:59.394 --> 43:01.794
Stand up and
cheer, ladies and gentlemen.

43:01.830 --> 43:04.130
Diaghilev is reviving Parade!

43:05.533 --> 43:07.067
All of Paris will be talking.

43:07.069 --> 43:11.637
In Dieghilev, he has found the
most brilliant principal dancer.

43:12.507 --> 43:16.826
Well, I hope she isn't injured
or seduced into marriage before

43:16.862 --> 43:19.529
she has a chance to become
a truly great artist.

43:29.508 --> 43:32.425
I'm sure she'll be much
happier once the baby comes.

43:35.030 --> 43:40.100
He is perfect, his eyes.
His, his mouth.

43:44.006 --> 43:47.057
He is everything that I
have ever wanted, querida.

43:52.297 --> 43:57.500
If he is a soldier, he will be a
general, and if he's a priest,

44:00.806 --> 44:03.957
then he will be pope.

44:04.092 --> 44:06.793
Isn't that right, Paulo?

44:10.098 --> 44:13.366
You want me to be your driver?

44:13.435 --> 44:15.601
I bought a new Mercedes.

44:15.671 --> 44:17.671
Beautiful lines, a
powerful engine...

44:17.806 --> 44:19.638
I'm sure it's a
wonderful car, Papa, but...

44:19.675 --> 44:22.024
But-But-But what?

44:22.060 --> 44:25.128
You need a job,
I need a new driver.

44:25.130 --> 44:27.564
We can spend some
real time together.

44:28.433 --> 44:31.334
We can start by going to Arles for
the weekend, to the bullfights,

44:32.404 --> 44:35.371
like when your were little.

44:35.440 --> 44:36.922
Those were wonderful times.

44:36.925 --> 44:39.092
Yeah, so it's settled then!

44:39.094 --> 44:40.226
Heh?

44:40.262 --> 44:41.361
Okay.

44:41.430 --> 44:42.829
Genevieve!

44:42.831 --> 44:44.430
Let me introduce you
to my son, Paulo.

44:44.499 --> 44:46.432
You're gonna love her.

44:46.501 --> 44:49.436
She has even better lines than the
Mercedes, and she's coming with us.

44:50.472 --> 44:51.771
There she is.

44:51.906 --> 44:53.757
Genevieve, my son Paulo.

44:53.892 --> 44:56.359
Paulo, Genvieve.

45:03.001 --> 45:05.235
This just came for you, sir.

45:05.237 --> 45:07.370
Thank you.

45:23.538 --> 45:28.358
Dear Pablo, I was angry with you
after the harsh words we exchanged.

45:28.960 --> 45:33.729
But as they have come back to
me in my mind again and again,

45:34.265 --> 45:36.132
I realized you were right.

45:36.168 --> 45:40.169
It is time for me to grow up and
make good on my vow to God.

45:41.039 --> 45:44.990
I have decided to take up residence
in the monastery at Saint-Benoit,

45:45.027 --> 45:49.396
and I hope that I will finally find
peace and fulfilment in the embrace

45:49.931 --> 45:52.932
of the holy brothers.

45:53.802 --> 45:59.839
And as you bask in the embrace of
your new family, I hope, selfishly,

46:00.959 --> 46:06.929
that you will not become too comfortable,
that you will refuse, as you always have,

46:07.265 --> 46:12.135
to compromise your prodigious talent
and that you will never be satisfied

46:13.571 --> 46:19.125
with anything less than the
full expression of your genius.

46:23.198 --> 46:27.801
Yours faithfully, Max.

47:01.536 --> 47:04.003
Do you know who
these wild men are, son?

47:06.858 --> 47:09.559
They're your papa's brothers;

47:09.628 --> 47:14.097
The kind of friends that I hope
you find in your life someday.

47:18.036 --> 47:21.070
Pablo, what are you doing?

47:21.139 --> 47:24.691
You must not touch the baby
before you washed your hands!

47:57.325 --> 47:59.926
Françoise, Françoise!

48:01.229 --> 48:02.562
Hi.

48:02.697 --> 48:05.965
Paulo and I went to the
bullfights in Arles.

48:06.201 --> 48:08.067
Take this, take this, son.

48:10.171 --> 48:12.811
If I had known you were so close,
I would have come and joined you.

48:13.275 --> 48:17.360
I wanted to spend
some time alone with Paulo.

48:19.998 --> 48:21.830
What?

48:21.867 --> 48:25.401
You are the one who wanted me to
just give him more attention.

48:34.329 --> 48:36.896
What have you
been doing all this time?

48:36.898 --> 48:39.032
Working.

48:40.735 --> 48:43.703
Is there someone new?

48:43.905 --> 48:47.256
Who would want
an old man like me?

48:48.593 --> 48:52.495
Pablo, if anything, you've
always been honest with me.

48:56.100 --> 48:59.002
Now you're accusing me of lying?

49:00.872 --> 49:03.922
I should leave you.

49:03.959 --> 49:05.391
What are you talking about?

49:05.526 --> 49:06.826
You'd have your freedom.

49:06.961 --> 49:09.962
I could paint again.

49:10.465 --> 49:12.431
Don't be ridiculous.

49:12.467 --> 49:15.100
Nobody leaves Picasso!
