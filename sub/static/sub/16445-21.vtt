- <i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>
- You left me the virus.

00:05.094 --> 00:06.582
You've got two options.

00:06.653 --> 00:09.055
<i>You can take the virus
and find the strength</i>

00:09.123 --> 00:10.818
and get out of there. Or...

00:11.013 --> 00:13.849
<i>you can make that coffin
your permanent home.</i>

- Good-bye, Fish!

00:28.175 --> 00:29.909

(blows)

00:42.070 --> 00:43.371
(gasps)

00:43.561 --> 00:44.631
Impossible.

00:44.905 --> 00:46.733
(clicks tongue) Nothing...

00:47.127 --> 00:48.624
is impossible.

00:52.599 --> 00:54.300
Things are looking up.

00:54.614 --> 00:57.864
My little Penguin and I will be leaving.

00:59.067 --> 01:02.742
TEMPLE SHAMAN: <i>This detonator
will trigger the bomb.</i>

01:02.809 --> 01:05.507
Thousands will be
infected with the virus.

01:05.585 --> 01:08.788
Let Gotham fall so you may rise.

01:08.867 --> 01:10.757
GORDON: I won't have him
turn you into a murderer.

01:10.781 --> 01:13.028
No. You will press it!

01:15.422 --> 01:17.122
When you're ready, come and find me.

My money, my savings.

01:38.679 --> 01:40.762

01:40.848 --> 01:44.195
My-my money, my savings.
I want my money, my savings.

01:44.236 --> 01:46.993

Fine.

03:35.826 --> 03:37.882
(gulps) I'm fine, Harvey.

03:38.228 --> 03:40.264
Listen, I hate to do this to you, pal.

03:40.491 --> 03:42.402
But I'm gonna have to ask for your gun.

03:42.871 --> 03:44.866
This virus is tearing the city apart.

03:44.902 --> 03:47.090
You need me. I can control this.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.304
That's why I'm not
asking for your badge.

03:49.559 --> 03:51.699
Some of the guys are talking.

03:51.875 --> 03:54.709
These cops are gonna be watching you
for the smallest sign.

03:54.957 --> 03:57.056
Okay? And if you've got a gun,

03:57.081 --> 03:58.313
they'll be double jumpy.

03:58.348 --> 04:00.199
It's for your own protection.

04:07.391 --> 04:08.723
Any word on Lee?

04:09.174 --> 04:11.493
Nada. What happened after the bombing?

04:11.528 --> 04:14.115
A mob of infected
swarmed the clock tower.

04:14.162 --> 04:16.076
- She disappeared in the chaos.
- I don't get it.

04:16.100 --> 04:17.377
She went through all that effort

04:17.401 --> 04:19.868
to get you infected with
the virus and she just bolts?

04:19.903 --> 04:21.503
She saw I was fighting it.

04:21.538 --> 04:22.771
(holsters gun)

04:22.806 --> 04:24.980
She's waiting for me to give over to it.

04:26.417 --> 04:28.743
Prove her wrong.

04:32.464 --> 04:34.300

Detective Gordon.

04:51.001 --> 04:52.314
Alfred.

04:52.837 --> 04:54.402
Has he said anything?

04:54.564 --> 04:57.092
No, no, he just sits there staring.

04:57.975 --> 05:00.041
I need to talk to him, Harvey.

05:00.185 --> 05:01.643
We sure that's not the clone?

05:01.787 --> 05:03.185
No, that's Bruce.

05:03.279 --> 05:05.046
God knows what those
bastards done to him,

05:05.076 --> 05:06.560
but he's only brainwashed.

05:06.783 --> 05:08.850
Are you really the best
person to talk to him?

05:08.934 --> 05:11.064
I mean, from what you said, you
killed his mentor or something.

05:11.088 --> 05:12.320
He might be a bit peeved.

05:12.395 --> 05:16.910
Listen, whatever they did to him,
that is Bruce Wayne in there.

05:17.004 --> 05:19.227
That boy is stronger than
you can possibly imagine.

05:20.148 --> 05:22.281
I just need to make him remember...

05:23.335 --> 05:24.726
who he is.

05:25.269 --> 05:27.035
As long as he doesn't
leave the precinct.

05:27.070 --> 05:28.001
(footfalls approaching)

05:28.026 --> 05:29.704
Harvey, something you need to see.

05:31.675 --> 05:33.575
(fire truck horn blares outside)

05:38.500 --> 05:41.249
BULLOCK: An antidote?
Lucius, I could kiss your face.

05:41.285 --> 05:43.363
Before you do that, I don't
actually have the formula.

05:43.387 --> 05:45.240
But there is an antidote?
That's what you're saying?

05:45.264 --> 05:46.185
I was going through the papers

05:46.210 --> 05:47.700
you recovered from
the Owl leader's house.

05:47.724 --> 05:49.335
They suggest that while
Strange was working

05:49.359 --> 05:50.792
to weaponize the Tetch virus,

05:50.827 --> 05:52.870
he was also working
on a parallel project,

05:52.895 --> 05:55.692
tailoring different antiviral
agents to his own ends.

05:55.799 --> 05:57.732
Strange was designing an antidote.

05:57.768 --> 05:59.201
That makes sense.

05:59.520 --> 06:00.836
The Court was careful
to protect its own.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.346
They would want a safeguard.

06:03.039 --> 06:04.773
We need to talk to Strange.

06:04.992 --> 06:06.962
Is he still here or has he been moved?

06:07.044 --> 06:09.642
Uh, well, when you were
buried in the coffin

06:09.720 --> 06:11.446
and the city was
about to be virus-bombed,

06:11.485 --> 06:12.735
some decisions had to be made.

06:12.816 --> 06:14.165
Harvey...

06:14.993 --> 06:16.921
I told Alfred to question Strange.

06:17.026 --> 06:18.564
In exchange for him telling us

06:18.589 --> 06:21.289
where the bombing was
gonna go down, Alfred

06:21.337 --> 06:24.423
let Strange walk. Yes,
I'm blaming it on the butler.

06:26.697 --> 06:29.397
All right. Strange is a weasel.

06:29.689 --> 06:32.517
He'd try to get as far away
from this as possible.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.302
Union Station is shut down.

06:34.338 --> 06:36.404
Downtown train station's our best bet.

06:36.440 --> 06:38.006
- Okay. Wait up.
- (handcuffs rattle)

06:38.360 --> 06:39.518
Harvey?

06:39.599 --> 06:42.006
Lucius, I know what
you're gonna say, all right?

06:42.099 --> 06:43.144
He can handle this.

06:43.172 --> 06:45.872
Hell, Barnes had the virus
for weeks before anyone knew.

06:46.155 --> 06:48.883
What I was going to say:
from all I see here,

06:48.919 --> 06:52.128
Strange's virus is an accelerated
version of the Tetch virus.

06:52.253 --> 06:54.315
Why do you think people
are reacting so quickly?

06:54.667 --> 06:56.979
Gordon isn't going to be able
to fight this for long.

06:57.060 --> 06:59.375
Well, we'll just have to
wait and see, huh?

06:59.515 --> 07:01.533
You keep working on that antidote.

07:04.536 --> 07:07.124
CLERK: One second, one second,
one ticket at a time.

07:09.206 --> 07:12.507

07:12.542 --> 07:15.477

07:15.512 --> 07:16.878
MAN: Sir, excuse me!

07:23.341 --> 07:24.826
Ooh.

07:24.904 --> 07:26.254
Excuse me.

07:27.291 --> 07:29.324
Oh, no.

07:30.594 --> 07:32.894
I think you mean, "Hello, Fish.

07:33.317 --> 07:35.043
I miss you."

07:35.299 --> 07:37.309
And don't worry, sweetheart.

07:37.501 --> 07:39.834

08:05.919 --> 08:07.919
(fire truck horn blaring)

08:07.955 --> 08:10.565
I will say this about the Court of Owls:

08:11.065 --> 08:14.559
they have style.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.713
(both chuckle)

08:15.760 --> 08:18.997
Not to mention they've handed us
the perfect opportunity.

08:19.033 --> 08:20.458
For what?

08:20.591 --> 08:22.700
The city is in total disarray.

08:22.997 --> 08:25.570
What better time to consolidate power?

08:26.223 --> 08:27.700
Barbara,

08:28.419 --> 08:30.208
I've told you again and again,

08:30.244 --> 08:33.441
I have no interest in running Gotham.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.760
- I only want...
- To kill Penguin. Yes.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.650
I got it the first billion times.

08:38.686 --> 08:39.985
And where is he now? Oh!

08:40.018 --> 08:42.486
That's right, with Fish Mooney.

08:42.523 --> 08:43.789
So we find her.

08:43.823 --> 08:46.291
And then what? You blast through

08:46.326 --> 08:48.627
her army of goons
until you get to Oswald?

08:48.742 --> 08:50.757
You're gonna need muscle, honey.

08:50.827 --> 08:52.194
Which you provide.

08:52.280 --> 08:55.210
Oh, so you expect my help?

08:55.444 --> 08:57.678
But when I need yours,

08:57.928 --> 09:02.596
to take advantage of an
opportunity of a lifetime...

09:03.104 --> 09:04.768
...nothing.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.545
(explosion outside)

09:08.546 --> 09:10.249
Baby.

09:11.382 --> 09:13.618
Listen, all I ask

09:13.827 --> 09:17.521
is that you use this beautiful

09:17.646 --> 09:19.677
big brain of yours

09:19.872 --> 09:22.349
to help me, finally,

09:23.119 --> 09:26.314
get this city under my thumb.

09:26.823 --> 09:28.467
And afterwards,

09:28.502 --> 09:32.471
I will help you
pry Penguin away from Fish.

09:32.506 --> 09:33.772
(sirens wailing outside)

09:34.073 --> 09:35.330
Deal?

09:36.971 --> 09:40.127
I will give you a day.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.616

MOONEY: I thought we were friends.

09:47.251 --> 09:51.356
When the Court of Owls calls,
o-one does not refuse.

09:51.426 --> 09:53.840
Still, I'm not upset.

09:54.215 --> 09:57.462
I knew when your old
masters summoned you,

09:57.614 --> 10:01.379
it was to cook up some horror,
and here's the thing:

10:01.502 --> 10:03.235
I need horror.

10:03.613 --> 10:05.537
They're responsible
for all of this, aren't they?

10:05.785 --> 10:08.858
At the behest of the Court,
I weaponized a virus

10:08.928 --> 10:11.170
that releases a person's darkest urges.

10:11.641 --> 10:14.162
Thousands have been infected.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.882
So where is this virus?

10:17.522 --> 10:19.718
I know there's more.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.529
It has all been used. Please, I must go.

10:22.590 --> 10:26.559
Don't. You will give me the virus,

10:26.668 --> 10:31.163
you will make me the army you promised,

10:31.275 --> 10:35.392
you will do everything I say

10:35.525 --> 10:40.005
until this city
is in the palm of my hand.

10:40.771 --> 10:42.388

11:25.285 --> 11:27.145
<i>Crazy day, huh?</i>

11:27.321 --> 11:28.620
Lee, where are you?

11:28.655 --> 11:30.543
<i>Somewhere very familiar to you.</i>

11:30.941 --> 11:32.784
I know how you're feeling.

11:33.316 --> 11:35.937
All that blood rushing
through your veins,

11:35.999 --> 11:37.062
your heart beating

11:37.097 --> 11:39.118
<i>faster and faster.</i>

11:39.333 --> 11:41.299
(ears ringing, heart beating)

11:41.460 --> 11:42.801
Listen to me,

11:43.000 --> 11:44.965
<i>you need to turn yourself in;
it's not safe.</i>

11:44.990 --> 11:47.090
<i>The infected are being killed
all over the city.</i>

11:47.115 --> 11:49.396
- Wow, you're really fighting this, huh?
- (heart beating)

11:49.602 --> 11:51.065
<i>You know, you don't have to.</i>

11:51.573 --> 11:54.425
- <i>The cage is finally open, Jim.</i>
- (ears ringing)

11:54.503 --> 11:55.823
<i>You're free.</i>

11:55.909 --> 11:57.916
- No.
- <i>I thought you loved me.</i>

11:58.830 --> 12:00.652
I thought you wanted us to be together.

12:00.713 --> 12:02.352
Not like this.

12:02.969 --> 12:04.281
<i>Well...</i>

12:04.458 --> 12:05.490
(cork squeaks)

12:05.525 --> 12:07.328
...this is the only way, Jim.

12:07.461 --> 12:09.345
<i>Just listen to the whispers.</i>

12:09.529 --> 12:11.296
(ears ringing, heart beating)

12:11.331 --> 12:12.797
GORDON (whispers): <i>Killer.</i>

12:13.834 --> 12:16.004
They'll lead you to me,

12:16.543 --> 12:18.121
tell you who you are.

12:18.235 --> 12:19.735
GORDON (whispers): <i>Killer.</i>

12:19.873 --> 12:21.106
That's not who I am.

12:21.314 --> 12:23.236
<i>I wonder what they're saying.</i>

12:23.619 --> 12:26.939
<i>That you like hurting people,
killing people?</i>

12:27.047 --> 12:28.108
GORDON (whispers): <i>Killer.</i>

12:28.529 --> 12:30.498
See how well I know you, Jim.

12:31.279 --> 12:33.295
<i>Now I'm gonna go have some fun.</i>

12:33.521 --> 12:35.053
<i>We'll catch up soon.</i>

12:35.654 --> 12:37.054
Promise.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.526
(phone beeps)

12:41.660 --> 12:44.751
GORDON (whispers): <i>Killer... killer...</i>

12:44.955 --> 12:46.791
<i>you're a killer.</i>

12:46.967 --> 12:48.400
(phone flips)

12:48.496 --> 12:50.801
BULLOCK: Jim! Jim.

12:51.034 --> 12:52.370
Someone spotted Strange.

12:54.214 --> 12:56.753
Just don't shoot any
innocent bystanders.

12:56.854 --> 12:59.010
Or me. Especially me.

13:00.347 --> 13:04.215
(electrical crackling)

13:05.114 --> 13:08.090
- GORDON: GCPD!
- Don't move!

13:08.502 --> 13:10.202
Fish?

13:10.859 --> 13:12.351
What a surprise.

13:12.508 --> 13:15.226
MOONEY: My goodness,
Harvey, you look awful.

13:15.429 --> 13:16.895
It's good to see you, too.

13:17.027 --> 13:19.397
We just want Strange. You can walk away.

13:19.441 --> 13:21.894
Yeah. Uh, no.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.736
Fish, I know in your own
sick way, you love this city,

13:24.771 --> 13:26.638
and Gotham is bleeding to death.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.807
We need this dirtbag to fix it.

13:28.842 --> 13:31.008
Enough talking. Hand him over.

13:31.139 --> 13:32.892
- (skin crackling)
- STRANGE: He has it.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.454
It's in his eyes.

13:35.525 --> 13:38.356
He has the virus. (chuckles)

13:38.552 --> 13:40.085
Really?

13:42.155 --> 13:43.888
So tell me, James,

13:44.176 --> 13:46.223
what's it feel like?

13:46.840 --> 13:49.791
Like it's taking all my willpower...

13:50.163 --> 13:51.329
not to kill you.

13:52.142 --> 13:53.470
Ooh, my.

13:53.533 --> 13:57.147
Harvey, when you say Hugo
here can save the city,

13:57.209 --> 13:58.382
does that mean there's a...

13:58.905 --> 14:00.772
cure for this virus?

14:00.874 --> 14:03.108
Fish, I swear to God,
if you don't step back,

14:03.194 --> 14:05.844
I will shoot you and
these two nimrods right here,

14:05.879 --> 14:06.845
- right now!
- (gun cocks)

14:06.880 --> 14:09.014
Hugo, is it true

14:09.290 --> 14:12.774
that you're the only one
that can stop this madness?

14:13.487 --> 14:14.586
Mm-hmm.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.621
(Strange and Mooney laugh)

14:16.656 --> 14:18.979
Obviously, I can't give him up now.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.032
Fine, you had your chance.

14:21.103 --> 14:23.895
- (gasps) Oh.
- (whooshing)

14:23.930 --> 14:29.067
(Mooney laughing)

14:29.102 --> 14:32.404
Did you really think that I
would come without backup?

14:33.508 --> 14:35.950
- GORDON (whispers): <i>You're a killer.</i>
- BULLOCK: Jim,

14:36.209 --> 14:38.476
- dial it down, buddy.
- MOONEY: Victor,

14:38.646 --> 14:41.813
looks like our little
Detective Gordon is overheating.

14:41.967 --> 14:43.681
Perhaps you should cool him off.

14:43.717 --> 14:44.949
Both of them.

14:46.853 --> 14:48.186
(gun powering up)

14:56.963 --> 14:58.730
(ice crackling)

14:58.765 --> 14:59.898
Marvelous.

15:00.460 --> 15:02.834
Just marvelous.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.006
There he is,

15:08.452 --> 15:10.739
- the real James Gordon.
- (growling)

15:12.239 --> 15:15.262
Nice to meet you, at last.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.682
(laughs)

15:19.352 --> 15:21.052
(laughing continues)

15:24.458 --> 15:27.358
(sirens wailing)

15:28.595 --> 15:32.168
ALFRED: There we go, Master Bruce.
Two lumps, just how you like it.

15:32.738 --> 15:34.684
You hungry, mate?

15:35.340 --> 15:37.683
Can I whip you up a sandwich?

15:39.539 --> 15:42.040
Anyway, if all goes well,
we should be able to

15:42.075 --> 15:44.152
head back to Wayne Manor tomorrow.

15:44.909 --> 15:48.139
Although, I was thinking
that we could go abroad.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.008
We could go to Switzerland.

15:50.688 --> 15:52.930
I mean, we used to go with your
mum and dad this time of year.

15:52.954 --> 15:54.422
Stop it.

15:55.476 --> 15:57.824
Your attempts to elicit
an emotional response

15:57.872 --> 16:01.106
by reminding me of shared memories
is clumsy and pathetic.

16:04.162 --> 16:05.887
The last memory I have is of

16:05.912 --> 16:08.481
you killing the best friend
and teacher I ever had.

16:09.951 --> 16:11.873
You mean that old geezer that...

16:12.170 --> 16:13.852
kidnapped you, poisoned your mind,

16:13.945 --> 16:16.180
then tried to turn you
into a mass murderer.

16:16.922 --> 16:18.906
Let me tell you something, Master Bruce:

16:18.938 --> 16:23.332
that man lied to you.

16:23.659 --> 16:25.915
Him and his bloody Court of Owls,

16:25.986 --> 16:28.728
they tried to use you,
they tried to manipulate you.

16:28.782 --> 16:30.080
You say he was a liar.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.458
How?

16:34.400 --> 16:36.757
By taking away the pain
I've carried for years?

16:36.782 --> 16:38.227
By giving me revenge against the people

16:38.251 --> 16:39.664
who killed my mother and father?

16:42.712 --> 16:44.344
That's more than you ever did.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.437
(scoffs)

16:49.376 --> 16:51.943
Anyway, the Court of Owls
does not matter.

16:52.858 --> 16:56.281
They merely paved the way
for the one who is to come.

16:57.121 --> 16:58.783
What do you mean?

17:00.554 --> 17:02.574
Who-who's coming?

17:06.144 --> 17:07.705
You'll see.

17:13.290 --> 17:15.867
- I should cook him.
- They want him alive.

17:15.892 --> 17:17.321
So I'll just cook part of him.

17:17.407 --> 17:19.400
(chuckles): Oh, no, my dear.

17:19.617 --> 17:22.642
- Let's be calm.
- You don't have that kind of control.

17:22.710 --> 17:23.946
And you do?

17:24.095 --> 17:26.854
In my hands,
this flamethrower is a scalpel.

17:26.912 --> 17:27.912
Fine.

17:27.948 --> 17:29.612
We each take a foot.

17:30.128 --> 17:32.334
Whoever goes above the ankle loses.

17:32.412 --> 17:33.616
- You're on.
- (guns powering up)

17:33.640 --> 17:35.779
No. N-No. Stop!

17:35.842 --> 17:37.869
Ms. Mooney! Ms. Mooney!

17:37.939 --> 17:39.533
OSWALD: Mooney's busy.

17:40.908 --> 17:43.096
I'm here now. (chuckles)

17:45.424 --> 17:46.924
Mmm.

17:47.136 --> 17:49.687
Also, I think your children
are angry with you.

17:49.792 --> 17:52.644
- Mr. Cobblepot.
- It's understandable.

17:53.259 --> 17:56.769
You made them what they are,

17:57.358 --> 17:58.930
then abandoned them.

17:59.030 --> 18:01.947
You are working with Ms. Mooney?

18:02.273 --> 18:03.827
We're partners. (chuckles)

18:04.038 --> 18:06.111
But you tried to kill her.

18:07.199 --> 18:08.780
And she forgave me.

18:09.246 --> 18:11.238
I know. Surprised me, too.

18:11.371 --> 18:14.051
But, Mooney is not the old Mooney.

18:14.184 --> 18:16.104
She has evolved.

18:16.174 --> 18:18.323
And she has a vision for Gotham.

18:19.088 --> 18:22.527
She sees a city where
people like myself,

18:23.058 --> 18:26.871
Victor, Bridgit... freaks...

18:27.520 --> 18:29.090
are in charge.

18:31.038 --> 18:33.349
And you are gonna help us achieve that.

18:34.302 --> 18:37.497
- I can't.
- Wrong, Professor!

18:38.198 --> 18:41.974
This virus is tearing Gotham apart.

18:42.169 --> 18:46.156
That makes your antidote the
most valuable thing in the city.

18:46.557 --> 18:49.437
We could demand half of Gotham

18:49.609 --> 18:52.382
and the city council
deliver it to us on a platter.

18:52.531 --> 18:56.061
So, I'm going to ask you once,

18:56.757 --> 18:58.063
where is it?

18:58.819 --> 19:02.304
If I tell you where the antidote is,

19:03.062 --> 19:04.669
I have nothing.

19:06.052 --> 19:07.539
I can't.

19:07.574 --> 19:10.175
(chuckles)

19:10.210 --> 19:12.677
You can torture me all you want.

19:13.192 --> 19:15.447
(sighs)

19:15.856 --> 19:17.115
Okay.

19:17.150 --> 19:18.942
- (chuckles)
- What?

19:19.005 --> 19:22.764
You know, when I was in Arkham,
I was tortured daily.

19:22.789 --> 19:25.820
Oh. Well, that was therapy, Oswald.

19:26.195 --> 19:27.625
Therapy.

19:29.551 --> 19:31.618
And that device you used

19:31.661 --> 19:33.861
to administer the therapy,

19:34.199 --> 19:35.402
remember that?

19:36.316 --> 19:38.132
It gave the sensation

19:38.434 --> 19:40.768
that your head was being torn open

19:40.840 --> 19:44.739
so that hot lava could be poured
directly into your brain.

19:45.083 --> 19:46.507
Afterwards,

19:47.044 --> 19:50.161
just thinking of it
would make me physically ill.

19:54.248 --> 19:56.920
So, naturally, I had to have it.

19:57.014 --> 19:59.787
(laughs)

19:59.831 --> 20:01.831
(laughs)

20:01.858 --> 20:04.258
- Oh!
- One moment, Oswald.

20:04.353 --> 20:06.272
STRANGE: No! All right, all right!

20:06.297 --> 20:08.196
I'll-I'll tell you anything
you need to know.

20:08.320 --> 20:11.047
- I'll tell you where the antidote is.
- I know.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.716
But not just yet, 'kay?

20:14.800 --> 20:15.832
What?

20:16.020 --> 20:17.071
(device powering up)

20:17.107 --> 20:19.040
(screaming)

20:19.075 --> 20:22.043
(fires crackling)

20:22.078 --> 20:25.279
(busy tone beeping)

20:25.315 --> 20:26.547
(phone flips, beeps)

20:26.820 --> 20:29.445
They're not answering at the precinct.
They must be overwhelmed.

20:29.578 --> 20:31.782
Well, we're not shooting our way out.

20:32.112 --> 20:33.578
GORDON (whispers): <i>Killer.</i>

20:33.857 --> 20:34.922
(ears ringing)

20:34.958 --> 20:35.958
(yells)

20:35.992 --> 20:36.992
(ice cracking)

20:37.237 --> 20:38.436
Jim, take it easy.

20:38.461 --> 20:39.618
- Someone will come!
- (yells)

20:39.642 --> 20:41.725
Yeah, and by then,
Mooney will have gotten Strange

20:41.750 --> 20:43.015
to give her the antidote!

20:43.085 --> 20:44.390
We're running out of time!

20:46.469 --> 20:48.536
- (heart beating rapidly)
- (ice cracking)

20:48.794 --> 20:50.415
GORDON'S VOICE (whispers): <i>Killer.</i>

20:50.665 --> 20:53.603
<i>Killer. Killer.</i>

20:54.010 --> 20:55.610
- (heart pounding)
- <i>Killer!</i>

21:06.356 --> 21:08.356
(panting)

21:08.391 --> 21:09.624
(snarls)

21:10.315 --> 21:12.682
I knew you could do it.

21:12.996 --> 21:14.562
(sirens wailing)

21:14.597 --> 21:16.130
(Gordon growls)

21:16.677 --> 21:18.927
Come on, Jim! Fight it!

21:19.615 --> 21:21.365
- Fight the damn virus!
- (growls)

21:21.552 --> 21:23.395
Not my car. That's my car!

21:23.611 --> 21:25.573
(snarling)

21:25.608 --> 21:26.608
(car horn blaring)

21:26.653 --> 21:28.143
- Let me drive.
- (car crashes)

21:28.821 --> 21:30.654
Alvarez, spread the word,

21:30.705 --> 21:32.909
Mayor James has called in
the National Guard.

21:33.197 --> 21:35.604
We don't want any soldiers
getting shot by mistake.

21:35.706 --> 21:36.784
Leave me alone.

21:37.198 --> 21:39.102
The hell's wrong with you?

21:40.023 --> 21:42.188
Alvarez, I'm talking to you.

21:42.477 --> 21:45.617
I said leave me alone!

21:45.836 --> 21:46.994
(gags)

21:47.030 --> 21:48.596
(neck snaps)

21:50.036 --> 21:52.349
ALFRED: So, I will ask you again.

21:52.599 --> 21:54.146
Who's coming?

21:54.536 --> 21:56.396
I mean, I thought
the man that I dispatched

21:56.421 --> 21:59.001
at Wayne Enterprises was the
leader of the Court of Owls.

21:59.079 --> 22:00.308
I want you to leave.

22:00.438 --> 22:02.358
Yeah, well, that ain't
gonna happen, is it, mate?

22:02.501 --> 22:04.758
You can't get rid of me that easy.

22:05.172 --> 22:07.258
You have to remember

22:07.821 --> 22:09.107
who you are.

22:09.287 --> 22:13.092
I know who I am. I have a destiny.

22:13.287 --> 22:15.099
Now, you listen to me.

22:15.842 --> 22:19.979
That man that wanted you
to detonate that bomb...

22:20.503 --> 22:22.370
whatever he promised you...

22:22.472 --> 22:25.300
freedom from pain, power... none of it,

22:25.604 --> 22:26.956
none of it was real.

22:27.026 --> 22:29.670
I want you to remember what is real.

22:29.698 --> 22:31.181
I know what's real!

22:31.317 --> 22:33.541
I got vengeance for my parents' murder.

22:33.565 --> 22:35.283
That's real!

22:36.666 --> 22:38.416
No.

22:39.549 --> 22:41.482
No, that's not real.

22:44.153 --> 22:45.750
What's real

22:46.422 --> 22:49.868
is every time that you were sick
when you were a kid...

22:50.660 --> 22:53.251
your mum used to sit up
with you all night

22:53.363 --> 22:55.663
and read to you till you
fell asleep. That's real.

22:56.672 --> 22:59.781
Or when you were seven and you
took your silly rowing boat out

22:59.827 --> 23:01.796
and you got lost in that storm,

23:01.838 --> 23:04.218
and me and your dad were out,
shouting and screaming,

23:04.265 --> 23:05.906
losing our minds.

23:05.942 --> 23:09.873
And when your dad found you,
how he cried.

23:12.014 --> 23:13.547
That's real.

23:14.639 --> 23:15.816
Yes...

23:16.240 --> 23:19.693
your parents died in that alley
three years ago

23:19.718 --> 23:22.538
and maybe that man took away
the pain of that night.

23:23.195 --> 23:27.203
But there is no life,
there is no love without pain.

23:28.973 --> 23:32.110
He could not touch the love
that your mom and dad gave you,

23:32.135 --> 23:35.852
that you still have it in you,
that you still have in here.

23:38.608 --> 23:41.491
The same love that I have for you.

23:45.882 --> 23:48.365
I love you, Master Bruce.

23:49.878 --> 23:51.451
I would do anything for you.

23:51.554 --> 23:53.123
I would die for you.

23:54.756 --> 23:56.225
You must...

23:56.592 --> 23:58.436
find that love again.

24:02.592 --> 24:05.162
(sighs) Come back to me, Master Bruce.

24:08.604 --> 24:10.371

24:56.119 --> 24:57.119
Thank you very much.

24:57.658 --> 24:59.150
No problem.

24:59.368 --> 25:00.500
Excuse me.

25:06.818 --> 25:08.595
Oh, bloody hell.

25:16.158 --> 25:17.338
GILZEAN: What I'm saying is

25:17.416 --> 25:19.291
if Penguin and Fish have hooked up,

25:19.330 --> 25:22.031
things are gonna get
real bad, real fast.

25:22.176 --> 25:24.106
- You want to run?
- No.

25:24.245 --> 25:26.825
I'm saying maybe she takes care
of Barbara and Nygma for us.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.365
I mean, we can even help things along.

25:28.389 --> 25:30.301
Send word to Fish
about where Babs is weak.

25:32.278 --> 25:33.684

25:56.166 --> 25:57.799
Well, this is a strange day.

26:00.184 --> 26:01.817
Never thought I'd see you in here.

26:02.504 --> 26:05.133
Had some time to kill
while my ex sees the light.

26:05.158 --> 26:06.954
Figured I'd have a little fun.

26:07.725 --> 26:09.224
Where's Babs?

26:09.744 --> 26:12.528
- What do you want with her?
- None of your business, errand boy.

26:14.377 --> 26:16.365
- I'm sorry, what did you call me?
- (laughs)

26:16.400 --> 26:18.608
I'm sorry, you're not an errand boy.

26:19.124 --> 26:21.003
You're more of a shoeshine boy.

26:21.139 --> 26:23.779
They should give you a little stand
in the front, cute little hat.

26:23.865 --> 26:26.943
- That's more your speed.
- Right. Out.

26:27.077 --> 26:28.744
(skin crackling)

26:28.982 --> 26:30.712
- Oh.
- Yeah.

26:38.698 --> 26:39.844
Oh...

26:42.960 --> 26:44.193
You've got the virus.

26:44.344 --> 26:45.894
Wow, you're not as dumb as I've heard.

26:46.094 --> 26:48.654
Are there any other glaringly
obvious remarks you'd like to make?

26:48.750 --> 26:51.366
How about I cut your lungs out
and show them to you?

26:51.475 --> 26:52.968
Wow, that's incredibly vivid.

26:53.147 --> 26:54.866
I'd like to see you try it.

26:55.473 --> 26:58.085
But I'm here for your boss,
the crazy blonde.

26:58.288 --> 27:00.108
- She's not my boss.
- Uh-huh.

27:00.257 --> 27:03.460
I may have a virus making me
freakishly strong and mildly insane,

27:03.936 --> 27:06.381
but even I know that you were
a sidekick to your brother

27:06.417 --> 27:07.819
and you're a sidekick to Barbara.

27:07.985 --> 27:12.068
So, can you send her a message for me?

27:12.093 --> 27:13.293
- Would you?
- (Gilzean groans)

27:13.827 --> 27:15.791
- Your boss...
- (Gilzean groans)

27:16.398 --> 27:18.093
...tell her next time I see her,

27:18.156 --> 27:19.862
I'm gonna rip her head
right off her body.

27:19.897 --> 27:21.396
(explosion outside)

27:21.432 --> 27:22.764

27:22.800 --> 27:24.132

27:28.072 --> 27:30.005

27:30.040 --> 27:32.074
(explosion outside)

27:32.665 --> 27:34.884
- God...
- What, you need help?

27:40.918 --> 27:41.918

27:55.690 --> 27:57.876

- OFFICER 2: Got him.

27:58.191 --> 27:59.519
<i>Shut down.</i>

27:59.628 --> 28:03.108
OFFICER: <i>All individuals
must remain indoors.</i>

28:03.374 --> 28:07.475
<i>Any activity outdoors
will be considered criminal activity.</i>

28:10.047 --> 28:11.847
- (helicopter whirring)
- OFFICER: Clear here.

28:12.060 --> 28:14.013
OFFICER 2: Let's go,
let's go. Clear out.

28:14.088 --> 28:15.620
OFFICER: <i>Remain indoors.</i>

28:16.220 --> 28:17.819
(siren wailing)

28:17.855 --> 28:19.943
He's following directions or something.

28:20.005 --> 28:21.849
I've got to find out
who's controlling him,

28:22.318 --> 28:23.818
who's brainwashed him.

28:24.287 --> 28:25.543
And then what?

28:25.670 --> 28:27.129
(explosions)

28:27.164 --> 28:29.498
I'm gonna kill the bastard.

28:33.862 --> 28:35.714
You two wait here.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.239
Professor, if this is a trap,

28:37.274 --> 28:38.740
you will soon find yourself hanging

28:38.776 --> 28:40.676
- with the rest of the meat.
- It's no trap.

28:41.003 --> 28:44.719
I tested earlier versions of the virus
and the antidote on livestock.

28:44.834 --> 28:47.268
I made sure to set aside
a successful batch.

28:47.664 --> 28:50.399
This place gives me the creeps.

28:50.536 --> 28:52.078
I like it.

29:07.905 --> 29:09.438
It's concentrated.

29:10.006 --> 29:11.850
Once you dilute it,

29:12.209 --> 29:17.479
there is enough here to cure
every infected person in Gotham.

29:18.533 --> 29:19.986
Hmm.

29:23.850 --> 29:25.383
Oswald,

29:25.984 --> 29:29.859
you and I will rule this city together.

29:29.937 --> 29:31.099
OSWALD: Yes.

29:31.124 --> 29:32.996
But first, I have to kill Ed Nygma.

29:33.183 --> 29:34.463
He has to die.

29:34.628 --> 29:36.472
MOONEY: Oh, he will.

29:37.597 --> 29:41.043
And all those who try
to stand in our way.

29:46.987 --> 29:48.653
What's this?

29:53.780 --> 29:55.468
Who's there?

29:56.006 --> 29:57.795
Show yourself.

30:07.998 --> 30:09.279
Who are they?

30:09.505 --> 30:11.099
Don't look at me, I don't know.

30:12.670 --> 30:15.699
MOONEY: Really? That's all you've got?

30:18.769 --> 30:22.110
Hand over the antidote now.

30:24.581 --> 30:26.481
(guns powering up)

30:31.321 --> 30:32.621
(grunting)

30:37.702 --> 30:41.142

all available units there now.

It's okay. It's-it's o...
We can, we can get you some help.

32:07.366 --> 32:08.806
MOONEY: No, no, no.

32:09.107 --> 32:13.064
I've done this enough times
to know I'm finished.

32:13.105 --> 32:14.940
- (Mooney groans)
- No. D-Do not say that.

32:14.965 --> 32:17.059
- We-we will get you help.
- Listen to me.

32:17.250 --> 32:20.993
(groans)

32:21.220 --> 32:22.969
Listen to me.

32:24.196 --> 32:26.857
Make this city yours...

32:29.288 --> 32:33.100
...or you burn it to the ground.

All of them!

33:25.866 --> 33:27.498
Strange...

33:28.035 --> 33:31.287
You better tell me that you
can make more of that antidote.

33:32.100 --> 33:34.214
Yes, yes.

33:34.427 --> 33:37.409
I just need one thing.

BARBARA: You sure about this?

34:09.860 --> 34:12.710
According to my sources,
Fish Mooney and the GCPD

34:12.735 --> 34:15.408
are scrambling to recover
the antidote to this virus.

34:15.534 --> 34:18.534
But Fish is dead.

34:18.804 --> 34:21.473
And Hugo Strange,
who designed the antidote,

34:21.801 --> 34:24.260
is setting up a lab in the GCPD,

34:24.293 --> 34:28.032
but they are missing one
very, very important element.

34:30.726 --> 34:34.377
So, yes, I am sure that this bozo

34:34.402 --> 34:35.761
is the key to controlling Gotham.

34:35.996 --> 34:37.987

39:10.141 --> 39:12.974
that you only used them.
But I don't know why.

39:14.734 --> 39:18.059
Then know that I have been alive
more years than you can imagine.

39:18.793 --> 39:20.387
That I have seen and done things

39:20.473 --> 39:23.520
that would shake the core
of everything you believe.

39:24.137 --> 39:27.075
That I'm thought to be a demon...

39:28.258 --> 39:29.751
a saint...

39:30.860 --> 39:32.360
a ghost.

39:32.837 --> 39:36.877
But for all my years, all my travels,

39:37.522 --> 39:40.350
there is one thing
that I have never found:

39:41.335 --> 39:43.250
a true heir.

39:43.991 --> 39:45.776
But I need to know if you're ready.

39:46.542 --> 39:47.855
I am.

39:48.776 --> 39:50.090
The Sensei trained me.

39:51.355 --> 39:52.784
Are you?

39:53.558 --> 39:55.196
He set you a task.

39:55.969 --> 39:58.156
He asked you to be the one
that released the virus

39:58.219 --> 39:59.953
that now envelops this city.

40:00.266 --> 40:01.680
You failed.

40:01.937 --> 40:04.271
I would have. But...

40:05.018 --> 40:07.377
but Alfred, he distracted me.

40:07.479 --> 40:09.002
I know.

40:10.784 --> 40:12.184
I know.

40:12.309 --> 40:14.448
And that's why I'm gonna
give you another chance

40:14.473 --> 40:16.176
to complete your journey.

40:17.987 --> 40:19.253
(Alfred grunts)

40:22.758 --> 40:25.259

40:25.294 --> 40:27.394
Oh, don't look so surprised,
Master Bruce.

40:27.977 --> 40:30.047
I told you you couldn't
get rid of me that easy.

40:30.227 --> 40:32.727
Just got a bit sloppy.
Got a bit of ring rust.

40:32.935 --> 40:36.203
Let these little ninja monkeys
get one over on me.

40:38.218 --> 40:39.663
You all right, mate?

40:39.909 --> 40:41.442
What you come as?

40:47.850 --> 40:49.450

(snaps fingers)

40:55.077 --> 40:56.490
This man...

40:56.936 --> 40:59.522
is your past, Bruce.

41:00.162 --> 41:02.718
Now, embrace your future.

41:09.207 --> 41:10.621
Kill him.

41:18.496 --> 41:20.080
Join me.

41:22.585 --> 41:24.818
Fulfill your destiny.

41:31.727 --> 41:33.466
He's wrong.

41:34.764 --> 41:36.996
Master Bruce,
there's no other way to put it.

41:37.021 --> 41:38.076
He's wrong.

41:38.373 --> 41:42.114
Your destiny is to be Bruce Wayne.

41:42.747 --> 41:45.856
And one day, you're gonna remember that.

41:47.794 --> 41:50.442
And you're gonna remember
how much I love you.

41:53.330 --> 41:56.483
I remember the first time
your mum and dad brought you home.

41:57.111 --> 41:58.666
They were so exhausted.

41:59.158 --> 42:01.072
And they gave you to me.

42:02.049 --> 42:05.213
This tiny, defenseless little creature.

42:05.580 --> 42:09.252
And they said, "Look after him,"
and I said, "Sure."

42:09.307 --> 42:11.400
And I scooped you up in my arms,

42:11.700 --> 42:14.935
and I held you,
and you opened your eyes...

42:18.060 --> 42:19.951
...and you looked at me.

42:22.678 --> 42:25.357
And at that moment, I decided

42:25.933 --> 42:28.566
that I would do anything for you.

42:28.652 --> 42:29.817
Anything.

42:36.557 --> 42:38.822
So, if this is what you need to do,

42:39.533 --> 42:41.744
Master Bruce, you crack on.

42:44.807 --> 42:46.546
You do it.

secret calls inside the GCPD.

52:19.086 --> 52:20.853
Now hand him over.

52:29.616 --> 52:30.629
Go!

52:42.162 --> 52:46.232
Let him go! Let him go!
We need to get Tetch!

52:54.615 --> 52:55.881
Now!

53:02.797 --> 53:03.829
(tires screeching)

53:05.664 --> 53:07.679
That little bastard!

53:08.366 --> 53:11.276
NURSE: Coming through.
Move out of the way. Rita, move.

53:15.125 --> 53:17.114
All right, let's have a look.

53:17.244 --> 53:19.244
Whoa. What did you do to cauterize this?

53:20.116 --> 53:22.951
I don't, I don't know.
Is he going to be okay?

53:22.976 --> 53:26.265
We'll do everything we can.
What's your relationship to the patient?

53:26.530 --> 53:28.336
NURSE: Doctor, BP's falling.

53:30.258 --> 53:31.812
We're family.

53:31.914 --> 53:34.634
DOCTOR: All right, let's get him
tight, cross-set and prepped for OR.

53:39.220 --> 53:42.471
It looks pretty good.
I'll call the station.

53:46.439 --> 53:48.305
Grab Tetch!

53:54.081 --> 53:55.214
(door closes)

53:57.225 --> 53:58.824
BARBARA: Split up.

54:06.092 --> 54:07.792
(singsongy): Jim.

54:09.240 --> 54:10.796
Jim.

54:12.185 --> 54:15.146
You and the ex are infected, huh?

54:15.879 --> 54:19.394
I've heard Lee wants to remove
my pretty little head

54:19.543 --> 54:21.340
from my body.

54:22.176 --> 54:24.701
Is it weird that kind of
makes me like her?

54:25.012 --> 54:28.725
You thinking about ripping
anyone's head off, Jim?

54:29.076 --> 54:30.816
I bet you are.

54:30.851 --> 54:31.920
(amplified heartbeat)

54:31.972 --> 54:33.405
You're so close.

54:33.487 --> 54:35.988
The next time you give in,
the virus will have you.

54:36.023 --> 54:37.156
Stop talking.

54:37.191 --> 54:39.436
- Jim!
- (Jervis laughs)

54:39.952 --> 54:42.194
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

54:42.458 --> 54:43.908
BULLOCK (whispering): Hey.

54:44.014 --> 54:46.412
There's no back door, no loading
dock, no way this ends well.

54:46.436 --> 54:49.249
The virus will give you
all the strength you need.

54:49.428 --> 54:50.936
It's the only option.

54:51.392 --> 54:52.982
(chuckles): Give in to the darkness.

54:53.026 --> 54:54.388
I said...

54:54.435 --> 54:57.017
- <i>Killer.</i>
- stop talking.

54:57.042 --> 54:59.185
You want to kill me, that I can see,

54:59.270 --> 55:02.458
but without my blood,
no antidote will there be.

55:02.505 --> 55:04.938
- Fight it, Jim.
- I don't know if I can.

55:05.383 --> 55:07.742
He's right. We need him.

55:10.313 --> 55:12.664
Yeah, but not all of him.

55:13.627 --> 55:14.726
(muffled whimper)

55:14.762 --> 55:16.762
(Jervis screams)

55:17.979 --> 55:19.412
BARBARA: Where are they?!

55:19.678 --> 55:20.722
What happened?!

55:20.757 --> 55:22.257
(groans)

55:22.292 --> 55:23.658
(pants)

55:25.462 --> 55:27.028
What'd he do?

55:29.183 --> 55:31.004
Oh, Jim.

55:31.386 --> 55:33.574
You sick bastard.

55:34.370 --> 55:35.728
Where's the lab tech?

55:36.293 --> 55:37.572
Where's the lab tech?!

55:37.707 --> 55:39.385
Come on, come on. Here, here.

55:40.385 --> 55:41.505
What?

55:41.549 --> 55:44.635
You've never seen a mason jar
filled with blood before? Go!

55:44.713 --> 55:46.517
Back to work.

55:47.010 --> 55:48.564
You okay?

55:48.729 --> 55:50.829
(skin crackling)

55:57.837 --> 56:00.004
(sirens wailing)

56:05.445 --> 56:07.733
(groans): Oh. Oh.

56:07.834 --> 56:09.928
OSWALD: He's awake.

56:10.416 --> 56:12.045
I was getting lonely.

56:12.229 --> 56:13.328
Where are we?

56:13.398 --> 56:15.758
Oh, we ran into a police blockade.

56:15.840 --> 56:17.473
Had to hunker down a minute.

56:17.812 --> 56:19.357
Where are you taking me?

56:20.351 --> 56:21.797
I don't know.

56:22.028 --> 56:24.061
I'm sort of improvising here.

56:24.243 --> 56:26.079
Why? You have someplace you have to be?

56:26.199 --> 56:27.519
Does it matter?

56:28.372 --> 56:31.073
I imagine you're planning on
dragging this out.

56:31.167 --> 56:36.044
There are so few moments
of pure joy in one's life,

56:36.114 --> 56:38.982
I feel compelled to savor this one.

56:39.193 --> 56:40.872
You mean gloat?

56:41.685 --> 56:43.080
Yes, I do.

56:43.747 --> 56:47.071
It was always one of your least
attractive qualities, Oswald.

56:47.805 --> 56:49.387
It's killing you, isn't it?

56:49.578 --> 56:50.633
What?

56:50.696 --> 56:54.325
To know that you are not
as smart as you think you are.

56:54.532 --> 56:57.898
(chuckles) All of that
planning to drive me crazy,

56:57.992 --> 56:59.593
strip me of everything I had,

56:59.797 --> 57:02.461
revealing yourself with a "ta-da,"

57:02.558 --> 57:04.135
and shooting me by the river.

57:05.638 --> 57:07.793
That plan was perfect...

57:08.301 --> 57:09.667
and you know it.

57:10.699 --> 57:12.371
You failed.

57:12.965 --> 57:14.566
I am still alive,

57:14.660 --> 57:17.940
and you are handcuffed in the backseat.

57:18.084 --> 57:22.994
And now you will never be able
to correct your mistake.

57:25.053 --> 57:26.820
I guess not.

57:29.355 --> 57:30.988
GILZEAN: Now that they have
Tetch's blood,

57:31.012 --> 57:32.975
they can make the antidote;
and after what we tried to pull,

57:32.999 --> 57:34.343
the whole city's
gonna be gunning for us.

57:34.367 --> 57:36.714
Hell, I'm surprised the cops
haven't busted down our door already.

57:36.738 --> 57:38.469
Relax. They've got better things to do.

57:39.392 --> 57:40.972
What are we supposed to do now?

57:41.007 --> 57:43.118
We split up, go to the
safe house, and regroup.

57:43.189 --> 57:45.309
GILZEAN: Regroup? For what?!

57:45.345 --> 57:47.613
For whatever the hell I tell you to do!

57:49.849 --> 57:51.883
(door opens, closes)

57:51.918 --> 57:53.803
I'm not waiting anymore.

57:53.967 --> 57:56.795
She's broken every promise
she's ever made to you...

57:56.856 --> 57:58.366
- to us.
- I know.

57:59.061 --> 58:01.092
Safe house is a perfect place to do it.

58:02.975 --> 58:04.328
Okay.

58:04.639 --> 58:06.122
I'll take care of everything.

58:06.147 --> 58:07.319
No.

58:08.951 --> 58:10.334
We do it together.

58:16.014 --> 58:17.647
Yeah.

58:20.780 --> 58:23.214
(yelling)

58:24.550 --> 58:26.784
(amplified heartbeat)

58:30.083 --> 58:31.589
- Whew.
- (heartbeat slows)

58:32.052 --> 58:34.135
Kowalski and Burrows
are gonna be pissed.

58:34.336 --> 58:36.414
Uh, Tetch's blood is good.

58:36.484 --> 58:39.288
The lab guys are starting work
on an antidote as we speak.

58:39.313 --> 58:40.904
I need to get to Lee. How long?

58:40.961 --> 58:43.781
- How long before it's ready?
- They said we could head there now.

58:47.031 --> 58:49.524
- Where is it?
- Detective Gordon, just in time.

58:49.549 --> 58:51.349
If you'll take a seat
and roll up your sleeve.

58:51.573 --> 58:53.167
We have a dose ready for you right now.

58:53.362 --> 58:54.812
The others will be ready shortly.

58:55.211 --> 58:56.914
I need two.

58:57.150 --> 59:00.441
Sorry. We could only make one of
these single shots so quickly.

59:00.466 --> 59:02.169
No. Two.

59:02.232 --> 59:04.156
TECH: All of Tetch's blood
is in the centrifuge machines.

59:04.180 --> 59:06.057
- The process can't be interrupted.
- <i>You're a killer.</i>

59:06.081 --> 59:07.681
BULLOCK: It's just
one or two hours, max.

59:07.924 --> 59:10.034
You can still catch Lee
before she leaves.

59:10.698 --> 59:12.158
There's not enough time.

59:12.198 --> 59:13.705
- (screams)
- Jim.

59:13.809 --> 59:16.268
- <i>Killer!</i>
- Jim. Don't make me... Jim!

59:16.322 --> 59:18.104
No, Jim! Jim!

59:18.369 --> 59:20.504
Damn it! Someone call the bullpen!

59:25.511 --> 59:27.078
(indistinct announcements over P.A.)

59:34.865 --> 59:35.976
Bruce.

59:37.967 --> 59:39.862
I heard about Alfred.

59:41.010 --> 59:43.182
Is he gonna be okay?

59:45.964 --> 59:47.565
Go home, Selina.

59:47.792 --> 59:49.198
What happened?

59:49.526 --> 59:50.821
No.

59:51.829 --> 59:53.773
- No, you don't get to do this.
- Do what?

59:53.798 --> 59:55.352
Walk back into my life.

59:55.462 --> 59:57.294
You think I need your pity? I don't.

59:57.364 --> 59:59.841
- That's not why I'm here.
- You want to know what happened?!

01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:06.300
- You wouldn't understand.
- Why?

01:00:06.867 --> 01:00:09.570
Because I'm-I'm not desperate
to believe in something?

01:00:09.605 --> 01:00:12.414
Because you don't believe in
anyone or anything but yourself.

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:16.533
It's called surviving.

01:00:17.142 --> 01:00:19.158
And unlike you,

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:21.916
I know who I am.

01:00:22.603 --> 01:00:24.424
I don't need anyone to tell me.

01:00:25.618 --> 01:00:27.822
What are you even doing here, Selina?

01:00:27.994 --> 01:00:29.535
You don't give a damn about Alfred,

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:31.675
and you sure as hell
don't care about me.

01:00:34.183 --> 01:00:36.526
I know you better than that.

01:00:37.194 --> 01:00:38.979
Yeah.

01:00:40.112 --> 01:00:41.943
I thought you did.

01:00:45.236 --> 01:00:47.060
Have a nice life.

01:00:53.363 --> 01:00:55.058
Lee?

01:00:55.679 --> 01:00:58.180
(amplified heartbeat)

01:00:58.613 --> 01:01:01.027
I don't like to be kept waiting.

01:01:06.628 --> 01:01:08.698
You're still fighting it.

01:01:11.977 --> 01:01:13.977
I can help you with that.

01:01:16.748 --> 01:01:18.648
We both know that's not what I want.

01:01:20.226 --> 01:01:22.648
I want you.

01:01:23.359 --> 01:01:26.796
I want you and all your darkness.

01:01:27.476 --> 01:01:29.058
Give in.

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:33.196
Give in to your darkness.

01:01:33.406 --> 01:01:35.120
Be free.

01:02:06.159 --> 01:02:08.721
Don't you get tired of making
the same mistake over and over?

01:02:10.455 --> 01:02:12.043
You think I'm making a mistake?

01:02:12.221 --> 01:02:14.238
Instead of killing me
when you had the chance,

01:02:14.597 --> 01:02:17.652
you've decided to feed your ego.

01:02:17.777 --> 01:02:21.503
(chuckles):
You want to talk ego? Riddler?

01:02:22.003 --> 01:02:25.516
You will always fail, Oswald.

01:02:25.959 --> 01:02:30.091
Because you will always let
your base emotions drive you.

01:02:30.537 --> 01:02:31.889
Hate,

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.427

- Shut up.

You want to know why I could never

01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:41.576
- love someone like you, Oswald?
- I'm warning you.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:45.290
Because you are a spoiled child
who throws a tantrum

01:02:45.315 --> 01:02:47.658
any time he doesn't get what he wants!

01:02:48.838 --> 01:02:51.909
Especially when what he wants
doesn't want him back.

(Oswald grunts, tires screeching)

01:02:59.118 --> 01:03:01.369
You're right. I shouldn't have waited.

01:03:01.454 --> 01:03:04.182
But, unlike you, I am in the position

01:03:04.237 --> 01:03:06.283
to rectify my mistake.

01:03:07.932 --> 01:03:11.596
Prepare for one massive tantrum.

That is not possible!

01:03:27.013 --> 01:03:30.173
It is my turn!
It is my turn to kill you!

01:03:30.227 --> 01:03:32.259
- Like I said...
- (gasps)

01:03:32.923 --> 01:03:36.938
...you will always fail!

01:03:37.415 --> 01:03:39.564
Because you'll never change.

01:03:39.986 --> 01:03:41.579
Maybe.

01:03:41.915 --> 01:03:44.626
But at least I know who I am.

01:03:45.267 --> 01:03:47.398
That day, by the edge of the river,

01:03:47.433 --> 01:03:50.204
that was the moment you were reborn.

01:03:50.269 --> 01:03:53.337
And that was a lie!

01:03:53.634 --> 01:03:57.241
You're entire persona is based

01:03:57.306 --> 01:03:58.822
on a lie!

01:03:58.877 --> 01:04:02.158
And there is nothing
you can do to change that!

01:04:05.276 --> 01:04:07.109
Actually...

01:04:07.937 --> 01:04:09.750
maybe there is.
