WEBVTT

00:03.320 --> 00:04.833
I find it sad.

00:05.240 --> 00:06.992
What? What are you talking about?

00:07.080 --> 00:08.274
Mr. Woolsey.

00:08.360 --> 00:10.190
- He seems lonely.
- He does?

00:10.279 --> 00:12.747
He never takes part
in any of the city's social activities.

00:12.839 --> 00:15.797
- Please. I mean...
- He always eats alone,

00:15.879 --> 00:17.278
either in his office or in his quarters.

00:17.359 --> 00:20.828
Maybe he has work to do, you know?
Some of us are busy people.

00:21.718 --> 00:23.629
Sometimes, when I walk by
his quarters at night,

00:23.718 --> 00:25.595
- I hear him crying.
- What?

00:26.878 --> 00:28.277
- Really?
- No.

00:30.517 --> 00:34.226
Mr. Woolsey, would you care to join us?

00:35.637 --> 00:37.070
Well, thank you,

00:37.717 --> 00:39.627
but I'll be taking breakfast
in my quarters today.

00:39.716 --> 00:43.709
I still have some final preparations
for my impending performance evaluation.

00:44.276 --> 00:46.585
- I'm a little apprehensive.
- You shouldn't be.

00:46.676 --> 00:49.712
You've done a wonderful job
as our new commander.

00:49.915 --> 00:52.270
Well, let's hope the IOA agrees.

00:53.075 --> 00:55.953
There you go. He prefers to be on his own.

00:56.635 --> 00:59.068
Speaking of which, where's Sheppard?

00:59.594 --> 01:02.904
He flew some astrobiologists
to the mainland this morning.

01:02.994 --> 01:05.224
And volunteered to stay
with them overnight.

01:05.674 --> 01:07.744
He did? Why would he do that?

01:10.673 --> 01:13.062
This planet's sun is a class-G star.

01:13.753 --> 01:17.541
That fact, coupled with
its Earth-like atmospheric composition,

01:17.713 --> 01:21.068
results in the predominance
of green, photosynthetic organisms.

01:23.072 --> 01:25.905
Chlorophyll, of course, mostly absorbs
the sun's blue and red wavelengths,

01:25.992 --> 01:27.789
reflecting green ones.

01:27.952 --> 01:29.304
"But hang on a minute,"
you're probably thinking.

01:29.391 --> 01:32.906
"That's strange. Why doesn't
chlorophyll absorb green light?"

01:33.791 --> 01:35.986
Yeah. Weird. Well, why doesn't it?

01:36.071 --> 01:38.824
Well, the answer lies not so much in the...

01:39.311 --> 01:40.584
Wait here.

01:42.750 --> 01:45.218
- What happened?
- Look at this.

01:46.150 --> 01:48.744
<i>It's a plant not unlike
the begonia eiromischa.</i>

01:50.189 --> 01:52.749
Oh, God, Lorne warned me about this.

01:52.829 --> 01:55.024
You don't understand.
The woolly-stalked begonia

01:55.109 --> 01:58.021
went officially extinct
back on Earth in 2007.

01:58.349 --> 02:00.020
And yet here we are,

02:00.108 --> 02:02.941
standing over a species
that's shockingly similar...

02:03.028 --> 02:04.746
I'm going to go back to the Jumper
and set up for the night.

02:04.828 --> 02:06.341
And it's thriving in a climate that is...

02:06.428 --> 02:07.941
Want to join me?

02:08.907 --> 02:10.818
It's a very unusual find.

02:11.026 --> 02:12.142
Right.

02:12.427 --> 02:15.703
Well, knock yourself out.
That's what we're here for.

02:16.427 --> 02:18.895
Take your time. We're here all night.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:12.455 --> 04:15.765
- Can I give you a hand with that?
- Actually, if you wouldn't mind...

04:16.855 --> 04:18.493
- Hello.
- Hi.

04:18.575 --> 04:21.372
- Where are you headed?
- Back to my quarters.

04:21.934 --> 04:26.086
- The southeast pier. Level 19.
- Penthouse suite. Nice.

04:26.414 --> 04:29.531
- Have we met?
- Not yet. I'm Vanessa Conrad.

04:31.253 --> 04:33.721
- Dr. Vanessa Conrad.
- Richard Woolsey.

04:33.813 --> 04:35.326
<i>I just recently arrived on the Apollo.</i>

04:35.413 --> 04:37.768
- Welcome to Atlantis.
- Thank you.

04:37.853 --> 04:39.332
It's beautiful and huge.

04:39.413 --> 04:42.324
It's probably going to be weeks
before I know my way around.

04:42.412 --> 04:43.845
Well, I'm sure

04:44.812 --> 04:47.770
the gang at orientation
will help you settle in.

04:48.532 --> 04:50.602
I'm sorry. I'm keeping you.
Southeast pier, Level 19.

04:50.692 --> 04:53.808
No, not at all. I have all the time in the...

04:58.811 --> 05:01.006
- This is you, I believe.
- Right.

05:01.091 --> 05:03.285
Well, nice to meet you, Doctor.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.768
Vanessa. You can call me Vanessa.

05:07.210 --> 05:09.678
Very well. Nice to meet you, Vanessa.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.404
- Thank you, Mr. Woolsey.
- Actually, you can call me...

05:14.489 --> 05:15.558
Dick.

05:38.087 --> 05:39.122
Crap.

05:43.966 --> 05:45.957
Hey. What happened
to your offworld foofaraw?

05:46.046 --> 05:49.243
I thought you were the guest of honor
at some big diplomatic dinner on M2J?

05:49.326 --> 05:51.282
Yeah, I was, but the festivities ended early

05:51.366 --> 05:53.196
when three members
of Lieutenant Donovan's team

05:53.285 --> 05:55.162
suffered a severe allergic reaction

05:55.245 --> 05:57.634
to something that we were served
at the grand banquet.

05:57.725 --> 05:58.760
Come to think of it,
I think it might have been

05:58.845 --> 06:01.564
those little green berries
with the purple specks on them,

06:01.645 --> 06:03.714
because my tongue did feel
a little bit numb afterwards.

06:03.804 --> 06:06.113
Yeah. FYl, this conversation
ended six seconds ago.

06:07.004 --> 06:08.960
Anyway, on the way back, I had an idea.

06:09.044 --> 06:13.321
- Have a little lie-down. It'll pass.
- No, you should hear me out.

06:16.443 --> 06:18.434
I think we should run a scan
of the ocean floor.

06:18.523 --> 06:20.241
I've been noticing
anomalous temperature variations

06:20.323 --> 06:21.881
in the waters surrounding the city.

06:21.963 --> 06:24.396
- I think it bears further investigation.
- Not really.

06:25.122 --> 06:27.636
We head through the gate every day
exploring distant worlds,

06:27.722 --> 06:30.316
and yet, with the exception
of a few marine biology tests,

06:30.402 --> 06:32.915
we have barely scratched the surface
of the very planet that we occupy.

06:33.001 --> 06:34.434
That's 'cause there's nothing there.

06:34.521 --> 06:36.477
My point is,
is it wouldn't hurt to be thorough.

06:36.561 --> 06:40.236
My point is your point is pointless
and a giant waste of time.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.832
Damn it.

06:58.999 --> 07:00.432
Xiao, welcome.

07:03.438 --> 07:05.554
Atlantis welcomes you.

07:07.678 --> 07:10.238
It is with great pride that I...

07:14.797 --> 07:17.027
- Hello, Richard.
- Xiao.

07:18.597 --> 07:20.667
Welcome to Atlantis,

07:21.717 --> 07:23.388
with great pride.

07:24.916 --> 07:27.384
I'm looking forward to the grand tour.

07:27.476 --> 07:30.115
- Well, then, shall we?
- Yes.

07:39.355 --> 07:41.391
This is the Control Room.

07:41.675 --> 07:44.984
For all intents and purposes,
the city's nerve center.

07:45.954 --> 07:49.151
These technicians are the very best
at what they do.

07:50.474 --> 07:54.591
- How's the kickboxing going, Amelia?
- Great, sir. Thanks for asking.

07:55.753 --> 07:57.903
- Hello there, Chet.
- It's Chuck.

07:58.313 --> 07:59.302
Excuse me?

07:59.393 --> 08:01.145
It's Chuck, sir. My name is Chuck.

08:01.233 --> 08:04.190
Of course. Chuck. Chet's on the late shift.

08:08.752 --> 08:10.310
There is no Chet.

08:11.152 --> 08:13.427
I think it would be a simple matter

08:13.511 --> 08:16.105
of reconfiguring the city's short-range
sensors in order to achieve...

08:16.191 --> 08:19.024
You know, I can see your lips moving,
but I'm not hearing any sound.

08:19.111 --> 08:21.227
It would take less than an hour

08:21.311 --> 08:23.108
to make the necessary adjustments
that we would have to do.

08:23.191 --> 08:26.262
All right, you know what?
If it is so simple and so important to you,

08:26.350 --> 08:28.739
why don't you just go ahead
and do it yourself?

08:28.830 --> 08:31.185
- Because I require your authorization.
- You got it.

08:31.270 --> 08:32.861
Thank you, Rodney.

08:34.068 --> 08:36.981
You realize it's highly unlikely
you're actually going to find anything.

08:37.068 --> 08:39.059
Well, then I would have wasted
an hour of my time,

08:39.149 --> 08:41.424
and you'll be able to tell me,
"I told you so. "

08:41.509 --> 08:43.897
If, on the other hand, I do find something,

08:43.988 --> 08:47.185
perhaps they'll name something after me
for a change.

08:51.028 --> 08:54.224
The prospect of commanding the Atlantis
expedition was a daunting one.

08:54.307 --> 08:58.061
Dr. Weir and Colonel Carter
were incredibly tough acts to follow.

08:58.147 --> 09:00.024
Yet you availed yourself nicely, Richard,

09:00.107 --> 09:01.938
and you survived your nine months here.

09:02.027 --> 09:04.904
Well, I like to think I've accomplished
a little more than mere survival,

09:04.986 --> 09:07.341
and I'm certain that once you've had
a chance to review my report...

09:07.426 --> 09:09.337
That won't be necessary.

09:10.026 --> 09:13.905
- So I'm receiving my graduation papers?
- Of course.

09:14.225 --> 09:17.023
In recognition of the great job
you've done here,

09:17.105 --> 09:21.098
the IOA is appointing you as chair
of Earth's new environmental initiative.

09:21.865 --> 09:25.095
Congratulations, Richard.
You're coming home.

09:26.784 --> 09:29.981
All right, short-range sensors
are good to go.

09:30.504 --> 09:32.017
Start the sweep.

09:32.504 --> 09:34.062
Sweep initiated.

09:34.383 --> 09:38.058
Great. So it should take about 30 minutes
to scan the entire planet,

09:38.143 --> 09:40.213
which means I've got plenty of time
to get down to the cafeteria

09:40.303 --> 09:42.658
and get myself some of that
fine almond biscotti and a Yoo-hoo,

09:42.743 --> 09:45.256
and be back in time for you to tell me
you have found nothing.

09:45.942 --> 09:47.739
We found something.

09:51.262 --> 09:53.059
Yes, of course we did.

09:55.981 --> 10:00.054
Whatever it is, it's sitting approximately
1,500 feet below sea level.

10:28.658 --> 10:30.011
Hello, John.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.372
Kolya?

10:40.697 --> 10:42.528
I don't understand your reaction.

10:42.617 --> 10:45.085
Nine months ago,
you were dreading coming over here.

10:45.176 --> 10:48.134
A lot has changed in nine months.
I like it here,

10:48.936 --> 10:53.088
and quite frankly, I don't like the idea
of leaving a job unfinished.

10:54.696 --> 10:58.847
I've done good work.
My record speaks for itself.

10:59.655 --> 11:01.452
What's really going on?

11:02.375 --> 11:05.969
The IOA is concerned about
some of the decisions you've made,

11:06.334 --> 11:08.370
decisions that have run
counter to protocol

11:08.454 --> 11:10.763
and, quite frankly, common sense.

11:10.894 --> 11:14.887
They...
We feel that the demands of this position

11:14.974 --> 11:18.249
have compromised your judgment,
and it's time for a change.

11:21.453 --> 11:22.772
Right here.

11:26.052 --> 11:27.371
That'll do.

11:28.372 --> 11:30.408
I wonder how long it's been down there.

11:30.492 --> 11:34.041
To think it would have remained
undiscovered if we hadn't have...

11:34.132 --> 11:36.281
Nice job on reconfiguring
the short-range sensors.

11:36.371 --> 11:37.724
Thank you.

11:37.811 --> 11:39.961
Nice job on the wild guess.

11:40.131 --> 11:42.042
- Thank you.
- Shall we?

11:42.211 --> 11:43.246
Yes.

11:44.771 --> 11:48.285
Keep looking. There's nowhere
for them to go. They're scientists.

11:48.370 --> 11:50.759
Trust me, they don't run very fast.

11:52.970 --> 11:54.528
You're awake.

11:55.410 --> 11:58.606
Save your energy.
You're not getting away this time.

11:59.489 --> 12:00.922
I killed you.

12:01.409 --> 12:05.084
- You shot me. There's a difference.
- No. I killed you.

12:05.889 --> 12:09.483
- Beckett confirmed it. You were dead.
- Yeah, I'm sure that's what he thought.

12:09.568 --> 12:11.798
Let's just say your friend...
What was his name? Lucius?

12:11.888 --> 12:15.244
He wasn't the only one
using Ancient technology that day.

12:15.968 --> 12:17.719
How did you get here?

12:19.527 --> 12:21.245
How did you find us?

12:21.327 --> 12:25.798
Turns out some of your offworld contacts
aren't as trustworthy as you think.

12:25.967 --> 12:27.957
Your secret's out, Sheppard.

12:31.366 --> 12:34.995
A half day's walk in that direction
will bring us to the edge of the mainland.

12:35.086 --> 12:39.522
I figure it'll take us maybe two days
to reach Atlantis by boat.

12:41.125 --> 12:43.685
Before you even get to the city,
they're going to blow you out of the water.

12:43.965 --> 12:46.320
No. They won't even see us coming.

12:46.404 --> 12:48.679
They'll be too busy counting their dead.

12:50.044 --> 12:51.955
What are you going to do?

12:54.284 --> 12:58.162
Send an explosive through your gate,
cripple the city's defenses.

12:59.003 --> 13:01.676
But for that,
I'm going to need something from you.

13:01.763 --> 13:05.073
I think you call it an IDC.

13:05.723 --> 13:07.360
- Go to hell.
- Yeah,

13:07.442 --> 13:09.717
I thought you would need
some convincing.

13:23.321 --> 13:25.835
Dr. Conrad. Vanessa. Come in.

13:25.921 --> 13:28.229
- I hope I'm not intruding.
- Not at all. What brings you by?

13:28.320 --> 13:30.754
This may be wholly inappropriate,
but I was wondering

13:30.840 --> 13:33.354
- whether you'd like to catch a movie.
- A movie?

13:33.440 --> 13:34.998
They're screening
two of my favorites tonight.

13:35.080 --> 13:38.549
<i>Planes, Trains & Automobiles
and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.</i>

13:39.399 --> 13:43.438
Truth be told, I'm having a horrible day,
and I'm not in much of a laughing mood.

13:43.519 --> 13:45.271
Then we can wait until tomorrow,

13:45.359 --> 13:48.668
<i>when they'll be screening
Mad Money and Kangaroo Jack.</i>

13:52.438 --> 13:56.989
- Is it something you'd like to talk about?
- It seems the time for talk has passed.

13:58.517 --> 14:02.510
I've just been informed that I'm being
relieved of my command here on Atlantis.

14:02.597 --> 14:04.553
I'm sorry. Why?

14:05.437 --> 14:08.872
Apparently, I'm not very good
at toeing the company line.

14:09.916 --> 14:12.908
I assumed I got this position
on the strength of my record,

14:12.996 --> 14:15.385
but now it's clear that the only reason
they appointed me

14:15.476 --> 14:18.831
is because they expected
I would just roll over for them.

14:19.195 --> 14:20.947
- Then don't.
- What?

14:21.395 --> 14:23.386
Don't roll over for them.

14:23.675 --> 14:25.393
- Fight this.
- I can't.

14:25.755 --> 14:27.710
The decision's been made.

14:27.914 --> 14:31.065
If that was true, then why didn't
they just forward you a communique

14:31.154 --> 14:32.303
instead of sending a mouthpiece

14:32.394 --> 14:34.783
on a three-week journey
to the Pegasus Galaxy?

14:46.553 --> 14:49.942
Did you really expect me
to just give up without a fight?

14:50.952 --> 14:52.465
Honestly? Yes.

14:52.792 --> 14:55.226
I assumed you'd let common sense
guide you on this one.

14:55.312 --> 14:57.223
You weren't sent here to fire me.

14:57.312 --> 14:59.267
You were sent here
to evaluate my performance

14:59.351 --> 15:02.388
and make a recommendation
based on your findings.

15:02.831 --> 15:04.662
The IOA may be leaning a certain way,

15:04.751 --> 15:07.311
but they have yet to make
a decision on my fate.

15:07.391 --> 15:09.620
Yet you, their representative,

15:11.190 --> 15:12.703
clearly have,

15:15.430 --> 15:18.819
which leads me to assume
something else is going on here.

15:20.429 --> 15:22.943
Someone in the IOA wants me gone

15:23.029 --> 15:25.702
and is using you
to make sure that happens.

15:28.708 --> 15:32.462
Tell me, Xiao,
what are you getting in return?

15:40.507 --> 15:42.941
It's my job, isn't it?

15:44.307 --> 15:48.538
They've promised you the Atlantis
command if you help them get rid of me.

15:49.386 --> 15:53.459
This will all go a lot easier
if you just accept where this is going...

15:53.546 --> 15:56.344
- The hell I will.
- Richard, I hold all the cards.

15:56.426 --> 16:00.020
The decision is in my hands.
This is a fight you cannot win.

16:12.544 --> 16:15.661
You can tolerate more
than any man I've ever known.

16:16.704 --> 16:18.262
Now, why is that?

16:19.183 --> 16:21.139
Well, I was married once.

16:25.903 --> 16:29.338
You're here in the Pegasus Galaxy
to protect your people,

16:29.422 --> 16:31.890
but half the time you can't even do that.

16:32.662 --> 16:37.019
That's what drives you, isn't it?
Your past failures.

16:42.181 --> 16:46.459
Do you think by not giving me the IDC,
you're keeping your people safe?

16:46.741 --> 16:49.095
You're just putting off the inevitable.

16:49.180 --> 16:51.489
It's over. You can't protect them.

16:51.940 --> 16:53.658
You, those scientists,

16:54.420 --> 16:58.379
your friends back at Atlantis,
they're as good as dead.

17:02.059 --> 17:04.778
Well, I see that asking nice isn't working.

17:06.419 --> 17:08.887
I'm going to have to make other plans.

17:11.738 --> 17:15.571
<i>- Two men report to my position.
- On our way.</i>

17:17.458 --> 17:19.253
In a couple of minutes,

17:19.696 --> 17:22.494
you're going to wish
you'd given me that IDC.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.935
What are you working on?

17:27.017 --> 17:30.133
According to this, the device is emitting
a low-level energy signature

17:30.216 --> 17:32.252
- in an oscillating pattern.
- Is it dangerous?

17:32.336 --> 17:33.815
No, radiation's minimal, but...

17:33.896 --> 17:36.330
Unimportant.
We should be focusing on the data.

17:36.416 --> 17:40.090
I was. Like, I've run every kind of
decrypt sweep I can think of at this thing.

17:40.175 --> 17:42.689
Still nothing. I don't know what to do.

17:42.775 --> 17:44.686
- You'll think of something.
- Really?

17:44.775 --> 17:47.812
- What makes you so sure?
- Because you're brilliant.

17:47.895 --> 17:49.566
That's true. Doesn't mean I'm going to...

17:49.654 --> 17:52.043
Wait a minute. What did you say?
Why did you say that? What are you, sick?

17:52.134 --> 17:55.968
- Am I sick? What've you heard?
- No, nobody's sick, Rodney.

17:56.054 --> 17:59.251
I said you're brilliant, because you are.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.773
I rarely say it, because
you're a difficult man to compliment.

18:02.853 --> 18:05.003
You're egotistical.
You're arrogant. You're stubborn...

18:05.093 --> 18:09.245
- And brilliant.
- Yes, Rodney, and brilliant.

18:09.333 --> 18:14.042
Right. Well, pull up a chair, Radek.
We've got some work to do.

18:14.292 --> 18:15.645
All right.

18:16.252 --> 18:20.529
Tell me what plan B is,
or are you just going to surprise me?

18:21.531 --> 18:22.964
I'm going to have my men
repair the damage

18:23.051 --> 18:26.760
they did to your Puddle Jumper,
then use it to attack the city.

18:27.011 --> 18:29.571
Well, I hate to be Mr. Negative,
but I can think of

18:29.651 --> 18:31.959
at least one problem
you're going to run into.

18:32.050 --> 18:35.599
Yes, I know all about the Ancient gene
needed to operate the Jumper,

18:35.690 --> 18:40.126
but that's not going to be a problem
because you're going to give us a hand.

18:40.609 --> 18:41.803
Hold him.

18:49.489 --> 18:53.720
Last chance, Johnny boy.
You going to give me that IDC?

18:58.168 --> 18:59.681
Didn't think so.

19:20.286 --> 19:22.196
You're an interesting man, Sheppard.

19:22.285 --> 19:24.162
You travel to another galaxy,

19:24.245 --> 19:27.874
risk your life defending a bunch
of people you don't even know.

19:28.245 --> 19:31.520
If you ask me, you're either
someone with a death wish,

19:31.724 --> 19:34.238
or someone running away
from something.

19:35.684 --> 19:38.596
So tell me,
what are you running away from?

19:43.003 --> 19:44.880
- Where have you been?
- All over.

19:44.963 --> 19:46.760
The electromagnetic radiation
this device is giving off

19:46.843 --> 19:48.674
covers the entire city and well beyond.

19:48.763 --> 19:50.560
- I thought you said it wasn't dangerous.
- Well, it's not.

19:50.643 --> 19:53.634
I mean, at least, according to this,
it's operating at a relatively low frequency.

19:53.722 --> 19:56.998
I think, at worst, some people may
experience headaches or trouble sleeping.

19:57.082 --> 19:59.232
Well, then we'll shut it off before bedtime.

19:59.322 --> 20:02.119
In the meantime,
you should be focusing on the data.

20:02.201 --> 20:06.877
I'm not getting anywhere with that,
I mean, despite the fact that I am a genius.

20:07.521 --> 20:09.113
I said you were brilliant.
I didn't say you were a genius.

20:09.201 --> 20:11.270
Same diff. I don't get it.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.080
You know, this script appears to be
a lot less complicated

20:14.160 --> 20:16.037
than many we've encountered.
It's only 12 symbols

20:16.120 --> 20:17.838
in an endlessly repeating
yet varying sequence.

20:17.920 --> 20:19.876
Yeah, I agree.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.590
It's very curious. It's like being asked

20:22.679 --> 20:26.194
to figure out the password
for an alien laptop or something.

20:27.079 --> 20:30.071
I think that if we... What?
What are you doing?

20:30.159 --> 20:32.467
I'm figuring out the alien's password.

20:32.558 --> 20:34.469
- Rodney, I was kidding.
- No, it makes sense.

20:34.558 --> 20:36.150
I mean, every kid with a computer
password-protects.

20:36.238 --> 20:37.990
Why wouldn't an alien?

20:40.838 --> 20:41.952
There.

20:42.397 --> 20:44.353
- Why didn't I see that before?
- What?

20:44.437 --> 20:45.552
The pattern isn't in the text.

20:45.637 --> 20:49.391
It's in the space between the text,
each exactly 12 symbols in length.

20:49.477 --> 20:52.786
Each section of text is a multiple of 12,
24, 48, 96,

20:52.876 --> 20:55.071
separated by a 12-symbol space.

20:55.396 --> 20:59.275
- Look, it's a puzzle. It's a prompt.
- What are you doing?

20:59.356 --> 21:01.426
I'm running pattern recognition software
on the 12-symbol sequence.

21:01.516 --> 21:03.551
Hopefully, I can come up
with a 12-symbol permutation

21:03.635 --> 21:05.990
that I can feed directly back
into the device,

21:06.075 --> 21:10.307
and if I'm right...
If we're right, we unlock the alien laptop.

21:21.434 --> 21:24.505
- You poached my private spot.
- What?

21:24.873 --> 21:28.752
What I meant to say is
you discovered my little personal area.

21:32.432 --> 21:35.390
This is where I come
to be alone with my thoughts.

21:35.472 --> 21:37.940
- Do you mind sharing it?
- Not at all.

21:41.752 --> 21:43.230
It's beautiful.

21:47.071 --> 21:49.301
I wish I could stay here forever.

21:51.431 --> 21:54.581
By the way,
I wanted to thank you for earlier today.

21:55.630 --> 21:58.428
- I took your advice.
- Are they backing down?

21:59.230 --> 22:02.063
Unlikely. But at the very least,

22:02.150 --> 22:05.459
I have the satisfaction of knowing
I went out swinging.

22:07.069 --> 22:09.060
You're a good man, Richard.

22:10.309 --> 22:12.617
I really wish they could see that.

22:13.868 --> 22:17.178
Vanessa, would you like
to have dinner with me tonight?

22:17.668 --> 22:19.545
It would be my pleasure.

22:21.348 --> 22:22.621
Wonderful.

22:23.227 --> 22:25.616
What time should I swing by
to pick you up?

22:25.707 --> 22:28.096
It might be easier if we just met up.

22:29.587 --> 22:33.864
Mr. Woolsey, you're off radio.
Dr. McKay needs to see you right away.

22:44.385 --> 22:45.943
That is the historical, scientific

22:46.025 --> 22:49.142
and technological records
of an extinct civilization,

22:49.225 --> 22:52.661
and if this device is any indication,
a highly advanced one at that.

22:52.745 --> 22:55.417
Medical breakthroughs,
specifications for advanced weaponry...

22:55.504 --> 22:57.620
- This is incredible.
- It is.

22:58.784 --> 23:01.856
- I sense a "but. "
- No, no, no. No, no, no. No "buts. "

23:01.944 --> 23:04.503
- A "by the way," maybe.
- I'm listening.

23:04.743 --> 23:08.133
It's like I said, the device contains
the records for a long-dead civilization,

23:08.223 --> 23:12.535
but it also contains the chemical building
blocks for a silicon-based life form.

23:12.623 --> 23:14.897
- What does that mean?
- This device was designed

23:14.982 --> 23:19.612
to seed planets with organisms that
would, in time, evolve into a sentient race.

23:19.822 --> 23:22.814
Once that sentient race reached
a certain level of intellectual maturity,

23:22.902 --> 23:23.970
they could then benefit
from the information

23:24.061 --> 23:27.371
left for them by their extinct ancestors.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.931
- So what happened?
- I'm not sure.

23:30.261 --> 23:31.853
I mean, obviously,
they didn't complete their journey.

23:31.941 --> 23:33.373
I mean, they ended up here instead.

23:33.460 --> 23:36.133
<i>Still, with the help of the Daedalus,
we could ensure</i>

23:36.220 --> 23:39.178
that it finally reached
its target destination.

23:39.860 --> 23:42.852
Okay, let's copy the data,
and then send it on its way.

23:42.940 --> 23:45.328
Which is where the "by the way" comes in.

23:45.419 --> 23:48.013
Look, this device is set up in such a way

23:48.099 --> 23:49.930
that accessing the data
would do irreparable damage

23:50.019 --> 23:51.850
to the biological samples.

23:51.939 --> 23:54.008
In other words, it's either / or?

23:54.098 --> 23:57.215
Either we take the data,
or we send it on its way.

23:57.298 --> 23:58.856
We can't do both.

24:03.418 --> 24:05.328
You disappoint me, John.

24:05.537 --> 24:08.176
I didn't think you'd be this easy to break.

24:08.337 --> 24:11.454
Even those two scientists you came with
put up more of a fight

24:11.537 --> 24:13.289
before we killed them.

24:14.656 --> 24:16.965
Just another two you couldn't save.

24:17.736 --> 24:19.055
We're done.

24:20.896 --> 24:21.931
- It's operational?
- Yes,

24:22.016 --> 24:24.210
we used the genetic material to initiate it.

24:24.295 --> 24:27.287
You hear that, Sheppard?
We've got the Jumper.

24:28.335 --> 24:30.485
Sir, we can come back and deal with him
once we're done with Atlantis.

24:30.575 --> 24:34.089
No. We deal with him now.
Find him and kill him.

24:40.094 --> 24:42.972
Hello, Ellen. Hello, you.

24:43.694 --> 24:46.002
Amelia, could you please do me a favor

24:46.093 --> 24:48.607
and pass on a message
to Dr. Vanessa Conrad?

24:48.693 --> 24:50.490
She's in one of the science departments.

24:50.573 --> 24:53.292
Please tell her that,
given Dr. McKay's recent findings,

24:53.373 --> 24:56.682
we may have to reschedule
our dinner tonight.

24:58.852 --> 25:00.968
Dr. Conrad? Are you sure, sir?

25:01.212 --> 25:03.885
Better yet, why don't you just tell me
where her quarters are?

25:03.972 --> 25:07.043
I suppose it's only proper
that I tell her personally.

25:07.131 --> 25:10.521
- There's nothing here, sir.
- She hasn't been assigned quarters yet?

25:10.611 --> 25:14.240
No, sir, according to this,
there's no Dr. Conrad on Atlantis.

25:37.568 --> 25:42.244
Amelia, the woman I was talking to
when you approached me earlier today.

25:42.488 --> 25:44.240
- Sir?
- On the balcony.

25:45.327 --> 25:49.639
The woman I was speaking with when you
delivered the message from Dr. McKay.

25:49.727 --> 25:51.843
She probably left before I got there, sir.

25:51.927 --> 25:55.123
When I approached you on the balcony,
you were alone.

26:15.884 --> 26:18.079
There's nothing wrong with you.

26:18.284 --> 26:20.161
- What's going on?
- I'll let you know in a second.

26:20.244 --> 26:23.759
- I'm just looking over your results.
- She won't find anything.

26:24.924 --> 26:27.517
According to this, you're fine.
Perfectly normal.

26:27.603 --> 26:30.037
- See?
- Then what is going on?

26:30.123 --> 26:31.522
Why isn't your name in the database?

26:31.603 --> 26:34.322
Why couldn't Amelia
see you earlier today?

26:34.443 --> 26:37.434
I'm pretty sure my name
is in the database.

26:37.522 --> 26:39.672
And as for Amelia,
if she has a medical concern,

26:39.762 --> 26:41.559
there's no reason
why she shouldn't see me.

26:41.642 --> 26:44.793
- When did she come by?
- She can't see me, Richard.

26:45.721 --> 26:47.439
Only you can see me.

26:48.081 --> 26:49.150
Why?

26:49.241 --> 26:51.516
I'd like to clarify the misunderstanding.

26:51.601 --> 26:54.399
I don't want her thinking
I turned her away.

26:54.601 --> 26:56.875
Amelia's fine. I'll talk to her.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.075
Great.

27:00.640 --> 27:02.073
As for you,

27:03.040 --> 27:05.270
you said you've been feeling unwell?

27:05.360 --> 27:07.031
That's right.

27:07.599 --> 27:10.272
- Tired?
- Somewhat.

27:10.559 --> 27:14.347
Any visual symptoms?
Shadows or flashes in your field of vision?

27:18.758 --> 27:21.591
- Sort of. Yes.
- What about auditory symptoms?

27:21.678 --> 27:23.873
Occasional ringing
or buzzing or whistling?

27:23.958 --> 27:25.471
We need to talk.

27:25.598 --> 27:28.634
- Yes. The occasional buzzing.
- Somewhere private.

27:29.517 --> 27:31.189
There it goes again.

27:33.077 --> 27:35.386
I bet you haven't been sleeping very well,

27:35.477 --> 27:38.229
what with this whole probationary review.

27:38.396 --> 27:40.387
Of course. That's it exactly.

27:40.476 --> 27:41.909
You're obviously under a lot of stress,

27:41.996 --> 27:45.705
and sometimes anxiety
can manifest itself in a variety of ways,

27:45.796 --> 27:49.708
but these are going to help you relax
and sleep through the night.

27:49.795 --> 27:52.628
And hopefully, once you're well-rested,
you'll be feeling much better,

27:52.715 --> 27:53.864
and your symptoms will disappear.

27:53.955 --> 27:56.468
But if they don't, come back and see me.

27:56.554 --> 27:58.829
- Okay?
- Thank you, Doctor.

27:59.674 --> 28:01.790
I wouldn't advise taking those.

28:10.713 --> 28:12.305
How long have you been standing there?

28:12.393 --> 28:14.702
Sorry. I just didn't want to disturb you.

28:14.793 --> 28:17.067
- You seemed deep in thought.
- I'm always deep in thought.

28:17.152 --> 28:20.269
Keeps me sharp and sleepless.

28:21.312 --> 28:22.506
So, what are you working on?

28:22.592 --> 28:24.389
I'm just analyzing the readings
from the radiation

28:24.472 --> 28:26.746
- the device is emitting.
- Jeez, again with the radiation.

28:26.831 --> 28:29.106
Hey, I'm just killing time
till Woolsey gives us the green light

28:29.191 --> 28:31.659
to start data retrieval on that thing.

28:31.751 --> 28:34.504
- You think he will?
- Of course. This is huge.

28:34.591 --> 28:38.424
The chronicled achievements
of an alien race, are you kidding me?

28:40.030 --> 28:43.500
- Wait a minute.
- What?

28:44.190 --> 28:46.908
The modulated, ultra-low frequency
emanating from the device.

28:46.989 --> 28:49.423
I've seen something like this before.

28:51.469 --> 28:52.618
Oh, no.

29:19.426 --> 29:21.098
I'm sorry I made you doubt your sanity.

29:21.186 --> 29:23.097
Who are you? What are you?

29:23.946 --> 29:25.345
I'm a physical manifestation

29:25.426 --> 29:28.383
of your subconscious romantic
and sexual ideals.

29:30.625 --> 29:31.819
Oh, God.

29:32.945 --> 29:35.664
You're not crazy. You're really seeing me.

29:36.865 --> 29:39.173
- Why?
- I'm sorry I had to deceive you,

29:39.264 --> 29:42.540
but the survival of an entire civilization
is at stake.

29:43.304 --> 29:47.660
This has something to do with that
device Dr. McKay recovered, doesn't it?

29:49.263 --> 29:52.653
- Richard?
- She can't see me.

29:57.422 --> 29:58.457
Yes?

30:02.382 --> 30:05.021
I thought I heard you
talking with someone.

30:05.422 --> 30:06.457
No.

30:06.822 --> 30:09.130
I was running through the pep talk

30:09.221 --> 30:11.815
I'm going to be giving
the gang in microbiology.

30:11.901 --> 30:13.050
Really?

30:13.501 --> 30:17.937
You know, I saw you on the balcony
this afternoon talking with yourself.

30:19.980 --> 30:24.337
I occasionally do verbalize my thoughts.
It helps me put things in perspective.

30:24.420 --> 30:27.650
A casual observer might find that
sort of behavior a little disconcerting,

30:27.739 --> 30:29.889
especially coming from someone
in your position

30:29.979 --> 30:32.015
faced with a very important decision.

30:33.419 --> 30:35.171
Another nail in my coffin?

30:35.259 --> 30:37.454
Dr. McKay briefed me
on the device he recovered...

30:37.539 --> 30:39.813
- Yes, it is an impressive find.
- ... that doesn't belong to you.

30:39.898 --> 30:41.854
Please sit down.

30:45.698 --> 30:47.609
He tells me you've delayed
giving the go-ahead

30:47.698 --> 30:49.210
on the data retrieval.

30:49.297 --> 30:53.085
I'm not sure if Dr. McKay explained
the dilemma we're facing.

30:53.497 --> 30:56.250
I can't even believe you're considering
letting this slip away.

30:56.337 --> 30:58.406
- There are other issues to consider.
- Such as?

30:58.496 --> 31:01.693
- The fate of another race.
- Will you stay out of this?

31:03.136 --> 31:05.047
I will do no such thing.

31:05.656 --> 31:06.884
Their civilization is dead.

31:06.976 --> 31:08.966
Ours, on the other hand,
is very much alive,

31:09.055 --> 31:10.408
and we could use that information.

31:10.495 --> 31:14.010
We'd be robbing a civilization
of the opportunity to rebuild itself.

31:14.095 --> 31:16.245
There's no guarantee
that a civilization will evolve

31:16.335 --> 31:17.734
from the seeding process.

31:17.815 --> 31:21.329
The entire race could die out
before it even reached sentient status.

31:21.414 --> 31:24.247
And we would be throwing away
an incredible opportunity.

31:24.334 --> 31:29.885
Or consigning billions of potential lives
to oblivion.

31:33.533 --> 31:36.252
I can't believe your good fortune, Richard.

31:36.493 --> 31:38.801
This is your opportunity
to show the team back home

31:38.892 --> 31:40.689
that you can play ball.

31:40.772 --> 31:43.081
Follow procedure and save your job,

31:44.412 --> 31:48.087
or you can hand it to me
on a silver platter. Your choice.

32:25.328 --> 32:28.718
- How dare you threaten me?
- It's not a threat, Richard.

32:29.247 --> 32:32.239
I'm simply telling you
how things are going to play out

32:32.327 --> 32:34.841
- if we lose that device.
- Richard, please.

32:34.927 --> 32:38.442
They were a kind and peaceful race,
one well worth saving.

32:39.126 --> 32:40.525
We need to get rid of it!

32:40.606 --> 32:42.244
The energy signature
that device is giving off

32:42.326 --> 32:44.681
is very similar to one
we encountered on M1B-129.

32:44.766 --> 32:47.963
- It can induce mass hallucinations.
- Or function as a means of communication

32:48.046 --> 32:50.434
between two very different species.

32:52.565 --> 32:54.157
Let's act quickly.

32:54.285 --> 32:56.640
Salvage the data and destroy the device.

32:56.725 --> 32:59.921
Thank you all, both, for enlightening me.

33:00.004 --> 33:02.154
I'll make my decision shortly.

33:02.404 --> 33:03.553
Please.

33:10.403 --> 33:13.839
Now, why don't you tell me
what's going on?

33:14.923 --> 33:17.995
This has gone on long enough.
Use your other hand.

33:19.362 --> 33:20.477
Go on.

33:23.122 --> 33:25.682
I have no intention of letting you die.

33:26.882 --> 33:28.793
Now, climb back up, John.

33:33.801 --> 33:35.075
That's it.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.115
What the hell's going on here?

33:52.039 --> 33:55.793
Tens of thousands of years ago,
a civilization foresaw its end.

33:56.879 --> 33:58.915
After millions of years of evolution,

33:58.999 --> 34:01.751
the race known as the Sekkari
faced extinction.

34:01.838 --> 34:03.590
Knowing they couldn't save themselves,

34:03.678 --> 34:06.795
they spent their final days
creating the means to start over.

34:06.878 --> 34:09.949
They built seed carriers,
each with a different target world

34:10.036 --> 34:12.232
programed into its navigation system,

34:12.317 --> 34:15.309
worlds that would provide them
with the chemical compounds necessary

34:15.397 --> 34:17.991
to produce, sustain and develop life.

34:19.157 --> 34:21.147
Each seed carrier also held a repository

34:21.235 --> 34:23.795
containing the history
of the Sekkari people,

34:23.876 --> 34:26.150
their struggles, their achievements
and the mistakes

34:26.235 --> 34:27.748
that ultimately led
to their own destruction.

34:28.275 --> 34:31.233
The seed carriers were outfitted
with subspace communicators

34:31.315 --> 34:34.466
designed to alert the group
once a seeding was successful.

34:34.554 --> 34:37.194
Over 50 were launched.
None achieved their goal.

34:37.635 --> 34:41.024
This unit malfunctioned.
I guided it to the nearest planet,

34:41.114 --> 34:44.663
this world, in the hope that it would prove
suitable to the life-forming process.

34:45.634 --> 34:46.703
It wasn't.

34:46.793 --> 34:49.752
This device survived re-entry
relatively unscathed,

34:49.833 --> 34:52.666
then spent the next 2,000 years
at the ocean's bottom,

34:52.753 --> 34:55.745
until recently,
when its dormant systems were awakened

34:55.833 --> 34:57.551
by its sensors picking up trace readings

34:57.633 --> 34:59.669
from one of your submerged
Puddle Jumpers.

34:59.753 --> 35:02.949
The one Dr. McKay flew up out of
the underwater bay several weeks ago.

35:03.032 --> 35:05.990
I scanned your city, and I linked with you.

35:07.232 --> 35:08.665
What are you?

35:08.872 --> 35:11.544
I'm the seed carrier's artificial intelligence.

35:11.631 --> 35:14.429
My aim was to study you,
to get to know you,

35:14.511 --> 35:17.344
and eventually direct you
to help complete this unit's assignment.

35:17.431 --> 35:18.784
- By manipulating me.
- No.

35:18.871 --> 35:20.543
By finding out
what kind of person you were

35:20.631 --> 35:23.667
in the hope that
we could place our trust in you.

35:23.910 --> 35:26.265
Couldn't you have simply
communicated your situation to us

35:26.350 --> 35:27.988
from the beginning?

35:28.070 --> 35:31.778
Please understand,
I am the last hope of the Sekkari people.

35:32.549 --> 35:35.746
I couldn't risk it. I'm sorry.

35:37.989 --> 35:39.945
As a soldier, you were a threat.

35:40.029 --> 35:42.098
If anyone was to use force
to secure the repository,

35:42.188 --> 35:44.702
it would have been you, the military man.

35:44.788 --> 35:47.746
So I connected with your mind
to distract you.

35:47.988 --> 35:49.341
Distract me?

35:50.148 --> 35:52.217
Making me think the Jumper
had been sabotaged

35:52.307 --> 35:53.660
would've been enough of a distraction.

35:53.747 --> 35:55.817
You would have discovered
the subterfuge.

35:55.907 --> 35:58.421
I'm unable to maintain
a static illusion over time.

35:58.507 --> 36:01.066
It was necessary
to keep your mind occupied.

36:01.146 --> 36:03.341
- And that's what you chose?
- What you chose.

36:03.426 --> 36:05.576
I didn't have full control
over your hallucination

36:05.666 --> 36:07.418
or the direction it took.

36:07.506 --> 36:11.703
It was your mind driving the diversion.
I merely played along.

36:11.865 --> 36:15.744
- Are you saying I tortured myself?
- You torture yourself every day, John.

36:15.825 --> 36:19.181
But in this case, it was your mind
manifesting your darkest fears.

36:19.265 --> 36:22.301
You were the architect
of your own self-deception.

36:25.304 --> 36:29.377
Now you know the truth
and have a decision to make.

36:34.423 --> 36:35.458
Colonel, where were you?

36:35.543 --> 36:36.692
Do you know how long
we've been sitting here...

36:36.783 --> 36:38.774
Shut up. Get in the Jumper.

36:44.062 --> 36:45.814
<i>Sorry to disturb you, Ms. Shen,</i>

36:45.902 --> 36:48.541
<i>but you've just received
a secure transmission from Earth.</i>

36:48.622 --> 36:51.136
<i>- Can I patch it through?
- Go ahead.</i>

36:54.341 --> 36:56.650
<i>- Luthor, how are things?
- Well.</i>

36:57.221 --> 37:00.657
<i>But I felt it only fair to inform you
of recent developments here.</i>

37:01.461 --> 37:03.451
<i>As much as I believe
you'd be a worthy candidate</i>

37:03.540 --> 37:05.371
<i>to replace Richard Woolsey,</i>

37:05.460 --> 37:08.179
<i>I'm afraid the rest of the council
feels otherwise.</i>

37:08.260 --> 37:11.013
<i>It looks like we'll be going
with James Coolidge instead.</i>

37:11.100 --> 37:12.930
<i>- Coolidge?
- Don't worry.</i>

37:13.379 --> 37:16.689
<i>You'll still be rewarded
for facilitating the transition.</i>

37:16.779 --> 37:18.132
<i>Congratulations.</i>

37:18.219 --> 37:21.689
<i>You'll be chairing the IOA's
new environmental initiative.</i>

37:31.178 --> 37:33.133
Well, I'm off.

37:34.177 --> 37:36.054
I suppose I'll be joining you shortly.

37:36.137 --> 37:39.573
Don't make any holiday plans.
You're not going anywhere.

37:39.737 --> 37:41.773
I gave you a glowing review.

37:41.897 --> 37:45.013
And since your future rests
entirely on my report,

37:45.296 --> 37:46.934
I'd like to be the first to congratulate you

37:47.016 --> 37:50.486
as the new permanent commander
of the Atlantis expedition.

37:52.375 --> 37:54.013
I don't understand.

37:55.575 --> 37:57.805
Like you, Richard, I'm nobody's puppet.

37:58.615 --> 38:01.334
They should've thought of that
before delivering yesterday's update.

38:02.934 --> 38:04.208
Good luck.

38:10.774 --> 38:12.604
Yesterday's update?

38:12.693 --> 38:14.763
I don't know what she's talking about, sir.

38:14.853 --> 38:17.606
We haven't had
a scheduled dial out in days.

38:25.812 --> 38:29.168
- Could I have a moment alone, Amelia?
- Yes, sir.

38:32.931 --> 38:37.243
- I assume that you're responsible for that.
- Consider it a going-away present.

38:38.251 --> 38:39.525
Thank you.

38:41.491 --> 38:42.843
All righty.

38:43.330 --> 38:46.925
Here we are, all fixed up and ready to roll.

38:47.210 --> 38:49.360
So what happens to you
when you reach your final destination?

38:49.450 --> 38:50.678
Destination?

38:50.770 --> 38:53.158
You're talking to the Al, aren't you?

38:54.089 --> 38:57.081
I'll start the process
that will give life to the Sekkari,

38:57.169 --> 39:00.844
and then I'll go to sleep
until a time when I'm needed again.

39:03.328 --> 39:07.446
John, I realize it may have been
an unpleasant experience.

39:07.528 --> 39:09.041
Yeah, well, just a little bit.

39:09.768 --> 39:11.406
What, you can see her, too?

39:11.488 --> 39:15.162
And I want you to know I'm sorry
for what you had to go through.

39:16.367 --> 39:18.403
<i>The Apollo is ready to beam.</i>

39:21.207 --> 39:23.595
The ship will take you
to your target planet.

39:23.686 --> 39:25.199
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to complain or anything.

39:25.286 --> 39:27.038
It's just that I have spent
the better part of a day

39:27.126 --> 39:28.161
making sure this was in working order.

39:28.246 --> 39:30.999
It would be kind of nice
to just get a little face time with the...

39:31.086 --> 39:35.203
Here you are, Dr. McKay.
The true form of the Sekkari.

39:40.285 --> 39:41.320
Neat.

39:44.364 --> 39:45.638
Good luck.

39:51.764 --> 39:54.561
- "Neat"?
- What? She caught me off guard.

39:54.643 --> 39:56.235
What did you want me to say?
What would you have said?

39:56.323 --> 39:57.642
"Weird. "

40:03.563 --> 40:06.952
Mr. Woolsey, would you care to join us?

40:07.082 --> 40:09.994
Well, actually, I have some reports to file...

40:10.122 --> 40:12.352
Thank you. I'd love to join you.

40:17.321 --> 40:21.155
So, you really had no idea
that what you were seeing wasn't real?

40:21.241 --> 40:25.438
Trust me, the manifestations
were very convincing, Doctor.

40:25.520 --> 40:26.748
You wouldn't have known.

40:26.840 --> 40:29.274
Well, with all due respect,
I think they knew they couldn't fool me,

40:29.360 --> 40:30.634
so they, you know, didn't bother.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.995
They just concentrated on you two.

40:33.400 --> 40:34.752
You know what I don't get

40:34.839 --> 40:37.148
is the Al thing
revealed itself that morning,

40:37.239 --> 40:41.357
you discover the device that afternoon.
I mean, that's perfect timing.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.395
The Colonel's right.
That was very coincidental.

40:43.479 --> 40:45.548
And I know what you're implying,
okay, but my mind was clear.

40:45.638 --> 40:47.993
All right? That device was found
because of my brilliant thinking

40:48.078 --> 40:51.388
and, as much as I hate to admit it,
a little help from Zelenka.

40:51.478 --> 40:53.469
What are you talking about?
Zelenka's offworld.

40:53.558 --> 40:55.991
No, he's not. He came back yesterday.

40:58.277 --> 41:00.029
Lieutenant Donovan had a nasty reaction

41:00.117 --> 41:02.631
to something he ate.
They came back early.

41:03.477 --> 41:04.829
Didn't they?

41:07.876 --> 41:09.229
Son of a...

41:09.316 --> 41:12.388
I guess it wasn't that much
of a coincidence after all.
