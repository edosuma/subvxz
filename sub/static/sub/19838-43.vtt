00:01.860 --> 00:05.550
<b>Your "remote concealment" strategy</b>

00:05.550 --> 00:08.460
<b>is actually named "kokoriko."</b>

00:09.960 --> 00:11.740
<b>I came up with that strategy...</b>

00:13.290 --> 00:14.990
<b>ten years ago.</b>

00:15.840 --> 00:18.650
<b>I was pretty happy</b>

00:18.650 --> 00:23.820
<b>that a fool like me could figure 
out a smart strategy...</b>

00:25.150 --> 00:27.500
<b>But then, I saw how to defeat it.</b>

00:28.590 --> 00:32.990
<b>That the Supreme Leader thought 
of the same strategy as I had...</b>

00:34.280 --> 00:39.370
<b>I was so honored and touched... 
My heart trembled.</b>

00:40.310 --> 00:41.450
<b>It felt like...</b>

00:43.260 --> 00:46.690
<b>Like seeing my child brought back to life.</b>

00:48.980 --> 00:49.940
<b>Foolishness.</b>

00:50.580 --> 00:51.740
<b>I've had enough.</b>

00:52.270 --> 00:53.590
<b>Get some rest.</b>

00:55.240 --> 00:56.690
<b>Once we begin again,</b>

00:58.110 --> 00:59.800
<b>you won't get any more breaks.</b>

01:00.380 --> 01:01.660
<b>Be prepared!</b>

02:21.990 --> 02:27.000
<b>Resolve x And x Awakening</b>

02:32.200 --> 02:33.440
<b><i>This is upsetting.</i></b>

02:33.920 --> 02:37.520
<b><i>During our matches, I am the only 
one who's getting flustered.</i></b>

02:38.820 --> 02:43.340
<b><i>I would have expected this to be 
humiliating on a new level.</i></b>

02:44.250 --> 02:45.050
<b><i>But...</i></b>

02:45.860 --> 02:51.170
<b><i>At the same time, I am enjoying our matches.</i></b>

02:51.950 --> 02:54.670
<b><i>But I don't understand why...</i></b>

02:58.530 --> 03:02.480
<b><i>That I do not understand my own mind</i></b>

03:02.480 --> 03:04.760
<b><i>upsets me more than words can describe!</i></b>

03:19.910 --> 03:23.070
<b>Did she not choose to rest?</b>

03:23.070 --> 03:23.930
<b>No...</b>

03:30.980 --> 03:32.110
<b><i>Unsightly.</i></b>

03:32.850 --> 03:35.810
<b><i>No sign of intelligence or dignity.</i></b>

03:37.580 --> 03:39.670
<b><i>How can such a being</i></b>

03:39.670 --> 03:43.570
<b><i>boast a Gungi record so stellar 
that it could be called</i></b>

03:43.570 --> 03:45.810
<b><i>the ultimate in game theory?</i></b>

03:52.100 --> 03:53.870
<b>Wake up! We're starting again.</b>

03:54.900 --> 03:56.250
<b>Y-Yes...</b>

04:08.980 --> 04:11.300
<b>9-5-1, marshal.</b>

04:15.300 --> 04:16.230
<b>For this match...</b>

04:16.670 --> 04:17.440
<b>Hmm?</b>

04:19.510 --> 04:21.240
<b>We should make a wager.</b>

04:22.410 --> 04:24.380
<b>A wager?</b>

04:24.950 --> 04:25.750
<b>Correct.</b>

04:26.870 --> 04:31.010
<b>If you win, I shall grant 
any wish you request.</b>

04:32.960 --> 04:35.800
<b>Any wish I request?</b>

04:38.290 --> 04:39.600
<b>Any wish...</b>

04:41.630 --> 04:42.510
<b>However...</b>

04:44.400 --> 04:45.980
<b>If you lose,</b>

04:47.420 --> 04:49.010
<b>I shall take your left arm.</b>

05:04.190 --> 05:06.430
<b><i>Fear and desire hold the power</i></b>

05:08.230 --> 05:10.030
<b><i>to disrupt one's rhythm.</i></b>

05:11.650 --> 05:13.900
<b><i>Desire clouds vision,</i></b>

05:13.900 --> 05:16.180
<b><i>while fear stills one's step.</i></b>

05:19.360 --> 05:21.040
<b>My left arm...</b>

05:23.060 --> 05:25.070
<b>My left arm...</b>

05:28.850 --> 05:30.630
<b>Should I do it?!</b>

05:30.630 --> 05:32.060
<b>Why do you hesitate?</b>

05:32.410 --> 05:36.700
<b>Well... Instead of my left arm...</b>

05:37.480 --> 05:41.570
<b>Is it all right if I bet the thing I usually bet?</b>

05:41.990 --> 05:43.000
<b>What?</b>

05:43.880 --> 05:45.070
<b>What do you bet?</b>

05:46.550 --> 05:48.070
<b>My life.</b>

05:50.850 --> 05:55.360
<b>If I lose, I will offer you my life.</b>

05:55.710 --> 06:00.080
<b>But you might consider that an insult...</b>

06:00.730 --> 06:02.290
<b>I do not understand.</b>

06:02.960 --> 06:05.340
<b>Explain yourself.</b>

06:05.600 --> 06:07.060
<b>Um...</b>

06:07.370 --> 06:12.170
<b>Well, Gungi is really the only thing I can do.</b>

06:12.990 --> 06:16.600
<b>In other words, Gungi is the reason I'm alive.</b>

06:17.390 --> 06:20.370
<b>But professional Gungi players,</b>

06:20.370 --> 06:24.420
<b>even national champions, make but a pittance.</b>

06:25.350 --> 06:29.160
<b>Only after you become the world 
champion as representative for a nation</b>

06:29.160 --> 06:33.090
<b>will you receive any meaningful reward.</b>

06:35.520 --> 06:41.030
<b>To become the national representative, 
you must win tournaments.</b>

06:41.560 --> 06:45.330
<b>In other words, you cannot lose a single match.</b>

06:47.470 --> 06:49.690
<b>I come from a family of twelve,</b>

06:49.690 --> 06:52.100
<b>and in our home, I'm the breadwinner.</b>

06:52.430 --> 06:53.990
<b>If I lose a single match,</b>

06:53.990 --> 06:57.140
<b>I will become the greatest burden on my family.</b>

06:59.030 --> 07:01.430
<b>Gungi players have a saying...</b>

07:01.430 --> 07:06.620
<b>That, after losing once, a Gungi master 
becomes a normal person.</b>

07:07.060 --> 07:08.400
<b>If I lose,</b>

07:08.940 --> 07:10.300
<b>I'll be garbage.</b>

07:11.720 --> 07:13.300
<b>Ah, it doesn't bother me!</b>

07:13.300 --> 07:15.960
<b>It's just what my parents always said...</b>

07:18.550 --> 07:23.120
<b>So, the day I set my sights on 
becoming a professional player,</b>

07:23.120 --> 07:27.300
<b>I decided that if I ever lost a match, 
I would take my own life.</b>

07:31.040 --> 07:34.400
<b>But that could be a problem...</b>

07:34.880 --> 07:35.780
<b>How so?</b>

07:37.160 --> 07:40.450
<b>When I lose, I'll become garbage...</b>

07:40.450 --> 07:44.450
<b>And all you'd receive for 
winning would be garbage.</b>

07:45.510 --> 07:48.200
<b>That would be a terrible insult.</b>

07:48.900 --> 07:50.460
<b>It doesn't bother me.</b>

07:50.880 --> 07:54.820
<b>I'm more interested in learning 
what you'd want if you win.</b>

07:58.110 --> 07:59.820
<b>You see...</b>

08:00.210 --> 08:04.270
<b>I've spent all of my time thinking about Gungi...</b>

08:06.220 --> 08:08.530
<b>I'll think about it later, after I win.</b>

08:09.030 --> 08:10.090
<b>Very well.</b>

08:12.230 --> 08:14.990
<b><i>Then she possesses neither desire nor fear?</i></b>

08:24.600 --> 08:25.940
<b>Your life, was it?</b>

08:26.300 --> 08:29.610
<b>It appears I was the one lacking in resolve!</b>

08:30.930 --> 08:36.120
<b>I never imagined that, if you won, 
you might ask for my life.</b>

08:36.310 --> 08:36.960
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

08:36.960 --> 08:38.050
<b>Silence!</b>

08:40.030 --> 08:42.860
<b>The Supreme Leader's l-liâ€”</b>

08:43.920 --> 08:46.400
<b>I w-would never ask such a thing!</b>

08:46.400 --> 08:49.430
<b>The thought never crossed my mind!</b>

08:49.430 --> 08:50.640
<b>I know that.</b>

08:50.640 --> 08:52.880
<b>The fault is my own.</b>

08:53.340 --> 08:54.630
<b>The wager is off.</b>

08:55.300 --> 08:56.800
<b>It was a petty tactic.</b>

08:58.520 --> 08:59.650
<b>No...</b>

09:07.830 --> 09:09.150
<b>Accept this apology.</b>

09:11.720 --> 09:12.860
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

09:13.770 --> 09:15.400
<b>How could you do that?</b>

09:17.230 --> 09:18.670
<b>I must treat your arm...</b>

09:18.670 --> 09:19.760
<b>Come with me!</b>

09:20.110 --> 09:21.970
<b>Y-Your arm?</b>

09:23.040 --> 09:24.660
<b>Continue the match.</b>

09:24.980 --> 09:26.790
<b>Huh? Huh?</b>

09:26.790 --> 09:28.950
<b>What happened, Supreme Leader?</b>

09:29.580 --> 09:31.730
<b>It's your turn. Make your move.</b>

09:31.730 --> 09:33.920
<b>Your Majesty... We must stop the bleeding!</b>

09:38.780 --> 09:40.180
<b>Do not make me repeat myself.</b>

09:40.610 --> 09:42.240
<b>Continue the match.</b>

09:42.920 --> 09:46.190
<b>It was I who said there would be no more breaks.</b>

09:46.590 --> 09:49.260
<b>Or do you insist that I embarrass myself again?</b>

09:51.660 --> 09:53.880
<b>I shall summon Neferpitou.</b>

09:54.690 --> 09:57.750
<b>I am sure that you can continue to play,</b>

09:57.750 --> 10:00.250
<b>as your arm is reattached.</b>

10:01.320 --> 10:04.700
<b>That is the best compromise I can offer.</b>

10:05.610 --> 10:08.210
<b>If you refuse to accept it,</b>

10:08.720 --> 10:13.460
<b>you may take my head now!</b>

10:17.220 --> 10:18.410
<b>Very well.</b>

10:18.410 --> 10:19.640
<b>Come closer.</b>

10:20.190 --> 10:22.220
<b>I shall end it with a single strike.</b>

10:28.490 --> 10:29.610
<b>It's your turn.</b>

10:30.130 --> 10:30.920
<b>Make your move.</b>

10:30.920 --> 10:31.910
<b>I refuse.</b>

10:32.910 --> 10:36.560
<b>I refuse to move before you 
have your injury treated.</b>

10:39.340 --> 10:41.590
<b>Don't make me repeat myself. 
Make your move.</b>

10:42.000 --> 10:43.190
<b>I refuse.</b>

10:43.810 --> 10:46.500
<b>If you wish to kill me,</b>

10:46.860 --> 10:47.950
<b>use Gungi!</b>

10:50.240 --> 10:51.370
<b>Why, you...</b>

11:01.040 --> 11:02.440
<b>Summon Pitou!</b>

11:02.760 --> 11:03.760
<b>At once!</b>

11:16.740 --> 11:18.390
<b>There's no doubt.</b>

11:18.390 --> 11:20.460
<b>All the puppets have vanished.</b>

11:21.010 --> 11:23.620
<b>Have they resumed the selection process?</b>

11:23.620 --> 11:25.800
<b>No, I doubt it.</b>

11:27.010 --> 11:29.630
<b>We have the capital surrounded.</b>

11:30.350 --> 11:34.650
<b>The King's safety is their top priority. 
They wouldn't leave him.</b>

11:35.390 --> 11:36.750
<b>Then what's going on?</b>

11:37.250 --> 11:41.050
<b>My assumption would be that 
some threat greater than us</b>

11:41.050 --> 11:44.530
<b>has befallen the Royal Guard, 
or upon the King himself.</b>

11:44.840 --> 11:47.840
<b>So this is it?</b>

11:48.890 --> 11:51.290
<b>Our golden opportunity?</b>

11:51.290 --> 11:52.310
<b>Yes...</b>

11:53.390 --> 11:55.740
<b>Our chance to infiltrate the palace.</b>

11:57.180 --> 11:59.760
<b>However, it may be a trap.</b>

12:00.710 --> 12:02.270
<b>That shouldn't be the case...</b>

12:02.270 --> 12:05.980
<b>They wouldn't use any tactic that 
might endanger the King.</b>

12:06.550 --> 12:09.240
<b>They would if the King ordered it.</b>

12:09.970 --> 12:11.190
<b>I suppose...</b>

12:11.550 --> 12:16.110
<b>Regardless, they've retracted 
their long-range radar.</b>

12:16.500 --> 12:19.700
<b>We should use this chance to 
get as close as possible.</b>

12:22.590 --> 12:25.660
<b>I must create a portal near the palace,</b>

12:26.290 --> 12:29.010
<b>or the plan will fail.</b>

12:31.270 --> 12:34.250
<b>This dangerous job had to be done eventually.</b>

12:35.500 --> 12:36.910
<b>And the time is now.</b>

12:43.920 --> 12:44.740
<b><i>There!</i></b>

12:45.480 --> 12:46.720
<b><i>I found them.</i></b>

12:48.390 --> 12:50.750
<b><i>It appears Cheetu failed.</i></b>

12:54.970 --> 12:56.090
<b>Try not to die.</b>

12:56.460 --> 12:58.040
<b>Same to you.</b>

13:00.650 --> 13:02.550
<b><i>They've split up for us.</i></b>

13:05.050 --> 13:06.210
<b>I found them.</b>

13:06.670 --> 13:09.050
<b>We'll switch to the man with the pipe!</b>

13:09.050 --> 13:09.950
<b>Let's go!</b>

13:23.770 --> 13:25.540
<b><i>Doctor Blythe.</i></b>

13:31.970 --> 13:36.330
<b>Toy Repair 
Doctor Blythe</b>

13:39.890 --> 13:42.590
<b>7-9-1, spy.</b>

13:45.870 --> 13:48.090
<b>2-3-1, pawn.</b>

13:49.260 --> 13:52.290
<b>How long will the operation take?</b>

13:53.840 --> 13:57.600
<b>I'd say two or three hours 
until complete recovery.</b>

13:57.960 --> 14:01.710
<b>And during that time, you cannot use 
either your puppets or <i>En</i>, correct?</b>

14:02.570 --> 14:05.610
<b>This ability requires a lot of <i>Nen</i>.</b>

14:06.720 --> 14:10.770
<b>A great deal of energy is needed to recreate flesh.</b>

14:11.550 --> 14:14.620
<b>While you treat His Majesty, 
I shall watch the surroundings.</b>

14:15.160 --> 14:18.040
<b>Though my <i>En</i> is nowhere as effective as yours.</b>

14:18.770 --> 14:23.230
<b>Regardless, this is an important task 
that I cannot trust to anyone else.</b>

14:33.130 --> 14:35.720
<b><i>As expected, I cannot sense any</i> En <i>use...</i></b>

14:38.220 --> 14:40.690
<b><i>The rain helps to lower visibility.</i></b>

14:42.390 --> 14:44.240
<b><i>Soon, the sun will set.</i></b>

14:46.790 --> 14:50.480
<b><i>Once it is night, I can hide in the darkness.</i></b>

14:50.480 --> 14:52.660
<b><i>And picking out enemy aura will be easier.</i></b>

14:54.120 --> 14:55.410
<b><i>Be patient.</i></b>

14:56.540 --> 14:58.660
<b><i>The closer the portal is to 
the palace, the better.</i></b>

14:59.670 --> 15:01.470
<b><i>But if I'm spotted, it will all be useless.</i></b>

15:03.230 --> 15:05.630
<b><i>While I can enter and exit freely,</i></b>

15:07.050 --> 15:11.140
<b><i>Shoot and the rest can only use 
the portal to leave once they enter.</i></b>

15:12.400 --> 15:15.180
<b><i>If the enemy prepares an ambush by the exit,</i></b>

15:15.630 --> 15:17.100
<b><i>it will mean serious trouble.</i></b>

15:27.450 --> 15:32.920
<b><i>I must prepare three exits in the area 
around the palace, one near, one far,</i></b>

15:33.510 --> 15:37.870
<b><i>and one somewhere in between, then 
place entrances even further away.</i></b>

15:38.810 --> 15:43.130
<b><i>I'll set up the entrances in groups of three, 
in locations where the palace is within sight.</i></b>

15:43.130 --> 15:46.380
<b><i>When the mission starts, we can enter 
by the most convenient location.</i></b>

15:48.200 --> 15:50.250
<b><i>Once it's time to act,</i></b>

15:50.250 --> 15:53.360
<b><i>the situation will determine 
whether we approach</i></b>

15:53.360 --> 15:56.990
<b><i>by the near exit, the far exit, 
or the one in between.</i></b>

15:57.640 --> 16:00.970
<b><i>Once that has been determined, we act.</i></b>

16:02.640 --> 16:07.190
<b><i>From the enemy's perspective, 
we will be appearing from nowhere.</i></b>

16:08.230 --> 16:12.430
<b><i>We must use that opening to separate 
the King and Royal Guard.</i></b>

16:14.240 --> 16:16.290
<b><i>That is when our battles will begin!</i></b>

16:19.430 --> 16:21.830
<b><i>It doesn't matter if we finish with a 1-3 record,</i></b>

16:22.500 --> 16:25.240
<b><i>so long as the King is their one loss.</i></b>

16:39.750 --> 16:41.060
<b><i>Under normal circumstances,</i></b>

16:41.060 --> 16:44.380
<b><i>I would already be within 
range of Neferpitou's</i> En.</b>

16:45.840 --> 16:47.860
<b><i>This is quite tense...</i></b>

16:48.840 --> 16:51.360
<b><i>However, I am still far away.</i></b>

16:52.570 --> 16:54.310
<b><i>The farthest exit</i></b>

16:54.310 --> 16:58.910
<b><i>must be on the palace grounds, 
or it won't be any use to us!</i></b>

17:00.660 --> 17:03.500
<b><i>Advance carefully, but swiftly!</i></b>

17:04.690 --> 17:07.320
<b><i>Should I wait for the sun to set?</i></b>

17:07.900 --> 17:11.630
<b><i>But, will this scenario hold out until then?</i></b>

17:13.390 --> 17:14.620
<b><i>I have no choice...</i></b>

17:16.680 --> 17:19.850
<b><i>Should Neferpitou's</i> En <i>return,</i></b>

17:20.490 --> 17:22.770
<b><i>approaching the palace will be impossible.</i></b>

17:26.170 --> 17:29.440
<b><i>If I fail, we still have other options!</i></b>

17:31.810 --> 17:33.480
<b><i>I have nothing to fear.</i></b>

17:34.190 --> 17:35.170
<b><i>Advance...</i></b>

17:36.060 --> 17:37.050
<b><i>Advance...</i></b>

17:43.300 --> 17:44.320
<b>In the palace,</b>

17:44.320 --> 17:48.950
<b>there are three humans not intended as food.</b>

17:50.270 --> 17:52.460
<b>The first is the Gungi player.</b>

17:53.470 --> 17:55.330
<b>The second is Diego.</b>

17:56.330 --> 17:58.430
<b>And the third...</b>

18:02.910 --> 18:04.390
<b>is Secretary Bizeff.</b>

18:06.950 --> 18:11.200
<b>Behind the scenes, he was 
the country's true ruler.</b>

18:12.430 --> 18:16.990
<b>All dealings with foreign parties 
and domestic organizations</b>

18:17.500 --> 18:20.440
<b>went through him as an intermediary.</b>

18:22.820 --> 18:24.750
<b>Since he cannot be replaced,</b>

18:25.230 --> 18:30.110
<b>he is the only human allowed near the King.</b>

18:31.690 --> 18:36.350
<b>No human guards are posted near the palace.</b>

18:37.040 --> 18:41.460
<b>Because ordinary soldiers would 
be powerless against <i>Nen</i> users,</b>

18:41.960 --> 18:45.480
<b>the Royal Guard determined that the 
presence of ordinary soldiers would,</b>

18:45.480 --> 18:47.550
<b>in fact, increase the risk of infiltration.</b>

18:49.770 --> 18:53.900
<b>The only Squadron Leader present 
is Cheetu, who has just returned.</b>

18:54.500 --> 18:57.960
<b>There are only six other Captain and Soldier Ants.</b>

19:00.850 --> 19:02.010
<b>In other words,</b>

19:02.010 --> 19:07.790
<b>there are currently only three humans 
and eleven Ants in the palace.</b>

19:08.790 --> 19:10.750
<b>The Soldier Ants are</b>

19:10.750 --> 19:14.410
<b>the various Squadron Leaders' personal troops.</b>

19:14.410 --> 19:17.050
<b>Thus, they are not involved 
in the King's protection.</b>

19:18.530 --> 19:20.630
<b>Essentially, the Squadron Leaders</b>

19:20.630 --> 19:25.140
<b>no longer have any strict fealty to the King.</b>

19:25.800 --> 19:30.140
<b>They work together simply 
because their goals align.</b>

19:32.370 --> 19:36.000
<b>Understanding this, Pitou and the Royal Guard</b>

19:36.000 --> 19:41.250
<b>have assigned those Chimera Ants tasks 
that are expected to end in failure.</b>

19:41.870 --> 19:45.160
<b>Hence, they would not be trusted 
with monitoring the palace.</b>

19:47.580 --> 19:49.880
<b>However, Knov does not know this.</b>

19:50.290 --> 19:53.890
<b>As he attempts to infiltrate the palace,</b>

19:53.890 --> 19:57.030
<b>he has no idea that this is 
his best, and last, chance.</b>

20:04.600 --> 20:06.680
<b><i>I managed to survive somehow...</i></b>

20:08.310 --> 20:11.220
<b><i>But on my own, I can only work so much.</i></b>

20:13.770 --> 20:15.690
<b><i>I must convince them</i></b>

20:16.340 --> 20:20.050
<b><i>to at least provide three more 
staffers to do secretarial duties...</i></b>

20:20.050 --> 20:21.990
<b><i>Otherwise, I'll die of overwork.</i></b>

20:29.560 --> 20:32.960
<b>Sending list of available bodies.</b>

21:20.100 --> 21:21.340
<b>"Thinker...</b>

21:22.780 --> 21:23.750
<b>Bell."</b>

21:32.330 --> 21:35.760
<b>Per our arrangement, 
I request numbers 2, 16, 79, 103, and 119.</b>

21:42.540 --> 21:43.280
<b>This is it.</b>

21:44.880 --> 21:46.780
<b>He took the bait, Palm-kun!</b>

21:51.950 --> 21:54.540
<b>While Knov works to infiltrate the palace,</b>

21:55.280 --> 22:00.710
<b>Palm is preparing to launch 
her own infiltration plan.</b>

23:24.680 --> 23:26.640
<b>Next time: Knov x And x Morel.</b>

23:26.640 --> 23:29.050
<b>Today, this person is joining me!</b>

23:29.050 --> 23:30.310
<b>Why am I here?</b>

23:30.310 --> 23:31.650
<b>Because Killua isn't around!</b>

23:31.650 --> 23:32.260
<b>Scream.</b>
