[knocking on door]

00:22.939 --> 00:23.815
Oh.

00:23.898 --> 00:25.900
You were supposed to
drop the dog off on Tuesday.

00:25.984 --> 00:28.319
-This is getting ridiculous.
-I've been busy.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.321
-Can I have Lenny, please?
-No, you can't.

00:31.281 --> 00:34.284
-Why not?
-Because he's dead.

00:34.868 --> 00:38.204
He got hit by a car, a Saab,
and I just didn't have time to call you.

00:38.288 --> 00:39.122
I'm sorry.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.332
I know this is probably devastating
for you.

00:41.416 --> 00:44.419
I mean, I've had a week,
so, I've kind of moved through it.

00:44.502 --> 00:47.172
But, uh, I have the number
of the woman that hit him,

00:47.255 --> 00:48.631
if you wanna call her and cry.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.468
Do you wanna call her and cry?
I don't want you to cry here.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.136
[dog yips, whimpers]

00:57.974 --> 00:59.809
[Carolyn] Hey, boy. Oh.

01:01.436 --> 01:04.105
-You belong in an asylum.
-You'd love that, wouldn't you?

01:04.189 --> 01:09.235
Just me all chained up and drooling and--
and lobotomized with my balls cut off.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.279
You never had any balls to begin with.

01:12.864 --> 01:15.200
I did before I married you!

01:16.409 --> 01:18.912
But there's one ball you can't castrate.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.122
That's the mind!

01:21.873 --> 01:26.377
-[typewriter clacking]
-[Sam] <i>Those balls are just...</i>

01:26.961 --> 01:27.921
balls.

01:29.172 --> 01:32.801
A man's<i> true</i> ball...

01:33.384 --> 01:35.261
is the mind.

[upbeat music playing]

02:02.539 --> 02:03.957
Ronnie takes out his pen...

02:04.999 --> 02:06.126
signs the picture.

02:06.709 --> 02:09.462
And he says,
"It's a good thing Bonzo is a Democrat,

02:09.546 --> 02:11.589
otherwise <i>he'd</i> have won the nomination."

02:11.673 --> 02:13.675
[crowd laughing]

02:15.593 --> 02:17.262
You're-- you're hilarious.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.389
Ladies, hi.

02:19.472 --> 02:22.475
I see you've met Sebastian Howard,
our producer.

02:22.559 --> 02:23.643
Uh, "Bash," please.

02:23.726 --> 02:27.021
Just know that he's the one
writing your checks, so, be nice.

02:27.105 --> 02:30.316
I don't like to talk about money, okay?
I'm a patron of the arts.

02:30.400 --> 02:34.529
And wrestling is an art,
despite my mother's opinion,

02:34.612 --> 02:35.697
which is wrong.

02:36.447 --> 02:37.824
[Sam] I thought you were in Peru.

02:37.907 --> 02:41.244
Yeah, I-- I-- I came back early.
Loving the casting!

02:41.327 --> 02:43.872
Even Miss Serious over here. [chuckles]

02:43.955 --> 02:45.999
So, what moves have you guys learned?

02:46.082 --> 02:48.918
We've been learning to fall on our backs
without hurting ourselves.

02:49.502 --> 02:50.336
And pain faces.

02:51.087 --> 02:53.882
What-- what about powerbombs?
Or DDTs?

02:53.965 --> 02:56.676
Salty's famous for his DDTs.
Where is Salty, by the way?

02:56.759 --> 02:59.053
Yeah, yeah, Bash, Salty didn't work out.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.140
Cherry's our new wrestling coach now.

03:03.683 --> 03:07.020
Um... does she have
any wrestling experience?

03:07.103 --> 03:09.022
Um... I'm right here.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.983
Yeah. All right, anyway,
fans are gonna tune in for the moves,

03:12.066 --> 03:15.737
but they're not gonna stay tuned in
unless we give them what, ladies?

03:15.820 --> 03:16.988
-Blood.
-Tits!

03:17.155 --> 03:20.491
-Storytelling. Storytelling.
-Oh.

03:20.575 --> 03:24.495
Now, I know it's exciting to be
in the midst of a big-shot producer,

03:24.579 --> 03:27.457
but I have something even shinier...

03:28.041 --> 03:29.042
A script.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.044
Hot off the Xerox.

03:31.127 --> 03:33.463
I only made ten copies,
so, we have to share 'em.

03:33.546 --> 03:37.258
And I'm just gonna cast as we go along,
starting with Ruth.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.385
Yes! Anything you need.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.638
Uh, yeah.
I need you to read stage directions.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.852
"The year is 1999.

03:47.936 --> 03:51.648
Nuclear war has reduced the Earth
to a smoking ruin.

Lost tribes of women wander the land

03:55.485 --> 04:01.157

04:22.971 --> 04:26.557
I'm sorry, Madame,
but there is a woman outside.

04:26.641 --> 04:30.728
She says she wants to wrestle
for a night with... the Specimen.

04:30.812 --> 04:36.276
"Suddenly, a wall collapses,
and in strides the Leather Virgin,

04:36.359 --> 04:39.904

whose tough-as-nails persona

04:39.988 --> 04:43.866
conceals a deep well
of passion and virginity."

04:44.575 --> 04:46.452
Are you the keeper of the Specimen?

04:46.536 --> 04:48.955
[Tammé] I am. Who are you?

04:49.038 --> 04:50.581
That's no concern of yours.

04:50.665 --> 04:54.168
The only thing you need to know
is that I am ready to fight.

04:54.752 --> 04:57.130
[Tammé] We'll see about that. Ogress!

04:57.213 --> 05:00.091
"Ogress, a giant half-cyborg,
half-woman, enters."

05:00.800 --> 05:01.634
Uh-oh.

05:03.761 --> 05:05.847
Me Ogress. You die now.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.182
All right,
now the next part's just wrestling.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.809
-Yeah.
-[Sam] Wrestle, wrestle, wrestle.

to you.

Wail in agony.

and the Sexecutioner

Oh, yeah, you do it. You do Kuntar.

Okay, okay.

I am Kuntar!

Good God. She's even more disgusting
than they described her.

-Oh, sorry, where is that?
-Oh, it's right here where I'm ad-libbing.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.194
Oh, come on. Stick to the script.

06:43.277 --> 06:45.655
Actually, know what?
Maybe we should take a break.

06:45.738 --> 06:48.491
-We're almost at the end.
-I have a big monologue coming up.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.159
-I could use a break.
-Me, too.

06:50.618 --> 06:51.452
Oh.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.538
All right, all right. Let's take five.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.373
[Rhonda] Do it right.

06:55.456 --> 06:57.125
[women chattering]

06:58.543 --> 07:01.170
So, all right, what did you think, Bashy?

07:01.254 --> 07:02.755
And you can be honest with me.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.510
There is...

07:08.094 --> 07:09.971
so much about this that's working.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.682
A lot.

07:13.266 --> 07:17.019
Well, you hired me to, you know,
do a different kind of wrestling show.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.564
-So, I, you know--
-Mission accomplished.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.024
[Bash sighs]

07:22.108 --> 07:24.402
You know what?
Let's take the rest of the day off.

07:24.485 --> 07:25.987
-Have some drinks.
-Drinks? I--

07:26.070 --> 07:28.448
Yeah, let's not--
Let's have a welcome party.

07:28.698 --> 07:31.200
You know? We're all new.
Let's get to know each other.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.660
Who wants to go to Malibu? Huh?

07:33.327 --> 07:35.788
-[women] I do!
-I can take one more in the chopper.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.499
-[Jenny] I could go. I could go.
-Debbie. My new friend. Hey.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.542
[women sigh]

07:39.625 --> 07:41.627
-[Bash] Let's fly, all right?
-[Jenny] Go have fun.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.715
Hey, hey, Florian! We're throwing a party!

07:46.466 --> 07:49.260
Yeah, I got 20 people
headed your way, okay?

07:51.012 --> 07:54.223
That's my butler. He gets nervous
when I don't give him notice!

07:54.307 --> 07:56.017
I can't hear you, but I agree!

07:59.145 --> 08:00.480
Oh!

08:08.905 --> 08:13.576
Hey, Sam. Sam, so, how important is it
that we all go to this party?

08:13.659 --> 08:16.287
'Cause I was thinking
it might be a better use of my time

08:16.370 --> 08:18.039
to go home and work on my lines.

08:18.122 --> 08:20.500
You know,
see if I can get off-book by tomorrow?

08:20.583 --> 08:23.503
You don't wanna suck up to the producer
like your pal Debbie?

08:24.587 --> 08:27.173
Trying to keep a safe distance
from my pal Debbie.

08:27.256 --> 08:31.177
-It's a party. Don't overthink it.
-Last time I went to a party with Debbie,

08:31.260 --> 08:32.720
I got drunk and slept with her husband.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.972
Well, lucky for you,
he's not invited this time.

08:37.016 --> 08:39.894
-[Jenny] Melrose, can we all fit?
-Oh, no, are you kidding?

08:39.977 --> 08:42.688
Guys, I've had ten strippers
and a baby pool in this puppy.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.733
Cram your asses in here!

08:45.816 --> 08:47.693
[women whooping]

08:48.611 --> 08:49.946
[Melrose] Come on, get in.

08:51.614 --> 08:52.740
I'll ride with you.

08:52.823 --> 08:55.159
-[sighs] You don't have to.
-I know.

08:55.743 --> 08:56.911
It's that one, right?

08:56.994 --> 08:58.037
Yeah.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.455
[Cherry] Hey.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.250
Where was my part?

09:02.875 --> 09:04.043
What do you mean?

09:04.502 --> 09:07.421
In your jerk-off space opera.
You didn't write me a part.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.632
It's a post-nuke dystopia, thank you.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.676
I trained these girls all fucking week.

09:11.759 --> 09:14.095
I watched tapes, I broke down moves.

09:14.804 --> 09:18.391
-I wanna be on camera, Sam. It's my turn.
-Can we not do this now?

09:20.017 --> 09:20.851
Fine.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.146
We'll do it on the way there.

09:27.024 --> 09:29.694
[Sam] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on. What are you doing?

09:30.653 --> 09:33.197
[Justine] There wasn't room in the limo,
and I don't have a car.

09:33.990 --> 09:38.619
Also, may I say that script was
your best work since <i>Blood Disco?</i>

09:38.703 --> 09:40.997
It has the surrealist quality
of your early works

09:41.080 --> 09:43.541
like <i>Oedipussy, Venus in Chains,</i>
<i>Gina the Machina,</i>

09:43.624 --> 09:46.877
but with a more subversive message
about the limitations of feminism

09:46.961 --> 09:48.045
and nuclear power.

09:53.092 --> 09:53.926
Get in.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.350
She gets it.

10:02.852 --> 10:06.439
<i>♪ I heard a voice say</i>
<i>"Tonight by the wood ♪</i>

10:06.522 --> 10:08.858
<i>♪ You will find something unique ♪</i>

10:10.109 --> 10:12.820
[robot] <i>Hello, ladies.</i>
<i>Welcome to the party.</i>

10:13.863 --> 10:15.031
[in robotic voice] Thank you.

10:15.573 --> 10:18.200
Oh. You guys are here. Oh, my goodness.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.995
That is a real Lichtenstein.

10:21.078 --> 10:23.080
Couch made by Picasso.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.540
That one I-- I made up.

10:24.624 --> 10:28.294
The bowls are made of crystal.
Real crystal, not like my mom's glass,

10:28.377 --> 10:30.880
-but she's like, "It's crystal."
-What about the robot?

10:30.963 --> 10:32.632
Yeah, there's a robot, you know?

10:33.299 --> 10:35.885
Ah, there is a robot. It's--
What are these? [chuckles]

10:35.968 --> 10:38.679
Oh, it nodded. I love it. Hello!

10:39.513 --> 10:40.473
[Melrose gasps]

10:45.227 --> 10:47.063
There are drugs in the fuckin' robot.

10:47.563 --> 10:50.775
[Bash] So, not just caviar,
but also fancy mustards or pâté.

10:50.858 --> 10:52.443
-[Sheila] Beef stew?
-We sell that.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.278
-Pork? Venison?
-Yep. Mm-hmm.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.739
-Chicken of the sea.
-We sell canned foods, so...

10:56.822 --> 10:58.324
Anything canned under the sun.

10:58.407 --> 11:01.619
That was almost the Howard Foods slogan.
My idea. I liked it.

11:02.119 --> 11:03.162
Mother, not so much.

11:04.538 --> 11:05.915
Lucky Charms, anyone?

11:05.998 --> 11:07.166
I would love some.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.002
My parents never let me eat sugary cereals
as a kid.

11:10.086 --> 11:13.297
-[Florian] Oh. Have as many as you like.
-Mm, mm. Thank you.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.007
So, this is your butler guy?

11:15.091 --> 11:17.051
[Bash] Oh, yeah, yeah.
Flor is my secret weapon.

11:17.134 --> 11:19.136
We met in third grade.
Now he works for me.

11:19.220 --> 11:22.264
I got plastic forks from Gelson's.
So, we don't have to run the dishwasher.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.975

Really? You? Team Pariah?
You still want the show to happen?

22:20.005 --> 22:21.131
-Yes.
-Why?

22:23.759 --> 22:24.968
It's all I have right now.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.470
Oh, God.

22:26.553 --> 22:30.849
Sam, you're the director.
You're the one with the vision.

22:31.558 --> 22:32.851
We respect you.

22:33.393 --> 22:34.728
We need you.

22:38.106 --> 22:40.567
-But maybe Bash is right, too.
-No, he's n--

22:40.650 --> 22:41.860
I just-- I just mean...

22:42.569 --> 22:45.864
Maybe your script is too complicated.

22:47.449 --> 22:48.784
[sighs]

22:49.368 --> 22:50.744
I'm a homewrecker.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.789
I wrecked someone's home.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.541
Yeah. You did.

22:58.502 --> 23:01.588
But I don't get to play any
of these characters if there's no show.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.054
Goddamnit.

23:31.785 --> 23:32.702
[sighs]

23:33.620 --> 23:35.455
I'm not easy to work with. I know that.

23:35.539 --> 23:36.456
[scoffs]

23:36.540 --> 23:39.793
I'm cranky,
and I don't take criticism well,

23:40.335 --> 23:42.629
and I don't like being told what to do.

23:48.051 --> 23:49.261
Is that an apology?

23:49.845 --> 23:51.429
Apologies, compromise...

23:52.389 --> 23:55.142
not my bag. As my ex-wife will tell you.

23:56.309 --> 24:00.605
I just don't get it. I mean... why'd
you hire me if you don't like my work?

24:00.689 --> 24:03.859
What are you talking about, Sam?
Your fucking movies are hysterical.

24:04.526 --> 24:05.652
They're not comedies.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.529
Oh.

24:13.034 --> 24:14.035
I'll tell you what.

24:17.622 --> 24:18.665
We'll do it your way.

24:19.791 --> 24:20.625
All right?

24:21.209 --> 24:22.460
I'll make your show.

24:23.336 --> 24:24.171
I'll listen.

24:24.796 --> 24:25.630
I'll...

24:26.256 --> 24:27.215
[mutters]

24:27.841 --> 24:29.050
...compromise.

24:30.218 --> 24:31.887
-In return--
-You can't have Florian.

24:31.970 --> 24:35.015
-Okay? He's too valuable to me.
-I don't want your fucking butler.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.433
I want you to read my script.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.518
The one from this morning?

24:39.102 --> 24:42.230
No. No, another one.
I've been trying to get it made for years.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.316
Nobody gets it
and no one wants to pay for it.

24:44.399 --> 24:45.901
I don't need to read it. I'll make it.

24:48.528 --> 24:50.614
You should read it.
It's pretty fucking wild.

24:50.697 --> 24:53.283
There's, like, time travel, Oedipal shit--

24:53.366 --> 24:54.367
Sam, look at me.

24:54.951 --> 24:57.287
You make GLOW, I will make any...

24:58.413 --> 25:01.791
crazy time-travel
sex-romp movie you want.

25:04.961 --> 25:05.837
What's it called?

25:07.380 --> 25:08.715
<i>Mothers and Lovers.</i>

25:09.424 --> 25:10.759
Don't say anything.

25:10.842 --> 25:11.885
I don't want notes.

25:12.636 --> 25:13.720
It's a great title.

25:17.390 --> 25:18.225
Sam, I love it.

25:20.936 --> 25:21.770
It's deep.

25:23.897 --> 25:26.858
[in Chinese accent]
I am one who is cute like panda.

25:26.942 --> 25:30.195
I'm in danger. Help me. Save me.

25:30.278 --> 25:32.447
[laughs] Trick you!

25:32.530 --> 25:35.825
Because I am fast like dragon!

25:35.909 --> 25:37.160
[grunts]

25:37.244 --> 25:39.287
I am Fortune Cookie...

25:40.497 --> 25:42.165
and Asian.

25:43.792 --> 25:44.626
[Bash whistles]

25:44.709 --> 25:46.378
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yep, definitely.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.547
[in growling voice] I'm Beirut,

25:50.173 --> 25:51.716
the Mad Bomber.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.093
[growls]

25:53.677 --> 25:57.681
I will destroy
your American way of living.

25:58.306 --> 26:00.684
You know what? Let's--
let's add the gun back in.

26:03.603 --> 26:04.771
[in normal voice] So expected.

26:04.854 --> 26:07.274
[in raspy voice] I'm Scab,

26:07.357 --> 26:09.901
and I'm your worst nightmare.

26:10.485 --> 26:14.030
I'll gut your Gucci and blast your Beemer.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.116
Die, yuppie scum!

26:16.199 --> 26:18.410
[cackles]

26:18.994 --> 26:19.869
I got chills.

26:20.287 --> 26:21.496
Yeah, you would.

26:22.038 --> 26:27.085
Hi, I'm Melrose. I'm a bad, bad girl
who likes to party, party, party.

26:27.168 --> 26:30.839
[in gruff voice]
And Daddy's been a bad, bad boy!

26:30.922 --> 26:32.465
[growls]

26:33.049 --> 26:34.843
Come here, Daddy!

26:35.677 --> 26:38.680
I think, uh... I should pull back
on the dominatrix thing.

26:38.763 --> 26:39.973
Yeah, just a tad.

26:45.854 --> 26:46.771
I'm Sheila.

26:48.356 --> 26:49.274
Anything to add?

26:50.108 --> 26:52.027
No, I-- I think it's pretty clear.

26:53.528 --> 26:56.239
They call me Machu Picchu,
the Peruvian Fortress.

26:56.323 --> 26:57.866
Strong and proud.

26:58.658 --> 26:59.534
I'm a good guy.

27:00.076 --> 27:01.578
-[Sam] Girl.
-I'm a good girl.

27:03.788 --> 27:04.622
I'm Ju--

27:04.706 --> 27:06.291
[scoffs] What is it?

27:06.374 --> 27:07.584
[Sam] Junkchain.

27:09.502 --> 27:11.504
I'm Junkchain, and I bring the pain.

27:12.630 --> 27:13.673
Peace.

27:13.757 --> 27:15.216
-I'm Ethel.
-I'm Edna.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.843
[both] And we're the Beat Down Biddies.

27:16.926 --> 27:19.220
You want a piece of me?
I got moles older than you.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.973
Oh, yeah, I'll come at you.
I'm like a good fiber cereal.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.600
I'll make you shit your pants!

27:24.517 --> 27:28.563
Y'all stupid for going to work every day
and paying taxes. [scoffs]

27:28.646 --> 27:31.524
I let the government pay
for all of my shit,

27:31.608 --> 27:33.943
and I lives like a queen.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.862
A Welfare Queen.

27:35.945 --> 27:37.906
[laughs]

27:38.573 --> 27:41.159
This is like half my brain,
half your brain.

27:42.285 --> 27:43.453
She's our masterpiece.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.915
Oh, hello.

27:47.457 --> 27:51.920
I didn't see you, because I was looking
at my beaker full of a science experiment.

27:52.420 --> 27:54.839
And earlier, I was doing algebra...

27:55.757 --> 27:58.259
because I'm Britannica...

27:59.386 --> 28:01.846
the Smartest Woman in the World.

28:07.060 --> 28:08.770
[Sam] Throw those on for a second.

28:10.855 --> 28:13.316
-Yeah, that sells it.
-[Bash] Now it makes sense.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.652
I can't see. [chuckles]

28:15.735 --> 28:16.820
I'm a two-time...

28:18.196 --> 28:19.030
Olympic...

28:19.906 --> 28:20.740
medalist...

28:21.658 --> 28:23.118
who loves America.

28:25.203 --> 28:26.413
I'm Liberty Belle.

28:29.666 --> 28:31.376
[whispers] Can I please do this character?

28:31.459 --> 28:35.004
[in Southern drawl] Because I'm a two-time
Olympic medalist who loves America.

28:35.588 --> 28:36.673
I'm Liberty Belle.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.427
I'm the athlete.
Those are my actual medals.

28:41.010 --> 28:42.470
She seemed more all-American.

28:42.554 --> 28:43.430
Just-- We're--

28:43.513 --> 28:46.307
We got a different part for you.
It's a big juicy part.

28:46.391 --> 28:47.517
Why don't I believe you?

28:50.019 --> 28:51.479
I am Vicky Viking.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.315
Yes.

28:54.399 --> 28:57.986
Men... walk in fear

28:58.069 --> 29:00.447
through these city streets.

29:01.197 --> 29:03.658
For it is there you may meet me.

29:04.367 --> 29:06.536
And though I am
only moderately attractive...

29:07.537 --> 29:09.080
I am desperate.

29:09.831 --> 29:14.169
And there's nothing more dangerous
than a desperate woman.

29:14.919 --> 29:19.174
And there is no woman more desperate...

29:20.216 --> 29:21.634
than the Homewrecker.

29:26.097 --> 29:26.973
It's not working.

29:27.557 --> 29:28.433
Yeah.

29:29.058 --> 29:31.770
-Did you want me to push it further, or--?
-[Sam] No, it's just--

29:31.853 --> 29:34.355
-I don't know. The whole thing's--
-[Bash] Yeah, it's like...

29:35.023 --> 29:36.775
-I mean, who is she?
-Yeah. Yeah.

29:36.858 --> 29:37.901
Help us out, Ruth.

29:38.359 --> 29:39.527
Um...

29:39.611 --> 29:40.862
Who do you think you are?
