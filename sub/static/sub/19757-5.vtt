[theme music playing]

00:34.026 --> 00:35.528
[Gus inhales deeply]

00:39.532 --> 00:40.991
- Okay. [chuckles]
- Okay.

00:45.746 --> 00:46.955
[Gus grunts]

00:48.374 --> 00:50.000
[both breathing heavily]

00:51.043 --> 00:53.253
- Do you wanna go get a condom?
- Yeah.

00:53.337 --> 00:54.755
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:04.348 --> 01:05.849
[both chuckle]

01:11.814 --> 01:13.607
- [whirring]
- [both chuckle]

01:14.525 --> 01:16.151
[Mickey moaning]

01:24.327 --> 01:25.911
Hey, can I get your Wi-Fi password?

01:25.994 --> 01:28.706
Oh! Getting a little ahead of yourself.
Aren't you, mister?

01:28.789 --> 01:30.416
Oh, have I jumped out of stage there?

01:30.499 --> 01:32.668
Yeah, I watched half that
Edward Snowden documentary.

01:32.751 --> 01:36.005
- And now I'm very careful.
- [chuckles] Seriously?

01:36.088 --> 01:40.217
- No, it's just easier if I type it in.
- Oh, right. [sniffles]

01:42.761 --> 01:45.348
Hey, I liked waking up
next to you this morning.

01:45.431 --> 01:47.308
You're a peaceful sleeper. I like it.

01:47.391 --> 01:49.935
Oh, yeah, I go into, like,
a super deep trance zone.

01:50.018 --> 01:52.563
- Yeah.
- You are not a peaceful sleeper.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.481
- Oh, no?
- You were very chatty.

01:54.565 --> 01:57.776
[groans] Fuck. I've heard that before.

01:57.860 --> 01:59.111
What did I say?

01:59.194 --> 02:01.822
You were like,
"I'm sorry, Brenda Blethyn."

02:01.905 --> 02:04.491
- And then you started laughing.
- [laughs]

02:05.451 --> 02:07.828
I laughed? Well, that's super creepy.

02:07.911 --> 02:09.913
Mmm, it was. But I liked it.

02:11.289 --> 02:12.416
This is nice.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.584
Yeah.

02:14.585 --> 02:17.254
Wish we could just stay in bed all day.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.840
- Why don't we, huh? You got any plans?
- [sighs]

02:21.174 --> 02:24.177
[smacks lips] I really want to, I do.
But I gotta go to SLAA.

02:24.261 --> 02:25.846
SLAA.

02:25.929 --> 02:27.848
S-L-A-A, that's what they call it.

02:27.931 --> 02:30.684
Ah! SLAA.

02:30.768 --> 02:32.811
- I get it. That makes sense.
- Yep.

02:32.895 --> 02:34.104
What time is it?

02:34.187 --> 02:36.482
[inhales] Now-ish? Sorry.

02:36.565 --> 02:38.609
- It's okay.
- [inhales deeply]

02:38.692 --> 02:42.112
It's good that you're going. Seriously.
You should go. Go, go, go.

02:42.195 --> 02:43.531
Do you want, like...

02:44.490 --> 02:45.991
a fresh T-shirt or something?

02:46.074 --> 02:48.702
[grunts] No, I'm good. Thanks.

02:48.786 --> 02:51.371
You sure? You ran, like,
three miles last night.

02:51.455 --> 02:54.166
Yeah? [sniffs] Ugh! I'm a little ripe.

02:54.249 --> 02:56.669
- Here, this one should fit.
- Okay.

02:59.254 --> 03:00.338
[sighs]

03:01.048 --> 03:03.133
- I'm not tripping still, am I?
- You tell me.

03:03.216 --> 03:04.802
[chuckles] I'm not.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.304
- Oh, that looks cute on you.
- Thank you.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.973
Hey, you know,
you could come with me if you want to.

03:10.474 --> 03:11.559
Really? Is that cool?

03:11.642 --> 03:13.894
- Yeah.
- Like, go into the meeting, or...

03:13.977 --> 03:15.228
No. Wait for me outside.

03:16.439 --> 03:18.023
Yeah! Sure, if that's cool.

03:18.106 --> 03:19.525
As long as you won't get bored.

03:19.608 --> 03:22.986
No. I'll just... hang out in my car,

03:23.070 --> 03:25.823
watch videos of kids coming out
from under anesthesia.

03:25.906 --> 03:26.907
Have you ever seen those?

03:26.990 --> 03:29.284
Uh, really, it's funny,
seeing fucked-up kids.

03:29.367 --> 03:30.911
- [snorts]
- [Gus chuckles]

03:31.995 --> 03:34.331
Ugh. I hate all my clothes. [scoffs]

03:41.379 --> 03:42.590
[sighs]

03:48.261 --> 03:49.972
Mom, how's it goin'?

03:51.389 --> 03:53.183
<i>Is Dad around?</i>

03:54.685 --> 03:55.894
<i>An estate sale?</i>

03:56.729 --> 03:57.730
That's cool.

04:00.941 --> 04:03.318
This is embarrassing,
but I don't remember your name.

04:03.401 --> 04:04.862
[scoffs]

04:04.945 --> 04:07.573
Jorie. J-O-R-I-E.

04:08.824 --> 04:12.369
- Short for Marjorie. Just call whenever.
- Amazing. Thank you, I will.

04:15.622 --> 04:16.622
Okay...

04:17.165 --> 04:20.503
this may be against the rules
or whatever, but...

04:21.462 --> 04:22.588
Yeah? What's up?

04:23.589 --> 04:25.215
I hung out with this guy last night...

04:25.298 --> 04:28.301
and now I really wanna
spend the day with him.

04:29.386 --> 04:31.722
Is that not cool?
Should I not do that?

04:31.805 --> 04:35.183
All right, well, were you honest
with him about SLAA?

04:35.267 --> 04:37.060
- Yeah.
- And he's cool with it?

04:37.144 --> 04:41.273
Yeah. I mean, don't look now,
but he's waiting for me in the car.

04:43.066 --> 04:44.401
He's almost too cool with it.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.404
Yeah. Just hang out with him.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.698
Really? 'Cause I don't wanna
binge on him.

04:49.782 --> 04:52.075
I... I wanna do this right for once.

04:52.659 --> 04:55.621
The program is about learning to be
in a healthy relationship.

04:55.704 --> 04:57.080
And just because you are new

04:57.164 --> 05:01.126
doesn't mean you have to walk away
from something good because of bad timing.

05:01.752 --> 05:02.753
Fuck timing.

05:03.504 --> 05:04.630
Yeah, you're right.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.007
Okay, I gotta go to spin class.

05:07.090 --> 05:09.760
The road to self-improvement
is never ending.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.344
- Bye, Jorie.
- Bye.

05:14.765 --> 05:16.308
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.352
How's it going? How was the meeting?

05:19.436 --> 05:20.979
Or, uh, can I not...

05:21.897 --> 05:23.607
I don't know what I'm allowed to ask.

05:23.691 --> 05:24.817
- It was good.
- Good.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.569
- Thank you for asking.
- Good. Of course.

05:26.652 --> 05:29.863
Cool. Did you, uh,
make some new friends?

05:30.989 --> 05:33.283
- Yes, Mom.
- [both chuckle]

05:33.366 --> 05:35.160
All right. [chuckles]

05:35.243 --> 05:37.454
I just wanna know about you
and your new friends.

05:37.538 --> 05:41.083
If they're coming over, let me know,
and I'll pick up some sodas beforehand.

05:43.543 --> 05:45.003
Do you, uh...

05:47.631 --> 05:48.716
wanna get some food?

05:49.800 --> 05:51.885
Yeah. A little brunch action?

05:51.969 --> 05:53.220
Yeah.

05:53.303 --> 05:54.972
We can do that. Sure.

05:57.015 --> 05:58.015
[sniggers]

05:58.767 --> 05:59.935
What?

06:00.018 --> 06:02.395
I just saw you do your mirror face.

06:02.479 --> 06:04.773
- My mirror face? What is it?
- It was like this.

06:06.399 --> 06:07.484
[chuckling] Yeah.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.570
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I look sexy in the mirror.

06:09.653 --> 06:11.529
- [laughing]
- I gotta know how I look.

06:11.614 --> 06:13.365
Oh, just you wait.

06:13.448 --> 06:17.160
There's gonna come a day
when I catch you doin' your mirror face.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.162
I am gonna relish that shit.

06:27.545 --> 06:28.881
[Mickey] Oh, my God.

06:28.964 --> 06:31.049
- You see that building right there?
- Uh-huh.

06:31.133 --> 06:33.552
That's where my first job in LA was.

06:34.011 --> 06:35.470
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

06:35.554 --> 06:39.808
I was an assistant to this publicist
who repped the entire cast of <i>The Hills.</i>

06:39.892 --> 06:41.101
Oh, that's cool.

06:41.184 --> 06:44.062
Mmm, no. Too much drama.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.691
Isn't that the point of the show? Drama?

06:47.775 --> 06:49.359
Not in real life.

06:49.442 --> 06:51.278
Not when Justin Bobby shows up
at your house

06:51.361 --> 06:53.089
in the middle of the night crying
'cause he's the only one

06:53.113 --> 06:55.282
who wasn't included in the spread
in <i>Teen Vogue.</i>

06:55.365 --> 06:56.867
[chuckles]

06:58.160 --> 06:59.619
Oh, Justin Bobby.

07:00.537 --> 07:02.790
You have no idea
who I'm talking about, do you?

07:02.873 --> 07:03.873
No.

07:05.083 --> 07:08.795
- That makes me like you so much more.
- [chuckles softly] Good.

07:11.381 --> 07:12.758
[Mickey] Do you ever think,

07:12.841 --> 07:14.903
"What would I do if there was
an earthquake right now?"

07:14.927 --> 07:16.887
[Gus] Oh, yeah, all the time.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.222
I guarantee you and me will experience,

07:19.306 --> 07:21.642
like, a huge earthquake
at some point in our lives.

07:21.725 --> 07:23.185
- Really? The big one?
- Mmm-hmm.

07:23.268 --> 07:25.145
Yeah. Because think about it.

07:25.228 --> 07:28.481
We haven't had, like,
a true crisis in Los Angeles in years.

07:28.565 --> 07:31.151
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
- In the '90s, there were the riots,

07:31.234 --> 07:33.696
the Northridge earthquakes, OJ.

07:33.779 --> 07:36.239
- So we're due up for disaster.
- [inhales sharply]

07:36.323 --> 07:39.617
Well, if there is an apocalyptic event,
I will not be helpful.

07:39.702 --> 07:41.912
I will almost certainly make things worse.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.538
Mmm. Stick with me, then,

07:43.622 --> 07:45.916
'cause I have a good plan
if there's a disaster.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.459
Oh, yeah? What is it?

07:47.542 --> 07:49.103
- Immediately kill myself.
- [Mickey] Mmm.

07:49.127 --> 07:51.296
Smart. How you gonna do it?

07:51.380 --> 07:54.257
[Gus] Hmm, jump off the roof
of The Grove parking lot.

07:54.341 --> 07:57.469
So you didn't grow up with, like,
a dream of becoming a teacher?

07:57.552 --> 08:00.472
No. No.
I didn't really wanna be a teacher.

08:00.555 --> 08:02.724
I was always, like, obsessed with, like,

08:02.808 --> 08:05.185
TV shows and movies and stuff.

08:05.268 --> 08:07.163
I even memorized
which studios made which movies.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.772
Oh, my God, why?

08:08.856 --> 08:10.733
To impress girls, obviously.

08:10.816 --> 08:11.984
<i>Forrest Gump.</i>

08:12.067 --> 08:14.862
[gasps] Okay, uh, Paramount.

08:14.945 --> 08:17.614
- Mmm. <i>Se7en.</i>
- New Line.

08:17.698 --> 08:20.283
- Um, <i>Fast and the Furious.</i>
- Universal.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.744
- <i>First Wives Club.</i>
- Paramount.

08:21.827 --> 08:23.328
- <i>Silence of the Lambs.</i>
- Orion.

08:23.412 --> 08:25.247
- <i>La Dolce Vita.</i>
- [inhales sharply]

08:25.330 --> 08:27.290
Did you say, <i>"Cocktail"?</i>
Is that what I heard?

08:27.374 --> 08:29.084
<i>"Cocktail"?</i> Touchstone.

08:30.293 --> 08:31.712
- Still impressive.
- Thank you.

08:31.795 --> 08:35.215
Plus, I feel like I just got a window
into the life of 14-year-old Gus.

08:35.298 --> 08:36.299
Yikes!

08:39.010 --> 08:40.136
Gus Cru-shek?

08:41.011 --> 08:42.806
- Oh, right here.
- Hey.

08:43.306 --> 08:45.851
- Are you not gonna correct her?
- That's close enough.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.687
[boy] I don't wanna go to swim class.

08:49.771 --> 08:51.499
[man] You have to go.
We already paid for it.

08:51.523 --> 08:55.402
Cost 300 bucks for that whole package.
That's $50 for each one.

08:55.485 --> 08:57.338
- [woman] Why don't you want to go...
- Makes sense.

08:57.362 --> 09:00.407
That is such a classic,
passive-aggressive dad move.

09:00.490 --> 09:03.535
That reminds me of my dad when
we'd go out in public and he'd yell at us.

09:03.618 --> 09:06.830
- You know, just restrained and angry.
- Really?

09:06.914 --> 09:09.958
Yeah. I mean, usually it was
about how, like... [inhales deeply]

09:10.042 --> 09:11.682
we shouldn't get dessert
at the restaurant

09:11.752 --> 09:14.379
because we have plenty of ice cream
at home, sort of thing.

09:14.462 --> 09:16.089
- Yeah.
- But still, very mad.

09:16.173 --> 09:18.008
We always ordered dessert, no question.

09:18.091 --> 09:22.137
Oh, really? You guys were a real, uh,
Richie Rich family, huh?

09:22.220 --> 09:24.932
We were kind of rich
when my dad was still employed.

09:25.015 --> 09:27.642
Hmm. Yeah, we were strictly
middle class, baby!

09:27.725 --> 09:28.936
[both chuckle]

09:29.019 --> 09:32.314
But if we had lived in a big city,
you know, like, LA or New York,

09:32.397 --> 09:34.817
we would've been totally dirt poor.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.026
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.986
Especially with four kids, so...

09:38.070 --> 09:40.613
- Did you have siblings?
- Just one. My brother Bob.

09:40.697 --> 09:42.866
- Bobby Dobby.
- Bobby Dobb.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.786
And, uh, what's, uh... [sighs]
What's Bobby Dobby do now?

09:45.869 --> 09:50.665
Lives in Tucson.
He's got two kids, Lilian and...

09:51.959 --> 09:53.751
Fuck, I can never remember the boy's name.

09:53.836 --> 09:54.962
- Your nephew?
- [gasps]

09:55.045 --> 09:56.815
- You don't remember your nephew's name?
- Oh, okay.

09:56.839 --> 09:58.519
In my defense, he's, like,
three years old,

09:58.548 --> 10:00.550
so he hasn't made that big
of an impression on me.

10:00.634 --> 10:03.512
And the last time I saw him, he told me
that my head looked like a butt.

10:03.595 --> 10:04.930
[both chuckle softly]

10:05.555 --> 10:07.933
What about you?
Older or younger, your siblings?

10:08.016 --> 10:09.976
Oh, both. [inhales sharply]

10:10.060 --> 10:14.147
I have an older brother, uh, Ken,
who's the perfect kid.

10:14.231 --> 10:16.274
- Wait. You're not the perfect child?
- No.

10:16.358 --> 10:17.818
- What?
- Uh, yeah, he, like...

10:17.901 --> 10:22.280
He still lives in my hometown, Brookings,
with his family, so my parents love him.

10:22.364 --> 10:23.531
I mean, that makes sense.

10:23.615 --> 10:26.994
And then, I have a...
a younger sister, Caroline,

10:27.077 --> 10:28.661
and she's the closest to me in age

10:28.745 --> 10:31.248
and we get along all the time.
She's awesome.

10:31.331 --> 10:36.378
Then I have a youngest sibling.
He's my brother, Andrew...

10:36.461 --> 10:37.587
Whatever. He's a dick.

10:37.670 --> 10:38.964
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:39.047 --> 10:41.842
He's just, like, moody,
and when we were growing up,

10:41.925 --> 10:47.305
he would, like, smoke pot,
and break curfew and... get away with it,

10:47.389 --> 10:49.141
which drove me insane.

10:49.224 --> 10:50.475
Andrew's my hero.

10:50.558 --> 10:54.562
I... I love Andrew. It's just typical
sibling rivalry bullshit.

10:55.939 --> 10:57.690
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

10:57.774 --> 10:58.816
No. I got this.

10:58.900 --> 11:00.819
- You don't have to do that.
- No, no, no.

11:00.903 --> 11:01.987
I'm happy to, really.

11:02.070 --> 11:05.782
I'm gonna be honest, I was kinda doing
the slow motion move for my wallet.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.409
- Yeah, I noticed.
- [laughs]

11:07.492 --> 11:10.745
You were moving pretty slow there.
It was like you were buffering.

11:10.829 --> 11:12.390
- [laughs] I got you next time.
- [chuckling]

11:12.414 --> 11:13.540
Okay. Yeah.

11:14.749 --> 11:16.584
So, um...

11:16.668 --> 11:19.254
[clicks tongue] what are you doin' now?

11:19.337 --> 11:22.465
You wanna keep hangin' out?
You sick of me? Or...

11:22.549 --> 11:25.177
- I'm not getting sick of you.
- Well, I'm not sick of you.

11:27.012 --> 11:30.432
You wanna... go to a movie or something?
There's a theater down the street.

11:30.515 --> 11:31.724
Yeah.

11:37.105 --> 11:40.233
- So, what's your go-to snack?
- Hmm. Good question.

11:40.317 --> 11:42.319
Maybe a... Kit Kat.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.779
Oh, my God.
Okay, pretend you're talking.

11:44.862 --> 11:48.616
Okay, uh... blah, blah, blah.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.618
We're pretending, we're pretending.

11:50.702 --> 11:52.079
Who are we trying to avoid?

11:52.162 --> 11:55.332
Oh, God. My ex. He's over there.

11:55.415 --> 11:58.251
- I cannot deal with him.
- Wait, the guy in the white shirt?

11:58.335 --> 11:59.502
Don't look at him. Stop.

11:59.586 --> 12:02.589
Hey, buddy, want a little popcorn
with that butter?

12:02.672 --> 12:03.840
Geez Louise.

12:04.507 --> 12:06.384
He's putting on a lot of butter.
You can't see.

12:06.468 --> 12:09.304
Okay, he is going...

12:09.387 --> 12:11.598
He is gone.

12:11.681 --> 12:13.391
- Oh, thank God.
- So, uh...

12:13.475 --> 12:16.144
How did you meet, uh...
What's his name?

12:16.228 --> 12:17.437
- Dustin.
- Dustin.

12:17.520 --> 12:19.064
He used to manage my friend's band.

12:19.648 --> 12:22.025
- That's cool.
- Yeah, I thought so, too.

12:22.109 --> 12:25.445
Turns out, it's only cool-adjacent,
which suits him perfectly.

12:25.528 --> 12:26.779
Mmm.

12:39.834 --> 12:41.128
[sighs]

12:41.211 --> 12:43.046
Were you crying during the movie?

12:43.713 --> 12:45.340
- No.
- Yes, you were.

12:45.423 --> 12:47.467
- Mmm... What?
- [laughing]

12:47.550 --> 12:49.094
Come on, gimme a break.

12:49.177 --> 12:52.430
Father-son stuff always
really gets to me. So...

12:52.514 --> 12:54.266
But he was a terrible father.

12:54.349 --> 12:57.269
He didn't start caring about his son
until he followed in his footsteps

12:57.352 --> 12:58.728
and became a bounty hunter.

12:58.811 --> 13:01.689
No, he wanted to be a good father,
he just couldn't be.

13:01.773 --> 13:04.026
- That's, like, why I was so sad.
- Mmm.

13:04.109 --> 13:06.236
You know what makes me cry during movies?

13:06.319 --> 13:09.406
When a character faces death
with dignity.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.491
That's some real <i>Terms of Endearment</i> shit.

13:11.574 --> 13:13.993
- Oh, yeah, exactly.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

13:14.077 --> 13:16.704
- Hey, it's okay that you cried.
- Thank you.

13:16.788 --> 13:18.040
It could also be the shrooms.

13:18.123 --> 13:21.709
'Cause sometimes people are emotional
the day after they take them.

13:21.793 --> 13:24.087
I appreciate how much
you're trying to help me,

13:24.170 --> 13:25.880
but I would've cried regardless.
[chuckles]

13:25.963 --> 13:27.090
Okay. [chuckles]

13:27.174 --> 13:29.801
Um, I'm gonna pee.

13:29.884 --> 13:32.345
- Do you mind holding this for me?
- Sure.

13:32.429 --> 13:34.181
- I don't wanna pee all over it.
- No.

13:34.264 --> 13:36.558
- All right. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

13:53.700 --> 13:54.700
Mickey.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.036
Oh. Jesus. Hi.

13:57.120 --> 14:00.165
- Oh, sorry. Did I scare you?
- Uh, yeah.

14:01.249 --> 14:04.794
I'm glad I ran into you.
I've actually been wanting to apologize

14:04.877 --> 14:06.064
for what I said at Shaun's party.

14:06.088 --> 14:07.089
Okay.

14:07.172 --> 14:09.525
They were tenting my place for termites.
It was a nightmare.

14:09.549 --> 14:14.304
And then I saw you that night
and you were an easy target...

14:15.180 --> 14:17.390
Anyway, I'm...
I'm sorry I called you a, uh...

14:17.474 --> 14:20.435
- Whore?
- Whore. Yes.

14:21.186 --> 14:23.938
I'm very sorry. [clears throat]
That's not who I am.

14:24.021 --> 14:27.859
I mean, it's who I was
in that moment...

14:27.942 --> 14:29.527
but I shouldn't have said that.

14:30.320 --> 14:33.198
Thank you.
I... I appreciate that.

14:35.742 --> 14:37.660
[smacks lips] So...

14:37.744 --> 14:38.953
here alone?

14:39.036 --> 14:40.455
Uh, yeah, you?

14:40.538 --> 14:41.873
No. With a guy.

14:41.956 --> 14:43.791
Oh. A boyfriend?

14:43.875 --> 14:46.253
No, just a guy I see movies with.

14:46.336 --> 14:47.962
Mmm, mysterious.

14:48.045 --> 14:49.506
How's the dog?

14:49.589 --> 14:52.134
- You mean our dog?
- Uh, no, no, no, no. It's your dog.

14:52.217 --> 14:54.261
I clearly remember
giving up parental rights.

14:54.344 --> 14:56.554
[laughs] Um, he is good.

14:56.638 --> 14:58.782
I just took him downtown
for the blessing of the animals.

14:58.806 --> 15:00.566
- You wanna see a picture?
- Yeah, of course.

15:01.768 --> 15:04.354
- [Mickey] Oh, my God. Look at Buster.
- [chuckles]

15:04.437 --> 15:06.856
He is so cute and so old.

15:06.939 --> 15:08.650
- Yeah, look at this.
- [sighs]

15:08.733 --> 15:11.194
[softly] Oh, my God.
His whole snout's gray now.

15:11.278 --> 15:14.114
- [chuckles]
- Has it really been that long?

15:14.197 --> 15:15.698
Oh, my God.

15:15.782 --> 15:18.618
- Hey.
- Oh, hi. Um... [smacks lips]

15:18.701 --> 15:21.121
- Dustin, this is Gus.
- Hello.

15:21.204 --> 15:23.206
- Hey.
- Gus, this is Dustin.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.917
- And that is his dog Buster.
- Yeah.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.044
Ah, look at that cutie. [chuckles]

15:28.128 --> 15:30.004
He takes after you.
He's got your eyes.

15:30.087 --> 15:31.423
- [laughs] Yeah.
- [Gus chuckles]

15:32.465 --> 15:34.384
What are you kids doing today?

15:34.467 --> 15:35.468
I don't know.

15:35.552 --> 15:38.180
I guess, we're just kinda
playing it by ear.

15:38.263 --> 15:40.848
- Making it up as we go along. Yeah.
- Nothing wrong with that.

15:40.932 --> 15:42.350
How's your Sunday going?

15:42.434 --> 15:44.936
Uh, it's fine. I actually...

15:45.019 --> 15:47.063
I gotta run, 'cause I do have plans.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.357
- Okay, cool.
- Nice to see you.

15:50.525 --> 15:53.069
- Have a nice day, kids.
- Yeah. Yeah, you too.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.529
Nice to meet ya.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.784
Hey, I know I'm not supposed to like him,
but I kinda do.

16:00.452 --> 16:04.331
Well, he was a huge asshole to me
the last time I saw him, but...

16:04.414 --> 16:06.291
Oh, should I have been meaner to him?

16:06.374 --> 16:08.710
Do you want me to online bully him
or anything, or...

16:08.793 --> 16:09.836
[laughing]

16:09.919 --> 16:11.463
No, no, he...

16:11.546 --> 16:14.424
actually, just apologized to me,
weirdly.

16:14.507 --> 16:15.758
- I was...
- Oh?

16:15.842 --> 16:18.136
- kind of impressed.
- About what?

16:18.886 --> 16:23.600
He was, uh, freaking out at me
and accusing me of cheating on him,

16:23.683 --> 16:26.519
which I kind of did.

16:27.979 --> 16:29.146
Okay.

16:29.231 --> 16:30.523
But we were basically broken up.

16:30.607 --> 16:32.442
And he was always out of town,

16:32.525 --> 16:36.488
and I would never do
anything like that anymore

16:36.571 --> 16:41.034
because that's not who I am now,
with SLAA, and you're nothing like...

16:43.035 --> 16:45.580
Whatever. You know what?
I'm... I'm happy that I did it.

16:45.663 --> 16:49.626
Because if I was with Dustin now,
then I wouldn't be here with you.

16:51.919 --> 16:53.213
That's sweet.

16:55.548 --> 16:56.924
Here we go.

16:57.008 --> 16:58.260
[car lock beeps]

17:00.470 --> 17:01.513
[sighs] All right.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.433
[scoffs] Okay, I gotta ask.

17:05.517 --> 17:08.603
Why do you always have a beach towel
in your backseat?

17:08.685 --> 17:11.439
Uh... I don't know.

17:11.522 --> 17:14.317
It's kind of a aspirational thing, like...

17:14.401 --> 17:17.862
I hope that one day I can go to the beach
and use that towel.

17:17.944 --> 17:19.696
So you've never actually used it?

17:19.781 --> 17:21.449
No. I mean, I've...

17:21.991 --> 17:25.537
put it on wet grass at the park,
but it's never touched sand.

17:25.619 --> 17:28.079
- Let's go right now.
- To the beach?

17:28.164 --> 17:29.541
Yeah. Why not?

17:30.124 --> 17:31.125
Okay.

17:31.208 --> 17:33.336
Let's give this towel
the best day of its life.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.297
All right. Let's do it. Let's road trip.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.292
I gotta admit. This is pretty nice.

18:54.376 --> 18:55.543
[Gus] Yeah.

18:55.627 --> 18:57.712
[Mickey] It's the best day I've had
in a long time.

18:58.755 --> 19:00.131
Yeah, me too.

19:02.174 --> 19:05.845
It's funny though, when something
like this is, like, going really well...

19:05.928 --> 19:08.305
I get, like, super nervous, like,

19:08.390 --> 19:12.309
"Oh, when is something bad gonna happen
and it's all gonna end?"

19:12.394 --> 19:13.728
- Ya know?
- Yeah. Me too.

19:13.811 --> 19:15.062
[sighs]

19:17.314 --> 19:19.984
What's the worst thing you've ever done?

19:21.486 --> 19:23.613
[sighs heavily] Seriously?

19:24.531 --> 19:26.032
We're gonna find it out eventually,

19:26.115 --> 19:27.492
may as well get it over with.

19:28.159 --> 19:30.161
All right, that makes sense. Yeah.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.121
You go first.

19:32.705 --> 19:35.249
Um, let me think. Okay, uh...

19:35.332 --> 19:38.212
If you can't think of it right away,
you've never done anything that bad.

19:38.252 --> 19:40.046
No, I'm just stalling,

19:40.129 --> 19:42.065
trying to come up with a way
not to tell you this.

19:42.089 --> 19:43.215
You can't.

19:44.175 --> 19:45.885
Okay. Um...

19:45.968 --> 19:47.387
[exhales sharply]

19:47.470 --> 19:49.431
When I was in college,

19:49.514 --> 19:52.559
I went to this party
and I got, like, super wasted,

19:52.642 --> 19:54.727
and then everybody started daring me to...

19:56.228 --> 19:58.523
- take a shit in my hand.
- Mmm-hmm.

19:58.606 --> 20:00.483
And, um... I did.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.902
- I... I took a shit in my hand.
- Okay.

20:02.985 --> 20:04.571
And then I, like...

20:04.654 --> 20:06.656
walked around the party
for, like, an hour,

20:06.739 --> 20:08.658
just, like, carrying this turd in my hand

20:08.741 --> 20:11.786
and introducing it to people, like,

20:11.869 --> 20:14.497
"Hey, meet my friend Doody Garland."

20:14.581 --> 20:17.542
Yeah, I can't play this game with you.
You're an amateur.

20:18.543 --> 20:20.753
You can't do that. That's cheating.

20:20.837 --> 20:23.255
Just tell me your fifth-worst thing.

20:25.132 --> 20:26.468
[Gus] Okay.

20:26.551 --> 20:28.260
All right. Let's go.

20:28.344 --> 20:30.597
- No, thank you, sir.
- What?

20:31.388 --> 20:33.725
- You have to.
- No! Are you kidding me?

20:33.808 --> 20:36.102
It's super polluted, and it's really cold.

20:36.185 --> 20:38.062
My mom sent me
this whole article about

20:38.145 --> 20:40.397
how all the city's run-off ends up
in the ocean.

20:40.482 --> 20:41.566
It's a health hazard.

20:41.649 --> 20:44.986
We came all this way
to be at the beach.

20:45.069 --> 20:47.822
You don't just climb up to the tower
and not ring that bell.

20:47.905 --> 20:49.216
Let's get in there.
Let's get in the water.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.993
This is being at the beach.
I'm on the towel. I'm good.

20:52.076 --> 20:54.704
No, being at the beach
is getting into the ocean.

20:54.787 --> 20:57.081
What if we go in there,
we get a disease and die?

20:57.164 --> 21:01.002
Come on, there's billions and trillions
of gallons of water in there.

21:01.085 --> 21:02.419
If you get E. coli...

21:03.588 --> 21:04.672
I'll buy you ice cream.

21:04.756 --> 21:07.509
I'm not dressed for it!
This isn't a beach outfit!

21:07.592 --> 21:09.093
Okay. Tell the towel.

21:09.176 --> 21:11.471
You tell the towel
that we came all this way

21:11.554 --> 21:15.266
just to sit in sand
and not go into the water.

21:15.349 --> 21:16.476
- Come on.
- All right.

21:16.559 --> 21:19.270
- But I'm only putting my toe in.
- Toes, that's fine.

21:19.353 --> 21:20.623
