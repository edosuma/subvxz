00:33.825 --> 00:34.909
Who is it?

00:34.992 --> 00:36.578
New York Bulletin.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.289
I don't need a subscription.

02:30.608 --> 02:31.609
Come on.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.921
Let's talk about Lewis Wilson.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.214
You offered him a job. That right?

04:19.591 --> 04:21.052
Not the job he wanted.

04:23.638 --> 04:26.557
He came to me looking
to get into contracting work. I said no.

04:27.141 --> 04:29.561
I didn't think he could handle it.
Mentally.

04:31.062 --> 04:34.190
So I offered to find him something else.
As a favor.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.942
Because you had a relationship?

04:36.609 --> 04:38.945
Favor wasn't for Wilson.
I didn't even know the kid.

04:39.028 --> 04:40.028
Mmm.

04:40.321 --> 04:41.531
Check our records.

04:41.948 --> 04:45.910
You'll see we very clearly evaluated him
as unfit during the hiring process.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.955
I'd say I made the right call,
wouldn't you?

04:49.038 --> 04:52.292
That same unfit kid
breached your security.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.712
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

04:56.754 --> 04:58.172
And I'll find out how soon enough.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.882
Maybe I can help you with that.

05:00.925 --> 05:04.345
Homicide picked up a dead body.
One of yours. Isaac Lange?

05:05.137 --> 05:06.764
Shot dead in his apartment.

05:07.640 --> 05:13.187
I guess Wilson just turned up,
took his shit, easy as that, and then...

05:13.270 --> 05:14.939
Sergeant, Senator Ori is alive.

05:15.022 --> 05:18.818
I just lost four guys,
and you're implying... what?

05:19.777 --> 05:20.778
Negligence?

05:20.862 --> 05:22.702
Wouldn't be the first time
an outfit like yours

05:22.780 --> 05:25.450
got paid for a job
it wasn't qualified to handle.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.077
'Cause you guys...

05:29.245 --> 05:31.581
NYPD, you're blameless, right?

05:32.081 --> 05:35.042
I mean, you guys never get shit wrong.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.422
You ever serve, Sergeant?

05:39.839 --> 05:40.965
I wear a shield...

05:41.883 --> 05:42.883
every day.

05:44.469 --> 05:47.430
Well, in the military,
we expect to lose people.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.809
Our goal is to achieve the mission.
My mission was to keep Ori alive.

05:51.976 --> 05:52.976
He's alive.

05:54.103 --> 05:57.273
Two experienced,
well-armed professional soldiers

05:57.356 --> 05:59.651
pulled off a surprise attack
and it failed.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.404
Far as I'm concerned, this...

06:04.238 --> 06:05.407
this is a win.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.118
You gotta admit, though,
I mean, the coincidence is huge, right?

06:09.536 --> 06:12.914
Wilson was known to you,
and you served with Castle for years...

06:12.997 --> 06:15.417
You wanna arrest me for something,
go ahead.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.377
Otherwise, we're done here.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.504
I got families to call.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.342
Why don't you talk to the senator?

06:24.676 --> 06:25.885
Ask him what happened.

06:25.968 --> 06:28.137
- I intend to.
- Good for you.

06:28.220 --> 06:30.306
When is the last time
you talked with Frank Castle?

06:34.185 --> 06:35.311
The last time?

06:38.105 --> 06:39.398
Couple years now.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.652
Up until yesterday, I thought he was dead.

06:43.235 --> 06:45.488
This look like the work
of a dead man to you?

06:58.793 --> 07:01.420
No, I wanna do the interview downstairs,
somewhere visible.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.464
Let people know I'm not intimidated.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.175
If you weren't intimidated, sir,
I wouldn't be here.

07:06.258 --> 07:08.010
By the way, you should be.
Makes you smart.

07:08.094 --> 07:11.264
- It doesn't project the right image.
- I'm not here to protect your image.

07:11.347 --> 07:13.641
I'm here to keep you
from getting your ass shot off.

07:14.726 --> 07:15.727
Excuse me.

07:22.650 --> 07:23.651
Russo.

07:23.735 --> 07:24.819
Can you talk?

07:27.154 --> 07:30.282
Uh... yeah. Yeah, hang on.

07:35.204 --> 07:36.831
Heard you got a new client, huh?

07:36.914 --> 07:38.374
Business must be good.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.658
If I believed everything I read,
that's all down to you.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.171
Wouldn't put too much faith in that.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.591
Hope you're calling
because you're reconsidering my offer.

07:46.674 --> 07:47.675
Still stands.

07:47.759 --> 07:51.554
There's a lot of heat on you, brother.
We gotta get you out of this city.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.515
12 hours, I can have you anywhere
you wanna be.

07:54.306 --> 07:57.351
Lewis Wilson, he's coming after Ori.

07:57.434 --> 07:59.687
He's got no intentions
of letting him make that speech.

08:01.689 --> 08:02.773
Okay.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.194
And how would you know
about something like that?

08:05.776 --> 08:06.776
Told me as much.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.071
What is it with you and this kid?

08:09.697 --> 08:11.741
We have unfinished business.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.620
Yeah, well, we know
how you feel about that.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.664
Kid's got delusions of grandeur.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.957
You gotta get the senator out of there,
but tell no one.

08:20.541 --> 08:23.628
Make sure you keep the appearance
that he's still in that hotel suite.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.880
You set the trap, I'll spring it.

08:27.423 --> 08:28.550
You're here.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.928
Frank, this is my work. I can't just...

08:34.847 --> 08:37.725
Listen, tell me where you are.

08:38.392 --> 08:40.562
Meet me. We can do this together.

08:40.645 --> 08:44.524
Look, you just keep your team
out of my way.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.129
Miss Page. Billy Russo, Anvil.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.422
- Hi. Hmm.
- Pleasure.

09:08.505 --> 09:10.842
I appreciate you doing this.

09:11.801 --> 09:15.597
I know it isn't easy, but if you walk me
through the scene, the, uh...

09:16.472 --> 09:18.515
the details, they tend to be clearer.

09:19.308 --> 09:21.435
Yeah, whatever helps most.

09:25.815 --> 09:26.899
Looking at this...

09:28.526 --> 09:30.903
it's a wonder any of us survived.

09:34.490 --> 09:37.577
Those men died saving my life.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.581
Hell of a thing to know, Detective.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.585
All this, uh...

09:46.543 --> 09:48.545
kind of thing, it's new to me.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.800
I'd never even held a gun
before today.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.596
Seeing that kind of violence...

09:58.430 --> 09:59.891
up close, being...

10:01.392 --> 10:02.392
part of it...

10:04.854 --> 10:06.606
makes you reassess...

10:07.940 --> 10:10.234
think on what kind of man you are.

10:14.321 --> 10:16.073
Have you ever been shot at?

10:17.074 --> 10:18.868
Yes, I have.

10:19.660 --> 10:20.828
How did it feel?

10:21.203 --> 10:22.872
At the time, uh...

10:24.206 --> 10:26.208
like it was happening to someone else.

10:27.001 --> 10:29.420
Afterwards, that's... It's different.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.716
Seemed so fast.

10:35.467 --> 10:36.552
And now...

10:37.804 --> 10:41.390
now it... it plays like slow motion...

10:43.225 --> 10:44.225
in my head.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.021
The regulations I'm pushing for

10:47.104 --> 10:49.523
aren't about taking certain guns away
from all people.

10:49.606 --> 10:52.694
They're about taking all guns away
from certain people.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.361
And you really think that's possible?

10:54.445 --> 10:55.445
I have to, Karen.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.555
Karen! We...
Move! We have to move!

11:33.901 --> 11:35.111
I'll get help!

11:50.835 --> 11:52.044
That's what he said?

11:52.920 --> 11:55.423
Ori told you that he went for help? Wow.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.761
Well, that is total,
unadulterated bullshit.

12:00.469 --> 12:02.304
Straighten me out, then, Karen.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.932
Tell it like you saw it
while it's fresh in your mind.

12:06.308 --> 12:09.228
And before I have a chance
to, uh, call the office?

12:09.854 --> 12:11.355
What's more important, huh?

12:11.647 --> 12:12.940
Catching the guys who did this,

12:13.023 --> 12:14.316
or your exclusive?

12:15.317 --> 12:16.610
First time I hear your story,

12:16.693 --> 12:19.196
I don't wanna be reading about it
on the front page.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.574
Well, the story
that you're subscribing to...

12:22.199 --> 12:25.369
that Castle and Wilson worked together,
is a complete fiction.

12:25.452 --> 12:28.790
So why does all the evidence says
Wilson came up one stairwell

12:28.873 --> 12:32.251
and Castle came up the other
at the exact same time?

12:32.334 --> 12:35.629
A classic pincer movement
with this room right in the middle.

12:35.712 --> 12:38.192
Jesus, Brett, you worked
the Castle case the first time around,

12:38.257 --> 12:39.257
you know the guy.

12:39.758 --> 12:41.969
I am not saying
that the stuff that he does is right,

12:42.053 --> 12:44.221
but bombing innocent civilians?

12:44.972 --> 12:47.099
Come on, we both know better than that.

12:49.310 --> 12:53.439
It's funny how you and Castle keep, uh...
bumping up together.

12:55.649 --> 12:59.278
Okay. All right, in your opinion,
why was he even here?

13:02.406 --> 13:04.116
I think he was looking out for me.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.912
Frank Castle's not a terrorist.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.709
Even your own paper says different.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.216
Look, I was in this room...

13:20.799 --> 13:22.844
and I am telling you,
if it were not for Castle,

13:22.927 --> 13:25.346
the senator's brains would be splattered
all over this place.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.139
Not what he told me.

13:28.933 --> 13:34.730
Ori is a craven political animal who would
say anything to improve his Q-rating.

13:35.356 --> 13:38.317
Believe me,
the truth does him no favors.

13:41.778 --> 13:45.199
Shooting a senator
over a political opinion...

13:46.909 --> 13:49.328
does that really sound
like Frank Castle to you?

13:50.204 --> 13:54.291
Castle is crazy.
You tell me why crazy does anything.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.552
Miss Page. Billy Russo, Anvil.

14:05.636 --> 14:06.762
- Hi.
- Pleasure.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.307
Anti-gun senator being interviewed

14:10.391 --> 14:12.852
by a journalist
with a concealed carry permit.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.187
Life is full of little ironies.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.313
You checked me out.

14:16.397 --> 14:17.957
I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't.

14:17.982 --> 14:21.068
I am expecting
my weapon back when this is done.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.155
Well, you can never be too careful,
Miss Page.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.615
I'll make sure you get it back
as soon as you're downstairs.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.200
Please.

14:30.536 --> 14:33.664
Anti-gun senator choosing
a military contractor for his security?

14:34.831 --> 14:37.001
That's another of life's little ironies,
isn't it?

14:37.084 --> 14:38.961
Can't wait to hear what he has to say.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.922
Hopefully he'll say
that if you want the best,

14:41.005 --> 14:43.257
Anvil is the only choice.

14:43.340 --> 14:46.343
And if he doesn't,
you can quote me on that.

14:46.843 --> 14:50.389
I bet I can. So where'd you get
your sales smarts? Wharton?

14:50.973 --> 14:52.016
Afghanistan.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.435
Wharton was my safety school.

15:32.848 --> 15:36.102
Five will get you ten, the senator's using
taxpayer money for all of this.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.728
Am I right?

15:45.152 --> 15:47.821
Can I ask, how did it feel...

15:48.447 --> 15:51.533
on the radio,
when Lewis Wilson threatened your life?

15:51.617 --> 15:53.035
Both our lives?

15:53.119 --> 15:54.453
Not good.

15:54.536 --> 15:58.082
But that's another degree of living
in this city, especially as a woman.

16:06.548 --> 16:10.427
No, look, honestly, I... I can appreciate
what you're doing here, but...

16:11.095 --> 16:14.181
rhetoric and real lives,
those things are worlds apart.

16:14.265 --> 16:15.349
They don't have to be.

16:15.432 --> 16:18.519
Oh, says the man who in an hour
will be downstairs with New York liberals

16:18.602 --> 16:21.230
who paid $10,000 a plate
to support his campaign.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.524
Uh, to be clear, not my campaign.

16:23.607 --> 16:27.111
The funds raised are for the families
of the victims of the bombings.

16:29.029 --> 16:29.863
Fair enough.

16:29.946 --> 16:32.074
Money that would not need to be made

16:32.158 --> 16:34.994
if there weren't victims
of this senseless violence.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.997
Sure, but a gun is just a tool,
isn't it, Senator?

16:38.080 --> 16:39.956
That can't be the only place
the problem lies.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.625
Couldn't agree more.

16:41.708 --> 16:44.378
But you can't give
a six-year-old a chainsaw.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.261
Hey, he told me to come relieve you.

17:17.118 --> 17:19.371
Karen, the numbers bear it out.

17:19.454 --> 17:23.125
The great majority of Americans agree
on expanding background checks

17:23.209 --> 17:24.710
for all gun sales.

17:24.792 --> 17:26.962
Let's not blame the tool.
Let's manage the owners.

17:44.605 --> 17:45.939
You're a gun owner, right?

17:46.648 --> 17:49.610
Yes. Fully licensed and known to the NYPD.

17:49.693 --> 17:50.819
Can I ask why?

17:51.653 --> 17:52.738
Personal safety.

17:52.821 --> 17:54.448
Society should provide that.

18:17.804 --> 18:20.974
Look, the regulations I'm pushing

18:21.057 --> 18:23.394
aren't about taking certain guns away
from all people.

18:23.477 --> 18:26.688
They're about taking all guns away
from certain people.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.372
And do you really think that's possible?

18:28.440 --> 18:29.440
I have to, Karen.

18:48.001 --> 18:50.629
No, no.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.674
No, no, no. No.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.967
No. No, please, no. No, no, no, no, no.

18:56.593 --> 18:58.804
Oh, God.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.447
- Please, don't kill me.
- Shit!

19:00.472 --> 19:02.098
Please! Please, don't kill me!

19:02.183 --> 19:05.269
Please! Please, don't kill me!
Killing me won't get what you want.

19:05.352 --> 19:07.146
Don't shoot him. Please, don't shoot him.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.939
Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him, please.

19:09.022 --> 19:11.150
- Please, don't shoot him.
- No, no, no!

19:15.279 --> 19:17.573
Come on! Come on!

19:24.788 --> 19:26.248
Hey...

19:28.124 --> 19:30.836
I got a bomb! I got a bomb!

19:31.503 --> 19:32.879
It's a dead man's switch, Frank.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.047
Lewis...

19:34.130 --> 19:35.275
Drop it!

19:38.427 --> 19:39.511
Drop it.

19:45.809 --> 19:47.186
You don't need her, kid.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.326
Just let her go.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.745
Stay back. You want her dead?

20:04.828 --> 20:06.497
Drop your weapons!

20:06.580 --> 20:08.582
Get back! Everybody, get back!

20:08.665 --> 20:11.377
I will blow us all to hell!
Back! Get back!

20:11.460 --> 20:13.962
- He's wired! Stand down!
- Everybody, back!

20:14.045 --> 20:15.756
Everybody hold fire.
He's got a bomb.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.929
I let this go, everybody dies!

20:23.555 --> 20:25.557
Put your guns down!

20:27.351 --> 20:30.061
Your hands up!

20:30.812 --> 20:33.232
Get your hands up. Hands up!

20:34.525 --> 20:35.651
Get 'em up!

20:41.490 --> 20:42.741
I will come for you.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.888
Shit, look at the state of this place.

21:05.806 --> 21:08.433
Pretty amazing, huh?
That anyone got out of here alive.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.018
Given who was in here firing.

21:10.394 --> 21:14.523
- You're being sarcastic.
- Call it a dose of healthy skepticism.

21:14.606 --> 21:15.607
About what?

21:16.232 --> 21:20.362
I think if Frank Castle came in here
to kill those people, they'd be dead.

21:20.445 --> 21:21.488
Then why was he even here?

21:22.281 --> 21:24.700
Well, that's the million dollar question,
right?

21:25.701 --> 21:26.993
The reason I'm still here.

21:27.077 --> 21:30.038
You're still here
because I haven't told you you can leave.

21:30.122 --> 21:33.333
No, the way I hear it, you were
on administrative leave until today.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.085
Now, why would that be?

21:37.921 --> 21:39.548
Someone killed my partner.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.094
I'm sorry.

21:46.805 --> 21:47.806
Were you there?

21:49.516 --> 21:50.601
Yeah, I was.

21:51.768 --> 21:53.437
Can't imagine what that was like.

21:57.983 --> 22:01.152
Look, work with me here, okay?

22:01.236 --> 22:03.876
Your first day back, and you're
on the scene of a terrorist attack?

22:03.905 --> 22:05.366
Telling me there's no thread there?

22:07.033 --> 22:08.619
What do you think happened here?

22:08.702 --> 22:11.538
Well, the evidence says Wilson
and Castle came to kill the senator.

22:11.622 --> 22:12.623
The evidence?

22:13.374 --> 22:17.336
You know, I checked you out, too.
You worked Castle the first time around.

22:18.670 --> 22:21.423
I think you're having trouble
with the narrative, Sergeant.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.176
Why don't we start
with what you were doing here?

22:25.886 --> 22:27.262
I came to talk to a guy.

22:39.900 --> 22:40.901
She's back?

22:59.711 --> 23:00.712
You think...

23:01.672 --> 23:05.926
Castle being alive vindicates
everything going on here?

23:06.009 --> 23:08.804
Men died. Nothing vindicates that.

23:14.100 --> 23:17.563
But if people had listened to me,
then maybe they'd still be alive.

23:17.646 --> 23:20.231
You walked those men
into that warehouse, no one else.

23:20.315 --> 23:22.776
You filed false tactical plans.

23:22.859 --> 23:25.571
What were you hiding, Dinah?
And from whom?

23:30.576 --> 23:32.744
I knew Frank Castle was alive.
I'd known for a while.

23:32.828 --> 23:35.038
He stole the weapons shipment
from the Greeks.

23:35.121 --> 23:36.414
Why didn't you tell me this?

23:36.498 --> 23:38.017
'Cause Castle's connected to Kandahar,

23:38.041 --> 23:40.252
and every lead I found
kept turning up dead.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.337
And then I found a bug in my office.

23:44.005 --> 23:45.006
Show's over.

23:54.599 --> 23:57.185
That's pretty much how I looked
when I found it, too.

23:58.562 --> 24:02.023
Stein and I put on a little radio play
for whoever was listening.

24:03.024 --> 24:04.818
We pretended we had a lead on Castle,

24:04.901 --> 24:07.237
and waited to see
who turned up to kill him.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.615
And it never entered your head
to report it?

24:09.698 --> 24:11.992
Yeah. Just like with Zubair and the video.

24:12.075 --> 24:14.578
We sent that up the chain of command,
and look what happened.

24:15.662 --> 24:18.099
We didn't know who else at Homeland
might have been compromised.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.708
You could have come to me.

24:21.042 --> 24:24.755
- God damn you, Dinah.
- This goes deep, Rafi.

24:25.338 --> 24:28.175
CIA, NSA, us. Maybe even DOD.

24:28.258 --> 24:30.552
I mean, the guys who killed my team
were for real.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.053
They went through us like a knife.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.598
For what? What do you have?

24:35.348 --> 24:37.768
Half the city is trying to kill Castle.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.686
Your witness, if you can find him...

24:40.228 --> 24:43.356
is a crazed terrorist
intent on bombing this city.

24:44.357 --> 24:46.943
Is this all you have to show
for this insanity?

24:47.903 --> 24:50.071
I've got another witness and a name.

24:50.947 --> 24:54.075
The CIA agent who killed Zubair.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.495
William Rawlins.

25:00.498 --> 25:02.000
Are you serious?

25:02.083 --> 25:04.628
He's the director of Covert Operations.

25:04.711 --> 25:06.504
He's a murdering piece of shit.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.097
The dead suspects from your little sting.

25:17.015 --> 25:19.851
All ex-Special Forces. Mercenaries.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.325
You're gonna need this.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.615
- Hey.
- You're back at work.

26:14.698 --> 26:18.409
- Yeah.
- And that's a good thing?

26:18.493 --> 26:20.036
Well, time will tell.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.538
Well, you know I think so.
It's... I think it's great.

26:23.456 --> 26:26.167
It's good to see you.
I didn't wanna not see you,

26:26.251 --> 26:30.922
but I'm kinda busy.
I got this senator to protect, so...

26:31.006 --> 26:33.091
Well, you wanted more work on home soil.

26:33.174 --> 26:36.720
Well, wars can't last forever,
right? At least, we hope not.

26:37.304 --> 26:38.930
Yeah, it's actually why I'm here.

26:39.430 --> 26:43.518
Talk to you about some of your men,
the work they do on home soil.

26:52.653 --> 26:54.487
These are the men who killed my team.

26:55.822 --> 26:56.822
Okay.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.034
They all worked for you.

27:02.078 --> 27:04.580
- Yeah.
- Shit, I'm sorry.

27:09.002 --> 27:10.920
That's it? That's all you have to say?

27:11.630 --> 27:13.006
They worked for you.

27:13.589 --> 27:16.092
Yeah. Yeah, way back,

27:16.176 --> 27:18.887
and for about 20 other places, too,
probably foreign and domestic.

27:18.970 --> 27:22.140
These kind of operators, they'll work
under any flag for the right price.

27:22.223 --> 27:24.600
Four out of four is some coincidence.

27:26.019 --> 27:27.645
Yeah, listen, it's...

27:27.729 --> 27:30.231
it's not like these guys
are on my Christmas card list, okay?

27:30.315 --> 27:32.358
The guys who work for me,
they come and go.

27:32.442 --> 27:33.711
It's the nature of the business.

27:33.735 --> 27:36.446
And, yeah,
sometimes they take gigs across the line.

27:36.529 --> 27:39.157
Governments we don't like
and criminal shit.

27:39.240 --> 27:42.410
And if I find out about it,
then they don't get hired back.

27:49.625 --> 27:53.296
What were your guys doing, anyway...
to cross their path?

27:55.673 --> 27:56.674
What?

27:58.218 --> 28:01.262
You think that I had anything
to do with this?

28:01.346 --> 28:02.472
Fifth guy got away.

28:04.099 --> 28:07.728
The one who killed Stein.
Do you have any idea who that might be?

28:12.315 --> 28:15.151
I can ask around for you.
See... see who they ran with.

28:15.861 --> 28:19.823
I... I wanna talk to you about this more,
but I really... I really gotta go.

28:21.491 --> 28:24.953
- How about I come by tonight?
- Oh, it's... it's not a good idea.

28:25.912 --> 28:30.583
Jesus. If you're trying to make me feel
like the bad guy here, congratulations.

28:34.212 --> 28:37.465
If the papers are right, you're guarding
the senator from your old buddy.

28:39.926 --> 28:41.427
You ready to put Castle down?

28:43.346 --> 28:46.558
- If I have to, yeah.
- Castle's a terrorist. You believe that?

28:48.727 --> 28:52.522
I think that if you beat a dog
long enough, it goes crazy.

28:52.605 --> 28:54.941
Doesn't matter how good it was before.
After that happens,

28:55.025 --> 28:57.485
the dog that you knew
is never coming back.

28:58.444 --> 29:02.323
Trust me when I tell you that
if Frank doesn't come after my guy today,

29:02.407 --> 29:04.367
nobody will be more relieved than me.

29:06.953 --> 29:10.040
That's the nature of the lives we chose,
I guess.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.043
Make tough decisions.

29:14.210 --> 29:15.503
Live or die by it.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.718
- Eagle One, Eagle Two, 10-45.
- Eagle Two, clear.

29:23.719 --> 29:26.514
- Eagle One, copy.
- Everything okay?

29:26.597 --> 29:27.598
I gotta go.

29:33.980 --> 29:35.624
Available units report to Eagle One.

29:35.648 --> 29:37.650
- We may have a situation.
- Copy that.

30:04.094 --> 30:05.220
Stairwell A, clear.

30:28.076 --> 30:29.828
Hurry up! Let's go!

30:39.963 --> 30:43.049
Castle, drop the weapon!

30:45.510 --> 30:47.512
This isn't on me, Madani. None of it.

30:47.595 --> 30:50.265
I believe you. Now drop your weapon.

30:51.516 --> 30:54.978
That's not gonna happen.
You're just gonna have to let this go.

30:55.896 --> 30:58.064
No. No, I'm not gonna let this go.

30:59.524 --> 31:03.611
You're gonna stand up in court
and tell the world about Cerberus,

31:03.694 --> 31:07.282
Rawlins, everything.
We want the same people, Frank.

31:09.325 --> 31:10.660
We want the same thing.

31:10.743 --> 31:13.872
You've been talking
to somebody I know, huh?

31:22.713 --> 31:23.714
Okay.

31:29.095 --> 31:31.139
You're gonna kneel
and put your hands on your head.

31:31.222 --> 31:34.184
You're gonna shoot me, shoot me. Yeah?

31:34.976 --> 31:36.686
I'm gonna walk down those steps.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.356
You do what you gotta do.

31:52.077 --> 31:54.787
- What the hell are you doing? Stand down!
- He was gonna shoot you!

31:54.870 --> 31:57.123
This is my prisoner, Russo!

32:01.002 --> 32:04.214
Stand down,
or I'll charge you with obstruction.

32:10.095 --> 32:12.055
Why are you still pointing that gun at me?

32:12.138 --> 32:14.182
I am trying to save your life!

32:14.265 --> 32:15.266
Bill?

32:15.766 --> 32:20.355
I'm a federal agent,
ordering you to drop the weapon!

32:22.941 --> 32:24.525
No need for you to get hurt.

32:29.239 --> 32:30.490
This dies with him.

32:34.285 --> 32:35.745
Castle, stay back.

32:41.001 --> 32:42.335
It was war, Dinah.

32:43.669 --> 32:45.671
And the only crime in a war is to lose.

32:45.755 --> 32:47.090
What'd you do?

32:54.514 --> 32:55.556
Walk away.

32:57.058 --> 32:58.393
Downstairs now!

32:59.019 --> 33:00.520
Go! Go! Go!

33:00.603 --> 33:02.188
You killed Stein.

33:03.523 --> 33:05.763
Let's move!

33:06.442 --> 33:08.712
- Put your hands up!
- Get down on the ground!

33:08.736 --> 33:11.947
- Right now! Get down!
- Drop that weapon right now!

33:12.032 --> 33:14.117
Show me your goddamn hands!

33:14.200 --> 33:15.285
On the ground!

33:15.368 --> 33:17.078
I'm Homeland...

33:18.329 --> 33:20.040
You're gonna wish you shot me!

33:21.374 --> 33:22.958
Down on the ground!

33:24.085 --> 33:25.128
Don't move, asshole!

33:31.676 --> 33:33.386
You wanna tell me why you and Russo

33:33.469 --> 33:35.555
were pointing guns at each other
instead of Castle?

33:36.931 --> 33:39.059
- Difference of opinion.
- Your weapon had been fired.

33:39.142 --> 33:41.394
- I had to stop Castle.
- And so had Russo's.

33:41.477 --> 33:42.871
Yeah. He probably told you the same thing.

33:42.895 --> 33:45.981
No, the officers said they saw
an armed standoff between you and Russo.

33:46.066 --> 33:48.651
I had the situation under control,

33:48.734 --> 33:51.654
yet Russo seemed intent
on putting a bullet in my prisoner.

33:51.737 --> 33:56.242
Well, I can understand his point of view.
Castle just killed a bunch of Russo's men.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.662
Do you have any actual proof
of that, Detective?

33:59.745 --> 34:01.747
Ballistics? Witnesses?

34:02.748 --> 34:05.626
How many people say Castle
actually killed anyone today?

34:06.878 --> 34:08.963
Why are you so certain he's innocent, huh?

34:09.380 --> 34:11.466
Come on. Help me see it.

34:11.549 --> 34:14.719
You want me to see this big picture here,
then paint it for me.

34:15.636 --> 34:18.514
I don't think you believe
Castle's a terrorist any more than I do.

34:19.514 --> 34:21.391
Question is, Detective Mahoney...

34:22.143 --> 34:24.853
is anyone willing to give him
the chance to prove that...

34:25.271 --> 34:26.731
before they shoot him down?

34:31.860 --> 34:33.362
I didn't say you can leave.

34:35.322 --> 34:36.532
But I'm going to anyway.

34:46.667 --> 34:49.129
- Can I borrow her?
- Detective wants to talk to her.

34:49.212 --> 34:51.045
- She under arrest?
- No.

34:51.130 --> 34:53.591
Then Miss Page will be with you
when she's ready.

34:56.219 --> 34:58.054
I might have to get one of those.

35:00.473 --> 35:02.850
God, what a day.

35:02.933 --> 35:04.810
There have been better.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.193
You and I once had a conversation
about trust, Karen.

35:13.278 --> 35:16.864
"The story beneath the story."
You remember that?

35:17.573 --> 35:18.573
Vividly.

35:21.119 --> 35:25.123
You knew Frank Castle was alive that day.
You didn't tell me.

35:26.207 --> 35:27.959
I thought that's what you did to me.

35:34.257 --> 35:37.635
Look, there are a lot of people
that want Frank dead.

35:37.718 --> 35:40.513
Powerful people who will use
what happened here as an excuse

35:40.596 --> 35:42.765
to hunt him down and kill him.

35:43.266 --> 35:45.268
- I don't want that to happen.
- Who?

35:46.602 --> 35:48.813
Agent, if you know who,
then do something about it.

35:48.896 --> 35:50.565
It's not that easy.

35:51.482 --> 35:52.692
I need Frank.

35:54.652 --> 35:57.238
You two have a connection. I know that.

35:58.364 --> 36:02.243
If you know where he is,
or how to contact him, please.

36:02.327 --> 36:04.287
I'm the best chance he's got.

36:14.422 --> 36:16.131
He's not who they say he is.

36:18.384 --> 36:19.385
Saved my life.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.429
Again.

36:21.512 --> 36:24.056
Well, that's something else
we have in common.

36:26.226 --> 36:27.393
Now, get some rest.

36:32.773 --> 36:34.493
Hey! Hey! I got a bomb!

36:34.525 --> 36:36.235
I got a bomb!

36:38.279 --> 36:40.199
- Hey! Don't you come any closer!
- No.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.699
- No, he has bomb.
- Easy.

36:41.782 --> 36:43.326
He has a bomb! Stop!

36:43.409 --> 36:45.286
Listen to her!
Shoot me, this goes off!

36:45.370 --> 36:48.414
Hey! Hey, I don't give a shit!
This will go off!

36:48.498 --> 36:50.458
Stay the line.

37:23.408 --> 37:24.409
Lewis...

37:26.244 --> 37:29.330
Lewis, what... what's the plan?
What do we do now, huh?

37:29.414 --> 37:31.874
"Wait like a soldier
Wait, wait like a soldier"

37:31.957 --> 37:34.252
- I'm really scared here, okay?
- "Wait, wait..."

37:34.335 --> 37:35.878
We can get out of this if we're smart.

37:35.961 --> 37:38.756
- "Wait, wait like a soldier"
- I bet there are cops all over here.

37:38.839 --> 37:40.258
I'm not gonna give myself up.

37:40.341 --> 37:42.510
I am not gonna go to jail.
I need to goddamn think!

37:42.593 --> 37:44.345
- Nobody else here has to die.
- Shut up!

37:44.429 --> 37:45.429
Okay.

37:55.022 --> 37:58.901
"Remember it is ruin to run from a fight

38:01.779 --> 38:04.407
So take open order,
lie down, and sit tight

38:05.074 --> 38:08.578
And wait for support like a soldier

38:09.287 --> 38:12.957
Wait, wait, wait like a soldier"

38:16.336 --> 38:17.337
Hmm.

38:18.921 --> 38:20.506
Sergeant used to drill us.

38:23.258 --> 38:26.846
I learned it till I heard it in my sleep,
running through my head.

38:28.597 --> 38:30.933
In a fire fight,
it's the only thing I could think of.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.026
It's over, Lewis, you don't...

38:42.695 --> 38:45.406
- You don't have to hurt anyone else.
- I sent you letters.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.908
You could've been part of the solution.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.035
But you chose to be part of the problem.

38:50.119 --> 38:53.038
I thought that you were different.

38:53.122 --> 38:56.459
I thought that you had...
that you understood.

38:56.542 --> 39:00.338
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Help me, okay?
Help me... Help me understand.

39:01.672 --> 39:04.884
All right? And then we'll go. We'll...
we'll tell everyone else, okay? Just...

39:06.218 --> 39:07.470
I can't do that if we're dead.

39:09.096 --> 39:11.015
As long as I have you...

39:12.725 --> 39:14.769
and I have this bomb...

39:16.521 --> 39:18.230
- I'm gonna be okay.
- You don't need it.

39:18.313 --> 39:21.066
You don't need the...

39:21.150 --> 39:23.903
Hey! Anyone tries to get in here,
I swear this bomb goes off!

39:23.986 --> 39:25.446
Wilson!

39:25.530 --> 39:26.739
- I'm unarmed.
- Hey!

39:26.822 --> 39:27.883
- Okay.
- I'm unarmed.

39:27.907 --> 39:30.993
Stay back! You take one more step,
I swear to Christ this is going off!

39:32.202 --> 39:34.414
Whole world thinks
we did this together, kid.

39:38.793 --> 39:41.504
Hey! Hey! Stay back.

39:46.175 --> 39:48.093
You know, kid, maybe you were right.

39:48.928 --> 39:50.846
Maybe you and me, we are the same.

39:53.182 --> 39:54.934
Maybe this is the way
it's supposed to end.

39:55.017 --> 39:59.021
Just... just you and me, though, right?
Just you and me, and a bomb.

40:00.189 --> 40:02.525
Come on, kid, let's do it, okay?
Let's do it!

40:05.653 --> 40:09.156
When we were with Curtis,
you told me to pull that white wire.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.158
You did the right thing, kid.

40:13.828 --> 40:15.162
You could do it again.

40:16.789 --> 40:17.790
Let her go.

40:18.833 --> 40:20.918
- You do that...
- Hey! Hey! You stay back!

40:21.001 --> 40:22.587
- Get back!
- God damn it, kid!

40:22.670 --> 40:24.439
Didn't your father teach you
not to hurt a woman?

40:24.463 --> 40:26.465
My father had nothing to do with this.

40:27.216 --> 40:30.136
The second that bomb went off,
you made him part of this.

40:31.554 --> 40:33.639
One day, not long from now,
he's gonna wake up,

40:33.723 --> 40:35.975
he's... he's gonna walk outside,

40:36.058 --> 40:38.894
and the word "terrorist"
is gonna be painted on his car.

40:38.978 --> 40:42.356
His mailbox is gonna be so full of hate
and death threats,

40:42.440 --> 40:43.858
he's just gonna give up.

40:43.941 --> 40:46.861
His friends, his family,
they're not gonna come around.

40:46.944 --> 40:49.614
His phone won't ring.
He will know loneliness, Lewis.

40:49.905 --> 40:51.031
He will suffer!

40:51.115 --> 40:53.033
Just...

40:53.993 --> 40:57.162
Your old man, his life... it's ruined.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.083
I know what that's like.

41:02.126 --> 41:03.836
You and me, we are the same.

41:03.919 --> 41:06.964
We try to pretend that there's
something more, something noble.

41:07.548 --> 41:09.258
Brothers-in-arms, right?

41:09.675 --> 41:13.220
We try to create a version of the world
that we can stand to live in.

41:13.513 --> 41:16.056
We're creatures of habit, Lewis. Right?

41:16.140 --> 41:19.101
We like to do the same thing
over and over and over again.

41:23.856 --> 41:26.776
It's just like women
and their goddamn bags, right?

41:26.859 --> 41:28.068
I mean, look at her.

41:29.069 --> 41:32.698
After everything she's been through,
she's still got that bag around her neck.

41:33.532 --> 41:37.244
Miss Page, I imagine you could tell me
everything you have in that bag, right?

41:38.370 --> 41:39.370
Yep.

41:42.041 --> 41:44.293
Lewis, you're a creature of habit
if I've ever seen one.

41:46.086 --> 41:48.422
Do it now, Karen! Do it now!

42:04.564 --> 42:08.818
"When you're wounded
and left on Afghanistan's plains

42:09.401 --> 42:13.656
And the women come out
to cut up what remains

42:15.991 --> 42:19.537
Just roll to your rifle..."

42:20.495 --> 42:24.166
"...and blow out your brains"

42:25.793 --> 42:28.503
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Frank, we gotta go. We gotta go now!

42:28.588 --> 42:30.339
- Karen, get out of here.
- Frank?

42:30.422 --> 42:32.592
- Karen, you go! Go now!
- Hell, no! Come on!

42:32.675 --> 42:34.635
"An' go to your God"

42:34.719 --> 42:36.303
That's it, kid. You can do it.

42:36.386 --> 42:38.097
"Like a soldier

42:39.098 --> 42:43.268
Go, go, go like a soldier"

43:15.843 --> 43:17.011
Are you okay?

43:17.720 --> 43:18.721
Uh-huh.

43:24.059 --> 43:25.853
Shit.

43:30.691 --> 43:31.692
Come on.

43:32.860 --> 43:35.529
Hey!

43:46.832 --> 43:48.685
- East stairwell.
- Copy that.

43:48.709 --> 43:49.877
Don't shoot!

43:51.003 --> 43:53.255
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
- Hold your fire!

43:54.298 --> 43:55.800
Stand down. Everybody, stand down.

44:01.931 --> 44:03.057
Let her go, Castle.

44:06.393 --> 44:07.853
There's no way out of this.

44:07.936 --> 44:10.096
Got the building surrounded.

44:23.243 --> 44:24.286
God damn it!

44:26.789 --> 44:28.999
I need a man on every floor!
Move! Move! Move!

44:51.563 --> 44:53.273
Okay.

45:06.704 --> 45:08.664
Frank. Frank...

45:33.981 --> 45:35.565
Go. Go on.

45:46.076 --> 45:47.077
Take care.

46:05.470 --> 46:08.974
So, um, after Wilson blew himself up,

46:09.058 --> 46:12.311
Castle, who, according to you,
is the hero of this whole thing,

46:12.394 --> 46:14.188
took you hostage with your gun?

46:14.897 --> 46:17.858
- Technically, it's not my gun.
- And then he gave you the gun back?

46:17.942 --> 46:19.609
Doesn't sound like a terrorist, does he?

46:21.946 --> 46:24.406
I think you and I both know
he saved lives here today.

46:25.240 --> 46:26.533
You helped Castle escape.

46:27.701 --> 46:29.203
I should arrest you for that.

46:30.871 --> 46:34.499
If Castle is a terrorist,
then I'm just a victim.

46:38.753 --> 46:40.714
You and I both know that's not the truth.

46:42.132 --> 46:43.300
Yes, we do.

46:46.053 --> 46:47.054
Where is he?

46:48.055 --> 46:50.891
Honestly... I don't know.

46:53.602 --> 46:55.322
Do you really think
Castle's the kind of guy

46:55.395 --> 46:58.523
who walks into a building
he doesn't know how to get out of?
