00:00.127 --> 00:02.108
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...

00:02.188 --> 00:02.997
What do you want?

00:03.003 --> 00:05.041
Sorry to commandeer
your vessel, Captain,

00:05.047 --> 00:06.614
but I'm afraid for what I have planned,

00:06.682 --> 00:08.449
you can't be in Storybrooke.

00:08.551 --> 00:09.617
Emma, are you there?

00:09.719 --> 00:12.453
Gideon... he sent me away.

00:12.555 --> 00:14.555
I would never leave you.

00:14.624 --> 00:15.956
What the hell do I have to do?

00:16.058 --> 00:17.691
Kill the Black Fairy.

00:17.793 --> 00:19.026
Did she harm you?

00:19.128 --> 00:20.628
She toughened me up.

00:20.730 --> 00:22.930
What did she do to you?

00:22.999 --> 00:24.498
Depends what you mean.

00:59.602 --> 01:01.902
I've brought someone new.

01:02.004 --> 01:03.637
Another child for the mines?

01:03.739 --> 01:05.706
No.

01:05.808 --> 01:08.676
Not this one.

01:08.778 --> 01:11.512
This child is different.

01:11.614 --> 01:14.815
He's... precious.

01:16.619 --> 01:18.485
I will care for him as
though he were my own.

01:18.587 --> 01:20.721
Care for him as if he were mine.

01:27.697 --> 01:30.931
Shh. Yes.

01:30.947 --> 01:33.830
_

01:33.836 --> 01:35.369
Oh, how sweet.

01:37.273 --> 01:40.441
A remnant of the past.

01:42.878 --> 01:46.213
You won't be needing this anymore...

01:46.315 --> 01:48.382
Gideon.

02:03.933 --> 02:06.300
You sent Hook away on the submarine?

02:06.402 --> 02:09.136
You took him away from me?

02:09.238 --> 02:10.904
And you'll get him back...

02:10.973 --> 02:13.407
as soon as we destroy
the Black Fairy together.

02:13.509 --> 02:15.042
Now you want my help?

02:15.177 --> 02:16.822
You have a funny way
of asking for a favor.

02:16.846 --> 02:18.090
I suspect, without a little nudging,

02:18.114 --> 02:19.257
I already know the answer, then.

02:19.281 --> 02:20.281
Answer's always the same.

02:20.349 --> 02:21.715
Then I suggest you reconsider,

02:21.817 --> 02:24.651
because given the protection
spell I placed over him,

02:24.754 --> 02:26.386
it's impossible for him to return.

02:26.489 --> 02:27.489
I'll find a way.

02:29.625 --> 02:32.059
I have your tear, remember, Savior?

02:32.161 --> 02:34.995
I'm the only one that
can bring him back.

02:39.168 --> 02:42.736
You tried to kill me with
that sword, and you failed,

02:42.838 --> 02:45.105
and now you think you can bully me?

02:45.207 --> 02:46.840
I will never help you.

02:46.942 --> 02:49.938
If you don't bring Hook back on
your own, I will make you do it.

02:57.186 --> 03:00.354
Do you really think you frighten me?

03:00.456 --> 03:03.657
Do you think anything frightens me?

03:03.759 --> 03:08.495
You have no idea what I've been through.

03:08.597 --> 03:11.832
I was raised by the Black Fairy.

03:11.934 --> 03:14.368
Do you know the depths
of depravity in her soul?

03:14.470 --> 03:16.603
If I don't stop her, no one will.

03:16.672 --> 03:19.206
Hundreds of people are
depending on me to save them...

03:19.308 --> 03:21.141
children that I swore to protect.

03:21.243 --> 03:26.046
So you... you think... you
think you're so righteous?

03:26.148 --> 03:27.548
You think I'm the bad guy?

03:27.650 --> 03:31.151
You are so far wrong, Savior.

03:31.253 --> 03:35.155
So, yes, you bested me.

03:35.224 --> 03:38.025
But now we have a common cause,
whether you know it or not,

03:38.127 --> 03:39.693
so I would think long and hard

03:39.795 --> 03:42.379
how badly you want to
see your captain again.

03:43.499 --> 03:46.233
I will not give up my mission...

03:46.335 --> 03:47.634
or my word.

03:53.706 --> 03:56.376
"Others before him had cowered in fear

03:56.445 --> 03:58.846
becoming trapped in its web.

03:58.948 --> 04:02.649
The hero Gideon knew
this, but he was undaunted.

04:02.751 --> 04:04.051
He fought valiantly

04:04.153 --> 04:07.688
until he slayed the Great
Spider from the Echoless Forest

04:07.790 --> 04:09.957
and led the villagers to safety."

04:13.562 --> 04:15.796
Put it away, please!
Put it away, Gideon!

04:15.865 --> 04:18.498
If she sees it, she'll know
that you stole it from her.

04:18.601 --> 04:20.000
Who knows what she'll do.

04:20.101 --> 04:21.468
It's okay, Roderick.

04:21.570 --> 04:22.970
I won't let her hurt you.

04:23.072 --> 04:26.306
As long as I'm around, you'll
be safe from the Black Fairy.

04:32.548 --> 04:35.482
Good night, my little darlings.

04:35.551 --> 04:39.653
Mother has come to
wish you sweet dreams.

04:39.688 --> 04:44.725
Gideon, I was going to tell
you a bedtime story tonight...

04:44.793 --> 04:46.994
a very special one.

04:50.065 --> 04:53.100
But I see you already have one.

04:55.938 --> 04:58.272
Did you really think I
wouldn't know what you stole?

04:58.374 --> 05:00.607
Give it back. It's mine.

05:00.709 --> 05:02.376
No, child.

05:02.444 --> 05:04.878
Everything here belongs to me.

05:04.914 --> 05:07.347
I've read the inscription.

05:07.449 --> 05:09.583
My real mother gave it to me...

05:09.685 --> 05:11.018
so I'd remember to be a hero.

05:12.054 --> 05:14.521
I'm your real mother.

05:14.590 --> 05:16.623
You're not my mother.

05:16.725 --> 05:18.392
And you never will be!

05:20.062 --> 05:22.329
You want to be a hero, do you?

05:22.398 --> 05:24.331
Just like your real mum?

05:24.433 --> 05:27.034
Well, here's the truth, Dearie.

05:27.102 --> 05:31.371
Just because she was a
hero doesn't make you one.

05:33.008 --> 05:36.610
And now I'm going to show
you exactly what you are.

05:46.155 --> 05:48.088
No! Help!

05:48.190 --> 05:49.790
Help! Help!

05:49.858 --> 05:50.924
Gideon, help!

05:51.026 --> 05:53.627
So, you want to be a hero?

05:55.097 --> 05:56.430
Show me.

05:58.300 --> 05:59.833
Help me!

05:59.902 --> 06:01.468
Help me, please!

06:01.503 --> 06:03.770
No! Gideon!

06:05.534 --> 06:07.474
Help me!

06:13.115 --> 06:16.616
Just as I thought... coward.

06:17.686 --> 06:19.553
You have much to learn...

06:19.655 --> 06:20.988
from me.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.326
Gideon! Help!

06:26.428 --> 06:27.527
No!

06:28.998 --> 06:30.297
Help!

06:30.399 --> 06:32.966
Please! Heeeeelp!

06:34.136 --> 06:35.892
Gold! Get out here... now.

06:35.898 --> 06:36.899
I've got questions,

06:36.905 --> 06:38.305
and you better have answers.

06:40.042 --> 06:41.174
Well, if you want answers,

06:41.180 --> 06:42.843
I suggest you start by asking nicely.

06:42.945 --> 06:43.844
I'm done with nice.

06:43.912 --> 06:45.078
Your son has a death wish,

06:45.084 --> 06:47.110
which, if he messes
with me one more time,

06:47.116 --> 06:48.081
I'm happy to fulfill.

06:48.087 --> 06:49.177
And I'm happy to help.

06:49.183 --> 06:51.551
We've been looking for some
mother/daughter bonding.

06:51.620 --> 06:52.620
What did he do now?

06:52.688 --> 06:54.554
He banished Hook to another realm.

06:54.656 --> 06:56.156
He's using him as a bargaining chip

06:56.225 --> 06:58.258
to force me to help him
to kill the Black Fairy.

06:58.293 --> 07:00.160
- He did?
- Yes, he did.

07:00.195 --> 07:01.995
Now, I know nothing about this Fairy,

07:02.064 --> 07:03.730
but I'm guessing you do.

07:03.799 --> 07:05.065
Yeah, she's my mother.

07:08.419 --> 07:11.271
She stole Gideon from the Blue Fairy,

07:11.340 --> 07:14.207
took him away to another realm
where time moves differently,

07:14.276 --> 07:17.044
tortured him for 28 years.

07:17.364 --> 07:19.546
Why would she do that?

07:19.552 --> 07:20.818
To hurt me.

07:20.983 --> 07:22.082
Her own son?

07:22.088 --> 07:24.288
That tells you all you
need to know about her.

07:24.420 --> 07:26.453
Emma, please don't hurt Gideon.

07:26.555 --> 07:29.956
He was not born evil.
No, she made him this way.

07:29.962 --> 07:32.662
If you help him, though, he
will be on the side of good.

07:32.780 --> 07:33.881
I-I'm certain.

07:33.887 --> 07:37.034
Belle, I can only go with
what I see and what I know.

07:37.132 --> 07:39.466
Then know this...
belief in good and hope

07:39.568 --> 07:42.269
isn't the only reason to spare my son

07:42.371 --> 07:43.970
and help destroy the Black Fairy.

07:44.039 --> 07:46.840
Right now we have an opportunity
to not only destroy her

07:46.875 --> 07:49.509
and save him, but to save all of us.

07:49.578 --> 07:51.044
She hasn't threatened anyone else.

07:51.113 --> 07:53.380
That's because she's in another realm...

07:53.449 --> 07:55.082
only able to break free long enough

07:55.150 --> 07:57.884
to steal other children
before it pulls her back in.

07:57.953 --> 07:59.653
But if she should break free for good...

07:59.755 --> 08:01.099
I think I can handle it. I handled you.

08:01.123 --> 08:02.867
I broke your curse...
the one you gave to Regina

08:02.891 --> 08:04.051
that started this whole mess.

08:04.126 --> 08:05.668
Well, that's just the
thing, Miss Swan...

08:05.674 --> 08:08.261
the curse, that dark curse.

08:08.363 --> 08:12.065
It and all of the
darkness you've ever faced,

08:12.167 --> 08:16.169
was borne out of one twisted soul...

08:16.271 --> 08:18.605
the Black Fairy.

08:18.707 --> 08:21.608
And unless we try and stop her,

08:21.710 --> 08:24.244
she is gonna bring far worse.

08:33.956 --> 08:35.688
How's it going, Mom?

08:35.791 --> 08:39.860
It's going... slowly.

08:39.962 --> 08:42.395
Casting a sleeping curse is
one thing, but breaking it?

08:44.894 --> 08:49.236
Apparently, Snow and Charming
have met their match... me.

08:49.304 --> 08:51.972
If there's anyone who can
undo your work, it's you.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.206
Yeah.

08:53.308 --> 08:56.309
I've cleaned up almost all
my evil half's messes...

08:56.411 --> 08:58.612
town line protection spell... check.

08:58.714 --> 09:01.681
I freed that dragon from
the mirror world... check.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.050
Got Doctor Dolittle out of that cage.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.287
Don't ask.

09:07.389 --> 09:09.389
I undid everything...

09:09.491 --> 09:12.025
except for the big one.

09:12.127 --> 09:13.994
I wish I could help.

09:14.096 --> 09:15.295
Maybe you can.

09:15.397 --> 09:17.264
There's a few ingredients in Emma's shed

09:17.366 --> 09:18.398
I haven't tried yet.

09:18.467 --> 09:19.987
Can you run over and grab them for me?

09:20.068 --> 09:22.335
Of course. What do you need?

09:22.437 --> 09:25.071
Uh... tongue of newt...

09:25.330 --> 09:27.396
Not the eye... tongue.

09:30.012 --> 09:31.044
Henry?

09:32.915 --> 09:33.947
Henry?

09:38.487 --> 09:39.653
Henry?!

09:47.344 --> 09:48.990
You wanted to see me, Mother?

09:49.130 --> 09:50.930
So prompt.

09:50.998 --> 09:52.698
What do you want from me?

09:52.767 --> 09:55.568
Do you know what day it is?

09:55.670 --> 09:57.002
Day?

09:57.038 --> 10:00.606
It's your birthday, Dearie!

10:00.708 --> 10:02.474
My birthday?

10:02.510 --> 10:04.176
Well, don't act so flummoxed.

10:04.278 --> 10:05.477
Everyone has one.

10:05.546 --> 10:06.679
I just... I didn't know.

10:06.747 --> 10:08.981
Surprise!

10:09.083 --> 10:12.384
I thought this year, your 28th...

10:13.821 --> 10:16.055
we should celebrate.

10:16.123 --> 10:21.760
After all, you've grown into
such a strong, loyal son.

10:21.829 --> 10:26.332
And your magic abilities
are already so strong.

10:26.400 --> 10:29.001
What a sorcerer you shall be.

10:29.036 --> 10:32.705
I am so proud.

10:32.773 --> 10:34.473
Thank you, Mother.

10:38.279 --> 10:40.546
The dust you requested.

10:40.615 --> 10:42.481
Lock it away in my vault, would you?

10:45.119 --> 10:46.119
What is it?

10:46.220 --> 10:47.753
The key to my vault.

10:47.855 --> 10:49.188
It's missing.

10:49.290 --> 10:50.189
What?

10:50.291 --> 10:51.557
Stolen.

10:52.927 --> 10:54.927
Who would do such a thing?

10:55.029 --> 10:57.596
Down to the mines, my son.

10:57.632 --> 11:01.767
Find out who is responsible
for this act of treason.

11:01.836 --> 11:06.472
And when you do, do
as I've taught you...

11:06.574 --> 11:08.173
make them pay.

11:08.958 --> 11:10.776
For your dear mum.

11:22.490 --> 11:25.224
When I first came to this town,
that clock didn't even move.

11:25.293 --> 11:26.826
Now look at it, ticking away,

11:26.832 --> 11:30.062
marking every magical
second since my arrival.

11:30.131 --> 11:31.730
Are you here for nostalgia,

11:31.799 --> 11:33.465
or do you want something from me?

11:33.567 --> 11:35.234
I saw your parents.

11:35.269 --> 11:37.436
Made me realize something...

11:37.505 --> 11:39.538
something I saw the last
time that we chatted.

11:41.809 --> 11:43.842
The look of someone who needs hope.

11:45.279 --> 11:46.923
Henry had it all those
years ago when he found me

11:46.947 --> 11:49.315
and told me I'm the Savior.

11:49.383 --> 11:50.949
Now you have it.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.421
Are you saying you will help
me to defeat the Black Fairy?

11:55.489 --> 11:57.156
First things first.

11:57.224 --> 11:59.144
You came here to kill me,
which... call me crazy,

11:59.193 --> 12:02.795
but that doesn't exactly inspire trust.

12:02.863 --> 12:05.397
So I need a sign of good faith.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.675
Mm. And why?

12:07.681 --> 12:10.302
It's not like I could defeat
you anyway, even with this sword.

12:10.371 --> 12:11.937
Then hand it over.

12:12.006 --> 12:14.573
And the spell to get Hook
back. That's what I want.

12:22.750 --> 12:23.750
All right.

12:26.387 --> 12:28.153
We have a deal.

12:30.558 --> 12:32.558
Okay, then.

12:32.626 --> 12:35.027
Since I'm sure we have work to do,

12:35.129 --> 12:37.396
let's get my pirate back.

12:51.679 --> 12:53.412
Sorry.

12:53.514 --> 12:55.481
Didn't mean to interrupt.

12:55.549 --> 12:58.384
Actually, yes, I did.

12:58.452 --> 13:01.253
Look what the tide brought in.

13:01.288 --> 13:03.021
Captain Hook.

13:03.124 --> 13:04.356
Evening, Blackbeard.

13:04.425 --> 13:06.024
By the sand on your britches,

13:06.093 --> 13:08.927
I'd say someone's been
passed out on the beach again.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.529
It's part of a long journey home.

13:10.598 --> 13:12.898
A journey that's now
interrupting my game.

13:12.933 --> 13:16.235
Judging by your dwindling chips,
I'd say I've done you a favor.

13:16.303 --> 13:20.072
If you want a favor in
return, I'd be happy to oblige.

13:20.141 --> 13:24.576
Well, as luck would have
it, I do need a favor...

13:24.678 --> 13:26.879
a magic bean, to be exact.

13:26.981 --> 13:28.147
You got one for me before,

13:28.249 --> 13:30.026
and I'm willing to bet
that you have another one.

13:30.050 --> 13:33.018
And in return, that
sorry lot of cheap jewelry

13:33.087 --> 13:35.120
you probably stole from some wench?

13:36.557 --> 13:39.158
I assure you, those are
some of the finest jewels

13:39.226 --> 13:40.392
Agrabah has to offer.

13:40.461 --> 13:41.693
Agrabah?

13:41.796 --> 13:44.663
Sailing the high seas in a desert?

13:44.732 --> 13:47.332
Oh, you really have sunk to a new low.

13:48.969 --> 13:51.904
If the jewels aren't
enough, I do have...

13:52.006 --> 13:54.339
one more thing I could offer.

13:54.442 --> 13:55.674
Oh, and what's that?

13:55.776 --> 13:56.975
Well, I hear tell

13:57.044 --> 13:59.511
that you haven't had a
vessel for some time...

13:59.580 --> 14:02.448
not since you lost the
Jolly Roger in Arendelle.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.516
I've been meaning to
talk to you about that.

14:04.618 --> 14:06.229
Well, it's a good thing
I'm here, then, isn't it?

14:06.253 --> 14:08.120
Because what's a pirate without a ship?

14:08.189 --> 14:10.522
Are you trying to antagonize me?

14:10.624 --> 14:11.490
Yes, I am.

14:11.592 --> 14:12.658
Oh, good.

14:12.726 --> 14:14.626
Then you do wish to duel.

14:14.662 --> 14:18.297
I wish to do something... better.

14:18.365 --> 14:20.999
Something a bit more civilized.

14:21.068 --> 14:24.303
How about a hand of cards...

14:24.371 --> 14:26.205
for the Jolly Roger?

14:26.273 --> 14:29.241
You're willing to risk
your ship on a game?

14:29.310 --> 14:31.410
Well, it's only a risk if I lose.

14:40.754 --> 14:42.454
Have a seat.

14:49.296 --> 14:50.796
The Sorcerer's mansion?

14:50.898 --> 14:52.397
Well, what are we doing here?

14:52.466 --> 14:55.767
It's at the nexus of the most
powerful magic in Storybrooke.

14:55.870 --> 14:57.803
I think you know what's inside there...

14:57.905 --> 15:00.105
or rather, what we can
create inside there.

15:00.207 --> 15:02.274
A portal?

15:02.409 --> 15:03.569
But those take extreme magic.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.055
They don't just come out of thin air.

15:05.079 --> 15:07.179
It's not like hailing a cab.

15:07.248 --> 15:08.981
Luckily, you have me, then.

15:15.720 --> 15:16.885
Wow. Impressive.

15:16.891 --> 15:18.166
So, what next?

15:18.172 --> 15:19.658
Hook just walks in?

15:19.693 --> 15:22.261
Next, you must arrange the ingredients.

15:30.771 --> 15:32.271
Now the tear.

15:33.407 --> 15:36.174
This is about you... your love, Emma.

15:51.625 --> 15:52.891
I didn't start it.

15:52.993 --> 15:54.059
No.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.661
She figured out what we're doing.

15:59.700 --> 16:00.799
What the hell is that?!

16:00.901 --> 16:03.435
That... is a message.

16:13.147 --> 16:14.346
Gideon!

16:14.448 --> 16:16.381
Run!

16:29.989 --> 16:31.455
Attention.

16:31.557 --> 16:32.823
Gather 'round.

16:34.733 --> 16:35.733
Now!

16:40.917 --> 16:44.785
My mother has been quite
generous to each of you.

16:44.854 --> 16:48.255
And now one of you has betrayed her

16:48.357 --> 16:51.392
and stolen something from her...

16:51.494 --> 16:52.860
a key.

16:54.564 --> 16:57.898
Return it now, and you'll face
only my wrath, and not hers.

17:00.384 --> 17:01.483
No one?

17:03.239 --> 17:05.071
Then I have no choice.

17:05.141 --> 17:09.042
With just a bit of magic,
I can turn you vermin into...

17:09.145 --> 17:12.146
well... vermin.

17:12.214 --> 17:14.248
I didn't take it! It wasn't me! Please!

17:14.317 --> 17:15.928
Innocent or not, you're
about to be something

17:15.952 --> 17:18.685
far more important... an example.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.689
Wait, wait, wait!

17:22.758 --> 17:24.191
It was me.

17:24.260 --> 17:25.325
It was me.

17:29.365 --> 17:31.231
Well, then, little bug,

17:31.300 --> 17:33.567
it's time you learned your lesson, then.

17:33.636 --> 17:35.436
You don't remember me, do you?

17:37.139 --> 17:40.107
"And the hero Gideon fought valiantly

17:40.176 --> 17:43.944
until he slayed the Great
Spider from the Echoless forest."

17:47.116 --> 17:48.248
Roderick?

17:50.386 --> 17:51.685
I thought you were dead.

17:51.754 --> 17:53.053
Turns out I'm not.

17:53.122 --> 17:56.290
This must ease some
of that guilt for you,

17:56.358 --> 17:58.238
learning I didn't die by
the Black Fairy's hands

17:58.294 --> 17:59.893
all those years ago.

18:01.197 --> 18:04.465
You... you know I had no choice.

18:06.235 --> 18:08.635
Sounds like you've been telling
yourself that for some time.

18:10.239 --> 18:12.106
But you do have a choice now.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.226
Mother won't be happy if
I let the culprit go free.

18:16.295 --> 18:18.395
No, no, I know my old
friend is still in there

18:18.497 --> 18:19.563
deep down inside,

18:19.665 --> 18:21.464
and I know he wants to make it up to me.

18:24.136 --> 18:26.970
And how could I possibly do that?

18:27.039 --> 18:29.206
Be the hero you were meant to be.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.410
Help me defeat the Black Fairy.

18:49.161 --> 18:51.228
After we kill this thing, then what?

18:51.296 --> 18:53.029
Then we turn our sights to my mother.

18:53.098 --> 18:54.676
I thought she was
trapped in another realm.

18:54.700 --> 18:55.899
That's where you come in.

18:56.001 --> 18:57.067
You're the Savior.

18:57.169 --> 18:58.580
Your magic is the only
thing strong enough

18:58.604 --> 19:00.403
to not only slice into her realm,

19:00.505 --> 19:02.639
but to allow me to at last defeat her.

19:02.741 --> 19:04.619
So, you tried to kill me
because you didn't believe

19:04.643 --> 19:06.988
that I would help you get to
another realm to get back to her?

19:07.012 --> 19:09.679
Seemed like a... good plan at the time.

19:09.685 --> 19:11.014
In retrospect, perhaps not.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.238
I thought I could channel
your powers via the sword

19:13.244 --> 19:15.185
to open a portal between worlds.

19:17.756 --> 19:19.055
I'm sorry, Emma.

19:19.157 --> 19:20.790
After everything I've done to you,

19:20.892 --> 19:22.325
you should just walk away.

19:26.031 --> 19:27.031
Move!

19:33.872 --> 19:34.671
Deal.

19:34.773 --> 19:35.973
Still don't know when to quit?

19:36.008 --> 19:36.734
Deal!

19:36.740 --> 19:38.740
What's so important

19:38.844 --> 19:42.089
that you'd be willing to
trade your beloved ship

19:42.158 --> 19:45.392
for a magic bean... again?

19:45.461 --> 19:47.101
I've been separated
from the woman I love,

19:47.129 --> 19:48.762
and now she's in danger.

19:48.831 --> 19:50.631
Same woman as last time?

19:50.700 --> 19:51.700
Aye.

19:51.767 --> 19:53.278
Well, perhaps you
should have kept the ship

19:53.302 --> 19:55.069
and gotten rid of the woman.

19:55.137 --> 19:56.548
I don't remember asking your opinion.

19:56.572 --> 19:57.938
Well, be that as it may,

19:58.040 --> 20:00.674
in the future, you might
want to listen to me,

20:00.776 --> 20:02.676
because now...

20:02.778 --> 20:05.212
you won't have either.

20:07.617 --> 20:11.552
Time to pay up, old friend!

20:11.621 --> 20:12.853
Aye.

20:14.257 --> 20:15.289
Let's go, then.

20:15.391 --> 20:17.391
Aye. Let's.

20:23.766 --> 20:25.299
Where is it?!

20:25.401 --> 20:27.334
Oh! Right. Ooh.

20:27.340 --> 20:29.403
Did I forget to mention
there's just one problem?

20:29.472 --> 20:32.439
The Jolly Roger isn't
actually in this realm.

20:32.541 --> 20:34.408
It's... it's with that woman I spoke of.

20:34.477 --> 20:35.721
So if you want to claim your winnings,

20:35.745 --> 20:37.222
you're gonna have to give me
that bean and let me use it.

20:37.246 --> 20:38.145
You lied to me!

20:38.247 --> 20:39.607
And you had six aces in your deck!

20:39.649 --> 20:41.749
I'm not as drunk as
your other opponents.

20:47.256 --> 20:48.622
Well played.

20:49.759 --> 20:51.203
Don't worry. I'll be back in a flash.

20:51.227 --> 20:52.993
Oh, no, pirate.

20:54.797 --> 20:56.463
We're getting it together!

21:12.048 --> 21:13.147
What is this?

21:13.215 --> 21:14.281
You tell me.

21:14.350 --> 21:16.517
You wrote it... right
before you passed out.

21:16.619 --> 21:17.951
I...

21:18.054 --> 21:19.653
I have no idea.

21:19.755 --> 21:22.323
M-Maybe it's my Author powers?

21:22.425 --> 21:24.825
But I-I didn't use the pen,

21:24.927 --> 21:27.861
and I didn't write in the book.

21:27.963 --> 21:29.963
Mom, why did this happen?

21:30.066 --> 21:32.766
I-I... I don't really know.

21:34.804 --> 21:38.105
But, lucky for us, I
know someone who might.

21:41.077 --> 21:42.810
I don't think he's ever had visitors.

21:42.912 --> 21:44.411
Shocking.

21:45.915 --> 21:47.748
Do you really think
he'll be able to help us?

21:47.850 --> 21:49.917
I mean, he's not
exactly our biggest fan.

21:50.019 --> 21:51.518
Well, it's worth a shot.

21:51.620 --> 21:54.488
Henry, if your problem
is being the Author,

21:54.557 --> 21:56.724
why not ask the last one?

22:00.463 --> 22:02.062
Hello, Isaac.

22:05.101 --> 22:06.667
We need to talk.

22:15.376 --> 22:17.176
- Well?
- Shh, shh.

22:18.837 --> 22:21.338
I've heard of this
sort of thing happening,

22:21.406 --> 22:23.273
but it never happened to me.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.507
Not that I'm complaining.

22:24.576 --> 22:26.910
Well, actually, yes, I am complaining.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.778
You've had me locked
up for how long now,

22:28.814 --> 22:31.014
and what did I really do
to you that was so bad?

22:31.083 --> 22:33.083
Tried to kill us all.

22:33.151 --> 22:34.884
So, if you want to earn your way back,

22:34.920 --> 22:37.587
maybe you can start by
telling us what this means.

22:37.689 --> 22:39.255
Why did Henry write it?

22:39.324 --> 22:42.225
You're asking a lot of
questions, Your Majesty,

22:42.294 --> 22:47.197
but it's just so hard to
think in this dreary cell.

22:47.265 --> 22:49.466
A writer needs
motivation and inspiration

22:49.568 --> 22:50.900
in his surroundings.

22:51.002 --> 22:52.268
What do you want?

22:52.371 --> 22:54.137
I want out of here... for good.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.705
I'm gonna go back to New York.

22:55.807 --> 22:57.674
I'm gonna need a
car... something sporty.

22:57.743 --> 22:58.743
Ooh! Maybe a Porsche.

22:58.810 --> 22:59.976
You've got to be kidding me.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.277
Lamborghini will do.

23:01.346 --> 23:03.847
How about I drive the
sports car of your choice

23:03.915 --> 23:05.215
over your miserable little head

23:05.317 --> 23:07.550
until it squishes like a pumpkin?

23:09.955 --> 23:13.456
Freedom, sports car, Big Apple.

23:13.525 --> 23:15.959
And, since you're
making this so difficult,

23:15.994 --> 23:18.228
"Hamilton" tickets.

23:19.531 --> 23:21.531
Henry, grab your things.

23:22.868 --> 23:23.767
I was foolish to think

23:23.869 --> 23:25.635
this washed-up hack would help us.

23:26.705 --> 23:28.705
His Author powers are taking over.

23:33.178 --> 23:35.945
He thinks he controls
them, but he doesn't.

23:36.047 --> 23:38.748
They are more powerful than you know.

23:40.819 --> 23:42.619
Well, what's going to happen to him?

23:42.721 --> 23:43.820
Those trances...

23:43.922 --> 23:46.990
they'll become more
frequent, more intense.

23:47.058 --> 23:50.326
He might even end up in
a cell right next to me.

23:50.395 --> 23:51.795
Well, what can I do to help?

23:51.863 --> 23:54.831
You can start by giving me what I want.

24:08.513 --> 24:09.791
- What now?
- We got to get behind this thing

24:09.815 --> 24:11.548
so we can smash it back to Hell.

24:15.220 --> 24:16.252
Where are you taking me?

24:16.321 --> 24:18.054
Do you know how dangerous
it is to even hint

24:18.156 --> 24:19.460
at what you want to do to Mother?

24:19.466 --> 24:22.202
If my transgression protects
the ones I care about,

24:22.208 --> 24:23.629
then it's all worth it.

24:24.563 --> 24:25.929
Protects them from what?

24:26.536 --> 24:27.536
Haven't you ever wondered

24:27.566 --> 24:29.899
why the Black Fairy is
collecting all this dust?

24:32.337 --> 24:35.171
Years ago, the Black Fairy used her dust

24:35.273 --> 24:37.807
to create a most terrible spell.

24:37.876 --> 24:40.810
It was called the Dark Curse.

24:40.879 --> 24:41.911
The Dark Curse?

24:41.947 --> 24:43.413
She was obsessed with perfecting it

24:43.482 --> 24:45.148
and never stopped collecting the dust.

24:45.250 --> 24:47.016
And now...

24:47.085 --> 24:51.554
I-I don't want to find out
what else she's capable of.

24:54.459 --> 24:55.758
What happened...

24:57.929 --> 25:00.163
after...

25:02.834 --> 25:04.934
It's better left unsaid.

25:10.642 --> 25:11.774
I'm sorry.

25:14.779 --> 25:18.081
I regret it every day.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.316
I was weak.

25:20.385 --> 25:22.018
I could barely survive the mines.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.420
And what you endured...

25:24.489 --> 25:26.055
it would've...

25:27.926 --> 25:29.626
I'm sorry I was weak.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.830
We were children.

25:35.367 --> 25:38.968
But now we must stop
her before it's too late.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.340
What do you suggest we do?

25:44.409 --> 25:46.843
There's someone in another
realm who can help us...

25:46.945 --> 25:49.145
a brave hero called The Savior.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.281
We just need to reach her, Gideon.

25:51.383 --> 25:52.415
How?

25:52.484 --> 25:54.484
I've heard rumors of a crystal ball...

25:54.553 --> 25:57.153
a magical orb that would allow us

25:57.188 --> 25:59.222
to communicate across the realms.

26:01.593 --> 26:03.226
If you'll help me.

26:16.942 --> 26:18.708
Over here.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.150
It's a dead end.

26:33.258 --> 26:34.418
What the hell are you doing?!

26:36.161 --> 26:37.627
I already told you.

26:37.729 --> 26:40.063
Once you're dead, I'll be
able to channel your powers

26:40.165 --> 26:42.265
and use this sword to
open a portal to a realm.

26:42.367 --> 26:44.534
I was helping you.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.669
It's the only way.

26:46.738 --> 26:49.205
The spider... you brought it here.

26:49.274 --> 26:51.107
You knew you couldn't
kill me on your own.

26:51.176 --> 26:53.776
Alas, you were far
stronger than I anticipated.

26:55.614 --> 26:56.946
And while I created it,

26:57.048 --> 26:59.515
controlling it is a different matter.

26:59.584 --> 27:01.884
Which is why I must bid
you farewell now, Savior.

27:01.953 --> 27:03.653
What about Hook?!

27:03.722 --> 27:05.521
I'm afraid, no matter what he tries,

27:05.590 --> 27:08.591
returning to this realm
is impossible for him.

27:09.894 --> 27:12.061
I told you to walk away.

27:26.544 --> 27:27.844
What the devil...?

27:27.912 --> 27:30.580
So, where the hell is the Jolly Roger?

27:30.682 --> 27:33.116
The sooner we get this over
with, the sooner I can kill you.

27:33.184 --> 27:36.185
That's just it... this isn't my realm.

27:36.287 --> 27:37.854
What?!

27:37.956 --> 27:38.956
Then where are we?

27:39.057 --> 27:40.923
I'm not sure. Something
must have gone wrong.

27:41.026 --> 27:42.592
"Gone wrong"?

27:42.694 --> 27:43.694
"Gone wrong"?!

27:43.762 --> 27:45.828
Don't you know how to use a magic bean?

27:45.897 --> 27:48.931
You think of the place you
want to go, and it takes you.

27:49.034 --> 27:50.800
It's quite simple! I did!

27:50.869 --> 27:52.913
When we stepped through, I
thought about getting home to Emma,

27:52.937 --> 27:55.571
but this definitely isn't home.

27:55.640 --> 27:58.307
Whatever dark magic banished me
must have affected the portal,

27:58.376 --> 27:59.742
preventing me from returning.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.178
So now I'm the victim
of your banishment?

28:02.247 --> 28:04.280
So, where are we?!

28:06.284 --> 28:07.917
Wait.

28:08.019 --> 28:09.619
Do you hear that?

28:09.721 --> 28:11.554
What is that sound?

28:15.093 --> 28:16.826
I think I know what it is.

28:23.201 --> 28:25.201
Bloody hell.

28:25.303 --> 28:26.636
Who are they?

28:26.738 --> 28:28.905
Those are Lost Boys.

28:30.308 --> 28:32.308
Where are we?

28:32.410 --> 28:34.177
Neverland.

28:34.279 --> 28:35.511
Kill them!

28:57.711 --> 29:00.045
Where's a 40-foot can
of Raid when you need it?

29:07.120 --> 29:09.855
Okay, Charlotte, let's do this.

29:48.428 --> 29:49.961
It's time, Mother.

30:32.439 --> 30:34.205
Ms. Swan?

30:34.308 --> 30:35.407
Emma?

30:36.610 --> 30:37.610
Emma?!

30:46.186 --> 30:47.419
Are you all right?

30:47.521 --> 30:48.853
Yeah.

30:48.956 --> 30:50.789
I think so.

31:09.776 --> 31:11.843
Ms. Swan...

31:11.945 --> 31:13.311
where's Gideon?

31:15.015 --> 31:16.281
Did the beast kill him?

31:16.350 --> 31:18.149
That beast was his pet.

31:18.251 --> 31:19.951
He brought it here to kill me.

31:20.053 --> 31:24.389
I'm sorry, but your son cannot be saved.

31:24.491 --> 31:25.857
He's evil.

31:29.663 --> 31:32.897
This is where she keeps all of
her most powerful possessions.

31:32.966 --> 31:35.467
If the orb exists, it'll be in here.

31:54.554 --> 31:56.855
Thank you, my friend.

31:56.923 --> 31:58.623
I knew you'd come through for us.

32:01.061 --> 32:05.263
Now, let's see if we
can reach this Savior.

32:09.503 --> 32:14.506
Such powerful toys are not
meant for such disobedient boys.

32:14.608 --> 32:16.574
Mother.

32:16.643 --> 32:17.976
How did you know we were here?

32:18.078 --> 32:20.078
I led you here...

32:20.147 --> 32:23.348
just as I led your friend to my key.

32:25.886 --> 32:28.186
This whole thing...

32:28.288 --> 32:30.955
it was a test, wasn't it?

32:31.058 --> 32:32.857
From the moment you arrived,

32:32.926 --> 32:36.227
you were supposed to
be different, Gideon.

32:36.935 --> 32:40.826
You were a gift... my loyal son.

32:41.701 --> 32:43.068
Gift?

32:43.170 --> 32:45.103
You stole me from my parents.

32:45.205 --> 32:46.838
They abandoned you!

32:46.907 --> 32:49.841
I'm the one who took
you in, gave you a home,

32:49.943 --> 32:51.309
taught you, fed you,

32:51.378 --> 32:53.945
shared with you everything that I had!

32:54.047 --> 32:56.781
And this is how you repay me?

32:56.850 --> 33:00.718
I am so disappointed in you, Gideon.

33:03.323 --> 33:05.190
No.

33:05.258 --> 33:07.292
You can't intimidate me anymore.

33:07.394 --> 33:10.695
I should have stood up to you years ago.

33:10.797 --> 33:11.963
Oh, Gideon.

33:12.065 --> 33:13.932
How many times do I have to tell you?

33:14.000 --> 33:16.534
You are not a hero.

33:16.636 --> 33:18.169
Yes, I am.

33:18.238 --> 33:20.872
And I know you've been
hoarding the Black Fairy Dust.

33:20.941 --> 33:22.785
And I know you're planning to
do something terrible with it.

33:22.809 --> 33:23.920
Well, I'm not gonna let you.

33:23.944 --> 33:25.844
These people have suffered long enough.

33:25.946 --> 33:27.479
Have they?

33:28.482 --> 33:29.714
No, no, no, no, no! Stop!

33:29.816 --> 33:32.917
As far as I can see, this
one's just begun to suffer.

33:33.019 --> 33:34.019
No!

33:35.889 --> 33:37.789
How dare you use that on me!

33:37.891 --> 33:40.558
I gave you this magic!

33:40.660 --> 33:42.727
You wouldn't hurt me.

33:42.766 --> 33:44.229
Oh, Gideon.

33:44.331 --> 33:46.097
Haven't you learned?

33:46.199 --> 33:49.534
There are so many ways to hurt a person.

33:55.542 --> 33:56.941
Or a bug.

33:57.043 --> 33:58.109
No.

33:58.211 --> 34:00.345
Please... please... please don't...

34:00.447 --> 34:02.580
no!!

34:02.649 --> 34:07.352
You could've saved him
eons ago, but you didn't.

34:07.454 --> 34:09.454
This is on you, Gideon.

34:10.623 --> 34:12.023
And my boot.

34:14.561 --> 34:16.360
You're a monster.

34:17.496 --> 34:20.465
You may have stopped me, but
you can't stop The Savior.

34:20.567 --> 34:22.233
I will find her.

34:22.335 --> 34:23.935
And when I do,

34:24.004 --> 34:26.971
she will destroy you
with her light magic.

34:27.040 --> 34:28.438
You don't need to find her.

34:28.542 --> 34:30.175
I know exactly where she is.

34:32.012 --> 34:33.478
That's right.

34:33.580 --> 34:36.915
I know all about this Savior.

34:37.016 --> 34:39.583
And I have plans for her.

34:41.388 --> 34:43.655
Just as I have plans for you.

34:52.933 --> 34:57.135
Now you are mine in every way.

34:57.237 --> 35:02.874
You will do exactly
what I say... always.

35:04.578 --> 35:06.611
Now, you will find The Savior.

35:06.680 --> 35:10.848
And when you do, you will kill her.

35:10.951 --> 35:13.718
And then, when The Savior dies,

35:13.787 --> 35:16.454
the sword will do what it must...

35:16.805 --> 35:19.624
free me from this prison.

35:29.895 --> 35:32.958
I've heard tell of this place,
but I thought Pan was dead!

35:32.964 --> 35:35.431
He is. This land must have
transformed without him.

35:35.633 --> 35:38.300
If he's dead, then who in
bloody hell is chasing us?

35:38.402 --> 35:39.880
When last I left, we
rescued his minions...

35:39.904 --> 35:41.664
his Lost Boys... but
not all wanted to leave.

35:41.739 --> 35:43.350
- Some stayed.
- Who?

35:43.361 --> 35:44.393
The worst of them.

35:44.407 --> 35:46.407
And they have no love for me or anyone.

35:46.561 --> 35:49.195
Keep up, old man! The
shore is just through here!

36:11.436 --> 36:12.468
Oh, what the...?

36:12.537 --> 36:15.605
This "old man" still has
some spring in his step!

36:15.922 --> 36:17.989
Enjoy your stay, Captain!

36:18.035 --> 36:19.201
What are you doing?

36:19.207 --> 36:22.609
No way I help you... after
all your double crosses.

36:22.615 --> 36:23.946
I double-crossed you?!

36:24.182 --> 36:25.782
You just knocked me out!

36:25.850 --> 36:28.651
We're pirates! What did you expect?!

36:29.006 --> 36:31.140
And if you do manage to survive,

36:31.146 --> 36:34.081
don't forget... you owe me that ship!

36:34.087 --> 36:35.737
Captain Hook always survives.

36:35.743 --> 36:38.461
I'm counting on it!

37:02.483 --> 37:04.417
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

37:04.423 --> 37:06.198
I'll never look at
Spider-Man again the same way,

37:06.204 --> 37:07.339
but I'm fine.

37:07.345 --> 37:09.445
Rumple, where's our boy?

37:12.119 --> 37:15.420
Gideon led Emma to the
creature and left her to die.

37:16.805 --> 37:17.878
I thought you were helping him.

37:17.902 --> 37:20.588
I was, but Dark One
Junior had different plans.

37:20.594 --> 37:21.459
He played me.

37:21.465 --> 37:23.039
He came to you for help, though.

37:23.108 --> 37:24.885
Belle, I know you want to
believe the best in him,

37:24.909 --> 37:27.114
but it's like you said...
evil is not born, it is made,

37:27.120 --> 37:28.956
and that is exactly what
the Black Fairy did to him.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.702
Careful with your accusations, Ms. Swan.

37:30.708 --> 37:33.008
May I remind you... I
saved your life tonight.

37:33.051 --> 37:34.984
Because your son tried
to kill me... again.

37:35.053 --> 37:36.886
He needs help.

37:36.921 --> 37:39.288
You're a hero, Ms.
Swan. Gideon is my son.

37:39.357 --> 37:41.824
You can't keep cleaning
up his messes, Gold.

37:41.893 --> 37:44.527
He needs to take
responsibility for his actions.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.362
Are you threatening my child?

37:46.431 --> 37:48.242
I don't have a choice.
He's tried to kill me twice.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.099
I'm not gonna give him a third chance.

37:50.201 --> 37:51.601
All right, Savior.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.537
If you cross my son,

37:54.639 --> 37:56.906
I will do what I must to stop you.

37:59.944 --> 38:02.178
We didn't start this fight.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.382
Let's go home.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.694
He's ripping us apart.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.696
Gideon has been here a matter of days,

38:20.799 --> 38:22.565
and look at all the
destruction he's caused.

38:22.667 --> 38:23.833
Don't listen to them.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.693
They only see the world
in black and white.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.087
They're right.

38:29.169 --> 38:30.402
We've lost him.

38:30.408 --> 38:32.475
We could still bring
him back to us, Belle.

38:32.577 --> 38:33.643
How?

38:33.745 --> 38:36.512
Look, the Black Fairy
isn't here with him now.

38:36.614 --> 38:38.147
We are.

38:38.249 --> 38:41.017
Whatever damage that woman
did to him in the past,

38:41.290 --> 38:42.723
it's over.

38:45.857 --> 38:47.390
I promise.

38:50.862 --> 38:53.179
I'm not sure if you
can hear me, Mother...

38:54.187 --> 38:56.132
but I thought you should know...

38:57.319 --> 38:59.175
the Savior survived.

39:00.004 --> 39:02.305
Your plan failed.

39:02.407 --> 39:04.373
Did it?

39:10.348 --> 39:12.381
How?

39:12.484 --> 39:14.083
How are you here?

39:14.185 --> 39:15.451
The portal closed.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.487
You may not have killed her,

39:17.680 --> 39:19.947
but our dear spider came close enough.

39:20.043 --> 39:23.236
As her life ebbed away, the
portal opened just enough

39:23.242 --> 39:25.476
to allowed dear old Mum to slip through.

39:27.176 --> 39:28.275
Oh, Gideon.

39:28.295 --> 39:31.767
Don't tell me you underestimated me.

39:32.226 --> 39:34.618
The spider was an
ingenious stroke on my part,

39:34.624 --> 39:37.139
but you played yours to the hilt.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.808
I was under your thrall.

39:39.108 --> 39:40.572
I had no choice.

39:40.709 --> 39:41.812
True.

39:43.329 --> 39:47.049
But part of you wanted to
help me, though, didn't it?

39:50.955 --> 39:53.489
Part of you always does.

39:56.450 --> 39:58.016
Of course, Mother.

40:00.164 --> 40:01.564
Good.

40:01.820 --> 40:04.654
Because there is much to do.

40:06.504 --> 40:08.137
What the hell is that?

40:08.206 --> 40:09.505
I asked for a sports car.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.774
I wouldn't drive that to
a ping-pong tournament.

40:11.843 --> 40:14.377
Well, then you won't be
driving it to New York, either.

40:14.600 --> 40:16.673
- Back to your cell.
- Okay. Wait.

40:16.679 --> 40:18.948
Fine. I'll take it. Doesn't matter.

40:19.126 --> 40:22.127
As long as she gets me the
hell out of this town, and fast.

40:22.260 --> 40:24.992
I'm guessing the "Hamilton"
tickets are a "no"?

40:25.890 --> 40:28.257
Yeah. No one's magic's that powerful.

40:28.500 --> 40:30.366
All right, then. Adieu.

40:30.372 --> 40:31.372
Oh.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.963
And if you want to
take care of your son,

40:43.374 --> 40:46.142
I'd take a look at the book.

40:54.052 --> 40:55.551
It's the final chapter.

40:58.323 --> 41:00.456
Ah, so it is.

41:00.870 --> 41:02.503
The end of the story.

41:03.828 --> 41:05.595

no one wants to be around to see that.
