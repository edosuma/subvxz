♪ ♪

00:21.171 --> 00:24.097
Thank you, Linda.
Another perfect pour.

00:24.174 --> 00:26.475
Ugh. The phone people
keep charging us for a hot spot,

00:26.551 --> 00:28.351
whatever that is.
I'm gonna call them.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.437
Definitely. Later.
Not-not today.

00:30.514 --> 00:32.031
-May-Maybe next month.
-There you go.

00:32.107 --> 00:33.982
20% off an oil change.

00:34.059 --> 00:35.984
We're probably supposed
to be getting those.

00:36.061 --> 00:37.227
When was the last time
you got one?

00:37.229 --> 00:40.030
Last year?
Or, um, maybe the year before?

00:40.041 --> 00:41.990
I mean, definitely
since Louise was born.

00:42.067 --> 00:43.375
You really got
to stay on those, Bob.

00:43.452 --> 00:45.035
Yeah, I know, Teddy.

00:45.087 --> 00:46.378
Really helps with the lifespan
of the car.

00:46.455 --> 00:48.213
Okay, thanks. Yes, I got it.

00:48.290 --> 00:49.956
I do 'em myself. Just takes,
like, an hour or two.

00:50.033 --> 00:51.884
Three, three and a half
if you're buzzed.

00:51.960 --> 00:54.219
-You should do it yourself.
-I'm just not good

00:54.296 --> 00:56.221
at that
"being responsible" stuff.

00:56.298 --> 00:57.881
You're good
at some of that stuff.

00:57.892 --> 00:59.892
Didn't you reset our clock
the other day?

00:59.968 --> 01:01.894
-After the power went out?
-That was you.

01:01.970 --> 01:04.471
Oh, right. You just wanted
to not use that clock anymore.

01:04.548 --> 01:07.015
Well, concrete's probably dry
at Mr. Fischoeder's.

01:07.092 --> 01:09.392
I'm putting a basketball hoop
in his bathroom

01:09.403 --> 01:11.394
and a toilet
on his basketball court.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.979
That guy's life, huh?

01:13.056 --> 01:14.073
-See you later.
-Okay, bye.

01:14.149 --> 01:15.065
-Hey, guys.
-GENE: Hello.

01:15.076 --> 01:16.233
-Hey, Teddy.
-Theodore.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.734
Hey, kids. How was school?

01:17.745 --> 01:19.152
Don't worry about it.

01:19.229 --> 01:20.821
It was about four hours
too long and a little talky.

01:20.897 --> 01:22.247
Hey, remember
how I wanted to volunteer

01:22.324 --> 01:23.907
at the animal hospital
and read to animals?

01:23.918 --> 01:26.076
I don't think
that's what volunteers do.

01:26.087 --> 01:27.252
Animals don't have thumbs,
Louise.

01:27.329 --> 01:28.995
(chuckles):
They, uh, can't turn the pages.

01:29.072 --> 01:30.413
Anyway, so, you know how I need

01:30.424 --> 01:32.165
my birth certificate
for the application?

01:32.242 --> 01:34.251
Well, it's due tomorrow.
Do you guys know where that is?

01:34.261 --> 01:36.428
I do. Uh, I know where
your birth certificate is,

01:36.505 --> 01:40.599
because I very responsibly
put it in a very safe place.

01:40.676 --> 01:42.101
-Okay.
-In a safe.

01:42.177 --> 01:43.936
-A little fire safe.
-Cool.

01:44.012 --> 01:46.096
There's lots of other
important documents in there

01:46.107 --> 01:48.056
that I'm
responsibly keeping safe.

01:48.133 --> 01:49.933
Does toilet paper count
as important papers?

01:49.944 --> 01:51.226
If so, we're rich.

01:51.303 --> 01:53.103
Oh, God.
I forgot to buy toilet paper.

01:53.114 --> 01:56.106
At least there's one thing
I put in the right place.

01:56.117 --> 01:58.275
Oh, come on. Where's the key?

01:58.285 --> 02:01.120

the clapping and the talking
at the same time.

03:05.928 --> 03:08.094
-We can teach you, Tina.
-You can?

03:08.171 --> 03:10.180
Sure!
My cousin Valerie could do it,

03:10.191 --> 03:12.140
and she only had one arm.
She still does.

03:12.217 --> 03:13.475
(phone rings)

03:13.551 --> 03:15.194
-Bob's Burgers.
-Lin, it's me.

03:15.270 --> 03:16.645
-I-I need your help.
-Where are you?

03:16.721 --> 03:17.771
(sighs)
Under the bed.

03:17.847 --> 03:19.364
Do you know where
the key to the safe is?

03:19.441 --> 03:21.441
No, I have no idea.
How's it look under the bed?

03:21.518 --> 03:22.868
-Gross.
-I bet.

03:22.945 --> 03:24.444
Will you ask the kids
if they've seen it?

03:24.521 --> 03:26.205
Kids, have you seen
the key to the safe?

03:26.281 --> 03:28.540
TINA:
No. Did you ask Dad?
He seemed to be on top of it.

03:28.617 --> 03:30.200
-I'm on the phone with him.
-Tell him I say hi.

03:30.211 --> 03:31.993
-Tina says hi.
-Hi, Tina.

03:32.070 --> 03:33.378
-Dad says hi back.
-Aw.

03:33.455 --> 03:34.880
Ask Dad if he thinks I'm ready

03:34.957 --> 03:36.998
to start sharing underwear
with him.

03:37.075 --> 03:38.625
-Oof!
-LOUISE: Dad, you got this.

03:38.702 --> 03:40.502
Bob, I think Louise
is coming upstairs

03:40.578 --> 03:41.962
to jump on the bed
and squish you.

03:42.038 --> 03:44.297
Yeah, she did it.
It's really fun. And helpful.

03:44.374 --> 03:46.216
-Uh, I'm gonna hang up, Lin.
-Okay.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.551
Let's hang up at the same time.
Oh, you hung up.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.178
So, just looking everywhere,
huh?

03:50.255 --> 03:51.805
Uh-huh.
I know I bought the safe,

03:51.881 --> 03:53.047
and the key came with the safe.

03:53.125 --> 03:55.016
And I put the important stuff
in the safe.

03:55.093 --> 03:57.602
Closed the safe.
Took the key. And then I...

03:57.679 --> 03:58.904
-Threw it?
-No.

03:58.981 --> 04:01.064
Oh! And then I wanted
to put the key

04:01.075 --> 04:02.857
on my keychain
to be responsible,

04:02.934 --> 04:05.151
but I realized
I left my keys in the car.

04:05.228 --> 04:07.028
That way your car's
just ready to go.

04:07.105 --> 04:09.322
So, I went out to the car
to look for my keys,

04:09.399 --> 04:11.250
and then, uh, Hugo walked by.

04:11.326 --> 04:13.994
So I ducked down so I wouldn't
have to talk to him.

04:14.070 --> 04:15.312
-So brave.
-But then he saw me,

04:15.314 --> 04:17.330
so I, uh, I pretended
to be on a phone call.

04:17.407 --> 04:20.500
Hands-free, even though
our car doesn't have that.

04:20.577 --> 04:22.094
So, should we maybe look
in the car?

04:22.212 --> 04:23.262
No, I get carsick.

04:23.338 --> 04:26.339
-But it wouldn't be mov...
-Bye-bye.

04:26.416 --> 04:28.008
It's got to be in here.

04:28.084 --> 04:30.102
Oh, God.

04:30.178 --> 04:32.512
Right.
That doesn't open anymore.

04:32.589 --> 04:35.015
(grunts)
It's so hard to bend.

04:35.091 --> 04:37.017
What a mess. I'm a monster.

04:37.093 --> 04:38.560
Oh, there you are,

04:38.636 --> 04:40.279
screwdriver that I've rebought
a bunch of times

04:40.355 --> 04:42.063
'cause I didn't know
where you were.

04:42.140 --> 04:44.024
Jury duty summons. Perfect.

04:44.100 --> 04:46.067
I wish I knew you were there
since I'm a fugitive now,

04:46.144 --> 04:47.610
I guess.
Yep, there are the ants.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.030
You guys are still here.
H-How can I live like this?

04:50.106 --> 04:51.957
Ow! My back! Seizing up!

04:52.034 --> 04:55.035
Aah! Ow!
(grunting)

04:55.111 --> 04:57.963
-Hi. How are you?
-I'm fine. You okay?

04:58.040 --> 05:00.290
(exhales)
Yeah, yeah. Couldn't be happier.

05:00.301 --> 05:02.208
-All right.
-(whimpers)

05:02.285 --> 05:04.419
Okay, if I...
If I lay like this...

05:04.496 --> 05:05.971
(panting)

05:06.048 --> 05:07.380
This feels better.

05:07.457 --> 05:09.382
This is gonna fix itself,
and then I...

05:09.459 --> 05:11.092
and then I'll look
for the keys some more.

05:11.169 --> 05:12.978
Oh, lying down
reminds me that I'm tired.

05:13.055 --> 05:14.554
I'm always tired.

05:14.631 --> 05:15.972
Just gonna close my eyes
for a minute.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.475
But I'm not gonna fall asleep.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.935
Oh, God. I fell asleep.
What time is it?

05:21.012 --> 05:24.064
Where am I? Am I dreaming?

05:24.140 --> 05:26.325
Am I tiny?
I think I might be tiny.

05:26.401 --> 05:28.234
Pens. Maps.

05:28.311 --> 05:30.278
Am I in my glove compartment?

05:30.355 --> 05:33.081
Wow, that insurance
is very expired.

05:35.502 --> 05:36.710
(Bob snoring)

05:38.580 --> 05:42.165
Okay, either I'm actually tiny
and I'm in my glove compartment

05:42.217 --> 05:43.958
and I should maybe be
a superhero,

05:44.035 --> 05:47.837
or I'm dreaming, because
I'm a sleepy, middle-aged man,

05:47.848 --> 05:48.680
and I fall asleep a lot.

05:48.757 --> 05:50.423
VOICE:
If you're dreaming,

05:50.500 --> 05:52.184
-then am I dreaming?
-Who said that?

05:52.260 --> 05:54.427
Me! Rubber Band Squeezy Ball.

05:54.504 --> 05:56.355
What's it been?
Like, seven years?

05:56.431 --> 05:58.640
Pr-Probably, yeah. I'm sorry

05:58.716 --> 06:00.859
about the glove compartment
not opening, Squeezy Ball.

06:00.936 --> 06:02.811
Yeah, it's like a tomb in here.

06:02.887 --> 06:05.480
Man, we used to have
some good times, huh?

06:05.557 --> 06:07.524
You would find a rubber band
every once in a while

06:07.534 --> 06:09.442
and then add it on to me.

06:09.519 --> 06:10.985
(chuckles)
Yeah.

06:11.062 --> 06:12.946
And you'd squeeze me
while you were driving.

06:13.022 --> 06:15.031
That was, um,
that was our thing.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.950
And you'd come up
with ideas, right?

06:17.026 --> 06:18.326
Ideas for burgers and stuff.

06:18.403 --> 06:20.203
I-I-I... I guess I would.

06:20.214 --> 06:23.957
Ah, man, your restaurant
must be so successful by now.

06:24.033 --> 06:26.209
What? Oh. No.
I mean, we're open.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.837
Hey, um, have you seen
a little key?

06:28.913 --> 06:30.555
It's really small.
It's, like, uh...

06:30.632 --> 06:33.892
Oh. I mean, it was small.
It-It's about this big?

06:33.969 --> 06:36.010
-It's for our safe.
-You got a safe?

06:36.087 --> 06:38.555
Look at you!
For all your restaurant money?

06:38.565 --> 06:41.900
No, it's for, um,
uh, important papers.

06:41.977 --> 06:45.019
Wow. I know someone
that has important papers!

06:45.096 --> 06:47.021
(chuckles)
I've missed you, Squeezy.

06:47.098 --> 06:49.315
(exhales)
I don't know about your key,

06:49.392 --> 06:51.860
but you know who might be able
to help? Tape!

06:51.936 --> 06:54.904
-Tape?
-Yeah. Your old self-help tape,

06:54.915 --> 06:58.658
<i> Strategies for Living:</i>
<i> How to Become a Strategenius.</i>

06:58.735 --> 07:00.493

07:02.447 --> 07:04.164
Not as much as I should have.

-Your back hurts in your dream?

10:02.010 --> 10:03.935
I mean,
once you have back problems,

10:04.012 --> 10:05.437
you kinda always have
back problems.

SQUEEZY BALL: I love the fact

Uh, I don't know

10:23.290 --> 10:25.907
I-I didn't listen

10:25.983 --> 10:27.617
Why would I remember
the guy who bought me,

10:27.628 --> 10:29.794
listened to three minutes of me,
and then left me

10:29.871 --> 10:31.579
on the dirtiest floor
in the world?

10:31.656 --> 10:33.456
I haven't been thinking
about you at all.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.750
-Oh, I'm sor...
-And that's an example

10:35.827 --> 10:38.378
of passive-aggressive behavior,
which is not helpful.

10:38.454 --> 10:41.297
We cover that in chapter nine,
which I guess you'll never hear.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.308
That's not passive-aggressive,
what I just said.

10:43.385 --> 10:44.976
I really think
you'll never hear it.

10:45.053 --> 10:45.977
Bob's a millionaire.

10:46.054 --> 10:47.220
Uh, I-I... No, I'm...
(chuckles)

10:47.296 --> 10:49.430
I'm not. Uh, hey,
I-I need your help.

10:49.507 --> 10:50.723
Yes. Yes, you do.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.893
Right. In general
but also with finding a key.

10:53.970 --> 10:54.986
A silver key.

10:55.063 --> 10:56.312
Bob, I don't know
where the key is.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.106
But to be effective
in this situation,

10:58.182 --> 11:00.158
you'll need to energize,
synthesize,

11:00.235 --> 11:01.609
then synergize.

11:01.686 --> 11:03.569
Um, I know what one of those is.

11:03.646 --> 11:04.946
But what-what do I do?

11:05.022 --> 11:06.906
Divide the car into quadrants,

11:06.983 --> 11:08.282
so you have attainable goals.

11:08.359 --> 11:09.909
I'm still not following.

11:09.986 --> 11:11.077
You got to look under the seat.

11:11.154 --> 11:12.453
That's what I was doing
when I hurt my back.

11:12.530 --> 11:14.172
-Of course you did.
-Yeah, I'm, uh...

11:14.249 --> 11:15.331

So, Bob,
priority level one to five,

11:40.867 --> 11:42.859
-where does staying alive rate?
-Oh, uh, five.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.203
-One is the most.
-Oh, sorry. Then one.

11:45.280 --> 11:48.156
Uh, uh, staying alive is
very important to me right now.

11:48.232 --> 11:50.366
All right, I was worried when
you said five, to be honest.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.285
-Me, too.
-Well, I got confused
by your system,

11:52.361 --> 11:54.454
because it's the oppo...
I... Whatever.

11:54.530 --> 11:56.548
-Wh-What should we do here?
-Now that I know our goal is
to stay alive,

11:56.624 --> 12:00.051
let's assess our options
and make an action plan.

12:00.128 --> 12:02.628
I love that. Action plan
sounds great right now.

12:02.705 --> 12:04.213

for ideas, Bob?

12:04.224 --> 12:06.891
Uh, Squeezy, I feel like Tape's
got a good handle on things.

12:06.968 --> 12:09.469
-Right, Tape?
-Life doesn't give you
handles, Bob.

12:09.545 --> 12:11.387
You have to install them
yourself.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.972
See that pencil?
Grab it.

12:13.049 --> 12:14.182
Okay. Um...

12:14.258 --> 12:16.142
(grunting)
I-I got it.

12:16.219 --> 12:17.569
Bob, stick it
through my right eye

12:17.645 --> 12:19.562
and then hold on for dear life.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.072
Your eye?
Won't that hurt?

12:21.149 --> 12:22.148
(sarcastically):
No, it'll feel good.

12:22.225 --> 12:23.816
Just do it! Now!

12:23.893 --> 12:24.968
-BOB: Uh...
-Does "now"

12:24.970 --> 12:27.195

the same thing to you or...?

12:27.271 --> 12:28.196
Okay, okay!

12:28.272 --> 12:30.081

drop to reactivate the flavors.

-Yes!

12:54.516 --> 12:56.349
