00:02.500 --> 00:03.900
I have a question.

00:03.967 --> 00:05.201
Yeah?

00:05.267 --> 00:07.134
How smart do you have
to be to have sex?

00:09.600 --> 00:10.368
Well, actually...

00:10.434 --> 00:11.767
Uh-uh-uh...

00:12.400 --> 00:13.034
Can I...?

00:13.101 --> 00:13.667
Uh-uh-uh...

00:14.400 --> 00:15.101
But I was...

00:15.166 --> 00:15.900
Uh-uh-uh!

00:16.767 --> 00:17.367
Oh, come on.

00:17.433 --> 00:18.800
Uh-uh-uh!

00:23.300 --> 00:24.867
Why do you ask?

00:24.934 --> 00:26.567
Mom's boyfriend's a doctor.

00:26.634 --> 00:27.867
Yeah?

00:27.934 --> 00:29.734
And doctors are supposed
to be smart, right?

00:29.800 --> 00:32.567
Not as smart as they
think they are, but, uh...

00:32.634 --> 00:33.567
but go ahead.

00:33.634 --> 00:34.867
Well, when I'm in bed,

00:34.934 --> 00:36.133
<i>I can hear them in bed.</i>

00:36.200 --> 00:36.767
Oh, God.

00:36.834 --> 00:37.600
Oh, boy.

00:37.667 --> 00:39.400
Oh, goody.

00:40.867 --> 00:42.467
And Mom's always
telling him that

00:42.533 --> 00:43.834
he doesn't know
what he's doing.

00:45.133 --> 00:48.400
How much do I love this kid?

00:48.467 --> 00:49.934
Don't interrupt, Charlie.

00:50.001 --> 00:52.400
Go on, sweetheart.

00:52.467 --> 00:55.133
So I'm thinking sex must be
a lot harder than I figured.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.934
I mean, she has to tell him
the same thing every night.

00:58.001 --> 01:00.067
Every night, you say?

01:00.133 --> 01:01.067
Berta.

01:01.133 --> 01:02.200
You had a semi-annual

01:02.266 --> 01:04.066
subscription, didn't you?

01:05.600 --> 01:07.101
Come on, you guys, please?

01:08.333 --> 01:09.667
Can't help you.
Sorry, no.

01:11.133 --> 01:12.667
Look, Jake, it's, it's not

01:12.734 --> 01:14.934
that you have to be particularly
smart to have sex.

01:15.001 --> 01:16.867
BOTH:
Yeah, look at your dad.

01:18.333 --> 01:20.667
Jinx, you owe me a Coke.

01:20.734 --> 01:22.667
Think of it this way.

01:22.734 --> 01:24.600
Suppose you like
banana cream pie.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.300
<i>I do like banana
cream pie.</i>

01:26.367 --> 01:27.300
Well, good.

01:27.367 --> 01:28.300
Do we have any?

01:28.367 --> 01:29.934
No.

01:30.001 --> 01:31.834
Well, then, why'd
you bring it up?

01:31.900 --> 01:34.467
I was trying to tell you
something about sex.

01:34.533 --> 01:36.533
What does pie have
to do with sex?

01:37.500 --> 01:38.101
Can I jump in...?

01:38.166 --> 01:39.800
Uh-uh-uh!

01:39.867 --> 01:40.934
How about me?

01:41.001 --> 01:42.367
Excuse me, but if I can't talk,

01:42.433 --> 01:43.600
you can't talk.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.600
Am I right, Alan?

01:45.667 --> 01:47.133
Anyway...

01:47.200 --> 01:48.634
If you don't
tell me

01:48.700 --> 01:51.300
you like banana cream pie
and I keep bringing home

01:51.367 --> 01:53.400
something else...
But I just told you
I like it.

01:53.467 --> 01:54.700
You want to know

01:54.767 --> 01:56.467
what kind of pie
your Uncle Charlie likes?

01:56.533 --> 01:57.634
Uh-uh!

01:57.700 --> 01:59.333
Oh, come on, I...

01:59.400 --> 02:00.266
Uh-uh-uh!

02:01.166 --> 02:02.467
I'm guessing cherry.

02:02.533 --> 02:04.001
Uh-uh-uh!

02:06.567 --> 02:08.300
Please, I've got this.

02:08.366 --> 02:11.400
You've got squat.

02:11.467 --> 02:12.800
At this rate, the kid's only

02:12.867 --> 02:15.634
gonna get a stiffie
at Marie Callendar's.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.001
Okay. Okay.

02:17.067 --> 02:18.734
Forget the pie.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.500
Uncle Charlie
said "stiffie."

02:23.266 --> 02:24.500
Yeah, I heard him.

02:24.567 --> 02:26.867
My point is,
you don't have to worry

02:26.934 --> 02:28.500
about being smart enough
to have sex, okay?

02:28.567 --> 02:30.067
Okay.

02:31.834 --> 02:33.767
In fact, there are times

02:33.834 --> 02:38.433
when brains and imagination
are a distinct disadvantage.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.067
Like when you've been
married for 12 years

02:40.133 --> 02:41.400
and you're only allowed to do

02:41.467 --> 02:43.667
the same three things
over and over again.

02:43.734 --> 02:46.001
In exactly
the same way

02:46.067 --> 02:47.467
and exactly the same order.

02:47.533 --> 02:49.433
like you were some kind
of unthinking machine

02:49.500 --> 02:51.500
or a trained fricking monkey.

02:55.667 --> 02:59.133
Okay. Honestly, how much more
damage could we have caused?

03:00.600 --> 03:04.133
I bet monkeys
like banana cream pie.

03:38.900 --> 03:39.600
Hi, honey.

03:39.605 --> 03:41.105
Hi, Mom.
What's in the box?

03:41.172 --> 03:42.172
Banana cream pie.

03:44.971 --> 03:47.072
You bought him a whole pie?

03:47.138 --> 03:49.572
I bought him two pies.

03:49.639 --> 03:51.472
Why would you do that?

03:51.539 --> 03:54.572
It seemed easier than explaining
to him that his mother's fiancé

03:54.639 --> 03:56.038
isn't really a sexual moron.

03:58.005 --> 03:58.938
Oh, hey, Alan.

03:59.005 --> 04:00.072
Herb.

04:00.138 --> 04:03.205
Why is Jake eating
pie in the bathroom?

04:03.272 --> 04:04.339
Not now, not now.

04:04.405 --> 04:05.838
What are you
talking about?

04:05.905 --> 04:08.605
Jake can hear you two in bed.

04:08.672 --> 04:10.739
Oh, God.

04:10.806 --> 04:12.339
Oh, God.

04:12.405 --> 04:13.605
He didn't hear that.

04:20.605 --> 04:21.706
Um...

04:21.772 --> 04:23.938
Wh-What, what did
he say to you?

04:24.005 --> 04:27.072
Well, uh, basically he's worried
that when he grows up,

04:27.138 --> 04:28.971
he won't be smart enough
to have sex

04:29.038 --> 04:30.639
Why would he
think that?

04:30.706 --> 04:32.772
Because he hears you
giving Herb instructions

04:32.838 --> 04:34.905
like he's a blind guy
in a mine field.

04:40.539 --> 04:42.038
You think that's funny?

04:42.105 --> 04:48.105
No.

04:48.172 --> 04:49.505
Well, I will talk to him.

04:49.572 --> 04:51.772
No, no. Trust me, talking
only makes it worse.

04:51.838 --> 04:53.005
Charlie and I tried.

04:53.072 --> 04:54.639
Oh, great, Charlie
knows about this?

04:54.706 --> 04:56.205
That's not the point,
Judith. The point is,

04:56.272 --> 04:57.772
you need to be a
little less vocal.

04:57.838 --> 04:59.706
Maybe do what you did
with me and smack him

04:59.772 --> 05:01.639
on the back of the head
when he goes off course.

05:01.706 --> 05:03.038
She does that, too.

05:05.605 --> 05:06.871
Well, um...

05:06.938 --> 05:08.905
Thank you, Alan,
I will take care of this.

05:12.806 --> 05:14.205
Um...

05:14.272 --> 05:15.871
I'm sorry to dump this on you.

05:15.938 --> 05:17.305
Oh, that's okay.

05:17.372 --> 05:18.871
I mean, you know,
I'm, I'm not judging.

05:18.938 --> 05:20.539
I've been in your position.

05:20.605 --> 05:22.138
Well, she only likes the one.

05:26.605 --> 05:28.505
Yeah, yeah. Been
there, done that.

05:28.572 --> 05:29.505
Mm-hmm.

05:29.572 --> 05:30.838
Or, more correctly,

05:30.905 --> 05:33.238
Uh, been there,
told I was doing that wrong.

05:33.305 --> 05:34.539
Oh, yeah.

05:34.605 --> 05:36.539
The truth is, I, uh...

05:36.605 --> 05:37.905
I kind of like the instructions.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.739
It takes out all the guesswork.

05:39.806 --> 05:41.772
Sure. Sure.

05:41.838 --> 05:45.706
I tend to meander when I don't
have, you know, a game plan.

05:45.772 --> 05:47.739
Yeah, well, that's never
a problem with Judith.

05:47.806 --> 05:50.971
She's the Vince Lombardi
of sexual intercourse.

05:51.038 --> 05:53.639
Well, she did teach me
to play through the pain.

05:56.105 --> 05:59.172
Yeah. Tape it up
and get back in there.

06:00.172 --> 06:02.138
Say good-bye, Herb.

06:02.205 --> 06:05.505
Bye.
Bye.

06:07.439 --> 06:10.339
(...throws it to the quarterback
and Miller has gotta stand back.)

06:10.405 --> 06:11.871
(He's got it
at the one-yard line!)

06:12.938 --> 06:13.871
Hey.

06:13.938 --> 06:14.871
Hey.

06:14.938 --> 06:16.405
How'd it go with Judith?

06:16.472 --> 06:19.539
It was the most awkward
and uncomfortable conversation

06:19.605 --> 06:21.605
I've had in my life.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.739
Huh. More awkward
than when you were a kid

06:23.806 --> 06:26.072
and had to explain to Mom
why you were hiding

06:26.138 --> 06:28.739
a slab of raw liver
in your sock drawer?

06:30.605 --> 06:32.405
Okay, the second most awkward.

06:32.472 --> 06:34.605
What about when she found
the warm cantaloupe

06:34.672 --> 06:36.138
with a face drawn on it?

06:36.205 --> 06:38.739
All right,
this was in the top five.

06:38.806 --> 06:40.272
I mean...

06:40.339 --> 06:43.405
it's just unnatural for a guy
to have to tell his ex-wife

06:43.472 --> 06:45.772
to pipe down while she's
having sex with another man.

06:45.838 --> 06:47.172
I'll tell you what's unnatural.

06:47.238 --> 06:49.739
The look on that melon's face.

06:52.105 --> 06:54.572
Fruit should not look surprised.

07:04.505 --> 07:06.172
You're the one who gave me
that idea.

07:06.238 --> 07:07.539
I was joking.

07:07.605 --> 07:10.272
You told me it was what
the astronauts do.

07:10.339 --> 07:13.505
Oh, right.

07:13.572 --> 07:16.238
That's how I got you to
pee in the Tang jar.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.505
Oh, and let's not forget

07:20.572 --> 07:24.072
how I convinced you Mom's douche
bag was your air supply.

07:26.072 --> 07:27.838
Yeah. Yeah.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.905
My breath smelled like vinegar
for two weeks.

07:32.572 --> 07:35.238
Ah... those were
innocent times.

07:40.639 --> 07:43.505
Oh, the kitchen appliances are a
little outdated, but you people

07:43.572 --> 07:45.639
can cook with your wrist
watches now, can't you?

07:47.372 --> 07:48.339
You're funny.

07:48.405 --> 07:50.572
You're a funny firecracker.

07:51.572 --> 07:52.838
Mom?

07:52.905 --> 07:54.272
Oh. Charlie.

07:54.339 --> 07:56.072
Say hello to Hiroshi Goto.

07:56.138 --> 07:57.706
Hi.
Hello.

07:57.772 --> 08:00.205
Charlie is my number one son.

08:01.472 --> 08:03.905
Yeah, but she treats me
like number two.

08:06.205 --> 08:07.539
Mom, can I talk to
you for a minute?

08:07.605 --> 08:08.739
Well, of course, darling.

08:08.806 --> 08:10.339
Hiroshi, why don't you go

08:10.405 --> 08:11.772
enjoy the view from the deck?

08:11.838 --> 08:13.138
There's usually pretty girls

08:13.205 --> 08:14.539
playing volleyball
out on the beach.

08:14.605 --> 08:17.539
<i>Oh. I like volleyball.</i>

08:19.871 --> 08:21.505
All right, here's
what you need to know.

08:21.572 --> 08:23.905
He's filthy rich and he's
looking for a house on the beach

08:23.971 --> 08:25.772
<i>and I have nothing
to show him.</i>

08:25.838 --> 08:28.138
<i>So you're selling him my house?</i>

08:28.205 --> 08:31.005
Don't worry. I told him you were
going through an ugly divorce,

08:31.072 --> 08:34.138
but before we close escrow,
you'll reconcile with Sheryl

08:34.205 --> 08:36.238
and back out of the sale.

08:36.304 --> 08:38.138
Who's Sheryl?

08:38.205 --> 08:41.405
She is a sweet,
selfless girl

08:41.472 --> 08:43.739
who worked nights to put
you through law school

08:43.806 --> 08:45.739
while you were sleeping
with her sister.

08:47.706 --> 08:50.472
Anyway, I have to string
Mr. Goto along until I have

08:50.539 --> 08:52.539
something to show him that
actually is for sale.

08:52.605 --> 08:55.305
Oh, I understand.

08:55.372 --> 08:58.005
It's called a bait-and-switch
and it's a felony.

08:58.072 --> 09:02.772
Oh, well, look at you
taking the moral high ground.

09:02.838 --> 09:05.472
And with nary a bottle
or whore in sight.

09:06.905 --> 09:08.372
Bravo.

09:08.439 --> 09:12.172
Uh, excuse me, why is there
an Asian man on the deck?

09:12.238 --> 09:14.005
Mom's selling my house.

09:14.072 --> 09:14.905
Why?

09:14.971 --> 09:17.038
Marital problems.

09:17.105 --> 09:19.405
You cheating bastard.

09:20.539 --> 09:22.105
Do I have to find
another place to live?

09:22.172 --> 09:25.238
Yes.

09:25.305 --> 09:26.439
Don't worry, sweetheart.

09:26.505 --> 09:28.672
Mommy's just running
a little scam.

09:28.739 --> 09:30.838
But feel free to find
another place to live.

09:30.905 --> 09:33.238
Anyway, what's new?

09:33.305 --> 09:34.439
How's my grandson?

09:34.505 --> 09:35.905
Oh, he's, he's fine.

09:35.971 --> 09:39.038
Oh, come on, Alan,
tell her about the pie.

09:40.339 --> 09:41.205
What pie?

09:41.272 --> 09:42.539
There's no pie.

09:42.605 --> 09:44.305
Jake overheard his mother...

09:44.372 --> 09:46.639
(spouts gibberish)

09:46.706 --> 09:48.105
It's nothing.

09:48.172 --> 09:50.806
I just had to have a rather
embarrassing conversation

09:50.871 --> 09:52.339
with Judith yesterday.

09:52.405 --> 09:54.205
More embarrassing than when
you were 11 years old,

09:54.272 --> 09:57.639
and I caught you with the dog
and the peanut butter.

09:59.806 --> 10:01.905
You went and did that, too?

10:01.971 --> 10:06.739
You told me it was what the
cowboys did on a cattle drive.

10:06.806 --> 10:08.405
And I didn't have a cow.

10:10.372 --> 10:12.172
Is that why
you got rid of our dog?

10:12.238 --> 10:14.472
I couldn't look at him anymore.

10:18.105 --> 10:19.405
Can we move on? Please?

10:19.472 --> 10:21.238
I'm sorry, dear.
Now, what about Jake?

10:21.305 --> 10:23.572
I loved that dog.

10:23.639 --> 10:25.405
Well, not as much
as your brother did.

10:27.472 --> 10:30.871
But go ahead, Alan, what did you
have to talk to Judith about?

10:30.938 --> 10:32.339
Nothing. Forget it.

10:32.405 --> 10:33.772
Oh, come on, Alan.

10:33.838 --> 10:36.938
The dog whisperer here
got bent all out of shape

10:37.005 --> 10:38.572
'cause Jake caught
his mother going at it

10:38.639 --> 10:39.672
with her new boyfriend.

10:39.739 --> 10:41.405
That's it? He just heard them?

10:41.472 --> 10:42.905
That's not enough
to traumatize him?

10:42.971 --> 10:44.739
Absolutely not.

10:44.806 --> 10:46.339
See, Alan, I told you.

10:46.405 --> 10:47.838
You would know, Charlie.

10:47.905 --> 10:49.305
What do you mean?

10:49.372 --> 10:51.238
You don't remember?

10:51.305 --> 10:52.639
Remember what?

10:52.706 --> 10:54.572
Nothing.

10:56.172 --> 10:56.971
I like it!

10:57.038 --> 10:58.938
Of course you do.

10:59.005 --> 11:00.605
Let me show you
the master suite.

11:00.672 --> 11:02.539
That's where
she caught him.

11:02.605 --> 11:05.439
Ah, cheating bastard.

11:07.539 --> 11:09.572
What am I supposed to remember?

11:09.639 --> 11:11.472
I was the only one
that gave that dog

11:11.539 --> 11:12.672
any kind of attention.

11:19.305 --> 11:20.639
No...

11:29.205 --> 11:31.439
I remember.

11:48.511 --> 11:49.744
Charlie?

11:49.811 --> 11:51.345
Yeah?

11:51.412 --> 11:53.844
What are you doing?

11:53.911 --> 11:56.178
Drinking.

11:56.245 --> 11:59.811
Why are you
doing it here?

11:59.878 --> 12:02.045
I can't be alone
right now.

12:02.111 --> 12:05.911
Okay. What's going on?

12:05.978 --> 12:09.911
I remembered, Alan.

12:09.978 --> 12:11.978
Remembered what?

12:12.045 --> 12:16.644
I was eight years old,
it was late at night.

12:16.711 --> 12:18.611
I must have had a bad dream
or something

12:18.678 --> 12:22.178
'cause I walked into Mom's room
and I saw them.

12:22.245 --> 12:25.211
Saw who?

12:25.278 --> 12:27.911
Mom and some guy.

12:27.978 --> 12:29.577
They didn't hear me
at first

12:29.644 --> 12:33.145
'cause the water bed
was making a lot of
sloshing noises.

12:33.211 --> 12:36.678
At least I hope
it was the water bed.

12:36.744 --> 12:39.544
Oh, yeah,
Mom's water bed.

12:39.611 --> 12:41.211
Remember how we
used to bounce

12:41.278 --> 12:43.312
up and down on it playing
lumberjack and...?

12:43.378 --> 12:44.611
Will you forget
the damn bed?!

12:44.678 --> 12:46.611
The bed's not important.

12:46.678 --> 12:49.878
Sorry.

12:49.945 --> 12:51.444
Anyway,

12:51.511 --> 12:54.278
at some point they realized
I was standing there,

12:54.345 --> 12:58.011
and the guy said to me,
"Don't worry, Speed Racer,

12:58.078 --> 12:59.412
I'm not hurting your mom."

13:00.412 --> 13:01.511
Speed Racer?

13:01.577 --> 13:04.577
Remember, I had
the Speed Racer pajamas?

13:04.644 --> 13:06.878
Oh, yeah, yeah,
our Christmas pajamas.

13:06.945 --> 13:10.444
Yeah, you got Speed Racer
and I got Laverne & Shirley.

13:10.511 --> 13:13.711
So typical.

13:13.778 --> 13:15.577
This is not about you, Alan!

13:15.644 --> 13:17.878
This is about
a horrible moment
in my life

13:17.945 --> 13:19.844
that I completely
repressed:

13:19.911 --> 13:23.778
Mom and the man with
the big red mustache.

13:23.844 --> 13:26.011
Oh, God.

13:26.078 --> 13:30.544
I just realized why Yosemite Sam
always made me nauseous.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.611
And I'll tell you
the worst part.

13:34.678 --> 13:36.178
Worse than Laverne & Shirley
pajamas?

13:36.245 --> 13:37.611
Alan...

13:37.678 --> 13:41.577
I am amazed
I'm not a raging queen.

13:41.644 --> 13:43.444
We all are.

13:46.878 --> 13:50.678
Anyway, the next morning
I asked Mom what happened

13:50.744 --> 13:53.111
and she said she didn't know
what I was talking about.

13:53.178 --> 13:56.345
And when I kept asking,
she threw a shoe at my head.

13:56.412 --> 13:59.011
Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah,
the four-inch heels.

13:59.078 --> 14:00.577
Oh, she was deadly accurate
with those.

14:00.644 --> 14:02.678
She could knock
a melon out of your hands

14:02.744 --> 14:04.444
from clear across
the room.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.678
Will you get your mind
out of the produce section?

14:07.744 --> 14:08.844
I've got a problem here.

14:08.911 --> 14:11.245
Come on, Charlie.
It happened years ago

14:11.312 --> 14:12.511
and you turned out...

14:12.577 --> 14:14.378
Yeah, you got a problem.

14:14.444 --> 14:16.111
Thank you.

14:16.178 --> 14:17.678
I got to tell you,

14:17.744 --> 14:19.945
it does help me feel
a little better about Jake.

14:20.011 --> 14:21.544
I mean, he didn't see
anything,

14:21.611 --> 14:23.844
and at least we haven't
been lying to him

14:23.911 --> 14:25.378
about having sex.

14:25.477 --> 14:29.412
No, no, you just taught him
to associate sex with pie.

14:29.477 --> 14:31.945
Hey, at least I didn't
talk him into

14:32.011 --> 14:35.345
putting crotchless panties
on a Butterball turkey.

14:35.412 --> 14:37.978
Oh, right.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.644
Best Thanksgiving ever.

14:41.444 --> 14:45.378
You told me it's how
the pilgrims got through
the harsh winter.

14:50.978 --> 14:53.711
Oh, come on. He's got
to be asleep by now.

14:53.778 --> 14:55.544
It doesn't matter.
He could wake up.

14:55.611 --> 14:56.911
So we'll be quiet.

14:56.978 --> 14:58.345
I can't be quiet.

14:58.412 --> 15:01.444
Oh, come on.
Please?

15:01.511 --> 15:02.711
Oh, all right.

15:05.312 --> 15:08.412
No, no, not that way.

15:08.477 --> 15:10.078
Slow down!

15:11.444 --> 15:13.245
I'm still awake!

15:17.111 --> 15:18.145
Are you happy?

15:18.211 --> 15:20.245
I may never be
happy again.

15:21.444 --> 15:23.045
Mm, pie.

15:29.978 --> 15:32.711
Rose, did you ever
suddenly remember something

15:32.778 --> 15:35.111
that you blocked out
years ago?

15:35.178 --> 15:36.544
You mean like
a repressed memory?

15:36.611 --> 15:37.811
Yeah.

15:37.878 --> 15:40.045
Yeah. You ever had
a repressed memory?

15:40.111 --> 15:42.111
I forget.

15:44.011 --> 15:47.078
Get it?
A little psychology humor.

15:47.145 --> 15:48.878
Freud was the first one
to use it.

15:48.945 --> 15:50.744
Aha.

15:50.811 --> 15:52.345
It's much funnier
in German.

15:52.412 --> 15:56.378
<i>Hast due mals gehabt ein
unterdrucktes Gedachtnis?</i>

15:56.444 --> 15:58.011
<i>Ich vergesse.</i>

16:00.678 --> 16:03.878
So what memory
did you repress?

16:03.945 --> 16:08.511
When I was eight, I walked in
on my mother having sex.

16:08.577 --> 16:09.644
Interesting.

16:09.711 --> 16:11.145
Interesting?

16:11.211 --> 16:15.078
How about devastating,
horrifying, traumatizing?

16:15.145 --> 16:19.178
Wow. What, was she, like,
blindfolded and tied to a bed

16:19.245 --> 16:22.412
while two guys slapped
her butt with Ping-Pong paddles?

16:22.477 --> 16:24.945
No.

16:25.011 --> 16:28.778
Hmm. Was she riding around
the room on a goat

16:28.844 --> 16:30.577
while an albino midget
dripped honey...?

16:30.644 --> 16:34.412
No, no! No.

16:34.477 --> 16:35.678
It was just sex.

16:35.744 --> 16:37.412
One mother, one man.

16:37.477 --> 16:38.611
(singsongy):
Boring.

16:38.678 --> 16:41.412
Oh, come on, Charlie.

16:41.477 --> 16:43.611
It's not an uncommon occurrence.

16:43.678 --> 16:46.711
I myself have walked in
on many people having sex.

16:46.778 --> 16:48.111
Accidentally?

16:48.178 --> 16:52.245
My point is, you've recovered
the memory,

16:52.312 --> 16:53.978
and you can get on
with your life.

16:54.045 --> 16:56.611
No, I can't.

16:56.678 --> 17:00.111
What if it's not the
only repressed memory?

17:00.178 --> 17:03.078
What else is lying
just below the surface

17:03.145 --> 17:05.444
ready to burst into
my consciousness?

17:05.511 --> 17:07.078
Am I going to wake up
tonight remembing

17:07.145 --> 17:09.311
my mother in the shower
with my Uncle Donald?

17:09.377 --> 17:14.611
Who I suddenly realized
wasn't really my uncle?

17:14.678 --> 17:16.844
Sounds like you don't have
to worry about that one anymore.

17:16.911 --> 17:20.011
Oh, God, it's
all coming back.

17:20.078 --> 17:22.810
Uncle Donald,
Uncle Steve...

17:22.877 --> 17:24.544
Uncle Jorge.

17:26.544 --> 17:28.978
I bet I wasn't related
to any of those guys.

17:29.045 --> 17:30.978
This is all good, Charlie.
Keep going.

17:31.045 --> 17:32.011
Oh, boy.

17:32.078 --> 17:33.644
What?

17:33.711 --> 17:37.245
Not only was Aunt
Wendy not my aunt,

17:37.312 --> 17:39.778
there was no snakebite
on her boob.

17:44.744 --> 17:46.378
Oh, hey.
What are you doing here?

17:46.444 --> 17:49.278
Uh, well,
we were hoping that...

17:49.345 --> 17:52.145
Actually, I was hoping
that, uh, maybe...

17:52.211 --> 17:53.178
He wants me
to stay here tonight

17:53.245 --> 17:54.778
so he and Mom can have sex.

17:54.844 --> 17:59.245
Oh. Jake, I'm sure that's not
the reason, right, Herb?

17:59.312 --> 18:01.178
No, that's pretty much it.

18:02.211 --> 18:04.111
Excuse me.

18:04.178 --> 18:05.511
Where are you going?

18:05.577 --> 18:07.911
To tell Mom that her
indiscriminate bed-hopping

18:07.978 --> 18:09.945
has scarred me for life.

18:11.312 --> 18:13.477
Jury's still out on me.

18:23.312 --> 18:25.511
What do you want,
Charlie?

18:25.577 --> 18:27.544
We need to talk.

18:27.611 --> 18:28.778
You should have
called first.

18:28.844 --> 18:30.145
I'm a little under
the weather.

18:30.211 --> 18:33.345
Yeah, well, I'm not feeling
so great myself.

18:33.412 --> 18:34.878
I've started remembering things.

18:34.945 --> 18:36.511
Well, call the poor girls,

18:36.577 --> 18:38.844
apologize and stop
drinking so much.

18:38.911 --> 18:42.011
No, I'm remembering things
about you.

18:42.078 --> 18:44.978
Things from my childhood.

18:46.145 --> 18:47.577
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

18:47.644 --> 18:51.945
You can't even look at me,
can you?

18:52.011 --> 18:54.878
I don't care what you
think you remember.

18:54.945 --> 18:56.644
I was a terrific mother
who loved you

18:56.711 --> 18:59.178
even though you were
a horrible little boy.

18:59.245 --> 19:00.678
Now go away.

19:02.644 --> 19:05.045
Mom, this is important!

19:05.111 --> 19:07.312
Mom?

19:09.378 --> 19:11.911
You ruined Yosemite Sam for me!

19:16.911 --> 19:19.945
Dagnabit, this isn't over.

19:30.911 --> 19:31.844
Oh, God!

19:31.911 --> 19:34.045
Charlie?

19:34.111 --> 19:36.844
Don't worry, slugger.
I'm not hurting your mother.

19:44.656 --> 19:47.800
OK,i have to catch my bus.

19:47.805 --> 19:49.339
Good night, Berta.

19:49.406 --> 19:51.705
Hey, Dad, guess
what I found in
Mom's bedroom.

19:51.772 --> 19:54.406
You know what?
I'll take a cab.

19:54.471 --> 19:56.605
An empty canof whipped cream.

19:56.672 --> 19:59.805
Whipped cream. No kidding?

19:59.872 --> 20:01.339
Yep. And you know
what I'm thinking?

20:01.406 --> 20:02.406
I know
what I'm thinking.

20:02.471 --> 20:04.005
Uh-uh-uh!

20:05.505 --> 20:06.905
What?

20:06.972 --> 20:09.172
Either whipped cream
has something to do with sex,

20:09.239 --> 20:12.039
or Mom hides pie
in her nightstand, too.

20:12.105 --> 20:13.505
Hey, a gal can do both.

20:13.571 --> 20:15.638
Uh-uh-uh!

20:15.705 --> 20:17.205
Hey.

20:17.272 --> 20:19.272
Hey, what happened
to you?

20:19.339 --> 20:20.972
What are you talking about?

20:21.039 --> 20:22.805
I thought you went to Mom's.

20:22.872 --> 20:24.471
No.

20:24.538 --> 20:25.939
Then where were you?

20:26.005 --> 20:27.372
I don't remember.

20:27.438 --> 20:28.838
What do you mean,
you don't remember?

20:28.905 --> 20:31.306
It's called a repressed memory.

20:31.372 --> 20:32.471
Now drop it!

20:38.972 --> 20:42.905
Any one of you you lily-livered,
bowlegged varmints care

20:42.972 --> 20:45.172
to slap leather with me?!

20:45.239 --> 20:48.505
I'm the hootinest,
tootinest, shootinest

20:48.571 --> 20:50.672
bobtailed wildcat!

20:52.306 --> 20:57.172
I'm the fastest gun
north, south, east and west

20:57.239 --> 20:58.738
of the Pecos!
