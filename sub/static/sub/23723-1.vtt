01:18.930 --> 01:20.239
Hey, Rhona, any news?

01:20.240 --> 01:23.459
<i>Well,</i> if you've got plans
for the weekend, cancel them.

01:23.460 --> 01:25.369
Malone just won his appeal.

01:25.370 --> 01:27.919
<i>The advocate general wants
to reopen the Kilmuir case.</i>

01:27.920 --> 01:29.220
OK.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.370
It's over, Thomas.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.610
It's over.

01:54.360 --> 01:56.049
So,
come on,

01:56.050 --> 01:58.309
what do you want to do first?
A pint?

01:58.310 --> 02:00.990
No, I...
I just want to go home.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.639
<i>Thomas Malone.</i>

02:03.640 --> 02:07.809
<i>Convicted in 1994 for the
murder of Lizzie Kilmuir,</i>

02:07.810 --> 02:10.559
was released this morning
after he was acquitted

02:10.560 --> 02:12.610
at the High Court in Edinburgh.

02:13.160 --> 02:15.720
For those of you that don't know,

02:16.450 --> 02:19.610
Lizzie Kilmuir,
she was strangled,

02:19.960 --> 02:23.900
and her body was found
inside a kiln on Unst.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.559
Thomas Malone
confessed to the murder

02:28.560 --> 02:30.460
and was sentenced to life.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.979
The CCRC have
presented new evidence

02:34.980 --> 02:38.550
that was overlooked at the time
of the original trial.

02:39.400 --> 02:42.599
Secondary DNA
from the crime scene

02:42.600 --> 02:44.679
always pointed
to a second suspect,

02:44.680 --> 02:47.800
but it wasn't tested at the time.

02:49.440 --> 02:53.420
The insinuation from the review
commission is pretty clear --

02:54.000 --> 02:58.319
they think that this evidence
was withheld deliberately.

02:58.320 --> 03:00.179
I doubt it.
I've known Drew McCall,

03:00.180 --> 03:02.279
who was the SIO,
a long time --

03:02.280 --> 03:04.899
<i>- not his style.
- Well, whatever happened,</i>

03:04.900 --> 03:08.939
<i>the charges were dismissed,</i>
it's a mistrial,

03:08.940 --> 03:11.959
and it doesn't paint the force
in a particularly good light.

03:11.960 --> 03:15.480
I just got word -- Malone landed at
Sumburgh about 15 minutes ago.

03:23.320 --> 03:26.329
<i>I want everybody to drop whatever it
is that you're working on.</i>

03:26.330 --> 03:29.019
The Lizzie Kilmuir case is the
priority.

03:29.020 --> 03:32.039
I want to see if we
can get some closure for the family.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.359
Billy, look out all the files
that we've got

03:34.360 --> 03:35.819
on the Lizzie Kilmuir case.

03:35.820 --> 03:38.749
Tosh, get in touch with the CCRC,

03:38.750 --> 03:40.809
because we're going to need to see
everything that they've got --

03:40.810 --> 03:43.619
both evidential, non-evidential,
new statements,

03:43.620 --> 03:44.929
- whatever.
- Sure.

03:44.930 --> 03:47.089
And when we get those new
statements,

03:47.090 --> 03:48.850
I want everybody on them,

03:49.400 --> 03:52.570
because there is a second
suspect out there,

03:52.920 --> 03:54.760
somewhere.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.949
Sandy.

04:00.950 --> 04:02.500
Can I have a word?

04:04.160 --> 04:06.450
You knew Lizzie Kilmuir, right?

04:07.240 --> 04:08.850
I was at school with her.

04:09.760 --> 04:12.510
I'm still friends with her twin
sister, Kate.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.990
- It's not a problem.
- I didn't say it was.

04:22.570 --> 04:24.009
You all right, Sally?

04:24.010 --> 04:25.709
I'm fine, Allan.

04:25.710 --> 04:27.259
Right, OK,
I'm just asking.

04:27.260 --> 04:29.280
You asked me three times in the car.

04:30.410 --> 04:32.480
Just leave it.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.210
You got the tickets, then, Jo?

04:36.560 --> 04:38.019
For God's sake,
Allan,

04:38.020 --> 04:39.779
you've got the attention
span of a midge.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.350
You need to look at her.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.710
Sorry, Jo, tickets?

04:45.440 --> 04:48.719
- No worries, I've got them.
- Much do I owe you?

04:48.720 --> 04:51.679
- Oh, thank you.
- Here, open that, will you?

04:51.680 --> 04:53.759
Starting early, then?

04:53.760 --> 04:55.060
OK.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.630
- Sure you don't want one?
- No, no, I'm fine.

05:19.640 --> 05:22.399
Really, I just wanted to touch
base about the Kilmuir case.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.199
No problem, Jimmy.
Just doing your job.

05:25.200 --> 05:29.269
This unknown DNA
comes from a hair

05:29.270 --> 05:32.099
on a scarf found
round Lizzie's neck

05:32.100 --> 05:33.790
and thought to be
the murder weapon.

05:34.480 --> 05:36.109
So why didn't I
test it back then?

05:36.110 --> 05:37.569
That's your next question,
isn't it?

05:37.570 --> 05:38.929
- Yeah.
- Well,

05:38.930 --> 05:40.889
I didn't think it would
yield enough DNA.

05:40.890 --> 05:44.190
And you had your man, so
why complicate matters?

05:44.640 --> 05:47.220
No, not quite.

05:47.880 --> 05:51.619
We risked destroying potential
evidence, it wasn't worth it.

05:51.620 --> 05:53.349
Best wait till techniques

05:53.350 --> 05:56.279
advanced enough to get
a proper profile.

05:56.280 --> 05:59.450
The defence was informed
of its existence.

06:00.080 --> 06:03.450
They overlooked it. I did explain
that to the CCRC.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.750
Kate!
Kate!

06:08.260 --> 06:10.009
- Hello.
- Hi, Molly.

06:10.010 --> 06:12.039
- Hi.
- Enjoying the bounce?

06:12.040 --> 06:13.919
It's not exactly Glastonbury, is it?

06:13.920 --> 06:15.799
Well, at least it's no' raining.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.409
- Can I have a word in private?
- We heard on the radio

06:18.410 --> 06:20.499
- that Malone was released.
- Kate, I'm sorry.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.499
You've nothing
to be sorry about.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.559
We're reopening the case.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.959
As you're Lizzie's only family left,

06:26.960 --> 06:29.759
we'll be in touch. I just wanted you
to hear it from me.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.069
OK.

06:31.070 --> 06:32.889
So how have you been anyway?

06:32.890 --> 06:36.039
I've not seen much of you
since you and Jenny split.

06:36.040 --> 06:37.920
- I'm fine. - Yeah.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.570
Missing the kids, I must admit,
but...

06:41.920 --> 06:43.960
.. it was for the best.

06:45.240 --> 06:46.960
Can I get you a drink?

06:48.520 --> 06:50.199
I could have one.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.029
- Aye? Do you want a Coke?
- Vodka -

06:52.030 --> 06:54.119
No, lass, a Coke.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.710
Right, I'm done.
I need another. You coming?

06:57.550 --> 06:59.679
Aye, all right.
Do you want a drink?

06:59.680 --> 07:01.460
- Yeah, sure.
- Cool.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.809
Why did you go after Malone in the
first place?

07:15.810 --> 07:18.059
Cried like a baby
at Lizzie's funeral.

07:18.060 --> 07:21.479
It was odd.
He was odd.

07:21.480 --> 07:22.989
So I asked about.

07:22.990 --> 07:25.359
Turned out he was fixated on her.

07:25.360 --> 07:28.179
Then a witness came forward
putting him on the Unst ferry

07:28.180 --> 07:30.199
the day Lizzie went missing.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.319
So we searched his house,

07:32.320 --> 07:34.609
found chickweed on his shoes.

07:34.610 --> 07:36.739
Edmondson's mousehair
only grows on Unst.

07:36.740 --> 07:39.150
We had him. It was done
and dusted, he confessed.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.139
They all recounted.

07:41.140 --> 07:42.759
Aye, well, people do.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.640
One lie after another.

07:45.440 --> 07:47.050
It was a strong case.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.659
All the court has done is
put his conviction in doubt,

07:50.660 --> 07:52.419
nobody said he was innocent.

07:52.420 --> 07:54.190
He did it, Jimmy.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.380
I swear on my wife's grave.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.380
Sally!

08:52.880 --> 08:54.389
Here's the search videos,

08:54.390 --> 08:56.490
crime scene photos,
witness statements.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.719
And that's only one box.

08:58.720 --> 09:02.420
There's dozens of them down there,
stacks of unused material.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.399
What was Drew McCall
like to work with?

09:09.400 --> 09:10.929
Aye, he's a good man.

09:10.930 --> 09:13.539
He took early retirement
when his wife died.

09:13.540 --> 09:15.280
It's just him and Sally now.

10:46.320 --> 10:49.369
<i>TAPE: Interview with Thomas Malone
commencing at 9:15pm,</i>

10:49.370 --> 10:52.449
<i>conducted by DI McCall
and DS Donovan.</i>

10:52.450 --> 10:54.720
<i>OK, Thomas.
This your last chance.</i>

10:55.320 --> 10:57.029
<i>You need to stop lying.</i>

10:57.030 --> 11:00.039
<i>You need to tell the truth
for the sake of the Kilmuir family,</i>

11:00.040 --> 11:01.340
<i>you understand?</i>

11:02.750 --> 11:06.439
<i>We have a witness who saw you,
Thomas, on the ferry.</i>

11:06.440 --> 11:09.639
<i>Benny Ray.
Or is Benny lying?</i>

11:09.640 --> 11:11.490
<i>Is everybody a liar except you?</i>

11:12.240 --> 11:14.650
<i>I heard she was a bit of a cock
tease.</i>

11:15.280 --> 11:18.679
<i>Did she take the mickey out of you?
Is that what happened?</i>

11:18.680 --> 11:21.299
<i>Wouldn't blame you for getting
angry. Nobody would.</i>

11:21.300 --> 11:24.099
<i>If you admit it, Thomas, it'll
mean a shorter sentence.</i>

11:24.100 --> 11:25.409
<i>Trust me.</i>

11:25.410 --> 11:28.219
<i>You keep saying you didn't do it
and they'll throw away the key.</i>

11:28.220 --> 11:30.970
<i>Are you listening, son?
You're going to die in prison.</i>

11:35.520 --> 11:38.959
<i>And your mother, think about her.
What would this do to her?</i>

11:38.960 --> 11:40.770
<i>She's not in the best of health,
is she?</i>

11:41.520 --> 11:44.229
<i>A long, drawn-out court
case would be the end of her.</i>

11:44.230 --> 11:46.669
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no...</i>

11:46.670 --> 11:49.570
<i>For the record, Mr. Malone is
shaking his head and crying.</i>

11:50.120 --> 11:52.780
<i>Interview paused at 10:45pm.</i>

12:17.280 --> 12:19.719
<i>Interview resumed at 11:23pm.</i>

12:19.720 --> 12:21.879
<i>Now, Thomas,
let's get this straight.</i>

12:21.880 --> 12:25.160
<i>Did you kill Lizzie Kilmuir?</i>

12:27.760 --> 12:29.970
<i>Did you kill Lizzie Kilmuir?</i>

12:31.590 --> 12:34.119
<i>Yeah, I did.
Aye, I did.</i>

12:34.120 --> 12:37.250
<i>You did?
You did what?</i>

12:39.840 --> 12:42.800
<i>I did,
I killed Lizzie Kilmuir.</i>

12:44.080 --> 12:46.160
<i>How did you do that?</i>

12:47.680 --> 12:49.650
<i>I strangled her.</i>

12:54.640 --> 12:55.940
<i> Why?</i>

12:56.350 --> 12:58.019
Why?
Because...

12:58.020 --> 13:00.809
<i>because she went out
with other people, right?</i>

13:00.810 --> 13:04.059
<i>And not me.</i>
"What happenned in the pause?"

13:04.060 --> 13:08.920
<i>Because she went out with other
people and not me!</i>

13:11.640 --> 13:13.580
What are you still doing here?

13:15.680 --> 13:16.989
You can go.

13:16.990 --> 13:19.340
Not expecting you
to do an all-nighter.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.350
I'm good, thanks.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.789
I thought you'd have
been at the festival.

13:26.790 --> 13:29.569
The thrill of trying to pee whilst
hovering over a chemical toilet

13:29.570 --> 13:32.750
doesn't hold the same allure as it
once did.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.720
Sure.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.490
Any word of your transfer?

13:46.560 --> 13:49.050
Seems to be dragging
on a wee bit.

13:49.360 --> 13:52.560
I... I got an offer
of a placement in Edinburgh.

13:53.270 --> 13:55.519
I haven't decided what to do yet.

13:55.520 --> 13:57.479
You do know that I don't
want you to go, right?

13:57.480 --> 13:59.189
I mean,
if it was up to me,

13:59.190 --> 14:01.890
I'd have you tagged
so you couldn't leave.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.700
If you ever want to talk, I'm here.

14:26.760 --> 14:29.559
<i>Hi, this is Gail Callaghan,
Life After Appeal.</i>

14:29.560 --> 14:31.229
<i>- Just leave your message...</i>
- Come on!

14:31.230 --> 14:33.059
<i>.. and I'll get back to you.
Thanks a lot, bye.</i>

14:33.060 --> 14:35.310
Gail.
Gail, it's me.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.560
I... I...
need to speak to you.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.540
I should never have come back here.

14:52.780 --> 14:55.959
I can't...
I just couldn't do it.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.510
I can't do this.
I can't.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.100
Gail.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.489
- Hi, Drew.
- Hi, Jo, is Sally there?

15:30.490 --> 15:33.449
I'm supposed to have breakfast
with her
and can't get her on her mobile.

15:33.450 --> 15:35.720
<i>I don't know.</i>
I'll just go and check.

15:40.690 --> 15:43.199
<i>She's not here, Drew.
Maybe she's down at Alan's.</i>

15:43.200 --> 15:44.500
Tried him already.

15:56.800 --> 15:59.679
We have a problem.
Drew McColl called in.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.139
His daughter seems
to be missing.

16:01.140 --> 16:03.859
Flatmate says she didn't come home
from the festival last night.

16:03.860 --> 16:06.069
she didn't turn up for work
at the Chronicle,

16:06.070 --> 16:08.470
and her boyfriend
says she didn't stay with him.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.729
Check A&E and see if
she's had an accident,

16:12.730 --> 16:14.280
and hopefully she'll be fine.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.639
But treat her
as a vulnerable person,

16:16.640 --> 16:18.609
and see if you can
track her phone.

16:18.610 --> 16:19.910
OK.

16:38.120 --> 16:41.490
Can't really see this place going a
bomb on Airbnb, can you?

16:45.400 --> 16:47.539
You should probably know
that we're going to reopen

16:47.540 --> 16:49.010
the Lizzie Kilmuir case,

16:49.820 --> 16:52.930
so I was wondering if you'd
like to talk to us about it.

16:53.940 --> 16:56.400
Aye, well,
last time I did that...

16:57.740 --> 16:59.990
.. it didnae work out
too well for me.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.220
Don't you want to find the man
who killed Lizzie?

17:07.319 --> 17:08.720
You know...

17:09.880 --> 17:12.750
I walked out of that prison
yesterday...

17:14.200 --> 17:15.720
.. with nothing.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.319
And the best part of my life is
gone.

17:19.319 --> 17:20.810
If I had been guilty,

17:22.020 --> 17:25.190
I would have got a liberation
grant of...

17:25.680 --> 17:27.780
.. 78 quid.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.800
That works out about...

17:34.500 --> 17:36.700
three quid a year.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.539
But I was innocent,

17:39.540 --> 17:41.069
so there's no support,

17:41.070 --> 17:43.300
no benefits,
no fuck all.

17:43.880 --> 17:47.580
But, aye, I do, I do want to find
the man that killed Lizzie.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.560
I just don't think you do.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.880
If we can find this other suspect,
it can only help you.

18:00.600 --> 18:03.940
Really?
How's that?

18:06.570 --> 18:08.590
I mean, look at me.

18:09.540 --> 18:10.840
Look at me!

18:12.080 --> 18:14.000
How are you going to help me?

18:15.680 --> 18:18.290
If anybody gives you
any bother at all...

18:20.200 --> 18:24.080
.. then give me a call.
That's my mobile number.

18:39.970 --> 18:42.979
- What are you doing here?
- I'm Detective Inspector Perez.

18:42.980 --> 18:45.080
- This is...
- I worked that out. What do you want?

18:46.120 --> 18:48.379
- Are you a relative?
- Gail Callaghan,

18:48.380 --> 18:49.989
I work for Life After Appeal.

18:49.990 --> 18:51.919
We help people like
Thomas to adjust to life

18:51.920 --> 18:53.739
outside of prison,
which is more than you lot do.

18:53.740 --> 18:55.879
I know what you do, you've got
nothing to worry about.

18:55.880 --> 18:58.599
You do know his blood pressure's
sky-high? That he's got a heart condition?

18:58.600 --> 19:01.200
- This was just a courtesy call.
- No apology, though, eh?

19:02.440 --> 19:05.860
We're claiming compensation for
a malicious conviction,

19:06.770 --> 19:08.300
just so you know.

19:10.760 --> 19:13.429
Wouldn't want to get on the wrong
side of her, would you?

19:13.430 --> 19:14.920
I think we just did.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.669
- Billy.
<i>- I just got a report</i>

19:19.670 --> 19:21.869
of a body being found
out at Fladdabister...

19:21.870 --> 19:24.000
<i>.. inside an old lime kiln.</i>

19:25.080 --> 19:28.640
Send forensics up there
as soon as. We're on our way.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.720
Did you know Sally?
Would you recognise her?

19:48.540 --> 19:51.080
- Yeah. - Christ!

20:25.640 --> 20:27.549
<i>She was at the
folk festival last night,</i>

20:27.550 --> 20:29.739
<i>and her car is still
in the car park.</i>

20:29.740 --> 20:32.949
I checked with the minicab company
and they don't have a booking
in her name.

20:32.950 --> 20:34.619
How'd she get up here?

20:34.620 --> 20:36.260
There's no sign of a phone.

20:37.720 --> 20:39.289
How did you get on, Cora?

20:39.290 --> 20:41.880
She's been there
about 10 to 12 hours.

20:43.280 --> 20:46.919
My first stab at cause
of death is strangulation.

20:46.920 --> 20:49.579
Bruising to the head and lack
of defensive wounds suggest she

20:49.580 --> 20:52.319
may have been knocked
unconscious first.

20:52.320 --> 20:54.659
I can't say more, Jimmy,
until we do the autopsy.

20:54.660 --> 20:55.960
OK.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.080
I remember giving that girl
her measles jab.

21:01.320 --> 21:03.280
Tough as old boots she was.

21:07.240 --> 21:09.699
Malone was at the festival.
We saw him.

21:09.700 --> 21:11.419
Well, don't jump the gun,
Sandy.

21:11.420 --> 21:13.559
Lots of people were
at the festival.

21:13.560 --> 21:16.179
Go and speak to the flatmate,
see what you can get.

21:16.180 --> 21:18.580
I better go and break
the news to Drew McCall.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.639
Gail, I don't think this
is a good idea.

21:23.640 --> 21:25.239
I mean, what am I supposed to say?

21:25.240 --> 21:27.169
If you want to be accepted,
Thomas,

21:27.170 --> 21:29.479
people need to hear
your side of it.

21:29.480 --> 21:32.640
And it will help your
compensation case, trust me.

21:35.280 --> 21:37.920
Just be yourself.

21:40.080 --> 21:43.239
<i>And now we have an unusual
segment on the show.</i>

21:43.240 --> 21:45.419
<i>Thomas Malone is with us.</i>

21:45.420 --> 21:48.479
Now, many of you will know Mr. Malone
has been freed from prison

21:48.480 --> 21:50.959
after serving 23 years.

21:50.960 --> 21:55.159
Well, he's agreed to come here today
and to tell us a little bit

21:55.160 --> 21:56.989
about Life After Appeal,

21:56.990 --> 22:00.359
the organisation helping
people in his situation.

22:00.360 --> 22:01.839
Now then, Thomas,

22:01.840 --> 22:03.899
<i>how did it feel to be a free man?</i>

22:03.900 --> 22:05.200
<i>I don't know.</i>

22:05.800 --> 22:09.359
<i>I'm not used to it yet.
It takes time, I suppose.</i>

22:09.360 --> 22:12.379
<i>Well, I'm sure it does.
Now, a lot has changed.</i>

22:12.380 --> 22:16.499
<i>Now, when you went to prison,
Bill Clinton was president</i>

22:16.500 --> 22:19.539
and a pint of milk was 49p.

22:19.540 --> 22:22.900
How are you coping with all
this new technology?

22:23.600 --> 22:26.679
<i>I'm not.
The big thing for me is the fact</i>

22:26.680 --> 22:29.249
<i>that my mother isn't around.</i>

22:29.250 --> 22:31.810
<i>She passed away when
I was in prison.</i>

22:32.560 --> 22:34.519
That must have been difficult.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.039
I was refused permission
to go to her funeral.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.609
If I'd admitted my guilt,

22:38.610 --> 22:40.619
<i>I might have gotten
out before she died.</i>

22:40.620 --> 22:43.959
<i>But if you claim you're innocent
you might as well forget it.</i>

22:43.960 --> 22:45.679
You'll never get parole.

22:45.680 --> 22:46.989
<i>Why was that?</i>

22:46.990 --> 22:48.919
<i>They think you're in denial.</i>

22:48.920 --> 22:51.869
<i>Well, that must </i> eat away
at you, surely.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.989
And even now, this...

22:54.990 --> 22:58.159
idea that you got off
on a technicality.

22:58.160 --> 23:00.259
No, not really.

23:00.260 --> 23:02.450
The police buried evidence.

23:04.120 --> 23:07.530
Evidence that might have made
the jury think twice.

23:08.280 --> 23:10.039
Sure, but,

23:10.040 --> 23:12.379
I mean,
in some people's minds

23:12.380 --> 23:16.629
there is still this suspicion that
you really might have done it.

23:16.630 --> 23:18.300
How do you deal with that?

23:21.010 --> 23:22.319
I didn't do it.

23:22.320 --> 23:25.519
<i>Well, would you say you
were the</i> same young man

23:25.520 --> 23:28.139
- who went to jail 22 years ago? - No.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.039
No, prison changes you.

23:30.040 --> 23:33.649
<i>I know how low people will sink</i>

23:33.650 --> 23:36.789
and how cruel
and heartless they can be.

23:36.790 --> 23:39.089
<i>You have to be like that to survive.</i>

23:39.090 --> 23:42.479
<i>Well, that is a pretty bleak</i>
view of the world.

23:42.480 --> 23:46.079
But I suppose it's understandable
in your circumstances.

23:46.080 --> 23:49.759
Now, it appears we have
a caller on the line.

23:49.760 --> 23:51.470
Kate Kilmuir.

23:52.800 --> 23:54.509
Now,
that name will be familiar

23:54.510 --> 23:56.519
to anyone who has
read about this case,

23:56.520 --> 24:01.099
but to those of you who haven't,
I believe she is the twin sister

24:01.100 --> 24:02.880
of your alleged victim.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.799
- Is that right?
- Aye.

24:05.800 --> 24:09.829
Well, let's hear
what she has to say.

24:09.830 --> 24:13.799
Kate, <i>you're live on air.
Hell</i> o.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.450
<i>What would you like to say
to Thomas Malone?</i>

24:19.920 --> 24:21.750
Hello, Kate,
are you still there?

24:23.080 --> 24:24.719
<i>Yes.</i>

24:24.720 --> 24:27.490
What would you like to say to
<i>Thomas Malone?</i>

24:28.760 --> 24:30.350
Just one thing.

24:36.080 --> 24:37.599
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

24:37.600 --> 24:39.910
What, "I'm sorry,"
<i>is that what you said?</i>

24:40.220 --> 24:45.139
<i>Thomas Malone is as much a victim
of this crime as my sister was.</i>

24:45.140 --> 24:47.020
And I am sorry

24:48.130 --> 24:50.450
that his life was
taken away from him.

24:55.480 --> 24:59.699
<i>Right. Well, yes,
that is interesting.</i>

24:59.700 --> 25:01.589
<i>Kate,</i>

25:01.590 --> 25:04.770
is there anything else you
would like to say to Thomas?

25:05.520 --> 25:07.990
Kate?
Are you still there?

25:10.360 --> 25:12.760
<i>Well, thank you,
Thomas,</i>

25:13.070 --> 25:15.539
<i>for being so honest.</i>

25:15.540 --> 25:17.219
<i>It's been fascinating.</i>

25:17.220 --> 25:18.520
<i>Now...</i>

25:22.960 --> 25:24.430
Where did you find her?

25:25.080 --> 25:29.300
Fladdabister, inside a lime kiln.

25:34.760 --> 25:37.439
How did she die?

25:37.440 --> 25:39.349
We don't need to go into
that right now.

25:39.350 --> 25:41.209
- Really, we don't.
- How did she die, Jimmy?

25:41.210 --> 25:42.510
Just tell me.

25:46.800 --> 25:49.870
We're still waiting
for the pathologist's report.

25:50.920 --> 25:53.250
But it looks like
she was strangled.

25:59.040 --> 26:01.509
- Bastard.
- We don't know who did this.

26:01.510 --> 26:03.990
Bastard.

26:05.840 --> 26:08.680
Bastard. Bastard.

26:10.320 --> 26:14.089
We both know this is revenge,
pure and fucking simple.

26:14.090 --> 26:15.949
Look, he's the first person
that we're going to be looking at,

26:15.950 --> 26:18.300
- you can be sure of that.
- Just go and get him.

26:19.460 --> 26:21.120
Go and get the bastard.

26:36.800 --> 26:39.600
"I'm on the 2:30 flight
Cassie. X"

26:44.800 --> 26:46.459
Why did you say that?

26:46.460 --> 26:48.549
You said you feel sorry for him.

26:48.550 --> 26:49.959
He killed Aunt Lizzie.

26:49.960 --> 26:52.159
Now,
we never knew that was true.

26:52.160 --> 26:54.559
And the police, they're not
right all the time.

26:54.560 --> 26:56.259
Have you always thought that?

26:56.260 --> 26:58.259
I don't know what to think.

26:58.260 --> 26:59.949
It's complicated.

26:59.950 --> 27:01.959
You didn't know him
when he was younger.

27:01.960 --> 27:05.259
He was quiet and he was
kind to us.

27:05.260 --> 27:08.159
I can't believe you.
Nobody believes him.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.460
Nobody!

27:15.380 --> 27:17.199
She won't hear you. She's deaf.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.959
I just sent her a text.

27:18.960 --> 27:20.919
- You've been here before?
- A few times.

27:20.920 --> 27:22.660
Prowlers, apparently.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.219
DS McIntosh.

27:31.220 --> 27:32.700
Can we have a word?

27:36.560 --> 27:40.080
I just can't believe she's gone,
that someone would do this to her.

27:41.280 --> 27:42.659
If you don't mind,

27:42.660 --> 27:45.900
can you tell us what you
remember about last night?

27:50.360 --> 27:54.239
I didn't want her driving,
took her keys off her.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.849
She was going to get a cab
home later.

27:56.850 --> 27:58.150
And you?

27:58.720 --> 28:01.999
Alan and I got a cab home together,
I dropped him in town,

28:02.000 --> 28:03.830
he wanted to get something to eat.

28:04.880 --> 28:08.279
How long have you two
been sharing this place?

28:08.280 --> 28:10.990
Not long.
She just moved in.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.269
Did you notice anything

28:14.270 --> 28:17.270
out of the ordinary happen
at the festival?

28:19.400 --> 28:21.719
Not really.
They had an argument

28:21.720 --> 28:24.309
about Sally getting pished,
but that was all.

28:24.310 --> 28:26.580
- Alan and Sally?
- That's right.

28:28.320 --> 28:31.610
Then I saw her talking
to this young guy,

28:32.120 --> 28:35.039
I didn't get a good look at him.
He had his hood up.

28:35.040 --> 28:37.519
I'm pretty sure they weren't
speaking English.

28:37.520 --> 28:40.459
- What were they speaking?
- Norwegian, I think.

28:40.460 --> 28:41.769
Sally speaks a bit.

28:41.770 --> 28:44.979
She covers all the Norwegian
stories for the paper.

28:44.980 --> 28:47.689
We'll need her keys,
to search her car.

28:47.690 --> 28:49.690
They're hanging by the front door.

28:53.080 --> 28:54.479
Did something happened to you?

28:54.480 --> 28:56.990
It's just,
I noticed all the locks.

28:59.360 --> 29:03.590
I was in an abusive relationship.

29:04.720 --> 29:06.679
That's why I came up here.

29:06.680 --> 29:08.860
To get away from him.

29:13.340 --> 29:16.239
You were at the music festival,
is that right?

29:16.240 --> 29:17.969
I never planned to go.

29:17.970 --> 29:21.579
I just went for a walk
and found myself there.

29:21.580 --> 29:24.830
So you didn't go looking
for anybody in particular, then?

29:25.680 --> 29:28.559
I don't know Sally McCall.

29:28.560 --> 29:31.549
Thomas, the daughter of the
policeman that put you in prison

29:31.550 --> 29:33.030
has been found dead.

29:33.540 --> 29:36.859
You want me to help you, you're going
to have to start telling me the truth.

29:36.860 --> 29:38.989
I couldn't even tell you what
the girl looks like.

29:38.990 --> 29:40.959
He's telling the truth.
He was on the phone to me

29:40.960 --> 29:42.519
most of last night.

29:42.520 --> 29:45.399
I don't think you should answer any more
questions without a lawyer present, Thomas.

29:45.400 --> 29:48.200
- You cannae trust these people.
- Well, he can trust me...

29:48.720 --> 29:50.650
.. if he's telling the truth.

29:52.840 --> 29:54.450
See if you're not,

29:55.260 --> 29:57.760
you're going to wish you'd
never set eyes on me.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.000
The boot's been jemmied.

30:25.480 --> 30:26.799
You got anything?

30:26.800 --> 30:28.720
No sign of a struggle.

30:30.680 --> 30:32.559
Nothing except a...

30:32.560 --> 30:34.479
.. used boarding pass,

30:34.480 --> 30:37.079
for a flight to Bergen.
It's dated last week.

30:37.080 --> 30:39.469
Right, get forensics up here.
I'll check The Chronicle.

30:39.470 --> 30:40.770
Sure.

30:43.050 --> 30:46.009
The only girl I know
with dads on group text.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.039
You have any idea
what's going on?

30:48.040 --> 30:49.349
No.

30:49.350 --> 30:51.160
You don't think
she's pregnant, do you?

30:53.120 --> 30:54.650
Well, I do now.

31:03.680 --> 31:05.189
<i>Is there anything you know</i>

31:05.190 --> 31:07.019
that might shed some light
on what happened?

31:07.020 --> 31:09.599
No.
Well, not really, no.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.559
Sally worked 24/7.

31:11.560 --> 31:13.650
She was a real grafter,
you know?

31:14.050 --> 31:17.930
She's saw herself as a
campaigning journalist.

31:18.680 --> 31:22.130
Had she had any contact
with Thomas Malone?

31:23.080 --> 31:24.479
Not that I'm aware, no.

31:24.480 --> 31:27.739
She was working on an article
on her dad's career

31:27.740 --> 31:30.859
to coincide
with Malone's appeal.

31:30.860 --> 31:33.959
She probably just wanted to put
his side of the story.

31:33.960 --> 31:37.840
And she did our Norway View
column as well.

31:38.520 --> 31:40.299
Forst Energy?

31:40.300 --> 31:42.699
Aye, some angle she had

31:42.700 --> 31:45.850
on an accident on one
of the Norwegian oil fields.

31:46.600 --> 31:47.999
Who's AH?

31:48.000 --> 31:49.690
I don't know.
Maybe a source.

31:50.320 --> 31:52.570
Can I have a look at her laptop?

31:52.920 --> 31:55.000
She always took that home.

31:58.280 --> 31:59.920
<i>You want to tell me what happened?</i>

32:01.200 --> 32:02.890
He met someone else.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.950
Are you really going to ignore that?

32:09.520 --> 32:12.240
I can't.
Not for long.

32:13.480 --> 32:16.150
They found a
body out at Fladdabister.

32:18.240 --> 32:21.080
Don't worry.
Just drop me off.

32:22.520 --> 32:23.829
OK.

32:23.830 --> 32:26.750
But tonight, right?
We can have dinner.

32:27.400 --> 32:29.120
And then we can talk.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.879
We can't find her laptop.

33:08.880 --> 33:10.639
It wasn't in her croft
or the car,

33:10.640 --> 33:12.649
and we know she took it
home every night.

33:12.650 --> 33:13.959
And what about this place?

33:13.960 --> 33:16.559
Billy checked all the hotels
for AH, no luck.

33:16.560 --> 33:19.449
But one name jumped
out -- Jan Hansen.

33:19.450 --> 33:21.659
It's the Norwegian
equivalent of John Smith.

33:21.660 --> 33:22.960
- Right.
- It could be fake.

33:24.320 --> 33:26.559
So who do you think this AH is?

33:26.560 --> 33:29.900
Sally's boss thinks it might have
been someone she was investigating.

33:32.760 --> 33:37.399
Anything strike you about this guy
Hansen, anything different?

33:37.400 --> 33:39.339
Only that he paid in cash,

33:39.340 --> 33:41.110
which is rare these days.

33:42.400 --> 33:44.729
Do you think you'd recognise
him if you seen him again?

33:44.730 --> 33:46.039
I doubt it.

33:46.040 --> 33:47.850
I'm not even sure what age he'd be.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.730
There's a ticket stub
for the festival.

33:58.400 --> 34:00.980
Can we see your CCTV, please?

34:06.800 --> 34:09.498
See if the chemical in the
hands print lab can get

34:09.500 --> 34:12.270
any prints off of that
ticket stub, will you?

34:36.120 --> 34:40.080
Jo Halley says that she saw you
and Sally having an argument.

34:41.920 --> 34:44.800
I thought she was drinking
too much and she...

34:45.400 --> 34:47.409
.. was pissed off with me.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.559
Jo also mentioned that she saw
Sally talking to some Norwegian.

34:53.560 --> 34:56.120
Do you have any idea
who that might have been?

34:57.840 --> 34:59.440
Not really.

35:00.960 --> 35:03.119
So not a mutual friend, then?

35:03.120 --> 35:04.579
To be honest with you,
she...

35:04.580 --> 35:06.900
had been acting pretty
secretive recently.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.779
Deleting texts on her phone.

35:10.780 --> 35:12.319
Well, you start to think
the worst, don't you,

35:12.320 --> 35:14.959
when someone's holding back?
I...

35:14.960 --> 35:16.530
.. thought that she'd

35:17.340 --> 35:20.590
met someone in
Bergen so I did...

35:21.680 --> 35:25.000
.. the smart thing,
I accused her, and she just...

35:27.280 --> 35:30.110
.. looked at me disgusted
that I'd even asked.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.479
So did you not believe her?

35:34.480 --> 35:36.559
I didn't know what to believe.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.400
I thought I was losing her.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.329
It's a terrible waste.
She was so bright.

35:43.330 --> 35:45.269
She wasn't scared to poke fires.

35:45.270 --> 35:47.259
I don't think she would have stayed
in Shetland much longer.

35:47.260 --> 35:49.119
Well, she never mentioned anything
about leaving.

35:49.120 --> 35:51.400
I just...
.. mean that she was...

35:51.990 --> 35:54.000
.. talented and ambitious.

35:56.240 --> 35:59.700
Do you remember seeing Sally with
anybody else at the festival?

36:01.080 --> 36:03.000
Thomas Malone, for instance.

36:05.320 --> 36:06.620
No.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.190
I left.

36:11.140 --> 36:12.740
I left her.

36:14.040 --> 36:16.000
He got back here about 11:00.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.160
OK.

36:29.040 --> 36:32.319
<i>The boyfriend suspected that Sally
was having an affair,</i>

36:32.320 --> 36:34.119
<i>possibly with this Norwegian.</i>

36:34.120 --> 36:35.959
What about Malone?
Did he see him?

36:35.960 --> 36:39.280
Why would Malone jeopardise
his freedom in that way?

36:40.680 --> 36:43.559
Why did he confess to killing Lizzie
and then change his mind?

36:43.560 --> 36:45.309
- Why does he do anything?
- OK,

36:45.310 --> 36:48.439
Sally's mobile phone
and laptop are missing.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.919
That might have something
to do with this article

36:50.920 --> 36:53.499
that she was writing -- check
if there was a Jan Hansen

36:53.500 --> 36:55.339
in any flights in and out.

36:55.340 --> 36:58.239
- Are we saying this guy is our main suspect?
-No, I didn't say that.

36:58.240 --> 37:00.309
Cos he wouldn't have been
the only Norwegian at the festival.

37:00.310 --> 37:03.039
No, but he would have been the only
one trying to make himself invisible.

37:03.040 --> 37:06.759
So, get a list of all the
Norwegian nationals living here

37:06.760 --> 37:09.990
and run a check on the number...

37:11.520 --> 37:13.459
I want to know why Malone

37:13.460 --> 37:15.469
isn't in one of your fuckin'
cells right now!

37:15.470 --> 37:17.169
He thinks he's untouchable.

37:17.170 --> 37:19.499
He knows you're too scared
to arrest him again.

37:19.500 --> 37:22.109
He did it then,
and he's done it again!

37:22.110 --> 37:24.059
He's laughing at us, Jimmy!

37:24.060 --> 37:26.080
He's laughing at all of us!

37:30.780 --> 37:33.640
Come on, come with me.

37:35.040 --> 37:37.960
We'll go and find somewhere
quiet to talk. Come on.

38:55.440 --> 38:58.650
<i>Hi, this is Cassie Perez,
please leave a message.</i>

38:59.200 --> 39:01.849
<i>Hey, Cassie, probably
not going to be home till late,</i>

39:01.850 --> 39:04.500
<i>but if you're still up,
we could talk then.</i>

39:05.360 --> 39:08.450
I... I love you.
I'll see you later. Bye.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.450
Is Cassie OK?

39:14.320 --> 39:16.320
No, I don't think so.

39:17.800 --> 39:19.279
What have you got?

39:19.280 --> 39:22.119
The number on the post-it
from The Chronicle

39:22.120 --> 39:25.039
was a mobile
registered to an Andreas Hagan.

39:25.040 --> 39:27.950
He's a health and safety officer
at Forst Energy.

39:29.320 --> 39:31.089
Were they in the news recently?

39:31.090 --> 39:32.949
Yeah. There was an accident
on one of their rigs.

39:32.950 --> 39:34.499
A Shetland man was killed --

39:34.500 --> 39:37.439
and there's been claims
of negligence
on the part of the company.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.259
If that's what Sally
was working on

39:39.260 --> 39:41.399
it would explain why
she was being so shifty.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.409
OK. Go and talk to
the dead man's family

39:43.410 --> 39:45.270
and see if Sally has been in touch.

39:51.960 --> 39:53.850
How's Drew?

39:57.080 --> 39:59.099
I don't know how he'll
ever get over this.

39:59.100 --> 40:01.559
I really don't...
and he's got a point, you know.

40:01.560 --> 40:04.419
We are on dangerous ground
with Malone at liberty.

40:04.420 --> 40:07.479
The only reason that we are looking
at him for Sally

40:07.480 --> 40:08.839
is because of Lizzie --

40:08.840 --> 40:10.999
and I'm not convinced
he killed Lizzie.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.459
There's some pretty damning
evidence against Malone --

40:13.460 --> 40:15.219
and he confessed, remember?

40:15.220 --> 40:17.359
Maybe I don't buy the confession.

40:17.360 --> 40:21.689
He denied it, there was a break,
THEN he admitted it.

40:21.690 --> 40:24.499
I would just like to know
what happened

40:24.500 --> 40:28.639
between those two interviews
to make him change his mind --

40:28.640 --> 40:30.360
because something did.

40:31.920 --> 40:35.050
Danny was a roughneck
in the Norwegian sector.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.309
Before he was killed he told me

40:41.310 --> 40:43.319
that the company
were cutting corners,

40:43.320 --> 40:45.119
safety regulations
being ignored.

40:45.120 --> 40:48.449
- In what way, exactly?
- Equipment not being maintained properly.

40:48.450 --> 40:50.919
We were told he was
working on the drilling deck

40:50.920 --> 40:53.690
when his arm got
snagged in the drive shaft.

40:54.080 --> 40:56.299
They spin 800 times a minute.

40:56.300 --> 40:58.079
Tore his arm clean off.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.380
He bled to death.

41:00.640 --> 41:02.429
And since the moment it happened,

41:02.430 --> 41:04.949
Forst Energy have been trying
to blame Danny

41:04.950 --> 41:06.419
so they don't have to pay out.

41:06.420 --> 41:08.799
They say he'd been drinking.

41:08.800 --> 41:12.299
They've got blood tests and everything
-- but it's a barefaced lie.

41:12.300 --> 41:14.719
And you spoke to
Sally McColl about this?

41:14.720 --> 41:17.749
I told her I knew for a fact
there wasn't a guard
on that drive shaft.

41:17.750 --> 41:20.800
Danny told me he'd
complained about it loads of times.

41:21.400 --> 41:23.959
What about the name Andreas Hagan?

41:23.960 --> 41:25.779
Does that mean anything to you?

41:25.780 --> 41:27.839
Mean anything?!

41:27.840 --> 41:29.679
Hagan wrote the report.

41:29.680 --> 41:32.080
He's the one saying that
Danny was drunk.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.379
<i>What's all this?</i>

41:36.380 --> 41:37.950
Tag team dads.

41:38.650 --> 41:40.419
Jimmy said he'd
given you a dizzy,

41:40.420 --> 41:41.970
so I'm filling in.

41:43.440 --> 41:44.940
You have to eat!

41:46.720 --> 41:48.760
And quickly, it would appear.

41:54.000 --> 41:58.750
This boy of yours, you do know
he's got no taste, don't you?

41:59.120 --> 42:01.159
You haven't seen his new girlfriend.

42:01.160 --> 42:05.970
Well, then... he's very shallow
and he disnae deserve you.

42:08.160 --> 42:10.310
- Come on, tuck in.
- I will in a bit.

42:11.800 --> 42:13.100
OK.

42:16.960 --> 42:19.410
This could be a blessing
in disguise, you know?

42:19.960 --> 42:23.299
All this -- I mean,
you could go back to university.

42:23.300 --> 42:25.399
I want to hang round here for a bit.

42:25.400 --> 42:28.139
I'm thinking of doing
something voluntary.

42:28.140 --> 42:30.039
Working with a charity, maybe.

42:30.040 --> 42:33.239
That's a good idea. Apart from
the fact you don't get paid.

42:33.240 --> 42:35.879
Yeah, but I just need
to do something fun.

42:35.880 --> 42:38.530
Something that'll give me
a bit of faith in people again.

42:52.480 --> 42:55.100
- Is six all right?
- Mum?

42:55.800 --> 42:57.100
Look...

43:03.320 --> 43:04.620
It's OK.

43:07.920 --> 43:09.879
Thank you.

43:09.880 --> 43:12.550
For what you said on the radio.

43:13.050 --> 43:14.350
No need.

43:16.360 --> 43:17.660
You know...

43:19.360 --> 43:22.019
You know, I always believed
that you thought it was me.

43:22.020 --> 43:23.520
I never said that.

43:25.840 --> 43:28.319
I thought the world of your Lizzie,
you know that?

43:28.320 --> 43:30.629
I know you did.
I remember.

43:30.630 --> 43:33.360
I just wish that none of this
had happened to you.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.300
Thank you.

43:42.320 --> 43:44.150
Your wee girl, eh?

43:45.960 --> 43:48.340
Looks just like you and Lizzie did.

44:03.200 --> 44:04.900
You OK?

44:06.160 --> 44:07.959
What was he saying?

44:07.960 --> 44:09.719
He just wanted to say hello.

44:09.720 --> 44:11.279
That was all.

44:11.280 --> 44:13.700
It's all right.
OK? It's all right.

44:24.920 --> 44:27.239
<i>I think she's been drowning
her sorrows.</i>

44:27.240 --> 44:28.889
<i>Aye.
She'll bounce back.</i>

44:28.890 --> 44:31.359
Might take more than a bottle
of wine and a pizza, though.

44:31.360 --> 44:34.360
I'm more worried she disnae
want to go back to uni.

44:39.400 --> 44:41.300
Let's give her a wee bit of time.

44:42.400 --> 44:44.370
You must remember what it was like.

44:47.160 --> 44:49.039
No, you've got no idea
what it was like.

44:49.040 --> 44:50.790
You've never been chucked.

44:51.960 --> 44:53.439
No!

44:53.440 --> 44:55.650
I was always the chucker,
never the chuckee.

45:00.800 --> 45:03.879
She needs to get into the big bad
world, Jimmy, you know?

45:03.880 --> 45:06.250
If she settles in here,
she'll never leave.

45:06.760 --> 45:08.439
What's wrong with that?

45:08.440 --> 45:10.549
What, you want her wasting
her talents?

45:10.550 --> 45:13.389
No, but if she disnae want to go,
I'm not going to force her.

45:13.390 --> 45:15.049
I want her to be happy,
wherever she is.

45:15.050 --> 45:16.359
Aye, so do I --
I just...

45:16.360 --> 45:19.600
I want her to fulfil
her potential you know?

45:20.420 --> 45:21.720
Aye.

45:24.120 --> 45:25.420
Cass...

45:27.440 --> 45:29.709
You're better off in your bed,
darling.

45:29.710 --> 45:31.869
- What time is it?
- It's late.

45:31.870 --> 45:34.890
Did you...
get any of that to eat?

45:35.600 --> 45:37.319
I wasn't hungry.

45:37.320 --> 45:40.889
Darling, I can make you
something now, if you like.

45:40.890 --> 45:42.799
The fridge is empty.

45:42.800 --> 45:45.119
What have you been living on,
anyway?

45:45.120 --> 45:47.120
I'm surprised
you don't have scurvy.

45:53.400 --> 45:54.760
Honey...

45:59.200 --> 46:01.159
It's like someone died.

46:01.160 --> 46:04.159
Sorry, that was stupid.

46:04.160 --> 46:05.719
That's exactly what it's like.

46:05.720 --> 46:08.420
Like nothing's ever going to be
the same again.

46:11.480 --> 46:14.380
Yer man had his chance,
and he blew it.

46:18.560 --> 46:20.429
I just can't get used to the fact

46:20.430 --> 46:22.330
I'll never see his face again

46:25.680 --> 46:27.540
"Now my ladder's gone...

46:28.600 --> 46:32.790
".. I must lie down where
all ladders start,

46:33.440 --> 46:36.679
"in the foul rag
and bone shop

46:36.680 --> 46:38.320
"of the heart."

46:39.520 --> 46:42.439
The only poem I remember
from school.

46:42.440 --> 46:43.940
It'll get better.

46:45.340 --> 46:46.900
I promise.

47:44.800 --> 47:49.019
<i>She was strangled using a scarf --</i>
or possibly a soft belt.

47:49.020 --> 47:53.299
No skin under her fingernails
and no foreign DNA on her.

47:53.300 --> 47:55.240
- There any defensive wounds?
- No.

47:57.080 --> 47:58.459
Right, so...

47:58.460 --> 48:02.549
she either knew her attacker,
or they surprised her.

48:02.550 --> 48:04.380
Or she passed out.

48:05.040 --> 48:07.959
How similar is this to the
Lizzie Kilmuir case?

48:07.960 --> 48:09.969
- Can you remember?
- It could be coincidence

48:09.970 --> 48:12.420
that the body was found
in a lime kiln...

48:13.040 --> 48:14.849
.. or a copycat,

48:14.850 --> 48:16.859
or maybe even
someone deliberately

48:16.860 --> 48:19.060
wanting you to believe
it was Thomas Malone.

48:19.840 --> 48:22.700
One thing that is similar
is the victims.

48:23.380 --> 48:26.599
Lizzie and Sally were alike --

48:26.600 --> 48:29.250
both strong willed,
and very bright.

48:30.120 --> 48:32.320
But you already knew that.

48:35.720 --> 48:37.120
Can I have a word?

48:39.000 --> 48:41.999
I was checking
the paperwork on Tosh's transfer.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.990
It appears she withdrew
the request -- weeks ago.

48:48.040 --> 48:49.780
She's not going anywhere.

49:07.520 --> 49:09.519
Mum thought I'd find you here.

49:09.520 --> 49:12.209
She wants you to come
to our house for some food.

49:12.210 --> 49:13.559
I don't feel like eating, son.

49:13.560 --> 49:16.570
Me, too -- but that won't help.

49:21.080 --> 49:22.750
Malone.

49:23.600 --> 49:25.189
Drew! Wait!

49:25.190 --> 49:26.490
Malone!

49:29.480 --> 49:31.510
Drew, what are you doing?
Leave him.

49:32.120 --> 49:34.679
I'm talking to you! Why did
you have to come back here?

49:34.680 --> 49:36.359
Don't get into a fight
with him, please!

49:36.360 --> 49:38.379
- You just wanted to punish us, didn't you?
- Drew!

49:38.380 --> 49:40.199
- Didn't you?!
- Drew!

49:40.200 --> 49:42.639
Well, enjoy your freedom, Malone.

49:42.640 --> 49:44.319
Enjoy the sun on your face.

49:44.320 --> 49:46.559
Live every minute
like it will be your last --

49:46.560 --> 49:48.520
because you are going back inside!

49:50.240 --> 49:53.090
You know, your daughter,
she didnae deserve this...

49:54.720 --> 49:57.150
- .. but you did.
- Bastard!

49:57.460 --> 49:59.760
Stop it!

50:01.000 --> 50:02.409
Get off him.

50:02.410 --> 50:05.070
Get off!
Just stop it, the pair of you.

50:05.820 --> 50:07.120
Thomas...

50:08.800 --> 50:10.400
It's all right, OK?

50:14.160 --> 50:16.160
It's OK.
It's all right.

50:24.360 --> 50:27.760
<i>They just followed Thomas
down the road, and attacked him.</i>

50:29.560 --> 50:31.479
<i>Who hit who first?</i>

50:31.480 --> 50:34.660
<i>The younger man. He just started
shouting and punching him.</i>

50:38.400 --> 50:41.140
<i>I imagine what happened to
Sally has...</i>

50:43.000 --> 50:44.790
.. thrown everyone.

50:48.400 --> 50:50.310
<i>I was listening to you on the radio.</i>

50:50.960 --> 50:54.919
Do you mind me asking what made you
phone in in the first place?

50:54.920 --> 50:57.340
I didn't like the tone
of the interview.

50:58.840 --> 51:02.879
Now, is that because you've always
thought that Thomas was innocent?

51:02.880 --> 51:04.180
I had my doubts.

51:05.900 --> 51:07.759
Well, then,
do you mind me asking

51:07.760 --> 51:09.919
why didn't you say
that at the time?

51:09.920 --> 51:11.700
Nobody asked.

51:15.160 --> 51:16.999
You were never interviewed
by the police?

51:17.000 --> 51:19.619
No, they said they didn't want
to put me under

51:19.620 --> 51:22.220
any unnecessary pressure
if they didn't need to.

51:29.840 --> 51:32.799
Because you're one of the
very, very few people on this island

51:32.800 --> 51:36.119
that doesn't think Thomas Malone
killed your sister.

51:36.120 --> 51:37.769
There are very few
people on the island

51:37.770 --> 51:40.290
who actually knew my sister.

51:50.320 --> 51:51.920
So, how do you want to play this?

51:52.680 --> 51:54.879
If we don't charge Alan Killick
with common assault,

51:54.880 --> 51:57.009
it'll be open season on Malone.

51:57.010 --> 51:58.319
He was provoked.

51:58.320 --> 52:00.750
We've got about a dozen witnesses
saying he wasn't.

52:01.400 --> 52:03.530
Give him a conditional caution.

52:04.760 --> 52:07.160
If it happens again
it counts as a charge.

52:09.040 --> 52:11.590
And what about Drew McColl?

52:32.170 --> 52:33.579
Come on, Drew.

52:33.580 --> 52:35.400
I'm going to give you lift home.

52:52.960 --> 52:54.620
Do you still miss Fran?

52:57.800 --> 53:01.550
I still have bad days,
every now and then.

53:04.080 --> 53:05.990
My Eileen killed herself.

53:06.740 --> 53:08.150
You probably heard that.

53:09.800 --> 53:11.159
Sally always blamed me.

53:11.160 --> 53:13.359
She never said it,
but it was there.

53:13.360 --> 53:14.669
Felt I...

53:14.670 --> 53:17.970
didn't threat
her depression seriously.

53:19.560 --> 53:21.300
Now I've lost 'em both.

53:24.800 --> 53:27.230
Never take your daughter
for granted, Jimmy.

53:28.880 --> 53:30.880
Don't let her slip away.

53:45.480 --> 53:47.959
Molly was checking
the town centre CCTV

53:47.960 --> 53:49.719
from the night Sally went missing.

53:49.720 --> 53:52.730
There he is,
getting a takeaway at midnight.

53:53.280 --> 53:54.780
Alan Killick.

53:55.670 --> 53:58.029
According to Donna,
he was home by 11:00.

53:58.030 --> 54:00.269
Then this. Either he
decided he wasn't hungry

54:00.270 --> 54:02.799
or he was deliberately trying
to give himself an alibi.

54:02.800 --> 54:04.909
All right, check the Taj.
See what they remember.

54:04.910 --> 54:06.720
See if he went anywhere else.

54:11.480 --> 54:13.589
Any news on that ticket stub?

54:13.590 --> 54:16.099
First attempt failed
to get a usable print.

54:16.100 --> 54:18.609
They said they'd have another go,
but it's not looking good.

54:18.610 --> 54:21.799
Also, I checked Gail Callahan's
phone records.

54:21.800 --> 54:23.559
The call between her
and Thomas Malone

54:23.560 --> 54:24.889
on the night Sally
went missing

54:24.890 --> 54:26.900
lasted no more than
three minutes --

54:27.440 --> 54:31.290
so she's either telling porkies
or she's "misremembered".

54:34.680 --> 54:36.580
Right,
don't stay too late.

54:38.960 --> 54:40.500
Night.

54:41.360 --> 54:43.640
I've withdrawn my transfer request.

54:44.320 --> 54:45.620
I just...

54:47.440 --> 54:49.040
I don't feel ready yet.

54:50.200 --> 54:51.500
OK.

54:53.920 --> 54:55.930
I didn't want to tell you.

54:57.360 --> 54:59.999
I thought you'd think I was a bit...

55:00.000 --> 55:01.300
.. pathetic.

55:03.080 --> 55:05.199
I think whatever decision you made,

55:05.200 --> 55:08.890
either to stay or go,
it was going to be hard.

55:10.960 --> 55:12.980
I'm just glad you're staying.

56:25.780 --> 56:27.080
Go on!

56:28.700 --> 56:30.029
Where are you, Thomas?

56:30.030 --> 56:31.719
- Come on.
- You're dead!

56:31.720 --> 56:33.890
Get the fuck out of my house!

56:36.160 --> 56:38.820
It wasn't me!
It wasn't me!

57:02.920 --> 57:05.999
Take a good look, Malone. This is
where we're going to bury you --

57:06.000 --> 57:07.539
if you don't admit what you did.

57:07.540 --> 57:09.080
- It wasnae me.
- Just say it.

57:09.590 --> 57:10.890
Say it!

57:11.520 --> 57:13.269
It wasnae...
It wasnae me.

57:13.270 --> 57:14.570
Bury him.
