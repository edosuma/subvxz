WEBVTT

00:08.312 --> 00:10.401
Nothing.

00:10.445 --> 00:13.274
There's gotta be some spell,
some potion,

00:13.317 --> 00:14.753
something to give us the power

00:14.797 --> 00:17.191
so we can touch the Loom
without turning extra crispy.

00:17.234 --> 00:19.149
- There's also the question
of who's gonna use it with me.

00:19.193 --> 00:22.283
The Loom requires three weavers
who are as powerful as gods.

00:22.326 --> 00:24.198
- Well, I'm not leaving
my mom's life

00:24.241 --> 00:26.461
in the hands of you idiots.

00:26.504 --> 00:27.679
- Wow, okay,
well, that's one person.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.203
What do you think, Sara?

00:29.246 --> 00:32.119
- I mean, I'm already a blind,
time-traveling paragon

00:32.162 --> 00:35.122
who can see the future,
so might as well just add

00:35.165 --> 00:36.906
wannabe god to the list.

00:36.949 --> 00:39.604
- Speaking of which,
can you use your Sara-vision

00:39.648 --> 00:42.085
to tell me if what I need
is in this book?

00:43.347 --> 00:44.740
- Nothing there.

00:44.783 --> 00:46.263
You know,
you could just read the book.

00:46.307 --> 00:48.222
- You know, I would do anything
to save Behrad,

00:48.265 --> 00:49.266
but this is faster.

00:51.181 --> 00:53.314
These are all the spell books
in the manor you asked for.

00:53.357 --> 00:55.838
- Yes, you're a good man, Gary.

00:57.492 --> 01:00.843
And these are for you.

01:00.886 --> 01:04.368
- Mm--can you just
give them to me?

01:04.412 --> 01:05.587
Thank you.

01:05.630 --> 01:07.067
- Shouldn't you be resting?

01:07.110 --> 01:08.459
- Shouldn't you get out
of my face?

01:08.503 --> 01:10.026
- Yep.
- You know, he's right, love.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.159
Getting some rest
wouldn't be a bad thing.

01:12.202 --> 01:13.464
- Not gonna happen.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.814
Look, the sooner we find
this magical cure-all,

01:15.858 --> 01:18.339
then the sooner we can use
the Loom and get my sight back.

01:18.382 --> 01:20.167
- Uh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

01:20.210 --> 01:23.126
This book says that Merlin
used the Philosopher's Stone.

01:23.170 --> 01:24.693
- Pshh, that thing's
as real as Santa.

01:24.736 --> 01:26.782
- Shh, Gary's in the room.

01:26.825 --> 01:27.870
- What?

01:27.913 --> 01:29.263
- Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

01:29.306 --> 01:30.916
The Chalice of Dionysus.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.441
It says here that the chalice
was gifted to an Olympian,

01:33.484 --> 01:35.312
Dionysus, by his father, Zeus.

01:35.356 --> 01:38.098
Whoever drinks from it
becomes a god.

01:38.141 --> 01:40.056
- But only for a day.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.666
Well, don't get your hopes up,
all right?

01:41.710 --> 01:43.146
The Olympians
fed off devotions.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.366
Once they lost their followers,
they just died off.

01:45.409 --> 01:48.543
And their enchanted objects--
lost to time.

01:48.586 --> 01:50.893
- I've seen that.

01:50.936 --> 01:52.982
I've seen that.
I've seen that in college.

01:53.025 --> 01:55.245
- Okay, your degree
is finally paying off.

01:55.289 --> 01:56.855
What class did you see it in?

01:56.899 --> 01:59.162
- Oh, that was not in a class.

01:59.206 --> 02:01.295
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug!

02:01.338 --> 02:02.992
Chug, chug, chug, chug!

02:03.035 --> 02:05.690
- It's called the Chug Cup,
all right?

02:05.734 --> 02:08.302
Campus legend said
that whoever drank from it

02:08.345 --> 02:10.217
became invincible for a day.

02:15.874 --> 02:17.441
- And I went to a rival
school, so the only way

02:17.485 --> 02:20.227
I could get a taste of it
is if we, you know...

02:20.270 --> 02:23.360
- Hey!
- Who's that?

02:26.755 --> 02:29.366
Hudson sucks!
Brixton rules!

02:29.410 --> 02:30.193
Whoa!

02:30.237 --> 02:32.326
all: Yeah!

02:32.369 --> 02:34.154
- Stole it.

02:34.197 --> 02:36.895
- Do we really think
that Dionysus' Chalice

02:36.939 --> 02:38.462
is with a bunch of frat boys?

02:38.506 --> 02:39.811
- Yes.

02:39.855 --> 02:41.291
- A scan of social media
confirms

02:41.335 --> 02:43.337
that a chalice matching
that of Dionysus

02:43.380 --> 02:45.469
is currently in possession of
the Sigma Psi Phi fraternity

02:45.513 --> 02:46.731
at Hudson University.

02:46.775 --> 02:48.603
- So we get that,
I become immortal,

02:48.646 --> 02:52.215
use the Loom, and I can forget
I ever knew you people.

02:53.477 --> 02:54.870
- Well then, Legends,

02:54.913 --> 02:57.351
you better get your
togas dry-cleaned

02:57.394 --> 03:00.397
because we are going Greek.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.151
- So, babe, all right,
every year,

03:15.195 --> 03:17.458
the Chug Cup is presented
at the student fair,

03:17.501 --> 03:18.894
and then, apparently,
fraternities and sororities

03:18.937 --> 03:20.374
compete for the right
to drink in it

03:20.417 --> 03:22.289
in something called
the Chug Challenge.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.334
- Definitely our best place
to try to steal the chalice.

03:24.378 --> 03:25.596
- Truth.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.119
- Okay,
I can get around the ship,

03:27.163 --> 03:28.860
but I'm not so sure
about navigating my way

03:28.904 --> 03:30.471
through a bunch
of drunk college kids...

03:30.514 --> 03:32.473
- Mm-hmm.
- So you got this.

03:32.516 --> 03:33.517
- Yeah.
- Team loves you.

03:33.561 --> 03:34.910
Don't worry.

03:34.953 --> 03:36.172
- Okay, I know--
I'm not really worried

03:36.216 --> 03:37.260
about them accepting me.

03:37.304 --> 03:39.262
The college kids
on the other hand--

03:39.306 --> 03:40.568
- Hi, Aunt Ava, Sara.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.311
Lita, honey, I am so, so glad
that you're still here.

03:44.354 --> 03:45.964
I need you to help me
with something.

03:46.008 --> 03:48.750
Um, what are the, like,
kids into these days?

03:48.793 --> 03:51.013
Like, I need 'em
to think I'm cool.

03:51.056 --> 03:52.971
- Mission's at Hudson U.
- Yeah.

03:53.015 --> 03:55.278
- Oh, my guidance counselor
told me to apply there.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.280
- Oh.
- Sweetie, that's amazing.

03:57.324 --> 03:59.195
- Oh, I can't afford it.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.197
- You should do it.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.112
If you wanna do it,
I can make it happen.

04:03.155 --> 04:04.461
- Yeah, I mean,
it could be cool

04:04.505 --> 04:06.333
to take a tour.
We're here, right?

04:06.376 --> 04:09.074
- Yeah, yeah,
the mission's all good, Rory.

04:09.118 --> 04:11.947
You should definitely do that.
- Okay, thanks.

04:11.990 --> 04:13.514
If you want kids
to think you're cool,

04:13.557 --> 04:14.906
I wouldn't wear that.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.212
They're gonna think
you look like a narc.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.735
- I'm--what--I--

04:29.965 --> 04:32.707
- Welcome
to Hudson University.

04:34.012 --> 04:35.884
You smell that?

04:35.927 --> 04:38.016
Mmm, that smells like
the good, old days.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.367
-  I've had it.
I can't breathe in here.

04:40.410 --> 04:41.542
Ooh, maybe it was
for the better.

04:41.585 --> 04:43.065
What is that smell?

04:43.108 --> 04:44.893
- Okay, so the Sigmas
hosted the games.

04:44.936 --> 04:46.286
We find them, we find the cup.

04:46.329 --> 04:47.939
- Great, let's fan out.
Zari, thank you.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.593
Nate, take up the north end.
- Mm-hmm.

04:49.637 --> 04:50.638
- Thank you.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.553
Astra, Charlie, you guys are--

04:52.596 --> 04:54.685
- Let's just find this chalice
so we can get this over with.

04:54.729 --> 04:56.078
- I wasn't finished, but--

04:56.121 --> 04:57.340
- I'll go after her.
- Thank you.

04:59.081 --> 05:00.430
- ♪ You only wish
you could be me ♪

05:00.474 --> 05:03.085
- Pledge Theta.
Find your girl gang.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.391
- Maybe you can tell me
where I can find

05:04.434 --> 05:05.609
the Chalice of Dionysus.

05:05.653 --> 05:06.915
- Sorry,
we're just really excited

05:06.958 --> 05:08.177
about the Chug Challenge.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.483
- Why are we even doing this?

05:09.526 --> 05:10.527
We should just take it
by force.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.268
- Listen to me.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.617
In order to use the Loom,
the weavers have to be in sync.

05:13.661 --> 05:15.140
Now, I'm not gonna
let you use it

05:15.184 --> 05:17.142
unless you can prove
that you can work as a team.

05:17.186 --> 05:18.579
- Let me?

05:18.622 --> 05:22.365
I left Hell 'cause I was done
working for a Fate.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.764
- And that was Quincy Hall,
our economics building.

05:29.807 --> 05:31.592
Hudson has the top program
in the country.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.376
- Oh, did you hear that, Henry?
- Yeah.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.769
- He's majoring in finance.

05:34.812 --> 05:37.249
I told him you have to go
to Hudson.

05:37.293 --> 05:39.904
- Well, you know that's not
the only reason, Gene.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.645
- Guilty.

05:41.689 --> 05:43.734
I want him to follow
in Dad's footsteps.

05:43.778 --> 05:47.042
I'm an alumnus.
You probably noticed the scarf.

05:47.085 --> 05:48.565
- Yeah.

05:48.609 --> 05:49.784
I'd like to wring your neck
with it.

05:49.827 --> 05:51.612
- What was that?
- I said--

05:52.656 --> 05:54.745
- I said it's a great building,

05:54.789 --> 05:57.008
good brick structure,
fire resistant.

05:57.052 --> 05:58.749
- Oh, you really know
your architecture.

05:58.793 --> 06:00.534
Where did you study?
- Iron Heights.

06:00.577 --> 06:01.752
- Haven't heard of it.

06:01.796 --> 06:03.406
- It's a super prestigious
art school.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.016
- Oh.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.454
Just go with it.

06:10.544 --> 06:12.502
- I can't believe
I'm back here.

06:12.546 --> 06:14.112
They used to call me
Shotgun Nate.

06:14.156 --> 06:15.592
- I think I know why, but why?

06:15.636 --> 06:17.333
- Is that true, Pops?

06:17.377 --> 06:19.161
Show us what you got.

06:19.204 --> 06:20.467
- Pops?

06:20.510 --> 06:21.946
Pop--

06:21.990 --> 06:23.600
Pops.

06:23.644 --> 06:25.254
Pops.

06:32.043 --> 06:33.871
And I also turn to steel.
- Whoa!

06:33.915 --> 06:36.570
- Okay, come on, Grandpa.
We gotta keep looking.

06:38.615 --> 06:40.138
Sigma Psi Phi.

06:40.182 --> 06:42.140
Sigma Psi Phi!
Sigma Psi Phi!

06:42.184 --> 06:43.446
- Ava, I think
we found the Sigmas.

06:43.490 --> 06:46.101
Ava, hello?

06:46.144 --> 06:47.668
- Ugh.

06:47.711 --> 06:49.626
Ugh.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.498
I'm on my way.

06:52.716 --> 06:53.935
Sigma Psi Phi!

06:53.978 --> 06:55.806
Sigma Psi Phi!
Sigma Psi Phi!

06:55.850 --> 06:57.504
Sigma Psi Phi!

06:57.547 --> 07:00.507
Sigma Psi Phi!
Sigma Psi Phi!

07:00.550 --> 07:02.509
Sigma Psi Phi!
Huh!

07:02.552 --> 07:04.032
- Oh, wow.

07:04.075 --> 07:06.904
That was just like my entrance
to the 2044 VMAs.

07:14.782 --> 07:17.698
- What's up, Hudson Hedonists?

07:19.221 --> 07:23.399
Welcome
to the Chug Challenges pregame!

07:23.443 --> 07:25.923
- That's the chalice--
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:25.967 --> 07:27.621
That's Dion.
- Hm?

07:27.664 --> 07:29.710
- He was the head of the Sigmas
when I was in school.

07:29.753 --> 07:31.581
The guy hasn't aged a day.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.583
We have so much
in common, like--

07:33.627 --> 07:35.672
- Dude, that's because
your Dion is Dionysus.

07:35.716 --> 07:37.935
This is the Greek god
of wine and revelry.

07:37.979 --> 07:39.676
God, the guy's a riot,
honestly.

07:39.720 --> 07:44.464
- Now, as Chug Keeper,
I get the honor

07:44.507 --> 07:46.770
of announcing
our 2020 challenges!

07:49.599 --> 07:54.735
I will reveal the first round
tonight at the Sigma rager!

07:54.778 --> 07:58.478
Now let the challenge begin!

08:01.568 --> 08:04.179
- Look, just leave
this to me, all right?

08:04.222 --> 08:05.528
Oy, Dion.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.793
Should I say, Dionysus?
It's me, Clotho.

08:09.837 --> 08:11.621
- Clotho?
- Yes.

08:11.665 --> 08:13.580
- Damn, it's really you!

08:13.623 --> 08:15.582
My God.

08:15.625 --> 08:20.282
The Loombreaker
is in the house!

08:20.325 --> 08:22.937
Dude, back before
people had free will,

08:22.980 --> 08:26.680
the gods were always
reigning in the party.

08:26.723 --> 08:28.420
But look at me now!

08:28.464 --> 08:29.857
- You're in college.

08:29.900 --> 08:32.250
- Yeah, I know.
I'm a lifer.

08:32.294 --> 08:33.991
Found a place where
the party doesn't stop,

08:34.035 --> 08:35.732
and I haven't left since.

08:35.776 --> 08:37.734
Honestly, they worship me here,

08:37.778 --> 08:40.563
and they don't even know
that I'm theparty god.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.130
- Hey, listen, man.
- Yeah.

08:42.173 --> 08:43.653
- I kind of wanted to ask
a little favor of you.

08:43.697 --> 08:46.743
- Yeah, anything
for the Loombreaker, and--

08:46.787 --> 08:49.224
sick, is this your squad?
- Yeah.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.965
- Yeah, they call me
Shotgun Nate.

08:51.008 --> 08:52.793
I went to Brixton, but--
- All right, enough of this.

08:52.836 --> 08:53.620
- Whoa, whoa, what--

08:53.663 --> 08:55.665
- Hey, whoa.

08:55.709 --> 08:59.016
So that's why
you're really here.

08:59.060 --> 09:01.671
Wanted to give your gang
a little taste of immortality?

09:01.715 --> 09:03.151
Hmm?
Is that what it is?

09:03.194 --> 09:04.500
But here's the thing.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.676
To pick this up,
you gotta be Greek,

09:06.720 --> 09:08.069
and I gotta deem you worthy.

09:08.112 --> 09:09.636
- Okay, how are we
supposed to do that?

09:09.679 --> 09:11.420
- Ah, good question--
you gotta either join

09:11.463 --> 09:13.988
a sorority, a fraternity,
or a frorority,

09:14.031 --> 09:15.816
and you gotta win
the Chug Challenge.

09:15.859 --> 09:16.860
- This is ridiculous.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.601
- Ah, and that's
what makes it fun.

09:20.821 --> 09:22.474
See you, Clotho.

09:22.518 --> 09:24.520
- He's still so--ow.
- Just stop.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.478
I need to focus.
I need to think of something.

09:26.522 --> 09:27.871
- I have an idea--
- No.

09:27.915 --> 09:30.657
Something that does not
involve maiming.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.666
- Since the chalice
belongs to Dion,

09:39.709 --> 09:41.581
we gotta follow his rules.

09:41.624 --> 09:44.714
You guys,
we're gonna win that cup.

09:49.806 --> 09:51.286
- So what you're saying is

09:51.329 --> 09:53.288
in order to use
the Loom of Fate,

09:53.331 --> 09:55.507
we have to join a sorority?

09:55.551 --> 09:58.380
-  Finally,
a mission I can get behind.

09:58.423 --> 09:59.860
- Luckily for us,
the Thetas are hosting

09:59.903 --> 10:01.862
a pledge social today.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.777
- This cannot be your plan.

10:03.820 --> 10:04.865
- Look, as long
as Dion's got the cup,

10:04.908 --> 10:06.780
we gotta play by his rules.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.608
- Counterpoint, you don't get
anywhere playing by the rules.

10:08.651 --> 10:09.913
- Oh, really?

10:09.957 --> 10:11.175
Because I think I was
about to win him over

10:11.219 --> 10:13.047
before you tried
to nab the cup.

10:13.090 --> 10:14.962
- Hey, okay, so,

10:15.005 --> 10:17.965
who wants to rush
Theta Lambda Ro?

10:18.008 --> 10:19.706
- No, no, no, no, no.
Just stop.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.533
Charlie, Astra,
you'll pledge Theta.

10:21.577 --> 10:23.579
Just try to remember
you're on the same side, yeah?

10:23.623 --> 10:24.624
- Yeah.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.364
- Yeah, sure we are.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.892
She's exhausting.

10:31.935 --> 10:33.328
- So I'm doing
track and debate,

10:33.371 --> 10:35.504
plus my dad
got me this internship.

10:35.547 --> 10:38.072
What are your extracurriculars?

10:38.115 --> 10:39.682
- I was in band
for a while, but I quit

10:39.726 --> 10:42.859
'cause no one else wanted
to play the Replacements.

10:42.903 --> 10:45.688
And I have a part-time job.
I heard that helps.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.821
- Actually, to get into
a place like this,

10:47.864 --> 10:51.607
you'll really wanna build out
your application.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.785
- And here we are
at Neuman hall.

10:55.829 --> 10:58.832
The name might sound familiar
to some families on this tour.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.398
- Oh, Henry Neuman.

11:00.442 --> 11:02.096
This is actually
my grandfather's building,

11:02.139 --> 11:04.533
which should help my chances
of getting in here.

11:04.576 --> 11:06.709
- Hey, hope I didn't miss
too much of the tour.

11:06.753 --> 11:09.581
Just to be super clear, I'm not
a prospective student, okay?

11:09.625 --> 11:13.716
My name's Dr. Nate Heywood.
I got my PhD from Brixton.

11:13.760 --> 11:14.848
Go big red!

11:14.891 --> 11:16.501
- Oh, a doctor.

11:16.545 --> 11:18.765
- Yeah.
- And Lita's dad.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.288
- What?
- What?

11:21.158 --> 11:22.769
- Just go with it.

11:25.989 --> 11:27.774
- Thank you for your inquiry.
I think it's really...

11:27.817 --> 11:30.951
- Hi, how's it going?

11:30.994 --> 11:33.388
Hi.

11:33.431 --> 11:37.000
I can't believe we are
this close to becoming Thetas.

11:37.044 --> 11:40.743
I don't even know you,
but we could be sisters.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.702
- I'm only here
as a performance.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.138
Notice my empty teacup--

11:44.181 --> 11:46.227
a commentary on the emptiness
of this charade.

11:46.270 --> 11:48.795
- Oh, my God,
we should start a group text.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.753
What are your numbers?

11:52.320 --> 11:55.105
- Welcome
to the Theta luncheon.

11:55.149 --> 11:56.846
Everybody, look around you.

11:56.890 --> 11:59.153
This could be your new family.

11:59.196 --> 12:01.808
The ones you turn to
for support,

12:01.851 --> 12:04.593
sisterhood, guidance--

12:04.636 --> 12:06.377
that is,
as long as you make the cut.

12:06.421 --> 12:07.683
So...

12:07.727 --> 12:09.859
Bid Theta, all right?

12:13.036 --> 12:14.385
What are you doing?

12:14.429 --> 12:15.822
Come on, we've got to try
and convince these people

12:15.865 --> 12:19.521
no matter what.
Now just try and fit in please.

12:19.564 --> 12:22.176
- Fine.
Want me to fit in?

12:24.091 --> 12:26.180
Waiter, replace this drink.

12:26.223 --> 12:29.052
If I wanted weak tea,
I'd rush Omega.

12:29.096 --> 12:32.926
- Oh, this girl's fire.

12:32.969 --> 12:34.449
I like that.

12:34.492 --> 12:36.581
We're gonna start
with your table.

12:38.888 --> 12:41.891
This here is the house paddle,

12:41.935 --> 12:43.850
our most sacred object.

12:43.893 --> 12:45.503
I'm going to ask a question,

12:45.547 --> 12:47.027
and when you're holding
the paddle,

12:47.070 --> 12:49.725
it's your turn
to answer, okay?

12:49.769 --> 12:50.900
- Mm.

12:50.944 --> 12:53.860
What did you do before college?

12:55.383 --> 12:58.603
- So I grew up in Hell,
had minions do my bidding,

12:58.647 --> 13:01.781
and rose to power till
I practically ran the place.

13:01.824 --> 13:04.827
- Oh, and she's ambitious.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.176
Now you go.

13:06.220 --> 13:10.572
- Oh, okay, well,
I traveled around the world

13:10.615 --> 13:13.880
with a bunch of friends--
- Oh, more like rejects.

13:15.098 --> 13:16.708
- But before that,

13:16.752 --> 13:19.146
I was actually in this
really cool punk band.

13:19.189 --> 13:22.149
- Yeah,
Thetas don't really do punk.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.933
- Yeah, I know her type.

13:23.977 --> 13:26.849
You pretend like you're
all about bucking the system,

13:26.893 --> 13:28.198
and then you get pissed

13:28.242 --> 13:30.070
when people don't
fall in line behind you.

13:31.985 --> 13:34.857
You think you're better than
the sisters you ran away from,

13:34.901 --> 13:38.992
but the truth is,
you're all the same.

13:40.732 --> 13:43.648
- That's a little bit rich,
isn't it?

13:43.692 --> 13:45.215
Coming from my sister's lapdog.

13:48.131 --> 13:50.655
- No, just--

13:50.699 --> 13:51.918
- No!

13:58.663 --> 14:02.319
- Oh, Theta--no.

14:04.104 --> 14:05.496
You know what?

14:05.540 --> 14:07.542
This whole table is exiled.

14:07.585 --> 14:10.371
None of you are Theta material.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.513
- How'd the mission go?

14:22.557 --> 14:23.688
You immortal
sorority girls yet?

14:23.732 --> 14:25.473
I need a drink.

14:25.516 --> 14:28.563
- Mm, the refreshing sound
of failure.

14:28.606 --> 14:31.435
- We would be well on our way
to using the Loom right now

14:31.479 --> 14:33.350
if someone hadn't blown it.

14:33.394 --> 14:34.743
- Our cover was blown

14:34.786 --> 14:36.223
because you decided
to go Hell mode on us.

14:36.266 --> 14:37.441
- Oh, you think
that was Hell mode?

14:37.485 --> 14:38.834
Honey.
- Call me "honey" again.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.009
Go on, I dare you.

14:40.053 --> 14:41.576
- Try me and you'll wish
you were immortal.

14:41.619 --> 14:43.099
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, okay, whoa, whoa, stop.

14:43.143 --> 14:44.622
No one's killing anyone.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.450
- Ooh, Astra was definitely
gonna go for it.

14:46.494 --> 14:47.887
Zari, hide that fork.

14:47.930 --> 14:50.019
- Charlie, just chill.
Please sit down.

14:50.063 --> 14:51.586
Just take a breath, yeah?

14:51.629 --> 14:53.980
All right, you good?
Okay.

14:54.023 --> 14:56.069
All right, we need to find
another way to get the chalice.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.897
- You can't defy a god.

14:57.940 --> 15:01.291
We have to win as a sorority,
and with no sorority...

15:01.335 --> 15:04.033
- We're screwed.
- Yeah.

15:05.382 --> 15:08.429
- Ladies,
we're gonna start our own.

15:08.472 --> 15:10.300
- I can't tell.
Is she serious?

15:11.998 --> 15:13.260
- I think so.

15:13.303 --> 15:14.826
Becoming an official sorority
by tonight?

15:14.870 --> 15:16.785
I mean, the paperwork
alone would--

15:18.091 --> 15:20.093
Let's do it.
- Yes.

15:20.136 --> 15:21.790
- Why not?

15:21.833 --> 15:23.748
- I really should have killed
you all when I had the chance.

15:23.792 --> 15:26.012
- Go sisters!

15:26.055 --> 15:27.013
- Whoo.

15:29.145 --> 15:30.233
- We'll get there.

15:30.277 --> 15:31.713
- Oh!

15:31.756 --> 15:33.193
- Do you think my dad's okay?

15:33.236 --> 15:35.064
- Oh, yeah, he comes
and goes as he pleases.

15:35.108 --> 15:36.631
It's really part of his charm.

15:36.674 --> 15:39.416
Bright side is I get to show
you what college is all about.

15:39.460 --> 15:40.983
This is Greek row.

15:41.027 --> 15:43.943
This is where the fraternities
and the sororities live.

15:43.986 --> 15:46.423
They're the most influential
people on campus--

15:46.467 --> 15:48.643
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

15:48.686 --> 15:50.123
- These are the guys
that have the chalice?

15:50.166 --> 15:51.385
- Mm-hmm.

15:51.428 --> 15:53.039
- I wish I could be
more impressed.

15:54.692 --> 15:56.694
- Call the bro patrol.

15:56.738 --> 16:00.002
Looks like somebody
wants to party!

16:00.046 --> 16:01.221
- Is he talking to us?

16:01.264 --> 16:02.352
Act cool, be cool.
- I know--

16:02.396 --> 16:04.485
- Shut up.

16:04.528 --> 16:07.140
This is Agent Heywood
to bro patrol.

16:07.183 --> 16:09.272
Desire to party confirmed.

16:09.316 --> 16:10.578
- Whoo!

16:10.621 --> 16:12.232
How cool was that?

16:12.275 --> 16:14.843
- Do you have a man crush?
- No, it's unrequited.

16:14.886 --> 16:16.801
- You should tell him.
- Shut up.

16:16.845 --> 16:19.108
- Super stoked
that you're here.

16:19.152 --> 16:21.023
Anyone who's a friend
of the Loombreaker

16:21.067 --> 16:22.416
is chill with me,

16:22.459 --> 16:24.853
so snag some bags
and some brews.

16:24.896 --> 16:26.115
Oh, and fear not.

16:26.159 --> 16:28.378
We have energy drinks
for the little ones.

16:28.422 --> 16:31.120
It's all peers no pressures
at Casa de Sigma.

16:31.164 --> 16:33.775
- Uh, I wanna say that's tight,

16:33.818 --> 16:37.039
but I got responsibilities.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.172
- Well, hey, come by anytime,

16:39.215 --> 16:43.350
and we'll party like it's 1999.

16:43.393 --> 16:45.308
- Wait, hold on,
you said these are the guys

16:45.352 --> 16:47.223
that have the chalice, right?
- Uh-huh.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.703
- So why don't you go inside
and get requited,

16:48.746 --> 16:50.183
and I can do some scouting

16:50.226 --> 16:51.445
and find out
where they keep it?

16:51.488 --> 16:52.881
- Only if your dad
doesn't try

16:52.924 --> 16:54.187
to set me on fire
while I'm asleep.

16:54.230 --> 16:56.276
Deal?
- Yeah, deal.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.061
- All right,
so what are we doing?

16:59.105 --> 17:02.064
League rules or two points
for those overhangs?

17:04.719 --> 17:07.069
- Okay, I call to order
the charter meeting

17:07.113 --> 17:09.637
of Delta Chi Sigma,
Sisterhood of Legends.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.160
Let's make a sorority.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.988
- First step, we need a house.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.208
- I say we steal
the Theta's place.

17:15.251 --> 17:16.644
You disable
the carbon monoxide detector,

17:16.687 --> 17:18.080
I'll go in, cut the power--

17:18.124 --> 17:19.951
- Or, I have a more
non-fatal idea.

17:19.995 --> 17:21.388
There's a place
that's been empty

17:21.431 --> 17:23.042
since Pi Epsilon's
last rager.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.479
It was something
about de-Jello-ing.

17:25.522 --> 17:27.089
- Oh, that is really foul.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.265
- Yeah,
but with a little trickery--

17:29.309 --> 17:32.268
I'll just open up a portal.
Instant remodel.

17:32.312 --> 17:34.096
They'll never know
the difference.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.142
- You know, I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

17:36.185 --> 17:38.100
- It's not my fault
you can't resist

17:38.144 --> 17:40.711
my effortless charms.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.800
Obviously we're gonna
have to redecorate.

17:42.844 --> 17:44.193
- Well, you lot have fun.

17:44.237 --> 17:45.934
I can't bear to watch you
desecrate this place.

17:45.977 --> 17:49.633
Oh, and watch out
for these bad boys.

17:49.677 --> 17:52.332
They bite.
- Mm.

17:52.375 --> 17:53.985
So do I.

17:54.029 --> 17:58.816
- Okay, so in order to be
a official sorority,

17:58.860 --> 18:00.470
we need three more sisters,

18:00.514 --> 18:02.124
and if we wanna win
that chalice,

18:02.168 --> 18:04.039
they gotta be good,
so, Gideon, what do you got?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.781
- Inez Martin was voted
out of pep squad

18:06.824 --> 18:08.609
for being too enthusiastic.

18:08.652 --> 18:10.567
- Hey, how's it going?

18:10.611 --> 18:12.091
What's up?
Hi.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.353
Hey there!

18:13.396 --> 18:15.790
- Oh, uh, Inez, right?
- Yes.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.487
- This is weird,
but I was just wondering

18:17.531 --> 18:19.010
if you wanted to join--
- Definitely.

18:19.054 --> 18:20.534
- But you didn't even know
what I was--

18:20.577 --> 18:22.405
- Oh, it doesn't matter.
Where can I meet you?

18:22.449 --> 18:24.407
- Lisa Lindhome,
aspiring influencer,

18:24.451 --> 18:26.801
shunned after becoming
the subject of a viral video

18:26.844 --> 18:29.760
entitled,
"Girl Snarts at Party."

18:29.804 --> 18:32.589
- Wait, what is a snart?

18:32.633 --> 18:34.200

it's when you sneeze and--

18:34.243 --> 18:35.940
- Eh, let's not.

18:35.984 --> 18:37.725
Let's just ease Astra
back onto Earth, all right?

18:37.768 --> 18:39.205
- Fair.

- Silvia Hines.

19:00.182 --> 19:02.402
Created her own major
in performance art.

19:02.445 --> 19:03.490
- You're the ones who tried

19:03.533 --> 19:05.361
to kill each other
at the tea party.

19:05.405 --> 19:06.623
- Yeah, about that--

19:06.667 --> 19:08.321
we've actually started
our own sorority--

19:08.364 --> 19:09.974
- What is the point of partying

19:10.018 --> 19:13.369
with a bunch
of brain-dead wastoids?

19:13.413 --> 19:14.631
- I get it.

19:14.675 --> 19:16.981
Seems impossible
to feel any kind of power

19:17.025 --> 19:19.070
in a cruel, dying world, right?

19:19.114 --> 19:22.291
But have you considered
that winning the masses over

19:22.335 --> 19:24.250
with the illusion of fun

19:24.293 --> 19:26.948
might be the perfect way
to ply them to do your bidding?

19:26.991 --> 19:29.211
- ♪ 'Cause I hope you
work well under pressure ♪

19:29.255 --> 19:31.779
- I'm in.
- Unfortunately, Captain,

19:31.822 --> 19:34.390
the pool of Theta rejects
is slim.

19:34.434 --> 19:36.436
- Beggars can't be choosers.

19:36.479 --> 19:37.828
- I like 'em.

19:39.482 --> 19:42.746
- We chose you because
we know what it's like

19:42.790 --> 19:45.488
looking for a place to belong

19:45.532 --> 19:48.665
because we, too,
were there at your age.

19:48.709 --> 19:52.408
That's why
we've created that place.

19:52.452 --> 19:54.715
And as of today,

19:54.758 --> 19:58.806
you are Deltas.

19:58.849 --> 20:02.331
Welcome to the sisterhood.

20:05.378 --> 20:07.989
- Wait, are you blind?

20:08.032 --> 20:09.817
- Yes.
- I love it.

20:09.860 --> 20:12.254
Deltas are so inclusive.

20:12.298 --> 20:13.777
- But don't we need a motto?

20:13.821 --> 20:15.866
We can't do anything
without a motto.

20:15.910 --> 20:20.306
- Yeah, the sisters...

20:20.349 --> 20:23.700
- Are the glue...

20:23.744 --> 20:29.315
- Glue that greases
the wheels of time.

20:29.358 --> 20:31.795
- But that doesn't make
any sense.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.362
- It's called avant-garde.

20:33.406 --> 20:34.798
- What about,

20:34.842 --> 20:37.366
"We might not have it
all together,

20:37.410 --> 20:41.196
but together, we have it all"?

20:41.240 --> 20:44.373
- Okay, I need that
on a T-shirt, like, now.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.462
- Okay, go...

20:46.506 --> 20:48.464
all: Sisters!

20:48.508 --> 20:50.727
- Sisters!

20:52.163 --> 20:53.600
- I'm telling you,
I can take it.

20:53.643 --> 20:54.775
- Dude, it's 2020.
We don't do that any--

20:54.818 --> 20:57.299
- Da, da, da, da, just do it.

20:57.343 --> 20:59.432
- Yeah.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.348
- Whoa!

21:02.391 --> 21:04.698
- It's like his ass
is made of steel!

21:04.741 --> 21:06.526
- 'Cause it is.

21:21.367 --> 21:22.759
- Whoa.

21:32.378 --> 21:33.596
- Keg's here, D.

21:33.640 --> 21:34.771
- Whoa, hey, man.
Hey.

21:34.815 --> 21:36.338
- So glad that you found us.

21:36.382 --> 21:39.210
I knew that you had brotential
the second I saw you.

21:39.254 --> 21:40.299
- That's nice of you.

21:40.342 --> 21:42.083
- I wanted to mark
the occasion.

21:42.126 --> 21:44.346
It's my special stash.

21:44.390 --> 21:46.870
I brew it out back.
I hope you like IPAs.

21:46.914 --> 21:49.482
- Bro, I am all about the IPAs.

21:49.525 --> 21:51.222
- Yeah?
- You mind?

21:51.266 --> 21:52.441
- Heyo, hit it!

21:57.185 --> 21:58.665
- My man.
- Mmm, so good.

21:58.708 --> 22:00.362
- It's good, yeah,
that brew right there,

22:00.406 --> 22:03.496
honestly, will just take you
back to the glory days

22:03.539 --> 22:04.714
and make you forget all about

22:04.758 --> 22:07.587
that stupid and stressful
world out there.

22:07.630 --> 22:08.936
Honestly, it's magic, bro.

22:08.979 --> 22:10.546
- Yeah, I, um...

22:10.590 --> 22:12.722
I just need to check up--

22:17.510 --> 22:18.641
I feel awesome!

22:18.685 --> 22:20.643
- Ah, I knew you would.
- Thank you!

22:20.687 --> 22:21.644
- Hey, I wanted
to ask you something.

22:21.688 --> 22:22.819
- What?

22:22.863 --> 22:24.168
- Why did you and your friends

22:24.212 --> 22:25.561
really end up here
of all places?

22:25.605 --> 22:27.302
- Aww, man, they're cool.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.869
We just wanted to take
your chalice

22:28.912 --> 22:30.436
so we can use
the Loom of Fate.

22:31.741 --> 22:34.527
Are you saying
that the Loombreaker

22:34.570 --> 22:36.442
is a Loom faker?

22:38.661 --> 22:40.489
- Bro,

22:40.533 --> 22:43.579
you're a looker and a cooker.

22:45.146 --> 22:49.498
- Right, but she puts
that Loom together--

22:49.542 --> 22:51.761
mm.

22:51.805 --> 22:54.503
I mean, there goes free will.

22:56.636 --> 22:59.073
There goes the party...

23:00.640 --> 23:04.383
And that is very not tight.

23:08.822 --> 23:11.433
- Our name is Delta Chi Sigma.

23:11.477 --> 23:14.654
- We've assembled
an elite team of women...

23:14.697 --> 23:16.612
To save this campus
from the cliques and cruelty

23:16.656 --> 23:17.918

23:19.615 --> 23:22.662

- And win the Chug Challenge.

Call us Deltas!

23:50.864 --> 23:53.606
- And post.

23:53.649 --> 23:58.306
- All right, we are officially
a part of the Chug Challenge.

23:58.349 --> 24:00.656
- Yeah, this should scare
the competition,

24:00.700 --> 24:03.050
- Yeah, and put us well
on track to using the Loom.

24:03.093 --> 24:06.488
- Okay, I think
this calls for a snack party.

24:06.532 --> 24:07.663
Who wants nachos?

24:07.707 --> 24:09.709
It's my brother's
special recipe.

24:12.146 --> 24:15.671
- Hey, I just wanted
to say thank you.

24:15.715 --> 24:18.152
I've just always been
so focused on

24:18.195 --> 24:20.937
changing the world
at all costs that

24:20.981 --> 24:23.679
I just push people away.

24:23.723 --> 24:26.073
So thanks.

24:26.116 --> 24:28.554
- Oh, I mean,
they're really the ones who...

24:30.947 --> 24:32.471
Thank you.

24:38.259 --> 24:40.609
- Loom or no Loom, at least
some things are changing.

24:40.653 --> 24:43.394
- I can still put a stiletto
through your head,

24:43.438 --> 24:46.223
but your plan does seem
to be working.

24:46.267 --> 24:47.877
I still think
it's the stupidest way

24:47.921 --> 24:49.357
to get what we want, but--

24:55.581 --> 24:57.147
- 'Sup, ladies.

24:57.191 --> 24:59.367
Heard there was a new sorority
on the block,

24:59.410 --> 25:01.891
had to come and hit y'all
with that Big-D welcome.

25:01.935 --> 25:03.371
- What?

25:03.414 --> 25:05.634
You guys tricked out
this place.

25:05.678 --> 25:08.594
Ho!
Gargoyles in sunglasses?

25:08.637 --> 25:10.683
Sick!
So sick!

25:10.726 --> 25:12.772
- Nate, what the hell are you--
- No.

25:12.815 --> 25:14.556
It's Shotgun Nate!

25:14.600 --> 25:16.558
You guys have got
to come to Dion's.

25:16.602 --> 25:19.082
I mean, it makes me wonder
why I ever left college.

25:19.126 --> 25:20.823
- Dionysus has the power
to put people

25:20.867 --> 25:22.608
in a constant state
of ecstasy.

25:22.651 --> 25:24.305
Nate's under his spell.

25:24.348 --> 25:27.569
- You mean Shotgun Nate.

25:27.613 --> 25:30.354
- Yeah, we're gonna go train
for your dumb challenge,

25:30.398 --> 25:31.878
so go bother some other house.

25:31.921 --> 25:34.489
- Oh, right, ugh.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.536
I'm not here just to meet
the new neighbors.

25:37.579 --> 25:40.060
I also wanted to tell you

25:40.103 --> 25:42.715
that you're disqualified
from the Chug Challenges.

25:44.934 --> 25:47.589
There's no way
you're getting that chalice.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.286
- The hell are you on about?

25:49.330 --> 25:51.593
- Well, Shotgun told me why
you're really here.

25:51.637 --> 25:54.683
And the thing is, I just can't
have you using that Loom.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.380
Thing's a total buzzkill.

25:56.424 --> 25:59.122
- We did everything you said,
played by every stupid rule.

25:59.166 --> 26:01.603
You can't just
change them on us now.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.953
- Well, yeah, I can.

26:03.997 --> 26:07.653
I mean, who says that
you have to play fair?

26:07.696 --> 26:09.002
I'm a god!

26:09.045 --> 26:10.873
I just gotta
keep it whimsical, bro!

26:10.917 --> 26:12.440
Let's roll!

26:12.483 --> 26:15.878
all:
Whimsy, whimsy!

26:20.013 --> 26:21.188
- Who was at the door?
- Ugh!

26:21.231 --> 26:22.711
- Oh, what's wrong?

26:22.755 --> 26:24.626
- We're not getting
the chalice, that's what.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.585
- Dion's refusing to let us
participate in the challenges.

26:26.628 --> 26:28.804
He somehow got to Nate,
figured out what we're doing.

26:28.848 --> 26:31.067
- Of course he did.

26:31.111 --> 26:33.156
It's okay.
We will figure this out.

26:33.200 --> 26:36.246
- I am done trying to figure
this out with you people.

26:36.290 --> 26:38.161
I should've done this my way
from the start,

26:38.205 --> 26:40.076
so I'm taking
that chalice by force.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.643
- Look, even if you tried,
that won't work.

26:41.687 --> 26:43.166
You can't defy a god.

26:43.210 --> 26:45.168
- And there is no way you're
using the Loom on your own.

26:45.212 --> 26:48.128
- Being a grown up
sounds weird.

26:48.171 --> 26:49.390
- If I can't get Dion's cup,

26:49.433 --> 26:50.870
I can at least
make him suffer--

26:50.913 --> 26:52.349
him and all his bros,

26:52.393 --> 26:54.482
including your hyp-bro-tized
friend, Nate.

26:54.525 --> 26:56.397
- Hold on a minute.
You can't do that.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.833
We're a sisterhood, remember?

26:57.877 --> 27:00.096
- You can stop feeding me
that line right now.

27:00.140 --> 27:01.402
You pretend we're sisters,

27:01.445 --> 27:03.143
but all you do
is expect me to change.

27:03.186 --> 27:06.015
I'm only your sister
if I become more like you.

27:06.059 --> 27:07.103
- Astra, calm down.
It's not--

27:07.147 --> 27:08.757
- You never listen to my ideas,

27:08.801 --> 27:10.803
and I see how
you all look at me.

27:10.846 --> 27:13.414
I might be new to this,
but that is not sisterhood,

27:13.457 --> 27:15.677
and I am done trying to fit in.

27:21.857 --> 27:23.685
- Hey, got your text.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.861
- Hey.

27:25.905 --> 27:27.167
- Where were you?

27:27.210 --> 27:28.734
- Trying to get you
into this place.

27:28.777 --> 27:30.823
What do you think?

27:30.866 --> 27:32.694
- What?
Dad, how'd you do this?

27:32.738 --> 27:34.696
- Went back in time, donated.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.698
You're as good as in.

27:36.742 --> 27:37.917
- Thank you,

27:37.960 --> 27:39.832
but I didn't really
need a building.

27:39.875 --> 27:42.312
Just needed you here.

27:42.356 --> 27:45.446
- Well, I thought you were
embarrassed to be with me.

27:45.489 --> 27:47.709
I don't belong
with these people.

27:47.753 --> 27:49.232
I didn't wanna ruin
your chances.

27:50.581 --> 27:51.713
- I'm sorry.
It wasn't about you.

27:51.757 --> 27:54.150
I was just ashamed of me.

27:54.194 --> 27:56.109
- What are you talking about?

27:56.152 --> 27:58.154
Don't be stupid.
You're great.

27:58.198 --> 27:59.721
- Yeah, but I don't
belong with them either.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.418
I mean, the only reason
that I survived high school

28:01.462 --> 28:03.682
was because I was imagining
that one day I would get out

28:03.725 --> 28:05.379
and find my people.

28:05.422 --> 28:06.772
They're never gonna
take me as one of them.

28:06.815 --> 28:08.556
I don't really wanna be.

28:08.599 --> 28:11.124
- You don't have to impress
these idiots, these leeches.

28:11.167 --> 28:12.647
You're twice the person
they'll ever be.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.954
- Yeah, but so are you.

28:14.997 --> 28:16.825
I mean, you fought a demon dog.

28:16.869 --> 28:18.305
And these people think
that they're better than us

28:18.348 --> 28:19.915
because they have whales
on their shorts?

28:21.482 --> 28:24.485
What do you say we find a way
to piss off some rich kids?

28:24.528 --> 28:26.574
- I like the sound of that.

28:42.329 --> 28:44.853
- Wait, Astra, no, no, no,
you don't have to do this.

28:44.897 --> 28:45.985
- I am done listening to you.

28:46.028 --> 28:47.334
- Fine,
then don't listen to me.

28:47.377 --> 28:49.205
Listen to yourself.

28:49.249 --> 28:50.816
Come on,
you know this isn't right.

28:50.859 --> 28:52.426
- Yeah, that's the thing.
I don't know that.

28:52.469 --> 28:54.950
Where I'm from,
I had to fight to survive.

28:54.994 --> 28:56.865
This is all I know.
This is what life has made me.

28:56.909 --> 28:58.432
I am not gonna change.

28:58.475 --> 28:59.912
- Hey, no,
we don't want you

28:59.955 --> 29:00.913
to give up who you are.

29:00.956 --> 29:02.828
Look, when I joined
the Legends,

29:02.871 --> 29:04.525
I was a punk, all right?

29:04.568 --> 29:06.353
And there wasn't a rule
that I couldn't break.

29:06.396 --> 29:08.921
And guess what?
I still am.

29:08.964 --> 29:10.313
I just don't need
to hurt people

29:10.357 --> 29:12.794
to survive anymore
because I have them.

29:16.232 --> 29:19.627
- Fine, so I don't
burn down a house,

29:19.670 --> 29:21.760
but what if I never
wanna dress as a moose

29:21.803 --> 29:24.937
or sit through one of your
interminable team meetings?

29:24.980 --> 29:27.330
- Then we still got
a place for you.

29:27.374 --> 29:29.811
- Did you come to party down?

29:29.855 --> 29:32.031
- No, we've come to get
the chalice and you.

29:32.074 --> 29:34.294
Come on, Nate,
you can't stay here.

29:34.337 --> 29:35.686
- Sure I can.

29:35.730 --> 29:36.862
Dion says as long
as he has followers,

29:36.905 --> 29:38.124
he has the power
to run this place

29:38.167 --> 29:40.213
and grant people that cup.

29:40.256 --> 29:42.824
Thought that'd be
useful information for you.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.304
Can't really remember why.

29:44.347 --> 29:47.002
Either way, I'm very
important here, so excuse me.

29:47.046 --> 29:48.221
Shotgun Nate!

29:48.264 --> 29:51.702
all:
Shotgun Nate!

29:51.746 --> 29:53.400
- Wait...

29:55.402 --> 29:58.535
The Olympians feed
off devotion, right?

29:58.579 --> 30:00.755
So that means that Dion
only has his followers

30:00.799 --> 30:04.541
for as long as they worship him
as the party god,

30:04.585 --> 30:08.154
so if we take away all these
followers from him, that's it.

30:08.197 --> 30:09.590
The chalice is released
from his grasp.

30:09.633 --> 30:12.419
- Okay, but the party
isn't slowing down.

30:12.462 --> 30:15.378
- No, but there is one way
to get college kids

30:15.422 --> 30:17.293
to leave a party.

30:17.337 --> 30:18.947
- Oh, wait, no, no, no,
please don't say--

30:18.991 --> 30:21.297
- And that is to throw
an even bigger party,

30:21.341 --> 30:23.169
which means--

30:23.212 --> 30:24.953
- What is wrong
with you people?

30:24.997 --> 30:27.608
- Come on.

30:27.651 --> 30:30.045
The Deltas have got
to out-party Dionysus.

30:30.089 --> 30:31.960
- I am still in Hell, aren't I?

30:32.004 --> 30:34.006
Come on.

30:42.797 --> 30:46.105
- I can't believe it!
Delta's very first house party.

30:46.148 --> 30:48.063
- You know,
I'm actually excited.

30:48.107 --> 30:49.325
I get it now.

30:49.369 --> 30:51.023
Parties aren't
just about getting drunk.

30:51.066 --> 30:52.502
They're about
building community.

30:52.546 --> 30:55.331
- This is so much better
than just some frat party.

30:55.375 --> 30:58.508
- Yeah, it would be
if anyone were here to see it.

30:58.552 --> 30:59.901
- So where is everybody?

30:59.945 --> 31:01.947
- You know what?
I think I know.

31:10.477 --> 31:13.349
- I don't know why we thought
we could out-party Dion.

31:13.393 --> 31:15.047
- You know what?
Let's not give up yet.

31:15.090 --> 31:19.442
- Why not?
We have drinks, games, music.

31:19.486 --> 31:21.705
We did everything
we were supposed to,

31:21.749 --> 31:23.664
and no one came.

31:23.707 --> 31:25.057
- That's right.

31:25.100 --> 31:27.059
We did everything
that we were supposed to.

31:27.102 --> 31:28.930
But maybe we should
ask ourselves--

31:28.974 --> 31:30.932
what would Astra do?

31:33.979 --> 31:35.284
- If you really wanna win,

31:35.328 --> 31:37.286
it is not enough to be good
at your own game.

31:37.330 --> 31:40.115
You also have to take out
the competition,

31:40.159 --> 31:44.206
so I am talking sabotage.

31:44.250 --> 31:46.078
- Yeah.

31:46.121 --> 31:47.601
- All right, what's the plan?

31:47.644 --> 31:49.951
- First, we take Dion
out of play.

31:49.995 --> 31:52.562
Now, I scoped out his place
when I was gonna burn it down,

31:52.606 --> 31:54.260
and I have an idea.

31:54.303 --> 31:56.175
- ♪ Hustle a lot

31:56.218 --> 31:57.524
♪ I'm all I got,
I'm all I got ♪

31:57.567 --> 32:00.092
♪ Busted the ops,
busted the ops ♪

32:00.135 --> 32:01.920
- Ooh, 'sup, Charlie.

32:01.963 --> 32:03.095
- ♪ Snitches get stitches

32:03.138 --> 32:04.792
♪ Money get--

32:04.835 --> 32:06.098
♪ I'm getting millions

32:10.058 --> 32:12.104
- Big-D!
- Yeah.

32:12.147 --> 32:13.975
- Now that I got my team
out of your hair,

32:14.019 --> 32:16.804
how 'bout we get
a fresh keg and celebrate?

32:16.847 --> 32:18.632
- I like how you think,
Shotgun.

32:18.675 --> 32:21.113
- Once he's out,
we mess with his party.

32:21.156 --> 32:22.592
Anything we can do
to kill the vibe.

32:22.636 --> 32:27.728
- Hacking into
Dion's accounts, and...

32:29.034 --> 32:30.122
Bye-bye, party playlist.

32:30.165 --> 32:32.124
- Hey, who cut the music?

32:33.952 --> 32:35.823
What the hell is this?

32:35.866 --> 32:37.825
- Then we take out his booze.

32:39.131 --> 32:42.743
- And this is where
all the magic happens.

32:42.786 --> 32:44.092
- Wow.

32:44.136 --> 32:47.966
So, uh, are these all lagers?

32:49.054 --> 32:50.751
- Whoa.
- I'm sorry, bro.

32:50.794 --> 32:52.622
No hard feelings, yeah?

32:52.666 --> 32:54.102
- Dad, now!

33:05.809 --> 33:08.073
- Now the keg is tapped.

33:08.116 --> 33:11.206
- So final phase--
hijack the party.

33:12.773 --> 33:16.037
- Hey, guys, I heard there's
a rager at Delta Chi Sigma.

33:21.782 --> 33:23.697
- So what we waiting for?

33:23.740 --> 33:25.307
Let's go party.

33:25.351 --> 33:27.570
- ♪ Hands in the air

33:27.614 --> 33:29.442
♪ Move it all around,
shake your derriere ♪

33:29.485 --> 33:32.184
- Gotta say it, you Legends
do know how to party.

33:32.227 --> 33:35.361
- Rory, are you able
to lift the chalice yet?

33:35.404 --> 33:37.972
It's still not giving.

33:38.016 --> 33:41.628
- That doesn't make sense.
All of his followers are here.

33:43.238 --> 33:45.153
- Cool little trick
you pulled back there.

33:45.197 --> 33:47.895
Gotta appreciate a good stunt.

33:47.938 --> 33:49.157
Still, I heard
there was a party

33:49.201 --> 33:52.639
that I wasn't invited to,
and that hurts.

33:52.682 --> 33:54.380
- We're getting
that chalice, Dion.

33:54.423 --> 33:56.469
- Well, as long
as I have my followers,

33:56.512 --> 33:59.298
my Chug Cup
isn't going anywhere,

33:59.341 --> 34:01.169
and bros are bros for life.

34:01.213 --> 34:02.997
Bros are bros for life!

34:03.041 --> 34:06.218
Bros are bros for life!
Bros are bros for life!

34:06.261 --> 34:07.219
Bros are bros for life!

34:07.262 --> 34:08.220
- Hey!

34:09.786 --> 34:12.267
Your reign
on this campus is over.

34:12.311 --> 34:16.097
I challenge you to beer pong.

34:19.579 --> 34:21.102
- Ooh.

34:21.146 --> 34:23.278
- You do know I'm undefeated

34:23.322 --> 34:26.107
in all my years on campus,
right?

34:26.151 --> 34:29.284
- Yeah, but it might
be pretty hard

34:29.328 --> 34:32.113
to hold on
to all your followers

34:32.157 --> 34:35.421
once they watch me
demolish you.

34:35.464 --> 34:36.900
- Ooh.

34:36.944 --> 34:39.903
- So come on, D-Bag.

34:41.818 --> 34:43.255
What do you say?

34:43.298 --> 34:47.737
Winner takes all,
Dartmouth rules.

34:47.781 --> 34:50.392
-  Well,

34:50.436 --> 34:52.612
you know I can't say no
to a challenge.

34:54.179 --> 34:57.617
Hmm, stupid whimsy.
You're on.

34:57.660 --> 35:00.968
But if I win,

35:01.011 --> 35:03.231
Delta house gets shut down.

35:05.451 --> 35:09.281
No sorority and no Chug Cup.

35:12.371 --> 35:13.676
- You sure about this, babe?

35:13.720 --> 35:15.374
'Cause, you know,
you can't see.

35:15.417 --> 35:18.028
- Oh, I've played
some beer pong in my life,

35:18.072 --> 35:20.161
and plus superpowers, remember?

35:22.207 --> 35:24.209
- The game is beer pong.

35:26.211 --> 35:28.778
Now, sink a ball into a cup
and the other player drinks it,

35:28.822 --> 35:32.260
and to make it even more fun,
body saves are fair game.

35:33.479 --> 35:35.481
So remember, everybody,
the first player

35:35.524 --> 35:38.353
to clear the other's cups
takes it all.

35:38.397 --> 35:41.313
Now, opponents,
please shake hands.

35:43.402 --> 35:45.186
- May the best player win.

35:49.321 --> 35:50.844
- Whatever.

35:59.287 --> 36:00.941
- ♪ What y'all drinking on?

36:02.421 --> 36:04.118
♪ And can you give me some?

36:04.162 --> 36:06.729
♪ Sip it so quickly
you can hardly blink ♪

36:06.773 --> 36:08.340
- And pong!

36:10.690 --> 36:12.735

36:12.779 --> 36:14.215

Oh!

36:48.989 --> 36:50.773

- Whoo!

36:52.035 --> 36:53.472
- This point wins it.

36:57.432 --> 37:00.305
- All right, let's do this.

37:00.348 --> 37:01.654
Whoo!

37:22.152 --> 37:24.198
- Whoa.
- Oh!

37:30.335 --> 37:32.293
- I'm sorry, dude.

37:33.990 --> 37:35.383
- Our winner!

37:37.080 --> 37:38.517
- We gotta give it to her.

37:38.560 --> 37:41.128
- Wait, wait, wait,
what happened to bros for life?

37:41.171 --> 37:42.260
- I--

37:43.522 --> 37:45.306
- Come on,
I know you wanna say it.

37:45.350 --> 37:47.134
- Aw.
- I will not.

37:47.177 --> 37:48.135
- Aw.

37:48.178 --> 37:49.136
- Then I will.

37:49.179 --> 37:50.355
Go...

37:50.398 --> 37:52.226
Sisters!

37:52.270 --> 37:53.227
- Whoo!

37:54.924 --> 37:56.361
- Huh?

37:57.536 --> 37:58.319
- Got your cup.

37:58.363 --> 38:01.148
- Yay!
- Yeah!

38:03.455 --> 38:05.283
- Best father-daughter
weekend ever.

38:15.989 --> 38:18.208
- I can't believe
that actually worked.

38:18.252 --> 38:19.688
- Yeah, you'll get used to it.

38:19.732 --> 38:21.864
- We couldn't have done it
without the three of you.

38:21.908 --> 38:23.388
- Yeah, thanks
for sticking with us

38:23.431 --> 38:24.476
even when
we were right gits.

38:24.519 --> 38:26.652
- It's been real, ladies.

38:26.695 --> 38:29.045
I'm sorry this chapter
of Delta Chi Sigma

38:29.089 --> 38:30.569
has to come to an end.

38:30.612 --> 38:31.570
- Oh, it's not over.

38:31.613 --> 38:33.267
We're gonna keep
Delta house going.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.703
- What?

38:34.747 --> 38:37.053
- After the party, I applied
for a house on Greek row.

38:37.097 --> 38:38.490
- Fitting in is hard enough--

38:38.533 --> 38:41.449
so many people telling you
what to do and what to wear.

38:41.493 --> 38:42.668
Now there's a space for people

38:42.711 --> 38:44.539
to figure it out
for themselves

38:44.583 --> 38:45.584
thanks to you guys.

38:45.627 --> 38:48.891
- I get it.
You're welcome.

38:48.935 --> 38:50.066
- All right, ladies--

38:50.110 --> 38:51.372
- Oy.
- What?

38:51.416 --> 38:53.287
- One for the road?

38:53.331 --> 38:54.419
Deltas!

38:56.551 --> 38:57.596
- Bye, sisters.
- Aww.

38:57.639 --> 38:59.249
- Bye!
- Gonna miss you!

38:59.293 --> 39:01.469
- Just say no to drugs, kids.
- Don't do it.

39:01.513 --> 39:03.515
-  Youth.
- It's not worth it.

39:03.558 --> 39:05.343
- I need a nap.

39:09.651 --> 39:11.610
- You guys earned
the good stuff.

39:11.653 --> 39:14.047
You won the chalice,
and with it,

39:14.090 --> 39:16.310
immortality for a day.

39:16.354 --> 39:19.139
- All right,
guess it's time to chug.

39:22.447 --> 39:24.405
To Behrad,

39:24.449 --> 39:26.668
and to your mum.

39:28.627 --> 39:30.019
Well,

39:30.063 --> 39:33.501
it's actually quite a lot
of responsibility, really.

39:33.545 --> 39:35.068
And that is a lot of wine.

39:35.111 --> 39:37.723
- Why don't we all
just drink from it?

39:37.766 --> 39:39.551
I mean, who said there only
has to be three fates, right?

39:39.594 --> 39:40.987
- Yeah, we could all
use the Loom together.

39:41.030 --> 39:42.510
- Yeah, you're not alone
in this, love.

39:42.554 --> 39:44.599
- Yeah, immortality
sounds pretty epic.

39:44.643 --> 39:46.035
- Let's drink.

39:47.428 --> 39:49.430
- Let's all do it then.
- Yeah.

39:59.440 --> 40:00.441
Wow.

40:02.051 --> 40:04.227
Yeah, I'm not gonna drink--
super haram--

40:04.271 --> 40:07.579
but I trust all of you
to bring my baby brother back.

40:12.366 --> 40:13.976
- Here goes nothing.

40:16.109 --> 40:18.067
- Oy.

40:24.726 --> 40:26.772
- Mm.

40:28.687 --> 40:30.645
- That's it.

40:31.211 --> 40:33.605
- Well, not exactly, bro.

40:39.524 --> 40:42.875
- Oh, wow, you are all glowing.

40:44.093 --> 40:46.487
- Oh, must be the moisturizer
you recommended.

40:46.531 --> 40:47.793
Like, my skin feels tighter.

40:47.836 --> 40:49.490
- Mm-mm, literally--
you're literally glowing.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.710
- Guys, we did it.

40:51.753 --> 40:53.581
- Whoo, whoo!

40:53.625 --> 40:56.149
Come on, let's go
and use that Loom!

40:56.192 --> 40:57.542
- And remember,

40:57.585 --> 41:00.719
no looming anything
that'll ruin my party.

41:00.762 --> 41:03.983
Not that you would, Clotho.
I can tell you're still chill.

41:04.026 --> 41:04.984
- That's right.

41:05.027 --> 41:06.638
- Later days, Shotgun.

41:06.681 --> 41:07.987
Later days, Dion!

41:08.030 --> 41:10.729
- You guys got some
trippy art here.

41:10.772 --> 41:12.644
This cane was yelling at me.

41:12.687 --> 41:15.385
- Yeah, I'll take
that nice one, love.

41:15.429 --> 41:17.562
- Sounds like someone's had
too much to drink.

41:17.605 --> 41:19.738
Let's get you outta here.

41:19.781 --> 41:22.131
all: Bye.

41:29.269 --> 41:30.313
- Hello, traitor.

41:35.362 --> 41:37.451
Just the woman I wanted to see.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.539
- Don't bother
trying to win me back.

41:38.583 --> 41:40.280
I don't need you anymore.

41:40.323 --> 41:42.848
- When you asked for my help
killing John Constantine,

41:42.891 --> 41:46.155
I warned you
you would be in my debt.

41:46.199 --> 41:48.723
Well, honey,
I'm calling in the favor.

42:15.794 --> 42:16.882
- Greg, move your head.
