00:15.849 --> 00:17.642
[Ellia] I don't care
if you've lost your mind,

00:17.726 --> 00:19.477
it's still your job to get me to the lake.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.855
I have not lost my mind,
we are in my mind.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.566
‐I think.
‐[Ellia coughs]

00:24.649 --> 00:25.984
This is the C pill.

00:26.067 --> 00:27.277
It's confrontation.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.363
-Annia, I'm concerned this madness is--
-I am not mad.

00:30.947 --> 00:32.574
We are in a globular cluster.

00:32.991 --> 00:33.825
Okay?

00:33.908 --> 00:35.952
So, you're telling me

00:36.036 --> 00:39.330
you believe that
this is not the real world.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.249
That some other world, your world,

00:41.332 --> 00:44.085
is the true world,
and that I'm confused who I am

00:44.169 --> 00:47.964
as is every other elf, human,
orc, dwarf,

00:48.048 --> 00:50.425
-hobgoblin, wraithling--
-Oh, my fucking God. Don't list them.

00:50.508 --> 00:53.219
The entire world's mad, but you're not.

00:54.804 --> 00:56.181
Is that what you think?

00:57.015 --> 00:57.974
Yes.

00:59.350 --> 01:02.604
The other way around's more likely,
isn't it, Annia?

01:04.272 --> 01:05.982
This is the place that's real.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.568
Someone has cast a spell on you.

01:08.943 --> 01:10.612
And it will wear off soon.

01:10.695 --> 01:12.030
And if it doesn't,

01:12.489 --> 01:15.158
then maybe the Lake of the Clouds
can heal you too.

What?

02:02.831 --> 02:04.666
[Olivia] I lost you there for a second.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.502
What were you thinkin' about?

02:09.462 --> 02:10.880
I ain't slept in a week.

02:12.632 --> 02:13.883
When's this test?

02:14.425 --> 02:16.761
You've gotta stop it
with the all-nighters, Owen.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.514
[thunder rumbling]

02:20.181 --> 02:22.725
Have you ever heard of the Gnostics?

02:24.769 --> 02:29.399
Is that when you're not sure
if God exists, like not quite an atheist?

02:30.066 --> 02:30.942
No.

02:32.485 --> 02:35.572
Jesus' disciples,
they all wrote gospels, right?

02:38.324 --> 02:40.702
But they didn't all
make it into the Bible.

02:42.412 --> 02:43.997
The church only wanted the ones

02:44.080 --> 02:46.624
that told the story
they were trying to tell.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.252
I didn't know that.

02:49.752 --> 02:51.921
Well, same goes for all history.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.382
Same goes for your brain.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.134
What do you mean?

02:57.927 --> 02:59.137
Our brains are just...

02:59.512 --> 03:02.390
computers that make
our life stories make sense.

03:05.643 --> 03:07.228
You know what, Owen? You...

03:07.812 --> 03:11.024
are the perfect example
of never judging a book by its cover.

03:11.482 --> 03:12.317
Why is that?

03:12.775 --> 03:14.777
You know, the tattoos.

03:16.404 --> 03:17.780
You look like a tough guy.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.742
But you think about the world.

03:20.825 --> 03:22.410
What, tough guys don't think?

03:22.493 --> 03:23.620
Not usually.

03:24.954 --> 03:26.497
My last boyfriend, he was...

03:26.915 --> 03:27.874
into, you know...

03:28.541 --> 03:30.168
criminal enterprises.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.880
Kind of made him go crazy.

03:33.963 --> 03:36.299
He lost his shit
and he started getting all paranoid

03:36.382 --> 03:38.301
that I was workin' for the FBI,

03:38.384 --> 03:41.262
and informin' on him
and recording our conversations.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.722
I wasn't doin' any of that.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.684
Sounds like
he was under a lot of pressure.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.605
And then he really flipped out on me.

03:51.856 --> 03:54.859
He started screamin' at my face,
throwin' things...

03:55.318 --> 03:57.278
dumpin' out my purse, doing...

03:58.988 --> 04:01.157
horrible stuff to me, it was terrifying.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.620
[thunder rumbling]

04:05.703 --> 04:07.247
Did he ever apologize?

04:09.332 --> 04:10.208
No.

04:12.627 --> 04:15.255
Actually, that's the last time
I ever heard from him.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.178
Maybe he wanted to apologize but...

04:23.846 --> 04:25.807
he felt too ashamed to do it.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.936
Maybe it was easier for him just to...

04:32.397 --> 04:34.232
pretend like it didn't even happen.

04:39.487 --> 04:42.657
People can go their whole lives
pretending things didn't happen.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.327
Otherwise, they'd have to admit
they're to blame

04:46.411 --> 04:47.996
for everything wrong in their lives.

04:48.621 --> 04:51.833
I think sometimes there's too much guilt
for one person to bear.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.546
Why are you in school?

04:57.672 --> 05:01.009
You already know about
Gnostics and Magellan.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.594
'Cause I want somethin' different.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.182
We got that in common.

05:09.517 --> 05:10.977
So what do you want, then?

05:13.938 --> 05:16.316
People are always askin' me
to model, right?

05:17.233 --> 05:18.443
So, do that then.

05:19.027 --> 05:22.989
With my chronic hypothermia,
my family says I shouldn't.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.451
I'm more useful to them at home,

05:27.201 --> 05:29.412
especially in the winter. [chuckles]

05:29.495 --> 05:32.707
For people who are supposed
to love unconditionally...

05:35.043 --> 05:37.712
families seem to have a lot of conditions.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.302
One day I wanna make
a family with no conditions.

05:47.305 --> 05:48.973
Maybe that's all I really want.

05:52.643 --> 05:54.771
Talking to you is really easy, Olivia.

05:58.941 --> 05:59.984
You too, Owen.

06:27.011 --> 06:29.222
You see, she was telling the truth.

06:29.764 --> 06:32.016
If there was no lake,
why would we have found the tree?

06:32.100 --> 06:34.102
No, it's just part of the con.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.605
Someone must have told fur lady
how I do it.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.190
I bring them here,

06:39.273 --> 06:41.484
I wow them with the Burning Tree,

06:41.567 --> 06:44.237
and I tell them to look
for the invisible moon, but...

06:44.612 --> 06:47.657
they can't see it
because there isn't one and so...

06:48.157 --> 06:48.991
magic!

06:49.075 --> 06:50.952
[gasps] I can see it.

06:51.536 --> 06:52.412
Have a look.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.872
There obviously isn't...

06:58.876 --> 06:59.877
the moon.

07:03.631 --> 07:04.882
Can you see it, too?

07:05.716 --> 07:06.551
Yeah.

07:08.469 --> 07:11.639
I don't usually even
bring people that way.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.141
[Ellia] Come along.

07:17.645 --> 07:18.479
God.

07:43.754 --> 07:46.674
[Porter] Hey, Ron, make sure you put
those tennis shoes in the furnace.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.843
Let's roll out that periwinkle cuff.

07:48.926 --> 07:50.845
-It's kind of calm.
-How'd those new pills work?

07:50.928 --> 07:52.722
-You sleep any better?
-No.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.932
No? Try the red ones next time.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.518
Talk to me if you need somethin' else.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.439
Well, I found the rat.

08:03.816 --> 08:04.901
Your own brother.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.195
Can you fuckin' believe it?

08:10.281 --> 08:11.657
Aah, I'm slippin'.

08:12.116 --> 08:13.743
No way Rick was the rat.

08:14.410 --> 08:15.953
What the fuck were you doin'?

08:16.037 --> 08:18.414
Oh, by the way, I've got this new system.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.373
Okay?

08:20.124 --> 08:23.294
When you're finished,
you put it directly into the charger,

08:23.920 --> 08:27.298
and then when you need a new one,
you take it out, you put it in the drill.

08:27.381 --> 08:28.841
That way, you never--

08:28.925 --> 08:31.177
You have no idea what's goin' on, do you?

08:32.720 --> 08:35.181
You never had
a fuckin' sixth-sense superpower.

08:37.350 --> 08:41.020
Have you ever considered that,
despite all your problems here...

08:42.146 --> 08:44.857
it's likely that you are currently trapped

08:45.316 --> 08:47.026
inside a malfunctioning

08:47.527 --> 08:50.696
and extremely dangerous simulation,

08:51.280 --> 08:53.074
which is, in itself, directed

08:53.157 --> 08:55.826
by a suicidally depressed
consciousness?

08:58.871 --> 08:59.705
Why?

09:01.457 --> 09:03.960
<i>Ceci n'est pas une</i> fucking <i>drill.</i>

09:08.047 --> 09:08.881
So...

09:10.925 --> 09:13.553
What are you gonna do
about protecting the family?

09:15.638 --> 09:18.140
I ain't crazy,
and I ain't gonna say that I am.

09:20.768 --> 09:24.564
You are failing the big test.

09:27.858 --> 09:29.068
[Ellia] <i>I did have a sister.</i>

09:29.777 --> 09:31.112
[Annia] What was she like?

09:32.321 --> 09:33.406
[Ellia] I hated to...

09:33.781 --> 09:35.283
get clean when I was little.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.118
There was the day...

09:37.994 --> 09:38.911
in the river.

09:40.037 --> 09:42.290
We built a dam with wolf pups.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.793
The Derglassian brothers,

09:47.753 --> 09:49.755
from the farm two miles up the road.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.512
And by the end, we were...

09:57.555 --> 10:00.141
covered in mud and...

10:00.766 --> 10:01.976
and clay, and...

10:02.685 --> 10:04.228
[chuckling] And dog hair.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.897
And Mother was there.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.109
And she just looked at the both of us...

10:10.735 --> 10:11.569
and said...

10:12.236 --> 10:15.489
"I'm the mother of two filthy...

10:17.366 --> 10:18.284
roaches.

10:18.743 --> 10:19.619
I will...

10:20.536 --> 10:21.996
drown you both...

10:22.622 --> 10:25.041
before you set foot in this house."

10:25.791 --> 10:27.293
She was in that sundress.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.129
Havin' a day.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.425
Then you ran away.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.803
Did I ever tell you
what she said to me after?

10:38.471 --> 10:39.430
No.

10:40.598 --> 10:43.059
She asked me
why hadn't I run away as well?

10:43.809 --> 10:45.645
And I said it was out of respect.

10:47.271 --> 10:50.858
Even though, really, it was
because I was more afraid than you.

10:52.234 --> 10:55.112
She swiped her finger across my forehead

10:55.488 --> 10:57.573
and asked what she'd done

10:57.657 --> 10:59.867
to deserve a daughter like me.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.995
And I asked her what she meant.

11:04.330 --> 11:08.209
And she said, "Utterly and predictably...

11:08.709 --> 11:09.585
normal."

11:14.173 --> 11:15.841
Well, it's better than being hit.

[Adelaide] <i>If we move now,</i>

‐You think, uh...

your dad knew something?

-What?
-[Adelaide] I mean your brother, Rick.

That's who your dad thought it was, right?

-I'm the rat.
-Yeah, but there could be others.

12:12.565 --> 12:13.941

13:37.858 --> 13:39.401
The fifth Milgrim boy.

13:40.569 --> 13:44.073
Shunned, abandoned,
black sheep, prodigal son.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.741
Lying fucking eyes. Huh.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.786
Dad never told you.

13:49.119 --> 13:51.914
He said he got rid of you
'cause you were an un-loyal baby.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.332
That's why Dad's a genius.

13:53.874 --> 13:56.168
It wasn't because of that.

13:57.127 --> 13:59.797
It's because he...
he needed a cop with the bloodline.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.467
[chuckles] Do you wanna know why, Owen?

14:06.053 --> 14:07.638
Because nothing trumps blood.

14:08.722 --> 14:11.392
At least‐‐
Yeah, at least, I thought so...

14:12.226 --> 14:13.894
I've watched you my whole life.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.357
I wanna be you.

14:19.900 --> 14:20.985
[chuckles]

14:22.486 --> 14:23.404
I love you.

14:25.531 --> 14:26.657
Owen, the prince.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.328
It ain't that great being me, dude.

14:36.166 --> 14:38.377
What? You... you sad about her?

14:40.754 --> 14:43.924
[clears throat]
Yeah, it's 'cause she's attractive.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.511
I was gonna marry her.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.473
Why the fuck you shoot her, then?

14:54.435 --> 14:55.895
Blood trumps cock, right?

14:55.978 --> 14:57.563
Oh! Fuck.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.065
Need to stretch more--

15:00.149 --> 15:01.275
What are you doing he-- Fuck!

15:08.741 --> 15:10.075
Brilliantly played, Owen.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.411
Thanks for the breadcrumbs.

15:14.538 --> 15:15.372
Is she dead?

15:16.415 --> 15:18.334
-Yeah.
-Shame.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.378
There's some spare shirts in the car.

15:38.729 --> 15:41.941
[Owen] <i>This whole time, you've just been</i>
<i>a motherfuckin' fed, dude.</i>

15:42.483 --> 15:44.693
[Frank] <i>I've been undercover</i>
<i>for 36 years now.</i>

15:44.777 --> 15:46.236
‐[honks]
‐Are you fucking kidding me?

15:46.320 --> 15:47.196
Fucking moron!

15:48.614 --> 15:50.366
[Frank] <i>So we're gonna need you</i>
<i>to testify.</i>

15:50.449 --> 15:52.409
<i>We'll put in you into witness relocation.</i>

15:53.327 --> 15:57.039
[Owen] <i>I wanna bring someone with me</i>
<i>when I go into witness relocation.</i>

16:04.296 --> 16:06.382
Luigi, there wasn't
supposed to be bacon on that.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.968
Also, there's a hair in this.
Is this table number nine?

16:09.051 --> 16:10.302
-Hey.
-Owen.

16:10.386 --> 16:13.138
-I'm leaving.
-Leaving? I didn't know you were here.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.473
Why is there blood on your face?

16:14.890 --> 16:16.809
You need to do somethin' different, right?

16:17.226 --> 16:18.060
Yeah.

16:18.143 --> 16:20.479
You wanna see the world, do stuff, right?

16:20.854 --> 16:21.814
Yeah.

16:22.481 --> 16:23.357
So, come with me.

16:24.483 --> 16:25.317
Where?

16:26.235 --> 16:28.112
They'll give us both brand-new identities.

16:28.195 --> 16:30.280
‐Who? Who will?
‐[knocking]

16:31.448 --> 16:32.408
The FBI.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.578
-No, I can't... I can't go with you.
-Is this her?

16:37.621 --> 16:39.373
‐I'm not done yet.
-You comin', hon, or what?

16:39.456 --> 16:41.417
‐Who is this guy?
-I'm Frank. Who the fuck are you?

16:41.500 --> 16:44.336
Hey, don't fuckin' talk to her like that,
you understand?

16:47.089 --> 16:49.425
There are so many reasons to say no.

16:50.384 --> 16:52.177
You asked me what I wanted.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.471
And I said something different.

16:55.639 --> 16:56.849
Marry me.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.061
Hey, I wan't you to marry me, Olivia.

17:02.229 --> 17:03.856
I fuckin' love you.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.066
No conditions?

17:07.693 --> 17:08.861
No conditions.

17:13.699 --> 17:14.533
Okay.

17:14.616 --> 17:16.201
-Okay?
-Yeah, okay.

17:16.285 --> 17:18.370
-Hey, she fuckin' said yes!
<i>-Mazel tov!</i>

17:18.454 --> 17:20.456
My motherfuckin' superpower is love!

17:26.045 --> 17:27.254
[Olivia] Asia, stop it!

17:27.337 --> 17:29.590
-[children yelling]
-Antarctica, just grab this.

17:29.965 --> 17:32.676
Africa, enough with the glue!
We don't have to scream like that.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.680
Australia. Australia, stop it, please.
Stop it.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.183
-That's ridiculous.
-I asked him whether or not--

17:39.975 --> 17:42.269
Don't, Africa. I see you, okay?

17:43.812 --> 17:44.855
Stop it!

17:44.938 --> 17:47.483
Australia, enough. Enough with the drum!

17:47.566 --> 17:48.484
<i>Utangátta!</i>

17:51.403 --> 17:53.489
We had a pretty good life, you know.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.324
[baby cries] But I realized last night...

18:02.247 --> 18:03.415
none of it matters.

18:06.543 --> 18:08.504
I ain't supposed to be here with y'all.

18:09.838 --> 18:12.382
I can't be the person
I'm supposed to be here.

18:16.595 --> 18:17.930
Goodbye, everybody.

18:18.013 --> 18:18.931
What?

18:19.056 --> 18:20.349
I'm sorry.

18:20.432 --> 18:23.310
-[child] What does he mean by--
-Owen. What--

18:23.393 --> 18:25.437
-Dad? Dad, no!
-[children screaming]

18:28.357 --> 18:30.734
[Annie] <i>...look out for each other,</i>
<i>remember?</i>

18:34.655 --> 18:36.198
<i>You made a promise to me.</i>

18:36.615 --> 18:38.742
<i>And you made a promise to yourself.</i>

18:39.493 --> 18:42.496
<i>We promised we'd look out for each other,</i>
<i>remember?</i>

18:47.167 --> 18:48.669
<i>You made a promise to me.</i>

18:49.378 --> 18:51.421
<i>And you made a promise to yourself.</i>

18:52.047 --> 18:54.967
<i>We promised we'd look out for each other,</i>
<i>remember?</i>

18:56.135 --> 18:58.262
[Olivia] Don't you think
you're being a little dramatic?

19:01.515 --> 19:02.808
[Annie] <i>You made a promise to me.</i>

19:02.891 --> 19:05.310
You're really gonna leave me here
with seven children?

19:06.353 --> 19:09.439
[Annie] <i>We promised</i>
<i>we'd look out for each other, remember?</i>

19:09.523 --> 19:11.358
I know where I'm supposed to be now.

19:15.028 --> 19:16.572
[Annie] <i>You made a promise to me.</i>

19:17.156 --> 19:19.199
<i>And you made a promise to yourself.</i>

19:19.950 --> 19:22.911
<i>We promised we'd look out for each other,</i>
<i>remember?</i>

19:22.995 --> 19:24.288
[whirring sound]

19:25.706 --> 19:27.708
[screeching]

19:33.714 --> 19:35.382
[Owen] <i>Annie, I'm coming for you!</i>

19:44.224 --> 19:45.809
<i>This place goes on forever!</i>

19:50.189 --> 19:51.648
<i>Annie, where are you?</i>

19:51.732 --> 19:52.691
[screeches]

19:52.774 --> 19:54.776
[screeching echoes]

19:57.696 --> 19:59.031
<i>Annie, I'm a hawk!</i>

20:04.786 --> 20:06.788
[wind whistling]

20:42.491 --> 20:43.450
[Ellia] This is it.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.078
This is the place.

20:47.829 --> 20:48.789
Where I died.

20:49.915 --> 20:50.916
I don't want to see.

20:54.461 --> 20:55.379
You have to look.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.008
This is how you move on.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.347
[whispers] And it's time to say goodbye.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.851
-I can't say goodbye to you.
-You have to.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.436
-I can't.
-You have to.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.440
[static crackling]

21:15.732 --> 21:17.818
[Greta] <i>It doesn't matter what they want.</i>

21:17.901 --> 21:21.655
I'm here with you now, and right now,
it's all about what you want.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.324
Which is to say, what I want.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.204
What I really need is a friend.

21:31.915 --> 21:34.334
And I think you could use one too.

21:34.584 --> 21:35.919
[chuckles]

21:37.462 --> 21:38.297
I...

21:39.506 --> 21:40.549
fell in love.

21:41.758 --> 21:43.760
And‐‐ and then I lost...

21:44.177 --> 21:45.429
Robert, and...

21:45.887 --> 21:46.763
and I don't‐‐

21:47.097 --> 21:50.600
I don't know how, I don't know how I can--
how I can‐‐

21:50.684 --> 21:52.102
Oh! [laughs]

21:52.185 --> 21:55.022
Oh! So many new emotions.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.649
One minute, I feel like I'm gonna cry,

21:57.733 --> 22:00.736
and the next minute
I feel like I wanna help everybody,

22:00.819 --> 22:04.197
and then the next, I wanna do
as much damage as possible.

22:04.698 --> 22:05.615
[chuckles]

22:06.825 --> 22:10.120
Well, that's a little over the top,
don't you think, all in all?

22:12.456 --> 22:16.418
This is all your hysteria, Greta.

22:17.419 --> 22:18.503
It's all you.

22:19.504 --> 22:20.380
So...

22:20.672 --> 22:23.508
So, what, thi-- thi--
this woman with the legs

22:23.592 --> 22:26.845
thinks she can slap a few toddler emotions
into a Speak &amp; Spell

22:26.928 --> 22:28.805
and create a mind, my mind?

22:28.889 --> 22:33.435
You describe your feelings
as toddler emotions?

22:33.518 --> 22:35.520
You're a machine, a computer.

22:36.521 --> 22:38.398
How much of me can actually be in there?

22:38.482 --> 22:41.276
I'm detecting
a great deal of anger from you, Greta.

22:44.821 --> 22:45.697
James? James.

22:50.410 --> 22:52.162
James, let me out!

22:54.706 --> 22:56.083
-[screams] Jamie!
-[gasps]

22:57.667 --> 23:02.047
James. James. James, James, James!

23:02.130 --> 23:05.008
James, James! Oh! Oh! Oh!

23:05.967 --> 23:07.177
What's a McMurphy?

23:09.262 --> 23:10.097
Uh...

23:11.473 --> 23:12.808
[Owen] <i>What is this place?</i>

23:13.392 --> 23:14.393
<i>Beautiful!</i>

23:15.727 --> 23:17.187

[hawk screeches]

23:19.314 --> 23:20.816
[screeching echoes]

23:23.777 --> 23:24.653
The Queen.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.161
It's her.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.914
-You have to say goodbye right now.
-No.

23:35.997 --> 23:37.374
-You have to.
-No!

23:37.457 --> 23:40.502
You shouldn't ever have to say goodbye.

23:40.961 --> 23:44.256
I have a deal for you, Annie,
if you're interested.

23:44.339 --> 23:49.261
What if I said you never had
to return to your drab, gray life?

23:49.344 --> 23:54.307
All that obsession with knowing
who you are, knowing yourself...

23:54.391 --> 23:57.436
True bliss is not knowing who you are.

23:58.728 --> 24:00.564
True bliss is staying here.

24:01.106 --> 24:03.108
That's what I have to offer.

24:03.191 --> 24:05.360
[hawk calls]

24:05.444 --> 24:07.946
[Owen] Annie, it's me, Owen, as a hawk!

24:08.488 --> 24:10.240
I haven't forgotten,
we'll protect each--

24:10.323 --> 24:12.200
[screeches]

24:12.284 --> 24:13.743
She's lying. Don't make a deal with--

24:13.827 --> 24:15.704
[screeches]

24:15.787 --> 24:18.707
We'll just send him back
to the Globular Cluster.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.084
[hawk screeches]

24:21.168 --> 24:23.795
[Owen screams]

24:23.879 --> 24:25.005
[splash]

24:26.339 --> 24:28.758
What if I said
you could stay here with us?

24:29.718 --> 24:30.802
Forever and ever.

24:31.386 --> 24:33.138
Stay with your sister.

24:33.221 --> 24:35.974
Don't do this again.
You wanna move on. Just say goodbye.

24:36.057 --> 24:37.893
No. No.

24:46.610 --> 24:47.819
[engine starts]

24:54.451 --> 24:56.369
Wait. Wait, what about Ellie?

24:57.996 --> 24:58.914
Ellie!

25:00.540 --> 25:01.750
No! No!

25:02.042 --> 25:03.627
Wait! Wait!

25:04.836 --> 25:05.754
Ellie!

25:05.837 --> 25:07.339
No, please wait!

25:07.422 --> 25:09.007
[banging on door]

25:09.090 --> 25:11.092
No! Ellie! Ellie!

25:12.219 --> 25:13.929
Ellie! Ellie!

25:18.725 --> 25:21.895
[Queen] I'm sorry, you misunderstood.

25:21.978 --> 25:25.065
<i>This is an exclusive deal.</i>

25:26.107 --> 25:29.819
<i>We'll be together forever.</i>
