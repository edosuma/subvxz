00:45.021 --> 00:46.522
[roaring]

00:50.484 --> 00:52.486
[reporter] We have just received
an anonymous tip

00:52.570 --> 00:55.782
informing us that the giant fugitive ape,
known as Kong,

00:55.865 --> 00:59.535
has been sighted heading back towards
the scene of his first violent crimes,

00:59.618 --> 01:01.162
Alcatraz Island.

01:01.245 --> 01:03.456
No sign of the monster gorilla as yet.

01:03.539 --> 01:06.500
But we can see the acclaimed
scientist and philanthropist,

01:06.584 --> 01:08.002
Dr. Richard Remy, who...

01:08.086 --> 01:09.628
- [Kong roars]
- [reporter] Oh, no!

01:10.588 --> 01:13.257
Kong! Please, no!

01:14.300 --> 01:15.885
[Kong roaring]

01:18.930 --> 01:20.639
[roaring]

01:23.684 --> 01:25.478
No!

01:29.398 --> 01:31.317
- [grunts]
- [pterodactyls screeching]

01:34.445 --> 01:36.114
[reporter] We have just witnessed
a vicious,

01:36.197 --> 01:41.202
unprovoked attack on Dr. Richard Remy,
who only narrowly escaped with his life.

01:41.285 --> 01:42.871
Thankfully, once again,

01:42.954 --> 01:47.208
Dr. Remy's bionobots have saved the day
and thwarted the savage ape.

01:47.291 --> 01:50.837
But what everyone, especially the police,
want to know is...

01:50.920 --> 01:55.967
where are Kong and his nefarious master,
Lukas Remy, hiding.

01:56.050 --> 01:58.677
[sighs] I'd like to know
where the heck Kong is, too.

01:58.762 --> 01:59.763
Has anyone seen him?

01:59.846 --> 02:02.265
I didn't even know Kong left.

02:02.348 --> 02:04.768
I saw him duck out just before sunrise.

02:04.851 --> 02:06.811
I can't believe Kong
would go back to the island

02:06.895 --> 02:08.437
to try to finish off Richard.

02:08.520 --> 02:09.646
I can't either...

02:09.731 --> 02:11.816
except we just saw it
with our own eyes.

02:13.442 --> 02:14.778
[grunting happily]

02:14.861 --> 02:17.989
Kong, your attack on Richard
is all over the news.

02:18.072 --> 02:19.407
What do you think you're doing?

02:19.490 --> 02:22.201
[confused grunting]

02:22.285 --> 02:25.038
Come on, bro,
we saw you on the island.

02:25.121 --> 02:28.374
[grunting]

02:28.457 --> 02:30.334
He says he didn't leave the Redwoods.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.879
Bawk! Pants on fire!
[squawks]

02:32.962 --> 02:34.213
Then where were you?

02:34.297 --> 02:36.132
[sad grunting]

02:38.551 --> 02:41.095
[sighs] No translation needed.

02:41.179 --> 02:42.972
He has no excuse.

02:43.848 --> 02:45.641
I believe you, big guy.

02:45.724 --> 02:47.060
You do too, right, Panchi?

02:47.143 --> 02:50.229
Yes, there's no way
Kong would do something that violent.

02:50.313 --> 02:52.356
[grunting happily]

02:52.440 --> 02:56.735
But, unfortunately, he looks guilty
since he won't tell us where he was.

02:56.820 --> 02:59.613
[reporter] Our exclusive sources
have revealed that police

02:59.697 --> 03:02.200
and private security
are transporting a collection

03:02.283 --> 03:06.537
of the largest and most valuable
diamonds in the world.

03:08.206 --> 03:12.376
Ah, relax, nobody's gonna try anything
with all this firepower.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.420
[grunts]

03:14.503 --> 03:15.880
[roaring]

03:16.589 --> 03:18.299
[reporter exclaims] It's him!

03:18.382 --> 03:21.552
Kong, the ferocious fugitive,
is back and attacking the diamond...

03:21.635 --> 03:22.761
[reporter gasps]

03:23.930 --> 03:24.931
[grunts]

03:28.601 --> 03:29.978
[roaring]

03:35.441 --> 03:37.819
What? I swear, I hit him!

03:37.902 --> 03:39.612
[roars]

03:39.695 --> 03:41.447
[guns firing]

03:43.782 --> 03:44.783
[guns cocking]

03:44.868 --> 03:47.161
We lost him. He's gone!

03:47.245 --> 03:49.330
And so are the diamonds!

03:49.413 --> 03:51.040
<i>Despite all the security,</i>

03:51.124 --> 03:54.418
<i>the gigantic gorilla succeeded in stealing
the entire collection</i>

03:54.502 --> 03:56.838
<i>of the world's largest diamonds.</i>

03:56.921 --> 03:59.298
I don't understand
what's happening with Kong.

03:59.382 --> 04:01.259
Attacking Richard, maybe...

04:01.342 --> 04:04.262
but stealing diamonds?
That makes no sense.

04:04.345 --> 04:08.682
[scoffs] Kong would never steal.
He's a good boy!

04:08.766 --> 04:10.852
Kong! Kong!

04:13.855 --> 04:14.898
[Danny gasps]

04:14.981 --> 04:16.524
Where have you been?

04:16.607 --> 04:18.067
[grunting]

04:21.737 --> 04:24.949
All he'll tell me is that he swears
he didn't leave the forest.

04:25.033 --> 04:27.493
Kong, we really want to believe you.

04:27.576 --> 04:30.704
But we just saw you swan dive
off the Golden Gate Bridge.

04:30.788 --> 04:32.831
[grunting]

04:32.916 --> 04:34.625
Wait...

04:34.708 --> 04:36.085
he's dry!

04:36.169 --> 04:39.505
If he was just in the water,
his fur would still be wet.

04:39.588 --> 04:40.589
Panchi's right!

04:40.673 --> 04:44.468
Plus Kong doesn't know how to swim,
so he'd never dive into the water!

04:44.552 --> 04:46.179
[grunting]

04:47.596 --> 04:50.934
Especially since he knows he can just
swing across the bottom of the bridge.

04:51.017 --> 04:53.727
But we still wish you would
tell us where you were.

04:53.811 --> 04:55.729
[sad grunts]

04:55.813 --> 04:56.940
It's okay,

04:57.023 --> 04:59.400
everyone is entitled to their secrets.

04:59.483 --> 05:02.320
I'm really sorry
I didn't believe you, bro.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.113
Forgive me?
Finger five?

05:06.240 --> 05:07.700
[grunts]

05:09.452 --> 05:13.164
So if it wasn't Kong,
who was the ape on the bridge?

05:13.247 --> 05:16.250
And who attacked Richard
on Kong Island?

05:16.334 --> 05:19.378
[Botila] My bio-sensors
detect increased activity

05:19.462 --> 05:21.672
in the nucleus accumbens
of your brain.

05:21.755 --> 05:25.884
Which informs me that you are
exceedingly pleased with yourself.

05:25.969 --> 05:27.720
Despite the fact that I was the one

05:27.803 --> 05:30.806
that actually procured the diamonds
from the armored truck.

05:30.889 --> 05:36.145
Yes, while everyone was gaping
at the big ape, which I programmed.

05:36.229 --> 05:39.107
How easy it is
to deceive the human eye,

05:39.190 --> 05:41.942
unlike our superior bionic eyes.

05:42.026 --> 05:44.945
It's one of the things
you and I have in common, Botila.

05:45.029 --> 05:48.657
Hmm. One of the very few things.

05:48.741 --> 05:52.578
Well, and an appreciation
for the finer things in life.

05:52.661 --> 05:54.163
Forget it, Botila!

05:54.247 --> 05:57.833
I need all the diamonds
for stage two of my operation.

06:00.128 --> 06:01.212
Fine!

06:01.295 --> 06:03.506
I will just use my superhuman strength

06:03.589 --> 06:07.843
to crush some coal
into my own priceless bling.

06:07.926 --> 06:11.347
So, we are ready to begin
setting up our first outpost?

06:11.430 --> 06:12.556
Not quite.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.849
We need to clear the area,

06:13.932 --> 06:17.186
make sure no one is around
to interfere with my plans.

06:17.270 --> 06:18.771
I'm sure by now,
my brother has figured out

06:18.854 --> 06:21.649
that his precious ape isn't to blame.

06:21.732 --> 06:24.152
So we need to keep Lukas busy.

06:24.235 --> 06:28.114
Naturally, you have already calculated
the best method.

06:28.197 --> 06:30.074
Yes. I call it...

06:30.158 --> 06:33.036
"Follow the bouncing Kong."

06:34.495 --> 06:36.247
[roaring]

06:36.330 --> 06:37.540
[screaming]

06:44.088 --> 06:46.715
- [roaring]
- [all screaming]

06:48.008 --> 06:49.593
[screaming continues]

06:52.096 --> 06:53.347
[roaring]

06:54.098 --> 06:58.018
Man, the way this guy gets around,
it's hard to believe it's just one ape.

06:58.102 --> 06:59.937
One giant ape is amazing,

07:00.020 --> 07:02.356
but two is <i>increíble!</i>

07:02.440 --> 07:05.193
True, but Kong had to come
from somewhere.

07:05.276 --> 07:08.028
For all we know,
he could have a whole family out there.

07:08.112 --> 07:10.489
Hey, Kong,
maybe you have a twin brother!

07:10.573 --> 07:12.241
You know, like Lukas and Richard!

07:13.326 --> 07:16.120
[Panchi] But what if it's an evil twin
like Richard?

07:16.204 --> 07:17.205
[grunts]

07:17.288 --> 07:18.622
[groans] Sorry, bud,

07:18.706 --> 07:21.459
you can pick your nose,
but you can't pick your family.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.960
[grunting]

07:23.044 --> 07:26.130
[laughs] Don't tell him to pick his nose.

07:26.214 --> 07:27.298
I didn't!

07:27.381 --> 07:28.882
[whispers] At least not in public.

07:30.093 --> 07:31.385
[grunts]

07:31.469 --> 07:33.762
Because my brother's savage beast

07:33.846 --> 07:36.765
has become an even greater
menace to society,

07:36.849 --> 07:40.353
I am offering Commissioner Decker
all my vast resources,

07:40.436 --> 07:43.856
including my bionobots,
to help in the hunt for Kong.

07:44.482 --> 07:48.777
And to protect the public
against this grotesque freak of nature.

07:49.653 --> 07:51.364
[chomping]

07:51.447 --> 07:53.866
Ready for more banana <i>buñuelos?</i>

07:53.949 --> 07:56.660
My <i>tia</i> Anita feels so bad
nobody believed Kong,

07:56.744 --> 07:59.247
[chuckles] she just keeps making
more "guilt cookies."

07:59.330 --> 08:01.249
Bawk! Selfish!

08:01.332 --> 08:02.375
Bawk!

08:02.458 --> 08:04.252
[chomping]

08:06.379 --> 08:09.340
[squawking] Yummy <i>buñuelos!</i>

08:10.883 --> 08:12.676
Bawk! Yuck!

08:12.760 --> 08:15.429
[retching] Monkey drool! Bawk!

08:15.513 --> 08:17.265
[both laughing]

08:21.894 --> 08:25.773
I'm guessing my brother knows more
than he's saying about that other ape.

08:25.856 --> 08:27.941
You're probably right,
but how can we find out

08:28.025 --> 08:30.653
before he does even more damage
to Kong's reputation?

08:30.736 --> 08:33.322
I bet Kong could stop
that big troublemaker!

08:33.405 --> 08:35.533
Ah, I think you've got
something there, Danny.

08:35.616 --> 08:38.160
[belching]

08:38.827 --> 08:40.538
Excuse you! Bawk!

08:40.621 --> 08:42.206
Getting two giant apes together?

08:42.289 --> 08:43.957
[chuckles] I don't know.

08:44.041 --> 08:46.001
If people can see how gentle Kong is,

08:46.084 --> 08:47.961
then they would know
that he's not like the other ape,

08:48.045 --> 08:49.422
and then he'll be cleared.

08:50.047 --> 08:53.050
It's not a perfect plan,
but it's the best one we have.

08:53.134 --> 08:54.968
Yeah, there's just one problem.

08:55.052 --> 08:58.347
How do we get Kong to that other ape
before he disappears again?

08:58.431 --> 09:01.684
Harnessing him to the helicopter
made Kong too vulnerable to an attack,

09:01.767 --> 09:03.352
so no way we're doing that again.

09:03.436 --> 09:05.062
I'm way ahead of you.

09:05.146 --> 09:07.648
I've been working
on a Kong-sized version of...

09:07.731 --> 09:09.150
our jetpacks!

09:09.233 --> 09:13.404
Oh, <i>caramba!</i>
I've always wanted to try that!

09:13.487 --> 09:14.780
Now's your chance.

09:14.863 --> 09:16.782
We use them to explore remote areas.

09:16.865 --> 09:19.368
You can build a jetpack
big enough for Kong?

09:19.452 --> 09:21.704
Hey, you're talking to Jonesy!

09:21.787 --> 09:23.414
Of course,
I'll have to make some adjustments

09:23.497 --> 09:26.209
to compensate for the big guy's
weight distribution.

09:26.292 --> 09:28.419
And I'm gonna need
some extra-large parts.

09:28.502 --> 09:31.004
Oh, you really think Kong
will be able to fly?

09:31.088 --> 09:34.550
I'm sure Danny wouldn't mind
giving Kong a little coaching.

09:34.633 --> 09:37.220
Yeah, sure, no prob!

09:37.303 --> 09:38.846
As soon as someone coaches me.

09:38.929 --> 09:40.181
And me!

09:40.264 --> 09:41.390
Deal.

09:49.357 --> 09:52.401
Jonesy, Kong looks totally awesome,

09:52.485 --> 09:55.404
but where did you get the stuff
to build the jetpack?

09:55.488 --> 09:57.740
Let's just say that one
of Richard's aircraft

09:57.823 --> 10:00.075
may be grounded for a while. [laughs]

10:02.578 --> 10:04.872
[exclaims] This is way cool!

10:06.374 --> 10:09.126
[chuckles] Most fun ever!

10:09.210 --> 10:10.544
[squawking]

10:10.628 --> 10:12.380
Not! Bawk!

10:12.463 --> 10:14.215
Sorry, Chatter!

10:16.425 --> 10:18.176
Ready for your first flight, bro?

10:18.261 --> 10:19.428
- [grunts]
- [Lukas] Good to hear,

10:19.512 --> 10:21.597
because that other ape
has just been seen again.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.557
All right!
Time to fly!

10:24.392 --> 10:26.560
Hold on. You guys aren't...

10:26.644 --> 10:28.729
Lukas, you might as well face the facts.

10:28.812 --> 10:30.063
We're a team now.

10:30.147 --> 10:31.982
- Where Kong goes...
- We go!

10:32.065 --> 10:33.317
[grunts]

10:34.485 --> 10:35.486
[sighs]

10:35.569 --> 10:36.737
[chuckles] Okay.

10:42.117 --> 10:46.079
Just remember, stay steady,
and lean in the direction you want to go.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.958
[whirring]

10:51.544 --> 10:52.836
[grunts]

10:53.629 --> 10:55.714
[screaming]

10:55.798 --> 10:57.215
Bawk! Rocket ape!

10:57.300 --> 10:59.343
[exclaiming]

10:59.427 --> 11:01.387
[roaring]

11:05.683 --> 11:07.142
[Danny] No, Kong.

11:07.225 --> 11:08.561
Like this!

11:15.401 --> 11:16.444
[Danny] That's the way, bud!

11:16.527 --> 11:18.821
[Panchi exclaims] You've got it, <i>amigo!</i>

11:18.904 --> 11:20.323
[Kong grunts]

11:23.033 --> 11:24.201
[Kong grunts]

11:38.591 --> 11:40.593
According to the latest report,

11:40.676 --> 11:44.347
the other ape was just sighted
800 miles east of his last location.

11:44.430 --> 11:45.973
Eight hundred miles?

11:46.056 --> 11:48.016
Has he got some magical travel agent?

11:48.100 --> 11:50.268
[chuckles] Yeah,
and I think her name is Botila.

11:50.353 --> 11:52.020
[stutters] But how, why?

11:52.104 --> 11:53.188
I don't know.

11:53.271 --> 11:56.108
Replay earlier news footage of Kong.

11:56.191 --> 11:59.653
[sighs] Everyone knows
the diamonds were stolen,

11:59.737 --> 12:02.322
but no one can figure out
how that giant ape did it.

12:03.198 --> 12:05.033
That's because he didn't!

12:05.117 --> 12:06.118
He was just a distraction,

12:06.201 --> 12:09.955
somehow produced by my brother
to make Kong the scapegoat.

12:10.038 --> 12:12.249
So it's all just about a diamond heist?

12:12.332 --> 12:14.460
No. This is my brother
we're talking about,

12:14.543 --> 12:17.755
so it has to be more
complicated and grandiose.

12:17.838 --> 12:21.884
I think he's somehow created giant apes
to drive people away.

12:21.967 --> 12:23.927
[chuckles] I'm sorry
if I'm sounding like Chatter,

12:24.011 --> 12:25.471
but how, what, why?

12:28.807 --> 12:31.351
- Freeze! That's it!
- The uranium mine!

12:31.435 --> 12:34.187
It's been illegal to mine uranium
since around 2030.

12:34.271 --> 12:37.858
When the powers that be
finally realized the environmental impact,

12:37.941 --> 12:39.735
not just on nature,
but on people.

12:39.818 --> 12:42.655
Well, now, because of the shortage
of weapons-grade uranium,

12:42.738 --> 12:45.866
Richard would make a fortune
selling it on the black market.

12:45.949 --> 12:48.368
Mmm-hmm.
Yo, change of course, kids!

12:48.452 --> 12:50.871
We're heading to New Mexico
to meet the other giant ape,

12:50.954 --> 12:52.581
whoever, or whatever, it is.

13:00.506 --> 13:03.175
[Botila] The stolen diamonds
have unquestionably transformed

13:03.258 --> 13:07.387
T-Rex's teeth into the most
powerful mining tools on Earth.

13:07.471 --> 13:08.972
[roaring]

13:09.848 --> 13:13.226
Alert!
My sensors detect aircraft approaching.

13:13.310 --> 13:14.687
[screeching]

13:18.857 --> 13:20.734
Richard, is that you?

13:20.818 --> 13:22.277
[Richard] No, I'm grounded.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.237
Something is wrong with my helicopter!

13:24.321 --> 13:25.781
[screeching]

13:43.591 --> 13:44.675
[grunting]

13:46.384 --> 13:48.136
[grunts]

13:48.512 --> 13:50.013
[Kong grunts nervously]

13:50.097 --> 13:51.264
[roaring]

13:54.560 --> 13:56.979
It's a Kong-sized hologram!

14:02.485 --> 14:03.944
Kong, stop!

14:04.862 --> 14:06.238
He's not real.

14:07.698 --> 14:08.699
See?

14:08.782 --> 14:10.033
[grunts]

14:11.494 --> 14:12.828
[chuckles]

14:15.831 --> 14:18.375
[Jonesy] Let's see what's behind
the Kong curtain.

14:18.459 --> 14:19.793
I knew it!

14:19.877 --> 14:22.004
Hey, beautiful.
Did you miss me?

14:26.008 --> 14:27.092
[screeches]

14:27.593 --> 14:28.927
[electricity crackling]

14:29.011 --> 14:30.387
We've lost actuator controls!

14:30.471 --> 14:32.014
I'm taking us down!

14:35.934 --> 14:37.185
[T-Rex growling]

14:37.853 --> 14:39.021
[gasps]

14:39.855 --> 14:41.148
[screeching]

14:49.615 --> 14:51.116
[weapons cocking]

14:52.493 --> 14:53.744
[screeching]

14:53.827 --> 14:55.162
[grunts]

14:55.245 --> 14:56.497
[roars]

15:00.208 --> 15:01.585
[rapid gunfire]

15:19.520 --> 15:20.771
[screeching]

15:23.607 --> 15:25.067
[roaring]

15:28.195 --> 15:29.196
[screeches]

15:38.038 --> 15:39.915
Huh, I thought he'd never leave.

15:44.878 --> 15:46.213
[gasps]

15:49.174 --> 15:51.093
[Botila] Military aircraft approaching.

15:51.176 --> 15:53.386
Immediate departure imperative.

15:55.513 --> 15:57.515
I think she's starting to like me.
[chuckles]

15:59.517 --> 16:01.770
Danny, Panchi,
you've got to get out of here!

16:02.479 --> 16:04.940
- Hurry, bro!
- Start heading for home.

16:05.023 --> 16:06.191
No arguing!

16:06.274 --> 16:07.400
- [Kong groans]
- Go now!

16:08.526 --> 16:09.903
[grunts]

16:14.992 --> 16:17.661
[pilot] Uh, squad leader,
we've got an incoming...

16:17.745 --> 16:19.747
giant flying ape?

16:24.209 --> 16:26.837
[pilot 2] Looks like we've caught
uranium thieves red-handed.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.505
[whirring]

16:35.596 --> 16:37.389
[sighs happily] You did it!

16:37.472 --> 16:38.974
Was there ever a doubt?

16:44.396 --> 16:45.773
[rapid gunfire]

16:47.107 --> 16:48.358
[grunts]

16:51.444 --> 16:52.780
[roaring]

17:11.339 --> 17:12.589
[grunts]

17:14.926 --> 17:16.679
Good to see
he's got the hang of that thing.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.265
Yeah, but he's still big as life
for all to see.

17:20.348 --> 17:23.143
If only there was some way
to disguise Kong.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.689
Hey, I made an ape fly,

17:26.771 --> 17:28.941
Camo-Kong couldn't be much harder, right?

17:32.027 --> 17:35.280
[sighs] Could one day could go by
without Kong making big news?

17:35.363 --> 17:37.199
Yeah, where is Kong?

17:39.034 --> 17:41.161
Disappeared in the woods again, huh?

17:41.244 --> 17:42.705
You're up to something.

17:42.788 --> 17:44.039
[grunts]

17:45.040 --> 17:46.959
What's Jonesy doing?

17:47.042 --> 17:49.377
Oh, he's messing
with Richard's latest toy.

17:49.461 --> 17:54.299
Danny picked it up at the mine,
and if I figure out how to fix it,

17:54.382 --> 17:56.468
we can give Richard
a taste of his own medicine.

17:57.219 --> 17:58.345
[chuckles]

17:58.428 --> 18:00.097
Now, that's something I'd like to see.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.181
[grunts]

18:03.058 --> 18:05.268
[man 1] Ah, there's nothing to see.
[man 2] Ape's long gone.

18:05.352 --> 18:08.063
- Look, there he is!
- [distant roaring]

18:11.734 --> 18:13.276
- [roaring]
- Botila!

18:13.360 --> 18:14.695
Shut the hologram off!

18:14.778 --> 18:16.780
No deviating from my plan!

18:16.864 --> 18:19.742
I did not activate
the holographic projector.

18:19.825 --> 18:21.326
[Kong roars]

18:21.409 --> 18:23.036
It's the real Kong!

18:24.037 --> 18:25.663
[grunts]

18:25.748 --> 18:27.290
Call in the dinosaurs!

18:27.374 --> 18:29.542
Keep that beast away from me!

18:35.673 --> 18:37.342
[grunts]

18:38.093 --> 18:40.595
[roaring]

18:42.472 --> 18:44.808
[gasps] That's not Kong!

18:46.059 --> 18:47.811
[roars]

18:49.772 --> 18:50.939
[roars]

18:52.607 --> 18:54.067
It's a hologram!

18:54.151 --> 18:56.028
An astute observation.

18:57.780 --> 18:59.322
Lukas did this.

18:59.406 --> 19:02.117
I don't know
what my brother plans to gain!

19:02.200 --> 19:04.036
[woman gasps] Where'd he go?
[man] What's happening?

19:04.119 --> 19:06.538
- [all gasping]
- [Kong grunts]

19:06.621 --> 19:07.873
[all gasping]

19:09.332 --> 19:10.751
[excited grunting]

19:11.877 --> 19:14.171
[crowd cheering]

19:15.088 --> 19:17.049
[all laughing]

19:19.384 --> 19:21.344
[man 1] Hey, they're fake!

19:21.428 --> 19:22.720
[man 2 chuckling] Holograms!

19:26.975 --> 19:28.685
[crowd cheering]

19:35.442 --> 19:36.443
[all laughing]

19:38.904 --> 19:41.364
[chuckling]
<i>Hello, Richard.</i>

19:41.448 --> 19:44.409
<i>Now, let's see how
you like being the one left to explain.</i>

19:47.913 --> 19:52.042
Dr. Remy, what do you make
of all the simulated Kong sightings?

19:52.709 --> 19:56.629
Sadly, I fear my brother was using them
to create distractions

19:56.713 --> 20:00.342
while he and his real Kong
stole the weapons-grade uranium.

20:03.511 --> 20:05.388
Man, that guy's got major <i>chutzpah.</i>

20:05.472 --> 20:08.266
Bawk! <i>Mucho chutzpah.</i>

20:08.350 --> 20:10.060
[sighs] Richard steals the uranium

20:10.143 --> 20:12.437
and sticks Kong and Lukas
with the blame, as usual.

20:13.396 --> 20:15.107
Hey, where are they?

20:18.776 --> 20:21.113
[Danny] So this is why
you've been sneaking off!

20:21.196 --> 20:22.405
[grunts]

20:23.240 --> 20:24.782
Building a tree fort!

20:24.867 --> 20:26.451
Cool!

20:26.534 --> 20:28.161
Why didn't you tell us?

20:28.245 --> 20:29.662
[grunting]

20:29.746 --> 20:31.664
You wanted it to be a surprise.

20:42.217 --> 20:44.094
[laughs] Wow, Kong built you a fort

20:44.177 --> 20:46.930
just like the one we made
when we were kids.

20:47.014 --> 20:48.723
[grunting]

20:49.641 --> 20:53.311
Now, you two have your own special place
just like we did.

20:53.395 --> 20:55.230
[Danny] Whoa!

20:55.313 --> 20:57.024
You built this for us...

20:57.107 --> 20:58.650
without any help?

20:58.733 --> 20:59.902
[grunts]

21:01.862 --> 21:03.030
[grunting] Uh-oh!

21:03.113 --> 21:04.531
[rumbling]

21:04.614 --> 21:06.116
- [crashing]
- [Kong grunts]

21:08.535 --> 21:09.702
[sad grunt]

21:09.786 --> 21:12.080
Hey, what is it they say?

21:12.164 --> 21:13.748
It's the thought that counts.

21:13.831 --> 21:15.000
[chuckles]

21:16.709 --> 21:17.710
[grunts]

21:19.171 --> 21:21.173
