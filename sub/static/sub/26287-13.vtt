LETHAL WEAPON #313
"Coyote Ugly"
Closed Captioned

00:08.634 --> 00:10.427
(insects trilling)

00:12.638 --> 00:14.556
(man speaking Spanish)

00:26.610 --> 00:28.278
Vamos, vamos.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.044
Gracias.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.838
Los Angeles, para allá.

00:46.838 --> 00:48.799
Barstow...

00:48.799 --> 00:49.841
(speaking Spanish)

00:49.841 --> 00:50.759
No te preocupes.

00:55.889 --> 00:56.932
(man speaking Spanish)

00:58.058 --> 00:59.142
Hey!

01:11.530 --> 01:12.698
(laughs)
Okay.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.783
Gracias.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.580
Someone's following us.

01:20.580 --> 01:21.665
Hold on.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.424
Turn off your lights
and pull over.

01:41.560 --> 01:42.686
No.

01:59.369 --> 02:02.414
MAYA: Why don't you tell me
where you came from?

02:02.414 --> 02:04.541
Well, I think our people
are from Scotland.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.001
And Hungary.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.919
And there's probably
some Norse in there somewhere.

02:07.919 --> 02:11.256
Okay, but where'd
you grow up?

02:11.256 --> 02:13.842
All over.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.010
You might need a...

02:15.010 --> 02:18.597
few more branches
for your poster board.

02:18.597 --> 02:20.766
What about your mom?

02:20.766 --> 02:22.642
You never really talk
about her much.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.020
You sure you don't
want to spend

02:25.020 --> 02:26.813
our day together
outdoors?

02:26.813 --> 02:28.398
Your mom could probably
fill in that stuff.

02:28.398 --> 02:29.274
Is it really that bad?

02:30.400 --> 02:32.611
No, I just...

02:32.611 --> 02:34.237
had a different upbringing
than most kids.

02:36.782 --> 02:39.117
(man speaking Spanish on radio)

02:46.958 --> 02:49.127
When you're quiet,
you're thinking.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.048
Good or bad?

02:53.048 --> 02:56.134
I think I bombed
my geometry test today.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.678
I'm bummed about it.

02:58.678 --> 03:01.223
Well, there's more to
life than geometry.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.183
What about on the way to school

03:03.183 --> 03:05.185
or afterwards?

03:05.185 --> 03:06.937
Anything
interesting happen?

03:06.937 --> 03:10.190
I heard the bus driver
complaining about his ex-wife.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.109
There you go.

03:13.527 --> 03:17.114
You learn any dirty words
in Spanish?

03:17.114 --> 03:18.532
No.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.284
Yes, you did.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.911
(chuckles)

03:25.956 --> 03:27.666
Did you do this?

03:27.666 --> 03:30.752
Yeah, you had two pictures
left on your last roll.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.087
I finished it.

03:32.087 --> 03:35.841
That's nice composition.
It's good focus.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.926
I like the subject matter's
emotion there.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.387
That's hard to capture.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.181
All right, kiddo.

03:43.181 --> 03:45.684
Maybe there's some promise
in you after all.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.445
TRISH:
Okay, so before I officially

03:56.445 --> 03:58.780
announce that
I am running for D.A.,

03:58.780 --> 04:02.367
my campaign manager wants
to look into the family.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.327
Look how?

04:04.327 --> 04:06.788
You mean ask questions?
They're vetting us
without our consent.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.040
Yes, it's
a vetting process,

04:09.040 --> 04:10.459
but it's like
a background check.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.544
Totally normal.
They're gonna look into me?

04:12.544 --> 04:13.879
No, honey.

04:13.879 --> 04:14.880
I'm a cop.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.798
I do the looking into others.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.592
Roger.

04:18.592 --> 04:19.885
Are you worried

04:19.885 --> 04:21.178
something might turn up?

04:21.178 --> 04:22.888
(laughing):
No.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.558
Not at all, it-it's just
that I just...

04:26.558 --> 04:27.976
Dad, you look a
little worried.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.395
(doorbell rings)
Okay, everybody.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.731
Relax,
here she is.

04:32.731 --> 04:35.358
Hey, Dad, you might want
to check your browser history.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.319
What's, what's the browser...
TRISH: Okay.

04:37.319 --> 04:38.945
Everyone, this is Cynthia.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.572
Hello, it is so good
to meet you.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.324
Hi, I'm innocent.
Yeah, I didn't
do anything.

04:42.324 --> 04:43.992
MURTAUGH:
Just so you know,

04:43.992 --> 04:46.286
the LAPD does background checks.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.538
(laughing): So there's
no sense in looking into me.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.831
Oh, we have
our own process.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.628
But, oh, there's nothing
to worry about.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.171
No, this is,
this is really about

04:56.171 --> 04:57.672
getting out ahead
of any vulnerabilities

04:57.672 --> 04:59.674
that the opposition
might uncover.

04:59.674 --> 05:00.884
Vulnerabilities.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.511
Like a college dropout

05:02.511 --> 05:04.095
starting a pot
dispensary?

05:05.263 --> 05:06.848
You mean a young entrepreneur

05:06.848 --> 05:10.393
opening a business that is
symbolic of a progressive city?

05:10.393 --> 05:12.854
Hmm, entrepreneur.
See, I like that.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.023
I've had to spin
so much worse.

05:15.023 --> 05:18.777
(laughs) Okay, so we are all
on the same team.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.862
Okay?
CYNTHIA: So if you have
any questions,

05:20.862 --> 05:22.155
just let me know.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.075
And later we'll talk
about the investigation.

05:25.075 --> 05:28.203
The investigation. Am I gonna
need a lawyer for this?

05:28.203 --> 05:29.996
(laughs) So charming.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.748
I know, he is.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.210
NATALIE:
Thanks for coming.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.128
I didn't know
who else to trust.

05:37.128 --> 05:39.339
He came in with
a gunshot wound.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.091
I think he crossed
illegally.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.342
Cole, you cannot tell

05:42.342 --> 05:44.386
anyone I am doing this, please.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.513
I'll keep it between us.
What's going on?

05:46.513 --> 05:48.223
His daughter's still out there.

05:48.223 --> 05:50.350
Out where?
In the desert.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.685
I'm not sure where.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.145
What's his name?
Can I talk to him?

05:54.145 --> 05:57.732
Jose Mendoza-- he's stable
but not entirely lucid.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.863
My Spanish is rough,
but is English okay?

06:05.031 --> 06:06.533
Yes.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.953
Jose, why did you leave
your daughter in the desert?

06:09.953 --> 06:12.414
We were being chased
by the men who shot me

06:12.414 --> 06:14.416
and that poor young lady.

06:14.416 --> 06:15.959
Who shot you?

06:17.043 --> 06:18.420
Cartel.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.255
Government.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.799
Coyotes, maybe.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.467
Please.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.053
Find my daughter.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.638
Please.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.350
(siren wailing in distance)

06:34.811 --> 06:36.813
(camera shutter clicks)

06:36.813 --> 06:38.898
Scorsese.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.734
Victim's Sandra Hawkins,

06:40.734 --> 06:41.818
journalism student
at Pepperdine.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.280
Well, what brought her out here?

06:45.280 --> 06:47.741
She died
prior to impact.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.909
Multiple bullet holes
outside the vehicle.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.703
I'm running the blood from
inside the car for any matches.

06:54.289 --> 06:56.082
Anyone see the passenger?
GUTE:
No witnesses,

06:56.082 --> 06:57.834
but we're looking
at cameras in the area.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.502
What about Cole?

06:59.502 --> 07:01.212
Anybody see Cole?

07:03.340 --> 07:04.591
(sighs)

07:04.591 --> 07:05.759
(dialing)

07:05.759 --> 07:07.510
(line ringing)

07:07.510 --> 07:08.928
COLE (coughs):
Roger.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.222
Were you planning on coming
to work today, sir?

07:11.222 --> 07:12.766
Oh, yeah, sorry, buddy.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.225
I meant to give you a call.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.645
Yeah, I'm feeling a little,
uh, under the weather today.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.271
Under the weather?

07:18.271 --> 07:19.481
And what's the forecast?

07:19.481 --> 07:21.274
Food poisoning maybe.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.277
Okay, listen, Cole, being a cop
is way too important of a job

07:24.277 --> 07:25.904
for you to play hooky.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.614
Roger, I'm really gonna need
to take that sick day.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.616
But I promise I'm gonna
get you a doctor's note.

07:29.616 --> 07:30.867
Hey, I don't-- I...
(line cuts)

07:38.249 --> 07:40.543
MURTAUGH: So, Trish
is doing background checks

07:40.543 --> 07:42.295
on all of us
before the campaign.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.214
Now, you've been
through this whole

07:44.214 --> 07:45.799
vetting process thing.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.717
How deep a dive
are we talking?

07:47.717 --> 07:49.219
Enough to put
a man under. Why?

07:49.219 --> 07:51.971
Okay, well, if the
phone call comes in

07:51.971 --> 07:54.599
and they start asking
you certain questions,

07:54.599 --> 07:56.142
I just need to know
that you got my back.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.520
Roger, what exactly
do I need to have your back on?

07:58.520 --> 08:01.064
Don't make me say it.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.983
Come on, we both know it was
a different time back then.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.361
Uh...

08:06.361 --> 08:08.905
The Venice Canals. The crate.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.448
The open crate.

08:10.448 --> 08:11.825
We both took some.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.702
Cheese.
(shushes)

08:13.702 --> 08:16.121
Illegal cheese.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.580
I just want to
make sure that

08:17.580 --> 08:19.624
Trish's whole career
is not ruined

08:19.624 --> 08:21.084
because of my love
for Beaufort d'été.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.461
It was gonna melt.

08:23.461 --> 08:26.840
It was a reasonable decision
in the line of duty.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.508
Thank you.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.885
Uh, you don't happen to have
any of that left, do you?

08:30.885 --> 08:33.346
That stuff was amazing.
No, I had to get rid of it.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.848
Yeah.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.349
We both did.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.809
Yeah.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.563
BAILEY:
Agent Wells, we understand

08:41.563 --> 08:42.564
that your team detained

08:42.564 --> 08:44.023
several undocumented
immigrants

08:44.023 --> 08:45.233
at the border
last night.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.360
We did a roundup not far
from Las Cantilles.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.696
A drop-off point
for some of our coyotes.

08:49.696 --> 08:50.697
See anything stand out?

08:50.697 --> 08:52.282
There were two people missing.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.868
A father and daughter, according
to some of our detainees.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.703
There was a car
waiting for them.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.997
The same make and model
of our victim, Sandra Hawkins.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.041
WELLS:
Let me guess.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.377
Young, blonde,
someone no one would suspect.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.254
Much less likely to be searched.

09:06.254 --> 09:09.466
So is there any reason why
our victim would cut out

09:09.466 --> 09:11.885
the coyote and take over a
father and daughter on her own?

09:11.885 --> 09:14.304
They were smuggling something.

09:14.304 --> 09:15.513
Most likely drugs.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.640
Whatever they were trying
to bring across...

09:18.767 --> 09:20.143
...it was worth killing for.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.508
Ana?

09:56.262 --> 09:57.764
No, no.
It's okay.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.266
No, no, no, come on.
It's okay.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.310
(crying):
No. Please don't hurt me.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.687
Everything's fine.
(panting)

10:04.687 --> 10:06.272
I'm gonna get you out of here.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.361
Bet you could use a drink.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.328
It's kind of crazy how water
can actually taste good

10:20.328 --> 10:21.704
when you're thirsty, huh?

10:24.749 --> 10:25.959
Where's my father?

10:25.959 --> 10:27.627
He was shot.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.878
He's in the hospital.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.630
But he's fine. Okay?

10:30.630 --> 10:34.551
He's got the best doctor
in the world looking after him.

10:34.551 --> 10:35.844
What do you say
I get you out of here,

10:35.844 --> 10:37.095
you go see him?

10:40.181 --> 10:41.975
Come here.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.519
It's okay.

10:44.519 --> 10:45.728
(engine roars)

10:47.355 --> 10:49.190
It's them!

10:49.190 --> 10:51.192
Who's "them," Ana?

10:51.192 --> 10:53.820
Come on, get down.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.447
(Ana whimpering)

11:09.043 --> 11:11.170
We got to run.
Let's go.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.181
Ana, we're gonna have to jump.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.899
(both grunting)

11:37.322 --> 11:38.531
(groans)

11:40.825 --> 11:42.035
There. Go, go, go.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.708
(both panting)

11:48.708 --> 11:49.876
(man speaking Spanish)

11:56.591 --> 11:59.218
We're safe for now.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.436
(groans)

12:08.436 --> 12:10.021
Good thing I called in sick.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.235
(Cole grunting)

12:18.905 --> 12:22.075
Ah, let's stop
here for a sec.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.409
(groans)

12:32.293 --> 12:33.795
Does it hurt?

12:33.795 --> 12:37.215
No. I've had worse.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.179
Any idea who those guys
were back there?

12:43.179 --> 12:45.598
No.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.558
Coyotes, maybe.

12:48.518 --> 12:49.811
Thank you.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.157
No signal.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.994
Does anyone else know
we are here?

13:05.994 --> 13:07.495
My ex.

13:07.495 --> 13:10.373
But I told her
not to tell anybody.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.959
Seemed like a good idea
at the time.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.297
What are we going to do?

13:20.425 --> 13:22.760
We're gonna head west.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.180
The road is about
30 miles that way.

13:27.265 --> 13:30.476
Get help there.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.905
CYNTHIA:
So, I'm just, uh,

13:42.905 --> 13:44.907
wrapping up
our initial investigation.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.243
Oh. Any red flags?

13:47.243 --> 13:49.620
My kids looked
a little nervous the other day.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.497
No, actually,
I just have to follow up,

13:51.497 --> 13:52.999
uh, something on your end.

13:52.999 --> 13:56.919
Do you have contact information
for Barry Turtletaub?

13:56.919 --> 13:59.672
(chuckles)
Where'd you get that name?

13:59.672 --> 14:01.966
I just pulled up
the marriage certificate.

14:04.302 --> 14:06.596
This was not a marriage.

14:06.596 --> 14:09.307
Okay, Trish,
this is just a copy,

14:09.307 --> 14:11.601
because this is
in the public record.

14:11.601 --> 14:14.353
Is this gonna
be a problem?

14:14.353 --> 14:15.772
(exhales)

14:15.772 --> 14:19.859
I... I was just a kid.

14:19.859 --> 14:23.279
He was in a band, I went
on tour with him after college,

14:23.279 --> 14:26.115
we ended up in Vegas.
It was just two weeks.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.701
It didn't even feel real.
I guess I was blocking it out.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.328
Roger doesn't know, does he?

14:36.709 --> 14:38.127
I wanted to tell him.

14:41.130 --> 14:46.385
I wanted our marriage
to feel like the first time.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.304
To be perfect.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.934
(sighs)

14:52.934 --> 14:54.602
I am a terrible person,
aren't I?

14:54.602 --> 14:57.230
No. No, you are real.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.564
You're honest.

14:58.564 --> 15:02.235
That's why you're gonna
be such a good D.A.

15:02.235 --> 15:05.029
And you know what? The truth
is, the campaign's gonna focus

15:05.029 --> 15:06.572
on your legal expertise.
There's a chance

15:06.572 --> 15:09.742
this won't
even come up.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.410
MURTAUGH:
Natalie.

15:13.204 --> 15:14.455
Roger.

15:14.455 --> 15:15.915
What are you doing here?

15:15.915 --> 15:17.250
I'm looking for Cole.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.876
Last time we talked,
he said he was sick.

15:18.876 --> 15:22.088
I brought him some of my
homemade matzah ball soup

15:22.088 --> 15:24.090
to his motel, but
he wasn't there.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.466
Do you know where he is?

15:25.466 --> 15:28.636
Uh, maybe he's at the store?

15:28.636 --> 15:30.763
Loading up on some sports
drinks? Got to hydrate

15:30.763 --> 15:32.265
when you're that sick, you know.
Yeah.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.393
Uh, you want to tell me
what's really going on?

15:35.393 --> 15:37.353
(sighs)

16:11.137 --> 16:12.471
Hello?

16:13.598 --> 16:15.600
Anybody here?

16:17.059 --> 16:19.228
Maybe they don't
summer here too much.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.565
Check the phone.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.322
Phone's dead.

16:49.926 --> 16:50.843
(chuckles)

16:53.012 --> 16:55.556
GILLIAN:
My God, Wes.

16:55.556 --> 16:59.060
I think you're making a mistake.

16:59.060 --> 17:01.896
Mom, I've already made
my decision. I'm going.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.940
Yeah, but it's not too late
to reconsider, Wes.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.942
You know, shouldn't
you be proud of me?

17:05.942 --> 17:07.360
I got into a good school,
I'm going to college.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.738
I want to be proud
of you, but...

17:10.738 --> 17:13.491
this is the last place
I thought you would go.

17:13.491 --> 17:14.951
What's wrong with West Point?

17:14.951 --> 17:18.079
No, there's...
there's nothing's wrong with it.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.872
It's just...

17:19.872 --> 17:22.124
If this is your way
of rebelling,

17:22.124 --> 17:23.668
please do something else.
Take a year off,

17:23.668 --> 17:26.462
join a cult. Anything but this.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.673
You just want me to be like you.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.633
That's, that's not true.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.218
I want you to think
for yourself.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.845
I just don't want the military
doing your thinking for you.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.806
Mom, I'm not like you.
I don't want your life.

17:36.806 --> 17:39.350
This is what I want to do.
Wes, it's dangerous.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.602
So is what you do! Jumping
from war zone to war zone

17:41.602 --> 17:43.062
just to take friggin' pictures?

17:49.986 --> 17:53.906
Is that all you think I do?
Just take pictures?

17:56.117 --> 17:57.785
My work means something.

17:57.785 --> 18:00.663
Every one
of those pictures matter.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.790
I'm trying to make a difference.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.586
So am I.

18:06.586 --> 18:07.920
I'm going, Mom.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.422
Wes.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.138
Wes.

18:17.138 --> 18:21.475
Cole, stay with me. It's okay.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.394
Cole.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.147
Come on.

18:31.152 --> 18:33.988
MURTAUGH:
Drive faster, Bailey.
Both hands on the wheel.

18:33.988 --> 18:35.615
BAILEY:
Murtaugh, I don't take
orders from you.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.783
Okay?

18:37.783 --> 18:39.744
Did I do something?

18:39.744 --> 18:41.078
Murtaugh, am I your equal?

18:41.078 --> 18:43.164
Because I'm starting
to feel like I'm not.

18:43.164 --> 18:44.332
And I do think
that you've been

18:44.332 --> 18:46.334
treating me like an assistant,
not a detective.

18:46.334 --> 18:47.793
And not your equal.

18:47.793 --> 18:50.796
So I think
what you're saying is,

18:50.796 --> 18:53.799
you don't like
our shtick anymore?

18:54.925 --> 18:56.886
Cole's car.

19:04.935 --> 19:06.687
Is that Cole?

19:12.610 --> 19:14.028
That's not Cole.
Back up.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.039
Who the hell are they?

19:26.207 --> 19:28.292
Reverse! Reverse!
What?

19:28.292 --> 19:29.710
MURTAUGH:
Go!

19:31.128 --> 19:32.254
Turn, Bailey, turn!

19:37.009 --> 19:38.594
What are we doing?

19:38.594 --> 19:42.098
Trust me, this is the
right thing to do.

19:42.098 --> 19:43.933
Wait a minute. Where's
the rest of the road?

19:43.933 --> 19:45.768
There is no rest
of the road!

19:48.062 --> 19:49.939
(both grunting)

19:56.487 --> 19:57.238
(gunfire)

20:01.117 --> 20:02.451
We need to call for backup.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.329
There's no signal.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.872
All right.
What's the game plan?

20:06.872 --> 20:08.666
MURTAUGH:
Looks like Cole's in trouble.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.004
Let's go.

20:14.004 --> 20:16.215
Yeah.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.097
COLE (weak):
Did you find anything?

20:23.097 --> 20:26.851
I found this,
but no alcohol.

20:26.851 --> 20:28.936
That's good enough.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.825
Ana, I'm gonna need you
to do this.

20:42.825 --> 20:46.537
Uh, I... I can't.

20:46.537 --> 20:49.081
Can you thread the needle?

20:50.750 --> 20:52.418
Then you can.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.420
Because if we don't
get this stitched up...

21:04.680 --> 21:07.683
Just... sterilize the needle.

21:12.771 --> 21:16.108
That's good.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.405
(moans softly)

21:21.405 --> 21:22.740
It's okay.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.867
Just start from the end.

21:24.867 --> 21:27.036
Like you're lacing your shoes.

21:32.249 --> 21:33.125
(winces)

21:46.305 --> 21:49.600
Cole? Cole, stay with me.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.268
Talk to me.

21:51.268 --> 21:52.228
Hey.

21:52.228 --> 21:54.522
Okay.

21:54.522 --> 21:56.524
You-you said

21:56.524 --> 21:59.777
"mother" in your sleep.

21:59.777 --> 22:02.154
Did she pass away?

22:03.447 --> 22:05.366
Yeah.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.577
Long time ago.

22:32.101 --> 22:33.519
How did it happen?

22:35.646 --> 22:37.648
A rocket attack.

22:37.648 --> 22:41.569
At Citluk, not far
from the fighting.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.948
Sounds like someplace she'd be.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.744
She left this behind.

22:59.295 --> 23:00.879
Maybe you have it now.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.536
Something's wrong, Cap.
Bailey's ignoring all my calls.

23:32.536 --> 23:34.038
She and Murtaugh have
been missing since

23:34.038 --> 23:35.289
they went looking for Cole.

23:35.289 --> 23:37.541
Looking for-- Where's Cole?
I'm always in the dark.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.543
Why is it so hard
to tell me what's going on?

23:39.543 --> 23:40.878
Okay, I'm telling you now,

23:40.878 --> 23:43.339
so when you're done,
maybe we go find them.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.257
Yeah, let's go find 'em.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.092
Well, let's go.
Okay.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.678
MURTAUGH:
I-I think what we've established

23:49.678 --> 23:52.556
is a mentor-mentee
relationship.

23:52.556 --> 23:53.807
Yeah, maybe when I was a rookie,

23:53.807 --> 23:55.351
which was a long time ago,
Murtaugh.

23:55.351 --> 23:58.604
Yes, but the sharing of my
knowledge goes on and on.

23:58.604 --> 24:00.522
But respect
is happening now.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.900
From top to bottom.
Equals.
Oh, right,

24:02.900 --> 24:07.446
from the top. Yeah. This
is, uh, Avery's fault.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.614
You know what? No.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.866
I'm not gonna let you
pass the buck on this one.

24:10.866 --> 24:13.160
Why do you feel like you can
always talk down to me?

24:13.160 --> 24:14.703
Why don't you treat me
like your equal?

24:15.829 --> 24:17.331
(sighs)

24:17.331 --> 24:19.875
You're like
family to me.

24:19.875 --> 24:23.462
Yeah, maybe it seems like
I'm talking down to you,

24:23.462 --> 24:26.215
but that's how I talk to
the people I care about.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.592
And, yeah,
they complain.

24:28.592 --> 24:31.387
But welcome to the family.

24:34.264 --> 24:35.557
Someone's chasing us.

24:39.103 --> 24:41.438
Go!

24:46.527 --> 24:48.445
(groaning)

24:53.492 --> 24:56.453
Ana...

24:56.453 --> 24:58.539
I think I'm seeing things again.

24:58.539 --> 25:00.249
What do you see?

25:00.249 --> 25:02.501
(groans) Out the window.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.128
My partner.

25:07.464 --> 25:11.176
Is he a tall, handsome,
African-American man?

25:11.176 --> 25:14.096
Handsome?
That's definitely not him.

25:15.472 --> 25:18.142
Roger, it is you.
Cole!

25:18.142 --> 25:19.643
I thought you were a mirage.

25:19.643 --> 25:22.187
Why the hell did
you lie to me, huh?

25:22.187 --> 25:24.565
You-- we're partners. You--
we should be past that...

25:24.565 --> 25:27.651
You're shot.
Just hop in your car

25:27.651 --> 25:29.528
and drive to the hospital,
I'll be right as rain.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.779
Yeah, about that...

25:32.698 --> 25:35.117
All right, here they come.

25:35.117 --> 25:37.119
This isn't a rescue? (groans)
No.

25:37.119 --> 25:38.829
It's more of an Alamo
kind of deal.

25:40.748 --> 25:41.749
COLE:
Ana, get down.

25:42.624 --> 25:44.376
(gunfire)

25:45.753 --> 25:46.503
(groans)

25:51.675 --> 25:52.718
Bailey,

25:52.718 --> 25:54.094
how many more
rounds you got?

25:54.094 --> 25:55.637
Not enough.

25:55.637 --> 25:57.973
Me neither.
So I guess we're equals.

26:01.935 --> 26:03.645
What the hell do they want?

26:06.023 --> 26:08.025
(gunfire stops)
(man speaking Spanish)

26:09.985 --> 26:12.613
(helicopter flying overhead)

26:12.613 --> 26:13.989
Am I hearing things?

26:15.157 --> 26:16.492
A helicopter?

26:21.205 --> 26:22.956
It's a helicopter, all right.

26:22.956 --> 26:24.833
MAN (over P.A.):
This is the LAPD.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.752
Stop your vehicle.

26:26.752 --> 26:29.421
Think it scared
off the shooters.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.673
MURTAUGH:
All right, Cole,
let's get you to the hospital.

26:48.398 --> 26:51.360
Wouldn't it be easier
just to tell me what's going on?

26:51.360 --> 26:54.530
I'm the last one to know,
and I literally have

26:54.530 --> 26:56.406
to swoop in here
and save your ass.

26:56.406 --> 26:59.493
Can you understand
a word he's saying?!

26:59.493 --> 27:00.619
No.

27:04.373 --> 27:05.582
Vitals?
Stable.

27:05.582 --> 27:08.043
No signs of infection.
Cole, can you hear me?

27:08.043 --> 27:10.754
Prep him for surgery. OR Seven.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.548
Hey, Nat.

27:12.548 --> 27:14.007
Hmm?

27:14.007 --> 27:15.926
We got to stop meeting
like this.

27:15.926 --> 27:17.719
Cole, I am so sorry.

27:17.719 --> 27:20.055
I'm not.

27:20.055 --> 27:22.140
This time I got the girl.

27:27.104 --> 27:28.230
Is he gonna be all right?

27:28.230 --> 27:30.524
We're gonna prep him
for surgery. He should be fine.

27:30.524 --> 27:33.110
You do the stitching?
Probably saved his life.

27:33.110 --> 27:34.403
Can I see my father?

27:34.403 --> 27:36.655
I wouldn't recommend it.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.365
They have police stationed
outside of his room.

27:38.365 --> 27:41.285
They might take you
into custody, Ana.

27:43.078 --> 27:46.415
Hey, listen, I have a
daughter about your age.

27:46.415 --> 27:49.251
You can come with me until we
get this all straightened out.

27:49.251 --> 27:51.712
Get yourself a nice,
hot meal, cleaned up.

27:51.712 --> 27:53.505
No questions asked.

27:56.216 --> 28:01.179
Vámonos. Did I
say that right?

28:01.179 --> 28:03.682
CYNTHIA:
Okay, I-I only have
a couple of questions.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.310
Okay.
Should we wait for Roger?

28:06.310 --> 28:10.188
You know, um, no. Why don't we
just get started without him?

28:10.188 --> 28:12.441
Okay. We'll start
with RJ and Riana.

28:12.441 --> 28:13.692
What'd they do?

28:13.692 --> 28:16.528
Nothing, nothing,
they're great kids.

28:16.528 --> 28:19.573
We're just gonna focus on some
areas of concern that we have

28:19.573 --> 28:22.284
to be prepared for under
the microscope of a campaign.

28:22.284 --> 28:24.703
Let's take
for example, uh,

28:24.703 --> 28:25.871
Riana's second
Instagram account.

28:25.871 --> 28:28.040
You have a second account?

28:28.040 --> 28:29.666
Why do you need
two accounts?

28:29.666 --> 28:31.084
Okay, Mom, calm down.

28:31.084 --> 28:33.587
Someone hacked my first one,
so I opened up another one.

28:33.587 --> 28:35.547
CYNTHIA:
Okay, that's
totally reasonable.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.174
I will caution you,

28:37.174 --> 28:42.012
however, against posting selfies
of underage drinking.

28:42.012 --> 28:45.182
You were drinking?
Okay, we can't all be
saints, right?

28:45.182 --> 28:47.309
What does that mean?

28:49.436 --> 28:51.396
CYNTHIA:
Okay, uh, let's go to RJ next.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.023
What'd he do?

28:53.023 --> 28:55.067
Well, uh, do you think
you can explain

28:55.067 --> 28:56.818
this public exposure charge?

28:56.818 --> 28:58.820
What?
Wow.

28:58.820 --> 29:01.323
Look, um, listen, Mom,
I-I-I had to use the bathroom.

29:01.323 --> 29:02.532
And you couldn't find
a restroom?

29:02.532 --> 29:04.284
No, the-the place
that I was at

29:04.284 --> 29:06.620
was closed, so I...
What place was that?

29:06.620 --> 29:09.831
(sighs)
Los Coyotes.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.708
And you couldn't find
a bathroom, really?

29:11.708 --> 29:13.460
Listen, why are we focused
on me right now?

29:13.460 --> 29:15.587
Shouldn't we be focusing
on the elephant in the room?

29:18.215 --> 29:19.800
What elephant?

29:21.134 --> 29:22.761
Your first husband.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.388
Barry Turtletaub?

29:24.388 --> 29:26.473
What's happening, everyone?

29:30.268 --> 29:32.646
What's going on?
Roger...

29:32.646 --> 29:35.273
can I talk to you
in the other room?

29:38.026 --> 29:39.903
Roger, what's going on?
Who is this?

29:39.903 --> 29:42.030
This is Ana.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.700
She's a Mexican refugee,
snuck across the border.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.994
I found her
in the desert,

29:46.994 --> 29:49.121
and now I'm hiding her
from the authorities.

29:49.121 --> 29:52.833
Now, you mind telling me
what you're hiding?

30:07.222 --> 30:09.182
NATALIE: You had it
on you when you came in.

30:11.184 --> 30:14.104
It's one of your
mom's photos, right?

30:14.104 --> 30:16.064
Yeah.

30:19.401 --> 30:21.778
For a second out there
in the desert,

30:21.778 --> 30:24.614
I thought she was with me.

30:24.614 --> 30:27.409
Was watching over me
or something.

30:29.453 --> 30:32.873
Maya's been asking.
I didn't know what to tell her.

30:39.296 --> 30:42.257
I think I don't really talk
about her because...

30:42.257 --> 30:46.136
when I look back
on my life,

30:46.136 --> 30:49.139
all the decisions that I made...

30:53.977 --> 30:56.938
I don't know what
she would think of me.

31:03.028 --> 31:05.363
I think she would be
proud of you.

31:08.617 --> 31:10.869
Sometimes I'm not so sure.

31:15.832 --> 31:17.501
(dog barking)

31:17.501 --> 31:19.086
RIANA:
Here.

31:19.086 --> 31:20.629
These should fit.

31:20.629 --> 31:23.298
Thanks.
Do you need
anything else?

31:23.298 --> 31:24.633
Is there any way...

31:24.633 --> 31:26.384
Oh, do you need to use my phone?

31:26.384 --> 31:28.345
To call my father
in the hospital.

31:28.345 --> 31:29.471
I promise I won't take long.

31:29.471 --> 31:30.931
Yeah, of course. Take your time.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.437
(knocking on door)
NURSE: Jose?

31:37.437 --> 31:39.564
Don't tell anyone that
I let you take a call,

31:39.564 --> 31:40.690
but it's your daughter.

31:42.359 --> 31:43.860
(straining)

31:43.860 --> 31:46.530
Thank you very much.

31:46.530 --> 31:47.697
Ana?

31:47.697 --> 31:49.574
(sighs)
Papá.

32:09.636 --> 32:10.554
Okay.

32:25.652 --> 32:27.571
Okay.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.581
Mr. Mendoza.

32:37.581 --> 32:40.500
We're with the U.S. Customs
and Border Protection.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.753
Now that you're stable, we'll be
taking you into custody.

32:47.632 --> 32:49.593
MURTAUGH:
Barry Turtletaub?

32:49.593 --> 32:51.469
Roger, honey, listen.

32:51.469 --> 32:53.346
I feel like I don't
even know you anymore,

32:53.346 --> 32:55.348
like there's a stranger
in my house.

32:55.348 --> 32:58.560
A stranger? Roger,
you just brought someone

32:58.560 --> 33:00.770
we don't know into our home.

33:00.770 --> 33:03.273
Don't make this about Ana!
Well, I want to know who she is.

33:03.273 --> 33:06.776
She's a helpless young girl
in need of asylum,

33:06.776 --> 33:08.361
and she has nowhere else to go.

33:08.361 --> 33:09.613
(engine starts)

33:19.164 --> 33:22.083
You sure about that?

33:24.002 --> 33:25.795
Yo, Bailey,
Border Patrol called.

33:25.795 --> 33:27.422
Said they were gonna
transfer Jose Mendoza

33:27.422 --> 33:28.715
to their custody tonight.

33:28.715 --> 33:30.425
That wasn't supposed
to happen till tomorrow.
Yeah.

33:30.425 --> 33:31.968
Something else didn't
sit right with me,

33:31.968 --> 33:34.387
so I went over the traffic cam
footage near the shooting.

33:34.387 --> 33:36.806
Guess whose plates
are a match.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.060
Border Patrol Agent Wells.

33:40.060 --> 33:43.521
(phone ringing)

33:43.521 --> 33:45.523
Murtaugh?

33:45.523 --> 33:46.524
MURTAUGH:
Bailey.

33:46.524 --> 33:48.777
Ana Mendoza stole my car.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.862
I need you to find her before
she gets into more trouble.

33:50.862 --> 33:51.863
I got it.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.448
Also, Murtaugh, one more thing.

33:53.448 --> 33:56.117
I think I know who was
shooting at us in the desert.

34:05.210 --> 34:06.336
Jose?

34:19.099 --> 34:20.725
(groans)

34:20.725 --> 34:21.768
Hey!

34:21.768 --> 34:22.686
Where are you taking him?

34:25.563 --> 34:28.441
(groaning)

34:28.441 --> 34:29.776
Cole, what are you doing
out of bed?

34:29.776 --> 34:32.112
It's the same boots
from the desert; it's them.

34:32.112 --> 34:34.155
Cole, you have to go
back to your room.

34:34.155 --> 34:36.116
Nat, call security.
They can't leave the building.

34:36.116 --> 34:37.701
Cole!

34:45.667 --> 34:46.960
Ana.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.170
If you needed a ride,

34:49.170 --> 34:51.298
you just had to ask.

34:51.298 --> 34:53.425
Detective Murtaugh.

34:53.425 --> 34:56.136
And you are...

34:56.136 --> 34:59.431
Wade Dykstra,
L.A. Tribune reporter.

34:59.431 --> 35:00.849
I'm sorry, I'm gonna need
to talk to Ana alone

35:00.849 --> 35:02.517
about her father's story.

35:02.517 --> 35:05.186
How, uh, corrupt Border Patrol
agents are taking bribes

35:05.186 --> 35:06.980
from coyotes?
That's the one.

35:06.980 --> 35:11.151
And all six-foot-five,
250 pounds of you

35:11.151 --> 35:13.111
are writing it?
Well, I am,

35:13.111 --> 35:15.822
as soon as you--
Ow! What the hell, man?!

35:15.822 --> 35:18.658
Sorry, but I'm tired of
people lying to me today.

35:18.658 --> 35:21.036
There's no chance
you are Wade Dykstra

35:21.036 --> 35:22.996
from the L.A. Tribune.

35:22.996 --> 35:24.622
Ah-ah-ah.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:24.622 --> 35:26.291
Take my wallet.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.542
All right, look at my ID.

35:27.542 --> 35:30.086
I'm Wade Dykstra.

35:36.009 --> 35:37.844
Wade.

35:37.844 --> 35:39.512
You should have said something.

35:39.512 --> 35:41.222
Come here, let me
help you up, man.

35:41.222 --> 35:43.683
Maybe we could keep
this little misunderstanding

35:43.683 --> 35:44.684
out of the story.
Look out!

35:45.518 --> 35:46.269
Get inside!

36:10.418 --> 36:12.045
Let him go!

36:12.045 --> 36:13.588
Go, go, go!

36:13.588 --> 36:15.256
(tires screeching)

36:17.467 --> 36:18.635
(grunts)

36:24.474 --> 36:25.642
(clicks empty)

36:34.859 --> 36:37.195
(tires screeching)

36:47.205 --> 36:48.957
Bailey.

36:50.458 --> 36:53.253
I think you're all grown up now.

36:53.253 --> 36:54.546
(tires screeching)

36:56.798 --> 36:58.341
I'm not letting go!

37:04.723 --> 37:05.723
Gun!

37:09.436 --> 37:10.562
(screams)

37:14.315 --> 37:15.984
(groaning)

37:31.791 --> 37:33.376
(sirens wailing)

37:37.297 --> 37:38.631
Drop the weapon!

37:38.631 --> 37:41.092
Put your hands in the air
where I can see 'em!

37:41.092 --> 37:42.093
Get 'em up now!

37:42.093 --> 37:43.636
Get your hands up!

37:43.636 --> 37:45.388
Stay there!
Don't move!

37:52.103 --> 37:53.480
Move in, move in!

37:53.480 --> 37:54.481
Take the weapon!

37:54.481 --> 37:56.107
Weapon secure.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.108
Hey, Nat.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.360
(sighs)
Cole.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.946
I might have a few more injuries
for you to check out.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.406
(coughs)
Ah.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.828
The Mendoza family has been
granted political asylum

38:08.828 --> 38:12.081
in the U.S., and the LAPD
will continue to do everything

38:12.081 --> 38:14.626
in our power to end
the kind of corruption

38:14.626 --> 38:16.252
that Mr. Mendoza was
brave enough to expose.
(mouthing)

38:16.252 --> 38:18.922
I'll now take a few
of your questions.
(chuckles)

38:18.922 --> 38:21.549
I'd be proud of myself, too.

38:21.549 --> 38:23.510
It was the right thing to do.

38:23.510 --> 38:24.010
Hey,

38:24.010 --> 38:26.387
thanks for saving us
out there in the desert.

38:26.387 --> 38:28.389
And for the future,
I will keep you

38:28.389 --> 38:29.557
in the loop.
No, you won't.

38:29.557 --> 38:31.059
No, I won't.
But thank you.

38:31.059 --> 38:32.227
You try the Roquefort?

38:32.227 --> 38:33.561
Oh, my God.
Oh, it's heavenly.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.939
I can't believe you
held on to all of this.

38:35.939 --> 38:39.025
Captain, Detective Murtaugh.

38:39.025 --> 38:40.360
Is that the file
I asked you for?

38:40.360 --> 38:41.861
Yeah. Who is this guy?

38:41.861 --> 38:44.113
Don't you worry about that.

38:44.113 --> 38:46.199
You are
on a need-to-know basis.

38:46.199 --> 38:48.326
Okay.

38:49.702 --> 38:51.579
Hey, Roger.

38:51.579 --> 38:53.373
You sure you want to know
what's in that file?

38:56.876 --> 39:01.047
Honestly...
I don't know anymore.

39:12.267 --> 39:13.601
(sighs)

39:13.601 --> 39:15.603
Well, if it isn't my first wife.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.524
You were not supposed
to find out like that.

39:23.278 --> 39:24.779
So you were married before.

39:24.779 --> 39:26.739
Who cares?

39:26.739 --> 39:28.992
We both have pasts.

39:28.992 --> 39:31.953
But we're married now.

39:31.953 --> 39:33.496
Happily married.

39:33.496 --> 39:37.125
Trish, I want you to know
that you can tell me anything.

39:37.125 --> 39:40.128
I already have
a partner at work

39:40.128 --> 39:42.130
that-that has trust issues.

39:42.130 --> 39:43.381
I don't need that at home.

39:45.883 --> 39:46.801
I love you.

39:50.138 --> 39:52.265
I love you so much.

39:52.265 --> 39:54.183
I love you, too.

39:57.562 --> 40:00.982
Roger... what's that?

40:02.483 --> 40:04.569
That?

40:04.569 --> 40:06.988
That's a file on your ex.

40:06.988 --> 40:08.906
(sighs)

40:08.906 --> 40:10.700
Did you read it?

40:15.330 --> 40:17.165
A butcher.

40:17.165 --> 40:19.125
What?

40:19.125 --> 40:21.878
No, I didn't open it.

40:21.878 --> 40:23.129
But I was sitting here thinking,

40:23.129 --> 40:24.839
"What kind of guy
could this be?"

40:24.839 --> 40:27.342
And that's what I came up with.

40:27.342 --> 40:29.177
A big, jolly butcher.
(laughs)

40:29.177 --> 40:31.596
With four missing fingers.
(laughing)

40:31.596 --> 40:34.682
And a walleye. That's why he
keeps cutting his fingers off.

40:34.682 --> 40:37.310
Who loves to go fishing,

40:37.310 --> 40:39.979
to get rid of the smell
of the butcher shop.

40:39.979 --> 40:41.648
With fish? Okay.
With fish.

40:41.648 --> 40:43.316
And he's married now.

40:43.316 --> 40:44.692
Oh.
And he's got kids.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.903
And they live in...
Van Nuys.

40:46.903 --> 40:48.696
Van Nuys.
He's a Van Nuys guy.

40:48.696 --> 40:50.865
But you know, they're
very happy together.

40:50.865 --> 40:53.201
Very happy.
