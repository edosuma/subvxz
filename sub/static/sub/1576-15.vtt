20:05.595 --> 20:07.462
So I booked us a cruise home.

20:10.199 --> 20:13.368
We moved in to a brand-new
house in Sherman Oaks--

20:13.370 --> 20:15.804
<i>the good part,</i>
<i>south of the boulevard--</i>

20:15.806 --> 20:17.873
<i>where we could live</i>
<i>as a happy couple.</i>

20:17.875 --> 20:19.374
WALDEN:
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

20:19.376 --> 20:21.476
You bought a house
with a dungeon?

20:21.478 --> 20:23.078
And a pit?

20:23.080 --> 20:24.379
Of course not.

20:24.381 --> 20:25.814
I had it remodeled.

20:25.816 --> 20:28.283
The permit process
was just a nightmare.

20:28.285 --> 20:29.952
Next time,
use my pit guy.

20:29.954 --> 20:31.386
He's the best.

For the next four years,

<i>magical lovemaking.</i>

20:46.136 --> 20:50.739
<i>Then, a few days ago,</i>
<i>the unthinkable happened.</i>

20:50.741 --> 20:52.307
<i>Somehow, he managed</i>
<i>to make a rope</i>

20:52.309 --> 20:54.576
out of his bowling shirts
<i>and ran away,</i>

20:54.578 --> 20:56.979

24:55.133 --> 24:58.801
12 years ago,
your wife kicked you out,

24:58.803 --> 25:01.971
and then you and your dumb son
moved in with your brother.

25:03.473 --> 25:05.941
Uh, uh, he wasn't dumb
at the beginning.

25:05.943 --> 25:08.677
Uh, he got dumb later on.

What happened?

Uh, well, turned out
it was funnier.

25:12.583 --> 25:13.983
All right.

25:13.985 --> 25:15.818
So your brother then
let you stay there

25:15.820 --> 25:17.720
eight and a half years
rent-free,

25:17.722 --> 25:19.788
even though you claim
that he never liked you.

25:19.790 --> 25:23.559
Ah. Ah, you're not the only one
to point out the illogic.

25:24.961 --> 25:28.597
And this brother of yours
supposedly died in Paris

25:28.599 --> 25:30.533
under mysterious circumstances.

25:30.535 --> 25:31.901
It wasn't all that mysterious.

25:31.903 --> 25:33.769
I mean, he was taking
a lot of drugs

25:33.771 --> 25:36.105
and pissed off almost everybody.

25:37.240 --> 25:39.642
And then you tried
to drown yourself,

25:39.644 --> 25:43.078
but you changed your mind
because the water was too cold.

25:45.615 --> 25:48.651
And then you got into his house
and offered to buy it.

25:48.653 --> 25:52.388
It seemed like a good
idea at the time.

25:52.390 --> 25:57.293
And then you let him and his son
stay there for four more years.

25:57.295 --> 25:58.561
Right.

25:58.563 --> 25:59.595
Rent-free.

26:00.697 --> 26:02.364
Well, when you say
it like that,

26:02.366 --> 26:05.301
it sounds ridiculous.

26:05.303 --> 26:06.702
And then your dead brother's

26:06.704 --> 26:08.871
previously unknown
lesbian daughter shows up,

26:08.873 --> 26:10.673
and then you let her move in.

26:10.675 --> 26:13.342
(chuckles) You can't
write this stuff, huh?

26:14.644 --> 26:17.313
And then the two of you
got married to each other.

26:19.249 --> 26:21.250
Yes.

26:21.252 --> 26:22.351
But you're not gay.

26:22.353 --> 26:24.253
Well, I'm not.

26:25.288 --> 26:27.723
And then you adopted
a black child.

26:27.725 --> 26:30.159
Ah, ah, he's, uh...
he's more Eurasian.

26:30.161 --> 26:31.694
Uh...

26:33.196 --> 26:35.664
Oh, what a sweetie pie.

26:37.867 --> 26:39.702
And the two of you
are now divorced?

26:39.704 --> 26:40.569

26:40.571 --> 26:41.570
But you're living together.

26:41.572 --> 26:44.540

the whole thing falls apart.

26:45.575 --> 26:47.042
Yeah, of course.

26:47.044 --> 26:50.179
Uh, and now the woman
who stalked your brother

26:50.181 --> 26:51.647
and then married him

26:51.649 --> 26:53.649
all of a sudden shows up
and she says

26:53.651 --> 26:56.452
that he's not dead after all,
that she has been keeping him

26:56.454 --> 26:58.854

26:58.856 --> 27:00.122

uh, south of the boulevard.

27:04.761 --> 27:06.028

27:06.030 --> 27:07.963

Oh, and don't forget
the chasin' knife.

27:10.001 --> 27:11.467
Oh, and the
threatening text.

27:11.469 --> 27:12.968
He said, uh,
"I'm coming home,

27:12.970 --> 27:14.536
and you're gonna pay."

27:14.538 --> 27:16.138

27:16.140 --> 27:19.108
'Cause you said he doesn't pay
for anything.

27:21.845 --> 27:23.212

27:23.214 --> 27:25.481
