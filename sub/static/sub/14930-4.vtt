WEBVTT

00:04.405 --> 00:05.573
WATCH OUT!
OOF!

00:05.606 --> 00:07.241
LILY, I'M SORRY.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.377
I WAS PLAYING CATCH
WITH TAYA.

00:09.410 --> 00:12.280
TAYA

00:12.313 --> 00:13.647
RIGHT THERE.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.416
THROW IT BACK!

00:15.449 --> 00:17.818
I CAN'T REACH!

00:17.851 --> 00:19.620
COME CLOSER!

00:19.653 --> 00:20.588
YOU'RE LUCKY.

00:20.621 --> 00:24.492
YOUR GIRLFRIEND
CAN REALLY THROW
THINGS FAR!

00:24.525 --> 00:26.627
I KNOW! SHE'S EVEN
BETTER AT KICKING.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.396
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE HEARD,

00:28.429 --> 00:30.564
BUT SHE'S TRYING OUT
FOR THE FOOTBALL TEAM.

00:30.598 --> 00:34.602
WOW! SO YOU MAY
WIND UP MAKING OUT
WITH A FOOTBALL PLAYER.

00:34.635 --> 00:38.406
WHICH IS WEIRD,
'CAUSE THAT WAS ALWAYS
ONE OF YOUR FEARS.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.141
HEY, LILY.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.075
HEY, WHAT'S UP, BABE?

00:41.109 --> 00:44.078
WHOO. I'M GONNA
GO HIT THE SHOWERS,
BABE.

00:44.112 --> 00:45.179
OK, BABE.

00:45.213 --> 00:45.879
BYE.

00:45.913 --> 00:48.249
YOU GOTTA LET ME
CLENCH FIRST.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.351
IT'S HOW HOUDINI
DIED.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.385
HA.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.754
WELL, YOU TWO
ARE QUITE THE
AFFECTIONATE COUPLE.

00:53.787 --> 00:57.658
I'M SORRY.
IS THAT WEIRD, ME AND TAYA
KISSING IN FRONT OF YOU?

00:57.691 --> 01:00.428
NO! I LOVE IT!

01:00.461 --> 01:03.131
I MEAN, YOU GUYS
CAN KISS AND TOSS

01:03.164 --> 01:06.234
AND SLAP ASS
ALL YOU WANT.
IT'S FINE WITH ME.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.736
REALLY? 'CAUSE I DON'T
WANT IT TO BE AWKWARD,

01:08.769 --> 01:11.505
YOU KNOW, YOU LIVING
RIGHT BETWEEN US.

01:11.539 --> 01:14.108
BRAD, PLEASE.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

01:14.142 --> 01:16.877
THERE IS NOTHING
AWKWARD ABOUT IT.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.146
WE HAVE TO MOVE.

01:18.179 --> 01:22.383
ALL RIGHT. I GUESS
WE'D BETTER BUY SOME
BOXES AND START PACKING.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.651
YEAH. I'LL CALL
THE MOVING COMPANY.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.586
OH, WAIT. WE DON'T HAVE
ANOTHER HOUSE.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.188
BUT LILY SAYS
WE HAVE TO MOVE.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.123
WELL, WE COULD PUT
OUR STUFF IN STORAGE.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.459
LET ME GO THROUGH
THE REAL ESTATE SECTION.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.161
OH!

01:36.164 --> 01:38.098
UH...EDDIE?

01:39.500 --> 01:42.270
EDDIE!

01:42.936 --> 01:44.772
HEY.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.141
WHERE ARE YOU COMIN' FROM?

01:47.175 --> 01:47.908
THE BASEMENT.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.843
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN THE BASEMENT?

01:49.877 --> 01:51.212
HANGING OUT.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.247
IN YOUR BATHROBE?

01:53.847 --> 01:55.283
YEAH, YOU KNOW.

01:55.316 --> 01:59.287
OH, MY GOD. I GOT IT.
YOU'RE LIVING HERE.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.789
SOMEONE IN HERE?

02:03.824 --> 02:07.161
EDDIE, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?
IT'S 3:00 IN THE MORNING.

02:07.195 --> 02:11.465
I COULDN'T SLEEP,
SO I CAME OVER
TO USE THE BATHROOM.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.236
HEY, ED, YOU--

02:15.269 --> 02:16.437
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:16.470 --> 02:18.372
RINSING OUT
THESE PANS.

02:18.406 --> 02:22.210
SEAN, IS IT OK IF I KEEP
MY TERRARIUM HERE?

02:22.243 --> 02:24.745
YEAH, SURE, GO AHEAD.

02:28.316 --> 02:32.320
THIS IS ALL
ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE.
YOU CAN'T PROVE IT.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.421
GOD, I KNEW IT.

02:33.454 --> 02:36.757
ALL RIGHT, YOUR CASE
JUST GOT A LITTLE BIT
STRONGER.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.226
YOU'RE KIDDING!

02:38.259 --> 02:39.593
ALL RIGHT,
I'M LIVING HERE,

02:39.627 --> 02:41.762
BUT YOU'RE GONNA
BE REALLY HAPPY

02:41.795 --> 02:43.331
WHEN YOU FIND OUT WHY.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.599
DID YOU KILL SOMEONE?

02:45.633 --> 02:47.735
I'M SAVING UP
TO BUY A HOUSE.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.303
OH, THAT'S GREAT!

02:49.337 --> 02:50.904
YOU GOT EVICTED,
DIDN'T YOU?

02:50.938 --> 02:53.274
AND I'M SAVING UP
TO BUY A HOUSE.

02:53.307 --> 02:56.544
YEAH, UH,
I DON'T KNOW, EDDIE.

02:56.577 --> 02:57.778
YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW
I'M HERE.

02:57.811 --> 03:00.981
I'VE BEEN HERE A WEEK
ALREADY, AND YOU
HAVEN'T EVEN NOTICED.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.216
A WEEK?

03:02.250 --> 03:04.318
YEAH. WHAT'S TODAY? SUNDAY.
TOMORROW'S MONDAY.
YEAH. 3 WEEKS.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.986
WE CAN'T PUT HIM
OUT ON THE STREET.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.721
HE HAS BEEN
KINDA QUIET.

03:07.755 --> 03:10.324
JUST HOLD ON!
WE HAVE A LOT GOING ON.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.926
WE HAVE A BABY COMING.
I'M GOING TO SCHOOL.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.829
I GOTTA SAY NO.
I'M SORRY.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.030
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL
ABOUT THIS?

03:17.064 --> 03:21.835
I SHOT A PORN
IN YOUR HOUSE, AND YOU
DIDN'T OBJECT TO THAT.

03:21.869 --> 03:22.836
WE DIDN'T KNOW.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.805
WHEN WE FOUND OUT,
WE KICKED YOU OUT,
REMEMBER?

03:24.838 --> 03:28.909
BABY, HE HAS BEEN
KINDA QUIET.
HE CAN'T BE HOMELESS.

03:28.942 --> 03:29.843
OH!

03:29.877 --> 03:32.346
FINE, FINE.
YOU CAN STAY.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.681
BUT I'M SERIOUS,
IF HE SCREWS UP,

03:33.714 --> 03:35.916
YOU'RE LIVIN' DOWN HERE
WITH HIM.

03:35.949 --> 03:36.850
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.487
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
THE FUTON'S A DOUBLE.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.955
OH, NO, NO, NO.
I'M NOT GONNA BE
STAYIN' DOWN HERE

03:41.989 --> 03:44.258
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
BE COOL, YOU GOT IT?

03:44.292 --> 03:45.726
YEAH, YEAH. I GOT IT.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.995
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS,
A TERRARIUM?

03:48.028 --> 03:49.863
YOU GOT A SNAKE
OR SOMETHING?

03:49.897 --> 03:52.333
I GOT A SNAKE.
IT'S A 6-FOOT
BURMESE PYTHON.

03:52.366 --> 03:53.834
NO, YOU HAVE
AN EMPTY TERRARIUM.

03:53.867 --> 03:57.638
OH. YOU MIGHT WANNA KEEP
THAT DOOR CLOSED.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.588
HEY, BABE, WHERE
YOU BEEN ALL DAY?

04:14.622 --> 04:16.757
PICKED UP THE DRY CLEANING,
EXCHANGED THE CAR SEAT,

04:16.790 --> 04:18.659
BOUGHT A BATTERY
FOR THE PHONE, GROCERIES,

04:18.692 --> 04:20.861
AND FINALLY PICKED UP
THIS OLD ROLL OF FILM.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.095
MAN, I AM EXHAUSTED.

04:22.129 --> 04:25.499
YOU KNOW, YOU GOTTA
START LETTING ME DO
SOME OF THIS STUFF.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.034
WHY? I ALWAYS DO
THIS STUFF.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.001
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE
PREGNANT NOW

04:28.035 --> 04:30.037
AND IT'S TIME TO SLOW DOWN
AND SHARE THE LOAD.

04:30.070 --> 04:33.441
OK. JUST 'CAUSE
I'M PREGNANT DOESN'T
MEAN I'M INCOMPETENT.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.376
HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN
JIMMY AROUND?

04:35.409 --> 04:37.010
OH, DAMN IT!
I FORGOT HIM!

04:37.044 --> 04:40.414
I TOOK HIM
TO SPORTS SHACK
TO BUY SOME WEIGHTS.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.416
I FORGOT
TO PICK HIM UP.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.517
OH, GOD.

04:43.551 --> 04:44.518
HEY.

04:44.552 --> 04:45.919
I'M SORRY.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.055
IT'S FINE. I WALKED HOME.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.490
FROM SPORTS SHACK?

04:49.523 --> 04:50.891
HONEY, WHERE
ARE YOUR WEIGHTS?

04:50.924 --> 04:52.025
WELL...

04:52.059 --> 04:54.728
THE 15-POUND WEIGHTS
ARE ABOUT A BLOCK
FROM THE STORE,

04:54.762 --> 04:58.065
AND THEN I GAVE UP
THE 10-POUND WEIGHTS
A MILE AFTER THAT.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.934
THEN I DRAGGED
THAT BAR FOR 2 MILES
TILL IT FELL DOWN A GRATE.

05:00.968 --> 05:04.972
HONEY, I'M SO SORRY.
I'LL TAKE YOU BACK.
WE'LL GET MORE WEIGHTS.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.774
OW--OW.

05:06.807 --> 05:07.508
IT'S FINE.

05:07.541 --> 05:10.978
I THINK I'M DONE
LIFTING WEIGHTS.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.947
OH, GOD, I FEEL HORRIBLE.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.817
THAT'S IT. I'M GONNA
START DOING MORE
AROUND HERE.

05:16.850 --> 05:20.888
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
HELP ME, ALL RIGHT?
I JUST FORGOT ONE THING!

05:20.921 --> 05:21.989
YEAH, OUR SON.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.023
AND HE CAME BACK!

05:23.056 --> 05:28.862
IT WAS JUST
ONE LITTLE LAPSE, REALLY.
I'M FINE.

05:28.896 --> 05:32.400
ARE YOU WEARING
2 DIFFERENT SHOES?

05:33.967 --> 05:36.069
YES, I AM.

05:38.606 --> 05:41.709
I THINK IT'S GREAT
THAT TAYA'S TRYING OUT
FOR THE FOOTBALL TEAM.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.411
TOTALLY. I HOPE
SHE MAKES IT.

05:43.444 --> 05:46.013
HA HA. WELL,
THIS MAY JUST BE
THE FEMINIST IN ME,

05:46.046 --> 05:48.782
BUT I THINK SHE'S
SETTING US BACK
20 YEARS.

05:48.816 --> 05:49.650
HOW?

05:49.683 --> 05:50.451
IT'S OBVIOUS.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.553
SHE TRIES OUT
FOR THE FOOTBALL TEAM,

05:52.586 --> 05:54.154
THEN A GUY TRIES OUT
FOR THE DANCE SQUAD.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.490
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
WE'RE BAREFOOT
AND PREGNANT,

05:56.524 --> 05:58.025
WATCHING OUR HUSBANDS
DANCE AT A PEP RALLY.

05:58.058 --> 06:01.629
SUSAN B. ANTHONY
DID NOT GIVE UP
HER SEAT ON THE BUS

06:01.662 --> 06:02.730
FOR THAT.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.466
I'M NOT SURE
THAT'S RIGHT.

06:05.499 --> 06:06.600
TRUST ME! IT IS.

06:06.634 --> 06:10.003
NOW, WE'VE A PEP
RALLY TO GET READY
FOR,

06:10.037 --> 06:11.639
SO LET'S WORK IT.

06:11.672 --> 06:12.973
I'M NOT SURE HOW TAYA--

06:13.006 --> 06:14.542
I SAID WORK IT!

06:14.575 --> 06:16.944
IS THE DISHWASHER
RUNNING?
NO. WHY?

06:16.977 --> 06:18.145
THERE'S NO HOT WATER.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.113
OH, YEAH. I TOOK
A COLD SHOWER THIS MORNING.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.348
I MEANT TO CALL
THE PLUMBER. I FORGOT.

06:21.381 --> 06:25.453
BEFORE YOU DO,
LET ME CHECK THE WATER
HEATER IN THE BASEMENT.

06:26.754 --> 06:27.621
HEY, GIRLS.

06:27.655 --> 06:29.022
DAD, I HAVE GUESTS!

06:29.056 --> 06:30.791
I KNOW.
OH, HEY, GINA,

06:30.824 --> 06:33.727
DID YOUR DAD GET
THAT SHED BUILT?

06:33.761 --> 06:36.129
DAD, WE ARE VERY BUSY!

06:36.163 --> 06:37.030
SO AM I.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.632
DO YOU HAVE A PEP RALLY
TO GET READY FOR?

06:38.666 --> 06:40.634
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I DO.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.570
* SPIRIT, SPIRIT

06:42.603 --> 06:44.137
DAD, STOP IT!

06:44.171 --> 06:46.106
I'M GOING!

06:47.007 --> 06:48.609
WHAT, YOU DON'T KNOCK?

06:48.642 --> 06:52.079
YEAH, SORRY TO BARGE
INTO MY OWN HOUSE LIKE THIS.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.146
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:53.180 --> 06:54.848
HOT WATER HEATER'S
BUSTED.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.984
NO, IT'S FINE.
I TURNED IT OFF.

06:57.017 --> 06:57.951
WHY WOULD YOU
TURN IT OFF?

06:57.985 --> 07:00.654
BECAUSE IT WAS TOO NOISY.
ALL THAT CLANGING--

07:00.688 --> 07:02.856
IT WAS GIVING ME DREAMS
ABOUT ROBOTS.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.192
LOOK, I CAN'T TELL CLAUDIA
SHE CAN'T TAKE A SHOWER

07:05.225 --> 07:06.627
'CAUSE YOU'RE HAVING
ROBOT DREAMS.

07:06.660 --> 07:10.063
FINE. JUST TELL ME
WHEN SHE'S TAKING A SHOWER,
AND I'LL TURN IT BACK ON.

07:10.097 --> 07:13.734
HOW ABOUT THIS,
IF THIS IS MORE
CONVENIENT FOR YOU--

07:13.767 --> 07:15.503
SHE CAN RUN THROUGH
THE SPRINKLERS.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.738
THAT'S BETWEEN
YOU AND HER.

07:17.771 --> 07:21.542
ALL RIGHT, WATCH IT, PAL,
'CAUSE YOUR ASS ISN'T
THE ONLY ONE

07:21.575 --> 07:24.111
THAT'S ON THE LINE HERE.

07:24.144 --> 07:27.080
SHE'S AFTER ME, TOO!

07:31.685 --> 07:33.921
SORRY.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.825
THIS IS NO WAY TO LIVE.

07:38.526 --> 07:39.627
HEY, DID YOU FIGURE OUT
WHAT WAS WRONG?

07:39.660 --> 07:43.897
OH, YEAH, UH, THERE WAS
JUST A CARBON POLOXIDE
BUILDUP

07:43.931 --> 07:46.834
ON THE FLUX INTAKE VALVE,
SO I CHIPPED IT OFF.

07:46.867 --> 07:50.638
I HEARD LIE, LIE, LIE,
I CHIPPED IT OFF.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.073
ALL RIGHT. THE NOISE
WAS BOTHERING EDDIE--

07:53.106 --> 07:55.643
SO HE TURNED OFF
OUR WATER HEATER?

07:55.676 --> 07:57.578
OK. THAT'S STRIKE ONE.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.279
I KNOW. THAT'S WHAT
I TOLD HIM.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.749
HE'S NOT GONNA
DO IT AGAIN,

08:01.782 --> 08:03.517
CERTAINLY NOT
2 MORE TIMES.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.252
JIMMY, LISTEN,
I'M SO SORRY

08:05.285 --> 08:06.286
I FORGOT
TO PICK YOU UP.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.622
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO MAKE IT
UP TO YOU?

08:08.656 --> 08:10.023
DRIVE ME TO MY CLASS
PICNIC TOMORROW

08:10.057 --> 08:12.259
SO I DON'T HAVE TO CARRY
ALL THAT MACARONI SALAD.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.061
OH, DAMN IT,
THE MACARONI SALAD.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.729
DID YOU FORGET
TO MAKE IT?

08:15.763 --> 08:16.864
NO, NO,
I DIDN'T FORGET.

08:16.897 --> 08:19.900
I JUST HAVE TO GO
BUY ALL THE INGREDIENTS
AND COOK IT.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.603
BABY, IF IT'S TOO MUCH,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

08:22.636 --> 08:25.205
IT'S NOT TOO MUCH.
JUST 'CAUSE I'M PREGNANT

08:25.238 --> 08:27.140
DOES NOT MEAN EVERYTHING
GRINDS TO A HALT, OK?

08:27.174 --> 08:29.710
I CAN MAKE MACARONI
SALAD FOR MY SON'S
CLASS PICNIC.

08:29.743 --> 08:32.946
HOW MANY KIDS
ARE THERE GONNA BE,
JIM, LIKE 25?

08:32.980 --> 08:35.215
NO. IT'S MY WHOLE GRADE,
SO, LIKE, 90.

08:35.248 --> 08:35.983
OH. PERFECT.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.985
90? YOU'RE GONNA COOK
FOR 90 KIDS?

08:38.018 --> 08:40.921
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE EXHAUSTED.

08:40.954 --> 08:43.791
I AM. IT'S FINE, THOUGH,
OK? I MAKE THE MACARONI
SALAD EVERY YEAR,

08:43.824 --> 08:45.826
AND THERE'S NO REASON
THIS YEAR SHOULD BE
DIFFERENT.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.862
YEAH, BECAUSE YOU'RE
PREGNANT THIS YEAR.
THAT'S WHY IT'S DIFFERENT.

08:48.896 --> 08:49.730
LET ME HELP. LET ME COOK.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.565
NO, THANK YOU. COOKING
IS NOT YOUR STUFF.

08:51.599 --> 08:54.134
COOKING IS MY STUFF.
THAT IS YOUR STUFF.
WHAT?

08:54.167 --> 08:57.270
THAT. YOU WANNA SHIFT
YOUR TOWEL A LITTLE BIT
THERE, SPANKY?

08:57.304 --> 08:59.172
OH, SORRY.

09:00.340 --> 09:01.642
HEY, GUYS!

09:01.675 --> 09:03.844
CUT, CUT!

09:03.877 --> 09:05.045
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.079
BRAD, WE'RE
A LITTLE BIT BUSY.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.849
I KNOW, I KNOW.
I PROMISE, THIS
WON'T TAKE LONG.

09:08.882 --> 09:09.917
WE HAVE GREAT NEWS!

09:09.950 --> 09:11.619
ACTUALLY,
TAYA HAS GREAT NEWS.

09:11.652 --> 09:12.820
NO, NO, NO. MAYBE
YOU SHOULD TELL IT.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.187
ARE YOU SURE, BABE?
IT'S YOUR NEWS.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.723
OK. WE'LL TELL IT
TOGETHER.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.358
STOP IT AND TELL
THE DAMN NEWS!

09:18.391 --> 09:19.292
OK. WELL, I--

09:19.326 --> 09:21.328
TAYA'S THE NEW KICKER
ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM!

09:21.361 --> 09:22.229
OH, MY GOD!
AAH!

09:22.262 --> 09:26.366
WELL, THAT'S GREAT NEWS.
OK, FROM THE TOP.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.334
THAT'S AMAZING!

09:27.367 --> 09:29.302
IT'S GOOD FOR ME, TOO.
GOOD-BYE, SCIENCE GEEK.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.304
HELLO, FOOTBALL PLAYER'S
BOYFRIEND!

09:41.749 --> 09:43.684
MOM, CAN I TALK TO YOU?

09:43.717 --> 09:44.584
OK, MAKE IT QUICK.

09:44.618 --> 09:48.021
OK. FIRST OF ALL,
I DON'T CARE ABOUT BRAD

09:48.055 --> 09:50.323
AND I DON'T CARE
THAT HE HAS A NEW GIRLFRIEND.

09:50.357 --> 09:53.260
AND I DON'T CARE
THAT SHE MADE THE STUPID
FOOTBALL TEAM

09:53.293 --> 09:56.363
AND EVERYBODY LOVES HER
'CAUSE SHE'S SO
FRICKIN' HISTORIC!

09:56.396 --> 09:57.731
SO YOU DON'T CARE.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.867
OF COURSE I CARE!
WEREN'T YOU LISTENING?

09:59.900 --> 10:02.402
LILY, I'M TRYING
TO DECIDE WHICH SPEECH
TO GIVE YOU

10:02.435 --> 10:05.072
BECAUSE I HAVE TO MAKE
MACARONI SALAD
FOR 90 KIDS

10:05.105 --> 10:06.874
AND I ONLY HAVE
A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME,

10:06.907 --> 10:10.043
SO I'M GONNA GO WITH
THIS ONE AND HOPE
THAT IT APPLIES.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.312
OK. YOU NEED TO BE
THE BIGGER PERSON

10:12.345 --> 10:14.247
AND GO OUT THERE
AND BE HAPPY FOR HER.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.683
JUST BECAUSE EVERYONE'S
NOTICING TAYA NOW

10:15.716 --> 10:19.352
DOES NOT MEAN THEY STOP
NOTICING WHAT A STAR YOU ARE
ON THE DANCE SQUAD.

10:19.386 --> 10:23.056
SO YOU GO OUT THERE
AND YOU SHAKE WHAT
YOUR MAMA GAVE YOU,

10:23.090 --> 10:24.291
'CAUSE IT'S WHAT
I GAVE YA.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.993
AND IF YOU ARE DANCING
YOUR HEART OUT,

10:26.026 --> 10:29.963
NO ONE'S GONNA EVEN
NOTICE THAT AMAZON
AND HER LONG LEGS.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.865
YOU NOTICED HER LEGS?

10:31.899 --> 10:34.267
YES! AND HOW GROSS
THEY ARE.

10:34.301 --> 10:37.304
THEY ARE WAY TOO
LONG.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.006
THANKS, MOM.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.841
SO NOW THAT TAYA'S
ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM,

10:40.874 --> 10:42.843
I WAS THINKING I COULD
JOIN THE DANCE SQUAD.

10:42.876 --> 10:46.046
I'VE BEEN WORKING
ON MY KRUMPING. CHECK IT.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.148
BRAD, NO KRUMPING.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.083
OK? BREAK'S OVER,
GIRLS.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.854
I'M SORRY. TAYA,
WE'RE ALL VERY PROUD
OF YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENT,

10:53.887 --> 10:56.356
BUT YOU AND KRUMPY
ARE GONNA HAVE TO LEAVE.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.025
WE HAVE A DANCE
TO PRACTICE.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.093
ACTUALLY, LILY,
SINCE THIS IS SO HISTORIC,

11:00.127 --> 11:03.463
WE WERE THINKING
WE'D MAKE OUR DANCE
IN HONOR OF TAYA!

11:03.496 --> 11:05.733
YOU REALLY DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.034
AND WE WON'T.

11:07.067 --> 11:07.801
WHY NOT?

11:07.835 --> 11:10.170
BECAUSE WE ALREADY
HAVE A ROUTINE,

11:10.203 --> 11:11.338
AND IT'S TOO
LAST-MINUTE.

11:11.371 --> 11:15.208
SO WE'LL CHANGE IT.
WE STILL HAVE ALL NIGHT
TO PRACTICE.

11:15.242 --> 11:17.444
YEAH!
YEAH, LET'S DO IT!

11:19.079 --> 11:21.348
FINE! FINE, FINE.

11:21.381 --> 11:24.317
WE WILL DO A SPECIAL
DANCE FOR TAYA.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.886
ALL RIGHT!

11:26.286 --> 11:28.055
NO KRUMPING, BRAD!

11:42.335 --> 11:44.037
ED! WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING, MAN?

11:44.071 --> 11:48.341
I'M HAVING A FUND-RAISER
TO GENERATE SOME CASH
FOR MY NEW PLACE.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.044
YOU CAN'T HAVE
FUND-RAISERS HERE, MAN.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.246
WELL, NOW YOU'RE JUST
MAKING UP RULES
AS YOU GO ALONG.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.316
YOU ARE PUTTING ME
IN A ROUGH SPOT!

11:56.349 --> 11:57.617
YOU GOT THAT?

11:57.650 --> 12:01.154
YOU SAW CLAUDIA.
SHE WASN'T JUST WARNING YOU.
SHE WAS WARNING ME.

12:01.188 --> 12:04.191
AND IF SHE FINDS OUT
ABOUT THIS THING,
SHE'S GONNA--

12:04.224 --> 12:05.292
YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.360
MMM! THIS IS GOOD!

12:07.394 --> 12:09.863
YEAH, I MADE 'EM.
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE RECIPE.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.265
THANKS. YOU BETTER STOP
SCREWING UP, MAN.

12:12.299 --> 12:15.135
I SWEAR...
THIS IS THE LAST THING.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.771
IT BETTER BE.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.274
DO I DETECT
A HINT OF PAPRIKA?

12:21.308 --> 12:22.442
JUST A TOUCH.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.778
IT'S NICE.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.315
WHOA, BABE, THAT'S
A LOTTA LAUNDRY.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.217
SAME AMOUNT
I ALWAYS DO.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.084
CAN I HELP?

12:31.118 --> 12:32.920
NO. 'CAUSE YOU BALL UP
ALL THE UNDERWEAR

12:32.953 --> 12:33.887
AND GET IT ALL WRINKLY.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.055
THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF UNDERWEAR--

12:35.088 --> 12:38.291
WHEN YOU WEAR IT,
YOU DE-WRINKLE IT
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.227
I'M IRONING A PAIR
RIGHT NOW.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.796
WHAT ARE YOU EATING?

12:42.830 --> 12:44.264
IS THAT
A DEVILED EGG?

12:44.297 --> 12:46.066
UH--IT COULD BE.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.101
WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT?

12:48.135 --> 12:50.170
UH...THE BASEMENT.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.906
YOU'RE EATING
DEVILED EGGS
FROM THE BASEMENT?

12:52.940 --> 12:56.276
BUT I WOULDN'T
GO DOWN THERE.
THEY'RE NOT VERY GOOD.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.311
WHAT IS HE DOING NOW?

12:58.345 --> 13:00.047
BABY, HE'S NOT--
HE'S JUST--
COME ON.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.448
BABY, BABY, BABY,
COME ON, COME ON.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.584
HE'S HAVING A LITTLE
DEVILED EGGS THING
DOWNSTAIRS.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.487
THAT CAN'T BE A STRIKE,
CAN IT?

13:07.520 --> 13:11.224
YO...WE'RE HERE
FOR THE FUND-RAISER.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.960
UH...DOWN THE HALL,

13:12.993 --> 13:15.128
TO YOUR LEFT.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.330
STRIKE 2?

13:17.364 --> 13:19.867
OH, YEAH. MM-HMM.
ONE MORE...

13:19.900 --> 13:21.969
I KNOW. I KNOW
HOW IT GOES.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.204
HEY, JIMMY.
SISTER HELEN,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:24.237 --> 13:26.840
I JUST HAD THE WORST
DAY OF MY LIFE.

13:26.874 --> 13:27.941
THANKS, MOM.

13:27.975 --> 13:28.976
WHAT DID I DO?

13:29.009 --> 13:31.344
OH, LET'S JUST SAY
YOUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE PICNIC

13:31.378 --> 13:34.381
WAS FELT BY EVERYONE!

13:35.348 --> 13:38.218
SOMETIMES I THINK
THAT IF WE'D JUST LISTEN
TO THE HOMELESS,

13:38.251 --> 13:41.421
WE'D SEE THAT THEY
REALLY HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS.

13:42.222 --> 13:45.292
SISTER HELEN,
I THINK I'M GONNA--

13:45.325 --> 13:48.962
AAH! WATCH THE SHOES!

13:52.265 --> 13:54.167
KAREN, GET THE JANITOR!

13:54.201 --> 13:58.205
TELL HIM TO GET OUT
THE SAWDUST RESERVES!

13:58.238 --> 13:58.906
MY GOD!

13:58.939 --> 14:04.011
WHAT IS GOING ON
AROUND HERE?!

14:08.348 --> 14:09.983
KIDS, LISTEN TO ME!

14:10.017 --> 14:14.387
DO NOT EAT JIMMY FINNERTY'S
MOTHER'S MACARONI SALAD!

14:14.421 --> 14:20.027
I REPEAT--JIMMY FINNERTY'S
MOTHER'S MACARONI SALAD

14:20.060 --> 14:22.930
WILL MAKE YOU SICK!!

14:22.963 --> 14:24.965
I--I'M SO SORRY,
JIMMY.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.200
I JUST WANNA GO CHANGE
MY UNDERWEAR.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.401
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR UNDERWEAR?

14:28.435 --> 14:29.669
I--I DON'T WANNA
TALK ABOUT IT.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.373
WELL, THANKS FOR
YOUR HELP, MRS. FINNERTY.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.608
OH, AND FOR THE
CHRISTMAS POT LUCK,

14:35.642 --> 14:37.377
SHOULD I PUT YOU DOWN
FOR RAW CHICKEN

14:37.410 --> 14:41.281
OR WOULD YOU JUST LIKE TO
BRING YOUR CAR AND RUN OVER
A FEW KIDS?

14:41.314 --> 14:44.051
OK. I GET IT, SISTER.
I'LL TRY TO BE
MORE CAREFUL.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.286
BABY, YOU DO NOT
HAVE TO TAKE THAT.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.287
SEAN, IT'S OK.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.455
NO, IT IS NOT OK!

14:48.488 --> 14:51.291
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOUR DAYS ARE LIKE,
SISTER HELEN, OK,

14:51.324 --> 14:54.194
BUT MY WIFE HAS TO MANAGE
A HOUSE, RAISE KIDS,

14:54.227 --> 14:58.465
WORK A JOB, GO TO SCHOOL--
ALL WITHOUT ANY HELP
FROM ME.

14:58.498 --> 14:59.933
AND NOW SHE'S PREGNANT.

14:59.967 --> 15:01.268
SEAN, IT'S OK.
NO, IT'S NOT OK.

15:01.301 --> 15:04.404
AND SHE COOKED 30 POUNDS
OF MACARONI SALAD FOR YOU.

15:04.437 --> 15:07.340
AND SO WHAT?
WHAT DOES SHE GET?
A FEW KIDS GOT SICK.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.376
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M SICK OF?

15:09.409 --> 15:11.211
THE LACK OF APPRECIATION
FOR HER!

15:11.244 --> 15:12.345
SHE'S A WOMAN--

15:12.379 --> 15:13.680
I DIDN'T MAKE
THE MACARONI SALAD.

15:13.713 --> 15:16.483
...WHO DID NOT MAKE
THE MACARONI SALAD!

15:16.516 --> 15:18.018
WHAT?

15:18.051 --> 15:21.021
IT WAS LATE.
I WAS TIRED.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.356
PICKLES, PICKLES.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.492
PICKLES...

15:35.002 --> 15:37.037
WE'RE GONNA NEED
MORE TUBS OVER HERE!

15:37.070 --> 15:39.406
YOU BOUGHT IT
AT A GAS STATION?

15:39.439 --> 15:40.740
SLASH MINI-MART.

15:40.773 --> 15:45.512
SO YOU POISONED
THE CHILDREN WITH EVEN
LESS EFFORT THAN I THOUGHT.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.279
PRETTY MUCH.

15:46.313 --> 15:49.182
WELL,
I BETTER GET GOING.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.750
I STILL HAVE
4 OF YOUR VICTIMS

15:50.783 --> 15:54.221
DRY-HEAVING IN THE BACK
OF MY ASTROVAN.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.458
OH! HA. SISTER HELEN.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.292
LILY.

15:59.326 --> 16:00.693
I WAS TOO BUSY
MOPPING UP AT THE PICNIC

16:00.727 --> 16:05.498
TO THANK YOU FOR RUINING
OUR CHANCES OF MAKING
THE PLAYOFFS THIS YEAR.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.567
YOU'RE WELCOME.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.636
UH, LILY,

16:09.669 --> 16:12.139
WHAT'S SHE TALKING ABOUT?

16:12.172 --> 16:14.541
HA. WELL, SHE
WANTED TO THANK ME.

16:14.574 --> 16:17.410
AND SHE DID,
SO IT'S ALL GOOD.

16:17.444 --> 16:18.611
LILY, WHAT HAPPENED?

16:18.645 --> 16:25.085
BRAD'S STUPID GIRLFRIEND
GOT ME KICKED OFF
THE DANCE SQUAD.

16:28.621 --> 16:31.624
SINCE JASON'S GOING TO BE
STARTING QUARTERBACK
THIS SEASON,

16:31.658 --> 16:33.626
I DECORATED HIS CAR
WITH STREAMERS.

16:33.660 --> 16:37.497
I FILLED TAYA'S LOCKER
WITH CONFETTI.

16:38.665 --> 16:42.435
SO WHAT DO WE WEAR
TO THE GAMES, YOU KNOW?

16:48.375 --> 16:49.276
THANK YOU, DANCE SQUAD.

16:49.309 --> 16:52.112
AT THIS POINT,
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK
EVERYONE

16:52.145 --> 16:53.746
TO RAISE THE ROOF!

16:53.780 --> 16:55.815
WHOO! WHOO!

16:55.848 --> 16:58.285
COME ON, GIVE IT UP, HUH?

16:58.318 --> 16:59.119
AS WE ALL KNOW,

16:59.152 --> 17:01.521
THIS YEAR,
ST. FINNIAN'S FOOTBALL TEAM

17:01.554 --> 17:04.457
HAS A NEW SECRET WEAPON!

17:06.126 --> 17:12.665
Chanting: TAYA, TAYA, TAYA!

17:12.699 --> 17:15.835
Coach: SHE IS THE FIRST
FEMALE EVER

17:15.868 --> 17:17.604
TO DON A LION'S UNIFORM!

17:17.637 --> 17:20.073
SO GIVE IT UP FOR TAYA!

17:20.107 --> 17:24.544
MARSHALL! TAYA MARSHALL!
COME ON, TAYA!

17:33.686 --> 17:36.156
I THINK IT'S SPRAINED.

17:37.124 --> 17:40.660
WHY!

17:48.168 --> 17:49.269
YOU TRIPPED HER?

17:49.302 --> 17:51.538
WELL, WHAT WAS I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

17:51.571 --> 17:52.605
NOT TRIP HER.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.841
IF I'D THOUGHT OF
THAT, I MIGHT HAVE
GONE THAT WAY.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.743
WHAT HAPPENED TO BEING
THE BIGGER PERSON?

17:56.776 --> 17:59.846
WHY IS EVERYBODY
SO OBSESSED WITH BEING
THE BIGGER PERSON?

17:59.879 --> 18:01.614
WHAT'S WRONG WITH BEING
THE SMALLER PERSON?

18:01.648 --> 18:05.218
DOESN'T ANYBODY ROOT
FOR THE UNDERDOG
ANYMORE?

18:07.220 --> 18:09.356
THIS IS SO MY FAULT.

18:09.389 --> 18:10.557
HOW? HOW IS THIS
YOUR FAULT?

18:10.590 --> 18:13.526
LILY CAME TO ME
FOR ADVICE YESTERDAY,
AND I HALF-ASSED IT

18:13.560 --> 18:17.264
BECAUSE I WAS TOO BUSY
HALF-ASSING JIMMY'S
MACARONI SALAD.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.431
HEY, HEY.
LILY IS INSANE, OK?

18:18.465 --> 18:20.400
SO IT WOULDN'T MAKE
ANY DIFFERENCE
IF YOU FULL-ASSED IT.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.869
THE WHOLE JIMMY'S STUFF,
MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE
PREVENTED THAT,

18:22.902 --> 18:26.506
BUT YOU WERE
WORKING SO HARD.
YOU WERE TRYING.

18:26.539 --> 18:27.574
THEN I HAVE TO TRY
HARDER.

18:27.607 --> 18:31.378
NO, YOU HAVE TO TRY LESS.
YOU'RE 3 MONTHS PREGNANT.

18:31.411 --> 18:32.379
THAT'S WHY
I HAVE TO TRY HARDER,

18:32.412 --> 18:34.647
BECAUSE I HAVE TO DO
ALL THE THINGS
I USED TO DO

18:34.681 --> 18:35.582
PLUS GET READY
FOR THE BABY.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.784
NO, YOU GOTTA REST
AND TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF

18:37.817 --> 18:39.586
AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME
WHILE I'M STILL USEFUL,

18:39.619 --> 18:43.556
BECAUSE ONCE THE BABY
COMES, I'M...
PRETTY MUCH USELESS.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.525
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

18:45.558 --> 18:46.559
BABY, DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

18:46.593 --> 18:49.162
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT,
THE BABY WAKES UP...

18:49.196 --> 18:50.663
YOU KNOW,
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

18:50.697 --> 18:53.566
I CAN'T FEED HIM.
I DON'T HAVE THE NECESSARY--
YOU KNOW.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.936
SO YOU GET UP
AND YOU CHANGE HIS DIAPER
AND ROCK HIM TO SLEEP--

18:56.969 --> 18:59.706
YEAH, AND 2 HOURS LATER
WHEN HE CRIES AGAIN,

18:59.739 --> 19:01.174
YOU PRETEND
TO BE ASLEEP,

19:01.208 --> 19:03.543
AND I GET UP AGAIN
AND FEED HIM AGAIN.

19:03.576 --> 19:04.244
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.679
WHY ARE WE CALLING HIM
A "HE"?

19:06.713 --> 19:09.282
IT MIGHT BE A GIRL.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.351
WE COULD HAVE
ANOTHER LILY.

19:11.384 --> 19:14.654
OH, GOD. YOU'D BETTER
GO GET SOME SLEEP.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.825
I'M JUST GONNA
GO CLEAN THIS BOWL--

19:18.858 --> 19:20.260
NO, NO. I GOT IT.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.294
IT'S DISGUSTING--

19:21.328 --> 19:22.895
I KNOW.
YOU GO TO BED.

19:22.929 --> 19:23.796
THANKS, BABE.

19:23.830 --> 19:27.234
BABY, I GOT IT, OK?
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME.

19:27.267 --> 19:31.571
MOMMY GO TO SLEEP
AND DADDY CLEAN.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.614
HEY, UNCLE EDDIE.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.483
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

19:43.516 --> 19:46.519
I THINK IT'S FINALLY OVER
BETWEEN ME AND BRAD.

19:46.553 --> 19:50.657
HE'S TOTALLY IN LOVE
WITH HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND.

19:52.292 --> 19:55.728
BUT IN 20 YEARS,
YOU WON'T EVEN REMEMBER
ANY OF THIS.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.464
OH, YES, I WILL.

19:57.497 --> 20:00.800
THERE WAS THIS GIRL
I DATED IN HIGH SCHOOL...

20:00.833 --> 20:03.503
JEN FULCHER.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.606
SHE TOTALLY
BROKE MY HEART.

20:06.873 --> 20:11.744
SHE CHEATED ON ME
WITH 2 OF MY BEST FRIENDS...

20:11.778 --> 20:13.746
AT THE SAME TIME.

20:14.847 --> 20:18.385
ACTUALLY,
IT WAS KINDA HOT.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.688
BUT IT HURT LIKE HELL.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.756
YOU NEVER THINK
ABOUT HER ANYMORE?

20:23.790 --> 20:26.293
YEAH, OBVIOUSLY,
I STILL THINK ABOUT HER.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.560
I JUST TOLD THE STORY,
BUT...

20:27.594 --> 20:29.529
BUT EVERY DAY I THINK
ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT LESS,

20:29.562 --> 20:32.465
AND THAT'S WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN
WITH YOU AND BRAD.

20:32.499 --> 20:33.366
REALLY?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.302
THERE ARE TONS OF PEOPLE
OUT THERE FOR YOU.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.970
JUST DON'T BE LIKE
JEN FULCHER.
TAKE 'EM ONE AT A TIME.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.639
THANK YOU, UNCLE EDDIE.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.709
OH, MY GOD, DID I
LEAVE THAT DOOR OPEN
THE WHOLE TIME?

20:42.742 --> 20:43.776
I DON'T KNOW. WHY?

20:43.810 --> 20:45.278
I DON'T WANT BRUNO
TO GET OUT.

20:45.312 --> 20:46.513
WHO'S BRUNO?

20:46.546 --> 20:48.648
Claudia: SNAAAAAAAKE!

20:48.681 --> 20:49.716
SEE YA.

20:49.749 --> 20:53.553
Claudia: STRIKE 3!!
