WEBVTT

00:29.447 --> 00:31.114
Do you guys smell that?

00:31.115 --> 00:34.034
What?
What's wrong?

00:34.035 --> 00:35.786
Something bad happened.

00:41.959 --> 00:43.668
Oh, God...

00:43.669 --> 00:44.712
Run!

00:45.004 --> 00:46.005
Run!

00:47.089 --> 00:48.757
Rimmer!

00:52.553 --> 00:53.720
Run!

00:55.306 --> 00:57.265
- Estevez!
- Shit!

00:57.266 --> 00:59.184
Farah Black?

00:59.185 --> 01:01.019
You're with them now?
Drop your weapon.

01:01.020 --> 01:03.605
They're the ones you want.
I am on your side--

01:03.606 --> 01:04.689
There are no sides!

01:04.690 --> 01:06.858
- Drop the gun now!
- You are making a mistake--

01:06.859 --> 01:08.526
You're pointing your weapon
at a police officer--

01:08.527 --> 01:10.111
- Just listen to what I'm telling you--
- Drop it!

01:10.112 --> 01:12.197
- Five, four, three--
- To what I am--

01:12.198 --> 01:13.908
- Two!
- Okay.

01:17.661 --> 01:18.662
Okay.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.801
All right...

01:32.802 --> 01:34.469
I solved the mystery...

01:34.470 --> 01:36.763
Don't talk.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.765
Put some pressure right...

01:38.766 --> 01:41.351
right here.

01:41.352 --> 01:43.104
Oh, God... Todd?

01:44.188 --> 01:47.524
They're gone now.

01:47.525 --> 01:49.276
We're going to be okay now.

01:50.069 --> 01:51.195
You sure about that?

02:10.131 --> 02:11.589
It's tough to be a princess,

02:11.590 --> 02:13.092
but I like a challenge.

02:14.844 --> 02:18.347
<i>How can you tell what love feels like
when everybody loves you?</i>

02:20.391 --> 02:24.270
<i>Sometimes, I feel like I'm walking
in someone else's dreams...</i>

02:25.938 --> 02:27.438
<i>Everything is connected...</i>

02:27.439 --> 02:29.149
Hey, Bart, I got clothes.

02:29.150 --> 02:30.942
This was all I could find.

02:30.943 --> 02:32.735
I stole it from downstairs, so...

02:32.736 --> 02:34.696
<i>Aren't we lucky that we live
in such a beautiful world?</i>

02:34.697 --> 02:35.989
Bart?

02:35.990 --> 02:37.740
Why are you in such a hurry?

02:37.741 --> 02:41.494
Well, we've... got places to go.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.580
Right?

02:43.497 --> 02:44.747
<i>Everything is connected...</i>

02:44.748 --> 02:46.749
Maybe we could just stay here

02:46.750 --> 02:48.710
and watch the TV.

02:48.711 --> 02:50.670
They got these shows
in between shows

02:50.671 --> 02:52.797
that show you things
you can buy in a store.

02:52.798 --> 02:53.673
Commercials?

02:53.674 --> 02:54.883
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:54.884 --> 02:56.843
They're terrific.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.012
Okay.

02:58.304 --> 03:00.054
<i>It's like you wake up one morning...</i>

03:00.055 --> 03:01.472
Commercials it is.

03:01.473 --> 03:04.726
<i>...Your parents hate you
and your brother's gay.</i>

03:04.727 --> 03:06.686
Everything is connected.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.188
<i>If you can't be a princes...</i>

03:08.189 --> 03:10.232
I never had a surprise before.

03:12.985 --> 03:16.196
I only got two bullets left.

03:16.197 --> 03:18.032
<i>I still hurt all over.</i>

03:20.075 --> 03:22.577
- Maybe--
<i>- Bart.</i>

03:22.578 --> 03:24.871
Two bullets?

03:24.872 --> 03:26.164
Seriously?

03:26.165 --> 03:28.166
That's your excuse?

03:28.167 --> 03:30.835
I saw you kill someone
by waving at them.

03:30.836 --> 03:34.256
All that stuff you said to me
about life and purpose and stuff?

03:36.133 --> 03:38.718
You think maybe...

03:38.719 --> 03:42.639
surprises are good sometimes?

03:42.640 --> 03:45.643
Like there could be such thing
as a surprise that helps you?

03:47.853 --> 03:49.520
Yes.

03:49.521 --> 03:50.648
I do.

03:52.191 --> 03:53.107
Yeah.

03:53.108 --> 03:55.693
What doesn't kill you,
you know, usually makes you--

03:55.694 --> 03:58.113
Makes you hurt real bad
and makes you cry.

03:59.949 --> 04:02.659
Makes you stronger.

04:02.660 --> 04:03.952
That's....

04:03.953 --> 04:05.828
Yeah.

04:13.462 --> 04:16.464
I think you're right, Ken.

04:16.465 --> 04:18.717
I think I wanna see
where those two bullets go.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.094
Okay.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.762
You know, I'll bet

04:22.763 --> 04:26.683
that if you head out that door
and start walking,

04:26.684 --> 04:27.893
you'll find out.

04:49.581 --> 04:51.041
You saved me.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.711
Don't rub it in.

04:54.712 --> 04:57.588
How are we going
to get out of this one, right?

04:57.589 --> 05:00.174
Just another crazy...

05:00.175 --> 05:02.052
situation.

05:07.016 --> 05:08.225
Farah...

05:08.892 --> 05:13.771
The night you were kidnapped...

05:13.772 --> 05:16.608
It was me behind the door
you were knocking on.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.819
I didn't let you in, and--

05:19.820 --> 05:22.072
I know that. Obviously.

05:23.115 --> 05:23.990
You knew?

05:23.991 --> 05:27.869
It's not like I forgot
which door I knocked on, Todd.

05:27.870 --> 05:31.331
It's my fault,
I had my weapon drawn.

05:31.332 --> 05:32.540
Well, right, but--

05:32.541 --> 05:35.084
When I met you
that first night, you...

05:35.085 --> 05:36.377
<i>you saved my life.</i>

05:36.378 --> 05:38.629
By the time I realized
that was your door,

05:38.630 --> 05:41.215
I knew you well enough
to understand why that door

05:41.216 --> 05:43.051
did not open that night.

05:43.052 --> 05:45.428
- It was my fault.
- I...

05:45.429 --> 05:47.680
should never been there
in the first place.

05:47.681 --> 05:51.017
Ah. See?

05:51.018 --> 05:54.479
You also knew...

05:54.480 --> 05:55.647
a thing.

05:57.900 --> 06:01.361
I didn't lie to you
any more than you lied to Farah.

06:01.362 --> 06:02.654
Yes, you did.

06:03.822 --> 06:07.325
I would describe it as...

06:07.326 --> 06:10.120
"strategic no-truthing."

06:12.956 --> 06:14.624
<i>Go on, go!</i>

06:14.625 --> 06:17.210
<i>Go.</i>

06:18.754 --> 06:19.922
Go.

06:21.757 --> 06:24.550
Stop. Stop!

06:24.551 --> 06:26.302
All right, calm down, Lydia,

06:26.303 --> 06:27.804
<i>it's gonna be all right,
we're gonna figure this out.</i>

06:27.805 --> 06:30.181
It's gonna be all right...

06:30.182 --> 06:31.307
Maybe.

06:32.476 --> 06:33.976
The corgi knows.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.269
Or rather,

06:35.270 --> 06:36.938
Lydia Spring knows.

06:36.939 --> 06:38.940
I'm sorry, Ms. Spring,

06:38.941 --> 06:42.527
it was destroyed after
this nice "real" detective

06:42.528 --> 06:46.364
- shot it a bazillion times.
- You shut up!

06:46.365 --> 06:49.283
All right?

06:49.284 --> 06:51.285
I need to focus.
I need to...

06:51.286 --> 06:52.829
I've gotta figure this out.

06:52.830 --> 06:54.163
<i>All right?
What is this place?</i>

06:54.164 --> 06:55.374
Who are you people?

06:56.500 --> 06:59.085
How the hell did you do this to her?

06:59.086 --> 07:01.087
I want answers.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.172
Talk!

07:02.214 --> 07:04.590
Okay, so,

07:04.591 --> 07:06.050
100 years ago--

07:06.051 --> 07:08.010
All right, I'm gonna need you
to shut up with that shit right now--

07:08.011 --> 07:08.886
I thought you said
you wanted answers--

07:08.887 --> 07:10.513
I want reality!

07:10.514 --> 07:12.098
I want my reality back,

07:12.099 --> 07:13.851
and I want it back
right goddamn now--

07:17.187 --> 07:18.730
I am not the enemy.

07:24.820 --> 07:27.281
I-I just want to know
what's going on.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.702
<i>Please, will somebody
tell me what's going on?</i>

07:32.703 --> 07:35.164
Huh? Please.

07:46.175 --> 07:47.925
More than a hundred years ago,

07:47.926 --> 07:49.552
a man named Zackariah Webb

07:49.553 --> 07:52.221
built a machine that broke
and went to the future,

07:52.222 --> 07:56.142
where these tattooed wackos found it,
and used it to swap souls.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.561
<i>They swapped Lydia with a corgi</i>

07:58.562 --> 08:00.897
<i>to use as leverage
to stop Patrick Spring,</i>

08:00.898 --> 08:03.065
who was actually
also Zackariah Webb,

08:03.066 --> 08:05.359
having jumped through time
to get his machine back--

08:05.360 --> 08:07.195
I hate everything
about this right now...

08:07.196 --> 08:08.446
<i>In 2002,</i>

08:08.447 --> 08:10.823
after the Men of the Machine
killed his wife,

08:10.824 --> 08:12.742
Patrick Spring,
who was a fake identity,

08:12.743 --> 08:15.077
created to be
the son of Edgar Spring,

08:15.078 --> 08:17.663
who was actually Zackariah Webb,

08:17.664 --> 08:19.874
<i>jumped forward in time
to last week,</i>

08:19.875 --> 08:21.667
<i>destroyed the Men Of the Machine,</i>

08:21.668 --> 08:24.921
and then went to the Perryman Grand
to confront his future self,

08:24.922 --> 08:27.381
which led to the young Patrick Spring

08:27.382 --> 08:29.592
accidentally killing old Patrick Spring,

08:29.593 --> 08:32.471
when a kitten went off
and set off a shark explosion.

08:36.308 --> 08:38.976
Wait, so, that's what happened?

08:38.977 --> 08:41.938
Fairly straightforward, I think.

08:41.939 --> 08:42.897
Estevez...

08:42.898 --> 08:45.608
there's still a way to save Lydia.

08:45.609 --> 08:48.027
That's right.

08:48.028 --> 08:51.489
You destroyed this machine,
and this plug,

08:51.490 --> 08:53.741
but there's another way.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.576
How?

08:55.577 --> 08:56.953
That thing.

08:56.954 --> 08:59.872
<i>It's another version
of the same machine,</i>

08:59.873 --> 09:01.541
and we know where to plug it in.

09:03.669 --> 09:06.420
<i>Sir?</i>

09:06.421 --> 09:08.381
<i>Sir, you can't
come in here like that!</i>

09:08.382 --> 09:09.966
Shut up, idiot.
I'm talking to the captain.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.968
- Hey!
- Boys...

09:11.969 --> 09:13.554
- Get in there.
- Stand down.

09:15.764 --> 09:16.597
You can't just come in--

09:16.598 --> 09:18.766
They stole the soul-exchanger.

09:18.767 --> 09:21.769
And you know who has it?

09:21.770 --> 09:24.272
Your man, Estevez.

09:24.273 --> 09:27.233
So...

09:27.234 --> 09:30.987
it's finally over.

09:30.988 --> 09:33.739
You've got no friends left, Rimmer.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.449
I've been making calls

09:35.450 --> 09:37.660
to Brothers in high places all day.

09:37.661 --> 09:38.953
Nobody's picking up.

09:38.954 --> 09:41.789
There's no one left to help you.

09:41.790 --> 09:45.042
Coming here,
you've put me in danger.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.587
The Men of the Machine are over,
you've destroyed us!

09:47.588 --> 09:48.921
No, no, no...

09:48.922 --> 09:52.675
They're going to try and switch
Lydia and Rapunzel back.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.135
We get that machine back,

09:54.136 --> 09:55.636
we get control.

09:55.637 --> 09:59.015
We are gonna go
to the only altar that's left.

09:59.016 --> 10:01.225
We're gonna take men,
we're gonna take weapons,

10:01.226 --> 10:03.102
and we're gonna go there.

10:03.103 --> 10:06.105
If we quit now,
then we lose everything.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.150
But no.

10:09.151 --> 10:10.527
We go there.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.039
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

10:23.040 --> 10:24.915
I got you, I got you.

10:24.916 --> 10:26.417
Thank you. Thank you, I...

10:26.418 --> 10:29.879
I feel less walkie
and more fall-y right now.

10:29.880 --> 10:30.921
Don't mention it.

10:30.922 --> 10:33.424
You gonna stay with us?

10:33.425 --> 10:35.635
What, you mean like,
with the living people?

10:35.636 --> 10:36.469
Yeah.

10:36.470 --> 10:39.347
Ideally, yes,
but you know how things are

10:39.348 --> 10:42.224
when you've got the cereal bowl
flower exchange...

10:42.225 --> 10:43.310
Say what?

10:44.186 --> 10:46.395
There's a lot of wording happening

10:46.396 --> 10:48.856
should me no talk good
'cause blood all gone.

10:48.857 --> 10:49.815
Right...

10:49.816 --> 10:51.108
Arrow have.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.943
I see that...

10:52.944 --> 10:55.446
Todd, are you good?

10:55.447 --> 10:58.908
The answer to that question
is kind of long.

10:58.909 --> 11:00.201
Let's go.

11:00.202 --> 11:02.037
Come on, I'll put you down.
There we go.

11:03.246 --> 11:06.207
There are six entrances to the house.

11:06.208 --> 11:09.585
There's no way we can cover all of them,
so if anyone comes in--

11:09.586 --> 11:10.795
Wait...

11:10.796 --> 11:12.088
would they come here?

11:12.089 --> 11:16.008
This... thing, it's like their most sacred...

11:16.009 --> 11:17.259
thing.

11:17.260 --> 11:18.928
They're gonna be mad we took it.

11:18.929 --> 11:21.598
So they know what's under this place.

11:23.058 --> 11:24.433
What is under this place?

11:24.434 --> 11:27.561
A place with the...

11:29.189 --> 11:30.482
stuff.

11:33.694 --> 11:35.194
Oh, shit.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.279
Ms. Black...

11:37.280 --> 11:38.615
How much of this is legal?

11:39.574 --> 11:42.326
There are a number of loopholes,
you know, legally,

11:42.327 --> 11:44.120
regarding what constitutes a militia,

11:44.121 --> 11:46.580
with relevance to state law,
and in accordance with---

11:46.581 --> 11:48.833
You know what, never mind.

11:48.834 --> 11:50.794
This is the least illegal shit I've done all day.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.296
If this is a time machine,
can I go back?

11:54.297 --> 11:56.716
Go back? Where?

11:56.717 --> 11:57.591
Save my partner.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.219
Some things can't be changed.

12:04.599 --> 12:05.766
Lydia first.

12:05.767 --> 12:06.810
Whoa!

12:13.900 --> 12:15.860
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

12:15.861 --> 12:18.320
No. I only saw them do this once.

12:19.865 --> 12:21.949
We jump them,
and they switch places.

12:21.950 --> 12:24.452
Make thing switchy.

12:24.453 --> 12:25.578
Sw...switch...

12:25.579 --> 12:28.165
The Men of the Machine
had a whole contraption for this.

12:38.717 --> 12:40.426
Is it supposed to do that?

12:40.427 --> 12:42.553
I'm not qualified to answer that question.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.013
<i>Why can't I go back?</i>

12:44.014 --> 12:46.515
It's already on. I could go back,
I could-I could fix this.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.768
- I could fix everything--
- Bring Lydia here.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.311
Why are we even bothering with this?

12:50.312 --> 12:52.062
I could go back and stop her
from ever being kidnapped.

12:52.063 --> 12:54.523
Because it doesn't work that way--
Because it doesn't--

12:54.524 --> 12:55.649
Todd!

12:55.650 --> 12:56.692
No, don't worry about me.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.528
We're too close to give up now.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.115
Hold her there.

13:09.664 --> 13:11.958
Okay, Estevez, push that crank.

13:35.649 --> 13:36.817
Yeah!

13:44.866 --> 13:45.992
What the hell is that?

13:49.913 --> 13:50.913
Hey!

13:50.914 --> 13:52.581
No, no, trust me,
you have to trust me--

13:52.582 --> 13:54.291
- No, you killed her!
- Switch them! Switch them now!

13:54.292 --> 13:55.418
I got her, I got her.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.629
She's dead, man.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.130
- It's how you do it.
- She's not breathing.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.258
- You frigging killed them.
- Is this what should happen?

14:02.259 --> 14:03.592
It's gonna work.

14:03.593 --> 14:04.885
<i>Three...</i>

14:04.886 --> 14:06.095
two...

14:06.096 --> 14:07.805
one.

14:12.060 --> 14:15.020
Hey, hey, come on, Lydia.

14:16.314 --> 14:17.982
Whoo!

14:28.577 --> 14:29.870
Screw this.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.664
She bit me!

14:34.082 --> 14:35.166
Come on...

14:43.258 --> 14:44.467
Hey...

14:49.431 --> 14:51.557
Farah?

14:51.558 --> 14:53.350
Lydia?

14:53.351 --> 14:54.727
Oh, my God!

14:57.063 --> 14:59.148
Oh, my God!

14:59.149 --> 15:00.733
It worked.

15:00.734 --> 15:01.901
Holy shit.

15:01.902 --> 15:03.569
I thought we would never get you back.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.820
I'm so stupid.

15:04.821 --> 15:07.114
I should've never gone
to that guy's house, but...

15:07.115 --> 15:08.533
I knew you could do it.

15:09.326 --> 15:11.118
The moment I saw you,

15:11.119 --> 15:13.246
I knew everything
was going to be all right.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.956
Okay.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.541
Okay...

15:22.005 --> 15:23.422
Thank you so much.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.717
We did the best we could for you, Lydia.

15:31.014 --> 15:33.224
These guys threw me off a bridge.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.312
I'll help you up.
Come on.

15:39.147 --> 15:41.065
Look at me?

15:45.153 --> 15:46.320
We got company.

15:46.321 --> 15:47.696
Wait, Farah!

15:47.697 --> 15:48.614
<i>Where are you going?</i>

15:48.615 --> 15:50.199
Stay here.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.077
- Farah, wait...
- Stay here!

15:56.998 --> 15:58.165
Whoa! Jesus!

16:14.349 --> 16:16.475
We have to fix the machine.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.810
We have to send it back.

16:17.811 --> 16:18.978
Send it back?

16:18.979 --> 16:20.729
We should destroy this stupid thing!

16:20.730 --> 16:22.064
No.

16:22.065 --> 16:23.107
It won't work.

16:23.108 --> 16:25.275
It needs this.

16:25.276 --> 16:26.652
It needs to go back
to where it came from,

16:26.653 --> 16:28.153
to start the loop again.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.698
<i>They put me in a dog.</i>

16:30.699 --> 16:33.575
I watched him feed me dog food.

16:33.576 --> 16:37.204
I have been sleeping
on the streets for a week,

16:37.205 --> 16:39.623
I was so hungry, I ate a rat.

16:39.624 --> 16:44.336
If we don't send
the Machine back in time...

16:44.337 --> 16:46.380
you won't exist.

16:46.381 --> 16:48.173
<i>You're the center of the loop.</i>

16:48.174 --> 16:50.801
It all revolves around you.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.803
This has to go back to your dad,

16:52.804 --> 16:55.389
so that he can try
and manipulate the future,

16:55.390 --> 16:59.977
and eventually meet your mom, and...

16:59.978 --> 17:01.103
...sex with her, and--

17:01.104 --> 17:02.021
Todd, Todd, Todd, Todd...

17:02.022 --> 17:03.147
Everything's spinning.

17:03.148 --> 17:04.398
Yeah, but still.

17:04.399 --> 17:05.858
You guys are both dying.

17:05.859 --> 17:06.734
<i>No.</i>

17:06.735 --> 17:08.569
We're not.

17:08.570 --> 17:09.738
We're okay--

17:11.114 --> 17:12.072
Todd...

17:12.073 --> 17:13.282
We have to get out of here.

17:13.283 --> 17:17.536
- Someone has to tell Farah we--
- Lydia...

17:17.537 --> 17:21.915
Your dad did all of this to save you.

17:21.916 --> 17:23.876
He died

17:23.877 --> 17:25.503
to save your life.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.056
Okay.

17:37.140 --> 17:38.600
What do I do?

17:46.441 --> 17:47.776
Cover me!

17:54.032 --> 17:55.200
Shit.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.702
What do I do now?

17:58.703 --> 18:01.497
How do I, like,
turn it on or whatever?

18:01.498 --> 18:02.832
Turn the crank.

18:06.127 --> 18:07.628
Wait.

18:07.629 --> 18:08.629
<i>Wait.</i>

18:08.630 --> 18:10.339
The machine's still broken.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.007
Oh, shit.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.008
You're right.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.260
Okay...

18:22.227 --> 18:23.311
Okay...

18:24.270 --> 18:26.439
Okay, maybe if I can just...

18:31.152 --> 18:32.821
No!

18:34.572 --> 18:35.657
Really?

18:45.750 --> 18:47.335
Stop right now!

18:48.169 --> 18:49.002
<i>I swear to God,</i>

18:49.003 --> 18:52.090
I'll smash this stupid thing
into a billion pieces!

18:56.886 --> 18:57.928
Cover!

19:03.977 --> 19:05.186
Cover me!

19:06.479 --> 19:07.312
Move it!

19:15.947 --> 19:17.573
<i>I'll do it.</i>

19:17.574 --> 19:21.368
- I'll--
- You'll smash it?

19:21.369 --> 19:22.828
And then what?

19:22.829 --> 19:25.290
What then, Lydia Spring?
What then?

19:28.710 --> 19:29.794
Who's that, Ed?

19:31.754 --> 19:33.298
Yo.

19:36.217 --> 19:37.969
But--

19:44.809 --> 19:46.561
Uh...

19:49.689 --> 19:51.231
I'm sorry about earlier.

19:51.232 --> 19:53.317
- I'll do it right this time.
- No, no, no, no!

19:53.318 --> 19:54.402
Bart?

19:55.653 --> 19:56.945
This is it.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.280
<i>These bald guys,</i>

19:58.281 --> 20:00.073
these are the guys that hired me,

20:00.074 --> 20:02.492
the day you found me?

20:02.493 --> 20:03.703
And this thing...

20:05.079 --> 20:07.332
This is the thing
that they hired me to build.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.678
Can you fix this?

20:21.679 --> 20:23.097
Yes.

20:26.434 --> 20:27.894
It's my destiny.

20:38.238 --> 20:39.489
Where is my gun?

20:42.367 --> 20:44.076
Hey, Rapunzel...

20:44.077 --> 20:45.578
Hi. Hi!

20:51.584 --> 20:53.752
Give me my dog.

20:57.966 --> 20:59.175
Drop your gun.

21:00.051 --> 21:02.595
I'm going to shoot you in the head.

21:04.222 --> 21:07.015
I am gonna shoot you in the head,

21:07.016 --> 21:09.977
and take my goddamn dog!

21:09.978 --> 21:11.479
One of those things is gonna happen.

21:34.502 --> 21:35.878
I think I did it.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.424
I think I finished it.

21:41.426 --> 21:44.928
Bart, this is why
you brought me here.

21:44.929 --> 21:46.556
I still got one bullet left.

22:03.364 --> 22:04.865
Huh.

22:04.866 --> 22:06.242
Weird.

22:21.299 --> 22:22.425
Okay.

22:25.345 --> 22:26.803
Bye, Dirk.

22:28.723 --> 22:30.640
Let's get outta here,
these people are nutjobs.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.268
Mm-hmm.

22:56.584 --> 22:57.627
Okay.

22:58.795 --> 23:00.046
On three.

23:00.838 --> 23:02.381
One...

23:02.382 --> 23:04.758
Two...

23:04.759 --> 23:05.843
Three.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.572
Solved it.

23:34.497 --> 23:37.165
Hey, loser.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.421
Amanda?

23:42.422 --> 23:43.922
You came back?

23:43.923 --> 23:46.550
Me and the Rowdy 3
came and saved you.

23:46.551 --> 23:47.968
They say that's the last time, by the way.

23:47.969 --> 23:50.929
- Saved me?
- Yeah, duh.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.848
Saved everyone.

23:52.849 --> 23:54.391
There were, like,
a hundred dudes out there,

23:54.392 --> 23:56.435
and we beat them up,
and then they ran away.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.770
Dude, it was sick.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.188
Where's Dirk?

24:00.189 --> 24:03.150
The cop took him to the hospital.

24:03.151 --> 24:05.026
It was not pretty.

24:05.027 --> 24:07.654
Farah took Lydia... somewhere.

24:07.655 --> 24:09.449
She said to meet her
at this address at 6:00.

24:12.869 --> 24:14.786
Dirk says you hate him now?

24:14.787 --> 24:17.330
'Cause he...
tricked you or something?

24:17.331 --> 24:19.875
- He ruined my life.
- Right.

24:19.876 --> 24:21.626
All right.

24:21.627 --> 24:22.962
Later, Todd.

24:24.297 --> 24:25.797
Wait...

24:25.798 --> 24:27.340
What?

24:27.341 --> 24:30.051
You have another lottery ticket?

24:30.052 --> 24:31.846
What was your plan with that, anyway?

24:34.515 --> 24:37.100
I was gonna try and...

24:37.101 --> 24:39.102
fix things.

24:39.103 --> 24:40.605
Fix everything.

24:42.023 --> 24:44.900
Well, some things you don't fix, Todd.

24:44.901 --> 24:47.235
<i>Sometimes when you fall down,</i>

24:47.236 --> 24:48.863
you fall all the way down.

24:50.698 --> 24:52.532
<i>You blew it.</i>

24:52.533 --> 24:54.160
That's just the way it is.

25:00.416 --> 25:03.376
Here's what I do believe,

25:03.377 --> 25:07.005
I think Dirk Gently came
into your life for a reason.

25:07.006 --> 25:11.843
<i>I mean, two weeks ago,
you were a 33-year-old hotel bellhop</i>

25:11.844 --> 25:13.929
<i>with no money, and no friends,</i>

25:13.930 --> 25:17.141
who spent all of his time lying to me.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.392
<i>Now look at you.</i>

25:19.393 --> 25:21.144
You're the bad-ass partner

25:21.145 --> 25:24.231
to a psychic detective.

25:24.232 --> 25:25.650
And you're honest.

25:27.235 --> 25:30.028
<i>Think about why Dirk lied to you.</i>

25:30.029 --> 25:32.864
You and Dirk, you saved that girl.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.575
You saved that girl's life.

25:35.576 --> 25:39.037
No matter what he lied about,

25:39.038 --> 25:40.540
isn't that the part that matters?

25:43.167 --> 25:44.710
I'll see you around, Todd.

25:46.128 --> 25:48.213
Amanda...

25:48.214 --> 25:51.259
Are you really gonna...
leave with those guys?

25:52.343 --> 25:55.887
I mean, Todd, come on...

25:55.888 --> 25:57.682
they already gave me a jacket.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.275
<i>You hungry?</i>

26:08.276 --> 26:10.151
What is it?

26:10.152 --> 26:11.945
Ethiopian.

26:11.946 --> 26:13.738
That's not a word.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.073
Is that a word?

26:18.661 --> 26:20.620
You did a thing back there.

26:20.621 --> 26:22.581
With the thing?

26:22.582 --> 26:24.749
Yes, I did.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.168
You did, too.

26:27.670 --> 26:31.131
Hey, that guy, um, Dirk Gently...

26:31.132 --> 26:34.009
you weren't supposed to kill him.

26:34.010 --> 26:35.719
You were supposed to protect him.

26:35.720 --> 26:39.180
It's not the first
that's happened, is it?

26:39.181 --> 26:42.100
I was supposed
to bring you there, too, so...

26:42.101 --> 26:43.810
and you did the thing,

26:43.811 --> 26:46.147
and now that you did it,
maybe you're gonna leave, and...

26:47.565 --> 26:50.066
Like...

26:50.067 --> 26:52.777
you did your destiny or whatever,

26:52.778 --> 26:57.157
and now that you did it,
maybe you're gonna go...

26:57.158 --> 26:59.785
And it's bad, Ken--

27:04.415 --> 27:10.128
Or you do whatever you want, you know,
because I kidnapped you, and...

27:10.129 --> 27:13.465
and it must have been
really bad for you.

27:13.466 --> 27:16.594
You know, I didn't think about
your feelings and all that, and...

27:25.436 --> 27:29.064
I don't want you to go, I...

27:29.065 --> 27:30.191
I think.

27:31.901 --> 27:33.569
Hey, um...

27:36.697 --> 27:38.240
I'm not going anywhere.

27:44.246 --> 27:45.538
Okay...

27:52.421 --> 27:55.256
Security will meet you
on the ground in Belize.

27:55.257 --> 27:57.133
You cannot call me when you land.

27:57.134 --> 27:58.843
From there, you'll be on your own.

27:58.844 --> 28:01.346
Now, you can access
your father's offshore accounts--

28:01.347 --> 28:03.973
I don't understand
why I have to leave the country.

28:03.974 --> 28:05.975
It's just for now.

28:05.976 --> 28:08.478
We don't know how many of them
are still out there.

28:08.479 --> 28:10.271
They could still be looking for you.

28:10.272 --> 28:11.690
I don't even know who "they" are--

28:11.691 --> 28:13.233
They're a cult formed
around the time machine

28:13.234 --> 28:15.318
my father accidentally
sent forward from the past

28:15.319 --> 28:18.029
that use a broken aspect
of the machine to swap bodies.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.906
The guy who kidnapped me
was a rock star,

28:19.907 --> 28:21.533
and he got mad and betrayed them.

28:21.534 --> 28:24.411
Coincidentally, on the same day
my father traveled into the future

28:24.412 --> 28:26.163
to get revenge
for the murder of my mother.

28:27.957 --> 28:32.502
I am so sorry things ended this way. I...

28:32.503 --> 28:34.504
I let you down,
I let your father down--

28:34.505 --> 28:36.172
What are you talking about?

28:36.173 --> 28:39.092
It was a time loop,
there was nothing you could do.

28:39.093 --> 28:41.136
This was the best possible ending.

28:42.138 --> 28:43.722
Don't you see that?

28:43.723 --> 28:47.225
Farah, you kicked everyone's ass
and saved me.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.060
It was so...

28:49.061 --> 28:50.603
you.

28:51.939 --> 28:53.440
It was?

28:53.441 --> 28:54.441
Yeah.

28:54.442 --> 28:55.692
Ever since I was little,

28:55.693 --> 28:59.028
you were the most
inspiring person ever,

28:59.029 --> 29:01.740
but you always try to hide
from what a freak you are.

29:01.741 --> 29:03.491
- Um--
- And then when my dad died,

29:03.492 --> 29:06.661
and I was a dog,
and everything was hopeless,

29:06.662 --> 29:10.790
there you are with an army of weirdos,
saving the day.

29:10.791 --> 29:12.584
It was perfect.

29:12.585 --> 29:14.128
You are perfect.

29:23.596 --> 29:25.054
Good luck, Farah.

29:25.055 --> 29:26.222
I love you.

29:26.223 --> 29:27.892
I love you, too.

29:29.226 --> 29:31.895
I just gave you four million dollars.

29:31.896 --> 29:33.563
How?

29:33.564 --> 29:35.815
My phone. Duh.

29:35.816 --> 29:38.527
Have fun with your new friends.
They seem insane.

29:39.570 --> 29:41.071
Okay.

29:46.619 --> 29:49.412
In the beginning, it was just an idea.

29:49.413 --> 29:52.290
I wanted...

29:54.460 --> 29:59.172
I wanted so badly to believe
that there was something bigger.

29:59.173 --> 30:00.423
<i>A bigger pattern.</i>

30:00.424 --> 30:02.426
<i>A bigger... meaning.</i>

30:03.511 --> 30:05.345
I knew...

30:05.346 --> 30:07.680
when I first met you,

30:07.681 --> 30:09.349
I'd found it.

30:09.350 --> 30:16.064
It was real.
It was all real, and you were proof.

30:16.065 --> 30:19.275
<i>You are what you say you are,</i>

30:19.276 --> 30:20.986
and I am so proud of you.

30:37.753 --> 30:39.087
Very long story short,

30:39.088 --> 30:41.756
until yesterday,
it hailed as my greatest case,

30:41.757 --> 30:45.093
one of deception,
danger, double-crosses,

30:45.094 --> 30:46.970
and an all-round
perversion of high emotion,

30:46.971 --> 30:49.305
and, dare I say it, romance.

30:49.306 --> 30:52.183
Puffles the horse had faked,
yes, faked, his death by--

30:52.184 --> 30:54.894
I need the chair.

30:54.895 --> 30:57.522
- Sorry?
- That you're in?

30:57.523 --> 30:59.149
Oh, yes, quite.

31:08.075 --> 31:11.244
Oh, well.

31:11.245 --> 31:13.288
Here I am again.

31:13.289 --> 31:14.540
<i>Where?</i>

31:16.542 --> 31:17.918
Todd, you're...

31:19.420 --> 31:21.588
<i>...here.</i>

31:21.589 --> 31:24.465
But the case is over.

31:24.466 --> 31:25.717
How's your shoulder?

31:25.718 --> 31:27.051
It's...

31:27.052 --> 31:29.387
terrible, actually.

31:29.388 --> 31:32.849
Look I don't-- I don't understand...

31:32.850 --> 31:36.269
Did you want something from me? Or...

31:36.270 --> 31:37.353
I can't help you,

31:37.354 --> 31:39.522
I-I can't do anything
to help your situation, or what I said--

31:39.523 --> 31:41.691
I don't need help.

31:41.692 --> 31:42.818
Here.

31:44.361 --> 31:46.362
I got this from your apartment.

31:46.363 --> 31:49.324
Oh, um...

31:49.325 --> 31:51.910
That's a Mexican Funeral T-shirt.

31:51.911 --> 31:55.997
I don't have many left, so try not to...

31:55.998 --> 31:57.416
get shot in it.

32:00.878 --> 32:03.379
Look, I'm sorry,
but I don't understand.

32:03.380 --> 32:06.257
You're...

32:06.258 --> 32:08.093
What do you want?
Why are you here?

32:09.845 --> 32:12.472
I'm here because I'm your friend.

32:12.473 --> 32:13.514
Besides,

32:13.515 --> 32:16.018
I don't want to miss out
on when the next case starts.

32:19.980 --> 32:21.440
So--

32:24.735 --> 32:26.445
Didn't you say this band hated you?

32:27.780 --> 32:29.198
Yeah, well.

32:32.159 --> 32:34.453
We're late.
Farah wants to meet up.

32:35.037 --> 32:36.121
What? Really?

32:37.247 --> 32:39.791
Once Estevez gives us the all-clear,

32:39.792 --> 32:42.835
some people are going
to ask us some questions.

32:42.836 --> 32:44.420
Undoubtedly.
And how do we answer them?

32:44.421 --> 32:46.756
Well, yeah, we can't tell people
about the time machine,

32:46.757 --> 32:47.799
we'll sound insane.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.133
We don't want to sound insane.

32:49.134 --> 32:51.678
- No, we want to sound like sane guys--
- So sane, we're boring.

32:51.679 --> 32:55.556
Yeah, two boring, sane guys
having a... normal time.

32:55.557 --> 32:57.183
Let's say,
best-case scenario,

32:57.184 --> 33:01.187
we come out of this not arrested,
despite all the... deaths.

33:01.188 --> 33:04.190
- Yeah, the-the deaths.
- What then?

33:04.191 --> 33:07.276
I'd... like to make an investment

33:07.277 --> 33:08.861
in your detective agency.

33:08.862 --> 33:10.238
- Really?
- What?

33:10.239 --> 33:11.531
Uh....

33:11.532 --> 33:14.033
Bu-- Uh-- Bu-- Uh--
Bu-- Uh... But of course!

33:14.034 --> 33:16.619
I accept your proposal
as my venture capitalist.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.663
Proof of concept has clearly
already been established.

33:18.664 --> 33:21.165
But I remain quite firm on the signage.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.709
A brass plaque.

33:22.710 --> 33:25.753
"Dirk Gently's
Holistic Detective Agency"

33:25.754 --> 33:26.963
Name recognition and all that.

33:26.964 --> 33:29.757
I wouldn't want to muddy it
with a jumble of "Farahs" and "Todds."

33:29.758 --> 33:31.050
<i>It's cleaner this way.</i>

33:31.051 --> 33:34.178
And... how much
can I expect me to say yes to?

33:34.179 --> 33:36.556
If she's your partner,
I don't think it's fair to nix her name.

33:36.557 --> 33:40.727
No, I-I'd prefer my name
to remain off the...

33:40.728 --> 33:41.894
name.

33:41.895 --> 33:44.814
Ah.
So it's settled. And Todd.

33:44.815 --> 33:47.608
I feel like you're no longer an assistant.

33:47.609 --> 33:50.111
I'm promoting you to ward.

33:50.112 --> 33:52.947
Isn't that like a male nanny?
Yeah, I'm not...

33:52.948 --> 33:54.866
Okay, Dirk, you're pissing me off again.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.367
Oh, you don't like the title?

33:57.828 --> 33:59.579
<i>...Comme tu regardes au-dehors</i>

33:59.580 --> 34:02.206
<i>J'emporte un portrait dévoré</i>

34:02.207 --> 34:03.833
<i>Douleur destin bord à bord</i>

34:03.834 --> 34:07.046
<i>Here's my station...</i>

34:08.964 --> 34:12.800
<i>Here's my station</i>

34:12.801 --> 34:15.804
<i>Hoo, hoo, hoo...</i>

34:16.430 --> 34:21.268
<i>But if you say just one word
I'll stay with you</i>

34:23.103 --> 34:26.023
<i>Here's my station...</i>

34:28.067 --> 34:31.236
<i>Here's my station...</i>

34:43.123 --> 34:44.583
What the hell?

34:48.545 --> 34:51.172
Trying to cover up your tracks, ass--

34:51.173 --> 34:52.633
--hole?

34:56.678 --> 34:58.180
Why did you shoot me?

35:01.850 --> 35:03.184
Dang it.

35:03.185 --> 35:04.727
For Pete's sakes, now it's...

35:06.063 --> 35:08.231
No. No, this is...

35:08.232 --> 35:09.941
Oh, man, now it's...

35:09.942 --> 35:11.234
This is perfect.

35:11.235 --> 35:13.736
This is just so me.

35:13.737 --> 35:16.365
I don't know why I shot you.
Are you okay?

35:18.283 --> 35:20.368
Duh, no, sorry.

35:20.369 --> 35:22.620
You don't know what's going on?

35:22.621 --> 35:24.330
No, right, I-I know,

35:24.331 --> 35:27.500
about the body-swapping guys
and the machine?

35:27.501 --> 35:31.420
We just burned the Spring house down,
and cleaned that up,

35:31.421 --> 35:33.881
<i>and then we went and burned
their place down, too, at the zoo?</i>

35:33.882 --> 35:35.633
No, I've just been...

35:35.634 --> 35:37.593
burning everything down.

35:37.594 --> 35:39.428
We had a big file on that.

35:39.429 --> 35:42.348
<i>We have files on, like, everything.</i>

35:42.349 --> 35:44.892
I mean, what do they
want me to do, read 'em all?

35:44.893 --> 35:48.188
I can't do that. It's... it's boring.

35:48.856 --> 35:53.192
I-I...
I just wanted to be in charge,

35:53.193 --> 35:55.611
but what they don't tell you
is that once you're in charge,

35:55.612 --> 35:58.781
there's all this other, like...

35:58.782 --> 36:01.368
"Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah
top secret..." Blah!

36:02.619 --> 36:05.872
Do you know, they can't arrest me?

36:05.873 --> 36:08.332
Like, we're go gonna kill
the rest of those body-swapping guys,

36:08.333 --> 36:14.172
and it's all, like, top secret,
so it's off... of books,

36:14.173 --> 36:17.508
and all I had to do was write,
like, an email.

36:17.509 --> 36:20.595
And-and then, we're gonna
go get the, uh, the psychics, too,

36:20.596 --> 36:23.973
all the ones that we've been tracking,
and more.

36:23.974 --> 36:26.100
And they wouldn't let Riggins
do it, I guess,

36:26.101 --> 36:31.147
but they like me... more, better,

36:31.148 --> 36:35.777
because they gave me $80 million.

36:36.987 --> 36:41.282
We have kill everybody
who knows about it.

36:41.283 --> 36:42.366
So...

36:42.367 --> 36:46.078
- I guess I gotta kill you, too--
- No.

36:46.079 --> 36:47.872
No, you don't have to do that.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.999
You don't, um...

36:50.000 --> 36:52.460
I don't know anything.

36:52.461 --> 36:54.629
<i>I don't-I don't even
understand any of this.</i>

36:54.630 --> 36:56.339
I'm just trying to be a good cop.

36:57.841 --> 36:59.091
I'm just trying to be a good cop.

36:59.092 --> 37:00.218
Please, you don't...

37:00.219 --> 37:01.886
You don't have to...

37:01.887 --> 37:03.054
Please, man.

37:03.055 --> 37:04.556
Are you reaching for your gun right now?

37:19.363 --> 37:20.822
I'm just doing my job.

37:22.532 --> 37:25.409
- So, if we do this--
- We're already doing it.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.411
Well, how do we find a case?

37:27.412 --> 37:28.705
Just let yourself feel it.

37:29.665 --> 37:31.791
- Feel it?
- Yes.

37:31.792 --> 37:33.585
Okay, take a moment.

37:38.507 --> 37:39.633
Feel anything?

37:41.551 --> 37:42.886
Okay, close your eyes.

37:47.849 --> 37:49.142
Anything at all?

37:51.770 --> 37:53.313
I...

37:55.774 --> 37:57.025
To go to the bathroom.

37:59.236 --> 38:01.070
It's...

38:01.071 --> 38:02.864
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

38:09.579 --> 38:12.248
Farah, would you
excuse me for a moment?

38:12.249 --> 38:14.376
Just... a moment.

38:24.428 --> 38:25.637
Thanks.

38:46.700 --> 38:49.286
Vogle, get her out of here.

38:52.748 --> 38:54.290
- What?
- Go on, get!

38:54.291 --> 38:55.459
Run!

39:20.817 --> 39:22.235
You wanna rush?

39:24.946 --> 39:26.365
Let's rush!

39:48.762 --> 39:50.847
Let's get 'em, boys!

39:58.230 --> 39:59.648
Not now.

40:10.367 --> 40:11.576
Dirk?

40:25.507 --> 40:26.382
Amanda?

40:26.383 --> 40:28.050
<i>Todd! Todd!
Oh, my God, they're coming!</i>

40:28.051 --> 40:28.884
<i>- It's really bad!</i>
- What?

40:28.885 --> 40:30.719
What's happening?
Who's coming?

40:30.720 --> 40:31.637
<i>Todd, listen to me, you have to--</i>

40:31.638 --> 40:33.180
Wait, stay where you are.

40:33.181 --> 40:35.182
I'll find you.
You're gonna to be fine.

40:35.183 --> 40:36.726
You're gonna be fine--
Ah!

40:52.993 --> 40:55.953
<i>Todd? Todd!
What's happening? Todd!</i>

40:55.954 --> 40:58.289
<i>You are never gonna get</i>

40:58.290 --> 41:00.875
<i>Everything you want in this world</i>

41:00.876 --> 41:04.796
<i>First things first get what you deserve...</i>

41:15.849 --> 41:21.145
<i>It began when I was 21 years old</i>

41:21.146 --> 41:26.400
<i>And my mom and dad
were begging me to go</i>

41:26.401 --> 41:31.989
<i>So I left a note
and we went and hit the road</i>

41:31.990 --> 41:35.952
<i>Me and Chris and all the stuff I owned...</i>
