WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:02.825
- Previously on Haven...

00:03.545 --> 00:04.705
- Chief Wuornos.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.499
This is—
- Special Agent Audrey Parker.

00:07.049 --> 00:09.381
Oh! I'm sorry.
Are—are you all right?

00:09.468 --> 00:10.423
- Didn't feel it.

00:10.552 --> 00:12.133
- She know you're not a...

00:12.262 --> 00:13.377
a real boy?

00:13.514 --> 00:14.503
- You took my clothes.

00:14.598 --> 00:15.553
- I saved your life.

00:15.682 --> 00:16.592
- You must be Duke.

00:16.725 --> 00:18.886
- Don't need to say it.
- This is gonna suck.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.008
[tires squealing]

00:20.145 --> 00:21.385
- [screams]
- Watch out!

00:21.522 --> 00:23.353
I've been a lot of help
to you recently,

00:23.482 --> 00:25.347
and I was just hoping
for a little quid pro quo.

00:25.484 --> 00:26.564
- Ooh, that sounds illicit.

00:26.693 --> 00:27.899
- I was shooting for civil.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.609
What is this, a joke?

00:29.738 --> 00:31.524
What about the photographer
who took the picture?

00:31.657 --> 00:32.737
Where's the Colorado Kid buried?

00:32.866 --> 00:34.026
- You are the spitting image

00:34.159 --> 00:35.899
of someone
I sold flowers to years ago.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.367
- Wait.
W-w-what was her name?

00:37.496 --> 00:39.737
- Lucy!
I believe it was Lucy!

00:39.873 --> 00:41.249
- The troubles are back,
aren't they?

00:41.375 --> 00:42.535
- Yeah, I think so.

00:42.668 --> 00:45.250
- And I'm afraid
they won't go away this time.

00:56.848 --> 00:58.588
- Good morning.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.101
- Hi.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.934
- You look, uh...nice.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.394
- Wait.
What's that supposed to mean?

01:06.066 --> 01:07.272
- It means you look nice.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.767
- And yet somehow it doesn't
sound like a compliment.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.939
- [sighs]

01:12.072 --> 01:13.608
Are you on duty?
- Why?

01:13.740 --> 01:15.446
- Well, you're dressed
like you're on duty.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.531
Don't get me wrong.

01:16.660 --> 01:17.945
You—you pull it off
beautifully.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.615
- And that doesn't rate
better than nice?

01:20.747 --> 01:22.829
- You have a certain...

01:22.958 --> 01:24.619
federal-agent-chic thing
going on.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.161
- [chuckles]
Yeah.

01:26.295 --> 01:28.502
Hey, I wanted to ask you
a couple of questions.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.086
- Are these
work-related questions?

01:30.215 --> 01:31.796
- No, I'm—
I'm on my own time.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.462
I am looking
into a woman named Lucy.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.507
- You know,
I would love to help,

01:37.639 --> 01:39.504
but I think I've made it
pretty clear,

01:39.641 --> 01:40.756
I don't talk to cops,

01:40.892 --> 01:44.055
even cops that I like,
which...

01:44.187 --> 01:45.973
technically,
you would be the only one.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.186
So congratulations,

01:47.316 --> 01:49.602
but nonetheless,
I still don't do it.

01:49.735 --> 01:52.442
- That was almost a compliment—
heavy on the "almost."

01:52.571 --> 01:53.981
- I'll be more careful
next time.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.103
I do have plans.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.231
- Well, can—
can you just wait?

01:58.702 --> 02:01.944
- [speaking Russian]

02:03.415 --> 02:05.246
What?
Oh, relax.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.161
She's an aesthetician,
not an arms dealer.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.785
- You know, I could
make you talk to me.

02:09.921 --> 02:12.958
- Yeah, I suppose you could.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.080
Or...

02:14.217 --> 02:16.594
you could make life
a whole lot easier on yourself

02:16.720 --> 02:18.927
and just wait till I'm
in a more cooperative mood.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.967
- Fine.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.182
Later.

02:24.311 --> 02:25.471
- Enjoy.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.265
Hey, Audrey,
you should go check out

02:27.397 --> 02:28.853
the Haven farmers' market.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.722
Have a snow cone.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.565
Let me know how it is.

02:34.529 --> 02:35.518
Forgive me.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.066
I don't know.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.098
- Is this some kind ofjoke?

03:14.152 --> 03:15.688
- What are you
talking about, Kat?

03:15.821 --> 03:16.776
- This is rotten!

03:16.905 --> 03:18.236
- I'm sorry.
Is there a problem here?

03:18.365 --> 03:19.571
- If you're selling
rotten stock to us,

03:19.700 --> 03:20.689
the chef is gonna
throw a fit.

03:20.826 --> 03:21.736
- You're crazy.

03:21.868 --> 03:22.983
There's nothing wrong
with my apples.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.532
- What does this look like?
- A candy apple.

03:26.581 --> 03:28.082
- Hold on. Hold on.
I just dipped those.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.199
My apples are fine.

03:31.294 --> 03:32.704
My God,
what the hell is this?

03:33.588 --> 03:36.580
[crowd gasping and scoffing]

03:39.553 --> 03:41.009
- [coughing]

03:45.392 --> 03:47.474
- [coughing]

03:47.602 --> 03:48.762
- What's going on here?

03:48.895 --> 03:50.635
- No, no, they were fine
this morning!

03:50.772 --> 03:51.761
- I can't believe this.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.058
- Somebody framed us.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.182
- [coughing]

03:55.318 --> 03:56.979
- Somebody call an ambulance.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.107
[dramatic music]

04:03.243 --> 04:11.241
J‘J‘

04:36.818 --> 04:38.103
- Okay, thank you.
That would help.

04:38.236 --> 04:39.567
- Trouble
at the farmers' market.

04:39.696 --> 04:40.936
You're here.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.858
Cause and effect?
- [chuckles]

04:42.991 --> 04:44.447
Funny.

04:45.744 --> 04:46.733
- So what happened?

04:49.122 --> 04:50.077
- This...

04:50.207 --> 04:53.699
used to be sweet corn.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.621
- Big deal.
I've seen worse in my fridge.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.621
- Yeah, can your fridge
do this in 30 seconds?

04:58.757 --> 04:59.997
- A biological agent?

05:00.133 --> 05:02.249
- Yeah, a disease,
a weird fungus.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.512
- Chemicals,
drunk crop duster.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.174
- Yeah, I may not have
your sensitive nose,

05:06.306 --> 05:08.592
but I think
I would have smelled that one.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.558
- Well, they'll test
for everything.

05:12.687 --> 05:15.349
I mean, whatever it was
had an area effect.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.473
- But it hit just a few carts,
you know?

05:17.609 --> 05:18.974
Why not all of them?

05:19.110 --> 05:21.317
- You think they were targeted?
- Possibly.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.687
But you know what's weird?
Is the timing.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.906
All of this went bad
at the same time.

05:27.869 --> 05:28.779
- Okay.

05:28.912 --> 05:31.574
Let's go check out
these farms.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.576
Hamish Stewart?

05:37.712 --> 05:39.998
Nathan Wuornos,
Haven Police.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.792
Sorry to bother you.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.461
This is Officer Parker.

05:43.593 --> 05:44.799
- Uh, is it all like that?

05:44.928 --> 05:47.135
- There's a whole crib
in the barn.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.129
And that's what I get
for going organic.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.052
- You don't use chemicals?

05:51.184 --> 05:53.721
- My life partner
is a vegan—the fool.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.345
I guess you can blame Angus
for this.

05:58.900 --> 05:59.889
- Came back here and found

06:00.026 --> 06:01.732
several more bad eggs
in the nests—

06:01.862 --> 06:04.319
but only in this coop,
not in the other ones.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.438
- Are they all
on organic feed?

06:06.575 --> 06:08.531
- That's where the money is,
sweetie.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.901
- And what's the difference
between these two coops?

06:11.037 --> 06:13.244
- Well, this one's
for the horny hens...

06:14.374 --> 06:16.114
Fertilized eggs.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.583
Do you think
my rooster's sick?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.373
- Well, the lab'll test him,
I'm sure.

06:20.505 --> 06:23.713
- Well, he looks okay—
still chasing the hens.

06:23.842 --> 06:26.709
Not all of 'em mind
getting caught.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.759
- So we're asking
that any affected farmers

06:31.892 --> 06:34.850
give us paperwork on their
customers and suppliers.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.310
- This is really what
you ought to be looking at.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.361
- I got the guys digging
through the farmers' paperwork.

06:54.497 --> 06:55.623
- Well, why so selective?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.535
You know, one plot
out of a whole orchard,

06:57.667 --> 07:00.579
one henhouse,
one crib of corn out of a dozen.

07:00.712 --> 07:01.792
And why these stands?

07:01.922 --> 07:03.458
- Have you thought
about calling the bureau?

07:03.590 --> 07:04.705
- I wasn't planning on it,

07:04.841 --> 07:07.298
but I'd like to have something
to tell them first—anything.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.760
- Here, you can show them this—
prelim tox report.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.004
- Hydrochloric acid?

07:12.140 --> 07:14.131
- Mm.
It's not a biological agent.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.598
- It's not a weaponized one.

07:15.727 --> 07:17.433
That's a stomach acid.
[cell phone ringing]

07:17.562 --> 07:19.177
That doesn't get on tops
of trees and in eggs

07:19.314 --> 07:20.520
unless somebody
puts it there.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.310
- Mm.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.852
Wuornos.

07:28.323 --> 07:29.984
Eleanor, what happened?

07:30.116 --> 07:31.981
- The entire
high school sailing team—

07:32.118 --> 07:34.029
GI distress,
nausea, cramping.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.698
- Any idea what caused it?

07:35.830 --> 07:38.037
- Postrace treats?

07:38.166 --> 07:40.578
- Ah, hell.
Benjy?

07:40.710 --> 07:42.450
- Who's Benjy?

07:42.587 --> 07:46.079
- Ice cream, homemade in Haven.
Been going since I was a kid.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.831
And how do you not love
meeting the cow

07:47.968 --> 07:49.253
who made
your ice cream possible?

07:49.386 --> 07:51.627
- Wait. Now, back up.
The cows live at the store?

07:51.763 --> 07:54.345
Isn't that a zoning problem,
at a minimum?

07:54.474 --> 07:56.510
- It's more like you put
the store where the cows live.

07:56.643 --> 07:59.134
It's never been a problem.
Been there for 40 years.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.180
- All right,
so what's the common thread—

08:00.313 --> 08:01.223
farms, animals?

08:01.356 --> 08:03.017
- Let's find out.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.599
He likes his naps.

08:05.735 --> 08:08.112
[pounding on door]

08:08.238 --> 08:11.730
- Hey, little Nate.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.822
[laughing]

08:13.952 --> 08:14.987
- Benjy.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.327
- Your knocking
woke me up.

08:17.455 --> 08:20.117
- Benjy, did you have
any problems at the store today?

08:20.250 --> 08:21.456
- Not that I'm aware.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.870
But you know me—
I could sleep through a rodeo.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.461
- Do you mind if we take
a look in the freezer?

08:26.589 --> 08:28.090
- Of course not.

08:28.216 --> 08:31.049
But, uh,
what's going on?

08:31.177 --> 08:33.133
- Well, something happened
over at Haven Academy.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.254
Some kids got sick.
- On my bars?

08:35.390 --> 08:36.846
- Well, we don't know
exactly what—

08:36.975 --> 08:39.512
- Yeah. Now we do.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.476
- What happened?

08:42.605 --> 08:43.890
- Are your cows here?

08:44.024 --> 08:45.184
- Out back.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.227
Oh! Girls!

08:50.363 --> 08:52.445
Oh!

08:52.574 --> 08:54.155
Oh, Janis!

08:54.284 --> 08:55.820
- No, don't touch!

08:57.871 --> 09:00.829
- [gasps]

09:03.001 --> 09:05.208
Oh, no.
Oh, God, no.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.641
- What's this stuff?

09:22.771 --> 09:24.853
- You want to be a local?
Helps to look like one.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.972
- [laughs]

09:27.108 --> 09:29.440
Thanks, Nathan.
That's—that's really sweet.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.150
But I thought
I just had to squint a lot

09:31.279 --> 09:32.815
and leave out half my words.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.107
- That'd be a start.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.696
- All right, so I'm still
trying to figure out

09:35.825 --> 09:37.861
what these incidents
have in common.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.234
Do you have
the vendor report?

09:39.370 --> 09:40.746
- Yeah, right here.

09:40.872 --> 09:42.203
- And?

09:42.332 --> 09:43.868
- There's a common thread,

09:46.457 --> 09:46.586
but I can't believe the McShaws
have anything to do with this.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.951
- Wait. The Mc-whos?

09:48.088 --> 09:49.043
- Bill and Geoff McShaw.

09:49.172 --> 09:51.128
They're brothers that run
the Second Chance Bistro.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.417
All these vendors supply them.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.960
- So you think that somebody's
trying to hurt them

09:54.094 --> 09:54.958
through their suppliers?

09:55.095 --> 09:56.005
That's a reach.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.673
- Yeah, it's a big one.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.548
- There was a woman

10:01.684 --> 10:03.720
yelling at an apple vendor
at the market—

10:03.853 --> 10:05.935
something about a chef
getting mad.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.975
- Oh, that sounds like Geoff.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.144
He's pretty good
at getting mad.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.938
Let's go talk to him.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.691
-Go...

10:16.825 --> 10:18.406
- Black Bears!

10:18.535 --> 10:21.322
- Yeah, this local thing
is gonna take a while.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.707
- The place has been
in their family for ages.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.498
Bill stuck around and took over
after their folks died.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.541
Nice guy.
- And Geoff?

10:32.674 --> 10:34.084
- Talented and knows it.

10:34.217 --> 10:35.582
Studied cooking
all over the world

10:35.718 --> 10:37.003
and just got back in town.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.343
They're reopening
with a menu

10:38.471 --> 10:40.086
featuring only
local ingredients.

10:40.223 --> 10:42.384
- You can cook pine trees?

10:44.018 --> 10:44.928
- Hey, Bill.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.096
- Hiya, Nathan.

10:46.229 --> 10:48.094
- This is Officer Parker,
my new partner.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.812
- I thought Geoff
was just being dramatic.

10:49.941 --> 10:51.056
- Dramatic about what?

10:51.192 --> 10:54.355
- A lot of food's
gone bad recently.

10:55.446 --> 10:56.697
He made a beautiful
corn and apple fritter

10:56.823 --> 10:58.279
to go with the entree tonight,
and look what happened.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.899
- Corn and apples?
Did—did he use eggs in there?

11:01.035 --> 11:03.321
- Yeah, sure.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.035
I thought we were just getting
a run of bad stock.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.245
- Can we talk to Geoff?

11:06.374 --> 11:07.614
- Yeah, he's...

11:07.750 --> 11:08.956
inside.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.825
- Any idea
why someone would be out

11:10.962 --> 11:12.042
to hurt your business?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.207
- Jealousy.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.204
Isaac, your knife skills
are better than that.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.956
Check the stove.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.425
He belongs
in a cafeteria.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.175
Ah, everyone,
check this out.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.674
This is a proper dice.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.765
No sesame seeds, all right?

11:29.898 --> 11:31.308
What, are you trying
to make me sick?

11:31.441 --> 11:33.602
It, uh, muddies the flavor.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.814
I'm counting on you
to get this right.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.528
- Let's talk
about your enemies.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.522
- I have fans, not enemies.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.115
- The Times says,
"Geoffrey McShaw

11:43.244 --> 11:44.984
"is evocative
and challenging,

11:45.121 --> 11:46.361
a chef of the future."

11:46.497 --> 11:47.657
- I rest my case.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.371
- Well, could there be
competitors

11:49.500 --> 11:50.580
out to disrupt you?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.416
- Competition—
no one this side of Portland

11:52.545 --> 11:53.955
is doing what I'm doing.

11:55.506 --> 11:56.757
- This guy's been, uh,
coming by.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.589
Keeps looking over
the building—John Robert.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.586
- What exactly
is a lobster pup?

12:02.722 --> 12:04.804
- It's kind of like
a hot dog with...

12:04.933 --> 12:06.048
lobster.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.141
It's not my thing.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.977
But it's working for him.
He's got 20 locations.

12:12.106 --> 12:14.643
- Yeah, it's possible.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.607
Look, is there anyone
closer to you

12:16.736 --> 12:17.851
that we could look at?

12:17.987 --> 12:20.319
- We did fire a few people
a couple months ago.

12:21.157 --> 12:24.991
- Ah, this is something new.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.195
Seared squab with tarragon.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.196
- Squab?
Is that pigeon?

12:30.333 --> 12:31.743
- Free-range organic pigeon.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.412
We raise them on the roof.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.876
- Yo-ho, boys,
delivery.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.506
Well, well, well.

12:37.632 --> 12:39.168
Look who's here.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.585
How was the farmers' market?

12:40.718 --> 12:42.549
- Not so great,
thanks to you.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.098
How was your afternoon?

12:46.224 --> 12:47.430
- Entertaining.

12:47.558 --> 12:48.513
- Really?

12:48.643 --> 12:51.305
- You're looking lovely.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.224
You're looking very...
Nathan-y.

12:54.357 --> 12:55.267
- Yeah.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.606
- What do you got?

12:56.734 --> 12:58.599
Wow.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.773
Really? Still?
The pigeon?

13:01.906 --> 13:03.191
- You're gonna like this,
all right?

13:03.324 --> 13:04.439
Just—just—just you wait.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.156
- No, no, no,
I'm sure that I would,

13:06.286 --> 13:07.492
if I actually
put it in mouth,

13:07.620 --> 13:10.202
which, um,
isn't gonna happen.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.992
-So...

13:12.125 --> 13:14.992
what have you got
for me today?

13:15.128 --> 13:16.117
- $500 to find out.

13:16.254 --> 13:18.210
- What, dollars?
For that crate?

13:18.339 --> 13:20.295
- Meg, just in time.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.541
- For what?
- Uh, mystery crate day.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.668
- Sometimes it's uni
from the Sea of Japan

13:24.804 --> 13:26.590
or yellowtail cheeks
from Ecuador.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.213
- Either way,
he has to pay first.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.509
That's the game.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.927
- Nothing black market,
of course.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.802
- No.
Of course not, Nathan.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.679
- $500 is on the steep side.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.226
- I don't think
we can do this right now.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.565
With the reopening costs,
it's—

13:39.694 --> 13:40.558
- We—we have to.

13:40.695 --> 13:41.775
Bill, tell your wife—

13:41.904 --> 13:43.360
in for a penny,
in for a pound.

13:43.489 --> 13:46.151
This is what makes us better
than everyone else.

13:46.284 --> 13:49.071
- Now, money is one thing.

13:49.203 --> 13:52.070
But getting
on the wrong side of Meg

13:52.206 --> 13:54.743
is on top
of my "don't" list.

13:54.876 --> 13:56.082
This one's on me.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.667
- I'll take "free"
for an answer.

14:01.716 --> 14:03.126
- I can't do that, Duke.

14:03.259 --> 14:06.296
- All right, l-l know that
it's been probably 20 years,

14:06.429 --> 14:07.635
but I can still kick
your butt.

14:07.764 --> 14:08.844
Take your check back.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.720
- Everything we've seen
ties in to this place.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.218
- You think
someone's after Geoff?

14:15.355 --> 14:16.720
- He says he has no enemies,
but still,

14:16.856 --> 14:18.687
an angry sister-in-law,
a jealous brother.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.273
- A wannabe fast-food tycoon
sizing up his storefront.

14:21.402 --> 14:22.562
- Yeah, but still,
why attack

14:22.695 --> 14:24.526
through four different suppliers
and with acid?

14:24.655 --> 14:26.236
That just—
it doesn't make sense.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.231
[bird squawks]

14:28.368 --> 14:29.949
What was that?

14:30.078 --> 14:32.114
[birds squawking]

14:34.665 --> 14:35.700
- Get in.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.283
Raining birds?

14:38.419 --> 14:40.876
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.548
- [gasps]

14:46.928 --> 14:48.634
I've seen this movie.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.378
It doesn't end well.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.809
- The poor guys.

15:00.942 --> 15:03.228
- You were raising them
to cook them.

15:03.361 --> 15:04.601
- Yeah, but this?

15:04.737 --> 15:06.238
This is wrong.

15:06.364 --> 15:07.900
- Are you sure
that nobody comes to mind

15:08.032 --> 15:10.614
that might have a problem
with Geoff or the restaurant?

15:10.743 --> 15:13.405
- The biggest problem
with Geoff is Meg.

15:13.538 --> 15:14.948
I don't think
she'd do this, but...

15:15.081 --> 15:16.070
- But...

15:16.207 --> 15:18.118
- There's definitely
tension between them.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.617
Geoff basically came back
to bail Bill out, okay?

15:20.753 --> 15:22.789
Geoff could be in New York
or London.

15:22.922 --> 15:23.911
He should be.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.254
But Bill needed help.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.294
I don't think Meg
liked him needing it.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.260
Look, I got to go back, okay?
- Go ahead.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.100
Resentment's a motive.

15:35.226 --> 15:36.557
- Yeah.

15:36.686 --> 15:39.393
Ugh, I can smell
the acid in this thing.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.262
You think Meg would do this?

15:41.399 --> 15:42.639
- Someone did.

15:44.735 --> 15:46.145
- This is amazing.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.565
- I grow most of the herbs
we use at the restaurant,

15:48.698 --> 15:49.904
some produce too.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.772
- It's perfect.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.991
- It's my refuge.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.156
Bill can be around Geoff
all day at the restaurant,

15:56.289 --> 15:58.371
but I'm not his brother.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.239
- You don't like
your brother-in-law?

16:00.376 --> 16:02.458
- I hate how he treats
my husband.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.168
I'd walk away from Geoff
and this place

16:04.297 --> 16:06.003
in a heartbeat
if I could.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.338
- But Bill won't go?

16:07.467 --> 16:10.379
- Three generations of McShaws
have owned that place.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.843
Bill's held it together
all by himself for years.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.052
-So...

16:14.182 --> 16:16.514
why did he ask Geoff
to come back?

16:16.642 --> 16:19.179
- Their parents made them
promise to keep the business.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.645
Bill is nothing
if not faithful to his word.

16:22.773 --> 16:25.731
But Geoff‘s
the restaurant genius,

16:25.860 --> 16:28.021
not Bill.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.769
You see that?

16:29.906 --> 16:31.521
That's Bill's gift.

16:31.657 --> 16:32.942
You give Bill
a piece of wood,

16:33.075 --> 16:35.691
and he'll make
something wonderful.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.695
- So Bill puts Geoff first.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.208
- Geoff puts Geoff first.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.619
He doesn't appreciate Bill

16:42.752 --> 16:45.243
or how much Bill gave up
to keep their promise,

16:45.379 --> 16:46.368
and he never will.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.871
- Sounds like you resent him.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.124
- His overspending,
his quest for the perfect dish—

16:51.260 --> 16:54.002
he's put us in a spot that,
if this reopening doesn't work,

16:54.138 --> 16:56.220
we'll lose everything.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.556
I guess you could say
I resent him.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.802
- What happened
to your tarragon?

17:02.939 --> 17:04.395
- I'm not sure.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.389
When I came out today,
it was like that.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.662
- Mr. Robert,
you still supervise deliveries?

17:21.791 --> 17:23.247
- Time is money, Detective.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.708
You don't grow to 17 locations
by watching every penny.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.121
Labor costs more than food.

17:27.255 --> 17:28.415
- Lobster's cheap?

17:28.548 --> 17:30.755
- Lobster pup
is a processed seafood product.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.168
Seasoned right,
tastes the same—

17:32.301 --> 17:33.586
no lobster necessary.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.755
Here's a coupon—free side
with any regular order.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.628
I recommend the hush puppies.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.380
- I'll pass.

17:39.517 --> 17:40.927
Want to tell me
why you're interested

17:41.060 --> 17:43.301
in the Second Chance?

17:43.437 --> 17:44.893
Doesn't seem like
your kind of place.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.523
- Location's more important
than costs.

17:46.649 --> 17:47.809
- Is that so?

17:47.942 --> 17:49.398
- I want a mother ship
for the Lobster Pup chain,

17:49.527 --> 17:50.937
and they've got the best views
in Haven.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.401
- Is that why you sabotaged
their business?

17:52.530 --> 17:53.440
- No need to.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.154
The way Geoff
mismanages product costs,

17:55.283 --> 17:56.489
he's doing it himself.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.699
Let's just say
I'm on his speed dial.

18:02.248 --> 18:05.285
- Margie, you here?

18:05.418 --> 18:06.703
We're here for your ad copy.

18:10.256 --> 18:11.245
- Oh.

18:11.382 --> 18:12.292
- Hi.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.917
- Hi, Margie's upstairs
getting her phone.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.839
- Sure.
- Anytime.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.302
- Oh, do I have a...

18:22.435 --> 18:23.641
Is there a zipper undone?

18:23.769 --> 18:25.305
- No, no, it's not that.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.929
- Uh, it's just
that you look, uh...

18:29.191 --> 18:31.648
Nice.
- Nice?

18:31.777 --> 18:33.813
Yeah, I've been getting
a lot of that lately.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.402
I'm trying
to find something

18:35.531 --> 18:37.738
to wear to this
restaurant opening tonight.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.778
- Uh, yes, of course.

18:39.910 --> 18:42.526
The McShaw boys are having
trouble again, aren't they?

18:42.663 --> 18:44.164
- Uh, always figured Duke

18:44.290 --> 18:46.155
would get them in hot water
sooner or later.

18:46.292 --> 18:49.159
- I don't think he has anything
to do with their problems.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.462
Will you guys look at me?

18:55.259 --> 18:57.591
Okay, what's wrong?
Is it too professional?

18:57.720 --> 18:58.755
- No.
- No.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.128
- Not professional.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.879
But it is too, uh...

19:02.016 --> 19:02.926
sunny?

19:03.059 --> 19:04.014
- Yeah, exactly.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.644
Uh, a bit sunny.

19:05.770 --> 19:08.512
- l-l don't do sunny.
Okay.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.606
Can you just—can you hold on,
just right there?

19:11.734 --> 19:14.146
I'll try a—great.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.436
- Ah.

19:17.573 --> 19:18.904
Oh!

19:20.951 --> 19:22.031
Uh...

19:23.287 --> 19:25.027
It's a little...branchy.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.028
- Leafy-branchy.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.996
- Okay, no.

19:29.835 --> 19:30.790
- It's a little girly.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.376
- Thin straps.
- Okay, all right.

19:32.505 --> 19:36.043
l-l'm gonna try
just a couple—couple more.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.041
- It's too rococo.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.510
- It's an old lady's color.
- It's de rigueur.

19:41.639 --> 19:43.550
- Oh...
[chuckling]

19:43.683 --> 19:44.889
- Uh!
- Oh!

19:47.186 --> 19:48.972
It's purple.
- Mauve.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.185
- I hate purple.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.147
Try this.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.355
- Really?

19:54.485 --> 19:55.770
I don't think—

19:55.903 --> 19:58.360
I can't believe you guys
are giving me fashion advice.

19:58.489 --> 20:00.445
- She should have
come to us sooner.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.314
- A lot sooner.

20:04.495 --> 20:06.486
' [giggles]

20:09.834 --> 20:11.916
[sighs]
You're staring again.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.535
- But in a good way
this time.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.338
That sounded creepy,
even to me.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.547
- It's perfect.

20:19.677 --> 20:21.383
- Thank you.
Thank you.

20:21.512 --> 20:23.048
Thank you.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.011
- She's lucky we came in
when we did.

20:25.141 --> 20:27.257
- She sure is.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.429
But she did look
splendid, though.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.427
- Yeah, and you look
100 years old,

20:31.564 --> 20:33.020
so forget about it.

20:37.027 --> 20:39.894
[soft music playing]

20:40.030 --> 20:46.947
J‘J‘

20:47.079 --> 20:48.740
- Thank you.

20:52.585 --> 20:53.950
- Well, I was watching
the kitchen.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.953
I didn't see
anything suspicious.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.421
John Robert hasn't done anything
but have too many drinks.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.259
- All right, I have a theory.
- Surprise.

21:04.388 --> 21:05.924
- You're not gonna like it.
- Surprise again.

21:06.056 --> 21:07.432
- Geoff cooks fritters,

21:07.558 --> 21:09.970
all the ingredients he uses
go bad at the market.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.309
He cooks squab,
pigeons fall from the sky.

21:12.438 --> 21:15.475
I was in Meg's garden today,
and all the tarragon—dead,

21:15.608 --> 21:17.974
the same tarragon that he used
to cook the squab.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.226
- Parker—
- Everything Geoff cooks dies...

21:20.362 --> 21:22.648
- Parker—
- The flocks, the orchards.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.068
- And the Benjy bars.
- No idea...

21:25.201 --> 21:26.657
except for that I'm out
of good answers.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.448
- So we should embrace
bad ones?

21:29.580 --> 21:31.070
- No.
- Officer Parker.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.828
Nathan.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.668
Careful, now.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.665
It's the quiet ones
you have to watch out for.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.837
- Contribute any contraband
to tonight's menu?

21:43.969 --> 21:46.426
- Well, we'll have to see
what Geoff made.

21:50.601 --> 21:51.590
- Am I interrupting something?

21:53.979 --> 21:56.356
Excuse me, Audrey.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.518
Well, it's all yours now, lads.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.315
It's about time.

22:03.447 --> 22:06.234
- It's hard not to still see
our folks' place, you know?

22:06.367 --> 22:09.029
- Not unless
you deep-fry the pigeon.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.538
- Which might not be
such a bad start.

22:13.833 --> 22:14.788
- Excuse me.

22:14.917 --> 22:17.158
Can I have
your attention, please?

22:17.294 --> 22:19.410
Our first course,

22:19.547 --> 22:22.459
a dandelion-green salad
with crisp basil,

22:22.591 --> 22:23.671
fresh from our garden.

22:23.801 --> 22:25.041
Enjoy.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.713
- I'm gonna go test my theory.

22:26.846 --> 22:30.054
I'll be right back.
Just don't—don't eat anything.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.760
- Here's that list
of old employees.

22:36.897 --> 22:37.886
- Thanks.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.986
I'm surprised
you invited him here.

22:43.112 --> 22:44.693
You know, he's interested
in the place.

22:44.822 --> 22:46.562
- Ah, he asked my brother
to sell his half.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.155
Geoff said neither of us
would do that.

22:48.284 --> 22:49.239
- I hate to say it, Bill,

22:49.368 --> 22:50.983
but you might want
to double-check that.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.083
- So my theory was brilliant
but completely wrong.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.175
He cooked with the basil,
but the garden's fine.

23:09.305 --> 23:10.385
- Shocker.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.505
- Did you tell John Robert
that you would consider?

23:12.641 --> 23:14.381
- Lower your voice, please.
It's not the time or the place.

23:14.518 --> 23:15.428
- I think it's exactly the time.

23:15.561 --> 23:16.425
- It's not the time
or the place.

23:16.562 --> 23:18.553
Do what you do best—
meet and greet.

23:21.442 --> 23:22.727
- What is that about?

23:22.860 --> 23:23.975
- I think Bill just found out

23:24.111 --> 23:26.773
that Geoff‘s
on John Robert's speed dial.

23:28.490 --> 23:29.616
- Attention, please.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.107
A toast.

23:31.243 --> 23:35.407
It takes patience and effort
to make a dream come true.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.620
But once it does...

23:40.753 --> 23:42.414
you always seem
to have another one.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.211
To a dream come true.

23:45.341 --> 23:47.753
[glasses clink]
- Hear! Hear!

23:47.885 --> 23:49.091
- Enjoy the salmon.

24:00.189 --> 24:01.770
- Look down.

24:10.741 --> 24:13.448
[people coughing]

24:24.129 --> 24:26.040
So much for preventing
the next attack.

24:28.008 --> 24:28.997
- Don't worry.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.510
It'll be fine, Geoff.

24:30.636 --> 24:31.967
- Fine?
It's not going to be fine.

24:32.096 --> 24:33.506
It's a disaster!

24:33.639 --> 24:36.130
- "It all works out, Kitty-Kat."
Isn't that what you always say?

24:37.142 --> 24:38.302
- Damn it!

24:38.435 --> 24:39.424
- That's enough, Geoff.

24:39.561 --> 24:40.846
I put everything I have
on the line for you,

24:40.980 --> 24:42.436
help you push
this high-end concept

24:42.564 --> 24:44.100
you want so badly,
and you serve garbage!

24:44.233 --> 24:47.066
- I've got much more
to lose than you.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.230
Do you know the risk
that I took with my reputation

24:49.363 --> 24:50.523
to even come here
and help you?

24:50.656 --> 24:51.691
- Help me?

24:51.824 --> 24:53.189
Or sell me out to John Robert?

24:53.325 --> 24:56.192
- Yeah, I was an idiot
to come here and help you.

24:56.328 --> 24:59.320
And if you don't appreciate
what I'm trying to do, then...

24:59.456 --> 25:01.162
l-l'm happy to leave.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.906
- Good.
- Where you gonna go?

25:03.043 --> 25:05.785
- I have a standing offer
to chef at Red Fish Blue.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.627
- With Justine?

25:07.756 --> 25:10.668
But you said
you'd never go back to her.

25:10.801 --> 25:12.632
- To work for her,

25:12.761 --> 25:14.217
not to be with her.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.211
- Well, then take me with you.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.509
- Katarina,
you're the best sous around,

25:18.642 --> 25:21.634
all right, but you wouldn't
last a day in New York.

25:26.442 --> 25:28.774
- Runnin' out again?
No more second chances?

25:30.779 --> 25:32.235
- I'm all out of them.

25:37.119 --> 25:39.155
Take the knife.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.285
- No, don't.
Don't go, Geoff. Stay.

25:44.418 --> 25:46.204
- I can't keep
bailing you out.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.164
You're on your own
this time.

25:53.135 --> 25:54.250
[chuckles]

25:54.386 --> 25:56.047
- Come on.

26:12.404 --> 26:15.521
- Well, it wasn't
Geoff‘s cooking.

26:15.657 --> 26:18.444
- I was watching the food
the whole time.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.738
I don't get it.

26:20.871 --> 26:22.202
- Yeah.

26:24.041 --> 26:25.656
Neither do I.

26:37.429 --> 26:40.045
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

26:40.182 --> 26:42.138
- Thought you'd want
to see this.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.427
- What happened?

26:48.190 --> 26:50.932
Geoff.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.241
What the hell?

27:15.342 --> 27:17.833
- Do you really think
that I would hurt Geoff?

27:17.970 --> 27:19.130
- No, I don't.

27:19.263 --> 27:21.345
We need to know
what you saw.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.429
- He showed up here late.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.675
He was upset about
what happened at the dinner.

27:25.811 --> 27:26.971
- Did he blame anybody?

27:27.104 --> 27:29.265
- Geoff, he blamed everybody.

27:29.398 --> 27:32.265
- Anyone in particular?

27:32.401 --> 27:34.392
- No.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.694
I know that he seemed
like a monster,

27:37.823 --> 27:39.154
but he wasn't.

27:41.160 --> 27:44.027
Outside of the kitchen,
he was a good guy.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.653
- Why'd he come
to see you last night?

27:45.789 --> 27:47.905
- Because he was upset, Nathan.

27:48.041 --> 27:49.497
He needed somebody
to talk to.

27:49.626 --> 27:53.039
He told me about the fight
he had with his brother.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.288
He felt trapped.

27:55.424 --> 27:57.665
- So what was all this business
with the knife?

28:04.349 --> 28:07.136
- When I was a kid,

28:07.269 --> 28:09.635
I had a pellet gun.

28:11.899 --> 28:13.514
We shot a duck.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.311
Later, when Geoff tried
to cook it,

28:15.444 --> 28:18.402
it escaped
and came flapping at us.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.236
Scared the crap out of us.

28:22.326 --> 28:23.736
Bill tried to put it
out of its misery

28:23.869 --> 28:26.781
with a pocket knife.

28:26.914 --> 28:29.246
Geoff stopped him.

28:29.374 --> 28:33.413
Said, "Maybe it deserves
a second chance."

28:33.545 --> 28:37.003
Geoff used the pocket knife
to make us

28:37.132 --> 28:40.374
peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches instead.

28:40.510 --> 28:43.092
Ever since then,
we've been

28:43.222 --> 28:46.259
giving each other
second chances.

28:46.391 --> 28:50.259
Hence, the name
of the restaurant.

28:50.395 --> 28:51.680
[sighs]

28:54.066 --> 28:57.524
It was meant to be
a second chance for them.

28:57.653 --> 29:00.235
- So you talked.
And...

29:00.364 --> 29:02.605
- I told him that I would
help him in any way I could.

29:02.741 --> 29:06.404
He said he didn't feel well.

29:06.536 --> 29:08.197
And he left.

29:11.833 --> 29:12.788
I heard a noise on the dock.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.624
I didn't...

29:14.753 --> 29:16.163
think anything of it.

29:16.296 --> 29:18.161
I thought he tripped,
all right?

29:26.598 --> 29:30.807
- I think I'm gonna go talk
to Meg and Bill again.

29:30.936 --> 29:33.643
- I'm gonna go find
John Robert.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.637
- Why John Robert?

29:35.774 --> 29:38.265
- He was the last call
made on Geoff‘s cell.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.451
- You know,
Geoff hated the water.

29:57.587 --> 29:58.838
He did.

29:58.964 --> 30:01.706
He got sick
every time we took him out.

30:01.842 --> 30:03.673
In fact,
I think he cooked fish

30:03.802 --> 30:06.714
as a revenge on the ocean.

30:08.598 --> 30:10.054
And then he died in it.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.263
It's a shame.

30:14.396 --> 30:15.602
Any other circumstance,

30:15.731 --> 30:18.188
I would have appreciated
the irony.

30:21.403 --> 30:24.486
It's one hell
of a grand opening, huh?

30:24.614 --> 30:26.946
- They'll never forget it,
that's for sure.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.611
- By the way, you looked nice
in that dress last night.

30:33.957 --> 30:36.118
- There it is again,
"nice."

30:38.462 --> 30:40.123
- I meant nice.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.542
- Thank you.

30:49.514 --> 30:50.970
- It's just nice
to see another side

30:51.099 --> 30:52.930
of Officer-Agent Parker.

30:53.060 --> 30:55.267
- I am pretty sure you saw
every single side of me

30:55.395 --> 30:56.726
the day we met

30:56.855 --> 30:58.686
when you fished me
out of the water.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.646
- It's a shame you're a cop.

31:03.779 --> 31:05.064
- And why is that?

31:05.197 --> 31:06.858
- I don't usually
socialize with cops.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.606
- Did it ever occur to you that
that might be their choice?

31:11.203 --> 31:12.238
- No.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.241
[chuckles]

31:19.211 --> 31:21.668
- Hey, I know it's not
gonna fix anything,

31:21.797 --> 31:24.379
but I'm gonna figure out
what happened to your friend.

31:26.051 --> 31:27.712
- I know you will...

31:30.722 --> 31:33.464
Officer-Agent Parker.

31:37.979 --> 31:39.435
- You think I killed him?

31:39.564 --> 31:41.976
- He called you,
and then he died.

31:42.109 --> 31:43.645
You wanted to buy him out.

31:43.777 --> 31:45.608
- l-l don't want
that building anymore, okay?

31:45.737 --> 31:47.693
He—he destroyed
the energy of the place.

31:47.823 --> 31:48.687
- You told that to Geoff?

31:48.824 --> 31:49.779
- From my hospital bed,

31:49.908 --> 31:51.569
after I had my stomach pumped.

31:51.701 --> 31:53.282
l-l withdrew my offer.

31:56.415 --> 31:57.905
Oh, God, I will never
eat fish again.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.702
- Except for lobster pups.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.496
- Why would I eat those?

32:04.714 --> 32:06.670
- Bill's gone to set up
for the wake.

32:06.800 --> 32:10.213
It's too soon,
but it's the McShaw way.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.095
- They seemed pretty angry
with each other last night.

32:14.224 --> 32:15.805
- I didn't kill him.

32:15.934 --> 32:16.798
Neither did Bill.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.220
We were together all night.

32:20.021 --> 32:22.683
Do you know why I'm staining
this piece instead of Bill?

32:22.816 --> 32:24.397
Because the restaurant
never leaves him

32:24.526 --> 32:25.936
any time for himself.

32:26.069 --> 32:28.401
I've been hoping,
somehow,

32:28.530 --> 32:30.066
he'd find a way
to get free,

32:30.198 --> 32:33.531
and when we go under,
I guess he will be.

32:35.996 --> 32:37.486
Oh, sorry.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.658
That's Bill's
favorite stress food.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.076
He was working here
yesterday.

32:43.837 --> 32:44.997
- Does he have more of these?

32:45.130 --> 32:46.119
- In there.

32:51.178 --> 32:52.509
Oh, what is that?

32:52.637 --> 32:55.379
- The missing piece.

32:59.060 --> 33:02.018
Where are these lobsters from?

33:02.147 --> 33:03.136
- Hidden Cove.

33:03.273 --> 33:06.731
I'm making some lobster salad
for the wake.

33:06.860 --> 33:08.225
Geoff never liked
my recipe,

33:08.361 --> 33:11.068
thought it was pedestrian.

33:13.867 --> 33:15.323
- Take a bite of it.

33:16.745 --> 33:17.860
Please.

33:34.971 --> 33:36.302
- What's this
supposed to prove?

33:36.431 --> 33:38.547
- Just—just take
one more bite,

33:38.683 --> 33:39.672
and I'm gone.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.231
You killed your brother.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.400
You hated him.

33:51.530 --> 33:52.565
- What? No.

33:52.697 --> 33:53.686
- You killed him.
Just admit it!

33:53.823 --> 33:55.359
- No, I didn't.
- No, just admit it.

33:55.492 --> 33:56.857
- Agent Parker—
- No, I didn't!

33:56.993 --> 33:58.324
- You hated being stuck here.
- Are you kidding me?

33:58.453 --> 33:59.488
- So you killed him!

33:59.621 --> 34:00.781
- He was my brother,
and I wouldn't hurt him!

34:13.385 --> 34:14.465
- When you get upset,

34:14.594 --> 34:17.085
what you eat
turns out like that.

34:17.222 --> 34:20.430
You ate the same salmon
Geoff did.

34:25.438 --> 34:26.723
- Oh, God, Geoff...

34:26.856 --> 34:28.232
died 'cause of me.

34:37.742 --> 34:40.575
- Geoff‘s autopsy results
are in.

34:40.704 --> 34:43.821
There was no salmon
in his stomach,

34:43.957 --> 34:46.448
just some kind of pastry.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.541
- You mean I didn't kill him?

34:48.670 --> 34:50.331
- They're ruling it
an accident.

34:50.463 --> 34:53.955
He fell into the water
and drowned.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.798
He was in anaphylactic shock,

34:55.927 --> 34:58.964
some massive allergic reaction
to sesame oil.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.555
- But Geoff...

35:02.684 --> 35:04.925
never ate anything
without knowing what was in it.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.268
- Maybe it wasn't an accident.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.566
How you holding up,
Katarina?

35:17.699 --> 35:19.530
- I feel lost without him.

35:19.659 --> 35:20.819
- Yeah, I'm sure you do.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.863
You two were close,
weren't you?

35:22.996 --> 35:24.156
- Yeah.

35:24.289 --> 35:27.247
I thought we were
going places together.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.991
- Instead you're gonna be
going to prison alone.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.119
That's kind of sad.

35:32.255 --> 35:33.415
- What?

35:33.548 --> 35:34.833
I don't understand.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.422
- Sure, you do.

35:36.551 --> 35:39.167
You knew that Geoff
was allergic to sesame oil.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.670
So you drizzled some
on a pastry,

35:41.806 --> 35:43.091
and the pecans
hid the flavor.

35:43.224 --> 35:45.089
- No, l—
- So what?

35:45.226 --> 35:46.477
He came over.

35:46.603 --> 35:48.309
You talked him
into tasting some.

35:48.438 --> 35:49.848
- You can't prove
any of this.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.142
- She doesn't have to
if you confess.

35:53.318 --> 35:54.854
- You know
what the funny thing is?

35:54.986 --> 35:58.103
Is that we thought Bill
killed Geoff for a while.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.650
But then we realized
it had to be you.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.701
- You grew up here,
Katarina.

36:08.833 --> 36:11.085
So did I.

36:11.211 --> 36:13.623
You've heard stories
about the troubles.

36:14.673 --> 36:17.710
- [chuckling]
Those are just stories.

36:19.636 --> 36:21.251
- Are they?

36:23.932 --> 36:25.263
- You know why the food
kept going bad?

36:25.392 --> 36:26.302
It was Bill.

36:26.434 --> 36:28.641
He was so angry
about things here,

36:28.770 --> 36:30.635
when he ate,
it poisoned the food.

36:36.736 --> 36:38.476
- You people are crazy.

36:38.613 --> 36:39.728
- You think so?

36:39.864 --> 36:41.570
Then you won't mind
if Bill

36:41.700 --> 36:43.406
finishes the sandwich
you were eating.

36:43.535 --> 36:46.242
- Don't worry about it.
He hasn't killed anybody yet.

36:46.371 --> 36:47.702
- Except some pigeons.

36:47.831 --> 36:49.571
- And the cows, but, I mean,
that was an accident.

36:49.708 --> 36:50.697
- Makes you wonder
what would happen

36:50.834 --> 36:52.074
if he was trying.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.880
- Stop, okay?
Just stop it!

37:04.222 --> 37:05.587
He wasn't supposed to die.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.090
After everything
I did for him,

37:08.226 --> 37:09.432
he was just
gonna leave me here

37:09.561 --> 37:10.926
and go back to Justine.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.268
- You knew he was allergic.

37:12.397 --> 37:15.810
- Yes, but I just wanted
to make him sick.

37:15.942 --> 37:17.728
I thought,
with all the ill people,

37:17.861 --> 37:20.273
no one would notice.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.691
I never meant to kill him.

37:24.868 --> 37:28.110
ljust wanted to make him
feel as bad as I did.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.407
I'm sorry.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.662
No one should be able
to do things like that.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.119
- They can't.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.837
That's the thing
about growing up around here.

37:39.966 --> 37:42.298
People actually believe
those tales.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.292
The troubles are just stories

37:44.429 --> 37:46.920
to scare kids
around the campfire.

37:59.778 --> 38:00.938
- Are you okay?

38:02.572 --> 38:05.439
- Can't have her thinking
Haven's full of freaks, can we?

38:07.702 --> 38:09.283
- Are those Geoff‘s
personal effects?

38:09.412 --> 38:11.323
- Bill should have them
now that we're done.

38:11.456 --> 38:12.536
- Yeah.

38:20.006 --> 38:21.871
Yeah.

38:22.008 --> 38:24.545
Yeah, he should.

38:28.765 --> 38:32.132
- I cannot believe
he was going to stay.

38:32.268 --> 38:33.974
- Yeah, he went back
for the knife.

38:34.103 --> 38:37.391
I guess he wasn't done
giving second chances.

38:38.691 --> 38:39.897
- Hey.

38:40.026 --> 38:41.106
- You really think
this'll work?

38:41.236 --> 38:43.522
- Yeah.
I think it might.

38:43.655 --> 38:47.022
- I'm sorry about Geoff.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.023
- Thanks for coming.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.775
- What's up, bro?

38:52.497 --> 38:54.613
- Same deal.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.205
This time, I set the price.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.541
- All right, I'll buy.

38:58.670 --> 38:59.625
How much?

38:59.754 --> 39:01.164
- 20.

39:01.297 --> 39:03.037
- That's it?

39:15.728 --> 39:17.059
- The Second Chance?

39:17.188 --> 39:19.600
- I don't want to run it
without Geoff.

39:19.732 --> 39:21.233
Brings me nothing but anger.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.145
And, like I talked about
with Agent Parker,

39:23.278 --> 39:25.690
stress doesn't agree
with my digestion.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.904
- I can't take
your restaurant, Bill.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.534
- Ah, go on, Duke.

39:30.660 --> 39:32.651
That's as close to keeping it
in the family as I can get.

39:32.787 --> 39:35.278
You're the only
second chancer left.

39:41.462 --> 39:42.542
- I don't know
what to say.

39:44.340 --> 39:45.750
- Hey, you know the rules.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.420
There's no refunds.

39:47.552 --> 39:50.214
Besides, you could use
a legitimate business.

39:53.308 --> 39:54.514
- When you put it that way.

40:02.150 --> 40:03.435
- You really think
I can make a living

40:03.568 --> 40:04.432
at this woodworking?

40:04.569 --> 40:07.060
- Honestly, I don't care.

40:07.196 --> 40:09.778
I'm just glad
to have my husband back.

40:26.049 --> 40:28.540
- So what do you think?

40:32.263 --> 40:33.503
- It's a start.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.926
- [chuckles]

40:36.059 --> 40:38.266
Oh, that's high praise
from a Wuornos.

40:39.729 --> 40:42.015
- Saw your car
parked on the street.

40:42.148 --> 40:43.649
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.311
- And?

40:45.443 --> 40:47.229
- You took up three spaces.

40:47.362 --> 40:48.317
- So?

40:48.446 --> 40:50.027
- It's gonna take time.

40:50.156 --> 40:52.147
- Yeah.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.524
[chuckling]
Yeah, it is.

40:55.912 --> 40:57.072
You know,
I was thinking

40:57.205 --> 40:59.742
about how there are
two different Havens.

40:59.874 --> 41:02.160
There's the one that's
right beneath the surface,

41:02.293 --> 41:05.330
and then there's the one
right underneath that.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.294
- Sounds like every town.

41:07.423 --> 41:10.335
- It's definitely
not like every town.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.959
But you, Nathan,
you live in both Havens,

41:13.096 --> 41:16.259
and I think that we're gonna
find that very useful.

41:17.684 --> 41:19.675
- Might be.

41:24.649 --> 41:25.684
- This is one of those times

41:25.817 --> 41:27.853
where you need to say
absolutely nothing.

41:28.861 --> 41:30.442
- Okay.

41:31.823 --> 41:36.032
- [laughing]
