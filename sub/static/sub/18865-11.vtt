00:01.268 --> 00:03.335
(Birds chirp, cars rumble)

00:05.639 --> 00:08.040
- Alexis, I just got an email
from your school.

00:08.075 --> 00:09.641
- Okay, in my defense,

00:09.676 --> 00:11.276
I did not know he was
a substitute teacher,

00:11.311 --> 00:13.045
and basically,
nothing happened.

00:13.080 --> 00:14.379
- Okay, well, that's not it,

00:14.414 --> 00:16.682
and please don't go down
that path again.

00:16.717 --> 00:19.918
Apparently there's a lice
outbreak in your class.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.954
- Oh my God!
- Ewww!

00:21.989 --> 00:24.189
Ugh, it's probably Kelsey,

00:24.224 --> 00:25.891
she's such a horse girl.

00:25.926 --> 00:28.126
- Honestly Alexis, if you don't
like the way somebody looks--

00:28.161 --> 00:29.862
- Dad, that's so mean!

00:29.897 --> 00:31.196
She doesn't look like a horse,

00:31.231 --> 00:32.698
she just talks about them a lot.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.132
And smells a bit.

00:34.167 --> 00:35.968
- (Gasps) You know,
you keep scratching.

00:36.003 --> 00:38.003
- Ewww!

00:38.038 --> 00:40.973
- No, I'm just allergic
to the down pillow.

00:41.008 --> 00:43.375
- No, no, you probably
have lice.

00:43.410 --> 00:46.712
You're scratching
because you have lice!

00:46.747 --> 00:49.948
- Wait a minute, we were in all
the rooms changing the sheets!

00:49.983 --> 00:52.251
- Okay, how-can lice jump?

00:53.553 --> 00:55.153
Because if I was sleeping
in my bed,

00:55.188 --> 00:57.289
could a lice jump
from her bed to my bed?

00:57.324 --> 00:59.057
- Can everyone stop saying
lice please?!

00:59.092 --> 01:01.326
- Now I've gotta go back and
change all the sheets again.

01:01.361 --> 01:03.795
- Okay, how do I know that
she didn't give me her lice?

01:03.830 --> 01:05.130
- David, you don't have lice.

01:05.165 --> 01:06.832
- Nobody here has lice!

01:06.867 --> 01:08.533
- No, no, you do!

01:08.568 --> 01:10.168
You-you have the lice!

01:10.203 --> 01:11.870
- Ah!
- Ughhh!

01:11.905 --> 01:13.305
- Oh! Aah!

01:13.340 --> 01:14.673
- Alexis, you've gotta go
to the store

01:14.708 --> 01:17.376
and get something to deal
with that now!

01:17.411 --> 01:19.878
Okay, I've gotta go back
and change all the sheets.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.847
- Oh! This is the last time

01:21.882 --> 01:23.415
I take a pity selfie
with Kelsey!

01:23.450 --> 01:24.850
- Get away from me!
- Aah!

(Cart rattles)

01:35.495 --> 01:37.996
- (Knocking) Housekeeping.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.464
- Hello!
- Oh, hi.

01:39.499 --> 01:41.867
Uh, just here for
the complimentary...

01:41.902 --> 01:43.335
sheet change.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.404
- But the bed's
already made up.

01:45.439 --> 01:48.240
- Yes, yes, well some
of our guests prefer

01:48.275 --> 01:50.876
morning and evening sheets.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.678
Uh, these are a little heavier,

01:52.713 --> 01:54.346
for sleeping, right?

01:54.381 --> 01:56.281
So if you don't mind,
I'll just get to it.

01:56.316 --> 01:58.016
- I think we're good, I mean,

01:58.051 --> 02:00.018
we haven't even touched
the sheets.

02:00.053 --> 02:01.653
- Oh, good, good, good!

02:01.688 --> 02:03.455
- Why is that good?

02:03.490 --> 02:06.024
- Well, it just means
you're having a busy day,

02:06.059 --> 02:07.526
you know, up and at 'em.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.860
- Oh.
- Right.

02:08.895 --> 02:10.228
- (Laughs) Right.

02:10.263 --> 02:11.730
And your hair's in a ponytail,

02:11.765 --> 02:12.998
that's fantastic.

02:13.033 --> 02:15.133
- Yeah...

02:15.168 --> 02:17.469
- And by that I mean
it's very hot outside,

02:17.504 --> 02:20.906
and gives the neck
a chance to breathe,

02:20.941 --> 02:22.574
um... yeah.

02:22.609 --> 02:24.142
So...

02:24.177 --> 02:26.478
- We're actually just
on our way out so...

02:26.513 --> 02:28.480
- Oh well, good timing
then, huh?

02:28.515 --> 02:31.183
- So why don't we follow
you out, hmm?

02:31.218 --> 02:34.286
- So that's a yes
to changing the sheets?

02:34.321 --> 02:36.722
- No, no, I think we're good.
Thanks.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.256
- After you.

02:38.291 --> 02:40.759
- Oh, so leaving everything
as is, then.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.060
Couple: Yeah!

02:44.464 --> 02:45.864
(Door creaks shut)

02:47.334 --> 02:49.401
(Bell on door jingles)

02:51.471 --> 02:55.273
- Hi, sorry I'm late,
it's been a busy morning.

02:55.308 --> 02:57.342
(Sighs) How are you?

02:58.812 --> 03:00.712
- I'm fine, thank you.

03:00.747 --> 03:03.181
It's nice to see you.

03:03.216 --> 03:05.550
- Hm! Are you talking to me?

03:05.585 --> 03:08.620
I'm not used to that ah,
level of kindness.

03:08.655 --> 03:10.922
- Yes, we haven't seen
each other in weeks,

03:10.957 --> 03:13.392
so I was just saying
it's nice to see you.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.327
- I'm going to ignore
that passive aggression,

03:15.362 --> 03:17.396
and instead,
lean in to the fact

03:17.431 --> 03:19.431
that we're both working
professionals now,

03:19.466 --> 03:21.566
and Mama Oprah would be
very proud of us.

03:21.601 --> 03:23.535
- Okay, that's one way
to look at it.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.604
- Um, so you know what I think
would be super fun,

03:25.639 --> 03:28.473
if we hung out at your place
tonight.

03:28.508 --> 03:30.208
- My place?
- Mhmm.

03:30.243 --> 03:31.610
- You've never been
to my place.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.545
- Yeah exactly, you were just
saying that we haven't

03:33.580 --> 03:35.013
been spending as much
time together,

03:35.048 --> 03:36.748
and that it's been really
bothering you.

03:36.783 --> 03:39.251
- I don't remember saying
that last part.

03:39.286 --> 03:40.519
- Yeah, so I was just
thinking like,

03:40.554 --> 03:42.387
what about a late night hang,

03:42.422 --> 03:44.623
or like, a platonic sleepover?

03:44.658 --> 03:46.892
- Mm... what's on your head?

03:46.927 --> 03:48.160
- Hm? A hat.

03:49.663 --> 03:52.330
That I'm test driving
for the store.

03:52.365 --> 03:55.133
- I mean, what's happening
under the hat?

03:56.703 --> 03:58.603
The other side.
- Oh, I see.

03:58.638 --> 04:01.106
Yeah um, that would be
a shower cap.

04:02.809 --> 04:05.410
- So this would have nothing
to do with...

04:05.445 --> 04:08.013
the lice outbreak at the motel?

04:09.449 --> 04:11.049
Your dad just called me.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.818
- Mhm, um...

04:12.853 --> 04:15.187
so I might be taking
preventative measures.

04:15.222 --> 04:18.657
I can't afford to have
the store infested with lice.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.258
- I don't think it works
that way,

04:20.293 --> 04:21.726
but just so we're clear,

04:21.761 --> 04:24.830
you were wanting to have
a platonic sleepover

04:24.865 --> 04:27.532
at my place would have nothing
to do with the fact

04:27.567 --> 04:29.501
that your sister has lice?

04:29.536 --> 04:31.837
- Yes, that is almost
entirely correct.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.538
- Oh...

04:33.573 --> 04:36.174
Moira: Good morning!

04:38.145 --> 04:40.278
Bob: Who's gonna be the one
to tell her?

04:40.313 --> 04:41.880
- I'll handle this.

04:41.915 --> 04:44.349
- Have I been let go?
Should I leave?

04:44.384 --> 04:46.218
- No.
- I won't make a scene.

04:46.253 --> 04:48.487
- You still have three
and a half more years.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.655
- But who's counting?

04:50.690 --> 04:54.392
Roland: Moira, I know
that town beautification

04:54.427 --> 04:55.794
is kind of your thing,

04:55.829 --> 04:58.497
so I know you'll wanna know
that um...

04:58.532 --> 05:00.799
we're gonna build
a flower garden.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.667
- And it gets better!

05:02.702 --> 05:04.503
- I imagine it must.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.771
- We're gonna name it
after you.

05:08.441 --> 05:10.275
Oh, and look at that
right there,

05:10.310 --> 05:12.611
utter shock!

05:12.646 --> 05:14.546
- Now, I'm flattered
beyond all reason,

05:14.581 --> 05:16.181
but I can't help but think

05:16.216 --> 05:18.416
the money could be better
spent elsewhere,

05:18.451 --> 05:20.652
making much needed improvements
to the roads,

05:20.687 --> 05:23.388
the streetlamps, the parks,

05:23.423 --> 05:24.756
the sidewalks,
the traffic light--

05:24.791 --> 05:26.958
- Moira, I don't think you
understand how rare it is

05:26.993 --> 05:29.628
for somebody to have something
named for them in this town!

05:29.663 --> 05:31.963
I mean, yeah, the whole town
is named after me,

05:31.998 --> 05:35.400
and Bob over here,
he's got his bench.

05:35.435 --> 05:37.402
- Bob's Bench.

05:37.437 --> 05:39.538
- And Ronnie's got
her rec centre.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.406
- It's an outdoor tennis court,

05:41.441 --> 05:43.708
and last year the net
was stolen.

05:43.743 --> 05:45.710
- Well, she's kind of under
selling it there,

05:45.745 --> 05:48.680
the rec centre is a major
hook-up spot for the kids.

05:48.715 --> 05:50.949
- So is the bench.
- Right.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.918
- As much as I would love
to contribute

05:52.953 --> 05:54.853
to the population growth
of this town

05:54.888 --> 05:57.088
by way of teen pregnancies,

05:57.123 --> 05:58.690
I must decline.

05:58.725 --> 06:00.825
- Honey, it's all about legacy!

06:00.860 --> 06:02.727
Your name will forever
be associated

06:02.762 --> 06:04.629
with this town's name!

06:04.664 --> 06:06.765
- I don't think you're helping.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.501
- I truly appreciate
the gesture.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.735
- Well look,
before you say no--

06:10.770 --> 06:12.704
- No.
- Right.

06:12.739 --> 06:15.006
This is a really big deal,
Moira.

06:16.509 --> 06:17.976
For us to be doing
this for you.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.311
Okay.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.314
(Car rumbles)

06:29.089 --> 06:31.723
Ted: Alexis, I didn't think
you were coming in today.

06:31.758 --> 06:34.125
- Oh um, I hadn't planned to,

06:34.160 --> 06:36.461
but it was really bugging me
that your cupboards

06:36.496 --> 06:39.064
were so... disorganized.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.099
- It's Saturday.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.634
- No, I know.

06:42.669 --> 06:44.669
But the other reason is that

06:44.704 --> 06:46.605
I bumped into one
of our clients,

06:46.640 --> 06:49.341
and her dog has lice,

06:49.376 --> 06:52.577
and she's worried that
she now has lice.

06:52.612 --> 06:54.045
- Who was it?

06:54.080 --> 06:55.914
- Umm...

06:55.949 --> 06:58.149
Meredith? Meredith!

06:58.184 --> 07:00.485
She's new-ish, you might not
remember her,

07:00.520 --> 07:04.556
just kind of like,
mid-length, like wavy hair.

07:04.591 --> 07:08.526
- Does she want me to help her?
- No.

07:08.561 --> 07:10.028
- No, she is too embarrassed.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.497
And I was like... Mere-dith,

07:12.532 --> 07:15.767
Meredith, there's no reason
to be embarrassed,

07:15.802 --> 07:17.402
you're still exceptionally
attractive,

07:17.437 --> 07:19.170
it's just lice,
just get the shampoo,

07:19.205 --> 07:20.605
and deal with it!

07:20.640 --> 07:22.974
- Yeah okay um... the thing is,

07:23.009 --> 07:26.044
that you can't actually
get lice from dogs.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.079
It's a different kind of lice.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.681
- Okay, so what should she use?

07:29.716 --> 07:31.483
Should she use the flea stuff,
or--

07:31.518 --> 07:33.818
- Oh no, she's fine to use
the lice shampoo,

07:33.853 --> 07:36.921
but it's really more
about combing them out.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.857
- Ewww!
- On the upside,

07:38.892 --> 07:40.759
you could tell her that...

07:40.794 --> 07:42.227
they're only attracted
to clean scalps,

07:42.262 --> 07:44.663
and she shouldn't be
too embarrassed.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.431
Also, I'm kind of a samurai

07:46.466 --> 07:48.533
when it comes to a metal comb,
so...

07:48.568 --> 07:50.669
- Okay, are you sure,
because she didn't want to um,

07:50.704 --> 07:52.170
she didn't wanna bug you
on a weekend.

07:52.205 --> 07:53.805
- Bug me.
- (Sighs)

07:53.840 --> 07:55.373
- I am sure.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.776
- Okay, I will tell her.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.011
Um, you know that
it's me, right?

08:00.046 --> 08:02.414
- Yeah, caught on pretty quick.
- Okay, thank you.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.049
You're the sweetest
little vet I've ever met.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.617
- I don't know about little,

08:05.652 --> 08:07.218
because I'm benching 225
right now,

08:07.253 --> 08:08.720
so it's not really something
someone little--

08:08.755 --> 08:10.255
- Aaah, Ted!
- Okay, yep.

08:14.894 --> 08:16.328
- (Sighs) Okay,

08:16.363 --> 08:18.396
so if you wouldn't mind sorting
these body milks by size,

08:18.431 --> 08:19.631
that would be great.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.669
- Can you drink these?

08:24.704 --> 08:26.838
- Um, it's liquid moisturizer,

08:26.873 --> 08:29.140
for your body, so no,

08:29.175 --> 08:30.942
you can't drink them.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.012
- Did you ask if you can
drink it, too?

08:34.047 --> 08:37.015
- Okay, it says body milk
on the label!

08:37.050 --> 08:39.084
- You know, I told David
that the label

08:39.119 --> 08:41.052
was gonna be misleading,
but he insisted.

08:41.087 --> 08:42.587
What was it you said?

08:42.622 --> 08:44.789
"Anyone with a fiber
of common sense

08:44.824 --> 08:46.858
would know that it's not
actually milk."

08:46.893 --> 08:48.927
- What do we think
body milk is,

08:48.962 --> 08:52.530
if not milk for your body?!

08:52.565 --> 08:54.299
- Exactly.
- Stevie, right?

08:54.334 --> 08:56.301
- Yeah.
- I'm Patrick.

08:56.336 --> 08:57.802
I've heard a lot about you.

08:57.837 --> 08:59.204
- None of it is true.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.605
- Oh well, anyone with
a fiber of common sense

09:00.640 --> 09:01.973
would know that.

09:02.008 --> 09:03.975
- I like him.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.543
I like you.

09:05.578 --> 09:07.245
- Okay, is this how
this is gonna go?

09:07.280 --> 09:09.013
Because we have way too much
work to do today

09:09.048 --> 09:10.882
for me to feel attacked by way

09:10.917 --> 09:12.984
of an imbalanced
social dynamic.

09:13.019 --> 09:15.053
- Are-are you wearing
a shower cap?!

09:15.088 --> 09:17.122
- Alexis has lice,

09:17.157 --> 09:19.257
and I am taking preventative
measures.

09:19.292 --> 09:22.026
- By wearing one of our hats
that we now can't sell.

09:22.061 --> 09:24.262
- Oh, he doesn't have it,
I checked his head.

09:24.297 --> 09:27.098
I think the shower cap
is more of a fashion choice

09:27.133 --> 09:29.334
at this point.
- Uh huh.

09:29.369 --> 09:32.070
But you're living with somebody
who does have lice,

09:32.105 --> 09:33.438
so just 'cause you don't
have it now,

09:33.473 --> 09:34.973
doesn't mean that you couldn't
get it tonight,

09:35.008 --> 09:36.975
or tomorrow, or whenever.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.843
- It's almost as if you want me
to get the lice.

09:38.878 --> 09:40.211
- I don't want you to get it,

09:40.246 --> 09:41.713
I just, I think you should
be careful.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.883
You can crash at my place
tonight if you need to.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.384
- Thank you.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.787
But Stevie offered
her place this morning.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.155
- Oh.
- So...

09:50.190 --> 09:51.623
- Can I crash at your place?

09:51.658 --> 09:53.224
- (Laughs)

09:53.259 --> 09:54.926
- This is really fun for me.

09:54.961 --> 09:56.461
I'm having a lot of fun.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.739
- I never thought I'd see
the day, John.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.475
You've been domesticated
beyond recognition.

10:10.510 --> 10:13.511
- Moira, it's been a bit
of a day here.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.079
- Well, this might lift
your spirits,

10:15.114 --> 10:16.481
I just came from council,

10:16.516 --> 10:19.017
and they want to name
a garden after me.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.019
- A garden?

10:21.054 --> 10:22.954
Oh, that's flattering.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.291
Another feather in your cap,
huh?

10:26.326 --> 10:28.526
- Oh, I have enough legacies
as it is, John.

10:28.561 --> 10:31.062
I've got that playhouse theatre
in Pasadena,

10:31.097 --> 10:32.997
My titular scholarship
with Phoenix,

10:33.032 --> 10:35.133
David and Alexis.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.368
- Yeah, but still,
a garden is nice.

10:37.403 --> 10:40.104
You'd have to think twice
about turning that down.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.940
- Oh, I've already
turned it down.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.442
- Oh.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.744
Okay.

10:46.779 --> 10:48.279
Well, it's just...

10:50.650 --> 10:53.551
about a month ago I heard from
the Lucy Albion Studio Theatre

10:53.586 --> 10:55.053
in Pasadena.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.654
- I don't know what that is.

10:56.689 --> 10:59.357
- It used to be called
the Moira Rose--

10:59.392 --> 11:01.559
- No, no! Don't say it!

11:02.896 --> 11:04.395
They've stripped
the playhouse of my name?

11:04.430 --> 11:06.397
Who the fuck is Lucy Albion?!

11:06.432 --> 11:08.900
- A volunteer usher
who died last year.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.071
- And when were you planning
on telling me this, John?!

11:13.106 --> 11:15.240
- Well Moira, it's not like
you have overreacted

11:15.275 --> 11:16.941
to bad news in the past.

11:16.976 --> 11:19.611
I just thought it might sit
better with you

11:19.646 --> 11:21.546
once you'd heard
about the garden.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.317
- No, I just told you
about the garden.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.019
- Uh-huh.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.156
- John, did you ask
Roland and Bob

11:32.191 --> 11:34.192
to name a garden after me?

11:34.227 --> 11:36.394
- No, no!

11:36.429 --> 11:39.297
They wanted to name the garden
after you, Moira.

11:39.332 --> 11:42.367
After I offered to pay
for the plaque,

11:42.402 --> 11:44.536
and a good chunk of the upkeep.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.104
- I don't believe this.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.540
- Sweetheart, I just thought
having your own garden in town

11:48.575 --> 11:51.109
would make losing the theatre
less painful!

11:51.144 --> 11:52.744
- Oh, I won't be pitied, John!

11:52.779 --> 11:55.113
Or fed your pacifying pablum
like some kind of...

11:55.148 --> 11:57.181
soft-headed infant!

11:57.216 --> 11:58.516
- Well, I thought it was
a nice gesture.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.385
- Oh no, no, now I just
wonder what else

12:00.420 --> 12:01.886
you're keeping from me.

12:01.921 --> 12:03.154
- Nothing!

12:04.591 --> 12:06.558
Well, Alexis has lice.

12:06.593 --> 12:07.859
- What?!

12:07.894 --> 12:09.193
Ewwww!

12:09.228 --> 12:10.595
Ewwwww!

12:10.630 --> 12:12.430
I assume you shaved her head!

12:12.465 --> 12:13.898
And we have to put
a wig on her.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.233
But not one of my wigs!

12:15.268 --> 12:17.268
These have to be boxed now!

12:17.303 --> 12:19.504
- Moira, I've got it
all taken care of.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.706
And I'd think twice
about that garden.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.708
- Oh, it's too late,
the notion of that garden

12:23.743 --> 12:26.544
is as abhorrent to me
as our daughter's scalp!

12:26.579 --> 12:28.880
- And I was worried about
you overreacting.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.481
- (Screams)

12:33.720 --> 12:35.119
- Oh...

12:36.589 --> 12:38.489
- What are you doing in here?

12:38.524 --> 12:40.391
- Well, you said to change
the sheets.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.460
- No, we said not to change
the sheets.

12:42.495 --> 12:45.296
- Oh, you said not to change
the sheets!

12:45.331 --> 12:49.067
I could've sworn I heard you
say change the sheets.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.802
Well, while I'm here,
I may as well--

12:50.837 --> 12:53.338
- Please, just leave the bed.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.607
- Sure.
- What's going on?

12:55.642 --> 12:57.408
- What's going on?

12:57.443 --> 12:59.911
Well, my- okay.

12:59.946 --> 13:03.681
My daughter and I were setting
up the room earlier,

13:03.716 --> 13:05.850
and it turns out she has lice.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.621
I was changing the sheets
because you know,

13:09.656 --> 13:11.923
I didn't wanna take a chance.
- Been there.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.192
- Yeah, our six year old
daughter had lice last year.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.727
How old's yours?

13:15.762 --> 13:17.762
- 28.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.264
- Oh, and I checked your
hairbrush and it is fine.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.667
- You checked my hairbrush?!

13:22.702 --> 13:25.570
- It's a complimentary service.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.507
Ted: Why didn't you just
tell me that you had lice?

13:29.542 --> 13:31.609
- Ted, a bug literally fell
out of my head,

13:31.644 --> 13:33.511
onto my textbook this morning.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.513
It was so disgusting.

13:35.548 --> 13:36.814
Plus I didn't want you
to picture me

13:36.849 --> 13:39.317
like some well-toned bug woman.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.586
- Well, I've seen worse.

13:41.621 --> 13:43.254
Fleas, ticks, worms.

13:44.857 --> 13:47.692
Granted, all of those
were on house pets.

13:47.727 --> 13:49.894
- Ted!
- I'm just saying,

13:49.929 --> 13:52.530
that you know,
it could've been worse.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.365
I could be shearing you
with trimmers right now.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.536
- You're really good at this.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.605
It reminds me of when
I was in Bangkok.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.507
There was this amazing
little Resto-Lounge

14:02.542 --> 14:04.509
that specialized
in Tahitian food,

14:04.544 --> 14:06.577
and scalp massages.

14:06.612 --> 14:08.513
- I'm not sure what's
more disgusting,

14:08.548 --> 14:10.448
what I'm doing right now,

14:10.483 --> 14:12.417
or the concept for
that restaurant.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.318
- It was a Resto-Lounge.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.987
- Speaking of Thailand,

14:16.022 --> 14:17.955
I think is probably the most
intimate thing

14:17.990 --> 14:20.558
I've ever done
with an employee.

14:20.593 --> 14:23.027
- Speaking of Thailand,

14:23.062 --> 14:24.629
I think we've done a few more
intimate things than this.

14:24.664 --> 14:27.565
- I meant while they were
an employee.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.435
Not that I'd do this
for anyone else.

14:30.470 --> 14:31.936
- Well, thank you.

14:31.971 --> 14:33.905
- Because it's actually
pretty gross.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.573
- You said it wasn't that bad.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.575
- Well, there are some
big ones in here.

14:37.610 --> 14:40.111
- Ewww!
- I'm joking, I'm joking.

14:40.146 --> 14:41.512
Oh, maybe not.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.780
- Eww!
- Nope, it's fine.

14:42.815 --> 14:44.682
It is fine, it's fine.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.884
Just-just the mama, we got her.

14:48.354 --> 14:49.787
(Knocking)

14:52.024 --> 14:54.959
- Hi, I can't thank you
enough for inviting me.

14:54.994 --> 14:57.562
- Really you should be thanking
yourself for that.

14:57.597 --> 14:58.963
- (Gasps)

14:58.998 --> 15:00.898
This is a lot nicer
than I expected.

15:00.933 --> 15:02.834
For some reason I pictured you
living underground.

15:02.869 --> 15:04.569
- In like, a bomb shelter?

15:04.604 --> 15:05.903
- Yeah like, bomb shelter
aspects.

15:05.938 --> 15:07.705
Look at what you've done
to this place!

15:07.740 --> 15:09.507
look at all this stuff!

15:09.542 --> 15:12.677
Look at that frame on the wall
that you put there.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.779
Look at that Sarah McLachlan
poster!

15:14.814 --> 15:16.481
- Don't be dissing
Sarah McLachlan.

15:16.516 --> 15:17.815
- Who's dissing
Sarah McLachlan?

15:17.850 --> 15:19.584
I followed Lilith Fair
for two summers.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.953
(Sighs)
- So--

15:21.988 --> 15:23.454
- Uh-oh!

15:24.891 --> 15:27.325
Two toothbrushes? Hello!

15:27.360 --> 15:29.827
- No, you see, this is exactly
why I shouldn'tve let you

15:29.862 --> 15:32.964
bully me into allowing you
to stay here!

15:32.999 --> 15:34.699
- Do you require
two toothbrushes?

15:34.734 --> 15:37.201
- Yes, I do.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.873
- Ahhh...

15:44.110 --> 15:46.811
- So maybe I was seeing
somebody a while ago,

15:46.846 --> 15:50.181
and forgot to throw out
his toothbrush.

15:50.216 --> 15:51.783
- I don't recall you
ever telling me

15:51.818 --> 15:53.851
about that chapter
of your life.

15:53.886 --> 15:55.253
- Well, I'm sure
I would've told you,

15:55.288 --> 15:58.089
if you weren't so busy
with the store.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.924
- I'm sorry, is that a soft,

15:59.959 --> 16:02.493
yet affirmative indication
that you miss me?

16:02.528 --> 16:04.896
- No, it is not.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.798
- Because I agree,
our social predicament

16:06.833 --> 16:08.666
is not ideal,

16:08.701 --> 16:11.736
but we are both thriving
professionally,

16:11.771 --> 16:13.571
and I feel like that
needs to be celebrated.

16:15.174 --> 16:17.608
Speaking of,
where are the drinks?

16:17.643 --> 16:19.877
In this thing?
- The fridge.

16:19.912 --> 16:22.013
- Is this- okay.
- Just--

16:23.382 --> 16:25.716
- Okay, I just see two
de-shelled hard-boiled eggs

16:25.751 --> 16:27.585
in a bag, should I be
scared for you?

16:27.620 --> 16:28.986
- The vodka's in the freezer.

16:29.021 --> 16:31.055
- Oh, in the freezer, okay.

16:31.090 --> 16:32.590
(Gasps) There she is!

16:34.093 --> 16:36.227
Look at that, look at her, go.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.130
What a gift.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.300
(Music plays softly)

16:43.870 --> 16:45.970
- Moira!
- Oh, hi.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.405
- I just wanted to say
congratulations

16:47.440 --> 16:49.106
about the garden.

16:49.141 --> 16:51.242
- Oh well, you're very kind,
but I've declined the offer.

16:51.277 --> 16:53.244
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

16:53.279 --> 16:54.846
As much as I love
the spotlight,

16:54.881 --> 16:56.881
sometimes it's best
to just step aside.

16:56.916 --> 16:58.616
- That's surprising.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.551
I know when they told me that
they were gonna put my name

17:00.586 --> 17:03.020
on the new low-impact play
centre at the school,

17:03.055 --> 17:05.089
I was thrilled!

17:05.124 --> 17:06.757
- Yes, it can be very exciting

17:06.792 --> 17:09.727
when the tribute matches
the contribution.

17:09.762 --> 17:12.296
My name graced a theatre,

17:12.331 --> 17:15.233
a country club ladies'
locker room,

17:15.268 --> 17:16.667
a roadway.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.669
- A whole road?

17:18.704 --> 17:20.137
- Oh, not just any road.

17:20.172 --> 17:22.306
This was a lifesaving road,

17:22.341 --> 17:24.976
dedicated to emergency vehicles.

17:25.011 --> 17:27.378
- Like a fire route?

17:27.413 --> 17:31.682
- Technically it was referred
to as Evacuation Route 14,

17:31.717 --> 17:34.418
but those of us in the know
affectionately called it...

17:34.453 --> 17:36.988
"Moira Rose Boulevard."

17:37.023 --> 17:38.723
- You know, Moira,

17:38.758 --> 17:40.858
having your name on a small,
local garden

17:40.893 --> 17:42.293
wouldn't take away from

17:42.328 --> 17:44.996
any of those other amazing
achievements.

17:45.031 --> 17:46.430
- You might think,

17:46.465 --> 17:48.332
but this little particular
little tribute

17:48.367 --> 17:51.102
was bought by my husband,

17:51.137 --> 17:54.338
in an attempt to assuage
my ego!

17:54.373 --> 17:58.409
- And that would be different
from the other times because...

17:59.745 --> 18:02.179
- Well, I mean, of course
philanthropy

18:02.214 --> 18:04.749
and recognition always
go hand in hand, but...

18:04.784 --> 18:06.183
- Listen.

18:06.218 --> 18:07.752
I know this isn't
what you wanted,

18:07.787 --> 18:10.021
but I think it would make
Johnny really happy

18:10.056 --> 18:12.089
to make you happy.

18:12.124 --> 18:14.191
I mean, take Roland.

18:14.226 --> 18:16.494
Every year he buys me
coconut macaroons,

18:16.529 --> 18:18.029
and I just don't have
the heart to tell him

18:18.064 --> 18:20.398
I am really allergic
to coconut.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.301
Yeah, every Valentine's Day
I just rash right up.

18:23.336 --> 18:24.568
(Laughs)

18:24.603 --> 18:26.737
Last year my throat
almost completely shut.

18:28.140 --> 18:29.573
(Crickets chirp)

18:33.479 --> 18:36.013
- I shouldn'tve eaten
those eggs.

18:36.048 --> 18:37.915
- I can't believe I'm trapped
under a blanket with you

18:37.950 --> 18:39.784
knowing you ate those eggs.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.919
- (Sighs)

18:41.954 --> 18:44.322
- I bet Patrick's fridge
is fully stocked.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.790
- What does that mean?!

18:45.825 --> 18:48.359
- It means he's got
his life together.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.962
He's a pretty eligible
bachelor.

18:50.997 --> 18:52.897
Patrick.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.598
- I suppose.

18:58.204 --> 19:00.371
What? He's my business partner.

19:00.406 --> 19:02.606
- Oh, aren't they all.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.475
- What are you doing?

19:04.510 --> 19:08.212
- What, you guys just seem
to really get along well.

19:08.247 --> 19:10.448
- Yeah, because we're
in business together,

19:10.483 --> 19:12.950
and compliment each other
professionally.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.520
- Hm, but he offered for you
to stay over at his place.

19:16.555 --> 19:19.256
- Yes, because unlike
you and I,

19:19.291 --> 19:21.325
he's extremely generous,

19:21.360 --> 19:24.228
and has absolutely
no ulterior motive.

19:24.263 --> 19:26.263
- Then why are you here
and not there?

19:26.298 --> 19:28.199
- Because you asked me first.

19:28.234 --> 19:30.067
- I didn't, though.

19:30.102 --> 19:31.602
- And it would be weird.

19:31.637 --> 19:33.804
- Well, if nothing's going on,
why would it be weird?

19:33.839 --> 19:36.307
- Because we're in business
together,

19:36.342 --> 19:39.377
and I don't know what
his preferences are.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.745
- Well, you're not
gonna find out

19:40.780 --> 19:42.546
what his preferences are
on a sleepover with me.

19:42.581 --> 19:44.482
- Well, I wouldn't be sharing
a bed with him,

19:44.517 --> 19:46.384
I'd be in some guest bedroom.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.686
- Guest bedroom, what is he,
Bill Gates?

19:48.721 --> 19:51.455
- Yes, he's Bill Gates.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.225
- I like this for you.

19:54.260 --> 19:55.559
- Like what?
There's nothing to like.

19:55.594 --> 19:57.061
- You seem flustered.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.429
- I'm not flus--

19:58.464 --> 20:00.097
maybe it's the eggs.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.734
Both: Ughh!

20:05.204 --> 20:07.471
- Um, am I reading this right?

20:07.506 --> 20:10.341
- "The Moira's Rose's Garden."

20:10.376 --> 20:12.309
- Okay look, I went back
and forth on the name

20:12.344 --> 20:14.178
a couple of times,
and I may have...

20:14.213 --> 20:16.647
confused the engraver.

20:16.682 --> 20:19.717
- The Moira's Rose's Garden.

20:19.752 --> 20:24.789
So the garden is dedicated
to a rose that Moira owns?

20:26.659 --> 20:28.993
- I don't think that there
are enough apostrophes.

20:29.028 --> 20:31.462
- I don't even see a rose
in the garden.

20:31.497 --> 20:33.264
- Because there aren't
any roses.

20:33.299 --> 20:34.665
- Or are we the Roses?

20:34.700 --> 20:36.333
- Okay, I'm getting roses
for the garden,

20:36.368 --> 20:37.902
I'm-I'm getting roses.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.336
- Oh... okay.

20:39.371 --> 20:41.572
And what are these
numbers for?

20:41.607 --> 20:43.307
- That's mom's birthday, David.

20:43.342 --> 20:44.675
- Those are the last
four digits

20:44.710 --> 20:46.410
of your father's credit card.

20:46.445 --> 20:48.379
- It was a complicated
order form, all right?

20:48.414 --> 20:51.115
There were a lot of fields
to fill in.

20:51.150 --> 20:54.552
- Um, I hope you got
a really good deal on this.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.353
- It's by the letter,
so he paid extra

20:56.388 --> 20:58.222
for those apostrophe "S's."

20:58.257 --> 20:59.623
- Okay, enough, enough.

20:59.658 --> 21:01.926
This is still a very big
honor for your mother.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.227
Is it not?

21:03.262 --> 21:05.129
- Mhm...
- Yes?

21:06.699 --> 21:07.965
- Mhm.

21:09.401 --> 21:11.335
- So when we die,

21:11.370 --> 21:13.170
are we all gonna be buried here?
