WEBVTT

00:01.081 --> 00:01.814
I'll figure it out.

00:01.882 --> 00:03.316
Just do it one more time,
I will figure it out.

00:03.384 --> 00:05.018
It's too complicated for you.

00:05.085 --> 00:06.486
It's not too complicated for me.

00:06.553 --> 00:08.454
He wants to play the
game, let's give him the game.

00:08.522 --> 00:09.022
Okay, fine.

00:09.089 --> 00:09.822
You pick someone this time.

00:09.890 --> 00:10.623
You tell me.

00:10.691 --> 00:11.491
Okay, fine.

00:11.558 --> 00:12.292
Go.

00:13.111 --> 00:17.830
Plug 'em up. Look away.

00:19.198 --> 00:19.965
You good?

00:20.032 --> 00:20.799
Yeah.

00:20.866 --> 00:21.433
Right here.

00:21.500 --> 00:22.334
Okay. (clears throat)

00:23.533 --> 00:25.403
Some people think he's
the best in the game.

00:27.073 --> 00:28.940
Nobody thought the game
would pass him by.

00:29.008 --> 00:31.343
Together, him and his teammates...
Drew Brees.

00:31.410 --> 00:32.143
Thank you!

00:32.211 --> 00:32.911
Nice, easy one.

00:32.979 --> 00:33.979
You got it now, right?

00:34.046 --> 00:34.813
You understand it, right?

00:34.880 --> 00:35.647
No.

00:35.715 --> 00:37.349
You have to under...
That was so simple.

00:37.416 --> 00:39.351
It took me a while to
figure out the game, too.

00:39.418 --> 00:40.986
It took him a while to figure it out.

00:41.053 --> 00:42.487
This thing knows how to do it?

00:42.555 --> 00:43.121
Yeah.

00:43.189 --> 00:44.356
Want me to show you how?

00:44.423 --> 00:45.357
He'll teach you.

00:45.424 --> 00:47.792
Whoa!
The champion has arrived!

00:47.860 --> 00:48.627
What's up?

00:48.694 --> 00:50.528
Will you stop saying
that word, please?

00:50.596 --> 00:54.099
Gentlemen, as your league champion,
it is time to talk draft.

00:54.166 --> 00:56.368
As we all know, the league
champion determines where we

00:56.435 --> 00:57.369
hold the draft.

00:57.436 --> 00:59.371
There's an abandoned video
store near my place, and they

00:59.438 --> 01:00.372
have couches.

01:00.439 --> 01:02.774
No, no, no, Taco, you're
thinking too small.

01:02.842 --> 01:04.009
You know what, guys?

01:04.075 --> 01:07.379
Let's just blow it out
this year... Vegas.

01:07.446 --> 01:08.380
Vegas?

01:08.447 --> 01:09.381
Vegas draft.

01:09.448 --> 01:11.683
We've never done the
traditional Vegas draft.

01:11.751 --> 01:12.550
Blow it out!

01:12.618 --> 01:13.551
I was gonna say that.

01:13.619 --> 01:14.552
You were gonna say what?

01:14.620 --> 01:15.520
It was my idea.

01:15.588 --> 01:16.521
The Vegas was my idea.

01:16.589 --> 01:18.523
We all just heard him say Vegas.

01:18.591 --> 01:19.491
Pete said it.

01:19.558 --> 01:21.493
In the end, it doesn't really
matter whose idea it was...

01:21.560 --> 01:22.360
It was mine.

01:22.428 --> 01:23.395
Well, you can book it.

01:23.462 --> 01:24.496
You can run with it.

01:24.563 --> 01:25.830
I did, I ran with it.

01:25.898 --> 01:27.599
Guys, guys, enough bickering, okay?

01:27.667 --> 01:29.901
Vegas is a great idea for the
draft, and we should really

01:29.969 --> 01:32.370
raise a glass to Pete for
coming up with it.

01:32.438 --> 01:34.173
Oh, it was just an idea, guys, really.

01:34.209 --> 01:36.180
- To Vegas!
- It was my idea!

01:36.300 --> 01:40.927
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:41.047 --> 01:42.080
So, Vegas.

01:42.148 --> 01:43.348
Yeah.

01:43.416 --> 01:44.377
I kind of want to go.

01:45.718 --> 01:49.020
Why? I mean, all we're gonna
do is, you know, get drunk and

01:49.088 --> 01:50.889
maybe go to a strip club.

01:50.956 --> 01:52.050
I want to be in the league.

01:54.427 --> 01:55.527
But you're... you are.

01:55.594 --> 01:57.362
You're... you help me.

01:57.430 --> 02:00.065
You're, like...
almost in the league.

02:00.132 --> 02:02.200
Almost in the league, but I'm
not really in the league.

02:02.268 --> 02:03.802
You'll be on my team with me.

02:03.869 --> 02:06.805
I don't want to be on your team
with you; I want my own team.

02:06.872 --> 02:09.007
Those three out-of-town
dudes never even show up.

02:09.074 --> 02:11.509
I'm here, and I can be there,
and I just, I have all this

02:11.577 --> 02:12.410
knowledge, okay?

02:12.478 --> 02:13.078
Help me, then.

02:13.145 --> 02:14.412
I need to use it.

02:14.480 --> 02:15.413
Give it to me.

02:15.481 --> 02:16.881
It doesn't help you.

02:16.949 --> 02:19.417
You still manage to shoot
yourself in the foot.

02:20.119 --> 02:20.985
Come on.

02:21.053 --> 02:21.920
I can't do it.

02:21.987 --> 02:23.588
Why?
You are the commissioner.

02:23.656 --> 02:24.589
My hands are tied.

02:24.657 --> 02:25.824
It's an eight-team league, it

02:25.891 --> 02:27.425
always has been, it
always will be.

02:27.493 --> 02:31.229
Okay, fine. If one of the eight drops out...
No one drops out.

02:31.349 --> 02:33.657
It's like the Supreme Court.
People just die on the bench.

02:33.909 --> 02:35.692
Supreme Court has 9 judges.

02:36.604 --> 02:39.070
I feared
this day would come.

02:39.138 --> 02:42.440
All those years of free fantasy
advice... here comes the bill.

02:43.476 --> 02:46.244
I love my wife, but I don't
want her in the league.

02:46.312 --> 02:47.445
I mean, this is my thing.

02:47.513 --> 02:49.681
That she does for you, essentially.

02:49.749 --> 02:52.517
I mean, do you realize without
her help how frighteningly bad

02:52.585 --> 02:53.451
you would be?

02:53.519 --> 02:54.452
I wouldn't be that bad.

02:54.520 --> 02:55.553
Oh, my God... Vegas hat!

02:55.621 --> 02:57.122
Oh!

02:57.189 --> 02:58.456
Vegas! Right?

02:58.524 --> 02:59.791
Wow, that's ugly.

02:59.859 --> 03:01.426
Best idea ever.

03:01.494 --> 03:02.727
Very good idea, not Andre.

03:02.795 --> 03:04.262
Right, it was my idea.

03:04.330 --> 03:07.432
Hey, if we do need a ninth,
my brother-in-law Ralphie's

03:07.500 --> 03:08.733
available.

03:08.801 --> 03:09.968
No. No.

03:10.035 --> 03:13.138
Brolo... Bro, no...
He stinks, man.

03:13.205 --> 03:15.106
As league champion, I shoot it down.

03:15.174 --> 03:16.074
Here, happy birthday.

03:16.142 --> 03:17.942
This is a belated gift
from Jenny and I.

03:18.010 --> 03:19.911
Oh, my God, I can't believe
you guys gave me your butt

03:19.979 --> 03:20.879
beads... that's so nice.

03:20.946 --> 03:21.713
Oh, that's beautiful.

03:21.781 --> 03:22.881
Open it up in Vegas. Okay?

03:22.948 --> 03:23.615
Okay.

03:23.682 --> 03:25.083
Oh, this is your plane ticket, Taco.

03:25.151 --> 03:26.951
Thank you for paying for it, brother.

03:27.019 --> 03:29.721
To pay you back, I will teach
Ellie to ride a motorcycle.

03:29.789 --> 03:30.722
That's not necessary.

03:30.790 --> 03:31.790
She's only six.

03:31.857 --> 03:34.225
Okay, now, look, as your league
champion, it's come to my

03:34.293 --> 03:37.495
attention that we need to
determine the order of the draft.

03:37.563 --> 03:38.496
I have already done that.

03:38.564 --> 03:41.240
Please... ladies, follow moi.

03:41.360 --> 03:43.835
Very simple: security
line, right over here.

03:43.903 --> 03:46.504
First person through the
security line gets the first

03:46.572 --> 03:47.839
pick in the draft. Huh?

03:47.907 --> 03:50.975
Wait, wait, you son of a bitch...
you checked all your bags.

03:51.043 --> 03:53.211
That's because I'm
in it to win it.

03:53.279 --> 03:54.479
Go!

03:56.000 --> 04:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:07.159 --> 04:08.026
Kevin!

04:08.093 --> 04:09.961
I'm a doctor, and there's
a medical emergency.

04:10.029 --> 04:10.929
I need to get on a flight.

04:10.996 --> 04:14.499
I don't believe you, and a
doctor wouldn't wear that hat.

04:14.567 --> 04:18.503
Cactus. Be careful. It's...
All these colors don't go together.

04:18.571 --> 04:20.038
It was designed by Santana.

04:20.105 --> 04:21.272
Pardon me, pardon me!

04:21.339 --> 04:23.641
Look out!

04:26.579 --> 04:27.779
Goddamn slip-ons!

04:27.847 --> 04:28.913
It's a joke bomb!

04:28.981 --> 04:29.848
It's a joke bomb!

04:29.915 --> 04:32.283
Sir, don't use the word
"bomb" in this airport.

04:32.351 --> 04:33.618
It's a classic Kevin joke.

04:33.686 --> 04:35.053
Excuse me for one second.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.856
No, no, no. No. Hey!

04:37.923 --> 04:39.023
No, no, no!

04:39.091 --> 04:41.125
Oh... sack!

04:41.193 --> 04:43.228
Number one pick! Whoo!

04:43.295 --> 04:45.763
You can body-cavity search me
all you want... all you're gonna

04:45.831 --> 04:48.606
find is Tennessee running
back Chris Johnson!

04:48.726 --> 04:50.747
Whoo! Suck it.

05:00.391 --> 05:01.615
Smells like Vegas.

05:01.683 --> 05:03.217
So, it's, like, a word scramble?

05:03.284 --> 05:04.218
No, that's not it.

05:04.285 --> 05:05.853
Oh, I hate this game.

05:05.920 --> 05:08.088
Don't hate the game,
hate the player, buddy.

05:08.156 --> 05:08.922
I'm the player.

05:08.990 --> 05:10.624
I know.

05:10.692 --> 05:13.193
Dudes, check it out, all right?

05:13.261 --> 05:14.595
We are living the life.

05:14.663 --> 05:16.630
This weekend is going to be amazing.

05:16.698 --> 05:20.551
But I have one rule: what happens
in Vegas stays in Vegas.

05:20.814 --> 05:22.897
- No, it does not.
- What do you mean, no, it doesn't?

05:23.017 --> 05:24.863
- It's a rule.
- I don't subscribe to that rule.

05:24.983 --> 05:26.440
Okay, so you're gonna do nothing...
that the people at

05:26.508 --> 05:28.752
home wouldn't want to hear about?

05:28.872 --> 05:31.111
Nope. Oh, and by the way, the
term "What happens in Vegas,"

05:31.179 --> 05:34.014
that should be, like, buried
in a graveyard of overused

05:34.082 --> 05:36.617
expressions along with "You go,
girl" and "Show me the money."

05:36.685 --> 05:38.619
Come on, homie don't play that.

05:38.687 --> 05:39.420
Really?

05:39.487 --> 05:41.622
Come on, let's just go
check out the suite.

05:41.690 --> 05:42.389
It's so money.

05:42.457 --> 05:43.223
Vegas, baby!

05:43.291 --> 05:45.025
Gentlemen...
Shit.

05:45.093 --> 05:46.226
...meet Las Vegas.

05:46.294 --> 05:49.196
It's Spanish for
"Andre is awesome."

05:49.264 --> 05:50.030
Wow!

05:50.098 --> 05:51.677
Well done, Andre, well done.

05:51.797 --> 05:52.679
Yeah.

05:52.799 --> 05:55.202
I got to admit, this is...
kind of great.

05:55.270 --> 05:57.638
Well, you ain't seen nothin'
yet.

05:57.706 --> 06:00.641
Gentlemen...
welcome to Las Vegas.

06:01.810 --> 06:02.643
What?!

06:02.711 --> 06:04.778
Chad Ochocinco.

06:04.846 --> 06:06.380
In the flesh.

06:06.448 --> 06:07.715
Hey, come on up, man.

06:07.782 --> 06:08.649
What?!

06:08.717 --> 06:11.652
Chad's gonna be our special
guest... you know, our master of

06:11.720 --> 06:12.386
ceremonies.

06:12.454 --> 06:13.320
How are you here?

06:13.388 --> 06:15.656
What... I don't...
Chad and I are getting into

06:15.724 --> 06:16.924
the calf implant business.

06:16.991 --> 06:20.127
I'm making molds of his
calves in two sizes.

06:20.195 --> 06:22.963
Preseason...
and Playoff Push, baby.

06:23.031 --> 06:24.431
Why are you working with him?

06:24.499 --> 06:25.399
Yeah.

06:25.467 --> 06:27.668
Child, please!
I won... No. Stop.

06:27.736 --> 06:28.736
Don't do that.

06:28.803 --> 06:29.803
What do you mean?

06:29.871 --> 06:30.771
Don't do that.

06:30.839 --> 06:32.806
'Cause you didn't even
use it in the right way.

06:32.874 --> 06:34.842
But can I still use it professionally?

06:34.909 --> 06:35.843
Dude, you're a doctor.

06:35.910 --> 06:38.846
I know, but, you know, when a
woman comes in and she's, like,

06:38.913 --> 06:41.415
"I want a face lift," I'm,
like, "Child, please!"

06:41.483 --> 06:42.149
No.

06:42.217 --> 06:42.816
No?

06:42.884 --> 06:43.917
No, it doesn't even go.

06:43.985 --> 06:46.286
I think you need to come up with
something more... Andre-ish.

06:46.354 --> 06:50.455
"Try the veal... child."

06:50.575 --> 06:51.358
What was that one?

06:51.426 --> 06:52.426
Try the veal, child.

06:52.494 --> 06:53.460
Try the veal.

06:53.528 --> 06:54.862
I use J-Date!

06:54.929 --> 06:56.964
I don't...
I'm not even Jewish.

06:57.031 --> 06:58.332
I cry myself to sleep.

06:58.399 --> 07:00.134
I'm an adult virgin.

07:01.536 --> 07:04.285
Not... not even true.

07:04.405 --> 07:06.089
Do you have any draft advice for me?

07:06.209 --> 07:08.563
- I'll draft you first if you give me
some good advice. - Hey...

07:09.106 --> 07:10.578
- If you draft me first...
- Uh-huh.

07:10.698 --> 07:11.712
...you won't need any advice.

07:11.780 --> 07:12.980
Yeah. Try the veal, man.

07:13.047 --> 07:14.281
Can you shut up?

07:14.349 --> 07:15.716
What? I'm trying.

07:15.784 --> 07:18.719
Ochocinco...
He's a totally normal guy.

07:18.787 --> 07:20.788
Does he have his own room?

07:20.855 --> 07:23.857
Wha... Wha...
uh... Huh?

07:23.925 --> 07:24.725
You didn't!

07:24.793 --> 07:25.492
What?!

07:25.560 --> 07:27.127
Oh, you asshole!

07:27.195 --> 07:28.944
What have you done to Shiva?

07:29.183 --> 07:30.497
Oh, it's not the Shiva anymore.

07:30.565 --> 07:32.533
It's "The Dre."

07:32.600 --> 07:34.535
Why are you dressed like a ballerina?

07:34.602 --> 07:36.904
I'm not dressed like a
ballerina; I'm dressed like a

07:36.971 --> 07:38.138
weightlifter.

07:38.206 --> 07:39.347
Why are you dressed
like a weightlifter?

07:39.467 --> 07:41.522
That is heresy.

07:41.642 --> 07:44.128
You made a god in your
own image, Andre.

07:44.248 --> 07:44.919
You're doomed.

07:45.063 --> 07:46.538
I'm not doomed.

07:46.658 --> 07:48.000
- It's the Shiva.
- It's the Dre.

07:48.029 --> 07:49.566
- It's the Shiva.
- It's the Dre.

07:49.593 --> 07:50.714
No, it is the Shiva!

07:50.853 --> 07:53.878
Guys, guys, guys, we can reach
a compromise here, okay?

07:54.174 --> 07:57.564
- Let's call it the She-Dre.
- She-Dre.

07:57.608 --> 07:58.773
Well, no, wait, that's his name.

07:59.096 --> 08:01.765
So we'll call him She-Dre...
her, we'll call her She-Dre.

08:01.877 --> 08:05.455
No, call me Andre or
Winner or League Champion.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.090
Hey, She-Dre, is there
any beer in here?

08:07.566 --> 08:08.591
I don't care what you guys say.

08:08.711 --> 08:10.289
I'm a winner, I'm a champion.

08:10.409 --> 08:13.763
Respect me and respect the Dre.

08:22.072 --> 08:24.907
All right, this is just a pit
stop because I have reservations

08:25.027 --> 08:26.557
at this molecular gastronomy
place that is supposed to be off

08:26.677 --> 08:28.561
- off the hook.
- Oh, my God.

08:28.681 --> 08:29.866
We're not going there.

08:29.986 --> 08:31.579
Can you back off with this thing?

08:31.699 --> 08:32.726
What are you doing, a book report?

08:32.846 --> 08:35.659
One word, my friend...
stripper sound ringtones.

08:35.780 --> 08:36.993
That is three words.

08:37.113 --> 08:39.570
You realize you could have
one that's ten times smaller than that.

08:39.690 --> 08:40.971
- Oh, hello, friends.
- Hi.

08:41.091 --> 08:42.936
Look, he's making friends already.

08:43.716 --> 08:45.182
Wow, look at that ass.

08:45.302 --> 08:48.728
See, you guys are not focused
at all on what is at hand here, okay?

08:48.848 --> 08:50.802
The draft is upon us, and I am
the only one focused

08:50.922 --> 08:51.729
with my eyes on the prize.

08:51.849 --> 08:53.491
I'm picking first; I got
nothing to worry about.

08:53.553 --> 08:54.781
You guys...
Yeah.

08:54.849 --> 08:55.749
You guys have to worry.

08:55.817 --> 08:58.374
Do whatever you guys want,
but take it from your league champion:

08:58.494 --> 09:00.627
QBs are all the rage this year.

09:00.747 --> 09:04.041
Philip Rivers has been going in the first
round in all my trainer leagues.

09:04.161 --> 09:06.451
What, trainer leagues? What are you
talking about, "trainer leagues"?

09:06.571 --> 09:07.582
Hey.

09:08.494 --> 09:09.818
Uh, one second, we got a...

09:09.938 --> 09:12.016
If you're such a great champion,
why do you need a trainer league?

09:12.136 --> 09:14.621
You know what? Why do you look like
a background dancer from This Is It?

09:14.640 --> 09:16.296
Philip Rivers... round one.

09:16.416 --> 09:18.495
You draft Philip Rivers in the first round.
Go ahead. You know what?

09:18.615 --> 09:20.807
- You go ahead.
- You guys have got it wrong.

09:21.483 --> 09:24.332
Rivers isn't going before
the third in any of my mock graphs.

09:24.452 --> 09:26.988
What do you know about Rivers and drafts?

09:27.108 --> 09:28.782
I won my league last year.

09:28.850 --> 09:31.755
So what kind of league are you guys in?

09:31.875 --> 09:35.590
Guys in... PPR, IDP,
auction, dynasty?

09:35.710 --> 09:37.924
Eight-man fantasy
football league.

09:38.044 --> 09:39.980
Yeah, losers take the
winner out to dinner.

09:40.100 --> 09:42.456
Why are you such an authority
on fantasy football?

09:42.576 --> 09:43.748
The players come in here.

09:43.868 --> 09:45.727
They tell me
everything they know.

09:45.847 --> 09:47.854
- You serious?
- Mm-hmm.

09:48.135 --> 09:48.838
Wow.

09:48.958 --> 09:50.686
Um, I was actually curious

09:50.720 --> 09:54.284
about the rates for the,
uh, the "champagne room."

09:54.312 --> 09:55.847
I'd be interested in a
little one-on-one time.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.667
We're talking, like,
$300 for a half hour.

09:57.717 --> 09:59.740
Can we just do $200 and you
can keep your clothes on?

09:59.795 --> 10:00.917
I really just need the info.

10:01.037 --> 10:02.271
Well, where's the fun in that?

10:02.607 --> 10:03.940
I'll give you $250, you can

10:04.060 --> 10:05.484
keep your clothes on, and
we'll do four rounds.

10:05.604 --> 10:07.934
Why don't you guys just pool
your money and come in together?

10:08.583 --> 10:10.380
Oh, God, no, that's disgusting.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.658
No, we don't cross streams.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.735
No, I will give you $250.

10:13.855 --> 10:14.661
You can keep a parka on.

10:14.781 --> 10:15.798
It doesn't matter to me.

10:15.918 --> 10:16.732
I don't care what
you're wearing.

10:16.777 --> 10:17.864
I just want some sleepers.

10:17.932 --> 10:20.099
No, no, no, $300.

10:20.219 --> 10:22.606
I just need 15 minutes, three
rounds, but I need three sleepers.

10:22.647 --> 10:23.686
$400 for Kevin.

10:23.852 --> 10:25.051
- What?!
- Yes.

10:25.171 --> 10:25.950
Sold.

10:26.302 --> 10:27.480
You get the first
pick of the draft.

10:27.517 --> 10:28.934
That's the only
advantage you get.

10:33.760 --> 10:34.988
I have a really good feeling

10:35.108 --> 10:37.004
about Felix Jones in the
second round this year.

10:37.050 --> 10:39.841
- I think he's poised for a huge
breakout season... - Felix Jones?

10:39.887 --> 10:40.577
No?

10:40.625 --> 10:42.889
Why go with Felix Jones in
the second when you can have

10:42.957 --> 10:45.061
Ricky Williams in the ninth?

10:45.181 --> 10:47.946
End of the year, their stats are
still going to be the same.

10:48.582 --> 10:52.335
That is very good advice,
Ambrosia, very good advice.

10:52.574 --> 10:56.012
No, no, no, I-I don't need... I have
a couple more rounds to get through here.

10:56.132 --> 10:57.732
Let's keep moving.

11:03.351 --> 11:07.932
Gentlemen, welcome to the Helm's
Deep of the 2010 Fantasy Draft.

11:08.052 --> 11:09.047
Wow, wow.
Nice.

11:09.114 --> 11:11.525
Look around, take it in.
It's all here.

11:11.645 --> 11:12.939
- How are you?
- Nice to see you.

11:13.059 --> 11:15.114
Beautiful women, free beer.

11:15.234 --> 11:19.408
This is what you get when your
league champion is also a winner at life.

11:19.528 --> 11:22.795
You know, gentlemen, I'd like
you all to prepare for the year

11:22.915 --> 11:24.024
of the Andre-nation.

11:24.294 --> 11:26.323
What?
What did you say?

11:26.443 --> 11:28.158
- The domi-Dre-tion.
- Really?

11:28.278 --> 11:29.140
That was a quick one.

11:29.260 --> 11:31.267
Hey.

11:31.815 --> 11:33.069
- What's up?
- What's up, Ocho?

11:33.136 --> 11:34.953
What's good? Are we ready
to get this thing started?

11:35.073 --> 11:36.181
Is everybody here, first off?

11:36.301 --> 11:38.398
The two out-of-town idiots are
on auto-draft, but I haven't

11:38.518 --> 11:40.445
seen Vince all... He's supposed
to be coming, right? I mean...

11:40.512 --> 11:42.447
Oh, that's right, I spoke to Vince.

11:42.514 --> 11:44.482
He's not going to make it to
Vegas, and he's actually

11:44.550 --> 11:45.450
out of the league.

11:45.831 --> 11:47.480
What? Now you tell us?

11:47.600 --> 11:48.186
Wow.

11:48.253 --> 11:49.921
I just found out, like, a month ago.

11:49.988 --> 11:51.018
Oh, you're a dick.

11:51.138 --> 11:53.322
An eight-team league is
already weak as it is.

11:53.442 --> 11:55.475
- Y'all call me when y'all
figure it out, all right? - You got it.

11:55.595 --> 11:56.741
- All right, Chad.
- Hey, quick question.

11:56.861 --> 11:58.103
Do these look cool?

11:58.497 --> 11:59.810
Child, please.

12:01.564 --> 12:03.919
He "child, pleased" me,
he "child, pleased" me.

12:04.039 --> 12:05.503
Jesus Christ, Ruxin, why
didn't you say anything?

12:05.571 --> 12:06.604
What is wrong with you?

12:06.672 --> 12:08.525
Don't get your panties in a bunch.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.174
You guys need a problem solver.

12:10.242 --> 12:11.175
C'est moi.

12:11.243 --> 12:13.644
I will solve your
problems, all right?

12:13.712 --> 12:15.780
That's why I have invited
Raffi to join the league.

12:15.848 --> 12:16.881
Brolo?

12:16.949 --> 12:17.882
No, no, no, no.

12:17.950 --> 12:18.883
First off, he's terrible.

12:18.951 --> 12:20.396
Secondly, he's in Chicago.

12:20.516 --> 12:23.484
No, actually I had him

12:24.890 --> 12:26.491
You suck...

12:26.558 --> 12:27.258
Oh, boy.

12:27.326 --> 12:29.364
Raffi bomb.

12:29.484 --> 12:31.512
What's up, guys? Andre.

12:31.632 --> 12:32.845
I can see his penis beard.

12:32.965 --> 12:33.675
How's it going, guys?

12:33.795 --> 12:36.510
I'm so excited to
belong to something.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.588
Well, it's not
definite yet, right?

12:38.708 --> 12:40.638
Yeah, we haven't...
He said it's definite, he said it's on.

12:40.706 --> 12:43.007
All right, let's get this
thing started, right?

12:43.075 --> 12:44.008
What is this?

12:44.128 --> 12:45.400
It's the draft board, Raffi.

12:45.429 --> 12:47.512
You know behind this
there are girls, right?

12:47.772 --> 12:49.514
Are you kidding me?
Has it come to this?

12:49.581 --> 12:51.261
Is this our only option?

12:51.381 --> 12:53.093
I don't know, guys, you might
have one more option.

12:53.213 --> 12:54.202
Whoa.

12:54.322 --> 12:55.666
Babe, what the hell
are you doing here?

12:55.786 --> 12:57.785
Aw, I missed you, too, babe.
Good to see you.

12:57.905 --> 12:59.475
I was talking to Vince's
wife on the phone.

12:59.595 --> 13:00.359
She said Vince was out.

13:00.479 --> 13:01.743
I thought you guys
might need an eighth.

13:01.995 --> 13:04.476
Um, I guess we...
We got our eighth, we got Raffi.

13:04.596 --> 13:05.263
Well, not really, not yet.

13:05.330 --> 13:06.998
I don't know, guys, I think

13:07.065 --> 13:09.100
that this might, might
actually need a vote.

13:09.168 --> 13:10.316
Yes, a vote, please.

13:10.365 --> 13:11.836
Okay, yeah, no, I want a vote.

13:11.904 --> 13:12.975
What are we voting for?

13:13.095 --> 13:14.266
You don't get a vote, Raffi.

13:14.386 --> 13:17.041
- Why not? I'm in the league.
- This is humiliating.

13:17.109 --> 13:17.974
No, come on.

13:18.094 --> 13:21.100
Yeah, me sitting here next
to you wait... humiliating.

13:21.220 --> 13:22.575
Want to make out, past the time?

13:22.695 --> 13:23.351
No.

13:23.375 --> 13:24.666
- No?
- No, I don't.

13:24.786 --> 13:26.187
Okay, sorry.
I've got to ask.

13:26.307 --> 13:27.738
It's a numbers game, you know?

13:28.554 --> 13:30.221
- Hey.
- Thank you.

13:30.289 --> 13:33.558
Um, so we talked about it and
we've come to a decision and,

13:33.625 --> 13:37.097
uh, congratulations, Raffi.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.663
Yeah, whoo!

13:38.730 --> 13:40.665
In your face!
Geez.

13:40.732 --> 13:41.499
I'm so sorry.

13:41.567 --> 13:42.667
Are you kidding me?!

13:42.734 --> 13:44.802
You picked him?!

13:46.267 --> 13:47.505
Unbelievable.

13:47.573 --> 13:48.739
Don't be mad.

13:48.807 --> 13:49.740
Is she single?

13:49.808 --> 13:51.175
What's her story?

13:51.243 --> 13:52.510
That's my wife.

13:52.578 --> 13:55.187
Wow, is it working out?

13:55.307 --> 13:57.980
And it's official... Raffi
is part of our league.

13:58.100 --> 13:58.963
All right.

13:59.083 --> 14:00.210
Here we go.
Let's do it.

14:00.330 --> 14:02.337
Hey, can we please get
this draft started?

14:02.457 --> 14:03.853
Yes, let's do it.
Let's rock, let's get it.

14:03.973 --> 14:05.948
I want to know: who
didn't vote for me?

14:06.068 --> 14:07.730
It's a secret vote.
Can't discuss the details.

14:07.850 --> 14:09.260
Wow, I would have
voted for you.

14:09.380 --> 14:10.628
There's already one
woman in this league.

14:10.696 --> 14:11.729
Ain't that right, She-Dre?

14:12.798 --> 14:13.712
You, too, really?

14:13.832 --> 14:15.101
I'm paying for your room, man.

14:15.221 --> 14:17.273
I don't know, guys, I just
think it's really sad that you

14:17.393 --> 14:18.803
are afraid to lose to a girl.

14:18.923 --> 14:21.848
- Babe... - I think you did it
because you're scared of me.

14:21.968 --> 14:23.883
You can still be on my
team, if you want to be.

14:24.003 --> 14:27.467
What I want to do is inflict
as much pain on each and every

14:27.587 --> 14:29.333
one of you as possible.

14:29.453 --> 14:30.355
How are you going to do that?

14:30.475 --> 14:33.723
- Ruxin, do you want some help?
- Are you serious?

14:33.843 --> 14:35.436
Yeah, I'll help you
out with your draft.

14:35.556 --> 14:36.266
It's unfair.

14:36.386 --> 14:38.322
Fortune favors the just!

14:38.360 --> 14:40.386
I like it. Alright, first pick of

14:40.506 --> 14:41.814
the 2010 draft

14:41.934 --> 14:43.995
***, Chris Johnson.

14:44.062 --> 14:45.613
I'm not your sticker bitch.

14:45.733 --> 14:47.598
Good point.

14:47.666 --> 14:49.154
There it is! Huh?

14:49.274 --> 14:53.223
- Taco has traded his number
three pick for Ruxin's... - And Jenny's.

14:53.343 --> 14:54.941
...number six pick in the draft.

14:54.973 --> 14:56.173
What are you getting in return?

14:56.241 --> 14:58.175
Oh, nothing, six is
my lucky number.

14:58.243 --> 15:00.367
Did you want me in the league?

15:01.113 --> 15:02.531
I love you?

15:02.881 --> 15:05.420
I would... let's go get
married all over again.

15:05.540 --> 15:06.547
We're in Vegas.

15:06.667 --> 15:10.214
Ruxin, I've got some
awesome sleepers.

15:10.334 --> 15:12.081
- You know my friend Mike?
- Mike?

15:12.201 --> 15:13.204
Mike Ochocinco.

15:13.324 --> 15:14.565
Same last name... maybe
you guys are related.

15:14.685 --> 15:15.660
- Nah.
- No?

15:15.727 --> 15:18.187
It's just not so often you
meet a guy with the exact same

15:18.307 --> 15:19.597
Spanish numerals as a last name.

15:19.717 --> 15:20.908
Raffi, it's your pick.

15:21.028 --> 15:23.612
Fine, whatever, blah,
blah, blah, this guy.

15:24.005 --> 15:25.286
- All right?
- All right.

15:25.406 --> 15:26.622
- A kicker?
- A kicker.

15:26.742 --> 15:27.571
Adam Vinatieri.

15:27.691 --> 15:28.572
I like kickers.

15:28.692 --> 15:31.575
Round three... Aaron Rodgers.

15:31.643 --> 15:32.961
Whoo!

15:36.493 --> 15:38.551
- No, Taco was there first.
- I want Manning.

15:38.597 --> 15:39.397
Okay.

15:42.202 --> 15:44.568
Probably one of the fastest
to ever play the game.

15:44.688 --> 15:46.672
Never played the game
too well at night.

15:46.792 --> 15:48.319
Too many people
underestimated him...

15:48.363 --> 15:50.542
Oh, I got it, I got it...
DeAngelo Williams.

15:50.662 --> 15:51.773
How did, how did...?

15:51.893 --> 15:52.934
Oh, how do you do this?

15:53.054 --> 15:54.198
Rux, it's so easy, baby.

15:54.318 --> 15:55.349
Want me to explain it to you?

15:55.469 --> 15:57.230
I hate this game!

15:57.350 --> 15:58.423
Child, please.

15:58.543 --> 16:01.771
Dre, no, we just talked
about using that.

16:01.891 --> 16:02.973
I know, I thought I
could say it a little.

16:03.041 --> 16:05.009
Jesus Christ, man, I'm
out of here, man.

16:05.129 --> 16:06.849
No, I mean, I'll stop.

16:06.969 --> 16:09.249
Hey, Kevin, you put my
tenth round pick up yet?

16:09.369 --> 16:10.848
- Packers need a middle.
- Boom.

16:10.916 --> 16:12.750
Passing to Taco.

16:12.818 --> 16:14.952
Hey, where did you
guys get the tubes?

16:15.020 --> 16:16.887
Where did you get these tubes?

16:16.955 --> 16:19.271
- Oh, look at this board.
- It's good.

16:19.391 --> 16:21.553
- I mean, look at my lineup.
- I know.

16:21.673 --> 16:25.696
Ohh... I'm sorry, Miles
Austin in the fifth?

16:28.225 --> 16:29.888
Stop roster-bating, please.

16:30.008 --> 16:32.064
You can't just masturbate
to your lineup in public.

16:32.184 --> 16:34.085
Kevin, you're just jealous
'cause you took a big shit in

16:34.205 --> 16:35.482
the pool and put it
up on the board.

16:35.602 --> 16:37.819
Are you allowed to take
a shit in the pool?

16:42.687 --> 16:43.381
Whoo!

16:43.448 --> 16:44.715
Oh, God.

16:44.783 --> 16:50.554
Gentlemen, table service
provided by the Dre.

16:50.622 --> 16:52.441
Why doesn't it have a penis?

16:52.561 --> 16:55.199
Oh, because it's anatomically
correct, Taco.

16:55.252 --> 16:57.068
It has a penis, I mean...

16:57.188 --> 16:58.848
Yeah, here it is.

16:58.968 --> 17:01.430
Look, it's a little penis.
Touch it.

17:01.550 --> 17:03.041
Whoa.
Hi.

17:03.161 --> 17:04.598
That is...
Wow.

17:04.719 --> 17:05.869
My wife is hotter
than her and her.

17:05.936 --> 17:06.904
My wife's hotter than her.

17:06.972 --> 17:08.762
My wife's hotter than her.

17:08.882 --> 17:10.011
Okay, we get it!

17:10.131 --> 17:11.779
You out-kicked your
coverage with Sofia.

17:11.898 --> 17:14.167
Ah, but you know who the
prettiest lady at the party is?

17:14.288 --> 17:15.192
My lineup!

17:15.311 --> 17:15.894
Really?

17:16.013 --> 17:17.999
Oh, my God, you wrote
your lineup on a napkin.

17:18.118 --> 17:19.784
You wouldn't let me
bring the board.

17:19.851 --> 17:20.684
Look at this.

17:20.752 --> 17:21.652
It is nice, though.

17:23.688 --> 17:26.339
All right, enough with the
roster-batory fantasies, okay?

17:26.459 --> 17:27.258
Do that in private.

17:35.577 --> 17:37.376
Oh, nothing, just hanging out
with Chad, talking football.

17:39.419 --> 17:40.895

disgusting individuals who

actually has more fun with
his wife... I don't get it.
