WEBVTT

00:05.100 --> 00:06.446
Everybody dies.

00:06.861 --> 00:08.105
That's just the way it is.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.990
I'm told I'm not supposed
to argue or question

00:12.073 --> 00:14.161
or even try to understand.

00:14.796 --> 00:16.579
I'm told a lot these days.

00:17.131 --> 00:20.183
Ever since my life was
snuffed out by a toilet seat

00:20.234 --> 00:22.712
and I joined the ranks of the undead.

00:22.958 --> 00:25.068
You, little dead girl,
are gonna be a grim reaper.

00:25.703 --> 00:27.494
My name is George Lass.

00:28.328 --> 00:29.717
I take souls for a living.

00:30.867 --> 00:32.003
This is Rube.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.239
He's undead too.

00:33.879 --> 00:37.125
He's the one who gets the list,
who's to die, when and where,

00:37.319 --> 00:40.103
which he passes on to the
rest of us grim reapers.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.859
- E.T.D. ?
- Estimated Time of Death.

00:43.899 --> 00:46.009
Do you guys get off
dropping pianos on people ?

00:46.091 --> 00:48.676
It's not our job to drop the
pianos or the toilet seats.

00:48.911 --> 00:51.245
- Whose job is it ?
- Gravelings.

00:53.207 --> 00:55.020
Reapers don't get a free ride.

00:55.454 --> 00:56.376
What are you doing ?

00:56.514 --> 00:57.543
Collecting my salary.

00:57.620 --> 01:00.811
We don't get paid like
through proper channels.

01:00.871 --> 01:04.933
- Hi, I'm Dolores Herbig as in...
- Her big brown eyes.

01:05.013 --> 01:09.397
What kind of universe would give me the
power to extract souls from people's bodies

01:09.474 --> 01:12.945
but still force me to keep a
suck-ass job if I wanna eat.

01:14.235 --> 01:15.357
This was my home.

01:15.745 --> 01:17.122
And this was my family.

01:17.677 --> 01:19.130
They're having trouble copping.

01:19.533 --> 01:21.536
Keeping a dead animal in your toy box.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.515
It's something a crazy person would do.

01:23.811 --> 01:24.865
I'm not crazy.

01:25.489 --> 01:27.659
I was having trouble copping too.

01:28.012 --> 01:30.097
I don't think I'm
supposed to be doing this.

01:30.615 --> 01:31.600
You're learning.

01:31.641 --> 01:33.471
You gotta think about all
the things you like and

01:33.528 --> 01:35.468
decide if they're worth
sticking around for.

01:36.713 --> 01:37.808
And if they are...

01:37.971 --> 01:39.344
you'll find a way to do this.

01:39.743 --> 01:40.704
What if I don't ?

01:41.254 --> 01:42.240
Then you go away.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074

02:52.182 --> 02:53.173
When I was alive,

02:53.308 --> 02:56.274
I never looked at the
obituaries, like, not even once.

02:57.163 --> 02:58.735
Now I read them first.

02:58.966 --> 03:00.692
The reaper's sport pages.

03:01.113 --> 03:03.738
And every time I see
someone who lived to even 50,

03:04.014 --> 03:05.315
it kind of annoys me.

03:06.918 --> 03:08.490
Was your name ever in the paper ?

03:09.503 --> 03:10.495
Constantly.

03:10.932 --> 03:12.188
I still have all the clipping.

03:12.226 --> 03:14.524
I made the police reports
a couple of times, you know,

03:14.552 --> 03:18.315
unidentified male slender built seen
fleeing the premises, that kind of things.

03:18.592 --> 03:19.733
That doesn't count.

03:20.045 --> 03:21.659
What about you, sweetie ?

03:22.432 --> 03:23.432
Do tell.

03:23.946 --> 03:26.670
Teen killed by falling
debris from space station.

03:27.418 --> 03:30.178
Technically, that was
the day after your life.

03:30.280 --> 03:34.365
My demise went unreported. Drug related
deaths in the 60s were very common.

03:35.432 --> 03:36.454
I've gotta go wee-wee.

03:40.306 --> 03:41.504
Was your death reported ?

03:41.653 --> 03:44.980
Oh please ! I perished in a huge
fire in the set of Gone with the Wind.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.284
Not a word, huh ?

03:46.378 --> 03:47.964
Nothing. The story was buried.

03:48.681 --> 03:50.505
- And three days later...
- So were you.

03:50.541 --> 03:52.819
But my picture was in the
paper a whole lot before I died.

03:52.820 --> 03:53.498
Why ?

03:53.499 --> 03:56.504
On the arm of whatever famous
man I was sleeping with.

03:57.694 --> 03:59.096
Right. Not my thing.

03:59.650 --> 04:01.380
- You never slept with anybody ?
- No.

04:01.902 --> 04:02.824
Why didn't you ?

04:03.012 --> 04:06.357
Well, Daisy, first of
all, I was 18 years old.

04:06.608 --> 04:08.835
- Not a good excuse.
- I never had a boyfriend.

04:09.111 --> 04:11.000
- Not really a problem.
- I lived at home

04:11.127 --> 04:12.882
with my parents and my little sister.

04:13.073 --> 04:14.608
Never heard of a car ?

04:16.095 --> 04:17.764
Is it just my imagination or

04:17.969 --> 04:20.743
have I become much more attractive
since I've laid of the booze

04:20.793 --> 04:22.172
and, you know, whatnot.

04:22.366 --> 04:23.369
Your breath is better.

04:23.626 --> 04:24.910
Your eyes are less puffy.

04:25.060 --> 04:27.747
You don't have as much
drool around your mouth

04:27.840 --> 04:28.776
which is nice.

04:28.777 --> 04:31.946
Yet the most attractive thing about
when you were drinking and whatnot

04:32.002 --> 04:34.752
is that you really had no
idea if you were attractive.

04:34.926 --> 04:36.776
Because when people
know they're attractive,

04:36.958 --> 04:37.870
they're not.

04:37.916 --> 04:40.245
And it's not about
what's on the outside.

04:40.445 --> 04:44.398
It's not about this, it's
about this. It's about here.

04:45.532 --> 04:48.523
Then he's a very handsome man.

04:52.847 --> 04:53.902
But am I pretty ?

04:53.944 --> 04:55.842
Oh you're a darling, you
make my heart flutter.

04:55.917 --> 04:56.912
Mine too.

04:57.014 --> 04:58.364
- Really ?
- No.

04:58.668 --> 05:00.470
There are souls to be taken, folks.

05:00.532 --> 05:02.094
This morning before breakfast.

05:02.247 --> 05:03.171
One, two.

05:03.625 --> 05:04.582
Three.

05:05.974 --> 05:07.112
Four, five.

05:07.628 --> 05:08.877
Why do I only get one ?

05:09.133 --> 05:10.782
Because three doesn't
add to five evenly.

05:11.289 --> 05:12.257
What does Roxy get ?

05:12.584 --> 05:13.529
Huh, usually...

05:14.258 --> 05:15.957
Eggs. Side of fruit.

05:16.103 --> 05:18.227
I was thinking hash browns today.

05:18.708 --> 05:19.681
Nice.

05:19.988 --> 05:23.444
These are all at the farmer's
market in exactly 27 minutes.

05:23.515 --> 05:24.590
I smell a disaster.

05:25.568 --> 05:27.689
No, 5 deaths is not a disaster.

05:27.822 --> 05:29.418
How many deaths is a disaster ?

05:29.633 --> 05:31.251
More than five. Five is bullshit.

05:31.369 --> 05:34.007
- How many ?
- 16 to 20: disaster.

05:34.381 --> 05:36.362
21 and up: catastrophe.

05:36.464 --> 05:38.405
8 to 15, it's a calamity.

05:38.477 --> 05:40.161
- 7 and under ?
- That's a crying shame.

05:40.361 --> 05:42.291
Pick me up some tomatoes
while you're up there.

05:42.413 --> 05:43.323
Sure.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.281
- See you later.
- Goodbye.

05:50.994 --> 05:53.729
- Anything in the paper ?
- Two heart attacks and a stroke.

05:55.066 --> 05:56.000
Nice.

05:57.461 --> 06:00.758
Trying to find your reap is kinda
like a game of hide and go seek.

06:01.005 --> 06:02.428
Except that when I find you,

06:02.663 --> 06:05.311
when I put the tag on
you, you're out for good.

06:05.879 --> 06:07.978
Ready or not, you're dead.

06:09.894 --> 06:13.953
Okay, enough with the game. I haven't
had breakfast and momma wants a waffle.

06:14.296 --> 06:16.309
Come out ! Come out ! Wherever you are.

06:17.450 --> 06:19.022
Oh we have a winner.

06:19.320 --> 06:20.272
Thanks boys !

06:21.085 --> 06:22.139
This has been a treat.

06:25.474 --> 06:27.275
I'm done. Two of the hard hats get it.

06:27.604 --> 06:28.588
Wanna get a lattÃ© ?

06:29.088 --> 06:31.895
No, you gotta go. I've
got something to do.

06:33.865 --> 06:35.458
It's been two hours now, guys.

06:35.540 --> 06:36.952
I still smell propane.

06:37.316 --> 06:38.766
This is killing my business.

06:42.519 --> 06:44.029
I'm usually swamped by nine.

06:44.428 --> 06:46.711
Today, you're tow up by ten.

06:47.153 --> 06:49.620
You think Eliza Doolittle had
to put up with this nonsense ?

06:49.804 --> 06:51.627
- Who ?
- Audrey Hepburn, sweetheart.

06:51.842 --> 06:54.321
Look at me. Still
waiting for Rex Harrison.

06:54.357 --> 06:55.681
Don't hold your fucking breath.

06:55.758 --> 06:58.151
You see this is who I sell flowers to.

06:58.329 --> 07:03.398
Men who need to apologize for
the things they say to women.

07:03.633 --> 07:05.604
And who end up paying
for it one way or another.

07:10.582 --> 07:11.501
Pink lilies.

07:14.282 --> 07:15.204
On the house.

07:15.773 --> 07:17.344
My first customer of the day.

07:18.446 --> 07:21.277
Oh great! She can see the
guilt written all over me.

07:22.440 --> 07:23.459
Mine too.

07:31.476 --> 07:32.464
I couldn't find it.

07:32.504 --> 07:34.753
Geez ! You people can find Pearl
Harbour in the middle of the night

07:34.830 --> 07:36.299
but you can't find a gas link!

07:36.780 --> 07:38.481
I'm Chinese, cocksucker !

07:45.039 --> 07:47.573
Gravelings... fucking troublemakers.

08:03.097 --> 08:04.337
Bodies everywhere.

08:06.830 --> 08:08.673
And a dead flower girl in the middle.

08:10.449 --> 08:12.462
It was like a really fucked up wedding.

08:15.524 --> 08:17.166
She gave me a pretty flower.

08:17.684 --> 08:18.770
And what did I give her ?

08:19.502 --> 08:20.457
Nothing.

08:20.716 --> 08:21.771
I took her soul.

08:22.590 --> 08:24.985
I don't know why but I felt
like I had betrayed her.

08:26.040 --> 08:26.993
Somehow.

08:32.784 --> 08:35.666
The last time I had seen a
death like this was my own.

08:36.982 --> 08:39.448
And I wanted to run
away as fast as I could.

08:45.072 --> 08:46.017
Order up !

08:48.842 --> 08:51.057
You know what's best about being sober ?

08:52.430 --> 08:54.493
Not waking up in a
pool of your own vomit ?

08:54.892 --> 08:55.917
Definitely that, yeah.

08:56.372 --> 08:57.908
But no, it's the taste of food.

08:59.888 --> 09:01.503
I mean, after all these years,

09:01.569 --> 09:04.319
I've finally realized
why you guys eat here.

09:04.456 --> 09:06.049
In da fucking Waffle House.

09:06.714 --> 09:07.755
This is a wise move.

09:08.769 --> 09:11.041
Bacchus has drown many
more men than Neptune.

09:11.558 --> 09:12.500
Bacchus ?

09:13.198 --> 09:15.593
He's the Greek god of "why
don't you read a fucking book?"

09:16.156 --> 09:18.461
When did you die ?
Nineteen sixty something ?

09:18.942 --> 09:19.960
66.

09:20.519 --> 09:25.459
Taking every nasty ass drug you could
get your nasty ass pause on for 40 years.

09:25.536 --> 09:26.524
Yeah.

09:26.525 --> 09:27.825
Oh no, no, not everything.

09:27.871 --> 09:29.488
'Cause I was definitely
afraid of needles.

09:29.537 --> 09:30.759
And I still am.

09:30.969 --> 09:33.569
They've made great strides
in the design of needles.

09:34.358 --> 09:35.281
They're sharper.

09:35.398 --> 09:37.806
- Sharper ?
- Sharper is less painful.

09:39.924 --> 09:41.552
Are you gonna finish those hash browns ?

09:41.992 --> 09:42.930
Probably not.

09:46.478 --> 09:48.148
Fucking bloody hell !

09:49.125 --> 09:50.044
I'm outta here.

09:52.294 --> 09:53.272
Did you see that ?

09:54.450 --> 09:56.656
I mean because I wanted
some of her hash browns...

09:57.681 --> 09:58.555
I was there.

09:58.556 --> 10:01.013
I have never seen such violence
over such small potatoes.

10:01.494 --> 10:02.667
Well, that was almost clever.

10:02.796 --> 10:03.994
What was almost clever, Rube ?

10:04.081 --> 10:05.899
Thinking hash browns are small potatoes.

10:06.426 --> 10:07.368
I don't get it.

10:07.726 --> 10:09.631
Because hash browns are small potatoes.

10:10.029 --> 10:10.945
Never mind.

10:13.610 --> 10:14.949
- Daisy.
- Roxy.

10:15.217 --> 10:16.737
This weather kinda suits you.

10:17.136 --> 10:19.021
You know, Roxy, I really
don't think it does.

10:19.830 --> 10:20.854
Off to work you go.

10:22.646 --> 10:24.065
Why do I even bother with you ?

10:24.461 --> 10:27.224
Because I'm one of the
few fools who gets you.

10:27.480 --> 10:29.476
Really ? What do you get ?

10:29.834 --> 10:31.999
When I go to the pound to pick up a dog,

10:32.169 --> 10:34.089
I don't take the one that wags his tail

10:34.172 --> 10:36.582
and licks my face and jumps all over me.

10:36.793 --> 10:38.118
I pick the one in the corner.

10:38.292 --> 10:40.183
Alone. Shaky.

10:40.767 --> 10:43.214
Well, go on. Get inside
where it's warm. go girl !

10:43.341 --> 10:45.116
- Okay.
- Here you go.

10:45.333 --> 10:46.833
Daisy Adair...

10:47.780 --> 10:48.779
Chihuahua.

10:50.034 --> 10:53.654
Hello ! Is anyone here ?

10:55.978 --> 10:56.943
Reggie ?

11:02.128 --> 11:02.900
You know...

11:02.901 --> 11:04.139
when someone calls your name,

11:04.340 --> 11:07.119
you could say "Hi! I'm
here ! What's up mom ?"

11:07.631 --> 11:09.971
A simple "What is it ?" would suffice.

11:10.267 --> 11:11.193
What is it ?

11:13.550 --> 11:15.634
This is how you're gonna
spend your school holiday ?

11:16.033 --> 11:16.984
Looks that way.

11:17.232 --> 11:19.633
I just saw Bridget and Annie
heading down to the park.

11:19.663 --> 11:21.033
Why don't you go catch up with them ?

11:21.149 --> 11:22.089
I don't think so.

11:22.234 --> 11:23.452
Give me one good reason.

11:23.637 --> 11:25.594
I don't really like
getting baked before noon.

11:25.818 --> 11:26.768
Baked ?

11:29.004 --> 11:29.950
Oh...

11:31.670 --> 11:35.934
- Reggie, I'm not going to...
- I haven't. I won't.

11:36.087 --> 11:38.577
Did you ever catch your
sister doing stuff ?

11:38.797 --> 11:40.564
No. Did you ?

11:40.778 --> 11:44.020
No. Never. I don't think
your sister smoked pot.

11:44.117 --> 11:45.387
I searched constantly.

11:46.626 --> 11:48.311
All what Georgia ever did was...

11:49.729 --> 11:51.418
pretty much what you're doing right now.

11:52.217 --> 11:53.154
Whatever.

11:53.455 --> 11:54.449
Mom.

11:54.494 --> 11:56.665
Your father and I have
another doctor's appointment.

11:56.723 --> 11:58.207
Stay out of the park.

11:59.262 --> 12:01.935
I better not see any cherry
stains on those cushions.

12:03.815 --> 12:05.223
It's not a real doctor.

12:05.861 --> 12:06.782
It's a shrink.

12:12.996 --> 12:15.390
Rube didn't want me
lurking around my old house.

12:15.717 --> 12:17.495
He didn't want me spying on my family.

12:18.109 --> 12:21.027
He says that a reaper should
be like a soldier in a foxhole.

12:21.708 --> 12:23.101
Lay low, don't be a hero,

12:23.419 --> 12:25.384
don't take any unnecessary risk.

12:25.911 --> 12:29.029
What's the point of keeping your head
down once it's already been blown off ?

12:31.675 --> 12:32.969
How did it go this morning ?

12:33.013 --> 12:35.901
Ah ! Real fun ! Try to get me
another one like that real soon.

12:35.984 --> 12:36.950
How about a breakfast ?

12:37.115 --> 12:40.278
I'll have the Johnny Vegas over
easy and a small grapefruit juice.

12:40.374 --> 12:42.513
You could hear the explosion
all the way over here.

12:42.603 --> 12:44.405
The Johnny Vegas comes with a side.

12:44.492 --> 12:45.609
That was disgusting.

12:45.726 --> 12:49.060
Her body was blown to pieces.

12:49.171 --> 12:52.571
Her brain was... cottage cheese.

12:55.483 --> 12:56.627
Pretty flower.

12:56.960 --> 12:59.028
- Did someone betray you ?
- What ?

12:59.208 --> 13:00.958
Did some guy screw you over ?

13:01.063 --> 13:04.382
I thought we had decided that you
and romantic entanglements were...

13:04.656 --> 13:05.613
It's not a good idea.

13:05.767 --> 13:07.139
And I thought George was a virgin.

13:07.339 --> 13:10.012
What? No! No guy.

13:10.134 --> 13:12.371
And who told you I was a
virgin, did you tell him that ?

13:12.582 --> 13:13.590
- No.
- Yes, she did.

13:13.703 --> 13:15.162
It's just a flower. Fuck !

13:15.879 --> 13:17.984
I only got flowers when
somebody betrayed me.

13:18.177 --> 13:19.401
I didn't betray anyone.

13:19.581 --> 13:20.564
Sure didn't say you did.

13:21.543 --> 13:22.919
It takes like ass.

13:23.052 --> 13:23.982
Try that.

13:24.127 --> 13:27.297
I'm trying to stay off the
ice juice but thank you.

13:27.604 --> 13:30.444
You know who sent beautiful
flowers, French tulips ?

13:30.707 --> 13:33.246
I'll just give you his
initials Douglas Fairbanks Jr.

13:33.696 --> 13:36.512
Errol Flynn, all that
money... Carnations.

13:36.758 --> 13:41.480
Cannot sit here and listen to more
witless stories about star fucking.

13:42.709 --> 13:43.610
You and you.

13:43.927 --> 13:44.881
Let's go.

13:44.899 --> 13:45.865
Rube ! Sorry.

13:45.944 --> 13:47.752
But I've got to finish Roxy's breakfast.

13:48.084 --> 13:50.091
Here. Why don't you take it to go ?

13:50.208 --> 13:52.333
It's a disgusting habit,
eating off someone's plate.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.649
You wanna be an ex-drug addict ?

13:54.694 --> 13:56.410
Why don't you behave like one, huh ?

13:57.237 --> 13:58.984
Crazy fucking fuck !

13:59.318 --> 14:03.138
How I wish the words would roll
out my tongue as they do yours!

14:10.925 --> 14:12.040
Another outdoor death !

14:12.097 --> 14:13.859
My lips are getting so chapped.

14:14.038 --> 14:16.085
Roxy says I look like a dog.

14:16.347 --> 14:17.586
I didn't betray him.

14:17.659 --> 14:20.202
Do I look like some kind of
stray that needs to be saved ?

14:20.263 --> 14:22.634
I'm really pretty, don't you think ?

14:23.686 --> 14:25.296
I need verbal reassurance.

14:25.728 --> 14:26.699
You're not a dog.

14:27.145 --> 14:29.408
- Say the thing.
- You're really pretty.

14:29.500 --> 14:30.647
Say the whole thing !

14:30.995 --> 14:33.791
You're the most exquisite
beauty the world has ever seen.

14:34.614 --> 14:35.553
I gotta go.

14:35.862 --> 14:37.302
What about your breakfast ?

14:37.442 --> 14:38.392
I don't want it.

14:40.954 --> 14:41.942
Forgot your flower.

14:42.555 --> 14:43.535
I don't want it.

14:46.730 --> 14:47.702
I did want it.

14:48.186 --> 14:50.692
I just didn't feel like
carrying around the reminder

14:50.755 --> 14:52.919
of my morning death the rest of my day.

15:00.185 --> 15:01.106
Hi, Crystal!

15:01.571 --> 15:04.566
Which is why it wasn't so
bad walking into Happy Time.

15:04.966 --> 15:08.381
Where the only thing ever written
on a post-it note was stuff like...

15:08.776 --> 15:09.806
"Who farted ?"

15:10.010 --> 15:12.336
and "Ten copies A.S.A.P."

15:12.417 --> 15:14.521
and "Please see me."

15:25.334 --> 15:26.309
Oh Millie !

15:26.681 --> 15:28.359
- Dolores ?
- I got news.

15:29.174 --> 15:33.179
Bad news. I have to
hire my boss' nephew.

15:33.348 --> 15:35.574
I'm sorry, Millie,
but this boy, Brennan,

15:35.625 --> 15:37.516
has had a world of
trouble finding a job.

15:37.643 --> 15:39.275
You're firing me ?

15:39.389 --> 15:41.299
You're shitcanning me just like that ?

15:41.376 --> 15:43.873
No ! Why would you think that ?

15:44.299 --> 15:47.463
Bad news, boss' nephew.

15:48.068 --> 15:49.408
Seemed where you were headed.

15:49.454 --> 15:51.708
I want you to train him, Millie.

15:51.872 --> 15:53.545
And I don't care for the language.

15:53.771 --> 15:55.502
Although I do kind of like that phrase.

15:55.624 --> 15:57.049
Shitcan... Shitcan...

15:57.113 --> 15:59.054
That's the bad news ? I
have to train someone ?

15:59.151 --> 16:01.866
No, the bad news is as
dumb as a bag of hammers.

16:01.943 --> 16:03.970
I'm starting him on reception.

16:04.047 --> 16:05.429
Just show him the phone system.

16:05.516 --> 16:08.424
I'd ask Crystal but
she's not a people person.

16:08.711 --> 16:11.738
No more trainee,
Dolores. I can't take it.

16:12.314 --> 16:13.315
Yeah ?

16:13.442 --> 16:14.408
Hi!

16:14.933 --> 16:16.113
The phone is not working.

16:18.942 --> 16:20.825
Dial 9 first.

16:24.713 --> 16:25.684
I'm Brennan.

16:27.605 --> 16:28.731
I'm training you.

16:28.992 --> 16:30.195
Sweet!

16:35.900 --> 16:36.913
Should I go do it now ?

16:37.625 --> 16:39.299
No time like the present, go.

16:39.497 --> 16:42.965
Oh Millie. I would never shitcan you.

16:43.112 --> 16:44.849
You're very special to me.

16:45.714 --> 16:46.622
Come here.

16:47.237 --> 16:50.260
Can't send you into the world
with schmutz over your face.

16:50.634 --> 16:51.930
Don't go! Stop! Go!

16:52.391 --> 16:54.598
You had to wonder
about Dolores Herbig and

16:55.043 --> 16:56.912
her big strange heart.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.125
You had to wonder about how long
that schmutz has been on my face.

17:01.561 --> 17:03.091
that schmutz or schmÃ¼tz.

17:04.284 --> 17:05.198
So how was your week ?

17:05.248 --> 17:07.336
It was good. I think we had a good week.

17:09.773 --> 17:10.765
Joy ?

17:12.262 --> 17:15.875
Well, I find myself getting
really disgusted when he eats.

17:16.525 --> 17:17.954
I mean physically sick.

17:18.303 --> 17:19.243
That's nice.

17:19.244 --> 17:21.395
I think the walls of his
cheeks have gotten too thin

17:21.477 --> 17:24.381
as he's gotten older because
you're gonna ear the crunching

17:24.508 --> 17:27.119
and the spitting and the swallowing.

17:27.631 --> 17:30.519
I swear to God I'm easing off
salad, I wanna take my own life.

17:30.842 --> 17:33.147
I'm standing in a grocery
store the other day.

17:33.207 --> 17:34.691
And I'm holding a head iceberg lettuce

17:34.743 --> 17:36.945
and I just can't even
buy the fucking thing.

17:37.248 --> 17:38.821
What would you like me to do Joy ?

17:38.870 --> 17:40.671
It'd be nice if you
ate in the kitchen...

17:40.738 --> 17:41.822
with the dog.

17:42.315 --> 17:43.765
At least he's capable of love.

17:44.262 --> 17:45.542
JD doesn't love you.

17:45.849 --> 17:46.888
You give him meat.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.735
- At least one of us is getting it.
- Okay.

17:49.993 --> 17:52.687
I think for this to work

17:52.838 --> 17:55.151
you two need to be a little
less honest with each other.

17:55.224 --> 17:58.316
We actually had that in our vows but
we took that out at the last minute.

17:58.695 --> 18:00.759
You've been married for over 20 years ?

18:01.798 --> 18:02.832
Things have happened

18:02.908 --> 18:04.645
and you know that things have happened.

18:04.706 --> 18:07.624
Like when he started banging someone
in one of his Shakespeare class ?

18:07.648 --> 18:08.458
That kind of thing ?

18:08.459 --> 18:10.968
You know Joy if may be you could
stop wisecracking for 2 seconds.

18:10.988 --> 18:13.788
You hear that ? Wisecracking.
Who talks like that ?

18:13.835 --> 18:16.225
For a marriage to work, you have to

18:16.435 --> 18:18.735
conspire with your partner to

18:18.826 --> 18:20.138
not say everything.

18:20.541 --> 18:23.159
You know things aren't perfect
and you don't hammer away of it

18:23.206 --> 18:25.088
out of respect for the marriage.

18:25.314 --> 18:29.063
For a marriage to work, you and
your husband have to be in cahoots.

18:29.512 --> 18:30.880
In cahoots ?

18:31.616 --> 18:34.489
Marriage is a silent
conspiracy between two people

18:34.566 --> 18:36.905
to not confess everything.

18:37.311 --> 18:38.892
To let sleeping dogs lie.

18:39.886 --> 18:40.828
I like that.

18:41.883 --> 18:43.151
I bet you do.

18:45.702 --> 18:48.432
And... that's worked for you marriage ?

18:49.567 --> 18:50.862
I think it has.

18:50.904 --> 18:54.078
My wife and I, we've been
in cahoots for 10 years.

18:54.380 --> 18:57.018
So does that mean she does or
doesn't know that you're gay ?

19:00.351 --> 19:02.184
She probably knows.

19:06.230 --> 19:09.210
Meter people! Meter
people! Let's settle down!

19:09.951 --> 19:12.659
Let's settle down! Alright! Alright!

19:13.689 --> 19:14.702
Item 1:

19:15.583 --> 19:18.624
Chuck's Char-Broiled around Mandeville
is starting a lunch special today.

19:18.742 --> 19:21.379
Burgers, fries and soda for 59 cents.

19:21.641 --> 19:24.221
Those of you working
Mandeville and its environs,

19:24.570 --> 19:28.275
expected 3 light backups and
plenty of red zones violations.

19:28.728 --> 19:30.923
59 cents for a burger ? What's in it ?

19:31.158 --> 19:33.304
German shepherd on a
sauce sesame seed bun.

19:34.015 --> 19:35.034
Moving on.

19:36.796 --> 19:39.489
We've received complaints
form some of the Citizenry

19:39.714 --> 19:43.032
about inappropriate
language, aggressive behavior.

19:43.355 --> 19:47.112
And in one instance, that a member
of this corps pulled a firearm.

19:48.650 --> 19:52.894
People, in a world of increasing
hostility, your job as always

19:53.030 --> 19:54.285
is to placate.

19:54.537 --> 19:56.273
To meet anger with stoicism.

19:56.876 --> 19:59.237
In short, no more mouthing off.

20:00.004 --> 20:01.511
If you cannot do that,

20:02.706 --> 20:05.104
If you cannot hold your tongue,

20:06.649 --> 20:08.785
then you should seek
another line of work.

20:10.681 --> 20:12.196
Okay. Let's roll!

20:15.944 --> 20:17.593
And people! People !

20:20.320 --> 20:21.693
Let's be careful out there.

20:46.090 --> 20:49.762
Okay, so if you wanna dial
someone in the office, you...

20:50.063 --> 20:51.206
I totally know this one.

20:51.943 --> 20:53.300
Look at those lips!

20:53.908 --> 20:56.146
I just wanna bite your face!

20:56.306 --> 20:57.841
You dial their extension first.

20:58.665 --> 21:00.376
I wanna tear your skin off,

21:00.447 --> 21:02.658
make pajamas out of them
and wear them to bed!

21:02.993 --> 21:03.913
Excellent!

21:06.806 --> 21:07.856
Should I answer it ?

21:08.332 --> 21:09.827
Let's give that a whirl.

21:09.930 --> 21:10.974
Okay.

21:12.927 --> 21:15.628
Happy Time. Millie's
phone. This is Brennan.

21:16.091 --> 21:17.782
- Good start.
- It's for you.

21:18.752 --> 21:19.816
Ask who it is.

21:21.091 --> 21:21.992
Who is it ?

21:23.063 --> 21:24.594
Daisy. Daisy Adair.

21:24.870 --> 21:28.470
Hi Daisy. Yeah. Millieâs training me.

21:29.657 --> 21:30.625
She's awesome.

21:31.081 --> 21:33.231
She's got the most beautiful eyes.

21:36.613 --> 21:37.665
What do I do ?

21:37.818 --> 21:40.824
- Put Daisy, Daisy Adair on hold.
- okay.

21:42.570 --> 21:45.519
You should probably
ask Daisy to hold first.

21:45.718 --> 21:48.064
- Hello ?
- Okay, click over.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.112
Click... click what back over ? What ?

21:50.501 --> 21:52.973
Hello ? Hello ?

21:53.951 --> 21:55.191
Okay, they'll call back.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.654
Do you wanna hang out tonight ?

22:01.698 --> 22:02.608
Yes!

22:04.559 --> 22:06.646
You know I don't do kids,
this is your post-it.

22:06.721 --> 22:10.125
Please just help me find L.
Sondheim then you can go, okay?

22:11.828 --> 22:13.684
I wanna strangle him, I really do.

22:13.869 --> 22:14.825
I just wanna kill him.

22:14.826 --> 22:16.413
Is your name L. Sondheim by any chance ?

22:17.462 --> 22:20.586
Come on, there will little cupcakes
and little whipped cream on them.

22:21.328 --> 22:22.323
Ten minutes.

22:22.368 --> 22:24.590
Here, come on, buddy. Come
on. Let's go! Let's go!

22:25.240 --> 22:26.736
There you go. Have a good time.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.692
Cesar! Cesar!

22:33.109 --> 22:34.090
Can I help you ?

22:34.189 --> 22:36.925
Yeah, we're here for the, you know,

22:37.031 --> 22:38.214
the little kids party.

22:38.477 --> 22:40.717
Please tell me you're
from the clown service.

22:41.041 --> 22:42.439
We're from the clown service.

22:42.479 --> 22:43.929
The clown finally showed up.

22:44.779 --> 22:46.678
Which one of you is the clown ?

22:48.624 --> 22:49.904
I think it's pretty obvious.

22:50.390 --> 22:53.350
You see the frail, indecisive
looking man in the plyed shirt.

22:53.902 --> 22:55.851
That's my husband. He's got you money.

22:56.441 --> 22:59.164
Go! Go! go! You were supposed
to be in costume 20 minutes ago.

23:01.731 --> 23:03.353
I really hate clowns.

23:03.585 --> 23:06.080
When I was 5 years old,
I kicked one in the nuts.

23:08.019 --> 23:10.429
That man over there wants
to give you some money.

23:12.555 --> 23:14.025
But if one little kid

23:14.486 --> 23:15.687
were to take a poke on me,

23:16.410 --> 23:17.803
I will punch each back.

23:18.182 --> 23:21.312
I swear to God I will kick
his little fucking teeth out.

23:22.979 --> 23:23.975
Clown!

23:25.714 --> 23:27.980
He's not one of those angry
alcoholic clowns, is he ?

23:28.073 --> 23:29.810
No, actually, he just wore off boozes.

23:29.891 --> 23:31.641
Strictly stealth water
over the last few weeks.

23:31.709 --> 23:34.041
All that stealth water would
make any clown little angry.

23:34.074 --> 23:36.380
- I don't get it.
- There was nothing to get.

23:39.467 --> 23:41.179
You cannot go out with this Brennan guy.

23:41.222 --> 23:42.148
It would never work.

23:42.149 --> 23:43.670
You're a Taurus, he's a Gemini.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.318
He's Lutheran, you're dead.

23:45.355 --> 23:47.045
You have to weasel your way out of this.

23:47.079 --> 23:48.595
You have to tell him no.

23:51.268 --> 23:53.622
Oh my God! Some slut is
stealing my boyfriend!

23:54.375 --> 23:55.331
Millie!

23:59.649 --> 24:01.296
Come on! Come! Come! Come!

24:02.445 --> 24:04.958
How would you like to be in
charge of another special project ?

24:05.081 --> 24:07.872
As in training someone
else with special needs ?

24:08.181 --> 24:10.575
Oh! How did it go with
Brennan and the phone system ?

24:10.831 --> 24:12.311
He went a little ADD on me

24:12.373 --> 24:14.474
when I tried to show him
how to use a speakerphone.

24:14.544 --> 24:17.538
This afternoon, we're gonna
try transferring calls.

24:17.964 --> 24:19.510
You seem a little distracted.

24:22.060 --> 24:23.564
Oh Fran!

24:23.821 --> 24:25.146
Have you no shame ?

24:26.720 --> 24:30.016
Please tell me you don't have
a crush on that simple boy!

24:30.154 --> 24:32.668
I don't. Just give me
the project, Dolores.

24:34.056 --> 24:35.780
These are top-secret files.

24:36.078 --> 24:37.543
- Shred them.
- Got him.

24:37.820 --> 24:39.048
They'll sleep with the fishes.

24:39.170 --> 24:42.524
You know, office
romances never end well.

24:42.837 --> 24:46.323
When Julio empties my trash basket,
he can barely make eye contact.

24:48.622 --> 24:50.978
That's... upsetting.

24:51.203 --> 24:54.547
- And that boy here.
- I know, I know...

24:54.751 --> 24:56.507
Look, you are still a baby.

24:56.590 --> 24:59.626
You have your whole life ahead
of you to find the right person,

24:59.691 --> 25:01.386
something that will really last.

25:07.398 --> 25:09.456
I'm a virgin with a death certificate.

25:09.522 --> 25:11.028
What the fuck am I waiting for ?

25:13.265 --> 25:15.943
The sound of my eating
makes you physically sick ?

25:19.122 --> 25:20.372
Oh yeah that's right...

25:20.817 --> 25:22.665
You save your best
shots for an audience.

25:24.392 --> 25:27.206
You know what, Clancy ? You don't
have to listen to it every night.

25:28.035 --> 25:30.779
You know what, Joy ? You don't
have to listen to it at all.

25:30.996 --> 25:32.787
You don't have to
listen to it ever again.

25:33.812 --> 25:34.754
What does that mean ?

25:38.635 --> 25:39.710
What does that mean ?

25:42.399 --> 25:43.346
Joy...

25:43.940 --> 25:45.292
Do you wanna be married to me ?

25:47.370 --> 25:48.573
I don't.

26:01.082 --> 26:02.792
Waiting for the right boy to come along.

26:06.058 --> 26:07.185
Right, Dolores.

26:07.553 --> 26:09.802
Although my body had been declared dead,

26:10.072 --> 26:11.654
it hadn't gone old.

26:14.194 --> 26:15.144
Fucking...

26:16.595 --> 26:17.444
What happened ?

26:17.445 --> 26:19.938
It's nothing. It's just a cut.

26:20.046 --> 26:20.764
I'm fine.

26:20.765 --> 26:22.104
- You're okay ?
- Yeah.

26:23.945 --> 26:24.890
Hey !

26:25.283 --> 26:27.543
Actually, I'm feeling a little lousy...

26:33.706 --> 26:34.910
I'll get you some water.

26:53.801 --> 26:54.873
Here you go, Emily.

26:56.717 --> 26:59.543
- This isn't a bunny rabbit.
- Yes, it is. Look, there he is.

26:59.890 --> 27:00.849
What is it really ?

27:01.396 --> 27:02.381
Go ask your mother.

27:04.550 --> 27:06.582
I want a bunny rabbit
balloon like Emily's.

27:06.922 --> 27:08.206
I bet you do, sweetheart.

27:08.328 --> 27:09.845
Clowns aren't supposed to talk.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.165
Yes, they are. Clowns talk.

27:11.421 --> 27:14.207
Mimes can't but clowns can
definitely fucking talk, alright ?

27:14.294 --> 27:15.025
Not true.

27:15.026 --> 27:16.745
Some clowns talk, some
make talking noises.

27:16.823 --> 27:18.385
Do me a favor. Give me a piece of cake.

27:18.409 --> 27:19.546
I want a bunny rabbit balloon.

27:19.576 --> 27:21.461
When I see some cake. You gotta move on.

27:21.786 --> 27:23.392
Please don't hump me on the frosting.

27:23.463 --> 27:24.434
Stupid !

27:24.435 --> 27:25.412
Hey !

27:25.482 --> 27:26.797
Can I talk to you for a second ?

27:26.827 --> 27:27.811
Yeah.

27:32.694 --> 27:33.713
This is my kid's party

27:33.979 --> 27:36.222
and this isn't a bunny rabbit.

27:36.816 --> 27:39.046
- Yes, sorry Mr. ?
- Sondheim.

27:40.928 --> 27:41.844
Lloyd.

27:42.434 --> 27:43.423
Look...

27:43.477 --> 27:44.855
Don't you have other stuff you can do ?

27:44.916 --> 27:46.263
Any magic tricks ?

27:46.361 --> 27:47.613
Yeah, I've got one or two.

27:47.696 --> 27:48.625
Well, use them.

27:50.205 --> 27:53.313
This is the only 6th birthday
my daughter will ever have.

28:07.320 --> 28:09.355
Here, drink some more water.

28:11.110 --> 28:12.765
I don't know why I liked him.

28:13.573 --> 28:15.831
Maybe just because that slut Fran did.

28:16.591 --> 28:19.759
But I think it had something to
do with my death this morning.

28:20.270 --> 28:23.311
I couldn't get that strange
pink flower out of my head.

28:23.818 --> 28:26.537
I felt as if something
was hanging by a thread.

28:26.937 --> 28:28.186
Not just my finger.

28:28.544 --> 28:30.552
And I had to try to hold on to it.

28:31.033 --> 28:31.984
Have another sip.

28:44.843 --> 28:46.424
I feel better.

29:05.144 --> 29:07.155
What are you ? Following me, Blondie ?

29:08.044 --> 29:09.883
Don't flatter yourself,
I have a post-it.

29:10.103 --> 29:12.658
C. Sullivan. Luck of the Irish.

29:15.546 --> 29:16.739
35 dollars ?

29:17.881 --> 29:19.458
Greedy fucking Americans!

29:19.873 --> 29:21.158
I put a curse on you.

29:21.301 --> 29:23.446
May you never walk the
Earth in happiness again!

29:23.518 --> 29:25.915
Sir, that voodoo shit don't
play with me, comprende ?

29:26.318 --> 29:28.792
Fuck you! Piece of
shit! Little meter maid!

29:29.022 --> 29:30.349
Fuck your balls.

29:35.071 --> 29:36.978
Let's go! Bring it on! Gloves off!

29:37.073 --> 29:39.324
Boss man says I can't.
I can't mouth off.

29:39.692 --> 29:41.316
Roxy can't mouth off ?

29:41.438 --> 29:43.922
You're like a bird without
a song. A really mean bird.

29:44.716 --> 29:45.684
Roxy...

29:45.939 --> 29:49.523
Why did you say I looked like a dog
who needed to be saved from the pound ?

29:49.726 --> 29:51.741
Don't do this to me, Daisy.

29:52.028 --> 29:54.449
I was just tired. I didn't
sleep well. I had a bad dream.

29:54.674 --> 29:58.084
Flying, swimming and running from
monsters, it all means the same thing.

29:58.259 --> 30:00.005
No pot tarts after 10.

30:00.675 --> 30:02.983
It was my first day on the
set of Gone with the wind.

30:03.077 --> 30:05.554
And you die, I know that story.

30:05.718 --> 30:09.552
In my dream, I'm about to meet
one of my idols, Vivien Leigh.

30:09.840 --> 30:11.252
Dreamt about it my whole life.

30:11.320 --> 30:12.753
I was really worried, you know.

30:12.824 --> 30:13.762
What if we don't get along ?

30:13.839 --> 30:14.981
What if she hates me ?

30:15.067 --> 30:16.009
Worse yet...

30:16.010 --> 30:17.396
What if she ignores me ?

30:17.687 --> 30:19.982
That will teach them to
mess with Catherine Sullivan.

30:23.857 --> 30:26.168
But in my dream, it's wonderful.

30:26.371 --> 30:28.681
She runs through a hall
as god is my witness.

30:28.783 --> 30:29.930
I'll never be angry again.

30:30.023 --> 30:32.578
I'll tell her it's a touch over
the top and she says I'm right.

30:32.685 --> 30:35.292
We just gossip and giggle
like long lost sisters.

30:38.020 --> 30:40.156
So that's why I was a little
out of it this morning.

30:40.196 --> 30:41.102
It was a rough dream.

30:41.291 --> 30:43.238
What is so rough about that dream ?

30:43.494 --> 30:44.522
It never happened.

30:44.718 --> 30:45.828
I died before I met her.

30:46.166 --> 30:48.358
Shut up out there.
It'll only be a minute.

31:01.511 --> 31:02.724
Bloody hell.

31:03.697 --> 31:06.918
I do believe this is a
symbol for "aim here".

31:09.447 --> 31:10.394
Wow!

31:13.327 --> 31:16.051
I find that comment
violent contemptible.

31:16.415 --> 31:17.486
Let's say you're sorry.

31:19.655 --> 31:20.525
I'm sorry, Rube.

31:20.526 --> 31:23.348
I'm sorry you're a 100 years old
and you'll never get to spank that.

31:31.323 --> 31:32.846
- Make a funny face.
- No!

31:32.979 --> 31:33.953
Go away.

31:34.069 --> 31:35.678
Give the kid a face. It's her birthday.

31:42.989 --> 31:43.981
He's funny.

31:44.600 --> 31:45.503
Yes, he is.

31:45.891 --> 31:47.412
Are you the clown's daddy ?

31:48.692 --> 31:49.650
No.

31:49.664 --> 31:50.679
Then why are you here ?

31:51.307 --> 31:54.673
I'm somebody's daddy. She's
just not at this party.

31:55.139 --> 31:56.086
And where is she ?

32:00.719 --> 32:03.380
Why don't you play with
the clown, sweetheart ?

32:07.529 --> 32:09.684
I want you to remember
how funny he was, okay ?

32:26.513 --> 32:28.935
My day had started with a death.

32:29.279 --> 32:33.563
The first sign of trouble was all those
bright orange pylons around the gas leak.

32:33.841 --> 32:36.437
You put them when you wanna
keep people at a distance.

32:36.828 --> 32:38.401
That's what I needed now.

32:38.584 --> 32:41.424
Lots and lots of orange pylons.

32:47.481 --> 32:48.827
How did it go ?

32:49.391 --> 32:50.455
How did what go ?

32:50.947 --> 32:52.165
Making out with Brennan ?

32:52.294 --> 32:53.711
Severing my middle finger ?

32:53.993 --> 32:57.296
Putting it back on without letting
everyone know I was a grim reaper ?

32:58.674 --> 33:00.455
It went well.

33:00.691 --> 33:02.293
I heard you cut yourself.

33:02.932 --> 33:03.890
It's nothing.

33:04.003 --> 33:06.348
You just need to take better
care of yourself, Millie.

33:06.475 --> 33:08.237
The world is a dangerous place.

33:08.319 --> 33:10.894
It's an easy place for
a young girl to get hurt.

33:11.278 --> 33:12.208
I'm fine.

33:12.262 --> 33:14.193
I think I'm gonna pull you off Brennan.

33:14.338 --> 33:20.141
Well, I was never really... on Brennan.

33:20.229 --> 33:22.445
You're smart, you're charming.

33:23.321 --> 33:25.247
You're a very complicated young woman

33:25.317 --> 33:29.609
and I just don't like to see your
talent wasted on projects like Brennan.

33:29.692 --> 33:31.007
What are we talking about ?

33:31.072 --> 33:33.659
We're talking about a
promotion, you silly goose.

33:34.099 --> 33:35.061
We are ?

33:35.062 --> 33:36.081
Oh I think we are.

33:36.193 --> 33:40.146
Two more days a week and two
hundred dollars more a week.

33:40.489 --> 33:41.447
You're shitting me ?

33:41.534 --> 33:43.802
Your new position at
Happy Time will be to, huh,

33:44.135 --> 33:45.948
interview potential temps.

33:46.040 --> 33:48.702
We're frittering away
your talents at data entry.

33:48.897 --> 33:52.306
And training boys like Brennan,
that's a waste of your time.

33:52.772 --> 33:54.212
Do we understand each other ?

33:55.282 --> 33:56.782
I won't let you down.

34:05.107 --> 34:06.052
That's a joke !

34:07.636 --> 34:09.027
Since I just got promoted,

34:09.110 --> 34:12.014
I just thought you two should know that
I take my coffee with a little milk,

34:12.110 --> 34:14.722
two sugars and a lot
less of your bullshit.

34:16.223 --> 34:18.460
- I hate her.
- What a bitch!

34:18.588 --> 34:20.722
Don't even turn to see the wreckage.

34:25.914 --> 34:27.804
Can you describe the other kid ?

34:31.725 --> 34:33.032
What the hell ?

34:34.315 --> 34:37.087
The other kid was a little
taller than this one.

34:37.183 --> 34:38.803
Slender built, baggy jeans.

34:39.135 --> 34:42.795
He had on a black sweatshirt with
some gang gang bull on the back of it.

34:42.871 --> 34:46.168
And then he headed North.

34:46.744 --> 34:48.813
He was pretty banged up to.

34:49.516 --> 34:50.571
What's your name ?

34:50.998 --> 34:51.906
Roxy.

34:52.842 --> 34:54.741
You're the one who close on this kid ?

34:55.943 --> 34:57.479
I like your style.

34:58.903 --> 35:00.008
You got the wrong job, Roxy.

35:01.227 --> 35:03.429
I ain't got nothing but wrong jobs.

35:05.242 --> 35:08.626
So do you guys just, like,
hate each other's guts ?

35:08.856 --> 35:11.222
No, your mother and I
don't hate each other.

35:11.913 --> 35:13.223
We love each other very much.

35:14.011 --> 35:17.412
- We just...
- We just can't live together.

35:18.364 --> 35:19.962
But we both love you.

35:21.026 --> 35:23.393
And even though others things

35:24.221 --> 35:25.895
will change, that won't.

35:26.132 --> 35:29.352
You know, Regg', it's okay to
feel whatever you're feeling.

35:30.039 --> 35:32.522
Don't be afraid to have feelings.

35:34.821 --> 35:36.618
What are your feelings, sweetheart ?

35:37.319 --> 35:38.503
I'm a little hungry.

35:40.909 --> 35:42.926
So which one of you gets...

35:43.161 --> 35:46.642
Well, your mother and I haven't
exactly worked that out but

35:47.098 --> 35:48.757
I know your mom wants you to...

35:48.900 --> 35:49.827
Who gets JD ?

35:52.157 --> 35:53.068
Well, sweetheart,

35:53.267 --> 35:54.548
JD is your dog.

35:54.998 --> 35:56.448
But I'm sure if you wanna

35:57.462 --> 35:58.930
lend him to your dad

35:59.335 --> 36:00.744
every now and then, you know.

36:01.588 --> 36:03.022
I'm sure he'd appreciate it.

36:03.395 --> 36:05.141
Titia Carter's parents got a divorce

36:05.433 --> 36:08.086
and her dad got this
really cheesy condo.

36:08.234 --> 36:10.661
Shag carpeting and mirrors everywhere.

36:10.845 --> 36:12.806
Well, I'm not gonna get
a cheesy condo, Reggie.

36:13.080 --> 36:14.343
You have to get a backyard.

36:14.807 --> 36:15.792
For JD.

36:16.278 --> 36:17.256
We'll see, sweetie.

36:17.462 --> 36:19.646
Most sorority houses
do come with backyards.

36:19.721 --> 36:21.151
You just can't leave it alone.

36:21.234 --> 36:22.602
You just can't help yourself.

36:22.832 --> 36:25.920
Great! I can't help myself.

36:26.057 --> 36:31.191
You've been tapping little Mrs. Kappa
Kappa Gamma's keg for a year now.

36:31.606 --> 36:33.835
Did it ever occur to you that maybe

36:33.902 --> 36:35.396
you pushed me in that direction ?

36:35.739 --> 36:39.985
Oh really! Poor you!
Please enlighten me!

36:40.076 --> 36:42.508
That's the way that you drive
everyone around you away.

36:42.723 --> 36:44.500
You did the same thing to George.

36:44.623 --> 36:46.041
You wanted her out of this house.

36:46.166 --> 36:48.565
You wanted her gone and now she's gone.

36:49.738 --> 36:50.812
Get out.

36:51.064 --> 36:52.064
Get out!

36:52.790 --> 36:56.557
Get out of this house
right now or I will scream!

37:01.279 --> 37:04.745
My parents took me and my little
sister to the circus every year.

37:05.129 --> 37:07.197
I like the trapeze artists the best.

37:07.274 --> 37:10.022
The flying Wallendas or
whatever they were called.

37:10.173 --> 37:11.937
Not the death defying stuff,

37:12.010 --> 37:15.138
the midair quadruple
flips and near misses.

37:15.528 --> 37:17.125
I covered my eyes for that.

37:17.202 --> 37:19.014
What I liked was part of the end,

37:19.108 --> 37:22.967
when they bounce into the net and
jumped up with that big Wallenda smile.

37:23.166 --> 37:24.646
The "tada!" part.

37:25.189 --> 37:26.107
Tada!

37:26.285 --> 37:27.303
I love that.

37:27.499 --> 37:29.050
It meant "I'm safe".

37:30.576 --> 37:31.546
Hi!

37:32.217 --> 37:33.211
Hi.

37:37.471 --> 37:39.090
I can't go out with you tonight.

37:39.601 --> 37:40.506
Okay.

37:41.830 --> 37:43.268
Maybe some other time.

37:44.440 --> 37:47.210
I don't... I don't know.

37:48.735 --> 37:49.692
Okay.

37:50.765 --> 37:52.414
That's cool, you know.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.174
Just... hang on to my phone number.

37:57.261 --> 37:58.208
Okay.

37:58.296 --> 37:59.827
Hopefully, I'll see around some time.

38:01.091 --> 38:04.547
Well, we work in the same office.

38:04.937 --> 38:05.890
Yeah.

38:09.403 --> 38:10.415
Does it hurt ?

38:12.160 --> 38:13.194
Your finger...

38:14.910 --> 38:15.891
No.

38:16.322 --> 38:17.516
Good. Good, I'm glad.

38:20.568 --> 38:21.518
Thank you.

38:32.060 --> 38:33.094
Tada!

38:33.490 --> 38:35.555
That was the thing with the Wallendas.

38:35.763 --> 38:38.570
Why I always covered my
eyes until it was over.

38:38.891 --> 38:41.069
Eventually one of them's gotta fall.

38:49.753 --> 38:51.170
Daddy, it's not breaking!

38:51.389 --> 38:52.724
I know, sweetheart.

38:59.470 --> 39:02.425
Hey, Eddy. Finish this.

39:06.388 --> 39:07.518
Oh man!

39:09.250 --> 39:10.786
Try not to kill anyone.

39:20.008 --> 39:23.570
Daddy! Daddy! It's still not breaking!

39:23.841 --> 39:24.743
Sweetie...

39:25.291 --> 39:28.034
The piÃ±ata is gonna crack
open. You'll get your candy.

39:30.512 --> 39:32.351
Has daddy ever let you down before ?

39:32.710 --> 39:34.537
- No.
- No...

39:45.168 --> 39:46.672
I'll bring it right back.

39:49.534 --> 39:50.491
Knock it out.

40:24.068 --> 40:26.515
- Am I dead?
- Yeah.

40:27.141 --> 40:28.078
Yeah, you're dead.

40:29.397 --> 40:30.351
Who are you ?

40:30.595 --> 40:32.157
Ma.. Mason.

40:35.964 --> 40:37.063
You're not the clown ?

40:37.170 --> 40:39.238
I'm no fucking clown.

40:39.320 --> 40:40.693
What were you doing here ?

40:41.041 --> 40:44.768
I was... I took your soul
before you, you know...

40:44.821 --> 40:46.847
And now I'm supposed to
escort you to your lights.

40:46.914 --> 40:49.142
No, what were you doing ?

40:49.992 --> 40:52.623
You made obscene balloon
animals for my daughter.

40:53.057 --> 40:54.841
You insulted all my guests.

40:55.455 --> 40:57.543
And the whole time you
knew I was gonna die.

40:58.198 --> 40:59.591
This is a joke ?

41:06.253 --> 41:08.541
This is how she'll
remember her birthday ?

41:08.625 --> 41:11.147
Do you wanna come with me ? I'll
take you to your lights, alright ?

41:11.250 --> 41:12.371
Stay away from me!

41:13.374 --> 41:15.161
Stay away from my family!

41:15.483 --> 41:17.301
Just.. just go!

41:46.022 --> 41:48.781
Life always seemed to
be about two things:

41:49.180 --> 41:51.088
feeling bad and then feeling better.

41:52.122 --> 41:55.020
For me, the feeling bad
part came pretty easy.

41:56.864 --> 41:58.175
But the feeling better part,

41:58.964 --> 42:00.637
how to make myself feel better,

42:01.795 --> 42:03.542
I never got that part down.

42:09.452 --> 42:11.069
These are too soft, always break.

42:11.119 --> 42:14.201
I keep telling you to buy the
number fours but you don't listen.

42:16.586 --> 42:17.627
What's with the sad face ?

42:18.174 --> 42:19.346
Some sad story.

42:19.465 --> 42:22.351
Rent's due, job sucks, cat's pregnant.

42:22.418 --> 42:24.474
You haven't seen Mason
lately, have you ?

42:25.873 --> 42:28.005
Tiffany, can I get some coffee please ?

42:28.173 --> 42:29.806
Why do you drink coffee so late ?

42:30.768 --> 42:32.111
You don't sleep as it is.

42:32.520 --> 42:33.938
Make that an espresso.

42:34.282 --> 42:35.296
Thank you.

42:35.751 --> 42:37.763
Little Mrs. Cranky Pants

42:38.076 --> 42:39.878
Whatever haunts your
soul at this moment,

42:42.420 --> 42:45.694
whatever need you feel to make
some kind of a statement or

42:46.313 --> 42:47.850
question my authority and...

42:51.628 --> 42:52.852
Is it something I did ?

42:53.036 --> 42:53.952
Nothing's wrong.

42:56.421 --> 42:57.987
I got a promotion.

42:58.078 --> 42:59.706
What kind of promotion did you get ?

42:59.774 --> 43:02.421
Two more big bills a week.

43:02.979 --> 43:04.537
I joined the police academy.

43:04.669 --> 43:05.635
No, you didn't.

43:05.913 --> 43:06.844
Yes, she did.

43:07.357 --> 43:09.831
They want more days
these Happy Time people.

43:11.479 --> 43:13.337
I think you should decline the offer.

43:13.424 --> 43:15.682
Fuck that! It's done. I'm doing it.

43:15.774 --> 43:17.275
Roxy, give us a moment, will you ?

43:20.255 --> 43:21.472
Why can't I do this ?

43:21.622 --> 43:24.453
I'm doing this. She's joining
the fucking police academy.

43:24.862 --> 43:26.327
Roxy's not you concern.

43:27.345 --> 43:29.537
I'm just worried that
you're taking on too much.

43:31.662 --> 43:34.636
People love to take roses and
they forget about the thorns.

43:34.955 --> 43:37.022
Okay, now that's really beautiful but

43:37.765 --> 43:39.045
I'm taking the promotion.

43:45.444 --> 43:47.038
I wouldn't do that.

43:48.318 --> 43:49.305
What did she do now ?

43:49.741 --> 43:50.837
Nice cross.

43:51.051 --> 43:52.630
Had any trouble getting the blood off ?

43:52.961 --> 43:54.006
No, just soap and water.

43:54.084 --> 43:55.926
I just think you should
go there tomorrow morning

43:56.008 --> 43:57.933
and tell that Dolores woman "thank you"

43:58.988 --> 43:59.979
but no.

44:00.539 --> 44:01.959
I want to do this.

44:02.562 --> 44:03.575
I want more money.

44:04.753 --> 44:06.504
I want, I want...

44:08.424 --> 44:10.698
- Look, peanut.
- Don't call me that.

44:16.939 --> 44:20.312
I just think all that want thing
is not so good at this point.

44:21.781 --> 44:24.224
That's all I have to
say about your promotion.

44:24.978 --> 44:28.541
Well, as mush as I've
enjoyed this little pow wow,

44:28.623 --> 44:31.548
I think I'm just going to
do what I'm going to do.

44:33.802 --> 44:35.775
Mrs.! Your espresso ?

44:36.051 --> 44:37.032
I don't want it.

44:37.110 --> 44:38.832
We made it. Somebody's gotta pay for it.

44:40.133 --> 44:43.077
She's a cop. Don't they
get everything for free ?

44:44.279 --> 44:45.929
I thought you were a meter maid.

44:46.637 --> 44:48.125
Well, I'm a cop now.

44:48.588 --> 44:49.789
Good for you, baby.

44:50.132 --> 44:51.683
Coffee's free for cops.

44:52.449 --> 44:54.443
Un-fucking-real!

44:59.220 --> 45:00.572
What do you mean "you're a cop" ?

45:00.962 --> 45:03.111
I joined the police
academy this afternoon.

45:05.088 --> 45:06.695
Yeah, I don't think I care for that.

46:40.008 --> 46:41.907
Hey there, Mr. Frog.

46:42.808 --> 46:43.865
How was your day ?

46:45.297 --> 46:47.478
Mine was fucked up.

47:00.526 --> 47:01.727
My flower.

47:09.689 --> 47:10.922
I thought you might want it.

47:14.200 --> 47:15.894
So who was that boy on the phone today ?

47:16.253 --> 47:17.208
Brendan.

47:17.974 --> 47:20.252
- Brennan.
- Brennan.

47:21.001 --> 47:24.036
Who's Brennan who thinks
you have beautiful eyes ?

47:24.158 --> 47:25.341
Nobody.

47:27.302 --> 47:29.507
- Okay, I kissed him!
- And ?

47:29.714 --> 47:31.880
- And ?
- What was the kiss like ?

47:34.455 --> 47:37.148
It's not too late to call him, you know.

47:37.214 --> 47:38.138
I'm not gonna call him.

47:38.182 --> 47:41.632
Dolores doesn't want me getting
involved with anyone at Happy Time.

47:41.798 --> 47:42.902
Besides he's not my type.

47:43.236 --> 47:44.142
Not even close.

47:44.602 --> 47:45.588
He's a pretty boy.

47:46.144 --> 47:47.215
It's obvious.

47:48.166 --> 47:49.272
Go to bed, Daisy.

47:51.970 --> 47:53.767
So Rube doesn't want you at Happy time.

47:53.905 --> 47:55.048
That makes you unhappy.

47:55.139 --> 47:58.616
Dolores wants you at Happy Time
but just so long as you're unhappy.

47:58.703 --> 47:59.923
It just... sounds like a plan.

48:01.467 --> 48:03.117
Life sucks and then you die.

48:03.726 --> 48:06.168
And then it still sucks.

48:08.697 --> 48:09.825
What's with the cross ?

48:11.252 --> 48:12.293
I don't know I like it.

48:12.604 --> 48:14.216
What are you like catholic now ?

48:14.892 --> 48:16.013
Yeah. Why not ?

48:16.215 --> 48:17.181
Good for you!

48:19.117 --> 48:20.898
- You're so angry.
- And you're not ?

48:20.975 --> 48:21.955
Listen to me,

48:23.905 --> 48:25.733
I died in 1938

48:25.967 --> 48:29.141
and there is not a day that goes by
that I don't wonder the things I did,

48:29.449 --> 48:30.472
things I didn't do.

48:30.539 --> 48:34.169
I know and you were going
to a great actress and

48:34.430 --> 48:36.208
you're beautiful and talented

48:36.295 --> 48:38.598
and you slept with all
the men under the moon.

48:38.685 --> 48:40.872
Stop making fun of me.
Just shut up for once.

48:41.031 --> 48:43.628
You think you know everything
? Look how unhappy you are!

48:46.078 --> 48:49.038
I'm sorry you were so young
when you died, Georgia.

48:51.736 --> 48:52.758
Good night.

49:01.131 --> 49:03.288
I knew who that pink flower was for.

49:04.316 --> 49:06.027
I knew who I betrayed.

49:07.092 --> 49:10.670
My short life was like our
family outings to the circus.

49:11.372 --> 49:12.642
It wasn't so bad.

49:13.727 --> 49:16.226
A bit with a clown, some cotton candy...

49:18.038 --> 49:19.943
And just as things got interesting,

49:21.004 --> 49:22.390
I covered my eyes.

49:25.934 --> 49:28.811
I know what that Wallenda
smile at the end was about,

49:30.941 --> 49:34.689
why they were so happy with their
midair flips and near misses.

49:35.606 --> 49:39.107
They were happy because they were
brave enough to be themselves.

49:41.079 --> 49:42.580
I mean if you're a Wallenda,

49:43.316 --> 49:45.097
you have to climb up that ladder,

49:46.471 --> 49:48.569
you have to grab that trapeze bar.

49:50.740 --> 49:51.913
If you're a Wallenda,

49:53.525 --> 49:54.949
you have to jump off...

49:56.142 --> 49:57.848
eyes wide open.
