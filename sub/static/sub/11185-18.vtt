WEBVTT

00:04.037 --> 00:05.243
I want you in for debriefing.

00:05.305 --> 00:06.443
This is a direct order.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.418
I don't work for you anymore.

00:08.475 --> 00:09.783
I'm sending a team after him.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.186
Priority 1.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.290
Get go’n! We're gonna die!

00:16.250 --> 00:18.127
String, what’s happened?

00:18.185 --> 00:19.926
I can't tell the friendlies
from the man-eaters.

00:19.987 --> 00:22.866
I'm up to my behind in alligators.
They're draining the pond.

00:22.923 --> 00:24.903
What do your instincts say about me?

00:27.861 --> 00:29.238
He won't make it.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:03.323 --> 02:06.202
You know, I don't think Dom had you
pegged for a Captain of Industry.

02:06.259 --> 02:08.102
We think it's a load of this.

02:08.695 --> 02:11.733
That old wrench buster. I sure
wish he could've come with you.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.706
You know, I'll bet you
he still thinks I stung him

02:13.767 --> 02:15.178
on that used chopper I sold him, doesn't he?

02:15.235 --> 02:18.375
You know he does. I hear about
it over and over and over.

02:20.007 --> 02:22.681
Jennifer, I want you
to meet Stringfellow Hawke,

02:22.743 --> 02:24.723
the second-best chopper jockey in my unit.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.587
It's a pleasure, Mr. Hawke.

02:27.014 --> 02:29.119
Was my boss really as good as he claims?

02:29.316 --> 02:32.058
Well, he could probably
major up with a little help.

02:32.185 --> 02:34.927
Here, too, regardless of what he says.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.302
I have several messages,
and your tickets came.

02:37.357 --> 02:38.461
Oh, thank you.

02:39.059 --> 02:41.733
Come on, stray dog.
We're swapping war stories.

02:41.795 --> 02:44.275
Jennifer, no calls. Only priority, you hear?

02:50.370 --> 02:52.748
All right partner, name
your poison. What'll it be?

02:52.806 --> 02:56.117
None for me, thanks.
That stuff makes me drunk.

02:58.211 --> 03:00.316
I'll tell you something, Hawke.

03:00.380 --> 03:04.055
It gets late a whole lot quicker
than you think, you know that?

03:04.651 --> 03:06.631
8 years it took me to put this together.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.224
8 years of stringing
together all kinds of junk

03:09.289 --> 03:11.530
with bubble gum and baling wire and spit.

03:11.591 --> 03:14.071
There it is. Not bad, huh?

03:14.361 --> 03:16.807
I know where the spit is, but
I don't see any baling wire.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.968
Well, you don't see any sand
in my teeth, either, do you?

03:19.032 --> 03:22.070
But I have kissed a few feet
on the way up, believe me.

03:23.136 --> 03:24.877
Before I forget about it, this is for you.

03:24.938 --> 03:25.939
Here.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.849
It's for a showing of an
artist that I'm sponsoring.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.478
That's some of his work
right there, you see.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.544
Real good.

03:31.278 --> 03:32.484
This is for tomorrow. I…

03:32.546 --> 03:35.220
Hold on a minute. Don't
try weaseling out of it.

03:35.282 --> 03:37.228
You promised me the weekend.

03:37.284 --> 03:38.991
The whole weekend, right?

03:39.186 --> 03:41.666
If I can't convince you to
come to work for me by then,

03:41.722 --> 03:43.998
why hell, I'll never
mention it again, all right?

03:44.057 --> 03:45.559
Besides, you're gonna like this guy Tolnor.

03:45.625 --> 03:48.504
His work is right up
your alley. Now, you be there.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.099
2:00 tomorrow, no excuses. You hear?

03:52.432 --> 03:55.038
This guy's gonna be the biggest
thing in the country by next year.

03:55.102 --> 03:56.376
Well, you know,

03:57.270 --> 03:59.750
you might just be right. He is really good.

04:03.877 --> 04:04.878
Listen,

04:06.079 --> 04:08.218
I just really don't wanna
be in your arms business.

04:08.281 --> 04:11.091
Hawke, Hawke, I'm not in the arms business.

04:11.284 --> 04:13.594
We simply teach and advise.

04:14.221 --> 04:17.827
The only thing we manufacture here are
a few small spare parts. That's it.

04:17.891 --> 04:20.963
Listen, Hawke. Hawke, you come in with me.

04:21.027 --> 04:24.304
Hey, why don't you bring Dom with you?
Hell, bring anybody you want.

04:24.364 --> 04:26.275
We'll be 1st-class all the way, pal.

04:28.034 --> 04:30.446
Hold that thought for a second. Yeah?

04:31.004 --> 04:33.484
It's a call I have to take.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.749
Oh, yeah, I'll get some coffee.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.161
Hi.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.297
Can I get a cup of joe here?

04:55.362 --> 04:56.568
Sure, help yourself.

05:05.238 --> 05:06.546
Can I help you?

05:06.673 --> 05:09.244
Yes, we have an
appointment with Mr. Karston.

05:11.611 --> 05:13.215
Sanitize the building.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.211
Drive, lady!

06:46.473 --> 06:47.474
What?

07:01.788 --> 07:03.290
Sorry, Victor. He got away.

07:03.356 --> 07:06.303
That's all right.
I recognized him. His name's Hawke.

07:06.493 --> 07:07.995
Stringfellow Hawke.

07:08.295 --> 07:11.037
He must be Karston's contact.
We've got to find out.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.084
Stop at the first phone booth.

07:22.375 --> 07:25.356
My God, he tried to kill you and me!

07:26.746 --> 07:28.384
You're not a criminal, right?

07:28.448 --> 07:29.825
Lady, just drive.

07:29.916 --> 07:32.055
No, of course not. He wasn't a cop.

07:32.485 --> 07:34.226
We've gotta call the cops.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.500
Jeez, you're hurt! You need a Doctor.

07:37.891 --> 07:40.462
A phone, too. I'll manage from there.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.098
All right.

07:42.562 --> 07:45.475
My name's Marilyn.
Marilyn Kelsy. What's yours?

07:47.133 --> 07:50.740
Oh, yeah. I like to read a lot.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.046
Daphne De Lane's my favorite.

07:53.106 --> 07:56.144
In fact, she wrote this book
called The Rose and the Lance.

07:56.209 --> 07:59.588
It had a similar situation as this.

07:59.646 --> 08:03.093
It was about this highwayman, and he
had an arrow through his shoulder,

08:03.149 --> 08:05.527
and he commandeered the Queen's carriage.

08:05.585 --> 08:07.087
Highwayman?

08:07.253 --> 08:09.790
Well, don't worry. It worked out.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.744
Marilyn, do me a favor, will you?

08:31.144 --> 08:33.215
Keep both hands up on the wheel

08:33.279 --> 08:35.020
so I can see them from the phone.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.216
Why?

08:37.751 --> 08:39.491
I don't know if it was just a coincidence

08:39.552 --> 08:41.691
that you drove by that intersection or not.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.395
Right now, I haven't got
time to take chances.

08:44.557 --> 08:46.036
You don't trust me?

08:46.226 --> 08:49.537
I got shot at and you
don't trust me? Unbelievable.

08:50.163 --> 08:53.144
Listen, I haven't got time for arguments.
Put your hands on the wheel.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.576
Now!

08:55.802 --> 08:56.803
Please.

08:58.338 --> 08:59.476
Please.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.378
Trust me.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.563
Yes.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.438
He said urgent?

09:26.332 --> 09:27.834
All right, put him through.

09:34.307 --> 09:37.880
Michael, why did the Firm
hit Jerry Karston today?

09:38.178 --> 09:39.213
Karston?

09:39.279 --> 09:41.020
I don't know anything
about a hit on Karston.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.685
Why do you think it was us?

09:42.749 --> 09:45.025
Don't you stonewall me, Michael.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.564
It was the Firm all the way.

09:46.619 --> 09:48.929
I could tell from their
uniforms and their weapons.

09:48.988 --> 09:50.262
I even recognized one of the guys.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.358
Who?

09:51.424 --> 09:52.767
I don't know. It was one of your boys.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.203
I've seen him in the hallway before.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.035
Hawke, this is Zeus.

09:56.362 --> 09:57.966
I want you in for debriefing.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.807
Damn you, Michael. I thought
this was a private conversation.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.744
Don't play games with me.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.741
I'll have a team after you in 3 minutes.

10:05.805 --> 10:07.716
Yeah, well, you've already
done that, haven't you?

10:07.774 --> 10:11.085
Hawke, if you'll come in, I'll
personally guarantee your safety.

10:11.177 --> 10:13.088
If you could, I might come in.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.621
I'll be in touch with you
when I find some more answers.

10:16.683 --> 10:19.061
You listen to me, Hawke.
This is a direct order.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.257
You listen to me!

10:20.320 --> 10:21.799
You seem to forget.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.600
I don't work for you anymore.

10:26.192 --> 10:27.227
That's it.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.636
I'm sending a team after him.

10:28.695 --> 10:30.902
Priority 1. National security.

10:31.397 --> 10:32.637
One question.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.546
Did we hit Karston?

10:47.247 --> 10:49.158
So where are we going to next?

10:50.016 --> 10:52.121
What makes you think we're going anywhere?

10:52.185 --> 10:54.529
Well, you've got people out there
who are trying to kill you.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.567
You don't wanna go to the Police.

10:56.623 --> 10:58.000
I can tell from your expression

10:58.057 --> 11:00.833
you didn't get the answer that
you wanted on the telephone.

11:00.894 --> 11:04.432
So I can only deduce that you haven't
been entirely forthcoming about…

11:04.497 --> 11:05.771
"Deduce, forth…"

11:05.832 --> 11:07.539
People don't talk like that.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.137
You must read too damn much Agatha Christie.

11:10.203 --> 11:13.343
Enough to know that a wounded man
can't just slide into a taxi

11:13.406 --> 11:15.352
and ask for the nearest hotel.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.516
Hey, what's this?

11:19.579 --> 11:22.082
Are you gonna shoot me
to show your appreciation?

11:23.650 --> 11:27.029
Oh, no, no, I was just kidding.
I don't want a reward.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.267
There's most of $300 there. Take it.

11:30.657 --> 11:31.965
No, I couldn't.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.128
I'm gonna have to take your car.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.197
What?

11:37.664 --> 11:40.611
You take the money as a security deposit.

11:40.667 --> 11:43.841
I'll get your car back to you
just as soon as I can. I promise.

11:43.903 --> 11:45.473
Forget it. No way.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.413
You're not in any shape to drive.

11:47.473 --> 11:49.976
Lady, I don't need another argument.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.283
It's Marilyn.

11:51.344 --> 11:54.052
Marilyn Kelsy is the name, not "lady."

11:54.113 --> 11:57.390
And I've got news for you. I
have already paid for this car,

11:57.450 --> 11:58.622
all but 4 payments.

11:58.685 --> 12:00.221
I don't loan this car to anybody.

12:00.286 --> 12:02.789
Not my Mother, not my
Father, not my friends.

12:03.089 --> 12:05.592
You just flew in my car out of nowhere.

12:05.658 --> 12:08.969
I missed my appointment, I got
shot at trying to help you.

12:09.028 --> 12:11.338
Now you come along, you tell
me you wanna take my car,

12:11.397 --> 12:13.968
and you won't even call
me by my proper name?

12:14.133 --> 12:17.080
I think I've got a little
reason to be upset, okay?

12:17.136 --> 12:20.606
I wanna keep my car, not let
you go out and wreck it.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.414
I'll take you wherever you wanna go.

12:30.149 --> 12:31.321
Okay.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.561
I need to locate a friend.

12:33.953 --> 12:34.954
That way.

12:44.631 --> 12:47.373
I don't care if we have to
tear the place apart, find it.

12:48.167 --> 12:49.168
Edwards,

12:49.535 --> 12:51.481
I want a bug on the phone,
strong transmitter.

12:51.537 --> 12:53.073
And I want the radio frequencies they use.

12:53.139 --> 12:55.085
Hawke goes to ground
somewhere else. He'll call.

12:55.141 --> 12:56.620
When he does, I want it.

13:05.818 --> 13:07.820
That job you were talk’n about,

13:08.354 --> 13:09.526
what was it?

13:10.189 --> 13:12.328
It wasn't a job, just an interview.

13:13.259 --> 13:14.761
Interview? What kind?

13:14.827 --> 13:16.898
It was catalog modeling. No big deal.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.343
You probably would have got it.
You're awful good-look’n.

13:21.401 --> 13:24.041
Just don't try to make up with me, okay?

13:24.604 --> 13:27.676
Would it make you mad if I told
you I sure like your outfit?

13:27.907 --> 13:29.284
Looks brand-new.

13:30.276 --> 13:32.449
$178 new,

13:32.945 --> 13:33.946
on sale.

13:35.048 --> 13:38.120
This represents 4 weeks
of tips at a coffee shop

13:38.184 --> 13:39.822
you wouldn't even know the name of.

13:39.886 --> 13:41.331
You probably wouldn't even go there

13:41.387 --> 13:42.923
if you did know the name of it.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.297
I'm not a model,

13:44.791 --> 13:46.793
and after 2 years of pounding on doors,

13:46.859 --> 13:48.770
they tell me I'm not an actress.

13:48.861 --> 13:50.169
I'm a waitress.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.135
And that makes you mad.

13:53.199 --> 13:54.940
No, you make me mad.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.077
You're the one that asked to drive.

13:57.136 --> 13:58.581
You should be going to the hospital,

13:58.638 --> 14:01.050
and all you care about
is to get to this hangar.

14:01.107 --> 14:02.984
That's right.

14:03.042 --> 14:05.818
Take a right at the next
street up here, please.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.533
Well, Dom's not back yet.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.605
He must have made the finals.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.568
Oh, great.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.837
Don't tell her who your
friends are or what's go’n on.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.880
She might understand it.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.213
Listen, you stay right here.

14:34.741 --> 14:37.813
No tell’n if we have a
reception committee or not.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.228
Look at this place.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.932
What happened here?

15:58.224 --> 16:00.431
They came here look’n for someth’n.

16:00.660 --> 16:01.968
Hey, are you okay?

16:03.162 --> 16:05.039
I can't think straight.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.402
Can I help you?

16:06.466 --> 16:08.810
I've gotta… I've gotta get going.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.304
God!

16:46.439 --> 16:48.043
Hi. How you do’n?

16:50.276 --> 16:51.653
How bad is this?

16:52.245 --> 16:54.316
Well, you almost died from macho.

16:54.447 --> 16:58.327
You nicked a major artery. They had
to perform microsurgery, Mr. Hawke.

16:59.285 --> 17:02.425
Oh, I discovered your ID in your wallet.

17:03.890 --> 17:06.268
Did the Doctors report a gunshot wound?

17:06.492 --> 17:07.936
Oh probably, but don't worry.

17:07.993 --> 17:10.667
I gave them a name that no
one would ever suspect.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.107
John Stringfellow.

17:12.198 --> 17:15.338
I thought it had a certain
literary ring. I hope you approve.

17:15.401 --> 17:16.903
Where's my clothes?

17:19.438 --> 17:20.916
What are you do’n?

17:22.441 --> 17:23.920
Where's my clothes?

17:38.090 --> 17:40.593
This is nuts. You're supposed to be resting.

17:41.093 --> 17:44.199
Yeah well, I'll have plenty of time
to rest while I wait for the cops.

17:44.263 --> 17:48.040
But if you just tell them the truth,
then the Police will protect you.

17:48.134 --> 17:49.135
Listen,

17:50.236 --> 17:53.149
the Police can't protect you
from pros like these guys.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.080
They just sit and they pick their time.

17:56.142 --> 17:57.143
Come on.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.794
Hey you, hold it!

18:10.456 --> 18:11.764
Bring it around back.

18:33.145 --> 18:34.215
Come on.

18:40.086 --> 18:41.190
We lost him.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.369
Where's this friend's house?

19:21.427 --> 19:23.338
It's over there, on the beach.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.342
It belongs to an old boyfriend.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.633
What's the matter, no key?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.586
I don't know about you, but I'm starved.

20:12.244 --> 20:14.451
I'll see what he's got in the fridge.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.589
Brian doesn't use this place that much,

20:17.650 --> 20:20.028
but he keeps it stocked for emergencies.

20:20.252 --> 20:21.424
Emergencies?

20:23.556 --> 20:25.695
Yeah well, he's in the record business.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.698
A lot of gush and go,
if you know what I mean.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.134
Pretty plush.

20:30.996 --> 20:32.703
Lota bucks, too, huh?

20:34.366 --> 20:36.209
You care that much about money?

20:36.268 --> 20:37.474
Only when I don't have any.

20:38.637 --> 20:39.877
I thought so.

20:40.339 --> 20:42.717
You know, you're not an easy guy to read,

20:43.542 --> 20:48.218
but you've got a few qualities
that slip through the facade.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.653
Facade?

20:52.651 --> 20:54.392
I wasn't aware I had one.

20:55.521 --> 20:59.526
You know, in Thompson's Run, Carla Dayton
writes about a character like you.

20:59.658 --> 21:01.137
The guy's got fear,

21:01.393 --> 21:05.068
but he doesn't let it overcome
him, you know? He harnesses it.

21:05.531 --> 21:07.442
You don't do so bad yourself.

21:08.567 --> 21:10.069
Oh no, that's panic.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.241
It's a completely different thing.

21:15.741 --> 21:17.914
You know, you don't trust so easily.

21:21.247 --> 21:23.989
But it means a lot to you,
maybe above all else.

21:42.501 --> 21:43.775
Hawke, where are you?

21:43.836 --> 21:46.749
Zeus has got half the Firm on
the streets looking for you.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.285
Well, I must have run into the other half.

21:48.340 --> 21:50.081
Somebody's trying to punch my ticket.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.382
Well, not from here.

21:51.443 --> 21:53.184
You can't guarantee that.

21:53.679 --> 21:55.454
You've had agents go independent before.

21:55.514 --> 21:57.323
Got anything on why Karston was hit?

21:57.383 --> 21:59.989
Not yet, but I do know we didn't do it.

22:00.052 --> 22:01.793
I'd like to believe that.

22:03.022 --> 22:05.696
Hawke, we just have bits and pieces so far.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.298
Listen, you just keep work’n on it.

22:09.695 --> 22:11.231
I'll get back to you.

22:12.398 --> 22:13.775
No, wait… Hawke?

22:20.206 --> 22:22.277
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

22:22.341 --> 22:25.413
I just wanted to know if you
wanted something to drink.

22:25.477 --> 22:28.651
Beer, wine, soda?

22:29.915 --> 22:31.292
Wine sounds good.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.262
You gonna join me?

22:44.530 --> 22:46.168
Oh Lord, what a mess!

22:46.232 --> 22:48.075
Oh, mamma mia!

22:48.133 --> 22:49.203
Hawke…

22:50.603 --> 22:52.082
- Santini…
- Hey, Dom.

22:52.137 --> 22:54.481
String! What the hell has happened?

22:54.773 --> 22:56.309
Where is he? Is he okay?

22:56.842 --> 22:57.980
Check the phone.

23:15.961 --> 23:18.840
String, we found it. Now, what happened?

23:19.531 --> 23:23.035
Now, the news is screaming that there's
been a massacre over at Jerry Karston

23:23.102 --> 23:24.911
and that you're involved!

23:25.137 --> 23:26.980
And that you're armed and dangerous

23:27.039 --> 23:29.542
and the cops are looking for
you and all that malarkey.

23:29.608 --> 23:30.746
Listen, Dom,

23:31.443 --> 23:33.389
right now I'm up to my
armpits in alligators

23:33.445 --> 23:34.947
and they're drain’n the pond.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.394
I can't tell the friendlies
from the man-eaters.

23:42.454 --> 23:44.229
Listen, I need to be picked up.

23:44.290 --> 23:45.928
Sure, where you at?

23:47.026 --> 23:49.870
I'm south of the Cohen,
first house on the point.

23:50.195 --> 23:52.004
You'll land right in the sand.

23:52.531 --> 23:53.874
I know the place.

23:54.400 --> 23:55.777
Did I hear Caitlin?

23:55.834 --> 23:57.780
Yeah, she's standing right here.

24:00.306 --> 24:02.809
Listen, tell her to stand by with the Lady.

24:03.876 --> 24:06.379
And Dom, please hurry.

24:08.047 --> 24:09.321
I'm on my way.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.859
Well, what? Is he involved?

24:15.020 --> 24:16.966
I didn't get too many details.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.660
But I'm gonna airlift him outta that place,

24:21.694 --> 24:26.074
and he wants you to
monitor us from the lair.

24:26.365 --> 24:28.504
Airwolf? Is it that serious?

24:45.651 --> 24:47.255
You made a phone call.

24:49.188 --> 24:50.758
Yes, Inspector.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.997
I called my agent about my
missed appointment this morning.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.530
But don't worry, I didn't
give away any secrets.

25:02.701 --> 25:05.773
So, you plan on deserting me
when your friend gets here?

25:10.042 --> 25:11.146
My friend?

25:11.744 --> 25:14.384
Well, it's obvious
you're waiting for someone.

25:16.215 --> 25:19.059
I don't suppose you'd
consider taking me with you.

25:20.285 --> 25:21.286
Marilyn.

25:24.990 --> 25:29.166
The Police have your name
and your car registration.

25:30.329 --> 25:32.138
It's just a matter of time.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.370
Those people are trying to kill me.

25:35.434 --> 25:36.845
Here, you're safe.

25:37.436 --> 25:39.609
Well, you would be safe here then, too.

25:41.573 --> 25:43.246
No, I don't think so.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.323
I suppose you're wondering why.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.557
Why I helped you.

25:50.649 --> 25:52.754
Maybe it's because I'm a romantic.

25:53.952 --> 25:56.523
I read a lot of adventures
like other people,

25:56.889 --> 25:59.631
but until today, I never touched it.

26:03.095 --> 26:04.631
In the last few hours,

26:04.696 --> 26:08.405
I have lived more than any
other time in my life.

26:08.667 --> 26:10.578
Every minute, every second,

26:12.438 --> 26:13.610
I was alive.

26:15.774 --> 26:17.811
Well, don't develop a taste for it.

26:19.745 --> 26:22.817
The next time you turn the
page, it's liable to be empty.

26:23.449 --> 26:24.689
I don't care.

26:27.453 --> 26:30.434
I know what I have a taste
for, Stringfellow Hawke.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.133
I wish you'd trust me.

26:40.566 --> 26:41.943
And don't deny it,

26:42.267 --> 26:44.304
'cause I can see it right there.

26:44.503 --> 26:47.973
Every single time something unusual
happens, it gets a little bigger.

26:48.040 --> 26:51.317
Like my knowing about the key,
and the phone conversation.

26:52.010 --> 26:54.047
Marilyn, you know, in my business,

26:54.913 --> 26:57.826
a healthy skepticism
is just that. It's healthy.

26:57.883 --> 27:00.955
I know, but you've gotta
have instincts, too.

27:02.921 --> 27:05.094
What do your instincts say about me?

27:09.027 --> 27:10.904
That you're somebody special,

27:14.133 --> 27:16.340
someone I should count on.

27:28.714 --> 27:31.320
Listen, you stay here.

27:31.750 --> 27:33.991
You don't move from here.

27:35.254 --> 27:36.665
I'll call you.

27:38.790 --> 27:40.895
Okay, if that's the way it's gotta be.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.434
No sign of ‘em.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.738
Check the house again.
They've gotta be here.

30:03.468 --> 30:04.674
Stay here.

30:04.736 --> 30:06.773
If you think you're gonna
go and leave me here…

30:06.838 --> 30:10.047
Listen, if I don't get to that chopper,

30:10.342 --> 30:12.049
Dom lands as a dead man.

30:13.879 --> 30:15.586
My best chance is alone.

30:16.581 --> 30:17.753
This is it, then, huh?

30:17.816 --> 30:18.851
No.

30:18.917 --> 30:20.294
Hawke, come back.

30:21.253 --> 30:22.630
To claim my lady?

30:31.096 --> 30:32.097
Victor.

30:34.666 --> 30:35.667
Get them.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.386
He won't make it.

32:06.892 --> 32:08.894
Dom. Come in, Dom. This is Hawke.

32:10.162 --> 32:11.505
I hear ya, babe.

32:11.563 --> 32:14.373
Listen, I'm about 5 minutes from touchdown.

32:14.499 --> 32:16.911
Abort that, bandits have taken that area.

32:17.102 --> 32:20.675
Okay. Okay. What bandits?
Are you all right?

32:20.906 --> 32:22.214
For the moment.

32:22.407 --> 32:23.477
What's go’n on?

32:23.542 --> 32:25.579
Listen, land someplace quick.

32:25.644 --> 32:28.250
Get on a clear line to Archangel.

32:28.313 --> 32:30.816
I'll meet him at Twin Oaks in 30 minutes.

32:31.216 --> 32:32.627
Twin Oaks, 30 minutes.

32:32.684 --> 32:35.392
Then get to the Lady
and stand by with Caitlin.

32:36.888 --> 32:39.732
I'd feel a lot better
if I knew what was go’n on.

32:39.825 --> 32:41.862
So would I. Just stand by the Lady.

33:25.904 --> 33:27.383
Where the hell have you been?

33:27.439 --> 33:29.476
Dodging bullets, and I'm tired of it.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.043
Talk to me, Michael.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.046
Take a look at these.

33:43.054 --> 33:44.294
That's the guy.

33:44.656 --> 33:45.930
Victor Resnick.

33:45.991 --> 33:48.267
Disappeared in East Berlin
about 6 months ago.

33:48.326 --> 33:51.000
We weren't sure if he
defected or was captured.

33:51.062 --> 33:52.302
Now we know.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.537
So, you're say’n this guy works
for the other side, huh?

33:55.934 --> 33:57.436
Why'd they kill Jerry Karston?

33:57.502 --> 33:59.413
And why the hell are they try’n to kill me?

33:59.471 --> 34:02.475
Your friend, Hawke, was a double agent.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.248
Jerry? Oh, come on.

34:04.309 --> 34:07.256
We had him cold, and then Zeus pushed him.

34:07.312 --> 34:09.417
The only way he could
avoid prosecution as a spy

34:09.481 --> 34:11.859
was to deliver something, something big.

34:13.083 --> 34:14.563
You guys always push.

34:14.619 --> 34:15.654
That's part of the job.

34:15.719 --> 34:18.929
Anyway, Karston promised to
deliver the engineering schematic

34:18.989 --> 34:20.469
for the new ground-to-air missiles

34:20.525 --> 34:23.266
the other side is moving
into the Middle East.

34:24.829 --> 34:27.742
So, Victor and his pals showed
up to collect the material

34:28.065 --> 34:29.373
and kill Jerry.

34:29.833 --> 34:31.574
Then when they saw me,

34:32.404 --> 34:34.281
they must’ve assumed I was the pickup man.

34:34.339 --> 34:35.340
Right.

34:35.440 --> 34:38.420
And obviously, they still
haven't found the material.

34:40.812 --> 34:42.553
They think I still got it.

34:51.422 --> 34:52.663
That's Zeus.

35:00.765 --> 35:03.769
Rhonda! Call this in and get out of here!

35:04.069 --> 35:05.446
I'm going with you.

35:12.177 --> 35:14.680
Code 4! We have a Code 4!

35:53.451 --> 35:54.953
Do something, Hawke.

35:56.221 --> 35:57.222
Not that!

36:22.347 --> 36:24.452
You're certifiable, you know that?

36:24.749 --> 36:26.228
Yeah, but it’s not nice work.

36:26.284 --> 36:28.195
Yeah, but there's always tomorrow,

36:28.253 --> 36:30.290
and these people aren't gonna quit.

36:30.355 --> 36:32.494
Not until they find that schematic.

36:33.725 --> 36:38.003
Are you sure Karston didn't say
something or mention a place?

36:38.863 --> 36:39.864
You know,

36:41.633 --> 36:43.135
he did give me this.

36:43.668 --> 36:46.706
I was supposed to go to an
art show tomorrow afternoon.

36:46.905 --> 36:48.509
Well, this could be it.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.015
No, that is it.

36:50.141 --> 36:52.246
He wouldn't take no for an answer.

36:52.610 --> 36:53.953
Well, what was supposed to happen?

36:54.012 --> 36:57.186
I mean, was the drawing supposed to
be hidden in the building somewhere?

36:57.248 --> 36:58.886
Under a painting?

36:58.950 --> 37:02.591
Or maybe he was supposed to meet a 3rd
party who was holding it for him?

37:02.987 --> 37:04.227
I don't know.

37:04.289 --> 37:07.429
In order to find out, we're gonna
have to play the whole thing out.

37:07.492 --> 37:08.732
You're right.

37:28.313 --> 37:29.690
Your ticket, sir?

37:35.854 --> 37:37.856
Keep this. There'll be a drawing later.

37:37.922 --> 37:38.923
For what?

37:38.990 --> 37:41.061
A painting. A Tolnor original.

39:13.551 --> 39:15.929
Oh Hawke, they made me come here.

39:16.888 --> 39:17.889
Why?

39:18.156 --> 39:20.136
Okay, all they want is your ticket,

39:20.458 --> 39:21.835
that little stub.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.463
If you give it to ‘em, they'll let you go.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.371
They'll let us walk outta here.

39:25.430 --> 39:26.534
What do they want with this?

39:26.598 --> 39:28.976
I don't know, they just said to get it.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.872
Could have a microdot with a schematic on it.

39:33.938 --> 39:37.545
Don't ask me. Just give it
to me, please. Then we can go.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.473
Hawke, listen.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.141
All I want is your ticket stub.

40:06.871 --> 40:08.282
And what do I get?

40:08.740 --> 40:09.980
Safe passage.

40:10.208 --> 40:12.085
Your life. The girl's life.

40:13.144 --> 40:16.057
Your friend Karston made a
terrible mistake. He stole from us

40:16.114 --> 40:18.788
in order to square his
accounts with your man Zeus.

40:18.850 --> 40:20.386
Zeus is not my man.

40:21.519 --> 40:24.591
Well, be that as it may, we've
gone to a great deal of trouble

40:24.656 --> 40:26.431
and considerable expense, loss of life.

40:26.491 --> 40:29.836
Yours and the girl's will not
make any great difference.

40:31.729 --> 40:33.231
Your ticket, please.

40:35.033 --> 40:36.034
All right.

40:37.535 --> 40:39.811
She holds it till we get outta here.

40:41.072 --> 40:42.449
Whatever you say.

40:44.008 --> 40:46.989
Marilyn, if those guys get that
ticket, we're as good as dead.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.183
But he said…

40:48.246 --> 40:50.192
I don't care what he said.

40:50.248 --> 40:53.752
What he says and what he does are 2
different things. He's dangerous.

41:04.262 --> 41:07.505
Excuse me. Oh! What are you
doing? Hey, let go of him!

41:07.565 --> 41:10.774
What are you doing? Stop! Stop pushing!

41:10.835 --> 41:12.143
How… some people have no manners.

41:12.203 --> 41:13.341
Come on, let's get outta here.

41:13.404 --> 41:14.576
What are you doing?

41:16.174 --> 41:17.653
Red alert. Code 1.

41:18.242 --> 41:20.654
Hold it. Don't panic.
Everybody just stay back.

41:20.712 --> 41:22.214
Hold it! Hold it!

41:22.280 --> 41:24.692
Hold it! Just don't panic!

41:24.749 --> 41:27.593
Remain here, stay calm, and
everything will be all right.

42:11.629 --> 42:12.903
Assault squad!

42:14.732 --> 42:16.678
It's a trap. Let's get outta here.

42:44.695 --> 42:45.696
Okay.

42:46.097 --> 42:47.735
We gave it our best shot.

42:47.799 --> 42:49.176
I'm ready to take a draw.

42:49.233 --> 42:50.473
Game's not over yet.

43:02.713 --> 43:04.021
Marilyn, you stay here.

43:04.082 --> 43:06.528
I'm in this thing till the
end, Stringfellow Hawke.

43:06.584 --> 43:09.656
I'll hold onto the outside
of that thing if I have to.

43:11.689 --> 43:13.100
What the hell. Come on.

43:27.872 --> 43:30.045
Calling Beta 3. This is Beta 4.

43:30.108 --> 43:31.917
We need emergency retrieval.

43:32.110 --> 43:34.556
Roger, Beta 4. We are ready to receive you.

43:34.612 --> 43:36.421
Proceed out of the danger zone.

43:42.186 --> 43:44.689
String, did you copy that transmission?

43:45.289 --> 43:48.293
It sounds like they plan to
rendezvous with a trawler.

43:48.359 --> 43:49.394
How the…

43:49.460 --> 43:53.135
Just like Antoinette Desmond's
novel Spy's Secret Passion.

43:55.500 --> 43:56.501
Oh, yeah.

43:57.535 --> 43:58.741
Sure.

44:02.673 --> 44:04.346
There's no time. We got less than 3 minutes.

44:04.408 --> 44:06.183
And if they reach that foreign ship,

44:06.244 --> 44:09.589
outside of US territorial
waters, they're home free.

44:35.673 --> 44:37.675
Resnick, give it up.

44:41.913 --> 44:43.392
Land at our instruction.

45:18.316 --> 45:19.317
My God!

45:29.594 --> 45:32.768
Well, at least you know
how the story ends this time.

45:45.076 --> 45:48.455
Well, you've done your country
a great service, Ms. Kelsy.

45:48.512 --> 45:51.152
Unfortunately, there can be
no official recognition

45:51.215 --> 45:54.958
due to the nature of the circumstances.

45:55.219 --> 45:56.596
Why not, Michael?

45:57.188 --> 45:58.690
The lady risked her life.

45:58.990 --> 46:01.095
I still prefer Ms. Kelsy.

46:01.559 --> 46:04.768
Yeah, without Marilyn, you and
Zeus would be on the carpet.

46:04.829 --> 46:07.332
Yeah. Come on, Michael,
she's a legitimate hero.

46:07.398 --> 46:09.571
I agree, but if we call attention to it,

46:09.634 --> 46:13.172
every Agency in the country will
know we don't have the microdot.

46:13.471 --> 46:14.779
Oh, but you do.
