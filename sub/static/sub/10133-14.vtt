08:17.956 --> 08:19.958
Alright, fellas,

08:17.956 --> 08:19.958
let's play a little Five-Card

08:20.000 --> 08:21.876
Nebraska, Becky's wild.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.586
Play what?

08:23.628 --> 08:26.089
I'm sorry, fellas. I'm having

08:23.628 --> 08:26.089
a problem with my girlfriend.

08:26.131 --> 08:28.716
She wants us to spend

08:26.131 --> 08:28.716
Christmas in Nebraska.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.302
So tell her you don't wanna go.

08:30.344 --> 08:31.511
Oh, Jesse can't do that.

08:31.552 --> 08:33.721
You see,

08:31.552 --> 08:33.721
he and Becky work things out

08:33.763 --> 08:38.352
with open and honest

08:33.763 --> 08:38.352
communication.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.437
You guys should see it.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.437
It really is cute.

08:40.479 --> 08:41.896
[laughter]

08:43.315 --> 08:45.359
You're in a lot

08:43.315 --> 08:45.359
of trouble, buddy.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.651
Why?

08:46.693 --> 08:49.488
Tell her how you feel,

08:46.693 --> 08:49.488
openly and honestly?

08:49.529 --> 08:51.448
- Yeah.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.448
- Do you get your way?

08:51.490 --> 08:53.908
- No.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.908
- Pack your long johns, pal.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.077
You're going to Nebraska.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.287
Not going to Nebraska, alright.

08:57.329 --> 08:58.913
I went to Nebraska

08:57.329 --> 08:58.913
for Thanksgiving.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.790
This time she's gonna

08:58.955 --> 09:00.790
do what I wanna do, alright?

09:00.832 --> 09:02.834
Hey, don't tell us, tell her.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.627
I'll tell her. I-I'll tell her.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.380
I'll just call her later.

09:06.421 --> 09:07.755
Call now.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.091
(all)

09:07.797 --> 09:10.091
Call now. Call now.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.844
(all)

09:10.133 --> 09:12.844
Call now!

09:10.133 --> 09:12.844
Call now! Call now!

09:12.886 --> 09:15.263
Call now!

09:12.886 --> 09:15.263
Call now! Call now!

09:15.305 --> 09:18.683
'Call now!

09:15.305 --> 09:18.683
Call now! Call now!'

09:18.725 --> 09:20.227
Whoa! Ho-ho-ho!

09:20.268 --> 09:22.103
Yeah, Becky. Listen, it's me.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.856
I've made a decision we're going

09:22.145 --> 09:24.856
to Graceland this Christmas.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.400
End of discussion. Case closed.

09:26.441 --> 09:28.151
- 'Yeah!'

09:26.441 --> 09:28.151
- Alright!

09:28.193 --> 09:30.737
And another thing. Call

09:28.193 --> 09:30.737
me when you get this message.

09:30.778 --> 09:32.572
Thanks.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.908
Alright, boys!

09:32.613 --> 09:34.908
Let's play a little poker!

09:36.410 --> 09:38.745
Now, D.J., we like Brian

09:36.410 --> 09:38.745
to go to bed by nine

09:38.786 --> 09:40.997
but sometimes

09:38.786 --> 09:40.997
his inner clock says ten

09:41.039 --> 09:43.624
so just go with

09:41.039 --> 09:43.624
his natural flow.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.668
So he goes to bed

09:43.666 --> 09:45.668
whenever he wants?

09:45.710 --> 09:47.504
That's the rule.

09:47.546 --> 09:51.466
Emergency numbers are posted

09:47.546 --> 09:51.466
on the Sub-Zero.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.218
If our stockbroker calls

09:53.260 --> 09:55.220
tell him he can fax

09:53.260 --> 09:55.220
the information

09:55.262 --> 09:57.055
directly to our BMW.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.767
Brian, come say hello to D.J.

10:03.019 --> 10:06.647
Hi, D.J. We're going

10:03.019 --> 10:06.647
to have a lot of fun tonight.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.358
That's what I'm here for.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.151
- Bye, Brian.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.151
- Night, Bri.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.195
Bye, have fun

10:10.193 --> 10:12.195
at your costume party.

10:12.237 --> 10:15.449
[chuckles]

10:12.237 --> 10:15.449
We're going

10:12.237 --> 10:15.449
to a Grateful Dead concert.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.493
Stay mellow.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.705
- Hi, Brian.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.705
- Hi, D.J.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.083
I hear it's

10:22.747 --> 10:25.083
your first time babysitting.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.086
No, that's not true.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.086
I babysit Michelle all the time.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.797
Well, this will be different.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.175
Brian, let's

10:32.048 --> 10:34.175
be friends, alright?

10:34.217 --> 10:36.136
Give me half the money

10:34.217 --> 10:36.136
you're making off me

10:36.177 --> 10:38.597
and maybe I'll be your friend.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.181
Not a prayer.

10:40.223 --> 10:42.809
I'm saving up for my own phone.

10:42.850 --> 10:46.980
So, uh, would you like

10:42.850 --> 10:46.980
to play a nice, quiet game

10:47.021 --> 10:49.649
or would you like

10:47.021 --> 10:49.649
to go straight to sleep?

10:49.690 --> 10:51.109
Hiya!

10:51.151 --> 10:53.612
I'm a Teenage Mutant

10:51.151 --> 10:53.612
Ninja Turtle.

10:53.653 --> 10:57.657
And you are the evil

10:53.653 --> 10:57.657
Lord Krang from Dimension X!

10:57.698 --> 11:00.827
Now, kneel before me

10:57.698 --> 11:00.827
or I'll<i> ninjutsu</i> you!

11:00.868 --> 11:02.703
Ha! Hu! Hiya!

11:02.745 --> 11:04.414
Ya! Hiyauh!

11:06.666 --> 11:10.128
- I'm not kneeling before you.

11:06.666 --> 11:10.128
- Wanna bet?

11:10.170 --> 11:14.508
Do what I say or I'll smash

11:10.170 --> 11:14.508
this and say you did it.

11:14.549 --> 11:17.260
- You wouldn't dare.

11:14.549 --> 11:17.260
- Oh, no?

11:20.221 --> 11:22.681
Lucky catch, Lord Krang.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.267
This means war!

11:24.309 --> 11:25.644
Hiya!

11:25.684 --> 11:27.103
Yow! Chow! Chow..

11:28.104 --> 11:29.439
[instrumental music]

11:35.654 --> 11:37.572
Give me my purse back.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.907
Come here, you little mutant.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.577
- Freeze!

11:39.949 --> 11:42.577
- Brian!

11:42.619 --> 11:46.623
Do what I say, or your purse

11:42.619 --> 11:46.623
goes into the fish-tank.

11:46.665 --> 11:51.294
Forget it, Brian.

11:46.665 --> 11:51.294
I am not shaving my head.

11:51.336 --> 11:52.379
[knock on door]

11:52.420 --> 11:53.463
Who's that?

11:53.505 --> 11:55.340
I hope it's the police.

11:57.716 --> 11:59.427
- Who is it?

11:57.716 --> 11:59.427
- 'It's me.'

12:01.762 --> 12:03.139
Hi, Deej. How's it going?

12:03.181 --> 12:06.226
Oh, no! Not Kimmy Gobbler!

12:07.477 --> 12:09.312
He's got my purse. What do I do?

12:09.354 --> 12:11.105
Watch this.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.692
Alright, chump. Drop the purse

12:11.147 --> 12:13.692
right now or I'm gonna kiss you.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.943
Yuck!

12:15.985 --> 12:18.530
It's not very flattering,

12:15.985 --> 12:18.530
but it works.

12:18.572 --> 12:21.700
You haven't seen the last of me.

12:21.740 --> 12:25.495
Kimmy, why didn't you tell me

12:21.740 --> 12:25.495
this kid was a baby Godzilla?

12:25.537 --> 12:27.872
Relax, come on,

12:25.537 --> 12:27.872
I'll show you where they hide

12:27.914 --> 12:29.457
the imported chocolates.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.252
Prepare to die, slime burgers!

12:32.293 --> 12:33.503
[water squirting]

12:35.505 --> 12:39.092
[sighs]

12:35.505 --> 12:39.092
Okay, that is it.

12:35.505 --> 12:39.092
I am through with playing games.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.759
You'll never catch me!

12:40.801 --> 12:42.596
Hey! Hey, I'm stuck.

12:42.637 --> 12:43.888
I can't get out.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.640
Help!

12:46.641 --> 12:48.767
Kimmy, he's really stuck.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.937
Great. Let's go watch TV.

12:50.978 --> 12:53.314
Brian, stay calm.

12:50.978 --> 12:53.314
Kimmy, keep an eye on him.

12:53.356 --> 12:54.608
I'll be right back.

12:56.651 --> 12:59.028
Hey, Brian

12:59.070 --> 13:00.614
wanna smell my feet?

13:00.655 --> 13:02.156
[screams]

13:05.452 --> 13:09.080
Kimmy, it won't help

13:05.452 --> 13:09.080
if he passes out.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.374
- Help me!

13:09.122 --> 13:11.374
- Good news, Brian.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.126
You'll be able to slide

13:11.416 --> 13:13.126
right out of there

13:13.167 --> 13:14.711
as soon as we butter your head.

13:18.256 --> 13:19.798
This will never work.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.469
You're dumb girls.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.887
I think we better

13:22.510 --> 13:24.887
butter his whole head.

13:30.268 --> 13:33.521
Yuck! This is disgusting!

13:35.440 --> 13:37.024
(D.J.)

13:35.440 --> 13:37.024
Okay, Brian.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.986
Now try to slide out

13:37.066 --> 13:39.986
nice and easy.

13:40.027 --> 13:41.655
But be careful.

13:42.781 --> 13:45.408
It's not working.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.577
Get me out of here!

13:47.619 --> 13:50.288
- I'd better go call my dad.

13:47.619 --> 13:50.288
- Don't do that.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.873
If you admit to your dad

13:50.330 --> 13:52.873
that you can't handle this job

13:52.915 --> 13:54.626
then you're never gonna

13:52.915 --> 13:54.626
get your own phone.

13:54.668 --> 13:57.587
[sighs]

13:54.668 --> 13:57.587
But I don't know

13:54.668 --> 13:57.587
what else to do.

13:57.629 --> 14:00.423
Brian, I'm gonna go get

13:57.629 --> 14:00.423
my dad's chainsaw.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.049
Help!

14:04.927 --> 14:07.013
My cigarette bothering you?

14:07.054 --> 14:09.557
Oh, no, it's a poker game.

14:07.054 --> 14:09.557
Your eyes are supposed to sting.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.603
It's my last cigarette

14:11.476 --> 14:13.603
of the evening.

14:13.645 --> 14:14.813
What a shame.

14:18.149 --> 14:19.776
Oh, here's

14:18.149 --> 14:19.776
a refreshing new smell.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.405
Hi, boys. What's happening?

14:24.447 --> 14:26.825
Hey, Michelle, how you doing?

14:26.866 --> 14:29.369
Dad, she won't listen to me.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.579
Watch. Michelle, go to bed.

14:34.165 --> 14:36.209
Hey, Michelle, it's time

14:34.165 --> 14:36.209
to go night-night.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.085
We're all going sleepy.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.085
Right fellas? Come on.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.505
That's right, Michelle, look.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.551
Fellas, sleepy.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.639
See? Everybody's sleeping.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.683
Where are their pajamas?

14:53.434 --> 14:55.562
Under their clothes.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.562
Come on, let's go.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.271
- Shh!

15:01.526 --> 15:03.236
Alright, boys,

15:01.526 --> 15:03.236
coast is clear. Everybody up.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.696
Okay, come on, come on.

15:10.201 --> 15:12.620
Joey. Joey!

15:14.121 --> 15:17.083
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

15:14.121 --> 15:17.083
I dreamt I actually won a hand.

15:18.626 --> 15:19.627
[telephone ringing]

15:19.669 --> 15:21.045
I got it.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.882
[laughs]

15:21.087 --> 15:23.882
Alright, guys,

15:21.087 --> 15:23.882
a little Five-Card Draw.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.007
Ante up, here.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.219
Hey, who took my chips?

15:28.261 --> 15:30.764
Everybody took your chips.

15:30.805 --> 15:33.767
Yeah, D.J. Yeah,

15:30.805 --> 15:33.767
I'll be right there.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.101
Guys, I gotta go, my daughter's

15:35.142 --> 15:36.644
having some

15:35.142 --> 15:36.644
babysitting problems.

15:36.686 --> 15:39.230
Hey, could you pick me up

15:36.686 --> 15:39.230
a pouch of pipe tobacco?

15:44.360 --> 15:47.697
Jess, I've been a pretty regular

15:44.360 --> 15:47.697
guy tonight, wouldn't you say?

15:47.739 --> 15:49.657
Yes, actually,

15:47.739 --> 15:49.657
I'm quite proud of you.

15:49.699 --> 15:53.202
In that case, there's something

15:49.699 --> 15:53.202
I'd like to say before I go.

15:53.244 --> 15:55.996
You, sir, are a chimney.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.707
Not only are

15:56.038 --> 15:57.707
you ruining your own health

15:57.749 --> 16:00.668
you are ruining the health of

15:57.749 --> 16:00.668
innocent people all around you.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.295
And you, sir.

16:02.336 --> 16:05.172
You should take a drive through

16:02.336 --> 16:05.172
a car wash without your car.

16:06.925 --> 16:08.217
It was nice meeting you both.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.184
Hello, Jess.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.355
Hi, pumpkin.

16:22.982 --> 16:23.983
What are you doing here?

16:24.024 --> 16:26.152
I got your sweet little message.

16:26.193 --> 16:28.028
Oh, and you must

17:42.061 --> 17:44.605

17:42.061 --> 17:44.605
- Nine.

17:44.647 --> 17:46.733
- Queen, high.

17:44.647 --> 17:46.733
