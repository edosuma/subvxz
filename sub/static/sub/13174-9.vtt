WEBVTT

00:03.107 --> 00:05.738
Florence has been caught
stealing supplies.

00:05.960 --> 00:07.122
Well, well, well.

00:07.213 --> 00:08.399
Todd, Steve's gone insane.

00:08.539 --> 00:09.913
- I know.
- We have to get out of here.

00:09.994 --> 00:11.993
They're getting away!
What do we do now, Steve?

00:13.298 --> 00:15.174
- Holy shit!
- Oh, my God!

00:15.404 --> 00:16.667
Son of a bitch shot me!

00:16.958 --> 00:19.120
You need to connect with these people.

00:19.147 --> 00:21.656
- Danny, get away from me. - I'm not
gonna leave you. You're my friend.

00:21.756 --> 00:24.461
I am not your friend! We are
just stuck here together!

00:24.695 --> 00:25.719
Okay.

00:28.907 --> 00:32.743
Stupid Danny, stupid Steve,
stupid Diane from Toledo.

00:32.778 --> 00:35.879
I'll bet she's never
even been to Toledo.

00:35.914 --> 00:37.681
I've been to Toledo.

00:40.018 --> 00:41.752
Danny?

00:42.988 --> 00:44.521
Hello?!

00:44.557 --> 00:46.289
Who's there?!

00:46.325 --> 00:47.524
Show yourself!

00:47.560 --> 00:49.426
Danny, is that you?

00:49.462 --> 00:50.861
Steve!

00:51.964 --> 00:53.831
The devil?

00:56.369 --> 00:57.668
Oh, I'm sorry!

00:57.703 --> 00:59.403
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

00:59.438 --> 01:01.905
Oh, God! Oh, just kill me. Just kill me.

01:01.940 --> 01:04.007
I won't even fight back. I promise.

01:04.042 --> 01:05.409
I'll just lay down.

01:05.444 --> 01:08.311
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:12.017 --> 01:14.985
Rosa?

01:15.020 --> 01:17.755
Oh, my God!

01:17.790 --> 01:18.589
Hi!

01:23.278 --> 01:24.978
All right, hold up.

01:25.013 --> 01:26.546
All right, hold up!

01:26.582 --> 01:29.749
Can we just take a mo-moment
to catch our breath?

01:29.784 --> 01:32.486
- We can't catch our breath! He's...
He's trying to kill us! - Florence!

01:32.521 --> 01:34.754
The island's gone, all right?
We made it!

01:34.789 --> 01:37.591
Some of us are rowing with
a friggin' gunshot wound.

01:37.626 --> 01:40.160
- Let me look at it. - No, no, no.
You're sick. That's okay.

01:40.195 --> 01:41.361
It's fine. I'm okay.

01:41.396 --> 01:43.130
No, no, no. You're, like, sick.

01:43.165 --> 01:44.498
You look insane. No, don't touch me!

01:46.602 --> 01:48.034
Oh, my God. It's just a graze.

01:48.069 --> 01:49.236
"It's just a graze?"

01:49.271 --> 01:50.770
It's a deep graze, foot doctor.

01:50.805 --> 01:52.772
We aren't gonna make it, okay?

01:52.807 --> 01:54.541
We barely have any food.

01:54.576 --> 01:57.110
We have no sail.

01:57.146 --> 01:58.612
We're gonna die out here.

01:58.647 --> 02:00.347
Hey, hey. Look at me.

02:00.382 --> 02:03.416
You built this, and we're
currently not dying on it.

02:03.452 --> 02:06.520
You saved my life.

02:06.555 --> 02:08.555
Thank you.

02:08.590 --> 02:11.525
I love you.

02:15.664 --> 02:18.365
Jess boned Chet?

02:18.400 --> 02:20.300
Really? Come on, buddy.

02:20.335 --> 02:21.535
Is he hotter than me?

02:21.570 --> 02:23.036
Yes! 1 million percent.

02:24.573 --> 02:27.274
I thought you were dead.

02:27.309 --> 02:29.142
I thought you were dead.

02:29.178 --> 02:30.644
I mean, even if you survived the crash,

02:30.679 --> 02:32.479
I figured you'd die almost immediately.

02:32.514 --> 02:35.715
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- We thought we were all alone.

02:35.750 --> 02:38.518
- We? - Oh, yeah, no, there's a
whole camp of us back there.

02:38.554 --> 02:40.520
Wait a minute. Are there more of you?

02:40.556 --> 02:42.088
Yeah.

02:42.123 --> 02:44.257
There's like... Like
on the other side...

02:44.293 --> 02:46.593
The whole th... Yeah.
You look so healthy!

02:46.628 --> 02:48.828
- Really?
- Yes.

02:48.863 --> 02:50.530
I mean, 'cause there's literally no way

02:50.566 --> 02:52.566
for me to see my reflection
back at camp, you know,

02:52.601 --> 02:57.571
so sometimes I feel like a
...like a crazy person.

02:57.606 --> 02:59.772
No, no, no, no. You look...

03:01.076 --> 03:03.610
- Do you have food?
- We do, we do. We have tons of it.

03:03.645 --> 03:05.812
- Do you have water?
- Yeah, river runs right next to camp.

03:05.847 --> 03:07.447
- Shut up.
- But, you know, when I say "camp,"

03:07.482 --> 03:09.082
I don't want you to get
the wrong idea, okay?

03:09.117 --> 03:10.750
It's very comfortable, it is,

03:10.785 --> 03:13.720
but back there, the focus
is getting off the island.

03:13.755 --> 03:16.523
That's what I've been saying.
That's my whole thing.

03:17.759 --> 03:20.193
Let's get you back there, big guy.

03:20.229 --> 03:21.794
Oh! This is fantastic.

03:27.236 --> 03:29.102
Shit. Emma?

03:30.805 --> 03:32.372
Todd, wake up! Emma!

03:32.407 --> 03:33.640
What? What's up?

03:33.675 --> 03:35.508
- What's wrong?
- Emma's gone!

03:35.544 --> 03:37.344
Emma! Emma!

03:37.379 --> 03:39.446
Where's the food? Where
the hell's the food?

03:39.481 --> 03:41.214
Food! Food!

03:41.250 --> 03:43.149
- Emma!
- Oh, God.

03:43.184 --> 03:45.552
- Oh, there's the bag!
- Oh, my God. There she is!

03:45.587 --> 03:46.853
What the shit?

03:46.888 --> 03:48.855
Emma! Are you okay?

03:48.890 --> 03:51.190
- What?
- What?

03:51.226 --> 03:54.160
- What?
- We're coming to get you!

03:54.195 --> 03:56.529
You're coming to get me, right?

03:56.565 --> 03:58.665
Okay, we... we need to
paddle towards her.

03:58.700 --> 04:00.367
With what? The oars are gone!

04:00.402 --> 04:02.636
- Shit!
- Shit!

04:02.671 --> 04:05.272
I'm going for her. You go for the food.

04:05.307 --> 04:06.606
Wait. Wait, wait. Take the rope!

04:06.642 --> 04:07.840
God, you weigh so much more than me.

04:07.876 --> 04:09.276
It's making this really hard.

04:09.311 --> 04:10.477
- All right, then go first!
- Okay!!

04:10.512 --> 04:11.878
- Go first!
- I will!!

04:11.913 --> 04:13.647
Emma, I'm coming!

04:13.682 --> 04:16.548
Food, I'm coming!

04:24.626 --> 04:27.226
Oh, my God. The rope is too short!

04:27.262 --> 04:29.462
Emma!

04:29.498 --> 04:31.298
- Florence!
- The rope's too short!

04:31.333 --> 04:34.567
Food! Food! The line's not long enough!

04:34.603 --> 04:36.569
It's okay.

04:36.605 --> 04:38.738
I'll be fine. Go back!

04:38.774 --> 04:40.840
Emma!

04:40.875 --> 04:42.676
Food!

04:42.711 --> 04:44.477
No!

04:44.513 --> 04:46.613
I'm okay!

04:46.648 --> 04:48.848
I'm sorry!

04:48.883 --> 04:51.384
I'm sorry!

04:51.420 --> 04:52.852
Food!

04:55.424 --> 04:56.923
I'm so sorry.

04:56.958 --> 04:58.858
Stay delicious!

04:58.893 --> 05:00.694
I'll find you!

05:00.729 --> 05:03.196
I'll find you, food.

05:11.239 --> 05:13.506
Steve sounds like a real dick.

05:13.542 --> 05:14.741
I know, right?

05:14.776 --> 05:16.710
I swear to God, it's that accent.

05:16.745 --> 05:18.345
He can get away with murder.

05:18.380 --> 05:20.447
He could be like, "Hey, I'm Steve.

05:20.482 --> 05:23.216
How are you? Here's a knife.
Go kill yourself. I'm Steve."

05:23.251 --> 05:24.651
Oh, he's cockney?

05:24.686 --> 05:26.319
I'm trying to do New Zealand.

05:26.355 --> 05:27.887
Yeah, well, back at our camp,

05:27.922 --> 05:29.589
we all make decisions together.

05:29.624 --> 05:31.558
- No one woman rules everyone.
- Really?

05:31.593 --> 05:33.493
And you're okay with that?

05:33.528 --> 05:35.729
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

05:35.764 --> 05:37.930
Because you're the person who paid

05:37.966 --> 05:41.634
to have "Head Flight Attendant"
embroidered on your uniform.

05:41.670 --> 05:43.570
I did not pay to have it embroidered.

05:44.939 --> 05:46.706
I did that myself.

05:46.742 --> 05:49.242
If being stranded on this
island has taught me one thing,

05:49.277 --> 05:51.911
it's that... you can't do it alone.

05:51.946 --> 05:54.013
People need people.

05:54.048 --> 05:57.751
So, anyway, here we are.

05:57.786 --> 05:59.386
It's right through there.

05:59.421 --> 06:03.823
All right, that's fine.

06:03.859 --> 06:05.425
Guys!

06:05.460 --> 06:08.895
There's someone I want
to introduce you to.

06:08.930 --> 06:11.564
Everyone, this is Owen.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.300
Owen, this is everyone.

06:16.000 --> 06:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:24.640 --> 06:28.839
Okay, and then we have Lloyd,
Charlie, Cooper and Miles,

06:29.019 --> 06:30.153
and then we have Britney.

06:30.354 --> 06:31.689
So, Britney, now that we have company,

06:31.789 --> 06:33.473
maybe you want to put some clothes on.

06:34.546 --> 06:35.441
I'm kidding!

06:36.000 --> 06:36.529
I'm... You guys, I'm kidding!

06:36.564 --> 06:39.732
- She's gonna make a pass at you,
so just know that. - Got it.

06:39.767 --> 06:42.901
Okay, so, everyone, I'd like for
you to make Owen feel welcome.

06:47.041 --> 06:48.641
Not all at once.

06:48.676 --> 06:49.942
Come on, guys.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.444
One at a time.

06:51.479 --> 06:52.911
Sebastian. Yeah.

06:54.549 --> 06:56.616
I'm gonna let Owen answer that, okay?

06:56.651 --> 06:58.951
So, Owen, you want to
...you got the floor.

07:00.855 --> 07:03.389
What?

07:03.424 --> 07:05.424
Okay, well, they want to know

07:05.460 --> 07:07.460
why you're the only one here.

07:07.495 --> 07:08.861
- I had a...
- To them.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.829
...falling out with my camp.

07:10.865 --> 07:13.466
Oh, my God! Okay. Stop it.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.535
Phil, he's not a troublemaker.

07:15.570 --> 07:18.704
Javier, Owen is not here
to "steal our women."

07:18.739 --> 07:21.574
And by the way, Britney, Vanessa, and I

07:21.609 --> 07:24.443
can take care of ourselves,
thank you very much.

07:24.479 --> 07:25.678
Look.

07:25.713 --> 07:28.847
Owen is not here to do us any harm,

07:28.883 --> 07:33.519
and even if he were, we'd
take care of it, okay?

07:33.555 --> 07:35.354
You know, I don't really
want to cause any trouble,

07:35.390 --> 07:36.789
so I think I'm just gonna go.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.891
What? Where you gonna go?

07:38.926 --> 07:41.561
- Just gonna go back to my camp.
- I thought they banished you, though.

07:41.596 --> 07:42.761
They did. They did.

07:42.797 --> 07:44.363
But it was a short banishment, so...

07:44.399 --> 07:46.832
Okay. Well, then, we'll go with you.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.901
- I don't even know how you could
- Why can't we go with you?

07:48.936 --> 07:50.769
You can bring everybody.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.807
You can bring Britney and
Javier and the whole gang.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.008
Great.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.610
But you know what? Listen.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.111
Let's just sleep on it, okay?

07:59.146 --> 08:01.046
So you'll... you'll spend the night.

08:01.082 --> 08:02.548
Carl.

08:02.584 --> 08:04.483
Inappropriate.

08:04.519 --> 08:06.419
So, you'll spend the night?

08:06.454 --> 08:08.087
I don't see a problem with that.

08:08.122 --> 08:10.889
Great. Slumber party.

08:13.135 --> 08:15.201
Josh.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.300
She's gone.

08:20.335 --> 08:21.802
I killed my best friend.

08:21.837 --> 08:22.704
Stop it.

08:22.714 --> 08:24.357
Stop that. You're gonna make me cry.

08:24.893 --> 08:25.806
She's never coming...

08:26.108 --> 08:28.018
I never should have
made her come out here.

08:28.118 --> 08:29.408
She's dead because of me.

08:30.416 --> 08:32.616
At least you tried to save her.

08:32.652 --> 08:35.385
I left the love of my life on an island

08:35.421 --> 08:37.121
with a homicidal maniac!

08:37.157 --> 08:38.322
Yeah, that's true.

08:38.357 --> 08:40.258
That is worse.

08:40.293 --> 08:43.427
Well... it's not worse.

08:43.462 --> 08:46.931
I mean... you killed your best friend

08:46.967 --> 08:49.067
by putting her on the shitty raft.

08:49.102 --> 08:51.502
I had no choice because she has Mengshu,

08:51.537 --> 08:53.104
but you just left Jess.

08:53.140 --> 08:54.639
Alive. I left her alive.

08:54.674 --> 08:56.074
So, it's different.

08:56.109 --> 08:58.442
Steve's probably gonna kill her, so...

08:58.478 --> 08:59.944
Yeah.

08:59.980 --> 09:02.513
But he won't 'cause, you know,

09:02.548 --> 09:04.983
she's so hot and Asian...

09:05.018 --> 09:07.051
and little and curvy.

09:08.421 --> 09:12.991
But Emma is like 100% dead, so...

09:14.594 --> 09:16.627
So, you know, that's... you
know, that's way worse.

09:16.663 --> 09:19.597
It's way, way, way worse.

09:19.632 --> 09:23.168
You're such a dick.

09:27.307 --> 09:28.973
Good, right?

09:29.083 --> 09:31.183
D'Angelo caught these.

09:32.637 --> 09:33.642
How?

09:34.021 --> 09:36.121
Fishing.

09:37.617 --> 09:38.957
Okay.

09:38.993 --> 09:39.333
Tell me something.

09:39.482 --> 09:42.561
How did you guys... find each other?

09:42.597 --> 09:44.029
Did you crash together?

09:44.064 --> 09:45.230
No, no.

09:45.266 --> 09:46.632
I was in the tail end of the plane.

09:46.668 --> 09:48.100
Only survivor.

09:48.135 --> 09:52.104
And it was just me out there
for... wow... about a month.

09:52.139 --> 09:54.640
Yeah. And I found this crew.

09:55.976 --> 09:57.810
And how'd that happen?

09:57.845 --> 09:59.679
Javier found me.

09:59.714 --> 10:03.215
I'm just... I'm so grateful.

10:06.220 --> 10:07.886
Yeah.

10:07.922 --> 10:10.523
And then everybody else just kind of...
showed up.

10:10.558 --> 10:12.591
Yeah. Hard to believe, isn't it? Right.

10:12.627 --> 10:13.793
Yeah.

10:13.828 --> 10:15.127
Yeah.

10:15.162 --> 10:17.730
I think that's because they're not...

10:19.567 --> 10:21.500
real.

10:21.536 --> 10:23.569
What are you talking about?

10:23.604 --> 10:26.205
Well, Rosa, these aren't people, right?

10:26.240 --> 10:29.508
I mean, that's a dog
crate with a face on it.

10:29.544 --> 10:31.811
That's a can of Pringles.

10:31.846 --> 10:34.179
I don't get it.

10:35.750 --> 10:38.150
Okay, maybe this will help.

10:38.185 --> 10:39.785
Hey, Roger. That's Julius.

10:39.821 --> 10:41.119
Right. Julius.

10:41.155 --> 10:42.788
Toss me that fish.

10:42.824 --> 10:45.090
See?

10:45.125 --> 10:46.826
Well, I mean, he's eating that, so...

10:46.861 --> 10:49.194
Yeah. Okay, sure. Hey,
Britney, throw me something.

10:50.565 --> 10:52.531
No? Nothing? Okay.

10:52.567 --> 10:53.899
Vanessa? Hans?

10:53.934 --> 10:55.568
Marco? Lloyd?

10:56.771 --> 10:58.303
You're scaring them.

10:58.339 --> 11:00.038
Okay, see, but that's the thing, Rosa.

11:00.074 --> 11:01.907
There is no "them."

11:01.942 --> 11:03.942
It's just you and me.

11:05.613 --> 11:08.180
- Shut up.
- What?

11:08.215 --> 11:09.582
- Shut up!
- Hey, hey!

11:09.617 --> 11:11.316
- Shut up.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:11.352 --> 11:12.718
- You just shut your goddamn mouth.
- Easy, easy.

11:12.754 --> 11:13.919
- Get back.
- Okay.

11:13.954 --> 11:15.287
- Get back!
- Okay, okay.

11:15.322 --> 11:17.256
Get... You get back! You get back!

11:17.291 --> 11:19.625
Owen, I am sorry, but
you're talking crazy

11:19.660 --> 11:21.560
and I got to protect my people here.

11:21.596 --> 11:23.228
Okay, listen to me. Listen to me.

11:23.264 --> 11:25.230
Why don't we just remember our
in-flight emergency training?

11:25.266 --> 11:26.732
Okay, we're gonna breathe in.

11:27.968 --> 11:29.234
And out.

11:29.270 --> 11:31.303
We're gonna breathe in.

11:31.338 --> 11:32.705
And out.

11:32.740 --> 11:34.239
- It's just you and me.
- And them!

11:34.275 --> 11:35.808
And them. And them. And them.

11:35.843 --> 11:37.209
Listen to me.

11:37.244 --> 11:42.247
You have suffered an
extraordinary trauma, all right?

11:42.283 --> 11:44.884
You have been alone
for a very long time.

11:44.919 --> 11:46.084
I get it.

11:49.690 --> 11:51.924
I am. I am.

11:51.959 --> 11:54.159
I am crazy.

11:54.194 --> 11:56.128
I'm a crazy lady. I'm a crazy...

11:56.163 --> 11:58.597
I am... I'm cra... I'm cra... I'm crazy.

11:58.633 --> 12:02.134
You're not... like, totally crazy.

12:03.771 --> 12:07.005
I know they're not real.

12:07.041 --> 12:10.776
It's just that it was just
me for so many weeks.

12:10.812 --> 12:12.711
Yeah. Oh, and I get it.
I totally get it.

12:12.747 --> 12:15.280
It was just like it's been so
long since I've seen someone.

12:15.316 --> 12:18.216
- Right.
- Or talked to someone.

12:18.252 --> 12:19.618
Right.

12:19.654 --> 12:23.789
Or since I've... touched someone.

12:25.225 --> 12:26.391
Okay, Rosa, I...

12:26.427 --> 12:29.294
No, I don't want to be alone anymore.

12:40.902 --> 12:42.068
Oh, God.

12:42.103 --> 12:44.337
I am so seasick. Oh, God.

12:44.372 --> 12:46.138
Oh, I feel terrible.

12:46.174 --> 12:48.641
You want to have sex?

12:48.677 --> 12:50.276
What?

12:50.312 --> 12:52.712
Well, Jess doesn't give a shit.

12:52.747 --> 12:56.249
We're probably gonna die out
here, so I just figured...

12:56.284 --> 12:58.884
Yeah, okay.

12:58.920 --> 13:01.120
Really? Oh, hell, yeah.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.788
Oh. Oh, yeah.

13:02.824 --> 13:05.157
Oh, you're gonna like it.

13:05.193 --> 13:07.159
Oh, dude.

13:07.195 --> 13:09.762
Yeah, it smells a little, but...

13:09.797 --> 13:11.163
Oh, my God.

13:11.199 --> 13:12.965
You look... I think it's gonna heal.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.934
- You look terrible.
- Oh, hold on.

13:14.969 --> 13:16.202
- Jesus Christ.
- Just give me...

13:16.238 --> 13:17.604
- Here we go.
- Okay.

13:17.639 --> 13:19.205
- No, hold on.
- Hold on.

13:19.241 --> 13:21.874
Give me a second. Give me a second.

13:23.911 --> 13:25.077
All right.

13:25.113 --> 13:26.679
I'm ready. It's...

13:26.715 --> 13:28.314
Oh, God. Don't let me blow chunks.
Come on.

13:28.350 --> 13:30.650
- Okay.
- Just...

13:30.685 --> 13:32.885
- Deep breath in. - If you just start
touching me, I think you would help me.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.320
- Okay.
- Oh, my God!

13:34.356 --> 13:35.788
- Look! It's fire!
- What?

13:35.823 --> 13:36.989
Oh, my God. That's land!

13:37.024 --> 13:39.259
No. I-I don't see any land.

13:39.294 --> 13:40.660
- There's... right there!
- Nope.

13:40.695 --> 13:41.961
- I don't see it.
- Oh, my God.

13:41.996 --> 13:43.263
I guess we should just get back to it.

13:43.298 --> 13:45.831
Get your stupid pineapple shirt on.

13:45.867 --> 13:48.301
Put that away. Let's start paddling.

13:49.837 --> 13:52.305
I'm so hard, though.

13:52.340 --> 13:54.106
- Are you?
- Not at all.

13:59.180 --> 14:03.849
Rosa?

14:06.053 --> 14:07.253
Oh, no, no, no.

14:07.289 --> 14:09.656
What was I supposed to do, Javier?

14:09.691 --> 14:11.324
I had to seduce him.

14:11.359 --> 14:14.026
I didn't have a choice, okay,
and don't you dare come at me

14:14.061 --> 14:15.795
after the shit you pulled
with Britney last week.

14:15.830 --> 14:17.797
Yeah, I saw you guys. I saw
you in the tall grass.

14:17.832 --> 14:19.399
You didn't really hide
yourselves too well.

14:19.434 --> 14:22.201
Yes, I'm talking to you,
Britney, you fucking bitch.

14:22.236 --> 14:23.770
Why don't you put a shirt
on for once in your life?

14:23.805 --> 14:24.970
Maybe try that out?

14:25.006 --> 14:26.839
O'Neill, god damn it, you're right.

14:26.874 --> 14:30.209
This is not the time for us
to be turning on each other.

14:31.979 --> 14:33.913
It is obvious that Owen has
gone completely insane.

14:33.948 --> 14:35.915
Okay? He doesn't think
you guys are real.

14:35.950 --> 14:37.317
He's dangerous.

14:37.352 --> 14:39.752
So, I think we all know
what we have to do.

14:39.788 --> 14:42.789
Everyone in favor of
murdering Owen in his sleep?

14:42.824 --> 14:44.256
Really, Derek? Oh.

14:44.292 --> 14:46.158
Oh, look at this guy, piping up.

14:46.194 --> 14:47.694
Now's the time you want to
get up on your high horse?

14:47.729 --> 14:48.894
Okay.

14:52.334 --> 14:54.801
- What the hell?
- Florence?

14:54.836 --> 14:56.035
Oh, my God. Owen?

14:56.070 --> 14:57.470
What... Owen, oh, my God.

14:57.505 --> 14:58.938
Are you kidding me?

14:58.973 --> 15:01.006
We landed on the same friggin' island?!

15:01.042 --> 15:03.443
- Keep your voices down!
- Owen, what's wrong?

15:03.478 --> 15:05.044
- There's somebody else here.
- What are you talking...

15:05.079 --> 15:06.746
There's somebody else on
the island from the crash.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.180
She's trying to kill me.

15:08.216 --> 15:10.750
- Why is she trying to kill you?
- Owen.

15:14.255 --> 15:17.223
Who are your friends?

15:17.258 --> 15:19.726
Well, well, well.

15:19.761 --> 15:21.894
Looks like Javier was right.

15:21.929 --> 15:23.295
So, what was your plan, Owen?

15:23.331 --> 15:25.297
Just wait till nightfall,
grab your friends,

15:25.333 --> 15:27.199
and then murder us all in our sleep?!

15:27.235 --> 15:28.501
Are there other people here?

15:28.536 --> 15:30.470
You drop the façade, bitch, okay?

15:30.505 --> 15:32.204
Derek, keep sights on her.

15:32.240 --> 15:35.441
How many more of you
are there out there?

15:35.477 --> 15:38.110
Listen to me. I had no
idea they were here.

15:38.145 --> 15:39.479
Liar!

15:39.514 --> 15:41.180
Liar!!

15:42.316 --> 15:45.418
How many more of you are there?

15:45.453 --> 15:46.819
It's just us!

15:46.855 --> 15:48.821
I mean, we came on a tiny raft!

15:48.857 --> 15:50.923
You have a raft?

15:50.958 --> 15:52.425
- Is it my raft? It floats?
- Barely.

15:52.460 --> 15:54.761
Oh, my God. Yes, I knew it.
I knew it was gonna work.

15:54.796 --> 15:55.961
I love my raft!

15:55.997 --> 15:57.497
- Shut up.
- Sorry.

15:57.532 --> 16:00.032
- Where is it?
- It's back there on the beach.

16:00.067 --> 16:02.234
Interesting.

16:02.270 --> 16:03.469
All right. Camp meeting.

16:03.505 --> 16:04.904
Everyone circle up.

16:04.939 --> 16:06.138
If you have to take a knee, do it.

16:06.173 --> 16:07.807
What is happening?

16:07.842 --> 16:09.308
Wait, why did you guys take the raft?

16:09.343 --> 16:10.510
Is... Is everyone okay?

16:10.545 --> 16:11.911
No, Steve's gone crazy.

16:11.946 --> 16:13.245
It's a hot mess over there.

16:13.281 --> 16:15.180
Dude shot me right next to my six-pack.

16:15.216 --> 16:17.450
I knew it. I knew Steve was bonkers.

16:17.485 --> 16:19.318
I am two for two right now.

16:19.353 --> 16:21.521
And I'm very sorry that you got shot.

16:21.556 --> 16:23.523
Whatever. Listen.

16:23.558 --> 16:25.291
There's a knife over there.

16:25.326 --> 16:27.860
I'm gonna inch towards it,
use it to cut my ropes.

16:27.896 --> 16:30.329
Then I'll roundhouse kick
her, probably into the fire,

16:30.364 --> 16:33.065
watch her burn for a bit,
then I'll come save you guys.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.500
Wait, wait, wait. Weren't you
with Danny? Where is he?

16:34.536 --> 16:35.968
Oh, he went back to the camp.

16:36.003 --> 16:37.303
He's...

16:38.973 --> 16:40.205
Oh, my God. Steve.

16:40.241 --> 16:41.908
If he finds him on the beach...

16:41.943 --> 16:43.409
Oh, yeah. He'll kill him, for
sure, probably skin him.

16:46.213 --> 16:47.379
Rosa.

16:47.415 --> 16:49.315
Rosa, you have got to let us go.

16:49.350 --> 16:50.917
We have to get back.

16:50.952 --> 16:52.284
Read a room, Owen!

16:52.320 --> 16:54.487
We're talking here! Rosa.

16:54.522 --> 16:56.188
You were right.

16:56.223 --> 17:02.562
People... need people,
and I see that now.

17:02.597 --> 17:05.364
I've got to get back. I
have got to help my friend.

17:05.398 --> 17:06.598
Please.

17:08.269 --> 17:11.436
Yeah.

17:11.473 --> 17:13.071
No fucking way.

17:13.107 --> 17:15.875
I'm gonna kill you, and
I'm gonna take your raft.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.076
What?

17:17.111 --> 17:18.644
Why wouldn't I kill them, Javier?

17:20.080 --> 17:25.284
You want us to keep them captive
on a raft so they can row?

17:25.319 --> 17:27.587
Fine! Fine. Fine.

17:27.622 --> 17:29.221
I don't need all of
them, so who do I kill?

17:30.625 --> 17:32.859
Rowing takes a lot of
upper-body strength,

17:32.894 --> 17:35.361
so anatomy-wise, probably want
to get rid of the little girl.

17:35.396 --> 17:37.630
Oh, my God. You little bitch.
He's the one who's been shot.

17:37.665 --> 17:40.165
- Nah, it's a graze. I didn't even
feel it. - It's a deep graze.

17:40.201 --> 17:42.067
No, no, no. I didn't feel nothing.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.903
I mean...

17:43.938 --> 17:46.171
Check these delts out! I got blessed!

17:46.207 --> 17:48.207
Tell me they wouldn't be an asset.

17:48.242 --> 17:50.175
Please don't kill me.

17:50.211 --> 17:51.911
Please, don't. I'm a pussy!

17:51.946 --> 17:53.412
I am a pussy. I can't die.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.280
Oh, God.

17:55.316 --> 17:57.316
I have three little kiddies
back at home waiting for Daddy.

17:57.351 --> 18:00.653
Oh, my God. Shut up or I'm
not gonna make it quick.

18:00.688 --> 18:02.989
What? What was that?
What was that "Hmmph?"

18:03.024 --> 18:04.323
Nothing. It's just, you know,

18:04.358 --> 18:06.225
I'm just not used to
seeing you take orders.

18:06.260 --> 18:07.493
What are you talking about?

18:07.529 --> 18:09.228
Oh, I'm just saying back
at Lotus, you know,

18:09.263 --> 18:11.463
you were the Head Flight Attendant.

18:11.499 --> 18:14.266
Now it seems like Javier's
running the show.

18:15.570 --> 18:17.503
We all make the decisions here, so, meh!

18:17.539 --> 18:19.539
Right, no, yeah. Yeah.

18:19.574 --> 18:21.407
I'd just say that here,

18:21.442 --> 18:24.343
Javier's the Head Flight Attendant.

18:26.414 --> 18:29.015
Oh, is it ridiculous, Javier?

18:29.050 --> 18:30.282
Is it?

18:30.317 --> 18:32.217
From the backseat, Javier pipes up.

18:32.253 --> 18:34.219
Okay! You've never respected me.

18:34.255 --> 18:35.454
Yeah, man.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.924
You don't respect her!

18:37.959 --> 18:40.593
Eat a bag of dicks, Javier!

18:42.530 --> 18:43.963
That was too much and I know that.
What is wrong with you?

18:43.998 --> 18:45.164
I'm sorry, that was a lot.

18:45.199 --> 18:47.066
I make the decisions.

18:47.101 --> 18:48.500
I... I make 'em.

18:48.536 --> 18:50.002
They all die.

18:50.038 --> 18:52.572
No! Wait a minute! Wait, wait, wait!

18:52.607 --> 18:56.141
And Javier is gonna kill 'em.

18:56.177 --> 18:59.178
No. Oh, why, Javier?

18:59.213 --> 19:02.147
I'm gonna go check out that
raft and see what's up,

19:02.183 --> 19:04.450
and when I come back, I want them dead.

19:06.654 --> 19:09.055
One more thing.

19:09.090 --> 19:12.124
You'd think I'd forget this?

19:12.159 --> 19:14.193
Just leave this here, accessible?

19:14.228 --> 19:16.528
Here. "Oh, yeah. Just leave it here."

19:16.564 --> 19:18.731
I'm not an idiot, okay?

19:18.766 --> 19:20.165
Sebastian.

19:21.202 --> 19:22.401
Use it.

19:22.436 --> 19:24.503
If they try anything, you yell.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.672
All right, Vaness? Okay.

19:27.742 --> 19:30.409
It's just a damn shame
'cause she's so hot.

19:30.444 --> 19:32.444
- She's so hot.
- Can you reach it?

19:36.254 --> 19:37.654
Well, yeah, I guess it's a raft.

19:37.689 --> 19:39.288
I'm shocked it even floats.

19:39.324 --> 19:41.023
Listen up.

19:41.059 --> 19:44.661
You try anything and I will stick
this right in his... neck.

19:44.696 --> 19:47.530
Higher. It's higher.

19:47.566 --> 19:49.432
Javier, baby, it's gonna be okay.
It is gonna be okay.

19:49.468 --> 19:53.093
There's one thing that
Owen has forgotten.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.481
You're outnumbered.

19:54.681 --> 19:56.347
Have you looked around?

19:56.547 --> 19:57.073
Get him!

20:00.905 --> 20:02.838
Guys.

20:04.243 --> 20:04.685
Oh. Oh, shoot!

20:06.188 --> 20:07.520
That was...

20:09.354 --> 20:11.286
- Okay. All right. Let's go.
- Okay.

20:11.322 --> 20:13.088
Let's get the hell out of here.

20:13.123 --> 20:14.657
Yeah, let's go.

20:14.692 --> 20:17.092
I got to go back for Danny.

20:17.127 --> 20:18.394
What?

20:18.429 --> 20:20.128
What are you talking about?

20:20.164 --> 20:22.365
If Crazy Pants wakes up, she'll kill us,

20:22.400 --> 20:24.233
and if she doesn't, Steve will.

20:24.268 --> 20:25.601
Okay, we have what we need now.

20:25.636 --> 20:27.503
We... Don't you want to
get off this island?

20:27.538 --> 20:31.340
He might be in trouble,
and it's my fault.

20:33.068 --> 20:35.735
And I'm gonna go back, too, for Emma.

20:38.706 --> 20:40.673
Yeah, all right. I'm obviously going.

20:40.708 --> 20:43.209
I'm not gonna be the only
douche bag who doesn't go.

20:43.245 --> 20:45.078
Okay.

20:45.113 --> 20:48.281
Let's go save this island.

20:50.152 --> 20:51.751
Yeah. Let's go save it.

20:51.786 --> 20:53.053
Let's go save it up.

20:53.088 --> 20:54.787
Let's go save, like, the whole island.

20:54.822 --> 20:56.322
I didn't say it like that.
I didn't say it like that.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.569
Let's go save this island.
I'm pretty sure...

20:57.604 --> 20:59.303
That sounds like Keanu Reeves.
I don't talk like that.

20:59.339 --> 21:00.739
Save this island. Let's
go save this island.

21:00.774 --> 21:02.194
That doesn't sound anything
like... Can we go?

21:11.305 --> 21:17.582
