00:05.750 --> 00:07.384
<i>Accessing archive data...</i>

00:07.451 --> 00:08.771
<i>Tron continues to encourage Beck.</i>

00:08.795 --> 00:11.120
This isn't a game, Beck.

00:11.155 --> 00:13.989
- You did pretty good up until then.
- Pretty good won't cut it.

00:14.023 --> 00:17.592
<i>Zed builds a light
cycle to impress Mara,</i>

00:17.626 --> 00:19.827
<i>but it impresses the renegade instead...</i>

00:19.862 --> 00:22.020
- Sorry about this.
- Hey! Hey!

00:22.055 --> 00:23.835
We could use someone like you.

00:23.870 --> 00:25.954
- For what?
- To stop the renegade.

00:25.990 --> 00:28.764
<i>...as Tesler spreads the
myth of Tron's demise.</i>

00:28.799 --> 00:30.685
Tron is dead.

00:30.719 --> 00:35.573
And I assure you this renegade
will be brought to justice!

00:40.950 --> 00:43.802
I'm flattered, but I like my privacy.

01:06.871 --> 01:09.417
<i>Please stand clear.</i>

01:09.451 --> 01:10.710
<i>Attention, programs.</i>

01:10.745 --> 01:17.264
<i>There has been a security breach.
Prepare your discs for scanning.</i>

01:17.299 --> 01:19.893
Oh, great.

01:24.106 --> 01:28.616
Hey, something tells me you don't want
these goons poking around your disc either.

01:28.650 --> 01:31.949
Nah, I'm just late for work.
I hope this doesn't take long.

01:31.984 --> 01:34.520
Yeah, right.

01:34.554 --> 01:37.760
Look, they don't need to see what
we're up to before we got here.

01:37.794 --> 01:39.667
Right?

01:39.701 --> 01:41.381
<i>Hey, you can't just
take my disc like that!</i>

01:41.405 --> 01:43.252
Stand down or you will get derezzed.

01:43.286 --> 01:45.197
Now's our chance. Follow me.

01:45.231 --> 01:46.537
<i>No!</i>

01:55.597 --> 01:59.465
<i>Next stop, Argon park.
Please stand clear.</i>

02:07.983 --> 02:11.529
Well, this is where we split up.

02:11.564 --> 02:12.675
Hey, thanks.

02:12.710 --> 02:13.710
<i>Next stop Purgos.</i>

02:14.668 --> 02:18.421
<i>This is an express line.
There will be no further stops.</i>

02:24.174 --> 02:25.254
He stole my disc!

02:26.289 --> 02:28.199
Way to go, Beck.

02:28.233 --> 02:30.531
You just lost everything.

02:33.046 --> 02:42.576
<b>S01E05 - Identity</b>

02:46.843 --> 02:50.579
- It doesn't work.
- That's because it's a fake.

02:50.614 --> 02:52.817
You need to wear something on your back.

02:52.851 --> 02:54.755
If you're spotted without a disk,

02:54.789 --> 02:59.560
Tesler's guards will pick you up
as a stray in no time.

02:59.595 --> 03:03.532
How long do I have before
I really do become a stray?

03:03.566 --> 03:07.536
Not long. You've already
lost valuable time.

03:07.570 --> 03:10.505
And if we don't get my disc back?

03:10.540 --> 03:12.407
Your memory will fade.

03:12.442 --> 03:15.677
Everything you've ever
seen or experienced...

03:15.712 --> 03:16.779
you'll forget.

03:16.813 --> 03:20.449
So I really screwed up.

03:20.483 --> 03:25.759
I've put you, my friends,
and the revolution in danger.

03:28.466 --> 03:30.601
Hey, by the way, this is the part

03:30.635 --> 03:33.437
where you're supposed
to cheer your friend up.

03:33.471 --> 03:35.706
I'd rather just get your disc back.

03:35.741 --> 03:40.577
Okay, so we're not friends.
Got it. Where do we start?

03:40.611 --> 03:43.514
There's a black market for stolen discs,

03:43.548 --> 03:45.582
but you can't go there alone...

03:45.617 --> 03:47.618
not in your condition.

03:47.652 --> 03:50.621
<i>I wonder if he's really
Tron like they're saying.</i>

03:50.655 --> 03:52.456
I actually kinda hope he isn't.

03:52.491 --> 03:54.759
I like his whole aura of mystery.

03:54.793 --> 03:58.597
Mystery? Yeah, right.
More like scared to show his face.

03:59.866 --> 04:03.602
Uh, what are they doing here?

04:07.474 --> 04:12.412
<i>Commander Paige's renegade
task force is operational.</i>

04:12.446 --> 04:15.581
This could be a big deal for
all of us if we catch him.

04:15.615 --> 04:18.651
- Yeah, about that...
- I want you to make a light cycle mod,

04:18.685 --> 04:21.587
a weapon that could stop
stop the renegade in a chase.

04:21.620 --> 04:24.423
You do that and this is yours.

04:25.892 --> 04:29.560
Look, I agree the renegade is
making things worse in Argon, but...

04:29.594 --> 04:32.564
What did I tell you? Waste of time.
I knew he didn't have the guts.

04:32.598 --> 04:34.799
The renegade stole your bike.

04:34.834 --> 04:37.836
Do you like being a laughing stock?

04:49.849 --> 04:52.650
<i>Wait... I'm in.</i>

04:57.922 --> 05:00.890
Pergos...
the original settlement of Argon.

05:00.925 --> 05:03.894
Before the war, this was a boom town.

05:03.928 --> 05:05.795
Now it's a garbage heap.

05:05.830 --> 05:08.731
You'll start with the pawn shops.

05:12.436 --> 05:14.737
<i>You didn't answer my question.</i>

05:14.772 --> 05:16.672
I'm not sure I heard it right.

05:16.706 --> 05:19.508
You're asking me
if I have identity discs?

05:19.543 --> 05:21.677
Real identity discs?

05:21.711 --> 05:24.547
<i>I know you have a
secret stash somewhere.</i>

05:24.581 --> 05:28.552
<i>Look, I don't know what you
think, but I run a clean shop here.</i>

05:28.586 --> 05:32.489
<i>If you want stolen goods,
you'll have to try elsewhere.</i>

05:32.524 --> 05:35.392
<i>Please. We've been to
three shops already.</i>

05:35.426 --> 05:36.727
<i>This is very important.</i>

05:36.761 --> 05:38.729
If you know anything,
you have to tell us.

05:38.763 --> 05:42.732
<i>I know
when I see a program in trouble.</i>

05:42.767 --> 05:44.734
<i>I'll help you.
Let me ask around.</i>

05:44.769 --> 05:46.469
We'll come with you.

05:46.504 --> 05:49.673
<i>Alone. Sorry,
that's just how it's gotta be.</i>

05:49.707 --> 05:52.842
There's an energy canteen around
the corner. I'll meet you there.

05:52.877 --> 05:56.779
<i>My name's Cobol.
You know, it's good you found me.</i>

05:56.814 --> 06:01.651
In Pergos, you can't trust anyone.

06:06.793 --> 06:09.428
- He was lying.
- You mean Cobol?

06:09.462 --> 06:12.431
The only solid lead
we've come up with so far?

06:12.465 --> 06:14.667
If it's a lead at all.

06:14.701 --> 06:16.502
Beck, in case we don't find your disc,

06:16.536 --> 06:18.671
I need to prepare you
for the memory loss.

06:18.705 --> 06:20.372
This should be fun.

06:20.407 --> 06:23.376
It's a glitch.
It comes without warning.

06:23.410 --> 06:26.050
One moment you're normal, the next
you're forgetting your own name.

06:26.074 --> 06:30.684
But you'll recover.
At least, the first few times.

06:30.718 --> 06:33.654
And after the first few times?

06:33.688 --> 06:37.792
Permanent amnesia.
You won't know who you are anymore.

06:37.826 --> 06:40.461
Well, it's not going to come to that.

06:40.495 --> 06:42.563
We're going to find the
program who did this to me

06:42.597 --> 06:44.799
and put him out of business.

06:44.833 --> 06:51.405
- Beck, we're being followed.
- You mean surrounded.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.441
Let me handle this.

06:53.475 --> 06:59.547
We didn't come here for trouble.
We're just passing through, that's all.

06:59.581 --> 07:04.552
You passed into our territory.
This street belongs to me...

07:04.586 --> 07:07.555
and you'll pay for trespassing.

07:42.592 --> 07:45.461
<i>What's going on? Where am I?</i>

07:45.495 --> 07:46.662
Take him.

08:06.442 --> 08:07.676
<i>Come on!</i>

08:09.845 --> 08:11.846
<i>Beck!</i>

08:18.622 --> 08:21.758
I think I just had my first glitch.

08:21.792 --> 08:24.594
We should keep moving.

08:24.628 --> 08:27.364
Oh. But I'm glad you care.

08:27.398 --> 08:29.833
Why'd you help us?

08:31.735 --> 08:36.605
Because you needed it.
You're welcome, by the way.

08:36.639 --> 08:40.409
- I'm Lux.
- Uh, I'm... I'm Beck.

08:40.443 --> 08:43.479
And this is, uh... my friend.

08:43.514 --> 08:45.781
- Huh?
- What? I'm improvising.

08:45.816 --> 08:48.617
I've seen programs
like you before, Beck.

08:48.652 --> 08:51.587
- What do you mean?
- Strays.

08:51.622 --> 08:53.489
I'm not a stray yet.

08:53.524 --> 08:58.395
Well, it's only a matter of time.
But I can help you.

08:58.430 --> 09:01.699
I know my way around Pergos.

09:01.983 --> 09:04.258
Ooh. If my memory's going,

09:04.386 --> 09:07.989
at least the last thing
I'll remember will be her.

09:08.023 --> 09:09.858
Focus, Beck.

09:15.435 --> 09:17.769
<i>You still haven't told
me what this is for.</i>

09:17.804 --> 09:22.407
Allow me to introduce my masterpiece.

09:23.643 --> 09:26.411
Eventually we'll put it
on the front of a cycle,

09:26.445 --> 09:30.615
but for our test right now,
this'll do.

09:49.439 --> 09:51.776
<i>It worked!</i>

09:55.682 --> 09:58.818
Okay, well, I checked
with all my contacts,

09:58.852 --> 10:01.587
and none of them have heard
of any stolen discs recently.

10:01.621 --> 10:03.489
And Cobol's a no-show.

10:03.523 --> 10:07.560
Beck, there's a program in the back
who seems awfully interested in you.

10:07.594 --> 10:09.696
He's been staring since we walked in.

10:09.730 --> 10:12.465
I think that's the
program who conned me.

10:12.499 --> 10:14.667
His name's Galt, a small-time thief.

10:23.780 --> 10:24.880
- Galt.
- No!

10:26.549 --> 10:28.517
I didn't get your name last time...

10:28.552 --> 10:30.653
when you were stealing my disc.

10:30.687 --> 10:32.855
I don't know what you're
talking about. W-what disc?

10:32.890 --> 10:34.624
Looks a lot like this one.

10:34.659 --> 10:37.894
Okay, I took it,
but I don't have it anymore.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.930
- I swear!
- Who'd you give it to?

10:39.964 --> 10:41.932
You think I'd tell you?

10:41.966 --> 10:44.701
He's not as polite as you two.

10:44.735 --> 10:46.870
Everyone's gonna know your secret.

11:35.654 --> 11:36.688
Beck!

11:40.726 --> 11:41.927
Pardon me.

11:41.961 --> 11:44.696
I'm sorry. Sorry.
Coming through!

11:57.611 --> 11:59.679
Beck, look out!

12:16.664 --> 12:18.804
Wow.
That could do a lot of damage.

12:18.838 --> 12:20.607
Isn't it great?!

12:22.544 --> 12:26.848
Oh, this is for your friends
Bartik and Hopper, isn't it?

12:26.882 --> 12:30.518
They're on a task force to hunt
the renegade, I'm trying to join.

12:30.553 --> 12:33.555
I know you think the renegade
is helping, but he's not.

12:33.589 --> 12:36.491
- This can stop him.
- Or worse.

12:36.525 --> 12:38.860
Zed, this could derez him.

12:38.895 --> 12:42.564
I'm... I'm just
trying to do the right thing.

12:42.598 --> 12:46.902
I didn't think you were
like Bartik and Hopper, Zed,

12:46.936 --> 12:52.975
but if joining their task force
is what you want, best of luck.

12:57.847 --> 13:01.551
Nice place. How'd you get it?

13:01.585 --> 13:04.721
I have my ways.

13:04.756 --> 13:07.725
Without your disc,
this is the best I can do.

13:11.930 --> 13:14.732
Learn anything from Galt's disc?

13:14.766 --> 13:17.568
He was scum, which is hardly news.

13:17.603 --> 13:20.705
I did find the memory
where he robbed you.

13:20.739 --> 13:24.709
- Who is that?
- Beck, it's you.

13:24.743 --> 13:28.513
- What am I doing there?
- You are fighting a revolution.

13:28.547 --> 13:31.883
- What revolution?
- Beck, stay with me.

13:31.917 --> 13:34.235
<i>Who's Beck? Who are you?</i>

13:34.236 --> 13:36.554
<i>Why are you hiding your face?</i>

13:36.589 --> 13:38.723
<i>Beck!</i>

13:40.824 --> 13:43.788
It's okay. It's okay.

13:43.822 --> 13:46.586
Everything will be clear soon.

13:46.620 --> 13:48.617
<i>We're here to help you.</i>

13:48.652 --> 13:49.652
We?

13:51.617 --> 13:58.755
I told you...
don't trust anyone.

14:07.100 --> 14:08.934
His helmet won't come off.

14:08.968 --> 14:12.837
Forget that, he's nothing. We
have bigger things to worry about.

14:12.872 --> 14:14.039
See that light?

14:14.073 --> 14:17.175
That's where your
friends are gonna meet us.

14:17.209 --> 14:19.010
We're taking you back home.

14:19.044 --> 14:23.181
Beck! That is an emergency
beacon to summon the military!

14:23.215 --> 14:25.884
They're turning you in
to the occupation!

14:25.918 --> 14:28.920
I'm part of the military.
Cobol told me.

14:28.955 --> 14:31.756
<i>Beck, no! He is lying to you!</i>

14:31.791 --> 14:35.793
<i>Don't listen to him. You're
an officer in Tesler's army.</i>

14:35.828 --> 14:40.798
You just lost your disc. If you go
back with Cobol, you'll get it back.

14:40.832 --> 14:43.768
<i>Oh, she's lying to you, Beck!
They both are!</i>

14:43.802 --> 14:45.937
Enough!

14:45.971 --> 14:48.940
If you derez him, you
could lose Beck's trust.

14:48.974 --> 14:51.142
How dare you question me!

14:53.111 --> 14:55.113
Watch him until I get back.

14:56.882 --> 14:59.117
<i>Lux, you have to let me go!</i>

14:59.151 --> 15:01.986
Cobol's taking Beck to be derezzed!

15:02.021 --> 15:05.726
No, repurposed.

15:05.761 --> 15:09.871
My job was to follow you
until Beck forgot who he was.

15:09.906 --> 15:15.854
Then he'd be easier to take.
And it worked.

15:15.888 --> 15:19.025
Free me. Your own life is in danger.

15:19.060 --> 15:23.096
Cobol derezzed Galt.
He almost derezzed me.

15:23.130 --> 15:25.098
Soon it'll be your turn.

15:25.132 --> 15:28.068
Mm-mm. No, you're wrong.

15:28.102 --> 15:32.973
Cobol would never hurt me.
He loves me.

15:34.109 --> 15:36.844
Who is it you're trying to convince?

15:49.959 --> 15:53.963
<i>This thing better be lethal.
We stuck our necks out for you.</i>

15:53.997 --> 15:56.131
It's a killer all right.

15:56.166 --> 15:59.001
- Sorry I'm late.
- What's she doing here?

15:59.036 --> 16:02.272
This program claims she's
assisting the demonstration.

16:05.209 --> 16:09.112
She just did.
I'm really glad you're here, Mara.

16:09.146 --> 16:11.882
<i>I'm on a tight schedule,
so let's cut to the chase.</i>

16:11.916 --> 16:14.785
You brought me here for
a new light cycle mod?

16:14.819 --> 16:17.220
A weapon, actually. Um...

16:17.255 --> 16:20.157
I have to make one
quick adjustment first.

16:26.999 --> 16:28.799
Whoa!

16:30.269 --> 16:33.972
Oops. Guess it still needs work.

16:34.006 --> 16:36.808
You're a joke. And you two...

16:36.843 --> 16:39.811
whose idea was it to waste
my time with this imbecile?

16:39.846 --> 16:40.979
- All Hopper.
- Hopper?!

16:41.013 --> 16:42.113
- Yes.
- No, not Hopper!

16:42.148 --> 16:45.917
Thanks, that was a real blast.

16:53.826 --> 16:58.063
There they are, Beck.
You'll be home soon.

16:58.097 --> 17:01.900
Back away from him, Cobol.

17:05.172 --> 17:07.906
Is this the disc you're looking for?

17:30.963 --> 17:31.963
Who are you?

17:47.045 --> 17:49.046
Derez him! He's the enemy!

17:52.873 --> 17:55.170
<i>Do it! I command you!</i>

17:56.171 --> 17:58.138
<i>I know you're still there, Beck.</i>

17:58.173 --> 18:02.809
<i>The memory loss hasn't taken all of you.</i>

18:02.843 --> 18:05.010
<i>Killing is not your way.</i>

18:09.815 --> 18:10.882
Tron.

18:13.118 --> 18:14.886
Tron lives.

18:14.920 --> 18:18.956
Beck, this is about
more than the uprising.

18:18.990 --> 18:21.124
You're my friend.

18:21.158 --> 18:24.894
I didn't say it before
because I didn't think I could,

18:24.928 --> 18:29.164
but that was wrong of me.
We are friends.

18:29.198 --> 18:32.200
Be who you are.

18:32.234 --> 18:34.935
You don't need your memories for that.

18:34.970 --> 18:38.004
What are you doing?!
You work for Tesler!

18:38.038 --> 18:41.140
I'm not a killer.
I don't derez programs.

18:41.174 --> 18:45.109
Too bad... because I do.

18:47.045 --> 18:49.947
I thought I had something
with the renegade,

18:49.981 --> 18:52.015
but now I've got Tron!

18:56.253 --> 18:59.054
Beck, your disc!

19:06.161 --> 19:09.730
Guess what? I'm back.

19:20.739 --> 19:23.006
- We should go.
- We can't just leave Cobol here.

19:23.040 --> 19:26.175
- He knows your identity.
- Then we bring him with us.

19:26.210 --> 19:31.980
Bring me where, renegade?

19:42.756 --> 19:45.991
You being alive changes everything.

19:46.026 --> 19:48.827
If I had only known earlier...

19:54.166 --> 19:57.902
Look, we...
we can't let them get to you.

19:57.936 --> 20:00.804
Take Cobol's disc. Destroy it.

20:00.839 --> 20:03.173
I'll hold them off.

20:03.207 --> 20:08.744
- The disc. No!
- She wants us to escape, Beck.

20:08.778 --> 20:10.945
<i>No! Lux!</i>

20:46.143 --> 20:48.977
She sacrificed herself to save us.

20:49.012 --> 20:52.247
That's who Lux really was...

20:52.282 --> 20:54.015
a hero.

20:55.250 --> 20:57.852
She also became a friend.

20:59.053 --> 21:01.121
I remember what you
said to me back there.

21:01.155 --> 21:04.790
Got a little emotional, huh?

21:04.824 --> 21:08.893
Don't worry, I won't
hold it against you.

21:08.927 --> 21:11.962
A long time ago,
I misjudged someone.

21:11.996 --> 21:14.030
Clu?

21:14.065 --> 21:17.967
I let friendship cloud judgment...

21:18.002 --> 21:20.736
and paid a heavy price.

21:20.771 --> 21:23.905
But I didn't misjudge you, Beck.

21:23.940 --> 21:26.774
With you, I chose well.
