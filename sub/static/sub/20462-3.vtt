out of my scrotum--

11:04.121 --> 11:05.706
Hey. It's a psychic.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.294
-Where did I lose you, at cut scrotum?
-We should go in there.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.713
Really? It's kind of a scam,
don't you think?

11:12.797 --> 11:14.423
It's totally a scam.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.176
Okay, as long as you know.

11:20.137 --> 11:20.971
[Sophia] Yes.

11:24.809 --> 11:27.019
Okay, so, the way this works best

11:27.103 --> 11:29.605
is for you to be open to the fact
that I have a gift.

11:29.688 --> 11:31.774
And do not look for proof
or evidence that I don't.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.359
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm.

11:33.442 --> 11:36.112
What areas of your life are you looking
to focus on today?

11:36.320 --> 11:40.366
Well, Sophia here wants to know
if she should join the Navy.

11:40.449 --> 11:43.035
And I keep telling her,
"Girl, you get seasick."

11:43.119 --> 11:45.162
Oh, dear, you're not funny.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.374
-I know why you're here.
-Oh, you do?

11:48.457 --> 11:50.042
Mm-hmm. Yes.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.838
Oh. I'm getting a very strong feeling
from you.

11:54.630 --> 11:57.758
You're on the precipice.
You're feeling something, and it's--

11:58.175 --> 12:00.344
It could be big,
but you're not sure what it is.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.930
Yes, awesome!
Okay, is there a specific name?

12:03.013 --> 12:05.015
Something that describes me or my soul?

12:05.099 --> 12:07.601
Hopefully, one or two words
that could fit into a URL?

12:07.685 --> 12:11.605
No, he doesn't really work in specifics
like that. It's just more of feeling--

12:11.689 --> 12:14.358
That's true
and I'm also not feeling you right now.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.694
And yes, I am getting--

12:16.777 --> 12:19.280
Oh, no, it's a feeling of chaos.

12:19.363 --> 12:20.990
-[Sophia] Whoa.
-Upheaval, even.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.576
-Okay, from him or me, or--?
-It's everywhere.

12:24.034 --> 12:26.495
-It's all around us.
-But is there a specific name?

12:26.579 --> 12:29.790
-Like he said, it's more of a feeling.
-Police. Everybody down.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.792
-Shit, hit the deck!
-[Sophia yells]

12:31.876 --> 12:32.835
[man] Shit!

12:33.335 --> 12:34.587
[man 2] Put your hands up!

12:35.087 --> 12:37.214
-Let's get out of here.
-But the police said--

12:37.298 --> 12:38.174
[Sophia] Fuck the police.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.104
Oh, my God.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.814
[laughing]

12:53.898 --> 12:56.859
-Holy crap.
-Yeah. That was crazy.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.110
The place was a front?

12:58.194 --> 13:00.988
-I can't believe we didn't shit ourselves.
-Came close.

13:01.614 --> 13:05.284
-Wait, you took the wine.
-Yeah, I had to. My DNA was all over it.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.413
All right.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.292
Well, what next?

13:14.627 --> 13:15.711
You tell me.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.348
Try this.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.141
The best in the city.

13:33.437 --> 13:35.606
Whoa, big bite!

13:35.981 --> 13:38.817
You know, I thought with that weak chin,
it'd be half that.

13:39.026 --> 13:41.278
-My chin is 90 degrees.
-Mm-hmm.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.948
-Architects stop me in the street.
-[laughs]

13:44.281 --> 13:45.866
-You're ridiculous.
-They do.

13:46.450 --> 13:47.660
You know what's weird?

13:48.994 --> 13:50.788
I don't know what you do for a living.

13:50.996 --> 13:54.333
That's actually not weird. You've yet
to ask a single question about me.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.794
Touché, okay.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.673
-So, what do you do?
-I don't like talking about myself.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.509
Are you being serious?

14:04.510 --> 14:05.886
I manage bands.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.847
Indie bands mostly,
people you've never heard of.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.849
Damn, Shane!

14:11.684 --> 14:12.893
That sounds cool.

14:13.477 --> 14:16.564
You'd think, but mainly,
it's answering a thousand e-mails

14:16.647 --> 14:18.482
from neurotic musicians every day

14:18.566 --> 14:20.860
who are pissed off
they're not The Strokes.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.444
-[chuckles] Okay.
-Yeah.

14:23.028 --> 14:23.863
So, it's not fun?

14:24.321 --> 14:28.117
Honestly, it's hard, it's long hours,
I'm on the road a lot.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.537
It's kind of the reason
my relationship imploded.

14:31.620 --> 14:32.496
Mm.

14:32.580 --> 14:36.000
-Crusty don't like indie rock?
-Oh, no. Crusty love indie rock.

14:36.458 --> 14:39.128
Katie, on the other hand,
my actual ex-girlfriend,

14:39.753 --> 14:41.797
had a big problem with my job.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.048
Why?

14:43.382 --> 14:46.552
She wasn't into you being chased around
by groupies all the time?

14:46.635 --> 14:49.096
Actually, yes. She was very jealous.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.308
Did you give her a reason to be jealous?

14:52.933 --> 14:53.767
Yeah.

14:54.935 --> 14:57.771
-Yeah, mistakes were made. Yeah, I mean--
-Yeah.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.107
Yeah. No, that's on me. That sucks.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.442
I-- Yeah.

15:03.068 --> 15:06.196
You know, it's none of my business,
but it sounds like you...

15:06.614 --> 15:08.949
are the reason your relationship imploded.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.201
That's fair. Yeah.

15:12.536 --> 15:14.705
What about you?
You ever cheat on anybody?

15:14.997 --> 15:17.207
No, that's shitty.
That's what bad people do.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.209
Let's get on the trolley without paying.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.213
[Sophia whooping]

15:23.297 --> 15:24.673
-[Shane] Go?
-Yeah.

15:38.562 --> 15:39.647
Wow.

15:41.565 --> 15:43.442
This is the Rice-A-Roni shot.

15:48.656 --> 15:49.907
Come on, city...

15:50.950 --> 15:52.159
I need you.

15:57.039 --> 16:00.709
What do you think... this is?

16:01.627 --> 16:02.628
Crazy.

16:03.879 --> 16:04.713
Tough.

16:05.756 --> 16:06.590
Cool.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.968
Mean.

16:10.094 --> 16:11.095
Fun.

16:11.512 --> 16:14.473
Brash, spontaneous.

16:15.849 --> 16:16.725
Beautiful.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.354
[people chattering]

16:20.980 --> 16:22.606
Oh. [groans]

16:23.023 --> 16:24.692
Man, and a huge upset.

16:24.775 --> 16:28.570
My San Francisco comes back
to defeat your San Francisco.

16:35.411 --> 16:37.705
There is one place
I've always wanted to see.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.124
Don't say the Golden Gate Bridge.

16:40.207 --> 16:41.625
The Golden Gate Bridge.

16:41.709 --> 16:45.129
-What? Too cheesy?
-No. It's just I don't do bridges.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.339
What do you mean, you don't build them?

16:47.423 --> 16:51.427
No, wiseass.
I mean, I'm deathly afraid of them.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.012
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

16:53.721 --> 16:57.099
Yeah, I mean, haven't you ever seen
footage of a bridge in an earthquake?

16:57.307 --> 17:00.978
-They're the first to go.
-Sounds like you're afraid of earthquakes.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.063
No, because you can't fall off
an earthquake

17:03.147 --> 17:05.274
and land in shark-infested waters.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.984
That's true.

17:07.776 --> 17:09.778
Yeah. Sophia is not going out like that.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.823
I decide when, where I kick the bucket.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.241
And how's that?

17:14.324 --> 17:16.368
Oh, I just live 400 more years
cryogenically

17:16.452 --> 17:19.872
and then someone accidentally unplugs
my head freezer and I thaw and die.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.331
That's how my uncle went.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.333
I miss you, Big Bill.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.919
I'll never run in the lab again.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.171
[Sophia laughs]

17:28.380 --> 17:30.716
All right, so, not the bridge,
where are we headed?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.259
Duh.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.720
Someplace magical.

17:40.893 --> 17:45.898
Behold, the secret gem stashed
in the touristy butthole

17:45.981 --> 17:48.942
of San Francisco...

17:49.151 --> 17:50.194
Jolly Jack.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.030
[chuckles] Okay.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.699
[laughing]

17:59.328 --> 18:02.247
I mean, I love this weird little fucker.

18:04.500 --> 18:08.420
You think he's done laughing
and then he just keeps laughing.

18:09.713 --> 18:11.924
[laughing continues]

18:12.883 --> 18:14.968
This is really weird.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.930
-Do it again.
-Okay, ready?

18:18.013 --> 18:21.016
Oh, I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna get you.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.976
[laughing]

18:23.769 --> 18:25.729
That is such bullshit.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.190
[Shane] Mine is not registering
any scores.

18:28.315 --> 18:30.192
You gotta hit harder!

18:30.275 --> 18:32.569
-Everyting I've played has been rigged.
-Oh!

18:32.653 --> 18:34.321
[Sophia] I don't like your style.

18:34.404 --> 18:35.906
Oh, no!

18:35.989 --> 18:37.074
No! No!

18:37.658 --> 18:40.035
[Shane] Happiness comes out. There we go.

18:40.994 --> 18:41.829
All right.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.289
I'm gonna go for the red one.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.669
-[Sophia] Okay. Come on, come on.
-[Shane] Here we go, here we go.

18:48.752 --> 18:51.588
-[grunts] Yeah. Get ready. Here we go.
-[Sophia] Yes! Make it happen.

18:51.672 --> 18:54.007
-You got it! All right, yup, yup.
-Wait for it.

18:54.091 --> 18:56.093
-Don't get too excited.
-Sometimes it falls.

18:56.176 --> 18:59.138
-Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
-Come on. Drop, baby, drop.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.641
Yeah, man, that never happens. Whoo!

19:02.724 --> 19:05.227
-I am victorious.
-Yes, you are.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.728
-Well done.
-[man] That sucks.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.189
-No. You suck, virgin.
-You--

19:09.273 --> 19:10.107
Yeah.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.235
-I...
-Wow.

19:13.485 --> 19:14.695
want you to have this.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.864
No. I couldn't. The kid's right.
It does suck.

19:16.947 --> 19:18.448
-Yeah, it's not great.
-Heh.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.993
[grunts] Come on.
Give it to me. I'll take it.

19:23.328 --> 19:24.163
A little gift.

19:25.747 --> 19:26.748
Holy shit!

19:27.249 --> 19:28.083
What?

19:30.294 --> 19:32.462
-This is it.
-This is what?

19:32.546 --> 19:34.798
-The name of my store.
-Keychain?

19:34.882 --> 19:36.466
No, no. Rubik's Vintage.

19:36.550 --> 19:39.303
Think about it.
It's colorful and complicated,

19:39.386 --> 19:41.013
a total mindfuck to figure out.

19:41.096 --> 19:42.139
It's me.

19:42.723 --> 19:47.186
-Oh, thank you, San Francisco.
-Yeah.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.146
[both cheering]

19:51.148 --> 19:52.649
[Shane] Rubik's Vintage.

19:52.983 --> 19:54.860
I'm glad that's it. You got it.

19:54.943 --> 19:56.028
[both] Yes!

19:56.111 --> 19:57.863
Now, we can go home.

19:58.113 --> 19:59.281
Okay, cool.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.867
[both] Rubik's Vintage.

20:01.950 --> 20:03.869
-[Shane] Rubik's Vintage.
-Yeah. See? You like it.

20:03.952 --> 20:06.205
-I like it already.
-It's good, right? Rubik's.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.500
[Shane] You know, I never noticed
how many murals this city has.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.295
But it is kind of nice
if you pay attention.

20:13.879 --> 20:14.838
Shit.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.174
The name is wrong.

20:17.257 --> 20:18.592
What? I like Rubik's Vintage.

20:18.675 --> 20:21.220
It's got a nice throwback feel to it,
you know? It's--

20:21.303 --> 20:22.596
It's not special enough.

20:22.679 --> 20:25.474
It has to be special. It has to be me.

20:27.768 --> 20:31.104
-Oh, God. This whole night was a waste.
-What?

20:32.064 --> 20:35.442
But we had a really fun night tonight.
Don't let this one thing ruin it.

20:35.525 --> 20:37.486
-You don't get it.
-I guess I don't.

20:37.569 --> 20:41.031
Am I crazy for not wanting our date
to end with you all pissed off?

20:41.114 --> 20:44.660
-Shane, this was never a date.
-Okay, so, drinking stolen wine,

20:44.743 --> 20:46.912
talking about our exes,
going to scenic vistas--

20:46.995 --> 20:48.664
-Yeah, not a date.
-Oh, okay.

20:53.293 --> 20:54.336
This is our stop.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.674
-Come on.
-You go.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.218
I can't move.

21:01.843 --> 21:03.220
I can't do anything.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.223
You know what? This is bullshit.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.643
You slipped me a date fajita.
Gave me all the ingredients,

21:09.726 --> 21:12.813
made me put it together
and now you're burning the shit out of me.

21:12.896 --> 21:14.773
-I know I'm not making this up.
-Dude.

21:14.856 --> 21:18.151
You were definitely feeling some Shane
in that creepy museum that you--

21:18.235 --> 21:19.069
Just come on.
