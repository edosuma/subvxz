00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:04.105 --> 00:06.105
-(heavy breathing)
-(suspenseful music playing)

00:06.107 --> 00:08.173
(snoring)

00:11.479 --> 00:14.179
No, no, no.
Please, please.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.181
No more pictures, everybody.

00:17.618 --> 00:20.352
All right. Fine, fine.
Get my good side.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.358
(music intensifies)

00:28.462 --> 00:29.628
(screams)

00:34.168 --> 00:36.435
Yes, I'll design a line
for you, Michael B. Jordan.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.404
(screaming)

00:38.406 --> 00:40.372
(stuttering):
Mom, Mom, Mom!

00:40.374 --> 00:42.541
It's a-- It's
a ch-chupacabra in there!

00:42.543 --> 00:44.510
(all screaming)

00:44.512 --> 00:46.645
Get behind me, babies!

00:46.647 --> 00:49.314
-Raven: Okay.
-(screaming)

00:49.316 --> 00:51.316
(all whimpering)

00:54.221 --> 00:56.488
Choke on some
Tropical Glaze, you creep!

01:00.494 --> 01:03.562
-(coughing)
-All: Levi?

01:03.564 --> 01:06.331
Levi, what are you wearing
and why are you interrupting

01:06.333 --> 01:08.467
my nightly date
with Michael B. Jordan?

01:08.469 --> 01:11.603
Sorry. I've been having
trouble sleeping lately.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.338
This stuff helps.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.674
That stuff makes you look
cray-cray in the day-day.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.211
Poor Levi.

01:19.213 --> 01:22.548
He's been clinging on
to things his mom sent him
from the cruise.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.650
Now he just smells
like cheap air freshener.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.419
Levi...

01:27.421 --> 01:30.456
I think I know
what's going on.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.424
You miss your mama.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.593
What? I don't miss
my mom at all.

01:38.466 --> 01:41.600
Then why do you have
a shirt with her face on it?

01:41.602 --> 01:44.269
This is a plain T-shirt.

01:45.439 --> 01:48.707
If you see my mom,
that means you miss her.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.410
Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:51.412 --> 01:54.313
I'm gonna put on
my matching pants.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.614
<i> ¶ Oh! ¶</i>

01:55.616 --> 01:57.316
<i> -¶ Hey ¶</i>
<i> -¶ Yo ¶</i>

01:57.318 --> 01:58.383
<i> ¶ Let me tell you somethin' ¶</i>

01:58.385 --> 02:00.285
<i> ¶ Had my vision</i>
<i> all worked out ¶</i>

02:00.287 --> 02:01.653
<i> ¶ But then life</i>
<i> had other plans ¶</i>

02:01.655 --> 02:03.222
<i>¶ Tell 'em, Rae ¶</i>

02:03.224 --> 02:05.290
<i> ¶ It's crazy when things</i>
<i> turn upside down ¶</i>

02:05.292 --> 02:07.593
<i> ¶ But ya gotta get up</i>
<i> and take that chance ¶</i>

02:07.595 --> 02:10.461
<i> -¶ Maybe I'm</i>
<i> just finding my way ¶</i>
<i> -¶ Learning how to fly ¶</i>

02:10.464 --> 02:12.631
<i> -¶ Yeah, we're gonna be okay ¶</i>
<i> -¶ Ya know I got you, right? ¶</i>

02:12.633 --> 02:15.234
<i> ¶ It might be wild, but ya</i>
<i> know that we make it work ¶</i>

02:15.236 --> 02:17.469
<i> ¶ We're just kids</i>
<i> caught up in a crazy world ¶</i>

02:17.471 --> 02:19.571
-¶ Come on! ¶
<i> -¶ It's</i> Raven's Home ¶

02:19.573 --> 02:21.607
<i> -¶ We get loud! ¶</i>
<i> -¶ It's</i> Raven's Home ¶

02:21.609 --> 02:23.308
<i> ¶ It's our crowd! ¶</i>

02:23.310 --> 02:25.511
<i> ¶ Might be tough, but together</i>
<i> we make it look good ¶</i>

02:25.513 --> 02:27.646
<i> ¶ Down for each other</i>
<i> like family should ¶</i>

02:27.648 --> 02:29.314
<i> ¶ It's</i> Raven's Home ¶

02:29.316 --> 02:30.482
<i> ¶ When it's tough ¶</i>

02:30.484 --> 02:31.583
<i> ¶ It's</i> Raven's Home ¶

02:31.585 --> 02:33.435
<i> ¶ We got love ¶</i>

02:33.436 --> 02:35.286
<i>¶ 'Cause no matter the weather,</i>
<i>ya know we gon' shine ¶</i>

02:35.289 --> 02:37.623
<i> ¶ There for each other,</i>
<i> ya know it's our time ¶</i>

02:37.625 --> 02:39.324
(Raven laughs)

02:39.326 --> 02:40.526
Yep! That's us.

02:48.469 --> 02:49.668
(Chelsea laughing)

02:49.670 --> 02:52.504
<i> You save me some</i>
<i> sunscreen, Nikos.</i>

02:52.506 --> 02:53.505
<i> Hey, Rae.</i>

02:53.507 --> 02:55.340
Uh-uh, girl. Don't you
"Hey, Raven" me.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.508
We need to talk
about your son.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.277
<i> Who? Levi?</i>

02:58.279 --> 02:59.344
Do you have another son

02:59.346 --> 03:01.346
that another best friend
is raising?

03:02.449 --> 03:05.651
Listen, Levi...
he's lost without you.

03:05.653 --> 03:08.687
-Chelsea: <i> What do you mean?</i>
-Here's what I mean.

03:08.689 --> 03:12.457
All right, Mom.
I need you to sign
my permission slip.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.526
Here you go.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.362
Just sign right here.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.398
Thank you.

03:20.668 --> 03:23.468
It's okay, Rae.
I've encouraged Levi
to talk to plants.

03:23.470 --> 03:24.636
It helps them grow.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.639
And besides,
he's with you.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.641
I know you wouldn't let
anything happen to my baby.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.810
Chels, you know I have
your back, but I think I've done
all I can do.

03:31.812 --> 03:35.514
I mean, I've wiped,
I've wiped noses, I've wiped...

03:35.516 --> 03:37.382
so many things.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.552
When you coming back?

03:40.554 --> 03:41.720
We need you
and we miss you.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.689
I miss you too.

03:43.691 --> 03:46.558
But, you know, these seminars,
they're a hit.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.561
It's-- It's just--
it's really hard for me
to leave right now.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.830
<i> Chels. Oh, no.</i>
<i> I see those eyes, Chels.</i>

03:51.832 --> 03:53.732
<i> I see them. They shifty.</i>
<i> What you not telling me?</i>

03:53.734 --> 03:55.667
(scoffs) Well, I--

03:55.669 --> 03:57.836
I can't disappoint
my Schmoppies.

03:57.838 --> 04:00.405
Schmoppies?
What is that, a mop cult?

04:01.408 --> 04:02.441
What about me?

04:02.443 --> 04:03.842
<i> Well, there's only one of you.</i>

04:03.844 --> 04:06.578
<i> You know?</i>
<i> There's trillions of them.</i>

04:06.580 --> 04:08.413
<i> In fact, there's a seminar</i>
<i> starting right now.</i>

04:08.415 --> 04:09.748
<i> Gotta go, love you! Bye!</i>

04:09.750 --> 04:11.416
<i> Man, that was close.</i>

04:11.418 --> 04:12.517
<i> I almost spilled the beans.</i>

04:12.519 --> 04:13.619
I knew it! I knew it!

04:13.621 --> 04:14.753
I knew the shifty eyes.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.555
What beans aren't you
telling me?

04:16.557 --> 04:17.755
Booker:
Mom, you better come here!

04:17.757 --> 04:19.591
It sounds like you have
an emergency, Rae.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.459
You better go! Love you, bye!

04:23.364 --> 04:25.597
Okay, here's the first one.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.866
This is when my mom
took me to the zoo.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.772
Levi, it's just a black screen.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.642
Yeah, she left the lens cap on.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.445
Mom.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.882
(whispering):
Just roll with it.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.451
-What's going on?
-Nia: Hey.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.719
Mom, Levi...

04:47.721 --> 04:51.556
is giving us a slide show
of family photos
with Aunt Chelsea.

04:51.558 --> 04:54.626
Oh, snap. I'm starting
to see it.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.632
Levi, admit it.
You miss your mom.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.767
Miss my mom?

05:01.769 --> 05:05.504
Don't make me laugh.
(forced laughter)

05:09.476 --> 05:11.843
Mom. Mom, I'm scared.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.812
Okay, okay.
Listen, listen.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.815
Let me just talk to Levi
really fast, okay?

05:16.817 --> 05:18.817
Um, Levi...

05:18.819 --> 05:20.519
I'm gonna go take you
to see you mom.

05:20.521 --> 05:21.820
Yes! Finally!

05:21.822 --> 05:24.489
I've been acting out
for weeks.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.491
I've already got
my suitcase packed.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.928
-I even packed for Booker.
-But what'd you pack?

05:29.930 --> 05:31.863
Whatever was clean.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.700
So I packed very light.

05:35.602 --> 05:36.835
Levi...

05:36.837 --> 05:39.604
If you wanted to see your mom,
all you had to do was ask.

05:39.606 --> 05:41.506
Auntie Rae,

05:41.508 --> 05:43.842
will you please take me
to see my mom?

05:44.945 --> 05:45.877
Yes.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.612
Yes!

05:47.614 --> 05:49.648
Okay, then I'll ask.

05:49.650 --> 05:50.816
-Can I come?
-No.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.851
But you will get
a souvenir.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.953
because you're gonna do
the most important job.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.855
You're gonna
water my plants.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.861
(grunting)

06:02.863 --> 06:05.564
-Nah! Uh!
-Booker, if your foot
touches me

06:05.566 --> 06:07.799
-one more time--
-Tess (on phone):
<i> Back off, homie!</i>

06:07.801 --> 06:09.534
<i> You're crowing us.</i>

06:09.536 --> 06:10.969
You're not even
in the car!

06:10.971 --> 06:13.572
(crunching)

06:13.574 --> 06:16.675
Gary, this is what happens
when you take a shared Scut

06:16.677 --> 06:18.543
from Chicago to Indiana.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.545
(giggles) This is what happens.

06:20.547 --> 06:23.515
Levi, why is your elbow
all the way over here?

06:23.517 --> 06:24.716
I spread when I sit.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.885
Well, spread to Nia's
side of the car.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.688
Wow, you think you're space
is more important than mine,

06:29.690 --> 06:32.724
just like you think
your New York itinerary
is more important than mine.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.560
Uh, it is.
First, we're going
to Yankee Stadium.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.562
Then we're going to get
a slice of pizza,

06:37.564 --> 06:40.532
and then we're going to wait
outside Rihanna's brownstone.

06:40.534 --> 06:41.600
Simple!

06:41.602 --> 06:43.902
No. First, we're going
to Broadway,

06:43.904 --> 06:45.937
and then we're gonna see
the Statue of Liberty,

06:45.939 --> 06:49.708
and then, we're going to go
wait outside Michael B. Jordan's
apartment.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.943
Really? (squealing)

06:52.913 --> 06:54.713
I track his location.

06:54.715 --> 06:55.947
Hey, hey, hey.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.916
First, we're going to the boat

06:57.918 --> 07:00.752
to drop me off so I can
spend the week with my mom.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.721
Well, look at that.

07:02.723 --> 07:05.924
The little one is the most
responsible in the back seat.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.626
Well, what you guys
ought to do--

07:07.628 --> 07:09.594
No, Tess. No, Tess.
What you ought to do

07:09.596 --> 07:11.897
is go water the plants
'cause we about to go
see Michael B. Jordan.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.632
-Okay?
-(Nia giggling)

07:13.634 --> 07:14.900
Bye!

07:14.902 --> 07:16.802
All right, Gary.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.937
(clears throat)
Welcome to Gary... Indiana.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.807
-Thank you riding with--
Can you take me with you?
-Gary: No.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.943
-Bye, Gary.
-Booker: Great, he's gone.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.611
Can I sit in the front seat now?

07:26.613 --> 07:29.614
Nope. If anyone gets
to sit in the front seat,
it should be me.

07:29.616 --> 07:30.949
-I'm the oldest.
-(mocking laughter)

07:30.951 --> 07:33.952
-By two minutes!
-Listen, listen, listen.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.788
-Do y'all want souvenirs?
-All: Yes.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.958
Okay, well, then leaving an open
seat for the Scut passenger

07:39.960 --> 07:42.661
is how we get
our souvenirs money, okay?

07:42.663 --> 07:45.063
Well, how about you guys
leave some room for me?

07:45.065 --> 07:47.065
Booker:
Aah! Levi, move over!

07:47.067 --> 07:49.734
Booker, I warned you.
One more time
and that foot is mine.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.570
-Oh this foot?
-Yes, this one!

07:51.572 --> 07:54.739
What Mom Commandments
are you breaking right now?

07:57.911 --> 08:01.813
Thou shalt not use
an outside voice
inside of the car.

08:01.815 --> 08:05.016
Thou shalt not kick
the back of thy mother's seat.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.685
But to be fair,

08:06.687 --> 08:08.653
I wouldn't have to kick
the back of your seat

08:08.655 --> 08:10.755
-if I could get
some room back here.
-(tires screech)

08:10.757 --> 08:13.959
-(kids arguing)
-Don't make me pull
this car over!

08:13.961 --> 08:16.862
(whimpering):
Don't make me do it.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.865
¶ ¶

08:22.836 --> 08:26.004
Welcome! Whoo! Oh!

08:26.006 --> 08:28.707
Thank you all so much
for being here.

08:28.709 --> 08:34.011
I'm Chelsea Grayson,
and I am the inventor
of the Schmop.

08:35.115 --> 08:39.017
And I'm here to help all
of you find your inspiration

08:39.019 --> 08:42.687
and become the inventor
you've always wanted to be.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.890
(giggles) Okay.

08:44.892 --> 08:47.726
Are there any questions
before we get started?

08:47.728 --> 08:49.694
First you have
to make a mess.

08:49.696 --> 08:50.795
-Okay?
-Excuse me.

08:50.797 --> 08:53.798
Oh, Miss Bertha, back again.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.901
Have you thought
of shuffleboard?

08:55.903 --> 08:59.070
Or the, um, "How To Get
Your Groove Back" seminar, huh?

08:59.072 --> 09:01.139
I think it starts
in like 10 minutes.

09:02.843 --> 09:05.877
(clears throats)
Okay. What's your question?

09:05.879 --> 09:08.847
Well, it says here
on this flyer that
I get a free Schmop.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.982
Miss Bertha, hey.
That wasn't a question.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.784
(giggling)

09:12.786 --> 09:17.889
It says here on this flyer
that I get a free Schmop,

09:17.891 --> 09:19.124
doesn't it?

09:22.996 --> 09:26.031
Okay, there we go.
All right.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.999
-(clears throat)
-Can I have hers?

09:28.001 --> 09:30.068
What? But you already
have three.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.938
Well, can I have another one?
Ain't nobody else here.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.744
Raven/Booker/Levi:
¶ We're gettin' cray-cray ¶

09:39.746 --> 09:41.780
-¶ Booker: What?
-¶ In the day-day ¶

09:41.782 --> 09:44.015
-¶ Uh ¶
-¶ And we can't stop-stop ¶

09:44.017 --> 09:45.917
-¶ So we drop-drop ¶
-¶ Woo! ¶

09:45.919 --> 09:47.886
¶ Going side by side ¶

09:47.888 --> 09:50.021
¶ Our hearts open wide-wide ¶

09:50.023 --> 09:51.890
¶ Everything's bizarre ¶

09:51.892 --> 09:53.959
¶ Watch out for
that cat, rawr-rawr! ¶

09:53.961 --> 09:55.961
¶ Ah! 'kay-'kay ¶

09:55.963 --> 09:57.862
Man, I'm having so much fun,

09:57.864 --> 10:00.098
I don't even want to know
if we're there yet!

10:00.100 --> 10:01.866
Man, are we there yet?

10:01.868 --> 10:02.901
No, sweetheart.
We're not there.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.803
-But we are in Maumee.
-Mommy?

10:04.805 --> 10:06.771
-Yeah. Maumee, Ohio.
-(tire pops)

10:06.773 --> 10:09.040
-Oh no! What's happening?
-(tire warbling)

10:09.042 --> 10:10.976
I think we have a flat.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.945
Well, there's nothing flat
about this situation!

10:13.947 --> 10:15.714
Are we there yet?

10:15.716 --> 10:16.881
Booker (sighs): No.

10:16.883 --> 10:19.884
But we got a flat,
but it's no big deal,

10:19.886 --> 10:22.120
right... Maumee?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.989
(laughing)

10:23.991 --> 10:26.925
Y'all got jokes.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.059
Let's see if y'all
still laughing

10:28.061 --> 10:29.961
when I cancel Christmas.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.931
Ha-ha!
Joke's on her.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.065
We not gon' be laughing.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.800
(guffaws)

10:35.802 --> 10:38.169
All right, y'all, listen.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.038
(grunts)

10:40.907 --> 10:43.074
Bad news is,
is that we have a flat.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.976
The good news is,
is I have a spare.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.811
So we change your tire
and get going?

10:46.813 --> 10:48.997
No, no. You didn't
let me finish.

10:48.998 --> 10:51.182
The worst news is,
I used the spare last week
so we're gonna need a tow.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.986
(whooshing)

10:54.988 --> 10:57.956
Oh, Rae! Help me!

10:57.958 --> 10:59.157
(whooshing)

11:01.128 --> 11:02.193
(gasps)

11:04.865 --> 11:07.265
I need a tow
and I need a miracle.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.837
¶ ¶

11:12.839 --> 11:14.973
Operator (over phone):
<i> Your call is very</i>
<i> important to us</i>

11:14.975 --> 11:18.109
<i> and will be answered</i>
<i> in the next 62 minutes.</i>

11:18.111 --> 11:19.210
<i> Please stay on the line.</i>

11:19.212 --> 11:21.179
Where else would I go?

11:21.181 --> 11:24.015
Auntie Rae, we've been waiting
for two hours.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.850
Are you gonna make it
to my mom in time?

11:25.852 --> 11:27.052
Calm down, sweetheart,
of course we are.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.219
We're just gonna get
the tire fixed,

11:28.221 --> 11:29.220
we're gonna get back
on the road,

11:29.222 --> 11:31.956
-we're gonna save your mom.
-Save my mom?

11:31.958 --> 11:33.958
Did I say save?

11:33.960 --> 11:37.128
I didn't mean-- I meant to say
we're gonna see your mom.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.030
I switched up words
for a reason.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.866
Did I say
"for a reason"?

11:41.868 --> 11:45.103
I meant for no rea--
(laughs nervously)

11:46.073 --> 11:47.238
We're not gonna make it.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.207
(panting):
Is it just me

11:49.209 --> 11:51.142
or is this car
getting smaller

11:51.144 --> 11:53.144
-and smaller?
-Hold up, hold up, now, Levi.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.979
Levi, stay with me, okay?

11:54.981 --> 11:56.531
Look at all the extra
room you have.

11:56.532 --> 11:58.082
-Look at all that.
-Yeah, with all
that breathing room,

11:58.085 --> 12:00.852
you should relax
and take your mind
off of it.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.254
Fine. I'll just look out
the window.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.223
It will soothe me.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.861
Uh, I can't see.
I need a window seat.

12:09.863 --> 12:10.995
Booker,
switch seats with him.

12:10.997 --> 12:12.297
-Mom--
-Now, boy!

12:14.835 --> 12:16.901
(grunts)

12:18.271 --> 12:20.905
Okay.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.173
Corn.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.109
-Cow.
-(cow mooing)

12:24.111 --> 12:26.244
Tess. Tow truck.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.947
Hold up. Wait, wait, wait.
Hold up. Did you say Tess?

12:28.949 --> 12:31.116
-Yeah, hold up.
Did you say tow truck?
-(honking)

12:31.118 --> 12:33.218
How's it going family?

12:33.220 --> 12:36.020
Who wants a tuna sandwich?

12:36.022 --> 12:37.155
-Oh!
-Oh!

12:42.195 --> 12:45.230
Hey, Chelsea!
What's Schmopping?

12:45.232 --> 12:47.298
(both laughing)

12:47.300 --> 12:50.068
Thanks for clearing out
so I can do my Lip Kitty
presentation.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.937
Lip Kitties!
(kisses) Meow, meow!

12:54.274 --> 12:56.975
Okay, Tabby, Calico,
lip gloss over here.

12:56.977 --> 12:59.210
Whiskers, Socks,
swag bags over there.

13:01.081 --> 13:04.048
You know, considering
cats don't have lips,

13:04.050 --> 13:07.952
the concept of Lip Kitties
is so inspired.

13:07.954 --> 13:11.289
Can you believe my dad
didn't want to hire them?

13:11.291 --> 13:15.126
It's like, you only lent me
a measly one million dollars

13:15.128 --> 13:16.895
to start this company.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.396
(scoffs)
A little help here, Dad!

13:19.332 --> 13:22.967
Wow. I started the Schmop
with 5.99

13:22.969 --> 13:24.969
and a magic eight ball.
You know, like,

13:24.971 --> 13:27.305
"Will the Schmop work?"
Whaaa!

13:27.307 --> 13:29.340
Ah! "Odds are in your favor!"

13:30.944 --> 13:33.378
It's just so hard running
your own company.

13:33.380 --> 13:38.049
Hey, catnip eyeliner
next to the kitty glitter.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.053
I have to do everything.
Rawr!

13:42.055 --> 13:47.025
Yeah, I mean,
run your own business
and this Inventors' Cruise.

13:47.027 --> 13:50.295
I mean, it's...
it's almost like
you have nine lives.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.030
(both laughing)

13:52.032 --> 13:53.932
You know what else
is like, so weird?

13:53.934 --> 13:55.166
-What?
-Like how you were
my idol,

13:55.168 --> 13:56.301
and now I'm your boss.

13:56.303 --> 13:59.037
And I'm like, way younger
than you are.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.173
So, Chelsea, how many
Schmops have you sold?

14:02.175 --> 14:05.343
Oh, I'm not doing too
great today, actually.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.346
You've been here
six months.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.982
You need to pick it up
with her seminar
and your sales.

14:10.984 --> 14:14.052
Yeah. Actually, um,
you know one customer
couldn't get enough.

14:14.054 --> 14:17.121
She was, you know,
picking them up faster
than I could put them down.

14:17.123 --> 14:19.023
Miss Bertha does not count.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.360
Chelsea Grayson,
you have done this before.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.362
You need to figure out
what success means
to you now,

14:24.364 --> 14:26.297
and then don't let anything
get in your way.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.465
Yeah.

14:27.467 --> 14:30.969
Actually, my... my son Levi
getting in the way

14:30.971 --> 14:32.403
was my inspiration
for the Schmop.

14:32.405 --> 14:35.073
(chuckles)
Gosh, he was
such a messy kid.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.308
Actually, this one time
he spilled apple sauce
all over the floor--

14:37.310 --> 14:40.211
Aw. I don't relate to that.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.314
Chelsea, listen to me.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.250
In order to sell the Schmop,

14:45.252 --> 14:47.051
you need to love the Schmop.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.087
-Yeah.
-Do you love the Schmop?

14:49.089 --> 14:51.155
Yes! Of course I do.

14:51.157 --> 14:55.326
Great. Then don't let anything
get in between you
and what you love.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.228
(kisses)
Ciao meow.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.297
(kisses)
Mow-chow.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.238
-Thanks, Uncle Jimmy!
-(honking)

15:07.240 --> 15:08.439
Okay, let's go.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.375
Hey, wait, I thought
your dad's name was Jimmy.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.076
Yeah, Chicago Jimmy.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.044
That was Ohio Jimmy.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.063
And he didn't mind
helping out

15:15.064 --> 15:17.081
since he's on his way
to visit Staten Island Jimmy.

15:17.083 --> 15:21.019
Well, it was nice of
your uncle to help out.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.453
But I don't think
we're gonna make it in time.

15:23.290 --> 15:26.190
Oh, Levi, stop worrying.

15:26.192 --> 15:27.392
Tess, thanks for coming.

15:27.394 --> 15:30.061
Nia, thanks for
texting Tess to come.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.130
And, Booker, stop hoarding
the tuna sandwiches.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.365
Oh no, I, uh,
I already ate all them.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.100
Oh, then you're
sweating it out, boo.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.368
-Put your shoes back on.
-Nia: Ew!

15:37.370 --> 15:38.369
It's so gross.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.104
All right, everybody,
buckle up!

15:40.106 --> 15:41.439
Seat belts.

15:41.441 --> 15:44.375
All righty, let's get going.

15:44.377 --> 15:47.111
-Great.
-(giggles)

15:47.113 --> 15:49.080
Wait, how come Tess
gets to sit in the front?

15:49.082 --> 15:51.449
(sighs)
Thou shalt not ask Mama
no more questions

15:51.451 --> 15:53.051
-this trip.
-That's not fair!

15:53.053 --> 15:55.520
(kids arguing)

16:00.293 --> 16:04.028
-<i> ¶ So quiet and I wanna know ¶</i>
-¶ Why, ooh ¶

16:04.030 --> 16:06.397
-¶ Ooh! Yeah! ¶
<i> -¶ Love is like a jumbo jet ¶</i>

16:06.399 --> 16:09.300
-<i> ¶ Why don't we just fly it? ¶</i>
-¶ Fly, fly, fly, fly ¶

16:09.302 --> 16:11.336
<i> -¶ Don't want to see you fret ¶</i>
-¶ Yeah ¶

16:11.338 --> 16:15.139
-<i> ¶ So shy, shy, shy ¶</i>
-¶ So shy, shy, shy ¶

16:16.509 --> 16:18.276
(phone ringing)

16:18.278 --> 16:20.278
(vocalizing)

16:20.280 --> 16:22.113
-Hey, Chels. What's up?
-Hey!

16:22.115 --> 16:23.181
Hey, where's Levi?

16:23.183 --> 16:25.516
He is strapped
to the roof of the car.

16:25.518 --> 16:29.253
(laughs) That was
only funny once, Rae.

16:29.255 --> 16:32.156
(laughing)
I'm still laughing, Chels.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.758
Still laughing.

16:33.759 --> 16:35.359
Uh, no. They're asleep.
Everybody's asleep.
What's going on?

16:35.362 --> 16:37.328
I...

16:37.330 --> 16:39.330
I want to come home.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.165
But we're bring Levi to you.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.134
No. No, Rae.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.303
This is over.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.604
It's time for me
to come home.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.506
Oh, okay. Well...

16:50.310 --> 16:52.310
You know what that means.

16:52.312 --> 16:55.546
We're really gonna
have to strap Levi
to the top of the car.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.216
Come on, Rae!
I'm serious.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.183
Is that you mom?

16:59.185 --> 17:01.285
(gasps) Hi! Levi!
Is that my baby boy?

17:01.287 --> 17:03.321
I can't wait to see you!

17:03.323 --> 17:05.289
Chelsea: <i> Oh, honey.</i>
<i> Oh, I can't wait to...</i>

17:05.290 --> 17:07.392
(static crackles):
e <i> e-aah-oh-aah</i>
<i> ...you either.</i>

17:07.394 --> 17:09.160
Pedal to the metal,
Auntie Rae!

17:09.162 --> 17:11.162
I need to "ee-aah-oh-aah"
my mom!

17:11.164 --> 17:12.530
Oh, okay. All right.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.301
¶ ¶

17:18.304 --> 17:20.371
Guys, this is it!

17:20.373 --> 17:22.205
The Inspired Inventors'
Cruise!

17:22.208 --> 17:24.242
We made it just in time.

17:24.243 --> 17:25.476
Whoa!

17:25.478 --> 17:27.244
Look at how big
that boat is.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.313
Chill, Booker,
you acting brand-new.

17:29.315 --> 17:31.315
Oh, so. You've been
on a cruise before?

17:31.317 --> 17:32.550
We're talking about you.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.219
Guys, where's my mom?

17:35.221 --> 17:37.321
I wanna be the first one
to see her. Where is she?

17:39.592 --> 17:41.225
Oh! There she is.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.394
Mom! Mom! Here I am!

17:43.396 --> 17:45.396
Levi! Levi!

17:46.666 --> 17:49.600
Kids, go get him.
Those chicken legs run fast.
Go ahead.

17:53.506 --> 17:56.240
Excuse me, um, have
you seen my best friend?

17:56.242 --> 17:58.576
She's about yea tall,
super bossy--

17:58.578 --> 18:00.244
Lady, I don't know where--

18:00.246 --> 18:03.247
(both screaming)

18:03.249 --> 18:05.249
-Oh, I missed you so much.
-I know!

18:05.251 --> 18:07.585
Chels, listen. I think
I had a vision of you
falling off the boat.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.420
(gasps) You know what?

18:09.422 --> 18:13.224
I did trip on the way over here
to meet you, but I'm fine.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.243
-Okay.
-(giggling)

18:15.244 --> 18:17.261
-Where's Levi?
-Oh, he got so excited,
he ran up the ramp.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.564
The kids are getting him.
Then, before we head home,
we're gonna see the sights.

18:19.566 --> 18:22.300
We're gonna see
the Statue of Liberty,
we're gonna see Times Square,

18:22.302 --> 18:25.369
and try some of that so-called
"pizza" they got here.

18:25.371 --> 18:27.705
Oh, it's been so long
since I've seen Levi.

18:27.707 --> 18:30.441
I can't wait to hug him
and kiss him and squeeze him.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.444
I missed him so much.
(giggles)

18:33.446 --> 18:36.614
-I... I missed
the twins too.
-Oh, yeah.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.283
And that girl
across the hall.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.652
-You know what else
you missed?
-What?

18:41.654 --> 18:44.388
Mr. Protein Shake
across the street
just bought a brand--

18:44.390 --> 18:46.324
(horn blaring)

18:46.326 --> 18:49.660
-What about the--
-(horn blaring)

18:49.662 --> 18:53.664
-And when he made--
-(horn blaring)

18:53.666 --> 18:56.234
Chelsea, watch your mouth!

18:56.236 --> 18:58.569
-No! That's
three horns, Rae.
-Huh?

18:58.571 --> 19:00.671
Which means
the ship's leaving.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.674
Both:
Oh! What are we gonna do?

19:03.676 --> 19:05.676
-(ships horn blares)
-Mom! Mom!

19:06.579 --> 19:08.546
Whoa. Not Mom. Not Mom.

19:09.749 --> 19:12.483
Guys, where's my mom?
I don't see her.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.352
There she is! Mom!

19:14.354 --> 19:15.653
Aunt Chelsea! Hi!

19:17.690 --> 19:21.425
Hey, why is the dock
moving away from the ship?

19:21.427 --> 19:23.394
It's not the dock
that's moving,
it's us!

19:23.396 --> 19:27.265
Somebody stop that boat!
Somebody stop that boat!

19:27.267 --> 19:29.367
I need to see my baby!

19:29.369 --> 19:30.768
Calm down Chels.
Calm down. It'll be okay.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.271
-No!
-Okay, wait.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.705
(phone rings)

19:34.707 --> 19:36.340
-Mom?
-Raven (over phone): <i> Kids!</i>

19:36.342 --> 19:37.608
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be okay.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.377
-We'll find a way
to get to you somehow.
-Yeah.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.444
Okay, Mom.

19:40.446 --> 19:41.779
Hey, Levi.
Are you okay?

19:41.781 --> 19:45.316
I-I can't see her.
I can't see her!

19:45.318 --> 19:47.485
Chelsea (over phone):
<i> It's okay, honey.</i>
<i> Mommy's right here!</i>

19:47.487 --> 19:49.353
I can hear her.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.588
(gasps) I can hear her!

19:51.691 --> 19:53.524
But I need to see her!

19:53.526 --> 19:55.493
Mom! Can you see me?

19:55.495 --> 19:58.296
I'm gonna be honest,
Levi, honey!

19:58.298 --> 20:00.631
No, not really!

20:00.633 --> 20:02.533
Chels, what are
we gonna do?

20:02.535 --> 20:04.502
Can't they stop the boat?
Our kids are on that boat.

20:04.504 --> 20:07.538
No. Once the boat leaves port,
it never backs up.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.507
They tried it once
with the <i> Titanic,</i>

20:09.509 --> 20:11.542
you know, and we all know
how that turned out.

20:11.544 --> 20:15.713
Okay, Mom. We will just
go to Aunt Chelsea's cabin

20:15.715 --> 20:17.715
and wait for you to tell us
what to do next.

20:17.717 --> 20:18.816
Okay, Chels.
What do they do next?

20:18.818 --> 20:22.353
Listen, kids.
I'm in cabin 4002.

20:22.355 --> 20:23.821
Just stay there
and wait for Raven and I

20:23.823 --> 20:25.556
to drive up and meet you
at the next port.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.824
Oh, what's that?
Like Staten Island?

20:26.826 --> 20:30.761
It's not a ferry, Raven.
It's a cruise ship.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.663
The next stop is Miami.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.332
All:
Miami?

20:34.334 --> 20:36.534
Chels, how long is it
gonna take us to get to Miami?

20:36.536 --> 20:38.669
Uh, by car about 20 hours.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.538
By cruise ship?

20:40.540 --> 20:42.673
-Five days.
-Kids and Raven: Five days!

20:42.675 --> 20:44.508
-Oh, no.
-Jeez!

20:45.545 --> 20:47.578
What are we gonna do?
We don't have any money.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.580
And any deodorant.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.615
No underwear.

20:50.617 --> 20:51.849
-Oh.
-I know.

20:51.851 --> 20:52.850
Chelsea:
<i> Listen, kids.</i>
<i> You'll be fine.</i>

20:52.852 --> 20:54.685
There's 24-hour buffets.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.354
There's a tween disco,
you know?

20:56.356 --> 20:58.522
There's games, prizes,

20:58.524 --> 21:00.791
contests, you know.
It's-- it's...

21:00.793 --> 21:02.760
Well, it's a paradise.

21:02.762 --> 21:06.764
Chels, it's a paradise
for paying customers.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.567
-That's right.
-We brought Levi to see you.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.702
He's the only one
with a ticket.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.538
-I know.
-My babies are stowaways.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.610
Listen, kids,
just stick with Levi.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.446
His wristband will help you
get anything you need, okay?

21:22.448 --> 21:24.615
Mom, I miss you.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.550
Oh, Levi.

21:26.552 --> 21:27.818
Levi, I--

21:34.394 --> 21:36.661
Well, I guess we're just gonna
have to be by ourselves

21:36.663 --> 21:37.828
for the next five days.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.731
I am so freaking out
right now.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.733
I know, Booker.
Look, we're gonna be okay.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.802
I just-- I just don't know
what to do.

21:44.804 --> 21:48.673
I mean, dance, eat,
swim, win a prize.

21:48.675 --> 21:52.610
I mean, there are just
so many choice in paradise.

21:52.612 --> 21:54.412
(giggling) Hey!

21:54.414 --> 21:56.914
-Maybe I should get
a pair of maracas.
-Yeah!

21:57.684 --> 21:59.583
Five days?

21:59.585 --> 22:02.820
Our kids can't be alone
on a boat for five days.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.855
-I know.
-I barely trust them
to be alone

22:04.857 --> 22:06.857
for five minutes.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.659
What are we gonna do, Rae?
I mean,

22:08.661 --> 22:10.528
how are we even gonna
catch up to them?

22:10.530 --> 22:11.662
I don't know.
I don't know.

22:14.701 --> 22:15.900
(mouths)

22:17.704 --> 22:19.503
Hold on tight, Chels!

22:19.505 --> 22:21.472
Can you do this, Raven?

22:21.474 --> 22:23.507
Of course I can!
It's for the kids.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.843
Now stop talking
and hold down my wig!

22:25.845 --> 22:27.845
(both screaming)

22:27.847 --> 22:31.515

22:31.517 --> 22:33.517
