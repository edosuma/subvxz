WEBVTT

00:01.131 --> 00:04.526
It is time
for the Eighth Annual

00:04.569 --> 00:07.398
Sophie Nairobi Cooper
Explosion of Riddles

00:07.442 --> 00:09.487
Birthday Scavenger Hunt!

00:09.531 --> 00:13.535
♪ Da, da, da, da,
da, da, da ♪

00:14.449 --> 00:16.842
Did you just
double-blindfold me

00:16.886 --> 00:18.409
to walk me
from my room to here?

00:18.453 --> 00:19.932
Correct.

00:19.976 --> 00:21.717
I already told you what I wanted
for my birthday this year.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.458
Wrong. You're not getting
your ears pierced

00:23.501 --> 00:24.633
until you're 11.

00:24.676 --> 00:25.895
If I can't get
my ears pierced,

00:25.938 --> 00:27.331
I'd love a non-babyish
birthday...

00:27.375 --> 00:28.724
Mm-hmm.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.943
...like maybe an intimate
luncheon with friends,

00:30.987 --> 00:34.077
like Sir Bridger and Lady Agnes'
Boxing Day party.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.079
I've been trying to get through
this Sir Bridgerseries

00:36.123 --> 00:38.473
for, like, months now,
'cause there's 40 seasons,

00:38.516 --> 00:40.214
and every season
is three episodes,

00:40.257 --> 00:41.563
and every episode's
four hours long.

00:41.606 --> 00:44.566
And the only way to see it
is to donate $300 to PBS.

00:44.609 --> 00:45.958
Well, I promise you will get

00:46.002 --> 00:48.091
the old British lady
birthday party of your dreams

00:48.135 --> 00:50.572
after you solve...this clue.

00:51.790 --> 00:54.315
"It's your birthday
and the fun won't stop.

00:54.358 --> 00:57.274
To get the next clue,
you must...pop!"

01:02.192 --> 01:03.324
Oooh!

01:03.367 --> 01:05.239
Diversion, or a clue?

01:05.282 --> 01:07.241
Uh, not part of the hunt.

01:08.807 --> 01:12.246
-Mom?!
-Happy birthday, baby!

01:12.289 --> 01:16.337
Best scavenger hunt ever!

01:16.380 --> 01:18.165
Not part of the hunt.

01:25.302 --> 01:26.347
She's here.

01:26.390 --> 01:28.523
She's here! She's here!
She's here!

01:28.566 --> 01:31.352
Is that -- Oh, my God.
It's happening.

01:31.395 --> 01:32.570
We're meeting
Will's ex-wife.

01:32.614 --> 01:33.702
-Oh, my God.
-Impressive.

01:33.745 --> 01:35.182
POPPY:
It's Big Ol' Sophie!

01:35.225 --> 01:36.748
Do I call her
"Mrs. Cooper" or "Mom"?

01:36.792 --> 01:40.361
Hey, guys, this is my --
this -- Sophie'smom, Mia.

01:40.404 --> 01:43.146
Hello. It's so wonderful
to meet all of you.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.714
I've heard so much about you
from Sophie.

01:45.757 --> 01:49.370
You must be Douglas.
What a wonderful face.

01:49.413 --> 01:52.155
And Miggy --
so wise beneath that hat.

01:52.199 --> 01:54.766
Poppy, I feel
very close to you.

01:54.810 --> 01:57.204
-Oh.
-And, Angie, wow,

01:57.247 --> 01:58.422
I pictured you taller,

01:58.466 --> 02:01.033
but, you know, I feel
so connected to all of you,

02:01.077 --> 02:03.384
and I hope that you'll feel
connected to me, too.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.821
This world can be
such a hard place,

02:05.864 --> 02:07.823
which is why it's so important

02:07.866 --> 02:11.827
that we seek out love and hold
onto it when we find it.

02:11.870 --> 02:14.221
Don't you think?

02:14.264 --> 02:16.223
Oh. Wow.

02:16.266 --> 02:17.398
Never leave us.

02:19.008 --> 02:20.401
WILL: You know, this has been
fun, but you should probably

02:20.444 --> 02:22.185
get into Sophie's classroom
before she -- Okay.

02:22.229 --> 02:23.578
Oh, you know what?
I have gifts for all of you.

02:23.621 --> 02:27.408
After I won a case restricting
slash-and-burn agriculture

02:27.451 --> 02:30.672
in Ghana, I was thanked
with these sculptures.

02:30.715 --> 02:32.369
I started thinking
of these little guys

02:32.413 --> 02:33.588
-as my companions.
-Aww.

02:33.631 --> 02:38.245
I now give my old friends
to my new friends.

02:38.288 --> 02:40.203
-I feel like I'm crying.
-Get a hold of yourself.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.205
You know, I should go check out
Sophie's classroom.

02:42.249 --> 02:43.467
I just said that.

02:43.511 --> 02:45.339
It'll be so nice to see one

02:45.382 --> 02:46.688
that I didn't have to build
by hand.

02:46.731 --> 02:48.907
-It's a good classroom.

02:48.951 --> 02:51.388
You'll enjoy it. Sophie will
love having you in there.

02:51.432 --> 02:53.608
Okay, so your ex-wife is,
like, a really good person.

02:53.651 --> 02:56.306
-Yeah, she's incredible.
-She's better than
Ariana Grande.

02:56.350 --> 02:58.787
-Solid seven.
-I know. She's unbelievable.

02:58.830 --> 03:00.267
-And she's driving me crazy.
-POPPY: Oof.

03:00.310 --> 03:01.572
Co-parenting.

03:01.616 --> 03:04.009
Two people trying to walk
the same dog with one leash.

03:04.053 --> 03:06.273
And I'm sorry for calling your
daughter a dog in that metaphor,

03:06.316 --> 03:08.057
-but you get it.
-I forgive you.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.580
You know what you need?
Girls' night at Angie's.
Right, Poppy?

03:09.624 --> 03:10.581
-Oh, yeah.

03:10.625 --> 03:11.930
When I was
in the thick of it with Ron,

03:11.974 --> 03:13.280
Angie threw a girls' night
that saved my life.

03:13.323 --> 03:14.716
-WILL: Aww.
-You know, I'm always
curious to know

03:14.759 --> 03:16.718
what goes on during
these "girls' nights."

03:16.761 --> 03:18.937
What do you do, like, eat yogurt
and tickle each other?

03:18.981 --> 03:21.070
-Mm-hmm, yeah,
that's exactlywhat we do.
-ANGIE: Yeah. That's right.

03:21.113 --> 03:22.376
MIGGY: Come on, man.

03:22.419 --> 03:23.464
So, your mom's in town?

03:23.507 --> 03:25.379
-How are you holding up?
-Great.

03:25.422 --> 03:27.119
-I love when she's here.
-Okay.

03:27.163 --> 03:29.078
Well, if you need any advice
about how to handle

03:29.121 --> 03:31.254
the two-parent struggle,
let me know.

03:31.298 --> 03:33.125
I get so full from
back-to-back Thanksgivings

03:33.169 --> 03:34.953
that I've been driven
to drawstring pants.

03:34.997 --> 03:37.391
It's not like I want
my parents to get back
together or anything.

03:37.434 --> 03:40.524
I don't even have any memories
of them being together.

03:40.568 --> 03:42.700
For real?
Not even one?

03:42.744 --> 03:46.269
Actually, I remember once
when we went to a pizza place

03:46.313 --> 03:49.968
and we some took photos in one
of those old-timey photo booths.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.318
It was so fun.

03:51.361 --> 03:54.712
Did you know that photos
could be on paper?

03:54.756 --> 03:56.975
-What?
-It's insane.

03:58.107 --> 03:59.064
Dropping off.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.414
Emma and Amy
are in your front yard

04:00.457 --> 04:01.980
throwing rocks
at each other.

04:02.024 --> 04:03.330
Have a nice time.

04:03.373 --> 04:04.418
Wait a second.

04:04.461 --> 04:05.897
Is this what I think it is?

04:05.941 --> 04:07.899
Yep,
I'm giving away my stuff.

04:07.943 --> 04:11.076
Yeah. Sophie's mom
did a real number on him.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.382
MIGGY: She's doing so much
for the world.

04:12.426 --> 04:13.949
And what am I doing?

04:13.992 --> 04:15.951
Actually, I did make a sequel
to my music video

04:15.994 --> 04:17.300
and it came out pretty dope.

04:17.344 --> 04:21.173
Mystery Señorita:
Sexy Christmas.

04:21.217 --> 04:22.697
I held a boom
for nine hours.

04:22.740 --> 04:25.352
Listen. I have a policy
that's served me well --

04:25.395 --> 04:28.529
never give away anything unless
you're getting something back.

04:28.572 --> 04:31.314
The only reason I clothe
and feed Emma and Amy

04:31.358 --> 04:34.317
is so they'll put me in a home
with a decent pool.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.319
The man didn't get where he is
by giving bad advice.

04:36.363 --> 04:37.320
Word.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.191
Nobody likes
a kiss ass.

04:39.235 --> 04:40.541
Not in the head, Amy!

04:40.584 --> 04:42.543
-I still can't shake
this feeling, G.

04:42.586 --> 04:46.329
-I have more stuff than I need.
-Yeah. You're just one guy.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.679
And that's a buttload
of orange soda.

04:48.723 --> 04:51.378
You're right.
The soda goes in the box!

04:56.165 --> 04:58.341
Dude, that felt good.
Try it.

04:58.385 --> 04:59.690
Okay, pencil case.

04:59.734 --> 05:02.127
Our time together
has come to an end.

05:02.171 --> 05:03.346
Mm.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.264
-Giving feels good!
-Yeah.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.614
It's like putting on socks
that just came out of the dryer.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.486
Hella toasty.
Let's go even harder.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.531
Let's give away stuff
we really care about.

05:14.575 --> 05:16.968
I'm gonna give Mr. Roar
to Sophie for her birthday.

05:17.012 --> 05:20.842
Whoa. Okay.
I see your Mr. Roar,

05:20.885 --> 05:23.497
and I raise you
my most prized possession.

05:23.540 --> 05:25.716
-My Nike Air Max 90 Corks.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.152
-Oh!
-I love these so much,

05:27.196 --> 05:28.415
I got adult baptized in them.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.373
But they're going in!

05:30.417 --> 05:32.288
-We're really good people!
-We really are!

05:32.332 --> 05:34.508
Let's go donate them now before
we change our minds.

05:34.551 --> 05:36.858
-I'm gonna go put on
some less dope shoes.
-GRAHAM: Excellent idea.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.381
Charity.

05:39.904 --> 05:42.385
-Well, that's done.
-Yep.

05:44.126 --> 05:47.085
The joy of giving
lasted five seconds!

05:47.129 --> 05:49.566
What have we done?!

05:49.610 --> 05:53.091
Hey, Mom said I could open
a present a day early.

05:53.135 --> 05:54.441
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:54.484 --> 05:55.616
-No way.
-What's wrong?

05:55.659 --> 05:57.487
-Is the knife too big?

05:57.531 --> 05:58.923
I'm sorry, it's just,

05:58.967 --> 06:01.056
I've seen a 2-year-old
use a bigger one than that.

06:01.099 --> 06:02.623
Oh, uh, Sophie,
I just remembered.

06:02.666 --> 06:05.277
I think there's a bonus
birthday clue in the kitchen.

06:05.321 --> 06:06.757
Why don't you go
try to find it, okay?

06:06.801 --> 06:12.546
I'll fall for that,
but only because I love you.

06:12.589 --> 06:14.461
Hey, look, I'm glad

06:14.504 --> 06:16.811
that you and Sophie are getting
all this time together,

06:16.854 --> 06:18.769
but I have rules
for a reason.

06:18.813 --> 06:20.554
What is the reason?

06:20.597 --> 06:22.643
Without rules,
social order falls into chaos.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.993
You used to be, like,
a lot more fun.

06:25.036 --> 06:26.647
I mean,
what happened to the guy

06:26.690 --> 06:29.519
who took me on a road trip
to Oklahoma

06:29.563 --> 06:32.000
so that I could
"taste tornado rain"?

06:32.043 --> 06:34.785
Not many people
can say they've had...

06:34.829 --> 06:36.396
danger on their tongue.

06:37.832 --> 06:40.312
What is that?

06:40.356 --> 06:41.792
You know you're having
birthday cake tomorrow.

06:41.836 --> 06:42.793
Mom said I could.

06:42.837 --> 06:44.534
WILL: Okay. Well. FYI --

06:44.578 --> 06:47.494
Sophie has crazy reactions
when she has too much sugar.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.887
I won't even tell you what
happened at Halloween 2015,

06:49.931 --> 06:52.586
but let's just say we are not
invited back to that corn maze.

06:52.629 --> 06:54.936
There's a shortcut if you just
run straight through the corn.

06:54.979 --> 06:56.720
MIA: I think we should
let her have it.

06:56.764 --> 06:59.593
If a child in one of the most
developed nations in the world

06:59.636 --> 07:02.073
has a little extra ice cream,
it's probably okay.

07:02.117 --> 07:05.337
-Right, Sophie-Bear?
-SOPHIE: Right. Mmmm.

07:05.381 --> 07:06.469
Good call on putting
an extra layer

07:06.513 --> 07:07.601
of gummy worms
on the bottom.

07:07.644 --> 07:11.039
So sour! So wormy!

07:14.303 --> 07:15.870
I need a girls' night.

07:15.913 --> 07:17.437
Get in here, bitch.

07:19.743 --> 07:21.832
Welcome to girls' night!

07:21.876 --> 07:23.747
-Thisis girls' night?
-It is now.

07:23.791 --> 07:25.749
You can take
the tape off when --

07:25.793 --> 07:27.534
WILL: Angie,
you don't have to explain

07:27.577 --> 07:28.622
-Edward 40-Hands to me.

07:28.665 --> 07:30.101
I went to college
in South Florida.

07:30.145 --> 07:32.060
Poppy, I'm a little shocked
that this is yourscene.

07:32.103 --> 07:34.062
Hey, this is how
D'Amato likes it.

07:34.105 --> 07:36.151
-So, Mia's driving
you crazy, huh?
-WILL: Oof.

07:36.194 --> 07:38.675
ANGIE: Oh, yeah, why did you two
split up, anyway?

07:38.719 --> 07:40.416
-Was it your affinity
for Dave Matthews?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.766
Ooh, I bet you're really
annoying on vacation, huh?

07:42.810 --> 07:46.204
No. No, it's just,
we've changed, you know?

07:46.248 --> 07:47.989
When Mia and I
first got together,

07:48.032 --> 07:49.077
we were always on the go,

07:49.120 --> 07:50.557
and then when we had Sophie,

07:50.600 --> 07:52.950
I wanted to put down roots
and Mia did not.

07:52.994 --> 07:54.604
She hung around
for a couple years,

07:54.648 --> 07:57.955
but I-I could see
the life-force in her draining.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.653
Like a fly
on the second day.

07:59.696 --> 08:02.090
Okay, is that true?
I guess I don't know
that much about flies.

08:02.133 --> 08:04.309
-Girls' night.
-Mia was miserable.

08:04.353 --> 08:07.312
We would fight nonstop,
and then we split.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.750
And now every time I see her
face, all I want to do is yell,

08:09.793 --> 08:10.620
"Give me back my 20s!"

08:11.621 --> 08:13.144
ANGIE:
Okay, here's the deal.

08:13.188 --> 08:15.103
You have to take
all the emotion

08:15.146 --> 08:16.539
out of your interactions
with Mia.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.976
The two of you
are now running a business --

08:19.020 --> 08:20.717
Sophie, Incorporated.

08:20.761 --> 08:23.111
But how am I supposed to take
emotion out of a relationship

08:23.154 --> 08:24.199
where I have
so much history?

08:24.242 --> 08:26.680
I mean, I saw Sophie
come out of her body.

08:26.723 --> 08:27.768
And we're gonna
circle back to that.

08:27.811 --> 08:29.726
-ANGIE: Look, from now on,

08:29.770 --> 08:31.554
you are going to
only deal with Mia

08:31.598 --> 08:33.425
on Sophie-related
business.

08:33.469 --> 08:36.341
And when you do, you are
going to be cool, professional.

08:36.385 --> 08:37.908
Like Customer Service.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.910
"Yes, ma'am.
Just a moment.

08:39.954 --> 08:41.695
Please hold while I dial
that extension.

08:41.738 --> 08:43.827
Para español,
número dos."

08:43.871 --> 08:46.569
And then all that crazy stuff
that you want to say to Mia,

08:46.613 --> 08:47.744
say to meinstead.

08:47.788 --> 08:49.833
C'mon, let's try it.

08:49.877 --> 08:51.226
You want me to yell at you
like you'reMia.

08:51.269 --> 08:52.270
Yes!

08:52.314 --> 08:53.837
It worked wonders for Poppy

08:53.881 --> 08:55.622
when she was going through
ex hell with Ron. Right, Pops?

08:55.665 --> 08:57.711
She does a shockingly good
Ron impression.

08:57.754 --> 08:59.582
Sometimes I call her
just to hear him apologize.

08:59.626 --> 09:02.716
Okay, um, sure.
Lead me in.

09:02.759 --> 09:06.241
I'm Mia.
I'm a really good person!

09:06.284 --> 09:09.592
I'm like if Gwyneth Paltrow
had a baby with Gwyneth Paltrow!

09:09.636 --> 09:11.376
-Hummus!

09:11.420 --> 09:14.205
Um, you need to respect
my parenting choices.

09:14.249 --> 09:16.077
I lead a tight ship
for a reason.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.818
More. More.

09:17.861 --> 09:19.036
I love-hate you so hard.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.516
And I have a fantasy

09:20.560 --> 09:22.039
of you tripping in front of
a large group of people

09:22.083 --> 09:24.085
and all of them pointing
and laughing at you.

09:24.128 --> 09:26.435
Oh, you go deep fast.

09:35.749 --> 09:38.752
-CHILD: Oh, my gosh!
-I know that look.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.841
You two dummies did
something good, didn't you?

09:40.884 --> 09:42.756
You gotta help us
get our stuff back, man.

09:42.799 --> 09:45.280
You're, like, the closest thing
we have to Liam Neeson.

09:45.323 --> 09:46.629
Okay, I'm not gonna
come to your rescue,

09:46.673 --> 09:49.501
but what I am gonna do
is teach you a life lesson here,

09:49.545 --> 09:52.853
since, emotionally,
you're both 7 years old.

09:52.896 --> 09:54.768
-Great burn.
-Bro!

09:54.811 --> 09:56.770
Ask for your things back.

09:56.813 --> 09:57.771
Don't take no for an answer.

09:57.814 --> 09:59.294
Remember --

09:59.337 --> 10:02.210
you did something nice,
but it was a stupid accident.

10:02.253 --> 10:05.779
Isn't asking for something back
against the rules?

10:05.822 --> 10:08.651
Youmake the rules,
you understand?

10:10.348 --> 10:13.743
Oh, so you'reSophie's friend
that's not us.

10:14.918 --> 10:15.832
You look like
a book person.

10:15.876 --> 10:17.791
Here you go,
Sophie-Bear.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.880
Ooooh, Clotted Creamos!
My fave!

10:19.923 --> 10:21.708
Mom let me go all out

10:21.751 --> 10:23.666
in a UK import store.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.842
Whoa, candy before
the first course?

10:25.886 --> 10:28.671
All aboard the two-parent
struggle bus.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.107
A-woo woo!

10:30.151 --> 10:31.587
Listen, if you need my help,
just --

10:31.631 --> 10:34.155
I'm fine!
Everything's fine!

10:36.810 --> 10:37.724
You already put
the candy out?

10:37.767 --> 10:39.377
Oh, I'm so sorry.

10:39.421 --> 10:41.031
I just -- I don't really
believe in courses.

10:41.075 --> 10:43.033
-I think food should be served
when you have it.

10:43.077 --> 10:44.905
Thank you
for your feedback, ma'am.

10:44.948 --> 10:47.342
-What?
-I'll be in touch.

10:47.385 --> 10:48.691
Please hold.

10:48.735 --> 10:51.172
GIRL:
Oh, hand me one of those.

10:51.215 --> 10:53.304
-Hey.
I need to talk to Mia.

10:53.348 --> 10:54.915
Weren't you just --

10:54.958 --> 10:56.046
The you-version,
not the real one.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.613
-Oh, yeah!

10:57.657 --> 10:58.962
Okay, go ahead.

10:59.006 --> 11:02.487
"Hi, I'm Mia, and I definitely
voted for Jill Stein."

11:02.531 --> 11:04.054
Mia, the last time
you were in town,

11:04.098 --> 11:07.101
you told Sophie that her bedtime
depended on "circadian rhythms"

11:07.144 --> 11:09.538
before you bolted to Cuba
to represent artist protestors.

11:09.581 --> 11:11.496
But do you know who really
deserves the protest?

11:11.540 --> 11:14.717
It's you,Mia.
It's you.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.197
Damn, Will.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.285
Oh, I am not done.
Another thing...

11:17.328 --> 11:21.419
So, um...about Mr. Roar...
hoo boy...

11:21.463 --> 11:23.204
Why does my mouth
taste like pennies?

11:23.247 --> 11:25.206
Aw, geez...so...

11:25.249 --> 11:26.424
Spit it out, Graham.

11:26.468 --> 11:27.512
I need him back!

11:27.556 --> 11:28.992
I'm so sorry.

11:29.036 --> 11:30.994
I'll give you
something else.

11:31.038 --> 11:33.954
Can I interest you
in a thousand hugs?

11:33.997 --> 11:35.738
No need. Here.

11:35.782 --> 11:38.175
Not the manners I was hoping for
at this luncheon,

11:38.219 --> 11:40.525
but it's fine.

11:44.225 --> 11:46.009
I feel gutted.

11:46.053 --> 11:48.011
DOUGLAS:
Eh, you'll get over it.

11:48.055 --> 11:49.317
All right, Miggy,
you're up.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.753
What did you do
with those sneakers?

11:50.797 --> 11:52.799
What charity saw you coming
from a mile away?

11:52.842 --> 11:54.670
Sisters of Mercy.

11:54.714 --> 11:58.239
Ah, the nuns. Every last one
of them just out for a buck.

11:58.282 --> 12:01.459
-Okay, off you go.
-Okay.

12:02.809 --> 12:03.984
Hey, have you seen Angie?

12:04.027 --> 12:06.900
Mia just said she wanted to
get Sophie "off shoes,"

12:06.943 --> 12:08.684
and I need
to dump it, fast.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.251
Yeah...
Okay, can I ask you?

12:10.294 --> 12:12.209
Is Angie's advice
about Mia working?

12:12.253 --> 12:13.428
No, not really.

12:13.471 --> 12:14.864
But maybe I'm just bad
at role-playing.

12:14.908 --> 12:15.865
I mean,
it's been said before.

12:15.909 --> 12:18.041
Nope.

12:18.085 --> 12:18.999
It's because
Angie doesn't know what the
hell she's talking about.

12:19.042 --> 12:20.783
-What?
-Look, I love that woman,

12:20.827 --> 12:22.872
but I make it a point to
never take advice from someone

12:22.916 --> 12:24.395
who buys their underwear
at CVS.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.963
I mean, I just go along with it
because it makes her feel good.

12:27.007 --> 12:29.357
In fact,
that famous girls' night,

12:29.400 --> 12:31.794
-after talking to "Ron"
for so long...
-Mm-hmm.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.491
...I left her house and
booty-called the real thing!

12:33.535 --> 12:36.016
-Poppy!
-RORY: Excuse me, grown-ups?

12:36.059 --> 12:37.800
We need to sing "Happy Birthday"
to Sophie ASAP.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.062
She's a woman
on the brink.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.282
-Louder! Faster!
-TOGETHER: ♪ Happy birthday

12:41.325 --> 12:43.850
-More British!
-♪ Dear Sophie

12:45.416 --> 12:51.031
♪ Happy birthday to you

12:52.510 --> 12:54.077
-GIRL: Whoo!
-What the what?!

12:54.121 --> 12:55.992
Earrings?!
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

12:56.036 --> 12:57.602
I'm here.
You don't need to freak out.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.866
Angie, your advice doesn't work,
and Poppy agrees with me.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.258
That "amazing girls' night"
you had?

13:01.302 --> 13:03.086
After she left your place,
she went and she boinked Ron.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.393
-Now, if you'll excuse me,

13:05.436 --> 13:08.309
an atrocity has been committed
at Claire's.

13:09.266 --> 13:11.834
Wow. Really, dude?

13:11.878 --> 13:15.620
Okay, "boinked" makes it sound
less romantic than it was.

13:15.664 --> 13:18.275
Why is there a non-biological
hole in my daughter's ear?

13:18.319 --> 13:20.321
It's a rite of passage
in many cultures...

13:20.364 --> 13:21.670
-...including where I'm from --

13:21.713 --> 13:23.193
Central New Jersey.

13:23.237 --> 13:25.892
I can't take it anymore!
You pump Sophie full of sugar.

13:25.935 --> 13:28.111
You pierce her ears without
asking my permission.

13:28.155 --> 13:30.984
You can't just show up here
and undermine everything I do.

13:31.027 --> 13:33.334
Maybe globally,what I do
is not that important.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.075
But in thishouse,
it is.

13:35.118 --> 13:37.120
And this is myhouse!
You're in my house!

13:37.164 --> 13:38.774
And so is your dumb
box of mail!

13:38.818 --> 13:40.341
Your subscription
to ELLEmagazine

13:40.384 --> 13:41.646
is no longer of use to me!

13:41.690 --> 13:44.127
And who gets that many
yoga mat catalogs?

13:44.171 --> 13:46.651
You don't even live here!

13:46.695 --> 13:49.829
You try unsubscribing
to L.L.Bean from Ghana!

13:52.744 --> 13:56.009
Whoa, shockingly good form.
You all right?

13:56.052 --> 13:59.882
Yeah.
I'm just stressed.

13:59.926 --> 14:00.927
I'm really sorry
I outed you.

14:00.970 --> 14:03.886
It's all right.
Just put flowers on my grave.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.888
-The last time Angie
was mad at me,

14:05.932 --> 14:07.237
she told me her
Uncle Joey D'Amato

14:07.281 --> 14:08.456
was "connected."

14:08.499 --> 14:10.110
-Well, that's terrifying.
-Yeah.

14:10.153 --> 14:12.068
Hey, what are you
lil' girls doing?

14:12.112 --> 14:14.679
You -- You having a sleepover
and giving each other advice

14:14.723 --> 14:16.116
because apparently
mine doesn't work?

14:16.159 --> 14:17.987
Look, Ange,
it's not your fault, all right?

14:18.031 --> 14:19.989
Will and I, we still
have to deal with our exes,

14:20.033 --> 14:21.164
but you don't.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.513
So that means
I can't give advice?

14:22.557 --> 14:23.471
-You nailed it.
-ANGIE:

14:23.514 --> 14:24.472
You know what?
I am just as --

14:24.515 --> 14:25.777
-SOPHIE: Yay!

14:25.821 --> 14:28.128
-It's my birthday!
-Sophie?

14:28.171 --> 14:30.130
-CHILD: What is she doing?
-Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
-MIA: Sophie?

14:30.173 --> 14:31.914
-SOPHIE: I'm eight!
-Sophie-Bear, come back to me.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.133
-You're scaring Mommy.
-CHILD: What is she doing?

14:33.176 --> 14:35.352
-Oof, the Creamos got her.
-What's going on?

14:35.396 --> 14:37.398
MIA: Sophie is reacting
to sugar in a way

14:37.441 --> 14:39.313
that I do not understand,
and I don't know what to do.

14:39.356 --> 14:40.923
-It's okay, everybody.
-SOPHIE: It's my birthday!

14:40.967 --> 14:42.272
I know it is, honey!
I know.

14:42.316 --> 14:43.970
Mia, I need a glass of water.

14:44.013 --> 14:45.406
-Rory, get me
a dry English muffin.
-Got it.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.582
Sophie, we're gonna count to 10
in Japanese, okay?

14:47.625 --> 14:51.281
BOTH: Ichi, ni, san, shi,

14:51.325 --> 14:53.327
go, roku,

14:53.370 --> 14:56.983
shichi, hachi, kyuu, juu.

14:57.026 --> 14:58.158
WILL: Very good.

14:58.201 --> 14:59.376
We're gonna
get off the table now.

14:59.420 --> 15:00.551
That's not safe.

15:00.595 --> 15:02.640
All right, everybody.
We're all better.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.164
You guys finish your cake,
and then we'll play

15:04.207 --> 15:05.992
Pin the Ruff
on the Beefeater.

15:14.217 --> 15:15.523
Thank you, Will.

15:15.566 --> 15:17.003
Of course.

15:17.046 --> 15:21.311
No, seriously, thank you.
I had no idea what to do.

15:21.355 --> 15:23.313
I mean, the first thing
that came to mind was,

15:23.357 --> 15:25.011
-"Do I change her diaper?"

15:25.054 --> 15:26.360
It's just every time
I see her,

15:26.403 --> 15:29.102
I feel like she's become
this whole new person

15:29.145 --> 15:31.582
that I have to get to know,
like, all over again.

15:31.626 --> 15:34.107
Yeah, I sometimes feel that
between lunch and dinner.

15:35.282 --> 15:36.587
You know, I hate

15:36.631 --> 15:39.460
that I make you feel like
what you do isn't important.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.984
I get to swoop in
and be this fun mom.

15:42.028 --> 15:44.682
Meanwhile,
you're with her every day,

15:44.726 --> 15:47.424
making rules and --
and washing her hair.

15:47.468 --> 15:51.994
Thank you.
I don't say that enough.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.431
Well, you did
send that e-mail

15:54.475 --> 15:56.433
that said
"You da best!" last week.

15:57.695 --> 15:59.654
But thanks,
I appreciate it.

16:01.134 --> 16:04.659
Attention, parents, I'd like
to make an announcement --

16:04.702 --> 16:08.228
I thought I could handle that
amount of sugar, but I cannot.

16:08.271 --> 16:10.143
Things were said,
and I apologize.

16:10.186 --> 16:12.014
-You're forgiven.
-It's my fault.

16:12.058 --> 16:14.799
Look, I love
having two parents,

16:14.843 --> 16:18.151
but sometimes
it's hard on me,

16:18.194 --> 16:21.676
and I wish we had more memories
of the three of us.

16:21.719 --> 16:26.072
Because we are family,
even if we don't live together.

16:26.115 --> 16:29.292
Oh, honey,
of course we are.

16:29.336 --> 16:30.380
I love you.

16:36.212 --> 16:39.476
Hey, um, does someone
need to drive her home?

16:39.520 --> 16:42.697
Louisa.
Why are you so quiet?

16:42.740 --> 16:45.091
I'm more of a listener.

16:49.312 --> 16:50.922
-Who dis?
-DOUGLAS: It's Douglas.

16:50.966 --> 16:52.663
What happened
with the nuns?

16:52.707 --> 16:54.274
My buddy Dwayne
bought my kicks.

16:54.317 --> 16:55.231
He saw my Insta story

16:55.275 --> 16:57.320
about what a good person
I am for donating them.

16:57.364 --> 16:59.192
Okay, real men
don't have "buddies."

16:59.235 --> 17:01.846
Okay, now go be a man
and get your shoes back.

17:01.890 --> 17:05.198
I tried, but I ended up giving
him the pair I was wearing

17:05.241 --> 17:07.722
and a baggie of Goldfish
I had in my pocket.

17:07.765 --> 17:09.680
-That's it.
I'm coming down there.
-I'll text you the address.

17:09.724 --> 17:11.639
DOUGLAS: No, no, no. No.
No texting.

17:11.682 --> 17:14.207
Form the words in your head,
drop them to the mouth,

17:14.250 --> 17:15.643
and shout 'em out
into the world

17:15.686 --> 17:17.993
like a normal
friggin' human being.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.300
Can you repeat that?
It was a lot.

17:25.479 --> 17:28.482
-Ange? You up
for a girls' night?

17:28.525 --> 17:29.918
I got gas station
caffeine pills.

17:31.311 --> 17:32.268
Are you still mad at me?

17:32.312 --> 17:36.316
No, I'm not mad-mad.
It's just...

17:36.359 --> 17:38.361
why didn't you tell me
about Ron?

17:38.405 --> 17:40.146
You're a very scary woman.

17:40.189 --> 17:42.365
Plus, I didn't want you to think
I was still a mess

17:42.409 --> 17:44.280
after all those nights
I spent on your couch.

17:45.499 --> 17:47.327
You're the strongest person
I know.

17:47.370 --> 17:49.242
Thanks.

17:49.285 --> 17:54.334
It's just...even though
I never had a husband,

17:54.377 --> 17:56.597
I like to be the person
you come to with that stuff.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.382
And you always will be,
whether I listen to you or not.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.906
That's why
we have girls' night.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.823
- Mm, I love you.
-I love you.

18:08.435 --> 18:11.394
Okay, so...
how was it with Ron?

18:11.438 --> 18:13.396
Girl, I've been waiting
three years to tell you.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.746
It was as good as it could be

18:15.790 --> 18:19.228
in a parked car outside of
his girlfriend's house.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.536
-I'm gonna get the beer funnel.
-POPPY: Please.

18:22.579 --> 18:24.494
I've only
waited in line once --

18:24.538 --> 18:27.236
December 1, 1974.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.803
Bills-Colts tickets.

18:28.846 --> 18:32.023
It was so cold,
my sister Donna lost a toe.

18:32.067 --> 18:33.547
May she rest in peace.

18:33.590 --> 18:36.811
-Okay, so which one is Dwayne?
-Hold up.

18:36.854 --> 18:38.247
I don't think you know what
you're getting into with Dwayne.

18:38.291 --> 18:39.596
The guy's an evil genius.

18:39.640 --> 18:42.033
You know, like Elon Musk
or Kickeeboy.

18:42.077 --> 18:44.035
Who's Kickeeboy?

18:44.079 --> 18:45.298
Oh, that guy
eating a snow cone.

18:45.341 --> 18:46.821
DOUGLAS: Ah.

18:46.864 --> 18:48.562
I think I can handle it.

18:48.605 --> 18:51.304
Hey, I hear you got
my friend's tennis shoes,

18:51.347 --> 18:53.262
so why don't you
just give them back?

18:53.306 --> 18:55.046
Oh, are you one of those
old parent people

18:55.090 --> 18:56.657
Miggy hangs out with now?

18:56.700 --> 19:00.269
I'm Dr. Douglas Fogerty,
and this conversation

19:00.313 --> 19:02.837
has already gone on longer
than I care for,

19:02.880 --> 19:04.317
so why don't you just
give me the shoes?

19:04.360 --> 19:07.233
Nah. These are Nike Air Max
90 Corks, man!

19:07.276 --> 19:08.756
The most coveted pair
of shoes

19:08.799 --> 19:10.323
in all of Pennsyl-Dwaynia.

19:10.366 --> 19:11.411
Keeping 'em.

19:11.454 --> 19:13.413
A man only needs
four pairs of shoes --

19:13.456 --> 19:15.023
dress loafers, deck shoes,

19:15.066 --> 19:18.069
sturdy topsiders,
and golf spikes.

19:18.113 --> 19:19.419
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.812
I'm gonna give you
what you paid for the shoes,

19:21.856 --> 19:23.423
and I'm gonna kick in
an extra Andrew.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.425
Honestly, man, it's not even
about the Corks.

19:25.468 --> 19:26.948
It's about Miggy.

19:26.991 --> 19:28.645
These kicks remind me of
the old days with that dude --

19:28.689 --> 19:30.038
skateboarding,

19:30.081 --> 19:32.432
him helping me write
flirty texts to Gina,

19:32.475 --> 19:34.434
him helping me write
breakup texts to Gina.

19:34.477 --> 19:36.436
Doesn't seem like
it went great with Gina.

19:36.479 --> 19:37.828
Miggy and I had
the best times.

19:37.872 --> 19:39.221
Waiting in line
for Yeezys,

19:39.265 --> 19:41.267
before Kanye made them
hella problematic.

19:41.310 --> 19:42.485
Going to the dog park,

19:42.529 --> 19:45.009
then getting kicked out
for not having a dog.

19:45.053 --> 19:50.014
Before he got busy with dad
world, Miggy was there for me.

19:50.058 --> 19:53.192
In line, in life.

19:54.323 --> 19:57.283
But now, he's giving all that
solid gold friendship to you

19:57.326 --> 19:59.285
and I got squat.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.461
You're so lucky, man.

20:03.550 --> 20:04.725
Peekaboo!

20:04.768 --> 20:08.163
Yeah, he's a good egg.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.122
So, those slippers Gucci?

20:14.300 --> 20:16.693
Yo, no one's ever
stood up for me before.

20:16.737 --> 20:18.042
So, how'd it -- Damn!

20:18.086 --> 20:19.914
You got Dwayne'd.

20:19.957 --> 20:22.395
Yo! See you soon, Miggy!

20:22.438 --> 20:25.093
Man, looks like Dwayne
got everything from you.

20:25.136 --> 20:26.660
And I know
you just hate that,

20:26.703 --> 20:28.314
giving without getting
anything back.

20:28.357 --> 20:29.880
It was a fair trade.

20:29.924 --> 20:31.404
-Glass.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.188
-That was a shard of glass.
-Oh.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.276
-Oh, no.
-Yeah.

20:37.453 --> 20:40.935
All right, so let's rehearse.
I'm pitching double peace signs,

20:40.978 --> 20:43.894
devil horns, and then,
if there's time, upside down?

20:46.462 --> 20:48.421
-Those are gonna be awesome.

20:48.464 --> 20:50.640
I'm gonna go grab us
some mozzarella sticks.

20:50.684 --> 20:54.209
If it's okay with both
my parents, of course.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.342
Well, it's still
your birthday,

20:56.385 --> 20:59.519
and you're not
in a coma yet...

20:59.562 --> 21:00.955
so I say go for it.

21:00.998 --> 21:02.435
Hey, should we do one
just the two of us?

21:02.478 --> 21:03.827
You know, for Sophie.

21:03.871 --> 21:05.307
She doesn't have a ton
of photos of us together.

21:05.351 --> 21:08.310
I mean, everyone has a camera
in their pocket, but sure.

21:08.354 --> 21:09.920
I'll pay $3
to sit in a closet.
