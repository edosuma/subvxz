JACKASS 3.5

02:49.378 --> 02:52.495
Hello, my name is Johnny Knoxville.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.750
Welcome to Jackass!

03:04.851 --> 03:06.091
Thank you very much.

03:09.564 --> 03:10.644
People are always asking me,

03:10.732 --> 03:13.223
"Is there anything
that you just wouldn't do?"

03:13.318 --> 03:14.558
Well, this is it.

03:14.653 --> 03:16.189
It's the Alligator Snapping Turtle,

03:16.279 --> 03:18.315
probably the meanest thing
I'll have ever done to my butt.

03:18.407 --> 03:20.693
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

03:20.784 --> 03:22.024
Fuck!

03:23.662 --> 03:25.744
Don't look at him, Steve-O.
Don't look at him.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.571
-Look at him.
-Don't look at him.

03:27.666 --> 03:28.781
Relax, relax.

03:30.085 --> 03:31.245
Don't look at it.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.457
Look at it.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.552
Shit!

03:42.639 --> 03:44.846
Fuck! God damn it!

03:46.059 --> 03:47.299
-Fuck!
-Relax.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.431
-Relax!
-Relax. Just relax.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.062
-Hold your ground.
-Okay.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.266
-Fuck, that must hurt really bad.
-Shit.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.692
-Fuck.
-Are you okay?

03:59.614 --> 04:01.354
-Mama.
-Fuck.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.483
Okay, now he's just no
gonna fucking let go?

04:04.578 --> 04:07.365
I knew this was fucking gonna happen!
He's not letting go!

04:07.789 --> 04:10.326
-Shit.
-Relax. You need to relax.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.452
Fuck!

04:11.543 --> 04:14.080
-The turtle's the problem.
-I'm relaxed! Shit!

04:14.171 --> 04:16.786
This would be horrifying if...

04:16.882 --> 04:18.338
-Relax.
-Relax.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.290
-Okay.
-Relax?

04:20.385 --> 04:22.967
-Who could relax?
-I'm just gonna...

04:23.054 --> 04:24.840
You son...

04:25.640 --> 04:26.971
Jeez, relax, relax.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.798
-Shit!
-Hold it together. Don't pull.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.759
-Don't pull.
-Don't pull.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.186
-It doesn't wanna let go.
-God!

04:33.273 --> 04:35.229
-Oh, my God.
-Fuck!

04:36.568 --> 04:38.149
That was horrifying.

04:38.236 --> 04:39.817
Wow.

04:39.905 --> 04:43.068
-Get him out of here.
-Son of a bitch!

04:43.533 --> 04:44.773
Oh, my God.

04:46.161 --> 04:47.992
He got you good.

04:48.079 --> 04:49.489
Yeah.

04:50.081 --> 04:54.916
There's a reason why I turned that down
for so many years.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.672
I can't see anything!

05:08.767 --> 05:10.803
-Spread your legs.
-Let go. Let go. Drop.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.430
You're good.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.934
You all right?

05:22.656 --> 05:23.896
You want a donut?

05:25.951 --> 05:27.612
This is Barrel Surfing.

05:27.702 --> 05:31.069
Big-barrel surfing's for macho jerks
with a death wish.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.201
No, it's not. It's the ultimate thrill,
the ultimate rush.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.873
Even more than sex.

05:35.961 --> 05:39.078
Well, that depends
on who you're doing it with.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.265
That was pretty good.

06:18.295 --> 06:19.785
Hold them!

06:23.842 --> 06:25.924
I think Bam was great
at it the first time,

06:26.011 --> 06:29.094
and now Dunn's stepped in
to up the failure rate

06:29.180 --> 06:31.421
to an all-time high.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.515
Oh, my God.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.905
I've got a pile of shit in my nose.

06:49.993 --> 06:52.609
I'm Ryan Dunn. This is face surfing.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.494
That scene done yet?

07:11.056 --> 07:14.640
Being on set is 50% fun as hell,

07:14.726 --> 07:17.889
and the other 50%
is just pure anxiety, paranoia...

07:18.730 --> 07:21.767
-Jesus.
-Oh, God.

07:21.858 --> 07:25.521
The only thing I care about
is that it's fucking wet down here.

07:25.820 --> 07:29.779
Shooting a Jackass movie,
it seems super fun,

07:29.866 --> 07:31.447
but it's actually hell

07:31.534 --> 07:34.071
because everyone
is trying to get everyone.

07:34.204 --> 07:38.573
In particular, me, because I've been
a dick to everyone the whole time.

07:44.798 --> 07:48.507
It gets very tense on set
when we're filming Jackass.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.049
You're always
looking over your shoulder.

07:50.136 --> 07:53.094
You just know something horrible
is gonna happen to you.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.137
And it's not like it might. It will.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.759
It's a snapping turtle on a stick.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.985
Fucking with Ehren
is the best thing ever.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.611
Where's he at right now?
I wanna pee on him or something.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.610
Ehren's in there sleeping.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.538
We got Ghetto Defibrillators.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.537
Clear!

08:31.011 --> 08:33.001
Fuck you!

08:38.727 --> 08:40.558
I was worried about you.

08:40.645 --> 08:41.725
Didn't know if you'd died.

08:41.813 --> 08:44.475
I know. You were in here
snoring for three hours, dude.

08:44.566 --> 08:45.601
We didn't know if you'd died.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.523
It's all right. We're doctors.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.819
You guys are dicks.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.113
Can't somebody sleep a little bit
around here?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.862
No. That's the whole point.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.909
Sure, you can sleep.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.414
You know that if you're being pranked,
if it's a good prank,

09:07.505 --> 09:08.915
it's gonna end up in the movie.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.747
And footage is footage.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.709
But definitely, tensions get hot.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.178
And you never know what's gonna happen.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.641
He's not anywhere near you.

09:21.728 --> 09:25.346
He's hiding behind a motherfucking
chain-link fence.

09:25.440 --> 09:28.056
A chain-link fence.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.267
That's worse than this.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.448
He's gonna fucking try
and Rocky my ass right now.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.254
Hey, hey!

09:53.843 --> 09:55.959
Guys, stop.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.295
Stop.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.678
Stop, stop, stop. Come on.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.600
It's cool. Come on.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.727
-What was the name of that bit?
-Chill.

10:06.815 --> 10:07.895
I don't know.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.598
-"Fighting Each Other"?
-"Fight!"

10:10.693 --> 10:12.149
I'm telling you,
it's nerve-racking, dude.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.943
You gotta let out some aggression.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.946
Man, it is nerve-racking as hell.

10:17.951 --> 10:22.445
'Cause 24/7, when we're shooting, all
of us are always attacking each other.

10:22.539 --> 10:25.906
I may be attacking everyone
a little more.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.245
-Fuck!
-What the fuck was that?

10:32.590 --> 10:36.549
I saw a Buster Keaton film where
he had a mini cannon tied to his foot,

10:36.636 --> 10:40.003
and he couldn't get it off his foot.

10:40.098 --> 10:42.384
And I thought it looked funny.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.431
And so, we had one built.

10:44.602 --> 10:45.637
Here.

10:45.728 --> 10:48.595
One of the funniest times
is when I walked up behind Ehren

10:48.690 --> 10:50.897
with the mini cannon,
and I was dressed as a pirate.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.724
Get up and go.

10:53.444 --> 10:56.311
And he kept moving
and I had to keep repositioning,

10:56.406 --> 10:59.648
and finally,
he turns around and busts me.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.950
And so, I have to walk this mini cannon
out of frame,

11:06.040 --> 11:09.703
very un-sneakily,
and it was really awkward.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.793
But he just...
Five minutes, hyper-vigilant,

11:13.756 --> 11:15.542
five minutes goes by,
he forgets about it,

11:15.633 --> 11:18.466
and then I shoot him in the ass.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.478
Fuck, that hurt.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.309
-You got it.
-Asshole.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.564
-Ehren.
-He got us, too.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.564
Shit. Right in the neck.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.774
Arr you mad at me?

11:46.331 --> 11:47.571
What's the bit here, Wee?

11:47.665 --> 11:50.498
All right. So, today, Street Bike Tommy

11:50.585 --> 11:54.203
is gonna come down this ramp
looking like a bowling ball,

11:54.589 --> 11:58.377
launch into all of us standing out here

11:58.676 --> 12:00.917
as the human pins, and knock us down.

12:01.012 --> 12:03.298
-Do I look like the tenpin?
-You do look like the tenpin.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.095
-That's what I am.
-Awesome.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.094
It's pretty slippery out there.

12:07.185 --> 12:09.927
Yeah, and the reason
it's slippery out there,

12:10.021 --> 12:12.353
that's sex lube.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.021
Lube it up, boys.

12:17.695 --> 12:20.482
So, we're getting ready to do a bit
called the Slip 'n' Bowl,

12:20.573 --> 12:23.531
but really, it's just a big ruse to
get all the guys in the middle

12:23.618 --> 12:28.112
of a big, slippery mess, so we can fly
a remote-controlled helicopter in

12:28.206 --> 12:32.040
that has paintball guns
mounted on either side.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.874
It's gonna suck.

12:34.629 --> 12:36.915
Here we go. Quiet, please.

12:37.048 --> 12:38.959
All right. Get your goggles on, guys.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.166
-Goggles on, guys.
-Let's get the intro.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.462
Action!

12:42.929 --> 12:45.966
I'm Street Bike Tommy,
and this is Slip 'n' Bowl.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.513
Go!

13:26.139 --> 13:28.346
I'm almost feeling bad now.

13:39.444 --> 13:40.934
Shit!

13:45.450 --> 13:47.281
Fucking shit!

13:52.957 --> 13:54.367
Fuck!

13:58.129 --> 13:59.494
Fucking assholes.

14:00.465 --> 14:01.705
Fuck.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.164
-Who is that?
-Who is that?

14:03.259 --> 14:04.715
-Dave.
-Dave England.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.043
-That's so...
-Fuck.

14:07.138 --> 14:08.469
Oh, my God.

14:08.556 --> 14:11.923
This whole thing was
just a big, elaborate ruse

14:12.018 --> 14:13.724
to get you on something slippery.

14:13.811 --> 14:14.926
I heard the noise and I was like,

14:15.021 --> 14:16.557
"Are you guys cool
with this, like, sound?"

14:16.647 --> 14:19.059
-Yeah, I was thinking...
-And then, all of a sudden, I saw

14:19.150 --> 14:21.607
-the camera, and I was like...
-I wasn't in the bit.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.275
I wasn't around, and I'm like,

14:23.363 --> 14:25.069
"If they see me not around,
they're gonna get suspicious."

14:25.156 --> 14:26.396
Everything was obvious.

14:26.491 --> 14:29.073
That's what I was worried about
not going too fast

14:29.160 --> 14:30.821
'cause I didn't want you...

14:31.496 --> 14:34.158
I don't want you to fall...

14:39.420 --> 14:41.786
The joke's on you now, boy.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.878
I actually deserve that.

14:49.514 --> 14:52.005
So we have a dick rocket, and
we're gonna launch it into Bam's ass,

14:52.100 --> 14:53.965
AKA Uranus.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.097
-It's science.
-We've been waiting for years

14:57.188 --> 14:59.144
for technology to catch up with us.

14:59.232 --> 15:02.645
Finally, we've got this contraption.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.643
We're gonna send this cock rocket
straight to Uranus.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.820
-You ready?
-Are you ready?

15:07.907 --> 15:08.942
Let's do it.

15:09.659 --> 15:13.993
Three, two, one, blast off!

15:17.583 --> 15:19.323
Don't point that thing at me.

15:25.550 --> 15:28.292
Okay, so we didn't get quite up there,

15:28.386 --> 15:30.251
but it happens to a lot of guys.

15:31.556 --> 15:32.591
Doesn't it, Ryan?

15:33.057 --> 15:34.547
Bam, you ready?

15:35.435 --> 15:36.641
Three,

15:36.727 --> 15:37.842
two,

15:37.937 --> 15:39.052
one,

15:39.147 --> 15:41.354
blast off!

15:45.862 --> 15:47.477
Shit.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.401
What's going on, Bam?

15:50.491 --> 15:51.901
Now, they have a lighter dildo

15:53.661 --> 15:57.574
which seems like it would be better,
but, no.

15:57.665 --> 16:01.249
It means it's gonna go so much faster
into my ass,

16:01.335 --> 16:03.576
and it's gonna not feel very great.

16:04.505 --> 16:07.963
So, we had to switch cocks.
Hopefully, this one will work.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.085
It's a big, old cock.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.008
Three,

16:11.095 --> 16:12.175
two,

16:12.263 --> 16:13.673
one,

16:13.764 --> 16:16.221
blast off!

16:26.777 --> 16:28.768
Did you like it?

16:28.863 --> 16:30.023
Fuck, no.

16:31.199 --> 16:35.363
One small step for man,
one giant leap for that sweet ass.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.868
Jesus. You can't see shit
in these things.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.247
Check it out.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.708
Yeah.

16:50.801 --> 16:53.668
This is the Magna-Goggles.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.681
Oh, my God. Hold on.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.760
-All right. Go.
-Okay.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.469
Wait, let me aim you first.

17:03.606 --> 17:04.891
Okay.

17:05.066 --> 17:06.226
-All right.
-Yeah?

17:06.317 --> 17:07.352
-Just go.
-Okay.

17:07.443 --> 17:08.728
Go.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.362
Go!

17:18.119 --> 17:19.155
I'm sorry, bro

17:19.579 --> 17:21.286
No you're not.

17:21.624 --> 17:25.242
You ready to run a down and in pattern
about five yards out and across?

17:25.336 --> 17:28.248
-Absolutely.
-All right. Give Preston a high five.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.455
-Yes. All right.
-Come on.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.165
These things suck.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.051
Hut, hut!

17:42.019 --> 17:43.099
Fuck!

17:47.024 --> 17:48.889
-Where did that get you?
-Right in the nose.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.357
Shit.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.067
-You got this.
-I got this?

17:52.154 --> 17:53.860
-Come on, Dunn.
-Yeah.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.405
-Come on, Dunn.
-Let them have it.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.194
Shit.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.616
Wee Man is fun to dress up, period.

18:06.711 --> 18:09.373
He just looks cute in anything
you put him in.

18:09.880 --> 18:10.915
Preston, too.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.046
This is Snow Tubing.

18:23.686 --> 18:26.268
I fucking kicked him in the face.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.186
-Kicked him in the face?
-I kicked him in the face.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.730
Kicked him right here.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.232
Frosty, he's bleeding a little.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.604
This just ain't Frosty's day. Fuck.

18:50.421 --> 18:52.537
That's one dumb reindeer.

19:08.564 --> 19:09.724
Dude, this is screwed up.

19:16.447 --> 19:18.688
That was good.

19:18.783 --> 19:19.898
Can you help me up?

19:21.243 --> 19:24.861
I saw this bit on
America's Funniest Home Videos.

19:24.955 --> 19:28.197
Two kids run at a tree

19:28.292 --> 19:30.999
with a 15-foot-long stick

19:31.087 --> 19:33.999
on either end,
and they hit the tree in the middle,

19:34.090 --> 19:36.206
and it just sends them flying
when they hit the tree.

19:37.051 --> 19:40.714
Basically, we're gonna try to clothesline
ourselves with this two-by-four.

19:40.805 --> 19:44.423
And it's downhill, and Dunn's
gonna be landing in horse shit,

19:44.517 --> 19:46.473
-so I don't think...
-Thank you for pointing that out for me.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.891
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

19:47.978 --> 19:51.015
Why do you think I've been favoring
over here the whole time?

19:51.107 --> 19:53.644
I didn't notice I have a big pile
of horse shit to land in.

19:53.734 --> 19:54.940
Awesome.

19:55.778 --> 19:56.858
This is the Blowback.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.402
Shit.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.281
-Fuck.
-Awesome.

20:03.369 --> 20:04.984
Fucking stupid bullshit.

20:05.871 --> 20:06.906
-That was great.
-I liked it.

20:06.997 --> 20:08.328
"That was great"?

20:08.416 --> 20:09.872
Did you guys stand there beforehand
and go,

20:09.959 --> 20:11.665
"Let's just be enthusiastic
and encourage this thing"?

20:11.752 --> 20:13.617
No no. That looks funny.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.499
-That looks good.
-Yeah, man.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.671
I wish you guys had a dick cam
'cause that's where that pole went.

20:17.758 --> 20:18.998
That was rad.

20:19.176 --> 20:22.043
It's such a dumb idea
'cause you have to choreograph it

20:22.138 --> 20:23.799
so you're both doing it
at the exact same time.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.174
You both weigh the same.

20:25.516 --> 20:27.632
It was destined for failure
from the get-go,

20:27.727 --> 20:29.718
but we kept on trying it
'cause we're stupid.

20:30.438 --> 20:31.928
Nobody wants to jump in?

20:32.022 --> 20:33.057
No.

20:33.691 --> 20:34.771
I'm just saying.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.895
I don't know. I'm feeling sorry for you.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.601
Really painful thing,

20:38.696 --> 20:40.152
low payoff.

20:41.282 --> 20:42.613
Yeah.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.065
Just do it again.

20:45.494 --> 20:46.609
Take two.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.536
-This is the Blowback.
-Shit.

20:56.297 --> 20:57.377
I hate it.

20:57.465 --> 20:59.751
Some things just don't translate
to camera.

20:59.842 --> 21:01.252
Yeah?

21:01.844 --> 21:04.210
ldeally, you want something
that doesn't hurt,

21:04.305 --> 21:06.045
but looks really bad.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.677
This is a whole other story.
The opposite.

21:09.435 --> 21:13.348
At least we busted it,
so we can't try it again.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.725
You tried it with Knoxville
and he sliced his hand open.

21:15.816 --> 21:16.896
You could see his bone.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.645
That ain't my fault.

21:18.736 --> 21:20.567
I know. It's the Blowback's fault.

21:20.654 --> 21:21.894
Dumb Blowback.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.452
That hurt worse than when it...

21:35.669 --> 21:38.581
It's out of frame. Turn this way
so everyone's out of frame.

21:38.756 --> 21:39.962
It's stinging.

21:40.758 --> 21:43.420
For a bit that doesn't work,
that fucking thing sucks.

21:43.886 --> 21:45.046
All right, take a big breath.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.048
You can do this.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.879
Not too bad, right?

21:51.018 --> 21:53.259
All right. It's gonna numb up.

21:53.896 --> 21:56.103
A little burn, perhaps.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.181
That camera on?

21:58.609 --> 22:01.271
All right. If you have pain, tell me.
I'll get you more numbing medicine.

22:01.362 --> 22:03.193
I know you're the type
that's not gonna tell me

22:03.280 --> 22:05.942
'cause you don't want any more shots.

22:07.117 --> 22:09.950
All right.
Let me get this thing closed up.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.618
Fuck off.

22:17.294 --> 22:18.374
I'm Brandon Novak,

22:18.796 --> 22:21.287
and this is Doo Doo Falls.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.046
-You okay?
-Fuck.

22:31.475 --> 22:34.433
Thank God for that fucking helmet.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.385
Dude, I hit my head so hard,

22:36.480 --> 22:39.222
it honestly saved my life.

22:43.988 --> 22:46.570
Did you make dookie on yourself?

22:46.657 --> 22:47.988
Yeah.

22:48.826 --> 22:50.817
He just shit his pants.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.902
But if anyone deserves
to shit their pants,

22:52.997 --> 22:55.534
it's you for doing that.

22:55.666 --> 22:57.452
-Wipe your shitty ass.
-You wipe it.

22:57.543 --> 23:00.376
-Why do I gotta wipe it?
-'Cause I can't move right now.

23:01.839 --> 23:03.795
No no

23:04.800 --> 23:06.165
Why so rough?

23:09.471 --> 23:11.052
Fucking asshole.

23:15.519 --> 23:18.386
-What are you doing, Ryan?
-Painting lips on the chick.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.812
For the kiss.
What does it look like I'm doing?

23:22.192 --> 23:24.649
All right. Hang on. Okay, go.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.523
Steve-O, in a little bit more.

23:28.490 --> 23:31.698
We're here with Mark Zupan,
and this is the Kissing Booth.

23:35.873 --> 23:37.955
That was great.

23:38.042 --> 23:39.703
P., that was gold.

23:39.793 --> 23:41.203
Oh, my God.

23:41.295 --> 23:43.786
-You all right?
-Make it happy.

23:43.881 --> 23:45.917
Yay! Nice kiss.

23:46.008 --> 23:48.294
Big, old kiss. She's hot.

23:48.636 --> 23:50.376
Yeah.

23:52.890 --> 23:55.632
The Phantom camera was so fun,
especially for Jackass

23:55.726 --> 23:57.387
where we had a lot of impact.

23:57.478 --> 23:59.969
It shoots so slow that one second
on the Phantom camera

24:00.064 --> 24:01.474
is like 40 seconds.

24:01.732 --> 24:05.441
Preston is your ideal guy
to shoot Phantom on.

24:05.611 --> 24:08.523
Even a skinny guy,
if you hit him in the face,

24:08.614 --> 24:10.650
you'll see the face come off the skull.

24:10.908 --> 24:12.864
But the fatter you are,

24:12.952 --> 24:18.072
the more rippling and waving it gets.
It's just gonna roll and look crazy.

24:18.916 --> 24:20.747
I fell in love with the Phantom camera.

24:21.919 --> 24:25.252
I was just thinking,
when I just put Wee Man,

24:25.589 --> 24:27.454
his naked ass
with his balls hanging down,

24:27.549 --> 24:30.416
and I threw a tennis ball at his balls.

24:32.388 --> 24:34.720
Man, there are certain things
that look really great.

24:34.807 --> 24:38.470
Anything Pontius does with his pee-pee
is funny on the Phantom camera.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.226
When we found the Phantom camera,
we started writing

24:45.317 --> 24:46.648
bits for it left and right.

24:51.949 --> 24:54.281
I'm Danger Ehren,
and I'm about to go fishing.

24:58.622 --> 25:01.989
It really captures what happens
when you get hit in the face.

25:02.459 --> 25:04.575
You sure it's not just gonna hit me
right in the front of the face?

25:04.670 --> 25:06.126
-Yes, I got you.
-All right.

25:06.213 --> 25:08.078
I'm not gonna hit you in the front
of the face. I got you.

25:08.173 --> 25:10.710
All right, guys, come on. We're rolling.

25:10.801 --> 25:12.166
When was the last time
you took a fish to the head?

25:12.594 --> 25:15.051
I haven't taken a fish to the head
in a long -ass time.

25:15.139 --> 25:16.504
Why?

25:22.146 --> 25:24.057
I missed.

25:24.148 --> 25:25.479
Fuck.

25:34.283 --> 25:36.740
I told you I wasn't gonna hit your nose.

25:38.954 --> 25:39.989
What are your predictions?

25:40.080 --> 25:41.945
How many walls do you think
he's gonna get through?

25:42.499 --> 25:44.285
So, that's the object here?

25:47.379 --> 25:50.667
Two and the beginning of the third one.

25:50.758 --> 25:52.669
I'm with you. What's your predictio

25:52.760 --> 25:55.843
Two and a bump into the third one,
with no damage to the third one.

25:55.929 --> 25:59.262
-He's too light. He's only a buck 60...
-He's a buck 60.

25:59.349 --> 26:02.091
-He's too light. He can't smash through.
-Then maybe you should go down there.

26:02.186 --> 26:03.767
I'm not going there.

26:06.023 --> 26:08.230
-Are you okay?
-No.

26:10.027 --> 26:11.858
Oh, my God.

26:15.449 --> 26:16.484
All right.

26:17.117 --> 26:18.653
I love you.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.615
For the love of fuck's sake,

26:22.706 --> 26:24.537
this is Drywall Drop-In.

26:36.553 --> 26:38.384
-Are you all right? Shit.
-Yeah, I'm fine.

26:38.472 --> 26:39.587
You okay? Are you okay?

26:39.681 --> 26:42.673
-Yeah.
-You have drywall in your mouth.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.258
Watch out. There's nails.

26:44.353 --> 26:45.559
-Okay.
-We'll get them off.

26:45.896 --> 26:47.887
It looked especially funny
when you hit the walls.

26:47.981 --> 26:49.437
You did good.

26:51.985 --> 26:53.691
-Was it neat?
-It was neat-o.

26:53.821 --> 26:55.777
Good. Just so long as it was neat.

26:55.864 --> 26:57.729
Yeah. Way to go.

26:59.493 --> 27:00.778
Who's Darf?

27:01.745 --> 27:03.986
Darf is a friend of mine,

27:04.081 --> 27:06.447
a friend of ours that we no longer see.

27:06.542 --> 27:10.080
Darf is when Dave is blacked-out drunk,
and he's the worst.

27:10.170 --> 27:13.628
He's the worst of any of the guys.
When he's drunk, he's the worst.

27:13.715 --> 27:18.505
Apparently, from what I hear,
jf I drink too much,

27:18.595 --> 27:21.007
I turn into a different person,
named Darf,

27:21.098 --> 27:22.508
who's a total asshole

27:22.599 --> 27:25.762
that just goes around doing
as many horrible things as he can.

27:26.186 --> 27:29.770
And Darf showed up one night
in Northern California at a bar.

27:30.524 --> 27:32.810
Everyone wanted to kick his ass.

27:34.319 --> 27:35.980
I was told the next day,
I got my wiener out

27:36.071 --> 27:37.436
and I put mustard all over it,

27:37.531 --> 27:39.567
which is called the Portland Frank.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.320
And I was like,
"There's no way I did that."

27:42.411 --> 27:44.151
And I pulled my pants down,

27:44.246 --> 27:46.077
and it was all mustard-y.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.575
The next morning we get up,

27:47.666 --> 27:49.952
and whose name
is on top of the stunt list?

27:50.043 --> 27:51.749
Dave England.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.877
This is where Dave stands up
on the back of a horse

27:53.964 --> 27:55.170
and throws a parachute up?

27:55.257 --> 27:56.588
Yes.

27:56.675 --> 27:57.835
Will it work?

27:57.926 --> 27:59.336
I hope not.

28:02.097 --> 28:06.887
Well, after his performance yesterday,
I figured he was due for a stunt today.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.182
Here we go. Okay.

28:11.273 --> 28:13.309
Man, you got some alcohol
on your breath, still.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.640
Sorry.

28:18.906 --> 28:21.022
All right, we're good to go.

28:21.325 --> 28:24.237
I'm here with Judd Leffew,
and this is Bareback Base Jumping.

28:28.498 --> 28:30.329
Here we go.

28:33.378 --> 28:34.458
Pull!

28:40.802 --> 28:42.793
Where's the parachute?

28:45.098 --> 28:47.054
Dave was a drunk piece of shit
last night,

28:47.142 --> 28:48.882
and we're a little bit mad at him,

28:48.977 --> 28:51.639
so I think we're gonna get this
in at least 10, 15 more times.

28:52.481 --> 28:54.813
You almost got it, Dave.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.111
Drop!

29:14.503 --> 29:18.416
Just one more and I should be happy.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.207
Oh, man.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.933
It has to be soft...

29:32.020 --> 29:34.932
-The soft stuff's over here!
-Oh, my God!

29:35.357 --> 29:36.392
Fucking hell!

29:36.775 --> 29:39.437
I love how you completely missed
the softer dirt,

29:39.528 --> 29:41.109
and just went for the hard stuff.

29:41.196 --> 29:44.359
Hey, look, it's hard to plan
when you're floating way up high.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.940
-It's hard to spot your landing.
-You actually didn't float that long.

29:47.035 --> 29:49.401
I thought I was gonna get caught
in those trees.

29:49.871 --> 29:52.453
I think Dave did
the horse parachute thing

29:52.541 --> 29:54.532
eight times, nine times that day.

29:54.793 --> 29:55.908
Did you ever feel bad for him?

29:56.003 --> 29:59.040
No. I've never felt bad
for Dave England in any situation.

30:09.683 --> 30:13.892
We got a whole lot of diet cola
and a bunch of peppermint candies.

30:14.271 --> 30:16.512
This is Bombs Away.

30:18.608 --> 30:20.894
-Shit!
-Creepy-ass shit.

30:21.236 --> 30:22.897
You're playing with a live grenade,
my friend.

30:25.407 --> 30:26.988
Bombs away!

30:46.094 --> 30:47.834
Fuck you!

31:37.729 --> 31:40.562
Look at all the fucking dents
behind Lance.

31:40.649 --> 31:43.106
-Where were you, Lance?
-I was right here.

31:57.416 --> 31:58.747
That looks great.

31:59.626 --> 32:03.619
Early on, Knoxville found this thing
online where this Chinese artist

32:03.922 --> 32:07.506
paints himself into backgrounds
really intricately.

32:08.009 --> 32:10.591
And so,
we knew that was the start of an idea,

32:10.679 --> 32:13.341
just how do we finish it and pay it off?

32:13.640 --> 32:16.382
That's where the Invisible Man came...
That's where it worked.

32:16.476 --> 32:17.966
Fuck!

32:20.522 --> 32:22.012
We also painted Wee Man.

32:22.315 --> 32:26.058
April's house... April Margera paints
her house. Hand-does everything.

32:26.695 --> 32:28.777
Their basement
is painted like a dungeon.

32:29.114 --> 32:31.651
So, we had Seth paint Wee Man
into the wall.

32:32.534 --> 32:35.196
He does blend right in
and he disappears.

32:37.164 --> 32:42.204
We're in April Margera's house,
and this is the Invisible Wee.

32:51.011 --> 32:52.592
Jesus! Son of a...

32:56.391 --> 32:58.302
-Did you really not see that?
-Jesus!

32:58.393 --> 33:00.975
-Soon as I grabbed you...
-He scared the shit out of me!

33:01.062 --> 33:03.394
-Were the lights off?
-Who else can we get?

33:03.815 --> 33:04.850
Who else doesn't know?

33:14.743 --> 33:16.074
Oh, my God!

33:20.081 --> 33:21.491
Oh, my God!

33:26.087 --> 33:28.169
Hey, why do I get hit?

33:28.423 --> 33:31.290
That scared the shit out of me!
Oh, my God!

33:31.384 --> 33:32.920
You didn't see him at all?

33:33.261 --> 33:36.845
Now we're gonna send Dunn down
with a cattle prod to get Wee Man.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.137
You fucking dick!

33:48.276 --> 33:49.356
Fucking guy.

33:50.445 --> 33:53.858
That's what you get for scaring people,
you little...

33:57.619 --> 34:01.077
That lovely contraptio
kills rats with electricity.

34:02.916 --> 34:05.032
That's a metal rat.
It's hooked up to my nuts.

34:05.126 --> 34:07.367
I'm Steve-O, and this is the Rat Zapper.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.045
-All right then!
-Nailed it!

34:14.135 --> 34:17.753
Okay, I'm gonna just wind in here.

34:18.306 --> 34:20.888
-Yeah, "Oklahoma" is the safe word.
-Yeah, I'll turn it off then.

34:21.768 --> 34:23.975
-There we go.
-This is monster's balls.

34:26.106 --> 34:28.768
-Shit!
-Here you go.

34:28.858 --> 34:30.313
Monster's balls.

34:31.194 --> 34:32.353
Fuck!

34:36.199 --> 34:37.530
Oklahoma!

34:43.373 --> 34:45.614
-Man!
-See, you didn't tape them tight enough.

34:46.458 --> 34:47.869
He yelled, "Oklahoma."

34:48.545 --> 34:51.081
Ryan just stood there for a while
before he turned it off.

34:51.172 --> 34:53.333
-It was for his own good.
-We didn't know how to do it.

34:56.011 --> 34:59.174
-You think that felt good for the rat?
-Fuck!

34:59.764 --> 35:02.346
-You forgot to sponge him.
-Did it hurt?

35:04.686 --> 35:08.520
Thanks, guys. Oh, my God!
That is not fucking happening again.

35:09.065 --> 35:13.855
I'll... You touched your bloody nuts
with those fingers, so...

35:16.865 --> 35:18.275
What are these called again?

35:18.366 --> 35:20.448
-Belt sander skates.
-Belt sander skates.

35:20.952 --> 35:24.069
I'm Brandon Novak,
and this is Belt Sander Skates.

35:38.511 --> 35:40.342
Where doesn't it hurt?

35:42.891 --> 35:44.597
That's a wrap on this one,
right, Tremaine?

35:46.936 --> 35:49.097
I can't take any more of that.

35:50.607 --> 35:53.974
I guess both me and Knoxville
were old men in the first, and Bam.

35:54.069 --> 35:55.434
The three of us were old men
in the first one.

35:55.528 --> 35:58.486
In the second one, I was an old lady,
and Knoxville was an old man.

35:58.573 --> 36:00.655
In the third one
I wanted to be a fat, old lady.

36:01.076 --> 36:04.568
-You're big-boned.
-Yeah, I'm big-boned. That's all.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.074
I think that reads.

36:07.749 --> 36:12.243
-Fuck. Is that too much?
-The camel toe looks great.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.162
-Excuse me, sir?
-Yeah.

36:15.715 --> 36:19.128
A man just told me... He walked by me
and he told me I have a camel toe.

36:19.969 --> 36:22.335
-What happened?
-He said I had a camel toe.

36:22.430 --> 36:24.921
-Do I have something on my face?
-No.

36:26.434 --> 36:28.846
Do I have a camel toe on my head?

36:30.772 --> 36:33.104
-For me, no.
-Not for you?

36:33.483 --> 36:34.563
Something else you needed?

36:34.651 --> 36:36.858
Yeah, do I have
a giant pussy somewhere?

36:37.779 --> 36:39.235
I don't know.

36:40.615 --> 36:43.231
I didn't realize how insanely hot
it was gonna be,

36:43.326 --> 36:45.942
and it was, like, this much makeup.

36:46.287 --> 36:49.450
And it was like wearing five
sleeping bags in the dead of summer.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.953
After the first hour,
I just completely...

36:53.128 --> 36:55.710
It was as close as I've ever
come to like, a heatstroke.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.458
I was just gonna pass out and...

36:57.549 --> 37:00.461
At a certain point, I couldn't
even think, let alone be funny.

37:00.802 --> 37:02.838
Oh, my God! It's so hot.

37:03.138 --> 37:05.174
It is unbearably hot.

37:08.101 --> 37:09.887
He gave it hell, man. He tried.

37:10.270 --> 37:14.730
We shot a lot of...
What did we call her, "Kathy"?

37:16.735 --> 37:19.602
Hi, my name's Kathy,
and I have a camel toe.

37:19.696 --> 37:21.982
Come with me on a day of adventure.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.157
Shit! Oh, my God!

37:31.958 --> 37:33.573
I don't know how to start this thing.

37:36.004 --> 37:37.084
How do I turn?

37:38.173 --> 37:39.253
There!

37:41.843 --> 37:46.177
I'm such a slut
I like it in my butt

37:46.973 --> 37:50.431
I like sunshine all day long

38:02.363 --> 38:04.649
Help. Help.

38:05.742 --> 38:06.777
Help.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.907
I'm starting a modeling career,

38:08.995 --> 38:12.613
and I was wondering
what you think of my modeling photos.

38:13.041 --> 38:16.374
This is a photo of me. You like it?

38:17.170 --> 38:20.162
I have a new photograph
that I just shot of me.

38:21.049 --> 38:22.209
Wanna make love?

38:23.802 --> 38:26.384
No. Not to him, to me.

38:28.431 --> 38:31.298
Okay. I'll talk to you later.
I love you.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.898
Shit! Shit!

38:46.658 --> 38:47.898
You're my hero

38:48.117 --> 38:50.199
Spike, I don't think we go...
No one got that.

38:51.079 --> 38:52.990
Okay. Are you serious?

38:54.165 --> 38:55.325
Where do you think we're parked?

38:55.416 --> 38:57.532
Well, you gotta get the one right
in front of him. The $7 one.

38:57.627 --> 38:59.709
-That's the one we set up for.
-All right, dicks.

39:00.421 --> 39:01.456
Fuck.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.335
Johnny, did you get that one?

39:05.093 --> 39:08.460
-No, we did not.
-Fuck, man! What is he doing?

39:10.265 --> 39:13.473
Fucking A, man.
I can't believe this guy is a director.

39:14.269 --> 39:15.304
This is bullshit!

39:15.395 --> 39:17.351
Rick's going off on you right now,
Spike.

39:17.438 --> 39:19.349
I'm gonna butt-fuck Rick.

39:21.568 --> 39:24.526
Remember when we were sitting around
there, at that college,

39:24.612 --> 39:26.978
and you said that you could
kick somebody in the head?

39:27.073 --> 39:28.233
That's not how it works.

39:28.324 --> 39:30.690
-What happened?
-No. We were shooting slo-mo stuff,

39:30.785 --> 39:36.075
and Bam said that he wanted to do
a flying kick to the head.

39:36.332 --> 39:40.245
I'll come at this angle.
Like, if you're standing right there,

39:40.336 --> 39:43.624
I'll come right about here,
and I'll just be like...

39:43.798 --> 39:45.334
And then, right there.

39:45.925 --> 39:47.005
All right. Let's do that.

39:47.260 --> 39:50.423
And somehow I got elected
to be the kickee.

39:50.513 --> 39:51.844
Well, you're the only one
that can jump that high.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.137
No I got to be the kickee at first.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.716
How did this get pitched to you?

39:55.810 --> 39:57.391
I was just sitting
at the table over there,

39:57.478 --> 40:03.189
and Jeff said, "Hey, how about Bam
double-flying kicks you in the face?"

40:04.402 --> 40:05.608
-And here you are, on your mark.
-Yeah.

40:05.820 --> 40:08.357
Remember we caught you putting
styling gel in your hair?

40:08.448 --> 40:09.654
Fuck you...

40:11.618 --> 40:13.233
Fucking shit, dude!

40:14.495 --> 40:15.826
You okay?

40:17.165 --> 40:20.657
-Fuck! Dude, I'm fucking seeing stars.
-My fucking back!

40:21.044 --> 40:22.830
That's Bam Margera.

40:23.504 --> 40:25.040
You fucked up my hair, dude!

40:26.174 --> 40:28.506
And then the day went on, and Bam...

40:28.593 --> 40:30.549
He was talking shit,
saying you couldn't do it.

40:30.637 --> 40:32.252
No. You got it all wrong.

40:32.513 --> 40:34.344
He challenged Knoxville.

40:36.017 --> 40:39.601
-Didn't do it!
-Didn't do it!

40:39.938 --> 40:41.894
-So, you can't do it.
-Other people can do it.

40:41.981 --> 40:44.472
-Okay, can you do it? Dave?
-Somebody with talent can do it.

40:44.567 --> 40:46.649
-Dave can do it.
-I can't.

40:46.861 --> 40:48.817
-Dave can do it.
-Nobody can do it.

40:48.905 --> 40:51.271
-Me and Zupan can.
-Nobody can do it.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.357
-We're out.
-Can anybody do it?

40:53.451 --> 40:55.191
Dave, go try it. Dave, go try it.

40:55.495 --> 40:56.530
You're good to go?

40:56.621 --> 40:58.612
So, Bam, how many people
can't double-kick you in the face?

40:58.706 --> 41:01.493
No one here. There's 40 people here
and nobody can kick me in the face

41:01.584 --> 41:03.916
with two feet,
but everybody thinks it's so easy.

41:04.504 --> 41:06.870
-Actio
-Knoxville, Dunn.

41:12.887 --> 41:13.967
Dude, he jumped over you.

41:14.055 --> 41:17.138
-Oh, my God!
-Way to go Dave.

41:17.225 --> 41:21.138
-Oh, my God!
-You almost went over him.

41:22.855 --> 41:24.140
That was pretty good.

41:29.570 --> 41:31.151
This is the Enema Long Jump.

41:31.239 --> 41:33.696
Each contestant is gonna insert
two enemas

41:33.783 --> 41:37.241
and see who can jump the farthest
and shit the most.

41:38.913 --> 41:41.154
It doesn't matter
if you shit before you jump,

41:41.332 --> 41:44.119
after you jump,
or while you're airborne.

41:44.460 --> 41:46.325
It's just rad doing enemas.

41:48.423 --> 41:50.584
-Let's enema up.
-Let's get to it.

41:50.800 --> 41:51.915
How'd you put it in?

41:53.052 --> 41:56.044
-I'm just going...
-Why you choosing to be back there?

41:56.139 --> 41:58.300
-Yeah.
-Because he's the official.

41:58.933 --> 42:01.470
-Easy in and easy out?
-Bam, come here.

42:02.061 --> 42:03.471
-God!
-Yeah!

42:03.896 --> 42:04.931
Yours go in easy?

42:05.440 --> 42:07.977
I like pooing,
but I like pooing with these better.

42:08.276 --> 42:10.107
If you do them every day for no reason,

42:10.236 --> 42:12.852
not while doing a movie,
you're a weirdo.

42:12.947 --> 42:14.778
God, I want to shit!

42:15.533 --> 42:16.613
Here.

42:28.796 --> 42:30.878
8'11".

42:34.135 --> 42:36.217
-Go.
-You can win this!

42:50.443 --> 42:51.649
Measure it.

42:52.904 --> 42:54.314
I think you're winning.

42:54.822 --> 42:57.655
I'll hold your legs up
while he squirts it in.

42:59.952 --> 43:01.943
Really get it in there.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.956
All right, you're good.

43:10.171 --> 43:12.207
-Get back over there.
-Yeah.

43:13.091 --> 43:15.173
Steve-O, come on, win this!

43:20.848 --> 43:24.261
-Right on...
-Right in the fucking...

43:24.477 --> 43:26.183
Here he goes!

43:32.235 --> 43:34.601
Dude! Do you see that

43:34.695 --> 43:36.811
-brown shit in there?
-You're walking on it.

43:37.365 --> 43:39.026
-Did I win?
-Yeah.

43:39.242 --> 43:40.698
-The guy is so stressed!
-What do you got?

43:40.785 --> 43:42.400
-11'6".
-11'6".

43:42.537 --> 43:44.573
-Dave, you gotta get...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:54.507 --> 43:56.714
-Fucking A. Wait...
-No, no, no, no.

43:56.801 --> 43:59.543
That's where Steve-O already landed.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.261
Oh, my God, dude!

44:06.936 --> 44:09.393
That was it. 12'4".

44:09.897 --> 44:11.262
Dave won.

44:11.732 --> 44:14.098
-I would say we're all winners here.
-Hold on, Rick, here.

44:15.820 --> 44:16.980
Dude!

44:18.072 --> 44:19.312
Oh, my God!

44:20.825 --> 44:22.781
It was quite a battle,
but we have a winner.

44:23.202 --> 44:25.739
With a jump of 12'4", Dave England.

44:29.709 --> 44:30.789
Yes!

44:31.085 --> 44:33.417
You know when I learned...
I decided to really

44:33.796 --> 44:36.959
learn to wipe myself was when
my mom wasn't home one day

44:37.049 --> 44:39.165
and my dad had to wipe my butt.

44:39.260 --> 44:42.423
And I did not feel comfortable with it.

44:44.056 --> 44:46.672
I didn't like that dude wiping my butt.

44:46.767 --> 44:48.678
And he was kind of rough.

44:52.190 --> 44:55.728
Yeah. Fuck, yeah.
This is Treadmill Shit Show.

45:03.117 --> 45:04.448
You made it!

45:07.872 --> 45:10.079
Yeah, whatever happened
to the treadmills?

45:10.166 --> 45:12.373
We got all kinds of awesome stuff.

45:12.460 --> 45:15.042
We had it where we had
all the treadmills lined up

45:15.129 --> 45:17.415
facing each other, and we all,
at the same time, jumped in,

45:17.506 --> 45:19.292
and Steve-O hit me right in the face.

45:24.805 --> 45:26.716
-You all right?
-Was it Steve-O?

45:26.807 --> 45:29.093
Dave got kicked right
in his fucking face.

45:29.185 --> 45:30.550
He deserves it.

45:30.645 --> 45:32.727
-Everybody deserves everything.
-Yeah.

45:32.813 --> 45:34.519
You deserve this.

45:50.665 --> 45:52.621
-Fuck!
-Tail bone!

46:00.007 --> 46:01.872
-I love it.
-You were rad.

46:02.343 --> 46:03.879
I love watching you skate.

46:14.981 --> 46:18.098
I'm here with TV's Ryan Dunn,
and today's his lucky day

46:18.192 --> 46:19.773
'cause this is Treadmill D-Style.

46:19.860 --> 46:21.225
Rehoboth Beach!

46:34.875 --> 46:37.617
His face almost stuck
in Wee Man's bottom.

46:38.546 --> 46:41.003
It got dark fast.

46:43.551 --> 46:46.293
Human Cheetah is a bit
where someone gets shot up

46:46.387 --> 46:48.844
with paintballs all over the body.

46:50.224 --> 46:53.887
The outcome is that
the bruises from the paintballs

46:53.978 --> 46:55.559
leaves spots everywhere

46:56.022 --> 46:57.683
and you're supposed to
look like a cheetah.

46:59.317 --> 47:02.229
Steve-O has a heart,
Pontius has a heart,

47:02.320 --> 47:03.776
they didn't want to shoot me.

47:03.863 --> 47:05.899
But they actually fucked my bit up,

47:06.157 --> 47:08.398
because Dave, he doesn't give a shit,

47:08.826 --> 47:11.613
and he fully shot me all on this side,

47:12.038 --> 47:14.780
and this was Steve-O and Chris' side,

47:14.874 --> 47:18.583
and I had, like, one or two over here,
and this side was just covered.

47:19.003 --> 47:22.336
And the paintballs were so powerful,
I got cut up

47:22.798 --> 47:25.710
on all the spots that I got hit on.

47:26.761 --> 47:30.299
I'm Wee Man, and this is The Cheetah.

47:31.474 --> 47:34.932
Ready, aim, fire!

47:42.860 --> 47:44.145
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

47:44.945 --> 47:47.357
-Fucking hell.
-I'm hit and fucking bleeding.

47:47.448 --> 47:50.064
-I nailed him there.
-God damn, you got rocked!

47:50.284 --> 47:53.776
-How long does it take to bruise up?
-I'm already bruising.

47:53.871 --> 47:56.453
They're hurting right now, dude.
It hurts!

47:57.583 --> 48:00.620
-Which one hurts the most?
-Right here.

48:02.088 --> 48:05.455
-You're right, that looks painful.
-That, and then right here.

48:06.967 --> 48:08.332
Let me see.

48:09.303 --> 48:10.793
No! Inside!

48:11.639 --> 48:13.630
That's gonna hurt so bad when you wipe.

48:13.891 --> 48:15.631
-I know.
-Oh, my God!

48:15.726 --> 48:17.717
Don't get poo -poo in it!

48:18.312 --> 48:22.976
Half my body is still bruised up
over here from The Cheetah

48:23.275 --> 48:25.641
that happened, like, nine months ago.

48:25.820 --> 48:27.481
And this side has nothing.

48:27.822 --> 48:28.982
This was all my bros,

48:29.365 --> 48:31.230
and this is all the dudes that hate me.

48:33.536 --> 48:37.449
-I'm not whipping your dick out.
-All right, well, pull the fat up.

48:37.540 --> 48:39.121
Didn't get up.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.991
-I'm at it.
-You're at it?

48:42.503 --> 48:44.414
All right,
just, please, pull the zipper down.

48:44.505 --> 48:45.836
-The zipper's down.
-No, it ain't.

48:45.923 --> 48:47.379
What are you guys doing?

48:47.466 --> 48:49.002
It's so warm!

48:50.010 --> 48:53.719
-Is that your dick?
-Just try to hurry, 'cause I'm gonna piss.

48:53.848 --> 48:54.883
You almost had it.

48:54.974 --> 48:57.807
Here, here.
I gotta get in there bareback.

48:59.353 --> 49:00.843
It's getting weirder and weirder.

49:01.397 --> 49:02.603
This is awkward.

49:03.023 --> 49:04.263
Grab the boxers.

49:04.525 --> 49:05.981
Pull 'em down, man!

49:06.068 --> 49:08.275
God! It's like a river.

49:12.366 --> 49:13.776
Bros.

49:16.370 --> 49:19.077
-Feel better?
-No, because of the balls!

49:20.374 --> 49:22.080
Yeah. Yeah!

49:24.628 --> 49:26.368
See? That's what I was talking about.
It was blocking it.

49:29.717 --> 49:31.127
Do an intro, Winter Fat Fucks.

49:32.052 --> 49:34.008
This is Winter Fat Fucks.

49:35.139 --> 49:37.551
All right, now I'm ready to rock.

49:52.323 --> 49:54.905
Hit the Winter Fat Fucks.

49:55.659 --> 49:56.899
Fuck!

50:07.922 --> 50:12.040
-Hey, grandma.
-Eat shit, fat fuck.

50:20.267 --> 50:21.973
It's the slow shit I hate.

50:35.032 --> 50:37.114
-Oh, my God!
-Yeah!

50:40.287 --> 50:41.618
I did it!

50:42.289 --> 50:43.870
So good!

50:45.709 --> 50:47.415
This is a woodpecker,

50:47.795 --> 50:51.287
and this is a Wood Pecker.

50:51.715 --> 50:53.455
What's gonna happen next?

50:54.927 --> 50:59.216
By the way, this is Dr. Jesse Merlin,
our resident bird expert.

50:59.306 --> 51:01.968
Can I place the woodpecker
on the limb now?

51:02.059 --> 51:03.799
If you would, please.

51:03.978 --> 51:05.218
This is a breakthrough.

51:05.312 --> 51:07.803
Thousands of years of medical science
have led to this beautiful moment.

51:07.898 --> 51:10.139
Here, Woody. Here, Woody.

51:10.651 --> 51:12.391
-Have led to me losing my dignity.
-Woody. Woody.

51:12.486 --> 51:14.647
-Here you go, look. Woody.
-Believe me.

51:15.656 --> 51:18.989
He's into me right now.
My day's gonna go terribly wrong.

51:19.118 --> 51:21.655
-This is where the magic happens.
-Don't move.

51:22.663 --> 51:23.948
Boy!

51:26.000 --> 51:27.331
I don't envy you.

51:31.463 --> 51:32.669
It's dented.

51:33.507 --> 51:34.622
Get in there.

51:39.513 --> 51:41.253
We have a puncture.

51:50.482 --> 51:52.689
Someone give me a stick
to bite on or something.

51:52.985 --> 51:54.191
I don't wanna scare him.

51:59.033 --> 52:00.523
Don't move 'cause he's standing on you.

52:00.618 --> 52:02.449
It's hard to hold my ground right now.

52:02.536 --> 52:05.699
No you can't move
because he's fully on your schlong.

52:05.789 --> 52:07.495
I'm gonna be careful...

52:13.797 --> 52:15.833
That was flesh!

52:22.014 --> 52:25.381
He's chewing on my pee hole.
Okay. One second, one second.

52:26.060 --> 52:29.052
Chewing on my pee hole.
Sorry, man, that freaked me out.

52:29.897 --> 52:31.228
That's not what I expected.

52:38.906 --> 52:40.066
Oh, God, it stinks.

52:42.701 --> 52:43.907
You gotta see this.

52:50.834 --> 52:53.416
-Cute little butthole.
-Look how disgusting that is.

52:53.712 --> 52:55.748
Like, what if you had to do that?

52:55.923 --> 52:57.834
It's like a stunt.

52:59.718 --> 53:01.254
Let's just do it. Let's go do it.

53:01.929 --> 53:03.760
That's a formidable scent.

53:04.098 --> 53:07.590
-Is that from the smell of that?
-Dude, the smell is really...

53:08.227 --> 53:10.934
If I did a shit,
it still wouldn't be good as this.

53:11.605 --> 53:13.220
Fucking disgusting.

53:13.774 --> 53:15.514
I can't be there.

53:15.734 --> 53:19.022
Sounds like that bull
is just dying to shoot.

53:19.613 --> 53:21.023
He's making lots of noise,

53:21.115 --> 53:24.107
and I know that's not doing one thing
for Wee Man's confidence.

53:24.451 --> 53:26.032
He looks pretty nervous, too.

53:26.120 --> 53:28.202
It's fucking nerve-racking, man!

53:28.539 --> 53:30.370
When that bull sees you
and comes at you,

53:30.749 --> 53:33.286
it's no joke.

53:34.545 --> 53:37.787
I'm Wee Man, and this is the Yoga Ball.

53:44.763 --> 53:46.799
Get away from the fence.

53:52.146 --> 53:54.762
-He survived.
-Wee Man! Wee Man!

53:55.816 --> 53:57.397
Get up here!

53:58.277 --> 54:00.108
Oh, my God!

54:00.487 --> 54:02.603
That's so scary!

54:06.493 --> 54:09.735
-That was one big son of a bitch, dude.
-I had no idea.

54:09.830 --> 54:12.162
He came out, dude, I was like...

54:12.416 --> 54:13.451
Fuck!

54:13.667 --> 54:15.828
-He looked much shorter in the gate.
-Yeah.

54:16.003 --> 54:18.164
He looked way shorter in the gate.

54:18.464 --> 54:19.920
-Hey, man, awesome, dude.
-Thank you.

54:20.007 --> 54:23.090
-Good God! You're my man.
-Thank you, man.

54:23.177 --> 54:24.838
You've had some good moments
in this arena, man.

54:24.970 --> 54:26.801
-Yeah. Thanks, Gary.
-Where is that bull now?

54:30.184 --> 54:32.516
-Wee Man!
-Wee Man! All right!

54:36.148 --> 54:38.685
I'm the devil, and it's time to burn.

54:44.698 --> 54:48.031
The Flaming Gauntlet is definitely
my most macho bit,

54:48.368 --> 54:50.780
because I knew
that I was gonna get burned.

54:51.497 --> 54:52.953
What's the plan here, O?

54:53.040 --> 54:55.156
Well, I come along this beam,

54:56.043 --> 54:58.034
these balls are on fire,

54:59.463 --> 55:03.047
and they're swinging,
and they knock me into the fire.

55:05.469 --> 55:08.381
The guy who ran the warehouse
where we shot the Flaming Gauntlet

55:08.680 --> 55:12.548
was concerned that the heat
from burning the coals

55:13.393 --> 55:15.554
was gonna crack his cement.

55:15.687 --> 55:17.723
So, in order to protect his cement,

55:18.148 --> 55:21.390
he laid down these steel sheets.

55:29.576 --> 55:31.407
Yeah, I noticed that.

55:32.246 --> 55:35.204
-Why did they put it on a frying pan?
-I don't know.

55:41.880 --> 55:44.587
Really walking the line
between horror and humor.

55:46.218 --> 55:47.549
This is a rough one, man.

55:47.719 --> 55:49.004
Like, I'm a thrower,

55:49.096 --> 55:53.089
and if I hit him with one of the balls,
he's going into the pit.

55:53.684 --> 55:54.844
That's gnarly.

55:57.437 --> 55:59.769
Holy shit! My ball's crazy, man!

56:08.699 --> 56:11.782
I'm Steve-O,
and this is the Flaming Gauntlet.

56:49.072 --> 56:51.484
Fuck! Fuck!

56:52.284 --> 56:53.820
It's still on you, man.

56:58.332 --> 57:01.324
-God damn it.
-Is it hot?

57:01.460 --> 57:03.667
Yeah, man, it's burned.

57:03.754 --> 57:05.619
Yeah!

57:06.173 --> 57:07.333
Is your skin burnt or is it just...

57:07.466 --> 57:09.752
-Yeah, look at that, right there.
-Yeah.

57:09.843 --> 57:11.674
-Shit.
-It's gonna get...

57:11.803 --> 57:14.510
-Yeah, it's really hot.
-You're burned, man.

57:14.598 --> 57:16.839
Yeah, it's really hot.

57:16.934 --> 57:18.845
-That's the thing about fire.
-I know.

57:18.936 --> 57:19.971
It's hot.

57:20.270 --> 57:23.762
I got burned all up the side of my body.

57:23.857 --> 57:25.939
I had to go to a burn unit.

57:28.820 --> 57:31.106
Shit!

57:31.198 --> 57:32.608
Call the medic.

57:34.159 --> 57:35.194
Dude, grab some towels.

57:35.369 --> 57:36.779
What's your pain level at?

57:36.870 --> 57:40.704
A normal person
would probably ask for a painkiller.

57:42.876 --> 57:45.993
Well, you got your card revoked.

57:48.674 --> 57:49.880
If you want the job done...

57:50.008 --> 57:52.670
-Just rub it in a little more.
-... if you want respect...

57:52.886 --> 57:53.835
So gay.

57:53.957 --> 57:56.219
I don't know any gay dudes that do this.

57:57.516 --> 57:58.881
This will plug you up.

58:00.686 --> 58:03.553
That's a man
that has nothing left to lose.

58:05.065 --> 58:09.559
That's Brandon Novak,
and this is the Dildo Bazooka.

58:10.070 --> 58:13.233
Jackass 3D: Full Penetration.

58:15.909 --> 58:18.241
Oh, God. Jesus.

58:25.711 --> 58:27.702
-All right. Ready?
-Yeah, yeah.

58:29.673 --> 58:34.212
I had a tripod brought in,
so I can get a guaranteed hit.

58:37.097 --> 58:38.177
Wait.

58:38.265 --> 58:39.254
Here we go.

58:53.572 --> 58:54.732
Can I see where it hit?

58:58.076 --> 58:59.532
Oh, God!

58:59.619 --> 59:01.575
-The skid mark.
-Laugh it up, guys.

59:01.705 --> 59:04.117
Oh, my God!

59:05.792 --> 59:08.374
-It's shaped like a dong.
-Dude.

59:08.462 --> 59:12.046
And there's a dong pointing to it.

59:12.132 --> 59:14.965
I finally made it, Mom.

59:16.803 --> 59:20.091
This is the Flying Nut High Five.

59:25.145 --> 59:26.976
I fucking slipped!

59:29.066 --> 59:30.397
Oh, my God!

59:30.484 --> 59:33.647
Flying Nut High Five
is the attempt to jump up in the air

59:33.779 --> 59:34.894
running at another dude,

59:34.988 --> 59:37.900
spread your legs,
and then knock your nuts together.

59:37.991 --> 59:40.323
But it never worked.

59:40.410 --> 59:42.617
Surprisingly difficult.

59:43.163 --> 59:45.996
Bam's Liberace diamond -covered soles,

59:46.124 --> 59:48.160
it's the worst thing ever.

59:51.630 --> 59:54.588
-Did I get sabotaged or am I just...
-No they're both... Look at this.

59:54.841 --> 59:56.502
You just don't know how to sit right.

59:59.638 --> 01:00:01.674
It's this chair, man.

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:03.426
Fucking chair.

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:06.429
It's, like, the most flimsy
fucking chair I've ever met.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.930
Shit!

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:10.478
Here we go again.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.523
This is the Flying Nut High Five.

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.277
Why don't you guys take your shoes off?

01:00:26.373 --> 01:00:29.706
Why don't you shut the fuck up?

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:34.043
We started off on the same chairs!

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:37.464
Look at yours, it's just crumbling.

01:00:46.059 --> 01:00:48.300
-It's ruined.
-Fuck!

01:00:48.395 --> 01:00:50.886
No...

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:02.064
Come on, man. Look at this.
We got a parachute, two of us on a bike,

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:03.569
and a massive ramp.

01:01:03.702 --> 01:01:06.159
And this bike was bought last night
on the Internet. Am I correct?

01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:08.578
Yeah. I think he went and picked it up
about midnight.

01:01:08.874 --> 01:01:10.580
Seriously, this was bought at midnight,

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:12.665
-found online.
-Yeah.

01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:16.169
So, explain to me what this scene is.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:22.335
All right. We got Andy Bell
and Dave England riding a motorcycle

01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:25.171
and hitting that ramp going really fast.

01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:28.348
And Dave England's on the back of it
with a parachute,

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:30.847
and they're gonna ditch the motorcycle
in the air,

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:33.599
Dave England's
parachute's gonna go up,

01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:37.520
it's probably not gonna deploy,
and he's gonna hit very hard.

01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:39.522
-In the water?
-Yeah.

01:01:39.613 --> 01:01:41.353
Hopefully.

01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:42.858
I'm gonna laugh my head off.

01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:47.776
I'm here with Andy Bell,
and this is the Moto Base Jump.

01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:49.577
Yeah.

01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:56.580
Here we go. Here we go.

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:58.294
Kids, don't try this at home.

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:17.389
-He almost did a full roll.
-Look at it.

01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:20.897
That, dude, when they hit the ramp,
they almost buckled.

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:22.477
Holy shit.

01:02:24.324 --> 01:02:27.816
This game is called
God's Special Purpose for Me is Over.

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:33.914
-It knocked the wind out of me so bad.
-It knocked the wind out of me, too.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.083
I just saw my entry, I'm like, "Oh, no."

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:39.661
God, it gave me a nutter.

01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:42.918
Are you gonna try it again, ladies?

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:44.920
Over and over till we get it right.

01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:46.592
With you on the back, Eddie.

01:02:48.682 --> 01:02:52.925
Fat-Fat is hungry for some chocolate,
so now I'm gonna feed him.

01:02:58.358 --> 01:02:59.848
I'm Wee Bam.

01:02:59.985 --> 01:03:01.941
This is the Ballway.

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:03.768
Shit's gonna get muffed up.

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:14.537
That's the cutest thing I ever saw.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:20.544
The look on his face was so happy,
like a big, perverted Labrador.

01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:29.128
Oh, shit.

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:37.476
Yeah!

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:50.072
Fuck.

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:57.865
Was that the corner?

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:01.827
-Fuck.
-Dave.

01:04:03.256 --> 01:04:04.336
That's not good.

01:04:04.424 --> 01:04:06.380
That was the corner, right?

01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:09.547
Yeah, he's gonna have to see somebody.

01:04:09.763 --> 01:04:12.425
-Let's help him over here.
-Hit my head on the fucking wall, dude.

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:13.846
-Yeah.
-Grab his arm,

01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:15.173
so he doesn't trip and fall.

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:20.057
Party.

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:31.110
-What are you guys doing?
-Wow.

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:39.615
This is the Electric Limbo.

01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:47.296
He couldn't let go.

01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:50.458
We shot a lot with electricity.

01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:53.970
Like, we built a limbo bar
that was totally charged.

01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:55.964
The bar was electric.

01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:57.139
-Like that.
-It's great.

01:04:57.268 --> 01:04:58.383
No off to the side shit.

01:04:58.478 --> 01:05:01.311
-Oh, man, it's tough.
-I'm not sure about your technique.

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:04.977
You're leaning forward.
You should be going backwards.

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:06.646
Go, go, go, go.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.821
Fudge!

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:14.987
Yeah, Wee.

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:19.996
Electricity's a wild beast.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.081
And it's an unpredictable beast.

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.166
Come on, Dave.

01:05:29.676 --> 01:05:32.088
Fucking shit!

01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:33.258
Fuck!

01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:36.179
And it sucks. Electricity fucking sucks.

01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:39.595
Okay, whoever licks the ladder
is the champ.

01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:41.426
Go, Steve-O.

01:05:46.526 --> 01:05:48.016
Let's party!

01:05:50.196 --> 01:05:51.936
-You got it.
-Get on your knees.

01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:54.192
-All right.
-Damn!

01:05:54.284 --> 01:05:56.525
-No
-Get your tongue way out.

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:57.859
There's no danger. Yeah.

01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.115
Yeah, just put it in.

01:06:00.206 --> 01:06:02.538
-You got it.
-You've licked worse things.

01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:05.033
-It's a party.
-There it is.

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:06.459
-You got it.
-Do it.

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:07.831
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:06:12.886 --> 01:06:14.501
The champ!

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:23.059
Whenever the bit involves
Pontius' penis in a costume,

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:27.139
you don't wanna be
in the peanut gallery.

01:06:27.233 --> 01:06:32.227
Hey, Chris, we don't need to see
your outfit from this side.

01:06:32.363 --> 01:06:34.069
You don't need to. It's a bonus.

01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:36.986
What most people don't know is,

01:06:37.076 --> 01:06:38.816
we did a lot of penis-related stunts

01:06:38.912 --> 01:06:42.075
'cause there's so many funny ideas
to do with the penis

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:43.993
that have been yet unexplored.

01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:51.042
And Chris is insanely particular
about putting a costume on his penis,

01:06:51.382 --> 01:06:56.046
and it took us about
six hours just to get it dressed.

01:06:56.429 --> 01:06:59.592
Since we made it tighter,
this is like one thing,

01:06:59.724 --> 01:07:01.339
so it doesn't hang like it did.

01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:04.926
But wait. I think if you keep jamming it
in there, it will bend it down.

01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:07.349
Keep stuffing it in there.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.102
That's what I was trying to say.
I need some assistance.

01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:14.607
Also, a lesser-known fact is
they scheduled them one after another.

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:17.947
First, it's like,
"Put your penis in the rat trap."

01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:19.941
He's looking at it.

01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:27.119
And then,

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:31.707
the numerous helicopter tugs.

01:07:32.632 --> 01:07:34.213
Swing around with it.

01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:38.047
I like, in particular,

01:07:38.137 --> 01:07:40.469
when it's the clear box with the cat,

01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:43.931
and he had it dressed up like a cat toy
with catnip all over it.

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:46.972
I guess the idea was
he'd get it scratched up real bad.

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.230
Dude, that...

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:59.405
Apparently, catnip
is an aphrodisiac, too,

01:07:59.492 --> 01:08:04.657
because he was really loving
on that mousy.

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:09.832
We were just hoping that mousy
didn't grow in size and stature.

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:11.910
And Pontius was making
all kinds of crazy faces

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:14.417
to keep that from happening.

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:16.667
He's a powerful little bastard.

01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:21.676
And it's really awkward.
The cat even, I think, felt awkward.

01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:24.843
What's your definition of uncomfortable,

01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:27.179
stud?

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:52.457
Oh, God!

01:08:54.546 --> 01:08:55.877
Hi, Priya.

01:08:57.175 --> 01:08:58.381
Man, you're jumpy.

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:02.381
So, Priya Swaminathan,
who is head of development

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:04.462
for our production company,

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:07.799
is super jumpy.
She gets scared so easy.

01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:13.560
So, we've rigged a triple train horn

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.060
in her office.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:19.231
She's gonna flip out.

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:21.313
She's gonna... All I've gotta do
is hit this little button,

01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:24.569
which they won't let me hold yet.

01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:29.362
'Cause I'll fuck it up.

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:44.676
Oh, my God!

01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:46.254
I'm fucking quitting!

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:47.846
What happened?

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:50.390
Fuck.

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:54.179
Oh, my God!

01:09:54.273 --> 01:09:56.104
-Horrible.
-Oh, my God.

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.899
You guys are lucky
that I didn't pee my pants.

01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:01.694
I try to not let that happen.

01:10:08.913 --> 01:10:10.699
That's so fucking loud.

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:13.873
Oh, my God. That scared me.

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.878
Knoxville always just pranks everybody
and always gets away with it

01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:22.628
'cause it's very difficult to get him.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.216
But we got him.

01:10:24.595 --> 01:10:25.960
We were showing
a cast and crew screening,

01:10:26.097 --> 01:10:28.383
and then they're like,
"Hey, come down to the front

01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:30.715
"and say something to everyone."

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:33.552
I was actually getting choked up
talking to everybody,

01:10:33.646 --> 01:10:36.763
and then Kimmel runs down there
and says, "Shut up."

01:10:46.826 --> 01:10:47.986
Enjoy.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:57.082
Knoxville has prescription lotion,
and that's all he uses.

01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.080
And I got it.

01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:01.663
But I got something else.

01:11:01.799 --> 01:11:02.834
Horse cum.

01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:07.843
From a horse, idiot.

01:11:08.806 --> 01:11:10.922
Dude, did you get it directly
from the horse?

01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:12.678
I don't know.

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.425
Pour some of that out.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.761
Yeah, pour some out.

01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:19.188
It reeks. That's fucking...

01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:21.690
All right, that's good, that's good.

01:11:21.819 --> 01:11:23.684
That is fucking disgusting, dude.

01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:28.857
-Did you pour some out?
-Yeah.

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:32.193
-Squeeze it.
-Squeeze the ball. Squeeze it first,

01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:33.786
-and then stick it in.
-I don't know.

01:11:33.873 --> 01:11:35.363
-You're making a cum bubble.
-Look at the cum.

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:38.291
-I don't know. I'm stupid.
-Dude, cum bubble?

01:11:38.377 --> 01:11:40.117
Dude.

01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:41.703
What are you doing?

01:11:41.839 --> 01:11:43.625
What are you doing with your life?

01:11:43.716 --> 01:11:45.047
Dude, I'm gonna throw up.

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:46.795
-Here, switch.
-Here, come on. Just...

01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:48.626
Come on. Put the fucking thing
in the fucking thing.

01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:50.382
-I'll do that part.
-Just pour it in.

01:11:50.515 --> 01:11:51.800
Yeah, just pour it in.

01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:53.722
Just pour it in. Make it a little...
Let me see this.

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:55.391
Look at it. It's sticky.

01:11:57.814 --> 01:11:59.054
Gross.

01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:03.724
Look at it.

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:06.022
It's stringy.

01:12:11.577 --> 01:12:12.817
Watch.

01:12:19.085 --> 01:12:20.325
Put it back in his car.

01:12:20.419 --> 01:12:22.751
Yeah, I'm gonna put it back
in his car now.

01:12:24.215 --> 01:12:26.831
That's why it's so stringy!

01:12:29.762 --> 01:12:32.174
It's been that way for months.

01:12:32.265 --> 01:12:33.425
Dude.

01:12:43.442 --> 01:12:44.557
I'm sweating.

01:12:51.284 --> 01:12:52.774
They got me.

01:12:52.952 --> 01:12:56.115
I was rubbing horse cum on my face
for weeks.

01:12:56.581 --> 01:12:59.948
And I knew one day, the consistency
of my sunscreen had changed.

01:13:00.084 --> 01:13:02.200
It got super stringy.

01:13:02.295 --> 01:13:06.379
Super stringy! And I thought
it had just got so hot in the car.

01:13:06.465 --> 01:13:10.879
But no, it wasn't because of the heat.
It was horse cum.

01:13:12.763 --> 01:13:15.721
Before we started filming, I had a dream

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:17.719
where we were on the set,

01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:22.895
and we were drawing a dart board
on my face with markers.

01:13:22.982 --> 01:13:24.563
And then I woke up from the dream,
and I was like,

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:26.481
"We've gotta throw darts at my face."

01:13:26.777 --> 01:13:29.644
Knoxville and Tremaine
said that they liked the idea

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:34.649
only if somebody shot darts
from their asshole through a blowgun.

01:13:35.661 --> 01:13:39.995
I'm Steve-O, and this is Fart Darts.

01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:04.687
That's good.

01:14:21.874 --> 01:14:23.364
That was in there.

01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:25.287
-It's bleeding.
-It's bleeding.

01:14:25.378 --> 01:14:27.790
God! You are awesome.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.620
-Look how deep that went in.
-Show the camera.

01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:32.548
-Look how fucking deep that went.
-Look at... Fucking... Look!

01:14:32.677 --> 01:14:33.883
Good job, Will.

01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:38.380
Knoxville's incredible nut shots,
that occupied some time.

01:14:38.557 --> 01:14:41.048
I figure, what, we filmed eight months?

01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:45.512
Two of them were incredible nut shots.

01:14:45.898 --> 01:14:47.559
How many basketballs
did we go through for this?

01:14:48.025 --> 01:14:50.812
Probably about 200.

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:54.316
Because first you wanted
the women's basketball

01:14:54.407 --> 01:14:55.817
'cause you thought
that was the perfect one.

01:14:55.908 --> 01:14:57.648
Well, for different shots,
it's different.

01:14:57.743 --> 01:15:00.405
If you gotta throw it a great distance,
shoOting with the women's basketball,

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:03.738
-you can throw farther.
-You got it down to a science.

01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:06.245
But it's true. When we first started
doing it, we would just get

01:15:06.585 --> 01:15:09.327
a bunch of different basketballs,
and throw them.

01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:12.255
But I realized that you need all the...

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:14.502
Whatever thing you do,
you need all the basketballs

01:15:14.593 --> 01:15:17.505
the same size and the same pressure

01:15:17.596 --> 01:15:20.338
because it's hard enough hitting
someone from a great distance

01:15:20.433 --> 01:15:23.766
Or bouncing it. So, we trjed to remove
all the varjables.

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:28.017
And it would take anywhere
from an hour to 13

01:15:28.107 --> 01:15:30.519
to just get one shot.

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:41.032
Yes!

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:42.590
Yeah!

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:37.729
Yeah!

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:18.023
Fuck that fucking shit.

01:18:24.617 --> 01:18:25.777
Fuck that.

01:18:27.286 --> 01:18:29.197
If you're gonna be dumb,
you gotta be tough.

01:18:29.288 --> 01:18:30.573
Yeah, I do.

01:19:17.294 --> 01:19:18.329
Let go.

01:19:51.662 --> 01:19:52.697
Fuck!

01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:35.364
Oh, my goodness!

01:20:35.456 --> 01:20:36.662
Who put that there?

01:20:36.915 --> 01:20:40.032
It's Spanish Street Bike Tommy.

01:20:40.127 --> 01:20:43.244
Street Bike Tommy and Steve-O
had a baby.

01:20:44.465 --> 01:20:47.548
Steve-O and Street Bike Tommy
had this baby right here.

01:20:47.634 --> 01:20:48.669
He's cute.

01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:57.262
I got shit all over my balls.

01:20:57.603 --> 01:21:01.312
My balls are sitting in
a little bowl of poo water.

01:21:04.151 --> 01:21:05.982
Oh, God. I'm embarrassed.

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:35.717
All right, this is piss from
a female donkey in heat.

01:21:44.358 --> 01:21:46.098
Why did you drink that?

01:21:46.193 --> 01:21:47.524
Because I'm horny.

01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:50.895
God!

01:21:54.368 --> 01:21:57.952
I don't think
you're getting the donkey hot, Steve-O.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.871
Dude, I don't even know
what to complain about anymore.

01:22:05.546 --> 01:22:08.959
My hand, my fucking chipped shoulder,

01:22:09.049 --> 01:22:12.257
my broken ribs, my hurt-ass knee,
which hurts like hell,

01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:14.630
and now a twisted fucking ankle.

01:22:14.721 --> 01:22:16.803
I don't know
what to complain about anymore.

01:22:16.890 --> 01:22:18.005
That sucked.

01:22:26.608 --> 01:22:27.723
Wait, you know what I forgot to do?

01:22:27.901 --> 01:22:30.734
When we got into London,
we actually, from the airport,

01:22:30.821 --> 01:22:34.234
we passed a town called Bicester.

01:22:35.325 --> 01:22:37.156
Get your tongue out of my mouth!

01:22:40.873 --> 01:22:42.738
It's so rough. It's like a cat's tongue.

01:22:48.338 --> 01:22:52.752
We'll have justice on three, two, one!

01:22:55.888 --> 01:22:57.753
Oh, my God!

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:04.806
Oh, God. Do not throw hard.

01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:14.861
-That hurt!
-Let's see that run back.

01:23:14.948 --> 01:23:16.813
That's what I was talking about.

01:23:26.126 --> 01:23:27.707
Clear!

01:23:36.386 --> 01:23:38.126
You're a fucking asshole.
