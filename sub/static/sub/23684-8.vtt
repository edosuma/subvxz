WEBVTT

00:03.206 --> 00:04.655
- Previously on
"Hit the Floor"...

00:04.724 --> 00:06.241
- I never thought
there'd come a time

00:06.310 --> 00:08.482
that I'd feel something again,
but I did.

00:08.551 --> 00:10.103
With you.

00:10.172 --> 00:12.724
- I'd rather be poor with you
than rich with anyone else.

00:14.310 --> 00:16.827
- You're so secretive.
I don't blame you.

00:16.896 --> 00:18.482
I just can't love you.

00:18.551 --> 00:21.275
- When I'm done,
there won't be a Devils left.

00:21.344 --> 00:23.551
- The Devils are going
to the Finals!

00:23.620 --> 00:25.413
- The Devils have
no safety net.

00:25.482 --> 00:29.034
No reprieve.
It's title or game over.

00:29.103 --> 00:30.758
- I had this thing
that needed to happen.

00:30.827 --> 00:32.620
Just ten points in a game.

00:32.689 --> 00:35.206
- Derek cheated
while you were on the court.

00:35.275 --> 00:36.931
The Devils are going down.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.827
Whose side will you be on
when you do?

00:38.896 --> 00:40.586
- Pastor Curtis, please!
- Pastor Curtis, over here.

00:40.655 --> 00:43.793
- Keep the pastor.
He's going straight to hell...

00:43.862 --> 00:45.793
and so are you.

01:08.655 --> 01:10.827
- Ah!

01:10.896 --> 01:13.137
- Ugh!

01:17.965 --> 01:19.620
- Hey, stop.
Stop.

01:19.689 --> 01:21.896
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop--
- You tried to stop it once

01:21.965 --> 01:23.275
and it didn't work.

01:23.344 --> 01:24.586
- It's my turn.
- Let her stop it, Derek.

01:24.655 --> 01:28.517
- I'm doing this for her,
not you.

01:28.586 --> 01:30.965
I protected you once
but that's over.

01:31.034 --> 01:33.724
You're on your own.

01:33.793 --> 01:35.896
Come on.

01:41.172 --> 01:43.034
- $1,000 in damage?

01:43.103 --> 01:45.379
This cleanup bill
from facilities?

01:45.448 --> 01:47.000
Who wants to help me
count the zeroes?

01:47.068 --> 01:50.241
- Dry cleaning glass out
of my jacket won't be cheap.

01:50.310 --> 01:51.724
Who do I give that bill to?

01:51.793 --> 01:53.758
- Who do I charge
for having to pick clown hair

01:53.827 --> 01:54.965
from my nails all night?

01:55.034 --> 01:56.827
- Enough.

01:56.896 --> 02:01.793
From my understanding,
you threw the first shove.

02:01.862 --> 02:05.379
In that case, I'm leaving
the punishment to London.

02:05.448 --> 02:07.517
- You can't be serious.

02:07.586 --> 02:08.862
- Dead.

02:08.931 --> 02:10.827
You two have been
at each other's throats

02:10.896 --> 02:12.275
all season long.

02:12.344 --> 02:15.206
All this girl drama
is making me sick.

02:24.103 --> 02:26.586
Oh, no.

02:31.965 --> 02:33.586
- Oh.

02:36.862 --> 02:40.965
Okay.

02:41.034 --> 02:43.620
So there's that.

02:43.689 --> 02:45.000
Hoo.

02:45.068 --> 02:47.137
- I'm still trying
to figure out the best way

02:47.206 --> 02:49.827
to deal with stress.

02:49.896 --> 02:52.620
- I think you have a winner.

02:52.689 --> 02:53.827
Oh.

02:53.896 --> 02:55.586
- I never thought
we'd get this close.

02:55.655 --> 02:57.793
- Me either.

02:57.862 --> 03:01.172
- I meant the Devils.
To a title.

03:01.241 --> 03:03.034
- I meant you--
to my--

03:03.103 --> 03:05.000
- Yeah, yeah, no, I got it.

03:06.379 --> 03:08.068
I can't relax.

03:08.137 --> 03:10.931
I either win my first title
as a head coach...

03:11.000 --> 03:14.206
or I coach the last season
of the Devils.

03:14.275 --> 03:16.413
Ever.

03:16.482 --> 03:18.689
If it was up to Eve--
- If it was up to Eve,

03:18.758 --> 03:21.241
we'd all be in hell.

03:21.310 --> 03:23.586
- Not you.

03:27.620 --> 03:29.344
I just wish that
I could calm down,

03:29.413 --> 03:31.620
you know, but I just...

03:37.172 --> 03:38.724
- Whatever I can do to help.

04:15.896 --> 04:18.482
- I'll have this game six spot
ready by noon.

04:18.551 --> 04:20.517
- Jude told me.

04:23.034 --> 04:24.586
- Okay.

04:24.655 --> 04:28.379
He's your best friend.
I broke up with him.

04:28.448 --> 04:30.655
Let me have it.

04:33.241 --> 04:35.724
- No.

04:35.793 --> 04:38.482
I like you, Noah,
and I know you're hurting too.

04:41.379 --> 04:46.034
You're scared to trust.
Especially someone like Jude.

04:46.103 --> 04:47.758
He is my best friend

04:47.827 --> 04:51.517
and I will be the first person
to tell you he has flaws.

04:51.586 --> 04:55.689
But he's also the most
loyal person I've ever met.

04:55.758 --> 04:58.551
If you're looking
for someone to trust...

04:58.620 --> 05:01.551
you couldn't do any better.

05:03.103 --> 05:06.482
I saw someone else
walk away from him.

05:06.551 --> 05:08.931
Be smarter than that

05:09.000 --> 05:13.482
because the next guy
won't let Jude Kinkade go

05:13.551 --> 05:17.310
and it'll be the biggest regret
of your life.

05:27.379 --> 05:29.310
- So what'd you decide
to do about Jamie?

05:29.379 --> 05:31.275
- Make her sweat.

05:31.344 --> 05:34.551
- You have played
this whole season strong

05:34.620 --> 05:36.310
and it has been
a gauntlet, man.

05:36.379 --> 05:37.896
Jamie.
The pastor.

05:37.965 --> 05:39.724
- It's been a gauntlet
for the both of us.

05:39.793 --> 05:43.103
- And we deserve a break,
away from the microscope.

05:44.965 --> 05:46.724
So...

05:46.793 --> 05:48.413
pick one.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.103
- Pick one what?

05:54.275 --> 05:55.758
Derek.

05:55.827 --> 05:57.517
- When the season's over,
we're gonna take off.

05:57.586 --> 05:58.862
Just you and me.

05:58.931 --> 06:01.517
To places no one can bother us.

06:07.758 --> 06:08.965
And bring your Dramamine 'cause

06:09.034 --> 06:11.172
the boat will be rocking.

06:11.241 --> 06:13.379
- You're such a clown.

06:13.448 --> 06:14.379
- But I'm your clown.

06:14.448 --> 06:16.206
- Aw, come here.

06:20.620 --> 06:21.931
- I'm sick of it.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.620
Sick of her.
Sick of him.

06:23.689 --> 06:25.137
The way he just

06:25.206 --> 06:28.275
rushed to her defense,
no questions asked.

06:28.344 --> 06:30.793
- That had to hurt.

06:30.862 --> 06:33.689
- They'll hurt
when you get rid of them.

06:33.758 --> 06:36.896
There's gotta be something else
I can do to help you help me.

06:36.965 --> 06:39.448
- You've done more
than you know.

06:39.517 --> 06:41.275
- What have I done?

06:41.344 --> 06:43.793
- I've got this covered.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.068
Don't worry.

06:49.586 --> 06:51.482
- Putting in the hard yards.

06:54.344 --> 06:55.827
Look I know you've
been struggling.

06:55.896 --> 06:58.413
Thought maybe
you could use a pep talk.

06:58.482 --> 07:00.000
- I have enough pep.

07:00.068 --> 07:01.827
- Physical pep.

07:01.896 --> 07:05.413
Something's going on
between the ears though.

07:05.482 --> 07:07.034
I know the Finals
is new to you.

07:07.103 --> 07:08.931
Probably a little scary.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.931
When I played my first Finals--
- Derek.

07:13.965 --> 07:16.724
I know all I need to know.

07:16.793 --> 07:20.034
I have a job to do
and I'm gonna do it.

07:20.103 --> 07:23.344
- Do you, player.

07:36.413 --> 07:39.724
- They did a good job
cleaning up.

07:39.793 --> 07:43.103
You really went to town
on me there.

07:43.172 --> 07:46.862
Got a mean left hook, girl.
I'll remember that

07:46.931 --> 07:49.655
next time I think about
shooting off my big mouth.

07:49.724 --> 07:53.586
- Save the performance.
You're not Viola Davis.

07:53.655 --> 07:55.931
- Fine.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.896
You wanna know
what my problem is?

07:58.965 --> 08:00.103
- I didn't ask.

08:00.172 --> 08:02.724
- You came into this
already famous.

08:02.793 --> 08:04.793
I didn't stand a chance.

08:04.862 --> 08:07.517
- Girls like you
bug the shit out of me.

08:07.586 --> 08:09.758
Someone else's success
is your failure.

08:09.827 --> 08:11.896
- No, it's not that
I don't want you to succeed.

08:11.965 --> 08:15.758
I just... refuse
to exist in your shadow.

08:15.827 --> 08:17.758
How do you think I feel?

08:17.827 --> 08:20.034
I'm best known for dancing
your choreography.

08:20.103 --> 08:22.241
I couldn't even get
a magazine cover by myself.

08:22.310 --> 08:25.034
Of course
I feel threatened by you.

08:25.103 --> 08:28.931
My success is
directly tied to you.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.344
You don't need me
to be a star,

08:31.413 --> 08:34.551
but I need you.

08:34.620 --> 08:38.689
Maybe that drove me to go
a step too far but growing up,

08:38.758 --> 08:42.827
I had to push this hard
just to keep up.

08:44.379 --> 08:48.000
It's just in me.

08:48.068 --> 08:52.724
But that doesn't always
make it right.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.724
Do your worst.

08:54.793 --> 08:57.034
At least I'll know
I apologized.

08:57.103 --> 08:59.379
- I was wrong.

08:59.448 --> 09:02.896
Maybe you are Viola Davis.

09:02.965 --> 09:06.586
I have no idea
if you mean any of this,

09:06.655 --> 09:09.655
but there's one way
I can find out for sure.

09:09.724 --> 09:12.103
- What is it?

09:12.172 --> 09:13.241
- A test.

09:15.344 --> 09:16.724
- Okay.

09:16.793 --> 09:18.620
- I'll let
bygones be bygones

09:18.689 --> 09:19.793
if...

09:19.862 --> 09:23.517
you sit out the final dance.

09:23.586 --> 09:26.103
- I can't not dance that dance.

09:26.172 --> 09:27.896
It's the biggest dance
of the season.

09:27.965 --> 09:30.344
I-It's the biggest dance
of every season.

09:30.413 --> 09:32.206
- That's why
you sitting it out

09:32.275 --> 09:34.103
will really show me
how sorry you are.

09:40.965 --> 09:43.517
I mean, you're
welcome to dance it,

09:43.586 --> 09:46.310
but then it will be
your last as a Devil Girl.

09:46.379 --> 09:48.413
Your call.

10:02.034 --> 10:04.620
- It was one shove.
Barely a shove.

10:04.689 --> 10:05.965
She's got weak legs.

10:06.034 --> 10:08.862
- And the red carpet stunt
with her ex?

10:08.931 --> 10:11.551
- What are you,
the inventory clerk?

10:11.620 --> 10:14.586
- Yup.
Should I keep listing?

10:14.655 --> 10:17.000
- What else is there to list?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.586
- Where did you hear the rumor

10:21.655 --> 10:24.137
about Derek and Jude
and the coke?

10:24.206 --> 10:26.655
- A concerned citizen.

10:26.724 --> 10:28.241
- It was Eve Vincent.

10:29.931 --> 10:32.586
- Says who?
- Says you.

10:32.655 --> 10:36.724
Right now.
I can see it on your face.

10:36.793 --> 10:38.655
Why are you doing
her dirty work?

10:38.724 --> 10:40.862
- I'm not doing
anyone's dirty work.

10:40.931 --> 10:43.689
- Jamie...

10:43.758 --> 10:47.000
you came here
to make a name for yourself

10:47.068 --> 10:48.413
and you have.

10:48.482 --> 10:53.206
You don't need to swim with
a piranha like Eve Vincent.

10:53.275 --> 10:56.344
I know you're better than that.

10:56.413 --> 10:58.689
I hope you know that too.

11:05.862 --> 11:08.137
- You're doing great.

11:08.206 --> 11:10.620
Every failed pass is
one step closer

11:10.689 --> 11:12.172
to bringing a new team to LA.

11:12.241 --> 11:15.517
- And a new arena
with my brother's name on it.

11:15.586 --> 11:18.413
- Where it should be.

11:18.482 --> 11:20.517
Devils Nation will fall.

11:31.172 --> 11:33.068
- Hey, beautiful.

11:33.137 --> 11:34.931
Got your text.
Where's the fire?

11:35.000 --> 11:38.448
- In my belly.
Fire in my belly...

11:38.517 --> 11:40.413
to tell you something.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.137
- All right.

11:42.206 --> 11:44.965
- Okay, so--

11:45.034 --> 11:48.655
So remember the time that
you took care of little Miguel?

11:48.724 --> 11:50.758
You were so good with him.

11:50.827 --> 11:53.862
- Eh, I gave him a black eye.

11:53.931 --> 11:56.655
- Right.
Well, he had it coming.

11:56.724 --> 11:58.413
The mouth on that kid.

11:58.482 --> 12:01.275
You know, when they're younger,
they can't speak at all.

12:01.344 --> 12:03.068
- Oh, no.

12:03.137 --> 12:04.413
No, no, no.

12:04.482 --> 12:07.586
- No--no.
- No. No.

12:07.655 --> 12:11.137
The only thing I can't handle
more than kids is babies.

12:11.206 --> 12:13.620
They get their mouth juice
on everything.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.551
Their nose juice.

12:15.620 --> 12:17.241
They just got a lot of juice.

12:17.310 --> 12:19.793
I don't care who's asking us to
babysit, it's not gonna happen.

12:19.862 --> 12:22.827
I'll pay for a sitter.
- With what?

12:22.896 --> 12:25.620
- With the money I get
for the kidney I'd rather sell

12:25.689 --> 12:27.103
than wipe up after some juicy--

12:27.172 --> 12:29.689
- They're juicy.
Got it.

12:29.758 --> 12:33.517
- Yeah, ew.
Comes out of everywhere.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.620
- Sure.

12:51.379 --> 12:54.275
- Thanks for coming.

12:54.344 --> 12:57.448
Wanted you to see the house
I'm building here.

12:57.517 --> 12:59.448
Needs some work but it'll come.

12:59.517 --> 13:02.344
- Not even if Jesus returned,
threw down some cardboard,

13:02.413 --> 13:04.758
and started break-dancing
on this very spot.

13:04.827 --> 13:06.172
You said you had a proposal.

13:06.241 --> 13:11.344
I'm double parked,
so this better be...

13:11.413 --> 13:13.758
good.

13:24.793 --> 13:26.827
- Wanted to see
if you'd open it.

13:26.896 --> 13:28.413
Now, I know.

13:28.482 --> 13:31.103
- I clearly didn't slap you
hard enough the last time.

13:31.172 --> 13:34.517
- London, I didn't move to LA
for redemption.

13:34.586 --> 13:36.551
I came for you.

13:36.620 --> 13:38.655
For real.

13:38.724 --> 13:40.551
I failed you.

13:40.620 --> 13:44.103
Baby, I failed us.

13:44.172 --> 13:46.620
The love we had,
it was so big,

13:46.689 --> 13:49.517
it shook the world.
It shook me.

13:49.586 --> 13:51.620
But I'm here now.

13:51.689 --> 13:53.344
I've learned from my mistakes

13:53.413 --> 13:55.586
and now I know
there's still a chance.

13:55.655 --> 13:57.517
- I want you to hear me.

13:57.586 --> 13:59.034
I love Derek.

13:59.103 --> 14:02.137
Whatever we had, it's over.

14:02.206 --> 14:05.896
Even if I didn't have Derek,
it would still be over.

14:05.965 --> 14:08.206
I'm not the same person I was
when we were together.

14:08.275 --> 14:10.655
I know who I am now.
And who you are.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.620
- I'm in love with you.

14:12.689 --> 14:15.965
- Well, then the only soul
that needs saving is yours.

14:21.620 --> 14:23.586
- ISN comes to you live
from Miami

14:23.655 --> 14:25.551
for game six
of the Finals tonight.

14:25.620 --> 14:27.724
Where the home team
trails Los Angeles

14:27.793 --> 14:29.655
two games to three.

14:29.724 --> 14:32.241
The title is on the line.

14:32.310 --> 14:35.275
- Are you a mirage?
What are you doing in Miami?

14:35.344 --> 14:37.034
- You needed
some support before

14:37.103 --> 14:39.482
and I couldn't
give it to you so...

14:39.551 --> 14:41.310
here I am.

14:43.758 --> 14:46.448
Come here, you.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.310
Okay.

14:52.482 --> 14:54.931
How'd that feel?

14:55.000 --> 14:58.551
- I honestly have no idea.

14:58.620 --> 15:00.517
- Win or lose,
you accomplished something

15:00.586 --> 15:02.103
pretty major.

15:02.172 --> 15:03.758
- Yeah, we weren't even
supposed to make it

15:03.827 --> 15:06.000
to the Western Conference.

15:06.068 --> 15:07.379
- I'm not talking about Finals,

15:07.448 --> 15:10.103
I'm talking about me,
being here.

15:10.172 --> 15:12.724
I'm here for you but I also
came to see the game.

15:12.793 --> 15:14.517
I hate sports.

15:14.586 --> 15:17.689
You and this stupid team
got me to care.

15:17.758 --> 15:20.034
Since you've been in the paint,
I give a shit.

15:20.103 --> 15:21.655
- Did you just say,
"In the paint."

15:23.551 --> 15:27.172
See what you've done?

15:27.241 --> 15:29.551
Eve's gonna do
what she's gonna do.

15:29.620 --> 15:31.310
You do what you do.

15:31.379 --> 15:33.655
Coach some damn basketball.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.413
- Yes, Coach.

15:35.482 --> 15:37.275
- Final seconds of game six,

15:37.344 --> 15:40.448
with the score tied
102 to 102.

15:40.517 --> 15:41.793
Oh, Lowe, tripped over
the ball.

15:41.862 --> 15:43.379
Brookes has it and he scores!

15:43.448 --> 15:44.758
Miami wins!

15:44.827 --> 15:46.931
We're going to game seven
in Los Angeles.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.586
- Yeah.

15:48.655 --> 15:50.172
See you in LA, big boy.

15:50.241 --> 15:53.310
Miami Nation, rise up.

15:53.379 --> 15:55.551
- Oh, Pax Lowe must
be really feeling it

15:55.620 --> 15:58.689
after turning the ball over
at such a crucial moment.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.241
- What happened?

16:00.310 --> 16:03.793
- Mistake.
- Well, that one cost us.

16:15.551 --> 16:19.000
- A Devil baby?
Oh, my God, that's so exciting.

16:19.068 --> 16:20.689
Did Beau lose his mind?

16:20.758 --> 16:22.413
- Not yet.
I haven't told him.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.827
He's not really a baby person.
This is gonna require finesse

16:25.896 --> 16:28.758
so I bought
baby-reveal cupcakes.

16:28.827 --> 16:30.172
- A baby-what now?

16:30.241 --> 16:31.896
- They bake
a little baby into them

16:31.965 --> 16:33.551
and when he takes a bite,
I yell, "Surprise!

16:33.620 --> 16:37.000
There's a baby in your cupcake
and in my uterus."

16:37.068 --> 16:39.172
Well, Beau hates babies
but he loves cupcakes.

16:39.241 --> 16:40.965
I'm hoping one
will offset the other.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.931
- Yeah.
Sounds foolproof.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.931
Good luck.
- Mm-hmm.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.758
- Oh, Jesus mother
of Christmas.

16:50.827 --> 16:52.000
Oh, shit.

16:57.896 --> 17:02.000
- Ugh.
What the hell was that?

17:05.206 --> 17:09.551
- You're gonna be a daddy.
- Huh?

17:09.620 --> 17:11.206
- And cupcakes.

17:16.206 --> 17:18.344
- What?

17:18.413 --> 17:19.827
- I'm sorry.

17:19.896 --> 17:21.965
Maybe if your super sperm
weren't so darn aggressive

17:22.034 --> 17:25.206
hammering away
at my poor, defenseless eggs.

17:25.275 --> 17:26.827
- You're pregnant?

17:26.896 --> 17:30.448
- I'm gonna need you to grasp
this just a little quicker.

17:41.689 --> 17:43.724
You're in sugar shock.

17:43.793 --> 17:45.793
- This is amazing!

17:45.862 --> 17:48.310
- Okay, what the hell
is going on?

17:48.379 --> 17:49.862
You hate kids.

17:49.931 --> 17:52.620
- No, I don't hate kids.
Kids hate me.

17:52.689 --> 17:54.586
I'm hoping mine won't.

17:54.655 --> 17:56.931
- So wait, you're okay
with having a baby?

17:57.000 --> 17:58.689
- We're not just having a baby.

17:58.758 --> 18:01.413
We're having Kyle Hart's baby.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.448
What could be better than that?

18:08.689 --> 18:13.241
- Oh, God, can we do this?

18:13.310 --> 18:16.103
We're gonna be in charge
of a little person.

18:16.172 --> 18:19.931
- If we break it,
we'll just make another.

18:23.965 --> 18:26.206
- We're having a baby.

18:26.275 --> 18:28.000
- What?

18:33.827 --> 18:36.310
- I had to see for myself.

18:36.379 --> 18:37.379
- See what?

18:37.448 --> 18:39.827
- The game in Miami.

18:39.896 --> 18:43.068
You're working with Eve.

18:43.137 --> 18:48.034
- If you know that,
then so are you.

18:48.103 --> 18:52.034
- We're on the same side.

18:53.586 --> 18:55.931
Pax...

18:56.000 --> 18:59.551
I'm--I'm sorry.

18:59.620 --> 19:01.586
I didn't mean to hurt you.

19:03.310 --> 19:06.517
That's a lie.
I did mean to hurt you.

19:06.586 --> 19:09.103
I don't know why.

19:09.172 --> 19:13.689
You're not crazy.
I care about you.

19:13.758 --> 19:15.965
Know that.

19:16.034 --> 19:17.620
- You care about Derek?

19:22.310 --> 19:25.793
Are you in love with him?

19:42.103 --> 19:43.793
- Where's the rest
of your stuff?

19:43.862 --> 19:45.172
- I plan on being naked.

19:45.241 --> 19:48.551
- A lot.
- I like that idea a lot.

19:48.620 --> 19:50.310
After the game, we go.

19:50.379 --> 19:53.517
Win or lose.
- Win.

19:56.275 --> 19:57.620
Win.

20:05.413 --> 20:07.379
- Everything okay?

20:13.896 --> 20:15.655
- Couldn't be better.

20:17.275 --> 20:19.413
- Come here.
- Let's go.

20:19.482 --> 20:21.103
- Hi.

20:22.965 --> 20:25.103
- Hey.

20:25.172 --> 20:27.517
- I wanted to say I'm sorry.

20:27.586 --> 20:29.620
I used you.

20:29.689 --> 20:31.931
- You used me?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.896
Used me how?
- As a cover.

20:34.965 --> 20:36.896
You were the mess.

20:36.965 --> 20:40.827
But I'm just as big a mess,
if not more.

20:40.896 --> 20:43.137
I hate secrets
and I was keeping

20:43.206 --> 20:45.517
the biggest secret of all.

20:47.586 --> 20:50.275
It's too late for us,

20:50.344 --> 20:52.586
but it might not be
too late for you.

20:52.655 --> 20:55.000
To show you I'm sorry,
I did some research for you.

20:55.068 --> 20:56.965
So you didn't have to
fight this fight alone.

20:57.034 --> 20:59.689
I watched footage of old games.

20:59.758 --> 21:03.310
Specifically
Eve's greatest hits.

21:03.379 --> 21:06.689
I found something
from the brawl.

21:06.758 --> 21:08.965
Eve was there.

21:09.034 --> 21:12.517
- I know.
- She was alone...

21:12.586 --> 21:14.137
but...

21:14.206 --> 21:18.448
someone was there she did seem
to be a bit chummy with.

21:18.517 --> 21:20.965
Someone I think you'd be
interested to know about.

21:28.137 --> 21:29.655
- Meeting Eve Vincent.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.413
- Right this way.

21:38.275 --> 21:40.482
- Have a seat, Pierce.

21:47.103 --> 21:49.724
- Game seven's about to start.
Shouldn't you be at the arena

21:49.793 --> 21:51.758
rooting for your team?

21:51.827 --> 21:55.068
- We know you've been offering
your services to Eve Vincent.

21:55.137 --> 21:56.965
Playing some of this game
off the court.

21:57.034 --> 22:00.586
- I make it a policy not to
disclose my business dealings.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.172
- How much money
do you think I have?

22:05.241 --> 22:06.931
- I know exactly how much
you have.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.206
I've seen
your divorce settlement.

22:09.275 --> 22:11.689
- No one's seen it.
It's sealed.

22:11.758 --> 22:14.206
- Is it?

22:14.275 --> 22:16.551
- Then you know
whatever Eve's giving you,

22:16.620 --> 22:19.931
my business would be
a lot more lucrative.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.827
- Tell us everything.

22:26.689 --> 22:29.206
- Eve's out for blood.

22:29.275 --> 22:32.379
She's got one of your players
in her pocket.

22:32.448 --> 22:34.448
- Who?

22:34.517 --> 22:36.103
- Pax Lowe.

22:44.758 --> 22:47.034
- Pax Lowe has been a step
behind the whole game

22:47.103 --> 22:49.620
and Miami has been right there
to take advantage of it.

22:52.241 --> 22:54.000
- We're gonna finish
what we started.

22:54.068 --> 22:55.344
You and me.

22:55.413 --> 22:56.931
- And that's halftime.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.896
And time for the final dance
of the season.

25:27.551 --> 25:29.068
- Derek.

25:29.137 --> 25:31.103
- I know.
- You don't.

25:31.172 --> 25:34.068
Eve got to Pax.

25:34.137 --> 25:35.620
You gotta get rid of him.

25:35.689 --> 25:39.068
- That is the least
I'm gonna do.

25:41.413 --> 25:43.310
- I hope I didn't miss much.

25:43.379 --> 25:45.620
I was just having a chat
with a friend of yours.

25:45.689 --> 25:47.344
Pierce?

25:47.413 --> 25:49.310
We know about Pax.

25:49.379 --> 25:52.620
And right about now,
so does Derek.

25:54.827 --> 25:59.413
- Time for one more tattoo
you snake ass piece of shit.

26:07.275 --> 26:08.517
- After everything
I did for you.

26:08.586 --> 26:10.137
You think
you could get away with it?

26:10.206 --> 26:13.931
- And you think you can
get away with what you did?

26:14.000 --> 26:16.758
- Get back to the tunnel now.

26:21.620 --> 26:23.172
How could you work with Eve?

26:23.241 --> 26:24.620
Huh?

26:24.689 --> 26:26.586
After she tried
to cut you from the team.

26:26.655 --> 26:29.137
- At least Eve didn't pretend
to be my friend.

26:29.206 --> 26:31.206
And use me
on the court to cheat.

26:31.275 --> 26:32.862
- Cheat?
Cheat what?

26:32.931 --> 26:35.448
- Portland.

26:35.517 --> 26:37.275
Don't bother denying it.

26:37.344 --> 26:39.482
I was there
and I knew something was up.

26:39.551 --> 26:41.724
- It was a one-time thing.
I had to do it--

26:41.793 --> 26:43.137
- Oh, one-time thing?

26:43.206 --> 26:44.655
- It had nothing
to do with you.

26:44.724 --> 26:46.586
- I was on the damn court!
You dragged me into it!

26:46.655 --> 26:49.793
- I kept you away from it!

26:49.862 --> 26:52.310
I protected you.

26:52.379 --> 26:55.862
Just like I was protecting
someone else.

26:55.931 --> 26:59.103
You have been affecting play
way more than I have.

26:59.172 --> 27:00.724
But that's okay?

27:03.172 --> 27:05.655
- You were right.

27:05.724 --> 27:09.655
When you said
you weren't my brother.

27:09.724 --> 27:12.344
Marcus never would have done
what you did.

27:17.620 --> 27:21.862
He never would have done
what I did either.

27:21.931 --> 27:26.758
She promised to keep
Marcus's memory alive.

27:26.827 --> 27:30.758
She made me choose
between him and you.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.275
I wanna play this right.

27:36.344 --> 27:38.448
Not for you, not for him,
but for me.

27:41.034 --> 27:44.689
He's not here, but I am.

27:44.758 --> 27:47.655
I earned this.

27:47.724 --> 27:49.793
- Whatever you need
to work out,

27:49.862 --> 27:51.931
you're gonna have to do it
from the bench.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.103
I can't afford
to have you on the court.

27:54.172 --> 27:57.862
- You can't afford not to.

28:01.931 --> 28:04.620
- Jude.

28:04.689 --> 28:07.655
He's playing.
- No, the hell he is.

28:07.724 --> 28:09.724
If you won't pull him, I will.

28:09.793 --> 28:11.620
- Trust me.

28:11.689 --> 28:15.413
- Look, Derek,
you know what's at stake here.

28:15.482 --> 28:17.862
This is my team.

28:17.931 --> 28:20.103
- It's my team too.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.103
- Both teams
have come out strong

28:33.172 --> 28:35.000
after the half.

28:35.068 --> 28:37.137
Pax Lowe looks
to have found some focus.

28:37.206 --> 28:38.413
- Whoo!

28:41.827 --> 28:44.103
- Nothing more
either of us can do.

28:44.172 --> 28:46.931
Whatever moves are left
are gonna happen out there.

28:56.172 --> 28:58.310
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

28:58.379 --> 29:00.172
- Whoo!
- Noah.

29:00.241 --> 29:02.517
Noah.
Give me your phone.

29:07.172 --> 29:08.758
Pick up your damn phone.

29:08.827 --> 29:12.206
- It's Eve, leave a message.

29:16.344 --> 29:19.034
- The Devils have come back
from behind to tie it up.

29:19.103 --> 29:21.965
The title is on the line
with just seconds left to go

29:22.034 --> 29:24.172
in the game.

29:38.758 --> 29:42.413
And the Devils
are the champions!

29:44.551 --> 29:46.448
- We did it.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

29:56.034 --> 29:58.172
- Congratulations,
LA Devils,

29:58.241 --> 30:00.275
and well done to you, big guy.

30:11.793 --> 30:13.896
- Yeah!

30:29.379 --> 30:33.000
all: Derek! Derek! Derek!
- Hey!

30:36.275 --> 30:38.379
- Well done, you.
- Well done, you.

30:38.448 --> 30:40.000
You gonna make me wait
for godfather or what?

30:40.068 --> 30:42.068
- Mm, just running your credit
after that yacht buy.

30:42.137 --> 30:44.517
I have twelve other cards
and an off-shore account

30:44.586 --> 30:45.896
in the Cayman Islands.

30:45.965 --> 30:49.620
- Goddaddy, come here!

30:49.689 --> 30:52.448
- Mm, where's your girl?

30:52.517 --> 30:54.827
- She'll be here.

30:54.896 --> 30:56.827
- London.

30:56.896 --> 30:59.413
- Derek's waiting for me.
- Two minutes.

30:59.482 --> 31:02.965
Then I'll be out
your life forever.

31:12.620 --> 31:15.379
- Why would she text you here?

31:15.448 --> 31:17.827
Where is she?

31:19.275 --> 31:23.000
- There.

31:27.413 --> 31:29.103
- Kyle.

31:29.172 --> 31:31.206
- Hey, congratulations, buddy.

31:31.275 --> 31:33.034
- Can I pick a winner or what?

31:33.103 --> 31:36.275
- You didn't pick one,
you created one.

31:36.344 --> 31:38.724
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

31:38.793 --> 31:42.275
- Aw.
That is so true.

31:42.344 --> 31:46.724
- And my contract next year
is gonna be sweet.

31:46.793 --> 31:50.206
- And I haven't forgotten...

31:50.275 --> 31:52.068
you get 5%.

31:52.137 --> 31:53.551
- Oh.
- Baller money?

31:53.620 --> 31:55.482
I'm getting baller money?
- Mm-hmm.

31:55.551 --> 31:58.000
- I'm not knocked up and poor,
I'm knocked up and rich.

31:58.068 --> 31:59.379
- Yeah, we.

31:59.448 --> 32:02.275
- Knocked up?
- I'm gonna be a mommy.

32:02.344 --> 32:04.724
- Oh, my God.

32:04.793 --> 32:07.034
A mini Kyle?
- Well, it could be a boy.

32:07.103 --> 32:09.103
- Well, there's nothing a wig
and some size one stilettos

32:09.172 --> 32:10.517
can't handle.

32:10.586 --> 32:13.827
Gonna have me a drag baby.

32:13.896 --> 32:16.206
- Hey, have you seen London?
- She's still not here?

32:19.310 --> 32:23.000
- You know I can move you.
- Try.

32:23.068 --> 32:24.517
You didn't answer
any of my texts.

32:24.586 --> 32:27.275
- My phone is in Derek's trunk
in my suitcase.

32:27.344 --> 32:28.862
We're going away for a while.

32:28.931 --> 32:30.827
So you'll just have to face
your life without me.

32:30.896 --> 32:33.034
- That's just it,
I can't.

32:33.103 --> 32:35.344
I've given up
everything for you.

32:35.413 --> 32:39.206
My church.
My wife.

32:39.275 --> 32:41.448
If you leave me--
- I've already left.

32:41.517 --> 32:43.206
- Not yet.

32:43.275 --> 32:46.517
You haven't gotten
on that boat.

32:46.586 --> 32:49.724
- Who said anything
about a boat?

32:49.793 --> 32:53.034
- Look, the worst mistake
I've ever made

32:53.103 --> 32:54.344
was letting you out
of my sight.

32:54.413 --> 32:56.241
I'm not doing that again.

32:56.310 --> 32:59.724
- Curtis.
- Just one kiss.

32:59.793 --> 33:01.000
That's all I ask.

33:12.724 --> 33:16.379
- Go back, Lionel.

33:16.448 --> 33:20.517
I called German, not you.

33:20.586 --> 33:23.241
I don't want you here for this.

33:23.310 --> 33:25.379
- What is this?

33:25.448 --> 33:27.655
- The only thing
I have left to do

33:27.724 --> 33:31.689
that can hurt
The Devils tonight.

33:31.758 --> 33:33.586
You got your win...

33:35.655 --> 33:39.172
But let's see what
the headlines are tomorrow.

33:44.655 --> 33:46.137
Poetic, no?

33:46.206 --> 33:47.655
- Eve.

33:47.724 --> 33:52.586
- I said go.
- I'm not going anywhere.

33:52.655 --> 33:57.620
Eve, this isn't poetic,
it's stupid.

33:57.689 --> 33:59.068
- Stupid?

33:59.137 --> 34:04.620
- I can say that because
I tried the same damn thing.

34:04.689 --> 34:09.551
I got low once
and made a bad decision...

34:09.620 --> 34:13.758
but I got a second chance
and you can too.

34:13.827 --> 34:17.413
- A second chance?

34:17.482 --> 34:20.103
A second chance at what?

34:22.034 --> 34:25.068
What do I have?

34:25.137 --> 34:26.758
If it weren't for The Devils--

34:26.827 --> 34:28.862
- If it weren't for The Devils,

34:28.931 --> 34:31.896
Olivia never would have
met Chase.

34:31.965 --> 34:35.724
They never would have been
celebrated for what they did.

34:35.793 --> 34:38.068
The name Vincent
means something

34:38.137 --> 34:39.793
because of The Devils.

34:39.862 --> 34:42.413
- If it wasn't
for The Devils,

34:42.482 --> 34:47.206
we wouldn't
have met you.

34:47.275 --> 34:50.206
And you wouldn't have met us.

34:50.275 --> 34:54.275
- I know your secret, German.

34:54.344 --> 34:57.034
You want this.
- No, I don't.

34:59.206 --> 35:02.379
And neither do you.

35:02.448 --> 35:06.551
You didn't call me up here
to see this.

35:06.620 --> 35:08.965
You called me up here
to stop it.

35:15.758 --> 35:18.931
- I don't want to be
this angry anymore.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.586
- You don't have to be.

35:22.655 --> 35:26.241
Keeping it alive
won't keep her alive.

36:13.724 --> 36:17.103
Where do I go from here?

36:17.172 --> 36:19.448
- That's up to you.

36:19.517 --> 36:22.103
But you won't be going alone.

36:22.172 --> 36:23.931
- I care about you.

36:26.827 --> 36:31.379
The both of you.

36:31.448 --> 36:34.793
And I know how you each feel
about each other.

36:37.448 --> 36:39.241
- Someone has to lose.

36:45.620 --> 36:50.620
- Well, why does
someone have to?

36:58.655 --> 37:00.241
- Sex with the owner
on his desk?

37:00.310 --> 37:02.793
I am such a slut.

37:02.862 --> 37:04.896
No, no, I'm fine with it.
- I'm more than fine with it.

37:04.965 --> 37:06.655
- There's no one else

37:06.724 --> 37:09.655
I'd wanna celebrate with.

37:09.724 --> 37:11.758
You are as much part
of this win as anyone.

37:11.827 --> 37:14.379
What you did for me...

37:14.448 --> 37:16.034
- We make a good team.

37:19.482 --> 37:21.413
- There's, um...

37:21.482 --> 37:23.172
One more thing.

37:23.241 --> 37:26.827
Something I've been afraid
to tell you but...

37:26.896 --> 37:28.517
I have to.

37:28.586 --> 37:29.620
- What is it?

37:33.551 --> 37:35.034
- I love you...

37:35.103 --> 37:37.206
Noah.

37:40.379 --> 37:43.172
- I love you too, Jude.

37:55.413 --> 37:57.724
- Everyone is staring at as.

37:57.793 --> 37:58.965
- They're staring at you
because you've been

37:59.034 --> 38:00.793
a huge bitch.

38:00.862 --> 38:02.241
This is where
you start to make it up

38:02.310 --> 38:06.137
by apologizing to a few people.

38:06.206 --> 38:07.413
- What's she doing here?

38:07.482 --> 38:09.172
- She's with me.

38:09.241 --> 38:11.275
- Me too.

38:13.379 --> 38:17.517
- Okay, then.
Hmm.

38:23.896 --> 38:26.172
- Whoa, hey, hey, hey.
- Hey.

38:26.241 --> 38:27.931
- Where you been?

38:28.000 --> 38:29.551
- Just changing.

38:29.620 --> 38:30.862
- Are you okay?

38:30.931 --> 38:32.586
- Yeah.

38:32.655 --> 38:34.379
Have you been waiting here
the whole time?

38:34.448 --> 38:37.206
- Yeah.

38:53.517 --> 38:56.379
- I... couldn't do it.

38:56.448 --> 38:58.931
I couldn't sabotage the team.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.758
- I'm glad.

39:01.827 --> 39:03.758
Seeing you that dark, I--

39:03.827 --> 39:05.379
I didn't like it.

39:15.241 --> 39:17.586
I'm sorry.

39:17.655 --> 39:19.379
- For what?

39:19.448 --> 39:22.034
- I had this thing
that needed to happen.

39:22.103 --> 39:23.620
Just ten points in a game.

39:23.689 --> 39:25.206
- Turn it up.

39:25.275 --> 39:26.655
- Derek was only helping me
out of a jam.

39:26.724 --> 39:29.379
Trust me.

39:29.448 --> 39:30.965
It was one game.

39:31.034 --> 39:32.448
At the beginning
of the season.

39:32.517 --> 39:34.827
I swear, it's nothing.

39:34.896 --> 39:39.000
- What the hell is this?

39:39.068 --> 39:41.034
- It wasn't me.

39:46.172 --> 39:47.862
- It's the coach,
the captain,

39:47.931 --> 39:49.689
who knows how
many of his teammates.

39:49.758 --> 39:52.275
The owner let this happen.

39:52.344 --> 39:55.379
This is the end
of the Los Angeles Devils.

40:06.655 --> 40:08.000
- Major news
coming out of ISN.

40:08.068 --> 40:10.275
- ISN reporting
a Devils fixing scandal.

40:10.344 --> 40:12.206
- Derek Roman conspired
with the Devils head coach,

40:12.275 --> 40:14.896
German Vega,
to fix an early season game.

40:14.965 --> 40:16.724
- Roman held the ball
keeping the game

40:16.793 --> 40:18.344
to a ten-point spread.

40:18.413 --> 40:20.724
- No word yet if other players
were involved.

40:20.793 --> 40:22.724
- In flagrant violation
of league rules.

40:22.793 --> 40:25.034
- Sending shockwaves
through the sport.

40:25.103 --> 40:26.413
- It's a one-and-done season
for Devils owner,

40:26.482 --> 40:28.034
Jude Kinkade.

40:28.103 --> 40:30.517
- The Devils are done.
- The Devils are done.

40:30.586 --> 40:33.586
- There will be a new team
in Los Angeles next season.

40:33.655 --> 40:34.862
You can bet on that.
