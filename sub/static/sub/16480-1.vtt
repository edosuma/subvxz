You were eating cow poo!

I missed your call.

wiping cow poo off our sons.

You go away, you come back.

11:04.747 --> 11:07.466
You vanish into the Antarctic for weeks at a time

11:07.625 --> 11:09.002
and I can't contact you.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.341
That's the job.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.881
Why don't I go record the sounds of the whales?

11:13.047 --> 11:14.674
You stay here and do my job.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.059

- No friends, no family.

I know it wasn't much of a career,
but I miss doing my gigs.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.937
- I know.
- Singing my little songs.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.150
- I know!
- You don't!

11:28.271 --> 11:30.273
Don't say you know when you don't know.

11:31.983 --> 11:35.237
You have your whales and your work.

11:35.403 --> 11:38.077

and another who refuses to defecate.

11:43.995 --> 11:45.463
It's not forever.

11:45.622 --> 11:48.091
- Remember the deal?
- Yeah, I remember.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.796
Your deal.
The deal you proposed to me.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.927
You look after the kids till they start school,

11:52.086 --> 11:53.508
then it's my turn.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.969
They won't go to school for another 8 billion years.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.385
You said you wanted to support me
doing something important.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.098
And I do.

12:00.261 --> 12:03.231
You said you were sick of
singing to drunks in London pubs.

12:03.389 --> 12:06.393
You wanted this. You loved
the idea of coming here.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.436
Look around you.
It's beautiful.

12:08.603 --> 12:10.776
Can you go check on the kids?

12:11.981 --> 12:14.075
El, the whales are here,

12:14.234 --> 12:15.986
and unless they start swimming up the Thames...

12:16.152 --> 12:18.996
You can't leave 'em alone in
the chicken coop. It'll be chaos.

12:27.705 --> 12:30.208

my succulents.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.589

Hello.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.314
My husband gave me this web-cam

18:18.472 --> 18:20.440
so that I could communicate with him,

18:20.600 --> 18:22.273
but he's not there.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.858
So I've decided to talk to you instead.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.991
Well, sing, actually.

18:28.149 --> 18:30.493
Hang on.
I'll go see if you're there.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.123
You're not there.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.209
I'm talking to myself again.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.299
He was standing in front of me

18:53.466 --> 18:54.843
with this deadly serious face

18:55.009 --> 18:56.761
and he absolutely looked like his father.

18:58.095 --> 19:00.939
So I said to him in my best serious mother voice,

19:01.098 --> 19:04.022
"Well, darling, that's because
Sophie doesn't have testicles!"

19:04.185 --> 19:05.732
Sorry! My ball.

19:07.396 --> 19:10.275
- So, what did he say?
- I dropped my ball.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.579
Sorry, finish your story.

19:15.738 --> 19:18.116
Um, and he said,

19:18.282 --> 19:19.829
"But why doesn't Sophie have testicles, Mummy?

19:19.992 --> 19:21.539
"Did they fall off?"

19:28.000 --> 19:30.173
Did you need something?

19:30.336 --> 19:31.804
Um...

19:31.962 --> 19:33.635
Mind if I join you?

19:33.798 --> 19:36.176
Uh...

19:38.761 --> 19:40.729
- Um, yeah, sure.
- Sit down.

I'm just checking my web cam back home.

37:31.499 --> 37:33.342
I've hidden it in a pot plant.

37:33.501 --> 37:35.378
You've hidden it?

37:35.545 --> 37:37.218
Yeah - I've turned it
into a nanny cam

That's alright, Mary.
I'm sorry about the swearing.

38:05.825 --> 38:07.327
Oh, I should have realised who you were,

38:07.494 --> 38:09.246
but Mrs Dickens said you were out of contact...

38:09.412 --> 38:11.540
No, no. It's fine.

38:11.706 --> 38:14.630
Would you like me to take them out for a bit of a walk

41:03.962 --> 41:05.964
Sorry.

Hi, Mary. It's Elspeth.

41:08.967 --> 41:11.766
I'm just checking in to see
how you and the boys are doing.

41:11.928 --> 41:15.023
Um, give me a buzz back
when you get this message. Thanks.

41:25.942 --> 41:28.036
Ready?

41:29.153 --> 41:31.497
- Alright.
- Yeah?

41:33.992 --> 41:35.960
Wait!

41:48.006 --> 41:49.929
Enter.

41:51.926 --> 41:55.556
Well! You look
all shiny and new.

41:55.722 --> 41:57.941
Eight hours sleep without a single
toddler finger up your nostril

41:58.099 --> 42:00.773
will do that for you.

42:00.935 --> 42:02.903
Thanks for having me.

42:03.062 --> 42:06.692
I just can't believe it.
It's a dream.

42:06.858 --> 42:09.031
Ralph, fetch the Goddess.

42:19.912 --> 42:22.335
- Tada.
- I love it.

42:22.498 --> 42:24.592
It's beautiful.

42:24.751 --> 42:26.719
Goddess.

42:26.878 --> 42:28.926
For all the women you are.

42:29.088 --> 42:31.511
Is that a line from the ad?

42:31.674 --> 42:34.427
That's THE line.
My line, actually.

42:34.594 --> 42:38.064
And strictly speaking, it's not an ad, it's a webisode.

42:38.222 --> 42:39.815
A series of webisodes.

42:39.974 --> 42:43.774
So the idea is, right, to post a whole bunch of clips

42:43.936 --> 42:45.313
of you singing on the Net,

42:45.480 --> 42:46.902
and in each clip, you'll play

42:47.065 --> 42:49.238
one of these different characters.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.653
And then you'll use your Goddess computer

42:51.819 --> 42:53.742
to solve any little problems that might arise.

42:53.905 --> 42:55.999
Have you had a chance to read the scripts yet?

42:56.157 --> 42:59.411
- Great.
- Big day tomorrow.

42:59.577 --> 43:02.877
- Are you ready?
- Mm-hm.

43:13.966 --> 43:15.934
- Hello?
- Oh, hi!

43:16.094 --> 43:17.812
Hey.

43:17.970 --> 43:21.850
- So, you got a gig.
- Yeah.

43:22.016 --> 43:25.270
It's a Web thing.
Son of ads but on the Net.

43:25.436 --> 43:27.780
- So you're back.
- Yep. Yep.

43:27.939 --> 43:29.657
I left a million messages for you,

43:29.816 --> 43:31.489
but you weren't there, and I thought,

43:31.651 --> 43:33.904
"He wouldn't want me to miss
an opportunity like this."

43:34.070 --> 43:35.788
So I took the plunge.

43:35.947 --> 43:37.745

Isn't she great?

43:37.907 --> 43:40.376
Um...

43:40.535 --> 43:42.537
- Yeah.
- How are the whales?

43:42.703 --> 43:45.297
- How did it go?
- Fine. Good. It went well.

43:45.456 --> 43:46.833
Don't be angry with me, James.

43:46.999 --> 43:48.797
The opportunity came up and I took it.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.553
Fine.

43:50.711 --> 43:52.759
Don't say it's fine when you don't mean it.

43:52.922 --> 43:54.799
- I do mean it.
- No, you don't. You're angry.

43:54.966 --> 43:57.515
I'm not angry. I just wasn't
expecting you to be away.

43:57.677 --> 43:59.600
- Yeah, well, I am.
- Yeah, you are.

43:59.762 --> 44:01.890
When you're away, do I call up and pick fights with you?

44:02.056 --> 44:04.275
Picking fights?
I'm not the one picking fights!

44:04.433 --> 44:05.935
Why would you accuse me of picking fights

44:06.102 --> 44:07.820

♪ And people... ♪

50:26.732 --> 50:29.576
So that's the Megaptera novaeangliae.

50:29.735 --> 50:32.830
- That's the humpback whale.
- Moo!

50:32.988 --> 50:37.619
No, that's a cow, OK?
But this...

50:37.785 --> 50:39.287
Thank you.

50:39.453 --> 50:41.956
That's the noise he makes as well.

50:42.122 --> 50:44.545
So this...

50:44.708 --> 50:47.757
...is the Globicephala melaena -
that's the pilot whale.

50:50.005 --> 50:51.803
That's the mighty sperm whale.

50:51.966 --> 50:54.014
'Bye, chaps.
Wish me luck.

50:56.053 --> 51:00.809
Darling, Botticelli's Venus doesn't have any clothes.

51:00.975 --> 51:02.818
Can't I be the Mona Lisa instead, then?

51:02.977 --> 51:07.483
No, precious. You're a goddess.
That's the whole point.

51:07.648 --> 51:11.118
I'm not a goddess.
I'm a mother with stretch marks.

51:11.277 --> 51:14.451
We can fix all that.
Trust me. You'll look perfect.

51:14.613 --> 51:16.786
But isn't the whole point that I'm not perfect?

51:16.949 --> 51:19.748
That I'm a normal mother who still has a life?

51:19.910 --> 51:21.787
Angel, the earth mother is dead.

51:21.954 --> 51:24.798
People want to see mums portrayed as bold and sexy.

51:24.957 --> 51:26.834
I don't want to take my clothes off.

51:27.001 --> 51:30.255
I'm a singer, not a centrefold.

51:30.421 --> 51:32.970
Ralph!

51:39.513 --> 51:43.108
Ah... Elspeth,
I think you look... hot.

51:43.267 --> 51:47.773
But not like a... not a dirty hot.
Like a... a... a classy hot.

51:47.938 --> 51:50.782
And... you know,
and twice as rich.

51:50.941 --> 51:52.614
Your hair's covering
your boo... hip... your bips.

51:52.776 --> 51:54.619
Your... your bits.

51:55.863 --> 51:57.740
Do you think we could use a model's body

51:57.906 --> 51:59.533
and just stick her head on it?

51:59.700 --> 52:00.872
You're missing the point!

52:01.035 --> 52:02.753
I don't feel right about being plastered

52:02.911 --> 52:03.878
over the arse end of a bus

52:04.038 --> 52:05.506
with whoever's body I happen to be wearing

52:05.664 --> 52:07.541
stark bloody naked!

52:22.222 --> 52:24.224
Hello?

52:28.312 --> 52:30.406
Cassandra?

52:35.110 --> 52:36.862
Cassandra?

52:47.665 --> 52:50.293
Do you want people to hear your songs?

52:50.459 --> 52:52.302
Yes, of course.

52:52.461 --> 52:54.634
Then you need exposure.

52:55.673 --> 52:57.801
- Yeah, but I didn't think...
- Everything costs.

52:57.966 --> 52:59.559
Everything has a price.

52:59.718 --> 53:02.471
You want some of this, you give up some of that.

53:02.638 --> 53:04.481
I'm sorry, I just don't think I should give up...

53:04.640 --> 53:06.517
Oh, come on, Elspeth -
both you and I know

53:06.684 --> 53:09.528
you would do backflips naked across Sydney Harbour Bridge

53:09.687 --> 53:11.360
to get where you want to go.

53:12.606 --> 53:14.529
And that's OK.

53:14.692 --> 53:17.445
But be that person.

53:17.611 --> 53:21.115
Don't pretend to be this dreary little house mouse

53:21.281 --> 53:23.409
clutching onto her modesty.

53:23.575 --> 53:25.873
It's dishonest.

53:26.036 --> 53:29.916
I don't want to be naked.
That's not dishonest.

53:30.082 --> 53:33.461
What is dishonest is wasting time in here

53:33.627 --> 53:36.176
so you can feel better about making the compromise

53:36.338 --> 53:38.261
you know you have to make out there.

53:38.424 --> 53:40.392
What is dishonest is keeping

53:40.551 --> 53:43.395
an entire studio full of professionals waiting

53:43.554 --> 53:45.397
while you pretend you're not

53:45.556 --> 53:47.103
an extremely ambitious young woman

53:47.266 --> 53:49.394
who knows exactly what she must do

53:49.560 --> 53:51.403
to get where she wants to go.

53:51.562 --> 53:55.192
That is dishonest.

54:04.742 --> 54:07.495
Breathe. Take a deep breath.

54:09.538 --> 54:13.133
Take a break.
Take a moment for yourself.

54:13.292 --> 54:15.386
And then it's back out there to do the job

54:15.544 --> 54:17.592
you're being paid to do.

- Oh, no.

57:12.387 --> 57:13.809
No, no, no, that's great!

57:13.972 --> 57:15.724

57:17.559 --> 57:19.903
So, drum roll, please.

57:20.062 --> 57:22.906
Cassandra pitched an idea to the client.

57:23.065 --> 57:26.911
I have suggested that instead of wasting Elspeth Dickens

57:27.069 --> 57:28.992
on the Asia-Pacific campaign,

57:29.154 --> 57:31.248
they use her to spearhead the...

57:31.406 --> 57:32.908
..international launch!

57:33.075 --> 57:35.373
Rich! Rich!
You'll be rich, I tell ya!

57:35.535 --> 57:38.379
They've asked for a day or two
to consult the powers that be,

57:38.538 --> 57:41.963
but what this means in the
short term is that I need you here,

57:42.125 --> 57:44.127
ready to jump when they say jump.

57:44.294 --> 57:48.015
Oh, that's great, but I'm on the six o'clock ﬂight.

57:48.173 --> 57:50.676
- Uh, no, cancelled it.
- But the kids, James!

57:50.842 --> 57:52.515
They're expecting me home.

57:52.678 --> 57:55.101
Don't get me wrong.
This is wonderful.

57:55.263 --> 57:57.186
But I have to have a conversation with my husband...

57:57.349 --> 58:00.398
Ralph, go to the lobby and fetch me
a sparkling mineral water.

58:00.560 --> 58:01.982
Yep. There's one
in the minibar.

58:02.145 --> 58:03.863
- Ralph?
- Mmm?

58:06.108 --> 58:09.487
Oh! Exiting stage left.

58:17.577 --> 58:20.922
I was tough on you the other day, I know.

58:21.081 --> 58:23.004
But I only said what I said

58:23.166 --> 58:25.885
because the big time is barrelling towards you

58:26.044 --> 58:27.591
like a freight train.

58:27.754 --> 58:29.176
It will only come once.

58:29.339 --> 58:31.842
There will only be one opportunity to get on board.

58:32.009 --> 58:33.727
And if you don't take your seat now,

58:33.885 --> 58:35.853
then some other lucky girl will.

58:36.013 --> 58:38.892
And your chance will pass.

58:39.057 --> 58:41.606
Forever.

58:48.525 --> 58:50.903
If you're going to make this work,
then you need to let...

58:51.069 --> 58:53.367
- What's his name, your husband?
- James.

58:53.530 --> 58:57.410
Then you need to let James carry more of the load.

58:58.785 --> 59:00.287
We have a deal.

59:00.454 --> 59:03.207
We agreed I'd be the main carer until the kids were...

59:03.373 --> 59:05.592
Deal, schmeal.

59:05.751 --> 59:10.632
Opportunities like this come once in a lifetime.

59:10.797 --> 59:15.143
You need to renegotiate your deal.

59:18.055 --> 59:20.604
- I guess I'll get Mary back.
- Why can't you do it?

59:20.766 --> 59:23.770
I can for a bit, but I've got to go
back to work on Wednesday,

59:23.935 --> 59:25.858
and if you can't say how long you're gonna be...

59:26.021 --> 59:28.319
James, I want to renegotiate our deal.

59:28.482 --> 59:30.359
Yeah, whose big idea was that in the first place?

59:30.525 --> 59:33.779
Mine. I'm not blaming you.
I'm just asking you to review it.

59:33.945 --> 59:35.413
You threw the deal out the window

59:35.572 --> 59:37.324
the moment you took off for Sydney.

59:37.491 --> 59:39.334
Don't be pretending to ask my permission.

59:39.493 --> 59:41.791
You don't seriously expect me
to tell these people to go away

59:41.953 --> 59:43.330
until the twins went to school

59:43.497 --> 59:45.716
because that's when it's my
husband's turn to look after them,

59:45.874 --> 59:47.592
so that's when I could work?

59:47.751 --> 59:50.300
I expected you to do exactly what you wanted to do,

59:50.462 --> 59:52.135
and that's what you've done -
shock, horror.

59:52.297 --> 59:53.674
What's the matter with you?

59:53.840 --> 59:55.217
Don't you want this for me?

59:55.383 --> 59:57.636
For us?
Don't you want this money?

59:57.803 --> 01:00:01.023
Three cheers for Elspeth, bringing home the big bucks.

01:00:01.181 --> 01:00:03.024
You're all snippy because you're tired,

01:00:03.183 --> 01:00:06.232
'cause you're looking after twin terrors 24/7.

01:00:06.394 --> 01:00:09.238
Try doing it for two and a half bloody years.

01:00:09.397 --> 01:00:11.195
Try shoving your head up your bum!

01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:13.281
Interesting how calm and rational you can be

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:15.241
when I'm the one stuck at home.

01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:17.280
But as soon as the shoe is on the other foot...

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:18.790
- Hey, Elspeth.
- What?

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:20.326
This!

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:42.139
Hey, goddess lady!
Whoa! It's me.

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:45.354
Hey, I've been watching your stuff on YouTube.

01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:47.360
You're... You're awesome.

01:00:47.519 --> 01:00:49.613
No, I'm not. I'm rubbish.

01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:52.194
Oh. It's like that, is it?

01:00:52.357 --> 01:00:56.328
I'm a sellout.
I don't do anything properly.

01:00:56.486 --> 01:01:00.366
I'm a crap wife, a crap mother and a terrible person.

01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:10.209

You are Elspeth Dickens, mother,

You are Elspeth Dickens, wife,

and your husband's name is James, James...

01:05:35.223 --> 01:05:38.568
- Is she writing a song?
- I don't think so.

01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:40.399
James, James, James.

01:05:47.444 --> 01:05:49.321
Oh... There you are.

01:05:49.487 --> 01:05:52.366
Oh. Oh, my God. That's him.

01:05:52.532 --> 01:05:56.127
That's the husband. That's her
kitchen. She's switched us over.

01:06:24.772 --> 01:06:27.491
Come on!
You worked the last time.

01:06:30.111 --> 01:06:32.910
- Come on.
- Have you tried pulling it?

01:06:33.072 --> 01:06:35.871
- What?
- Um, the knob.

01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:37.877
Sorry?

01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:40.334
Sorry.

I'm the babysitter.

01:06:47.086 --> 01:06:49.509
Oh, Cherry.
What happened to Mary?

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:52.016
She's with another family, I think.

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:55.349
Oh, well. You're here.
That's great. I'm James.

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:57.765
- Hi, James.
- Come and meet the, uh...

01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:01.150
- The children?
- The children.

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:07.949

Oh, jeepers.

01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:15.031
What's wrong?
Did they do a poo?

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:16.666
No poo.

01:07:16.824 --> 01:07:19.122
Hello, little ones.

01:07:19.285 --> 01:07:21.504
If you don't do a poo, you're gonna explode.

01:07:21.663 --> 01:07:24.633
Boom!

01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:26.919
Uh, hey. Who wants
to make playdough?

01:07:27.085 --> 01:07:30.009
Do you want to make playdough?
Let's do that. Yeah.

01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:32.424
- A little Elmo.
- A little Elmo.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.809
Little arms.

01:07:37.762 --> 01:07:39.309
Can I get you anything before you go'?

01:07:39.472 --> 01:07:41.725
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Alright. Hey...

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:43.689
Boys, we're gonna make a cake, aren't we?

01:07:43.851 --> 01:07:46.900
Cake! Cake! Cake!
Cake! Cake!

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:48.610
This playdough's hard work.

01:07:52.527 --> 01:07:54.996
Oh, you go whenever you need to.

01:07:55.154 --> 01:07:57.407
- I don't have to go just yet.
- Oh.

01:07:57.574 --> 01:08:00.077
- OK.
- OK. Yep.

01:08:00.243 --> 01:08:01.210
Mummy!

01:08:01.369 --> 01:08:02.916
We've got no right to be doing this.

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:04.922
They don't even know there's a camera there.

01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:06.799
Which makes it reality TV at its finest.

01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:11.259
- Mummy! Mummy!
- Not now, Napoleon!

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:20.229
Should we ask Daddy to be our guinea pig?

01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:22.435
Yeah? Alright.

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:26.185
Open wide.

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:32.075
- Oh, no. Oops.
- That's really yummy.

01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:33.654
Mmm!

01:08:35.069 --> 01:08:36.912
Oh, that... That is good.

01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:39.493
- Good work.
- Mmm!

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:47.920
- Oh, look! What's that?
- Cake!

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:51.006
- You're not Mary.
- I want cake!

01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:52.716
But first, Daddy's gonna ice it.

01:08:52.879 --> 01:08:55.051
I can't.
I'll bugger it up.

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:57.888
- He'll just get in the way.
- Oh, here.

01:08:58.051 --> 01:09:00.349
- Oh, Elspeth doesn't like this.
- What?

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:02.184
- What?
- Two people in the kitchen.

01:09:02.346 --> 01:09:04.691
- She says I get in the way.
- We like having you here.

01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:06.066
- Don't we?
- Yes!

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:07.602
I'm having great fun, but...

01:09:07.769 --> 01:09:09.270
...I've really
got to go shopping.

01:09:09.437 --> 01:09:11.109
- Here.
- Daddy's being silly!

01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:14.446
- He is! He can't go like that.
- Like what?

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:16.577
That shirt needs a sponge.
It'll take me two secs.

01:09:16.736 --> 01:09:18.238
- Come on, off with it.
- Are you sure?

01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:19.576
- Mm-hm.
- Oh.

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:25.294
We can't let Daddy go looking all gooey, can we?

01:09:25.453 --> 01:09:28.877
"Oh, oh, oh, oh! We can't
let Daddy go looking all gooey."

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:31.667
"No, we have to
sponge him down first."

01:09:41.719 --> 01:09:44.939
- Nice tatts.
- Great back.

01:09:45.098 --> 01:09:47.942
You should see his bottom.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.944
We have.

01:09:50.103 --> 01:09:52.856
This is somebody's husband!
It's someone's private life.

That's what makes it so good!

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:57.364
I'm gonna tell him.
I'm gonna tell James.

01:09:57.527 --> 01:09:59.450
He's got a right to know he's being watched.

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:02.911
Oh.

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:17.346

01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:30.573
...in the limousine.

01:13:34.702 --> 01:13:38.582
- Scary.
- I heard that!

01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:41.963
Oh!

01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:45.426
It seems just a blink ago
I was sentenced to kitchen duties

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:47.556
for the term of my natural life, and then...

01:13:47.715 --> 01:13:51.094
...you spotted me.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:54.389
And now I'm off for...
How long is this tour thing?

01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:58.435
Oh... Uh, best guesstimate?
Let's see. Uh...

01:13:58.601 --> 01:14:00.979
- Three months-ish.
- Three?!

01:14:01.145 --> 01:14:04.570
Well, I'll have to get
a full-time nanny.

01:14:04.732 --> 01:14:06.575
Yay! A full-time nanny!

01:14:06.734 --> 01:14:08.236

01:14:08.402 --> 01:14:10.530
- Whoo!
- Hooray!

01:14:10.696 --> 01:14:13.620
And then I can just take them
from hotel to hotel with me.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.077
Sure.

01:14:16.243 --> 01:14:19.372
Or you could just...
leave them at home.

01:14:19.538 --> 01:14:23.509

for three months.

initial there and sign there.

- Sorry.

01:17:54.461 --> 01:17:56.384
I was just watching my family.

01:17:56.547 --> 01:17:58.845
Oh.

01:17:59.008 --> 01:18:03.058
You're gonna be fine.
James is doing a great job.

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:05.222
Yeah. He...

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:06.766
How do you know?

01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:08.309
I've been watching too.

01:18:08.475 --> 01:18:09.852
Everybody can see it.

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:12.488
It is on your website.

01:18:12.646 --> 01:18:14.114
Huh?

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:18.323
You... You...

01:18:25.576 --> 01:18:29.080
You just switch from the Sydney
web cam to the Hobart web cam.

01:18:29.246 --> 01:18:31.169
You know that.

01:18:31.332 --> 01:18:33.926
- Bollocks.
- How could you not know that?

01:18:34.084 --> 01:18:36.633
- Can you show me how you...
- What are you so panicked about?

01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:38.672
I haven't even told him about the web cam.

01:18:38.839 --> 01:18:40.716
I mean, about me doing the web cam thing,

01:18:40.883 --> 01:18:43.136
let alone the fact that he and the kids are now...

01:18:43.302 --> 01:18:45.725
Oh, how could I?
How could you?

01:18:45.888 --> 01:18:48.437
I... I thought you knew.
I'm sorry.

01:18:48.599 --> 01:18:50.101
I'm such an idiot!

01:18:50.267 --> 01:18:52.395
If I'd just...
Who's done all this artwork?

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:55.986
They... We...
We thought you'd be pleased.

01:18:58.484 --> 01:19:01.033
Alright.
Well, I think it's ready.

01:19:01.195 --> 01:19:03.243
Oh, there you are.

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:07.285
- Can you please go?
- I need the contract.

01:19:10.996 --> 01:19:14.170
I'm starved.
Thank you.

01:19:14.333 --> 01:19:16.301
Um...

01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:20.389
You've just... missed one.
Just there.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:26.808
Thanks.

01:19:30.224 --> 01:19:32.352
Pick you up from the lobby in the morning, then.

01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:46.581
Oh...

01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:48.663
- You're very tense.
- Yeah.

01:19:48.826 --> 01:19:52.126
You worry about things, don't you?

01:19:53.205 --> 01:19:55.708
Oh. Oh...

01:19:55.874 --> 01:19:58.127
- Is that OK?
- Yeah. Yeah, right there.

01:20:13.517 --> 01:20:15.611
Oh, God, yes. Oh...

01:20:15.769 --> 01:20:17.487
Where's Fizz?

01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:20.616
Oh. Right there.

01:20:20.774 --> 01:20:22.947
Oh...

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:26.534
- I'm gonna get going.
- Yeah.

01:20:26.697 --> 01:20:29.246
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Um... Oh. Pantry.

01:20:29.408 --> 01:20:31.331
Um, are you feeling better?

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:33.916
Yeah. Good. Alright.
Well, I'll see you... Oh!

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:35.581
I'm sorry.
I'll see you later.

01:20:35.748 --> 01:20:38.171
Oh. Bag.

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:41.178
Cherry, you've been great.
Thanks very much.

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:43.214
Oh. No worries.

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:46.930
Sorry. 'Bye! See you later.

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:56.193
- Hello?
- James!

01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:58.070
I've got something really big to tell you

01:20:58.228 --> 01:21:00.026
and you're not gonna like it.

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:01.611
Oh, God. What?

01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:05.574
See the plant on the shelf in the middle of the window?

01:21:05.736 --> 01:21:07.784
Hang on one second.

01:21:07.946 --> 01:21:10.495
- It's the babysitter. Coming!
- James.

01:21:10.657 --> 01:21:13.126
James!

01:21:13.285 --> 01:21:14.753
There's a web cam hidden in your kitchen

01:21:14.912 --> 01:21:16.539
and everybody's watching you on the internet.

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:17.752
What?!

01:21:17.915 --> 01:21:19.337
There's a web cam in your kitchen.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.094
I have to go.
They're coming.

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:40.021
James!
James! James!

01:21:40.187 --> 01:21:42.064
James!

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:50.785
Bugger

01:21:54.952 --> 01:21:56.704
I'm so sorry, Cassandra.

01:21:56.870 --> 01:22:00.124
- I can't come. I'm not coming.
- This is just nerves...

01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:02.088
I don't want to be the next big thing.

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:03.628
Stop. Let's just
get in the car...

01:22:03.794 --> 01:22:05.967
All this time, I have been blaming James and the kids

01:22:06.130 --> 01:22:07.507
for making me a nobody.

01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:10.426
But it's them that have turned me into somebody.

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:14.313
No-one is asking you
to leave your family behind.

01:22:14.471 --> 01:22:16.394
Don't you see?
That's exactly what will happen.

01:22:16.557 --> 01:22:18.605
Three months this time.

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:21.316
- Longer next time, until...
- Get her bags.

01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:25.108
No, Cassandra.
I'm not coming.

01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:28.403
You signed a legally binding contract.

01:22:28.569 --> 01:22:31.493
Actually, she didn't.

01:22:31.655 --> 01:22:34.499
I went to pick up the contract last night

01:22:34.658 --> 01:22:36.251
and she hadn't signed it.

01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:40.005
She... said that she was gonna
bring it this morning,

01:22:40.164 --> 01:22:43.384
but she's obviously...
ripped it up... or something.

01:22:43.542 --> 01:22:47.092
That's right.
There is no contract.

01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:49.882
Idiot.

01:22:55.929 --> 01:22:59.900
Women like me spend years doing the hard yards,

01:23:00.058 --> 01:23:01.935
creating opportunities for girls like you.

01:23:02.102 --> 01:23:04.230
And what do you do?

01:23:04.396 --> 01:23:06.114
You nancy about with all of this vague,

01:23:06.273 --> 01:23:08.321
feel-goody,
New Agey crap

01:23:08.484 --> 01:23:10.907
and piss it all away!

01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:13.492
Well, if it means ditching my husband

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:15.783
so that I can break through the <i>glass</i> ceiling, yeah.

01:23:15.949 --> 01:23:17.872
I choose to piss it all away.

01:23:22.581 --> 01:23:27.428
Don't you presume to know anything about me.

01:23:27.586 --> 01:23:30.931
I didn't ditch my husband.

01:23:31.089 --> 01:23:33.558
He left me because I couldn't have children.

01:23:33.717 --> 01:23:36.015
And guess why I don't tell that story to anyone.

01:23:36.178 --> 01:23:37.805
I didn't...

01:23:37.971 --> 01:23:42.147
Because that story makes me a sad, lonely loser.

01:23:42.309 --> 01:23:45.188
So forgive me if I spin the story

01:23:45.354 --> 01:23:48.574
in a way that seems superficial to you, Elspeth,

01:23:48.732 --> 01:23:51.451
but that is not how I see myself.

01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:54.284
That is not who I am.

01:23:54.446 --> 01:23:56.824
I am Cassandra Wolfe.

01:23:56.990 --> 01:24:01.746
I run the most successful agency
in the Asia-Pacific.

01:24:01.912 --> 01:24:05.132
And I am fabulous!

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:09.336
You are fabulous, Cassandra.

01:24:11.964 --> 01:24:14.308
Good bye.

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:15.763
Thank you.

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.557
Come on.

01:24:24.851 --> 01:24:29.732
- I have an idea.
- Don't speak just now.

01:24:55.173 --> 01:24:58.518
Hello! Mummy's home!

01:25:02.139 --> 01:25:03.766
Where's my bubbies?

01:25:25.871 --> 01:25:29.216
- Hiya, bubbies!
- Again, again!

01:25:29.374 --> 01:25:32.127
- Look! Mummy's here.
- My turn! Again!

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:34.467
- More, more!
- More, more!

01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:36.928
More, more!

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:39.267
Hi.

01:25:39.426 --> 01:25:41.645
My turn again!

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:43.396
He's not wearing any wings.

01:25:43.555 --> 01:25:46.650
Oh, yeah. I...
I just suggested it, and...

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:48.481
I hope you don't mind.
I just...

01:25:48.644 --> 01:25:50.396
We just thought we'd save them for special days.

01:25:50.562 --> 01:25:53.566
- Is that alright?
- Of course.

01:25:54.608 --> 01:25:56.952
Where's their father?

01:26:03.867 --> 01:26:06.666
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:09.957
I know you're angry with me.
I know why.

01:26:11.083 --> 01:26:12.801
I had no choice.

01:26:12.959 --> 01:26:15.712
That's it?
That's the apology?

01:26:15.879 --> 01:26:19.383
I was desperate for some sort of contact.

01:26:19.549 --> 01:26:21.472
So that makes it OK to expose our kids

01:26:21.635 --> 01:26:23.763
to every perv and weirdo who decided to log on?

01:26:23.929 --> 01:26:25.931
No, that was a mistake -
I left the web cam on

01:26:26.098 --> 01:26:27.850
to keep an eye on the nanny, that's all.

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:30.235
As soon as I knew everyone was watching, I called you.

01:26:30.394 --> 01:26:31.611
- Who's the bloke?
- What bloke'?

01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:33.363
Oh, come on, Elspeth.
Don't do this.

01:26:33.522 --> 01:26:36.241
- Rory? He's just a friend.
- Not Rory, Neil.

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.902
- Who's Rory?
- Neil?

01:26:38.068 --> 01:26:39.661
Yeah, Neil, who sent you perfume.

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:41.197
Neil sent me perfume?

01:26:41.363 --> 01:26:43.991
Oh, well...
He's just a boy, Jimmy.

01:26:44.157 --> 01:26:45.409
He helped me install the web cam.

01:26:45.575 --> 01:26:47.043
Why would he send you perfume?

01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:49.751
Because I smell?
I don't know.

01:26:49.913 --> 01:26:51.631
So who's this Rory?

01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:53.258
Nobody.

01:26:53.417 --> 01:26:55.636
I'm sorry everyone got to watch you,

01:26:55.794 --> 01:26:57.796
but I'm not sorry that I got to watch you,

01:26:57.963 --> 01:26:59.510
because I fell in love with you.

01:26:59.673 --> 01:27:01.926
I didn't even know I'd fallen out of love with you

01:27:02.092 --> 01:27:03.639
until I fell in love with you again,

01:27:03.802 --> 01:27:05.349
but that's what happened, Jimmy.

01:27:05.512 --> 01:27:07.139
I love you.

01:27:08.849 --> 01:27:11.693
James!

01:27:18.483 --> 01:27:20.986
How do I know you won't fall out of love with me again?

01:27:21.153 --> 01:27:23.326
I won't.

01:27:27.451 --> 01:27:29.044
I won't!

I loved your show.

01:31:41.788 --> 01:31:43.415

It's a humpback.

Nobody knows exactly why he's doing it.

01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:48.957
I think it's 'cause he's lost his mate.

01:33:49.124 --> 01:33:51.923
I think he's trying to find his way back to her.

01:33:52.085 --> 01:33:54.133
And nothing's gonna stop him

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:56.764

to him.
