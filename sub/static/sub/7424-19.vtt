WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:03.135
<i>From the moment we met...
We knew our lives</i>

00:03.137 --> 00:04.336
<i>Would never be the same.</i>

00:04.338 --> 00:05.671
<i>He saved my life.</i>

00:05.673 --> 00:07.039
<i>And she saved mine.</i>

00:07.041 --> 00:08.407
<i>We're destined.</i>

00:08.409 --> 00:11.310
<i>But we know it won't be easy.</i>

00:11.312 --> 00:14.646
<i>Even though we have
every reason to stay apart...</i>

00:14.648 --> 00:16.114
<i>We'll risk it all
to be together.</i>

00:16.117 --> 00:18.050
I am so in
love with you.

00:20.453 --> 00:24.023
What he is is a danger to
you and everyone around you.

00:24.025 --> 00:25.657
Evan, what did you do?

00:25.659 --> 00:28.093
<i>I called muirfield.</i>

00:30.097 --> 00:31.497
I was just trying
to protect you.

00:31.499 --> 00:34.166
I- I thought that
vincent was a threat.

00:34.168 --> 00:35.634
They lied to me.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.369
They said they were trying
to tie up loose ends.

00:37.371 --> 00:40.239
You and catherine are
those loose ends.

00:40.241 --> 00:43.509
<i>If I can help you and him
get out of here alive,</i>

00:43.511 --> 00:45.277
<i>It will be the best thing
that I've ever done in my life.</i>

00:45.279 --> 00:46.445
Evan, no!

00:51.251 --> 00:53.152
I received a confession
from Evan.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.820
He said that
he'd been covering

00:54.822 --> 00:56.255
For the vigilante
this whole time.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.389
He took the blame.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.791
He is to blame.

00:58.793 --> 01:02.428
# you are the one for me, boy

01:02.430 --> 01:04.530
# you give me butterflies
from my head #

01:04.532 --> 01:05.764
# to my feet and...

01:05.766 --> 01:08.133
As you
can see, mr. Keller,

01:08.135 --> 01:11.270
It is a bit of
a fixer-upper,

01:11.272 --> 01:12.738
But it has potential.

01:12.740 --> 01:15.507
It's quiet, there
are no shared walls,

01:15.509 --> 01:18.343
And the neighborhood
is very peaceful.

01:18.345 --> 01:20.245
And the previous owners?

01:20.247 --> 01:22.214
Arms dealers.
Uh-huh.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.550
They had to leave
rather suddenly.

01:24.552 --> 01:27.419
But they never had any
complaints about the building.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.588
It's easily defendable.

01:29.590 --> 01:33.425
And there is ample space
for entertaining.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.562
Do you host many
dinner parties?

01:36.564 --> 01:38.664
Not as many
as I'd like to.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.769
I don't know--
it's just...

01:43.771 --> 01:45.370
I was kind of hoping

01:45.372 --> 01:48.140
For someplace
a little more, uh...

01:48.142 --> 01:49.641
Romantic?

01:49.643 --> 01:52.377
You know, someplace
where my girlfriend

01:52.379 --> 01:54.546
Would actually come
and visit me.

01:54.548 --> 01:57.649
Trust me, your girlfriend
will visit you

01:57.651 --> 01:59.551
Wherever you live.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.620
Huh.

02:10.463 --> 02:11.763
Hey.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.465
I know you must be
still hurting

02:13.467 --> 02:15.400
About Evan, and this...

02:15.402 --> 02:17.236
This can't be easy
for you right now.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.872
I just wish I hadn't
encouraged him.

02:19.874 --> 02:23.742
If he hadn't been looking
at the vigilante crimes

02:23.744 --> 02:25.511
Or the cross-species dna,

02:25.513 --> 02:28.247
Muirfield never, never
would have found him.

02:28.249 --> 02:31.583
Catherine, you know
this isn't your fault, right?

02:31.585 --> 02:33.652
It might not be my fault,
but I can't let

02:33.654 --> 02:35.521
This happen to anyone else.

02:36.356 --> 02:38.757
I want you to be safe.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.926
Hey, I've been safe
for the past ten years.

02:40.928 --> 02:44.229
I think it's time for me
to move past it.

02:44.231 --> 02:45.664
We'll figure out
what to do

02:45.666 --> 02:47.399
With muirfield.

02:47.401 --> 02:50.869
I just... I don't want us
to start our new life

02:50.871 --> 02:54.273
In a place that feels
like we're locked in a prison.

02:54.275 --> 02:57.676
I want a place for us.

03:00.213 --> 03:02.848
That would be nice,
wouldn't it?

03:02.850 --> 03:04.917
Yeah.

03:32.912 --> 03:34.846
Lieutenant, you have
a good reason

03:34.848 --> 03:36.715
For bothering me at my home
at this hour?

03:36.717 --> 03:38.717
I want to redirect the efforts
of the task force.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.786
Vigilante's dead--
there is no more task force.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.287
He's dead, but the man
who confessed

03:42.289 --> 03:43.522
To helping him is
still at large.

03:43.524 --> 03:44.957
Evan marks.

03:44.959 --> 03:46.625
You're talking
about his e-mail, I assume.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.560
He's a traitor
under my own damn roof.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.396
Have you given even a moment's
thought to the implications

03:51.398 --> 03:52.931
Of opening
an investigation on marks?

03:52.933 --> 03:54.766
Yes...

03:54.768 --> 03:56.335
Every trial that used
evidence he collected,

03:56.337 --> 03:57.703
Every time he testified
in court--

03:57.705 --> 03:59.438
All of that would be called
into question.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.273
So what are you saying?

04:01.275 --> 04:03.308
We should just let him
get away with this?

04:03.310 --> 04:04.676
Your precinct's closure rate
would go from the best

04:04.678 --> 04:06.645
In the city to the worst
in the blink of an eye.

04:06.647 --> 04:07.646
That what you want?

04:07.648 --> 04:08.981
What I want is for him

04:08.983 --> 04:10.916
To have to answer
for what he did:

04:10.918 --> 04:12.784
Helping that psycho
who killed my brother.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.420
Joe, I get it.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.954
You want revenge,
and believe me,

04:16.957 --> 04:18.557
I am right there with you.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.425
I have people looking
into his whereabouts.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.692
Quietly.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.729
There is a way to handle
this without undoing

04:23.731 --> 04:25.264
Everything you've
accomplished,

04:25.266 --> 04:27.966
But you have to forget
about Evan Marks.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.003
Just for now.

04:40.546 --> 04:42.447
Is he gonna
be a problem?

04:42.449 --> 04:44.883
I'll keep an eye on him.

04:44.885 --> 04:47.286
I shouldn't have used
the task force

04:47.288 --> 04:48.353
To go after him.

04:48.355 --> 04:49.354
It's far too public.

04:49.356 --> 04:51.823
Too many loose ends.

04:51.825 --> 04:54.026
Clearly, we have
to find him ourselves.

04:54.028 --> 04:56.728
You had nightmares
again last night.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.431
Were they about him?

04:59.433 --> 05:01.767
Just running out of time.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.902
I have to find muirfield.

05:13.613 --> 05:16.315
Don't forget, I have
just as much reason

05:16.317 --> 05:17.916
To hate them as you do.

05:44.811 --> 05:47.746
Uh-oh, I know
that face.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.748
You okay?

05:49.750 --> 05:51.450
Vincent and I went
to Evan's apartment.

05:51.452 --> 05:54.119
We were looking
for his journals.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.987
That must have been hard.

05:55.989 --> 06:00.025
I still can't believe he's gone.

06:01.994 --> 06:05.797
He had this photo
of us from my birthday.

06:08.067 --> 06:09.935
Doesn't get
any easier, does it?

06:09.937 --> 06:11.603
Losing people?

06:11.605 --> 06:13.605
No.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.407
Never does.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.078
Did you find anything?
Um...

06:20.080 --> 06:21.079
No.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.147
The place was tossed.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.749
Someone got there before us.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.784
Someone-- are you
thinking muirfield?

06:25.786 --> 06:27.819
Can you think of anyone else
who would want

06:27.821 --> 06:30.689
To find Evan's
extracurricular research?

06:30.691 --> 06:32.491
Not really, but, uh,

06:32.493 --> 06:36.161
Joe still seems bent
on tracking Evan down.

06:36.163 --> 06:38.029
But I don't think he'd
search his apartment

06:38.031 --> 06:40.465
Without a warrant.
Right.

06:40.467 --> 06:41.933
I just feel really
guilty knowing the truth

06:41.935 --> 06:44.002
About Evan and monster man
and not telling him.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.437
You can't--
you know that, right?

06:45.439 --> 06:46.938
Yeah.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.541
And his name is vincent.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.176
Lame, boring.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.445
Fine.

06:53.447 --> 06:54.846
How is vincent?

06:54.848 --> 06:57.649
Him and jt are still trying
to find a place to live.

06:57.651 --> 07:01.520
He says he wants to find
somewhere that's safe.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.054
For us.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.823
"us"-- that's sweet.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.425
And, uh, unfamiliar.

07:06.427 --> 07:07.526
There is

07:07.528 --> 07:08.927
No place that's gonna be safe

07:08.929 --> 07:10.429
As long as muirfield's
out there.

07:10.431 --> 07:11.763
Not for him.

07:12.965 --> 07:14.866
Muirfield?

07:14.868 --> 07:18.737
They won't stop until
they have caught and killed him.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.138
No, no, no,
don't go in!

07:20.140 --> 07:21.139
You can't go in there!

07:21.141 --> 07:22.941
No, no, no, don't, sir!

07:22.943 --> 07:24.075
We need to get you
medical attention.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.544
Sir.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.878
Detective chandler.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.150
That's close enough.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.485
No, no.

07:42.595 --> 07:44.463
What's your name?

07:48.167 --> 07:50.936
You don't have much time.

07:50.938 --> 07:53.638
What do you mean?

08:00.179 --> 08:02.814
He's dead.

08:29.075 --> 08:31.610
Why would a man that I have
never seen before

08:31.612 --> 08:33.178
Stagger in here all shot up
trying to find me?

08:33.179 --> 08:35.746
You think it might
be muirfield?

08:35.749 --> 08:38.650
If that's the case,
how did he find you?

08:38.652 --> 08:40.585
That's what I'm worried about.

08:40.587 --> 08:42.020
Here.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.858
I took it off the body
in the confusion.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.728
I can't believe that
you are concealing evidence.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.663
I have completely corrupted you.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.765
Let's just find out
if the guy's some kind of agent

08:53.767 --> 08:56.067
From you-know-what,
and then we'll turn it in.

08:58.571 --> 09:02.007
So weird seeing
someone else doing Evan's job.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.909
Hey, uh, new guy?

09:03.911 --> 09:05.277
It's iverson.

09:05.279 --> 09:06.211
Kirk.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.612
Sorry. I'm tess...

09:07.614 --> 09:09.848
Vargas, and
that's chandler.

09:09.850 --> 09:10.882
I did my homework.

09:10.884 --> 09:11.883
That's great.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.151
Now can you do your job

09:13.153 --> 09:14.719
And give us something
to work with?

09:14.721 --> 09:17.756
He's got no I.D. On him.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.759
No wallet, no
keys, no money.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.160
He was shot five times.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.662
Looks like a.38,
but I'll know for sure

09:23.664 --> 09:25.196
When I get him
down to the lab.

09:25.198 --> 09:28.867
He also has extensive bruising
on his face and hands.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.735
This guy fought
like hell.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.237
Not all this
blood is his.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.905
I don't get it, chandler.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.941
You have no idea why
an armed man who was

09:35.943 --> 09:37.842
Shot to hell barged in here
looking for you?

09:37.844 --> 09:39.277
Completely at a loss.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.212
I have no idea
who this guy is.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.781
Have you I.D.'d him yet?

09:42.783 --> 09:46.718
Assistant district
attorney lowan.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.753
I thought you washed
your hands of us.

09:48.755 --> 09:52.357
I was in a meeting nearby, and I
heard you had some excitement.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.059
Is it true you knew him?

09:54.061 --> 09:55.327
My detective never

09:55.329 --> 09:56.661
Saw him before.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.832
Okay, this just got
pretty interesting.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.836
He's got no fingerprints.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.705
It's completely smooth.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.840
Guy went to a lot of
trouble to make sure

10:08.842 --> 10:10.875
He couldn't be identified.

10:18.217 --> 10:22.354
You see, you draw a face,
and he's a dinosaur.

10:22.356 --> 10:23.822
Mine is different.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.091
It has little lines all over it.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.826
Well, those are your
fingerprints, sweetheart.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.661
Yours is better.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.896
No lines, no fingerprints.

10:35.101 --> 10:36.301
Come on.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.703
It's time
for your session.

10:55.187 --> 10:57.422
Lieutenant, I'm gonna
get out of your hair,

10:57.424 --> 10:59.357
But could you keep me
informed on the progress

10:59.359 --> 11:01.059
Of this investigation?

11:01.061 --> 11:03.261
Just as a courtesy.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.363
Incident like this
in a precinct in my district--

11:05.365 --> 11:07.365
I like to be kept in the loop.

11:09.769 --> 11:11.670
Are you sure you've
never seen him?

11:11.672 --> 11:13.672
I'm sure.

11:29.789 --> 11:32.190
So, you lied to cat?

11:32.192 --> 11:34.259
I didn't lie to her.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.227
I just...

11:36.229 --> 11:39.464
I said she needs to keep as
far away from anything related

11:39.466 --> 11:40.765
To muirfield
as possible.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.167
Good.
However,

11:42.169 --> 11:44.269
I didn't tell her
that I was gonna look

11:44.271 --> 11:46.838
Into this guy and try
and find out where he came from.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.139
I'm trying to
keep her safe.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.075
That's a slippery slope,
my friend.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.409
Are you sure
this is it?

11:51.411 --> 11:53.144
Yeah, I'm sure.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.080
He bled all the
way from here

11:55.082 --> 11:57.315
To the precinct.

11:57.317 --> 12:01.019
Easiest scent to follow.

12:01.021 --> 12:04.089
All I can smell is
rancid cooking oil and despair.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.058
Go check out that car.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.471
The ignition's on.

12:19.473 --> 12:21.473
Must have sat here running

12:21.475 --> 12:24.275
Until it was out of gas.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.244
Why would
he abandon it?

12:26.246 --> 12:28.847
It wasn't him.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.248
Different footprints.

12:32.952 --> 12:35.053
He came from that
end of the alley,

12:35.055 --> 12:36.421
Got cut off by the car.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.789
Driver jumped out,

12:37.791 --> 12:39.124
Left the car running,

12:39.126 --> 12:40.492
They fought?
Yeah.

12:40.494 --> 12:42.193
They were both wounded.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.863
He ran off that way

12:44.865 --> 12:47.866
And made it into the
precinct before he bled out.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.534
So what happened to the driver?

12:51.138 --> 12:53.204
What?

13:00.981 --> 13:02.914
No, you don't want
to see this.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.182
Oh, that's nasty.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.251
Told you not to look.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.060
No fingerprints.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.529
Like smooth or like eaten?

13:17.531 --> 13:19.397
Like smooth.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.466
This whole thing
screams muirfield.

13:24.003 --> 13:25.937
You okay?

13:25.939 --> 13:28.173
Yeah, I'll-I'll live.

13:33.012 --> 13:34.879
Hey, check this out.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.819
Looks like someone was
in the middle

13:40.821 --> 13:42.587
Of recording a video
when this happened.

13:42.589 --> 13:45.824
The-the display
is completely destroyed.

13:45.826 --> 13:48.426
Okay, well, see if you
can get anything off it.

13:48.428 --> 13:52.030
If there's a video on
there, we need to see it.

13:52.032 --> 13:55.333
You know, if this was
muirfield and they found cat,

13:55.335 --> 13:59.103
It's not gonna be long
before more of them come.

13:59.105 --> 14:00.939
Hey.
Hey.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.106
What was so urgent?

14:02.108 --> 14:03.374
You've found something
on the vic?

14:03.376 --> 14:04.876
Still no clue
where he came from,

14:04.878 --> 14:06.211
But I think I found
something better.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.212
This is security footage

14:07.214 --> 14:08.313
From the antique store

14:08.315 --> 14:09.881
Outside Evan's apartment.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.516
I thought we could catch
whoever took his files

14:11.518 --> 14:13.318
On camera. Watch.

14:16.055 --> 14:18.256
Hello, muirfield.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.604
Hey, handsome, can you
run a plate for me?

14:32.606 --> 14:35.273
Boy john tom mary 17252.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.608
Thanks.

14:36.610 --> 14:38.476
"handsome"?
Not really.

14:38.478 --> 14:41.412
Great, whose car is it?

14:43.649 --> 14:45.917
Thanks.

14:47.653 --> 14:49.954
Gabriel lowan.

14:49.956 --> 14:51.623
Are you kidding?

14:51.625 --> 14:53.558
Do you think he had
the apartment searched

14:53.560 --> 14:55.093
In an official capacity?

14:55.095 --> 14:57.462
This does not look official.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.330
Cat, do you think
the assistant district attorney

14:59.332 --> 15:00.665
Is working for muirfield?

15:12.544 --> 15:14.379
Detective.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.381
Come to give me an update
on our mysterious intruder?

15:16.383 --> 15:19.250
I came to find out
why you had the research

15:19.252 --> 15:20.451
From Evan's apartment removed.

15:20.453 --> 15:21.953
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.187
I have a video

15:23.189 --> 15:25.156
Of a man handing you
that research

15:25.158 --> 15:28.359
That says you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.328
You got me.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.629
I had Evan's computer

15:31.631 --> 15:34.065
And journals confiscated

15:34.067 --> 15:36.034
In order to prevent
your lieutenant

15:36.036 --> 15:37.535
From pursuing a course of action

15:37.537 --> 15:39.203
That would lead
to a legal nightmare

15:39.205 --> 15:40.638
Of epic proportions.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.240
So you're not concerned
that Evan's gonna

15:42.242 --> 15:46.144
It's very clear from what
he wrote in his journals

15:46.146 --> 15:48.546
That he was never
helping the vigilante.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.148
Quite the
opposite, in fact.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.317
He was helping another
outside organization

15:52.319 --> 15:54.285
Track the
vigilante down.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.022
But I think
you already knew that.

15:58.024 --> 16:00.191
I have my suspicions,

16:00.193 --> 16:02.327
And I think a man like you,

16:02.329 --> 16:04.295
Highly placed in local politics,

16:04.297 --> 16:07.665
Is exactly the kind of man
that an organization like that

16:07.667 --> 16:09.233
Would want on their side.

16:09.235 --> 16:11.602
You think I'm working
for muirfield?

16:16.041 --> 16:19.310
Maybe you should sit down.

16:26.618 --> 16:28.453
Very few people
have ever heard

16:28.455 --> 16:30.455
What I'm about to tell
you, detective chandler.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.661
When I was very young,

16:36.663 --> 16:38.496
<i>Maybe four or five...</i>

16:40.734 --> 16:45.069
<i>...I was orphaned and alone.</i>

16:45.071 --> 16:47.005
<i>I was picked up off the streets
of calcutta</i>

16:47.007 --> 16:49.207
<i>And brought to america.</i>

16:51.076 --> 16:52.744
Any change?

16:55.080 --> 16:57.415
Chimera five, stable.

16:57.417 --> 17:00.251
<i>I was housed and fed,</i>

17:00.253 --> 17:02.220
On the whole,
very well cared for,

17:02.222 --> 17:04.122
If you don't count
the never-ending series

17:04.124 --> 17:05.623
Of medical procedures.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.059
So you were
some kind of guinea pig?

17:08.060 --> 17:12.262
Continually being harvested
for blood and tissue

17:12.265 --> 17:14.298
And anything else
they could take from me.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.502
So you see, detective,

17:17.503 --> 17:19.270
I'm not working for muirfield.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.071
I have been hunting them

17:21.074 --> 17:22.607
For most of my life.

17:22.608 --> 17:25.576
I'm sorry
for what happened to you,

17:25.578 --> 17:29.313
But I only came here to find out
why you took Evan's research.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.551
Trust has to be earned.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.319
So I will lay all my cards

17:35.321 --> 17:37.055
On the table.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.289
I've read Evan's journals.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.191
I know that you and he
were looking

17:40.193 --> 17:42.326
Into cross-species dna found
at various crime scenes,

17:42.328 --> 17:44.395
And that you
had discovered

17:44.397 --> 17:47.665
That the vigilante was, in fact,
a human-animal hybrid.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.635
Which led you to muirfield.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.804
I know that Evan,
behind your back,

17:52.806 --> 17:54.739
Started working with them,
and I'm assuming

17:54.741 --> 17:57.575
When they were finished
with him, they had him killed.

17:59.445 --> 18:01.379
I'm guessing that he e-mailed
his confession

18:01.381 --> 18:04.248
In order to cover up your
involvement in this whole thing,

18:04.250 --> 18:06.217
And now
you're hunting muirfield,

18:06.219 --> 18:08.453
Hoping to take them down
for what they did to him.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.188
How am I doing so far?

18:10.190 --> 18:13.324
So far, you haven't said
anything that makes me think

18:13.326 --> 18:15.660
You're anything but
a muirfield agent yourself.

18:15.662 --> 18:18.262
Catherine, you and I are
on the same side here.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.231
I want revenge on muirfield,

18:20.233 --> 18:22.100
To expose them
for what they really are,

18:22.102 --> 18:24.168
Not just for me,
but for all the other victims--

18:24.170 --> 18:25.636
For Evan,

18:25.638 --> 18:27.238
And even for the man who died

18:27.240 --> 18:28.539
In that warehouse,
the vigilante.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.242
So why the task force
to catch him?

18:31.244 --> 18:33.211
To protect him.

18:33.213 --> 18:36.180
Don't forget, I did specify
that he was to be taken alive.

18:36.182 --> 18:39.383
And I'll admit, I hoped that
he could lead me to muirfield.

18:39.385 --> 18:41.819
I still don't know
what you want with me.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.254
You're a cop.

18:43.256 --> 18:46.357
My position can open
certain doors,

18:46.359 --> 18:50.561
But you can do things
and go places that I can't,

18:50.563 --> 18:53.431
And I think you might
know things that I don't.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.666
You were right.

18:55.668 --> 18:59.270
Trust has to be earned.

18:59.272 --> 19:02.740
I don't think we're there yet.

19:10.182 --> 19:11.749
<i>Detective chandler,</i>

19:11.751 --> 19:13.451
My name is paul davis.

19:13.453 --> 19:14.852
Your mother was my mentor

19:14.854 --> 19:16.754
When I first started working
for muirfield.

19:16.756 --> 19:19.190
I always had my suspicions
about what happened to her,

19:19.192 --> 19:20.725
But I never said anything,
and for that,

19:20.727 --> 19:22.293
I'm truly sorry.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.262
I don't think anyone else knows

19:24.264 --> 19:26.864
About you yet,
but that's not gonna last.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.267
You have to be careful.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.701
Because muirfield had
to move their operation,

19:30.703 --> 19:32.603
They're vulnerable
for the moment.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.807
I can lead you
to everything you need

19:36.809 --> 19:38.209
To expose them.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.279
Go to the orchard!

19:41.281 --> 19:43.948
We have to get busy.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.816
We don't know
how much time we have,

19:45.818 --> 19:48.519
And we have to figure out
where the orchard is,

19:48.521 --> 19:50.321
Or-or what it is.

19:50.323 --> 19:53.491
I bet this has something to do
with that, uh, swipe card

19:53.493 --> 19:54.792
That tess found.
Catherine,

19:54.794 --> 19:56.394
The reason I showed you
this video

19:56.396 --> 19:58.329
Is so you know
how much danger you're in.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.830
If this guy
could find you,

19:59.832 --> 20:01.666
Then anyone from muirfield
could be circling.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.901
Okay, and the last person
they circled ended up dead.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.870
This could be our chance
to expose muirfield

20:05.872 --> 20:07.338
And take them down for good.

20:07.340 --> 20:08.639
Or it could be a trap.

20:08.641 --> 20:09.807
So an agent

20:09.809 --> 20:11.409
Pretended to defect

20:11.411 --> 20:13.678
And-and let himself be killed
in order

20:13.680 --> 20:15.346
To lure me out?

20:15.348 --> 20:17.448
Seems like a pretty
elaborate trap,

20:17.450 --> 20:18.816
Don't you think?

20:18.818 --> 20:21.886
I wonder if gabe knows
what the orchard is.

20:21.888 --> 20:25.790
This gabe guy has given you
no reason to trust him.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.825
I mean, come on, not really.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.494
Anyone from muirfield
could've made that story up.

20:30.496 --> 20:32.263
You didn't
see his face.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.631
He's traumatized.

20:33.633 --> 20:36.567
Vincent, they did
horrible things to him.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.604
This is the first person
who knows about muirfield

20:39.606 --> 20:40.938
Who could
actually help us.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.974
And you trust him completely?

20:42.976 --> 20:44.442
Enough to
tell him about me,

20:44.444 --> 20:45.876
About us?

20:45.878 --> 20:48.279
Because if you do,
there's no going back.

20:48.281 --> 20:51.449
Everything changes.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.684
Catherine...

20:53.686 --> 20:56.754
All I'm asking is
that you stay away from him

20:56.756 --> 20:58.856
Until we check out his story.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.658
And the orchard?

21:00.660 --> 21:01.926
You want me

21:01.928 --> 21:04.328
To wait around while
you check that out, too?

21:04.330 --> 21:06.697
Catherine,
I couldn't handle losing you.

21:06.699 --> 21:08.566
All right, I couldn't live.

21:08.568 --> 21:09.967
I wouldn't want to.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.003
And I can't face every day

21:12.005 --> 21:14.739
Knowing that muirfield
is out there hunting you.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.340
You have this fantasy
that you're gonna find

21:16.342 --> 21:17.441
A new place to live

21:17.443 --> 21:19.410
And I'm gonna come visit you

21:19.412 --> 21:21.445
And we're gonna move on
with our lives,

21:21.447 --> 21:24.415
But that is never
going to happen

21:24.417 --> 21:26.984
As long as this threat
is hanging over our heads.

21:26.986 --> 21:29.520
Just give me the time
to work this out.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.458
Please.

21:48.940 --> 21:51.842
Okay, so I double-checked
the muirfield warehouse.

21:51.844 --> 21:54.679
Seems they've gone
back underground.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.447
You manage to find anything?

21:56.449 --> 21:58.449
I got nothing. I searched
every database I could think of.

21:58.451 --> 21:59.984
Nothing called the orchard?

21:59.986 --> 22:02.486
There's thousands of things
called the orchard:

22:02.488 --> 22:04.588
Bars, restaurants, shops,
actual orchards.

22:04.590 --> 22:06.057
But nothing
that would suggest

22:06.059 --> 22:07.558
Some kind of muirfield
involvement.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.794
And if I do
a more aggressive search,

22:09.796 --> 22:11.929
It's bound to raise red flags.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.798
Look again.
We need to figure this out

22:13.800 --> 22:15.066
Before catherine does, okay?

22:15.068 --> 22:16.734
Imagine what you two could
accomplish

22:16.736 --> 22:18.102
If you were
actually working together.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.937
Come on, man, that's not fair.

22:19.939 --> 22:22.907
I'm just trying to keep her
from ending up like Evan.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.108
If you're trying

22:24.110 --> 22:25.776
To protect her from all this,

22:25.778 --> 22:27.978
Do you think maybe,
when we find the new place,

22:27.980 --> 22:30.748
We should consider going back
to the old way of doing things?

22:30.750 --> 22:32.683
What, total secrecy?
Even from catherine?

22:32.685 --> 22:35.386
Yeah. And no more visiting
her apartment either.

22:35.388 --> 22:37.988
I hate that I even have
to think about this,

22:37.990 --> 22:41.726
But if it's the only way
to keep her safe...

22:41.728 --> 22:43.461
Yeah.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.096
Okay, so what do you want to do?

22:45.098 --> 22:46.697
Because I've exhausted
my options.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.132
If we can't figure out
the orchard thing,

22:48.134 --> 22:49.934
Then we should concentrate
on muirfield.

22:49.936 --> 22:52.503
Maybe we should check out
the one person who knows more

22:52.505 --> 22:54.772
About them than we do.

22:58.910 --> 23:00.478
Tess,

23:00.480 --> 23:01.412
I'm glad you're here.

23:01.414 --> 23:02.613
Look, um, walking

23:02.615 --> 23:05.483
On eggshells
is driving me crazy,

23:05.485 --> 23:07.051
So I'm just gonna come out
with it.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.919
I know you're still
investigating Evan

23:08.921 --> 23:11.021
Even though the da's office
warned you off.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.823
Look, I get it.

23:12.825 --> 23:15.126
Someone in your own department
betrayed you, and

23:15.128 --> 23:16.460
You want them to pay.

23:16.462 --> 23:19.497
No. What I want is for him

23:19.499 --> 23:21.999
To look me in my eyes
and tell me why.

23:22.001 --> 23:24.802
Why he was helping
the vigilante.

23:24.804 --> 23:28.172
Why my brother had to die.

23:28.174 --> 23:31.742
I will not stop until
I get those answers.

23:52.030 --> 23:53.431
You okay?

23:53.433 --> 23:55.065
I'm not talking about it.

23:55.067 --> 23:56.801
What is that?

23:56.803 --> 24:01.105
It's either a peace offering
or it's bait.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.040
It's one
of Evan's journals.

24:03.042 --> 24:05.609
Gabe must have left it on my
desk, trying to earn my trust.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.711
Is it working?

24:07.713 --> 24:11.782
My gut says yes,
but this voice in my head

24:11.784 --> 24:14.151
That sounds a lot like vincent
says no.

24:15.954 --> 24:18.055
What do you think?

24:18.057 --> 24:20.991
I think that your gut has saved
both our lives

24:20.993 --> 24:24.662
On more than one occasion.
I say listen to it.

24:24.664 --> 24:27.832
If the new ada wants to help you take down
these muirfield guys,

24:27.834 --> 24:30.234
Then more power to him.

24:30.236 --> 24:33.204
Vincent is gonna go ballistic.

24:33.206 --> 24:35.906
And for him,
that's kind of a big deal.

24:35.908 --> 24:38.609
Vincent will be fine.

24:38.611 --> 24:41.111
You and I both know
better than anyone

24:41.113 --> 24:43.214
That sometimes you have
to hide a little truth

24:43.216 --> 24:45.483
From your partner in order
to protect them.

24:50.222 --> 24:53.624
Have you gone through all this?

24:53.626 --> 24:54.859
Yeah. I thought

24:54.861 --> 24:56.126
You could
take a shot.

24:56.128 --> 24:59.497
Maybe you'll see
something I overlooked.

25:06.838 --> 25:08.105
Orchard industries?

25:08.107 --> 25:10.975
Does that mean
something to you?

25:10.977 --> 25:13.010
They won't stop
with Evan, you know.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.078
Muirfield will be looking
for anyone

25:14.080 --> 25:15.713
Who might have
helped him.

25:15.715 --> 25:16.914
I know what it's like
to always

25:16.916 --> 25:18.015
Be looking
over your shoulder.

25:18.017 --> 25:21.018
But imagine a life
free of that.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.987
We're off the record here,
right?

25:22.989 --> 25:24.822
Sure.

25:26.958 --> 25:29.627
The, uh, the dead guy
in the precinct.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.262
I lifted his phone
without telling anyone.

25:31.264 --> 25:35.032
He had a video. It was for me.

25:35.034 --> 25:38.102
He said that muirfield would be
vulnerable for a brief time

25:38.104 --> 25:40.304
And that I would find
everything I needed

25:40.306 --> 25:42.239
To take them down
at the orchard.

25:42.241 --> 25:45.142
Okay. If we're going
to do something about this,

25:45.144 --> 25:46.777
It has to be right now.

25:46.779 --> 25:49.113
No, I should go alone.
Do some recon, see what

25:49.115 --> 25:51.115
We're dealing with.
I'm coming with you.

25:51.117 --> 25:54.552
No. No, if we were seen,
it would be a lot harder

25:54.554 --> 25:56.887
To explain what you were
doing there.

26:03.828 --> 26:06.196
Gabe
Are you sure you can get in?

26:06.198 --> 26:09.166
It looks clear.
I'm gonna try and get closer.

26:09.168 --> 26:12.102
I'll check back in with
you in 15 minutes.

26:13.705 --> 26:16.106
So, why not bring gabe in?

26:16.108 --> 26:18.342
Because I have no clue what
I'm gonna find in there,

26:18.344 --> 26:19.910
And I can't risk it
being something

26:19.912 --> 26:21.712
That might expose vincent.

26:21.714 --> 26:24.081
You ready for this?

26:26.918 --> 26:29.153
Sir!

26:29.155 --> 26:30.354
Sir?

26:30.356 --> 26:32.656
Sir!

26:34.159 --> 26:37.695
Can you help me?
I'm crazy lost.

26:37.697 --> 26:40.230
Where were you trying to go?

26:40.232 --> 26:41.699
A warehouse party.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.801
And I may have
started partying

26:43.803 --> 26:45.869
A little too
early, so...

27:02.855 --> 27:05.089
Catherine? Everything all right?

27:05.091 --> 27:07.858
Yeah. So far all I've found
is a card reader

27:07.860 --> 27:09.259
Protecting a really
impressive door.

27:09.261 --> 27:12.129
I need you standing by
just in case.

27:22.674 --> 27:25.242
This must be what he meant
by vulnerable.

27:25.244 --> 27:27.344
What is it?
What do you see?

27:29.814 --> 27:31.782
Computer servers.
Lots of them.

27:31.784 --> 27:34.184
It's muirfield's brain.

27:43.862 --> 27:45.929
Okay. I hope you can talk me
through this.

27:46.731 --> 27:48.799
Don't worry.
We'll figure it out.

27:48.801 --> 27:50.367
Okay, here goes.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.336
It's asking for a password.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.038
Didn't the guy
in the video give you one?

27:54.040 --> 27:55.406
The guy on the video is dead.

27:55.408 --> 27:57.708
There wasn't anything
in Evan's files?

27:57.710 --> 27:59.376
Nothing.

27:59.378 --> 28:00.878
I can't believe
this is happening.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.913
Not when we are this close.

28:02.915 --> 28:06.984
Try "chimera."
c- h-I...

28:06.986 --> 28:09.720
I know how to spell it.

28:09.722 --> 28:11.689
Why did you pick that word?

28:11.691 --> 28:13.290
Just trust me. Type it in.

28:18.129 --> 28:20.731
It worked. We're in.

28:20.733 --> 28:23.767
Oh, my god, this is everything.

28:23.769 --> 28:25.369
Names, places.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.271
All their administrative files.

28:27.273 --> 28:29.306
I need to see
what you're seeing.

28:29.308 --> 28:31.075
Gabe, even if I had
a flash drive,

28:31.077 --> 28:32.810
It wouldn't hold a fraction
of this data.

28:32.812 --> 28:34.378
I can e-mail you some
of the files.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.747
No. We can download directly
to another server.

28:36.749 --> 28:38.916
It'll be faster.
I need you to go

28:38.918 --> 28:41.919
To the network connections menu,
upper right-hand corner,

28:41.921 --> 28:44.421
And type in this ip address:

28:44.423 --> 28:48.959
2-7-5-2-8-3-

28:48.961 --> 28:51.261
3-6-8-4-3-3.

28:52.964 --> 28:54.498
Done. Now what?

29:00.506 --> 29:03.273
It worked.
We got 'em.

29:04.275 --> 29:06.744
Okay, just give me a second

29:06.746 --> 29:08.912
And I will send you
the most important files.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.081
No. We can control
the download from here.

29:13.318 --> 29:15.819
No.

29:15.821 --> 29:17.354
We're gonna get everything.

29:22.994 --> 29:24.361
Keller.

29:30.034 --> 29:31.435
This is not good.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.437
Must have been
their backup site.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.072
This is a
lot of data.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.109
Everything all right?
So far.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.211
I'm shunting everything over
to the server

29:41.213 --> 29:43.147
At the mansion now.

29:46.818 --> 29:48.485
Whoa. She needs to make sure

29:48.487 --> 29:50.921
Nothing interrupts
this download.

29:50.923 --> 29:53.457
They have some pretty advanced
security measures.

29:53.459 --> 29:57.294
If it doesn't finish, then
all the files are corrupted.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.129
We would lose everything.

30:00.999 --> 30:03.934
Catherine, I need
you to make sure

30:03.936 --> 30:05.569
That nothing interrupts
this download.

30:05.571 --> 30:08.105
We could lose
everything.

30:08.107 --> 30:10.474
Jt, I need you to track
cat's phone and tell me

30:10.476 --> 30:11.975
Where she is right now.

30:14.145 --> 30:15.579
Oh, god.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.114
What is it?

30:17.116 --> 30:18.182
No, I just-- I heard a noise.

30:18.184 --> 30:20.317
I'm gonna go check it out.

30:23.955 --> 30:26.323
I can't stop the transfer.

30:27.525 --> 30:28.992
No.

30:39.370 --> 30:41.038
No way. You were
a cage fighter?

30:41.040 --> 30:42.973
Yeah. But I had
to stop doing it.

30:42.975 --> 30:45.475
They were afraid I was
gonna kill someone.

30:45.477 --> 30:48.011
Shut up!
Swear to god.

30:48.013 --> 30:50.314
This one time I knocked
this guy out so bad...

30:50.316 --> 30:53.483
Strike team en route.
Eta, two minutes.

30:53.485 --> 30:54.918
I got to go.

31:01.492 --> 31:03.994
Cage fighter.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.301
Hey, get out.
Strike team's on its way.

31:11.303 --> 31:12.870
Tess, I can't.
I've got to stop...

31:17.141 --> 31:19.142
Never mind.
I'll be out in a minute.

31:19.144 --> 31:21.545
Okay, you can yell at me later.
I was just trying

31:21.547 --> 31:24.114
To protect you,
but now we don't have much time.

31:24.116 --> 31:25.449
We have to destroy
these servers

31:25.451 --> 31:29.519
Everything about you.
Is there anything else I should know?

31:29.521 --> 31:31.521
There's a strike team
on the way.

31:45.136 --> 31:47.137
# put on your war paint...

31:53.145 --> 31:55.579
# you are a brick tied to me
that's dragging me down... #

31:57.349 --> 32:00.350
# strike a match and I'll
burn you to the ground #

32:00.352 --> 32:01.952
# we are the jack-o'- lanterns
in July #

32:01.954 --> 32:03.587
# setting fire to the sky

32:03.589 --> 32:05.188
# here, here comes

32:05.190 --> 32:06.657
# this rising tide

32:06.659 --> 32:09.526
# so, come on...

32:10.930 --> 32:12.329
# put on your war paint...

32:14.232 --> 32:15.332
# crosswalks

32:15.334 --> 32:16.400
# and crossed hearts

32:16.402 --> 32:17.601
# and hope to die

32:17.603 --> 32:19.236
# seal the clouds

32:19.238 --> 32:20.504
# with gray lining

32:20.506 --> 32:22.005
# so we can take

32:22.007 --> 32:23.140
# the world back

32:23.142 --> 32:24.274
# from the heart-attacked

32:24.276 --> 32:26.343
# one maniac at a time

32:26.345 --> 32:28.312
# we will take it back

32:28.314 --> 32:30.480
# you know time crawls on

32:30.482 --> 32:32.316
# when you're waiting
for the song to start #

32:32.318 --> 32:35.252
# so dance alone
to the beat of your heart #

32:35.254 --> 32:37.554
# hey, young blood

32:37.556 --> 32:41.358
# doesn't it feel
like our time #

32:41.360 --> 32:43.260
# is running out?

32:43.262 --> 32:45.629
# I'm gonna change you

32:45.631 --> 32:47.264
# like a remix

32:47.266 --> 32:48.665
# then I'll raise you

32:48.667 --> 32:50.367
# like a phoenix

32:50.369 --> 32:53.236
# wearing our vintage misery

32:53.238 --> 32:57.074
# no, I think it looked
a little better on me #

32:57.076 --> 32:59.276
# I'm gonna change you

32:59.278 --> 33:01.111
# like a remix

33:01.113 --> 33:02.512
# then I'll raise you

33:02.514 --> 33:04.147
# like a phoenix

33:07.485 --> 33:10.053
# put on your war paint.

33:19.430 --> 33:20.430
Get these sectioned off here.

33:21.734 --> 33:23.467
No access-- it's not
secure up there yet.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.202
What the hell happened?
I don't know.

33:25.204 --> 33:26.670
I must have tripped an alarm.
Well, how did you get out?

33:26.672 --> 33:28.372
I'm not sure
they even saw me.

33:28.374 --> 33:30.107
They were so focused on
destroying those servers.

33:30.109 --> 33:31.641
They trashed the place,
they set a fire.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.710
Making sure all
the data was destroyed.

33:33.712 --> 33:35.178
Did we get anything

33:35.180 --> 33:36.413
From the download?

33:36.415 --> 33:38.648
It's completely worthless.

33:38.650 --> 33:40.117
Corrupted.

33:40.119 --> 33:41.485
I'm sorry.

33:41.487 --> 33:43.120
Well, at least
you got out okay.

33:43.122 --> 33:46.289
You should get home,
get cleaned up.

33:46.291 --> 33:47.491
Get some rest.

33:47.493 --> 33:49.226
Can I ask you something?

33:51.095 --> 33:52.696
Chimera.

33:52.698 --> 33:56.666
Why were you so sure that
that was the password?

33:56.668 --> 34:00.437
It was the genesis
of muirfield.

34:00.439 --> 34:02.339
Chimera was the name
of the original study

34:02.341 --> 34:04.041
I was a part of.

34:04.043 --> 34:06.343
It's a mythical creature,
a monster,

34:06.345 --> 34:08.411
Made up of...
Made up of parts

34:08.414 --> 34:10.047
From different animals.

34:12.583 --> 34:15.351
My mom was a scientist,

34:15.353 --> 34:17.120
And, uh, she...

34:17.121 --> 34:18.321
She used to wear a necklace

34:18.322 --> 34:20.123
With a chimera on it.

34:20.125 --> 34:24.828
She said it reminded her to
respect the power of nature.

34:30.802 --> 34:34.103
You be good for me, okay?

34:34.106 --> 34:37.074
I'll be back soon, I promise.

34:37.076 --> 34:39.708
You're safe now.

34:46.551 --> 34:48.685
This is the medicine
he's gonna need.

34:48.687 --> 34:52.422
Your employers, are they...
Looking for him?

34:52.424 --> 34:53.790
Uh, no.

34:53.792 --> 34:56.226
As far as they know,

34:56.228 --> 34:57.594
The experiment's...

34:57.596 --> 34:59.563
Been terminated.

35:05.236 --> 35:07.871
Bye, gabriel.

35:18.850 --> 35:21.585
We could get ice cream
on the way home.

35:21.587 --> 35:23.453
Would you like that?

35:26.457 --> 35:28.725
<i>Gabe?</i>

35:28.727 --> 35:30.193
Gabe?

35:31.596 --> 35:33.763
Are you okay?

35:33.765 --> 35:35.732
Yeah.

35:35.734 --> 35:38.468
Yeah. I'm fine.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.337
I'm just disappointed.

35:41.906 --> 35:43.306
We'll talk later.

35:43.308 --> 35:45.242
Yeah.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.217
Hey.

35:54.219 --> 35:57.354
Can you salvage anything?

35:57.356 --> 35:58.788
Doubtful.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.893
What's the matter?

36:02.895 --> 36:05.362
That woman I told you about?

36:05.364 --> 36:07.430
The one who smuggled
me out of muirfield?

36:07.432 --> 36:09.666
I never knew her name, but
I think she might have been

36:09.668 --> 36:12.636
Detective chandler's mother.

36:12.638 --> 36:14.471
It looks like catherine's
involvement with muirfield

36:14.473 --> 36:17.440
Goes a lot deeper than just
wanting revenge for Evan.

36:17.442 --> 36:19.643
Not to add gasoline to the fire,

36:19.645 --> 36:21.578
But can I show you something?

36:28.654 --> 36:32.255
The bolts holding it
to the floor?

36:32.257 --> 36:34.357
Completely sheared off.

36:34.359 --> 36:37.894
A fire didn't do that.

36:37.896 --> 36:39.729
No.

36:39.731 --> 36:45.268
Someone or something very,
very strong tore them apart.

36:45.270 --> 36:49.539
Looks like your new friend has a
lot more secrets than you know.

36:58.450 --> 37:01.284
You wanted to see me?

37:03.454 --> 37:05.855
You put this on my desk.

37:09.393 --> 37:11.728
They're from
Evan's files.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.597
How'd you find it?

37:13.599 --> 37:15.565
Evan buried it.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.901
That was all I found.

37:17.903 --> 37:20.503
He thought
it would hurt you unnecessarily.

37:22.807 --> 37:26.276
Hmm.

37:26.278 --> 37:30.680
So, what, am I supposed to think
Evan's some kind of hero now?

37:30.682 --> 37:33.683
Is he my friend
'cause he hid some file

37:33.685 --> 37:36.486
That said my brother was
on drugs when he got killed?

37:36.488 --> 37:37.988
I just thought

37:37.990 --> 37:41.358
That it would help you
make sense of what happened.

37:41.360 --> 37:45.729
And maybe help you move on
from this crusade to find Evan.

37:45.731 --> 37:49.332
You don't think he deserves
to pay for what he did?

37:49.334 --> 37:51.668
I think you're using him

37:51.670 --> 37:54.604
As an excuse
to hang on to darius.

37:56.374 --> 37:58.708
And as long as you keep
taking out your anger

37:58.710 --> 38:02.479
On Evan or Miranda... Or me...

38:02.481 --> 38:05.415
You're never going to be able

38:05.417 --> 38:07.817
To let your brother go
and say good-bye.

38:24.802 --> 38:27.504
Hey.

38:27.506 --> 38:30.674
Why are we
meeting down here?

38:30.676 --> 38:32.709
Neutral ground?

38:32.711 --> 38:36.446
Look, catherine,
I'm not mad at you.

38:36.448 --> 38:37.814
I just...
Okay, wait.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.649
Just let me go first.

38:39.651 --> 38:42.319
Um... I'm sorry.

38:42.321 --> 38:46.923
I thought I had a chance
to expose muirfield.

38:48.492 --> 38:50.860
A chance
to keep you safe, and...

38:52.630 --> 38:55.765
...It made me reckless.

38:57.702 --> 39:00.937
Look, you weren't reckless.
You were right.

39:00.939 --> 39:03.807
And maybe if we'd gone
in there together,

39:03.809 --> 39:06.776
Then, we would have
muirfield's files by now, but...

39:06.778 --> 39:09.379
After what happened to Evan...

39:09.381 --> 39:11.715
I understand.

39:11.717 --> 39:14.951
Maybe too well.

39:14.953 --> 39:19.055
I think that we need
to stop worrying

39:19.057 --> 39:21.791
About protecting you
or protecting me,

39:21.793 --> 39:23.693
And-and start thinking about

39:23.695 --> 39:25.862
Protecting us,
and there is

39:25.864 --> 39:29.132
Only one way to do that.

39:29.134 --> 39:33.503
Yeah. The only way for us
to be together,

39:33.505 --> 39:36.506
To have some kind
of life is, uh,

39:36.508 --> 39:39.075
If we destroy muirfield.

39:39.077 --> 39:41.111
Together.

39:41.113 --> 39:43.646
And not just for us.

39:43.648 --> 39:47.517
For all the people
that they've hurt.

39:47.519 --> 39:50.987
I, uh...

39:50.989 --> 39:54.991
I got to ask you a question.

39:54.993 --> 39:57.727
All right.

39:57.729 --> 40:00.630
Agent davis--
he might have been a defector,

40:00.632 --> 40:03.500
But he managed
to find you pretty easily.

40:03.502 --> 40:05.168
And you know it won't be long

40:05.170 --> 40:07.437
Before more
of them find you, yeah?

40:07.439 --> 40:10.140
So, if you had a choice,

40:10.142 --> 40:13.877
I mean, would you want me to,
to keep you at a safe distance?

40:13.879 --> 40:16.646
If-if I had a new place
to live, would...

40:16.648 --> 40:19.182
Would you want me
to keep it a secret from you?

40:19.184 --> 40:22.786
That has got
to be the dumbest question

40:22.788 --> 40:25.655
Anyone's ever asked me.

40:26.891 --> 40:28.858
Of course not.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.995
Good. I was hoping
you'd say that.

40:31.997 --> 40:35.865
I, um... I got
something to show you.

40:39.003 --> 40:41.070
Yeah.

40:48.879 --> 40:51.181
So...

40:51.183 --> 40:52.849
What do you think?

40:52.851 --> 40:54.584
Could you see yourself

40:54.586 --> 40:56.920
Visiting your boyfriend
here once in a while?

40:56.922 --> 40:58.655
It's beautiful.

41:00.658 --> 41:03.059
It's perfect.

41:04.995 --> 41:10.567
# I'm scared you'd never feel
that safe again #

41:10.569 --> 41:14.204
# can someone hold my hands?
