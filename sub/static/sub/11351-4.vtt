WEBVTT

00:10.381 --> 00:11.684
It worked once,

00:12.121 --> 00:16.750
but obviously it's-- it's still a prototype
so there's-- there's bound to be glitches.

00:17.568 --> 00:18.926
A few false starts.

00:19.368 --> 00:21.200
Never apologize for your work.

00:22.987 --> 00:24.187
You've earned your stripes.

00:25.103 --> 00:26.035
April.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.887
New Dawn is ready and waiting.

00:31.694 --> 00:32.894
If this works...

00:34.173 --> 00:35.500
we'll be making history.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.484
Connors' hard drive's encrypted,

00:41.768 --> 00:42.826
nearly there.

00:43.433 --> 00:45.943
Please don't tell me I broke
into Connors' lab for nothing.

00:52.338 --> 00:53.665
Okay, I'm in.

00:54.612 --> 00:56.412
What is it, what's he doing.

01:00.012 --> 01:01.370
Anomaly readings?

01:09.328 --> 01:10.401
What is it Jess?

01:10.521 --> 01:12.446
You wouldn't believe where
this anomaly is.

01:12.935 --> 01:14.024
Try me.

01:20.293 --> 01:23.688
Connor! Open up.
It's a direct order.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:37.789 --> 01:38.973
What have you done?

01:41.726 --> 01:42.531
Love it.

01:44.173 --> 01:46.557
How about congratulations...
no?

01:47.805 --> 01:50.293
This is the first man made
anomaly in history and...

01:50.884 --> 01:51.942
I made that.

01:52.062 --> 01:52.810
Lock it.

01:55.226 --> 01:58.226
I suggest you turn around and
leave this lab immediately.

01:59.615 --> 02:03.879
Because under no circumstances is
anyone going to lock this anomaly.

For www.addic7ed.com

02:41.024 --> 02:42.271
Philip we have to do our job.

02:42.391 --> 02:44.118
Matt, if we lock this anomaly now

02:44.450 --> 02:46.945
the readings just get weaker.
We might lose it altogether.

02:47.225 --> 02:48.757
Oh and that would be bad.

02:49.830 --> 02:50.509
What?

02:51.804 --> 02:54.741
Come on Abby, it's--it's perfectly
safe. Look at the size of it.

02:55.388 --> 02:57.899
You couldn't even get a T-Rex's
toe through there.

02:58.019 --> 02:59.165
I know what I'm doing.

03:00.555 --> 03:01.487
No you don't.

03:04.329 --> 03:05.655
You really really don't.

03:07.911 --> 03:10.406
This lab belongs to Prospro.

03:11.369 --> 03:12.727
It's not your jurisdiction Matt.

03:13.722 --> 03:15.901
If I have to eject you, I will.

03:16.769 --> 03:17.685
Okay.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.459
Abby it's okay, I'll talk
to you later.

03:22.122 --> 03:22.690
What?

03:23.981 --> 03:25.354
Philip knows what he's doing.

03:26.428 --> 03:27.423
Come on.

03:36.194 --> 03:39.984
You two seem to know what your
at so... let's leave it unlocked

03:40.104 --> 03:41.626
and I'll increase security, yeah?

03:42.415 --> 03:45.052
Philip. These results
are incredible.

03:45.328 --> 03:46.749
You have to come over here.

03:46.869 --> 03:48.533
April I'm on my way.

03:50.057 --> 03:50.878
After you.

03:51.549 --> 03:52.228
Sure.

04:00.578 --> 04:01.699
Secure the room.

04:04.478 --> 04:07.083
Sorry I should have been cool
back there. I wasn't thinking.

04:07.203 --> 04:09.047
Locking that anomaly's not
enough.

04:09.631 --> 04:12.552
With Connors machine they can
open another and another...

04:12.868 --> 04:13.958
Then we destroy it.

04:14.605 --> 04:15.852
But Philip will know it was us.

04:15.972 --> 04:18.426
So? It doesn't matter anymore.
We'll have won.

04:18.546 --> 04:22.072
Its sending data some where's else.
This is bigger than just Connors lab.

04:22.583 --> 04:23.388
Power station.

04:28.063 --> 04:29.531
Let me talk to Connor again.

04:30.115 --> 04:32.847
If he shuts it down Philip won't suspect
a thing and then we can deal with it.

04:32.967 --> 04:34.363
Do you think he'll still
listen to you?

04:35.168 --> 04:35.815
I don't know.

04:37.384 --> 04:39.784
But I got to give it one
last try.

04:39.904 --> 04:40.447
Okay.

04:47.083 --> 04:48.346
I need to talk to Connor.

04:54.156 --> 04:55.467
Listen I don't wanna fight.

04:56.493 --> 04:59.745
I just want to know why it's so important
for Philip to open his own anomaly.

05:01.340 --> 05:03.503
Surely you can tell me
now Connor.

05:06.532 --> 05:07.164
Okay.

05:09.469 --> 05:13.511
This whole thing, Abby, has been
about energy.

05:14.162 --> 05:18.394
Free, green, infinitely renewable
energy.

05:18.514 --> 05:21.331
You know harnessing the anomaly in
a controlled environment

05:21.451 --> 05:24.836
that's the key. That could be the
answer to the world's energy crisis.

05:27.246 --> 05:29.820
There are wars going on right
now over energy.

05:29.940 --> 05:32.110
And shortages that cause economies
to collapse.

05:32.230 --> 05:34.309
We can end all that

05:34.956 --> 05:36.788
because Philip's going to
give the energy away

05:36.908 --> 05:38.663
completely free.

05:40.255 --> 05:42.497
Nobody makes a profit from this.

05:48.497 --> 05:50.328
You shouldn't be messing
with nature like this.

05:52.380 --> 05:54.575
We don't understand enough
about the anomalies.

05:54.695 --> 05:57.172
Scientists are <i>always</i>
messing with nature,

05:57.292 --> 05:59.951
it's what we do, it's-- it's called
progress.

06:00.071 --> 06:00.961
You know what I think?

06:01.245 --> 06:01.703
What?

06:03.042 --> 06:05.473
You kept this secret cause deep
down you felt you were doing wrong.

06:05.593 --> 06:07.558
No I... I'm not doing.

06:09.216 --> 06:11.126
This is exactly why I
didn't tell you before.

06:11.246 --> 06:13.147
I knew all this stuff would
just go over your head.

06:15.821 --> 06:17.652
I didn't mean that the way it
sounded.

06:18.221 --> 06:19.405
This isn't about us.

06:19.752 --> 06:20.478
I know that.

06:20.598 --> 06:22.294
That thing's dangerous and
we need to shut it down.

06:22.610 --> 06:24.568
What would Cutter say if
he could see you now?

06:24.902 --> 06:27.271
He would never put people
in danger for the sake of research.

06:27.391 --> 06:29.655
Cutter was a scientist. Just
like Philip.

06:29.939 --> 06:32.197
- He wanted to change the future.
- No he didn't.

06:32.317 --> 06:33.791
He really didn't Connor.

06:34.944 --> 06:36.444
That's what Helen wanted.

06:54.741 --> 06:56.241
Matt look at this.

06:59.911 --> 07:01.175
Something come through?

07:02.075 --> 07:03.022
What is that?

07:03.669 --> 07:04.411
Oh.

07:04.923 --> 07:05.838
Disgusting.

07:06.438 --> 07:07.481
No.

07:07.749 --> 07:09.723
Insects. Gross.

07:09.843 --> 07:10.496
Come on.

07:27.856 --> 07:29.356
Matt it's ok, he put
it back through.

07:30.129 --> 07:31.471
That's the last thing
he should have done.

08:05.501 --> 08:07.537
- We've gotta get him out.
- No. Too late.

08:07.657 --> 08:09.122
******

08:09.836 --> 08:11.289
Incursion detected.

08:11.999 --> 08:16.104
Lockdown procedure initiated...
evacuate.

08:16.224 --> 08:19.057
The beatles must have set off
the bioscan. That's a good thing

08:19.177 --> 08:20.052
The labs an isolation room.

08:20.172 --> 08:21.504
Suck the air out of the room
and kill them.

08:21.624 --> 08:24.836
No it won't. It's got oxygen coming
through your anomaly.

08:24.956 --> 08:28.846
Evacuate. Evacuate.

08:33.693 --> 08:34.434
Hey.

08:35.243 --> 08:37.485
We need to get on to Lester
and tell him this is not a drill.

08:39.159 --> 08:39.933
Emily.

08:40.975 --> 08:42.996
You should leave with the rest
of the non essential staff.

08:43.629 --> 08:45.350
- Who's he calling non essential?
- Look.

08:46.802 --> 08:48.997
It was an unfortunate choice of words,
but he's got a point

08:49.117 --> 08:50.623
and it is his call. I'm sorry.

08:54.356 --> 08:55.556
What do we do not?

08:57.182 --> 09:00.088
Once we've evacuated the Arc
we'll pump pesticide into the lab.

09:00.208 --> 09:02.377
Kill as many as we can before
we lock the anomaly, yeah.

09:05.480 --> 09:07.391
Get him out of here
as soon as possible.

09:12.996 --> 09:14.559
Lockdown.

09:16.946 --> 09:21.456
Lockdown.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.014
Lockdown complete.

09:24.134 --> 09:24.938
Wait Matt.

09:25.348 --> 09:27.922
Is it just my imagination or
are there less of them?

09:29.422 --> 09:31.001
They must be going back
through the anomaly.

09:31.121 --> 09:33.290
Or they're getting out some
other way.

09:33.638 --> 09:35.249
That's impossible. That rooms
sealed tight.

09:35.369 --> 09:35.896
Matt.

09:42.567 --> 09:44.319
Those walls are reinforced
concrete.

10:29.041 --> 10:30.399
They're in the air
conditioning ducts.

10:30.519 --> 10:32.167
That means they're going to
be all over the building in minutes.

10:32.287 --> 10:32.751
Yeah.

10:34.615 --> 10:35.341
Matt.

10:40.558 --> 10:41.663
Ah.

10:47.252 --> 10:48.878
- You alright?
- Yeah.

10:48.998 --> 10:50.015
- You're sure.
- Yeah.

10:50.899 --> 10:52.289
What now.
We scared 'em off?

10:55.068 --> 10:56.125
What's that?

11:17.940 --> 11:18.967
It's the queen.

11:34.604 --> 11:35.267
Hey.

11:35.678 --> 11:36.246
Matt.

11:37.067 --> 11:37.904
Fill me in.

11:38.867 --> 11:40.114
Well we can't pick them
off separately

11:40.234 --> 11:42.025
because they'll be outside
the Arc before we get them all.

11:42.145 --> 11:44.078
But the good news is they
won't leave the queen.

11:44.587 --> 11:47.003
There's some other *** in the docks
we can track their movements in there

11:47.123 --> 11:49.643
and hit them all together. Our only
chance is to get them together.

11:49.763 --> 11:51.885
Jess what's directly under us
on the floor below?

11:52.605 --> 11:54.595
Directly under you is...

11:58.021 --> 11:58.905
is me.

12:07.535 --> 12:08.688
You're right over the hub.

12:08.808 --> 12:10.491
Jess can you get me up a map
of the docks please?

12:10.611 --> 12:11.174
Okay.

12:11.778 --> 12:13.815
Becker, Abby, go to the armory
and get me something

12:13.935 --> 12:15.441
big enough to trap and
hold the queen.

12:15.561 --> 12:17.257
Then bring back as much
pesticide as you can carry.

12:17.377 --> 12:17.873
Okay.

12:18.899 --> 12:19.562
Sorry.

12:21.527 --> 12:22.980
What about me. What--What
can I do?

12:23.406 --> 12:24.827
Jess any sign of those maps?

12:24.947 --> 12:25.458
Got them.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.148
Okay where does the
duct above me go.

12:27.268 --> 12:28.640
It runs right around
the ops room.

12:28.760 --> 12:29.335
Then where.

12:29.455 --> 12:32.430
There's a junction. It splits
into two smaller pipes.

12:32.550 --> 12:34.435
That's perfect. That's too
small for the queen.

12:35.509 --> 12:37.025
Okay Connor make yourself useful.

12:37.435 --> 12:40.151
Get down there and take a panel off
the ceiling. Expose that junction

12:40.271 --> 12:41.430
then wait for me, okay?

12:41.550 --> 12:43.846
- I'm gonna lock the anomaly.
- No you're not. You've done enough already.

12:44.446 --> 12:47.130
I've given you a job now maybe this
time you'll do what I suggest.

12:48.630 --> 12:51.330
Connor if we're not there when that
colony hits that dead end

12:51.450 --> 12:53.250
they're gonna chew through that
duct and we'll have lost

12:53.370 --> 12:54.627
our only chance okay?

12:54.747 --> 12:56.676
Now go. I'll lock the
anomaly.

13:52.811 --> 13:54.343
They're quicker than
I thought.

13:54.885 --> 13:55.832
Come on.

14:26.245 --> 14:29.024
- Don't shoot.
- What the hell?

14:30.382 --> 14:33.555
- I gave you a direct order.
- I know. I just thought you were wrong.

14:33.812 --> 14:37.680
I assume this is what you are looking
for. There are plenty more back here.

14:38.786 --> 14:41.028
What are you waiting for?
Come help me.

14:43.606 --> 14:47.158
We really need a clearer chain
of command around here.

15:01.299 --> 15:05.120
I hate insects. Worse than spiders,
worse than dinosaurs.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.180
Here's your charge.

15:07.827 --> 15:08.585
Thanks.

15:09.990 --> 15:10.764
Listen.

15:11.695 --> 15:16.546
Matt I know how you must
feel about me right now but...

15:16.957 --> 15:19.815
it's just that machine is the most
important thing I've ever worked on.

15:20.746 --> 15:22.625
I never thought that anybody'd
get hurt.

15:22.745 --> 15:24.725
You think that was bad...
it hasn't even started yet.

15:28.650 --> 15:31.698
It's Philip. He must have found
out that you locked the anomaly.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.881
- I'll deal with him in a bit.
- Come on.

15:34.292 --> 15:36.218
- Where do you want the box.
- Right there.

15:38.681 --> 15:39.439
Here.

15:40.292 --> 15:42.344
- She disobeyed a direct order.
- Yeah. Get used to it.

15:43.047 --> 15:45.353
They'll eat through this fast.
It won't hold them for long.

15:45.473 --> 15:47.768
Long as we get one or two minutes
out of it that should be enough.

15:54.724 --> 15:56.761
Matt.... they're coming.

15:56.881 --> 15:58.397
Okay we need this thing.

15:59.849 --> 16:02.628
Nobody fire until I say. We have
to spray all of them, no stragglers.

16:02.748 --> 16:04.602
And whatever happens don't
kill the queen.

16:04.722 --> 16:05.265
Why not?

16:05.385 --> 16:05.913
Ready?

16:06.033 --> 16:07.144
- Ready.
- Go.

16:14.573 --> 16:15.457
Now?

16:17.658 --> 16:18.731
Now!

16:34.410 --> 16:35.184
Jess.

16:37.063 --> 16:38.531
Don't stop, don't stop.

16:44.162 --> 16:45.314
It's not working.

16:45.772 --> 16:46.909
Jess Jess.

16:50.184 --> 16:52.142
- I'm out.
- Now I'm out too.

16:52.262 --> 16:53.437
Okay move, move.

16:53.557 --> 16:54.574
Go go.

16:55.695 --> 16:56.737
Come on keep moving.

16:59.314 --> 17:01.035
They got the queen out.

17:13.388 --> 17:15.425
That was our only way
of controling them.

17:17.051 --> 17:18.615
Now what are you doing.

17:22.057 --> 17:22.863
Jess.

17:23.275 --> 17:24.159
Jess.

17:25.738 --> 17:26.954
What's wrong with you?

17:42.352 --> 17:43.820
I feel weird.

17:43.940 --> 17:45.005
She's burning up.

17:45.368 --> 17:47.405
Abby didn't you get bitten too?

17:47.673 --> 17:49.836
One of them bit my wrist but I feel
okay. They can't be venomous.

17:49.956 --> 17:52.647
No you don't understand. I'm
alergic to insect bites.

17:52.988 --> 17:55.577
I need an epi pen. There should
be some in the medical bay.

17:55.697 --> 17:56.540
Here.

17:56.850 --> 17:57.750
I'll take her.

17:57.870 --> 17:59.534
Okay. Emily, Abby cover
Becker.

17:59.902 --> 18:01.751
Connor...

18:01.871 --> 18:04.365
answer that phone and tell
Philip exactly what's going on here.

18:04.937 --> 18:06.500
I'll fix this.

18:07.084 --> 18:08.411
I'll make this right.

18:16.274 --> 18:17.079
Philip.

18:17.199 --> 18:19.100
What the hell is going
on there?

18:19.448 --> 18:21.200
Why have we lost the data
feed to the anomaly.

18:21.320 --> 18:22.258
Yeah we had to go into lockdown.

18:22.378 --> 18:24.589
We've got a serious incursion of
prehistoric beetles here.

18:24.709 --> 18:27.273
I know that because the bioscan
has been triggered but that does not

18:27.393 --> 18:29.057
explain what happened
to the <i>feed</i>!

18:29.177 --> 18:32.341
We had to lock the anomaly.
Philip the guard you left here...

18:32.841 --> 18:36.283
he's been killed. Jess got bitten
and she's in a really bad way.

18:36.403 --> 18:40.546
Connor I know things are difficult right
now but I need you to unlock

18:40.666 --> 18:42.536
that anomaly as soon
as possible.

18:42.656 --> 18:44.811
Did you not hear what I said?
A man's dead.

18:44.931 --> 18:48.348
The beetles are all over the Arc. They
managed to tunnel their way out of my lab.

18:48.468 --> 18:49.052
Wait.

18:49.172 --> 18:51.799
Are you telling me that they've
managed to burrow their way

18:51.919 --> 18:53.751
through reinforced concrete?

18:53.871 --> 18:55.803
Yeah they tore through
that wall in minutes.

18:56.324 --> 18:58.124
Philip I'm gonna have to go.

18:58.244 --> 18:59.119
Connor

18:59.436 --> 19:00.699
Shall I call Prospro?

19:00.819 --> 19:03.620
Yes. Under no circumstance is that
lockdown to be lifted without my say so.

19:03.740 --> 19:04.694
Do you understand?

19:07.157 --> 19:08.136
Okay what'd he say?

19:08.256 --> 19:10.790
Oh... he's a bit distracted
at the minute.

19:10.910 --> 19:11.437
What?

19:12.180 --> 19:14.422
Well I'm all out of ideas mate
so it's your turn.

19:14.542 --> 19:17.011
We need something to deal with the
whole Arc. Can we electrocute them?

19:17.131 --> 19:18.065
Use sonar?

19:18.185 --> 19:19.613
Haven't got the
equipment for that.

19:19.733 --> 19:20.449
It's um...

19:22.107 --> 19:23.007
There is something.

19:23.127 --> 19:23.639
What?

19:24.172 --> 19:25.025
Follow me.

19:27.630 --> 19:28.325
Hey.

19:28.445 --> 19:29.784
Come on you're doing
really well there.

19:29.904 --> 19:32.319
Not far now.
How are you feeling?

19:32.439 --> 19:34.198
Insect bite ***

19:34.318 --> 19:34.814
Shhh...

19:57.818 --> 19:59.003
Here Emily.

20:00.466 --> 20:01.208
Come on.

20:04.493 --> 20:06.245
What was that?

20:09.259 --> 20:10.759
They've developed a taste for
the wiring.

20:10.879 --> 20:12.054
Yeah that's not good news.

20:12.174 --> 20:12.875
What's the plan?

20:12.995 --> 20:15.528
I'm going to open my anomaly.
Recalibrate it to send out a pulse

20:15.648 --> 20:18.086
of Gamma rays. That should
wipe out all the beetles at once.

20:18.206 --> 20:19.870
That'll kill everything in the Arc.

20:20.717 --> 20:22.312
Never said it was a perfect plan.

20:30.263 --> 20:31.131
Here's fine.

20:31.251 --> 20:31.968
Okay thanks.

20:32.442 --> 20:33.737
- You okay?
- Yeah thanks.

20:35.189 --> 20:36.373
Becker!

20:41.914 --> 20:44.235
Carbohydrate gel, electrolytes.

20:44.355 --> 20:46.067
Much tastier than walls
and wiring.

20:46.187 --> 20:47.219
There's no adrenaline.

20:52.763 --> 20:55.069
Jess you must have your own
epi pen.

20:55.189 --> 20:57.848
Yeah in the car but with all these
medical things I've never brought it in.

20:58.669 --> 21:00.958
If we open these sealed doors
that's it. There's no controling them.

21:01.078 --> 21:02.463
We need to get her to a hospital.

21:03.584 --> 21:06.032
You keep the beetles in the ARC
you've a chance of wiping them out.

21:06.152 --> 21:10.058
Yeah and if we don't get you adrenaline...
We have to take the risk.

21:10.178 --> 21:11.763
Philip has to lift lockdown.

21:11.883 --> 21:13.014
Back to the loading bay exit.

21:13.134 --> 21:14.025
I'll meet you there.

21:14.145 --> 21:15.237
Right. Come on.

21:16.358 --> 21:17.132
You okay?

21:17.590 --> 21:19.421
It's all clear.

21:21.121 --> 21:23.568
- We've lost power in here.
- We'll think of something else.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.305
Hang on.

21:30.244 --> 21:31.444
We still have power.

21:33.323 --> 21:34.428
Strange.

21:36.828 --> 21:38.470
See this--this doesn't. It...

21:39.707 --> 21:41.112
This is not beetle damage.

21:41.996 --> 21:45.454
We've got reports of electricity problems
in 80% of the ARC.

21:45.574 --> 21:47.483
That means these creatures
must be nearly out.

21:48.288 --> 21:49.599
These things will breed.

21:49.719 --> 21:51.633
We're talking about a plague.

21:52.628 --> 21:54.144
We can't risk New Dawn.

21:55.928 --> 21:56.938
Not now.

21:57.507 --> 21:58.217
Philip.

21:59.862 --> 22:03.052
There is one decisive way of
dealing with the threat.

22:04.584 --> 22:08.041
What you're doing here...
It's going to change the whole planet.

22:09.131 --> 22:10.662
If it comes to it...

22:12.075 --> 22:13.559
isn't that worth the sacrifice.

22:21.105 --> 22:22.936
Might be able to retrieve
some data from here.

22:23.056 --> 22:23.884
Just forget about it Connor.

22:24.004 --> 22:26.015
It doesn't make any sense.
This looks like it's been...

22:29.080 --> 22:30.722
been blasted by an EMB

22:33.390 --> 22:34.417
You did this.

22:35.411 --> 22:36.185
What?

22:37.081 --> 22:40.649
Was locking it not enought Matt? Do you
not know how important all this work is?

22:40.769 --> 22:43.112
We don't have enough time for this.
We need to come up with a workable plan.

22:43.232 --> 22:43.901
I had a plan.

22:44.021 --> 22:45.733
A Gamma ray would have
killed everyone Connor.

22:45.853 --> 22:47.296
There's no adrenaline left
in the building.

22:48.338 --> 22:50.265
Get Philip to lift lockdown or
Jess is gonna die.

22:58.158 --> 22:58.916
Connor.

22:59.036 --> 23:02.247
Philip we need to get
Jess to a hospital... now.

23:02.504 --> 23:05.567
I'm afraid that's impossible. We can't
afford to breach the integrity of the ARC.

23:05.687 --> 23:07.021
Philip Jess could die.

23:07.141 --> 23:09.516
If these beetles get out
thousands could die.

23:09.636 --> 23:12.026
Oh so what's the plan then?
You gonna just leave us in here?

23:12.146 --> 23:15.200
We predict that these beetles will be
through the outer wall within 10 minutes.

23:15.509 --> 23:16.851
That's the time limit.

23:18.778 --> 23:22.393
There is another way to neutralize this
threat given the whole city is at risk.

23:24.782 --> 23:26.297
Tell us what it is Philip.

23:26.866 --> 23:30.418
An auto destruct program was built
into the ARC operating system.

23:31.113 --> 23:33.040
If activated the ARC

23:34.240 --> 23:37.255
and everything in it
will be incinerated.

23:42.507 --> 23:45.270
The radiation from the Gamma ray, would
it penetrate lead?

23:45.586 --> 23:46.581
Depends on how thick it is.

23:46.701 --> 23:48.112
Would we be safe
in the panic room?

23:49.170 --> 23:51.776
Well maybe but... why are we even talking
about this. We can't do it you

23:51.896 --> 23:53.070
fried my hard drive.
Remember?

23:53.190 --> 23:55.076
If you had a back up hard drive
could you restart the anomaly?

23:55.196 --> 23:55.755
Matt.

23:56.118 --> 23:58.533
Well I don't have a backup hard drive.
April said it was a security risk.

23:58.653 --> 24:00.579
Where you going?
What's going on?

24:00.699 --> 24:04.464
Your hero is prepared to kill you
and all of us, that's what's going on.

24:07.132 --> 24:08.395
Through here.

24:13.099 --> 24:14.173
How you feeling?

24:15.483 --> 24:19.510
I've felt worse, but at least there was
tequila and dancing involved.

24:20.111 --> 24:23.095
We need to get this fever down.
I need drinking water and a cloth.

24:23.215 --> 24:24.548
Have a look in the car.

24:32.688 --> 24:33.667
How did he get in here?

24:33.787 --> 24:35.469
I don't know.

24:36.117 --> 24:37.506
Abby locked him in the lab.

24:39.527 --> 24:40.411
Yeah.

24:40.775 --> 24:44.659
That's directly above us. If he can get
down here so can the beetles.

24:47.728 --> 24:49.023
Nice work.

24:51.123 --> 24:53.096
Who let the tigers in here
anyway?

24:53.216 --> 24:53.744
What?

24:53.864 --> 24:55.434
Becker cold water.

24:55.554 --> 24:57.123
Quick let's get her in
the car first.

25:02.808 --> 25:04.039
We copied your hard drive.

25:10.554 --> 25:11.864
I don't understand.

25:17.086 --> 25:18.523
So you were in my lab.

25:23.591 --> 25:25.170
Is this what it's come down to.

25:25.290 --> 25:27.807
You two just sneaking around
and plotting against me?

25:28.148 --> 25:29.237
We had to.

25:30.043 --> 25:31.274
You wouldn't listen to me.

25:33.943 --> 25:36.500
We'll deal with this later.
Right now you've got work to do.

25:45.303 --> 25:47.813
Matt. Abby. Can you here me?

25:48.792 --> 25:50.908
The coms are down. Where
the hell is Abby.

25:51.028 --> 25:53.750
- We need to get Jess out of here now.
- I'm sure they're working on it.

25:55.606 --> 25:58.139
Get them off me. Get them
off me.

26:01.496 --> 26:02.386
Your fine.

26:02.506 --> 26:03.697
Come here, come here.

26:03.817 --> 26:04.985
I'm so cold.

26:05.633 --> 26:08.033
- I'm so cold.
- I know come here.

26:08.153 --> 26:09.501
You've got a fever.

26:09.817 --> 26:10.622
Here.

26:10.875 --> 26:12.612
You need to drink this.
That's an order.

26:12.732 --> 26:14.053
You're mean you know that.

26:14.173 --> 26:17.416
Yes I do know that. I'm very
mean. Now drink this.

26:20.261 --> 26:21.587
Here.

26:21.707 --> 26:23.830
- I hate you.
- No you don't.

26:25.030 --> 26:26.151
Shhh.

26:28.314 --> 26:29.672
I'm sorry.

26:30.361 --> 26:31.987
You're nice really.

26:32.350 --> 26:34.940
You've got lovely hair.

26:35.919 --> 26:38.256
And that you are...

26:44.493 --> 26:45.424
Jess.

26:49.198 --> 26:49.940
Emily.

26:52.265 --> 26:53.907
Pulse is getting weaker
and weaker.

26:54.444 --> 26:56.954
What was that?

27:27.661 --> 27:28.845
No sign of beetles.

27:28.965 --> 27:31.640
Once the anomaly's been reopened
Connors gonna collapse it.

27:32.257 --> 27:34.168
Basically send it's
energy into reverse.

27:34.831 --> 27:35.968
Like when you lock an anomaly.

27:36.552 --> 27:37.894
Way way more intense than that.

27:38.014 --> 27:40.547
The pressure'll be so great it will
produce a great blast of energy.

27:40.667 --> 27:41.936
Gamma radiation.

27:42.056 --> 27:43.183
And that'll kill them?

27:43.303 --> 27:46.316
Yeah that should do the trick.
If it works.

27:46.900 --> 27:49.711
It'll be like an explosion ripping though
the ARC. Any living thing that's not in

27:49.831 --> 27:50.974
the panic room will be
whipped out.

27:54.099 --> 27:55.205
Abby what about the creatures?

27:55.325 --> 27:57.368
Well the cells are lead lined.
They'll be okay.

27:57.620 --> 27:59.041
As okay as us anyway.

28:00.620 --> 28:02.641
Right I better get the others
to the panic room.

28:06.290 --> 28:07.521
What about you two?

28:07.641 --> 28:09.353
Once this is open there'll be time
for us to get there.

28:09.653 --> 28:10.569
Is that true?

28:11.106 --> 28:13.221
This isn't some noble
sacrifice Armageddon thing where

28:13.341 --> 28:14.737
you blow yourselves up
to save the rest of us?

28:14.721 --> 28:16.142
Well I hope not.
If I'm honest.

28:17.358 --> 28:18.053
Good.

28:19.126 --> 28:20.137
We'll be fine.

28:21.274 --> 28:22.032
Go.

28:33.869 --> 28:35.164
Emily this way.

28:47.689 --> 28:48.700
We're losing her.

28:48.820 --> 28:49.994
It'll be okay.

28:50.594 --> 28:52.315
Connor and Matt will get us out.

28:54.881 --> 28:55.655
Rex.

28:56.776 --> 28:59.255
- He's still in my lab.
- Abby he's not. He got out.

28:59.547 --> 29:00.383
What.

29:01.678 --> 29:02.720
I gotta find him.

29:02.840 --> 29:03.589
Abby no!

29:03.709 --> 29:04.189
Abby!

29:08.578 --> 29:11.926
Was that true?
Is there time?

29:13.685 --> 29:14.648
Not sure.

29:15.311 --> 29:17.285
But if we don't try this
then everybody dies.

29:20.190 --> 29:22.385
So what are we lookin at here
50-50?

29:26.351 --> 29:28.151
60-40. I can live with those odds.

29:28.271 --> 29:32.667
Let's just say it's... better than
winning the jackpot in the National Lottery.

29:34.498 --> 29:36.456
That's like 10 million to one.

29:37.593 --> 29:39.646
Yeah. I did say better than.

29:41.249 --> 29:42.986
Well if you're not in it
you can't win it.

29:47.076 --> 29:48.307
Got three minutes.

30:17.605 --> 30:18.505
- We're nearly there.
- Good.

30:21.087 --> 30:22.144
What's that?

30:26.621 --> 30:29.700
I'm sorry Connor.
I have no choice.

30:29.820 --> 30:31.879
Philip whatever you've done
cancel it.

30:31.999 --> 30:34.042
I need one more minute
I'm nearly there.

30:34.162 --> 30:35.952
Think what would happen
if they got out.

30:36.879 --> 30:38.111
To homes

30:39.958 --> 30:41.174
hospitals

30:41.743 --> 30:42.706
to schools...

30:42.826 --> 30:46.787
And to New Dawn you mean. Philip please.
Just give us 30 more seconds.

30:52.270 --> 30:53.423
Will he abort it?

30:58.550 --> 30:59.387
Rex.

31:00.571 --> 31:01.393
Rex.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.826
- You ready?
- Connor.

31:18.289 --> 31:20.010
At least the others will be safe.

31:36.045 --> 31:37.403
I'm not dying in here mate.

31:38.682 --> 31:39.598
Rex.

31:46.395 --> 31:47.421
Rex!

31:48.937 --> 31:50.090
Connor I have an idea.

31:50.210 --> 31:51.606
Is the water pump system
still intact.

31:51.726 --> 31:53.027
It should be.
You good?

31:53.469 --> 31:55.127
- Yeah.
- Okay.

31:56.696 --> 31:57.833
Oh well then.

32:05.143 --> 32:05.806
Rex.

32:07.544 --> 32:08.381
Rex.

32:40.672 --> 32:42.487
Rex we don't have time.

32:58.886 --> 33:00.070
Where the hell are they?

33:12.255 --> 33:13.250
Where's Abby?

33:13.739 --> 33:15.003
She went to find Rex.

33:16.218 --> 33:18.397
- No.
- Connor.

33:25.669 --> 33:26.569
Rex.

34:05.012 --> 34:05.818
Abby!

34:06.986 --> 34:07.760
Abby.

34:10.744 --> 34:11.565
Abby.

34:13.650 --> 34:14.820
Oh, thank God.

34:14.940 --> 34:15.578
Got him.

34:16.509 --> 34:18.562
- Abby about...
- Connor we've really gotta go.

35:03.515 --> 35:04.383
Okay.

35:04.503 --> 35:05.709
We're still alive?

35:06.492 --> 35:07.945
Don't sound so surprised.

35:08.065 --> 35:09.729
I always knew the
plan would work.

35:11.166 --> 35:13.029
- You okay?
- Yeah.

35:14.797 --> 35:17.545
Becker wait. We don't
know if it's safe yet.

35:18.413 --> 35:19.439
She needs adrenaline.

35:22.629 --> 35:25.044
See, I did it.

35:25.589 --> 35:26.979
He aborted the program.

35:27.232 --> 35:29.647
Cause if he hadn't we'd all
be burned alive by now.

35:32.695 --> 35:33.468
Yeah.

36:02.124 --> 36:05.292
They did it. They destroyed
the beetles.

36:08.629 --> 36:10.129
Lift the lockdown.

36:15.570 --> 36:18.507
Come on Philip. Come on
what are you waiting for.

36:40.559 --> 36:47.873
Five, four, three, two one.

36:56.236 --> 36:58.130
Her pulse is getting stronger.

37:05.305 --> 37:06.095
Hey.

37:14.267 --> 37:18.594
I'm gon- I'm gonna- I'm gonna
go do some security stuff.

37:43.628 --> 37:44.481
Hey.

37:46.897 --> 37:48.286
Everything alright?

37:48.918 --> 37:51.302
Apart from the whole near
death experience thing.

37:54.431 --> 37:55.346
What's wrong.

37:55.662 --> 37:57.810
I had to check, I had
to be sure.

38:00.162 --> 38:00.841
What?

38:02.120 --> 38:05.278
The beetles must have chewed through
the wiring so the failsafe didn't work.

38:06.809 --> 38:08.136
Philip did it.

38:10.107 --> 38:12.396
He ran the incineration program.

38:14.875 --> 38:16.328
He was gonna kill us all.

38:50.650 --> 38:51.613
Philip.

38:52.722 --> 38:54.174
The man of the moment.

38:54.664 --> 38:56.827
You've pulled it off
again. Well done.

38:57.648 --> 38:58.469
Thank you.

38:59.259 --> 39:00.222
Connor.

39:00.616 --> 39:01.801
You're all right.

39:02.966 --> 39:04.530
We were so worried.

39:04.650 --> 39:08.130
You uh-- you able to get any data
from the anomaly before the...

39:08.250 --> 39:10.719
Oh, we did indeed. In fact we've
made huge leaps foreword.

39:10.839 --> 39:13.324
We're about to go and check over changes to
the hardware now. Do you want to come.

39:13.444 --> 39:16.580
No. No. I'm fine. I just came
by to say "Thank you" really.

39:17.196 --> 39:19.738
For a moment there I thought
you were going to incinerate us all.

39:20.733 --> 39:22.833
You do understand my
position don't you?

39:23.404 --> 39:26.183
I mean everything we do at
the ARC is for the greater good.

39:26.303 --> 39:28.962
Protecting the public
comes first.

39:29.640 --> 39:30.840
I understand.

39:30.960 --> 39:32.387
It's the same with New Dawn.

39:41.795 --> 39:42.995
Ah. Jack I'll be right with you.

39:43.115 --> 39:43.595
Yes sir.

39:43.715 --> 39:47.495
Oh, I should let you get on with
your work. Thank you.

39:47.615 --> 39:48.806
I'll see you tomorrow then.

39:48.926 --> 39:49.785
Pleasant day.

39:51.779 --> 39:53.389
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

40:40.185 --> 40:41.353
Helen.

40:43.082 --> 40:45.309
I've seen the future Philip
and I know.

40:45.429 --> 40:47.535
Our hopes rest on you.

40:48.465 --> 40:50.391
You'll find a way.
You must.

40:51.086 --> 40:53.422
The future is in your hands.

40:56.780 --> 40:58.406
I should have listened to you.

40:58.526 --> 41:01.327
It's just I felt like I was carrying
on Cutters work,

41:04.170 --> 41:05.922
and that he might
be proud of me.

41:08.413 --> 41:09.582
Somehow

41:10.150 --> 41:12.298
Do you think Philip
still trusts you?

41:13.798 --> 41:14.461
Yeah.

41:15.345 --> 41:18.613
And I'm willing to do anything--
anything I can to make this right.

41:19.608 --> 41:21.329
But there's something
I need to tell you.

41:22.655 --> 41:24.834
The machine I made...
in my lab.

41:25.592 --> 41:29.508
It's just a prototype. Philip
built another one.

41:31.679 --> 41:33.573
It's a hundred times
it's size,

41:33.693 --> 41:36.194
and it's infinitely more
powerful and now

41:36.314 --> 41:37.631
he's got the key.

41:38.003 --> 41:41.430
And he knows how to open his
anomaly because I showed him how.

41:43.356 --> 41:44.603
It's too late.

41:47.258 --> 41:49.263
There's no way we
can stop him now.
