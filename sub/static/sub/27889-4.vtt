WEBVTT

00:13.946 --> 00:14.981
Logan: Wait.

00:15.014 --> 00:17.116
So you're saying
that we're good to go?

00:17.150 --> 00:19.385
That we're gonna
make it to Thea?

00:19.418 --> 00:21.654
I physically cannot repeat
myself again.

00:22.989 --> 00:25.158
Well, halle-fucking-lujah!

00:25.191 --> 00:26.259
-( laughing )
-Ha!

00:26.292 --> 00:28.228
-Eric.
-Logan: What?

00:29.595 --> 00:30.597
Guy who owned this.

00:31.998 --> 00:34.034
Hey.

00:34.067 --> 00:35.535
-He said that
was his name.
-( Logan scoffs )

00:36.969 --> 00:40.506
-Where are you going?
-To find a bathroom.

00:40.540 --> 00:45.345
Logan, I don't think
it's a good idea,
you going alone.

00:45.378 --> 00:48.348
I'm not gonna drop dead, okay?
I got meds now.

00:49.915 --> 00:51.551
But feel free
to keep fussing.

00:52.418 --> 00:53.486
( scoffs )

01:34.260 --> 01:36.196
( water flowing )

01:38.631 --> 01:40.333
( Shun exhales )

01:43.470 --> 01:44.504
Came this way.

01:47.006 --> 01:48.675
Are you going to kill him?

01:55.915 --> 01:57.650
( groaning )

01:58.851 --> 02:00.586
( grunts ) Hey.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.021
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing?

02:03.055 --> 02:04.090
( grunts )

02:04.123 --> 02:05.792
( Logan grunting )

02:05.825 --> 02:07.260
Help!

02:08.294 --> 02:09.495
Did you guys hear that?

02:09.528 --> 02:10.930
( gasping )

02:10.963 --> 02:12.198
( bones crack )

02:12.999 --> 02:14.133
Logan: No!

02:14.166 --> 02:15.301
( screams )

02:16.168 --> 02:18.505
-( grunts )
-God damn it.

02:22.041 --> 02:23.610
Get away from him.

02:24.209 --> 02:25.578
Shun: Where is he?

02:25.978 --> 02:27.447
Shun!

02:31.818 --> 02:33.453
Fuck! ( groans )

02:35.855 --> 02:36.889
Shit.

02:36.922 --> 02:38.925
( groaning )

02:39.993 --> 02:42.395
( powering up )

03:00.079 --> 03:01.914
Baum: What happened to him?

03:01.947 --> 03:04.416
Eric, he attacked him.

03:04.450 --> 03:05.651
What do you mean "attacked"?

03:05.684 --> 03:06.952
Katie: I don't know.

03:06.986 --> 03:08.354
He tried to strangle him.

03:08.387 --> 03:10.255
( Logan grunting )

03:10.289 --> 03:13.493
-He was crying blood.
-Eric?

03:14.160 --> 03:15.428
I'm sorry, what?

03:17.964 --> 03:19.699
There was something
in his eye.

03:21.734 --> 03:23.269
( shuddering )

03:23.870 --> 03:25.371
I think it was alive.

03:32.044 --> 03:33.513
automated voice:<i> Ring 10.</i>

03:35.481 --> 03:38.651
Henri: Are you sure
he's on this level?

03:38.685 --> 03:41.421
Shun: He left blood
on the button.

03:42.855 --> 03:44.924
( wind howling )

04:08.914 --> 04:11.251
-Shun: Let's go.
-Wait.

04:13.118 --> 04:14.487
What're you doing?

04:18.491 --> 04:20.793
( Henri breathing heavily )

04:37.777 --> 04:39.946
Shun: What the fuck
is that thing?

04:39.979 --> 04:41.781
I have no idea.

04:44.183 --> 04:47.086
-( indistinct chatter )
-( music playing )

04:47.120 --> 04:48.354
woman: Come on,
come on, come on.

04:48.388 --> 04:51.857
Okay, okay. Okay, okay.
( laughs )

04:51.891 --> 04:54.226
-I'm a chronic disorder?
-man: Yes. ( laughs )

04:54.259 --> 04:56.362
Henri: I affect nerve tissue?

04:57.163 --> 04:58.665
The spinal cord?

04:59.165 --> 05:00.265
Yes!

05:00.299 --> 05:01.467
( laughs )

05:01.500 --> 05:03.669
Do I affect the eyes?

05:03.702 --> 05:04.870
woman: Yes.

05:04.904 --> 05:09.008
Am I Neuromyelitis Optica?

05:09.042 --> 05:10.509
( all groaning )

05:10.542 --> 05:13.579
Otherwise known
as Devic's Disease.

05:13.613 --> 05:14.414
Yes!

05:14.447 --> 05:16.315
Yes, yes! Got it.

05:16.349 --> 05:18.317
( Henri laughs )

05:18.351 --> 05:20.386
( all laughing )

05:20.419 --> 05:23.322
( indistinct chatter )

05:23.355 --> 05:27.960
I read your paper
on chain-terminating
inhibitors, Dr. Gasana.

05:27.993 --> 05:30.263
It was fascinating.

05:30.296 --> 05:34.567
I'd introduce myself,
but you seem to know
everything already.

05:35.701 --> 05:38.571
Laura Kassman.
I'm with the government.

05:38.971 --> 05:40.773
I'm flattered.

05:40.806 --> 05:46.645
Didn't think you guys
made house calls or bar calls,
in this instance.

05:46.678 --> 05:49.649
I wanted to see you
in your natural habitat.

05:49.682 --> 05:52.785
I'm looking for a geneticist
with your specialism.

05:54.386 --> 05:57.023
Someone who lives
and breathes his work.

05:58.591 --> 06:00.059
You are looking at him.

06:05.965 --> 06:08.868
So this is the guy
Rey crippled and Shun killed

06:08.901 --> 06:11.904
because he was infected
with whatever made Eric crazy?

06:13.973 --> 06:16.141
Just wanted everyone
to hear that out loud.

06:16.175 --> 06:18.444
They both
came out of Cell 50.

06:19.278 --> 06:21.514
Everyone else in there
is dead.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.816
Just racking up the corpses,
aren't we?

06:30.289 --> 06:34.393
I don't understand.
I thought the priority
was stopping Eric.

06:34.427 --> 06:37.963
-( clattering )
-( Shun sighs )

06:37.996 --> 06:39.465
It was.

06:39.498 --> 06:43.403
But Henri...
We think we found something.

06:44.470 --> 06:45.871
Abigail:
Keep the doors closed, okay?

06:45.904 --> 06:47.407
Venisha: Do you have to
go with them?

06:48.407 --> 06:50.410
I wanna help Henri.

06:50.942 --> 06:52.344
( sighs )

06:52.378 --> 06:54.413
Don't let them hurt Eric.

06:54.446 --> 06:56.482
Not until we understand
what's going on.

07:05.124 --> 07:06.559
Rey: Where's she going?

07:08.761 --> 07:10.463
( exhales ) You don't
need to worry about it.

07:11.430 --> 07:12.999
( groans )

07:19.705 --> 07:21.207
I'm sorry about Taylor.

07:23.309 --> 07:25.144
Abigail said that
you knew him.

07:26.512 --> 07:28.681
Were you close?

07:31.483 --> 07:33.186
I was in love with him.

07:37.456 --> 07:39.592
I keep thinking
I could have saved him.

07:40.893 --> 07:43.663
I should have stopped him
going to Cell 50.

07:46.599 --> 07:49.034
I don't know how to do this.

07:49.067 --> 07:50.703
A part of me is just gone.

07:55.441 --> 07:58.878
It will start to repair.
It always does.

08:01.747 --> 08:03.516
Just give me something.

08:03.549 --> 08:07.185
Just give me anything
that will make me forget.

08:07.219 --> 08:08.821
( sighs )

08:20.132 --> 08:21.267
Here.

08:30.642 --> 08:31.944
-( groans )
-Slowly, slowly.

08:37.616 --> 08:39.718
Katie: What's he gonna do?
Logan: I don't know.

08:39.751 --> 08:41.621
This is everything
we could find.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.002
Thought it might be that.

08:59.405 --> 09:00.907
Everyone back.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.121
What the hell is that thing?

09:16.154 --> 09:17.156
Amputation laser.

09:18.824 --> 09:20.760
Keep it pointing
at the body, Doc.

09:22.461 --> 09:24.063
Gurney, please.

09:30.369 --> 09:33.071
Abigail: On three.
One, two, three!

09:33.105 --> 09:34.607
( all grunt )

09:36.575 --> 09:37.810
( body thuds )

09:42.747 --> 09:44.483
You're gonna cut him open.

09:44.516 --> 09:45.717
Wait, what?

09:45.751 --> 09:47.620
I need to look inside.

09:47.653 --> 09:49.254
Do we have to be here?

09:49.288 --> 09:50.723
It's safer
if you stay with us.

09:52.357 --> 09:55.061
Someone needs
to keep him upright.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.929
( scoffs ) No chance.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.168
Just don't get my fingers.

10:22.254 --> 10:24.824
( device pulsing )

10:37.336 --> 10:38.904
I'm not hungry.

10:39.605 --> 10:40.672
Eat.

10:40.706 --> 10:42.274
I need you sober
for this.

10:44.343 --> 10:46.178
And you'll need to
sign an NDA.

10:57.789 --> 10:59.191
( drone whirring )

11:20.079 --> 11:23.315
automated voice:
<i> Welcome, Dr. Gasana.
Enjoy your visit.</i>

11:27.920 --> 11:29.689
<i> Commencing analysis.</i>

11:32.724 --> 11:34.392
<i> Mapping genome.</i>

11:34.426 --> 11:35.861
It's all top-of-the-range.

11:38.230 --> 11:40.265
I didn't think we had labs
like this.

11:40.298 --> 11:42.134
-In South Africa.
-automated voice:<i> Data...</i>

11:42.167 --> 11:44.570
Henri: What exactly
do you do here?

11:44.603 --> 11:47.206
Matters of national
security, mostly.

11:48.640 --> 11:51.109
-Special assignments.
-automated voice:
<i> Loading data...</i>

11:51.143 --> 11:56.048
Unfortunately,
our latest project has, uh,
somewhat hit a brick wall.

11:56.082 --> 11:58.217
-That's why you came to me.
-automated voice:
<i> Results due in...</i>

11:58.250 --> 12:01.420
You're an expert
in DNA-targeted systems.

12:01.453 --> 12:06.992
I understand your focus is
designing them to treat rare
diseases, correct?

12:07.025 --> 12:10.663
It's a little
more complicated,
but that's the idea.

12:10.696 --> 12:12.731
automated voice:
<i> Results due in one...</i>

12:12.764 --> 12:15.133
We're using
the same technology,

12:15.166 --> 12:17.837
only we want it
to do the opposite.

12:19.337 --> 12:24.210
We want to target
specific cells
in an individual's DNA,

12:24.243 --> 12:27.113
and trigger a disease.

12:28.947 --> 12:29.915
Why?

12:35.553 --> 12:37.089
Jokonya?

12:37.122 --> 12:38.656
Laura: Since his rise to power,

12:38.690 --> 12:42.861
hundreds of thousands
of refugees have poured
across the border,

12:42.894 --> 12:44.930
fleeing his country
into ours.

12:44.963 --> 12:49.167
All of them desperate,
all in need of food
and shelter.

12:49.201 --> 12:52.304
We're simply not equipped
for this level of crisis.

12:52.337 --> 12:55.441
You mean the government
can't afford the cost?

12:55.474 --> 12:57.142
People are dying, Dr. Gasana.

12:57.175 --> 12:59.912
In less than a year,
we'll hit famine.

12:59.945 --> 13:03.048
( sighs )
hen there'll be rioting,
and next, civil war.

13:03.081 --> 13:05.518
Unless Jokonya
is stopped.

13:09.755 --> 13:12.191
You want to assassinate him?

13:12.224 --> 13:15.327
It's a little
more complicated,
but that's the idea.

13:16.161 --> 13:18.864
If Jokonya's regime
continues,

13:18.897 --> 13:21.633
South Africa will come
apart at the seams.

13:21.666 --> 13:24.035
We need an untraceable weapon.

13:24.069 --> 13:26.338
Something that can never
be tracked back to us.

13:28.574 --> 13:31.577
We're trying to save
hundreds of thousands
of lives.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.981
At the cost of one.

13:38.017 --> 13:39.852
-( device pulsing )
-( all grunting )

13:42.288 --> 13:43.556
Logan: Jesus Christ!

13:44.356 --> 13:45.524
( gasps )

13:45.557 --> 13:47.193
-( coughing )
-Hmm.

13:52.264 --> 13:54.400
Abigail:
God, what is that stuff?

13:54.433 --> 13:56.201
Lana: We saw it in Cell 50.

13:56.234 --> 13:58.204
The whole place
was covered in it.

13:58.737 --> 14:01.373
( Abigail groaning )

14:01.407 --> 14:03.108
( Logan coughs )

14:05.811 --> 14:07.279
Abigail: Oh... ( winces )

14:09.581 --> 14:11.183
Oh, my God!

14:11.216 --> 14:12.351
Ugh!

14:24.163 --> 14:26.432
What the fuck is that thing?

14:28.901 --> 14:31.102
Jesus Christ.
Is it still alive?

14:31.135 --> 14:34.006
No, I think it's decomposing.

14:34.405 --> 14:35.374
You think?

14:36.909 --> 14:39.110
Wait, what are you gonna do?

14:39.144 --> 14:41.180
We gotta blast
the body into space.

14:41.913 --> 14:43.581
Right? Get rid of it.

14:43.615 --> 14:45.050
Do you understand what this is?

14:47.586 --> 14:49.421
We're looking at first contact.

14:49.988 --> 14:51.957
Fuck first contact.

14:51.990 --> 14:54.593
One of those things
tried to squirm inside
my head.

14:54.626 --> 14:57.062
If we destroy it,

14:57.095 --> 14:59.565
we lose all capacity
to understand...

14:59.598 --> 15:02.067
We don't need
to understand it.

15:02.101 --> 15:05.671
That sent Taylor homicidal,
and there's a live one
in Eric.

15:06.538 --> 15:07.839
What we need
is to kill it.

15:07.873 --> 15:09.374
( sighs )

15:09.408 --> 15:14.113
We have no idea what this
creature is capable of.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.017
Or how it dies.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.186
Bullets worked
with Taylor.

15:21.219 --> 15:23.455
-I'll hedge my bets.
-( gun cocks )

15:23.488 --> 15:25.123
-I'm coming with you.
-No, you're not.

15:25.156 --> 15:27.826
-I wasn't asking.
-No use to me on this, Lana.

15:27.860 --> 15:31.096
I made the wrong call
with Taylor.

15:32.931 --> 15:34.600
I won't this time.

15:39.270 --> 15:43.342
-Where do we start?
-Shun: Ring 10.
That's where he was last.

15:48.614 --> 15:49.681
( grunts )

15:49.714 --> 15:51.116
( panting )

15:54.686 --> 15:56.689
( groaning )

16:27.453 --> 16:29.221
Abigail:
Can you tell us anything?

16:30.388 --> 16:34.727
Henri: It's insect-like.
Invertebrate.

16:36.261 --> 16:39.631
No indication that flesh
has been eaten away.

16:39.664 --> 16:42.166
It's formed
semi-permanent bonds
in the brain,

16:42.200 --> 16:45.070
reminiscent of obligate
parasites on Earth.

16:45.104 --> 16:47.406
English, please,
Dr. Frankenstein.

16:52.744 --> 16:58.350
There are species
that survive or reproduce
by entering a host.

16:58.383 --> 17:02.921
They can be capable of
drastically altering behavior,
or at times,

17:02.955 --> 17:06.525
entirely controlling
their mental faculties.

17:06.558 --> 17:09.762
You're saying this thing
might've controlled Taylor
in the same way?

17:11.362 --> 17:13.699
If the creature
is controlling the brain,

17:15.000 --> 17:17.636
it's tapping into
higher mental processes.

17:25.477 --> 17:26.378
( clatters )

17:26.411 --> 17:27.679
Eric: ( over speakers)<i> Hello?</i>

17:28.814 --> 17:30.115
( Eric exhales )

17:31.783 --> 17:33.452
<i> Please, somebody.</i>

17:44.629 --> 17:46.098
Who is this?

17:46.131 --> 17:47.466
Eric:<i> Venisha?</i>

17:50.803 --> 17:52.036
( device beeps )

17:52.070 --> 17:54.306
Eric, I can't talk to you.

17:54.339 --> 17:57.743
Eric: ( panting )
<i> Venisha, please. Please.</i>

17:58.844 --> 18:01.480
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

18:01.513 --> 18:05.150
I keep blacking out,
and there's whole chunks
of my memory missing.

18:06.551 --> 18:08.821
<i> I don't remember
what I've done.</i>

18:11.456 --> 18:14.693
There's blood all over me,
and I think...

18:18.496 --> 18:21.633
Did I try and hurt that woman?

18:21.667 --> 18:23.669
( Eric panting )

18:25.637 --> 18:26.504
( device beeps )

18:26.538 --> 18:28.874
The others said
you tried to kill her.

18:29.774 --> 18:32.210
Oh, God, I don't remember.

18:32.244 --> 18:35.614
( sobs )
What's happening to me?

18:35.647 --> 18:37.516
( inhales and exhales )

18:37.549 --> 18:39.818
<i> There's something
wrong with me.</i>

18:42.654 --> 18:44.323
I deserve to die.

18:46.024 --> 18:48.227
-( beeps )
-You don't say that.

18:50.161 --> 18:52.397
We all came here
for a second chance.

18:53.698 --> 18:55.167
( sniffles ) I know.

18:58.703 --> 19:00.405
( winces and sighs )

19:03.941 --> 19:05.277
Thank you.

19:06.845 --> 19:08.247
Thank you for talking to me.

19:10.314 --> 19:12.417
I'm glad I'm not alone.

19:15.186 --> 19:17.256
-( beeps )
-Where are you?

19:18.657 --> 19:19.658
( sighs )

19:24.029 --> 19:26.632
Henri: One of you,
help me with him.

19:27.032 --> 19:28.600
Let's go.

19:28.634 --> 19:30.068
No, thank you.

19:30.101 --> 19:31.937
I need to move him
before the body decays.

19:33.237 --> 19:35.273
Sorry, Doc. Screw that.

19:35.306 --> 19:36.742
Eric's still out there.

19:38.610 --> 19:39.912
All right, let's go.

19:41.947 --> 19:45.184
If you see Eric,
drop him and run.

19:45.450 --> 19:46.518
Okay.

19:46.551 --> 19:47.553
( grunts )

19:51.923 --> 19:54.559
Trial 45910.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.662
-Batch 86-B.
-( mice squeaking )

19:57.829 --> 19:58.864
( switch clicks )

20:05.704 --> 20:08.307
-( sizzling )
-( mice squeaking )

20:13.078 --> 20:14.813
man: It killed
them all again.

20:14.846 --> 20:16.081
( all whisper indistinctly )

20:16.114 --> 20:17.883
Henri: I can see that.

20:20.184 --> 20:22.688
Still addressing
too many genes.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.423
We'll get there, Doctor.

20:27.792 --> 20:29.261
Laura:<i> What was that?</i>

20:29.294 --> 20:31.230
Henri: Batch 86-B.

20:32.331 --> 20:34.031
Don't get smart.

20:34.065 --> 20:36.334
Isn't that why you hired me?

20:36.368 --> 20:38.837
That was the fourth trial
in as many weeks.

20:40.238 --> 20:42.407
Where's my invisible bullet,
Dr. Gasana?

20:42.440 --> 20:44.243
You have your bullet.

20:45.210 --> 20:47.846
It's the invisible part
that's problematic.

20:49.781 --> 20:53.318
You're insisting we use
a brain-based virus
to carry the system.

20:53.351 --> 20:55.887
Because we're triggering
a brain tumor.

20:55.920 --> 20:59.357
They're hereditary
in Jokonya's family.
It's the perfect cover.

20:59.390 --> 21:03.595
Fine, but that's what
makes this almost impossible.

21:03.628 --> 21:07.065
I have to neutralize
the virus so that none
of the carriers before

21:07.098 --> 21:09.233
or after Jokonya
gets seriously sick.

21:09.267 --> 21:11.970
This isn't something
that can happen overnight.

21:16.641 --> 21:18.443
-( beeps )
-Dr. Theron, please.

21:19.311 --> 21:20.445
( door opens )

21:21.413 --> 21:22.480
( door closes )

21:22.514 --> 21:25.116
Dr. Theron, meet Dr. Gasana.

21:25.150 --> 21:26.918
Heard a lot about you.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.687
Who the hell is he?

21:29.454 --> 21:31.389
Competition drives results.

21:31.422 --> 21:32.891
We both know that.

21:34.159 --> 21:35.427
Good luck.

22:10.262 --> 22:12.764
( shudders )
It's freezing in here.

22:16.434 --> 22:18.036
What is this place?

22:18.069 --> 22:20.439
( indistinct radio chatter )

22:33.217 --> 22:34.553
( clatters )

22:35.787 --> 22:37.456
Shun: Cover me!

22:45.397 --> 22:47.432
( static crackling )

22:55.840 --> 22:56.842
( metallic clang )

23:00.045 --> 23:01.512
( banging on door )

23:01.545 --> 23:02.914
-Fuck!
-Lana: Come on.

23:04.349 --> 23:05.517
( Shun grunts )

23:09.854 --> 23:11.722
( panting ) For someone
who's not a doctor,

23:11.756 --> 23:13.291
you really seemed to know
what you were doing in there.

23:13.324 --> 23:14.593
Turn him, please.

23:15.226 --> 23:16.728
How do you know all this?

23:17.995 --> 23:19.131
Check on Rey.

23:25.770 --> 23:27.439
Henri?

23:29.474 --> 23:31.242
Rey? Rey.

23:31.275 --> 23:32.711
Wake up!

23:35.246 --> 23:37.015
Henri, I left her
with Venisha.

23:44.822 --> 23:46.057
( grunting )

23:48.326 --> 23:49.327
( steam hissing )

23:49.360 --> 23:50.328
Lana: Hello?

23:50.361 --> 23:51.830
( grunts )

23:51.863 --> 23:53.131
Can anyone hear us?

23:55.266 --> 23:56.168
Hello.

23:57.001 --> 23:58.203
<i> Can anyone hear us?</i>

23:59.437 --> 24:00.639
<i> Hello.</i>

24:00.672 --> 24:01.873
Lana.

24:01.906 --> 24:05.110
Henri, we're locked
in the morgue.

24:05.810 --> 24:07.212
<i> Ring 10.</i>

24:14.385 --> 24:16.621
( water dripping )

24:21.392 --> 24:23.562
( shuddering )

24:24.862 --> 24:26.031
( thud )

24:27.832 --> 24:28.934
Hello?

24:40.411 --> 24:41.746
Eric?

24:44.315 --> 24:45.917
Eric, are you in there?

24:55.393 --> 24:57.562
Eric, where are you?

25:06.170 --> 25:07.639
-Eric: You came.
-( gasps )

25:15.547 --> 25:16.748
( sighs )

25:19.317 --> 25:21.086
He led Shun and Lana there.

25:21.719 --> 25:23.088
He's clever, isn't he?

25:24.255 --> 25:26.057
( breathing heavily )

25:32.564 --> 25:35.166
Trial 45937.

-Batch 16-C.
-( mice squeaking )

( beeps )

25:57.989 --> 26:00.325
-There's your invisible bullet.
-( man chuckles )

26:07.632 --> 26:10.535
reporter:
<i> ...across the capital,</i>

26:10.569 --> 26:13.271
<i> Jokonya's death from

Lana: Shun. Shun.

26:55.180 --> 26:57.682
The cold air,
it's coming from up there.

26:57.715 --> 26:59.317
We've got to
break that thing.

26:59.350 --> 27:01.419
No, glass bullets.

27:01.452 --> 27:02.721
It'll shatter.

27:04.356 --> 27:06.791
We need something
to take it out.

27:08.526 --> 27:10.962
Stop the ventilation.

27:19.170 --> 27:21.172
( Shun grunting )

27:44.095 --> 27:45.463
Don't move.

27:45.496 --> 27:46.898
( grunts )

27:47.364 --> 27:49.434
Don't move, I said.

27:49.467 --> 27:52.336
I don't know if you're
telling me the truth
or if you're still dangerous.

27:52.370 --> 27:53.672
Stay back!

27:54.772 --> 27:55.873
( exhales )

27:55.906 --> 27:57.675
You think I'm a monster, too.

I don't know what to think.

-Eric, stay back.

Eric.

28:07.485 --> 28:08.953
I understand.

28:11.589 --> 28:13.892
I understand
if you can't trust me.

( groans )

28:19.163 --> 28:20.231
( panting )

28:28.773 --> 28:30.008
I'm sorry.

28:33.211 --> 28:34.713
For everything.

28:39.917 --> 28:41.853
( Venisha whimpers )

28:45.489 --> 28:46.891
Eric.

28:47.492 --> 28:49.360
Eric, come on,
come on.

28:50.628 --> 28:51.496

Venisha.

Get to Shun and Lana.

29:10.815 --> 29:12.316
-Wait, what are you gonna do?
-Go.

34:09.313 --> 34:11.382
Never feels the way
you expect.

34:12.483 --> 34:15.186
I didn't think
about his family.

34:20.925 --> 34:22.526
They're suffering.

34:22.559 --> 34:26.197
But think of
the many who aren't
because of what we've done.

34:30.367 --> 34:33.237
The world is full of those
who will never understand

34:33.271 --> 34:36.674
what it means to sacrifice
the few for the many.

34:39.543 --> 34:42.046
But you and I,
we're willing
to bear the scar

34:42.079 --> 34:44.248
for people who will
never know our names.

34:47.218 --> 34:50.588
And that is what
makes us heroes.

35:25.189 --> 35:26.657
You okay?

35:32.230 --> 35:33.664
What happened?

35:36.567 --> 35:37.568
Eric's gone.

35:57.821 --> 35:59.690
Venisha's gone, too.

36:18.809 --> 36:19.911
( sobbing )

36:35.392 --> 36:38.963
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

36:40.030 --> 36:41.732
I'm sorry.

36:48.639 --> 36:49.640
Shun: Thanks.

36:51.108 --> 36:52.710
No problem.

36:56.046 --> 36:57.548
I didn't mean the bandage.

36:57.581 --> 37:00.884
You didn't have
to come with me.

37:00.918 --> 37:06.390
Don't forget, I nearly let
Taylor kill you, so, sorry.

37:07.591 --> 37:08.926
Again.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.761
You know,
it takes a real asshole

37:11.995 --> 37:15.499
to make someone apologize for
not being able to kill a man.

37:19.236 --> 37:22.006
So, maybe the two
can cancel each other out?

37:24.174 --> 37:26.110
We can get
one of those things.

37:26.143 --> 37:28.345
( clicks tongue )
What do you call them?

37:28.379 --> 37:30.848
SIREN mentioned them
once or twice.

37:32.850 --> 37:34.518
A blank slate.

37:35.052 --> 37:36.721
( chuckles )

37:39.924 --> 37:41.792
( sighs ) Sounds good.

37:53.370 --> 37:55.539
What? I can cook.

38:03.981 --> 38:05.283
You all right, Doc?

38:11.154 --> 38:12.523
( plate clatters )

38:34.878 --> 38:36.047
Should we say something?

38:43.187 --> 38:44.955
-Um, we don't have to.
-Henri: No.

38:46.357 --> 38:47.725
We should.

38:51.294 --> 38:53.431
She didn't deserve to die.

38:57.534 --> 39:00.071
What was she even
doing down there?

39:00.104 --> 39:01.972
I think she was trying
to save him.

39:03.307 --> 39:04.875
Couldn't you have
gotten her out?

39:11.948 --> 39:14.552
Let's just try and eat.

39:20.056 --> 39:20.991
Venisha.

39:27.030 --> 39:28.933
-Venisha.
-Venisha.

39:34.304 --> 39:35.806
( rumbling )

39:41.111 --> 39:42.113
( chiming )

39:46.850 --> 39:48.452
( yawns )

39:54.258 --> 39:56.961
automated voice:<i> All doors
to Crew Quarters unlocked.</i>

39:59.296 --> 40:00.664
It's done.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.821
Don't you wanna
get some sleep?

40:25.355 --> 40:26.757
Not yet.

40:27.424 --> 40:28.526
( door opens )

40:34.098 --> 40:35.199
( door closes )

40:42.639 --> 40:44.442
Captain's quarters.

40:47.578 --> 40:48.946
Sweet dreams.

40:52.482 --> 40:53.951
-( beeping )
-( door opens )

41:04.127 --> 41:05.563
Are you gonna be
all right?

41:17.107 --> 41:18.676
You saved us, you know.

41:24.715 --> 41:27.084
-( beeps )
-( door opens, closes )

41:33.290 --> 41:35.526
So thanks for, uh...

41:37.293 --> 41:38.829
Just thanks. ( chuckles )

41:48.906 --> 41:50.207
Uh...

41:51.708 --> 41:53.544
-( beeps )
-( door closes )

41:59.783 --> 42:00.885
Okay.

42:02.485 --> 42:04.255
( beeping )

42:04.955 --> 42:06.090
( whirring )

42:18.969 --> 42:19.970
( inaudible )

42:27.677 --> 42:29.947
( sobbing softly )

42:33.584 --> 42:34.952
( beeps )
