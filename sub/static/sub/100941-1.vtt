01:09.820 --> 01:11.655
You are entering
a realm between

01:11.738 --> 01:13.824
clandestine and forgotten,

01:13.907 --> 01:16.577
a slipstream
caught between channels,

01:16.660 --> 01:19.580
the secret museum of mankind,

01:19.663 --> 01:22.332
the private library
of shadows--

01:22.416 --> 01:26.461
all taking place on a stage
forged from mystery

01:26.545 --> 01:31.216
and found only on a frequency
caught between logic and myth.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.886
You are entering
Paradox Theater.

01:38.599 --> 01:42.436
Tonight’s episode,
"The Vast of Night."

01:59.203 --> 02:01.747
You and the family
headed to the game?

02:01.830 --> 02:05.751
No, just me.
Patricia’s with the kids
over in Hobbs.

02:05.834 --> 02:09.004
Hobbs, huh? Good thing
we’re not playing them.

02:09.087 --> 02:10.881
Boy, ain’t that right.

02:10.964 --> 02:11.965
See you at the game.

02:22.518 --> 02:25.646
I don’t want to light
my next cigarette, Benny. I got
one here that’ll do the trick.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.648
Mrs. McBroom’s
looking for you.
Why?

02:27.731 --> 02:29.608
I’m not sure why.
I was at supper.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.485
Ingrid’s sister was giving you
the top to bottom.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.320
No, she wasn’t.
Oh, yes, she was.
In her car.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.281
With Millie when
I was walking up.

02:36.365 --> 02:39.368
Great damn dogs,
what was that?
That’s why they were calling.

02:39.451 --> 02:42.496
Make me feel better, Benny.
Make me feel better.
This is not good.

02:42.579 --> 02:45.749
Arlo’s under the stands
figuring it out. Last time
it happened, it was a squirrel

02:45.832 --> 02:49.253
that had bitten through a wire,
but the wire was still
in the mouth of the skeleton.

02:49.336 --> 02:52.214
So is this the lights
or the electric? We can’t roll
if it’s flickering.

02:52.297 --> 02:55.634
I don’t know. I was at supper.
How many times you gonna
tell me you were at supper?

02:55.717 --> 02:58.929
Now-- Sam, what’s barn
buzzard’s buzz, man?

02:59.012 --> 03:01.765
I don’t know.
It’s just blinking in there.
Let’s plug it in.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.684
I haven’t had
anything to test it.
Let’s figure it out.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.102
Come on, plug it in.
Okay.

03:06.812 --> 03:08.272
Be careful.
If it electrocutes you,

03:08.355 --> 03:10.566
you’ll stop growing hair
and never get a date.

03:10.649 --> 03:13.068
Oh, tune out, man.
Go find Mrs. McBroom.

03:13.151 --> 03:16.989
I will, but I don’t like
that tone, Sam. If it’s blinking
when you start recording,

03:17.072 --> 03:19.908
stop recording, or I’ll have
one of them Buell brothers
come beat the water out of you.

03:19.992 --> 03:23.078
Everett. Hey.
Mrs. McBroom is looking for you.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.956
Renny, up in the stands
with his horn.
I know. Benny told me.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.292
-So what does she want?
-I don’t know.
She’s just walking around,

03:28.375 --> 03:31.628
asking everybody,
"Where’s Everett?
Have you seen Everett?

03:31.712 --> 03:34.298
When’s Everett getting here?"
That tells me nothing, Renny.

03:34.381 --> 03:37.509
Go sit down with your horn.
Matter of fact, give it to me.
There’s something wrong with it.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.052
I used to play trombone.
Everett!

03:39.136 --> 03:41.471
Can I bring you
my tape recorder so you can
show me how it works?

03:41.555 --> 03:44.433
I don’t know what you said, Fay.
You sound like a mouse
being eaten by a possum.

03:44.516 --> 03:45.934
Renny, give me your horn.

03:46.018 --> 03:47.436
Can I bring you
my tape recorder
so you can show me how it works?

03:47.519 --> 03:49.646
Yeah, sure, Fay. Renny, now.
Great!

03:49.730 --> 03:51.398
Why?
Drop it down now, Renny.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.066
You can’t hurt it.
What am I gonna do, Renny?

03:53.150 --> 03:56.195
What-- Drop it down now.
Come on. Come on.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.864
Yeah. There. Good boy.
Hey, where are you going?

03:58.947 --> 04:01.575
Everett! Everett!
Bye, Renny. Bye, Renny.

04:01.658 --> 04:05.287
Arlo told me to bring you down.
Why? Where is he?
What for? Down where?

04:05.370 --> 04:09.208
He’s in the locker.
I don’t know what he wants.
They don’t tell me anything.

04:09.291 --> 04:12.461
They don’t listen to me.
He just said,
"Go grab Everett."

04:12.544 --> 04:15.005
I don’t know what’s going on.
I just got here.
I’m not gonna be able to help.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.758
I got H.H. at 7:00, so--
I know that.

04:17.841 --> 04:20.385
He just
doesn’t listen to me.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.638
Come tell him
for yourself.

04:22.721 --> 04:27.518
I told them to turn the power
off during the tornado,
but they don’t listen to me.

04:27.601 --> 04:31.188
Last time this happened,
it was a squirrel that
had bitten through the wire.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.899
Squirrel still had
the wire in his mouth.
Yeah, Benny told me.

04:33.982 --> 04:37.611
And we had a rat gnaw
through the scoreboard wire.
Did you know that?

04:37.694 --> 04:39.571
No, I did not know that.
Uh-huh.

04:39.655 --> 04:42.574
And an owl made his home
in the library attic,

04:42.658 --> 04:45.661
so we had all these
critter bones
laying around the crawl space

04:45.744 --> 04:49.790
where we keep the marching band
uniforms. Helen Trank had
a bat skull in her pocket.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.625
- Hold it.
- Why are you here?

04:51.708 --> 04:54.378
Whoa! No, no, wait.
I did that. I did that.

04:54.461 --> 04:59.341
Arlo, get out now!
Hold it.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

04:59.424 --> 05:03.387
What’s Everett doing here?
You told me
to bring him down here.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.555
No, I didn’t.
Yes, you did.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.265
I did not.
You told me.

05:06.348 --> 05:09.059
I said bring Emmett down here,
not Everett.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.520
Emmett. Emmett.
I asked you specifically

05:11.603 --> 05:13.772
if you wanted
Everett from the radio.

05:13.856 --> 05:17.317
Emmett doesn’t work
at the radio?
Everett works at the radio.

05:17.401 --> 05:19.444
Arlo, if you don’t need me,
I’m gonna get back out.

05:19.528 --> 05:22.447
Did Emmett never work
at the radio?
No, it’s just me.

05:22.531 --> 05:25.158
Emmett works
at Santa Mira Mills.
He’s an electrician.

05:25.242 --> 05:29.580
Now, hold on just a minute.
Emmett worked at the radio.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.207
Wait, wait, wait.
You told me
to bring him down here.

05:32.291 --> 05:35.627
Do you want us to record
over that last game?
And Renny wants his horn back.

05:35.711 --> 05:38.714
I know he does.
That’s why I took it.
Did you get the reel? Because--

05:38.797 --> 05:42.176
Every game use
the same reel. It’s in the back
of the recorder. I’ll show you.

05:42.259 --> 05:45.470
Are you gonna give Renny
his horn back?
If he stops being bad news.

05:45.554 --> 05:47.264
I mean, someone’s
got to spank his ass.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.224
Oh, Fay, you meant right now?
Is that okay?

05:49.308 --> 05:50.517
Uh, can you walk?
Yeah.

05:50.601 --> 05:53.020
Just let me
look at this for them.

05:53.103 --> 05:56.523
Found it. So we just use
the same reel as last time?
Same reel each game.

05:56.607 --> 06:00.485
But that’s gonna cause
some cross talk eventually.
Right? I mean, won’t it?

06:01.653 --> 06:04.072
Read the Bible, Sam?
Yes.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.533
There’s your answer.
Answer to what?

06:06.617 --> 06:08.744
Answer to everything.
But that doesn’t--

06:08.827 --> 06:11.288
Yeah, eventually.
But no one’s gonna buy
a tape for every game.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.124
If it’s a problem, I’ll ask
Mr. McKean. Maybe he’ll buy
you some new ones.

06:14.208 --> 06:17.211
But it’s not gonna make
a difference now. If power
goes out, you stop recording.

06:17.294 --> 06:20.339
I’m not buying
another one of those.
You said that.

06:20.422 --> 06:23.759
-What’s the tale, nightingale?
-What’s all the fuss?
Why you got Renny’s horn?

06:23.842 --> 06:26.136
Whoa, what’s this?
I didn’t know you’re in band.
Why aren’t you up there playing?

06:26.220 --> 06:28.222
Oh, I can’t do pep band.
I work the games

06:28.305 --> 06:30.557
so Ruth can watch them,
since Greg made varsity.

06:30.641 --> 06:33.560
Why do you have Renny’s horn?
’Cause he needs to be punished
for being Renny.

06:33.644 --> 06:36.104
Wait, you’re working?
What about, uh,
Rita Cope or Winifred?

06:36.188 --> 06:39.358
Winifred works nights in
San Mirial. Rita Cope quit.
She works at Zeb’s now.

06:39.441 --> 06:41.860
Okay, so clue me in
about this lunch box.
This is the Westinghouse?

06:41.944 --> 06:44.112
Yeah, it’s the one
you told me to get.
Ah, where’d you get it?

06:44.196 --> 06:47.157
Montgomery Ward catalog.
Play something.
What have you recorded?

06:47.241 --> 06:50.827
Well, nothing yet.
I mean, I didn’t wanna
mess anything up.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.705
You haven’t recorded anything?
No, I didn’t wanna
mess something up.

06:53.789 --> 06:56.917
You have a brand-new
tape recorder. You haven’t been
curious to push a button?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.503
I’ve been so curious.
I just didn’t want to--
I’m nervous.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.046
Are there batteries in it?
Yes.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.965
Then press record.
Pull out the mic.

07:03.048 --> 07:04.675
On the side,
are the wheels spinning?

07:04.758 --> 07:06.385
Yes.
All right, then talk.

07:06.468 --> 07:08.053
What do I say?
Try this.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.222
Raise your right hand.
Say, "I’m not now,

07:10.305 --> 07:13.141
nor have I ever been, a member
of the Communist Party."

07:13.225 --> 07:16.311
I’m not now, nor have
I ever been, a member
of the Communist Party.

07:16.395 --> 07:19.189
Around Dodge City
and in the territory out west...

07:19.273 --> 07:21.984
There’s only one way
to handle the spoilers
and the killers,

07:22.067 --> 07:25.529
and that’s with a US marshal
and the smell of gun smoke.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.781
Brought to you by L&M filters.
That was good.
You want to hear it?

07:27.865 --> 07:29.032
Yes.
All right, okay.

07:32.870 --> 07:34.580
Hey, coyotes!

07:34.663 --> 07:38.292
Yeah.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.878
Those guys know me.
I’m Everett.
I like those guys.

07:42.921 --> 07:45.424
This is Fay Crocker.
It’s not recording nothing.

07:45.507 --> 07:48.594
I know. It’s just, I’ve never
held a microphone before.
I’m practicing.

07:48.677 --> 07:51.305
I did not tell you to practice.
Told you to shut up.
I’m not shutting up.

07:51.388 --> 07:55.142
It’s my recorder.
That was good. That’s how you
got to be when we’re recording.

07:55.225 --> 07:58.395
That was queen of Cayuga.
You 500-Watt Fay.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.022
This is Fay Crocker.

08:02.024 --> 08:06.069
This is Fay Crocker.
I have never, up until now,
held a microphone.

08:06.153 --> 08:09.406
...one way to
handle the spoilers and the
killers, and that’s...

08:09.489 --> 08:11.575
Isn’t that a charge?
It’s a large charge.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.994
Press record.
Start going again.
Is that how I sound?

08:14.077 --> 08:17.331
Yeah, that’s how you sound.
That’s 100% Cayuga queen.
Press record, roll tape.

08:17.414 --> 08:21.084
What are we gonna record?
Cool it, Clyde. There’s plenty
to say. Follow me. Let’s go.

08:21.168 --> 08:25.088
I’m here with Fay Crocker,
horn player and recording expert
at Cayuga High School.

08:25.172 --> 08:28.675
Now, what would you like
to tell us about yourself, Fay?
Uh--

08:28.759 --> 08:31.803
I don’t know.
Come on, it’s spinning, sister.
Let’s bake biscuits.

08:31.887 --> 08:34.723
Uh, this is Fay-- Wait.

08:34.806 --> 08:38.060
What does that mean?
Well, it means to record,
make records. You--

08:38.143 --> 08:40.812
You need a cigarette.
Everyone smokes
with a microphone.

08:40.896 --> 08:43.482
I don’t wanna smoke right now.
Don’t cramp the cool.
It’s just something to hold.

08:43.565 --> 08:46.610
It’s like a prop.
It’ll make you more confident.
Now, give me your horn.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.779
I’m not allowed to let
anyone carry my horn.
Why?

08:48.862 --> 08:50.405
If it gets dropped,
I have to pay for it.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.241
School owns it.
No sweat. Let’s go.

08:53.450 --> 08:56.870
Uh, bacon, bacon, 940.
What is that?

08:56.954 --> 09:01.124
I heard it in a war movie.
They don’t say "bacon,
bacon, 940" during a war.

09:01.208 --> 09:04.002
Well, maybe we’re thinking
about different wars.
No, no, this is not war radio.

09:04.086 --> 09:06.922
You gotta say
something buzzin’.

09:07.005 --> 09:10.259
All right, hold it.
Walk over there to the Olivers.
We’ll interview them.

09:10.342 --> 09:13.428
Everett, no! That’s--
That’s a terrible idea.
That’s not fun at all.

09:13.512 --> 09:15.556
You have to answer
questions before
we let you into the game.

09:15.639 --> 09:18.475
Well, hello, Everett.
Wh-- What is this?
What’s going on?

09:18.559 --> 09:20.602
We’re recording interviews.
I have Cayuga winning by eight.

09:20.686 --> 09:22.729
-What are your thoughts
on the game?
-Need a light, Fay?

09:22.813 --> 09:24.731
No, I’m just holding it like
people do with microphones.

09:24.815 --> 09:27.568
Ask him a question.
I can’t.
You’re making me nervous.

09:27.651 --> 09:30.028
It’s just a question.
Ask anyone about anything,
doesn’t matter.

09:30.112 --> 09:32.781
Oh. Did you know that
a squirrel bit through
the wire in the gym?

09:32.865 --> 09:35.158
-I did not know that. Tonight?
-Oh, I knew that.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.452
It wasn’t tonight. It was
when Clem was still teaching.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.830
Now ask her to tell you more.
Tell me more.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.540
It was actually a chipmunk.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.750
A chipmunk. That was it.
Hold the mic out to her.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.752
-Tell me more.
-I don’t know any more.

09:45.836 --> 09:47.921
Ask her what
her feelings are on chipmunks.

09:48.005 --> 09:51.258
What’s your feelings
on chipmunks?
Well, they’re cute

09:51.341 --> 09:54.678
so long as they stay
out of people’s cars
and houses and hair.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.222
- That was good.
Ask her if she wants to hear it.
-You wanna hear your biscuit?

09:57.306 --> 09:59.391
What? My biscuit?
Yeah, we made a biscuit.

09:59.474 --> 10:02.019
No-- It’s not called a biscuit.
But you said
we were baking biscuits.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.897
A recording is not a biscuit.
What’s this for?
Is this going on the air?

10:04.980 --> 10:07.983
No, you’re not--
What kind of question is that?
You tune into the radio

10:08.066 --> 10:10.235
to hear a family
talking in their car,
while they’re eating?

10:10.319 --> 10:12.529
No, I guess not.
No, yeah, you don’t.
No one does.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.573
There’s your answer, unfiltered,
brought to you by me.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.867
Honey, you are too funny.
Where’d you get this bit?

10:16.950 --> 10:19.119
It comes with the recorder.
You should try it.
All you got to do

10:19.203 --> 10:21.830
is hold the microphone
up to your mouth.
Hey, Daisy.

10:21.914 --> 10:24.041
You old enough to be
going to basketball games?
Yes.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.376
I don’t know--
I think you gotta be
at least five years old.

10:26.460 --> 10:29.338
I am five years old.
Well, look out now.
Good thing for that.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.715
If you weren’t,
I’d have to take you home
and go to bed early.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.926
Have fun at the game.
I like your haircut, fuzzy duck.

10:34.009 --> 10:36.178
Thanks for including us.
Have a good night.
Bye!

10:36.261 --> 10:39.139
- Press record,
start talking about something.
-What do I say?

10:39.223 --> 10:40.224
Give me your horn.
No.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.308
I’m not gonna drop it.

10:41.391 --> 10:42.434
Take the mic out.

10:42.518 --> 10:44.561
Take it out.

10:44.645 --> 10:45.979
Good. Now, what’s your
favorite subject in school?

10:46.063 --> 10:47.689
Aren’t you
some big science girl?

10:47.773 --> 10:49.775
Yes.
All right.
Tell me about science.

10:49.858 --> 10:52.444
Be careful with my horn
or else you’ll have to
deal with Mr. Pike.

10:52.528 --> 10:55.531
Did you know that Robby Ritter
set his horn behind the car
and they backed over it?

10:55.614 --> 10:56.990
That’s good.

10:57.074 --> 10:58.659
Did you know that
Robby Ritter set his horn

10:58.742 --> 11:00.577
behind their car
and they backed over it?

11:00.661 --> 11:03.330
Sorry, what’s that?
Hello, Fay.
Hi, Mr. Stemmons.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.624
What’s this?
Is this a school project?

11:05.707 --> 11:07.668
No, Everett’s just
having me ask people questions

11:07.751 --> 11:09.586
and record them
on my tape recorder.
Well, it’s broken.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.630
What?
It’s not turning.
It stopped working.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.966
How? It’s brand-new.
I don’t know what happened.
I’m sorry.

11:14.049 --> 11:15.843
I’m sorry, Mr. Stemmons.
We’ll record you another time.

11:15.926 --> 11:18.053
Thanks for stopping.
We’ll record you another time.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.972
That’s okay.
You guys have a good night.

11:20.055 --> 11:22.683
- Can we fix it?
- Shh. It’s not broken.

11:22.766 --> 11:24.935
Mr. Stemmons is a nowhere man.
He’s a full-on pale one.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.437
We had to get out
of that conversation.
So it’s not broken?

11:27.521 --> 11:30.148
No. You can’t waste tape, Fay,
not on a tombstone
like Mr. Stemmons.

11:30.232 --> 11:33.443
Double-dealing devil-dog.
That had me so scared.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.153
You know I paid for that
with my own money.

11:35.237 --> 11:36.947
You can always do that
if someone’s a wet rag.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.241
Tell them, "It’s broken.
We’ll have to reschedule."

11:39.324 --> 11:42.202
Then you just never reschedule.
Well, I can’t
do that to someone.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.496
Oh, yeah, you can.
Why not?
’Cause it’s lying.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.957
It’s not lying.
It’s stopping someone from
embarrassing themselves.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.543
Not if you don’t make them
feel embarrassed.
Putting up the numbers means

11:49.626 --> 11:51.795
you got to get
what you want out of people,
not be afraid to cut them off

11:51.879 --> 11:53.922
or tell them to shut up.
I’m not putting up any numbers.

11:54.006 --> 11:56.550
I’m sorry, you two.
I’m gonna need to see
a license for that.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.469
Oh, this ain’t
no shotgun, Pappy Fred.
And you’re lucky it ain’t.

11:59.553 --> 12:02.181
’Cause you’d all be dead.
Fay’s got a new recorder.

12:02.264 --> 12:04.141
Talk to her.
Hey, ask them a question, Fay.

12:04.224 --> 12:08.645
Okay, about what?
Uh--
Well, now I’m nervous again.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.981
What is this?
It’s a tape recorder.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.524
Ask if they ever heard
"bacon, bacon, 940" before?

12:12.608 --> 12:14.610
Bacon? What are you--
Bacon, what?

12:14.693 --> 12:17.738
I heard it in a war movie.
Now, hold the mic
to your mouth.

12:17.821 --> 12:19.740
Have you ever heard
the phrase "bacon, bacon, 940"

12:19.823 --> 12:21.200
in a war movie?
Now to his mouth.

12:21.283 --> 12:24.703
I think you mean
"breaker, breaker."
That’s what it is.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.830
See, I was close.
Whoa, cut the gas, cube.

12:26.914 --> 12:29.166
You were a mile wide.
Do you have
your own show now, Fay?

12:29.249 --> 12:31.543
Yeah, she does.
It’s called
Teenage Rendezvous

12:31.627 --> 12:33.337
and her radio name
is Cayuga Queen.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.797
She takes requests and tells
stories of young love.

12:35.881 --> 12:37.758
That’s a great idea.
I should get my own show.

12:37.841 --> 12:39.259
All right, start studying
for your license.

12:39.343 --> 12:40.511
And learn
how to ask a question.

12:40.594 --> 12:41.595
What license?

12:41.678 --> 12:42.888
A radio license, FCC.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.139
You going to the game?
No.

12:44.223 --> 12:46.433
We gotta work.
Oh, of course.

12:46.517 --> 12:48.477
You do such a good job,
honey.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.687
How’s your mother?
Did Fay tell you
about the Grimaldis?

12:50.771 --> 12:54.107
-About their dog
getting electrocuted?
-No. Ask Fay.

12:54.191 --> 12:56.235
You need to stay out of
Fay’s business, Marjorie.

12:56.318 --> 12:58.904
It’s not Fay’s business.
It’s the Grimaldis’ business.

12:58.987 --> 13:02.533
She knows the whole business.
Just make sure you turn off
that tape machine.

13:02.616 --> 13:05.661
Oh, we’ll do exactly that.
She knows the whole business.

13:05.744 --> 13:08.288
-Shut your mouth, Marjie.
-Oh, look out now.

13:08.372 --> 13:09.873
I didn’t say anything, Fred.

13:09.957 --> 13:12.125
I could appear in court,
put my hand on a Bible--

13:12.209 --> 13:14.169
Start walking.
This is marriage problems.

13:14.253 --> 13:16.171
-Come on.
-I didn’t say anything.

13:16.255 --> 13:18.507
In front of God and everyone?
Yeah, I am.

13:18.590 --> 13:19.925
♪ And you rock
Around the world ♪

13:20.008 --> 13:22.344
♪ You rock, rock, rock ♪

13:22.427 --> 13:23.804
Tell me the word
on the Grimaldis.

13:23.887 --> 13:25.389
I don’t talk about
other people’s business.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.474
Then come up with some
other way to fill up
this tape recorder.

13:27.558 --> 13:29.852
I can’t.
I just get so nervous

13:29.935 --> 13:32.896
and I don’t know what to say.
Although, I was
enjoying it back there

13:32.980 --> 13:35.232
when we got going,
asking them questions.
It’s just you and me talking.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.735
Tell me the craziest
caller you ever had.
Oh, I know what I can tell you.

13:38.819 --> 13:41.822
Not about a caller, but about
some science I was reading.
Can I tell you about that?

13:41.905 --> 13:45.534
You certainly can,
Fay Cordelia Crocker.
That’s not my middle name.

13:45.617 --> 13:48.829
I know it isn’t. I don’t care.
I mean, I didn’t know,
but I definitely don’t care.

13:52.875 --> 13:56.545
What else you got in there?
Uh, just my mouthpiece
and some hairpins.

13:56.628 --> 14:00.090
Hairpins?
Yeah. My mom says you can
stash hairpins anywhere,

14:00.174 --> 14:03.302
and one day you’ll be
glad you did it.
Geez, that’s weird.

14:03.385 --> 14:05.429
I just read about this,
and I think it’s boss.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.514
Don’t make me feel
like a fool for liking it.
I would never.

14:07.598 --> 14:10.601
Come on, let me have it.
Razz my berries.
All right, did you know

14:10.684 --> 14:13.896
that there was actually
an experiment done this year,
in Lincoln, Nebraska,

14:13.979 --> 14:16.815
for a radio-controlled car?
By RCA. Like a full-sized one.

14:16.899 --> 14:20.235
Whoa, lay dead.
Yup. It’s called
"electronic highway control."

14:20.319 --> 14:22.529
And this article says that
there’s a series of circuits

14:22.613 --> 14:24.531
buried in the pavements with
little lights connected to them

14:24.615 --> 14:26.992
so they can communicate to
the car through radio control

14:27.075 --> 14:28.911
and take over steering
and braking. It’s crazy.
Whoa, whoa, wait.

14:28.994 --> 14:31.205
This is an experiment?
They already did this?
Mm-hmm.

14:31.288 --> 14:34.333
In Lincoln, Nebraska, in April.
You press a button
on the dash of the car

14:34.416 --> 14:37.044
that says "electronic drive,"
and the car starts
to drive itself.

14:37.127 --> 14:39.922
That’s incredible.
Yeah, I know.
And get this--

14:40.005 --> 14:43.592
Well, actually, two things.
First of all, it can tell

14:43.675 --> 14:47.179
if there’s a car stopped
up to a mile ahead, and it’ll
slow traffic automatically.

14:47.262 --> 14:49.389
Like all cars at once,
like a school of fish.

14:49.473 --> 14:53.727
And two,
it doesn’t need eyes to work,
so if your vision’s bad

14:53.810 --> 14:58.106
or if it’s raining cats and dogs
outside or if your headlamps
won’t work too well,

14:58.190 --> 15:01.109
then the car still works.
Oh, and a voice
will come over the radio

15:01.193 --> 15:03.904
and give you directions.
So if you’re on the highway

15:03.987 --> 15:06.865
and your exit’s coming up,
or if you need
to switch highways,

15:06.949 --> 15:10.744
a voice will literally interrupt
your radio and tell you
that your exit’s approaching

15:10.827 --> 15:13.872
so you can get back
behind the wheel
and take control again.

15:13.956 --> 15:16.375
I know that was three things,
but when I read this,

15:16.458 --> 15:18.585
I was like, "Wow, really?
Can all this really be true?"

15:18.669 --> 15:20.504
And it is.
It’s 100% true.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.464
Tested in April this year,
Lincoln, Nebraska.

15:22.548 --> 15:24.508
This article’s in this
Science Digest, this issue.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.969
A voice comes through
the radio, tells you
what direction to go?

15:27.052 --> 15:30.055
It’s in this article. Read it.
Does it say
when this is gonna happen?

15:30.138 --> 15:33.642
1974. And by 1990,
all roads will be electronic.

15:33.725 --> 15:36.812
Oh, really?
You don’t believe me, do you?

15:36.895 --> 15:38.856
You’re just pulling my leg.
No, I’m not
pulling your leg.

15:38.939 --> 15:41.233
I love it. I’m interviewing you.
I’m playing a part.

15:41.316 --> 15:43.318
I just remembered
two more stories.
Do we have time to do those two?

15:43.402 --> 15:46.196
Absolutely we do.
Let’s fill it up.
Well, if you like that,

15:46.280 --> 15:48.866
brace your brain for this.
There’s this article
about these tubes--

15:48.949 --> 15:50.951
You tell me all about it.
All right, hold on,

15:51.034 --> 15:53.328
’cause you got to be able
to look past all these ads

15:53.412 --> 15:55.247
and this squirrelly
beginner’s stuff.

15:56.832 --> 16:00.002
Hold on, ’cause
I wanna read it to you
the way it was written,

16:00.085 --> 16:02.504
’cause I want it to have
the same effect on you.

16:03.755 --> 16:06.633
All right, here you go.
So, "Picture a man

16:06.717 --> 16:09.344
in New York City,
in Times Square.

16:09.428 --> 16:12.055
And he walks down a set of
stairs into a subway tunnel,

16:12.139 --> 16:14.641
and he boards a train car.
And he stows his suitcase

16:14.725 --> 16:17.936
in a rack over
his head and sits down.
He starts reading a book.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.689
And about an hour later
he feels the train
coming to a stop.

16:20.772 --> 16:23.984
So he gets up,
gathers his things,
grabs his suitcase,

16:24.067 --> 16:26.987
puts on his hat,
steps out of the train,
heads up some stairs

16:27.070 --> 16:29.156
and comes out
at the Golden Gate Bridge."

16:29.239 --> 16:32.326
What? Whoa.
How is that possible?
I know. Isn’t that crazy?

16:32.409 --> 16:35.829
So the train travels
between 2,000
and 5,000 miles per hour

16:35.913 --> 16:38.207
in these tubes,
all across the country.
That’s how it’s all gonna be.

16:38.290 --> 16:40.334
It’s called
vacuum tube transportation.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.419
All these tubes
crisscross all of the world,

16:42.503 --> 16:44.379
so we’re gonna sit in cars
that run through the tubes

16:44.463 --> 16:46.673
like hot dogs
through a garden hose.
Wait a minute.

16:46.757 --> 16:48.759
It’s gonna be everywhere
by the year 2000.
Wait a minute--

16:48.842 --> 16:51.094
It’s in this article here.
Wait a minute. Hold on.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.804
Does this mean that the whole
other thing won’t happen?

16:52.888 --> 16:54.431
The radio cars and the highway?

16:55.807 --> 16:57.309
No.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.645
I think that’ll be
for shorter distances.

16:59.728 --> 17:01.647
This will replace things
like trains and airplanes.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.357
Oh, is that so?
Yeah, I think so.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.817
Like, even over oceans?
I think.

17:05.901 --> 17:08.237
Hmm.
Actually, I don’t know.
It doesn’t say.

17:08.320 --> 17:09.988
All right, looks like
we got time for one more.

17:10.072 --> 17:12.199
Are you ready with your
third story, Miss Crocker?

17:12.282 --> 17:13.992
Yes. Hold on.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.827
Actually, do I have time
for two more or just one?

17:15.911 --> 17:18.413
No, just one, I’m afraid.
Come on.
All right, well--

17:18.497 --> 17:21.500
I’m gonna end with this one
because my mom doesn’t think
this is ever gonna happen,

17:21.583 --> 17:24.294
and she said they just
say things like this
to sell magazines.

17:24.378 --> 17:26.797
What an intriguing setup, Fay.
Please, go on.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.966
Okay. Well, in the future,

17:29.049 --> 17:32.427
every baby will be assigned
a telephone number at birth
and it’ll be his for life.

17:32.511 --> 17:36.348
And we’ll all have
palm-sized dials, like
a clamshell with no receiver.

17:36.431 --> 17:40.352
Or... well, I guess
we’ll have little speakers
and microphones instead.

17:40.435 --> 17:42.896
And on one side,
you’ll have the dial.
And on the back--

17:42.980 --> 17:45.774
the back will be
a Lilliput screen, so like
a miniature television screen.

17:45.858 --> 17:48.986
And you can keep it
in your pocket, so you can
call your friend in Rome

17:49.069 --> 17:51.655
or New York or anywhere

17:51.738 --> 17:55.033
and see his face on your dial
and have a conversation,
in color.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.910
The screens
will be in color.
Which magazine is that?

17:56.994 --> 17:59.413
Modern Mechanix.
This article’s
a couple years old.

17:59.496 --> 18:03.166
But, oh, it also said
that if you call your friend
and he doesn’t answer,

18:03.250 --> 18:05.919
then you know they’re dead.
What? Why would you
know they’re dead?

18:06.003 --> 18:08.964
They always have it with them
so they can always answer.
I don’t believe that.

18:09.047 --> 18:11.216
What? Here, you can see
a picture of it.
That sounds like a space novel.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.968
I know.
I think I agree
with your mom, you know.

18:13.051 --> 18:14.678
She’s a wise keeper.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.763
I believe the train tubes
and the highways,

18:16.847 --> 18:19.474
but the tiny TV telephones,
that’s cuckoo.

18:19.558 --> 18:21.894
All right.
Hey, it’s been fun.

18:21.977 --> 18:23.770
I gotta run. Tune in.
All right? Tune in.

18:23.854 --> 18:25.647
I will. Thank you.
Oh, look out now.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.097
I got my tape recorder.
What’s that?

18:59.181 --> 19:01.350
I got my tape recorder.
That’s right. Is that it?

19:01.433 --> 19:03.227
Yeah, it’s the Westinghouse one.
And me and Everett

19:03.310 --> 19:05.145
just recorded ourselves
all the way over from the gym.

19:05.229 --> 19:08.065
You got the one
he told you about?
Yeah, listen.

19:08.148 --> 19:10.359
...Rome
or New York or anywhere

19:10.442 --> 19:12.945
and see his face and have
a conversation with him...

19:13.028 --> 19:15.697
How neat, Fay.
He is such a fun boy.

19:15.781 --> 19:18.242
He said when you record,
it’s called "baking biscuits."

19:18.325 --> 19:19.826
-"Baking biscuits"?
-Yeah.

19:19.910 --> 19:21.870
- Well, I’ll be.
-Yeah.

19:21.954 --> 19:24.373
Did you get a look
at those Pocasset boys?
Just for a sec.

19:24.456 --> 19:27.209
They were getting off
the bus. They were tall.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.545
Oh, no. Really?
Yeah.

19:29.628 --> 19:33.465
They got a bunch
of Indian boys on their team,
about four or five of them.

19:33.549 --> 19:37.636
I think there’s
a couple of families, like four
or five brothers or cousins.

19:37.719 --> 19:39.596
Probably means they’re
gonna beat us like a drum.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.807
And I don’t mean that
because they’re Indians.

19:41.890 --> 19:45.102
When they put on their jerseys,
they looked like grown-ups.
That means we’re gonna lose.

19:45.185 --> 19:48.272
Hey, were the lights
flickering in here at all?
No. Why?

19:48.355 --> 19:52.568
Oh, just ’cause they were
flickering over at the school.
Arlo’s working on it though.

19:52.651 --> 19:55.153
Last time,
when I was still teaching,
it was a squirrel.

19:55.237 --> 19:57.865
Bit through a wire.
All right, I’m off.

19:57.948 --> 20:00.659
Oh, the line to San Mirial
has got a permanent signal,

20:00.742 --> 20:03.787
so it’s skunked, so if you
wanna plug that out, it would
let Fran and Judith know.

20:03.871 --> 20:05.497
Okay, bye.

20:08.792 --> 20:11.128
Number, please?

20:16.258 --> 20:17.426
Number, please?

20:39.323 --> 20:42.117
This is WOTW radio
in Cayuga, New Mexico,

20:42.201 --> 20:44.620
and this is the news
for the hour.
Boeing has introduced

20:44.703 --> 20:47.331
its new line...

21:12.856 --> 21:15.025
Number, please?
Officer Sherman declared

21:15.108 --> 21:16.944
the incident was caused by,
and I quote...

21:17.027 --> 21:18.153
Number, please?

21:25.410 --> 21:26.411
Hello?

21:33.794 --> 21:35.504
...top-secret concept.

21:35.587 --> 21:38.841
Name of city, inward.

21:38.924 --> 21:40.717
Hey, Winnie. It’s me.

21:40.801 --> 21:42.761
Can you tell me if you’ve ever
heard this sound before?

21:50.519 --> 21:52.896
You ever heard that?
No, but put it back on.

21:52.980 --> 21:56.149
Let me let some of
the other ladies listen.
Okay.

21:59.236 --> 22:01.113
Listen, Winnie,
I got another call
coming through,

22:01.196 --> 22:02.990
so I’ll call you back
a little later.

22:07.035 --> 22:09.955
Number, please?
Hello?

22:12.082 --> 22:14.251
Hello?

22:14.334 --> 22:16.837
Hello?
Listen, ma’am, can--
can you disconnect

22:16.920 --> 22:18.380
and then try again?
It’s all...

22:18.463 --> 22:21.925
We’re calling--
It’s a strange,

22:22.009 --> 22:26.096
large object holding
over my land off of a--

22:26.180 --> 22:28.682
...like a tornado--

22:28.765 --> 22:31.768
...swirling faster.
Please, send the police...

22:31.852 --> 22:33.604
Ma’am,
is this an emergency?

22:33.687 --> 22:35.606
...because there’s something
in the canyon.

22:35.689 --> 22:37.858
Can you tell me
where you are?
We’re going in the cellar.

23:20.025 --> 23:21.360
Hello?

23:21.443 --> 23:22.945
Hey, Josie, listen.
It’s Fay.

23:23.028 --> 23:25.197
Is Officer Pruitt
or Boker around?

23:25.280 --> 23:27.991
He’s not here
and Mr. Pruitt left with him.

23:28.075 --> 23:30.577
Well, they didn’t answer
at the station.
No one’s at the station?

23:30.661 --> 23:34.039
They were here, but a trucker
just reported something.

23:34.122 --> 23:36.542
What?
He didn’t say.
It whipped the wind up

23:36.625 --> 23:38.961
and made him spill
his truck, so avocados
are all over the road.

23:39.044 --> 23:41.296
Is Officer Abbott around?
Off duty?

23:41.380 --> 23:44.675
Isn’t Judy cheerleading?
Yes, but I haven’t
seen him.

23:44.758 --> 23:49.221
Can you try and find him?
He probably left with
Mr. Boker and Mr. Pruitt.

23:49.304 --> 23:52.516
What’s going on?
I don’t know.
Probably nothing.

23:52.599 --> 23:55.352
Listen, Josie, I got
another call coming in.

23:55.435 --> 23:57.855
Can you let me know
if you hear anything?
Okay. Bye.

23:59.314 --> 24:01.900
Name of city, inward.
Fay, where’d you go?

24:01.984 --> 24:03.944
Winnie, we got
a call coming through,

24:04.027 --> 24:06.196
and the same sound
came from her line,

24:06.280 --> 24:08.657
but I-- I couldn’t get
her name or anything.

24:08.740 --> 24:11.201
She didn’t sound hurt.
What should I do?

24:13.370 --> 24:14.371
Winnie?

24:16.164 --> 24:17.165
Winnie?

24:18.584 --> 24:19.585
Winnie?

24:32.806 --> 24:35.058
Hello?
Ethel, hi.

24:35.142 --> 24:36.685
Are you listening
to the radio right now?

24:36.768 --> 24:38.520
No, I was watching TV.

24:38.604 --> 24:41.106
Can you turn
your radio on and tell me
if you hear any kind of sound?

24:41.190 --> 24:42.816
Like what?
Like...

24:42.900 --> 24:44.693
something that just came in
through the board

24:44.776 --> 24:46.486
a couple minutes ago,
and I wanted to--

24:46.570 --> 24:49.031
It went away.
I just wanted to see if it--

24:49.114 --> 24:52.117
Just call Everett.
I don’t wanna
disturb him on the air.

24:52.201 --> 24:54.578
Don’t be shy with him.
He doesn’t care if you call--

24:56.914 --> 24:57.915
Ethel?

24:59.541 --> 25:00.542
Ethel?

25:25.984 --> 25:27.861
Hello?
Grace, hi.

25:27.945 --> 25:29.738
Can you run over
and check on Ethel and Maddy?

25:29.821 --> 25:31.865
I tried the Van Ortons,
but they’re at the game.

25:31.949 --> 25:33.825
I’m afraid everyone’s
at the game right now.

25:33.909 --> 25:35.953
Who is this, now?
It’s Fay.

25:36.036 --> 25:39.957
Oh. My lands.
When I can’t see a face,
my perception gets pickled.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.583
Can you go check
on Ethel and Maddy?

25:41.667 --> 25:43.502
I suppose so.
Is everything okay?

25:43.585 --> 25:46.296
I’m in the kitchen
with my hands in
a ball of cookie dough.

25:46.380 --> 25:49.132
I think so.
It’s just-- I called Ethel
and the line got cut.

25:49.216 --> 25:53.011
We’re having a lot of
connection issues.
Well, let’s see.

25:53.095 --> 25:55.931
Can I get my hands washed off
and my cookie sheet in the oven?

25:56.014 --> 25:59.768
Or do you need me to go now?
I can go now, but I might
dirty up the doorknobs.

25:59.852 --> 26:01.895
You can wash your hands.
Whenever you get the chance.

26:01.979 --> 26:05.190
I’m sure it’s fine.
Where’s your mother?

26:05.274 --> 26:08.151
She’s working nights.
Oh, I remember her
telling me that.

26:08.235 --> 26:11.655
Sorry for calling you so late.
I tried Gertie Van Orton,
but they’re at the game.

26:11.738 --> 26:14.867
Everyone’s at the game
right now.
It’s not a bother.

26:14.950 --> 26:16.660
Let me get this finished up,
and I’ll go check

26:16.743 --> 26:19.371
and I’ll call you back.
It’s Ethel babysitting?

26:19.454 --> 26:22.040
Yes.
All right.
Give me a few minutes.

26:22.124 --> 26:24.626
All right. Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Mm-hmm. Bye-bye.

26:28.338 --> 26:31.383
Oh, and there it goes.
Spinning away.

26:31.466 --> 26:35.012
Jimmy Rain and Crocs
with their crankin’ song
"Hoppin’ and Cookin’."

26:35.095 --> 26:36.930
You’re listening to Everett
"the Maverick" Sloan,

26:37.014 --> 26:39.057
and the show, as you know,
is Highway Hits,

26:39.141 --> 26:41.727
brought to you
by Santa Mira Mills
and Cloverbloom Honey,

26:41.810 --> 26:45.230
with a co-sponsorship from
our business of the week,
the Udder Stand,

26:45.314 --> 26:50.068
providing the whole valley
with the coldest confections
and the sweetest slurgs.

26:50.152 --> 26:52.196
We know it’s a busy night
out there for everyone

26:52.279 --> 26:55.115
with the first game
of the season and
a valley rivalry at that.

26:55.199 --> 26:57.326
But just remember,
during basketball season,

26:57.409 --> 27:01.288
the Udder Stand closes
for the games and reopens
after for one hour

27:01.371 --> 27:03.207
for those who need
a little late night snack

27:03.290 --> 27:05.792
before you start
driving your tanks home

27:05.876 --> 27:08.879
and piling up some Z’s.
That’s the word from the bird.

27:08.962 --> 27:11.673
It’s a silent night in here
when the Statesmen are playing.

27:11.757 --> 27:13.800
But for the five of you
out there listening,

27:13.884 --> 27:15.552
jump on the horn,
give us your dedications,

27:15.636 --> 27:17.638
and let everyone know
you’re out there.

27:17.721 --> 27:19.681
We hope you stick around and
follow us till the sign off.

27:19.765 --> 27:22.559
WOTW time now,
12 minutes past the hour.

27:22.643 --> 27:25.103
Look out now.
62 degrees outside.

27:25.187 --> 27:27.564
Stick with our station
and get lost in our sounds,

27:27.648 --> 27:30.150
coming at you now
starting with Gabe Gunton

27:30.234 --> 27:33.278
singing "Screamin’ Scooch"
here on Highway Hits.

27:46.416 --> 27:48.794
This is WOTW, Everett
"The Maverick" Sloan.

27:48.877 --> 27:51.296
Everett, it’s Fay. I’m sorry.
Please don’t be mad at me.

27:51.380 --> 27:53.882
I thought you were a caller.
I’m sorry.
I knew you’d think that.

27:53.966 --> 27:55.634
Please don’t be mad.
Is it about
the tape recorder?

27:55.717 --> 27:57.344
No, a sound came
through the board

27:57.427 --> 27:59.179
and interrupted
your radio show.

27:59.263 --> 28:01.390
I don’t know. It’s never
come through over here.

28:01.473 --> 28:04.268
Interrupted my show?
Yeah, through the radio.

28:04.351 --> 28:06.854
What’d it sound like?
I don’t know. I can
connect you through.

28:06.937 --> 28:08.939
Did it sound Mexican?
No, it didn’t
sound Mexican.

28:09.022 --> 28:11.149
We cross signals
with this station in Mexico...

28:11.233 --> 28:13.110
It sounded like something
that could be unsafe.

28:13.193 --> 28:15.070
We had this lady--
Whoa, why? How?

28:15.153 --> 28:17.114
Nothing sounded different here.
How long ago was it?

28:17.197 --> 28:18.740
Right at the beginning
of the news.

28:20.784 --> 28:24.079
Are you mad at me?
No, but I don’t know
what you want me to do.

28:24.162 --> 28:27.207
It was probably your radio.
Can you listen to the sound?

28:27.291 --> 28:29.543
Is it the same sound you
heard interrupt my show?
Yeah, mostly.

28:29.626 --> 28:31.587
They came through
on top of each other.
All right. Connect it.

28:31.670 --> 28:33.046
All right.

28:39.970 --> 28:42.264
I’ve never heard that
before.

28:42.347 --> 28:44.183
Yeah, me neither.
And then this lady called.

28:44.266 --> 28:46.351
She said there was something
going on out of town

28:46.435 --> 28:49.688
and she was going down to her
cellar and then that sound
came through on her line.

28:49.771 --> 28:52.733
Then I called Ethel
’cause she’s babysitting Maddy,
and her line got cut.

28:52.816 --> 28:54.484
And when did you say
my show got cut into?

28:54.568 --> 28:56.612
Right at the beginning
of the news.

28:56.695 --> 28:59.448
I didn’t hear it,
but it’s a closed circuit,

28:59.531 --> 29:01.867
so if it went out
from the station,
it’ll be recorded on playback.

29:01.950 --> 29:04.077
So you stay on the line while
I rewind it and play it back,

29:04.161 --> 29:05.329
and I’ll let you know
if I hear anything.

29:05.412 --> 29:08.624
Okay.

29:08.707 --> 29:11.293
This is WOTW radio
in Cayuga, New Mexico,

29:11.376 --> 29:13.045
and this is the news
for the hour.

29:13.128 --> 29:14.796
Boeing has introduced
its new line of...

29:17.424 --> 29:19.092
That was it.

29:19.176 --> 29:20.719
What?
That was it.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.846
It came through
just like that.
I’ll be.

29:22.930 --> 29:26.391
What? Why? Is it bad?
That’s a good question.

29:26.475 --> 29:29.353
If it’s foreign or code,
the Air Force
will be coming to town.

29:29.436 --> 29:31.730
Really?
Oh, yeah.

29:31.813 --> 29:34.191
Will we get in trouble?
We haven’t done anything.

29:34.274 --> 29:35.275
Yeah, that’s true.

29:40.072 --> 29:41.782
Okay, yeah, yeah,
that’s true.

29:43.450 --> 29:45.494
Send me that signal again
and I’ll put it on the air.

29:45.577 --> 29:47.621
If anyone’s listening,
maybe they’ll know something.

29:47.704 --> 29:49.248
And you sure
we won’t get in trouble?

29:49.331 --> 29:50.791
I don’t care.
This is good radio.

29:54.336 --> 29:57.464
Okay, I’m doing it.
Here, I’m sending the signal.

29:57.548 --> 29:59.550
Don’t call me for ten minutes,
unless someone calls in.

29:59.633 --> 30:01.635
I don’t want false alarms.
Watch your clock. Ten minutes.

30:01.718 --> 30:04.012
I understand.
I’ll wait for the calls.
Here you go.

30:07.140 --> 30:09.601
There it was, just like
I said it would be.

30:09.685 --> 30:12.271
That was Gabe Gunton,
followed by "Crazy Waves"
from The Golden Glows.

30:12.354 --> 30:14.898
It’s 7:18 here at WOTW.

30:14.982 --> 30:18.527
Listen up, we got
a quick query for anyone
that wants to take a crack.

30:18.610 --> 30:22.531
We’ve got a sound that
seems to be sort of bouncing
around the valley tonight.

30:22.614 --> 30:24.658
And we’d like
to know your thoughts.
We’re standing by the phones

30:24.741 --> 30:26.743
and we’d love to know
if there’s an old expert

30:26.827 --> 30:29.997
or youth ham operator
we don’t know about that’s
tangling up our antenna.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.040
For the caller who can
help us out and tell us

30:32.124 --> 30:35.210
what the sound is, we’ve got
a free piece of Elvis’s carpet,

30:35.294 --> 30:37.504
pulled directly from
his floor in Memphis.

30:37.588 --> 30:39.715
Lines are open.
Please call
with any information.

33:24.463 --> 33:26.173
Passing off
with a little handoff.

33:26.256 --> 33:28.091
Another little handoff.

33:28.175 --> 33:29.259
And a third one.

33:30.385 --> 33:32.846
And looks like--
Oh, there it is.

33:34.389 --> 33:36.391
He’s gonna get the ball
and take it down the court.

33:36.475 --> 33:40.062
And he’s gonna go
and he’s gonna pass the ball.

33:40.145 --> 33:43.065
Another pass. And looks like
he’s gonna go for the shot.

33:43.148 --> 33:45.150
No. He’s gonna hand it off.
Okay.

33:45.234 --> 33:47.569
Got to--
There’s the shot.
And two more points.

33:47.653 --> 33:49.279
I think he can make it
from anywhere.

33:50.280 --> 33:53.909
Passing off.

33:53.992 --> 33:55.994
There it is.

35:03.395 --> 35:05.272
- We got a caller.
-Put him through.

35:05.355 --> 35:08.525
- He’s from out of town.
He might know something.
-Then put him through. Please.

35:08.609 --> 35:09.985
Sir, we are connecting you now.

35:11.612 --> 35:14.031
Hello, sir.
This is Everett Sloan.
Can you hear me?

35:14.114 --> 35:16.158
Hello, yes. How are you?

35:16.241 --> 35:18.785
I’m good.
Can I get your name?
Yes, my name is Billy.

35:19.828 --> 35:21.705
Billy. Okay.
Thank you, Billy.

35:21.788 --> 35:23.999
And I need to tell you first
we don’t allow any swear words

35:24.082 --> 35:26.877
or inappropriate stories
on the air
or I could lose my job.

35:26.960 --> 35:29.505
I don’t have a delay and I wanna
put you right onto the air,

35:29.588 --> 35:32.132
but I need you to promise me
that we’re safe in doing so.

35:32.216 --> 35:34.468
Of course. I understand.

35:34.551 --> 35:36.720
I don’t swear or talk
like that anyway in my life.

35:36.803 --> 35:38.972
Okay, I’m breaking the rules
to do this, so please, you know,

35:39.056 --> 35:42.142
be honest and ask
if something needs to be
discussed off the air

35:42.226 --> 35:44.186
and I’ll go to a break
or put on a record, all right?

35:44.269 --> 35:45.646
Okay. I can do that.

35:45.729 --> 35:48.148
We are going
on the air here shortly,

35:48.232 --> 35:49.399
in three...

35:50.859 --> 35:52.027
two...

35:53.529 --> 35:54.613
one.

35:56.365 --> 35:58.867
We’re back. Sorry to cut
that last song short,

35:58.951 --> 36:00.953
but we do have a caller here
who may know something.

36:01.036 --> 36:04.122
Now, Billy, would you mind
telling us all what you know?

36:04.206 --> 36:06.208
Yes, I have a story
that might be helpful.

36:06.291 --> 36:09.419
I don’t know, it may not be,
but I’ll go ahead.

36:09.503 --> 36:11.547
All right, Billy.
Well, we’re listening.

36:11.630 --> 36:13.841
Well, so I was,
uh, in the military,

36:13.924 --> 36:16.677
and there were always jobs

36:16.760 --> 36:20.097
and work we didn’t know
anything about.

36:20.180 --> 36:22.432
What do you mean?
I mean
we would get assigned

36:22.516 --> 36:24.935
to places without
knowing where we were,

36:25.018 --> 36:27.312
to do things
none of us understood,

36:27.396 --> 36:29.314
which is normal
in the military.

36:29.398 --> 36:32.150
And one night, I was
woken up by my superior.

36:32.234 --> 36:35.320
He had me get into uniform
and report for duty.

36:35.404 --> 36:39.366
Then a carrier plane landed
and they loaded me up by myself.

36:39.449 --> 36:42.494
We made, uh,
several more stops,
picking up other guys.

36:42.578 --> 36:44.955
Then we, uh, flew
for at least two hours.

36:45.038 --> 36:48.667
And when we landed,
they loaded us up into a bus,

36:48.750 --> 36:51.336
but this one had all
of the windows painted black

36:51.420 --> 36:54.590
so there was no telling
where we were going.

36:54.673 --> 36:58.760
Then when we arrived,
it was, uh, still
desert scrubs and flatlands.

36:58.844 --> 37:01.221
But, uh, there were
tents and tunnels

37:01.305 --> 37:04.349
and underground labs
or test bunkers or something.

37:04.433 --> 37:05.976
And I pretty quickly
got briefed

37:06.059 --> 37:08.437
by some officer
I’d never seen,

37:08.520 --> 37:12.399
and he told us everything
we were seeing was classified

37:12.482 --> 37:14.526
and if we ever spoke about it,

37:14.610 --> 37:18.322
it would endanger America
and they would know.

37:18.405 --> 37:23.160
And we were all sent
to this rocky,
kind of sandy alcove,

37:23.243 --> 37:26.538
and they had us
start digging a square hole

37:26.622 --> 37:28.290
with their
digging machines and such.

37:28.373 --> 37:33.253
And we built walls out of blocks
and a concrete floor and such.

37:33.337 --> 37:35.172
And we built windows
that connected

37:35.255 --> 37:37.508
to a viewing room
and ventilation.

37:37.591 --> 37:40.469
And they had us sleep
in this room filled with cots,

37:40.552 --> 37:43.013
war supplies, all underground.

37:43.096 --> 37:45.557
Then one morning, we woke up
and reported to duty,

37:45.641 --> 37:48.393
and there was something
enormous in that hole,

37:48.477 --> 37:50.229
covered in a tarp.

37:50.312 --> 37:52.231
Wh-- What do you mean?

37:52.314 --> 37:54.399
Uh, it was bigger
than an airplane,

37:54.483 --> 37:57.110
but no one
was allowed to see it.

37:57.194 --> 37:59.321
And there were guards
surrounding it all day.

37:59.404 --> 38:01.240
Well, what’d it look like?

38:01.323 --> 38:03.951
Mostly smooth,
but it looked
broken or damaged,

38:04.034 --> 38:06.578
’cause there were
some rough patches.

38:06.662 --> 38:08.539
You think it was American?

38:08.622 --> 38:10.749
There was no way to know.
Uh--

38:10.832 --> 38:12.668
You don’t ask
anything like that.

38:12.751 --> 38:16.255
We want to know just like
anybody wants to know
about somethin’.

38:16.338 --> 38:19.800
But you trust your superiors
and you follow orders.

38:19.883 --> 38:24.638
But this one...
worried me.

38:25.264 --> 38:26.890
And why is that?

38:26.974 --> 38:29.017
Probably ’cause
it was so secretive.

38:30.644 --> 38:32.980
So what happened next?

38:33.063 --> 38:36.900
Well, we built the ceiling
over this thing, carefully.

38:36.984 --> 38:39.570
And then when they
were done with us,

38:39.653 --> 38:41.905
they got us all
boarded on a plane.

38:41.989 --> 38:44.616
And when the propellers
had started spinning

38:44.700 --> 38:46.743
and we were about to take off,

38:46.827 --> 38:48.787
and the radio started
playing this sound.

38:50.289 --> 38:51.290
What sound?

38:52.666 --> 38:54.710
The same sound
you just played tonight.

38:56.420 --> 38:57.421
You sure it was the same?

38:58.714 --> 38:59.965
Oh, I couldn’t forget it.

39:01.758 --> 39:04.595
And when we finally took off
and I looked out the window,

39:04.678 --> 39:07.931
you could see guys were
starting to cover the airstrip

39:08.015 --> 39:10.475
with dirt, like
we never been there.

39:10.559 --> 39:14.062
And then the sound disappeared
and we got further away.

39:14.146 --> 39:17.524
And when I got back, then I
started getting really sick.

39:17.608 --> 39:19.318
And in the next few weeks,
I developed

39:19.401 --> 39:21.904
some kind
of lung condition.

39:21.987 --> 39:23.906
So now I didn’t breathe so good.

39:23.989 --> 39:27.409
And I think whatever--
that area of the desert

39:27.492 --> 39:29.411
caused it or something.

39:29.494 --> 39:31.038
Maybe radiation.

39:31.121 --> 39:33.582
’Cause I was
always healthy.

39:33.665 --> 39:36.293
Then I got time
at the military hospital.

39:36.376 --> 39:39.171
And then a couple years later,
I saw one of the guys

39:39.254 --> 39:42.341
who had been on that detail
with me in the desert.

39:42.424 --> 39:45.385
And I asked him
if he’d got sick afterwards,

39:45.469 --> 39:47.429
and he said he had.

39:47.513 --> 39:51.517
And then he told me that
that was the second time

39:51.600 --> 39:55.145
he’d been picked up
for something up like that.

39:55.979 --> 39:57.564
And he told me about a night

39:57.648 --> 39:59.816
when he’d been
commissioned in Nevada

39:59.900 --> 40:02.694
and he was taken
to the Colorado River

40:02.778 --> 40:05.197
where there was a river barge

40:05.280 --> 40:08.242
carrying something
twice its size down the river.

40:08.325 --> 40:10.953
And when they got
several hours down the river,

40:11.036 --> 40:12.955
there was a makeshift station,

40:13.038 --> 40:17.751
and they unloaded the cargo
onto two Army trucks.

40:17.835 --> 40:20.087
And when they got done
loading it up,

40:20.170 --> 40:23.340
the same sound we heard
out in the desert

40:23.423 --> 40:28.804
also went through
all of the radios there
on the ground and on the barge.

40:28.887 --> 40:33.642
And then he said
the two Army trucks
drove off into the night

40:33.725 --> 40:35.394
and the sound
faded with them.

40:37.855 --> 40:39.606
So did he know what it was?

40:40.607 --> 40:42.568
No.

40:42.651 --> 40:46.280
But since our
detail in the desert,
he’d asked around

40:46.363 --> 40:49.783
and he’d heard
about another guy
that knew about the noises.

40:49.867 --> 40:53.745
So we met up with him
off-base,

40:54.538 --> 40:56.206
but he only knew pieces.

40:56.290 --> 40:58.458
Everybody only knows pieces
in the military.

40:58.542 --> 41:00.377
Nobody knows
the whole thing.

41:00.460 --> 41:02.379
And that’s
part of the plan.

41:02.462 --> 41:06.633
Which is why
they pieced together teams
from all over the country

41:06.717 --> 41:10.554
and only brought us in
for one task at a time.

41:10.637 --> 41:13.098
So no one would
know everything.

41:13.182 --> 41:16.310
Wait, I’m sorry.
You’re gonna have to be clearer.

41:16.393 --> 41:18.312
Is this sound
a military sound?

41:20.814 --> 41:23.108
That’s what we asked
this guy at Walker.

41:24.359 --> 41:26.195
And what did he say?

41:26.278 --> 41:27.863
He said
it wasn’t military.

41:29.698 --> 41:33.076
It wasn’t military
from any country.

41:33.160 --> 41:36.496
It was coming from
thousands of feet higher
than anything could fly.

41:37.956 --> 41:39.791
How did he know that?

41:39.875 --> 41:43.045
’Cause he was
a radar operator.

41:43.128 --> 41:45.297
So are these signals frequent?
No.

41:45.380 --> 41:47.633
Can I ask-- I’m assuming
this was before Sputnik.

41:47.716 --> 41:50.010
This was
years before Sputnik.

41:50.093 --> 41:51.887
And signals like yours

41:51.970 --> 41:54.097
have been caught
going back and forth.

41:54.181 --> 41:57.434
What do you mean?
Like communication.

41:57.518 --> 42:01.396
Like one says something here
in this part of the sky

42:01.480 --> 42:03.357
and another
says something back.

42:03.440 --> 42:05.984
Sometimes
they were recorded
at Sputnik heights

42:06.068 --> 42:08.862
and sometimes
just a few hundred feet
off the ground.

42:08.946 --> 42:12.741
Where?
Lots of places.
All over.

42:15.744 --> 42:17.454
What do you mean all over?

42:20.290 --> 42:21.291
Billy?

42:22.876 --> 42:25.671
Billy, I--
think we lost you. Billy?

42:27.840 --> 42:30.300
Well, for the five of you
out there listening,
it looks like we lost Billy.

42:30.384 --> 42:33.846
Let me work on getting him
back on the air.
I’m back in a moment.

42:33.929 --> 42:36.723
Fay, what happened?
I don’t know. He got cut.
That’s what’s been happening--

42:36.807 --> 42:38.141
-We gotta get him back.
-I can’t.

42:38.225 --> 42:40.310
-Why not?
-I have no idea where he lives.

42:40.394 --> 42:41.979
Then call the board by Holloman.

42:42.062 --> 42:43.647
We can’t. He probably
gave a fake name or--

42:43.730 --> 42:46.400
-You can’t dial back
out the line?
-It doesn’t work like that.

42:46.483 --> 42:48.735
-Look him up in the phone book.
-Under Billy near Holloman?

42:48.819 --> 42:50.779
Uh-- I know. I know.

42:50.863 --> 42:53.073
Damn it.

42:53.156 --> 42:55.576
Hold on, we got a call,
we got a call!

42:55.659 --> 42:57.744
Name of city, inward.
Alamogordo operator.

42:57.828 --> 42:58.829
Connecting.

43:01.081 --> 43:03.166
Cayuga, number please.
Yes, this is Billy.

43:03.250 --> 43:05.460
I’ll connect you!
Here he is, Everett.

43:05.544 --> 43:08.672
Billy. What’s going on?
We need your real number.

43:08.755 --> 43:10.591
I’m sorry,
but I can’t do that.

43:10.674 --> 43:12.467
Okay, then I can’t
put you back on the air.

43:12.551 --> 43:14.928
I would like to, but there’s
a breach of ethics here,

43:15.012 --> 43:17.514
’cause I have no way of knowing
if what you’re saying is true.

43:17.598 --> 43:19.600
I know. I understand.

43:19.683 --> 43:21.185
I don’t mean
to put you in a place

43:21.268 --> 43:22.603
that would get you
into problems.

43:22.686 --> 43:24.062
Billy, I have to ask--

43:24.146 --> 43:25.314
Why are you
telling us all this?

43:25.397 --> 43:27.524
Is this gonna get us
in trouble?

43:27.608 --> 43:29.985
I suppose I’m telling you
’cause I’m sick.

43:31.612 --> 43:33.197
And I’m old.

43:33.280 --> 43:35.365
And no one listens to us.

43:35.449 --> 43:37.367
And I want people to know
what we did for them.

43:37.451 --> 43:39.661
Why do you think
no one listens to you?

43:39.745 --> 43:42.080
I think part of it’s
’cause I’m black.

43:44.958 --> 43:47.669
I’m sorry
if that’s a problem.
No, I don’t think it is.

43:49.004 --> 43:50.923
I thought
that might be the case.

43:52.424 --> 43:54.718
We’ve just never had
a black caller before.

43:56.929 --> 43:59.765
I’m sorry,
I should have
probably told you that.

43:59.848 --> 44:02.935
But everyone
on these details
were black.

44:03.018 --> 44:05.312
Or Mexican.
All of us doing sweat work.

44:05.395 --> 44:06.939
You think they
did that on purpose?

44:08.232 --> 44:10.150
I know they did.
Why?

44:11.693 --> 44:13.570
’Cause who’s
gonna listen to us?

44:13.654 --> 44:17.866
But there’s
a part of all this
that you can check into

44:17.950 --> 44:20.118
so that you know
I’m not making this up.

44:20.202 --> 44:22.621
Okay, I think we need that,
’cause, you can see why,

44:22.704 --> 44:24.665
at this point,
all we have is your word.

44:24.748 --> 44:27.167
There’s one gentleman
I’ll tell you about
in a minute.

44:27.251 --> 44:29.294
I’m sorry to interrupt, Billy,
but I’m still recording this

44:29.378 --> 44:31.088
even though we’re not
on the air, all right?

44:31.171 --> 44:34.842
Uh, yes, please do.
Okay. Go ahead, Billy.

44:34.925 --> 44:37.344
And so this guy we talked to
at Walker Base,

44:37.427 --> 44:39.888
the radar operator
who we met off-site,

44:39.972 --> 44:43.642
after he retired,
he didn’t stop
with the signals.

44:43.725 --> 44:46.144
In fact, he started
waiting for them

44:46.228 --> 44:49.481
and was trying to record
one of them on his own,

44:49.565 --> 44:53.443
using radio and war surplus
equipment he repaired.

44:53.527 --> 44:55.112
And did he ever get anything?

44:55.195 --> 44:56.488
Yeah, he did.

44:57.573 --> 45:00.450
Finally.
It took a long time,

45:00.534 --> 45:03.495
but one night
he finally got one.

45:03.579 --> 45:05.330
And recorded it.

45:05.414 --> 45:06.790
And then he made copies

45:06.874 --> 45:09.751
and mailed them
to a bunch of us...

45:09.835 --> 45:14.047
guys who had been, uh, around
some of these hidden details.

45:14.131 --> 45:15.757
What did he think
these signals were?

45:17.259 --> 45:20.721
Well, that’s where
you have to make the jump.

45:20.804 --> 45:25.058
Because he told us
it’s something talking

45:25.142 --> 45:27.060
and then disappearing,

45:27.144 --> 45:30.564
something very high
that we can’t see.

45:32.399 --> 45:34.860
And he made copies?
Yes.

45:34.943 --> 45:36.945
And he sent them to us.

45:37.029 --> 45:40.115
Different guys on these details
here in the area.

45:40.199 --> 45:45.829
And when I finally got my tape
and got to a player,
and I played it back...

45:46.914 --> 45:49.374
it made my hair
stand up on end.

45:49.458 --> 45:51.293
Why?

45:51.376 --> 45:53.128
’Cause they were
the same sounds

45:53.212 --> 45:55.088
I’d heard
out in the desert.

45:59.134 --> 46:01.887
Do you still have
that tape?
No.

46:01.970 --> 46:05.182
I didn’t want to be caught
with it, so I burned it.

46:05.265 --> 46:07.643
But one of the other guys,
another Air Force gentleman

46:07.726 --> 46:10.604
who had been on one of
these security details

46:10.687 --> 46:14.191
and heard these noises, too,
and he lives in Cayuga,

46:14.274 --> 46:17.152
so he got sent a tape
just like mine.

46:17.236 --> 46:18.737
That’s what I thought
you were playing.
Wait.

46:18.820 --> 46:20.864
There’s one in Cayuga?
With who?

46:20.948 --> 46:23.242
Raymond Buck,
an ex-Air Force gentleman.

46:23.325 --> 46:25.869
So he was mailed a tape with
one of these signals on it?

46:25.953 --> 46:27.454
But Raymond Buck died.

46:28.997 --> 46:30.791
Oh, no.
Did you say
he passed away?

46:30.874 --> 46:32.251
Yes.

46:34.878 --> 46:36.672
I thought that
may have happened.

46:37.756 --> 46:39.049
I’m sorry, Billy.

46:40.801 --> 46:44.137
Well, I didn’t
know him well, you know.

46:45.764 --> 46:47.891
Do you know where
his tape would be?

46:47.975 --> 46:50.519
No. Maybe if he had kids?

46:50.602 --> 46:52.896
No, Mrs. Buck gave all
his tapes to the library.

46:52.980 --> 46:54.898
There’s not a tape recorder
in the library, Fay.

46:54.982 --> 46:56.775
There is.
It’s in the basement.
They haven’t had a chance

46:56.859 --> 46:58.819
to look at all the tapes,
so they haven’t put it out.

46:58.902 --> 47:00.487
No, the library’s closed and
no one will be at the board.

47:00.571 --> 47:02.281
Everyone’s at the game.
No one’s gonna call.

47:02.364 --> 47:03.907
I know how to get into
the library.

47:06.493 --> 47:10.080
Billy, what do
you think it’ll do
if we can find it and play it?

47:12.332 --> 47:13.375
I don’t know.

47:15.210 --> 47:18.338
But if you’re gonna do it,
you better do it...

47:19.381 --> 47:21.466
’cause something’s
up there now.

47:22.801 --> 47:24.428
And they don’t stay
for long.

47:32.227 --> 47:33.729
Okay, Fay, run.

49:18.500 --> 49:19.501
Get in!

49:19.585 --> 49:22.296
-Did you steal a car?
-Did you get them? No.

49:22.379 --> 49:23.714
Yes. Come on, get in.
Did you get them?

49:23.797 --> 49:25.757
I stole a bicycle!
Answer me.

49:25.841 --> 49:27.301
-Uh, yes, I got them.
-All right.

49:27.384 --> 49:29.720
Whose car is this?
Mr. McKean’s.

49:29.803 --> 49:32.264
Does Mr. McKean know?
Of course not.

49:38.353 --> 49:40.814
Are you gonna give Billy
a piece of Elvis’s carpet?

49:40.898 --> 49:43.025
What?
You said you’d give
the caller who helped us

49:43.108 --> 49:44.568
a piece of Elvis’s carpet.

49:44.651 --> 49:46.195
Oh.

49:49.448 --> 49:51.033
Yeah, no, that’s
not really Elvis’s carpet.

49:51.116 --> 49:52.826
It was, but we gave it
all away a while back.

49:52.910 --> 49:54.995
So now Jack Sage
and Red Gant have both scraps,

49:55.078 --> 49:57.122
and we give away carpet
from Jess Pervis’s house.

49:57.206 --> 49:58.832
Everett, that’s lying.

49:58.916 --> 50:01.001
People really think
that’s Elvis’s carpet.

50:03.670 --> 50:04.671
Shut up, Fay.

50:23.941 --> 50:26.026
Billy? It’s Fay,
the Cayuga operator.

50:26.109 --> 50:27.402
We got a lot of tapes here.

50:27.486 --> 50:28.987
Do you remember
which one it was?

50:29.071 --> 50:30.781
It’s been a long time,

50:30.864 --> 50:32.699
but I think it was clear.

50:33.617 --> 50:34.910
They’re all clear, Billy.

50:36.870 --> 50:37.871
Billy?

50:39.122 --> 50:41.792
The line cut.
What?

50:42.584 --> 50:43.585
Billy?

50:46.088 --> 50:48.006
I can’t reconnect him without
going back to the board.

50:48.090 --> 50:50.551
Yeah, don’t go. Just hand me
those one at a time.

50:50.634 --> 50:51.802
And get out of my chair.

50:55.848 --> 50:57.474
So you don’t believe
Mr. Billy?

50:58.350 --> 50:59.351
I don’t know.

51:02.104 --> 51:05.899
But if there’s something
in the sky, I want to know.

51:08.485 --> 51:10.779
Baxter is a four-year--

51:10.863 --> 51:12.197
No.

51:12.281 --> 51:13.282
Next one.

51:15.200 --> 51:18.078
How you know what
you’re looking for?
I don’t.

51:18.161 --> 51:21.582
Could he have
recorded over it?
Uh, yeah.

51:21.665 --> 51:25.419
Yeah, absolutely.
Unfortunately.

51:29.715 --> 51:31.925
So I did and--

51:35.804 --> 51:38.515
What is that recorder?
This is the Maggie PT-6.

51:38.599 --> 51:41.101
Maggie?
Yeah, for Magnecord.

51:41.185 --> 51:43.312
It’s like the broadcast brother
to your recorder.

51:43.395 --> 51:45.606
It’s how we play
the games and ads.

51:45.689 --> 51:47.608
People really listen
to the games the next day,

51:47.691 --> 51:49.651
even though they
know what happened?
Yeah, they do.

51:49.735 --> 51:52.613
They don’t care they know.
They just wanna hear
their kid’s name on the radio.

51:52.696 --> 51:54.323
♪ Silent night ♪

51:54.406 --> 51:56.950
♪ Holy night-- ♪
That’s not it.

52:00.412 --> 52:02.164
Is any of this gonna
get you in trouble?

52:02.247 --> 52:03.916
Well, if it does,
I don’t care.

52:03.999 --> 52:05.792
This is good radio.

52:05.876 --> 52:07.920
And it’ll get me
a better job somewhere else.

52:10.088 --> 52:13.759
Where would you wanna go?
I don’t know.

52:13.842 --> 52:15.427
At that point...
Probably West Coast.

52:15.511 --> 52:17.471
That’s where everything’s
happening in radio.

52:22.726 --> 52:24.520
I wanna get out, too.

52:24.603 --> 52:27.648
Not till Maddy’s older,
of course, but sometime.

52:29.274 --> 52:32.110
To where? To do what?
Want to go to college?

52:32.194 --> 52:35.906
Eh, probably just to work on
a bigger switchboard somewhere.

52:35.989 --> 52:38.575
Right now, I could work
in a hospital or a hotel

52:38.659 --> 52:40.244
or a school
on their switchboard.

52:40.327 --> 52:42.829
But if I wanna work
on a bigger board,

52:42.913 --> 52:44.373
I’d have to transfer
to a bigger city

52:44.456 --> 52:46.166
and get hired on
by the phone company.

52:46.250 --> 52:49.378
No college?
Can’t afford college, Everett.

52:49.461 --> 52:52.130
There’s loans.
You could look into that.

52:52.881 --> 52:54.091
I’d love that.

53:04.810 --> 53:06.228
Golly Moses.

53:06.311 --> 53:08.146
Oh, Everett.

53:09.147 --> 53:10.148
That’s it.

53:12.025 --> 53:13.402
And it’s clearer.
What are you gonna do?

53:18.282 --> 53:20.450
Folks, we got another sound
we do need your help with.

53:20.534 --> 53:22.536
Listen up and let us know.

53:22.619 --> 53:24.538
And, Billy,
if this is the sound,
give us a call.

53:24.621 --> 53:26.540
All right.
Here it is, cats.

53:45.893 --> 53:47.561
Oh, my gosh.
Everett?

53:47.644 --> 53:49.062
Oh, my gosh.

53:49.146 --> 53:50.480
Are you
playing a trick on me?

53:50.564 --> 53:51.690
I’m not.

53:51.773 --> 53:53.317
Hold still.
What’s going on?

53:53.400 --> 53:55.194
Calm down. There’s
a flashlight somewhere.

53:55.277 --> 53:57.779
What’s going on, Everett?
Hey, Fay, calm down!

53:57.863 --> 53:59.448
Silver flashlight.

54:02.534 --> 54:04.578
I knew it was something.
I knew it. I knew it.

54:04.661 --> 54:06.288
- Fuck.
-What’d you do?

54:06.371 --> 54:08.290
I didn’t do anything!
I don’t know!

54:08.373 --> 54:09.666
There’s lights out here.

54:11.418 --> 54:13.754
We-- Damn it. We just
experienced a blackout
after playing that...

54:13.837 --> 54:16.089
- What are you doing?
-I’m recording for later
in case we got news.

54:16.173 --> 54:18.592
-Why do you change
your voice like that?
-Like what?

54:18.675 --> 54:20.969
When you’re on the radio,
you always change your voice!
Why do you do that?

54:21.053 --> 54:22.679
’Cause that’s
how radio sounds!

54:22.763 --> 54:24.723
Look, I don’t need
your judgment right now.

54:25.849 --> 54:28.227
Oh, no.
Ah, what?

54:28.310 --> 54:30.562
-The switchboard!
-Fay, wait!

54:55.379 --> 54:58.257
Goddamn, Fay!
Get in!

55:01.718 --> 55:03.262
Oh, I shouldn’t have
been gone that long.

55:03.345 --> 55:05.180
Why you always running?
We drove here.

55:05.264 --> 55:08.016
We don’t have a car.
I never ride in cars.
I walk everywhere.

55:10.185 --> 55:11.812
All right, no sweat.

55:16.817 --> 55:18.861
So you still don’t think
something’s going on?

55:20.696 --> 55:22.406
I think if anything’s
happening, it’s that

55:22.489 --> 55:24.616
we’re being spied on
or we’re about to
be invaded.

55:24.700 --> 55:26.159
By who?
Soviets.

55:26.243 --> 55:28.871
You really think so?
100%, absolutely.

55:28.954 --> 55:31.748
And this is exactly
where they’d come in, too,
southern border.

55:47.306 --> 55:48.807
Number please.
Sorry for the wait.

55:50.267 --> 55:51.852
Number please.
I’ll connect you.

55:51.935 --> 55:53.103
Uh, I’m not sure.

55:53.187 --> 55:54.813
No, you’re the first one to--

55:54.897 --> 55:56.315
Yes, we’ll let them know.
Thank you.

55:57.941 --> 56:00.068
Number please. Yes, we’re
notifying highway patrol.

56:00.152 --> 56:01.862
Uh, we’ll relay
any news to you.

56:01.945 --> 56:04.198
-Thank you. Thank you.

56:04.281 --> 56:05.782
Number please.
Sorry for the wait.

56:07.326 --> 56:08.952
All right, thank you.
Goodbye.

56:09.036 --> 56:10.412
Thank you. Goodbye.

56:12.122 --> 56:14.291
People are saying
there’s something in the sky.

56:20.088 --> 56:21.423
It’s 7:45.
Write that down.

56:21.507 --> 56:23.300
Can’t you just record it?
Yeah.

56:23.383 --> 56:25.677
Folks, it is 7:45 p.m.
and we may have something--

56:25.761 --> 56:28.138
-Did you see it?
-Did it cross over? What?

56:28.222 --> 56:30.682
There’s something in the sky.
We followed it from Culp Canyon.

56:30.766 --> 56:32.267
I’m Bertsie. This is Gerrie.

56:32.351 --> 56:33.977
I’m going by Gerald now.
Please call me Gerald.

56:34.061 --> 56:35.145
I forgot. I’m sorry.
I’m Everett. This is Fay.

56:35.229 --> 56:36.647
The power cut off at the radio--

56:36.730 --> 56:37.773
You work at the radio station?

56:37.856 --> 56:39.316
I do Highway Hits.

56:39.399 --> 56:41.693
-Were you listening?
-We drove 80 mph.

56:41.777 --> 56:44.279
It was something in the sky.
He does the old stuff.
I do the hits.

56:44.363 --> 56:46.740
No, we don’t listen to--
I don’t like new stuff,
but Gerrie does.

56:46.823 --> 56:49.076
-Oh.

56:53.622 --> 56:54.623
Number please.

56:56.500 --> 56:59.294
Yes, Everett’s here. Would you
like to speak with him here?

56:59.378 --> 57:01.296
Okay, I’ll connect you.

57:01.380 --> 57:04.800
Everett, come to board one!
There’s a lady calling in
for the station!

57:09.304 --> 57:11.265
Here.

57:11.348 --> 57:13.684
Hello. This is Everett
"the Maverick" Sloan, WOTW.

57:13.767 --> 57:15.769
I can tell you what’s going on.

57:15.853 --> 57:18.063
What do you mean?
I can tell you more

57:18.146 --> 57:20.482
about what that fellow
told you on the radio

57:20.566 --> 57:22.901
and give you more
for your radio show.

57:22.985 --> 57:24.820
Okay, go ahead.
No.

57:24.903 --> 57:27.155
I would prefer you
to come to my house.

57:27.239 --> 57:28.907
I would like to tell you here.

57:28.991 --> 57:30.576
There’s something
in the sky, ma’am.

57:30.659 --> 57:32.452
I know.

57:32.536 --> 57:35.080
That’s what I want
to talk to you about.

57:35.163 --> 57:37.624
I can tell you a lot more
than you know right now

57:37.708 --> 57:38.709
if you come here.

57:40.544 --> 57:43.922
I think what I can tell you
would be very important tonight.

57:44.006 --> 57:47.467
All right,
what’s your address?
1616 Sycamore.

57:47.551 --> 57:49.761
Sixteen-si-- All right.
You’ll need to get a key

57:49.845 --> 57:52.014
from the flowerpot
on the front porch.

57:52.097 --> 57:54.600
I leave it there for the boy
that brings me groceries.

57:54.683 --> 57:56.560
I won’t be able
to come the door.

57:56.643 --> 57:59.771
I can’t walk much anymore.
But I’ll be here.

57:59.855 --> 58:01.690
All right, I’ll be there
in one or two minutes.

58:01.773 --> 58:03.942
Uh, what’s your name?
Mabel Blanche.

58:04.026 --> 58:06.278
Okay, Mrs. Blanche,
we’ll see you shortly. Bye-bye.

58:06.361 --> 58:08.989
She said she can tell us
what’s going on. Come on.

58:09.072 --> 58:10.657
I told her we’d be
there in a minute.
Who?

58:10.741 --> 58:12.743
This old lady caller said
she can tell us
what’s going on.

58:12.826 --> 58:14.536
You know her?
What’s she gonna tell you?
No, I don’t.

58:14.620 --> 58:16.830
She said come immediately.
To tell you what?

58:16.914 --> 58:19.208
-How do you know
she’s not crazy?
-I don’t. She could be.

58:19.291 --> 58:21.210
But she sounded fine.
It’s one minute,
down Ayers, on Sycamore.

58:21.293 --> 58:23.754
-We’re gonna stay here.
-Will you find us
if you see anything?

58:23.837 --> 58:25.714
Yes. Will you find us
if you learn anything?
Yes, I will.

58:25.797 --> 58:27.549
Her line’s there.
You can turn the key--

58:27.633 --> 58:29.218
I don’t know a frog’s ribbit
about those things.

58:29.301 --> 58:30.802
Okay, never mind.

58:37.351 --> 58:40.145
What in the world, Fay?
I don’t know.
She never calls in at night.

58:40.229 --> 58:41.813
She’s a shut-in.
This could be news.

58:41.897 --> 58:44.024
You really think so?
I really do.

58:44.107 --> 58:46.777
Should I have brought
my tape recorder?
No, this one’s better.

58:46.860 --> 58:48.862
Mine not good enough?
It’s--

58:48.946 --> 58:50.864
No, it’s fine, but it’s
not broadcast quality.

58:50.948 --> 58:52.699
It’s good,
but it’s more like a toy.

58:52.783 --> 58:54.159
I don’t mean that in a way
to get your feelings hurt.

58:54.243 --> 58:55.369
You won’t hurt my feelings.
Good.

58:55.452 --> 58:57.454
’Cause I hurt
girls’ feelings a lot.

58:59.665 --> 59:01.166
Don’t be a jerk all the time,
probably won’t hurt--

59:01.250 --> 59:03.043
You are on the stick
with me tonight!

59:16.557 --> 59:18.141
Wait up.
No, you hurry up.

59:25.315 --> 59:27.109
Okay.

59:45.502 --> 59:46.920
I’m back here.

1:00:16.783 --> 1:00:19.203
Who is she?
Uh, this is Fay.

1:00:19.286 --> 1:00:20.996
I’m Everett.
She’s the switchboard operator.

1:00:21.079 --> 1:00:23.415
She’s my friend.
Is that okay?

1:00:23.498 --> 1:00:24.708
Yes, that’s fine.

1:00:27.544 --> 1:00:28.670
You can sit down.

1:00:32.883 --> 1:00:35.636
You’re the one on the phone?
Yes.

1:00:35.719 --> 1:00:37.137
How old are you, sweetie?

1:00:37.221 --> 1:00:39.973
Sixteen.
Who are your parents?

1:00:40.057 --> 1:00:43.477
Oh, well, I don’t have
a dad, but, uh,
my mom is Yodi Crocker.

1:00:43.560 --> 1:00:46.605
Can I ask
what you were saying
while we were walking in?

1:00:46.688 --> 1:00:48.774
That was very alarming.

1:00:48.857 --> 1:00:50.901
I know it was.

1:00:50.984 --> 1:00:53.070
I’m sorry.

1:00:53.153 --> 1:00:55.697
I will explain myself.

1:00:55.781 --> 1:00:57.824
I’m not some witch,
I promise.

1:00:57.908 --> 1:01:01.870
Do you mind if we tell people
what you tell us on the radio?

1:01:01.954 --> 1:01:03.914
That’s why I’m telling you.

1:01:03.997 --> 1:01:06.458
And can we record you,
in case this is a news story?

1:01:06.542 --> 1:01:08.377
Of course.

1:01:08.460 --> 1:01:10.879
I hope we will be
a news story.

1:01:11.922 --> 1:01:15.008
I’ve been waiting
my whole life for this.

1:01:16.635 --> 1:01:18.846
Okay, thank you.

1:01:18.929 --> 1:01:21.807
Uh, also, uh,
we wanna hear everything
you have to tell us,

1:01:21.890 --> 1:01:23.684
but we have a very short
amount of time.

1:01:23.767 --> 1:01:26.144
So if we have to--
I understand.

1:01:26.228 --> 1:01:27.980
Then let me get right to it.

1:01:29.273 --> 1:01:32.943
I listen to your broadcast,
every night.

1:01:33.026 --> 1:01:36.405
I think you’re very good,
and I hope you can
get far away from here.

1:01:36.488 --> 1:01:38.198
Thank you.

1:01:38.282 --> 1:01:40.534
I will tell you
what is happening,

1:01:40.617 --> 1:01:43.495
but I will have
one request for you
when I have finished.

1:01:43.579 --> 1:01:45.289
Okay.
I’ll do whatever I can.

1:01:46.874 --> 1:01:48.500
The gentleman
that called in--

1:01:49.835 --> 1:01:51.920
I believe his stories,

1:01:52.004 --> 1:01:54.756
because I have
a companion story to his.

1:01:55.883 --> 1:01:57.759
It started
before his stories.

1:01:59.094 --> 1:02:01.972
They’ve come here before.

1:02:02.055 --> 1:02:05.142
And now that these things
are happening more often,

1:02:05.225 --> 1:02:09.062
we have a better idea
of what might be out there.

1:02:09.146 --> 1:02:12.191
Ever since I was a little girl,
they’ve liked this place.

1:02:13.483 --> 1:02:15.485
They always have.

1:02:15.569 --> 1:02:17.154
Who?

1:02:17.237 --> 1:02:19.281
The people in the sky.

1:02:22.326 --> 1:02:25.204
So you truly believe that?

1:02:25.287 --> 1:02:28.832
I don’t have to
truly believe it.
It’s just the truth.

1:02:28.916 --> 1:02:31.168
-And can you tell me why?
-Yes, I can.

1:02:33.170 --> 1:02:35.797
Have you ever heard
about the Boles Acres Raid?

1:02:35.881 --> 1:02:37.716
No.

1:02:37.799 --> 1:02:40.761
Well,
when I was still little,

1:02:40.844 --> 1:02:43.889
they finished
the Alamogordo-El Paso
rail line.

1:02:45.349 --> 1:02:51.146
And one day, a passenger train
coasted to a stop outside town.

1:02:51.230 --> 1:02:55.234
When the deputies got there,
it was completely empty.

1:02:55.317 --> 1:02:57.236
Everyone assumed
the Apaches took them,

1:02:57.319 --> 1:02:59.404
so they called it
the Boles Acres Raid.

1:03:00.989 --> 1:03:02.157
But a few days later...

1:03:03.367 --> 1:03:05.452
a beat-up young lady
came into town

1:03:05.536 --> 1:03:07.955
who had jumped
off that train.

1:03:08.038 --> 1:03:10.624
Out in the brush-- She’d been
hiding out there somewhere.

1:03:11.667 --> 1:03:14.211
She was dehydrated
and wouldn’t talk.

1:03:16.547 --> 1:03:19.091
My friend Charlotte’s family
took her in.

1:03:19.174 --> 1:03:23.220
They fed her,
gave her a bed,
Charlotte’s bed actually,

1:03:23.303 --> 1:03:25.848
and they telegraphed someone
in El Paso to come get her

1:03:25.931 --> 1:03:27.474
so they could get
some answers.

1:03:29.017 --> 1:03:31.186
Charlotte’s dad was
the Methodist minister.

1:03:31.270 --> 1:03:33.355
Batsell Breff.
He started the church here.

1:03:35.274 --> 1:03:38.277
My-- My parents died
when I was little,

1:03:38.360 --> 1:03:41.238
so I lived
many weeks of the year

1:03:41.321 --> 1:03:43.198
with Charlotte’s family.

1:03:43.282 --> 1:03:44.783
When my brothers
and sisters were working

1:03:44.867 --> 1:03:46.410
or had too many mouths
to feed.

1:03:48.412 --> 1:03:49.580
But that night...

1:03:51.957 --> 1:03:54.168
that woman from the train
started muttering

1:03:54.251 --> 1:03:56.879
something in her sleep,
in Charlotte’s room.

1:03:58.172 --> 1:04:00.883
It wasn’t English
or Spanish or Indian.

1:04:02.342 --> 1:04:05.804
So we opened the door
a crack to listen.

1:04:07.931 --> 1:04:11.727
We’d never heard it before,
but I remembered it.

1:04:13.896 --> 1:04:15.606
And then,
before the next day,
she disappeared,

1:04:15.689 --> 1:04:19.276
crawled out the window
and stole a horse,
believe it or not.

1:04:19.359 --> 1:04:22.196
So if you ever hear
about the old horse witch,

1:04:22.279 --> 1:04:24.281
that’s where
the story came from.

1:04:26.575 --> 1:04:28.327
My older sister raised me.

1:04:29.369 --> 1:04:31.747
But mostly I lived alone.

1:04:31.830 --> 1:04:34.791
I made dresses and tablecloths
and what have you.

1:04:36.919 --> 1:04:40.172
I was still young
when I met Claude Maynard.

1:04:40.255 --> 1:04:42.758
He was part of the crew
putting telephone lines in.

1:04:44.218 --> 1:04:46.637
We fell in love,

1:04:46.720 --> 1:04:51.391
and I conceived
my son with him
without being married.

1:04:51.475 --> 1:04:54.436
I actually didn’t know that
was how you made a baby,
believe it or not.

1:04:56.313 --> 1:04:58.815
He said he’d come back
when he finished work
in White Sands,

1:04:58.899 --> 1:05:00.484
and I believed him,

1:05:00.567 --> 1:05:02.152
but he never did.

1:05:04.696 --> 1:05:06.990
When my baby was born,
I named him Hollis.

1:05:08.992 --> 1:05:11.411
A few people were
kind to me, but...

1:05:11.495 --> 1:05:14.206
mostly I was
on my own with him.

1:05:14.289 --> 1:05:18.335
This wasn’t a neighborhood
or a town like it is today.

1:05:18.418 --> 1:05:21.296
It was scattered houses
around the buildings
on Ayers.

1:05:22.548 --> 1:05:24.925
I was a lonely mother,
but I did my best.

1:05:27.302 --> 1:05:31.723
And later on, I heard Claude
had died stringing up lights

1:05:31.807 --> 1:05:35.060
in a cave in Texas
for a tourist operation.

1:05:36.770 --> 1:05:38.313
Of course,
that broke my heart.

1:05:40.023 --> 1:05:42.359
But to get back to when
Hollis was still a baby.

1:05:45.237 --> 1:05:49.074
One night,
after I’d nursed him,
he was asleep in my arms,

1:05:49.157 --> 1:05:51.410
and he started making
the sounds of an infant.

1:05:52.828 --> 1:05:54.246
And then
they became clearer.

1:05:55.205 --> 1:05:56.206
More vocal.

1:05:57.916 --> 1:06:00.961
And then he spoke
his first words.

1:06:01.044 --> 1:06:04.882
And the same words
I heard come from that
confused woman at Charlotte’s

1:06:04.965 --> 1:06:08.343
started coming from
the mouth of my ten-month-old
in his sleep.

1:06:10.095 --> 1:06:12.472
I tried to tell
a few people.

1:06:12.556 --> 1:06:14.308
I went to a doctor
in another town.

1:06:14.391 --> 1:06:17.603
He said it was baby noises
and I shouldn’t
tell anyone else.

1:06:19.813 --> 1:06:21.565
Hollis always
behaved differently.

1:06:23.692 --> 1:06:25.819
He fixated on objects.

1:06:27.154 --> 1:06:28.197
He wouldn’t hear you.

1:06:29.406 --> 1:06:32.159
And in his sleep,
occasionally I would hear him...

1:06:33.535 --> 1:06:35.370
say those words.

1:06:37.372 --> 1:06:38.707
So I wrote them down.

1:06:40.459 --> 1:06:42.503
Word for word.

1:06:44.087 --> 1:06:47.508
I asked him about it,
but... he didn’t know.

1:06:48.926 --> 1:06:49.927
He didn’t know.

1:06:52.763 --> 1:06:56.767
And one night, when he was
about four years old...

1:06:58.227 --> 1:06:59.978
it got really windy outside.

1:07:03.899 --> 1:07:07.945
And there was a sound,
like a really large windmill.

1:07:10.447 --> 1:07:12.324
And Hollis set his gaze
on the window.

1:07:13.951 --> 1:07:15.160
And he wouldn’t respond.

1:07:17.579 --> 1:07:20.958
So I... read
the muttering to him.

1:07:22.251 --> 1:07:25.337
And his eyes closed
and he looked up
at the ceiling

1:07:26.213 --> 1:07:28.006
and he didn’t move.

1:07:28.090 --> 1:07:29.842
And then his lips
moved with mine.

1:07:33.053 --> 1:07:34.930
And a few moments
after I stopped...

1:07:37.015 --> 1:07:38.976
he opened his eyes
and went back to playing.

1:07:41.979 --> 1:07:44.606
I tried it again
a few days later,
but nothing.

1:07:45.941 --> 1:07:47.943
So I figured

1:07:48.026 --> 1:07:50.904
there must be something
out there on those nights,

1:07:50.988 --> 1:07:53.365
telling him something
that no one can hear.

1:07:54.992 --> 1:07:57.828
Radio was pretty new,
and that’s what
I thought it was.

1:07:58.829 --> 1:08:00.914
Or something
from the occult.

1:08:02.916 --> 1:08:05.669
And then when he was nine,

1:08:05.752 --> 1:08:08.088
I got the feeling
that something
was out there again.

1:08:09.756 --> 1:08:13.260
And that night,
in the middle of the night,

1:08:13.343 --> 1:08:17.181
he walked out the front door
of this house and vanished.

1:08:19.975 --> 1:08:21.685
How?

1:08:21.768 --> 1:08:23.562
He was taken up
from this Earth.

1:08:24.688 --> 1:08:27.858
There were no other houses.
It was very dry.

1:08:27.941 --> 1:08:30.861
I followed his footprints
out the front door...

1:08:31.862 --> 1:08:33.822
out to about 150 feet...

1:08:34.823 --> 1:08:36.950
and they stopped
there in the dirt.

1:08:38.076 --> 1:08:39.953
And he wasn’t there.

1:08:41.538 --> 1:08:43.165
They took my son...

1:08:44.416 --> 1:08:47.085
and no one
has ever believed me.

1:08:47.169 --> 1:08:50.339
Was there an investigation?
Of course.

1:08:50.422 --> 1:08:54.301
But the whole thing turned
to an investigation of me.

1:08:56.094 --> 1:08:59.431
People were convinced that
my son had ruined my life...

1:09:00.557 --> 1:09:02.142
so I killed him.

1:09:04.853 --> 1:09:09.441
So did you recognize the sound
we played on the radio tonight?

1:09:09.525 --> 1:09:11.485
No.

1:09:11.568 --> 1:09:14.947
But I believe I know
what is going on.

1:09:15.030 --> 1:09:16.490
Can you tell me what that is?

1:09:17.908 --> 1:09:20.410
I believe they’re
up there tonight.

1:09:20.494 --> 1:09:22.579
Right now.

1:09:22.663 --> 1:09:25.415
And I think
there are some reasons
to support that idea.

1:09:25.499 --> 1:09:27.167
Like what?

1:09:27.251 --> 1:09:30.295
I think they stay away
from big cities.

1:09:30.379 --> 1:09:34.424
I think they wait
for people to get together
in one place, like tonight,

1:09:34.508 --> 1:09:36.218
and when everyone
gets out of that game,

1:09:36.301 --> 1:09:37.803
they’re going to be gone.

1:09:39.888 --> 1:09:41.598
I think
they like people alone.

1:09:43.058 --> 1:09:45.686
Mmm. And I think
they talk to people

1:09:45.769 --> 1:09:48.272
with some kind of
advanced radio,
in their sleep.

1:09:48.355 --> 1:09:51.191
Right, like you think
they did with your son?

1:09:51.275 --> 1:09:53.277
I didn’t just think this up.

1:09:56.405 --> 1:10:00.659
I think,
at the lowest level,
they send people on errands.

1:10:00.742 --> 1:10:02.452
They play
with people’s minds.

1:10:04.621 --> 1:10:06.915
They sway people
to do things

1:10:06.999 --> 1:10:11.253
and think certain ways
so that we stay in conflict,

1:10:11.336 --> 1:10:12.629
focused on ourself.

1:10:13.922 --> 1:10:16.175
So that we’re always

1:10:16.258 --> 1:10:19.178
cleaning house or losing weight
or dressing up for other people.

1:10:19.261 --> 1:10:22.431
I think they get inside
our heads and make us do
destructive things,

1:10:22.514 --> 1:10:24.057
like drink and overeat.

1:10:24.141 --> 1:10:27.936
I’ve seen good people go bad
and smart people go mad.

1:10:30.355 --> 1:10:32.566
I think,
at the highest level,
they do things

1:10:32.649 --> 1:10:35.277
that cause nations
to go to war.

1:10:35.360 --> 1:10:36.945
Things that make no sense.

1:10:39.323 --> 1:10:43.744
And I think no one knows
they’re being affected.

1:10:45.245 --> 1:10:49.333
We all work out other reasons
to justify our actions.

1:10:50.501 --> 1:10:54.546
But free will isn’t possible
with them up there.

1:10:58.926 --> 1:11:01.470
I’ve had an entire life
to think about this.

1:11:02.804 --> 1:11:03.972
Years alone.

1:11:05.516 --> 1:11:06.850
And that’s what I think.

1:11:11.230 --> 1:11:13.774
Well, I’m sorry about everything
that’s happened in your life

1:11:13.857 --> 1:11:15.901
to lead you to these ideas.

1:11:17.569 --> 1:11:19.571
Thank you.

1:11:19.655 --> 1:11:21.615
Like I said in the beginning,
we don’t want to offend you,

1:11:21.698 --> 1:11:24.243
-but we do have to
kind of get going.
-I know.

1:11:25.410 --> 1:11:28.163
But I did have
a request for you.

1:11:28.247 --> 1:11:29.248
Of course.

1:11:31.333 --> 1:11:32.918
I want you
to take me with you.

1:11:35.796 --> 1:11:37.840
-Take you with us?
-Yes. Right now.

1:11:37.923 --> 1:11:40.717
I’m sorry.
Uh, where do you
want us to take you?

1:11:40.801 --> 1:11:42.302
To the ship.

1:11:44.304 --> 1:11:46.139
I want to see my son.

1:11:47.891 --> 1:11:50.602
I know he’s here tonight.

1:11:50.686 --> 1:11:52.479
Up there.

1:11:52.563 --> 1:11:55.023
And I want you to take me
to the ship.

1:12:03.490 --> 1:12:05.367
Fay, let’s go.

1:12:05.450 --> 1:12:07.995
-Now.
-Wait.

1:12:16.753 --> 1:12:18.297
Take this.

1:12:21.300 --> 1:12:26.138
Say this when you
encounter people tonight.

1:12:45.282 --> 1:12:49.119
We’ve got to find a camera
or something. My friend
Gretchen’s dad has one.

1:12:49.203 --> 1:12:52.539
Fay, I don’t think there’s
really anything up there,
not like she’s talking about.

1:12:52.623 --> 1:12:54.082
Everett.
What? What?

1:12:54.166 --> 1:12:56.001
I forgot about
Ethel and Maddy.

1:12:56.084 --> 1:12:57.294
Wait. Fay, what?

1:13:15.479 --> 1:13:17.523
Ethel? Ethel?

1:13:18.482 --> 1:13:20.108
Maddy.
Come here, come here.

1:13:20.192 --> 1:13:21.902
It’s okay. Sissy’s got you.

1:13:21.985 --> 1:13:23.320
Come on, let’s go.

1:13:23.403 --> 1:13:25.113
It’s gonna be okay.
Come on.

1:13:25.781 --> 1:13:27.741
We’re okay. Let’s go.

1:13:40.170 --> 1:13:43.048
Gretchen? Gretchen, I’m gonna
need your dad’s camera.

1:13:43.131 --> 1:13:45.425
What’s going on?
Is everything okay?
Here, take her. I don’t know.

1:13:45.509 --> 1:13:46.969
Were you listening
to the radio at all?

1:13:47.052 --> 1:13:48.762
-Who’s at the switchboard?
-No one. I left.

1:13:48.846 --> 1:13:51.557
Why are you out of breath?
Something’s going on.

1:13:51.640 --> 1:13:53.308
It might be an emergency.
I need the camera.

1:13:53.392 --> 1:13:54.935
You’re gonna get me
in trouble.

1:13:55.018 --> 1:13:56.562
Have you heard from Ethel?
She’s not home.

1:13:56.645 --> 1:13:57.938
She was babysitting
Maddy, and I called--

1:13:58.021 --> 1:13:59.147
I don’t know.
I haven’t seen her.

1:13:59.231 --> 1:14:01.358
I called
and the line got cut.

1:14:01.441 --> 1:14:02.818
Fay! Damn it!

1:14:02.901 --> 1:14:04.444
Who’s that?
It’s Everett.

1:14:04.528 --> 1:14:07.865
Everett, the radio boy?
Yes. Stop smiling.

1:14:07.948 --> 1:14:09.700
What’s he doing here?
He’s helping me.

1:14:09.783 --> 1:14:12.077
Stop smiling.
Goddamn, Fay!

1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:13.829
What are you doing inside?
I’m in my nightgown.

1:14:13.912 --> 1:14:15.289
I’m not looking, Gretchen,
and I don’t care

1:14:15.372 --> 1:14:16.540
what you look like
in your nightgown.

1:14:18.584 --> 1:14:20.669
-Okay, let’s go.
-You can’t bring her.

1:14:20.752 --> 1:14:23.172
You can’t take the camera.
Go ask my dad at the game.

1:14:23.255 --> 1:14:24.923
There’s no time.
This is an emergency.

1:14:25.883 --> 1:14:27.384
What is?
What’s going on?

1:14:27.467 --> 1:14:31.221
There’s something in the sky.
Stay in the house.

1:14:31.305 --> 1:14:33.307
We don’t know that.
You can’t go
telling people that.

1:14:33.390 --> 1:14:35.767
You’re gonna start a panic.
Everybody’s at the game,

1:14:35.851 --> 1:14:37.936
and she sure can’t call anybody,
so stop telling me what to do

1:14:38.020 --> 1:14:40.647
and go find
the couple from Culp Canyon.
All right. No sweat.

1:14:40.731 --> 1:14:43.609
Why do you have your sister?
Ethel’s not there. She was
supposed to be babysitting.

1:14:43.692 --> 1:14:45.736
Well, where is she?
I don’t know.

1:14:45.819 --> 1:14:47.362
Is that camera gonna work?

1:14:47.446 --> 1:14:50.407
Yes, I can make it work.
I’ve used it before.

1:14:50.490 --> 1:14:52.784
Think the radio’s still down?
Oh, there’s no telling.

1:15:06.215 --> 1:15:07.674
Ethel!
Fay, do you have Maddy?

1:15:07.758 --> 1:15:09.760
Yes! Where were you?
Gabe came by--

1:15:09.843 --> 1:15:11.929
God, you’re with Gabe?
What were you thinking?

1:15:12.012 --> 1:15:15.307
We were on his roof.
There’s something in the sky.
Have you seen it?

1:15:18.769 --> 1:15:21.021
-No. What’d you see?
-Get in! It’s outside of town!

1:15:21.104 --> 1:15:23.357
-Come on, come on, come on!
-Fay, come on!

1:15:25.067 --> 1:15:26.777
Come on, come on! Get in!

1:15:26.860 --> 1:15:29.321
-Stay inside the house!
- Fay, come on!

1:15:29.404 --> 1:15:31.740
Ethel said Gabe came over
and they got on the roof

1:15:31.823 --> 1:15:34.326
and saw something in the sky!
Who saw what?

1:15:34.409 --> 1:15:35.827
Get in.
Did you get the camera?

1:15:35.911 --> 1:15:37.829
Who saw what?
My cousin Ethel--

1:15:37.913 --> 1:15:40.040
she was babysitting,
so they got up on the roof.

1:15:40.123 --> 1:15:42.584
-They saw something in the sky.
-Where? What did it look like?

1:15:49.049 --> 1:15:50.968
She said it was round.

1:15:52.427 --> 1:15:54.096
Hiding in the clouds.

1:16:01.770 --> 1:16:03.772
What did you find out
from the old woman?

1:16:05.315 --> 1:16:06.900
She said they’re up there.

1:16:09.778 --> 1:16:11.446
The people in the sky.

1:16:14.074 --> 1:16:17.202
Yeah, they have advanced radio
and communication.

1:16:19.538 --> 1:16:20.831
And they take people up.

1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.127
For real?
That’s what she said?

1:16:25.794 --> 1:16:26.879
Exactly.

1:16:28.005 --> 1:16:30.257
Matter of fact,
she read us this--

1:16:30.340 --> 1:16:31.967
Uh, hold on.

1:16:37.139 --> 1:16:39.683
...I’d nursed him,
he was asleep in my arms--

1:16:48.275 --> 1:16:49.860
...when I was little,

1:16:49.943 --> 1:16:53.113
- so I lived...

1:16:57.993 --> 1:16:59.328
I’m back here.

1:17:29.149 --> 1:17:30.567
Everett, stop the tape.
Stop the tape!

1:17:30.651 --> 1:17:33.195
Okay, okay. Gerald?

1:17:33.278 --> 1:17:35.197
-Gerald? Hey.

1:17:35.280 --> 1:17:37.241
-Everett, take the wheel!
I’ve got Maddy!

1:17:37.324 --> 1:17:39.243
-Gerald, wake up, man! Gerald!

1:17:39.326 --> 1:17:41.370
-Gerald!
-Gerald!

1:17:44.623 --> 1:17:46.708
- Gerald!

1:17:46.792 --> 1:17:49.545
I want out! Okay?

1:17:49.628 --> 1:17:51.004
- Slow down!
- Hold on!

1:17:51.088 --> 1:17:52.756
No!
Let me out now, please!

1:17:59.388 --> 1:18:01.139
I’m so sorry.
Let me out of here!

1:18:01.223 --> 1:18:02.683
I want to go home!
Come on. Please go!

1:18:02.766 --> 1:18:05.435
- Please leave us be!
- I’m so sorry.

1:18:05.519 --> 1:18:07.354
Come back here
so we can take you home!

1:18:07.437 --> 1:18:10.023
-There are rattlesnakes!
-Please go! Please!

1:18:28.292 --> 1:18:30.210
I’m right here, Fay.
I’m right here.

1:18:34.339 --> 1:18:37.050
It’s fine.

1:18:56.445 --> 1:18:57.446
What is it?

1:19:00.490 --> 1:19:01.950
It’s burnt.

1:19:07.497 --> 1:19:09.208
Trees are burnt, too.

1:19:38.237 --> 1:19:39.821
Oh, my gosh.

1:19:45.619 --> 1:19:47.454
Oh, no.

1:19:52.209 --> 1:19:53.544
They’re here.

1:19:55.838 --> 1:19:57.422
They’re really here.

1:20:51.977 --> 1:20:53.520
Do you think
they’re in the forest?

1:20:54.438 --> 1:20:55.856
I don’t know.

1:21:11.788 --> 1:21:15.292
Everett, please don’t.

1:21:18.378 --> 1:21:19.880
Everett.

1:21:21.298 --> 1:21:23.926
Please. Don’t.
