WEBVTT

00:12.120 --> 00:13.634
In here.

00:20.080 --> 00:23.073
It's just the prototype,
but it's fully functional.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.072
It can be scaled up
for any population...

00:25.240 --> 00:26.959
...into the millions.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.672
This is gonna make you
an incredibly rich man.

00:57.160 --> 00:58.355
For your own protection...

00:58.520 --> 01:01.160
...I'm gonna need anyone
intimately familiar with this...

01:01.320 --> 01:02.834
...to sign a non-disclosure.

01:03.040 --> 01:04.554
I've only shown my wife.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.156
Well, then...

01:06.720 --> 01:09.519
...I guess there's nothing left to do...

01:10.120 --> 01:11.395
...but celebrate.

01:12.160 --> 01:13.958
Here's to a better future.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.310
The paralytic you've just consumed...

01:31.520 --> 01:33.398
...is proprietary as well.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.876
It was discovered accidentally...

01:36.080 --> 01:40.916
...during development
of an ADD medication.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.434
Paralysis was an unwanted side effect.

01:57.760 --> 02:01.640
It must feel amazing, dying knowing
you invented something...

02:01.840 --> 02:04.036
...that will change the world.

02:36.400 --> 02:37.993
Honest to God,
third time this month?

02:38.160 --> 02:40.356
My fifth grader's
more punctual than you.

02:40.560 --> 02:41.710
This won't go unnoticed by HR.

02:41.880 --> 02:44.270
This'll be reflected
in your performance review.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.272
One to ten, please.

02:46.440 --> 02:49.558
Nobody's gotten a minus before,
but they broke the mold with you.

02:51.640 --> 02:54.235
Dust off your shoulders.
You got dandruff everywhere.

03:08.360 --> 03:09.999
There's gotta be something
I can do.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.839
- There isn't.
- It's not just Agnes.

03:12.040 --> 03:14.157
It's Liz, it's Kirk.
He's telling her things.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.913
Things about her past, you know?

03:16.080 --> 03:18.390
And I think she's starting to trust him.

03:18.560 --> 03:20.074
We're doing everything we can.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.038
- You gotta understand that.
- I do.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.232
But there's gotta be a lead
I can run down.

03:24.440 --> 03:27.751
- I told you...
- Or a dead end I can revisit, please.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.236
Please.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.040
The Kremlin hates Kirk
just as much as we do.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.436
I reached out
to the D.C. station chief...

03:38.600 --> 03:41.877
<i>...to take a look at their intel.
Got a big fat nyet.</i>

03:42.200 --> 03:44.715
If you want to revisit that dead end,
be my guest.

03:44.880 --> 03:48.590
Maybe your methods
will be a bit more persuasive.

03:48.760 --> 03:50.114
The station chief, who is he?

03:50.440 --> 03:52.591
<i>Vasily Komarov, a cultural attachÃ©...</i>

03:52.800 --> 03:55.395
<i>...at the Russian Embassy.
It's a cover allowing him...</i>

03:55.600 --> 03:58.798
<i>...to run U.S. operations for the SVR
under diplomatic immunity.</i>

03:58.960 --> 04:00.679
<i>- Vices?
- None that we know of.</i>

04:00.880 --> 04:02.712
<i>Trust me, we looked.</i>

04:02.880 --> 04:05.156
- Thank you.
- For what?

04:05.800 --> 04:07.712
This conversation never happened.

04:07.920 --> 04:09.036
Conversation about what?

04:09.760 --> 04:13.834
He sicced me on the SVR for intel
on Kirk. Not behind your back.

04:14.040 --> 04:16.077
- I was gonna tell you...
- You don't have to apologize...

04:16.240 --> 04:17.959
...for trying to find our daughter.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.914
I know you think he won't hurt her
or you can draw him out...

04:21.079 --> 04:24.357
Agnes is missing because
of Kirk's obsession with me.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.431
If I were you
and our daughter were missing...

04:31.600 --> 04:34.638
...because of something
that had nothing to do with me...

04:36.240 --> 04:38.835
What I believe is that we should
do everything we can...

04:39.000 --> 04:40.957
...to bring our daughter home.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.520
- I'll call you if I get anywhere.
- Not if.

04:45.760 --> 04:46.830
When.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.672
The doctor has been baptized...

04:59.880 --> 05:01.792
...and is ready
to make his confession.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.317
I'm getting hitched on the 16th.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.119
Wee Chapel at the casino.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.959
Extend the invite to Mr. Kaplan.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.031
As Alexander Kirk's hematologist...

05:18.200 --> 05:21.432
...I assume you
oversee his transfusions...

05:21.600 --> 05:24.877
...and coordinate with his specialists.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.440
I want to know how it works...

05:26.600 --> 05:29.354
...where you meet,
with whom, and when.

05:29.560 --> 05:31.358
Please.

05:31.680 --> 05:33.558
He's a sick man.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.038
Perhaps another go
with the candiru fish.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.311
I understand they burrow...

05:38.560 --> 05:40.711
...into the most impossible
nooks and crannies.

05:40.880 --> 05:41.996
All right, I...

05:44.200 --> 05:46.635
I give him blood transfusions
once a month...

05:46.960 --> 05:50.715
...and weekly
erythropoietin injections.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.236
When did you last see him?

05:53.800 --> 05:54.836
About six days ago.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.430
Then you'll be seeing him
within the next 24 hours.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.920
Where?

05:59.440 --> 06:00.556
I don't know.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.070
No, I don't. I don't know...

06:03.280 --> 06:06.910
...until they call me
with the next location.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.269
Please.

06:12.760 --> 06:15.594
Fish him out of the tub,
and, Dembe, while you're at it...

06:15.760 --> 06:17.831
...have him take a look
at that mole.

06:18.520 --> 06:19.715
It's a freckle.

06:27.400 --> 06:28.550
Let me guess:

06:28.720 --> 06:30.871
You and the pastor
are dear friends.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.599
Never met the man.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.319
I am, however, a benefactor...

06:34.480 --> 06:38.520
...for the artist they hired
to lead the restoration.

06:38.680 --> 06:39.909
As luck would have it...

06:40.080 --> 06:42.914
...sprucing up the old apse hole
will take months.

06:43.960 --> 06:46.191
You're squatting in a church.

06:46.360 --> 06:50.240
I usually have a devil of a time
getting to sleep, but here...

06:50.440 --> 06:53.114
...I sleep like a babe in the manger.

06:53.320 --> 06:54.913
- Did you get Kirk's doctor?
- Yes.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.520
He's going to lead me to Kirk.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.036
I want to be there when he does.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.559
The Lindquist Concern.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.399
- Don't change the subject.
- I'm not.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.040
The doctor gets us Kirk.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.876
The Lindquist Concern
gets Kirk to give us Agnes.

07:09.360 --> 07:10.589
Why? Who are they?

07:10.760 --> 07:12.911
A group that corporations pay...

07:13.120 --> 07:17.273
...to suppress inventions that would
undercut them if brought to market.

07:17.440 --> 07:18.874
Companies do that all the time.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.231
Buy up patents just to shelve them.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.040
Big oil did it to the NiMh battery
in the '90s.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.112
When they can't kill the invention...

07:26.280 --> 07:29.478
...they have the Lindquist Concern
kill the inventor.

07:29.680 --> 07:33.913
Like Omar Najjar. He was working
on revolutionary technology...

07:34.080 --> 07:36.754
...with the potential
to save millions of lives.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.389
Now that it's in the hands
of the Lindquist Concern...

07:39.600 --> 07:40.954
...it will save none.

07:41.360 --> 07:45.479
I'll call it in, but if you have a line
on Kirk I'm staying with you.

07:51.160 --> 07:54.471
Agent Navabi.
I have your next case.

07:54.680 --> 07:57.275
Ian Pugachevsky worked on
a cold-fusion device...

07:57.440 --> 07:59.033
...in his basement for 20 years.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.835
Two weeks after claiming
he had a breakthrough...

08:02.080 --> 08:04.037
...he vanished while hiking
in the Sierras.

08:04.200 --> 08:07.477
This is Karen Rose. She developed
an alternative to opiate painkillers...

08:07.680 --> 08:11.356
...that was just as strong, non-addictive,
and had fewer side effects...

08:11.520 --> 08:13.830
...but before reaching clinical trials
she died...

08:14.040 --> 08:15.679
...of an apparent overdose.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.951
According to Reddington,
they were murdered...

08:18.120 --> 08:20.874
...their ideas suppressed
and their research never found.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.430
Well, did he say
how any of this relates to Kirk?

08:23.640 --> 08:27.395
No, but he did say that a number
of accidental deaths...

08:27.560 --> 08:29.756
...of amateur scientists
and inventors...

08:29.920 --> 08:33.038
...are actually homicides
committed by the Lindquist Concern.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.559
Who was the most recent?

08:34.760 --> 08:36.159
- Omar Najjar.
- Married, no children.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.751
Chemical engineer in R & D
at Bethesda Plastics.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.070
Start there.

08:41.240 --> 08:43.835
If someone hired this
Lindquist Concern to kill Najjar...

08:44.039 --> 08:47.351
...I want to know what revolutionary
technology they got their hands on.

08:50.520 --> 08:51.556
Make it quick.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.234
He gets massages twice a week...

08:53.400 --> 08:55.392
...from a woman who moonlights
as an FBI informant.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.514
<i>- Does he?
- He does now.</i>

08:57.760 --> 09:00.229
I need you to get contracts
and a payment history...

09:00.400 --> 09:01.800
...documenting her work.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.798
And by "get" you mean fabricate.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.514
Name's Annabelle Dixon.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.280
I'm asking you to help me
get intel on Alexander Kirk.

09:10.240 --> 09:12.709
I am asking you to help me
get my daughter back.

09:13.840 --> 09:15.513
Let me see what I can do.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.878
We do high-volume
injection-molded plastic components.

09:19.040 --> 09:20.679
Not to speak ill of the dead...

09:20.840 --> 09:22.797
...but Omar
wasn't exactly a rock star.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.519
<i>- What's that mean?
- I don't know.</i>

09:24.680 --> 09:27.991
He was quiet, kept to himself.
Hard to get to know.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.079
<i>- You worked together how long?
- Three years.</i>

09:30.280 --> 09:33.398
You know how many times we saw him
at the Christmas party or picnic?

09:33.560 --> 09:34.835
Zero.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.077
He was smart
and recently super-excited.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.078
<i>He'd had some kind of breakthrough.</i>

09:39.280 --> 09:40.600
<i>- On what?
- I don't know.</i>

09:40.800 --> 09:42.359
<i>Not anything he was doing here.</i>

09:42.560 --> 09:44.313
<i>We have IP clauses in our contracts...</i>

09:44.520 --> 09:46.512
<i>...that allow us
to pursue outside projects.</i>

09:47.880 --> 09:48.916
Theo, these need your signature.

09:49.120 --> 09:51.919
Excuse me.
Omar Najjar, did you know him?

09:52.080 --> 09:55.471
Not really. I wish I could help.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.672
Sorry to interrupt.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.391
I don't know what Omar
was working on, but it was big.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.752
If you're here because you think
it got him killed, talk to his wife.

10:04.920 --> 10:07.674
If anyone knew what he was up to,
it was her.

10:22.520 --> 10:24.273
Somebody down here?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.992
"My husband Omar was my life.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.992
I can't go on without him.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.556
To end this pain I must end my life.
Please understand.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.951
Suicide was my only option.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.435
Mona Najjar."

11:01.600 --> 11:03.432
M.E. says no criminality.

11:03.680 --> 11:07.071
No defensive wounds, no bruises,
and the body wasn't moved postmortem.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.556
If he's wrong
and she really was killed...

11:09.760 --> 11:11.194
I mean, look at all that blood.

11:11.440 --> 11:15.116
It tells me that someone cut her wrist
while she was still alive.

11:15.360 --> 11:16.714
And look at this.

11:16.880 --> 11:19.315
- Fun summer reading?
- Hidden inside...

11:19.960 --> 11:23.590
...Omar and one of the coworkers
that I spoke with.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.794
What about it?

11:26.200 --> 11:28.317
She said she didn't know him.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.719
It won't come.

11:35.560 --> 11:36.710
What?

11:37.080 --> 11:38.958
Forgiveness.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.634
For Kate.

11:40.840 --> 11:42.877
For what I did.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.032
You did nothing.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.713
Exactly.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.352
Your daughter is safe.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.279
You've seen Agnes?

12:00.480 --> 12:02.472
Alexander's
taking excellent care of her.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.430
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

12:05.600 --> 12:09.196
He moves so Reddington can't find her.
He's protecting her from him.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.160
Do you know what he did to me?

12:11.320 --> 12:14.392
Your daughter being with a man
capable of that kind of cruelty?

12:14.960 --> 12:17.350
You could be asking me that
about either of them.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.511
I can't defend everything
Alexander has done.

12:21.760 --> 12:23.797
I can defend why he did it.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.993
Alexander's a good man.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.873
Mind your bedside manners.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.000
Hello?

12:34.200 --> 12:35.680
Yes.

12:38.520 --> 12:39.795
I understand.

12:40.600 --> 12:41.636
Go ahead.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.434
Tell Mr. Kirk I'll be there.

12:44.640 --> 12:45.994
Goodbye.

12:49.200 --> 12:52.796
Dembe, please inform Edward
we're going to Geneva.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.313
Elizabeth, I need all the satellite intel
the task force can get their hands on...

12:57.480 --> 13:00.518
...for this address
as well as schematics for the building.

13:00.680 --> 13:01.716
Listen to me.

13:01.920 --> 13:04.833
This doesn't need to be another one
of your scorched-earth raids.

13:05.040 --> 13:09.080
A curious concern for a mama grizzly
going after her cub.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.511
In my experience, when people lie
about knowing the victim...

13:14.680 --> 13:17.240
...they were involved in the murder.

13:18.800 --> 13:22.111
I wasn't involved in Omar's murder.

13:23.160 --> 13:25.277
I was involved with him.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.073
You lied to keep the affair secret.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.192
Nobody at work knew about us...

13:29.360 --> 13:31.158
...or about what he was working on.

13:31.320 --> 13:34.518
- Which was?
- A desalination process.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.354
Six hundred million people don't have
access to clean water...

13:37.520 --> 13:41.036
...and Omar invented a way
to extract it from seawater...

13:41.200 --> 13:45.558
...that's efficient and cheap and can be
scaled to service entire cities.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.717
Who else did Omar
talk to about this?

13:47.920 --> 13:50.754
No one until last weekend.

13:50.960 --> 13:54.271
<i>He met this amazing guy.</i>

13:54.520 --> 13:57.991
<i>He knew everything about bringing
an idea to market.</i>

13:58.200 --> 14:00.112
<i>For a surefire
self-confidence booster...</i>

14:00.280 --> 14:02.033
<i>...groom yourself, dress nicely...</i>

14:02.240 --> 14:04.357
<i>...stand tall, prepare.</i>

14:04.520 --> 14:08.070
<i>- Where did they meet?
- At the Inventors' Expo in Trenton.</i>

14:08.320 --> 14:10.630
<i>He gave Omar hours
of free advice...</i>

14:10.800 --> 14:14.430
...and Omar walked him through
every step of the invention.

14:14.800 --> 14:19.113
If this guy, whoever he is,
if he killed Omar and his wife...

14:19.560 --> 14:21.597
...I could be next.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.839
I'm the only other person who knew
what he was working on.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.793
<i>You gotta find this attorney.</i>

14:26.960 --> 14:29.031
Magnesium is more abundant,
less reactive...

14:29.200 --> 14:31.157
...and cheaper to produce
than lithium.

14:36.920 --> 14:39.196
- I'm so sorry.
- Sorry about that.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.999
- There you go.
- Thank you.

14:42.400 --> 14:46.155
Hold on.
This doesn't say "patent pending."

14:46.360 --> 14:49.831
You're not pitching your invention
without intellectual-property protection?

14:50.040 --> 14:51.554
Oh, no, I mean...

14:51.720 --> 14:53.518
Yeah, I was.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.160
I know. I'm a huge moron, right?

14:55.360 --> 14:56.396
Not if your idea sucks.

14:56.560 --> 14:59.075
If it's brilliant,
then yeah, you're a moron.

14:59.240 --> 15:00.959
Find good patent counsel.

15:01.120 --> 15:04.591
VC's won't invest unless they know
your technology's protected.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.794
Then protect me.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.592
You're an attorney, right?

15:09.840 --> 15:12.833
I stood behind you in the lunch line.
Eavesdropped.

15:13.520 --> 15:14.590
What's your name?

15:15.000 --> 15:16.719
Riley Emerson.

15:16.920 --> 15:18.673
You have a working prototype, Riley?

15:18.880 --> 15:21.076
Like you said,
"Show no one until it's patented."

15:22.600 --> 15:26.116
Let me know if you want me
to take a look.

15:26.320 --> 15:29.631
Maybe I can file
the patent application pro bono.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.190
Here's my cell.

15:31.360 --> 15:32.919
You'll never get
past my assistant.

15:34.440 --> 15:36.591
She's there to protect me
from people like you.

15:49.640 --> 15:51.040
What is this?

15:51.200 --> 15:53.317
- Who are you?
- That doesn't matter, Vasily.

15:53.520 --> 15:57.036
What matters is that you're passing
state secrets to the FBI...

15:57.200 --> 15:58.839
...through Annabelle Dixon.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.720
- Please.
- She works for them. She's your handler.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.832
I'm prepared to keep that fact secret...

16:04.000 --> 16:07.630
...if and only if you give me the SVR file
on Alexander Kirk.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.679
- I have no time for this.
- Surveillance photos.

16:10.840 --> 16:13.958
Signed confession witnessed
by Special Agent Donald Ressler.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.038
Go ahead and ask her. She'll deny it.

16:16.280 --> 16:19.478
But by then, your reputation's
gonna be destroyed.

16:20.360 --> 16:23.990
All I'm asking for is intel on a man
that your own government detests.

16:24.160 --> 16:28.234
So I'll give you one hour to decide
whether you want to ruin his life...

16:28.400 --> 16:29.914
...or yours.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.110
Elise, hey.

16:40.320 --> 16:43.597
I'm not really allowed
to Facetime at work.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.156
<i>Yeah, I know,
but it's kind of an emergency.</i>

16:46.320 --> 16:48.630
<i>The dishwasher...</i>

16:48.800 --> 16:50.359
<i>I know. Disaster.</i>

16:50.560 --> 16:52.916
<i>I was trying to clean up,
not that you're a slob.</i>

16:53.720 --> 16:55.518
<i>I'm not great with appliances.</i>

16:55.720 --> 17:00.078
<i>So if you don't want your apartment
to turn into a bubble bath, maybe you...</i>

17:00.240 --> 17:02.357
<i>- ...could help me out here...
- Bad time?</i>

17:03.000 --> 17:04.354
No.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.316
Maybe.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.392
The footage
of Omar meeting our suspect.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.199
Were you able to enhance the video?

17:12.359 --> 17:15.558
Yes, but not enough to run the image
through a database.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.672
What I did find...

17:18.400 --> 17:21.154
...was this.

17:21.319 --> 17:22.356
A business card.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.153
"Goodwin, Benham and Yates, L.L.P."

17:24.319 --> 17:27.199
It's a D.C. law firm specializing
in I.P. and patent law.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.471
"Charles T. Gellner"? Okay.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.950
Looks like I will be paying
Mr. Gellner a visit.

17:32.160 --> 17:34.516
My dishwasher, it's...

17:34.680 --> 17:35.909
...super-finicky.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.560
I almost always dry by hand.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.550
I'm gonna go.

17:39.720 --> 17:43.475
Right, I'm just saying
it wasn't her fault, the bubbles.

17:45.480 --> 17:47.199
FYI.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.511
Charles Gellner.
Agents Navabi and Ressler, FBI.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.956
- We need you to come with us.
- Why? What's wrong?

17:55.120 --> 17:57.351
- This doesn't concern you.
- I think it might.

17:57.760 --> 18:01.117
- And why is that?
- Because I'm Charles Gellner.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.599
I'm afraid to tell you
that someone's stolen your identity.

18:04.760 --> 18:06.114
What makes you think that?

18:07.880 --> 18:09.314
Well, sir...

18:09.560 --> 18:10.596
Because you're black.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.799
Not a crime.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.715
- Hello?
- Mr. Wellington, hey.

18:33.920 --> 18:35.798
This is Riley Emerson.
We met in Boston.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.517
Riley. Funny, I was just talking
about you with my managing partner.

18:40.760 --> 18:42.717
About whether I was brilliant
or a moron?

18:42.920 --> 18:44.240
About your idea.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.880
We think it's very interesting.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.271
We'd like to talk
about helping you out.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.151
<i>Oh, my God. That's so great.</i>

18:51.320 --> 18:54.040
<i>Do you want to get together,
let me show you the prototype?</i>

18:54.240 --> 18:56.709
I'd like nothing more.

19:05.400 --> 19:06.720
The law firm checks out.

19:06.920 --> 19:09.640
Lindquist agents assume the identities
of patent experts...

19:09.800 --> 19:13.680
...to lure inventors into revealing
their ideas and their research.

19:13.880 --> 19:15.917
The number on the card.
Where are we on that?

19:16.080 --> 19:17.639
Three of the numbers were hidden...

19:17.840 --> 19:20.400
...so I had to run down
a few hundred combinations...

19:20.560 --> 19:22.916
Two hundred and forty-six,
to be exact.

19:23.080 --> 19:28.712
...And in addition to two PTA presidents
and an amazing doggie day care...

19:28.920 --> 19:31.674
...I found this burner phone.

19:31.840 --> 19:34.116
I had the cell carrier
triangulate its location...

19:34.280 --> 19:36.192
...to this apartment building
in Oak Hill.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.915
- How many people live there?
- One hundred and twelve.

19:39.120 --> 19:43.433
But our suspect's name
is Silas Gouldsberry.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.751
- How do you know?
- He is the only tenant...

19:45.960 --> 19:47.679
...who works for the patent office.

19:48.240 --> 19:49.310
Get there now.

19:52.360 --> 19:55.034
- Navabi.
- Samar, hi.

19:55.200 --> 19:58.352
I hope this isn't weird,
me calling you.

19:58.520 --> 20:01.240
My name is Elise.
I'm a friend of Aram's and...

20:01.920 --> 20:03.593
Elise. Hello.

20:03.800 --> 20:06.235
I hope you didn't
flood the apartment again.

20:06.440 --> 20:07.669
<i>He told you about that.</i>

20:08.480 --> 20:10.358
Why wouldn't he?
He tells you everything.

20:10.560 --> 20:13.029
<i>- I'm a little jealous.
- Can I help you with something?</i>

20:13.760 --> 20:16.992
From what I can tell,
you know him so well...

20:17.440 --> 20:19.557
<i>...and the point is, why I called...</i>

20:20.080 --> 20:23.039
Aram, his perfect date.

20:23.240 --> 20:24.276
<i>What would that be?</i>

20:24.440 --> 20:26.477
That's why you're calling?
For dating advice?

20:26.680 --> 20:28.433
<i>Yeah, I mean,
you're his best friend.</i>

20:28.640 --> 20:31.678
And after nearly destroying
his place today...

20:31.920 --> 20:34.230
...I want to give him a night
he'll never forget.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.472
<i>How would you do that?</i>

20:46.040 --> 20:48.509
He admires Kirk.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.119
Says he's a good man.

20:51.640 --> 20:53.393
He shouldn't.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.433
And he's not.

20:57.080 --> 20:59.037
I'm in the middle.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.870
Between you and Kirk,
between Tom and Kirk.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.874
Can you at least admit
how difficult that is?

21:05.080 --> 21:06.673
No.

21:08.160 --> 21:12.279
It's only difficult if you accept
the premise that Kirk is your father.

21:12.520 --> 21:14.318
I don't.

21:19.680 --> 21:21.273
At the church...

21:21.480 --> 21:23.995
...what was Dembe praying for?

21:24.200 --> 21:26.078
Salvation...

21:26.840 --> 21:29.071
...that will never come.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.635
- FBI!
- Federal agents!

21:36.160 --> 21:37.799
Kitchen clear.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.438
- Bathroom clear.
- Clear.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.434
- Bedroom clear.
- What's down that hall?

21:47.800 --> 21:51.430
It's a bit of a directory of registered
patent attorneys and patent agents.

21:51.600 --> 21:54.035
He's got half a dozen doctored IDs...

21:54.200 --> 21:56.715
...with matching business cards:

21:56.960 --> 22:00.715
"patent agent, angel investor,
patent attorney."

22:01.240 --> 22:03.118
"Charles Gellner."

22:03.840 --> 22:06.116
- What's that?
- His next victim.

22:09.080 --> 22:12.596
A magnesium battery
is the holy grail of energy storage.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.275
Everyone and their mother
is working on one...

22:15.440 --> 22:18.558
...but no one could find
a magnesium-friendly electrolyte.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.871
- That's the stuff...
- The material that allows...

22:21.080 --> 22:23.595
...the ions to flow
between electrodes.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.917
Hey, you know your stuff.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.591
And you, all of 24, have cracked it.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.595
That is pretty young...

22:42.760 --> 22:44.479
...to be a billionaire.

22:49.120 --> 22:50.793
<i>This is Riley. Leave a message.</i>

22:50.960 --> 22:53.680
Riley, this is Special Agent
Samar Navabi with the FBI.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.752
We believe you may be in danger.

22:55.920 --> 23:00.278
I am going to file for expedited status
on the patent application.

23:01.320 --> 23:06.759
Anyone who knows anything about this
is gonna have to sign a non-disclosure.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.320
And that includes me.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.238
Haven't really
had anyone else to tell.

23:21.760 --> 23:25.117
You know, you're the first person
to ever really believe in me.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.360
Thank...

23:29.000 --> 23:30.753
You okay there?

23:31.200 --> 23:33.669
Yeah. No, I mean...

23:34.160 --> 23:36.277
I don't think you are.

24:08.520 --> 24:10.477
So stupid.

24:10.880 --> 24:14.237
You should never use a car engine
to power anything in a garage...

24:14.440 --> 24:16.033
...with no ventilation.

24:28.360 --> 24:29.555
There's a car running.

24:30.720 --> 24:31.915
Got it.

24:45.400 --> 24:46.436
Ressler!

24:49.160 --> 24:50.310
It's okay.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.278
Ressler! Got her!

24:57.520 --> 24:58.636
The car...

25:05.000 --> 25:08.391
I need an ambulance.
310 Northview Drive.

25:12.920 --> 25:16.596
<i>During World War II,
the Oeuvres de Secours aux Enfants...</i>

25:16.760 --> 25:19.992
...smuggled Jewish children
out of France to Switzerland.

25:20.200 --> 25:22.840
This was one of their staging areas.

25:23.040 --> 25:25.396
Now it's mine.

25:28.280 --> 25:31.478
Are you planning an extraction
or a land war in Asia?

25:31.640 --> 25:34.474
My plan is to make
contact with you...

25:34.640 --> 25:38.429
...as soon as Alexander Kirk
is in my possession.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.918
What do you mean?

25:41.120 --> 25:42.156
I'm going with you.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.516
Given your conflicted
feelings for Kirk...

25:44.680 --> 25:46.911
...I believe that would be unwise.

25:47.120 --> 25:49.589
I gave you the satellite intel
on Kirk's location.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.479
I'm the reason
you're able to get him.

25:51.680 --> 25:54.434
Which I appreciate,
but as you said, you're in the middle.

25:55.240 --> 25:58.790
Given our mission, that's not
a point of view we can indulge.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.719
I'm not going anywhere.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.633
My point exactly.

26:11.120 --> 26:12.156
UNITED STATES PATENT & TRADEMARK
OFFICE - DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE

26:12.320 --> 26:13.356
I have a subpoena here
for Silas Gouldsberry's...

26:13.520 --> 26:16.080
...phone, computer
and employment records.

26:16.240 --> 26:20.029
And I need you to revoke
his employee-access card.

26:23.640 --> 26:27.031
I can revoke the card,
but it won't do you much good.

26:27.240 --> 26:28.310
Why is that?

26:28.560 --> 26:30.074
He's in the building.

26:31.040 --> 26:32.235
Navabi, what do you know?

26:32.480 --> 26:34.836
He's here. Gouldsberry swiped in
two minutes ago.

26:35.040 --> 26:37.475
- Do you have a visual?
- No, but security's alerted.

26:37.640 --> 26:38.994
The building is in lockdown.

26:39.240 --> 26:42.153
We'll set a perimeter.
Agent Ressler, get there now.

26:45.240 --> 26:47.277
I have a visual.
Basement, sector five. Sir...

26:55.800 --> 26:57.598
Buttercup,
glad you could make it.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.752
Now HR can...

27:01.720 --> 27:04.030
Everyone, on the ground!

27:26.560 --> 27:27.880
What's on the other side?

27:28.120 --> 27:29.156
Server room.

27:29.360 --> 27:31.192
Call for backup.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.280
Silas Gouldsberry?

27:46.480 --> 27:47.675
FBI.

27:49.640 --> 27:52.633
You've gotten yourself cornered
and you're looking for a way out.

27:53.120 --> 27:54.156
Let me help you.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.552
- I don't need your help.
- Sure you do.

27:56.720 --> 27:57.756
What do you want?

27:57.960 --> 27:59.758
I want money.

27:59.960 --> 28:01.633
Twenty million, in unmarked bills.

28:02.200 --> 28:04.431
Nonconsecutive serial numbers.

28:04.640 --> 28:09.431
In 30 minutes,
or I start shooting the hostages.

28:13.040 --> 28:16.750
Kirk's medical suite is being set up
off the Rue Baulacre.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.475
He'll have a man stationed
on the perimeter here.

28:20.640 --> 28:21.710
Here.

28:21.880 --> 28:24.520
And at least two covering
the south entrance here.

28:25.200 --> 28:28.079
I want everyone to memorize
the way out of the interior.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.550
- I don't want any missteps.
- Excuse me.

28:31.080 --> 28:34.869
There are three medical personnel
there, all good men and women.

28:35.040 --> 28:37.430
- You can't hurt them.
- I'm sorry, Dr. Reifler...

28:37.600 --> 28:39.910
...but you're not part
of the planning committee.

28:53.480 --> 28:57.110
As requested, doctor,
your medical team's safe and sound.

28:57.280 --> 28:58.396
Bravo.

29:02.800 --> 29:05.315
<i>- Dr. Reifler?
- Yes, Alexander, I'm here.</i>

29:05.520 --> 29:07.796
We just passed Rue du Clos.
We'll be right there.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.314
<i>Very good.</i>

29:10.360 --> 29:13.034
- He's five minutes out.
- In five.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.756
I need assurances...

29:20.920 --> 29:23.037
...that your evidence
will be destroyed...

29:23.280 --> 29:27.035
...and your word as an agent
is definitely not satisfactory.

29:27.240 --> 29:29.197
That's good,
because I'm not an agent.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.756
Or a spook.
And the SVR did not task me...

29:31.960 --> 29:35.112
...to find out whether you're
compromised, which you're not.

29:35.280 --> 29:37.431
What, then? Who are you?

29:37.800 --> 29:39.393
I'm a dad.

29:40.360 --> 29:42.875
Alexander Kirk took my little girl.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.796
And I'll do anything to get her back.

29:47.040 --> 29:49.350
So if you pick up your hand...

29:49.520 --> 29:51.716
...and that is your intel on Kirk...

29:52.360 --> 29:54.352
...on my daughter's life
you have my word...

29:54.560 --> 29:57.439
...that my intel on you
will be destroyed.

30:09.920 --> 30:11.639
You won't believe what I'm doing.

30:11.840 --> 30:13.513
<i>- The lead Ressler gave me...
- Nothing.</i>

30:13.680 --> 30:15.034
<i>We found Kirk. He's in Geneva.</i>

30:15.240 --> 30:17.960
Our first lead,
and Reddington leaves me behind...

30:18.160 --> 30:21.073
- ...with a couple of armed guards.
- What do you mean, Geneva?

30:21.240 --> 30:23.960
That's where Kirk's meeting his doctor.
He's headed there.

30:24.360 --> 30:26.352
No, he's not. He's in Russia.

30:26.560 --> 30:28.711
<i>- What do you mean?
- The lead Ressler gave me.</i>

30:28.920 --> 30:31.071
It panned out.
I got the SVR file on Kirk.

30:31.240 --> 30:33.550
- It had actionable intel...
- That Kirk's in Russia?

30:33.720 --> 30:36.519
This morning, they raided
a safe house, but he was gone.

30:36.720 --> 30:38.279
I need to call you back.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.320
<i>- Put him on.
- Elizabeth.</i>

30:55.520 --> 30:56.670
<i>Tell him it's a trap.</i>

30:56.880 --> 30:58.951
You're walking into a trap.

31:00.480 --> 31:02.199
She says this is a setup.

31:26.840 --> 31:28.672
Laurel. Now is not a good time.

31:28.840 --> 31:30.320
I know. That's why I'm here.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.278
The patent office. I want an update.

31:32.440 --> 31:34.238
Twenty hostages,
one wounded, one dead.

31:34.400 --> 31:37.154
Barricaded into a server room.
The demand is 20 million.

31:37.320 --> 31:39.073
We have 22 minutes before
he starts shooting.

31:39.240 --> 31:42.119
And the inventions,
the ones he kills for, where are they?

31:43.520 --> 31:46.479
- How do you know about that?
- I'm the national security adviser.

31:46.640 --> 31:49.519
My job is to know about anything
impacting national security...

31:49.720 --> 31:52.394
...and it's my understanding they do.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.871
How did he know?
How did Kirk know?

32:00.040 --> 32:02.316
I don't know. It wasn't me, okay?

32:02.520 --> 32:04.193
I was with you the whole time.

32:05.560 --> 32:07.711
Tend to my men.

32:10.680 --> 32:12.194
Raymond.

32:18.040 --> 32:19.076
Yeah?

32:19.240 --> 32:20.356
What happened?

32:20.520 --> 32:21.590
Is everyone okay?

32:21.800 --> 32:25.760
No. Men are dead,
others gravely injured...

32:25.960 --> 32:27.872
...because someone warned Kirk.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.273
You don't think...

32:30.600 --> 32:32.239
I called to warn you.

32:34.320 --> 32:35.754
I know that.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.557
You don't sound convinced.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.554
We're at cross purposes, Elizabeth.

32:42.720 --> 32:45.189
Not about Agnes.
About Agnes, we're in lockstep.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.437
But about Kirk, about who he is...

32:47.640 --> 32:51.873
...what he wants, we're at odds.

32:52.240 --> 32:55.392
That's because you can't accept
that Kirk has answers to questions...

32:55.560 --> 32:58.200
...I've been asking my entire life.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.869
Your call saved my life.

33:04.640 --> 33:06.279
Thank you.

33:14.120 --> 33:15.918
Silas.

33:16.280 --> 33:18.192
What condition
is your wounded hostage in?

33:18.720 --> 33:20.313
Better than he deserves.

33:20.480 --> 33:22.995
I see a lot of blood loss here.
Why don't you send him out?

33:23.200 --> 33:24.236
Where's my money?

33:24.400 --> 33:27.393
I'm working on it,
but that amount of money takes time.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.560
"Better than he deserves."
What did you mean by that?

33:31.640 --> 33:32.869
You ever invented anything?

33:33.600 --> 33:36.957
You ever experience
that moment of discovery?

33:37.160 --> 33:38.230
It's a revelation.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.075
And the man you shot?

33:40.280 --> 33:42.795
Will never know what that feels like.

33:43.560 --> 33:44.789
But I do.

33:45.280 --> 33:48.591
I've come up with an idea
that doesn't need a patent.

33:48.760 --> 33:52.595
An idea that is going
to change the world.

33:52.840 --> 33:55.230
I don't see anything
world-altering about this.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.080
You will...

33:57.560 --> 33:59.631
...in 19 minutes.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.357
- What are we looking at?
- I've got access...

34:03.600 --> 34:05.398
...to the patent office's servers...

34:05.640 --> 34:08.792
...and there is an alert
from the TCP retries counter...

34:08.960 --> 34:12.476
...meaning someone is uploading data.
Like, a ton of it.

34:12.639 --> 34:14.313
Why do you think it's Gouldsberry?

34:14.480 --> 34:18.393
- Can you see what's being uploaded?
- No, but I can see how long it'll take.

34:19.360 --> 34:22.989
Fourteen minutes. Same time
he gave Navabi to get the money.

34:23.199 --> 34:26.670
Money he could have made ten times
over selling the inventions he has.

34:26.840 --> 34:30.038
- So it's a smokescreen. For what?
- Aram.

34:30.239 --> 34:33.312
If he had enough schematics,
could uploading them take this long?

34:33.480 --> 34:37.315
Sure, maybe, but if he did that,
then they'd become available...

34:38.800 --> 34:41.679
...to the many
at the expense of the few.

34:42.159 --> 34:44.117
- He's open-sourcing them.
- Is HRT in place?

34:44.280 --> 34:45.634
- Yes.
- Send it in now.

34:45.840 --> 34:48.071
- If I do that, hostages will die.
- If you don't...

34:48.280 --> 34:49.793
...national security
will be compromised.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.076
- We don't know that.
- Harold...

34:51.239 --> 34:53.072
...the ideas he has
are revolutionary, right?

34:53.239 --> 34:54.754
In medicine and in energy...

34:54.920 --> 34:58.197
...and for all you know,
in computers and next-gen weaponry.

34:58.360 --> 35:02.036
You really want to open source that to
Russia, China, Iran and North Korea?

35:02.240 --> 35:05.074
What I want is to let this play out
for another 13 minutes.

35:05.240 --> 35:06.674
Resolve it without a bloodbath.

35:06.840 --> 35:08.593
That's not a risk I'm willing to take.

35:08.760 --> 35:11.320
Send in the breach order or I will.

35:11.480 --> 35:15.190
I was 23 when
I sold my first invention.

35:16.320 --> 35:18.198
I was gonna be a star.

35:18.840 --> 35:21.674
The company that bought it,
they had a plan.

35:21.840 --> 35:25.151
We were gonna save lives
and change the world.

35:25.640 --> 35:27.950
Three weeks after signing it over...

35:28.160 --> 35:29.753
...they killed it.

35:29.920 --> 35:33.709
Shelved my idea for the sake
of their bottom line.

35:34.760 --> 35:37.594
After that, I'd tell anyone who cared
to listen what happened.

35:37.760 --> 35:38.796
I warned them.

35:38.960 --> 35:41.520
But they didn't see the censorship.

35:41.960 --> 35:44.919
All they saw was the payday.
The money.

35:45.360 --> 35:46.396
Team's in position?

35:46.560 --> 35:48.517
Perimeters are set.
We enter on your ready.

35:48.680 --> 35:52.037
People start out with a pure idea.

35:52.200 --> 35:53.680
It gets corrupted.

35:53.920 --> 35:55.400
That's why I came to work here.

35:55.560 --> 35:58.200
So I could be exposed
to breakthrough technologies...

35:58.360 --> 36:01.592
...and prevent them falling victim
to corporate greed.

36:02.080 --> 36:04.311
You think I'm trying
to suppress inventions?

36:04.520 --> 36:07.274
I'm doing the exact opposite.

36:07.440 --> 36:09.033
That's my great idea.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.114
I'm gonna set them free.

36:12.320 --> 36:14.198
I can't let you do that, Silas.

36:15.560 --> 36:18.120
In eight minutes, it'll be done.

36:18.320 --> 36:20.630
You enter before that...

36:21.520 --> 36:23.000
...the hostages die.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.275
Call in the order, Harold...

36:35.440 --> 36:37.716
...or that countdown's
what's left of your career.

36:37.920 --> 36:39.912
I'm not sending my men in
guns blazing.

36:40.080 --> 36:41.833
Sir, I think I have another way.

36:42.040 --> 36:43.759
<i>- The fire-suppression system.
- Yes.</i>

36:43.920 --> 36:45.673
<i>If you set it off, safety override...</i>

36:45.880 --> 36:47.075
...should open the doors.

36:47.280 --> 36:49.875
You should be able to access it
from a utility module...

36:50.040 --> 36:51.076
...in the fire panel.

36:52.080 --> 36:53.719
All right, Aram, talk to me.

36:53.880 --> 36:56.918
<i>There should be a circuit board
on the lower right corner.</i>

36:57.120 --> 36:59.316
- What the hell's going on?
- We're working on it.

36:59.520 --> 37:00.795
We have less than a minute.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.639
I found the circuit board.
What now?

37:02.800 --> 37:04.871
<i>We're gonna kill the power
to the fire system.</i>

37:05.080 --> 37:07.549
Doing so will release
a fire-suppression agent.

37:07.760 --> 37:10.958
It's an inert gas, so it's safe,
but you might have a problem with...

37:11.160 --> 37:12.150
Aram!

37:12.320 --> 37:14.755
The plug with two red wires
just below the green blinking light.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.872
- Pull it now.
- A problem with what, Aram?

37:17.120 --> 37:18.474
Visibility.

37:27.920 --> 37:29.240
Drop it!

37:33.880 --> 37:37.032
<i>Don't pull out the flash drive.
To corrupt the entire zip file...</i>

37:37.240 --> 37:39.436
...hit "abort"
on the data transfer dialogue.

37:42.040 --> 37:43.394
Yes.

38:00.080 --> 38:01.639
We didn't get Agnes.

38:01.920 --> 38:03.320
I know.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.434
I talked to Ressler.

38:07.200 --> 38:11.911
This SVR report, when I talked to you
earlier, I hadn't finished reading it.

38:12.080 --> 38:13.719
Did you find something
about Agnes?

38:13.920 --> 38:14.990
No.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.157
Then what difference does it make?

38:22.640 --> 38:23.960
It's about you.

38:27.440 --> 38:28.476
And your father.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.872
What's this?

38:34.080 --> 38:36.117
It's a DNA report.

38:42.960 --> 38:43.996
Here they are.

38:44.160 --> 38:46.311
Hey, you did great work today.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.310
What's she doing here?

38:50.560 --> 38:52.153
You have the data file?

38:52.880 --> 38:55.873
I wish I could meet all the people
who dreamed up what's on here.

38:56.040 --> 38:57.315
Every one of them killed...

38:58.120 --> 39:01.477
...for no other reason than the power
of their imagination.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.630
You know who she is,
and you're gonna give her that?

39:12.840 --> 39:14.479
Yes, Agent Ressler, he does...

39:14.640 --> 39:16.279
...but apparently, you've forgotten.

39:16.440 --> 39:20.320
She is your boss' boss' boss' boss.

39:20.480 --> 39:23.996
Well, my boss' boss' boss' boss...

39:24.200 --> 39:25.270
...is a killer.

39:25.560 --> 39:27.791
See, I know you murdered
Reven Wright...

39:28.000 --> 39:29.992
- ...and one day, I'll prove it.
- Harold...

39:30.200 --> 39:32.396
...I'll give the president
your regards.

39:33.760 --> 39:35.399
Excuse me.

39:37.960 --> 39:39.633
Thank you.

39:45.680 --> 39:47.990
That's the only invention
you're interested in?

39:49.480 --> 39:50.516
Yes.

39:50.720 --> 39:54.396
Because I've seen the rest,
and they're incredible.

39:56.760 --> 39:58.991
Good afternoon, Laurel.

40:00.840 --> 40:02.718
- All right.
- Per our agreement...

40:02.960 --> 40:04.235
...no friends-and-family discount.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.710
Our compatriots on the Cabal
pay full market value.

40:06.920 --> 40:09.480
My cut is 50 percent.
That sounds greedy.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.916
Forty-five percent.

40:20.320 --> 40:21.834
Our asset made contact.

40:22.280 --> 40:24.112
Reddington survived.

40:28.880 --> 40:31.839
- Have you seen Aram? I need his report.
- He left earlier.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.992
Right, date night.

40:34.760 --> 40:36.991
So she order takeout
from Pacos Tacos?

40:37.200 --> 40:39.078
Oh, yeah. And a ginger beer...

40:39.240 --> 40:41.232
...and crispy beef from Ho Kow...

40:41.400 --> 40:44.120
...and chicken from that disgusting
Italian place he likes.

40:44.280 --> 40:46.590
- That place got a B.
- She's really working it.

40:46.760 --> 40:48.433
<i>If he likes her, I'm happy for him...</i>

40:48.600 --> 40:50.831
<i>...but there's something
about her that bugs me.</i>

40:51.040 --> 40:53.953
<i>It's terrible. She's nice to him.
I mean, personally...</i>

40:54.680 --> 40:57.115
<i>...I hate it when cute girls
buy me crispy beef.</i>

40:57.280 --> 41:00.717
She may be cute, but trust me.
She'll age badly.

41:00.880 --> 41:03.918
I've been to that Italian place.
They dump garlic on everything.

41:04.760 --> 41:08.151
<i>That was kind of a genius move,
you telling her to go there.</i>

41:09.360 --> 41:10.589
It wasn't a move.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.956
He won't want to kiss her
with garlic breath.

41:13.120 --> 41:15.635
<i>Okay, that's just gross, Ressler.</i>

41:15.800 --> 41:17.598
<i>You got nothing to worry about.</i>

41:19.280 --> 41:21.511
I'm not worried.

41:35.600 --> 41:37.353
You lied to me about everything.

41:37.520 --> 41:40.957
May I pour you a glass
of this delicious Aglianico?

41:45.080 --> 41:46.150
What's this?

41:46.320 --> 41:48.277
A DNA report.

41:48.520 --> 41:51.911
Proof that Alexander Kirk
is my father.

41:53.800 --> 41:56.440
You told me my father was dead.

41:56.840 --> 41:58.797
That I killed him.

42:00.960 --> 42:04.192
Everything you've said
from the start...

42:05.000 --> 42:07.276
...from the very beginning...

42:08.200 --> 42:10.192
...all lies.
