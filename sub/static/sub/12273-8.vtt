to the left and right *

01:03.797 --> 01:06.234
* The left and right

01:06.267 --> 01:09.403
* Throw your hands
straight up in the sky *

01:09.437 --> 01:10.838

01:10.871 --> 01:13.574
* Next your head,
you put it at your feet *

01:13.607 --> 01:16.777
* And stick your arm
to the side *

01:16.810 --> 01:19.680
* And shake your hand
like it's gone to sleep *

01:19.713 --> 01:21.882

* Next your head,
put it at your feet *

01:35.363 --> 01:38.532
* And stick your arm
to the side *

01:38.566 --> 01:40.734
* Shake your hand
like it's gone to sleep *

FLACK:
Cleaning crew found him
about an hour ago.

02:36.790 --> 02:39.460
Principal's on
his way in now.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.861
What was he doing
here on a Saturday?

02:40.894 --> 02:41.862
The SATs were
this morning.

02:41.895 --> 02:45.266
Best guess, he was
studying late last night,

02:45.299 --> 02:46.767
someone locked up
without knowing he was here.

02:46.800 --> 02:50.304
Kid doesn't come home
and his parents don't report it?

02:50.338 --> 02:53.173
Who knows what
his home life was like?

02:58.312 --> 02:59.680
Blunt and sharp force trauma.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.621
Here's your murder weapon
right here.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.591
Whatever happened,
it's safe to say

03:10.624 --> 03:12.560
our perp didn't have
much of a plan.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.697
And our vic's was snuffed out.

03:39.287 --> 03:43.624
* Out here in the fields

03:43.657 --> 03:47.561
* I fight for my meals

03:47.595 --> 03:51.965
* I get my back into my living

03:54.602 --> 03:58.739
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.015
(camera shutter clicks)

04:15.456 --> 04:19.026
*

04:37.778 --> 04:39.780
*

04:58.098 --> 04:59.800
No to the Post,
no to the Daily News.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.835
I'll have a comment when there's
something to comment on.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.072
Those in the vic's backpack?

05:05.105 --> 05:06.774
Yeah. Dextroamphetamines.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.709
Vic might have
suffered from ADHD.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.077
Did have an I.D., though.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.745
Wallet was in the vic's
backpack.

05:11.779 --> 05:14.782
Uh, Luke Stevenson,
DOB: 8/12/94.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.684
Luke Stevenson?

05:16.717 --> 05:17.685
What's the address?

05:17.718 --> 05:20.654
1013 Kings Row, Brooklyn.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.613
*

06:15.843 --> 06:19.413
MAN:
Got called to a scene
around 8:00 last night.

06:21.815 --> 06:25.819
When I got home,
his door was closed.

06:25.853 --> 06:28.889
I assumed he was asleep.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.459
I knew he had
the S.A.T. this morning.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.494
I'm so sorry, Frank.

06:33.527 --> 06:34.928
I can call your ex-wife.

06:34.962 --> 06:37.898
No, I'll tell her.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.867
She should hear it from me.

06:41.869 --> 06:44.104
(voice breaking):
I don't understand.

06:44.137 --> 06:47.140
He was such
a good kid, you know?

06:47.174 --> 06:48.609
You met him.

06:49.977 --> 06:50.978
He never did anything wrong.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.881
Not a damn thing.

06:53.914 --> 06:54.682
We don't know much
right now, Frank.

06:54.715 --> 06:55.983
Is there anything
you can tell me?

06:56.016 --> 06:58.819
I don't know.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.454
(exhales)

07:04.525 --> 07:08.462
A week ago, his friend Nate,
Nate Paulson,

07:08.496 --> 07:12.833
he OD'd mixing prescription
meds with alcohol.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.935
It was rough on Luke.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.136
But he seemed okay.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.105
We talked about it.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.474
What kind of meds?

07:22.676 --> 07:24.077
I don't know.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.914
Did Luke have ADHD?

07:26.947 --> 07:28.148
Attention deficit?

07:28.181 --> 07:29.983
No.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.852
Why are you asking me?

07:31.885 --> 07:34.254
We found a bag of pills
in his backpack.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.824
Dextroamphetamines.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.659
They're used to treat...

07:38.692 --> 07:39.960
I know what they're used for.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.061
Luke didn't have ADHD.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.997
Is it possible he could have
taken his friend's death

07:44.031 --> 07:45.232
harder than you think?

07:45.265 --> 07:47.267
Maybe he was having
trouble dealing with...

07:47.300 --> 07:49.002
They weren't his.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.838
Frank.
They weren't his.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.139
What... what are you
telling me?

07:52.172 --> 07:53.674
That he was using them
to get high?

07:53.707 --> 07:54.775
That's not what I'm saying.

07:54.808 --> 07:55.909
He was what?

07:55.943 --> 07:58.178
That he was, uh,
some drug addict,

07:58.211 --> 08:00.047
and I didn't even know about it?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.181
Frank, just listen to me.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.550
That's not what I'm saying.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.852
I don't know that.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.787
Kids use this stuff for
all kinds of reasons.

08:06.820 --> 08:07.888
To study longer.

08:07.921 --> 08:11.058
Focus better on their exams.

08:11.091 --> 08:14.094
With the S.A.T.'s coming up
and college applications,

08:14.127 --> 08:16.229
he could have just
been stressed, and...

08:16.263 --> 08:18.866
No. No way.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.535
Not my boy.

08:42.623 --> 08:43.924
(cell phone vibrates)

09:08.849 --> 09:10.784
(cell phone vibrates)

09:15.255 --> 09:16.657
DANNY:
Hey, it's me.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.158
I figured you might
still be sleeping.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.961
Red-eye probably
knocked you out, huh?

09:20.994 --> 09:23.130
I just wanted
to hear your voice

09:23.163 --> 09:24.865
and see if you're
doing all right.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.734
You don't want
to get into it, I know.

09:26.767 --> 09:30.037
I just thought...
I don't know what I thought.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.939
I just want to know
that you're okay.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.974
So call me back if you feel
like talking, please.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.976
Say hey to your dad for me.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.011
All right? I love you.

09:52.693 --> 09:53.994
Hey. You ready?

09:54.027 --> 09:56.329
I haven't even
eaten yet.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.832
Eat in the truck.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.202
Come on, sleepyhead.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.737
Let's go.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.879
Okay, okay, okay.

10:20.721 --> 10:23.190
I testified for Frank
on numerous homicides.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.424
He would always
talk about him.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.194
Always so proud
of how he was doing.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.228
He tried my first case

10:28.261 --> 10:29.396
on the job.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.264
Luke was only a year old.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.335
Okay.

10:35.368 --> 10:38.706
Uh, nothing particularly
unique to report, I'm afraid.

10:38.739 --> 10:39.673
C.O.D. is as expected.

10:39.707 --> 10:42.843
Blunt and sharp force
trauma to the head.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.077
Multiple blows,

10:44.111 --> 10:47.080
which suggests some
kind of rage, perhaps.

10:47.114 --> 10:51.251
I extracted a shard of the mug

10:51.284 --> 10:54.287
that lodged in the wound tract,
among other, smaller pieces.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.991
Toxicology was
completely clean.

10:58.025 --> 11:00.427
Uh, the same could
not be said...
Hang on.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.428
Tox showed nothing?

11:01.461 --> 11:06.066
No foreign
substances detected.

11:06.099 --> 11:09.336
But I pulled the autopsy
report for Nate Paulson,

11:09.369 --> 11:11.705
like you asked.

11:11.739 --> 11:15.042
He had in excess
of 400 milligrams

11:15.075 --> 11:16.710
of dextroamphetamine
in his system.

11:16.744 --> 11:20.113
Plus a blood alcohol level
of .24.

11:20.147 --> 11:23.016
How long does dextroamphetamine
stay in the system?

11:23.050 --> 11:27.054
Uh, the half-life
is about, uh, ten hours,

11:27.087 --> 11:30.290
so depending on the amount taken
and diet and metabolism,

11:30.323 --> 11:32.125
it would still be
present anywhere

11:32.159 --> 11:34.728
from three to four days
after ingestion.

11:34.762 --> 11:36.096
Something's not right.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.732
Luke had dextro in his backpack.

11:38.766 --> 11:41.969
He was probably up all week,
studying for the S.A.T.'s.

11:42.002 --> 11:44.104
He was cramming for it
when he was killed.

11:44.137 --> 11:47.240
That's exactly when he would
have the stuff in his system,

11:47.274 --> 11:51.344
so... if he was using the
pills as a study drug,

11:51.378 --> 11:53.213
why aren't they
in his system?

11:53.246 --> 11:58.118
I hate to say it, but if he
was in possession of it

11:58.151 --> 11:59.252
but not using it...

11:59.286 --> 12:01.288
He was selling it.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.793
But where was he
getting it from?

12:07.494 --> 12:11.131
Hawkes, you have the plastic
bag of dextro recovered

12:11.164 --> 12:12.165
from Luke's backpack?

12:12.199 --> 12:13.100
Yeah, it's right here, Mac.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.835
Drop what you're doing.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.270
I need you to
print the bag.
You got it.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.841
*

12:51.304 --> 12:53.073
TAYLOR:
Billy Wharton?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.942
He goes to our vic's school.

12:54.975 --> 12:58.145
Frank was right.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.313
The drugs weren't Luke's.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.190
Oof.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.491
Damn, kid.

13:11.524 --> 13:14.828
Do a wash, my man.

13:14.862 --> 13:17.097
Cab drivers smell
better than this.

13:19.599 --> 13:20.834
Satisfied?

13:20.868 --> 13:22.169
You've gone through
both my lockers.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.972
Can... can you just tell me
what you're looking for?

13:25.005 --> 13:26.273
I think you know
what we're looking for.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.208
Actually, I don't,
so can you please just tell me?

13:28.241 --> 13:29.176
Because I'm
a little scared here.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.244
Obviously, this has
something to do with Luke.

13:31.278 --> 13:35.115
Harvard would be lucky to
have someone as smart as you.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.049
What can you tell us
about these?

13:36.083 --> 13:37.450
Wh-Where did...
where did you find those?

13:37.484 --> 13:38.585
Luke's backpack.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.156
I thought it might
have been him.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.292
He-he stole those.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.927
From my locker.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.261
You dealing, too?

13:48.295 --> 13:49.362
He steal your stash?

13:49.396 --> 13:50.430
You guys get into an argument?

13:50.463 --> 13:51.631
Things get out of hand?

13:51.664 --> 13:54.367
I take dextro
and you jump to me dealing?

13:54.401 --> 13:56.203
I'm not a drug dealer, sir.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.871
I-I have
a prescription for those.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.606
Why were they in a plastic bag?

13:59.639 --> 14:01.641
I'm not exactly looking
to advertise that I have ADHD.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.211
I-I don't... I don't need to be
carrying a prescription bottle

14:04.244 --> 14:05.278
around school.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.580
We know there's bad blood
between you and Luke.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.349
As recently
as yesterday morning.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.219
Luke, I saw you.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.353
You were copying
off my exam.

14:13.386 --> 14:16.023
Now, you know, if you get
caught, it's my ass, too.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.224
Hey, listen to me.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.359
I mean, if our answers
are too similar...

14:19.392 --> 14:20.360
Get the hell out
of my face, man.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.862
What's wrong with you?

14:27.300 --> 14:29.202
Hey, hey, break it up.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.270
That's enough!

14:30.303 --> 14:31.404
That's enough, I said!

14:33.073 --> 14:35.275
One of you better tell me
what this is about.

14:35.308 --> 14:39.112
And when Mr. Connors
broke it up...

14:39.146 --> 14:42.049
I mean, I could have ratted on
him right there, but I didn't.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.616
I kept my mouth shut.

14:43.650 --> 14:46.419
I considered Luke a friend.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.588
Can I go?

14:48.621 --> 14:52.125
I mean, I'm already
late for practice.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.296
Kid's pretty smooth.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.364
He's got an answer
for everything.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.332
Too smooth.

14:59.366 --> 15:02.335
See if his parents
can confirm the prescriptions

15:02.369 --> 15:04.271
and subpoena his
phone records.

15:04.304 --> 15:05.973
Get them to Adam.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.707
If he's clean, I want
to be able to tell Frank

15:07.740 --> 15:09.042
that we looked at everything.

15:18.718 --> 15:21.321
Rooster tail, huh?

15:21.354 --> 15:23.156
Worked when I was a kid.

15:23.190 --> 15:25.292
I'm guessing the trout
haven't wised up any.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.494
Any chance I can convince you
to keep what you catch?

15:27.527 --> 15:29.429
You know, pan-seared
with a little garlic...

15:29.462 --> 15:30.463
No.

15:30.497 --> 15:32.966
(chuckles)

15:38.638 --> 15:41.241
What are you doing here, Linds?

15:41.274 --> 15:42.309
What do you mean?

15:42.342 --> 15:43.710
You brought me out here.

15:43.743 --> 15:44.744
No, home.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.646
What are you
doing home?

15:50.550 --> 15:52.385
What, you think I
shouldn't have come?

15:52.419 --> 15:54.054
Come on.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.455
I love seeing you.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.723
You know that.

15:56.756 --> 15:59.592
Just wondering what you
think you can accomplish

15:59.626 --> 16:00.660
by being here.

16:00.693 --> 16:03.363
What do you mean, accomplish?

16:03.396 --> 16:05.765
The way you
feel about him.

16:05.798 --> 16:09.436
The things you got
going on inside of you.

16:09.469 --> 16:13.140
You're still going to feel
those same things tomorrow.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.675
Maybe.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.581
Is that why you
brought me out here?

16:21.614 --> 16:25.518
I just want
to protect you, is all.

16:28.088 --> 16:30.290
That's all
any father wants.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.392
(Robert exhales)

16:32.425 --> 16:33.793
Boy, I tried,

16:33.826 --> 16:35.795
but you can't protect
your daughter from everything.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.532
Eventually, the day comes
when you have to pick her up

16:39.566 --> 16:41.434
off the ground
after she skins her knee

16:41.468 --> 16:45.505
and tell her everything's
going to be all right.

16:45.538 --> 16:46.473
Or wipe away the tears

16:46.506 --> 16:48.541
after some boy
breaks her heart.

16:50.743 --> 16:53.413
Find the words to tell her
her mother's gone.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.385
But that's life.

16:58.418 --> 17:02.355
I couldn't teach you everything,
and you wouldn't even let me.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.391
You have your own way
of doing things, but...

17:04.424 --> 17:06.425
I'm not that little girl
anymore, Dad.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.395
I haven't been for a long time.

17:08.428 --> 17:11.531
And I know you're
proud of me,

17:11.564 --> 17:14.067
but I know that you wish
I didn't do what I do.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.303
Or see the
things I see.

17:16.336 --> 17:20.107
That innocence was gone
a long time ago.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.575
And I don't regret
the choices that I've made,

17:22.608 --> 17:25.412
and I don't regret seeing
the things I've seen.

17:25.444 --> 17:29.716
You're an impressive
young woman, Lindsay.

17:29.749 --> 17:33.186
But you grew up so fast.

17:37.257 --> 17:40.727
What I'm trying to say is,
haven't you seen enough?

17:57.210 --> 17:58.545
Oh, let me guess.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.613
"Life is not measured
by the breaths we take

18:00.647 --> 18:03.316
but by the moments
that take our breath away."

18:03.350 --> 18:04.451
That's close.
It's actually,

18:04.484 --> 18:07.820
"Where my party, p-party,
party, p-party people at?"

18:07.854 --> 18:08.621
It's Nelly.

18:08.655 --> 18:11.391
That would have been
my second guess.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.593
What's up with her?
Blonde hair
Hawkes recovered

18:13.626 --> 18:14.327
from the pocket watch.

18:14.361 --> 18:17.597
I ran it for DNA, but no hit.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.498
However, it's, uh,
badly damaged.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.733
It's severely dry,
had a split cortex,

18:20.767 --> 18:22.869
and also has a
slight green tinge.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.837
So, you're thinking it
belonged to a swimmer.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.005
Exactly.

18:26.038 --> 18:29.176
Found traces of chlorine,
copper, iron and manganese,

18:29.209 --> 18:31.311
all of which are found
in a swimming pool.

18:31.344 --> 18:35.448
The length and color are
consistent with Melanie Rogers.

18:35.482 --> 18:36.649
Along with five other
girls on the swim team,

18:36.683 --> 18:38.885
but only one of them
was dating Nate Paulson.

18:38.918 --> 18:41.788
The kid who OD'd
on dextro and alcohol.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.156
Boom.

18:51.598 --> 18:52.632
Impressive last 50 meters.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.401
Thanks.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.269
I'm Jo Danville, crime lab.
This is Detective Flack.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.739
Sorry to hear about
your boyfriend, Nate.
Yeah.

18:59.772 --> 19:02.542
And now, with what's
happened to Luke,

19:02.575 --> 19:03.676
I bet it's been pretty rough.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.478
I've had better weeks.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.547
Luckily, I have this
to keep my mind off of it.

19:07.580 --> 19:10.583
Well, I'm going to need
your mind to think about it

19:10.617 --> 19:11.651
just for a few more moments.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.386
Sorry.

19:13.420 --> 19:17.424
We found over 400 milligrams
of dextro in Nate's system

19:17.457 --> 19:18.525
after he passed away.

19:18.558 --> 19:19.659
He didn't pass away.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.194
He OD'd.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.263
Did you know he was taking it?

19:25.732 --> 19:27.667
He was addicted to it.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.837
One minute he was happy,
the next depressed.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.406
We fought about
practically everything.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.874
He wasn't the same person

19:34.907 --> 19:36.576
as when we first
started dating.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.245
Do you know
where he was getting it?

19:40.747 --> 19:43.283
He was getting it
from Luke, wasn't he?

19:44.351 --> 19:45.685
Did you blame Luke
for Nate's overdose?

19:47.454 --> 19:50.590
We have evidence that puts you
at the crime scene, Melanie.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.592
Things get
out of hand?

19:52.625 --> 19:53.593
You're emotional.

19:53.626 --> 19:54.861
You blame him for Nate.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.697
Hit him in the head
with the coffee mug.

19:57.730 --> 20:00.667
You guys are sick.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.001
You know that?

20:02.034 --> 20:05.004
I went to the library to see
if Luke was all right.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.839
He took Nate's death
pretty hard.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.475
The watch was Nate's.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.910
His grandfather gave it to him.

20:10.943 --> 20:12.745
He carried it with him
everywhere.

20:12.779 --> 20:15.582
I thought Luke
would want it.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.442
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

20:42.475 --> 20:43.643
I haven't even
done anything yet.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.612
CAROLINE:
Lindsay.
How long has it been?

20:45.645 --> 20:47.547
This thing stinks.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.715
Lucy, how long has it been?

20:48.748 --> 20:49.916
I don't know, like,
five minutes.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.451
LINDSAY:
That should be good.

20:51.484 --> 20:52.952
Right?
I-I don't know.

20:52.985 --> 20:53.886
You didn't have a potato

20:53.920 --> 20:55.422
without these things
growing out of it? Look.

20:55.455 --> 20:57.390
Who has the lighter?

20:57.424 --> 20:58.525
What do you need
a lighter for?

20:58.558 --> 20:59.726
To sterilize the needle.

20:59.759 --> 21:00.860
This is a bad idea.

21:00.893 --> 21:02.829
I don't like this one bit.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.464
Caroline, what are you doing?

21:04.497 --> 21:05.832
I'm looking out.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.400
I'm keeping a lookout.

21:07.434 --> 21:08.468
My mom and dad
aren't even home.

21:08.501 --> 21:09.469
I told you that.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.770
Okay, good.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.071
Now give me the rubbing alcohol.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.573
Rubbing alcohol, too?

21:13.606 --> 21:15.608
I just have to get
the rust off of it.
Rust?!

21:15.642 --> 21:17.510
What the hell?!
Shh!
I'm kidding.

21:17.544 --> 21:19.078
You just don't want it
to get infected.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.613
Okay, Lucy.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.682
Hold the potato
behind her ear.

21:24.384 --> 21:25.785
One, two...

21:26.786 --> 21:28.955
(thud)

21:41.100 --> 21:43.102
ROSS:
"Fred goes to the video
store on Broadway."

21:43.135 --> 21:44.804
Fred, you are a moron.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.506
Online video, dude.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.941
"He buys three videos for $25."

21:48.975 --> 21:50.477
God, you're killing me.

21:50.510 --> 21:51.711
"This was $15 more

21:51.744 --> 21:53.780
than twice what he paid
for a box of Goobers."

21:53.813 --> 21:56.883
I would go with Raisinets,
but whatever.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.618
"How much were the Goobers?"

21:58.651 --> 22:01.521
First of all, five bucks for
chocolate covered peanuts?

22:01.554 --> 22:03.723
Second, isn't this kid in, like
AP Calculus?

22:03.756 --> 22:05.792
Yo, you hear
from Lindsay?

22:05.825 --> 22:06.726
No.

22:06.759 --> 22:07.860
What's all this?

22:07.894 --> 22:09.862
Uh, Billy Wharton's
phone records.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.464
Text messages, actually.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.800
Uh, I didn't find any contact
between him and Luke.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.835
These are all basic
algebra problems.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.470
So, they're all like this?

22:17.504 --> 22:18.938
Solve for x,
solve for y,

22:18.971 --> 22:20.907
two trains leave Grand Central?

22:20.940 --> 22:22.975
Yeah, everything
is fairly innocuous.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.143
No sexting, nothing.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.878
It's pretty disappointing.

22:25.912 --> 22:28.948
I would keep digging, because
Mac's not done with this kid.

22:32.719 --> 22:35.021
Bet you're not loving the
fact that you're the one

22:35.054 --> 22:36.856
with the surgeon's hands
around here, are you?

22:36.889 --> 22:38.057
Don't get me started.

22:38.090 --> 22:40.026
What's up?

22:40.059 --> 22:42.028
Find anything in Luke's backpack
that's related to basic algebra?

22:42.061 --> 22:43.796
You know, word problems
or anything like that?

22:43.830 --> 22:45.465
No, not that I
can think of.

22:45.498 --> 22:47.434
Uh, his notebooks
are right there,

22:47.467 --> 22:48.635
if you want to
take a look.

22:48.668 --> 22:49.802
I need a coffee, huh?

22:49.836 --> 22:50.770
You good?
Yeah, I'm good.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.138
Don't worry about it.
Thanks.

23:19.866 --> 23:22.902
Hey, Mac,
you've got to read this.

23:22.935 --> 23:25.605
Check it out, right here.

23:25.638 --> 23:27.874
Open letter to the Times.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.876
"I am a student
at Vernon Academy.

23:29.909 --> 23:33.446
"I feel compelled to bring
to light an epidemic

23:33.480 --> 23:35.648
"that is plaguing the school
that I have attended

23:35.682 --> 23:37.717
since I was in
kindergarten.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.887
"It involves the abuse
of dextroamphetamines.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.723
"I lost a close friend
as a result of this,

23:43.756 --> 23:46.926
and it is incumbent upon..."

23:48.928 --> 23:49.996
It cuts off there.

23:50.029 --> 23:51.798
So Luke wasn't selling
the drugs.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.766
He was going
to blow the whistle.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.121
He looks nervous.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.089
He should be.

24:17.123 --> 24:20.126
Luke was going public
with the dextro abuse.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.896
That's what the fight in the
hallway was about, wasn't it?

24:23.930 --> 24:26.899
He made the story up about
Luke cheating off of him.

24:26.933 --> 24:28.568
Luke confronts him,

24:28.601 --> 24:30.737
maybe gives him one last
out to quit dealing.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.772
Billy tells him
to piss off.

24:37.877 --> 24:41.047
This isn't just
some casual lunch.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.682
If Billy supplied these
kids with dextro,

24:42.715 --> 24:44.517
and Luke was going to go
public with the names,

24:44.551 --> 24:45.852
they all had a
lot to lose.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.486
I'll make sure I
get their names.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.058
FLACK:
Is that Frank?

24:53.092 --> 24:54.193
That's Frank.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.899
What the hell
are you doing, Frank?

24:59.932 --> 25:01.133
This isn't good.

25:03.603 --> 25:04.837
I'm going.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.081
You want to tell me
what you're doing here?

25:15.114 --> 25:16.949
That son of a bitch
killed my son.

25:16.983 --> 25:17.950
We don't know that.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.085
You hear me?

25:19.118 --> 25:20.252
We don't know that.

25:20.286 --> 25:22.254
What's in your pocket?
Nothing.

25:22.288 --> 25:24.757
Take your hand out
of your pocket.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.866
Listen to me, we don't even have
proof that Billy was dealing.

25:33.900 --> 25:34.967
Yes, we do.

25:35.001 --> 25:38.237
I subpoenaed Billy's
psychiatric records.

25:38.270 --> 25:41.874
You don't have probable
cause to do that, Frank.

25:41.908 --> 25:43.610
Judge Spencer
owed me a favor.

25:43.643 --> 25:45.945
Billy goes to four
different psychiatrists.

25:45.978 --> 25:48.715
He fakes the
symptoms for ADHD,

25:48.748 --> 25:50.683
then he gets a prescription
for dextroamphetamines

25:50.717 --> 25:51.784
from all of them.

25:51.818 --> 25:53.285
That's where he gets
the stuff from.

25:53.319 --> 25:55.287
Two of them he
doesn't even...
I don't want
to hear this.

25:55.321 --> 25:57.156
Judge Spencer owed
you a favor?

25:57.189 --> 25:59.125
What are you doing, Frank?
Listen to yourself.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.326
He killed Luke.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.996
You're not only jeopardizing
the investigation,

26:04.030 --> 26:05.331
you're risking your job.

26:05.364 --> 26:07.033
Now let us do what we do.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.901
If Billy did this,
we'll catch him.

26:08.935 --> 26:10.369
The right way--
no favors.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.939
Don't make me go
to your bosses.

26:12.972 --> 26:14.073
Now, go home.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.108
I'll call you later.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.619
(birds twittering)

26:50.877 --> 26:55.347
Okay, ready? Pretend to make
out with your latest crush.

26:55.381 --> 26:58.951
(girls laughing)

27:00.152 --> 27:03.055
(kissing sounds)

27:03.089 --> 27:04.691
Oh, Dillon.
Oh, Dillon.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.292
ALL:
Dillon?

27:06.325 --> 27:07.660
Ew!

27:07.694 --> 27:09.161
Wait, Dillon?
Yeah.

27:09.195 --> 27:11.330
What's wrong with Dillon?
He's cute.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.032
He's got weird teeth--
they're all crooked.

27:13.065 --> 27:14.166
So?

27:14.200 --> 27:16.035
And he wears all black.

27:16.068 --> 27:18.204
I think he's goth
or something.

27:18.237 --> 27:20.306
Ooh, you like bad boys,
don't you?

27:20.339 --> 27:22.108
Maybe.

27:22.141 --> 27:23.275
Cowboys are boring.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.812
You're up.
Red.

27:25.845 --> 27:27.213
R-E-D.

27:27.246 --> 27:28.915
Green.

27:28.948 --> 27:31.718
G-R-E-E-N.

27:31.751 --> 27:34.153
Four.

27:36.889 --> 27:39.191
Truth. What was the
last dream you had?

27:39.225 --> 27:41.160
Are you serious?

27:41.193 --> 27:42.394
That's so lame.

27:42.428 --> 27:43.696
No, I want to hear this.

27:43.730 --> 27:46.065
Okay.

27:46.098 --> 27:47.233
You were all in it.

27:47.266 --> 27:49.168
I dreamed
that we were all seniors

27:49.201 --> 27:51.070
and we all had
our driver's licenses.

27:51.103 --> 27:54.240
Linds, you had
a convertible Trans Am.

27:54.273 --> 27:55.141
A Trans Am?

27:55.174 --> 27:57.076
Ford F250, please.

27:57.109 --> 28:00.046
And we all drove down to
the reservoir to our spot.

28:00.079 --> 28:02.281
We all had our
acceptance letters,

28:02.314 --> 28:03.382
you know, for colleges.

28:03.415 --> 28:05.084
And we opened them up...

28:06.285 --> 28:08.254
...and we all got into
different schools.

28:08.287 --> 28:09.388
Oh, Caroline.

28:09.421 --> 28:11.223
What the hell,
Caroline?

28:11.257 --> 28:13.993
Your last dream, she said,
not your last nightmare.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.262
KELLY:
We're all applying to one
school, and that's it.

28:16.295 --> 28:18.330
And everyone's getting in.

28:18.364 --> 28:19.799
And everyone's going.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.500
Yeah.
Yeah.

28:21.533 --> 28:25.137
(laughter)

28:27.139 --> 28:29.141
(laughter fading)

28:41.320 --> 28:42.922
I'm requesting a
transfer to NSA.

28:42.955 --> 28:44.056
Approved.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.158
I think I did it, Jo.

28:46.192 --> 28:47.459
What exactly did you do?

28:47.493 --> 28:49.295
I cracked his code.
Whose code?

28:49.328 --> 28:51.197
Billy's.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.199
His phone was filled

28:53.232 --> 28:54.233
with these
algebra problems

28:54.266 --> 28:56.803
sent to him by
other students.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.838
They're way too easy
to be actual questions

28:58.871 --> 29:00.139
from students that
are this smart.

29:00.172 --> 29:02.241
Ugh, I was never
very good at these.

29:02.274 --> 29:04.911
The questions are a request
for dextroamphetamines.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.946
And the answer is
how many they want?

29:06.979 --> 29:08.047
Mm-hmm.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.148
So, Billy is dealing.

29:09.181 --> 29:10.783
Yeah, and the
details are all here.

29:10.817 --> 29:11.918
Check this out.

29:11.951 --> 29:13.853
"Jack goes to the
driving range."

29:13.886 --> 29:16.422
Means the deal is going to go
down at the driving range,

29:16.455 --> 29:18.257
most likely
Chelsea Piers.
Okay.

29:18.290 --> 29:21.093
"Buys a bucket of 312 balls."

29:21.127 --> 29:22.895
I mean nobody buys
a bucket of 312 balls.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.931
Your arm would
fall off.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.398
So, the deal is going
to go down at 3:12.

29:26.432 --> 29:28.200
If Jack hits 78 balls
in an hour,

29:28.234 --> 29:31.003
how many hours will it take
for him to hit all 312?

29:32.004 --> 29:34.340
Okay, well, all right.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.275
So, the answer...

29:36.308 --> 29:37.576
don't tell me.

29:37.609 --> 29:42.448
The answer is 312 divided by 78.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.351
Four.
There you go.

29:45.384 --> 29:47.887
That means this person
wants four pills.

29:49.255 --> 29:50.857
But how do you know
who the person is?

29:50.890 --> 29:54.260
Well, this one
was sent by...

29:56.863 --> 29:59.031
Melanie Rogers.

29:59.065 --> 30:00.933
You lied to me, Melanie.

30:00.967 --> 30:03.202
I didn't lie.

30:03.235 --> 30:05.237
You let us believe that Luke
was supplying students

30:05.271 --> 30:07.907
with dextroamphetamines
when you knew all along

30:07.940 --> 30:09.241
it was Billy who was selling.

30:09.275 --> 30:12.111
It's not just Billy.

30:12.144 --> 30:15.214
I can name 20 people,
right now, that sell the stuff.

30:15.247 --> 30:16.582
It's so easy to get.

30:16.615 --> 30:19.118
Most of them have
legitimate prescriptions

30:19.151 --> 30:21.988
or they just go into a shrink,
stare out the window,

30:22.021 --> 30:24.323
and say they're having a hard
time focusing in school.

30:24.356 --> 30:26.325
Why are you taking it?

30:26.358 --> 30:28.427
Such a smart girl.

30:28.460 --> 30:29.495
Because it works.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.132
B-pluses don't cut it anymore.

30:33.165 --> 30:36.068
Not when you're trying
to get into the top schools.

30:36.102 --> 30:40.339
Dextro makes you focus,
study longer.

30:40.372 --> 30:42.341
It works.

30:42.374 --> 30:45.244
Like it worked for Nate?

30:45.277 --> 30:48.014
If you got caught, you were
jeopardizing your whole future.

30:48.047 --> 30:51.350
Everything you'd worked
so hard for.

30:51.383 --> 30:55.321
You had a lot to lose if Luke
went public and named names.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.322
I didn't kill Luke.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.190
Then who did?

30:59.325 --> 31:03.629
All I know is Billy said
he would take care of it.

31:06.465 --> 31:08.134
FLACK:
I'm not seeing him, Adam.

31:08.167 --> 31:09.969
You've got to help me out
here, man.

31:10.002 --> 31:12.104
ROSS (on phone):
You should be
right on top of him.

31:12.138 --> 31:13.105
Well, maybe that's the problem.

31:13.139 --> 31:15.041
I'm right on top of him,
he's on street level.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.275
That I can't help you with.

31:16.308 --> 31:18.377
But the signal indicates...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:18.410 --> 31:19.478
I got him.

31:19.511 --> 31:20.512
Yo!

31:20.546 --> 31:23.315
Heads up.

31:23.349 --> 31:25.017
Hey!

31:25.051 --> 31:28.220
Stop! Police!

31:38.998 --> 31:39.966
FLACK:
Heads up!

31:39.999 --> 31:41.333
Heads up! Look out!

31:42.368 --> 31:43.535
(grunting)

31:43.569 --> 31:45.104
That's it. It's over.

31:45.137 --> 31:46.272
That's it!

32:01.320 --> 32:03.089
LUCY:
That one.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.423
I'd go to that one.

32:04.456 --> 32:07.426
The really bright
one straight ahead.

32:07.459 --> 32:09.395
That's the North Star.

32:09.428 --> 32:12.398
You know because the
Big Dipper points to it.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.433
See?

32:14.466 --> 32:16.535
Do you think you'll
ever leave here?

32:16.568 --> 32:18.537
Montana?

32:18.570 --> 32:21.073
And go where?

32:21.107 --> 32:22.508
Yeah, I don't know.

32:22.541 --> 32:25.477
Anywhere.

32:28.247 --> 32:30.382
No.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.284
I like it here.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.355
I will.

32:36.388 --> 32:38.524
One day.

32:38.557 --> 32:41.427
I like how big
it is out there.

32:46.432 --> 32:48.200
You heading over?

32:48.234 --> 32:50.436
Yeah.

32:50.469 --> 32:53.372
Well, you know where I stand
on this, but...

32:53.405 --> 32:55.341
you're my daughter,
and I love you.

32:55.374 --> 32:58.044
If you want me
to go with you...

32:59.145 --> 33:00.646
...I'll go with you.

33:00.679 --> 33:03.349
I love you, too, Dad.

33:07.453 --> 33:09.088
I've got to do this on my own.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.526
FLACK:
So how are things
going with Dr. Renway?

33:14.560 --> 33:16.528
Or Dr. Overbrook.

33:16.562 --> 33:19.298
Or... Dr. Parkston.

33:19.331 --> 33:22.401
Or Dr. Gleeson.

33:22.434 --> 33:26.138
Selling dextroamphetamines
is a felony, Billy,

33:26.172 --> 33:28.574
and you're looking at I don't
even know how many counts.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.576
But I'm guessing Harvard
will not be impressed

33:30.609 --> 33:33.445
with your
entrepreneurial skills.

33:33.479 --> 33:34.546
You sold to Nate Paulson,
didn't you?

33:34.580 --> 33:36.148
Didn't matter how
much he wanted,

33:36.182 --> 33:39.418
or how out of control
his addiction was,

33:39.451 --> 33:41.420
you just kept
selling to him.

33:41.453 --> 33:42.421
And Luke blamed you
for his death,

33:42.454 --> 33:44.356
that's what the fight
was about, wasn't it?

33:44.390 --> 33:46.158
He told you he was going
to blow the whistle.

33:46.192 --> 33:47.659
But you nipped that
in the bud, huh?

33:47.693 --> 33:49.628
You found him in the library.

33:51.797 --> 33:53.532
Let me guess: you want a lawyer.

33:53.565 --> 33:54.533
No.

33:57.336 --> 33:58.604
I want to trade.

33:59.605 --> 34:02.341
Trade? Trade what?

34:02.374 --> 34:04.310
Mr. Connors.

34:04.343 --> 34:05.577
What are you doing with these?

34:06.612 --> 34:07.613
We use them as study aids.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.514
I mean, to focus,
to stay up late.

34:09.547 --> 34:10.849
Not to get high
or anything.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.184
We?

34:12.217 --> 34:14.386
Half the school uses them.

34:14.420 --> 34:16.388
Your, your champion
debate guys.

34:16.422 --> 34:19.257
The prized pupils at
the front of the class.

34:19.291 --> 34:20.726
Ever wonder how all
those B-pluses turn to A's?

34:22.128 --> 34:23.462
So, now what?

34:23.495 --> 34:25.831
Nothing. Get out of here.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.810
*

34:51.389 --> 34:52.591
You were able to pull those
off the murder weapon?

34:52.623 --> 34:54.126
Yeah. Infrared images.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.194
There were too many cracks

34:55.226 --> 34:56.395
to see a usable
print with powder.

34:57.629 --> 34:59.265
But as you can see,
even with infrared,

34:59.298 --> 35:01.300
there's too much separation and
breaks within key points.

35:01.333 --> 35:03.535
It would never hold up in court.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.705
How are you with Photoshop?

35:08.574 --> 35:10.609
Build the missing ridges
and print it out for me.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.611
Maybe we won't need it
to hold up in court.

35:16.182 --> 35:18.184
(buzzer sounds)

35:19.551 --> 35:22.154
(door clanging shut)

35:44.643 --> 35:47.413
The one who got away.

35:49.448 --> 35:50.849
A lot of nerve
showing up here.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.255
I'm guessing you've got
something to say,

35:56.288 --> 35:57.523
so why don't you
have a seat, huh?

35:57.556 --> 36:01.793
How much money did you get out
of the cash register that day?

36:03.895 --> 36:06.265
How much?

36:06.298 --> 36:10.602
I want to know how much those
lives were worth to you.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.606
This is going to be a
disappointing little discussion.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.808
For both of us.

36:16.842 --> 36:19.511
You were at the trial.

36:19.545 --> 36:21.813
You heard me then, hear me now.

36:21.847 --> 36:23.682
It wasn't me.

36:23.715 --> 36:25.584
You I.D.'d the wrong guy.

36:25.617 --> 36:27.986
Right.

36:28.019 --> 36:31.290
Yeah, I read your appeals.

36:31.323 --> 36:34.293
They're all based
on the unreliability

36:34.326 --> 36:35.527
of a single eyewitness.

36:35.561 --> 36:38.530
16 years go by,

36:38.564 --> 36:41.267
you waltz into that courtroom
and point your finger at me?

36:42.501 --> 36:43.769
Please.

36:43.802 --> 36:46.238
I feel sorry for you.

36:47.639 --> 36:48.674
I do.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.476
Why did you come here?

36:50.509 --> 36:52.411
What is it that you want, huh?

36:52.444 --> 36:55.781
Absolution?

36:55.814 --> 36:59.551
You want this off
your conscience?

36:59.585 --> 37:01.820
You came to the wrong place,
little girl.

37:01.853 --> 37:05.491
All these years.

37:05.524 --> 37:07.626
All the appeals.

37:07.659 --> 37:08.794
All the denials.

37:10.696 --> 37:11.763
What if we argue this?

37:11.797 --> 37:14.633
What if we argue that?

37:14.666 --> 37:18.870
You still can't state
the simple truth.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.486
You've had quite a
year, Mr. Connors.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.955
2011 Teacher of the Year.

37:36.988 --> 37:41.560
And awards for excellence
from New York universities

37:41.593 --> 37:43.895
honoring high school teachers.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.631
One for $5,000.

37:47.499 --> 37:48.834
Coach of the debate team
champions.

37:48.867 --> 37:50.469
Some would think
you deserve a raise.

37:50.502 --> 37:51.937
The administration did.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.939
I've been very fortunate, yes.

37:53.972 --> 37:56.274
But it also was
a lot of hard work.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.611
I'm sure it was.

37:59.645 --> 38:02.981
I don't doubt that you're
a damn fine teacher.

38:04.850 --> 38:07.986
But you have a responsibility
that transcends good grades

38:08.019 --> 38:11.590
and churning out
Ivy League students.

38:11.623 --> 38:14.926
You have a responsibility
to safeguard the welfare

38:14.960 --> 38:16.795
of the kids
who walk these halls.

38:16.828 --> 38:20.932
I'm not sure I understand
what you're getting at.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.768
Oh, I think you do.

38:22.801 --> 38:25.704
We had a chat
with Billy Wharton.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.373
CONNORS:
Luke!

38:27.406 --> 38:29.341
Luke.

38:29.375 --> 38:30.876
What has gotten into you, son?

38:36.147 --> 38:38.517
What the hell was
that all about?

38:38.550 --> 38:40.419
He knows.
Knows what?

38:40.452 --> 38:42.087
That I sell my stuff.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.355
He says it's gone too far.

38:43.389 --> 38:45.724
He's going to go public,
to the Times or something.

38:45.757 --> 38:47.426
What exactly did he say?
I don't know.

38:47.459 --> 38:48.927
But you better fix it.

38:48.960 --> 38:52.998
Because if I go down,
you're going down with me.

38:55.901 --> 38:58.737
You couldn't afford to let Luke
go to the media with his story.

38:58.770 --> 39:01.373
I didn't touch Luke.

39:01.407 --> 39:04.810
No. But you did touch this.

39:09.648 --> 39:13.652
I just wanted him
to consider how many lives

39:13.685 --> 39:18.624
would be affected
if he went forward with this.

39:21.927 --> 39:24.763
CONNORS:
Luke, consider what
you're doing, son.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.532
Don't call me "son."

39:26.565 --> 39:29.134
Billy told me that you know.

39:29.167 --> 39:30.469
It's more complicated than that.

39:30.502 --> 39:31.803
No. No, it isn't.

39:31.837 --> 39:33.839
You should have said
something a long time ago.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.874
And I should have
said something.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.075
They'll fire me.

39:37.108 --> 39:39.144
I'll lose my job.

39:39.177 --> 39:40.812
I have a family.

39:40.846 --> 39:41.747
A daughter.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.649
You should have thought
about that before.

39:43.682 --> 39:44.850
I'm begging you, son.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.718
Don't do this.

39:46.752 --> 39:48.119
I've been at this school
for 12 years.

39:48.153 --> 39:49.755
I've known you since
you were in kindergarten.

39:49.788 --> 39:50.856
Think of the other students.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.090
The futures that are at stake.

39:52.123 --> 39:53.925
What about Nate?

39:53.959 --> 39:56.528
What about his future?

39:56.562 --> 39:58.063
I have to live
the rest of my life

39:58.096 --> 39:59.631
with the guilt of...
of not saying anything.

39:59.665 --> 40:00.866
And so should you.

40:20.919 --> 40:24.856
Don't pretend you're concerned
about your students.

40:24.890 --> 40:28.594
The only future you were
concerned about was your own.

40:28.627 --> 40:30.629
(handcuffs clicking)

40:46.277 --> 40:48.146
I'm sorry.

40:59.157 --> 41:01.159

41:22.581 --> 41:24.182
(door closes)

41:38.029 --> 41:41.199
WARDEN:
Daniel Katums, do you
have any last words?

41:47.873 --> 41:51.276
I'm sorry
for what I've done.

42:08.994 --> 42:12.931
(girls screaming, gunshots)

42:32.317 --> 42:36.321
(laughter)

43:09.120 --> 43:10.255
(car door closes)

43:10.288 --> 43:13.191
(engine starting)
