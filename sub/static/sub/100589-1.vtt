16:29.281 --> 16:31.825
MARY BETH:
Pris?

16:31.909 --> 16:34.119
(gasps)

16:34.203 --> 16:36.246
(Priscilla shuddering)

16:36.330 --> 16:37.956
(shower running)

16:48.425 --> 16:49.885
PRISCILLA:
Can you start over?

16:49.968 --> 16:51.470
I’m confused.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.931
MARY BETH:
It was confusing.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.599
PRISCILLA:
But you had to do it, right?

16:55.682 --> 16:57.935
You... Mary Beth,
you had to do it, right?

16:58.018 --> 16:59.311
MARY BETH:
I don’t know.

16:59.394 --> 17:02.731
(shower continues running)

17:02.814 --> 17:04.858
What do you mean,
you don’t know?

17:04.942 --> 17:07.528
I lost control with...

17:07.611 --> 17:09.446
the brick.

17:09.530 --> 17:10.906
PRISCILLA:
Brick?

17:12.324 --> 17:14.326
You said it was a harpoon.

17:14.409 --> 17:16.787
Oh, shit, I’m so screwed.

17:16.870 --> 17:19.456
Mary Beth, you said
it was a harpoon.

17:19.540 --> 17:22.042
Are you gonna call the police?

17:26.338 --> 17:28.257
(shower continues running)

17:30.050 --> 17:31.301
(rapid beeping)

17:31.385 --> 17:33.595
(line ringing)

17:46.108 --> 17:48.235
MAN (over phone):
Easter Cove PD.

17:51.989 --> 17:54.116
-(knob creaks)
-(shower stops)

17:55.993 --> 17:58.203
Get dressed.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.845
(engine starts)

18:14.928 --> 18:16.972
(tires squeal)

18:35.115 --> 18:37.492
(grunting, panting)

18:48.629 --> 18:49.505
Okay.

18:49.588 --> 18:51.173
You ready?

18:51.256 --> 18:53.133
We got to lift him together.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.804
(grunting):
One, two, three.

18:58.847 --> 19:00.182
(Mary Beth gasps)

19:00.265 --> 19:02.601
(gags, pants)

19:02.684 --> 19:05.687
(whimpers)
Pris, I can’t. Fuck.

19:05.771 --> 19:07.022
Coleslaw.

19:07.105 --> 19:08.357
What?

19:08.440 --> 19:10.067
Mrs. Egan’s coleslaw.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.860
The whitest,
goopiest shit ever.

19:11.944 --> 19:13.195
I hate coleslaw.

19:13.278 --> 19:14.613
Yeah, but when
Adam what’s-his-name

19:14.696 --> 19:16.949
called you a pussy,
you ate the whole thing.

19:17.032 --> 19:18.242
And you licked the spoon even.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.409
It was disgusting.

19:19.493 --> 19:21.620
But you got it down,
didn’t you?

19:24.665 --> 19:26.208
Okay.

19:28.544 --> 19:30.546
(inhales deeply)

19:30.629 --> 19:32.339
(exhales slowly)

19:32.422 --> 19:34.258
(sighs)

19:34.341 --> 19:36.885
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

19:38.095 --> 19:40.722
(grunting)

19:42.683 --> 19:45.269
(both panting)

19:47.604 --> 19:48.856
PRISCILLA:
Shit.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.666
(both grunting)

20:07.749 --> 20:09.459
-PRISCILLA: Push.
-I don’t know if he’s gonna fit.

20:09.543 --> 20:10.669
PRISCILLA:
It’ll fit.

20:10.752 --> 20:12.504
MARY BETH: The knees, though--
can’t bend enough.

20:12.588 --> 20:14.214
Should we take his shoes off?

20:14.298 --> 20:15.299
No.

20:15.382 --> 20:16.717
-No, push the top down.
-Oops.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.343
Shit.

20:18.427 --> 20:19.970
Just push it in.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.430
-(screams)
-(grunts)

20:21.513 --> 20:24.725
(both grunting)

20:24.808 --> 20:26.435
-Oh, my God.
-Damn it!

20:26.518 --> 20:29.438
(both panting)

20:39.740 --> 20:41.992
We should have just
called the police.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.785
Don’t.

20:47.497 --> 20:50.000
I mean, what are we
supposed to do, Pris?

20:50.083 --> 20:52.085
Just chop his arms off?

21:24.576 --> 21:26.620
(joint creaking)

21:29.790 --> 21:32.167
Fucking coleslaw.

21:34.253 --> 21:36.505
(waves crashing)

21:54.773 --> 21:56.984
(waves continue crashing)

22:08.203 --> 22:11.039
(both panting)

22:11.123 --> 22:12.207
Ready?

22:12.291 --> 22:13.375
On the count of three.

22:13.458 --> 22:16.336
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

Morning, Coletti.

23:34.206 --> 23:36.041
Morning, Justin.

23:36.124 --> 23:37.793
Or should I say
Officer Brennan?

23:37.876 --> 23:39.378
-(laughing)
-JUSTIN: Morning, ladies.

23:39.461 --> 23:40.838
How’s the day looking?

23:40.921 --> 23:42.714
DOREEN:
Not good for Cap’n Dick.

23:42.798 --> 23:44.091
Better get to work.

23:44.174 --> 23:45.717
COLETTI: Hey, take it easy
on my protégé.

23:45.801 --> 23:47.553
I’ll have to take you in.

23:47.636 --> 23:48.846
-(scoffs)
-(Susie laughs)

23:48.929 --> 23:50.973
What a flirt.

Lord help us.

Holy shit, it’s freezing.
Fuck.

24:21.170 --> 24:22.504
You’re gonna catch a cold.

24:22.588 --> 24:24.715
Didn’t I buy you stockings?

24:24.798 --> 24:26.800
Fucking waited for Gorski.

24:26.884 --> 24:28.552
And called his cell.

24:28.635 --> 24:30.679
No-show.

24:30.762 --> 24:33.182
You walk home
looking like that?

24:33.265 --> 24:35.142
Anyone see you?

24:35.225 --> 24:36.894
I mean, just some old ladies.

24:36.977 --> 24:39.354
Oh, great.

24:39.438 --> 24:41.273
(blows, chuckles)

24:41.356 --> 24:43.233
Geez, Enid.

24:43.317 --> 24:45.652
Ever think about redecorating?

24:45.736 --> 24:48.906
You’re, like, way overdue
for a makeover.

24:50.741 --> 24:52.784
None of your business,
Martha Stewart.

24:52.868 --> 24:55.746
(mock babbling)

24:55.829 --> 24:57.998
I’m just saying, like,
treat yourself.

(door opens, bell jingles)

26:32.634 --> 26:34.720
Hey.

26:34.803 --> 26:37.639
I took out the trash.
I did the laundry.

26:37.723 --> 26:39.516
I bleached the tub.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.643
(quietly):
We’re gonna get caught.

26:41.727 --> 26:42.936
Why?

26:43.020 --> 26:44.980
I can’t find the knife.

26:45.063 --> 26:48.025
It says "Connolly Fish" on it.

26:48.108 --> 26:50.068
Did you see me pick it up?

26:50.152 --> 26:52.362
Mm, no, but, I mean,
we were really careful.

26:52.446 --> 26:54.990
Yeah, well, not careful enough.

26:55.073 --> 26:56.200
If Mom knew about this...

26:56.283 --> 26:57.784
Okay, Pris,
just calm down, damn it.

26:57.868 --> 26:59.161
-What are we gonna do?
-Uh...

26:59.244 --> 27:00.370
-(door opens, bell jingles)
-JUSTIN: Hello?

27:00.454 --> 27:02.247

-Okay. Y-You stay.
-Okay.
-(door closes, bell jingles)

27:04.124 --> 27:06.251
-I’ll go.
-Okay.
-JUSTIN: Hello?

27:09.087 --> 27:10.297
Mm, uh...

27:10.380 --> 27:12.591
Priscilla Connolly?

27:14.718 --> 27:16.595
Officer Coletti sent me here.

27:16.678 --> 27:18.680
You-you have a...
a small skiff, right?

27:18.764 --> 27:20.516
Yeah.

27:20.599 --> 27:22.392
Think we could borrow it?

27:22.476 --> 27:24.394
Sorry, we’re just...
we’re in a real squeeze.

27:24.478 --> 27:26.480
We’re just looking
for a Good Samaritan.

27:34.947 --> 27:36.323
(sniffs)

27:36.406 --> 27:37.366
Chilly.

27:39.284 --> 27:42.287
You guys had this boat
in the family for a while?

27:45.040 --> 27:46.917
-Sorry, Officer.
-Oh.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.669
(chuckling):
Please, uh, call me Justin.

27:48.752 --> 27:50.128
Um, Justin Brennan.

27:50.212 --> 27:52.965
We went to County High
together.

27:53.048 --> 27:56.051
Your sister, she used to
prank-call my buddy Paulie

27:56.134 --> 27:58.053
all-all the time.

27:58.136 --> 27:59.763
It drove him nuts.

28:04.560 --> 28:06.270
(chuckles)

28:07.855 --> 28:09.481
Uh...

28:11.108 --> 28:14.069
J-Just so you know,
it-it could get a little grody.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.947
H-How do you mean?

28:17.030 --> 28:19.324
A body washed up on the rocks.

28:19.408 --> 28:21.785
(voice muffled, fading):
Um, we can’t get it from shore,

28:21.869 --> 28:24.872
and we can’t get it
with the big boats, so, uh,

28:24.955 --> 28:27.958
this little guy
is the best tool for the job.

28:28.041 --> 28:30.210
(Priscilla breathing shakily)

28:33.338 --> 28:35.048
JUSTIN:
Oh, you-you ran the food drive

28:35.132 --> 28:37.551
at Thanksgiving, yeah?

28:37.634 --> 28:39.553
Uh, your-your posters worked,
so you know.

28:39.636 --> 28:42.431
I-I brought ten cans
of Chef Boyardee.

28:42.514 --> 28:45.642
Filled up the... grocery bags.

28:49.313 --> 28:51.273
COLETTI:
Our chariot arrives!

28:58.530 --> 29:00.073
-JUSTIN: Watch your step.
-(Priscilla grunts)

29:00.157 --> 29:01.825
COLETTI:
All right. Come on, Brennan.

29:01.909 --> 29:03.827
I know she’s cute.

29:03.911 --> 29:05.495
-JUSTIN: You’re not coming?
-COLETTI: Oh, no.

29:05.579 --> 29:06.705
Not with my knees.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.207
I’ll stay here
with your girlfriend.

29:08.290 --> 29:10.000
JUSTIN:
All right.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.553
(birds screeching)

29:50.040 --> 29:52.334
(boat engine revving)

29:52.417 --> 29:54.670
(boat approaching)

29:56.505 --> 29:59.174
(shuddering breaths)

30:34.459 --> 30:36.628
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

30:39.715 --> 30:42.593
GAIL: Enid’s business is
bringing shame to the town.

30:42.676 --> 30:44.219
It’s bringing shame to us.

30:44.303 --> 30:46.263
SUSIE: Well, Mary Margaret
assured us that all we...

30:46.346 --> 30:48.765
GAIL:
Mary Margaret’s not here, Suze.

30:48.849 --> 30:51.101
It’s now between us and Enid.

30:51.185 --> 30:53.103
I can’t turn
a blind eye anymore.

30:53.187 --> 30:54.605
-Can you?
-(Bob clears throat)

30:58.066 --> 30:59.735
I dropped my fork.

30:59.818 --> 31:01.820
Oh, sure, hon.

31:03.906 --> 31:06.408
-How the Pats doing, Bob?
-(Bob groans)

31:06.491 --> 31:08.994
They’re not giving Brady
any protection.

31:09.077 --> 31:11.371
They’re playing like
a bunch of nuns. Thank you.

31:11.455 --> 31:13.832
(Susie laughing)

31:24.343 --> 31:29.014
Enid’s crossed a line,
and something needs to change.

31:30.557 --> 31:33.310
Mary Margaret was
a loyal friend,

31:33.393 --> 31:35.187
God rest her soul,

31:35.270 --> 31:39.441
but she’s not here
to defend Enid anymore.

31:39.525 --> 31:41.985
And even if she was,

31:42.069 --> 31:44.947
I’d like to think
Mary Margaret would agree.

31:46.823 --> 31:50.160
Oceanview has run its course.

31:51.495 --> 31:53.288
(door slides open)

32:29.283 --> 32:31.451
-(chatter outside)
-(Mary Beth gasps)

32:38.876 --> 32:41.795

32:45.799 --> 32:47.759
-(vehicle door closes)
-(engine starts)

32:47.843 --> 32:50.470
(vehicle departing)

33:01.023 --> 33:02.524
(gasps softly)

33:27.424 --> 33:29.343
(door opens, bell jingles)

33:29.426 --> 33:31.553
DOREEN:
Hello, Rayleen.

33:31.637 --> 33:33.013
How’s Kimmie? (chuckles)

33:33.096 --> 33:34.598
I want to see
those prom pictures.

33:34.681 --> 33:35.766
WOMAN:
Four more minutes, hon.

33:35.849 --> 33:37.935
DOREEN:
Hi, Julie.

33:38.018 --> 33:40.062
Hi, Enid.

33:40.145 --> 33:43.440
Gail, Doreen, Suze, hello.

33:43.524 --> 33:44.983
Paul Mitchell. Huh.

33:45.067 --> 33:47.694
-Fancy.
-ENID: I get it. I get it.

33:47.778 --> 33:49.488
You saw one of my girls
walking home

33:49.571 --> 33:51.406
looking like
a lady of the night.

33:51.490 --> 33:54.284
My guy’s M.I.A.
Won’t happen again.

33:54.368 --> 33:56.161
SUSIE:
No, Enid, no.

33:56.245 --> 33:57.955
A young woman was found dead
in the harbor.

33:58.038 --> 33:59.414
GAIL:
Bullet wound, track marks.

33:59.498 --> 34:00.999
And we know she worked
at Oceanview.

34:01.083 --> 34:02.251
DOREEN:
We’ve been asking ourselves,

34:02.334 --> 34:03.418
who could have done this?

34:03.502 --> 34:05.170
What is this, the Inquisition?

34:05.254 --> 34:08.423
SUSIE: Enid, do you ever
think about retiring?

34:08.507 --> 34:10.050
We were just thinking about

34:10.133 --> 34:12.845
some sort of travel club
together.

34:12.928 --> 34:16.390
Go to Boca Raton,
drink mai tais,

34:16.473 --> 34:18.058
get an Irish tan.

34:18.141 --> 34:21.228
Not ready to go
full vegetable yet, Suze.

34:21.311 --> 34:23.522
Maybe it’s time for a change.

34:25.899 --> 34:28.151
You want to shut down
my business?

34:28.235 --> 34:30.779
SUSIE:
No, just adjust.

34:30.863 --> 34:33.282
I can help you spruce up
the B and B,

34:33.365 --> 34:34.867
clean things up, you know.

34:34.950 --> 34:36.827
Boy, you didn’t waste any time.

34:36.910 --> 34:39.329
Mary Margaret’s been in the
grave what, not even a day?

34:39.413 --> 34:41.582
Don’t try and pull
the Mary Margaret card here.

34:41.665 --> 34:44.459
-Now, she was a real friend.
-Too bad you were too busy

34:44.543 --> 34:47.588
to visit her in the hospital
or attend the funeral.

34:47.671 --> 34:49.548
But it must be hard
for you to step foot

34:49.631 --> 34:50.757
-in a church.
-Careful, Gail.

34:50.841 --> 34:52.384
You’re making
your frown lines worse.

34:52.467 --> 34:54.386
-DOREEN: Enid.
-ENID: No, Dor.

34:54.469 --> 34:56.763
You come in here telling me
one of my dearest girls

34:56.847 --> 34:58.515
is dead, and I’m a little upset.

34:58.599 --> 35:00.684
Oh, you know which girl?

35:03.687 --> 35:06.273
I pay Rayleen good money
for a cut and color

35:06.356 --> 35:08.567
and some much needed
peace and quiet.

35:08.650 --> 35:11.236
So kindly get on
with your afternoon

35:11.320 --> 35:14.406
of casseroles and crochet,
’cause when I leave here,

35:14.489 --> 35:17.784
I-I have a goddamn
business to run.

35:27.336 --> 35:29.338
(bell dings)

35:36.178 --> 35:38.680
I saw your car.

35:38.764 --> 35:40.390
Gorski!

35:40.474 --> 35:43.393
Geez, you’re making me
look bad!

36:24.685 --> 36:26.603

She didn’t drown.

she has you working today

41:48.842 --> 41:51.553
-All cops like to work out.
-Okay.

41:51.637 --> 41:54.181
Enid, tell your girls
to take it easy on him.

41:54.264 --> 41:56.266
-He’s a good Catholic boy.
-TANYA: Aw.

41:56.350 --> 41:58.227
Um, Ms. Devlin, can you tell us

41:58.310 --> 42:01.188
about the last time
you saw Dee McAnniff?

42:02.439 --> 42:03.982
Tanya, uh, go watch TV.

42:04.066 --> 42:06.944
I TiVo’d some Buffy.

42:07.027 --> 42:08.779
All right.

42:12.491 --> 42:14.826
(Enid sighs)

42:14.910 --> 42:16.453
Tragic thing.

42:16.537 --> 42:20.082
I try to protect these girls,
but I can’t do everything.

42:21.625 --> 42:24.127
I think she may have been
too wrapped up with the drugs.

42:24.211 --> 42:26.129
It’s a shame.

42:26.213 --> 42:27.673
Um...

42:27.756 --> 42:30.217
would you mind telling us
how long she was using?

42:30.300 --> 42:32.886
Not in my department, honey.

42:32.970 --> 42:35.556
But it’s not the worst lead.

42:37.933 --> 42:41.687
Enid, what about this fella
that manages for you?

42:41.770 --> 42:43.856
Weirdo, not from Easter Cove.

42:43.939 --> 42:46.024
ENID: Gorski.
Well, he’s a harmless sap.

42:46.108 --> 42:47.609
COLETTI:
Do you know where he lives?

42:47.693 --> 42:49.611
Afraid not.

42:51.154 --> 42:53.740
But if Gorski had anything
to do with this,

42:53.824 --> 42:57.953
I’d never forgive myself for
bringing him into this house.

42:58.036 --> 42:59.454
Oh... (sighs)

42:59.538 --> 43:01.290
Thank you for looking
into this, Coletti.

43:02.499 --> 43:04.209
You’re a good man.

43:05.878 --> 43:08.422
Ooh, boy, what a woman.

43:12.634 --> 43:16.013
Enid Nora Devlin.
(chuckles)

43:21.935 --> 43:24.897
She was hot shit
back in the day. (chuckles)

43:24.980 --> 43:27.774
Yeah, well... she didn’t seem
too upset, though.

43:27.858 --> 43:29.443
You know,
and she didn’t give us

43:29.526 --> 43:31.278
a whole lot to work on, either.

43:31.361 --> 43:33.989
You have eyes, my child,
but you cannot see.

43:34.072 --> 43:37.326
She didn’t say his name,
but she was definitely

43:37.409 --> 43:39.494
pointing me
toward Declan Crawley.

43:40.662 --> 43:41.872
Declan Crawley, that’s the...

43:41.955 --> 43:43.373
that’s the guy
that runs The Desert?

43:43.457 --> 43:45.834
Yeah, a lot of stuff
goes in and out of there,

43:45.918 --> 43:48.170
if you know what I mean.

43:49.338 --> 43:51.131

43:51.215 --> 43:52.508

43:58.222 --> 43:59.723
Priscilla?

43:59.806 --> 44:01.058
We can’t afford to deal with

44:01.141 --> 44:02.976
this made-in-China
piece of garbage.

44:03.060 --> 44:05.771
-Uh, Pris?
-Did you find it?

44:05.854 --> 44:07.981
Uh... the knife?

44:08.065 --> 44:10.901
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

44:10.984 --> 44:13.487
Yeah, yeah, yes, I found it.

44:13.570 --> 44:15.405
I threw it off Kernwood Bridge.

44:15.489 --> 44:17.157

Okay.

44:18.575 --> 44:20.285
Yeah.

be him in the water.

45:04.496 --> 45:07.833
You make a better door
than a window.

45:07.916 --> 45:10.127
We won’t take up
much of your time.

45:10.210 --> 45:13.213
Just need to ask you
about this Gorski fella.

45:13.297 --> 45:15.048
No jelly.

45:15.132 --> 45:17.217
Well, there should be.

45:23.265 --> 45:25.684
Mr. Crawley.

45:25.767 --> 45:29.563
You’re Tim Crawley’s dad,
aren’t you?

45:29.646 --> 45:31.315
Uh, I tell you,
I-I’ll never forget

45:31.398 --> 45:32.858
that Thanksgiving game
my senior year.

45:32.941 --> 45:35.068
(chuckling): You want to talk
about a Hail Mary.

45:35.152 --> 45:37.070
(scoffs) Nobody thought
he would catch that one.

45:37.154 --> 45:38.697
Yeah, unbelievable play.

45:38.780 --> 45:39.948
You played with Timbo?

45:40.032 --> 45:41.575
I ran the scoreboard.

45:41.658 --> 45:43.702
Uh, listen, Mr. Crawley,
if you got any information

45:43.785 --> 45:45.871
about Gorski, we’d be happy
to get out of your hair,

45:45.954 --> 45:48.624
-let you watch your game here.
-Well, did you go by his place?

45:48.707 --> 45:49.875
COLETTI:
You got an address?

45:51.835 --> 45:54.546
Yeah, Enid had me open up
an old shack.

45:54.630 --> 45:57.758
Far end of Marsh Lane.

45:57.841 --> 45:59.343
Enid.

45:59.426 --> 46:01.929
DECLAN: Hey, give me a call
when you find him.

46:02.012 --> 46:03.889
(scoffs)
Hell, he’s up and vanished

46:03.972 --> 46:06.266
like a fart in the wind.

46:09.895 --> 46:11.104
How are you?

46:15.692 --> 46:17.611
I’m on break, Officer.

46:17.694 --> 46:19.655
Talk to Tanya.

46:31.792 --> 46:33.836
Hey, sorry to bother you.

46:33.919 --> 46:35.921
You seemed upset
at the Oceanview.

46:36.004 --> 46:37.840
Were you close with Dee?

46:37.923 --> 46:40.300
(sighs)

46:40.384 --> 46:42.427
You happen to know
where she was from

46:42.511 --> 46:44.638
or how she ended up there?

46:47.641 --> 46:50.435
Hey, look, I’m just trying
to find whoever did this

46:50.519 --> 46:52.729
before they can do it
to someone else, all right?

46:56.066 --> 47:00.237
Yeah, her family’s
in Lowell, Mass.

47:00.320 --> 47:03.574
But she was living in Lynn
when Gorski picked her up.

47:06.076 --> 47:08.161
And, uh, Gorski--

47:08.245 --> 47:10.706
did he pick you up, too?

47:13.917 --> 47:16.211
Did Dee owe anyone money?

47:16.295 --> 47:18.505
People owed her
fucking money, guy.

47:18.589 --> 47:19.590
What people?

47:19.673 --> 47:22.384
-Your fucking mother.
-Okay.

47:22.467 --> 47:24.887
Please, was there anyone
who was upset with her?

47:24.970 --> 47:26.930
Any-Any-Anyone who wanted
to cause her harm?

47:28.682 --> 47:29.975
PAULIE (laughing):
Brennan.

47:31.101 --> 47:32.811
You bastard.

47:32.895 --> 47:35.606
I love that sexy cop outfit.
Where’s your stripper pole?

47:35.689 --> 47:37.399
Jesus, Paulie, I’m trying
to fucking work here.

47:37.482 --> 47:39.943
Okay. Okay. Rough day?

47:41.486 --> 47:43.030
(sighing):
Yeah...

47:43.113 --> 47:46.283
Yeah, just...
a little cold is all.

47:47.701 --> 47:50.996
-(buoy bells clanging)
-(distant thunder rumbling)

48:03.217 --> 48:04.968
(horn honks)

48:06.637 --> 48:08.764
SUSIE:
It’s just me, honey.

48:08.847 --> 48:10.432
I’m just returning your jacket.

48:12.142 --> 48:14.686
We’re here if you want to talk.

48:54.268 --> 48:56.061
(paper rustling)

48:56.144 --> 48:58.272
(chuckles, sniffles)

49:00.315 --> 49:02.484
-(rain pattering outside)

49:10.784 --> 49:11.952
(phone beeps)

49:12.035 --> 49:13.245
DEE (recorded):
Hey. (chuckles)

49:14.580 --> 49:16.290
What are you doing?

49:16.373 --> 49:19.126
(sighs) Lexie.

49:19.209 --> 49:22.254
I love you so much.
You know that?

49:22.337 --> 49:24.339
Wish you’d pick up your phone.

49:24.423 --> 49:26.133
(phone beeps)

49:52.868 --> 49:54.661
(knocking)

49:56.788 --> 49:59.124
Chowder from Gurnet’s.

49:59.208 --> 50:01.251
Better than anything
you can cook.

50:03.086 --> 50:04.630
Thank you.

50:08.717 --> 50:10.177
ENID:
Here we go.

50:10.260 --> 50:12.012
-I can help.
-Oh, no, no, no.

50:12.095 --> 50:15.224
-I’ll get that.
-Are you sure?

50:15.307 --> 50:16.683
ENID:
Ah!

50:16.767 --> 50:19.436
I remember these.
(laughs)

50:19.520 --> 50:22.606
Your mother used to slip
a flask in the side

50:22.689 --> 50:25.317
and sneak booze out of
your granddad’s cabinet.

50:25.400 --> 50:27.361
That doesn’t sound like Ma.

50:27.444 --> 50:30.739
Ah, she was the worst,
your mother.

50:33.492 --> 50:36.078
But we never got caught.

50:36.161 --> 50:37.955
For anything.

50:40.874 --> 50:43.877
A lot of people
underestimate young women.

50:46.380 --> 50:49.424
That’s why they can get away
with a lot.

50:53.011 --> 50:55.722
We had a good run,
your mother and I.

50:55.806 --> 50:57.516
Made a lot of money, too.

51:00.811 --> 51:03.814
She was a natural
businesswoman.

51:06.108 --> 51:08.110
You worked at the fish shop?

51:09.903 --> 51:13.448
(chuckling): Do these look like
fishmonger hands to you, dear?

51:17.160 --> 51:20.914
Uh, given that your mother
and I go way back,

51:20.998 --> 51:23.876
I want you girls to know that...

51:26.503 --> 51:28.714
...if anything ever happened,

51:28.797 --> 51:31.842
you can come to me.

51:33.135 --> 51:36.138
I’ve seen it all,

51:36.221 --> 51:38.265
and I won’t judge.

51:49.902 --> 51:51.653
Connollys.

51:51.737 --> 51:53.822
-Oh, thank you.
-Thank you.

51:53.906 --> 51:56.283
Um, can we have a minute?

51:56.366 --> 51:58.118
Sure.

52:00.370 --> 52:02.206
PRISCILLA:
Enid said she and our mother

52:02.289 --> 52:04.374
made a lot of money together.

52:05.417 --> 52:07.878
What did she mean by that?

52:09.379 --> 52:11.173
What you girls
need to understand

52:11.256 --> 52:14.384
is that it used to be
real bad around here.

52:14.468 --> 52:18.555
It’s a small town,
but it’s also a port.

52:18.639 --> 52:20.432
A lot of men came through.

52:20.516 --> 52:22.476
Not all of them were nice.

52:22.559 --> 52:25.270
So, when Enid said
she wanted to start Oceanview,

52:25.354 --> 52:29.399
we all, including your mother,
supported her.

52:29.483 --> 52:31.985
By starting a whorehouse?

52:33.862 --> 52:37.074
By managing the situation.

52:38.492 --> 52:40.827
In those days, we said,
"Boys will be boys.

52:40.911 --> 52:43.830
If it’s not Enid’s girls,
then it’s our own daughters."

52:43.914 --> 52:45.791
We wanted something better
for you kids.

52:45.874 --> 52:47.334
GAIL:
Awful nerve of Enid,

52:47.417 --> 52:49.711
stirring things up with you two.

52:49.795 --> 52:52.965
Enid’s dangerous.
Stay away from her.

52:56.969 --> 52:59.763
(bird cawing)

53:03.350 --> 53:05.227
Ah, shit.

53:05.310 --> 53:06.645
I forgot we’re out of milk.

53:06.728 --> 53:07.855
I just bought some.

53:07.938 --> 53:10.607
No, it was bad.
I-I threw it out.

53:10.691 --> 53:12.901
What do you mean,
you threw it out?

53:12.985 --> 53:14.319
What, Pris?
It had lumps in it.

53:14.403 --> 53:15.404
-That’s gross.
-Where’s the carton?

53:15.487 --> 53:16.905
They can’t just sell us
bad milk, Mary Beth.

53:16.989 --> 53:18.365
I took it out
this morning, Priscilla.

53:18.448 --> 53:19.449
Goddamn it!

53:19.533 --> 53:20.576
I mean, we’re broke.

53:20.659 --> 53:22.160
Who does
this to their own daughters?

53:22.244 --> 53:23.787
I mean, this is so wrong.

53:23.871 --> 53:25.539
That-that we don’t have milk?

53:25.622 --> 53:28.584
That she ran a whorehouse.

53:30.169 --> 53:32.171
We did everything for her.

53:32.254 --> 53:34.173
Made sure she was comfortable,

53:34.256 --> 53:37.259
walked her around the house
with that fucking pillow,

53:37.342 --> 53:39.136
made her goddamn soup.

53:39.219 --> 53:42.055
Oh, took her to church
for her holiness.

53:42.139 --> 53:44.433
And how does she thank us, huh?

53:44.516 --> 53:46.185
She leaves us with no savings...

53:46.268 --> 53:47.477
-Pris.
-...a shitty business,

53:47.561 --> 53:49.605
funeral bills, hospital bills

53:49.688 --> 53:51.148
-and a house we can’t afford.
-Pris.

53:51.231 --> 53:52.941
What?

53:55.444 --> 53:58.322
(sighing)

54:02.993 --> 54:04.995
Someone’s gonna miss this.

54:07.748 --> 54:09.458
Yeah.

54:11.001 --> 54:12.920
But he’s dead.

54:18.091 --> 54:19.676
COLETTI:
Well, I think we found out

54:19.760 --> 54:21.637
who plowed into old Cap’n Dick.

54:22.971 --> 54:25.140
(coughs)

54:25.224 --> 54:27.267
-There’s guns in here.
-Okay. You sure about that?

54:27.351 --> 54:29.269
All right. Yeah, thanks.
All right, I got to run.

54:29.353 --> 54:32.564
I’ll bet you a Caramel
Frappuccino the bullet matches.

54:32.648 --> 54:34.942
Yeah, but why would he leave
the tarps in the trunk?

54:35.025 --> 54:36.860
And-and if you’re gonna
skip town,

54:36.944 --> 54:38.820
wouldn’t you take
the gun with you?

54:38.904 --> 54:40.197
Or y-you dump it off somewhere?

54:40.280 --> 54:42.366
Either way,
all roads lead to Gorski.

54:42.449 --> 54:45.827
Yeah, but Enid lied to us
about knowing his address.

54:45.911 --> 54:47.788
So says Declan.

54:47.871 --> 54:49.248
(chuckles)

54:49.331 --> 54:50.874
Hey, you know what?
I-I don’t understand--

54:50.958 --> 54:53.544
why are you always
giving her a free pass?

54:53.627 --> 54:55.170
Hey, Agatha Christie,

54:55.254 --> 54:58.882
how about you stop telling me
how to do my job, huh?

55:09.309 --> 55:11.311
(inhales deeply)

55:11.395 --> 55:13.188
(exhales)

55:26.493 --> 55:28.120
Come in.

55:29.162 --> 55:31.248
You can keep me company.

55:37.754 --> 55:39.798
Have some if you like.

55:44.428 --> 55:45.512
(grunts)

55:45.596 --> 55:48.307
-Ow, it’s hot.
-Blow on it first.

55:48.390 --> 55:50.184
(chuckles)

55:50.267 --> 55:52.352
(blowing)

55:55.814 --> 55:57.566
ALEXIS:
Mm.

56:05.324 --> 56:07.326
They’re saying bad things
about you.

56:09.494 --> 56:11.747
Who’s saying bad things?

56:13.040 --> 56:16.043
I don’t know. Some old ladies.

56:18.086 --> 56:20.005
What kind of bad things?

56:20.088 --> 56:22.049
That Dee...

56:23.675 --> 56:26.637
That, um...
that maybe you hurt Dee.

56:28.889 --> 56:31.141
And do you believe them?

56:32.601 --> 56:34.228
No.

56:34.311 --> 56:36.522
I mean, I don’t think so.
(chuckles)

56:38.440 --> 56:39.942
Let me ask you something.

56:40.025 --> 56:43.195
Who... who helped you out
when you had nothing?

56:43.278 --> 56:44.530
No, you did.

56:44.613 --> 56:46.156
No, I know, I know.

56:46.240 --> 56:48.825
-You did.
-(Enid sighs)

56:48.909 --> 56:51.161
I...

56:51.245 --> 56:53.914
I feel like such a fool.

56:55.374 --> 56:59.169
I had no idea
Gorski was such a monster.

56:59.253 --> 57:00.796
Wait.

57:00.879 --> 57:02.798
What... Gorski killed Dee?

57:02.881 --> 57:04.550
He’s a sick man.

57:04.633 --> 57:06.218
What can I say?

57:06.301 --> 57:07.761
I gave him a little bit
of authority,

57:07.845 --> 57:09.763
and he seemed to take it
as a free ticket

57:09.847 --> 57:11.974
to do what he wanted.

57:12.057 --> 57:13.851
Oh, my God.

57:13.934 --> 57:15.352
(gasps)

57:15.435 --> 57:17.646
But Dee, honey...

57:17.729 --> 57:21.859
she begged me to give her
the queen’s treatment.

57:23.652 --> 57:25.237
I’m sorry to break it to you,

57:25.320 --> 57:27.906
but that girl was ready
to sell you down the river

57:27.990 --> 57:30.242
at the drop of a hat
if it meant she could have

57:30.325 --> 57:32.244
-a bigger slice of pie.
-No, but Dee and I...

57:32.327 --> 57:34.079
-Dee and I were like sisters.
-(Enid bangs table)

57:34.162 --> 57:36.456
-Come on.
-Wake up, cupcake.

57:36.540 --> 57:40.377
She was only ever
looking out for herself.

57:40.460 --> 57:42.462
It was a sad realization
for me, too,

57:42.546 --> 57:44.339
after all I’d done for her.

57:44.423 --> 57:46.592
Enid, you fucking
owed her money.

57:46.675 --> 57:49.553
Dee was a selfish,
ungrateful junkie

57:49.636 --> 57:52.222
who was always skimming
off the top.

57:53.432 --> 57:55.684
Not an ounce of loyalty
in that girl.

57:58.937 --> 58:01.440
And you know what?

58:01.523 --> 58:04.151
I’m still here for you,
aren’t I?

58:07.863 --> 58:10.574
Come here.

58:10.657 --> 58:11.950
(floorboard creaks)

58:12.034 --> 58:12.910
Yeah.

58:23.462 --> 58:26.173
What are you
doing here, anyway?

58:26.256 --> 58:28.675
Why aren’t you at The Desert?

58:28.759 --> 58:30.385
Declan kicked us out.

58:30.469 --> 58:33.472
He said you didn’t pay
this month.

58:35.307 --> 58:37.476
(birds screeching)

58:39.561 --> 58:40.771
(loud bang on hood)

58:40.854 --> 58:43.232
Gail and Doreen
put you up to this?!

58:43.315 --> 58:45.901
Whoa, Enid, calm down.

58:45.984 --> 58:48.153
You’re not so pretty
when you’re mad.

58:48.237 --> 58:49.488
30 years of business,

58:49.571 --> 58:51.823
and I don’t get
the benefit of the doubt?!

58:51.907 --> 58:56.036
Just pay me what you owe me,
and your girls go back to work.

59:05.212 --> 59:07.256
(gasps, pants)

59:07.339 --> 59:08.924
You scared me.

59:10.676 --> 59:13.512
Your mom still hide whiskey
around here?

59:13.595 --> 59:15.430
Uh, I doubt it.

59:15.514 --> 59:18.892
Uh, is there something I could
help you with, Mrs. Devlin?

59:18.976 --> 59:21.603
Ms. Devlin.

59:21.687 --> 59:23.772
(grunts)

59:23.856 --> 59:26.108
-(bell jingles)
-Hi, Pris.

59:26.191 --> 59:28.485
Don’t hate me, but I splurged.

59:28.569 --> 59:29.778
ENID:
Bingo.

59:32.990 --> 59:35.284
Aged to perfection.

59:35.367 --> 59:36.577
(clicks tongue)

59:40.831 --> 59:44.793
ENID: I was about your age
when I inherited the B and B.

59:44.877 --> 59:47.796
When some fishermen started
bringing this girl

59:47.880 --> 59:50.799
to Oceanview
for hourly services,

59:50.883 --> 59:52.342
I was furious.

59:54.136 --> 59:58.515
But your mother had the idea
to actually talk to the girl.

59:58.599 --> 1:00:03.353
See if we could all find a way
to capitalize.

1:00:06.815 --> 1:00:08.650
And we did.

1:00:10.068 --> 1:00:11.904
Go on, drink up.

1:00:15.407 --> 1:00:16.950
Drink up.

1:00:27.961 --> 1:00:30.172
You know why I’m here?

1:00:32.925 --> 1:00:36.345
The sad truth is
I’m disappointed in you girls.

1:00:37.721 --> 1:00:39.932
You thought you could hustle me.

1:00:40.015 --> 1:00:41.850
Mrs. Devlin, we...

1:00:41.934 --> 1:00:44.686
-(Enid bangs table)
-But because of your mother,

1:00:44.770 --> 1:00:47.940
I’m giving you a second chance
to make this right.

1:00:51.652 --> 1:00:54.112
You’re going to bring me back
what you stole.

1:00:55.531 --> 1:00:58.200
And I’ll return...

1:00:58.283 --> 1:01:01.245
that fancy knife of yours.

1:01:07.626 --> 1:01:10.337
And if you don’t,
there are two things I can do.

1:01:11.797 --> 1:01:14.216
And the nice one
is to turn you in.

1:01:16.051 --> 1:01:18.303
See you tonight.

1:01:18.387 --> 1:01:19.721
MARY BETH:
Pris!

1:01:21.723 --> 1:01:25.269
Okay, Priscilla, just...
wait one minute.

1:01:26.311 --> 1:01:27.521
Priscilla, just slow down.

1:01:27.604 --> 1:01:29.273
How does she have the knife

1:01:29.356 --> 1:01:31.024
if you dropped it
off Kernwood Bridge?

1:01:31.108 --> 1:01:33.443
Well, you were freaking out.

1:01:33.527 --> 1:01:34.695
You lied to me.

1:01:34.778 --> 1:01:36.572
I needed to calm you down.

1:01:36.655 --> 1:01:38.448
-I’m going to the police.
-Look.

1:01:38.532 --> 1:01:40.576
Why don’t we just bring
that bitch back her money?

1:01:40.659 --> 1:01:43.579
You heard Gail.
She said stay the hell away.

1:01:43.662 --> 1:01:46.331
-That girl was killed.
-I know.

1:01:46.415 --> 1:01:49.293
-She worked for Enid, Mary Beth.
-I know, but-but...

1:01:49.376 --> 1:01:50.919
No, if you saw what I saw...

1:01:51.003 --> 1:01:52.462
Yeah, but that doesn’t
mean that...

1:01:52.546 --> 1:01:53.714
Where’s the money?

1:02:06.685 --> 1:02:08.562
I’m not a criminal.
(stammers)

1:02:08.645 --> 1:02:10.022
I can’t live like this.

1:02:10.105 --> 1:02:13.442
So then let’s just leave.

1:02:13.525 --> 1:02:15.777
We could take this money.
It’s $50,000.

1:02:15.861 --> 1:02:18.614
We could get out
of this dump, Pris.

1:02:18.697 --> 1:02:21.491
This town, this house--
it’s all pathetic.

1:02:21.575 --> 1:02:23.952
If you leave with that money,
I’m done.

1:02:24.036 --> 1:02:25.621
I mean, really,
you’re on your own.

1:02:25.704 --> 1:02:27.206
No one to clean up your mess.

1:02:27.289 --> 1:02:30.042
Do you get that if we-we go
and we turn ourselves in,

1:02:30.125 --> 1:02:31.919
then-then our lives are over?

1:02:32.002 --> 1:02:35.756

Well, better than "sir."
I’ll take it.

1:05:34.560 --> 1:05:35.686
Wow.

1:05:35.769 --> 1:05:37.437
Smells delish in there.
Is that haddock?

Geez. Smells good.

Do you want to join us?

Uh, yeah.

Sorry. The reason I ask is, uh,

1:06:45.797 --> 1:06:48.675
the station actually got a call
from this residence,

1:06:48.759 --> 1:06:51.595
um, pretty late
on Saturday night, so...

1:06:51.678 --> 1:06:53.847

anything unusual?

1:06:56.058 --> 1:06:57.518
Oh. (chuckles)

You know, that was me.

1:07:04.691 --> 1:07:07.277
Oh, um...

1:07:07.361 --> 1:07:10.239
our Uncle Henry got
really drunk,

1:07:10.322 --> 1:07:11.782
and, uh... (chuckles)

1:07:11.865 --> 1:07:14.826
I just was trying to call
to see if he got home okay,

1:07:14.910 --> 1:07:17.162

to press the, uh,

a new girlfriend that night.

1:16:07.651 --> 1:16:08.986
We swear.

1:16:09.069 --> 1:16:10.612
WOMAN (over TV):
And I was like, "My mom’s here.

1:16:10.696 --> 1:16:12.030
She can go get your ticket..."

1:16:16.410 --> 1:16:18.954
(whispers):
God, I miss your mother.

1:16:22.499 --> 1:16:24.960
I never said goodbye.

1:16:26.503 --> 1:16:28.589
I’m sure she hated me.

1:16:29.882 --> 1:16:31.550
She wasn’t angry.

1:16:34.011 --> 1:16:35.929
I think she understood.

1:16:37.973 --> 1:16:40.934
(chuckling):
She was a good egg, your mother.

1:16:42.853 --> 1:16:44.897
Did everything for you girls.

1:16:46.523 --> 1:16:48.692
Left the business
’cause of you.

1:16:50.527 --> 1:16:53.113
I don’t hold it
against you, though.

1:16:54.865 --> 1:16:58.118
MARY BETH: Well, we won’t be
bothering you from now on.

1:17:00.037 --> 1:17:02.748
Tell that to Gorski.

1:17:10.839 --> 1:17:12.674
(snoring)

1:17:21.016 --> 1:17:23.435
We’d like our knife back.

1:17:23.519 --> 1:17:26.188
Hmm?

1:17:26.271 --> 1:17:28.023
Oh, yeah.

1:17:29.733 --> 1:17:31.443
The knife.

1:17:35.948 --> 1:17:37.699
(sighs)

1:17:45.415 --> 1:17:47.751
(drops knife, closes drawer)

1:17:47.835 --> 1:17:49.795
On second thought,

1:17:49.878 --> 1:17:53.715
I think you should keep
some of this money.

1:17:56.844 --> 1:17:58.762
I know you need it.

1:18:02.641 --> 1:18:06.061
Buy a f-few nice things.

1:18:06.144 --> 1:18:07.855
Wouldn’t hurt.

1:18:09.064 --> 1:18:11.024
And when that money’s gone,

1:18:11.108 --> 1:18:13.485
you can come to work for me.

1:18:14.403 --> 1:18:17.322
On the business side, of course.

1:18:20.951 --> 1:18:22.870
We can’t accept this.

1:18:22.953 --> 1:18:25.038
Don’t be stupid.

1:18:27.040 --> 1:18:29.877
Pris is right.

1:18:29.960 --> 1:18:31.253
We don’t want your money.

1:18:31.336 --> 1:18:33.046
-(smack)
-(gasps)

1:18:33.130 --> 1:18:34.464
I don’t like your tone.

1:18:36.216 --> 1:18:39.970
You brats have no idea
how easy you have it.

1:18:41.138 --> 1:18:42.681
We were on our own.

1:18:42.764 --> 1:18:45.017
No one was looking out for us.

1:18:45.100 --> 1:18:48.437
But you girls, you grew up
spoiled fucking rotten!

1:18:48.520 --> 1:18:52.399
And now you want to act
all high and mighty?

1:18:52.482 --> 1:18:54.610
Look down on me? Judge me?

1:18:54.693 --> 1:18:56.069
Judge my life?

1:18:56.153 --> 1:18:58.280
-Mrs. Devlin...
-Ms. Devlin!

1:18:58.363 --> 1:19:00.908
You should be on your knees
thanking me!

1:19:00.991 --> 1:19:04.620
-(groaning)
-(Priscilla gasps)

1:19:09.917 --> 1:19:12.085
(Enid sobbing quietly)

1:19:14.713 --> 1:19:16.715
-(exhales sharply)
-Here.

1:19:18.175 --> 1:19:19.343
(quietly):
Yeah.

1:19:19.426 --> 1:19:21.845
I can’t. Stop it.

1:19:28.101 --> 1:19:31.313
(sighing)

1:19:37.444 --> 1:19:40.447
We’re taking our knife back,
Ms. Devlin.

JUSTIN: Nan, what do you, uh...
what do you know

1:23:03.525 --> 1:23:05.694
about the Connolly sisters?
You knew their mother, right?

1:23:05.777 --> 1:23:07.988
Real nice girls.

1:23:08.071 --> 1:23:09.364
Sure about that?

1:23:09.448 --> 1:23:12.034
Yeah, Mary Margaret and I
go way back.

1:23:12.117 --> 1:23:14.161
Well, they’re acting strange.

1:23:14.244 --> 1:23:15.579
(Susie laughs)

1:23:15.662 --> 1:23:16.914
Oh, honey.

1:23:19.416 --> 1:23:21.960
I think someone has a crush.

1:23:22.044 --> 1:23:23.378
(Justin chuckles)

1:23:23.462 --> 1:23:26.423
Have you seen how cute
you look in your uniform?

1:23:26.507 --> 1:23:30.010
-Okay. Sure, Nan.
-(Susie laughing)

1:23:30.093 --> 1:23:32.304
I’m proud of you, Justy.

1:23:32.387 --> 1:23:34.473
-Working so hard.
-Mm.

1:23:34.556 --> 1:23:37.059
Well, and Coletti’s
a great teacher.

1:23:37.142 --> 1:23:40.229
(chuckles)
That guy confounds me.

1:23:40.312 --> 1:23:42.981
Just overnight,
out of the blue,

1:23:43.065 --> 1:23:45.067
pulls a 180
on this murder case.

1:23:45.150 --> 1:23:47.528
Murder?
I thought she drowned.

1:23:47.611 --> 1:23:49.863
And he’s demanding
that I go with him

1:23:49.947 --> 1:23:51.949
to make an arrest
at the crack of dawn.

1:23:52.032 --> 1:23:53.742
I don’t know.

1:23:53.825 --> 1:23:56.912
Whoever changed his mind
must be pretty convincing, Nan.

1:23:56.995 --> 1:24:00.040
Yeah, I’ll bet he’s got
reliable sources.

1:24:10.175 --> 1:24:13.679
Still dredging the bay
for Gorski’s body, right?

1:24:13.762 --> 1:24:16.014
After we bust the Oceanview?

1:24:16.098 --> 1:24:17.975
What’s the point?

1:24:22.521 --> 1:24:24.064
Mm.

1:24:25.482 --> 1:24:27.317
Hey, there’s your girl.

1:24:27.401 --> 1:24:28.902
Let’s do a drive-by.

1:24:30.571 --> 1:24:31.905

Nah.

MARY BETH: I guess now it’s time
we got to get back to work.

1:24:44.668 --> 1:24:47.588
Pris, I figure,
if we bust our asses,

1:24:47.671 --> 1:24:49.965
we could probably
keep the house.

1:24:52.509 --> 1:24:54.595
The house is just a house.

1:24:56.138 --> 1:24:58.932
We got to get you
to college next fall.

1:25:02.644 --> 1:25:04.479
What about you?

1:25:04.563 --> 1:25:06.899
I like it here.
(chuckles)

1:25:06.982 --> 1:25:09.109
I’ll come visit you, though.
