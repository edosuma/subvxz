00:34.826 --> 00:36.369
Anna, I apologized.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.290
I want a reason.
Visiting hour's almost over.

00:44.961 --> 00:48.506
Getting here has been
difficult for me with the baby.

00:48.590 --> 00:49.424
Hmm.

00:52.260 --> 00:55.096
Were you sad
when you lost your job at Bloomberg?

00:56.473 --> 00:58.558
Who was he anyway,
the kid who tricked you?

00:58.641 --> 01:01.269
Why don't we talk about your business?
The Anna Delvey Fund--

01:01.352 --> 01:03.354
Foundation. The Anna Delvey Foundation.

01:03.438 --> 01:04.856
Foundation, right.

01:06.232 --> 01:08.401
Where did your idea
for the foundation come from?

01:09.736 --> 01:11.780
Did Chase help you come up with it?

01:11.863 --> 01:13.448
Why would Chase have helped me?

01:13.531 --> 01:15.075
He was your boyfriend.

01:15.158 --> 01:17.368
No. He was a guy I was screwing.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.412
You want a romance novel, go buy one.

01:19.496 --> 01:22.665
Well, you two were working
on your businesses together.

01:22.749 --> 01:25.460
We were building our businesses
separately, at the same time,

01:25.543 --> 01:28.088
parallel to one another, not together.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.172
Okay.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.802
But you spent two years together?

01:34.928 --> 01:35.762
Mm…

01:36.513 --> 01:38.473
Do you feel like
you got something from him?

01:38.556 --> 01:40.183
Not done your homework on me?

01:40.266 --> 01:44.145
I'm fluent in English,
French, German, Mandarin, Spanish.

01:44.229 --> 01:47.107
I speak seven languages,
I have a photographic memory,

01:47.190 --> 01:49.567
I'm a mathematical genius…

01:49.651 --> 01:51.236
…and I have a talent for business.

01:51.319 --> 01:53.613
ADF was my idea. All mine.

01:53.696 --> 01:55.657
I'm fucking gifted. Brilliant.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.284
Does that answer your question?

01:58.368 --> 01:59.202
Chase?

02:02.580 --> 02:07.252
Being pregnant
is a shit excuse not to come see me.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.420
You're not special.

02:10.171 --> 02:13.383
People have babies every day,
they squat in fields.

02:13.466 --> 02:14.884
I'm in prison.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.096
You get here or we're done.

02:21.599 --> 02:25.812
Oh. Next time you come,
bring me some underwear.

02:25.895 --> 02:28.565
Nothing cheaper than Natori, Bergdorf's.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.900
The panties here are disgusting.

02:56.384 --> 02:59.095
Is this where the crib goes?
Right under the window?

02:59.179 --> 03:00.513
I don't know.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.599
You know how insane Anna is.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.475
She won't give me anything,

03:04.559 --> 03:07.729
which is no help with the
"Paul breathing down my neck" situation.

03:07.812 --> 03:10.899
But maybe the changing table
could go by the window,

03:10.982 --> 03:12.984
so we could look outside
when we're changing her.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.195
It's not like I'm hardballing her.

03:15.278 --> 03:18.239
I thought I was starting soft, easy.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.283
So maybe the crib goes over there.

03:21.993 --> 03:24.287
You can't put the crib here.
This is my wall.

03:24.370 --> 03:28.416
And will your wall still be here
by the time the baby comes?

03:29.292 --> 03:32.128
Jack. I don't know.

03:32.754 --> 03:33.755
For now…

03:35.006 --> 03:37.133
The wall stays.
I need the wall to stay. Okay?

03:39.135 --> 03:40.220
Crib stays here.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.222
Gotcha.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.474
Back to work.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.560
"Tell me about your business,
tell me about your boyfriend."

03:47.644 --> 03:50.271
"Where is he now?" Soft, easy.

03:51.689 --> 03:55.151
Unless, their two-year relationship

03:55.235 --> 03:58.238
was just a front
for their various schemes.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.144
I spoke to you once already.
Wasn't that enough?

04:30.228 --> 04:31.688
I've a few more questions.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.147
Well, it's Vivian right?

04:33.982 --> 04:37.318
Vivian, we both know
I can't be associated with this story.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.697
I mean, you see,
the work I do is important to me,

04:40.780 --> 04:43.700
and more importantly,
it's important to the lesser privileged.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.243
They need me.

04:45.326 --> 04:47.578
If I am to be connected
with your article in any way…

04:47.662 --> 04:51.165
I am on the board
of seven philanthropic organizations.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.376
No one raises like me.

04:53.459 --> 04:57.046
I can't have this kind of distraction
when my work is so very--

04:57.130 --> 04:58.506
Important. Right.

04:59.382 --> 05:03.678
The thing is, I know Chase and Anna
lived with you while they were together,

05:03.761 --> 05:05.805
you're listed
as an advisor for Chase's app.

05:05.888 --> 05:09.434
And, as you know,
you're tagged in photographs with Anna,

05:09.517 --> 05:12.729
so I can leave here
and go digging all over the Internet

05:12.812 --> 05:15.523
and report the cold, sordid facts
from the public information,

05:15.606 --> 05:17.358
which includes your name,

05:17.442 --> 05:19.986
or I can stay, we can chat,

05:20.987 --> 05:23.698
and your identity
will remain very well shielded

05:23.781 --> 05:25.992
while we shed some perspective
on Chase and Anna.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.376
I want to be off-the-record.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.711
I'll put you on background.

05:37.462 --> 05:38.755
Without using my name.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.757
That's what background is.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.176
And no recording devices.

05:43.259 --> 05:45.595
I'll delete our interview
as soon as I finish the article.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.014
No recording devices. You can take notes.

05:49.932 --> 05:50.767
Sold.

05:54.312 --> 05:58.941
Chase and Anna stayed with me
for several months in 2014.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.779
He had put all his money into his start-up

06:02.862 --> 06:06.741
and she claimed not to want
to take Daddy's money anymore,

06:06.824 --> 06:09.118
that she was making a go
of living on her own.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.121
Can you tell me
what their relationship was like?

06:12.205 --> 06:13.790
No, certainly not.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.083
Let me be clear.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.294
Anyone can lie and say I was an advisor.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.213
I had very little to do
with either of them.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.340
They were Val's friends…

06:23.174 --> 06:25.718
…and I saw through that girl immediately.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.095
She was a name-dropper.

06:28.137 --> 06:32.266
Thought she knew better than anyone else,
when she didn't even get up before noon.

06:33.309 --> 06:34.185
What about Chase?

06:37.313 --> 06:38.439
I didn't like him either.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.631
Oh, for fuck's sake.

07:03.714 --> 07:06.134
-Thank God.
-Hey, Nora.

07:08.803 --> 07:09.804
Oh.

07:09.887 --> 07:11.139
How was Fashion Week?

07:13.141 --> 07:14.934
Did you see the Chanel show?

07:15.017 --> 07:17.145
-Where's Val?
-Haven't you heard from him?

07:17.228 --> 07:18.229
No, nothing.

07:18.312 --> 07:19.230
Oh.

07:19.313 --> 07:22.358
He said he was going home
to Alabama to visit his dad.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.194
Alabama? Should I be worried?

07:25.278 --> 07:27.488
No. No, you know how he gets.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.241
-Work hard, play hard, dry out, repeat.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.619
Well, I'm so pleased to have you back.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.329
I'm pleased to be back.

07:35.413 --> 07:36.747
Oh.

07:36.831 --> 07:41.544
So, tomorrow night I'm hosting
a little dinner at Kleinsmith's.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.259
She's kind of an old bitch.

07:48.342 --> 07:50.470
-Shh. She'll hear you.

07:51.512 --> 07:54.056
Hey, you just don't like her
'cause she likes me so much.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.809
No, I like an old bitch.

07:56.893 --> 08:01.230
It's you who's embarrassing,
the ass-kissing tech guy.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.774
I have to kiss her ass for Wake.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.069
And tomorrow,
you'll be kissing plenty of ass

08:07.153 --> 08:09.113
for the Anna Delvey Foundation,

08:09.197 --> 08:11.324
-so pucker up.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.997
How many people are we meeting with?

08:18.706 --> 08:19.540
Three.

08:22.877 --> 08:26.672
Don't you think I'll need
more than three people on my team

08:26.756 --> 08:28.674
before we go to financiers?

08:30.259 --> 08:33.346
We'll need hospitality people,

08:33.429 --> 08:37.975
PR, designers for the space.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.936
Are we talking work now?

08:41.604 --> 08:42.897
You're the one who started it.

08:43.940 --> 08:44.941
You don't like it?

08:45.775 --> 08:46.776
Oh, I love it.

09:00.748 --> 09:03.543
Greer's been begging me
to put him on the list.

09:03.626 --> 09:06.420
So I'll invite him and mention the app.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.965
Well, if he could do half a million.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.841
Mmm.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.095
-Good morning.

09:14.178 --> 09:17.265
Can you imagine
if everyone slept as late as Anna?

09:17.348 --> 09:19.058
Wake would have double the data.

09:22.186 --> 09:23.563
Are you ready?

09:23.646 --> 09:26.190
Yeah. Is that what you're wearing?

09:31.612 --> 09:34.532
You should study these bios
before you get going.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.450
Make it clear you've done your homework.

09:50.172 --> 09:51.007
Okay.

09:51.924 --> 09:52.758
I read them.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.094
You can't be done that fast.

09:55.177 --> 09:56.929
I have an eidetic memory. Quiz me.

09:58.180 --> 09:59.015
Okay.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.184
First meeting?

10:02.268 --> 10:06.063
Gabriel Calatrava,
lead architect at Calatrava Grace.

10:06.147 --> 10:10.234
I want the Anna Delvey Foundation
to be a space for the wealthy.

10:10.318 --> 10:15.281
A refuge from the outside world
for artists and patrons of the Arts.

10:15.364 --> 10:21.203
It will be global, exclusive
and the interiors should reflect that.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.123
I can't imagine anyone else designing it.

10:24.206 --> 10:25.333
I… I'm intrigued.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.793
Um, but with a space so focused on art,

10:27.877 --> 10:30.046
I'd love to see
the collection you're thinking about

10:30.129 --> 10:32.381
before I decide
if I want to take on the project.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.426
Why don't you
start with a curator or gallerist,

10:35.509 --> 10:38.095
and, um, if they say yes,

10:38.888 --> 10:40.598
-I'm in.

10:40.681 --> 10:41.766
And next?

10:41.849 --> 10:45.978
Sasha Thomas, founder and lead gallerist
at Thomas & Fortman.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.564
The club will be intimate, private,

10:48.648 --> 10:51.317
with spaces for food,
co-working, hotel rooms.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.944
But the art will be the centerpiece,

10:54.028 --> 10:57.114
which is why I would love
to partner with someone like you,

10:57.198 --> 10:59.075
with such an impeccable collection.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.910
And it sounds lovely.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.204
No, absolutely divine.

11:03.871 --> 11:07.083
But you know, um,
I can't really design a collection

11:07.166 --> 11:09.752
until I know
the overall feel of the space.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.505
You mentioned you met with an architect.

11:12.588 --> 11:16.967
Why don't you see if he's on board first,
and then circle back with me?

11:18.636 --> 11:19.720
And finally?

11:19.804 --> 11:23.474
Richard Lavin, manages all of
Manhattan's highest-end properties.

11:23.557 --> 11:26.143
We thought we would
start with the building first,

11:26.227 --> 11:29.772
before we go to a curator
or an architect, for example,

11:29.855 --> 11:32.233
and we know you represent
all the best buildings.

11:32.316 --> 11:34.193
Right. But who is "we"?

11:34.902 --> 11:39.407
Do you have investors,
or creative team, or anyone on board?

11:39.490 --> 11:41.659
To be honest, I love the idea.

11:42.576 --> 11:44.995
My hesitation isn't about the project…

11:45.079 --> 11:46.580
It's that these sorts of businesses

11:46.664 --> 11:49.709
rely so heavily
on the visibility of their founders and…

11:49.792 --> 11:53.713
I choose who I work with
based on people even more than ideas.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.798
And when it comes down to it…

11:55.881 --> 11:59.760
Who the fuck is Anna Delvey, and why
should I care about her?

11:59.844 --> 12:02.763
No offense, hmm? But you know what I mean.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.146
I'm sure you did a great job pitching.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.898
I know it's not the result
you were hoping for, but…

12:12.982 --> 12:16.694
We need better people.
They're all so small-minded.

12:16.777 --> 12:18.404
We need to set up more meetings.

12:18.487 --> 12:21.323
I called in all my favors
to get those meetings.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.366
This takes time.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.368
You only have three favors?

12:24.452 --> 12:27.037
Maybe we'll meet someone
at the party tonight.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.873
There you are.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.459
Givenchy.

12:31.542 --> 12:34.545
You can't keep running around
looking like a man of the people anymore.

12:34.628 --> 12:35.713
Thanks, Nora.

12:36.464 --> 12:37.715
Where are you headed out to?

12:38.424 --> 12:41.677
Oh, is it okay if Anna comes along too?
It's your event, right?

12:41.761 --> 12:42.720
Oh, bunny.

12:42.803 --> 12:47.308
Well, I'd love to bring you both, but no.
Hurry now, we don't want to be late.

12:50.436 --> 12:53.147
I'm sorry.
I need to get this investment tonight.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.025
I don't care. Go to your party.

12:59.236 --> 13:00.404
-Hmm.

13:22.510 --> 13:23.511
Sorry.

13:24.220 --> 13:27.056
I'm awake. How was your night?

13:27.139 --> 13:28.349
-Really good.
-Hmm.

13:28.933 --> 13:32.937
Greer wants to invest a million.
Everyone is so amped for the beta.

13:33.771 --> 13:34.730
How was your night?

13:35.981 --> 13:37.274
I need Nora.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.151
What?

13:39.235 --> 13:41.570
I need Nora for ADF.

13:42.613 --> 13:45.741
Nora is not really someone
you need on your team.

13:46.367 --> 13:50.996
She's more of an advisor,
makes intros, lends her stamp of approval.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.122
Exactly.

13:52.206 --> 13:56.794
No one will take me seriously in business
until some rich person signs off on me.

13:56.877 --> 14:00.548
So to get people to join my team,
I need Nora first.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.092
Sure, yeah. Someone like her.

14:04.093 --> 14:04.927
Why not her?

14:06.345 --> 14:07.429
Nora is tough.

14:08.389 --> 14:12.518
And she told me her passion is really
in supporting minority entrepreneurs.

14:12.601 --> 14:14.436
I'm a woman.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.729
That's not a minority.

14:15.813 --> 14:18.482
You're an Asian man in tech.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.025
I'm the child of immigrants.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.612
Is it because
you don't want to share Nora?

14:23.696 --> 14:24.697
No.

14:26.198 --> 14:31.579
It's just she doesn't
seem to like you that much, you know.

14:31.662 --> 14:32.830
So help me.

14:33.455 --> 14:34.874
We'll find you someone.

14:35.916 --> 14:36.750
Soon.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.210
Okay?

14:39.753 --> 14:40.588
Yeah.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.850
I mean, Chase never took her seriously.

14:52.933 --> 14:54.727
Why do you think Anna was with him?

14:54.810 --> 14:59.648
I think she thought that he would
introduce her to the right people.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.068
Thankfully, he was smart enough not to.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.780
And why was he with her?

15:07.990 --> 15:10.242
Do you think they were really in love?

15:10.326 --> 15:13.746
Oh, I really don't care to put myself
in the mind of a 30-something man.

15:14.788 --> 15:17.166
Do you know where he is now, Chase?

15:17.249 --> 15:18.918
I have no idea.

15:43.817 --> 15:45.069
-You're up early.

15:45.152 --> 15:46.153
Morning.

15:46.236 --> 15:47.279
Where's Chase?

15:47.363 --> 15:49.907
He's at work building his app, finally.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.742
-Hmm.
-I was just admiring this piece.

15:52.242 --> 15:53.285
My Polay.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.996
I bought it at an auction in '97.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.790
-Hmm. '97?
-Mm.

15:59.166 --> 16:02.920
That's before Polay was even in New York.
Her Omaha days.

16:03.504 --> 16:04.964
-You're a fan?

16:05.047 --> 16:06.423
Of her early work, yes.

16:06.507 --> 16:10.386
But her new phase?
The giant warehouse sculptures?

16:11.011 --> 16:12.513
You know what they say,

16:12.596 --> 16:16.016
"When you're out of new ideas,
make your old ideas bigger."

16:20.312 --> 16:24.817
Well, I'm headed off to Bergdorf's.
Want to tag along?

16:47.464 --> 16:52.469
Oh, it's a shame to make home décor
with such a beautiful creature, isn't it?

16:52.553 --> 16:53.387
Donna, don't start.

16:54.888 --> 16:56.515
I can't stop.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.518


17:01.478 --> 17:04.481
My grandson cries for ten minutes,

17:04.565 --> 17:06.442
and suddenly,
I'm on the board for a charity

17:06.525 --> 17:09.695
trying to stop
the taxidermy of exotic fucking birds.

17:10.738 --> 17:13.449
Miss Radford, Miss Zaveri, this way.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.533
Sure.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.202
-You're obsessed.

17:17.953 --> 17:19.955
Here she is. Beautiful.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.082
-Thank you.
-Hello.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.042
Darling.

17:24.918 --> 17:27.212
-

17:31.133 --> 17:32.092
Good to see you.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.177
-Hello.
-Look at this.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.056
-

17:39.308 --> 17:41.185
Now, what is going on?
When is the show?

17:41.268 --> 17:42.311
Glamour queen.

17:45.939 --> 17:46.815
Oh.

17:48.025 --> 17:48.984
You look lovely.

17:49.651 --> 17:51.320
Susan, how are the new offices?

17:51.403 --> 17:53.113
They're getting there.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.282
Our decorator
just landed a set of Kandinskys.

17:55.365 --> 17:57.284
-I heard that auction went insane.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.912
-Oh.
-You hear 281 Park is up for lease?

17:59.995 --> 18:02.790
-No.
-The old Church Missions House?

18:03.499 --> 18:05.959
Stunning. Someone should
take those offices.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.545
Oh. Can you imagine
the art you could hang in there?

18:08.629 --> 18:09.463
God.

18:09.546 --> 18:13.217
Miss Prada sent the Saffiano leathers
for you ladies to design your own bags.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.802
Would you like to pick a leather?

18:16.011 --> 18:17.304
Please thank Miuccia.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.473
Were some coats pulled for my rack?

18:23.352 --> 18:24.269
Thank you, sweetheart.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.229
Thank you.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.980
-Oh, great.

18:27.648 --> 18:28.482
Oh.

18:28.565 --> 18:31.026
-Oscar for winter.
-Hmm. Fall.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.488
Uh… How do you all know each other?

18:35.072 --> 18:38.951
Oh, we came up together
in the days of the old boys' club.

18:39.576 --> 18:41.995
So we decided to make our own girls' club.

18:42.913 --> 18:45.541
It can be so isolating
being a woman in business.

18:45.624 --> 18:46.583
Indeed.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.709
Uh…

18:48.210 --> 18:50.546
It still feels
like a boys' club, even now.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.256
As I've been building ADF--

18:52.339 --> 18:53.549
-Building what?
-Uh…

18:54.091 --> 18:56.802
I'm building a social club,
the Anna Delvey Foundation.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.430
-Good for you.

19:00.514 --> 19:03.725
Oh, Donna's assistant knows this store
like the back of her hand.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.728
Why don't you go with the girls
to pick some things out for Chase?

19:07.855 --> 19:08.689
Chase?

19:08.772 --> 19:11.483
He can't keep taking meetings
in those hideous scrubs.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.277
Something with a button wouldn't hurt.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.074
She yelled at me, four minutes straight

19:19.158 --> 19:22.327
for letting the barista put my name
on her coffee cup, instead of hers.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.913
She said it makes her feel
like she's drinking <i>my</i> coffee.

19:28.709 --> 19:32.296
Miss Radford left for the day,
but said you'd be adding some things.

19:32.379 --> 19:33.839
Will you be signing for her account?

19:33.922 --> 19:34.756
Hmm.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.435
I want the Foundation at 281 Park.

19:46.518 --> 19:47.436
That's great.

19:47.519 --> 19:50.939
It's the old Church Missions House.
It's the perfect setting.

19:51.023 --> 19:55.736
All marble, and stone,
and medieval architecture, it's--

19:55.819 --> 19:56.862
Yeah.

19:59.114 --> 20:00.282
Are you even listening?

20:01.033 --> 20:01.867
Yeah.

20:02.743 --> 20:06.538
No. Yeah, I am.
It's just I've got to go to Berlin.

20:07.247 --> 20:08.081
Why?

20:08.874 --> 20:12.211
Work. I got invited
to do a talk in Open Air.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.130
I thought you were building the beta.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.216
Yeah, I am. It's just…

20:17.299 --> 20:21.220
It's going well,
so I want to build some buzz again.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.888
Then I'm coming with you.

20:22.971 --> 20:25.307
I'm starting to feel trapped
in this fucking house.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.060
And actually, the Berlin Biennale
is on right now.

20:28.143 --> 20:30.020
I really just need to focus on work.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.105
-It's going to be a quick trip.

20:32.189 --> 20:35.400
Then you can't go right now.
You're supposed to be helping with ADF.

20:35.984 --> 20:38.820
Hey, ADF will come together
when it's ready.

20:39.947 --> 20:44.910
Look, you don't know this yet,
but there's a sense of meant to be,

20:44.993 --> 20:48.121
of kismet,
with the way companies coalesce.

20:49.122 --> 20:49.957
Trust me.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.252
I'm not leaving my company
up to the stars.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.962
Look, I'm taking care of us.

20:55.045 --> 20:57.381
If you need a loan or something…

20:59.132 --> 21:01.969
If I wanted money, I'd ask my dad.

21:02.052 --> 21:05.305
What I need is something that's my own.

21:05.389 --> 21:06.682
And you'll have it.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.686
I'll be back in a couple days,
a week, tops.

21:25.784 --> 21:31.290
In 2015, Silicon Valley invests
$3 million in Chase's app.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.250
He was the hottest thing
on Sand Hill Road.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.919
Then, eight months later he goes dark.

21:36.003 --> 21:38.630
Stops posting completely,
stops updating his Kickstarter.

21:38.714 --> 21:41.091
He won't answer my emails.
It's like he disappeared.

21:41.174 --> 21:43.510
Probably got lost up his own ass.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.391
-What's going on?
-What do you want?

21:50.309 --> 21:52.728
Well, it's just this compulsive networker,

21:52.811 --> 21:57.357
this hyper online,
entrepreneurial extrovert just vanishes.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.277
It's not normal. It's a mystery.

22:00.861 --> 22:04.156
If you let me look through
the discovery from the year they dated--

22:04.239 --> 22:05.615
No.

22:14.916 --> 22:15.917
Why aren't you answering?

22:16.001 --> 22:20.297
Because Anna calls me
37 times a day, wanting things.

22:20.380 --> 22:23.925
I can't make those things happen until
I've finished cataloging this discovery.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.262
So let me help you, please?

22:27.929 --> 22:32.392
Anna's not a mystery to me.
She's a job. So, if you don't mind.

23:04.674 --> 23:05.926
Oh, hi.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.220
How are you?

23:18.271 --> 23:20.524
Not the best after-party
the theater's thrown.

23:20.607 --> 23:23.485
I mean, kicking everybody out
at midnight? Seriously.

23:23.568 --> 23:25.737
Well, here's to the after, after-party.

23:26.780 --> 23:28.156
What happened Tuesday?

23:28.240 --> 23:31.118
I don't know. It was fine.
It was a meeting with the producers.

23:33.203 --> 23:34.454
That's for you.

24:00.730 --> 24:04.192
Oh, Anna, we're all ordering some
take-out. Do you want anything?

24:04.276 --> 24:05.277
Oh.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.445
I could eat.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.698
Great. Right down the street.
It'll be ready in 20.

24:11.408 --> 24:12.242
Oh.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.583
-No, I never go there in the off-season.

24:19.666 --> 24:22.127
I don't know why anyone ever would.
Who knows…

24:22.210 --> 24:23.295
Oh, oh, oh.

24:23.837 --> 24:25.839
-Thank you so much, Anna.

24:25.922 --> 24:26.840
You're welcome.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.717
Do you know where Chase is these days?

24:28.800 --> 24:30.802
I was talking about his app
to a friend of mine

24:30.886 --> 24:33.346
who I think
is very interested in investing.

24:33.430 --> 24:36.224
Oh. He's not here.
He's at Open Air in Berlin.

24:37.184 --> 24:40.729
Mmm, I don't think so.
Open Air was cancelled this year.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.189
Hmm.

25:07.380 --> 25:09.716
<i>Hey.</i>
<i>Sorry, my service is weird here.</i>

25:09.799 --> 25:10.634
Yeah?

25:11.259 --> 25:12.135
How's Berlin?

25:12.719 --> 25:14.846
Good. Yeah, it's going really well.

25:14.930 --> 25:16.890
Uh, are you at Open Air right now?

25:16.973 --> 25:18.725
<i>Yeah, it's awesome.</i>

25:18.808 --> 25:21.770
I'm meeting so many people
I want to introduce you to.

25:21.853 --> 25:24.731
Chase, Open Air
was fucking cancelled this year.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.066
Where the fuck are you?

25:29.486 --> 25:30.320
Hello?

25:34.491 --> 25:35.909
<i>This is Chase.</i>

25:35.992 --> 25:39.162
Chase, you better fucking call me back.
Where the fuck are you?

25:39.246 --> 25:41.206
Just be direct with me.

25:41.289 --> 25:44.751
I don't know why you lied to me,
but I'm sure there's an explanation

25:44.834 --> 25:47.712
and I'm giving you
a chance to explain. Okay?

25:47.796 --> 25:51.132
Five fucking fake
Instagram posts from Berlin?

25:51.216 --> 25:53.969
Are you serious? Oh, my God.

25:54.052 --> 25:56.513
You're such a fucking psycho!

25:56.596 --> 25:58.765
Or am I the psycho for believing you?

25:58.848 --> 26:01.560
-<i>This is Chase.</i>

26:01.643 --> 26:05.480
This is seriously so fucked up.

26:05.564 --> 26:11.027
And you're supposed to be helping me,
and you leave me all on my own.

26:11.111 --> 26:12.988
And now you're lying to me.

26:16.866 --> 26:18.827
Please, can you call me back?

26:19.411 --> 26:21.705
-<i>This is Chase.</i>

26:21.788 --> 26:26.167
Okay, I'm not going
to leave you any more messages.

26:26.251 --> 26:30.130
I'm just…
I'm not going to be able to sleep,

26:31.631 --> 26:34.801
so I'm going to take some pills.

26:35.927 --> 26:37.554
I've been drinking though,

26:38.555 --> 26:40.473
if you don't hear from me.

26:41.266 --> 26:44.311
Anyway, bye.

27:18.637 --> 27:19.471
Raphael?

27:21.598 --> 27:22.515
Hey, Anna.

27:22.599 --> 27:24.392
What's happened to your offices?

27:26.227 --> 27:27.062
Um…

27:28.146 --> 27:31.524
Chase hired me to build the app,
but I deal in wireframes not back-end.

27:32.317 --> 27:33.276
I'm a designer.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.279
The functionality Chase wanted,
he needed a computer programmer.

27:36.363 --> 27:39.115
Even though it's his company,
he never cared how it worked.

27:39.199 --> 27:42.077
He just wanted it to look cool.
And then he stopped paying us.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.453
And he hid all that from Anna?

27:44.037 --> 27:45.121
Oh, yeah.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.333
Um, you should really talk to Chase.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.168
I don't know where he is.

27:50.251 --> 27:51.920
I'm sorry. I don't know.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.506
If you see him,
could you ask him to pay me?

27:55.173 --> 27:57.258
Or, whatever. I can ask him.

27:59.552 --> 28:01.429
You're a computer programmer, right?

28:02.389 --> 28:04.349
No, actually, I'm--

28:04.432 --> 28:07.977
Yeah, but would you be able to tell
where someone posted an Instagram from?

28:09.771 --> 28:11.648
Actually, yeah.

28:13.900 --> 28:15.610
-Here.
-It's easy.

28:22.909 --> 28:24.119
You know where Chase is now?

28:24.202 --> 28:26.955
Yeah, I got an e-mail from him
saying he's living in Dubai,

28:27.038 --> 28:28.832
working for the Sheikh, or something,

28:28.915 --> 28:32.335
trying to develop futurism technology.
Which is total bullshit.

28:32.419 --> 28:34.170
Does he have a phone number, or…

28:34.254 --> 28:37.924
No, he told me he only believes
in face-to-face contact now.

28:38.007 --> 28:40.719
So if you want to meet,
you've to e-mail him to set up a time.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.846
I think he's hiding out
from our investors.

28:42.929 --> 28:43.763
Yeah.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.976
I've e-mailed him a bunch.
He's not going face-to-face with me.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.566
Paul won't shut up about how I don't have

28:54.649 --> 28:57.110
clear and persuasive evidence
that I have a story.

28:57.193 --> 28:59.988
Paul was an intern
when I was writing cover stories.

29:00.071 --> 29:03.283
You know what you tell Paul?
You tell him to suck it.

29:04.826 --> 29:06.035
How about these?

29:06.578 --> 29:09.622
Mmm. A pair of panties
that has its own display case

29:09.706 --> 29:11.624
cannot be a pair of panties I can afford.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.252
The cost of buying your subject's candor.

29:14.335 --> 29:17.672
I'm not buying her candor,
underwear is a basic necessity.

29:19.007 --> 29:21.134
$47.50.

29:21.843 --> 29:23.887
Jesus. Are you kidding?

29:25.388 --> 29:26.931
For something no one's gonna see.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.100
You don't know what Anna's up to in jail.

29:31.227 --> 29:33.438
Her love life is mystifying to me.

29:33.521 --> 29:34.731
Whatever she did to Chase,

29:34.814 --> 29:37.358
he was so wrecked,
he's gone completely off the grid.

29:38.318 --> 29:41.070
How can you go off the grid
when you're working for the Sheikh?

29:41.154 --> 29:42.489
What if he wants to call you?

29:42.572 --> 29:44.741
If he's working for the Sheikh,
he's at a hotel.

29:44.824 --> 29:49.078
Probably something five star,
within a couple of miles of the palace.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.915
If you think traffic is bad in New York.

29:53.583 --> 29:57.378
I spent some time there
reporting on the Libyan Civil War,

29:57.462 --> 29:59.756
in a very nice hotel,
courtesy of the Sheikh.

29:59.839 --> 30:01.758
Not by choice, but still.

30:04.719 --> 30:06.179
I'm not buying $50 panties.

30:06.930 --> 30:11.059
Hi, um, I'm friends with Chase Sikorski.
May I be connected to his room?

30:12.393 --> 30:13.728
No? Thank you.

30:14.354 --> 30:17.607
Do you have a guest
by the name of Chase Sikorski?

30:19.317 --> 30:20.151
Got it.

30:20.235 --> 30:24.572
Chase Sikorski? S-I-K-O-R-S-K-I.

30:24.656 --> 30:25.782
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

30:25.865 --> 30:27.826
-That's okay. Thank you.
-No, that's okay.

30:27.909 --> 30:28.743
Thanks.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.837
By any chance,
do you have a guest staying with you

30:38.920 --> 30:41.047
by the name of Chase Sikorski?

30:47.178 --> 30:48.221
<i>Hello.</i>

30:49.097 --> 30:53.101
Hi. Chase, this is Vivian Kent
from <i>Manhattan Magazine.</i>

30:54.310 --> 30:55.937
-Fuck.

31:01.150 --> 31:03.736
We'll try again, another day.

31:33.391 --> 31:34.392
Ohio?

31:43.610 --> 31:44.777
<i>This is Suze.</i>

31:45.612 --> 31:49.657
Hi, my name is Vivian Kent
from <i>Manhattan Magazine.</i>

31:49.741 --> 31:51.409
I'm sorry to bother you.

31:51.492 --> 31:54.454
I was wondering if I could speak
with you about your son?

31:54.537 --> 31:56.122
<i>No, this is not…</i>

31:56.205 --> 31:58.750
<i>Chase hasn't been home</i>
<i>since God knows when,</i>

31:58.833 --> 32:01.753
<i>and I'm sure he wouldn't like me</i>
<i>speaking to a reporter.</i>

32:01.836 --> 32:02.837
<i>So I'm sorry--</i>

32:02.921 --> 32:05.882
Did you happen to meet
his girlfriend, Anna Delvey?

32:15.141 --> 32:17.769
-Vivian? I don't see the--
-I don't have your underwear.

32:17.852 --> 32:19.312
-Huh.

32:19.395 --> 32:22.106
But guess who I talked to?

32:23.191 --> 32:24.859
Suze Sikorski.

32:25.485 --> 32:26.736
I love Susan.

32:26.819 --> 32:28.446
And she loves you too.

32:28.529 --> 32:31.783
And you loved Chase.

32:32.575 --> 32:35.161
You went all the way to Ohio
to meet his family.

32:35.662 --> 32:38.331
It was a real relationship, you loved him.

33:18.579 --> 33:19.831
Are you lost, young lady?

33:19.914 --> 33:20.999
Who is it, Rog?

33:21.541 --> 33:24.293
-Oh! Oh, aren't you pretty?

33:24.377 --> 33:25.920
Can we help you with something?

33:26.004 --> 33:26.879
Hey, Dad?

33:29.549 --> 33:30.383
Anna.

33:32.593 --> 33:34.387
Chase was a convenience to me.

33:35.847 --> 33:40.393
He was available, like a game show host,
or a used-car salesman.

33:42.353 --> 33:47.066
I enjoyed the mind games for a while,
but once I figured him out, I got bored.

33:47.150 --> 33:51.237
In the end, I realized he never had
an original thought in his entire life.

33:53.406 --> 33:54.365
You're adopted?

33:54.449 --> 33:56.617
Why do you say
you're the child of immigrants?

33:56.701 --> 33:57.994
I am.

33:58.077 --> 34:00.705
My mom came here from Canada
when she was two.

34:01.789 --> 34:03.166
Look, I… I went to Berlin,

34:03.249 --> 34:05.501
but my parents reached out,
and I hadn't been home--

34:05.585 --> 34:08.171
Will you stop lying?
What's going on with Wake?

34:09.005 --> 34:13.509
-It's fine. It's--
-No. It's… it's not fine.

34:13.593 --> 34:16.512
You lost your offices,
your designer says you owe him money,

34:16.596 --> 34:19.474
the beta was to be dropped off last week.
What is going on?

34:19.557 --> 34:23.061
It's just… It's a start-up.
You know, stuff comes late.

34:23.144 --> 34:25.480
Then why are you here licking your wounds,

34:25.563 --> 34:27.648
instead of back in New York,
making the app?

34:27.732 --> 34:29.233
Why don't you pay Raphael to work--

34:29.317 --> 34:32.612
Because there isn't any more money.
Okay? We ran out of money.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.409
What do you mean you ran out of money?

34:38.493 --> 34:43.164
I mean, there's no more money.
None. It's all gone.

34:43.247 --> 34:46.751
How do you run out of $3 million?
I mean, where did it go?

34:46.834 --> 34:50.254
Some of it to paying people,
some of it on travel to promote the app.

34:51.756 --> 34:53.966
-And a lot of it on you.
-On me?

34:54.050 --> 34:55.760
You wanted a certain lifestyle.

34:55.843 --> 34:57.720
Are you fucking kidding me?

34:57.804 --> 34:59.639
You were the one
who wanted to run to Ibiza,

34:59.722 --> 35:02.183
who's been running all around
promoting the app

35:02.266 --> 35:03.684
instead of actually building it.

35:03.768 --> 35:07.021
You want to blame it on the woman,
to make me out to be some princess.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.981
-Are you--
-That's not what I'm trying to do!

35:09.065 --> 35:12.276
Look, I've got employees
and investors breathing down my neck,

35:12.360 --> 35:15.863
Kickstarter funders threatening me
over their Wake iPhone cases and T-shirts.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.657
And you can't possibly imagine

35:17.740 --> 35:20.076
the amount of pressure I'm under
to make this thing work.

35:20.159 --> 35:22.578
Right, I wouldn't understand.

35:22.662 --> 35:25.456
No, of course, I know
you're trying to build something too,

35:25.540 --> 35:26.541
but don't you see?

35:26.624 --> 35:29.460
This is why
I haven't been able to help with ADF.

35:29.544 --> 35:31.963
If I can dig myself out of this hole,

35:32.046 --> 35:34.090
I can give my full attention
to helping you,

35:34.173 --> 35:35.758
which is all I want to do.

35:41.430 --> 35:42.682
What're you going to tell Nora?

35:43.766 --> 35:45.351
We can't tell Nora anything.

35:46.519 --> 35:48.896
Nora's friend is on the verge
of giving us two million.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.648
If she finds out, it's game over.

35:50.731 --> 35:52.984
We just need to lay low with her
for a couple weeks

35:53.067 --> 35:56.529
until the investment comes in,
and then it's all ADF.

35:59.824 --> 36:02.410
"A dream we dream alone, is only a dream."

36:03.661 --> 36:08.457
"A dream we dream together,
we can make anything reality."

36:09.709 --> 36:10.585
John Lennon.

36:12.753 --> 36:13.754
Please, Anna.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.675
We're a team, right?

36:20.887 --> 36:21.804
I…

36:37.028 --> 36:38.362
That must've been disappointing.

36:38.446 --> 36:40.281
People are always disappointing.

36:42.450 --> 36:44.160
That must be very lonely

36:44.243 --> 36:46.746
to be the person
who speaks seven languages,

36:46.829 --> 36:48.998
with a photographic memory,
and so many talents,

36:49.081 --> 36:51.292
and to never find anyone who can keep up.

36:54.337 --> 36:55.838
I like being alone.

37:02.595 --> 37:05.139
Don't come back without what I asked for.

37:20.738 --> 37:22.240
Chase Sikorski's room, please.

37:25.368 --> 37:26.202
<i>Hello?</i>

37:27.078 --> 37:30.081
You aren't just some guy,
you're not just another source.

37:30.164 --> 37:32.250
Actually, you are the star of my article.

37:34.377 --> 37:37.255
Anna? Maybe she's good,
maybe I'm being fooled,

37:37.338 --> 37:41.717
but if you look at the facts,
it's you who's the con artist.

37:42.426 --> 37:45.429
It was you who left Val and Anna
high and dry during Fashion Week.

37:45.513 --> 37:48.224
It was you
who talked your way onto Hen's yacht.

37:48.307 --> 37:51.644
It was you
who had a business defrauding investors,

37:51.727 --> 37:55.731
and if I don't get your side of the story,
that's what I have to print.

37:56.941 --> 38:00.611
Or if you tell me what you know,

38:00.695 --> 38:03.614
we can correct some of that.
Keep your name out of things.

38:03.698 --> 38:08.911
I can just call you the "tech boyfriend."

38:18.462 --> 38:23.426
<i>How about "the futurist"?</i>
<i>Has a better ring than "tech boyfriend."</i>

38:23.509 --> 38:26.512
The futurist? I… I love it.

38:28.514 --> 38:29.473
So…

38:30.474 --> 38:32.351
What happened between the two of you?

38:36.981 --> 38:39.734
Oh, you're back! How was Berlin?

38:39.817 --> 38:41.110
It was great.

38:41.193 --> 38:43.654
You know, the Germans
have a reputation for coldness,

38:43.738 --> 38:46.490
but I found them
to be very dream oriented.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.034
How wonderful!

38:48.117 --> 38:50.244
Anna, if I order some lunch,
you'll go pick it up.

38:52.079 --> 38:53.080
-Mm.
-Hmm.

38:53.581 --> 38:54.749
So, tell me everything.

38:54.832 --> 38:57.668
Did you see Val in Berlin?
I mean he's there so often.

39:19.398 --> 39:21.901
Absolutely,
we'd love an investment.

39:22.651 --> 39:25.029
No, I wouldn't call it a dream journal.

39:25.738 --> 39:26.906
It's a…

39:28.157 --> 39:32.078
It's a new way
to tap into your subconscious.

39:34.246 --> 39:35.081
Uh-huh.

39:36.248 --> 39:38.876
Yeah, you know,
99% of people forget their dreams

39:38.959 --> 39:40.836
within ten minutes of waking up,

39:40.920 --> 39:43.756
but if we can intervene
before those memories slip away--

39:45.257 --> 39:48.010
Yeah, we use voice recording software
within the app…

39:50.596 --> 39:51.430
Exactly…

39:52.556 --> 39:53.432
Do you need this?

39:53.974 --> 39:55.851
Oh, that's all right.

39:55.935 --> 39:58.354
It's good to get your hands dirty
once in a while.

39:58.437 --> 39:59.355
Hmm.

39:59.438 --> 40:03.067
See, the microbes in soil
have antidepressant properties.

40:03.150 --> 40:05.486
Hmm. Then I should get into gardening.

40:05.569 --> 40:08.280
Hmm. Are those my glasses?

40:08.906 --> 40:10.950
No. They're mine.

40:12.284 --> 40:13.786
-Hmm.
-You look…

40:15.079 --> 40:16.872
-Thank you.

40:18.207 --> 40:20.042
Have you heard from Val, lately?

40:20.126 --> 40:21.710
No, I haven't. Have you?

40:21.794 --> 40:22.628
Mm-mm.

40:23.337 --> 40:25.756
It's unlike him
to be out of contact, isn't it?

40:25.840 --> 40:26.674
I think so.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.510
Did something happen during Fashion Week?

40:31.512 --> 40:34.390
Nothing really. Except, well…

40:36.225 --> 40:37.893
There was this night,

40:37.977 --> 40:43.816
we were all staying at this hotel
and having so much fun,

40:44.650 --> 40:46.110
but then they locked us out.

40:47.027 --> 40:48.112
What do you mean?

40:48.612 --> 40:52.491
The hotel took all of our possessions
and Val couldn't get his pills.

40:52.575 --> 40:54.743
Oh, he's a wreck without his pills.

40:54.827 --> 40:55.870
Right?

40:55.953 --> 40:58.581
Well, why would the hotel do that?

40:58.664 --> 41:01.292
Well, I would have paid,

41:01.375 --> 41:05.629
but my father can be
so domineering with my trust.

41:06.505 --> 41:08.924
I think he's jealous of my business plans.

41:11.760 --> 41:12.595
And Val--

41:12.678 --> 41:15.389
Val can never afford anything, of course.

41:15.473 --> 41:18.350
Fashion salaries.
But… but who was planning to pay?

41:21.353 --> 41:26.358
Chase was supposed to pay,
but then he just disappeared.

41:28.611 --> 41:31.906
He left us completely in the cold.

41:32.573 --> 41:34.116
But why would he do that?

41:35.075 --> 41:36.619
I don't really know.

41:38.829 --> 41:40.539
Did you two have a fight? Or--

41:40.623 --> 41:42.666
No.

41:43.417 --> 41:47.755
But you know how everything is going
with the company and--

41:47.838 --> 41:48.756
With Wake?

41:52.134 --> 41:53.302
Say more things.

41:54.803 --> 41:55.804
You don't know?

41:56.931 --> 42:01.227
Well… I hope I didn't
put my foot in my mouth.

42:01.310 --> 42:03.896
I assumed that, you know, as his advisor--

42:03.979 --> 42:05.481
Say more things.

42:13.197 --> 42:16.867
If I tell you,
promise you didn't hear it from me.

42:25.876 --> 42:29.672
Anna, tell me more about,
what is it, your business?

42:29.755 --> 42:31.549
Um, my social club?

42:31.632 --> 42:33.300
What are you calling it again?

42:33.384 --> 42:35.469
-The Anna Delvey Foundation.
-Hmm.

42:35.553 --> 42:38.055
We've been running up
against some obstacles with that though.

42:38.138 --> 42:42.393
I've been thinking we should change it,
to avoid any accusations of vanity.

42:42.476 --> 42:44.311
Oh, that is such a male perspective.

42:44.395 --> 42:46.855
Why shouldn't a woman
use her own name for her business?

42:46.939 --> 42:50.401
If she doesn't believe she's the name
to bring people in, who else will?

42:51.902 --> 42:54.613
It's aspirational,
just like I want my club to be.

42:54.697 --> 42:57.241
Sure, but you want the name
to speak to what you're doing.

42:57.324 --> 42:58.158
Like with Wake--

42:58.242 --> 43:00.327
When I founded
Nora Radford and Associates,

43:00.411 --> 43:02.538
no one cared who I was.

43:02.621 --> 43:04.748
I made it work, and you know why?

43:04.832 --> 43:08.419
Every time anyone wanted
to take it from me, they failed

43:08.502 --> 43:10.713
because you can't
run Nora Radford and Associates

43:10.796 --> 43:12.172
without Nora Radford.

43:14.049 --> 43:17.261
If I had called it
some half-baked, one-syllable buzzword,

43:17.344 --> 43:18.887
who knows where I'd be now.

43:20.306 --> 43:22.850
If you want your foundation to succeed,

43:23.517 --> 43:26.395
you need to secure connections
in the art world.

43:27.438 --> 43:31.775
I'm attending a party tomorrow afternoon
for the Storm King Art Center,

43:32.359 --> 43:34.528
a fundraiser
for the inner city arts program.

43:35.112 --> 43:36.322
Right, I'm your date.

43:37.281 --> 43:38.616
Do you have plans?

43:39.158 --> 43:41.243
Oh, I don't think so.

43:41.327 --> 43:44.204
Good. You'll come with me then.
You don't mind, do you, Chase?

44:08.729 --> 44:10.689
I had to tell her
what's up with the company.

44:10.773 --> 44:11.982
Really? Why?

44:13.609 --> 44:17.279
She asked to see the company records,
and I had to tell her we were struggling.

44:18.405 --> 44:19.490
Fuck!

44:19.990 --> 44:22.951
Out of nowhere she asks that,
and now she's asking about ADF?

44:23.661 --> 44:28.499
Just because she's taken an interest in me
doesn't mean she can't help you too.

44:28.582 --> 44:32.211
Yeah, but that's not how Nora works.
She has tunnel vision.

44:32.294 --> 44:34.797
And now the Greer investment
is probably off.

44:34.880 --> 44:37.925
Don't worry,
it will all come together when it's ready.

44:42.930 --> 44:43.931
Kismet.

44:49.561 --> 44:51.939
Yeah. That's… Okay.

44:52.856 --> 44:55.150
I guess I should have known
Anna had said something,

44:55.234 --> 44:57.736
but I tend to give people
the benefit of the doubt.

44:57.820 --> 44:59.571
<i>But that's when I knew.</i>

44:59.655 --> 45:02.533
It was pretty obvious
what had happened.

45:02.616 --> 45:03.450
What did you do?

45:03.534 --> 45:07.162
<i>I was always supposed to go with Nora</i>
<i>to the Storm King fundraiser,</i>

45:07.246 --> 45:10.624
<i>so I was still on the list.</i>

45:14.044 --> 45:16.255
A celebration
of garbage as artifact.

45:16.338 --> 45:18.549
It's the juxtaposition
of ambient soundscapes.

45:18.632 --> 45:21.677
Immateriality in dialogue
with transitory spaces.

45:21.760 --> 45:23.971
It's a performance piece
celebrating the color blue.

45:24.054 --> 45:25.597
It's very post-modern.

45:25.681 --> 45:26.849
Ooh, champagne.

45:29.810 --> 45:31.478
Everyone's here.

45:34.314 --> 45:36.108
Everyone and anyone, I see.

45:39.319 --> 45:40.904
I want you to meet some people.

45:40.988 --> 45:43.615
Michael, I want to
introduce you to Anna Delvey.

45:43.699 --> 45:44.867
-Oh.
-Mm-hmm.

45:44.950 --> 45:48.203
Anna, Michael is one of
the youngest gallerists in the world.

45:48.287 --> 45:49.955
-Oh.
-He has gorgeous taste.

45:50.038 --> 45:51.790
Anna is starting an Arts Foundation.

45:51.874 --> 45:53.041
Sounds spectacular.

45:53.125 --> 45:56.044
Well, Nora has been
an amazing mentor for me,

45:56.128 --> 45:58.297
helping me get my business off the ground.

45:58.380 --> 46:02.426
You know, she's a huge supporter
of young female entrepreneurs.

46:02.509 --> 46:04.762
Well, of course I am.
It's a passion of mine.

46:07.765 --> 46:10.434
Sasha, I'd like to introduce you
to my friend, Anna Delvey.

46:10.517 --> 46:13.061
Oh! Well, we've met.

46:13.145 --> 46:17.149
-Anna, I didn't realize you knew Michael.

46:17.232 --> 46:20.819
This is Richie, one of
the most exquisite chefs in the world.

46:20.903 --> 46:22.780
I would die without Nobu.

46:22.863 --> 46:25.073
He does the best food
for all the best events.

46:25.157 --> 46:27.409
Well, I'd love to
have you on board.

46:29.495 --> 46:31.663
I got a call about you, from Richie.

46:31.747 --> 46:33.665
We'll have to design
a space around his menu.

46:33.749 --> 46:34.792
We will.

46:34.875 --> 46:39.296
Well, you know Donna,
Jodie, Patricia, Susan.

46:39.379 --> 46:41.465
Everyone, this is Anna, my protégé.

46:41.548 --> 46:42.841
Ooh.

46:42.925 --> 46:46.762
You know, we must
lift up young female entrepreneurs.

46:49.515 --> 46:52.601
-I keep getting calls about you.

46:52.684 --> 46:57.523
From my friend, Jodie Kleinsmith,
from Gabriel Calatrava, from Sasha Thomas.

46:57.606 --> 46:59.233
It seems like you know everyone.

46:59.316 --> 47:01.902
I know a few people.

47:01.985 --> 47:03.487
So I said to my father

47:03.570 --> 47:05.614
the future isn't just derivatives

47:05.697 --> 47:08.283
and moribund institutions
from the last century--

47:08.367 --> 47:09.201
Amen to that.

47:09.284 --> 47:10.577
Can I talk to you?

47:11.745 --> 47:14.623
Chase! Please, excuse me.

47:20.128 --> 47:21.171
Anna.

47:23.382 --> 47:24.258
Anna!

47:24.341 --> 47:27.469
No, I've gone out of my way
to help your company,

47:27.553 --> 47:29.304
to get you investments,

47:29.388 --> 47:33.016
to listen to your dreams metaphorically,
and fucking literally--

47:33.100 --> 47:37.563
Do you forget I know the truth about you?
I saw your passport.

47:44.027 --> 47:45.195
What about you?

47:45.946 --> 47:50.492
Always lying about your company,
about where you come from,

47:50.576 --> 47:54.830
inflating every detail
to portray some image.

47:55.497 --> 47:56.874
You're from Ohio.

47:56.957 --> 47:58.625
And you judged me the moment you saw it.

47:58.709 --> 48:00.502
I loved your parents.

48:00.586 --> 48:02.880
They're wonderful,
with their little house.

48:02.963 --> 48:05.757
I would have loved to grow up
in a house like that, instead of--

48:05.841 --> 48:08.135
Instead of what? Huh? Who are you?

48:08.218 --> 48:09.970
Because I know you're not German.

48:11.722 --> 48:15.934
Chase, everything about you is a lie.

48:16.768 --> 48:19.605
At least I'm doing what I set out to do.

48:19.688 --> 48:22.941
You have no stamina, you walk away
the second…

48:23.025 --> 48:24.276
…work gets hard.

48:25.611 --> 48:27.988
Because you're shitty at business.

48:30.449 --> 48:33.160
Everything you know about business,
I have taught you.

48:34.369 --> 48:36.747
You have taken everything from me.

48:36.830 --> 48:40.626
My friends, my lifestyle, my line of work,
and now Nora, I guess.

48:42.044 --> 48:43.670
Hey, you're just a fucking copy of me.

48:43.754 --> 48:46.673
Well, I'm
a gold-dipped fucking copy.

48:50.135 --> 48:51.720
I want 40% of ADF.

48:51.803 --> 48:52.638
What?

48:52.721 --> 48:56.183
For everything I taught you,
everyone I introduced you to. Yeah, 40%.

49:01.730 --> 49:05.108
"A dream you dream alone,
is only a dream."

49:06.443 --> 49:09.738
"A dream you dream together, is reality."

49:11.531 --> 49:13.033
I know. Anna…

49:13.617 --> 49:17.454
John Lennon didn't say that,
it was Yoko Ono.

49:27.464 --> 49:29.716
When we got back to Nora's,

49:30.801 --> 49:32.719
I assumed Anna would stay,

49:32.803 --> 49:36.348
but she packed her things
and left later that night.

49:37.683 --> 49:41.019
<i>But why, after everything with Nora?</i>

49:42.604 --> 49:43.897
I don't know.

49:45.023 --> 49:47.359
I guess it was all just a game to her.

49:48.694 --> 49:49.778
What was it to you?

49:58.328 --> 50:00.247
In the end, she's in prison,

50:00.330 --> 50:03.500
and I'm working to further
future technology in a new world.

50:03.583 --> 50:06.169
<i>You know, Dubai is an incredible place.</i>

50:06.253 --> 50:09.089
<i>If you really want a story,</i>
<i>I can connect you with the Sheikh</i>

50:09.172 --> 50:11.049
<i>to explore some projects we're working on.</i>

50:11.883 --> 50:13.719
So you're on Chase's side now?

50:13.802 --> 50:15.929
No, I'm definitely not on his side.

50:16.847 --> 50:20.225
He's just as tricky as her.
I'm not on anyone's side.

50:20.308 --> 50:21.143
Anymore.

50:21.226 --> 50:23.895
I wasn't ever on Anna's side. She's just…

50:24.730 --> 50:25.981
She's a little fascinating.

50:27.232 --> 50:31.069
For example, who spends months
making someone their mentor,

50:31.153 --> 50:34.281
only to pack up and cut off contact
as soon as they succeed?

50:34.364 --> 50:36.908
She's a lone wolf,
she couldn't be part of a pack.

50:36.992 --> 50:38.910
And she was on to better digs.

50:39.661 --> 50:41.163
I think it was more than that.

50:41.246 --> 50:44.750
I think something happened
between them, it had to have.

50:45.459 --> 50:46.501
Whenever Anna happens,

50:46.585 --> 50:49.046
there's usually
some kind of disaster zone in her wake.

50:49.129 --> 50:50.547
Did you check with the defense?

50:50.630 --> 50:52.299
Todd is a complete dead end.

50:52.382 --> 50:53.842
There's always two sides.

50:54.926 --> 50:56.344
I'm telling you. I'm not on…

50:58.930 --> 51:01.725
There's always two sides. Yes, there are.

51:09.149 --> 51:10.442
Miss Kent?

51:10.525 --> 51:13.820
What lofty question
is keeping me from my lunch today?

51:13.904 --> 51:17.616
Did a Nora Radford
ever file a complaint on Anna Sorokin?

51:19.618 --> 51:23.205
That question is practically an insult
to New York's finest pastrami sandwich.

51:23.288 --> 51:26.166
Of course I'm not going to answer that.
Try the defense.

51:27.334 --> 51:28.168
It's just…

51:29.711 --> 51:31.671
The way my story is shaping up,

51:31.755 --> 51:34.382
the real crook in all of this
was Anna's boyfriend.

51:34.466 --> 51:38.178
If I print now, it'll look like you have
the wrong guy or, you know, girl.

51:38.970 --> 51:40.472
Then your story is inaccurate.

51:40.555 --> 51:42.474
My sources all say otherwise.

51:57.489 --> 52:00.075
I can't share anything
that was in the discovery with you.

52:01.576 --> 52:05.330
But I can share something
that didn't make it into discovery

52:05.413 --> 52:09.209
because someone changed their mind
about pressing charges.

52:16.466 --> 52:19.177
Oh, Vivi, I must say
I'm surprised to see you here again.

52:19.261 --> 52:20.428
I thought I made it clear--

52:20.512 --> 52:22.848
Why didn't you mention
your credit card records?

52:31.314 --> 52:33.775
Hello? Breakfast tomorrow?

52:35.277 --> 52:36.111
Mmm-hmm.

52:39.447 --> 52:41.283
What do you mean
there are strange charges?

52:42.742 --> 52:43.952
Mmm-hmm.

52:45.287 --> 52:46.121
Uh-huh.

52:46.204 --> 52:52.961
<i>Neiman's, $800.</i>
<i>Barneys, $4,000. Bergdorf's, $17,000.</i>

52:53.044 --> 52:53.879
Oh, God.

52:55.046 --> 52:57.340
Do you have a list
of what was bought at Bergdorf's?

52:58.049 --> 52:59.885
<i>Size eight Valentino pumps,</i>

53:01.219 --> 53:05.182
<i>CELINE sunglasses, a Sandro black dress…</i>

53:06.308 --> 53:08.351
<i>A Balenciaga handbag…</i>

53:15.275 --> 53:18.820
Miss Radford left for the day,
but said you'd be adding some things.

53:18.904 --> 53:20.405
Will you be signing for her account?

53:20.488 --> 53:21.448
Hmm.

53:29.456 --> 53:33.251
Actually Miss Radford wanted me
to grab a few more things.

53:33.335 --> 53:39.216


53:40.467 --> 53:44.679


53:44.763 --> 53:48.725


53:48.808 --> 53:51.269
Good to see you again.
A few more things for Miss Radford?

53:51.895 --> 53:53.021
Thank you, Ashley.

53:53.897 --> 53:58.860


54:04.282 --> 54:08.411
Oh, Anna, we're all ordering
some take-out. Do you want anything?

54:08.495 --> 54:09.412
Oh.

54:09.496 --> 54:10.830
I could eat.

54:10.914 --> 54:13.375
Great. Right down the street.
It'll be ready in 20.

54:26.513 --> 54:29.391
<i>Bergdorf Goodman,</i>
<i>Nong La Thia,</i>

54:29.474 --> 54:32.560
<i>Uber, Seamless, American Airlines,</i>

54:32.644 --> 54:35.438
<i>getbeautified.com, NET-A-PORTER--</i>

54:35.522 --> 54:37.107
Fucking cunt!

54:39.401 --> 54:42.320
$400,000.

54:43.446 --> 54:45.573
Why didn't you say she stole from you?

54:46.658 --> 54:48.076
My finances are private.

54:50.036 --> 54:54.791
You could have pressed charges,
helped stop her from…

54:56.126 --> 54:57.544
It was humiliating.

54:59.587 --> 55:03.258
She took advantage of me,
and I had no idea.

55:04.050 --> 55:06.636
Why do you think she did it, looking back?

55:07.637 --> 55:10.682
I would have given her money,
probably, if she asked.

55:11.433 --> 55:13.893
I mean, she worked so hard
to draw me in and then…

55:16.146 --> 55:17.522
You know the most absurd part?

55:18.315 --> 55:21.484
After all that, Anna sent me a gift.

55:22.610 --> 55:24.946
A thank you or threat. I'm not sure.

55:28.408 --> 55:29.993
If you press charges with the DA,

55:30.076 --> 55:32.203
you might still be able
to get your money back.

55:32.871 --> 55:34.080
Oh, I got all my money back.

55:34.956 --> 55:37.334
My friend, Donna, works at Federal Credit.

55:37.417 --> 55:38.418
Works, well…

55:38.501 --> 55:39.586
She's the CEO.

55:42.213 --> 55:44.507
You got it all back?

55:45.633 --> 55:47.844
$400,000?

55:47.927 --> 55:49.387
You know what really gets me?

55:49.971 --> 55:52.766
When Bergdorf's accepted
all those purchases she made.

55:52.849 --> 55:57.020
I shop there constantly, I have a rack.
They knew my taste.

55:57.103 --> 55:58.313
That girl had trash taste.

55:58.396 --> 56:00.440
Did they really think
any of that was mine?

56:01.900 --> 56:03.276
-Ugh!

56:03.360 --> 56:04.569
Here it is.

56:12.160 --> 56:13.661
<i>Nora, you got a package.</i>

56:18.333 --> 56:19.626
Oh!

56:19.709 --> 56:20.585
Okay.

56:22.128 --> 56:23.963
Here. Right.

56:25.632 --> 56:26.466
Okay.

56:35.725 --> 56:36.643
Open it.

56:49.030 --> 56:49.864
Oh.

56:53.743 --> 56:54.953
Nora gave it to me.

56:57.539 --> 57:02.377
It's probably worth more than every piece
of furniture in this apartment,

57:02.460 --> 57:04.921
and she just gave it to me.

57:14.180 --> 57:15.306
What do we do with it?

57:16.516 --> 57:17.684
College fund.

57:19.477 --> 57:20.478
College fund.

57:28.945 --> 57:30.321
These don't look like Bergdorf.

57:30.405 --> 57:32.282
They'll do the job,
and you'll accept them.

57:32.365 --> 57:35.827
You know why?
Because I know about Nora's credit cards.

57:36.661 --> 57:38.580
I know about you
throwing Chase under the bus,

57:38.663 --> 57:40.957
I know about the peacock.

57:41.040 --> 57:43.668
I have a story with or without you.

57:44.669 --> 57:47.255
So, if you want any control
of how you're portrayed,

57:48.047 --> 57:49.382
you need to start talking.

57:52.886 --> 57:55.305
I forgot about that fucking peacock.

57:56.973 --> 57:58.766
Did you steal all that money?

58:02.145 --> 58:04.856
You have to work hard
to get what you want.

58:04.939 --> 58:07.734
I've always known that.
Chase, not so much.

58:08.318 --> 58:12.197
He thought he was
better than me, smarter than me.

58:12.280 --> 58:14.115
And Nora…

58:14.199 --> 58:16.493
…she treated me like I was a prop,

58:16.576 --> 58:18.870
and so, why shouldn't I
have used her as one?

58:21.164 --> 58:24.501
I got everything I needed, my dream team.

58:25.752 --> 58:27.045
And Nora's credit cards?

58:28.087 --> 58:29.547
Did you? Really?

58:31.674 --> 58:33.218
I like this underwear.

58:36.638 --> 58:40.016
It's always important
to have quality clothing.

58:45.688 --> 58:50.860
I made a pitch deck, you know,
with my whole business plan, and my team.

58:50.944 --> 58:54.989
It would be helpful for you
to see it before we meet next.

58:59.953 --> 59:01.120
Thanks for the panties.

59:09.295 --> 59:11.589
-For the panties I bought your client.
-Excuse me?

59:11.673 --> 59:14.425
-I bought panties yesterday.
-I'm not paying for her panties.

59:14.509 --> 59:16.553
I'm not asking for a reimbursement,

59:16.636 --> 59:21.349
I want you to realize
that we are on the same side.

59:21.432 --> 59:26.271
I am buying your client undergarments
because I care about this story.

59:26.354 --> 59:28.106
That's a weird way of showing it.

59:28.189 --> 59:31.818
And I know you are dealing
with the same kind of shit from her.

59:31.901 --> 59:34.571
Maybe not panties, but 37 calls a day.

59:37.699 --> 59:41.035
She is driving me fucking crazy.
I am exhausted.

59:41.119 --> 59:43.621
Let me help you.

59:43.705 --> 59:45.790
Let me be part of the team.

59:46.749 --> 59:49.586
She said there's a deck she made for ADF,
that I should see it.

59:49.669 --> 59:50.795
She wants me to see stuff.

59:52.422 --> 59:55.967
No lawyer is going to ever invite
a journalist to dig into his discovery.

59:56.050 --> 59:59.637
Come on. I know
she's done some bad shit, but I'm not--

59:59.721 --> 1:00:02.432
But even the best lawyer
slips up sometimes,

1:00:03.182 --> 1:00:07.270
takes a coffee break, say,
and leaves his discovery unattended.

1:00:11.858 --> 1:00:12.692
Thank you.

1:00:14.319 --> 1:00:15.361
Thank you.

1:01:09.415 --> 1:01:10.875
Pretty clear and persuasive.

1:01:16.422 --> 1:01:18.174
Why don't you take a couple more weeks?

1:01:28.393 --> 1:01:31.062
-I keep getting calls about you.

1:01:31.145 --> 1:01:35.566
From my friend, Jodie Kleinsmith,
from Gabriel Calatrava, from Sasha Thomas.

1:01:36.067 --> 1:01:37.652
It seems like you know everyone.

1:01:37.735 --> 1:01:40.363
I know a few people.

1:01:40.446 --> 1:01:42.156
Well, we must find you a property.

1:01:43.825 --> 1:01:45.284
I want 281 Park.
