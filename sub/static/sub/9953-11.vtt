00:01.001 --> 00:03.617
- Previously on Haven...
- It's the bolt-gun killer.

00:03.795 --> 00:06.628
What if he's not using body parts
for trophies?

00:06.798 --> 00:08.663
What if he's building a woman?

00:09.927 --> 00:12.213
- You're the bolt-gun killer.
Nathan figured it out.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.802
- Tell me where the barn is.
- What's so important about the barn?

00:16.975 --> 00:19.717
- When Audrey goes inside,
both she and it disappear.

00:19.895 --> 00:23.683
And once they're both gone,
the Troubles in Haven stop.

00:23.815 --> 00:25.430
We all go back to normal.

00:25.609 --> 00:27.770
- He went that way.
- Don't hit him.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.481
Take out the engine.

00:32.366 --> 00:35.824
- That burned body
is Detective Thomas Bowen.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.825
- Wait. We were working with--
- Somebody.

00:37.955 --> 00:41.413
But whoever it was, it wasn't
Detective Thomas Bowen from Boston.

00:41.583 --> 00:45.075
- The bolt-gun killer is still alive.
I found out where he's hiding.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.955
(gasping)
lt's Tommy.

00:50.926 --> 00:52.462
He wears people's skin?

00:52.553 --> 00:54.089
- Means he could be anyone.

01:00.519 --> 01:03.807
- I'm sorry that you have to see this.
- Me, too.

01:03.981 --> 01:07.894
So where are the other cops and the guys
who put the stuff in the baggies?

01:08.068 --> 01:12.152
- This is a need-to-know crime scene.
- What exactly do we all need to know?

01:12.322 --> 01:16.065
- The, uh... creepy coroner guy outside
said that we were on the list.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.286
Oh.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.910
- Our paper gets the exclusive, right?

01:21.081 --> 01:23.948
- This isn't about a story or volunteer cops.

01:24.126 --> 01:25.957
- It's about the bolt-gun killer.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.671
Tommy Bowen.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.583
- Oh, my God, that's his...

01:35.262 --> 01:38.379
I thought Tommy was the bolt-gun killer.
- So did we.

01:38.557 --> 01:41.139
The real Tommy was murdered
and skinned several weeks ago.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.016
The killer assumed his identity.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.687
- There's a...

01:44.855 --> 01:46.891
a skinwalker in Haven?

01:48.400 --> 01:50.516
- So where is he?
- Who is he?

01:50.694 --> 01:52.605
- We don't know. He escaped.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.270
But we have an idea
on a way to find him.

01:55.449 --> 01:58.907
- The thing is, Tommy made a series
of rookie mistakes.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.453
I hardly noticed them at first,

02:00.621 --> 02:02.953
but when you add 'em all up,
there's no way he could be a trained cop.

02:04.249 --> 02:07.958
- I would... I would just like you to note
that I told you so. I told you so!

02:08.128 --> 02:10.414
- The skinwalker sounds
and looks like his victims,

02:10.589 --> 02:13.581
but he doesn't know what they know.
- It's a performance.

02:13.759 --> 02:16.922
He can steal their voice, their appearance,
but he can't steal their minds.

02:17.095 --> 02:20.963
- So we can you catch him
using secrets, memories.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.756
It would be like a test.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.674
- Well, hot damn, kids.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.344
Sounds like one hell of a plan.
When do we start?

02:29.107 --> 02:30.608
- I already have.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.937
The killer picked Tommy.
He was someone who was already in our circle.

02:36.114 --> 02:39.948
- We know he's looking for information
on Audrey and the Colorado Kid.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.577
- He's been with us the whole time
and I bet he still is.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.908
- What are you saying?
- When we're done here,

02:46.083 --> 02:48.495
I need you all to go down to the station.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.380
One of us could be the skinwalker.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.589
- Including you.
- We're all suspects.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.131
(barking)

03:01.306 --> 03:02.887
- Stay here.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.264
- What do you got?

03:09.189 --> 03:11.054
- I'm not usually here for this part
of the process.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.682
- We needed someone we could trust.

03:19.408 --> 03:21.524
- The ground's cold.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.738
The bodies are well-preserved.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.070
- Another vic over here.

03:27.249 --> 03:28.614
- This is his dumping ground.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.999
For the victims he kills for parts.

03:39.511 --> 03:42.423
Between the body pit and those interviews,
l was just...

03:42.597 --> 03:45.589
l was hoping for more answers today.
- Me, too.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.883
Long day.
- Yeah.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.347
But I'll take as many of those as I can get.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.558
- There ’3 nothing more you can do today,
Parker.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.306
Try and get some rest.

03:54.484 --> 03:55.815
- Nathan?

03:56.653 --> 04:00.441
Hey, if it turns out that l... | go away,

04:00.615 --> 04:03.527
there are some things
that I want you to know.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.238
- Sounds important.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.323
- Yeah, it’s important and...

04:09.166 --> 04:10.622
...overdue.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.329
- Then let's not do it over the phone.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.786
I'll see you soon.

04:18.633 --> 04:20.464
- Okay.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.456
(door closing)

05:04.429 --> 05:06.340
- You’ve reached Nathan Wuornos.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.221
Leave me a message.
(beep)

05:08.391 --> 05:11.519
- Hey, um, I was just calling...

05:14.773 --> 05:16.559
Actually, I...

05:16.733 --> 05:20.066
I don't know why I was calling.
I just thought maybe...

05:20.946 --> 05:22.777
maybe you'd be up.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.067
Anyway, I'll...

05:25.700 --> 05:27.565
I'll see you at the office.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.751
(horn honking)

05:43.009 --> 05:44.465
(honking)

05:47.222 --> 05:48.962
Sir?

05:53.228 --> 05:54.889
Oh, no. Sir?

05:55.772 --> 05:57.273
Oh, no.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.896
Sir, are you...?

06:03.989 --> 06:05.320
(ringing)

06:08.410 --> 06:09.775
What the...?

06:34.102 --> 06:36.309
(theme music)

07:18.521 --> 07:19.977
Oh, no.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.391
Okay. All right.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.612
Nathan?

07:31.660 --> 07:32.775
Nathan!

07:32.953 --> 07:34.784
Wake up.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.240
Wake...

07:36.539 --> 07:38.325
Okay, still breathing.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.244
Everyone else is breathing.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.875
Then what the hell is happening here?

07:43.046 --> 07:46.288
- Every one of these women
has some specific part of her body removed.

07:46.424 --> 07:49.712
- Just like the other victims we found.
- He's looking for the right pieces,

07:49.886 --> 07:52.093
building a custom model, someone special.

07:52.222 --> 07:55.009
- I can't even imagine
what that would look like.

07:56.518 --> 07:59.851
But I guess anything's possible in Haven,

07:59.980 --> 08:02.346
even wearing patchwork skin.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.230
- That's his mistake.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.938
We're gonna ID all of these victims.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.812
- Then we're gonna finish the composite
of the woman that he's making.

08:09.990 --> 08:13.323
- When we know who she is,
maybe we can figure out who he is.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.074
- And the connection to me,
the Colorado Kid,

08:15.245 --> 08:18.863
the Hunter meteor storm, all of it.

08:20.792 --> 08:23.750
(sighing)
He just took what he wanted.

08:24.212 --> 08:26.077
Her life...

08:26.256 --> 08:28.212
heers”.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.584
All he left her with was...

08:32.762 --> 08:34.798
was this. A puffin earring.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.093
No dignity.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.179
- He must have a plan.

08:40.353 --> 08:43.186
Question is, now that we're closing in,
what's his next move?

08:43.314 --> 08:45.305
- Whatever it is, I don't want him to hurt
more innocent people.

08:45.483 --> 08:48.771
He can deal with me directly.
I'm ready for it.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.231
- We ’re ready.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.566
- Stop right there.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.947
- Who are you?

09:40.121 --> 09:42.783
- Just gear down there, champ.
l-l'm the guy without a gun.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.948
- That doesn't mean
that you're still not dangerous.

09:45.126 --> 09:48.618
- Right, 'cause only the most
hardcore criminals roll in one shoe.

09:48.797 --> 09:52.289
- What happened to you?
How'd you get here?

09:55.095 --> 09:56.881
And why are you the only person
who's awake?

09:57.055 --> 10:00.047
- Hey, you're awake too.
My name's Audrey Parker.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.965
From Haven Police Department.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.593
Now your turn. Where's your ID?

10:06.356 --> 10:08.597
- My... my wallet's gone.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.859
Come to think of it, I...
I don't know who I am.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.769
I don't remember anything.

10:14.948 --> 10:18.861
- Amnesia? You're gonna give me amnesia?
- No, look, I'm being serious.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.069
All I remember is waking up
by the side of the road.

10:22.247 --> 10:24.363
I saw you in your car and I followed you.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.248
- Was everyone unconscious
around you, too?

10:27.418 --> 10:29.409
- Yes, Officer Skeptic.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.628
Look, l-l'm lost, all right?

10:31.798 --> 10:33.959
My foot's killing me
and l have no idea

10:34.134 --> 10:37.092
why I'm wearing this ridiculous T-shirt.

10:37.262 --> 10:41.255
If you think I'm lying, just shoot me.
- You're right. That T-shirt is pretty lame.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.759
Listen, I'm not saying
that I believe you, but...

10:46.813 --> 10:49.350
Why don't you take me
to the place where you woke up?

10:49.524 --> 10:51.230
- I'd be happy to.

10:51.401 --> 10:52.891
Just, uh, put the gun away

10:53.069 --> 10:55.606
and keep your hands
where I can see them.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.286
I came to right here.

11:02.412 --> 11:05.620
- And you don't remember
what you were doing right before then?

11:05.790 --> 11:08.122
- No. Probablyjust out for a walk.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.420
- That's odd.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.962
- Isn't all of this odd? I mean...

11:15.175 --> 11:17.211
At least you know your name.

11:21.389 --> 11:22.799
- Stay here.

11:29.314 --> 11:31.851
All right. The driver's okay.

11:39.407 --> 11:40.738
- Ah.
- You're welcome.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.115
- Thanks.

11:44.162 --> 11:47.495
- So it's likely you were being
transported to the hospital.

11:47.916 --> 11:50.749
That must mean that you were ejected
from the ambulance.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.828
- All right, well, why would I be going
to the hospital? I mean...

11:55.006 --> 11:56.712
I don't have any injuries. | feel fine.

11:56.883 --> 12:00.000
- Maybe you healed yourself.
- Maybe I did what?

12:00.637 --> 12:03.424
- Have you, uh...
have you heard of the Troubles?

12:03.598 --> 12:05.179
- Is that a band or something?

12:05.350 --> 12:07.932
- Okay... listen to me.

12:08.102 --> 12:09.228
Haven is a special place.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.896
People can do things.

12:11.064 --> 12:14.431
Sometimes those things,
they... come at a cost.

12:14.609 --> 12:17.851
- Got it. Special place. Things cost...

12:18.029 --> 12:20.020
- I think that you were traumatized.

12:20.156 --> 12:23.148
Whatever sent you to the hospital,
that brought out your Trouble,

12:23.326 --> 12:25.817
and that has caused
everybody else to fall asleep.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.446
(chuckling)

12:30.750 --> 12:34.413
- You're serious? 'Cause that's the
craziest thing I've ever heard in my life.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.750
Let me... let me fill you in.
Naptime is not a superpower.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.915
- They're not superpowers, they're curses.
- Oh, curses.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.800
Why didn't you open with curses?
Curses make sense.

12:42.971 --> 12:45.838
Come on, if I'm so cursed,
why are you still awake?

12:46.015 --> 12:48.802
- I'm immune to the Troubles.
- How convenient.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.763
Look, you know what I think?

12:51.938 --> 12:54.680
I think maybe I got the supernatural
flu shot, and you're causing this.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.393
What d'you think of that?

12:56.567 --> 13:00.810
- I think we need to go to Haven PD.
You can argue with me on the way there.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.233
Why are you arguing with me?

13:03.408 --> 13:06.775
You know that l have to test you first.
- Why?

13:06.953 --> 13:08.443
(scoffing)

13:08.621 --> 13:11.738
- So that you can help me
test everyone else?

13:15.128 --> 13:17.244
Tell me about our first session.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.913
- Well, our first meeting
was kind of a nonstarter,

13:20.091 --> 13:22.833
because you were... resistant,

13:23.011 --> 13:24.751
to put it nicely.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.544
- Okay. And after that?

13:26.723 --> 13:30.136
- You bonded with a dog instead of me,
which I found highly insulting.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.426
But the dog was adorable.

13:32.603 --> 13:36.437
- Everybody saw me with that dog.
- A dog you later gave up as a metaphor

13:36.607 --> 13:39.314
for pushing Nathan away
because you didn't want him to suffer,

13:39.485 --> 13:42.227
like another man you once loved: your son.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.612
And because I'm such a good friend,

13:44.782 --> 13:48.491
l lent you my good push-up bra,
which you can keep, by the way.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.572
(Audrey chuckling)
And then later that night,

13:50.747 --> 13:53.864
we went to the Gull, remember?
After your crazy golem case.

13:58.212 --> 14:01.079
and we worked on that facial composite.
And that's when I discovered

14:01.257 --> 14:03.873
that the bolt-gun killer was--
- Building a woman.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.626
Well done.

14:06.804 --> 14:09.386
I had to test you too, right?

14:09.515 --> 14:11.221
And...

14:11.392 --> 14:13.098
if we're getting all specific,

14:13.269 --> 14:15.430
I did not loan you
that push-up bra until--

14:15.605 --> 14:16.970
- Until after the haunted house.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.810
- You, Audrey Parker,
are not the skinwalker.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.394
- And neither are you.

14:23.905 --> 14:26.988
Okay, all right, let's go ahead
and bring the next person in.

14:27.158 --> 14:28.944
- Hey, slow down a minute.

14:29.118 --> 14:32.155
- I can't slow down.
I only have a few more days left

14:32.330 --> 14:33.740
before I disappear.

14:33.915 --> 14:36.827
- Well, a few days is a lot of time,
in some ways.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.788
You know, Audrey,
I know what it's like

14:39.962 --> 14:42.874
to lose someone so suddenly that you...

14:44.509 --> 14:46.215
You're lucky, Audrey.

14:47.178 --> 14:51.046
You have the chance to say goodbye to Nathan
and everyone else, if you want to.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.675
Just think about it.

14:59.357 --> 15:03.942
- Someone must've called 911 Emergency
if they were gonna get you an ambulance.

15:04.904 --> 15:08.112
- Oh... so the report would have
my name and address.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.690
Okay, you are smart.

15:10.827 --> 15:11.987
(typing)

15:13.538 --> 15:17.497
- All right, I'm gonna go ahead and print out
the 911 activity log for...

15:18.543 --> 15:20.124
- What was that?

15:20.253 --> 15:22.494
(sighing)
- It was a power surge.

15:22.630 --> 15:23.915
(typing)

15:28.886 --> 15:31.548
The server's down.
- Wha...?

15:32.974 --> 15:36.432
C'mon, don't tell me you think
my magic Trouble put your system to sleep.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.718
- Or you did it on purpose,
'cause now I can't look up fingerprints

15:38.896 --> 15:40.887
or anything else
that would tell me who you are.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.681
- I'm not hiding my identity.
I just don't know it.

15:43.818 --> 15:46.275
lt's retrograde amnesia.
The inability of the patient

15:46.446 --> 15:48.983
to access any memories
prior to regaining consciousness.

15:50.408 --> 15:53.491
Whoa. Where'd that come from?

15:53.619 --> 15:56.201
- That's some serious medical science.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.583
- You have cop face.
I sense a theory coming.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.919
- Follow me.

16:11.554 --> 16:13.010
- Who's this guy?

16:14.140 --> 16:15.630
- My partner.

16:15.766 --> 16:19.475
I know you might be a doctor,
and if I can't wake him up,

16:19.604 --> 16:23.392
how long before
he starves or... something?

16:31.199 --> 16:33.030
- He's not sleeping.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.532
No one is.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.906
This is a coma.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.789
- Okay. People wake up from comas.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.828
Why are you so serious?
- This kind of coma's different.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.920
It's a degenerating coma.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.297
Look.

16:50.468 --> 16:53.585
There's distension at the base of the skull
and swelling.

16:53.721 --> 16:57.384
lt'll put pressure on the brain stem.
- And then what happens?

16:57.517 --> 16:59.599
- Involuntary muscle signals shut down.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.683
They all stop breathing.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.554
- How long do we have?
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.599
I'm not gonna be responsible
for putting a deadline

17:07.735 --> 17:09.600
on thousands of people's lives.

17:09.737 --> 17:12.149
I could just be a guy
who's obsessed with WebMD.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.613
- I'm willing to take that chance. How long?

17:14.742 --> 17:16.653
(sighing)

17:16.827 --> 17:18.488
- 12 hours.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.574
Maybe less.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.497
Till everyone in Haven suffocates and dies.

17:31.884 --> 17:35.627
- We have less than 12 hours
before your Trouble kills everyone in Haven.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.716
We gotta do something.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.848
- Wow, okay,
I'm actually starting to believe you.

17:40.977 --> 17:43.138
Uh, what do we do? I wanna help.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.894
- We gotta figure out who you are
and what your Trouble is.

17:46.065 --> 17:49.603
Then we gotta find out a way to reverse it.
- Yeah, but I don't remember anything.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.109
Except that I like fries and gravy,

17:52.280 --> 17:55.613
and l have a hankering
for a super-hoppy beer.

17:55.741 --> 17:59.108
- That's good. You're having a memory flash.
Can you think of anything else you like?

17:59.287 --> 18:02.120
Do you have any favourite restaurants,

18:02.290 --> 18:04.246
or, um, hobbies? Sports?

18:04.417 --> 18:05.953
- Sports.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.542
Yeah, um... basketball.

18:08.671 --> 18:10.286
|... Ithink.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.204
- Good. We're getting somewhere.
Were you a player?

18:12.383 --> 18:13.793
Do you have a favourite team?

18:13.968 --> 18:15.833
- Okay, this may sound weird,

18:16.012 --> 18:17.968
but I'm seeing a ram.

18:18.139 --> 18:21.882
You know, with the hooves and,
you know, the big round horns.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.557
- You know what? I...

18:23.728 --> 18:26.014
I got an idea. Let's go.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.941
- This is awkward.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.479
- Not for long.
You have the easiest test ever, Duke.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.358
We're just gonna use a drop
of Troubled blood.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.742
- I don't think that's a good idea.

18:41.912 --> 18:44.164
- Well, assuming you are Duke,

18:44.290 --> 18:46.952
you'll just go all silver-eyed
and get super strength.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.832
But don't break anything,

18:49.003 --> 18:51.119
and don't throw me across the room.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.709
- Audrey, is this what you want?

18:53.883 --> 18:55.464
- We need to be sure.

18:55.593 --> 18:58.335
It has to be something unique to you.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.761
- That night in Nederland,

19:04.894 --> 19:08.933
after we found out about Arla Cogan,
the Colorado Kid's wife...

19:11.108 --> 19:14.976
You want me to keep going?
- Yes. Yes, she does.

19:20.785 --> 19:23.071
- You remember how confused you were?

19:23.204 --> 19:25.115
- You could've guessed that.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.492
- And you remember
how you were questioning everything?

19:30.628 --> 19:34.871
And I told you that I would help you
do whatever you wanted to do.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.292
- And then what happened?

19:44.975 --> 19:47.227
- And then you kissed me.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.559
- No way.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.064
Did you two...

19:51.190 --> 19:53.431
- Okay, Duke, you're good.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.984
You're not the skinwalker.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.692
You can... you can go now.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.243
- All right.

20:04.328 --> 20:07.570
- I'm kind of happy
that you two spent a minute in Make-Out Town

20:07.707 --> 20:10.449
before this whole barn situation happened.
- Hey!

20:10.626 --> 20:13.834
I find most of what you say mildly amusing,

20:14.004 --> 20:18.088
but stop talking about this barn situation
like it's a done deal. It's not!

20:18.217 --> 20:20.754
- No one's giving up on Audrey yet, Duke.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.510
But we have to face the reality.

20:23.681 --> 20:25.421
- And the reality is...

20:25.599 --> 20:29.968
that if I go into that barn
when the Hunter meteor storm hits Haven,

20:30.146 --> 20:32.011
the Troubles disappear.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.857
For 27 years, they're gone.

20:49.165 --> 20:52.373
- Wow. This is one sad-looking happy hour.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.753
- Here. Over here.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.753
(chuckling)

20:57.923 --> 21:00.005
- An even sadder-looking wall of fame.

21:00.134 --> 21:03.422
- Well, these are actually
all the local Haven rec teams.

21:03.554 --> 21:05.419
- Well, that makes it better.

21:05.556 --> 21:07.672
- Here, what do you see?

21:09.685 --> 21:11.266
- It's a ram mascot.

21:11.437 --> 21:14.395
A sad and beautiful ram mascot.
Nice work.

21:14.565 --> 21:17.307
You probably spend
way too much time drinking here.

21:17.443 --> 21:20.560
- I actually, uh, live upstairs.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.937
- That's a tempting offer,
but we have work to do.

21:23.073 --> 21:25.234
- North Haven Rams.

21:25.409 --> 21:27.445
It's a men's basketball team.

21:27.578 --> 21:30.285
- Looks like a bunch
of out-of-shape high-school teachers.

21:30.414 --> 21:33.406
- Yeah, especially the guy on the left
in that lame T-shirt.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.666
- That's me.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.961
Th-that's me. Th-this is amazing.

21:41.842 --> 21:44.675
- And now you have a name.
- Will Brady.

21:44.804 --> 21:47.295
My name is... Will Brady.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.012
- Nice to meet you, Will.

21:52.436 --> 21:55.303
- Brady, that's... that's Irish, right?

21:55.439 --> 21:58.272
Could I be Irish doctor Will Brady?

21:58.400 --> 22:00.231
- Well, let's...

22:01.487 --> 22:04.103
let's go to your place and find out.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.989
- You look worried.

22:08.118 --> 22:10.734
- We're running out of suspects
in our circle.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.532
- You two are clear and you think

22:12.706 --> 22:14.958
there's a good chance
I could be the skinwalker?

22:26.720 --> 22:30.053
The first time I felt your touch
was the day you kissed me.

22:33.811 --> 22:35.301
Here.

22:37.731 --> 22:40.188
It was such a small thing for you.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.226
But for me, I...

22:49.326 --> 22:51.317
I hadn't felt anything...

22:53.038 --> 22:55.290
for... a long time.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.714
I can feel you now.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.673
- Wow. Again.

23:05.801 --> 23:08.838
But I have some bad news.

23:08.971 --> 23:10.586
- What?

23:10.723 --> 23:13.260
- The skinwalker steals skins, not Troubles,

23:13.434 --> 23:16.972
so he would totally be able
to feel Audrey as well,

23:17.104 --> 23:18.640
just like anyone else.

23:18.772 --> 23:21.149
- I remember that day, Claire.

23:21.942 --> 23:23.443
It's Nathan.

23:24.695 --> 23:25.935
It's him.

23:33.162 --> 23:35.494
(door opening, closing)

23:35.623 --> 23:38.285
- Well, I can't wait to hear
who else you've kissed.

23:38.459 --> 23:40.120
Should we get Stan in here?

23:53.098 --> 23:55.805
- I'm sure if I could remember
how much I paid for that,

23:55.935 --> 23:58.267
I'd be pretty upset with you right now.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.183
- Will Brady.

24:02.316 --> 24:05.524
PhD in archaeology.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.109
- So I am a doctor.

24:07.237 --> 24:10.149
Indiana Jones style. Very cool.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.068
- But... you're not an MD,

24:12.242 --> 24:14.654
so how do you know so much
about comas?

24:14.787 --> 24:16.869
- I, too, must be a genius.

24:17.998 --> 24:20.455
Who needs a feather duster.
This place is filthy.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.700
- It seems like you haven't been here
in a while.

24:22.836 --> 24:25.999
But this is your house.
This is... your stuff.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.713
Nothing coming back to you?

24:28.842 --> 24:30.798
- Nope. Sorry.

24:33.722 --> 24:35.883
- Wait. I recognize this earring.

24:36.016 --> 24:37.677
(whispering): A puffin.

24:38.519 --> 24:41.010
- I don't wear earrings. Let me see it.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.146
- Stop.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.599
Don't come any closer.

24:46.735 --> 24:50.227
- Hey, come on, we're back to this now?
You know who I am.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.355
I'm the guy with the Trouble thing.

24:54.576 --> 24:57.192
You don't put people to sleep.
You kill them.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.990
And then you take their skin,

24:59.123 --> 25:01.614
and you get rid of the rest of them,
like garbage.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.665
You're the skinwalker.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.791
- |-|'m the What?

25:12.970 --> 25:16.087
- You're the skinwalker,
and you almost had me, you sonofabitch.

25:16.265 --> 25:18.301
- You can't shoot me
if I don't even know what that is.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.430
- This isn't a joke!

25:19.601 --> 25:22.764
You have five seconds to start talking to me.
- Okay, look, look, even if I...

25:22.938 --> 25:26.476
if I was the... the skin thing,
I don't... I don't remember it.

25:26.984 --> 25:28.565
- This earring.

25:28.986 --> 25:30.522
Where did you get this?

25:30.696 --> 25:34.234
- Maybe gaudy animal jewellery
is my thing. I don't know!

25:34.366 --> 25:35.867
- That's convenient.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.989
You killed the owner of that earring.

25:41.248 --> 25:42.749
- Of this?

25:47.337 --> 25:48.998
I remember now.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.330
I remember. This...

25:51.508 --> 25:53.339
this belonged to my friend.

25:55.262 --> 25:56.718
Erin.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.550
Her name is Erin.

25:58.724 --> 26:02.842
- Come on, you can remember her name,
but you couldn't remember your own?

26:03.020 --> 26:05.181
- It must've knocked
the memory loose somehow.

26:06.940 --> 26:10.524
- No, you remember her
because you killed that woman.

26:12.071 --> 26:15.234
I'm gonna lock you up and I'm gonna
solve this coma Trouble on my own.

26:15.365 --> 26:18.402
- Ten minutes ago you thought
I was the one causing everybody's coma.

26:18.535 --> 26:21.151
So whether or not I'm the skin man,

26:21.330 --> 26:25.949
finding a way to get my memory back
is the only way we can stop all of this.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.666
Right?

26:29.254 --> 26:30.710
- Right.

26:30.839 --> 26:34.798
- Well, we got six hours left by my count.
So we either work together,

26:34.968 --> 26:38.176
or we risk letting everyone die.
So what do you say?

26:39.473 --> 26:43.341
- This does not mean we're on the same team,
because we are not.

26:43.477 --> 26:46.014
- Yeah, I'm... I'm getting that.

26:46.146 --> 26:49.513
So what the hell is a skin... guy,

26:49.691 --> 26:52.558
and... and what does it have to do
with this earring?

26:54.279 --> 26:56.361
- I'll show you.

26:56.490 --> 27:00.529
- We would know if one of us
wasn't ourselves anymore.

27:02.412 --> 27:05.324
- And we're just supposed
to take that at face value?

27:05.457 --> 27:08.290
- I know my brother. He knows me.

27:08.418 --> 27:11.410
We're not pod people.
(both chuckling)

27:11.547 --> 27:14.630
- Fine. Let's talk about the skinwalker.

27:15.551 --> 27:18.258
He kidnapped and tortured you both.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.878
And he took you as prisoners?

27:21.014 --> 27:22.970
No offense, but--

27:23.142 --> 27:25.554
- But he shot Nathan
when he got in the way.

27:25.686 --> 27:27.551
Why didn't he kill you two?

27:27.688 --> 27:30.395
- Oh, we know an awful lot
about this town.

27:30.524 --> 27:32.560
Emphasis on "awful".
(chuckling)

27:32.693 --> 27:34.729
- What else did he ask you?

27:35.696 --> 27:38.108
- He wanted to know
where the Colorado Kid was.

27:38.240 --> 27:41.107
We had no idea.
We still don't. And that's it.

27:41.243 --> 27:42.904
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

27:43.078 --> 27:45.285
He didn't ask you anything else?

27:45.414 --> 27:47.621
- Sorry. No.

27:47.749 --> 27:51.788
He only asked about the Colorado Kid,
nothing else.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.956
So can we go already?

27:54.131 --> 27:55.621
- Audrey, you can't keep us here.

27:55.799 --> 27:57.960
We got a newspaper to run.
- Wrong.

27:58.093 --> 28:01.051
One of you could still be the skinwalker.
You haven't proven yourselves yet.

28:01.180 --> 28:04.468
- No, they can go. For now, anyway.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.683
You wanna know how I know
you're both you?

28:10.314 --> 28:12.680
'Cause you're not telling me everything.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.478
Again.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.982
Jane Doe... number two.

28:20.866 --> 28:24.358
She had her lips cutoff,
probably by you.

28:24.578 --> 28:26.034
Take a look.

28:28.123 --> 28:29.988
- Really? Do I have to?

28:30.125 --> 28:31.456
- Yes.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.467
- Ah! It's Erin.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.301
I remember how she died.

28:49.186 --> 28:52.678
Not all of it, but... but enough.

28:52.814 --> 28:55.191
- Tell me.
- We were walking together,

28:55.317 --> 28:56.932
back... from a movie.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.652
Zorro. The Mark Of Zorro.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.313
We gotjumped.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.942
I got hit in the back of the head,

29:07.079 --> 29:10.822
and I went down and I couldn’t speak.
I couldn’t move.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.739
Couldn’t really see his face.

29:13.877 --> 29:17.369
They were struggling and...
the bastard pulled her in,

29:17.547 --> 29:20.038
and he Whispered something to her.
He... said something...

29:20.217 --> 29:21.627
He said, "Hush."

29:21.760 --> 29:27.050
And then he put this weird gun thing
to the back of her head and he killed her.

29:27.182 --> 29:28.797
(bolt gun firing)

29:30.269 --> 29:32.760
He just killed her and dragged her away.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.317
- And he left you for dead?

29:41.488 --> 29:44.230
- Next thing I remember
is waking up this morning.

29:46.118 --> 29:49.861
It doesn't make sense. I know.
I mean, my head feels fine now.

29:50.539 --> 29:53.030
- I'm sorry.
That... that doesn't prove anything.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.699
You got the description
of that bolt gun just right.

29:55.877 --> 29:58.459
The victim would know that,
but so would the killer.

29:58.588 --> 30:01.876
- I couldn't have hurt her! I loved her.

30:03.385 --> 30:06.127
And she loved these stupid earrings.

30:07.347 --> 30:10.009
I never told her how I felt.
That night I was going to.

30:10.142 --> 30:11.973
I was gonna tell her everything.

30:13.603 --> 30:17.312
I was just always waiting for the...
for the right time, you know?

30:19.276 --> 30:20.516
- Yeah.

30:22.571 --> 30:24.402
Yeah, I do know.

30:26.325 --> 30:29.738
Wait. That movie that you saw,
that was a classic, wasn't it?

30:29.911 --> 30:32.163
How did you... how did you see that?

30:34.082 --> 30:37.745
- The Haven Arts Festival, I think.
- But...

30:37.919 --> 30:40.752
that... that was two months ago.

30:42.716 --> 30:46.254
If you really are Will Brady
and you weren't skinned or killed,

30:46.386 --> 30:48.763
then where were you
for the last two months?

30:49.306 --> 30:51.092
- How the hell should I know?

30:51.224 --> 30:54.716
- If you were injured,
then you would've been in the hospital.

30:54.853 --> 30:59.062
Maybe... that ambulance
wasn't taking you to the hospital.

31:00.692 --> 31:03.855
Maybe it was taking you from it.

31:11.328 --> 31:13.444
The face and the neck.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.445
There's more discolouration.

31:15.582 --> 31:18.699
It's the same with the nurse.
They're getting worse.

31:18.835 --> 31:22.373
- They only have a couple hours left, tops.
All of them.

31:26.343 --> 31:28.299
Audrey, I... I know these two.

31:28.428 --> 31:30.760
That's Greg and... and Whitney.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.470
This is my brother and sister.

31:32.599 --> 31:35.932
What are they doing here?
- Let's find out.

31:36.061 --> 31:38.143
We'll find your room in the records.

31:46.780 --> 31:49.567
This is your chart, Will Brady.

31:55.997 --> 31:59.615
Look at this. You were found two months ago
with a severe head trauma.

31:59.793 --> 32:02.409
You were... in a coma.

32:02.546 --> 32:05.083
- C'mon, you're saying
I was here the whole time?

32:05.215 --> 32:06.876
Th-that's wrong. It has to be.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.715
- The machines kept you stable,
but if you were ever unplugged,

32:09.886 --> 32:12.093
the swelling would
put pressure on your brain stem,

32:12.264 --> 32:14.095
and in 12 hours,
you would stop breathing.

32:14.224 --> 32:16.931
- So everyone in town
is in the same coma I was in.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.437
- But how would you know
what was on your chart?

32:19.563 --> 32:22.020
- Y'know,
they say that some people in a coma,

32:22.149 --> 32:24.435
they actually can hear, still.

32:24.568 --> 32:28.561
I must've been listening.
I heard the doctors say this to my family.

32:28.697 --> 32:31.109
- But why were you being
taken away from the hospital?

32:32.951 --> 32:35.693
- 'Cause they actually did it.
They pulled the plug.

32:38.999 --> 32:42.366
- You were taken off your machines
at 7:00 am. today.

32:42.502 --> 32:45.665
Your family dressed you,
they sent your stuff home,

32:45.797 --> 32:48.664
and then they sent you home to...

32:48.800 --> 32:50.415
- To die.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.465
I never made it.

32:54.639 --> 32:57.221
That's why Greg and Whitney
are here in the hospital.

32:57.350 --> 33:00.717
They were here finalizing my death.
- You know, I... I think maybe,

33:00.896 --> 33:03.228
when you heard
you were gonna be unplugged,

33:03.398 --> 33:07.061
the fear of death,
it's what brought out your Trouble.

33:07.194 --> 33:09.276
- So in order for me to wake up,

33:09.446 --> 33:12.779
I sent everyone else into a coma instead.

33:13.825 --> 33:17.033
And now they're all dying,
just like I would've.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.742
- They don't call 'em Troubles for nothing.

33:21.875 --> 33:24.457
- Okay. Well, you know something, partner?

33:24.586 --> 33:28.625
I am awake and alive now, so...
so let's uncurse me.

33:28.798 --> 33:32.541
Let's... let's find a way
to wake everyone else up.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.586
Oh, c'mon, what? What now?

33:36.723 --> 33:39.385
- What if it's like flipping a switch?

33:41.269 --> 33:43.976
- And I have to go back into my coma.

33:44.105 --> 33:46.767
- Or else everyone in Haven dies.

33:51.696 --> 33:53.482
There's gotta be another way
to resolve your curse.

33:53.657 --> 33:55.363
Sometimes we talk it out,

33:55.534 --> 33:58.401
but you can't just save people
by going into a coma.

33:58.537 --> 34:02.405
Maybe you don't have to go away.
- You know what's funny?

34:03.250 --> 34:06.287
I remember my sister
saying something this morning.

34:06.419 --> 34:09.456
She always hated this T-shirt.
But my brother put me in it anyway.

34:09.589 --> 34:11.875
- Okay, we gotta stay on track.
Your curse--

34:12.008 --> 34:15.592
- It was a secret that he and I had.
This was my lucky pick-up shirt.

34:15.762 --> 34:18.799
I... I was supposed to man up
and use it on Erin.

34:18.932 --> 34:21.389
And I remember my sister saying that...

34:21.560 --> 34:26.475
it made her crazy I was still single
and maybe I could use it in the great beyond.

34:26.606 --> 34:28.517
- Will, they're dying.

34:28.692 --> 34:31.809
They need our help, okay?
We're running out of time.

34:32.028 --> 34:34.940
- Just enough time
to put me back into my coma.

34:36.658 --> 34:39.024
What else am I supposed to do?

34:41.913 --> 34:44.199
We need to go... now.

34:48.086 --> 34:50.498
So I figure if I come back here,

34:50.630 --> 34:54.373
where I supernaturally chose
to pull myself out of the coma, I can...

34:54.551 --> 34:58.089
supernaturally choose to put myself back in.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.007
All, uh...

35:00.181 --> 35:01.842
supernaturally like.

35:04.144 --> 35:06.009
Makes sense, right?

35:23.913 --> 35:25.198
Okay.

35:30.920 --> 35:34.458
All right now, don't let them
cut this shirt off. It's a winner.

35:36.259 --> 35:37.965
(sighing)

35:38.136 --> 35:39.797
Guess this is goodbye.

35:40.430 --> 35:42.386
It's been real, Audrey Parker.

35:42.557 --> 35:44.172
- Will Brady...

35:45.143 --> 35:46.679
I'll see you around.

35:46.895 --> 35:49.637
- Really? That's the best you got?

35:50.023 --> 35:53.311
- Yeah, I... I gotta get better at goodbyes.

35:53.443 --> 35:55.024
It's just...

35:55.195 --> 35:57.106
I know why you're doing this.

35:58.239 --> 35:59.615
You have to.

36:00.450 --> 36:02.486
It's for the good of everyone else.

36:04.621 --> 36:06.282
- Still sucks.

36:06.915 --> 36:09.406
- But you're saving lives.

36:09.542 --> 36:11.578
- That's just it, though. Y'know, I...

36:11.711 --> 36:13.747
I might never see them again.

36:15.882 --> 36:18.373
But... I have to do it.

36:19.636 --> 36:21.547
I'm outta time, right?

36:22.931 --> 36:27.425
(beeping)
If only I had... a few more hours.

36:29.479 --> 36:30.935
- A few days.

36:31.106 --> 36:32.812
- A few days?

36:32.982 --> 36:36.725
Parker, if I had a few days,
I'd fight this tooth and nail.

36:38.238 --> 36:40.354
- Maybe it isn't over.

36:40.490 --> 36:42.981
Maybe you can keep fighting, Will.

36:43.118 --> 36:45.325
(beeping)
Will?

36:46.830 --> 36:48.536
(beeping intensifies)

36:59.384 --> 37:00.965
- What happened? Did we crash?

37:01.094 --> 37:04.427
- You're okay, you just... you passed out.

37:04.556 --> 37:08.925
- Was there a gas leak or something?
- Yeah, it was a gas leak town-wide.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.436
Again.

37:10.603 --> 37:14.516
Never mind. I need you to turn your lights
and siren on, turn this thing around.

37:14.691 --> 37:16.977
Your patient needs
to get back to the hospital.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.100
Right now!

37:27.954 --> 37:31.412
- Stop that. Why is he even here?
We're supposed to meet him at home.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.699
- Who ordered this?
- I did.

37:33.877 --> 37:35.413
Detective Parker.

37:36.379 --> 37:38.085
- How dare you?

37:38.214 --> 37:41.172
We sent my brother home to die in peace.

37:41.301 --> 37:44.418
We made an impossible decision
and you think that you know better.

37:44.554 --> 37:47.216
- Will's still alive in there.
I can prove it to you.

37:47.390 --> 37:51.724
Listen, don't ask me how, but this morning,
when everybody was knocked out,

37:51.853 --> 37:53.844
I... I met him.

37:57.150 --> 37:59.516
I got to know him.

37:59.652 --> 38:02.359
- I'm calling security.
- This shirt?

38:02.530 --> 38:04.521
Your sister hates it.

38:04.699 --> 38:08.692
But it's his lucky pick-up shirt.
It's the one you got for him.

38:08.828 --> 38:11.820
- He could've told you that before.

38:11.956 --> 38:16.040
- This morning, you said it made you crazy
that Will was still single.

38:16.211 --> 38:19.248
Maybe he could use that T-shirt
in the great beyond.

38:19.380 --> 38:21.666
- How could you know I said that?

38:21.800 --> 38:23.290
- He told me.

38:24.761 --> 38:26.422
He can hear you.

38:26.554 --> 38:28.294
Everything you say.

38:33.353 --> 38:35.389
You can't give up on him.

38:37.899 --> 38:39.981
Maybe he can come back.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.731
We can hope that he will.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.406
- Oh, my God...

38:49.577 --> 38:52.319
I... can't believe we almost...

38:57.794 --> 39:00.001
- See you around.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.053
Hey.

39:17.146 --> 39:18.101
- Hey.

39:18.273 --> 39:22.357
- So... is the town believing
the gas-leak story?

39:22.527 --> 39:23.812
- Yeah.

39:23.987 --> 39:25.773
Again.
- Good.

39:27.323 --> 39:28.859
(sighing)

39:31.452 --> 39:33.579
- You okay?
- Yeah.

39:33.746 --> 39:36.488
It's just been a... it's been a long day.

39:37.959 --> 39:40.496
And I'm looking fonNard to a few more.

39:42.088 --> 39:43.589
I, um...

39:44.841 --> 39:47.833
I had a break in the skinwalker case.

39:47.969 --> 39:49.675
I ID'd one of the Jane Does.

39:49.804 --> 39:51.260
- Great.

39:51.431 --> 39:52.921
How?

39:53.057 --> 39:54.843
- She was a...

39:55.268 --> 39:57.759
She was a missed opportunity.

39:59.480 --> 40:02.972
A friend of mine never got a chance
to tell her how he felt.

40:05.945 --> 40:09.654
Nathan, I'm really sorry
that I pushed you away. I... I never...

40:11.826 --> 40:14.158
- Parker...

40:14.287 --> 40:16.323
I'm still here.

40:19.167 --> 40:20.498
- Yeah.

40:22.086 --> 40:23.826
- We'll have time for this...

40:24.881 --> 40:28.089
once we find a way to keep you here.

40:30.970 --> 40:32.801
We'll figure this thing out.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.971
Together.

40:45.526 --> 40:47.312
- Audrey, you're not talking.

40:47.445 --> 40:50.187
- I wasn't aware that this was a session.

40:50.323 --> 40:53.281
I asked you over so you that could help me
with the skinwalker case.

40:53.409 --> 40:57.778
- I know what you're not saying,
even when you're not... not saying it.

40:57.914 --> 41:00.075
- What am I not not saying?

41:00.208 --> 41:02.824
- You only have a few days left
before you go,

41:02.961 --> 41:04.997
and we should talk about that.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.211
- What if I wanna talk about not going?

41:07.340 --> 41:09.922
If I can catch the skinwalker,

41:10.051 --> 41:13.134
then maybe he can tell me about the barn

41:13.262 --> 41:16.390
and the Colorado Kid and... and me.

41:17.350 --> 41:20.638
And then maybe I don't have to go away.

41:22.772 --> 41:26.310
Session over.
Mission accomplished.

41:26.442 --> 41:27.773
- Fair enough.

41:27.944 --> 41:30.060
Where were we?

41:30.196 --> 41:31.857
- Vince and Dave.

41:32.031 --> 41:34.738
The skinwalker tortured 'em for info.

41:34.867 --> 41:37.449
- He grilled 'em about the Colorado Kid
and the barn.

41:38.705 --> 41:41.447
- I don't remember them mentioning the barn.

41:41.582 --> 41:43.288
- Sure they did.

41:45.753 --> 41:48.495
- Right, no, you're probably right.

41:49.632 --> 41:53.625
ljust, you know, the b...
the barn being the place that I go into,

41:53.761 --> 41:56.468
and the place that I probably die...

41:56.597 --> 41:58.724
I have no idea--
- Audrey, hush.

41:59.767 --> 42:01.098
- He said, "Hush."

42:01.227 --> 42:02.888
