00:46.292 --> 00:48.208
So here's the plan

00:48.625 --> 00:52.792
I've set a trap. The most
foolproof, amazing trap ever!

00:53.042 --> 00:55.417
Then, well just you watch...

00:56.042 --> 00:59.792
I told you before I'm the
best hunter in all of Candamo.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.542
and I'm only thirteen.

01:01.917 --> 01:05.167
One day, people will all be
saying, "Ainbo of Candamo,"

01:05.333 --> 01:08.167
"Greatest hunter in the whole Amazon!"

01:08.792 --> 01:11.625
But even the greatest
hunter could use a little help.

01:12.042 --> 01:13.417
That's where <i>you</i> come in.

01:13.625 --> 01:15.125
You're gonna help me catch him.

01:15.458 --> 01:17.500
Got It? Good.

01:18.250 --> 01:19.542
He's coming!

01:27.042 --> 01:28.167
I forgot bait!

01:34.708 --> 01:36.500
Hey! You stay here.

02:00.708 --> 02:01.708
No!

02:35.500 --> 02:37.542
It gets worse every day.

02:39.917 --> 02:41.917
More and more dead fish.

02:42.542 --> 02:45.875
Our people are dying
and many more are sick.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.833
Including me; It's the curse.

02:50.667 --> 02:52.417
But you're going to get better.

02:52.833 --> 02:56.083
Better or not, it's <i>your</i> turn, daughter.

02:56.458 --> 02:58.375
I'm not ready to take your place

02:59.417 --> 03:02.208
Do you think I was ready to be chief?

03:02.458 --> 03:06.458
At your age all I could
think about, was girls.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.875
and, well... girls!

03:09.167 --> 03:10.208
It's true.

03:10.625 --> 03:13.250
You're as ready as you'll ever be.

03:13.417 --> 03:15.292
But Candamo was different then

03:15.458 --> 03:17.333
Yes, I won't lie

03:17.500 --> 03:21.667
The forest was lush and
the river run crystal clear.

03:21.833 --> 03:24.625
And everyone in the village was happy

03:24.750 --> 03:26.917
But how can <i>I</i> end this curse?

03:27.167 --> 03:28.625
I don't know

03:28.833 --> 03:31.458
Maybe we're all the curse,

03:31.750 --> 03:33.083
our heartlessness.

03:33.167 --> 03:38.042
Bah! That's a bitter sick
man talking. Not the real you.

03:38.625 --> 03:41.250
You have everything he had at thirteen.

03:41.458 --> 03:45.458
You're strong, brave
and you have a good heart

03:45.792 --> 03:47.500
And you have a mission

03:47.750 --> 03:49.667
Save our village, Zumi.

03:50.083 --> 03:52.000
Save Candamo.

03:54.083 --> 03:56.750
I believe in you, Zumi.

03:58.792 --> 04:01.666
Now I need one amazing shot.

04:02.083 --> 04:03.500
steady...

04:13.458 --> 04:16.666
-Atok!
-Ah, the mighty huntress.

04:16.875 --> 04:19.166
If we don't hurry, we'll
miss the ceremony.

04:19.291 --> 04:21.500
We? I'm leaving now.

04:21.750 --> 04:24.833
Then get me down; Zumi will
be heartbroken if I'm not there.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
True. She thinks of you like a sister.

04:28.208 --> 04:30.500
But remember, you're not her sister

04:30.708 --> 04:32.167
You're not royalty.

04:32.292 --> 04:34.125
You're not some great huntress.

04:34.333 --> 04:37.750
You're just a girl hanging
upside down in her own trap.

04:37.875 --> 04:38.833
Cut me down!

04:39.000 --> 04:40.542
Cut yourself down.

04:41.417 --> 04:44.250
And never say, Atok
didn't try to help you.

04:47.458 --> 04:49.167
Just a girl!

04:49.417 --> 04:51.000
I'll show him.

04:59.458 --> 05:02.042
For her to disappear now, of all times.

05:02.167 --> 05:03.000
Zumi...

05:03.083 --> 05:04.042
-But...
-Enough

05:04.125 --> 05:05.917
The time for talk is over.

05:06.083 --> 05:09.750
You need to be strong. That's
what the village needs now.

05:09.917 --> 05:12.667
It's just... Ainbo is my best friend

05:13.208 --> 05:14.667
and I'm nervous

05:14.833 --> 05:19.458
Nervous? Terrified, I'm
sure. Why wouldn't you be?

05:19.667 --> 05:22.708
But Ainbo knows this. She'll be here.

05:23.417 --> 05:25.708
Okay, I believe you.

05:26.708 --> 05:28.708
You know Ainbo has a nickname for you?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.292
What? The old hag?

05:32.125 --> 05:33.375
Mama Chuni.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.750
That's how she thinks of you

05:36.083 --> 05:37.125
Mama.

05:37.250 --> 05:40.792
Ainbo's real mother
would be so proud of you.

05:40.917 --> 05:43.833
I wish she were here today too

05:44.042 --> 05:45.458
You are her mother now

05:46.167 --> 05:48.375
-It's time
-Yes

05:53.875 --> 05:56.500
-Pathetic
-Preposturous

05:56.708 --> 05:58.125
Pitiful

05:58.708 --> 05:59.917
Huh?

06:00.667 --> 06:02.125
Hello

06:05.542 --> 06:07.625
Now I'm seeing things.

06:10.917 --> 06:13.125
I've been hanging upside down too long.

06:13.667 --> 06:15.333
We're supposed to help <i>her</i> ?

06:15.667 --> 06:16.792
I think it's her

06:16.917 --> 06:18.333
I'ill be the judge of that.

06:18.500 --> 06:21.083
How do you know who I am? Who are <i>you</i> ?

06:21.208 --> 06:22.625
Smells like her.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.167
Don't try to sniff me!

06:25.333 --> 06:27.333
Hey, we're on your side

06:27.542 --> 06:30.125
No you're not! You're
a couple of mirages.

06:30.958 --> 06:33.042
We're your spirit guides!

06:33.125 --> 06:35.083
-My name is Dillo.
-I'm Vaca.

06:35.208 --> 06:38.750
We're sent to help you,
help Zumi, save Candamo.

06:38.833 --> 06:40.792
No, you are not real

06:40.917 --> 06:42.625
Fine. Insult us.

06:42.875 --> 06:45.000
Then you could hang upside down forever

06:45.208 --> 06:48.375
Alright, if you're real, get me down.

06:49.167 --> 06:50.250
Nothing to it.

06:50.792 --> 06:52.708
Grab your knife. It's that pointy thing.

06:52.875 --> 06:56.333
If I could grab the knife,
would I still be hanging here?

06:56.875 --> 06:59.500
-We could cut her down.
-But that's no fun.

06:59.667 --> 07:01.792
I'm about to miss the
biggest day of my life.

07:01.917 --> 07:03.625
Hey! You're shouting!

07:04.125 --> 07:06.083
You're right, I'm shouting at nothing

07:06.208 --> 07:09.208
-You're not really here
-Don't start that again

07:09.417 --> 07:11.542
Alright, if you're real,

07:11.708 --> 07:14.042
Get. Me. Down!

07:14.458 --> 07:15.375
I suppose.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.500
If you insist. I'll do it!

07:21.042 --> 07:22.625
What do you think you are doing?

07:26.750 --> 07:28.125
Now do you think we're real?

07:28.500 --> 07:30.208
I guess I have to.

07:31.458 --> 07:32.917
I guess you do.

07:33.250 --> 07:36.417
My spirit guides! Wow!

07:37.458 --> 07:39.208
Wait, I'm giving this back.

07:40.917 --> 07:43.875
Come on, let's go, we're already late.

07:56.875 --> 07:59.417
Ainbo, I will never forgive you for this.

07:59.875 --> 08:01.167
Hey! Spirit guides!

08:02.458 --> 08:03.750
Enough!

08:05.708 --> 08:09.792
Do you two mind! And
remember, a spectacular entrance!

08:09.917 --> 08:13.083
Spectacular is our middle name.

08:18.417 --> 08:23.250
The royal necklace has grown
heavy around my old shoulders.

08:23.707 --> 08:29.125
But now I can pass it on to
someone who can bare its weight.

08:29.417 --> 08:33.292
And lead our village to a brighter future

08:34.750 --> 08:36.082
Yes!

08:36.750 --> 08:41.500
And so I place this
necklace around Zumi's neck.

08:43.457 --> 08:49.875
Just as my father placed it
around my neck so many years ago.

08:51.375 --> 08:53.083
Yes!
-Zumi!

08:55.208 --> 08:56.208
Ainbo?

08:59.708 --> 09:01.417
I think you lost this

09:03.042 --> 09:05.208
Zumi, I brought you a gift

09:05.750 --> 09:08.708
It's not what I was planning
but this one's better.

09:08.917 --> 09:12.208
Not just better; the best gift ever!

09:12.500 --> 09:13.625
What is it?

09:14.542 --> 09:18.083
Maybe I should ride on top
of you and wave to the people.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.917
How about I drag you in by your tail?

09:23.125 --> 09:26.125
You all know about
our great jungle spirits.

09:26.417 --> 09:32.167
And you all know about the
terrible, awful, really horrible curse,

09:32.250 --> 09:34.042
that forced them to disappear.

09:34.792 --> 09:36.292
And the gift is...?

09:36.625 --> 09:40.708
My gift is that I've
brought the spirits back!

09:41.833 --> 09:42.833
What?

09:47.250 --> 09:50.625
Two of our sacred jungle
spirits appeared to me

09:50.875 --> 09:55.167
They said, "Ainbo, take us to
Zumi." "Your wish is our command."

09:58.833 --> 10:05.042
So, Zumi, Your Highness,
meet your spirit guides!

10:06.667 --> 10:07.625
Where are the spirits?

10:07.708 --> 10:08.667
What are they doing?

10:13.042 --> 10:17.292
Zumi, meet your spirit guides!

10:18.292 --> 10:21.125
Hello? Spirit guides!

10:21.625 --> 10:24.125
Hey, you two, get out here!

10:33.792 --> 10:38.625
If Ainbo is calling the spirit guides,
they must have appeared to her.

10:38.917 --> 10:40.792
She wouldn't make it up.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.750
Ainbo, wait!

10:53.000 --> 10:58.458
Zumi, you can't run away, you
have to stay with your people.

11:23.125 --> 11:24.792
-Hey, there you are!
-Who?

11:24.917 --> 11:26.708
Turn around!

11:27.500 --> 11:30.083
There you are! We've
been looking for you.

11:30.292 --> 11:32.500
You found me. And you better talk fast.

11:32.708 --> 11:35.083
-Or you're going to be sorry.
-Talk about what?

11:35.250 --> 11:37.917
You embarrassed me in
front of the entire village!

11:38.125 --> 11:40.750
Ooh, see, now we can explain that.

11:40.917 --> 11:41.875
Then do it!

11:42.750 --> 11:43.917
Hmm, no, we can't.

11:44.042 --> 11:45.833
It might be bad for our health?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.625
I thought you two
were immortal. Almighty.

11:48.833 --> 11:53.125
Us? No one is immortal
when it comes to Yacuruna.

11:54.125 --> 11:55.375
Jungle demon?

11:55.500 --> 11:58.250
Do you know another Yacuruna?

11:58.417 --> 12:00.500
No, and I never want to.

12:00.708 --> 12:01.875
But there is hope

12:02.125 --> 12:03.125
Hope for what?

12:03.250 --> 12:06.083
Hope to end Yacuruna's curse forever.

12:06.167 --> 12:09.417
-You see, there is this root...
-Deep in the jungle.

12:09.667 --> 12:10.583
How deep?

12:12.667 --> 12:13.833
About...

12:14.000 --> 12:15.125
We don't know.

12:15.292 --> 12:18.042
But this root will cure your village

12:18.250 --> 12:20.125
You mean end the curse?

12:20.458 --> 12:22.917
-Is that what we mean?
-Yeah sure.

12:23.208 --> 12:25.125
Do you at least know
what the root looks like?

12:26.375 --> 12:28.250
It's kind of...

12:30.292 --> 12:32.375
Hey, where are you going?

12:32.542 --> 12:35.875
Zumi was right; I'm a bad
friend for not being with her.

12:36.125 --> 12:41.542
We might not know where the root
is, but we know someone who does!

12:41.833 --> 12:44.000
-She can help you.
-Who?

12:44.167 --> 12:47.542
-Motelo Mama
-The giant turtle.

12:47.750 --> 12:50.833
Who carries the weight
of the world on her shell.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.292
I know who Motelo Mama is.

12:54.917 --> 12:58.125
-Are you saying she's real too?
-Uh huh.

12:58.417 --> 12:59.875
Okay...

13:03.375 --> 13:04.917
I need to talk to Zumi.

13:07.167 --> 13:08.917
You want to leave Candamo?

13:09.167 --> 13:12.625
How can you abandon me? And
at a time when I need you most?

13:12.792 --> 13:16.708
But I'm not abandoning you. I'm
doing something to save the village.

13:17.042 --> 13:18.167
Save your father.

13:18.333 --> 13:20.250
Ainbo, if there is such a root

13:20.333 --> 13:22.042
Don't you think our
shamans would have found it?

13:22.167 --> 13:23.542
They don't have spirit guides

13:24.125 --> 13:25.708
Ugh, your spirits. Again!

13:26.042 --> 13:29.125
Where are they, Ainbo? Why
aren't they helping Candamo?

13:29.250 --> 13:30.750
They are trying to

13:30.917 --> 13:33.625
This is their way; By
helping me find the root.

13:34.042 --> 13:35.917
Come with me and I'll show them to you.

13:36.125 --> 13:39.750
I'm sorry, Ainbo, I forbid
you to leave Candamo.

13:40.042 --> 13:41.750
-But...
-Forbid!

13:46.792 --> 13:50.667
Zumi just wants you
to be safe, that's all.

13:50.875 --> 13:52.917
Why won't Zumi believe me?

13:53.083 --> 13:55.417
Zumi doesn't see the world as you do.

13:55.625 --> 13:57.917
You are a very special person

13:58.292 --> 14:00.125
I don't feel special

14:00.542 --> 14:03.708
There are important things
you need to know, Ainbo.

14:04.333 --> 14:07.458
I raised you like you were my own child

14:07.833 --> 14:11.500
But it's time you know the
truth about Lizeni, your mother

14:12.417 --> 14:15.042
-Come.
-That's all I ever wanted to know.

14:17.042 --> 14:19.750
It was no coincidence I found you.

14:19.917 --> 14:23.750
In a dream, your mother told
me exactly where you'd be.

14:24.167 --> 14:27.125
Under that tree that you love so much

14:27.375 --> 14:30.000
I promised her I would look after you.

14:30.333 --> 14:34.125
-And you have.
-You two are very much alike.

14:34.458 --> 14:39.250
She was the most beautiful and
gifted hunter in all of Candamo.

14:39.667 --> 14:42.917
She could also see the spirit world

14:43.333 --> 14:44.167
What?

14:44.375 --> 14:47.500
I promised her that I would tell you her
story

14:47.583 --> 14:50.125
only if you were called by the spirits.

14:50.417 --> 14:55.042
They called me but...
they're kind of... well... loopy.

14:55.792 --> 14:58.083
Not loopy. Tricksters!

14:58.250 --> 15:00.833
Some guides work like this too

15:01.000 --> 15:01.833
Why?

15:01.917 --> 15:05.625
If I tell you everything
and show you everything

15:05.917 --> 15:08.500
then what will you learn for yourself?

15:10.167 --> 15:12.500
I'll learn how to save the village?

15:12.708 --> 15:16.625
But it is you who has to
save the village, not them

15:17.042 --> 15:18.917
I still don't understand

15:19.083 --> 15:21.125
You need to sleep now

15:21.458 --> 15:25.125
Tomorrow morning I'll tell
you more about your mother

15:25.708 --> 15:27.500
I love you mama Chuni.

15:27.833 --> 15:29.375
I love you too

16:21.083 --> 16:22.917
Zumi, wake up, wake up!

16:25.208 --> 16:27.000
Not now, Ainbo.

16:29.833 --> 16:33.667
I'm asking for one favor, all you
have to do is come talk to Chuni.

16:33.958 --> 16:35.000
Why?

16:36.500 --> 16:38.625
Just listen to what she has to say

16:38.875 --> 16:41.625
She'll tell you everything
you need to know about me

16:41.875 --> 16:44.000
And my mother and the spirits!

16:44.125 --> 16:44.958
Ainbo!

16:45.125 --> 16:48.125
Please Zumi, just listen to Chuni says

16:48.292 --> 16:51.541
and after that if you still
forbid me to leave, fine!

16:53.083 --> 16:55.791
-Alright -Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

17:04.165 --> 17:07.250
Chuni, I brought Zumi to
hear the story of my mother.

17:12.290 --> 17:13.375
Mom?

17:14.333 --> 17:15.791
Chuni?

17:17.875 --> 17:20.500
Chuni, please don't leave me

17:22.208 --> 17:23.458
What happened?

17:24.125 --> 17:25.291
Get out

17:39.583 --> 17:40.833
This was no accident.

17:43.167 --> 17:44.375
The curse killed her.

17:44.625 --> 17:45.625
This is your fault!

17:45.750 --> 17:46.875
-No
-Yes!

17:47.000 --> 17:49.125
You and your spirits
are the ones to blame

17:49.208 --> 17:52.792
That's crazy. <i>You</i>'re
crazy! My spirits are good.

17:53.083 --> 17:55.000
You believe me, right Zumi?

18:00.250 --> 18:01.292
Ainbo!

18:01.625 --> 18:04.333
If she isn't guilty, why
would she run away?

18:04.500 --> 18:07.375
Maybe she's just afraid
of you. I know <i>I</i> am.

18:07.458 --> 18:11.208
I may frighten you, but I keep
the evil spirits out of Candamo.

18:11.417 --> 18:13.417
I guess you were off-duty last night.

18:13.625 --> 18:16.167
I can stop the evil spirits
from entering the village

18:16.375 --> 18:19.000
But I cannot stop the evil
that has already been let in.

18:19.292 --> 18:20.500
I don't know what you mean

18:20.708 --> 18:21.750
Yes you do.

18:21.833 --> 18:24.208
You know that Ainbo was
the last one to be with Chuni.

18:24.333 --> 18:26.708
They shared that hut
since Ainbo was a baby.

18:26.833 --> 18:28.250
A baby born of evil

18:28.458 --> 18:31.042
Love must have blinded Chuni until now

18:31.208 --> 18:33.250
-So Ainbo is...
-My father would have told me

18:33.458 --> 18:36.167
He would not have let Ainbo
and I become best friends.

18:36.292 --> 18:37.792
Huarinka was blind too

18:37.917 --> 18:40.333
That is why a child
like you leads us today.

18:40.750 --> 18:43.458
I might be a child but I'm not stupid

18:43.708 --> 18:46.000
And how dare you speak
of my father that way?

18:46.125 --> 18:49.792
You have the power to bring health
and happiness back to the village

18:50.042 --> 18:52.250
-And you make your father proud.
-How?

18:52.417 --> 18:55.375
Allow me to go after
Ainbo and confront her evil

18:55.542 --> 18:58.792
-Allow me to lift the curse
-I won't let you do that

18:59.125 --> 19:02.667
Zumi, you are our leader now
whether you want to be or not

19:02.792 --> 19:05.292
Consider the fate of
one against the fate of all

19:05.500 --> 19:07.292
Let me lift the weight off your shoulders

19:07.542 --> 19:11.000
-My answer is no. Ainbo...
-Ainbo is the curse!

19:11.458 --> 19:13.833
-I'm going to find her
-I said, no.

19:13.917 --> 19:15.542
How will you stop me?

19:15.750 --> 19:18.167
Do you think any of my
warriors will do your bidding?

19:18.458 --> 19:20.833
One day soon, you'll
thank me Your Highness.

19:20.917 --> 19:22.042
Atok!

19:36.833 --> 19:40.333
Now I've lost Chuni, and I'll
never know about my mother.

19:41.208 --> 19:44.917
Zumi thinks... I don't know
what she thinks. Ouch!

19:46.208 --> 19:47.750
No you don't.

19:49.042 --> 19:52.208
Why are you so far away
from the river, little turtle?

19:52.542 --> 19:53.917
But...

19:54.125 --> 19:56.792
You're trying to tell me
something, aren't you?

19:58.917 --> 20:00.250
Ouch!

20:01.500 --> 20:03.500
You are a sign, right?

20:04.125 --> 20:06.125
A sign from Motelo Mama!

20:08.833 --> 20:11.625
Let's go find Motelo
Mama. Thanks little turtle.

20:13.250 --> 20:15.333
It's me and the jungle now.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.833
Spirit guides!

20:20.292 --> 20:22.917
Dillo! Vaca!

20:23.125 --> 20:25.625
Can you please appear again?

20:27.542 --> 20:31.167
Great, I have no idea how
to call them if I need their help

20:32.125 --> 20:34.167
And I'm starving.

20:38.250 --> 20:39.417
Guaba!

20:56.333 --> 20:58.750
I'm not greedy. We can share.

21:05.083 --> 21:06.792
Here, do you want some?

21:08.792 --> 21:11.542
You know it's not polite to stare, right?

21:28.625 --> 21:32.667
Let me go! I said I'd share with you!

21:35.083 --> 21:36.708
Hold on!

21:38.083 --> 21:40.333
-Not my nose!
-No!

21:40.542 --> 21:42.583
No!

21:49.833 --> 21:51.208
What happened?

21:51.417 --> 21:53.292
You two were very brave.

21:53.917 --> 21:55.708
Thank you for saving me

21:56.000 --> 21:57.417
I wish I...

21:58.667 --> 22:00.125
What is wrong?

22:00.667 --> 22:03.333
I wish I could tell Chuni, but...

22:03.917 --> 22:05.792
she's gone...

22:06.500 --> 22:07.875
Gone?

22:08.125 --> 22:09.875
Do you mean...?

22:10.125 --> 22:11.042
Yes.

22:19.917 --> 22:24.667
"Goodbye forever, Mama"

22:25.125 --> 22:27.042
Chant with us, Ainbo.

22:27.708 --> 22:32.875
Let's make sure Chuni's spirit
travels to the next world safely.

22:35.125 --> 22:39.125
-"Goodbye forever, mom"
-"Goodbye forever, mom"

22:39.292 --> 22:42.625
"Goodbye forever, Mama"

22:43.458 --> 22:48.250
-"Goodbye forever, mom"
-"Goodbye forever, mom"

23:00.500 --> 23:01.792
Where is Atok?

23:02.125 --> 23:05.208
Connie hated him
it's better he's not here

23:05.875 --> 23:10.375
Now it's your job to send
Connie to the spirit world

23:10.750 --> 23:11.667
go

23:17.917 --> 23:19.375
Goodbye Mama? Connie)

23:19.750 --> 23:20.583
I love you

23:21.292 --> 23:23.042
take care of me please

23:27.083 --> 23:32.167
"Goodbye forever, Mama"

23:34.625 --> 23:40.042
"Goodbye forever, Mama"

23:41.917 --> 23:47.375
"Goodbye forever, Mama"

24:07.042 --> 24:08.875
I knew I'd find you

24:15.333 --> 24:16.500
What's wrong?

24:17.333 --> 24:18.542
It's Ainbo

24:18.792 --> 24:20.208
She'll come back

24:20.417 --> 24:21.917
No, she won't.

24:22.125 --> 24:24.375
Atok's going after her.

24:28.500 --> 24:29.917
To... what?

24:39.042 --> 24:41.458
Atok said Ainbo was
the cause of the curse

24:41.542 --> 24:44.417
and Candamo would
return to prosperity if he...

24:44.708 --> 24:46.333
He's gone after Ainbo?

24:46.500 --> 24:49.375
I told him "No", but he just ignored me

24:49.875 --> 24:53.500
My first command, and he
treated me like I'm some little child!

24:53.708 --> 24:55.208
Zumi, listen to me

24:55.375 --> 24:59.125
Take two of our men and
find Atok before it's too late

24:59.542 --> 25:01.667
But Atok said no warriors would join me

25:01.833 --> 25:04.917
Ridiculous! You are their leader now

25:05.083 --> 25:07.833
So now is the time to lead

25:08.458 --> 25:10.458
bring Ainbo home.

25:13.542 --> 25:15.000
She is a day ahead of us

25:15.208 --> 25:18.542
And if we don't pick up a trail, we
don't even know which way to go.

25:19.708 --> 25:22.167
We have to find her. And fast.

25:23.917 --> 25:25.125
Ready?

25:31.917 --> 25:35.667
-Wait! We forgot something.
-What?

25:35.792 --> 25:36.917
What did we forget?

25:38.042 --> 25:39.083
Breakfast.

25:40.625 --> 25:41.625
See the fruits?

25:42.083 --> 25:43.625
Up there, shoot them.

25:44.833 --> 25:47.208
Yummy, yummy. Get them down!

25:48.000 --> 25:49.542
Where are my arrows?

25:49.792 --> 25:51.333
You lost your arrows?

25:52.500 --> 25:53.875
That's alright.

25:54.167 --> 25:55.875
Here. Try this.

25:56.125 --> 25:57.750
-This?
-Yup!

25:59.833 --> 26:01.375
Concentrate...

26:01.792 --> 26:04.917
Aim... And steady.

26:10.750 --> 26:11.583
No good

26:11.667 --> 26:14.292
Because you gave me a reed instead of
an arrow

26:14.458 --> 26:17.375
Reed, arrow, all the same!

26:17.500 --> 26:18.917
Just watch

26:20.875 --> 26:22.708
-Bull's eye!
-And a few more

26:23.083 --> 26:24.750
Whoosh!

26:28.125 --> 26:30.250
There's my breakfast

26:31.125 --> 26:36.500
Ladies and gentlemen, the
best archer in all the Amazon!

26:36.875 --> 26:39.250
-Dillo!
-Great! I'm impressed.

26:39.625 --> 26:41.125
But you're a spirit.

26:41.250 --> 26:43.917
You don't have to be a spirit to do that

26:44.125 --> 26:46.667
You just need to believe in yourself

26:46.917 --> 26:49.708
Here. I got something that will help.

26:49.917 --> 26:53.125
Show her! Shooting a reed into a tree.

26:53.333 --> 26:56.333
-That is just a test.
-And you flunked.

26:57.208 --> 26:58.292
Got it!

26:58.458 --> 27:00.708
A gift from your spirit guides

27:00.833 --> 27:02.708
We made it ourselves

27:02.917 --> 27:05.625
You made this? How? When?

27:05.792 --> 27:07.542
Spirit guide secret!

27:07.750 --> 27:09.125
It's so beautiful

27:09.542 --> 27:11.125
I might never want to shoot it.

27:11.292 --> 27:12.792
Or you might!

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Time will tell.

27:14.125 --> 27:15.667
It is better I keep it.

27:15.875 --> 27:18.417
It will still be there when you need it

27:18.792 --> 27:23.042
So. Now I need to find Motelo
Mama, get the root and save Candamo.

27:23.125 --> 27:25.208
-Exactly
-In that order

27:25.333 --> 27:28.208
Now it's quest time.

27:30.708 --> 27:35.375
Actually, I don't know where
to go. Can you help me?

27:36.667 --> 27:37.875
One moment

27:43.833 --> 27:45.042
What was the question?

27:45.208 --> 27:47.083
Can you help me?

27:47.250 --> 27:48.917
-Yes!
-No.

27:49.167 --> 27:50.917
-Yes <i>and</i> no!

27:51.125 --> 27:53.833
-Sometimes we can help
-And sometimes we can't

27:53.917 --> 27:55.417
Crazy, isn't it?

27:55.708 --> 27:57.667
How am I supposed to
know when you can help?

27:57.833 --> 27:59.042
You aren't supposed to know.

27:59.167 --> 28:01.083
Spirit guide secret!

28:01.208 --> 28:02.542
Again!

28:02.708 --> 28:05.167
I told Chuni that you are sort of...

28:05.625 --> 28:08.792
Well, sorry, I told her you were loopy.

28:09.083 --> 28:13.083
But she said if you helped me do
everything, it wouldn't be <i>my</i> quest.

28:13.167 --> 28:16.833
-Smart woman that Chuni.
-I will treat her in the spirit world

28:17.042 --> 28:19.125
But right now, I'm lost.

28:19.375 --> 28:21.708
I have no idea where the great river is

28:22.125 --> 28:23.250
Can you help me?

28:23.667 --> 28:25.583
The answer is...

28:25.958 --> 28:26.792
Yes!

28:26.875 --> 28:30.375
Climb on up. We'll cover
much more ground this way.

28:36.542 --> 28:39.625
Wow! The Amazon is amazing.

28:39.750 --> 28:41.917
So much more than just Candamo.

28:42.042 --> 28:44.167
Candamo is part of the Amazon.

28:44.333 --> 28:46.000
It is all one.

29:15.833 --> 29:17.417
Why did we stop?

29:19.917 --> 29:21.292
Are we there?

29:24.625 --> 29:26.250
What do you think it is?

29:26.417 --> 29:29.667
It's a place to stay away from

29:29.917 --> 29:31.042
Far away

29:31.125 --> 29:33.750
We think it belongs to the Yacuruna.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.042
Then why is it calling out to me?

29:37.083 --> 29:38.250
Ah, what are you doing?

29:39.000 --> 29:40.167
Ainbo!

29:40.917 --> 29:42.542
We should go after her.

29:42.792 --> 29:44.208
Sure, yes, we should!

29:45.083 --> 29:46.167
You go first

29:50.417 --> 29:52.083
It's the Yacuruna!

30:52.375 --> 30:53.792
What are you doing here?

30:53.917 --> 30:55.375
We never come here

30:55.542 --> 30:58.417
But sometimes you gotta change your mind

31:41.625 --> 31:43.542
Why did they stop at the river?

31:43.875 --> 31:46.125
They are afraid of something

31:46.417 --> 31:48.208
-Water?
-Yeah sure

31:48.875 --> 31:51.917
Next time all we have
to do is squirt them.

31:52.083 --> 31:53.625
You don't have to be mean

31:53.917 --> 31:56.208
Maybe it's something
that <i>lives</i> in the river.

31:57.625 --> 31:58.458
Maybe.

31:58.625 --> 32:01.125
Now, what lives in the river?

32:02.500 --> 32:04.292
Motelo Mama!

32:08.917 --> 32:11.625
Guys, do you think Motelo Mama is nearby?

32:12.375 --> 32:14.042
It's a big river

32:14.250 --> 32:17.167
Alright, I get it, it's <i>my</i> quest.

32:17.500 --> 32:20.042
The moon is full, I'm going now

32:20.125 --> 32:22.125
Stay close to the river bank

32:22.292 --> 32:25.292
-We will see you later
-I hope so

33:13.208 --> 33:16.083
You gotta be more
careful with your arrows.

33:16.417 --> 33:17.792
I knew it was you

33:18.000 --> 33:22.125
-When Zumi finds out...
-Zumi sent me to end the curse

33:22.542 --> 33:23.750
That's a lie

33:24.417 --> 33:26.750
She... she wouldn't..

33:26.917 --> 33:28.708
I'm going to untie you now

33:28.833 --> 33:31.708
and I'm hoping you'll try to run away.

33:33.792 --> 33:37.875
Seems like only yesterday, I
went hunting with a young woman.

33:39.458 --> 33:42.917
She was the fastest
runner, the best hunter

33:43.125 --> 33:45.750
And knew the jungle like no one else.

33:48.208 --> 33:50.208
You're talking about <i>my</i> mother

33:51.500 --> 33:52.792
Lizeni.

33:52.917 --> 33:54.500
You know about your mother?

33:54.833 --> 33:57.125
You'd be surprised by everything I know

33:58.458 --> 34:00.542
Not one more step, Atok.

34:02.250 --> 34:04.042
Go ahead, shoot me!

34:04.208 --> 34:05.500
You don't think I will?

34:05.667 --> 34:07.625
I don't think you can.

34:38.000 --> 34:42.708
I was so much in love with your
mother, but she chose another!

34:43.083 --> 34:43.917
Who was he?

34:44.125 --> 34:46.542
All that matters now is the curse

34:46.708 --> 34:49.750
And the curse ends here and now

36:01.500 --> 36:03.500
Are you the turtle that bit me?

36:05.125 --> 36:07.875
Hey, wait! Where are you going?

37:00.542 --> 37:02.125
Hey, turtles!

38:01.833 --> 38:03.167
Motelo Mama!

38:04.708 --> 38:07.042
Motelo Mama!

38:11.917 --> 38:16.083
Please, it's Ainbo.
I'm Lizeni's daughter.

38:19.750 --> 38:22.167
Hello Ainbo.

38:22.708 --> 38:24.333
I thought I'd never find you

38:24.500 --> 38:27.542
You look so much like your mother

38:28.042 --> 38:31.917
Everyone in the world seems
to know my mother, except me...

38:32.125 --> 38:33.625
Not true.

38:33.917 --> 38:37.167
You know her better than anyone.

38:37.750 --> 38:38.750
How?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.917
Tell me about your favorite tree

38:42.208 --> 38:44.000
You know about my tree?

38:45.125 --> 38:47.458
Oh you would know you're Motelo Mama.

38:47.833 --> 38:50.875
That's right, so tell me

38:52.042 --> 38:54.417
I found the tree when I was a little girl

38:54.917 --> 38:57.542
I felt I could tell it all my secrets

38:57.792 --> 39:00.792
Things you could only tell your mother.

39:00.917 --> 39:03.667
That's right! Things I would only tell...

39:04.500 --> 39:06.125
But it's a tree

39:06.292 --> 39:07.917
Just a tree?

39:08.875 --> 39:11.792
Everyone thought I was
crazy for talking to a tree

39:12.417 --> 39:15.125
But I think my mother's
spirit lives in that tree

39:15.917 --> 39:21.500
And the root of your mother's
tree is the root you are seeking.

39:24.292 --> 39:26.083
What is it, Ainbo?

39:26.375 --> 39:31.750
I'm afraid. I'm afraid of the
jungle. I'm afraid of the Yacuruna.

39:32.167 --> 39:35.792
I'm afraid I'm just a scared child,
who can't even shoot an arrow.

39:36.042 --> 39:38.125
The jungle needs you, not me

39:38.792 --> 39:41.292
I'm afraid too, Ainbo.

39:41.750 --> 39:44.083
No! You're Motelo Mama.

39:44.625 --> 39:51.625
For thousands of years, the bond
between my children and I was perfect

39:52.458 --> 39:57.167
Then the Yacuruna
infected all of my children

39:57.458 --> 40:02.333
They stopped believing
in the spirits. In the jungle.

40:03.625 --> 40:08.125
Now I'm afraid that it may be too late

40:08.708 --> 40:10.208
There is no hope?

40:10.458 --> 40:12.833
You are the hope, Ainbo.

40:13.750 --> 40:14.583
Yes

40:14.667 --> 40:20.375
You're a scared child! But
you're also much, much more.

40:21.083 --> 40:23.125
I wish I could believe that

40:23.292 --> 40:24.875
You will!

40:25.500 --> 40:28.625
Your mother's tree is sacred

40:28.917 --> 40:33.917
It's roots hold the power to
change even the darkest heart.

40:34.292 --> 40:40.250
So they must be cut with a
sacred blade made from moonrock.

40:40.500 --> 40:42.667
Now I have to go to the Moon?

40:43.833 --> 40:45.458
No, Ainbo

40:45.833 --> 40:47.542
Climb onto me.

40:58.750 --> 41:04.625
You must go to the Volcano
of the Moon. It's up ahead.

41:06.667 --> 41:09.167
Find Pelejo, the sloth.

41:09.500 --> 41:14.625
Be careful how you speak
to him, he's... a grouch.

41:14.917 --> 41:16.667
Bring him a gift

41:16.917 --> 41:18.375
something sweet

41:18.875 --> 41:19.833
Then what?

41:20.125 --> 41:23.542
One step at a time, Ainbo.

41:51.750 --> 41:53.500
I believe you dropped this

41:54.542 --> 41:56.750
Who are you?

42:04.500 --> 42:08.125
I'm so tired

42:14.000 --> 42:15.208
Tada!!

42:15.333 --> 42:16.417
It's about time!

42:16.625 --> 42:18.792
Do you always have
to come out of nowhere?

42:18.917 --> 42:21.917
-If we came out of somewhere...
-We'd already be there.

42:22.375 --> 42:23.917
Forget I asked

42:24.167 --> 42:28.417
So. Isn't Motelo Mama the
most amazing giant turtle..

42:28.625 --> 42:31.792
...who carries the world on
her shell, that you ever met?

42:31.917 --> 42:33.125
You know I met her

42:33.292 --> 42:36.333
-We know everything
-Except, when we don't.

42:36.500 --> 42:41.208
We know you have to bring
Pelejo the sloth, something sweet.

42:41.333 --> 42:44.625
So, here is your sweet leaf tree.

42:45.250 --> 42:48.333
Perfect, thank you. I'll
break off some branches.

42:48.708 --> 42:50.042
Branches?

42:50.417 --> 42:52.792
This is Pelejo you'r bribing.

42:52.917 --> 42:54.708
What do you mean, bribing?

42:54.917 --> 42:58.917
-He's got a bad temper
-You've gotta get him on your side.

42:59.125 --> 43:00.667
You don't want him to step on you

43:00.833 --> 43:03.458
Step on me? How big is this Pelejo?

43:03.667 --> 43:06.125
Oooh, he's about...

43:09.667 --> 43:11.000
He's a giant

43:11.083 --> 43:13.917
That's why you've gotta take him the
whole tree.

43:16.250 --> 43:17.708
Impossible!

43:17.875 --> 43:18.917
No

43:19.083 --> 43:20.333
No?

43:41.833 --> 43:44.167
So, take the tree up to Pelejo.

43:44.333 --> 43:47.083
-Get the sacred moonrock
-Don't get stepped on

43:47.167 --> 43:48.917
And most important

43:49.333 --> 43:51.125
We'll... wait right here.

43:51.292 --> 43:54.042
Cheering you on, every step of the way

43:54.167 --> 43:56.167
Are you crazy?

43:56.542 --> 43:59.042
I can't take the tree
up there all by myself.

43:59.833 --> 44:02.667
Didn't Motelo Mama
command you to help me?

44:05.042 --> 44:06.667
Yes...

44:06.792 --> 44:08.250
But we don't want to go up there.

44:08.333 --> 44:10.042
We're scared of heights

44:10.167 --> 44:13.667
-And uh, getting stepped on!
-Stop whining!

44:13.792 --> 44:15.917
If I'm going, you're going.

44:16.125 --> 44:19.458
Or I'm telling Motelo
Mama that you're cowards

44:19.958 --> 44:20.833
Don't do that

44:20.917 --> 44:22.125
We'll go

44:22.500 --> 44:24.667
Okay, it is time for us to be brave

44:24.792 --> 44:26.667
Yeah! Brave!

44:35.917 --> 44:38.667
-Wait, stop!
-What now?

44:38.792 --> 44:41.417
I didn't know it was so steep

44:41.625 --> 44:43.708
-Vaca!
-We can't do this

44:43.875 --> 44:45.292
Oh yes, we can

44:45.458 --> 44:47.458
We just have to work really hard

44:47.750 --> 44:48.792
Heave!

44:48.875 --> 44:49.875
Ho!

44:49.958 --> 44:50.958
Heave!

44:51.042 --> 44:52.042
Ho!

44:52.250 --> 44:53.125
Heave!

44:53.208 --> 44:54.208
Ho!

44:55.875 --> 44:58.250
That's it. I've gotta rest.

44:58.375 --> 45:00.000
Ho!

45:02.750 --> 45:04.875
Come on! We have to go to the peak!

45:05.083 --> 45:07.125
No time to rest

45:07.250 --> 45:10.083
Dillo! Hold on!

45:12.542 --> 45:14.167
This is the end of me.

45:14.292 --> 45:16.875
Motelo Mama!

45:22.000 --> 45:23.750
Dillo!

45:25.875 --> 45:27.625
Vaca, no!

45:32.917 --> 45:34.875
Are we close to the top?

45:40.917 --> 45:42.125
What happened? I don't know

45:42.292 --> 45:44.125
Have you ever seen anything like this?

45:56.250 --> 45:57.542
It could be dangerous

45:57.708 --> 45:59.125
Of course it could.

45:59.625 --> 46:01.125
Now follow me.

46:11.083 --> 46:13.125
-Zumi!
-Did you find Ainbo?

46:13.542 --> 46:15.083
I found her tracks.

46:15.167 --> 46:16.792
She is still a day ahead of us.

46:17.458 --> 46:19.917
But perhaps she's not
so important anymore.

46:20.125 --> 46:26.042
She's important to me. And you are
never to disobey any of my commands again!

46:26.167 --> 46:27.458
I understand

46:28.833 --> 46:30.750
Please, join us by the fire.

46:33.250 --> 46:37.167
Zumi, I'd like you to meet the
honorable Mr. Cornelis DeWitt

46:37.375 --> 46:38.833
It's an honor to meet you

46:39.500 --> 46:43.750
-Likewise, I've never met a...
-A white man?

46:46.708 --> 46:49.875
What a beautiful necklace you have!

46:53.125 --> 46:55.167
I will explain to you what I mean

46:56.083 --> 46:57.250
Bring me the expert

46:57.542 --> 46:59.708
What brings you to
the jungle, Mr. DeWitt?

46:59.875 --> 47:02.125
I am a scientist. A bonanist.

47:02.333 --> 47:03.667
What is that?

47:03.792 --> 47:08.167
I study rare plants to see which
ones might make powerful medicine.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.667
-You're a shaman?
-Yes, you can say that

47:12.000 --> 47:13.917
Look, this one treats malaria

47:14.333 --> 47:17.125
-Malaria?
-The disease the bloodsuckers bring.

47:17.708 --> 47:19.750
It's killed many of our elders.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.917
Because you don't have the right medicine

47:22.375 --> 47:24.458
And this one is for yellow fever

47:24.667 --> 47:27.208
Untreated, that's almost always fatal.

47:27.542 --> 47:31.083
Mr. DeWitt says this could be
the sickness that is killing Huarinka.

47:31.208 --> 47:33.542
No, it's the curse
that is killing my father

47:33.750 --> 47:36.500
But what if these diseases
are part of the curse?

47:37.042 --> 47:38.792
I'm not sure I understand

47:39.042 --> 47:40.708
You see, Zumi, where I
come from,

47:40.792 --> 47:44.125
we have perfected the cure for many
diseases with our medicines.

47:44.542 --> 47:46.000
They're truly miracles

47:46.250 --> 47:48.917
-And it could save my father?
-I believe so

47:49.292 --> 47:51.292
Then come to my village. To Candamo.

47:51.458 --> 47:53.667
Please, we don't have time to lose

47:53.917 --> 47:54.917
I understand

47:55.167 --> 47:58.167
But, Mr. DeWitt, explain one thing

47:58.542 --> 48:01.208
You are a white man.
A stranger to our jungle

48:01.792 --> 48:04.250
Why help us? What do you want?

48:05.125 --> 48:07.042
At heart, I am a healer

48:07.250 --> 48:09.167
But if you want me to want something...

48:09.750 --> 48:11.833
Yes, go on

48:12.125 --> 48:15.208
Show me where you got the
gold to make that beautiful necklace

48:16.625 --> 48:17.708
Is this your only request?

48:17.833 --> 48:18.958
If you heal my father,

48:19.042 --> 48:22.667
I can show you where to dig gold out of
the ground with your bare hands.

48:22.833 --> 48:26.167
Now come, back to
Candamo, light the torches

48:26.625 --> 48:29.125
Forget your torches. I've got this.

48:31.500 --> 48:32.500
Heave!

48:32.958 --> 48:33.958
Ho!

48:34.125 --> 48:35.167
Heave!

48:35.250 --> 48:36.250
Ho!

48:36.500 --> 48:37.792
Heave!

48:37.875 --> 48:38.875
Ho...

48:43.500 --> 48:45.708
Is anyone thinking what I'm thinking?

48:46.625 --> 48:49.042
This volcano is stinky

48:50.375 --> 48:51.667
Ouch!

48:51.875 --> 48:57.125
I don't know much about volcanoes
but why is the ground so warm here?

49:10.792 --> 49:12.042
Who are you?

49:12.250 --> 49:14.625
Let me have a closer look.

49:19.625 --> 49:21.708
I'm Ainbo of Candamo.

49:22.125 --> 49:24.625
Never heard of it. Or you.

49:26.042 --> 49:27.500
Who are they?

49:27.750 --> 49:29.167
Who do you think they are?

49:29.458 --> 49:35.917
From up here I think they are
very small sloths, or very large ants.

49:37.083 --> 49:40.208
They are Vaca and Dillo, spirit guides.

49:42.750 --> 49:45.125
Those two are spirit guides?

49:46.125 --> 49:47.667
Right, I know

49:47.917 --> 49:51.375
But what you don't know is
that Motelo Mama sent them

49:51.708 --> 49:52.917
and me!

49:56.625 --> 50:00.167
How do I know Motelo Mama sent you?

50:01.042 --> 50:02.667
How do you know she didn't?

50:03.042 --> 50:04.375
She sent me to get a moonrock.

50:04.625 --> 50:06.292
And if I come back without one.

50:06.625 --> 50:09.417
Well I wouldn't want
to be the one to blame.

50:10.000 --> 50:14.417
It is true that you don't want to
be on Motelo Mama's bad side.

50:14.625 --> 50:17.333
So do you have moonrock?

50:17.667 --> 50:19.750
Of course, tons of it

50:19.917 --> 50:21.833
Just at the top of the peak

50:22.042 --> 50:24.250
Take as much as you want

50:24.542 --> 50:27.125
There's no way I can get up there

50:27.458 --> 50:28.667
I need your help

50:30.333 --> 50:35.042
I haven't helped anyone for a
hundred years. Why should I start now?

50:35.833 --> 50:39.542
You're a very frustrating
sloth but I'll tell you why

50:39.875 --> 50:42.125
-Look
-Look at what?

50:42.292 --> 50:43.833
Those two idiots?

50:44.042 --> 50:45.292
They're not idiots.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.125
Not all the time

50:49.500 --> 50:50.875
Look at the tree

50:53.500 --> 50:55.208
Is this what I think it is?

50:55.333 --> 50:59.042
A whole sweet leaf tree just for you

50:59.167 --> 51:00.292
For me?

51:00.417 --> 51:02.292
If I get my moonrock

51:02.458 --> 51:07.750
I can't remember the last
time I tasted anything sweet

51:08.042 --> 51:10.833
And after all, Motelo Mama sent you

51:19.417 --> 51:21.542
Here. A moonrock!

51:21.917 --> 51:23.083
Thank you

51:24.083 --> 51:25.917
Do you know how I carve it into a knife?

51:26.292 --> 51:27.458
You!

51:27.708 --> 51:28.875
You can't!

51:29.375 --> 51:31.792
<i>I</i> can. Give it to me.

51:38.917 --> 51:40.875
That can't be good for your teeth.

51:43.250 --> 51:44.500
Here

51:45.667 --> 51:47.125
It's perfect.

51:47.292 --> 51:49.000
Of course it is

51:49.208 --> 51:51.833
And now, sweet leaves

51:58.417 --> 52:01.375
You are a hungry one, aren't you big guy?

52:01.500 --> 52:07.125
I can't see anything around here I
would like to eat. Just rocks and dust.

52:07.417 --> 52:09.000
No wonder he's moody

52:10.667 --> 52:12.667
Now you need to go

52:13.917 --> 52:16.792
I'm sorry, we didn't mean to be rude

52:17.917 --> 52:19.208
That's not it.

52:23.125 --> 52:24.458
That's it!

52:31.167 --> 52:33.708
We need to escape. And fast!

52:35.667 --> 52:36.917
But how?

52:41.292 --> 52:44.250
-We fly. With his fan
-With his fan?

52:45.167 --> 52:47.125
Spirit guide magic

52:49.375 --> 52:50.875
Hey! Can we please borrow your fan?

52:52.458 --> 52:54.708
Will you bring me
another sweet leaf tree?

52:54.875 --> 52:58.917
If we get off this volcano, I'll
bring you ten sweet leaf trees.

52:59.750 --> 53:01.125
Then hurry.

53:15.375 --> 53:16.750
Ready to fly?

53:16.875 --> 53:18.792
Have we got another choice?

53:19.125 --> 53:20.417
We can burn

53:23.042 --> 53:24.208
I will fly

53:24.333 --> 53:25.667
Then come on!

53:32.500 --> 53:34.083
Oh, I'm too fat.

53:34.208 --> 53:35.708
You go ahead

53:36.042 --> 53:38.083
We are not leaving you!

53:40.333 --> 53:43.125
Vaca!

53:53.833 --> 53:57.208
-Meet us at my mother's.
-Where?

53:57.333 --> 54:00.333
-My tree
-Your mother is a tree?

54:00.500 --> 54:04.125
Do you really expect
me to explain it now?

54:05.083 --> 54:08.667
If I live, I'm going on a diet.

54:21.917 --> 54:23.125
Nice

54:24.833 --> 54:26.375
And scary

54:39.125 --> 54:41.042
Stop! Not so fast!

54:41.292 --> 54:45.125
Where are the brakes?

54:45.875 --> 54:50.208
Ainbo! Dillo! Someone help me. Please!

54:53.542 --> 54:55.208
I'm not a bird

55:13.125 --> 55:16.125
Look there! It's Candamo.

55:16.375 --> 55:17.875
Hey guys

55:18.875 --> 55:20.917
If only Zumi could see me now.

55:26.667 --> 55:29.458
Coming in for a landing!

55:40.125 --> 55:42.167
We made it! We made it!

55:46.458 --> 55:49.625
-Heave, ho! Heave, ho!
-Vaca!

55:49.792 --> 55:53.208
Heave ho. Heave ho.

55:53.417 --> 55:55.750
There there. You're alright now.

55:55.875 --> 55:57.542
No more lava?

55:57.917 --> 56:00.042
-No.
-No more sloths?

56:00.167 --> 56:04.000
Everything is fine and you're
both the best spirit guides ever

56:04.750 --> 56:06.292
I got my moonrock dagger

56:06.833 --> 56:10.333
-Now I need to talk to my mother
-Okay

56:28.042 --> 56:28.917
Mother?

56:38.208 --> 56:39.042
Ainbo?

56:41.833 --> 56:42.667
Zumi?

56:46.917 --> 56:47.750
Zumi!

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
I never thought I'd see you again

56:50.125 --> 56:51.792
I never thought I'd see you

56:52.125 --> 56:54.917
-Ainbo, something happened.
-What is it?

56:55.083 --> 56:56.875
-My father, he is...
-Is he...?

56:57.125 --> 56:59.333
No, he's not dead, come see

57:03.167 --> 57:04.500
No need for that now

57:04.708 --> 57:08.083
Don't be worrued about Atok.
He will never try to hurt you again

57:08.250 --> 57:10.875
He knows he almost did a terrible thing

57:11.250 --> 57:13.417
It's not Atok, it's...

57:14.042 --> 57:15.583
I don't know what it is

57:15.833 --> 57:16.667
Come on

57:18.750 --> 57:20.250
Do you feel that?

57:20.375 --> 57:21.458
There is something wrong

57:21.542 --> 57:23.125
And we both know it

57:28.417 --> 57:29.250
Papa?

57:30.083 --> 57:33.083
Ainbo, thank the gods, come here

57:33.333 --> 57:36.042
-You look better
-I <i>am</i> better

57:37.042 --> 57:38.125
I'm not perfect

57:38.250 --> 57:40.917
But you will be thanks to a great shaman

57:41.125 --> 57:43.917
He's healing father.
And he'll heal the village!

57:44.083 --> 57:46.458
-Who is he?
-Am I interrupting?

57:53.500 --> 57:56.208
I want you to meet my best friend, Ainbo.

57:56.375 --> 57:57.542
Hello Ainbo

57:57.917 --> 58:01.375
Zumi's best friend! That
makes you very important

58:01.750 --> 58:03.000
I'm just a girl

58:03.167 --> 58:07.000
Please, I can already tell you
are much more than just a girl

58:07.208 --> 58:09.083
I... I...

58:13.458 --> 58:14.667
Ainbo!

58:18.625 --> 58:20.708
Ainbo! What's wrong?

58:20.917 --> 58:22.625
That man. He's dangerous

58:22.750 --> 58:25.000
That man saved my father's life!

58:25.125 --> 58:26.792
He's not a man

58:27.000 --> 58:30.750
He's Yacuruna disguised
as a man I've seen it!

58:31.458 --> 58:33.292
Yacuruna!

58:33.417 --> 58:36.625
The village thinks that <i>you</i> are
the curse. You know that, right?

58:36.833 --> 58:40.000
Atok said you sent him
to find me to end the curse

58:40.292 --> 58:43.625
-That's a lie.
-Did you send him after your best friend?

58:43.792 --> 58:45.042
I stopped him

58:46.000 --> 58:49.125
It doesn't matter now, that
demon is all that matters

58:49.708 --> 58:52.125
Spirits! Demons! I'm sick of it!

58:52.292 --> 58:55.833
You continue to talk like
this I'll banish you for good.

58:57.875 --> 58:59.125
Where are you going?

58:59.333 --> 59:02.042
You're right. I don't belong here

59:02.167 --> 59:05.667
If you leave, Ainbo, don't come back

59:31.000 --> 59:32.167
How did you get here?

59:32.458 --> 59:34.250
I walked, silly girl.

59:34.792 --> 59:37.917
What did you think? That I
crawled? That I slithered?

59:39.167 --> 59:40.875
Where do I know you from?

59:41.000 --> 59:43.125
You don't know me. Not at all.

59:43.333 --> 59:44.667
I'm leaving

59:46.333 --> 59:49.167
I will see you soon, Ainbo.

01:00:19.708 --> 01:00:21.000
Mr. DeWitt?

01:00:22.417 --> 01:00:23.333
What's wrong?

01:00:25.917 --> 01:00:28.167
You are not a man. You are...

01:00:30.708 --> 01:00:31.792
It's you!

01:00:34.625 --> 01:00:37.042
You are the Yacuruna.

01:00:37.125 --> 01:00:40.042
Well aren't you Mr. Smartypants.

01:00:49.917 --> 01:00:51.250
Did you see that?

01:00:52.042 --> 01:00:53.208
Now what?

01:00:53.417 --> 01:00:56.417
Let's get out of here. Quietly...

01:01:14.042 --> 01:01:14.958
Ainbo!

01:01:15.625 --> 01:01:17.250
Listen to me! Listen!

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.208
You are not the evil spirit

01:01:19.917 --> 01:01:21.750
It's the white man, Mr. DeWitt.

01:01:21.917 --> 01:01:23.208
You think I don't know?

01:01:23.375 --> 01:01:24.208
She knows.

01:01:24.292 --> 01:01:26.917
And what
she doesn't know, we do

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:29.042
What are those things?

01:01:29.167 --> 01:01:31.250
-Things!
-You got some nerve!

01:01:31.375 --> 01:01:32.833
They are my spirit guides

01:01:33.125 --> 01:01:35.083
You didn't believe in them either

01:01:35.542 --> 01:01:37.125
I was a fool

01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:39.000
Can you ever forgive me?

01:01:39.625 --> 01:01:41.542
So are you're glad I'm still alive?

01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:46.625
We all make mistakes, right guys?

01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:47.625
Oh yeah.

01:01:47.708 --> 01:01:49.917
It's true, he makes
mistakes all the time.

01:01:50.792 --> 01:01:52.083
-What?
-Guys!

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:55.167
From now on, no more mistakes

01:02:00.333 --> 01:02:02.417
It's time to show me the gold

01:02:03.083 --> 01:02:05.167
-Is there something wrong?
-The gold!

01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:09.792
-Papa?
-You need to leave our village

01:02:09.917 --> 01:02:10.750
Let Zumi...

01:02:10.833 --> 01:02:16.208
The gold!!

01:02:33.208 --> 01:02:35.417
Ainbo, may I help?

01:02:53.708 --> 01:02:57.125
Mother, please I need you

01:02:57.833 --> 01:02:59.417
I need you now

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:38.750
It's her.

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:40.708
Ainbo.

01:03:41.125 --> 01:03:42.250
Mother?

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.792
All these years I've watched
you, waiting for this day.

01:03:51.042 --> 01:03:53.667
-I love you, Ainbo.
-I love you, mama.

01:03:56.125 --> 01:03:58.750
I'm so happy for Ainbo

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.167
Then why are you crying?

01:04:01.292 --> 01:04:03.625
Look at you, you're sobby too

01:04:03.833 --> 01:04:05.917
No, I'm not!

01:04:08.833 --> 01:04:11.458
The golden-tipped arrow, where is it?

01:04:11.708 --> 01:04:13.500
It's here

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:18.375
We made it ourselves
and we didn't know why

01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:20.375
I think you did

01:04:20.625 --> 01:04:22.500
I whispered it into your ears

01:04:22.875 --> 01:04:24.917
-That was you?
-Yes

01:04:25.167 --> 01:04:27.125
Now give the arrow to me

01:05:07.208 --> 01:05:08.708
It's ready now

01:05:09.667 --> 01:05:11.625
Ready for what?

01:05:12.792 --> 01:05:13.875
Listen

01:05:35.125 --> 01:05:37.000
I've heard these sounds before

01:05:37.167 --> 01:05:40.083
It's the sound of the monsters
that belong to the Corona.

01:05:40.417 --> 01:05:41.917
They are coming for Candamo.

01:05:42.083 --> 01:05:43.375
We have to stop them

01:05:43.667 --> 01:05:46.542
-Atok
-I owe it to Ainbo and you

01:05:46.833 --> 01:05:49.083
No, you owe her the truth

01:05:49.875 --> 01:05:51.125
Now come

01:05:53.417 --> 01:05:55.292
-Now what?
-Follow me

01:06:11.458 --> 01:06:12.792
There she goes

01:06:13.917 --> 01:06:15.625
Where are we going?

01:06:16.875 --> 01:06:20.667
Candamo's gold now
belongs to our great shaman

01:06:20.917 --> 01:06:25.208
He has lifted the curse from
my father. From our village.

01:06:25.792 --> 01:06:28.875
We will repay him a thousand times over

01:06:29.125 --> 01:06:31.208
Soon, great ma...

01:06:31.667 --> 01:06:33.333
-Machines
-Machines

01:06:33.625 --> 01:06:36.750
Metal gods that dig for gold will arrive.

01:06:36.917 --> 01:06:41.167
You will serve them like you
will server our great shaman

01:06:41.667 --> 01:06:45.458
Now bow! Pay your
respects to our great shaman.

01:06:47.208 --> 01:06:50.083
You heard your princess. Bow!!

01:07:12.125 --> 01:07:14.375
I'm Lizeni of Candamo.

01:07:14.542 --> 01:07:18.917
I demand that you and
your machines leave!

01:07:19.667 --> 01:07:20.917
Leave our land!

01:07:21.167 --> 01:07:24.500
The land of our children
and our ancestors.

01:07:29.083 --> 01:07:31.292
Leave now!

01:07:39.333 --> 01:07:40.833
Follow us!

01:07:46.083 --> 01:07:48.167
-It was me!
-What?

01:07:48.458 --> 01:07:50.208
Your mother died because of me

01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:52.625
-You killed her?
-No!

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.875
Yes! No!

01:07:55.333 --> 01:07:57.167
It was my jealous heart

01:08:11.042 --> 01:08:13.917
The goddess. Lizeni, isn't it?

01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:17.875
You know who I am but
do you know who you are?

01:08:18.082 --> 01:08:19.832
I am the god of gold

01:08:20.125 --> 01:08:21.792
I am the ruler of the Amazon.

01:08:22.042 --> 01:08:25.332
Is that who you really are... Will?

01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:29.042
-Don't call me that, ever
-I challenge you

01:08:29.167 --> 01:08:31.250
-To what?
-To hear the truth

01:08:31.542 --> 01:08:35.042
-Is that all?
-The truth is everything

01:08:35.332 --> 01:08:37.250
Some of you remember,

01:08:37.332 --> 01:08:42.000
many years ago, I savedyour
life and brought you to the village

01:08:42.125 --> 01:08:45.167
-Stop it!
-Not everyone welcomes Will

01:08:45.332 --> 01:08:46.917
Some hated him

01:08:47.332 --> 01:08:49.917
It's true, I hated this stranger

01:08:50.082 --> 01:08:52.625
Because I thought Lizeni belonged to me

01:08:52.917 --> 01:08:55.125
But she fell in love with him

01:08:55.292 --> 01:08:58.750
I loved you, Will, and
you were in love with me

01:08:58.917 --> 01:09:00.125
No more!

01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:03.542
I thought you weren't afraid of the truth

01:09:04.042 --> 01:09:08.792
Atok told everyone that Will
cursed me Put me under his spell

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.207
My jealousy made me insane

01:09:11.542 --> 01:09:16.667
You Ainbo, you weren't even
born. But I already hated you too.

01:09:16.917 --> 01:09:19.082
We were condemned for loving each other

01:09:19.332 --> 01:09:21.500
Love was our only crime

01:09:22.332 --> 01:09:26.375
I was saved by the forest spirits,
and became one with the jungle.

01:09:27.625 --> 01:09:29.917
But the Yacuruna was waiting for Will.

01:09:30.375 --> 01:09:32.832
He was perfect prey for the Yacuruna.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.667
Lies! All of it!

01:09:34.792 --> 01:09:37.332
-You are Ainbo's father.
-Lies!

01:09:37.457 --> 01:09:38.917
You are nothing, Ainbo.

01:09:39.125 --> 01:09:42.125
I am the ultimate... I'm...

01:09:42.417 --> 01:09:48.125
I am the Yacuruna!

01:09:55.125 --> 01:10:00.125
We will no longer allow you to
destroy our land and enslave our people

01:10:00.292 --> 01:10:03.667
You believe you can conquer the Yacuruna?

01:10:03.917 --> 01:10:05.167
Maybe I cannot

01:10:05.333 --> 01:10:08.750
But what I cannot do, my daughter can

01:10:09.208 --> 01:10:11.875
A child, just a child.

01:10:14.917 --> 01:10:16.333
Mother!

01:10:18.792 --> 01:10:20.250
Zumi!

01:10:20.667 --> 01:10:21.750
No!

01:10:27.375 --> 01:10:28.542
Zumi!

01:10:29.708 --> 01:10:30.917
My daughter!

01:11:02.417 --> 01:11:05.792
It's your time, Ainbo. You
have one chance, one shot

01:11:06.042 --> 01:11:08.000
You have to stop him

01:11:08.125 --> 01:11:09.917
but he's my father

01:11:10.125 --> 01:11:13.042
He <i>was</i> your father Give the bow to me

01:11:15.083 --> 01:11:17.333
No, it's your bow

01:11:17.542 --> 01:11:19.458
Your arrow and your quest

01:11:19.625 --> 01:11:21.333
Only you can do it

01:11:21.625 --> 01:11:23.875
You want me to shoot my own father?

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.750
No, no, on the contrary

01:11:25.917 --> 01:11:28.167
You will free your
father from the Yacuruna.

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:29.208
That's right

01:11:29.333 --> 01:11:33.292
You'll shoot the Yacuruna.
The evil inside him.

01:11:33.625 --> 01:11:34.750
How do you know this?

01:11:35.167 --> 01:11:37.083
It was whispered in our ears

01:11:48.667 --> 01:11:51.625
-Zumi!
-We have to save her

01:11:51.917 --> 01:11:53.417
We'll save her

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:19.833
-Hol on!
-Hold on tight!

01:12:29.875 --> 01:12:33.292
Father, I know you're in there somewhere

01:12:33.917 --> 01:12:35.125
Dad!

01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:37.500
Do not dare call me that

01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:39.875
Dad! Can you hear me?

01:12:40.042 --> 01:12:41.125
No more!

01:12:42.375 --> 01:12:46.333
Zumi! Princess! Come close!

01:12:46.458 --> 01:12:48.708
I belong to the Yacuruna

01:12:54.917 --> 01:12:59.500
Do you, miserable little child,
think you can stop the Yacuruna?

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:03.625
Your pathetic arrow will
not even scratch my skin

01:13:05.792 --> 01:13:07.042
Ainbo

01:13:08.083 --> 01:13:09.167
Mother?

01:13:10.708 --> 01:13:13.208
Mother. Please guide my arrow

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:18.917
You don't need my help, you are ready now

01:13:20.042 --> 01:13:20.917
I know

01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:42.208
No!

01:13:56.708 --> 01:13:59.000
I'll catch you!

01:14:03.375 --> 01:14:05.000
-Thank you
-You're welcome

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:08.833
Zumi!

01:14:17.125 --> 01:14:18.750
Jump!

01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:23.333
We'll catch you!

01:14:30.250 --> 01:14:31.917
Jump!

01:14:39.917 --> 01:14:42.375
Ainbo, what happened?

01:15:00.125 --> 01:15:01.125
Father!

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.208
Father, we are free again

01:15:05.625 --> 01:15:07.042
The curse is over

01:15:07.542 --> 01:15:10.542
Free. We are free

01:15:17.833 --> 01:15:19.833
Who is this?

01:15:22.042 --> 01:15:23.292
It's Will

01:15:23.792 --> 01:15:26.167
-Will?
-It's your father

01:15:27.792 --> 01:15:29.083
Mother!

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.292
Father?

01:15:47.333 --> 01:15:50.542
-Are you my daughter?
-This is Ainbo.

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:55.708
Here, these will help

01:15:55.875 --> 01:15:59.333
My glasses. I lost these a long time ago

01:16:01.875 --> 01:16:04.625
Ainbo, you are very courageous.

01:16:05.042 --> 01:16:05.875
Thank you

01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:08.125
I never thought I'd meet you

01:16:08.792 --> 01:16:09.917
but...

01:16:15.708 --> 01:16:17.375
I'm afraid I can't stay

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.292
We do not belong in this world anymore

01:16:22.792 --> 01:16:25.500
We belong together at last

01:16:26.083 --> 01:16:27.833
and Ainbo, we'll be nearby

01:16:28.208 --> 01:16:29.458
I promise

01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:32.167
I promise too

01:16:32.375 --> 01:16:34.417
Will, I'll take good care of her

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:36.792
If you'll let me

01:16:41.375 --> 01:16:44.042
Good, but treat her
like you're her father

01:16:44.458 --> 01:16:45.500
Always

01:17:03.292 --> 01:17:06.000
We have to leave, our time is up

01:17:15.708 --> 01:17:17.667
You have to let us go now

01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:25.875
Ainbo!

01:17:57.667 --> 01:17:59.125
That's not a hug

01:17:59.625 --> 01:18:01.458
This is a hug

01:18:09.125 --> 01:18:10.167
Wow, Ainbo!

01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:13.375
You really saved us, you saved Candamo.

01:18:13.542 --> 01:18:16.250
But there's so much
more to do in the Amazon.

01:18:16.417 --> 01:18:20.208
Whatever it is, with your spirit
guides, it will be a piece of cake.

01:18:20.917 --> 01:18:22.000
With who?

01:18:22.333 --> 01:18:24.208
With us? No

01:18:24.458 --> 01:18:25.542
I'm afraid...

01:18:25.625 --> 01:18:29.250
We are afraid you have
to follow through yourselves

01:18:29.458 --> 01:18:31.250
Yes, yourselves

01:18:32.792 --> 01:18:34.083
We?

01:18:35.458 --> 01:18:37.250
Yes, us

01:20:14.875 --> 01:20:21.292
"In the jungle there's a
legend of courage and love"

01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:28.875
"Where a brave girl saves her
homeland, the Amazon so wild"

01:20:29.042 --> 01:20:34.333
"She is the guadian
watches night and day."

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.917
"With her power, this will stay."

01:20:39.042 --> 01:20:40.667
"will stay"

01:20:40.833 --> 01:20:43.875
"Yes, Ainbo's here."

01:20:44.042 --> 01:20:47.000
"Mighty spirits are her guide"

01:20:47.125 --> 01:20:53.333
"Yes, Ainbo's here
with magic by her side."

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:56.750
"No harm will come,
good things are done."

01:20:56.875 --> 01:21:03.875
"Yes, Ainbo's here to save paradise."

01:21:10.042 --> 01:21:15.500
"She is Ainbo, she's a
brave girl. She is full of love"

01:21:16.167 --> 01:21:19.083
"For her people, for her homeland"

01:21:19.167 --> 01:21:22.125
"The Amazon, so pure and wild"

01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:27.000
"The Amazon, so pure and wild"

01:21:27.125 --> 01:21:32.833
"Ainbo's here, mighty
spirits are her guide"

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:38.917
"Yes, Ainbo's here
with magic by her side."

01:21:39.083 --> 01:21:42.042
"No harm will come,
good things are done."

01:21:42.250 --> 01:21:45.125
"Our Amazon shines bright"

01:21:45.250 --> 01:21:47.917
"We're saying 'Goodbye darkness'"

01:21:48.083 --> 01:21:54.125
"Welcome light"

01:21:58.417 --> 01:22:04.792
"In the jungle there's a
legend of courage and love"
