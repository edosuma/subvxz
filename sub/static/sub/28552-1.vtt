- What a rush!
- That was incredible!

03:26.935 --> 03:28.719
I'll be in the study.

03:28.865 --> 03:30.542
I'll be right here,
cleaning up

03:30.629 --> 03:32.445
after your last adventure.

03:33.937 --> 03:37.508
Cool. I'm just
gonna lie here forever.

03:41.193 --> 03:44.760
Kids! Kids, I found a hidden
compartment in the idol!

03:46.165 --> 03:49.021
There's only
a treasure map inside!

03:49.108 --> 03:50.401
Let's go!

03:52.338 --> 03:55.211
Ugh! I need a break!

03:55.962 --> 03:59.061
Expired rations, old flares,
used gauze...

04:02.681 --> 04:04.270
I thought life
with a treasure hunter

04:04.357 --> 04:06.966
would be way more "treasure"
and way less hunting.

04:07.053 --> 04:08.968
Isn't it great?!
Charting the unknown,

04:09.055 --> 04:11.383
following in the family
tradition of adventure!

04:13.893 --> 04:16.281
You remember Mom
got lost in space, right?

04:16.369 --> 04:19.250
Well, yeah. But she went solo
without any help.

04:19.338 --> 04:22.181
We're a fine-tuned
action machine!

04:22.268 --> 04:23.723
I'm the brains,
Webby's the fist,

04:23.810 --> 04:24.993
Dewey's
the devil-may-care guts,

04:25.080 --> 04:26.306
you...

04:27.573 --> 04:29.862
are there, too!
Plus, it's earned me the rank

04:29.949 --> 04:33.359
of <i> Senior</i> Junior Woodchuck.
Two stripes!

04:33.446 --> 04:34.934
Look, I'm sure you'll
get time off

04:35.021 --> 04:36.362
after we find this treasure.

04:36.449 --> 04:37.930
Unless this treasure is cursed.

04:38.017 --> 04:39.872
And dispelling the curse
leads to a whole other adventure

04:39.959 --> 04:41.817
and so on forever, let's go!

04:42.621 --> 04:43.869
Fine.

04:43.956 --> 04:45.244
Hey, maybe when we get back,

04:45.331 --> 04:46.712
you can earn
that Sewing Badge.

04:46.799 --> 04:49.341
Please.

04:49.428 --> 04:52.811
I earned my Sewing Badge
ages ago. C'mon, I mean...

04:52.898 --> 04:54.851
Then how did this guy
come loose?

04:58.732 --> 04:59.952
That's impossible.

05:00.039 --> 05:02.161
Oh, you must be more tired
than you realized.

05:02.248 --> 05:03.270
You're slipping.

05:03.357 --> 05:05.355
I never would've used
a slip stitch.

05:05.462 --> 05:06.492
That is amateur hour!

05:06.579 --> 05:07.766
All this constant adventuring

05:07.853 --> 05:09.328
must have torn it apart!

05:11.351 --> 05:13.305
Uncle Scrooge!
All this constant adventuring

05:13.392 --> 05:14.807
is tearing us apart!

05:14.894 --> 05:17.988
Nonsense. We're closer than ever.
Eh, kids?

05:18.075 --> 05:20.169
<i>♪ Teamwork makes

05:20.256 --> 05:21.574
This needs to stop!

05:21.661 --> 05:25.010
I've tried, but they really do
enjoy harmonizing.

05:25.097 --> 05:27.980
With all the nonstop danger,
we never get any quality time.

05:28.067 --> 05:29.603
Do we really even
know each other?

05:29.690 --> 05:32.091
I mean, is this Huey?
Or... or Dewey? I don't know!

05:32.178 --> 05:33.578
Which one has the hat?

05:37.755 --> 05:39.825
There's no better
bonding experience

05:39.912 --> 05:42.418
than a high-stakes,
death-defying adventure.

05:42.505 --> 05:44.323
What about
a quiet movie night in?

05:44.410 --> 05:46.235
Oh! Or make-your-own-pizza
night!

05:46.322 --> 05:48.304
Ooh, how about game night?!

05:50.592 --> 05:52.056
Game night?

05:52.302 --> 05:53.883
Game night!

05:55.020 --> 05:56.403
Game night!

05:57.825 --> 05:59.688
Game night!

05:59.833 --> 06:02.547
- Game night!
- Oh, no.

06:02.634 --> 06:05.453
Ready for a relaxing night in?

06:05.540 --> 06:09.102
You know how competitive he gets
when he's trying to best an enemy?

06:09.189 --> 06:12.539
On Game Night,
we are the enemies.

06:13.649 --> 06:15.263
Partner up, everyone!

06:15.350 --> 06:17.373
If we lose,
you're out of the will.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.766
I was in the will?

06:21.422 --> 06:22.479
- I got Dewey!
- I got Webby!

06:22.566 --> 06:23.925
We're the perfect team
in the field.

06:24.012 --> 06:25.883
Game Night will be a snap!

06:26.584 --> 06:27.810
Oh, um...

06:28.037 --> 06:31.495
I sense that a dark magic's
afoot in the, uh...

06:31.582 --> 06:34.882
etherial plane.
I must go!

06:34.969 --> 06:36.617
No, you blasted phantasm!

06:36.704 --> 06:38.870
You will not leave me
to deal with this!

06:38.957 --> 06:42.301
Spooky things! Farewell!

06:43.567 --> 06:46.627
Ah, c'mon, don't worry,
Mrs. B.

06:46.714 --> 06:48.597
I'll be your game partner!

06:48.684 --> 06:50.567
Fine.

06:50.654 --> 06:52.750
At least we'll lose quickly.

06:53.288 --> 06:55.276
Well, I guess
that leaves us, Hue...

06:55.363 --> 06:58.926
You have a whole other thing
goin' on.

06:59.013 --> 07:00.229
You were right, man!

07:00.316 --> 07:02.392
We've gotta stay in!
Recenter!

07:02.479 --> 07:04.358
Sewing.
Totally basic skill.

07:04.445 --> 07:05.519
OK. Ha!

07:05.733 --> 07:07.067
Gah!

07:07.154 --> 07:09.517
OK. It'll be a weird,
stressful night in,

07:09.604 --> 07:10.591
but at least there's no...

07:10.678 --> 07:13.004
Adventure!

07:13.091 --> 07:14.383
Oh, no.

07:17.436 --> 07:19.457
Oh, yes, Green Nephew.
Behold!

07:19.544 --> 07:21.229
The Gearloose Micro-Phone,

07:21.316 --> 07:24.438
capable of amplifying
sub-decibillic feedback. Oh!

07:25.131 --> 07:27.460
It makes tiny sounds loud.

07:27.547 --> 07:29.537
<i>Go away! We don't want any!</i>

07:29.624 --> 07:32.358
I believe there's
a microscopic civilization

07:32.445 --> 07:35.383
of wandering nomads
invisible to the naked eye,

07:35.470 --> 07:38.012
living right here
in your home!

07:38.099 --> 07:40.670
Listen to the sweet call of adventure!

07:43.144 --> 07:46.652
- Whoa!
- Nope! Hard pass!

07:52.758 --> 07:54.535
- I also
added a shrink ray feature.

07:54.622 --> 07:57.372
We could shrink down,
make first contact

07:57.459 --> 08:01.042
with the teeny species whom I
have named "Gyropuddlians,"

08:01.129 --> 08:05.245
and conquer... I mean, explore
this tiny frontier!

08:05.332 --> 08:08.721
An entire universe
right under your family's feet!

08:08.808 --> 08:10.884
We'd never get a break.
Even when we were home,

08:10.971 --> 08:13.240
we would just keep on...
adventuring.

08:13.331 --> 08:15.881
Exactly! Now, where is
your uncle? We...

08:19.371 --> 08:21.180
What did you do?!

08:21.267 --> 08:22.728
You shrunk him!

08:22.964 --> 08:24.881
Which is exactly
what he wanted!

08:24.996 --> 08:27.141
- What?
- Everything'll be fine.

08:27.228 --> 08:31.118
Whoa! Gyro's shrunk down
and worshipped as a god-king!

08:31.205 --> 08:35.525
Wait, what? They're in a war
with a bunch of giant ants?

08:35.613 --> 08:37.573
Aah! He almost got eaten
by a spider

08:37.659 --> 08:40.804
but survives and teaches everybody
a lesson in trust or something!

08:40.892 --> 08:43.096
That did happen twice
last month.

08:43.183 --> 08:44.626
- But this...
<i>-  Primitive nomads,</i>

08:44.713 --> 08:47.479
<i>I give you the gift
of superior intellect!</i>

08:48.885 --> 08:50.783
<i> Uh, and this pen light!</i>

08:50.870 --> 08:52.673
<i>Ohh!</i>

08:52.760 --> 08:55.580
<i>Gyro! Gyro Gyro!</i>

08:55.667 --> 08:57.315
See? Everything's fine!

08:57.402 --> 08:59.149
C'mon, let Gyro
have his own adventure

08:59.236 --> 09:00.829
while we take it easy
for once.

09:00.916 --> 09:03.548
And we can have a quiet,
rejuvenating night in.

09:03.635 --> 09:05.622
Bone up on your skills?

09:07.428 --> 09:09.588
And we can't tell anybody,
because if you do tell anybody,

09:09.675 --> 09:11.360
things will only get worse,
until you'll never be able

09:11.447 --> 09:14.451
to sew a merit badge
onto a sash ever again, OK?!

09:26.313 --> 09:28.287
The Crabmen of Crustacea!

09:29.241 --> 09:30.495
Ha ha!

09:43.531 --> 09:45.141

09:45.228 --> 09:47.518
Oh,<i> that's</i> why
he picked Donald.

09:47.605 --> 09:50.057
Ya spend 30 years
guessing what Donald is saying,

09:50.144 --> 09:52.359
you must get good
at non-verbal communication.

09:52.446 --> 09:53.440
Time!

09:53.527 --> 09:56.174
It was a Mermanticore!

09:56.261 --> 09:58.643
<i>That</i> was a Mermanticore?!

09:58.730 --> 10:00.643
This is a Mermanticore!

10:02.202 --> 10:04.415
Mr. McDuck and Donald
scored 34.

10:06.081 --> 10:07.870
- No, this is a Mermanticore!
- Shh.

10:08.377 --> 10:09.516
Next up,

10:09.603 --> 10:10.713
Webby and Dewey!

10:12.972 --> 10:15.110
Those two can barely stand
each other!

10:15.197 --> 10:18.271
Imagine what a perfectly in
sync team like us can do!

10:21.777 --> 10:24.920
Aaand... go!

10:26.496 --> 10:27.830
Oh, this is easy!

10:37.165 --> 10:38.720
Bowler full of smoothies!

10:38.807 --> 10:39.900
Nailed it?

10:40.183 --> 10:43.303
Money? Expensive smoothies!

10:43.496 --> 10:45.834
Smoothies with cash in them!

10:45.933 --> 10:48.118
Swim away from the smoothies!

10:48.205 --> 10:50.502
An old man! Prune smoothies!

10:50.589 --> 10:51.634
- No?
- Time!

10:51.721 --> 10:54.752
Aah! It was Scrooge McDuck!

10:54.839 --> 10:57.377
But Uncle Scrooge
doesn't like smoothies.

10:57.464 --> 10:59.307

11:04.449 --> 11:06.118

11:36.488 --> 11:39.518
<i> I was!</i>
<i>Unfortunately, my people</i>

11:39.605 --> 11:41.532
<i>have declared war
on the evil giants.</i>

11:41.619 --> 11:43.693
- <i>That's you.</i>
- Wait, what?

11:43.878 --> 11:46.571
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>you've accidentally destroyed</i>

11:46.658 --> 11:48.862
<i>every tiny town
they've ever built.</i>

11:48.972 --> 11:50.597
<i>Laundry basket city.</i>

11:51.458 --> 11:53.208
<i>TopHotistan.</i>

11:53.989 --> 11:55.942
<i>The floating island
of Toiletopolis.</i>

11:59.099 --> 12:00.299
Ew!

12:00.386 --> 12:02.260
<i>I thought</i>
<i>I could shrink you down...</i>

12:02.347 --> 12:03.483
Nope. This is our night off.

12:03.570 --> 12:05.185
You can handle this mess
on your own!

12:05.272 --> 12:08.290
<i>Of course I can!</i>
<i>For I am Gyro the Mighty!</i>

12:08.377 --> 12:10.080
<i>Gyro the Unconquerable!</i>

12:10.167 --> 12:13.061
<i>Aah! Giant ants!
Shrink them! Shrink them!</i>

12:23.091 --> 12:24.278
Oh, come on!

12:24.365 --> 12:26.443
Hey, guys! Got any guacamole?

12:32.870 --> 12:33.915
<i>Or maybe some hummus?</i>

12:34.002 --> 12:35.568
Launchpad! Are you OK?

12:35.655 --> 12:38.774
<i>Yup! Wait. I seem to be stuck
in a giant world</i>

12:38.861 --> 12:42.850
<i>of nightmare horrors. Hey!
There's Gyro and a buncha guys.</i>

12:42.956 --> 12:45.118
<i>Ooh, a giant spider!</i>

12:45.205 --> 12:46.822
Louie! I know this is
our night off,

12:46.909 --> 12:47.921
but we gotta do something!

12:48.008 --> 12:49.338
Why? Gyro's a genius

12:49.425 --> 12:51.259
and Launchpad has crashed
so many times,

12:51.346 --> 12:52.952
I'm convinced
he may be immortal!

12:53.039 --> 12:55.405
We've been on dozens
of adventures.

12:55.492 --> 12:56.930
Why are these recent ones
any different?

12:57.017 --> 12:58.646
Look, I just, uh...

12:58.863 --> 13:00.159
We need a break, all right?

13:00.246 --> 13:01.501
Well, I'm telling
Uncle Scrooge.

13:01.588 --> 13:02.587
- Huey!
- Louie!

13:02.674 --> 13:05.466
Boys!
Have you seen Launchpad?

13:11.236 --> 13:14.529
He left for non-suspicious
reasons.

13:15.489 --> 13:19.270
Oh, no.
Without my partner,

13:19.357 --> 13:21.563
I can't play.
Curse my luck.

13:21.650 --> 13:24.029
Just... curse it.
Goodnight.

13:25.316 --> 13:28.582
One calm night, and I promise,
we'll set everything straight.

13:30.214 --> 13:33.466
Careful. Careful.

13:33.553 --> 13:35.463
- Careful!
- Will you pipe down?

13:35.550 --> 13:37.766
I reassembled the urn
of Pharaoh Duckmouse the Third...

13:37.853 --> 13:39.639
Now! Do it now!

13:42.763 --> 13:45.657
- Yeah!
- Team Uncle for the win!

13:45.744 --> 13:47.883
Yah!

13:48.034 --> 13:49.549
- Uh...
- Mm-mmm.

13:49.636 --> 13:51.151
Hey, guys! Just in time

13:51.238 --> 13:53.373
to watch us totally
embarrass the olds.

13:53.460 --> 13:54.472
You got this?

13:54.559 --> 13:56.795
Does a valtportinger
have wings?

13:56.973 --> 13:58.920
- It does.
- Uh... knew that!

13:59.007 --> 14:02.350
I knew that.
Totally in sync. Break.

14:02.604 --> 14:04.936
I'll tap the block
You pull from the other side.

14:08.310 --> 14:10.904
- You're tapping two blocks.
- No, I'm not!

14:11.021 --> 14:13.073
Well, it's not moving
by itself.

14:16.848 --> 14:18.186
Launchpad, where are you?

14:18.273 --> 14:19.493
<i>Well, in honor of</i>

14:19.580 --> 14:20.876
<i>our victory over the spider,</i>

14:20.963 --> 14:22.549
<i>Gyro demanded an offering.</i>

14:22.636 --> 14:25.118
<i>So, we're trying to conquer
the Tower of Infinity</i>

14:25.205 --> 14:26.220
<i>in the TV room.</i>

14:26.307 --> 14:28.365
Tower of Infinity? What?!

14:31.098 --> 14:32.519
Launchpad, stop them!

14:32.606 --> 14:35.186
If both blocks come out,
the tower will collapse!

14:35.273 --> 14:37.072
You'll be...

14:44.124 --> 14:45.145
<i>The number you have reached</i>

14:45.232 --> 14:46.516
<i>has been disconnected.</i>

14:46.788 --> 14:47.889
No, no, no, no, no, no,

14:47.967 --> 14:49.159
no, no, no, no, no!

14:50.203 --> 14:51.774
Careful, you'll crush them!

14:51.861 --> 14:55.054
- They're already crushed!
- Why?

14:55.141 --> 14:56.967
Why?!

14:57.054 --> 14:59.450
Guys, relax.
It's just a game.

14:59.537 --> 15:00.925
Yeah, a game you lost for us.

15:01.012 --> 15:02.026
- What?
- Nothing!

15:04.414 --> 15:06.079
<i>Uh... hello?</i>

15:09.481 --> 15:11.029
Yes!

15:11.848 --> 15:14.213
It's nice to talk
to friends on the phone.

15:14.300 --> 15:17.253
It's so much more personal
than texting.

15:18.021 --> 15:21.507
OK? Next game!

15:22.896 --> 15:25.044
Launchpad! How are you OK?

15:25.131 --> 15:27.487
<i>The good news is,
the Gyropuddlians are fast.</i>

15:27.574 --> 15:30.484
<i>The bad news is, they thought
the tower was a trap,</i>

15:30.571 --> 15:33.193
<i>so now they've decided
to use Gyro's doohickey</i>

15:33.280 --> 15:35.265
<i>to declare war on us all.</i>

15:35.427 --> 15:37.779
<i> Unhand me,</i>
<i>intellectual inferiors!</i>

15:37.866 --> 15:40.049
<i> Now, Gyro,</i>
<i>you catch more flies</i>

15:40.136 --> 15:41.698
<i>with honey than vinegar.</i>

15:41.785 --> 15:44.644
<i>Aah! Giant flies! Aah!</i>

15:44.731 --> 15:46.698
<i>They caught and trained them!</i>

15:46.785 --> 15:48.726
What are we gonna do, Louie?!

15:49.193 --> 15:52.710
Just a fun night in.
No stress. Wonderful memories.

15:53.163 --> 15:54.974
Hey, what is up with you?

15:55.061 --> 15:56.971
Nothing, I'm just lovably lazy!

15:57.058 --> 15:59.894
No, seriously.
Why have you been so down

15:59.981 --> 16:01.073
on adventuring lately?

16:01.160 --> 16:03.296
Because I'm not good at it, OK?

16:04.671 --> 16:07.062
You guys all have your things.

16:07.769 --> 16:11.468
Mom was great at adventuring,
and she still got hurt.

16:12.379 --> 16:14.844
I'm only good
at talking my way out of it.

16:15.846 --> 16:17.781
How long before
that's not enough?

16:21.955 --> 16:23.893
Are you really gonna
let our family get hurt

16:23.980 --> 16:25.804
because you're afraid
to get hurt?

16:26.302 --> 16:28.445
Wait! Where's the Mirco-phone?

16:34.349 --> 16:37.869
Behold, the final challenge.

16:37.956 --> 16:39.898
Scroogeopoly!

16:39.985 --> 16:43.424
The thrilling game of finance
and property acquisition.

16:43.511 --> 16:46.859
The final challenge feels
extremely rigged.

16:46.989 --> 16:49.088
Your face is literally
on the box.

16:49.175 --> 16:52.958
Nonsense! Now, which piece
will your team play as?

16:53.115 --> 16:54.240
Actually, maybe...

16:54.327 --> 16:56.658
Yeah, maybe we'll play
on our own.

16:56.745 --> 16:58.122
I'll be the top hat!

16:58.209 --> 17:00.436
I'll be the other top hat.

17:00.523 --> 17:02.808
And I will be the top hat.

17:02.895 --> 17:04.796
Oldest player goes first!

17:06.942 --> 17:08.882
Aah! They're gonna shrink
everybody!

17:08.969 --> 17:11.699
I'll buy Dawson,
put bins in Howduyustan,

17:11.786 --> 17:14.270
and collect rent and dividends
on all the rest!

17:14.866 --> 17:17.132
And Donald lands in jail.

17:17.340 --> 17:18.970
Again?!

17:21.647 --> 17:23.228
And that'll be taxes and fees

17:23.315 --> 17:24.880
for each property you own.

17:24.967 --> 17:26.376
Ha! And I thought
you were easy

17:26.463 --> 17:27.460
to beat as a team.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.442
- Huh?
- Isn't anybody willing to put up a fight?

17:42.472 --> 17:43.920
Hi, Dewey!

17:52.379 --> 17:54.304
Is this part of the game?

17:54.391 --> 17:56.251
- Or... uh...
- Careful!

17:56.338 --> 17:58.093
They don't trust outsiders
for some reason!

18:00.706 --> 18:02.965
Quick, unshrink them!

18:06.454 --> 18:07.514
Not him!

18:07.601 --> 18:09.046
Huh? Hmm.

18:15.580 --> 18:18.418
We can't just blast wildly!
We need a plan!

18:19.249 --> 18:22.319
Hmm, what do I do?
What do I do? What do I do?

18:22.406 --> 18:24.504
What do <i> I</i> do?

18:30.128 --> 18:31.415
That's what I do!

18:31.502 --> 18:33.972
- Everybody, listen!
- Louie?!

18:34.059 --> 18:35.579
Hey, Louie!

18:35.666 --> 18:37.538
Launchpad!
Crash your way outta there

18:37.625 --> 18:38.972
to break 'em up!

18:39.059 --> 18:41.415
OK, but what do I crash with?

18:41.502 --> 18:43.593
I don't see anything crashable.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.348
Ow! Ow! Owie!

18:45.435 --> 18:47.976
Scrooge and Donald,
corral the Gyropuddlians

18:48.063 --> 18:49.543
onto Barks Place!

18:52.134 --> 18:54.817
Come on, ya miniscule
hooligans!

19:03.729 --> 19:07.295
Huey! Show 'em what a Senior
Junior Woodchuck can do!

19:10.256 --> 19:13.037
Seam. Stitching line. Yoke.

19:13.115 --> 19:14.887
- Hmm?
- Basting stitch.

19:17.549 --> 19:20.093
Dewey, Webby, get up
to those flies!

19:23.384 --> 19:25.430
Shouldn't Scrooge
and Donald do it?

19:25.517 --> 19:27.468
Kinda busy now, kids!

19:27.555 --> 19:30.569
But you guys are totally in sync!

19:32.063 --> 19:33.619
Are you daft?

19:33.706 --> 19:35.984
I'm a billionaire,
he's a moocher

19:36.071 --> 19:38.547
that lives in that pool
and eats my food!

19:38.675 --> 19:39.780
Hey!

19:41.014 --> 19:42.609
Hey!

19:43.509 --> 19:47.406
We lost every game! We argue
and we have nothing in common.

19:47.493 --> 19:49.938
Outside of adventure,
how are we even friends?

19:50.025 --> 19:51.547
Of course you're not friends!

19:51.634 --> 19:53.469
You drive each other crazier
than anyone could

19:53.556 --> 19:55.530
and still care about each other
more than anyone.

19:55.617 --> 19:59.121
You're not friends.
You're family!

20:01.160 --> 20:02.559
Now, move!

20:08.934 --> 20:12.675
- Together!
- <i>♪ Teamwork makes the dream work ♪</i>

20:16.308 --> 20:18.875
Almost... almost...

20:23.567 --> 20:24.735
Now!

20:32.869 --> 20:35.996
So, I believe
it was my turn.

20:43.868 --> 20:47.964
I have 13 different apologies,
depending on how mad you are.

20:48.217 --> 20:49.910
Close the door.

20:50.309 --> 20:52.222
Oh, you're that mad.

20:57.625 --> 20:59.924
You saw the angles,
didn't you?

21:00.985 --> 21:02.745
You saw the pieces
on the board,

21:02.832 --> 21:06.772
devised a plan, delegated
and executed perfectly.

21:06.859 --> 21:08.456
You even offered
the wee warriors

21:08.543 --> 21:11.180
a permanent home.

21:11.514 --> 21:13.372
Do you know how I made
my fortune?

21:13.459 --> 21:15.497
Yes. By being tougher
than the toughies

21:15.584 --> 21:17.066
and smarter than the smarties.

21:17.153 --> 21:19.918
And sharper than the sharpies.

21:20.005 --> 21:21.360
People don't know
about that one.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.051
The ability to read a situation

21:23.138 --> 21:25.474
and see all the shortcuts
and the possibilities.

21:25.592 --> 21:28.810
You mother could do it.
So can you.

21:29.060 --> 21:30.193
I can?

21:30.474 --> 21:32.128
I should have seen it,
the way you were

21:32.215 --> 21:34.480
picking apart
those adventures earlier.

21:34.567 --> 21:37.242
The "Whoa," the "Wait, what,"
the "Aah."

21:37.329 --> 21:39.341
If you apply that gift,

21:39.428 --> 21:43.688
you might be a bigger
billionaire than I am one day.

21:44.021 --> 21:46.700
Here. It's not
a Number One Dime,

21:46.787 --> 21:47.997
but it's a start.

21:48.084 --> 21:49.643
Whoa!
