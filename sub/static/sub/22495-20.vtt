00:47.475 --> 00:48.621
They just arrived!

00:48.741 --> 00:51.635
There's a fat kid, a normal kid,
a greedy kid, and a TV watcher.

00:51.755 --> 00:55.357
Okay, people, we got to write four new
oompa loompa rejection songs in an hour.

00:55.392 --> 00:57.660
Okay, what if, uh, for the
fat kid, we're like...

00:57.696 --> 00:59.216
♪ Don't eat ice cream ♪

00:59.290 --> 01:01.056
♪ or cake or pie ♪

01:01.092 --> 01:03.992
♪ if you wonder, you shouldn't ask why ♪

01:04.027 --> 01:04.391
No!

01:04.428 --> 01:05.961
W-what are we saying about cake?

01:05.996 --> 01:09.264
So, uh, f-for the bubble-gum girl, how about...
♪ You've gotten

01:09.299 --> 01:12.066
yourself into a sticky situation ♪

01:13.703 --> 01:14.268
Got it!

01:14.304 --> 01:16.336
We compare the fat kid
to an elephant, yeah?

01:16.372 --> 01:18.838
Guys, that fat kid's already
in the chocolate river.

01:18.874 --> 01:19.739
We need to go now!

01:19.775 --> 01:23.344
Okay, let's just do the elephant
idea, and we'll improvise the rest.

01:23.379 --> 01:25.379
Hoo! Hoo!

01:25.414 --> 01:26.313
Eat at <i>Hooters!</i>

01:26.348 --> 01:27.147
<i>No thanks.</i>

01:27.182 --> 01:28.414
<i>Their food's terrible.</i>

01:28.450 --> 01:30.550
<i>You are missing the point of Hooters!</i>

01:30.586 --> 01:33.587
<i>No, Hooters is missing the point
on how to prepare even the</i>

01:33.622 --> 01:35.088
<i>most straightforward bar food.</i>

01:35.124 --> 01:37.091
<i>We'll have to agree to disagree.</i>

01:37.126 --> 01:39.627
<i>I agree to nothing, you dumb [bleep] owl!</i>

01:39.662 --> 01:41.228
<i>Happy Birthday, Billy!</i>

01:41.264 --> 01:43.531
<i>Look who showed up for your party.</i>

01:44.600 --> 01:46.501
<i>Who wants a balloon?</i>

01:46.536 --> 01:46.834
<i>Oh!</i>

01:46.870 --> 01:47.935
<i>Game's up, joker!</i>

01:47.971 --> 01:48.703
<i>Ohh! Ohh!</i>

01:48.738 --> 01:49.270
<i>Stop!</i>

01:49.305 --> 01:50.470
<i>T-that's not the joker!</i>

01:50.506 --> 01:52.839
<i>Uh, that's just a
birthday clown we hired.</i>

01:52.875 --> 01:53.474
<i>Huh.</i>

01:53.509 --> 01:56.143
<i>This happens more often than you'd think.</i>

02:00.851 --> 02:01.691
<i>A little help, buddy!</i>

02:05.889 --> 02:08.155
<i>Really could've used a hand there.</i>

02:08.191 --> 02:09.423
<i>You're just made of straw.</i>

02:10.393 --> 02:15.196
<i>And so, the hobo-eating boxcar
had enticed another victim.</i>

02:15.231 --> 02:17.131
<i>Pardon me, monsieur food critic.</i>

02:17.167 --> 02:18.199
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

02:18.234 --> 02:19.667
<i>Everything!</i>

02:19.702 --> 02:24.005
<i>I'm giving your restaurant
my lowest marks.</i>

02:24.041 --> 02:26.141
<i>A bad review will ruin us, Linguini!</i>

02:26.176 --> 02:28.109
<i>Quick, get him a new plate!</i>

02:30.047 --> 02:32.247
<i>No, I'm not finished hating it yet!</i>

02:34.051 --> 02:34.717
<i>Oh, a rat!</i>

02:34.752 --> 02:37.286
<i>It's a rat! It's a rat!</i>

02:39.557 --> 02:40.523
<i>A cat!</i>

02:40.558 --> 02:42.358
<i>Oh, sacre bleu -- a cat!</i>

02:42.393 --> 02:43.460
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

02:43.495 --> 02:45.295
<i>He threatened my family!</i>

02:51.603 --> 02:53.269
<i>Ha!</i>

03:18.095 --> 03:19.461
<i>Whew!</i>

03:19.497 --> 03:21.364
<i>Excellent shot, monsieur policeman.</i>

03:21.399 --> 03:23.833
<i>Ah, yes, but every dog has its day.</i>

03:25.903 --> 03:26.902
<i>Not bad!</i>

03:26.938 --> 03:33.041
<i>Warriors, come out play!</i>

03:33.077 --> 03:37.478
<i>Warriors, come out to play!</i>

03:37.514 --> 03:39.814
<i>All: Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear, turn around!</i>

03:39.849 --> 03:42.283
<i>Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear, touch the ground!</i>

03:47.657 --> 03:48.990
<i>Whore!</i>

03:49.025 --> 03:52.226
<i>When you've been out here as
long as I have, out on the</i>

03:52.261 --> 03:56.463
<i>prairie, just you and nature and
the sky, you learn that it's all</i>

03:56.498 --> 03:58.731
<i>about one thing.</i>

03:58.767 --> 04:00.266
<i>What's your one thing?</i>

04:00.301 --> 04:02.234
<i>I [bleep] cows.</i>

04:02.270 --> 04:03.335
<i>I don't get it, Samson.</i>

04:03.371 --> 04:04.303
<i>What is the plan again?</i>

04:04.338 --> 04:05.371
<i>It's simple.</i>

04:05.406 --> 04:08.507
<i>Those Philistines married
my wife to another man!</i>

04:08.542 --> 04:13.078
<i>So I've trapped about 150 foxes and
tied them into pairs, tail to tail.</i>

04:13.113 --> 04:16.248
<i>Now I'm going to attach a torch
to each fox team, light the</i>

04:16.283 --> 04:21.120
<i>torches on fire, and let the teams of foxes
run wild through the philistine fields.</i>

04:21.154 --> 04:22.621
<i>Get it?</i>

04:22.656 --> 04:26.558
<i>It's stories like this that make
people not believe the Bible.</i>

04:30.731 --> 04:32.397
<i>My house!</i>

04:32.433 --> 04:35.834
<i>I don't think porky pig
owns that establishment.</i>

04:35.869 --> 04:42.107
<i>We must've made a wrong
turn at Albuquerque.</i>

04:42.143 --> 04:44.676
<i>Now, don't put all your
eggs in one basket.</i>

04:44.712 --> 04:45.410
<i>Why not?</i>

04:49.183 --> 04:50.616
<i>Daddy, what's that place?</i>

04:50.651 --> 04:53.686
<i>That's a manure depot, son,
where manure is processed and</i>

04:53.721 --> 04:54.720
<i>sold to customers.</i>

04:54.755 --> 04:56.088
<i>Like a poo-poo factory?</i>

04:56.123 --> 04:59.091
<i>That's right, son, like a poop factory.</i>

04:59.127 --> 05:01.060
<i>Sir, that is a Hooters.</i>

05:01.096 --> 05:04.097
<i>You're deliberately
misinforming your son.</i>

05:04.132 --> 05:07.200
<i>Actually, I think I'm
being accurate as hell.</i>

05:07.235 --> 05:08.634
<i>Take a good look!</i>

05:08.670 --> 05:11.237
<i>80 years ago, this was cool as balls!</i>

05:12.174 --> 05:14.274
<i>Now I look like a [bleep] ass [bleep]</i>

05:15.077 --> 05:16.777
<i>The culture moves on, my friends.</i>

05:16.813 --> 05:21.716
<i>The culture moves on.</i>

05:25.956 --> 05:27.556
<i>Party weekend at the cabin!</i>

05:27.591 --> 05:29.557
<i>Let's all toss a football around!</i>

05:29.593 --> 05:31.159
<i>I say we all get high, yo!</i>

05:31.194 --> 05:33.328
<i>I really have some studying to do!</i>

05:33.364 --> 05:34.629
<i>Let's all have sex!</i>

05:34.665 --> 05:37.766
<i>I'm not having sex until I
find that special someone.</i>

05:37.801 --> 05:38.033
<i>Mm!</i>

05:38.068 --> 05:40.435
<i>Wow, now, those are some efficient
character introductions.</i>

05:40.471 --> 05:42.504
<i>Well, when you're making
entertainment to appease the</i>

05:42.539 --> 05:43.939
<i>gods, you got to be clear about it.</i>

05:43.941 --> 05:44.473
<i>H-hang on.</i>

05:44.508 --> 05:45.374
<i>What's this about gods?</i>

05:45.409 --> 05:47.776
<i>Yeah, in the old days, a simple
human sacrifice would do,</i>

05:47.811 --> 05:49.845
<i>but the gods got more
sophisticated over time.</i>

05:49.881 --> 05:50.646
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

05:50.682 --> 05:52.715
<i>Isn't this exactly like
that Joss Whedon movie</i>

05:52.750 --> 05:53.683
<i>"Cabin in the Woods"?</i>

05:53.718 --> 05:55.618
<i>Co-written and directed by Drew Goddard.</i>

05:55.654 --> 05:57.887
<i>Oh, I think I hear Roger
Ebert, but he can't talk</i>

05:57.922 --> 06:00.222
<i>anymore, so who the [bleep] are you?!</i>

06:04.195 --> 06:06.796
<i>I bet that basement is a
great place to get high!</i>

06:06.831 --> 06:09.165
<i>Oh, maybe there are some
footballs down there.</i>

06:09.200 --> 06:10.366
<i>Or books for reading!</i>

06:10.401 --> 06:12.902
<i>Or a place to get our bone on!</i>

06:12.938 --> 06:16.739
<i>Or a place to keep our penises
flaccid and our vaginas dry!</i>

06:16.775 --> 06:20.143
<i>Entertainment for the gods,</i>
are you guys are in charge of it?

06:20.178 --> 06:21.511
There are lots of gods.

06:21.546 --> 06:23.947
But currently, only one
God needs appeasing.

06:23.982 --> 06:26.149
It's alive!

06:26.184 --> 06:29.719
Well, g-guys that God looks exactly
like the average Adult Swim viewer.

06:29.754 --> 06:32.221
Does he, or do Adult Swim
viewers look like <i>him?</i>

06:32.957 --> 06:36.258
<i>The point is, no one panders to
Adult Swim viewers the way we do.</i>

06:36.294 --> 06:38.227
<i>The cellar is filled with talismans.</i>

06:38.262 --> 06:41.696
<i>Whatever they choose, that's
what will kill them all!</i>

06:41.732 --> 06:44.199
<i>If she opens one of those
books, they'll all be</i>

06:44.234 --> 06:45.667
<i>impregnated by vampires.</i>

06:48.872 --> 06:52.974
<i>If he opens that book, Alan
Moore will be very </i> unhappy.

06:56.146 --> 06:59.181
If he picks that up, they'll all
become so bored that they --

06:59.216 --> 07:02.118
Hey, look, a "Robot Chicken"
nerd action figure.

07:02.153 --> 07:03.185
Hi, everybody!

07:03.221 --> 07:05.088
Ooh, it's spooky down here!

07:05.123 --> 07:06.356
Yuck! Is that a spider?!

07:06.391 --> 07:09.760
Okay, the second thing they
choos <i>that's</i> what kills them all.

07:09.796 --> 07:11.062
Where'd he come from?!

07:11.097 --> 07:13.797
Oh, come on, guys, we can't have two nerds!

07:13.833 --> 07:14.198
Ohh!

07:15.067 --> 07:16.300
Zombie Joss Whedon!

07:16.335 --> 07:17.734
All right!

07:17.770 --> 07:20.070
Somebody found the "Buffy" DVDs!

07:20.105 --> 07:20.804
Gross!

07:20.839 --> 07:23.674
I thought this was a
cheerleading documentary.

07:23.709 --> 07:25.108
Why is Joss Whedon a zombie?

07:25.144 --> 07:25.843
Punishment.

07:25.878 --> 07:27.811
We told him about this place over drinks.

07:27.847 --> 07:31.181
The next thing we know, "Cabin in the
Woods" was in theaters nationwide.

07:31.216 --> 07:33.417
People weren't necessarily
<i>in those theaters.</i>

07:33.452 --> 07:35.420
<i>Well, regardless, we made him a zombie.</i>

07:39.193 --> 07:40.992
<i>Aah!</i>

07:41.028 --> 07:44.930
<i>Now you cut short like
my TV series "Firefly"!</i>

07:44.965 --> 07:45.898
<i>You bastard!</i>

07:45.933 --> 07:48.000
<i>We were gonna be together forever!</i>

07:48.903 --> 07:49.568
<i>Oh!</i>

07:49.604 --> 07:54.941
<i>That's short-sighted, like fox execs
when they canceled "Dollhouse."</i>

07:54.976 --> 07:58.111
<i>Being chased by a zombie
fills me with anxiety.</i>

07:58.146 --> 08:00.347
<i>Hey, you know what's good for anxiety?</i>

08:00.382 --> 08:01.348
<i>Getting high!</i>

08:02.518 --> 08:03.116
<i>Oh!</i>

08:03.152 --> 08:04.952
<i>[Bleep] network TV!</i>

08:06.055 --> 08:07.755
<i>Is the point I was making earlier.</i>

08:07.790 --> 08:09.590
<i>Okay, here's where it gets tricky.</i>

08:09.625 --> 08:10.858
<i>The virgin has to die last.</i>

08:10.893 --> 08:14.428
<i>We're 3/4 of the way through this
thing, and you drop that bombshell now?</i>

08:17.400 --> 08:17.932
<i>Come on!</i>

08:17.967 --> 08:20.234
<i>I'm gonna get into the
hole under the bush!</i>

08:20.269 --> 08:22.103
<i>The hell you will!</i>

08:22.138 --> 08:25.039
<i>Oh.</i>

08:25.074 --> 08:28.042
<i>What is this place?</i>

08:32.181 --> 08:32.681
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

08:32.716 --> 08:33.914
<i>They discovered our zoo!</i>

08:33.950 --> 08:36.384
<i>You know, our zoo of mythical
creatures and monsters and</i>

08:36.419 --> 08:38.619
<i>animals that --
Thanks. Got it.</i>

08:39.688 --> 08:40.354
<i>Aah!</i>

08:40.389 --> 08:41.087
<i>Whoa!</i>

08:41.123 --> 08:42.523
<i>He's Skeletor!</i>

08:42.558 --> 08:48.796
<i>On my planet, you would be Nerd-Dor,
Lord of Crusty Sock Mountain!</i>

08:48.831 --> 08:50.698
<i>Honestly, kid  off.</i>

08:55.738 --> 08:57.404
<i>Oh, no, it's locked!</i>

08:59.274 --> 09:04.177
<i>Try pulling the switch
labeled "unlocked"!</i>

09:04.213 --> 09:04.911
<i>Whoops!</i>

09:04.947 --> 09:06.413
<i>It turns counterclockwise!</i>

09:06.448 --> 09:07.914
<i>Just go!</i>

09:14.288 --> 09:16.055
<i>Grr! Argh!</i>

09:16.090 --> 09:17.723
<i>Wait, I figured it out!</i>

09:17.759 --> 09:19.992
<i>We're re-enacting a horror movie!</i>

09:20.028 --> 09:21.794
<i>The virgin always dies last.</i>

09:21.829 --> 09:23.629
<i>Both: So I guess I'm next!</i>

09:23.664 --> 09:27.732
<i>Wait, you mean you're</i> a -- me too!

09:27.768 --> 09:33.137
Wow, it's literally [bleep] or die!

09:33.173 --> 09:37.708
So... I haven't decided yet.

09:38.778 --> 09:40.344
Grr! Argh!

09:40.380 --> 09:41.145
Oh! Oh!

09:41.180 --> 09:42.313
Wait a minute.

09:42.348 --> 09:43.881
So, I put <i>this</i> in <i>there?</i>

09:43.916 --> 09:44.482
<i>Yes!</i>

09:44.517 --> 09:47.551
<i>Now just move it back and
forth for 30 to 40 minutes.</i>

09:47.587 --> 09:49.587
<i>And</i> finished!

09:49.622 --> 09:50.487
Thank you!

09:50.523 --> 09:52.689
I waited 23 years for <i>that?!</i>

09:55.828 --> 09:56.426
<i>We win!</i>

09:56.462 --> 09:57.527
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

09:57.563 --> 09:58.094
<i>They won!</i>

09:58.130 --> 09:59.262
<i>The earth is doomed!</i>

09:59.297 --> 09:59.996
<i>Holy crap!</i>

10:00.031 --> 10:01.731
<i>So now that God destroys us all?!</i>

10:01.766 --> 10:02.465
<i>Maybe not!</i>

10:02.500 --> 10:05.468
<i>His generation is really sporadic
with their viewing habits.</i>

10:05.503 --> 10:08.404
<i>He could catch it online in a
few weeks or next year when the</i>

10:08.439 --> 10:09.571
<i>DVD box set comes out!</i>

10:11.175 --> 10:13.575
<i>Both: Hi, Keith. Hi, Lazzo.</i>

10:13.611 --> 10:15.844
<i>You dumbasses realize
you're canceled, right?</i>

10:15.880 --> 10:19.014
<i>Both: Yes.</i>

10:19.050 --> 10:21.417
<i>Looks like Adult Swim needs a new show.</i>

10:21.452 --> 10:23.719
<i>So, there's this security
guard named Zeb.</i>

10:23.754 --> 10:27.389
<i>He's strict but fair, and his co-workers
are all wacky but in different ways.</i>

10:27.425 --> 10:29.158
<i>I'm gonna stop you right there.</i>

10:29.194 --> 10:30.735
<i>Who the [bleep] are you?</i>
