KARA: This season
on Supergirl...

00:03.071 --> 00:04.638
-Up, up?
-And away.

00:04.672 --> 00:07.375
My name is M'gann M'orzz.
I'm the last daughter of Mars.

00:07.408 --> 00:09.043
HANK HENSHAW:
You're a White Martian?

00:09.077 --> 00:10.311
M'GANN: I wanted
to be your friend.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.445
HANK HENSHAW:
You're my friend.

00:11.479 --> 00:12.780
I'm going back to Mars.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.515
Goodbye, Miss Martian.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.384
So, our mystery alien
is from Daxam.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.052
It's a sister world
to Krypton.

00:18.086 --> 00:19.553
-May name is Mon-El.
-Daxam is still there,

00:19.587 --> 00:20.621
but it's a wasteland.

00:20.654 --> 00:21.789
I wanna be a superhero.

00:21.822 --> 00:23.257
I wanna help you,
keep the world spinning.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.692
I've never felt
like this about...

00:24.725 --> 00:25.826
About anyone.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.429
Kara and I are dating.
Yes, it's awesome.

00:28.462 --> 00:33.134
These are my parents,
Queen Rhea
and King Lar Gand of Daxam.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.103
I'm done being your Prince.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.804
RHEA: Krypton has taken
everything from me.

00:36.837 --> 00:38.639
-We will move on.
-RHEA: We won't.

00:38.672 --> 00:41.342
-(LAR GAND GRUNTS)
-You betrayed me, my love.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.444
Thanks for stopping by, Mom.

00:45.179 --> 00:48.282
Welcome to New Daxam.

00:48.316 --> 00:49.383
CAT: It's Cat Grant.

00:49.417 --> 00:50.851
I've been away for a while,

00:50.884 --> 00:52.286
but I'm back.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.355
RHEA: You really thought
you'd won.

(PANTING)

01:23.417 --> 01:25.219
What have you done to him?

01:25.253 --> 01:27.721
I once told you
that my planet was riddled

01:27.755 --> 01:29.157
with the corpse of yours.

01:29.190 --> 01:32.826
But not only Green Kryptonite
rained down from the skies.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.796
There are so many more ways
to harm your kind

01:35.829 --> 01:37.765
than to simply weaken you.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.133
(SCREAMS)

01:41.169 --> 01:42.570
Silver Kryptonite.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.306
Your cousin is
so much like you.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.908
Reckless, stupid.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.510
Barreling headfirst
into danger.

01:49.543 --> 01:52.246
I couldn't have set
a better trap if I tried.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.315
-(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)
-Kal?

01:54.815 --> 01:56.284
It's me, Kara!

01:56.317 --> 01:58.886
Oh, he doesn't see you.

01:58.919 --> 02:01.922
He sees his worst enemy.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.457
You should have
stayed away, Zod.

02:03.491 --> 02:06.394
Your carcass will lie
dead at my feet, Kal-El.

02:06.427 --> 02:09.763
And the people of this planet
will kneel before me!

02:09.797 --> 02:11.665
Kal, listen to me.

02:18.406 --> 02:20.941
You're his mortal enemy,
Supergirl.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.943
The person he fears most.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.946
You will take
everything from him,

02:25.979 --> 02:28.416
so, this time,
he will not hesitate.

02:28.449 --> 02:31.319
This time,
he will protect his planet.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.821
-This time...
-I'll stop you forever.

The DEO system registered
a major Kryptonite signature

It's okay, I got you.
I'm here.

05:33.567 --> 05:34.902
I'm here.

05:58.426 --> 06:02.062
Let's just stay here
a little while longer, okay?

06:02.863 --> 06:03.964
How long?

06:03.997 --> 06:05.098
Until tomorrow.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.500
(LAUGHS)

06:07.034 --> 06:08.936
Okay, woman of tomorrow.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.942
You always wear this.
It's... It's beautiful.

06:14.975 --> 06:17.010
-You know, it was my mother's.
-Really?

06:17.044 --> 06:19.847
Yeah, she gave it to me
the day I left Krypton.

06:19.880 --> 06:20.981
Hmm.

06:21.014 --> 06:24.051
I had just watched little
Kal-El launch into space.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.888
Our world was falling apart
around her,

06:27.921 --> 06:30.023
and even in the
middle of that,

06:30.057 --> 06:33.761
she looked at me
and smiled and said,

06:33.794 --> 06:36.964
as long as I had this,
I would never be alone.

06:38.766 --> 06:41.001
She'd be with me in my dreams.

Well, you passed out
and then you woke up,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.168
-flew us here

-Ah!

That chessboard's
been in the Luthor family

07:50.137 --> 07:51.972
Did you come here
to yell at me for not treating

07:52.005 --> 07:53.674
the family heirlooms
with respect,

07:53.707 --> 07:55.208
or to blame me
for what's happening outside?

07:55.242 --> 07:58.546
How could you
let that woman deceive you?

07:58.579 --> 08:00.080
I taught you
to be a scientist.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.048
To question everything.

08:01.081 --> 08:04.117
No, what you taught me
was to doubt myself.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.853
To look for
validation elsewhere,

08:05.886 --> 08:07.120
so much that I was willing
to take it from

08:07.154 --> 08:09.823
the first mentor
that offered it to me.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.161
I'm sorry.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.529
(SCOFFS)

08:15.563 --> 08:17.164
I am, Lena.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.738
When you came
to visit me in jail,

08:24.772 --> 08:28.008
I honestly wanted to be
a better mother to you.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.110
But every time
I've had the opportunity

08:30.143 --> 08:32.980
to choose you
over something else...

08:35.983 --> 08:39.119
I've chosen something else.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.754
Well, congratulations
on saying

08:40.788 --> 08:44.024
the first honest thing
in your life.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.727
I have justified
the worst behavior

08:46.760 --> 08:48.228
for the best of causes.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.800
But I was right.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.836
The threat was real.

08:55.869 --> 08:59.940
But maybe I backed
the wrong child to stop it.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.309
The transmat portal
you created...

09:02.342 --> 09:04.612
That was brilliant, Lena.

09:04.645 --> 09:07.881
And if you could do that
with the portal,

09:07.915 --> 09:11.719
maybe you could
do something with this.

09:13.754 --> 09:14.988
Is that from Lex's vault?

09:15.022 --> 09:18.091
He created it
to get rid of Superman.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.360
Does it work?

09:20.393 --> 09:22.162
Well, you'd
need to adapt it.

09:22.195 --> 09:23.096
But if you could,

09:23.130 --> 09:26.700
you would be the Luthor
who saved the world.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.238
Silver Kryptonite.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.741
That's a new one.

09:33.774 --> 09:36.944
The whole time I thought
I was fighting Zod.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.378
But it didn't
weaken me at all.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.680
It might have.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.214
No.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.884
No, I was at full strength
and you beat me.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.387
Well, I'm just glad
we're both okay.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.990
But we need to come up
with a plan to defeat Rhea

09:50.023 --> 09:51.992
or she's just going
to keep coming after us.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.894
The positron cannon
was the only weapon we had

09:53.927 --> 09:56.263
capable of penetrating
their ship's shields.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.866
Is there anything
that powerful here?

09:58.899 --> 10:00.901
Not a weapon.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.936
But I might have something
we can use against them.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.272
-What?
-Information.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.840
I feel like there was
something in the archives

with Daxam.

Uh, we've cleared all Daxamite
soldiers from the building.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.854

rest on the fate of my life.

on Daxam

12:53.540 --> 12:55.142
with rocks and sticks.

12:55.175 --> 12:56.977
If I win, she goes.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.511
They all go.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.513
They are bound by ancient law
to leave this planet in peace.

13:00.547 --> 13:03.483
-She's not gonna win.
-But what if she does?

13:03.516 --> 13:05.585
Do you know
what it will happen?

13:05.618 --> 13:08.288
You'll have to
stand by and watch her
walk this planet,

13:08.321 --> 13:10.123
trampling everyone underfoot.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.825
I just have to beat her.
And I will.

13:11.859 --> 13:15.328
Why not Superman?
Isn't this his fight, too?

13:15.362 --> 13:17.931
SUPERMAN:
It's everyone's fight.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.233
But Kara just defeated me.

13:20.267 --> 13:21.801
She's the champion of Earth.

13:25.272 --> 13:28.842
I don't have time
for you to be afraid.

13:28.876 --> 13:30.477
I need you strong.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.487
Please, J'onn, wake up soon.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.089
We need you.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.997
It's true.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.032
You have to wake up.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.640
M'gann.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.043
Your friends need you, J'onn.

14:03.076 --> 14:06.346
The great fight is coming.

14:06.379 --> 14:09.549
I don't know if I'm gonna be
strong enough to help them.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.885
Don't worry.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.620
Everything will be fine.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.191
Now wake up.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.893
(GASPING)

14:20.627 --> 14:22.129
Oh, thank God.

14:22.930 --> 14:24.898
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

14:24.932 --> 14:26.333
Where's M'gann?

14:26.366 --> 14:27.935
You've been out
for days, J'onn.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.136
You must be a little confused.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.904
She was right here!

14:30.938 --> 14:33.273
No. She's on Mars.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.244
What happened here?

14:37.677 --> 14:39.112
Everything.

14:39.146 --> 14:41.114
REPORTER: (ON TV)
It's being touted
as the intergalactic

14:41.148 --> 14:42.515
fight of the century.

14:42.549 --> 14:46.686
As Supergirl and Rhea of Daxam
face off in a trial by combat

14:46.719 --> 14:49.589
-for the very fate
of our world.
-Woof. No pressure.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.091
We need to contain this.

14:51.124 --> 14:54.227
(GASPS) Hey! Papa Bear!

14:54.261 --> 14:56.096
ALEX: Easy!

14:56.129 --> 14:58.331
-It's good to see you
on your feet.
-Welcome, my friend.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.200
Should you be up
and walking around?

15:00.233 --> 15:01.601
You need all the help
you can get.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.270
Alex told me
about the offer you made.

15:03.303 --> 15:04.938
We'll get you everything
you need.

15:04.972 --> 15:08.241
But for right now,
that needs to be handled.

15:08.275 --> 15:11.911
You don't want an audience
of innocent civilians
when you fight Rhea.

15:13.546 --> 15:17.017
CAT: Tessmacher,
get Snapper on the line.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.418
His dispatches have no teeth.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.287
Where's the hook,
where's the lede,

15:20.320 --> 15:22.422
where's the stats and
where the hell is my latte?

15:22.455 --> 15:23.723
I've been typing
for 12 hours,

15:23.756 --> 15:26.994
I need caffeine, I need carbs,
I need a...

15:27.027 --> 15:28.261
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

15:28.295 --> 15:29.462
Clark Bar.

15:31.164 --> 15:32.299
Oh.

15:35.702 --> 15:41.008
And what, pray tell,
brings you here?

15:41.041 --> 15:43.310
Gosh, Ms. Grant.
I just wanted to see
what I could do to help.

15:43.343 --> 15:46.279
Oh, you do love danger,
don't you, Clark Kent?

15:46.313 --> 15:49.716
Yet another reason
why Lois made no sense.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.353
Oh, and speaking of sense,

15:53.386 --> 15:55.355
I need you to talk some sense

15:55.388 --> 15:58.191
into your friend, James Olsen.

15:58.225 --> 15:59.526
Ah, Jimmy?

15:59.559 --> 16:01.461
He's been parading around
like Darth Vader,

16:01.494 --> 16:03.163
punching out villains,

16:03.196 --> 16:05.698
and, I, for one, do not want
to watch some space invaders

16:05.732 --> 16:08.001
slay him with their
lifesaver.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.536
I think you mean
"light saber".

16:09.569 --> 16:12.205
Yeah, and Darth Vader
actually punches out
the good guys.

16:12.239 --> 16:13.573
Right.

16:13.606 --> 16:16.609
Oh. Okay, whatever.
I've never seen Star Wars.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.779
Oh, and Ker-rah, where
the hell have you been?

16:19.812 --> 16:23.316
No, no, no. You are ostensibly
employed here as a reporter.

16:23.350 --> 16:27.054
And Supergirl is out there
about to have the biggest
skirmish of her career

16:27.087 --> 16:30.023
and I thought maybe you want
to go out there and report?

16:30.057 --> 16:31.558
Yeah, that's actually
why we're here.

16:31.591 --> 16:35.162
So, uh, the fight
between Rhea and Supergirl...

16:35.195 --> 16:36.396
Go on.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.331
Uh, Supergirl gave us
an exclusive interview.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.700
-In exchange for?
-CLARK: A request.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.336
She'd like you
to tone down the, um...

16:43.370 --> 16:45.272
Gee, how do I put this...

16:45.305 --> 16:47.340
The sensational tone that
the battle's been receiving
in the media.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.276
Oh, I don't know
how I can do that.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.578
People are finally
starting to fight.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.280
Finally starting to stand up.

16:53.313 --> 16:56.483
Supergirl doesn't want anyone
showing up and getting hurt.

16:56.516 --> 17:00.287
And I don't know anyone who
cares more about the people
than you do, Ms. Grant.

17:00.320 --> 17:04.291
Once again, Kansas,
you're the only person
who really gets me.

17:04.324 --> 17:05.492
I try.

17:06.293 --> 17:09.196
(SIGHING) Fine. Deal.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.331
And what do you think,
Ker-rah?

17:11.364 --> 17:14.101
Do you think Supergirl
is ready for this?

17:15.568 --> 17:17.570
-She told me she is.
-CAT: Well, great.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.573
Then, I put all my chips
on the Girl of Steel.

17:20.607 --> 17:21.574
Hmm.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.710
Now, you go out there
and you tell Supergirl

17:23.743 --> 17:26.513
that we are all
rooting for her.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.281
Sure thing.
It's good seeing you,
Ms. Grant.

17:28.315 --> 17:29.449
Mmm.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.819
Oh, those big green eyes...

17:32.852 --> 17:35.555
I promise you, when he
takes off those glasses,

17:35.588 --> 17:37.657
he is a tiger in bed.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.659
(CHUCKLES)

17:39.692 --> 17:41.561
Oh, God, I hope Rhea kills me.

17:43.530 --> 17:46.633
Hey, you're never gonna guess
who wants to see us.

17:54.141 --> 17:56.509
Of course, the two of you
would make an entrance.

17:56.543 --> 17:59.179
Unfortunately, this is her
on her best behavior.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.513
So what did you want?

18:00.547 --> 18:03.183
My daughter has
a way to save us.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.852
It's a device that
my brother invented
to keep humans safe

18:05.885 --> 18:08.321
while radiating the atmosphere
with Kryptonite.

18:08.355 --> 18:11.124
It would've made
the planet uninhabitable
for both of you.

18:11.158 --> 18:13.493
(SCOFFS) Well, lucky my cousin
put him in jail

18:13.526 --> 18:15.328
before he could make it work.

18:15.362 --> 18:17.497
And lucky for you, I found it.

18:17.530 --> 18:18.698
I've been studying it.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.133
And I think I can convert it

18:20.167 --> 18:22.202
to irradiate
the atmosphere with lead,

18:22.235 --> 18:23.603
rather than Kryptonite.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.638
LILLIAN: Just a trace amount,
harmless to humans.

18:25.672 --> 18:29.409
But the atmosphere would
become toxic to Daxamites.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.380
The aliens would be
forced to leave.

18:33.413 --> 18:34.747
Or stay and die.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.785
-All of them?
-Mmm-hmm.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.753
LENA:
And they could never return.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.555
Even Rhea's son.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.725
Mon-El would have
to leave Earth.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.162
Did you know he was
dating Kara Danvers?

18:53.566 --> 18:55.368
Start working.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.608
What did Lillian want?

19:01.641 --> 19:05.212
(SIGHS) Lillian and Lena
have a way, a fail-safe,

19:05.245 --> 19:07.880
to get rid of the Daxamites
if Kara doesn't beat Rhea.

19:07.914 --> 19:10.917
It's a device that will seed
the Earth's atmosphere
with lead.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.720
No Daxamite would
survive on this planet.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.957
(STAMMERS)
Except for Mon-El, right?

19:17.990 --> 19:21.261
Mon-El might be able
to survive a little longer
than the others.

19:21.294 --> 19:24.231
He's been exposed
to our yellow sun
for a few months.

19:24.264 --> 19:27.534
Well, if it comes down to it,
you use it.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.702
I won't be the reason
this planet suffers.

19:29.736 --> 19:32.705
No. No, it's not going
to come to that.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.674
I told Lena to start working,

19:34.707 --> 19:37.677
but I want to be
very clear about something.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.812
We will not
have to use that device.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.250
And I am going to beat her.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.586
(SIGHS)
Your mother's going to leave.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.255
For good.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.656
Agent Schott, head to L-Corp.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.558
Assist Lillian
and Lena Luthor.

19:51.591 --> 19:52.892
Yeah, sure thing.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.664
When you go to meet her,
I'm coming, too.

19:57.697 --> 19:58.965
You can't fight for me.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.867
But I can be with you.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.602
I know you probably
want to go, but I...

20:02.635 --> 20:04.237
No.
You'll be a good second.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.840
I could use your
help though, Kal.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.977
Spar with me. And keep me
on my toes until I meet her.

20:13.813 --> 20:16.215
-(GRUNTS)
-That's good, that's good.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.117
You're a quick learner.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.520
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
I learned that move
on Warworld.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.888
(SIGHS)

20:21.921 --> 20:23.523
What is it?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.825
I just...

20:25.858 --> 20:27.760
I feel like I'm on the brink

20:27.794 --> 20:30.597
of having everything
I've ever wanted.

20:30.630 --> 20:33.900
Family, friends, a job I love.

20:33.933 --> 20:37.304
A life as a hero
I never could have imagined.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.773
And Mon-El.

20:40.807 --> 20:43.576
If I beat Rhea,
I get to keep all of that.

20:46.413 --> 20:49.282
I don't know.
I don't know if it's possible.

20:49.316 --> 20:52.685
I don't know if it's possible
to have everything you want.

20:53.520 --> 20:56.289
(CHUCKLES) Well, it is.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.627
But only because
you worked for it.

21:00.660 --> 21:01.961
Whenever I fight,

21:01.994 --> 21:04.864
no matter who it's against
or where it is,

21:04.897 --> 21:07.567
I'm always fighting for Lois.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.569
I fight with her right here.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.571
The people we love,
they're, uh...

21:11.604 --> 21:13.973
They're another
secret superpower.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.310
Keep him with you.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.389
It's time.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.431
(SIGHS)

21:39.131 --> 21:40.700
I'm here for you.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.002
I know.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.843
I see you brought
some moral support.

21:50.877 --> 21:53.713
SUPERGIRL: I see you did, too.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.483
So, once you are disposed of,

21:56.516 --> 21:57.717
I have your word

21:57.750 --> 21:59.652
that your forces
will lay down arms?

21:59.686 --> 22:03.623
That the city, the nation,
and the planet
will be surrendered?

22:03.656 --> 22:06.125
On my honor.

22:06.158 --> 22:09.095
And if I defeat you,
your invasion ends.

22:09.128 --> 22:11.998
You leave.
Once and for all.

22:27.447 --> 22:28.815
For the Earth.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.349
For the Earth.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.089

(GRUNTING)

23:09.489 --> 23:10.523
(GROANS)

23:23.703 --> 23:25.505
You agreed to the Dakkam Ur.

23:25.538 --> 23:26.806
Send them back.

23:26.839 --> 23:29.108
You will dishonor yourself
before the gods.

23:29.141 --> 23:31.844
My gods are only
concerned with my victory.

23:31.878 --> 23:33.480
(EXPLOSION)

23:33.513 --> 23:34.380
SUPERGIRL: No.

23:34.413 --> 23:37.216
No, destroying this city
is not the answer.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.951
A city that's destroyed

23:38.985 --> 23:41.521
will need a new leader
to rebuild it.

23:43.155 --> 23:44.156
Go.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.193
Be a hero.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.502
Kara's alone.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.638
Supergirl's handling Rhea.

23:58.671 --> 24:01.508
Right now, we need to help
the people in that building.

24:01.541 --> 24:02.609
We?

Alex, you're in charge.

Don't worry, I got your back.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.593
You're getting tired.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.962
Finish me, then.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.031
Hit me.

24:25.064 --> 24:26.866
Consider it a gift.

(GRUNTS)

24:31.170 --> 24:33.205
You ready to give up now?

24:35.842 --> 24:37.143
Hardly.

24:39.779 --> 24:43.883
Because of your people,
Kryptonite poisoned
my entire world.

24:44.784 --> 24:47.820

39:11.950 --> 39:14.553
Actually, um...

39:14.586 --> 39:17.022
There's something
I forgot I had to do.

39:17.055 --> 39:18.056
I have to go.

39:18.089 --> 39:19.625
By all means.

39:21.092 --> 39:22.594
Thank you.

39:26.732 --> 39:28.767
Go get 'em, Supergirl.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.737
(BABY CRYING)

41:27.986 --> 41:29.721
Is it ready?

41:31.056 --> 41:33.191
It should survive the journey.

41:34.059 --> 41:37.062
It will grow strong on Earth.

41:37.095 --> 41:38.897
And then what?

41:38.930 --> 41:40.231
And then...

41:40.265 --> 41:43.268
It will reign.
