WEBVTT

00:10.541 --> 00:14.626
Not bad for a queen who's supposedly
been dead for a few thousand years.

00:36.786 --> 00:39.595
Geez, you scared the
hell out of me, Erik.

00:39.619 --> 00:41.254
You ever hear of knocking?

00:41.426 --> 00:44.537
Oh, Custer's Last Stand. Cute.

00:44.561 --> 00:46.688
By the way, the party doesn't
start for another hour.

00:46.712 --> 00:47.911
Sarah...

00:49.131 --> 00:50.392
Erik?

01:59.716 --> 02:01.553
You're not planning on
leaving early, are you?

02:01.577 --> 02:03.092
And if I am?

02:03.645 --> 02:05.371
I wouldn't advise it.

02:06.114 --> 02:07.383
You know what today is?

02:07.407 --> 02:08.550
Tuesday.

02:08.633 --> 02:10.321
It's Halloween, Ziva.

02:10.345 --> 02:14.672
- It's an American holiday...
- I know, the wearing of silly outfits and begging for treats.

02:14.696 --> 02:17.729
I imagine it would be a
DiNozzo national holiday.

02:18.434 --> 02:20.663
Well, you imagine wrong.
I don't do Halloween.

02:20.687 --> 02:22.149
I see.

02:22.377 --> 02:23.781
Your father again, yes?

02:23.805 --> 02:26.962
I don't do Halloween because
ever since I became a cop

02:27.104 --> 02:29.862
weird things always
happen on October 31th.

02:29.886 --> 02:31.273
Define weird.

02:31.297 --> 02:34.391
Brave robberies, beheadings,

02:34.415 --> 02:36.581
cattle mutilations

02:36.915 --> 02:39.639
and McGee turning fuzzy and blue.

02:41.287 --> 02:42.201
What?

02:42.225 --> 02:43.819
What's under your shirt?

02:45.274 --> 02:46.412
My T-shirt.

02:46.436 --> 02:47.463
Okay, he's lying.

02:47.487 --> 02:48.809
Oh, yeah.

02:49.247 --> 02:50.752
Oh, yeah.

02:57.185 --> 02:59.961
I knew you played a
fairy on that online game,

02:59.985 --> 03:01.669
but dressing up as one?

03:01.986 --> 03:05.430
It's a snow elf. And I'm
going to a costume party, okay?

03:05.454 --> 03:07.892
It's far from okay, Probie.

03:08.166 --> 03:09.983
In fact, I'd say that this is...

03:10.007 --> 03:12.091
taking geek one step beyond.

03:12.115 --> 03:14.533
Oh, sadly, I have to agree.

03:14.557 --> 03:20.282
I instantly felt all the respect
leave my body as soon as I put this on.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.770
Well, normally you'd be right, but...

03:22.794 --> 03:25.261
you haven't yet met my ice queen.

03:25.285 --> 03:27.871
You have to be kidding me.

03:31.764 --> 03:34.490
Did I also mention that
she's a Redskins cheerleader?

03:34.745 --> 03:35.652
Very impressive.

03:35.676 --> 03:38.110
She's a very hot woman.
How'd you find her?

03:38.134 --> 03:39.720
Met at the Armani store.

03:39.744 --> 03:42.213
Found out we played on the
same gaming server together.

03:42.237 --> 03:44.320
Since when can you afford Armani?

03:45.185 --> 03:46.560
Gear up.

03:53.927 --> 03:55.240
Oh, God.

03:55.624 --> 03:57.200
They're McGee's.

03:57.964 --> 04:00.552
I'm going to a costume
party later tonight.

04:02.067 --> 04:03.811
Not anymore, Elf Lord.

04:03.835 --> 04:07.742
General Custer has been shot, and he
has a dead skeleton in his living room.

04:07.766 --> 04:09.629
What did I tell you? Halloween.

04:13.205 --> 04:15.201
No, wait, wait, wait, Sharon, it's...

04:15.375 --> 04:17.329
Well, what about next weekend?

04:17.464 --> 04:18.952
Look, it's not my fault.

04:18.976 --> 04:21.300
Oh, my poor little McGee.

04:21.324 --> 04:23.691
There'll be other elf queens online.

04:23.715 --> 04:24.972
She's right.

04:25.097 --> 04:28.643
Of course they won't be Redskins cheerleaders
and they'll probably weigh a few thousand pounds.

04:28.667 --> 04:31.183
Not to mention there's a good
chance some of them are actually men.

04:31.207 --> 04:32.422
But you play long enough...

04:32.446 --> 04:33.772
Anything can happen.

04:33.796 --> 04:36.412
Guy dressed as Custer is
Staff Sergeant Erik Niles.

04:36.436 --> 04:38.743
LEOs are looking for
his wife and daughter.

04:38.767 --> 04:42.660
Blood trail leads from his house to
the neighbour's house who called it in.

04:42.684 --> 04:44.433
Tony, Ziva, get her statement.

04:44.457 --> 04:47.112
McGee, start processing the
Staff Sergeant's living room.

04:47.136 --> 04:48.779
Oh, and there's a, uh...

04:48.805 --> 04:51.571
dead John Doe in there
dressed like a skeleton.

04:54.454 --> 04:56.101
What happened to them?

04:56.174 --> 04:56.940
Halloween.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.579
Sorry we're late,

04:58.604 --> 05:01.352
only we had a minor run-in
with some local youths.

05:01.376 --> 05:03.570
Yeah, I can see that, Doctor.

05:03.594 --> 05:04.670
Did you get a good look at them?

05:04.694 --> 05:06.271
We did better than that.

05:06.295 --> 05:08.711
Release the captives, Mr. Palmer.

05:09.407 --> 05:10.793
Are we in trouble?

05:10.817 --> 05:12.120
Where we at?

05:12.175 --> 05:13.472
We said we were sorry.

05:13.496 --> 05:14.791
Right.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.012
Clean it.

05:17.036 --> 05:17.980
Nice work, Palmer.

05:18.004 --> 05:19.212
It wasn't me, Tony.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.821
Dr. Mallard chased
them for three blocks.

05:21.845 --> 05:24.901
Oh, please, it's not that impressive.

05:24.966 --> 05:27.392
It's not as if they were real ninjas.

05:32.285 --> 05:34.979
I thought he was play-acting at first.

05:35.156 --> 05:37.263
General Custer's Last Stand, all that?

05:37.287 --> 05:39.103
You removed his jacket. Why?

05:39.127 --> 05:40.580
To check for other wounds.

05:40.604 --> 05:41.662
There weren't any.

05:41.686 --> 05:44.330
Just a single gunshot wound
that nicked his carotid artery.

05:44.354 --> 05:46.801
I'm a doctor, paediatrician.

05:46.825 --> 05:47.610
Oh...

05:47.634 --> 05:51.563
Oh, that explains why he headed over
here. You probably saved his life, Doctor.

05:51.587 --> 05:55.099
I stabilized him the best I
could until the EMTs arrived.

05:55.304 --> 05:57.611
And it's Leslie.

06:00.217 --> 06:01.959
Did he say anything to you?

06:02.287 --> 06:05.560
He was trying to. I think
it was his daughter's name

06:05.584 --> 06:06.700
Sarah.

06:06.724 --> 06:09.982
I'm hoping she was with
her mother when this...

06:10.484 --> 06:12.891
this happened.

06:23.224 --> 06:24.949
No, that's not creepy.

07:00.355 --> 07:01.322
Palmer!

07:01.346 --> 07:02.651
Is something wrong?

07:02.675 --> 07:04.042
You trying to get shot?

07:04.066 --> 07:05.580
Um, no.

07:07.314 --> 07:08.841
There's someone in this room.

07:08.907 --> 07:11.249
You mean besides the dead skeleton guy?

07:11.435 --> 07:13.971
Yes, besides the dead skeleton guy.

07:18.264 --> 07:20.112
Basement's clear, boss.

07:20.166 --> 07:21.082
Look, I know what I saw.

07:21.106 --> 07:23.450
Someone policed the brass
tried to wipe up the blood.

07:23.474 --> 07:26.098
Who, Probie, the crime scene
fairies? There's no one here.

07:26.122 --> 07:28.383
Get Ducky in here. We're wasting time.

07:28.606 --> 07:30.680
Boss, I'm sorry, but I swear, there...

07:30.715 --> 07:32.770
What do you make of this, McGee?

07:33.908 --> 07:35.731
Well, obviously signs of a struggle.

07:35.755 --> 07:38.273
One dead assailant. Not really sure
how his head got that way, though.

07:38.297 --> 07:39.420
You're not?

07:40.107 --> 07:42.330
Come on, let me show
you. Get on the floor.

07:42.635 --> 07:45.271
Well, Tony did tell me about when
you demonstrated this technique...

07:45.295 --> 07:47.642
Yeah, you guys talk
about things like that?

07:47.666 --> 07:49.221
You learn by feeling, McGee.

07:49.245 --> 07:51.981
This is how marines
silence enemy sentries.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.233
66 pounds of pressure and then...

07:54.257 --> 07:55.802
Snap!

07:56.457 --> 07:59.281
So Staff Sergeant Niles
went down fighting.

07:59.766 --> 08:01.040
See?

08:01.415 --> 08:03.422
The blood spatter on the wall.

08:07.385 --> 08:09.863
He was right about where I am now

08:09.887 --> 08:11.369
when he got shot.

08:11.586 --> 08:13.361
Bullet impacted...

08:14.327 --> 08:16.559
means the shooter was
over here somewhere.

08:16.755 --> 08:19.062
This is where the brass is.

08:19.086 --> 08:20.371
Well, was.

08:20.777 --> 08:22.941
- So two assailants.
- At least.

08:22.994 --> 08:25.351
Yes, the cause of
death is pretty obvious.

08:25.375 --> 08:26.913
But you never know.

08:26.937 --> 08:31.350
I once had a case where a
man who died of heart failure

08:31.374 --> 08:33.111
had an ice pick

08:33.135 --> 08:37.462
plunged into his skull four
hours after the time of death.

08:37.486 --> 08:40.809
His wife discovered that she
had been left out of his will.

08:40.833 --> 08:41.580
Good news, boss.

08:41.604 --> 08:44.070
A kid saw a car leaving the sergeant's
house around the time of the shooting.

08:44.094 --> 08:45.363
Ziva's getting a description.

08:45.387 --> 08:48.679
Well, let's have a look at you.

08:50.444 --> 08:51.552
Whoa!

08:52.045 --> 08:53.790
Something just touched my foot.

08:54.165 --> 08:55.789
Something's under the couch.

08:56.016 --> 08:58.529
Maybe it's the, uh,
crime scene fairy, Tony.

09:02.127 --> 09:04.019
I hate Halloween.

09:12.737 --> 09:14.033
Hey, it's a Roomba.

09:14.057 --> 09:15.503
It's a robot vacuum cleaner,

09:15.527 --> 09:18.242
uses navigational sensors to clean
the floor while the owner's away.

09:18.266 --> 09:21.982
Yes, well, your Roomba is about
to interfere with your crime scene.

09:28.386 --> 09:30.570
Damn thing policed the brass.

09:30.827 --> 09:32.600
Told you I wasn't crazy.

09:33.837 --> 09:34.939
Bag it.

09:40.637 --> 09:42.261
I think it was a silver Kuruma.

09:42.285 --> 09:44.922
The door slammed and he just drove away.

09:45.395 --> 09:46.590
Thanks a lot.

09:52.614 --> 09:55.143
The boy saw a car leaving the
scene that looked like a Kuruma.

09:55.167 --> 09:57.251
I'm not familiar with the model.

09:57.606 --> 10:00.151
Kuruma is Japanese for car, Ziva.

10:00.175 --> 10:02.632
Your description of the car is car.

10:02.656 --> 10:03.971
Nice work, Officer David.

10:03.995 --> 10:06.582
Kuruma's the name of a car
in Grand Theft Auto Three.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.790
It's a Chrysler Sebring sedan.

10:08.814 --> 10:10.811
McGeek with the save.

10:10.835 --> 10:12.181
I'll put out a BOLO.

10:12.205 --> 10:13.553
Find the Staff Sergeant's wife and...

10:13.577 --> 10:14.621
Erik.

10:17.057 --> 10:18.229
Oh, my God.

10:18.584 --> 10:20.661
Is-is that...

10:20.774 --> 10:22.341
Is that... is that my...

10:22.365 --> 10:24.111
- Is that my husband in there?
- It's not him.

10:24.135 --> 10:27.372
That's not your husband.
It's not your husband.

10:28.184 --> 10:29.211
Okay?

10:30.485 --> 10:31.549
I'm her sister.

10:31.654 --> 10:35.491
We were at the school helping set up for
the Halloween party when the police came.

10:35.515 --> 10:37.122
Is her daughter still there?

10:37.146 --> 10:39.660
Sarah? She was with Erik.

10:39.684 --> 10:41.462
Amber Alert, on it, Boss.

10:47.834 --> 10:49.320
I'm okay now.

10:50.214 --> 10:53.522
When they said Erik was shot
and I saw that body, I...

10:54.877 --> 10:58.833
Mrs. Niles, your husband's at
Bethesda Hospital. He's in surgery.

10:58.857 --> 11:00.389
And we'll take you to see him.

11:00.725 --> 11:02.609
Just need to ask you a few questions.

11:02.654 --> 11:03.772
Laurie...

11:04.644 --> 11:06.039
Sarah's missing.

11:06.124 --> 11:07.530
You mean she's been kidnapped.

11:07.554 --> 11:09.062
They don't know that for sure yet.

11:09.086 --> 11:11.702
Mrs. Niles, your daughter may have
just become scared and run off.

11:11.726 --> 11:14.781
Perhaps there's a friend or
relative's house she would go to?

11:14.805 --> 11:16.580
No, no, she...

11:16.604 --> 11:19.280
she would have called
me on my cell phone.

11:19.786 --> 11:20.932
They took my little girl.

11:20.956 --> 11:24.552
They'll find her, Laurie, we
just have to stay positive, okay?

11:26.015 --> 11:28.061
That could be her right now.

11:28.915 --> 11:30.861
Do you mind putting that on speaker?

11:32.976 --> 11:33.702
Hello?

11:33.726 --> 11:35.260
Mommy!

11:35.366 --> 11:36.760
Baby, are you okay?

11:36.784 --> 11:38.340
They hurt Daddy.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.810
I tried to call the
police, but the man...

11:40.834 --> 11:42.432
Listen to me, Sarah.

11:42.456 --> 11:44.860
Everything is going to be
all right. You just need to...

11:44.884 --> 11:46.319
We have your daughter.

11:46.687 --> 11:49.992
You want to see her alive again,
you'll do exactly what I say.

11:50.016 --> 11:51.972
I'll call back with instructions.

12:05.056 --> 12:07.900
I dressed up as a
skeleton once in my youth.

12:07.924 --> 12:13.053
Did you know that the tradition of
Halloween was brought over from Scotland?

12:13.077 --> 12:17.773
Along with the fine
sports of golf and curling.

12:17.797 --> 12:20.531
I wouldn't call anything
using a broom a sport, Ducky.

12:20.555 --> 12:24.763
Tony, curling is referred
to as chess on ice,

12:24.787 --> 12:29.771
because it puts high demands
on tactics and foresight.

12:29.795 --> 12:32.031
Relax, Ducky, I love Scotland.

12:32.055 --> 12:33.213
Sean Connery-

12:33.237 --> 12:35.670
the very best James Bond ever.

12:36.077 --> 12:37.510
I thought he was Irish.

12:38.247 --> 12:41.221
Uh, Darby O'Gill and the Little People.

12:41.245 --> 12:44.329
He was using a fake Irish
accent; It's called acting.

12:44.737 --> 12:48.600
The preliminary cause of death
is blunt-force trauma to the neck.

12:48.624 --> 12:50.822
However, once I've done the...

12:50.846 --> 12:53.372
This guy's our only
link to the missing girl.

12:53.396 --> 12:54.730
I need an ID.

12:54.754 --> 12:57.323
Well, currently, he remains a John Doe.

12:57.347 --> 13:00.050
He had no ID, he has no tattoos,

13:00.074 --> 13:02.302
no distinguishing marks. Here.

13:02.326 --> 13:03.851
What about his prints?

13:03.875 --> 13:06.813
Mr. Palmer took them up to Abby's lab,

13:06.837 --> 13:10.051
although she's not there, and
she's not answering her calls.

13:10.075 --> 13:11.923
Halloween's a pretty big night for Abby.

13:11.947 --> 13:13.930
Every night is Halloween to Abby.

13:14.025 --> 13:16.921
Ah, there you are. Is she here yet?

13:16.945 --> 13:17.901
Oh, she's here.

13:17.925 --> 13:19.460
And she is in costume.

13:19.484 --> 13:22.119
Oh, yeah? What's it like?

13:22.256 --> 13:25.452
Trust me, you wouldn't want
me to ruin the surprise.

13:40.955 --> 13:42.852
Oh, sorry I was late, you guys.

13:42.876 --> 13:44.921
I couldn't hear my cell
phone ringing at the party.

13:44.945 --> 13:47.012
You'd think a cemetery
would be a little quieter.

13:47.036 --> 13:48.843
It's awful about that little girl.

13:48.867 --> 13:50.531
I mean, getting kidnapped on Halloween.

13:50.555 --> 13:52.150
Totally creepy.

13:52.884 --> 13:55.240
I'm running our skeleton's
fingerprints through AFIS.

13:55.264 --> 13:56.921
I'm starting with Virginia and Maryland

13:56.945 --> 14:00.213
and then a subset of all known
child molesters on the East Coast.

14:00.237 --> 14:03.221
Got an Amber Alert running, no hits yet.

14:04.486 --> 14:06.261
We've got to find her.

14:07.637 --> 14:09.442
Why are you looking at me like that?

14:09.466 --> 14:11.502
Do I have food in my teeth or something?

14:13.137 --> 14:15.761
I'll just stick with "or something."

14:15.846 --> 14:19.111
Need to run our dead guy's
photo against mug shots.

14:23.046 --> 14:24.251
Give me.

14:27.606 --> 14:29.623
The camera, McGee.

14:29.647 --> 14:31.439
The camera. Sorry.

14:37.375 --> 14:39.701
We need to put out a BOLO.

14:40.177 --> 14:43.180
See if anyone recognizes our guy.

14:43.265 --> 14:45.503
McGee, what is wrong with you?

14:45.527 --> 14:47.881
You look three cans
short of a six-pack.

14:47.905 --> 14:50.031
Nothing, it's just you...

14:50.055 --> 14:51.791
you look different.

14:51.997 --> 14:54.872
He means the Halloween costume, Marilyn.

14:55.136 --> 14:56.359
Oh...

14:56.866 --> 14:57.753
right.

14:57.777 --> 14:58.631
Sweet, huh?

14:58.655 --> 15:00.209
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:03.085 --> 15:04.102
DiNozzo.

15:04.126 --> 15:06.243
Woodbridge P.D. has a kid who says

15:06.267 --> 15:08.413
he may have seen the
Sebring in the neighbourhood.

15:08.437 --> 15:09.992
Okay, on it.

15:10.016 --> 15:12.443
We also got a picture of our
skeleton without the makeup.

15:12.467 --> 15:13.453
Send them.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.521
See if I can get the wife to ID him.

15:16.055 --> 15:17.802
What's the condition
of the staff sergeant?

15:17.826 --> 15:19.620
Still in surgery.
According to the doctors,

15:19.644 --> 15:21.563
we won't be able to
interview him until tomorrow.

15:21.587 --> 15:22.953
Tomorrow's too late.

15:22.977 --> 15:24.029
Yeah.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.360
Kidnappers call back yet?

15:25.384 --> 15:27.950
Nope, but it makes me wonder.

15:27.974 --> 15:29.431
If she's still alive?

15:29.455 --> 15:30.421
No.

15:30.445 --> 15:33.651
At they want with an enlisted
Marine who makes less than

15:33.675 --> 15:35.551
$32,000 a year.

15:35.575 --> 15:37.710
Yeah, I was kind of
wondering the same thing.

15:37.776 --> 15:39.012
Find out.

15:41.047 --> 15:43.089
How long do I have to sit here?

15:43.574 --> 15:46.650
They're doing everything
they can for us, Laurie.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.580
You must try to stay calm.

15:48.604 --> 15:50.269
That's easy for you to say.

15:50.657 --> 15:52.943
Do you have children, Officer David?

15:52.967 --> 15:56.182
No. But I know what it's like
to lose a member of my family.

15:58.986 --> 15:59.953
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

15:59.977 --> 16:02.242
Nice. Thank you.

16:02.454 --> 16:03.880
Sarah will be fine.

16:03.904 --> 16:06.282
Laurie, you have to believe that.

16:07.016 --> 16:08.830
Our skeleton, John Doe.

16:14.225 --> 16:15.523
She recognize him?

16:15.547 --> 16:17.083
I haven't showed it to her yet.

16:17.107 --> 16:18.640
Apparently, everything
I say makes her cry.

16:18.664 --> 16:19.831
Ziva...

16:20.477 --> 16:22.292
her husband is in critical condition.

16:22.316 --> 16:23.680
Her daughter's been kidnapped.

16:23.704 --> 16:26.270
I know, I'm just not very good
with the crying and the women and...

16:26.294 --> 16:28.130
That makes two of us.

16:28.934 --> 16:31.112
I also believe she's hiding something.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.192
She seems conflicted,

16:33.316 --> 16:34.120
Like...

16:34.144 --> 16:35.451
like she's holding something back.

16:35.475 --> 16:37.372
I'll show you something.

16:39.117 --> 16:40.610
One shirt.

16:41.886 --> 16:44.160
Our staff sergeant wasn't living here.

16:45.556 --> 16:46.800
That a question or a statement?

16:46.824 --> 16:48.232
Actually, more of a...

16:48.256 --> 16:50.191
You want me to find out why.

16:52.945 --> 16:56.060
You saw the Sebring driving that way?

16:56.084 --> 16:58.133
No, no.

16:58.157 --> 17:00.133
What? Is that German?

17:00.157 --> 17:01.552
Are you speaking
Ger-Is that German?

17:01.576 --> 17:02.800
No.

17:05.574 --> 17:07.722
I think he's saying "two people."

17:08.736 --> 17:10.262
Two people where?

17:12.636 --> 17:13.819
What is that, a manhole cover?

17:13.844 --> 17:16.980
They're moving a manhole
cover? What is that, a rake?

17:18.384 --> 17:20.540
Yeah, no, he's just saying
you're bad at charades.

17:20.564 --> 17:22.262
All right, screw this.

17:23.244 --> 17:25.021
Dude, you ruined my costume!

17:25.045 --> 17:27.622
You want to be charged with
obstructing a federal investigation?

17:29.335 --> 17:31.371
Then speak, zombie.

17:31.395 --> 17:31.821
Okay, look,

17:31.845 --> 17:32.811
I- I saw a Sebring, all right?

17:32.835 --> 17:34.871
And I think there were two people in it.

17:35.335 --> 17:36.793
Which way did it go?

17:36.817 --> 17:37.751
That way.

17:37.775 --> 17:40.883
Yeah, it cut the corner so
hard, it ran over the curb.

17:40.907 --> 17:42.629
All right, show me.

17:45.885 --> 17:47.563
Don't be a wise guy.

17:47.587 --> 17:48.422
Okay, okay, look,

17:48.446 --> 17:52.092
it crashed into all that stuff,
right? And then it drove off that way.

17:52.116 --> 17:53.353
You get a look at the license plate?

17:53.377 --> 17:56.539
Dude, I can barely see you
two with all this makeup on.

18:01.476 --> 18:02.732
Thank you.

18:11.937 --> 18:15.410
You got a time of death on the
Great Pumpkin here, Charlie Brown?

18:16.476 --> 18:18.183
I might have more than that.

18:18.207 --> 18:20.369
The car left an impression on it.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.932
This is the guy that was
fighting with your husband.

18:28.956 --> 18:31.442
Sorry, Agent Gibbs,
I don't recognize him.

18:31.466 --> 18:34.173
Think, Laurie. Maybe you saw
him at a store or the mall.

18:34.197 --> 18:35.909
I said I don't know him!

18:37.086 --> 18:38.919
Can I talk to Erik?

18:39.695 --> 18:41.433
Sure. He's still in surgery.

18:41.457 --> 18:43.691
When he gets out, we'll put
him on the phone with you.

18:44.567 --> 18:47.040
It's gonna be all right.
We need to have faith.

18:47.064 --> 18:48.930
Stop touching me!

19:13.184 --> 19:14.784
I know what you're
going through, Laurie.

19:15.387 --> 19:16.721
I know...

19:19.414 --> 19:20.623
I know there's nothing I can say...

19:20.647 --> 19:22.870
Have you ever had a daughter kidnapped?

19:27.125 --> 19:28.572
Kidnapped, no.

19:30.436 --> 19:32.393
I promise to do everything I can do

19:32.417 --> 19:34.591
to bring your daughter home safe.

19:36.587 --> 19:38.521
I believe you, Agent Gibbs.

19:39.747 --> 19:41.839
I just hope it'll be enough.

19:52.476 --> 19:54.143
Dawn of the Dead was awesome.

19:54.167 --> 19:56.053
Cinematic blasphemy.

19:56.077 --> 19:59.133
Fast zombies? There's a reason
you don't remake classics.

19:59.157 --> 20:01.161
John Carpenter's The Thing.

20:01.185 --> 20:03.413
Well, there's an
exception to every rule.

20:03.437 --> 20:04.512
The Fly.

20:04.536 --> 20:05.580
Maybe two.

20:05.604 --> 20:07.711
Didn't you say that Al Pacino
in Scarface was the best...

20:07.735 --> 20:10.152
Okay, but my point is:

20:10.176 --> 20:11.740
Zombies should be slow.

20:11.764 --> 20:15.661
Tony, there's nothing scary about
a zombie dragging his butt around.

20:15.685 --> 20:18.843
Well, a zombie's not a zombie
unless it's dragging its butt around.

20:18.867 --> 20:22.203
You liked 28 Days Later. Those
zombies were really quick.

20:22.227 --> 20:25.541
Okay, enough with the zombies already!

20:25.565 --> 20:27.873
We find an impression
on the vegetable or not?

20:27.897 --> 20:29.291
Technically, it's a fruit.

20:29.315 --> 20:33.123
We're finished rendering the laser
scan of the Great Pumpkin's surface.

20:33.147 --> 20:35.742
McGee, can you invert the image?

20:35.766 --> 20:38.190
As soon as you're done
undressing me with your eyes.

20:39.597 --> 20:42.161
And bring up the gamma.

20:42.286 --> 20:44.062
And increase the contrast.

20:44.214 --> 20:45.962
And flop it.

20:46.796 --> 20:47.711
Smashing pumpkins!

20:47.735 --> 20:50.022
It's the left-hand side of
a Virginia license plate.

20:50.046 --> 20:52.490
Nice work, Abs. Run it, McGee!

20:52.514 --> 20:56.322
First four letters, cross-referencing
against Chrysler Sebrings.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.301
And we got a hit.

20:59.684 --> 21:04.241
Car was registered to a rental
car company in Catlett, Virginia.

21:04.265 --> 21:06.661
Yes! DiNozzo does it again.

21:06.685 --> 21:09.030
I think you mean Abby
and I did it again.

21:09.486 --> 21:10.931
What's that for?

21:10.955 --> 21:11.981
Those days ended

21:12.005 --> 21:14.842
the moment you started
sexing up the cheerleader.

21:14.866 --> 21:18.470
All right, find out who rented that
car. I'm about to make Gibbs' night.

21:18.494 --> 21:20.450
Uh, wait a second, Tony.

21:20.474 --> 21:22.091
There is no name.

21:22.115 --> 21:24.520
Car was reported stolen three days ago.

21:26.585 --> 21:30.730
Our staff sergeant moved into the Quantico
Bachelor Enlisted Quarters three weeks ago.

21:30.754 --> 21:31.762
Marital problems?

21:31.786 --> 21:34.792
Well, according to
someone called "Scuttle...

21:34.816 --> 21:37.452
butt", he caught his
wife cheating on him.

21:37.476 --> 21:39.730
Scuttlebutt's not a person, Ziva.

21:39.754 --> 21:42.572
Scuttlebutt is what Marines call gossip.

21:42.596 --> 21:45.561
And then you wonder why I have
a problem with your language.

21:49.087 --> 21:50.933
Okay, stay calm.

21:50.957 --> 21:52.781
Tell him you want to talk to Sarah.

21:53.044 --> 21:54.403
Can you do that for me, Laurie?

21:54.427 --> 21:55.831
Okay.

22:00.205 --> 22:01.130
Sarah?

22:01.154 --> 22:02.501
Try again.

22:02.525 --> 22:05.732
I want to talk to my daughter
right now or I'm, I'm hanging up.

22:05.756 --> 22:08.160
Hang up and she dies, Mrs. Niles.

22:12.856 --> 22:14.770
I want to talk to her right now.

22:14.816 --> 22:16.200
Talk is cheap.

22:16.254 --> 22:18.122
If you want to see her alive again,

22:18.146 --> 22:19.380
that'll cost.

22:19.404 --> 22:22.892
Whatever it is, whatever
you want, I'll do it.

22:23.044 --> 22:24.660
I- I give you my word.

22:24.684 --> 22:27.012
$100000 in small bills.

22:27.376 --> 22:29.410
You have until dawn to get it.

22:29.444 --> 22:31.191
Yes, okay, now...

22:31.215 --> 22:33.483
now just please let
me talk to my daughter.

22:33.507 --> 22:36.630
Money first, then you can talk.

22:42.584 --> 22:44.321
Scared, little darling?

22:45.687 --> 22:46.872
Good.

22:47.814 --> 22:49.201
You should be.

23:02.091 --> 23:04.028
Call wasn't long enough to trace.

23:04.052 --> 23:08.236
We'll get another chance when he calls her
back to tell her where to drop off the ransom.

23:08.260 --> 23:09.417
Laurie...

23:10.550 --> 23:12.194
I'd like to talk to you...

23:12.401 --> 23:13.567
alone.

23:14.121 --> 23:15.306
It's okay, honey.

23:15.330 --> 23:18.726
I'll be right here if you need
me. I'm not going anywhere.

23:25.920 --> 23:29.256
Tell DiNozzo I want that
John Doe ID'd in an hour.

23:32.329 --> 23:36.856
We don't have a hundred thousand dollars
sitting in the basement, Agent Gibbs.

23:37.960 --> 23:41.788
Maybe my parents can get it,
but it's going to take time.

23:41.812 --> 23:43.586
Yeah, we can help you with that.

23:44.031 --> 23:45.458
But I need some answers first.

23:45.482 --> 23:47.435
- Anything.
- Sit down.

23:51.910 --> 23:56.457
So, Laurie, why did your husband
move out of your house and onto base?

23:56.481 --> 23:57.728
What does that have to do with this?

23:57.752 --> 24:00.196
Maybe nothing, but I need to know.

24:03.749 --> 24:05.687
We were having some problems.

24:05.902 --> 24:08.464
Erik wanted a trial separation.

24:10.010 --> 24:11.010
Why?

24:12.380 --> 24:13.985
I made a mistake.

24:14.219 --> 24:17.377
A stupid mistake eight years ago.

24:17.992 --> 24:19.694
What kind of mistake?

24:21.611 --> 24:23.035
Laurie, look,

24:23.231 --> 24:25.304
I've been married four times.

24:25.829 --> 24:28.164
I've made every mistake in the book.

24:31.051 --> 24:33.048
Right before we were married,

24:33.072 --> 24:34.607
Erik, he...

24:34.631 --> 24:37.665
he broke off our
engagement for a few weeks.

24:38.192 --> 24:40.294
I saw an old boyfriend.

24:40.581 --> 24:43.885
It was a stupid fling. I
pretended it never happened.

24:43.909 --> 24:46.145
Erik's not your daughter's
biological father?

24:46.169 --> 24:47.357
I don't know.

24:47.381 --> 24:49.787
But even if I did, it doesn't matter.

24:49.999 --> 24:51.906
How'd you husband find out?

24:52.292 --> 24:53.657
My ex-boyfriend,

24:53.681 --> 24:58.505
last month, he showed up and
demanded Sarah take a paternity test.

24:59.392 --> 25:01.564
When I refused, he threatened me.

25:02.402 --> 25:04.514
And his name? Address?

25:04.610 --> 25:06.266
Robert Miller.

25:06.842 --> 25:08.757
I have no idea what his address his.

25:08.781 --> 25:09.668
He live in Virginia?

25:09.692 --> 25:11.746
- Used to.
- Age,

25:11.862 --> 25:14.018
weight, eye and hair color?

25:14.042 --> 25:15.884
We can run him down through DMV.

25:16.279 --> 25:18.257
He's 28 years old.

25:19.311 --> 25:21.367
Brown hair, green eyes.

25:21.391 --> 25:23.666
Maybe 180 pounds.

25:33.851 --> 25:35.077
Hey, Laurie,

25:35.101 --> 25:37.154
what aren't you telling me?

25:39.042 --> 25:40.984
It's my fault.

25:41.542 --> 25:43.495
- I, I...
- Laurie?

25:44.371 --> 25:45.945
You okay in here?

25:48.130 --> 25:49.594
No...

25:50.922 --> 25:53.576
I destroyed my family.

25:53.600 --> 25:56.346
Don't you think she's been
through enough already?

25:56.790 --> 25:58.327
Could Miller have done this?

25:58.351 --> 26:00.096
Maybe, I...

26:00.120 --> 26:01.846
I don't know.

26:02.052 --> 26:04.956
I just want my baby back.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.588
She's just telling you this now?

26:09.612 --> 26:12.867
Just because I'm a woman doesn't
mean she'd tell me everything, Tony.

26:12.891 --> 26:16.377
Robert Miller-there's over 300
listed in the tri-state area alone.

26:16.401 --> 26:19.146
Narrow the search with
the criteria, Probie.

26:22.001 --> 26:24.525
Still over a hundred
Robert Millers listed.

26:24.980 --> 26:27.305
We've got her cell phone records, right?

26:27.499 --> 26:28.815
When we tapp her lines.

26:28.839 --> 26:31.807
So check to see if Robert
Miller called in the last month.

26:32.071 --> 26:34.536
Abby's right, I am three
beers short of a six-pack.

26:34.560 --> 26:37.176
I think she was talking
about your abs, McFlabby.

26:38.940 --> 26:42.817
Okay, three calls about a month
ago. Called from his home phone.

26:42.841 --> 26:45.487
Called from his home phone.
Three calls in the last month.

26:45.511 --> 26:47.555
My sister can barely stand here.

26:47.579 --> 26:49.236
Is there any way we can
let her get some rest?

26:49.260 --> 26:49.988
Sure.

26:50.012 --> 26:51.386
We got an address.

26:53.672 --> 26:54.666
You keep an eye on them.

26:54.690 --> 26:58.337
The kidnappers call again, you tell them
no more money until we talk to the girl.

27:00.412 --> 27:03.146
Last time I did Halloween
I was an astronaut.

27:03.170 --> 27:04.435
Neighbourhood I grew up in-

27:04.459 --> 27:07.085
well, it really wasn't a neighbourhood.

27:07.109 --> 27:08.917
There were these estates with mansions

27:08.941 --> 27:12.674
smack-dab in the middle of
them and really long driveways.

27:12.832 --> 27:14.218
Made Halloween very tricky.

27:14.242 --> 27:15.814
It's a lot of walking.

27:15.861 --> 27:18.005
God, my feet were tired that night.

27:18.221 --> 27:19.647
Dogs were barking.

27:19.671 --> 27:22.056
Yeah, I gotta imagine it really
sucks growing up rich like that.

27:22.080 --> 27:24.684
My costume was fantastic, though.

27:24.852 --> 27:26.256
Wicked awesome.

27:26.321 --> 27:28.177
I was a spaceman.

27:28.201 --> 27:29.877
No ventilation, though.

27:29.901 --> 27:31.065
Burning up.

27:31.109 --> 27:34.507
Sweating like Roger Federer
after a five-set tiebreaker.

27:34.559 --> 27:35.956
And stinky.

27:35.989 --> 27:37.636
Stinky like cheese.

27:37.660 --> 27:41.557
Man, what a haul. I made off with
more candy than I could carry.

27:41.581 --> 27:44.507
Got to imagine this story's
coming to an end soon.

27:44.531 --> 27:46.087
But when I got home,

27:46.361 --> 27:48.724
old man made me throw it all away.

27:48.910 --> 27:50.188
Even the apples.

27:50.212 --> 27:52.276
He was concerned about your teeth.

27:53.781 --> 27:54.781
Oh...

27:55.401 --> 27:56.295
No, I...

27:56.319 --> 27:58.805
made my astronaut costume out of...

27:58.829 --> 28:02.695
one of his $3,000
designer ski suits.

28:03.841 --> 28:06.357
I don't think I sat down
again till Christmas.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.536
Good times, Probie.

28:09.199 --> 28:10.487
Good times.

28:22.359 --> 28:23.657
Kuruma.

28:23.882 --> 28:25.215
Plates match.

28:25.912 --> 28:27.705
It's Miller's stolen ride.

28:27.729 --> 28:29.187
This is his building.

28:29.211 --> 28:31.828
Second floor, apartment 207.

28:31.852 --> 28:34.355
Halloween doesn't
have to suck after all.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.624
Something was burned in here recently.

28:39.041 --> 28:40.675
It's still smoldering.

28:40.842 --> 28:42.556
Pop the trunk, McGee.

28:58.722 --> 29:00.986
Let's get this son of a bitch.

29:05.112 --> 29:06.906
What's going on?

29:19.330 --> 29:20.867
Federal agents!

29:21.802 --> 29:23.727
All right!

29:27.760 --> 29:30.026
Great group costume guys, but, uh...

29:30.050 --> 29:32.424
you spelled CSI wrong on your hats.

29:32.910 --> 29:34.328
Robert Miller?

29:34.352 --> 29:36.606
Somebody's in a bad mood.

29:37.512 --> 29:40.244
Right over there by
the blue alien ladies.

29:43.909 --> 29:46.385
It's not easy being a
root vegetable, is it?

29:48.661 --> 29:49.947
Robert Miller?

29:51.151 --> 29:54.335
Hab Sosli' guch!

29:54.359 --> 29:57.498
Boss, he just said, "Your
mother has a smooth forehead."

29:57.522 --> 29:59.916
It's a Klingon insult.

30:00.120 --> 30:01.105
You speak Klingon?

30:01.129 --> 30:03.187
Not fluently, but yes.

30:03.469 --> 30:04.756
Federal agents.

30:04.780 --> 30:06.976
Zeghbe Thlinganpu!

30:07.489 --> 30:10.347
Now he's saying,
"Klingons don't surrender."

30:12.472 --> 30:14.036
Are you Robert Miller?

30:14.791 --> 30:16.354
Who are you people?

30:17.252 --> 30:18.698
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

30:18.722 --> 30:20.525
Sarah Niles where is she?

30:20.959 --> 30:22.746
That bitch sent you here.

30:22.770 --> 30:25.436
My lawyer says I have a right
to know if she's my child.

30:25.460 --> 30:27.526
I'm just trying to do the right thing.

30:27.550 --> 30:30.176
If she's my daughter, I just
want to be a part of her life.

30:30.200 --> 30:32.395
She looks exactly like me.

30:33.450 --> 30:36.367
Well, except for the fake teeth
and the bumps on the forehead.

30:36.391 --> 30:37.977
Is that why you kidnapped her?

30:38.001 --> 30:39.235
I didn't kidnap anybody.

30:39.259 --> 30:42.206
The car that was used is
parked outside downstairs.

30:42.230 --> 30:44.717
I have no idea what the
hell you're talking about.

30:44.741 --> 30:47.086
I've been here all day with my
friends getting ready for this party.

30:47.110 --> 30:47.877
You can ask 'em.

30:47.901 --> 30:49.658
Boss, no sign of Sarah.

30:49.682 --> 30:50.868
See? I told you.

30:50.892 --> 30:53.335
The only thing I hate worse
than Halloween are Klingons.

30:53.359 --> 30:56.398
Look, ask 'em, okay? Ask the guy
with the cheesehead hat. Ask, uh,

30:56.422 --> 30:59.338
the vampire. David Lee
Roth. Carrot man, ask him.

30:59.362 --> 31:01.657
This has gone far enough.
I happen to be a lawyer.

31:01.681 --> 31:05.458
Good, the only thing I hate
worse than Klingons are lawyers.

31:05.482 --> 31:07.826
I didn't do anything, all right?

31:08.169 --> 31:10.026
Laurie's the one who threatened me.

31:10.050 --> 31:11.976
She told me that her husband...

31:12.582 --> 31:14.905
her husband was going to kill
me if I didn't leave her alone.

31:14.929 --> 31:16.188
Ask her.

31:16.212 --> 31:17.547
DiNozzo.

31:25.390 --> 31:25.936
Ziva.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.915
Boss wants to talk to the mom.

31:35.252 --> 31:36.435
Mrs. Niles?

31:36.459 --> 31:38.857
Agent Gibbs needs to talk to you.

32:13.540 --> 32:16.536
General Kang crying,
or is that just sweat?

32:18.218 --> 32:21.215
Half-hour alone in a
room with an angry Gibbs

32:21.239 --> 32:23.027
even Klingons have their limits.

32:23.051 --> 32:26.104
- What's he been doing to him?
- Mostly staring.

32:26.439 --> 32:28.366
Maybe that's a new
interrogation technique.

32:28.390 --> 32:31.334
Well, it seems to be working.
It's definitely creeping me out.

32:31.429 --> 32:32.305
You check his alibi?

32:32.329 --> 32:33.837
Well, according to six people,

32:33.861 --> 32:36.897
Worf here was at the party when
the little girl was kidnapped.

32:36.921 --> 32:38.994
Well, shouldn't we tell Gibbs that?

32:39.211 --> 32:41.075
Well, I don't know, Probie.

32:41.100 --> 32:44.535
Have you figured out how the kidnapper's
car was outside his apartment yet?

32:44.559 --> 32:46.217
He could have hired
someone to kidnap her.

32:46.241 --> 32:48.163
Or's being framed.

32:48.569 --> 32:50.816
I'm trying to cooperate, Agent Gibbs.

32:54.018 --> 32:55.804
Aren't you going to say anything?

33:02.428 --> 33:04.384
I screwed up, Ducky.

33:04.748 --> 33:06.894
I knew the staff sergeant's
wife was hiding something.

33:06.918 --> 33:09.204
That she wasn't telling
us the whole truth.

33:09.228 --> 33:10.674
And you know what I did?

33:10.779 --> 33:13.385
I allowed myself to feel sorry for her.

33:13.409 --> 33:16.047
Ugh! Do you know what that makes me?

33:16.071 --> 33:18.155
- Human.
- A chimp!

33:18.179 --> 33:20.005
I think she means "chump," Doctor.

33:20.029 --> 33:22.144
See, a chimp is an animal, Ziva,

33:22.168 --> 33:25.037
whereas a chump is someone
who's easy to take advantage of

33:25.061 --> 33:27.486
- or-or fooled...
- Mr. Palmer,

33:27.510 --> 33:28.385
I'm not saying that you are...

33:28.409 --> 33:31.086
would you mind giving us a moment alone?

33:34.568 --> 33:36.045
He means well.

33:36.110 --> 33:37.466
He's right.

33:37.828 --> 33:40.015
You're being too hard on yourself.

33:40.039 --> 33:41.964
I let Laurie Niles and her sister

33:41.988 --> 33:44.284
climb out of a bedroom
window in the middle

33:44.308 --> 33:45.926
of our investigation.

33:45.950 --> 33:48.534
Perhaps they should
throw me a parade, yes?

33:48.558 --> 33:51.296
The question we should
be asking ourselves...

33:51.320 --> 33:53.074
is why, Ziva.

33:53.098 --> 33:57.315
Two-thirds of all child abductions
are by a biological relative.

33:57.339 --> 33:59.144
She kidnapped her own child.

33:59.168 --> 34:02.185
You know what they say about
a mother bear and her cubs?

34:02.209 --> 34:03.967
They eat them when their food runs out.

34:03.991 --> 34:06.603
I saw it in a documentary, Tony...

34:06.668 --> 34:08.487
forced me to watch... Grizzly Man?

34:08.511 --> 34:11.617
I was referring to a mother
bear's protective nature

34:11.641 --> 34:13.376
when her cubs are threatened.

34:13.400 --> 34:15.667
There's no deadlier
creature on the planet.

34:15.690 --> 34:16.804
I agree.

34:16.829 --> 34:20.196
They also ate the man who shot
the footage and his girlfriend.

34:20.219 --> 34:22.096
Yeah, well, that's...
perfectly dreadful.

34:22.120 --> 34:23.096
That's what I said to Tony.

34:23.120 --> 34:25.166
My point is, Laurie Niles

34:25.190 --> 34:27.716
may have been trying
to protect her daughter.

34:27.739 --> 34:30.106
The husband filed for a separation.

34:30.130 --> 34:33.606
Another man was claiming
to be the child's father.

34:33.858 --> 34:37.255
She didn't want to lose
or share custody of Sarah.

34:37.279 --> 34:39.286
That's one possibility.

34:39.878 --> 34:41.346
What does Gibbs think?

34:42.768 --> 34:44.295
Hard to tell.

34:44.440 --> 34:46.795
He's currently not talking to me.

34:46.938 --> 34:48.817
Well, chin up, dear. It could be worse.

34:48.841 --> 34:49.841
Hmm.

34:50.121 --> 34:51.172
How?

34:51.578 --> 34:53.315
He could be a bear.

34:59.890 --> 35:02.195
You know, we're wasting time here.

35:03.189 --> 35:06.626
Right now there's someone's out there
with my daughter doing God knows what.

35:07.589 --> 35:09.096
Alleged.

35:10.049 --> 35:11.156
What?

35:11.599 --> 35:14.085
Alleged daughter, Miller.

35:14.891 --> 35:19.077
Whether I'm her father or not,
she's still Laurie's daughter.

35:19.101 --> 35:21.503
I still care about what happens to her.

35:23.489 --> 35:25.155
I believe you.

35:25.470 --> 35:27.896
Well, then why are we just sitting here?

35:27.959 --> 35:29.847
You're sitting; I'm waiting.

35:29.871 --> 35:31.354
Waiting for what?

35:38.798 --> 35:39.674
Talk to me, Abs.

35:39.698 --> 35:42.104
- Got an I.D. for you, Gibbs.
- On my way.

35:42.201 --> 35:43.835
- Checked Miller's alibi.
- He didn't do it.

35:43.859 --> 35:45.144
I know.

35:45.310 --> 35:46.295
Mind telling us how?

35:46.319 --> 35:48.014
Spent 40 minutes with him.

35:48.038 --> 35:49.284
Well, all you really
did was stare at him.

35:49.308 --> 35:51.067
You ever tried reading
a Klingon's face, McGee?

35:51.091 --> 35:52.946
It isn't exatly easy.

35:53.390 --> 35:55.207
I've I.D.'d our skeleton.

35:55.231 --> 35:57.416
Our dead John is no longer a Doe.

35:57.440 --> 36:00.203
I got a hit on him
from the DMV database.

36:00.428 --> 36:01.546
Lee Varon.

36:01.570 --> 36:04.004
He's 38 years old from
Fredericksburg, Virginia.

36:04.028 --> 36:06.567
- No criminal record.
- I want everything on this guy from birth

36:06.591 --> 36:09.785
until Ducky cracked his sternum.

36:09.931 --> 36:11.254
Yeah! On it, boss!

36:11.278 --> 36:12.464
- Right!
- Right.

36:16.139 --> 36:17.717
Not bad for a blonde.

36:17.741 --> 36:19.994
You know, there's no statistical
evidence that say blondes

36:20.018 --> 36:21.896
have lower IQ's than
any other hair color.

36:21.920 --> 36:23.194
I'll take your word for it, Abs.

36:23.218 --> 36:25.576
There's more-if
you're interested...

36:25.600 --> 36:27.053
Mr. President.

36:28.299 --> 36:31.847
I ran some tests on the piece of burned
paper found inside the kidnapper's car.

36:31.871 --> 36:34.514
There were no fingerprints, but
I did find traces of chemicals.

36:34.538 --> 36:35.357
Ink?

36:35.381 --> 36:36.066
Yes.

36:36.090 --> 36:39.385
When I applied my own special
and unique brand of chemical,

36:39.409 --> 36:41.447
ran it through the laser
scanner a few times,

36:41.471 --> 36:42.853
we get...

36:44.158 --> 36:45.324
this.

36:45.738 --> 36:49.424
The miracle that separates
us from all other primates.

36:53.630 --> 36:55.504
Really bad penmanship.

36:55.580 --> 36:56.975
Miller's home address.

36:56.999 --> 37:00.155
Probably given to the kidnapper
by the staff sergeant's wife.

37:00.179 --> 37:01.456
She didn't kidnap her daughter.

37:01.480 --> 37:03.094
Then where is Laurie Niles, Gibbs?

37:03.118 --> 37:04.834
Last time I saw her, with you.

37:04.858 --> 37:07.505
Okay, I admit I screwed that one up.

37:07.580 --> 37:09.663
But why did she run?

37:10.058 --> 37:11.656
She was hiding something.

37:11.680 --> 37:14.494
- So you do agree with me?
- Oh, yeah.

37:14.518 --> 37:16.426
You definitely screwed up.

37:17.220 --> 37:18.966
Is there something I should know?

37:19.239 --> 37:21.826
I think he's planning on devouring me.

37:23.078 --> 37:25.985
And they say blondes have all the fun.

37:27.458 --> 37:29.396
Our dead skeleton
served in the air force.

37:29.420 --> 37:32.275
Received an other than
honorable discharge in 2003.

37:32.299 --> 37:34.177
Did one year of community college.

37:34.201 --> 37:36.477
He was a security guard,
boss. Worked for a law firm,

37:36.501 --> 37:38.465
Kapp and Associates,
in Annandale, Virginia.

37:38.489 --> 37:43.067
Laurie Niles also works for Kapp and Associates,
Gibbs, she's their chief financial officer.

37:43.091 --> 37:43.874
So she knew him.

37:43.898 --> 37:44.466
Oh, yeah.

37:44.490 --> 37:45.827
She hired him to abduct her daughter.

37:45.851 --> 37:47.365
I mean, it's the only
thing that makes sense.

37:47.389 --> 37:48.727
There's another reason.

37:48.751 --> 37:51.606
They kidnapped her because they
want Laurie to do something.

37:51.630 --> 37:52.996
Like what?

37:53.940 --> 37:56.087
Ooh, got a hit on a BOLO here.

37:56.111 --> 37:57.926
Yeah, and, McGee?

37:58.091 --> 38:01.744
And this is strange because I
just entered it into the system.

38:02.708 --> 38:04.964
It's Varon's vehicle,
and it's been moving.

38:05.769 --> 38:07.527
There's a cop following it.

38:07.551 --> 38:09.617
No, the hits were
generated electronically.

38:09.641 --> 38:11.735
It's his E-Z Pass for
high-speed toll lanes.

38:11.759 --> 38:13.334
He's doing a lot of
driving for a dead guy.

38:13.358 --> 38:16.227
It left Woodridge right after Laurie
Niles and her sister disappeared.

38:16.251 --> 38:18.804
Made a little run up to Manassas
not too far from Miller's apartment.

38:18.828 --> 38:20.346
Last hit was five minutes ago.

38:20.370 --> 38:23.815
Annandale-one exit from
Kapp and Associates Law Firm.

38:26.888 --> 38:28.166
We're in.

38:31.838 --> 38:33.774
That's from Sarah's costume.

38:37.509 --> 38:38.736
Clear.

38:39.331 --> 38:42.116
Plates match our skeleton's
car in the parking lot.

38:45.451 --> 38:46.617
You two,

38:46.641 --> 38:47.893
find the girl.

39:03.118 --> 39:06.095
In the last office. Far room, far room.

39:06.119 --> 39:08.037
Visual contact on the sisters.

39:08.061 --> 39:09.577
Appears to be one male Caucasian,

39:09.601 --> 39:13.617
approximately 35 years old holding them
hostage with a semiautomatic weapon.

39:13.641 --> 39:16.086
You got a positive
I.D. on the little girl?

39:16.240 --> 39:19.166
That's a negative I can only see
the left side of the room, boss.

39:28.489 --> 39:29.954
I'm in.

39:30.898 --> 39:32.724
The insurance money's here.

39:32.748 --> 39:34.246
All $3 million.

39:34.270 --> 39:37.044
Now all you have to do is transfer to
these accounts and we call it a day.

39:37.068 --> 39:38.256
I want my daughter first.

39:38.280 --> 39:40.564
You'll get her once
you transfer the cash.

39:42.419 --> 39:44.774
You've been smart so far, Mrs. Niles.

39:44.928 --> 39:47.084
You played along to protect
your little princess.

39:47.108 --> 39:49.234
Hate to see you blow it now.

39:49.290 --> 39:51.197
You shot my husband.

39:51.221 --> 39:52.736
I didn't have a choice.

39:52.760 --> 39:54.667
We were supposed to kidnap
him and the girl, but...

39:54.691 --> 39:56.543
he chose to fight back.

39:57.349 --> 39:59.313
Don't make the same mistake.

40:00.301 --> 40:02.765
How-how do I know
you're not going to just

40:02.789 --> 40:04.744
kill us when I transfer this?

40:04.768 --> 40:05.936
I'll kill you if you don't.

40:05.960 --> 40:08.244
Look, we've come this far, Laurie.

40:08.268 --> 40:10.307
Just do it and let's end this.

40:10.331 --> 40:11.623
Please.

40:13.201 --> 40:15.357
NCIS is gonna figure this out.

40:15.381 --> 40:17.985
I've had those Navy cops
running around all night...

40:18.061 --> 40:19.126
they're clueless.

40:19.150 --> 40:20.814
Now, transfer the damn money.

40:20.838 --> 40:23.433
Federal agents! Drop your weapon!

40:33.080 --> 40:34.546
They-they still have Sarah.

40:34.570 --> 40:36.816
If she's in the
building, we'll find her.

40:45.641 --> 40:47.193
Clear in the hallway.

40:52.071 --> 40:53.225
Clear.

41:13.261 --> 41:14.515
Laurie.

41:14.560 --> 41:15.836
Hey.

41:16.088 --> 41:18.346
We're friends with your mommy.
We're here to take you home.

41:18.370 --> 41:20.855
We have the little girl.
Repeat, we have the little girl.

41:20.879 --> 41:23.144
GIBBS: Hey, hold up, hold up, hold up.

41:24.679 --> 41:26.006
We've got Sarah.

41:26.030 --> 41:29.423
Once we secure the building,
you and your sister can see her.

41:30.670 --> 41:33.515
She's not my sister!

41:33.539 --> 41:35.296
She's one of them!

41:35.320 --> 41:40.676
Told me if I didn't lie to
you, they'd kill my baby!

41:41.368 --> 41:42.185
Stop!

41:42.209 --> 41:44.525
All they wanted was the stupid money!

41:44.549 --> 41:45.796
Gun!

41:48.319 --> 41:49.797
Sarah!

41:49.821 --> 41:51.355
Mommy!

41:52.511 --> 41:54.463
Oh, baby!

41:55.909 --> 41:57.885
I love you so much!

41:59.351 --> 42:02.206
- I'm so glad you're okay.
- Oh, Mommy...

42:02.230 --> 42:04.716
Apparently, she doesn't have a sister.

42:05.741 --> 42:07.334
Halloween, Ziva.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.716
Be glad it only happens once a year.

42:10.429 --> 42:13.047
The sky is blue, the grass green,

42:13.071 --> 42:15.354
may we have our Halloween?

42:15.378 --> 42:18.087
That's how we used to say
"trick or treat" in Scotland.

42:18.111 --> 42:18.927
Thank you.

42:18.951 --> 42:21.926
You're most welcome, Your Highness.

42:22.121 --> 42:24.626
We have a lot of desks to get to.

42:26.390 --> 42:27.775
You didn't have to do this.

42:27.799 --> 42:30.526
Well, every kid deserves
a happy Halloween.

42:31.351 --> 42:34.415
Your husband is awake, and
asking for you and his daughter.

42:34.439 --> 42:36.825
There's a car waiting
for you when you're ready.

42:36.849 --> 42:41.363
Please let Agent Gibbs know how much
I appreciate him keeping his word.

42:41.731 --> 42:44.593
And that I'm sorry I
lied to him, but I was...

42:44.671 --> 42:47.406
- I was just trying to protect...
- Trust me.

42:47.771 --> 42:49.033
He knows.

42:55.679 --> 42:57.333
Look at this.

42:59.149 --> 43:01.425
Trick or treat!

43:01.449 --> 43:03.873
Daddy, look I got more candy!
