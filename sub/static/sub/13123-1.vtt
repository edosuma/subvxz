01:12.862 --> 01:14.625
I'm gone to the market, Idella.

01:18.868 --> 01:22.133
<i>Pepsodent's new improved formula
cleans teeth whiter than ever.</i>

02:31.307 --> 02:33.468
Are you all right, Miss Daisy?

02:54.564 --> 02:55.895
That's good!

03:22.525 --> 03:24.356
You two get back to work.

04:04.567 --> 04:06.558
- Mama!
- No!

04:07.069 --> 04:11.563
It's a miracle you're not laying at
Emory Hospital or the funeral parlor.

04:13.743 --> 04:15.802
Cucumbers are pretty this summer.

04:16.077 --> 04:18.410
You didn't even break your glasses.

04:18.648 --> 04:20.478
It was the car's fault!

04:20.750 --> 04:23.913
- You had the car in the wrong gear.
- I did not!

04:24.320 --> 04:26.151
Idella, want a pickle with lunch?

04:26.422 --> 04:27.582
Not me.

04:27.924 --> 04:30.916
I'm putting up a jar for
you to take home to William.

04:32.762 --> 04:35.322
You backed the car into
the Pollack's yard.

04:35.598 --> 04:39.762
You should have let me keep my Lasalle.
It wouldn't have behaved this way.

04:40.102 --> 04:43.435
Mama, cars don't behave.
They are behaved upon.

04:43.773 --> 04:46.105
You demolished that
Chrysler by yourself.

04:46.342 --> 04:48.333
Think what you want.
I know the truth.

04:48.778 --> 04:52.111
The truth is you just cost
the insurance company $2,700.

04:52.448 --> 04:54.109
You are a terrible risk.

04:54.350 --> 04:56.341
Nobody will issue you a policy now.

04:56.519 --> 04:58.851
You're just saying that to be hateful.

04:59.455 --> 05:02.947
Okay. Yes, I am!
I am making it all up.

05:03.526 --> 05:05.118
Look out on the driveway!

05:05.795 --> 05:08.457
Every insurance company in
America is out there...

05:08.698 --> 05:11.189
...waving their pens
to get you to sign up.

05:11.467 --> 05:16.131
If you're going to stand in my pantry
and lie like a rug, go somewhere else.

05:18.975 --> 05:20.966
I better get back to the office.

05:21.877 --> 05:25.210
Florine will have a fit if I don't
get home on time tonight.

05:25.481 --> 05:27.312
You all must have plans tonight.

05:27.550 --> 05:29.211
The Ansleys' dinner party.

05:29.485 --> 05:31.817
This is her idea of heaven on earth.

05:32.154 --> 05:33.154
What?

05:33.322 --> 05:35.813
Socializing with Episcopalians.

05:40.229 --> 05:41.890
You are a doodle, Mama!

05:42.398 --> 05:44.059
I'll stop by tomorrow evening.

05:44.333 --> 05:46.733
How do you know I'll be here?

05:47.003 --> 05:48.834
I'm not dependent on you for company.

05:49.171 --> 05:51.162
Fine, I'll call first.

05:51.574 --> 05:54.907
But you know, we have got some
real serious talking to do.

05:55.177 --> 05:56.177
No!

06:34.383 --> 06:38.217
I need you now. I have to be at
the beauty shop in half an hour.

06:40.122 --> 06:44.957
No, I most certainly did not know you
had to call a minimum of 2 hours ahead.

06:45.294 --> 06:49.788
Why call yourself a taxicab company
if you can't provide taxicabs?

06:50.399 --> 06:53.960
Why don't you call your son?
He'd send someone to carry you.

06:54.236 --> 06:55.897
That won't be necessary.

06:56.238 --> 06:59.230
I'll cancel the appointment
and fix my own hair.

06:59.575 --> 07:03.909
Sometimes I think you ain't
got the sense God gave a lemon.

07:06.315 --> 07:08.647
Two dots. I want that!

07:10.486 --> 07:11.976
And a five bamboo.

07:12.254 --> 07:15.246
Well, this is not my day for mah-jongg.

07:15.491 --> 07:16.491
Nine bam!

07:16.659 --> 07:21.323
Thank you all for coming here again.
I am a real pariah without my car.

07:21.597 --> 07:23.087
Oh, nonsense!

07:23.666 --> 07:25.156
When do you get the new one?

07:25.334 --> 07:28.497
I don't know! Boolie's
being real pokey about it.

07:28.771 --> 07:31.171
I'll come after you for temple tomorrow.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.431
That's sweet of you, honey.

07:37.179 --> 07:38.510
Mama, you there?

07:39.281 --> 07:40.612
It's just us!

07:40.783 --> 07:42.273
Why didn't you call?

07:42.518 --> 07:43.610
We can't stay.

07:43.853 --> 07:45.184
So I gather.

07:45.454 --> 07:47.285
The Millers are giving a hay ride.

07:47.456 --> 07:50.789
I had these made.
Doesn't your baby look cute?

07:51.026 --> 07:53.859
Well, it's not exactly
the word I'd pick.

07:55.464 --> 07:58.297
New Graham Greene?
I been wanting to read that.

07:58.634 --> 08:01.797
Sorry, but it's due back
at the library tomorrow.

08:02.037 --> 08:04.198
- Want me to return it for you?
- No, thank you.

08:04.473 --> 08:07.135
I'll go to the library on the streetcar.

08:07.877 --> 08:12.371
Damn it, Mama! Quit being so stubborn.
You know perfectly well...

08:12.815 --> 08:15.716
Go on! Don't keep the horses waiting.

08:16.485 --> 08:17.645
Bye!

08:31.167 --> 08:33.158
Is that door making contact?

08:39.241 --> 08:40.241
Oscar?

08:40.409 --> 08:41.409
I'm here.

08:41.577 --> 08:44.239
- Are you all right?
- No, sir, I'm stuck.

08:44.513 --> 08:46.674
I know. Fiddle with the lever.

08:46.849 --> 08:49.409
It fiddled out. I done all I know how.

08:51.420 --> 08:53.183
Call Bell Elevator.

08:53.422 --> 08:56.755
I already did. They're
backed up until around 1:00.

08:57.092 --> 08:58.753
Did you tell them it's an emergency!

08:59.028 --> 09:01.428
You don't have to holler, Mr. Werthan.

09:01.697 --> 09:03.927
I did not break the elevator.

09:04.700 --> 09:06.691
Got that stuff for Davis & Paxon?

09:06.936 --> 09:08.597
Wrapped and ready to go!

09:08.771 --> 09:11.433
I promised it for today.
Call Bell again.

09:17.780 --> 09:19.111
I hear you.

09:19.882 --> 09:24.376
Look up where the gate is supposed
to close. See a do-hickey?

09:24.553 --> 09:25.884
Wait a minute.

09:27.289 --> 09:28.289
Right here!

09:28.457 --> 09:31.722
Reach up and mash it
up until it catches.

09:33.796 --> 09:35.627
I done it. Now what?

09:36.065 --> 09:37.555
Operate the lever.

09:49.812 --> 09:51.143
Do you work here?

09:51.313 --> 09:52.974
No, sir. This here Hoke.

09:53.249 --> 09:54.580
Hoke Colburn, sir.

09:54.917 --> 09:56.248
How'd you know about the elevator?

09:56.418 --> 09:58.750
I used to drive for a dairy, sir.

09:59.154 --> 10:01.816
Their elevator was
worse than this one.

10:02.024 --> 10:04.151
Hoke the one I told you about.

10:04.426 --> 10:05.484
Of course.

10:17.606 --> 10:18.937
Excuse me, sir.

10:19.275 --> 10:21.266
Y'all people's Jewish, ain't you?

10:21.443 --> 10:22.842
Yeah, we are. Why?

10:23.112 --> 10:25.273
I'd rather work for Jews.

10:25.614 --> 10:28.344
I know folks say they stingy and cheap.

10:28.617 --> 10:30.847
But don't say none of that around me!

10:31.120 --> 10:32.781
Good to know you feel that way.

10:55.144 --> 10:56.577
What was your last job?

10:56.745 --> 11:00.977
I worked for Judge Harold
Stone, a Jewish gentleman.

11:01.250 --> 11:02.649
You worked for Judge Stone?

11:02.918 --> 11:06.911
Seven years. I'd still be
there if he didn't up and die.

11:07.256 --> 11:10.089
Mrs. Stone asked me to move
to Savannah with her.

11:10.326 --> 11:12.760
Of course, my wife was dead by then.

11:12.995 --> 11:15.156
But I said, "No, thank you, ma'am."

11:15.431 --> 11:18.093
I didn't want to be too
far from my grandbabies.

11:18.267 --> 11:19.928
Judge Stone was my father's friend.

11:20.169 --> 11:21.500
You don't say?

11:21.770 --> 11:22.770
Sit.

11:23.505 --> 11:25.496
Later, Miss McClatchey.

11:28.677 --> 11:31.840
Oscar said you needed somebody
to drive for your family.

11:32.114 --> 11:34.674
Will I be taking your
children to school...

11:34.950 --> 11:36.941
...and your wife to the beauty parlor?

11:37.286 --> 11:39.948
I don't have any children.
What I need...

11:40.622 --> 11:43.614
You're still a young man.
Don't worry too much.

11:44.460 --> 11:46.121
Thank you. I won't.

11:46.628 --> 11:49.620
Hoke, I need somebody
to drive my mother around.

11:50.966 --> 11:54.800
Yes. Well, if you don't
mind my asking, sir...

11:55.137 --> 11:57.628
...why ain't she hiring for herself?

12:00.142 --> 12:02.133
It's a difficult situation.

12:02.978 --> 12:05.469
She done gone around the bend a little.

12:05.714 --> 12:07.875
That will happen as they get on.

12:08.150 --> 12:09.640
No, she's all there!

12:10.152 --> 12:11.983
Too much there is the problem!

12:15.057 --> 12:17.218
I want you to understand something.

12:17.659 --> 12:20.560
My mother is a little high strung.

12:22.164 --> 12:25.156
The fact is, you would
be working for me.

12:25.401 --> 12:27.733
She can say anything she likes...

12:28.003 --> 12:30.995
...but she can't fire you. Understand?

12:32.007 --> 12:33.338
Yes, sir.

12:34.843 --> 12:36.504
Yes, sir, I sure do.

12:36.745 --> 12:38.508
Don't worry, Mr. Werthan.

12:38.914 --> 12:41.576
I'll hold on no matter
which way she run me.

12:41.850 --> 12:46.014
I was a little boy back on the farm
above Macon where I come from.

12:46.355 --> 12:49.188
I wrestled hogs to the
ground during killing time.

12:49.525 --> 12:53.017
Well, sir, there ain't a
hog got away from me yet!

13:41.143 --> 13:42.804
How are you, Idella?

13:43.078 --> 13:44.238
Living.

13:44.580 --> 13:47.743
- Where's the new vacuum cleaner?
- In the closet.

13:47.983 --> 13:49.143
She won't touch it.

13:49.418 --> 13:52.080
It gives me a shock
every time I'm near it.

13:52.254 --> 13:53.585
It works for me.

13:53.755 --> 13:57.748
Good! Then you clean and I'll
go down and run your office.

13:58.494 --> 13:59.825
Where's Mama?

14:00.095 --> 14:01.426
Up yonder.

14:01.763 --> 14:03.594
I guess you know who this is.

14:05.834 --> 14:07.426
I'll be right back.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.831
I wouldn't be in your shoes...

14:13.909 --> 14:18.005
...if the sweet Lord Jesus came
down and asked me Himself.

14:27.623 --> 14:28.783
Good morning, Mama.

14:38.967 --> 14:41.197
Just come down and say hello.

14:41.470 --> 14:42.960
You listen here.

14:43.205 --> 14:47.039
Unless they rewrote the Constitution
and didn't tell me, I still have rights!

14:47.309 --> 14:48.309
Of course.

14:48.544 --> 14:53.140
What I do not want, and absolutely
will not have, is...

14:53.482 --> 14:57.714
...some chauffeur sitting in my kitchen,
gobbling my food, using my phone.

14:57.986 --> 14:59.647
I hate that in my house.

14:59.888 --> 15:00.980
You have Idella.

15:01.156 --> 15:04.216
Idella's different!
She's been coming to me for years.

15:04.493 --> 15:06.723
We stay out of each other's way.

15:06.995 --> 15:10.328
Even so, there are chips
in my wedding china.

15:10.566 --> 15:13.899
You think Idella has a vendetta
against your wedding china?

15:14.169 --> 15:15.500
Don't be sassy.

15:15.904 --> 15:18.896
When we couldn't afford them,
we did for ourselves.

15:19.074 --> 15:20.735
That's still the best way.

15:21.009 --> 15:25.173
"Them?" "Afford them?"
You sound like Governor Talmadge.

15:25.414 --> 15:28.406
What a thing to say!
I'm not prejudiced!

15:28.750 --> 15:30.411
Aren't you ashamed?!

15:31.520 --> 15:33.750
You might as well make the best of it.

16:35.484 --> 16:38.976
I knew a Miss Idella once.
Back down in Macon.

16:39.254 --> 16:40.744
You don't say?

16:41.423 --> 16:42.423
She sang!

16:42.758 --> 16:44.919
What are you talking about?

16:45.160 --> 16:47.492
I'm talking about this
woman had some lungs!

16:47.763 --> 16:50.755
She'd be a whole church
choir by herself!

16:50.999 --> 16:52.159
I declare!

16:52.501 --> 16:53.763
Fat, too!

16:53.935 --> 16:55.766
She was as big as that stove!

16:58.707 --> 17:01.870
Don't talk to Idella!
She has work to do.

17:14.790 --> 17:16.451
What are you doing?

17:16.791 --> 17:19.124
Dusting the bulbs, Miss Daisy.

17:19.294 --> 17:21.785
That's the silliest thing I ever saw.

17:22.030 --> 17:24.191
Who cares if lamp bulbs are dusty?

17:24.366 --> 17:25.856
Get down from there!

17:26.867 --> 17:29.530
Put that ladder away
before somebody trips.

17:34.509 --> 17:35.976
I'm gone, Miss Daisy.

17:36.211 --> 17:38.543
All right, Idella. See you tomorrow.

17:39.314 --> 17:42.477
- I'm going too, Miss Daisy.
- Good.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.663
Good morning, Miss Daisy.
Thought I'd see after your zinnias.

18:02.904 --> 18:05.168
Leave me flower bed alone.

18:06.508 --> 18:11.172
You got a nice piece of ground behind
the garage that ain't doing nothing.

18:11.413 --> 18:12.937
I could put in tomatoes...

18:13.749 --> 18:17.412
If I want a vegetable garden,
I'll plant it myself.

18:51.119 --> 18:52.279
What are you doing?

18:53.889 --> 18:57.381
I just love a house with
pictures, Miss Daisy.

18:57.626 --> 18:59.116
It do make a home.

18:59.394 --> 19:02.557
I don't want you nosing
through my things.

19:14.075 --> 19:15.736
Good morning, Miss Daisy.

19:17.145 --> 19:19.477
It was right cold in the night.

19:19.748 --> 19:22.080
I wouldn't know. I was asleep.

19:26.154 --> 19:28.714
Idella says we're
running short on coffee...

19:28.824 --> 19:30.257
...and Dutch cleanser.

19:30.926 --> 19:31.926
We are?

19:32.160 --> 19:33.160
Yes, ma'am.

19:33.328 --> 19:35.660
We're low on silver polish, too.

19:36.832 --> 19:38.322
I know.

19:39.601 --> 19:42.593
I'm fixing to go to the
Piggly Wiggly on the trolley.

19:42.938 --> 19:46.601
On the trolley!
Why don't you let me carry you?

19:46.842 --> 19:48.002
No, thank you.

19:48.210 --> 19:50.371
Ain't that why Mr. Werthan hired me?

19:50.545 --> 19:52.206
That's his problem.

19:52.781 --> 19:56.615
All right. But I'm going to
find something to do here.

19:56.785 --> 19:58.616
You leave my things alone!

19:59.788 --> 20:02.120
I'm gone to the market, Idella.

20:03.792 --> 20:05.453
Miss Daisy, it's a shame.

20:05.794 --> 20:09.457
You have this fine Hudson
automobile out there in the garage.

20:09.698 --> 20:13.691
It hasn't moved an inch from
when Mr. Werthan drove it here.

20:14.135 --> 20:17.696
That insurance company gave you
a brand new car for nothing.

20:17.973 --> 20:19.235
That's your opinion.

20:20.642 --> 20:24.976
My other opinion is that a fine rich,
Jewish lady like yourself...

20:25.213 --> 20:30.048
...has no business dragging herself
onto a trolley carrying grocery bags.

20:30.552 --> 20:32.213
I'll carry them for you.

20:32.487 --> 20:33.818
I don't need you!

20:34.155 --> 20:37.249
I don't want you!
And don't say I'm rich!

20:37.525 --> 20:40.358
- I won't say it no more.
- Is that what you and Idella talk about?

20:41.496 --> 20:44.556
I hate being discussed behind
my back in my own house!

20:45.901 --> 20:48.062
I was born on Forsyth Street.

20:48.336 --> 20:50.497
Believe me. I know
the value of a penny!

20:50.839 --> 20:53.171
My brother brought
home a white cat once.

20:53.408 --> 20:56.502
We couldn't keep it because
we couldn't afford to feed it!

20:56.912 --> 20:58.504
My sister saved up money...

20:58.580 --> 21:01.913
...so I could become a teacher!
We had nothing!

21:03.018 --> 21:05.350
But you're doing all right now!

21:28.576 --> 21:30.066
What are you doing?!

21:30.345 --> 21:32.836
I'm trying to drive you to the store!

21:39.020 --> 21:42.251
Where are you off to this
morning, Miss Werthan?

21:42.524 --> 21:44.185
Just a little shopping.

21:45.360 --> 21:48.693
Go away! I've ridden the trolley
with the groceries plenty of times!

21:48.930 --> 21:53.765
But I can't keep taking
Mr. Werthan's money for doing nothing.

21:54.102 --> 21:55.763
How much he pay you?

21:56.204 --> 21:58.866
Miss Daisy, that's between him and me.

21:59.107 --> 22:03.441
Anything over $7 a week
is highway robbery!

22:03.712 --> 22:05.771
You sure are right about that!

22:06.047 --> 22:07.981
Especially since I don't do nothing...

22:08.049 --> 22:10.176
...but sit on a stool all day.

22:12.287 --> 22:13.447
All right!

22:14.723 --> 22:16.054
Piggly Wiggly.

22:16.624 --> 22:19.286
Then home. Nowhere else.

22:34.743 --> 22:37.906
Oh, I just love the smell of a new car.

22:38.146 --> 22:39.977
Don't you, Miss Daisy?

22:43.651 --> 22:45.642
I am nobody's fool, Hoke.

22:45.920 --> 22:47.251
I know!

22:47.489 --> 22:49.923
My husband taught me to run a car.

22:50.759 --> 22:53.091
I remember everything he said.

22:53.328 --> 22:55.990
So don't think even for a second you...

22:56.264 --> 22:58.164
Wait. You're speeding.

22:58.333 --> 22:59.664
I can see it!

23:00.001 --> 23:02.492
We only going 19 miles an hour.

23:02.771 --> 23:05.103
I like to go under the speed limit.

23:05.607 --> 23:07.598
But the speed limit is 35 here.

23:07.842 --> 23:10.504
The slower you go the more gas you save.

23:10.779 --> 23:12.940
My husband taught me that!

23:14.949 --> 23:17.679
Ain't hardly moving.
Might as well walk...

23:18.019 --> 23:19.509
...to Piggly Wiggly.

23:20.121 --> 23:21.748
Is this your car?

23:23.625 --> 23:24.284
No.

23:24.526 --> 23:26.118
Do you pay for the gas?

23:28.196 --> 23:30.130
- No.
- All right, then!

23:30.465 --> 23:32.797
My son thinks I'm losing my abilities...

23:33.034 --> 23:36.367
...but I am still in control
of what goes on in my car!

23:39.974 --> 23:41.464
Where are you going?

23:42.477 --> 23:44.468
To the store, like you said.

23:44.712 --> 23:46.703
Why didn't you turn on Highland?

23:46.981 --> 23:48.972
Piggly Wiggly ain't on Highland.

23:49.150 --> 23:52.483
I know where it is!
Now take Highland Avenue.

23:52.654 --> 23:55.555
- That's 3 blocks out of the way.
- Go back this minute!

23:55.824 --> 23:58.622
- I can't turn now.
- I've been driving to Piggly Wiggly...

23:58.827 --> 24:02.490
...since it opened for business.
This isn't the way!

24:02.897 --> 24:04.387
Go back this minute!

24:04.566 --> 24:08.058
Miss Daisy, look. Yonder
is the Piggly Wiggly. See?

24:10.738 --> 24:12.399
Get ready to turn.

24:19.914 --> 24:21.745
Look out. There's a little girl
behind that car.

24:22.016 --> 24:23.643
Yes, I see her.

24:23.918 --> 24:25.408
Pull in right here.

24:34.262 --> 24:35.422
Wait.

24:35.930 --> 24:37.363
Give me the keys.

24:43.438 --> 24:45.599
Stay right here by the car.

24:45.940 --> 24:48.602
And don't tell everyone my business.

25:13.234 --> 25:14.565
Mr. Werthan?

25:16.404 --> 25:19.567
Yes, sir, it's me! Guess where I'm at.

25:20.408 --> 25:22.899
I just drove your mama to the store!

25:23.578 --> 25:28.413
You know, she flapped around some,
but she's all right. She's in the store.

25:30.151 --> 25:33.746
Oh, Lord, she just looked
out the window and seen me.

25:33.988 --> 25:37.480
She'll probably throw a fit right
there at the check-out counter.

25:38.493 --> 25:42.827
Yes, sir. You are right about that.
It only took me 6 days.

25:43.097 --> 25:46.089
Same time it took the
Lord to make the world.

25:46.601 --> 25:48.933
Yes, sir. All right. 'Bye.

26:00.114 --> 26:03.447
Hey Oscar, Junior. How you
old boys doing today?

26:03.751 --> 26:05.616
How the lady been treating you?

26:05.954 --> 26:09.617
I'll tell you one thing;
She knows how to throw a fit.

26:10.959 --> 26:12.119
What's so funny?

26:14.362 --> 26:17.297
Nothing, Miss Daisy.
We just carrying on.

26:17.532 --> 26:21.696
Oscar and Junior been doing cleaning
here for 15 years. Never carried on before!

26:22.704 --> 26:24.035
Leave them alone.

26:24.973 --> 26:26.463
Put your coat on.
We're late.

26:28.309 --> 26:30.641
Idella, I'm gone now.

26:31.646 --> 26:33.637
I'm right behind her.

26:41.155 --> 26:45.819
Hear, oh Israel, the Lord
our God, the Lord is one.

27:30.705 --> 27:34.698
Such a nice man. And such a good,
short sermon, wasn't it?

27:43.117 --> 27:44.778
I can get it myself!

27:45.053 --> 27:46.543
Hurry out of here!

28:03.471 --> 28:05.735
Is something wrong, Miss Daisy?

28:07.241 --> 28:08.731
Something I done?

28:11.813 --> 28:12.973
Yes.

28:13.748 --> 28:15.238
I haven't done anything.

28:15.483 --> 28:20.318
You parked the car right in front of the
temple, like I was the Queen of Romania.

28:20.588 --> 28:22.249
Everybody saw you!

28:22.657 --> 28:24.488
I said to wait for me in back.

28:24.759 --> 28:27.751
Yes, Ma'am, but I was just trying to...

28:28.096 --> 28:30.587
There were two chauffeurs
right behind me.

28:30.932 --> 28:33.992
You made me look like a fool.
A g.d. fool!

28:34.268 --> 28:38.432
Oh, Miss Daisy, Lord
knows you ain't no fool!

28:38.840 --> 28:40.171
Slow down!

28:42.110 --> 28:46.444
Miriam and Beulah, I could see what
they were thinking when we came out.

28:46.681 --> 28:48.012
What's that?

28:48.783 --> 28:50.944
That I was pretending to be rich!

28:51.185 --> 28:53.517
- You is rich.
- No, I'm not!

28:53.788 --> 28:55.949
Nobody can say I put on airs.

28:56.190 --> 28:59.785
On Forsyth Street we made many
meals of grits and gravy.

29:00.027 --> 29:02.188
I have done without plenty of times.

29:02.463 --> 29:06.456
Miss Daisy, if I was to ever
get my hands on what you got...

29:06.968 --> 29:10.961
...shoot, I'd shake it around
for everyone in the world to see.

29:11.205 --> 29:13.867
That's vulgar! Don't talk to me!

29:16.043 --> 29:18.705
Never understand some white folks.

29:19.046 --> 29:20.877
What was that?! I heard that!

29:21.215 --> 29:24.707
Now, Miss Daisy...
you needs a chauffeur...

29:25.386 --> 29:27.217
...and Lord knows I need a job.

29:27.488 --> 29:30.480
So why don't we just leave it at that?

30:26.280 --> 30:28.771
Good morning, Mama.
What's the matter?

30:30.551 --> 30:33.884
No, I don't always think
something's wrong when you call.

30:34.121 --> 30:36.453
Just when you call so early.

30:37.892 --> 30:39.018
What?!

30:40.728 --> 30:44.721
All right. I'll be there
as soon as I can.

30:49.070 --> 30:51.231
I better get on over there.

30:51.572 --> 30:52.732
'Bye.

30:53.574 --> 30:54.574
Come on.

30:54.642 --> 30:57.736
It's not healthy to rush like this.

30:58.079 --> 31:00.240
I eat too much, anyway.

31:00.815 --> 31:03.750
Besides, it sounds like she needs me.

31:03.985 --> 31:07.250
When doesn't it?
Give Mother Werthan my love.

31:13.494 --> 31:15.155
Coffee, Katie Bell!

31:27.241 --> 31:29.402
I didn't expect to
find you in one piece.

31:29.644 --> 31:32.272
I wanted you to be here
when he comes.

31:32.380 --> 31:33.904
I wanted you to hear it
for yourself.

31:34.081 --> 31:35.742
What is going on?

31:35.983 --> 31:38.144
He's stealing from me.

31:38.819 --> 31:40.650
Hoke? Are you sure?

31:40.922 --> 31:43.914
I don't make empty accusations.
I have proof!

31:44.825 --> 31:49.319
This! I found it hidden in the
garbage under some coffee grounds.

31:49.931 --> 31:53.332
- He stole a can of salmon?
- Here it is!

31:53.601 --> 31:56.092
I knew there was something funny.

31:56.337 --> 31:59.932
They all take things, you know.
So I counted.

32:00.841 --> 32:02.502
The silverware first.

32:02.777 --> 32:06.178
Then the linen napkins.
And then I went into the pantry.

32:07.448 --> 32:11.612
And the first thing that
caught my eye was a hole...

32:11.852 --> 32:13.513
...behind the lima beans.

32:13.854 --> 32:15.947
And I knew right away.

32:17.792 --> 32:20.693
There are only 8 cans of salmon.
I had 9!

32:20.861 --> 32:22.351
3 for $1 on sale.

32:22.630 --> 32:24.291
Very clever, Mama.

32:24.632 --> 32:27.294
I missed my breakfast and
I'm late to a meeting...

32:27.535 --> 32:29.799
...for a 33c can of salmon?

32:30.137 --> 32:32.128
You want 33c? Here's $1!

32:32.306 --> 32:35.298
Here's $10! Buy yourself
a pantry full of salmon!

32:35.476 --> 32:37.137
Why, Boolie, the idea!

32:37.311 --> 32:39.472
Waving money at me like that!

32:39.714 --> 32:42.148
I don't want money.
I want my things!

32:42.483 --> 32:45.816
- One can of salmon?
- Well, it was mine!

32:46.654 --> 32:49.316
I leave him plenty of food every day.

32:49.657 --> 32:52.148
I tell him exactly what it is.

32:52.393 --> 32:55.988
Like children. If they want
something, they just take it!

32:56.330 --> 32:57.888
He'll never admit this.

32:58.065 --> 33:01.228
"No," he'll say, "I don't
know nothing about that!"

33:01.502 --> 33:05.336
I don't like it! I don't
like living with no privacy.

33:07.575 --> 33:11.011
Go ahead, defend him.
You always do!

33:11.412 --> 33:15.746
I give up! You want to drive again,
arrange your own insurance.

33:16.017 --> 33:17.177
Take the trolley.

33:17.518 --> 33:20.351
Buy yourself a taxicab!
Anything you want!

33:20.688 --> 33:22.849
Just leave me out of it!

33:23.090 --> 33:24.751
Why, Boolie!

33:29.864 --> 33:33.356
What's he doing here
this time of morning?

33:33.701 --> 33:36.363
Can't be good, I promise you that!

33:50.117 --> 33:53.052
I think it's fixing to
clear up out there!

33:53.888 --> 33:56.550
Excuse me, Mr. Werthan.
Y'all busy?

33:57.224 --> 33:59.784
We have to have a little talk, Hoke.

34:01.896 --> 34:05.059
All right, just let me
get out of my coat.

34:12.806 --> 34:16.299
Yesterday, while you were out,
I ate a can of your salmon.

34:16.577 --> 34:20.911
Now I know you said to eat
the leftover pork chops.

34:21.649 --> 34:23.480
Well, they were kind of stiff.

34:23.818 --> 34:27.310
So, I stopped by the Piggly
Wiggly and got you another can.

34:27.588 --> 34:29.647
Do you want me to put it on the shelf?

34:31.425 --> 34:33.585
Yes, thank you, Hoke.

34:34.094 --> 34:35.755
Be right with you, Mr. Werthan.

34:38.264 --> 34:41.428
Well, I got to get dressed now.

34:42.268 --> 34:43.929
Good-bye, son.

36:23.771 --> 36:27.434
You know, Miss Daisy,
I was just thinking.

36:28.275 --> 36:31.608
We been out to this cemetery
3 times this month already.

36:31.779 --> 36:33.371
It ain't even the 20th yet.

36:33.614 --> 36:35.275
It's good to come in nice weather.

36:35.549 --> 36:39.041
Yes, ma'am. You sure
right about that. Sure is.

36:41.288 --> 36:44.621
Mr. Sig's grave is mighty well tended.

36:45.059 --> 36:48.551
I think you're the best widow
in the State of Georgia.

36:48.896 --> 36:52.889
Boolie's always pestering me to have
the staff here tend to this plot.

36:53.234 --> 36:55.566
"Perpetual care," they call it.

36:55.970 --> 36:57.961
Well, don't you do it!

36:58.305 --> 37:01.968
It's right to have member of
the family looking after you.

37:02.243 --> 37:06.907
I'll never have that! Boolie will have
me in perpetual care before I'm cold.

37:08.415 --> 37:11.907
Miss Daisy, you ought to
go on away from here!

37:14.255 --> 37:17.088
Put that azalea on Leo Bauer's grave.

37:17.758 --> 37:21.751
Leo Bauer. Is that Miss
Rose Bauer's husband?

37:22.263 --> 37:24.754
She asked me to bring it out here.

37:26.934 --> 37:29.095
Where is his grave at, Miss Daisy?

37:29.670 --> 37:34.334
I'm not exactly sure. I know
it's two rows over that way.

37:35.175 --> 37:37.507
You'll see the headstone, "Bauer."

37:41.348 --> 37:42.610
What's wrong?

37:42.783 --> 37:45.946
Nothing wrong.
Nothing the matter at all.

37:53.460 --> 37:54.791
Now, you say...

37:54.962 --> 37:59.296
I told you it's two rows over that way.
It says "Bauer" on the headstone.

38:01.502 --> 38:03.163
What that look like?

38:03.637 --> 38:05.036
What are you talking about?

38:06.140 --> 38:09.371
I'm talking about I can't read, ma'am.

38:10.644 --> 38:11.644
What?!

38:11.745 --> 38:13.610
I can't read, Miss Daisy.

38:13.981 --> 38:16.211
You look at the paper all the time.

38:16.483 --> 38:20.146
Well, that's just it. I just be looking!

38:20.487 --> 38:22.819
I try to dope out what's going on...

38:23.057 --> 38:24.388
...from the pictures.

38:24.658 --> 38:26.148
You know your letters?

38:26.393 --> 38:29.988
Yes, ma'am. I know my ABC's.
I just can't read.

38:30.431 --> 38:32.524
Stop saying that!
You're making me mad!

38:33.500 --> 38:35.991
If you know letters, then you can read.

38:36.403 --> 38:38.234
You just don't know you can read.

38:39.173 --> 38:42.836
I taught some of the stupidest
children God ever put on this earth.

38:43.077 --> 38:46.240
And they all could read enough
to find a name on a tombstone.

38:47.081 --> 38:49.174
The name is "Bauer."

38:53.420 --> 38:56.583
"Bauer!" What does that "buh"
letter sound like?

38:58.525 --> 39:00.686
- B?
- Of course!

39:03.864 --> 39:06.355
"Er." That is the last part. "Bauer!"

39:06.600 --> 39:08.261
What letter sounds like "er"?

39:10.704 --> 39:11.704
R!

39:11.872 --> 39:14.067
- So the first letter is...
- B!

39:14.241 --> 39:15.572
And the last letter?

39:15.809 --> 39:16.809
R!

39:17.211 --> 39:19.042
B-R. Brr.

39:19.279 --> 39:21.941
It even sounds like Bauer, doesn't it?

39:22.383 --> 39:26.444
It sure do, Miss Daisy! It sure do!

39:30.290 --> 39:32.281
- That it?
- That's it.

39:33.560 --> 39:37.052
- What about the middle?
- Not right now.

39:37.297 --> 39:40.232
This will be enough for you to find it.

40:03.424 --> 40:05.255
B at the beginning.

40:06.260 --> 40:07.921
R at the end.

40:15.102 --> 40:17.263
B... R.

40:18.439 --> 40:19.770
That's it.

40:20.941 --> 40:22.602
That's all right!

40:39.526 --> 40:41.517
I sure do appreciate this!

40:41.695 --> 40:43.959
Don't be ridiculous!

40:44.798 --> 40:49.132
Let's get all this back in the car.
I'm burning up.

41:13.193 --> 41:15.024
Of course I told you!

41:15.729 --> 41:17.720
Of course I told you!

41:18.732 --> 41:22.725
How can I be expected to buy it
if you don't write it down?!

41:23.003 --> 41:24.834
I'm sorry, Miss Florine.

41:30.344 --> 41:31.834
I need you.

41:32.079 --> 41:33.842
I'll be right there.

41:34.081 --> 41:37.915
Do you have any idea what it takes
to give a Christmas reception?

41:38.252 --> 41:40.243
It takes an eye for detail.

41:41.355 --> 41:44.847
I told you a million times,
Katie Bell, write it down!

41:45.192 --> 41:47.183
More I cannot do!

41:47.861 --> 41:49.522
We are out of coconut.

41:49.763 --> 41:51.594
I'm sure we can manage.

41:51.765 --> 41:54.859
- I told her.
- You didn't write it down!

41:55.269 --> 41:59.103
I don't need to stand and
listen to excuses on Christmas.

41:59.540 --> 42:04.204
You figure out how to serve ambrosia to
50 people without coconut. I give up!

42:09.616 --> 42:13.052
Don't worry, Katie Bell.
It's not quite the end of the world.

42:24.565 --> 42:28.399
Everybody's giving the Georgia
Power Company a merry Christmas.

42:29.069 --> 42:33.472
Bet Miss Florine beat them all,
especially with the new house.

42:33.740 --> 42:34.740
Absurd!

42:34.975 --> 42:39.810
If I had a nose like Florine, I wouldn't
say, "Merry Christmas" to anybody.

42:43.750 --> 42:47.584
I enjoy Christmas at their house.

42:48.889 --> 42:50.754
No wonder. You're the
only Christian in the place.

42:50.991 --> 42:52.822
They got that new cook.

42:53.093 --> 42:57.757
Florine never could keep help.
Of course, it's none of my affair.

42:58.265 --> 43:01.996
Too much running around.
The Garden Club this...

43:02.169 --> 43:05.502
...the Junior League that.
As if they'd give her the time of day.

43:05.772 --> 43:10.436
She'd die before she'd fix a glass of
iced tea for the Temple Sisterhood.

43:12.012 --> 43:16.346
I hope she doesn't take it into
her head to sing this year.

43:21.188 --> 43:24.680
Lord have mercy!
Look what Miss Florine done.

43:24.958 --> 43:28.621
If her grandfather, old man
Frietag, could see this.

43:28.962 --> 43:30.452
What is it you say?

43:30.697 --> 43:35.031
I bet he'd jump out of his
grave and snatch her baldheaded.

43:44.311 --> 43:46.973
Jump up and snatch her baldheaded.

43:48.548 --> 43:51.881
Oh, Miss Daisy, you
go on away from here.

44:00.894 --> 44:02.225
Wait a minute.

44:02.729 --> 44:04.720
This isn't a Christmas present.

44:05.832 --> 44:08.323
You know I don't give
Christmas presents.

44:09.569 --> 44:11.230
I happened to run
across it this morning.

44:12.172 --> 44:14.003
Well, go on, open it.

44:21.848 --> 44:23.179
Look at that.

44:23.417 --> 44:26.580
Ain't nobody never gave
me no book before.

44:28.522 --> 44:31.013
"Zaner Method Writing."

44:31.358 --> 44:34.418
I always taught out of these.
I saved a few.

44:35.595 --> 44:37.927
It's faded, but it works.

44:38.265 --> 44:40.597
If you practice, you'll write nicely.

44:40.867 --> 44:42.425
But you have to practice.

44:43.870 --> 44:47.203
I taught Mayor Hartsfield
out of the same book.

44:47.441 --> 44:48.999
I sure do thank you.

44:49.209 --> 44:50.870
It's not a Christmas present.

44:51.111 --> 44:54.103
Jews have no business
giving Christmas presents.

44:54.448 --> 44:57.884
You don't have to go yapping
about this to Boolie or Florine.

44:58.118 --> 44:59.949
This is between you and me.

45:01.555 --> 45:03.386
Merry Christmas, Mother Werthan.

45:03.724 --> 45:05.885
I hope I don't spit up.

45:06.226 --> 45:08.217
Merry Christmas, Mama. Hoke.

45:52.272 --> 45:54.604
She fought me on this one.

45:55.108 --> 45:57.440
But it is time for a trade.

45:58.845 --> 46:01.006
I'll bet you'll miss the old one.

46:01.281 --> 46:04.273
No, sir, I don't expect
I'll miss it that much.

46:04.618 --> 46:08.281
Come on, you're the only one
who's driven it all this time.

46:09.089 --> 46:10.571
Won't you be a little
sorry to see it go?

46:10.690 --> 46:13.682
It ain't going nowhere.
I done bought it.

46:14.027 --> 46:15.027
You didn't.

46:15.295 --> 46:18.628
I sure did. Already made the
deal with Mr. Red Mitchell.

46:18.965 --> 46:20.296
How much?

46:20.634 --> 46:23.296
That is for him and me to know.

46:23.637 --> 46:24.797
Hey, Boolie!

46:25.005 --> 46:26.700
Got a gem here.

46:27.674 --> 46:28.674
Got that paper, Hoke?

46:29.376 --> 46:30.536
I got it right here.

46:30.744 --> 46:31.938
Be right there.

46:32.646 --> 46:35.809
Why didn't you buy it from Mama?
Would have saved money.

46:36.049 --> 46:39.485
No, sir. Your mama is in my
business enough as it is.

46:39.719 --> 46:42.711
I ain't studying about making
monthly payments to her.

46:44.324 --> 46:45.382
She is mine the regular way.

46:46.960 --> 46:47.960
The Hudson's a good car.

46:47.994 --> 46:49.825
Nobody knows that better than you.

46:50.230 --> 46:52.391
Best that ever come off the line.

46:52.666 --> 46:57.000
And this here new one, if Miss
Daisy don't take to it...

46:57.404 --> 46:59.838
...l'll let her ride in this one.

47:00.240 --> 47:01.571
Mighty nice of you.

47:02.676 --> 47:04.507
We do what we can.

48:08.975 --> 48:10.806
It is three after seven.

48:11.144 --> 48:14.807
Yes, Ma'am. You said we were
leaving at fifteen to eight.

48:15.081 --> 48:17.072
At the latest, I said.

48:18.752 --> 48:23.246
What business you got dragging this
mess out of the house by yourself?

48:23.490 --> 48:25.151
Who was here to help me?

48:25.659 --> 48:27.251
Lord have mercy!

48:27.494 --> 48:30.657
It don't take more than 5
minutes to load this car.

48:30.931 --> 48:35.425
You're fixing to break your arms and
your legs before we even leave the manor.

48:35.669 --> 48:37.261
You're taking on too much.

48:37.437 --> 48:39.098
I hate doing things at the last minute.

48:39.439 --> 48:43.000
What you talking about?
Been ready to go for a week and a half.

48:43.276 --> 48:45.938
- Give me that package.
- No, don't touch that.

48:46.112 --> 48:49.275
It sure is pretty.
Is that Mr. Walter's present?

48:49.516 --> 48:52.451
Yes. It's fragile.
I'll put it on the seat.

48:54.287 --> 48:55.948
You nearly missed us.

48:56.189 --> 48:57.679
You were leaving at quarter of.

48:57.958 --> 49:00.358
- She's taking on.
- Be still!

49:01.361 --> 49:03.522
Florine bought this for Uncle Walter.

49:03.964 --> 49:05.795
Mama, it's not a snake!

49:06.032 --> 49:07.624
I think it's notepaper.

49:07.867 --> 49:11.030
How appropriate.
Uncle Walter can't see.

49:11.304 --> 49:12.532
Maybe it's soap.

49:12.706 --> 49:16.699
How nice that you take an interest
in your uncle's 90th birthday.

49:17.844 --> 49:19.141
Don't start up with me, mama...

49:19.279 --> 49:21.110
...I can't go
to Mobile with you.

49:21.247 --> 49:22.766
I have to go to New York
for a convention.

49:22.882 --> 49:24.713
The convention starts Monday.

49:24.985 --> 49:26.976
And I know what else I know.

49:27.220 --> 49:30.986
Leave Florine out of this.
She ordered those tickets 8 months ago.

49:31.157 --> 49:34.490
I'm sure "My Fair Lady" is more
important than your relatives.

49:34.995 --> 49:37.657
Those Christians will be impressed.

49:37.998 --> 49:40.228
I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

49:42.402 --> 49:45.633
- We're expected in Mobile for supper.
- You'll be there.

49:47.007 --> 49:51.171
- How will you stand her all day?
- They'll fix crab. All that trouble.

49:52.379 --> 49:53.869
She's just worked up.

49:54.047 --> 49:56.538
Here's $50 in case you have trouble.

49:56.950 --> 49:58.611
Don't show it to Mama!

49:59.285 --> 50:02.550
- Have you got a map?
- She's got it in the back seat.

50:03.790 --> 50:05.621
It's 7:16!

50:06.459 --> 50:09.394
You should have a job on the
radio announcing the time.

50:09.629 --> 50:11.722
- I want to miss rush hour.
- You will.

50:11.898 --> 50:15.459
Congratulate Uncle Walter for me
and kiss everybody in Mobile.

50:16.803 --> 50:18.134
The air conditioning...

50:18.405 --> 50:20.566
...did you check it, like I said?

50:21.141 --> 50:23.132
I got the air conditioning checked.

50:23.476 --> 50:26.639
I don't know why.
You never let me turn it on!

50:26.813 --> 50:27.973
Hush up!

50:33.486 --> 50:34.976
Good luck!

50:35.922 --> 50:37.412
Good God!

50:57.010 --> 50:58.341
Turn left.

50:59.512 --> 51:01.844
No, right! Turn right!

51:44.491 --> 51:47.824
Did I ever tell you about the
first time I left Georgia?

51:48.061 --> 51:49.392
When was that?

51:50.163 --> 51:51.562
A few minutes back!

51:51.831 --> 51:53.162
Go on!

51:54.234 --> 51:55.394
My daughter...

51:55.668 --> 51:58.159
...is married to a Pullman porter.

51:58.671 --> 52:00.832
She is always on the go.

52:01.241 --> 52:05.075
New York, Detroit, St. Lois.

52:06.679 --> 52:09.580
I say, "That's all well
and good, Tommie Lee...

52:09.916 --> 52:12.407
...but I don't feel the need for it."

52:13.253 --> 52:14.914
So here it is.

52:15.421 --> 52:16.911
The first time.

52:17.924 --> 52:19.915
And I might tell you, Miss Daisy...

52:20.927 --> 52:23.691
...Alabama is not
looking like much so far!

52:56.629 --> 52:59.291
Idella sure does stuff eggs good!

52:59.566 --> 53:01.727
You stuff yourself good.

53:12.078 --> 53:15.411
I was thinking about the
first time I went to Mobile.

53:16.082 --> 53:19.643
It was Walter's wedding: 1888.

53:19.986 --> 53:24.252
1888! You were nothing
but a little bitty thing.

53:24.490 --> 53:26.151
I was 12.

53:26.759 --> 53:28.750
We went on the train.

53:29.095 --> 53:31.256
Oh, I was so excited.

53:32.599 --> 53:34.829
I'd never been in a wedding party.

53:35.168 --> 53:37.329
I had never seen the ocean.

53:39.339 --> 53:44.174
Papa said it was the Gulf of Mexico, not
the ocean, but it was all the same to me.

53:47.013 --> 53:51.848
I asked Papa if it was all right
for me to dip my hand in the water.

53:53.186 --> 53:56.349
And he laughed because I was so timid.

53:59.525 --> 54:03.188
And then I tasted the
salt water on my fingers.

54:07.867 --> 54:10.700
Isn't that a silly thing to remember?

54:11.537 --> 54:13.732
No sillier than most of
what folks remember.

54:15.308 --> 54:16.468
Boy!

54:19.212 --> 54:21.373
What are you doing with this car?

54:21.981 --> 54:23.642
This is my car, officer.

54:24.217 --> 54:28.813
Can I see your registration,
please, and your license, boy.

54:40.333 --> 54:42.665
What's this name? Wertheran?

54:43.002 --> 54:44.162
Werthan.

54:44.904 --> 54:47.236
Never heard that one.
What is it?

54:47.507 --> 54:49.498
It is of German derivation.

54:50.410 --> 54:52.071
German derivation.

55:08.294 --> 55:09.522
Thank you, ma'am.

55:45.631 --> 55:49.965
An old nigger and an old Jew woman
riding down the road together.

55:50.403 --> 55:52.564
Now that is one sorry sight.

56:03.483 --> 56:04.643
Oh, my God!

56:04.984 --> 56:07.475
The sign says Phenix City 30 miles.

56:07.754 --> 56:11.246
We're not supposed to go to
Phenix City! Oh, my God!

56:11.491 --> 56:12.822
Maybe you read it wrong.

56:13.159 --> 56:16.993
I didn't. Stop the car. Stop the car!

56:17.330 --> 56:19.161
Lord have mercy.

56:29.175 --> 56:33.111
Here. You took the
wrong turn at Opelika.

56:33.346 --> 56:37.009
You took it with me, Miss Daisy.
And you got the map.

56:37.350 --> 56:40.342
I was getting the lunch!
Go on back. My God!

56:40.620 --> 56:43.783
It aint' more than 30
minutes since we turned.

57:25.398 --> 57:27.559
They fixed crab for me.

57:28.067 --> 57:31.400
Minnie always fixes crab.
They go to so much trouble.

57:31.671 --> 57:33.502
It's all ruined by now.

57:36.242 --> 57:38.233
We going to have to pull over.

57:38.444 --> 57:40.036
What's wrong with the car?

57:40.413 --> 57:42.404
There ain't nothing wrong with the car.

57:42.682 --> 57:44.673
I got to be excused.

57:46.686 --> 57:48.586
I got to go make water.

57:49.522 --> 57:52.252
You should have thought of
that at the service station.

57:52.525 --> 57:57.189
You know colored can't use the toilet
at any service station, Miss Daisy.

57:57.430 --> 58:01.264
There's no time to stop.
We'll be in Mobile soon. You can wait.

58:07.373 --> 58:08.373
No, ma'am.

58:11.210 --> 58:14.373
- I told you to wait!
- I heard what you said.

58:17.049 --> 58:21.042
How do you think I feel having to
ask you can I go make water...

58:21.220 --> 58:22.881
...like I am some child.

58:23.556 --> 58:24.887
I'd be ashamed.

58:25.124 --> 58:27.285
I ain't no child, Miss Daisy.

58:27.793 --> 58:32.560
And I ain't just a back of the neck you
look at while you go where you got to go.

58:32.965 --> 58:37.402
I am a man. I'm near 70 years old.
And I know when my bladder's full.

58:39.071 --> 58:41.130
Now I'm going to get out of this car...

58:41.307 --> 58:44.140
...and go over there
and do what I got to do.

58:44.911 --> 58:48.904
And I'm taking the key with me, too.
Now that's all there is to it!

59:15.942 --> 59:17.102
Hoke!

59:26.519 --> 59:27.519
Hoke!

59:33.292 --> 59:34.292
Hoke?

59:48.641 --> 59:50.370
You all right, Miss Daisy?

59:51.377 --> 59:52.867
Of course I am.

59:57.283 --> 01:00:01.276
Is that you, Slick? It's Boolie.
How you doing?

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.114
Congratulations on your dad's big day.

01:00:04.523 --> 01:00:07.492
Thank you, Boolie. Thank you.
Aunt Daisy!

01:00:12.531 --> 01:00:14.123
It's Boolie on the phone.

01:00:17.803 --> 01:00:19.293
Hey, son!

01:00:19.805 --> 01:00:22.365
Uncle Walter appreciates your call.

01:00:22.642 --> 01:00:25.042
I don't think he can come to the phone.

01:00:25.311 --> 01:00:26.972
Fine. How's Hoke?

01:00:27.146 --> 01:00:29.137
What do you mean?
How should he be?

01:00:30.216 --> 01:00:32.047
Happy birthday, Uncle Walter.

01:00:32.318 --> 01:00:34.149
I got to hang up now, Boolie.

01:00:34.654 --> 01:00:36.144
Yeah, I'll tell him.

01:00:38.391 --> 01:00:41.224
For he's a jolly good fellow.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.552
Which nobody can deny!

01:01:21.934 --> 01:01:23.265
Morning, Miss McClatchey.

01:01:24.937 --> 01:01:26.928
Well, good morning to you.

01:01:28.874 --> 01:01:29.932
Can I see him?

01:01:30.776 --> 01:01:32.767
It's Mr. Sinclair Harris, sir.

01:01:33.112 --> 01:01:34.704
My cousin Sinclair?

01:01:34.947 --> 01:01:38.610
His wife... The one that talk funny.

01:01:38.951 --> 01:01:40.942
She's from Canton, Ohio.

01:01:42.288 --> 01:01:43.778
She's trying to hire me.

01:01:45.558 --> 01:01:48.049
- What?!
- Yes, sir. She said:

01:01:48.294 --> 01:01:50.455
"How they treating you
down there, Hoke?"

01:01:50.730 --> 01:01:53.563
You know how she sound,
like her nose stuffed up.

01:01:53.799 --> 01:01:57.132
So I said, "Fine, Mrs. Harris,
just fine, thank you."

01:01:57.403 --> 01:02:01.396
She said, "Well, you looking for
a change, you know who to call."

01:02:01.807 --> 01:02:03.468
I'll be damned!

01:02:03.809 --> 01:02:06.141
I thought you ought to know about it.

01:02:06.746 --> 01:02:08.407
I'll be goddamned.

01:02:08.647 --> 01:02:10.308
Ain't she a mess?

01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:13.582
Said, "Name your own salary."

01:02:16.322 --> 01:02:19.655
I see. And did you?

01:02:21.494 --> 01:02:22.494
Did I what?

01:02:22.762 --> 01:02:26.596
- Name your own salary?
- Go away. What you think I am?

01:02:26.832 --> 01:02:30.996
I ain't studying working for
no trashy something like her.

01:02:32.338 --> 01:02:35.000
But she got you thinking, didn't she?

01:02:35.274 --> 01:02:37.936
Well, sir, you might say that.

01:02:40.446 --> 01:02:42.107
Name your salary.

01:02:42.782 --> 01:02:44.613
That's exactly what she said.

01:02:46.619 --> 01:02:50.111
Well, how does $65 a week sound?

01:02:51.624 --> 01:02:53.455
Sounds pretty good, sir.

01:02:54.193 --> 01:02:57.685
Course, $75 sounds better.

01:02:59.198 --> 01:03:00.790
It sure does!

01:03:04.036 --> 01:03:05.526
Beginning this week.

01:03:08.541 --> 01:03:10.532
That's mighty nice of you.

01:03:10.810 --> 01:03:12.971
I sure appreciate this. Thank you.

01:03:17.383 --> 01:03:19.374
You ever have folks fighting over you?

01:03:20.653 --> 01:03:21.813
No.

01:03:23.322 --> 01:03:25.051
It sure feels good.

01:03:33.232 --> 01:03:34.563
One dot.

01:03:39.905 --> 01:03:41.236
Nine dot.

01:03:44.243 --> 01:03:45.243
Two dot.

01:03:45.845 --> 01:03:46.903
Mah jongg.

01:03:47.246 --> 01:03:49.737
You are the luckiest thing, Beulah!

01:03:52.184 --> 01:03:53.184
Excuse me.

01:04:06.699 --> 01:04:09.190
I don't know how you can look at that.

01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:14.032
See it a few times, you get in it.

01:04:14.874 --> 01:04:17.707
Both your brains are
fixing to evaporate.

01:04:18.944 --> 01:04:20.935
You can bring the cake now, Hoke.

01:04:21.714 --> 01:04:23.875
Don't make a mess with those peas.

01:04:24.116 --> 01:04:25.777
Do I ever?

01:04:26.785 --> 01:04:30.277
Lord have mercy, look at that.
Ain't she got a lot of hair?

01:04:30.623 --> 01:04:32.386
How she get it so shiny?

01:04:32.625 --> 01:04:34.388
Washes it in mayonnaise.

01:04:35.227 --> 01:04:38.060
- Go on away from here, Idella!
- Yes, she did.

01:04:38.297 --> 01:04:40.288
I read it in Life magazine.

01:04:41.967 --> 01:04:43.798
Don't seem human, does it?

01:04:44.403 --> 01:04:47.133
He will tear you to shreds!

01:04:47.473 --> 01:04:51.136
I am not going into that court.
And I'm not giving in!

01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:53.901
You are at the end of your rope.

01:04:54.146 --> 01:04:56.637
You murdered Carlson.
You have to pay!

01:04:56.916 --> 01:05:01.751
Either choose the easy way out,
or you go into the courtroom...

01:05:01.987 --> 01:05:04.820
...and let them carve you
into pathetic little bits.

01:05:05.157 --> 01:05:07.990
You have a minute to make up your mind.

01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:14.822
What happened? She up to
something, ain't she?

01:06:55.934 --> 01:06:58.767
- You fixing to ruin it.
- What are you talking about?

01:06:59.038 --> 01:07:02.872
You got the chicken too close
together and the fire is too high.

01:07:03.042 --> 01:07:04.600
Mind your business.

01:07:05.444 --> 01:07:07.776
It's your chicken.

01:07:29.735 --> 01:07:31.066
Thank you, Hoke.

01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:33.461
Now you enjoy it.

01:07:52.758 --> 01:07:54.089
Amen.

01:09:29.921 --> 01:09:31.082
Who is it?

01:09:31.356 --> 01:09:33.187
Morning, Miss Daisy.

01:09:35.527 --> 01:09:37.688
What in the world...?

01:09:39.932 --> 01:09:44.426
I learned how to drive on ice when
I delivered milk for the dairy.

01:09:45.037 --> 01:09:46.698
Ain't nothing to it.

01:09:47.372 --> 01:09:51.536
Other folks are banging into each
other like they're in the funny papers.

01:09:53.377 --> 01:09:57.712
I figured your stove was out, so
I stopped by the Krispy Kreme.

01:09:57.916 --> 01:10:00.749
I know you got to have
coffee in the morning.

01:10:01.353 --> 01:10:03.344
How sweet of you, Hoke.

01:10:05.924 --> 01:10:10.020
We ain't had any good coffee
around here since Idella passed.

01:10:10.762 --> 01:10:12.753
I can fix her biscuits.

01:10:13.098 --> 01:10:15.589
We both can make her fried chicken.

01:10:16.034 --> 01:10:17.763
But nobody can make Idella's coffee.

01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:20.101
Ain't that the truth?

01:10:25.944 --> 01:10:27.775
Idella was lucky.

01:10:33.785 --> 01:10:35.616
I expect she was.

01:10:50.636 --> 01:10:52.126
Where are you going?

01:10:53.071 --> 01:10:55.471
I'm just going to take these things off.

01:10:55.974 --> 01:10:59.466
I don't know what you can do here
today, except keep me company.

01:11:01.813 --> 01:11:04.145
Then I'll see if I can make us a fire.

01:11:06.251 --> 01:11:08.742
Eat anything you want
out of the ice box.

01:11:09.254 --> 01:11:11.415
It will all spoil, anyway.

01:11:12.658 --> 01:11:16.492
And wipe up what you
tracked onto my floor.

01:11:16.762 --> 01:11:19.424
What do you think I am, a mess?

01:11:23.001 --> 01:11:24.491
Mama, I'll be right out...

01:11:24.670 --> 01:11:27.104
...when I can get down my own driveway.

01:11:27.339 --> 01:11:30.001
Stay home, Boolie.
Hoke is here with me.

01:11:30.275 --> 01:11:31.765
How'd he manage that?

01:11:32.010 --> 01:11:36.174
He's very handy. I'm fine.
I don't need a thing in the world.

01:11:36.448 --> 01:11:40.509
Hello? I have the wrong number.
Mama's saying loving things about Hoke.

01:11:41.453 --> 01:11:44.616
I didn't say I love him.
I said he was handy.

01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:50.125
Honestly! Are you trying to irritate
me in the middle of an ice storm?

01:11:55.701 --> 01:11:57.191
Thank you, Wellborn.

01:11:57.869 --> 01:11:59.200
Thank you all.

01:12:00.138 --> 01:12:04.131
I am deeply grateful to be
chosen 1966 Man of the Year...

01:12:04.376 --> 01:12:06.537
...by the Atlanta Business Council.

01:12:06.878 --> 01:12:09.711
An honor I've seen bestowed
on mighty fine fellows.

01:12:09.982 --> 01:12:12.644
And one I never expected
would come to me.

01:12:13.552 --> 01:12:16.544
I'm afraid that my loss up here...

01:12:16.888 --> 01:12:19.049
...and my gain down here...

01:12:19.224 --> 01:12:22.557
...have given me an air of
competence that I don't possess.

01:12:23.495 --> 01:12:27.659
I will tell you that I wish my father
and grandfather could see this.

01:12:27.899 --> 01:12:32.233
About 72 years ago, they leased
an old mill up on Decatur Road...

01:12:32.571 --> 01:12:35.233
...with I believe 25 looms in operation.

01:12:35.574 --> 01:12:37.735
They managed to grow with Atlanta.

01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:42.674
And Werthan Industries believes that
what we want is what Atlanta wants.

01:12:43.081 --> 01:12:47.074
And this award proves
that we were right.

01:12:47.352 --> 01:12:48.683
I thank you.

01:13:19.284 --> 01:13:20.444
Well?

01:13:21.787 --> 01:13:24.449
What is it? What took you so long?

01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:29.124
I couldn't help it.
There's a big mess up yonder.

01:13:29.394 --> 01:13:33.728
What's the matter? I might as
well not go to temple at all!

01:13:33.965 --> 01:13:38.459
No, ma'am, you ain't going to get to
the temple this morning, Miss Daisy.

01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:41.432
Why not? What's the matter with you?

01:13:43.475 --> 01:13:45.739
Somebody has bombed the temple.

01:13:46.311 --> 01:13:49.303
What? Bombed the temple?

01:13:50.482 --> 01:13:52.814
That's how come
we stuck here so long.

01:13:53.085 --> 01:13:54.746
I don't believe it!

01:13:55.087 --> 01:13:57.317
That's what the policeman just said.

01:14:00.826 --> 01:14:04.819
Oh, my God. Was anybody there?
Were people hurt?

01:14:05.097 --> 01:14:07.497
I don't know. He didn't say.

01:14:07.833 --> 01:14:09.994
Who would do such a thing?

01:14:11.002 --> 01:14:15.837
You know good as me, Miss Daisy.
It always be the same ones.

01:14:37.696 --> 01:14:40.688
I remember one time back
down there in Macon.

01:14:41.032 --> 01:14:45.366
Lord, I couldn't've been more than
10 or 11 years old, I reckon.

01:14:45.871 --> 01:14:48.203
I had this friend named Porter.

01:14:48.807 --> 01:14:52.470
One day there his daddy
was hanging from a tree.

01:14:52.711 --> 01:14:57.148
Now just the day before, we'd
all been pitching horseshoes.

01:14:57.482 --> 01:15:01.976
Laughing and carrying on and
talking about how me and Porter...

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:05.553
...was going to have strong
right arms, just like him.

01:15:06.725 --> 01:15:10.661
Lord, there he was.
Hanging up yonder in the tree.

01:15:10.896 --> 01:15:15.390
Had his hand tied behind him.
Flies was all over him.

01:15:15.901 --> 01:15:19.064
I tell you, I threw up
where I was standing.

01:15:21.239 --> 01:15:22.831
You go on and cry.

01:15:24.676 --> 01:15:26.234
I'm not crying.

01:15:28.513 --> 01:15:30.504
Why did you tell me that story?

01:15:31.416 --> 01:15:33.748
Lord, I don't know, Miss Daisy.

01:15:34.085 --> 01:15:37.418
That mess back there
put me in mind of it.

01:15:37.689 --> 01:15:40.749
Ridiculous! The temple
has nothing to do with it!

01:15:41.026 --> 01:15:42.516
Yes, ma'am, if you say so.

01:15:42.761 --> 01:15:46.720
We don't know. Maybe that
policeman wasn't telling the truth.

01:15:46.932 --> 01:15:50.265
Why would he go and lie
about a thing like that?

01:15:50.702 --> 01:15:52.533
You never get things right!

01:15:52.704 --> 01:15:56.367
Miss Daisy, somebody done bombed
that temple and you know it!

01:15:56.575 --> 01:15:58.975
I don't want to hear anymore about it!

01:16:01.279 --> 01:16:04.271
- You the boss.
- Don't talk to me!

01:16:25.804 --> 01:16:28.466
- Where are you?
- Up here!

01:16:37.649 --> 01:16:40.311
Hello, Mama. How are you feeling?

01:16:40.652 --> 01:16:44.144
Not a good question to
ask somebody nearly 90!

01:16:44.656 --> 01:16:46.317
Well, you look fine.

01:16:46.591 --> 01:16:48.821
It's my ageless appeal!

01:16:50.495 --> 01:16:52.588
Miss McClatchey gave me your message.

01:16:52.831 --> 01:16:54.822
Florine is invited, too.

01:16:55.166 --> 01:16:56.166
Thank you.

01:16:56.434 --> 01:16:59.767
I guess Hoke should drive us.
There'll be a crowd.

01:17:00.438 --> 01:17:02.668
Mama, we have to talk about this.

01:17:02.941 --> 01:17:04.431
About what?

01:17:04.676 --> 01:17:06.837
About the feasibility of all this.

01:17:07.112 --> 01:17:11.105
I believe Martin Luther King has
done some mighty fine things.

01:17:11.449 --> 01:17:14.941
If you don't want to go,
why don't you just say so?

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:18.283
I want to go! You know
how I feel about him.

01:17:18.456 --> 01:17:20.117
Of course, but Florine...

01:17:20.358 --> 01:17:24.351
Florine has nothing to do with it.
I still have to do business here.

01:17:24.629 --> 01:17:29.464
I see. Werthan Bag will go out of
business if you attend the King dinner.

01:17:29.701 --> 01:17:34.638
Not exactly. But a lot of men I do
business with would not like it!

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.371
They might...

01:17:37.375 --> 01:17:39.036
...snicker a little.

01:17:40.145 --> 01:17:43.308
Call me Martin Luther
Werthan behind my back.

01:17:46.651 --> 01:17:49.984
Maybe I wouldn't hear
about meetings at the Club.

01:17:50.555 --> 01:17:55.219
Old Jack Raphael at Ideal Mills, he's a
New York Jew instead of a Georgia Jew.

01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:58.823
All the really smart ones come
from New York, don't they?

01:17:59.397 --> 01:18:04.164
Some might throw their business to Jack
instead of old Martin Luther Werthan.

01:18:05.503 --> 01:18:08.904
I don't know.
Maybe it wouldn't happen.

01:18:09.507 --> 01:18:12.169
And sometimes that's
the way things work.

01:18:13.511 --> 01:18:17.174
Anyway, if we don't use those
seats, somebody else will.

01:18:17.582 --> 01:18:21.348
If we do not use those seats?
I'm not supposed to go, either?

01:18:21.686 --> 01:18:23.347
You can do whatever you want.

01:18:23.588 --> 01:18:25.579
Thanks for your permission.

01:18:26.424 --> 01:18:28.016
Can I ask you something?

01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:33.195
When did you get so fired up about
Martin Luther King?

01:18:33.531 --> 01:18:34.691
Why, Boolie!

01:18:34.933 --> 01:18:38.425
I've never been prejudiced
in my life and you know it.

01:18:39.938 --> 01:18:42.099
Then ask Hoke to go with you.

01:18:42.941 --> 01:18:45.102
Don't be ridiculous. He wouldn't go.

01:18:46.778 --> 01:18:48.370
Ask him and see.

01:19:04.129 --> 01:19:05.460
All right!

01:19:47.572 --> 01:19:50.564
Boolie said the silliest
thing the other day.

01:19:53.645 --> 01:19:55.010
What did he say?

01:19:55.513 --> 01:19:58.141
He was talking about Martin Luther Ling.

01:19:58.750 --> 01:20:00.809
I guess you know him, don't you?

01:20:01.019 --> 01:20:03.317
King? No, ma'am.
I don't know him.

01:20:03.655 --> 01:20:05.520
I was sure you did.

01:20:05.824 --> 01:20:07.519
But you've heard him preach?

01:20:07.759 --> 01:20:12.253
Yes, Ma'am, same way you have.
On the TV.

01:20:12.831 --> 01:20:14.822
I think he's wonderful.

01:20:20.171 --> 01:20:23.038
- What you getting at?
- It's so silly.

01:20:23.274 --> 01:20:27.836
Boolie says you wanted to go with me
to this dinner. Did you tell him that?

01:20:28.613 --> 01:20:29.613
No, I didn't.

01:20:29.781 --> 01:20:34.548
I didn't think so. What'd be the point?
You can hear him whenever you want.

01:20:36.054 --> 01:20:39.353
I think it's wonderful the
way things are changing.

01:20:59.477 --> 01:21:02.640
Now what you think
I am, Miss Daisy?

01:21:02.814 --> 01:21:03.940
What do you mean?

01:21:04.148 --> 01:21:05.979
The invitation to this dinner...

01:21:06.084 --> 01:21:07.813
...came in the mail a month ago.

01:21:08.152 --> 01:21:11.986
Now, if did be you wanted
me to go with you...

01:21:12.323 --> 01:21:16.316
...how come you wait 'till we in the
car on the way before you asked me?

01:21:16.494 --> 01:21:20.487
What? All I said was Boolie
said you wanted to go.

01:21:21.232 --> 01:21:25.225
Next time you want me to go
somewhere ask me regular.

01:21:25.503 --> 01:21:27.494
You don't have to carry on so much.

01:21:27.739 --> 01:21:30.003
Let's just leave it alone.

01:21:30.341 --> 01:21:31.501
Honestly!

01:21:35.747 --> 01:21:39.740
Talk about things changing.
They ain't changed all that much.

01:21:47.125 --> 01:21:48.422
I'll help you.

01:21:48.693 --> 01:21:51.685
Thank you, Hoke, I can help myself.

01:22:00.939 --> 01:22:04.272
...can see that the South
has marvelous possibilities.

01:22:05.443 --> 01:22:07.877
Yet in spite of these assets...

01:22:08.212 --> 01:22:10.703
...segregation has placed the South...

01:22:10.949 --> 01:22:15.784
...socially, educationally, and
economically behind the rest of the nation.

01:22:16.454 --> 01:22:21.153
Yet there are in the white South
millions of people of good will...

01:22:21.659 --> 01:22:24.457
...whose voices are yet unheard...

01:22:25.163 --> 01:22:27.791
...whose course is yet unclear...

01:22:28.466 --> 01:22:31.458
...and whose courageous
acts are yet unseen.

01:22:32.170 --> 01:22:34.968
These millions are called upon...

01:22:35.573 --> 01:22:38.736
...to gird their courage,
to speak out...

01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:42.243
...to offer leadership that is needed.

01:22:42.313 --> 01:22:44.474
History will have to record...

01:22:44.749 --> 01:22:48.241
...that the greatest tragedy of
this period of social transition...

01:22:48.586 --> 01:22:53.421
...was not the vitriolic words and the
violent actions of the bad people...

01:22:53.992 --> 01:22:58.486
...but the appalling silence and
indifference of the good people.

01:22:58.830 --> 01:23:01.196
And our generation
will have to repent...

01:23:01.432 --> 01:23:04.924
...not only for the words and acts
of the children of darkness...

01:23:05.269 --> 01:23:10.104
...but also for the fears and
apathy of the children of light.

01:23:38.236 --> 01:23:40.033
Morning, Miss Daisy.

01:24:10.535 --> 01:24:11.535
Miss Daisy?

01:24:16.674 --> 01:24:18.835
Hoke, is that Hoke?

01:24:19.277 --> 01:24:21.404
It's me. You all right?

01:24:22.413 --> 01:24:25.507
Hoke, what did I do with my papers?

01:24:26.084 --> 01:24:29.576
My papers! I had them all
corrected last night...

01:24:30.021 --> 01:24:33.354
...and I put them where I wouldn't
forget them on my way to school.

01:24:33.591 --> 01:24:34.785
What did you do with them?

01:24:34.926 --> 01:24:36.587
What are you talking about?

01:24:36.861 --> 01:24:40.695
The children will be disappointed if
I don't give them their homework.

01:24:40.932 --> 01:24:43.924
I always give it back the next day.

01:24:44.302 --> 01:24:45.929
That's why they like me.

01:24:46.104 --> 01:24:47.594
You talking out your head.

01:24:47.805 --> 01:24:49.602
Why aren't you helping me?

01:24:50.108 --> 01:24:51.700
What'll I do?

01:24:51.943 --> 01:24:54.309
Find those papers. I told you.

01:24:55.713 --> 01:24:58.876
It's all right if you moved them.
I won't be mad.

01:24:59.117 --> 01:25:02.314
But I've got to get to school.
I'll be late.

01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:07.319
Who will take care of my class?
They'll be all alone. Oh, God!

01:25:07.558 --> 01:25:09.219
I do everything wrong!

01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:13.123
Now set down in here. You're
going to fall and hurt yourself.

01:25:14.232 --> 01:25:18.726
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.
I didn't do right.

01:25:20.138 --> 01:25:21.628
It's so awful!

01:25:21.906 --> 01:25:25.069
Ain't nothing awful except
the way you carrying on.

01:25:25.243 --> 01:25:26.904
It's all my fault.

01:25:27.145 --> 01:25:29.841
I can't find the papers.
The children are waiting.

01:25:30.081 --> 01:25:33.414
There ain't nobody waiting on you.
You ain't a teacher.

01:25:33.651 --> 01:25:35.642
It doesn't make any difference.

01:25:35.987 --> 01:25:38.922
Now listen, there ain't
nothing wrong with you!

01:25:39.157 --> 01:25:40.351
You don't know.

01:25:57.141 --> 01:25:58.472
This Hoke here.

01:25:59.477 --> 01:26:00.307
What can I do for you?

01:26:00.378 --> 01:26:01.675
It's your mama.

01:26:01.879 --> 01:26:02.937
What's wrong?

01:26:03.181 --> 01:26:05.012
She's taking on something awful.

01:26:05.616 --> 01:26:07.880
Why's today different
from any other day?

01:26:08.519 --> 01:26:10.384
No, sir. It's not the same.

01:26:12.089 --> 01:26:13.579
I'll be right there.

01:26:17.528 --> 01:26:21.521
Miss Daisy, now there ain't
nothing wrong with you!

01:26:21.899 --> 01:26:24.390
Your mind done took a turn this morning.

01:26:24.635 --> 01:26:27.035
You'll snap back if you let yourself.

01:26:27.305 --> 01:26:29.466
I can't! I can't!

01:26:30.308 --> 01:26:32.208
You're a lucky old woman.

01:26:32.410 --> 01:26:36.904
No! It's all a mess now, and
I can't do anything about it.

01:26:37.215 --> 01:26:41.208
Now look at you. You rich,
you well for your time.

01:26:41.652 --> 01:26:44.485
You got folks who care
what happens to you.

01:26:44.722 --> 01:26:48.214
I am being trouble. I don't
want to be trouble to anybody.

01:26:48.492 --> 01:26:51.825
You want something to cry about,
I'll run you to the state home...

01:26:52.063 --> 01:26:54.429
...let you see what's laying out there.

01:26:54.732 --> 01:26:58.498
I bet there ain't one of them
carrying on the way you doing.

01:26:58.736 --> 01:27:01.933
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Those poor children.

01:27:02.506 --> 01:27:07.068
You keep this up and Mr. Werthan's
going to call that doctor on you.

01:27:07.178 --> 01:27:12.081
Just as sure as you born, that doctor is
going to have you out in that asylum.

01:27:12.583 --> 01:27:15.575
Now is that the way you want it to be?

01:27:23.027 --> 01:27:25.359
Do you still have that Hudson?

01:27:27.365 --> 01:27:30.266
You talking about from
when I first come here?

01:27:31.769 --> 01:27:33.100
No, Miss Daisy.

01:27:33.371 --> 01:27:38.035
That thing been in the junkyard now...
more than 15 years.

01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:42.543
I'm driving your next to last car now.

01:27:43.047 --> 01:27:45.379
1965 Cadillac.

01:27:45.716 --> 01:27:48.207
It's running fine as wine, too.

01:27:50.388 --> 01:27:54.381
You ought not to be driving
anything the way you see.

01:27:54.692 --> 01:27:59.527
Now, how you know how I can see
'less'n you can look out my eyes.

01:28:08.639 --> 01:28:10.300
You're my best friend.

01:28:10.508 --> 01:28:12.999
- Go on now, Miss Daisy.
- No, really.

01:28:13.744 --> 01:28:15.075
You are.

01:28:20.251 --> 01:28:21.582
You are.

01:30:12.129 --> 01:30:14.290
Well, Hoke, good to see you!

01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:19.634
- You didn't drive yourself here?
- No, sir. I don't drive now.

01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:21.804
My granddaughter drove me.

01:30:22.039 --> 01:30:24.530
My Lord, is she old enough to drive?

01:30:24.875 --> 01:30:27.810
Michelle is nigh on 37 years old now.

01:30:28.312 --> 01:30:32.476
She's teaching biology at
yonder Spelman College.

01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:34.047
I never knew that.

01:30:39.824 --> 01:30:44.158
Seems mighty funny to sell the
house while Mama's still alive.

01:30:44.662 --> 01:30:47.153
Yes, sir, I imagine it do.

01:30:47.998 --> 01:30:51.490
But she hasn't been inside
the door for two years.

01:30:51.902 --> 01:30:53.267
I know.

01:30:54.171 --> 01:30:56.662
I suppose you don't see her very much.

01:30:56.907 --> 01:30:58.898
No, sir, I don't.

01:30:59.577 --> 01:31:02.910
It's hard, not driving, Mr. Werthan.

01:31:03.347 --> 01:31:06.077
There's no bus that goes out yonder.

01:31:06.417 --> 01:31:10.786
Course, I take a taxicab
as often as I can.

01:31:11.355 --> 01:31:13.016
I' m sure she appreciates it.

01:31:15.526 --> 01:31:18.859
Some days she's better than others.

01:31:20.698 --> 01:31:22.859
But then, who ain't?

01:32:08.412 --> 01:32:10.073
Happy Thanksgiving, Mama!

01:32:11.415 --> 01:32:13.076
Look who I brought!

01:32:14.151 --> 01:32:15.982
Morning, Miss Daisy.

01:32:17.922 --> 01:32:20.413
You been keeping yourself busy?

01:32:22.092 --> 01:32:25.425
She certainly has.
She goes to jewelry making...

01:32:25.663 --> 01:32:27.358
How many times a week?

01:32:28.165 --> 01:32:30.861
She makes all kinds of things.
Pins, bracelets...

01:32:31.769 --> 01:32:33.259
She's a regular Tiffany's.

01:32:33.504 --> 01:32:35.369
Isn't that something!

01:32:40.611 --> 01:32:42.272
Are you all right, Mama?

01:32:47.284 --> 01:32:50.117
Hoke, I thought of you the other day.

01:32:51.288 --> 01:32:54.018
- I saw an Avondale milk truck.
- Is that right?

01:32:54.291 --> 01:32:57.692
A big monster of a thing.
Must've had about 16 wheels.

01:32:57.962 --> 01:32:59.452
Go on away from here.

01:32:59.697 --> 01:33:02.894
I wondered how you'd have
liked driving that around.

01:33:04.134 --> 01:33:06.967
Hoke came to see me, not you.

01:33:09.506 --> 01:33:11.667
This is one of her good days.

01:33:13.043 --> 01:33:17.980
Mama, Florine said to wish you a happy
Thanksgiving. She's in Washington.

01:33:19.316 --> 01:33:22.308
She's a Republican National
Committeewoman now.

01:33:22.653 --> 01:33:24.052
Good God!

01:33:30.995 --> 01:33:33.327
Go charm the nurses!

01:33:36.667 --> 01:33:38.828
She wants you all to herself.

01:33:40.337 --> 01:33:41.929
You are a doodle, Mama.

01:34:02.026 --> 01:34:04.017
Boolie paying you still?

01:34:05.362 --> 01:34:06.693
Every week.

01:34:06.864 --> 01:34:08.195
How much?

01:34:08.465 --> 01:34:11.263
Now that's between him and me.

01:34:11.869 --> 01:34:13.860
Highway robbery!

01:34:16.707 --> 01:34:18.368
It sure is.

01:34:21.612 --> 01:34:23.273
It sure is.

01:34:27.384 --> 01:34:28.874
How are you?

01:34:31.889 --> 01:34:34.050
I'm doing the best I can.

01:34:36.493 --> 01:34:37.790
Me, too.

01:34:40.497 --> 01:34:44.297
Well, that's about all
there is to it then.

01:34:53.744 --> 01:34:55.075
Look it here.

01:34:55.913 --> 01:34:58.905
You didn't eat your Thanksgiving pie.

01:35:02.319 --> 01:35:03.650
Go on now.

01:35:06.924 --> 01:35:09.085
Here, let me help you.

01:35:25.275 --> 01:35:26.435
Is it good?

01:35:32.116 --> 01:35:33.777
Here comes some more.
