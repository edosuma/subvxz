01:11.055 --> 01:13.958
Did your brother say he was
joining us for lunch?

01:13.991 --> 01:15.325
Yeah.
He said maybe.

01:22.166 --> 01:23.234
- What is that?
- What?

01:23.267 --> 01:24.936
- What is going on?
- Do you feel that?

01:24.969 --> 01:26.204
I feel shaky.

01:48.425 --> 01:49.827
Headquarters.

01:50.261 --> 01:51.329
A what?

02:11.014 --> 02:12.049
Come in here.

02:31.969 --> 02:34.738
All right. How's that smoke?
Good? All right.

02:34.772 --> 02:37.440
Here we go.
Full tight on the monster. Rolling.

02:37.474 --> 02:41.678
Is me being pulled in
only that much to the table, it's fine?

02:41.711 --> 02:44.514
But the main thing is
we need to hide your body more.

02:53.723 --> 02:56.961
Wee Man! Whoa!
Wee Man!

03:03.367 --> 03:05.870
Fucking look!
Wee Man, right there!

03:18.416 --> 03:19.516
Ow!

03:27.758 --> 03:29.026
Oh!

03:45.409 --> 03:46.978
There! Fire!

03:55.953 --> 03:57.188
What?

03:57.221 --> 03:58.222
Whoo!

04:02.492 --> 04:03.995
Fire this way!

04:09.433 --> 04:10.935
Fire! Shoot it!

05:18.803 --> 05:21.138
Oh... settle down, big fella.

05:22.106 --> 05:24.241
This is all just a big
misunderstanding.

05:24.975 --> 05:27.511
We can work this out
like pals.

05:27.545 --> 05:30.147
Settle! Settle! Set...

05:48.399 --> 05:51.936
Oh, no! Oh, no!

06:05.015 --> 06:08.185
Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville!
Welcome to <i>Jackass!</i>

06:18.661 --> 06:21.799
Hey. Steve-O, how does it
feel to be on set 20 years later?

06:22.732 --> 06:24.201
Man, it's uh...

06:26.837 --> 06:28.906
...it's pretty heavy, dude.

06:28.939 --> 06:32.642
You think about how the last movie
had, like, the credits,

06:32.675 --> 06:36.013
which showed us when we first
started and it was ten years later...

06:36.046 --> 06:38.883
- Yeah.
- And now it's another ten years.

06:38.916 --> 06:40.451
I gotta say, I look great,
though.

06:40.484 --> 06:41.585
You look 20 millions...

06:41.619 --> 06:43.621
Yeah.

06:43.653 --> 06:45.289
That's how my dogs
jumped up on the...

06:45.322 --> 06:47.925
The big one lays down and the
little one gets on top there.

06:48.359 --> 06:49.426
Lance.

06:53.564 --> 06:55.432
Oh, my God!

06:55.466 --> 06:59.236
Yeah!
Poopies! Poopies!

06:59.270 --> 07:00.971
That was really uncool.

07:01.005 --> 07:02.773
Do you feel the vibration?

07:03.574 --> 07:05.776
- Wow!
- Oh, shit!

07:05.809 --> 07:08.512
Hi, I'm Preston Lacy.
This is a human ramp.

07:11.081 --> 07:13.484
That's Dave Gravette.
Come on, we gotta go.

07:13.517 --> 07:14.652
Fuck, we gotta go.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.719
Someone's being
a little dramatic.

07:16.754 --> 07:19.523
Come on.
Oh, my God, we gotta go.

07:19.557 --> 07:21.025
Here he goes.

07:21.058 --> 07:22.126
He's coming!

07:22.159 --> 07:24.228
- Here, watch this.
- There he is.

07:24.261 --> 07:25.329
Brace yourselves.

07:26.330 --> 07:28.432
Oh, my goodness!

07:33.804 --> 07:36.040
Oh, God!
You all right?

07:36.073 --> 07:37.241
Yeah!

07:37.942 --> 07:38.976
Wow!

07:39.009 --> 07:41.045
You're not filming
my bald spot are you?

07:41.078 --> 07:41.979
No, no, no.

07:42.012 --> 07:44.114
You all right?

07:49.954 --> 07:52.323
God damn it,
is that why you put that camera...?

07:56.827 --> 07:58.762
No more bald spot!

07:59.630 --> 08:01.332
All right, here we go!

08:05.336 --> 08:06.370
Oh!

08:06.403 --> 08:07.671
Shit!

08:07.705 --> 08:09.406
Oh, my...
Oh, what happened?

08:09.440 --> 08:13.043
Oh, man, fuck this.
I gotta just get up and walk this off.

08:16.447 --> 08:18.249
Yeah!

08:20.284 --> 08:21.385
Oh!

08:23.053 --> 08:24.188
Backfire!

08:26.824 --> 08:29.393
You look like
the Kool-Aid man.

08:29.426 --> 08:33.664
It's time to introduce Zach Holmes
and say goodbye to the human ramp.

08:33.697 --> 08:35.065
Goodbye, human ramp!

08:35.666 --> 08:37.001
Oh, fuck!

08:37.934 --> 08:39.436
We're gonna fuckin' die!

08:39.470 --> 08:40.471
Two, one...

08:43.307 --> 08:44.441
Whoa!

08:44.475 --> 08:46.477
Oh!

08:46.510 --> 08:47.745
- All right!
- Oh, my God.

08:47.778 --> 08:48.846
Man falling.

08:48.879 --> 08:51.915
Holy shit! Yes! Fuck yes!

08:51.949 --> 08:54.251
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God, yes!

08:54.285 --> 08:55.319
I'm so glad I put this...

08:55.352 --> 08:57.721
Oh!

08:59.823 --> 09:01.125
That was awesome.

09:03.694 --> 09:05.195
I don't think Preston's okay.

09:05.729 --> 09:07.798
Motherfucker!

09:07.831 --> 09:09.900
Oh, dude, my back.
That hurt so bad.

09:09.933 --> 09:11.502
Oh, my God.

09:11.535 --> 09:12.803
Well done, Preston.

09:14.805 --> 09:17.608
All right,
my name's Johnny Knoxville.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.043
Welcome to the dum dum game.

09:19.076 --> 09:20.978
Oh! I'm... I'm sorry, dude.

09:21.011 --> 09:22.680
Are you fucking kidding me?

09:22.713 --> 09:23.814
I...

09:23.847 --> 09:26.150
My hand
hit the button!

09:26.183 --> 09:28.252
Oh, my God!

09:28.285 --> 09:29.553
Oh!

09:29.586 --> 09:31.021
Is that...

09:31.055 --> 09:32.056
Fuck!

09:32.623 --> 09:33.857
God!

09:33.891 --> 09:35.259
Dick pain hurts.

09:36.060 --> 09:38.495
All right,
let's play this game.

09:38.529 --> 09:43.200
Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville,
welcome to the dum dum game.

09:43.233 --> 09:46.904
Our lucky contestants are going
to be answering trivia questions.

09:46.937 --> 09:49.173
All these questions are on
a fourth-grade level.

09:49.206 --> 09:52.009
If you get them right,
you're safe and in the clear,

09:52.042 --> 09:53.744
and if you get them wrong...

09:53.778 --> 09:55.479
Oh, boy!

09:55.512 --> 09:57.748
Last man standing
is the winner.

09:57.782 --> 10:00.984
Okay, first question.
Poopies.

10:01.018 --> 10:03.153
"Jenny has two plates
of 12 cookies.

10:03.187 --> 10:05.824
Frank has four plates
of six cookies.

10:05.856 --> 10:07.591
Who has more cookies?"

10:07.624 --> 10:08.692
Jen!

10:08.726 --> 10:10.728
Jesus Christ!

10:14.932 --> 10:16.633
I can't do math!

10:20.170 --> 10:23.941
I'll remember that on my next
question, Poopies.

10:23.974 --> 10:25.275
- I won't...
- Yeah, thanks, Johnny.

10:26.877 --> 10:28.312
Dude!

10:28.345 --> 10:29.781
Okay, Ehren!

10:29.814 --> 10:32.883
Please spell the word
"dumbbell".

10:33.350 --> 10:34.718
"Dumbbell".

10:34.753 --> 10:36.220
D-u-m-b...

10:40.524 --> 10:41.592
What is it?

10:42.761 --> 10:44.328
D-u-m...

10:45.529 --> 10:47.231
b-e-l-l?

10:50.601 --> 10:52.002
Oh, God!

10:54.705 --> 10:56.106
Sorry, that was wrong.

10:56.140 --> 10:58.542
Don't be a dumbbell!

10:58.575 --> 11:04.448
Poopies. Who played the piano on Elton
John's album <i>Madman Across the Water?</i>

11:07.718 --> 11:08.986
Um...

11:10.487 --> 11:11.488
What's his name?

11:11.856 --> 11:12.990
Elton.

11:13.023 --> 11:14.425
Elton John!

11:14.458 --> 11:16.795
Oh, that is correct!

11:16.828 --> 11:19.663
That is correct, Poopies.

11:19.696 --> 11:22.166
I didn't think
you were gonna get that one.

11:22.199 --> 11:23.967
At last,
see, you're doin' good!

11:24.001 --> 11:26.270
- Yes!
- Way to go!

11:26.303 --> 11:27.137
Fuck, yeah.

11:27.171 --> 11:28.505
Wee Man, question:

11:28.539 --> 11:32.276
"What family of instruments
does the piano belong to?"

11:34.278 --> 11:35.279
S...

11:38.582 --> 11:39.716
Strings.

11:39.751 --> 11:40.885
It's a percussion instrument!

11:40.919 --> 11:42.519
I was gonna say that!

11:45.389 --> 11:47.558
I'm sorry, Wee Man,
but you're out.

11:47.591 --> 11:51.295
- All right. Good for me.
- Some integrity on that.

11:51.328 --> 11:55.867
Poopies, if you get this next
question wrong Ehren, unfortunately, wins.

11:55.900 --> 12:00.137
"If a square is five inches
tall and five inches wide,

12:00.170 --> 12:02.272
what is the area?"

12:04.943 --> 12:08.445
Ten inches direct... around.

12:08.479 --> 12:10.681
I'm sorry, Poopies,
but that is wrong!

12:17.187 --> 12:21.759
Ehren, I'm sorry,
I hit the wrong button.

12:24.294 --> 12:26.430
But Poopies, that was wrong.

12:28.999 --> 12:31.468
Fuck this shit.
I'm outta here! Fuck it!

12:31.502 --> 12:35.439
- Ehren! Ehren is the winner!
- Ehren won!

12:35.472 --> 12:36.673
Yeah!

12:36.707 --> 12:38.342
Ehren is the winner!

12:57.094 --> 12:58.462
Oh, yes!

13:08.806 --> 13:10.541
Oh, my God.

13:10.574 --> 13:12.010
Yeah, that rang my bell!

13:12.042 --> 13:14.311
I took a huge shit
in there too.

13:14.344 --> 13:17.015
- Oh, my...
- Whoo!

13:17.047 --> 13:21.019
So today we're gonna bring the
cast into this room two at a time

13:21.051 --> 13:23.420
because they think I'm doing
a rattlesnake stunt.

13:23.453 --> 13:27.391
But that's just a ruse to get them
in here so we can lock the door,

13:27.424 --> 13:30.160
turn out the lights,
and make their life a living hell.

13:30.193 --> 13:32.797
This is silence of the lambs.

13:33.898 --> 13:37.267
Dave England,
Ehren McGhehey...

13:37.301 --> 13:40.404
- We have Jules here. Are you excited?
- Jules, the snake guy.

13:40.437 --> 13:42.040
- I'm out. See you guys.
- Come on, Ehren!

13:42.072 --> 13:44.274
You guys are just
peanut gallery for this.

13:44.308 --> 13:45.977
He's got a western
diamondback rattlesnake.

13:46.010 --> 13:47.377
He's going to release it
on the ground.

13:47.411 --> 13:49.881
Pontius is gonna take a cookie
and set in on its head.

13:49.914 --> 13:53.918
And then, I'm going to try and
take the cookie off its head.

13:53.952 --> 13:57.789
This western diamondback
rattlesnake is very, very venomous.

13:57.822 --> 14:01.224
He will bite you if you get too close
to him and he will kill you, or try to.

14:01.258 --> 14:03.293
- I'm not kidding.
- Well, let's look at it.

14:04.461 --> 14:07.799
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit!

14:08.833 --> 14:10.500
Oh, my God.

14:10.534 --> 14:11.903
Fuck this, man.

14:14.304 --> 14:15.672
Can you feel my heart?

14:16.808 --> 14:18.977
- Wow, dude!
- All right.

14:19.010 --> 14:20.812
It's going as fast
as that rattlesnake.

14:20.845 --> 14:22.947
- That's why I won't do this.
- I did your part.

14:22.981 --> 14:25.083
I'm really scared for Johnny
right now.

14:25.115 --> 14:27.150
All right. Let's put the snake
away and get these guys mic'd.

14:27.184 --> 14:28.285
It's time to do this.

14:28.318 --> 14:30.454
Big ass snake.

14:30.487 --> 14:31.923
Oh, I know.

14:31.956 --> 14:33.123
All right, switch the bucket.

14:33.156 --> 14:34.625
Let's get the snake
out of the room.

14:41.164 --> 14:42.599
Is there an "antidope" here?

14:42.633 --> 14:45.335
It's getting Knoxville
for me.

14:45.369 --> 14:48.072
That's what it's called,
anti-venom, not "antidope".

14:48.106 --> 14:50.207
What's "antidope" mean?
I don't even know.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.209
- Johnny Knoxville.
- They're coming in right now.

14:52.242 --> 14:53.276
All right. You guys ready?

14:53.310 --> 14:54.846
What's "antidope"?

14:54.879 --> 14:56.814
That's like...

14:56.848 --> 14:57.949
Oh, my fucking God!

14:57.982 --> 14:59.182
- No!
- No!

14:59.216 --> 15:02.754
- God damn!
- Oh, fuck you guys!

15:02.787 --> 15:05.222
How... why are we the only ones
in here now?

15:05.255 --> 15:06.758
I don't know, dude.

15:10.427 --> 15:12.329
- Doggone it!
- What?

15:12.362 --> 15:14.731
- Shit!
- Hello, my name is Johnny Knoxville.

15:14.766 --> 15:16.433
Welcome to hell!

15:16.466 --> 15:18.936
Oh, fuck. Fucking
rattlesnake in here.

15:18.970 --> 15:21.171
Ehren, what are you doing?
Don't use me as a human shield!

15:21.738 --> 15:23.107
So if we get bit we die.

15:23.141 --> 15:25.877
Are you serious?

15:25.910 --> 15:28.478
This is so fucked up!
I knew this was going to fucking happen.

15:28.512 --> 15:30.380
Why the fuck did we go down
to the basement?

15:30.882 --> 15:32.249
Come on!

15:34.919 --> 15:36.954
Knox, what the fuck? Come on.

15:40.357 --> 15:42.325
Come on!

15:42.359 --> 15:43.895
What the fuck!

15:43.928 --> 15:45.562
Dude, what the hell?

15:45.595 --> 15:47.664
- What the fuck! No, stop!
- I knew this was going to happen!

15:47.698 --> 15:50.968
Stop! Stop! Oh!
Fuck, you guys, dude!

15:53.104 --> 15:54.438
P, where are you?

15:56.306 --> 15:57.909
I'm gonna break
that fucking door down.

15:57.942 --> 15:58.943
Do it, Ehren.

16:00.544 --> 16:02.479
Did they just...

16:02.512 --> 16:05.449
Fuck this shit!
Ah, fuck you guys!

16:07.752 --> 16:09.954
Fuck it, get the fuck
outta here!

16:09.987 --> 16:12.824
All right, now go for the
bucket and cue the snake sound.

16:15.225 --> 16:16.626
Oh, shit!

16:17.461 --> 16:18.328
Ahh!

16:18.361 --> 16:20.098
- Oh, oh, shit.
- Oh, my God!

16:20.131 --> 16:22.232
It might...
Guys, stay on the couch.

16:22.265 --> 16:24.135
The fuckin' snake.
Stay still.

16:24.168 --> 16:27.004
- Oh, my fucking God.
- Hey, guys, honestly, be fuckin' chill.

16:27.038 --> 16:31.308
- Holy shit.
- This is not cool, seriously, get me the fuck out of here.

16:31.776 --> 16:33.878
Oh, fuck off!

16:33.911 --> 16:35.378
There's the snake, Dave.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.381
Where are you, Ehren?
Ehren? Ehren?

16:38.415 --> 16:40.417
What the fuck! Ehren!

16:40.450 --> 16:42.352
How am I supposed to
even help you, Dave?

16:42.385 --> 16:43.988
I just need to know
you're there.

16:45.522 --> 16:47.491
- Fuck this!
- Ehren!

16:47.524 --> 16:50.795
Oh, I got a weapon now, motherfuckers.
I got a weapon.

16:50.828 --> 16:52.897
- Don't hit me, Ehren. Ehren!
- No, I got a weapon!

16:52.930 --> 16:55.099
- Don't hit me!
- You fuckin'...

16:55.133 --> 16:57.068
Ehren, don't fuckin'
not answer me.

16:57.101 --> 16:58.401
They're knifin' me.

17:00.905 --> 17:03.440
Fuck, there's the door.
Dave over here!

17:03.473 --> 17:05.108
- Dave, this way!
- Yeah, right!

17:05.143 --> 17:06.476
- Dave, this way!
- Fuck that door.

17:06.510 --> 17:07.845
Fuck that. There's something
bad over there, probably!

17:07.878 --> 17:08.712
No, I promise!

17:08.744 --> 17:10.547
No,
you don't know shit!

17:10.579 --> 17:12.916
There's a door.
I just opened it. I swear to God!

17:12.950 --> 17:15.352
Oh, wow, how convenient.

17:15.385 --> 17:17.621
Come this way, I swear to God,
I'm not lying to you.

17:17.654 --> 17:19.689
- Fuck that door.
- You're on your own then, fucker!

17:19.723 --> 17:21.992
Ahh, shit! Ahh!

17:25.896 --> 17:26.964
Ehren!

17:27.865 --> 17:31.701
What the fuck is going on?

17:31.735 --> 17:34.571
I can't even...
I can't even fucking do it.

17:34.604 --> 17:37.440
This is fucking scary.
Seriously, this is fucked up.

17:38.276 --> 17:40.011
This is not cool, dude.

17:41.979 --> 17:43.513
Fuck! What the fuck! His head!

17:43.547 --> 17:45.883
- Oh, my God! Fuck! Oh, fuck.
- What?

17:45.917 --> 17:47.752
- Did I just get bit?
- Did you get bit?

17:47.785 --> 17:49.887
Dude, I got bit by something!
What the fuck was that?

17:49.921 --> 17:52.857
- Fuck! Jeff! He got fuckin' bit!
- No way!

17:52.890 --> 17:56.260
- Jeff, this is fuckin' unsafe.
- What the fuck, there's no lights!

17:56.294 --> 17:57.829
Oh, my God, dude,
this is so fucked up.

17:57.862 --> 17:59.964
You got snake bit.
We got to get you medical attention.

17:59.997 --> 18:01.265
Here. come here.

18:01.299 --> 18:02.867
We got to get him
to the fucking medic.

18:02.900 --> 18:04.802
I'm gonna have a
fuckin' heart attack, dude.

18:04.836 --> 18:07.872
Just, okay?
Just go straight.

18:07.905 --> 18:09.240
- Okay?
- Okay.

18:09.273 --> 18:12.375
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

18:12.409 --> 18:14.078
Motherfucker!

18:14.111 --> 18:16.948
Oh, I don't even know where my glasses are.
What the fuck!

18:18.381 --> 18:20.517
Oh, great! Fucking awesome!

18:24.322 --> 18:25.689
What the fuck is this?

18:26.623 --> 18:27.959
Ah!

18:28.759 --> 18:30.928
Oh, holy shit!

18:31.829 --> 18:33.164
Motherfuckin...

18:36.399 --> 18:39.402
- Oh, my God!
- Ow! Fucking bitch!

18:42.173 --> 18:44.175
Lights on. Lights on.
Come on.

18:44.208 --> 18:45.675
Zach, you all right?

18:45.709 --> 18:47.178
- Holy shit...
- I cleared the fucking thing!

18:47.211 --> 18:49.847
I heard Zach, it sounded like
he's getting murdered in here.

18:51.015 --> 18:53.117
I thought this was like
the only way to get out.

18:53.150 --> 18:54.551
So I just climbed over it.

18:54.584 --> 18:55.920
And then, it broke.

18:57.221 --> 18:58.289
Let Ehren out.

18:58.322 --> 18:59.522
Let me out.

19:06.898 --> 19:09.267
- Can we go outside now?
- No, we're done, we're done. We're done.

19:09.300 --> 19:11.434
- No, we're not.
- God.

19:11.468 --> 19:13.737
The rest of my life I'm gonna
have nightmares, dude.

19:13.771 --> 19:16.307
I wanna go now.
Open that fuckin' door.

19:16.340 --> 19:17.875
Go out that one.
This one is locked.

19:17.909 --> 19:18.976
No, fuck you!

19:20.111 --> 19:22.380
I'll start a new life in here.

19:22.412 --> 19:24.048
I will start...

19:24.081 --> 19:25.816
I will fuckin' live here.

19:30.520 --> 19:31.721
How does this look?

19:32.455 --> 19:34.524
It's fuckin'... lubed up.

19:34.557 --> 19:36.093
Are we sponsored by Glide?

19:36.127 --> 19:37.494
No. Not yet.

19:37.527 --> 19:38.930
Just say, "This is body
surfing", we don't need an intro.

19:38.963 --> 19:40.530
- Do you guys agree?
- I wanna say my name.

19:40.563 --> 19:41.999
- All right, say your name.
- This is Zach.

19:42.033 --> 19:44.501
I'm Jasper. And this is
bodysurfing, motherfucker.

19:46.904 --> 19:47.905
Fuck, fuck!

19:47.939 --> 19:50.808
No, no, no!
No, Jasper, no, no!

19:50.841 --> 19:53.677
No! No!

19:53.710 --> 19:56.680
- Bye-bye, Jasper!
- Oh, shit, he's hauling ass!

20:00.284 --> 20:02.787
- That was great.
- The rocks hurt.

20:02.820 --> 20:05.990
I am Poopies.
Big time movie star.

20:07.557 --> 20:10.194
And today,
we're big wave surfing.

20:15.967 --> 20:19.003
Oh, he got knocked off.

20:20.137 --> 20:21.339
He has no arms.

20:21.372 --> 20:23.140
- Dude, you have no arms?
- Shit.

20:23.174 --> 20:24.342
Oh, that sucks.

20:24.375 --> 20:26.143
And then came the
heartbreaking news

20:26.177 --> 20:28.312
that horses don't have arms.

20:30.982 --> 20:33.483
I am Eric Manaka,
and this is a horse race.

20:37.021 --> 20:38.923
- Put your hat on and go, man.
- My eyes!

20:40.191 --> 20:41.624
Oh, God.

20:42.393 --> 20:44.261
Run, run.

20:44.295 --> 20:45.963
Oh, Jesus Christ.

20:48.631 --> 20:50.234
- This is perfect.
- Oh, God.

20:50.267 --> 20:51.802
Oh! Eric, all back.

20:53.670 --> 20:54.872
Is he okay?
He's not moving.

20:54.905 --> 20:56.974
Well, he can't.
His arms are trapped.

20:59.243 --> 21:00.277
That fucking hurt.

21:01.345 --> 21:03.848
Two, one, go!

21:03.881 --> 21:05.349
We're going the wrong way.

21:05.383 --> 21:06.417
We're going the wrong...

21:06.450 --> 21:08.052
Oh, Jesus Christ.

21:08.853 --> 21:09.854
Oh, shit.

21:10.221 --> 21:12.655
Oh, my God.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.058
Oh, he's nuts!

21:15.259 --> 21:16.726
Oh!

21:16.761 --> 21:18.229
Oh, my God.

21:20.364 --> 21:22.133
- Holy shit!
- Dude!

21:22.166 --> 21:23.167
That's crazy.

21:28.839 --> 21:31.574
Oh, my God.
I'm not doing that again.

21:31.608 --> 21:33.944
This guy's one
badass dude right here.

21:33.978 --> 21:35.346
I love you, dude.

21:35.379 --> 21:37.448
That is sick.

21:37.481 --> 21:39.250
You showed us how to surf.

21:40.985 --> 21:41.852
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:41.886 --> 21:43.586
Dude, I don't look
that good, man.

21:45.456 --> 21:48.225
Oh, shit.

21:48.259 --> 21:50.094
All right,
take off the lid.

21:50.127 --> 21:52.496
Tap that right
over the top of it.

21:52.530 --> 21:55.966
Ooh!
Ow! One got me already!

21:56.000 --> 21:58.035
Ah, ah!

21:58.069 --> 22:01.038
Ow! Gosh damn!

22:01.072 --> 22:03.007
Oh.
Here comes the queen.

22:03.040 --> 22:06.510
Oh, yeah.
Looking for her king.

22:06.544 --> 22:09.646
Jesus Christ, dude.
This is fucking wild.

22:09.679 --> 22:11.549
I was like, "Yeah, cool,
let's do this."

22:13.751 --> 22:17.455
This little brown box
has the Queen Bee in it.

22:17.488 --> 22:20.458
Apparently,
she's pretty important.

22:20.491 --> 22:23.761
And that's going to attract the
other bees to the Queen, right?

22:23.794 --> 22:25.763
- Yes.
- Oh, boy.

22:25.796 --> 22:28.466
There's a lot of
bees, Steve-O.

22:28.499 --> 22:32.269
Just remember, don't pinch between
his balls and those bees, 'cause...

22:32.303 --> 22:33.904
he'll feel it real quickly.

22:33.938 --> 22:36.774
Dude, relax. Poopies relax, dog.
Relax, man.

22:36.807 --> 22:38.641
Poopies just got stung.

22:39.676 --> 22:41.744
Can we add all the bees
or is it better to go...

22:41.779 --> 22:43.848
You gotta kinda gently
put 'em up.

22:44.714 --> 22:45.983
Watch out. Move your
hands, Steve-O.

22:47.184 --> 22:48.219
Oh, shit.

22:48.252 --> 22:51.122
Ah. Aaaah! Ooooh!

22:51.155 --> 22:52.189
What? What?

22:52.223 --> 22:55.658
God, my fucking dick got one.
Oooooh!

22:55.960 --> 22:57.761
Oooooh!

22:57.795 --> 23:01.165
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

23:01.198 --> 23:03.267
Put 'em right up there
on top of it.

23:06.137 --> 23:08.572
They're really
latching on now, Steve-O.

23:08.606 --> 23:09.940
It's working,
it's working.

23:09.974 --> 23:11.842
It's going good,
Steve-O.

23:13.511 --> 23:15.312
Oh, boy, that...
they're really...

23:15.346 --> 23:16.713
Oh, goddamn it.

23:18.616 --> 23:20.117
Give them a little bridge.

23:21.585 --> 23:23.154
There you go,
find your mommy.

23:23.187 --> 23:25.523
There's a lot of them right
in like the taint area.

23:28.893 --> 23:30.761
Your whole Zen
approach to staying calm

23:30.794 --> 23:32.429
is really working, Steve-O.

23:32.463 --> 23:34.298
That yoga's
really been helping.

23:35.132 --> 23:36.133
Meditating.

23:36.967 --> 23:39.236
- Ooh!
- Around the table.

23:39.270 --> 23:41.138
It's gonna make you
look good, Steve-O.

23:41.172 --> 23:42.806
Yeah,
it's adding length.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.476
It's kinda like
Mr. Snuffleupagus. Okay.

23:45.509 --> 23:48.312
Ow! Ow!

23:48.345 --> 23:50.713
Oooh. Oooh.

23:50.747 --> 23:53.784
- Are you good, O?
- Ahhh!

23:54.985 --> 23:56.921
It moves when you move.

23:58.556 --> 24:00.624
It's wiggling.
It's wiggling.

24:00.658 --> 24:03.360
- Wiggle!
- The best thing to do is take off running, Steve-O.

24:03.394 --> 24:05.196
- Lay down, Steve-O.
- Just take off running.

24:05.229 --> 24:09.400
Run, Steve-O. That's the only
way the bees won't sting you.

24:14.171 --> 24:17.408
I got a fucking ballsack
full of bee stingers, dude.

24:19.109 --> 24:20.945
Yeah, I got a fucking
bunch of them.

24:20.978 --> 24:22.880
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh.

24:28.619 --> 24:30.720
Hello, my name
is Irving Zisman,

24:30.754 --> 24:32.722
and this is my
good-for-nothing granddaughter

24:32.756 --> 24:36.026
and our not-so-handy
handyman, Zach.

24:36.060 --> 24:38.495
Today we're gonna do a little
furniture shopping.

24:44.802 --> 24:47.404
Hey, do you guys think this
looks straight, or is it sorta,

24:47.438 --> 24:49.039
- it's like if it was...
- I think you would have to...

24:49.073 --> 24:51.675
if you would hang the top
left side,

24:51.709 --> 24:52.943
I could tell if it's straight
or not 'cause...

24:52.977 --> 24:54.345
Oh, okay,
for sure.

24:54.378 --> 24:55.813
Is everything on sale?

24:55.846 --> 24:58.515
Right now, I'm just doing the pillows.
They're half price, but...

24:58.549 --> 25:01.352
- Oh, okay, thank you.
- But I'm sure everything might be on sale.

25:01.385 --> 25:02.453
Okay.

25:05.522 --> 25:07.191
What is this over here?

25:10.561 --> 25:13.964
Oh. This is pretty good.

25:13.998 --> 25:17.101
A fella could have a pretty
good time on this.

25:17.134 --> 25:19.570
Hey, can you hand me
the black tape over there?

25:24.008 --> 25:25.509
Oh, my God.

25:27.478 --> 25:28.879
Oh, my God.

25:28.912 --> 25:30.514
What the hell happened?

25:30.547 --> 25:34.852
- Ow!
- Are you okay?

25:34.885 --> 25:37.354
I went up high
as a moose's caboose.

25:38.222 --> 25:39.923
Oh, my God.

25:39.957 --> 25:41.659
- Oh, my God.
- Did you do that?

25:41.692 --> 25:45.362
I am so sorry. It's literally my
second day on the job. I fell off.

25:45.396 --> 25:48.565
You tried to take
advantage of a defenseless old man?

25:49.300 --> 25:51.001
Grandpa, are you okay?

25:51.035 --> 25:52.569
I was attacked.

25:52.603 --> 25:55.873
He went higher than that roof.
He went all the way up in there.

25:55.906 --> 25:57.975
- What?
- See this thing right here.

25:58.008 --> 26:03.080
Your grandfather just sat on it and
laid back. This guy, he fell down,

26:03.113 --> 26:05.416
and he knocked your
grandfather through the roof.

26:05.449 --> 26:08.018
Jesus,
he does this shit all the time.

26:10.321 --> 26:13.490
I am Rob Dyrdek, and this
is musical chair bags.

26:13.524 --> 26:17.928
Incredible fine young men,
new talent, war dogs.

26:17.961 --> 26:23.233
War dogs, new talent. One of them
is about to get blown sky high.

26:23.267 --> 26:26.103
The rest are gonna get really
lucky and just sit comfortably.

26:26.136 --> 26:29.373
Our DJ for the day is
Miss Rachel Wolfson.

26:29.406 --> 26:32.643
Wee Man's going to space.

26:32.676 --> 26:34.044
- Ah, shit.
- Wow.

26:34.078 --> 26:36.013
Man, Wee Man. I am sorry, man.

26:36.046 --> 26:37.981
How many times
do we get to play?

26:39.083 --> 26:41.485
- Oh, this is probably a one'r.
- Oh, it is.

26:41.518 --> 26:43.822
Shit.

26:49.093 --> 26:51.061
I am loving
the energy, fellas.

26:51.095 --> 26:54.565
- Keep it up, nice twirl.
- The happiness.

26:56.567 --> 26:57.568
Oh, shit. Get in it.

27:01.872 --> 27:03.808
And let's keep going.

27:12.751 --> 27:14.418
Oh, find your chairs!

27:16.620 --> 27:18.956
One more time!

27:23.394 --> 27:25.396
What happened
to the dance?

27:25.429 --> 27:29.533
- Just do it already.
- Wee Man is not happy.

27:29.566 --> 27:31.068
He's not happy.

27:31.101 --> 27:33.772
- Wee Man, come on!
- Put some spirit in it.

27:33.805 --> 27:35.472
- I'm spiriting it.
- Yeah.

27:35.506 --> 27:36.673
Fuck it.

27:36.707 --> 27:38.275
Oh!

27:42.045 --> 27:43.380
Oh, my God.

27:44.748 --> 27:46.216
Holy fuck.

27:46.885 --> 27:48.753
Oh, God.

27:48.787 --> 27:51.321
- Oh, man.
- What happened to you?

27:51.355 --> 27:55.459
I believe he shot up
and into the hole.

27:55.492 --> 28:01.231
<i>Wee Man flipped.
How did you go backwards?</i>

28:01.265 --> 28:03.967
We have our champion.

28:04.001 --> 28:05.736
I landed on all that shit.

28:05.770 --> 28:08.505
Look at the safety
precautions.

28:08.539 --> 28:12.276
I thought we were supposed to have
pads on the tubes and the metal.

28:12.309 --> 28:13.677
We forgot that detail.

28:16.146 --> 28:18.649
Once upon a time,
lived a father and son

28:18.682 --> 28:20.584
imprisoned on the
island of Crete.

28:20.617 --> 28:23.720
Tired of life in the joint,
the father had the son gather up feathers

28:23.755 --> 28:26.156
that were lying around the cell
and he made them both wings.

28:26.190 --> 28:29.660
And they went off to escape
the island of Crete forever.

28:29.693 --> 28:33.497
But there's that one thing they
left out of the ancient myth.

28:33.898 --> 28:35.232
The cannon.

28:37.334 --> 28:41.505
Hello, I am Johnny Knoxville and
this is the flight of Icarus.

28:41.538 --> 28:44.308
And if you think we're wearing
underpants under these tunics,

28:44.341 --> 28:46.677
you're sadly mistaken,
my friend.

28:48.178 --> 28:50.247
Mmm, mmm.
A little something for ya?

28:52.483 --> 28:53.984
They should just point it
straight up.

28:54.017 --> 28:56.487
Either way it goes,
he's gonna land in this lake.

28:56.520 --> 29:00.190
How big of an angle is
it gonna be?

29:00.224 --> 29:02.927
Oh, God,
they're going to make it bad.

29:02.961 --> 29:06.096
- Oh, God, I can't take it!
- Shit, man.

29:06.129 --> 29:08.967
- Man, that's steep.
- Holy shit, Knox.

29:08.999 --> 29:13.604
In ten, nine, eight,

29:13.637 --> 29:17.608
seven, six, five, four,

29:17.641 --> 29:21.645
three, two, one. Whooo!

29:22.045 --> 29:24.448
Yes!

29:30.053 --> 29:34.291
- I felt like I got a 200-pound colonic up my ass.
- Oh, my God.

29:38.763 --> 29:41.665
You flew like an angel.

29:41.698 --> 29:44.468
<i>Unfortunately,
young Icarus got a little bit cocky,</i>

29:44.501 --> 29:46.871
<i>and sure enough flew
too close to the sun.</i>

29:46.905 --> 29:48.773
<i>And fell to his doom.</i>

29:56.848 --> 29:58.549
Ooooh!

30:04.288 --> 30:06.590
- That was rad, dude.
- There's blood on the elbows.

30:06.623 --> 30:07.892
Yeah, attaboy.

30:07.926 --> 30:10.394
Good job, man.
Fucking right on, dude.

30:10.427 --> 30:11.896
- Your legs okay?
- Yeah.

30:11.930 --> 30:13.730
Good job.

30:16.166 --> 30:17.734
This is the quiet game.

30:17.769 --> 30:23.041
The object of this game is to remain
completely silent. How was that?

30:23.073 --> 30:27.177
Do we all understand the rules and
we're not gonna make any noise?

30:28.478 --> 30:30.614
All right,
well, let's get started.

30:30.647 --> 30:34.919
Rachel, your challenge in the quiet
game is to lick the electric lollipop.

30:34.953 --> 30:36.486
Are you ready?

30:37.354 --> 30:39.289
Jesus.

30:46.764 --> 30:50.467
Whooooaaah!

30:51.168 --> 30:54.304
Our first mime
did really well.

30:54.338 --> 30:56.808
- Oh, yeah.
- Way to go.

30:57.708 --> 30:59.610
Yeah!

30:59.643 --> 31:02.579
- Bar's been set. You'll be hard to beat.
- Damn!

31:04.581 --> 31:07.417
For our next challenge,
our friend Jules here

31:07.451 --> 31:10.520
is going to help Poopies
kiss this deadly viper.

31:12.289 --> 31:13.390
What kind of snake is it?

31:13.423 --> 31:15.359
It's a Texas Rat Snake.

31:15.392 --> 31:18.362
He's a feisty little bugger.
How you feeling, Poopies?

31:21.164 --> 31:22.733
Is that venomous?

31:22.767 --> 31:25.702
Eh.

31:27.170 --> 31:28.438
We ready?

31:30.607 --> 31:32.175
- Go, go, go.
- Go in for the kiss.

31:32.209 --> 31:33.243
You have to get in
closer.

31:33.276 --> 31:34.645
- Closer.
- Closer, closer.

31:34.678 --> 31:37.581
Up and down,
up and down. Up and down.

31:37.614 --> 31:39.884
You know you don't...
You need to stay. Stay!

31:39.917 --> 31:41.251
Give him a kiss.

31:41.284 --> 31:42.486
- Move your head.
- Closer.

31:42.519 --> 31:44.488
- Move your head.
- Closer.

31:44.521 --> 31:45.890
Here it comes,
here it comes.

31:45.923 --> 31:48.225
- Oh, my God.
- One more.

31:48.258 --> 31:49.526
Get another one,
get another one.

31:49.559 --> 31:51.461
- Go again.
- We didn't get it.

31:51.495 --> 31:53.163
Come on, Poopies,
you need to go again, dude.

31:53.196 --> 31:55.332
Oh, my God.

31:55.365 --> 31:58.002
- Work, work. You got this.
- You can do it.

31:58.036 --> 31:59.871
Right there.
Touch his tail.

31:59.904 --> 32:01.438
Do it, come on, man.

32:01.471 --> 32:04.708
- Come on, man.
- Oh, my goodness.

32:04.741 --> 32:05.843
A little kissy.

32:05.877 --> 32:06.978
Here it goes.

32:07.011 --> 32:09.646
Oh!

32:11.015 --> 32:13.051
Oh, my goodness.

32:13.084 --> 32:17.187
Rachel and Poopies laying
down the gauntlet on Steve-O.

32:18.056 --> 32:19.123
I gotta save you!

32:23.660 --> 32:24.996
I am saving you.

32:27.364 --> 32:29.000
I gotta save Jeff.

32:32.469 --> 32:35.940
Oh! Ow!

32:35.973 --> 32:37.274
Oh, fuck.

32:38.176 --> 32:39.509
I have one on me.

32:39.543 --> 32:41.112
I couldn't get it out.

32:42.379 --> 32:45.515
So, confidence
is very, very high

32:45.549 --> 32:47.919
with our third contestant,
Steve-O,

32:47.952 --> 32:50.253
for the skateboard guillotine.

32:53.124 --> 32:54.992
Wow.

32:55.026 --> 32:56.259
He's talking smack.

32:56.293 --> 32:58.029
Some mime shit talking
over there.

33:01.732 --> 33:02.733
Huh?

33:03.201 --> 33:04.401
All the way.

33:06.804 --> 33:07.905
All the way?

33:13.577 --> 33:15.746
- He's bold.
- Wow.

33:15.780 --> 33:18.281
- He's very cocky, this guy.
- Get your feet up.

33:18.315 --> 33:20.952
All right, on three!

33:21.886 --> 33:23.154
Aaaaah!

33:27.591 --> 33:30.762
<i>I forgot to
be fucking quiet, dude.</i>

33:30.795 --> 33:32.562
Aaaaah!

33:32.596 --> 33:36.600
Well, we have our winners,
and we have Steve-O.

33:42.739 --> 33:45.877
Zackass,
he's a real wild, crazy guy.

33:45.910 --> 33:48.445
He's a gnarly superstar.

33:48.478 --> 33:50.580
Zackass.

33:50.614 --> 33:54.252
There's nothing
he won't do. Zackass.

33:54.284 --> 33:56.386
He'll jump in cactus for you.

33:56.419 --> 33:59.422
Oh!

34:01.358 --> 34:04.862
While we all
stand and laugh. Go, go, Zach!

34:06.596 --> 34:08.665
The Jackass guys are
getting old, we paid our dues,

34:08.697 --> 34:10.734
so we're handing the torch
to you.

34:12.904 --> 34:14.071
All right.

34:16.373 --> 34:17.574
Man, that was good.

34:22.512 --> 34:24.081
What are you going to be
doing today?

34:24.949 --> 34:27.885
Hit somebody in the nuts.

34:27.918 --> 34:32.621
Francis hits harder than any
heavyweight in the MMA. It's insane.

34:32.656 --> 34:33.991
Does Ehren know this?

34:34.025 --> 34:36.960
No, I told Ehren it was
a lightweight.

34:36.994 --> 34:40.397
I didn't tell him it was a heavyweight.
Jeff and I forgot to mention that.

34:42.833 --> 34:44.534
All right,
he's coming, guys.

34:47.370 --> 34:52.176
That's not a fucking lightweight.
What are you guys talking about? What? No!

34:52.210 --> 34:56.013
What's going on here?
You guys can't...

34:56.047 --> 35:00.383
Almost 20 years ago today we
filmed the original cup test.

35:00.417 --> 35:03.453
Hi, I am Johnny Knoxville,
and this is the cup test.

35:03.486 --> 35:05.056
Oh!

35:05.089 --> 35:06.690
Oh!

35:06.723 --> 35:08.292
Oh!

35:08.326 --> 35:13.463
And now, 20 years later,
we're still doing the same stupid shit.

35:13.496 --> 35:15.498
This is the cup test.

35:16.968 --> 35:18.735
Ah!

35:18.769 --> 35:20.670
I love how you're just
smiling at him.

35:24.474 --> 35:27.778
I just Googled the hardest
punch ever recorded.

35:27.812 --> 35:29.379
<i>Francis
Ngannou's punch is</i>

35:29.412 --> 35:33.818
<i>the equivalent of being hit
by a Ford Escort at top speed.</i>

35:33.851 --> 35:38.022
- His punch is the equivalent...
- Wait. You don't need to read that now.

35:41.125 --> 35:43.895
You're about to
be hit by a car, Ehren.

35:45.129 --> 35:46.396
All right, fight fans.

35:50.067 --> 35:51.701
Oh!

35:56.573 --> 36:04.115
- Did you hear something break?
- Yeah, I heard this crack. I thought it was the cup.

36:04.148 --> 36:06.650
<i>Is that the hardest you've
ever hit someone in the ding ding?</i>

36:06.683 --> 36:12.522
<i>Oh, yeah. Because I've never
hit somebody in the ding ding on purpose.</i>

36:13.723 --> 36:15.293
Eric, what's about to
go down here?

36:15.326 --> 36:19.797
Ehren's gonna get the world's
fastest softball pitcher.

36:19.830 --> 36:22.133
She's gonna like,
pitch a softball at his balls.

36:22.800 --> 36:26.304
Oh!

36:26.337 --> 36:29.739
We ain't a fucking bunch of NASA
scientists over here, you know what I mean?

36:29.774 --> 36:32.676
This ain't a Mensa convention.
We're getting down and dirty!

36:32.709 --> 36:35.745
I am Danger Ehren,
and this is the softball test.

36:35.780 --> 36:36.914
Let's do it.

36:36.948 --> 36:38.149
Play ball!

36:40.351 --> 36:42.552
She can't wait to hit him
in the dick.

36:46.324 --> 36:48.159
Oh!

36:48.192 --> 36:49.726
That was all thigh.

36:50.727 --> 36:52.863
Don't turn!
That would have hit him!

36:52.897 --> 36:54.231
You turned into...

36:54.265 --> 36:56.334
What, you can't quit
already!

36:56.367 --> 36:57.734
That would have
hit him!

36:57.768 --> 36:59.036
That would have hit you
in the ding-ding

36:59.070 --> 37:00.905
and you would have been done
for the day.

37:00.938 --> 37:01.973
It's a softball.

37:02.006 --> 37:04.241
There's nothing soft
about this fucking ball,

37:04.275 --> 37:05.475
it's just bigger.

37:11.248 --> 37:14.285
She keeps hitting him
in the same exact spot.

37:14.318 --> 37:16.988
- You're moving, dude!
- Why'd you move?

37:17.021 --> 37:18.122
I don't know!

37:20.958 --> 37:22.226
Don't hang brains out
of the side...

37:22.259 --> 37:25.562
I'm not trying to,
but it keeps slipping around.

37:25.595 --> 37:27.765
Well, you're wearing it
backwards, or upside-down.

37:27.798 --> 37:30.301
I don't need physics
from you guys right now.

37:30.334 --> 37:32.635
Physics.

37:37.274 --> 37:38.776
Fuck, yeah! Let's go!

37:39.509 --> 37:40.845
Oh, God!

37:45.349 --> 37:46.549
Ehren!

37:46.583 --> 37:48.285
What the fuck, dude!

37:49.286 --> 37:50.720
No, no, no, time out!

37:50.755 --> 37:54.025
Hey, Ehren, no joke,
you're fucked.

37:54.058 --> 37:55.059
You're done.

37:56.927 --> 37:59.696
I'm here with professional
hockey player P.K. Subban.

37:59.729 --> 38:01.932
This is the hockey cup test.

38:03.100 --> 38:05.836
Yeah!

38:06.937 --> 38:08.005
Come on!

38:23.586 --> 38:25.356
<i>That was about
85 miles per hour.</i>

38:25.389 --> 38:27.958
<i>Oh, shit, man.
That fucking knocked me out.</i>

38:28.793 --> 38:31.694
What the fuck, man.
That was insane.

38:31.728 --> 38:33.464
Now I'm gonna go
for your nuts.

38:33.497 --> 38:34.697
Oh, God.

38:36.233 --> 38:37.768
Fuck you, Ehren!

38:50.448 --> 38:51.748
We got him!

38:52.249 --> 38:53.583
That a boy!

38:57.188 --> 39:01.125
We got the "whambulance" coming for
you if you don't get to this next bit.

39:01.158 --> 39:04.295
Hey, I'll tell you right now,
if the jokes continue

39:04.328 --> 39:05.896
I will stand up
and walk away.

39:05.930 --> 39:08.099
He's going to
take his nuts and go home?

39:13.270 --> 39:16.240
- Sneak up on it.
- Teasing. He's teasing.

39:18.375 --> 39:19.609
Whoa!

39:22.179 --> 39:23.447
Perfect!

39:23.481 --> 39:25.249
- Oh!
- Oh, my goodness.

39:29.652 --> 39:30.921
Oh, dude!

39:31.755 --> 39:34.825
His nuts are bleeding.
We got blood.

39:34.859 --> 39:37.161
Dude. I'm sorry, dude.

39:37.194 --> 39:39.396
Fuck, this cup sucked.

39:40.931 --> 39:43.901
This is the worst
cup of them all.

39:43.934 --> 39:46.303
I'm starting to think
those cups don't work, dude.

39:48.205 --> 39:50.107
<i>That cup sucks.</i>

39:50.141 --> 39:52.610
<i>Yeah, it slipped down and
pinned your nuts to the ground.</i>

39:52.642 --> 39:54.879
Oh, my God!

39:55.745 --> 39:57.314
Fuck, dude.

39:58.115 --> 40:00.084
Oh. Ooh!

40:00.117 --> 40:02.453
Lance?

40:02.486 --> 40:03.720
How you doing, Lance?

40:06.790 --> 40:08.325
Let me have your
camera, Lance.

40:12.296 --> 40:14.465
Can I get another mask?

40:14.498 --> 40:16.367
Can Lance
get another mask?

40:19.036 --> 40:22.206
You guys got any predictions who
we might get today with this?

40:22.239 --> 40:24.775
I'm worried, like we've
been hitting the guys

40:24.808 --> 40:26.443
pretty hard all week so...

40:27.912 --> 40:30.414
their nerves are
pretty well shot.

40:30.447 --> 40:33.683
If they do trust us
to go to the bathroom today,

40:33.716 --> 40:34.919
they're pretty...

40:36.287 --> 40:39.990
They're pretty less
intelligent than I thought.

40:40.024 --> 40:41.926
We're gonna build
Cobra Kai Dojos

40:41.959 --> 40:43.761
- all over this valley.
- Hell yeah, we are.

40:43.794 --> 40:46.363
- I haven't seen it yet. I haven't seen...
- I'm gonna watch it.

40:46.397 --> 40:47.631
Miyagi, Miyagi's Dojo...

40:47.665 --> 40:49.633
Wee Man would totally
be a Cobra Kai.

40:49.667 --> 40:52.236
He's not even
worried about it.

40:52.269 --> 40:53.771
Cobra Kai rules.

40:58.375 --> 41:00.578
Oh, yeah!

41:08.185 --> 41:09.887
- Oh.
- Wow!

41:09.920 --> 41:12.923
- What happened?
- I don't know, dude.

41:12.957 --> 41:15.593
- Oh, my God.
- I was trying to take a shit.

41:17.294 --> 41:20.197
Even with an outbreak you're
still blowing people up.

41:21.432 --> 41:23.133
As if life
is not hard enough.

41:27.004 --> 41:29.907
To fart or not to fart.
That is the question.

41:29.940 --> 41:32.276
Well, I hope to...

41:32.309 --> 41:35.913
'cause we've been trying
to get this bit for 14 years,

41:35.946 --> 41:37.948
trying to light
a fart underwater.

41:38.616 --> 41:40.651
Since <i>Jackass Number Two.</i>

41:40.684 --> 41:42.486
Get your fucking
ass up there.

41:42.519 --> 41:44.021
Just let me do it, okay?

41:51.595 --> 41:54.131
Oh, God.
I didn't mean to do that.

41:54.164 --> 41:56.267
Who didn't see
that coming?

41:56.300 --> 41:59.403
I'm very excited
because we are lighting

41:59.436 --> 42:01.972
the first ever
fart underwater.

42:02.006 --> 42:04.108
And Tory Belleci
is here today

42:04.141 --> 42:05.843
to help us achieve our dream.

42:05.876 --> 42:07.845
It's good to have dreams.

42:07.878 --> 42:10.447
All right, so, somebody
is going to sit in the tank

42:10.481 --> 42:11.882
and when they fart,

42:11.915 --> 42:14.885
that glass dome is our
fart catcher, inside there,

42:14.918 --> 42:17.888
we have a little
bit of oxygen and a spark.

42:17.921 --> 42:19.690
And so hopefully,
once that methane gas

42:19.723 --> 42:21.825
gets caught in there,
it will ignite,

42:21.859 --> 42:25.396
and we'll get the underwater
exploding fart.

42:25.429 --> 42:27.364
- Yo, Steve-O, are you ready?
- You ready to make history?

42:27.398 --> 42:29.333
I'm ready to get in there
and just see what happens.

42:29.366 --> 42:31.702
Oh, my goodness,
we're about to make history

42:31.735 --> 42:32.870
with Steve-O.

42:32.903 --> 42:36.507
Okay, make sure
his feet look good.

42:36.540 --> 42:38.275
- Ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

42:38.309 --> 42:40.744
- It's in there, man.
- Remember to give us a countdown.

42:40.779 --> 42:41.979
It's in there.

42:42.713 --> 42:44.515
How was work today, honey?

42:50.187 --> 42:51.588
I know
I'm gonna get it.

42:51.622 --> 42:52.656
Just relax.

42:52.690 --> 42:54.759
Ooooh!

42:54.793 --> 42:56.226
We got a fart!

42:57.928 --> 43:01.098
Oh, that was a huge one.

43:01.131 --> 43:03.200
- Wow. They're like ten, dude.
- They're perfect bombs.

43:03.233 --> 43:05.936
There's not enough
methane in his fart.

43:05.969 --> 43:08.105
<i>The spark in that bowl
is going nonstop though,</i>

43:08.138 --> 43:10.240
<i>so we just need to catch
enough farts.</i>

43:11.308 --> 43:12.811
Oooh!

43:12.843 --> 43:14.211
The farts
aren't igniting.

43:14.244 --> 43:16.880
- We need an open flame.
- Yeah, bring it in.

43:21.719 --> 43:23.187
This won't hurt a bit.

43:31.261 --> 43:32.329
Come on, O.

43:35.733 --> 43:36.801
There it goes. Catch it.

43:36.835 --> 43:38.535
Yeah. Get it. Get it!

43:45.743 --> 43:48.645
What was that?
Was that it? Was that it?

43:49.246 --> 43:50.147
- Yes!
- Dude!

43:50.180 --> 43:52.049
I'm not a fucking
scientist, man,

43:52.082 --> 43:54.084
but that sounded pretty sweet.

43:55.953 --> 43:57.187
How did that explode?

43:57.221 --> 43:59.423
The spark in the fart
catcher exploded it.

44:01.458 --> 44:04.595
<i>That fucking really
rocked my balls. That's for sure.</i>

44:08.499 --> 44:09.900
All right, Jaws, you ready?

44:10.501 --> 44:11.502
Three.

44:12.503 --> 44:13.570
Two.

44:15.105 --> 44:16.340
One.

44:21.712 --> 44:23.414
- Jesus Christ!
- I got you.

44:23.447 --> 44:25.215
What the fuck!

44:25.249 --> 44:26.785
Dude, I was like,
"Catch him."

44:29.119 --> 44:30.587
- Wow.
- Are you okay?

44:30.621 --> 44:31.756
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

44:31.790 --> 44:33.724
Dude... Where were you?

44:33.758 --> 44:35.092
I'm just... I...

44:35.125 --> 44:36.927
Where were you?

44:39.329 --> 44:40.697
What's going on, Jasper?

44:40.731 --> 44:43.367
So today we got my dad,
Dark Shark on set and honestly

44:43.400 --> 44:45.569
- I don't think he's gonna like it.
- Why not?

44:45.602 --> 44:48.472
So you know my dad,
ex-convict, ex-gang banger,

44:48.505 --> 44:50.507
doesn't fear anything
except for like,

44:50.541 --> 44:53.143
he kinda doesn't
like bugs or spiders,

44:53.177 --> 44:55.746
cats, dogs, basically anything
that's not normal to the hood.

44:55.780 --> 44:57.181
So we're gonna fuck
with him today

44:57.214 --> 44:59.216
and it should be good.

44:59.249 --> 45:03.654
All right, this is Dark Shark,
our newest star, Jasper's dad.

45:03.687 --> 45:06.957
He's going to battle Ehren
in the spider helmet.

45:06.990 --> 45:10.093
You look scareder than me
and this is your shit.

45:10.127 --> 45:11.728
Shall we begin taping, fellas?

45:11.763 --> 45:14.131
I'm gonna fuck you up, man.
You supposed to be having my back.

45:14.164 --> 45:16.400
- Not too tight.
- I got you a job!

45:16.433 --> 45:18.702
Don't do it. I'm telling you.
I'm gonna flip this chair over.

45:18.735 --> 45:20.070
I got you a job!

45:20.103 --> 45:21.672
If I flip the chair over,
that thing gonna bite me

45:21.705 --> 45:23.006
- if I flip the chair over?
- No.

45:23.040 --> 45:24.975
No, you gotta be careful
with the spider.

45:25.008 --> 45:27.010
- Can't hurt the spider.
- I'm just worried about breathing, man.

45:27.044 --> 45:28.847
I don't even like
handcuffs on me no more.

45:28.880 --> 45:30.047
Dude, I don't think
we gotta...

45:30.080 --> 45:31.748
Okay.
We're gonna leave the tape.

45:31.783 --> 45:32.951
You got it, dog.

45:32.983 --> 45:35.385
All right,
here we go, fellas.

45:36.687 --> 45:38.823
- How is that?
- Oh shit, hell, nah.

45:38.857 --> 45:41.225
Okay. Oh, and by the
way, the loser has to take

45:41.258 --> 45:43.060
- the bite from the spider.
- What?

45:43.093 --> 45:44.695
Yeah.

45:44.728 --> 45:47.531
- Jules, can you bring in the spider?
- Love to.

45:47.564 --> 45:49.801
You got it, Dark Shark.
You got it, man.

45:49.834 --> 45:52.102
This one is
an absolute bastard.

45:52.135 --> 45:53.704
Oh, hell, nah.

45:53.737 --> 45:56.173
All right. Let's go.

45:56.206 --> 45:58.575
On the count of three.
One, two, three.

46:05.817 --> 46:07.651
Don't move,
Dark Shark.

46:09.052 --> 46:10.822
Dark Shark, stay down.

46:14.591 --> 46:16.159
Oh, shit!

46:16.928 --> 46:18.462
Chill, chill, chill!

46:19.864 --> 46:22.399
You got it, chill!

46:24.601 --> 46:26.136
It's not goin' touch you.

46:28.639 --> 46:31.041
Ow! Ow!

46:36.346 --> 46:39.249
Dark Shark,
why are you pulling on me?

46:39.283 --> 46:40.417
I think he passed out.

46:40.450 --> 46:42.519
Dark Shark,
you gotta let go!

46:42.553 --> 46:46.089
- You gotta let go! Sit down. Calm down.
- There you go.

46:46.123 --> 46:48.392
- Oh, my God.
- Don't hurt the spider.

46:48.425 --> 46:50.962
Dark Shark, if you let go
of me I will get the spider out.

46:50.995 --> 46:53.130
- Who is that?
- It's Johnny.

46:53.163 --> 46:55.265
- There you go.
- We all day. Guess what?

46:55.299 --> 46:57.134
Okay, I'll get it.

46:57.167 --> 46:58.535
I'm gonna pull him out.

46:59.536 --> 47:02.172
- He's out, he's out, he's out.
- He's out!

47:02.874 --> 47:06.076
All right, we have our winner.

47:06.109 --> 47:08.245
Dark Shark!

47:08.278 --> 47:10.714
How the fuck
is he gonna be the winner?

47:10.747 --> 47:12.082
- Oh, no.
- Get it off me.

47:12.115 --> 47:13.483
How is he the winner?

47:13.517 --> 47:15.218
Ehren has to take
a bite from the spider.

47:15.252 --> 47:17.454
- I didn't do anything. Jesus.
- This man was brave.

47:17.487 --> 47:21.926
- Brave? The spider went in his helmet!
- Great job, Dark Shark.

47:25.596 --> 47:27.598
And I was like,
it was either my life or yours.

47:27.631 --> 47:30.334
I was like, fuck your life.
I was like, man.

47:30.367 --> 47:32.736
I'm tapped out, out here
and still I was like,

47:32.770 --> 47:34.237
I feel like grabbing his ass.

47:34.271 --> 47:35.873
The bastard.

47:35.907 --> 47:37.474
So where should
it bite him?

47:37.507 --> 47:39.576
Just do it on my arm.
It's fine.

47:39.610 --> 47:41.879
- Well...
- Have it crawl onto my arm.

47:41.913 --> 47:43.180
- Nipples!
- I just won't do it.

47:43.213 --> 47:45.716
Nipple. I like nipple.
Nipple.

47:45.749 --> 47:47.651
Just give it, just do a boob.

47:47.684 --> 47:48.886
All right. Fine.

47:50.320 --> 47:52.322
Nipple, no.
Boob, sure.

47:53.724 --> 47:55.659
Is he
gonna bite him for real?

47:55.692 --> 47:58.763
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, yeah, your man titties are looking dope.

47:58.796 --> 47:59.897
Oh, man.

47:59.931 --> 48:01.966
Oh, my God.
Look at his fangs.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.433
I don't wanna see the fangs.

48:03.467 --> 48:05.135
Make sure Ehren
sees the fangs.

48:05.168 --> 48:06.536
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait a minute!

48:06.570 --> 48:09.040
No, you, no.
Ehren lay down.

48:09.073 --> 48:11.042
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, look at the venom!

48:11.075 --> 48:13.011
- I'll show you the venom while it's there.
- Yeah.

48:13.044 --> 48:14.611
Oh, my God.

48:14.645 --> 48:16.513
Here, hold my hand,
Steve-O. Hold my hand.

48:16.546 --> 48:19.282
- Hold my hand, Steve-O.
- Hold his hand, Steve-O.

48:19.316 --> 48:22.686
- Pierce that nipple.
- One, two, three.

48:23.988 --> 48:25.656
Shit!

48:28.325 --> 48:30.895
- Oh, shit!
- Stay, stay.

48:30.928 --> 48:32.162
<i>Did it go in or no?</i>

48:32.195 --> 48:33.765
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>
- <i>Fuckin' went in.</i>

48:33.798 --> 48:36.366
<i>You went from a
triple A to a B on this side.</i>

48:36.400 --> 48:38.201
<i>Yeah, Ehren.</i>

48:39.269 --> 48:41.471
Watch out, Ehren!

48:41.505 --> 48:43.407
Oh, my God,
I thought it was the real thing.

48:43.440 --> 48:45.308
I'm done!
I'm done! I can't.

48:45.843 --> 48:46.978
I'm outta here.

48:47.011 --> 48:48.880
No more of this spider crap.
I'm out.

48:56.788 --> 48:58.255
Excuse me, ma'am?

48:58.288 --> 49:01.258
I need to get my basket
closer to this pole.

49:01.291 --> 49:02.726
Do you think
you can help me, ma'am?

49:02.760 --> 49:07.065
- Sure.
- There's a red handle at the back of this truck.

49:07.098 --> 49:08.900
It's more
of a pinky orange.

49:08.933 --> 49:11.936
- This one?
- Yeah, just pull back on it just a little.

49:11.969 --> 49:13.838
Wait, should I do reverse?

49:13.871 --> 49:16.074
Yeah, do the reverse.

49:16.107 --> 49:18.475
Yeah, no, no!
Oh, that was... Noooo!

49:18.508 --> 49:20.210
Oh, why did you hit
the red one?

49:20.243 --> 49:22.046
Ow! Ow!

49:22.080 --> 49:23.114
Help!

49:23.147 --> 49:24.849
- Help!
- Help me!

49:24.882 --> 49:26.349
Hit the lever!
Hit the lever!

49:26.383 --> 49:27.952
Hit the blue!
Hit the override!

49:27.985 --> 49:29.821
I don't know
where the blue is?

49:29.854 --> 49:31.122
Are you color blind?

49:31.155 --> 49:34.125
- Please, help me!
- I'm trying to help you, sir!

49:34.158 --> 49:36.226
Just do the override
like it says!

49:36.259 --> 49:38.162
It doesn't say shit here!

49:38.196 --> 49:40.798
Pop to the right, then slide!

49:40.832 --> 49:42.399
Pop and slide!

49:44.534 --> 49:46.737
You just got me electrocuted!

49:46.771 --> 49:49.040
Oh, my ass!

49:49.073 --> 49:51.675
- You forgot the slide.
- God, bless!

49:51.708 --> 49:53.878
I don't want to touch anything
because I don't know...

49:53.911 --> 49:56.580
You gotta touch something!
I gotta get down from here!

49:56.613 --> 49:59.349
- Which one?
- Well, don't hit the ones you been hitting!

49:59.382 --> 50:01.618
'Cause you've been
hitting the wrong ones!

50:01.651 --> 50:04.654
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- Well, clearly!

50:06.289 --> 50:08.793
Did you see <i>Dirty Dancing?</i>

50:08.826 --> 50:11.495
No. The old one,
you mean with the chair?

50:11.528 --> 50:12.897
- The only one.
- Yeah.

50:12.930 --> 50:13.965
Yeah.

50:13.998 --> 50:15.066
That's <i>Flashdance.</i>

50:15.099 --> 50:16.500
Oh, <i>Flashdance</i>
is what I'm thinking.

50:16.533 --> 50:18.535
<i>Dirty Dancing</i> with Jennifer
Grey and Patrick Swayze.

50:18.568 --> 50:21.505
For the final dance
she runs at them.

50:21.538 --> 50:23.007
She runs to Patrick Swayze

50:23.040 --> 50:26.676
- and he catches her and he lifts her off the ground.
- Okay.

50:26.710 --> 50:28.980
- Can you do that with Preston?
- I think I could do it with Preston.

50:29.013 --> 50:32.282
Yeah, work it out a little bit.
I want more than just a big jump.

50:35.987 --> 50:38.555
Oh, my God. I just shit my pants.

50:38.588 --> 50:41.525
- Shut up.
- You're joking, right?

50:42.559 --> 50:44.594
Did you really?

50:44.628 --> 50:47.765
I just shit my pants.
I just shit my fucking pants.

50:47.799 --> 50:50.433
- He did. He really did.
- I just shit my pants.

50:50.467 --> 50:51.969
I fucking shit my pants.

50:52.003 --> 50:53.503
- Why did you?
- Oh, my God.

50:53.537 --> 50:55.672
- Why did you shit your...
- I didn't mean to.

50:56.673 --> 50:57.809
Oh, man.

50:58.776 --> 51:00.477
Technically,
you shit our pants.

51:00.510 --> 51:03.915
The show must go on.
I don't see how that stops this.

51:03.948 --> 51:06.150
Let's go on.

51:06.184 --> 51:07.651
Ah, it's so gross.

51:07.684 --> 51:10.520
- Ah, dude.
- It's so fucking gross.

51:10.554 --> 51:14.724
You're full of shit.

51:14.759 --> 51:17.727
I should not have ate Indian
and Cuban food in the same day.

51:19.496 --> 51:23.000
We might be losing Lance again.

51:26.237 --> 51:27.437
Oh, my goodness.

51:27.470 --> 51:28.973
Oh, yuck.

51:29.841 --> 51:31.809
Oh, my God!

51:32.342 --> 51:34.344
I'm a grown man.

51:34.377 --> 51:36.413
I'm fucking 51 years old.

51:36.446 --> 51:38.448
Lance, we need
a closer shot of it.

51:39.083 --> 51:41.384
Oh! Oh, yuck.

51:43.420 --> 51:46.556
Preston should have pooped
before he came to work today.

51:46.590 --> 51:49.593
Fail to prepare.
Prepare to fail. Hmm.

51:51.028 --> 51:52.029
Marker.

51:54.031 --> 51:55.665
Hello, my name's
Johnny Knoxville

51:55.699 --> 51:57.400
and this is the marching band.

52:00.271 --> 52:02.372
Ladies!

52:22.193 --> 52:23.526
Ugh!

52:24.394 --> 52:26.163
That happened so fast!

52:29.100 --> 52:30.567
Damn, I got a hard head.

52:32.103 --> 52:33.503
Oh, my God.
You all right?

52:33.536 --> 52:36.439
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Oh, my God. He's bleeding.

52:36.473 --> 52:38.309
My hair line is receding.

52:38.342 --> 52:39.609
Steve-O, are you okay?

52:40.710 --> 52:42.179
You all right, Steve-O?

52:42.213 --> 52:43.314
- Oh, dude.
- Yo, you okay?

52:43.347 --> 52:44.614
Holy shit.

52:47.318 --> 52:49.854
Man, that happened
fast.

52:52.924 --> 52:56.394
All that practicing,
right out the window.

52:56.426 --> 52:59.931
I feel like I'm coming back to myself.
I can't remember nothing.

53:01.032 --> 53:03.267
- I didn't wimp out, did I?
- No, you didn't.

53:03.301 --> 53:05.937
You still got those million
dollar teeth, that's for sure.

53:10.374 --> 53:12.442
They're dropping like flies.

53:15.478 --> 53:17.081
I never know what to say
to Rick's camera.

53:17.114 --> 53:20.351
I feel like, I'm just like,
ah ha, man, I'm on <i>Jackass.</i>

53:20.384 --> 53:21.886
This is sick.

53:21.919 --> 53:25.790
I'm in the TV show
I used to watch, man.

53:25.823 --> 53:28.491
Everything I say is gonna end up
on the cutting room floor anyways.

53:28.525 --> 53:29.994
So it doesn't matter.

53:33.264 --> 53:34.932
- Hey, how you doin'?
- Hi.

53:34.966 --> 53:36.801
- Can I get a cold brew?
- Yeah, of course.

53:36.834 --> 53:37.935
Thanks.

53:42.206 --> 53:43.740
Do you mind if I get a photo?

53:43.774 --> 53:45.943
- Sure.
- I'm a big fan.

53:54.852 --> 53:56.053
Oh, my God!

54:01.392 --> 54:02.994
What did you guys do to Eric?

54:03.027 --> 54:06.663
Fuck, everything was perfect.
I was like,

54:06.696 --> 54:08.698
cold brew coffee, all right.

54:09.967 --> 54:11.634
Yes, please.

54:11.668 --> 54:14.038
"A picture? Okay, yeah, sure."

54:14.071 --> 54:15.773
Motherfucker.

54:40.231 --> 54:42.199
- What happened?
- What do you mean?

54:42.233 --> 54:43.968
He just got his nuts beat up.

54:44.869 --> 54:46.569
His balls are in his tummy.

54:46.603 --> 54:50.307
Oh. Ah, God damn it hurts.

54:50.341 --> 54:51.809
I think we gotta go one more.

54:55.046 --> 54:56.347
Can you do one more?

54:56.380 --> 54:58.215
Jeff said he needs one more.

55:00.751 --> 55:02.820
Hey, Wee Man,
help him get through that hole.

55:03.954 --> 55:05.423
I'll guide.

55:05.456 --> 55:07.425
They're not hanging as low as
they were.

55:07.458 --> 55:08.926
- Can you blame him?
- No.

55:08.959 --> 55:10.428
I'm getting 'em
right now.

55:10.461 --> 55:12.695
Ehren "Fluffer" McGhehey.

55:13.097 --> 55:15.232
Oh, my God.

55:16.666 --> 55:19.602
- Oh, fuck, it hurts.
- Hold on, get ready.

55:20.703 --> 55:23.074
- Okay, there.
- Here we go. Here we go.

55:24.508 --> 55:26.043
- Now we're primed.
- One more time.

55:26.077 --> 55:28.279
Ah, fuck you.

55:31.015 --> 55:32.582
You ready? Action.

55:33.284 --> 55:34.318
Everybody shut up!

55:35.119 --> 55:36.153
Boxer.

55:40.690 --> 55:42.326
Oh, Preston.

55:47.832 --> 55:51.268
Here with Steve-O and our
special handsome guest star,

55:51.302 --> 55:52.635
Machine Gun Kelly.

55:52.669 --> 55:54.704
This is the bicycle backhand

55:54.737 --> 55:56.606
and it's a competition.

55:56.639 --> 55:59.543
The faster you pedal your bike

55:59.577 --> 56:02.546
the faster the other guy's
hand goes back.

56:02.580 --> 56:04.014
And when it gets
to a certain point,

56:04.048 --> 56:06.016
boom, someone's gonna
get launched.

56:06.584 --> 56:08.519
You might be younger,

56:08.552 --> 56:10.921
taller, better looking,
richer,

56:10.955 --> 56:13.190
more talented,
but, motherfucker,

56:13.224 --> 56:14.325
I can ride.

56:15.392 --> 56:17.294
Steve-O's just eat up
with envy.

56:20.297 --> 56:22.632
Charlie, can you push that
hand in a little closer?

56:22.665 --> 56:25.069
Okay, I'm gonna push this
forward a little.

56:25.102 --> 56:27.538
Oh, shit!

56:27.571 --> 56:30.141
What the fuck?

56:30.174 --> 56:32.675
No one fucking even touched it.

56:33.110 --> 56:34.945
Oops. Oops.

56:36.981 --> 56:38.983
It happened so fast.

56:39.617 --> 56:41.051
Holy shit.

56:42.652 --> 56:44.255
Oh, my God, dude.

56:46.757 --> 56:48.392
Dry off, Steve-O,
it's going again.

56:51.028 --> 56:52.997
<i>Charlie just
touched it, it went boom.</i>

56:54.731 --> 56:57.067
<i>And now Steve-O
has to do it twice.</i>

56:58.469 --> 56:59.904
Um, we ready?

57:01.205 --> 57:02.506
On your marks...

57:02.540 --> 57:03.574
get set...

57:03.607 --> 57:04.875
Go!

57:04.909 --> 57:06.544
Pedal! Pedal! Pedal!

57:06.577 --> 57:08.612
Oh, you got this!

57:12.249 --> 57:14.118
Keep going! Keep going!

57:14.151 --> 57:15.152
Pedal!

57:17.555 --> 57:18.989
He's got 'em!

57:20.591 --> 57:24.028
Steve-O's winning.

57:24.061 --> 57:25.563
I don't know.
I don't know!

57:25.596 --> 57:26.931
Head up! Head up!

57:26.964 --> 57:28.265
Don't gas out, Steve-O.

57:28.299 --> 57:30.733
- Steve-O, you got it.
- You got it!

57:34.471 --> 57:36.473
Oh, God. It's so cold!

57:39.843 --> 57:41.345
Bunny, help him.

57:42.313 --> 57:43.881
The water's so fucking cold.

57:43.914 --> 57:45.583
Save me motherfucker, fuck.

57:45.616 --> 57:47.151
I need a towel.

57:48.552 --> 57:50.988
I totally forgot
I was a lifeguard.

57:51.021 --> 57:53.023
Dude, it's so cold.
That hurt so bad.

57:53.591 --> 57:54.892
You got towels? Okay.

57:54.925 --> 57:57.061
He's in shock right now,
look at his face.

57:57.094 --> 57:58.028
Yeah, dude.

57:58.062 --> 58:00.197
I thought my hand
was your hand.

58:04.068 --> 58:06.003
Maybe I didn't
explain it right.

58:06.036 --> 58:09.106
Dude, you said it wasn't gonna
feel like anything.

58:09.139 --> 58:10.774
<i>What hurt worse,
the cold water or the hand?</i>

58:10.808 --> 58:12.742
<i>It was the hand.
That was harsh.</i>

58:13.711 --> 58:14.979
<i>I was in the water like...</i>

58:15.479 --> 58:16.547
<i>Oh, I'm dead.</i>

58:16.580 --> 58:17.982
<i>That really worked.</i>

58:21.385 --> 58:22.586
How did you beat me?

58:22.620 --> 58:24.288
I don't know, dude.
I don't know, man.

58:24.321 --> 58:28.359
I was coming off my pedals,
it was not my strongest performance.

58:28.392 --> 58:29.593
Yours was really bad.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.969
I don't know what's
worse, the wedgie or these

58:39.003 --> 58:42.106
junkyard mattresses
you gotta land on?

58:42.139 --> 58:44.375
Look at that
pee-stained one right there.

58:44.408 --> 58:45.876
Ew, dude.

58:45.909 --> 58:48.445
Who do you think's more
afraid of being at that height?

58:49.179 --> 58:50.281
Preston or Zach?

58:50.314 --> 58:51.982
How are you with
heights, Zach?

58:52.016 --> 58:55.953
I already hate this.

58:55.986 --> 58:59.758
I'm Wee Man, and this
is the triple wedgie.

58:59.790 --> 59:05.062
All right.
Three, two, one. Jump!

59:13.237 --> 59:15.572
Okay! Put me down!

59:15.606 --> 59:17.207
Shit, put me down!

59:21.578 --> 59:24.048
My nuts!

59:27.752 --> 59:29.353
Well, that went well.

59:32.823 --> 59:35.125
<i>A little angel
hanging in the air.</i>

59:38.962 --> 59:41.598
Hollywood has long put
tremendous pressure on women

59:41.632 --> 59:43.167
to look youthful and sexy.

59:43.200 --> 59:45.436
And sometimes, the only way
to do that is with a team

59:45.469 --> 59:50.374
of medical professionals
and venomous insects.

59:51.909 --> 59:54.845
I'm Rachel,
and this is scorpion botox.

59:56.914 --> 59:59.016
This is actually
my first time performing

59:59.049 --> 01:00:01.051
this procedure.
To be honest with you.

01:00:01.085 --> 01:00:03.153
Oh, my God.
That stinger is huge.

01:00:04.288 --> 01:00:06.825
Pontius, I'm trusting you
with my lips.

01:00:06.857 --> 01:00:08.292
You can trust me,
I'm a doctor.

01:00:09.993 --> 01:00:12.396
You want to just put him
on my mouth

01:00:12.429 --> 01:00:13.597
and then fuck with him?

01:00:14.799 --> 01:00:16.801
- Past her lip.
- Ooh!

01:00:16.835 --> 01:00:18.435
Unh-unh. Unh-unh.

01:00:18.469 --> 01:00:21.105
Just relax
and enjoy the procedure.

01:00:22.039 --> 01:00:24.508
- Oh, he's on.
- Oh, no.

01:00:28.879 --> 01:00:29.913
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my...

01:00:29.947 --> 01:00:32.116
Ow!

01:00:32.149 --> 01:00:34.051
- Boob job!
- I don't want it on my boobs!

01:00:34.084 --> 01:00:36.120
I can't take him off your boob
unless you give me permission.

01:00:36.153 --> 01:00:37.856
Permission!

01:00:37.888 --> 01:00:39.824
Consent!

01:00:39.858 --> 01:00:41.525
I'm giving you consent!

01:00:42.993 --> 01:00:45.429
- 21st Century, people.
- Yeah.

01:00:45.462 --> 01:00:47.064
All right,
time to get stung in the face.

01:00:47.097 --> 01:00:49.666
- Whoa.
- This is intense.

01:00:53.003 --> 01:00:55.239
- Good job. Good job.
- He got it on my lip.

01:00:55.272 --> 01:00:58.375
You're ready
for the red carpet.

01:00:58.409 --> 01:01:01.813
Oh, shit. He's angry.

01:01:01.846 --> 01:01:04.448
- Oh, shit!
- Whoa!

01:01:04.481 --> 01:01:05.983
God dammit, doctor.

01:01:11.288 --> 01:01:13.257
He definitely stung my chin.

01:01:13.290 --> 01:01:15.894
Came for lips
and left with a new chin.

01:01:15.926 --> 01:01:17.394
Do you feel sexier?

01:01:17.428 --> 01:01:20.264
I'm feeling sexier by the minute.

01:01:20.297 --> 01:01:22.132
- Do you have one more in you?
- Yeah, sure.

01:01:22.166 --> 01:01:23.902
Let's make it count.

01:01:23.934 --> 01:01:26.236
- He's coming.
- You got it, Doc.

01:01:31.041 --> 01:01:33.878
Oh, my God,
that hurt so fucking bad.

01:01:33.912 --> 01:01:36.980
- Oh, my God, that hurt so bad.
- It's true, it got her good.

01:01:37.014 --> 01:01:39.283
<i>That hurt bad.</i>

01:01:39.316 --> 01:01:41.786
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:44.321
Her lips are really
swollen now. That shit worked.

01:01:44.354 --> 01:01:47.057
Oh, my lip is so fucked up,
you guys.

01:01:47.090 --> 01:01:48.258
I feel fucked up.

01:01:48.292 --> 01:01:50.027
But she looks great.

01:01:56.099 --> 01:01:58.368
- Whoa, a VCR.
- Huh?

01:01:58.402 --> 01:01:59.871
A VCR.

01:01:59.904 --> 01:02:02.206
So that's
a blast from the past, huh?

01:02:02.506 --> 01:02:03.507
Bam!

01:02:06.743 --> 01:02:09.246
Ah, that will work.

01:02:16.653 --> 01:02:18.722
Dang.

01:02:21.558 --> 01:02:24.328
Oh. Oh, my God.

01:02:27.064 --> 01:02:28.499
Whoa! What?

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:32.837
- What the hell?
- What the fuck!

01:02:32.871 --> 01:02:34.304
What happened?

01:02:35.405 --> 01:02:38.509
Holy crap, I fell on my face.

01:02:38.542 --> 01:02:41.078
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay, I just don't understand.

01:02:41.111 --> 01:02:43.380
I don't understand why
you were using the toilet.

01:02:43.413 --> 01:02:47.785
How did you end up here?
And you just took a shit...

01:02:47.819 --> 01:02:50.287
- <i>I didn't take anything.</i>
- <i>That was insane.</i>

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.089
<i>What kind of person
are you?</i>

01:02:54.358 --> 01:02:58.061
We have every available fan
in Los Angeles on set today.

01:02:58.095 --> 01:03:00.798
The two in the middle
go 100 miles an hour.

01:03:00.832 --> 01:03:05.302
I'm Jasper, and I'm about to take
this gold chair to the fucking moon.

01:03:13.912 --> 01:03:15.412
Oh!

01:03:17.982 --> 01:03:20.584
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:03:24.756 --> 01:03:26.456
Oh, my God!

01:03:27.691 --> 01:03:29.226
Oh, my God!

01:03:32.095 --> 01:03:34.131
We have a winner!

01:03:38.168 --> 01:03:39.536
<i>Holy shit.</i>

01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:41.738
<i>Oh, fuck.
I want to go again.</i>

01:03:43.607 --> 01:03:47.678
Now it's time for some
hot-shit water-skiing. Brah!

01:04:00.223 --> 01:04:02.693
We need a medic.
Medic!

01:04:04.428 --> 01:04:08.365
- Poops, you launched.
- Shit!

01:04:08.398 --> 01:04:12.436
- Fuck, dude.
- Dude. Poopies! Poopies!

01:04:12.703 --> 01:04:14.072
Poopies!

01:04:16.139 --> 01:04:18.542
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Poopies!

01:04:19.142 --> 01:04:20.377
It worked!

01:04:28.251 --> 01:04:30.420
Oh, shit!

01:04:31.055 --> 01:04:32.689
Dude.

01:04:36.861 --> 01:04:38.295
Quiet, please! Filming.

01:04:38.328 --> 01:04:41.899
Milk, milk, lemonade,
turn the corner and fudge is made.

01:04:41.933 --> 01:04:45.103
Stick your finger in the hole.
Now you've got a Tootsie...

01:04:47.105 --> 01:04:49.040
Hey, quiet please,
quiet please.

01:04:49.073 --> 01:04:54.277
Everybody quiet.
So he can sing "Milk, Milk, Lemonade."

01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.915
Okay this is serious.
Everybody shut up.

01:04:59.182 --> 01:05:00.885
All right,
let's get some smoke.

01:05:07.157 --> 01:05:12.396
Behold, our twisted souls have come to the
garden of death to dine with the devil.

01:05:12.429 --> 01:05:17.267
It's time to sacrifice Wee Man's
juicy ass to the raptor from hell.

01:05:18.669 --> 01:05:20.872
- Oh.
- Looking good.

01:05:22.172 --> 01:05:26.576
- Assume the position.
- Which way? This way?

01:05:28.512 --> 01:05:30.081
Just have fun with it.

01:05:33.583 --> 01:05:35.086
What do you have
in there?

01:05:35.119 --> 01:05:37.621
- Just me!
- That's not just you.

01:05:37.654 --> 01:05:38.722
Go ahead.

01:05:39.556 --> 01:05:41.793
Is that?
Wait, I'm not...

01:05:41.826 --> 01:05:44.261
That's him!

01:05:44.294 --> 01:05:47.731
When the beast
awakens, the monster arises.

01:05:50.567 --> 01:05:51.468
Touche.

01:05:51.501 --> 01:05:54.471
All right, whoa, dude, whoa!

01:05:54.504 --> 01:05:56.174
Stuff it in his butt
and let's go.

01:06:00.644 --> 01:06:03.981
Okay, there's enough
meat there.

01:06:09.352 --> 01:06:11.055
And a cherry on top.

01:06:14.125 --> 01:06:16.560
Let the unholy
sacrament begin.

01:06:16.593 --> 01:06:19.831
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!

01:06:19.864 --> 01:06:21.665
Ah, fuck!

01:06:22.332 --> 01:06:23.633
Come.

01:06:26.204 --> 01:06:28.705
Oh, okay!

01:06:28.739 --> 01:06:31.475
- You got this.
- Oh, no!

01:06:31.843 --> 01:06:33.343
Oh, shit!

01:06:34.178 --> 01:06:36.114
Feast on his cock.

01:06:42.153 --> 01:06:44.621
All right!
All right!

01:06:46.523 --> 01:06:49.493
Stop, man.
Stop, don't do that.

01:06:49.526 --> 01:06:53.998
As the blood rushes to the mast,
the beast awakens from his ancient slumber.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:05.176
- He's bleeding.
- Fuck. Come on.

01:07:05.209 --> 01:07:06.878
The beast
has drawn blood.

01:07:06.911 --> 01:07:10.114
Jeff. Jeff, can I get out?

01:07:10.148 --> 01:07:11.681
In a second.
In a second.

01:07:11.715 --> 01:07:14.651
- Jeff.
- I would, but the bird's right here.

01:07:14.684 --> 01:07:17.387
We're trying to get you
untied but the bird's here.

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:20.357
Before he returns to
hell, it's time for dessert.

01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:21.691
Come on, let's go.

01:07:25.395 --> 01:07:27.865
- Fuck!
- Don't kick the bird, Wee Man.

01:07:27.899 --> 01:07:29.299
I didn't kick the bird!

01:07:29.332 --> 01:07:30.835
It was the bird.

01:07:30.868 --> 01:07:33.871
- Okay, let me out.
- Let him out.

01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:40.278
Well, let's not let
this meat go to waste.

01:07:40.310 --> 01:07:42.079
- Dark Shark?
- Shut up.

01:07:42.113 --> 01:07:46.117
Hell, no, I ain't going near
none of that. Hell, nah.

01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:47.717
Look at that motherfucker.

01:07:47.752 --> 01:07:49.719
Dark Shark, come on,
just put it on your arm.

01:07:49.754 --> 01:07:51.688
Hell, nah,
are you crazy?

01:07:51.721 --> 01:07:53.557
- Yeah, Dark Shark.
- Come on!

01:07:53.590 --> 01:07:55.960
- Dark Shark!
- Yeah!

01:08:02.233 --> 01:08:05.937
- Hold your arm straight.
- Look at the camera.

01:08:08.638 --> 01:08:10.808
Don't move. Don't move.

01:08:10.842 --> 01:08:12.642
- Don't move.
- Stand still.

01:08:12.676 --> 01:08:14.111
Ow!
He's biting my arm!

01:08:14.145 --> 01:08:15.847
- No, he's not.
- He's clasping your arm.

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:19.817
- Look at Rick! Look at Rick!
- He's too heavy! Get him off me!

01:08:32.129 --> 01:08:35.564
Hey. Feel that shit, man. That
motherfucker was trying to hurt me, man.

01:08:36.733 --> 01:08:39.703
I'm kind of embarrassed
right now. Like...

01:08:40.837 --> 01:08:43.673
I came out of his penis, man.
That's how he acting?

01:08:45.442 --> 01:08:47.044
Hood card taken away.

01:08:50.412 --> 01:08:53.850
We have 15 gallons
of pig semen.

01:08:53.885 --> 01:08:57.420
Turns out, pigs produce the
most semen of any animal.

01:08:57.453 --> 01:09:00.557
Up to 17 ounces a load.

01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:05.162
And the guys are going to think they
are getting interviewed about the movie.

01:09:05.196 --> 01:09:08.933
And while they're sitting
there, something may happen.

01:09:10.801 --> 01:09:13.603
There's crust on top of it.

01:09:13.636 --> 01:09:17.774
Harvested gallons and gallons
of this. Does it smell like pig semen?

01:09:17.808 --> 01:09:18.809
Does it smell?

01:09:19.609 --> 01:09:21.112
Why are you looking at me
like that?

01:09:23.046 --> 01:09:25.482
Oh, no!

01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:28.886
It's semen all right.

01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:34.591
Why am I the one to puke?
I don't puke.

01:09:34.624 --> 01:09:36.193
I just wanted you
to smell it.

01:09:36.227 --> 01:09:37.594
I wanted
to surprise you.

01:09:37.627 --> 01:09:39.796
It's been a while since I ate
the horse semen but...

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:42.099
I think I prefer the pig.

01:09:43.433 --> 01:09:45.502
Bacon's better than horse
meat, right?

01:09:47.939 --> 01:09:51.876
I'm Tyler. And this is
the electric tap dance.

01:09:51.908 --> 01:09:54.611
While these beautiful men
dance away,

01:09:54.644 --> 01:09:56.613
I'm going to give my guy
Johnny Knoxville a look,

01:09:56.646 --> 01:09:59.216
and he's going to put
some pep in their step.

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:02.119
It's going to shock
the shit out of them.

01:10:02.153 --> 01:10:04.922
And if you're wondering if
the curtains match the drapes,

01:10:04.956 --> 01:10:08.259
let me tell you, I tore those
drapes out a long time ago.

01:10:11.162 --> 01:10:12.529
This is fucked.

01:10:15.498 --> 01:10:17.802
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:10:26.010 --> 01:10:29.213
That one hurt.

01:10:29.246 --> 01:10:31.514
Shanna, what the fuck
is this under the seat?

01:10:31.548 --> 01:10:32.716
What is this?

01:10:32.749 --> 01:10:33.951
What the fuck is that?

01:10:33.985 --> 01:10:36.153
- What?
- What is that?

01:10:36.187 --> 01:10:37.355
What is that?

01:10:37.388 --> 01:10:39.689
It's how they work,
look. This...

01:10:39.723 --> 01:10:41.993
In tune? It's a piano.

01:10:42.026 --> 01:10:44.661
No, it's metal right here.
I'm not fucking stupid.

01:10:44.694 --> 01:10:47.965
All right, let's go.
Quiet!

01:10:53.871 --> 01:10:56.506
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:10:57.975 --> 01:10:59.609
Step and step.

01:11:02.013 --> 01:11:03.580
Fuck!

01:11:08.219 --> 01:11:09.552
Oh, shit!

01:11:11.822 --> 01:11:13.290
Oh! Oh!

01:11:39.749 --> 01:11:41.752
I still feel it in my ass.

01:11:41.786 --> 01:11:44.789
- Yeah, Tyler.
- Those shits hit hard, man.

01:11:44.822 --> 01:11:47.224
How about a hand
for our dancers?

01:11:48.459 --> 01:11:50.127
Our showgirl!

01:11:51.862 --> 01:11:54.098
And our choreographer,
Michael Rooney.

01:11:55.366 --> 01:11:56.967
And Jeff Tremaine!

01:12:00.471 --> 01:12:02.506
Jeff should sit on that.

01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:04.975
Jeff, sit on that just once,
bro.

01:12:05.009 --> 01:12:07.311
Who got that remote?
I fucking hate Jeff.

01:12:10.414 --> 01:12:11.681
Wait, are you on it?

01:12:22.359 --> 01:12:23.961
Holy shit!

01:12:26.764 --> 01:12:29.100
All right, thanks man.
We'll do this real fast.

01:12:30.301 --> 01:12:32.903
So we're going to go
from that to this. I just...

01:12:32.937 --> 01:12:34.839
I got shocked so bad
so many times.

01:12:34.872 --> 01:12:36.273
Are we rolling, guys?

01:12:38.509 --> 01:12:42.645
He's about to have five gallons
of pig cum dumped on him.

01:12:42.679 --> 01:12:44.681
Damn, that sounds like me
in London.

01:12:46.217 --> 01:12:47.585
Oh, my God.

01:12:47.617 --> 01:12:50.154
But how did he fucking
fall for this?

01:12:50.821 --> 01:12:52.189
We don't question it.

01:12:52.223 --> 01:12:55.259
My favorite <i>Jackass</i> stunt
of all time with me in it

01:12:55.292 --> 01:12:57.660
is the firehose rodeo.

01:12:57.694 --> 01:13:00.630
To be honest,
I drank late into the night,

01:13:00.663 --> 01:13:02.333
woke up still drunk.

01:13:04.135 --> 01:13:05.903
Oh, that's cum!

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:18.015
That's five gallons
of pig cum.

01:13:18.048 --> 01:13:20.584
- You just got cummed on, dude!
- That's pig cum.

01:13:20.618 --> 01:13:22.286
- Oh!
- What is it?

01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:24.121
Pig cum.

01:13:24.155 --> 01:13:25.256
Pig cum.

01:13:27.525 --> 01:13:28.959
- Pig cum.
- That's pig cum?

01:13:28.993 --> 01:13:31.095
That's pig cum.
Five gallons.

01:13:31.128 --> 01:13:33.164
Honestly, I think
it tastes good.

01:13:33.197 --> 01:13:34.697
I'm a vegetarian!

01:13:38.701 --> 01:13:39.803
Watch the replay.

01:13:39.837 --> 01:13:41.105
Watch, watch, watch.

01:13:42.473 --> 01:13:44.775
Wait, wait, wait.
Watch his mouth.

01:13:45.242 --> 01:13:46.310
Stay on his mouth.

01:13:46.844 --> 01:13:49.046
Ready? And...

01:13:49.547 --> 01:13:51.081
Poof.

01:13:52.917 --> 01:13:55.352
- It went in his mouth.
- Right in his fucking mouth.

01:13:55.386 --> 01:13:56.554
You look great.

01:13:56.587 --> 01:13:58.255
I just said why can't I wear
my cool hat?

01:13:58.289 --> 01:13:59.290
Now I know why.

01:14:05.629 --> 01:14:07.264
Oh, God!

01:14:07.298 --> 01:14:10.234
Oh, my God, dude!

01:14:12.269 --> 01:14:15.172
So today, Ehren's going
to be wearing a shock collar.

01:14:15.206 --> 01:14:18.676
And I'm going to administer
a lie detector test.

01:14:18.708 --> 01:14:22.246
And if he's not truthful,
he's going to get stung.

01:14:25.216 --> 01:14:26.417
Jesus, man!

01:14:26.450 --> 01:14:27.618
You don't have to
feel that again

01:14:27.651 --> 01:14:29.486
as long as you
tell the truth.

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:31.455
- Okay, but...
- Come on.

01:14:31.488 --> 01:14:32.489
All right.

01:14:35.392 --> 01:14:37.428
What is your name?

01:14:37.461 --> 01:14:38.929
Kenneth Ehren McGhehey.

01:14:39.863 --> 01:14:42.866
Okay, next question, Ehren.

01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:45.803
Are you really allergic
to bees?

01:14:46.503 --> 01:14:47.838
Yes.

01:14:47.871 --> 01:14:51.375
Oh, boy,
I think he told a porky.

01:14:51.408 --> 01:14:57.514
Ow! I'm fucking allergic to bees, man.
I got tested by doctors!

01:14:58.515 --> 01:15:01.018
Stop it!

01:15:01.051 --> 01:15:02.219
- What?
- Just for a second.

01:15:02.253 --> 01:15:04.488
Just let me figure
some things out. Okay?

01:15:04.521 --> 01:15:05.522
Okay.

01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:08.158
I got to get out
of this thing.

01:15:08.192 --> 01:15:11.562
- This will keep you immune to the bees.
- Oh, come on.

01:15:11.595 --> 01:15:13.097
Are you fucking kidding me
right now?

01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:14.498
I am trapped.

01:15:14.531 --> 01:15:16.367
And you are putting honey
on me.

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.236
- And salmon?
- Yeah.

01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:20.638
What are you doing?

01:15:20.671 --> 01:15:22.306
Ehren, please relax.

01:15:23.607 --> 01:15:25.009
You're making this
much worse

01:15:25.042 --> 01:15:26.277
on yourself
than it needs to be.

01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:28.345
No, it's not much worse,
it is that worse.

01:15:28.379 --> 01:15:29.446
- No.
- Please.

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:30.714
Now I'm stuck in a room.

01:15:30.748 --> 01:15:33.417
Everyone's going to leave.
Lights out.

01:15:33.450 --> 01:15:36.053
The fucking honey
is in my eye!

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.322
Oh, shit.

01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:47.665
Oh, my God.

01:15:49.133 --> 01:15:50.801
- I can't believe it.
- No fucking way.

01:15:50.834 --> 01:15:52.369
Look at his face!

01:15:52.403 --> 01:15:54.872
Ehren, remain calm.

01:16:03.414 --> 01:16:05.015
Talk to it, Ehren.

01:16:05.049 --> 01:16:06.116
Try to calm it down.

01:16:06.150 --> 01:16:07.551
Oh, no.
He's going for the salmon.

01:16:08.485 --> 01:16:11.288
- Oh, no.
- Hi, bear.

01:16:11.322 --> 01:16:13.957
Are you really
allergic to bees, Ehren?

01:16:18.862 --> 01:16:20.799
- Fuck!
- You're telling a porky!

01:16:20.831 --> 01:16:22.566
I didn't even get to answer.

01:16:24.902 --> 01:16:27.806
- No, no.
- Ooh!

01:16:31.408 --> 01:16:33.610
Ehren, don't make
any sudden movements.

01:16:38.482 --> 01:16:40.551
Oh.

01:16:40.584 --> 01:16:42.821
There's nothing
more in there!

01:16:42.853 --> 01:16:44.321
There's nothing more
in there!

01:16:44.355 --> 01:16:46.490
Mr. Bear,
eat that dick.

01:16:48.359 --> 01:16:51.028
I'm ready to come out
of this. I...

01:16:51.628 --> 01:16:53.097
Uh-oh.

01:16:53.130 --> 01:16:54.732
Fuck, dude,
he tried to bite my hand.

01:16:54.766 --> 01:16:57.668
He's trying to bite my hand.
He's trying to bite my hand.

01:16:57.701 --> 01:16:59.303
He's trying to bite my hand.

01:17:00.671 --> 01:17:02.673
I don't know what...
Oh, my God!

01:17:02.706 --> 01:17:04.007
Oh, my God!

01:17:04.475 --> 01:17:05.943
Oh, God!

01:17:06.610 --> 01:17:07.812
Oh, God!

01:17:07.846 --> 01:17:10.481
Ow! Oh, my God,
he's going for my dick.

01:17:10.514 --> 01:17:12.983
- I gotta go in.
- He's going for my dick, dude.

01:17:13.016 --> 01:17:16.253
I wanna get outta here, man,
like I'm serious.

01:17:16.887 --> 01:17:18.155
Please.

01:17:18.823 --> 01:17:20.023
Please!

01:17:21.492 --> 01:17:24.395
Yeah, Ehren!

01:17:26.865 --> 01:17:28.800
Yeah, get him out of it.

01:17:28.833 --> 01:17:31.135
I feel for you, bro.

01:17:31.168 --> 01:17:32.871
- I feel for you.
- You're good, you're done.

01:17:32.903 --> 01:17:34.004
You're done.

01:17:34.037 --> 01:17:35.506
Is it... Is it actually over?

01:17:38.843 --> 01:17:40.644
Yeah, buddy.

01:17:41.512 --> 01:17:42.546
Oh, my God.

01:17:44.381 --> 01:17:47.651
All right. I think this is
a perfect amount of "in it".

01:17:47.684 --> 01:17:48.952
All right, let me...

01:17:48.986 --> 01:17:50.087
Who's got it?

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:51.155
- I thought I had it.
- I got it.

01:17:51.188 --> 01:17:52.689
All right.
This is gnarly.

01:17:53.323 --> 01:17:54.925
This is a trip.

01:17:54.958 --> 01:17:57.661
While you guys are tightening,
I'm going to have to hold the tip of it

01:17:57.694 --> 01:17:59.930
just to keep it steady, huh?

01:17:59.963 --> 01:18:02.666
Ooh, it's starting to take
a firm grip.

01:18:02.699 --> 01:18:03.967
Look at it!

01:18:05.135 --> 01:18:07.204
This is some medieval shit.

01:18:07.237 --> 01:18:10.107
- This is all the way clear.
- No thanks, bro.

01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:12.176
- Watch it, man.
- It's tight, man.

01:18:12.877 --> 01:18:13.977
Oooh.

01:18:14.011 --> 01:18:15.012
That don't hurt?

01:18:15.045 --> 01:18:16.079
That's the weird part,

01:18:16.113 --> 01:18:17.347
it doesn't really hurt.

01:18:17.381 --> 01:18:18.348
Oh, my God.

01:18:18.382 --> 01:18:21.385
Don't look now,
but it's flat as a pancake.

01:18:21.418 --> 01:18:24.923
A lot of people ask, "What will
<i>Jackass</i> be like once we're older?"

01:18:24.955 --> 01:18:27.291
Well, it'll get more mature.

01:18:30.494 --> 01:18:32.229
Me and the homie be Googling
weird shit,

01:18:32.262 --> 01:18:34.799
but like this would never
pop in their head.

01:18:34.833 --> 01:18:36.400
This is brand new.

01:18:36.433 --> 01:18:38.669
Yeah, you're for sure never
gonna be president.

01:18:40.270 --> 01:18:41.873
You never know.
I'd vote for him.

01:18:41.906 --> 01:18:44.007
Yeah!

01:18:45.742 --> 01:18:47.144
The ball flap.

01:18:47.177 --> 01:18:48.479
Wow!

01:18:52.249 --> 01:18:54.251
Yes! Oh, my God!

01:18:56.453 --> 01:18:57.287
Wow!

01:18:57.321 --> 01:18:58.989
Now we know
what that's all about.

01:19:03.427 --> 01:19:06.931
So, here we are
back at the bullring.

01:19:06.965 --> 01:19:11.268
Even at a time when I wanted to
die, I wouldn't get in the bullring.

01:19:11.301 --> 01:19:13.972
You know, when life
was its least valuable

01:19:14.004 --> 01:19:15.974
I would have no part
in this bullshit.

01:19:16.006 --> 01:19:17.641
And it's my
least favorite thing.

01:19:17.674 --> 01:19:19.343
The movie's going so well.

01:19:19.376 --> 01:19:21.378
Why the fuck
are we doing this?

01:19:27.752 --> 01:19:29.486
God, dude!

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:31.923
- I don't think he's very happy.
- No.

01:19:31.956 --> 01:19:33.056
- Have you been around bulls before?
- No.

01:19:33.090 --> 01:19:34.124
I've never been around
a bull

01:19:34.157 --> 01:19:35.592
in my whole entire life.

01:19:35.626 --> 01:19:36.627
Not a real one.

01:19:37.862 --> 01:19:39.062
Oh, shit.

01:19:39.363 --> 01:19:40.397
Oh, shit.

01:19:42.901 --> 01:19:45.870
Hello,
I am Johnny the Magnificent.

01:19:45.904 --> 01:19:51.308
Today, I am going to wow you with my
supreme skills of prestidigitation.

01:19:53.011 --> 01:19:55.479
Oh, fuck! Oh, God! Oh, shit!

01:19:55.914 --> 01:19:57.147
Woo-hoo-hoo!

01:20:01.051 --> 01:20:03.086
Oh, no! Oh, shit!

01:20:04.187 --> 01:20:06.123
Oh, no.

01:20:06.156 --> 01:20:07.591
Jesus.

01:20:07.624 --> 01:20:08.760
There we go.

01:20:15.033 --> 01:20:16.099
He's okay.

01:20:16.133 --> 01:20:17.734
Hey, J, talk to me. You okay?

01:20:17.769 --> 01:20:19.369
You all right?

01:20:20.170 --> 01:20:22.139
You doing okay?
Johnny?

01:20:23.473 --> 01:20:24.976
He's gettin' back,
he's coming to.

01:20:25.009 --> 01:20:26.276
He's coming back, yeah.

01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:27.711
You all right?

01:20:27.744 --> 01:20:29.047
That was a violent brawl.

01:20:29.079 --> 01:20:30.581
One-sided to be sure.

01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:33.885
Gnarly.

01:20:33.918 --> 01:20:35.252
So we good, Jeff?

01:20:35.285 --> 01:20:36.888
You got exactly
what you wanted.

01:20:36.921 --> 01:20:38.589
- Yeah, Knox.
- Yeah, Knox.

01:20:38.622 --> 01:20:40.157
Oh, fuck.

01:20:40.190 --> 01:20:41.893
So what happened
after it hit me?

01:20:41.926 --> 01:20:43.795
Dude, it's gnarly.

01:20:43.828 --> 01:20:45.395
This is you, this is the bull.

01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:50.434
<i>He didn't
mess around, dude.</i>

01:20:50.467 --> 01:20:52.436
<i>He turned around
and just nailed him.</i>

01:20:52.469 --> 01:20:54.404
- <i>That was insane.</i>
- <i>Yeah, Knox!</i>

01:20:54.438 --> 01:20:57.240
<i>It's probably the
biggest hit you've ever taken.</i>

01:20:58.141 --> 01:21:00.243
<i>And that's why
he is the captain.</i>

01:21:00.277 --> 01:21:02.713
That bull didn't like
fucking magic.

01:21:04.748 --> 01:21:06.249
Yeah, Knox, we love you!

01:21:06.283 --> 01:21:07.484
Love you!

01:21:08.019 --> 01:21:09.152
Captain!

01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:13.791
Hello, Lance.

01:21:14.993 --> 01:21:16.828
- Hello there.
- How are you?

01:21:16.861 --> 01:21:18.195
Good. What's new?

01:21:18.228 --> 01:21:22.800
Ah, I got a broken wrist,
broken rib, concussion.

01:21:22.834 --> 01:21:25.469
<i>But I was supposed to
pour the milk in the hat,</i>

01:21:25.502 --> 01:21:29.874
and then put the hat back on,
and no milk come out.

01:21:29.907 --> 01:21:31.109
Did milk come out?

01:21:31.141 --> 01:21:32.476
There was some milk
on the...

01:21:32.509 --> 01:21:33.677
Oh, shit!

01:21:36.279 --> 01:21:39.083
These guys are gonna get
on that centrifuge back there,

01:21:39.117 --> 01:21:41.853
drink as much milk
as they can.

01:21:41.886 --> 01:21:43.253
We're gonna see what happens.

01:21:43.286 --> 01:21:45.722
This is the vomitron.

01:21:45.757 --> 01:21:46.891
- Woo!
- Yeah!

01:21:46.924 --> 01:21:48.525
Taste the rainbow.

01:21:48.558 --> 01:21:51.261
- Taste the rainbow.
- Come on, guys.

01:21:51.294 --> 01:21:54.464
If this is a race to see
who vomits first,

01:21:54.498 --> 01:21:57.501
I think I might have it.

01:21:58.702 --> 01:22:01.105
Zach, aim your head down
when you throw up.

01:22:01.139 --> 01:22:03.373
It's comin' right at me.

01:22:03.407 --> 01:22:04.608
Oh, God.

01:22:04.641 --> 01:22:07.145
I can barely taste
the pig cum in this.

01:22:07.210 --> 01:22:09.947
Right?

01:22:09.981 --> 01:22:11.916
All right, chug, chug.

01:22:11.949 --> 01:22:13.183
Oh, shit.

01:22:13.684 --> 01:22:15.185
Here we go! Fuck me!

01:22:15.218 --> 01:22:16.386
Just look at me, Eric.

01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:18.588
- Pound that milk!
- Yeah, chug it!

01:22:19.556 --> 01:22:20.590
Oh.

01:22:20.624 --> 01:22:22.126
- Fuck it.
- Is he already puking?

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:23.593
Jasper!

01:22:23.627 --> 01:22:26.363
- Drink your fucking milk!
- I'm trying! I'm fuckin' trying!

01:22:26.396 --> 01:22:29.067
Let's pick up the speed!
Pick up the speed!

01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:30.734
Whoo! It's pickin' up!

01:22:31.601 --> 01:22:34.638
Ah! Ahh!

01:22:36.974 --> 01:22:38.642
What the fuck
did you eat?

01:22:39.209 --> 01:22:40.544
What did he eat?

01:22:42.679 --> 01:22:43.680
Go, go, go!

01:22:51.923 --> 01:22:53.758
Oh, shit!

01:22:53.791 --> 01:22:55.827
What's happening now?

01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:57.227
There's an army truck.

01:22:58.029 --> 01:22:59.463
Holy shit.

01:23:00.198 --> 01:23:01.866
Oh, shit, Imma pass out!

01:23:02.299 --> 01:23:03.366
I'm passing out!

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.169
Zach's passing out?

01:23:05.203 --> 01:23:06.804
I'm passing out.

01:23:06.838 --> 01:23:10.307
I can't drink the milk.
I'm going too fast.

01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:13.845
Red Robin Three.
This is Big Hank Two.

01:23:13.878 --> 01:23:16.379
I want the perimeter bombed,
God damn it!

01:23:16.413 --> 01:23:18.582
Bomb them into the stone age,
son!

01:23:22.053 --> 01:23:23.620
Stop!

01:23:26.356 --> 01:23:28.592
Stop! Stop!

01:23:30.128 --> 01:23:33.164
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

01:23:33.197 --> 01:23:34.397
What the fuck?

01:23:42.672 --> 01:23:44.274
Oh, no!

01:23:44.976 --> 01:23:46.811
It's a paintball time!

01:23:47.544 --> 01:23:48.880
Fire!

01:23:53.217 --> 01:23:55.787
Stop! Stop!

01:23:56.386 --> 01:23:59.389
No more! Oh!

01:23:59.422 --> 01:24:01.491
I got shot
in the fuckin' mouth.

01:24:05.897 --> 01:24:07.965
Ah! Dave! Dave!

01:24:07.999 --> 01:24:09.967
Get on the stretcher!

01:24:10.001 --> 01:24:11.368
Get on the stretcher.

01:24:14.504 --> 01:24:16.841
Don't get me! Ah! Fuck!

01:24:27.450 --> 01:24:29.719
Someday this war is gonna end.

01:24:34.926 --> 01:24:36.393
I don't know how to get out.

01:24:37.028 --> 01:24:39.362
Help me, Eric! Help me!

01:24:42.834 --> 01:24:45.970
I love the smell of paintballs
in the morning!

01:24:58.548 --> 01:24:59.549
Ow!

01:25:01.185 --> 01:25:04.856
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:25:05.488 --> 01:25:07.792
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:25:11.028 --> 01:25:12.362
Ow! Oh!

01:25:12.395 --> 01:25:15.766
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:25:16.399 --> 01:25:17.869
Fuck, Jeff!

01:25:19.303 --> 01:25:20.838
Look at Dave's face!

01:25:20.872 --> 01:25:22.106
Look at...

01:25:22.139 --> 01:25:26.710
- Oh, my God!
- Fuck off! Fuck all the way off!

01:25:27.345 --> 01:25:30.214
Dude, what the fuck?

01:25:30.248 --> 01:25:32.649
- I'm sorry, bro.
- That fuckin' hurt!

01:25:33.516 --> 01:25:35.485
Get out there, get out there.

01:25:35.518 --> 01:25:37.255
Poopies... Poopies is hurt.

01:25:37.288 --> 01:25:39.323
- Are we done?
- Let me see.

01:25:39.357 --> 01:25:43.261
- Oh, my God.
- Oh my God, damn!

01:25:43.294 --> 01:25:44.628
My dick really hurts, man.

01:25:44.661 --> 01:25:46.063
He got shot in the dick.

01:25:46.964 --> 01:25:47.999
That was fucked!

01:25:50.234 --> 01:25:51.668
Oh, God. Look at that.

01:25:52.736 --> 01:25:54.171
It's gotta be
over, dude.

01:25:54.205 --> 01:25:55.773
I can't get any more hurt.

01:25:55.806 --> 01:25:57.875
I think we're all the way
finished, we're through.

01:25:58.376 --> 01:25:59.777
Stick a fork in it.

01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:01.812
We're done.

01:26:05.082 --> 01:26:06.784
Oooh, is that
your tooth, dude?

01:26:07.318 --> 01:26:08.518
Wow!

01:26:08.551 --> 01:26:10.354
That's a wrap on the movie.

01:26:28.505 --> 01:26:29.739
Oh!

01:26:30.473 --> 01:26:32.910
Huh?

01:26:38.983 --> 01:26:39.984
Oh, my God!

01:26:42.253 --> 01:26:43.453
Oh, shit!

01:26:43.486 --> 01:26:45.655
- Watch him get hit in the nuts!
- Oh, no!

01:26:46.489 --> 01:26:47.758
Oh, fuck!

01:26:48.692 --> 01:26:50.727
Did anyone even film that?

01:26:50.761 --> 01:26:51.929
He was.

01:26:57.567 --> 01:27:00.404
Oh, shit!

01:27:00.438 --> 01:27:05.076
This is the cup that we used for P.K.
to hit me in the dick.

01:27:05.109 --> 01:27:06.543
And apparently it worked.

01:27:09.447 --> 01:27:11.648
But there's a big giant
dent in it.

01:27:17.989 --> 01:27:19.123
Are you kidding me?

01:27:19.622 --> 01:27:20.825
Flamingo.

01:27:21.691 --> 01:27:23.660
Flamingo, pelican, eh!

01:27:23.693 --> 01:27:24.795
Give that a whirl, yeah.

01:27:24.829 --> 01:27:26.563
Probably, like,
her least concern.

01:27:28.332 --> 01:27:29.800
That's awesome.

01:27:29.834 --> 01:27:31.802
I didn't even know he could go
that fast.

01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:38.909
Oh, my God!

01:27:38.943 --> 01:27:41.045
I got shot with the
elephant gun yesterday.

01:27:41.879 --> 01:27:43.513
Yeah, Parks!

01:27:43.546 --> 01:27:46.884
Good job, dude!
You launched!

01:27:46.917 --> 01:27:49.253
That was crazy.

01:27:49.286 --> 01:27:53.090
Oh, fuck, yeah, you the main one
talkin' shit. Motherfucker, do it!

01:27:53.124 --> 01:27:54.925
That's a hot mama.

01:27:54.959 --> 01:27:55.793
Who's this?

01:27:55.826 --> 01:27:57.361
He's my offspring.

01:27:57.395 --> 01:27:59.263
For real, like, I've been
watching <i>Jackass</i>

01:27:59.296 --> 01:28:03.067
- since I was like 12 years old, 10 years old.
- Right.

01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:06.303
But it's definitely a big impact
on life and guess what? We're here.

01:28:06.337 --> 01:28:07.938
We're here, baby!

01:28:07.972 --> 01:28:10.207
Poopies doesn't have the
biggest penis in the world,

01:28:10.241 --> 01:28:12.777
not the second biggest either.

01:28:12.810 --> 01:28:15.645
I think I have the smallest
one out of the whole group.

01:28:15.678 --> 01:28:21.152
That was what... That was what I was
most nervous about is showing it on...

01:28:21.185 --> 01:28:22.453
to the whole world.

01:28:22.486 --> 01:28:25.322
- Yeah.
- But that's what we're here for.

01:28:30.727 --> 01:28:33.630
My name's Irving Zissman,
and I'm a prick.

01:28:35.732 --> 01:28:37.234
And that's the truth.

01:28:38.169 --> 01:28:40.703
I kind of feel like praying
right now.

01:28:40.737 --> 01:28:42.907
Boom, boom. boom, boom.

01:28:46.277 --> 01:28:47.610
Was that a prank?

01:28:52.416 --> 01:28:54.385
Y'all ain't right, man.

01:28:54.418 --> 01:28:57.354
That was beautiful.

01:28:57.388 --> 01:28:58.956
I love you guys, man,
for that.

01:28:58.989 --> 01:29:01.459
Did they put that goofy-ass
beard on in makeup?

01:29:01.492 --> 01:29:02.827
You a hater.
I knew he was gonna come over

01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:05.563
and say some fuck shit
about my nice-ass beard.

01:29:05.595 --> 01:29:07.965
Yeah, 'cause that's...

01:29:11.268 --> 01:29:12.937
Oh, my God!

01:29:12.970 --> 01:29:14.371
Holy fuck.

01:29:18.542 --> 01:29:20.945
Oh, my God, dude.

01:29:21.345 --> 01:29:22.913
Come on, Zach!

01:29:26.517 --> 01:29:27.751
Oh, God!

01:29:29.587 --> 01:29:32.156
Oh, my, you missed the bucket.

01:29:34.925 --> 01:29:37.194
I'm in the weirdest position.

01:29:37.228 --> 01:29:40.264
All right, let's get that
camera ready with the 16 mil,

01:29:40.297 --> 01:29:41.932
right down Main Street.

01:29:46.736 --> 01:29:48.172
- Hey, Rick.
- Hey!

01:29:58.415 --> 01:29:59.884
I was trying to look stoked.

01:30:03.354 --> 01:30:05.256
There it is!

01:30:05.289 --> 01:30:07.024
First time you got cummed on?

01:30:07.057 --> 01:30:08.626
Yeah. For sure.

01:30:08.658 --> 01:30:09.960
Or the second.

01:30:14.664 --> 01:30:17.301
- I am, I have no...
- Okay, listen.

01:30:17.334 --> 01:30:18.701
Did we get it?

01:30:20.171 --> 01:30:22.306
- You just gotta take it.
- You just gotta go.

01:30:22.339 --> 01:30:24.308
- Take it like a man.
- You just gotta take it.

01:30:29.079 --> 01:30:30.080
Cut! Cut!

01:30:30.713 --> 01:30:32.316
That's good.

01:30:32.349 --> 01:30:34.285
Three, two, one!

01:30:36.887 --> 01:30:40.324
- Ow, ow, ow!
- Ow, my hand's burned.

01:30:40.357 --> 01:30:41.992
Ow, my hand's burning!

01:30:42.026 --> 01:30:43.427
Hey, Dave.

01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:44.762
- Dave, you good, bro?
- Yeah.

01:30:44.795 --> 01:30:45.896
I'm all right,
I'll be all right.

01:30:45.930 --> 01:30:47.198
I'm just going... I am burned.

01:30:49.967 --> 01:30:50.968
Oh, God!

01:30:51.235 --> 01:30:52.236
Fuck!

01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:57.274
How's his head?

01:31:01.445 --> 01:31:03.080
Can't have nothin' nice,
can I?

01:31:06.217 --> 01:31:08.886
Will you make him an actual
coffee, Stephanie, thank you.

01:31:08.919 --> 01:31:11.288
- Oh, dude.
- Here, I made you another one.

01:31:11.322 --> 01:31:12.323
Awesome.

01:31:30.007 --> 01:31:31.675
That's actually
not the milkshake.

01:31:31.709 --> 01:31:32.910
All right!

01:31:33.711 --> 01:31:35.479
Dude wanted to be
just like me.

01:31:36.547 --> 01:31:38.549
What? Dude, that's sick.

01:31:38.582 --> 01:31:41.619
Trailer moment.
Don't move.

01:31:46.090 --> 01:31:47.091
We ready?

01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:50.261
Huh?

01:31:50.628 --> 01:31:52.129
He's ready.

01:31:52.162 --> 01:31:54.265
So we're all ready to do this?

01:31:54.298 --> 01:31:55.366
We're ready.

01:31:55.399 --> 01:31:57.134
Everyone rolling?

01:31:57.167 --> 01:31:59.303
Oh, no! Oh, no!

01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:04.875
Oh, my God!

01:32:04.908 --> 01:32:07.878
- Wow!
- That is legit right there.

01:32:07.911 --> 01:32:10.314
Let me get in on that one.

01:32:10.347 --> 01:32:12.850
I'm running around in a
G-string for a living.

01:32:12.883 --> 01:32:14.652
<i>You are making a living
at that right now.</i>

01:32:14.685 --> 01:32:15.719
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:32:15.754 --> 01:32:16.954
<i>It looked good on you.</i>

01:32:18.757 --> 01:32:22.426
I summon Sarcophilus Satanicus

01:32:22.459 --> 01:32:26.997
to come and eat the flesh
of the wallaby.

01:32:27.031 --> 01:32:29.099
I can totally see through
Steve-O's.

01:32:34.905 --> 01:32:37.975
This is so gross, man.

01:32:38.008 --> 01:32:40.044
Can we get one with the finger
in your mouth?

01:32:43.213 --> 01:32:46.317
I'm gonna shit my pants before
we get to that fuckin' place.

01:32:46.350 --> 01:32:49.019
I'm Dave England
and I got to take a shit.

01:32:53.257 --> 01:32:55.492
I hope you're gonna
get that son of a bitch.

01:32:55.526 --> 01:32:59.129
I took a huge coil in
there and it stunk so bad.

01:32:59.163 --> 01:33:02.833
Weren't you on <i>90210</i> not too long ago...

01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:11.275
Hey, come here. Jump...

01:33:13.778 --> 01:33:16.113
Get it off!
Get it off!

01:33:16.146 --> 01:33:18.048
Hold the collar up
so I can see it.

01:33:21.618 --> 01:33:23.554
Did I get you?

01:33:23.587 --> 01:33:28.827
We're going to convince Kosick that
this is a piece of audio equipment.

01:33:28.859 --> 01:33:30.961
Unbeknownst to him,
he's gonna be shocked.

01:33:30.994 --> 01:33:32.363
Yeah, it's a microphone.

01:33:32.396 --> 01:33:33.397
I don't hear nothing.

01:33:40.371 --> 01:33:41.605
Stop it now. Stop it.

01:33:44.608 --> 01:33:46.009
Hey, let's eat.

01:33:46.043 --> 01:33:47.678
Who wants some?

01:33:47.711 --> 01:33:48.912
Face your fears.

01:33:50.881 --> 01:33:55.185
He put his hands down!
What a pussy. Don't look.

01:33:55.219 --> 01:33:58.255
Dude, just kick back.
It's not like we really care.

01:33:59.456 --> 01:34:00.657
Dude, dude!

01:34:03.394 --> 01:34:04.695
Ow, ow! Dude!

01:34:04.728 --> 01:34:06.430
Dude! Chill!

01:34:06.463 --> 01:34:07.965
Chill, dude!

01:34:07.998 --> 01:34:09.433
It's for the movie, dude.

01:34:10.033 --> 01:34:12.469
He kicked your ass, dude.

01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:18.542
How's Raab not in this?

01:34:18.575 --> 01:34:20.477
I'm the smart one.
I already know what's going to happen.

01:34:20.511 --> 01:34:23.313
Hey, I'm Raab Himself
and this is Bungy-Wedgie.

01:34:32.956 --> 01:34:34.358
Watch out.

01:34:39.663 --> 01:34:40.697
Stop it!

01:34:44.769 --> 01:34:46.136
Oh! You got my nuts!

01:34:47.004 --> 01:34:48.605
Oh, man, I'm stuck.

01:35:07.090 --> 01:35:09.359
And cut.
