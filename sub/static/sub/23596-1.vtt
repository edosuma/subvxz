[MUSIC CONTINUES]

06:25.062 --> 06:29.889
Today we'll be discussing Erik Erikson
and his psychosocial development theory.

06:30.733 --> 06:34.825
One of the key elements of Erikson's
psychosocial stage theory...

06:34.905 --> 06:37.127
...is the development of the ego identity.

06:37.207 --> 06:40.730
Now, the ego identity, if you will,
is the conscious sense of self...

06:40.810 --> 06:42.912
...that we all develop
through social interaction.

06:42.992 --> 06:46.970
According to Eriksson, our ego
identity is constantly changing...

06:47.050 --> 06:49.239
...through our daily
interactions with others.

06:49.319 --> 06:52.110
He also believed that
a personal sense of competence...

06:52.190 --> 06:54.653
...motivates our daily actions and behaviors.

06:55.191 --> 07:00.884
Each stage in his theory is concerned
with becoming competent in an area of life.

07:00.964 --> 07:04.889
If the stage is handled well,
the person will feel a sense of mastery...

07:04.969 --> 07:07.725
...also referred to as ego strength.

07:07.805 --> 07:09.827
If the stage is managed poorly, however...

07:09.907 --> 07:12.978
...the person will emerge
with a sense of inadequacy.

07:14.945 --> 07:17.414
Isn't that right, Mr. Lee?

07:19.850 --> 07:21.871
Sorry, Mr. Henderson?

07:21.951 --> 07:26.811
Perhaps you'd like to share with the class
the sixth stage of Erikson's theory.

07:27.691 --> 07:30.546
Or would you rather give us
an update on the weather?

07:30.626 --> 07:32.629
[LAUGHTER]

07:42.805 --> 07:46.278
The sixth stage revolves around
intimacy versus isolation.

07:47.210 --> 07:50.268
This stage covers the period of early
adulthood that we are just entering now...

07:50.348 --> 07:53.036
...as we start to explore
personal relationships.

07:53.116 --> 07:55.917
Erikson believed it was vital that
we develop close relationships...

07:55.997 --> 07:58.659
...that are committed and secure.

08:00.457 --> 08:04.115
That's very good, David. It appears you're
already quite familiar with Mr. Erikson...

surrounding the sixth stage.
