Then why'd you make me
do all this?

06:16.973 --> 06:18.173

06:50.340 --> 06:52.506
You know,
I have been called that.

you know, he's just afraid

07:13.846 --> 07:15.346
if he gives you credit

07:15.413 --> 07:17.880
he'll have to cut you in

07:17.946 --> 07:19.013
Oh, okay.

07:58.813 --> 08:01.186
Okay, a bottle of giggle water.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.320
Dom Perignon.

08:04.386 --> 08:05.653
Either you got the gig

08:05.720 --> 08:07.753
or they got one hell
of a consolation prize

08:07.820 --> 08:09.320
at that theatre.

08:09.386 --> 08:12.486
(Synclaire)
'Actually, Synclaire James
didn't get the job.'

08:16.353 --> 08:17.920
James Overton did.

08:17.986 --> 08:18.986
[cork popping]

08:27.353 --> 08:30.220
Um, baby,
I'm, I'm perplexed.

08:30.286 --> 08:33.419
Um, they want you to play
this new character in the show?

08:33.486 --> 08:36.120
No, no, they think
I am this new character.

08:36.186 --> 08:38.253
See, all the female roles
were filled.

08:38.320 --> 08:41.120
I kept thinking about what
you said, "Whatever it takes."

08:41.186 --> 08:44.520
So, I stopped by the army
surplus, I popped on this fro

08:44.586 --> 08:47.553
and I gave birth to
James Overton.

08:47.620 --> 08:51.720
Yo, dog, but you can call me
Jimmy, I'm in this piece.

08:53.153 --> 08:54.120
Don't do that.

08:55.620 --> 08:58.786
I got one troubling question,
my friends still in there?

08:59.720 --> 09:00.893
Oh, yeah, held on by God

09:00.960 --> 09:02.426
and a whole bunch
of duct tape, look.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.493
Look, baby, you know
am happy for you

09:05.560 --> 09:07.560
but you can't do this
day after day.

09:07.626 --> 09:10.326
And frankly, this is
a little dishonest.

09:10.393 --> 09:13.693
Hey, dishonesty is
the essence of acting.

09:13.760 --> 09:16.326
Now, listen, I know it's gonna
take some getting used to

09:16.393 --> 09:18.626
but I promise you, nothing
around here is going to change.

09:18.693 --> 09:20.260
Now, before I get outta
these clothes

09:20.326 --> 09:21.826
I just want you
to teach me how to spit.

Tripp's new jingle
for Blanca Toothpaste.

09:38.493 --> 09:40.993
You know, gotta help
a brother out, he needs me.

09:41.060 --> 09:43.493
And people say I have an ego.

09:45.926 --> 09:47.726
Look, co‐come over here,
give me a little blues‐‐

09:47.793 --> 09:50.060
I‐I know the blues, alright,
here you go, here you go.

09:50.126 --> 09:51.060
Alright.

09:52.493 --> 09:54.760
♪ My teeth are so nasty ♪

09:54.826 --> 09:57.860
♪ Like a pigeon's
in my mouth ♪

09:57.926 --> 09:59.626
♪ If I don't get
some Blanca soon ♪

09:59.693 --> 10:02.166

down south ♪

10:11.533 --> 10:14.700
Nice try,
blue sisters.

10:14.766 --> 10:15.866
But the Blanca people
are looking for

10:15.933 --> 10:18.200
something a little
more conservative.

10:18.266 --> 10:19.533
You're just threatened
by my skills.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.000
No, your skills are cool.

10:21.066 --> 10:22.066
It's that big head of yours

10:22.133 --> 10:23.566
that's making the room
feel crowded.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.100
Hey, pretty lady.
What's up, girl?

10:30.166 --> 10:31.733
Alright now.
What's up, man?

10:31.800 --> 10:33.200
Nothing much, j‐dog.

10:33.266 --> 10:36.266
Oh, oh, yeah, oh.
Oh, okay.

Oh, yeah, yeah. Show you, right.
Show you, right.

I think it's amazing
that you been able to

11:21.473 --> 11:22.973

11:23.040 --> 11:26.740
What? You been hiding
your 5 o'clock shadow for years.

11:28.940 --> 11:30.306
I mean, I know you could
fool some people.

11:30.373 --> 11:33.140
But what happens when you run
into somebody who knows you?

11:33.206 --> 11:34.406
Watch and learn.

11:34.473 --> 11:36.206
‐ Sit down, mama.
‐ Right, right, right, right.

11:36.273 --> 11:39.140
Yo, Tripp,

11:39.206 --> 11:40.706
Yeah, oh, I'm ready to go, dog.

11:42.973 --> 11:43.940
Who's your man?

11:44.006 --> 11:46.040
Oh, that's Jimmy, the powerful.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.073
Man, what's up? Tripp.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.706
What's up, strong black man?

11:48.773 --> 11:49.806

Keep it strong.

Right, keeping it real,

So, you gonna go

Oh, most definitely, dog,

Oh, yo, after we hit a few games
you know what we should do?

12:00.880 --> 12:03.080
We should go mack us a few honey
dips, you know what I'm saying?

12:03.146 --> 12:05.113
Cause, you know, the ladies

12:17.413 --> 12:19.513
Mack and honey dips?

12:19.580 --> 12:22.246
Baby, you're a man,
not a gigolo. Let's go.

12:22.313 --> 12:24.546

you know what I'm saying?

12:27.013 --> 12:29.946
[audience laughing]

12:37.480 --> 12:41.413
I don't know how much longer
this affair can go on, Stanley.

12:41.480 --> 12:43.880
I think my husband's onto us.

12:43.946 --> 12:46.413
Trust me, my flower,
he'll never find us here.

12:46.480 --> 12:49.813
I've taken every...precaution.

Caught you.
And I recommend a veal, yo.

We're going to take

Now, there's wine and crackers

Phil, dear colleague, you know,
there's something about

13:24.586 --> 13:27.786
that Jimmy that makes me
very uncomfortable.

13:27.853 --> 13:29.220
He's upstaging you.

13:29.286 --> 13:30.553
That could be it.

13:32.620 --> 13:36.720
Oh, Jimmy, your last ad‐lib
was brilliant.

13:36.786 --> 13:38.520
Oh, man, you know,
just trying to bring

13:38.586 --> 13:40.820
a little something, something
to the table, you know, dog.

Hone your craft, young man

13:45.620 --> 13:48.320

will only take you so far.

13:48.386 --> 13:50.320
Tragically, I know.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.020
Oh, yeah, my people.
Iron body.

13:55.086 --> 13:56.320
Oh, Marco, won't you meet
my people.

13:56.386 --> 13:57.953
That's Khadijah,
that there's Max.

13:58.020 --> 13:59.620
And this here's my..

13:59.686 --> 14:02.393
...roommate, Buddy, Buddy Jones.

14:03.560 --> 14:06.026
Buddy? Buddy?

14:06.093 --> 14:07.060
Mark McCulloch.

14:07.126 --> 14:09.126
Perhaps you recognize me
from my star turn

14:09.193 --> 14:10.860
in the critically
acclaimed film

14:10.926 --> 14:13.526
"Goodbye, Marvin Howard.
We Loved Your Pet Pig."

14:15.360 --> 14:16.626
Which one were you?

14:18.360 --> 14:20.993
Wait a minute.
I know you.

14:21.060 --> 14:24.126
You were in Uncle Zebadiah's
fish hut commercial.

14:24.193 --> 14:26.126
You get hit in the head
with the tackle box

14:26.193 --> 14:27.660
and fall over the boat.

14:27.726 --> 14:28.893
That was funny.

14:28.960 --> 14:31.360
Yeah, I was legally dead
for two minutes.

14:31.426 --> 14:34.026
We're, uh, we're meeting
after the show for drinks.

14:34.093 --> 14:35.360
Significant others are welcome.

14:35.426 --> 14:38.460
I assume one of these
attractive ladies is with you.

14:38.526 --> 14:40.960
Uh, nah, nah.
I ain't seeing nobody.

14:41.026 --> 14:42.760
The night's still young, honey.

14:48.726 --> 14:51.193
Guess we better get back
to our seats.

14:51.260 --> 14:53.193
‐ Go and get your Mack on.
‐ Go.

14:54.093 --> 14:56.026
[laughing]

14:58.493 --> 15:00.633
Baby, that little girl
just tried to roll up on you.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.866
I know.

15:02.933 --> 15:05.800
I created some kind of
Mack daddy monster, huh?

15:07.700 --> 15:09.100
A prediction.

15:09.166 --> 15:11.233
And I'm usually
right about these things.

15:11.300 --> 15:14.100
James Overton has
a long career ahead of him.

15:14.166 --> 15:16.300
Uh, exactly how long?

15:16.366 --> 15:19.033
Oh, 20, 30 years, easy.

15:20.166 --> 15:21.566
And I hope
I'm not assuming anything

15:21.633 --> 15:24.966
but when James gets his
lifetime achievement award

15:25.033 --> 15:26.833
I know you'll be
right there by his side.

15:28.033 --> 15:32.466
Uh, uh, Phil, um,
Buddy's just my‐my roommate.

15:32.533 --> 15:33.833
Just my roommate.

15:33.900 --> 15:37.033
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:37.100 --> 15:39.533
I thought you were...more.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.366
In that case, Jimmy

15:46.433 --> 15:50.333
you should come over to my place
for...paella.

15:52.966 --> 15:55.233
Alright, Phil, sounds good.
Alright.

15:56.033 --> 15:57.000
Bye.

16:04.173 --> 16:06.006
Oh, Obie, I promise I'm just
gonna go over there to eat.

16:06.073 --> 16:08.673
You know how much
I love my paella.

16:08.740 --> 16:10.406
No, I ain't worried about that.

16:10.473 --> 16:12.340
It's just that
we've been hoping and praying

16:12.406 --> 16:13.806
for your big break for years.

16:13.873 --> 16:16.806
It'd just be nice if we could
enjoy it as husband and wife.

16:16.873 --> 16:19.140
Oh, we're still
husband and wife.

16:19.206 --> 16:23.273
Just in public will be pals
that hold hands.

16:23.340 --> 16:25.040
Sometimes.

16:25.106 --> 16:28.940
Yeah, for the next
20 or 30 years.

16:29.006 --> 16:32.206
Well, have a good show, Jimmy.

16:32.273 --> 16:34.940
‐ Oh, Obie..
‐ No, no, no. Remember?

‐ Terrific.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.079

17:14.146 --> 17:16.646
Fine.
Give it to the pretty boy.

and, Jimmy, you play the woman.

17:24.680 --> 17:28.046

but I'mma work it.

to tell me before the, um

Titanic went down?

17:51.813 --> 17:53.413
Oh, nothing really.

It's just that I'm in love
with another person.

17:56.013 --> 17:57.246
There, I've said it.

ain't it?

with another man.

The plot thickens!

Oh, my God!
You're a man!

18:40.420 --> 18:41.853
But, that's okay.

Oh. So that's why
I was attracted to him.

19:07.493 --> 19:09.260
Now tell me why was I?

That's right, folks.
I'm all woman.

20:07.100 --> 20:09.533
when it was a jingle
for minty toothpaste.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.866
‐ 'Hmm?'
‐ They, they ripped me off.

20:14.433 --> 20:16.866
Damn, why can't I write this
stupid jingle?

20:16.933 --> 20:18.366
Look, stop whining.

20:18.433 --> 20:20.500
I mean, I'm the one that could
be hawking toothpaste

20:20.566 --> 20:23.500
for 50 years and never blow up
as a serious song writer.

20:23.566 --> 20:26.033
You know, you remember that
slow jam "Missing out on you?"

20:26.100 --> 20:27.633
Yeah, yeah.
That was the joint for a minute.

20:27.700 --> 20:28.800
I wrote it.

20:28.866 --> 20:30.166
‐ What?
‐ Yeah. Yeah.

20:30.233 --> 20:33.033
But I was so naive that I let
this producer steal it from me.

20:33.100 --> 20:36.766
The first time I heard it
on a radio, I was, I was pumped.

20:36.833 --> 20:39.866
The second time,
I put my foot through the radio.

20:39.933 --> 20:41.233
I wouldn't have stopped
till I put my foot

20:41.300 --> 20:42.900
through that producer's head.

20:44.733 --> 20:46.366
Well, I guess
I can accept being good

20:46.433 --> 20:48.600
at everything in the world
except this.

20:48.666 --> 20:49.900
Well, you weren't exactly
Stevie Wonder

20:49.966 --> 20:51.233
on the keyboard either.

20:52.166 --> 20:53.833
Go to sleep, Tripp.

20:53.900 --> 20:55.733
Check it. You, you still
need a headline

20:55.800 --> 20:57.133
for your, your Harlem story,
right?

20:57.200 --> 20:59.606
‐ Yeah.
‐ Alright.

20:59.673 --> 21:02.373
"Streets of gold,
flourishing trade.

21:02.440 --> 21:05.406
A cultural treasure chest.
Welcome to Utopia."

21:05.473 --> 21:07.306
Harlem, 2000.

21:07.373 --> 21:09.106
‐ 'Huh? Huh?'
‐ Hmm.

21:09.173 --> 21:11.606
Eh, well, my job
ain't in jeopardy.

21:15.106 --> 21:16.873
Well, I gave it a shot.

21:16.940 --> 21:18.873
‐ Goodnight.
‐ Alright.

21:21.073 --> 21:24.006
Streets of gold,
flourishing..

21:25.973 --> 21:28.740
Oh, forget this.
I like my song.
