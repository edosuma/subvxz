00:30.297 --> 00:32.031
Run.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.698
Run.

01:17.178 --> 01:21.080
¶ Hold you here
  inside my heart ¶

01:21.082 --> 01:24.349
¶ In walls of steel and stone ¶

01:24.351 --> 01:32.191
¶ I, and I alone must bear
 the relics of your love ¶

01:33.627 --> 01:41.533
¶ In the shadow of the mountain,
  a lonely hero stands ¶

01:41.836 --> 01:45.370
¶ Memories flood the land ¶

01:46.474 --> 01:47.706
Oi!

01:48.375 --> 01:50.742
Gap-Tooth, Fatso,
   knock it off!

01:52.313 --> 01:56.548
¶ I am falling,
   I am overcome ¶

02:12.299 --> 02:16.135
¶ I remember days of glory ¶

02:16.137 --> 02:18.704
¶ Silver at your feet ¶

02:18.706 --> 02:26.211
¶ The people lined the streets
 to see your victory parade ¶

02:28.782 --> 02:33.152
¶ In this age
  of toil and reason ¶

02:33.154 --> 02:36.188
¶ Hearts are crying out ¶

02:36.190 --> 02:43.729
¶ Do you hear the sound
above the static in your head? ¶

02:44.465 --> 02:46.431
¶ I am breathless ¶

02:46.433 --> 02:47.199
Hey!

02:47.201 --> 02:48.867
Oi! Knock it off, you two.

02:48.869 --> 02:51.870
Oh, my God!
   Oh, my God.

02:53.307 --> 02:55.574
- You never answered.
    -Ooh.

02:55.576 --> 02:59.611
Boston. Yeah,
  I like the Red Sox.

02:59.914 --> 03:03.415
- You hate baseball.
  -I love baseball.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.417
- You should pick Montana.
   -Montana?

03:05.419 --> 03:07.186
Yeah, they got
  mountains there.

03:07.188 --> 03:09.254
All right,
  I'll think about it.

03:41.388 --> 03:45.524
So, Bledsoe is in the 800.
   Let's have him.

03:45.526 --> 03:47.893
- Yes, sir.
   -Let me run it.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.330
- And you are?
  -Gap-Tooth, sir.

03:51.332 --> 03:54.933
- And who am I?
 -Coach Jared, sir.

04:04.311 --> 04:05.978
- Huh.
  -There they are.

04:05.980 --> 04:08.680
- Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.
   -Hey, Dad.

04:08.849 --> 04:09.948
Hey, Bobby.

04:09.950 --> 04:10.782
You guys want some coffee?

04:10.784 --> 04:13.652
No, no, Coach said chemicals
 are no good for runners.

04:13.654 --> 04:14.920
Oh, okay.

04:17.558 --> 04:18.957
Pass it over.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.729
It's the boys in blue.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.533
You smoke that like a bitch.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.536
- You do, actually--
   -Shut up, homo.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.038
Exceptional vocabulary, Bledsoe.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.340
I want this moron
 to repeat what he just said.

04:35.342 --> 04:37.342
- What did you say?
 -Whoa, whoa, whoa, "Moron."

04:37.344 --> 04:39.311
Let's everyone relax
  with the language.

04:39.313 --> 04:41.413
The correct term is homosexual.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.350
Sickle is a homosexual.

04:46.453 --> 04:49.421
Schuler is also a homosexual.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.857
- And proud of it.
   -Very proud.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.693
Come on, babe.

04:56.463 --> 04:57.696
Oi.

05:02.369 --> 05:03.935
- Coach.

05:11.445 --> 05:14.012
- You can forget
  about that, mister.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.315
Come on. Come on,
  let me run the 800.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.550
Whoa. That's...
   That's my race.

05:18.552 --> 05:21.486
I'll sprint out and hold them.
Bledsoe won't know what hit him.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.955
Bledsoe is a tool,
  but you can't beat him.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.857
He ran a 4:10 mile
  last year, man--

05:25.859 --> 05:28.093
A half is too short for him.

05:28.095 --> 05:32.698
Got it from the guy over there.
 It's yours if you let me run.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.634
- Take it, take it...
   -Okay. Deal.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.337
You may not want to be
 waving a joint around, man.

05:38.339 --> 05:41.373
Your spikes.
 Come on, switch out. Come on,
 we're the same size. Come on.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.442
Coach is going
   to be pissed
  if you don't win.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.443
Shut up!
  I am going to win!

05:44.445 --> 05:45.544
- Kevin, stop.
  -I'll be watching you.

05:45.546 --> 05:49.581
I hate Bledsoe. I'm gonna win.
 I am going to kick his ass.
   I am going to.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.016
All right.

05:51.919 --> 05:54.453
Runners, take your mark.

05:55.889 --> 05:56.888
Set.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.724
--Hit it!

06:00.461 --> 06:02.594
- Go, Kevin!
  -Come on, Kevin!

06:02.596 --> 06:04.896
Who is the coach
  of this team, damn it?

06:04.898 --> 06:06.498
You are, sir.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.867
Bobby's about
  to take the lead, sir.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.402
He can't run that fast.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.003
- Look at him go.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.739
- Go, Kevin!
-   -Go, Kevin!

06:13.741 --> 06:14.973
Come on, boy, run!

06:15.509 --> 06:19.010
We have a new record.
 Kevin Schuler, Cotton High.

06:20.748 --> 06:23.115
- Ride with me.
  -I promised my mom.

06:23.117 --> 06:26.451
Come on, sweetheart,
  let's get you home.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.158
Hey, leave your phone on.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.827
- Leave your phone on.
   -Yes, ma'am.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.830
Here's your hat. Bye.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.910
Did you tell my daughter
  you love her yet?

06:59.153 --> 07:00.719
Hey!

07:01.121 --> 07:02.554
Montana!

07:06.660 --> 07:10.128
So, how do you guys feel
  about having your son
  as a new record holder?

07:10.130 --> 07:13.632
- Best run you've ever had.
-   -Thank you.

07:13.967 --> 07:17.035
Bet you can't pass them
  before the bridge.

07:17.037 --> 07:17.836
All right.

08:24.571 --> 08:27.205
¶ ¶

09:04.278 --> 09:08.580
¶ ¶

09:54.895 --> 09:58.263
- Uh-oh.
  -It's supposed to hurt.

10:03.637 --> 10:07.005
Come on. Come on,
  let me run the 800.

10:15.382 --> 10:17.115
Run.

10:19.886 --> 10:21.920
Ride with me.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.925
My daughter likes you.

10:28.996 --> 10:31.029
What do you want with her?

10:33.100 --> 10:35.233
Well, make a choice.

11:32.259 --> 11:36.061
Hello. Bobby has
  a message for you.

11:36.063 --> 11:39.064
Aw! That's what
 you're missing, you jerk!

11:43.470 --> 11:48.306
I wish you were with me.
  I wish you didn't drive
  with your parents.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.142
Montana.

11:51.144 --> 11:55.246
Mountains. I'll find
 the perfect home for us.

11:55.415 --> 11:56.981
You'll see.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.849
¶ There's no rest ¶

12:30.851 --> 12:34.519
¶ For the wicked heart ¶

12:36.123 --> 12:42.093
¶ When the wicked lie ¶

12:43.063 --> 12:45.396
¶ Unfolds ¶

12:49.069 --> 12:56.274
¶ And bitterness
  of a lover's art ¶

12:57.944 --> 13:04.282
¶ Turning silver lies ¶

13:04.951 --> 13:07.318
¶ To gold ¶

13:10.457 --> 13:17.462
¶ Let fall the rain,
 let fall the rain down on you ¶

13:21.535 --> 13:29.073
¶ Let fall the rain,
 let fall the rain down on you ¶

13:38.351 --> 13:45.557
¶ Oh, what a test
  for the tender heart ¶

13:47.260 --> 13:53.565
¶ In the many nights ¶

13:54.100 --> 13:56.467
¶ Of love ¶

14:00.273 --> 14:07.111
¶ Oh, what a mess
  when it falls apart ¶

14:09.282 --> 14:15.920
¶ Where another lie ¶

14:15.922 --> 14:18.223
¶ Will grow ¶

14:21.895 --> 14:30.134
¶ Let fall the rain,
 let fall the rain down on you ¶

14:32.873 --> 14:37.242
¶ Let fall the rain,
 let fall the rain down on you ¶

14:37.244 --> 14:42.046
There are three students
  left from your grade.
  They're closing Carton.

14:42.048 --> 14:46.417
A number of schools have offered
 to accept you as a transfer.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.195
You think you ate enough
  for breakfast today?

15:00.100 --> 15:03.334
I'll make you something nice
  when you get home.

15:14.214 --> 15:19.350
That's fine, Mom.
 I'll give you the full report.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.014
Tight.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.687
Kevin Schuler.

15:56.089 --> 16:00.124
So, your transcript tells me
 that you're real bright.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.092
But let's face it.

16:01.094 --> 16:05.396
Carton is better known
  for its 4-H program
  than for academics.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.231
Well, we are very proud
   of our sheep.

16:07.233 --> 16:13.104
See, normally, I'd have
  to charge $2,000 for
 an out-of-district placement.

16:13.106 --> 16:16.107
But don't worry,
   I have an idea.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.309
Hey, send Coach K in.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.012
Coach.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.681
Thanks. Hydrate.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.717
So, Coach K tells me
  you're a runner.

16:25.719 --> 16:29.354
Oh, yeah. Kevin holds
 the Carton County record
   in the 800.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.589
- I didn't set any records.
    -Kevin.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.625
We can find scholarship money
  for a gifted athlete.

16:34.627 --> 16:37.595
I didn't set any records.
   And I'm too old.

16:37.597 --> 16:38.663
Ah, you're eligible
  until next summer.

16:38.665 --> 16:42.066
Yeah, I just want my credits
  and I want to graduate,
   that's it.

16:42.068 --> 16:43.001
You're gonna love this program.

16:43.003 --> 16:46.037
And you're gonna be so surprised
by the quality of our equipment.

16:46.039 --> 16:49.607
And for right now,
  we're just gonna forget
  about the tuition.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.776
Welcome aboard, son.

16:53.213 --> 16:57.281
Hey. You don't know
  anything about me.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.786
First practice
  is Monday at 3:00.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.489
Yeah, my man.

17:04.491 --> 17:07.692
- You run?
  -That's their plan.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.528
Distance runners are crazy.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.196
- Senior?
   -No, I'm 32.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.500
Oh, so you flunk what?
   14 years?

17:15.502 --> 17:18.336
They won't flunk me
 no matter how hard I try.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.204
They wanna win on Friday.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.571
Jol Brule.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.708
I'm up.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.310
Here we go.
 Everybody, let me see it.

17:26.311 --> 17:29.147
Let me see,
  let me see that frog.
    Ribbit!

17:29.282 --> 17:30.815
Ribbit! Ribbit!

17:30.817 --> 17:35.286
All right, here we go, guys.
  Get those hands up!

17:35.288 --> 17:38.356
Reaching high.
    Whoo!

17:38.358 --> 17:41.159
Feel what   it's like to be alive.
    Reaching high.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.727
You are not even breathing.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.829
Freeze,
   freeze, freeze.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.732
- I'm Henny.
    -Kevin.

17:47.801 --> 17:53.638
Yeah, I know. I know,
  Coach K told us about
 the new runners coming in.

17:54.140 --> 17:55.406
What's the matter with that guy?

17:55.408 --> 17:59.744
Oh, allegedly, he abandoned
  his family in Africa.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.613
You know, the secret police
   chased him out.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.282
Honestly, I just think
  he's from Kansas.

18:04.284 --> 18:09.821
- Down to the ground.
-  Let out a primal scream.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.390
All right, here we go.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.624
Weird.

18:13.726 --> 18:16.828
All right, on your feet there,
 homo sapiens. Gather around,

18:16.830 --> 18:20.698
gather round, my varsity team.
  How are you guys doing?

18:20.700 --> 18:21.299
Good.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.267
All right, listen,
   I am going
  to wake you up here.

18:23.269 --> 18:26.671
We're gonna do, uh,
  seven three-plus-ones.

18:26.673 --> 18:30.141
That's 300 meters,
  about five seconds
  above race pace.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.143
And then,
  100 meters cool-downs.

18:32.145 --> 18:35.313
Cool? Ready?
  On the line, let's go!

18:41.187 --> 18:43.754
Set.

18:44.390 --> 18:47.258
Let's go!
  Remember what fun is?

18:59.739 --> 19:01.806
Hey, Schuler, come here.

19:15.188 --> 19:18.256
Tough guy.
  Hold on, tough guy.

19:23.897 --> 19:25.596
Stick out your tongue.

19:26.199 --> 19:27.765
Out, out, so I can see it.

19:28.201 --> 19:29.433
Good.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.335
What are you...

19:35.542 --> 19:37.708
So you run a couple of miles,
 now your heartbeat's about 50,

19:37.710 --> 19:41.712
so, you've got the heart
 of a runner, but you're last
   in everything,

19:41.714 --> 19:43.781
so you're not even trying, huh?

19:44.350 --> 19:44.882
Well, maybe I suck.

19:44.884 --> 19:49.287
Nope. Nope. You're,
  you're a gazelle, man.
  You're a cheetah.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.588
You know,
  some of my students,
  they come out here

19:50.590 --> 19:52.423
because it's gonna look good
 on their resume, which is fine.

19:52.425 --> 19:58.362
Then I've got some students
 who should really take up golf
   or... bowling.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.398
Something they can drink beer
  while they're doing it

20:00.400 --> 20:03.267
'cause they are not going
 to amount to much as a runner.

20:03.269 --> 20:06.737
And then, every now and then...
   Nice pace.

20:07.974 --> 20:10.675
I get a runner who wants
  to dedicate themselves

20:10.677 --> 20:15.379
to the purest
and most natural sport there is.

20:15.381 --> 20:16.948
No bats, no balls, no pads.

20:16.950 --> 20:21.686
All you need for running
 is your heart... and your soul.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.588
The Greeks ran in the nude.
  Did you know that?

20:23.590 --> 20:25.723
- This is getting weird.
  -Children play tag.

20:25.725 --> 20:29.360
Horses race.
  Dogs run for fun.
  Everybody runs, man.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.729
They like it.
  But not you, huh?

20:31.731 --> 20:33.431
Maybe I hate running.

20:38.638 --> 20:39.837
No.

20:40.740 --> 20:41.973
Uh-uh.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.542
All right, warm down
  at your own pace, okay?

20:44.544 --> 20:47.712
And stay away from
  the rest of my runners.

20:49.415 --> 20:54.619
And the first race is
  on Friday, so you got
 that to look forward to.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.589
Good. Smiles are good.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.814
Ready? Set. Hut!

21:23.983 --> 21:27.485
You know distance runners
  are crazy, right?

21:27.487 --> 21:29.420
All right, let's go.

21:47.607 --> 21:48.973
Hey.

21:49.375 --> 21:50.908
What's in your head?

21:51.811 --> 21:52.410
Uh, commotion.

21:52.412 --> 21:56.647
That's cool.
 You got voices in your head.
  That's perfectly fine.

21:57.517 --> 21:58.983
Let me hear.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.921
No, I can't understand
   them either.

22:03.923 --> 22:07.825
As long as
  they're saying, "Win."

22:07.827 --> 22:09.760
'Cause that's what
  you're gonna do.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.062
Five-two-three!
   Five-two-three!

22:11.064 --> 22:13.631
- Relax.
   -One-two-three!
  -Fight!

22:13.633 --> 22:16.067
- Here comes the...
-   -Boom!

22:23.109 --> 22:25.609
¶ When the railroad tracks
   run out ¶

22:25.611 --> 22:28.646
¶ Where will you
  be goin', boy? ¶

22:28.648 --> 22:31.515
¶ Will you reach
 the edge of the woods? ¶

22:31.517 --> 22:36.620
¶ When the sheriff is around,
 you're nowhere to be found ¶

22:36.622 --> 22:41.058
¶ The fire in your legs,
  the wind in your face ¶

22:41.060 --> 22:46.464
¶ The echo in the trees,
the whisper through the leaves ¶

22:46.466 --> 22:48.699
¶ The dark horse is coming ¶

22:48.701 --> 22:52.503
¶ A lonely mother grieves ¶

23:08.855 --> 23:12.723
- Her name's...
-   -Get closer.

23:13.025 --> 23:16.827
Bock! Bock!

23:27.573 --> 23:31.642
¶ You never stand and face
 all the time you waste ¶

23:31.644 --> 23:32.610
Run.

23:32.612 --> 23:34.845
¶ Combing through
  the mountainside ¶

23:34.847 --> 23:36.714
¶ To find the edge of grace ¶

23:36.716 --> 23:43.053
¶ Just then a calm comes over,
 your heart feels sober ¶

23:43.055 --> 23:46.424
¶ You need a place to rest ¶

23:54.467 --> 23:56.000
Run.

24:28.568 --> 24:29.967
Stop.

24:45.785 --> 24:46.717
Still hate running?

24:46.719 --> 24:51.856
Son, that's 14:52.
  That is three seconds below   the track record.

24:51.858 --> 24:56.160
I knew you could do that.
You are a phenom, you know that.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.729
You are the game gorilla.

25:20.686 --> 25:23.654
- You're up early.
-   -Gotta run.

25:24.957 --> 25:27.591
- You need to eat more than that.
  -Don't want to barf.

25:27.593 --> 25:31.829
Kevin, it's ten miles.

25:35.668 --> 25:39.303
¶ Fields on fire,
   Marker 73 ¶

25:39.305 --> 25:40.804
- Hey, Mr. Sickle.
   -Hey, Kevin.

25:40.806 --> 25:45.175
¶ Twinkling lights, Iowa city ¶

25:45.177 --> 25:49.580
¶ I used to let the road
  get the best of me ¶

25:50.716 --> 25:52.917
¶ Something's changed
   inside of me ¶

25:52.919 --> 25:55.619
That's it.
 Relax those hip flexors.

25:55.621 --> 26:00.090
Can tuck and feel it.
   Nice and loose.

26:00.092 --> 26:01.825
Whoo.

26:04.764 --> 26:08.132
Hey!
  Can I run with you?

26:08.134 --> 26:09.700
Knock yourself out.

26:09.702 --> 26:12.336
It looks like   it's going to rain.
   Is it gonna rain?

26:12.338 --> 26:14.071
I don't know.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.140
Oh, I love thunderstorms.

26:16.142 --> 26:18.676
I'm reading "King Lear"
  right now, and, God,
  that scene when he's

26:18.678 --> 26:23.614
when he is walking
 through that thunderstorm,
  it's just incredible.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.750
He should have listened
   to Cordelia.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.264
Oh, my God.

26:41.901 --> 26:44.134
Why did you leave me out there?

26:44.370 --> 26:46.170
Because you couldn't keep up.

26:46.172 --> 26:49.773
I've never run
  that fast before.

26:51.043 --> 26:54.011
I'd race so much better
  if I trained with you.

26:54.013 --> 26:56.246
It's up to you.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.319
It's my birthday on Saturday.

27:03.856 --> 27:05.255
Congratulations.

27:05.725 --> 27:08.926
Well... I'm having a party.

27:10.129 --> 27:11.929
You're invited.

27:12.164 --> 27:15.132
Well, I can't come.
   I'm busy.

27:36.889 --> 27:40.891
The trainers here are crap.
 All they know is ice and tape.

27:41.827 --> 27:42.393
Can't you see someone?

27:42.395 --> 27:46.730
Some guys use a doctor down
 in Hibernia. That's insurance.

27:46.732 --> 27:48.832
My dad will find out.

27:49.669 --> 27:50.701
Let's go.

27:50.703 --> 27:54.138
I saw Phil Sickle
  at the hardware store
   the other day.

27:54.140 --> 28:00.778
He was talking about
 that crazy go-kart you and...
 Bobby built freshman year.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.281
Bobby was a great kid.

28:04.283 --> 28:07.084
Never had to worry
   about you two.

28:08.421 --> 28:12.089
You never talk about him.
   Or Ellie.

28:12.224 --> 28:14.792
- Why?
   -I don't know.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.796
"I don't know" is not an answer.

28:21.834 --> 28:25.269
Come on. We got
 three more stops to make.

28:36.082 --> 28:37.014
- Mrs. Schuler?
   -Have we met?

28:37.016 --> 28:42.186
No. Hi, I'm Henny Finch.
 I am here to interview Kevin
  for the school paper.

28:42.188 --> 28:43.287
- About what?
  -His... his running.

28:43.289 --> 28:48.859
I'm not gonna ask him anything
 about the accident, I mean,
 unless he wants to discuss it.

28:48.861 --> 28:52.229
He's... kind of a quiet guy.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.032
Well, he never used to be.

28:55.367 --> 28:58.969
Huh. Gary High
  is kind of a big place.

28:58.971 --> 29:00.804
It's gonna take some time.

29:02.174 --> 29:04.875
- How old are you?
    -18.

29:04.877 --> 29:06.343
18 going on what?

29:06.779 --> 29:10.047
- Come on in, honey.
  -Okay. Thank you.

29:11.050 --> 29:14.284
This lovely young woman
 is here to interview you.

29:14.286 --> 29:14.752
Hi.

29:14.754 --> 29:19.089
Well, I'll let you
  young people talk.
 I have to can preserves.

29:20.226 --> 29:21.859
Your mom's so cute.

29:21.861 --> 29:24.862
She buys these huge cans
 of Walmart blackberry jam,

29:24.864 --> 29:29.800
adds lemon juice and then
 puts them in bottled jars
  with her name on 'em.

29:29.835 --> 29:32.836
Well, that just makes me
  like her even more.

29:42.815 --> 29:46.016
I texted you the other day,
  and you didn't answer.

29:48.220 --> 29:53.857
The article. You know
   "Kevin Schuler,
  Champion Runner."

29:53.859 --> 29:56.126
And not, "Whose Friends Died."

29:56.262 --> 29:58.562
Oh, no, I wouldn't write that.

30:03.235 --> 30:06.003
- Are you any good?
 -Oh, yeah, I'm the best.

30:06.005 --> 30:09.840
- How much do I get paid?
  -It's a school paper.

30:09.842 --> 30:12.009
I should get something.

30:20.019 --> 30:22.586
- You need a photo too?

30:34.533 --> 30:37.868
- Do you have a blog?
    -What?

30:38.070 --> 30:39.536
Maybe you could write
   a whole series.

30:39.538 --> 30:40.904
Now you're just teasing me.

30:40.906 --> 30:44.208
Henny, would you
  like some crackers
  and blackberry jam?

30:44.210 --> 30:46.410
- Would you?
  -No! No, I'm okay.

30:46.412 --> 30:48.011
Thank you though.

30:48.013 --> 30:48.846
Um...

30:48.848 --> 30:53.150
Actually, I have to get home.
   I'm sorry.

30:54.253 --> 30:56.954
Thank you for coming out
   to the farm.

30:57.189 --> 30:58.856
What was that about?

30:59.225 --> 31:00.858
It's nothing.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.897
- Dad?
    -Coach

31:07.433 --> 31:09.066
I already ordered for you.

31:09.068 --> 31:11.335
How long has this
  been sitting here?

31:12.037 --> 31:14.638
- Well, she said...
   -Excuse me.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.573
I think it's a little cold.

31:19.245 --> 31:20.911
Kevin Schuler is a talent.

31:20.913 --> 31:25.382
I mean, the kind of talent
  that comes by once
   in a lifetime.

31:25.384 --> 31:30.487
A high school state champion.
 A college national champion.

31:30.489 --> 31:33.156
I want you to come on by
  and see him run.

31:33.158 --> 31:34.324
I want you to recruit him.

31:34.326 --> 31:38.028
I saw his time.
Let's see if he can do it again.

31:46.939 --> 31:50.641
- Relax the arms, Kevin.
-    Relax the arms.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.553
No, Kevin!

32:37.723 --> 32:42.592
Oh, come back.
 Come on. Whoo! Come back!

33:12.124 --> 33:15.559
- Hey, where's your sister?
 -In the barn.

33:39.718 --> 33:41.284
It's your birthday.

33:41.286 --> 33:45.789
- Yeah. It's my birthday.
-  -Happy birthday.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.626
What are you reading?

33:49.628 --> 33:52.295
I was reading Shakespeare.

33:53.699 --> 33:57.634
- I have to stop though.
-   -Why's that?

33:57.770 --> 34:01.104
Because Cordelia
  just breaks my heart.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.313
Run.

34:27.533 --> 34:29.099
Stop.

34:42.214 --> 34:43.447
One in a million.

34:43.449 --> 34:47.751
Well... Okay.
 Consider it a down payment.

34:48.353 --> 34:50.087
We got to protect him.

34:50.089 --> 34:52.322
I'm getting a lot
  of calls already.

34:52.324 --> 34:53.123
Yeah, well, you know what?

34:53.125 --> 34:56.326
Tell them that because
 of the accident, he needs
  to stay close to home

34:56.328 --> 35:00.464
to be near his parents. Okay?
They're not gonna question that.

35:00.466 --> 35:01.465
All right.

35:01.467 --> 35:02.199
Come here, come here.

35:02.201 --> 35:07.104
Listen, what's this?
 What's this? I need in here.
 Right there. Feel that groove?

35:07.106 --> 35:08.538
- Yeah.
  -Yeah, yeah, feel it.

35:10.175 --> 35:12.142
- That's it.
  -Hey, you're right.

35:12.144 --> 35:15.178
Look, another one
  for the homosexuals.

35:16.115 --> 35:17.514
Get out there.

35:38.537 --> 35:39.870
Down! Ten hut!

35:39.872 --> 35:42.906
Come on, Jol.
   Stay in bounds!
  Stay on your feet.

35:42.908 --> 35:45.709
You gotta run behind your pass.
Show me what you got on defense.

35:45.711 --> 35:49.279
Use your stiff arm!
   Get the ball
  and take it down field.

35:49.281 --> 35:53.283
Come on, get up
  off the ground, son!
 You can't play on the ground!

35:53.285 --> 35:54.918
Come on, now step up
   and be a man!

35:54.920 --> 35:55.785
- Yes, sir.
   -Keep it up!

35:55.787 --> 35:59.789
Look at these scouts over here.
They come out and don't see you?

35:59.791 --> 36:03.293
This is Kevin.
   He runs.
   My father.

36:03.295 --> 36:06.196
- You walking home.
-   -Yes, sir.

36:17.276 --> 36:18.575
What does State want exactly?

36:18.577 --> 36:21.678
Ah, they're gonna take a look
  at that body of yours.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.880
They'll pay you.
  That sounded wrong.

36:23.882 --> 36:26.183
- Yeah, that sounds illegal.
   -No. No, no.

36:26.185 --> 36:27.751
- Isn't it illegal?
  -It's medical research.

36:27.753 --> 36:28.752
Don't worry, Rosie
  is a good coach.

36:28.754 --> 36:33.557
Coach...
 Head Coach, Karen Rowan.
  It's Umber's daughter.

36:34.326 --> 36:37.194
And I'm pretty sure
  he wanted a son, so...

36:37.196 --> 36:41.698
But yeah, she's... she's good.
  She's got a good heart.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.400
You'll be...

36:44.937 --> 36:48.905
You'll run on a treadmill.
 Come on, that'll be fun.

37:02.554 --> 37:03.787
Damn it.

37:07.826 --> 37:10.527
Have you been wearing those
   all season?

37:10.529 --> 37:12.963
- Since spring.
    -What?

37:13.365 --> 37:15.632
Since spring.

37:15.634 --> 37:18.702
Doesn't Sam know enough
 to get you decent shoes?

37:27.246 --> 37:29.379
Take better care of my runner.

37:29.381 --> 37:31.014
Ah, well, he's not
  your runner yet.

37:31.016 --> 37:35.819
Don't try to wind me up
 like that. It doesn't even
   work anymore.

37:39.258 --> 37:43.426
Obviously,
 he is physically talented,
 but his running is all nerves.

37:43.428 --> 37:46.663
He runs every race
 like his life depends on it.

37:46.665 --> 37:47.564
You can't coach that.

37:47.566 --> 37:50.033
Well, did you read
   the printout?

37:51.270 --> 37:52.802
His VO2 is Olympic-caliber.

37:52.804 --> 37:59.276
His muscle response
   makes him ideal
  for the mile to 5K.

37:59.511 --> 38:01.811
Nobody can screw that up.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.615
Understood, Coach.

38:14.059 --> 38:16.293
You have to tell me
   if you're hurt.

38:16.295 --> 38:19.796
How am I going to know
  if you don't tell me?

38:22.000 --> 38:23.967
What were you two arguing about?

38:23.969 --> 38:25.468
Nothing.

38:25.470 --> 38:29.406
We just go back...
  Oh, come on, man!

38:31.076 --> 38:32.342
Oh.

38:32.344 --> 38:34.944
- I got you some new shoes.
 -No, no, no, I have shoes.

38:34.946 --> 38:36.613
- And now you have new shoes.
 -I don't want new shoes.

38:36.615 --> 38:41.751
Well, you're gonna get 'em.
 Homo sapiens were not meant
  to run on concrete.

38:41.753 --> 38:46.690
Look at the Kenyans.
 They run on dirt and grass
  every chance they get.

38:46.992 --> 38:49.793
You have to take care
   of your feet!

38:52.531 --> 38:54.931
You have to take care
   of yourself.

38:55.400 --> 38:59.035
I can't even put these on you.
 Let me get something else.

39:46.485 --> 39:49.719
Last year,
  you ran over 17 minutes
   on that course.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.888
How do you drop off
 a minute and a half, huh?

39:51.890 --> 39:54.624
What are you doing?
  You blood doping?

39:54.626 --> 39:55.625
Hit me.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.927
Come on, hit me!
  You'll feel better.

40:04.603 --> 40:06.870
Oh, is that all you got?

40:06.938 --> 40:08.571
I think you could do
  better than that.

40:08.573 --> 40:10.507
Do you know why?
  Why should I hit you?

40:10.509 --> 40:14.944
Your dad got you into running
 when you were what? Eight?

40:15.180 --> 40:20.483
He held you back a year
 in high school just so you'd
be the best runner in the state.

40:20.485 --> 40:26.423
You spent years eating,
  breathing and sleeping
    running.

40:26.992 --> 40:30.493
And they just kicked my ass
  back to high school.

40:30.495 --> 40:36.800
And here I am, just a nobody,
 ruining your daddy's plans.

40:36.802 --> 40:40.770
So, come on, hit me,
   chicken-shit!

40:40.772 --> 40:42.672
Hit me!

40:46.111 --> 40:47.710
You're crazy.

40:51.650 --> 40:53.016
Come on.

40:54.152 --> 40:55.985
Hit me...

42:18.870 --> 42:20.236
Hey.

42:21.006 --> 42:22.539
You hungry?

42:32.117 --> 42:37.186
Will you... let me
  follow you around
  for the article?

42:37.822 --> 42:40.990
Your running.
   Your life.
   You know?

42:49.067 --> 42:50.800
You're kind of inconsistent.

42:50.802 --> 42:54.671
Well, consistency
   is the hobgoblin
   of little minds.

42:54.839 --> 42:59.809
"Foolish consistency
  is the hobgoblin
  of little minds."

42:59.811 --> 43:05.315
You know, I just read Emerson
 in AP English and now you're
  quoting him back to me.

43:05.317 --> 43:07.817
Why do you take
 those jock classes, huh?

43:07.819 --> 43:08.985
Well, that's where
   Umber put me.

43:08.987 --> 43:11.187
"That's where Umber put you."
    Okay.

43:11.189 --> 43:16.326
God, sometimes,
   I just wanna...
   strangle you.

43:21.800 --> 43:24.834
We're reading
 "The Great Gatsby" this week.

43:25.270 --> 43:29.272
You know how he has his...
  I guess, schedule?

43:29.808 --> 43:32.842
His improvement exercises?

43:33.011 --> 43:35.778
You know,
   I think of you
  when I read that.

43:37.248 --> 43:42.385
You act so aloof,
 but you try harder than anyone.

43:47.025 --> 43:48.224
Why?

43:53.665 --> 43:55.231
There used to be
  an elm over there.

43:55.233 --> 44:01.304
You know, Bobby and I, we built
 a tree fort, but somebody,
  somebody cut it down.

44:08.947 --> 44:10.313
Bobby Sickle?

44:12.751 --> 44:17.654
B-S, you wrote...
 his initials on your shoes.

44:17.656 --> 44:19.155
They're his shoes.

44:21.126 --> 44:26.796
I'm sorry, I don't mean to...
  bring up bad memories.

44:27.265 --> 44:29.899
You know, when I read
 about the crash in the papers,

44:29.901 --> 44:33.836
I thought it was
  the most awful thing
   I'd ever...

45:01.032 --> 45:02.999
I wanna be good for you.

45:18.216 --> 45:20.950
- Where were you?
-   -I was out.

45:22.954 --> 45:28.758
I found the check
  from the university.
 $3,000 is a lot of money.

45:29.928 --> 45:32.495
I'm doing physiological testing
   for them.

45:32.497 --> 45:34.497
Are you allowed to do that?

45:34.499 --> 45:36.966
The coaches say that it's fine.

45:37.869 --> 45:40.403
Are they testing
  what you're thinking?

45:41.206 --> 45:45.475
No. 'Cause I'm not
 doing psychological testing.

45:45.477 --> 45:46.976
I am doing
  physiological testing--

45:46.978 --> 45:49.212
I know what the word means.

45:49.214 --> 45:53.316
Look. You're getting
  straight As in school.

45:53.318 --> 45:55.451
Your running is amazing.

45:55.453 --> 45:59.422
You just... You never bring
 any friends over anymore.

45:59.491 --> 46:00.790
Mom.

46:00.792 --> 46:01.858
I'm not going
  to dress in all black

46:01.860 --> 46:04.927
and bring dad's shotgun
  to school, if that's
  you're thinking--

46:04.929 --> 46:07.029
That's not what I meant.

46:07.132 --> 46:09.332
I just don't know
 what's going on anymore.

46:09.334 --> 46:12.368
That's because I don't
  want to talk to you.

46:16.407 --> 46:20.109
Or Dad. I don't want
  to talk to anyone.

46:22.046 --> 46:26.115
You know, the polite thing
  to do would be to write

46:26.117 --> 46:27.049
the university a thank-you note.

46:27.051 --> 46:31.120
I wrote the address
  and I put a stamp
   on it for you.

46:47.305 --> 46:48.838
--Yeah.

46:48.840 --> 46:50.273
--Come on.

46:50.275 --> 46:51.874
--Come on.

46:51.876 --> 46:53.376
--Come on.

46:54.245 --> 46:57.046
My old man's gotten worse
  since they fired him.

46:57.048 --> 46:59.949
Nothing to do,
  but bitch on my ass.

47:01.186 --> 47:04.086
- Ah, sorry.
-   -It's all good.

47:11.563 --> 47:13.129
Come on.

47:13.464 --> 47:14.530
One more.

47:14.532 --> 47:17.099
--Picture your dad.

47:24.409 --> 47:25.975
Read that to me.

47:29.180 --> 47:32.448
"Kevin Schuler
 reads scientific journals
  as well as Emerson

47:32.450 --> 47:36.519
and is a model of fitness
   and good looks."

47:37.355 --> 47:39.188
You could keep going, please.

47:39.190 --> 47:42.258
"He also admits
 to having shin splints...

47:43.494 --> 47:48.197
Tendinitis and
 gastrointestinal disturbances."

47:49.200 --> 47:49.899
This is stupid.

47:49.901 --> 47:54.136
Why do I have
  to read this here?
   Are you hurt?

47:54.906 --> 47:56.639
Well, it's supposed to hurt.

47:58.509 --> 48:01.577
Running is the highlight
   of my day.

48:01.613 --> 48:07.917
If I have a bad day,
 a good run saves it for me.

48:09.454 --> 48:10.953
What are you doing?

48:10.955 --> 48:16.425
There's good pain...
 and there's hurting yourself.

48:19.297 --> 48:21.464
Go home. Stay there.

48:22.400 --> 48:24.233
No running for two days.

48:24.235 --> 48:26.402
I don't wanna see you
   until Friday.

48:32.377 --> 48:36.545
Key on Kevin.
   And stay ready.
  This is a hilly course.

48:36.547 --> 48:39.015
All right, everybody else
  is gonna be gassed.

48:39.017 --> 48:42.919
And that last long hill,
  that's where we attack.

48:42.921 --> 48:43.920
That's where we win it.

48:43.922 --> 48:47.990
So, let's go on
  out there and get us
  a state championship!

48:47.992 --> 48:50.159
Give me a Gary on three.
  One, two, three!

48:50.161 --> 48:51.494
Gary!

48:51.496 --> 48:53.496
Five-two-three!
   Five-two-three!

48:53.498 --> 48:55.031
- One-two-three!
    -Fight!

48:55.033 --> 48:57.266
- Here comes the...
-   -Boom!

48:58.202 --> 48:59.635
You see the creek?

49:00.204 --> 49:03.406
I hear you are no good
  with rivers and such.

49:05.176 --> 49:06.709
Keep the team together.
   All right?

49:06.711 --> 49:09.545
Hey, help each other out.
 Get in here. Get in here.

49:09.547 --> 49:13.382
We can win this thing, okay?
 On three, give me a woo-hoo!

49:13.384 --> 49:16.285
- One, two, three!
-   -Woo-hoo!

49:16.287 --> 49:17.687
Yeah.

49:18.990 --> 49:20.523
Ready? Set!

49:38.242 --> 49:42.712
¶ Stay right here
  with the devil in you ¶

49:42.714 --> 49:46.349
¶ I can't let you loose ¶

49:46.351 --> 49:52.488
¶ Stare me down,
 let the devil in me tame you ¶

49:54.525 --> 49:58.561
¶ You will find
  what's lost in me ¶

49:58.563 --> 50:02.565
¶ No one has to know ¶

50:02.633 --> 50:09.038
¶ Lead me down,
 let the devil in me show ¶

50:38.136 --> 50:39.368
Ellie!

50:51.115 --> 50:52.248
Ellie! Ellie...

50:52.250 --> 50:55.751
Kevin, you're four minutes late.
 We had to leave without you.

50:55.753 --> 51:00.156
Oh, no, I'm here now.
  I'm here. I'm here.

51:02.293 --> 51:03.726
You can't come
   with us, Kevin?

51:03.728 --> 51:06.228
Let's get you home, sweetheart.

51:19.844 --> 51:23.612
- What was that?
 -I don't think anyone saw.

51:24.849 --> 51:30.686
¶ Lead me down,
 let the devil in me show ¶

52:09.594 --> 52:10.826
Ellie!

52:16.300 --> 52:18.601
Ellie...

52:24.909 --> 52:26.609
Run.

52:34.685 --> 52:36.452
Stop.

52:48.332 --> 52:49.565
Ellie.

52:50.468 --> 52:51.834
You're a state champion!

52:51.836 --> 52:54.170
- You nailed that sucker!
 -You're a state champion!

52:54.172 --> 52:56.705
- Your runner ran into our boy.
 -I'm sorry, it was accidental.

52:56.707 --> 53:01.644
The Athletic Association
 recommends disqualifying both
 runners for poor sportsmanship.

53:01.646 --> 53:03.579
Official Bledsoe,
  this is a big pack.

53:03.581 --> 53:05.447
You know, there's going
  to be some bumping.

53:05.449 --> 53:08.751
Come on,  you can't make that call.
  It's a state championship.

53:08.753 --> 53:10.686
Run the race ten times.
  Nobody would beat him.

53:10.688 --> 53:13.289
Do you have anything
  to say for yourself?

53:13.491 --> 53:15.324
I'm guilty.

53:15.326 --> 53:17.393
Halt, just a gosh damn minute!

53:17.395 --> 53:20.529
He doesn't know
  what he's saying.
  He can hardly breathe.

53:20.531 --> 53:21.197
Oh, shit.

53:21.199 --> 53:24.800
Come on.
  He's got no oxygen.
   Come on. Coach.

53:25.469 --> 53:28.704
Good job, son. Congratulations.

53:32.610 --> 53:35.377
- Why did you run him down?
  -'Cause he deserved it.

53:35.379 --> 53:37.680
That's the stupidest thing
  I've ever heard.

53:37.682 --> 53:41.984
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I mess up
 our package deal to State?

53:43.521 --> 53:45.454
What are you talking about?

53:45.456 --> 53:49.892
If I run for Rowan at State,
  you're hired, right?

53:49.894 --> 53:51.627
You think I don't figure
   this shit out?

53:51.629 --> 53:55.431
I don't really care about
 that, man. I just want you to
 be able to see what you have.

53:55.433 --> 53:59.902
There is a 100 runners out there
 who would kill for an ounce
   of your talent.

53:59.904 --> 54:01.937
Oh, that's great.
 That's great they're out there.

54:01.939 --> 54:04.807
Why don't you go find them,
 why don't you work it out
   with them?

54:04.809 --> 54:09.245
Okay, tell me
  what they decide.
   Here, take this.

54:11.415 --> 54:12.648
Take it.

54:24.028 --> 54:27.529
It's 20 miles.
   Get in the car.

54:27.531 --> 54:29.465
It's an easy 18.

54:29.600 --> 54:30.833
Oh...

55:13.444 --> 55:16.912
First, you ran the boy down.
 Then you bragged about it.

55:16.914 --> 55:23.085
That state championship
was yours and you threw it away.
  What were you thinking?

55:25.589 --> 55:27.956
You don't want
 to explain yourself, huh?

55:27.958 --> 55:31.960
Oh, ho! You don't
 have to explain yourself
  to your teammates,

55:31.962 --> 55:34.029
why you lost them
 the state championship, huh?

55:34.031 --> 55:40.502
You don't have to explain
 yourself to Coach Rowan why her
 star recruit was disqualified?

55:45.109 --> 55:46.942
You are not a wild animal
   in the woods!

55:46.944 --> 55:51.647
Do you care about anybody?
 Do you care about anything?

55:55.686 --> 55:59.888
This silent treatment
 is not real original, Kevin.

56:01.926 --> 56:06.695
I've decided that Coach K
  can't handle you.

56:06.697 --> 56:08.764
I'm gonna be your coach
   from now on.

56:08.766 --> 56:12.000
- You can't fire Coach K.
 -I am principal of this school.

56:12.002 --> 56:17.373
I'm the head coach.
 I can do what I gosh damn want.

56:17.742 --> 56:20.142
I won't run for anyone else.

56:20.945 --> 56:22.711
I'll quit the team.

57:05.022 --> 57:09.558
You leave a spot on that,
 I will come back to haunt you.

57:13.664 --> 57:15.431
So why are you here, man?

57:17.735 --> 57:19.201
'Cause I blew it.

57:20.504 --> 57:23.439
Umber wanted to fire you
   because of me.

57:23.474 --> 57:25.774
Ooh. Really?

57:25.976 --> 57:30.546
All he told me was that...
  you were stubborn.

57:31.449 --> 57:31.947
And I was like,

57:31.949 --> 57:37.119
"A stubborn Kevin Schuler,
 that's not somebody I know,
  Principal Umber."

57:37.121 --> 57:39.755
Yeah.

57:42.560 --> 57:45.127
You want to tell me
 what happened out there?

57:45.863 --> 57:48.831
Uh... I let you down.

57:52.636 --> 57:54.803
Well, young man.

57:54.872 --> 57:56.939
It was an impressive screw up.

57:56.941 --> 58:02.177
Next time, why don't you just
 tell me about it before you
  do something like that?

58:03.080 --> 58:06.982
Coach, I want to run faster.

58:07.585 --> 58:09.218
I want to beat everyone.

58:20.898 --> 58:23.565
And I'm not running
  for anybody else.

58:27.638 --> 58:28.871
Okay.

58:38.148 --> 58:40.816
- Who is she?
    -Okay.

58:40.818 --> 58:43.085
That is the, ah, only woman

58:43.087 --> 58:48.123
who was nuts enough
  to almost... marry me.

58:48.125 --> 58:49.992
And she was a runner.

58:50.628 --> 58:54.763
Together, we went up
  to Boundary Waters,
 pitched a tent on an island.

58:54.765 --> 58:58.767
Spent the summer running around
 like a bunch of naked hippies.

59:01.639 --> 59:03.272
So, what happened to her?

59:03.974 --> 59:04.706
You know...

59:04.708 --> 59:08.176
We spent all our time together.
 We were training together.
  We were living on love.

59:08.178 --> 59:14.249
I didn't need anymore than that.
 All the stuff I could fit into
 a backpack was good for me.

59:14.251 --> 59:16.618
And, two weeks
  before our wedding,

59:16.620 --> 59:21.023
she ran off with a rich guy
  and called me a loser.

59:25.563 --> 59:27.129
Which I was!

59:31.035 --> 59:32.768
Her marriage only lasted a year.

59:32.770 --> 59:36.038
I kind of count that
  as a consolation prize.

59:37.908 --> 59:42.611
And then she got
  a job coaching at Gary.

59:43.847 --> 59:46.214
I'm gonna make us
  some more burgers.

59:47.184 --> 59:48.650
At Gary?

59:59.263 --> 01:00:00.996
That's Coach Rowan.

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:02.164
What?

01:00:02.166 --> 01:00:09.104
And by the time I got back,
 she had moved on to State
 and she got me the job at Gary.

01:00:13.811 --> 01:00:16.278
What do all those counselors
   tell you?

01:00:18.082 --> 01:00:19.214
That's a nice segue, Coach.

01:00:19.216 --> 01:00:20.315
I read the file.
  What did they tell you?

01:00:20.317 --> 01:00:24.353
They said that I'm fine,
   that I'm normal
  and I'm average.

01:00:24.355 --> 01:00:28.290
- They were full of shit.
  -Pretty much.

01:00:29.193 --> 01:00:34.329
So, I run.
  Because like you said,
 running saves a bad day.

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.899
You get a lot of bad days?

01:00:55.919 --> 01:00:56.318
Hey.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:02.224
This great man, he once
 said that most people die
 with their music still in them.

01:01:02.226 --> 01:01:07.229
And you got a whole
  orchestra inside you.

01:01:07.231 --> 01:01:09.698
If you really want to run...

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:16.238
Tim Danielson and Marty Liquori,
  3:59. Jim Ryun, 3:55,
  Alan Webb, 3:53.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.240
That's your competition.

01:01:18.242 --> 01:01:22.310
And they didn't spike somebody
  because they were mad.

01:01:22.312 --> 01:01:24.146
They were focused.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:32.054
You go easy... this week.

01:01:33.957 --> 01:01:36.892
And then, we will talk.

01:01:40.998 --> 01:01:46.001
I can't believe
 that you actually asked me out.

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:52.040
Well, I wanted to show you
 the beautiful downtown Carton.

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:52.274
Mm.

01:01:52.276 --> 01:01:56.478
Here we have the...
 We have the post office.

01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:02.484
There's a hardware store and...
 And this is just the best
  ice cream in town.

01:02:02.486 --> 01:02:05.320
Actually,
it's the only ice cream in town.

01:02:08.792 --> 01:02:10.859
I'm starved all the time.

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.794
Oh, here, take mine.

01:02:12.796 --> 01:02:14.896
- No, that's okay.
 -You can have it, really.

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:16.298
I don't want it.

01:02:20.137 --> 01:02:22.370
- Wow.

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:25.807
Your singing, it's, uh...

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:28.110
Your, uh...

01:02:28.112 --> 01:02:29.511
It's good.

01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:33.148
What is that? Is that like
 some kind of jock thing?

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:37.119
I always see basketball players
   do it and stuff.

01:02:38.021 --> 01:02:38.987
And track stars.

01:02:38.989 --> 01:02:40.122
Right, yes, and track stars.

01:02:40.124 --> 01:02:44.526
No, it's like, uh...
 it's like it's from the heart.

01:02:44.795 --> 01:02:48.163
Or... "I have heart."

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:48.997
"I have heart."

01:02:48.999 --> 01:02:53.935
So what, you don't
  have to be a jock
  or anything to do it?

01:02:54.071 --> 01:02:56.505
No. Rich, white girls
   could do it too.

01:02:56.507 --> 01:02:59.508
Oh, really? Okay.
 So you give me permission?

01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:01.843
Oh, yeah.
  You knock yourself out.

01:03:01.845 --> 01:03:05.180
Okay...
   All right.

01:03:08.552 --> 01:03:09.951
Yo!

01:03:10.888 --> 01:03:11.353
Scored with Henny.

01:03:11.355 --> 01:03:16.858
Been there, done that.
  Don't phone or nothin',
  just call me a rat.

01:03:20.097 --> 01:03:21.429
Look, I...

01:03:22.533 --> 01:03:24.099
I'm sorry.

01:03:25.335 --> 01:03:26.802
Yeah.

01:03:27.104 --> 01:03:27.502
You should be.

01:03:27.504 --> 01:03:30.906
And that's actually
  why I asked you out.

01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:33.475
Oh, so this is an apology date?

01:03:34.411 --> 01:03:36.545
Look, I'm sorry.

01:03:38.916 --> 01:03:41.049
I really love your singing.

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:44.553
Oh, so now compliments? Wow!

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:51.126
- You mean it?
    -Really.

01:03:52.896 --> 01:03:54.296
Really, really.

01:03:58.602 --> 01:04:01.403
You know,
  I forget everything
  when I am singing.

01:04:01.405 --> 01:04:04.539
You're probably the same way
 with your running, right?

01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:07.609
- It's my own world.
 -Yeah, you're so disciplined.

01:04:07.611 --> 01:04:10.212
- I'm not disciplined.
- Oh yeah, you're always running.

01:04:10.214 --> 01:04:13.582
It's not...
  It's not discipline.

01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:17.552
I run because... I have to.

01:04:18.121 --> 01:04:21.089
I feel something when I run.
  It's like breathing.

01:04:21.091 --> 01:04:23.959
So I have to run,
  every single day.

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:28.496
That's kind of nuts.

01:04:29.967 --> 01:04:32.267
Yeah. Maybe.

01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:55.257
Um, do you want
  to see the hair salon?

01:05:06.336 --> 01:05:07.002
Full ride.

01:05:07.004 --> 01:05:12.073
My old man's so happy
  he's already bought
 a bunch of bulldog hats.

01:05:13.577 --> 01:05:15.143
How do you feel?

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.146
Weird.

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:20.548
You know,
 I should feel great, right?

01:05:21.285 --> 01:05:26.321
Play some ball.
  Job. It's all real now.

01:05:27.124 --> 01:05:29.557
My knee's worse.

01:05:30.694 --> 01:05:32.560
If they find out about it...

01:05:32.963 --> 01:05:37.198
Like if they find out
 about the shit that goes
  on in my head...

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:40.068
Praise Jesus, you're
 more screwed up than I am.

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:47.375
- About frickin' time.
  -Seriously. Okay.

01:05:47.377 --> 01:05:48.343
Hi.

01:05:48.345 --> 01:05:49.244
- Coach.
    -Coach.

01:05:49.246 --> 01:05:51.146
- Where do you wanna...
   -Yeah, here.

01:05:51.148 --> 01:05:53.515
Okay. Come.
  I'll bring this.

01:05:53.517 --> 01:05:57.185
- Do you want a coffee?
   -Uh... No.

01:05:57.187 --> 01:06:02.057
Well, here is Kevin's
 spring training schedule.

01:06:02.059 --> 01:06:03.224
Okay.

01:06:03.226 --> 01:06:09.531
Huh. Two race days, one tempo.
 This is a... state workout.

01:06:09.533 --> 01:06:12.167
Well, the consistency
 is going to be good for him.

01:06:12.169 --> 01:06:15.437
Well, I need to see
  how he feels each day.

01:06:15.439 --> 01:06:18.606
You let him do
  whatever he wants.

01:06:18.976 --> 01:06:20.575
I don't coach like this.

01:06:20.577 --> 01:06:25.080
All right, well,
  you were never one
  for long-term plans.

01:06:27.684 --> 01:06:32.620
Coach, I am getting
   a lot of calls
  from other schools.

01:06:32.622 --> 01:06:35.523
You've seen the offers.
 He can go anywhere he wants.

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:37.192
Are you serious?

01:06:37.194 --> 01:06:40.495
What, are you going
to drive him to the airport too?

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:44.632
How long have we waited
 for an athlete like this?

01:06:44.735 --> 01:06:46.634
He's not going anywhere.

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:49.004
Coach.

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:52.407
He'll listen to you.

01:06:56.446 --> 01:06:58.346
Hmm...

01:07:11.428 --> 01:07:12.794
Wow!

01:07:12.796 --> 01:07:14.362
- Hey.
-   -Hey.

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:15.764
Hi! How are you,
   Mrs. Schuler?

01:07:15.766 --> 01:07:19.300
Hi. Good. How are you?
   It's beautiful.

01:07:19.302 --> 01:07:20.068
It's a bribe.

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:23.772
Well...
  Okay. You know, uh...

01:07:23.774 --> 01:07:26.808
- Is this even legal?
  -Uh, apparently, it is.

01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:30.678
Because of the... stuff
 you're doing at the university,
    I guess.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:35.316
So, I know, you know,
  you can get it to use it
 to go to and from school.

01:07:35.318 --> 01:07:36.551
Probably make things
  a little bit easier.

01:07:36.553 --> 01:07:39.654
Yeah, you run everywhere
  if I don't drive you.
   It's not safe.

01:07:39.656 --> 01:07:42.791
I've been telling you
   to get a car.

01:07:43.126 --> 01:07:45.360
So... you're the delivery boy?

01:07:45.362 --> 01:07:48.329
- Don't talk like that, Kevin.
  -No. No, no, it's okay.

01:07:48.331 --> 01:07:52.233
Yes. Yes, I am.
  That's my job tonight.

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:53.601
Delivery boy.

01:07:54.271 --> 01:07:56.438
Well, do you agree with this?

01:07:57.174 --> 01:07:59.207
--Do you?

01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:01.142
Nope.

01:08:01.144 --> 01:08:02.410
Have a good night.

01:08:04.081 --> 01:08:06.214
I'll see you at practice, okay?

01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:07.082
Yeah.

01:08:07.084 --> 01:08:09.818
- Good night, Mrs. Schuler.
-  -Good night.

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:11.553
Gosh.

01:08:13.223 --> 01:08:15.623
I want to take
  this thing racing.

01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:27.402
Here, could you
 take this up to the door?
  It's for the church.

01:08:31.108 --> 01:08:32.407
Thank you.

01:08:39.716 --> 01:08:42.617
--Whoo!

01:08:46.356 --> 01:08:47.788
- Hi!
    -Hi.

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:50.191
Where's your cute mom?

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:53.528
Uh... She left.

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:55.296
Oh, bummer.

01:08:56.233 --> 01:08:57.332
Come in, come in.

01:08:57.334 --> 01:08:58.832
- Oh, you know, I'm...
   -No, no, no.

01:08:58.835 --> 01:09:03.304
- You know, I gotta...
- Hey. Kevin. Come in. Seriously.

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:03.837
- Okay
   -Thank you.

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:08.510
So, this is the kitchen.
 You can place your stuff
  right here if you want.

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:11.813
Just put it right here.
   Green punch.
   Hey, what's up?

01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:14.182
All right. Rye.

01:09:14.184 --> 01:09:17.618
Um, drinks.
   Do you want any?
   You know?

01:09:17.621 --> 01:09:18.486
Oh, cool, cool.

01:09:18.488 --> 01:09:22.890
Make up some concoctions,
 whatever. Hey. How are you?

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:24.725
Um...

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:27.162
So, pool.

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:30.365
- Wow.
  -It's heated. Yeah.

01:09:30.767 --> 01:09:31.799
Hey, guys.

01:09:31.801 --> 01:09:34.335
What's up?
 Jol's somewhere, I think.

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:34.736
Oh, yeah?

01:09:34.738 --> 01:09:39.174
Hey!
 Now the party's started!

01:09:39.176 --> 01:09:40.274
Kevin!

01:09:40.277 --> 01:09:44.645
- I... I don't... I don't drink.
  -Oh. You pregnant?

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:48.249
"I don't drink."
 Man, shut up and come on.

01:09:48.251 --> 01:09:49.617
Come on.

01:10:00.764 --> 01:10:02.530
Kevin Schuler.

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:05.800
Rye Bledsoe.

01:10:06.503 --> 01:10:09.971
You know, I'm...
  screwing two girls
  from your school.

01:10:09.973 --> 01:10:14.275
Oh, congratulations.
   That's... Wow.

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:16.544
You seeing anybody?

01:10:19.282 --> 01:10:20.481
No?

01:10:21.484 --> 01:10:22.917
I'm just asking.

01:10:24.688 --> 01:10:26.788
Hey, look, you know...

01:10:27.624 --> 01:10:30.458
Dennis is a real asshole
  for spiking you.

01:10:30.994 --> 01:10:36.564
And... my dad
  never should have
  disqualified you.

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:40.501
- He's a real asshole.
 -Yeah, it runs in the family.

01:10:40.904 --> 01:10:44.505
You know you didn't beat me
that night in Briceville, right?

01:10:44.507 --> 01:10:47.008
- In Briceville?
  -That wasn't you.

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:49.244
Oh, yeah, I know that.

01:10:49.412 --> 01:10:53.281
But everyone thinks it was me.
  Isn't that funny?

01:10:53.283 --> 01:10:55.984
- Everyone thought I beat you--
   -That's funny.

01:10:55.986 --> 01:10:56.584
Yeah.

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:59.687
You know, I've got
 the country mile record.

01:10:59.723 --> 01:11:02.824
I got the 1500.
   I got the 3000.

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.893
I beat you in 800 easy.

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:08.263
Yeah.
   Probably.

01:11:08.265 --> 01:11:11.399
Kevin. I am going
 to kick your ass in track.

01:11:11.401 --> 01:11:13.635
- Okay.
-    -Okay.

01:11:13.637 --> 01:11:15.470
Well, I think you're slow.

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:17.538
- Okay. Okay.
 -I think I am faster than you.

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:21.576
I think you're drunk too.
  I also think you need
 a little bit more hair gel.

01:11:21.578 --> 01:11:22.877
- It's water.
 -Hey, that's a nice shirt.

01:11:22.879 --> 01:11:26.447
Maybe you should
  unbutton it one more.
 I think it'll look good.

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:28.016
- Think so?
  -I like the look.

01:11:28.018 --> 01:11:29.484
- It's good Hasselhoff.
-    -Yeah?

01:11:29.486 --> 01:11:33.054
Real good.
  All right, good talk.
  See you out there.

01:11:38.528 --> 01:11:39.494
Can I feel that?
   Does that hurt?

01:11:39.496 --> 01:11:43.965
That's a...
  That's a good question.

01:11:55.078 --> 01:11:57.312
I wonder about Ellie.

01:12:01.017 --> 01:12:03.985
Yeah, I don't really
   remember her.

01:12:07.757 --> 01:12:13.594
If you...
  don't remember her,
   maybe that...

01:12:14.931 --> 01:12:17.999
means you didn't love her.

01:12:26.776 --> 01:12:30.545
She... She's dead.

01:12:30.947 --> 01:12:32.613
Kevin, I'm...

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:35.550
I'm here.

01:12:38.822 --> 01:12:41.089
Do you want to know about Ellie?

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:45.393
- Yes.
 -She was... She was perfect.

01:12:45.829 --> 01:12:48.396
Everything about her
   was perfect.

01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:01.642
Okay.

01:13:03.747 --> 01:13:06.013
You throw a good party.

01:13:07.517 --> 01:13:08.816
Thanks.

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:13.020
- What did you say to her?
  -None of your business.

01:13:13.022 --> 01:13:16.157
You don't think anyone cares,
   do you, asshole?

01:13:16.159 --> 01:13:18.993
- What did you just call me?
   -You heard me.

01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:21.462
What's up with him?

01:13:25.068 --> 01:13:27.668
I can hold my breath
  longer than you.

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:36.144
You're crazy.

01:13:36.946 --> 01:13:39.414
That's what I like about you.

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:46.521
All right. Three, two, one.

01:15:08.638 --> 01:15:10.271
Best two out of three?

01:15:15.078 --> 01:15:16.544
What?

01:16:15.805 --> 01:16:17.038
Ellie!

01:17:13.696 --> 01:17:16.797
Did you tell my daughter
  you love her yet?

01:17:32.749 --> 01:17:34.248
Help me run faster.

01:17:36.686 --> 01:17:37.885
Hey, man. Come, sit down.

01:17:37.887 --> 01:17:43.157
Okay. Look, look.
  A four-minute mile at
 the spring invitational.

01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:44.692
That would mean something.

01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:47.261
You don't think about
 running right now, okay?

01:17:47.263 --> 01:17:49.363
Look, I have to remember.

01:17:51.401 --> 01:17:52.199
You have to remember what?

01:17:52.201 --> 01:17:56.337
It's Jared and Bobby
 and Trolley and Ellie...

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:59.674
Look, I can't...
 I can't breathe without 'em.

01:17:59.776 --> 01:18:03.911
Okay, and when I run
  fast enough, I could
 see them, I could find them.

01:18:03.913 --> 01:18:07.748
So, I'm just asking you
  to help me run faster.

01:18:10.286 --> 01:18:12.887
- You dream about them?
-    -Yeah.

01:18:12.955 --> 01:18:16.057
Yeah. So are you gonna help me?

01:18:17.126 --> 01:18:22.396
Listen, okay? There aren't
 many people who could deal with
 what you have been through.

01:18:22.398 --> 01:18:26.701
You're really strong,
  and that does not
   make it easier.

01:18:26.703 --> 01:18:28.736
You don't know
  how to ask for help.

01:18:28.738 --> 01:18:29.437
I am asking for help right now.

01:18:29.439 --> 01:18:32.006
So if you don't think
   I could do it,
 why don't you just tell me?

01:18:32.008 --> 01:18:33.441
No, it's not that. All right,
  why a four-minute mile?

01:18:33.443 --> 01:18:36.043
Well, isn't that
  what everybody wants?
  It'll make a splash.

01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:38.012
It'll be a win-win.
 Then we'll both go to State.

01:18:38.014 --> 01:18:40.014
Hey, don't you dare
   pin this on me,
  you little prick.

01:18:40.016 --> 01:18:44.385
You promised.
  You promised me that you
 would teach me what you know.

01:18:44.387 --> 01:18:48.022
I said that I would
  teach you running.
   I don't--

01:18:48.024 --> 01:18:48.789
That's what I want!

01:18:48.791 --> 01:18:49.957
I don't think
  that's what you need.

01:18:49.959 --> 01:18:53.327
And, by the way,
  you've never run
  a mile in competition.

01:18:53.329 --> 01:18:58.099
You're setting yourself up
  for failure. It's...
  It's not healthy.

01:18:58.101 --> 01:19:00.768
You don't have
  enough of a base.

01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:03.070
I ran a 120 miles this week.

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:07.408
I averaged a 100 miles
  through the fall.
   I have a base.

01:19:09.512 --> 01:19:13.447
Whoa! I thought
  you were joking.

01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:15.850
Why?

01:19:17.353 --> 01:19:22.323
Because this is what I do.
   This is me.

01:19:26.362 --> 01:19:27.828
You haven't done
   any speed work.

01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:29.964
We have four weeks.

01:19:29.966 --> 01:19:33.834
I could do it.
   I could do it.
  If just help me.

01:19:43.246 --> 01:19:44.979
This is a maybe.

01:19:52.054 --> 01:19:53.821
What are we doing here?

01:19:54.023 --> 01:19:56.924
Old track will be easier
   on your legs.

01:20:17.446 --> 01:20:19.213
This is weird.

01:20:20.049 --> 01:20:21.282
Come on.

01:20:28.191 --> 01:20:29.590
Okay.

01:20:30.259 --> 01:20:34.195
We're gonna run... ten 400s.

01:20:34.197 --> 01:20:36.330
Two to four seconds
  above race pace. Okay?

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:40.034
With 400 cool in between.
  Let's go. Come on.
 What are you waiting for?

01:20:40.036 --> 01:20:43.037
- Let's get warmed up.

01:21:08.231 --> 01:21:11.365
Go, go. Go! Go!

01:21:14.871 --> 01:21:18.572
63. That's good.
But you let an old man beat you.

01:21:18.574 --> 01:21:20.541
I was taking it easy.
  I didn't want you
  to pull a testicle.

01:21:20.543 --> 01:21:27.047
Hey, hey, hey. There is
 running around in circles,
 and there is smart training.

01:21:27.049 --> 01:21:28.582
Let's focus.

01:21:28.584 --> 01:21:30.951
Focus. Let's focus.

01:21:51.374 --> 01:21:52.439
How do you feel?

01:21:52.441 --> 01:21:54.008
My quads burned
   on that one.

01:21:54.010 --> 01:21:58.178
Oh, yeah?
  What's in your head?
  What are you thinking?

01:21:58.180 --> 01:21:59.013
Nothing.

01:21:59.015 --> 01:22:02.383
That's good.
  What do you want?

01:22:02.385 --> 01:22:04.551
I wanna run faster.

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:09.056
Your heart. Look up at me.

01:22:11.027 --> 01:22:12.393
Your heart.

01:22:13.062 --> 01:22:15.930
Most important muscle
  you got in your body.

01:22:15.932 --> 01:22:20.501
It never rests,
 but it remembers everything.

01:22:21.570 --> 01:22:25.005
You run with your heart.

01:22:26.008 --> 01:22:29.410
You run with your heart.

01:22:29.979 --> 01:22:31.245
Okay?

01:22:32.114 --> 01:22:33.681
Ten more quarters now.

01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:35.316
Ten more?

01:22:35.318 --> 01:22:37.284
That's crazy.
   That's like two
  and a half miles.

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:40.321
Hey, you got endurance,
  but endurance doesn't
   mean anything.

01:22:40.323 --> 01:22:43.157
And you got speed,
but speed is a fart in the wind.

01:22:43.159 --> 01:22:44.992
I need your body to know
 that you can run at this pace.

01:22:44.994 --> 01:22:49.697
You could do it in your sleep,
 I need your mind to know it,
 I need your heart to know it.

01:22:49.699 --> 01:22:53.000
We're training for one race,
  four weeks away.

01:22:53.002 --> 01:22:59.707
I don't care what you
  feel like tomorrow.
 This, right now, is the test!

01:23:00.576 --> 01:23:03.477
So, let's see
  what you got, hotshot!

01:23:06.215 --> 01:23:08.749
Finish strong, yeah,
   finish strong!

01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:11.652
Let's go. Finish strong!

01:23:35.111 --> 01:23:36.610
Yes!

01:23:38.681 --> 01:23:44.318
- 63.
  -That's harder than
 any mile you will ever do.

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:46.253
Ten more.

01:23:46.255 --> 01:23:48.188
No, no, you're done.
  You passed the test.

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:51.125
I want extra credit.
  You rest, old man.

01:23:51.127 --> 01:23:53.293
You can stop if you want!

01:24:13.215 --> 01:24:15.349
Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

01:24:15.351 --> 01:24:17.217
Wait, wait, wait!
   Wait, wait!

01:24:17.219 --> 01:24:20.087
Come on, open the door!
   Open the door!

01:24:20.089 --> 01:24:25.292
I'm here! Get this open!
  Come on, let me in.

01:24:25.494 --> 01:24:28.495
That's good.
  That's great vomiting.
   Here. Drink.

01:24:28.497 --> 01:24:31.532
- No, when I am done.
   -You're done.

01:24:31.534 --> 01:24:33.567
- Here.

01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:37.204
Hey, hey, hey.
  I said, "You're done."

01:24:41.377 --> 01:24:43.210
Give me your hand.

01:25:03.632 --> 01:25:07.601
Uh, leave it.
  My dad sees that,
   it'll kill him.

01:25:08.804 --> 01:25:12.339
Hey, come here.
 I want to show you something.

01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:13.140
What?

01:25:13.142 --> 01:25:15.375
Come on, speedy.
  Need a wheelchair?

01:25:15.377 --> 01:25:16.710
Coming. I'm coming.

01:25:16.712 --> 01:25:19.279
Whoo! How fast is it?

01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:22.883
I don't know.
 I feel like corporate meat.

01:25:22.885 --> 01:25:24.418
I want one.

01:25:24.653 --> 01:25:26.186
It's yours.

01:25:26.188 --> 01:25:26.753
What?

01:25:26.755 --> 01:25:27.821
- Take it.
   -Stop playing.

01:25:27.823 --> 01:25:30.691
Drive up to Hibernia,
   see that doctor.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:32.726
Send me the bill.

01:25:32.728 --> 01:25:35.395
- Your sugar daddy.
 -All right, Mr. Moneybags.

01:25:35.397 --> 01:25:37.798
Start hanging out
  with you more often.

01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:43.804
- Hey, Mr. Sickle.
   -Hey, Kevin.

01:25:44.673 --> 01:25:47.441
Caught on a stick there.

01:25:49.812 --> 01:25:52.246
How's that big school
   treating you?

01:25:52.248 --> 01:25:54.248
I get by.

01:25:54.583 --> 01:25:56.817
I've been reading about you.

01:25:56.819 --> 01:26:00.454
I am happy to see something good
 is coming out of Carton.

01:26:00.589 --> 01:26:02.189
When the pond freezes over,

01:26:02.191 --> 01:26:06.193
we're gonna put the hockey nets
 back out like you and Bobby
    used to.

01:26:06.195 --> 01:26:08.362
- What do you think about that?
    -Sure.

01:26:08.364 --> 01:26:10.831
- What are you doing right now?
   -I'm on a run.

01:26:10.833 --> 01:26:14.368
Do you want to take
  just a little break?
 I want to show you something.

01:26:14.370 --> 01:26:17.237
- Yeah. Yeah.
  -Okay. Let's go.

01:26:35.457 --> 01:26:38.325
I really wanted you to see this.

01:26:38.327 --> 01:26:41.929
I like coming out here when
 the wind howls a little bit.

01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:44.431
You remember
  that go-kart he built?

01:26:44.433 --> 01:26:48.302
It burned alcohol.
   It went like
  500 miles an hour.

01:26:50.639 --> 01:26:52.372
That kid could build anything.

01:26:52.374 --> 01:26:55.642
It'd have been better
 if he had been here to help me.

01:27:00.683 --> 01:27:02.849
Go ahead. You can go in.

01:27:16.565 --> 01:27:18.999
It's all Bobby's stuff.

01:27:22.471 --> 01:27:24.004
You see that blue glass?

01:27:25.541 --> 01:27:28.008
It keeps bad stuff away.

01:27:29.011 --> 01:27:31.778
You'll always be safe in here.

01:27:37.686 --> 01:27:41.722
You beat them
 at the invitational now!
  Bobby would like that!

01:27:41.724 --> 01:27:43.457
I promise!

01:28:02.711 --> 01:28:06.013
¶ I remember in the winter ¶

01:28:06.015 --> 01:28:09.483
¶ When you told me
   I was bitter ¶

01:28:09.485 --> 01:28:14.454
¶ That the fallen
  weren't coming home ¶

01:28:17.026 --> 01:28:20.460
¶ I remember when the splinter ¶

01:28:20.462 --> 01:28:23.930
¶ Only dug itself much deeper ¶

01:28:23.932 --> 01:28:28.935
¶ We had fallen on hard times ¶

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:51.658
¶ When my bones
  are cold as stone ¶

01:28:55.064 --> 01:28:56.496
Hey.

01:28:56.965 --> 01:28:59.466
What are you doing here?

01:28:59.468 --> 01:29:00.701
I...

01:29:01.036 --> 01:29:05.505
I'm going to go to State.
   I decided that.

01:29:07.509 --> 01:29:10.777
You came all the way over here
  to tell me that?

01:29:13.982 --> 01:29:18.652
Have you ever thought about
  going someplace else?

01:29:18.887 --> 01:29:21.421
Montana. Maybe, yeah.

01:29:21.423 --> 01:29:24.057
Yeah, we also talked
   about Boston.

01:29:25.394 --> 01:29:26.893
Okay. Right.

01:29:28.864 --> 01:29:31.832
Are you even going
  to call me next year?

01:29:33.369 --> 01:29:35.736
- God, you're such an asshole.
  -I am an asshole.

01:29:35.738 --> 01:29:40.474
No, but that's the thing.
  You're... you're not.

01:29:42.144 --> 01:29:44.611
- I should go.
 -Let me just drive you home.

01:29:44.613 --> 01:29:48.115
No, no, hey. I'm good.

01:30:18.147 --> 01:30:21.181
You sold this place out.
  How do you feel?

01:30:21.183 --> 01:30:23.817
They'll get
  their six bucks' worth.

01:30:24.086 --> 01:30:26.453
Go win this race, boy.

01:30:30.826 --> 01:30:34.895
Men's 1600.
  Runners on the track.

01:30:35.097 --> 01:30:38.698
Sponsored by
  Watson Quality Ford!

01:30:53.749 --> 01:30:56.450
What's in your head?

01:30:56.452 --> 01:30:56.917
I can see it.

01:30:56.919 --> 01:31:01.154
Focus on pace first half.
 My race begins third lap.

01:31:02.658 --> 01:31:05.826
Your... race.

01:31:06.895 --> 01:31:09.963
They're not your competition.

01:31:11.633 --> 01:31:13.834
Run your own race.

01:31:18.006 --> 01:31:21.641
You'll do something marvelous.

01:31:35.491 --> 01:31:38.658
Runners to your lines!

01:31:44.833 --> 01:31:45.065
Hi.

01:31:45.067 --> 01:31:50.237
Runners, when
your left shoulder is clear, you
are free to break to the inside.

01:32:10.025 --> 01:32:12.526
Come on, Kev!

01:32:20.736 --> 01:32:22.769
Go, Kevin, go!

01:32:33.849 --> 01:32:35.782
He's two seconds ahead, lap one.

01:32:35.784 --> 01:32:38.752
You're on it right there.
   Stay relaxed.

01:32:38.754 --> 01:32:40.020
Whoo!

01:32:43.926 --> 01:32:45.292
Oh, my God.

01:33:00.175 --> 01:33:02.309
Yeah, go, Kev!

01:33:05.581 --> 01:33:06.813
Go on!

01:33:09.184 --> 01:33:10.650
One lap!

01:33:15.057 --> 01:33:16.823
Pick it up!

01:33:55.163 --> 01:33:59.132
Just open the door!
   Open the door!
  I'm here! Please!

01:34:02.137 --> 01:34:04.838
I thought we'd lost you.

01:34:15.984 --> 01:34:17.183
Hey.

01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:19.853
Sit with me.

01:34:33.035 --> 01:34:34.267
Ellie...

01:34:36.004 --> 01:34:37.704
Run.

01:35:01.697 --> 01:35:02.962
Yeah!

01:35:16.945 --> 01:35:18.378
Hey...

01:35:19.081 --> 01:35:21.414
Marvelous.

01:35:31.059 --> 01:35:32.792
Run.

01:35:58.120 --> 01:35:59.853
Run...

01:36:14.002 --> 01:36:15.969
I love you.

01:36:56.945 --> 01:36:58.211
Kevin.

01:36:59.181 --> 01:37:00.413
Kevin.

01:37:02.217 --> 01:37:05.485
Oh, my God.
   Oh, my God.

01:37:11.359 --> 01:37:12.926
Oh my-- Kevin!

01:38:19.227 --> 01:38:22.095
I love you too.

01:39:12.147 --> 01:39:14.147
Stop.

01:39:40.175 --> 01:39:41.541
Are you okay?

01:39:41.543 --> 01:39:43.643
Are you okay?

01:39:48.583 --> 01:39:49.749
Are you okay?

01:39:49.751 --> 01:39:52.218
- You just jumped?
    -Yeah.

01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:53.686
Yeah.

01:39:53.688 --> 01:39:55.321
Are you okay?

01:39:56.391 --> 01:39:57.623
I'm so tired.

01:39:57.625 --> 01:40:02.695
- I'm tired.
  -Then stop. Just stop.

01:40:13.208 --> 01:40:16.509
You're crazy. You're crazy.

01:40:17.512 --> 01:40:19.579
Oh, my God.

01:41:06.694 --> 01:41:09.829
¶ The dead live on ¶

01:41:09.831 --> 01:41:13.733
¶ When you close your eyes ¶

01:41:13.735 --> 01:41:18.538
¶ All your lovers say, yeah ¶

01:41:20.842 --> 01:41:28.181
¶ And when you open them,
   you never ask ¶

01:41:30.852 --> 01:41:38.091
¶ You tell yourself
  you're moving on ¶

01:41:38.393 --> 01:41:44.263
¶ But you're driving
   in reverse ¶

01:41:45.567 --> 01:41:47.800
¶ You turn around
  your tongue and toes ¶

01:41:47.802 --> 01:41:54.173
¶ You tell everyone
  where you're gonna go ¶

01:41:55.543 --> 01:41:57.577
¶ You never know
  who you think you are ¶

01:41:57.579 --> 01:42:03.683
¶ You're always meant
 to be doing something else ¶

01:42:06.688 --> 01:42:11.791
¶ Even when you're up
   you're down ¶

01:42:11.793 --> 01:42:16.129
¶ Even when you're out
   you're in ¶

01:42:16.598 --> 01:42:21.467
¶ And when you say
   you're done ¶

01:42:21.736 --> 01:42:26.172
¶ You've probably just begun ¶

01:42:42.290 --> 01:42:49.729
¶ Can't go through hell
 and not remember it well ¶

01:42:49.864 --> 01:42:55.201
¶ If only you knew
 what you didn't know then ¶

01:42:57.305 --> 01:42:59.805
¶ You change your name
 like you change your clothes ¶

01:42:59.807 --> 01:43:05.278
¶ But everyone knows
  playing pretend ¶

01:43:07.382 --> 01:43:11.284
¶ You had handshakes
  and heartaches ¶

01:43:11.286 --> 01:43:14.353
¶ And smoked a little pot ¶

01:43:14.355 --> 01:43:19.825
¶ Tried lots of things
  that you are not ¶

01:43:22.363 --> 01:43:24.697
¶ Tired of what was
   good and plain ¶

01:43:24.699 --> 01:43:29.502
¶ But everyone was
  doing the same ¶

01:43:33.508 --> 01:43:38.277
¶ Even when you're up
   you're down ¶

01:43:38.446 --> 01:43:42.782
¶ Even when you're out
   you're in ¶

01:43:42.784 --> 01:43:50.923
¶ When you say you're done,
 you've probably just begun ¶

01:44:09.544 --> 01:44:12.545
¶ The dead live on ¶

01:44:12.547 --> 01:44:16.916
¶ When you close your eyes ¶

01:44:16.951 --> 01:44:21.787
¶ All your lovers say, yeah ¶

01:44:24.659 --> 01:44:27.660
¶ When you open them ¶

01:44:27.662 --> 01:44:33.332
¶ You never ask ¶
