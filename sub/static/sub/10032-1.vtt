00:39.980 --> 00:41.160
God,

00:43.400 --> 00:45.010
my life is

00:47.910 --> 00:49.380
very boring.

00:52.260 --> 00:53.340
You...

00:55.820 --> 00:57.480
For what purpose do we live for?

01:25.180 --> 01:27.009
Daruma-san

01:27.010 --> 01:28.860
has come!

01:39.820 --> 01:40.820
Don't move!

01:43.020 --> 01:44.020
Don't move...

01:46.640 --> 01:48.050
If you move, you'll die.

01:50.530 --> 01:53.800
Daruma-san...

01:54.160 --> 01:55.420
has come!

02:09.020 --> 02:10.020
God.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.550
Give me back

02:14.820 --> 02:16.159
my boring life.

02:16.160 --> 02:18.900
Daruma-san... has come!

02:31.990 --> 02:38.160
Da... ru... ma....

02:38.170 --> 02:39.859
My legs can't take it anymore!

02:39.860 --> 02:42.560
Just hang on... How the hell are
we going to get out of this!?

02:43.240 --> 02:44.420
Why...

02:45.080 --> 02:47.020
Why did everyone have to die!?

02:47.960 --> 02:49.519
It's all that thing's fault!

02:49.520 --> 02:51.280
Not only can it move,

02:51.710 --> 02:53.189
but it can also speak!

02:53.190 --> 02:54.110
Hey, class pres!

02:54.111 --> 02:55.459
Like hell I know!

02:55.460 --> 02:57.600
Has come!

02:58.630 --> 03:00.420
Hmm? Tch....

03:04.560 --> 03:05.699
Then,

03:05.700 --> 03:07.879
let's try to run out the door!

03:07.880 --> 03:10.099
Why is it not opening!?

03:10.100 --> 03:11.500
Move it!

03:11.530 --> 03:13.660
Has come!

03:17.140 --> 03:18.730
Hmm? Hmm?

03:20.110 --> 03:21.939
Heh heh heh....

03:21.940 --> 03:24.560
No... I don't want to die!

03:29.550 --> 03:31.230
Calm down!

03:35.130 --> 03:37.000
Calm down.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.950
Anyways, what I do know is...

03:42.620 --> 03:43.620
has come!

03:44.200 --> 03:46.450
Hmm!? Hmm!?

03:50.560 --> 03:53.000
Tch! Boring..

03:58.840 --> 04:00.079
This "Daruma-san"...

04:00.080 --> 04:02.840
represents a death game.

04:03.890 --> 04:06.459
As to what and why this
event is happening...

04:06.460 --> 04:09.200
Well, that's the one thing
I don't understand.

04:32.220 --> 04:33.890
That game is very boring.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.731
If you want to steal it, go to
the other side of the shelf.

04:39.050 --> 04:41.550
The cameras there are dead.

04:42.460 --> 04:44.440
Hey, I used to steal them too.

04:52.150 --> 04:54.340
You should start being calm and bold.

04:55.890 --> 04:58.380
But how do we get out of this place?

04:58.740 --> 05:00.720
Take a look at Daruma-san's back.

05:00.730 --> 05:04.580
Has come!

05:08.010 --> 05:10.350
What's with y'all....

05:13.620 --> 05:17.019
Da....

05:17.020 --> 05:19.500
I don't know what the rules are,

05:20.080 --> 05:24.569
but I think the game ends
when you press that button.

05:24.570 --> 05:25.318
Ru... ma....

05:35.670 --> 05:38.920
san....

05:39.140 --> 05:44.809
Alright... Leave it to me!

05:44.810 --> 05:45.340
Hey, wait!

05:45.341 --> 05:46.860
Has come!

06:03.500 --> 06:06.900
Heh... Heh heh..

06:10.240 --> 06:12.929
Da....

06:12.930 --> 06:14.380
What now?

06:16.630 --> 06:17.630
Don't panic.

06:18.360 --> 06:21.259
And don't worry, guys. We still
have time to do it slowly.

06:21.260 --> 06:22.560
There's no time!

06:23.200 --> 06:25.880
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

06:26.760 --> 06:28.390
Shun is right.

06:29.800 --> 06:30.860
Look at that.

06:31.240 --> 06:31.740
Has....

06:37.270 --> 06:38.570
That's a timer!

06:38.940 --> 06:41.379
What happens when it reaches 0?

06:41.380 --> 06:43.540
I really don't want to say it,

06:44.260 --> 06:46.679
but everyone will probably die.

06:46.680 --> 06:47.180
Co....

06:52.260 --> 06:53.540
There's one minute left.

06:54.060 --> 06:55.190
Me!

06:56.060 --> 06:57.340
Heh heh....

07:02.120 --> 07:04.309
Da... ru....

07:04.310 --> 07:05.310
Damn it!

07:06.180 --> 07:07.680
Ma-san has come!

07:10.160 --> 07:12.719
Please! Stop this...

07:12.720 --> 07:13.720
Come!

07:14.260 --> 07:15.260
Come!

07:15.930 --> 07:16.930
Come!

08:07.620 --> 08:08.620
Forget it...

08:09.560 --> 08:10.700
We're screwed.

08:10.710 --> 08:14.539
Da....

08:14.540 --> 08:15.540
Then,

08:16.400 --> 08:17.840
I'll send you flying.

08:19.140 --> 08:20.360
Huh?

08:21.900 --> 08:24.380
Step on me and jump over
this pile of corpses.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.080
What?

08:26.780 --> 08:28.499
Still remember our lesson in P.E.?

08:28.500 --> 08:29.540
That one.

08:29.870 --> 08:31.260
Wait, but...

08:33.260 --> 08:36.599
san....

08:36.600 --> 08:37.760
Then come here!

08:38.650 --> 08:39.150
Has....

09:19.740 --> 09:20.240
co....

09:29.180 --> 09:31.500
me!

09:59.040 --> 10:06.300
Game over! Game over! Game over!

10:06.310 --> 10:07.490
Hell yeah!

10:09.040 --> 10:10.040
We did it!

10:42.080 --> 10:45.620
The switch was pushed by Takahata Shun..

10:50.450 --> 10:53.570
The switch was pushed by Takahata Shun..

10:53.910 --> 10:56.400
Live! Live!

11:03.170 --> 11:04.920
What the hell is this...

11:31.380 --> 11:34.680
Shun, still don't feel
like going to school?

11:36.200 --> 11:38.479
Nah, I'll go tomorrow.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.359
You're always saying that

11:40.360 --> 11:42.650
but it's been a month and
you're still not acting up.

11:43.590 --> 11:45.320
I already said "tomorrow".

12:03.900 --> 12:06.109
A car near a building

12:06.110 --> 12:07.590
suddenly exploded.

12:08.720 --> 12:11.539
16 nearby pedestrians died

12:11.540 --> 12:15.639
and 52 people that had injuries
was rushed to a nearby hospital.

12:15.640 --> 12:19.070
It still hasn't been confirmed
if a Japanese was responsible.

12:20.120 --> 12:24.760
Local government considered it to
be an act of anti-government groups

12:25.100 --> 12:26.760
though it is still being investigated on.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.400
Good morning, Shun.

12:45.510 --> 12:46.530
Y'know...

12:47.740 --> 12:49.740
Why aren't you going out with her?

12:51.680 --> 12:53.779
She lives next to ours

12:53.780 --> 12:57.070
so we've always been together.

12:57.730 --> 12:59.900
So you really can't say

13:00.460 --> 13:02.100
that I can have special feelings for her.

13:03.320 --> 13:04.780
Is that what you're really thinking?

13:05.570 --> 13:07.950
Don't you want to be with her every time?

13:08.620 --> 13:09.620
Yeah, yeah...

13:10.270 --> 13:11.920
Another boring day...

13:31.040 --> 13:32.940
Those guys sure are having fun.

13:37.330 --> 13:39.529
Reign of Louis XIV period...

13:39.530 --> 13:42.840
French monarchy ushered in their time.

13:43.420 --> 13:46.859
He said, "I am the State

13:46.860 --> 13:48.780
called the Sun King".

13:49.280 --> 13:50.280
Takahata.

13:50.540 --> 13:51.540
Yes?

13:55.920 --> 13:57.180
You can continue your sleep.

13:59.690 --> 14:01.730
Alright, here's what's gonna
appear in your test...

14:20.060 --> 14:21.220
God.

14:24.220 --> 14:26.080
Give me back

14:29.180 --> 14:30.650
my boring life.

14:36.740 --> 14:38.560
You're a mouse....

14:39.200 --> 14:40.790
Coming soon, it will....

14:42.480 --> 14:44.110
The cat is coming....

14:45.080 --> 14:46.459
Mouse?

14:46.460 --> 14:48.760
The cat is coming....

14:49.460 --> 14:51.360
The cat is coming?

14:57.300 --> 14:58.300
Ichika.

14:59.060 --> 15:00.060
Shun.

15:13.870 --> 15:16.380
Thank goodness... you're alive.

15:18.760 --> 15:20.080
What about the others?

15:22.080 --> 15:26.049
I want to save everyone...

15:26.050 --> 15:30.840
so I slip closely, bit by bit...

15:31.520 --> 15:34.950
and pushed the switch...

15:36.020 --> 15:39.840
but instead, I killed everyone...

15:40.900 --> 15:42.009
It's all my fault...!

15:42.010 --> 15:43.650
Then I'm the same as you.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.260
Satake was...

15:47.860 --> 15:50.009
Just what is going on?

15:50.010 --> 15:52.140
I also don't know!

15:54.660 --> 15:56.930
I know... Let's contact the police.

15:59.790 --> 16:02.720
Eh? Why?

16:06.430 --> 16:08.340
You're a mouse..

16:09.510 --> 16:11.420
The cat's coming soon..

16:12.120 --> 16:13.470
It's coming!

16:14.440 --> 16:17.370
Let's get out of here
and contact the police!

16:27.000 --> 16:28.200
It's locked here, too!

16:30.140 --> 16:31.400
Ichika, move aside!

16:50.390 --> 16:51.860
Oh, this one's open!

16:52.680 --> 16:54.070
One, two...!

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Everyone!

17:03.380 --> 17:04.579
It's no use.

17:06.579 --> 17:08.599
Once you come in, you can't get out.

17:14.960 --> 17:15.960
Ah.

17:21.160 --> 17:23.859
What is... this...

17:26.040 --> 17:28.000
Fit the cat's bell...

17:29.000 --> 17:33.510
for it... to end.

17:35.840 --> 17:36.980
What does it mean?

17:45.270 --> 17:47.940
Well, you two should change
to your outfit, too.

17:49.320 --> 17:51.720
We don't know what will happen
if we don't follow the rules.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.160
Hurry and get dressed.

18:02.700 --> 18:04.130
Hurry up and put it on!

18:04.840 --> 18:07.060
The school president is ordering you...

18:36.040 --> 18:38.920
The cat... it's here!

19:20.380 --> 19:22.100
Someone...!

19:22.440 --> 19:24.760
We are being eaten!

19:39.790 --> 19:42.320
Ichika! C'mon, stand up!

19:44.210 --> 19:45.890
Shun, what's that?

19:48.980 --> 19:51.109
"Fit the cat's bell for it to end".

19:51.110 --> 19:52.550
Then, it means...

20:03.310 --> 20:04.310
Over there...

20:04.980 --> 20:07.060
We have to shoot the bell there.

20:07.990 --> 20:09.480
9 minutes and 30 seconds left?

20:09.920 --> 20:11.460
It's impossible!

20:13.300 --> 20:16.920
Everyone! We have to shoot that bell...
over to that ring...

20:17.210 --> 20:18.490
to end this game!

20:29.260 --> 20:30.390
Alright, I can do it.

20:31.220 --> 20:33.320
Akimoto! Pass!

20:38.150 --> 20:39.230
We leave it to you!

20:49.740 --> 20:51.960
Within 365 days a year,

20:52.950 --> 20:54.520
I have never been lazy

20:54.710 --> 20:57.120
to practice shooting 500 times a day

20:59.590 --> 21:02.850
even if I split my nails 30 times.

21:04.440 --> 21:07.310
As to why I'm practicing basketball...

21:08.090 --> 21:09.680
I now understand.

21:11.590 --> 21:13.620
Everything is for this moment!

21:24.670 --> 21:25.740
It's gonna get in!

21:25.830 --> 21:26.830
Alright!

21:38.460 --> 21:40.030
His hands can move, too?

22:22.500 --> 22:24.580
Everyone, take off your clothes!

22:24.770 --> 22:27.011
That thing only attacks those
who wear the mouse outfit!

22:35.980 --> 22:37.350
Hurry!

22:37.640 --> 22:39.280
Take it off or you'll be eaten!

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
With this...

23:09.610 --> 23:11.620
we won't be eaten anymore.

23:11.880 --> 23:13.550
Don't fuck with me!

23:13.810 --> 23:16.710
You're the one who forced us
to wear these fucking things!

23:18.140 --> 23:19.460
I can't be...

23:20.210 --> 23:21.810
I'm not to blame for all this...

23:36.030 --> 23:38.440
You bastard! You told us...

23:44.450 --> 23:45.490
I see!

23:46.290 --> 23:47.930
There's no more mouse,

23:48.150 --> 23:50.080
so it switched to eating us instead!

24:17.610 --> 24:18.810
Only 3 minutes left...?

24:22.270 --> 24:23.590
We're running out of time...!

24:32.670 --> 24:33.690
I...

24:34.170 --> 24:35.230
will die.

24:36.900 --> 24:39.820
Over here!

24:46.770 --> 24:48.880
Over here.

25:00.760 --> 25:01.760
Shun!

25:01.960 --> 25:02.760
Will someone...

25:02.950 --> 25:04.330
shoot the bell...

25:06.140 --> 25:07.420
while I distract its attention!?

25:08.070 --> 25:09.070
It's already impossible!

25:09.540 --> 25:11.860
Kikkawa's dead, remember!?

25:11.960 --> 25:13.620
If this continues, then we'll all die!

25:20.430 --> 25:22.560
My back's itchy.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.150
So itchy.

25:24.970 --> 25:25.970
Who...

25:28.330 --> 25:29.220
So itchy.

25:29.270 --> 25:30.120
My back's itchy

25:30.140 --> 25:31.900
so I can't sleep, meow.

25:32.430 --> 25:34.970
Who will help scratch me, meow?

25:36.060 --> 25:37.090
So, it's this thing...

25:37.220 --> 25:39.990
So itchy itchy.

25:40.140 --> 25:43.400
My back's super itchy.

25:43.440 --> 25:45.120
It seems I'm the only one who can hear it.

25:45.450 --> 25:46.780
Why?

25:52.450 --> 25:54.040
Meow, meow.

25:55.030 --> 25:57.110
Meow, meow, meow.

25:57.400 --> 25:58.540
Meow.

25:58.750 --> 26:01.340
My back's itchy.

26:01.820 --> 26:04.740
So I can't sleep, meow.

26:05.300 --> 26:06.990
As I thought.

26:07.160 --> 26:09.620
Who will help scratch me, meow?

26:09.740 --> 26:11.380
What's wrong, Shun!?

26:12.110 --> 26:14.520
If you wear this dress, you
become this thing's meal.

26:15.110 --> 26:16.650
But at the same,

26:16.720 --> 26:18.480
you can understand what
this thing's saying.

26:20.650 --> 26:21.650
Okay...

26:40.280 --> 26:42.600
How's that!? Feeling good yet!?

26:45.550 --> 26:47.940
More. More.

26:48.080 --> 26:50.470
I want you to scratch me more, meow.

26:57.480 --> 27:01.050
More. Scratch me more, meow.

27:09.210 --> 27:10.970
More. More.

27:11.220 --> 27:12.470
More. More.

27:12.490 --> 27:15.460
Everyone! Help me out here!

27:15.780 --> 27:17.860
It's pretty hard!

27:18.920 --> 27:22.680
So itchy. So itchy.

27:23.720 --> 27:26.500
Who will help scratch me, meow?

27:26.810 --> 27:28.890
More. More.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.690
Scratch me more, meow.

27:38.720 --> 27:40.480
More. More.

27:40.620 --> 27:43.500
Scratch me more, meow.
- Ichika!

28:05.230 --> 28:07.720
So good.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.120
We did it.

28:26.310 --> 28:28.220
Good, we have our chance.

28:31.380 --> 28:32.510
Wait a minute!

28:34.130 --> 28:35.220
Don't you think

28:35.410 --> 28:36.330
maybe it will be like that
time with the Daruma?

28:36.400 --> 28:39.230
That the only one who
accomplished the task will live?

28:39.730 --> 28:40.720
This time, we all put the cat to sleep

28:40.820 --> 28:42.820
and each have played their part.

28:43.190 --> 28:43.960
So I think we will all survive.

28:44.030 --> 28:45.790
Are you sure we will all survive!?

28:46.620 --> 28:47.820
That's...

28:50.120 --> 28:51.120
Then...

28:53.780 --> 28:54.600
I'll do it.

28:56.640 --> 28:58.280
Who the hell agrees with you?

28:59.240 --> 29:00.110
I'll do it.

29:00.230 --> 29:02.020
This time, it should be ladies first.

29:02.090 --> 29:03.540
Get off, you sow!

29:03.730 --> 29:04.730
It's gotta be me!

29:04.800 --> 29:06.220
Let go!

29:08.830 --> 29:11.000
Now's not the time to
fight with each other!

29:11.100 --> 29:12.020
You're saying that

29:12.060 --> 29:13.320
but you actually want to
save your own skin, too!

29:13.420 --> 29:14.550
Don't lie to us!

29:20.130 --> 29:22.110
Everyone, calm down!

29:22.520 --> 29:24.240
If you don't keep quiet, that thing will...

29:29.280 --> 29:30.680
Get off me!

29:31.310 --> 29:33.070
This is the student president's order!

29:33.140 --> 29:34.640
Using your position to save yourself,

29:34.710 --> 29:35.950
you're no more than a bully!

29:44.300 --> 29:47.900
That's why... I told you to
hurry and give it to me...

29:50.480 --> 29:52.400
If we fail to make it fall
asleep again, then...

29:54.750 --> 29:55.790
This is it...

29:56.710 --> 29:58.400
We don't have much time...

29:59.080 --> 30:00.240
Then, what do we do?

30:01.540 --> 30:02.540
Just how...

30:04.030 --> 30:05.430
how will we do it?

30:12.480 --> 30:14.041
Ichika, take the bell and come with me!

30:15.740 --> 30:16.740
Over here!

30:18.180 --> 30:20.200
Don't let them escape!

30:33.630 --> 30:37.320
So, one's a bell and the other
one's a basketball, right?

30:42.640 --> 30:43.640
Its eyes?

30:43.750 --> 30:46.330
Having seen the structure of the bell

30:47.130 --> 30:48.410
with the possibility of
going through the ring,

30:48.480 --> 30:49.930
the cat caught it.

30:50.770 --> 30:54.540
In other words, that thing will first need
to see a confirmation if that is the bell.

30:54.880 --> 30:58.400
In this case, we need to
delay its confirmation time.

30:58.860 --> 31:00.170
And the success rate is...

31:01.320 --> 31:02.920
50%.

31:05.140 --> 31:07.060
Let's see if you can guess
which one's the bell!

31:15.960 --> 31:17.210
That idiot!

31:17.260 --> 31:18.560
Not securing the cover enough!

31:18.710 --> 31:20.180
Then the one with the bell is...!

31:46.040 --> 31:47.610
The real one is here!

31:50.510 --> 31:52.590
It can't be.

31:52.630 --> 31:54.780
Then letting it see the ball was...

31:54.830 --> 31:55.830
Intentional.

31:55.990 --> 31:58.360
To make it think that I'm
the one holding the bell.

32:00.940 --> 32:02.270
Go inside!

32:06.470 --> 32:07.470
It can't...

32:11.110 --> 32:12.310
God.

32:18.640 --> 32:19.640
Amaya...

32:34.000 --> 32:36.290
Game over....

32:42.400 --> 32:43.510
We did it...

32:43.730 --> 32:44.730
Not yet.

32:49.090 --> 32:50.630
It's still too early to celebrate.

32:59.110 --> 33:01.500
This time, the ones who survived are...

33:03.210 --> 33:04.900
Amaya Takeru.

33:13.640 --> 33:15.740
Takahata Shun.

33:18.260 --> 33:20.280
Akimoto Ichika.

33:20.360 --> 33:21.080
Alright,

33:21.270 --> 33:22.000
I know we can do it!

33:22.050 --> 33:24.460
3 people in all. Live.

33:26.340 --> 33:27.140
Live.

33:27.330 --> 33:28.780
What about the others?

33:49.810 --> 33:52.230
This is God's will.

33:53.100 --> 33:55.750
A world where the strong preys the weak.

33:58.020 --> 33:59.790
Those who survived are strong.

33:59.910 --> 34:01.450
Those who died are weak.

34:02.150 --> 34:04.620
I've always dreamed of such a world.

34:05.940 --> 34:07.200
Thank you, God.

34:07.300 --> 34:08.719
You have my gratitude.

34:10.679 --> 34:12.050
This bastard...

34:12.699 --> 34:13.699
is dangerous.

34:14.030 --> 34:16.159
Those who are incompetent
are granted death,

34:16.370 --> 34:18.980
chosen by God as "unqualified".

34:20.429 --> 34:21.980
Don't you think like that, too?

34:22.889 --> 34:24.150
Takahata Shun.

34:25.139 --> 34:26.610
I don't think like that.

34:26.730 --> 34:27.730
You're wrong.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.320
You and I are the same.

34:32.500 --> 34:33.500
How so?

34:34.679 --> 34:35.880
I can tell from your smell.

34:37.429 --> 34:40.350
You perceive your life as boring
like your time doesn't flow.

34:41.659 --> 34:43.469
So in order to survive this life,

34:43.949 --> 34:45.230
we're chosen.

34:47.429 --> 34:50.030
Cut the crap and just
tell me what you mean!

34:53.389 --> 34:55.679
Nice expression you're having.

35:00.490 --> 35:01.490
You

35:02.320 --> 35:04.210
are also looking forward to this world.

35:07.400 --> 35:08.770
The same as me.

35:13.090 --> 35:14.110
You're wrong.

35:16.640 --> 35:18.530
Shun and you aren't the same.

35:19.710 --> 35:23.070
He's more gentle... and stronger...

35:24.350 --> 35:26.200
That's why you're both
completely different!

35:30.430 --> 35:31.470
Is that right?

35:35.400 --> 35:36.470
Stop!

35:44.820 --> 35:51.510
New York. Washington. Moscow.
Sydney. Madrid. London.

35:52.260 --> 35:53.970
All national high schools among them

35:54.310 --> 35:56.460
are experiencing some kind
of terrorist attacks.

35:57.330 --> 35:59.450
We have some information

35:59.740 --> 36:04.980
saying that 10 million
of our youth has died.

36:07.060 --> 36:10.010
Just now, a new report came in.

36:11.140 --> 36:14.010
The Prime Minister,

36:14.280 --> 36:18.400
from the Prime Minister's official residence, has
established an Emergency Countermeasures Headquarters

36:18.770 --> 36:21.110
and raising the national
levels as "dangerous".

36:40.770 --> 36:42.050
Just behind me,

36:42.190 --> 36:43.350
large cubes suddenly appeared

36:43.500 --> 36:46.130
all around the world.

36:46.270 --> 36:47.770
The reason is still unknown.

36:48.180 --> 36:51.750
It is believed that the
students who survived

36:51.900 --> 36:58.270
are being held inside the cube.

36:58.440 --> 37:03.780
Right now, the police and self-defense forces are
being deployed to implement the rescue operations.

37:03.870 --> 37:08.990
But they can't find even a
single entrance on the cube.

37:51.830 --> 37:55.140
The next cube appeared on Hokkaido

37:55.260 --> 37:56.900
and is being tracked by the Sato network.

37:56.950 --> 37:58.300
The current situation is...

37:59.270 --> 38:02.810
Not again...

38:15.150 --> 38:17.780
SDF also looks like there is no way

38:18.070 --> 38:19.520
on making it on the main
road of the city...

38:19.670 --> 38:22.110
Thank you, old man.

38:24.670 --> 38:25.870
And on the studio is

38:25.990 --> 38:28.213
a professor from the University
studying human environment,

38:28.310 --> 38:30.410
Professor Okihira Tadakatsu.

38:30.610 --> 38:31.610
Mr. Okihira.

38:31.640 --> 38:34.350
These series of terrorist attacks
and the appearance of the cubes,

38:34.420 --> 38:35.750
what do you think about...

38:37.460 --> 38:39.930
This is not a terrorist attack.

38:41.590 --> 38:49.490
I have no doubt that this kind of
level can only be done by aliens.

38:49.920 --> 38:55.450
The situation is beyond the
scope of human cognition.

38:55.740 --> 38:57.260
Hey, hey. What the hell's he saying?

38:57.380 --> 38:58.040
But still...

38:58.110 --> 38:59.110
Right now,

38:59.730 --> 39:06.050
the surviving students are
being called "God's children"

39:06.610 --> 39:09.870
on the internet because they can
survive even in this situation.

39:10.130 --> 39:11.580
God's children...

39:21.580 --> 39:22.930
Takumi-chan?

39:23.610 --> 39:25.900
I'll put your dinner here, okay?

39:29.640 --> 39:30.970
Umm, Takumi-chan?

39:31.040 --> 39:32.080
You should come out and
see me once in a while...

39:32.150 --> 39:33.150
Shut up!

39:33.290 --> 39:34.290
Go away, you hag!

39:38.840 --> 39:40.870
God's children...

39:47.540 --> 39:49.590
God's children...

39:51.130 --> 39:53.550
God's children...

39:55.820 --> 39:57.680
God's Children.

40:05.020 --> 40:06.850
Oww...

40:06.970 --> 40:08.950
Are you okay, Takahata-kun?

40:12.820 --> 40:14.720
I had a dream of a cat...

40:14.990 --> 40:18.150
blowing smoke on my face...

40:25.080 --> 40:28.050
Thank goodness. It's been a while.

40:29.140 --> 40:31.090
Takase-san, why are you here?

40:32.590 --> 40:34.110
Wait, where is "here"?

40:35.200 --> 40:37.520
I only know what you also know.

40:39.790 --> 40:41.600
When I woke up, I'm already here.

40:46.350 --> 40:47.350
I see.

40:50.190 --> 40:51.880
How many years has it been?

40:53.400 --> 40:55.800
Counting from the first two
days after I transferred...

40:56.450 --> 40:57.750
It's been 3 years.

41:00.020 --> 41:01.400
You look good.

41:02.970 --> 41:05.280
But I shouldn't have said
it in this situation...

41:09.700 --> 41:10.930
Hey, Takahata-kun.

41:12.210 --> 41:14.030
Why is this happening to us?

41:15.860 --> 41:19.220
Why do we have to experience this?

41:19.940 --> 41:21.820
I also don't know.

41:24.310 --> 41:25.980
But I'm glad I saw you again.

41:29.960 --> 41:31.870
I'm also happy meeting you again.

41:37.860 --> 41:39.930
Can't you keep your talking down?

41:49.010 --> 41:51.380
I'm in the middle of analyzing the vector

41:51.430 --> 41:55.680
using Helmholtz Theorem on the
attempt to escape from here.

41:58.820 --> 41:59.820
Come again?

42:04.830 --> 42:07.120
That is Taira-kun from
a private high school.

42:07.650 --> 42:09.770
And there's Taoka-san from
an all-girls' high school.

42:10.380 --> 42:11.560
They're both survivors of the "Daruma"

42:11.660 --> 42:14.080
and the "Maneki Neko" game.

42:27.820 --> 42:28.820
Taira...

42:30.250 --> 42:31.750
Taoka and Takase...

42:34.090 --> 42:35.350
Takahata...

42:37.620 --> 42:40.350
Then the rooms are being occupied

42:40.520 --> 42:42.980
by those that have the same first
letters of their surnames.

42:44.330 --> 42:45.730
Seems that way.

42:46.650 --> 42:48.890
By being here with me,

42:49.060 --> 42:51.360
this proves that it's not
according to IQ, but...

42:51.410 --> 42:54.299
You're starting to get on my nerves!

42:57.880 --> 42:59.010
What's wrong?

42:59.100 --> 43:04.130
Then it means Akimoto is in another room.

43:04.490 --> 43:06.520
Wait here for a moment,
I'm gonna check on...

43:07.820 --> 43:09.730
Dammit, not again...!

43:10.480 --> 43:14.000
Someone... can anybody hear me? Anyone!?

43:14.010 --> 43:17.530
It would be best if you
stop what you're doing.

43:20.330 --> 43:22.920
Suddenly appeared all over the world...

43:23.040 --> 43:24.870
all national high schools...

43:24.920 --> 43:27.210
meanwhile a barrage
of terrorist attacks...

43:27.840 --> 43:30.500
This is not a terrorist attack...

43:30.640 --> 43:33.855
occurring simultaneously
throughout the world...

43:33.987 --> 43:37.420
The Prime Minister, from the Prime
Minister's official residence...

43:37.961 --> 43:40.054
can only be done by aliens...

43:40.295 --> 43:42.375
and raising the national
levels as "dangerous"...

43:42.608 --> 43:43.654
this is what we should now be...

43:43.660 --> 43:45.540
Nobody can save us.

43:47.690 --> 43:52.370
The SDF can't even enter
the cube to rescue us.

43:52.950 --> 43:55.030
Then what should we do?

43:56.090 --> 43:59.350
Isn't it obvious? We'll just have to wait.

44:01.450 --> 44:03.580
For the next game to start.

44:06.450 --> 44:09.880
Do we still need to play these games?

44:10.000 --> 44:12.780
We need to, unless you have a plan.

44:14.680 --> 44:17.560
This is why I can't tolerate you idiots.

44:17.700 --> 44:19.510
The surviving students

44:19.950 --> 44:21.670
are being called "God's children" online...

44:24.610 --> 44:25.500
God's children...

44:27.630 --> 44:28.930
Has a nice ring to it.

44:29.780 --> 44:30.780
"God's children"...

44:34.460 --> 44:37.720
Find the key and open the door

44:39.530 --> 44:40.530
for the game to end.

44:43.540 --> 44:44.540
Here it comes.

44:52.010 --> 44:54.840
Let's... play... together.

45:12.630 --> 45:16.760
Taira-kun, let's play together.

45:16.860 --> 45:18.040
Very well.

45:18.450 --> 45:19.450
What are we gonna play?

45:22.460 --> 45:24.060
The name of the game

45:24.100 --> 45:25.790
we'll play is called "Kagome Kagome".

45:25.890 --> 45:29.580
After the end of the song, you'll need to
guess who's behind you within 10 seconds.

45:29.610 --> 45:30.700
You have to blindfold your eyes, though.

45:30.840 --> 45:31.930
No cheating!

45:33.880 --> 45:35.020
This is gonna be fun.

45:35.160 --> 45:36.250
Well then,

45:36.320 --> 45:37.790
let the game begin..

45:42.410 --> 45:43.710
Ready, set...!

45:46.490 --> 45:49.170
Kagome Kagome.

45:49.260 --> 45:51.730
The bird in the cage.

45:51.870 --> 45:54.360
When, oh when will it come out.

45:54.460 --> 45:57.090
In the night of dawn.

45:57.160 --> 45:59.740
The crane and turtle slipped.

45:59.860 --> 46:02.350
Who is behind you now?

46:20.610 --> 46:21.760
It's Akemi!

46:22.170 --> 46:24.640
Wrong!

46:25.360 --> 46:28.110
It's unfortunate, but I'm Hanako.

46:29.830 --> 46:31.300
Bye-bye.

46:31.350 --> 46:32.350
Wait...

47:16.500 --> 47:18.510
Well then, who's next?

47:22.660 --> 47:24.280
Let's see, let's see.

47:30.100 --> 47:34.060
Taoka-san, let's play together.

47:35.220 --> 47:36.830
I... I don't want to play!

47:36.980 --> 47:39.220
What's up with that? So boring.

47:39.300 --> 47:41.130
Then, can we kill you?

47:41.450 --> 47:42.870
That's right.

47:43.500 --> 47:47.020
A-Alright, I'll play. I'll play.

47:47.300 --> 47:48.659
We don't really mind..

47:48.660 --> 47:50.430
It's alright if you don't want to play..

47:50.520 --> 47:51.730
Not at all.

47:52.090 --> 47:53.570
I'm really looking forward to it.

47:54.050 --> 47:56.080
Do you really want to play that badly?

47:56.920 --> 47:58.470
Then there's no helping it.

47:58.730 --> 48:00.860
Then let's play..

48:01.030 --> 48:03.610
Kagome Kagome.

48:03.730 --> 48:06.190
The bird in the cage.

48:06.320 --> 48:08.900
When, oh when will it come out?

48:09.000 --> 48:11.460
In the night of dawn.

48:11.580 --> 48:14.070
The crane and turtle slipped.

48:14.190 --> 48:16.940
Who is behind you now?

48:26.090 --> 48:27.200
It's... It's...

48:32.610 --> 48:34.110
Time's up..

48:35.390 --> 48:36.470
No!

49:30.460 --> 49:31.500
Stop!

49:45.820 --> 49:46.620
Now then,

49:46.760 --> 49:48.070
who's next?

49:53.860 --> 49:57.050
Takase-san.

49:57.410 --> 50:00.280
Let's play together.

50:02.870 --> 50:04.700
I want to switch with her.

50:08.660 --> 50:09.990
Let's just get this over with.

50:10.230 --> 50:13.270
Good, good. Now isn't this good?

50:13.350 --> 50:15.230
Does this guy thinks that he can live?

50:15.330 --> 50:16.580
Idiot are idiots..

50:17.090 --> 50:18.540
Takahata-kun.

50:19.600 --> 50:22.300
Then let the game begin.

50:32.200 --> 50:33.290
Ready, set...!

50:36.160 --> 50:38.770
Kagome Kagome.

50:38.840 --> 50:41.310
The bird in the cage.

50:41.430 --> 50:43.960
When, oh when will it come out?
- Listen carefully.

50:44.040 --> 50:46.600
In the night of dawn.
- Listen carefully.

50:46.840 --> 50:49.320
The crane and turtle slipped.

50:49.420 --> 50:52.050
Who is behind you now?

51:24.240 --> 51:25.860
Okay, time's up.

51:25.980 --> 51:27.470
The one behind you is...

51:29.070 --> 51:30.070
It's Kenichi!

51:32.960 --> 51:36.920
The one behind me... is Kenichi!

51:40.010 --> 51:42.539
But your time's up, so you're out.

51:42.540 --> 51:44.740
No, I'm still safe.

51:45.200 --> 51:47.520
Yes, it seems so..

51:47.710 --> 51:48.800
What are you saying?

51:48.940 --> 51:50.610
His time is up, isn't it?

51:50.650 --> 51:51.690
It's because of this.

51:55.580 --> 51:57.220
Time's up.

51:58.120 --> 52:00.050
I recorded it when
Taoka-san's the one playing.

52:06.060 --> 52:09.080
Time's up.

52:09.130 --> 52:12.600
Your manner of saying "Time's up" is odd

52:13.500 --> 52:16.130
so I can easily know it's your voice.

52:19.650 --> 52:21.390
By recording your voice

52:21.510 --> 52:23.660
and mastering your arrangements,

52:25.330 --> 52:27.330
I can know who's the one behind me.

52:27.570 --> 52:29.340
The one behind you is...

52:29.720 --> 52:31.940
You're the idiot one.

52:46.720 --> 52:48.070
Takahata-kun!

52:52.520 --> 52:56.190
Thank goodness... Thanks for saving me.

53:24.460 --> 53:25.840
Give me your hand! Your hand!

53:26.100 --> 53:28.400
I'm getting lonely here!

53:29.820 --> 53:33.030
If you don't have any
friends, then play with me.

53:33.780 --> 53:35.950
Hold each other's hands!

53:50.440 --> 53:52.200
So, y'all are friends, huh..

53:52.830 --> 53:55.080
That's nice. So nice!

53:55.490 --> 53:56.490
Tch!

54:05.320 --> 54:06.500
We're safe.

54:06.980 --> 54:08.330
If we have someone to hold hands with,

54:08.410 --> 54:09.760
then that thing won't attack us.

54:23.860 --> 54:24.990
Takahata-kun.

54:29.990 --> 54:30.990
My hand...

54:32.620 --> 54:33.900
Please don't let go of my hand.

54:35.980 --> 54:38.270
I definitely won't.

55:47.670 --> 55:48.680
Want to do it?

56:12.420 --> 56:13.990
Pretty fun, isn't it?

57:18.140 --> 57:19.590
No!

57:20.580 --> 57:21.580
Let's go!

57:31.300 --> 57:32.300
Ichika!

57:32.830 --> 57:34.780
Shun!

58:01.730 --> 58:02.730
Tch!

58:04.650 --> 58:06.510
I'm so lonely.

58:14.110 --> 58:15.150
Thank goodness.

58:15.950 --> 58:17.160
Barely made it.

58:17.450 --> 58:18.630
Thanks.

58:21.380 --> 58:22.520
Where's Amaya?

58:23.340 --> 58:24.400
I don't know.

58:24.930 --> 58:26.400
We were in the same room,

58:26.940 --> 58:28.340
but he beat up those Kokeshi.

58:28.650 --> 58:30.850
He's also got the key and ran off.

58:35.700 --> 58:36.710
Shouko.

58:46.400 --> 58:47.530
It's been a while.

58:50.700 --> 58:51.700
Koutarou!

58:56.390 --> 58:58.040
What is this?

58:58.950 --> 59:00.930
Is this, perhaps...

59:01.370 --> 59:03.420
Insert the seven keys with seven people

59:03.590 --> 59:06.680
then turn it simultaneously
to open the door..

59:06.820 --> 59:08.930
Hey, how many are you?

59:09.600 --> 59:11.390
Only 4 people.

59:12.060 --> 59:13.420
So we still need one more, eh.

59:13.460 --> 59:14.460
What's going on?

59:16.150 --> 59:18.780
It seems we need seven people

59:18.870 --> 59:20.730
and must have all seven keys

59:20.830 --> 59:22.470
or else we won't be able to move forward.

59:22.790 --> 59:24.810
How many keys do you have?

59:24.890 --> 59:26.140
We have 2.

59:26.260 --> 59:27.980
We also have 2.

59:28.120 --> 59:30.630
So we still need 3 more
keys and one more person

59:30.730 --> 59:32.060
otherwise, there's no way to open the door?

59:32.200 --> 59:33.290
Now, wait a minute.

59:33.430 --> 59:34.570
What if no one comes?

59:34.640 --> 59:37.307
Then you already know what
will happen to us, right!?

59:38.020 --> 59:40.920
2 minutes left!

59:41.960 --> 59:44.030
In the mean time, let's try
to find the other keys!

59:44.760 --> 59:46.380
It's impossible anymore.

59:46.830 --> 59:49.590
With only 2 minutes left

59:49.930 --> 59:51.570
to collect 3 more keys...

01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:05.900
Amaya...

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.619
Awesome!

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.499
With this, we can get out.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:13.040
But we only need one more person.

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:21.380
That's not a problem.

01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:31.529
I only need him to avoid
being killed by the Kokeshi.

01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:33.260
He's useless anymore.

01:00:37.570 --> 01:00:39.100
Hey...

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:41.500
Do you know him?

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:43.200
I'm not fine

01:00:43.201 --> 01:00:45.200
being with this killer.

01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:52.060
We're friends, right, Takahata-kun?

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:05.289
Hurry up and let's go!
- I know!

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:07.290
Let's go, Amaya.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.250
One, two...!

01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:29.200
Game over!

01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:34.770
Takahata Shun..

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.569
Akimoto Ichika..

01:01:36.570 --> 01:01:38.219
Amaya Takeru..

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:39.809
Ouku Eiji..

01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:41.559
Maeda Koutarou..

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:43.560
Sanada Yukio..

01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:45.960
Takase Shouko..

01:01:46.530 --> 01:01:48.099
7 people in all..

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:49.100
Live..

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.100
Live..

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.329
Put on your clothes..

01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:55.859
Live..

01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:57.860
Live..

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:10.250
Why are our clothes here?

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.680
Come.

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:24.770
Here.

01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:26.860
Come over here.

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:42.649
Like I said,

01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:46.699
I'm here where I can see the video.

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.139
You failed to enter the cube, right?

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:54.780
Hurry and contact the media!
The aliens are coming!

01:02:56.420 --> 01:03:00.220
God's children...

01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:05.920
God's children...

01:03:09.610 --> 01:03:14.700
God's children...

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:34.000
Where are we?

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.170
Ice.

01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:47.860
What is it... this time?

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.289
Welcome.

01:04:14.290 --> 01:04:16.740
I like white.

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:24.250
Most especially pure white.

01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:42.650
Wha... What?

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:46.460
I hate black-hearted people.

01:04:48.450 --> 01:04:51.840
So don't ever lie to me.

01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:56.170
Just tell me the absolute truth, okay.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.930
What do you mean?

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.360
It's very simple.

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.999
From now on,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.219
you're going to honestly
answer my questions.

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.539
If everyone says the truth,

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:15.540
then the game ends.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.019
But if someone lied,

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:23.699
then pick one person as a sacrifice.

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.179
Remember that.

01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:26.249
Sacrifice?

01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:29.540
Well then, here's the first question....

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:39.280
What is...

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:45.700
your favorite food?

01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:48.920
That's it?

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:51.159
I thought it was a difficult question,

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.920
but it seems we can easily win this, right?

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:57.020
My favorite food

01:05:57.810 --> 01:05:59.209
is sushi.

01:05:59.210 --> 01:06:00.819
I like

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:02.259
ramen.

01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:03.880
Meat.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.580
Parsley.

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.659
Curry.

01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:10.660
Omelet rice.

01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:13.890
Milk crepes.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.079
I said don't lie!

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:36.200
Who's the liar!?

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.639
If you don't surrender the
liar within 2 minutes,

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:42.529
then I'll kill everyone!

01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:44.400
2 minutes left.

01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:47.740
2 minutes left.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:54.100
Who lied?

01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:57.759
Come forward at once!

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:00.039
Maybe it's you.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.680
Like hell it's me.

01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:04.449
What I said is true.

01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:06.449
Then where's your evidence?

01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:07.620
What do you mean,

01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:09.859
"evidence"?

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:13.010
You do know that we can't
find one here, remember!?

01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:18.279
What with that eyes?

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.479
Sanada, do you have evidence yourself?

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.890
I'd want to see it.

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.600
I'm cool.

01:07:25.610 --> 01:07:28.529
Isn't the most suspicious one
this goody high school student?

01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:31.459
I know he likes to eat curry.

01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:33.089
Even the omelet rice.

01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:35.313
I can even eat 3 meals a
day with it, no problem.

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:39.130
You're the one who's lying, right?

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:41.210
What?

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.680
1 minute left.

01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:57.649
59.

01:07:57.650 --> 01:07:58.619
58.

01:07:58.620 --> 01:07:59.620
57.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.049
56.

01:08:01.050 --> 01:08:01.730
55.

01:08:01.731 --> 01:08:03.139
This is the end.

01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:05.140
We're out of time!

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:08.860
Why...

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:15.330
You said that you like parsley, right?

01:08:15.370 --> 01:08:16.490
Yeah.

01:08:16.819 --> 01:08:18.099
Right?

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:18.760
Yeah.

01:08:18.779 --> 01:08:19.899
Right?

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:22.819
Right!?

01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:27.849
The food you like is definitely
the most suspicious!

01:08:27.850 --> 01:08:30.009
Everyone's tastes differ, doesn't it!?

01:08:30.010 --> 01:08:31.689
Stop it.

01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:34.639
You're the suspicious one!

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:36.129
It is true.

01:08:36.130 --> 01:08:37.840
What?

01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:40.879
Time is running out, yo.

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:44.439
So, who's the liar!?

01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:49.339
What!?

01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:51.340
It's you!

01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:57.920
It's him.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.038
You're wrong...

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.038
It's not me...

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.500
I really...!

01:09:16.979 --> 01:09:19.340
Like eating parsley...

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:42.000
Liars will have the same fate

01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:43.578
so be careful, okay?

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:46.129
Then on to the next question.

01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:49.819
Do I...

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:55.659
like Takahata Shun?

01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:57.880
Yes or no?

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:01.219
No!

01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:03.220
No.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:06.570
Well, I know it's just for
a little while, but...

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.960
Yes.

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:19.500
Then what do the girls think?

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:26.769
Well, we're childhood friends...

01:10:26.770 --> 01:10:28.770
and I have some feelings for him...

01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:32.160
so if I have to choose...

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.680
then yes.

01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:40.410
We-well... it can't be helped since
we're in this kind of situation...

01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:54.260
Same for me... yes.

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:09.979
You're pretty popular...

01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:13.120
aren't you, kid?

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:16.960
So, what about you?

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.880
As for me...

01:11:29.730 --> 01:11:32.530
No.

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:44.090
I never liked myself.

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:54.760
You guys!

01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:59.139
Someone lied again!

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:02.660
Who's the liar!?

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:06.130
2 minutes left.

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.770
2 minutes left.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.580
Who is it this time!?

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:19.699
Stop it already!

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:21.700
Maybe...

01:12:26.650 --> 01:12:28.080
it's you.

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:31.460
You want to kill us before,

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.619
but now you said that you liked Shun.

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:35.620
Isn't it odd?

01:12:39.850 --> 01:12:43.420
Kill and love are the same for me.

01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:49.460
Takahata-kun.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:53.250
Maybe it's you who lied?

01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:58.460
Because... saying you dislike yourself...

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.300
maybe it's different now?

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:12.560
Say something.

01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:18.560
It really is odd.

01:13:20.690 --> 01:13:22.660
In the first place...

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.699
everyone should be obviously saved
if we just answered honestly.

01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:29.540
But still, someone lied.

01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:33.700
For what purpose is that person lying?

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:38.969
So you've noticed, huh?

01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:40.969
That's because

01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:46.019
one of our comrades are among you..

01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:50.180
Putting on a human outfit

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:54.239
in order to kill you all

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:57.210
by lying.

01:13:57.850 --> 01:14:00.169
If you don't find the traitor,

01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:02.420
then everyone will die.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:07.079
I really hate it.

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:10.399
Those black-hearted ones.

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:14.900
I like white.

01:14:16.650 --> 01:14:19.040
Someone among us

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:22.120
is the enemy's comrade.

01:14:33.370 --> 01:14:35.639
1 minute left.

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:37.199
59.

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:38.600
58.

01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:40.679
There's no more time.

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:42.220
Wait.

01:14:42.370 --> 01:14:44.249
Now that you think about
it, the answer is simple.

01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:45.170
What?

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:48.249
Eiji and I are from a different school,

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:49.619
so we don't know Shun.

01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:50.689
But Takahata-kun,

01:14:50.690 --> 01:14:51.399
Ichika-san,

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.240
and Amaya-kun

01:14:52.241 --> 01:14:55.220
are going in the same high school
so they must've known each other.

01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:57.280
Then it means,

01:14:57.610 --> 01:14:59.640
the one who doesn't have an alibi is...

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:05.890
No, it's...

01:15:05.891 --> 01:15:07.890
That's right!

01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:11.199
You don't know anyone in here.

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:12.170
You're wrong!

01:15:12.171 --> 01:15:13.609
I didn't lie!

01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:15.819
We both are in the same school.

01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:18.039
There's no way she's the enemy's comrade!

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.119
It's even more suspicious

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.489
because there's no way
something like that happened.

01:15:20.490 --> 01:15:21.089
What!?

01:15:21.090 --> 01:15:21.980
It's a trap, isn't it?

01:15:21.981 --> 01:15:23.059
I believe in Takase.

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.060
Don't be fooled by her beauty.

01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:26.919
15.

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:27.899
14.

01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:28.680
13.

01:15:28.681 --> 01:15:30.999
If you don't hurry,

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.859
then everyone will die.

01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:36.769
Find the spy.

01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:39.010
Do you understand?

01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:40.659
10.

01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:41.969
9.

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:43.479
8.

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:44.649
7.

01:15:44.650 --> 01:15:46.040
6.

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:47.289
5.

01:15:47.290 --> 01:15:49.289
This one's the liar!

01:15:49.290 --> 01:15:51.609
Stop it!

01:15:51.610 --> 01:15:53.610
I said stop it!

01:15:57.900 --> 01:15:59.850
Stop!

01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:02.740
I didn't lie!

01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:13.360
I really...

01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:19.640
like Takahata-kun.

01:17:04.570 --> 01:17:09.560
Don't let go of my hand.

01:17:22.770 --> 01:17:27.570
It's a shame.

01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:32.460
She was really a human.

01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:03.049
Then, on to the next question.

01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:05.009
Wait a moment there!

01:18:05.010 --> 01:18:08.200
What is it? Stopping me
at the bast part, too....

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:12.520
I know now.

01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:21.640
The one who's lying all this time...

01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:25.260
I know now.

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:31.610
So, you've finally noticed.

01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:37.220
Who is it?

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:43.250
The true liar is...

01:18:58.730 --> 01:19:01.410
You!

01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:12.119
But I already knew that from the get-go...

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:14.120
What do you mean?

01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:18.569
The game is a farce right from the start.

01:19:18.570 --> 01:19:24.290
Making us believe that there
is a traitor among us.

01:19:25.410 --> 01:19:27.139
Takase...

01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:29.680
Takase's blood...

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.460
revealed the truth.

01:19:48.490 --> 01:19:51.820
You're not a pure white bear.

01:19:57.170 --> 01:20:00.240
So you saw it!

01:20:04.770 --> 01:20:06.960
Takahata!

01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:28.039
Hot!

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:28.690
Hot!

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:31.400
So hot!

01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:35.080
I'm burning to death.

01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:51.260
So the clearance is when
I tell you the truth.

01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:55.500
You're not a pure white bear.

01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:59.720
You're a cruel black-hearted bear.

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:04.080
A devil bear.

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:11.620
Game over!

01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:15.849
Takahata Shun..

01:21:15.850 --> 01:21:20.560
Amaya Takeru. Akimoto Ichika..

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:26.259
Ouku Eiji. Maeda Koutarou..

01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:28.809
5 people in all..

01:21:28.810 --> 01:21:32.960
Live. Live..

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.020
Please, stop running!

01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:10.319
I wonder what will happen next...

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.699
Probably...

01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:14.720
A game with "Ma" as the first
syllable in its title.

01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:16.970
"Ma"?

01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:20.579
So you didn't notice?

01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:24.440
All this is part of a "Word chain" game.

01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:26.439
"Word chain"?

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:28.440
Yes, a "Word chain".

01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:30.520
First, there's the "Daruma".

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:35.050
Next is the "Maneki Neko".

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:39.500
"Ko"... "Kokeshi"...

01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:44.300
and then the "Shirou Kuma".

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.579
That's right.

01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:50.089
Yes.

01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:55.459
So the next game must have a
"Ma" as its starting syllable...

01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:58.000
for example...

01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:24.180
"Matryoshka".

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:39.740
I'm glad you all have come this far.

01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:44.960
This is the last stage.

01:24:49.370 --> 01:24:53.080
Let's play happily to the end, okay?

01:24:53.490 --> 01:24:55.540
So, this is the last...

01:24:56.050 --> 01:24:58.859
What do you want to play this time?

01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:01.300
The last one is...!

01:25:05.850 --> 01:25:08.419
"Kick the can

01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:10.420
for it to end".

01:25:11.970 --> 01:25:13.940
Kick the can?

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:17.459
Yes. The rules are simple..

01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:22.860
The chosen "demon" will
first have to get the can

01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:27.060
up there and put it in
the designated place..

01:25:27.130 --> 01:25:32.050
Within this time, everyone
should hide from the "demon"..

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:35.210
After the "demon" sets the can down,

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:38.900
he will have to search
those who're hiding..

01:25:39.490 --> 01:25:44.239
If he found someone and saw their face,

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:48.459
he will have to shout their
name and step on the can..

01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:52.379
With this, the "demon" has
already caught one person..

01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:53.779
Those who are captured

01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:56.420
will be held inside this prison cell..

01:25:56.650 --> 01:25:59.319
But if someone kicked the jar

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.689
before the "demon" did,

01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:04.209
they everyone will be saved..

01:26:04.210 --> 01:26:10.380
But the can will explode
once it's been kicked.

01:26:10.770 --> 01:26:15.769
That's why in return for saving everyone,

01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:18.930
the kicker would have
to sacrifice himself..

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:21.779
Interesting, isn't it?

01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:24.599
The game will end

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:27.419
if the last hidden person

01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:33.449
kicked the can or if the "demon"

01:26:33.450 --> 01:26:37.980
caught three or more people..

01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:42.780
So if someone kicked the can,
that someone will die...

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:47.599
A "Kick-the-can" death game, huh.

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:51.129
Don't be like that. We're
here to have fun. Fun!

01:26:51.130 --> 01:26:54.160
So, who's gonna be the "demon"?

01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:56.920
These sticks will decide!

01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:06.140
One, two...!

01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:13.809
I'm the "demon".

01:27:13.810 --> 01:27:15.809
This is not good...

01:27:15.810 --> 01:27:17.809
Of all things, it's gonna be this guy...

01:27:17.810 --> 01:27:23.240
The time limit will be until the sun sets..

01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:28.289
Alright....

01:27:28.290 --> 01:27:31.319
Game start!

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.320
This way!

01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:37.939
Judging from the position of the can,

01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:39.339
that guy will be having
a hard time getting it.

01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:40.519
We have to run as far as we can.

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:41.880
Let's go!

01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:57.570
Amazing!

01:28:07.650 --> 01:28:10.120
We should be fine here.

01:28:10.290 --> 01:28:12.680
There's about one hour till the sun sets.

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:16.080
Before that'll happen, he'll
have a hard time finding us.

01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:19.280
Piece of cake.

01:28:20.010 --> 01:28:23.420
No... We're screwed...

01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:31.080
What are your names again?

01:28:32.690 --> 01:28:34.280
Dammit!

01:28:44.250 --> 01:28:47.299
Eh... What was it again?

01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:50.040
Ah, I remember.

01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:54.699
Ouku-kun and Koutarou-kun.

01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:57.160
Captured.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.920
As I thought, that guy's extraordinary.

01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:09.280
Just now... His eyes met mine...

01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:17.200
Okay.

01:29:25.250 --> 01:29:27.890
We can do it. Hurry!

01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:41.769
You go on ahead!

01:29:41.770 --> 01:29:43.770
Hey, Ichika! Ichika!

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:57.000
Akimoto Ichika, captured.

01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:41.419
This is the end for us.

01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:47.159
Takahata-kun won't sacrifice
himself to save us.

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:54.250
I don't think he can win against Amaya.

01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:57.410
Dammit!

01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:01.100
When the sun sets,

01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:03.720
we're finished.

01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:07.330
What should I do?

01:31:08.650 --> 01:31:10.860
Why should I...

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:17.490
Takahata! Can you hear me!?

01:31:18.170 --> 01:31:20.999
I caught 3 people!

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.680
With this, I can survive!

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:28.050
So I don't need to capture you!

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:31.259
So rest assured and come out!

01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:33.739
After the time ends,

01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:36.420
we'll both live!

01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:39.440
Live...

01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:43.209
We are chosen by God

01:31:43.210 --> 01:31:47.200
to live in this new world!

01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:49.420
This new world...

01:31:50.050 --> 01:31:54.440
You are also looking forward to this world.

01:31:56.570 --> 01:31:58.620
The same as me.

01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:01.130
I...

01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:04.639
I...

01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:08.720
Shun! Hear me out!

01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:17.130
I really... hate what this guy is saying!

01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:24.759
It doesn't matter what everyone says...!

01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:27.079
Even if it's for the best or not...!

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:32.090
Because even I don't want to understand it!

01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:39.060
I don't want to see your face ever again!

01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:44.680
That's why...

01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:51.820
Don't you dare come out!

01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:55.239
Don't ever believe

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.730
what this guy is saying!

01:32:58.730 --> 01:33:02.940
Just hide as far as you can!

01:33:03.650 --> 01:33:05.840
Do you understand!?

01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:11.760
Ichika...

01:33:17.450 --> 01:33:20.260
Shun and you aren't the same.

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:25.179
He's more gentle... and stronger...

01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:27.960
That's why you're both
completely different!

01:34:05.650 --> 01:34:07.489
Takahata!

01:34:07.490 --> 01:34:09.489
We're friends, right!?

01:34:09.490 --> 01:34:12.039
The game will end soon!

01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:15.320
Believe in me and come out here!

01:34:16.370 --> 01:34:18.139
I understand!

01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:20.720
I'm coming out now!

01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:24.820
Shun, don't be fooled!

01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:55.979
Sorry to keep you waiting,

01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:57.980
Amaya!

01:35:00.650 --> 01:35:07.650
As I recall, you can't shout my name

01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:13.099
if you can't see my face!

01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.100
That idiot...

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:17.719
What is he thinking...?

01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:21.729
It's true that he cannot see Shun's face

01:35:21.730 --> 01:35:25.459
and he has the chance to
kick the can unscathed.

01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:27.460
But...

01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:33.240
Amaya can easily remove his mask.

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:43.899
Takahata-kun, what is that?

01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:45.959
Come, Amaya.

01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:50.040
I'll be your opponent...!

01:35:57.530 --> 01:35:59.089
What's wrong?

01:35:59.090 --> 01:36:01.940
Don't you want to be my opponent anymore?

01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:10.649
Shun! Run!

01:36:10.650 --> 01:36:14.280
Wearing an armor is a bad idea, you know.

01:36:23.730 --> 01:36:28.260
Takahata-kun, captured.

01:36:58.340 --> 01:37:01.100
It's like you said, Amaya.

01:37:02.210 --> 01:37:04.939
Even now,

01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:08.759
I still think my life is boring.

01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:11.980
I thought it was better if
everything just disappear!

01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:16.090
I even joked to God about wishing it,

01:37:18.530 --> 01:37:20.960
but I didn't expect this to happen.

01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:25.500
Not treasuring what life I have,

01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:27.690
I'm a fool.

01:37:29.210 --> 01:37:32.129
Only realizing this now that
I lost everything I have,

01:37:32.130 --> 01:37:34.200
I really am a fool!

01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:39.060
We're alive right now.

01:37:39.970 --> 01:37:42.960
Forgetting to treasure and realize

01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:48.090
that each boring day is the best!

01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:51.520
I'm sorry, Amaya.

01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:56.890
I'm not like you.

01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:05.170
That's okay.

01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:09.410
I don't intend to help you from the start.

01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:13.369
Even if you're resisting,

01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:14.719
as soon as I step on that can,

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:16.300
you'll surely lose!

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:17.980
I wonder about that.

01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:23.659
I didn't just wear this
armor to hide my face

01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:26.770
nor to protect myself from the explosion.

01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:32.740
The reason for it is this!

01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:46.340
Shun.

01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:16.030
That's enough...

01:40:17.950 --> 01:40:19.360
Stop already...!

01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:20.840
Shun!

01:40:26.210 --> 01:40:30.510
Satake... and Shouko-chan, too...

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:36.450
There are still many things I
want to talk about with them...

01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:50.320
But still...

01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:57.280
why...

01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:59.200
did God let them to die?

01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:09.130
If this world really is created
according to God's will, then...

01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:21.220
To hell... with you!

01:41:21.230 --> 01:41:24.880
Shun! No!

01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:29.210
Takahata!

01:41:30.370 --> 01:41:31.530
It's going to explode!

01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:18.340
Huh?

01:42:33.710 --> 01:42:35.450
Game over.

01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:40.140
Because Takahata Shun
rescued all the captives,

01:42:40.530 --> 01:42:44.350
Amaya Takeru's number of captives is 0..

01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:47.270
Therefore, you're out!

01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:54.330
Akimoto Ichika. Ouku Eiji..

01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:58.990
Maeda Koutarou. And Takahata Shun..

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:01.750
You guys win!

01:43:02.850 --> 01:43:03.920
We did it.

01:43:04.690 --> 01:43:07.580
It's a bit unclear, but...

01:43:08.050 --> 01:43:09.330
We survived?

01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:11.750
We won?

01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:14.990
But why didn't it explode?

01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:16.610
Oh, that?

01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:19.160
That's a lie.

01:43:19.590 --> 01:43:20.660
Huh!?

01:43:20.730 --> 01:43:23.790
Because it made the game
more interesting, right?

01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:29.360
Don't fuck with me!

01:43:32.270 --> 01:43:34.110
I am chosen by God.

01:43:34.770 --> 01:43:36.200
I can't die here!

01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:39.880
Eh? What do you mean "die"?

01:43:43.210 --> 01:43:44.190
From the start,

01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:47.180
we only want to play with you all.

01:43:47.470 --> 01:43:51.690
No one said anything about dying. Ha ha ha!

01:43:58.580 --> 01:43:59.740
Seriously...?

01:44:00.970 --> 01:44:01.970
Then that means...

01:44:23.370 --> 01:44:24.370
Everyone.

01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:26.750
I congratulate you for coming this far.

01:44:31.110 --> 01:44:32.350
Then we're...

01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:35.079
We're really gonna live, right?

01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:36.150
Finally.

01:44:38.150 --> 01:44:40.690
This is your reward, everyone.

01:44:43.330 --> 01:44:46.240
You can get out once
you've finished eating.

01:45:13.350 --> 01:45:14.760
It's beautiful, isn't it?

01:45:22.650 --> 01:45:23.650
Hey, Ichika.

01:45:24.990 --> 01:45:26.410
After we get out,

01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:31.570
let's go eat delicious foods together.

01:45:33.570 --> 01:45:34.570
And

01:45:35.590 --> 01:45:37.870
let's see the movies together.

01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:40.440
Yeah.

01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:42.920
And then...

01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:49.910
I still want to do many things with you.

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:04.180
Ah. You can also help me and
mom clean the storage room.

01:46:04.230 --> 01:46:05.960
Do it on your own.

01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:18.110
I can't really remember my dad.

01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:22.390
He's probably training right now,

01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:25.530
but even so,

01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:29.120
it may not be that bad.

01:46:35.090 --> 01:46:36.090
This is good!

01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:13.590
Alright, I'm lucky! Look, Ichika...

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:16.560
What's up?

01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:27.510
Sorry, Shun.

01:47:34.030 --> 01:47:35.440
I...

01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:40.700
really can't go to the movies with you.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.500
"You live"

01:47:55.330 --> 01:47:56.350
Everyone.

01:47:57.820 --> 01:48:00.980
In order to get this far,
you need "Intelligence".

01:48:02.130 --> 01:48:03.130
"Endurance".

01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:05.260
"Imagination".

01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:08.510
Having all these abilities

01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:10.660
let you go as far as here.

01:48:10.970 --> 01:48:12.880
But, there is one more.

01:48:14.290 --> 01:48:17.120
Finally, there is one more
thing you need to possess.

01:48:17.470 --> 01:48:18.470
And that's....

01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:30.460
"Luck"?

01:48:37.060 --> 01:48:38.440
Shun.

01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:43.980
I may really have...

01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:50.030
liked you a bit.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.320
"You die"

01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:19.240
Bye-bye.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
"You live"

01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:41.860
"Luck"!

01:50:04.630 --> 01:50:05.670
Ichika!

01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:40.250
What the hell is this...

01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:44.240
Why is this happening...

01:51:05.710 --> 01:51:07.280
Takahata Shun..

01:51:08.650 --> 01:51:10.240
Amaya Takeru..

01:51:11.820 --> 01:51:14.640
Live. Live..

01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:36.290
The cube has now descended!

01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:38.830
And the surviving students
finally appeared!

01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:47.360
Takumi-chan?

01:51:47.550 --> 01:51:49.690
I'll put your food here.

01:51:52.650 --> 01:51:53.880
I'm going out for a bit.

01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:57.810
Go? Go where!?

01:52:00.430 --> 01:52:01.690
I'm going to save the world.

01:52:02.890 --> 01:52:06.420
Don't come home too late, okay?

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:22.000
God's children...

01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:51.300
There is no God.

01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:59.160
That's... wrong, you know?

01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:01.260
There's "Daruma",

01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:03.340
"Maneki Neko",

01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:04.900
"Kokeshi",

01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:06.550
"Shirou Kuma",

01:53:06.770 --> 01:53:08.440
"Matryoshka",

01:53:11.900 --> 01:53:12.900
and God.

01:53:13.305 --> 01:53:19.556
