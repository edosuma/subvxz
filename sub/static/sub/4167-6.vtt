00:02.036 --> 00:04.121
<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...

00:04.205 --> 00:07.082
Behold, the incorporated city of Majestic.

00:07.166 --> 00:11.253
What we need is to redirect a small portion
of our sewage through your town.

00:11.337 --> 00:13.547
Shit highway could be our road to riches.

00:13.631 --> 00:14.757
We need these votes.

00:14.840 --> 00:15.925
Golf membership.

00:16.008 --> 00:18.761
<i>- I play house.
- Motion is passed.</i>

00:18.844 --> 00:21.138
It was Celia Hodes who recommended
that I speak to you.

00:21.222 --> 00:22.765
You just got yourself a job.

00:22.848 --> 00:26.560
This community service thing
is totally unsupervised.

00:26.644 --> 00:29.730
- You sold $2,000 in a day.
- Impressive, huh?

00:29.813 --> 00:33.234
Your brother is mad at me.
I put him in Majestic summer school.

00:33.317 --> 00:35.986
Maybe you and I can solve a murder.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.947
Blood samples point to Kyle and Jill.

00:38.030 --> 00:41.242
Jill had an abortion.

00:41.325 --> 00:42.993
I'm setting in front of you documents

00:43.077 --> 00:46.872
which will honourably discharge you
from the United States Army Reserves.

00:46.956 --> 00:48.791
- Can you grow here?
- Hell, yeah. It's perfect.

00:48.874 --> 00:50.709
All right,
teach me some more grow business.

00:50.793 --> 00:53.671
Guillermo's crew is all moody
cos I jacked his horse.

00:53.754 --> 00:58.008
I left you a package in the garage.
I need you to hold onto it for a spell.

01:05.099 --> 01:08.102
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:08.185 --> 01:10.729
<i># Little boxes made of ticky-tacky</i>

01:10.813 --> 01:14.233
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:14.316 --> 01:17.194
<i># Little boxes all the same</i>

01:17.278 --> 01:20.197
<i># There's a pink one and a green one</i>

01:20.281 --> 01:23.075
<i># And a blue one and a yellow one</i>

01:23.158 --> 01:26.161
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

01:26.245 --> 01:28.956
<i># And they all look just the same</i>

01:30.583 --> 01:33.586
<i># And the people in the houses</i>

01:33.669 --> 01:36.547
<i># All went to the university</i>

01:36.630 --> 01:39.383
<i># Where they were put in boxes</i>

01:39.466 --> 01:42.303
<i># And they came out all the same</i>

01:42.386 --> 01:45.556
<i># And the children go to summer camp</i>

01:45.639 --> 01:48.309
<i># And then to the university</i>

01:48.392 --> 01:51.312
<i># Where we all get put in boxes</i>

01:51.395 --> 01:54.398
<i># And we all come out the same #</i>

01:57.276 --> 02:00.070
Good morning.
You want huevos rancheros?

02:01.739 --> 02:04.867
- Why are you cooking without clothes?
- No, I have underwear on.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.578
There's a cotton barrier
between my eggs and yours.

02:07.661 --> 02:11.624
Would you please take a walk
into the laundry room with me?

02:18.964 --> 02:22.092
Oh, please tell me
there's not a body in there.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.227
- Yowza.
- Heroin.

02:36.023 --> 02:39.318
- Heroin-o-licious.
- Put it back.

02:39.401 --> 02:43.489
Are you a smack dealer now, Nancy? Oh!

02:43.572 --> 02:46.200
Bringing the hammer down,

02:46.283 --> 02:48.661
turning out the bitch!

02:48.744 --> 02:49.745
Hardcore.

02:49.828 --> 02:51.247
How much is it worth?

02:51.330 --> 02:54.708
Ah... I'm no expert.

02:54.792 --> 02:58.712
I've heard tar is worth between
$40,000 and $80,000 a key,

02:58.796 --> 03:00.965
and we've got 20 keys and that's wholesale.

03:01.048 --> 03:04.677
Once you break down into chunks and balloons,
you're talking 10 times that.

03:05.594 --> 03:07.137
It's awesome.

03:08.347 --> 03:10.474
Calm down. You don't understand.

03:10.558 --> 03:13.394
Oh, wait, is your... Jesus, Andy!

03:13.477 --> 03:16.647
What? That's a lot of money.
I'm excited for us.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.984
Are you insane? This isn't ours.

03:20.067 --> 03:22.486
We're not heroin dealers.

03:22.570 --> 03:25.239
This stuff scares the shit out of me.

03:32.204 --> 03:34.707
- Hello?
- Good, you're up.

03:34.790 --> 03:37.209
<i>- We're throwing a party.
- Are we?</i>

03:37.293 --> 03:42.006
I had a vision in the middle of the night.
Think big and festive.

03:42.089 --> 03:47.052
Mixed drinks, strong. And real food.
None of that California healthy crap.

03:47.136 --> 03:51.181
Fried things wrapped in bacon.
Crowd-pleasers.

03:51.265 --> 03:55.144
<i>- When are we throwing this party?
- Tomorrow. It's for the Agrestic City Council,</i>

03:55.227 --> 03:57.605
and whoever else matters
in wherever the fuck you live.

03:57.688 --> 04:00.941
Nice. Tomorrow, as in 24 hours?

04:01.025 --> 04:04.153
Well, I was thinking late afternoon,
so it's more like 31.

04:04.236 --> 04:06.447
Your budget's five grand.
Make it look like 10.

04:06.530 --> 04:09.742
<i>I've e-mailed you a guest list.
Mayor asshole, councilman asshole.</i>

04:09.825 --> 04:12.411
<i>Any other important assholes
you think of, add them on.</i>

04:12.494 --> 04:15.789
<i>- Is this gonna be a problem?
- No, no, all good.</i>

04:15.873 --> 04:18.959
<i>Great. Wear something
that shows off those sexy legs.</i>

04:19.043 --> 04:21.795
<i>I look forward to seeing
where they end sometime.</i>

04:21.879 --> 04:24.089
That's your one for the day.

04:25.883 --> 04:29.678
- Did I hear "party"?
- Yes, for the city council.

04:29.762 --> 04:32.389
- Go on, get out of here.
- Oh, politicians.

04:32.473 --> 04:35.893
Shit! This is perfect.
We can unload at least a key.

04:35.976 --> 04:40.105
These are U-Turn's drugs,
and he's going to take them back.

04:41.899 --> 04:43.567
You...

04:43.651 --> 04:46.487
are going to shave and find a clean shirt.

04:46.570 --> 04:48.364
You are going to cater this soirÃ©e,

04:48.447 --> 04:51.283
because we are going to have
the party here tomorrow night.

04:51.367 --> 04:55.871
- Here? Not a restaurant or a hall?
- Not if we want to make four grand.

04:56.789 --> 05:00.960
- Take $1,000. Make it look like $5,000.
- I don't remember volunteering my services.

05:01.043 --> 05:04.463
Maybe I have plans tomorrow.
Maybe I have a play date.

05:06.966 --> 05:08.425
- You live here for free.
- Yes.

05:08.509 --> 05:11.887
You eat my food.
You wipe your ass with my toilet paper.

05:11.971 --> 05:14.223
I don't have to ask you shit.

05:16.642 --> 05:18.102
Finish frying your eggs,

05:18.185 --> 05:22.648
and think up a menu
that includes pork-wrapped items.

05:22.731 --> 05:24.441
And wash your hands.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.528
All I need now is for the boys
to eat heroin eggs for breakfast.

05:27.611 --> 05:31.115
Right, because then
they'd want them every day.

05:31.740 --> 05:34.159
<i>Welcome to your new home,
Miss Hodes.</i>

05:34.243 --> 05:37.538
We've got it promised out next week,
some folks shooting a movie.

05:37.621 --> 05:41.208
But after that, she's all yours.

05:42.084 --> 05:44.628
Thank you, Sullivan Groff.

05:45.629 --> 05:49.091
We'll have to keep it in the corporation's name
for the first six months.

05:49.174 --> 05:53.012
- A house is a fat piece of swag to hide.
- It works for me.

05:53.095 --> 05:56.682
Keeps it out of my husband's stubby,
little sausage fingers.

05:56.765 --> 05:58.809
- Husband?
- Yeah.

05:58.893 --> 06:01.896
- You're not wearing a ring.
- I'm separated.

06:02.521 --> 06:05.232
Dancing my way to divorce.

06:07.151 --> 06:09.737
This is an amazing living room.

06:10.446 --> 06:15.492
They call this the Great Room.
This is the room that sells the house.

06:15.576 --> 06:18.329
Flat screen goes right here.

06:18.412 --> 06:21.207
- What the fuck?
- Here, get behind me.

06:24.001 --> 06:25.085
God!

06:29.506 --> 06:30.758
Whore.

06:36.347 --> 06:37.848
- Cunt.
- Cunt.

06:38.891 --> 06:41.018
- And another whore.
- Whore.

06:41.810 --> 06:43.354
Fucking Doug.

06:47.775 --> 06:50.694
But you got to admit,
he's quite accurate with a 5-iron.

06:55.491 --> 06:56.909
I'm not dressed for this.

06:56.992 --> 06:59.537
You said you wanted to talk.
This is my fitness time.

06:59.620 --> 07:03.874
- Ow. Quit it.
- Bob and weave, bob and weave.

07:03.958 --> 07:05.584
Oh, no, too slow.

07:05.668 --> 07:07.586
- Come on!
- OK.

07:08.295 --> 07:10.130
When are you coming to get your trunk?

07:10.214 --> 07:12.341
- You looked, didn't you?
- It's in my house.

07:12.424 --> 07:15.511
And there it shall remain, grasshopper.

07:15.594 --> 07:22.184
Listen, I'm throwing a party tomorrow.
I can't be a storage space for your heroin.

07:23.227 --> 07:26.855
- Get the trunk out of my house now.
- No more complaining.

07:26.939 --> 07:29.233
Now, move your feet! Come on!

07:31.318 --> 07:32.570
What am I doing here?

07:32.653 --> 07:37.533
You are working off your debt
and your ass. Keep moving.

07:38.242 --> 07:40.411
- What do you want from me?
- I'm grooming you.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.830
I'm thinking about the future.

07:42.913 --> 07:45.499
That's cos Marvin is a fat fool!

07:47.084 --> 07:49.837
Maybe one day you'll be my lieutenant.

07:50.462 --> 07:52.298
- No, thank you.
- Ah!

07:52.882 --> 07:56.677
OK... Yeah, I wasn't asking,
and you ain't there yet.

07:56.760 --> 08:00.097
Just keep on watching and learning,
and we'll see what happens.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.974
Never turn down an opportunity to learn.

08:02.057 --> 08:04.226
- You're right.
- No, I'm left. Ooh.

08:04.310 --> 08:06.020
See? See what I'm saying?

08:06.103 --> 08:07.980
Listen... When we're done here,

08:08.063 --> 08:11.108
I'm gonna give you an address,
downtown, 7:30 sharp.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.193
- It's a surprise.
- I don't like surprises.

08:13.277 --> 08:17.198
You're gonna like this one.
Now, come on! Keep dancing, girl!

08:17.281 --> 08:19.783
- Bingo!
- Oh, so close.

08:20.701 --> 08:24.079
All right, new game. Picture frame.

08:24.163 --> 08:26.999
So that means we fill out the
whole outer edge of the card.

08:27.082 --> 08:31.670
Top row, bottom row, side,
and side, all filled in.

08:31.754 --> 08:36.717
Now, this is a long one, everyone,
so settle in and let's bingo!

08:36.799 --> 08:40.721
It's an indica blend,
so it's not too harsh, not too heady.

08:40.804 --> 08:42.640
It has a real calming effect.

08:42.722 --> 08:46.685
Son, I don't need a sales pitch.

08:46.769 --> 08:49.813
Just tell me this. Will it fuck me up?

08:50.606 --> 08:53.067
Yes, sir, it will fuck you up good.

08:54.109 --> 08:55.736
B-9.

08:55.819 --> 09:00.157
Good news. Your tumour is B-9!

09:01.033 --> 09:02.243
B-9.

09:02.326 --> 09:06.705
Hurry up and give it to me.
This girl is giving me a headache.

09:07.873 --> 09:09.375
B-4.

09:09.458 --> 09:11.377
And after.

09:11.460 --> 09:12.920
Very good!

09:13.003 --> 09:15.548
B-4.

09:18.008 --> 09:20.970
- N-37.
- What?

09:21.053 --> 09:25.474
<i>It is a known fact that in Africa
the lions rule the Serengeti Plain.</i>

09:26.058 --> 09:28.185
All right, I need you to try one of each.

09:28.269 --> 09:30.563
I have stuffed mushrooms,

09:30.646 --> 09:36.777
little smokies wrapped in bacon,
chicken satay, and rumaki.

09:36.860 --> 09:39.029
Feast and praise.

09:39.905 --> 09:42.825
- Is this dinner?
- Yeah. Sure. I guess. Try.

09:48.122 --> 09:51.292
- This sucks.
- How can it suck? It's wrapped in bacon.

09:51.375 --> 09:53.085
Not the food.

09:53.168 --> 09:56.380
This... Me and you. I want family dinner.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.424
I need to talk to Mom.

09:59.592 --> 10:00.885
I'm your uncle, talk to me.

10:00.968 --> 10:04.722
Can you convince Mom
that I'm better off sitting home all summer

10:04.805 --> 10:08.225
than stuck in a classroom
full of religious zealots proselytising

10:08.309 --> 10:11.437
a form of fundamentalism
that's two clicks away from jihad?

10:13.105 --> 10:15.900
Maybe you better talk to your mom.
Try another smoky.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.068
When's Mom coming home?

10:18.152 --> 10:20.613
Not sure.
She has a Ladies in Business thing.

10:20.696 --> 10:23.574
- She's at a drug thing, isn't she?
- No.

10:23.657 --> 10:26.702
Yeah, she's at a drug thing.
Your mother's a drug dealer.

10:26.785 --> 10:29.371
Why do you make me say it? Why?

10:29.455 --> 10:32.249
- Bud, where you going?
- I'm not hungry.

10:32.333 --> 10:35.252
OK, no more hors d'oeuvres.
I'll make some pasta.

10:35.336 --> 10:38.797
- We'll watch bikini chicks eat crickets.
- No, thanks.

10:39.465 --> 10:41.634
- I'm gonna go read.
- Reading?

10:41.717 --> 10:44.136
You kids today and your reading.

10:49.600 --> 10:53.979
<i>The male's barbed penis
will make sex so painful for the female</i>

10:54.063 --> 10:58.067
<i>that she snarls and snaps at him
when he retreats.</i>

10:58.734 --> 11:01.612
<i>So he bites the scruff of her neck
to hold her down.</i>

11:02.446 --> 11:05.783
<i>Now, the bites may appear to be
dangerous and aggressive, but they are...</i>

11:09.453 --> 11:11.038
Someone get the door!

11:15.334 --> 11:17.461
- Who is it?
- I don't know who it is,

11:17.545 --> 11:21.340
because someone hasn't put up
my security cameras like I asked 17 times.

11:21.423 --> 11:22.883
Hey, I'm working the crops here.

11:22.967 --> 11:26.637
You ain't doing nothing but smoking Mores
and running water through dollhouses.

11:26.720 --> 11:30.349
Why don't you get your ass up a ladder
and do it?

11:30.432 --> 11:33.561
- Should I get it?
- Yeah, see who it is.

11:33.644 --> 11:36.272
What I do with my time
is none of your damn business.

11:36.355 --> 11:38.941
And when I ask you to do something,
you fucking do it.

11:39.024 --> 11:41.402
I'm your aunt, I'm your elder,
and I will beat you down.

11:41.485 --> 11:44.613
It ain't like you don't know
we supposed to have a security sys...

11:48.450 --> 11:51.370
What the fuck you doing here?

11:51.453 --> 11:54.915
Don't just stand there. Invite a nigga in.

11:54.999 --> 11:58.002
Next time I ring your bell,
you better hurry up and let me in.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.421
Next time you in my face, gargle.

12:00.504 --> 12:03.340
Oh, you a wild girl, Vaneeta.

12:03.424 --> 12:07.553
- Why'd you bring him here?
- He brought me. It was a surprise.

12:07.636 --> 12:11.181
- I didn't even know about this place.
- I know everything.

12:11.265 --> 12:12.725
Now, come over here.

12:12.808 --> 12:15.978
I don't want my soldiers
fraternising with the help.

12:17.980 --> 12:21.191
This is not me.
How could you think I'd like this?

12:21.275 --> 12:23.110
The fun's just getting started.

12:23.986 --> 12:26.447
- Now, where's our crop?
- It ain't ready.

12:26.530 --> 12:27.948
What you mean, it ain't ready?

12:28.032 --> 12:30.701
Y'all had a minute to get
this place up and running.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.745
Y'all got more excuses than a nigger in court.

12:32.828 --> 12:36.373
Pull it up, dry it out! Let's hit the streets!
Come on, let's move, now!

12:36.457 --> 12:39.960
Look, I told you.
It ain't ready.

12:41.003 --> 12:43.214
- Can't force nature.
- Oh, no?

12:43.297 --> 12:44.340
Hm...

12:44.423 --> 12:46.342
Seedless watermelon,

12:46.425 --> 12:50.888
broccoflower, aprium -
half apricot, half plum.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.556
Bullshit, you can't force nature.

12:52.640 --> 12:56.435
They even got a hypoallergenic cat
you can buy for four grand.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.274
- Knock over a plant.
- What?

13:03.442 --> 13:06.278
You need to learn to wreck shit.

13:06.362 --> 13:07.988
Let them know you mean business.

13:08.072 --> 13:10.491
Look, I'm all for wrecking shit to make a point.

13:10.574 --> 13:12.952
I do it with my kids.
But we're wrecking our own shit.

13:13.035 --> 13:15.788
Don't argue with me.
Just go over there and bust some shit up

13:15.871 --> 13:18.582
before I have to bust one of them up,
and wait for my cue.

13:20.084 --> 13:22.753
So, y'all motherfuckers think we playing, huh?

13:22.836 --> 13:25.339
I want my fucking crop in a month!

13:34.598 --> 13:36.725
- Now, do it right!
- Fine.

13:41.814 --> 13:44.483
All right, Louis. Show's over.

13:45.651 --> 13:49.113
You'll get your fucking crops,
and then we're done with your ass.

13:50.865 --> 13:54.076
Your grandmother always said
you were a bad seed.

13:54.577 --> 13:57.746
Now look at you. Full-grown shit bush.

13:57.830 --> 14:00.207
You old fool.

14:00.291 --> 14:03.460
It's over when I say it's over.

14:11.594 --> 14:13.762
All right, Nancy, let's go.

14:17.182 --> 14:20.895
Did you fucking apologise?
What's the matter with you?

14:20.978 --> 14:24.356
Listen, thug means
never having to say you're sorry.

14:28.485 --> 14:31.614
An underground canal
will carry sewage through Agrestic

14:31.697 --> 14:34.200
to our water treatment plant in Van Nuys.

14:34.283 --> 14:36.660
Are you coming to the party later?

14:36.744 --> 14:39.330
- Yes.
- Well, how about being my date?

14:39.413 --> 14:42.166
- We're ready to break ground.
- What do you want?

14:42.249 --> 14:44.793
You ever watch a man
play with a big machine?

14:44.877 --> 14:48.130
Not for a long time,
but you still didn't answer my question.

14:48.881 --> 14:52.176
Get over your issues, Celia. I want you.

14:52.259 --> 14:56.055
Let's just start with the date,
and we'll take it from there.

14:57.139 --> 14:59.600
OK, stop, stop! Stop right there.

14:59.683 --> 15:01.518
- Can I help you?
- Mr. Groff?

15:01.602 --> 15:02.811
- Dumb name.
- And you are?

15:02.895 --> 15:05.648
Warden Shlapobersky
from the Wildlife Commission.

15:05.731 --> 15:10.152
A mammal on our endangered species list
may lose its habitat with this new construction.

15:10.236 --> 15:13.739
We insist that you halt all work
until we've investigated the matter.

15:13.822 --> 15:16.992
- Let me guess. The dirt shrew.
- Yeah, yeah.

15:17.076 --> 15:19.703
Looks like a jackrabbit and a big rat fucked.

15:19.787 --> 15:21.914
You're not getting anything else from me.

15:21.997 --> 15:24.542
- The store is closed.
- Well, this project is on hold

15:24.625 --> 15:29.213
until there's a full report on the dirt shrew,
and I'm referring to the endangered animal,

15:29.296 --> 15:32.341
not the one in the hard hat and heels
who's been sucking your dick.

15:38.806 --> 15:42.017
- I said, "Don't let me move!"
- You're big. You're a large man.

15:42.101 --> 15:44.853
- It's hard to keep you in one place.
- I don't let you move.

15:44.937 --> 15:47.690
Shut the fuck up! I ain't talking to you!

15:47.773 --> 15:50.609
Tell him to shut his fucking mouth.

15:50.693 --> 15:52.570
Shut your fucking mouth, Marvin!

15:53.904 --> 15:57.199
That's good. That was really good.

15:59.076 --> 16:02.037
Hey, listen, if you don't really need me,

16:02.121 --> 16:03.956
I need to go to the flower mart

16:04.039 --> 16:07.459
to pick up some Casablanca Lilies
for my boss's party.

16:07.543 --> 16:10.838
I hear that all the wedding planners
get there early and buy them all.

16:10.921 --> 16:13.799
He'll kill me if this party tanks.

16:13.883 --> 16:15.926
You're being hyperbolic.

16:16.969 --> 16:19.263
I don't think he'll actually kill you.

16:20.556 --> 16:23.601
But me... I'm a different matter.

16:27.104 --> 16:29.106
- Put your hand on my shoulder.
- Why?

16:29.189 --> 16:31.025
It helps me pay attention to my form! Do it!

16:32.568 --> 16:34.069
Review time.

16:35.779 --> 16:37.573
What did we learn last night?

16:37.656 --> 16:38.782
Er...

16:38.866 --> 16:41.660
Lesson... Make an impact.

16:46.540 --> 16:48.250
I'm a drug dealer,

16:49.501 --> 16:52.213
and I'm great at what I do.

16:53.422 --> 16:56.675
- Don't you want to be great at what you do?
- Yeah.

16:58.093 --> 17:00.846
You been learning good, novice.

17:00.930 --> 17:02.890
But you got to do better.

17:02.973 --> 17:04.892
More money...

17:04.974 --> 17:06.227
Results...

17:06.310 --> 17:07.728
Faster.

17:17.613 --> 17:19.698
Now, go get those lilies.

17:23.993 --> 17:27.080
Hi, we haven't officially met. I'm Tara.

17:27.540 --> 17:29.041
Silas.

17:29.124 --> 17:31.585
Community service boy.

17:32.711 --> 17:35.297
I saw you sell Mr Mertes an eighth.

17:35.881 --> 17:37.299
Nice cross.

17:37.925 --> 17:40.302
Yes, well, I'm tight with the Lord.

17:40.386 --> 17:43.305
So, he's aware you can spot an eighth
from across the room?

17:43.389 --> 17:47.560
He is. In fact, he likes it when I get stoned.

17:47.643 --> 17:49.728
We have some great talks.

17:50.729 --> 17:52.982
Are you gonna tell on me?

17:53.065 --> 17:55.276
Not if you smoke me out.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.320
Right now?

17:58.404 --> 18:01.991
Er... Tomorrow. Same time.

18:02.658 --> 18:03.951
Gladwell Park.

18:04.952 --> 18:08.122
Smoke me out,
and I'll tell you about my friend.

18:09.331 --> 18:12.501
- Jesus.
- That's the one.

18:19.008 --> 18:22.887
Hey, hey, go easy on the jumbo shrimp.
Those are expensive.

18:22.970 --> 18:25.055
Dumb name can afford it.

18:26.557 --> 18:28.309
Hey, hey, shh!

18:28.392 --> 18:30.519
You got to let it go, man.

18:30.603 --> 18:33.981
Love the food, pal.
Want you to give a friend of mine a call.

18:34.064 --> 18:36.859
We're shooting a movie
in one of our empty houses.

18:36.942 --> 18:39.361
Needs a caterer. You'll thank me later.

18:39.445 --> 18:41.280
Hey, you did a good job.

18:42.281 --> 18:45.534
How much of the budget
did you stuff in your bra?

18:47.620 --> 18:49.079
Er, half.

18:49.163 --> 18:51.582
- Can I feel?
- No.

18:51.665 --> 18:54.501
In that case, next time, spring for a hall.

18:54.585 --> 18:58.505
Now, you see that fellow,
Baldy, the white-haired clown?

18:58.589 --> 19:02.218
Let me know when he's good and shitfaced.
I need his signature on something.

19:02.301 --> 19:04.178
And that woman in the Chanel knockoff.

19:04.261 --> 19:06.513
She needs the recipe
for the stuffed mushrooms.

19:06.597 --> 19:09.183
She's a big fan. She's also someone's wife.

19:11.560 --> 19:16.941
I need to borrow her for a minute.
You are going to talk to me.

19:18.984 --> 19:21.529
In, in. OK, listen.

19:22.988 --> 19:26.617
I know that we're in the middle
of the party and everything,

19:26.700 --> 19:29.620
but, Nancy, you have got to stop hating me.

19:29.703 --> 19:32.373
- I don't hate you.
- But you do.

19:32.456 --> 19:35.626
Celia, I don't. Listen, you got me a job.

19:35.709 --> 19:39.296
What's done is done.
I don't want to fight anymore. Let's just leave it.

19:40.589 --> 19:41.715
Good, then.

19:41.799 --> 19:43.759
- OK?
- I'm glad.

19:43.842 --> 19:46.262
- Great.
- God damn it!

19:46.345 --> 19:49.014
These fucking ankle-strap shoes.

19:53.686 --> 19:56.522
Has Sullivan ever talked about me?

19:57.064 --> 19:59.483
- What?
- Has he ever mentioned me?

19:59.567 --> 20:01.610
Er...

20:01.694 --> 20:06.073
- Yes. He calls you the hot redhead.
- Are you sure he was talking about me?

20:06.156 --> 20:09.076
Because I've always thought I was more...

20:09.159 --> 20:12.913
auburn with, like,
strawberry-blonde highlights.

20:12.997 --> 20:15.708
He was definitely talking about you.
He likes you.

20:15.791 --> 20:17.877
You should go be with him.

20:17.960 --> 20:20.838
There you are.
Matt Keefe doesn't have a drink in his hand.

20:20.921 --> 20:24.091
Hey, man, what's up? Did you tell
some woman in a Chanel knockoff

20:24.174 --> 20:26.093
she could go through my recipe box?

20:26.176 --> 20:27.928
Out, out, all of you, all of you!

20:28.012 --> 20:30.848
This room is off limits! OK? Out. Get out.

20:30.931 --> 20:32.933
- I'm really glad...
- Get out!

20:36.145 --> 20:39.356
- What are you doing down here?
- These little smokies are like crack.

20:39.440 --> 20:42.526
Well, don't eat too many of them.
They're filled with nitrates.

20:42.610 --> 20:45.279
- I really have to talk to you.
- Well, bad time.

20:45.362 --> 20:47.573
We'll talk later. I promise.

20:55.456 --> 20:58.959
- You look beautiful tonight.
- Thank you.

20:59.043 --> 21:02.546
- I want to thank you for being my date.
- You're welcome.

21:15.935 --> 21:18.687
- You know I'm gonna keep trying.
- Good.

21:46.465 --> 21:47.800
Who are you?

21:49.843 --> 21:51.554
A sheep in God's flock.

21:52.304 --> 21:53.973
Let me hear you say baa!

21:54.765 --> 21:55.766
Baa!

21:58.143 --> 21:59.603
You want a drink?

21:59.687 --> 22:02.606
Mr Johnson gave it to me
after he confused me with his war buddy.

22:02.690 --> 22:04.233
I don't drink.

22:04.900 --> 22:07.111
Wine's OK because Jesus drank that,

22:07.194 --> 22:10.155
but other than wine, I don't drink.

22:11.699 --> 22:15.452
- But you smoke.
- Only weed, not cigarettes.

22:16.704 --> 22:17.872
Never cigarettes.

22:17.955 --> 22:21.792
You don't drink,
you don't smoke cigarettes.

22:21.876 --> 22:26.714
- Let me guess, you don't have sex either?
- Not until I'm married.

22:31.302 --> 22:34.638
How can you be all into Jesus
and still smoke weed?

22:36.515 --> 22:39.101
Because pot is natural.

22:40.227 --> 22:41.770
It's not processed.

22:41.854 --> 22:45.024
It's made by God himself, so it's spiritual.

22:45.774 --> 22:48.360
It elevates you, opens your mind.

22:49.361 --> 22:52.031
That's what God's love is all about.

22:53.949 --> 22:56.410
- I can see your boner.
- Fuck.

22:57.786 --> 23:02.208
Don't be embarrassed.
I mean, that's part of God's love, too.

23:02.958 --> 23:04.335
Once you're married.

23:04.418 --> 23:07.588
You're right.
My virginity is for my husband.

23:09.089 --> 23:11.383
But that doesn't mean
we can't have some fun.

23:11.467 --> 23:16.013
<i># Jesus will dance while we drink his wine</i>

23:16.096 --> 23:21.060
<i># With soldiers and thieves
and a sword in his side</i>

23:22.770 --> 23:25.731
<i># We will bejoy and we will be right... #</i>

23:27.942 --> 23:29.318
Oh!

23:35.699 --> 23:38.619
- You OK?
- Of course.

23:39.537 --> 23:41.455
I was just at this party last night

23:41.539 --> 23:44.792
and felt up on two big-booty freaks, that's all.

23:44.875 --> 23:47.670
- They kept a brother up all night.
- I'm coming!

23:47.753 --> 23:50.464
Keeping up with my heart rate,
swinging my arms.

23:50.548 --> 23:54.343
You gonna let him beat you?
Come on! First one to the next tree wins!

23:57.930 --> 23:59.181
U- Turn?

24:01.267 --> 24:03.644
U- Turn! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Marvin!

24:06.480 --> 24:10.526
- What is it? What's wrong with him?
- He got high blood pressure.

24:10.609 --> 24:12.570
I saw some people at the bottom of the hill.

24:12.653 --> 24:15.114
Ask them if they have a banana.
He needs potassium!

24:15.197 --> 24:18.033
I'll stay here. You'll be OK. U-Turn.

24:28.794 --> 24:30.713
You bitch-ass bitch.

24:33.382 --> 24:34.800
I got you now.

24:37.636 --> 24:38.971
Oh, yeah.

24:41.223 --> 24:44.894
This is for saying I was too stupid
to be your second in command.

24:46.228 --> 24:50.024
And this is for laughing at me
for going to Dreamgirls,

24:50.774 --> 24:53.235
and for never letting me count the money.

24:53.319 --> 24:54.904
You gonna die, motherfucker.

25:08.667 --> 25:10.002
U- Turn!

25:11.629 --> 25:15.007
- Don't die on me, cuz!
- No one has any bananas.

25:15.090 --> 25:17.927
We need to get him out of here.
Let's pick him up.

25:18.010 --> 25:19.637
U- Turn's dead!

25:21.805 --> 25:25.226
He's dead!
What am I supposed to do now, man?

25:25.309 --> 25:28.062
What the fuck am I supposed to do, man?

25:28.145 --> 25:32.358
<i># I was lost in the lakes</i>

25:33.025 --> 25:35.444
<i># And the shapes</i>

25:36.612 --> 25:38.030
<i># That your body makes</i>

25:38.113 --> 25:40.699
<i># I could tell then and there</i>

25:40.783 --> 25:43.494
<i># We were formed from the clay</i>

25:43.577 --> 25:45.746
<i># And came from the rocks</i>

25:45.829 --> 25:48.749
<i># For the earth to display</i>

25:48.832 --> 25:53.546
<i># They told me to be careful up there</i>

25:53.629 --> 25:57.216
<i># Where the wind blows a venomous rage</i>

25:57.299 --> 25:58.717
<i># Through your hair</i>

25:58.801 --> 26:03.430
<i># They told me to be careful up there</i>

26:03.514 --> 26:08.727
<i># Where the wind rages through your hair #</i>
