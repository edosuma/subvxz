WEBVTT

02:12.716 --> 02:14.677
Feels like I’m signing
my life away.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.428
No paint,
no holes in the walls

02:16.512 --> 02:18.639
and nothing can be suspended
from the ceiling.

02:18.764 --> 02:20.266
Curtains?

02:20.349 --> 02:23.352
You know, Thomas, the owners
don’t rent to just anyone.

02:23.435 --> 02:24.603
This is happening.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.021
THOMAS:
Wait, Pippa, don’t move.

02:26.105 --> 02:29.358
Can you please take our picture?

02:29.441 --> 02:30.693
Thank you.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.611
-Hey.
-

02:32.736 --> 02:34.655
-

02:34.738 --> 02:37.616
-

02:40.244 --> 02:42.079
-Hey, turkey.
-Hey, chicken.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.289
What’s up?

02:43.372 --> 02:44.582
Nothing much.
What’s up with you?

02:44.665 --> 02:46.458
So, we’re really
gonna do this, huh?

02:46.584 --> 02:48.294
-Seems that way. Yeah.
-Yeah.

02:48.419 --> 02:49.920
-It’s a big step.
-Huge step. Ooh.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.464
It’s really big, and if this
doesn’t work out...

02:52.590 --> 02:54.592
-Ooh, woof.
-It’s gonna suck.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.886
Maybe we should just
call it off now.

02:56.969 --> 02:58.345
Oh, yeah, maybe just, like,

02:58.429 --> 03:00.180
-quit while we’re ahead? Yeah.
-Just-just, yeah.

03:00.264 --> 03:01.891
-Nice meeting you. Yeah, ni...
-Nice-nice-nice talking to you.

03:01.974 --> 03:03.350
I’ll take half of my stuff.

03:03.434 --> 03:05.603
And I will take the other half
of the stuff.

03:05.728 --> 03:07.479
-Yep. That make sense?
-

03:07.563 --> 03:09.148
Babe...

03:09.273 --> 03:11.025
this is our home.

03:11.108 --> 03:14.069
I get to live here with you.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.451
Not yet.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.078
Right. Sorry, sorry.

03:44.475 --> 03:48.771
was violet...

03:48.896 --> 03:50.314
Oh, what is this?

03:50.439 --> 03:51.982
-It’s chlorophyll water.
-What?

03:52.066 --> 03:54.985
Chlorophyll water.
It’s the secret to a long life.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.445
I will stick to
my gewürztraminer,

03:56.528 --> 03:57.821
thank you very much.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.240
Okay, well, stick to your
"ga-ga-bosh-bana-miner."

04:01.492 --> 04:02.826
Okay, wait.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.745
I know we just
moved in together,

04:04.828 --> 04:06.956
but can we talk about kids?

04:07.039 --> 04:08.290
-Kids?
-Yes.

04:08.374 --> 04:09.750
Like, it’s really important
that we have

04:09.875 --> 04:11.502
-this conversation right now.
-Okay.

04:11.627 --> 04:13.170
Can we...

04:13.253 --> 04:15.214
not have kids
for at least four years?

04:15.297 --> 04:17.633
-Yes. Geez...

04:17.716 --> 04:19.051
-Yeah?
-Yes. Hell yes.

04:19.134 --> 04:20.636
-Ugh.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.429
-Hey, don’t act so...
-You scared the shit out of me.

04:22.513 --> 04:25.265
Wait, but seriously,
I was thinking about how

04:25.349 --> 04:28.519
I basically spent my entire life
in school, right?

04:28.644 --> 04:29.812
As long as I’ve known you.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.105
Yeah, like, you spent
your early 20s

04:31.188 --> 04:32.856
playing in some
shitty punk clubs

04:32.940 --> 04:34.733
and doing God knows what.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.026
Drugs.

04:36.110 --> 04:37.778
And I spent mine in the corner

04:37.861 --> 04:41.532
of some stuffy medical library
studying till 2:00 a.m.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.033
-Right.
-So I don’t want some

04:43.117 --> 04:46.120
gooey toddler to come along
and just mess up

04:46.245 --> 04:48.789
the last few years
of being rebellious.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.374
Yeah. You know what,

04:50.499 --> 04:52.668
I-I’ve been thinking about
rebellion, too, in my own way.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.586
You’re about to say
something stupid right now.

04:54.670 --> 04:55.879
No, no, I...

04:55.963 --> 04:58.424
Well, you might think
I’m un poco loco,

04:58.507 --> 05:01.385
but I was thinking about
taking up the accordion.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.303
No. Really?

05:03.387 --> 05:05.014
What-what are you
talking about, then?

05:05.097 --> 05:06.932
I want to wake up Sunday morning

05:07.057 --> 05:09.101
with an awful hangover
that reminds me

05:09.184 --> 05:11.895
of all the terrible decisions
I made the night before.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.480
That is what I’m talking about.

05:13.564 --> 05:15.399
I’m here for it.
Hey, you deserve it.

05:15.482 --> 05:18.110
You deserve all the hangovers
in the world, Pippa.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.319
-I do.
-You do.

05:19.403 --> 05:20.779
-I do.
-Yes, you do.

05:20.863 --> 05:23.532
To making wonderful,
terrible decisions.

05:23.615 --> 05:26.285
To wonderful,
terrible decisions.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.788
Come here.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.877
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

05:46.138 --> 05:48.307
THOMAS:
Oh, check out those two.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.851
What is he, like,
a photographer or something?

05:50.934 --> 05:52.895
PIPPA:
Looks like it.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.188
Wow.

05:54.271 --> 05:57.900
You can see right in.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.485
THOMAS:
It’s a nice pla...

05:59.568 --> 06:01.361
Oh, oh, kissy kissy.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.740
THOMAS:
Aw, they’re in love.

06:05.783 --> 06:07.409
PIPPA:
Mm, it’s getting spicy.

06:11.121 --> 06:12.790
-PIPPA: Oh. Oh.
-THOMAS: Oh, that man is

06:12.915 --> 06:14.958
taking off her clothes.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.210
PIPPA:
Um, Thomas...

06:16.335 --> 06:17.503
THOMAS:
That is happening.

06:17.586 --> 06:18.962
-PIPPA: Thomas.
-What?

06:19.088 --> 06:20.756
I don’t think we should
spy on our neighbors.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.883
No, we’re not spying.
We’re just...

06:22.966 --> 06:25.385
looking outside our window,
and they happen to be

06:25.511 --> 06:27.137
in our field of vision.

06:27.262 --> 06:29.640
-Oh, oh, oh!
-PIPPA: O-Okay.

06:29.765 --> 06:32.101
They have to know
that people can see in.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.311
-THOMAS: Exactly.
-Like, they have to know that.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.313
THOMAS:
Have to know. Have to know.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.732
Is he about to do
what I think he’s about to do?

06:38.816 --> 06:40.067
PIPPA:
Yep.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.985
THOMAS:
That is some good content.

06:42.069 --> 06:45.864
Okay. Thomas, we’re officially
being creepy weirdos.

06:45.989 --> 06:47.116
-Don’t you agree?
-No.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.409
What? They-they want us to look.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.746
But we’ll stop
because you want me to.

06:52.830 --> 06:53.956
Thank you.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.624
-It’s our first night.
-Right, right.

06:55.707 --> 06:58.544
Let’s give our new neighbors
some privacy.

06:58.627 --> 07:00.796
Oh, they’re fucking now. Okay.

07:00.879 --> 07:02.798
Thomas, come on, perv.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.591
Okay, okay, okay.

07:04.675 --> 07:06.135
Go get it.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.428
Go get it, boy.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.725
So...

07:54.808 --> 07:57.186
I got you a little...

08:00.105 --> 08:02.608
-Thomas?
-

08:02.733 --> 08:04.484
Babe?

08:08.447 --> 08:10.532
Thomas.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.827
Thomas.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.495
Sex.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.028
ARI: So, congratulations
are in order.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.072
-PIPPA What’d I do?
-ARI: You, nothing.

08:50.197 --> 08:53.242
Me, I’m on day three
of a social media blackout.

08:53.325 --> 08:55.285
No Insta, no Twitter.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.537
Joni and I pledged
to go an entire month.

08:57.663 --> 08:59.289
-PIPPA: Mazel tov, Ari.
-Mm-hmm.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.874
I just read that couples
who decrease

09:00.958 --> 09:02.584
their amount of screen time

09:02.668 --> 09:05.379
can double or triple the amount
of sex they have a month.

09:05.462 --> 09:06.964
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.466
Uh, but what do they look at
when they masturbate?

09:09.591 --> 09:12.719
Oh, my God,
how is cohabitation going?

09:12.803 --> 09:15.472
The weirdest thing
happened last night.

09:15.597 --> 09:18.016
-This couple, our neighbors
across the way, -Mm-hmm.

09:18.100 --> 09:21.061
they were totally doing it,
and we could see right in.

09:21.186 --> 09:23.230
ARI:
Oof magoof. How ugly were they?

09:23.355 --> 09:24.815
PIPPA: They’re not.
They were, like, gorgeous.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.316
-ARI: So,

09:26.400 --> 09:28.527
you pulled up a chair,
popped some popcorn,

09:28.610 --> 09:30.112
broke out the binoculars?

09:30.195 --> 09:31.530
-No.
-Why not?

09:31.655 --> 09:34.157
Just because someone is
allegedly allowing you

09:34.241 --> 09:37.035
to look in on their lives
doesn’t mean it’s okay to watch.

09:37.119 --> 09:39.162
Hmm. Mm, you are 1,000% wrong
about that.

09:39.288 --> 09:41.081
It is entirely acceptable
to look.

09:41.206 --> 09:43.292
I mean, it sounds like
they’re exhibitionists.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.751
Doubtful.

09:44.876 --> 09:46.420
If they are exhibitionists,
then watching them--

09:46.503 --> 09:48.463
it’s, like, the polite thing
to do, Pippa.

09:48.547 --> 09:50.465
I’ll see you at lunch.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.634
So long, creep.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.597
PIPPA: You’re gonna see
so much better after this.

09:57.723 --> 09:59.558
Just relax, okay?

10:01.351 --> 10:05.105
I’ve done 40 of these a week
for the past 20 years,

10:05.230 --> 10:07.190
and well over half of them
have gone right.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.859
Just kidding, of course.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.069
Cannula, please.

10:11.194 --> 10:12.404
20 years.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.448
Yeah, and I’m still trying
to figure out

10:14.531 --> 10:16.199
what I want to be
when I grow up.

10:16.325 --> 10:18.618
-

10:18.744 --> 10:20.287
Okay.

10:20.412 --> 10:23.165
In three, two,

10:23.248 --> 10:25.000
-and...
-

10:28.628 --> 10:31.340
Bonjour. Hi.
This is Pippa from L’optique.

10:31.423 --> 10:33.300
-Your glasses are ready.
-DR. SATO: Pippa?

10:33.383 --> 10:35.719
Uh, we’re open till 6:00.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.721
You’re welcome. Bye.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.973
What is this?

10:40.098 --> 10:43.268
DR. SATO: So, in Japan,
birds are described as

10:43.352 --> 10:46.355
"two eyes with wings,"
and for good reason.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.106
Their acuity is so strong

10:48.190 --> 10:50.150
that from the top
of an eight-story building

10:50.233 --> 10:53.653
they can pick out a single ant
crawling on the sidewalk below.

10:53.737 --> 10:55.489
Uh-huh.

10:55.572 --> 10:56.907
Why are you telling her this?

10:56.990 --> 10:58.700
Well, it’s a little
housewarming present.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.952
-Oh.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.124
DR. SATO:
When you see birds

11:06.249 --> 11:08.377
drinking from this
outside your window,

11:08.460 --> 11:10.504
let it be a little reminder
of how imperfect

11:10.587 --> 11:12.339
our own species’ vision is.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.091
You and I,

11:14.174 --> 11:17.636
all we’re doing here
is making it slightly better.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.930
PIPPA
Thank you.

11:20.055 --> 11:21.723
I want a present.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.897
Hey, babe.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.191
-Hi.
-Voilà.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.068
Thomas, this is so cute.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.320
THOMAS: We kind of look
like Bert and Ernie.

11:36.321 --> 11:40.200
What’s going on with our
friendly next-door neighbors?

11:40.283 --> 11:42.911
Really?
This is gonna be a thing?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.621
THOMAS:
Look. They’re just like us.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.331
PIPPA
They’re nothing like us.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.125
They’re way cooler.

11:48.250 --> 11:49.167
Yeah.

11:49.251 --> 11:50.752
Hey, stop being so obvious.

11:50.836 --> 11:53.505
-Oh, okay. Secret time.
-Ooh.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.173
Ooh.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.510
How do we become their friends?

11:58.593 --> 12:00.846
You want to become BFFs
with the neighbors

12:00.929 --> 12:03.390
-we now seem to be stalking?
-Yeah. Why not?

12:03.473 --> 12:06.101
I bet that sake he’s drinking
is top-shelf.

12:06.184 --> 12:07.894
He could pour me some,

12:07.978 --> 12:09.855
and I could pretend
to know the difference.

12:09.938 --> 12:12.107
And then she could show you
all the cute boutiques

12:12.190 --> 12:13.608
to shop at in the neighborhood.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.819
Yeah, ’cause all girls do
is shop.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.363
Okay, fine. I’ll-I’ll learn
about the boutiques, then.

12:18.447 --> 12:19.906
-Shit.
-

12:19.990 --> 12:21.366
What are their names?

12:21.491 --> 12:24.619
PIPPA:
Uh, she’s definitely a Margot.

12:24.703 --> 12:27.038
THOMAS: Oh, yeah, of course.
She’s clearly a Margot.

12:27.164 --> 12:30.000
PIPPA:
And that’s... Brent.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.751
THOMAS
Well, maybe Brent can also

12:31.877 --> 12:33.628
tell me how to sculpt
my body hair.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.672
Caught a glimpse
of his pubes yesterday.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.466
They were exquisitely manscaped.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.134
Would you ever want me
to do that?

12:39.217 --> 12:40.510
PIPPA:
Shave your pubes?

12:40.635 --> 12:42.012
-THOMAS: Yeah.
-PIPPA: No.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.389
W-Wouldn’t they grow back
prickly or something?

12:44.514 --> 12:45.807
THOMAS
"Prickly."

12:45.891 --> 12:47.142
PIPPA:
Wait.

12:47.225 --> 12:49.227
Is... is he choking?

12:49.352 --> 12:50.437
Oh, shit.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.147
-That guy can’t breathe.
-PIPPA: I know.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.940
-THOMAS: And she can’t see him.
-I-I know. What do we do?

12:54.024 --> 12:56.276
-THOMAS: Okay, here we go.
-Oh. Good, good, good. Yes.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.778
-N-No, no.
-THOMAS: No! Go to the kitchen!

12:58.862 --> 12:59.988
The kitchen!

13:00.071 --> 13:01.364
Take off your headphones,
girlfriend!

13:01.490 --> 13:03.950
Ugh, my...
This is, like, an emergency.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.536
Okay, uh, I-I should...
call 911?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.288
No, you’re... they’re not gonna
get there fast enough.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.332
-You need to go over there.
-Okay, but then they’ll know

13:10.415 --> 13:11.583
that we were spying.

13:11.708 --> 13:12.834
Yeah, but then
he won’t be dead. Go!

13:12.918 --> 13:14.461
Shit. Okay, right. Shit.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.713
-I have to go over there?
-Go!

13:16.838 --> 13:19.299
Okay. Yeah, yeah.
All right, all right.

13:21.510 --> 13:23.637
PIPPA: Wait! Thomas, come back,
come back, come back.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.055
What? What?

13:25.180 --> 13:26.598
-PIPPA: No, not like that.
-No, no, no.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.433
THOMAS: What are you doing?
No, no, no, no.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.143
-No. Come on. Harder, harder,
harder. -No! What is she doing?

13:30.227 --> 13:32.229
-PIPPA: Oh, come on.
-Come on. What are you doing?

13:32.354 --> 13:34.439
-Oh, look!
-Come on!

13:34.564 --> 13:35.982
-Look!
-Like this!

13:36.066 --> 13:37.901
-THOMAS: Yeah! Yeah, go!
-Yeah! That’s right!

13:38.026 --> 13:39.819
-PIPPA: You got this, girl!
-Go, go, go! Go, go, go, go!

13:39.903 --> 13:41.488
-Push, push, push, push.
-Come on. You got this!

13:41.571 --> 13:43.114
-There you go. There you go.
-You got this!

13:43.198 --> 13:44.449
THOMAS: There you go.
There you go. There you go.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.201
-Yeah! Yes!
-Oh, my gosh!

13:46.326 --> 13:48.078
-Yeah!

13:48.161 --> 13:49.579
-We did it!
-

13:49.704 --> 13:51.081
PIPPA:
Oh, my God, we did it.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.083
-THOMAS: We did. Oh, my God.
-We did it.

13:53.208 --> 13:54.584
-

13:54.668 --> 13:56.378
PIPPA: He just spit up
a spicy tuna roll.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.088
Kinky.

13:58.171 --> 14:01.216
-Ew. No, ew! Ew!
-Ooh...

17:01.479 --> 17:04.399
So, this might be
a little problematic.

17:04.482 --> 17:07.944
Why? They know
we can see in, so why not?

17:09.446 --> 17:10.739
Wait.

17:10.822 --> 17:13.158
Somebody’s got some company.

17:13.241 --> 17:15.160
THOMAS: I think this guy’s
pretty successful.

17:15.243 --> 17:17.495
PIPPA: Yeah, he doesn’t
do commercials.

17:17.579 --> 17:19.080
THOMAS:
That’s a sore spot, baby.

17:19.164 --> 17:20.457
-PIPPA: Sorry.
-

17:20.540 --> 17:21.958
PIPPA:
Ooh.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.460
THOMAS: Oh, I think
she was there this afternoon.

17:23.585 --> 17:26.129
-Can I take a look?
-Yeah.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.341
-Wow. These get so close.
-PIPPA: I know, right?

17:30.425 --> 17:33.261
-They were only a hundred bucks.
-Only? Did you negotiate?

17:33.344 --> 17:34.888
PIPPA:
No. Should I have?

17:35.013 --> 17:36.973
Yeah, you probably
could’ve got ’em for 50.

17:37.098 --> 17:38.433
Man.

17:38.516 --> 17:41.644
THOMAS: Fun fact-- this guy
touched her butt earlier.

17:44.022 --> 17:46.316
PIPPA:
Oh, what’s he doing?

17:46.399 --> 17:48.526
THOMAS:
Impromptu photo shoot?

17:48.651 --> 17:50.612
Here.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.950
PIPPA
It’s-a me, Mario.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.079
PIPPA
I like her overalls, though.

18:00.205 --> 18:01.790
-Oh, sh... Whoa.
-THOMAS: What’s happening?

18:01.915 --> 18:04.083
-PIPPA: What just happened?
-What’s happening?

18:04.209 --> 18:06.628
THOMAS:
"Hello, world. I do push-ups."

18:06.711 --> 18:09.506
Yeah, me too, bub, sometimes.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.966
PIPPA:
Uh, whoa, whoa.

18:12.050 --> 18:14.052
THOMAS: "Take off your shirt.
That’s what friends do."

18:14.135 --> 18:15.470
PIPPA:
"Best friends?"

18:15.553 --> 18:16.846
THOMAS: "Yeah,
we’re best friends forever."

18:16.930 --> 18:17.972
PIPPA:
"Aw."

18:18.097 --> 18:20.016
-"Take off your clothes."
-"Okay."

18:24.521 --> 18:26.523
PIPPA:
Whoa, this is so sus.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.608
THOMAS:
He’s buttering her up.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.610
-PIPPA: Ooh. Clink!
-THOMAS: Clink.

18:30.693 --> 18:32.862
THOMAS:
Hey-yo. Boobs.

18:32.946 --> 18:36.241
-Stop.
-Boobs, babe. There’s boobs.

18:38.201 --> 18:39.661
PIPPA:
Do you think she wants it?

18:39.744 --> 18:41.371
THOMAS:
I don’t know.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.665
Oh, I think she wants it.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.876
What if Margot comes home?

18:46.960 --> 18:49.212
THOMAS:
I know. I know.

18:51.005 --> 18:53.049
Are we bad people
for watching this?

18:53.174 --> 18:54.801
No.

18:56.344 --> 18:58.805
THOMAS: This guy gets
a lot of action.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.015
PIPPA:
Hmm.

19:01.099 --> 19:03.768
Here. Keep watching.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.937
Okay.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.398
What are you doing?

19:08.481 --> 19:10.066
Taking your shirt off, babe.

19:13.945 --> 19:15.780
-Pippa.
-Take it off.

19:18.783 --> 19:20.660
And now what?

19:20.785 --> 19:22.203
Keep watching.

19:22.287 --> 19:23.955
THOMAS:
Okay.

19:35.925 --> 19:38.887
-What are they doing?
-Um...

19:39.971 --> 19:41.598
He’s kissing her neck and...

19:41.681 --> 19:43.349
What are we doing?
That’s so crazy.

19:43.474 --> 19:46.019
-Come on. Pay attention.
-This is crazy.

19:46.144 --> 19:48.313
Pay attention.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.150
Um... okay.

19:52.275 --> 19:54.152
He, uh...

19:57.280 --> 19:59.240
PIPPA:
Yeah?

20:05.121 --> 20:07.624
-PIPPA: Yeah?

20:10.376 --> 20:12.962
-

20:13.087 --> 20:14.923
My turn.

20:16.174 --> 20:19.010
-Come on, take ’em off.
-Yes, ma’am.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.684
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

20:32.523 --> 20:35.860
-

21:01.219 --> 21:03.096
I love you.

21:03.221 --> 21:04.681
Love you, too.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.474
Um, can you go a little faster?

21:06.557 --> 21:08.017
Yeah. Sure.

21:09.852 --> 21:11.729
Um, a little harder.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.564
-THOMAS: Like that?
-Yeah.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.200
I think I’m gonna...

21:24.283 --> 21:25.326
PIPPA: C-Can you...
can you just hold it?

21:25.410 --> 21:26.577
Yeah. Yeah, I’ll try.

21:26.703 --> 21:28.788
PIPPA:
Just slow down if you have to.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.208
No, I’m gonna...

21:44.846 --> 21:47.265
I’m sorry.

21:47.348 --> 21:49.267
I’m sorry.

21:49.350 --> 21:52.603
It’s okay.
Why are you apologizing?

21:56.816 --> 21:58.901
That was faster than usual.

21:59.027 --> 22:01.404
It was great.

22:01.487 --> 22:04.657
I mean, we’ve just never
done that before.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.245
-It was hot.
-

22:09.328 --> 22:11.289
All right, I’m gonna
get you a washcloth.

22:11.414 --> 22:13.666
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

23:44.132 --> 23:45.633
JONI:
I mean...

23:45.716 --> 23:47.426
it’s totally obvious.

23:47.552 --> 23:50.888
Margot is Brent’s wife,
serious girlfriend or whatever.

23:50.972 --> 23:52.390
And while she was out of town,

23:52.515 --> 23:54.559
Brent got thirsty
and straight-up cheated on her.

23:54.642 --> 23:57.270
-That’s my theory, too.
-ARI: Uh, okay.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.105
How can we be so sure?
I mean, maybe they’re just,

23:59.188 --> 24:01.399
like, in an open relationship
or something.

24:03.359 --> 24:05.444
Or maybe you’re projecting
your feelings

24:05.528 --> 24:07.029
about monogamy onto them?

24:07.155 --> 24:09.157
-But what are the odds
of that, though? -What?

24:09.240 --> 24:10.616
That they’re swingers or...

24:10.700 --> 24:12.618
Do people use the word
"swinger" anymore?

24:12.743 --> 24:16.164
Siri, what percentage of couples
are in an open relationship?

24:16.289 --> 24:17.999
You think Siri can answer
that question?

24:18.082 --> 24:20.501
SIRI: Blumstein and Schwartz
found that 15%

24:20.585 --> 24:21.878
of married couples share
an agreement

24:21.961 --> 24:24.338
that allows
for extramarital sex.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.923
15%?

24:26.007 --> 24:27.175
I’m legit impressed.

24:27.300 --> 24:28.718
And that’s an average,
I’m assuming.

24:28.801 --> 24:29.844
I bet that within
the greater metropolitan area

24:29.969 --> 24:31.220
it’s, like, way higher.

24:31.304 --> 24:32.763
I mean, this place is fuck city.

24:33.890 --> 24:35.349
But poor Margot.

24:35.433 --> 24:38.311
-Yes. It’s so wrong. -Yeah.
Poor Margot. -Poor Margot.

24:42.190 --> 24:45.484
I just wish we could hear what
they were saying to each other.

24:47.111 --> 24:48.738
Huh.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.615
-Huh.
-JONI: Brother.

24:50.698 --> 24:52.074
THOMAS:
Hmm. Sibling.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.159
What?

24:53.284 --> 24:54.911
Nothing.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.871
Joni, you just said, "Huh."

24:56.954 --> 24:58.331
Like, "Huh, I just had a thought

24:58.414 --> 25:00.208
that would be relevant
to this conversation."

25:01.500 --> 25:02.793
So...

25:02.919 --> 25:03.836
Okay.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.296
When Tommy and I
were in college,

25:05.379 --> 25:06.672
he used to have this huge crush

25:06.756 --> 25:08.883
on this super cute lit major
named Kylie.

25:08.966 --> 25:10.426
All these dorks wanted
to get with her,

25:10.551 --> 25:12.386
but none of them
had the balls to,

25:12.470 --> 25:14.305
you know, actually talk to her.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.641
-Please continue.

25:16.766 --> 25:18.351
One night, I went over
to smoke weed

25:18.434 --> 25:19.852
and watch Deep Blue Sea...

25:19.936 --> 25:21.604
-As one does.
-...and I discover

25:21.729 --> 25:23.981
they figured out how
to jerry-rig a laser pointer

25:24.065 --> 25:25.566
into a long-range microphone

25:25.650 --> 25:27.735
so that we could all
low-key listen in

25:27.818 --> 25:30.363
on Kylie’s private conversations

25:30.446 --> 25:32.949
in hopes that she would
miraculously be confessing

25:33.032 --> 25:34.742
-her love for one of them.
-Mon Dieu.

25:34.825 --> 25:37.995
-You were an accomplice to this?
-No.

25:38.079 --> 25:40.623
-Maybe. -Uh-huh.
-JONI: Okay, it was his idea,

25:40.748 --> 25:42.083
and he masterminded
the whole thing

25:42.166 --> 25:44.126
after watching a tutorial
on YouTube.

25:44.252 --> 25:45.544
What happened?

25:45.670 --> 25:47.463
-Nothing. Uh, it was...
-Uh, we turned it on.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.215
-No.
-And...

25:49.298 --> 25:51.342
the instant we got a signal,
everybody was crushed

25:51.467 --> 25:53.552
because, from the moaning
and the giggling,

25:53.636 --> 25:55.429
it became immediately apparent

25:55.554 --> 25:58.975
that Kylie and her roommate
were having a naked tickle party

25:59.058 --> 26:00.226
with Seth Gildenstein.

26:00.309 --> 26:02.603
-Gildenstein?
-It’s Gildensteen, yeah.

26:02.687 --> 26:04.313
Kylie was in the 15%.

26:04.438 --> 26:05.773
But a trivia note
on Seth Gildensteen--

26:05.856 --> 26:07.692
never was he seen
in a pair of shoes.

26:07.775 --> 26:09.318
-Sorry, what? -Like, he only
ever wore Rollerblades.

26:09.402 --> 26:11.654
Yeah, and still
somehow got laid.

26:11.737 --> 26:12.905
Laid a lot.

26:13.030 --> 26:14.991
Enough about Seth’s choice
of footwear.

26:15.992 --> 26:20.204
How does this
laser pointer thingy work?

26:22.039 --> 26:23.582
THOMAS:
Okay, class.

26:23.666 --> 26:26.669
Large picture windows
just like this one,

26:26.794 --> 26:28.963
when you make a noise,
they vibrate.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.298
Like, right now,
this is vibrating

26:30.381 --> 26:31.674
from the sound of my voice.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.968
So, if you shine
a laser through it,

26:34.051 --> 26:36.053
what do you think happens
to the beam?

26:36.178 --> 26:37.930
It also vibrates.

26:38.014 --> 26:39.682
Gold star for you. Exactly.

26:39.807 --> 26:42.893
The little dot of the laser
wiggles from the vibrations.

26:42.977 --> 26:45.021
And if you can capture
the pattern of the wiggling,

26:45.146 --> 26:48.357
you can translate that into
waveforms you can actually hear.

26:48.441 --> 26:49.984
Why haven’t we done this yet?

26:50.067 --> 26:52.445
Well, Pippa,
it’s probably illegal,

26:52.528 --> 26:54.363
and B, we can’t.

26:54.447 --> 26:55.865
I mean, if we shine a laser

26:55.990 --> 26:57.950
into their apartment,
it terminates.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.077
There’s no way to capture
the vibrations

27:00.202 --> 27:01.787
from across the street.

27:01.871 --> 27:04.665
In order to do that, we’d have
to bounce the beam back here.

27:04.749 --> 27:05.875
Wait, what?

27:06.000 --> 27:08.210
Unless we sneak
into Brent’s studio

27:08.336 --> 27:10.504
and perfectly place a mirror
behind his window,

27:10.588 --> 27:11.964
we’re out of luck.

27:12.089 --> 27:14.383
There’s a satyr
in their apartment.

27:14.508 --> 27:15.343
What?

27:15.426 --> 27:16.594
You know, a satyr.

27:16.677 --> 27:18.596
The Roman fertility spirit.
Look.

27:44.413 --> 27:46.582
I have a bad idea.

27:46.707 --> 27:49.377
THOMAS: I cannot believe
we’re doing this right now.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.379
This is exactly
what I’m talking about.

27:51.504 --> 27:53.381
Future us is gonna be
so impressed.

27:53.464 --> 27:55.674
Yeah, well, present-tense me
is freaking the fuck out.

27:55.758 --> 27:57.885
-Present-tense you
is also sober. -True.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.554
PIPPA: What’s the worst thing
that could happen?

28:23.619 --> 28:29.500
into the field for so long...

28:32.169 --> 28:33.796
PIPPA:
Oh, um...

28:35.965 --> 28:37.758
-PIPPA: Uh, uh...
-Yo!

28:37.883 --> 28:39.844
-Thomas!
-Yo!

28:40.594 --> 28:41.679
Hey, bro.

28:41.762 --> 28:44.098
-Thomas.
-Bro! Bro.

28:44.181 --> 28:45.766
-THOMAS: Hey.

28:47.893 --> 28:49.645
through your hair

28:54.275 --> 28:58.696
giving off heat, oh

29:11.959 --> 29:16.755
come over

29:20.301 --> 29:23.846
I can only stare

29:23.929 --> 29:26.557
-

29:26.640 --> 29:30.769
it’s pulling my heart down

29:32.730 --> 29:34.815
-

29:34.899 --> 29:39.069
it’s pulling my heart down

29:39.195 --> 29:42.448
-

29:49.246 --> 29:51.499
What the fuck was all that?

30:08.390 --> 30:09.975
To wonderful,
terrible decisions.

30:10.059 --> 30:11.810
To wonderful, terrible
decisions.

30:11.936 --> 30:13.103
Clink.

30:18.108 --> 30:20.236
-Is it chipped?
-No, you’re good. You’re good.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.468
What...?

30:44.593 --> 30:46.387
in the dark...

30:46.512 --> 30:49.515
THOMAS: So, yeah, I was doing
the band thing for a while.

30:49.598 --> 30:51.308
-Now I switched to commercials.
-WOMAN: Yeah, yeah.

30:51.392 --> 30:52.768
THOMAS:
More stable pay.

30:52.893 --> 30:54.395
Well, what was
the name of your band?

30:54.478 --> 30:56.397
Um, we were actually
called Stress.

30:56.522 --> 30:57.898
-Stress. I love that.
-Mm-hmm.

30:58.023 --> 31:00.067
Sorry, I got to stretch
a little bit.

31:14.957 --> 31:16.041
Hey.

31:16.166 --> 31:17.793
MAN:
Nice costume!

31:17.876 --> 31:19.169
Straight fire, Margot.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.214
How’s everyone doing over here?

31:22.298 --> 31:24.216
Can I get a hit of that?

31:24.341 --> 31:25.426
Thanks, Zorro.

31:29.805 --> 31:32.057
Well, make yourselves at home.

31:32.141 --> 31:34.476
Su casa, mi casa.

31:37.396 --> 31:40.441
PIPPA: She could have dressed
as any of the Tenenbaums,

31:40.524 --> 31:43.402
but no-- Margot.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.487
So, how did we do, chicken?

31:45.571 --> 31:46.989
Mission accomplished.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.742
Yes, that’s what I like to hear.

31:53.579 --> 31:54.872
All right. Ready?

31:54.997 --> 31:55.914
Copy.

31:55.998 --> 31:57.291
THOMAS:
Okay.

31:57.374 --> 32:00.377
So, you’re looking
for a little green dot.

32:00.461 --> 32:02.504
Tell me to move it up
or down or whatever.

32:02.588 --> 32:03.881
PIPPA:
I don’t see it.

32:04.006 --> 32:05.341
THOMAS:
Well, it’s there somewhere.

32:05.424 --> 32:06.884
PIPPA:
I know, but I don’t see it.

32:06.967 --> 32:08.969
Turn it off,
turn it off, turn it off!

32:09.053 --> 32:10.262
THOMAS:
What?

32:10.346 --> 32:11.805
A second longer,
they were gonna think

32:11.889 --> 32:13.557
they were gonna
get assassinated.

32:13.641 --> 32:16.393
Okay. Start lower.

32:16.477 --> 32:17.394
Okay, okay.

32:17.478 --> 32:19.271
PIPPA:
Okay, go right.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.315
A little more... and stop.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.193
Stop, stop. And now go up.

32:24.276 --> 32:26.195
A little higher.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.405
A little more, and stop.

32:29.323 --> 32:30.240
Mwah.

32:30.366 --> 32:31.450
Now what?

32:31.575 --> 32:33.535
Now we hope that
the angle of the mirror

32:33.619 --> 32:35.454
bounced it back here somewhere.

32:35.537 --> 32:38.582
This isn’t the most scientific
of methods.

32:40.084 --> 32:41.877
Hold on.

32:47.424 --> 32:48.926
Aw.

33:02.731 --> 33:04.983
I am so impressed right now.

33:15.369 --> 33:16.620
Man.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.372
Wait, wait. Wait.

33:29.258 --> 33:31.802
They sound like the teachers
from Charlie Brown.

33:31.885 --> 33:33.971
-Wah-wah, wah-wah, wah.
-Wah-wah.

33:34.054 --> 33:36.098
Wah-wah-wah, wah-wah-wah.

33:41.812 --> 33:43.981
MARGOT So if I’m
feeling upset about something,

33:44.106 --> 33:45.816
-I should just hide it?
-

33:45.941 --> 33:48.569
-

33:48.652 --> 33:51.280
MARGOT: I saw you go into
the bathroom with some woman.

33:51.363 --> 33:52.906
BRENT: Oh, you’ve got to
be kidding me.

33:52.990 --> 33:55.409
MARGOT:
In front of everybody.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.745
Are you fucking stupid?

33:58.662 --> 34:02.082
Did you think people
can’t see you?

34:02.166 --> 34:03.709
Did you? Hello! Hi!

34:03.834 --> 34:06.754
I can’t keep having
this conversation.

34:06.837 --> 34:09.214
Okay, all right, fine,
you really want to do it now?

34:09.339 --> 34:11.967
-Yeah.
-Tell me the truth.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.677
Do you still love me?

34:13.761 --> 34:15.471
Oh, fuck you. What?

34:15.554 --> 34:17.181
Do you?

34:17.264 --> 34:18.432
How-how... I’m sorry.

34:18.515 --> 34:20.017
How are you getting that
from this?

34:20.100 --> 34:21.602
Do you still love me?

34:21.685 --> 34:23.729
Don’t do this to me.
Don’t do that.

34:23.812 --> 34:25.355
Don’t do that.

34:25.439 --> 34:27.191
Look, I think... I think
you-you want to leave me

34:27.274 --> 34:29.109
but you-you haven’t got
the fucking balls to do it,

34:29.234 --> 34:31.111
so you come up with
all these ridiculous excuses

34:31.236 --> 34:33.447
just to try and make it
my fault and not yours.

34:33.572 --> 34:36.283
No. No, no, no, I saw you.

34:36.366 --> 34:37.659
BRENT: You know, I...
we’re to the point

34:37.785 --> 34:38.911
I shouldn’t even
have to explain myself.

34:38.994 --> 34:40.621
You’re supposed to trust me.

34:40.704 --> 34:42.790
You really think that I would
fuck someone in our apartment?

34:42.915 --> 34:44.875
-Is that what you think of me?
-I-I thought...

34:44.958 --> 34:46.627
-I saw you.
-You thought what?

34:46.710 --> 34:49.087
You know, I get it. I get it.
You’re insecure about my work.

34:49.171 --> 34:50.631
I get it. That makes sense.

34:50.714 --> 34:52.299
Okay, you’ve told me
a hundred times.

34:52.382 --> 34:54.384
But without my work,
who’s gonna pay for all this?

34:54.510 --> 34:55.886
-Are you? Huh?
-That’s not fair.

34:55.969 --> 34:57.304
Your income gonna support us?

34:57.387 --> 34:59.223
I mean, if you get...
if we get divorced,

34:59.306 --> 35:01.099
don’t know what you’re gonna do.

35:01.183 --> 35:02.684
Whoa, whoa. I...

35:02.810 --> 35:04.728
I don’t want a divorce.

35:04.812 --> 35:06.980
I-I... No.

35:07.064 --> 35:09.107
At a certain point, I have to
start thinking about it, Jules.

35:09.191 --> 35:10.734
-I’m trying my best here.
-I sorry, Seb. Sorry.

35:10.818 --> 35:13.654
I’m really trying, but what...
what else can I do?

35:13.779 --> 35:16.490
How long am I supposed to put up
with this?

35:18.450 --> 35:19.993
I’m sorry.

35:20.077 --> 35:21.411
If you’re sorry, you’d change.

35:21.537 --> 35:22.830
I will. I will.

35:22.955 --> 35:24.414
Will you? Don’t. Will you?

35:24.540 --> 35:26.458
Huh? Will you?

35:26.542 --> 35:28.293
-Will you change?
-Yes.

35:28.418 --> 35:29.878
-You will?
-Yes.

35:29.962 --> 35:31.630
Okay, so did I fuck
someone tonight?

35:31.755 --> 35:32.923
-No. No.
-No?

35:33.048 --> 35:34.466
Did-did...
Was someone sucking my cock?

35:34.550 --> 35:35.634
-No.
-No, they weren’t.

35:35.759 --> 35:37.177
-Do you still love me?
-Yes.

35:37.261 --> 35:40.222
Then stop acting
like such a fucking cunt!

35:40.305 --> 35:42.140
I’m tired.

36:12.629 --> 36:14.923
-

36:15.007 --> 36:17.134
-You okay?
-Yeah, I just...

36:17.217 --> 36:20.554
I think I’m coming down
with something.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.139
Yeah.

36:22.264 --> 36:25.726
There’s a nasty hangover going
through Montreal right now.

36:35.652 --> 36:37.863
-ARI: Hey, pip-squeak?

36:37.988 --> 36:40.866
-Can you come here for a sec?
-

36:52.878 --> 36:55.172
PIPPA:
Hello. Uh...

36:56.506 --> 36:58.383
How may I help you?

36:58.467 --> 37:01.094
Hi. I’m just looking
for some new glasses.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.889
Pippa is the best
at picking out frames.

37:03.972 --> 37:05.223
-MARGOT: Really?

37:05.349 --> 37:07.225
-Did you bring
your prescription? -No.

37:07.309 --> 37:10.228
I actually haven’t had my eyes
checked in, like, a few years.

37:10.312 --> 37:12.064
It might’ve changed.

37:12.147 --> 37:15.317
Pippa, you could squeeze her in
before your 2:30, right?

37:15.400 --> 37:17.110
Uh, an eye exam?

37:17.235 --> 37:20.697
MARGOT:
Oh, that would be great.

37:20.781 --> 37:23.700
-Uh, sure. Yeah.
-Thank you.

37:23.825 --> 37:26.119
Um, I’m Julia, by the way.

37:27.204 --> 37:28.372
Pippa.

37:28.497 --> 37:31.083
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

37:32.709 --> 37:36.964
I, F, O,

37:37.089 --> 37:39.716
Z, uh...

37:39.841 --> 37:41.468
oh, P?

37:41.593 --> 37:44.721
Oh, could be another F?

37:47.140 --> 37:49.309
Uh, here.

37:52.562 --> 37:55.816
A... or B?

37:55.899 --> 37:59.069
Um, can I see that again?

38:00.320 --> 38:03.657
A... or B?

38:05.325 --> 38:07.244
They look exactly
the same to me.

38:07.369 --> 38:08.537
Is that okay?

38:08.662 --> 38:10.330
Uh...

38:10.414 --> 38:12.374
You have terrible vision.

38:12.499 --> 38:14.334
But...

38:14.418 --> 38:16.128
most people’s vision sucks.

38:16.211 --> 38:18.296
It’s how I have a job.

38:18.422 --> 38:20.340
I’m gonna look at
the surface of your eye

38:20.424 --> 38:22.175
to see if there’s
any imperfections.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.052
-Okay.
-So just put your chin...

38:24.177 --> 38:26.221
-right there.
-Mm-hmm.

38:26.304 --> 38:29.391
PIPPA: You’re gonna see
a bright light for a second.

38:54.249 --> 38:57.127
Okay. I’m gonna come in
closer now.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.256
Okay.

39:03.050 --> 39:05.093
Look up.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.388
Left.

39:08.513 --> 39:10.098
Good.

39:10.223 --> 39:12.184
Right.

39:12.309 --> 39:14.352
Good.

39:19.524 --> 39:21.401
Once again.

39:27.616 --> 39:29.868
I’m so indecisive.
What do you think?

39:29.951 --> 39:33.205
Well, those are
definitely more...

39:33.330 --> 39:35.290
"sexy librarian."

39:36.583 --> 39:38.627
-Sexy librarian?
-Yeah, like...

39:38.710 --> 39:40.420
"Meet me in the stacks, big boy.

39:40.504 --> 39:43.048
Let’s read the latest
Emma Straub novel together."

39:43.131 --> 39:46.718
Where these,
they’re more "femme fatale."

39:46.843 --> 39:49.262
Like...
"I’m gonna bang Doogie Howser,

39:49.346 --> 39:50.764
then slit his throat."

39:50.847 --> 39:52.557
Oh, my God.

39:52.641 --> 39:54.643
Do you think
I can pull these off?

39:54.768 --> 39:55.894
Course you can.

39:56.019 --> 39:58.355
The great thing
about new glasses is

39:58.438 --> 40:00.148
you get to decide
who you want to be.

40:00.232 --> 40:02.067
Well, okay.

40:02.150 --> 40:04.611
These ones remind me
of my barista.

40:04.736 --> 40:05.779
So...

40:05.862 --> 40:07.864
I guess...

40:07.948 --> 40:10.742
I am the femme fatale.

40:11.576 --> 40:13.286
I think you might be.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.789
They really are so you.

40:16.790 --> 40:20.627
Hey, um, this might
sound weird...

40:22.170 --> 40:26.258
Maybe this is awkward.
Um, would you ever want to get

40:26.341 --> 40:29.386
a cup of coffee sometime
or something?

40:29.511 --> 40:30.470
Is that weird?

40:30.595 --> 40:31.888
No.

40:32.013 --> 40:33.223
Are you sure?

40:33.306 --> 40:35.267
No, I’d... I’d love that.

40:35.392 --> 40:38.895
I mean, I know we just met,
but you seem cool.

40:38.979 --> 40:40.730
Thank you.

40:40.814 --> 40:43.275
Well, uh,
can I have your number?

40:44.151 --> 40:45.777
Yeah. My cell.

40:45.902 --> 40:48.071
Awesome. Um, well,
some friends of mine

40:48.196 --> 40:49.573
opened a spa this weekend.

40:49.656 --> 40:52.242
Maybe we could
check that out or something?

40:52.325 --> 40:53.702
-I’ll call you.
-Yeah.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.954
-That-that sounds amazing.
-Okay.

40:56.037 --> 40:58.999
-Bye.
-Bye.

41:01.376 --> 41:03.503
Mom, what’s wrong?

41:16.224 --> 41:18.310
-

41:18.393 --> 41:20.270
NARRATOR
Whether it’s your birthday,

41:20.353 --> 41:22.272
anniversary or any old Tuesday,

41:22.397 --> 41:24.191
there’s always
a reason to celebrate.

41:24.316 --> 41:26.401
So don’t let E.D.
ruin your party.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.570
Ask your doctor if your heart
is healthy enough for...

41:28.695 --> 41:30.947
-

41:45.754 --> 41:47.589
BRENT: Can you put
your fingers around the frame?

41:47.672 --> 41:49.132
It’s your frame.
It’s not a prop.

41:49.257 --> 41:50.675
You own it, okay?

41:50.759 --> 41:52.385
I mean, I’d love
to go down on you.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.137
THOMAS:
What? What did he just say?

41:54.221 --> 41:56.848
BRENT: Okay, try this.
Put your arms up at the top.

41:56.932 --> 41:58.433
That’s it. Hold it.

41:58.558 --> 41:59.935
You earned it. Come on.

42:00.018 --> 42:01.811
THOMAS: "Oh, we just both
have our shirts off.

42:01.895 --> 42:04.773
And everything is fine
and completely professional."

42:04.898 --> 42:06.358
BRENT:
Ever since you walked in here,

42:06.441 --> 42:08.235
I’ve been wondering
what you taste like.

42:08.318 --> 42:09.694
THOMAS:
Oh, geez Louise.

42:09.778 --> 42:12.739
-Can you take it down a notch?
-BRENT: Okay.

42:12.822 --> 42:14.699
Got it.

42:14.824 --> 42:16.076
See? Look at your face.

42:16.159 --> 42:18.578
-It’s a trap.
-You’re genuinely shocked.

42:18.662 --> 42:20.747
I thought you were
being serious.

42:20.872 --> 42:22.332
I was.

42:22.415 --> 42:24.292
THOMAS:
No. No, no, no, no, no.

42:24.376 --> 42:25.835
Too touchy.

42:25.919 --> 42:28.296
Get your big-ass necklace
and get out of there, girl.

42:28.421 --> 42:30.757
BRENT:
There’s no extra charge for it.

42:30.840 --> 42:32.634
You usually charge?

42:32.717 --> 42:34.636
Oh, yeah, usually,
it’s an extra 200 bucks--

42:34.761 --> 42:37.305
the cunnilingus fee--
but I’ll waive it for you.

42:37.389 --> 42:39.724
-THOMAS: Oh, my God.
-

42:39.808 --> 42:41.685
Well, I appreciate that.

42:41.768 --> 42:43.603
Look, come on. What’s the issue?

42:43.728 --> 42:46.398
-Come on, bruh.
-MODEL: I’m not gonna...

42:46.481 --> 42:48.149
Look, you can go sit
on the metro

42:48.275 --> 42:50.694
and wonder what it would’ve
been like if you stayed,

42:50.777 --> 42:54.531
or you can stay for 30 minutes,

42:54.614 --> 42:57.826
and I’ll make you come harder
than you ever thought possible.

42:57.909 --> 43:00.412
THOMAS:
What? What? I...

43:00.495 --> 43:03.206
This can’t actually work.

43:06.668 --> 43:09.004
-Okay.
-THOMAS: Ugh.

43:09.087 --> 43:11.006
All right.

43:24.936 --> 43:27.272
-BRENT: Feels good, right?
-MODEL: Yeah.

43:35.822 --> 43:36.906
What?

43:36.990 --> 43:38.199
Uh-huh.

43:38.325 --> 43:40.118
-What? What?
-Yeah.

43:40.201 --> 43:41.286
-Yes.
-Shut up.

43:41.369 --> 43:42.454
-I know!
-What?

43:42.537 --> 43:44.080
Did you talk to her?

43:44.164 --> 43:47.083
If, by "her," you mean Julia,
then yeah.

43:47.208 --> 43:48.626
Julia?

43:48.710 --> 43:51.129
But, dude, I know what the
inside of her oculus looks like.

43:51.254 --> 43:53.465
Of all the eye clinics
in the world...

43:53.548 --> 43:55.091
She walks into mine.

43:55.175 --> 43:58.470
And what’s even crazier,
we totally hit it off

43:58.553 --> 44:00.472
and we’re gonna hang out
this weekend.

44:00.555 --> 44:02.349
-This is crazy!
-To be honest,

44:02.432 --> 44:04.142
I think that
she just needs a friend.

44:04.267 --> 44:08.104
Someone to talk to about her
super unhealthy relationship.

44:08.188 --> 44:10.732
Uh, y-yeah, I saw him today.

44:10.815 --> 44:13.318
He-he kind of took advantage
of this girl.

44:13.401 --> 44:16.696
What? He screwed someone
while she was with me?

44:16.780 --> 44:18.656
Uh, technically oral,

44:18.782 --> 44:21.826
but it was not cool, so...

44:21.910 --> 44:23.745
I don’t know, I-I was thinking,

44:23.870 --> 44:26.247
and I think maybe
this isn’t good for us.

44:26.373 --> 44:27.832
-PIPPA: Yeah. I agree.

44:27.916 --> 44:29.501
It felt weird not telling her.

44:29.584 --> 44:31.252
Yeah, but it-it feels weird
to be spying

44:31.336 --> 44:32.462
on our neighbors, right?

44:32.545 --> 44:34.005
I mean, sneaking around,

44:34.089 --> 44:36.007
keeping our lights off
so they don’t see us.

44:36.091 --> 44:38.802
You’re not really seeing her
this weekend, are you?

44:38.927 --> 44:41.388
If I was cheating on you,
wouldn’t you want to know?

44:41.513 --> 44:43.431
I don’t know that I would.

44:43.556 --> 44:46.518
I don’t love that you keep going
to these hypothetical places.

44:46.601 --> 44:48.395
But it’s not hypothetical here.

44:48.478 --> 44:51.147
That asshole is being
totally unfaithful,

44:51.231 --> 44:52.690
and we know that, so now I have

44:52.774 --> 44:55.860
the moral responsibility
to do the right thing.

44:55.944 --> 44:57.904
Okay, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

44:58.029 --> 45:00.407
Chicken. Babe.

45:00.532 --> 45:02.492
When we decided
to move in together,

45:02.575 --> 45:06.413
I-I was excited about
you and me taking this step.

45:06.496 --> 45:08.456
I get that you’re trying
to do the right thing--

45:08.581 --> 45:11.668
I-I-I get it--
but let’s get back to us.

45:13.128 --> 45:17.048
Maybe I-I could just
tell her this weekend.

45:25.557 --> 45:27.517
Am I not enough for you?

45:27.600 --> 45:29.978
I promise I will rip
the Band-Aid off and be done.

45:30.061 --> 45:31.479
You’re not listening.

45:31.604 --> 45:34.149
Maybe it’ll give her
the confidence she need...

45:34.232 --> 45:35.567
Where are you going?

45:35.692 --> 45:37.110
-I’m going to get a drink.
-But we were just...

45:37.235 --> 45:39.654
Pippa, she doesn’t need
to be saved.

45:39.737 --> 45:41.823
She doesn’t need
to be saved by you.

45:41.906 --> 45:43.616
This is straight-up
none of your business.

45:43.700 --> 45:46.286
Thomas.

45:56.713 --> 45:58.798
JULIA
Hello.

46:01.134 --> 46:03.136
Baby, I’m talking to you.

46:03.219 --> 46:05.054
BRENT:
Yeah?

46:08.224 --> 46:10.310
JULIA:
Hmm? Hmm?

46:16.774 --> 46:20.487
I was feeling gloomy all day

46:20.612 --> 46:23.072
because of our little spat
last night.

46:23.198 --> 46:25.033
And...

46:25.116 --> 46:27.035
I really didn’t mean it.

46:27.160 --> 46:30.580
I was kind of hoping
I could make it up to you.

46:33.208 --> 46:35.418
-Baby.
-Mm-hmm?

46:36.503 --> 46:38.213
Um...

46:39.506 --> 46:42.842
-Just...
-Just relax, will you?

46:42.926 --> 46:44.761
BRENT:
Okay, I am... I am relaxed.

46:44.844 --> 46:46.721
-JULIA: You’re not relaxed.
-I’m just... I am relaxed.

46:46.804 --> 46:49.766
-JULIA: Mm-mm.
-I’m just not really

46:49.849 --> 46:51.935
in the mood for it, okay?

46:52.018 --> 46:54.979
Are you sure
I can’t convince you?

46:55.063 --> 46:58.024
We can do birthday-only stuff.

46:59.359 --> 47:01.110
Hey, you’re really sweet.
It’s just...

47:01.236 --> 47:03.530
just not tonight, okay?

47:03.613 --> 47:05.532
I forgive you for yesterday.

47:05.657 --> 47:07.408
I do.

47:36.396 --> 47:38.147
Pippa. Pippa.

47:38.231 --> 47:40.275
Hi. Hi.

47:40.358 --> 47:42.652
Mwah. Mwah.
Oh, my God, I so need this.

47:42.735 --> 47:44.946
Kind of had a rough week.

47:45.071 --> 47:47.031
Let’s go.

47:50.827 --> 47:53.997
JULIA: You seem
to really love your job.

47:54.080 --> 47:56.541
PIPPA:
I do. I... I don’t know,

47:56.666 --> 48:00.670
I-I had the realization
the other day that...

48:00.753 --> 48:02.589
I really like ophthalmology.

48:02.672 --> 48:05.049
Like, it just, it makes sense
to my brain.

48:05.133 --> 48:06.968
-You’re really good at it.
-

48:07.051 --> 48:08.386
Thank you.

48:08.469 --> 48:11.598
But I’m gonna be doing it
for the rest of my life.

48:11.723 --> 48:14.309
And I’ve finally achieved
the one thing

48:14.392 --> 48:16.978
that I’ve worked
years and years to do,

48:17.061 --> 48:20.607
and in the process,
I kind of killed off

48:20.690 --> 48:23.026
all possibilities
of something else.

48:23.151 --> 48:24.569
-Yeah.
-It’s like when you’re

48:24.652 --> 48:26.821
so obsessed with something
that you forget

48:26.904 --> 48:30.116
to pick your head up
and look around and go,

48:30.199 --> 48:31.784
"Oh, wait.

48:31.868 --> 48:33.786
What am I even doing?"

48:35.788 --> 48:39.000
But you’re too far down
the rabbit hole.

48:42.503 --> 48:44.672
Yeah.

48:44.756 --> 48:47.091
I have the opposite problem
as you.

48:47.175 --> 48:49.010
PIPPA:
What do you do?

48:49.135 --> 48:51.679
I’m kind of trying
to figure that out.

48:51.763 --> 48:53.640
I was a...

48:53.765 --> 48:55.433
I was a model.

48:55.516 --> 48:57.060
Oh, my God.

48:57.185 --> 48:59.020
I say that like
I’m embarrassed about it.

48:59.103 --> 49:01.105
Um, I was a model,

49:01.189 --> 49:03.232
but I’m not anymore.

49:03.358 --> 49:05.026
What do you mean?

49:06.903 --> 49:10.782
I guess it’s hard to find
deeper meaning in your work

49:10.865 --> 49:13.409
when your job is to force up
a smile every day

49:13.493 --> 49:16.788
for the world to decide
whether you’re sexy enough.

49:16.871 --> 49:20.124
I mean, even though you feel
numb and objectified,

49:20.249 --> 49:21.959
you’re addicted because

49:22.043 --> 49:24.921
your sense of self-worth
is all wrapped up in it.

49:25.004 --> 49:28.466
I decided that
my second nervous breakdown

49:28.591 --> 49:30.635
would be my last.

49:31.761 --> 49:33.471
I walked away.

49:33.596 --> 49:36.599
Now I’m looking at the rest
of my life, and I’m so lost.

49:36.724 --> 49:38.768
-But...

49:38.851 --> 49:41.396
you could do anything.

49:41.479 --> 49:44.148
What’s holding you back?

49:44.273 --> 49:46.275
Honestly, myself.

49:46.359 --> 49:49.779
I have like 8,000 interests
and zero skills.

49:49.904 --> 49:51.447
Come on, that’s not true.

49:51.531 --> 49:53.908
Seriously. I...
I didn’t go to college.

49:53.991 --> 49:55.576
I can barely type.

49:55.702 --> 49:57.370
I just bought
this wireless printer,

49:57.495 --> 49:59.622
and it took me literally forever
to figure out how it works.

49:59.706 --> 50:01.624
Yeah, well, on the plus side,

50:01.708 --> 50:03.710
you don’t have
any student loans.

50:03.793 --> 50:06.337
On the minus side,
I don’t have a career.

50:06.421 --> 50:08.756
My husband, he got me this job

50:08.840 --> 50:11.801
working at this, like,
fancy-pants photo studio.

50:11.926 --> 50:14.220
And it’s cool,
I get to travel around

50:14.303 --> 50:16.889
for gallery openings and such,
and it’s-it’s neat,

50:17.014 --> 50:21.269
but it’s not my raison d’être.

50:43.499 --> 50:46.335
This feels so nice.

50:50.465 --> 50:52.383
What are you waiting for?

51:01.934 --> 51:04.687
PIPPA:
So, your husband, what’s he do?

51:04.771 --> 51:06.564
Oh. His name’s Sebastian.
Well, Seb.

51:06.689 --> 51:07.857
Seb.

51:07.940 --> 51:10.026
He’s a photographer.

51:11.819 --> 51:14.238
Kind of a name
in that world, actually.

51:14.363 --> 51:15.865
-He’s a genius.

51:15.948 --> 51:18.284
I mean, I know people throw
that word around a lot,

51:18.367 --> 51:20.036
but he really is one.

51:20.870 --> 51:22.538
Did you guys meet through work?

51:22.622 --> 51:26.292
We... might’ve slept together
after a shoot.

51:26.375 --> 51:29.545
-Usually when that would happen,

51:29.629 --> 51:33.716
I was just another exotic flavor
for them to try, but...

51:33.841 --> 51:38.471
Seb, he loves me.

51:39.305 --> 51:40.723
He sounds like a catch.

51:40.807 --> 51:44.101
Oh, and he’s, like,
incredible in bed, so...

51:45.937 --> 51:48.731
Oh, must be all
sunshine and roses, then, huh?

51:48.815 --> 51:50.233
Yeah...

51:50.316 --> 51:54.654
I mean, he’s an artist,
so he’s...

51:54.737 --> 51:56.447
eccentric.

51:56.572 --> 52:00.952
Um, that comes with
a certain baggage.

52:01.035 --> 52:03.830
But without him, I...

52:03.955 --> 52:07.166
don’t know what I’d do
with my life.

52:08.459 --> 52:10.628
He’s all I’ve got.

52:31.899 --> 52:33.985
Are you okay, Margot?

52:38.364 --> 52:40.449
Who’s Margot?

52:42.869 --> 52:44.662
I’m so sorry.
I know your name.

52:44.745 --> 52:47.456
Margot. That is so funny,

52:47.582 --> 52:49.876
’cause, like,
I just had this Hallow...

52:49.959 --> 52:55.298
Anyway, my husband is just
a complex individual is all.

52:56.591 --> 52:58.676
You should meet him sometime.

53:00.219 --> 53:02.305
-Yeah.

53:02.388 --> 53:04.432
PIPPA:
Yeah, I will. Thank you.

53:04.557 --> 53:06.183
Bye.

53:06.309 --> 53:08.144
See you.

53:53.898 --> 53:55.983
SEB:
No peeking.

54:01.489 --> 54:02.823
Aw.

58:25.836 --> 58:27.755
-Jules.
-

58:27.838 --> 58:30.341
-What are you doing up?
-JULIA: Uh, reading.

58:32.009 --> 58:34.511
That new book I mentioned.

58:34.637 --> 58:37.014
-Must be engrossing.
-Yeah.

58:39.600 --> 58:41.894
Yeah. What are you doing up?

58:42.019 --> 58:43.604
-Just getting some water.
-THOMAS: Pippa!

58:43.687 --> 58:44.897
-Thomas.
-What are you doing?

58:45.022 --> 58:46.065
No, no, don’t.

58:46.148 --> 58:47.358
Thom...
You-you don’t understand.

58:47.441 --> 58:48.776
I thought we were done
with this.

58:48.859 --> 58:50.569
-I’m really worried.
-Worried about what?

58:50.653 --> 58:52.363
SEB
Think I must’ve eaten something

58:52.488 --> 58:53.697
that didn’t agree with me.

58:53.822 --> 58:54.990
Don’t stay up too late.

58:55.115 --> 58:57.076
-Good night.
-JULIA: Oh, good night.

58:57.159 --> 58:58.869
Yeah, I’m real worried, too.

58:58.953 --> 59:01.705
Why are you acting
so ridiculous?

59:12.925 --> 59:14.843
What did you do?

59:22.559 --> 59:25.145
-Pippa, what did you do?
-No, shh!

59:27.189 --> 59:28.899
You told her.

59:29.024 --> 59:31.193
Thomas, I had to.

59:44.164 --> 59:45.791
THOMAS:
Look at her.

59:45.874 --> 59:48.794
-Look at her!
-I know you think this is wrong.

59:48.877 --> 59:50.004
It is wrong.

59:50.129 --> 59:51.797
I couldn’t just
sit back and watch.

59:51.880 --> 59:53.382
You didn’t need to watch, Pippa.

59:53.465 --> 59:55.634
We both decided to peer in
on them. We both did that.

59:55.718 --> 59:58.304
So it’s not my fault
that we discovered this.

59:58.387 --> 59:59.513
Wait. What is she doing?

59:59.596 --> 1:00:00.848
It was your idea
in the first place.

1:00:00.931 --> 1:00:02.266
Pippa, give me those.

1:00:12.735 --> 1:00:14.570
PIPPA:
Oh, my God.

1:00:15.571 --> 1:00:17.448
THOMAS:
Is she...

1:00:19.908 --> 1:00:22.202
Thomas, what...
what-what do we do?

1:00:22.286 --> 1:00:24.580
Jesus, are we gonna watch
this woman stab this man?

1:00:24.705 --> 1:00:26.457
-I’m calling the cops.
-No.

1:00:26.540 --> 1:00:27.875
No, you-you can’t call the cops.

1:00:27.958 --> 1:00:29.043
I’m calling the cops.
We’re about to watch

1:00:29.126 --> 1:00:30.252
a murder that you instigated.

1:00:30.336 --> 1:00:32.338
I didn’t tell her
to kill anyone.

1:00:32.421 --> 1:00:34.381
-Don’t call the police.
-Then what do we do, Pippa?

1:00:34.506 --> 1:00:36.342
I don’t know!

1:01:21.720 --> 1:01:23.680
Fuck!

1:01:24.515 --> 1:01:26.809
I wish we had another room.

1:01:53.335 --> 1:01:55.045
Say when.

1:01:55.879 --> 1:01:57.714
PIPPA:
When.

1:02:11.145 --> 1:02:13.021
Thomas.

1:02:13.147 --> 1:02:15.315
Yeah.

1:02:16.775 --> 1:02:20.654
You have every right
in the world to be mad at me.

1:02:22.114 --> 1:02:24.158
I am.

1:02:27.035 --> 1:02:30.831
I’m-I’m disappointed, you know?

1:02:32.916 --> 1:02:34.626
Yeah.

1:02:34.710 --> 1:02:36.420
I know.

1:02:39.173 --> 1:02:41.758
I want to know
that I can trust you.

1:02:43.385 --> 1:02:45.262
You can.

1:02:48.474 --> 1:02:50.601
I want to feel like
I’m enough for you.

1:02:50.726 --> 1:02:52.436
You are.

1:02:54.605 --> 1:02:56.899
I’m done.

1:02:56.982 --> 1:02:59.776
I will throw away
the binoculars.

1:02:59.860 --> 1:03:03.489
I... I will not see her again.

1:03:04.531 --> 1:03:06.575
I’m sorry.

1:03:13.123 --> 1:03:15.000
Okay.

1:03:22.216 --> 1:03:24.218
Can I get a hug?

1:03:25.260 --> 1:03:26.803
Yeah.

1:03:30.516 --> 1:03:33.018
I love you.

1:03:33.977 --> 1:03:36.146
I love you, too.

1:03:47.074 --> 1:03:49.159
No.

1:03:49.243 --> 1:03:51.286
THOMAS:
What?

1:03:51.411 --> 1:03:53.288
No.

1:03:54.331 --> 1:03:57.376
-What are you doing?
-No, no, no, no.

1:04:07.386 --> 1:04:08.929
PIPPA:
Oh, my...

1:04:09.054 --> 1:04:10.264
No.

1:04:13.392 --> 1:04:16.603
Wh-What do, what do we,
what do we do?

1:04:24.194 --> 1:04:25.821
Thomas.

1:04:28.365 --> 1:04:29.866
Uh...

1:04:29.992 --> 1:04:31.618
-I have to go.
-Wait. What?

1:04:31.743 --> 1:04:33.620
-I can’t be here.
-Where are you going?

1:04:33.704 --> 1:04:36.248
I don’t know. Maybe I’ll stay
with my sisters.

1:04:36.331 --> 1:04:38.166
I just can’t be here.

1:04:38.250 --> 1:04:40.586
Th-Th-Thomas, you can’t go.

1:04:40.711 --> 1:04:43.005
-No.
-Thomas, no, please, you can’t.

1:04:43.130 --> 1:04:44.590
-I need you right now.
-No, no.

1:04:44.715 --> 1:04:46.383
-I-I can’t be with you.
-Thomas, wait!

1:04:46.466 --> 1:04:48.135
I told you we needed
to stop, but no,

1:04:48.260 --> 1:04:50.012
you and your goddamn sense
of self-righteousness

1:04:50.137 --> 1:04:51.763
-had to go and do that.
-Thomas, I...

1:04:51.847 --> 1:04:53.724
Thomas, I’m really
scared, and I need you.

1:04:53.849 --> 1:04:56.226
Please don’t go.
I-I love you.

1:04:56.310 --> 1:04:57.894
If you loved me,
you would’ve listened to me.

1:04:58.020 --> 1:04:59.855
How was I supposed to know
what was gonna happen?

1:04:59.938 --> 1:05:01.315
Like, what am I supposed to do?

1:05:01.440 --> 1:05:03.775
There’s nothing you can do,
Pippa! She’s dead!

1:05:03.900 --> 1:05:05.319
Because of you!

1:05:05.444 --> 1:05:07.529
You ended that
fucking woman’s life!

1:05:07.613 --> 1:05:09.531
-You did that.
-Stop.

1:05:09.615 --> 1:05:12.951
-I don’t even know you anymore.
-Please just stop.

1:05:15.162 --> 1:05:17.039
We’re done.

1:05:17.122 --> 1:05:18.749
It’s over.

1:05:18.874 --> 1:05:20.375
Thomas!

1:05:39.353 --> 1:05:42.189
PIPPA: Hi. Uh, it’s Pippa
from L’optique.

1:05:42.272 --> 1:05:44.483
Yeah, your glasses came in.

1:05:44.608 --> 1:05:47.319
-Open till 6:00. Mm-hmm.
-

1:06:15.681 --> 1:06:18.058
JULIA
Hi. You haven’t reached Julia,

1:06:18.183 --> 1:06:21.019
but if you’re feeling quaint,
please leave a voice mail.

1:06:21.103 --> 1:06:23.063
-Beep.
-

1:06:23.146 --> 1:06:25.482
Uh, hi, uh, Julia.

1:06:25.565 --> 1:06:29.861
It’s-it’s... it’s Pippa,
the ophthalmologist.

1:06:29.986 --> 1:06:31.613
Um...

1:06:31.738 --> 1:06:35.242
I just... I wanted
to let you know...

1:06:35.325 --> 1:06:38.662
Well, I wanted to let
you know...

1:06:40.205 --> 1:06:42.082
...uh, y-your glasses are ready.

1:06:44.626 --> 1:06:46.503
I’m-I’m really sorry.

1:06:46.586 --> 1:06:48.755
I’m so sorry. I didn’t know.

1:06:48.839 --> 1:06:50.841
If I would have known,
I would have never done that.

1:06:50.924 --> 1:06:52.384
I’m so sorry.
I don’t know why...

1:06:52.467 --> 1:06:54.720
I don’t know why that happened.

1:06:54.803 --> 1:06:57.848
I’m... I’m so sorry.

1:06:59.975 --> 1:07:02.185
I’m so sorry.

1:09:38.258 --> 1:09:41.303
this bow and arrow

1:09:44.431 --> 1:09:49.185
the other girls to play

1:09:51.187 --> 1:09:55.775
a temptress too long

1:10:33.688 --> 1:10:35.440
SEB:
Do I know you?

1:10:35.523 --> 1:10:37.484
PIPPA:
Uh, I-I...

1:10:37.609 --> 1:10:39.945
I don’t think you do.

1:10:40.070 --> 1:10:42.364
SEB:
You’ve got a familiar face.

1:10:42.489 --> 1:10:44.407
Pretty eyes.

1:10:44.491 --> 1:10:46.451
Thanks.

1:10:47.285 --> 1:10:48.578
What would you like?

1:10:48.662 --> 1:10:50.997
Uh, vodka tonic,
s’il vous plaît.

1:10:51.081 --> 1:10:54.042
No. It’s not the kind of place
you order a vodka tonic.

1:10:54.125 --> 1:10:55.752
Deux penicillin. Merci.

1:10:55.877 --> 1:11:00.674
to love you...

1:11:02.133 --> 1:11:05.053
You don’t mind
if I sit here, do you?

1:11:05.136 --> 1:11:07.764
I’ll move when
your Tinder hookup arrives.

1:11:10.183 --> 1:11:12.143
No, I-I don’t mind.

1:11:14.646 --> 1:11:16.439
So, stranger,

1:11:16.523 --> 1:11:18.984
I’m trying to work
something out.

1:11:19.818 --> 1:11:22.028
Can I ask you a question?

1:11:22.153 --> 1:11:24.155
Um...

1:11:24.239 --> 1:11:26.074
Yeah, sure.

1:11:26.157 --> 1:11:27.909
It’s a personal question.

1:11:31.246 --> 1:11:33.498
Do you watch pornography?

1:11:35.417 --> 1:11:37.460
-E-Excuse me?
-Porn.

1:11:37.544 --> 1:11:38.753
Do you watch it?

1:11:39.879 --> 1:11:42.007
Uh, not frequently. No.

1:11:42.090 --> 1:11:44.092
But on occasion?

1:11:44.217 --> 1:11:45.677
-Maybe.
-Right.

1:11:45.802 --> 1:11:48.054
Most people watch porn
all the time.

1:11:48.138 --> 1:11:50.807
Husbands, wives,
girlfriends, boyfriends,

1:11:50.932 --> 1:11:54.102
lovers, moms, dads,
pets, everyone.

1:11:54.185 --> 1:11:55.687
Everyone watches porn.

1:11:55.770 --> 1:11:57.939
Now, I bet you there’s
a dozen people on this block

1:11:58.023 --> 1:12:00.316
jerking off to porn
right this very second.

1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:02.944
People in
very serious relationships.

1:12:03.028 --> 1:12:05.321
And it doesn’t matter, right?

1:12:06.448 --> 1:12:08.366
Can I ask you another question?

1:12:08.491 --> 1:12:10.702
You ever been in
a serious relationship?

1:12:12.537 --> 1:12:14.414
Yeah.

1:12:14.497 --> 1:12:17.375
And did your boyfriend
or girlfriend...

1:12:17.500 --> 1:12:18.793
It’s a boyfriend.

1:12:18.877 --> 1:12:20.795
Did your boyfriend
ever masturbate?

1:12:22.714 --> 1:12:24.340
-Probably.
-He did.

1:12:24.466 --> 1:12:26.009
Did you?

1:12:26.134 --> 1:12:27.594
Maybe.

1:12:27.677 --> 1:12:31.806
And did this simple act change
the love you had for him?

1:12:31.931 --> 1:12:32.766
No.

1:12:32.891 --> 1:12:34.142
It didn’t. Why is that?

1:12:34.267 --> 1:12:35.810
I don’t know.
Because it’s meaningless.

1:12:35.894 --> 1:12:38.271
Exactly. And tell me this--

1:12:38.396 --> 1:12:41.524
what’s the difference between
your vibrator and a human penis?

1:12:41.608 --> 1:12:43.485
How do you know
I have a vibrator?

1:12:43.568 --> 1:12:44.861
’Cause you’re a woman.

1:12:44.944 --> 1:12:48.490
A vibrator doesn’t
have feelings.

1:12:49.574 --> 1:12:51.701
A vibrator isn’t
connected to a brain.

1:12:51.785 --> 1:12:53.953
I would argue that most penises
aren’t connected to a brain.

1:12:54.037 --> 1:12:55.997
A vibrator isn’t
connected to a soul.

1:12:56.081 --> 1:12:57.624
Well, I don’t know about you,

1:12:57.749 --> 1:12:59.626
but I’ve had plenty of sex
that was just as meaningless,

1:12:59.709 --> 1:13:01.336
if not more meaningless
than masturbation.

1:13:01.419 --> 1:13:03.838
The only difference is
it’s just more fun

1:13:03.963 --> 1:13:06.966
having sex with a person
than it is with your hand.

1:13:07.050 --> 1:13:09.594
Not everyone agrees with you.

1:13:13.765 --> 1:13:16.392
No, they don’t.

1:13:17.769 --> 1:13:20.939
No matter how much
you fucking love them.

1:13:36.955 --> 1:13:39.165
Sorry, I’m just... I’m...

1:13:40.333 --> 1:13:43.461
I’m going through
the most difficult, um,

1:13:43.545 --> 1:13:46.589
separation of my life right now.

1:13:46.673 --> 1:13:48.591
And, um...

1:13:48.716 --> 1:13:51.219
I know I can be a bit blunt.
I’m sorry.

1:13:52.679 --> 1:13:54.806
It’s okay.

1:13:54.889 --> 1:13:56.766
Thanks.

1:14:15.201 --> 1:14:17.787
"The Ass and His Masters."

1:14:17.912 --> 1:14:19.205
Say what?

1:14:19.330 --> 1:14:20.748
"The Ass and His Masters."

1:14:20.832 --> 1:14:23.126
It’s a fable.
You just made me think of it.

1:14:23.251 --> 1:14:26.880
The ass referring
to a donkey in this case.

1:14:27.005 --> 1:14:29.632
Story goes--
this donkey, he’s owned

1:14:29.716 --> 1:14:31.551
by an herb farmer
who doesn’t feed him well.

1:14:31.676 --> 1:14:35.263
He has to work in this garden
all day long, and he’s starving.

1:14:35.388 --> 1:14:38.183
So he goes to this god Jupiter,
and he’s like,

1:14:38.308 --> 1:14:40.685
"Hey, man, can I please
get a new master?

1:14:40.768 --> 1:14:42.020
I’m starving over here."

1:14:42.103 --> 1:14:43.897
And Jupiter’s feeling
really gracious,

1:14:43.980 --> 1:14:46.608
so he’s like,
"Sure thing. Wish granted."

1:14:46.691 --> 1:14:49.611
And the next day, the donkey,
he is sold to a potter.

1:14:49.694 --> 1:14:52.488
Great. Life must be
peaches and cream now, right?

1:14:52.572 --> 1:14:55.074
Wrong. It’s the worst job
a donkey could have.

1:14:55.200 --> 1:14:57.076
He’s fed well,
but now he has to carry

1:14:57.160 --> 1:14:59.829
these super heavy bricks
to and fro all day.

1:14:59.913 --> 1:15:02.248
So he goes to Jupiter again,
and he’s like,

1:15:02.373 --> 1:15:05.501
"Hey, Jupiter, I really need
another master, please."

1:15:05.585 --> 1:15:08.671
Jupiter’s like,
"Whoa, slow your roll, man.

1:15:08.755 --> 1:15:11.716
I’m only gonna do this
one more time. Are you sure?"

1:15:11.841 --> 1:15:13.927
And donkey’s like,
"I got this pain in my back,

1:15:14.010 --> 1:15:15.261
"and it won’t go away.

1:15:15.386 --> 1:15:17.096
"There’s no such thing
as Advil yet.

1:15:17.180 --> 1:15:18.973
Will you please
just do me this favor?"

1:15:19.098 --> 1:15:22.977
So, the next day,
the donkey is sold again,

1:15:23.061 --> 1:15:26.856
to a leather tanner
who hangs donkey,

1:15:26.940 --> 1:15:28.983
bleeds him out, skins him

1:15:29.108 --> 1:15:32.695
and turns him into
a pair of sandals.

1:15:32.779 --> 1:15:34.447
Moral of the story:

1:15:34.530 --> 1:15:36.658
He who finds discontentment
in one place

1:15:36.741 --> 1:15:40.036
is unlikely
to find happiness in another.

1:15:44.040 --> 1:15:47.043
You know why Aesop
wrote that fable?

1:15:48.628 --> 1:15:53.216
I-I just said, to show that
the grass isn’t greener.

1:15:54.300 --> 1:15:56.469
No.

1:15:56.552 --> 1:15:58.721
He wrote it for his slaves.

1:15:58.805 --> 1:16:00.098
So when they’re feeling down,

1:16:00.223 --> 1:16:01.683
they could tell each other
that story

1:16:01.766 --> 1:16:04.227
and make themselves feel better.

1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:07.313
When in reality,

1:16:07.438 --> 1:16:10.233
they were just
deeply, deeply repressed.

1:16:16.072 --> 1:16:18.533
Would it be strange if I asked
to take your picture?

1:16:43.641 --> 1:16:45.560
SEB:
Watch out for broken glass.

1:16:45.643 --> 1:16:47.687
I had a little accident.

1:16:51.357 --> 1:16:53.693
PIPPA:
It’s a nice place.

1:16:53.776 --> 1:16:56.487
SEB: Let’s break out
the good stuff, shall we?

1:16:57.739 --> 1:16:59.240
Scassari.

1:16:59.324 --> 1:17:03.453
The grapes are grown under the
shadow of a volcano in Italy.

1:17:06.247 --> 1:17:08.416
So you’re a professional?

1:17:09.792 --> 1:17:11.711
Sure.

1:17:22.930 --> 1:17:25.767
You know, my latest
exhibition opens in a few weeks.

1:17:25.850 --> 1:17:27.685
You should come.

1:17:28.853 --> 1:17:31.898
Uh, I’ll think about it.

1:17:36.152 --> 1:17:37.904
Would you stand there for me?

1:17:38.029 --> 1:17:40.073
Yeah.

1:17:46.871 --> 1:17:48.414
Turn to me.

1:17:50.875 --> 1:17:53.044
Those eyes.

1:17:53.878 --> 1:17:55.963
You sure we’ve never met before?

1:18:06.349 --> 1:18:08.267
-Oh, my hair’s not really...
-

1:18:08.393 --> 1:18:09.477
No, it’s good.

1:18:09.560 --> 1:18:11.270
PIPPA:
Um...

1:18:11.354 --> 1:18:14.273
I-I don’t know what I’m doing.

1:18:15.566 --> 1:18:18.778
Just do whatever I tell you
to do, and it will be perfect.

1:18:20.488 --> 1:18:22.740
Put your left hand
on your shoulder.

1:18:23.574 --> 1:18:25.243
Head down.

1:18:26.744 --> 1:18:28.454
You look so kind.

1:18:30.289 --> 1:18:32.083
Eyes to me.

1:18:38.131 --> 1:18:39.590
Is it okay?

1:18:39.674 --> 1:18:42.969
It’s just this... this jumper.

1:18:44.011 --> 1:18:45.680
What’s your bra look like?

1:18:47.181 --> 1:18:48.599
Subtle.

1:18:48.683 --> 1:18:50.893
Look, I work with naked models
pretty much every day,

1:18:50.977 --> 1:18:54.105
so I forget it’s...
it’s out of the ordinary.

1:18:54.188 --> 1:18:57.108
But if you’re not comfortable,
it’s cool.

1:19:00.695 --> 1:19:04.282
No, it’s-it’s... it’s fine.

1:19:04.407 --> 1:19:06.117
Um...

1:19:06.242 --> 1:19:08.119
just, like...

1:19:10.329 --> 1:19:12.457
-Cute.
-

1:19:12.540 --> 1:19:14.584
Mind if I snap a few?

1:19:24.719 --> 1:19:26.721
Uh, let me.

1:19:33.019 --> 1:19:35.062
-PIPPA: Um.

1:19:35.188 --> 1:19:36.939
I wasn’t ready.

1:19:37.023 --> 1:19:40.067
I tend to take my best pictures
when you least expect it.

1:19:46.365 --> 1:19:48.618
-Now what?
-

1:19:49.452 --> 1:19:51.412
What about your underwear?

1:20:11.224 --> 1:20:13.267
Turn away from me.

1:20:15.102 --> 1:20:16.521
Okay.

1:20:16.604 --> 1:20:18.940
You have a magnificent body.

1:20:19.023 --> 1:20:20.816
-

1:20:20.900 --> 1:20:22.568
Thank you.

1:20:23.402 --> 1:20:24.529
Eyes to me.

1:20:24.654 --> 1:20:26.405
-Chin up slightly.

1:20:26.489 --> 1:20:29.283
That’s it.
Now take off your bra.

1:20:32.078 --> 1:20:32.995
Okay.

1:20:33.120 --> 1:20:35.206
I’ll make it less awkward.

1:20:37.500 --> 1:20:38.626
What are you doing?

1:20:38.751 --> 1:20:40.962
What does it look like?

1:20:56.102 --> 1:20:58.563
-Nice socks.
-Thanks.

1:21:06.320 --> 1:21:08.322
Your turn.

1:21:55.036 --> 1:21:57.413
What the fuck am I doing?

1:22:03.461 --> 1:22:05.463
What’s wrong?

1:22:05.546 --> 1:22:08.090
You just...
you know, you just...

1:22:08.174 --> 1:22:10.676
you just remind me of someone.
That’s all.

1:22:12.678 --> 1:22:14.764
I’m so sorry.

1:22:14.847 --> 1:22:17.183
No, it’s not your fault.

1:23:32.299 --> 1:23:33.843
Uh, s-s-stop.

1:23:33.968 --> 1:23:35.594
Stop, stop, stop.

1:23:38.514 --> 1:23:40.933
Um, go, go get a condom.

1:25:49.311 --> 1:25:51.021
Pippa?

1:26:01.991 --> 1:26:04.326
Oh, that’s fucking disgusting.

1:26:09.874 --> 1:26:11.458
Here you go, guys.

1:26:11.542 --> 1:26:13.419
It’s good for you.

1:27:30.746 --> 1:27:33.207
- Fuck.

1:28:20.212 --> 1:28:22.506
-

1:29:37.748 --> 1:29:39.249
PIPPA:
And...

1:29:39.333 --> 1:29:42.336
the next morning, that’s...

1:29:42.419 --> 1:29:44.713
that’s when I found him.

1:29:44.797 --> 1:29:47.800
I-I had to tell you.

1:29:49.051 --> 1:29:51.261
I had to tell someone.

1:29:52.930 --> 1:29:56.016
I understand if you never
want to talk to me again.

1:29:59.728 --> 1:30:01.688
Wait.

1:30:01.772 --> 1:30:04.191
Pippa, you think
this is your fault?

1:30:04.274 --> 1:30:06.318
I’m the reason it all happened.

1:30:06.443 --> 1:30:09.488
You cannot blame yourself
for this.

1:30:09.571 --> 1:30:11.448
I caused the whole thing to...

1:30:11.532 --> 1:30:13.200
No, no, no.
Yes, it is tragic.

1:30:13.325 --> 1:30:15.744
It’s more than tragic--
it is fucking insane--

1:30:15.828 --> 1:30:17.996
but you had no idea
that this would happen.

1:30:18.080 --> 1:30:19.915
I mean, you were just dumped.

1:30:19.998 --> 1:30:22.000
And yeah, maybe you deserved it.

1:30:22.084 --> 1:30:23.168
That part doesn’t matter.

1:30:23.293 --> 1:30:25.212
You are a single woman.

1:30:25.337 --> 1:30:27.381
And it is common knowledge
that the fastest way

1:30:27.464 --> 1:30:30.467
to mend a broken heart
is to do the most unhealthy,

1:30:30.551 --> 1:30:33.470
fucked-up shit
you can possibly think of.

1:30:33.554 --> 1:30:34.888
Yeah, okay, maybe doing it with

1:30:34.972 --> 1:30:36.431
the depressed widower
that you’re stalking

1:30:36.515 --> 1:30:38.100
is a bit, like,
at the extreme end of that,

1:30:38.183 --> 1:30:40.352
but it is part of the deal.

1:30:41.186 --> 1:30:43.856
It just... it doesn’t feel real.

1:30:45.065 --> 1:30:46.692
ARI:
Hey.

1:30:46.817 --> 1:30:49.528
You are so super fucked-up
right now,

1:30:49.611 --> 1:30:52.531
and you better seek therapy
like tomorrow.

1:30:53.740 --> 1:30:56.410
But you’re a good person, Pippa.

1:30:56.493 --> 1:30:59.830
Even if it doesn’t
feel like that right now.

1:31:01.874 --> 1:31:05.210
If I’m such a good person,
why do I want to see him again?

1:31:05.294 --> 1:31:07.129
He’s, like, disappeared.

1:31:07.254 --> 1:31:12.885
I know it sounds irrational,
but if I could just see him,

1:31:12.968 --> 1:31:15.512
maybe I could move on.
I...

1:31:19.224 --> 1:31:21.518
It’s stupid. I know.

1:31:22.436 --> 1:31:24.271
Okay.

1:31:25.522 --> 1:31:27.816
Well, if he’s not at home,

1:31:27.900 --> 1:31:30.110
where do you think he is?

1:31:33.488 --> 1:31:34.990
Pippa?

1:31:36.700 --> 1:31:38.619
It’s opening night.

1:31:51.840 --> 1:31:55.510
back on the ground

1:31:57.137 --> 1:31:58.388
Drink?

1:31:58.513 --> 1:31:59.765
Sure.

1:31:59.890 --> 1:32:02.226
-

1:32:02.309 --> 1:32:05.103
to have it figured out...

1:32:05.187 --> 1:32:07.022
SEB:
I didn’t think you’d come.

1:32:07.105 --> 1:32:09.274
PIPPA:
I came.

1:32:09.399 --> 1:32:10.817
This is...

1:32:10.901 --> 1:32:12.527
really cool.

1:32:12.611 --> 1:32:14.238
I can’t wait to see the photos.

1:32:14.363 --> 1:32:15.364
Cool.

1:32:15.447 --> 1:32:17.783
Yeah, it’s really fucking cool.

1:32:22.955 --> 1:32:25.332
-Are you okay?
-WOMAN: Seb.

1:32:25.415 --> 1:32:28.085
That’s my cue.
Thanks for coming.

1:32:30.879 --> 1:32:33.340
ARI:
A-- thanks for introducing me.

1:32:33.423 --> 1:32:36.802
And B-- like,
not what I pictured.

1:32:50.524 --> 1:32:53.402
Now, before we begin,

1:32:53.527 --> 1:32:56.780
I should say that
this particular project

1:32:56.863 --> 1:32:58.907
was a collaboration.

1:33:01.660 --> 1:33:03.912
My partner in crime on this...

1:33:03.996 --> 1:33:06.248
the love of my life...

1:33:06.373 --> 1:33:08.959
Julia Novatore.

1:33:10.794 --> 1:33:11.962
So...

1:33:12.045 --> 1:33:13.672
-I really want to go home.
-Okay.

1:33:13.797 --> 1:33:16.341
...it seems only right that
she should be up here with me.

1:33:16.425 --> 1:33:18.302
Everyone, Julia.

1:33:20.470 --> 1:33:22.306
Come on.

1:33:39.573 --> 1:33:43.744
This new exhibition tells
a modern fable.

1:33:43.827 --> 1:33:45.954
It’s a tragic tale

1:33:46.038 --> 1:33:49.291
of a sweet young woman
named Pippa.

1:33:56.673 --> 1:33:58.759
Oh, my God.

1:34:05.349 --> 1:34:08.101
Pippa lives in
the apartment we own

1:34:08.185 --> 1:34:10.312
across the way from our studio.

1:34:11.646 --> 1:34:14.149
When she and her boyfriend
Thomas

1:34:14.232 --> 1:34:16.693
first moved in together,
their future was bright.

1:34:16.777 --> 1:34:19.613
Things were...
things were downright peachy.

1:34:20.947 --> 1:34:22.741
Then they got
a little distracted

1:34:22.824 --> 1:34:25.285
by the strangers across the way.

1:34:25.410 --> 1:34:26.953
Us.

1:34:27.079 --> 1:34:30.499
They cared more about
what was going on

1:34:30.582 --> 1:34:32.793
in other people’s lives
than they did their own.

1:34:32.876 --> 1:34:35.462
And what started out
as a fun little hobby

1:34:35.587 --> 1:34:37.672
turned into a bit
of an obsession.

1:34:39.174 --> 1:34:40.759
They gate-crashed
our Halloween party

1:34:40.842 --> 1:34:42.344
and planted a microphone

1:34:42.427 --> 1:34:45.305
so they could secretly
listen in on our conversations.

1:34:45.389 --> 1:34:48.016
Uh, totally illegal, by the way.

1:34:49.267 --> 1:34:52.729
And yet, somehow,
Pippa decided that she was...

1:34:52.813 --> 1:34:54.815
she was doing the right thing.

1:34:55.649 --> 1:34:58.026
First, this tore them apart
emotionally.

1:34:58.110 --> 1:35:00.529
And then...
it tore them apart forever.

1:35:00.612 --> 1:35:03.198
-

1:35:11.289 --> 1:35:13.333
SEB:
Little did she realize,

1:35:13.417 --> 1:35:16.753
the whole time that
they were watching us...

1:35:16.837 --> 1:35:19.172
We were really watching them.

1:35:28.473 --> 1:35:30.684
-Pippa!
-

1:35:30.809 --> 1:35:32.769
Pippa!

1:37:54.327 --> 1:37:56.246
Yep. Those are my boobs.

1:37:56.329 --> 1:37:58.957
This is the place.

1:38:55.305 --> 1:38:57.432
SEB: This is the image
release form they signed.

1:38:57.515 --> 1:39:00.018
It’s the last page
of their lease.

1:39:00.143 --> 1:39:02.395
Plain and simple.

1:39:02.520 --> 1:39:05.649
Now, do I know
if they actually read it?

1:39:05.774 --> 1:39:07.192
No.

1:39:07.275 --> 1:39:10.070
But that’s not
my responsibility.

1:39:10.153 --> 1:39:12.322
Let me ask you this.

1:39:12.405 --> 1:39:14.574
How many times this week
has something popped up

1:39:14.658 --> 1:39:16.618
on your computer screen saying,

1:39:16.701 --> 1:39:18.495
"Please agree
to the terms and conditions,"

1:39:18.578 --> 1:39:22.332
and you’ve just clicked yes and
not even thought twice about it?

1:39:22.415 --> 1:39:24.584
I mean, it’s something
we’ve grown accustomed to, no?

1:39:29.589 --> 1:39:31.675
TRANSLATOR: But does that
give you the right to, uh...

1:39:31.758 --> 1:39:33.259
Oh, uh... it’s tragic.

1:39:33.385 --> 1:39:36.221
And we both feel so horrible
about it, don’t we, Seb?

1:39:36.346 --> 1:39:38.348
-Of course.
-But if anything,

1:39:38.431 --> 1:39:41.059
it’s a warning, because
it’s unprecedented, really,

1:39:41.142 --> 1:39:43.853
the access we give people
into our lives today.

1:39:43.978 --> 1:39:46.898
It is entirely
socially acceptable--

1:39:47.023 --> 1:39:49.317
no, socially expected--
for us to be able

1:39:49.442 --> 1:39:51.403
to stalk people
we may or may not know

1:39:51.486 --> 1:39:52.987
in order to get a glimpse into

1:39:53.071 --> 1:39:55.281
that partially true version
of their lives.

1:39:56.116 --> 1:39:58.368
Seb and I lived
a version of our life

1:39:58.451 --> 1:40:00.578
for Pippa and Thomas to see.

1:40:00.662 --> 1:40:02.122
Yes, we created
our own narrative

1:40:02.205 --> 1:40:04.749
and made it available
for them to watch.

1:40:04.833 --> 1:40:07.252
We gave them front-row seats.

1:40:10.380 --> 1:40:12.507
They tuned right in.

1:40:13.633 --> 1:40:16.052
All we had to do was watch back.

1:40:20.265 --> 1:40:21.891
...Berlin, Copenhagen...

1:40:23.393 --> 1:40:25.353
TRANSLATOR: So, uh,
in addition to premiering

1:40:25.437 --> 1:40:27.814
-internationally in Tokyo...
-Everywhere.

1:40:27.939 --> 1:40:30.108
We’ve sold it everywhere.
It’s a rousing success.

1:40:30.233 --> 1:40:33.153
We’re now the toast of the
art community, and guess what--

1:40:33.278 --> 1:40:36.072
we made a disgusting amount
of money in the process.

1:40:37.115 --> 1:40:40.702
Now, do you have anything
actually interesting to ask us?

1:40:53.339 --> 1:40:55.842
JULIA: How many times
can someone be congratulated?

1:40:55.925 --> 1:40:57.552
Oh, your favorite.

1:41:00.138 --> 1:41:01.931
"Scass-er-y."

1:41:02.056 --> 1:41:03.641
Scassari.

1:41:04.517 --> 1:41:05.602
Who sent it?

1:41:05.727 --> 1:41:07.437
Um...

1:41:08.521 --> 1:41:10.607
"So thrilled to be featuring
The Voyeurs

1:41:10.690 --> 1:41:13.318
in our upcoming season."

1:41:13.443 --> 1:41:15.403
The Tate.

1:41:17.155 --> 1:41:18.948
Oh, that’s great.

1:41:28.124 --> 1:41:29.542
Baby.

1:41:29.667 --> 1:41:31.836
You have to get over this.

1:41:41.095 --> 1:41:43.973
Don’t you ever feel guilty?

1:41:48.353 --> 1:41:50.271
No.

1:42:45.076 --> 1:42:46.244
Up there.

1:42:48.329 --> 1:42:50.081
What is she doing?

1:42:50.206 --> 1:42:52.000
SEB:
She’s fucking lost it.

1:42:52.083 --> 1:42:54.878
JULIA: What do you think
you know, Pippa?

1:43:03.469 --> 1:43:05.430
Pippa!

1:43:23.823 --> 1:43:25.783
We just want to talk to you.

1:43:35.585 --> 1:43:37.420
-Hey!
-

1:44:00.902 --> 1:44:02.236
Please.

1:44:02.320 --> 1:44:05.365
Is all this really
necessary, Pippa?

1:44:05.448 --> 1:44:06.866
Just... just leave me alone.

1:44:06.950 --> 1:44:08.409
SEB: What is it that
you think you know?

1:44:08.534 --> 1:44:09.911
I-I don’t... I don’t...
I don’t know.

1:44:09.994 --> 1:44:11.746
These are some
pretty serious accusations.

1:44:11.871 --> 1:44:14.040
They must have come
from somewhere.

1:44:15.583 --> 1:44:17.543
Stop fucking us around.

1:44:25.969 --> 1:44:28.012
PIPPA:
When I... when I watched you,

1:44:28.137 --> 1:44:30.348
I believed every moment.

1:44:33.351 --> 1:44:35.311
Even though none of it was real.

1:44:37.230 --> 1:44:39.732
But when Thomas died,

1:44:39.857 --> 1:44:42.944
it didn’t feel true,
but he’s still gone.

1:44:46.948 --> 1:44:49.534
He would’ve never done that.

1:44:49.617 --> 1:44:52.453
And I don’t know for sure,
but I think you drugged him.

1:44:56.249 --> 1:44:58.793
And then you made it look
like he did it himself.

1:45:00.920 --> 1:45:03.214
JULIA: That is a hell
of a theory, Pippa.

1:45:03.297 --> 1:45:06.050
Do you have any proof?

1:45:06.175 --> 1:45:07.593
No.

1:45:07.677 --> 1:45:09.470
Then what are we all doing here?

1:45:10.972 --> 1:45:13.266
You manipulated me.

1:45:13.391 --> 1:45:15.643
You seduced me.

1:45:16.561 --> 1:45:18.354
You exposed me.

1:45:18.438 --> 1:45:23.234
And you think you could
hurt me again, but you can’t.

1:45:23.317 --> 1:45:25.737
Because I have nothing left.

1:45:26.738 --> 1:45:28.781
So I just need to know
this one last thing,

1:45:28.906 --> 1:45:31.409
and then you’ll never
see me again.

1:45:33.661 --> 1:45:35.872
How could you do this?

1:45:36.914 --> 1:45:38.750
We, uh... we didn’t.

1:45:38.875 --> 1:45:40.585
JULIA:
It was you who told me--

1:45:40.710 --> 1:45:45.006
it’s like when you’re
so obsessed with something

1:45:45.131 --> 1:45:48.551
that you forget to pick your
head up, look around and go,

1:45:48.634 --> 1:45:52.013
"Oh, wait.
What am I even doing?"

1:45:52.096 --> 1:45:54.682
But you’re too far down the...

1:46:02.732 --> 1:46:04.984
You’re too fa...

1:46:08.071 --> 1:46:09.405
Seb.

1:46:09.489 --> 1:46:11.699
-SEB: What’s...
-

1:46:11.783 --> 1:46:12.784
SEB:
Julia.

1:46:12.909 --> 1:46:14.077
Hey.

1:46:14.160 --> 1:46:15.536
Hey, talk to me.

1:46:15.620 --> 1:46:17.747
What’s wrong?
What’s wrong, baby?

1:46:17.872 --> 1:46:19.749
Come on. Come on.

1:46:19.874 --> 1:46:21.834
Baby, what...

1:46:22.710 --> 1:46:24.003
What did you do?

1:46:24.087 --> 1:46:26.214
You weigh a little bit more,

1:46:26.297 --> 1:46:28.549
so it might take a minute
to kick in.

1:46:31.552 --> 1:46:33.763
What the fuck did you do?

1:46:36.057 --> 1:46:38.893
That wine was
a little gift from me.

1:46:44.315 --> 1:46:47.485
Look at me. Look at me!

1:46:48.361 --> 1:46:50.780
Take one final look.

1:46:50.905 --> 1:46:53.825
’Cause it’s the last thing
you’re ever gonna see.

1:47:45.626 --> 1:47:47.044
MAN:
Our first breakfast.

1:47:48.546 --> 1:47:51.215
Not a bad view.

1:47:55.970 --> 1:47:58.014
You can really see in.

1:47:59.932 --> 1:48:02.476
Are you creeping
on our neighbors?

1:48:04.604 --> 1:48:07.440
Look at those two.
What are they doing?

1:48:07.565 --> 1:48:08.774
Where?

1:48:08.858 --> 1:48:10.568
Honey, right there.

1:48:14.071 --> 1:48:16.616
I really got to get
my eyes checked.

1:48:17.783 --> 1:48:19.827
Mind your own business.

1:50:25.953 --> 1:50:28.789
and said

1:50:29.957 --> 1:50:33.044
to you after you left that day

1:50:33.127 --> 1:50:36.297
I was really..."

1:50:41.844 --> 1:50:47.516
on the phone

1:50:53.230 --> 1:50:58.694
you’re alone

1:51:04.617 --> 1:51:09.747
you’re alone
