♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:07.750 --> 00:08.959
HE JUST WATCHES HER.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.041
AND I SEE HIM SOMETIMES.

00:10.083 --> 00:11.208
HE JUST WATCHES HER.

00:11.250 --> 00:13.041
HE WORRIES ABOUT HER
ALL NIGHT LONG.

00:13.083 --> 00:15.500
(man) SHE'S HIS SISTER.

00:15.542 --> 00:17.041
I KNOW SHE'S HIS--

00:17.083 --> 00:19.166
(laughs) I'M NOT JEALOUS
OF HER. I'M--

00:19.208 --> 00:20.834
YOU'RE WHAT?

00:20.875 --> 00:22.875
I DON'T KNOW. I SEE...

00:22.917 --> 00:25.166
GREAT LOVE...

00:25.208 --> 00:27.583

00:34.583 --> 00:36.834
PEOPLE GOING THROUGH
SO MUCH,

00:36.875 --> 00:38.208
AND GO THROUGH IT TOGETHER.

00:38.250 --> 00:40.834
THEY SACRIFICE FOR EACH OTHER.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.375
THEY--THEY CHOOSE
EACH OTHER.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.250
YOU'RE SAYING SAM
DIDN'T CHOOSE YOU?

00:44.291 --> 00:46.041
HE DIDN'T SACRIFICE
FOR YOU?

00:46.083 --> 00:48.417
NO, I'M SAYING...

00:48.458 --> 00:51.458
I THOUGHT SAM WAS...

00:51.500 --> 00:54.083
MY GREATEST LOVE...
YOU KNOW?

00:54.125 --> 00:57.709
AND TH-THERE ARE MOMENTS
WHEN I...

00:57.750 --> 01:01.458
BUT MOSTLY, I JUST
WORRY ABOUT HIM NOW.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.834
AND I LOVE HIM.

01:03.875 --> 01:06.834
AND SOMETIMES,
I GET MAD AT HIM, WHICH...

01:06.875 --> 01:10.000
I DON'T KNOW,
I GUESS THAT--

IT WASN'T A SURPRISE.

02:08.083 --> 02:09.709
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
HAD YOU WATCHED THEM

02:09.750 --> 02:11.667
IN THE CORRECT ORDER.
I DID.

02:11.709 --> 02:13.041
WE STARTED WITH "EPISODE I."

02:13.083 --> 02:15.041
"EPISODE I" IS NOT

I'M BRINGING THEM
OVER TONIGHT.

OH, I'LL GET IT.
I'LL GET IT. I'LL GET IT.

02:31.709 --> 02:33.583
WHAT HAPPENED?
NOTHING, HONEY.

02:33.625 --> 02:34.792
I JUST, UM, SPILLED.

02:34.834 --> 02:36.041
SIT, SIT, SIT.

02:36.083 --> 02:37.083

HONEY, WHY DON'T YOU GO GET
YOUR STUFF FOR SCHOOL?

02:47.083 --> 02:48.625
OKAY.

02:48.667 --> 02:51.750
WHAT DO WE SAY WHEN...

02:51.792 --> 02:53.834

03:00.750 --> 03:02.709

PUT THAT HAM
ON TOP OF THE WAFFLE

03:06.834 --> 03:08.083
AND THEN THE EGG
ON TOP OF THAT?

03:08.125 --> 03:10.041
YEP, AND THEN HOT SAUCE
ON TOP OF THAT.

03:10.083 --> 03:12.125
YOU HEARD OF
EGGS BENEDICT, RIGHT?

03:12.166 --> 03:14.208

WHAT TIME'S YOUR APPOINTMENT
WITH DR. WALLACE?

03:18.041 --> 03:20.583
I WANT TO GO
TO THE PLANETARIUM.

03:20.625 --> 03:22.125
HAVE YOU BEEN THERE...

03:22.166 --> 03:23.375
UNH-UNH.

03:23.417 --> 03:25.041
TO THE OBSERVATORY?
(laughs)

03:25.083 --> 03:27.834
REMEMBER HOW WE USED TO CRAWL
OUT OF YOUR BEDROOM WINDOW

03:27.875 --> 03:31.041
AND LIE ON THE ROOF
AND STARE AT THE STARS?

03:31.083 --> 03:32.375
YEP, AND YOU USED TO
MAKE UP NAMES

03:32.417 --> 03:34.041
FOR ALL THE CONSTELLATIONS--

03:34.083 --> 03:35.625
THE BIG FLOPPER...
(laughs)

03:35.667 --> 03:36.834
AND ORION'S COOKIE.

03:36.875 --> 03:37.959
(laughs)

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT A LOT

03:40.041 --> 03:41.834
WHILE I WAS OUT THERE.

03:41.875 --> 03:43.834
ON WARM NIGHTS,
I WOULD LIE ON THE BEACH

03:43.875 --> 03:46.041
AND NAME THE CONSTELLATIONS

03:46.083 --> 03:48.875
OUT LOUD, LIKE I WAS
DOING IT FOR YOU,

03:48.917 --> 03:51.834
WHICH PROBABLY MADE ME SEEM

03:51.875 --> 03:53.667
EVEN CRAZIER THAN I AM.

03:53.709 --> 03:55.834
THAN YOU WERE.

03:55.875 --> 03:57.834
THAN YOU WERE.

03:57.875 --> 03:59.625
ALL RIGHT, HOW ABOUT THIS?

03:59.667 --> 04:01.041
YOU GO SEE DR. WALLACE,
AND, UH,

04:01.083 --> 04:02.625
I'LL MAKE A FEW CALLS,

04:02.667 --> 04:04.041
WRAP A FEW THINGS UP
AT THE OFFICE,

04:04.083 --> 04:05.834
THEN WE CAN GO TO
THE PLANETARIUM TOGETHER?

04:05.875 --> 04:07.834
IN THE MIDDLE
OF YOUR WORK DAY?

04:07.875 --> 04:09.667
THEY OWE ME SOME TIME OFF.

04:13.208 --> 04:15.709
HIT IT.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.417
(indistinct conversations)

04:17.458 --> 04:19.834
HEY. I ORDERED
SOME BREAKFAST TACOS.

04:19.875 --> 04:21.834
THEY'LL BE HERE IN A MINUTE.
YOU WANT ONE?

04:21.875 --> 04:24.041
UH, I THINK I'LL PASS.

04:24.083 --> 04:26.542
YOU DON'T LOOK WELL.

04:26.583 --> 04:28.542
WELL, THAT'S VERY KIND
OF YOU.

04:28.583 --> 04:30.041
(laughs) OH, NO. I WASN'T
TRYING TO INSULT YOU. I...

04:30.083 --> 04:31.834
(elevator bell dings)
I'M JUST A LITTLE RUN DOWN.

04:31.875 --> 04:33.208
BUT THANKS.

04:33.250 --> 04:34.458
YEAH.

04:34.500 --> 04:35.959
HEY, DR. WALLACE.

04:36.000 --> 04:36.917
(Sam whispers)
ADDISON.

04:36.959 --> 04:38.208
OH, CORINNE. HEY.
YOU READY?

04:38.250 --> 04:39.542
HI.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.542
SO... HOW MUCH TIME
ARE YOU GONNA TAKE OFF?

04:41.583 --> 04:43.041
UH, THANK YOU.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.709
AS LONG AS CORINNE NEEDS
TO GET BACK UP ON HER FEET.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.667
HOW'S SHE DOING?

04:47.709 --> 04:49.041
SHE'S DOING GOOD.

04:49.083 --> 04:51.750
IT'S, UH... IT'S LIKE
A LITTLE BIT MORE OF HER

04:51.792 --> 04:54.458
COMES BACK TO ME EVERY DAY.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.917
THAT'S GREAT, SAM,
REALLY.

04:55.959 --> 04:57.458
THANK YOU.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.166
(indistinct conversations
continue)

04:59.208 --> 05:01.792
OH, HEY.

05:01.834 --> 05:04.041
UH, WE...

05:04.083 --> 05:05.458
WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE

05:05.500 --> 05:07.792
TO FINISH TALKING
THE OTHER DAY.

05:07.834 --> 05:09.041
ABOUT WHAT?

05:09.083 --> 05:11.041
UM...

05:11.083 --> 05:12.166
US.

05:12.208 --> 05:13.917
OUR...

05:13.959 --> 05:15.458
US.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.750
OH, I--YEAH. I WAS--
I WAS FINISHED.

05:17.792 --> 05:20.542
YOU WEREN'T FINISHED?
I'M--I'M ALL EARS.

05:20.583 --> 05:22.917
I... UH, OH, I--

05:22.959 --> 05:25.291
I GUESS--NO, I...

05:25.333 --> 05:27.625
WAS FINISHED.

05:30.750 --> 05:33.750
(people speaking indistinctly)

05:36.417 --> 05:38.041
IT'S STILL HARD TO BELIEVE
WE'RE HAVING TWINS.

05:38.083 --> 05:39.583
I KNOW. OH.

05:39.625 --> 05:41.041
I GOT SOME TEDDY BEAR BUMPERS
FOR THE BOY CRIB.

05:41.083 --> 05:42.417
AND I'M TRYING TO GO
GENDER NEUTRAL WITH SARAH'S,

05:42.458 --> 05:44.041
BUT YOU'RE NOT MAKING IT EASY.
DON'T DO THAT.

05:44.083 --> 05:45.041
DON'T CALL HER THAT.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.083
SORRY. SHE HATES IT
WHEN I USE HER NAME.

05:46.125 --> 05:47.333
BECAUSE IT'S NOT HER NAME.

05:47.375 --> 05:49.500
YEAH, BUT BOTH HAVE GRANDMOTHERS
NAMED SARAH,

05:49.542 --> 05:51.375
SO IT DOES SEEM LIKE
A NATURAL CHOICE--
IT'S BAD LUCK TO NAME A BABY
BEFORE ITS BORN.

05:51.417 --> 05:52.709
OH, WHATEVER.

05:52.750 --> 05:54.083
(exhales)

05:54.125 --> 05:57.041
(clicks keyboard keys)

05:57.083 --> 06:00.458
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

06:00.500 --> 06:01.959
OH, JUST...

06:02.000 --> 06:03.417
OH, NO.

06:03.458 --> 06:05.625
I AM SORRY.

06:05.667 --> 06:09.041
BUT YOUR BOY HAS A SEVERE
DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA.

06:09.083 --> 06:11.041
WHAT--WHAT--WHAT IS--
IS THAT BAD?

06:11.083 --> 06:13.041
IT'S A CONGENITAL BIRTH DEFECT

06:13.083 --> 06:15.041
THAT KEEPS THE BABY'S LUNGS
FROM FORMING PROPERLY.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.667
CAN YOU FIX IT
ONCE HE'S BORN?

06:16.709 --> 06:18.041
IF HE IS BORN

06:18.083 --> 06:19.166
WITH THIS, AT BEST,

06:19.208 --> 06:22.375
HIS QUALITY OF LIFE WILL BE
GREATLY DIMINISHED.

06:22.417 --> 06:24.041
OKAY.

06:24.083 --> 06:26.041
I-I'VE SEEN ON THOSE
MEDICAL SHOWS, THEY--

06:26.083 --> 06:27.959
THEY DO SURGERY WHILE THE BABY'S
STILL IN THE WOMB.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.500
YES, THEY CAN, AND I DO.

06:29.542 --> 06:31.500
I'VE HAD SUCCESS TREATING
DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIAS...
OH.

06:31.542 --> 06:34.500
WITH IN UTERO SURGERY,
BUT YOU ARE CARRYING TWINS.

06:34.542 --> 06:37.250
WELL, WHY IS THAT--
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

06:37.291 --> 06:38.500
(sighs)

06:38.542 --> 06:40.291
IF I DO SURGERY ON YOUR BOY
IN UTERO,

06:40.333 --> 06:42.792
IT CREATES A VERY SERIOUS RISK
FOR THE GIRL.

06:42.834 --> 06:44.417
OH, GOD.

06:44.458 --> 06:46.709
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE--
WE JUST--

06:46.750 --> 06:49.041
WE DO NOTHING
AND WE LOSE OUR BOY?

06:49.083 --> 06:50.625
OR WE DO SURGERY

06:50.667 --> 06:53.250
AND POSSIBLY LOSE THEM BOTH.

07:02.458 --> 07:05.041
OH, HEY, THEY OPENED
A NEW REPTILE HOUSE AT THE ZOO.

07:05.083 --> 07:07.125
YOU THINK LUCAS MIGHT WANT
TO GO DOWN THERE

07:07.166 --> 07:08.917
AND CHECK OUT
THE KOMODO DRAGONS?

07:08.959 --> 07:10.917
I THINK LUCAS WOULD LIKE TO
LIVE WITH THE KOMODO DRAGONS.

07:10.959 --> 07:13.041
(laughs) WELL, MAYBE I'LL
CUT OUT EARLY TODAY

07:13.083 --> 07:14.250
AND TAKE HIM OVER.

07:14.291 --> 07:16.083
I COULD GO WITH YOU.
I MEAN, IF...

07:16.125 --> 07:17.875
YEAH, SURE.

07:17.917 --> 07:19.041
WE'LL LEAVE ABOUT 4:00.

07:19.083 --> 07:20.125
(Addison sighs)

07:20.166 --> 07:21.417
I HATE THIS DAY.

07:21.458 --> 07:22.667
LOOK, IF DOING SURGERY ON HIM

07:22.709 --> 07:24.875
PUTS HIS HEALTHY SISTER
AT SERIOUS RISK--

07:24.917 --> 07:26.083
OH, HOW DO YOU MAKE
THAT CALL?

07:26.125 --> 07:27.875
LET ONE OF YOUR KIDS DIE

07:27.917 --> 07:29.083
OR RISK THE HEALTHY ONE
TO SAVE THE SICK ONE?

07:29.125 --> 07:31.625
MM. JUST THE KIND OF HAPPY TALK
I LOOK FORWARD TO

07:31.667 --> 07:33.041
WITH MY MIDMORNING TEA.

07:33.083 --> 07:35.667
I DON'T MAKE THAT CALL.
THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE CALL--

07:35.709 --> 07:37.875
THIS FUNNY, HAPPY COUPLE

07:37.917 --> 07:39.250
WHO SPENT A LONG TIME

07:39.291 --> 07:42.083
AND A LOT OF BLOOD, SWEAT,
AND TEARS TO MAKE THESE BABIES.

07:42.125 --> 07:44.041
UGH. I HATE THIS DAY.

07:44.083 --> 07:45.750
ARE YOU REALLY
GONNA GIVE THEM A CHOICE?

07:45.792 --> 07:47.041
FETAL SURGERY
WITH A TWIN PREGNANCY,

07:47.083 --> 07:48.041
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

07:48.083 --> 07:49.500
MAYBE.
LOOK, ADDISON,

07:49.542 --> 07:52.083
PUTTING A BALLOON
INTO A FETUS' TRACHEA

07:52.125 --> 07:53.500
IN THIS SITUATION
WITH A TWIN PREGNANCY,

07:53.542 --> 07:54.750
IT'S A HUGE RISK.

07:54.792 --> 07:56.500
THE AMNIOTIC MEMBRANES
COULD SEPARATE.

07:56.542 --> 07:59.166
THERE COULD BE BLEEDS,
PREMATURE LABOR.

07:59.208 --> 08:00.959
BUT SHE COULD SAVE
BOTH BABIES, RIGHT?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.166
I COULD.

08:02.208 --> 08:03.709
IT'S POSSIBLE.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.250
IT'S RISKY,
BUT I COULD.

08:05.291 --> 08:07.333
I MEAN, ADDIE'S A ROCK STAR
WITH A SCOPE.

08:07.375 --> 08:09.375
IF SHE SAYS SHE CAN DO IT,
I WOULD NOT BET AGAINST HER.

08:09.417 --> 08:10.917
I'M NOT BETTING
AGAINST HER. I'M JUST--

08:10.959 --> 08:12.041
HEY, HEY, WILL YOU
TALK TO THEM FOR ME?

08:12.083 --> 08:13.375
WILL YOU HELP THEM DECIDE?

08:13.417 --> 08:14.917
S-SURE.

08:14.959 --> 08:16.041
ADDISON, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE MAKING THIS MESSY.

08:16.083 --> 08:17.375
I'M NOT MAKING IT MESSY.
I'M GIVING THEM OPTIONS.

08:17.417 --> 08:18.917
VIOLET HERE IS GONNA DEAL
WITH THE MESS.

08:18.959 --> 08:20.917
NOW YOU CAN HATE
THIS DAY, TOO.

08:20.959 --> 08:23.041
THANKS FOR THAT.

08:23.083 --> 08:25.583
(people speaking indistinctly)

08:25.625 --> 08:26.834
(Charlotte) COOPER.

08:26.875 --> 08:28.375
(thumps)
EVERYTHING'S GOOD.

08:28.417 --> 08:30.125
YOU HAVE A SOFA.
YOU COULD TAKE A NAP ON IT.

08:30.166 --> 08:31.625
EVERYBODY'D UNDERSTAND--

08:31.667 --> 08:34.000
NO, NO, NO, I'M TOTALLY AWAKE.
I'M CHARTING.

08:34.041 --> 08:35.917
HOW'S ERICA THIS MORNING?

08:35.959 --> 08:39.041
FINE. YOU KNOW,
I MEAN... FRUSTRATED.

08:39.083 --> 08:42.041
RECOVERY'S NOT GOING
AS FAST AS SHE WOULD LIKE.

08:42.083 --> 08:43.458
IT'S TAKING ITS TOLL
ON MASON.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.041
IT'S TAKING ITS TOLL
ON YOU, TOO.

08:45.083 --> 08:46.375
I AM FINE.

08:46.417 --> 08:47.750
I CAN DO THIS.

08:47.792 --> 08:49.041
I DON'T DOUBT
THAT YOU COULD DO IT.

08:49.083 --> 08:52.291
IT'S JUST...
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

08:54.291 --> 08:56.250
HAVE YOU BEEN KEEPING TRACK
OF YOUR MOODS

08:56.291 --> 08:58.166
IN A JOURNAL
LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT?

08:58.208 --> 08:59.959
YEAH, OF COURSE.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.166
SAM TOLD ME I SHOULD WRITE DOWN
MORE THAN JUST MY MOODS.

09:03.208 --> 09:06.250
HE SAID IT MIGHT
HELP ME PROCESS

09:06.291 --> 09:09.041
WHAT I'M FEELING
OR THINKING,

09:09.083 --> 09:12.959
TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND
BEFORE I REACT.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.333
IS IT HELPING?

09:14.375 --> 09:16.041
YEAH, I THINK SO.

09:16.083 --> 09:17.917
I MEAN, I-I KNOW
IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME,

09:17.959 --> 09:21.166
BUT I'M FEELING FOCUSED.

09:21.208 --> 09:23.875
MY MIND IS...

09:23.917 --> 09:25.625
IT'S LIKE A FOG
HAS LIFTED.

09:25.667 --> 09:27.083
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

09:27.125 --> 09:29.875
YOU SHOULD FEEL PROUD
OF YOUR PROGRESS.

09:29.917 --> 09:33.583
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE
TALK ABOUT YOUR EXPECTATIONS.

09:33.625 --> 09:36.792
SAM THINKS I SHOULD GET
A PART-TIME JOB,

09:36.834 --> 09:40.041
MAYBE VOLUNTEER
AT THE HOMELESS SHELTER.

09:40.083 --> 09:42.041
YOU KNOW,
TO KEEP MYSELF BUSY

09:42.083 --> 09:45.041
SO I DON'T GET TOO PREOCCUPIED
WITH MY THOUGHTS.

09:45.083 --> 09:47.041
IS THAT
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?

09:47.083 --> 09:50.041
WELL, SAM'S TAKING TIME OFF
TO BE WITH ME,

09:50.083 --> 09:53.041
TO MAKE SURE I HAVE
EVERYTHING I NEED.

09:53.083 --> 09:55.041
BUT, UM...

09:55.083 --> 09:59.083
HE CAN'T ALWAYS
BE WITH ME AND...

10:00.083 --> 10:01.709
AND WHAT,

10:01.750 --> 10:03.041
CORINNE?

10:03.083 --> 10:04.291
WHAT HAPPENS

10:04.333 --> 10:07.959
IF I CAN'T KEEP THE JOB?

10:08.000 --> 10:11.125
UM, WHAT--WHAT HAPPENS
IF I START TO SLIDE BACK?

10:11.166 --> 10:14.041
I DON'T WANT
TO LET HIM DOWN.

10:14.083 --> 10:17.125
(tapping)

10:24.834 --> 10:26.041
(knocks on doorjamb)

10:26.083 --> 10:27.959
HEY.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.917
SO HOW'S SHE DOING?

10:29.959 --> 10:31.959
SHE SEEMS TO BE RESPONDING WELL
TO THE MEDICATIONS,

10:32.000 --> 10:33.291
YOU KNOW,
THE DAILY ROUTINES.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.542
GOOD. I WANTED TO TAKE HER
TO THE PLANETARIUM TODAY.

10:35.583 --> 10:37.166
SHE'S SO EXCITED.
SAM--

10:37.208 --> 10:38.709
SHE'S SCARED,

10:38.750 --> 10:40.458
BUT I DON'T KNOW,
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

10:40.500 --> 10:42.250
I FEEL LIKE I CAN SEE THE LIGHT
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.

10:42.291 --> 10:44.875
THAT LIGHT COULD BE
AN ONCOMING TRAIN.

10:44.917 --> 10:48.041
WAIT, I THOUGHT--I THOUGHT
YOU SAID SHE WAS DOING BETTER.

10:48.083 --> 10:50.291
PEOPLE WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER,
THEY GO IN CYCLES.

10:50.333 --> 10:53.709
RIGHT? THERE ARE GOOD DAYS,
AND THERE ARE SETBACKS.

10:53.750 --> 10:55.750
SETBACKS, YEAH, I KNOW.
BELIEVE ME. I GET THAT.

10:55.792 --> 10:58.208
BUT I'M HERE FOR HER NOW.

10:58.250 --> 11:00.000
SO, YOU KNOW, WHAT--
WHATEVER'S AHEAD,

11:00.041 --> 11:01.333
I THINK I CAN HANDLE IT.

11:01.375 --> 11:03.709
THANK YOU.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.625
YEAH.

11:05.667 --> 11:07.041
(indistinct conversations)

11:07.083 --> 11:08.375
YOU LOOK NICE TODAY.

11:08.417 --> 11:10.041
REALLY? YOU THINK?

11:10.083 --> 11:11.917
OH, I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID IT
IF I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

11:11.959 --> 11:13.125
NO, I--NO, I KNOW,
BUT I MEAN, SOMETIMES,

11:13.166 --> 11:14.917
MEN JUST--
VIOLET, TAKE THE COMPLIMENT.

11:14.959 --> 11:16.125
OKAY. YOU'RE RIGHT.
(chuckles)

11:16.166 --> 11:18.625
(indistinct conversations
continue)

11:18.667 --> 11:19.834
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

11:19.875 --> 11:21.959
SURE.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
WHAT IS YOUR POSITION
ON CASUAL SEX?

11:26.875 --> 11:29.083
ARE YOU--ARE YOU
PROPOSITIONING ME?

11:29.125 --> 11:31.125
N-NO. (chuckles)
(chuckles)

11:31.166 --> 11:33.375
NO, I JUST--I WANTED
THE, UH, YOU KNOW,

11:33.417 --> 11:35.041
THE MALE PERSPECTIVE.

11:35.083 --> 11:36.375
WELL, LET'S SEE.
WHEN I WAS IN MY 20s,

11:36.417 --> 11:38.041
I WAS ALL FOR IT.

11:38.083 --> 11:39.375
YOU KNOW,
FOR MOST OF MY 30s,

11:39.417 --> 11:41.041
I WAS
IN A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP,

11:41.083 --> 11:42.375
AND WHEN I WASN'T,

11:42.417 --> 11:44.375
CASUAL SEX WAS SOMETHING
I COULD TAKE OR LEAVE.

11:44.417 --> 11:46.041
NOW THAT I'M IN MY 40s,

11:46.083 --> 11:48.667
IT IS NICE TO HAVE
SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.750
HUH.

11:51.792 --> 11:54.041
I WOULD'VE PEGGED YOU FOR...

11:54.083 --> 11:55.458
BEING MORE ADVENTUROUS.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.625
BASED ON?

11:57.667 --> 11:59.041
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SMART,
YOU'RE HANDSOME.

11:59.083 --> 12:01.041
I'M SURE YOU'RE NEVER
LACKING WITH THE LADIES.

12:01.083 --> 12:03.041
I'M AN OLD-FASHIONED GUY.
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?

12:03.083 --> 12:04.166
(laughs)

12:04.208 --> 12:06.041
YOU GOT THE WRONG IDEA
ABOUT ME, VIOLET.

12:06.083 --> 12:07.625
REALLY?

12:09.083 --> 12:11.709
FIJI.

12:11.750 --> 12:14.041
CAN ANYBODY IN THIS OFFICE
KEEP A SECRET?

12:14.083 --> 12:16.500
IT'S REALLY
NOT WHAT WE DO BEST.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.041
(footsteps approach)

12:24.083 --> 12:25.375
(knock on door)

12:25.417 --> 12:27.041
I BROUGHT YOU A BURRITO.

12:27.083 --> 12:29.041
SHELDON, I-I TOLD YOU,
I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING.

12:29.083 --> 12:30.583
AND, YOU KNOW...

12:30.625 --> 12:34.041
(sighs) WHEN YOU KNOCK, IT IS
POLITE TO WAIT FOR A REPLY.

12:34.083 --> 12:36.250
OH, WELL, SORRY.

12:42.083 --> 12:45.000
(people speaking indistinctly)

12:46.875 --> 12:49.041
I'M GONNA GET SOME COFFEE.

12:49.083 --> 12:50.291
OKAY.

12:50.333 --> 12:53.750
AND NEXT, I'M GOING TO...

12:53.792 --> 12:58.083
ADD A LITTLE HALF AND HALF
AND SOME SUGAR.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.417
WHY THE RUNNING COMMENTARY?

13:00.458 --> 13:03.500
WELL, I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU
GET ALL THE DETAILS STRAIGHT

13:03.542 --> 13:05.500
FOR WHEN YOU TELL VIOLET.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.667
LOOK, YOU KNOW... (sighs)

13:09.709 --> 13:11.583
PALM SPRINGS
WAS--WAS INTENSE,

13:11.625 --> 13:13.458
AND I--AND I NEEDED SOMEONE
TO PROCESS IT WITH, AND--

13:13.500 --> 13:16.041
YOU TOLD HER ABOUT
PALM SPRINGS? WOW. UH...

13:16.083 --> 13:18.000
SHE ONLY MENTIONED FIJI.

13:18.041 --> 13:19.542
CRAP.

13:19.583 --> 13:22.083
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU ARE
THE ONE WHO STARTED THIS.

13:22.125 --> 13:24.458
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE ALL,
"OH, DO YOU THINK THERE'S

13:24.500 --> 13:25.959
SOMETHING EMOTIONAL
BETWEEN US."

13:26.000 --> 13:27.083
I WASN'T EVEN THINKING
ABOUT IT.

13:27.125 --> 13:29.542
REALLY?

13:29.583 --> 13:31.959
OKAY, I WAS
THINKING ABOUT IT,

13:32.000 --> 13:34.166
ABOUT YOU,
BUT AT LEAST I CAME CLEAN.

13:34.208 --> 13:37.208
NOT LIKE YOU. YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
SAID WHY YOU WANTED TO KNOW.

13:39.083 --> 13:42.750
WHY--WHY DID YOU WANT
TO KNOW?

13:44.125 --> 13:46.000
TELL VIOLET,
IF SHE WANTS TO HEAR ABOUT

13:46.041 --> 13:47.709
WHAT YOU SAY IN YOUR SLEEP
WHEN YOU'RE DRUNK,

13:47.750 --> 13:49.166
I'LL BE IN MY OFFICE
ALL AFTERNOON.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.792
(sighs)

13:54.834 --> 13:57.917
WE APPRECIATE DR. MONTGOMERY
HAVING YOU TALK TO US,

13:57.959 --> 14:00.208
BUT DANI AND I
HAVE COME TO A DECISION.

14:00.250 --> 14:04.041
WE DON'T WANT
TO DO THE SURGERY.

14:04.083 --> 14:07.041
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
A VERY HARD THING TO COME TO.

14:07.083 --> 14:09.041
WELL, WE'RE HAVING A BABY,

14:09.083 --> 14:11.083
A BEAUTIFUL,
HEALTHY BABY GIRL.

14:11.125 --> 14:13.041
IT'S...

14:13.083 --> 14:15.917
IT'S A BLESSING.

14:15.959 --> 14:17.542
IT'S OKAY TO BE UPSET,
DANI.

14:17.583 --> 14:20.417
WHAT YOU AND LAUREL ARE DOING
IS VERY HARD.

14:20.458 --> 14:24.041
LOSING A CHILD AT ANY AGE
IS DEVASTATING, BUT...

14:24.083 --> 14:26.166
IT'S JUST, I DON'T THINK
THAT WE HAVE TO LOSE

14:26.208 --> 14:27.542
EITHER ONE OF THEM.

14:27.583 --> 14:30.125
BUT WE AGREED, THE SURGERY,
IT'S JUST TOO RISKY.

14:30.166 --> 14:31.458
DID YOU AGREE, DANI?

14:31.500 --> 14:34.041
N-NO. NO.

14:34.083 --> 14:36.834
YOU WERE JUST SO ADAMANT WHEN
WE SPOKE TO DR. MONTGOMERY...

14:38.083 --> 14:40.041
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK.

14:40.083 --> 14:41.875
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

14:41.917 --> 14:44.166
I THINK IF WE HAVE A CHANCE
TO HAVE BOTH OF OUR BABIES,

14:44.208 --> 14:46.000
THAT THAT'S
WHAT WE SHOULD DO.

14:46.041 --> 14:48.000
NO, ALL THE DOCTORS
WE'VE SEEN,

14:48.041 --> 14:50.208
ALL THE MONEY WE'VE SPENT,

14:50.250 --> 14:52.041
THE NIGHT I ALMOST DIED
IN THE E.R.--

14:52.083 --> 14:53.917
IT WAS ALL TO HAVE A BABY.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.208
NOW WE CAN HAVE ONE.

14:55.250 --> 14:57.083
BUT DR. MONTGOMERY SAID
WE CAN HAVE BOTH OF THEM.

14:57.125 --> 14:59.083
NO. NO. SHE SAID MAYBE.

14:59.125 --> 15:02.041
SHE SAID IT COMES WITH
VERY SERIOUS RISK.

15:02.083 --> 15:05.083
GOD, DANI, IT'S MY BODY.
IT'S MY DECISION.

15:05.125 --> 15:07.166
DID YOU REALLY
JUST SAY THAT?

15:07.208 --> 15:08.667
DANI, I--

15:08.709 --> 15:10.625
DANI--
DID YOU REALLY JUST PULL
THE "IT'S MY BODY" CARD?

15:10.667 --> 15:12.083
I DIDN'T--I...
(exhales)

15:12.125 --> 15:13.917
THOSE ARE MY EGGS IN THERE.
THOSE ARE MY BABIES.

15:13.959 --> 15:15.500
DANI, LAUREL--

15:15.542 --> 15:17.041
I-I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO
SAY GOOD-BYE TO ONE OF THEM.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.792
YOU THINK I WANT TO LOSE
ONE OF OUR KIDS?

15:18.834 --> 15:20.625
OH, NOW THEY'RE
OUR KIDS AGAIN.

15:20.667 --> 15:22.166
YOU THINK I WANT THIS?

15:22.208 --> 15:24.041
YOU THINK
THIS ISN'T KILLING ME?

15:24.083 --> 15:25.917
LOOK, I TOLD YOU
NOT TO NAME THEM.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.208
OH, MY GOD.

15:27.250 --> 15:28.667
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

15:28.709 --> 15:31.041
I CAN'T LOSE THEM BOTH, DANI.
I CAN'T.

15:31.083 --> 15:33.834
YOU ARE SO SCARED
OF EVERYTHING.

15:33.875 --> 15:36.208
SHE'S SCARED TO NAME A BABY.
YOU'RE SCARED TO HAVE SURGERY.

15:36.250 --> 15:37.458
YOU'RE SCARED
TO COME TO A HOSPITAL.

15:37.500 --> 15:38.959
I GET IT, LAUREL.

15:39.041 --> 15:41.125
AND IT IS YOUR BODY,
BUT IF YOU

15:41.166 --> 15:42.917
LET ONE OF OUR BABIES DIE

15:42.959 --> 15:46.750
WITHOUT DOING EVERYTHING
YOU CAN TO SAVE HIM,

15:46.792 --> 15:48.208
I WON'T ACCEPT THAT,

15:48.250 --> 15:50.625
I WON'T GET IT,

15:50.667 --> 15:53.208
AND I WILL NEVER
FORGIVE IT.

16:02.500 --> 16:03.709
YOU.

16:03.750 --> 16:04.959
YOU ARE DANGEROUS.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.041
YOU SAW JAKE?

16:06.083 --> 16:07.792
OKAY. I JUST--I NEEDED
A GUY'S OPINION

16:07.834 --> 16:09.041
ON THE WHOLE CASUAL SEX THING,

16:09.083 --> 16:11.917
AND HE WAS ACTING LIKE
HE WAS ABOVE IT ALL,

16:11.959 --> 16:13.125
WHICH I THOUGHT
WAS DISINGENUOUS,

16:13.166 --> 16:14.917
GIVEN THE FACT THAT WITHOUT
EVEN KNOWING YOUR NAME,

16:14.959 --> 16:16.667
HE INVITED YOU TO FIJI,
SO I JUST SAID THE WORD "FIJI."

16:16.709 --> 16:17.917
I'M SO SORRY.

16:17.959 --> 16:19.041
NOW HE'S TORTURING ME.

16:19.083 --> 16:20.041
BECAUSE OF ME?

16:20.083 --> 16:21.458
BECAUSE... (sighs)

16:21.500 --> 16:23.000
I DON'T KNOW. I THINK
HE ENJOYS IT. I DON'T KNOW.

16:23.041 --> 16:25.041
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S ALL
SO FRUSTRATING ANYWAY.

16:25.083 --> 16:27.041
UM... TELL ME ABOUT LAUREL.

16:27.083 --> 16:29.458
WELL, LAUREL DOESN'T WANT
THE SURGERY, AND DANI DOES.

16:29.500 --> 16:32.041
THEY'RE IN A... THEY'RE IN
A TOUGH SPOT.

16:32.083 --> 16:36.000
♪♪♪

16:37.083 --> 16:39.041
(door closes)

16:39.083 --> 16:41.208
HAVE YOU SEEN
MY "STAR WARS " DVDs?

16:41.250 --> 16:43.000
I'M SUPPOSED TO BRING 'EM
OVER TO MASON TONIGHT.

16:43.041 --> 16:44.792
WELL, I CAN FIND 'EM
AND DROP 'EM OFF

16:44.834 --> 16:47.041
IF YOU WANT
TO CRAWL INTO BED.

16:47.083 --> 16:49.000
NO. I'M FINE.

16:49.041 --> 16:50.083
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

16:50.125 --> 16:52.583

OH.
SHE STARTS TOMORROW.

17:08.625 --> 17:10.041
CHARLOTTE, NO.
IT'S DONE.

17:10.083 --> 17:11.375
YOU'RE GONNA GET SOME REST,

17:11.417 --> 17:13.041
AND ERICA AND MASON
WILL BE FINE.

17:13.083 --> 17:14.041
WHAT EXACTLY
IS A NIGHT NURSE GONNA DO

17:14.083 --> 17:15.583

GETS UP TO GO TO HIM,

IN THE HALLWAY?

I DIDN'T ASK FOR HELP

17:27.083 --> 17:28.458

25:47.291 --> 25:48.458
I WOULD BE ALL FOR IT.

25:48.500 --> 25:51.250
JUST--JUST--
JUST NOT TODAY.

25:53.083 --> 25:54.333
OKAY.

25:54.375 --> 25:57.208
SO I-I'M GONNA GO THEN.

25:57.250 --> 25:59.083
YEAH.

26:06.250 --> 26:08.208
(clicks lock)

26:08.250 --> 26:09.458
(elevator bell dings)

26:09.500 --> 26:11.667
(Violet speaking indistinctly)

26:11.709 --> 26:14.166
ADDISON, I WAS HOPING
I'D FIND YOU HERE.

26:14.208 --> 26:16.041
HI, CORINNE.
YEAH, NO, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT LAST NIGHT,

26:16.083 --> 26:17.166
WAKING YOU UP--
I FELT BAD.

26:17.208 --> 26:18.583
SO I BROUGHT YOU LUNCH.

26:18.625 --> 26:20.000
NO, YOU DIDN'T--YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

26:20.041 --> 26:21.041
NO, I KNOW. IT'S FRESH.

26:21.083 --> 26:22.291
I WENT TO THE MARKET
THIS MORNING

26:22.333 --> 26:24.041
AND--AND CHOPPED
THE VEGETABLES,

26:24.083 --> 26:25.250
AND I DIDN'T FORGET ABOUT YOU
EITHER, DR. TURNER. HERE YOU GO.

26:25.291 --> 26:27.041
OH, I'M FINE.
NO, YOU CAN EAT IT LATER.

26:27.083 --> 26:28.083
I'M GONNA GO GET SHELDON.
OKAY.

26:28.125 --> 26:29.375
HEY.
HEY, CORINNE.

26:29.417 --> 26:31.166
ARE YOU HUNGRY?
UH...

26:31.208 --> 26:33.208
'CAUSE I GOT--
I GOT SANDWICHES, TOO.
(elevator bell dings)

26:33.250 --> 26:34.709
OH.

26:34.750 --> 26:36.125
THANK YOU. OH.
(laughs)

26:36.166 --> 26:38.083
UH, CORINNE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

26:38.125 --> 26:39.750
I-I MADE LUNCH
FOR YOUR FRIENDS.

26:39.792 --> 26:42.041
I CAME DOWN AFTER MY SHOWER,
YOU WERE GONE. I WAS WORRIED.

26:42.083 --> 26:43.125
SAM, IT'S OKAY.

26:43.166 --> 26:44.417
NO, ACTUALLY,
IT'S NOT OKAY.

26:44.458 --> 26:46.083
SAM, YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.

26:46.125 --> 26:48.041
NO, YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB
OF THAT ALL BY YOURSELF.

26:48.083 --> 26:49.041
CORINNE,
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

26:49.083 --> 26:51.041
WHY DOES EVERYONE
KEEP ASKING ME THAT?

26:51.083 --> 26:53.625
I BROUGHT IN SOME--SOME SALAD
AND SOME SANDWICHES.

26:53.667 --> 26:54.875
YOU--YOU WANT ONE?

26:54.917 --> 26:56.125
LET'S JUST GO HOME.

26:56.166 --> 26:58.041
MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK FIRST.
NO, NOTHING IS WRONG.

26:58.083 --> 27:00.834
I CAME HERE TO APOLOGIZE
TO ADDISON

27:00.875 --> 27:02.041
FOR WAKING HER UP.

27:02.083 --> 27:03.250
EVERYTHING WAS FINE.

27:03.291 --> 27:05.041
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE HERE.

27:05.083 --> 27:07.709
YOU DIDN'T NEED TO COME!
EVERYTHING WAS JUST FINE!

27:07.750 --> 27:08.959
CORINNE.

27:11.750 --> 27:13.041
IT'S FINE.

27:13.083 --> 27:15.041
EXCUSE ME.
EVERYTHING IS FINE.

27:28.417 --> 27:30.166
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CALLING.
CAN I SEE HER?

27:30.208 --> 27:31.667
I'M SORRY.
SHE'S ALREADY IN THE O.R.

27:31.709 --> 27:33.041
NO.

27:33.083 --> 27:34.583
SHE NEEDS TO KNOW I'M HERE.

27:34.625 --> 27:36.375
I'M SORRY. I-I CAN'T
LET YOU IN THERE.

27:36.417 --> 27:37.917
PLEASE. LOOK, I WAS AN ASS.

27:37.959 --> 27:39.709
I WAS AWFUL.
I JUST GOT SO MAD. I...

27:39.750 --> 27:41.333
OH, IT'S JUST WHAT I DO.

27:41.375 --> 27:43.333
WHEN I GET SCARED, I GET MAD,
BUT WHEN SHE GETS SCARED,

27:43.375 --> 27:45.750
SHE JUST--
SHE JUST GETS SCARED.

27:45.792 --> 27:47.750
SHE CAN'T BE IN THERE
BY HERSELF.

27:47.792 --> 27:50.208
SHE NEEDS TO KNOW THAT...

27:50.250 --> 27:52.709
SHE NEEDS TO KNOW
THAT I LOVE HER.

27:52.750 --> 27:54.709
SHE DOES KNOW THAT YOU LOVE HER.
THAT'S WHY SHE'S IN THERE.

27:54.750 --> 27:57.834
NO, BUT SHE NEEDS TO KNOW
THAT I'M HERE.

27:57.875 --> 27:59.000
PLEASE.

A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

32:41.083 --> 32:43.959
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF HER.
GO AHEAD.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.875
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK,
CORINNE.

32:45.917 --> 32:49.041
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

32:49.083 --> 32:52.542
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

32:53.583 --> 32:55.917
(Dani) HEY.
(Laurel) WHAT HAPPENED?

32:55.959 --> 32:57.500
DID IT WORK?
ARE THE BABIES OKAY?

32:57.542 --> 32:59.500
THEY'RE BOTH
GONNA BE JUST FINE.

32:59.542 --> 33:02.083
OH. (exhales deeply)

33:02.125 --> 33:03.750
YOU ARE A STUBBORN BITCH.

33:03.792 --> 33:05.709
(laughs and sniffles)
I KNOW.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.125
I'M SO SORRY.

33:07.166 --> 33:10.041
I'M SO SORRY
I LEFT YOU.

33:10.083 --> 33:11.542
(people speaking indistinctly)

33:11.583 --> 33:13.667
(Addison) HEY.
HI.

33:13.709 --> 33:14.959
THE SURGERY WAS A SUCCESS.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.500
WE WERE ABLE TO INSERT
THE BALLOON

33:16.542 --> 33:17.709
INTO YOUR BOY'S TRACHEA.

33:17.750 --> 33:19.542
AND HIS LUNGS WILL DEVELOP
NORMALLY.

33:19.583 --> 33:21.750
WE'LL REMOVE IT A COUPLE
OF WEEKS BEFORE LABOR.

33:21.792 --> 33:23.834
THANK YOU,
BOTH OF YOU.

33:23.875 --> 33:27.041
DURING THE SURGERY,
WE DISCOVERED AN AMNIOTIC BAND

33:27.083 --> 33:29.500
AROUND YOUR DAUGHTER.
OH, NO.

33:29.542 --> 33:32.625
IT'S OKAY. WE FIXED IT, AND BOTH
BABIES ARE GONNA BE JUST FINE.

33:32.667 --> 33:35.125
BUT IF DR. MONTGOMERY
HADN'T GONE IN THERE

33:35.166 --> 33:36.583
TO FIX THE HERNIA...

33:36.625 --> 33:38.208
WE COULD'VE LOST
BOTH OF THEM?

33:38.250 --> 33:41.583
(beeping continues)

33:43.375 --> 33:46.208
I'M GLAD
YOU'RE A STUBBORN BITCH.

33:54.834 --> 33:56.458

33:56.500 --> 33:59.166
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

34:04.250 --> 34:07.458
SO... UM...

34:07.500 --> 34:10.000
SO WE CAN'T GO BACK TO
THE WAY THINGS WERE, RIGHT?

34:10.041 --> 34:11.542
I MEAN, THAT OBVIOUSLY
WASN'T WORKING

34:11.583 --> 34:13.750
AND, UM,
WE CLEARLY HAVE ISSUES

34:13.792 --> 34:15.250
OF FORGIVENESS AND TRUST.

34:15.291 --> 34:18.375
BUT I THINK WE COULD
WORK THROUGH THEM

34:18.417 --> 34:20.000
WITH THERAPY.

34:20.041 --> 34:22.250
YOU ANALYZING ME IS ONE OF
THE PROBLEMS IN OUR MARRIAGE.

34:22.291 --> 34:24.709
I AM CLEAR ON THAT. THAT'S WHY
IT WOULD BE SOMEBODY ELSE.

34:24.750 --> 34:27.041
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD QUIT
WITHOUT KNOWING,

34:27.083 --> 34:30.709
AND IF WE'RE GONNA QUIT,
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE DOUBTS, AND...

34:30.750 --> 34:32.500
I HAVE DOUBTS.

34:33.750 --> 34:35.709
DO YOU? (chuckles)

34:36.834 --> 34:38.792
(sighs)

34:38.834 --> 34:40.417
OKAY.

34:40.458 --> 34:41.792
SO--

34:41.834 --> 34:43.458
I'M NOT SAYING THAT I WANT
TO GO THERAPY.

34:43.500 --> 34:45.041
I-I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO GIVE ME AN ANSWER TODAY.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.041
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THAT IF--IF, UH,

34:47.083 --> 34:49.166
YOU KNOW, TOMORROW
OR--OR NEXT WEEK

34:49.208 --> 34:50.667
OR NEXT MONTH

34:50.709 --> 34:53.041
YOU WANT TO PUT OUR FAMILY
BACK TOGETHER

34:53.083 --> 34:55.667
AND YOU'RE WILLING
TO DO THERAPY, THEN I'M...

34:55.709 --> 34:58.000
I'M WILLING, TOO.

35:05.667 --> 35:07.583
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE
WITH ERICA AND MASON.

35:07.625 --> 35:10.834
SO DID I.

35:10.875 --> 35:12.875
YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE YOU FEEL GUILTY.

35:12.917 --> 35:15.041
I AM.

35:15.083 --> 35:18.041
I DO FEEL GUILTY.

35:18.083 --> 35:20.667

I MEAN, YOU'RE AMAZING.

35:20.709 --> 35:23.834

35:23.875 --> 35:25.041
I MEAN, YOU--

35:25.083 --> 35:26.875

THAN I AM.

35:26.917 --> 35:28.166
YOU ARE...

35:28.208 --> 35:30.125
I MEAN, THE ONLY REASON
I'VE BEEN GETTING THROUGH THIS

35:30.166 --> 35:32.583
IS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT
WHATEVER HAPPENS, I HAVE YOU.

35:32.625 --> 35:34.583
AND I'VE BEEN TAKING THAT
FOR GRANTED

35:34.625 --> 35:37.959
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN YOU,
I BELIEVE IN US,

35:38.000 --> 35:40.875
SO MUCH THAT I HAVE NOT
STOPPED TO THINK ABOUT

35:40.917 --> 35:42.458
WHAT IT'S BEEN DOING
TO OUR MARRIAGE.

35:42.500 --> 35:45.709
AND THAT IS A MISTAKE.

35:45.750 --> 35:47.041
I WANT YOU TO BE SURE.

35:47.083 --> 35:48.792
I WANT YOU TO KNOW...

35:50.125 --> 35:52.291
YOU ARE EVERYTHING TO ME.

35:52.333 --> 35:55.333
YOU ARE EVERYTHING I WANT.
YOU ARE EVERYTHING I NEED.

35:55.375 --> 35:58.166
I SPENT ALL DAY
THINKING ABOUT

35:58.208 --> 36:00.834
WHAT I COULD BUY YOU
OR PLAY FOR YOU

36:00.875 --> 36:02.333
OR COOK FOR YOU...

36:02.375 --> 36:04.375
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO COOK FOR ME.

36:04.417 --> 36:07.417
I DON'T WANT TO COOK
FOR YOU.

36:16.083 --> 36:17.875

36:50.834 --> 36:52.333

36:52.375 --> 36:54.917

36:57.667 --> 37:00.208

37:00.250 --> 37:02.291

37:03.875 --> 37:06.125

37:06.166 --> 37:07.792
IF YOU DECIDE

37:07.834 --> 37:09.875
I'LL BE HERE FOR YOU,

37:09.917 --> 37:11.834
