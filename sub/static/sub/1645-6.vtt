00:00.826 --> 00:02.611
Previously on Prison Break:

00:02.654 --> 00:04.352
Did you ask for
a recent photo

00:04.395 --> 00:06.528
of LJ and Sara?
Yeah.

00:06.571 --> 00:07.790
Where is it?She showed me the pictures,

00:07.833 --> 00:10.271
but she wouldn't
let me keep them.

00:10.314 --> 00:11.707
All right.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.535
I want to know
who this guy is.

00:13.578 --> 00:15.667
Said his name
was Sullins.

00:15.711 --> 00:18.018
Alex, thanks for coming in.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.758
Hello, Lang.

00:19.802 --> 00:21.499
What's going on?
I mean, there's all kinds

00:21.543 --> 00:23.501
of suits over here
going through your office.

00:23.545 --> 00:24.633
I know you, huh?

00:24.676 --> 00:25.503
Afraid not.

00:25.547 --> 00:27.201
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27.244 --> 00:28.332
You're McFadden.

00:28.376 --> 00:29.638
You've confused me
with someone else.

00:29.681 --> 00:31.727
You were with
the ambassador.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.859
You don't know me,
I don't know you,

00:33.903 --> 00:35.078
but it's your job to
get me out of here.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.645
You break out tomorrow.By 3:00 p.m.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.386
You mean a.m.
No, I mean p.m.

00:38.429 --> 00:41.084
We're doing this tomorrow...
in the middle of the day.

00:49.571 --> 00:51.573
Give me the ring.

00:51.616 --> 00:53.836
Wise decision.

00:57.535 --> 00:58.710
Want the ring,
brother?

00:58.754 --> 01:00.930
That's more
your style, man.

01:09.765 --> 01:10.635
Hey, hey, hey.

01:10.679 --> 01:13.290
It's all right, it's all right.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.208
You all go on back.
Go ahead.

01:18.252 --> 01:19.775
No, go ahead.

01:21.733 --> 01:23.257
A word.

01:28.305 --> 01:30.699
You should try and be more
careful in the future.

01:30.742 --> 01:31.743
Yes, sir.

01:31.787 --> 01:33.832
[ball thuds]

01:52.329 --> 01:53.330
Hey!

01:54.288 --> 01:55.724
Hey.

01:55.767 --> 01:58.379
What's your name?

01:58.422 --> 01:59.554
Tyge.

01:59.597 --> 02:01.556
Michael.

02:01.599 --> 02:02.818
The Australian.

02:02.861 --> 02:04.428
You said you
knew him from Nice.

02:04.472 --> 02:05.560
Is that true?

02:05.603 --> 02:07.475
You calling me a liar now?

02:07.518 --> 02:08.650
He says you're full of it.

02:08.693 --> 02:11.435
He said he was never
an ambassador.

02:11.479 --> 02:13.437
Not an ambassador.

02:13.481 --> 02:15.047
The ambassador.

02:15.091 --> 02:18.181
I was concierge at
the Ambassador Hotel.

02:18.225 --> 02:21.402
I could've sworn he worked
there for a few months.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.578
[chuckles]

02:23.621 --> 02:24.840
Who the hell knows, huh?

02:24.883 --> 02:26.668
I was high
half the time.

02:26.711 --> 02:28.844
Kind of why I got fired.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.498
Kind of why I'm in here.

02:30.541 --> 02:32.326
What was he up to in Nice?

02:32.369 --> 02:33.588
What?

02:33.631 --> 02:35.198
You writing a book?

02:35.242 --> 02:38.245
We're leaving at 3:13--
that gives us three hours,

02:38.288 --> 02:40.508
41 minutes.And we still don't have
a way into no-man's-land.

02:40.551 --> 02:41.987
I'll take care of that.

02:42.031 --> 02:43.511
I just need to
check it out first.And the fence?

02:43.554 --> 02:44.816
Your grave digger friends
only sprayed the thing once,

02:44.860 --> 02:46.601
And I'd just as soon not
get electrocuted today.

02:46.644 --> 02:48.733
Would I feel better
if Sucre had sprayed
the fence again? Yes.

02:48.777 --> 02:50.822
Is that an option? No.

02:50.866 --> 02:52.824
Unless he had another
reason to be there.

02:52.868 --> 02:54.130
What are you
going to do?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.914
Kill someone to get more spray
on the fence?

02:55.958 --> 02:58.265
I'd think about killing
you if it helped us get
out of here today.

02:58.308 --> 03:00.658
You know what'll help
us get out of here?

03:00.702 --> 03:01.790
A ladder.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.226
Michael...

03:03.270 --> 03:05.924
where are we gonna go once
we get through that fence?

03:07.491 --> 03:08.275
Just get me a ladder.

03:13.018 --> 03:14.803
This hammock's shorter
than the last one.

03:14.846 --> 03:16.761
Well, we might need something
to extend it.

03:16.805 --> 03:18.807
All right, I'll
take care of it.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.896
I've never been
to Nice.

03:20.939 --> 03:22.680
I hear it's beautiful.

03:22.724 --> 03:23.942
I wouldn't know.

03:23.986 --> 03:25.857
I don't care if this guy
knows you or not.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.337
But what I do
care about is

03:27.381 --> 03:29.818
his apparent fixation
with watching you at all times.

03:29.861 --> 03:31.863
[over PA]:
Scofield. Visita.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.909
We'll be out of
here soon enough.

03:33.952 --> 03:35.127
He won't be a problem.

03:35.171 --> 03:38.174
[OVER PA]:
Scofield, you have a visitor.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.132
[sighs]

03:41.743 --> 03:44.006
[corn sizzling]

03:44.049 --> 03:45.790
Hey, buddy,
check it out.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.836
Do they roll bones
in your country?

03:47.879 --> 03:49.316
Come to my cell,
I'll teach you.

03:49.359 --> 03:52.623
You want me to come back
to your cell and "roll bones"?

03:52.667 --> 03:53.842
[laughter]

03:53.885 --> 03:55.322
Real subtle.

03:55.365 --> 03:56.758
Hardy har-har.

03:56.801 --> 03:58.368
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's hilarious.

03:58.412 --> 03:59.935
Tell me,

03:59.978 --> 04:01.763
are you this friendly with
all the shirtless guys in Sona?

04:01.806 --> 04:03.155
I gave you food yesterday.

04:03.199 --> 04:05.375
I gave you a
place to sleep.

04:05.419 --> 04:06.333
I wonder why.

04:06.376 --> 04:08.073
What the hell
is your problem?

04:08.117 --> 04:10.685
Look, I just don't want
to have sex with you, okay?

04:10.728 --> 04:12.904
[laughter]

04:12.948 --> 04:14.950
Is that so hard
to believe?

04:24.612 --> 04:26.483
MAN:
Get a plate.

04:27.789 --> 04:29.312
To make it across no-man's-land,

04:29.356 --> 04:32.315
we're going to have to disable
two of the tower guards.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.274
I've already taken care
of one of them.

04:34.317 --> 04:36.928
With the other one,
we're going to need your help.

04:36.972 --> 04:38.626
Every day between
1:00 and 2:00,

04:38.669 --> 04:39.540
he takes his lunch break.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.106
He gets a cup of coffee.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.326
You need to find out where
and put something in that cup.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.502
Make sure he's unconscious
during the escape.

04:45.546 --> 04:48.244
You're dropping this on me
with three hours to go?

04:48.288 --> 04:50.638
I don't know
what to tell you.
3:13?

04:50.681 --> 04:51.900
3:13 is when it starts.

04:51.943 --> 04:54.424
We'll be on the beach by 3:25.

04:54.468 --> 04:55.730
In broad daylight.

04:55.773 --> 04:57.601
The Company still thinks
we're doing this at 9:00

04:57.645 --> 04:59.081
tonight, right?

04:59.124 --> 05:00.387
Listen, I can't lie to
these people anymore, Michael.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.214
We need time
to survey the transfer site,

05:02.258 --> 05:04.826
to figure out if we can get LJ
and Sara out of there

05:04.869 --> 05:06.393
in case
they try something.

05:06.436 --> 05:08.699
You got the gun?
Yeah, I got
the gun.

05:08.743 --> 05:11.485
[sighs]

05:11.528 --> 05:12.964
How's LJ? How's Sara?

05:13.008 --> 05:14.575
They're fine.

05:14.618 --> 05:16.620
What about the pictures?

05:16.664 --> 05:17.882
I can't get pictures.

05:17.926 --> 05:19.101
I need them, Linc.

05:19.144 --> 05:21.016
I can't get the pictures.

05:21.059 --> 05:22.147
How do we know
they're still alive?

05:22.191 --> 05:22.887
They're the only reason
I'm doing this.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.411
Susan says they're fine.

05:24.454 --> 05:26.630
Just trust her.
You're the one
who's always telling me

05:26.674 --> 05:27.936
we can't trust anybody.

05:27.979 --> 05:30.025
Now you're... you're vouching
for this person?

05:30.068 --> 05:32.244
There isn't enough time.

05:33.420 --> 05:37.728
Listen, if I don't see pictures
of LJ and Sara by 2:30

05:37.772 --> 05:39.774
this afternoon,

05:39.817 --> 05:42.080
I'm not going anywhere.

06:31.173 --> 06:34.045
Can't seem to find
American cheese down here.

06:34.089 --> 06:36.004
I hope you like Asadero.

06:36.047 --> 06:38.180
Yeah. This is perfect.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.314
A couple of years ago,
I was serving in Mosul.

06:43.881 --> 06:45.840
And I was taken
prisoner.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.232
A few nights later,

06:47.276 --> 06:51.106
I could hear the sound
of U.S. Army helicopters.

06:51.149 --> 06:52.847
Two clicks and closing.

06:52.890 --> 06:54.283
[helicopter propellers whirring]

06:54.326 --> 06:56.720
My hands were still tied
behind my back,

06:56.764 --> 06:58.026
and I... I ran.

06:58.069 --> 06:59.984
It didn't occur to me

07:00.028 --> 07:01.986
that if this was
a rescue mission,

07:02.030 --> 07:05.729
my captors could hear
the choppers.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.078
It didn't occur to me

07:07.122 --> 07:09.646
that this was actually
a hostage exchange,

07:09.690 --> 07:13.084
and that

07:13.128 --> 07:14.956
my jumping would be viewed

07:14.999 --> 07:18.307
as a hostile act.

07:19.961 --> 07:22.529
I got recaptured immediately.

07:22.572 --> 07:25.836
Six Rangers died

07:25.880 --> 07:27.664
in the firefight.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.100
[gunshot]

07:29.144 --> 07:30.885
And for the next three weeks...

07:30.928 --> 07:34.105
[gunshots]

07:37.065 --> 07:39.937
Let's just say

07:39.981 --> 07:42.462
men are pigs.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.468
Let's be clear.

07:49.817 --> 07:51.993
This is an exchange.

07:52.036 --> 07:54.082
If you don't try to be a hero,

07:54.125 --> 07:56.867
you and your father
will be okay.

07:56.911 --> 07:58.826
Okay?
Okay.

07:58.869 --> 08:01.045
Good.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.485
Eat.

08:09.706 --> 08:11.099
Norman? Norman?!

08:11.142 --> 08:13.101
As you can imagine,

08:13.144 --> 08:14.581
he prefers Lechero.

08:14.624 --> 08:15.973
Norman?

08:16.017 --> 08:18.454
He kill you before or
after he does your taxes.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.977
[laughter]

08:20.021 --> 08:21.501
Kill you when he pleases.

08:22.719 --> 08:23.981
I'm feeling thirsty.

08:24.025 --> 08:26.157
Why don't you go fix us
something to drink, boy?

08:26.201 --> 08:28.116
Maybe you ain't
got the memorandum,

08:28.159 --> 08:29.944
but I've been promoted.

08:29.987 --> 08:32.294
Boy.

08:33.121 --> 08:35.906
What did you say to me?

08:35.950 --> 08:37.168
Hmm?

08:37.212 --> 08:38.082
What's the problem?

08:38.126 --> 08:39.214
Stumpy here and his mouth.

08:39.257 --> 08:40.911
That's the problem.

08:40.955 --> 08:43.000
I'm calling him
out right now!

08:43.044 --> 08:45.568
I'll talk to him. Leave.

08:47.091 --> 08:49.572
This isn't over.

08:51.095 --> 08:55.317
LECHERO:
Leave!

08:56.884 --> 08:58.146
We were just, uh...

08:58.189 --> 08:59.103
No, no, no.

08:59.147 --> 09:00.888
The favor you owe me...

09:00.931 --> 09:02.150
What have you found out?

09:02.193 --> 09:04.456
A thing like this takes time.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.242
I can't just walk up to them
and say, "Hey, whoever's been

09:07.285 --> 09:09.200
betraying Lechero,
raise your hand." You know?

09:09.244 --> 09:11.899
I asked you to be my ears
in this prison,

09:11.942 --> 09:13.335
and you hear nothing?!

09:13.378 --> 09:15.555
All I know is every time
I try and sit down and begin

09:15.598 --> 09:18.122
sussing things out, Sammy always
changes the subject.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.255
Not that I'm saying
he's the guy, but...

09:20.298 --> 09:23.127
I don't want
to hear your theories.

09:23.171 --> 09:25.608
I want results.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.274
[sighs]

09:44.105 --> 09:45.149
Is everything okay?

09:45.193 --> 09:47.151
Is James
all right?
Yeah, he's fine.

09:47.195 --> 09:50.198
Where is this from?

09:50.241 --> 09:52.113
Uribe's, the roadside

09:52.156 --> 09:53.505
bodega a few kilometers away.

09:53.549 --> 09:55.377
If I needed you
to ID a specific guard--

09:55.420 --> 09:57.161
a tower guard--
could you do it?

09:57.205 --> 09:59.337
I just don't want
to get busted.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.078
Could you do it or not?

10:01.122 --> 10:02.732
Yes.

10:02.776 --> 10:06.257
[phone dialing]

10:06.301 --> 10:08.172
Lincoln?Yeah.

10:08.216 --> 10:10.348
What is it?I need something.

10:36.374 --> 10:38.159
CHEO:
Teodoro's
harmless, man.

10:38.202 --> 10:40.422
He's a...
he's a clown.He's a dead clown.

10:45.296 --> 10:48.299
Hey, man, I wasn't going
to say anything,

10:48.343 --> 10:50.824
but, uh, last night,

10:50.867 --> 10:54.566
I was looking for my playing
cards and guess what?

10:55.872 --> 10:57.178
I found these.

10:57.221 --> 10:59.093
You're holding out on me.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.268
[laughing]:
Take 'em.

11:00.311 --> 11:01.791
They taste nasty.

11:01.835 --> 11:05.186
CHEO:
Man, you cannot get a
better cigar than this.

11:05.229 --> 11:06.535
Where'd you get these? Augusto?

11:06.578 --> 11:08.755
I can't make him stop
sending them in to me,

11:08.798 --> 11:10.713
but I don't work for him,
you understand?

11:12.193 --> 11:14.195
CHEO:
You sure you
don't mind?

11:48.359 --> 11:50.753
I was in the neighborhood.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.324
You came all this way to visit?

11:56.367 --> 11:58.718
I came to get you out of here.

11:58.761 --> 12:01.198
I can have you in Schaum
Correctional Facility

12:01.242 --> 12:02.809
in 48 hours.

12:02.852 --> 12:04.375
In St. Louis.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.334
Sullins wanted
a medium security,

12:06.377 --> 12:08.553
but, uh, talked him down.

12:08.597 --> 12:10.686
What sort of deal
is he getting me?

12:10.730 --> 12:11.992
25 years?

12:12.035 --> 12:13.254
Life?

12:13.297 --> 12:14.995
The director's giving
us a lot of latitude

12:15.038 --> 12:16.692
in exchange for testimony
against the government

12:16.736 --> 12:19.173
in the Lincoln Burrows
conspiracy.

12:19.216 --> 12:21.305
So...

12:21.349 --> 12:23.264
how does eight years sound?

12:23.307 --> 12:26.267
Soon as Sullins
finishes up,

12:26.310 --> 12:28.225
we can have
a van ready...

12:28.269 --> 12:30.619
I don't think so.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.403
What?

12:32.447 --> 12:33.927
I appreciate the effort,

12:33.970 --> 12:38.235
your effort, but, um,
I can't do eight years.

12:38.279 --> 12:39.933
You're doing ten now.

12:39.976 --> 12:43.414
The government is
calling in some favors.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.808
Once you're in the U.S.,
if you don't cooperate,

12:45.852 --> 12:47.244
they're going to charge you
with everything.

12:47.288 --> 12:49.333
That's multiple homicide counts.

12:53.468 --> 12:54.991
Without this deal,

12:55.035 --> 12:57.777
you are gonna be in prison
for the rest of your life.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.824
I appreciate the effort--

13:01.868 --> 13:03.478
your effort--

13:03.521 --> 13:06.350
Alex...
but I can't.

13:06.394 --> 13:07.699
Alex!

13:11.442 --> 13:13.444
While we're getting
out of here, and...

13:13.488 --> 13:16.273
if I don't make it,

13:16.317 --> 13:19.363
can you make sure this
gets to my girlfriend?

13:21.191 --> 13:22.976
All right.

13:25.979 --> 13:29.504
You know, uh... I could
do the same for you.

13:29.547 --> 13:32.115
Tie an anchor bend there.

13:32.159 --> 13:33.987
I was just offering.

13:34.030 --> 13:36.424
You know what, if I'm the one
who doesn't make it,

13:36.467 --> 13:37.599
and you really want
to do me a favor,

13:37.642 --> 13:39.383
just hold up your end
of the bargain.

13:39.427 --> 13:42.299
I'll do everything I can.

13:42.343 --> 13:44.040
I hope that's true.

13:44.084 --> 13:47.435
How's that knot coming?

13:47.478 --> 13:49.437
There.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.482
Did I pass your test?

13:51.526 --> 13:54.311
I told you I'm a fisherman.

13:54.355 --> 13:56.792
Where are we?

13:56.836 --> 13:59.012
I found a cell that'll get us
into no-man's-land.

13:59.055 --> 14:01.449
It's a longer run to the fence
than my old one,

14:01.492 --> 14:02.450
but it's gonna have to do.

14:02.493 --> 14:04.365
Which one? Who lives there?

14:04.408 --> 14:06.541
Papo, Cheo and Sammy.

14:06.584 --> 14:08.804
Look, I know
what you're thinking,

14:08.848 --> 14:10.719
but it's the only
other cell on the second floor

14:10.762 --> 14:12.895
with a direct line to the fence,
where we won't be seen

14:12.939 --> 14:14.854
the other tower guards.And how do we

14:14.897 --> 14:16.116
guarantee that they
won't be there?

14:16.159 --> 14:18.509
By 2:00, everyone should
be out in the courtyard

14:18.553 --> 14:20.250
for the lunchtime soccer game.

14:20.294 --> 14:21.556
[men shouting]

14:21.599 --> 14:23.775
You sure it hasn't
started already?

14:31.131 --> 14:34.743
Someone went outside
the ring to settle a dispute.

14:34.786 --> 14:38.790
Now, anyone who affronts
our justice system

14:38.834 --> 14:41.576
in this way must be punished.

14:41.619 --> 14:44.231
Now, I know the coward
won't come forward.

14:44.274 --> 14:48.496
But if anyone has information
about this shameful act,

14:48.539 --> 14:50.890
I demand to know.

14:58.549 --> 15:01.552
Let's go, Menudo.Why?

15:01.596 --> 15:04.555
Lechero wants you.
Move your ass.

15:04.599 --> 15:05.861
[Lechero chuckles]

15:05.905 --> 15:08.385
Now, every day I see you
out in the yard,

15:08.429 --> 15:09.517
you play your American sports

15:09.560 --> 15:10.518
and wear
your American clothes.

15:10.561 --> 15:11.954
I don't think
I've heard you

15:11.998 --> 15:14.348
speak one word of Spanish
since you've been here.

15:14.391 --> 15:15.436
I like to practice my English.

15:15.479 --> 15:16.437
[chuckling]:
And why shouldn't you?

15:16.480 --> 15:18.961
America is a great nation.

15:19.005 --> 15:22.530
"One nation, indivisible, with
liberty and justice for all."

15:22.573 --> 15:24.097
Is that right?

15:24.140 --> 15:25.402
Yes.

15:25.446 --> 15:26.577
Yes.

15:26.621 --> 15:28.971
Justice for all.

15:29.015 --> 15:32.322
Justice for you
and justice for me.

15:32.366 --> 15:35.195
And justice for...

15:35.238 --> 15:37.806
whoever killed that
blanquito in the yard.

15:37.849 --> 15:41.941
Now, I know why you didn't
say anything out there.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.639
But you play your silly American
games all day long,

15:44.682 --> 15:47.598
right in front of the stairs
where the body was found.

15:49.557 --> 15:52.429
Now, if you don't tell me
what you saw,

15:52.473 --> 15:55.606
there will be consequences.

16:00.176 --> 16:04.528
Well, I-I saw one person
go into the stairwell.

16:06.748 --> 16:10.621
A-And then maybe a minute later,
I heard an argument.

16:10.665 --> 16:12.884
Who did you see?

16:16.497 --> 16:19.065
So after we tie the cord off...

16:19.108 --> 16:21.023
we dig out the bar,
we pop open the grate,

16:21.067 --> 16:22.590
and we're, and we're down,
right, Michael?

16:22.633 --> 16:23.808
Does anyone want
to say anything

16:23.852 --> 16:25.506
about what we just
saw out there?

16:25.549 --> 16:28.552
What is there to say?

16:28.596 --> 16:29.640
Well, for starters,
an hour ago,

16:29.684 --> 16:30.511
you say maybe we
should kill someone

16:30.554 --> 16:31.686
and then someone
gets killed.

16:31.729 --> 16:33.122
I didn't say that,
and this is exactly

16:33.166 --> 16:34.906
what we should be
focusing on right now.

16:34.950 --> 16:36.125
Let's spend a couple
of hours worrying

16:36.169 --> 16:38.519
about another dead body
in this hellhole.

16:38.562 --> 16:40.521
What do you want?

16:40.564 --> 16:41.652
WHISTLER:
What are you doing?

16:41.696 --> 16:42.610
Lechero wants to see you.

16:42.653 --> 16:44.351
I don't have any information.

16:44.394 --> 16:45.656
He doesn't want information.

16:45.700 --> 16:46.918
He wants a confession.

16:56.580 --> 16:57.538
I didn't do anything.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.627
Listen to him; he's innocent.

16:59.670 --> 17:01.498
You want
to confess?

17:01.542 --> 17:03.587
You can easily switch places.

17:03.631 --> 17:06.329
[breathing heavily]

17:07.591 --> 17:08.723
Maybe now
we should start worrying

17:08.766 --> 17:11.247
about who the real
killer is, huh?

17:11.291 --> 17:12.640
Yeah, but in this place,

17:12.683 --> 17:14.685
there could be
a hundred people on that list.

17:14.729 --> 17:16.252
Except I'm thinking
a single stab wound

17:16.296 --> 17:18.602
to the base of the neck looks
pretty professional, Alex.

17:18.646 --> 17:20.126
I was in visitation, Kojak.

17:20.169 --> 17:22.084
And what makes you so sure
that Whistler didn't do it?

17:22.128 --> 17:24.043
He's the one that had
the run-in with the guy.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.870
No, he's got too much to lose.Well,

17:25.914 --> 17:27.220
Whistler's gone,
and if not now,

17:27.263 --> 17:29.222
he probably will be soon,
so it's you and me.

17:29.265 --> 17:30.353
There's no you and me.

17:30.397 --> 17:32.007
We're not leaving
here without him.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.531
In two hours, I'm going out that
window and through that fence.

17:34.575 --> 17:35.750
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, that's right.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.447
And where are you
going to go to, Alex?

17:37.491 --> 17:38.579
Anywhere but here.

17:38.622 --> 17:40.276
There's only one road out,

17:40.320 --> 17:42.104
and the jungle is under
constant patrol by police 24-7,

17:42.148 --> 17:44.454
so, again, where are you going
to go to, Alex?

17:44.498 --> 17:47.283
3:13, I'm gone.

17:51.766 --> 17:54.725
I told you
I know nothing about this.

17:54.769 --> 17:55.813
I shouldn't...

17:55.857 --> 17:57.119
I shouldn't
be here.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.904
I can promise you I, I
did not kill that man.

17:59.948 --> 18:01.993
Someone saw you go
down the staircase.

18:02.037 --> 18:04.605
Stair... is there
any other proof?

18:04.648 --> 18:05.780
My men will find something.

18:05.823 --> 18:07.608
Well, do you see
a weapon on me?

18:07.651 --> 18:09.914
I didn't expect
to see a weapon on you.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.177
WHISTLER:
Well, wh-why don't
they look for that?

18:11.220 --> 18:12.787
You find that,
you'll find the real killer.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.658
Or maybe they find
where you planted it.

18:14.702 --> 18:16.573
So, what, I'm
framing someone?

18:16.617 --> 18:18.097
Well, did it
ever occur to you

18:18.140 --> 18:19.881
that someone might
be framing me?Who would bother?

18:19.924 --> 18:20.925
You know the reason I'm here.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.405
You know I have
powerful enemies.

18:22.449 --> 18:24.581
You think my judgment is
swayed by the mayor's friends?

18:24.625 --> 18:27.497
Sit your ass down.

18:27.541 --> 18:30.152
When I was 13,

18:30.196 --> 18:32.676
my mother worked
for a wealthy man as a maid

18:32.720 --> 18:35.418
until one day...

18:36.680 --> 18:40.510
...she was alone in the house...

18:40.554 --> 18:43.296
with him and he...

18:46.386 --> 18:47.604
[chuckles]

18:47.648 --> 18:51.869
Everybody knew what he did,

18:51.913 --> 18:53.828
but because he was rich

18:53.871 --> 18:56.831
and we were immigrants,

18:56.874 --> 18:59.007
the police wouldn't even take
a report.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.707
So, a week later,

19:03.751 --> 19:06.014
to gain access
through his gates,

19:06.057 --> 19:10.323
I dressed as a milkman--
a lechero--

19:10.366 --> 19:14.196
and I made sure that fair
punishment was rendered.

19:14.240 --> 19:18.374
Now you want to tell me
how I favor the rich.

19:21.247 --> 19:25.947
I understand the rules here,
and I respect them.

19:25.990 --> 19:28.341
But why the rush to judgment?

19:28.384 --> 19:30.734
Is there a rule saying
you must convict a suspect

19:30.778 --> 19:33.868
within ten minutes?

19:35.826 --> 19:38.177
No.

19:41.049 --> 19:43.225
We have all the time
in the world.

19:44.357 --> 19:47.142
Thank you.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.926
Now, obviously, I'm
not going anywhere.

19:48.970 --> 19:51.320
If you need to talk again,
I'm gonna be in my cell.

19:51.364 --> 19:52.408
No.

19:52.452 --> 19:54.367
You'll be right here
in this chair.

20:05.813 --> 20:08.424
[clanking]

20:10.861 --> 20:13.299
What the hell
do you want?

20:13.342 --> 20:14.865
I don't like you.

20:14.909 --> 20:16.780
I certainly
don't respect you.

20:16.824 --> 20:18.826
Stop. You're hurting
my feelings.

20:18.869 --> 20:20.523
I've seen
what you're capable of,

20:20.567 --> 20:21.872
but I got to say

20:21.916 --> 20:23.744
I never pegged you
as a murderer.

20:23.787 --> 20:26.268
You think I killed Tyge?

20:26.312 --> 20:29.793
I saw the two of you
in the courtyard this morning.

20:29.837 --> 20:31.708
I was trying to
be nice to him.

20:31.752 --> 20:32.927
He started with me.

20:32.970 --> 20:34.668
Well, if you didn't kill him,
who did?

20:34.711 --> 20:35.625
Not me.

20:35.669 --> 20:36.844
Come on, Brad.

20:36.887 --> 20:38.846
Who wanted him dead besides you?

20:38.889 --> 20:40.195
You really think
I killed that frog?

20:40.239 --> 20:42.937
How many times have I
had you at gunpoint?

20:42.980 --> 20:45.809
You think I didn't want
to pull that trigger?

20:45.853 --> 20:46.897
[sighs]

20:48.856 --> 20:51.511
Hell...

20:51.554 --> 20:54.122
I can't even kill myself.

21:03.174 --> 21:06.265
Hey, you seen anyone see
Whistler go down the stairway?

21:06.308 --> 21:08.005
We only been out here
a minute.

21:08.049 --> 21:09.050
Well, hurry up, then.

21:09.093 --> 21:11.313
The sooner
Whistler dies,

21:11.357 --> 21:13.402
the sooner I can give you
the chicken foot,

21:13.446 --> 21:15.839
or if you prefer, you can
give me the chicken foot--

21:15.883 --> 21:18.277
you know,
try and go out like a man.

21:18.320 --> 21:22.890
Either way, you're getting
in the ring with me today.

21:22.933 --> 21:25.196
[chuckles]

21:30.201 --> 21:33.509
Zylafol. It's used
to anesthetize dogs.

21:33.553 --> 21:37.078
Two drops, and the guard
should be out within an hour.

21:37.121 --> 21:39.428
I was expecting Whistler's
girlfriend to join you.

21:39.472 --> 21:41.604
Where is she?
Around the corner in the car?

21:41.648 --> 21:42.866
She came to me.

21:42.910 --> 21:44.041
I don't mind that
she's helping you.

21:44.085 --> 21:45.956
I mind that you kept it from me.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.175
What difference
does it make?

21:47.218 --> 21:48.742
I mean, we're done
by tomorrow, right?

21:48.785 --> 21:50.309
No more surprises,
Lincoln.

21:52.441 --> 21:53.921
What? Say it.

21:53.964 --> 21:56.358
Can you get any more
pictures of Sara?

21:56.402 --> 21:58.882
Alive? No.

22:00.057 --> 22:02.930
You didn't tell him.

22:02.973 --> 22:05.802
You didn't tell Michael
that Sara's dead.

22:05.846 --> 22:08.065
Can we get pictures or not?

22:08.109 --> 22:10.198
I'm sure we can cobble
something together,

22:10.241 --> 22:13.114
but smart move not
telling your brother.

22:13.157 --> 22:15.334
He seems a little sensitive
to me.

22:16.552 --> 22:19.512
This is the exchange point--
LJ and I will be waiting.

22:19.555 --> 22:21.252
You, Michael and Whistler
will meet us there.

22:21.296 --> 22:25.300
Everything goes as
planned, you'll have
your son back by 9:00.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.693
Lincoln?

22:26.736 --> 22:28.347
9:00.

22:43.579 --> 22:44.885
Which one is it?

22:44.928 --> 22:46.626
I don't know,
I think it's the taller one.

22:46.669 --> 22:48.932
The other one is always
drinking orange juice.You sure?

22:48.976 --> 22:50.281
I think so,
I'm not completely sure,

22:50.325 --> 22:52.153
but they all look the same.Hey!

23:20.964 --> 23:22.966
[gasps]
Hey!

23:23.010 --> 23:24.533
Watch where you're going!

23:24.577 --> 23:25.360
Here, look, uh...

23:25.404 --> 23:26.883
this is a buddy's, please.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.319
Please, I insist.

23:30.713 --> 23:31.888
No really.

23:31.932 --> 23:33.499
Toma, toma.

23:33.542 --> 23:34.587
Toma.

23:35.892 --> 23:38.068
Man, I...

23:38.112 --> 23:38.982
Thank you anyway.

23:39.026 --> 23:40.897
Excuse me, Señor.

23:40.941 --> 23:42.464
I need to go
to Sona.

23:42.508 --> 23:43.944
I...

23:43.987 --> 23:45.467
my car's run out
of gas and--I'm sorry.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.295
I'm, I'm heading in the wrong,
wrong direction.

23:47.338 --> 23:49.210
I really need to go
to Sona.

23:52.735 --> 23:54.433
Thank you.

23:57.784 --> 23:59.133
Watch the lid.

24:14.627 --> 24:16.193
My condolences.

24:16.237 --> 24:19.545
You finally make a friend,
and now he's about to die.

24:19.588 --> 24:20.763
Damn shame.

24:20.807 --> 24:22.765
You can stop it, you know.

24:22.809 --> 24:24.288
If you hadn't noticed,

24:24.332 --> 24:27.466
my position enables me
to hear things.

24:30.164 --> 24:32.340
I'm listening.

24:32.383 --> 24:34.342
The only proof Lechero's got is

24:34.385 --> 24:36.213
that your man went down
that staircase, right?

24:36.257 --> 24:37.214
What if you had more compelling

24:37.258 --> 24:39.129
evidence?
Well, I don't.

24:39.173 --> 24:40.304
But if you did...

24:40.348 --> 24:42.002
You're suggesting
I make something up?

24:42.045 --> 24:43.525
If it makes your conscience
feel better,

24:43.569 --> 24:45.092
then blame it on somebody
who deserves it.

24:45.135 --> 24:46.180
Someone who's killed before

24:46.223 --> 24:47.094
and gone unpunished.

24:47.137 --> 24:48.530
Yeah, like you, maybe.

24:48.574 --> 24:50.576
Sammy.

24:54.188 --> 24:56.146
You want me
to tell Lechero

24:56.190 --> 24:58.192
that his right hand man
should die?

24:58.235 --> 25:02.196
You don't tell
Lechero squat.

25:02.239 --> 25:03.980
Lechero knows

25:04.024 --> 25:05.068
this is Sammy's ring.

25:05.112 --> 25:07.027
If you drop it

25:07.070 --> 25:08.289
in the blood by the staircase,

25:08.332 --> 25:10.073
then yell up to Lechero
what you've found...

25:10.117 --> 25:11.335
the whole entire

25:11.379 --> 25:13.033
prison will hear
clear-cut evidence

25:13.076 --> 25:15.165
of Sammy's guilt.

25:15.209 --> 25:18.517
Lechero will have no
choice but to comply.

25:23.260 --> 25:26.350
This is Sona.

25:26.394 --> 25:28.527
Don't you worry your pretty
little head about it.

25:28.570 --> 25:31.051
All you have to do is drop
the ring in the blood

25:31.094 --> 25:32.139
and say it was Sammy.

25:32.182 --> 25:34.533
I'll take care
of the rest.

25:37.057 --> 25:39.102
You want to save your
friend's life?

25:39.146 --> 25:42.410
Someone else has to die.

26:31.459 --> 26:34.070

From what
I just heard,

26:35.202 --> 26:36.333
he knew something
about you?

26:36.377 --> 26:39.119
He thought he knew something
about me.

26:39.162 --> 26:40.990
Opportunity
and a motive.

26:41.034 --> 26:42.296
That's not a good
combination.

26:42.339 --> 26:43.558
You must know there's
discontent

26:43.602 --> 26:45.255
from many prisoners
over how you run Sona.

26:45.299 --> 26:48.128
Now would not be a good time
to insult me.

26:48.171 --> 26:50.652
No. No, no, my point is this:

26:50.696 --> 26:53.176
you execute me,
you get your swift justice

26:53.220 --> 26:54.438
and you may placate the masses.

26:54.482 --> 26:55.788
But when they find out
who really did it...

26:55.831 --> 26:58.138
they will know
you killed an innocent man.

26:58.181 --> 27:00.183
You're still not answering
my question.

27:00.227 --> 27:01.271
What was your disagreement
with Tyge?

27:01.315 --> 27:02.882
He was a nosy guy.

27:02.925 --> 27:04.100
He got into my business.

27:04.144 --> 27:05.406
I'm sure he did the same
with someone else,

27:05.449 --> 27:06.755
and that's what got him killed.

27:06.799 --> 27:08.714
Would you just admit
that you had an argument?

27:08.757 --> 27:10.193
This is prison.

27:10.237 --> 27:11.325
If someone makes false
accusations, I can't back down.

one of your questions.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.157

taken care of.

29:43.477 --> 29:44.565
Well, that's encouraging,

I get dragged down here.

33:03.938 --> 33:04.983
Yeah, I'm sure
it was really hard

33:05.026 --> 33:06.636
to convince you
to come down here.

33:06.680 --> 33:09.900
I'm gonna be honest.

Once the special

33:33.489 --> 33:34.621
you'll be
on your way.

Whoa.

33:35.709 --> 33:37.363
What about a special prosecutor?

33:37.406 --> 33:38.625
You stand in front of a guy,

33:38.668 --> 33:40.061
you, you tell your story
and he determines

33:40.105 --> 33:42.411
if you're gonna be a useful
and credible witness.

33:42.455 --> 33:43.412
It's a formality.

This is just a formality?

33:47.547 --> 33:48.896
You know, if it were up to me,

33:48.939 --> 33:51.551
you could rot in here
for the rest of your life.

33:51.594 --> 33:53.640
But the Justice Department

33:53.683 --> 33:55.729
is extremely motivated
to get to the bottom

percent above board.

in Mahone's cell?

35:26.994 --> 35:28.430
Doesn't that prove I'm innocent?

35:28.474 --> 35:29.866
You're a joke!

35:29.910 --> 35:31.172
You talk about equality.

35:31.216 --> 35:32.956
You talk justice,
but at the end of the day

35:33.000 --> 35:34.741
you're a dictator,
and just like any dictator,

35:34.784 --> 35:36.003
you're terrified
of losing your power.

35:36.046 --> 35:38.136
It'd be very unwise
to go any further.

35:38.179 --> 35:40.007
You don't care who
the real killer is

35:40.050 --> 35:41.748
just as long as you get
to string somebody up.

35:41.791 --> 35:43.358
That's all that
matters to you, isn't it?

35:43.402 --> 35:46.187
I've determined who's guilty,
and the punishment is death.

35:46.231 --> 35:47.841
You're making a mistake.
This is murder!

35:47.884 --> 35:49.059
You know it and I know it!

35:49.103 --> 35:51.627
At least have the
guts to admit it!

35:51.671 --> 35:52.759
You're right!

35:52.802 --> 35:54.021
It's murder.

Don't!

36:14.868 --> 36:16.348
I found this
in the yard.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.744
Augusto used to give
them to me as tribute.

36:21.788 --> 36:24.704
And now you reek of them.

36:34.757 --> 36:36.890
Go.

[vehicle approaching]

37:56.143 --> 37:58.972
I question your
love for your son.

37:59.015 --> 38:01.888
He was two seconds away
from being decapitated

38:01.931 --> 38:03.455
because of you.

38:03.498 --> 38:04.804
I told you the truth.

38:04.847 --> 38:06.153
Maybe.

38:06.196 --> 38:07.763
But if you have
anything else planned,

38:07.807 --> 38:09.025
now it's scrapped.

38:09.069 --> 38:11.506
Because what happens
if you try something?

38:11.550 --> 38:13.769
I know.

38:13.813 --> 38:15.336
Oh, good.

38:22.256 --> 38:24.780
This is the same newspaper she
was holding in the last picture.

38:24.824 --> 38:25.912
That's what my guy could get.

38:25.955 --> 38:27.348
You didn't give me
a lot of time.

38:27.392 --> 38:29.263
You think Michael's
not going to notice this?

38:29.307 --> 38:32.397
Yeah. "Hey, Michael,
here's the pictures."

38:32.440 --> 38:34.050
He's going to want
to see this close up.

38:34.094 --> 38:36.357
I'm done doing favors for you.

38:36.401 --> 38:37.227
Get out.

38:37.271 --> 38:39.012
I'll see you
in an hour.

[engine starting]

39:04.994 --> 39:06.866
No football today?

39:06.909 --> 39:08.911
No, no football today.

39:12.915 --> 39:15.265
You're my brother, Sammy?

39:17.790 --> 39:19.269
Of course.

39:41.596 --> 39:42.684
MICHAEL:
It's done?

39:42.728 --> 39:44.643
The guard will be asleep
in a half hour.

39:44.686 --> 39:45.861
So we're good.

39:45.905 --> 39:48.168
Not quite.

39:48.211 --> 39:51.432
They, uh, they know we're
breaking out this afternoon.

39:54.609 --> 39:55.915
You told her?

39:55.958 --> 39:57.090
Man, she worked it out...

39:57.133 --> 39:58.787
Why didn't you lie?She worked it out.

39:58.831 --> 40:01.486
So what are we gonna do to get
the upper hand here, Linc?

40:01.529 --> 40:03.357
Nothing.
You think they're
just going to turn over

40:03.401 --> 40:05.098
LJ and Sara?This is too dangerous.

40:05.141 --> 40:06.491
If we try anything,
they're just going to...

40:06.534 --> 40:08.101
What, hurt them?

40:09.407 --> 40:11.931
No, not if they want us to
deliver on Whistler, they won't.

40:11.974 --> 40:14.020
We're playing this one straight.

40:14.063 --> 40:16.022
No games. No surprises.

40:16.065 --> 40:18.590
All right?

40:18.633 --> 40:20.287
Show me the pictures.

40:22.245 --> 40:25.466
Show me the pictures, Linc.

40:25.510 --> 40:26.989
Come on...

40:27.033 --> 40:29.209
The pictures.

40:29.252 --> 40:32.430
I can't show you
the pictures, man.

40:35.781 --> 40:37.739
Why not, Linc?

40:45.181 --> 40:47.488
She's dead, Michael.

40:52.667 --> 40:54.060
I lied to you.

40:54.103 --> 40:56.323
I'm sorry.

40:56.366 --> 40:59.108
If you don't break out today,
they're going to kill my son.

40:59.152 --> 41:01.633
They're going to kill LJ.

41:03.199 --> 41:04.897
Michael, we've
got to do this.
