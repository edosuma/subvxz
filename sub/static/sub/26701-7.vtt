WEBVTT

01:35.470 --> 01:36.763
The staircase is a wreck.

01:38.056 --> 01:40.350
We're not getting up there without ropes.

01:41.309 --> 01:42.143
Start looking.

01:45.396 --> 01:46.231
Damn.

01:47.774 --> 01:48.900
This is gonna be hard.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.160
We don't need ropes.

02:02.580 --> 02:03.414
Here we go.

03:29.250 --> 03:33.713
Well, I didn't want to leave it in there
to melt and ruin all your beautiful books.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.382
It seems damp enough out here as it is.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.010
Oh, but look...

03:43.431 --> 03:44.474
You did it, Sypha.

03:45.099 --> 03:50.063
Yes, but... seeing it
is something else entirely.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.024
I'm pretty good, right?

03:53.900 --> 03:54.817
You're the best.

03:55.693 --> 03:56.694
Alucard.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.529
Are you ready for this?

03:59.781 --> 04:00.615
No.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.327
But let's put an end to this anyway.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.325
I terrify them. Sypha disorients them.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.619
Alucard goes over the top
and we support him.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.288
Yes.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.126
Begin.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.127
Your son is here.

09:47.211 --> 09:49.213
Alucard has entered the castle?

09:49.338 --> 09:51.048
And a woman who stinks of magic...

09:52.508 --> 09:53.342
...and a hunter.

09:55.845 --> 09:56.679
To your study.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.017
Behind me, Dracula.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.644
They will not reach you while I live.

10:04.353 --> 10:07.857
You would give your mortal life
to preserve my immortal one?

10:08.774 --> 10:10.067
To save your genius?

10:10.526 --> 10:12.236
Your knowledge, and your will?

10:12.945 --> 10:13.821
Without question.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.365
I am just a forgemaster.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.410
Yours is the wisdom of ages.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.123
You are the greatest
of your people, Isaac.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.959
You have a soul, I think.

10:27.918 --> 10:30.546
Perhaps that is more valuable
to the world to come

10:31.088 --> 10:33.966
than a dusty collection
of books and apparatus.

10:35.301 --> 10:39.096
Or perhaps you simply deserve
a better fate than to die instead of me.

10:40.306 --> 10:44.101
I choose my death, as I chose my life.

10:46.729 --> 10:49.398
Then I regret only that
I have taken a choice for you.

10:59.367 --> 11:04.080
No! Dracula! No!

11:32.024 --> 11:32.858
Father.

11:34.985 --> 11:35.820
Son.

11:38.322 --> 11:39.907
Your war is over.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.452
Because you say so?

11:45.913 --> 11:46.789
It ends.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.500
In the name of my mother.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.795
It endures in the name of your mother.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.798
I told you before, I won't let you do it.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.509
I grieve with you...

12:00.136 --> 12:02.012
but I won't let you commit genocide.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.224
You couldn't stop me before.

12:07.476 --> 12:09.145
I was alone before.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.072
Speaker magician!

13:11.123 --> 13:12.249
Sypha!

13:15.711 --> 13:18.297
You must be the Belmont.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.470
The end of your line.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.892
The Morningstar whip.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.477
Well played, Belmont.

14:56.478 --> 15:03.152
But I am no ordinary vampire
to be killed by your human magics.

15:03.736 --> 15:08.782
I am Vlad Dracula Tepes,
and I have had enough!

17:05.482 --> 17:06.984
You mean to stake me?

17:07.860 --> 17:08.736
You want me to.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.112
What?

17:10.446 --> 17:11.822
You didn't kill me before.

17:12.614 --> 17:13.991
You're not going to kill me now.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.910
You want this to end as much as I do.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.454
Do I?!

17:19.705 --> 17:22.124
You died when my mother died.
You know you did.

17:23.125 --> 17:27.129
This entire catastrophe has been nothing
but history's longest suicide note.

17:31.550 --> 17:35.345
Not quite close enough.

17:42.770 --> 17:43.771
Next floor up.

17:43.896 --> 17:44.730
I hear them.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.499
It's your room.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.116
My boy.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.077
I'm--

20:05.829 --> 20:07.289
I'm killing my boy.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.296
Lisa.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.131
I'm killing our boy.

20:18.133 --> 20:22.137
We painted this room.
We... made these toys.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.349
It's our boy, Lisa.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.404
Your greatest gift to me.

20:40.697 --> 20:41.990
And I'm killing him.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.580
I must already be dead.

21:14.439 --> 21:15.565
Son.

21:16.149 --> 21:16.984
Father.

22:22.883 --> 22:23.717
Alucard.

22:24.051 --> 22:24.885
Step back.

22:26.344 --> 22:27.429
Let me finish this.

23:29.783 --> 23:32.327
Is... Is that it?

23:32.911 --> 23:33.745
Alucard.

23:35.288 --> 23:36.957
Did we... do it?

23:40.043 --> 23:40.877
We did.

23:44.381 --> 23:45.215
I...

23:47.717 --> 23:48.635
killed my father.

23:49.886 --> 23:51.888
You ended a war on humankind.

23:53.014 --> 23:54.266
Don't get weepy about it.

23:57.102 --> 23:57.936
Trevor's right.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.772
You've saved countless lives.

24:03.525 --> 24:06.570
But it's all right to mourn the man, too.

24:13.243 --> 24:15.203
He died a long time ago.
