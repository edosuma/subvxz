<i>How did you come to
be here in this gray place?</i>

00:15.807 --> 00:19.175
<i>Were you back in into the cold
by something larger than you?</i>

00:26.151 --> 00:27.312
<i>You were flush</i>

00:28.403 --> 00:29.403
<i>and vibrant...</i>

00:31.198 --> 00:33.030
<i>now covered in mist,</i>

00:36.620 --> 00:38.361
<i>a wasted match stick.</i>

00:44.545 --> 00:46.411
<i>Were you deceived into life?</i>

00:52.594 --> 00:55.052
<i>Was your heart cut so untruly?</i>

01:07.651 --> 01:09.108
<i>Let me hold you...</i>

01:12.406 --> 01:14.944
<i>take you to the
places notyet known,</i>

<i>This, I promise.</i>

01:43.604 --> 01:44.970
<i>I promise.</i>

01:58.410 --> 02:00.322
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

02:03.123 --> 02:04.123
<i>Aaron?</i>

02:12.341 --> 02:13.457
<i>I'm here.</i>

02:19.264 --> 02:20.550
<i>I'm here.</i>

02:26.229 --> 02:27.845
<i>Now, breathe.</i>

02:40.619 --> 02:42.076
Come on!

02:42.245 --> 02:44.932
- <i>Hey, man, what's up?</i>
- Sam! I need you to come and get me right now.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.073
<i>- Woohoo, slow down bro.</i>
- Sam, shut up!

02:47.209 --> 02:49.326
I need you right now,
okay, right now.

02:49.461 --> 02:50.747
I'm in a rest stop off 26.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.711
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>
- Off...

02:52.839 --> 02:54.296
Jesus Christ,
are you for real, man?

02:54.424 --> 02:56.416
- Right now...
<i>- Chill out, okay.</i>

02:58.512 --> 03:01.550
- Sam, now.
<i>- What happened dude?</i>

03:01.682 --> 03:03.469
I'll tell you when you get here.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.600
<i>Where?</i>

03:06.978 --> 03:10.722
Rest stop off 26, come get me!

03:10.857 --> 03:13.850
<i>- Jesus, just drive.</i>
- Drive? No. I...

03:13.985 --> 03:14.985
I don't have the truck.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.936
I'm in a bathroom
and I'm bleeding.

03:17.072 --> 03:17.822
- I'm hurt...
<i>- You're what?</i>

03:17.823 --> 03:19.425
If you have a kit,
bring it, I don't care,

03:19.449 --> 03:21.862
just put your jacket on,
get in your car and come and get me!

03:21.993 --> 03:24.326
<i>Aaron, where's Elijah?</i>

03:28.250 --> 03:29.957
Look, I'm just
freaking out, man.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.757
Hello. Hello!

03:42.723 --> 03:44.134
- Shit.
- Excuse me, sir.

03:44.266 --> 03:48.886
I'm Officer Burgess,
can you step outside, please?

03:49.020 --> 03:50.081
<i>Aaron, are you there?</i>

03:50.105 --> 03:52.313
Appreciate your cooperation.

03:52.441 --> 03:53.898
Oh, yeah...

03:54.025 --> 03:55.857
- Sir?
- Yeah, in a minute.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.443
<i>Dude, what's going on?</i>

03:57.571 --> 03:59.654
It's a cop, there's a cop.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.341
Last time I'm gonna tell you.
I need you to come out...

04:02.367 --> 04:03.594
<i>Tell him
you're taking a piss.</i>

04:03.618 --> 04:05.325
No, wait,
I'm taking a piss.

04:05.454 --> 04:07.682
- <i>Tell him you're using the bathroom.</i>
- Shut the fuck up.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.242
Step outside right now.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.410
Oh!

04:10.542 --> 04:12.659
Just... just give me a second.

04:12.794 --> 04:15.161
Open up!
I'm ordering you! Open up.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.921
- <i>Alright. I'm... I'm on the way. I'm coming!</i>
- Hurry up!

04:18.048 --> 04:20.236
- Stop resisting.
<i>- Where's Elijah anyway?</i>

04:20.260 --> 04:22.029
- Open up right now!
- Jesus Christ!

04:22.053 --> 04:24.413
<i>You can't let him in.
Just tell him to fucking go away</i>

04:24.514 --> 04:26.130
- Open up, sir!
<i>- Aaron.</i>

04:26.266 --> 04:28.508
<i>Aaron. Aaron!</i>

04:43.116 --> 04:44.232
<i>Aaron.</i>

04:49.456 --> 04:50.822
Aaron!

05:01.134 --> 05:02.134
<i>Come on, Aaron!</i>

05:04.054 --> 05:05.215
<i>Answer me.</i>

05:06.848 --> 05:07.848
<i>Aaron!</i>

05:19.694 --> 05:21.026
<i>Pick up!</i>

05:21.154 --> 05:22.361
<i>Pick up the phone.</i>

05:29.746 --> 05:33.490
<i>Aaron! What the fuck,
Aaron, come on? Answer me.</i>

05:33.625 --> 05:34.625
Yeah.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.000
<i>Holy shit, Aaron!</i>

05:36.127 --> 05:38.039
<i>- Are you okay?</i>
- Yeah.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.457
Yeah, I'm...

05:39.589 --> 05:41.376
<i>- Okay, I'm... I'm coming.</i>
- Please.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.374
<i>- I'm coming, I'm on the way.</i>
- Yeah.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.921
<i>I'll be there soon. Stay there.</i>

05:45.053 --> 05:46.053
Yeah, okay.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.340
<i>Okay, I'm on the way.</i>

05:54.563 --> 05:56.099
<i>Is this our beginning?</i>

05:57.232 --> 05:58.768
<i>So many of us,</i>

06:00.235 --> 06:01.396
<i>each unique,</i>

06:02.654 --> 06:07.274
<i>toiled, imprinted on the other,</i>

06:09.202 --> 06:11.444
<i>our whole lives ahead of us,</i>

06:11.580 --> 06:13.162
<i>free to choose,</i>

06:14.332 --> 06:18.997
<i>only parts of the greater whole
marshaled into our place,</i>

06:19.129 --> 06:22.873
<i>so close, never to touch.</i>

06:24.009 --> 06:25.250
<i>Can you feel them?</i>

06:26.219 --> 06:29.087
<i>Billions of lives apart like us?</i>

06:30.974 --> 06:33.182
<i>Should it be across
the cradle of time</i>

06:33.310 --> 06:35.893
<i>from every soul there ever was,</i>

06:37.397 --> 06:39.263
<i>mine would find yours?</i>

06:40.317 --> 06:42.730
<i>How is that anything but fate?</i>

07:00.962 --> 07:01.962
<i>Aaron?</i>

07:05.383 --> 07:07.124
- Yeah.
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

07:07.260 --> 07:09.468
<i>Aaron, Ijust got off the
phone with Sam, he said...</i>

07:09.596 --> 07:11.588
Yeah, yeah, it's okay.

07:12.849 --> 07:16.559
<i>Oh! Are... are you hurt?</i>

07:17.646 --> 07:18.646
No.

07:18.647 --> 07:21.105
<i>- Goddammit, Aaron, talk to me.</i>
- I'm here.

07:22.692 --> 07:27.278
<i>You gotta talk to me,
baby, what happened?</i>

07:27.405 --> 07:28.405
Sam...

07:29.366 --> 07:32.074
Is... is Sam coming for me?

07:32.202 --> 07:34.740
I mean, he called you,
he's coming for me, right?

07:34.871 --> 07:36.828
<i>Yeah, yeah, he said...</i>

07:36.957 --> 07:40.701
<i>he said that he's picking you
at a rest stop somewhere.</i>

07:40.835 --> 07:42.855
<i>He said you're at some rest
stop, but Aaron, he said...</i>

07:42.879 --> 07:44.165
<i>he said he heard gun shots.</i>

07:44.297 --> 07:45.583
<i>He said thatyou might be hurt.</i>

07:45.715 --> 07:47.818
<i>- He said thatyou're freaking out right now.</i>
- No, no, no, no.

07:47.842 --> 07:50.004
I don't want you to worry
about that, okay?

07:51.888 --> 07:53.470
I don't want you
to worry about that.

07:55.684 --> 07:56.684
I'm...

08:05.485 --> 08:06.601
I need you.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.067
<i>My God, Aaron.</i>

08:13.410 --> 08:14.571
<i>What happened?</i>

08:22.794 --> 08:24.080
I think I killed someone.

08:33.471 --> 08:34.552
<i>Uhm...</i>

08:38.559 --> 08:39.559
<i>Okay.</i>

08:43.523 --> 08:44.809
<i>Okay.</i>

08:45.984 --> 08:47.316
I think he might be dead.

08:47.444 --> 08:48.685
<i>Uhm...</i>

08:50.155 --> 08:53.239
<i>Are you okay?</i>

09:01.541 --> 09:02.458
I have to go.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.745
<i>No, no, no, no, Aaron,</i>

09:03.877 --> 09:05.980
<i>you can't hang up on me right now,
don't hang up on me, please...</i>

09:06.004 --> 09:07.666
Baby, I love you.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.255
I love you so much,
but I have to go, okay?

09:10.383 --> 09:11.590
I have to.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.256
<i>Aaron, don't, please, do not
hang up on me right now!</i>

09:14.387 --> 09:16.504
<i>You can't hang up on
me right now, please...</i>

10:21.454 --> 10:22.535
<i>Hey, it's Vern.</i>

10:22.664 --> 10:24.826
<i>Sorry I didn't catch you.
Leave it at the beep.</i>

10:35.176 --> 10:37.168
This is some Shakespearean shit.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.130
Hello in there.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.556
Hello?

10:47.689 --> 10:48.930
How are you doing?

10:49.065 --> 10:51.648
I'm Lieutenant Arnold Koch.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.142
I'm here to talk with you.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.650
Can you talk to me?

10:56.781 --> 11:00.195
Look, I'm just here to talk
with you, is that okay?

11:00.326 --> 11:01.326
Yeah.

11:01.452 --> 11:02.784
Great, good.

11:02.912 --> 11:06.405
First, I need to ask you
if everyone in there is okay,

11:06.541 --> 11:08.453
if you're not hurt or anything?

11:08.585 --> 11:10.042
Get to the point.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.996
Is there anyone
with you in there?

11:16.092 --> 11:17.092
Anyone?

11:20.555 --> 11:21.555
Hello?

11:25.977 --> 11:27.639
I have my girlfriend

11:29.772 --> 11:30.772
and you better...

11:32.567 --> 11:34.684
You better back
the fuck up, man!

11:34.819 --> 11:35.819
Back it up!

11:35.862 --> 11:37.756
All right, please,
listen to what I'm saying...

11:37.780 --> 11:39.066
No, you listen!

11:39.199 --> 11:41.942
Back the fuck up,
man, you hear me?

11:42.076 --> 11:43.817
All right, all right.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.696
We're gonna work on a message
to talk to you a little better, okay?

11:46.831 --> 11:50.074
Fine! Just give me
some space! Back it up!

12:08.519 --> 12:11.182
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

12:34.712 --> 12:37.671
<i>Your soul was born
in the heart of a dying star.</i>

12:41.010 --> 12:42.421
<i>You were not flesh.</i>

12:43.805 --> 12:47.594
<i>You were something
more... elemental.</i>

12:49.269 --> 12:51.761
<i>Heaven beneath the soft earth.</i>

12:57.485 --> 12:59.568
<i>You were light made to breathe.</i>

13:03.157 --> 13:04.157
Hey in there.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.163
Hello!

13:11.374 --> 13:13.240
Yeah.

13:13.376 --> 13:14.412
It's Arnold Koch.

13:14.544 --> 13:17.127
Yeah,
Lieutenant Koch, got it.

13:18.756 --> 13:19.916
Hey, what's your name?

13:21.092 --> 13:22.333
Are you all right in there?

13:23.261 --> 13:25.878
Listen, man, I'm not
giving you my name,

13:26.014 --> 13:27.505
and you're not getting in here.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.506
Do me a favor though, back up.

13:31.019 --> 13:33.932
I know you
must be feeling scared,

13:35.315 --> 13:37.181
maybe regretful.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.058
- Now, I'd like to listen...
- Mitch.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.818
Excuse me?

13:41.946 --> 13:44.859
Mitch. I'm gonna say
my name is Mitch.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.199
It's my eighth grade
algebra teacher.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.404
Your teacher?
Did he mean a lot to you?

13:51.539 --> 13:53.201
You want a name, there you go.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.705
Okay then,
Mitch, thank you.

13:58.963 --> 14:03.003
Hey, Mitch, I need to know
how many people are in there.

14:03.134 --> 14:06.298
Well, it's me, my girlfriend,

14:06.429 --> 14:08.091
and fuck off!

14:08.222 --> 14:11.966
Mitch, if you don't help me,
then I can't help you. These guys...

14:12.101 --> 14:15.970
Oh, you're pulling every trick
in the book, man, every single trick!

14:17.065 --> 14:20.274
"Oh, you must be feeling
scared and regretful."

14:20.401 --> 14:22.142
"Oh, did your teacher
mean a lot to you?"

14:22.278 --> 14:24.019
"Oh, Mitch, Mitch, Mitch."

14:24.155 --> 14:26.989
Like you care what my name is.

14:27.116 --> 14:31.326
Let me make this shit as crystal
clear as I can, Lieutenant!

14:31.454 --> 14:34.413
I'm not coming out and
you're not getting in.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.873
And I swear to God, if
you try and make a move,

14:38.252 --> 14:39.459
bitches die!

14:40.838 --> 14:41.838
Got it?

14:43.132 --> 14:46.421
I don't think bloodshed
is the best way to end this, Mitch.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.344
Now, I'm here to help you.

14:50.932 --> 14:52.514
I wanna know
your side of things.

14:55.645 --> 14:59.605
There's nothing you can do that
you can't turn back from.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.317
Okay?

15:03.945 --> 15:05.982
You can turn this around.

15:06.114 --> 15:10.199
All you need to do
is open that door.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.864
I don't think so, Lieutenant.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.537
The way I see it, this door
is all I have right now.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.953
I think I'll hang on
to it just a bit longer.

15:29.470 --> 15:30.836
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

15:43.109 --> 15:44.316
<i>I'm here.</i>

15:53.953 --> 15:56.696
<i>Hey, it's Vern.
Sorry I didn't catch you.</i>

15:58.082 --> 15:59.414
Oh, this is Vern,

15:59.542 --> 16:02.250
I can't pick up right now
because my phone is in my ass.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.067
- Hey, man.
<i>- Hey.</i>

17:17.203 --> 17:18.569
- Are you here?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

17:18.704 --> 17:19.704
Awesome.

17:19.704 --> 17:23.449
Listen, Sam, I need
you to charge the cop.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.325
- <i>What?</i>
- Bum-rush him.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.123
<i>What? No dude.</i>

17:27.255 --> 17:28.871
Listen, Sam, hit him.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.566
I can't get out of
here unless I have...

17:30.591 --> 17:32.277
<i>I can't do that, man,
are you... are you nuts?</i>

17:32.301 --> 17:33.633
Just do this for me, man. Just...

17:33.761 --> 17:35.798
We're almost at the
finish line, okay?

17:35.930 --> 17:38.593
<i>You don't understand, man,
the place is crawling.</i>

17:40.142 --> 17:41.223
- What?
<i>- Yeah, dude.</i>

17:41.352 --> 17:44.220
<i>I'd count like eight cop cars,
Five-O's everywhere.</i>

17:47.191 --> 17:48.307
Fuck!

17:49.694 --> 17:51.560
Fuck!

17:51.696 --> 17:53.232
<i>Yeah, fuck is right.</i>

17:53.364 --> 17:57.529
I thought it was just one dude.
Stupid, stupid!

17:57.660 --> 17:59.196
<i>Yeah, well, it ain't.</i>

17:59.328 --> 18:00.660
Shit!

18:00.788 --> 18:02.780
Well, that fucks up my plan.

18:02.915 --> 18:06.329
<i>What? Your plan
was for me to hit a cop?</i>

18:06.460 --> 18:09.168
Yeah, and run.

18:09.297 --> 18:11.630
Shit, shit, shit!

18:11.757 --> 18:13.339
<i>What now, dog?</i>

18:13.467 --> 18:15.504
I don't know yet,
man, I'm thinking.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.878
<i>Well, they look like
they mean business, bro.</i>

18:18.014 --> 18:20.131
<i>I could see one dude,
his gun pointed at the door.</i>

18:21.559 --> 18:23.425
Don't fucking tell me
there's a SWAT team.

18:23.561 --> 18:24.561
<i>No.</i>

18:25.438 --> 18:26.929
Good.

18:27.064 --> 18:30.557
<i>What the fuck did you do,
man, to piss them off?</i>

18:30.693 --> 18:32.480
It's been a day.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.650
<i>Yeah. Where's Elijah?</i>

18:37.199 --> 18:38.158
He bailed.

18:38.159 --> 18:39.159
- Hey...
<i>- What?</i>

18:39.160 --> 18:40.526
Sam, do me a favor.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.323
- I need you...
<i>- Bailed?</i>

18:42.455 --> 18:47.371
Yeah. Sam, I need this favor,
all right? Can you see the door?

18:48.461 --> 18:49.747
<i>Yeah, the pisser, right?</i>

18:49.879 --> 18:51.836
Yeah, see the holes?

18:51.964 --> 18:54.798
<i>Holy shit, was thatyou?
You did that?</i>

18:54.925 --> 18:55.925
Kinda had to.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.209
<i>Shit, man.</i>

18:57.345 --> 19:00.133
Yeah. Can you like...

19:01.390 --> 19:02.881
Can you like...

19:04.101 --> 19:10.098
Can you see if there's blood
on the door, can you see?

19:16.113 --> 19:17.030
<i>No, man.</i>

19:19.700 --> 19:21.862
No?

19:21.994 --> 19:24.077
<i>I can't see anything.</i>

19:24.246 --> 19:29.332
An ambulance, a fucking body bag,
anything, anything at all?

19:29.460 --> 19:31.702
<i>I see a dude with a camera
snapping pictures. That's it.</i>

19:31.837 --> 19:34.204
<i>But listen, man, I gotta
bounce, I gotta back off.</i>

19:34.340 --> 19:36.300
<i>It looks sketch as hell
me sitting here like this.</i>

19:36.425 --> 19:39.088
<i>- And I'm carrying, so...</i>
- Yeah, do what you gotta do.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.303
<i>We'll figure
something out. All right?</i>

19:41.430 --> 19:42.716
<i>I ain't leaving you.</i>

19:42.848 --> 19:45.056
I really appreciate
it, man, thanks.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.891
<i>I know,
I'm a peach. Just...</i>

19:48.229 --> 19:49.229
<i>You okay?</i>

20:10.126 --> 20:12.163
<i>How does
the light blind us?</i>

20:16.966 --> 20:18.707
<i>Carry us in its glow?</i>

20:23.389 --> 20:25.506
<i>Reveal to us the world?</i>

20:29.311 --> 20:31.394
<i>We live so little
of its spectrum.</i>

20:34.900 --> 20:37.142
<i>Drink in so little
of its warmth.</i>

20:41.699 --> 20:46.160
<i>Wrapped in it and
blind to its nature.</i>

21:36.921 --> 21:38.037
<i>Hey, it's Vern.</i>

21:38.172 --> 21:41.040
<i>Sorry I didn't catch you.
Leave it at the beep.</i>

21:41.175 --> 21:42.175
Motherfucker.

21:42.176 --> 21:43.176
Mitch?

21:46.430 --> 21:47.430
Yeah.

21:48.891 --> 21:51.178
I still like to hear things
from your point of view.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.978
You know, I don't
really feel like talking.

21:55.105 --> 21:56.937
That's okay. It's okay.

21:58.192 --> 21:59.192
Okay then.

22:01.362 --> 22:03.479
You have
a phone in there, Mitch?

22:03.614 --> 22:04.614
So what?

22:04.615 --> 22:06.527
Maybe we can talk
together on the phone.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.016
You would think
that would be easier.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.740
No, I need to take this.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.612
You need to talk with me, Mitch.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.580
We're talking,
we're just talking.

22:14.708 --> 22:18.201
But right now, I wanna
hear from your girlfriend, okay?

22:18.337 --> 22:19.919
Jesus, would you shut up?

22:20.047 --> 22:21.413
We have to know she's okay.

22:21.549 --> 22:24.667
She's fine! I'm making a phone call
right now, give me a minute.

22:24.802 --> 22:26.488
We have to know she's okay.

22:26.512 --> 22:27.512
Piss off!

22:27.638 --> 22:29.518
- <i>What the fuck, dude?</i>
- Vern, goddammit!

22:29.557 --> 22:30.992
I've been trying
to reach you all night.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.223
<i>I'm in a movie, bro.</i>

22:32.351 --> 22:35.264
Well, you picked a hell of night, dumb shit.
Elijah and I did our thing.

22:35.437 --> 22:36.437
<i>Just now?</i>

22:36.564 --> 22:38.271
I don't know, man,
like an hour ago.

22:38.399 --> 22:40.561
<i>Well,
this ain't eBay. Okay?</i>

22:40.693 --> 22:43.481
<i>I can't exactly get rid of the
jewels this fucking second.</i>

22:43.612 --> 22:45.353
<i>I thoughtyou were
waiting a few days anyway.</i>

22:45.489 --> 22:48.357
Vern, shut the fuck up.
Shit went south, man, real bad.

22:50.703 --> 22:51.619
<i>Gone?</i>

22:51.620 --> 22:55.785
Like motherfucker behind the
counter pulled a knife, yes.

22:55.916 --> 22:59.284
<i>Okay, okay,
butyou got this shit, right?</i>

22:59.461 --> 23:00.461
Yeah, but...

23:02.464 --> 23:03.921
<i>But what?</i>

23:04.049 --> 23:06.166
I'm up the creek, man,
the cops got me.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.464
<i>What the fuck, you fucking...</i>

23:08.596 --> 23:11.464
Vern, Vern, chill
the fuck out, man.

23:11.599 --> 23:13.465
I'm not under arrest,
I'm hiding.

23:13.601 --> 23:15.718
<i>So, what? The cops
know where you are?</i>

23:15.853 --> 23:17.435
<i>Where... where the fuck are you?</i>

23:17.563 --> 23:22.934
I'm in a bathroom, man,
fucking nasty ass bathroom and it's grimy.

23:24.278 --> 23:29.194
<i>Fuck, man, can't believe
you fucking tried to call me.</i>

23:29.325 --> 23:31.533
<i>You realize they're
gonna trace this shit?</i>

23:31.660 --> 23:32.741
I need your help.

23:32.870 --> 23:35.283
<i>Listen, you're fucked.</i>

23:35.414 --> 23:37.656
<i>God can't even help you, man.</i>

23:37.791 --> 23:39.751
<i>You just bought
yourself like twenty years,</i>

23:39.793 --> 23:42.752
<i>and right now,
you're dragging me in it.</i>

23:42.880 --> 23:46.214
<i>I'm not gonna be in an
accessory to your dumb ass.</i>

23:46.342 --> 23:48.925
I know. I know, man.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.219
I just need to delay it.

23:52.348 --> 23:55.307
I just gotta keep those guys
on the other side of the door

23:55.434 --> 23:57.096
just a little longer.

23:58.062 --> 24:00.975
<i>Tell them you'll shootyourself
if they try to breach.</i>

24:01.106 --> 24:03.348
<i>Jesus, I'm in a lobby right now.</i>

24:03.484 --> 24:05.350
Yeah? And I'm in a
trucker's hell hole.

24:07.321 --> 24:10.109
But I can't tell them that,
I told them I got a hostage.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.607
<i>Are you
fucking out ofyour mind?</i>

24:12.743 --> 24:13.984
What?

24:14.119 --> 24:16.486
<i>Goddammit, I can't believe this.</i>

24:16.622 --> 24:18.989
<i>You are such an amateur,
you realize that?</i>

24:19.124 --> 24:21.867
Vern, I need your help.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.743
I don't need your
crap right now.

24:24.838 --> 24:26.454
- Just walk me through this.
<i>- Well...</i>

24:27.967 --> 24:31.005
<i>They're gonna wanna
talk to the hostage,</i>

24:31.136 --> 24:32.502
<i>otherwise they'll breach,</i>

24:32.638 --> 24:35.381
<i>especially since they
think you're dangerous.</i>

24:35.557 --> 24:37.344
- Goddammit.
<i>- Heat.</i>

24:37.476 --> 24:38.512
What?

24:39.478 --> 24:42.186
<i>Heat. They have
these heat cameras.</i>

24:42.314 --> 24:44.772
<i>They know the second
there's someone else in there.</i>

24:46.276 --> 24:47.276
All right.

24:48.278 --> 24:49.689
I got this covered, thank you.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.030
- <i>Don't call me again!</i>
- Talk to you later.

25:09.717 --> 25:10.924
<i>Can we go back?</i>

25:14.471 --> 25:17.964
<i>Cross out the punishment
of years scratched into our hearts?</i>

25:19.852 --> 25:21.434
<i>Are we still alive here?</i>

25:25.149 --> 25:27.641
<i>An arrow cannot
change its course.</i>

25:33.699 --> 25:37.864
<i>Like our very birth,
do we have no choice in this?</i>

25:43.792 --> 25:46.079
<i>Are we the consequence
of ourselves?</i>

26:41.642 --> 26:42.642
<i>Aaron!</i>

26:42.643 --> 26:45.807
Laura, baby, you gotta
listen to me. Okay?

26:45.938 --> 26:48.305
<i>Aaron, what the hell
is going on right now?</i>

26:48.440 --> 26:50.853
Please baby, I don't
have a lot of time, okay?

26:50.984 --> 26:52.796
- I want you to focus on...
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>

26:52.820 --> 26:55.590
<i>Will you shut up for a second! What do
you mean you don't have a lot of time?</i>

26:55.614 --> 26:57.651
<i>What the hell does that mean?</i>

26:57.783 --> 27:00.220
I know you have a lot of questions,
and I'll answer them, baby.

27:00.244 --> 27:03.328
- I promise. I promise.
<i>- No, no, no, goddammit.</i>

27:03.455 --> 27:05.295
<i>No, Aaron, I'm not gonna
be able to do anything</i>

27:05.374 --> 27:07.310
<i>until you tell me what the
hell is going on right now.</i>

27:07.334 --> 27:09.200
Laura, we don't
have time for this.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.168
<i>You said you killed somebody.</i>

27:12.840 --> 27:14.251
<i>You said you were hurt!</i>

27:19.429 --> 27:20.429
<i>Aaron?</i>

27:25.269 --> 27:27.761
<i>Ifyou hung up on me
again, I swear to God...</i>

27:30.607 --> 27:32.223
Elijah and I were
gonna do a job.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.572
<i>You're with my
fucking brother right now?</i>

27:35.696 --> 27:36.696
<i>Give him the phone?</i>

27:36.822 --> 27:38.939
- Laura...
<i>- Give him the phone, Aaron.</i>

27:39.074 --> 27:41.157
<i>- I wanna talk to my brother.</i>
- He's not here.

27:41.285 --> 27:42.565
<i>What do you mean he's not there?</i>

27:43.495 --> 27:45.578
<i>- He ditched you?</i>
- No, it's not like that.

27:45.706 --> 27:47.851
<i>Yeah, of course he did, 'cause
that's what he does, Aaron,</i>

27:47.875 --> 27:49.082
<i>'cause he's a fuck-up.</i>

27:49.209 --> 27:50.575
<i>I love him to death, but he is.</i>

27:50.711 --> 27:53.328
<i>And hejumps ship at the sign
of any sight of trouble.</i>

27:53.463 --> 27:56.025
<i>I mean, why do you think I told you not
to get mixed up in his bullshit?</i>

27:56.049 --> 27:57.585
I told you it's not like that.

27:57.718 --> 27:59.960
<i>God, this is gonna break
my mom's heart.</i>

28:00.095 --> 28:01.552
<i>What the hell did he
getyou into?</i>

28:01.680 --> 28:03.842
- We need the money, it was...
<i>- Oh, my God!</i>

28:03.974 --> 28:06.261
<i>You did not kill
someone for money?</i>

28:06.393 --> 28:08.180
No, of course not,
it's not like that.

28:08.312 --> 28:10.512
<i>What the hell
did Elijah drag you into?</i>

28:10.564 --> 28:11.564
I went to him!

28:14.193 --> 28:16.560
It was supposed to be
a quick in and out.

28:19.448 --> 28:22.282
<i>Wait, what are you saying?
Whatyou've robbed a guy?</i>

28:22.409 --> 28:25.573
Laura, we can make sense
of this later, but right now...

28:25.704 --> 28:27.787
<i>- I want to know right now.</i>
- I need your help.

28:27.915 --> 28:29.795
<i>- None of this makes any sense, Aaron!</i>
- Please!

28:32.085 --> 28:33.085
Please.

28:34.796 --> 28:37.163
I need you to help me.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.587
<i>Okay.</i>

28:42.804 --> 28:43.804
<i>Okay.</i>

28:46.558 --> 28:47.674
Okay.

28:49.019 --> 28:54.731
Now, baby, I need you
to sound like you're scared.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.559
<i>Scared?</i>

28:57.694 --> 29:00.732
Like, I need you
to sound like a hostage.

29:01.657 --> 29:04.491
<i>Aaron, is this ajoke? You want
me to sound like a hostage?</i>

29:04.618 --> 29:06.154
Trust me baby, please, okay?

29:06.286 --> 29:09.620
I need you to say,
"I'm here, I'm okay."

29:11.208 --> 29:13.248
<i>Aaron, I don't understand
what's going on right now.</i>

29:14.044 --> 29:15.376
Just say it, just...

29:15.504 --> 29:19.544
Just say it just like this,
say, "I'm here, I'm okay."

29:21.051 --> 29:23.088
<i>I'm here, I'm okay.</i>

29:27.891 --> 29:29.632
Okay. Good.

29:31.687 --> 29:34.020
But I... I need it
to sound more real.

29:35.357 --> 29:36.357
Do you know what I mean?

29:37.693 --> 29:41.027
<i>I'm here for you, okay?
I am okay, and I'm here for you.</i>

29:41.154 --> 29:42.190
No, no, no, no.

29:43.699 --> 29:45.531
It's not about me.

29:45.659 --> 29:48.527
I need you to sound
like you're scared.

29:50.038 --> 29:53.952
I need you to sound like you're
stuck and like you're scared.

29:55.502 --> 29:56.502
Please.

29:58.922 --> 29:59.958
I need this.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.632
I need this bad, baby.
Please do this for me.

30:04.636 --> 30:05.672
Please.

30:08.432 --> 30:11.345
<i>I'm here, I'm okay.</i>

30:13.020 --> 30:14.056
Good.

30:14.187 --> 30:15.894
<i>I'm here, I'm okay.</i>

30:16.023 --> 30:17.023
Louder, Laura.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.106
<i>I'm here, I'm okay!</i>

30:19.234 --> 30:23.899
- Again.
<i>- I'm here, I'm okay!</i>

30:24.031 --> 30:26.364
- Again!
<i>- I'm here, I'm okay!</i>

30:26.491 --> 30:28.824
- Say it!
<i>- I'm here, I'm okay!</i>

30:28.952 --> 30:30.739
<i>I'm here, I'm okay!</i>

30:30.912 --> 30:33.199
<i>Why are you making me do this?</i>

30:42.049 --> 30:43.756
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

30:43.884 --> 30:46.171
I need to talk
with Lieutenant Koch right now.

30:46.303 --> 30:48.044
Lieutenant Arnold Koch.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.408
<i>You need to call the station
directly sir, this line is for...</i>

30:50.432 --> 30:54.972
No, no! Damn it. I'm the guy.
I'm the guy in the bathroom.

30:55.103 --> 30:56.719
<i>You sayyou're in a bathroom?</i>

30:56.855 --> 30:58.847
Yeah. Whatever, the standoff,

30:58.982 --> 31:01.144
I need to talk
with Lieutenant Koch.

31:01.276 --> 31:04.644
So, transfer me, patch me through,
do whatever you gotta do, okay?

31:04.780 --> 31:06.112
I gotta talk with him right now!

31:06.239 --> 31:08.151
Tell him it's Mitch,
I've got a hostage...

31:08.283 --> 31:10.650
Damn it, lady!
I'm the guy in the bathroom!

31:10.786 --> 31:12.823
Okay? Get me Koch now!

31:14.289 --> 31:15.289
<i>Hold please.</i>

31:27.219 --> 31:28.255
<i>Mitch?</i>

31:28.387 --> 31:30.049
I told you to give me time.

31:31.181 --> 31:33.798
I told you to back off.

31:33.975 --> 31:35.661
<i>We need to hear
from your girlfriend...</i>

31:35.685 --> 31:39.599
<i>I'm here, I'm okay!
I'm here, I'm okay!</i>

31:39.731 --> 31:41.768
<i>Why are you making me do this?</i>

31:44.277 --> 31:45.277
You heard her.

31:46.196 --> 31:49.735
She's here, she's okay.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.448
I haven't touched her.

31:51.576 --> 31:54.319
<i>Okay, Mitch, that's...
that's good. Thank you.</i>

31:54.454 --> 31:56.241
Now, back off, Koch.

31:56.373 --> 32:00.208
I'm trying to sort shit out on my end,
and I don't like you stepping.

32:00.335 --> 32:01.997
<i>Now, Mitch, you
know that we can't...</i>

35:33.673 --> 35:34.914
Hey.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.050
<i>Hey.</i>

35:36.760 --> 35:37.760
What's up?

35:37.886 --> 35:39.923
<i>Bad fucking news, man.</i>

35:41.306 --> 35:44.140
What is it? SWAT?

35:44.267 --> 35:48.557
<i>Yeah. These guys, like
normal cops, just roll up.</i>

35:48.688 --> 35:50.368
<i>They're pulling gear
out of the truck, man.</i>

35:51.483 --> 35:54.521
<i>Now, on TV they always
got these big ass tanks,</i>

35:54.653 --> 35:55.838
<i>who are wearing like bad asses,</i>

35:55.862 --> 35:59.071
<i>but no, no, these guys, they
just look like high school cops.</i>

35:59.199 --> 36:00.940
What else is going on out there?

36:01.076 --> 36:03.693
<i>Uh... Helicopter has
been buzzing around.</i>

36:03.828 --> 36:04.828
Uh-huh.

36:05.955 --> 36:11.326
<i>There is a dog, no news crews
or anything, I mean, not from where I am.</i>

36:13.546 --> 36:15.253
Oh, where are you?

36:16.549 --> 36:19.212
<i>Like five hundred feet
away in a parking lot.</i>

36:21.971 --> 36:26.682
Sam, do you see a guy in charge

36:26.810 --> 36:30.053
or a guy who looks
like he's in charge?

36:30.188 --> 36:32.748
<i>I've seen two guys who look like
they're calling the shots.</i>

36:37.529 --> 36:39.382
Do you think the SWAT team
is gonna come get me?

36:39.406 --> 36:40.406
<i>No doubt.</i>

36:41.199 --> 36:42.315
<i>I called to check on you.</i>

36:42.450 --> 36:43.486
I'm okay.

36:43.618 --> 36:44.535
<i>Bullshit.</i>

36:44.536 --> 36:46.296
<i>Right now, you need to
tell me the game plan.</i>

36:48.957 --> 36:51.415
Look, man, I don't
have a plan, all right?

36:52.335 --> 36:54.577
I gotta come up with something.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.249
<i>Aaron, come on!</i>

36:56.381 --> 36:58.464
<i>Dude, just come on,
just put the gun down,</i>

36:58.591 --> 37:01.334
<i>kick the shit to the side,
just walk out of here alive.</i>

37:01.469 --> 37:03.085
<i>Hold your hands
up and walk out.</i>

37:03.221 --> 37:04.837
I want to, Sam, okay?

37:04.973 --> 37:06.617
Believe me, I do,
but it's not that simple...

37:06.641 --> 37:09.884
<i>Cut the shit, Aaron. Listen goddammit,
you got a shit hand dealt to you right now,</i>

37:10.019 --> 37:12.386
<i>but it's fucking better
than getting killed.</i>

37:12.522 --> 37:16.141
<i>It's bad luck, I know,
butyou can get out of this.</i>

37:16.276 --> 37:18.438
<i>I mean, what about me, asshole?</i>

37:18.570 --> 37:20.857
<i>What about Laura, you're
gonna walk away from that?</i>

37:20.989 --> 37:22.946
<i>I mean, this is stupid.</i>

37:23.074 --> 37:24.074
No.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.692
<i>Look the longer this goes on,
the more likely the cops kill you.</i>

37:26.828 --> 37:29.161
No, you don't get it.

37:29.330 --> 37:30.330
<i>What don't I get?</i>

37:32.584 --> 37:33.620
<i>What don't I get?</i>

37:33.752 --> 37:35.835
I know
what the score is.

37:35.962 --> 37:38.124
I know this basically
means I'm a goner.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.543
- <i>No, no, no, no.</i>
- It's for her.

37:42.135 --> 37:45.719
These rocks, I gotta
get them to her.

37:45.847 --> 37:48.214
<i>- You gotta think aboutyou!</i>
- I'm going in!

37:49.684 --> 37:50.684
Forever!

37:52.145 --> 37:55.684
I can't be thinking about me,
she's gotta be taken care of!

37:57.734 --> 38:00.898
That's why me and Elijah did it
in the first place, for Laura.

38:04.574 --> 38:06.281
So, I can't give up to the cops.

38:07.702 --> 38:10.194
That's why I can't
surrender! Not now!

38:15.835 --> 38:17.701
I need more time.

38:19.589 --> 38:21.455
<i>For what exactly?</i>

38:23.968 --> 38:25.049
To hide the shit.

38:27.055 --> 38:28.055
I need...

38:30.558 --> 38:32.174
I need to get it to you.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.310
<i>Oh, hell no.</i>

38:33.353 --> 38:39.224
Listen, man, if I can stash it
or get it to you or to Vern,

38:40.652 --> 38:41.733
you can get it to Laura.

38:42.904 --> 38:46.022
I can't provide for her
if I'm locked away.

38:47.116 --> 38:50.109
<i>You... Oh, do you wanna hold up
the cops while you bury your treasure?</i>

38:50.245 --> 38:51.702
Yeah.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.662
<i>Christ on a cracker.</i>

38:53.790 --> 38:55.201
Oh, you got a better idea?

38:57.335 --> 38:59.122
<i>Yeah, give up.</i>

39:00.421 --> 39:03.038
<i>It doesn't seem like you're
gonna hear me out on that.</i>

39:03.174 --> 39:04.174
No.

39:05.802 --> 39:06.802
Listen, just...

39:07.762 --> 39:09.682
just give me some time
to come up with something.

39:10.640 --> 39:11.640
<i>Right.</i>

39:13.059 --> 39:14.059
Thanks, pal.

40:06.821 --> 40:08.778
<i>Hey, it's Vern, sorry...</i>

40:12.160 --> 40:13.076
<i>What?</i>

40:13.077 --> 40:15.865
- Sam and I are working on a...
<i>- You called Sam?</i>

40:15.997 --> 40:18.455
...working on a plan
to get the rocks to you.

40:18.583 --> 40:19.664
<i>I'm hanging up.</i>

40:19.792 --> 40:21.078
If you hang up,

40:21.210 --> 40:24.499
I swear to God I will have
Sam show up at your place

40:24.631 --> 40:26.497
and beat you to death, Vern.

40:26.633 --> 40:28.499
<i>Oh, that's very scary.</i>

40:28.635 --> 40:32.595
<i>Listen, you fucking ruined
my movie, you're a dick.</i>

40:32.722 --> 40:35.135
I'm getting Sam the rocks.
How quick can you turn it around?

40:35.266 --> 40:36.928
The cops will be hard to try it.

40:37.060 --> 40:38.346
<i>This shit takes time.</i>

40:38.519 --> 40:40.556
<i>Next time, don't
fuck up the job.</i>

40:41.731 --> 40:43.017
<i>Why did you call Sam?</i>

40:43.149 --> 40:46.187
<i>Why not Elijah, this shit
is for his sister, isn't it?</i>

40:46.319 --> 40:51.314
How quickly can you get
it turned around, Vern?

40:51.449 --> 40:54.032
<i>Maybe forty-eight hours.</i>

40:55.703 --> 40:57.285
And you can get
the money to Laura?

40:57.413 --> 40:59.780
<i>Yeah, but I'm taking
a bigger cut.</i>

41:00.708 --> 41:01.708
Fine.

41:08.549 --> 41:09.549
Start setting it up.

41:09.634 --> 41:12.251
Sam will get you the goods,
do not fuck this up for me.

41:31.990 --> 41:32.990
Fuck!

41:36.285 --> 41:38.402
<i>Was ityou
to set this in motion?</i>

41:45.670 --> 41:48.208
<i>Was ityour hand
guiding us in this life?</i>

41:52.051 --> 41:53.167
What are you doing?

42:02.020 --> 42:05.138
<i>Was ityour stone
cast to cause these ripples?</i>

42:10.862 --> 42:12.444
<i>Did you choose this?</i>

42:12.613 --> 42:15.196
I'll kill you!

42:21.956 --> 42:23.197
Can you hear me?

42:27.879 --> 42:29.586
Fucking cop!

42:33.301 --> 42:34.758
<i>Oh God!</i>

42:56.365 --> 42:58.152
- Yeah.
<i>- Hello, Aaron.</i>

42:59.410 --> 43:04.656
It's taken you
longer than I expected.

43:06.751 --> 43:10.836
<i>Aaron, I think you should know
the Sheriff's Department is here.</i>

43:10.963 --> 43:11.982
<i>They wanna speak with you.</i>

43:14.217 --> 43:15.503
Fuck you.

43:16.928 --> 43:19.386
You're talking with me.

43:19.514 --> 43:20.755
<i>I'd love to talk to you.</i>

43:20.890 --> 43:23.610
<i>I'd love to listen to you, Aaron,
but you haven't been talking to me.</i>

43:23.643 --> 43:26.181
Oh, fuck.

43:26.312 --> 43:29.851
Aaron, you know my name.

43:31.067 --> 43:32.774
You traced my number.

43:32.902 --> 43:37.146
<i>Calling was the smart idea,
it was a good thing to do.</i>

43:39.450 --> 43:44.286
<i>Aaron, can you tell me
ifyour girlfriend is okay?</i>

43:45.540 --> 43:47.122
Fuck you, Koch.

43:48.042 --> 43:53.208
You're trying to get someone
killed in here, aren't you?

43:53.339 --> 43:55.877
<i>Aaron, there was
an incident up the road.</i>

43:56.008 --> 43:57.340
<i>You know anything about that?</i>

43:58.845 --> 44:00.427
Yeah.

44:00.555 --> 44:01.636
<i>Will you tell me about it?</i>

44:02.849 --> 44:05.762
My lungs are on fire.

44:07.436 --> 44:12.477
If you wanna talk with me,
don't gas me, dick.

44:14.026 --> 44:17.815
She's fine, we'll be okay.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.112
Don't try that shit again.

44:24.704 --> 44:25.704
Get it?

44:37.049 --> 44:38.585
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

44:44.932 --> 44:45.932
<i>Aaron?</i>

44:51.981 --> 44:53.097
<i>I'm here.</i>

44:58.112 --> 45:00.195
<i>Now breathe.</i>

48:35.079 --> 48:40.325
I will give you half
the take for one drop.

49:33.637 --> 49:36.675
<i>I am the world's
best friend, you know that?</i>

49:36.807 --> 49:37.724
What did you do?

49:37.725 --> 49:40.593
<i>The woods, man,
near the bathroom,</i>

49:41.604 --> 49:43.641
<i>on the other side from the cops?</i>

49:43.772 --> 49:48.358
Like... the woods, the trees?

49:48.486 --> 49:51.399
<i>Yeah, the woods.</i>

49:51.530 --> 49:53.112
<i>Yeah, the woods, you know?</i>

49:53.240 --> 49:54.447
<i>Cops are in the parking lot,</i>

49:54.575 --> 49:56.908
<i>and then the road,
there's like the road.</i>

49:57.077 --> 49:59.740
<i>But on the other side
there's like a ditch, man.</i>

49:59.872 --> 50:01.738
Sam, Sam!

50:01.874 --> 50:03.866
<i>Yeah, it's like
ten feet or so, man.</i>

50:04.001 --> 50:06.914
<i>There's a big ditch
and then a bunch of trees.</i>

50:07.087 --> 50:09.579
Damn it, man!

50:09.715 --> 50:10.995
I can't fit through that window.

50:11.050 --> 50:14.339
It's too small, that'll be too slow,
they'll grab me in a second.

50:14.470 --> 50:18.305
<i>You? Hmm, not...
notyou, screw you.</i>

50:18.432 --> 50:20.048
<i>You're going to jail.</i>

50:20.184 --> 50:22.392
Well, thanks,
world's best friend.

50:22.520 --> 50:24.011
<i>Well, dude the jewels.</i>

50:24.146 --> 50:26.583
<i>The jewels, man, toss them out
the window, I can pick them up,</i>

50:26.607 --> 50:28.849
<i>and, you know, I'll
slip in real quiet like.</i>

50:28.984 --> 50:30.441
No, Sam...

50:30.569 --> 50:32.185
<i>For fuck's sake, Aaron!</i>

50:32.321 --> 50:33.812
But they'll
spot you, dude.

50:33.948 --> 50:38.067
<i>Then make a big ass
distraction for me, would you?</i>

50:38.202 --> 50:39.864
<i>Toss that shit
through the window,</i>

50:39.995 --> 50:41.156
<i>I'll be waiting in the trees,</i>

50:41.288 --> 50:43.200
<i>when the coast
is clear, I'll snag it.</i>

50:44.458 --> 50:46.074
And it goes to Laura, okay?

50:46.210 --> 50:48.748
<i>Well, Elijah gets
his cut, so does Vern,</i>

50:48.879 --> 50:51.667
<i>and so do I, fucker,
'cause I'm dodging cops too.</i>

50:51.799 --> 50:53.381
Okay, and the rest goes to her.

50:54.301 --> 50:57.669
By the way, Vern's been a dick,
so don't let him get handsy with his cut.

50:57.805 --> 50:59.421
<i>I gotyou, dog.</i>

50:59.557 --> 51:00.557
Do what you gotta do.

51:12.695 --> 51:13.902
Hey.

51:14.029 --> 51:15.986
<i>I called Elijah,
but he isn't answering,</i>

51:16.156 --> 51:18.899
<i>so... I called Sam.</i>

51:23.289 --> 51:24.871
<i>Aaron, are you there?</i>

51:27.167 --> 51:30.410
Yeah, I... of course.

51:32.423 --> 51:33.664
You talked to Sam?

51:36.093 --> 51:37.093
<i>Yeah.</i>

51:39.471 --> 51:40.587
He didn't mention that.

51:41.890 --> 51:44.598
<i>He said thatyou're surrounded
by the police right now.</i>

51:44.727 --> 51:46.810
No, no, baby, baby, I'm almost...

51:46.937 --> 51:48.053
<i>I can't do this.</i>

51:49.565 --> 51:51.682
No, no, no, it's fine.
Sam and I are...

51:51.817 --> 51:54.810
<i>I can't do this, Aaron!
I can't do this!</i>

51:54.945 --> 51:58.188
<i>I can't sit around waiting
foryou for my entire life.</i>

51:58.324 --> 51:59.282
No.

51:59.283 --> 52:00.443
<i>I don't wantyour blood money.</i>

52:00.492 --> 52:01.572
<i>Did that ever occur to you?</i>

52:01.660 --> 52:04.323
<i>Did it cross your mind that I don't wanna
sit around and pay bills</i>

52:04.455 --> 52:07.619
<i>with blood money while you rot away
in prison for the rest ofyour life?</i>

52:10.919 --> 52:12.319
You're kidding
me right now?

52:12.421 --> 52:13.982
<i>Do I sound like
I'm fucking kidding?</i>

52:14.006 --> 52:15.838
I've gone through hell for you.

52:15.966 --> 52:19.175
Sam is outside right now putting
his life on the line for you.

52:19.303 --> 52:20.794
<i>I don't give a hot
fuck about Sam!</i>

52:20.929 --> 52:23.637
<i>I don't care about Elijah,
I don't care about Sam,</i>

52:23.766 --> 52:24.973
<i>I care about you, Aaron!</i>

52:26.644 --> 52:29.387
<i>And I can't live with this money knowing
what you did to get it.</i>

52:36.904 --> 52:40.397
Laura... I'm sick of it.

52:43.035 --> 52:47.496
My back is breaking,
my knees have gone to hell.

52:50.042 --> 52:54.628
I am sick of digging holes
for fence posts and stacking boxes,

52:55.756 --> 53:00.000
scraping by at eight bucks
an hour at a grindy-ass job.

53:03.555 --> 53:04.887
Laura, I want a life.

53:08.560 --> 53:09.801
I want a house with you.

53:12.064 --> 53:14.772
I wanna drive a car
not ride a bike.

53:17.569 --> 53:19.060
Laura, I wanna sleep in.

53:22.199 --> 53:24.862
I wanna wake up every
morning and see you there.

53:27.830 --> 53:30.368
I wanna give you the life
you should've had.

53:34.253 --> 53:36.370
I gave you everything I am,

53:36.505 --> 53:39.464
and it cost me everything I
could've been, but that's okay.

53:43.303 --> 53:44.669
Because you will go on

53:46.098 --> 53:48.681
and at least I will know,

53:51.311 --> 53:53.769
at least in quiet minutes,

53:55.899 --> 53:57.561
that you're gonna be okay.

54:05.492 --> 54:06.492
<i>Okay.</i>

54:15.169 --> 54:16.169
I gotta go.

54:19.381 --> 54:20.381
<i>Okay.</i>

54:21.800 --> 54:22.800
I love you.

54:24.261 --> 54:25.718
<i>Promise you'll call back.</i>

54:28.140 --> 54:29.140
I love you.

54:36.190 --> 54:37.190
<i>Aaron.</i>

54:39.276 --> 54:40.276
Yeah.

54:41.028 --> 54:42.028
<i>You feeling okay?</i>

54:43.405 --> 54:45.488
Not even close, Mr. Koch.

54:46.450 --> 54:47.657
<i>Is your girlfriend there?</i>

54:48.660 --> 54:50.322
<i>Why don'tyou tell us her name?</i>

54:50.454 --> 54:52.446
Jesus, man, you're relentless.

54:55.334 --> 54:56.334
Laura.

54:57.419 --> 54:59.285
Her name is Laura.

54:59.421 --> 55:03.165
<i>The Sheriff's guys want me to ask you
about that incident up the road.</i>

55:04.593 --> 55:06.926
I'm sure you have it
very well figured out.

55:07.054 --> 55:11.298
<i>Look, I'm sure you must feel like we're trying
to set a trap foryou, but the truth is...</i>

55:11.433 --> 55:12.799
You gassed me, bro.

55:13.852 --> 55:15.514
We're not friends right now.

55:16.480 --> 55:19.223
<i>Aaron, if we cannot
confirm that Laura is okay,</i>

55:19.358 --> 55:21.224
<i>these deputies are
coming through the door.</i>

55:21.360 --> 55:24.023
<i>We need reassurances.</i>

55:24.154 --> 55:27.113
Shit.

55:30.869 --> 55:33.202
Let me tell you how
this is gonna work.

55:33.330 --> 55:35.322
You're gonna back the fuck off

55:35.457 --> 55:37.244
or I'm coming out shooting.

55:38.377 --> 55:42.417
<i>Aaron, you sound to me like a real smart guy
who ran into some real bad luck.</i>

55:44.216 --> 55:46.173
Like you give a damn.

55:46.301 --> 55:51.387
<i>I do. Look, it's my job to make sure
we all walk away from this alive.</i>

55:52.474 --> 55:54.932
<i>Now, please give me something
to ease these guys up.</i>

55:55.060 --> 55:57.268
Piss off.

55:57.396 --> 55:58.853
<i>Do you care about her?</i>

56:00.107 --> 56:01.143
<i>Uhm? Aaron?</i>

56:02.776 --> 56:04.358
<i>Don'tyou wanna see her safe?</i>

56:06.697 --> 56:07.697
Yes.

56:07.698 --> 56:09.109
<i>Then let her go.</i>

56:10.367 --> 56:11.778
- I can't do that.
<i>- Why not, Aaron?</i>

56:11.910 --> 56:15.449
I don't know. I don't know.

56:15.581 --> 56:17.868
<i>Aaron, ifyou don't
give me something,</i>

56:18.000 --> 56:20.162
<i>ifyou don't give
me something now,</i>

56:20.294 --> 56:22.627
<i>they'll breach,
they'll come in there.</i>

56:22.754 --> 56:24.290
<i>I'm doing my best to help you.</i>

56:26.550 --> 56:28.086
How is he?

56:28.218 --> 56:29.675
<i>Excuse me?</i>

56:29.803 --> 56:32.921
The cop, how is he?

56:33.056 --> 56:34.056
<i>Who?</i>

56:34.892 --> 56:36.133
The guy I shot.

56:38.020 --> 56:39.386
It's...

56:41.773 --> 56:42.809
Did I kill him?

56:45.360 --> 56:46.360
What was his name?

56:50.657 --> 56:52.364
<i>He's absolutely fine.</i>

56:53.869 --> 56:55.110
What?

56:55.245 --> 56:56.781
<i>Yeah, he's okay, Aaron.</i>

56:58.624 --> 57:02.038
<i>You didn't hit him,
you missed, he's okay.</i>

57:07.633 --> 57:09.499
<i>You didn't kill anyone.</i>

57:11.219 --> 57:12.710
<i>It's okay to come out, Aaron.</i>

57:35.911 --> 57:40.497
Oh, God, please, please.

58:08.568 --> 58:10.810
<i>This world
wasn't made for you.</i>

58:23.583 --> 58:25.324
<i>It has dirt in its seams.</i>

58:29.423 --> 58:32.587
Come on.

58:32.718 --> 58:34.004
Come on.

58:37.472 --> 58:40.931
<i>It's too weathered to
live under a light like yours.</i>

59:01.997 --> 59:07.914
<i>Your soul...
clung to a dirty window.</i>

01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:29.643
Hello.

01:01:29.728 --> 01:01:30.728
<i>Aaron!</i>

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:33.934
<i>Jesus, I thought
something happened.</i>

01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:36.394
I'm sorry.

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:38.392
<i>I've been calling, man.</i>

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:40.611
Oh... Yeah.

01:01:41.573 --> 01:01:42.984
<i>I'm in position.</i>

01:01:43.116 --> 01:01:44.116
Huh?

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:45.783
<i>Outside.</i>

01:01:45.911 --> 01:01:48.951
<i>Just outside in the trees, the cops can't
see back here, they aren't looking.</i>

01:01:52.751 --> 01:01:53.751
<i>Dude, come on.</i>

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:00.582
I can't really see.

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:02.674
<i>I'm right here,
I'm right here, see me?</i>

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.712
No, I can't see.

01:02:05.847 --> 01:02:08.260
I don't see you.
I don't have a good vantage.

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:10.929
<i>Oh, scrooge. Toss me the money.</i>

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.061
Which way?

01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:13.389
<i>What?</i>

01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:14.762
Which way do I throw it?

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:18.482
<i>I'm just in front ofyou,
just in front ofyou.</i>

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:20.685
Give me a minute.

01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:27.616
There're cops everywhere,
man, this is stupid!

01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:29.531
<i>It'll work, just do it, come on.</i>

01:02:29.663 --> 01:02:31.746
- Fuck!
<i>- You just gotta be quick.</i>

01:02:37.963 --> 01:02:39.204
<i>Aaron.</i>

01:02:39.339 --> 01:02:40.699
Okay,
let me try something.

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:48.463
<i>You need to hurry, man, I don't
think I could be here that long.</i>

01:02:56.231 --> 01:02:59.724
<i>Dude, what are you doing?
Stop messing around, hustle up.</i>

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:05.396
- I think I see you.
<i>- Okay, finally.</i>

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:08.611
<i>Throw me the bag.</i>

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:21.171
<i>Aaron.</i>

01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:25.169
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

01:03:30.724 --> 01:03:32.056
<i>What happened?</i>

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:39.013
<i>Aaron?</i>

01:04:59.646 --> 01:05:00.646
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:10.656
<i>Aaron?</i>

01:05:13.451 --> 01:05:14.451
<i>I'm here.</i>

01:05:17.038 --> 01:05:20.952
What?

01:05:21.084 --> 01:05:22.084
<i>Hello?</i>

01:05:27.632 --> 01:05:28.632
<i>Aaron?</i>

01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:33.426
I fell down.

01:05:33.555 --> 01:05:35.012
<i>Can you call for help?</i>

01:05:36.057 --> 01:05:38.174
<i>- Can I?</i>
- No.

01:05:39.727 --> 01:05:41.889
<i>Where are you hurt, Aaron?</i>

01:05:43.648 --> 01:05:45.480
<i>Can you tell me where you're hurt?</i>

01:05:54.534 --> 01:05:56.617
I feel lit at my teeth.

01:05:56.744 --> 01:05:58.076
<i>Oh, my God, baby.</i>

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:03.240
I can't... I can't...

01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:06.335
<i>Stop, hey, hey, just take...
take a deep breath, okay?</i>

01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:07.749
<i>Just take a deep breath, Aaron.</i>

01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:10.048
<i>Come on.</i>

01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:13.338
<i>Okay, good.</i>

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:14.631
<i>Good, good.</i>

01:06:14.762 --> 01:06:17.675
<i>Now, nowjust listen to
the sound of my voice, okay?</i>

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:18.968
<i>Just listen to me.</i>

01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:22.058
<i>All right? You're fine.</i>

01:06:27.192 --> 01:06:29.024
Now, breathe.

01:06:38.745 --> 01:06:41.237
It's okay, it's okay.

01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:45.574
I'm so sorry.

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:47.497
No, you're okay.

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:03.683
I told you I'd be right here.

01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:09.019
I don't know what to do.

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:16.484
You're too good.

01:07:18.326 --> 01:07:20.659
I never earned it.

01:07:26.668 --> 01:07:28.125
I don't deserve you.

01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:35.591
Tell me why.

01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:39.052
For us.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:41.847
No.

01:07:46.354 --> 01:07:47.811
There wasn't a choice.

01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:50.898
Is this your fate?

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:54.109
That you have no choice?

01:07:57.031 --> 01:07:58.272
I love you.

01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:05.620
Tell me why.

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:17.925
- My sister, Laura.
- Hey.

01:08:24.684 --> 01:08:26.175
Stop it, go away.

01:09:13.441 --> 01:09:15.228
Did you do it?

01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:17.651
You did it!

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:21.961
For us.

01:10:27.598 --> 01:10:29.055
I love you.

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:32.894
I love you.

01:11:05.386 --> 01:11:06.386
I gotta go.

01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:45.336
Oh, no, damn it.

01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:53.845
Damn it. Come on,
don't do this to me.

01:12:52.285 --> 01:12:54.777
<i>Why should the universe
arrange itself for you?</i>

01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:07.582
<i>You... one of many,</i>

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:12.343
<i>no more or less than the other.</i>

01:13:14.307 --> 01:13:18.051
<i>What is a single tear
in a life of sorrow?</i>

01:13:19.437 --> 01:13:20.437
<i>A joy?</i>

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:26.233
<i>Is it destiny
that rearranges us,</i>

01:13:28.654 --> 01:13:30.361
<i>that forces us together?</i>

01:13:33.117 --> 01:13:35.154
<i>Through this chaos
are we shaped,</i>

01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:38.495
<i>is it chance?</i>

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:41.416
<i>Choice?</i>

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:46.922
<i>Faith?</i>

01:13:53.387 --> 01:13:54.753
Hello.

01:13:54.889 --> 01:13:57.256
<i>What did you say
happened to Elijah?</i>

01:13:58.184 --> 01:13:59.184
Vern.

01:14:00.061 --> 01:14:01.927
<i>Ijust tried calling him.</i>

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:05.559
What?

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:09.651
<i>Elijah, I tried calling him.</i>

01:14:10.696 --> 01:14:12.938
- Vern...
<i>- Fuckyou, Aaron.</i>

01:14:13.074 --> 01:14:16.442
<i>You know who picked up?
The cops.</i>

01:14:16.577 --> 01:14:18.068
No, it's... it's not like that.

01:14:18.204 --> 01:14:21.914
<i>You left him, didn'tyou?
You left him behind.</i>

01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:22.958
No.

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:23.995
<i>Yes, you did.</i>

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:25.867
<i>No wonder they
were on your trail,</i>

01:14:26.003 --> 01:14:28.245
<i>you grabbed the goods
and you bailed on Elijah,</i>

01:14:28.381 --> 01:14:32.000
<i>and that's what you meant when you said,
"We got separated," you piece of shit.</i>

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:34.251
- Vern.
<i>- You ditched him, didn'tyou?</i>

01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:37.596
You don't understand. I tried
telling you, things went south.

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:39.965
<i>You're a fucking coward.</i>

01:14:40.101 --> 01:14:41.967
Vern, I can explain it to you.

01:14:42.103 --> 01:14:45.016
<i>Fuck you! I'm not helping you.</i>

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:46.308
It's not for me, it's...

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:49.023
<i>I can't believe you'd fucking
do that to Elijah, man.</i>

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:54.237
<i>I hope they nail you to a cross,
you spineless piece of shit.</i>

01:14:54.365 --> 01:14:55.446
Please.

01:14:57.243 --> 01:14:58.243
Fuck!

01:14:59.912 --> 01:15:01.232
We got
someone over here.

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:03.071
Freeze, Sheriff's Department.

01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:05.018
- Aaron!
- Sheriff's Department!

01:15:05.042 --> 01:15:07.104
Sheriff's Department,
get down on the ground.

01:15:07.128 --> 01:15:08.585
Sheriff's Department!

01:15:10.047 --> 01:15:11.254
Stop resisting.

01:15:11.382 --> 01:15:12.298
Sam.

01:15:12.299 --> 01:15:13.506
Yo, Aaron, Aaron!

01:15:13.634 --> 01:15:15.862
- Sam!
- Get down, get down on the floor right now.

01:15:15.886 --> 01:15:16.886
Knock down the door.

01:15:20.391 --> 01:15:21.391
Hurry!

01:15:21.475 --> 01:15:24.513
- Let me see your hands.
- Let me go, dude.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:39.534
Sam!

01:16:05.144 --> 01:16:06.144
Hello.

01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:07.932
<i>Aaron.</i>

01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:09.064
Sam!

01:16:09.857 --> 01:16:11.189
<i>I'm sorry, bro.</i>

01:16:11.317 --> 01:16:12.774
No, no, no.

01:16:13.694 --> 01:16:16.812
- No, it's... it's me, I should...
<i>- Aaron...</i>

01:16:20.326 --> 01:16:22.363
<i>It's time to come outside, man.</i>

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:28.244
<i>It's over.</i>

01:16:32.338 --> 01:16:33.624
Put him on.

01:16:33.756 --> 01:16:35.088
<i>Oh, please, buddy,
I'm asking you.</i>

01:16:35.216 --> 01:16:38.209
Sam, put him on.

01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:48.226
<i>Hello, Aaron.</i>

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:53.852
Let him go.

01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:57.231
<i>Your friend wants the same
thing we want, Aaron.</i>

01:16:57.363 --> 01:16:58.854
<i>I think it's time
to come out now.</i>

01:17:01.826 --> 01:17:03.488
<i>You haven't made
any demands all night.</i>

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:05.139
<i>You've keptyour head
on your shoulders.</i>

01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:07.989
I shot at one of your guys.

01:17:08.124 --> 01:17:09.309
<i>Butyou've been talking with me.</i>

01:17:15.756 --> 01:17:18.999
No, I can't do that.

01:17:23.097 --> 01:17:25.840
<i>Aaron, we know it's
justyou in there.</i>

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:32.397
What?

01:17:35.276 --> 01:17:37.438
<i>We knowyou've been
calling Laura all night.</i>

01:17:39.405 --> 01:17:40.862
<i>We know she's not in there.</i>

01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:53.659
You were looking
after your guys,

01:17:53.794 --> 01:17:55.554
that's why you haven't
tried to breach again.

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:59.122
<i>We're looking after you, Aaron.</i>

01:18:02.595 --> 01:18:03.927
Go easy on Sam.

01:18:11.145 --> 01:18:12.681
<i>Fuck off.</i>

01:18:12.813 --> 01:18:14.179
Please, Vern, don't hang up.

01:18:19.236 --> 01:18:20.772
It's not for me, it's for Laura.

01:18:20.905 --> 01:18:22.146
<i>It's absolutely for you.</i>

01:18:22.281 --> 01:18:24.819
Vern, the cops can come in
here any minute and kill me.

01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:27.112
<i>- Good!</i>
- Goddammit, Vern!

01:18:27.244 --> 01:18:30.783
In ten minutes, I'm gone for good, all right?
This isn't a fucking joke!

01:18:30.915 --> 01:18:33.783
<i>Oh, it's the biggest fucking
joke I've ever heard.</i>

01:18:33.918 --> 01:18:35.750
<i>You are, you are the joke.</i>

01:18:42.509 --> 01:18:44.466
If you don't help me out,
it was all for nothing.

01:18:47.014 --> 01:18:50.257
Vern, it was for nothing,
but you can make it worthwhile, okay?

01:18:50.392 --> 01:18:53.055
You can, right now, you can make
all of this worth something.

01:18:53.187 --> 01:18:55.349
<i>- It'll be a cold day in hell.</i>
- Goodman it.

01:18:55.481 --> 01:18:56.847
<i>What happened to Elijah?</i>

01:18:58.234 --> 01:18:59.475
<i>What happened to him?</i>

01:19:07.701 --> 01:19:08.987
You have to come here.

01:19:09.119 --> 01:19:12.453
After they take me away, you have
to come back here and get the money.

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:14.017
All right, I'll rope
it off or something...

01:19:14.041 --> 01:19:14.827
<i>Aaron!</i>

01:19:14.959 --> 01:19:20.421
Vern, me, Elijah, Sam,
we got it this far, okay?

01:19:20.547 --> 01:19:22.664
Right? And we're
counting on you.

01:19:22.841 --> 01:19:26.380
Laura, Laura is counting
on you, all right?

01:19:26.512 --> 01:19:30.381
This is why you're here, man,
it was... it was you all along.

01:19:30.516 --> 01:19:34.180
Right? It was you, you were
the last piece of the puzzle.

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:35.311
All right?

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:37.438
And I'm begging you.

01:19:38.983 --> 01:19:41.566
I'm begging you
right now, please.

01:19:41.694 --> 01:19:44.277
Vern, please, help me.

01:19:44.405 --> 01:19:45.521
Please, help Laura.

01:19:54.999 --> 01:19:58.367
No, no, no, I'll leave some
cash in the bag, all right.

01:19:58.502 --> 01:20:01.961
I'll throw them off the trail for a bit.
They'll think that's everything.

01:20:02.089 --> 01:20:05.423
By the time they realized I stashed
some stuff away, it'll be too late.

01:20:05.551 --> 01:20:06.962
You see?

01:20:07.094 --> 01:20:09.654
Now, you gotta be quick back here,
and you need to pick the rest.

01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:12.676
<i>Okay.</i>

01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:15.762
<i>Butyou have to tell me.</i>

01:20:27.698 --> 01:20:29.615
<i>Tell you what?</i>

01:20:29.616 --> 01:20:30.777
<i>The truth.</i>

01:20:33.871 --> 01:20:34.871
<i>Aaron.</i>

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:38.666
Yeah.

01:20:41.378 --> 01:20:42.378
I'm here.

01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:46.126
<i>Why did you leave Elijah behind?</i>

01:20:57.478 --> 01:20:58.514
He was shot.

01:22:26.233 --> 01:22:27.753
<i>I didn't think
you'd call back.</i>

01:22:30.279 --> 01:22:31.736
It won't be long now.

01:22:33.657 --> 01:22:35.193
<i>Please surrender, Aaron.</i>

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:43.865
I need to tell you something.

01:22:49.047 --> 01:22:50.047
<i>Okay.</i>

01:22:52.009 --> 01:22:53.250
Elijah.

01:22:57.431 --> 01:22:58.467
<i>What about him?</i>

01:23:06.523 --> 01:23:07.523
<i>Aaron?</i>

01:23:16.116 --> 01:23:17.357
<i>Aaron, what about him?</i>

01:23:22.873 --> 01:23:23.873
<i>Aaron!</i>

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:29.670
I'm here.

01:23:29.755 --> 01:23:30.871
<i>What about Elijah?</i>

01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:38.721
He's dead.

01:23:40.057 --> 01:23:41.057
<i>What?</i>

01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:44.721
<i>No, no...</i>

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:48.767
<i>No! Oh, my god.</i>

01:23:50.901 --> 01:23:52.392
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:23:54.196 --> 01:23:57.815
<i>No! No, no!</i>

01:23:59.243 --> 01:24:00.700
<i>No!</i>

01:24:00.827 --> 01:24:02.944
<i>No, no.</i>

01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:04.992
<i>I don't understand.</i>

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:08.533
I have to tell you, Laura.

01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:14.213
<i>No! I don't understand.</i>

01:24:14.341 --> 01:24:15.752
<i>What happened?</i>

01:24:18.428 --> 01:24:19.428
Laura.

01:24:20.847 --> 01:24:23.214
<i>Tell me what, Aaron,
what happened?</i>

01:24:27.312 --> 01:24:29.429
I wanted to tell you sooner.

01:24:29.565 --> 01:24:31.602
<i>Aaron, what happened?</i>

01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:40.156
<i>What happened? No...</i>

01:24:41.868 --> 01:24:43.325
<i>What happened?</i>

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:48.281
<i>Aaron, what happened?</i>

01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:51.660
On the ground everybody, down!

01:24:51.753 --> 01:24:54.587
- On the fucking ground!
- Get down on the floor.

01:24:54.715 --> 01:24:56.877
- Whoa, whoa.
- Get down on the fucking floor.

01:24:57.009 --> 01:24:59.422
Don't look at me,
stay on the ground.

01:24:59.553 --> 01:25:00.760
The drawers!

01:25:00.887 --> 01:25:02.365
- Alright, alright.
- Open the jewel cache.

01:25:02.389 --> 01:25:04.472
- Open your bag!
- Get back.

01:25:14.443 --> 01:25:15.795
Give me all
the cash you have.

01:25:15.819 --> 01:25:18.778
- That's it? That's it?
- Yeah.

01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:23.069
Son of a bitch.

01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:26.535
Eli, what the fuck
are you doing?

01:25:26.663 --> 01:25:28.655
What are you doing, bro?
Go get the stuff.

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:30.430
- Fuck, man. Don't...
- Go get it!

01:25:39.426 --> 01:25:42.919
Eli, I've got... Oh, God!

01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:14.618
Eli, no.

01:26:14.753 --> 01:26:15.789
No!

01:26:15.921 --> 01:26:17.082
- Eli!
- No!

01:26:17.255 --> 01:26:18.295
- Eli, don't!
- No!

01:26:18.382 --> 01:26:20.749
Eli!

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:54.208
Laura.

01:26:54.251 --> 01:26:56.664
<i>Aaron...</i>

01:26:58.213 --> 01:27:02.127
<i>What... What have you...</i>

01:27:02.259 --> 01:27:06.845
<i>Aaron, no. Aaron.</i>

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:09.759
<i>You killed him.</i>

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:14.644
<i>You killed him. Eli is not...</i>

01:27:14.771 --> 01:27:17.639
<i>You killed my brother?</i>

01:27:17.774 --> 01:27:19.015
Yes.

01:27:19.151 --> 01:27:22.861
<i>Why, why, why?</i>

01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:27.740
<i>- Why, why, why?</i>
- It was only to help.

01:27:27.868 --> 01:27:29.154
<i>He's gone.</i>

01:27:29.327 --> 01:27:31.159
It was only supposed to help.

01:27:31.288 --> 01:27:32.995
<i>Elijah's gone.</i>

01:27:36.418 --> 01:27:37.579
Laura...

01:27:39.421 --> 01:27:43.415
There is nothing I wouldn't
give to trade all this.

01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:45.462
<i>- You killed him.</i>
- I had to.

01:27:47.429 --> 01:27:50.922
You asked about destiny,
well, this is mine.

01:27:51.057 --> 01:27:55.142
<i>I didn't ask for this, Aaron,
I don't want this.</i>

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:58.138
And I'm giving up
my life for you,

01:28:00.066 --> 01:28:01.807
my freedom for you,

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:06.108
everything for you.

01:28:08.074 --> 01:28:11.317
I didn't want to either.
But I had to.

01:28:14.498 --> 01:28:18.117
I'd stop Elijah hundred times
if it meant protecting you.

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:21.128
Laura...

01:28:24.508 --> 01:28:26.090
I'd do it again if I had to.

01:28:27.010 --> 01:28:28.922
<i>I'm gonna be sick.</i>

01:28:31.598 --> 01:28:32.679
You have to take it.

01:28:34.017 --> 01:28:36.430
You have to take the money.

01:28:36.561 --> 01:28:37.893
<i>What? No!</i>

01:28:38.021 --> 01:28:39.728
<i>I can't think about it.</i>

01:28:39.856 --> 01:28:43.190
<i>No, not I'm not gonna
take it, I won't take it.</i>

01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:44.775
<i>- I don't want it.</i>
- You have to.

01:28:44.903 --> 01:28:46.235
<i>I can't...</i>

01:28:47.906 --> 01:28:51.741
<i>How, Aaron, how could you do
this and still sayyou love me?</i>

01:28:51.868 --> 01:28:52.984
<i>You don't love me.</i>

01:28:54.204 --> 01:28:55.445
<i>You don't love me.</i>

01:28:58.041 --> 01:28:59.953
<i>You don't love me.</i>

01:29:00.085 --> 01:29:01.417
I have nothing left to give.

01:29:04.756 --> 01:29:07.339
I have nothing left to give you.

01:29:07.467 --> 01:29:10.460
<i>And somehow you managed to
take everything away from me.</i>

01:29:12.264 --> 01:29:14.051
I only wanted a future.

01:29:16.518 --> 01:29:18.430
<i>We had a future.</i>

01:29:21.439 --> 01:29:22.975
<i>It may not have been bright,</i>

01:29:25.527 --> 01:29:26.643
<i>but it was ours.</i>

01:29:39.165 --> 01:29:40.246
You have to take it.

01:29:41.835 --> 01:29:42.996
Take it.

01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:50.084
Promise, promise me, Laura.

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:51.218
Promise me, Laura!

01:29:51.303 --> 01:29:53.511
Promise me!

01:30:37.515 --> 01:30:38.847
I promise.

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:49.896
Now, breathe.

01:30:56.993 --> 01:30:58.074
<i>Aaron!</i>

01:31:01.164 --> 01:31:02.164
<i>Aaron!</i>

01:31:04.084 --> 01:31:05.200
<i>Come back.</i>

01:31:07.128 --> 01:31:08.128
<i>I'm here.</i>

01:31:09.214 --> 01:31:10.330
<i>I'm still here.</i>

01:31:12.676 --> 01:31:13.837
<i>I promise.</i>

01:31:17.514 --> 01:31:19.471
<i>I promise.</i>
