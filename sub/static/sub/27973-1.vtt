01:15.081 --> 01:17.441
Alarm! Alarm!

01:17.561 --> 01:18.881
Alarm!

01:20.001 --> 01:21.281
Cycle the vents.

01:21.841 --> 01:22.841
Clear the bridge.

01:23.561 --> 01:24.881
- Get down.
- Get out of my way!

01:25.241 --> 01:26.681
Hurry! Go, go, go!

01:27.241 --> 01:28.201
Hurry!

01:28.321 --> 01:29.521
Hurry!

01:29.881 --> 01:32.241
Don't stand around, work the pumps!

01:32.441 --> 01:34.521
Hurry! I said, hurry!

01:34.881 --> 01:36.001
Hurry up!

01:41.121 --> 01:42.681
Close conning tower hatch!

01:43.761 --> 01:45.321
The Captain has gone overboard!

01:45.641 --> 01:46.761
Three zero meters!

01:47.641 --> 01:48.961
All hands forward!

02:02.601 --> 02:03.401
Come on!

02:03.521 --> 02:04.521
Hurry!

02:04.601 --> 02:06.881
Hurry! Go, go, go, go!

02:06.961 --> 02:08.721
Faster! Hurry!

02:08.801 --> 02:11.281
Come on. Go, go, go. Faster!

02:49.561 --> 02:50.881
Propeller noises!

02:59.961 --> 03:02.281
Slow speed ahead!

03:02.801 --> 03:04.641
Take her down! One two zero meters!

03:04.721 --> 03:07.201
Full down on the bow planes.
Ten degrees down on the stern planes.

03:16.201 --> 03:17.201
Bearing!

03:18.521 --> 03:20.161
Propeller noises in one-one-zero.

03:20.321 --> 03:21.161
Approaching.

03:22.161 --> 03:23.201
Probably a destroyer.

03:24.841 --> 03:26.801
Take her down, Chief! Take her down!

03:27.081 --> 03:29.721
Full down on the bow planes.
Zero degrees on the stern planes.

04:04.361 --> 04:05.561
Depth charges!

04:35.521 --> 04:36.721
All compartments report damage.

04:37.441 --> 04:39.001
Pump out bilges.

04:48.761 --> 04:49.641
Hold this depth!

04:50.201 --> 04:51.361
Silent running!

05:15.041 --> 05:17.001
Second propeller noises
in three five zero.

05:17.801 --> 05:18.841
Approaching!

05:52.001 --> 05:53.001
Depth charges!

05:53.201 --> 05:54.201
Dozens!

06:08.081 --> 06:10.881
Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name,

06:11.521 --> 06:15.121
your kingdom come, your will be done,
on earth as in...

10:46.241 --> 10:47.081
Documents!

10:47.441 --> 10:48.721
Just a second, please.

10:50.721 --> 10:51.761
Here you go.

10:55.841 --> 10:56.921
Where are you traveling to?

10:57.121 --> 10:58.241
To La Rochelle.

11:00.361 --> 11:02.001
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

11:02.281 --> 11:03.361
Documents.

11:09.401 --> 11:10.401
Documents.

11:41.881 --> 11:43.041
Simone Strasser?

11:44.401 --> 11:45.441
Yes. Margot Bostal?

11:46.081 --> 11:47.521
The door is open. First floor.

11:48.401 --> 11:49.241
Thanks.

11:55.161 --> 11:57.561
Blame the Germans.

11:57.721 --> 11:58.961
They billeted you with me.

12:00.001 --> 12:02.761
No smoking. No men allowed in the room.

12:02.881 --> 12:04.761
I expect you to be tidy.

12:05.201 --> 12:06.521
Me too.

12:25.361 --> 12:26.921
I brought you something.

12:28.241 --> 12:29.561
Soap from Paris.

12:31.881 --> 12:32.881
Thanks.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.801
Where did you learn
to speak such good French?

12:37.321 --> 12:38.441
I'm from Alsace.

12:41.681 --> 12:44.081
If one of us is at home, the door
stays unlocked. If not, lock it twice.

12:44.521 --> 12:45.681
I have to go to work.

12:46.561 --> 12:48.041
Which hospital are you working at?

12:48.161 --> 12:49.801
There's just the one, around the corner.

12:51.561 --> 12:53.201
If you're hungry there's some bread
in the kitchen.

12:53.641 --> 12:54.561
Thanks.

13:06.081 --> 13:09.761
In summation, the actions of the
accused Petty Officer, Joachim WeiÃŸgerber,

13:09.841 --> 13:12.721
amount to an act of cowardice
in the face of the enemy.

13:13.401 --> 13:15.001
And this is a sworn statement

13:15.201 --> 13:19.641
in your capacity as First Watch Officer on
the mission in question?

13:21.241 --> 13:22.201
Correct.

13:23.361 --> 13:26.001
Then the case against the accused has been

13:26.041 --> 13:28.561
clearly made by an officer.

13:29.201 --> 13:31.281
Do you have anything to say?

13:44.361 --> 13:45.561
We were under attack.

13:48.241 --> 13:49.401
They say that's...

13:50.801 --> 13:53.201
when your training will kick in.

13:54.521 --> 13:55.921
But that didn't happen. Not for me.

13:56.881 --> 13:59.561
We came under attack and I... I hid.

14:00.841 --> 14:04.041
I failed myself and my crew mates.

14:05.681 --> 14:08.001
I disappointed them and I'm sorry.

14:09.521 --> 14:12.121
Your cowardly behavior is
in direct opposition

14:12.241 --> 14:14.401
to our fight for the final victory.

14:16.321 --> 14:19.441
The regulations
of the German Navy are unambiguous.

14:24.281 --> 14:25.801
You are thereby sentenced...

14:26.961 --> 14:28.001
to death by firing squad.

14:29.321 --> 14:30.721
Court is adjourned.

14:36.241 --> 14:39.001
Captain Hoffmann, may I also
take this opportunity

14:39.081 --> 14:42.321
to publicly congratulate you on
your promotion to CO.

14:49.401 --> 14:51.241
Your father must be very proud.

14:56.201 --> 14:57.201
Congratulations!

14:57.801 --> 14:58.721
Thanks!

15:42.721 --> 15:44.441
- Simone!
- Frank!

15:45.641 --> 15:46.881
Get a room.

15:46.961 --> 15:48.441
She's my big sister.

15:48.561 --> 15:49.361
Idiot!

15:50.121 --> 15:51.281
I missed you so much.

15:51.361 --> 15:52.761
Missed you too.

15:52.841 --> 15:53.841
How are you?

15:53.921 --> 15:54.961
Fine!

15:56.361 --> 15:57.761
They moved the transfer forward.

15:57.881 --> 15:59.961
I thought I'd surprise you.

16:02.121 --> 16:03.001
And you?

16:05.001 --> 16:06.081
You look tired.

16:07.921 --> 16:08.961
Well, lots to do.

16:11.681 --> 16:13.121
- Come on! I'll show you around.
- Yes.

16:17.921 --> 16:19.041
Amazing!

16:20.881 --> 16:22.001
It is indeed.

16:22.561 --> 16:24.921
It's so... huge!

16:25.801 --> 16:30.801
Yeah, seven moorings and those three
are soon to be put into service.

16:31.521 --> 16:32.961
But the roof is made
of reinforced concrete.

16:33.001 --> 16:34.121
And seven meters thick.

16:34.921 --> 16:37.121
It's hard for me to imagine it.

16:37.761 --> 16:41.321
What's it like to be on board a U-boat?
Deep down below?

16:42.681 --> 16:45.561
Forty guys, no shower, one shitter.
You want to know more?

16:48.321 --> 16:50.041
This one sails tomorrow.

16:51.761 --> 16:52.721
Is something wrong?

16:53.921 --> 16:55.161
Did I say something?

16:57.001 --> 16:58.001
No.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.801
Things are just difficult at the moment.

17:04.801 --> 17:06.401
It's not important. Forget it.

17:07.321 --> 17:08.321
Really.

17:10.081 --> 17:11.281
I...

17:11.561 --> 17:13.721
I have to report in at Headquarters.

17:15.241 --> 17:17.401
Pick me up later
and we'll have dinner together.

17:18.401 --> 17:19.281
What time?

17:19.881 --> 17:21.121
I get off duty at 7:00 p.m.

17:22.281 --> 17:23.121
Okay.

17:26.881 --> 17:27.721
Simone...

17:29.241 --> 17:30.961
I am really happy that you're here.

17:31.841 --> 17:33.561
I'm very happy, too.

17:34.321 --> 17:35.641
See you later.

18:06.561 --> 18:09.041
Eleven U-boats. This month alone.

18:10.401 --> 18:11.801
You think the English are listening in?

18:12.081 --> 18:13.641
I don't think so. No.

18:15.321 --> 18:18.681
Enigma is the safest cipher machine
in the world.

18:19.041 --> 18:22.721
Besides, it's twelve missing boats now.
Look.

18:30.241 --> 18:32.081
U-113 is missing? Wrangel?

18:32.321 --> 18:34.441
Their last radio contact was more
than three weeks ago.

18:35.321 --> 18:36.361
Fuck!

18:37.601 --> 18:40.601
The production of new boats is running
at full speed.

18:40.681 --> 18:43.721
The problem lies more
with recruiting new crews.

18:44.201 --> 18:46.201
Soon, we'll only be able
to fall back on rookies

18:46.361 --> 18:48.281
or war-worn veterans.

18:49.001 --> 18:49.841
Yes, come in!

18:52.761 --> 18:53.761
Hoffmann!

18:56.361 --> 18:57.841
Reporting for duty, Commander.

18:58.121 --> 19:00.001
Allow me to introduce
Criminal Inspector Forster

19:00.081 --> 19:01.041
from the Gestapo.

19:02.841 --> 19:03.681
Pleased to meet you.

19:03.761 --> 19:06.201
Criminal Inspector,
this is Captain Hoffmann.

19:06.441 --> 19:08.881
Ah! Are you related to that Hoffmann?

19:09.561 --> 19:10.921
I am his son. Yes.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.201
So, you're commanding one
of the new boats?

19:14.121 --> 19:16.001
Brand new Captain, brand new boat.

19:16.401 --> 19:19.241
And the crew has been newly constituted.

19:19.361 --> 19:21.881
In my opinion the ideal blend of

19:21.961 --> 19:24.801
many years of experience
and young enthusiasm.

19:25.001 --> 19:25.961
Your log book.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.521
This is where your heroic story
will be recorded.

19:44.401 --> 19:46.361
Hey, hey!

19:46.921 --> 19:49.161
Why is this taking so long?

19:49.241 --> 19:50.281
It's not that easy.

19:50.361 --> 19:51.961
Hurry up, man!

19:52.961 --> 19:54.561
Why are we doing this so late?

19:54.641 --> 19:57.961
I'll tell you. Because the ships aren't
put together correctly in Kiel anymore.

19:58.001 --> 19:59.921
And why? Because of cheap foreign labor.

20:00.161 --> 20:02.161
And this mess is the result.

20:03.961 --> 20:06.321
By the way, thank you for putting
in a word on my behalf.

20:08.001 --> 20:09.721
Your fitness for service
was never in doubt.

20:10.081 --> 20:11.561
We need solid men like you.

20:12.001 --> 20:13.241
Good to have you back, Chief.

20:14.281 --> 20:15.801
Good to be busy.

20:22.121 --> 20:23.841
Departure on schedule,
Second Watch Officer?

20:24.161 --> 20:26.401
Some electrical malfunction
in the radio room.

20:26.601 --> 20:27.921
You'll inform the Captain?

20:28.801 --> 20:29.961
When I see him.

20:30.761 --> 20:34.041
Sir, I speak for the whole crew
in saying that

20:34.121 --> 20:36.721
when the day comes,
you'll make an excellent Captain...

20:37.001 --> 20:38.001
Leave it!

20:48.041 --> 20:49.641
I was asked to bring this.

20:53.521 --> 20:56.601
Yes, I'd be pleased to meet up
with you next week again.

20:56.681 --> 20:58.761
- Commander Gluck?
- Yes.

20:59.001 --> 21:00.961
May I introduce you to Simone Strasser,

21:01.041 --> 21:02.441
the new translator.

21:03.281 --> 21:04.521
Pleased to meet you.

21:05.601 --> 21:06.441
Likewise.

21:06.721 --> 21:08.601
- You're French.
- No. German.

21:08.961 --> 21:10.001
Really? May I?

21:10.801 --> 21:14.441
When I was born, Alsace was German.
And now it's German again.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.881
And the 22 years
in between we'll just forget?

21:17.281 --> 21:19.041
Maybe you should ask my brother that.

21:19.121 --> 21:20.041
Why your brother?

21:20.321 --> 21:22.441
Petty Officer Radio Frank Strasser.

21:23.001 --> 21:27.081
Four war tours. Injured in the line
of duty. Holder of the U-Boat War Badge.

21:27.281 --> 21:29.361
Not bad for a Frenchman, isn't it?

21:30.161 --> 21:31.041
TouchÃ©!

21:31.121 --> 21:32.801
Welcome, Miss Strasser.

21:33.441 --> 21:35.601
My adjutant will show you to your station.

21:41.241 --> 21:42.081
Follow me, please.

21:43.641 --> 21:48.361
Hurry up, boys! Make sure you spread
the load according to the stowage plan.

21:48.441 --> 21:51.521
Got to keep the boat perfectly balanced!
At all times.

21:51.601 --> 21:52.721
Veer away.

21:53.601 --> 21:54.681
Veer away!

21:55.601 --> 21:57.161
Veer away!

21:57.601 --> 21:59.241
Veer away!

22:14.721 --> 22:18.081
Ralf Grothe, Petty Officer Electrician.
Just transferred in.

22:18.721 --> 22:20.041
Pips, diesel engine.

22:20.121 --> 22:21.401
Turn it off!

22:23.201 --> 22:24.401
Where are you from?

22:24.761 --> 22:25.681
Windhoek.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.041
Africa, really?

22:27.281 --> 22:29.241
Have you ever fucked a Negress?

22:29.321 --> 22:30.161
Yep.

22:30.441 --> 22:31.281
Really?

22:31.601 --> 22:33.121
Yep. Really!

23:12.881 --> 23:15.801
At the crossing of Rue Pernelle
and Rue Aufredi. Behind the church.

23:16.801 --> 23:17.801
A woman.

23:18.041 --> 23:18.921
When?

23:19.281 --> 23:21.201
Tonight. Shortly before 10:00 p.m.

23:21.881 --> 23:24.801
Be on time. Give her what was agreed
and take what you asked for in return.

23:26.761 --> 23:28.161
It's a bad time.

23:30.361 --> 23:32.601
Could you move the meeting?
To another day?

23:34.121 --> 23:35.321
How do you think it works?

23:36.321 --> 23:38.721
I'm just the messenger.
They set the rules.

23:39.721 --> 23:41.681
I am sure this is difficult
to accept for a German.

23:46.441 --> 23:48.601
Do it or the deal's off.

23:51.681 --> 23:52.801
Goodbye, Monsieur.

23:54.201 --> 23:55.441
How old are you?

23:56.601 --> 23:58.761
Seventeen years. Two months. Six days.

23:59.601 --> 24:02.441
Kiss my ass. We've got a baby on board!

24:02.561 --> 24:04.681
Don't worry, Thorsten.
We'll look after you!

24:06.001 --> 24:06.881
Right lads!

24:07.561 --> 24:09.401
Let's slide it into
that tight little hole.

24:09.641 --> 24:11.321
That's what I will do
with my cock tonight.

24:11.521 --> 24:12.881
Yours is just not as big, right?

24:14.121 --> 24:15.321
The holes are neither.

24:16.601 --> 24:18.041
Shut the fuck up and do your job.

24:18.801 --> 24:19.761
Release the safety.

24:19.841 --> 24:21.401
- Safety's off!
- Move it!

24:24.881 --> 24:26.841
- Secure it!
- Secured!

24:33.521 --> 24:34.561
Okay, forwards!

24:41.081 --> 24:42.281
Give way!

24:46.921 --> 24:48.321
Herrmann, take a sip.

24:49.121 --> 24:50.921
Got it from that mad farmer. 60 proof.

24:51.841 --> 24:53.361
That will just make you go blind.

24:57.361 --> 24:58.201
Peter!

24:58.401 --> 24:59.321
Take a sip!

25:00.081 --> 25:00.961
No thanks.

25:04.721 --> 25:05.961
So, how are we doing?

25:06.201 --> 25:07.721
Weapons are all accounted for.

25:07.921 --> 25:09.241
Lock and secure weapon box.

25:09.321 --> 25:10.241
Aye!

25:17.121 --> 25:18.241
Latest weather report?

25:18.961 --> 25:21.001
Heavy mist coming in tonight,
but stiff north-westerly winds.

25:21.121 --> 25:22.641
I think it'll clear by morning.

25:25.161 --> 25:27.361
All torpedoes checked and loaded, Sir.

25:27.601 --> 25:29.001
Good to see you again.

25:29.921 --> 25:31.161
Likewise, Josef.

25:31.401 --> 25:33.121
Report for duty at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow.

25:33.281 --> 25:35.121
Ah, and the cook got something for you.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.161
Great!

25:36.241 --> 25:37.201
Upwards!

25:41.321 --> 25:44.321
Engines are running smoothly.
Puts me in a good mood!

25:45.561 --> 25:47.121
The Captain shown up yet?

25:47.201 --> 25:48.201
He doesn't have to.

25:48.561 --> 25:50.601
It's my duty to prepare the boat.

25:55.641 --> 25:58.001
What? Just the one?
What if I want to do it again?

25:58.361 --> 25:59.521
Then don't take it off.

26:03.081 --> 26:04.761
Don't lose it. You're going to need it.

26:05.121 --> 26:06.281
Against infection.

26:06.801 --> 26:10.441
Knew a guy once, helmsman on U-491,
unfortunately already dead.

26:10.841 --> 26:13.201
He caught something
the night before he sailed.

26:13.281 --> 26:16.601
Itching got so bad,
he took my cheese-grater to it.

26:16.681 --> 26:17.601
No, really?

26:18.001 --> 26:19.241
True story!

26:21.721 --> 26:25.881
Something you need to know, killer.
It's bad luck to take a virgin on board.

26:26.561 --> 26:28.681
You have to blow your load tonight,
for good luck!

26:29.721 --> 26:30.641
Come on lads.

26:31.001 --> 26:32.081
Let's christen the boat.

26:34.721 --> 26:37.921
They've got to break.
Or else it's bad luck.

26:39.801 --> 26:42.881
- Prepare soundings!
- Prepare soundings!

26:42.961 --> 26:44.001
Soundings!

26:44.161 --> 26:47.521
Soundings! In zero!

27:02.321 --> 27:03.801
Move! I'll do it.

27:22.561 --> 27:23.601
Holy shit!

27:23.881 --> 27:24.721
Fire extinguisher!

28:01.441 --> 28:02.921
I came to apologize to you.

28:05.641 --> 28:06.841
Maybe I was wrong.

28:09.081 --> 28:10.761
Maybe you shouldn't have made a statement.

28:19.321 --> 28:21.761
I felt better once I admitted it.

28:25.801 --> 28:27.081
That I am not a hero.

28:30.721 --> 28:32.121
If the boat had been sunk...

28:32.961 --> 28:34.641
nobody would know, right?

28:36.961 --> 28:38.921
No one would know whose fault it was.

28:39.401 --> 28:41.281
If that boat had gone down...

28:42.441 --> 28:44.121
then I'd have died a hero.

28:54.521 --> 28:55.641
Will you come?

28:57.841 --> 28:58.921
Tomorrow morning?

28:59.281 --> 29:00.401
Of course.

29:03.561 --> 29:05.281
Is there anything I can do for you?

29:15.801 --> 29:17.161
That's my mother's address.

29:20.001 --> 29:21.521
Could you write to her...

29:22.081 --> 29:23.801
that I took it like a man?

29:52.441 --> 29:54.121
It'll have to be rebuilt from scratch.

29:55.601 --> 29:58.721
I need new parts for this.
It'll take at least 24 hours.

29:58.881 --> 30:00.161
You'll do it tonight.

30:02.041 --> 30:03.361
Sir, that's impo...

30:03.441 --> 30:05.081
Give MÃ¼ller a list of your requirements.

30:05.721 --> 30:07.961
He will also retrieve
your personal effects.

30:08.921 --> 30:09.761
My effects?

30:09.921 --> 30:12.841
You are being assigned to the radio room
of U-612 for this war cruise.

30:13.201 --> 30:14.321
With immediate effect.

30:15.641 --> 30:17.121
With permission, Sir,

30:17.641 --> 30:19.321
isn't there anybody else who could go?

30:19.761 --> 30:22.521
The assigned Petty Officer Radio is
in the hospital with severe burns.

30:22.601 --> 30:24.121
Your orders are to replace him.

30:24.201 --> 30:26.241
Or should I have you arrested
for refusal to serve?

30:26.321 --> 30:28.441
No! No.

30:29.001 --> 30:29.881
Good.

30:30.721 --> 30:32.801
Tell him the location of your dormitory.

30:33.441 --> 30:35.241
This boat will sail tomorrow on time.

30:35.641 --> 30:38.081
With you and a functioning radio.

30:40.801 --> 30:42.521
Sir, if I might request.

30:43.401 --> 30:45.721
Would it be possible
that my sister would bring my effects?

30:45.801 --> 30:47.081
She just arrived today.

30:47.441 --> 30:49.321
She works for Captain Gluck.

30:50.841 --> 30:53.001
It would help me with the work if she...

31:00.041 --> 31:00.921
I'm sorry.

31:06.801 --> 31:09.041
The radio operator is not
to leave the boat.

31:09.121 --> 31:10.401
A woman will bring his effects.

31:10.561 --> 31:11.361
But...

31:11.441 --> 31:12.961
Don't give me that superstitious nonsense.

31:13.001 --> 31:15.321
Just make sure that she doesn't
distract him from his work.

31:20.281 --> 31:21.761
Have a nice evening.

31:22.081 --> 31:23.161
And you.

31:27.241 --> 31:28.081
Miss Strasser.

31:30.401 --> 31:32.601
I haven't really introduced myself.

31:32.721 --> 31:33.721
Criminal Inspector Forster.

31:35.241 --> 31:36.201
Good evening.

31:37.361 --> 31:38.361
Well...

31:39.561 --> 31:41.921
Your first day
and you're the last to leave.

31:42.321 --> 31:45.081
No wonder your supervisor in Paris
was so sorry to see you leave.

31:46.681 --> 31:49.561
Oh. You must have read
my file very carefully then.

31:49.921 --> 31:51.921
I read all files. Bad habit.

31:52.401 --> 31:57.921
I told Gluck that it would be a crime
if you were wasted on mundane work.

31:58.081 --> 32:00.001
Ah. Thank you so much.

32:00.081 --> 32:03.281
Well, consider it my attempt
at an apology.

32:03.601 --> 32:04.561
For what?

32:04.681 --> 32:08.041
For making you think that I would question
your loyalty towards Germany.

32:09.401 --> 32:14.641
Maybe my loyalty is so big
because I grew up in Alsace

32:15.041 --> 32:17.841
and because I could only admire Germany
from a distance.

32:18.641 --> 32:22.401
As a German I always felt
like a stranger in France.

32:23.801 --> 32:24.801
You won't feel like this here.

32:25.161 --> 32:26.241
Miss Strasser?

32:27.201 --> 32:28.561
- I apologize.
- Yes?

32:29.281 --> 32:30.321
It's about your brother.

32:31.881 --> 32:32.721
Yes?

33:03.521 --> 33:06.921
So that's what it feels like
to fire a torpedo?

33:08.561 --> 33:10.001
Feels like fucking?

33:12.321 --> 33:13.401
That's right.

33:15.761 --> 33:17.201
At least afterwards.

33:21.081 --> 33:24.161
You son of a bitch! Stick it inside her!

33:25.081 --> 33:26.121
Already have!

33:26.801 --> 33:30.321
There he is! Come on, killer. Get her!

33:31.081 --> 33:33.401
Your dick knows where to go!

33:39.001 --> 33:40.041
I want one too.

34:10.721 --> 34:11.721
Thank you.

34:13.241 --> 34:14.081
Keep the change.

34:16.121 --> 34:17.001
Thanks.

34:18.641 --> 34:20.121
You are from La Rochelle?

34:20.921 --> 34:21.841
Yes.

34:22.761 --> 34:23.601
What's your name?

34:24.881 --> 34:25.721
Nathalie.

34:25.801 --> 34:27.721
That's nice... suits you.

34:27.801 --> 34:29.441
A beer for my comrade.

34:30.401 --> 34:31.601
Comrade.

34:34.161 --> 34:36.121
That's what it's all about. Team spirit.

34:38.161 --> 34:39.001
You've been upstairs?

34:39.441 --> 34:40.401
For money?

34:40.721 --> 34:41.801
Not really my style.

34:42.001 --> 34:43.201
You're a faggot or what?

34:43.721 --> 34:44.561
No. Why?

34:44.881 --> 34:47.521
You speak French,
you don't like to fuck...

34:48.801 --> 34:50.001
Are you castrated?

34:57.921 --> 35:00.401
Hey, why did you pick this one?

35:00.841 --> 35:05.961
Ouch. I'd rather have a hooker in bed
than a girl somewhere far away.

35:10.361 --> 35:11.201
Cheers.

35:31.361 --> 35:32.521
Are you still in?

35:44.321 --> 35:45.521
Show me.

36:05.321 --> 36:06.161
Nice game.

36:07.961 --> 36:11.161
You fucking asshole. Cheating bastard!

36:17.601 --> 36:18.801
Call the police!

36:19.321 --> 36:20.561
Call the police!

36:20.681 --> 36:24.041
"My deepest condolences
on the passing of your son..."

36:27.721 --> 36:28.561
Come in!

36:31.241 --> 36:34.441
Captain, U-612 is ready
for scheduled departure.

36:36.721 --> 36:37.801
Any problems?

36:38.561 --> 36:39.361
None.

36:41.401 --> 36:42.601
A splendid boat.

36:46.241 --> 36:48.961
I had wondered whether you'd like
to join some of the men.

36:49.001 --> 36:50.841
As is customary on these occasions.

36:51.121 --> 36:52.961
We needn't be a slave to custom.

36:53.561 --> 36:57.561
Other Captains have felt it benefits
morale to make oneself visible.

36:57.961 --> 37:01.081
I'm sure the men would prefer to do
their drinking and whoring alone.

37:01.761 --> 37:04.881
Wouldn't you?
But we can have a drink together,

37:05.041 --> 37:06.161
First Watch Officer.

37:07.001 --> 37:08.001
Cognac?

37:08.881 --> 37:09.841
Thank you.

37:14.961 --> 37:16.801
HANDBOOK FOR U-BOAT CAPTAINS

37:16.881 --> 37:20.281
Don't tell anyone,
but I haven't finished reading it.

37:21.761 --> 37:24.321
I was just trying to make sense
of paragraph 15.

37:25.561 --> 37:29.921
"During an attack, situations may develop
which appear to be hopeless.

37:30.241 --> 37:33.601
Only if the Captain,
unrelenting towards himself,

37:33.761 --> 37:37.041
conquers this feeling, will he succeed."

37:37.881 --> 37:39.241
A key part of the text.

37:41.201 --> 37:44.361
If the Captain really believes
that a situation is hopeless...

37:45.881 --> 37:47.401
should he risk the lives of his men?

37:48.601 --> 37:50.121
Hopelessness is not a fact...

37:51.001 --> 37:53.281
but a state of mind to be overcome.

37:54.001 --> 37:56.881
The key element is "unrelenting
towards himself".

38:00.761 --> 38:01.961
How is your father?

38:02.521 --> 38:03.561
I hope he's well.

38:05.401 --> 38:06.401
He endures.

38:07.081 --> 38:08.801
I first read his book as a young man.

38:09.721 --> 38:11.841
It's been an inspiration
throughout my career.

38:12.521 --> 38:14.001
How long have you been in the forces?

38:14.161 --> 38:15.121
Since '37.

38:16.841 --> 38:18.081
I don't have your experience.

38:20.001 --> 38:21.241
But you're in command.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.001
The boat is yours.

38:31.001 --> 38:32.161
Good night, Sir.

39:11.521 --> 39:12.601
Frank?

39:12.681 --> 39:13.841
Simone?

39:14.321 --> 39:15.321
Frank?

39:19.761 --> 39:21.441
They say you're sailing tomorrow.

39:22.761 --> 39:23.641
Is that true?

39:25.601 --> 39:26.521
Come with me.

39:30.681 --> 39:32.001
Legs first.

39:39.401 --> 39:41.641
I brought your records.

39:42.441 --> 39:43.601
The records. Thanks.

39:43.681 --> 39:45.001
I thought you'd miss them.

39:45.361 --> 39:46.721
I am screwed.

39:47.321 --> 39:50.001
I have to go.
If not, I'll be court-martialed.

39:51.601 --> 39:54.121
There's something I need you
to do for me. Tonight.

39:54.281 --> 39:55.521
Rue Pernelle 42.

39:55.601 --> 39:57.641
At the corner to Rue Aufredi.

39:57.721 --> 39:58.841
Behind the church.

39:58.921 --> 40:01.721
Shortly before 10:00 p.m.
a woman will show up. Give her this.

40:02.041 --> 40:03.441
There's an envelope in there.

40:04.201 --> 40:05.801
I get something from her in return.

40:05.921 --> 40:09.041
Take it to my private apartment
at this address.

40:09.641 --> 40:12.001
Don't go there in uniform.
Only in civvies.

40:12.881 --> 40:14.241
Is it something illegal?

40:15.241 --> 40:16.681
Tell me that it's nothing illegal!

40:17.521 --> 40:18.881
It's about my life

40:19.361 --> 40:20.721
about everything I have.

40:22.041 --> 40:24.001
I'd do it myself if I...

40:24.281 --> 40:25.321
Christ! What's up?

40:29.281 --> 40:30.161
Sir!

40:31.321 --> 40:34.601
Petty Officer Radio Frank Strasser.
My sister Simone Strasser.

40:35.761 --> 40:39.001
You know that women have no place
on board, Petty Officer Strasser?

40:40.641 --> 40:41.721
Pleased to meet you.

40:42.721 --> 40:44.321
I just came to bring my brothers effects.

40:45.441 --> 40:47.161
I've been assigned at short notice.

40:47.281 --> 40:49.041
For repairs and the war cruise.

40:49.721 --> 40:51.441
There was a fire in the radio room.

40:53.201 --> 40:54.521
A fire?

40:56.201 --> 40:57.601
Yes, this afternoon.

40:59.681 --> 41:01.281
Simone. The Captain is right.

41:02.001 --> 41:03.921
It's bad luck for a woman to be here.

41:09.401 --> 41:10.881
Take care of yourself.

41:18.961 --> 41:20.281
Legs first.

41:26.561 --> 41:27.641
Can you fix this?

41:29.401 --> 41:30.401
I think so.

41:36.281 --> 41:38.521
Well then, see you tomorrow.

42:02.121 --> 42:03.561
He said you were cheating.

42:04.041 --> 42:05.241
I don't understand a word.

42:14.361 --> 42:15.441
- Take him away.
- Sir.

42:40.921 --> 42:41.841
Sorry.

42:43.161 --> 42:46.641
Do you have access to...

42:47.001 --> 42:50.001
coffee... sugar... or cigarettes?

42:52.281 --> 42:53.281
No.

43:27.961 --> 43:30.681
CIRCUIT DIAGRAM OF THE ON-BOARD RADIO-SET

43:45.561 --> 43:46.641
Impossible.

43:47.201 --> 43:48.761
I'm not asking for a pardon.

43:49.321 --> 43:51.041
I'm asking you to suspend
the death penalty.

43:51.321 --> 43:53.121
Why didn't you speak up during the trial?

43:54.041 --> 43:55.401
The opportunity didn't arise.

43:56.441 --> 43:57.761
But I feel responsible.

43:57.841 --> 43:58.681
And rightly so.

43:58.961 --> 44:02.281
This man will be shot tomorrow
because your statement condemned him.

44:02.761 --> 44:04.961
As an officer and now a Captain,

44:05.041 --> 44:07.081
you have to start living
with that responsibility.

44:07.641 --> 44:10.001
That is the power invested
in you by the German Navy.

44:10.761 --> 44:12.401
And what about my power to help him?

44:13.441 --> 44:14.961
To save the life of a fellow crewman?

44:15.001 --> 44:18.721
Hoffmann! Why would you question yourself
in this way? Why now?

44:18.921 --> 44:20.641
Because now I'm expected to command a crew

44:20.721 --> 44:22.961
who probably think the only reason
I've got promoted, is because...

44:23.081 --> 44:24.241
Because?

44:26.201 --> 44:27.321
Because I'm his son.

44:27.641 --> 44:30.801
Because I'm supposed to live up
to his myth. And not because of who I am.

44:31.401 --> 44:34.041
What if I'm not the person
everyone expects me to be?

44:34.121 --> 44:39.121
Hoffmann, Germany needs you to be him.
Precisely because of who you are!

44:39.321 --> 44:42.041
And there's no room for self-doubt.
Not if we want to end this war.

44:42.681 --> 44:43.801
To end it?

44:45.681 --> 44:47.721
This morning it was still
about 'winning it.'

44:51.241 --> 44:52.681
This boy dies tomorrow.

44:53.321 --> 44:55.961
If it makes you understand
who you need to be,

44:56.441 --> 44:58.161
then his death will have meaning.

45:51.281 --> 45:52.281
Who are you?

45:52.361 --> 45:54.961
I am supposed to give you something.
From Frank.

45:55.441 --> 45:56.561
I don't know any Frank!

45:56.841 --> 45:58.281
He sent me. I'm his sister.

45:59.241 --> 46:00.441
You've got something for me?

46:07.761 --> 46:10.281
You've got something for me!
Give it to me!

46:12.521 --> 46:13.721
Stop!

46:13.801 --> 46:14.921
Police!

46:17.681 --> 46:18.961
Stop!

46:20.001 --> 46:22.001
Stop. We'll shoot.

46:23.281 --> 46:24.521
Can't see them anymore.

46:25.201 --> 46:27.721
There, there's another one. Stop at once.

46:27.801 --> 46:28.761
Stop!

46:30.561 --> 46:31.361
Stop.

47:10.241 --> 47:11.841
What are you doing here?

47:12.081 --> 47:13.441
Working.

47:14.001 --> 47:15.521
This is the house of the Lord.

47:16.081 --> 47:18.241
You can pray or confess your sins here.

47:18.641 --> 47:20.681
Do you wish to confess your sins, Pierre?

47:34.441 --> 47:35.321
Come with me.

47:36.041 --> 47:37.041
Hurry!

47:37.561 --> 47:39.601
Leave before even more police arrive.

51:00.321 --> 51:02.081
Crew! Attention!

51:03.721 --> 51:07.641
For the report to the Captain. Left face!

51:18.401 --> 51:21.961
First Watch Officer Tennstedt reporting:
Crew lined up for inspection.

51:30.241 --> 51:31.081
At ease!

51:35.121 --> 51:36.601
We are men of the sea.

51:38.841 --> 51:40.921
That means that we have
to confront not only the elements...

51:41.441 --> 51:43.401
but the enemy.

51:44.681 --> 51:46.361
Out there we're on our own.

51:48.361 --> 51:49.521
Gentlemen.

51:52.081 --> 51:53.561
This boat is brand new.

51:55.681 --> 51:56.881
We will test it.

51:58.721 --> 52:00.561
And it will test us.

52:02.041 --> 52:05.281
And in that test be conscious of the man
who stands alongside you.

52:06.761 --> 52:09.001
As there's only one way we will prevail.

52:10.281 --> 52:11.121
Together!

52:16.441 --> 52:17.681
Take her out, First Watch Officer!

52:21.961 --> 52:24.281
What kind of fucking speech was that?

52:27.681 --> 52:29.521
Crew! Attention!

52:31.041 --> 52:32.561
Harbor stations!

52:32.841 --> 52:34.841
Harbor stations!

53:39.201 --> 53:42.081
And so we meet again. Snitch!

55:17.361 --> 55:20.321
She wasn't at the meeting point.
I waited until now.

55:50.441 --> 55:51.921
Last landmark.

55:58.441 --> 56:00.201
Let's see how she does below.

56:01.881 --> 56:02.801
Rig ship for dive.

56:04.561 --> 56:06.401
Rig bridge for dive.

56:06.521 --> 56:07.321
Aye!

56:08.601 --> 56:09.521
Clear the bridge!

56:19.281 --> 56:21.201
The radio equipment
was badly damaged yesterday.

56:23.041 --> 56:24.521
You failed to report this.

56:27.241 --> 56:28.841
The situation was under control.

56:30.041 --> 56:31.761
Then why did you replace
the radio operator?

56:34.081 --> 56:35.281
I didn't deem it...

56:35.601 --> 56:38.121
There was a fire on board and you
didn't tell me, First Watch Officer.

56:40.081 --> 56:42.121
Listen, I don't care how many years
of service you have,

56:42.521 --> 56:43.601
but this is my boat.

56:45.961 --> 56:48.081
I won't tolerate it again. Understood?

56:50.361 --> 56:51.281
Aye, Sir.

57:10.321 --> 57:11.801
Conning tower hatch closed.

57:15.321 --> 57:16.161
Rig buoyancy vents.

57:16.241 --> 57:17.081
Rig buoyancy vents.

57:19.081 --> 57:20.081
Aft buoyancy vent rigged.

57:20.441 --> 57:21.841
Both central buoyancy vents rigged.

57:21.921 --> 57:23.041
All buoyancy vents rigged!

57:24.001 --> 57:25.201
Cycle the vents!

57:28.521 --> 57:29.601
Three zero meters.

57:30.121 --> 57:31.681
Ten degrees dive on the bow planes.

57:32.241 --> 57:34.121
Five degrees dive on the stern planes.

58:07.761 --> 58:09.241
Good morning, Miss Strasser.

58:09.321 --> 58:11.401
Your second day of work
and you're already late?

58:11.641 --> 58:13.121
I slept badly.

58:13.201 --> 58:14.281
I see.

58:16.081 --> 58:17.321
Would you come with me, please?

58:18.401 --> 58:19.241
Why?

58:20.441 --> 58:21.801
I need your help.

58:37.161 --> 58:38.521
This used to be the Customs House.

58:39.281 --> 58:41.281
Now we use it together, the French and us.

58:42.841 --> 58:43.721
Please.

58:52.441 --> 58:53.361
Mr. Duval.

58:54.241 --> 58:57.961
This is Miss Strasser. Mr. Duval is
from the French National Police.

58:58.001 --> 58:59.721
He didn't get much sleep
either last night.

59:00.001 --> 59:01.001
Come with me, please.

59:01.521 --> 59:04.521
I know this is not part
of your normal duties,

59:04.641 --> 59:06.841
but there has been
an incident last night,

59:07.361 --> 59:09.201
probably related to the black market.

59:09.561 --> 59:13.921
Normally Duval takes care of these things
but a French police officer was shot.

59:14.241 --> 59:17.201
He's not sufficiently detached
to be of any big help

59:17.761 --> 59:19.681
and my French is still not
what it should be.

59:20.721 --> 59:22.001
It shouldn't take too long.
