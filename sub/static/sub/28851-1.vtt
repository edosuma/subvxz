01:40.634 --> 01:43.268
      Yo! Your house's big,
      congratulations, man.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.770
         Hey, hey, man.
       You really made it.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.171
           Yeah, man.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.843
    [Jordan] Yo, I'm thrilled
   you're here, but... Really?

01:50.845 --> 01:52.344
         -It's all you.
       [Jordan] Of course.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.745
  This is it, right? [chuckles]

01:53.747 --> 01:55.180
        -It's dope, man.
         [Jordan] Yeah.

01:55.182 --> 01:56.582
    A lot of work, you know?

01:56.584 --> 01:57.883
         You should see
       the backyard, bro.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.452
      Took down the fence,
        laid some side...

02:00.721 --> 02:02.888
  -Oh, you laid some side, eh?
      [Jordan] Yeah, shit.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.323
              Wow!

02:04.325 --> 02:05.824
   I had a little bit of help,
             but...

02:05.826 --> 02:07.326
             -Okay.
        -...it mostly me.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.127
         [Nick chuckles]
       [Jordan] Yo! Come.

02:09.130 --> 02:10.829
        [Nick] All right.
     [Jordan] Check it out.

02:17.138 --> 02:18.170
         [Jordan sighs]

02:18.171 --> 02:19.203
      [Jordan] This is it.
         [Nick chuckles]

02:19.607 --> 02:22.307
    [Jordan chuckles] Right?
 [Nick chuckles] Yo... Wow, man.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.477
      [Nick] Ah, no. Fuck.
         [Jordan] Yeah.

02:26.213 --> 02:27.546
         Looks good, yo.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.215
         [Jordan] Right?
           -Yeah, man.

02:30.217 --> 02:31.884
    [Jordan chuckles] Right?
    -You really lay side, eh?

02:31.886 --> 02:33.552
           Dear work.
          [sucks teeth]

02:33.554 --> 02:34.887
           So, man...

02:37.658 --> 02:38.924
  [Jordan] How you doin', man?

02:40.261 --> 02:41.660
      -Good, man, I'm good.
         [Jordan] Yeah?

02:41.662 --> 02:42.828
        -How's your dad?
           [Nick] Hmm.

02:42.830 --> 02:46.165
  Oi, man. Same old, same old.
     He quit smokin' though.

02:46.167 --> 02:47.432
    At least one of you did.

02:47.434 --> 02:48.734
       -Yeah, I know, man.
        [Jordan chuckles]

02:48.736 --> 02:49.735
        -That's good. No.
        [Nick] I don't...

02:49.737 --> 02:50.802
      Tell him I say peace.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.437
I will, man. Your father's good?

02:52.439 --> 02:55.307
Yeah, man, you know how they go.
        Figuring it out.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.209
           -For real?
        [Jordan] Yeah...

02:57.211 --> 02:59.611
   I swear I see your brother
 more than I see you still, man.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.917
         But, you know,
  that's good for him, though.

03:05.252 --> 03:07.252
        Like when we were
   still out there, you know?

03:08.222 --> 03:09.621
     [sniffs] You seen him?

03:10.424 --> 03:12.191
       Not enough, really.

03:12.193 --> 03:15.227
   I mean, it's hard with work
    and everything, you know?

03:20.301 --> 03:21.733
           [Nick tuts]
    Don't you want that, man?

03:22.836 --> 03:25.404
   -That be your thing, still?
      [Jordan] Yeah, yeah.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.574
    [Nick chuckles] Whah!
     [Jordan chuckles] Woo!

03:28.576 --> 03:31.476
           What? What?

03:31.712 --> 03:33.946
  [kisses teeth] Respect, man.
        [Jordan] Respect.

03:39.687 --> 03:42.354
-Wow, backyard, tings, yo. Jams.
         [Jordan] Yeah.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.289
             -So...
       [Jordan] Yeah, man.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.626
     -I'm proud of you, man.
          -Thanks, man.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.795
       Proud of you, man.
  Fuckin' home-owner and shit.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.263
          -Cheers, fam.
        [Jordan] Cheers.

03:51.865 --> 03:52.931
          [Nick] Hmmm.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.570
     Wow, that's, that's...

03:59.340 --> 04:00.839
         [Jordan] Yes...
       -Good for you, man.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.808
      -It's the good stuff.
         [both chuckle]

04:05.346 --> 04:07.279
     Hey, Jordan! I love it!

04:08.749 --> 04:10.282
        How about a tour?

04:12.286 --> 04:14.253
         [Jordan] Okay.
         [Nick chuckles]

04:14.888 --> 04:15.921
      [Nick] That's a tail.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.890
 -Yeah, it's whatever, you know?
          [Nick] Hmmm.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.493
    -Been out a couple times.
          [Nick] Hmmm.

04:21.661 --> 04:22.694
           She's cool.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.831
        [Nick] She cool?
         [Jordan] Yeah.

04:27.735 --> 04:28.967
    Yeah. Real talk, though.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.402
        If you need help
       around the house...

04:31.305 --> 04:32.771
    -You know I'm here, man.
             -Yeah?

04:32.773 --> 04:34.573
      Yeah, dog, I'm here.

04:34.575 --> 04:35.841
       [chuckles] I got a
    whole fucking truck, man.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.609
        Yeah, it's...

04:41.615 --> 04:42.814
          [Nick] What?

04:43.050 --> 04:44.650
        -No, it's just...
            -What?

04:44.652 --> 04:46.018
      [Jordan] I, I did...

04:46.487 --> 04:48.353
         I have managed
 to fuck up the garage already,

04:48.355 --> 04:50.322
 -but I get a ball in the week.
           [Nick] No.

04:50.324 --> 04:52.357
  If you fucked up the garage,
      I'll go check it now.

04:52.359 --> 04:53.659
     I'll fix it right now.

04:53.661 --> 04:54.860
          [Jordan] Yo.
          -Real quick.

04:58.766 --> 05:01.466
     [Crossland] Is this it?
[Chris] Sweet. Yeah, this is it.

05:01.802 --> 05:02.701
       [Chris sighs] Okay.

05:04.938 --> 05:07.339
     All right. Here we are.
           This is it.

05:07.975 --> 05:11.009
 So, I'm thinkin'... Half hour?
    Tops. We get outta here?

05:11.011 --> 05:12.878
       Eight thirty tops.
   I think that's a nice time.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.646
        -Shall we just...
        [Crossland] Yeah.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.081
  Party table the booze, or...

05:16.083 --> 05:18.050
    Find Jordan and actually
      give him the bottle?

05:18.452 --> 05:20.385
   That's a... that's a gift?

05:20.854 --> 05:22.321
           What? Yeah!

05:22.323 --> 05:24.890
  You, you brought that as a...
Like this, this is for me.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.591
     I brought this for me.

05:26.593 --> 05:27.893
    It was laying at my house
     from last week. Wait...

05:27.895 --> 05:29.528
     That's all you brought?

05:29.530 --> 05:30.762
   That's not gonna be enough
         for both of us.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.364
     This is all we brought.
        That's our gift.

05:32.366 --> 05:33.899
    I'm not putting your name
          on the card.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.100
  -You brought a fucking card?
   -It's a house-warming gift.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.935
        [Crossland moans]
    [Chris] It's a big deal!

05:36.937 --> 05:38.570
    Oh, it's a big deal now?
      It's a big deal now?

05:38.572 --> 05:40.072
       What did you bring
   to my house-warming party?

05:40.074 --> 05:40.906
         You didn't have
     a house-warming party.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.374
     You didn't bring shit.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.809
            You moved
   into your dad's old condo!

05:43.811 --> 05:45.510
           It's still
   a house-warming party, man.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.845
    Jordan bought this place
       with his own money.

05:48.349 --> 05:49.448
             -What?
             -Yeah.

05:51.418 --> 05:53.352
              -Wow!
             -Yeah.

05:53.354 --> 05:54.653
  It's a real savvy investment.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.021
         [Chris] Right?

05:57.558 --> 05:59.758
    -This is a nice location.
   [Chris] Look at this shit.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.394
     Okay. Good for Jordan.
  Oh, yeah. Don't worry, uh...

06:02.930 --> 06:05.397
   Don't worry about the card,
    then. I'll do my, uh...

06:05.733 --> 06:07.432
     -I'll do my own thing.
            -Thanks.

06:08.102 --> 06:09.768
So, what are you gonna get him?

06:11.872 --> 06:13.071
 I'm gonna get him a salad bowl.

06:14.108 --> 06:15.841
          A salad bowl?

06:15.843 --> 06:17.876
  A salad bowl's a strong gift.
    You're giving him booze.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.378
 You think you're the first one
   that got him booze tonight?

06:19.380 --> 06:20.879
    -Well, no. But, I mean...
         -A salad bowl,

06:20.881 --> 06:22.981
  -that's what an adult needs.
     -Okay, do you have one?

06:22.983 --> 06:24.950
          You just have
     a salad bowl with you?

06:24.952 --> 06:27.119
  Yeah, I've got a salad bowl!
Treated wood, dude. Black Cedar.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.020
    You polish it with oil...

06:29.022 --> 06:30.021
   I think he's gonna love it.

06:30.023 --> 06:30.989
  You don't have a salad bowl?

06:30.991 --> 06:32.407
    Not like that. I mean...

06:32.408 --> 06:33.824
  What do you serve your salad
   out of, like a cereal bowl?

06:33.827 --> 06:35.460
        Most of the time.

06:35.462 --> 06:36.895
         I didn't think
       it was a big deal.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.897
You're hustling backwards, dude.
    Come on, get it together.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.733
  -Yo, Chris didn't bring shit!
      -Oh, thanks! Asshole!

06:49.810 --> 06:51.143
         [buzzing sound]

06:53.547 --> 06:55.113
  Somethin' stuck in the gears.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.882
           [Nick] Hmm,
   you playin' cards out here?

06:56.884 --> 06:58.016
          [Jordan] No.

06:58.585 --> 06:59.951
        Was it like this
       when you moved in?

07:00.888 --> 07:04.589
            -No. No.
           -Ahh, shit.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.493
        Yeah. All right.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.999
 Yeah, I was trying to clean it.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.735
      While it was on? Hmm?

07:17.004 --> 07:19.771
            -Yeah...
     [Nick chuckles] Jesus!

07:19.773 --> 07:21.173
  Yo, just unplug it for me, J.

07:21.742 --> 07:22.974
        -Unplug it, man.
             -Yeah.

07:24.111 --> 07:24.960
       Please. Thank you.

07:24.961 --> 07:25.810
   [Nick] Fuck! [kisses teeth]

07:26.547 --> 07:29.614
        [Jordan] We good.
       [Nick chuckles] Yo!

07:32.686 --> 07:34.553
      -Yeah, I tried that.
        [Nick] Oh, yeah?

07:35.656 --> 07:37.522
          I, I took out
       a couple of screws,

07:37.758 --> 07:39.724
        but I didn't know
  which ones to take out next.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.060
   So, where're the screws, J?

07:42.763 --> 07:44.529
  Put 'em with the screwdriver.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.698
   [Nick chuckles] And where's
      the screwdriver, man?

07:49.703 --> 07:51.870
    Yeah, just... It's here.
         It's somewhere.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.108
         [chuckles] God!
       [Jordan] I think...

07:57.110 --> 07:58.743
    I think I put it inside,
           all right.

07:58.745 --> 08:00.712
    -You want more Champagne?
        [Nick] Yes, sir.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.515
      [Jordan kisses teeth]

08:04.184 --> 08:06.051
          [Nick sighs]

08:08.822 --> 08:11.556
   [Nick mutters] Yeah, OK...

08:21.835 --> 08:23.201
       [Nick] Oh, my God!

08:23.203 --> 08:25.270
         Seriously, yo.
   This thing is fucked, man.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.905
         How'd you even
    get this thing in there?

08:26.907 --> 08:30.242
    I had all the tools out,
   like hammer, screwdriver...

08:30.777 --> 08:32.177
     All of it. Everything.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.714
  Dude, how about the last time
     you used a hammer, man?

08:35.716 --> 08:36.615
             Fuck...

08:36.616 --> 08:38.683
       Like when we built
        the treehouse.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.150
    [Nick and Jordan chuckle]

08:40.153 --> 08:42.053
   [Nick] Yo, man, we scored.
    That table was nice, yo.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.889
             Right?

08:43.890 --> 08:45.223
   Yo, that was the first time
       I smoked weed, man.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.691
            Nah, man.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.961
     It was in the alleyway
         in grade eight.

08:49.962 --> 08:51.228
      We tried to practice
    how to roll on the roof.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.931
         [Nick chuckles]
    -We had a dozen tea bags

08:52.933 --> 08:54.566
          of chamomile
     blown over by the wind.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.234
         [Nick] Oh, man.
      -It was cold as fuck!

08:56.236 --> 08:57.836
   -You were a bad influence.
  [Jordan] Terrible influence.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.271
   [Nick] Now look at me, man.

08:59.273 --> 09:01.106
        [Jordan chuckles]
  [Nick] I'm a bad kid, still.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.743
 [Nick grunts] You... Fuck, man.
         Seriously, yo.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.612
      Seriously, seriously,
          my word, dog.

09:07.614 --> 09:09.014
   This thing is fucked, man.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.650
     -Like, like done, done?
           -Yeah, man.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.220
          [Jordan] Hmm.

09:17.291 --> 09:18.890
         [Jordan grunts]

09:18.892 --> 09:20.292
         [Nick chuckles]
   It's broken, J, man. Fuck.

09:20.294 --> 09:21.927
   How much these things cost?

09:21.929 --> 09:23.595
      Uh, like a couple Gs,

09:23.597 --> 09:25.163
         if you include
       the door and shit.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.232
           -For real?
        [Nick] Yeah, man.

09:28.569 --> 09:29.734
              Fuck!

09:31.305 --> 09:33.071
         [kisses teeth]
      Wanna go back inside?

09:33.574 --> 09:35.273
            Nah, yo.
     I don't go back inside.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.841
 I don't know no one here, man.

09:36.843 --> 09:38.276
       Are you kidding me?
         It'll be cool.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.811
    [Jordan] All right. Cool.

09:39.813 --> 09:43.615
         [ambient music]
      [indistinct chatter]

09:48.855 --> 09:50.655
         Ow! Fuck, man!

09:53.727 --> 09:56.695
[rap music] [glasses clattering]

10:03.637 --> 10:05.370
            [Rachael]
    Everything okay in here?

10:05.372 --> 10:08.340
What? Oh, it's... No, it's fine.
  It's just the tap, it's only,

10:08.342 --> 10:09.941
         it's only hot.
It's not letting out cold water.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.142
   [Rachael] That's not right.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.143
     I know, it's annoying.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.845
     [Rachael] I'm Rachael.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.647
       [giggles] I'm Bree.
        Nice to meet you.

10:15.649 --> 10:16.681
        And you as well.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.351
  How, how do you know Jordan?

10:20.287 --> 10:22.053
I don't. We just... We just met.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.888
         [Rachael] Cool.
           -But, um...

10:23.890 --> 10:25.156
         I know a couple
   of his work friends and...

10:25.158 --> 10:27.158
    [Rachael chuckles] Yeah?
         -and whatever.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.727
         How about you?
       How do you know J?

10:28.996 --> 10:30.862
     He's my oldest friend,

10:30.864 --> 10:32.998
  but, uh, I don't even fuckin'
   know anyone at this party.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.066
          Where is he?

10:35.268 --> 10:37.102
    He's, uh, in the garage,

10:37.104 --> 10:39.671
     like, pretending to fix
 something, I think. Classic J.

10:42.809 --> 10:43.592
           Oh, is it?

10:43.593 --> 10:44.376
    He's like, he's very
       house-proud, so...

10:44.378 --> 10:46.177
          -That's cute.
  [Rachael] Yeah. It is, yeah.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.879
 He'll be in a minute, I'm sure.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.948
             -Cool.
-Is this your only stop tonight?

10:49.950 --> 10:52.817
   -You headed somewhere else?
       -Uh, I don't know.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.152
            I'll see.
   I guess the night's young.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.687
  I don't work tomorrow, so...

10:57.958 --> 10:59.090
        I fucking just...

10:59.092 --> 11:02.227
   Like, this drives me nuts.
         Like, I hate...

11:02.229 --> 11:04.996
      how this is designed,
   like it's not even broken.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.732
    It's just somebody wasn't
    fuckin' doing their job.

11:07.734 --> 11:09.734
            -Totally.
      -Sorry... [chuckles]

11:09.736 --> 11:11.136
 I don't mean to be an asshole.

11:11.138 --> 11:13.171
 -You're not! Fuck this faucet.
             -Right?

11:13.173 --> 11:14.873
             [both]
        Fuck this faucet!

11:14.875 --> 11:16.875
 [Rachael chuckles] Feels good!
         [Bree giggles]

11:16.877 --> 11:20.278
-Okay. Look. I believe in you...
         -Okay, well...

11:20.280 --> 11:21.913
      Be careful, it's hot.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.051
      [Bree] Is it working?
         [Rachael yelps]

11:26.053 --> 11:27.185
     Okay, cool. Team work.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.820
          [both giggle]

11:29.089 --> 11:30.955
          -Okay, cool.
            -Listen,

11:30.957 --> 11:32.123
   I'll tell Jordan that, uh,
 that he's gotta come find you.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.291
         When I see him.

11:33.694 --> 11:35.160
  Tell him to fix this faucet.

11:35.162 --> 11:37.028
  [Rachael] I'm gonna tell him.
             -Yeah.

11:46.840 --> 11:47.639
         [clears throat]

11:47.640 --> 11:48.439
       What ever happened
      to that doctor thing?

11:48.442 --> 11:51.076
I don't think she was tryna fuck
 with the gas fitter, you know?

11:51.078 --> 11:53.111
     [kisses teeth] Nah, yo.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.246
     They swear they're all
  into that type of thing, yo.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.282
       Like it's all good,
      then they're like...

11:57.284 --> 11:58.917
 "Can you hang these paintings?"

11:59.352 --> 12:00.919
            [unclear]

12:01.488 --> 12:02.987
         I normally just
       fuck up their wall,

12:02.989 --> 12:04.723
 but they ain't tryna hear that.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.391
  Drills, dog. I'm tellin' you.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.159
       Sometimes you don't
        even need drills.

12:08.161 --> 12:11.029
Sometimes you just need good old
    fuckin' man power though,

12:11.031 --> 12:14.165
cause that's what I'm success...
          Ah, you see?

12:14.167 --> 12:15.867
         -Say, where...
          [Nick] Magic!

12:16.203 --> 12:18.336
       This is magic, man.
I'm gonna get this motherfucker,

12:18.338 --> 12:19.904
           I told you.
     I told you that, right?

12:20.040 --> 12:22.073
          I'm gonna get
     this motherfucker, man.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.443
         [Jordan] Okay.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.747
     Yo, you been goin' out
         a lot, though?

12:28.749 --> 12:30.014
       What, like jammin'?

12:30.250 --> 12:31.783
  [Nick] Nah, man, like dates.

12:31.785 --> 12:34.319
         [scoffs] Dates?
       -Yeah, like dates.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.787
      You using those apps?

12:36.456 --> 12:37.489
            I guess.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.824
         They're weird.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.893
       [Nick chuckles] Yo,
 you think Grace is using them?

12:42.162 --> 12:43.762
              Why?

12:43.764 --> 12:47.432
Ah, dog, my boy Philly said that
  he swear he seen her on there

12:47.434 --> 12:48.933
      -at some point. What?
              -Dog!

12:48.935 --> 12:49.801
       I don't wanna hear
      that shit! [chuckles]

12:49.803 --> 12:50.902
           [Nick] Bro!

12:50.904 --> 12:53.872
       It's been pure time
  since you guys broke up, man.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.406
              -And?
    -You bought a crib, dog.

12:55.408 --> 12:58.409
  Yo, don't act like she hasn't
moved on either, please. Please.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.912
     She's doin' all right.
        We still talk.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.182
-You guys still fuckin' or what?
          [Jordan] No!

13:04.184 --> 13:05.917
           [Nick] No?
              -No!

13:05.919 --> 13:08.386
   [Nick] Shorty Bree inside,
      that's the vibes, yo?

13:09.823 --> 13:11.256
    [Jordan] Yeah, I mean...

13:12.058 --> 13:13.458
        Think it could be
a ting with Bree, you know?

13:13.460 --> 13:14.425
          [Nick] Okay.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.395
  It just seems like a process.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.964
 I don't know, man, you pining.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.866
-It's whatever, man. You make...
        [Jordan] No, man.

13:21.868 --> 13:24.969
    It's just macho shit, B.
        Like, she's cool.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.238
           [Nick] Hmm.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.407
   Like, what if I'm breakin'
     a possible relationship

13:29.409 --> 13:30.275
       by just tryna hit?

13:30.277 --> 13:32.443
        If you break it,
       you break it, man.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.279
           Who cares?
   I break a lot of shit, man.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.381
 I'm breakin' all the time, yo.
       It doesn't matter,

13:36.383 --> 13:38.049
         just don't make
       her choice for her.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.517
      Before you even know
       what she wants, yo.

13:40.220 --> 13:43.354
      All I'm sayin', dog,
  all she might want is some D

13:43.356 --> 13:46.124
 and then she might be out, bro.
   [chuckles] That's all, bro.

13:46.126 --> 13:48.026
              Damn!

13:48.028 --> 13:49.360
  [Nick] Yeah, the question is;
      can you handle that?

13:51.131 --> 13:53.264
      -I don't know stuff.
  [Nick] You don't know stuff.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.332
             Well...

13:55.936 --> 13:58.970
         A, you're soft.
       B, you're so soft.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.905
   And C, it's been pure time

14:00.907 --> 14:02.874
 since you broke up with Grace,
              man.

14:02.876 --> 14:05.276
     [Jordan] Eight months?
-Eight months is pure time, bro.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.911
   You know I like Grace, yo.

14:06.913 --> 14:08.513
   If I seen her on the street
        I say, "What up?"

14:08.515 --> 14:11.082
but you gotta stop moving around
  like you been wifed up still.

14:11.218 --> 14:14.252
   -Still feels like it, man.
        -Oh, my God, dog!

14:16.456 --> 14:17.922
         You still sad?

14:20.227 --> 14:23.027
       -Alone, is more...
         [Nick chuckles]

14:23.864 --> 14:25.196
    So you're still sad, man.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.399
         It's... [sighs]

14:28.401 --> 14:30.935
 ...it's more like this feelin'
     of not knowin', like...

14:31.538 --> 14:33.938
  like, how to move, you know?

14:34.174 --> 14:36.174
         Like, even when
        I was with Grace,

14:36.176 --> 14:38.243
      I still holler a ting
      just to see if I can.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.611
              Now?

14:39.613 --> 14:42.213
 I see a ting, I start stressing
        the fuck out, B.

14:42.449 --> 14:43.481
        I gotta be funny.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.450
         Gotta be smart.

14:45.452 --> 14:49.621
   Which I found out, I'm not
   that smart. [Nick chuckles]

14:49.623 --> 14:52.223
      Like the whole thing
  just fucking throws me, man.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.225
     Um, dog, it's like that
         out there, man.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.027
   It's not easy. No one said
       it's gonna be easy.

14:56.029 --> 14:59.230
   [Jordan chuckles] Fuck, B.
          [Nick sighs]

14:59.232 --> 15:01.165
       -I know what it is.
           -We're old.

15:01.167 --> 15:03.034
       No, fuck outta here
      with that horseshit.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.535
        Tired of hearin'
     people say "Old shit".

15:04.537 --> 15:06.671
       We're not old, bro.
    Look at you, look at me.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.374
       [Jordan] We're old
    -No, we're not old, man!

15:09.576 --> 15:11.175
       Seriously, dog. Yo!

15:11.177 --> 15:12.510
    [Nick speaks over Jordan]
      You know what it is?

15:12.512 --> 15:14.612
        Yo, it's because
   when you were with Grace...

15:15.248 --> 15:17.415
  and you came home and you had
  a nice place to come back to

15:17.417 --> 15:19.250
    and you had a shorty that
  was pretty all up in the bed

15:19.252 --> 15:21.085
     and you were set, man,
          that was it.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.355
            So, what,
   you think I made a mistake?

15:25.458 --> 15:26.958
    Nah, man. No, no, no, no.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.192
        I don't think you
      made a mistake, man.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.494
         I'm just sayin'
     I just don't know why,

15:29.496 --> 15:30.929
      that's all, you know?

15:31.665 --> 15:34.265
        Told you, man...
     She just wasn't right.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.101
        What do you mean
         "Wasn't right?"

15:37.103 --> 15:39.003
      She didn't have what
 I wanted her to have, I guess.

15:41.007 --> 15:42.473
 Yeah, well, I get that one, B.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.108
         Uh, Rachael put
   the same thing on me, man.

15:45.679 --> 15:47.345
   That's what it is, though.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.648
   You've got this house idea

15:50.650 --> 15:52.617
    and you thought you were
      gonna get the wife...

15:53.019 --> 15:54.485
 and now you don't got the wife,

15:54.487 --> 15:56.321
     but you got the house,
       which is, you know,

15:56.323 --> 15:57.989
         which is great
   'cause we're drinkin' in it

15:57.991 --> 15:59.524
       and you've already
    fucked up the fucking...

15:59.526 --> 16:01.626
        [Jordan chuckles]
   -...the garage door opener,

16:01.628 --> 16:03.594
 which is just crazy in itself.

16:07.334 --> 16:08.300
    [Nick] You doin' it, man.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.267
       [Jordan] It's like,
     when I was with Grace,

16:09.269 --> 16:12.136
    I could be the messy one,
  like, or, or, the smart one,

16:12.138 --> 16:14.072
   or the busy one, you know?

16:14.274 --> 16:17.008
   Like, there was always this
 checkin' the self against her.

16:18.244 --> 16:19.644
     Yeah, I feel that, man.

16:21.681 --> 16:22.714
         [Jordan] Fuck!

16:23.683 --> 16:28.586
     [garage door rattling]

16:30.623 --> 16:31.556
      And now it's just...

16:31.558 --> 16:35.259
            "Have you
    fucked up today... yet?"

16:36.229 --> 16:38.363
   [Nick scoffs] Already, bro.
        [Jordan] I know.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.999
     -House-warmin', right?
   -Yeah, you wanna go inside?

16:41.201 --> 16:42.600
      [Jordan] Not really.
          [Nick] Good.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.302
     'Cause I don't either.
             This...

16:44.304 --> 16:46.104
  Don't know anybody in there.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.039
    You the only motherfucker
 I know, so pass me the Philips

16:48.041 --> 16:49.607
'cause I'm gonna fix this thing.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.542
    And you can keep talkin'
    'cause I'm gonna listen.

16:51.544 --> 16:53.578
  I'm a multi-tasker like that,
     bro, that's what I do.

16:53.580 --> 16:54.746
      It's magic, you know?

16:57.050 --> 16:58.282
    It, it's like... [sighs]

16:58.651 --> 17:00.485
           ...I know,
  like, I'm not very different,

17:00.487 --> 17:03.021
    you know what I'm sayin'?
   Like, I'm, I'm the same J,

17:03.023 --> 17:05.056
     -same Jordan. Same guy.
         [Nick chuckles]

17:05.058 --> 17:06.391
             -Yeah.
   [Jordan] You know? Like...

17:06.393 --> 17:08.226
   -You the only man I know...
         [Jordan] But...

17:08.228 --> 17:09.394
      ...is gonna complain
          about a ting

17:09.396 --> 17:10.728
 that wants to smash right now.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.497
     It's not even a bother,

17:12.499 --> 17:15.032
      now I just feel like
  I'm too self-aware, you know?

17:15.035 --> 17:16.034
             Like...

17:16.036 --> 17:18.803
        I know what kind
     of girl I should, like,

17:18.805 --> 17:22.073
     Like, what kind of girl
    should like me. You know?

17:22.776 --> 17:25.076
   [Nick] Fuck. Tell me, man.

17:27.079 --> 17:27.811
        What do you mean?

17:27.814 --> 17:30.381
        Tell me who I am
       and tell me who...

17:31.117 --> 17:32.517
    and tell me who you are.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.485
    [Nick] Tell me who I am.
      -Nah, nah, nah, nah.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.155
            Why not?

17:37.457 --> 17:40.191
          I don't know.
  It's... bad form or whatever.

17:40.326 --> 17:42.393
   Nah, man, it's just us fam.

17:44.164 --> 17:47.298
           All right.
     I'm... half-way smart.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.100
         [Nick chuckles]
           -Observant.

17:50.136 --> 17:51.369
    I heard I'm good lookin'.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.337
   Fuck outta here. [mumbling]

17:53.339 --> 17:55.406
 [Jordan chuckles] You asked, B.
         [Nick chuckles]

17:55.809 --> 17:57.708
      -I'm co-dependent...
           [Nick] Hmm.

17:58.445 --> 18:03.081
 selfish. Judgy. Drink too much.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.650
       I'm a great dancer.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.652
   -You know what I'm sayin'?
   [Nick chuckles] Yeah, yeah.

18:07.821 --> 18:10.755
 And who do you think you still
co-dependent with? Grace though?

18:10.757 --> 18:14.125
        Nah. My mom. You.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.461
       Probably goin' on,
       like ten years now.

18:16.463 --> 18:17.862
        You don't notice?

18:17.864 --> 18:18.863
         [Nick chuckles]
   How can you be co-dependent

18:18.865 --> 18:20.598
with someone you don't even see?

18:20.600 --> 18:23.334
-Get outta here 'bout never see.
       -Oh, trust me, man.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.837
 Real shit, yo. I was surprised
     when I get invited, yo.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.639
   [Nick] Honestly, I thought
you had this place for a minute.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.109
   When I got the invite, man,
     I was, like, "Wow", yo.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.678
          Look around.
     None of 'em right here.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.313
      I sent e-vites, man.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.415
      Don't feed me talkin'
       'bout e-vites, dog.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.250
What the fuck is a "e-vite", yo?

18:39.252 --> 18:40.418
   -It's an imaginary invite.
   [Jordan] It's an invitation

18:40.420 --> 18:41.686
         -to your email.
        -Don't... [tuts]

18:41.688 --> 18:43.321
        ...don't tease me
         with dat ting.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.522
          [Jordan] E...
   -I swear you talkin' about

18:44.524 --> 18:46.357
         undefined, yo.

18:46.359 --> 18:47.592
     You always been tryin'
      to do the same thing,

18:47.594 --> 18:48.826
  but in high school was just,

18:48.828 --> 18:50.561
            you know,
     it was just Jordan, yo.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.463
        Always down, dog.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.399
     You went to university,
            you know?

18:55.401 --> 18:56.667
   Mazz didn't see you no more

18:56.669 --> 18:57.835
             or Mazz
     wasn't linkin' anybody.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.537
 You didn't check Mazz, really.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.305
     And then you come back
     every once in a while,

19:01.307 --> 19:02.673
           and you had
like a girl in town or somethin'

19:02.675 --> 19:04.876
     you bring 'em through,

19:04.878 --> 19:06.577
 have a couple drinks and you go
 south with the girl still, man.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.646
 I wasn't livin' in the city, B!

19:08.648 --> 19:11.215
We never see you, man. You know?

19:11.217 --> 19:12.650
        You know one man
     I might be able to say

19:12.652 --> 19:14.685
who got your little e-vite ting.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.654
Got your e-vite, checked it out,

19:16.656 --> 19:18.589
       then scroll through
   his phone and text you back

19:18.591 --> 19:20.324
          to see where
     he could text you from

19:20.326 --> 19:22.293
  or the last time he text you.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.728
  You know what? Actually, I'm,
  I'm gonna tell you who it is.

19:23.730 --> 19:26.597
          Randell, yo.
 Randell out of all people, yo.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.634
  Then next man starts saying,
   "Yo, let me check my phone

19:29.636 --> 19:31.469
        last time J tried
      to holler at me, man.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.204
            I hit you
    a couple weeks ago, man.

19:33.206 --> 19:34.872
      Yeah, you, you hit me
      a couple of weeks ago

19:34.874 --> 19:36.407
  'bout your water heater, dog.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.376
        That's more than
     I link most people, B.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.211
        Yo, first it's me
     with the water heater,

19:40.213 --> 19:41.579
  next man lookin' at his phone

19:41.581 --> 19:43.381
   it's like a year and a half
    since you talked to him.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.516
    Next is two years.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.884
      Then Randell, Randell
   scrollin' though his phone

19:46.886 --> 19:48.753
 and say yo, trust me, Randell,

19:48.755 --> 19:50.721
        You know Randell.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.657
 Randell maybe you fuckin' high
     now, man... [chuckles]

19:52.659 --> 19:53.958
    ...but you trippin' out.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.426
          But I seen it
     with my own eyes, man.

19:55.428 --> 19:56.861
           Four years.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.863
      Four years since you
     talked to Randell, man.

19:59.499 --> 20:00.865
   It's not like he linked me.

20:01.267 --> 20:02.533
        Yo, and I thought
        about that, man,

20:02.535 --> 20:04.235
     and then I said, like,
        "Don't get mad."

20:04.237 --> 20:06.270
    But then I looked around,
      we're all here, man.

20:06.272 --> 20:07.538
         I'm still here.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.873
  No, man, you're not here, yo.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.508
            You stuck
  in your cool-guy bubble, yo.

20:10.510 --> 20:11.709
            What, yo?

20:11.878 --> 20:13.511
    Yeah, man, it's whatever.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.413
       You got your house,
    you got a girl, you know?

20:15.415 --> 20:17.448
       You got your tings,
        you got your job.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.950
  You know, you got everything
        set for you, man,

20:18.952 --> 20:20.551
   that's what you were about.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.353
   -That's who you are about.
        -Are you serious?

20:22.355 --> 20:24.255
    The mandem can't fault me
     for tryna do somethin'!

20:24.424 --> 20:26.757
          I had a wife.
      I had a fuckin' job.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.459

 -I see Rachael's in town, man.
     -Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:09.362 --> 22:11.629
         All right, yo.
 So, uh, is she coming through?

22:11.631 --> 22:12.663
              Yeah.

22:13.466 --> 22:14.999
       -All right, well...
          -You guys...

22:15.501 --> 22:17.768
  She said you guys were cool.
     You good? Is that true?

22:17.770 --> 22:19.970
     Yeah, we're good, man.
  Yeah, we're good, we're good.

22:19.972 --> 22:21.472
       [Jordan] All right.

22:21.474 --> 22:22.740
     When was the last time
        you spoke to her?

22:23.042 --> 22:24.942
 Sound like a couple years ago,
             still.

22:24.944 --> 22:26.777
             -Yeah?
    [Nick] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.079
              Shit!

22:28.448 --> 22:29.980
      -I didn't know that.
  [Nick] Nah, we good, though.

22:29.982 --> 22:30.848
           -You sure?
           -Yeah, man.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.650
           We're good.

22:32.652 --> 22:33.751
     You want me to call her
       and see if she's...

22:33.753 --> 22:35.086
               No.
      You go do your thing.

22:35.088 --> 22:37.388
     Yo, let's go. Let's go.

22:37.957 --> 22:39.557
We're good, man, trust me.

22:39.559 --> 22:40.991
      -Trust me, trust me.
       [Jordan] All right.

22:41.527 --> 22:42.927
           -You sure?
        [Nick] Yeah, man.

22:43.062 --> 22:44.695
    I'll be back, sweetheart.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.630
          [party music]
  [Chris] Hey, man, what's up?

22:46.632 --> 22:48.065
              -Yo.
    [Chris] How're you doin'?

22:48.067 --> 22:49.633
           -I'm so...
  -I've seen a really hot girl,

22:49.635 --> 22:51.369
   I want to get her a drink.
       So I need a glass.

22:51.371 --> 22:52.737
      Where's the glasses?

22:52.739 --> 22:53.938
      -On the party table.
    -Those are plastic cups.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.106
 Talkin' about like a real cup.

22:55.108 --> 22:56.607
     I don't live here dude.

22:56.609 --> 22:57.675
          I don't know
     where the glasses are.

22:57.677 --> 22:59.110
     Get off your high horse

22:59.112 --> 23:00.644
      and help me find out
    if he's got a salad bowl.

23:00.646 --> 23:01.812
          You still on
   about the salad bowl thing?

23:01.814 --> 23:03.414
  Well, it's my gift! I'm not,

23:03.416 --> 23:04.749
      I'm not gonna buy him
       a salad bowl if...

23:04.751 --> 23:06.016
   [Chris] She wants a drink,
         I need a glass.

23:06.018 --> 23:06.884
        -Where are they?
      -I don't know, dude!

23:06.886 --> 23:08.552
          [Chris sighs]

23:08.688 --> 23:10.521
         He's got beets,
   so you know he loves salad.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.624
         -This is, uh...
   -That looks like a relish.

23:13.793 --> 23:15.860
    -Is this what relish is?
     [Chris whispers] Yeah.

23:15.862 --> 23:18.763
 Man, can we find glasses, man.
     I need to find glasses.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.632
     I just think if no one,
like, if no one's bought him it,

23:21.634 --> 23:23.801
then I don't think he has one...
          -Salad bowl!

23:23.803 --> 23:25.936
       -That works, right?
     -This is a mixing bowl.

23:25.938 --> 23:27.738
  What's the difference between
     salad and mixing bowls?

23:27.740 --> 23:30.040
  It's got a more narrow mouth.
     You need a wider mouth

23:30.042 --> 23:31.475
 or else the leaves aren't going
     to be able to breathe.

23:31.477 --> 23:33.043
   Wider... Okay. Sure. Fine.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.712
  It's salad, it's not a joke.

23:34.714 --> 23:36.147
  [Chris] Hey! I'm not... Okay.
        [Crossland sighs]

23:36.149 --> 23:37.515
   [Chris] Are these glasses?

23:37.517 --> 23:39.417
    No, but I honestly think
            that if,

23:39.419 --> 23:41.018
     as long as no one else,
 like, brought him it as a gift,

23:41.020 --> 23:42.153
             I think
    he's gonna love it, dude.

23:42.155 --> 23:43.821
     Oh, I can get him cups!

23:43.823 --> 23:45.089
     -You can get him cups!
      [Chris] There you go!

23:45.091 --> 23:46.690
       -You get him cups.
             -Done.

23:46.692 --> 23:48.125
      [Crossland] I get him
         a salad bowl...

23:48.127 --> 23:49.794
 [Chris] You work with the guy,
       I give them to you,

23:49.796 --> 23:51.162
     -you take them to work.
    -I'll bring them to work.

23:51.164 --> 23:52.196
              -Done
   -He bikes to work, though.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.564
  How am I gonna get it to him?

23:53.566 --> 23:56.500
        Shit! Okay. Uh...

23:56.502 --> 23:58.035
      That's not our fault.

23:58.037 --> 23:59.970
       -I mean, it's not.
 [Crossland] That's his choice.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.472
  -It's his choice. [chuckles]
     -That's his own choice.

24:01.474 --> 24:02.940
        Kind of funny...

24:02.942 --> 24:04.708
       Picturing him with
  a fuckin' salad bowl tryna...

24:04.710 --> 24:06.610
    -And glasses biking home.
      -That's as worth it,

24:06.612 --> 24:08.579
     -That's worth it to me.
        [Chris chuckles]

24:09.615 --> 24:11.015
      [Rachael] All right.
   [Jordan] I think I'm gonna

24:11.017 --> 24:12.950
    -make it a studio, but...
      [Rachael] Oh, my God!

24:12.952 --> 24:15.119
 -...for now it's just a garage.
       -Holy shit, Jordan!

24:15.121 --> 24:17.955
             -Yeah!
              -Wow!

24:18.991 --> 24:20.057
              Wow!

24:21.127 --> 24:23.027
      It's nuts. [chuckles]

24:23.029 --> 24:25.529
What do you mean "nuts", though?
 You mean like it's a bad thing?

24:25.865 --> 24:28.666
          No, not bad.
 It's like... A decent decision.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.935
 Yeah... You don't want a house?

24:31.137 --> 24:33.771
        -I do... One day.
            -Me too.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.139
       And, now I have it.

24:35.141 --> 24:36.907
   [Rachael chuckles] You do!
        [Jordan chuckles]

24:36.909 --> 24:38.242
          Already, eh?

24:39.745 --> 24:42.012
            -Yeah...
   -Nick mentioned it inside.

24:43.749 --> 24:44.849
          How was that?

24:44.851 --> 24:46.951
    [Rachael] Oh, seeing him?

24:46.953 --> 24:48.719
             -Yeah.
   [Rachael] Uh, it was okay.

24:49.155 --> 24:52.089
   -It was... a little weird.
            -Yeah...

24:52.892 --> 24:54.959
[Rachael] It was a little weird.
     -He looks good, right?

24:54.961 --> 24:57.928
       [Rachael chuckles]
      Yeah, he looks good.

24:57.930 --> 25:00.264
         -You tryna hit?
     -No, I'm not tryna hit.

25:00.266 --> 25:02.066
         [Jordan laughs]
        [Rachael giggles]

25:02.068 --> 25:03.767
          [Rachael] No!
-I didn't know it'd been so long

25:03.769 --> 25:05.603
         since you guys
       had spoken, though.

25:05.872 --> 25:09.540
      Has it been... long?
  I don't think it's been long.

25:09.542 --> 25:11.041
        What... How long
       did he say it was?

25:11.244 --> 25:12.843
     -Two years. What it...
           -Two years?

25:12.845 --> 25:14.945
   -It hasn't been two years?
      -That's so fucked up!

25:14.947 --> 25:16.914
      I fucking hate that,
       hate that so much!

25:16.916 --> 25:18.749
   'Cause it's a blatant lie.
       It's been a month.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.818
       -Two months, tops.
  [Jordan chuckles] Seriously?

25:20.820 --> 25:24.221
   [Rachael giggling] It has.
     -That's fuckin' weird.

25:24.924 --> 25:27.892
        -You want a beer?
 [Rachael] No, I'm good, thanks.

25:28.794 --> 25:30.828
  [Rachael] What is this thing?
      [Jordan] You drivin'?

25:32.598 --> 25:33.614
      No, I'm not driving.

25:33.615 --> 25:34.631
  [giggling] But you're driving
      a fucking motorcycle.

25:34.634 --> 25:35.966
     Don't worry about that!

25:35.968 --> 25:38.068
          -What's this?
    -I was reading something.

25:38.070 --> 25:41.238
          What are you?
A fucking dad in midlife crisis?

25:42.074 --> 25:44.608
        Jesus! [chuckles]

25:44.610 --> 25:45.876
 Where'd you come off with that?

25:45.878 --> 25:48.112
      Do you have to search
       through everything?

25:48.781 --> 25:50.714
       -I'm very curious.
  -Look, that's not the point.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.683
         [Rachael] Okay.
    -Why aren't you drinking?

25:53.286 --> 25:55.185
     -I'm just not drinking.
         -You pregnant?

25:55.187 --> 25:59.323
    No! Fuck, no! I hope not.
   I'm just like, I'm... not.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.892
          God. But why?

26:01.894 --> 26:03.160
       Well... [stammers]

26:03.162 --> 26:04.995
     'Cause when I got back
           to the city

26:04.997 --> 26:06.564
 I was drinking a lot and I was
   going out with those girls

26:06.566 --> 26:07.565
       that you don't like

26:07.567 --> 26:09.033
           -and, uh...
             -True.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.001
      And then I just took
    a month off to get right.

26:11.837 --> 26:13.771
I needed to see if I could do it
       and I could do it,

26:13.773 --> 26:15.105
       which was so crazy.

26:15.107 --> 26:17.041
          And it was...
      Yeah, it was amazing.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.742
  It was, like, I was suddenly
   getting all this shit done.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.010
       And not just work.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.178
      I was getting, like,
         fun shit done.

26:21.180 --> 26:22.780
   I was doin' fun shit again.

26:22.782 --> 26:24.882
       I went to a fuckin'
     matinee on a Saturday.

26:24.884 --> 26:27.084
       Like, you lose half
  of your weekend to hangovers,

26:27.086 --> 26:28.652
      -you get that, right?
           -Naturally.

26:28.821 --> 26:31.322
     So, Saturday and Sunday
    are part of my life now.

26:31.324 --> 26:33.591
  -And it's really nice. Yeah!
             -Yeah?

26:33.859 --> 26:35.225
         -That's crazy.
          -It is crazy!

26:35.227 --> 26:36.894
  Like, not even on occasions?

26:36.896 --> 26:38.762
      No, I can't remember
     the last time I've had

26:38.764 --> 26:39.830
      more than two drinks.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.098
              Nah!

26:41.300 --> 26:43.233
        I swear I've been
    drinkin' with you a bunch

26:43.235 --> 26:45.135
    -in the last two months.
  [Rachael] You really haven't.

26:45.137 --> 26:46.971
 'Cause I'll stop at two drinks

26:46.973 --> 26:48.973
 and then I switch to soda water
       and no one notices.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.908
         [Jordan] Word!
            -Mmm-hmm.

26:51.744 --> 26:53.677
   [Jordan] That sounds good.
        -It's very good.

26:54.180 --> 26:55.279
       You should try it.

26:56.382 --> 26:58.649
            -Yeah...
         [Rachael] What?

26:58.651 --> 26:59.984
    I don't know if I could.

26:59.986 --> 27:02.019
   You could totally do it...
           You could.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.754
       Here's the thought
     that really helped me.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.389
             -Okay.
    -I realized that drinking

27:05.391 --> 27:07.091
was just, like, this punctuation

27:07.093 --> 27:09.660
  for everything that happened
 in my life. So, it was like...

27:09.662 --> 27:11.328
      Great thing happens.
        Exclamation mark.

27:11.330 --> 27:12.997
          Drink. Um...

27:12.999 --> 27:15.833
     Um, big life decision.
      Question mark. Drink?

27:16.068 --> 27:18.636
           [stammers]
  Long day over. Period. Drink.

27:19.705 --> 27:25.209
 Ahh, like... I got time between
  now and my next thing. Drink.

27:25.211 --> 27:26.777
     [giggling] Yeah. Yeah.
         [Jordan] Okay.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.779
   Um, uh, my life's changing.
             Drink.

27:28.781 --> 27:31.949
   -My life's changing. Drink.
            -Exactly.

27:31.951 --> 27:34.785
       -I bought a house!
 [Rachael] You did buy a house.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.120
          [Jordan] Hmm.
        -Yeah! [giggling]

27:36.122 --> 27:37.755
     It's a very nice house.

27:38.924 --> 27:40.924
    [Jordan] Thank you.
    [Rachael] You're welcome.

27:43.929 --> 27:45.062
       You talk to Grace?

27:45.064 --> 27:48.399
 [Rachael] Uh, yeah. She's fine.
        -That's good.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.971
   [Rachael] Think she's like,
 surprised you bought the house.

27:54.106 --> 27:55.439
    She might be a little mad
            about it.

27:55.441 --> 27:56.740
         She can be mad.

27:56.742 --> 28:00.978
  No, you don't want a mad ex.
 You want a happy ex, trust me.

28:01.113 --> 28:03.080
         You really do.
       'Cause it's like...

28:03.883 --> 28:06.450
       All those years of,
    like, fucking bullshit...

28:07.253 --> 28:09.053
     I just want it to mean
        something, right?

28:09.288 --> 28:11.755
 Maybe it's a bit selfish, but,
   like, I wanna leave my mark

28:11.757 --> 28:12.890
      and know that, uh...

28:12.892 --> 28:15.325
        they're not gonna
   forget about you, you know?

28:15.761 --> 28:16.794
          I don't know.

28:17.163 --> 28:18.862
        You surprised?

28:18.864 --> 28:21.065
      I was not surprised.
You talked about it for so long.

28:21.067 --> 28:25.102
   Like... I don't believe in
     soulmates and all that,

28:25.104 --> 28:28.005
      so I, I didn't think
     you were that, but I...

28:29.008 --> 28:31.141
    I just didn't think you'd
  actually go through with it.

28:33.079 --> 28:34.045
             And...

28:34.046 --> 28:35.012
not that much has changed since.

28:35.314 --> 28:36.980
   Yeah, that's it, you know?

28:36.982 --> 28:39.183
     Like, I keep expecting,
        like this shift.

28:39.185 --> 28:41.251
        Like, within me.

28:42.288 --> 28:43.887
 And, like, nothing's happened.

28:44.090 --> 28:44.955
             Like...

28:46.492 --> 28:48.425
  like, I don't know if that's
       a reflection of me

28:48.427 --> 28:49.960
   or the relationship, but...

28:51.130 --> 28:52.830
       Like, I wanna think
          that I'm this

28:52.832 --> 28:54.298
 different guy than when we met.

28:55.134 --> 28:56.500
But there's no proof of that.

28:57.303 --> 28:58.769
 Except you buying this house...

28:59.872 --> 29:00.871
             Yeah...

29:01.207 --> 29:02.740
        Uh... oh, my God!

29:02.742 --> 29:04.308
     [upbeat music] [sighs]

29:04.310 --> 29:05.909
    How doesn't he have cups?

29:06.145 --> 29:07.811
        She's waiting...

29:07.813 --> 29:09.012
       Chill the fuck out.
         He's got cups.

29:09.014 --> 29:10.380
         Just 'cause you
       don't like the cups

29:10.382 --> 29:11.982
          doesn't mean
      he doesn't have cups

29:11.984 --> 29:13.317
    I mean, what's the point?
        Am I goin' crazy?

29:13.319 --> 29:14.952
      Like, how do you host
      a party without cups?

29:14.954 --> 29:16.286
        Without a variety
    of cups for your guests?

29:16.288 --> 29:17.888
      Do you hear yourself?

29:17.890 --> 29:19.056
     Are people drinkin' out
         of their palms?

29:19.058 --> 29:20.758
        They're drinkin'
      out of the red cups.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.794
    [Chris] Dude, the red cup
    screams "roofie-colada."

29:23.796 --> 29:26.764
 I wanna give her a clear glass
    and so I'm approachable.

29:26.766 --> 29:28.799
   It screams "roofie-colada"
      if you give it to her

29:28.801 --> 29:30.334
     with those eyes, dude.
           Calm down.

29:30.336 --> 29:32.936
  He's got cups! He's got cups,
    you just don't like them.

29:32.938 --> 29:34.238
      That's not his fault.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.106
    Do you think he's hosting
          many parties?

29:36.108 --> 29:37.207
 What else would he have hosted?

29:37.209 --> 29:38.842
You don't think this is a party?

29:38.844 --> 29:40.544
        I think he's more
   used to the barbeque thing.

29:40.546 --> 29:42.880
         -To be honest.
            -In what?

29:42.882 --> 29:44.181
        [Chris] Barbeques

29:44.183 --> 29:45.949
      Why'd he have hosted
         more barbeques?

29:45.951 --> 29:47.551
       Oh, you think I...?

29:47.553 --> 29:49.453
 No, I just meant 'cause he had,
    he's got a big back deck.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.855
  It's, like, sort of conducive
          to barbeques.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.159
           [Crossland]
    There's cups right here.

29:55.161 --> 29:56.360
          [Chris] Shit!
      -There's a shitload.

29:56.362 --> 29:57.394
        [Chris] Mad cups!

29:57.396 --> 29:59.029
       [Chris] Thank you.

29:59.031 --> 30:00.564
   Oh, she's gonna love this!
       Look at this! See?

30:00.566 --> 30:03.066
         That, that says
 "I'm a nice guy, I have a job."

30:03.068 --> 30:05.569
        I feel like this,
 I feel like this screams "me".

30:05.971 --> 30:07.571
 I just, I don't seek out dates.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.807
    I don't think that that's
something I that want right now.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.942
   I know that's not something
        I want right now.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.277
           Commitment?

30:13.913 --> 30:15.946
          -Obligation.
             -Right.

30:16.182 --> 30:18.148
        But I have, like,
         my roster dudes

30:18.284 --> 30:21.084
    and they'll, like, go out
   and have fun when I want to

30:21.086 --> 30:22.986
       and I can get mine
         when I need to.

30:23.122 --> 30:24.121
              So...

30:24.123 --> 30:26.223
   [Jordan] That sounds great.
        -It is great.

30:26.458 --> 30:29.092
       It's great... Yeah.

30:32.498 --> 30:34.064
    How you dealin' with it?

30:34.567 --> 30:37.868
  -Not well. Just lost. Naked.
       [Rachael chuckles]

30:38.204 --> 30:41.004
   [Jordan] Pitch black. Lost.
             -Good.

30:41.006 --> 30:42.372
    -Great time for a party.
         [Jordan] Right?

30:42.374 --> 30:45.008
          [both laugh]

30:45.010 --> 30:47.211
         Like, I thought
     I was ready, you know?

30:47.213 --> 30:48.579
            -Uh-huh.
     -That I've been layin'

30:48.581 --> 30:50.414
       an emotional track
       for the last year.

30:51.016 --> 30:52.549
          I even tried
    to cultivate a few tings

30:52.551 --> 30:54.885
     -for when it happened.
     -What happened to 'em?

30:54.887 --> 30:56.486
      They all fell in love
       with other people.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.989
          -It happens.
          -Yeah. To me.

30:59.592 --> 31:02.292
   [Rachael giggles] Not just
to you. It happens to everybody.

31:02.294 --> 31:03.560
       That shit happens.

31:04.363 --> 31:07.364
       You're not special.
    I know that hurts, but...

31:07.366 --> 31:09.132
           -Thank you.
   -I know it's hard to hear.

31:09.134 --> 31:11.101
         But the minute
    you fuckin' realize that

31:11.103 --> 31:14.171
you'll realize it's probably not
gonna work out, most things end,

31:14.173 --> 31:16.006
 so just fucking do it anyways.

31:16.008 --> 31:17.341
     Have you fucked anyone?

31:17.343 --> 31:18.909
             -Nope.
            -Why not?

31:19.445 --> 31:21.445
     [Jordan] I don't know.
      -How long's it been?

31:22.381 --> 31:24.348
-I don't know. Like, six months.
        -Everybody knows.

31:24.350 --> 31:29.620
  Ooh, come on! Why six months?
   What about the girl inside?

31:29.622 --> 31:31.488
           -Who? Bree?
            -I guess.

31:32.024 --> 31:34.291
         We got like...
    heavy flirtin' goin' on.

31:34.293 --> 31:36.360
 Okay, so you're foolin' around?
               No.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.329
     Why do that? [chuckles]
      Why enjoy your life?

31:39.331 --> 31:41.932
        -No, it's just...
             -What?

31:43.102 --> 31:44.568
       I don't know, I...

31:46.939 --> 31:48.472
        she's so pretty.

31:48.607 --> 31:50.107
  What the fuck does that mean?

31:50.609 --> 31:53.443
    I mean... Look... [sighs]

31:54.313 --> 31:56.046
     Grace was pretty and...

31:56.548 --> 31:59.283
         Oh, that's so,
    I'm so sorry for you.

31:59.285 --> 32:01.418
   Why don't you fuck someone
     that you actually like?

32:01.420 --> 32:04.254
   Would, would that be awful?
        Is that so scary?

32:04.256 --> 32:06.690
         To, like, yeah!
  Like, you like a pretty girl.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.592
        And she wants to,
         to be with you.

32:08.594 --> 32:09.693
  That's such fucking bullshit!

32:09.695 --> 32:12.062
     I just can't imagine...

32:12.398 --> 32:14.631
         actually having
      to convince somebody

32:14.633 --> 32:16.967
  -to have sex with me, again.
        [Rachael grunts]

32:17.536 --> 32:20.137
     -Like, all over again.
        -I don't know...

32:21.307 --> 32:23.106
      -I think, I... What?
              -I...

32:24.043 --> 32:25.309
     I had such a good run.

32:26.178 --> 32:27.511
    Yeah, you had a good run

32:27.513 --> 32:29.313
         and now you're
      an eligible bachelor,

32:29.315 --> 32:31.682
          with a house,
  so just fuck someone. Anyone.

32:31.684 --> 32:33.283
  It doesn't matter who it is.

32:33.519 --> 32:34.651
     You're edging yourself.

32:34.653 --> 32:36.353
       -What do you mean?
             -Okay.

32:36.355 --> 32:38.155
      You know when you're,
        like, fucking or,

32:38.157 --> 32:39.656
     or you're jerking off,
          or whatever,

32:39.658 --> 32:41.692
    and you're about to come,
 so you do those Kegel exercises

32:41.694 --> 32:43.627
     to, like, stop yourself
        from coming, yes?

32:43.629 --> 32:45.662
  And then you sweat a little,
    you do it all over again

32:45.664 --> 32:47.230
        and you're, like,
     at the edge of coming,

32:47.232 --> 32:50.600
you're at the fuckin' windowsill
          of coming...

32:50.970 --> 32:52.002
              -Ohh.
             -Right?

32:52.004 --> 32:53.270
How am I explaining this to you?

32:53.272 --> 32:54.738
        Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
         Edging. Edging.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.540
The suicide metaphor is telling.

32:56.542 --> 32:58.208
   Suicide? You said suicide.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.543
       You could be, like,
          I don't know,

32:59.545 --> 33:01.345
       escaping the hazard
     of a lover on vacation.

33:01.547 --> 33:04.014
     -Oh, yeah. That's true.
             -Right?

33:04.016 --> 33:05.248
     Yeah, that's your life.

33:05.517 --> 33:07.050
       I think I'm scared.

33:07.386 --> 33:09.419
    Of course, you're scared.
      You should be scared.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.021
      It's a little scary.

33:11.023 --> 33:13.523
      I've had one person's
     pubic hairs in my mouth

33:13.525 --> 33:15.392
   -for the last seven years.
             -Right.

33:15.394 --> 33:18.495
 Like one back that likes to be
      rubbed a certain way.

33:19.131 --> 33:21.431
   One level of ticklish that
    wasn't able to be crossed

33:21.433 --> 33:22.566
   but was able to be reached.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.634
          Yeah... Fuck!

33:24.636 --> 33:26.103
       It's totally fair.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.072
 It is. And that's real life, J.

33:29.408 --> 33:31.241
      But, you're a catch,

33:31.243 --> 33:33.377
         so why not just
      have sex with a girl

33:33.379 --> 33:34.745
 who wants to have sex with you?

33:35.614 --> 33:36.613
         [Jordan scoffs]

33:38.083 --> 33:39.216
          Have you seen
       the bed in my room?

33:39.418 --> 33:40.517
             Yeah...

33:41.053 --> 33:42.652
        It's the same bed
        me and Grace had.

33:44.089 --> 33:47.324
    I swear I can' even sleep
 in the middle of it. It's huge!

33:47.559 --> 33:49.092
     It's an expensive bed!

33:49.094 --> 33:50.727
             -Okay.
   -I shouldn't get rid of it,

33:50.729 --> 33:53.030
   but I take up like a sixth
          of the thing.

33:53.399 --> 33:54.664
 The rest of it just taunts me.

33:55.134 --> 33:56.366
           Oh, my God!

33:56.568 --> 33:58.468
  -You have to stop with this.
         [Jordan sighs]

33:58.470 --> 33:59.770
        You have to stop!

33:59.772 --> 34:01.405
      Did you rehearse that
         in your sleep?

34:01.740 --> 34:03.340
  You're being a fuckin' pussy.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.042
        -You really are.
         -What the fuck?

34:05.044 --> 34:06.510
        What do you mean,
        "What the fuck"?

34:06.512 --> 34:08.277
     I'm your oldest friend!
   If I can't say this to you,

34:08.280 --> 34:09.679
        then no one can.
  You're being a fucking pussy.

34:09.681 --> 34:12.181
     You chose to leave your
    girlfriend of many years,

34:12.184 --> 34:13.483
  so why don't you fucking sit

34:13.485 --> 34:15.318
         in that choice
       for a second, okay?

34:15.320 --> 34:18.388
Sit in how uncomfortable that is
    and try and do something

34:18.389 --> 34:19.556
        -and get over it.
            -I have!

34:19.558 --> 34:21.425
        You haven't done
        a fucking thing!

34:21.427 --> 34:23.260
     You haven't, and I know
  you want me to be empathetic,

34:23.262 --> 34:24.694
and I really am, and I love you,

34:25.097 --> 34:27.597
     but you just sit there
 tryna rationalize this choice.

34:28.167 --> 34:30.167
   And you try to rationalize

34:30.168 --> 34:31.534
   if you should get in touch
        with her or not,

34:31.536 --> 34:33.637
       which, oh, my God,
she told me that you're, like...

34:34.440 --> 34:36.172
That you contacted her and asked

34:36.175 --> 34:38.208
       if you should stay
  on the family plan together.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.743
         -It's cheaper!
      -It's so fuckin' dumb

34:39.745 --> 34:41.511
   and it's an excuse to say,

34:41.513 --> 34:43.280
         to stay sitting
       in this other thing

34:43.282 --> 34:44.781
 instead of just moving forward.

34:45.451 --> 34:48.150
   You have to stop that shit.
            You do...

34:48.152 --> 34:50.387
          So, set me up
   with some of your friends.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.389
      [chuckles] I do that!

34:52.391 --> 34:56.259
 And you fuckin' dance with them
   and then you go home alone.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.361
             -Oh...
    -It's a really sad image.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.233
            -Yeah...
   -You know Sharon was down?

35:03.569 --> 35:05.102
        The lawyer ting?

35:05.270 --> 35:07.104
       [Rachael chuckles]
        Yes, the lawyer.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.206
          I liked her.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.607
             Right.
    You should've kissed her.

35:11.110 --> 35:12.809
         -That's a move.
            -Really?

35:12.811 --> 35:16.113
             -Sure.
-That's not like... threatening?

35:16.582 --> 35:18.281
Do you think you're threatening?

35:18.283 --> 35:20.817
           I mean, no.
    Not at all, but, like...

35:20.819 --> 35:23.820
   I read all this stuff about
 how guys can be so threatening.

35:24.623 --> 35:28.225
      I guess that's not...
        uh, untrue, but,

35:28.227 --> 35:30.427
    like, getting introduced
         by your friend,

35:30.729 --> 35:32.462
       dilutes the danger

35:32.464 --> 35:35.132
    and dancing for two hours
  dilutes that, as well, so...

35:37.569 --> 35:39.903
  -Another question. All right.
             -Okay.

35:39.905 --> 35:41.671
You know, I'm gonna get a drink.

35:41.673 --> 35:44.708
  [Jordan chuckles] So... Okay!
    [Rachael chuckles] Okay.

35:45.777 --> 35:47.444
          -It's my one.
             -Yeah?

35:47.446 --> 35:49.279
          -That's fine.
         [Rachael] Okay.

35:49.414 --> 35:52.849
  All right. So... You walkin'
   down the street, all right?

35:52.851 --> 35:54.284
      [Rachael] Sure. Yeah.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.486
      You see a guy walkin'
       'long the street...

35:56.755 --> 35:57.687
         Well dressed...

35:57.689 --> 36:00.323
      -mildly good looking.
         [Rachael] Okay.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.292
         -All right. Me.
      -It's you. [chuckles]

36:02.294 --> 36:04.628
-It's me, but you don't know me.
       [Rachael] I got it.

36:04.630 --> 36:05.695
         [Jordan] Right?

36:05.697 --> 36:08.899
  Stops walkin' in the opposite
   direction and says, "Hey!"

36:09.835 --> 36:11.434
       [Rachael chuckles]

36:11.436 --> 36:13.870
   "Why don't we have a drink?
          You and me?"

36:13.872 --> 36:15.872
        [chuckling] What?
   Why the fuck is he yelling,

36:15.874 --> 36:17.307
      is my first thought.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.409
   You're using a lot of this.

36:19.411 --> 36:21.578
         I think you can
       do more with less.

36:22.447 --> 36:23.680
          First of all,
     what time of day is it?

36:23.682 --> 36:25.248
 -Like, the scene that you're...
            -Evening.

36:25.250 --> 36:27.417
      Oh, evening's tricky.
          Are you, uh,

36:27.419 --> 36:29.519
   like, are you each walking
   on your own, are you alone?

36:29.521 --> 36:30.921
       What, like single?

36:31.256 --> 36:33.256
  No, not single. I don't know
     how you get to single.

36:33.258 --> 36:34.558
      Are you with friends?
          Is she alone?

36:34.560 --> 36:36.693
           -Yes. Yes.
  -Like, concerned about, like,

36:36.695 --> 36:41.264
     a man approaching her?
 Okay, so... Maybe try "Hello."

36:41.633 --> 36:44.501
    Hello is less aggressive.
    "Hello." Let her respond.

36:44.503 --> 36:46.369
      -Yeah, that's smart.
      -Give her the option.

36:46.672 --> 36:48.605
       Then once she makes
     the choice to respond,

36:48.607 --> 36:50.774
   second through a thousand,
   don't be a fucking jackass,

36:50.776 --> 36:51.808
        you know, like...

36:51.810 --> 36:54.444
       I'm going somewhere
when I'm going somewhere, right?

36:54.446 --> 36:56.479
       So, I can't, like,
    have a drink that second,

36:56.615 --> 36:58.448
       but I might want to
         in the future.

36:58.450 --> 37:02.652
      So, more like a "Hey.
         Sorry. Hello."

37:02.654 --> 37:04.487
        [chuckling] Yes.

37:04.489 --> 37:06.690
 "Would you like to have a drink
     with me at some point?"

37:07.426 --> 37:10.760
        Or, this: "Hello.
       Here's my number...

37:10.963 --> 37:12.495
   Please get in touch with me

37:12.497 --> 37:13.730
      if you'd like to have
        dinner sometime."

37:13.732 --> 37:15.432
              Ooh.

37:15.434 --> 37:17.767
    -That's a good one. Yeah.
       [giggling] I know.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.570
  -I know. Sometimes I'm right.
             -Yeah.

37:20.772 --> 37:22.939
       [Rachael chuckles]
  -You may have a point there.

37:27.646 --> 37:29.980
   I'm so jealous you can have
         just one beer.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.382
 I choose to have the one beer.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.384
  God, it really takes me back.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.286
 To what? Like, six months ago?

37:36.288 --> 37:38.321
       I can be nostalgic
       for six months ago.

37:38.323 --> 37:40.657
          -Trust me...
        [Rachael giggles]

37:40.659 --> 37:41.691
          [Jordan] Yo.

37:41.693 --> 37:44.794
       Listen, I'm payin'
   for my food the other day,

37:44.796 --> 37:46.429
 at the Wholefoods in Yorkville,

37:46.932 --> 37:48.865
    I look up the escalator,
          who do I see?

37:48.867 --> 37:52.435
        -Who? [laughing]
-Natalie-Dal-fucking-zaro, okay?

37:52.437 --> 37:53.703
           -Fuck off!
       -From grade eight.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.005
The thing that I had a ting for?

37:55.007 --> 37:56.439
    [Rachael stammers] Yeah?
            -Listen.

37:56.441 --> 37:58.675
        She's at the top
  of the escalator, I'm right,

37:58.677 --> 38:01.444
     I'm right at the bottom
  where she'd come down. Right?

38:01.613 --> 38:03.046
       [Rachael chuckles]

38:03.048 --> 38:05.015
     Rach, I felt like I was
       13-years-old again.

38:05.017 --> 38:06.549
      -Uh, instantly. Yeah.
             -Okay?

38:06.551 --> 38:07.417
          I look up...

38:07.419 --> 38:11.688
     Natalie-fuckin'-Dalzaro
        is wearing Tim's.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.290
         [Rachael] Wow.
          -Tim's, Rach!

38:13.292 --> 38:14.924
      Twenty-eight-year-old
         Natalie Dalzaro

38:14.926 --> 38:16.860
       still wears Tim's.

38:16.862 --> 38:19.429
   -It was fucking beautiful.
    -What happened with her?

38:19.431 --> 38:21.298
        I don't remember
     what happened with her.

38:21.300 --> 38:23.600
   Yeah. Erica Chung told her
     that I was a bad kisser

38:23.602 --> 38:25.869
-at some sleepover or some shit.
        [Rachael] Right!

38:25.871 --> 38:27.904
      Oh, fuck Erica Chung.

38:28.307 --> 38:30.507
   Wait. Did you say anything
     to her, at Wholefoods?

38:30.509 --> 38:32.509
         -Of course not!
     -Did you have like a...

38:32.511 --> 38:34.444
      It's Natalie Dalzaro!

38:34.446 --> 38:37.747
  Just like imagine she's gonna
 go on to marry some other dude

38:37.749 --> 38:39.316
     and raise mixed babies

38:39.318 --> 38:41.451
             with...
a man who's not a fuckin' pussy.

38:41.853 --> 38:43.320
        Yeah. Probably.

38:44.790 --> 38:47.724
   -Mine was Cristobal Tubong.
        [Jordan chuckles]

38:47.726 --> 38:49.993
      [chuckling] His hair
     was so spiky, remember?

38:49.995 --> 38:52.095
   Yo! [chuckles] You had such
      a run on those guys.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.497
  -What kind of guys? Filipino?
              -No!

38:54.499 --> 38:56.399
     -No? What kind of guys?
              -No.

38:56.401 --> 38:58.034
     Spiky-haired beat boys.

38:58.036 --> 39:00.837
   [giggles] His clothes were
always, like, six sizes too big.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.839
         -Jordan laughs]
    -I found it so endearing.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.941
  You're right. I guess it was
      the style. Anyways...

39:04.943 --> 39:06.609
         Oh, man, Chris!

39:08.080 --> 39:09.579
    I think he has a kid now.

39:10.115 --> 39:13.483
     -Yeah? How's that feel?
        [Rachael laughs]

39:13.819 --> 39:15.618
        [both laugh]

39:15.620 --> 39:17.420
    It's 'cause I stalked him
    on Facebook the other day

39:17.422 --> 39:20.056
    I saw he was with a child
 and I thought, "Is she eight?"

39:20.058 --> 39:23.026
    They had this fucking kid
  while we knew him. Anyways...

39:23.028 --> 39:24.861
        [Jordan chuckles]
     [Rachael] Good for him.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.429
       I don't want a kid.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.498
      You're a shitty host.

39:28.767 --> 39:29.899
              -Why?
    -What's going on inside?

39:29.901 --> 39:31.067
      Who are those people?

39:31.069 --> 39:32.535
         I don't know...

39:33.739 --> 39:36.373
-People. Friends. Colleagues.
        [Rachael] Mm-hmm.

39:36.375 --> 39:38.541
     Colleagues. Oh, my God!
     You said "colleagues".

39:38.543 --> 39:39.776
         [Jordan] What?
    -I'm not your friend now.

39:39.778 --> 39:41.611
     -I like my colleagues.
            -Do you?

39:41.613 --> 39:43.446
   Don't call them colleagues,
           it's gross.

39:43.915 --> 39:45.148
           Good point.

39:45.150 --> 39:46.716
 You know who's in there's too,
            is Nick?

39:46.718 --> 39:48.551
  -Not a colleague. [laughing]
         [Jordan laughs]

39:48.553 --> 39:50.420
   Probably doesn't wanna hang
      with the colleagues.

39:50.422 --> 39:53.123
 -I'm sure he's havin' a blast.
       -Shall we save him?

39:53.125 --> 39:54.824
          -Yeah, maybe.
           -Let's go.

39:56.928 --> 39:59.028
You know what? You should let me
     reupholster this couch.

39:59.598 --> 40:01.064
            [Jordan]
   Do you know how to do that?

40:01.066 --> 40:02.432
          No, I don't,
   but I feel like it could be

40:02.434 --> 40:04.401
        a very cool thing
       at a party to say.

40:04.403 --> 40:05.735
  I feel like, people are like,
"What do you do?" And I'm, like,

40:05.737 --> 40:07.470
   "Oh, I reupholster couches
        once in a while.

40:07.472 --> 40:08.805
    Yeah. No one's gonna hire
      a bad reupholsterer.

40:08.807 --> 40:10.807
     [giggling] Oh, my God!
      Who said I'd be bad?

40:10.809 --> 40:12.442
   -There are upholsterers...
    -I could be great at it!

40:12.444 --> 40:13.610
   [Rachael] I'm gonna invest
     in some business cards

40:13.612 --> 40:14.978
      and put it on there.

40:15.113 --> 40:16.179
      [muffled party music]

40:16.982 --> 40:18.481
     [loud electronic music]

40:18.483 --> 40:20.617
  [Chris] Check it out. Right?
              -Wow!

40:20.619 --> 40:21.718
     Where did you get that?

40:21.720 --> 40:22.952
   [Chris] It was downstairs.

40:22.954 --> 40:24.721
            Found it.
     You having a good time?

40:24.723 --> 40:25.989
         Honestly, man?

40:25.991 --> 40:27.690
           -I'm not...
     -Just shut up. Get up.

40:27.692 --> 40:28.858
         [Chris] Get up.
 [Crossland] Okay, here you go.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.060
         [Chris mumbles]

40:31.062 --> 40:33.062
        [Crossland sighs]
      [Chris] Are you good?

40:33.532 --> 40:36.499
    I'm great. Shal we, uh...
      Shall we ask Jordan?

40:36.501 --> 40:37.600
          [Chris] No...

40:37.602 --> 40:39.936
   Um... I just don't wanna...

40:40.439 --> 40:42.005
     As it's his new house.

40:42.007 --> 40:44.507
 It's only, like, disrespect...
    If it's gonna be a thing.

40:44.509 --> 40:45.775
           -You know?
        [Chris] Honestly,

40:45.777 --> 40:47.610
        I would want this
   for my friends in my house.

40:47.612 --> 40:48.945
    -Don't have to feel bad.
   -I know what you're saying'

40:48.947 --> 40:50.613
     [Chris] It's all good.
       [Crossland grunts]

40:50.615 --> 40:52.148
           [Chris] OK.
     [Crossland] It's cool.

40:52.551 --> 40:53.950
  [Crossland] Honestly, man...

40:54.586 --> 40:56.119
 It's just nice to do some blow

40:56.488 --> 40:58.121
        with your buddies
     at your friend's house.

40:58.123 --> 41:00.056
          -Yeah. Right?
    [Crossland] I feel safe.

41:00.058 --> 41:01.658
[Crossland] I feel fuckin' safe.

41:01.660 --> 41:03.460
       I always feel like
     I'm a fuckin' criminal

41:03.462 --> 41:05.128
         when I'm, like,
 a bathroom stall on occasion...

41:05.130 --> 41:06.563
          [Chris] Yeah.

41:06.565 --> 41:08.097
         Like a fuckin'
      Russian circus band.

41:08.467 --> 41:10.867
     [Crossland sniffs] Ooh.
   [Chris] Yeah. There you go.

41:10.869 --> 41:14.904
  Always hiding in little dark
   bathrooms and, you know...

41:15.106 --> 41:16.639
      Who wants to do that?

41:16.641 --> 41:17.841
      I just pull the flush
         and sniff, man.

41:17.843 --> 41:19.609
  I don't want anybody knowin'.

41:19.611 --> 41:21.644
  [Crossland] You cover it up?
      -Hmm-mmm. You don't?

41:21.646 --> 41:23.646
No, dude, I try to let 'em know.

41:23.648 --> 41:25.715
         [Chris] Really?
 -When you see the bathroom guy,

41:25.717 --> 41:27.217
   like, I give him a little,
         a little wink,

41:27.219 --> 41:28.518
        -and a little...
        [Chris chuckles]

41:28.520 --> 41:30.487
   That's what he's there for.

41:30.489 --> 41:31.855
  That's what he's getting paid
  for. It's to take care of us.

41:31.857 --> 41:33.223
         [Chris] Right.

41:33.225 --> 41:34.224
 [Crossland] I'm gonna give him
        his two dollars,

41:34.226 --> 41:35.959
   I'm gonna take his cologne,

41:35.961 --> 41:37.927
   everything's gonna be fine.
       He knows that shit.

41:37.929 --> 41:38.995
 [Chris] I just think that thing
      about, like civility,

41:38.997 --> 41:40.930
  the whole world would just...

41:40.932 --> 41:42.699
 I feel like descend into chaos
if everyone was just doin' blow.

41:42.701 --> 41:43.833
[Crossland] Not even everywhere.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.502
 I don't think it's everywhere.

41:45.504 --> 41:47.504
        I think of it as,
  like, bathrooms on Kings St.

41:47.506 --> 41:48.972
         [Chris] Right.
  -If that was the safe place,

41:48.974 --> 41:50.707
      -I think we're good.
   -But then everybody'd just

41:50.709 --> 41:52.008
  be, like, high all the time.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.243
        Is that the world
       you wanna live in?

41:54.846 --> 41:56.513
         -Maybe. Maybe.
             -Maybe?

41:56.515 --> 41:58.047
      But I think honest...
    like, is civility, like,

41:58.049 --> 42:00.783
  as being like a good citizen,
         the only thing

42:00.785 --> 42:02.018
    that's stoppin' everybody
    being high all the time?

42:02.020 --> 42:03.653
   [Chris] Fuck no! [sniffing]

42:03.655 --> 42:05.522
        -Think about it.
          -Maybe. Yeah.

42:05.524 --> 42:06.823
           [Crossland]
     It's fuckin' standards.

42:06.825 --> 42:08.057
      You know what it is?
      It's that nighttime,

42:08.059 --> 42:09.626
    I just prefer to be high.

42:09.628 --> 42:11.928
   I don't think that counts.

42:11.930 --> 42:13.596
   And, honestly, in general,

42:13.598 --> 42:15.131
        I probably prefer
        not to be sober.

42:15.133 --> 42:18.268
  If I had a choice, only sick
   I would choose to be sober.

42:18.270 --> 42:20.036
        [Chris] Exactly.

42:20.038 --> 42:21.738
     [Crossland sniffs] Woo!
[Chris] Oh yeah. I know exactly.

42:21.740 --> 42:23.740
           And, like,
    I know this is classic us

42:23.742 --> 42:26.543
  and always talkin' about this
  shit, but, it's not a problem

42:26.545 --> 42:27.944
 'cause we're high-functionin'.

42:27.946 --> 42:29.579
          [Chris] Yeah.
     I don't have a problem.

42:29.581 --> 42:30.780
       -Where do you work?
       -I work in a bank.

42:30.782 --> 42:32.615
           [Crossland]
    Do you know where I work?

42:32.617 --> 42:34.117
      -You work at a bank.
  [Crossland] The fuckin' bank.

42:34.119 --> 42:35.151
   [Chris] Where the money is.
       -We work the money.

42:35.153 --> 42:36.619
       We work the money.

42:36.621 --> 42:38.021
    [Chris sniffs and grunts]
        -So, this is it.

42:38.023 --> 42:39.589
         I know, I know.
 I'm gonna stop doin' blow, man.

42:39.591 --> 42:40.990
     I'm gonna stop it, too.

42:40.992 --> 42:42.692
    [Chris] I'm not gonna be
    doin' it in my thirties.

42:42.694 --> 42:44.027
      No, that's for, like,
       that's adult shit.

42:44.029 --> 42:45.295
        [Chris] I get it.
  -There's a big difference...

42:45.297 --> 42:46.596
          Oh, oh, shit!
           One second.

42:46.998 --> 42:49.132
           [no music]
        [Rachael pants]

42:50.235 --> 42:51.200
              Hey!

42:51.603 --> 42:53.269
  [chortles] Hello. What's up?

42:54.773 --> 42:57.040
       Fuck, I didn't know
        anyone in there.

42:57.042 --> 42:59.842
  [chuckles] Yeah, me neither.
    That makes the two of us.

42:59.844 --> 43:01.010
        [Rachael giggles]

43:03.782 --> 43:05.181
 Yeah, you know what? I fuckin',

43:05.183 --> 43:07.116
           I feel like
   I almost got this thing...

43:07.118 --> 43:09.986
      Yeah, what... Yeah...

43:09.988 --> 43:11.821
     [Nick grunts] You know,
     he was tryna clean it.

43:12.290 --> 43:13.756
        While it was on?

43:13.758 --> 43:15.358
      [Nick chuckles] Yeah,
        while it was on.

43:15.360 --> 43:16.793
  -He's such a wreck! [laughs]
       [Nick laughs] Yeah!

43:16.795 --> 43:19.162
       Nah, no. He's okay.
         It'll be good.

43:19.164 --> 43:20.763
     [Rachael] I hope so...

43:20.765 --> 43:22.832
     [Nick grunts] Trust me,
         he's all right.

43:23.668 --> 43:25.234
        You know they say
         it takes, like,

43:25.804 --> 43:28.071
    half the time you were in
 a relationship to get over it?

43:28.073 --> 43:30.340
           So, he has,
 like, three years of really...

43:30.976 --> 43:32.942
 workin' through it. [chuckles]

43:32.944 --> 43:34.877
        Yeah, yeah. Well,
    that would give us what?

43:34.879 --> 43:37.347
    Like, four years without
     having gotten over it?"

43:38.617 --> 43:39.949
    That's about right, yeah.

43:43.688 --> 43:44.787
       Sounds about right.

43:45.824 --> 43:47.190
    Still not drinkin', huh?

43:47.626 --> 43:49.258
   I had a beer. I had a beer.

43:49.260 --> 43:51.060
            Oh, shit,
    you being crazy tonight.

43:51.062 --> 43:53.830
          [both laugh]
              -Yes.

43:53.832 --> 43:56.666
     [Nick] Yeah, wow! Wow!
       -It's fucking wild.

43:56.668 --> 43:59.102
          Yo, you know,
Jordan's gonna be fine. [grunts]

43:59.337 --> 44:01.704
          You know how,
 how'd you handle being single?

44:02.674 --> 44:04.841
           -After you?
   -No. No, no, not after me.

44:04.843 --> 44:06.009
      After the other guy.

44:07.345 --> 44:08.945
   I didn't really handle it.

44:08.947 --> 44:10.013
             Right?

44:11.950 --> 44:13.683
  But you know that. I like...

44:13.685 --> 44:15.852
      left the city that we
   fucking lived in together,

44:15.854 --> 44:17.086
   packed it in, I gave him...

44:18.657 --> 44:20.990
   the friends and I gave him
         the dog and...

44:21.393 --> 44:23.393
     You know, the dog stuff
        always kills me.

44:23.395 --> 44:25.695
         -It's too bad.
            -Me too.

44:29.668 --> 44:30.700
     Yeah, I don't even know
        if it was, like,

44:30.702 --> 44:32.735
as bad as I thought it was then.

44:32.737 --> 44:34.203
        Like, it was bad,
       my ego was bruised

44:34.205 --> 44:35.872
 'cause he's the one who did it,

44:35.874 --> 44:37.073
    but I knew it would end,
      like most things end.

44:37.442 --> 44:38.374
            They end.

44:38.843 --> 44:40.043
  And they end badly, usually.

44:40.045 --> 44:41.344
              -Wow!
       [Rachael] I just...

44:41.346 --> 44:43.680
      -That's true, right?
           -Super sad.

44:43.682 --> 44:45.448
      -I think that's true.
             -What?

44:45.450 --> 44:47.383
 I... No, what I mean is, like,
I was just resigned to the path.

44:47.385 --> 44:50.386
    -Like, I was... You know?
  -Wha... the path? What path?

44:51.122 --> 44:53.356
         There's a path?
 I was unaware of a path, but...

44:53.892 --> 44:54.757
             Like...

44:54.759 --> 44:58.861
    Yeah. Like, house, kids,
    marriage, divorce,

44:58.863 --> 45:01.431
    the whole fuckin' thing.
      Like my folks and...

45:04.769 --> 45:06.936
      The clencher is when
  I didn't feel young with him.

45:07.439 --> 45:10.039
   You know? And that's nuts,
    'cause I'm fucking young.

45:10.041 --> 45:11.741
   [Nick] You are young, yeah.
     -I'm young. I'm young.

45:11.743 --> 45:13.409
 -You are. You are young, yeah.
    -You and Jordan are old.

45:13.411 --> 45:15.745
  -No. no, no, no, no. [laughs]
  [Rachael giggles] You're old!

45:15.747 --> 45:17.246
       -No, don't do that.
    -I'm very young. [laughs]

45:17.248 --> 45:19.215
     -I'm a spring chicken.
 -Fuck me, that shit scares me.

45:19.217 --> 45:20.883
 Yeah, you're a spring chicken,
    I'm a spring chicken too!

45:20.885 --> 45:22.485
Why can't I be a spring chicken?

45:22.487 --> 45:25.154
     No, that shit scares me
     'cause then I see signs

45:25.156 --> 45:27.757
and I look in the mirror and I'm
 like, "No, I'm, I'm for real."

45:27.759 --> 45:29.292
   [Rachael] Like what signs?
   What signs are you seeing?

45:29.294 --> 45:32.061
    Under the eyes and shit.
 And then, like, you know, like,

45:32.063 --> 45:33.963
      look, like my hair...

45:33.965 --> 45:35.465
      -What am I checking?
       [Nick] Look at it.

45:35.467 --> 45:37.066
 -It's sort of thinning, right?
          -Gray hairs.

45:37.068 --> 45:38.801
    [Nick] No, no gray hair.
     They're gray hairs too?

45:38.803 --> 45:40.103
      -No, no, no, no. No.
      [Nick] What the fuck?

45:40.105 --> 45:42.171
   -It's so, like, dark and...
        [Nick] Luscious.

45:42.173 --> 45:44.006
            -Say it?
  -That's what I was gonna say.

45:44.008 --> 45:45.775
       [Nick] Okay, good.
      See, nothing, right?

45:45.777 --> 45:47.777
             -Um...
    [Nick] What? What? What?

45:47.779 --> 45:49.112
         Why you staying
        so long up there?

45:49.114 --> 45:50.513
  -You're just thinning a bit.
         -No! Seriously?

45:50.515 --> 45:51.881
    You're totally thinning,
         but it's okay.

45:51.883 --> 45:53.416
        They have things
       that can help that.

45:53.418 --> 45:55.084
     Yeah, yeah, they have,
     like, creams and shit.

45:55.086 --> 45:57.019
  [Nick] Creams? For your head?
       -I see... [giggles]

45:57.021 --> 45:58.421
     -Fuck is that? [laughs]
   [Rachael laughs] It's fine.

45:58.423 --> 45:59.956
 -The situation is so fucked up.

45:59.958 --> 46:02.058
  -Like high school flashbacks.
          [both laugh]

46:02.060 --> 46:03.760
           [Crossland]
   I love watching you do it.

46:03.762 --> 46:05.394
        [Chris sniffing]
  -Like, I feel like you do it

46:05.396 --> 46:07.263
  And I've always thought that.

46:07.265 --> 46:08.998
   [Crossland] I feel like I'm
gettin' high watching you do it.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.299
  I know, right? You're a pro,
    like, you got this, like,

46:10.301 --> 46:11.968
    weird, like, the way you,
        like, tap your...

46:11.970 --> 46:13.336
   [Crossland] Oh, this side?
        Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:13.338 --> 46:14.837
     I have to plug my nose
    like I'm going' swimmin'.

46:14.839 --> 46:18.207
     Uh... okay. [sniffing]

46:18.209 --> 46:20.176
       [Chris] Buckle up!
[Crossland mumbles incoherently]

46:20.178 --> 46:22.512
        [Chris] Ooh, my.
      All right, you good?

46:23.148 --> 46:24.547
             -Yeah.
          [Chris] Okay.

46:24.549 --> 46:26.215
             -Uh...
  [Chris] Let's get outta here.

46:26.351 --> 46:28.317
          You wanna get
  like, outta here, outta here?

46:28.319 --> 46:30.486
        [Crossland huffs]
I don't know, dude. I feel like,

46:30.488 --> 46:32.155
 I feel like if we go downstairs

46:32.490 --> 46:35.258
     and people are movin',
     and people are dancin'

46:35.260 --> 46:37.860
        -I might want...
       [Chris] All right.

46:37.862 --> 46:39.061
        I might wanna do
        a little dancin'.

46:39.063 --> 46:40.296
  [Chris] I could figure out a
           dance too.

46:40.298 --> 46:42.064
   Okay, all right. Uh... Ooh.

46:42.066 --> 46:44.233
    -What do we do with this?
   [Chris] Save it for later.

46:44.235 --> 46:46.502
 [Crossland] We'll be back here.
    -For others. For others.

46:48.506 --> 46:50.072
  Have you been seein' anyone?

46:51.176 --> 46:53.843
        [chuckling] Wow!
      -What does that mean?

46:53.845 --> 46:55.978
         I think that's
a completely reasonable question

46:55.980 --> 46:57.380
  -to ask somebody that you...
       -No, no, I haven't.

46:57.382 --> 46:59.215
         No, I haven't.
 I haven't been seein' anybody.

46:59.217 --> 47:00.917
   I was, you know I've been,
       I've been too busy.

47:02.353 --> 47:04.587
     -You've been too busy?
     -Yeah, I've been busy.

47:05.089 --> 47:06.088
     You don't meet people?

47:06.991 --> 47:08.391
       No, I meet people.

47:08.393 --> 47:10.059
    I meet 'em when they need
    their pipes fixed, Rach.

47:10.061 --> 47:11.494
  Or their garage door openers
             fixed,

47:11.496 --> 47:14.430
    or their furnaces fixed,
  or their refrigerators fixed.

47:15.900 --> 47:17.200
           -All right.
             -Yeah.

47:17.202 --> 47:19.535
      I think it's a shame.
You'd make a good boyfriend now.

47:21.339 --> 47:22.138
           Thank you.

47:22.473 --> 47:23.573
         You're welcome.

47:25.343 --> 47:26.409
        Not then, though?

47:28.079 --> 47:29.078
              Uh...

47:29.080 --> 47:32.048
       Well, we were kids
     when we were together.

47:32.450 --> 47:34.984
  You know, you were like, you
 wouldn't even go down on me...

47:34.986 --> 47:36.485
        You were a young,

47:37.121 --> 47:38.588
       mildly selfish kid,
    and that's cool...

47:39.257 --> 47:41.624
  [Nick mumbles] Yeah... No...
    Yeah, you're right.

47:41.960 --> 47:44.894
   -It's... That sounds fair.
       [Rachael chuckles]

47:48.132 --> 47:49.465
       it's... I don't...

47:51.469 --> 47:53.603
   I don't know about all this
    gettin' to meet somebody

47:53.605 --> 47:56.439
 and, like, takin' all this time
    to get to know about 'em.

47:56.441 --> 47:58.140
   All these questions Jordan
         keeps asking me

47:58.142 --> 48:01.143
     about the girl inside,
     and how nervous he is.

48:01.145 --> 48:02.478
       I don't, you know,

48:02.480 --> 48:03.646
        I don't have time
     for all that, you know?

48:04.515 --> 48:07.316
        I just... [sighs]
    if someone comes along...

48:09.287 --> 48:12.154
         And, you know,
     if it's good, it's good

48:12.156 --> 48:15.291
    and I'm fine with that...
        That's what I do.

48:15.593 --> 48:17.260
     That's good, it's good.

48:18.296 --> 48:20.062
       [Rachael chuckles]
      Like, you are, like,

48:20.064 --> 48:21.530
           a rotation
     that you cycle through.

48:21.532 --> 48:23.065
    Like a healthy list of...

48:24.335 --> 48:27.136
    -Of babes. That's cool!
     [Nick laughs] Of babes?

48:27.138 --> 48:28.170
      I think that's great.

48:28.172 --> 48:29.605
        -I, I'm serious.
             -Yeah.

48:29.607 --> 48:31.040
  I think that's great. I do...
          -Yeah. Yeah.

48:31.042 --> 48:32.642
       It's not like that,
         but yeah, sure.

48:32.644 --> 48:35.311
      I just, I was worried
     about you for a second.

48:35.313 --> 48:36.545
     I think that that's...

48:37.115 --> 48:38.414
        good that you're
        getting out there

48:38.416 --> 48:39.415
      and you're, you know?

48:40.184 --> 48:41.284
     You were worried, huh?

48:42.987 --> 48:44.954
          Yeah, I think
       you had a hard time

48:45.356 --> 48:47.156
 when we broke up and I get that

48:47.425 --> 48:48.624
             -and...
          -So, I okay,

48:48.626 --> 48:50.226
     so I was the only one,

48:50.361 --> 48:52.094
  you know? I was the only one
      that had a hard time

48:52.096 --> 48:54.163
     from breaking up, huh?
  That, that's what it's about?

48:55.099 --> 48:56.399
           -I don't...
        -I was hurt too,

48:56.401 --> 48:57.566
           -I'm not...
    -Yeah, no, no, I get it,

48:57.568 --> 48:59.201
  but you... [stammers] I know,

48:59.203 --> 49:00.636
           I know now
 why you and Jordan are so close

49:00.638 --> 49:02.638
     because it's always...

49:02.640 --> 49:05.207
 You know, it's always gonna be,
 "Is Nick gonna be okay?" Right?

49:05.510 --> 49:07.643
   That's what it, that's what
   it's always been. Yeah, yo!

49:07.645 --> 49:09.078
        It sucks to have
        your heart broke,

49:09.080 --> 49:10.446
            but Rach,
    that was eight years ago.

49:11.149 --> 49:13.316
       I'm all right, now.
 Look at me, I'm good, you know?

49:14.485 --> 49:17.353
 Hey, you two always been actin'
like you the only two growin' up

49:17.355 --> 49:19.989
     and strugglin' with it.
   We're all strugglin', Rach.

49:19.991 --> 49:21.190
     Everybody's strugglin'.

49:21.392 --> 49:23.359
  The garage door's strugglin'.
           [chuckles]

49:26.431 --> 49:28.030
            I get it.
    That's not what I meant.

49:28.166 --> 49:29.498
  That's not what I meant. I...

49:31.636 --> 49:36.572
 I just feel like being busy is,
   is your defense mechanism.

49:37.742 --> 49:39.408
 You know? Like, I.. [chuckles]

49:39.644 --> 49:42.211
 I feel like you went to college
   to, like, ignore my calls.

49:44.182 --> 49:47.450
    Can we just fast forward
    to being friends? And...

49:48.286 --> 49:50.486
     We don't actually talk
     about anything, like...

49:50.688 --> 49:52.989
       Like, I totally get
     why you said to Jordan

49:52.991 --> 49:54.290
  that it'd been a couple years
         since we spoke,

49:54.292 --> 49:56.759
     like, 'cause that's not
         actually true,

49:57.228 --> 49:59.662
         but, but it's,
       it's been that long

49:59.664 --> 50:02.164
         since we've had
   a fuckin real conversation

50:02.166 --> 50:06.435
since, you know, since it wasn't
      bullshit small talk.

50:07.238 --> 50:09.071
        And I am curious
     about who you are now.

50:10.341 --> 50:13.242
    I'm the same dude, Rach,
  I'm just a little bit older.

50:13.478 --> 50:15.077
        And smarter too.

50:16.647 --> 50:21.717
   Don't you wonder about me?

50:21.719 --> 50:23.052
    Yeah, I wonder about you.

50:24.288 --> 50:25.388
        [whispers] Good.

50:25.390 --> 50:28.791
        Wonder like, how?
    Like, wonder how, though?

50:28.793 --> 50:31.794
     No, I, I... [chuckles]
        I don't know how,

50:31.796 --> 50:33.429
    I don't know what I mean,
            I just...

50:34.465 --> 50:36.298
         I think we have
  these bullshit conversations

50:36.300 --> 50:37.466
          all the time.

50:37.468 --> 50:39.168
Like, "How's your family doin'?"

50:39.370 --> 50:41.303
       'Cause that's safe
 and it's a point of reference,

50:41.305 --> 50:42.805
         but it's, like,
      it's never in person,

50:43.141 --> 50:45.241
    it's always on the phone,
           and, and...

50:46.077 --> 50:47.576
        I just feel like
        you are the same

50:47.578 --> 50:49.578
      -but you have this...
        [whispers] Gift.

50:49.580 --> 50:53.115
  ...understanding of self now
 that's different and it's nice.

50:55.319 --> 50:56.285
       I think it's nice.

50:56.287 --> 50:58.387
    Oh, balding? The balding?

50:58.389 --> 51:00.356
 It gives you, like, you know...

51:00.358 --> 51:03.259
           [chuckling]
    ...some life experience.

51:03.261 --> 51:05.227
    -Where do you come from?
        [Rachael giggles]

51:13.104 --> 51:15.137
         -Okay. [grunts]
             -What?

51:15.139 --> 51:17.239
   -What? What are you doin'?
             -Argh!

51:17.241 --> 51:19.108
[Rachael] Why would you do that?
              -No!

51:19.644 --> 51:21.310
   [Rachael] I don't get that.
 -I said I wasn't gonna do that!

51:21.312 --> 51:23.112
   [Rachael] I don't get that.
         Said it to who?

51:23.114 --> 51:24.413
             Myself.

51:24.415 --> 51:25.748
      -What are you doing?
       [Nick] 'Cause I...

51:25.750 --> 51:27.516
'Cause we're in Jordan's garage!

51:27.518 --> 51:30.653
So, what? It was never a problem
  in Jordan's parent's garage.

51:32.123 --> 51:34.857
 Yeah, but it's Jordan's garage.
   This is stupid. It's crazy.

51:34.859 --> 51:36.492
 [Rachael] It's fucking stupid.

51:37.295 --> 51:38.427
            Oh, God!

51:39.497 --> 51:41.263
             [sighs]

51:41.666 --> 51:44.733
    I always thought you'd be
  the first one to buy a house.

51:45.503 --> 51:47.670
      [sighs] Yeah, me too.

51:49.707 --> 51:51.340
         Yo, you know...

51:51.342 --> 51:53.742
  that whole university thing,
             for me,

51:54.312 --> 51:55.678
         that wasn't me,
   that was Jordan, you know?

51:55.680 --> 51:57.480
       That was his life.

51:57.482 --> 51:58.714
      And you, you did what
    you wanted to do, right?

51:59.250 --> 52:00.683
    I was always proud of you
         for doin' that.

52:00.685 --> 52:02.685
       You always did what
  you wanted to do. [chuckles]

52:02.687 --> 52:03.853
       [Rachael chuckles]

52:03.855 --> 52:07.556
  I liked that. And I was good
    at the gas fitting thing.

52:08.126 --> 52:09.191
            You know?

52:11.762 --> 52:12.995
          That's great.

52:12.996 --> 52:14.229
      -It's great. [laughs]
          [Nick laughs]

52:14.232 --> 52:16.132
           I was good
     with the job, you know?

52:16.134 --> 52:19.702
    That pays. That pays, yo.
  Eventually it pays. [sniffs]

52:19.704 --> 52:21.904
       I was apprenticing,
    and I was doin' my thing.

52:21.906 --> 52:24.540
  It just made sense, you know,
    that I was at the house.

52:24.709 --> 52:26.142
     The wife with the kids.

52:26.144 --> 52:27.643
 The wife, the house, the kids,

52:27.645 --> 52:29.378
     whatever way you wanted
      to put it, you know?

52:29.380 --> 52:31.480
          Like, I was,
  I was ready for it. You know?

52:32.783 --> 52:34.183
       That's very sweet.

52:34.519 --> 52:35.584
        [whispers] Yeah.

52:36.587 --> 52:37.553
             It is.

52:38.222 --> 52:39.588
 Yeah, you know, but I guess...

52:41.259 --> 52:42.892
         I guess I never
 went lookin' for it, you know?

52:44.495 --> 52:46.262
           I guess...

52:46.264 --> 52:47.663
     or maybe, I don't know,
 maybe she didn't come find me.

52:48.766 --> 52:49.899
        Whoever "she" is.

52:51.736 --> 52:53.502
          You know me.

52:53.504 --> 52:54.770
      I was supposed to be
    on my second kid by now,

52:54.772 --> 52:56.172
           [chuckles]
   ...that's what we all said.

52:57.575 --> 52:58.440
         I thought that.

52:59.577 --> 53:00.943
 I thought that you would be...

53:03.581 --> 53:04.480
         But it's okay.

53:04.849 --> 53:06.549
    It can still happen now.

53:09.387 --> 53:10.686
          [Nick] Yeah.
      -There's still time.

53:10.688 --> 53:11.921
      There is still time.

53:12.423 --> 53:14.490
      -You're not that old.
          -I'm not old.

  the fuck have you been, man?

55:27.525 --> 55:28.590
              -Hey!
 -What's up, man? How you doin'?

55:28.592 --> 55:29.792
               Yo.

55:29.794 --> 55:31.360
   This is a dope party, dude.

55:31.362 --> 55:32.494
            -Thanks.
    -Havin' a fuckin' blast.

55:32.496 --> 55:33.529
    -Havin' a fuckin' blast.
          -Thanks, man.

55:33.531 --> 55:34.697
     This is, you own this?

55:34.699 --> 55:36.031
        -Yeah! My place.
          -This is you.

55:36.033 --> 55:37.599
       -You own the house.
         [Jordan] Yeah.

55:37.601 --> 55:39.702
     Do you, uh... You catch
    a little bit of the show?

55:39.704 --> 55:41.537
        You'll... some...

55:41.539 --> 55:43.072
 [Jordan] Yeah, no, I saw that,
man. That was, that was amazin'.

55:43.074 --> 55:44.773
    It was nothin', you know?
        I was just, like,

55:44.775 --> 55:46.775
   I was just foolin' around.
  I just wanted you to see it.

55:46.777 --> 55:47.976
    -And I thought that if...
          [Jordan] Oh.

55:47.978 --> 55:49.545
   If you thought it was cool

55:49.547 --> 55:51.113
           and, like,
   'cause else it's all good.

55:51.115 --> 55:52.781
     -Yeah. Thanks for that.
     -You know what I mean?

55:52.783 --> 55:54.616
   It's cool to hang with you
      outside of work, man.

55:54.618 --> 55:56.018
 -Like... It's good to see you.
         -Yeah, this is,

55:56.020 --> 55:57.419
      -This is cool, right?
     -It's cool, it's cool.

55:57.421 --> 55:59.521
       Listen, do you have
          a salad bowl?

55:59.523 --> 56:00.823
              Yeah.

56:00.825 --> 56:02.391
         Are you talkin'
      about that white one?

56:03.961 --> 56:05.661
          That's, yeah,
      that's my salad bowl.

56:05.963 --> 56:07.062
          Technically,
     it's not a salad bowl,

56:07.064 --> 56:08.664
    it's like a mixing bowl.

56:08.666 --> 56:10.599
      Uh, understand, like,
       a real salad bowl,

56:10.601 --> 56:11.967
 -it's got like a wide mouth...
     -What's the difference?

56:11.969 --> 56:13.836
        It lets the air,
   it lets the leaves breathe.

56:13.838 --> 56:15.471
      I was thinkin' maybe
  if you needed one, I could...

56:15.473 --> 56:17.072
     [Chris] Guys! Hey, man.
    [Crossland] Yo! Yo, Look!

56:17.074 --> 56:18.574
            -Jordan!
           -Hey, man!

56:18.576 --> 56:20.609
      Hey! Uh, congrats...
          On the house!

56:20.745 --> 56:22.478
 He thought that his mixing bowl

56:22.480 --> 56:24.413
 was a fuckin' salad bowl, too.
            [laughs]

56:24.415 --> 56:25.914
-That's crazy, right? I did too.
   -Way different thing, man.

56:25.916 --> 56:27.750
[Chris] Yeah, they're completely
     different things, man.

56:27.752 --> 56:29.518
 -It's a whole different thing.
          -I was, like,

56:29.520 --> 56:31.053
 here's a salad bowl, he's like,
     "That's a mixing bowl."

56:31.055 --> 56:32.721
    One of them is just like,
   if you wanna be an adult...

56:32.723 --> 56:34.556
       [Chris] You should,
   you should come get you one

56:34.558 --> 56:35.524
       'cause it's, it's,
  it's like a wood-thing, man.

56:35.526 --> 56:36.892
   It's a salad bowl. Like...

56:36.894 --> 56:38.761
       Yeah, but it's like
       a wood salad bowl.

56:38.763 --> 56:39.995
-Yeah, totally different things.
      [Chris] Mixing bowls,

56:39.997 --> 56:41.397
          salad bowls,
    totally different things.

56:41.399 --> 56:42.564
 Totally different things, man.

56:42.566 --> 56:43.766
          -It's a bowl.
     -It's, it's not a bowl.

56:43.768 --> 56:45.067
 [all three] It's a salad bowl.

56:45.069 --> 56:46.101
       [Chris] I'm coming
        'round to it too.

56:46.103 --> 56:47.102
      I know it's 'cause...

56:47.104 --> 56:48.604
     I don't want a salad...

56:48.606 --> 56:49.905
          I don't need
      a fucking salad bowl!

56:49.907 --> 56:50.939
          [Chris] Okay.
   -No one needs a salad bowl.

56:50.941 --> 56:52.675
    I think, I think you hit
    the salad bowl thing

56:52.676 --> 56:54.410
       -a little too hard.
   -I think I was pushin' it.

56:54.412 --> 56:56.645
   [door bangs] [glass clinks]

57:23.808 --> 57:24.706
        [glass smashing]

57:29.146 --> 57:35.050
   [house party ambient music]

57:39.790 --> 57:42.024
  [door closes] [muffled music]

57:42.893 --> 57:44.159
              Hey!

57:45.162 --> 57:46.695
            Hey. Hi.

57:50.668 --> 57:51.533
          You alright?

57:52.570 --> 57:53.469
          You did this?

57:55.539 --> 57:56.505
       It's mine to clean.

58:01.145 --> 58:01.944
       I'm okay. I just...

58:01.945 --> 58:02.744
           Just needed
      to get out the party.

58:03.113 --> 58:05.547
   I don't think I've seen you
      since the beginning.

58:06.217 --> 58:08.617
       Yeah... Um, sorry.

58:09.720 --> 58:12.087
        [sighs] Uh, well,
   I don't think there's, um,

58:12.556 --> 58:13.755
      too many people left.

58:17.695 --> 58:20.028
        Uh, it's... just
some old friends, you know? I...

58:20.831 --> 58:22.664
          Have I really
    been out here that long?

58:23.000 --> 58:24.199
       Hmm? I don't know.

58:29.740 --> 58:30.706
        You want a drink?

58:31.775 --> 58:32.875
          No, I'm good.

58:39.950 --> 58:41.750
            So, um...

58:42.987 --> 58:43.886
          I'm gonna go.

58:46.023 --> 58:46.855
           But, um...

58:47.725 --> 58:49.024
     Congrats on your house.

58:50.528 --> 58:51.593
        [Jordan] Thanks.

58:53.197 --> 58:54.229
              Bye.

59:02.773 --> 59:04.673
      -I fixed your faucet.
         [Jordan] What?

59:05.075 --> 59:05.941
          [Bree] Yeah.

59:08.078 --> 59:09.811
              Okay.

59:09.813 --> 59:10.846
     You invited me to your
       house-warming party

59:10.848 --> 59:11.914
         after one date.

59:11.916 --> 59:14.883
       And I thought that
  was really cool, I liked it.

59:16.020 --> 59:18.587
    This guy with a house
       is in to me and...

59:19.657 --> 59:21.023
    He invites me over,
         so I'm gonna...

59:21.258 --> 59:23.792
      Put on something nice
and pass through and see what...

59:24.128 --> 59:25.861
         But he's about
      and you've literally

59:25.863 --> 59:27.262
       been in your garage
     since I've gotten here.

59:28.966 --> 59:29.998
             Sorry.

59:34.104 --> 59:36.004
      Are you even into me?

59:38.943 --> 59:39.975
           I guess...

59:40.578 --> 59:41.610
        [whispers] Okay.

59:42.212 --> 59:43.278
     That's very flattering.

59:44.348 --> 59:46.181
 We been out a couple of times,

59:46.183 --> 59:47.816
            not like
   we really know each other.

59:47.818 --> 59:49.651
  No, we don't know each other
             at all.

59:50.988 --> 59:53.989
        So, I don't know.
        Maybe one day...

59:56.126 --> 59:57.192
     [scoffs] One day, what?

59:59.096 --> 01:00:00.762
    Are you attracted to me?

01:00:01.899 --> 01:00:04.199
        [Jordan] Sure.
   -Sure. Okay. That's great.

01:00:06.303 --> 01:00:09.137
     I don't know if I have
   the energy for games, Bree.

01:00:09.139 --> 01:00:11.640
          Oh, I'm sorry
    if I'm not just grunting.

01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:14.076
           Yes! You're
   very remarkably attractive.

01:00:14.078 --> 01:00:15.110
           -Thank you.
             -Okay?

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:16.378
         You're welcome.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.046
    -You're very good lookin'
        [Jordan] Thanks.

01:00:20.317 --> 01:00:23.085
  And do you want to marry me?

01:00:23.354 --> 01:00:25.687
   Honestly, I don't know what
   I'm lookin' for right now.

01:00:25.689 --> 01:00:27.856
 No. you don't want to marry me.

01:00:27.858 --> 01:00:29.758
    I can tell you that much,
           right now.

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:32.194
  Like, you don't. And I don't.

01:00:32.997 --> 01:00:34.262
There. It's out the window.

01:00:34.264 --> 01:00:35.330
     I don't even want to be
    your girlfriend. Jordan.

01:00:35.332 --> 01:00:36.732
              Okay.

01:00:36.734 --> 01:00:38.300
              Okay,
  so can you stop being weird?

01:00:39.003 --> 01:00:40.769
    Like, you're into me.

01:00:40.771 --> 01:00:43.405
     And I'm kinda into you
   and we can go out on dates.

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:46.008
        And we can fuck.

01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:48.844
    And it wouldn't be weird.
           Not for me.

01:00:49.279 --> 01:00:51.413
    That sounds great.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:53.048
       Yeah, it would be.

01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:57.052
       Is that your point?

01:00:57.054 --> 01:00:58.353
      That I'm missin' out
  on somethin'? 'Cause I know.

01:00:59.256 --> 01:01:00.322
            So, then?

01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:03.058
  I just don't know if I could.

01:01:04.895 --> 01:01:06.895
         [Jordan sighs]
    [Bree] Like, physically?

01:01:06.897 --> 01:01:09.898
 No! That's fine. I just mean...

01:01:10.968 --> 01:01:13.001
   I don't know what it would
     bring out in me and...

01:01:13.437 --> 01:01:15.070
          You shouldn't
     have to deal with that.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.073
        I'm not even sure
  I'm ready to deal with that.

01:01:22.312 --> 01:01:24.413
    What? What am I missing?

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:27.049
         I'm sorry, I...

01:01:28.786 --> 01:01:30.719
    I've just got out of a...

01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:34.022
  [sighs] ...long relationship.
 I should have told you sooner.

01:01:34.892 --> 01:01:36.091
       [Bree] That's fine.

01:01:36.393 --> 01:01:37.392
          How recently?

01:01:39.396 --> 01:01:41.229
       Like, eight months.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:44.066
      That's almost a year.

01:01:46.203 --> 01:01:49.805
    It's not a year, it's...
      two-thirds of a year.

01:01:49.807 --> 01:01:50.806
          Technically.

01:01:53.143 --> 01:01:54.409
      And you haven't slept
        with anyone else.

01:01:54.411 --> 01:01:56.244
         No, I haven't.

01:01:56.914 --> 01:01:58.914
    -And you're embarrassed.
          [Jordan] Yes!

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:02.117
      -I fucking guess so.
      -Hey! Look, I'm so...

01:02:02.786 --> 01:02:05.721
  Hey. I'm sorry. I was just...
   that was me being curious.

01:02:05.723 --> 01:02:06.755
           I'm sorry.

01:02:07.357 --> 01:02:08.490
    Why are you embarrassed?

01:02:10.427 --> 01:02:13.495
   I... I don't know. I guess,
'cause I could've and I haven't.

01:02:14.098 --> 01:02:16.131
 I could be fuckin' all the time
          and I don't.

01:02:16.133 --> 01:02:19.067
       -It's not the same.
  -Yes, it's exactly the same.

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:22.404
   It brings up weird feelings
           for people.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:24.139
             Like...

01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:26.775
            You know,
   maybe I wanna do this again

01:02:26.777 --> 01:02:28.009
 with the same person, tomorrow.

01:02:28.512 --> 01:02:29.778
             But...

01:02:31.181 --> 01:02:34.082
      You're not gonna know
        unless you do it,

01:02:34.785 --> 01:02:36.918
  you consider it or you start
    to process it, right?

01:02:41.892 --> 01:02:44.059
    You think you're getting
   back together with your ex?

01:02:44.194 --> 01:02:45.327
               No.

01:02:46.964 --> 01:02:48.497
         Does she think
    that you think you will?

01:02:50.134 --> 01:02:51.099
               No.

01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:54.469
   So, then, you're gonna have
      to start the process.

01:03:01.879 --> 01:03:04.880
   I know I'm giving you tons
 of great advice here. [giggles]

01:03:05.916 --> 01:03:11.153
     and I don't mean to...
 undercut all of our work and...

01:03:12.256 --> 01:03:14.389
     I definitely don't mean
     to rub this in, but...

01:03:15.092 --> 01:03:16.191
        I'm a good catch.

01:03:16.894 --> 01:03:18.860
        And you can still
        not fuck this up.

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:33.542
          [Bree smirks]

01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:39.365
              So...

01:03:39.366 --> 01:03:40.182
   Let's call it there for now

01:03:40.184 --> 01:03:41.583
      and maybe back-pocket
       the rest for later.

01:03:41.585 --> 01:03:45.020
    -That's completely fair.
         [Bree giggles]

01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:47.255
      So, what is the deal
        with this house?

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:49.424
        What do you mean?

01:03:49.426 --> 01:03:52.427
    I mean, like, why is this
    your last day in a house

01:03:52.429 --> 01:03:54.596
      outside of downtown,
   with a backyard and garage?

01:03:55.098 --> 01:03:58.200
    -It's a good investment.
         [Bree giggles]

01:03:58.202 --> 01:03:59.835
 Sorry, you're resigned to that?

01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:01.203
         Just 'cause I'm
        struggling a bit.

01:04:03.473 --> 01:04:05.240
  It's what I was ready to do.

01:04:06.276 --> 01:04:08.243
Right. Yeah, no. Looks like you.

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:09.277
         [Jordan smirks]

01:04:09.279 --> 01:04:13.248
   I swear, I was killin' this
up until a couple of nights ago.

01:04:13.884 --> 01:04:17.018
    Sweep this, tighten that,
    oh, the fuse blew?

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:19.254
  Then I'll go to the fuse box
        and change it.

01:04:19.957 --> 01:04:21.923
[chuckles] I had this shit down!

01:04:23.427 --> 01:04:24.459
              Okay.

01:04:26.597 --> 01:04:28.196
         [Jordan smirks]

01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:31.566
       Then I came in here
   to straighten up some shit.

01:04:32.135 --> 01:04:34.536
And I said, "Let me try and open
        the garage door."

01:04:35.405 --> 01:04:36.171
          It went fine.

01:04:36.173 --> 01:04:38.907
          Then I heard
    this little click-clack.

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:43.378
        So I got up there
      to try and fix it...

01:04:45.482 --> 01:04:46.431
        What, it's stuck?

01:04:46.432 --> 01:04:47.381
     Yeah, like super-stuck.

01:04:48.552 --> 01:04:49.951
    And I tried to ignore it

01:04:49.953 --> 01:04:51.519
        for a couple days
         but then, like,

01:04:51.521 --> 01:04:53.321
  within 15 minutes of everyone
   getting here, I was like...

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:56.024
       Anybody that's here

01:04:56.026 --> 01:04:57.425
  is gonna know that this guy's
     garage door can't open.

01:04:59.196 --> 01:05:02.397
        [Bree] Huh? What?
What are you even talkin' about?

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:03.298
       Do you have a car?

01:05:03.901 --> 01:05:05.233
          No... But...

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:06.601
           [Bree] So,
    then, who the fuck cares

01:05:06.603 --> 01:05:07.469
       if your garage door
          doesn't open?

01:05:07.471 --> 01:05:09.104
    Garage doors should open!

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:12.407
    [Bree] But yours doesn't.
            -Exactly!

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:15.277
       [Bree] Okay. Um...

01:05:17.648 --> 01:05:19.247
  Is this you just being nuts?

01:05:20.384 --> 01:05:22.017
      Yeah. Um, obviously.

01:05:24.288 --> 01:05:25.353
       Can I just be nuts?

01:05:25.355 --> 01:05:28.156
        I don't know, um,
    yeah, of course, you can.

01:05:28.158 --> 01:05:29.024
          I, I guess...

01:05:30.928 --> 01:05:35.297
 Wait. You gotta understand that
  it doesn't... really matter.

01:05:35.299 --> 01:05:38.033
  Unless you can't get over it.
     But, even still, like,

01:05:38.302 --> 01:05:39.968
    there's a lot worse shit

01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:41.703
          goin' on than
  your garage door not opening.

01:05:41.705 --> 01:05:42.971
           Like what?

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:46.441
       [Bree] Everything.
    Are you fucking serious?

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:48.043
        I wanna like you

01:05:48.045 --> 01:05:49.978
      but you're literally
     doin' everything wrong.

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.313
 [Jordan mumbles] I was joking.

01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:54.082
         [sighs] I know!
       But, Jesus, like...

01:05:54.618 --> 01:05:56.217
     You know, the last time
    I was in a relationship,

01:05:56.219 --> 01:05:58.286
    the guy broke up with me
    and didn't even say why.

01:05:58.488 --> 01:06:00.021
         That was awful.

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:03.325
          I was single

01:06:03.327 --> 01:06:05.193
        after putting in
       all this life-work

01:06:05.195 --> 01:06:07.262
         with a guy that
     I thought was gonna be

01:06:07.264 --> 01:06:08.697
   the father of my children.

01:06:11.201 --> 01:06:12.133
        And I loved him.

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:15.370
 And I probably still love him.

01:06:21.178 --> 01:06:22.510
  And now he's getting married.

01:06:26.616 --> 01:06:28.450
And I know that at some point...

01:06:29.619 --> 01:06:33.154
 I'm not gonna love him because
  I'm gonna love somebody else,

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:36.324
       and I'm not sayin'
  it's gonna be you, trust me.

01:06:36.593 --> 01:06:38.093
         I am not sayin'
       it's gonna be you.

01:06:40.697 --> 01:06:42.697
 But I'm not done with romance.

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:46.001
        And I didn't sit
     in a pile of my shit...

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:50.271
Instead of being with the people
 that could make me feel better.

01:07:01.284 --> 01:07:03.551
      Are you still reading
     this intro to Biology?

01:07:03.553 --> 01:07:04.753
  [Jordan] Never even started.

01:07:04.755 --> 01:07:06.054
         [banging sound]

01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:09.591
  Yours? I mean, no judgement.

01:07:09.593 --> 01:07:10.458
         [Jordan] Hers.

01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:15.697
     So throw this shit out.
      Take it to goodwill.

01:07:18.568 --> 01:07:19.467
       I don't have a car.

01:07:20.337 --> 01:07:23.371
       [sighs and laughs]

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:25.774
  Right. You don't have a car,
      but you have a house.

01:07:25.776 --> 01:07:27.742
          [Bree scoffs]
        -I have a house.

01:07:29.346 --> 01:07:31.312
  God, you're so fucking cute.

01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:35.717
       Can we go outside?

01:07:36.286 --> 01:07:37.118
              Yeah.

01:07:47.664 --> 01:07:49.264
              -Hey!
          -Whoa! Easy!

01:07:49.266 --> 01:07:50.532
     Oh, there you are, yo.

01:07:50.534 --> 01:07:51.800
    Yo, there's like people,
          like, inside

01:07:51.802 --> 01:07:53.435
   that are lookin' for you...

01:07:53.437 --> 01:07:54.836
     [Jordan chuckles] Okay.
       -And I said, like,

01:07:54.838 --> 01:07:56.438
    I'd come back and get you
        to let you know.

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.239
           [chuckling]
    What are you guys sayin'?

01:07:58.508 --> 01:08:01.076
        -I owe Nick head.
        -Nice. [chuckles]

01:08:01.812 --> 01:08:03.611
 So, did we interrupt something?

01:08:03.613 --> 01:08:05.547
  No, no. it's fine. I'm just,

01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:08.249
  I am coaching Jordan through
 his minor quarter-life crisis.

01:08:09.219 --> 01:08:10.518
   This shit fucks people up.

01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:13.254
    Nick couldn't go on dates
      for years after you.

01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:15.490
       [laughs] I knew it.
           -Fuck, man.

01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:17.692
        Do you guys care
      if this guy get laid?

01:08:17.694 --> 01:08:19.194
              -No.
              -No.

01:08:19.196 --> 01:08:21.863
 No. And then him owning a house
  doesn't matter either, right?

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:24.299
   No! Uh, probably even less.

01:08:24.301 --> 01:08:25.834
      Like, I fucking hate
      that you own a house.

01:08:25.836 --> 01:08:27.502
    Fair enough. That's fair.

01:08:27.871 --> 01:08:29.636
         And obviously,
      you guys love Jordan.

01:08:29.639 --> 01:08:30.604
             -Yeah!
             -Yeah.

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:32.807
     Even if his garage door
          doesn't open?

01:08:33.176 --> 01:08:34.576
     [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah.
             -Yeah.

01:08:34.578 --> 01:08:35.542
              Okay.

01:08:35.545 --> 01:08:38.345
       [Rachael chuckles]
         [buzzing sound]

01:08:38.348 --> 01:08:39.613
    Did he tell you that, uh,

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:41.149
      he tried to fix this
        while it was on?

01:08:41.651 --> 01:08:42.684
       You tried doing it
        while it was on?

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:44.652
      Yes! While it was on.

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:46.720
     You can't just lift it?

01:08:47.657 --> 01:08:49.491
   No, you can't just lift it.

01:08:50.861 --> 01:08:52.292
   So then, what does that do?

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.295
     [Jordan and Nick] What?
             -That.

01:08:54.764 --> 01:08:57.332
Are you guys fucking kidding me?

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:03.304
        [clanking noise]

01:09:04.407 --> 01:09:05.673
         [buzzing sound]

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:11.880
      [Jordan laughs] Woo!

01:09:12.415 --> 01:09:13.548
              Woo!

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:17.919
           -Oh, shit.
    [Nick] Wow, fucking hell.

01:09:18.755 --> 01:09:20.421
     Are we over this whole
          garage thing?

01:09:21.224 --> 01:09:22.390
             -Yeah.
             -Okay.

01:09:22.392 --> 01:09:24.609
'Cause I would love to go inside
        and get a drink.

01:09:24.609 --> 01:09:26.827
 I mean, I know your friends are
gonna go blow each other, but...

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:27.795
    Can you make me a drink?

01:09:28.532 --> 01:09:29.898
        -Yeah, we can go.
             -Okay.

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:36.237
       [Jordan] Oh, Bree?
          [Bree] Yeah?

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:39.174
    Just give me one minute.
 I still gotta deal with the...

01:09:39.176 --> 01:09:40.375
     Oh, yeah. That's fine.

01:09:40.844 --> 01:09:42.277
          -I'm comin'.
             -Okay.
