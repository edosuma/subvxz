00:14.005 --> 00:15.211
Lucille.

00:15.212 --> 00:16.648
Hey!

00:16.736 --> 00:18.066
Hey, it's looking good.

00:18.100 --> 00:20.068
- Tell me you got good news.
- I do.

00:20.102 --> 00:22.333
Stable Shelters' bridge loan
has just been approved.

00:22.367 --> 00:24.002
Harvey pulled
some strings at the bank.

00:24.036 --> 00:26.108
Ah, good to see you,
Harvey.

00:26.142 --> 00:27.914
I figured you was allergic
to manual labor.

00:27.948 --> 00:30.719
Oh, I'll get my hands dirty
if I have to, Lucille.

00:30.753 --> 00:33.027
But I believe
charity begins at home.

00:33.061 --> 00:34.928
Yeah, and based on
that Rolex you wear,

00:34.963 --> 00:37.035
I'd say that your favorite cause
is doing pretty good.

00:37.069 --> 00:39.271
We're gonna need
your signature here.

00:39.305 --> 00:41.807
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
15% interest?

00:41.842 --> 00:44.176
They're worried about
Stable Shelter's solvency.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.343
They're worried?

00:45.378 --> 00:47.045
They should try being
executive director.

00:47.079 --> 00:48.212
If you don't recover the money

00:48.247 --> 00:50.380
that Anthony Mazlo
embezzled from us,

00:50.415 --> 00:52.216
every one of these
projects goes dark.

00:52.250 --> 00:53.951
Unless you got
a spare room or two

00:53.985 --> 00:55.919
for a couple thousand families
in your condo.

00:55.953 --> 00:57.754
I'm not really
a roommate kind of guy.

00:57.788 --> 00:58.854
Oh.

00:58.889 --> 01:00.489
Harvey's deposing
Elliot Perkins,

01:00.524 --> 01:02.424
Mazlo's number two,
this afternoon.

01:02.458 --> 01:04.058
Perkins had to have
knowledge of this,

01:04.093 --> 01:05.492
and he's going
to give up his boss.

01:05.528 --> 01:07.197
That's a promise.
Excuse me.

01:15.411 --> 01:18.781
Check it out.
Mazlo spent $500 a night

01:18.815 --> 01:21.620
on doggie daycare
on his trip to Greece.

01:21.654 --> 01:23.989
Greece.

01:24.024 --> 01:24.990
What?

01:25.025 --> 01:28.062
- Oh, nothing.
- Tell me.

01:28.097 --> 01:31.968
My first time
was in Greece.

01:32.002 --> 01:33.837
My God, you're picturing that
right now, aren't you?

01:33.871 --> 01:36.141
I have no choice.
I'm a visual person.

01:40.814 --> 01:42.349
You two
are really adorable.

01:42.383 --> 01:44.518
We're 48 hours from trial,
and you're gossiping

01:44.552 --> 01:46.954
like two 12-year-olds
at sleepaway camp.

01:51.961 --> 01:53.729
Listen up.

01:53.764 --> 01:56.433
Lucille Jackson's not just the
head of Stable Shelters, okay?

01:56.467 --> 01:58.503
She also sits
on the Board of Directors

01:58.537 --> 02:00.038
of several of
our largest clients.

02:00.072 --> 02:02.073
So if we lose this case,

02:02.107 --> 02:04.476
I doubt that her generosity's
going to extend to us.

02:04.511 --> 02:06.044
I would--
In my office.

02:06.079 --> 02:07.746
Bring the clarity-drilling IPO.

02:07.780 --> 02:11.149
Jerome Jensen's here.
Come on.

02:11.183 --> 02:13.151
Lucille's case
is all hands on deck, Harvey.

02:13.185 --> 02:15.319
You can't just--
I can, and I am.

02:15.354 --> 02:16.921
I thought we're
working on this together.

02:16.955 --> 02:18.155
Yeah, we are, Louis.

02:18.190 --> 02:20.458
Same way a golfer
and his caddy work together.

02:20.492 --> 02:22.926
Be that as it may,

02:22.961 --> 02:25.429
we are deposing Elliot Perkins
in 15 minutes, so--

02:25.463 --> 02:26.431
Perkins can wait.

02:26.465 --> 02:27.832
Just make sure that my 9 iron

02:27.867 --> 02:29.367
is nice and shiny
when I get there.

02:29.402 --> 02:31.570
Okay?
Come on, Mike.

02:35.776 --> 02:37.077
Harvey.

02:37.112 --> 02:39.213
Jerome Jensen,
meet Mike Ross.

02:39.247 --> 02:40.381
He's got the latest
on the IPO.

02:40.415 --> 02:41.715
- Hello, Mike.
- Mr. Jensen.

02:41.750 --> 02:44.185
I'm not here to talk
about my business, Harvey.

02:44.219 --> 02:47.388
Looks like my daughter might be
getting into some trouble.

02:47.422 --> 02:49.490
Mildred Wisnewski.

02:49.525 --> 02:51.692
What's Lola doing
with a fake I.D.?

02:51.727 --> 02:53.895
Well, that's what I hope
you can find out.

02:53.929 --> 02:55.363
It slipped out of her purse

02:55.397 --> 02:57.531
when she was ordering a drink
at a friend's bar mitzvah.

02:57.566 --> 03:01.268
Any idea what it's about?

03:01.303 --> 03:05.639
My relationship with Lola's
been rocky for a few years.

03:05.673 --> 03:08.876
If I asked her,
she'd just lie.

03:08.911 --> 03:10.178
Truth is,
I don't need to know.

03:10.213 --> 03:13.248
I just need you
to take care of it.

03:13.283 --> 03:16.152
Thank you.

03:16.186 --> 03:17.820
What the hell
is Harvey doing?

03:17.855 --> 03:19.622
He's supposed to be
deposing Elliot Perkins.

03:19.657 --> 03:20.723
He's with a client.

03:20.758 --> 03:22.726
I don't care.
We have a deposition.

03:22.760 --> 03:27.497
Don't even try it, Louis.

03:27.531 --> 03:28.831
I'm sorry.

03:28.866 --> 03:30.600
Let's--let's just start over.
Okay?

03:30.635 --> 03:32.936
Hi, Donna.
Hi.

03:32.970 --> 03:35.205
You know I like you,
right?

03:35.239 --> 03:36.807
But in the firm's food chain,

03:36.841 --> 03:39.976
I am a humpback whale,
and you are phytoplankton.

03:43.848 --> 03:46.316
June 3, 1997.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.724
That date
means nothing to me.

03:53.759 --> 03:56.661
Doesn't it?

03:56.695 --> 03:57.695
Who told you?

03:57.730 --> 03:59.497
Is the important thing
how I know

03:59.532 --> 04:01.432
or <i>that</i> I know?

04:01.467 --> 04:02.767
Does Harvey know?

04:02.801 --> 04:04.102
He can.

04:04.136 --> 04:05.403
I'm going to pay you.

04:05.438 --> 04:07.339
I just don't have
cash on me right now.

04:07.373 --> 04:09.108
So I'm gonna just tell Norma

04:09.142 --> 04:10.476
to run her old ass
out to the ATM

04:10.510 --> 04:12.411
and then bring it back
in a jiff, all right?

04:12.446 --> 04:13.546
I don't want your money,
Louis.

04:13.581 --> 04:14.547
I just want you to--

04:14.582 --> 04:16.683
I was not here.
I was not here.

04:16.716 --> 04:20.221
I was not here.

04:20.255 --> 04:21.656
All right,
let's get started, shall we?

04:21.690 --> 04:24.058
Isn't Harvey Specter
leading this deposition?

04:24.093 --> 04:26.460
He sent me.

04:26.495 --> 04:28.729
Now, Mr. Perkins,

04:28.764 --> 04:31.665
my first question to you is...

04:31.700 --> 04:35.003
Do you sleep well at night?

04:35.037 --> 04:36.571
Of course you do,

04:36.605 --> 04:39.608
'cause you have a roof
and a bed and running water,

04:39.642 --> 04:41.577
and by contrast,
thousands of families

04:41.611 --> 04:43.011
are gonna be sleeping
on the street

04:43.046 --> 04:45.414
when Stable Shelters is forced
to suspend their operations,

04:45.448 --> 04:48.050
all because of the money
that you stole.

04:48.084 --> 04:49.352
I never stole anything.

04:49.386 --> 04:50.453
You're Mazlo's number two.

04:50.487 --> 04:52.388
Money was embezzled.
Do you deny that?

04:52.422 --> 04:53.923
- Absolutely.
- Please, Robert,

04:53.957 --> 04:56.258
I know as general counsel
you just basically push paper,

04:56.293 --> 04:58.828
but please warn Mr. Perkins
about the penalties of perjury.

04:58.862 --> 05:00.930
Look, I'm not aware
of any perjury.

05:00.964 --> 05:02.498
We know about your account
in the Caymans.

05:02.533 --> 05:04.233
$20 million.
Are you kidding me?

05:04.268 --> 05:06.268
That transaction
was legitimate.

05:06.303 --> 05:08.504
Oh, when I take this public,
you're gonna be disgraced.

05:08.538 --> 05:12.174
Your wife, your children,
your whole family, disgraced.

05:12.209 --> 05:13.776
Would you show my client
some respect--

05:13.810 --> 05:16.345
And that transaction
had nothing to do with the firm.

05:16.380 --> 05:17.413
Bullshit.

05:17.447 --> 05:18.914
You either
took your cut from Mazlo,

05:18.949 --> 05:20.215
or it was hush money.

05:20.249 --> 05:21.382
Either way,
you're gonna live

05:21.417 --> 05:22.684
the rest of your life
as a pariah,

05:22.718 --> 05:24.052
or you give up Mazlo now.

05:24.086 --> 05:25.653
Is this a deposition
or an inquisition?

05:25.687 --> 05:27.855
This is ridiculous.
I can show you the records.

05:27.890 --> 05:29.857
Oh, sure you can.
Because you're the guy

05:29.892 --> 05:31.792
who invented losses
in mortgage-backed securities

05:31.827 --> 05:33.528
when you never even
bought them.

05:33.562 --> 05:35.329
I had no part in that.

05:35.364 --> 05:37.599
But you were aware of it,
and you did nothing about it.

05:37.633 --> 05:39.333
Come on, Louis.

05:39.368 --> 05:40.735
Can I get
a glass of water, please?

05:40.769 --> 05:43.738
You can't get any water.
We don't have any.

05:43.772 --> 05:45.973
You give up Mazlo now,
and this all stops.

05:46.008 --> 05:47.308
All right, that's--
that's it.

05:47.342 --> 05:48.309
My client needs a break.

05:48.343 --> 05:50.077
We can continue this
in ten minutes.

05:50.111 --> 05:54.214
I'm just getting started.

05:54.248 --> 05:55.949
I don't get it.
She looks so sweet.

05:55.983 --> 05:57.617
Don't let the photo
fool you.

05:57.651 --> 05:58.818
She's less "Girl Next Door"

05:58.852 --> 06:00.553
and more
"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."

06:00.587 --> 06:01.787
Mm.

06:01.822 --> 06:03.856
Look, my plate's full
with Stable Shelters.

06:03.890 --> 06:05.791
I need you to look
into Jerome's daughter.

06:05.825 --> 06:08.060
Why didn't you just
hire a private investigator?

06:08.095 --> 06:09.262
Because if there's a problem,

06:09.296 --> 06:11.064
an investigator
can't fix it.

06:11.098 --> 06:13.300
I'm not just a lawyer
to Jerome, okay?

06:13.334 --> 06:17.405
I'm--I'm more like
Robert Duvall in <i>The Godfather.</i>

06:17.439 --> 06:19.374
His consigliere.

06:19.408 --> 06:21.576
Okay.

06:21.611 --> 06:22.644
What?

06:22.678 --> 06:24.180
Uh, nothing.

06:24.214 --> 06:26.415
Just if you're
his Robert Duvall,

06:26.449 --> 06:27.649
you're coming to me,

06:27.684 --> 06:29.918
so technically
I'm your Robert Duvall.

06:29.952 --> 06:32.688
You're my Fredo.

06:32.722 --> 06:35.991
Fredo?
No.

06:40.062 --> 06:42.597
Robert, what the hell
happened to Perkins?

06:42.631 --> 06:47.469
Ask that pit bull of yours.

06:47.503 --> 06:48.904
Uh, oh, no, actually.

06:48.938 --> 06:51.573
I prefer a female masseuse?

06:51.608 --> 06:53.275
If that--
can I call you right back?

06:53.310 --> 06:54.910
Right back.
Okay, bye.

06:54.945 --> 06:57.614
Perkins just got
wheeled out on stretcher.

06:57.648 --> 06:59.049
Well, he couldn't
handle the heat.

06:59.083 --> 07:00.050
He's probably faking it.

07:00.084 --> 07:01.051
What were you thinking,

07:01.085 --> 07:03.554
starting that deposition
without me?

07:03.588 --> 07:05.389
I don't know. Maybe if
you were doing your jo--

07:05.423 --> 07:07.224
- Oh, no.
- What?

07:07.258 --> 07:09.793
It's from Geller.
Perkins wasn't faking anything.

07:09.827 --> 07:12.569
Our best chance
to nail Anthony Mazlo's dead.

07:48.995 --> 07:50.663
Well, he blew off
the deposition,

07:50.697 --> 07:52.364
so I was just
picking up the slack.

07:52.398 --> 07:54.367
I was letting Perkins sweat.

07:54.401 --> 07:56.736
It was a tactic,
which you completely undermined.

07:56.770 --> 07:59.472
Well, I believe
I made him sweat and then some.

07:59.506 --> 08:01.040
Are you actually proud
of what you did?

08:01.075 --> 08:02.308
As far as I'm concerned,

08:02.342 --> 08:03.609
whatever happened to that guy

08:03.644 --> 08:05.178
was a result
of his own guilt,

08:05.212 --> 08:06.513
and I will not apologize

08:06.547 --> 08:09.449
for deposing a criminal
in a vigorous manner.

08:09.483 --> 08:12.284
Losing Perkins
is a complication.

08:12.319 --> 08:14.120
We're just gonna
have to work harder

08:14.154 --> 08:15.687
to unearth
Mazlo's money trail.

08:15.722 --> 08:17.189
As for what happened,

08:17.223 --> 08:18.690
I've spoken to the hospital,

08:18.725 --> 08:21.527
and cause of death
was a pulmonary embolism.

08:21.561 --> 08:22.661
It was nothing you did.

08:22.695 --> 08:25.530
Would it be okay
if I took the credit?

08:25.565 --> 08:27.232
Louis, I need
to have a word with Harvey.

08:27.266 --> 08:29.601
Okay.

08:36.676 --> 08:39.311
Financial crime
is that man's forte.

08:39.345 --> 08:41.179
Yes,
he overstepped his rank,

08:41.212 --> 08:43.548
but I'm not about to throw
the baby out with the bathwater.

08:43.582 --> 08:44.915
Louis is the bathwater.

08:44.950 --> 08:46.217
Believe it or not,
Harvey,

08:46.251 --> 08:48.253
you can be a real pain
in the ass to work with too.

08:48.287 --> 08:49.721
Oh, I get along
with me just fine.

08:49.755 --> 08:52.124
Yes, well, I'm not about
to tell Lucille Jackson

08:52.158 --> 08:54.894
that we didn't win because
we couldn't work together.

08:54.928 --> 08:57.196
You need to figure out
how to collaborate with Louis.

09:06.506 --> 09:09.375
So the name
on Lola Jensen's fake I.D.

09:09.409 --> 09:10.909
wasn't just pulled
from thin air.

09:10.943 --> 09:12.377
Belongs to an
assistant controller

09:12.411 --> 09:13.645
at Clarity Drilling.

09:13.679 --> 09:15.113
You're telling me this why?

09:15.147 --> 09:17.148
You wanted me
to look into it.

09:17.183 --> 09:19.317
I didn't ask you
to explain the problem to me.

09:19.351 --> 09:20.752
I asked you to fix it for me.

09:20.786 --> 09:23.188
Hey, did Louis
really kill a guy?

09:23.222 --> 09:26.190
Is that what the associate
rumor mill's been churning out?

09:26.225 --> 09:27.759
Actually,
I think he started it.

09:27.793 --> 09:30.061
Yeah, he also claims
that he's 6'2"

09:30.096 --> 09:32.664
with a full head of hair.

09:32.699 --> 09:36.702
Louis with hair.
That's good.

09:39.406 --> 09:40.940
How'd you get past Donna?

09:40.974 --> 09:42.942
You waited till she peed,
didn't you?

09:42.976 --> 09:46.145
I mean, the woman
retains water like a camel.

09:46.179 --> 09:49.548
I see that the, uh,
greatest band of all time

09:49.583 --> 09:51.083
is conspicuously absent.

09:51.117 --> 09:53.218
And who would that be,
Louis?

09:53.252 --> 09:54.286
Oh, I don't know.

09:54.320 --> 09:55.287
A little British band
called Queen?

09:55.321 --> 09:56.455
Should have seen that coming.

09:56.490 --> 09:57.723
You know, real musicians,

09:57.758 --> 09:59.258
they don't wear eyeliner.

09:59.292 --> 10:00.693
Oh, really?
Why don't you tell that

10:00.727 --> 10:02.128
to the artist
formerly known as Prince,

10:02.162 --> 10:04.963
who's...
Once again named Prince?

10:04.997 --> 10:06.298
What do you want, Louis?

10:06.332 --> 10:08.199
Well, I think
now that we're working together,

10:08.234 --> 10:09.334
we should set
some ground rules.

10:09.368 --> 10:11.903
First rule,
never touch my records.

10:11.938 --> 10:13.772
Or anything else
in this office.

10:13.806 --> 10:16.774
Fine.

10:16.809 --> 10:19.610
That includes the furniture.

10:19.645 --> 10:23.047
I'm trying to build
a rapport with you.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.315
Okay?

10:24.349 --> 10:26.918
I mean, I think our relationship
needs a little work.

10:26.953 --> 10:28.487
Let's hold off
the couples counseling

10:28.521 --> 10:29.855
until our fifth anniversary.

10:29.889 --> 10:31.790
Don't you think?

10:31.825 --> 10:35.560
Look, Mazlo's lawyer
moved to push up the trial.

10:35.595 --> 10:38.063
They know we need time
to cultivate another witness.

10:38.097 --> 10:39.431
Well, I say we bluff.

10:39.465 --> 10:42.134
I mean,
Perkins implicated Mazlo

10:42.168 --> 10:43.768
the minute his lawyer
walked out of the room.

10:43.803 --> 10:45.070
That's hearsay, Louis.

10:45.104 --> 10:46.338
Not if it's
a deathbed confession.

10:46.372 --> 10:49.307
Maybe while Geller
was making the 911 call,

10:49.342 --> 10:52.577
I had a little
conversation with Perkins.

10:52.612 --> 10:54.446
So you want to lie
about what Perkins said

10:54.480 --> 10:55.781
and how he said it?

10:55.816 --> 10:57.383
Well, what's your brilliant
solution, Harvey?

10:57.417 --> 10:58.984
I'm having the money
in Perkins' account

10:59.019 --> 11:01.087
traced as we speak, and I have
another witness in mind.

11:01.121 --> 11:02.555
I get Anthony Mazlo
across that table,

11:02.589 --> 11:03.823
you know I'll break him.

11:03.857 --> 11:05.458
- The way you broke Perkins?
- Yeah, if need be.

11:05.492 --> 11:06.459
You're not hearing me.

11:06.493 --> 11:08.094
We need to hold off
on any meeting.

11:08.128 --> 11:09.095
I don't--

11:09.129 --> 11:10.963
That's final, Louis.

11:23.009 --> 11:26.078
Question. Why would someone
named Lola Jensen

11:26.112 --> 11:29.382
ever want to be known
as Mildred Wisnewski?

11:29.416 --> 11:30.816
Who are you?

11:30.851 --> 11:33.052
My name's Mike Ross.
I'm a lawyer.

11:33.087 --> 11:35.288
Let me guess.
Pearson Hardman?

11:38.592 --> 11:41.027
You know, forging a government
document like this

11:41.061 --> 11:43.830
after 911
is next to impossible.

11:43.864 --> 11:47.400
God, there must have been
a glitch at the DMV.

11:47.434 --> 11:48.968
Why'd you come here?

11:49.002 --> 11:51.236
Your father came to us
'cause he's worried about you.

11:51.271 --> 11:52.838
He's not worried.
He'd be here himself.

11:52.872 --> 11:54.740
He wouldn't have sent
an empty suit.

11:58.911 --> 12:00.345
You don't know anything
about me.

12:00.379 --> 12:01.980
I, on the other hand,

12:02.014 --> 12:03.481
know that you used this I.D.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.649
to funnel payments
from Clarity Drilling

12:05.683 --> 12:07.518
to some fake company
that you set up.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.153
Locksley LLC?

12:09.187 --> 12:11.188
You're stealing money
from your father's company.

12:11.223 --> 12:14.826
Couple million so far.

12:14.861 --> 12:15.894
I don't need to know why,

12:15.929 --> 12:17.429
but I do need you
to return it. Now.

12:17.464 --> 12:19.932
Actually,
you do need to know why.

12:19.967 --> 12:21.701
This is ground water

12:21.735 --> 12:24.938
from Clarity's fracking
operation south of Tulsa.

12:24.972 --> 12:27.374
It's got elevated levels
of dibutoxyethanol,

12:27.408 --> 12:30.077
methane, and benzene.

12:30.111 --> 12:33.212
This compares samples
taken pre-drilling

12:33.247 --> 12:34.847
to levels taken last week.

12:34.882 --> 12:37.550
How did you get that?
That's classified company data.

12:37.584 --> 12:40.352
Let's just say
I'm good with computers.

12:40.387 --> 12:42.121
Wait a minute.
Locksley LLC.

12:42.155 --> 12:44.890
As in Robin of Locksley,
as in Robin Hood.

12:44.924 --> 12:46.925
These toxins are known
to cause kidney failure,

12:46.959 --> 12:48.827
liver cancer,
and infertility.

12:48.861 --> 12:50.928
The EPA fines
were a slap on the wrist,

12:50.963 --> 12:52.830
but the settlement
that your firm

12:52.865 --> 12:54.131
negotiated with the victims--

12:54.166 --> 12:56.067
It doesn't matter
how pure your motives are.

12:56.101 --> 12:58.169
You're committing
a very serious crime.

12:58.203 --> 12:59.838
Threaten all you want.
Okay?

12:59.872 --> 13:02.641
There's no way that my father's
gonna let this go public

13:02.676 --> 13:04.076
right before his IPO.

13:04.110 --> 13:06.946
I'm not giving the money back.

13:06.981 --> 13:09.082
I'm giving it away.

13:12.553 --> 13:14.687
In terms of living relatives,
I didn't find anything,

13:14.722 --> 13:16.122
but when I looked into
the estates

13:16.156 --> 13:18.324
of relatives who passed away,

13:18.358 --> 13:20.893
the holding was originally
in the name of the aunt.

13:20.927 --> 13:22.695
Your theory on Perkins
is right.

13:22.729 --> 13:24.430
Harvey,
what are you doing?

13:24.464 --> 13:26.632
Rachel's services
are under my purview.

13:26.666 --> 13:28.367
Sorry.
I'm gonna change that.

13:28.401 --> 13:31.669
Anthony Mazlo and his attorney
are in the conference room.

13:31.704 --> 13:33.138
At whose invitation?

13:33.172 --> 13:36.008
Oh, what,
you think I called 'em?

13:36.042 --> 13:37.109
I--I didn't.

13:37.143 --> 13:39.378
Then Mazlo feels
he has an advantage.

13:39.412 --> 13:42.982
And he's pressing it.

13:43.017 --> 13:44.317
Hey, fellas.

13:44.351 --> 13:46.353
Thanks for meeting us
on such short notice.

13:46.387 --> 13:48.689
I figured you'd be on a flight
right now, Mr. Mazlo.

13:48.723 --> 13:50.591
Somewhere with no
extradition agreement.

13:50.626 --> 13:51.993
Let's get to the point.

13:52.027 --> 13:54.028
Without Perkins,
you don't have a case.

13:54.062 --> 13:55.262
This report summarizes

13:55.296 --> 13:57.430
an internal investigation
we conducted.

13:57.465 --> 13:58.698
What Inez
has just handed you

13:58.732 --> 14:00.867
is hard evidence
of fraudulent investments

14:00.901 --> 14:02.302
and fake losses
perpetrated by Perkins.

14:02.336 --> 14:04.437
Guys have a real penchant
for fiction, don't you?

14:04.472 --> 14:05.805
No, he duped all of us.

14:05.840 --> 14:09.009
As CEO, he betrayed me
just as much as the investors.

14:09.043 --> 14:11.010
We found an offshore account
worth 20 million.

14:11.045 --> 14:12.011
Hold on a second.

14:12.045 --> 14:13.078
Lucille Jackson trusts you

14:13.113 --> 14:14.713
to manage
a $150 million endowment.

14:14.748 --> 14:15.882
Perkins takes 20.

14:15.916 --> 14:17.417
Where the hell's
the rest of it?

14:17.451 --> 14:18.518
In light of these findings,

14:18.552 --> 14:20.353
we'd like to offer
a settlement.

14:20.387 --> 14:22.321
15 million.

14:22.355 --> 14:23.722
Ten cents on the dollar?

14:23.756 --> 14:24.723
That's a slap in the face.

14:24.757 --> 14:26.424
Well,
we advise all our clients

14:26.459 --> 14:27.925
that investments carry risk.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.394
You want a risk-free return,
buy Treasury bills,

14:30.429 --> 14:32.129
or, I don't know,
hide your money

14:32.164 --> 14:33.398
under the mattress.

14:33.432 --> 14:36.834
While you were writing
the great American novel,

14:36.868 --> 14:38.736
I've been checking facts.

14:38.771 --> 14:41.339
The 20 million
that Perkins had overseas

14:41.373 --> 14:42.807
was legitimate.

14:42.841 --> 14:45.777
He was innocent.

14:45.811 --> 14:48.213
The money your firm embezzled
is still out there,

14:48.247 --> 14:49.547
and this so-called
investigation

14:49.582 --> 14:52.250
isn't worth the paper
it's printed on.

14:52.284 --> 14:55.386
Well, Lucille Jackson
may beg to differ, counselor.

14:55.421 --> 14:57.722
A bridge loan
means she's desperate.

14:57.756 --> 14:59.757
Our offer is non-negotiable.

14:59.792 --> 15:02.894
I won't accept this offer
today or a year from now.

15:02.928 --> 15:05.096
Now since you've all
invited yourselves over,

15:05.130 --> 15:06.731
feel free to see
yourselves out.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.670
So first you attack me for
wanting to lie about Perkins,

15:16.671 --> 15:18.606
and then you turn around,
do the same exact thing?

15:18.640 --> 15:20.307
I wasn't lying.

15:20.342 --> 15:22.610
What are you saying to me?

15:22.644 --> 15:24.178
Harvey, what the hell
are you saying to me?

15:24.212 --> 15:25.980
That Perkins had no
involvement whatsoever?

15:26.014 --> 15:27.581
That's exactly
what I'm saying, Louis.

15:27.615 --> 15:29.650
He was innocent.

15:37.094 --> 15:39.023
It's no surprise
that Mazlo low-balled us.

15:39.024 --> 15:43.527
I'm just passing along
this offer as a formality.

15:43.562 --> 15:46.864
$15 million
is not insignificant.

15:46.899 --> 15:48.299
But now's not the time
to settle.

15:48.334 --> 15:50.001
We have to strengthen
our hand.

15:50.035 --> 15:52.103
All right,
here's my problem.

15:52.137 --> 15:53.337
Best-case scenario.

15:53.372 --> 15:56.040
We go to trial,
the jury awards us a settlement,

15:56.074 --> 15:57.841
obviously Mazlo appeals that.

15:57.876 --> 15:59.676
It's three years
before I see any money,

15:59.711 --> 16:01.445
and my foundation's
long gone by that point.

16:01.479 --> 16:02.946
No, I'm not gonna let Mazlo

16:02.980 --> 16:04.915
pocket the lion's share
of your endowment.

16:04.949 --> 16:06.750
I'm not interested
in a Pyrrhic victory.

16:06.785 --> 16:08.519
Neither are we.

16:08.554 --> 16:11.323
And to prove it, we're gonna
forego our usual fee,

16:11.357 --> 16:13.692
and return to you the money
you've already paid.

16:13.726 --> 16:19.065
I grew up
sleeping in my mama's car.

16:19.100 --> 16:22.803
And in and out of more
halfway houses than I can count,

16:22.837 --> 16:26.374
and one thing I realized
is that every penny matters.

16:26.408 --> 16:29.710
So thank you.

16:29.744 --> 16:31.412
What you gonna do?

16:31.446 --> 16:33.247
Perkins may
have been innocent,

16:33.281 --> 16:34.882
but he was still
Mazlo's direct report.

16:34.916 --> 16:36.450
I'm gonna find out
what he knew.

16:36.485 --> 16:39.153
Your job is to verify
every detail

16:39.188 --> 16:41.289
of Mazlo's
internal investigation.

16:41.323 --> 16:44.226
It is not about the crime now.
It's about the cover-up.

16:44.260 --> 16:45.427
This says
Perkins acted alone.

16:45.462 --> 16:46.762
Well, he's
the perfect scapegoat.

16:46.796 --> 16:47.997
He can't defend himself.

16:48.031 --> 16:49.231
You want to go
to the bathroom?

16:49.266 --> 16:51.734
You don't bother coming back.

16:51.769 --> 16:54.505
By the way, that goes
for personal phone calls,

16:54.539 --> 16:56.106
emails, and texts.

16:56.141 --> 16:58.442
I detect a whiff of slacking,

16:58.477 --> 17:02.047
you are done.
Get it?

17:02.081 --> 17:04.048
You find anything,
I'll be in my office.

17:07.486 --> 17:10.721
Louis. Uh, I'm still
working on Harvey's case.

17:10.755 --> 17:13.089
Jerome Jensen can go
screw himself for all I care.

17:13.124 --> 17:14.490
Well, Harvey
explicitly told me--

17:14.525 --> 17:16.291
I don't care if
a burning bush told you, Mike.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.327
The only commandments
you need to focus on right now

17:18.361 --> 17:21.563
come from me.

17:21.598 --> 17:23.965
There's something wrong
with Louis.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.867
It's not my problem.
I answer to Harvey.

17:25.902 --> 17:28.204
...Sitting home alone
with your kids, with no job.

17:28.238 --> 17:29.305
Harvey.

17:29.340 --> 17:30.774
You solve
Jerome's problem yet?

17:30.808 --> 17:32.876
Uh, about to. But I need
your corporate card first.

17:32.910 --> 17:34.411
What for?

17:34.446 --> 17:36.848
Well, I thought you didn't
want me to explain it to you.

17:36.882 --> 17:39.917
You're right.
I don't.

17:42.188 --> 17:44.522
Okay.

17:46.625 --> 17:47.992
It's killing you not knowing

17:48.026 --> 17:49.426
what I'm gonna use this for,
isn't it?

17:49.461 --> 17:50.795
Nope.

17:50.829 --> 17:51.962
Please let me tell you.

17:51.997 --> 17:53.397
If you bring that
back to me

17:53.431 --> 17:54.498
and it smells like stripper,

17:54.532 --> 17:55.499
you're fired.

17:57.868 --> 18:00.369
I don't--I don't go
to places like that.

18:03.373 --> 18:04.406
You had to send someone?

18:04.441 --> 18:08.377
Couldn't just call me?

18:08.412 --> 18:09.879
If you wanted this
to be private,

18:09.913 --> 18:11.180
should have just robbed me.

18:11.214 --> 18:12.814
You robbed the company,
I had to involve other people.

18:12.849 --> 18:15.116
Okay.
Why don't we take a seat?

18:15.150 --> 18:17.718
Why are you here?

18:17.753 --> 18:19.453
I want to tell you
my side of things.

18:19.488 --> 18:20.688
Okay.

18:20.722 --> 18:21.756
I'm not proud of the fact

18:21.790 --> 18:23.858
that we contaminated
people's water.

18:23.893 --> 18:25.393
But we apologized.

18:25.428 --> 18:27.563
We implemented safeguards.

18:27.597 --> 18:30.466
We negotiated a payout
that was more than generous.

18:30.501 --> 18:31.568
If that's what you think,

18:31.602 --> 18:33.570
then you are lying
to yourself.

18:33.604 --> 18:35.238
I think that
we could keep this civil--

18:35.273 --> 18:36.406
No, she's right.
It's true.

18:36.441 --> 18:37.941
I am lying to myself.

18:37.976 --> 18:39.977
I thought this was a phase,

18:40.011 --> 18:42.379
that it was hormones,
that it would pass,

18:42.413 --> 18:44.481
but the truth is...

18:44.515 --> 18:45.915
I raised a thief.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.951
Okay, I think we're gonna
need a minute. Thank you.

18:47.985 --> 18:49.286
A thief.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.488
My research is making the planet
more habitable, okay?

18:51.522 --> 18:54.591
You are making money
destroying it.

18:54.625 --> 18:56.626
You have no respect for me,
that's fine.

18:56.661 --> 18:58.862
But at least
respect the workers.

18:58.896 --> 19:00.363
You're stealing from them too.

19:00.398 --> 19:03.400
You think I'm such a criminal?
Arrest me.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.669
So I organized this so that
you two could clear the air,

19:05.703 --> 19:07.404
and it seems we've gotten
off the wrong foot...

19:07.439 --> 19:09.407
You know what? It's the same
story as always, Dad.

19:09.441 --> 19:13.645
You duck
your responsibilities.

19:13.679 --> 19:15.714
Lo--Lola.

19:22.155 --> 19:24.122
What if I paid the company
back with my own money?

19:24.157 --> 19:26.424
I don't think that
would be a very good idea.

19:26.459 --> 19:27.725
It would make you
a conspirator.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.327
I'm not turning my daughter
into the police.

19:29.361 --> 19:30.862
This is not about
the company image.

19:30.896 --> 19:32.030
Well, the good news is,

19:32.064 --> 19:33.464
she hasn't distributed
the money--

19:33.499 --> 19:36.968
The money is irrelevant.

19:37.002 --> 19:40.805
I came to Pearson Hardman
to take care of this.

19:40.839 --> 19:44.075
Instead, my daughter and I
are further apart than ever.

19:48.780 --> 19:51.783
I can't imagine
how hard it is right now.

19:51.818 --> 19:55.421
People are saying the most
horrible things about Elliot.

19:55.455 --> 19:58.090
They must think
I've gone deaf.

19:58.125 --> 20:00.994
Anthony Mazlo has been
dragging your husband's name

20:01.028 --> 20:04.230
through the mud to make him
a scapegoat, Mrs. Perkins.

20:04.264 --> 20:06.066
I'm here to help.

20:06.100 --> 20:07.067
I don't understand.

20:07.101 --> 20:08.267
You work for the other side.

20:08.302 --> 20:10.202
I work for
a charitable organization

20:10.236 --> 20:12.538
that had all its money stolen.

20:12.572 --> 20:15.306
I'm on the other side of
Anthony Mazlo, not your husband,

20:15.341 --> 20:16.607
and I don't want
to see his memory

20:16.642 --> 20:18.609
painted with the same brush.

20:18.644 --> 20:21.445
What would I have to do?

20:21.479 --> 20:22.779
This isn't the time
or the place.

20:22.814 --> 20:25.382
No, it's okay.
What would I have to do?

20:25.416 --> 20:26.550
I'd like to know everything

20:26.584 --> 20:29.119
Elliot has ever
told you about Mazlo.

20:29.153 --> 20:32.689
Any details would help.

20:32.724 --> 20:35.292
Miss Perkins,
uh, I'm Louis Litt,

20:35.326 --> 20:36.493
and I just want
to let you know

20:36.527 --> 20:37.961
that I'm going to do
whatever it takes

20:37.996 --> 20:40.330
to clear your husband's name.

20:40.365 --> 20:41.932
His name?

20:41.966 --> 20:45.202
My husband
would be alive today

20:45.236 --> 20:46.203
if it weren't for you.

20:46.237 --> 20:47.438
Well,
we don't know that.

20:47.472 --> 20:49.540
I know what happened
in that room.

20:49.574 --> 20:51.509
Well, at the time,
we didn't have all the facts,

20:51.543 --> 20:55.378
but now we do.

20:55.413 --> 20:57.915
I can't believe
that you have the audacity

20:57.949 --> 20:59.816
to come here.

20:59.851 --> 21:04.221
I don't ever want
to see your face again.

21:04.255 --> 21:06.457
And you can forget
about me helping you.

21:11.597 --> 21:12.731
What the hell
are you doing?

21:12.765 --> 21:15.100
I was deposing the widow,
just like you.

21:15.134 --> 21:18.371
I came here to pay my respects
and initiate a relationship,

21:18.405 --> 21:20.339
not aggravate
a grieving woman.

21:20.374 --> 21:21.674
Yeah, I brought flowers.

21:21.708 --> 21:24.577
You just cost us
a potential witness.

21:24.611 --> 21:25.845
Oh, really?

21:25.879 --> 21:28.480
Well, maybe--maybe if you shared
your game plan with me--

21:28.515 --> 21:30.615
Oh, the same way that you
shared your game plan with me?

21:30.650 --> 21:33.852
How do you expect her
to react to seeing you?

21:33.886 --> 21:36.453
You need to get
your shit together

21:36.488 --> 21:38.789
and find us a new witness.

21:52.504 --> 21:54.672
Lola.

21:54.707 --> 21:57.542
Wanted to apologize
for earlier today.

21:57.577 --> 21:59.144
Can I come in?

21:59.178 --> 22:01.447
Uh, yeah.
Of course.

22:01.481 --> 22:04.349
Nice gesture.
Botanical Gardens.

22:04.384 --> 22:06.751
Yeah, he said it was a pretty
special place for you guys.

22:06.785 --> 22:10.021
It was.
And then he became CEO.

22:10.055 --> 22:12.590
But I'm not here
to reminisce.

22:12.624 --> 22:15.660
I must say I was, uh,
really impressed

22:15.694 --> 22:17.995
you figured out
what I was doing.

22:18.030 --> 22:21.031
Especially since you're
not even a real lawyer.

22:21.066 --> 22:22.633
What--what are you
talking about?

22:22.667 --> 22:25.903
I accessed Harvard
Law School's Alumni Directory.

22:25.937 --> 22:28.806
Every class that graduated
for the last ten years.

22:28.840 --> 22:32.175
No record of Mike Ross.
At all.

22:32.209 --> 22:34.177
Yeah, the Dean's office
was supposed to fix that.

22:34.211 --> 22:36.579
They--they put my name wrong
in the system.

22:36.613 --> 22:38.414
I checked your
social security number

22:38.449 --> 22:39.582
against the database.

22:39.616 --> 22:41.451
How'd you get my social
security number?

22:41.486 --> 22:44.487
Easily.
Here's the deal.

22:44.522 --> 22:47.791
Leave me alone,
or I expose you.

22:58.032 --> 23:00.389
You don't really seem
that worried about this.

23:00.390 --> 23:01.964
Threats like hers
are a tactic.

23:01.965 --> 23:04.166
They're effective
because they distract you

23:04.200 --> 23:05.567
from what you're
supposed to be doing.

23:05.601 --> 23:06.701
Are you crazy?

23:06.736 --> 23:08.537
What we should be doing
is backing the hell off.

23:08.572 --> 23:09.638
And how would that go, huh?

23:09.663 --> 23:11.404
Uh, Jerome, you came
to us with a problem.

23:11.540 --> 23:12.907
"We discovered that
your daughter

23:12.942 --> 23:14.575
"stole $2 million
from your company,

23:14.610 --> 23:16.644
and our conclusion is
you're shit out of luck"?

23:16.678 --> 23:18.479
I don't really care
how it would go.

23:18.514 --> 23:19.780
All I care about
is my life,

23:19.815 --> 23:21.382
and--and keeping our secret.

23:21.416 --> 23:23.718
I told you,
it's a distraction.

23:23.752 --> 23:25.854
She won't pull that trigger.

23:25.889 --> 23:27.990
Why do you think she hasn't
distributed that money yet?

23:28.024 --> 23:30.559
Why do you think Jerome doesn't
want us to go to the police?

23:30.593 --> 23:31.893
I don't know.

23:31.928 --> 23:34.096
It's because they both
want to bury the hatchet,

23:34.130 --> 23:36.765
and if any of that stuff
happens, they can't.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.267
Then what?

23:38.301 --> 23:40.369
Figure out a way
to make them reconcile.

23:40.403 --> 23:42.905
It's easy.

23:42.939 --> 23:45.273
Yeah.
It's easy.

23:45.308 --> 23:47.408
Inez, right?
Louis Litt.

23:47.443 --> 23:48.409
I know who you are.

23:48.444 --> 23:50.511
So is this what you do
for Mazlo?

23:50.546 --> 23:51.612
You clean up
his dirty laundry?

23:51.647 --> 23:52.880
Leave me alone.

23:52.915 --> 23:54.648
You know, you have
your whole career ahead of you.

23:54.683 --> 23:56.783
Mazlo goes down and you're
part of this cover-up,

23:56.818 --> 23:57.784
no one's gonna hire you.

23:57.819 --> 23:59.019
I can't help you.

23:59.053 --> 24:00.820
Listen, can I just
tell you something, Inez?

24:00.855 --> 24:02.922
In my experience, people respond
to two things, okay?

24:02.957 --> 24:05.024
And that's the carrot
and the stick.

24:05.059 --> 24:06.159
Now, I prefer the stick,

24:06.193 --> 24:07.594
and if you do not help me,

24:07.628 --> 24:10.029
I will devote
my considerable expertise

24:10.064 --> 24:11.831
to sticking it to you.

24:11.866 --> 24:13.967
The same way
you stuck it to Perkins.

24:17.237 --> 24:22.107
Inez, stop.

24:22.142 --> 24:24.677
Let's go with the carrot.

24:28.347 --> 24:31.382
Inez, Harvey Specter.

24:31.417 --> 24:33.751
I appreciate you
coming forward.

24:33.785 --> 24:35.953
I should have
done it sooner.

24:35.987 --> 24:37.321
What changed?

24:37.355 --> 24:41.024
I can't be a part
of a company like that anymore.

24:41.059 --> 24:43.427
Are you ready to testify
against Anthony Mazlo

24:43.461 --> 24:45.196
in open court?

24:45.230 --> 24:47.065
I am.

24:47.099 --> 24:49.000
I assume you've documented
his malfeasance.

24:49.034 --> 24:51.570
Because otherwise it's
he said, she said.

24:55.109 --> 24:56.676
The entire paper trail.

24:56.710 --> 24:58.745
From the beginning
all the way to last week.

25:02.549 --> 25:04.717
Harvey asked me to fix
this problem with Lola,

25:04.751 --> 25:07.686
but I can't.

25:07.720 --> 25:11.456
Because your daughter's
not the problem, Mr. Jensen.

25:11.490 --> 25:15.492
You are.

25:15.527 --> 25:16.994
Are you trying to get fired?

25:17.028 --> 25:19.263
No. I'm not.

25:19.297 --> 25:21.231
I'm your attorney.

25:21.266 --> 25:22.966
It's my job
to give you advice.

25:23.001 --> 25:25.570
But you're her father.

25:25.604 --> 25:27.205
It's your job to raise her.

25:27.239 --> 25:28.540
Now, you can go
to another firm,

25:28.574 --> 25:30.409
but there's not a lawyer
in the city

25:30.443 --> 25:31.610
that can do
that job for you.

25:31.644 --> 25:34.513
Please don't lecture me
on parenting.

25:34.547 --> 25:37.616
Mr. Jensen, I had a difficult
relationship with my father,

25:37.651 --> 25:39.285
so trust me when I tell you

25:39.319 --> 25:40.920
that Lola
wants to forgive you,

25:40.954 --> 25:43.056
but she needs you
to take the first step.

25:43.090 --> 25:44.457
Well, we tried it your way.

25:44.492 --> 25:48.362
We went to lunch, and you saw
how well that worked out.

25:48.396 --> 25:50.798
My daughter's not a child.

25:50.833 --> 25:52.233
She's an adult.

25:52.268 --> 25:54.403
She made these choices
as an adult.

25:54.437 --> 25:55.704
If you just
found a way...

25:55.738 --> 25:58.974
You're my lawyer.
This is a legal problem.

26:01.010 --> 26:05.447
My daughter
brought this on herself.

26:05.481 --> 26:08.583
Now, I desperately do not want
her to go to prison.

26:08.618 --> 26:11.320
But if she doesn't
return the money, she will.

26:15.524 --> 26:16.891
Where's Mazlo?

26:16.926 --> 26:19.661
He was afraid
to face us himself?

26:19.695 --> 26:20.795
What do you want?

26:20.829 --> 26:23.698
We know about
your entire scheme.

26:23.732 --> 26:24.966
What scheme?

26:25.000 --> 26:26.868
Oh, the scheme where
Mazlo's laundering money

26:26.902 --> 26:29.337
through Dubai.

26:29.372 --> 26:31.439
How do you know
about Dubai?

26:31.474 --> 26:32.741
We cultivated
another source.

26:32.775 --> 26:35.143
What kind of settlement
are you looking for?

26:35.178 --> 26:39.581
One that includes
punitive damages.

26:39.615 --> 26:41.016
Send Inez in here,
please.

26:41.050 --> 26:43.218
I don't think
you'll find her at her desk.

26:43.252 --> 26:44.385
Why not?

26:44.420 --> 26:48.423
'Cause she agreed
to testify for us.

26:48.457 --> 26:51.126
I doubt that.

26:55.498 --> 26:57.032
When your colleague
approached her,

26:57.067 --> 26:58.167
she came straight to us.

26:58.202 --> 26:59.702
He even tried
to bribe me.

26:59.737 --> 27:01.738
He said if
I ratted out Mr. Mazlo,

27:01.773 --> 27:04.775
he'd get me a job as an
assistant to Jessica Pearson.

27:04.809 --> 27:07.311
Everything she told you
is a complete fabrication.

27:07.345 --> 27:09.713
There is no Dubai.

27:09.748 --> 27:12.182
I seem to recall
you mentioning something

27:12.217 --> 27:14.285
about penalties for perjury

27:14.319 --> 27:15.819
at our last meeting.

27:15.854 --> 27:20.291
Well, the penalty for bribing
a witness is just as severe.

27:20.325 --> 27:23.227
And we're willing to overlook
that indiscretion

27:23.261 --> 27:24.295
if you convince your client

27:24.329 --> 27:26.430
to take
our settlement offer.

27:26.465 --> 27:29.800
Well, our revised
settlement offer.

27:29.835 --> 27:31.736
- Revised?
- Yes.

27:31.770 --> 27:35.473
Exactly half
of what it was before.

27:42.735 --> 27:44.035
What the hell
were you thinking?

27:44.069 --> 27:45.236
We needed a new witness.

27:45.270 --> 27:46.837
You didn't think
to look into her story?

27:46.872 --> 27:48.239
I don't know.
Did you look into it?

27:48.273 --> 27:49.640
You were the one
who brought her in.

27:49.675 --> 27:50.641
I assumed you had.

27:50.675 --> 27:53.292
Like any halfway
decent lawyer would.

27:53.384 --> 27:54.518
We were under the gun.

27:54.552 --> 27:56.153
And I was under
strict instructions

27:56.187 --> 27:57.688
from my golf pro
to get another witness.

27:57.722 --> 27:59.623
No, I told you to <i>get</i>
another witness,

27:59.658 --> 28:00.624
not bribe one.

28:00.659 --> 28:01.859
That's enough.

28:01.893 --> 28:03.127
As for the threat
against Louis,

28:03.162 --> 28:04.329
no money changed hands.

28:04.363 --> 28:05.630
I'm not concerned
with Louis.

28:05.664 --> 28:07.465
He brought your name
into it, okay?

28:07.500 --> 28:09.100
The offer was to be
your assistant.

28:09.134 --> 28:11.803
Now you're exposed
because of what he did.

28:11.837 --> 28:12.804
Is that true?

28:12.838 --> 28:14.005
She's an executive assistant

28:14.039 --> 28:15.573
to the head of
a major investment firm.

28:15.608 --> 28:17.609
She's not gonna work
for a junior partner.

28:17.643 --> 28:18.610
So you tried to bribe her.

28:18.644 --> 28:20.010
No, it wasn't a bribe,
Jessica.

28:20.045 --> 28:21.812
It was an incentive.

28:21.847 --> 28:23.280
I thought she'd be
more likely to talk

28:23.315 --> 28:26.583
if she wasn't worried
about being fired.

28:26.618 --> 28:28.653
I want you to go to Mazlo
and take their offer.

28:28.687 --> 28:31.055
- I'm not ready to do that.
- I'm not either.

28:31.090 --> 28:32.757
I waived Lucille's fee

28:32.791 --> 28:34.292
because a certain
senior partner

28:34.326 --> 28:35.426
said we'd never go to trial.

28:35.461 --> 28:37.228
I said that before
you stuck me with Louis.

28:37.262 --> 28:38.429
Not the point.

28:38.463 --> 28:39.964
She can't afford it,
and neither can we.

28:39.998 --> 28:41.265
Give me time.

28:41.299 --> 28:43.100
Give it to me without Louis,

28:43.135 --> 28:45.035
and we'll see who can
afford it and who can't.

28:49.073 --> 28:50.740
You have until
the end of the day.

28:50.774 --> 28:52.241
You come up empty,

28:52.276 --> 28:54.510
I'm taking the offer
to Lucille myself.

28:58.414 --> 29:00.749
Jessica.
I went to Perkins--

29:00.783 --> 29:02.651
Not another word.

29:06.189 --> 29:07.556
You try something
like that again,

29:07.590 --> 29:10.726
and it will be your last day
at this firm.

29:20.538 --> 29:22.272
You said Jerome
wouldn't pull the trigger.

29:22.306 --> 29:23.840
You were wrong.
He's ready.

29:23.874 --> 29:25.274
I don't have time
for that right now.

29:25.308 --> 29:27.476
Harvey, when the police
show up at Lola's doorstep,

29:27.510 --> 29:29.077
we're done.

29:29.111 --> 29:31.080
Has she distributed
the money yet?

29:31.114 --> 29:32.248
No, she hasn't,
but she's--

29:32.282 --> 29:34.116
She hasn't,
and she won't,

29:34.151 --> 29:37.019
because what she wants
is her daddy's attention.

29:37.054 --> 29:39.088
Now sit down with me,
and let's deal with this.

29:39.122 --> 29:40.355
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

29:40.390 --> 29:42.858
Why don't you tell me
what you need?

29:42.892 --> 29:44.526
Mazlo was in Liechtenstein

29:44.560 --> 29:47.128
the day that Lucille's
endowment evaporated.

29:47.162 --> 29:48.262
Maybe he was skiing.

29:48.297 --> 29:51.465
Nobody goes to
Liechtenstein for pleasure.

29:51.499 --> 29:53.033
Why don't we subpoena
the bank records?

29:53.068 --> 29:54.101
How many banks can there be?

29:54.135 --> 29:56.570
Place is like
Switzerland on steroids.

29:56.604 --> 29:57.871
We'll never see those records.

29:57.906 --> 30:00.474
So what the hell
do you want from me, then?

30:00.509 --> 30:05.446
What did you
just say to me?

30:05.480 --> 30:08.049
I once suggested
that we hack Harvard's records

30:08.083 --> 30:11.053
to cover my ass,
and you laughed at me.

30:11.087 --> 30:12.621
And now it turns out
that you were wrong,

30:12.655 --> 30:14.656
and it's about
to cost me my career.

30:14.691 --> 30:16.325
Where are you going?

30:16.360 --> 30:17.927
You told me to fix my case.

30:17.961 --> 30:20.663
Why don't you fix yours?

30:53.596 --> 30:56.131
Hope you came here to tell me
Harvey's backing off.

30:56.166 --> 30:58.434
I wish I could,
but he's not.

30:58.468 --> 31:01.036
That's too bad.
Had such a promising career.

31:01.071 --> 31:02.237
Oh, my God.
God, Lola,

31:02.272 --> 31:03.906
you act like you care
about a higher cause,

31:03.940 --> 31:05.340
but of all the companies
that exist,

31:05.375 --> 31:06.708
you chose your dad's.

31:06.743 --> 31:08.744
Company that's trying
to make amends for what it did.

31:08.778 --> 31:10.445
Really don't need
to hear another speech

31:10.479 --> 31:12.113
from a wannabe suit.

31:12.148 --> 31:14.482
God, you think
I'm your enemy, huh?

31:14.516 --> 31:15.950
Well, I'm not.

31:15.984 --> 31:16.951
I didn't even come here

31:16.985 --> 31:19.753
to talk to you about me
or your father.

31:19.788 --> 31:23.558
New York.
Iowa. Kansas.

31:23.592 --> 31:26.060
40 states that all
have housing projects

31:26.094 --> 31:28.228
that will vanish if we don't
find out information

31:28.263 --> 31:29.563
that only you
can help us get.

31:29.597 --> 31:31.465
So you can steal money
for your father's company

31:31.499 --> 31:33.467
or you can blow the whistle
on me if you want to,

31:33.502 --> 31:34.702
but if you
really care about people

31:34.736 --> 31:35.703
the way that you claim to,

31:35.737 --> 31:37.805
you're gonna do this first.

31:42.177 --> 31:44.045
Are we close?

31:44.079 --> 31:46.947
I'm accessing the banks
through a server in China.

31:46.982 --> 31:49.149
Unless you'd rather
me use yours.

31:49.184 --> 31:53.154
- Take your time.
- Done.

31:53.188 --> 31:55.256
All right, there's 16 banks
in Liechtenstein.

31:55.290 --> 31:57.625
This is every account
in every single one of them.

31:57.660 --> 32:00.562
None of the accounts
is listed under Anthony Mazlo.

32:00.596 --> 32:01.563
Forget about the name.

32:01.597 --> 32:03.331
Find an account
with $150 million

32:03.366 --> 32:07.603
embezzled from Stable Shelters
on that day.

32:07.637 --> 32:09.438
Harvey, it's time.

32:09.472 --> 32:11.407
Unless you have something,

32:11.442 --> 32:12.609
I'm calling Lucille to settle.

32:12.643 --> 32:15.445
Jessica,
you know how Liechtenstein

32:15.480 --> 32:16.847
doesn't respond to subpoenas,

32:16.881 --> 32:18.115
so I've responded for them.

32:18.149 --> 32:19.583
Just trust me.

32:19.618 --> 32:22.119
We've got everything we need
to find Lucille's money.

32:22.153 --> 32:25.088
It's not here.

32:25.123 --> 32:27.924
Sounds like you need more
than just another minute.

32:27.959 --> 32:29.626
You need another person.

32:29.660 --> 32:31.861
Someone whose expertise
is financial crime.

32:31.895 --> 32:33.562
No. No.

32:33.597 --> 32:37.132
Harvey, bring in Louis.

32:37.167 --> 32:39.301
Or I'm calling Lucille.

32:49.733 --> 32:52.067
Donna,
I need to talk to Louis.

32:52.102 --> 32:53.469
He's not in his office.

32:53.503 --> 32:55.637
Huh. Norma wouldn't
tell you where he is?

32:55.672 --> 32:58.741
Well, she didn't, um...

32:58.775 --> 33:01.176
You didn't ask her,
did you?

33:01.211 --> 33:02.344
She gives me the creeps.

33:02.379 --> 33:04.113
Ugh.
You're such a wuss.

33:04.147 --> 33:05.247
What did you
just say to me?

33:05.281 --> 33:09.218
I think we both know
what I just said.

33:09.252 --> 33:11.320
Norma, where is he?

33:11.354 --> 33:13.188
What?
You're kidding.

33:13.223 --> 33:15.024
- What?
- Shh.

33:27.736 --> 33:30.505
I come here
when I need to be alone.

33:30.540 --> 33:32.775
.44 Magnum?

33:32.809 --> 33:34.510
Really?

33:34.545 --> 33:36.512
Feeling lucky today, punk?

33:36.547 --> 33:38.314
You know,
I understand

33:38.349 --> 33:40.651
that me pissing the bed
on this case

33:40.685 --> 33:43.354
must be really, really
fun for you.

33:43.388 --> 33:46.590
No.
Louis, it's not.

33:46.625 --> 33:48.092
The one thing
you and I have in common

33:48.127 --> 33:49.961
is we need to win.

33:49.995 --> 33:52.331
I noticed that.

33:52.365 --> 33:55.567
I came here because,
even after everything,

33:55.601 --> 33:56.868
we can win.

33:56.902 --> 33:59.103
No.

33:59.137 --> 34:02.539
I can watch while you win.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.909
Louis, I'm not here
to give you shit.

34:04.943 --> 34:06.744
Listen, I respect you.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.145
I bribed a witness.

34:08.179 --> 34:09.614
You incentivized her.

34:09.648 --> 34:11.181
Went to see Perkins' widow.

34:11.216 --> 34:12.583
To apologize.

34:12.618 --> 34:14.620
I killed a man.

34:14.654 --> 34:16.822
That you thought
had it coming.

34:16.857 --> 34:20.025
I don't think
you heard what I said.

34:20.060 --> 34:21.895
I respect you.

34:25.533 --> 34:27.900
You need my help.

34:27.935 --> 34:30.270
I wouldn't phrase it
exactly like that.

34:30.304 --> 34:32.371
Well,
if you need my help,

34:32.406 --> 34:33.974
you better phrase it
exactly like that.

34:34.007 --> 34:35.141
Okay.
You want me to say it?

34:35.176 --> 34:36.342
I'll say it.

34:36.377 --> 34:38.178
I'm under the gun,
and I need your help.

34:38.212 --> 34:41.614
I've got information that you've
got the financial expertise

34:41.649 --> 34:42.849
to break this case.

34:42.884 --> 34:44.717
Now let's put the gun down
and go get 'em.

34:47.822 --> 34:49.357
Okay.

34:49.391 --> 34:50.891
First just stand over there.

34:50.925 --> 34:52.994
Don't push it.

35:01.703 --> 35:03.203
So what was the exact
amount of money

35:03.238 --> 35:05.005
that was lost from
Stable Shelters' account?

35:05.040 --> 35:06.006
Why?

35:06.041 --> 35:10.344
$152,375,242.18.

35:13.848 --> 35:15.715
I'm good with numbers.

35:15.750 --> 35:17.417
Huh.

35:17.452 --> 35:18.952
All right.
What do you have?

35:18.987 --> 35:21.155
We've compiled a printout
of every account

35:21.189 --> 35:23.525
that had a deposit made
on the day in question

35:23.559 --> 35:25.827
in all of Liechtenstein's
16 banks.

35:25.861 --> 35:31.432
Okay. Well, we are going
to focus on, excuse me...

35:31.466 --> 35:32.600
These five banks.

35:32.634 --> 35:34.768
How can you be sure?

35:34.803 --> 35:36.303
Watch this.

35:36.337 --> 35:37.738
These four banks
have a history

35:37.772 --> 35:39.873
of capitulating to subpoenas.

35:39.908 --> 35:41.241
So Mazlo would know.

35:41.276 --> 35:44.044
These six
have U.S. corporate parents,

35:44.078 --> 35:46.246
which would expose their
accounts to federal scrutiny.

35:46.281 --> 35:48.382
Once again,
Mazlo would know.

35:48.417 --> 35:50.852
And then the one that he's got
right there is low in reserves,

35:50.886 --> 35:52.854
therefore its solvency's
in question,

35:52.888 --> 35:54.255
and there is no way in hell

35:54.290 --> 35:55.857
that Mazlo would take
his stolen money

35:55.891 --> 35:58.960
and put it into
some shaky bank.

35:58.995 --> 36:01.397
So we can be sure.

36:01.431 --> 36:02.732
Every person
who embezzles money,

36:02.766 --> 36:03.966
they do it
in their own way,

36:04.001 --> 36:05.768
but the one thing
that they all have in common

36:05.802 --> 36:08.237
is that they never put
all their eggs in one basket.

36:08.272 --> 36:11.007
So we are going to be looking
at a combination of accounts.

36:11.041 --> 36:12.108
Across banks.

36:12.142 --> 36:13.443
Well, I mean,
maybe across banks.

36:13.477 --> 36:14.910
Maybe the same bank.

36:14.945 --> 36:16.312
But we're definitely looking
at more than one account.

36:16.346 --> 36:17.579
How do we figure out
which accounts are his?

36:17.614 --> 36:18.981
Because they're all
gonna add up

36:19.015 --> 36:20.415
to the same exact
amount of money

36:20.450 --> 36:21.883
that was lost from
Stable Shelters' account.

36:21.918 --> 36:23.218
Well, how do you know?

36:23.252 --> 36:24.953
When the account was drained,
it had to go somewhere.

36:24.987 --> 36:27.822
What goes out from Lucille's
had to go into Mazlo's.

36:27.857 --> 36:29.290
Simple law of mathematics.

36:29.325 --> 36:31.226
So we just have to figure out
a combination of accounts

36:31.261 --> 36:36.066
that adds up to...
$152,375,242.18.

36:36.100 --> 36:38.969
I'm good with numbers too.

36:47.778 --> 36:49.713
Thanks for meeting us
on such short notice.

36:49.747 --> 36:51.548
Well, I assume you're ready
to take our offer.

36:51.582 --> 36:52.582
I rushed right down.

36:52.617 --> 36:53.984
Well, we just have
a few questions

36:54.019 --> 36:55.252
before we get to any of that.

36:55.287 --> 36:56.920
We didn't agree to answer
any questions.

36:56.954 --> 37:00.290
No, no, Robert, it's okay.
I'm happy to play.

37:00.325 --> 37:03.126
Have you ever been
to Liechtenstein, Mr. Mazlo?

37:03.161 --> 37:05.229
You know,
I've been to many places.

37:05.263 --> 37:07.931
Among them,
Liechtenstein.

37:07.966 --> 37:10.133
Really?
Well, of those many places,

37:10.168 --> 37:11.935
did you open seven
different bank accounts,

37:11.970 --> 37:14.305
the amounts of which add up to
exactly the same amount of money

37:14.339 --> 37:16.974
that disappeared from Lucille
Jackson's endowment fund?

37:17.009 --> 37:19.177
I doubt it.
Uh, what I don't doubt

37:19.212 --> 37:21.480
is that if you trace the money
that went into those accounts,

37:21.515 --> 37:22.815
you'll find that it came

37:22.849 --> 37:25.118
from our corporate offices
in Sri Lanka.

37:25.152 --> 37:26.686
It's completely legitimate.

37:26.721 --> 37:28.455
I mean, I'm happy
to show you the records, uh,

37:28.489 --> 37:30.023
whenever you'd like.

37:30.057 --> 37:32.359
That's great.
Isn't that great?

37:32.393 --> 37:34.827
Well, after that,
can you show us the records

37:34.862 --> 37:36.329
of the seven
safety deposit boxes

37:36.363 --> 37:38.331
that you opened at those
same banks the same day?

37:47.442 --> 37:48.542
I don't have
to answer that.

37:48.576 --> 37:49.943
This isn't a deposition.

37:49.977 --> 37:52.646
You're so right.
It's more of a presentation.

37:52.680 --> 37:53.847
We could make it
a deposition.

37:53.881 --> 37:55.249
- Or trial.
- Up to you.

37:55.283 --> 37:57.518
We have pictures of you
entering those banks.

37:57.552 --> 38:01.021
And we have enough
to crack their subpoenas.

38:01.056 --> 38:02.857
Just a matter of time,
Tony.

38:06.862 --> 38:08.262
All right.
What do you want?

38:08.296 --> 38:10.164
What do I wa--?
Well, it's not about me.

38:10.199 --> 38:12.233
It's about Lucille.
She wants your head on a stick

38:12.267 --> 38:14.235
but she'll settle
for her money back.

38:14.269 --> 38:18.505
And your resignation.

38:18.539 --> 38:20.206
We agree right here,

38:20.240 --> 38:22.809
no criminal prosecution?

38:26.380 --> 38:28.214
Done.

38:28.249 --> 38:32.653
If Lucille doesn't
get her money back today,

38:32.687 --> 38:34.555
nothing's done.

38:43.632 --> 38:45.433
Great.
That's perfect.

38:45.467 --> 38:46.767
You are back in business.

38:46.802 --> 38:48.235
The wire transfer
just went through.

38:48.270 --> 38:50.604
Girl, you came through.

38:50.639 --> 38:52.439
That is what we do.

38:52.473 --> 38:54.908
Harvey.
Harvey, get in here.

38:54.943 --> 38:57.344
Lucille wants
to thank you in person.

38:57.378 --> 38:59.646
Always got time
for gratitude.

38:59.681 --> 39:01.482
Harvey,
you didn't let me settle,

39:01.516 --> 39:03.150
and I appreciate
your tenacity.

39:03.184 --> 39:04.785
Truth is,
I didn't do this on my own.

39:04.819 --> 39:05.986
Have you met Louis Litt?

39:06.020 --> 39:07.354
You guys are doing
such good work.

39:07.388 --> 39:08.622
I just want you to know it.

39:08.656 --> 39:10.958
Have I told you how valuable
you are to this company?

39:10.992 --> 39:12.826
'Cause you're not.
I'm just kidding.

39:12.860 --> 39:15.563
Janice, I want you to take
the rest of the day off

39:15.597 --> 39:17.331
because you're so good.
And I really mean it.

39:17.365 --> 39:20.000
Harold, 9:30.
Tequila shots.

39:20.035 --> 39:22.236
You and me. Sharp.
Be there.

39:26.241 --> 39:27.742
Thank you.

39:27.777 --> 39:29.978
- All right.
- See you later.

39:34.317 --> 39:37.686
Louis. Luiz.

39:37.721 --> 39:38.754
What's up?

39:38.789 --> 39:40.690
What were you
just doing in there?

39:40.724 --> 39:41.991
What?
I was just...

39:42.025 --> 39:43.726
Let me guess.
You were cutting me out.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.928
- What are you talking about?
- The little impromptu meeting

39:45.962 --> 39:47.262
you just had
with Jessica and Lucille

39:47.297 --> 39:48.730
that you conveniently
left me out of.

39:48.765 --> 39:50.032
I didn't leave you
out of anything.

39:50.066 --> 39:51.333
I mean,
I thought we were a team.

39:51.367 --> 39:52.701
I thought this was the start
of something, but I--

39:52.736 --> 39:55.004
now I see the truth
all too clearly.

39:55.038 --> 39:58.040
Louis, I was walking by,
and they called me in.

39:58.074 --> 40:00.942
Yeah, just in time to take
the credit for what I did.

40:00.977 --> 40:03.478
I didn't do that.

40:03.512 --> 40:05.513
Wouldn't even think
of doing that.

40:05.547 --> 40:07.415
But you know what?

40:07.450 --> 40:10.485
You would, and that's
your problem right there.

40:28.573 --> 40:30.707
Got your email
about Mazlo.

40:30.741 --> 40:33.643
Not a bad way
for Locksley LLC to go out.

40:33.677 --> 40:35.678
Looks like the
firm owes you one.

40:35.712 --> 40:37.847
Think <i>you</i> owe me one.

40:44.621 --> 40:48.758
Whoa.

40:48.793 --> 40:50.293
- Is this...
- The real thing?

40:50.328 --> 40:51.861
Yeah.

40:51.895 --> 40:54.397
Told the Dean's office
you'd lost yours,

40:54.431 --> 40:55.865
and they were happy
to oblige

40:55.899 --> 40:58.401
for one of
their top graduates.

40:58.435 --> 41:01.737
I don't know if
you're awesome or terrifying.

41:01.772 --> 41:05.074
Also I added a layer
of protection for you.

41:11.513 --> 41:14.315
Uh, the Harvard Law School
Alumni Database?

41:17.119 --> 41:19.719
It's all there.
Your name, class rank,

41:19.754 --> 41:21.755
social security number.

41:21.789 --> 41:24.691
You do realize you just
made me party to a crime, right?

41:24.725 --> 41:26.158
Can always call 'em up,

41:26.193 --> 41:27.693
report it as a glitch.

41:27.728 --> 41:30.930
Let me guess.
Untraceable.

41:30.964 --> 41:32.865
I'm not saying
you won't get caught,

41:32.900 --> 41:36.136
but it won't be because
your story doesn't check.

41:39.339 --> 41:41.908
Hey, um...

41:41.943 --> 41:43.777
Thank you.

41:43.811 --> 41:45.579
Seriously.

41:45.613 --> 41:47.180
You're right.

41:47.215 --> 41:49.416
Working things out
with my dad.

41:49.450 --> 41:51.084
Yeah.

41:51.119 --> 41:53.486
Not the empty suit
I thought you were.

42:01.094 --> 42:02.761
Who was that?

42:02.795 --> 42:04.896
Uh, client's daughter.

42:04.931 --> 42:06.298
Really?
It's kind of late.

42:06.332 --> 42:08.233
What's she doing
at the office at this hour?

42:08.267 --> 42:11.471
You know, she was, uh,
just thanking me.

42:11.505 --> 42:12.839
- Thanking you.
- Mm-hmm.

42:12.873 --> 42:14.941
How'd she do that?

42:14.976 --> 42:17.010
Easily.

42:17.045 --> 42:18.646
She bought me
two plane tickets to Greece.

42:18.680 --> 42:20.381
- Not interested.
- We leave Tuesday.
