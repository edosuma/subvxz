<i>The entire world
is a collection of memoranda</i>

00:39.806 --> 00:43.710
<i>that she did exist,
and that I have lost her.</i>

00:43.743 --> 00:45.947
<i>Whatever our souls
are made of,</i>

00:45.980 --> 00:48.581
<i>hers and mine are the same.</i>

00:48.916 --> 00:51.851
<i>A rather pretentious way
to open our story...</i>

00:51.885 --> 00:54.487
<i>but I've always
had a flair for the dramatic.</i>

00:54.521 --> 00:57.191
<i>You see, this is</i> our <i>story...</i>

00:57.224 --> 00:59.126
<i>Tessa's and mine.</i>

00:59.160 --> 01:00.995
<i>It's a story
you've heard before,</i>

01:01.028 --> 01:03.897
<i>passed down from the Greeks,
through Shakespeare,</i>

01:03.931 --> 01:06.633
<i>the Brontes, Jane Austen.</i>

01:07.068 --> 01:10.670
<i>It's the story of a young girl
exploring her independence,</i>

01:10.704 --> 01:13.640
<i>free from the bonds
of her oppressive parent...</i>

01:13.673 --> 01:17.244
<i>and promised to a boy
she clearly does not love.</i>

01:17.278 --> 01:19.713
<i>She meets a dashingly
handsome young man</i>

01:19.746 --> 01:21.983
<i>who sweeps her off her feet...</i>

01:22.016 --> 01:25.920
<i>even though he represents
everything she detests.</i>

01:25.953 --> 01:27.989
<i>She falls for him,</i>

01:28.022 --> 01:30.191
<i>gives herself to him,</i>

01:30.224 --> 01:32.994
<i>and is ultimately
betrayed by him</i>

01:33.027 --> 01:35.129
<i>and left shattered.</i>

01:35.762 --> 01:39.967
<i>Only it is he who is
destroyed by his deceit.</i>

01:40.434 --> 01:42.903
<i>When it feels as though
all is lost,</i>

01:42.937 --> 01:47.174
<i>the two reunite
and live happily ever after.</i>

01:47.208 --> 01:51.278
<i>Like I've said,
a story you've heard before.</i>

01:51.312 --> 01:53.646
<i>Only difference is...</i>

01:53.880 --> 01:56.017
<i>this isn't that story.</i>

02:44.731 --> 02:47.001
Hey. Can I ask you a question?

02:47.034 --> 02:49.303
- Piss off.
- I'm looking for someone.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.105
Piss off!

03:08.956 --> 03:12.725
Whoo! Sure don't seem
like Christmas out here,

03:12.759 --> 03:14.861
all this heat
we've been havin'.

03:14.894 --> 03:17.298
Ya know, I hate the heat.

03:17.331 --> 03:20.267
Heat make people
do some crazy things.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.702
Hoo!

03:34.148 --> 03:36.250
Thank... Thank you!

03:36.749 --> 03:38.852
Sorry.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.258
Excuse me! Sir, can you
hold that elevator, please!

03:44.291 --> 03:46.393
Asswipe!

03:50.864 --> 03:53.067
Thank you.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.237
Did you call me
an asswipe?

03:56.270 --> 03:58.072
Excuse me?

03:58.105 --> 04:01.008
You just called me
an asswipe.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.110
Um, no. I didn't.

04:03.710 --> 04:06.413
Yeah, I guess
I just imagined it.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.748
Guess so.

04:09.083 --> 04:12.052
Ya know, I <i>was</i> trying
to hold the elevator for you.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.188
Sure you were.

04:16.890 --> 04:19.059
Look, I'm sorry.
It's my first day.

04:19.093 --> 04:21.060
I'm just trying
to make an impression.

04:21.095 --> 04:24.864
Well, you certainly
succeeded at that.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.735
Asswipe.

04:35.209 --> 04:36.377
No, no, no, no...

04:36.410 --> 04:38.145
- You work here?
- Surprise.

04:38.179 --> 04:39.346
Tessa!

04:39.380 --> 04:41.115
Welcome to
Vance Publishing.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.782
Hi. Kimberly, right?

04:42.815 --> 04:44.385
Excellent memory.
I'm impressed.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.053
Yes, she makes
quite the impression.

04:46.086 --> 04:46.987
You two know each other?

04:47.021 --> 04:49.323
Uh... we're old friends.

04:49.356 --> 04:51.791
Now, if you ladies
will excuse me?

04:51.824 --> 04:53.394
- Are you excited to get going?
- Yeah.

04:53.427 --> 04:55.862
Let's introduce you
to the boss.

04:55.895 --> 04:59.133
Shut the fuck up
and listen to me!

04:59.166 --> 05:01.868
This might not be
the best time for introductions.

05:01.902 --> 05:05.105
Why don't I
show you your office?

05:05.139 --> 05:07.041
Trevor!

05:07.074 --> 05:09.176
On it.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.282
I apologize for the mess.

05:15.316 --> 05:16.951
We've been short
on interns lately,

05:16.984 --> 05:18.419
and we're a bit
backlogged.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.087
That seems crazy to me.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.223
People I know would kill
for an internship here.

05:22.256 --> 05:23.790
I know, it's just that Vance

05:23.823 --> 05:25.858
has this small problem with

05:25.892 --> 05:27.261
firing them after a day.

05:27.294 --> 05:28.529
But that's not
going to happen to you.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.497
I have a good feeling
about this.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.967
But like I said
during the interview,

05:33.000 --> 05:34.801
your job is to read
five manuscripts a week,

05:34.834 --> 05:37.137
and if you like them,
just forward them on to me.

05:37.171 --> 05:39.340
- Okay.
- The kitchen is right down the hall.

05:39.373 --> 05:41.508
Feel free to place
any order for lunch.

05:41.542 --> 05:44.011
- Any questions?
- Uh, no. I'm good.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.247
You got this.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.438
Mmm.

06:45.306 --> 06:47.374
Mr. Vance!

06:48.175 --> 06:50.210
Um... Um, I'm so sorry.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.612
I must have dozed off.

06:51.645 --> 06:54.081
- What time is it?
- 9:25.

06:55.949 --> 06:58.052
9:25?

06:58.085 --> 07:00.187
- Am I fired?
- Sit down.

07:00.721 --> 07:03.090
You mean to tell me
you read three books

07:03.123 --> 07:05.259
and did coverage
on all of them last night,

07:05.292 --> 07:09.963
and you think <i>Carnival of Light</i>
by Niko Tanaka is a great read?

07:09.997 --> 07:11.864
Yeah, it is. It's, uh,

07:11.898 --> 07:13.300
she has a really original voice,

07:13.334 --> 07:15.436
it's a lot like
an early Margaret Atwood,

07:15.469 --> 07:17.037
<i>The Edible Woman,</i>

07:17.071 --> 07:20.274
- <i>Surfacing...</i>
- I'm coming down now.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.243
Grab your things.
Come with me.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.379
Oh, shit.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.252
Morning, Mr. Vance.

07:32.286 --> 07:34.355
- Morning, sir.
- Mr. Vance, I was just...

07:34.388 --> 07:36.490
I was wondering if we had time
to go back to...

07:36.523 --> 07:38.058
Get in.

07:38.092 --> 07:40.494
Because I have to get
my phone charger in at...

07:40.527 --> 07:43.230
Oh, we're closing the door!

07:44.698 --> 07:47.101
Little work tip.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.636
- Hmm?
- It helps if you don't wear the same clothes every day.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.271
That, and showering.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.910
Um, where are we going?

07:56.944 --> 07:58.645
There's a digital
publishing conference,

07:58.679 --> 08:00.981
and I need to secure
some funding for my expansion.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.154
Fuck off!

08:08.288 --> 08:11.358
What part of "We're closed"
don't...

08:11.392 --> 08:13.026
- Hi.
- You busy?

08:13.060 --> 08:14.995
Kind of in the middle
of something.

08:15.028 --> 08:19.333
So, you know, why don't you
come back tomorrow?

08:19.366 --> 08:21.668
Or just come in right now.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.041
I'm good.

08:28.075 --> 08:30.911
Come on, it'll ease the pain.

08:31.445 --> 08:33.714
I like the pain.

08:33.746 --> 08:37.985
Well, suit yourself,
you fuckin' masochist.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.459
Welcome back the Montgomery,
Mr. Vance.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.394
I have your rooms
ready for you.

08:47.428 --> 08:50.097
We had a printer delivered
to Mr. Trevor Matthews' room.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.232
Unfortunately, Ms.
Young's room wasn't ready,

08:52.266 --> 08:54.668
so we had her upgraded to a suite
with compliments of the management.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.370
Has Mr. Jiang
checked in yet?

08:56.403 --> 08:58.105
I do believe
he's at the bar.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.339
Of course he is.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.542
So I get a printer
and you get a suite.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.010
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

09:03.043 --> 09:04.678
Definitely.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.513
Hon', do you mind
taking Tessa shopping?

09:06.547 --> 09:07.748
She needs something
for tonight.

09:07.781 --> 09:10.083
I trust you.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.353
Let's go have some fun.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.491
Are you sure
that I can get in?

09:17.524 --> 09:19.526
Because I've never been
to a nightclub before.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.528
But don't they check...?

09:21.562 --> 09:25.199
You'll be with us.
It won't be a problem.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.734
Look, before we go outside,

09:28.101 --> 09:29.736
I just wanted
to tell you something.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.038
Okay.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.173
Vance and I are...

09:34.074 --> 09:36.176
more than co-workers.

09:36.510 --> 09:38.212
Oh.

09:38.245 --> 09:41.281
It was strictly
a work thing for years,

09:41.315 --> 09:43.050
especially after
his wife died,

09:43.083 --> 09:46.019
then I started helping out
with his son Smith,

09:46.053 --> 09:49.456
and, well, love can
really take you by surprise.

09:49.490 --> 09:51.525
Yes, it can.

09:55.229 --> 09:56.730
- That's him?
- Mm-hmm.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.533
- Aw.
- He's the sweetest kid.

10:00.467 --> 10:02.569
Ohh.

10:02.603 --> 10:06.340
Can't wait for them to see you
in this dress tonight.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.475
Oh, shoot.

10:08.910 --> 10:10.444
We forgot
to buy you underwear.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.412
But my clothes
are at the laundry.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.715
If I leave now,
I can run back to the mall...

10:14.748 --> 10:16.350
Oh, no, no, no.
No. It's fine.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.485
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

10:18.987 --> 10:22.489
Okay, I guess
we're goin' commando, then.

10:28.462 --> 10:31.064
I can't believe I've been
at Vance for only a day.

10:31.098 --> 10:34.535
Well, Hardin said we'd
be lucky to have you.

10:34.568 --> 10:38.272
- You spoke to Hardin.
- No, Vance did.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.107
He didn't tell you?

10:40.140 --> 10:42.643
Must have slipped his mind.

11:14.374 --> 11:19.346
Yes, well, as long as we're
at the conference by two...

11:21.916 --> 11:23.750
Wow.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.054
You clean up nicely.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.256
Gee, Trevor, you sure know
how to charm the ladies.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.757
Tessa, you look stunning.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.659
Thank you.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.795
On the move.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.674
So what books
have you written?

11:47.708 --> 11:49.810
Oh, this and that.

11:56.617 --> 11:58.619
Feel like I'm sitting
at the kids' table.

11:58.652 --> 12:00.287
Thanks.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.456
No, that's not what I meant.
Sorry.

12:02.489 --> 12:03.824
I hate nightclubs.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.927
Probably because
I suck at dancing.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.328
I love Ohio football,
but I hate nightclubs.

12:08.362 --> 12:10.464
Why are we here?

12:11.398 --> 12:12.899
Him.

12:12.934 --> 12:14.902
Mr. Jiang.

12:14.936 --> 12:17.504
His family owns
a hedge fund worth 800 million

12:17.537 --> 12:20.942
and it's considering
investing in Vance's expansion.

12:20.975 --> 12:22.309
You want me
to get you a drink?

12:22.342 --> 12:23.777
I'm gonna stick with water.

12:23.810 --> 12:25.879
All my budget
really allows these days.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.915
I thought you were
a paid intern.

12:27.949 --> 12:30.884
You'd be surprised how much
Uber charges can add up.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.320
I mean, I'd be lucky
to break even.

12:36.390 --> 12:38.592
- I'll go.
- What it is?

12:40.995 --> 12:43.296
Sex on the Beach.

12:43.998 --> 12:45.465
Quite a beach.

12:47.868 --> 12:51.571
Grab a straw.
On your mark, get set, go.

12:57.811 --> 13:00.213
It's really good.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.482
Mr. Jiang, have you had a chance
to look at my numbers yet?

13:02.516 --> 13:04.384
With the forecast of
rising interest rates...

13:05.452 --> 13:06.787
Again. Just...

13:06.820 --> 13:08.923
Yeah.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.428
We're gonna
get fucked up tonight!

13:31.878 --> 13:34.715
Well, well, look what
the cat dragged in.

13:34.748 --> 13:36.650
That's a stupid
fucking expression.

13:36.683 --> 13:38.885
Why would a cat
drag me anywhere?

13:38.920 --> 13:41.221
Welcome back, bro.

13:44.691 --> 13:46.793
Did you miss us?

13:55.169 --> 13:57.504
Wait.
I don't get it.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.639
Of course you don't.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.642
This is great!

14:05.679 --> 14:08.515
I feel like dancing!

14:17.524 --> 14:19.060
Guess who.

14:19.093 --> 14:20.627
Okay, I'll give you a hint.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.930
She's super fuckin' hot,
a lot of fun,

14:22.964 --> 14:24.898
and <i>loves</i> to fuck.

14:24.932 --> 14:27.400
- Mother Teresa.
- No. Ew.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.971
Ta-da!

14:30.004 --> 14:33.040
I know, I look amazing.
I've had, like, no carbs in eight weeks,

14:33.074 --> 14:35.042
- but I'm feeling fucking fantastic.
- Wow.

14:35.076 --> 14:36.978
Yeah, its from the lack of
carbs and not all the blow.

14:37.011 --> 14:38.445
Don't you have some carpets
to munch on?

14:38.478 --> 14:39.679
Don't you have
some dick to suck?

15:42.977 --> 15:46.413
What do I have to do
to make you forgive me?

15:46.446 --> 15:49.416
- I know I've been really bad.
- Worse than bad.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.086
Yeah, but you like it
when I'm bad.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.421
You know you miss me.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.594
Now get the fuck off me.

16:01.895 --> 16:03.030
Whoa!

16:03.064 --> 16:05.465
What the fuck, Hardin?!

16:05.967 --> 16:08.069
Hardin, you didn't mind fucking me
before, though, right?

16:08.102 --> 16:10.403
Oh, let me guess.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.940
You're still moping
over that stuck-up bitch.

16:12.974 --> 16:14.608
Don't fuckin' talk about her,
okay?!

16:14.641 --> 16:17.444
Look at you. You look
like a lost little puppy

16:17.477 --> 16:19.146
over some
Virgin Mary-turned-skank

16:19.180 --> 16:23.150
who doesn't even want you!

16:23.184 --> 16:25.485
Ohhh, God.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.122
What the fuck you looking at,
freshman?

16:28.155 --> 16:33.027
You want me to steal your boyfriend?
So turn the fuck around.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.162
I look hot.

16:45.872 --> 16:46.908
Tessa?

16:46.941 --> 16:48.675
Hi! I just, uh,

16:48.708 --> 16:50.077
I just wanted to inform you

16:50.111 --> 16:52.179
that I look hot,

16:52.213 --> 16:53.747
and you're missing it.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.849
Tessa, where are you?

16:55.882 --> 16:57.751
Whoo! Somewhere
that you're not.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.587
Tess, I have your location,
I can find you.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.124
How much have you had to drink?

17:03.157 --> 17:05.159
I don't know, like five?

17:05.192 --> 17:06.193
Five what?

17:06.227 --> 17:08.560
Uh, Sex on the Beaches.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.965
Or is it Sexes on the Beaches?

17:12.598 --> 17:14.902
That coulda been fun!

17:14.935 --> 17:16.670
You are wasted.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.973
Oh, hey, Hardin?
I'm the commander.

17:19.006 --> 17:21.242
<i>I've been the commander
all night.</i>

17:21.275 --> 17:22.944
Command...

17:22.977 --> 17:24.577
<i>What's it called?</i>

17:24.611 --> 17:27.513
I'm not wearing
any underwear!

17:27.547 --> 17:29.649
- <i>Aaah! Ha ha ha!</i>
- Tess, who are you with?

17:29.683 --> 17:31.651
Why haven't you called me?

17:31.685 --> 17:32.987
I've texted you
a hundred times!

17:33.020 --> 17:34.188
You haven't replied!

17:34.221 --> 17:36.090
I actually have to go,

17:36.123 --> 17:38.725
but it was nice talking to
you, Mr. Hardin Scott,

17:38.758 --> 17:40.094
so goodbye.

17:40.127 --> 17:43.463
Don't fu... Te...

17:43.965 --> 17:45.199
Tessa.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.234
Trevor!

17:47.268 --> 17:49.971
I'm drunk, uncomfortable,
and I saw a tampon on the ground.

17:50.004 --> 17:51.671
- I'm leaving.
- Yeah, no, me too.

17:51.705 --> 17:53.174
Can we order room service?

17:53.207 --> 17:55.542
I... I want French fries

17:56.210 --> 17:58.545
and... ice cream.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.680
Dow!

18:02.882 --> 18:05.685
Nothin' like a vanilla sundae
at three in the morning.

18:05.719 --> 18:07.955
Yeah,
it sounded better in the moment.

18:10.124 --> 18:12.525
- So... Tessa.
- Hmm.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.261
- Tessa Young.
- Mm-hmm.

18:14.295 --> 18:16.563
Why the hell
are you in publishing?

18:16.596 --> 18:18.732
Well, I love to read...

18:19.967 --> 18:22.069
That makes sense.

18:22.403 --> 18:24.704
What's your favorite book?

18:24.738 --> 18:28.842
It's <i>The Principles of
Economics</i> by Alfred Marshall.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.810
- No, it's not.
- Yeah, it is.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.947
No, I mean...
I mean, like, fiction.

18:32.980 --> 18:34.949
Like... Like a real book.

18:34.982 --> 18:36.951
I don't do fiction.

18:36.984 --> 18:38.752
I mean, have you seen
how I dress?

18:38.785 --> 18:40.287
- You heathen!
- Heathen?

18:40.321 --> 18:42.056
You heathen!

18:42.089 --> 18:44.325
Fiction's an escape
from reality,

18:44.358 --> 18:46.293
it's a way that, like,
you can live a hundred lives,

18:46.327 --> 18:47.861
or even a thousand.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.629
I don't need to live
a thousand lives.

18:49.662 --> 18:53.533
Okay? And I would rather
watch paint dry.

18:54.335 --> 18:57.204
I, um, that wasn't...

18:57.238 --> 18:59.672
No, I... that wasn't
supposed to happen.

19:12.886 --> 19:14.821
Look, I'm telling you,
I know what I'm doing.

19:14.854 --> 19:18.625
We just have to soak it
before it stains.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.228
Can I have your pants?

19:21.262 --> 19:23.197
- Tessa...
- Gimme your pants!

19:23.230 --> 19:26.000
Otherwise it's gonna stain.

19:33.174 --> 19:35.608
<i>Tessa!</i>

19:35.642 --> 19:37.278
- <i>Tessa, open the door.</i>
- Is that Hardin Scott?

19:37.311 --> 19:40.014
<i>Open the door!</i>

19:43.284 --> 19:45.119
Hi.

19:45.152 --> 19:48.822
Are you trying to get me
kicked out of this place?

19:48.855 --> 19:51.691
Yeah,
come on in, why don't you?

19:51.724 --> 19:53.827
Hey...

19:55.396 --> 19:57.031
Hey, Hardin, didn't see ya.
How ya been?

19:57.064 --> 19:59.732
- Fucking Trevor?!
- Time to go, I think.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.135
- I'm just gonna...
- No, you're not.

20:01.168 --> 20:03.137
- I just wanna talk to him!
- No! No...

20:03.170 --> 20:05.039
- Tessa... Tessa...
- Stop!

20:05.072 --> 20:07.640
- Hardin, I think this is a mis...
- Fuck off.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.809
You're such a dick.
Why are you even here?

20:09.843 --> 20:11.378
<i>I'm</i> a dick?

20:11.412 --> 20:13.746
I'm not the one taking
advantage of drunk girls.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.715
You... You do know
that not every guy

20:15.748 --> 20:18.052
is trying to get
in my pants, right?

20:18.085 --> 20:20.287
- You'd be surprised.
- You can't tell me

20:20.321 --> 20:22.957
who I can and can't have sex with,
because it's none of your business anymore!

20:22.990 --> 20:25.658
- Were you going to have sex with him?
- Oh, my God!

20:25.692 --> 20:26.961
- What?
- You're insane!

20:26.994 --> 20:29.964
You're avoiding the question.

20:35.869 --> 20:37.271
What if I was?

20:37.304 --> 20:39.406
What?

20:40.874 --> 20:42.977
You heard me.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.046
What if I was?

20:46.080 --> 20:48.282
What,
you don't like that?

20:48.315 --> 20:51.252
You don't like the idea
of Trevor's hands...

20:51.285 --> 20:53.354
all over my body?

20:54.088 --> 20:56.190
Touching me?

21:00.793 --> 21:02.862
I've missed this.

21:02.896 --> 21:06.200
- Tessa, you're drunk.
- Mm-hmm. So?

21:07.368 --> 21:09.736
Tess...

21:09.769 --> 21:11.071
Hmm!

21:11.105 --> 21:12.306
You don't want this?

21:12.339 --> 21:15.109
Of course I want this,
but I...

21:15.409 --> 21:18.979
Hardin... you have
two options here.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.715
Either you fuck me,

21:22.749 --> 21:24.952
or you leave.

21:24.985 --> 21:27.054
You decide.

21:53.080 --> 21:55.182
Ohh.

22:00.421 --> 22:03.290
- Do you have a condom?
- Are you sure?

22:03.324 --> 22:05.326
- Why not.
- You'll hate me tomorrow.

22:05.359 --> 22:08.329
Yeah, well,
I hate you already.

22:22.943 --> 22:24.811
Tell me I'm the only one.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.879
You're the only one.

22:49.169 --> 22:51.272
Mmm.

23:07.021 --> 23:08.289
- Hi!
- <i>Morning!</i>

23:08.322 --> 23:10.057
- Kimberly!
- <i>You up?</i>

23:10.090 --> 23:11.558
Yeah... no, yeah,
I've been up for a while.

23:11.592 --> 23:13.327
- <i>See you down in five.</i>
- Five minutes?

23:13.360 --> 23:15.262
- <i>Problem?</i>
- Nope, not a problem.

23:15.296 --> 23:17.231
- <i>Meet you in the lobby.</i>
- Okay, I'll be right down.

23:17.264 --> 23:19.967
- <i>Don't be late.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

23:21.035 --> 23:23.137
Shit!

23:27.007 --> 23:29.143
Where are my clothes?!

23:34.348 --> 23:36.450
Ohh!

23:38.385 --> 23:40.120
Tessa!

23:40.154 --> 23:42.256
Come back to bed.

23:43.424 --> 23:45.326
Tessa!

23:45.359 --> 23:47.860
What?!
What do you want?!

23:48.295 --> 23:51.265
The other Tessa.
The one who's nice?

23:51.298 --> 23:54.335
Yeah, well,
she's late for work.

23:58.539 --> 24:00.307
- Where are my...
- Why are you so...

24:00.341 --> 24:02.443
Hey! Privacy!

24:02.842 --> 24:05.379
Privacy.
After what we did last night,

24:05.412 --> 24:06.547
you want privacy?

24:06.580 --> 24:07.915
Don't remind me.

24:07.948 --> 24:09.650
Hey,
you called <i>me.</i>

24:09.683 --> 24:11.985
I didn't tell you
to come here.

24:12.019 --> 24:14.054
Okay, I'm starting
to get the feeling

24:14.088 --> 24:16.156
you're not entirely cool
with what happened last night.

24:16.190 --> 24:17.491
No, I'm not cool with it.

24:17.524 --> 24:19.126
Well, do you want
to talk about it?

24:19.159 --> 24:21.228
Nope. You hurt me
and I can't forgive you.

24:21.261 --> 24:22.930
- That's it.
- So last night meant nothing.

24:22.963 --> 24:24.264
I was drunk.

24:24.298 --> 24:27.167
I called you,
you came here...

24:28.135 --> 24:29.269
I made a mistake.

24:29.303 --> 24:30.971
But you obviously missed me.

24:31.004 --> 24:33.006
I didn't know
what I was doing.

24:33.040 --> 24:34.541
- From kissing that guy, to...
- What?

24:34.575 --> 24:36.377
- What?
- From kissing?

24:36.410 --> 24:38.178
- What did you say?
- I didn't say anything.

24:38.212 --> 24:39.913
- You said "kissing that guy."
- No.

24:39.947 --> 24:41.582
- What?! T...
- I need to go.

24:41.615 --> 24:43.584
Tessa, wait. Tessa!

24:43.617 --> 24:46.353
Tessa!

24:47.221 --> 24:49.323
Put your clothes on!

24:50.424 --> 24:52.593
- Who did you kiss?
- No one!

24:52.626 --> 24:53.994
- Was it Trevor?
- No!

24:54.027 --> 24:55.362
My Tessa would never

24:55.396 --> 24:56.930
kiss a fuckin' stranger
at a club.

24:56.964 --> 24:59.099
There is no "your Tessa"
anymore!

24:59.133 --> 25:05.105
Yeah, well, when you were kissing that
guy, I was fucking Molly.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.977
Fuck you!

25:14.548 --> 25:16.650
Fuck!

25:21.655 --> 25:23.957
- Oh!
- Sorry.

25:25.459 --> 25:27.561
Hi.

25:27.928 --> 25:30.097
- Hi.
- Got us some lattes.

25:30.130 --> 25:31.598
Thank you.

25:34.034 --> 25:36.003
Oh. Thank you.

25:36.036 --> 25:38.405
So, interesting night.

25:38.439 --> 25:42.342
Trevor, I'm... so sorry
about last night.

25:42.376 --> 25:44.978
No, don't be. If I showed up
to my girlfriend's hotel room

25:45.012 --> 25:47.714
and I saw a half-naked,
incredibly handsome man there,

25:47.748 --> 25:49.116
I'd react the same way.

25:49.149 --> 25:51.084
Is he still
lurking around?

25:51.118 --> 25:53.253
Should I be hiding
in the van?

25:53.287 --> 25:54.988
He's the one that
should be hiding,

25:55.022 --> 25:57.257
and we are not together.

25:59.059 --> 26:01.495
How do you two
know each other?

26:01.528 --> 26:04.698
- Hardin worked at Vance last year.
- He did?

26:04.731 --> 26:07.234
Yeah. Same position as you,
actually.

26:07.267 --> 26:08.735
Kind of a sad story.

26:08.769 --> 26:11.672
We were best of friends,
and...

26:11.705 --> 26:13.507
then we became lovers,

26:13.540 --> 26:16.677
and then I found
a red hair on my pillow.

26:16.710 --> 26:19.012
Hilarious.

26:19.246 --> 26:20.747
Ya know, I didn't peg you
as the bad boy type.

26:20.781 --> 26:24.117
We'll save that
for another time.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.787
My hero. Ohh.

26:26.820 --> 26:29.089
Anyone else
feel like death?

26:29.122 --> 26:32.025
I don't know what you two said
or did to Neil last night,

26:32.059 --> 26:34.761
but he just wrote a humongous
check to finance our expansion.

26:34.795 --> 26:37.097
Good job.

26:49.443 --> 26:51.111
What are you doing here?

26:51.144 --> 26:53.146
I need some advice.

26:53.180 --> 26:54.615
Advice?

26:54.648 --> 26:56.483
You want advice
from me?

26:56.517 --> 26:58.285
Yeah.

26:58.318 --> 26:59.753
I'm that desperate.

26:59.786 --> 27:02.055
Oh, insults. Great.

27:02.089 --> 27:04.224
I thought you were
an imposter for a second.

27:04.258 --> 27:06.793
- Look, bro, I know I-
- No, step-bro.

27:06.827 --> 27:09.763
I'm not your brother.
You made that very clear.

27:09.796 --> 27:12.266
And if I was Tessa,
I'd never speak to you again, Hardin.

27:12.299 --> 27:15.202
- It's unforgiveable.
- You think I don't know that?!

27:15.235 --> 27:17.204
I know I fucked up!
I know!

27:17.237 --> 27:20.307
She won't return my calls
or texts.

27:20.340 --> 27:22.476
I found out
she kissed some guy.

27:22.509 --> 27:25.112
And... And I told her
I fucked Molly.

27:25.145 --> 27:27.414
- You slept with Molly?
- No, I <i>said</i> I did.

27:27.447 --> 27:29.116
That's the point.
I didn't.

27:29.149 --> 27:30.617
I said it to
get back at her,

27:30.651 --> 27:33.186
and I-I realized
how stupid that was.

27:33.220 --> 27:35.255
- Yeah.
- Oh, fuck this!

27:35.289 --> 27:38.792
So you're just gonna run away like
you do from everything. Right?

27:38.825 --> 27:41.228
- Where you goin'?
- London.

27:41.261 --> 27:43.430
I was going to
take her with me.

27:43.463 --> 27:45.265
I'll see you next year.

27:45.299 --> 27:48.302
Hardin, do you really love her?

27:48.335 --> 27:50.437
No bullshit.

27:51.471 --> 27:52.806
Yes.

27:52.839 --> 27:54.575
Of course
I fucking love her.

27:54.608 --> 27:57.844
I've never felt this way
about anyone before!

27:57.878 --> 28:01.648
Just wish I didn't
fuck the whole thing up.

28:37.919 --> 28:40.220
Focus.

28:41.688 --> 28:43.190
Knock knock.

28:43.223 --> 28:44.858
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:44.891 --> 28:47.194
You're probably goin'
out of town for break,

28:47.227 --> 28:49.763
so just wanna say happy
holidays, and a happy birthday.

28:49.796 --> 28:52.566
- It's your birthday, right?
- Tomorrow.

28:52.599 --> 28:54.701
I made you something.

28:57.237 --> 28:58.872
What's... What's this?

28:58.906 --> 29:02.376
It is a
cost analysis breakdown

29:02.409 --> 29:04.211
of your weekly Uber
expenditure

29:04.244 --> 29:06.546
versus owning a used car.

29:07.214 --> 29:09.182
Okay...

29:09.216 --> 29:12.552
I know. It's just,
turns out you're wasting a lot of money.

29:12.586 --> 29:16.356
I did a little research,
and I found a 2013 Toyota Corolla,

29:16.390 --> 29:18.358
in town,
in excellent condition.

29:18.392 --> 29:21.294
I went down to the dealership,
negotiated terms,

29:21.328 --> 29:24.798
and you'd put no money down,
you only pay 150 bucks a month.

29:24.831 --> 29:27.734
Vance also agreed to put your
auto insurance on company policy,

29:27.768 --> 29:29.369
so that's free.

29:29.403 --> 29:31.238
This is, of course,
if you want to do it.

29:31.271 --> 29:32.272
I just like
crunching numbers...

29:32.305 --> 29:33.640
Oh, my God!

29:33.674 --> 29:35.676
- I take it you...
- Oh, my God! Mwah!

29:35.709 --> 29:37.811
Thank you.

29:40.614 --> 29:42.482
Bye, Tessa.

29:47.487 --> 29:49.924
So, what do you think?

29:49.957 --> 29:51.993
Well, you know,

29:52.026 --> 29:53.660
it's, uh...

29:53.694 --> 29:55.462
it's very Tessa.

29:55.495 --> 29:57.431
I will take that
as a compliment.

29:57.464 --> 29:59.566
I'm right up there.

30:02.803 --> 30:04.738
How's Dakota?

30:04.771 --> 30:07.741
Um, I'm actually looking
at your birthday horoscope.

30:07.774 --> 30:11.678
So first off,
you share a birthday with...

30:11.712 --> 30:14.214
- Joseph Stalin.
- Great.

30:14.881 --> 30:18.518
- You are a proud, idealistic person...
- Like Stalin.

30:18.552 --> 30:21.688
You are more emotional
than is obvious.

30:21.722 --> 30:25.659
You may solidify
a romantic relationship

30:25.692 --> 30:29.896
or become involved
with a mature partner.

30:29.931 --> 30:32.033
Mature.
That doesn't really sound...

30:32.066 --> 30:34.468
No, it doesn't.

30:34.501 --> 30:35.903
He left for London.

30:35.937 --> 30:38.371
Have you heard from him?

30:38.772 --> 30:40.942
I haven't,
because I blocked him.

30:40.975 --> 30:43.276
That'll work.

30:45.012 --> 30:47.314
Bye.

31:24.018 --> 31:27.721
<i>Whose place is this?</i>

32:46.766 --> 32:48.903
<i>"You can draw me to fire,</i>

32:48.936 --> 32:50.871
<i>"you can draw me to water.</i>

32:50.905 --> 32:53.440
<i>"You can draw me
to the gallows,</i>

32:53.473 --> 32:56.043
<i>you can draw me
to any death."</i>

33:29.643 --> 33:32.512
Well, here we are.
I could run you a bath

33:32.545 --> 33:34.015
if you'd like to get
more comfortable.

33:34.048 --> 33:35.882
I would love that.

33:35.917 --> 33:40.887
I remember when you and I
used to take baths together.

33:42.256 --> 33:44.191
Oh, my goodness! Tessa?

33:44.225 --> 33:46.493
- Tessa.
- Hardin's mother.

33:46.526 --> 33:47.861
Hardin said you were
gonna be out of town,

33:47.894 --> 33:49.763
I didn't think
I was gonna meet you!

33:49.796 --> 33:51.464
- Yeah.
- My God,

33:51.498 --> 33:53.234
I cannot believe
how pretty you are.

33:53.267 --> 33:55.102
I mean, Hardin said you were the
most beautiful girl in the world,

33:55.136 --> 33:58.239
but honestly, I thought you were
gonna be covered in tattoos,

33:58.272 --> 34:00.207
green hair,
and a piercing on your bean.

34:00.241 --> 34:01.775
- What bean?
- Mum.

34:01.808 --> 34:03.244
Don't be so melodramatic,
Hardin.

34:03.277 --> 34:04.979
You and I are gonna
be the best of friends.

34:05.012 --> 34:06.579
Do you mind
if I use the loo?

34:06.613 --> 34:08.149
Yeah, of course.
It's just, um...

34:08.181 --> 34:10.483
Oh, look at you!

34:11.918 --> 34:14.188
- Why are you here?
- I came to get the rest of my stuff.

34:14.221 --> 34:15.989
- You were supposed to be in London.
- I know.

34:16.023 --> 34:17.757
I didn't want to go without
you, so she came here.

34:17.791 --> 34:19.726
Why didn't you tell her
that we broke up?

34:19.759 --> 34:21.761
She was so excited
when I told her first,

34:21.795 --> 34:23.230
- I couldn't ruin it for her.
- Hardin!

34:23.264 --> 34:24.931
She's my mum!
I couldn't tell her

34:24.966 --> 34:27.034
about the stupid bet, okay?
I'm sorry.

34:27.068 --> 34:31.571
I don't expect you
to pretend we're still together.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.940
- It's fine.
- What's fine?

34:33.975 --> 34:37.110
I said it's fine.
I'll play along.

34:37.143 --> 34:39.280
Thank you, Tessa.
Thank you so much.

34:39.313 --> 34:41.047
Thanks for the Kindle.

34:41.081 --> 34:43.217
Fuck! Happy birthday!

34:43.483 --> 34:45.752
- Is it your birthday?
- Yeah, it is.

34:45.784 --> 34:47.654
Why are we not
celebrating?

34:47.687 --> 34:50.657
'Cause I... I was just about
to head out of town.

34:50.690 --> 34:53.060
- No!
- Yeah, I'm gonna see my mom.

34:53.094 --> 34:57.764
Can I be selfish and ask
you to stay another night?

34:58.232 --> 35:01.168
Well, my mom's
sort of expec...

35:01.202 --> 35:04.571
We don't know when we're
gonna see each other again.

35:04.604 --> 35:07.607
Yeah. I, uh, I...
I guess I can leave tomorrow.

35:07.640 --> 35:09.743
Brilliant, brilliant,
brilliant.

35:09.776 --> 35:13.713
I am gonna whip you up a homemade birthday
cake that is gonna blow your mind.

35:13.747 --> 35:15.082
Cool.

35:15.116 --> 35:16.683
Cool.

35:23.090 --> 35:25.026
I know I'm biased
'cause I'm his mum,

35:25.059 --> 35:27.928
but isn't that just the cutest
little bum you've ever seen?

35:27.962 --> 35:29.696
Oh, my God, Mum, please.

35:29.729 --> 35:31.631
- Hush.
- It's a pretty cute bum,

35:31.664 --> 35:33.633
Hardin.

35:33.666 --> 35:34.935
Right. Well, uh,

35:34.969 --> 35:36.736
you guys are obviously
having lots of fun,

35:36.770 --> 35:39.073
so I'm just
gonna clear up,

35:39.106 --> 35:42.209
and then...
set myself on fire.

35:42.243 --> 35:44.844
So Hardin tells me you're
an English major as well.

35:44.878 --> 35:48.349
Mm-hmm. I'm in the process
of switching from econ.

35:48.382 --> 35:52.719
I actually just got an
internship at Vance Publishing.

35:52.752 --> 35:54.854
Vance, as in...
Christian Vance?

35:54.888 --> 35:56.991
Mm-hmm.

35:58.092 --> 36:00.995
Hardin and I stayed with
Vance for a few years

36:01.028 --> 36:02.729
when Ken and I broke up.

36:02.762 --> 36:04.864
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:05.565 --> 36:07.234
Hardin never
mentioned that.

36:07.268 --> 36:08.768
Never mentioned what?

36:08.802 --> 36:11.305
Nothing, darling.
Just girl talk.

36:40.034 --> 36:43.204
I'm just gonna grab a blanket
and sleep on the floor.

36:43.237 --> 36:47.374
You don't think we could
share the bed and not...

36:47.408 --> 36:49.809
- You know.
- Do you?

36:49.843 --> 36:51.711
Well, I'd <i>like</i> to think

36:51.744 --> 36:55.049
that we're not
total Neanderthals.

36:55.682 --> 36:57.784
Okay.

37:03.958 --> 37:05.825
G'night.

37:05.859 --> 37:07.962
Good night.

37:16.303 --> 37:18.405
Um...

37:19.073 --> 37:22.775
I'm gonna leave
early in the morning

37:23.177 --> 37:25.312
to... to head out of town.

37:29.782 --> 37:31.885
Okay.

37:33.053 --> 37:36.023
Thank you
for staying tonight.

37:37.191 --> 37:39.326
Thanks for having me.

37:46.066 --> 37:47.401
Sorry.

37:47.434 --> 37:50.137
No. No, it's...
That's okay.

38:05.986 --> 38:08.055
That feels nice.

38:08.989 --> 38:11.091
- Does it?
- Mm-hmm.

38:27.241 --> 38:30.244
- Did you have a nice birthday?
- Yeah, I did.

38:30.277 --> 38:33.981
And thank you again
for the... gift,

38:34.014 --> 38:35.382
it was really thoughtful.

38:35.416 --> 38:38.252
I found it when I was
getting my stuff.

38:38.285 --> 38:40.354
I'm glad you like it.

38:41.222 --> 38:43.924
I love it.

38:52.666 --> 38:54.969
I got a car.

38:55.369 --> 38:57.804
- You got a car?
- Mm-hmm.

38:58.439 --> 39:00.740
What car did you get?

39:04.311 --> 39:06.413
A white one.

39:08.415 --> 39:10.750
Well, happy birthday.

39:13.220 --> 39:15.322
Night.

39:19.293 --> 39:21.395
Good night.

39:25.466 --> 39:28.068
- Good night.
- Good night.

39:29.970 --> 39:32.072
Good night.

39:43.484 --> 39:45.785
- Hardin.
- Huh?

39:46.186 --> 39:48.289
This isn't working.

39:49.556 --> 39:51.858
Why? What's wrong?

39:53.127 --> 39:55.229
Feel.

39:59.166 --> 40:01.268
Oh.

40:04.905 --> 40:07.007
You?

40:11.245 --> 40:13.347
Oh.

40:32.166 --> 40:34.401
Hardin, we should stop.

40:35.169 --> 40:37.271
Okay.

40:37.504 --> 40:38.639
Three seconds
and we'll stop.

40:38.672 --> 40:40.974
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

40:42.976 --> 40:45.245
- Three...
- Three...

40:45.279 --> 40:47.348
- two...
- two...

40:48.082 --> 40:50.150
- one.
- one.

40:57.624 --> 41:00.060
- Okay, ten more seconds.
- Okay.

41:00.094 --> 41:01.929
- And then we'll stop.
- Okay.

41:01.962 --> 41:04.064
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:08.335 --> 41:11.905
Will you apologize to your mum
for us kidnapping you last night?

41:11.939 --> 41:14.007
I will.

41:15.209 --> 41:19.113
I can't tell you how much it means
to me to see Hardin this way.

41:19.146 --> 41:21.281
What way?

41:21.315 --> 41:23.417
Happy.

41:25.586 --> 41:26.920
What?

41:29.423 --> 41:31.525
- Bye.
- Bye.

41:58.285 --> 42:00.387
Nice wheels!

42:00.754 --> 42:03.290
- Vroom vroom!
- Noah, hi!

42:03.323 --> 42:04.625
- Hi!
- It's good to see you!

42:04.658 --> 42:06.093
Good to see you too.

42:06.126 --> 42:07.428
Mmm.

42:07.461 --> 42:09.563
Okay...

42:10.230 --> 42:13.233
Your mom told me that you were comin' home
today, so I figured I'd come greet you.

42:13.267 --> 42:15.202
Did she have you
on speed dial

42:15.235 --> 42:17.070
the second I crossed
the county line?

42:17.104 --> 42:18.472
I mean,
can you blame her?

42:18.505 --> 42:20.340
She knows a good thing
when she sees it.

42:20.374 --> 42:21.975
- Right.
- Right.

42:22.009 --> 42:23.677
Um, how's senior year?

42:23.710 --> 42:26.380
You know me,
breakin' hearts and takin' names.

42:26.413 --> 42:29.016
- That's you.
- Yeah? Yeah.

42:29.316 --> 42:31.485
Your mom told me
about the internship.

42:31.518 --> 42:33.754
- That's really awesome.
- Thanks. Yeah.

42:33.787 --> 42:36.256
And everything's cool with
the whole thing with your dad.

42:36.290 --> 42:38.192
- What whole thing with my dad?
- What?

42:38.225 --> 42:39.726
N-Nothing. Nothing.

42:39.760 --> 42:42.663
- What do you mean, nothing?
- I-I don't know.

42:42.696 --> 42:45.399
- I thought that she would have...
- Thought she what?

42:45.432 --> 42:48.135
Uh...

42:48.769 --> 42:50.604
Are you kidding?

42:50.637 --> 42:53.240
- Why is she calling you?
- I'm sorry, Tess.

42:53.273 --> 42:55.075
<i>Sorry,
I got stuck at work.</i>

42:55.108 --> 42:56.643
- Is she there yet?
- Mom?

42:56.677 --> 42:58.779
- Carol, she knows!
- Knows what?!

42:58.812 --> 43:00.447
Oh! Tessa's with you.

43:00.481 --> 43:02.015
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything.

43:02.049 --> 43:03.317
What is going on with Dad?!

43:03.350 --> 43:05.419
Okay, that was rude.

43:06.320 --> 43:07.788
I'm just asking you about Dad.

43:07.821 --> 43:09.289
<i>Fine.</i>

43:09.323 --> 43:10.757
Your father wanted to see you,

43:10.791 --> 43:13.093
but I chased him off.

43:13.126 --> 43:15.028
Why are you getting
so worked up about this?

43:15.062 --> 43:16.763
I'm not getting worked up!

43:16.797 --> 43:18.799
I just don't understand why
you'd keep that a secret.

43:18.832 --> 43:22.469
And you never kept
any secrets from me?

43:22.503 --> 43:25.606
<i>Because I can think of
a big one, and so can Noah.</i>

43:25.639 --> 43:27.641
I thought we got past
this little hiccup

43:27.674 --> 43:29.610
once you got your heart broken.

43:29.643 --> 43:31.512
<i>But I can tell by
the sound of your voice</i>

43:31.545 --> 43:33.280
<i>that this not the case.</i>

43:33.313 --> 43:35.616
This boy is not good for you,
Teresa.

43:35.649 --> 43:38.385
- <i>He is just like your father.</i>
- I'm hanging up.

43:38.418 --> 43:41.522
- <i>No! Don't you fucking hang up on me!</i>
- This was a mistake.

43:41.555 --> 43:43.657
<i>Theresa? Theresa?</i>

43:44.424 --> 43:46.293
I blew it.

43:46.326 --> 43:48.095
I blew it, Carol.
I don't know what happened.

44:17.724 --> 44:19.693
Mummy?

44:29.803 --> 44:31.138
No!

44:31.171 --> 44:32.306
Mummy?

44:32.339 --> 44:35.342
Hardin, get back upstairs now!

44:37.144 --> 44:38.645
Hey. Hey, I'm right here.

44:38.679 --> 44:40.781
Hey. Hey.

44:42.516 --> 44:44.384
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

44:45.652 --> 44:48.088
It was just a nightmare.

45:00.300 --> 45:01.602
Morning.

45:01.635 --> 45:04.738
There... um, there's tea.
I... Help yourself.

45:04.771 --> 45:06.873
Thanks.

45:07.708 --> 45:09.576
Is he okay?

45:09.610 --> 45:11.845
- Hmm?
- The nightmares.

45:12.080 --> 45:14.381
I heard him last night.

45:14.414 --> 45:16.516
Um, he's sleeping now.

45:18.752 --> 45:21.788
How long have they
been going on?

45:23.223 --> 45:25.726
Uh, ever since he was eight.

45:27.427 --> 45:29.529
Um, he, uh, well...

45:30.897 --> 45:33.367
He told me...

45:33.400 --> 45:35.302
about that night
and what he saw.

45:35.335 --> 45:37.437
The assault.

45:38.072 --> 45:41.842
Whoa. He's never
told anyone that before.

45:43.810 --> 45:46.513
I'm so sorry for
what happened to you.

45:46.546 --> 45:50.417
I just hoped he'd forget
the whole thing.

45:52.920 --> 45:56.857
But the nightmares kicked in.

45:56.890 --> 45:59.359
Sorry.

45:59.393 --> 46:01.662
And I took him to therapist
after therapist,

46:01.695 --> 46:03.864
but nothing
seemed to help.

46:03.897 --> 46:08.368
And then he started
self-medicating with alcohol.

46:08.402 --> 46:10.504
But, um...

46:12.839 --> 46:16.510
...he told me that
the nightmares went away

46:16.543 --> 46:18.545
when he started seeing you.

46:20.982 --> 46:23.283
I didn't know that.

46:26.753 --> 46:28.488
May I ask...

46:28.522 --> 46:30.891
why does your mum
hate him so much?

46:30.925 --> 46:33.326
Um, Hardin's your son...

46:33.928 --> 46:36.196
Yes, and I love him,

46:36.663 --> 46:39.900
but he is <i>not</i> without
his challenges.

46:39.934 --> 46:44.438
You can tell me.
What happened between you two?

46:46.707 --> 46:48.809
He lied to me.

46:49.409 --> 46:51.979
- A big lie?
- A massive lie.

46:53.313 --> 46:55.415
Is he sorry?

46:57.317 --> 46:58.852
He is.

46:58.885 --> 47:02.389
What are you
two gabbing on about?

47:02.422 --> 47:04.424
Make sure you
brush your teeth.

47:04.458 --> 47:07.527
He used to give me such a hard
time about brushing his teeth.

47:07.561 --> 47:09.262
Mum, for the love of God,

47:09.296 --> 47:10.932
of course I'm gonna
brush my teeth.

47:10.965 --> 47:13.034
Great. Morning!

47:13.067 --> 47:16.303
Morning. Thank you.

47:16.938 --> 47:19.006
I love your mom.

47:19.673 --> 47:21.775
She's all right.

47:24.578 --> 47:26.680
Happy belated.

47:27.181 --> 47:29.649
But you already
got me a gift.

47:29.683 --> 47:31.685
True, but you
had to snoop around

47:31.718 --> 47:33.653
and open it without me,
thus denying me

47:33.687 --> 47:36.656
the pleasure of watching
you react to said gift.

47:36.690 --> 47:38.792
Therefore...

47:39.860 --> 47:41.963
"Tessa's perfect day."

47:43.497 --> 47:45.565
What's my perfect day?

47:45.599 --> 47:47.534
Well, that's for you to decide.

47:47.567 --> 47:49.736
Whatever your wish or desire,

47:49.770 --> 47:54.574
I will agree to without
any snide remarks or tantrums.

47:54.608 --> 47:57.912
Your time starts in three,
two, one.

47:59.880 --> 48:01.916
Isn't this nice?

48:01.949 --> 48:05.086
I always wanted
to go ice skating.

48:05.119 --> 48:07.821
Yeah, it's... great.
I'm loving...

48:07.854 --> 48:09.991
Unhh! Unh...

48:10.024 --> 48:12.059
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

48:12.093 --> 48:13.760
Just a tad rusty.

48:13.794 --> 48:15.595
When was the last time
you skated?

48:15.629 --> 48:17.864
I've never skated before.

48:17.898 --> 48:19.533
Do you want me
to get you a walker?

48:19.566 --> 48:21.735
You're doing great.

48:21.768 --> 48:24.005
Fuck no!

48:24.038 --> 48:27.774
Are you... Oh, it's okay. It's... it's okay.

48:27.808 --> 48:29.911
Whoo.

48:30.443 --> 48:32.746
- Are you okay?
- Yup.

48:33.080 --> 48:35.382
Do you want to stop?

48:35.615 --> 48:37.851
No.
We're here to have...

48:38.819 --> 48:41.788
Unhh! Aaah!

48:41.822 --> 48:44.624
Hardin?
I have a better idea.

48:44.658 --> 48:46.994
Stretch out into
Child's Pose,

48:47.028 --> 48:51.065
and let the day's
tension just melt away.

48:51.098 --> 48:53.633
It's not the pose
melting this tension away,

48:53.667 --> 48:55.669
- it's the fucking heat.
- Shh!

48:55.702 --> 48:58.405
- Is there any air-conditioning?
- It's hot yoga.

48:58.438 --> 49:01.474
From Child's Pose,
lift, and slowly press back

49:01.508 --> 49:04.544
into your Downward Facing Dog.

49:04.578 --> 49:06.013
Did anyone ever tell you

49:06.047 --> 49:08.648
you have the most amazing bum?

49:08.682 --> 49:10.417
Stop.

49:10.450 --> 49:13.420
...and slowly move into
<i>salamba sarvangasana.</i>

49:13.453 --> 49:15.957
Excuse me,
is this beginner's yoga?

49:15.990 --> 49:20.027
That was at ten-thirty.
This is acro-yoga.

49:21.695 --> 49:25.732
...and then lift
them up and towards the ceiling.

49:25.765 --> 49:27.868
Breathe together.

49:30.737 --> 49:33.874
Inhale, lift your arms overhead.

49:35.842 --> 49:38.612
And as you exhale,
lean forward.

49:38.645 --> 49:42.782
Allow your partner's weight to lean into you.

49:42.816 --> 49:45.485
Slowly breathe and
open your legs and...

49:45.518 --> 49:47.621
wider... inhale...

49:49.023 --> 49:50.724
a little wider...

49:50.757 --> 49:54.527
and if you can,
put your legs even wider.

50:01.202 --> 50:04.437
Is yoga supposed
to be a turn-on?

50:06.873 --> 50:09.143
Are you turned on?

50:09.176 --> 50:10.710
Mm-hmm.

50:10.744 --> 50:12.679
- Can we leave then?
- Mm-hmm.

50:12.712 --> 50:15.815
- Now? Let's go.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

50:16.683 --> 50:18.785
Sweaty! I am sweaty!

50:19.086 --> 50:21.923
Wait! Just give me
five minutes, okay?

50:21.956 --> 50:24.791
I just need to get...

50:29.964 --> 50:32.066
Oh, my God. Hardin.

50:35.635 --> 50:39.606
Let's get these off.

50:43.543 --> 50:45.212
Okay, we're getting somewhere!

51:23.017 --> 51:25.086
Oh, shit!

52:21.608 --> 52:23.843
It's my boss,
I have to get this.

52:23.877 --> 52:25.980
Are you serious?

52:26.414 --> 52:29.183
Hi! Kimberly,
what's wrong?

52:31.152 --> 52:33.287
Oh, no. How can we help?

52:33.988 --> 52:35.122
Hmm.

52:35.156 --> 52:36.589
Hi.

52:36.623 --> 52:38.926
You have no idea
how much of a lifesaver

52:38.959 --> 52:40.127
the two of you are right now.

52:40.161 --> 52:41.795
God, poor Vance
caught this bug

52:41.828 --> 52:43.863
and he's throwing up
everywhere.

52:43.897 --> 52:45.799
It's no problem.

52:45.832 --> 52:48.969
Okay, who are you and what
have you done with Hardin?

52:49.003 --> 52:51.604
It's part of my birthday present.
I'll tell you later.

52:51.638 --> 52:54.141
Ohh! I'm running so late.

52:54.175 --> 52:57.945
I'll be back in a few hours,
okay? You're in good hands.

52:57.978 --> 53:00.847
- Bye.
- Thank you.

53:03.918 --> 53:06.020
Hi.

53:06.053 --> 53:10.024
Um, so, we have the
whole afternoon together.

53:10.057 --> 53:13.294
- Is there anything that you want to do?
- No.

53:13.327 --> 53:15.930
I could get us some markers
and we can draw!

53:15.963 --> 53:17.764
I don't like to draw.

53:17.797 --> 53:19.899
No? Are you hungry?

53:21.835 --> 53:23.938
No.

53:33.780 --> 53:36.816
Wanna tell me
about your trains?

53:39.686 --> 53:41.888
Okay, I don't want
to hear about them anyway.

53:41.922 --> 53:43.890
What are those marks
on your arm?

53:43.924 --> 53:45.392
My tattoos.

53:45.426 --> 53:48.162
- Why do you have them?
- Because I like them.

53:48.195 --> 53:49.896
Don't people think
it looks strange?

53:49.930 --> 53:51.831
I don't give a fuck
what people think.

53:51.865 --> 53:53.968
Which people don't you
give a fuck about?

53:54.001 --> 53:56.270
- Oh, shit. Don't say fuck.
- Shit.

53:56.303 --> 53:58.072
Fuck. Shit.

53:58.105 --> 54:00.174
Fucky fuck. Shit...

54:01.008 --> 54:03.110
- Hey. So...
- Hi!

54:03.344 --> 54:05.346
he is actually hungry now.
We need to get him some...

54:05.379 --> 54:06.846
Fuck. Shit.

54:06.880 --> 54:08.249
Uh, I can go if you want.

54:08.282 --> 54:10.017
- Or you could.
- No, it's fine.

54:10.050 --> 54:11.952
- I'll get us some sandwiches.
- Perfect.

54:11.986 --> 54:14.321
- Thank you so much.
- Whoo! Okay!

54:14.355 --> 54:15.688
- See you later. Bye-bye.
- Okay, bye!

54:15.722 --> 54:18.159
Shit. Fuck. Shit.

54:20.760 --> 54:22.862
Go ahead.

54:25.166 --> 54:27.767
Here,
I can take those now.

54:28.035 --> 54:30.404
You know, she really
brings out the best in you.

54:30.437 --> 54:32.940
Is it that obvious?

54:32.973 --> 54:34.942
Have a nice holiday.

54:34.975 --> 54:37.077
You too.

54:38.479 --> 54:39.846
See ya, mate.

54:39.879 --> 54:41.982
See ya, mate.

54:48.455 --> 54:50.124
You ready?

54:50.157 --> 54:53.227
Yeah. Uh, we're
the last ones here,

54:53.260 --> 54:55.496
so I just have
to set the alarm.

54:55.529 --> 54:57.830
Merry Christmas.

54:59.533 --> 55:02.136
Christmas is next week.

55:04.138 --> 55:07.908
I've never been one
to follow the rules.

55:14.248 --> 55:16.350
It says "Whatever our souls
are made of..."

55:16.383 --> 55:19.086
"His and mine
are the same."

55:23.123 --> 55:25.226
What's wrong?

55:28.929 --> 55:34.301
I didn't think that I'd see you over the
holidays, so I didn't get you anything.

55:34.335 --> 55:37.204
Is there anything
that you want?

55:40.040 --> 55:42.076
Another chance?

55:44.744 --> 55:47.414
Do you promise to act
like this every day?

55:47.448 --> 55:49.749
No.

55:52.052 --> 55:54.154
But I'll try.

56:01.929 --> 56:04.031
Whatever it takes.

56:31.458 --> 56:34.328
We can't do this here.
What if someone comes in?

56:34.361 --> 56:37.498
Helloooo?
Anyone here?

56:38.098 --> 56:40.100
Anyone?!

56:40.134 --> 56:44.905
You just have an answer
for everything, don't you?

56:58.218 --> 56:59.987
It's fake.

57:00.020 --> 57:02.089
Shit.

58:29.676 --> 58:32.679
There's no one else
for me, Tessa.

58:32.713 --> 58:35.015
No one.

58:39.052 --> 58:41.155
I love you.

58:41.455 --> 58:44.191
I love you too.

58:45.225 --> 58:50.431
Don't say "too." Sounds like
you're agreeing with me.

58:51.365 --> 58:53.467
I love you, Hardin.

59:25.766 --> 59:27.367
<i>Trish.</i>

59:27.401 --> 59:28.569
Yeah, it's Ken.

59:28.602 --> 59:30.704
This is a surprise.

59:30.737 --> 59:33.974
So listen, um,
my wife Karen and I

59:35.242 --> 59:38.712
are having people over
for Christmas, and...

59:38.745 --> 59:42.282
we would love it if you and
Hardin and Tessa could join us.

59:42.316 --> 59:46.620
Well, I'm leaving for London
today, but, um...

59:46.653 --> 59:49.022
the flight's not
until this evening,

59:49.056 --> 59:51.191
so I think
we can pop over.

59:51.225 --> 59:52.793
It would mean the world to me.

59:52.826 --> 59:56.230
I guess we'll see you later,
then.

59:56.263 --> 59:58.565
Merry Christmas, Trish.

01:00:00.834 --> 01:00:02.336
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:00:02.369 --> 01:00:03.470
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:00:03.504 --> 01:00:05.639
Oh! I'm so proud of you.

01:00:06.073 --> 01:00:08.375
Can't wait to meet her.

01:00:31.865 --> 01:00:34.167
This is his <i>house?</i>

01:00:35.235 --> 01:00:37.571
- I told you.
- For fuck's sake,

01:00:37.604 --> 01:00:40.307
I didn't think
it was <i>this</i> big.

01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:42.309
Mum, we don't
have to do this.

01:00:42.342 --> 01:00:46.580
Look, the last time I saw
your dad was ten years ago.

01:00:46.613 --> 01:00:48.815
It's time. Come on.

01:00:53.186 --> 01:00:54.821
- Hi. Karen?
- Yes, hi.

01:00:54.855 --> 01:00:56.256
Thank you for having us.

01:01:30.324 --> 01:01:32.759
Well, come on.
Merry Christmas.

01:01:50.912 --> 01:01:54.147
This humble one,
right here now,

01:01:54.615 --> 01:01:57.484
he just co-authored
a new interpretation

01:01:57.517 --> 01:01:59.319
of <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>

01:01:59.353 --> 01:02:00.854
with the head of
the English department.

01:02:00.887 --> 01:02:03.290
It's not a big deal.

01:02:03.323 --> 01:02:04.891
It <i>is</i> a big deal!

01:02:14.601 --> 01:02:16.203
...directed that to perfection.

01:02:16.236 --> 01:02:18.705
That third act
had me in tears.

01:02:18.739 --> 01:02:20.574
We saw it twice.

01:02:51.238 --> 01:02:52.839
<i>Uber's gonna be here</i>

01:02:52.873 --> 01:02:54.775
- in five minutes.
- Oh!

01:02:54.808 --> 01:02:56.677
Well, I'm glad
you stopped by.

01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:58.412
Me too.

01:02:58.445 --> 01:03:00.380
Dinner should
be ready shortly.

01:03:00.414 --> 01:03:02.917
Okay, I hope everybody
has a hearty appetite.

01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:04.986
- Absolutely!
- Karen is a dynamite cook.

01:03:05.019 --> 01:03:06.954
Yes, she is.

01:03:06.988 --> 01:03:08.722
Where'd you go?

01:03:08.755 --> 01:03:10.457
Just for a walk.

01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:12.259
So Trish,
I hear that

01:03:12.292 --> 01:03:13.660
this is your first time
in the States?

01:03:13.694 --> 01:03:15.662
- Yeah, it is.
- And how do you like it?

01:03:15.696 --> 01:03:17.798
There's a lot to see.

01:03:17.831 --> 01:03:20.901
It's kind of worn out
its welcome, if you ask me.

01:03:20.935 --> 01:03:24.237
Be happy to get back home
once I graduate.

01:03:24.271 --> 01:03:26.873
You're moving back to England
after graduation?

01:03:26.908 --> 01:03:29.209
Yeah, of course I am.

01:03:29.443 --> 01:03:32.312
Trish, can I get you
another glass before you leave us?

01:03:32.345 --> 01:03:33.915
No. But it was lovely.
Thank you.

01:03:33.948 --> 01:03:35.549
I'm so glad you like it.

01:03:35.582 --> 01:03:37.317
We got it in Greece
on our honeymoon.

01:03:37.350 --> 01:03:39.486
I stuck to Pellegrino.

01:03:39.519 --> 01:03:42.656
We stayed in
this gorgeous villa.

01:03:42.957 --> 01:03:46.293
Did you know that
the beaches in Santorini

01:03:46.326 --> 01:03:48.462
are made up of
volcanic pebbles,

01:03:48.495 --> 01:03:51.631
so there's no sand
to make the water murky.

01:03:51.665 --> 01:03:53.867
So it is a crystal-clear...

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:56.536
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Hardin.

01:03:56.570 --> 01:03:58.805
- Excuse me?
- Look at your fucking trousers.

01:03:58.839 --> 01:04:00.440
I'm sorry, Mum,
but seriously,

01:04:00.474 --> 01:04:02.275
do you have any sensitivity
whatsoever?

01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:04.678
You're just boorishly droning on

01:04:04.711 --> 01:04:06.780
with no regard for
the lives you destroyed.

01:04:06.813 --> 01:04:10.517
P-Perhaps we could find
a more private place

01:04:10.550 --> 01:04:13.620
- to have this conversation.
- By all means.

01:04:13.653 --> 01:04:16.256
It's Bill Gates.

01:04:17.691 --> 01:04:20.427
Okay, well, you are obviously
quite upset with me,

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:22.829
so go ahead and say
what's on your mind.

01:04:22.863 --> 01:04:24.731
Why did you even
invite us here?

01:04:24.765 --> 01:04:26.700
I invited you here
because you're my family.

01:04:26.733 --> 01:04:28.902
We're not your family.
We <i>were</i> your family.

01:04:28.936 --> 01:04:31.571
- You ran out and reinvented...
- Hardin, I thought we were past this.

01:04:31.605 --> 01:04:34.075
We didn't get past it. How were
we supposed to get past it?

01:04:34.108 --> 01:04:36.576
You haven't owned up
to anything!

01:04:36.610 --> 01:04:38.712
Your twelve steps...
making amends.

01:04:38.745 --> 01:04:41.648
Where's Mum's amends?
Mum, have you got your amends yet?

01:04:41.681 --> 01:04:43.350
What would you
like me to do?

01:04:43.383 --> 01:04:44.751
You don't think that
I am consumed by guilt?

01:04:44.785 --> 01:04:47.387
I knew that night
that I had to go.

01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:49.589
No! After that night
you had to <i>stay!</i>

01:04:49.623 --> 01:04:51.858
And you didn't!
That night happened <i>because</i> of you!

01:04:51.892 --> 01:04:54.327
Yes! And I have been haunted
by it for the last ten years!

01:04:54.361 --> 01:04:56.830
It haunts you?!
I fucking watched it happen,

01:04:56.863 --> 01:04:59.733
you bastard!

01:05:05.039 --> 01:05:07.374
I'm sorry, Mum.

01:05:07.407 --> 01:05:09.476
I <i>had</i> to.

01:05:10.044 --> 01:05:13.580
No, wait. You don't have to get an Uber.
I can give you a ride.

01:05:13.613 --> 01:05:15.917
After the shit
you've just pulled?

01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:18.618
Not to mention
you're drunk.

01:05:18.652 --> 01:05:20.720
Look, I'm sorry
I'm not like you.

01:05:20.754 --> 01:05:23.623
You may be able to forget
everything he did, but I can't.

01:05:23.657 --> 01:05:26.060
I haven't forgotten anything.

01:05:26.093 --> 01:05:30.597
I've <i>chosen</i> to forgive him
so that <i>I</i> can move on.

01:05:31.498 --> 01:05:35.136
Hardin, resentments like this
are gonna destroy you.

01:05:35.169 --> 01:05:39.873
And they're gonna take Tessa
right down with you.

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.862
I'm going for a walk.

01:06:12.706 --> 01:06:15.042
Fuck!

01:06:40.935 --> 01:06:43.737
Hardin.

01:06:46.207 --> 01:06:48.475
Hardin.

01:06:48.508 --> 01:06:50.077
Hardin!

01:07:29.849 --> 01:07:31.953
Hold that, please!

01:07:32.954 --> 01:07:35.056
Oh.

01:07:37.158 --> 01:07:41.262
And I thought I was the only Grinch
who worked the day after Christmas.

01:07:41.295 --> 01:07:44.031
We have gotta stop
meeting like this.

01:07:44.065 --> 01:07:48.135
You're right. I'll have restraining
orders drafted immediately.

01:07:48.169 --> 01:07:49.869
How was your Christmas?

01:07:49.903 --> 01:07:52.006
Uneventful. Yours?

01:07:52.772 --> 01:07:54.874
Eventful.

01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:57.711
That's a loaded response.

01:08:00.247 --> 01:08:03.050
Well, I'd love to hear more
about your eventful Christmas,

01:08:03.084 --> 01:08:04.851
so... lunch?

01:08:04.884 --> 01:08:06.187
Postmates. I'm buying.

01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.189
How could I refuse?

01:08:08.222 --> 01:08:10.824
Great. I'll email you
some menus.

01:08:10.857 --> 01:08:13.727
I know,
very chivalrous of me.

01:08:17.231 --> 01:08:22.002
I thought that things were
getting better, but...

01:08:22.036 --> 01:08:25.939
it's clear that he still has a
lot of stuff he has to deal with.

01:08:25.973 --> 01:08:29.109
And I just feel
really bad for him...

01:08:29.143 --> 01:08:31.745
and I don't know
how to fix it.

01:08:31.778 --> 01:08:34.081
Well, let me ask you this.

01:08:35.116 --> 01:08:37.550
Are you in love with him?

01:08:38.285 --> 01:08:41.821
- I am.
- Then you got yourself a problem.

01:08:43.857 --> 01:08:45.692
Those are your
words of wisdom?

01:08:45.725 --> 01:08:48.095
Hey, I never said I had
any words of wisdom.

01:08:48.129 --> 01:08:53.633
No, you just wanted to know
whether I actually loved him.

01:08:53.666 --> 01:08:55.970
I should get back to work.

01:08:57.337 --> 01:09:00.041
Thank you for lunch.
Next time it's on me.

01:09:00.073 --> 01:09:03.344
I don't think there's
gonna be a next time.

01:09:03.377 --> 01:09:04.877
Ouch.

01:09:04.912 --> 01:09:07.613
No, not like that,
believe me.

01:09:07.647 --> 01:09:09.316
I'm moving to Seattle.

01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:12.252
Vance offered me the Head of
Finance position at the new office.

01:09:12.286 --> 01:09:14.154
Oh, my God.
Trevor, that's amazing.

01:09:14.188 --> 01:09:16.122
Thanks.

01:09:16.157 --> 01:09:18.292
Well, ya know,
I don't leave tomorrow.

01:09:18.325 --> 01:09:20.094
We could still... that's...

01:09:20.127 --> 01:09:22.895
No, that's stupid.

01:09:31.104 --> 01:09:33.207
Tessa.

01:09:33.908 --> 01:09:39.345
My sister has struggled
with addiction her whole life.

01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:41.648
This thing between
you and Hardin...

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.917
it's not gonna end well.

01:09:47.421 --> 01:09:49.721
Well, you're wrong.

01:10:26.961 --> 01:10:29.363
This one's better
anyway.

01:10:42.309 --> 01:10:46.347
You're never gonna show me what
you're writing in there, are you?

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:48.681
Maybe... someday.

01:10:56.123 --> 01:10:58.058
You don't wanna see
who that is?

01:10:58.092 --> 01:11:00.194
I know who it is.

01:11:00.227 --> 01:11:01.828
It's Steph.

01:11:01.861 --> 01:11:06.066
The frat house is having
a New Year's Eve party.

01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:08.202
Right.

01:11:08.435 --> 01:11:10.104
Do you wanna go?

01:11:10.137 --> 01:11:13.806
No. I don't wanna
leave you here alone.

01:11:14.475 --> 01:11:16.809
I wouldn't be alone.

01:11:16.843 --> 01:11:18.946
I'd go with you.

01:11:20.147 --> 01:11:23.284
Sorry, I... I just thought
after everything that happened

01:11:23.317 --> 01:11:25.152
- that you wouldn't want to...
- I'm not scared of them.

01:11:25.186 --> 01:11:27.354
Besides, if it
blows up in my face,

01:11:27.388 --> 01:11:30.723
then we can just
stay in next year.

01:11:40.201 --> 01:11:42.303
What was that for?

01:11:45.139 --> 01:11:48.741
I just loved
how you said "next year."

01:11:54.481 --> 01:11:56.016
Hello?

01:11:56.050 --> 01:11:57.451
Tessa, why aren't you
in the office?

01:11:57.484 --> 01:11:59.153
Well, yeah, I...
I thought it was...

01:11:59.186 --> 01:12:00.521
I'm kidding.
Happy New Year.

01:12:00.554 --> 01:12:02.990
Yes!

01:12:03.023 --> 01:12:04.757
You got me.

01:12:04.791 --> 01:12:06.427
<i>I'll cut to the chase.</i>

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:08.395
We went with the manuscript
you recommended,

01:12:08.429 --> 01:12:10.464
and it sold today
in quite a bidding war.

01:12:10.497 --> 01:12:13.367
Wow, that's...
that's fantastic.

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.169
<i>Listen, we were
gonna hire someone</i>

01:12:15.202 --> 01:12:16.903
<i>to do digital submissions
in Seattle, but...</i>

01:12:16.937 --> 01:12:19.340
you're better than anyone
I've interviewed.

01:12:19.373 --> 01:12:21.774
<i>I'll take care of your tuition,
living expenses, provided you transfer.</i>

01:12:21.808 --> 01:12:25.479
Obviously, Hardin's welcome
to join you.

01:12:25.512 --> 01:12:26.813
Wow, that...

01:12:26.846 --> 01:12:29.816
uh, that sounds
really amazing.

01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:34.288
Um, can you give me a chance
to think about it, please?

01:12:34.321 --> 01:12:35.923
<i>Of course. I just wanted</i>

01:12:35.956 --> 01:12:37.291
to share the good news.

01:12:37.324 --> 01:12:39.193
Happy New Year, Tess.

01:12:39.226 --> 01:12:41.328
Happy New Year, sir.

01:12:44.131 --> 01:12:45.466
Hey.

01:12:45.499 --> 01:12:47.501
Were you talking to me?

01:12:47.534 --> 01:12:49.003
Nope.

01:12:49.036 --> 01:12:51.272
What is taking so long?

01:12:51.305 --> 01:12:53.007
Being a woman.

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.276
Now, can you go wait outside?

01:12:55.309 --> 01:12:57.411
- So sorry.
- Thanks.

01:13:07.254 --> 01:13:09.356
Undefeated!

01:13:10.190 --> 01:13:11.558
Fuck!

01:13:11.592 --> 01:13:14.295
- It's okay.
- Sorry. Sorry.

01:13:17.097 --> 01:13:18.599
We've missed you.

01:13:18.632 --> 01:13:19.899
Are we good?

01:13:19.933 --> 01:13:21.602
Ancient history.

01:13:21.635 --> 01:13:23.170
You guys
wanna get in on this?

01:13:23.203 --> 01:13:24.438
Yeah, you can
take my place.

01:13:24.471 --> 01:13:26.573
Go. I'll watch.

01:13:27.541 --> 01:13:29.143
I like to watch.

01:13:29.176 --> 01:13:31.345
Yeah, I bet you do.

01:13:31.378 --> 01:13:33.447
Okay, sure.

01:13:33.747 --> 01:13:35.249
You know what you're doing,
right?

01:13:35.282 --> 01:13:37.318
- Not a clue.
- Awesome.

01:13:37.351 --> 01:13:39.453
Great.

01:13:41.322 --> 01:13:43.823
Tessa!

01:13:45.025 --> 01:13:46.360
Mmm.

01:13:46.393 --> 01:13:47.528
Mm.

01:13:47.561 --> 01:13:48.895
What is that?

01:13:48.929 --> 01:13:50.497
Cherry vodka sour.

01:13:50.531 --> 01:13:52.832
Cool.

01:13:57.004 --> 01:13:59.106
This is fun!

01:14:04.078 --> 01:14:06.180
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:14:11.518 --> 01:14:14.521
Drink, bitch!

01:14:14.555 --> 01:14:16.623
Whoo! I like this!

01:14:16.657 --> 01:14:19.460
- Nice job! One more!
- Aowww!

01:14:28.369 --> 01:14:30.870
I... suck at this.

01:14:32.139 --> 01:14:34.241
Jamie. Hey.

01:14:36.677 --> 01:14:38.946
- It <i>is</i> you.
- Hi.

01:14:39.313 --> 01:14:41.181
Can I talk to you
upstairs?

01:14:41.215 --> 01:14:43.317
Lead the way.

01:14:57.197 --> 01:14:59.299
Molly's here!

01:15:00.634 --> 01:15:02.936
You fucking kidding me?

01:15:04.571 --> 01:15:06.673
Fuck this.

01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:12.613
So cool,
all those gears.

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.082
You're like a robot.

01:15:15.115 --> 01:15:16.517
Who says I'm not?

01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:19.186
I have a tattoo
of a little butterfly,

01:15:19.219 --> 01:15:22.089
but you can only see it
when I'm naked.

01:15:22.122 --> 01:15:24.191
- I love butterflies.
- Really?

01:15:24.224 --> 01:15:26.293
Yeah.

01:15:32.332 --> 01:15:35.102
Hey!
I was looking for you.

01:15:35.135 --> 01:15:37.237
Hey. Let's leave.

01:15:37.604 --> 01:15:39.706
Okay.

01:15:44.344 --> 01:15:48.482
Aww. If it isn't the cute
couple together again.

01:15:48.515 --> 01:15:50.651
Oh, yay. It's Molly.

01:15:50.684 --> 01:15:52.486
- Where you guys going?
- We're going home.

01:15:52.519 --> 01:15:55.422
Ohh. Lame. Come on,
it's almost New Year's.

01:15:55.456 --> 01:15:58.258
- We just wanna be alone.
- Let's go.

01:15:58.292 --> 01:16:01.995
Good. She never really
fit in, anyway.

01:16:03.363 --> 01:16:04.698
One drink.

01:16:04.731 --> 01:16:07.067
What... Tess.

01:16:13.474 --> 01:16:17.444
Excuse me, lovebirds,
you're on my chair.

01:16:17.744 --> 01:16:20.180
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Now, fuck off.

01:16:20.214 --> 01:16:21.482
Move.

01:16:21.515 --> 01:16:23.617
Bitch.

01:16:30.324 --> 01:16:32.626
Yes, I am <i>druuuunk!</i>

01:16:34.294 --> 01:16:36.463
Would anybody like some weed brownies?
I made 'em myself.

01:16:36.497 --> 01:16:38.599
- No.
- Oh, I'm good.

01:16:39.266 --> 01:16:41.668
Well, this is fun.
Can we leave?

01:16:41.702 --> 01:16:43.070
We should play a game.

01:16:43.103 --> 01:16:44.371
Like what, Scrabble?

01:16:44.404 --> 01:16:46.206
How about...

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.542
- Truth or Dare?
- Jesus Christ.

01:16:48.575 --> 01:16:50.611
- Why is that bad?
- Long story.

01:16:50.644 --> 01:16:53.113
- Why would you say that?
- Because.

01:16:53.146 --> 01:16:56.650
What's the matter, Hardin?
Scared of a little Truth or Dare?

01:16:56.683 --> 01:16:58.785
Fuck you, Molly.

01:16:59.019 --> 01:17:00.354
I'll go first.

01:17:00.387 --> 01:17:02.422
Hey, Tess, truth or dare?

01:17:02.456 --> 01:17:04.124
Truth.

01:17:04.157 --> 01:17:05.659
Uh, are you a virgin?

01:17:05.692 --> 01:17:07.361
Molly, don't.

01:17:07.394 --> 01:17:09.596
Oh. Duh. I already know
the answer to that,

01:17:09.630 --> 01:17:11.265
because Hardin fucked you.

01:17:11.298 --> 01:17:13.333
Yes, he did.

01:17:13.367 --> 01:17:15.736
My turn. Molly,
truth or dare?

01:17:15.769 --> 01:17:18.071
Hmm, truth.

01:17:20.173 --> 01:17:22.075
Is it true that
you're a whore?

01:17:22.109 --> 01:17:23.677
Oh, shit.

01:17:23.710 --> 01:17:26.079
What the fuck did
you just call me?

01:17:26.113 --> 01:17:29.216
I didn't call you anything.
I just asked you a question.

01:17:29.249 --> 01:17:31.118
Are you a whore?

01:17:31.151 --> 01:17:33.186
- You are.
- You have to answer honestly,

01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:36.189
because it's called
Truth for a reason.

01:17:36.223 --> 01:17:38.358
No.

01:17:38.392 --> 01:17:39.593
Do they not like each other?

01:17:39.626 --> 01:17:41.194
Hey, Tess,
my turn again.

01:17:41.228 --> 01:17:42.796
- Truth or dare?
- Truth.

01:17:42.829 --> 01:17:44.364
Is it true that
you're a dumb-ass

01:17:44.398 --> 01:17:46.233
for getting back together
with Hardin

01:17:46.266 --> 01:17:48.302
after he clearly fucked you
for a bet?

01:17:48.335 --> 01:17:50.437
Let's go.

01:17:50.737 --> 01:17:52.239
No, that's not true.

01:17:52.272 --> 01:17:54.374
Oh... but it is.

01:17:54.408 --> 01:17:56.443
You believe anything
that comes out of his mouth.

01:17:56.476 --> 01:17:58.245
I fucking hate you, Molly.

01:17:58.278 --> 01:17:59.680
Which I don't blame you,

01:17:59.713 --> 01:18:02.416
because, oh, man,
what that mouth can do.

01:18:02.449 --> 01:18:04.551
And that tongue...

01:18:15.495 --> 01:18:17.598
Get away from me!

01:18:21.602 --> 01:18:24.171
- You, like that, whore!
- Ohh!

01:18:33.547 --> 01:18:35.616
Tessa, relax!

01:18:36.316 --> 01:18:37.284
Awww...

01:18:40.354 --> 01:18:41.888
You're a <i>whore!</i>

01:18:41.923 --> 01:18:43.857
Get that fuckin' bitch
out of here!

01:18:43.890 --> 01:18:45.826
Happy new year, bitch!

01:18:45.859 --> 01:18:47.394
Fuck you, Tessa!

01:18:47.427 --> 01:18:49.529
Get off me!

01:18:49.863 --> 01:18:51.798
And you, move the fuck
out of my way!

01:18:58.271 --> 01:19:01.742
- ...UFC or some..
- UFC?

01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:05.712
I needed that.

01:19:05.746 --> 01:19:07.848
I'll bet you did.

01:19:08.148 --> 01:19:10.217
- Ahhh.
- You're crazy.

01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:12.352
I know.

01:19:20.394 --> 01:19:22.863
Aaah!

01:19:31.838 --> 01:19:34.608
Pants.

01:19:38.679 --> 01:19:40.681
Ms. Young, are you
objectifying me?

01:19:40.714 --> 01:19:42.883
Why, yes, I am,
Mr. Scott.

01:19:44.785 --> 01:19:47.254
Right.

01:19:47.287 --> 01:19:49.322
Three minutes till New Year!

01:19:49.356 --> 01:19:50.791
Whooo!

01:20:02.335 --> 01:20:04.471
Is the door locked?

01:20:04.504 --> 01:20:06.506
Fuck the door,
I don't know.

01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:09.276
- Oh, my God.
- Am I your god?

01:20:09.309 --> 01:20:11.411
Yeah!

01:20:12.512 --> 01:20:13.915
Thirty seconds!

01:20:13.948 --> 01:20:15.382
Whooo!

01:20:15.415 --> 01:20:18.485
Fuck off!

01:20:18.518 --> 01:20:20.988
Fourteen, thirteen,

01:20:21.855 --> 01:20:23.958
twelve, eleven, ten,

01:20:24.192 --> 01:20:26.693
<i>nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

01:20:28.628 --> 01:20:30.464
five, four,

01:20:30.497 --> 01:20:32.599
<i>three, two, one!</i>

01:20:41.943 --> 01:20:44.244
We're set.

01:20:44.946 --> 01:20:47.247
Hey.

01:20:50.617 --> 01:20:53.320
I'm gonna use
the bathroom.

01:20:58.358 --> 01:21:00.928
Tessa, your phone.

01:21:00.962 --> 01:21:03.730
- <i>What?</i>
- Your phone.

01:21:21.115 --> 01:21:23.550
Hardin?

01:21:25.086 --> 01:21:26.753
Hey, you!

01:21:26.787 --> 01:21:28.923
- Happy New Year.
- Hey.

01:21:29.623 --> 01:21:31.092
I'm really glad
we did that.

01:21:31.125 --> 01:21:32.726
Me too.

01:21:32.759 --> 01:21:34.528
Do me a favor and just
keep it between us?

01:21:34.561 --> 01:21:37.397
Of course.
I never kiss and tell.

01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:39.533
Thank you.

01:21:40.433 --> 01:21:42.003
Uh-oh.

01:21:42.036 --> 01:21:44.105
You piece of shit!

01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:47.774
Tessa, wait!

01:21:47.808 --> 01:21:50.777
- Hey. Hey!
- Just hear me out.

01:21:50.811 --> 01:21:52.712
What the fuck?!

01:21:52.746 --> 01:21:54.681
- Dude, she kissed <i>me.</i>
- Fuck off!

01:21:54.714 --> 01:21:57.751
Tessa, what the fuck!
How can you do that?!

01:21:57.784 --> 01:22:00.021
Why do you care, huh?
You just kissed that girl.

01:22:00.054 --> 01:22:01.822
No, no, no,
you don't get to cry!

01:22:01.855 --> 01:22:04.125
You just fucking kissed a guy
right in front of me!

01:22:04.158 --> 01:22:06.127
- And what did you do, huh?
- Nothing!

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:08.029
- The fuck is wrong with you?!
- She just said

01:22:08.062 --> 01:22:11.531
that she doesn't kiss and tell,
you fucking liar!

01:22:11.565 --> 01:22:13.466
It's a figure of speech!

01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.602
You should know I would
never fucking cheat on you!

01:22:15.635 --> 01:22:19.941
Were you with her tonight? Is she who
you disappeared with the whole night?!

01:22:19.974 --> 01:22:21.909
Yes!

01:22:21.943 --> 01:22:24.477
- I was trying to make her forgive me.
- For what?!

01:22:24.511 --> 01:22:29.016
Because I'm trying to be a better
person for you! That's all I fucking do!

01:22:29.050 --> 01:22:32.485
Tell me what else I can do to
make you believe that I love you.

01:22:32.519 --> 01:22:34.554
Tell me!

01:22:34.588 --> 01:22:36.656
You're never
gonna trust me.

01:22:36.690 --> 01:22:38.491
Trust you?

01:22:38.525 --> 01:22:39.893
You think that
I should trust you.

01:22:39.927 --> 01:22:40.995
Yes!

01:22:41.028 --> 01:22:43.864
Where has that
ever gotten me?

01:22:44.497 --> 01:22:47.534
You're never gonna
forgive me, are you?

01:22:47.567 --> 01:22:49.937
You're just gonna keep bringing it
up, every time.

01:22:49.971 --> 01:22:52.572
Because I don't trust you!

01:22:52.873 --> 01:22:56.143
You act like
you're so fucking innocent.

01:22:56.177 --> 01:22:57.979
Like you're perfect.

01:22:58.012 --> 01:22:59.779
Oh, fuck this.

01:22:59.813 --> 01:23:01.481
And fuck you!

01:23:01.514 --> 01:23:02.883
Fuck you too.

01:23:02.917 --> 01:23:04.784
Fuck off!

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:15.462
Hardin.

01:23:17.664 --> 01:23:19.766
Hardin?

01:23:44.491 --> 01:23:46.093
Hey.

01:23:46.127 --> 01:23:47.761
Hey.

01:23:47.794 --> 01:23:49.629
Do you have a charger?

01:23:49.663 --> 01:23:51.765
In my car.

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.535
Hardin, can you please
pick up the phone?

01:23:55.568 --> 01:23:58.072
I really need
to talk to you.

01:24:05.279 --> 01:24:07.614
Make a left on Oakwood.

01:24:37.044 --> 01:24:39.146
Hello?

01:24:45.618 --> 01:24:47.721
Oh, my God.

01:24:52.726 --> 01:24:54.561
- Stop the car.
- I can't.

01:24:54.594 --> 01:24:56.230
- Stop your fucking car!
- Okay!

01:24:59.133 --> 01:25:00.301
Tessa!

01:25:04.571 --> 01:25:06.539
Tessa! Wait! Stop!

01:25:06.573 --> 01:25:08.675
Stop! Stop!

01:25:11.946 --> 01:25:14.048
Tessa...!

01:25:24.125 --> 01:25:25.792
Theresa Young?

01:25:25.825 --> 01:25:27.928
Yes, hello?

01:25:30.264 --> 01:25:32.066
- <i>Mercy Hospital.</i>
- Hello, yes?

01:25:32.099 --> 01:25:34.168
- <i>Can I help you?</i>
- Theresa Young. She's 19.

01:25:34.201 --> 01:25:36.603
- <i>I don't see that patient.</i>
- She should be there.

01:25:36.636 --> 01:25:38.705
You're the fifth hospital
I've spoken to!

01:25:38.738 --> 01:25:43.044
- Don't fucking put... Fuck!
- Hardin!

01:25:43.944 --> 01:25:46.047
The fuck is wrong with you?
How could you do this to Tessa?

01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:47.614
- Tessa? Where is she?
- I'm not telling you.

01:25:47.647 --> 01:25:51.152
- Landon, where is she?!
- I'm not telling you!

01:25:51.185 --> 01:25:53.921
- Tell me where she is!
- It's your fault she crashed!

01:25:53.954 --> 01:25:55.789
You didn't come home
last night!

01:25:55.822 --> 01:25:57.925
Get off of me!

01:25:59.326 --> 01:26:01.295
She was out looking for you.

01:26:01.328 --> 01:26:03.630
I don't believe you.

01:26:08.936 --> 01:26:10.804
Tessa?

01:26:10.837 --> 01:26:12.940
<i>What do you want, Hardin?</i>

01:26:12.973 --> 01:26:15.209
Trevor?

01:26:15.242 --> 01:26:19.146
- Trevor, what the fuck are you doing with Tessa's phone?
- I'm with her now.

01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:21.282
- Let me talk to her.
- That's not gonna happen.

01:26:21.315 --> 01:26:23.050
Trevor, I'm not
fucking playing with you!

01:26:23.084 --> 01:26:25.618
Shut the fuck up
and listen to me.

01:26:25.652 --> 01:26:28.755
You're toxic and
you're bad news.

01:26:28.788 --> 01:26:31.858
If you love Tessa, and I
think that you do, let her go.

01:26:31.891 --> 01:26:33.227
Trevor, I just
wanna talk to her.

01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:35.362
Please. Please.

01:26:35.996 --> 01:26:38.765
Trevor, please,
just let me talk to her.

01:26:38.798 --> 01:26:40.800
Give her a chance to find
happiness in this life,

01:26:40.834 --> 01:26:44.138
'cause she's never
gonna find it with you.

01:26:44.171 --> 01:26:45.705
Here you go, hon.

01:26:45.738 --> 01:26:49.210
Hey, good news.
Vance's company policy

01:26:49.243 --> 01:26:51.912
is going to put your hospital
and car fees on it, so...

01:26:51.946 --> 01:26:54.048
Here's your phone.

01:27:00.254 --> 01:27:02.356

Hardin, help me!

01:29:23.998 --> 01:29:26.333
It's okay.

01:30:01.035 --> 01:30:03.170
Thank you.

01:30:03.203 --> 01:30:06.340
How are
the applications going?

01:30:06.373 --> 01:30:09.510
Fine. Dad said
he'd make some calls.

01:30:11.045 --> 01:30:13.247
You two spoke?

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:15.382
How'd that go?

01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:19.053
As well as it could.

01:30:20.354 --> 01:30:22.589
Hardin, what happened
that night,

01:30:22.623 --> 01:30:24.291
it wasn't his fault.

01:30:24.325 --> 01:30:26.560
And all the other nights?

01:30:26.593 --> 01:30:28.895
Not his fault?

01:30:30.431 --> 01:30:32.533
Yeah, it was shit.

01:30:32.832 --> 01:30:35.936
It was shit, and we both
deserved better.

01:30:35.969 --> 01:30:37.504
But the only person
you're punishing

01:30:37.538 --> 01:30:39.273
by not forgiving him
is yourself.

01:30:39.306 --> 01:30:44.011
And Hardin, I want you
to stop punishing yourself.

01:30:44.877 --> 01:30:47.047
So you think it's fair
that he gets to live in

01:30:47.081 --> 01:30:50.651
that big, fancy house,
and you're here all alone?

01:30:50.684 --> 01:30:52.953
Who said I was alone?

01:30:52.986 --> 01:30:55.322
What?
You're seeing someone?

01:30:55.356 --> 01:30:59.460
- You don't have to sound so surprised.
- Who?

01:30:59.793 --> 01:31:02.096
- Mike.
- Mike?

01:31:02.396 --> 01:31:05.165
- Wanker-from-next-door Mike?
- He's <i>not</i> a wanker!

01:31:05.199 --> 01:31:07.935
- He is a bit of a wanker.
- He's a really nice man,

01:31:07.968 --> 01:31:09.937
and he treats me well.

01:31:09.970 --> 01:31:12.272
Yeah, he fucking better.

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:16.477
Did you hear that Vance
was moving to Seattle?

01:31:16.510 --> 01:31:19.046
Tessa's going too.
How did you know?

01:31:19.079 --> 01:31:21.081
Well, we talk
from time to time.

01:31:21.115 --> 01:31:23.350
He's having a going-away
party on Sunday,

01:31:23.384 --> 01:31:27.020
and I think you should get your
ass off this sofa and go get her.

01:31:27.054 --> 01:31:31.325
- No, I can't.
- Can't? Or you don't want to face what you left behind?

01:31:31.358 --> 01:31:32.626
I'd have to leave right now.

01:31:32.659 --> 01:31:35.062
So what are you waiting for?

01:31:35.095 --> 01:31:37.664
- Mum, I'm not gonna...
- Hardin...

01:31:37.698 --> 01:31:44.037
I love you, but you <i>have</i> to start
fighting for what really matters.

01:31:53.981 --> 01:31:55.682
<i>Thank you all
so much for coming.</i>

01:31:55.716 --> 01:31:59.953
It means the world to me to have
everyone I love here with us.

01:31:59.987 --> 01:32:02.089
I am... beyond proud

01:32:02.389 --> 01:32:04.324
of the work that everyone
in this room has done,

01:32:04.358 --> 01:32:06.326
but there is one
particular person

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.562
I could not have done
any of this without.

01:32:08.595 --> 01:32:10.030
And that's Kimberly.

01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:17.638
Smith and I were talking
the other day,

01:32:17.671 --> 01:32:19.673
and he said, "Dad,
going-away parties are kind of sad."

01:32:19.706 --> 01:32:21.642
And he's got a point.

01:32:21.675 --> 01:32:24.244
And we were like,
"How do we make this a celebration?"

01:32:24.278 --> 01:32:26.346
Then we got an idea.

01:32:31.218 --> 01:32:34.354
Kimberly...

01:32:35.255 --> 01:32:38.325
will you marry my dad
and be my stepmom?

01:32:38.358 --> 01:32:40.461
Aww...

01:32:41.462 --> 01:32:43.664
Yes!

01:32:43.697 --> 01:32:45.566
Yes!

01:32:49.603 --> 01:32:51.205
What about me?

01:32:53.474 --> 01:32:56.109
- Aww...
- Yay!

01:33:07.354 --> 01:33:09.122
Who said happy endings
don't exist?

01:33:09.156 --> 01:33:10.724
Don't tell me.
You're the cynic.

01:33:10.757 --> 01:33:13.627
I'm turning over
a new leaf.

01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:16.597
You look very pretty,
by the way.

01:33:16.630 --> 01:33:21.134
So... have you made up
your mind about Seattle?

01:33:21.368 --> 01:33:23.770
Well, I don't see
much of a reason

01:33:23.804 --> 01:33:27.307
to pass up the opportunity
anymore.

01:33:28.642 --> 01:33:30.110
That's...

01:33:30.143 --> 01:33:31.144
really nice to hear.

01:33:32.813 --> 01:33:34.648
Look, Tessa,
there's something

01:33:34.681 --> 01:33:36.683
I actually want
to get off my chest.

01:33:36.717 --> 01:33:39.019
Okay.

01:33:39.286 --> 01:33:42.656
Uh, the other day,
in the hospital...

01:33:42.689 --> 01:33:44.558
I answered your cell phone,

01:33:44.591 --> 01:33:46.393
it was Hardin,

01:33:46.426 --> 01:33:49.630
and I told him
to stay away from you.

01:33:49.663 --> 01:33:51.532
- What?
- In retrospect,

01:33:51.565 --> 01:33:54.201
I do realize that
that was over the line,

01:33:54.234 --> 01:33:58.171
and I do realize that I let my
emotions get the best of me,

01:33:58.205 --> 01:34:00.307
and I'm sorry,

01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:04.478
but somehow you bring
that side out of me, so...

01:34:05.746 --> 01:34:08.048
Okay.

01:34:09.683 --> 01:34:11.485
Are you okay?

01:34:11.518 --> 01:34:13.387
Eh.

01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:15.589
There's actually
more I'd like to say,

01:34:15.622 --> 01:34:17.391
- but would you excuse me for a second?
- Yeah.

01:34:17.424 --> 01:34:19.526
Thanks.

01:34:41.515 --> 01:34:43.617
I'm so sorry.

01:34:55.295 --> 01:34:57.397
Shit.

01:35:01.234 --> 01:35:02.569
She left from the front.

01:35:02.603 --> 01:35:04.705
Thank you.

01:35:09.209 --> 01:35:11.311
Tessa!

01:35:24.891 --> 01:35:29.496
You're just never gonna
leave me alone, are you?

01:35:52.519 --> 01:35:54.621
I tried.

01:36:52.579 --> 01:36:54.815
So, you two have
a good Christmas?

01:36:54.848 --> 01:36:56.918
O-kay,
you're not talkin'.

01:36:56.951 --> 01:36:59.686
So... hey, so <i>I</i> was dreamin'
of a white Christmas.

01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:01.588
Hmph! All I got was heat.

01:37:01.621 --> 01:37:04.025
You know, I hate the heat.

01:37:04.058 --> 01:37:06.460
Heat get into people's minds

01:37:06.493 --> 01:37:09.429
and make them do
some crazy things.

01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:25.579
<i>Like I said,</i>

01:37:25.612 --> 01:37:28.916
<i>this is a story
you've heard before.</i>

01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:32.385
<i>Only difference is,
this is</i> our <i>story.</i>

01:37:32.419 --> 01:37:34.521
<i>Tessa's and mine.</i>

01:37:35.123 --> 01:37:37.324
"I never wish
to be parted from you

01:37:37.357 --> 01:37:39.459
from this day on."

01:37:43.764 --> 01:37:45.599
<i>And who knows?</i>

01:37:45.632 --> 01:37:49.369
<i>Maybe there is a happy ending
for us after all.</i>

01:37:49.402 --> 01:37:50.804
Tess.

01:37:50.837 --> 01:37:53.340
- Hey...
- Hardin!

01:37:54.708 --> 01:37:56.810
- Dad?
- "Dad"?

01:37:57.677 --> 01:37:59.846
<i>I guess we'll
just have to find out.</i>

01:39:38.279 --> 01:39:40.714
Tessa.
Tessa.

01:39:40.747 --> 01:39:41.882
Tessa.

01:39:41.916 --> 01:39:43.683
Do you like to go on dates?

01:39:43.717 --> 01:39:45.019
Because I don't.

01:39:45.052 --> 01:39:47.554
But I-I will... with you.

01:39:48.488 --> 01:39:49.991
If you wanna go.

01:39:51.691 --> 01:39:52.692
Tessa.

01:39:52.726 --> 01:39:54.694
That's so creepy.

01:39:54.728 --> 01:39:56.696
I've been meaning to tell you
something for a long time,

01:39:56.730 --> 01:39:58.966
and the reason
that I haven't told you

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.434
is because of Human Resources
in the workplace.

01:40:01.468 --> 01:40:03.004
Don't talk about
Human Resources.

01:40:03.037 --> 01:40:04.804
That's not... sexy.

01:40:04.838 --> 01:40:06.173
Tessa!

01:40:06.207 --> 01:40:07.909
Don't do the finger.

01:40:07.942 --> 01:40:09.076
Put it <i>down!</i>

01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:11.444
I only pull out my teal suit

01:40:11.478 --> 01:40:13.546
when I have something
important to say.

01:40:13.580 --> 01:40:15.216
Occupied.

01:40:15.249 --> 01:40:17.450
Tessa.

01:40:17.484 --> 01:40:19.153
There's other bathrooms
in the house

01:40:19.186 --> 01:40:21.888
if you need to go that badly.

01:40:23.190 --> 01:40:25.659
Just go.

01:40:25.692 --> 01:40:27.794
Yes. You can go now.
