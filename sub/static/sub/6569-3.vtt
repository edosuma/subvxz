(SIREN CHIRPING)

00:27.561 --> 00:29.234
WOMAN: Is this the last one, Leash?

00:29.329 --> 00:32.003
I cannot walk another step
with my Louboutin heels.

00:32.064 --> 00:34.067
Yeah, Louboutin. Right.

00:34.167 --> 00:36.044
And who wears fake heels at breakfast time?

00:36.136 --> 00:39.140
- Dee do.
- JONAH: Alicia? Alicia Bryce?

00:39.239 --> 00:41.981
- JONAH: Hey, you're Alicia Bryce, right?
- Who wants to know?

00:42.042 --> 00:44.522
- DEE: Curb-crawlin' asshole.
- My name's Jonah Ryan.

00:44.578 --> 00:47.559
I'm a reporter.
I am straight diggin' your campaign.

00:47.648 --> 00:49.855
- Uh-huh. What campaign?
- Your child care campaign.

00:49.917 --> 00:53.421
Your, "I live three miles from the White House,
might as well be three million miles."

00:53.987 --> 00:55.694
All right. I'll talk.

00:56.490 --> 00:59.494
That clown car got a giant clown in it.

01:00.027 --> 01:02.200
JONAH: Hold up, hold up!
Hey there! Alicia. Whoa.

01:02.262 --> 01:05.675
My web site is Ryantology.net
and I'm a storyteller.

01:05.766 --> 01:09.077
And I want to tell
real stories about real people, okay?

01:09.169 --> 01:11.843
I'm like John Steinbeck in that regard,
you know? Or Denzel Washington.

01:12.339 --> 01:14.341
- You wanna ask me a question?
-Yes.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.514
Tell me your story. Question mark.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.955
- Okay. I'm a single mom.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:20.047 --> 01:22.254
I have a six-year-old daughter named Halo.

01:22.449 --> 01:25.293
And sometimes when I take her to school,
we have some problems...

01:25.385 --> 01:26.693
JONAH: Oh, shit.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.226
- What?
- Excuse me?

01:29.423 --> 01:30.424
Ahh...

01:30.524 --> 01:33.130
Alicia? I'm Amy Brookheimer.
We spoke yesterday.

01:33.293 --> 01:35.773
- Oh, my God, yes! Yes! Hi!
- Hi! (CHUCKLES)

01:35.862 --> 01:38.604
- Hi, Amy. Great seeing you.
- ALICIA: You guys know each other?

01:38.699 --> 01:40.303
- Yeah, we dated.
- We worked together.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.074
I was kind of Amy's boss at the time.
It got complicated.

01:43.203 --> 01:44.739
But she's basically a good kid.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.944
- Um. Do you mind, maybe we can...
-Go inside?

01:47.040 --> 01:49.281
- AMY: That's a great idea.
- Yeah, that'd be great, let's go inside.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.617
- Um. Some other time.
- Okay, some other time.

01:51.712 --> 01:52.884
- All right.
- JONAH: I'm gonna hold you to that.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.926
ALICIA: All right.
JONAH: I'll see you later.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.422
- JONAH: Just sittin' on the co'ner.
- What?

01:58.485 --> 01:59.828
Nothing.

02:03.323 --> 02:07.135
Halo, baby, come out here and meet
Miss Amy from the vice president's office.

02:07.227 --> 02:09.935
Well, hello. Do you like Power Rangers?

02:11.798 --> 02:15.075
ALICIA: Okay. Well, you can go back
and sit with Grandma, okay?

02:15.268 --> 02:16.508
AMY: Well, I'm gonna get right to it.

02:16.603 --> 02:18.139
The Veep wants you to be with her

02:18.238 --> 02:20.946
when she announces
she's running for president.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.986
- Oh, my God.
- She's a really big fan of yours, Alicia.

02:24.077 --> 02:25.078
Yeah? You hear that?

02:25.245 --> 02:29.955
In fact, right now she is at her desk
patiently waiting to speak with you.

02:30.283 --> 02:34.425
Ma'am, outdoors risks
rained-on hair and running mascara.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.831
Do you want to look like Alice Cooper?

02:35.922 --> 02:38.095
My second marriage took place in the rain.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.104
And you could see my nipples
in all the photos.

02:40.193 --> 02:41.263
Oy! Shhp, boing!

02:41.361 --> 02:42.999
I'm doing the speech outside, all right?

02:43.096 --> 02:44.700
All great speeches are done outside.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.300
Gettysburg, Mount Sinai...

02:46.433 --> 02:48.504
The speech I made in
Philadelphia three weeks ago.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.548
- Which was fantastic.
- Which was fucking fantastic.

02:50.637 --> 02:53.117
- That was inside, ma'am.
-Oh, that was inside.

02:53.607 --> 02:56.486
Ma'am. Ma'am, it's Amy.
She sounds uncomfortable.

02:56.543 --> 02:58.523
- Like she's with a member of the public.
- Okay.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.455
She's got one of the normals here.

03:00.614 --> 03:03.390
Okay, space?
We're not going to be dealing with space

03:03.483 --> 03:04.518
as an issue in the speech.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.495
Space is bold, but safe at the same time.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.555
There are no votes in space.
There's nothing there.

03:08.655 --> 03:11.397
- SELINA: <i>Hi, Ame, </i>
- I'm gonna pass you onto Alicia, ma'am.

03:11.491 --> 03:13.664
- Alicia?
- Alicia Keys?

03:13.727 --> 03:15.570
Alicia Bryce, that's right, ma'am!

03:15.662 --> 03:17.869
- She loves you.
- Oh, Alicia Bryce!

03:17.998 --> 03:20.308
- Oh.
- She's doing the Walk To The White House.

03:20.367 --> 03:23.007
I know, right.
She wants universal child care, right?

03:23.136 --> 03:25.548
- I know who she is.
<i>- Child care, exactly.</i>

03:25.639 --> 03:27.175
<i>Amy, put her on.</i>

03:28.141 --> 03:29.142
SELINA: <i>Alicia!</i>

03:29.209 --> 03:30.552
Hi!

03:31.144 --> 03:34.887
- Hi, Madam Vice President.
- How are you?

03:34.981 --> 03:37.587
SELINA: I just want you to know
that universal child care is something

03:37.684 --> 03:40.221
I'm going to be passionate about
in my campaign.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.493
And I can't wait to see you on the special day.

03:42.556 --> 03:46.094
Thank you so much for being a part of all of it.

03:46.193 --> 03:47.729
I'm very honored. Thank you.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.068
<i>Okay. Bye-bye-</i>

03:49.162 --> 03:50.163
(CHUCKLES)

03:50.664 --> 03:51.699
- Ma'am?
- Yeah.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.870
I'm in the middle of a lot of shit right now,
so I'm hanging up.

03:55.435 --> 03:57.506
Yeah, we are delighted, too!

03:58.371 --> 04:00.578
Ma'am. Child care?

04:00.674 --> 04:03.086
Children are of no value. Forget child care.

04:03.276 --> 04:05.381
SELINA: Children are vital, Kenny Rogers.

04:05.445 --> 04:07.584
We're not all planning to die alone like you.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.095
MIKE: <i>So, you excited to be here?</i>

04:13.220 --> 04:14.392
ALICIA: You bet!

04:14.454 --> 04:16.593
So if your girl makes president, you guys

04:16.690 --> 04:18.101
- double your pay, right?
- (SCOFFS)

04:18.190 --> 04:21.262
- I don't know. Do we, Amy?
- That's not how it works.

04:21.361 --> 04:23.739
The Vice President
is so happy that we found you, Alicia.

04:23.797 --> 04:27.404
Kent, this is Alicia Bryce,
the universal child care lady.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.605
- Hi.
- Sure.

04:30.971 --> 04:31.972
(GROANS)

04:32.072 --> 04:34.211
Whatever it is I'm selling, he is not buying.

04:34.307 --> 04:36.082
Don't worry,
he's like that with all the humans.

04:36.143 --> 04:38.054
No. He thinks you're great.
I'm just gonna remind him.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.146
Yeah. Please do, Ame.

04:39.246 --> 04:42.227
Mike, I've been waiting
for an hour for excerpts from the speech.

04:42.315 --> 04:44.056
Leon, today is a very high-pressure day,

04:44.117 --> 04:46.791
and as you know me,
I don't even like high-pressure showers.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.566
Is that what I've been smelling?
I thought maybe it was your panic.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.432
He's kidding. I shower, of course.

04:51.491 --> 04:54.995
And you like to use a lot of cologne.
Like a lot of cologne.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.598
- Axe Body Spray, right, Mike?
- Okay, guys?

04:57.664 --> 05:00.110
If we could put Mr. West
back in the press area

05:00.167 --> 05:01.908
and keep him there? Thank you.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.443
- Ms. Bryce?
- Mmm-hmm.

05:03.503 --> 05:05.176
- Sue Wilson.
- Oh.

05:05.272 --> 05:06.945
What does a red sticker mean?

05:07.007 --> 05:09.647
I'm like a target for snipers?

05:09.743 --> 05:12.690
It means you're wearing a red sticker.
Follow me, please.

05:13.413 --> 05:14.414
(MUMBLING)

05:14.481 --> 05:16.757
- Ma'am, I spoke to Senator Doyle earlier...
- Hi.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.660
...and he offered his input
on configuration of guests.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.130
Doyle? You're kidding me.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.361
I'd rather get advice
from a fucking Ouija board.

05:23.456 --> 05:25.629
- Sue, where's Catherine?
- She's late, ma'am.

05:25.692 --> 05:28.104
Yeah, she better have been in an accident.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.436
Dan, this rewrite kicks balls and ass.

05:30.530 --> 05:32.806
It explains me, it really articulates me.

05:32.866 --> 05:36.109
It's beautifully put together, like me.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.807
It's great. It's locked.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.851
- Oh, thank God.
- We just have a couple of tweaks.

05:39.940 --> 05:43.387
If you go to paragraph two on page one,
that's where you'll see my notes.

05:43.476 --> 05:45.217
I thought you just said it was locked.

05:45.312 --> 05:47.451
Yeah, it is. It's structurally very sound.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.551
We just need to nail the wording, okay?

05:51.017 --> 05:52.894
- Um, Ma'am.
- Yes?

05:53.019 --> 05:54.623
This Saturday Night Live shitstorm

05:54.688 --> 05:56.361
has just hit nine on the Sphincter Scale.

05:56.456 --> 05:58.402
- The sketch?
- Yeah. Three million hits.

05:58.491 --> 06:00.198
SELINA: Oh, those shit stains.

06:00.393 --> 06:03.033
- So what? I had a horse as a kid. Who didn't?
- Mmm...

06:03.129 --> 06:04.631
- I mean, have a pet is what I meant.
-Yeah.

06:04.731 --> 06:07.541
Well, ma'am, in your book,
you say that pony grooming

06:07.634 --> 06:09.978
taught you about how tough
it is for American farmers.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.482
- That's right, I did say that, 'cause it did.
- BEN: That's funny!

06:12.539 --> 06:14.815
- Why is that funny?
- I can't watch it. Did you see it?

06:14.908 --> 06:17.388
SELINA: No, I don't watch this show.
It's completely juvenile.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.516
(APPLAUSE ON TABLET)

06:19.579 --> 06:20.819
WOMAN: <i>What are you doing, honey?</i>

06:20.881 --> 06:23.725
<i>I'm learning how hard it is to be a farmer.</i>

06:23.917 --> 06:26.659
<i>It's really, really hard!</i>

06:27.254 --> 06:28.562
- Finished!
- (GIGGLES)

06:28.722 --> 06:31.225
It's like SNL is going back in time
and abusing a child.

06:31.324 --> 06:34.737
<i>I'm Selina Meyer, and I approve my pony.</i>

06:35.262 --> 06:38.607
Like I always say,
nothing less funny than a comedian.

06:38.698 --> 06:41.269
Ma'am, the thing to do in this situation
is you own it, all right.

06:41.368 --> 06:43.370
You go on the show, and you own it.

06:43.436 --> 06:44.847
SELINA: Are you kidding me, Dan?

06:44.938 --> 06:48.044
If somebody takes a shit in your car,
what are you gonna do?

06:48.108 --> 06:50.884
You gonna drop your trou
and take a crap through the sunroof?

06:50.944 --> 06:52.184
I don't think so, buddy.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.589
Get on the phone to SNL and fix this.

06:54.681 --> 06:58.094
- Ma'am, this has speech implications...
- Oh, please.

06:58.184 --> 07:00.528
Sue, can I impose myself
on your diagram over here?

07:00.587 --> 07:02.965
Come on over. Sue <i>casa es su casa,</i> sir.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.057
(LAUGHING)

07:05.191 --> 07:07.296
- SELINA: Wait a minute.
- That's funny, Sue.

07:07.394 --> 07:09.897
SELINA: What are you saying?
KENT: Well, thanks to <i>Saturday Night Live,</i>

07:09.963 --> 07:12.443
we need to take Disabled Farmer off the steps.

07:12.532 --> 07:14.307
- SELINA: No, we don't.
- You gotta take him out of the speech.

07:14.401 --> 07:15.436
- So, Dan, you gotta lose...
- Yup.

07:15.535 --> 07:18.379
So now we need to replace
Disabled Farmer with somebody else.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.748
- No, you're not going to replace him.
- DAN: Wait, shit, you know what?

07:20.807 --> 07:21.785
We can't lose the farmer. If we do that,

07:21.875 --> 07:23.877
then we gotta get rid of the
Sensitive New York Fitness Guy,

07:24.044 --> 07:26.456
and then we can't go metropolitan
if we're not gonna hit Middle America.

07:26.546 --> 07:28.492
- That's right.
- We need to rewrite the speech!

07:28.581 --> 07:30.822
I cant rewrite the rewrite, Kent.
I'm still writing it.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.761
That's the reality, Dan.
If you don't like the reality,

07:33.820 --> 07:36.323
go live in Oregon
and make quilts with my mother.

07:36.423 --> 07:37.424
She could use the help.

07:37.557 --> 07:40.128
Guys, guys, everything here is sacred.

07:40.660 --> 07:43.266
This is staying exactly the way it is.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.105
Okay? Exactly.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.974
For the first time in four years,

07:47.067 --> 07:48.774
I can say what I really think.

07:48.835 --> 07:51.975
You start picking this thing apart,
and what am I left as?

07:52.072 --> 07:56.282
Some sort of optimistic warmonger
with a soft spot for educated gays.

07:58.411 --> 07:59.981
What's the hold-up?

08:00.080 --> 08:02.151
President Lincoln should be back
from the theater by now.

08:02.248 --> 08:05.024
- Good things come to those who wait.
- Gimmie.

08:05.251 --> 08:08.095
Quit your yakkin',
'cause guess who's packin'!

08:08.188 --> 08:10.168
- Give me one of those.
- Legit journalists only.

08:10.256 --> 08:13.794
Yeah, not some pissant who narrowcasts
libelous poison from his mother's phone.

08:13.860 --> 08:16.636
Know what, Leon?
I'm the future of news media, so...

08:16.763 --> 08:19.437
- Mike, this is just a press release.
- No, it's not.

08:19.532 --> 08:22.308
Jonah' I'm going to have
your credentials checked, Jo-nad.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.006
Yeah, real professional, Mike.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.881
- Jo-nad! Jo-nad!
- I'll find my own.

08:28.441 --> 08:30.546
- Jo-nad! Jo-nad!
- ALICIA: Mike!

08:31.277 --> 08:33.347
- Hi. Is there someplace we're supposed to be?
- Uh, sorry.

08:33.446 --> 08:36.484
Sorry, yeah. Just yelling at the media.
Yes, yes, yes.

08:36.549 --> 08:39.894
- Um...
- Hey, Steps VIPs. You guys are an inspiration.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.530
- ALICIA: Thank you.
- Put your boss on the phone,

08:42.621 --> 08:45.626
or I will sauté your sack, you <i>SNL</i> shitstick.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.069
SUE: Red Stickers assemble!

08:47.160 --> 08:51.540
That was Sue. She says it's time
for you guys to become Steps Superstars!

08:51.631 --> 08:52.632
ALICIA: Yay!
SUE: Thank you.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.473
MAN: I need all Steps VIPs, please!

08:54.534 --> 08:56.036
That's you! You dared to dream.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.240
That's anyone with a red sticker!

08:57.337 --> 08:59.647
Are you ready? Come on. Here we go.

09:00.473 --> 09:01.508
(CHATTERING)

09:01.574 --> 09:04.214
Mike, half of America just came in.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.551
This is like Black Friday at Walmart.

09:07.647 --> 09:11.356
No, no, these people are filler,
you are killer. Seriously.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.989
You are a big... Gary, come here.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.658
I wanted you to meet Alicia.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.566
Alicia, hey, it's so nice to meet you!

09:18.658 --> 09:19.898
Ooh, you're VIP!

09:19.993 --> 09:22.030
I was just telling her how special she is.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.166
Like, who's this lady in the back row?
I don't even know her.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.834
Her? Just beat cancer.

09:25.999 --> 09:29.776
Yeah, but not a bad one.
An easy one, like finger or skin.

09:29.869 --> 09:31.041
Not one of the hard ones.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.674
Are they all as special as me?

09:32.772 --> 09:34.877
- No. No, no, no.
- No. Are you kidding?

09:34.941 --> 09:37.251
- This guy here is just an injured fireman.
- GARY: Yeah (CHUCKLES)

09:37.343 --> 09:39.084
I don't see any scars.

09:39.345 --> 09:43.122
I need Foster Mom and Heroic Restaurateur
to switch places, please.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.887
GARY: Heroic Restaurateur!

09:44.951 --> 09:47.022
"I just made an omelet, I'm a hero!"

09:47.220 --> 09:49.928
-(LAUGHING)
- ALICIA: Oh, uh, Halo has to pee.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.696
Hey, Amy, where are the chaperones?

09:51.791 --> 09:53.566
The St. Joseph's Children's Choir

09:53.626 --> 09:56.038
has come down with a vomiting bug.
All 30 of them.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.572
So the chaperones
are drowning in children at the moment.

09:58.731 --> 10:01.940
Um, I can take you,
I'm going that way anyway.

10:02.035 --> 10:04.379
So why don't you come with me?
Do I take her hand?

10:04.437 --> 10:07.577
- ALICIA: Yes, hold Miss Amy's hand.
- Amy was born to be with kids.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.911
- Well, peeing is fun!
- MIKE: There you go.

10:10.977 --> 10:14.288
- All right. This is my spot?
- Okay, are we ready?

10:14.547 --> 10:16.117
- (APPLAUSE)
- SELINA: How you all doing? Are you good?

10:16.616 --> 10:19.825
I feel good! Thank you all for being here.

10:19.919 --> 10:23.332
- You look like a pretty toy soldier.
- Okay, don't do a salute.

10:23.423 --> 10:26.961
- Ma'am, may I present your VIPs?
- Oh, Karen!

10:27.093 --> 10:30.404
Ma'am, I loved you on <i>Saturday Night Live.</i>
You were hysterical.

10:30.463 --> 10:34.343
That wasn't me, though.
But wasn't it funny? So funny!

10:34.434 --> 10:36.675
- This right here...
- SELINA: Alicia Bryce!

10:36.803 --> 10:39.147
- We get to meet each other at last!
- Yes!

10:39.239 --> 10:40.274
- She's the one who...
- Wonderful!

10:40.340 --> 10:42.513
I am passionate about universal child care.

10:42.609 --> 10:45.590
- Ma'am, I am so glad to talk to you.
- You should also know...

10:45.645 --> 10:48.990
- That's a little distracting.
- SELINA: Yeah, it is. It's distracting.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.426
- So distracting.
- SELINA: Yeah, so quit it.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.495
Ma'am, I didn't get a chance
to say on the phone,

10:53.586 --> 10:57.033
but 38% of our kids
have no regular child care arrangements.

10:57.123 --> 11:00.195
- 48%.
- Two out of every five kids.

11:00.293 --> 11:03.467
- 38%, right?
- 38%. That's it.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.709
- I'm glad you echo my concerns.
- No, I do. I do.

11:06.799 --> 11:08.005
I echo your concerns.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.775
I'm gonna see you soon, and that's 100%.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.617
Oh, well, you can repeat 100%
any time you like, ma'am.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.209
I will, ma'am. 100%!

11:16.109 --> 11:17.645
- (LAUGHING)
- Okay, where've you been?

11:18.611 --> 11:20.022
Okay, great pee!

11:20.113 --> 11:23.993
I wanna know who's responsible
for that sketch, you cocktail napkin.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.330
- Yeah, you heard me.
- Dan. Amy.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.456
- Shit, I gotta go.
- AMY: Senator Doyle.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.297
I have a meeting scheduled
with the Vice President right now

11:31.357 --> 11:33.997
and it is "right now' right now.

11:34.060 --> 11:37.337
- Dan, you take this, right now.
- DAN: What?

11:38.131 --> 11:40.338
No, I can't talk 'cause I'm on another call.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.971
DAN: You guys are an inspiration.
MIKE: No, not this one.

11:44.504 --> 11:47.678
Mike, I need Dee.
She's outside, I need her to watch Halo.

11:47.740 --> 11:49.310
No problem. I will get Dee.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.045
You okay, baby?

11:53.313 --> 11:56.021
Yeah, it's good, except
this orders wrong because

11:56.082 --> 11:58.153
you can't have hospital after military.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.696
But you wanted military first.

11:59.986 --> 12:04.196
Yeah, I know, but you can't have
hospitals after war. That's what I'm saying.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.998
'Cause then they sound like
they're the result of war.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.436
It's the curse of the unintended narrative.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.564
Okay, but you still want military first?

12:09.729 --> 12:10.833
Yes!

12:11.164 --> 12:13.166
Yeah, I'll just say them simultaneously.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.406
Like those Tibetan throat singers, Dan.

12:15.501 --> 12:17.708
Ma'am, you gotta dump
the universal child care.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.613
Jesus, Doyle, where did you just come from?

12:19.706 --> 12:22.084
Universal child care
is a bottomless money pit.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.746
You pledge this,
you can forget about having a navy.

12:24.844 --> 12:27.723
Okay, sweetheart.
Don't get your panties all up in a wad.

12:27.780 --> 12:30.693
I'm just mentioning Alicia Bryce by name.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.752
I am not appointing her
to my joint chiefs of staff.

12:32.852 --> 12:35.799
Do I look like I rode in
on the last fuck truck, Selina?

12:35.888 --> 12:38.562
- What's a fuck truck?
- You are smuggling in universal child care.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.796
You sound paranoid, okay?

12:40.893 --> 12:42.600
I'm mentioning child care. Thais it.

12:42.695 --> 12:46.404
Oh, so we can say anything now?
We can say we can heal the sick.

12:46.532 --> 12:48.273
We can turn water into blowjobs.

12:48.368 --> 12:51.315
- All right, we're done here.
- Look, Selina, play it safe.

12:51.404 --> 12:54.783
Put the AARP on those steps. Seniors vote.

12:54.874 --> 12:56.217
They've got nothing else to do.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.950
I've got a senior up there.
I'm looking right at him.

12:59.379 --> 13:02.155
- Okay?
- Well, maybe you don't have him.

13:02.248 --> 13:03.818
- SELINA: What?
- Excuse me, I gotta take this call.

13:03.916 --> 13:05.759
It's from a senior member

13:05.818 --> 13:08.890
of the party that you hope to lead.

13:09.088 --> 13:10.123
What do you want me to do?

13:10.223 --> 13:12.328
You want me to be just
some sort of a party puppet?

13:12.425 --> 13:15.269
You can stick
your hand up my ass and work my mouth?

13:15.328 --> 13:17.137
DOYLE: Yes, please!
SELINA: Gosh!

13:17.297 --> 13:18.776
What were you bobbleheads doing

13:18.831 --> 13:20.970
while I was just getting ear-fucked
by Father Time?

13:21.067 --> 13:22.910
- Senator Doyle is correct, ma'am.
- SELINA: No, he's not!

13:22.969 --> 13:25.575
The gray vote is a given,
but universal child care?

13:25.638 --> 13:27.242
That spooks the horses.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.115
Seniors are the easy vote.

13:29.175 --> 13:31.485
Child care is a principle.

13:31.577 --> 13:34.922
Ma'am, you have plenty of principles.
Just gotta pick another one.

13:35.415 --> 13:39.090
Oh, my gosh, I can't believe this!

13:40.820 --> 13:43.027
No, the Dee don't stand for anything.

13:43.122 --> 13:45.534
That's like me askin' you
what does the Mike stand for?

13:45.625 --> 13:47.161
It stands for "Mike kind of guy."

13:47.493 --> 13:50.167
- (CHUCKLES) You kind of lame.
- Uh, Mike?

13:50.430 --> 13:51.875
Honey, I dropped the kids?

13:51.964 --> 13:53.841
What? No, no.

13:53.933 --> 13:55.879
The chaperone said the choir will sing, Leon.

13:55.968 --> 13:59.108
No, universal child care.
Rumor has it Selina's dropping it.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.311
- Wait, what?
- Absolutely not.

14:01.374 --> 14:04.787
- It is a priority for the Vice President.
- Yeah, it better be.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.120
Who's the bulldog? New campaign manager?

14:07.180 --> 14:10.184
My name is Dee.
And you're what, fucking nobody?

14:10.283 --> 14:12.285
'Cause don't nobody
talk to Dee like that, okay?

14:12.352 --> 14:13.729
MIKE: Let's go, Dee.
That was a good put-down.

14:13.820 --> 14:14.992
It was okay.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.234
- Look here, you wrote, "All you who've."
- DAN: Yeah.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.903
Oh, Ma'am, SNL just e-mailed me back.

14:21.227 --> 14:24.071
- Crap in my lap.
- SELINA: What? What is it? What?

14:25.298 --> 14:26.743
They're gonna do another sketch.

14:28.334 --> 14:29.574
Wait a minute.

14:30.169 --> 14:32.649
They're gonna what?
Is this your doing?

14:32.739 --> 14:34.412
Did you give them this idea, Dan?

14:35.308 --> 14:39.484
I don't do offended,
but I am affronted that you'd even think that.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.546
Mmm.

14:41.981 --> 14:43.858
- Fucking comedians.
- Fucking comedians.

14:43.916 --> 14:44.894
SELINA: I'll tell you what happens.

14:44.984 --> 14:46.156
They get bullied when they're little at school,

14:46.219 --> 14:48.722
and then they perpetuate the cycle
by bullying me.

14:48.821 --> 14:49.822
I'm gonna take care of this.

14:49.889 --> 14:50.890
I'm gonna call those fucking nerds right now.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.333
Yeah. Get that done!

14:52.825 --> 14:55.203
Sorry I was late. I was giving that speech at...

14:55.328 --> 14:57.103
- Oh...
- Hey! (CHUCKLES)

14:57.196 --> 14:58.675
Great minds think alike!

14:58.831 --> 15:01.607
You look like you're in one of those
body-swap comedies.

15:02.335 --> 15:05.407
What in the wide world of fuck
do you think you're wearing?

15:06.005 --> 15:07.678
Nice to see you, too.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.842
I was trying to be conservative.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.253
You haven't dressed
like this since you were two and a half.

15:12.612 --> 15:15.092
This makes me look
like I'm some sort of a crazy person

15:15.181 --> 15:17.855
that was deliberately
trying to make us look like twins.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.591
- That's nuts!
- I'm not trying to make you look crazy.

15:20.686 --> 15:22.427
Well, then go and change this outfit.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.900
Seriously. This is ridiculous.

15:24.957 --> 15:26.368
Well, why don't you change?

15:27.360 --> 15:28.395
Huh?

15:28.461 --> 15:29.701
Is that a joke?

15:31.130 --> 15:32.200
Yes.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.405
This is my day.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.413
(CHUCKLES) I mean, you know?

15:39.205 --> 15:41.879
Ah. Cute. Li'l Selina.

15:41.974 --> 15:42.975
(CHUCKLES)

15:44.277 --> 15:46.780
I just got off the phone
with the congressional leadership

15:46.879 --> 15:48.881
and they're stuck in traffic,

15:48.948 --> 15:50.894
so we may not make it to the steps.

15:53.886 --> 15:55.229
You hear that?

15:56.155 --> 15:57.156
Um...

15:58.458 --> 15:59.766
Are you threatening me?

15:59.826 --> 16:02.636
No. Traffic is really bad,

16:02.728 --> 16:05.675
so the car might be stuck there forever.

16:05.765 --> 16:08.302
So I'm supposed to let a bunch

16:08.401 --> 16:10.847
of dead-eyed white guys

16:11.471 --> 16:15.442
shit all over absolutely everything
that I stand for.

16:16.442 --> 16:17.443
Huh?

16:17.944 --> 16:18.979
Mmm-mmm.

16:19.078 --> 16:21.615
I'm not going to let the party dictate to me.

16:21.747 --> 16:24.819
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:26.419 --> 16:29.025
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

16:29.255 --> 16:30.791
Shit!

16:31.991 --> 16:33.436
God!

16:37.430 --> 16:38.602
God!

16:46.005 --> 16:49.111
I've decided that I'm

16:49.175 --> 16:51.951
going to let them dictate to me.

16:52.278 --> 16:54.781
Because that is my decision.

16:54.881 --> 16:58.954
Do you understand that?
I am letting them do that!

16:59.018 --> 17:00.691
- Get it?
- Yes, ma'am.

17:00.786 --> 17:04.962
Right! But they do not own me!

17:05.491 --> 17:07.232
- They really don't, ma'am.
- No, they don't!

17:07.326 --> 17:10.068
No, they don't!

17:15.568 --> 17:17.205
So...

17:19.571 --> 17:21.643
We're losing child care?

17:22.808 --> 17:24.753
Replacing it with seniors?

17:26.000 --> 17:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here

17:37.356 --> 17:39.836
Okay, Benevolent Taxi Driver
should move to his left.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.496
MAN: Mr. Davis, can you
move to the left, please?

17:41.928 --> 17:45.000
- It's Miss Dee! My VIP!
- Excuse me, ma'am.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.737
Could you go back
to where you were standing?

17:46.832 --> 17:48.243
I'll be real fast.

17:48.334 --> 17:49.404
What's wrong with that lady's face?

17:49.502 --> 17:51.413
Looks like something
crawled up in there and died.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.745
- Mike, child care has been axed.
- MIKE: What?

17:53.839 --> 17:55.580
AMY: You need to dump Alicia, sensitively.

17:55.675 --> 17:56.949
MIKE: I can't! Amy!

17:59.679 --> 18:01.556
ALICIA: Yes, she's really, really into it.

18:02.515 --> 18:03.550
(SIGHS)

18:03.616 --> 18:04.754
ALICIA: What's wrong?

18:04.850 --> 18:06.921
- You look like you killed a hooker.
- No, I didn't. Um...

18:09.188 --> 18:12.294
This is slightly worse, Alicia.

18:12.391 --> 18:14.234
You may know what I'm about to say,

18:14.360 --> 18:16.033
so please feel free to say it.

18:16.228 --> 18:18.105
That way I don't really have to say it.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.110
Could I talk to Amy?

18:20.199 --> 18:21.576
Thank you. Yes. Amy?

18:21.634 --> 18:23.705
- Amy, Alicia requested...
- AMY: Not happening.

18:26.405 --> 18:28.885
Amy's on a phone and walking.

18:30.376 --> 18:32.049
We have to...

18:32.545 --> 18:34.456
We have to stand you down, Alicia,
for this event.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.288
We're not gonna need you.

18:36.382 --> 18:37.884
DEE: This is unbelievable.

18:37.950 --> 18:41.124
I know, and I apologize
if we have wasted your time.

18:41.253 --> 18:43.563
No, you ain't wasted nobody's time, 'cause
we gonna use that time

18:43.623 --> 18:44.931
- to kick your ass.
- Dee.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.631
I'm angry too, I wanna kick my own ass.
I'll do it for you.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.731
I've punched myself in the face before.
I ran into a wall once.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.969
- I wanna kick my own ass.
- Mike, I'm sick and tired of you, okay?

18:53.065 --> 18:55.170
The Vice President is going
to West Virginia next month

18:55.267 --> 18:57.144
to visit a kindergarten.
You could come with us!

18:57.236 --> 18:58.476
I'm not going to West Virginia!

18:58.571 --> 19:00.312
What do we look like going to any Virginia?

19:00.406 --> 19:01.976
I don't know who it's from,
but I have to take this call.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.144
- Mike McClintock...
- No, you are not taking it.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.779
I have to take this! I have to do this!

19:05.911 --> 19:08.915
(GRUNTS) I'm trying to help you,
you stupid cow!

19:12.918 --> 19:14.261
ALICIA: What did you just say?

19:15.254 --> 19:16.255
I...

19:16.756 --> 19:19.327
Where I grew up,
my dad called my mom a cow all the time.

19:19.425 --> 19:21.837
It's not bad, it's homey and friendly.

19:21.927 --> 19:23.804
"I love you, baby, you're a cow."

19:25.798 --> 19:29.211
Oh, my God, Mike.
What are you going to do for an encore?

19:29.301 --> 19:30.473
You gonna punch the kid?

19:30.536 --> 19:32.038
Alicia, you and I should talk.

19:32.138 --> 19:34.175
AMY: Out that door
before I nail your squawky throat to it.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.810
I can feel that air crackling between us, Amy.

19:37.143 --> 19:39.521
Oh. Hey, Leon, do you have any
idea what just happened in there?

19:39.612 --> 19:41.683
Amy, what is this bushel of fuck
talking about?

19:41.781 --> 19:44.694
Leon, would you mind smashing his head off
with a fire extinguisher?

19:44.784 --> 19:45.819
I wouldn't mind.

19:49.221 --> 19:50.791
She hasn't moved in five minutes.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.667
She must feel horrible.

19:52.958 --> 19:54.665
DAN: It's like her fucking head's
gonna spin around.

19:55.461 --> 19:58.203
Amy, what the fuck is happening?
Is Mike on crank?

19:58.297 --> 19:59.970
That's actually
the least of my worries right now.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.012
Your mom has gone quiet.

20:02.168 --> 20:03.169
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

20:06.205 --> 20:09.209
I see you found it, the Room of Regret.

20:09.408 --> 20:12.981
- I'm fucked, Ben. I'm fucked.
- Well, there's a remedy.

20:13.145 --> 20:14.886
It's an ancient technique

20:14.980 --> 20:19.759
that's been plied by loveable losers
since way back.

20:20.252 --> 20:21.230
It's called begging.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.390
- Beg?
- Yeah.

20:22.488 --> 20:24.161
Jonah, that fucking lowlife?

20:24.323 --> 20:27.566
That fucking lowlife? You gotta go lower!

20:28.094 --> 20:30.404
You gotta go lower than the lowest lowlife.

20:30.496 --> 20:32.271
You gotta dig and dig and dig

20:32.364 --> 20:35.402
until you get to the point
where you wish you were dead.

20:35.501 --> 20:37.344
Okay? And that's base camp.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.776
- I gotta beg.
- Yeah.

20:40.873 --> 20:43.911
Hey, this could help a little bit.
Why don't you take one of these?

20:44.009 --> 20:46.683
- What is it?
- I don't know, I found them in my desk.

20:49.115 --> 20:52.426
DAN: Is there any way to snap her out
of this <i>Diving Bell and Butterfly</i> shit?

20:52.518 --> 20:54.429
She should be rehearsing my speech by now.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.026
CATHERINE: How long
has she been like this?

20:58.090 --> 20:59.535
- GARY: Forever.
- 15 minutes.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.435
Okay.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.104
Wait. Come on...

21:04.764 --> 21:09.144
Okay. Your big day is a travesty.
All right, I get it.

21:09.235 --> 21:11.545
It's like my 21st birthday.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.083
Or my 18th birthday.

21:13.372 --> 21:16.046
Or every other birthday, okay?

21:16.108 --> 21:19.055
Your entire life
has been leading up to this moment.

21:19.211 --> 21:23.387
And as a result of that,
my entire life has been awful.

21:23.582 --> 21:25.323
Posing for Christmas cards,

21:25.417 --> 21:28.057
watching C-SPAN instead of Sesame Street,

21:28.154 --> 21:31.931
going to memorials of old Israeli men
that I've never even heard of.

21:32.324 --> 21:34.634
I have had a hard,

21:34.894 --> 21:37.101
lonely, miserable life.

21:37.263 --> 21:40.335
And the only thing
that is going to make it worthwhile

21:40.633 --> 21:44.979
is if I become the daughter
of the next President of the United States.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.515
So you need to go out there,

21:46.605 --> 21:49.779
and you need
to stop behaving like a little bitch.

21:51.744 --> 21:55.021
Okay, sweetie, I am not a bitch, but thanks.

21:55.114 --> 21:58.994
And that jacket doesn't work, by the way.
You look like a waiter.

21:59.852 --> 22:00.853
(GROANS)

22:00.953 --> 22:02.261
God damn it.

22:04.423 --> 22:05.993
CATHERINE: It's okay. I fixed her.

22:06.091 --> 22:08.435
- Jonah. J-Rock. J-Riggedy.
- Mmm-hmm.

22:08.494 --> 22:12.806
I'm asking you kindly to not run
the cow story, okay?

22:12.865 --> 22:14.867
I'm appealing to your better nature.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.207
Mike, I don't have one of those.

22:16.302 --> 22:18.680
Jonah, please. I'm begging you.
I'm begging you.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.273
Really? ll doesn't look like you're begging.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.216
Please, Jonah. I'm begging. Please.

22:22.308 --> 22:23.810
- Don't run with the story.
- Now we're begging.

22:23.876 --> 22:26.356
What do you want me to do? Juggle?
Do you want me to dance?

22:26.445 --> 22:29.187
Actually, you know what? Sing me a song.

22:29.315 --> 22:32.785
Just spin the ol' dial on Radio McClintock,
see what it lands on.

22:32.952 --> 22:34.056
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

22:34.386 --> 22:36.127
I don't know, <i>Goober Peas?</i>

22:37.056 --> 22:39.832
- I have no fucking idea what that is.
- It's an old Civil War song.

22:39.892 --> 22:40.893
- For real?
- Yeah.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.973
Perfect. It's like a history lesson. Hit me up.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.197
You want me to count you in?

22:44.296 --> 22:46.572
- No.
- Five, six, seven, eight...

beauty pageant of the nearly dead.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.546
Okay, everybody give me a smile and wave.

23:25.671 --> 23:26.615
- None of these.
- SELINA: Okay.

23:26.705 --> 23:28.446
- You okay, ma'am?
- I just need my speech.

23:28.540 --> 23:30.349
Good to have you back, ma'am.
The speech isn't ready yet.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.855
Just upload any draft, I'm going to wing it.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.358
Blah, blah, blah, I am running.

23:35.547 --> 23:37.754
And I wasn't kidding about that jacket.

23:37.950 --> 23:41.193
Okay, guys, this is not a drill.
Operation Lady POTUS is go.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.096
Amy, it's flashing. Why is that?

23:43.188 --> 23:45.190
Ma'am, sign off on the Steps Lineup.

23:45.291 --> 23:47.430
- We still have a gap.
- Just spread all these guys out

23:47.526 --> 23:49.437
and get rid of this guy.
He looks like Jeffrey Dahmer.

23:49.528 --> 23:51.439
- Dan, maybe today?
- DAN: Yeah. Sorry, one second.

23:51.530 --> 23:54.636
The Beltway is clear. Thank you, Selina.

23:54.733 --> 23:56.713
I'm glad there's no more traffic.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.443
- Yes, indeed.
- Silver is the new gold. Is that right?

23:59.538 --> 24:01.779
- Amen.
- AMY: Get off the damn phone, Dan.

24:01.874 --> 24:02.875

- Give this to me.
- DAN: Yeah, okay.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.991
Hi, it's Selina Meyer!

24:08.080 --> 24:09.115
AMY: Is it printing?

24:09.214 --> 24:12.058
It says "sub adder." What the fuck is that?

24:12.117 --> 24:15.098
Yeah, that sounds great! Yes, I will. Bye-bye.

24:15.421 --> 24:17.458
- Yeah, that's taken care of.
- They're gonna drop it?

24:17.556 --> 24:19.763
Yeah, after they do one more with me in it.

24:19.825 --> 24:21.270
I'm just gonna embrace it.

24:21.327 --> 24:22.806
What about taking a dump in your car?

24:23.595 --> 24:25.302
- You what?
- No, before...

24:25.397 --> 24:26.774
- Are we ready to go?
- Yeah.

24:26.832 --> 24:28.834
Great. Let's do it.

That was fantastic. Get up.

- That was really nice.
- Thank you, Jonah.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.410
MIKE: Thank you, I owe you one.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.750
- What do you owe me for?
- Because you're not gonna run it.

24:38.577 --> 24:40.818
(CHUCKLES) Mike, I'm
absolutely running the story.

24:41.113 --> 24:44.117
And now the Goober Peas and the begging,
that's all part of it.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.763
You forgot to say it was off the record.

24:47.186 --> 24:49.359

I might as well go home.

- Oh.

25:16.281 --> 25:18.022
I know what you're doing, Selina.

25:18.117 --> 25:23.066

if I mentioned her in my speech

as the face of the future?

- I think it's a good idea.
- Yes, fantastic!

25:39.872 --> 25:44.014
Do you think that we could borrow your coat,
just for the speech?

- Oh, my God. I would be so honored.
- SELINA: Great! We'll tweet it'

25:47.479 --> 25:49.550
