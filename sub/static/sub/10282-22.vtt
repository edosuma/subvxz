WEBVTT

00:04.938 --> 00:06.307
Previously on ER:

00:06.340 --> 00:08.342
What, you got Frank
to snoop on my ex?

00:08.376 --> 00:10.644
He robbed a market
outside Denver.

00:10.678 --> 00:11.645
A cashier got hurt.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.281
Failure to recall basic

00:13.314 --> 00:15.583
respiratory principles,
unsupervised umbilical lines

00:15.616 --> 00:17.451
in an infant
and a fatal air embolism?

00:17.485 --> 00:19.053
Wow.

00:19.087 --> 00:20.821
Don't sign this contract
unless you are sure

00:20.854 --> 00:22.690
this is what
you want to do.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.125
You from
Chicago?
Mm-hmm.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.226
Any relation to,
uh, Charlie Pratt?

00:25.259 --> 00:27.461
I don't know him.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.397
I'm moving
back to Africa.

00:29.430 --> 00:33.501
I'm not leaving without you
and I'm not living without you.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.136
I love you.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.577
KOVAC:
I rented a Ninja
movie for Alex.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.713
Maybe we can watch it
tonight when I get home.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.515
He's got a math test
in the morning.

00:47.548 --> 00:48.716
Hard to keep track.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.384
He's not talking
much lately.

00:50.418 --> 00:51.819
( sighs )

00:51.852 --> 00:55.523
Alex keeps asking when
he can visit his dad.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.525
You think that's
a good idea?

00:57.558 --> 00:58.726
He doesn't know.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.261
Steve keeps
telling him

01:00.294 --> 01:03.397
that he's got some
new job in Colorado.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.333
Sam, you've got
to tell Alex the truth.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.304
Steve promised
me that he would.

01:10.338 --> 01:12.673
Do you want me to tell him?

01:12.706 --> 01:14.642
CARTER:
Hey! Hey!

01:14.675 --> 01:16.544
Hey, can I get
a hand with this?

01:16.577 --> 01:18.446
Your farewell feast?

01:18.479 --> 01:21.749
Pizza and sodas. I think
I got off cheap.

01:21.782 --> 01:23.417
Africa, huh?

01:23.451 --> 01:25.553
That's where she is.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.488
I gotta go. I don't
have a baby-sitter.

01:27.521 --> 01:28.889
I'm sorry I'm gonna
miss your party.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.659
Take care of
yourself, Dr. Carter.

01:36.464 --> 01:37.631
Party?

01:37.665 --> 01:40.234
Shut up,
it's a surprise.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.772
I just can't believe
it's your last shift.

01:44.805 --> 01:47.441
Last 72 minutes, to be exact.

01:47.475 --> 01:48.576
But who's counting?

01:48.609 --> 01:50.311
Okay, come and get it!

01:50.344 --> 01:51.345
( groans )

01:51.379 --> 01:52.380
Carnivores...
All right.

01:52.413 --> 01:53.714
Veggies.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.583
11 years, all we get's
a few lousy pizzas?

01:55.616 --> 01:58.186
Yeah, man, I was getting
ready to get the search
and rescue team.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.787
I took a little detour
by the river.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.555
I wanted to see them turn on the
lights at the Wrigley Building.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.391
Yeah, must have been

02:03.424 --> 02:05.459
after you picked up the
pies, 'cause it's cold.

02:05.493 --> 02:07.728
Maybe you want
to re-think the pizza thing.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.297
Dr. Carter, we
have a resident

02:09.330 --> 02:10.731
for a fall on
outstretched hand?

02:10.764 --> 02:11.932
I'll take it.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.934
I'm Miss Fleming,
the school nurse.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.203
This is Janell.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.704
How'd this happen, Janell?

02:16.737 --> 02:18.539
Well, I tried to
spike the ball,

02:18.572 --> 02:19.573
and I got caught
in the net.

02:19.607 --> 02:20.608
Uh-huh.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.810
She's very energetic.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.212
Are they called "residents"

02:24.212 --> 02:25.613
because they live
in the hospital?

02:25.646 --> 02:27.481
And very curious.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.950
Is it true that people
can have face transplants?

02:29.983 --> 02:30.951
Yes, it is.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.221
In fact, I'm 80 years old.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.955
I got this
off a dead guy.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.457
Dr. Carter, I'm
leaving an 18 month old

02:36.490 --> 02:37.691
with febrile
seizure in Two.

02:37.725 --> 02:39.227
Yeah, give it
to Abby or Neela.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.528
Okay.

02:40.561 --> 02:41.862
Still post-ictal but
temp's coming down.

02:41.895 --> 02:42.896
You get a CT?

02:42.930 --> 02:43.931
No history of trauma.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.366
LP?

02:45.399 --> 02:46.800
The kid's got a URI,
no meningismus.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.236
Oh, so you
figured out

02:48.269 --> 02:49.403
a way to evaluate
meningismus

02:49.437 --> 02:50.504
in toddlers?
Congratulations.

02:50.538 --> 02:51.539
How long's the
kid been here?

02:51.572 --> 02:52.640
Half an hour.

02:52.673 --> 02:53.841
LP's not
strictly indicated,

02:53.874 --> 02:55.276
but if he's not
back to baseline

02:55.309 --> 02:56.877
in an hour, we
get it anyway.
Good.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.412
And don't look now,
but the next set

02:58.446 --> 02:59.480
of victims is
on their way.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.781
Exam Room Three.
Trauma One

03:00.814 --> 03:02.250
and Trauma Two
over there.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.252
Computer hacker
with a paronychia

03:04.285 --> 03:05.853
needs a quick
I and D in Exam Two,

03:05.886 --> 03:07.255
but since
my shift's not over

03:07.255 --> 03:08.322
for another
six more minutes,

03:08.356 --> 03:09.857
I guess I'll
handle it myself.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.959
Come on, what's
a little cuticle
pus between friends?

03:11.992 --> 03:13.761
You guys gotta learn to
get each other's backs.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.796
Exam Two. Paronychia.
I and D.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.431
I'll get your next
prolapsed rectum.

03:17.465 --> 03:18.999
You're a peach.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.369
Ray, Cubs game starts in an
hour. Wanna grab a beer?

03:21.402 --> 03:22.970
I'm sorry, Chief,
but my buddy's

03:23.003 --> 03:24.272
having a party,
and I promised him

03:24.272 --> 03:25.606
I'd be there.
Sounds good.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.475
Meet you
in front.
What?

03:27.508 --> 03:28.942
We'll stop by my place on
the way so I can change.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.945
PRATT:
And if you look here,
this is the Admit area.

03:31.979 --> 03:35.549
I want you to take a look at
these sad and tired faces.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.551
See, you're the
"before" pictures,

03:37.585 --> 03:39.620
and I want you to
meet the "after."

03:39.653 --> 03:40.654
Trying to frighten them?

03:40.688 --> 03:41.855
Jane,
congratulations.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.024
Yeah, I was really
counting on Bellevue.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.559
Nice to see you
again, Abby.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.995
Uh, I'm sorry.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.463
I trailed you for a few days

03:49.497 --> 03:51.732
during my third year.
Jim Babinski.

03:51.765 --> 03:52.733
As in the
Babinski reflex?

03:52.766 --> 03:53.767
Cool. Any relation?

03:53.801 --> 03:55.303
Nope. None at all.

03:55.303 --> 03:56.570
I'm gonna go get
them some lockers

03:56.604 --> 03:58.839
and then let them tail
you guys around.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.841
Finally getting
the long coats, huh?

04:00.874 --> 04:02.876
Pretty thrilling.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.378
MAN:
I don't want to!

04:04.412 --> 04:05.846
All right, here we go.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.315
Lesson number one--
floor control.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.482
Sir! Sir, you're
going to have

04:08.516 --> 04:09.917
to get back
on the gurney.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.885
Come on!
Are we really about
to become R2's?

04:11.919 --> 04:12.986
All right, calm down.
Take it easy. Relax,
relax. Come on.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.755
No turning back now.

04:14.788 --> 04:17.524
My contract is signed
and sealed on Lewis's desk.

04:17.558 --> 04:18.926
Mine, too.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.861
Yeah, I got some things
to think about.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.396
Like what?

04:24.097 --> 04:25.499
Susan was just
pushing you, Ray.

04:25.533 --> 04:26.934
Don't let it
get to you.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.637
I don't know,
maybe she was right.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.606
Maybe it's time for
me to make a change.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.442
PRATT:
Get back on the gurney.

04:34.475 --> 04:35.676
( patient grunting )

04:35.709 --> 04:36.677
Leave me alone!

04:39.513 --> 04:41.649
Hey! Get off!

04:41.682 --> 04:43.083
Take it easy!
Calm down!

04:43.116 --> 04:44.618
Lucky for us...

04:44.652 --> 04:46.019
interns bounce.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:38.806 --> 05:40.674
What do you mean,
I might not have any fun?

05:40.708 --> 05:42.042
I'm just saying, you're
not gonna know anybody.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.011
You never know--
I'm into the music scene.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.479
Gigs, demos, whatnot.

05:45.513 --> 05:46.480
How's it going, guys?

05:46.514 --> 05:47.481
All good.

05:47.515 --> 05:48.482
Is Nick around?

05:48.516 --> 05:50.418
Try the penthouse.

05:50.451 --> 05:54.622
( music playing )

05:54.655 --> 05:56.089
MORRIS:
Good to get out once
in a while, isn't it?

05:56.123 --> 05:59.760
Forget about the daily
responsibility we carry

05:59.793 --> 06:03.163
as healers and just
mingle with regular people.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.466
Okay, listen--
don't talk like that.

06:05.499 --> 06:06.467
What, like a doctor?

06:06.500 --> 06:07.768
Like a bonehead.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.169
I wouldn't want
to see you getting bounced

06:09.202 --> 06:11.472
down all these stairs
by a bunch of my pals.

06:11.505 --> 06:14.074
Duly noted.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.809
Hey, Riles, what's up?

06:15.843 --> 06:16.977
What's up?
Make yourself
at home, bro.

06:17.010 --> 06:17.978
Beer upstairs?

06:18.011 --> 06:19.647
Yeah. Catch me later.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.014
This is about me
being chief, isn't it?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.015
What?

06:22.049 --> 06:23.116
You're a little bitter.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.652
Morris, I
couldn't care less.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.520
I've been meaning to
talk to you about that.

06:26.554 --> 06:27.521
What?

06:27.555 --> 06:28.656
Your lack of initiative.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.824
( sighs )

06:30.858 --> 06:31.859
Yo, Barnett!

06:31.892 --> 06:32.993
Hey, hey.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.194
What's up?!
What's up, man?

06:34.227 --> 06:36.864
How's it hanging?

06:36.897 --> 06:39.967
Uh, this is Archie.
We work together.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.569
I thought you were gonna
bring the roomie.

06:41.602 --> 06:42.703
Neela had to work.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.071
Is Jessica here?

06:44.104 --> 06:45.506
Yeah, she is.

06:45.539 --> 06:48.542
*

06:48.576 --> 06:49.677
So you're
a doctor too?

06:49.710 --> 06:50.844
Well, chief resident.

06:50.878 --> 06:54.815
Wow. That means,
like, nothing to me.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.786
Hey, Vanessa!

06:58.819 --> 07:00.220
Nice meeting you.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.623
( music playing )

07:08.929 --> 07:10.598
Okay, Mr. Enriquez.

07:10.631 --> 07:11.999
Are you gonna
crack his chest?

07:12.032 --> 07:14.635
That feels like
a ganglion cyst.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.670
What's "ganglion" mean?

07:16.704 --> 07:19.006
Have you had any luck
finding her parents?

07:19.039 --> 07:21.241
She was supposed to be
at a friend's house tonight.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.544
They're stuck out
on a lake cruise.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.879
They wanted
a romantic night out,

07:25.913 --> 07:27.214
just the two of them.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.551
I bet they did.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.252
So? Can you fix it?

07:32.285 --> 07:37.024
Well, unless it bothers you,
I would avoid the surgery.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.226
Most of the time, these things
turn out to be benign.

07:39.259 --> 07:40.628
If you say so.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.095
What's "benign" mean?

07:42.129 --> 07:44.231
Janell, stop
bothering the doctor.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.900
Who says I'm
bothering him?

07:46.934 --> 07:48.135
Dr. Carter. Just got a call

07:48.168 --> 07:49.570
from Building Services.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.138
The sewer pipes they
fixed last week?

07:51.171 --> 07:52.239
They're broken again.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.941
So, we only
have one O.R. open.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.043
All right. Let's watch
the trauma traffic,

07:56.076 --> 07:58.579
and try not to
get overextended.

07:58.612 --> 07:59.913
Break out the buckets.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.582
Chuny, is Curtain Two clear?

08:01.615 --> 08:02.650
Pick a bed, any bed.

08:02.683 --> 08:03.684
32-year old actor,

08:03.717 --> 08:05.052
smacked by
falling scenery.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.187
Now, are you a bull cow,
or are you for milking?

08:07.220 --> 08:08.722
The bleeding won't stop.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.924
Should have been wearing
your headpiece there.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.059
I was, it broke.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.927
A and 0 times
four, no LOC.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.162
All right.
Neela, you
got that?

08:15.195 --> 08:16.163
Good thing
I'm not Hindu.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.798
37-year-old male,
abrasions

08:17.831 --> 08:19.933
and first-degree burns
to the torso and extremities.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.068
What's all this about?

08:21.101 --> 08:22.603
Community theater
gone bad.

08:22.636 --> 08:23.637
It's an Equity showcase.

08:23.671 --> 08:24.972
Excuse me?

08:25.005 --> 08:26.073
We're mounting
an original musical

08:26.106 --> 08:28.075
about the great
Chicago fire.

08:28.108 --> 08:31.612
I had a little tiff with Mrs.
O'Leary's fat cow over there.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.145
Learn the
blocking,
you clod!

08:33.179 --> 08:34.815
Listen for your
cue, Elsie!

08:34.847 --> 08:36.183
I'd say you definitely
have this.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.585
I love the theater.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.154
And where might
you two be going?

08:41.188 --> 08:42.623
To get some
coffee.
Ambulance run.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.892
Dr. Carter, asthmatic
in Three is waking up.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.093
Hey, Tony,
you seen KJ?

08:46.126 --> 08:47.761
Who?
The Volunteen kid
I hooked up.

08:47.795 --> 08:49.296
Oh, yeah, Nurse's desk.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.098
All right.
Hey, man.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.633
It's not gonna be the
same without you.

08:52.666 --> 08:53.901
Oh, you'll survive.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.636
See you at the party?

08:55.669 --> 08:57.104
Party?

08:57.137 --> 08:59.039
I don't know anything
about any parties.

09:00.808 --> 09:01.909
Hey.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.310
Finish breaking down
those charts?

09:03.343 --> 09:06.113
Yeah, I took yellows
back to Medical Records

09:06.146 --> 09:07.314
like you told me.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.716
Good. It's after 8:00.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.117
What are you
still doing here?

09:10.150 --> 09:11.752
Waiting on my dad.
He's late.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.053
Did he say how late
he's gonna be?

09:16.023 --> 09:17.791
You have anybody
that can take you home?

09:17.825 --> 09:19.860
No, but he'll show, though.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.131
All right, come on.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.265
I'll take you home.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.668
First I gotta hit this party.

09:27.701 --> 09:28.969
What party?

09:29.002 --> 09:30.671
Check it out.
Huh? Huh?

09:30.704 --> 09:31.839
Music notes?

09:31.872 --> 09:33.707
No, man.

09:33.741 --> 09:37.010
Try the opening guitar
licks to "Free Bird."

09:37.044 --> 09:40.313
( singing guitar riff )

09:40.347 --> 09:42.349
Oh, Benny, we got it.

09:42.382 --> 09:45.085
You had a hep B shot
lately? I mean, the tat's

09:45.118 --> 09:46.253
really red around
the edges.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.888
You might want
to keep an eye on that.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.690
Oh, my God!

09:49.723 --> 09:53.961
Doc Barnett talking
the talk, man! You!

09:53.994 --> 09:55.028
You're a doctor?

09:55.062 --> 09:57.164
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.

09:57.197 --> 10:00.033
That's really cool.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.168
Yeah?

10:01.201 --> 10:04.337
Then, yes, I'm a doctor.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.173
Got anything for heartburn?

10:06.206 --> 10:08.308
No, man. How about
some mellowing agents?

10:08.341 --> 10:12.713
Man, there is mellowing agents
all over this place, okay?

10:12.746 --> 10:13.914
It's kinda hot in here.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.116
Wanna go get a drink?

10:16.149 --> 10:17.417
Sure.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.652
Okay.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.423
Uh-oh.

10:23.456 --> 10:28.028
*

10:28.061 --> 10:29.730
I thought you
were a musician.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.733
Oh, medicine's the way
I pay the music bills.

10:32.766 --> 10:33.801
Ahh...

10:33.834 --> 10:35.135
( man howls )

10:35.168 --> 10:36.737
Hello up there!
Beer here!

10:36.770 --> 10:38.371
Yo!

10:38.405 --> 10:40.073
What's up?

10:40.107 --> 10:42.075
Toss us down another
couple of brews, bro.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.043
All right.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.316
You ready?

10:49.349 --> 10:51.018
( grunting )

10:55.255 --> 10:56.890
( laughing )

11:00.127 --> 11:02.095
So, how's the double
life treating you?

11:02.129 --> 11:05.398
Well, some days are
better than others.

11:05.432 --> 11:06.834
That's interesting.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.769
Hey, any more
Jagermeister around?

11:08.802 --> 11:10.237
Uh... try inside.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.105
Hey. Archie.

11:12.139 --> 11:15.743
Yeah, I introduced you
two ten minutes ago.

11:15.776 --> 11:16.744
Oh.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.949
Is that guy
really your boss?

11:21.982 --> 11:23.116
Huh?

11:23.150 --> 11:25.252
That's what
he's been saying.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.755
MAN:
I hadn't even kicked over
the lantern yet.

11:27.788 --> 11:28.789
You missed your cue

11:28.822 --> 11:30.157
on account of
all that mooing.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.325
10ccs of lido and 5-O
on a needle driver, please.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.094
I'm doing the job
of two actors.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.063
And giving half a good
performance, assboy.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.264
Son of a bitch!

11:37.297 --> 11:38.465
Unless you'd like
a saline shower,

11:38.498 --> 11:40.000
keep your head still.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.401
LOCKHART:
How'd you get these burns?

11:41.434 --> 11:43.403
It must have been
the light stand.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.272
I'm not gonna be
scarred, am I?

11:45.305 --> 11:46.974
Nothing too serious.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.809
Hey, Abby, got a minute?

11:48.842 --> 11:50.010
Sure.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.311
Because I usually
play leads.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.146
600 of ibuprofen
and silvadene dressing.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.247
I use my body

11:54.281 --> 11:56.817
a lot as an actor.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.218
You mean, like
in pornos?

11:58.251 --> 11:59.286
You've seen my work?

11:59.319 --> 12:00.921
What an idiot.

12:00.954 --> 12:03.156
Okay, I'll be right back.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.525
What do you need?

12:05.558 --> 12:07.294
There's a bunch
of people waiting at Ike's,

12:07.327 --> 12:08.495
so I thought I'd
walk Carter over.

12:08.528 --> 12:09.496
You guys are good?

12:09.529 --> 12:10.530
Are we taking traumas?

12:10.563 --> 12:11.999
The pipes
won't be fixed

12:12.032 --> 12:14.034
for three or four hours,
so not till then.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.103
Okay. And I'd like
to get over there

12:16.136 --> 12:17.237
at some point, too.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.305
We'll rotate.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.840
I'll be back
in half an hour.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.374
You ready to go
to my surprise party?

12:21.408 --> 12:22.409
Yup.

12:22.442 --> 12:23.443
( television playing )

12:23.476 --> 12:24.444
Hey there.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.179
ALEX:
Hey.

12:26.213 --> 12:28.048
Did you check your sugar
before dinner?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.049
Ninety-two.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.251
That's good.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.886
Did Erica help you
with your math?

12:32.920 --> 12:34.387
Yeah.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.557
Did you remember to tell her
to pick you up tomorrow?

12:37.590 --> 12:40.493
No.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.329
Are you done
with your homework?

12:42.362 --> 12:44.297
I'm doing it.

12:44.331 --> 12:47.134
Looks like you're
watching TV to me.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.136
( hip-hop music playing )

12:52.873 --> 12:53.974
( music stops )

12:54.007 --> 12:55.876
You got a letter from your dad.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.350
As soon as
you finish studying.

13:03.383 --> 13:04.417
Mom...

13:04.451 --> 13:05.853
Alex.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.220
It's my mail.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.388
My rules.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.058
You're such a...

13:11.091 --> 13:13.426
Excuse me?

13:13.460 --> 13:15.362
Where's Luka?

13:15.395 --> 13:18.365
He's at work.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.433
Are you still fighting?

13:21.568 --> 13:23.403
No.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.276
We're going to have
to move again, aren't we?

13:34.447 --> 13:37.384
Yeah, I'm bringing him
right now.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.451
Okay. Right.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.520
What was that about?

13:40.553 --> 13:43.123
Just telling them
to be ready.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.391
Act surprised.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.059
I'll act surprised.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.263
GROUP:
Surprise!

13:50.297 --> 13:51.564
( laughing )

13:51.598 --> 13:53.400
You guys, you got me!

13:57.004 --> 13:58.939
KYLE:
Ray.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.407
NICK:
Who wants a burger?

14:00.440 --> 14:03.476
Yo, Ray, Your boy's
hurling in here, man.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.379
Stay here, okay?

14:06.413 --> 14:07.915
I won't move.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.082
All right.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.420
He almost made it
to the bathroom.

14:13.453 --> 14:14.654
Hey, sweetie, you okay?

14:14.687 --> 14:16.356
Yeah. You going
to come out here?

14:16.389 --> 14:17.925
Yeah, one second.

14:17.925 --> 14:20.360
Let me just finish
talking to these guys, huh?

14:20.393 --> 14:22.629
*

14:22.662 --> 14:23.931
( groaning )

14:23.964 --> 14:26.099
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

14:26.133 --> 14:29.536
Easy, easy.
Stupid, stupid.

14:29.569 --> 14:30.938
( sighs )

14:32.572 --> 14:34.441
Hi.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.244
You know, I admire you, Ray.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.479
You're one of those guys

14:39.512 --> 14:42.515
who just glide over
every speed bump.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.517
It all comes so easy.

14:44.551 --> 14:49.156
But me... people don't
expect much from me.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.058
Most of the time,
I prove them right.

14:51.091 --> 14:55.628
I guess that's why
I wanted chief, you know.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.464
Show 'em I could do it.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.400
Look, it's not
so easy for me either.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.970
I-/////!m just pretty good
at faking it.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.471
Yeah.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.607
Oh, my God.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.243
( retching )
I'll go get you some water.

15:10.277 --> 15:13.380
I swear to God,
that's what
she said.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.547
Get out of here.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.715
Hey, he okay?

15:15.748 --> 15:18.051
He gets excited.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.286
Hey, Ray!

15:19.319 --> 15:20.487
Find me some aspirin, too?

15:20.520 --> 15:22.389
( sighs )

15:22.422 --> 15:23.623
Sure thing.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.335
Molly!

15:38.038 --> 15:39.572
( whimpering ):
Ray...?

15:41.208 --> 15:42.175
Ray!

15:42.209 --> 15:44.011
No!

15:45.112 --> 15:46.579
No!

15:54.321 --> 15:56.023
( victims yelling and groaning )

15:56.023 --> 15:57.224
WOMAN:
Call 911.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.725
Okay, call 911!

15:58.758 --> 16:00.327
We've got at least
20 people injured here.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.262
Oh, man.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.696
KYLE:
Molly, where are you, baby?!

16:03.730 --> 16:06.666
Molly?!

16:07.800 --> 16:11.104
( groaning )

16:11.138 --> 16:13.573
Jess, Jess, I got you.
I got you.

16:13.606 --> 16:14.607
You all right?

16:14.641 --> 16:15.642
I'm burning...

16:15.675 --> 16:17.177
You breathing okay?

16:17.210 --> 16:18.278
Yeah.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.479
Molly?!

16:21.748 --> 16:22.782
Hey, over here,
this kid's stuck!

16:22.815 --> 16:25.518
You, you, get over here.

16:25.552 --> 16:26.653
Stay with her, okay?

16:29.489 --> 16:30.623
Help me!
Somebody help me!

16:30.657 --> 16:32.359
The ambulances are on their way.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.227
Stay with her.
Don't move her.

16:34.261 --> 16:35.695
If she passes out,
come and get me.

16:35.728 --> 16:38.731
No, Ray, don't go!
I'll be back.

16:38.765 --> 16:41.468
Ray, man, stop that! Get over
here, and help me get him out!

16:41.501 --> 16:43.570
( victims groaning )

16:43.603 --> 16:44.804
Talk to me, Molly.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.573
Come on, baby,
keep talking to me.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.441
WOMAN:
My friend's hurt.
Help me get her
to my car!

16:48.475 --> 16:51.111
Okay, everybody, stop. Stop!

16:51.144 --> 16:52.479
Shh, shh...

16:52.512 --> 16:53.780
I'm a doctor, okay?

16:53.813 --> 16:55.582
The paramedics
are on their way.

16:55.615 --> 16:56.783
So what we need to do
in the meantime,

16:56.816 --> 16:58.285
is just clear out
all this crap

16:58.318 --> 16:59.519
and uncover as many
bodies as we can,

16:59.552 --> 17:01.454
but nobody move anybody

17:01.488 --> 17:03.756
until I get
to check them over first, okay?

17:06.193 --> 17:07.160
Is the cow all fixed up?

17:07.194 --> 17:08.161
Both ends.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.329
May they go now?

17:09.362 --> 17:10.797
I'll be with you
in a moment, sir.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.401
He's here for the actors.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.137
It's his play
they ruined.
Oh.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.405
MAN:
My stage manager
is filling in.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.107
Horrid.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.308
But if I can get
them back in time,

17:21.340 --> 17:22.541
I might still have
a second act.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.777
I doubt these guys
are up for it.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.646
They're professionals.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.481
You know--
"the show must go on."

17:28.515 --> 17:32.285
Yeah. Why is that exactly?

17:32.319 --> 17:35.355
I mean, why can't the show
just stop once in awhile?

17:38.158 --> 17:39.159
Keep the pressure
going, okay?

17:39.192 --> 17:40.360
Stay here. Don't move.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.830
Tachy at 120.
Pulse is weak and thready.

17:43.863 --> 17:46.133
It hurts when I breathe.
All right, all right.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.734
Yeah. Breath sounds
are on the bad side.

17:47.767 --> 17:48.768
So no tension pneumo?

17:48.801 --> 17:50.237
Paramedics to him first.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.871
He needs two liters
of saline ASAP.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.740
Ray. Please.
Just another sec, okay?

17:53.773 --> 17:55.708
Jess, you're okay.
You're okay.

17:55.742 --> 17:56.843
Ray!

17:56.876 --> 17:58.845
They're coming, man.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.313
( groaning )
Keep tight.

18:00.347 --> 18:01.714
Ray, come here, man.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.683
I think she cut her ear, man.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.252
Okay, well, that's
one possibility.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.320
Molly? Molly?
Follow my finger.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.156
You got a headache?

18:09.189 --> 18:10.457
I feel okay.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.625
How many weeks are you?

18:12.659 --> 18:14.161
38. Is the baby okay?

18:21.401 --> 18:22.635
Benny?

18:32.912 --> 18:35.515
Can I have it now?

18:35.548 --> 18:37.284
On the table.

18:42.689 --> 18:43.690
Mom...

18:43.723 --> 18:45.392
Hmm?

18:45.425 --> 18:47.694
Are we ever going
to live with Dad again?

18:47.727 --> 18:48.828
Alex.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.730
He's got
a good job now.

18:50.763 --> 18:53.933
He's a river guide.
It's cool.

18:53.966 --> 18:58.371
We're not going to live
with your dad.

18:58.405 --> 19:01.708
Hey, I got you those
marshmallow cookies.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.743
I want to go
read my letter.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.383
( groaning )

19:10.417 --> 19:11.618
Easy, Nick. We're going
to get you fixed up.

19:11.651 --> 19:12.952
Four of MS and monitor
the foot pulses.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.954
All right, we got at least four
other criticals,

19:14.987 --> 19:16.523
and I'm not sure
who's still under there.

19:16.556 --> 19:17.924
Loading the pregnant lady
and chest pain.

19:17.957 --> 19:19.259
Working on the
impaled girl.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.393
Okay.
What else?

19:20.427 --> 19:22.795
Okay. We got
six dead over there.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.731
Plus about another
15 non-criticals,

19:24.764 --> 19:26.299
fractures and contusions.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.334
We were only eight minutes
behind the call.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.935
Yeah?

19:28.968 --> 19:31.371
You assessed over
25 patients in
eight minutes?

19:31.404 --> 19:32.505
There's no paperwork
out here.

19:32.539 --> 19:33.706
Morris is with
you, right?

19:33.740 --> 19:34.907
Yeah. Send him
to Saint Rafe's.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.343
He needs a banana bag.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.544
No, we'll send
the criticals there.

19:37.577 --> 19:38.678
The rest can go on
to Lakeview.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.413
Saint Rafe's?
Why not County?

19:40.447 --> 19:42.349
You guys closed to trauma.
Got the call an hour ago.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.284
Whoa, this is
a level one.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.586
St. Rafe's can't possibly take
care of the patients like we can

19:46.619 --> 19:48.488
Well, if you can get County
to open, all the better.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.257
It's a lot closer.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.727
County General on two bravo.

19:54.761 --> 19:57.864
Ray?
You're with Rescue 56?

19:57.897 --> 19:59.432
Our Ray?

19:59.466 --> 20:02.335
No, she's not here.
Him either.

20:02.369 --> 20:03.636
We got Abby.

20:03.670 --> 20:04.671
Thanks.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.408
Ray, what's going on?

20:08.441 --> 20:09.576
Porch collapse.
Lots of wounded.

20:09.609 --> 20:10.810
Five criticals.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.412
We need you to open up
right now.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.281
No, we only have
one working O.R.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.482
They won't all need the O.R.

20:15.515 --> 20:16.883
It's mostly blunt trauma.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.785
Okay, we can
accept one critical.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.720
Come on, Abby.
Take all five.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.989
No. No, we're understaffed here.

20:23.022 --> 20:24.491
They might not make it
anywhere else.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.359
Ray, we don't have
any attendings.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.827
Abby, you're a doctor.
You can do this.

20:27.860 --> 20:30.630
No. No, I'd have to run it
by Kovac.

20:30.663 --> 20:31.964
There isn't any time.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.733
CPR guy's flat-lined.

20:33.766 --> 20:36.336
Okay, we are down
to four criticals.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.570
Ray, I can't...

20:37.604 --> 20:39.572
Come on, County General.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.541
Will you accept these patients?

20:41.574 --> 20:43.976
Abby, you're being
recorded, you know.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.479
I know.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.721
Rescue 56, we're taking
four trauma patients.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.056
You have blanket orders
for IVs, c-spine and O-2.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.558
Thank you, County.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.693
We're four minutes out.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.498
Okay...

21:05.532 --> 21:07.033
Okay, let's get patients
out of trauma,

21:07.066 --> 21:08.735
sutures and curtain two.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.637
Jerry, call the O.R., tell them
to set up another room.

21:10.670 --> 21:13.072
Chuny, page Kovac.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.841
KOVAC:
Okay, listen up.

21:17.844 --> 21:20.012
Okay, first of all--

21:20.046 --> 21:22.014
you should all
eat and drink well,

21:22.048 --> 21:23.850
because the party's on Weaver.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.818
That is a surprise.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.354
If you guys are still on duty,

21:27.354 --> 21:28.355
don't let me see
a beer in your hand.

21:28.355 --> 21:29.756
Hey, 11 years.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.658
Couldn't we spring
for some caviar for the man?

21:31.691 --> 21:34.394
Anyway, uh...

21:34.427 --> 21:37.730
There's something
my father would say

21:37.764 --> 21:40.066
when... when a friend went
on a journey.

21:41.768 --> 21:44.036
And, uh...

21:44.070 --> 21:46.873
he said it to me
when I came to the
United States first.

21:46.906 --> 21:52.011
So I thought of it today
when I realized

21:52.044 --> 21:55.582
I wouldn't be working
with this guy anymore.

21:55.615 --> 21:57.950
Not for a long time at least.

21:57.984 --> 22:01.854
Uh...

22:01.888 --> 22:04.724
My father would, uh...

22:04.757 --> 22:07.927
clasp the person's hand,

22:07.960 --> 22:09.729
and say, uh...

22:12.499 --> 22:15.034
"We only part to meet again."

22:18.438 --> 22:19.806
Here, here.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.774
Yeah!
( applause )

22:24.944 --> 22:27.146
Cheers.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.415
Cheers, everybody.

22:28.448 --> 22:29.716
To Carter.
Cheers.
Cheers.

22:29.749 --> 22:31.784
To the doc.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.686
Burst eardrum, no battle sign.

22:33.720 --> 22:34.687
When's her due date?

22:34.721 --> 22:35.688
May 29.

22:35.722 --> 22:36.956
Tachy at 128 after a liter.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.124
Systolic's only 84.

22:38.157 --> 22:39.759
All right, get her
on her side.

22:39.792 --> 22:41.160
One, two...
What are you doing?

22:41.193 --> 22:42.161
Yeah, I have
the same question.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.096
Supine hypotension syndrome.

22:44.130 --> 22:46.666
Uterus compresses the vena cava,
reducing cardiac output.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.935
We're helping to get
her blood pressure back up.
( groans )

22:48.968 --> 22:50.570
You're okay, Molly,
we've got you.

22:50.603 --> 22:51.738
No, my back!

22:54.140 --> 22:55.475
Does it hurt here?

22:55.508 --> 22:56.443
No.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.880
All right, those back pains,

23:00.913 --> 23:01.914
they were contractions.

23:01.948 --> 23:02.982
What? Now?

23:03.015 --> 23:04.984
Baby's crowning.

23:05.017 --> 23:06.018
Should I get a screen?

23:06.052 --> 23:07.487
No, we'll flip the bed.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.122
Get a warmer,
a BOA kit
and page OB.

23:10.156 --> 23:13.025
( alarm )

23:13.059 --> 23:14.461
BP's 80 palp.

23:14.494 --> 23:15.562
Ten blade.

23:15.595 --> 23:16.796
Chuny, everything okay?

23:16.829 --> 23:18.831
Baby's coming,
mom's hypotensive

23:18.865 --> 23:20.533
and we don't have
fetal heart tones yet.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.469
Well, a simple "no"
would've sufficed.

23:22.502 --> 23:23.503
Where's Kovac?

23:23.536 --> 23:24.604
On his way, I guess.

23:24.637 --> 23:25.638
Doesn't he need
a chest X-ray?

23:25.672 --> 23:27.474
32 French.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.476
He's unstable with clinical
evidence of a hemothorax.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.077
Tube first, ask questions later.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.112
Good. Systolic's
up to 100.

23:33.145 --> 23:34.714
Wow, you did that
chest tube really quick.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.883
O-Neg on two pressure bags
set up for a subclavian.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.050
Are you like
the senior resident?

23:38.084 --> 23:39.552
No, I'm like an intern.

23:39.586 --> 23:40.820
What you're gonna be
in a few days.

23:43.222 --> 23:44.824
DORI:
BP is 110 over 76.

23:44.857 --> 23:45.992
How's Riley doing in there?

23:46.025 --> 23:47.059
JARVIK:
Need a central line.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.094
( hoarse ):
Is he okay?

23:48.127 --> 23:49.095
Yeah, he will be.

23:49.128 --> 23:50.162
How's your throat?

23:50.196 --> 23:51.898
A little raw.
All the yelling.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.132
( coughs )

23:53.165 --> 23:54.901
No dorsalis pedis.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.537
No posterior tib.

23:57.570 --> 23:58.905
That doesn't sound good.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.172
You cut the artery
in your foot.

24:00.206 --> 24:02.241
You're gonna need
surgery, all right?

24:02.274 --> 24:03.876
We only called them
a few minutes ago.

24:03.910 --> 24:04.977
I doubt the O.R.'s
gonna be ready.

24:05.011 --> 24:06.579
No, no, no, they will be.

24:06.613 --> 24:07.847
JERRY:
Have them call us back
as soon as they can.

24:07.880 --> 24:08.848
Off the phone.

24:08.881 --> 24:09.849
Go, go.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.183
OR.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.887
I called OB.
They're in the middle

24:14.921 --> 24:16.523
of a crash
section.
There we go.

24:16.556 --> 24:17.857
Head's out, Mom,
lots of hair.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.792
Molly, you're doing
so good, baby. Come on.

24:19.826 --> 24:20.760
Suction.

24:21.861 --> 24:22.962
( crying )

24:22.995 --> 24:24.631
Um... Neela?

24:24.664 --> 24:25.632
Turtle sign.

24:25.665 --> 24:26.899
Jerry, 911 them.

24:26.933 --> 24:28.167
Tell them we've
got a shoulder.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.736
Shoulder dystocia?

24:29.769 --> 24:30.937
Wait, is something wrong
with our baby?

24:30.970 --> 24:32.972
He's a bit big
for your pelvis.

24:33.005 --> 24:34.273
( yells )
You can do this, Molly.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.776
Push again.
Really hard, okay?

24:36.809 --> 24:37.810
Pull her legs back.

24:37.844 --> 24:38.845
( screams )

24:38.878 --> 24:40.179
Anterior shoulder
is stuck.

24:40.212 --> 24:42.048
Suprapubic pressure
as hard as you can.

24:42.081 --> 24:44.283
Another big push, Mom.
Come on.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.952
Molly, push again,
all you've got.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.086
( cries ):
I can't.

24:47.119 --> 24:48.254
You can, Molly.
I know you can.

24:48.287 --> 24:49.756
Come on, baby.

24:49.789 --> 24:50.890
She can't,
contraction's over.

24:50.923 --> 24:53.059
Fetal pulse
is coming back up.

24:53.092 --> 24:56.996
All right, support the head.
Right here.

24:57.029 --> 24:58.297
I'll be back in a second.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.298
Wait, she's leaving?

24:59.331 --> 25:01.000
Why is she leaving?

25:01.033 --> 25:02.735
Abby, I've got
a shoulder dystocia

25:02.769 --> 25:04.070
and OB's MIA.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.271
Uh, did you try
a Wood's screw maneuver?

25:05.304 --> 25:06.673
Never heard of it.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.140
That gives me
a strange satisfaction.

25:08.174 --> 25:10.276
I'm getting a flash
but I can't thread the wire.

25:10.309 --> 25:12.244
They need someone in
there with L and D
experience. I'll do this.

25:12.278 --> 25:14.113
Okay.
You're giving up?

25:14.146 --> 25:15.982
If you can't get a procedure
after the third attempt,

25:16.015 --> 25:17.249
you're never going
to get it.

25:17.283 --> 25:18.718
Is that from
Tintanelli's book?

25:18.751 --> 25:20.019
No, that's the book
of John Carter.

25:20.052 --> 25:21.187
Heartbeat's up to 140...

25:21.220 --> 25:22.288
This guy needs tons of volume.

25:22.321 --> 25:24.056
I'll stay ahead
four units.

25:24.090 --> 25:25.992
What's going on?
Mom's pressure is borderline.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.594
Baby decels
with contractions.

25:27.594 --> 25:28.761
Okay. Hi.

25:28.795 --> 25:29.929
I'm Dr. Lockhart.

25:29.962 --> 25:30.963
Are you from OB?

25:30.997 --> 25:32.064
I used to be, yes.

25:32.098 --> 25:34.834
Okay, let's see if we can...

25:34.867 --> 25:36.235
( Molly groans )

25:36.268 --> 25:38.004
...coax this little guy
out, huh?

25:38.037 --> 25:39.105
It's a girl.

25:39.138 --> 25:40.607
Her name's Janis.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.209
Janis. Okay...

25:43.242 --> 25:45.144
Okay.

25:45.177 --> 25:49.749
I'm going to rotate
Janis' posterior shoulder...

25:49.782 --> 25:52.084
( yelling )
Here comes another
contraction, Mom.

25:52.118 --> 25:53.085
Come on, push!

25:53.119 --> 25:54.220
( yelling )

25:54.253 --> 25:55.888
( groaning )

25:55.922 --> 25:57.790
Flex the arms
across the chest.

25:57.824 --> 25:58.791
Come on. Big push,

25:58.825 --> 26:00.292
okay?

26:00.326 --> 26:02.094
( grunts )
Baby's pulse
is dropping again.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.830
In the 80s, poor variability.

26:03.863 --> 26:05.064
All right, come on, Molly,
focus.

26:05.097 --> 26:06.332
Really big push.

26:06.365 --> 26:09.335
She's tiring out.
Sat's 91.

26:09.368 --> 26:11.103
Okay. All right,
all right, relax.

26:11.137 --> 26:13.172
Okay. Put her on
oxygen, have O-Neg
standing by.

26:13.205 --> 26:14.941
Someone asked me
to bring you this.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.843
Did OB ever call back?
Stuck in the OR.

26:16.876 --> 26:18.110
They said it'd be
about 15 minutes.

26:18.144 --> 26:19.078
How long ago
was that?

26:19.111 --> 26:20.046
Eight minutes ago.

26:23.115 --> 26:24.116
What about Luka?

26:24.150 --> 26:25.117
Want me to
page him again?

26:25.151 --> 26:26.686
No.
All right, you.

26:26.719 --> 26:27.920
Me?
Yeah, you.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.722
You know where Ike Ryan's is?
Yes.

26:29.756 --> 26:32.659
Get over there, find Kovac
and bring him back here fast.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.827
Okay, we can't wait,
not with the late decels.

26:34.861 --> 26:35.962
Betadine, lido and a ten blade.

26:35.995 --> 26:37.897
( cries ):
Get her out.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.032
You're doing a section
by yourself?

26:40.066 --> 26:42.101
Where the hell is Luka?

26:46.873 --> 26:48.074
I only needed one more shot.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.308
I got lucky.

26:49.341 --> 26:51.010
Three times in a row.

26:51.043 --> 26:53.279
You guys just missed Kovac
running the table on me.

26:53.312 --> 26:55.081
DUBENKO:
I've heard Kovac cheats.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.783
Yeah, I didn't
even know

26:56.816 --> 26:58.184
they played pool
in Croatia.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.219
Sure, but we just
used broomsticks

27:00.252 --> 27:01.320
and goat testicles.

27:01.353 --> 27:02.755
Get out of here.

27:02.789 --> 27:03.890
No, it's hard.

27:03.923 --> 27:05.792
Those balls don't
roll straight.

27:05.825 --> 27:06.926
( laughing )

27:06.959 --> 27:08.260
All righty then,
on that note...

27:08.294 --> 27:10.396
let me get out of here,
take the young man home.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.866
Greg...

27:13.900 --> 27:15.267
take care of yourself.
Thank you...

27:15.301 --> 27:16.435
for everything.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.404
Really.
Anytime.

27:18.437 --> 27:20.072
All right, and I'll see
you suckers later.

27:20.106 --> 27:22.174
Enjoy yourselves.

27:22.208 --> 27:23.042
See ya.

27:23.075 --> 27:25.144
Got your
toast ready?

27:25.177 --> 27:26.846
Yeah.

27:26.879 --> 27:28.915
Got to say
something,
don't you?

27:28.948 --> 27:30.082
Do I?

27:30.116 --> 27:32.118
Oh, yeah,
definitely.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.753
Let me go lick
my wounds first.

27:33.786 --> 27:35.321
I'll be right back.

27:40.960 --> 27:44.330
MALIK:
Dr. Lewis said to wait
till she gets here.

27:44.363 --> 27:45.932
When's that
gonna be?

27:45.965 --> 27:47.099
She's on overnight.

27:47.133 --> 27:48.334
She's gonna stop by
on her way in.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.937
( panting ):
Who's...

27:50.970 --> 27:53.072
Who's Ko-vach?

27:54.173 --> 27:55.407
Neela, talk to me.

27:55.441 --> 27:57.076
Porch collapse
in Wrigleyville.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.077
I know that.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.211
Tell me about the patient.

27:59.245 --> 28:00.212
Chest trauma
with two liters

28:00.246 --> 28:01.480
out the left.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.782
We're doing a cut down. Ray?
Yup.

28:02.815 --> 28:03.850
Open it up
to the femoral sheath.

28:07.754 --> 28:08.921
This is the
fastest way

28:08.955 --> 28:10.957
to resuscitate a
peri-arrest patient.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.324
Right?

28:12.358 --> 28:13.793
That's right.

28:13.826 --> 28:14.961
Looks good.

28:14.994 --> 28:16.195
Run the level one.

28:16.228 --> 28:17.429
Do you know Abby's doing

28:17.463 --> 28:19.799
a symphysiotomy
in here?

28:22.134 --> 28:25.104
By dissecting the ligaments
connecting the pubic bone,

28:25.137 --> 28:28.307
you can get up to three more
centimeters of pelvic space.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.142
Fetal tracing.
He's holding in the 90s.

28:30.176 --> 28:31.811
Feels like we opened up
a little bit,

28:31.844 --> 28:33.245
so next
contraction,

28:33.279 --> 28:34.847
big push, okay?

28:34.881 --> 28:36.048
Okay.

28:36.082 --> 28:37.449
Here we go.
Here we go.

28:37.483 --> 28:39.085
( inhales, groans )

28:39.118 --> 28:40.452
LOCKHART:
All right, come
on, Molly.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.254
Come on, Molly, push!

28:42.288 --> 28:43.422
( groaning )

28:43.455 --> 28:44.957
LOCKHART:
Push.
Here she comes.

28:44.991 --> 28:46.092
LOCKHART:
And...

28:46.125 --> 28:47.927
MOLLY ( crying ):
Oh, God!

28:47.960 --> 28:49.228
LOCKHART:
The anterior
shoulder

28:49.261 --> 28:50.262
is out!

28:50.296 --> 28:51.998
( sighing and panting )

28:52.031 --> 28:53.165
( baby crying )

28:53.199 --> 28:55.401
Suction...
and clamp.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.303
( panting )

28:57.336 --> 28:59.105
Scissors
to Dad.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.207
( panting )

29:01.240 --> 29:03.275
( baby cooing )

29:03.309 --> 29:05.177
Oh, wow.

29:05.211 --> 29:06.846
( Kyle panting )

29:06.879 --> 29:08.280
( crying )

29:08.314 --> 29:09.949
Hey, big girl.

29:09.982 --> 29:12.284
( crying )

29:14.053 --> 29:16.422
( whimpering )

29:16.455 --> 29:18.357
( crying )

29:22.895 --> 29:25.031
( Molly sighs )

29:25.064 --> 29:27.867
Hi, Janis. Hi.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.201
KOVAC:
Congratulations.

29:29.235 --> 29:30.302
She's a beauty.

29:30.336 --> 29:31.871
( laughs )

29:37.043 --> 29:39.912
( Molly panting )

29:39.946 --> 29:41.113
( groans )

29:43.015 --> 29:44.283
So, how's school?

29:44.316 --> 29:45.284
It's all right.

29:45.317 --> 29:47.954
You doing okay?

29:47.987 --> 29:50.056
Well, you know,
I'm pretty damn
good with science,

29:50.089 --> 29:51.190
so if you ever
need a hand,

29:51.223 --> 29:52.458
just give me a call.

29:52.491 --> 29:53.860
( glass clinking )

29:53.860 --> 29:55.027
Uh... thanks.

29:55.061 --> 29:56.963
Uh, I got it
from here.

29:59.598 --> 30:00.900
( metal clinking )

30:00.933 --> 30:02.201
Hey, Dad.
Huh? What? Oh.

30:02.234 --> 30:04.203
Hey, Dad, come on,
let's go inside.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.840
( sighs )

30:07.874 --> 30:09.375
Oh, man.

30:09.408 --> 30:10.609
Here, I'm gonna help you up.

30:10.642 --> 30:11.978
KJ, go put
some coffee on.

30:12.011 --> 30:13.145
Come on.
It's okay.

30:13.179 --> 30:14.346
Don't worry,
I got him.

30:14.380 --> 30:16.248
Go ahead,
go inside.

30:16.282 --> 30:17.283
Come on, man,
let's go.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.517
Come on, come
on, man, get up.

30:18.550 --> 30:19.518
All right, all right.

30:19.551 --> 30:21.053
You know
how to walk.

30:21.087 --> 30:22.221
( coughs )

30:22.254 --> 30:23.355
Come on,
sit down.

30:23.389 --> 30:24.523
( sighs, pants )

30:24.556 --> 30:26.358
He give you any trouble, man?

30:26.392 --> 30:28.227
All right, man,
go get the coffee.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.395
He's getting a little older.

30:29.428 --> 30:31.030
He thinks he's smart.

30:31.063 --> 30:33.532
But that don't give him
no excuse to give any lip.

30:33.565 --> 30:35.134
How come you didn't
pick him up, man?

30:35.167 --> 30:37.136
( sighs )

30:37.169 --> 30:38.637
Damn. What time is it?

30:38.670 --> 30:40.106
He was waiting
on you, D.

30:40.139 --> 30:41.140
You never
showed up.

30:41.173 --> 30:42.141
Where were you?

30:43.409 --> 30:45.044
Hey, listen!

30:45.077 --> 30:46.578
You his father.
You understand that?

30:46.612 --> 30:48.414
The only one he's got.

30:51.417 --> 30:54.120
( sighs )

30:59.225 --> 31:01.427
( sighs )

31:01.460 --> 31:03.195
Systolic's up to 110.
Where's Dubenko?

31:03.229 --> 31:04.396
He went up
to get the OR ready.

31:04.430 --> 31:05.597
What about Jessica's ex-lap?

31:05.631 --> 31:07.266
The impaled girl?
Mm-hmm.

31:07.299 --> 31:09.135
Anspaugh took her up to surgery.
She's stable.

31:09.168 --> 31:10.970
Ray, he's
getting
stridorous.

31:11.003 --> 31:13.139
Uh, uh...

31:13.172 --> 31:14.440
Okay. Sleep tight, Riley.

31:14.473 --> 31:16.275
I'll check up on you
in a bit, okay?

31:16.308 --> 31:18.344
All right, come get me
if he decompensates.

31:18.377 --> 31:19.411
( loud, labored breathing )

31:19.445 --> 31:20.612
How's your breathing, man?

31:20.646 --> 31:22.348
A little rough.

31:23.715 --> 31:26.953
Oh, Dr. Neela,
you missed the party.

31:26.986 --> 31:27.954
( loud gasping )

31:27.987 --> 31:29.555
How are you doing, Nick?

31:29.588 --> 31:31.023
( groans )

31:31.057 --> 31:32.491
I'm sorry.
( Nick coughs )

31:32.524 --> 31:36.195
There's crepitus.
NICK:
I had a dream like this.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.229
( loud gasping breath )

31:37.263 --> 31:39.231
Only Ray wasn't with us.

31:39.265 --> 31:40.566
( chuckles )

31:40.599 --> 31:42.034
C-spine's clear,
losing the collar.

31:42.068 --> 31:43.169
Pulse ox 90
on five liters.

31:43.202 --> 31:44.170
20 of etomidate,

31:44.203 --> 31:46.372
120 SUX.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.340
( phone ringing )

31:48.374 --> 31:50.576
Hello?

31:50.609 --> 31:52.511
Yeah, speaking.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.448
My credit card?

31:56.482 --> 31:59.318
No, it hasn't been stolen.

31:59.351 --> 32:01.387
Alex?

32:10.596 --> 32:12.331
Alex!

32:13.465 --> 32:14.533
I'd like to thank you all

32:14.566 --> 32:16.468
for coming tonight.

32:19.038 --> 32:21.473
I consider myself...

32:21.507 --> 32:23.542
a lucky man.

32:23.575 --> 32:25.011
Yeah, a lucky man...

32:25.044 --> 32:26.245
That's good...

32:26.278 --> 32:28.347
for Lou Gehrig.

32:38.724 --> 32:41.093
It's been...

32:42.494 --> 32:44.430
11 years.

32:48.667 --> 32:51.070
And I feel...

32:51.103 --> 32:53.372
like I grew up here
with all of you.

32:56.742 --> 32:58.644
Hmm.

33:10.422 --> 33:12.058
Where did everybody go?

33:12.091 --> 33:13.259
Work.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.394
They said they'd be back.

33:19.431 --> 33:21.133
Are you new in the ER?

33:21.167 --> 33:23.135
Uh-uh. Geriatrics.

33:23.169 --> 33:24.403
Heard there
was free food.

33:24.436 --> 33:25.771
Ah.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.080
I like you
with the beard.

33:37.649 --> 33:40.452
( laughs )

33:54.500 --> 33:56.602
( murmuring )

34:01.640 --> 34:03.275
Keep an eye on
the stats, all right?

34:03.309 --> 34:07.113
All right, I'll check
your crit in angio.
Okay.

34:07.146 --> 34:08.414
Symphysiotomy, huh?

34:08.447 --> 34:10.116
Uh-huh. Healthy girl.

34:10.116 --> 34:11.350
Eight pounds, ten ounces.

34:11.382 --> 34:12.851
Dr. Barnett, I was
told you demanded

34:12.884 --> 34:14.420
we not take any patients
before the tib-fib guy.

34:14.453 --> 34:15.821
I re-prioritized.

34:15.853 --> 34:19.791
Take Neela's patient first.
My guy can wait.

34:19.824 --> 34:21.827
( sighing )

34:24.496 --> 34:26.264
They took me to Lakeview.

34:26.297 --> 34:27.565
I couldn't find a taxi.

34:27.599 --> 34:29.467
What do you guys need?

34:29.501 --> 34:30.502
We're all good, Morris.

34:30.536 --> 34:33.139
Really? You sure?

34:33.139 --> 34:34.706
I'm gonna go lie down.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.250
Hey, you guys all
ditched Carter.

34:44.283 --> 34:45.751
He was hugging some huge
orderly when I got there.

34:45.784 --> 34:47.652
We've got it under
control now.

34:47.686 --> 34:50.556
Well, that's good. Cosmo's been
screaming like a banshee.

34:50.589 --> 34:53.159
I intend to spend my overnight
shift sleeping in the lounge.

34:53.192 --> 34:54.260
Carter, your volleyball
girl's up in traps,

34:54.293 --> 34:55.393
ready for the reduction.

34:55.427 --> 34:56.395
That's okay,
I'll get it.

34:56.428 --> 34:57.396
No, I'll take it.

34:57.429 --> 34:58.397
One more for the road.

34:58.430 --> 34:59.631
How long you
here for?

34:59.665 --> 35:00.766
I just have
to pick up some stuff.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.201
How 'bout you?

35:02.234 --> 35:03.735
I'm off as soon
as you're ready.

35:03.769 --> 35:04.870
How's "never" sound?

35:06.905 --> 35:09.741
Luka, did you hear from Alex?

35:09.775 --> 35:12.244
Is he here?

35:12.278 --> 35:14.646
Why do I have to hang
my hand from these things?

35:14.680 --> 35:15.914
Janell,
manners.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.183
So that I can
re-align your bones.

35:17.216 --> 35:19.185
Hello, I'm Dr. Carter.

35:19.218 --> 35:22.821
Clyde Parkerson.
My wife, Eva.

35:22.854 --> 35:25.591
I'm sure that Janell told
you she broke her wrist.

35:25.624 --> 35:26.858
AKA Colles' fracture.

35:26.892 --> 35:29.495
And that we gave her
a local anesthesia.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.263
AKA hematoma block.

35:31.297 --> 35:32.731
( chuckles ):
And that she has

35:32.764 --> 35:34.500
a future in medicine,
it would seem.

35:34.533 --> 35:36.368
AKA I'll be rich.

35:36.402 --> 35:38.337
CHUNY:
I'll give you
counter-traction.

35:38.370 --> 35:40.672
EVA:
Dr. Carter, do
you remember us?

35:44.243 --> 35:47.279
Um... I'm sorry, I don't.

35:49.381 --> 35:50.782
Cast padding.

35:50.816 --> 35:53.219
I was a patient here
in 1994.

35:53.219 --> 35:54.586
( chuckles ):
Really?

35:54.620 --> 35:56.855
CLYDE:
We went into premature
labor at 32 weeks.

35:56.888 --> 35:59.491
EVA:
There was no time to get
me to the OB floor,

35:59.525 --> 36:01.827
so I gave birth here,
in the ER.

36:01.860 --> 36:04.230
You delivered her.

36:10.436 --> 36:11.870
I did?

36:14.005 --> 36:15.674
( chuckles ):
Cool.

36:18.444 --> 36:20.412
Two-inch roll.

36:20.446 --> 36:22.314
Um...

36:22.348 --> 36:24.750
can I have the purple cast?

36:24.783 --> 36:26.552
Whatever you want.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.290
He must have gone
through my purse.

36:31.323 --> 36:32.491
He tried to buy a bus ticket?

36:32.524 --> 36:33.892
They wouldn't
let him.

36:33.925 --> 36:35.994
He took off while they
were calling the cops.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.563
He probably went
to a friend's apartment.

36:37.596 --> 36:38.564
I called them all.

36:38.597 --> 36:39.598
What did the police say?

36:39.631 --> 36:40.999
They said for me
to, um,

36:41.032 --> 36:42.434
wait at home while
they're searching,

36:42.468 --> 36:43.969
but I'm not just
gonna sit there.

36:44.002 --> 36:45.704
I have to go try
to find him.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.506
What if he shows up
at the apartment?

36:47.539 --> 36:48.607
Erica's there.
She's gonna stay.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.376
How much cash did he get?

36:50.409 --> 36:51.643
Uh, about 80.

36:51.677 --> 36:53.345
Maybe a hundred.
I don't know.

36:53.379 --> 36:55.281
He's pissed.
He's just walking it off.

36:55.314 --> 36:56.915
He tried to buy
a ticket to Colorado.

36:56.948 --> 36:58.950
He's gonna do whatever
he can to see Steve.

36:58.984 --> 37:00.452
He's not gonna stop.

37:00.486 --> 37:01.720
He doesn't have
his glucometer.

37:01.753 --> 37:02.988
He doesn't have
his syringes,

37:03.021 --> 37:04.423
he doesn't have
his insulin...

37:04.456 --> 37:05.757
Sam, Sam, Sam,
hey, hey, hey.

37:05.791 --> 37:07.893
He'll be okay
for the next 12 hours.

37:07.926 --> 37:09.828
We'll find him way
before then.

37:09.861 --> 37:11.630
Let me get my jacket.

37:11.663 --> 37:14.333
Hey, uh, Luka, will you, uh,

37:14.366 --> 37:16.001
will you get some
NPH from lock-up,

37:16.034 --> 37:19.405
and some D5 and some
D10, too, okay?

37:19.438 --> 37:20.406
Okay.

37:38.824 --> 37:41.427
( doorbell rings )

37:50.402 --> 37:51.770
Hey.

37:51.803 --> 37:53.339
Can I help you?

37:53.372 --> 37:56.041
Yeah, I'm looking
for Charlie Pratt.

37:56.074 --> 37:57.976
I know you?

37:58.009 --> 38:00.979
Your name is Charlie Pratt?

38:01.012 --> 38:03.449
Yeah.

38:05.484 --> 38:07.519
I'm sorry,
I must have got it wrong.

38:07.553 --> 38:10.021
MAN:
Chas, who is it?

38:13.392 --> 38:15.361
Is there a problem?

38:15.394 --> 38:17.363
Are you Charlie?

38:17.396 --> 38:19.598
Are you a bill collector?

38:23.402 --> 38:25.371
Then, yeah, I'm Charlie.

38:25.404 --> 38:29.107
I'm an ER doc over at County.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.376
Is somebody sick?

38:30.409 --> 38:32.478
No. No, nothing like that.

38:32.511 --> 38:35.046
I, um, I got your name from
the folks at Ceasefire.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.848
Couldn't wait till morning?

38:36.882 --> 38:40.786
I'm gonna be there tomorrow
for the meeting anyway.

38:44.756 --> 38:47.092
You're right. It can wait.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.395
You all right, son?

38:53.499 --> 38:56.435
Yeah, I'm okay.

38:56.468 --> 38:59.004
Maybe you ought
to come in.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.409
Sorry if I disturbed you.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.050
Did I spell...

39:12.083 --> 39:13.952
"symphysiotomy"
right?

39:13.985 --> 39:15.454
Yeah.

39:15.487 --> 39:16.522
Thank you.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.528
LOCKHART:
How's your friend?

39:22.561 --> 39:24.496
Missed the aorta.

39:24.530 --> 39:26.164
Anspaugh
fixed her up.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.534
Jessica's gonna be fine.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.602
You look tired.

39:30.636 --> 39:33.171
You should go home.

39:33.204 --> 39:37.576
Mm-mm, I want to be here
when my friends wake up.

39:37.609 --> 39:39.077
All right, then.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.012
Help yourself to a chart.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.626
Dr. Carter.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.595
I was just on
my way out.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.730
Thought
I'd stop by.

39:58.764 --> 39:59.965
Sorry we missed
the party.

39:59.998 --> 40:03.602
Eh, you weren't the only ones.

40:03.635 --> 40:06.572
So I just found this
in my locker.

40:06.605 --> 40:09.675
It has been in there
for a very long time.

40:09.708 --> 40:11.176
And, to be honest,

40:11.209 --> 40:16.582
I haven't given it much
thought for many years.

40:16.615 --> 40:17.649
Not since Mark died.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.087
You see, when you were
an intern under Dr. Greene,

40:22.120 --> 40:24.556
he would have everybody
write a letter to themselves

40:24.590 --> 40:25.891
that they wouldn't open

40:25.924 --> 40:28.527
until their
very last day of residency.

40:28.560 --> 40:31.497
So... that's your
letter to yourself?

40:32.931 --> 40:34.833
What's it say?

40:37.035 --> 40:39.437
It says...

40:41.873 --> 40:44.810
that I'm scared.

40:44.843 --> 40:47.713
And that I know
I have a lot to learn,

40:47.746 --> 40:51.049
and I hope I
learn it quickly.

40:51.082 --> 40:54.986
And that I pray to God
that I don't kill anybody.

40:57.255 --> 40:59.725
And it says,
um, that if

40:59.758 --> 41:02.728
I'm good at this...

41:02.761 --> 41:04.530
and I can stick it out

41:04.530 --> 41:07.265
and become
an attending,

41:07.298 --> 41:10.268
well...

41:10.301 --> 41:12.538
it'll be all I ever need.

41:25.016 --> 41:27.052
I got a plane to catch.

41:31.289 --> 41:33.024
GREENE:
One day, you'll look up

41:33.058 --> 41:36.562
and maybe, uh,
ten years will have passed.

41:36.562 --> 41:37.896
BENTON:
Carter...

41:37.929 --> 41:40.599
you're going
to make a good doctor.

41:40.632 --> 41:41.667
HATHAWAY:
Carter, you got to hurry it up.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.001
You got a million things to do.

41:43.034 --> 41:44.870
ROSS:
My mom told me that you never

41:44.903 --> 41:46.104
put anything in your ears
smaller than your elbow.

41:46.137 --> 41:48.674
GREENE:
You set the tone, Carter.

41:57.248 --> 41:59.084
( Morris groaning )

42:01.653 --> 42:03.689
Morris?

42:03.722 --> 42:05.023
I think I might
puke again.

42:09.027 --> 42:10.195
You set the tone, Morris.

42:10.228 --> 42:13.164
Huh?

42:16.067 --> 42:17.969
( chuckles )

42:18.003 --> 42:19.971
Never mind.

42:28.980 --> 42:30.148
What's that?

42:30.181 --> 42:31.216
My contract.

42:31.249 --> 42:32.884
Oh.

42:32.918 --> 42:36.788
Okay, then I guess you have
some more writing to do.

42:36.822 --> 42:38.757
It's good enough for Carter.

42:45.030 --> 42:48.299
Think it's weird if
I put "Dear Neela"?

42:48.333 --> 42:51.637
Hey, Erica, any word?

42:51.670 --> 42:53.905
Did Bobby's mom
call back?

42:53.939 --> 42:54.940
He wasn't
with them?

42:54.973 --> 42:57.643
Okay.

42:57.643 --> 42:59.778
Yeah, it's gonna be all right.

42:59.811 --> 43:02.914
Uh, what about Navy Pier?
He likes the rides there.

43:02.948 --> 43:04.282
It's after 11:00, it's closed.

43:04.315 --> 43:06.317
What about your cell phone,
is it charged?

43:06.351 --> 43:08.954
Sam. Sam.

43:08.987 --> 43:11.189
It's all going to be okay.

43:28.073 --> 43:30.976
( honking )
