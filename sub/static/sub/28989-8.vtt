WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.207
(HARVEY READING)

00:02.294 --> 00:04.126
My name is Andrew Malik.

00:04.213 --> 00:05.920
While you were kissing
Cameron Dennis' ass,

00:06.006 --> 00:07.496
I was putting
the real criminals away.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.252
You may not have
remembered me then,

00:09.510 --> 00:11.672
but you're sure as hell
gonna remember me now.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.002
I just got a visit
from Sean Cahill.

00:13.096 --> 00:14.632
There's a way
he can get you out.

00:14.723 --> 00:15.758
What's the catch?

00:15.849 --> 00:17.339
He needs you to inform
on your cellmate.

00:17.434 --> 00:18.924
I've been after Sutter
for three years now.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.384
This guy's one
slippery son of a bitch.

00:20.479 --> 00:22.220
You pulled every string you
have to make this happen.

00:22.314 --> 00:23.304
You're gonna
pull out now?

00:23.398 --> 00:26.106
I am, 'cause I'm not gonna put
myself in position to collude with you.

00:26.193 --> 00:29.811
You filed a countersuit
against my explicit instructions?

00:29.905 --> 00:31.487
I didn't ask you because
you wouldn't have listened.

00:31.573 --> 00:32.607
You set me up.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.273
I'm gonna make sure
the world knows.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.200
You can tell the world
anything you want, William,

00:36.286 --> 00:37.572
but you got no proof.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.904
Either way, I suggest
you sign this deal.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.488
Damn it, you said
you were gonna defend him

00:41.583 --> 00:43.119
to the best
of your ability.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.998
And I meant it, but I also
knew, if push came to shove,

00:46.088 --> 00:48.250
I'd do what I had to
to get Mike out.

00:48.340 --> 00:49.330
So let's just admit

00:49.424 --> 00:51.165
that we're in this together
and get this thing done.

00:51.260 --> 00:52.421
You son of a bitch.

00:52.511 --> 00:53.967
You got nothing on me because
there's nothing to have.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.135
The only question is,

00:55.222 --> 00:57.054
which of the many times
that you've crossed the line

00:57.140 --> 00:58.972
am I planning on exposing
to the world?

01:04.855 --> 01:06.517
HARVEY: Sean,
what are you doing here?

01:06.608 --> 01:08.474
I thought you said you
never wanted to see me again.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.855
Believe me, Harvey,
I wouldn't be here

01:09.945 --> 01:11.936
if Andrew Malik
hadn't just had me arrested.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.020
What?

01:13.115 --> 01:15.982
He's claiming we conspired to
swap Mike Ross for William Sutter.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.362
I'm here to get
our stories straight.

01:17.452 --> 01:18.988
You want
our stories straight?

01:20.038 --> 01:21.779
I'm representing you
as of right now.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.455
Representing me?
What are you talking about?

01:23.542 --> 01:24.748
You wearing a wire, Sean?

01:24.835 --> 01:26.075
You think I'm here
to entrap you?

01:26.169 --> 01:27.455
Don't act like
that's not possible.

01:27.546 --> 01:30.004
You had me wear a wire
to nail Charles Forstman,

01:30.090 --> 01:32.377
and now you're coming to me
out of the blue,

01:32.467 --> 01:33.798
accusing me
of colluding with you.

01:33.885 --> 01:35.250
You know what, Harvey?
You want to pat me down?

01:35.345 --> 01:36.676
Feel free if that's
what you think of me.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.095
What I think, Sean, is you
need to take me up on my offer.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.217
And how is that gonna look?

01:40.309 --> 01:42.846
You repping me when we've
been accused of colluding?

01:42.936 --> 01:44.222
I don't give a shit
what it looks like.

01:44.313 --> 01:46.145
You hire me,
we can talk about anything

01:46.231 --> 01:47.471
and it's not admissible.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.807
All right, Harvey.
You're my lawyer.

01:50.152 --> 01:51.734
Now, let's talk
about the story.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.482
Partner's log,
stardate 2-0-1-9.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.159
The search
for a baby name continues.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.528
We have arrived
at the letter I,

02:02.623 --> 02:05.240
where Sheila has sent me an
email with her top three choices.

02:05.876 --> 02:06.866
Levi Litt.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.785
Great idea, Sheila.
Was "Jewwy Jewstein" taken?

02:10.631 --> 02:12.963
Linus Litt, otherwise
known as "Linus Vaginus,

02:13.050 --> 02:14.336
"the kid who died
a virgin."

02:14.926 --> 02:16.633
Esther. What are
you doing here?

02:16.845 --> 02:19.758
I know it's late, Louis, but
I was hoping we could talk.

02:19.848 --> 02:23.182
Of course. Is this about the merger
you wanted me to take a look at?

02:23.310 --> 02:25.017
It is. Oh. Well,
guess what? I did.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.269
And the deal is
as solid as a rock.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.848
So there's no reason for
my board to turn it down?

02:30.942 --> 02:32.558
No. Not a one.
Shit.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.105
Esther, what's going on?

02:34.196 --> 02:35.561
Louis, I'm gonna
tell you something.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.569
You have to promise me
you're not gonna tell anyone

02:38.659 --> 02:40.366
and you're not gonna
lose your head over it.

02:40.452 --> 02:41.738
Esther, I don't understand.

02:43.664 --> 02:46.577
Fifteen years ago,
Paul Richmond assaulted me.

02:46.792 --> 02:47.782
What?

02:47.876 --> 02:48.991
But you always said
he was your mentor.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.999
He stopped being my mentor
that night, Louis.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.588
We were at a conference
in Miami.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.006
He asked me to his room.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.754
The next thing I knew,
his hands were all over me.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.085
And when I pushed him away
and told him to stop,

03:00.180 --> 03:02.888
he got angry,
said I'd been leading him on.

03:02.974 --> 03:04.965
He started forcing
himself on me.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.051
Then what happened?

03:07.145 --> 03:09.136
I ran out there
as fast as I could,

03:09.231 --> 03:10.847
went to my room,
and threw up.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.649
I can't have him
in my company, Louis.

03:13.735 --> 03:14.725
No, you can't.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.228
Which is why you're going
to go to the board right now

03:17.322 --> 03:18.687
and tell them what
that motherfucker did.

03:18.782 --> 03:21.240
No. I am not doing that.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.358
Why not?

03:22.452 --> 03:24.363
Because it happened
15 years ago.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.785
And in case
you haven't noticed,

03:25.872 --> 03:28.079
women who come forward
get put through a meat grinder.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.406
I know that, Esther,
but...

03:29.501 --> 03:31.162
Louis, I just told you
what happened

03:31.253 --> 03:33.244
and the first words
out of your mouth were,

03:33.338 --> 03:34.828
"But he was your mentor."

03:35.590 --> 03:37.376
You're my brother,
and you said that.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.424
What do you think
everyone else will say?

03:39.511 --> 03:41.297
Well, I just can't let him
get away with it!

03:41.388 --> 03:43.504
Louis, I know you want
to rip his head off,

03:43.890 --> 03:47.428
but what I need from you
is to make this deal go away.

03:50.605 --> 03:51.595
(DOOR OPENING)

03:54.901 --> 03:57.484
Before you say anything,
I'm sorry that I took so long.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.187
What happened? Did you
pick the grapes yourself?

03:59.531 --> 04:01.442
The first place didn't
have the bottle I wanted.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.490
Ooh, '85 Cotes du Rhone.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.069
This is an outstanding
bottle of wine.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.203
There's also no way it's
the reason you took so long.

04:08.290 --> 04:09.371
Donna, what are
you getting at?

04:09.458 --> 04:10.869
You care
about whiskey, Harvey.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.245
You don't give a shit
about wine,

04:12.377 --> 04:14.288
which means that
something stopped you.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.213
And if you're hiding it
from me, it must be serious.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.289
All right.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.709
I went out, and when I got
back, Cahill was waiting.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.846
Malik's coming after him for
conspiring with me two years ago.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.468
Oh, my God.
This is about Mike.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.675
It is, but, Donna...
Don't "but Donna" me.

04:30.395 --> 04:33.103
Harvey, Andy Malik doesn't
care about Sean Cahill.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.680
If he's doing this,
he's coming after you.

04:34.775 --> 04:35.856
You think
I don't know that?

04:35.942 --> 04:36.977
I know you know it,

04:37.068 --> 04:39.435
but you didn't want to tell me
about it, and I want to know why.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.315
Because I didn't
want you to worry.

04:43.158 --> 04:44.740
You mean,
because you're worried.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.658
If Sean didn't just agree
to let me represent him,

04:46.745 --> 04:47.735
I would be.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.285
But he did.
So we're good.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.988
"Good"? You don't even know
what Malik has.

04:51.082 --> 04:52.368
Donna, I know
what we're up against,

04:52.459 --> 04:54.291
but I can't have you
doubting me on this.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.833
I'm not doubting you, Harvey.

04:55.921 --> 04:58.959
It's just this whole thing hinges
on you and Sean sticking together.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.585
Do you really think
we can trust him?

05:00.675 --> 05:01.665
That's what I'm telling you.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.250
We don't have
any other choice.

05:05.889 --> 05:09.132
(SINGING) See the money
Wanna stay for your meal

05:09.226 --> 05:12.264
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

05:12.354 --> 05:15.892
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

05:15.982 --> 05:19.191
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

05:19.277 --> 05:22.440
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

05:22.531 --> 05:24.272
Me and missy is so early

05:24.366 --> 05:25.982
Busy, busy making money

05:26.076 --> 05:27.066
All right!

05:27.160 --> 05:32.746
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

05:33.625 --> 05:35.332
The greenback boogie

05:36.419 --> 05:37.625
Your Honor,
this is outrageous.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.703
Sean Cahill can't be
represented by Harvey Specter.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.505
They're using
attorney-client privilege

05:41.591 --> 05:44.253
to get away with the conspiracy
they engaged in in the first place.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.927
Not engaged in,
are accused of engaging in.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.300
And how is it any different
than a joint defense agreement?

05:49.391 --> 05:50.381
I'll tell you
how it's different,

05:50.475 --> 05:51.965
you're setting this thing up
for a mistrial.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.051
Because when I win, that's
exactly what he'll ask for.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.681
Your Honor, I will resign

05:55.772 --> 05:57.058
as Mr. Cahill's attorney

05:57.148 --> 05:58.388
right now if he hands this

05:58.483 --> 05:59.473
case over to someone else,

05:59.568 --> 06:01.400
but he won't, because
no one else will touch it.

06:01.486 --> 06:02.476
I'm not walking away

06:02.571 --> 06:03.902
from a case that I've been
building for eight months.

06:03.989 --> 06:05.479
And if you're so sure
we did this,

06:05.574 --> 06:06.609
why aren't you
coming after me?

06:06.700 --> 06:07.690
Because I focus
on the bigger fish.

06:07.784 --> 06:08.865
That's a load of crap.

06:08.994 --> 06:10.029
You're not charging me

06:10.120 --> 06:11.576
because you know
it'll look like a vendetta.

06:11.663 --> 06:12.869
All right. That's enough.

06:13.665 --> 06:17.579
Are you willing to waive your
right to a mistrial, Mr. Cahill?

06:17.669 --> 06:18.784
I am.

06:18.879 --> 06:22.292
Well, then I'm afraid he has a right
to his counsel of choice, Mr. Malik.

06:22.382 --> 06:26.967
And I want discovery documents
in his offices in an hour.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.252
(BANGS GAVEL)

06:30.473 --> 06:32.635
Hey, you think he's
gonna get you out of this,

06:32.726 --> 06:34.387
but he doesn't
care about you.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.093
He only cares
about himself.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.351
If we're supposed to be
sticking together in this,

06:40.442 --> 06:42.103
what the hell are you doing
volunteering to drop me?

06:42.193 --> 06:43.775
Sean, I did it
to make a point.

06:43.862 --> 06:44.977
He was never gonna
take me up on it.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.857
And if he did,
I'd be in this alone.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.609
So next time
you feel like freelancing,

06:48.700 --> 06:49.735
why don't you
run it by me first?

06:49.826 --> 06:51.157
Okay. I will.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.484
Now let's get back
to the office,

06:52.579 --> 06:53.944
because if I know Malik,

06:54.039 --> 06:56.952
there's gonna be some kind
of curveball in that discovery.

06:58.668 --> 06:59.999
Whatever it is
you're doing,

07:00.086 --> 07:01.247
I got something
more important.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.500
In that case, I'm all
yours. What do you need?

07:03.590 --> 07:06.048
A legitimate reason to stop
a merger from happening.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.667
This is Esther's company.

07:08.762 --> 07:09.923
It is, and she used to

07:10.013 --> 07:11.378
work for the man
that runs the other company,

07:11.473 --> 07:13.714
and let's just say
they are like oil and water.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.765
If that's true, why does he
even want to merge with her?

07:15.852 --> 07:17.468
Because my sister's
a brilliant businesswoman,

07:17.562 --> 07:19.849
and the easiest way for a
scumbag like that to make money

07:19.940 --> 07:21.430
is to leech off
of her success.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.390
Now, do you want to
help me solve this or not?

07:23.485 --> 07:24.646
Of course I do.
Good,

07:24.736 --> 07:26.022
because a lawsuit
will gum up the works,

07:26.112 --> 07:27.443
but I don't see
any grounds.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.613
What about other suitors?
Nope. Too late for that.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.905
Her board just got
proposed to,

07:30.992 --> 07:32.608
and no one's walking in
with a bigger diamond.

07:32.702 --> 07:35.911
Louis, when it comes to
diamonds, bigger isn't always better.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.863
There is cut,
there is color...

07:37.958 --> 07:38.948
And there's clarity,

07:39.209 --> 07:41.997
which means that 30% premium
is compensating for something.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.623
Therefore, if we want
to tank this deal,

07:43.713 --> 07:45.670
we just have to
figure out what it is.

07:49.970 --> 07:53.179
Faye, if you're here to thank me for
letting you off the hook with the Bar,

07:53.264 --> 07:54.675
I've got my hands full
at the moment.

07:54.766 --> 07:57.383
According to Andrew Malik,
you should have plenty of time.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.967
I don't believe this.
He called you?

07:59.062 --> 08:00.052
Yes, he did.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.103
He wants you off this case,
and I agree with him.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.271
Okay.

08:03.358 --> 08:04.689
I know you're not
a real attorney,

08:04.776 --> 08:06.687
so I'm gonna
spell it out for you.

08:06.778 --> 08:09.736
He's using you because he
knows I'm gonna beat him.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.064
I don't care what he's doing.
I don't want you handling this.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.399
I just went to court
to be able to represent Sean.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.076
I'm not going to
turn around and drop him.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.620
And I'm not saying we should.
I'll represent him.

08:18.707 --> 08:19.742
You?

08:19.833 --> 08:21.790
I could have two hands
tied behind my back

08:21.876 --> 08:24.038
and cinder blocks at my
ankles, and I'd be better than you.

08:24.129 --> 08:26.871
No, you wouldn't, because
you colluded with the man.

08:26.965 --> 08:29.047
Your interests are
at odds with each other.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.750
In other words,
you think I did this.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.336
I don't think you did it.
I read you did it.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.171
What the hell
are you talking about?

08:35.265 --> 08:37.506
Malik has an affidavit
from Kevin Miller

08:37.600 --> 08:40.558
swearing that you conspired
with Sean Cahill

08:40.645 --> 08:42.852
to get him and Mike Ross
out of prison.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.931
You once told me you
got Mr. Miller out of a jam.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.767
Well, now I know
what that jam was

08:47.861 --> 08:49.226
and what it took
to get him out of it.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.403
Well, you know what? I'm not
the one on trial here. Sean is.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.857
And if you want to file
a motion denying my client

08:54.951 --> 08:57.033
his attorney of choice,
then go right ahead.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.203
But until then,
I've got actual work to do.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.876
Louis! What a pleasure to
finally meet Esther's brother

09:05.962 --> 09:07.077
after all these years.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.539
I understand you have some
questions regarding the merger.

09:09.632 --> 09:10.918
I'm not here
to ask questions, Paul.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.341
I'm here to tell you
this merger is not happening.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.627
Well, that's certainly
news to me.

09:15.722 --> 09:16.883
Just like
it was news to us

09:16.973 --> 09:18.680
that your supplier
is on the brink of bankruptcy.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.804
You're looking for a lifeline,
and that's what this is really about.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.056
What this is about is two
companies that have synergy

09:23.146 --> 09:24.887
utilizing their
respective resources.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.473
Well, you're gonna have to go
after someone else's resources

09:27.567 --> 09:29.683
because as of right now,
ours are off-limits.

09:29.778 --> 09:32.645
And I informed your board
of the supplier situation,

09:32.739 --> 09:35.697
which makes me think you're
not here on behalf of your client.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.024
You're here
on behalf of your sister.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.233
You're damn right I am.

09:38.328 --> 09:39.659
Well, then,
this is inappropriate.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.532
Excuse me?
I assured the board

09:41.623 --> 09:42.784
I won't let her go.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.990
Anything beyond that
is between she and them.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.917
Well, according to
company bylaws,

09:47.003 --> 09:49.085
we have one day
to reject this offer,

09:49.172 --> 09:51.004
and I'm triggering that
right now.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.048
You can't do that
without board approval.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.795
Well, then I'll find
some other loophole,

09:54.886 --> 09:57.048
because you're not getting
anywhere near my sister's company.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.549
Well, then as far
as I'm concerned,

09:58.640 --> 10:00.176
it's not your
sister's company anymore.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.256
It's mine.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.217
You piece of shit!
I know what you did.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.642
And if you don't back off,

10:04.729 --> 10:06.891
so help me,
I will come right after you.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.223
I have no idea
what you're referring to.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.229
Fifteen years ago, asshole!

10:12.320 --> 10:15.403
Miami. You attacked her.
You know you did.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.777
That's why you went
to her board and not her.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.824
Because you knew
she would never agree.

10:19.911 --> 10:21.117
And if that were true,

10:21.204 --> 10:23.821
why did she stay with my
company for five more years

10:23.915 --> 10:26.122
and is only now fabricating
this whole thing?

10:26.209 --> 10:28.792
I'll tell you why, because
she's looking to save her job.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.664
So unless you want
to defend her from slander,

10:30.755 --> 10:32.245
you'll drop this.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.173
Now get out of my office
before I call security.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.098
We've got a problem.
SEAN: You're damn right we do.

10:44.185 --> 10:45.801
Was Mike Ross
really dumb enough

10:45.895 --> 10:48.011
to straight up tell his
cellmate what we did?

10:48.106 --> 10:50.438
He wasn't dumb, Sean.
We needed Kevin to trust us.

10:50.525 --> 10:51.890
And that's another thing
you should've run by me,

10:51.985 --> 10:54.568
'cause now I have to go tell
that ex-con if he doesn't recant,

10:54.654 --> 10:57.237
I'm gonna slap him with a parole
violation and he's going back to prison.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.405
And you do that, Malik will
get you for witness tampering.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.153
I'm not gonna sit on my
hands and just do nothing.

11:01.244 --> 11:02.279
HARVEY: You're right.
You're not.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.656
Malik went over my head.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.407
I think it's time
we went over his.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.081
Why don't you bring some of
that SEC pressure to bear on him?

11:08.168 --> 11:09.158
I get it.

11:09.252 --> 11:11.084
This is a vendetta,
and when it goes south,

11:11.171 --> 11:14.163
it's gonna look as bad for
Malik's superiors as it does for him.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.793
In the meantime, I'll keep
wading through this shit,

11:15.884 --> 11:16.999
because something
doesn't smell right.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.083
What do you mean?

11:18.178 --> 11:19.794
I mean, the Sutter case
was in the public record,

11:19.888 --> 11:21.253
and so was Mike's release.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.384
So why is Malik
bringing it up years later?

11:23.474 --> 11:24.964
I don't know, but the
person that can shed light

11:25.059 --> 11:27.016
on that very question
is Kevin Miller.

11:29.480 --> 11:30.470
KEVIN: Harvey.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.356
I can't say I'm surprised
to see you.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.104
I may not be surprising you,
Kevin,

11:35.195 --> 11:36.811
but you sure as hell
surprised me.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.942
Look, if you wanna call me an
asshole, you might as well get to it.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.022
I'm not here
to yell at you.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.652
I'm here to find out
what the hell are you doing

11:41.743 --> 11:43.325
playing ball
with Andy Malik?

11:43.411 --> 11:45.243
Harvey, he said
if he convicted Cahill

11:45.330 --> 11:47.822
and we didn't cooperate,
he'd void the deal we made,

11:47.916 --> 11:50.658
Jill would go to prison,
and I'd go with her.

11:50.752 --> 11:51.958
And let me guess,

11:52.045 --> 11:54.207
he gave you immunity
in exchange for talking.

11:54.297 --> 11:57.085
And he made it contingent
on me not warning you about it.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.963
I'm sorry, Harvey, but I
was backed into a corner.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.169
You should have
come to me anyway.

12:02.263 --> 12:03.424
You owed me that much.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.214
I know I owe you.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.218
That's why I didn't
give Malik everything.

12:10.772 --> 12:13.855
He has my affidavit,
but he doesn't have proof.

12:13.942 --> 12:15.774
The recording
I made of Sutter.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.147
I didn't tell him it exists,
and I'm not going to.

12:18.238 --> 12:21.071
But if you're here to get me
to change my story,

12:21.616 --> 12:23.482
that's as far as
my owing you goes.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.658
Then answer one question.
We did this years ago.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.452
Why didn't Sutter
go to Malik until now?

12:27.538 --> 12:29.154
That's the thing.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.616
I don't know who went
to Malik, but it wasn't him.

12:31.709 --> 12:32.870
How can you know that?

12:32.961 --> 12:34.998
Because Sutter died
eight months ago.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.214
Here's what I don't get.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.512
Malik couldn't know
any of this without Sutter,

12:46.599 --> 12:49.682
which means Sutter must have
reached out to him before he died.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.680
But that was
close to a year ago,

12:51.771 --> 12:54.638
and there's no reason Malik
would sit on this for that long.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.689
Then he must have found out
from someone else,

12:56.776 --> 12:58.358
because there's no record
of any conversation

12:58.444 --> 12:59.900
between Malik
and Sutter ever.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.695
That doesn't mean
it didn't happen.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.067
It means Malik's hiding it.

13:03.157 --> 13:04.943
Harvey, why would he
expose himself like that?

13:05.034 --> 13:06.695
The case could get tossed
on a technicality.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.527
He's played fast
and loose before.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.861
Maybe he's doing it again.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.617
DONNA: He might be,
but not about this.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.824
The warrant that Malik used
to go after Kevin Miller

13:13.918 --> 13:15.784
had to show probable cause.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.835
It turns out it was
a deathbed confession

13:17.922 --> 13:19.959
by Sutter to an informant
whose name was redacted.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.039
Under what grounds?

13:21.134 --> 13:23.045
To protect him against
retribution in prison,

13:23.136 --> 13:24.376
which is what
I wanted to show you,

13:24.470 --> 13:26.711
because the name of the
prison is gonna ring a bell.

13:26.806 --> 13:27.967
Holy shit.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.092
Pat me on the back later,
Harvey.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.514
It's what needed
to be done.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.091
What needs
to be done right now

13:32.186 --> 13:33.847
is for me to go
see an old friend.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.023
What the hell
did you do?

13:38.484 --> 13:42.022
I came to you to find me a way
out of this, and the next thing I know,

13:42.113 --> 13:44.320
my own board
triggered my buyout clause.

13:44.407 --> 13:45.397
Shit.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.073
You fucking told him,
didn't you?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.242
Esther, you weren't there. I
tried not to say anything, but...

13:49.329 --> 13:52.367
God damn it. I told you I didn't
want anyone to know about this.

13:52.457 --> 13:54.824
Now I'm not only
losing my company,

13:54.917 --> 13:57.500
but you gave the son of
a bitch responsible for it

13:57.587 --> 14:00.420
the satisfaction of knowing
what it's done to me.

14:00.506 --> 14:01.871
Esther, I know I screwed up.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.000
But I was in there and
he had us and he knew it,

14:05.094 --> 14:06.084
and I just snapped.

14:06.179 --> 14:09.297
But we can still get this son of
a bitch if you just come forward.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.425
What did you just say?

14:10.516 --> 14:13.053
I should've insisted this was the
way to handle this in the first place.

14:13.144 --> 14:15.135
You need to let
the world know what he did.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.266
I told you
I am not doing that.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.268
God damn it. How could
you give him the satisfaction

14:19.359 --> 14:20.599
of getting away with this?

14:20.693 --> 14:23.230
Because he will get away
with it, and I have children.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.483
And what happens when they
ask why I went to his hotel room?

14:25.573 --> 14:27.155
Why did you go
to his hotel room?

14:27.241 --> 14:30.029
Because I'd known him for years,
and we'd traveled together 50 times,

14:30.119 --> 14:31.575
and I never thought
he could do that.

14:31.662 --> 14:32.652
Well, then say that.

14:32.747 --> 14:34.533
How many times
do I have to tell you?

14:34.624 --> 14:36.740
I don't want them
to twist what I say

14:36.834 --> 14:37.869
and have it go
in the Journal,

14:37.960 --> 14:39.371
and have to put
my children through that...

14:39.462 --> 14:41.078
Esther, don't...
That's enough.

14:41.172 --> 14:45.382
I came to you to protect me,
like I protected you

14:45.468 --> 14:47.550
a thousand times
when we were kids.

14:47.678 --> 14:50.511
And I was dumb enough to think
that, with a baby on the way,

14:50.598 --> 14:54.182
you might finally understand
when something matters to me.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.052
But you don't.

15:00.358 --> 15:03.396
So leave this alone
and leave me alone.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.322
CHARLES: Harvey Specter.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.578
Long time no see.

15:19.669 --> 15:22.161
Sorry it's past
your bedtime, Charles.

15:22.255 --> 15:25.464
Then again, beauty sleep
ain't fixing that.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.416
What the hell
are you doing here?

15:27.510 --> 15:30.548
You know why I'm here.
William Sutter.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.094
Never heard of him.
That's funny.

15:32.181 --> 15:35.299
Because he transferred in here
the last six months of his sentence,

15:35.393 --> 15:37.304
and then you became
an informant for Andrew Malik.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.394
Oh, that William Sutter.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.475
What about him?

15:41.566 --> 15:43.352
I want you to admit
you set this whole thing up.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.478
All right.

15:44.569 --> 15:47.527
Nobody in prison ever admits
to what they've done,

15:47.613 --> 15:49.524
but Sutter did.

15:49.615 --> 15:52.198
Because he knew he was dying.
That's right.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.401
He told me some asshole
sold him out.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.287
And wouldn't you know it?

15:58.624 --> 16:00.740
That asshole
turned out to be you.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.291
Took me awhile
to figure out

16:02.378 --> 16:04.870
that you and Cahill were
in on it, but once I did...

16:05.548 --> 16:07.334
I started looking around
for somebody

16:07.425 --> 16:09.416
who hates you
as much as I do.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.547
So, yeah, I did this.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.051
What you gonna
do about it?

16:16.851 --> 16:17.841
Not a thing.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.055
Because when I win,

16:20.146 --> 16:22.638
whatever deal you cut
with Malik is gone.

16:22.732 --> 16:26.441
Then again, if you said
you made this whole story up,

16:27.195 --> 16:29.687
Cahill might just cut
your sentence in half.

16:30.406 --> 16:33.148
So you need to ask yourself
who's coming out on top,

16:34.202 --> 16:36.819
Malik or me?

16:36.913 --> 16:38.654
The side that I am on

16:41.167 --> 16:44.376
is always gonna be
the side that's against you.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.129
Louis.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.258
How much did you hear?
Enough.

17:00.728 --> 17:04.266
I wanted to tell you what was
really going on, Katrina. I just couldn't.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.646
I understand, Louis.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.688
But what I think
you may not be understanding

17:09.779 --> 17:14.114
is that right now, Esther
isn't just feeling angry.

17:14.784 --> 17:18.573
She's feeling powerless
and ashamed.

17:18.663 --> 17:21.496
But she has the power.
To do what?

17:21.582 --> 17:24.199
She can't put him in prison.
It was too long ago.

17:24.292 --> 17:26.204
Make him feel like
what he did was wrong?

17:26.295 --> 17:27.705
That's never going to happen.

17:27.797 --> 17:30.585
Louis, what Esther wants
is for us to find a way

17:30.675 --> 17:33.383
to stop this
without telling anyone.

17:33.469 --> 17:34.709
Well, then let's do that.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.340
Faye won't let you take
your sister as a client.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.012
Bullshit.
She's already a client.

17:38.099 --> 17:40.181
No, the company
is our client,

17:40.268 --> 17:42.430
and the board
wants this merger.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.555
Esther doesn't.

17:44.355 --> 17:45.686
What are you saying?

17:45.773 --> 17:47.059
I'm saying we need help.

17:51.237 --> 17:54.150
Sean, tell me you got Malik's
boss to call off the dogs.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.698
Call off the dogs? I haven't
even gotten to him yet.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.616
What are you waiting for?
An engraved invitation?

17:58.703 --> 18:00.569
I can't just put pressure
on a man I haven't met with

18:00.663 --> 18:02.199
without having someone
soften him up first.

18:02.290 --> 18:05.533
And being under indictment isn't
the best time to be calling in IOUs.

18:05.626 --> 18:06.866
Screw the timing.

18:06.961 --> 18:09.498
Sean, you need to have
those calls made tonight.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.250
Harvey, what happened
with Forstman?

18:11.340 --> 18:13.581
He didn't go for it,
and Kevin won't recant,

18:13.676 --> 18:15.883
which means if you don't
make this thing go away,

18:15.970 --> 18:19.304
we're going to trial staring down
the barrel of a loaded shotgun.

18:19.390 --> 18:20.471
So get it done.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.012
All right, Sean,
what's this about?

18:24.103 --> 18:25.218
Because you're on leave,

18:25.313 --> 18:27.099
and I shouldn't
even let you in here.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.554
I need a favor.

18:28.649 --> 18:31.892
If it has anything to do with
your case, I can't help you.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.686
I need you to go to
Andrew Malik's boss's office

18:34.780 --> 18:36.362
and read him
the riot act anyway.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.689
About what?
Tell him it's nothing more

18:37.783 --> 18:39.694
than a personal attack
against Harvey Specter.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.493
And when he tells me I'm full of
shit and I've got no proof, then what?

18:42.580 --> 18:43.615
Tell him
to check the record.

18:43.706 --> 18:46.164
Malik hated Harvey. He
went after him three times.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.708
And if that's not enough, if
Malik's not hiding a grudge,

18:48.794 --> 18:50.660
why the hell
didn't he go after Harvey?

18:51.297 --> 18:53.163
Okay, I'll do it.

18:53.674 --> 18:56.382
But, Sean, did it ever
occur to you that the person

18:56.469 --> 18:58.710
who put you in this position
isn't Andrew Malik?

18:59.388 --> 19:01.174
It's Harvey Specter.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.553
Donna Paulsen.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.517
I should have guessed Harvey
would send you here.

19:10.608 --> 19:11.894
He didn't send me anywhere.

19:11.984 --> 19:15.477
In fact, I'm putting my feelings
about you aside to try to end this thing.

19:15.571 --> 19:16.811
Oh, this ought to be good.

19:16.906 --> 19:18.488
Go ahead. Give me
your song and dance.

19:18.574 --> 19:19.814
It's not a song and dance.

19:19.909 --> 19:22.571
This thing that you have with
Harvey, it's consuming you.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.370
And if you don't figure out a way
to let it go, it is not gonna end well.

19:25.456 --> 19:26.571
First a threat.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.701
How about you
move on to begging?

19:27.792 --> 19:30.750
I'm not threatening you, Andy.
I'm warning you.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.827
You've come after Harvey
twice before.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.378
You lost and he let it go.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.422
Well, he's not gonna
let it go this time.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.874
I'm not gonna lose.
Yes, you are,

19:37.968 --> 19:41.131
because you're not just fighting
Harvey. You're fighting all of us.

19:41.222 --> 19:42.678
I appreciate the warning.

19:42.765 --> 19:46.383
But you go home and you tell Harvey
that he better sleep well while he can.

19:46.477 --> 19:47.808
You're gonna have
to tell him that yourself.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.681
I'm not gonna
see Harvey tonight.

19:49.772 --> 19:51.558
He's too busy
kicking your ass.

19:57.154 --> 20:00.613
Samantha.
Glad you could make it.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.781
How you doing?

20:01.867 --> 20:03.028
I'm okay, Louis.

20:03.411 --> 20:05.027
But you sounded upset
on the phone,

20:05.121 --> 20:06.782
and I'm sure you didn't bring
me here to talk about me.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.954
So, what's going on?

20:09.041 --> 20:10.122
It's my sister.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.201
She's being forced out of her own
company by the man who assaulted her.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.457
And she begged me not
to confront him with it,

20:15.548 --> 20:17.380
but, of course, I did.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.753
Let me guess,
he's denying it.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.130
He is.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.803
And sure as we're sitting
here, if you go after him,

20:23.889 --> 20:26.130
he'll admit it happened,
but say it was her.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.260
How do you know that?

20:27.351 --> 20:28.557
Because I've seen
this movie before,

20:28.644 --> 20:30.976
which is why I know
he's made this movie before.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.604
Well, let me tell you
the movie I've seen.

20:33.691 --> 20:35.352
What you and I did
to my mugger.

20:35.443 --> 20:36.478
What are you saying?

20:36.569 --> 20:37.775
I'm saying that
I don't care

20:37.862 --> 20:39.819
if this guy has a family
or not, Samantha.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.281
You do whatever it takes to
take this piece of shit down.

20:57.673 --> 20:58.663
Can |I come in?

21:03.304 --> 21:04.294
(SIGHS)

21:04.388 --> 21:07.096
I always forget what
beautiful taste you have.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.516
Can I get you...
I'm sorry, Esther.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.853
You trusted me,
I didn't contain myself,

21:13.939 --> 21:15.100
and I am sorry.

21:15.733 --> 21:16.894
Thank you, Louis.

21:17.318 --> 21:18.308
Thing is,

21:19.487 --> 21:21.569
you hear about
this kind of thing happening,

21:21.655 --> 21:22.770
you know it does,

21:24.116 --> 21:26.357
but you always think
it happens to other people,

21:26.452 --> 21:27.863
not the people
that you love.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.990
And I do love you, Esther.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.241
I know that, Louis.

21:35.211 --> 21:36.417
I love you, too.

21:38.214 --> 21:41.377
It's funny, it seems like you
hear about this kind of thing now,

21:41.467 --> 21:43.378
but back then, you didn't.

21:43.969 --> 21:46.131
And you wondered,
was it your fault?

21:46.222 --> 21:48.554
Was it something
you did or said?

21:48.641 --> 21:49.631
It wasn't.

21:50.893 --> 21:52.930
I just wish you had
told me at the time.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.681
Maybe I should have.

21:54.772 --> 21:57.184
The truth was...
You were feeling ashamed.

21:59.443 --> 22:03.061
Listen, I didn't just
come here to apologize.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.941
I know you said
to leave this alone,

22:05.032 --> 22:06.898
and I'll call it off
if you want me to,

22:07.535 --> 22:09.025
but I went
to get us some help.

22:11.247 --> 22:12.328
Thank you, Louis.

22:17.127 --> 22:20.415
You think you can go over my head
and there won't be any consequences?

22:20.506 --> 22:23.089
I think you wouldn't be here if your
boss hadn't put the screws to you

22:23.175 --> 22:24.381
for coming after me.
You're right.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.584
He called me at midnight
in my home

22:26.679 --> 22:29.592
and said that if I had nothing to hide,
why the hell didn't I come after you?

22:29.682 --> 22:31.343
Well, you wanted it?
You got it.

22:31.433 --> 22:35.142
You are under arrest for
conspiring with a federal prosecutor.

22:35.229 --> 22:36.435
You're making
a mistake, Malik.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.388
What do you think the judge
is gonna say when he finds out

22:38.482 --> 22:39.768
you arrested
your opposing counsel?

22:39.859 --> 22:41.520
He's gonna say,
"Guilty as charged,"”

22:41.610 --> 22:44.443
because I'm not just gonna
disbar you. I'm putting you away.

22:45.239 --> 22:46.354
I wanna call my lawyer.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.110
(CELL PHONE CLATTERS)

22:52.872 --> 22:54.078

22:56.333 --> 22:57.744
I'll see you down there.

22:57.835 --> 23:00.122
We'll try to reach out
to your lawyer on the way.

23:10.264 --> 23:11.345
ANDREW: You hungry, Harvey?

23:11.974 --> 23:13.135
After I picked you up,

23:13.225 --> 23:15.637
I realized that you may
not have had breakfast yet.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.345
Well, since you're asking,
I'll have two eggs, a coffee,

23:18.439 --> 23:19.804
and a side of kiss my ass.

23:20.065 --> 23:21.055
Swagger, huh?

23:21.442 --> 23:22.932
But you're not fooling anyone

23:23.027 --> 23:25.769
because I know exactly
how screwed you are.

23:25.863 --> 23:28.195
What I know is,
I asked for my attorney,

23:28.282 --> 23:29.488
you smashed my phone,

23:29.575 --> 23:31.737
which means I could tell you
I killed Kennedy,

23:31.827 --> 23:32.908
and it wouldn't be admissible.

23:32.995 --> 23:35.487
Well, if you won't talk
to me, maybe Sean will.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.618
You know, we picked him up
right after you.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.540
You can't do that.
He's already been arrested.

23:39.627 --> 23:41.117
Not for obstruction,
he hasn't,

23:41.211 --> 23:45.580
which is exactly what happened
when his boss went to my boss.

23:45.674 --> 23:46.664
Oh, I get it.

23:46.759 --> 23:50.047
You concocted this little
prisoner's dilemma to get us to cave.

23:50.137 --> 23:52.344
Well, if you think
that's going to break us,

23:52.431 --> 23:53.637
you're wasting your time.

23:53.724 --> 23:56.557
I think Sean Cahill has one
chance to save his career,

23:56.644 --> 23:59.682
and all he has to do
is turn on you.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.228
Or you could turn first.

24:01.315 --> 24:02.305
Be my guest.

24:03.359 --> 24:04.724
In the meantime,

24:04.818 --> 24:07.480
I'm gonna go and see
if Sean feels any different.

24:08.697 --> 24:09.687
(DOOR CLOSES)

24:11.033 --> 24:12.944
Alex, I need to talk to you.

24:13.327 --> 24:15.443
Harvey and Sean were supposed
to talk strategy this morning,

24:15.537 --> 24:16.527
but they're not
in his office.

24:16.622 --> 24:17.657
You checked
the conference room?

24:17.748 --> 24:19.034
I did, and after that,
reception,

24:19.124 --> 24:20.785
and it turns out neither
of them showed up.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.787
And when I call Harvey, it
goes straight to voice mail.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.619
Donna, they probably
had the meeting over coffee

24:24.713 --> 24:25.703
and didn't wanna
be disturbed.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.880
Alex, I don't get
this feeling very often,

24:27.967 --> 24:29.878
and you don't know Andy Malik
like I do.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.585
I'm telling you
something's wrong.

24:33.931 --> 24:35.513
All right,
let's get to it, Sean.

24:36.266 --> 24:38.303
I know you did this.
I know why.

24:38.394 --> 24:40.135
You owed Harvey Specter
your career.

24:40.229 --> 24:41.560
The hell I do.

24:41.647 --> 24:43.854
You're gonna tell me that he
didn't take down Eric Woodall,

24:43.941 --> 24:45.227
which put you in your job,

24:45.317 --> 24:47.149
and that's why he got
his buddy out of prison?

24:47.236 --> 24:48.522
Those things are unrelated.
Wow.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.273
That'd be the first time in
history that both hands are clean

24:50.364 --> 24:51.479
and one didn't
wash the other.

24:51.573 --> 24:52.563
You need to
get your facts straight,

24:52.658 --> 24:54.444
because the deal that I made
to take down William Sutter...

24:54.535 --> 24:56.025
Was with Mike Ross,
not me.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.531
Then why did you pursue
Sutter as a client?

24:57.621 --> 25:00.579
His son-in-law, Kevin Miller,
got Mike Ross out of a jam.

25:00.666 --> 25:01.906
I owed him one.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.833
And Kevin Miller
says that's a lie.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.661
And that's the coerced
testimony of a convicted felon.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.041
You think that's all I got?

25:09.550 --> 25:10.540
Phone records.

25:10.634 --> 25:13.672
Two dozen conversations between
you and Sean during that time.

25:13.762 --> 25:14.923
How do you explain that?

25:15.014 --> 25:16.470
Frank Gallo was in there.

25:16.557 --> 25:19.299
He was a danger to Mike
Ross, so I called Sean.

25:19.393 --> 25:20.975
Bullshit. You want to
get an inmate moved,

25:21.061 --> 25:23.223
you talk to the warden,
not an SEC prosecutor.

25:23.313 --> 25:24.599
Mike's life
was threatened.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.476
I was talking to anyone
who'd listen.

25:26.567 --> 25:28.478
Bullshit again.
Mike Ross was in danger,

25:28.569 --> 25:30.731
you couldn't get Gallo moved, so
you had to get Mike out of there.

25:30.821 --> 25:32.528
And that's when you went to
your buddy Sean and made a deal,

25:32.614 --> 25:34.230
which he took
because he owed you.

25:34.324 --> 25:36.156
I didn't fucking deal.
Yes, you did.

25:36.243 --> 25:37.358
I know the whole story.

25:37.453 --> 25:40.070
I can tell it, I can prove I,
and a jury's gonna believe it.

25:40.164 --> 25:41.495
The real question is,

25:42.082 --> 25:44.949
which one of you two is
gonna figure that out first?

25:45.169 --> 25:46.284
Not me.

25:46.712 --> 25:48.544
Look at his track record.

25:48.630 --> 25:50.212
Mike Ross went to prison
for him.

25:50.299 --> 25:51.789
Jessica Pearson
lost her license for him.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.545
He manipulates people.

25:53.635 --> 25:54.921
I didn't manipulate anyone.

25:55.012 --> 25:56.969
You manipulated the law.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.717
You crossed the line
at every turn.

25:58.807 --> 26:00.343
You think the rules
don't apply to you.

26:00.434 --> 26:01.765
I'm good with who I am.

26:01.852 --> 26:03.138
That's the fucking problem.

26:03.937 --> 26:06.975
You pursued a client
with the sole purpose

26:07.066 --> 26:08.773
of putting him away.

26:09.109 --> 26:12.818
You did it, you know it,
and you don't even care.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.029
Sean,

26:16.116 --> 26:18.778
do you know what happens to
prosecutors who go to prison?

26:20.329 --> 26:21.785
This is your last chance.

26:22.956 --> 26:25.573
Now you won't go to trial.
You won't lose your job.

26:25.667 --> 26:28.625
All you have to do
is admit the truth

26:29.171 --> 26:30.787
and this will all be over.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.205
It is over, Malik.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.960
My clients are done
answering questions.

26:34.051 --> 26:35.416
Yeah, well,
I'm done asking.

26:35.511 --> 26:38.344
Oh, and you don't have clients,
Mr. Williams. You just have him.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.841
What the hell
does that mean?

26:39.932 --> 26:42.264
It means Sean Cahill asked
for new representation.

26:42.351 --> 26:44.058
Who?
Faye Richardson.

26:44.978 --> 26:47.015
She advised her client
to take my deal,

26:47.689 --> 26:48.770
and he agreed.

27:04.748 --> 27:05.738
(CHUCKLES)

27:05.999 --> 27:07.865
First Harvey, then Louis.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.201
I'm seeing you people more
than I did when I was at the firm.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.410
Speaking of the firm,

27:11.505 --> 27:13.712
I know Louis came to you
for help with Esther.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.589
Whatever you're doing,
I want in.

27:16.260 --> 27:18.251
Katrina, don't take this
the wrong way,

27:18.345 --> 27:19.881
but go back to work.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.087
I'm not going anywhere.

27:21.181 --> 27:23.047
Then don't, but the reason
he came to me

27:23.142 --> 27:25.509
is because I am doing things
you can't.

27:25.602 --> 27:28.890
Samantha, I was a prosecutor
for six years before I got to the firm.

27:29.273 --> 27:30.684
One day, a woman came in,

27:30.774 --> 27:32.606
said she'd been assaulted
by her boss.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.309
Let me guess,
nobody believed her.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.857
No. Everyone believed her.

27:37.739 --> 27:39.901
I threw everything I had
at this guy.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.984
I put her on the stand,
she told her story,

27:43.829 --> 27:48.289
and then I had to watch as 12
jurors exonerated that bastard.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.582
So if you're going
after this guy,

27:51.003 --> 27:52.664
you're not doing it
without me.

27:57.384 --> 27:58.966
Harvey, before
you say anything...

27:59.469 --> 28:00.459
(GROANS)

28:00.762 --> 28:02.844
Fuck you and the horse
you rode in on.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.012
You son of a bitch.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.386
He had us.
We were gonna lose.

28:06.476 --> 28:08.012
We were both gonna go
to prison, and I cut us a deal

28:08.103 --> 28:09.593
so neither of us
would have to.

28:09.688 --> 28:10.849
What do you want, Sean?

28:10.939 --> 28:12.725
Do you want me to throw
you a ticker-tape parade?

28:12.816 --> 28:15.399
I don't give a shit what you
throw me. You did what he said.

28:15.485 --> 28:17.271
You went after a guy,
made him trust you,

28:17.362 --> 28:18.818
and you threw him in prison
for the rest of his life,

28:18.906 --> 28:20.362
and you didn't lose
a minute's sleep over it.

28:20.449 --> 28:21.985
Yeah, he threw that
at me, too.

28:22.075 --> 28:25.193
I'm just a piece of shit
who only cares about himself.

28:25.287 --> 28:26.777
And, yeah, I colluded.

28:26.997 --> 28:29.864
But I did it to get a man
who never hurt a soul

28:29.958 --> 28:33.201
away from a convicted murderer
who was gonna kill him.

28:33.337 --> 28:34.919
That doesn't change the... No,
let me tell you something else.

28:35.005 --> 28:37.463
My whole life, I have done
what I think is right,

28:37.549 --> 28:40.211
but there's always someone
somewhere who hates me for it

28:40.302 --> 28:42.293
because they think
I'm breaking the rules.

28:42.387 --> 28:44.879
Well, rules aren't
right or wrong.

28:46.600 --> 28:49.433
Every line I've ever crossed,
I'd do it again

28:49.519 --> 28:52.307
because I am fine
with what's in my soul.

28:54.107 --> 28:56.348
Look, Harvey, I didn't say
you were the bad guy.

28:56.777 --> 28:57.938
I just said he had us.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.732
Well, you know what, Sean?
Now he only has me.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.531
How could you do it?

29:09.456 --> 29:11.493
How could you
betray Harvey like that?

29:11.583 --> 29:13.324
I didn't betray anyone.
Bullshit!

29:13.418 --> 29:14.408
You went to Sean

29:14.503 --> 29:16.585
and you helped him cut a deal
to get Harvey disbarred.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.254
He decided
to take a deal, Donna,

29:18.340 --> 29:20.581
and when he did,
Andrew Malik recommended me

29:20.676 --> 29:22.713
because Sean had a right
to an attorney

29:22.803 --> 29:24.965
who was looking out
for his best interests.

29:25.055 --> 29:27.672
That, right there.
That's what you do.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.302
You hide behind morality

29:29.393 --> 29:31.976
when the truth is,
you just can't stand Harvey.

29:32.062 --> 29:33.177
I don't hate Harvey.

29:33.272 --> 29:36.105
In fact, I believe, in his heart,
he thinks he's a good man.

29:36.233 --> 29:37.769
That's why he won't change,

29:37.859 --> 29:39.520
and why he's a cancer
to this firm.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.022
You call him a cancer?

29:41.113 --> 29:43.024
Well, unlike you, Faye,
people love him.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.731
Which makes
the problem worse

29:45.117 --> 29:46.983
because you all
follow him anywhere.

29:47.202 --> 29:48.237
And if you think

29:48.328 --> 29:50.740
you'll always be able
to make him do what's right,

29:51.415 --> 29:52.576
you're kidding yourself.

29:52.666 --> 29:54.782
Well, you know what, Faye?
It was his moral code

29:54.876 --> 29:57.083
that kept him from
turning you over to the Bar

29:57.170 --> 29:58.285
when he had the chance.

29:58.380 --> 30:01.338
So next time you wanna
talk shit about who he is,

30:01.842 --> 30:03.424
you think about that.

30:10.934 --> 30:12.174
Six women over 10 years.

30:12.269 --> 30:14.556
The problem is none of
them are willing to talk.

30:14.646 --> 30:15.681
I can see why.

30:15.772 --> 30:18.355
Violating those NDAs is a
one-way ticket to bankruptcy.

30:18.442 --> 30:20.854
Only in civil court. The NDAs
don't apply if it's criminal.

30:20.944 --> 30:22.150
Then they'd have
to take the stand,

30:22.237 --> 30:24.228
and if Esther won't do it,
why would they?

30:24.698 --> 30:26.689
They won't. Damn it.

30:27.868 --> 30:29.529
All we need is one.

30:30.412 --> 30:31.527
Wait a second.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.913
What if we're looking at this
the wrong way?

30:35.000 --> 30:35.990
What do you mean?

30:36.084 --> 30:37.745
We can't ask
any of these women

30:37.836 --> 30:39.827
to risk their life savings
to come forward,

30:39.921 --> 30:43.664
but the people who arranged
those NDAs are a different story.

30:43.759 --> 30:45.591
They already risked
their life savings

30:45.677 --> 30:47.463
because they took part
in a cover-up.

30:47.554 --> 30:49.716
Katrina, they're Paul's lawyers.
They have attorney-client privilege.

30:49.806 --> 30:51.092
That's the thing, Samantha.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.140
Their client
isn't Paul Richmond.

30:53.435 --> 30:54.721
It's the company.

30:54.936 --> 30:57.894
And if they took action which
gives their company exposure...

30:58.231 --> 30:59.517
They have liability, too.

30:59.608 --> 31:00.894
It's a stretch.

31:01.318 --> 31:03.229
Whoever it is
won't just cave.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.607
Unless there's more than one,
in which case...

31:05.697 --> 31:07.313
We pit one
against the other.

31:19.753 --> 31:22.040
Ms. Bennett, you said
you wanted to talk about

31:22.130 --> 31:24.087
a business opportunity?
That's right.

31:24.174 --> 31:26.791
I'm offering you a chance to
cut ties with Paul Richmond

31:26.885 --> 31:28.000
before it's too late.

31:28.136 --> 31:30.548
Why would I cut ties
with Paul? You know why.

31:30.639 --> 31:32.425
Because you were party
to buying the silence

31:32.516 --> 31:33.972
of the women he assaulted.

31:34.059 --> 31:36.175
If Paul Richmond assaulted
anyone, I never heard about it.

31:36.269 --> 31:38.727
You never heard of Maya Perez
or Janet Tundermann

31:38.814 --> 31:40.145
or any of these other women?

31:40.232 --> 31:41.814
I deal with hundreds of
employees, Ms. Wheeler.

31:41.900 --> 31:42.935
I don't remember every one.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.482
Then let me jog your memory.

31:44.611 --> 31:48.149
You cut them bonus checks worth
10 times what they were earning.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.024
Not only that, every single
one of those deals

31:51.118 --> 31:53.701
came with strings attached,
and we know what they are.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.027
NDAsS.

31:55.122 --> 31:57.830
Because those payouts weren't
released until the truth was buried,

31:57.916 --> 31:59.998
and you're one of the people
holding the shovel.

32:00.085 --> 32:01.541
This conversation is over.
SAMANTHA: Maybe it is.

32:01.628 --> 32:03.585
But you might want to
check your contract.

32:04.214 --> 32:06.956
It says you work for
the company, not Paul.

32:07.050 --> 32:10.168
Which means any arrangements
you made against Mayfield's interests

32:10.262 --> 32:11.252
are not protected...

32:11.346 --> 32:12.757
KATRINA:
By attorney-client privilege.

32:13.056 --> 32:16.219
So the question is,
who's going to talk first?

32:19.396 --> 32:20.386
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

32:22.983 --> 32:24.815
Were you gonna
tell me about Cahill?

32:24.901 --> 32:27.359
Or was I supposed to read
about it in the Journal?

32:27.446 --> 32:29.938
I'm sorry, Donna, I didn't
have it in me to tell you.

32:30.031 --> 32:31.066
I get it.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.236
You were loyal to Sean,

32:34.369 --> 32:35.700
and it was a gut punch.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.869
Now Malik's finally
gonna get what he wants.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.323
Cahill and Faye
are taking that plea deal,

32:40.417 --> 32:41.907
and I'm gonna
lose my license.

32:42.002 --> 32:44.915
And the Harvey I know wouldn't give
up until they yanked him out of here.

32:45.005 --> 32:46.587
And that's gonna
happen tomorrow

32:46.673 --> 32:49.040
because as soon as
Cahill signs that thing,

32:49.134 --> 32:50.465
Malik's got me.

32:50.552 --> 32:51.542
ALEX: No, he doesn't.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.468
And if I'm right,
he's not going to.

32:53.555 --> 32:54.590
What are you saying?

32:54.681 --> 32:57.389
After I bailed Harvey out,
I pulled the arrest warrant.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.387
Turns out, the time on it
was 9:00 p.m.,

32:59.478 --> 33:01.685
two hours before
Cahill's boss went to Malik's.

33:01.771 --> 33:03.853
And exactly one hour
after I saw Forstman.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.932
Shit, he didn't arrest me
because Cahill went over his head.

33:07.027 --> 33:09.894
He did it because he knew I
was getting close to something.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.070
Which leads me to this.
Sutter's autopsy.

33:12.157 --> 33:13.488
He didn't know
he was dying.

33:13.575 --> 33:15.065
He died of a heart attack
on the spot.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.322
Which means Forstman
wasn't telling the truth.

33:17.412 --> 33:18.948
But he was
telling the truth.

33:19.039 --> 33:20.700
He had to have gotten
the story from Sutter.

33:20.790 --> 33:22.121
Otherwise, how did he know?

33:22.209 --> 33:23.415
See, that's the thing.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.994
He wasn't lying about
what Sutter told him.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.623
He was lying about when.

33:27.714 --> 33:31.002
Malik's whole case hinges
on Forstman's testimony.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.296
And in order for it
to be admissible,

33:33.386 --> 33:35.047
it had to be
a deathbed confession.

33:35.138 --> 33:37.596
And you can't give a deathbed
confession without a deathbed.

33:37.682 --> 33:40.014
Which means Sutter
must've told Forstman,

33:40.101 --> 33:42.513
but Forstman didn't put it
together about Cahill

33:42.604 --> 33:43.639
until it was too late.

33:43.730 --> 33:45.437
So this means
you're off the hook.

33:45.774 --> 33:46.935
We've got proof.

33:47.025 --> 33:50.814
Maybe, but I don't just want
proof that Forstman was lying.

33:51.446 --> 33:53.187
I want proof
that Malik knew.

33:53.281 --> 33:54.567
How are we
gonna get that?

33:54.908 --> 33:57.821
By giving Sean Cahill
a chance to make things right.

34:02.707 --> 34:03.697
Samantha.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.908
I hope you don't mind.
Sheila let me in.

34:06.002 --> 34:07.788
No, of course not.
What do you got?

34:07.879 --> 34:09.620
Good news
and bad news, Louis.

34:09.965 --> 34:12.706
We have a road map to every
time Paul has done this before

34:12.801 --> 34:14.337
and the settlements
he's paid.

34:14.427 --> 34:16.839
The thing is, we still
don't have a plaintiff.

34:17.556 --> 34:20.014
And without a plaintiff,
the best I can do is bluff.

34:20.100 --> 34:21.431
That's what
I'm here to say.

34:21.518 --> 34:23.976
You'll have to convince
your sister to come forward.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.302
No, Samantha, I can't.

34:25.730 --> 34:28.313
She doesn't want to do it,
and I can't ask her again.

34:29.317 --> 34:30.773
Then I think I know who can.

34:40.328 --> 34:41.318
ESTHER: Katrina?

34:41.413 --> 34:43.745
I got your message.
I came as soon as I could.

34:43.831 --> 34:45.368
Esther, please sit.

34:46.083 --> 34:47.824
I know we've only met
once or twice,

34:47.918 --> 34:51.128
but I'm going to have to be direct
because we don't have much time.

34:51.214 --> 34:54.172
We were able to find
a substantial amount

34:54.259 --> 34:57.047
of evidence against Paul
throughout his career.

34:57.137 --> 34:58.127
But?

34:58.221 --> 35:00.713
But without someone
willing to come forward,

35:01.224 --> 35:02.760
you're going to
lose your company

35:02.851 --> 35:05.013
and he's going to
keep doing this.

35:05.729 --> 35:06.719
I see.

35:06.813 --> 35:09.601
Before you say anything,
I want you to know two things.

35:09.691 --> 35:13.559
I once took up this fight for
someone in your situation.

35:15.155 --> 35:16.145
And we lost.

35:16.489 --> 35:19.777
I called her today, asked if
she regretted coming forward,

35:19.868 --> 35:21.154
and she said that,

35:21.620 --> 35:24.078
while living with
that verdict was hard,

35:25.123 --> 35:28.457
not having said anything
would have been harder.

35:30.629 --> 35:31.869
And the other thing?

35:32.130 --> 35:33.541
That case
was nine years ago,

35:33.715 --> 35:36.628
and, Esther,
times have changed.

35:37.761 --> 35:39.718
I'm not so sure they have.

35:41.681 --> 35:43.513
Obviously, this is
your decision.

35:44.017 --> 35:45.473
But, as I said,

35:46.102 --> 35:47.467
we don't have much time.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.058
ANDREW: What the hell
is this?

35:55.779 --> 35:57.520
Where's Faye?
Faye's not coming

35:57.614 --> 35:59.400
'cause Sean's
not signing your deal.

35:59.491 --> 36:00.606
Well, then, I guess
we're going to court.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.282
No, Malik,
you're going to court

36:02.369 --> 36:04.701
because we didn't conspire
with a convicted felon,

36:04.788 --> 36:05.778
you did.

36:05.872 --> 36:07.362
The hell
are you talking about?

36:07.457 --> 36:09.744
He's talking about the fact
that Charles Forstman

36:09.834 --> 36:11.575
lied about the timing
of Sutter's confession.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.126
And you're the one
who told him to do it.

36:13.213 --> 36:14.248
I can't believe this.

36:14.339 --> 36:15.921
You can't see
what's happening here?

36:16.007 --> 36:17.372
He's spinning you.
That's what he does.

36:17.467 --> 36:18.753
You call this spin, Andy?

36:19.302 --> 36:20.463
I call it evidence.

36:20.595 --> 36:23.007
You pulled my records,
I pulled yours.

36:23.098 --> 36:25.055
All your contacts
with Charles Forstman.

36:25.141 --> 36:26.222
Every single one.

36:26.309 --> 36:28.141
Including the phone call
he made to you

36:28.228 --> 36:29.764
five minutes
after I left him,

36:29.854 --> 36:31.470
warning you
we were getting close.

36:31.564 --> 36:33.396
Not to mention the deal
that you cut with him

36:33.483 --> 36:35.315
three months
after Sutter died.

36:35.402 --> 36:37.234
HARVEY: And there is no record
of any contact

36:37.320 --> 36:39.607
between you and Charles
Forstman before that.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.814
You think you can intimidate
me into dropping this?

36:41.908 --> 36:43.319
No, Andy, I don't.

36:43.535 --> 36:44.821
And we're not intimidating.

36:45.078 --> 36:46.239
SEAN: We're arresting.

36:46.329 --> 36:48.536
You're hereby charged
with fabricating evidence

36:48.623 --> 36:49.613
in a criminal case.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.949
The hell I am. I'm the
goddamn state's attorney.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.283
No, you're not.

36:53.712 --> 36:57.171
See, Donna told you this
would happen, and now it is.

36:57.382 --> 37:00.545
Remember what you said about
prosecutors who go to prison, Andy?

37:00.635 --> 37:02.171
Well, you're about
to find out.

37:02.262 --> 37:03.502
You're not going to
get away with this.

37:03.596 --> 37:04.631
We just did.

37:05.932 --> 37:07.172
That was close.

37:07.684 --> 37:10.597
I guess it's a good thing
we stuck together till the end.

37:11.146 --> 37:13.558
Sean, I understand
why you did what you did.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.222
You do?

37:15.316 --> 37:17.523
I'm always saying
loyalty is a two-way street.

37:17.610 --> 37:20.022
If I can't see that you
were trying to do the best

37:20.113 --> 37:22.821
for both of us,
then I'm an asshole.

37:22.907 --> 37:24.363
You said it, not me.

37:24.617 --> 37:26.324
Bet you know what
I'm gonna say now, huh?

37:26.411 --> 37:28.197
Something about you never
wanting to see my face again?

37:28.288 --> 37:29.323
Something like that.

37:29.581 --> 37:30.571
Wanna grab a beer?

37:30.665 --> 37:31.871
Let me take a rain check.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.494
I've got a little errand
to run.

37:34.461 --> 37:35.451
Go get him, Harvey.

37:40.008 --> 37:43.046
I assume you're here to sign
the deal on behalf of your client?

37:43.136 --> 37:44.501
I'm here
to end this thing.

37:45.096 --> 37:48.088
And what are you going to
accuse me of this time, hmm?

37:48.975 --> 37:50.215
Robbing Fort Knox?

37:50.310 --> 37:51.596
Here's the thing, Paul.

37:51.686 --> 37:52.926
We went to
two of your people,

37:53.021 --> 37:55.683
gave them the choice
between saving your ass

37:55.940 --> 37:57.396
or saving themselves.

37:57.567 --> 37:59.524
Take a guess
whose ass they didn't save.

38:01.654 --> 38:05.147
Every NDA, every dirty
deal, every single cover-up.

38:05.241 --> 38:09.451
This is nothing but proof that these
women signed confidentiality agreements.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.495
Doesn't mean
what they're saying is true.

38:12.582 --> 38:14.323
We'll see what your board
has to say about that.

38:14.417 --> 38:15.782
I don't think the board's
gonna say anything.

38:15.877 --> 38:17.242
You know why they won't?

38:17.504 --> 38:19.165
"Cause Esther
won't come forward.

38:19.589 --> 38:21.421
No one comes forward,
you got nothing.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.290
ESTHER: No, Paul.

38:24.093 --> 38:25.800
He has everything.

38:29.015 --> 38:31.177
You know why I wasn't
gonna come forward?

38:32.310 --> 38:34.847
Because I didn't think
people would believe me.

38:35.897 --> 38:37.763
But when I tell my story,

38:38.483 --> 38:40.269
you can bet your ass

38:40.360 --> 38:42.647
I am gonna
make them believe me.

38:42.904 --> 38:45.896
Even if they do, it's long
past the statute of limitations.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.572
Not to sue your ass,
it isn't.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.241
Which is why
you're gonna resign.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.989
And if you don't,
I am gonna tell the world

38:52.372 --> 38:54.033
how, when I was
28 years old,

38:54.123 --> 38:58.538
you lured me to your room,
put your hands all over me,

38:58.628 --> 39:01.416
and when I resisted,
you overpowered me.

39:01.506 --> 39:02.962
And when
I finally got away,

39:03.049 --> 39:05.416
you told me
if I ever said a word,

39:05.510 --> 39:07.547
that I would
never work again.

39:07.637 --> 39:09.503
And when she's done, they're
not gonna throw you in prison,

39:09.597 --> 39:11.884
but they're gonna take away
every penny you have.

39:13.101 --> 39:14.091
Sign.

39:24.153 --> 39:27.066
Now get the fuck out of here
before we change our minds.

(SOFTLY) I am.

39:37.417 --> 39:39.203
I didn't know
you were gonna show up.

39:39.294 --> 39:40.329
Neither did |I.

39:41.671 --> 39:43.662
I couldn't have done that
without you.

40:02.859 --> 40:05.146
I'm not cutting a deal
with Sean Cahill.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.726
I'm not here
for that, Charles.

40:06.821 --> 40:09.483
I'm here to tell you
that we know you lied,

40:09.574 --> 40:11.235
and we know
Malik was in on it.

40:11.326 --> 40:12.816
I don't know
what you're talking about.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.948
Then ask him,
because my guess is

40:15.204 --> 40:17.195
he'll be joining you here
in six months.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.616
I'll be out in two years.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.750
We'll see what happens then.

40:22.837 --> 40:24.327
There isn't going to be
a then.

40:24.422 --> 40:25.787
You perjured yourself,

40:26.507 --> 40:29.966
which means your time here
isn't going down, it's going up.

40:30.053 --> 40:32.385
Don't worry. The guy
who decides how much

40:33.264 --> 40:35.380
is Sean Cahill.

40:51.616 --> 40:52.947
Well, we didn't convict him,

40:53.034 --> 40:55.241
but short of that,
it went as well as possible.

40:55.328 --> 40:56.614
That's great, Louis.

40:56.704 --> 41:00.038
It feels weird to say that I'm
happy in a situation like this.

But I am.

we would have planned it, but...
