WEBVTT

00:03.048 --> 00:04.514
Attention.

00:04.516 --> 00:05.782
Attention!

00:05.784 --> 00:08.016
Okay, everybody look over at me now.

00:09.688 --> 00:12.255
Okay, that's as loud as
my voice goes, so I'm...

00:12.257 --> 00:14.590
I'm not sure what to do here.

00:15.593 --> 00:17.627
I would definitely kill a wolf.

00:18.530 --> 00:19.896
Oh, oh, oh. Okay. Okay.

00:19.898 --> 00:22.065
Today is a, uh, very exciting day,

00:22.067 --> 00:25.368
because "Stratus" is doing
a profile on our store.

00:25.370 --> 00:27.603
Yeah, ooh!

00:27.605 --> 00:30.039
Oh, yeah!

00:30.041 --> 00:31.307
What's "Stratus"?

00:31.309 --> 00:34.544
Um, only our internal
corporate magazine!

00:34.546 --> 00:36.779
"Magazine" isn't exactly accurate.

00:36.781 --> 00:39.515
It's more like misleading propaganda.

00:39.517 --> 00:40.850
No, it's not!

00:40.852 --> 00:43.152
"Minimum wage is maximum fun!"

00:43.154 --> 00:44.253
It is!

00:44.255 --> 00:47.256
A Guide to
Injuries on the Job."

00:47.258 --> 00:50.093
Oh, that is a super fun read.

00:50.095 --> 00:52.095
Ooh, there's a jingle-writing contest.

00:52.097 --> 00:53.496
Bo could enter that.

00:53.498 --> 00:56.299
If he won, he could stop
dancing for his mom's friends.

00:56.301 --> 01:00.136
It's my responsibility to
show the reporter around,

01:00.138 --> 01:03.773
so, please, let's put our
best foot forward, okay?

01:03.775 --> 01:05.507
Cheyenne, that means no falling asleep

01:05.510 --> 01:06.743
in the bedding department.

01:06.745 --> 01:09.112
I get tired, Glenn. I'm pregnant.

01:09.114 --> 01:10.513
Not today, you're not!

01:10.515 --> 01:11.748
Okay.

01:11.750 --> 01:14.117
Uh, oh, and Sal, I'm gonna need you

01:14.119 --> 01:18.154
to take the creepiness
down to about a two, okay?

01:18.156 --> 01:20.556
Garrett, um, I love those nicknames

01:20.558 --> 01:21.858
you come up with for me,

01:21.860 --> 01:24.327
but, uh, some people might
see them as insulting,

01:24.329 --> 01:27.764
so why don't you just get
'em out of your system now?

01:27.766 --> 01:29.665
Glennda, G-Nothing,

01:29.667 --> 01:30.833
Glenngarry Glenn Loss,

01:30.835 --> 01:32.035
Glennema,

01:32.037 --> 01:33.169
Glenntil Soup,

01:33.171 --> 01:34.137
TransGlennder.

01:34.139 --> 01:35.438
Oh, that's a new one.

01:35.440 --> 01:36.973
You got to keep this
reporter away from me.

01:36.975 --> 01:38.174
I hate reporters.

01:38.176 --> 01:40.143
My school paper once misidentified me

01:40.145 --> 01:42.045
as a scoliosis victim.

01:42.047 --> 01:45.481
I mean, the joke is, my
spine is perfect, okay?

01:45.483 --> 01:48.051
I can bench 160.

01:48.053 --> 01:49.952
165 in the right situation.

01:49.954 --> 01:51.220
Okay!

01:51.222 --> 01:53.589
Let's get out there and
have a newsworthy day.

01:53.591 --> 01:56.859
Do it for the old, uh...

01:56.861 --> 01:57.994
G-Spot!

01:57.996 --> 01:59.228
See?

01:59.230 --> 02:01.664
You're not the only one
who's good at nicknames.

02:06.404 --> 02:08.503
If you see the reporter show up today,

02:08.506 --> 02:10.006
please let me know so I can hide.

02:10.008 --> 02:11.641
I do not want them to
put me on the cover.

02:12.977 --> 02:14.444
That's pretty cocky.

02:14.446 --> 02:15.478
Oh, it's not ego.

02:15.480 --> 02:17.313
These corporate magazines love

02:17.315 --> 02:19.515
putting employees with
disabilities on the cover.

02:19.517 --> 02:20.983
Look.

02:20.985 --> 02:22.552
Wow.

02:22.554 --> 02:23.653
You were not kidding.

02:23.655 --> 02:25.088
And they really gonna come after me,

02:25.090 --> 02:27.123
especially with Face
Birthmark Tony on vacation.

02:27.125 --> 02:29.258
Yeah, I'll bet, and getting
a black guy in a wheelchair

02:29.260 --> 02:31.494
on the cover would be like
their Holy Grail or something.

02:31.496 --> 02:33.262
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:33.264 --> 02:35.465
You trying to say being
black's a disability?

02:35.467 --> 02:36.566
- Oh, no. No, no, no.
- Huh?

02:36.568 --> 02:37.967
Now, that's... no. No, of course, no.

02:37.969 --> 02:39.569
I... I have lots of... What?

02:39.571 --> 02:41.270
- I listen to Drake. I...
- Drake?

02:41.272 --> 02:45.074
No, no, no. I watch BET... sometimes.

02:45.076 --> 02:46.742
- I'm messing with you, dude.
- Okay.

02:46.744 --> 02:48.344
Good. Thank God.

02:48.346 --> 02:49.545
I've never watched BET.

02:49.547 --> 02:50.746
Yeah, me either, man.

02:55.353 --> 02:56.819
'Sup, fool?

02:56.821 --> 02:58.054
Nice.

02:58.056 --> 02:59.322
Why are you dressed like

02:59.324 --> 03:02.091
you're going undercover
at a high school?

03:02.093 --> 03:03.659
Oh.

03:03.661 --> 03:06.462
Well, it looked cool on him.

03:06.464 --> 03:08.831
With the reporter coming...

03:08.833 --> 03:11.501
I know I'm not the most
exciting person in the world,

03:11.503 --> 03:14.237
so I thought I'd jazz myself up a bit.

03:14.239 --> 03:15.605
Come on, Glenn.

03:15.607 --> 03:17.673
You're an exciting guy.

03:17.675 --> 03:20.943
You remember that time when, um,

03:20.945 --> 03:25.047
you know, uh...

03:25.049 --> 03:26.616
you know.

03:26.618 --> 03:28.151
Thanks for trying.

03:30.121 --> 03:34.056
Glenn, "Stratus" is just
a stupid corporate rag.

03:34.058 --> 03:35.625
Nobody reads that.

03:35.627 --> 03:37.827
I mean, maybe if the
break room TV is broken

03:37.829 --> 03:39.328
and I'm locked out of Candy Crush.

03:39.330 --> 03:40.897
I know that,

03:40.899 --> 03:44.333
but for once, it'd be
nice to be the star.

03:44.335 --> 03:47.203
I mean, I... I know I'm
never gonna be Madonna,

03:47.205 --> 03:51.174
but, for one day, it'd
be nice not to be Glenn,

03:51.176 --> 03:54.043
but to be... Glenn.

03:55.713 --> 03:58.347
Hey, I need you to help
me give Glenn a makeover.

03:58.349 --> 04:00.016
Which one of us was she talking to?

04:00.018 --> 04:01.751
Whichever one of you uses moisturizer.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:10.862 --> 04:13.062
You know, I have to say, almost
everything works on him.

04:13.064 --> 04:14.197
I guess that's the one benefit

04:14.199 --> 04:16.132
of having a face with zero character.

04:16.134 --> 04:17.567
Thank you, Mateo.

04:17.569 --> 04:19.101
You look good, Glenn.

04:19.103 --> 04:21.470
Just remember to maintain eye contact,

04:21.471 --> 04:23.339
give a good, firm handshake...

04:23.341 --> 04:25.374
Give compliments, and
try to make some jokes.

04:25.376 --> 04:26.576
And smile a lot.

04:26.578 --> 04:28.077
You'll be fine.

04:28.079 --> 04:29.845
Umm... hmm.

04:29.847 --> 04:31.814
Do you have something
you'd like to say, Jonah?

04:31.816 --> 04:34.250
A reporter doesn't care
about how you look.

04:34.252 --> 04:37.453
They want to hear your big ideas.

04:37.455 --> 04:38.454
Ideas?

04:38.456 --> 04:39.722
Okay. You know what?

04:39.724 --> 04:41.257
It's not "The New Yorker."

04:41.259 --> 04:42.325
It's "Stratus."

04:42.327 --> 04:44.927
They just want some nice photos

04:44.929 --> 04:48.297
and a quote saying how
great it is to work here.

04:48.299 --> 04:49.799
Jonah, I think Amy's right.

04:49.801 --> 04:51.500
I'm just gonna stick
with a firm handshake

04:51.502 --> 04:53.669
and an enthusiastic "Howdy-do!"

04:53.671 --> 04:54.770
Exactly.

04:54.772 --> 04:56.305
But don't say "howdy-do."

04:56.307 --> 04:57.573
Rodger dodger.

04:57.575 --> 04:59.875
* Cloud 9, Cloud 9 *

04:59.877 --> 05:01.310
* You better come inside *

05:01.312 --> 05:02.712
* Because it's hell outside *

05:02.714 --> 05:03.946
* I don't play by the rules *

05:03.948 --> 05:05.147
* Sending tanks to our schools *

05:05.149 --> 05:07.750
* Immigration, deportation *

05:07.752 --> 05:08.718
* Kneel, dog *

05:08.720 --> 05:09.685
* Rock the vote *

05:09.687 --> 05:10.820
* Fracking *

05:10.822 --> 05:13.055
* Campaign finance reform, bitches! *

05:14.092 --> 05:15.324
* Pew-pew-pew *

05:15.326 --> 05:16.325
What's up?

05:16.327 --> 05:17.493
That felt pretty good, right?

05:17.495 --> 05:18.761
That was great.

05:18.763 --> 05:20.296
A lot of fun stuff in there...

05:20.298 --> 05:21.430
Yeah.

05:21.432 --> 05:24.367
And I really love the
world of this rap.

05:24.369 --> 05:26.469
I just had, like, one thought.

05:26.471 --> 05:27.436
Okay.

05:27.438 --> 05:28.738
Not that I know anything,

05:28.740 --> 05:31.874
but it's a little bit, maybe, too...
political.

05:31.876 --> 05:34.443
I just can't think of any
other corporate jingles

05:34.445 --> 05:36.245
that say, "God is a black woman."

05:36.247 --> 05:37.213
Well, yeah.

05:37.215 --> 05:38.581
That's what makes it original, yo.

05:38.583 --> 05:39.949
Mm-hmm.

05:39.951 --> 05:42.752
I just think toning it down
might give us a better shot.

05:42.754 --> 05:45.221
We need money for the baby.

05:45.223 --> 05:47.390
Now, don't think of
it as "selling out."

05:47.392 --> 05:50.192
Think of it as "cashing in."

05:51.929 --> 05:53.863
That's why you're my manager.

05:55.300 --> 05:56.332
- Glenn.
- Mm?

05:56.334 --> 05:57.533
- Don't slump.
- Yeah.

05:57.535 --> 05:58.901
Accentuate your silhouette.

05:58.903 --> 06:02.638
Hand on hip, shoulders back,
look down on the world.

06:02.640 --> 06:04.173
Oh, she's here.

06:05.743 --> 06:06.742
Hey.

06:06.744 --> 06:08.544
Here's the deal, reporter.

06:08.546 --> 06:10.179
You're in my house now.

06:10.181 --> 06:11.681
You see those security cameras?

06:11.683 --> 06:14.283
I will have eyes on you...

06:14.285 --> 06:15.351
at all times.

06:17.689 --> 06:18.654
You understand what that means?

06:18.656 --> 06:19.755
Yeah, no. I got it.

06:21.893 --> 06:23.426
Oh.

06:23.428 --> 06:24.894
Hi. I'm from "Stratus."

06:24.896 --> 06:26.395
Yeah, I'm... I...

06:26.397 --> 06:27.530
I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name.

06:27.532 --> 06:28.664
I'm sorry. You...

06:28.666 --> 06:30.933
- How about you just...
- I'm sorry. You...

06:30.935 --> 06:32.568
- Okay, you talk.
- Okay, you talk. You talk.

06:32.570 --> 06:33.869
- You talk. You talk.
- Mm.

06:35.273 --> 06:36.238
Hi.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.740
I'm Amy. Hi.

06:37.742 --> 06:38.908
Welcome to the store.

06:38.910 --> 06:40.910
We're so glad to have
you here, Cynthia.

06:40.912 --> 06:42.044
Big fans of "Stratus."

06:42.046 --> 06:45.348
This is our store manager,
um, Glenn Sturgis.

06:45.350 --> 06:47.049
Hello. Welcome to meeting me.

06:47.051 --> 06:48.417
Oh.

06:51.789 --> 06:53.022
Oh.

06:53.024 --> 06:54.757
You're a pretty little
kitty, aren't you?

06:54.759 --> 06:56.425
What?

06:58.129 --> 07:00.162
Um, how about we start the tour?

07:00.164 --> 07:01.530
- Yeah.
- Yes.

07:01.532 --> 07:03.265
If you'll follow me, please.
Right this way.

07:03.267 --> 07:04.367
- Smile.
- What was that?

07:04.369 --> 07:05.434
Oh, smile!

07:05.436 --> 07:07.303
Oh, I wondered why...

07:09.974 --> 07:11.107
Hey!

07:12.810 --> 07:15.845
And, as I described to you
in the other three aisles,

07:15.847 --> 07:20.383
these are standard fluorescent
lights powered by...

07:20.385 --> 07:21.917
Wowzers, Glenn. That's a great quote.

07:21.919 --> 07:24.019
Let's maybe move on from
the lights now, okay?

07:24.021 --> 07:26.021
- How's he doing?
- Not so good.

07:26.023 --> 07:29.658
Between the fluorescent
lights is standard ceiling.

07:29.660 --> 07:31.394
Okay, so I know what's in the store

07:31.396 --> 07:33.195
'cause they're... pretty
much all identical,

07:33.197 --> 07:36.031
so can you tell me just something...
interesting?

07:36.033 --> 07:37.533
Hmm?

07:39.370 --> 07:42.738
Why don't you tell her about
one of your big ideas?

07:42.740 --> 07:44.340
- Huh?
- Okay. What big ideas?

07:44.342 --> 07:45.741
Yeah. What big ideas?

07:45.743 --> 07:48.310
Your idea to revamp the store.

07:48.312 --> 07:50.045
Shake things up a little bit.

07:50.047 --> 07:51.514
This guy, he doesn't want

07:51.516 --> 07:53.582
to just organize the
store by product type.

07:53.584 --> 07:57.052
He wants to organize the
store by lifestyle.

07:57.054 --> 08:00.389
There would be an aisle
for single moms,.

08:00.391 --> 08:02.057
There would be an aisle for veterans.

08:02.059 --> 08:03.993
That's actually...

08:03.995 --> 08:05.394
pretty cool.

08:05.396 --> 08:07.930
Oh, uh, yeah.

08:07.932 --> 08:09.765
No, Glenn has...

08:09.767 --> 08:12.668
all kinds of great ideas
just like that one.

08:12.670 --> 08:14.503
You do?

08:14.505 --> 08:16.572
Yes, I do.

08:16.574 --> 08:18.107
Here's another one.

08:24.081 --> 08:25.247
Framples!

08:25.249 --> 08:28.217
Instead of saying, "free samples,"

08:28.219 --> 08:30.019
we should just say, "framples."

08:30.021 --> 08:31.153
That's a good idea.

08:31.155 --> 08:32.688
- Yes.
- You should write that one down.

08:32.690 --> 08:33.823
No, I'm good.

08:33.825 --> 08:35.957
Well, I mean, it's not a bad idea.

08:36.861 --> 08:38.861
Wait, I have another one!

08:38.863 --> 08:39.962
"Shart."

08:39.964 --> 08:41.429
For "shopping cart."

08:41.432 --> 08:42.431
- Eh?
- Mm.

08:42.433 --> 08:43.532
Yep.

08:44.743 --> 08:47.287
I mean, you could also
have a green aisle

08:47.288 --> 08:50.969
put organic foods next to environmentally
friendly home products...

08:51.067 --> 08:52.300
I love that.

08:52.302 --> 08:53.268
Now, how do you spell your name?

08:53.270 --> 08:55.169
Oh, um, J-O-N...

08:56.706 --> 08:57.672
Oh. Uh, yeah.

08:57.674 --> 08:59.040
Honestly, I was just piggybacking

08:59.042 --> 09:00.308
off of Glenn's idea.

09:00.310 --> 09:01.676
Mm. Creative and humble.

09:01.678 --> 09:03.611
You're like... a regular Tom Hanks.

09:04.781 --> 09:06.180
- Hey, Cynthia.
- Yeah.

09:06.182 --> 09:08.182
Maybe you'd like to come see my office.

09:08.184 --> 09:09.450
It's pretty wild.

09:09.452 --> 09:12.353
I have a calendar in
there of normal dogs.

09:12.355 --> 09:13.421
Okay. That's great, Brian.

09:13.423 --> 09:15.256
But I'm talking to Jonah right now.

09:15.258 --> 09:16.958
So where'd you go to school? Oh...

09:16.960 --> 09:19.627
She doesn't even remember my name.

09:28.838 --> 09:30.171
Hi.

09:30.173 --> 09:32.941
Would you like to take a picture
for "Stratus" magazine?

09:32.943 --> 09:34.175
That sound fun?

09:34.177 --> 09:35.143
Hey!

09:35.145 --> 09:36.311
What are you, deaf?

09:37.881 --> 09:39.314
Oh, my God. He's deaf!

09:44.354 --> 09:45.320
Here you go.

09:45.322 --> 09:47.455
Have another "frample."

09:47.457 --> 09:48.523
Wow.

09:48.525 --> 09:50.158
See how that just
rolled off the tongue?

09:50.160 --> 09:51.125
Thanks, Amy.

09:51.127 --> 09:52.260
Why are you here?

09:52.262 --> 09:54.996
Because this is where the losers sit.

09:54.998 --> 09:56.230
Hey...

09:56.232 --> 09:57.699
Oh, I'm so sorry.

09:57.701 --> 10:01.769
Please, enjoy your individual
pepperoni pizza, okay?

10:01.771 --> 10:03.638
Glenn, I... I'm just
trying to help you.

10:03.640 --> 10:06.207
If you come back over with me,
I'll hand her off to you.

10:06.209 --> 10:07.408
It's no use!

10:07.410 --> 10:10.044
I don't have style or substance.

10:10.046 --> 10:11.779
Hey, maybe that's why iPhones

10:11.781 --> 10:14.082
never recognize my face as a face.

10:14.084 --> 10:15.817
Glenn, you're being hard on yourself.

10:15.819 --> 10:17.585
I've been here 20 years.

10:17.587 --> 10:18.820
You've been here two weeks,

10:18.822 --> 10:20.955
and you already have
better ideas than me.

10:20.957 --> 10:22.657
Glenn, that is not it.

10:22.659 --> 10:23.791
Honestly...

10:23.793 --> 10:26.127
I think that lady just
has a crush on Jonah.

10:26.129 --> 10:28.563
She's interested in him
because he's cute,

10:28.565 --> 10:30.365
not because of his bad ideas.

10:30.367 --> 10:32.033
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:32.035 --> 10:33.501
You think I'm cute?

10:33.503 --> 10:34.469
No!

10:34.471 --> 10:35.570
I do not think you're cute.

10:35.572 --> 10:37.338
I think you look like
a person who is cute.

10:38.408 --> 10:40.141
Wait; do you really think that's it?

10:40.143 --> 10:41.776
That she's just attracted to him?

10:41.778 --> 10:42.844
- No!
- Yes!

10:42.846 --> 10:43.978
Yes.

10:43.980 --> 10:46.080
You know, that kind of makes sense.

10:46.082 --> 10:49.484
I mean, I can't compete
with these geisha features.

10:49.486 --> 10:52.854
He looks like a panda and a
Disney princess had a baby.

10:52.856 --> 10:54.756
Thank you, Glenn, but I...
I do think it also might

10:54.758 --> 10:56.658
have something to do with my ideas.

10:56.660 --> 10:58.126
Aww.

10:58.128 --> 11:00.995
Da wittle panda finks
he fought of somefing.

11:02.132 --> 11:03.231
Okay.

11:03.233 --> 11:04.399
That's a little much.

11:04.401 --> 11:06.768
Look, now the panda's feeling sad!

11:06.770 --> 11:08.169
Aw, sad wittle panda!

11:08.171 --> 11:09.170
Aw, that's adorable.

11:09.172 --> 11:10.371
Tried to help.

11:10.373 --> 11:12.306
- Aw, panda!
- Sad panda...

11:12.308 --> 11:15.043
Aww, don't fwink we don't fwike you.

11:15.045 --> 11:17.912
* Cloud 9, come inside *

11:17.914 --> 11:20.548
* Society's a mirage
and sex is a prison *

11:20.550 --> 11:21.716
Uhh!

11:21.718 --> 11:23.217
Yeah, what do you think about that?

11:24.254 --> 11:27.321
I absolutely love the first half.

11:27.323 --> 11:29.857
I'm just not sure about
the second line.

11:29.859 --> 11:31.125
Are you serious?

11:31.127 --> 11:32.293
We've cut so much out.

11:32.295 --> 11:33.928
That's the only part left I even like.

11:33.930 --> 11:35.630
But the first line's
just a little bit more

11:35.632 --> 11:36.798
like a jingle, you know?

11:36.800 --> 11:37.965
It's catchy.

11:37.967 --> 11:38.933
Catchy?

11:38.935 --> 11:40.368
Nah, na-na-na-na-nah. Okay?

11:40.370 --> 11:42.303
That's not what my music's about, yo.

11:42.305 --> 11:43.838
It's been described as a lot of things,

11:43.840 --> 11:47.542
like edgy, dangerous,
terrible, but never catchy!

11:47.544 --> 11:48.843
That's not how I am.

11:48.845 --> 11:49.811
Forget this. I quit.

11:49.813 --> 11:50.978
I'm out of here. Uhh.

11:50.980 --> 11:52.814
Hey, look, okay?

11:52.816 --> 11:54.248
I get it. You don't want to sell out.

11:54.250 --> 11:55.516
That stinks.

11:55.518 --> 11:58.619
But a lot of this situation
we are in stinks.

11:58.621 --> 12:00.488
You think I want to be
wearing maternity clothes

12:00.490 --> 12:02.123
to high school, even
though I make it work,

12:02.125 --> 12:03.357
and I still look really cute?

12:03.359 --> 12:05.860
We have someone else
to think about now.

12:11.668 --> 12:14.635
Want to chug these cream sodas
like two really good bros?

12:14.637 --> 12:16.738
Ah, no thanks, Sal.

12:16.740 --> 12:19.240
Maybe I can get some
eggnog from up front.

12:19.242 --> 12:22.744
When you chug that, it feels
like you're drowning.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.247
- Oh, there you are.
- Oh!

12:26.249 --> 12:27.882
You ran off halfway through the tour.

12:27.884 --> 12:30.184
Yeah, I had to finish
some stuff back here.

12:30.186 --> 12:31.686
Uh, hey, listen.

12:31.688 --> 12:33.688
You should really talk to Glenn.

12:33.690 --> 12:35.423
I know he's kind of awkward,

12:35.425 --> 12:38.326
but he's, like, the heart
and soul of this place.

12:38.328 --> 12:39.961
Maybe you could show
me around back here.

12:39.963 --> 12:41.195
- Oh, back here?
- Yeah.

12:41.197 --> 12:42.864
There's not really
much to see back here.

12:42.866 --> 12:47.769
There's a water stain in the
shape of a crescent moon, so...

12:47.771 --> 12:49.337
um, I Instagrammed it.

12:49.339 --> 12:50.705
It's, uh, got seven likes.

12:50.707 --> 12:51.706
You're cute.

12:51.708 --> 12:52.774
You're cute.

12:52.776 --> 12:53.941
You're like a Jewish Kennedy.

12:53.943 --> 12:55.943
That's so... specific.

12:55.945 --> 12:57.645
Um, but...

12:57.647 --> 12:59.547
I'm not just cute, right?

12:59.549 --> 13:02.583
Like I... I'm not just
style over substance...

13:02.585 --> 13:04.018
Does it matter?

13:04.020 --> 13:05.720
It should.

13:05.722 --> 13:08.623
But you're really pretty,
and you smell like a pear.

13:24.485 --> 13:25.784
Hey, uh, can I ask you a question?

13:25.786 --> 13:27.886
Yeah, sure. What's going on?

13:27.888 --> 13:29.855
Uh, which of these headphones
would you recommend?

13:29.857 --> 13:31.690
Personally, I like those.

13:31.692 --> 13:33.825
They got Bluetooth
technology, which is great.

13:33.827 --> 13:35.227
Hey. What's up with that?

13:35.229 --> 13:36.928
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:36.930 --> 13:38.096
This has nothing to do with you.

13:38.098 --> 13:39.264
I'm just making this gesture

13:39.266 --> 13:41.500
to make sure any photo
of me is unusable.

13:53.113 --> 13:54.513
- Hey.
- Hey!

13:54.515 --> 13:57.249
Hey. Hey. Ha-hah!

13:57.251 --> 13:59.151
About before...

13:59.153 --> 14:01.019
I was just trying to cheer Glenn up,

14:01.021 --> 14:04.790
but I should not have said that
the reporter was only interested

14:04.792 --> 14:06.558
in your ideas because she
was attracted to you.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.059
So...

14:08.061 --> 14:09.227
I am sorry.

14:10.964 --> 14:11.963
Don't worry about it.

14:11.965 --> 14:14.099
But for the record,

14:14.101 --> 14:16.401
if someone had said that
to you, as a woman,

14:16.403 --> 14:18.303
you probably wouldn't
have been cool with it.

14:18.305 --> 14:19.471
Yeah, I know. That's wh...

14:19.473 --> 14:21.473
Don't worry about it. It's done!

14:21.475 --> 14:23.108
Teachable moment.

14:27.314 --> 14:29.548
Uh, you know, if the
roles were reversed...

14:29.550 --> 14:31.383
Oh, okay. Nope, sure.

14:31.385 --> 14:33.451
Attention, Cloud 9 employees:

14:33.453 --> 14:35.120
emergency meeting in the break room.

14:35.122 --> 14:36.454
Now!

14:36.456 --> 14:38.523
I'm sorry to interrupt
all of your days,

14:38.525 --> 14:40.091
but I think this would be a good time

14:40.093 --> 14:42.027
for me to go over Cloud 9's policy

14:42.029 --> 14:44.629
on inappropriate sexual
behavior in the workplace.

14:44.631 --> 14:45.597
Oh...

14:45.599 --> 14:47.232
You said this was an emergency!

14:47.234 --> 14:48.200
I know what I said.

14:48.202 --> 14:49.401
I was peeing!

14:49.403 --> 14:50.936
I had to cut myself off.

14:50.938 --> 14:52.671
It's very uncomfortable.

14:52.673 --> 14:55.307
Now, before I start this seminar,

14:55.309 --> 14:57.242
does anyone have something
they'd like to say?

14:59.012 --> 15:00.545
Okay, fine.

15:00.547 --> 15:03.515
Sal and I are having sex
in the dressing rooms.

15:06.553 --> 15:07.786
Ugh.

15:07.788 --> 15:09.020
I don't even like him.

15:09.022 --> 15:10.655
I have self-esteem issues,

15:10.657 --> 15:13.992
and I think being with him is
a way of me punishing myself.

15:13.994 --> 15:15.260
It's messed up.

15:15.262 --> 15:16.561
Shut up, Sandra.

15:16.563 --> 15:18.563
God, you are such a whiner. Sit down.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.600
Anyone else?

15:24.438 --> 15:26.037
Okay.

15:26.039 --> 15:29.841
Well, then without further
ado, please watch this video

15:29.843 --> 15:33.144
on inappropriate sexual
behavior in the workplace.

15:34.648 --> 15:36.481
Oh, my.

15:36.483 --> 15:38.149
Okay!

15:39.152 --> 15:40.585
- Jonah!
- Well, well, well.

15:40.587 --> 15:41.887
Oh, my goodness.

15:45.225 --> 15:47.525
My boy! That is my boy!

15:47.527 --> 15:49.060
Ugh! I just ate!

15:49.062 --> 15:52.097
Is that how people really kiss now?

15:52.099 --> 15:53.498
I think we've seen enough.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.600
Why would anybody be
attracted to Jonah?

15:55.602 --> 15:57.402
He looks like a villain on the CW.

15:57.404 --> 15:58.803
Uh, maybe it's because she thought

15:58.805 --> 16:01.740
all of his brilliant ideas
were inside his mouth,

16:01.742 --> 16:03.742
so she had to, like, get
in there with her tongue

16:03.744 --> 16:04.843
and suck 'em out.

16:04.845 --> 16:06.511
- Mm-aww, aww!
- Oh, my God.

16:06.513 --> 16:08.280
You will spread your legs for anyone

16:08.282 --> 16:09.948
who will write a story
about you, won't you?

16:09.950 --> 16:11.249
- That has nothing to do...
- Jonah.

16:11.251 --> 16:12.550
There's about 50 store rules

16:12.552 --> 16:14.052
broken on that tape.

16:14.054 --> 16:15.120
- I know.
- It is disgusting.

16:15.122 --> 16:16.187
I'm sorry.

16:16.189 --> 16:17.923
And there's just one thing left to say.

16:17.925 --> 16:18.924
You're...

16:18.926 --> 16:19.925
safe now.

16:19.927 --> 16:20.992
Bring it in.

16:24.164 --> 16:25.430
Wow.

16:25.432 --> 16:27.799
You fit right in there
perfectly, don't you?

16:28.936 --> 16:30.201
You've been sexually assaulted.

16:30.203 --> 16:31.169
- What?
- And...

16:31.171 --> 16:32.637
I was hoping you could start to heal

16:32.639 --> 16:34.439
by admitting that here
in a safe place, but...

16:34.441 --> 16:35.807
No, no, that's not... no.

16:35.809 --> 16:38.576
You are obviously very ashamed.

16:38.578 --> 16:40.045
No. No, no.

16:40.047 --> 16:41.513
Hey.

16:41.515 --> 16:43.214
You didn't
do anything wrong.

16:43.216 --> 16:44.282
I wasn't assaulted.

16:44.284 --> 16:45.517
It wasn't an assault. It was...

16:45.519 --> 16:46.618
- Both of us wanted...
- See?

16:46.620 --> 16:47.986
- That's what happens.
- No, it was...

16:47.988 --> 16:49.354
The person thinks it's their fault.

16:50.357 --> 16:51.589
It's called slut-shaming.

16:51.591 --> 16:52.590
No, he's a victim.

16:52.592 --> 16:54.059
You're the only slut in here, Sandra.

16:54.061 --> 16:56.061
Maybe we should all just
stop talking about this.

16:56.063 --> 16:57.062
No.

16:57.064 --> 16:58.863
Or we could play it again

16:58.865 --> 17:00.765
and then do the voices of
what they're thinking.

17:00.767 --> 17:02.100
- Mm-hmm.
- Great.

17:02.102 --> 17:04.002
Sorry ev... Nope.

17:04.003 --> 17:06.471
Let's all give Jonah a round
of applause, everybody.

17:06.473 --> 17:08.106
He's had a hard day.

17:09.108 --> 17:10.241
No. No, that's not...

17:10.242 --> 17:11.242
Bravo!

17:11.243 --> 17:13.243
Drink it in.

17:13.246 --> 17:14.913
Sorry about the rape, dude.

17:24.921 --> 17:26.921
I guess my philosophy of
life is "dare to dream..."

17:26.923 --> 17:27.922
No...

17:27.924 --> 17:29.624
But also dream to dare.

17:29.626 --> 17:31.626
But also daring to not...

17:31.628 --> 17:33.227
Okay, so the article that I'm writing

17:33.229 --> 17:36.130
is about the store in general
and not any one individual.

17:36.132 --> 17:38.499
Oh. Okay.

17:38.501 --> 17:42.103
Well, if you do decide to
write an article about me,

17:42.105 --> 17:45.106
I'll be in the stockroom, waiting.

17:45.108 --> 17:49.143
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.

17:52.949 --> 17:54.315
Ugh, God.

17:55.418 --> 17:56.584
Oh, God.

17:56.586 --> 17:58.486
You are a journalist and a rapist,

17:58.488 --> 18:00.788
and those are the two worst
things any person can be.

18:00.790 --> 18:02.924
Now, listen up, Connie Chung.

18:02.926 --> 18:05.059
If you set foot in this store...

18:05.061 --> 18:06.861
ever again...

18:06.863 --> 18:08.462
I will bring hell down on you.

18:13.336 --> 18:14.335
Let's go.

18:14.337 --> 18:15.436
Hey!

18:15.438 --> 18:18.072
Thank you so much for coming today.

18:18.074 --> 18:19.206
Oh, you're welcome.

18:19.208 --> 18:21.375
You know, you never actually
got a picture of me.

18:21.377 --> 18:23.978
- Oh, darn.
- Uh, but, I'm free now.

18:23.980 --> 18:25.913
Are people still saying "cheese"?

18:25.915 --> 18:27.315
- Uh...
- 'Cause, I don't want to...

18:27.317 --> 18:28.749
Yeah, you know, I wish I could,

18:28.751 --> 18:31.285
but this camera only
holds 5 million photos.

18:32.522 --> 18:34.255
- Oh.
- Thanks, though.

18:35.992 --> 18:38.559
Hold up.

18:38.561 --> 18:40.227
You haven't gotten a picture of me yet.

18:40.229 --> 18:41.429
Oh.

18:41.431 --> 18:42.964
Why don't we get one with my boy Glenn?

18:42.966 --> 18:45.433
Yeah. Terrific.

18:45.435 --> 18:46.867
- Yeah?
- All right.

18:46.869 --> 18:48.402
Yeah. All right.

18:49.339 --> 18:50.738
Hey, reporter!

18:50.740 --> 18:52.707
Will you listen to a song
for the jingle contest?

18:52.709 --> 18:53.874
I'd love to.

18:53.876 --> 18:56.143
That's why I went to journalism school.

18:56.145 --> 18:58.546
* Cloud 9, come inside *

18:58.548 --> 19:00.815
* Let the savings rain down on you *

19:00.817 --> 19:02.450
* Ooh *

19:02.452 --> 19:04.919
That's... actually
surprisingly not terrible.

19:04.921 --> 19:06.220
Really?

19:06.222 --> 19:07.655
Oh, my God, Bo. She loves it.

19:07.657 --> 19:08.923
I'm psyched.

19:08.925 --> 19:10.491
Yeah, it's good. It's a catchy tune.

19:11.494 --> 19:12.593
Catchy?

19:16.432 --> 19:17.965
Thanks.

19:17.967 --> 19:19.066
You know what?

19:19.068 --> 19:20.668
Forget about it.

19:20.670 --> 19:22.236
Bo is the man that I love,

19:22.238 --> 19:23.971
and I won't watch him
give up who he is,

19:23.973 --> 19:27.141
even if it means losing
millions of dollars.

19:27.143 --> 19:28.309
Millions of dollars?

19:28.311 --> 19:30.077
Yeah. You can keep your stupid money.

19:30.079 --> 19:31.178
Okay, just to be clear,

19:31.180 --> 19:33.147
the prize is a $10 Cloud 9 gift card.

19:33.149 --> 19:34.215
You heard her.

19:34.217 --> 19:35.516
Don't be trying to suck us back in

19:35.518 --> 19:37.051
with your fancy-ass lawyer words.

19:37.053 --> 19:39.353
Here's what I think about
that contract right here.

19:39.355 --> 19:41.155
Ohh!

19:41.157 --> 19:42.423
Rip, rip, double rip.

19:43.426 --> 19:44.425
That's not a contract.

19:44.427 --> 19:45.860
That was the directions to my hotel.

19:45.862 --> 19:47.461
Whatever, illuminati.

19:53.836 --> 19:56.203
Hey, Stud.

19:56.205 --> 19:57.972
Hey, listen.

19:57.974 --> 19:59.540
For the record...

19:59.542 --> 20:01.375
It is none of my business.

20:01.377 --> 20:04.145
It was just two consenting
adults making out...

20:04.147 --> 20:05.713
next to 80 bags of kitty litter.

20:05.715 --> 20:06.847
But I'm not judging you.

20:07.884 --> 20:09.350
So are you leaving, or...

20:09.352 --> 20:11.218
Just waiting for my ride.

20:11.220 --> 20:13.320
Hey. Let's go.

20:13.322 --> 20:16.023
My hotel's right around the corner.

20:16.025 --> 20:17.992
Wow.

20:17.994 --> 20:20.361
So you guys have, like,
more ideas to talk about.

20:20.363 --> 20:21.862
Uh, no, no.

20:21.864 --> 20:24.198
I'm
just really, really, cute.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.433
That's not what I said.

20:25.435 --> 20:27.201
Like a panda.

20:36.946 --> 20:40.414
The new issue of "Stratus" is here.

20:40.416 --> 20:41.449
Oh, God.

20:41.451 --> 20:44.285
I'm so excited.

20:44.287 --> 20:46.287
Hot off the press.

20:53.096 --> 20:54.095
I made the cover.

20:55.998 --> 20:57.198
I made the cover!
