WEBVTT

00:02.254 --> 00:05.377
Good morning, USA!

00:05.805 --> 00:08.892
I got a feeling that it's
gonna be a wonderful day.

00:09.428 --> 00:12.088
The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face.

00:12.315 --> 00:15.431
And he's shining a salute
to the American race.

00:18.848 --> 00:21.290
Oh, boy, it's swell to say.

00:22.099 --> 00:24.752
Good morning, USA!

00:27.362 --> 00:29.438
Good morning, USA!

00:32.281 --> 00:35.000
And so we say good-bye
to Walter Ellis

00:35.502 --> 00:38.021
Good old five-foot-11 Walter.

00:38.187 --> 00:40.000
Who could forget his, um...

00:40.694 --> 00:45.587
blue eyes and brown hair
and some kind of striped shirt

00:45.765 --> 00:47.465
with maybe something
written on it?

00:47.587 --> 00:48.546
This is ridiculous.

00:48.589 --> 00:50.091
Even Father Donovan
can't remember

00:50.238 --> 00:51.470
who this poor
schlub was.

00:51.746 --> 00:53.742
You will be respectful
in the house of the Lord!

00:54.048 --> 00:54.671
Look at Steve.

00:54.788 --> 00:57.750
He's a good Christian child:
mouth shut, nose in the Bible.

00:57.785 --> 00:59.572
- Oh, really?
- Of course.

00:59.758 --> 01:01.691
He's reading
the glorious passage where

01:01.736 --> 01:05.432
Dumbledore makes the candles
float in the cafeteria.

01:06.215 --> 01:07.921
Ah! Deuteronomy.

01:08.306 --> 01:12.010
And so, we'll certainly miss
our dear old friend Walter,

01:12.358 --> 01:15.820
who was also qualified
to ride a motorcycle.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.001
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:18.765 --> 01:20.272
Now let's raffle off his stuff!

01:21.038 --> 01:23.701
First up, some kind
of crappy little paddle boat.

01:23.716 --> 01:25.393
Oh, I totally want that.

01:25.975 --> 01:27.781
Dear Lord, please
make my ticket the winner.

01:28.315 --> 01:29.550
Oh, and now you'll win?

01:29.847 --> 01:32.431
Even if there was a God,
I doubt he'd run the universe

01:32.485 --> 01:34.510
like a vending machine,
where you put in a prayer

01:34.737 --> 01:35.542
and out pops...

01:35.576 --> 01:36.971
641!

01:37.007 --> 01:38.470
Yes! Thank you, Jesus!

01:39.096 --> 01:40.210
God is my copilot,

01:40.375 --> 01:42.710
and the Virgin Mary
is my hot stewardess.

01:42.995 --> 01:44.873
Ding! More nuts, Mary!

01:47.728 --> 01:48.521
Don't worry, Francine.

01:48.566 --> 01:50.940
I'm not a millionaire.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.253
I'm just taking
my paddleboat

01:52.566 --> 01:54.832
out on her maiden voyage,
and you're coming with me!

01:55.047 --> 01:57.642
Oh, I would, Stan,
but Linda and I

01:57.767 --> 01:59.773
are going to the mall
to watch Mexican babies

01:59.816 --> 02:01.211
get their ears pierced.

02:01.245 --> 02:02.942
Fine. How about
it, Steve?

02:02.988 --> 02:05.010
Sorry. Steve and I are going
to the carnival.

02:05.056 --> 02:07.092
I'm going to get drunk
and make out with the deaf girl

02:07.288 --> 02:08.740
who runs the Tilt-A-Whirl.

02:09.036 --> 02:10.902
She'll reject me, but,
for the rest of my life,

02:11.056 --> 02:13.990
carnivals will always
have a sad magic about them.

02:14.547 --> 02:18.061
Hmm. Sad magic.
If anybody ever writes a book

02:18.196 --> 02:20.090
about Doug H
that's pretty much your title.

02:20.396 --> 02:21.870
All right, Hayley,
I guess it's you and...

02:21.987 --> 02:22.221
No.

02:22.537 --> 02:23.453
Fine. Then I'll call a friend.

02:24.007 --> 02:25.730
ll just open up
my address book...

02:29.038 --> 02:31.780
Oh, my God!
Stan has no friends!

02:31.857 --> 02:33.053
And he didn't even realize!

02:33.335 --> 02:35.402
He's like "America: the Guy!"

02:35.468 --> 02:37.531
What are you talking about?
Of course I have friends.

02:37.778 --> 02:41.743
Stan, honey, you,
you, you, you, you,you, you... you don't.

02:41.776 --> 02:44.031
But I... I gotta have friends.

02:44.336 --> 02:46.242
Even child molesters have friends.

02:46.288 --> 02:48.672
I mean, they're usually
other child molesters,

02:48.715 --> 02:51.073
but, you know, they
go to lunch and stuff.

02:51.707 --> 02:54.851
Well, look at that.
The mosquito will be your friend.

02:54.858 --> 02:56.952
As long as you stand your private life

02:56.995 --> 02:57.983
in avoid cedar.?

02:58.018 --> 02:59.723
Francine, how can this be true?

02:59.756 --> 03:01.432
What the hell's wrong with me?

03:01.466 --> 03:02.610
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

03:02.658 --> 03:05.620
Well, for starters, you're an intolerant,
judgmental extremist.

03:05.656 --> 03:06.540
Wait a minute.

03:06.576 --> 03:09.111
Of course I have
a friend: my boss!

03:09.395 --> 03:11.093
And I'm going to go
see him right now.

03:13.136 --> 03:15.950
Sorry. I was only half paying
attention to all that.

03:15.986 --> 03:17.172
Is Dad a millionaire?

03:21.975 --> 03:22.921
Yes?

03:22.947 --> 03:24.273
It's Smith, sir.

03:24.306 --> 03:26.242
I thought, after working
together all these years,

03:26.285 --> 03:27.852
you might like to hang out.

03:28.306 --> 03:30.782
Senor Bullock no here.

03:30.818 --> 03:33.250
Go away or I keel you!

03:33.478 --> 03:36.251
Sir, I can actually see you
through the window.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:49.298 --> 03:52.382
You spent all your money
trying to win a hat with antlers?

03:52.425 --> 03:54.621
I do not choose to discuss it.

03:54.658 --> 03:56.282
I see a very lucky boy.

03:56.327 --> 03:57.730
Wow! Really?

03:57.777 --> 03:59.173
Will you tell my fortune?

03:59.375 --> 04:01.540
Steve, before she
tells you your future,

04:01.575 --> 04:02.931
let me tell you her past:

04:02.976 --> 04:06.510
40 years of alcoholism
and three doctor-less abortions.

04:06.558 --> 04:09.843
You are a sad,
angry little person.

04:10.145 --> 04:11.431
That's uncanny!

04:11.477 --> 04:13.100
What would you like to know?

04:13.308 --> 04:14.853
Um... I don't know.

04:14.897 --> 04:17.603
I guess just if there's
anything special about me, or...

04:17.648 --> 04:20.920
Yes! You are special!
I... I see it!

04:20.925 --> 04:21.923
Wow!

04:21.947 --> 04:24.452
Steve, she's
just repeating what ever you say.

04:24.486 --> 04:27.221
You're just jealous because
I'm special and you're not.

04:27.255 --> 04:29.143
You're boring and regular.

04:30.177 --> 04:34.872
Regular? Oh, Steven, I am
going to hurt you so bad.

04:35.738 --> 04:37.543
I got a question
about the future.

04:37.748 --> 04:40.111
Do you see yourself
taking a shower ever?

04:41.988 --> 04:43.633
Dear Lord, if you're not too busy

04:43.676 --> 04:46.122
giving the guys at McDonald's
new sandwich ideas,

04:46.168 --> 04:47.422
I wanted to ask you something.

04:47.726 --> 04:50.531
Am I a loser? 'Caure
I don't have any friends.

04:50.585 --> 04:52.851
I mean, I just want someone

04:52.896 --> 04:54.542
who wants to hang out
with me, you know?

04:54.655 --> 04:56.822
Someone I have something
in common with. Someone who...

04:56.858 --> 04:59.471
Is that your
Eager Beaver 350 out front?

04:59.778 --> 05:02.001
That paddle
boatis a sweet machine.

05:07.047 --> 05:09.570
- Brett Morris.
- Stan Smith.

05:09.598 --> 05:12.322
- So, you like paddle boats?
- Damn right.

05:12.356 --> 05:14.562
I think it's 'cause
they remind me of a simpler,

05:14.597 --> 05:16.771
better time when white
maleshad all the power

05:16.806 --> 05:18.263
instead of just most of it.

05:18.306 --> 05:20.561
I know. I hate how
whave most of the power.

05:20.595 --> 05:23.713
The problem is the liberals'
generous social programs.

05:23.745 --> 05:26.833
Exactly! They've turned
us into a nation of wimpy...

05:26.867 --> 05:27.761
Flag-burning...

05:27.807 --> 05:28.671
Foreigner-lovers!

06:02.696 --> 06:04.290
Oh, for God's sake!

06:09.567 --> 06:11.421
I was just taking
a midnight stroll

06:11.456 --> 06:14.192
when I saw what looked
like a magical owl fly by and...

06:14.227 --> 06:15.551
Oh! Look at that!

06:15.597 --> 06:17.930
It's right here, and it's
carrying a letter!

06:19.727 --> 06:20.631
What does it say?

06:20.668 --> 06:24.453
It says I've been admitted
to Hogwart's School Of Wizardry!

06:24.488 --> 06:26.901
The gypsy was right!
I am special!

06:27.736 --> 06:30.840
And here I was thinking
you were just a gullible idiot.

06:30.886 --> 06:32.851
- When will you start?
- This Saturday.

06:32.895 --> 06:34.312
I'd better start packing.

06:35.867 --> 06:38.191
Who deserves a Milk Dud?

06:38.226 --> 06:40.040
You do.

06:47.085 --> 06:49.901
I think I'm gonna take some time off
from the restaurant

06:49.945 --> 06:52.381
next monday and patrol
the Canadian border

06:52.428 --> 06:54.870
for old people trying to get
good inexpensive drugs.

06:54.916 --> 06:55.483
You in?

06:55.515 --> 06:58.360
Like a morally-justification
little injection!

06:58.404 --> 07:00.277
Stan, I am so glad I met you.

07:00.305 --> 07:04.795
Most people just think I'm intolerant
and judgmental, but you get me.

07:04.827 --> 07:06.066
And you get me.

07:06.519 --> 07:09.433
I guess that's why God,
in his infinite and glorious wisdom,

07:09.475 --> 07:10.361
brought us together.

07:11.066 --> 07:12.292
Or whatever.

07:12.605 --> 07:13.443
What do you mean?

07:13.475 --> 07:16.073
- Well, I don't believe in God.
- Huh?

07:18.257 --> 07:20.412
Stan? Stan, you okay?

07:21.356 --> 07:23.792
- Atheist!
- Stan, relax.

07:23.958 --> 07:25.322
Why is this
such a big deal?

07:25.366 --> 07:27.292
What? That you're
a Godless heathen?

07:27.336 --> 07:29.230
But we're agreed
about everythig else.

07:29.237 --> 07:32.042
We're both gun-loving,
red meat-eating Republicans

07:32.076 --> 07:35.591
with a passion for paddleboats
that sometimes borderson the erotic.

07:35.638 --> 07:38.320
And we're both Godless heathens.
That's just you!

07:38.405 --> 07:39.882
Look, I'm sorry, Stan,

07:39.915 --> 07:42.873
but I've just never seen any reason
to believe God exists.

07:42.915 --> 07:45.840
Okay, well, I can help you with that.
Give me one second.

07:47.706 --> 07:49.670
Hey, fellas, how ya coming with that machine

07:49.707 --> 07:51.630
that beams an image of the Christian God

07:51.677 --> 07:53.051
directly into people's brains?

07:53.417 --> 07:56.153
Yeah, we're gonna
have to call you back.

07:56.536 --> 07:58.373
Fine. I don't need science.

07:58.416 --> 08:00.441
That's exactly what
I'm trying to disprove.

08:00.937 --> 08:04.033
I am about to show you
irrefutable proof that God exists.

08:04.075 --> 08:07.133
Hey, whatever it takes
to put this whole thing behind us.

08:11.778 --> 08:13.360
Just look at that sunset.

08:13.397 --> 08:17.302
If that's nothing but science,
then why is it so damned romantic?

08:17.908 --> 08:19.773
Stan, please
let go of my hand.

08:20.257 --> 08:21.323
I will not.

08:26.766 --> 08:29.041
The 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team?

08:29.118 --> 08:32.482
I mean, sure, they were under dogs,
but that's not really a miracle.

08:32.518 --> 08:34.659
Not the team.
Kurt Russell.

08:34.706 --> 08:37.549
He's been working steadily
for 46 years.

08:37.596 --> 08:39.001
No lull. No lull!

08:41.607 --> 08:43.030
Now, that's a miracle.

08:43.065 --> 08:45.111
Well, birth is
an amazing process,

08:45.146 --> 08:47.860
but it's completely
explainable by natural laws.

08:47.996 --> 08:50.982
Okay, I'll give you that.
But look at the vagina!

08:51.027 --> 08:53.970
Look at it stretch.
It's so strong and resilient.

08:54.475 --> 08:56.883
That's what our troops
should be wearing!

08:59.178 --> 09:00.561
Well, here we are.

09:00.608 --> 09:03.251
This is Hogwarts-
the American campus.

09:03.295 --> 09:06.181
I know it doesn't
look like much, but-

09:06.227 --> 09:08.433
Oh, you muggles!
Cla spell at work here,

09:08.465 --> 09:10.602
hiding the true
appearance of the school.

09:10.645 --> 09:12.783
You wouldn't understand
how these things work.

09:14.528 --> 09:16.572
Why don't you go bang
on the door real hard?

09:16.616 --> 09:17.871
Let them know
you're here.

09:17.906 --> 09:20.771
Well, have fun with your
regular, boring life, Roger.

09:20.807 --> 09:22.543
I've got magic to learn.

09:23.286 --> 09:25.740
Okay, Steve, how special
are you gonna feel

09:25.777 --> 09:28.190
when some crack whore
throws you off her porch?

09:29.825 --> 09:32.132
- You the new kid?
- Yes, sir!

09:32.176 --> 09:34.610
The owl brought memy
official letter of admission.

09:34.656 --> 09:36.391
Shut up! Get your ass in here.

09:36.437 --> 09:38.300
Oh, you're so strict!

09:38.337 --> 09:40.230
You'll probably turn out
to be a good guy!

09:47.776 --> 09:49.750
Is he fighting
invisible dementors?

09:49.788 --> 09:50.752
Shut up!

09:51.768 --> 09:52.973
Potions class!

09:53.017 --> 09:55.652
Did you get all this stuff
from Professor Snape?

09:55.685 --> 09:58.292
You do not freakin' ask
who we got this from!

09:59.075 --> 10:01.002
He Who Shall Not Be Named!

10:01.306 --> 10:03.351
This is Hoppy.
He knows what to do.

10:03.397 --> 10:06.250
My potions partner!
You're my Ron Weasley!

10:06.286 --> 10:07.472
Lavate las manos.

10:07.508 --> 10:08.622
Is that a spell?

10:08.656 --> 10:12.813
- Lavate las manos!
- Lavate las manos.

10:12.847 --> 10:20.893
- Lavate las manos!
- Lavate las manos!

10:25.716 --> 10:27.892
Breathe it in.
Just smell it!

10:27.937 --> 10:30.360
This rotting whale
proves God exists.

10:30.518 --> 10:32.481
For, even in death,
it provides sustenance

10:32.517 --> 10:34.022
for the Lord's other creatures.

10:34.058 --> 10:35.793
And a pretend jail for me.

10:36.895 --> 10:38.012
Let me outta here!

10:38.777 --> 10:41.751
Squid-Face does horrible things
to me after lights out!

10:42.567 --> 10:44.033
Unspeakable things.

10:44.357 --> 10:45.312
Enough, Stan!

10:45.358 --> 10:46.960
Why is this is such a big deal?

10:47.005 --> 10:49.441
Because, if I can't
make you believe in God,

10:49.488 --> 10:50.600
then you won't
go to heaven,

10:50.646 --> 10:52.861
and I want our friendship
to last forever.

10:52.896 --> 10:54.611
Just picture it.

11:10.187 --> 11:11.231
Thank you, Stan.

11:11.275 --> 11:13.583
Thank you for proving
to me that God exists

11:13.617 --> 11:16.011
so I can have
this awesome after life.

11:16.096 --> 11:18.360
You're the best friend ever.

11:42.686 --> 11:47.061
But the only way it can happen
is if you embrace God.

11:47.097 --> 11:49.573
Look, Stan, I like that
you're close-minded.

11:49.615 --> 11:50.983
It's one of the things
we share,

11:51.015 --> 11:53.393
but if you can't
accept me for who I am,

11:53.436 --> 11:55.493
then this friendship is over!

11:56.097 --> 11:57.271
Brett, no!

11:57.306 --> 11:58.732
You gotta believe!

11:59.137 --> 12:02.760
Wait! The Lord is my shepherd,
but you're my ride home!

12:14.618 --> 12:18.360
I got your message
that you needed meright now, poolside.

12:18.406 --> 12:21.290
Oh, Father Donovan,
right this way.

12:25.375 --> 12:28.331
Your husband is home
and he's looking right at us.

12:28.378 --> 12:29.940
I- I know he's here.

12:29.976 --> 12:32.310
I called you over
so you could talk to him.

12:32.967 --> 12:37.231
Next time maybe don't end your text message
with a side ways smiley face.

12:37.266 --> 12:38.891
It's very misleading.

12:45.858 --> 12:46.500
What?

12:46.977 --> 12:48.911
I'm having a spiritual crisis.

12:48.946 --> 12:52.022
What do you do when your best
friend doesn't believe in God?

12:52.066 --> 12:54.561
Well, Stan, we're
hardly best friends.

12:54.606 --> 12:56.851
I tried everything
to convince Brett

12:56.895 --> 12:59.110
that God exists,
but nothing worked.

12:59.118 --> 13:01.973
Now he's going
to burn in hell for all eternity.

13:02.017 --> 13:06.323
Oy! I am so sick of listening
to everyone's problems.

13:06.365 --> 13:10.193
Why do people only come to me
when their live sare in shambles?

13:11.308 --> 13:15.471
Of course! People turn to God
in times of crisis.

13:15.517 --> 13:17.901
If I want to save
Brett's immortal soul,

13:17.938 --> 13:20.191
all I have to do
is destroy his life!

13:21.095 --> 13:21.932
Thanks, Father.

13:25.107 --> 13:28.073
So am I gonna see some jugs
or am I wasting my time here?

13:32.165 --> 13:35.092
There a freaking pineapple
embargo or what?

13:35.878 --> 13:39.220
Oh, hey, you're alive
and probably pretty pissed.

13:39.288 --> 13:41.302
What the hell is that?

13:41.346 --> 13:43.563
It's $2,000 my professor gave me

13:43.605 --> 13:45.303
for doing a good job
in potions class.

13:45.346 --> 13:48.632
Two, two grand?
$2,000? $2,000?

13:48.666 --> 13:51.912
Yeah, you can have it
if you want.

13:51.955 --> 13:55.131
It's muggle money.
So, now why would I be pissed?

13:56.098 --> 14:00.262
You would be pissed if I forgot
to give you this magic wand.

14:00.706 --> 14:02.802
Wow! It's so light!

14:02.846 --> 14:06.773
I- I can't tell if I'm leading it
or it's leading me.

14:06.977 --> 14:08.931
Oh, is that another one?

14:08.938 --> 14:10.272
No, that's a chop stick.

14:10.955 --> 14:13.330
Look, I've been acting like a jackass.

14:13.567 --> 14:16.083
It was ridiculous of me
to think we had to agree

14:16.117 --> 14:17.523
about every little thing.

14:17.558 --> 14:20.473
That's okay, Stan.
I can't stay mad at you.

14:20.517 --> 14:21.953
That's such a relief.

14:21.988 --> 14:24.123
And as a token of my
unconditional friendship,

14:24.155 --> 14:25.611
I wanna give you this.

14:26.816 --> 14:29.792
I hope you know I'd do anything
to save this friendship...

14:30.198 --> 14:31.511
anything.

14:31.548 --> 14:33.612
Go ahead takea closer look.

14:34.455 --> 14:36.071
Closer...

14:41.358 --> 14:44.110
Wow, what an unexpected
piece of adversity.

14:44.148 --> 14:46.233
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

14:46.266 --> 14:48.781
I'm just glad my wife
and kids weren't home.

14:49.615 --> 14:52.890
Oh, yeah. Wow, that,
that was lucky.

14:52.926 --> 14:55.842
I can't believe this.
It's completely destroyed.

14:55.886 --> 14:57.932
You know, it's
times like this,

14:57.968 --> 14:59.941
I'm glad I've got God to turn to.

14:59.975 --> 15:03.712
Yeah, it's times like this, I'm glad
I've got home owner's insurance.

15:05.417 --> 15:07.161
Damn! I'm failing him.

15:07.205 --> 15:08.872
Some friend you are, Stan.

15:08.918 --> 15:10.513
Show me the way, Lord.

15:10.558 --> 15:12.693
Show me the way
to really make him suffer.

15:15.467 --> 15:16.603
Order up!

15:20.077 --> 15:21.151
Order up!

15:22.035 --> 15:24.101
Great! Well, thanks for nothing!

15:24.148 --> 15:26.401
My insurance won't
cover explosions.

15:26.436 --> 15:28.820
Well, at least you still
have this restaurant.

15:28.866 --> 15:30.331
Sir, we have a problem.

15:37.078 --> 15:39.922
So far, 53 cases of bird flu
have been traced

15:39.956 --> 15:41.260
to Brett's Breakfast Joint.

15:41.267 --> 15:43.651
Although, I got to say I ate
there this morning and I...

15:45.675 --> 15:46.713
This is a nightmare!

15:46.918 --> 15:48.871
I put my life into
that restaurant.

15:50.295 --> 15:52.203
So, what are you gonna do?

15:52.237 --> 15:54.343
I mean, where will you turn
in this hour of need?

15:54.348 --> 15:55.363
It' gone be ok.

15:55.396 --> 15:58.803
The important thing is
I've still got my family.

15:58.835 --> 16:01.740
Yeah, I kinda thought
you might say that.

16:01.775 --> 16:03.440
Brett, I've realized
I'm a lesbian

16:03.475 --> 16:04.951
so I'm leaving you
and taking the children.

16:04.985 --> 16:07.182
What? When did you
become a lesbian?!

16:07.228 --> 16:08.602
That is so ignorant!

16:08.636 --> 16:10.542
You don't become
a lesbian.

16:10.586 --> 16:12.980
It's not like someone shot an
experimental beam into my head

16:13.028 --> 16:14.702
and suddenly I'm gay!

16:15.506 --> 16:19.360
Wait! Don't do this!
You're all I have!

16:22.128 --> 16:23.741
Put on your pants, Jesus.

16:23.785 --> 16:25.361
There's someone at the door.

16:27.697 --> 16:29.312
Brett?
Brett?!

16:33.257 --> 16:36.992
Oh, my God! Brett, no!
Wait there! I'm coming!

16:40.658 --> 16:42.322
Hello, Sharper Image?

16:42.355 --> 16:44.833
Yeah, give me three
Sopranos pinball machines,

16:44.878 --> 16:46.112
the radio golf ball,

16:46.147 --> 16:47.323
a floating ant farm,

16:47.358 --> 16:50.130
a flashlight hammer
to smash the ants with

16:50.178 --> 16:51.111
if they piss me off.

16:52.725 --> 16:55.663
I'm, uh, I'm gonna
call right back.

16:55.696 --> 16:57.161
What the hell is that?!

16:57.205 --> 16:59.400
Oh, I wanted to practice
potionsat home

16:59.437 --> 17:01.483
so I borrowed some supplies.

17:01.527 --> 17:03.493
Oh, my God,
what did you do?!

17:03.535 --> 17:05.420
Professor Ice pick
won't mind.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.310
It's like I'm doing
extra credit.

17:07.358 --> 17:08.862
Do they know
where you live?

17:08.907 --> 17:10.381
Do they know where
you live?!

17:15.637 --> 17:18.531
Hey, look who's here! Professor!

17:19.157 --> 17:20.940
We can't let them know
we're home!

17:20.977 --> 17:22.303
- Why not?
- Because...

17:23.444 --> 17:25.153
they're Death Eaters.

17:25.258 --> 17:29.062
Oh, disguised as teachers
from the school.

17:33.238 --> 17:35.780
Okay! I pun.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.000
Ocules reparo.

17:38.047 --> 17:40.123
You, you put him
up to this?

17:40.797 --> 17:42.560
I'll save you, Roger.

17:42.597 --> 17:44.333
Lavate las manos.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.721
You like that?!

18:01.565 --> 18:02.723
Get his ass!

18:08.315 --> 18:10.402
I'm amazingly focused right now!

18:10.888 --> 18:12.550
Lavate las manos.

18:13.005 --> 18:14.771
Lavate las manos.

18:19.517 --> 18:21.573
Lavate las manos.

18:23.508 --> 18:24.652
You want some, too?!

18:24.685 --> 18:26.402
I got plenty for everybody.

18:36.367 --> 18:37.663
Uh! TV is safe.

18:38.326 --> 18:40.712
Lavate las manos!

18:43.138 --> 18:46.263
- Wow, I did it.
- What?!

18:46.498 --> 18:48.910
My spells defeated
the Death Eaters.

18:48.956 --> 18:50.672
I am awesome!

18:56.405 --> 18:57.901
That's right.

18:57.948 --> 18:59.343
Which is why I'm gonna show you

18:59.386 --> 19:02.272
how to make a really cool potion
in this bathtub.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.730
Yeah! What do we need?

19:03.778 --> 19:05.973
Some sulfuric acid
and a hacksaw.

19:09.585 --> 19:11.612
Come on, Brett, you can
pull out of this.

19:11.918 --> 19:15.170
Dear Lord, I know
this is all my fault.

19:15.215 --> 19:16.680
I wasn't tolerant.

19:16.725 --> 19:19.292
I tried to change my friend
and look what happened.

19:19.327 --> 19:21.922
I swear to you,
if you bring Brett back,

19:21.965 --> 19:24.533
I will accept him exactly
the way he is.

19:28.058 --> 19:30.232
Brett? Brett, I thought
I lost you!

19:30.277 --> 19:31.091
Stan?

19:31.127 --> 19:33.392
Look, Brett,
I have to tell you the truth.

19:33.438 --> 19:36.301
I was behind all those bad
things that happened to you.

19:36.346 --> 19:37.402
I'm so sorry.

19:37.446 --> 19:39.762
I was just trying
to get you to turn to God.

19:39.906 --> 19:42.573
Stan, it's okay
'cause I believe now.

19:42.575 --> 19:45.051
- I believe in God!
- Really?

19:45.086 --> 19:47.000
Yes, I actually met him

19:47.046 --> 19:49.960
right before he kicked me down
to hell for committing suicide.

19:51.655 --> 19:53.740
And that's where
I met the devil,

19:53.786 --> 19:55.601
who agreed to let me
come back to life

19:55.635 --> 19:58.671
if I would work to spread
the fame and glory of Satan!

19:59.877 --> 20:01.070
Now, now, Brett,

20:01.106 --> 20:03.521
you know you've suffered
some massive head trauma.

20:03.555 --> 20:05.363
No, Stan, it's true.

20:05.408 --> 20:08.610
Where else would I have gotten
this awesome goat guitar...

20:08.987 --> 20:11.123
and be able
to play it like this?

20:18.407 --> 20:20.391
You made a bargain
with the devil?

20:20.436 --> 20:21.362
Hang on.

20:23.975 --> 20:25.862
But that's your eternal soul.

20:48.197 --> 20:50.193
Man, I'm starved!

20:50.236 --> 20:53.172
Want to go get some nacho
sand watch the Ravens' game?

20:53.208 --> 20:54.642
Brett, you're a Satanist!

20:54.688 --> 20:56.710
I could only be friends with you
if you believed in...

20:57.315 --> 20:58.643
Believed in what?

21:00.216 --> 21:03.142
Whatever you want, pal,
whatever you want.

21:03.178 --> 21:04.400
Thanks, Stan.

21:04.855 --> 21:06.451
Hey, you still play
golf, right?

21:06.498 --> 21:09.650
Stan, I'm a Satanist,
not a poor person.
