CHRIS ROCK:
As graduation got closer,

00:06.807 --> 00:08.809
I thought about
my days at Corleone.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.044
It had been tough,

00:10.078 --> 00:13.214
but the one good thing
was that Greg was always there.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.517
We got beaten up together.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.252
Hey, Zephyr.

00:20.088 --> 00:22.656
And, of course, we hung out
after school together.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.326
Do you think it's safe
to go out yet?

00:25.359 --> 00:28.262
No, we'd better give it
another hour.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.531
And now we'd be going
to high school together.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.300
Dude, I've got some bad news.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.068
I'm not going
to high school with you.

00:34.102 --> 00:35.336
What?!

00:35.369 --> 00:36.437
My mother submitted me
for a scholarship

00:36.470 --> 00:38.772
to the Bronx Academy of Science
without telling me.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.508
Better than the time
she submitted him

00:40.541 --> 00:42.443
for adoption
without telling him.

00:42.476 --> 00:43.377
You're kidding.

00:43.411 --> 00:44.578
Did you get accepted?

00:44.612 --> 00:46.614
Dude, I am so in there.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.149
Sorry.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.383
Well, congratulations.

00:49.417 --> 00:50.418
Thanks, man.

00:50.451 --> 00:51.785
That was sarcasm, dummy.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.421
So your mother submitted
you for a scholarship

00:53.454 --> 00:55.289
without telling you?

00:55.323 --> 00:56.324
Yeah, her and Ms. Morello.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.459
She was afraid that
if I didn't get accepted,

00:58.492 --> 00:59.393
I'd be disappointed.

00:59.427 --> 01:01.462
When I was seven,
I lost a spelling bee

01:01.495 --> 01:02.696
and went into
a black depression.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.299
That happened to me
when I saw Soul Plane.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.301
To this day, I can't say
"pulchritudinous"

01:07.335 --> 01:08.769
without crying.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.504
So where are you going
to high school?

01:10.538 --> 01:12.640
Well, I want to go
to Foxy Brown High.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.742
The principal looks
like Pam Grier.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.777
But my mom wants me
to go to Tattaglia.

01:16.810 --> 01:19.447
I just don't think I can go
through four more years

01:19.480 --> 01:20.581
of being
the only Black kid.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.217
I wasn't sure what
Tattaglia would be like,

01:23.251 --> 01:25.586
but judging from the name,
I had an idea.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.357
Don't worry, man.

01:29.390 --> 01:32.293
If you can make it through this,
you can make it through that.

01:32.326 --> 01:35.463
He must have me confused
with Nelson Mandela.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.506
* Ah, make it funky now.

CHRIS ROCK:
Even though I knew

02:09.763 --> 02:11.732
I'd probably meet more people
after I graduated,

02:11.765 --> 02:13.534
the fact was,
Greg was my closest friend,

02:13.567 --> 02:15.736
and replacing him
wasn't going to be easy.

02:15.769 --> 02:19.273
Dude, you are so in there.

02:19.307 --> 02:20.608
Next.

02:23.277 --> 02:26.180
Dude, we are so in there.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.648
Next.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.217
Oy.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.385
Dude, you are so in there,

02:31.419 --> 02:33.387
though I would prefer
not ending a sentence

02:33.421 --> 02:35.189
with a prepositional phrase.

02:35.223 --> 02:37.225
I would prefer never seeing
your face again.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.359
Next.

02:38.392 --> 02:39.793
Next...

02:39.827 --> 02:42.563
Next!

02:42.596 --> 02:44.865
Dude... you are...

02:44.898 --> 02:46.200
Next!

02:46.234 --> 02:48.502
That's cold, man.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.338
I'm supposed to be your boy.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.672
What happened to you?

02:51.705 --> 02:53.741
I'm practicing
eating by myself again.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.543
Good practice
for my "dating years."

02:55.576 --> 02:57.811
You act like we're never going
to see each other again.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.547
This isn't easy for me, either.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.382
Well, at least your whole
school's not gonna hate you.

03:01.415 --> 03:02.883
People have to notice you
to hate you.

03:02.916 --> 03:03.917
I'm gonna be invisible.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.719
I'd pay money to be invisible.

03:05.753 --> 03:06.854
I mean, look at me.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.357
I got one friend,
and he's white.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.658
Look at me.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.526
I got one friend,
and he's Black.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.627
You got a point.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.463
You know, we can't
let this happen.

03:15.496 --> 03:16.664
Starsky and Hutch
didn't break up.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.465
They were both white.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.732
Butch and Sundance
didn't break up.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.568
White again.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.303
Crocket and Tubbs
didn't break up.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.637
Tubbs thought he was white.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.673
What am I supposed to do,
come to school with you?

03:25.706 --> 03:27.575
Yeah.
How am I supposed
to do that?

03:27.608 --> 03:29.643
I don't know, I guess we're
just gonna have to find out.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.579
If that's what
you want to do.

03:33.681 --> 03:34.815
Let's do it.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.652
Are you crazy?

03:38.686 --> 03:40.654
Do you see the tuition
at this school?

03:40.688 --> 03:41.622
That was all he saw.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.657
This is a good school.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.759
JULIUS:
This is an
expensive school.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.661
He's going to end up
a homeless genius.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.630
I think Chris can benefit
from being around

03:49.663 --> 03:51.932
kids like this that
go to a school like this.

03:51.965 --> 03:54.302
She means white kids.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.703
Greg is going, too.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.572
Baby, you know he had
a hard time at Corleone.

03:58.606 --> 04:01.041
It was your idea
to send me there.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.944
And at least he doesn't have
to make all new friends.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.714
No, I'll have a massive
"one friend" head start.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.682
Chris, you can make new friends
at a public school.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.050
You've got the whole
public to choose from.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.885
ROCHELLE:
Look at all these great

04:13.354 --> 04:13.987
She means white teachers.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.624
If we send Chris
to that school,

04:16.657 --> 04:18.459
what'll happen when Drew
and Tonya graduate?

04:18.492 --> 04:20.060
Oh, baby...

04:20.093 --> 04:22.596
Can't we just worry
about that then?

04:22.630 --> 04:24.298
Can we just
think about it?

04:24.332 --> 04:25.466
I thought about it.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.767
And I'm smart enough to know

04:26.800 --> 04:28.936
we are too poor for
Chris to be that smart.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.539
Now I'm rich enough
to be stupid.

04:31.572 --> 04:32.706
Sorry, man.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.041
But, Julius...

04:36.677 --> 04:38.446
While my plans
went into the garbage,

04:38.479 --> 04:40.581
Uncle Ryan threw out
a proposal.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.416
Hey, just the man
I'm looking for.

04:42.450 --> 04:45.052
Translation:
"I need some money."

04:45.085 --> 04:47.821
Hey, man,
what you got going this time?

04:47.855 --> 04:49.790
Uncle Ryan
is selling mixtapes.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.625
Mixtapes?

04:51.659 --> 04:54.928
What, like masking tape
and duct tape on the same roll.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.096
That's a good idea.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.965
Nah, man, mixed tapes.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.833
Mixtapes.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.736
A mixtape is a compilation
of tracks

05:02.770 --> 05:04.572
that have been recorded
on a cassette tape.

05:04.605 --> 05:07.708
These tapes, once compiled, can
be sold on any major city street

05:07.741 --> 05:09.610
out of the trunk
of a Black man's cars,

05:09.643 --> 05:12.613
typically a Buick or a Lincoln.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.814
Since the cost of the tapes
is so low,

05:13.847 --> 05:16.617
and the music is free, selling
mixtapes was and is still,

05:16.650 --> 05:19.753
a profitable,
although illegal, business.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.121
Hey, Dad,

05:21.154 --> 05:22.656
Uncle Ryan said
I could work for him, too.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.592
And you know you
said you can't wait

05:24.625 --> 05:25.726
for Drew to get his first job.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.628
That's not a real job.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.663
A real job takes place
in a building.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.732
They shouldn't be able
to tow your office.

05:31.765 --> 05:32.766
Unless you sell ice cream.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.635
I'm only selling out the
back of my car for now.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.637
I'm going to move to
something more permanent.

05:36.670 --> 05:37.805
Like a van.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.072
What happened to your
auto parts store?

05:39.106 --> 05:41.442
The owner broke it up for parts.

05:41.475 --> 05:42.743
Man, I love this song.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.945
Everybody's going
to be buying this one.

05:44.978 --> 05:46.814
I made you a profit before.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.749
Trust me,
I'm going to do it again.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.018
How much you need?

05:51.051 --> 05:52.686
A hundred.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.021
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, Uncle Ryan.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.623
Hey, what's going on?

05:55.656 --> 05:57.658
I'm selling tickets
to my ballet recital.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.393
I'm doing something
from Swan Lake.

05:59.427 --> 06:00.894
Uh-oh. A ballerina.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.596
How much are they?

06:02.630 --> 06:03.497
Five dollars.

06:03.531 --> 06:04.865
Hey, man, loan me ten bucks.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.099
I just gave you a hundred.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.802
That's my seed money.

06:08.836 --> 06:09.937
It's for your daughter.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.542
Before ATM machines, my father
was the human version.

06:14.575 --> 06:15.976
You just had to know the code.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.549
This is so exciting
that you're all graduating.
Thanks, Ms. Morello.

06:21.582 --> 06:24.852
I'm very proud of everyone.

06:24.885 --> 06:28.789
Gregory, you've got such
a bright future ahead of you.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.724
And, Chris,
in your family,

06:30.758 --> 06:33.827
this must be like
getting a PhD.

06:33.861 --> 06:36.129
Have you thought about
what high school

06:36.163 --> 06:37.498
you're going to yet?

06:37.531 --> 06:40.000
Oh, well, I want to go
to the Bronx Academy
of Science with Greg.

06:40.033 --> 06:43.771
Now, Chris, you've graduated
from junior high,

06:43.804 --> 06:46.173
but let's not get uppity.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.642
I felt too low to get uppity.

06:48.676 --> 06:51.812
The Bronx Academy
is for the exemplary students.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.848
Maybe you should think about
something more realistic.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.884
She means a school
with metal detectors.

06:56.917 --> 06:57.985
You helped me get in.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.520
Can't you help him?

06:59.553 --> 07:02.890
Chris, let's not forget
you flunked math last year.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.725
Yeah, but I passed
everything this year.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.894
Oh, that's right.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.930
Maybe I can have you apply
under the minority curve.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.532
What's that?
J.Lo's butt.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.133
It's an affirmative action plan.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.603
The plan being
"If we let one in,

07:15.636 --> 07:16.737
maybe they'll leave us alone."

07:16.770 --> 07:18.506
Well, what do
I have to do?

07:18.539 --> 07:19.840
Well, first you
have to be Black.

07:19.873 --> 07:20.841
Check.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.644
And then you have to take
the admittance exam.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.746
And if you pass, they'll
pay for you to go.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.581
It's a full scholarship.

07:27.615 --> 07:28.849
I'll do whatever it takes.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.884
All right then,
I'll help you out.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.553
This is great.
Thanks.

07:32.586 --> 07:35.556
Now give me some skin.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.893
I've always wanted to do that.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.863
Run before she makes you
tap dance.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.932
While I was getting
a vote of confidence,

07:44.965 --> 07:46.600
my mother was demanding
a recount.

07:46.634 --> 07:49.036
What do you mean you gave
Ryan a hundred dollars?

07:49.069 --> 07:50.638
What are you getting
all upset about?

07:50.671 --> 07:52.573
He'll pay it back,
and then some.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.908
That is not
what I'm talking about.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.677
Your son asked you to send him

07:56.710 --> 07:58.712
to one of the best schools
in the city,

07:58.746 --> 08:00.914
and all you could do was say,
"Oh, I can't afford it."

08:00.948 --> 08:02.816
But then your brother
comes waltzing in here

08:02.850 --> 08:03.917
talking about
he's selling mixtape

08:03.951 --> 08:05.185
out of the trunk of his car,

08:05.218 --> 08:07.821
and all of a sudden
you become Daddy Warbucks?

08:07.855 --> 08:08.989
Daddy Warbucks?

08:09.022 --> 08:10.057
Daddy Warbucks?

08:10.090 --> 08:12.125
He's the rich guy
from Little Orphan Annie.

08:12.159 --> 08:12.893
Oh.
Oh.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.562
So?

08:14.595 --> 08:15.262
What?

08:15.295 --> 08:16.830
Explain yourself.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.031
Rochelle, look,

08:18.065 --> 08:19.567
I want Chris
to go to the school,

08:19.600 --> 08:21.101
but that's me spending money
I don't have.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.803
Mixtapes are an investment.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.037
Unlike education.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.139
Besides, I want to help
my brother out.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.576
You never help my brother out.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.910
Are you kidding me?

08:29.943 --> 08:31.178
Since we've been married,

08:31.211 --> 08:34.081
he's eaten $12,038.12 worth
of groceries.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.750
I'm helping him stay alive.

08:36.784 --> 08:39.052
Amazingly, my mother didn't
have a comeback for that one.

08:41.589 --> 08:42.723
I stand corrected.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.925
Meanwhile, I trained
for the Bronx Academy

08:44.958 --> 08:47.795
like the Karate Kid trained
for that evil blond kid.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.229
"How are you?"

08:49.262 --> 08:50.230
Fine. And you?

08:50.263 --> 08:51.732
"Very good."

08:51.765 --> 08:52.600
Glad to hear it.

08:52.633 --> 08:53.901
"See you tomorrow."

08:53.934 --> 08:55.002
You betcha.

08:55.035 --> 08:55.936
What?

08:55.969 --> 08:58.639
Oh, sorry,
I was working with Ping earlier.

08:58.672 --> 09:01.041
The belief that the United
States was destined to expand

09:01.074 --> 09:02.843
from the Atlantic Seaboard
to the Pacific Ocean

09:02.876 --> 09:04.244
was called
"Manifest Destiny"?

09:04.277 --> 09:06.013
Should've been called,
"Hey, Indians,

09:06.046 --> 09:07.948
ready or not, here we come."

09:21.294 --> 09:22.663
Chris.

09:22.696 --> 09:23.997
Yes?

09:24.031 --> 09:24.965
You passed.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.700
Oh, man, this is great.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.301
You made it
to the Bronx Academy.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.003
Well, hold on a minute.

09:30.037 --> 09:30.804
Hold on a minute?

09:30.838 --> 09:32.105
What do you mean
hold on a minute?

09:32.139 --> 09:33.240
I passed, didn't I?

09:33.273 --> 09:36.276
Yes, but that only qualifies you
for the home interview.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.011
And assuming your mother
is sober for that,

09:38.045 --> 09:39.847
and it goes off okay,

09:39.880 --> 09:42.282
then you'll be eligible
for the financial review.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.017
What next, a drug test?

09:44.051 --> 09:46.086
Then, of course,
there's the drug test.

09:46.119 --> 09:49.657
I hope Marion Jones doesn't
want to go to this school.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.062
While I was trying
to get into school,

09:55.095 --> 09:57.030
Tonya was trying
to stay on point.

09:57.064 --> 09:59.633
Hey, baby, how are your
ticket sales going?

09:59.667 --> 10:02.069
Eh... I sold them all.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.837
What's wrong?

10:03.871 --> 10:05.072
Well, I just found out

10:05.105 --> 10:06.807
that I'm not going to be
in the recital anymore.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.677
Oh, no, what happened?

10:09.710 --> 10:12.045
The teacher said
you're one of her best dancers.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.915
You know my partner,
Derrick, right?
Yeah.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.417
Well, he had a ballet accident,
and he broke his ankle.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.819
Well, what happened?

10:18.852 --> 10:20.253
Well, he told some guys
that he did ballet,

10:20.287 --> 10:21.421
and they broke his ankle.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.326
Oh, baby, I know you had
your heart set on this.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.729
You mean you had
your heart set on it.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.197
It's okay.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.264
No, no, it's not.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.066
You know what, baby,
don't worry.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.835
We're going to find you
another boy to dance with.

10:34.868 --> 10:35.969
Ma, in Bed

10:36.003 --> 10:37.270
That's what I was going to say.

10:37.304 --> 10:40.173
Come on, let's make
some phone calls.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.209
Come on.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.945
While my mother searched
Brooklyn for a Baryshnikov,

10:44.978 --> 10:47.380
my Uncle Ryan found
his inner Russell Simmons.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.717
Two, two fifty,

10:49.750 --> 10:52.152
three, three fifty,

10:52.185 --> 10:53.420
400 dollars.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.689
Ooh... I cannot
believe this.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.190
$400 selling tapes.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.026
Man, I gotta tell you,

10:59.059 --> 11:00.127
I didn't think
it was going to work.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.094
Have I ever lied to you?

11:01.128 --> 11:03.063
No, I guess you haven't.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.265
But lying and not knowing what
the hell you're talking about

11:05.298 --> 11:07.100
are two different things.

11:07.134 --> 11:09.269
Drew, take this money
and put it away.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.739
Don't worry, I will.

11:11.772 --> 11:12.906
Here, take this tapes
as a bonus, too.

11:12.940 --> 11:13.974
It's the Hilly Hill mix.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.408
Those guys are new,
they're not really selling.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.110
"MC Hammer"?

11:17.144 --> 11:18.211
"Public Enemy"?

11:18.245 --> 11:20.480
"DJ Jazzy Jeff &
the Fresh Prince"?

11:20.513 --> 11:22.015
I've never heard of these guys.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.250
You will.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.852
You'd be better off erasing
the tape and selling it blank.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.387
Well, can I have
the new Fat Boys album?

11:27.420 --> 11:29.389
Go into Wal-Mart
and ask that question now.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.024
Fine.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.325
Cool.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.493
"Beastie Boys"?

11:33.526 --> 11:34.862
They're white.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.029
White rappers?

11:36.063 --> 11:37.197
:
I don't think so.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.832
Look, I gotta go.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.167
I got to get some rest
before I go to work.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.135
Hey, I'm sorry, man,
I didn't mean to cause

11:42.169 --> 11:43.203
any problems
with Rochelle.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.238
That's okay-- problem solved.

11:45.272 --> 11:46.807
There aren't many
marriage problems

11:46.840 --> 11:48.809
Benjamin Franklin can't fix.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.377
This is pretty much a formality.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.079
I have a few questions.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.080
Oh, no problem.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.782
We have nothing to hide.

11:54.815 --> 11:58.085
How long have you been addicted
to heroin?

11:58.118 --> 11:59.152
I'm sorry?

11:59.186 --> 12:00.353
Well, I understand

12:00.387 --> 12:01.755
you've struggled with drugs

12:01.789 --> 12:03.390
and alcohol
most of your adult life.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.993
He must have her confused
with Lindsay Lohan.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.828
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.930
You must have me mistaken
for somebody else.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.198
That's ridiculous.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.767
I can see it's a sore subject.
Let me move on.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.969
You have three
children, right?

12:16.003 --> 12:17.270
Yes.

12:17.304 --> 12:18.772
Can I have
their fathers' names?

12:18.806 --> 12:20.240
Ju...

12:20.273 --> 12:22.409
No, no, no.
They have one father.

12:22.442 --> 12:23.977
Mm.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.112
Do you know his name?

12:25.145 --> 12:27.280
Where are you getting
this information?

12:27.314 --> 12:29.316
I'll tell you
where he's getting it.

12:29.349 --> 12:32.185
Unfortunately,
I think Chris is a crack baby.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.855
The mother's
a little delusional.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.223
Her brain is addled by years

12:36.256 --> 12:39.126
of drug abuse and cheap wine
spo-dee-o-dee.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.294
She's actually convinced herself

12:41.328 --> 12:44.197
that she has a husband
who works two jobs

12:44.231 --> 12:47.200
and that they own a house
in the ghetto.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.402
You can't believe a word
she says.

12:51.571 --> 12:54.441
Julius--
he's my husband

12:54.474 --> 12:57.010
and is the father
of my three children.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.980
He has two jobs,
and we own this house.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.148
Are you writing this down?

13:01.181 --> 13:05.252
Young man, let me ask you
a question.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.856
Why do you want
to go to the Bronx
Academy of Science?

13:08.889 --> 13:10.557
Because that's
where my friend's going.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.325
'Cause I love science?

13:12.359 --> 13:14.561
Why do you love science?

13:14.594 --> 13:16.864
Because it's in the name
of your school.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.531
'Cause I like
to cut frogs open?

13:20.033 --> 13:21.935
Klingons?

13:23.470 --> 13:25.205
Mr. Perkins...

13:25.238 --> 13:26.573
If you don't let me in,

13:26.606 --> 13:29.009
she'll smack the scholastic
out of you.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.011
Chris has the desire
to learn.

13:31.044 --> 13:35.315
He has a strong family
who loves and supports him

13:35.348 --> 13:38.285
in a warm
and stable environment.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.220
MAN:
Freeze!

13:40.253 --> 13:42.155
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
It was just tapes!

13:42.189 --> 13:43.323
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
It was just tapes.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.859
ROCHELLE:
What is the...?

13:45.893 --> 13:47.194
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.
They have a hostage!

13:47.227 --> 13:49.196
Let me see your hands!
Drop the pamphlet...

13:49.229 --> 13:49.997
Hostage? I'm not dropping no...

13:50.030 --> 13:51.164
...and step away
from the white guy.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.466
ROCHELLE:
Get your hands off of me!
I didn't do nothing.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.136
All right, everybody, down
on the floor, down on the floor.

13:56.169 --> 13:59.139
You need to settle down
and drop the pamphlet.
Get your hands off of me...!

13:59.172 --> 14:01.541
ROCHELLE:
I said, get your hands
off of me now!

14:01.574 --> 14:03.276
I apologize,
but it's protocol.

14:03.310 --> 14:06.246
How often does this kind
of thing happen here?

14:06.279 --> 14:08.281
Surprisingly,
not that often.

14:12.019 --> 14:14.187
When you're Black,
first the cops charge,

14:14.221 --> 14:15.522
then they explain the charge.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.057
What's the charges?
Copyright
infringement.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.358
Infringement? What
are you taking about?

14:18.391 --> 14:20.093
I was just making tapes
of people's songs.

14:20.127 --> 14:21.428
Just get in the car.

14:21.461 --> 14:24.431
Once again, I
apologize on behalf of

14:24.464 --> 14:26.967
the New York Police
Department for any
inconvenience.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.368
Oh, that's okay.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.103
I wasn't talking to you.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.308
Mr. Perkins, I'm sorry
about all this.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.144
Son, you had
terrific test scores

14:37.177 --> 14:38.211
and glowing
recommendations,

14:38.245 --> 14:40.981
but with this unbelievably
horrible environment,

14:41.014 --> 14:43.150
you need us more than
I thought you did.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.384
Congratulations.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.386
That's right.
Just get your butt out of here.

14:46.419 --> 14:47.454
Mom! Mom! Mom!
Mom! Mom! Mom!

14:47.487 --> 14:49.556
We don't need you
or your stupid racist school.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.258
Mom, no. No.
Mom, I'm in.
You know what? This...

14:51.291 --> 14:54.427
What are you talking
about you're in?

14:54.461 --> 14:56.129
Just fill out
these application forms

14:56.163 --> 14:58.165
and attach a copy
of your financial records.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.233
Once that clears,
Chris will be the newest student

15:00.267 --> 15:01.434
at the Bronx Academy

15:01.468 --> 15:02.936
of Science.

15:02.970 --> 15:05.372
My baby made
it into school!

15:05.405 --> 15:07.240
(applause, cheering
and whistling)

15:07.274 --> 15:09.009
Now if you'll
excuse me,

15:09.042 --> 15:10.277
I'm going to go get drunk.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.479
You know what would
be a good idea?

15:12.512 --> 15:15.148
A show about cops
arresting people.

15:15.182 --> 15:17.450
But what would you call it?

15:17.484 --> 15:19.252
My future was set,

15:19.286 --> 15:21.588
but Tonya's ballet career
was over before it started.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.424
Hey, Tonya, can I talk
to you for a minute?

15:24.457 --> 15:25.625
No.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.361
Look, I know you're all sad

15:28.395 --> 15:31.331
about Derrick and his ankle,
but I think I can help you.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.166
Can you fix his ankle?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.334
Actually, he could.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.602
Actually, I could.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.972
But a compound fracture
has to set

15:39.006 --> 15:40.507
somewhere between five
and seven weeks,

15:40.540 --> 15:42.475
and he still wouldn't be ready
in time for the dance.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.677
So how can you help me?

15:44.711 --> 15:47.214
I could fill in
for him.
For real?

15:47.247 --> 15:48.348
Yeah. I mean,
I'm a pretty good dancer.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.682
If you show me what to do.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.684
You're not afraid someone
will call you a sissy?

15:51.718 --> 15:53.120
No. I don't care.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.522
Besides, I bet
they won't say it to my face.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.025
Like making fun
of Mike Tyson's voice.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.292
Thanks, Drew.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.328
Okay. Come on.
Come over here.

16:01.361 --> 16:04.564
Okay, so, you do your
feet like this, do
your arm like this.

16:04.597 --> 16:05.598
Graduating from Corleone

16:05.632 --> 16:08.301
was one of the best days
of my life,

16:08.335 --> 16:09.636
because I was surrounded
by my family,

16:09.669 --> 16:13.006
and this was the one day
I wasn't going to get punched,

16:13.040 --> 16:14.307
kicked, beat down
or talked about.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.209
Straighten out your
cap and gown, boy.

16:16.243 --> 16:18.478
And do not get on that
stage and embarrass me

16:18.511 --> 16:20.180
in front of these
white people,

16:20.213 --> 16:22.415
or else I'll slap the pomp
out of your circumstances.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.750
Scratch that.
Hi, Daddy.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.552
Hey, baby.
CHRIS:
Where were you?

16:25.585 --> 16:27.354
Bailing Uncle Ryan
out of jail.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.089
Well, where did you get
the bail money?

16:29.122 --> 16:31.091
My mixtape money.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.525
Would have gotten it back

16:32.559 --> 16:34.494
if Uncle Ryan
hadn't skipped bail.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.329
Hey, sorry, man,
but check it out.

16:36.363 --> 16:39.399
I was talking to this
guy down at the station.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.068
Did you know George
Foreman cooks?

16:41.101 --> 16:42.235
The boxer?
Yeah.

16:42.269 --> 16:43.503
He's coming out
with this grill.

16:43.536 --> 16:46.239
I hear it's going to
make a lot of money.

16:46.273 --> 16:47.407
A George Foreman grill?

16:47.440 --> 16:48.408
No, that's all right, man.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.710
I'm gonna wait on
the Muhammad Ali toaster oven.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.479
Come on, honey.
Let's go in.

16:52.512 --> 16:53.446
You look
nice, sweetie.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.614
Congratulations, man.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.449
* Looks like we made it...

16:56.483 --> 16:57.617
Hey, man.
Hey.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.286
We made it.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.554
I guess so. Let's get in there
so we can get out of here.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.490
Next stop,
the Bronx Academy.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.092
Dude, I am so in there.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.527
Hey, Spridel,
Chim Chim, let's go.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.397
* Looks like we made it...

17:10.430 --> 17:12.465
My days at Corleone had sailed,

17:12.499 --> 17:16.236
and Drew and Tonya
were floating on air.

17:44.464 --> 17:47.134
Those are
my babies.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.735
Aren't they
fabulous?!

17:48.768 --> 17:52.739
Drew got more women in a tutu
then I got at 22.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.111
So long, Greg.

17:58.145 --> 17:59.512
So long, Chris.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.214
What

18:01.248 --> 18:04.417
You got to go through the rest
of your life being Black.

18:04.451 --> 18:05.852
I can't top that.

18:05.885 --> 18:08.855
We won't ever have to
deal with him again.

18:08.888 --> 18:11.424
At the Bronx Academy of
Science, everyone's a nerd.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.826
Thank god we're not going
to Tattaglia.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.871
Chris, wait.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.409
What's wrong?

18:29.442 --> 18:31.211
Chris, I've got bad news.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.078
What?

18:32.111 --> 18:34.747
Well, I just heard
from Mr. Perkins.

18:34.781 --> 18:38.518
Unfortunately, your application
to the Bronx Academy was denied.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.853
What?!
I thought this was settled.
What happened?

18:40.887 --> 18:42.622
Well, as crazy as it may seem,

18:42.655 --> 18:45.325
it turns out your father
really does have two jobs.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.659
You're mother's not
a heroin addict.

18:46.693 --> 18:47.894
She's even got a job.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.696
And apparently,
you do own that house.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.564
Your family's doing
far too well

18:51.598 --> 18:54.167
for you to qualify
for financial aid.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.469
Chris, why did you lie?

18:56.503 --> 18:59.639
So what does
this mean?

18:59.672 --> 19:01.474
I'm sorry, but it looks like

19:01.508 --> 19:03.243
you're going to Tattaglia
after all.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.511
But this isn't fair.

19:04.544 --> 19:07.580
I know, but always
remember this.

19:07.614 --> 19:10.217
When you get to the other side
of the river,

19:10.250 --> 19:12.619
the streets of heaven
will be lined with gold

19:12.652 --> 19:15.355
for you, me
and all God's chillins.

19:15.388 --> 19:16.889
I was still in shock,

19:16.923 --> 19:19.192
so I didn't have the presence
of mind

19:19.226 --> 19:22.229
to smack her upside the head
and run.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.833
Oh, man.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.269
I know.

19:29.302 --> 19:32.272
* Hey, if we can't solve
any problems *

19:32.305 --> 19:33.740
So, what now?

19:33.773 --> 19:34.974
This is it.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.410
* Why do lose so many tears?

19:37.444 --> 19:38.511
Oh, man.

19:38.545 --> 19:42.482
I know.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.883
* Oh, so you go again

19:43.916 --> 19:45.785
But, you know,

19:45.818 --> 19:47.620
we're gonna hang out
during the summer.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.656
* When the leading man appears

19:49.689 --> 19:50.723
Yeah.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.592
Yeah.
Yeah.

19:52.625 --> 19:53.826
Yeah, totally.

19:53.860 --> 19:58.565
* Always the same theme

19:58.598 --> 20:00.667
* But can't you see

20:00.700 --> 20:05.305
* We've got everything
going on and on and on *

20:05.338 --> 20:07.240
Hey, Greg?
* Every time you go away

20:07.274 --> 20:08.408
Yeah?

20:08.441 --> 20:10.310
Catch you later.

20:10.343 --> 20:14.714
* You take a piece of me...

20:15.915 --> 20:17.284
Sorry.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.885
I couldn't let it go.

20:18.918 --> 20:22.355
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:22.389 --> 20:26.393
