01:03.730 --> 01:04.605
Breakfast time.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.074
Coffee and milk?

01:15.325 --> 01:16.159
Yeah.

01:21.623 --> 01:22.457
Thank you.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.335
Some bread, too.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.422
Do you mind if I ask your name?

01:30.215 --> 01:32.551
"Guard" will do.

01:33.885 --> 01:35.345
Guard.

01:37.139 --> 01:39.683
Does the guard know if
we'll see sunlight today?

01:40.851 --> 01:42.394
I haven't been told.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.898
Lunch is the usual, right?

01:46.982 --> 01:50.152
Rice, beans, macaroni and water.

01:50.736 --> 01:52.571
Who knows? We might surprise you.

01:56.283 --> 01:57.451
Have a good day, guard.

01:57.993 --> 01:58.994
Good day.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.708
The CEO of Petrobrasil,
João Pedro Rangel,

02:04.791 --> 02:06.918
was questioned by Federal Police.

02:07.002 --> 02:11.882
The 52-year-old engineer had a
bench warrant against him...

02:11.965 --> 02:13.508
I brought you some tea.

02:13.592 --> 02:17.846
at police HQ in Rio de Janeiro,
as part of Operation Jet Wash.

02:18.555 --> 02:22.142
Mr. Rangel has held his position
as Petrobrasil's supply director

02:22.225 --> 02:23.935
since 2013.

02:24.019 --> 02:25.437
That's enough.

02:27.356 --> 02:30.275
We need to go away for a while.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.195
Let the dust settle.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.492
I'll speak to Shayenne.
Let's take a trip.

02:38.575 --> 02:39.868
Far away.

02:52.714 --> 02:55.467
FEDERAL COURT

02:58.720 --> 03:01.723
Search and seizure at the
son-in-law?s and daughter's home?

03:02.182 --> 03:03.266
Yes.

03:05.894 --> 03:06.937
No.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.731
Judge Rigo, look at the images.

03:10.482 --> 03:13.693
The images speak for themselves.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.987
I'm not requesting a search and seizure.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.699
I'm ordering Mr. Rangel's arrest.

03:22.244 --> 03:25.664
Deputy, Dimas? Anything else?

03:26.248 --> 03:28.917
Sir, you do understand the scope of this?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.919
An order for preventive detention.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.631
That's the scope of this.

03:36.842 --> 03:37.676
OK?

03:38.260 --> 03:39.636
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.306
Here.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.351
"When visiting Japan, you
should set aside some time

03:46.435 --> 03:49.229
to see the beautiful
cherry blossom trees."

03:51.022 --> 03:51.898
What?

03:52.149 --> 03:53.275
I didn't say anything.

03:55.026 --> 03:58.071
Pepê, Japan! It's far away
and I've never been there.

03:58.155 --> 04:02.117
Not Japan. It has the largest
communications network in the world.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.162
- So what?
- Let's visit South Africa, then.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.038
- The savanna.
- South Africa? No.

04:07.122 --> 04:10.083
What's going on? It looks
like we're running.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.169
Are we running?

04:13.712 --> 04:17.466
- Are we in trouble, Dad?
- No trouble at all. Relax.

04:18.048 --> 04:18.884
Mom?

04:18.966 --> 04:21.595
Let's do South Africa.
Should I check for today?

04:21.678 --> 04:22.512
Yeah.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.598
What's the hurry? We cleared the office.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.476
Ricky even made me take old phone bills.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.102
Pay in cash, though.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.440
- Wait a second.
- I think you should pay in cash.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.525
What's going on?

04:51.416 --> 04:53.460
Aren't you going to talk to Roberval?

04:53.543 --> 04:54.377
No.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.588
To request a budget?

04:56.671 --> 04:59.591
No. I'll put it on my credit
card and get it reimbursed.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.551
I'm not losing JPR because of a budget.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.220
Take me with you.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.222
Should I cover your plane ticket, too?

05:05.597 --> 05:07.974
No way. I'm requesting a Rio unit.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.894
A Rio unit means Rio agents. Are
you going to risk it again?

05:10.977 --> 05:14.356
- Where are you from? - Raised in
Rio. Trained by Verena Cardoni.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.566
The best Federal Police unit.

05:17.943 --> 05:20.612
- I'll take the bus, then.
- No, you won't go by bus.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.240
By the time you arrive
I'll be back here. No.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.826
I can't stand being locked
up in here doing math.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.329
Seriously, I think I might
have overlooked something.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.872
Want to go to the beach?

05:30.956 --> 05:32.749
Beach, my ass!

05:34.042 --> 05:35.168
You have to let me go.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.878
I need to get into that house.

05:37.462 --> 05:38.421
Let me go back.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.555
Guilhome, the boy is coming with me.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.307
You stay here, at the base.

05:49.391 --> 05:52.227
Here, but not "here."
Work from your hotel.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.313
Grab your stuff.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.358
Let's go.

06:32.684 --> 06:35.270
Fuck! Pick up, Ricky.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.841
Let's get him.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.731
Pick up, Ricky. Pick up, damn it.

07:20.815 --> 07:23.485
Didn't we agree on taking
only carry-on bags?

07:23.568 --> 07:26.446
Honey, they're too small.
Nothing fits in them.

07:26.529 --> 07:29.282
And we always end up buying something.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.744
- Mrs. Samira, your pants.
- Thank you.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.079
Anything else?

07:35.455 --> 07:37.749
- It's Shayenne. Get it, Cibele.
- Yes, ma'am.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.044
You pick up when I call, Ricky!

07:41.127 --> 07:43.964
Come to my parents' place. Right now!

07:52.681 --> 07:55.350
Excuse me. Federal Police.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.560
Who gave you permission
to enter my house?

07:57.644 --> 07:59.813
It's private property.

07:59.896 --> 08:00.897
Are you going away?

08:01.481 --> 08:02.315
To the ranch.

08:02.941 --> 08:05.443
Any problem? We always spend
weekends at the ranch.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.571
Where is the ranch?

08:08.655 --> 08:12.367
Here's the deal. We're going on
a trip, a planned family trip.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.828
We're going to South Africa.
What's the problem?

08:14.911 --> 08:16.204
No, you're not going.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.664
What do you mean? Why not?

08:18.206 --> 08:20.542
I have a warrant for your
preventive detention.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.669
Issued by the District of Curitiba.

08:22.752 --> 08:23.586
Detention?

08:24.129 --> 08:26.297
You are detaining João Pedro Rangel?

08:26.381 --> 08:28.216
Director of Petrobrasil?

08:28.299 --> 08:30.093
- Do you know...
- Watch your tone.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.636
You may keep quiet as well.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.431
- On what grounds?
- Concealing evidence.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.347
Vander?

08:36.057 --> 08:37.142
OK. I'm going down.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.937
It seems there's more stuff downstairs.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.148
You can follow me.

09:43.958 --> 09:44.959
Count it, Vander.

09:55.637 --> 09:56.471
Guilhome?

09:57.180 --> 10:00.016
Yeah. Ask Curitiba for backup.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.976
- And a convoy escort.
- Sure.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.145
Escorts. I'm on it.

10:05.522 --> 10:08.233
Are you going to need an
armored truck as well?

10:11.402 --> 10:12.278
Right.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.628
Everyone thought I had died.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.466
But it wasn't my time yet.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.181
The bullet hit the tip
of the sphenoid bone,

10:40.265 --> 10:42.559
swerved down at an oblique angle,

10:42.976 --> 10:45.228
and exited through the
base of my right jaw.

10:49.482 --> 10:53.653
According to the doctor, the
odds of that are one in 3,000.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.406
A fucking miracle.

10:57.907 --> 11:01.035
If he makes it, no one knows
how bad the damage will be.

11:01.119 --> 11:05.623
His hearing, speech, cognition, motion...

11:06.291 --> 11:07.667
He was alone.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.713
I didn't join his fight.

11:13.548 --> 11:14.841
I left him on his own.

11:19.554 --> 11:22.390
They branded him nuts and got rid of him.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.824
The first person I thought of
when I came out of the coma,

11:42.952 --> 11:45.330
unfortunately, was not my daughter.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.709
But it was that motherfucker Ibrahim.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.918
Let's throw all this shit away.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.886
Sure. I'll help you.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.786
Tell her to count the money.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.039
Tell her to count the money.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.211
Tell her to count the money
in the target's presence.

13:15.294 --> 13:19.132
Verena, don't forget to count the
money in the target's presence.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.016
What did she say?

13:29.183 --> 13:31.394
"Go fuck yourself, Guilhome."
- I knew it.

13:31.894 --> 13:32.812
I knew it!

13:35.064 --> 13:35.898
I knew it.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.402
Guilhome isn't exactly
an accounting genius.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.572
Never was and never will be.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.867
I dropped Guilhome in Verena's team

13:45.950 --> 13:48.119
and was working from behind the scenes.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.419
- What's this money?
- It's mine. Why?

13:57.128 --> 13:57.962
Where is it from?

13:58.546 --> 14:04.135
I worked for Petrobrasil for 17 years.
João Pedro, 35.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.055
And why do you keep all
this money at home?

14:07.138 --> 14:10.058
- Is it a sin to keep money at home?
- Not at all.

14:10.141 --> 14:12.602
Undeclared income is not a sin.
It's a crime.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.605
Have you actually seen my tax return?

14:15.688 --> 14:18.566
Not yet. But I will.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.986
I can keep my money wherever I please.

14:22.070 --> 14:26.199
With an amount like that, I think
it should go to a bank, don't you?

14:26.282 --> 14:28.117
- Absolutely.
- It's safer.

14:28.743 --> 14:30.703
Every family has a reserve fund.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.955
- Reserve fund?
- That's right.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.124
You call this a reserve fund?

14:35.208 --> 14:38.127
You have the guts to call this
a reserve fund in front of us?

14:39.045 --> 14:40.463
What if we have an emergency?

14:41.047 --> 14:44.384
Boss, there's over three million here.

14:47.470 --> 14:52.183
Ma'am, are you telling me that over
three million reals is a normal amount?

14:52.266 --> 14:54.560
Sure. Completely normal.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.604
- Completely normal?
- Completely...

14:56.687 --> 14:59.982
Shut the fuck up! Don't
you dare yell at me.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.609
Respect the police force.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.277
Are you crazy?

15:04.904 --> 15:07.031
Grab all this shit and
let's get out of here.

15:38.229 --> 15:39.230
Turn around, sir.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.149
Hands out front.

15:45.862 --> 15:48.739
- Is this necessary?
- Yes. It's for your own safety.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.326
Would you like to say goodbye
to your wife? This is the time.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.421
Excuse me, ma'am.

16:10.678 --> 16:11.679
Watch your head.

16:38.664 --> 16:39.499
Mom!

16:40.750 --> 16:41.959
Mom!

16:43.920 --> 16:46.547
Mom, for God's sake, what
was behind that wall?

16:47.965 --> 16:50.343
- Why was Dad arrested?
- Call Ricky, Shayenne.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.720
Why was Dad arrested? Tell me, please.

16:52.803 --> 16:53.679
Talk to me.

16:53.763 --> 16:55.556
- Call your husband.
- I already did.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.934
He's on his way. Now tell me, please.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.269
- Why was Dad arrested?
- Calm down.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.271
I am calm. Now answer me.

17:02.355 --> 17:05.233
Why?

17:05.316 --> 17:08.277
Tell me, damn it! Why was Dad arrested?

17:08.361 --> 17:09.654
Calm down.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.034
What happened?

17:15.742 --> 17:16.618
What happened?

17:17.328 --> 17:18.329
Samira.

17:20.623 --> 17:23.876
- How did they know about the money?
- Somebody squealed.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.420
You knew?

17:30.967 --> 17:32.343
And you, too?

17:36.806 --> 17:38.683
Why did they arrest my dad, Ricky?

17:39.100 --> 17:40.977
What did they accuse him of?

17:41.060 --> 17:42.728
Concealing evidence.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.565
I think they know you
went into the office.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.024
- What?
- Who knows?

17:47.817 --> 17:48.651
The police know?

17:50.069 --> 17:51.821
You sent me to the office, Mom.

17:52.530 --> 17:56.075
You sent us there. You put
me in that office, Mom!

17:59.161 --> 18:01.038
You took me there, Ricky.

18:01.539 --> 18:02.915
You took me with you.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.129
I'm not a part of this.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.799
- I'll get my son and leave.
- Calm down.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.969
I am calm. But let me get
Paulinho out of here.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.637
- For God's sake!
- Fuck, Samira!

18:17.179 --> 18:18.139
Let me go.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.932
How long am I staying here?

18:20.391 --> 18:22.977
I am alleging a chronic heart disease.

18:23.060 --> 18:25.438
I'm not sure how long it takes.
Two to three weeks.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.565
That won't do. Figure it out, Motta.

18:28.858 --> 18:30.359
I'll make things better for you.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.111
The food is settled.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.739
- I'll get you a cell phone.
- I want to switch cells.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.993
I don't think the "friendly
agent" can arrange that.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.786
If I speak, I'll bring them down.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.830
They know that.

18:42.913 --> 18:46.250
Motta, pressure Brasília. I shouldn't
have to bite the bullet alone.

18:46.334 --> 18:48.210
They're already under pressure.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.920
Yes, and I'm in jail!

18:50.004 --> 18:52.256
Senators, congressmen... all calling me.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.134
- We're fine for now.
- "For now"?

18:55.217 --> 18:58.179
Your value could plummet.

18:59.388 --> 19:03.225
Our problem now is how
much you're worth to them.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.478
How much I'm worth? Is there any doubt?

19:06.103 --> 19:07.480
There's the JPR factor.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.982
What? JPR? They're bluffing.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.275
They're closing in.

19:11.359 --> 19:15.446
If they arrest him and he
squeals, your value plummets.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.240
It won't get that far.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.826
Hey, Vlade. Did you get my message?

19:21.619 --> 19:24.914
Yeah. There's a big fish arriving
now at the Federal Police.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.417
Petrobrasil's CEO under arrest? You
think they'll let that happen?

19:31.212 --> 19:32.630
Go over there. Trust me.

19:32.713 --> 19:35.341
If he talks, you're worth nothing.

20:04.453 --> 20:07.957
There are a lot of people in Brasília
afraid of what you might say.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.627
They say you're a bomb that
could blow up this country.

20:23.139 --> 20:26.809
It's a routine investigation. A
new phase of Operation Jet Wash.

20:26.892 --> 20:30.312
Our station specializes
in financial crimes.

20:30.396 --> 20:34.358
We're committed to finding the
answers this investigation demands.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.694
What's the situation for Petrobrasil?

20:36.777 --> 20:39.655
I don't have any further information yet.

20:39.739 --> 20:43.200
Let's wait a couple of days
and we can come back to that.

20:43.284 --> 20:45.119
This dumbass has got to be kidding.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.080
Why, Daddy?

20:49.373 --> 20:50.374
Nothing, sweetie.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.419
Nothing, my baby.

21:20.905 --> 21:21.739
Mr. Rangel?

21:23.324 --> 21:24.158
This way.

21:30.206 --> 21:31.624
Am I staying here?

21:32.208 --> 21:33.042
Yes.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.669
There are so many empty cells.

21:35.753 --> 21:37.379
Well, they put you in this one.

22:47.825 --> 22:50.202
I'm beginning to think you
want to take my place.

22:50.286 --> 22:52.997
- No, I like mine.
- It doesn't look like it.

22:53.789 --> 22:56.667
JPR plus 3.5 million behind a fake wall?

22:56.750 --> 22:58.919
It's too much to sweep under the rug.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.928
Up until then, we had only
caught currency dealers.

23:08.012 --> 23:10.598
But JPR was a whole other ballgame.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.976
Besides being Petrobrasil's CEO,

23:14.476 --> 23:17.229
he had been nominated by
government-based parties.

23:17.980 --> 23:21.150
If he said a word, a lot of
heavyweights would go down.

23:22.526 --> 23:25.154
It was as if a tsunami had hit Brasília.

23:26.196 --> 23:30.326
The government nominated ex-Justice
Minister Mário Garcez Brito,

23:30.409 --> 23:32.369
to lead the cover-up operation.

23:32.453 --> 23:35.289
No wonder the old guy was
known as "the Wizard."

23:35.372 --> 23:38.208
The João Pedro thing. It got out of hand.

23:38.292 --> 23:41.420
We'll find a way, Mr. President.

23:41.503 --> 23:44.882
We have to help João Pedro.
Take him out of Curitiba.

23:45.674 --> 23:48.010
This judge is very cocky.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.803
Such a conceited man.

23:50.679 --> 23:53.223
Let's cook his goose while we can.

23:53.307 --> 23:57.561
The man was able to convert bad guys
into saints in the blink of an eye.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.356
As long as the criminal paid the bill.

24:00.773 --> 24:03.317
And money? The government
had plenty of it.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.821
Meanwhile, Senator Lucio Lemes,

24:07.905 --> 24:11.325
opposition leader, sharpened his knives.

24:11.950 --> 24:15.954
He was ready to chop off the head
of anyone ratted out by JPR.

24:16.038 --> 24:19.750
Great potential for some serious
damage to her candidacy.

24:22.252 --> 24:23.087
OK.

24:23.170 --> 24:27.549
I need to go. I have a meeting now.

24:30.094 --> 24:34.139
Even the former Vice-President,
ex-congressman Samuel Thames,

24:34.723 --> 24:36.392
decided to come out of the shadows.

24:36.642 --> 24:41.397
Because if Janete's administration
went down, he could become president.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.441
If they don't, we'll have
to ban it in Congress.

24:44.525 --> 24:48.195
- It won't get that far.
- If it does, we'll be ready.

24:48.278 --> 24:49.613
It might be an opportunity.

24:57.371 --> 25:00.374
How are we supposed to do this?
We can't do it without a team.

25:00.457 --> 25:02.668
It's ridiculous. Roberval
is no help at all.

25:03.252 --> 25:05.129
I'm asking the Prosecutor for assistance.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.463
OK.

25:06.547 --> 25:08.132
With this much work...

25:17.516 --> 25:20.310
We started out with
three currency dealers.

25:20.394 --> 25:22.688
Actually, Chebab and
Kitano work for Ibrahim.

25:22.771 --> 25:26.066
They work like a bank clearing system.

25:26.150 --> 25:29.778
It was the deposits to Ibrahim's
companies that caught our attention.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.780
And his links to a Petrobrasil CEO.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.158
Who fell apart when they came knocking.

25:34.241 --> 25:37.411
Anyway, JPR's preventive
detention expires in 30 days.

25:38.287 --> 25:39.788
Send me what you've got so far.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.499
I'll think of a way to
bulk up the charges.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.043
Blitzkrieg!

25:45.127 --> 25:46.712
Disrupt the enemy.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.464
We're disrupted, Cláudio.

25:48.547 --> 25:51.133
Also, the five of us
make up the task force.

25:51.216 --> 25:54.887
If we want even the tiniest
chance, we all have to dig deep.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.348
Including you, Cláudio.

26:02.186 --> 26:03.687
Looks like it's going to go far.

26:05.272 --> 26:08.442
- It could get interesting.
- If they don't fumble it first.

26:08.525 --> 26:10.736
It will all work out and
we'll get out of here.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.863
It will only work out from here, Vanessa.

26:12.946 --> 26:14.364
I want to go back to Brasília.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.992
I can't get used to this place.

26:19.369 --> 26:23.582
Our house was better, my job was better.

26:23.665 --> 26:24.958
The school was better.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.254
Curitiba is in the middle of nowhere.

26:29.338 --> 26:32.090
Which might be just
what we need right now.

26:53.654 --> 26:54.696
Verena.

26:56.114 --> 26:56.990
Hey.

26:57.074 --> 26:58.742
Are you stalking me, Cláudio?

27:01.245 --> 27:02.079
Hi.

27:02.746 --> 27:03.580
Hi.

27:05.541 --> 27:06.375
Are you OK?

27:08.877 --> 27:10.170
What about you, Cláudio?

27:10.963 --> 27:12.673
Spent all those years in São Paulo?

27:13.465 --> 27:15.050
And some time in Macapá.

27:15.592 --> 27:17.010
Then São Paulo.

27:17.094 --> 27:18.971
- Was it good there?
- In Macapá?

27:19.054 --> 27:21.181
- São Paulo.
- Yes.

27:21.265 --> 27:22.975
São Paulo is OK.

27:24.476 --> 27:25.352
No big deal.

27:27.688 --> 27:29.982
So... what about Ruffo?

27:32.734 --> 27:33.735
Have you seen him?

27:35.237 --> 27:36.071
Not so much.

27:37.406 --> 27:38.407
How is he doing?

27:39.324 --> 27:40.701
He's out, Cláudio.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.079
You blame me for
everything that went down?

27:44.162 --> 27:46.415
No. Ruffo can get in trouble on his own.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.166
- But you blame me.
- No, I don't.

27:48.750 --> 27:52.504
I was happy that you got what you wanted.

27:53.505 --> 27:56.216
Leading an important operation.
A big one.

27:57.676 --> 27:58.677
I have to go.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.348
I'm glad to be back.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.330
It didn't mean anything?

28:26.413 --> 28:27.331
Should we insist?

28:27.414 --> 28:28.582
Going away is cowardly.

28:28.665 --> 28:29.833
What do you want?

28:29.917 --> 28:32.169
That I stay here and pay
for Ruffo's fuck-up?

28:32.252 --> 28:33.837
I'm out.

28:37.007 --> 28:38.717
Did you sort the documents?

28:38.800 --> 28:42.095
Seventy... 500... 224...

28:42.179 --> 28:43.680
- Thank you.
- Eight-thirty?

28:43.764 --> 28:45.057
Eight-thirty, 650...

28:45.682 --> 28:46.642
Guilhome.

28:47.809 --> 28:50.938
Here are some of Kitano's and
Chebab's bank statements.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.481
And Ibrahim's.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.733
- All in here?
- Yes.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.693
- Try to find a way to...
- Verena.

28:56.777 --> 28:57.611
What?

28:59.238 --> 29:02.115
Deposits for Luís Rebouças.

29:03.825 --> 29:06.328
And these are for Antonio Borelli.

29:06.411 --> 29:08.580
- Congressmen?
- Yes.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.291
It's not good news.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.168
It never is, Cláudio.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.086
It never is.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.255
Thanks.

29:25.681 --> 29:27.683
FEDERAL COURT

29:30.352 --> 29:32.437
There are two congressmen involved.

29:38.819 --> 29:40.612
We don't have jurisdiction.

29:40.696 --> 29:43.615
Can't we treat it as fortuitous evidence?

29:44.283 --> 29:46.827
If it goes to Brasília you
know what will happen.

29:47.703 --> 29:49.454
Thank you, Deputy.

29:49.538 --> 29:53.417
A Brasília judge will sit on
it for the next ten years.

29:53.500 --> 29:54.543
OK, Verena.

29:54.626 --> 29:55.752
You may go.

30:01.717 --> 30:04.136
The deadline is the end of the week, OK?

30:04.219 --> 30:05.887
Liana, I'm off.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.889
Thank you for squeezing me in.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.516
You don't need me for that.

30:09.599 --> 30:11.810
Everyone in here needs
you for everything.

30:12.269 --> 30:13.854
That's what they say about you.

30:14.354 --> 30:17.691
So, do you think he'll send all
of it to the Supreme Court?

30:17.774 --> 30:20.193
We'll only know once
he makes up his mind.

30:22.237 --> 30:23.905
And he only does what works for him.

30:24.614 --> 30:25.490
I know.

30:26.616 --> 30:28.201
OK. Thank you.

30:35.876 --> 30:36.710
I'm...

30:37.419 --> 30:38.420
I quit smoking.

30:39.921 --> 30:44.509
I tried a patch which made me more jumpy
than a kangaroo, but now I think...

30:44.593 --> 30:46.178
Now it's for real. I quit.

30:48.805 --> 30:49.723
Same old story.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.775
How is everything over there?

31:01.526 --> 31:06.573
Three little ants against the world, and
it seems the world is going to win.

31:06.656 --> 31:07.657
No.

31:09.117 --> 31:10.494
You arrested JPR.

31:12.579 --> 31:13.789
You're fucking amazing.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.758
I wanted to come earlier.

31:30.180 --> 31:31.723
I wanted you to be there with me.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.399
They say they will send
everything to Brasília.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.695
Same old story.

31:48.907 --> 31:52.327
FEDERAL COURT

32:17.853 --> 32:19.020
It can't go to Brasília.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.898
You know what happens in Brasília.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.861
- You owe me.
- I owe you nothing.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.195
You don't?

32:27.279 --> 32:28.738
- No, I don't.
- You don't?

32:31.366 --> 32:32.200
You don't.

32:58.143 --> 33:01.813
Honey, take a sleeping pill.

33:03.190 --> 33:05.317
You won't solve anything right now.

33:07.027 --> 33:08.278
Take something, Paulo.

33:10.030 --> 33:11.114
Go.

33:36.515 --> 33:40.435
Never in the history of this country
had a first instance judge changed

33:40.519 --> 33:42.270
a decision made by the Supreme Court.

33:43.104 --> 33:44.439
So why this time?

33:49.819 --> 33:52.864
The Wizard knew that if the
case was moved to Brasília,

33:53.198 --> 33:56.368
JPR would get away with it and
wouldn't denounce a single person.

34:08.463 --> 34:09.630
Call home.

34:11.841 --> 34:12.967
Calm your family down.

34:14.427 --> 34:16.179
They let you in with a cell phone?

34:19.683 --> 34:22.561
Pretend you're OK. Say
you've been sleeping well.

34:23.645 --> 34:25.813
That the food is way
better than you thought.

34:28.275 --> 34:29.442
They will get used to it.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.112
It's harder in the beginning.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.699
But I won't stay here.

34:38.118 --> 34:39.536
You're a family guy, Pepê.

34:40.453 --> 34:43.998
Just because you're in here, doesn't
mean you can't take care of them.

34:46.001 --> 34:47.835
Go to that corner, below the camera.

34:52.549 --> 34:55.092
- And financially?
- I have some money for now.

34:55.677 --> 34:58.305
I ran to the bank. The manager
helped me get some money.

34:58.388 --> 34:59.264
It's clear so far.

34:59.848 --> 35:02.142
They can't touch our retirement account.

35:02.225 --> 35:04.644
But I don't know how long
it will last, João Pedro.

35:04.728 --> 35:06.354
Ask him if they asked about us.

35:06.980 --> 35:08.315
Ask him, Mom.

35:08.398 --> 35:10.108
I have a young boy to raise.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.443
The nanny can't go to jail.

35:11.526 --> 35:15.822
No one said, "You're doing this, it
could go wrong and get you in trouble."

35:15.905 --> 35:16.740
Easy to say now.

35:16.823 --> 35:19.534
I think I should use that in my defense.
It's different.

35:19.618 --> 35:22.078
- Your defense?
- I didn't know. It's different.

35:22.162 --> 35:24.664
João Pedro, ask how much
this lawyer will charge us.

35:24.748 --> 35:26.041
It has to be a good one.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.792
It's premature!

35:27.876 --> 35:29.044
Listen to me.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.129
Our accounts are frozen, they took cars,

35:31.212 --> 35:34.466
the house, the Evoque, you're in jail...

35:34.549 --> 35:36.760
Listen, ask how much
this lawyer will charge

35:36.843 --> 35:38.970
because I'm the one who
has to find the money.

35:39.554 --> 35:42.641
And I'm not selling my
Afonso Renato jewels.

35:44.684 --> 35:45.685
Shit.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.736
You need to get me some clonazepam.

35:55.779 --> 35:56.988
I know you can do it.

35:57.072 --> 35:59.491
- Get me one.
- She'll calm down.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.201
She's angry, but will calm down.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.537
Everyone has to keep their own focus.

36:05.872 --> 36:06.706
That's it.

36:06.790 --> 36:09.584
Her focus is saving as
much money as she can.

36:10.502 --> 36:11.795
Yours is keeping quiet.

36:14.214 --> 36:16.883
They want to break us, so they
can get to the big shots.

36:18.051 --> 36:19.052
So we talk.

36:19.636 --> 36:22.430
The big shots team up and
we're the ones who go down.

36:27.560 --> 36:30.897
Now, be quiet. Understood?

36:33.149 --> 36:34.025
It will pass.

36:35.485 --> 36:36.319
It will pass.

36:37.070 --> 36:37.904
It will pass.

36:48.415 --> 36:49.249
Yeah.

36:49.708 --> 36:53.128
Anyone with three million at home
will have a lot more abroad.

36:54.421 --> 36:56.089
We just need to find out where.

36:57.257 --> 37:00.552
If this guy cracks, Ibrahim
will stay in jail forever.

37:00.635 --> 37:02.721
How do we get him to talk?

37:03.596 --> 37:06.474
Go to the Federal Police.
Bring me everything you can.

37:06.558 --> 37:07.392
I'll find a way.

37:07.475 --> 37:10.645
You know it's not that easy
to take things out of there.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.856
If it were easy I'd ask
your dumbass cousin.

37:13.398 --> 37:15.650
That's why I asked you, Mr.
Miyagi, Samurai.

37:16.276 --> 37:19.112
Go there at night, take
some photos, some copies...

37:19.195 --> 37:22.073
Store them on a pen drive.
I'm going to break this guy.

37:28.788 --> 37:31.750
Marco! Open up!

37:34.085 --> 37:37.338
- Why lock the damn door?
- I'm working.

37:37.422 --> 37:39.883
Hi. I didn?t know you were here.

37:39.966 --> 37:41.468
- How are you?
- Good!

37:41.968 --> 37:43.011
Hungry?

37:43.094 --> 37:44.971
- No, thanks. I'm good.
- No?

37:47.474 --> 37:49.392
Liana, come here, please.

37:51.978 --> 37:53.271
How can I help?

37:53.354 --> 37:55.982
Sort the congressmen's
material to send to court.

37:56.065 --> 37:57.901
Just their part, sir?

37:57.984 --> 38:00.862
Yes, detach the ones with
jurisdictional privileges.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.322
Is there a precedent?

38:02.405 --> 38:05.867
No precedent. But it's well grounded.

38:06.451 --> 38:07.327
OK.

38:10.413 --> 38:12.916
Brazil is not for the faint-hearted.

38:14.209 --> 38:16.795
Why is it that in Brazil,
history keeps repeating itself?

38:18.296 --> 38:19.422
The state bank...

38:20.882 --> 38:23.843
It's what happened with
all the other scandals.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.970
And it's going to happen again.

38:27.514 --> 38:31.226
The old vultures in Brasília
always find a way to shut us up.

38:32.519 --> 38:34.437
Judge Rigo already lost this battle.

38:35.230 --> 38:39.234
Over half of those judges were
nominated by this government.

38:40.443 --> 38:42.111
If the case goes to Brasília,

38:42.612 --> 38:43.696
it's over.

38:44.364 --> 38:46.074
JPR will go free and unscathed.

38:48.576 --> 38:50.370
They make our lives a living hell.

38:50.912 --> 38:52.914
And I'll make theirs hell, too.

38:52.997 --> 38:54.457
We'll be even.

38:55.959 --> 38:59.003
I'll find a way to
incriminate JPR before that.

39:00.046 --> 39:02.173
He's too weak to handle prison.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.051
He's going to break.

39:07.554 --> 39:08.596
And if he talks...

39:10.765 --> 39:14.352
If he talks, the Republic crumbles.
