     Uh, doesn't that mean      
you have to do something?       

01:08.400 --> 01:11.469
  No, it's my reminder timer.

      that in five minutes

         Hello, Archie.         

02:05.692 --> 02:07.192
How was your day?               

02:07.194 --> 02:10.461
                Oh, Edith,      
            my day was great.   

02:10.463 --> 02:13.198
Oh, did                         
something good happen?

            No, Edith, I mean,  
          nothing good happened.

02:15.001 --> 02:16.334
                I mean,         
              this is New York.

        If nothing bad happens, 
        it's a great day, right?

02:19.606 --> 02:21.405

              this morning,     

02:21.407 --> 02:23.775
              and... it went.

          was when the oil from 
         your tuna fish sandwich

02:26.980 --> 02:31.182
             didn't leak through
              onto my Twinkies. 

02:31.184 --> 02:32.984
                 Then to top off
                 the whole day, 

02:32.986 --> 02:35.019
        I won a buck bet from   
            Stretch Cunningham. 

02:35.021 --> 02:36.454
How did you do that?            

02:36.456 --> 02:37.989
         Wait till you hear.    

02:37.991 --> 02:39.858
     We was all sitting around  
     at lunchtime talking, see, 

02:39.860 --> 02:41.092
    and I says to Stretch,      

02:41.094 --> 02:42.560
        "Hey, I was watching    
        a bowling tournament.   

02:42.562 --> 02:44.629

        he bowled 301."

        "That can't be."        

02:45.866 --> 02:47.265

        bets me a buck.

    tell Stretch the truth,

      the man bowled 301.

  No, I didn't mean "one" one.  
I meant him, the guy, won.

  Then why didn't you explain   
        that to Stretch?

     I mean, Adam and Eve,      

07:44.597 --> 07:46.197

        out in paradise.

satisfied with that, see?       

07:53.273 --> 07:54.939
    And then one day,           
     against direct orders,     

07:54.941 --> 07:57.275
    she made poor Adam          
        eat that apple.         

07:57.277 --> 07:58.609

Hey, Edith...                   

13:24.637 --> 13:27.872
              Not now, Archie.  
            I ain't in the mood.

13:38.216 --> 13:40.484
For what?                       

13:42.888 --> 13:45.322
                  For nothing.  
            Go back to sleep.   

13:45.324 --> 13:46.624
        How can I sleep         

13:46.626 --> 13:48.291
with all the noise you're       
          making here?          

13:48.293 --> 13:51.962
  You're heaving enough sighs   
to blow up an inner tube.       

13:51.964 --> 13:58.035
            I'm sorry, Archie,  
         but I just can't sleep.

13:58.037 --> 14:00.203
Well, why don't you             
get it off your chest?          

14:00.205 --> 14:03.240
What happened                   
between you and Gloria?         

14:03.242 --> 14:06.877
                  I can't talk  
            about it, Archie.   

14:06.879 --> 14:08.145
Well, don't you want me         

14:08.147 --> 14:09.580
to help you                     
with the problem?               

14:09.582 --> 14:11.181
                 Oh, yeah.      

14:11.183 --> 14:14.652
[GENTLY] Well, then just tell me
      what the problem is.      

14:14.654 --> 14:15.920
     [RUDELY] I'll tell you     
          "Forget it,"          

14:15.922 --> 14:17.788
  and we'll both go to sleep!   

14:19.490 --> 14:22.860
    No, I can't, Archie,        

14:22.862 --> 14:24.828
             but I'll try not to
             bother you no more.

14:24.830 --> 14:26.830
Please, huh?                    

14:26.832 --> 14:28.866
Jeez.                           

14:28.868 --> 14:30.467
[GROANS]                        

14:32.270 --> 14:34.071
                  [GASPS]       

14:34.073 --> 14:35.806
What?!                          

14:37.909 --> 14:42.145
            Archie, do you think
            I'm a nothing?      

14:42.147 --> 14:43.847
What kind                       
of a question is that           

14:43.849 --> 14:46.617
to ask me                       
at 2:30 in the morning?         

14:46.619 --> 14:48.719
                  Oh, I'm sorry.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.755
             "Nothing" just came
                into my mind.   

14:53.024 --> 14:55.459
    It must have felt           
      right at home there.      

14:58.730 --> 15:00.965
         I don't understand you.
         Why can't you tell me? 

15:00.967 --> 15:02.566
         I mean, isn't that what
             a husband's for,   

15:02.568 --> 15:03.801
    to talk things over with?   

15:03.803 --> 15:05.903
A husband's also for shutting up

15:05.905 --> 15:07.671
     when his wife doesn't      
    feel like talking.          

15:07.673 --> 15:09.974
        I'm gonna ignore        
        that last remark,       

15:09.976 --> 15:11.842
because I know you only said it 

15:11.844 --> 15:13.043
because you're not feeling well 

15:13.045 --> 15:14.377
 and you really didn't mean it. 

15:14.379 --> 15:16.179
     Oh, shut up, Michael.      

15:16.181 --> 15:17.581
    Now, that one you meant.    

15:17.583 --> 15:19.583
         That "shut up"         
 I didn't like at all, Gloria,  

15:19.585 --> 15:21.585
        and we're gonna         
get to the bottom of this.      

15:21.587 --> 15:22.920
We're not going to sleep.       

15:22.922 --> 15:25.322
    You tell me why you got     
 into a fight with your mother! 

15:25.324 --> 15:26.556
      Because I love her.       

15:26.558 --> 15:27.691
                What?           

15:27.693 --> 15:30.027
    I felt I had to tell her    
    the truth about herself.    

15:30.029 --> 15:32.229
    Oh, and because of that,    
 now she's not speaking to you? 

15:32.231 --> 15:33.497
     [MOCKING MICHAEL] Yes.     

15:33.499 --> 15:35.833
      Oh, come on, Gloria.      

15:35.835 --> 15:37.601
What are you trying to tell me? 

15:37.603 --> 15:38.902
             I know your mother.

15:38.904 --> 15:40.704
    I've been living with her   
          for over two years.   

15:40.706 --> 15:41.805
        She's a marvelous woman.

15:41.807 --> 15:43.373
    Are you saying I'm not?     

15:43.375 --> 15:45.242
    No, no, I'm not saying that,
             but, uh...         

15:45.244 --> 15:46.376
    [MOCKING MICHAEL]           
        "But, uh" what?         

15:46.378 --> 15:47.811
        But, uh...              

15:47.813 --> 15:49.647
  "But, uh" what? What? What?   
        But what?               

15:49.649 --> 15:51.181
But you're not like your mother.

15:51.183 --> 15:52.716
Well, thank God for that.       

15:52.718 --> 15:53.884
        You're like your father.

15:53.886 --> 15:55.218
             What?              

15:57.188 --> 15:59.556
        Gloria, you have a very,
        very quick temper.      

15:59.558 --> 16:01.525
        Sometimes you're given  
     to some very nasty remarks.

16:01.527 --> 16:04.227
  Okay, Michael, so you don't   
      like the way I talk.      

16:04.229 --> 16:05.629
    What else don't you like    
        about me?               

16:05.631 --> 16:06.897
            Nothing, nothing.   

16:06.899 --> 16:08.932
      Some of your nasty remarks
            are very cute.      

16:08.934 --> 16:10.134
    Oh, ho...                   

16:10.136 --> 16:13.370
Okay...                         
I got a nasty temper.

What else is                    
wrong with me?

              time to stand here

16:16.308 --> 16:17.908
            and make a list     
             of all your faults.

16:17.910 --> 16:21.211
Oh! I got so many faults        
you can't list them, huh?       

16:21.213 --> 16:22.412
I must be a real mess.          

16:22.414 --> 16:23.613
Is that what                    
you're saying, Michael?         

16:23.615 --> 16:24.614
Is that what you're saying

                I don't think   

16:36.929 --> 16:38.461
                you should      
            listen like that.   

16:38.463 --> 16:39.897
  This is the best way.         

16:39.899 --> 16:42.966
  You can hear better           
    through a glass.            

16:42.968 --> 16:45.936
            I mean,             
what they're saying is private.

Oh, well, if it stays           
on their side, it's all right,  

16:48.941 --> 16:51.374
but anything that leaks         
through my wall into my room,   

16:51.376 --> 16:53.243
     I can listen to.

                    I was right.
                    I was right.

16:55.047 --> 16:56.279
              When you talk like
                 that, you're

                as your father!

                 for listening.
