(frogs croaking)

00:08.880 --> 00:11.380
(creepy music plays)

00:11.380 --> 00:12.620
Where are we?

00:12.620 --> 00:14.460
We came through
the portal,

00:14.460 --> 00:17.330
so... we must be
in the Topsy Turvy World...

00:17.330 --> 00:19.830
where the Nerdidorken lurks.

00:19.830 --> 00:21.540
How do we know
that monster is even real?

00:21.540 --> 00:23.880
-(roars)
-(kids scream)

00:23.880 --> 00:27.540
-(screaming)
-He's real! He's real!

00:27.540 --> 00:31.500
-Shh.
-Dude, we've seen
this 12 times.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.040
(whimpers)

00:33.040 --> 00:34.460
(blows nose)

00:34.460 --> 00:36.380
Is that your
tooth-wiggling finger?

00:37.540 --> 00:38.960
(smacks) Yes.

00:38.960 --> 00:41.170
-Eww!
-It's all yours.

00:41.170 --> 00:43.460
-(sneezes)
-(chuckles)

00:43.460 --> 00:45.500
Now it's all yours.

00:45.500 --> 00:49.040
I'm sorry!
I think this cold
is getting worse.

00:49.040 --> 00:52.500
I'm worried about getting
on that plane to visit
my aunt on Tuesday.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.170
Ah-achoo!

00:56.460 --> 00:58.670
Ooh! It's buttered!

00:58.670 --> 01:00.000
It is now.

01:01.710 --> 01:04.460
I can't believe
the Nerdidorken
has got Lil' Pete.

01:04.460 --> 01:07.040
Forget Lil' Pete!
We need to find
the portal back home!

01:07.040 --> 01:09.000
We can't just leave
Lil' Pete behind!

01:09.000 --> 01:11.040
-(roars)
-(kids on TV scream)

01:11.040 --> 01:13.330
Get out of my living room
so I can get my hair done.

01:13.330 --> 01:16.960
Yo, Ma! Lil' Pete just got
taken by the Nerdidorken!

01:16.960 --> 01:20.210
-The Nerdi-what-ken?
-The Nerdidorken,
from our favorite show,

01:20.210 --> 01:21.460
Weirder Things.

01:21.460 --> 01:24.460
Kids:
The truth lies below.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.380
-(chuckles)
-Remember, we won tickets

01:26.380 --> 01:28.040
to the sneak peek
of the season three premiere.

01:28.040 --> 01:30.250
We get to meet the cast
and find out what happened

01:30.250 --> 01:32.290
to Lil' Pete before
any of our friends.

01:32.290 --> 01:34.540
But we need to rewatch
all of season two first.

01:34.540 --> 01:36.000
Ooh! That's a lot
of information for me

01:36.000 --> 01:37.620
to just tell
y'all to get out
of my living room.

01:37.620 --> 01:40.830
-But, Mom!
-It is my weave day.

01:40.830 --> 01:43.290
Come on, y'all.
We talked about this
yesterday, remember?

01:44.620 --> 01:46.620
-Hey, kids.
-Hey, Ma.

01:46.620 --> 01:49.120
Now listen, tomorrow
I'm gonna need you

01:49.120 --> 01:51.120
to stay... wabba wah,
wabba wah, wah, wah.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.040
Wabba wah.
Wah, wah, wah,

01:53.040 --> 01:55.210
Wabba sa wah,
wabba sa wah.

01:55.210 --> 01:57.250
-Are you listening to me?
-Yeah, okay.

01:57.250 --> 01:58.330
Mm-hmm.

01:58.330 --> 01:59.790
-I don't remember that.
-Doesn't ring a bell.

01:59.790 --> 02:01.960
You kids need
to learn to listen.

02:01.960 --> 02:05.170
Seriously. Your faces are
either glued to your phone,

02:05.170 --> 02:07.580
your tablets,
your computer
or this show!

02:07.580 --> 02:11.500
Now please vacate
my weave zone,

Whoopi today.

No, no. (gasps) Nicki.

03:17.920 --> 03:19.880
Just a little Nicki.

It's her! (pants)

(gasps)

03:28.250 --> 03:30.250
It's not a dream.
It's a nightmare.

03:30.250 --> 03:32.080
Nice to see you too.

03:33.580 --> 03:34.880
What do you want, Mitch?

03:34.880 --> 03:37.540
As your landlord,
my dad wants me

03:37.540 --> 03:39.500
to check for leaks
in your apartment.

03:39.500 --> 03:40.710
It's not even raining.

03:40.710 --> 03:42.960
It will eventually.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.460
I'll start
with Booker's room.

03:44.460 --> 03:45.620
All right,
do whatever you want.

03:45.620 --> 03:47.330
just get out of my weave zone!

03:47.330 --> 03:50.000
Fine! And if you're selling
hair in here,

03:50.000 --> 03:51.330
I better get a cut.

03:51.330 --> 03:53.250
No cut for you, Mitch!
Get out!

03:53.250 --> 03:54.750
Get out!

03:54.750 --> 03:56.670
Don't worry, ladies,
I would never sell you.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.580
I would never sell you.
I'm sorry.

03:58.580 --> 04:01.380
All right, back
to Weirder Things.

04:01.380 --> 04:03.120
Yes! (laughs)

04:03.120 --> 04:05.540
Hello, losers!

04:05.540 --> 04:06.710
-(groans)
-Come on!

04:06.710 --> 04:10.170
Whoa. Is that
Weirder Things?

04:10.170 --> 04:11.580
What do you want, Mitch?

04:11.580 --> 04:13.330
This is
my favorite show!

04:13.330 --> 04:14.790
My dad even let me...

04:14.790 --> 04:17.580
wah, wah, wah,
wah, wah, wah, wah,

04:17.580 --> 04:19.540
wah, wah, wah, wah, wah!

04:19.540 --> 04:23.380
(laughs)
My baby tooth came out!

04:23.380 --> 04:25.880
You still have
baby teeth? Ha!

04:25.880 --> 04:27.750
Uh, not anymore.

04:27.750 --> 04:30.080
This is my last one.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.000
It's a man's
mouth now, brah.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.250
-Ooh.
-(phone beeps)

04:35.330 --> 04:37.250
-Oh man!
-Booker and Levi: What?

04:37.250 --> 04:39.000
My mom can't drive us
to the premiere

04:39.000 --> 04:40.880
because her driving foot
fell asleep.

04:40.880 --> 04:41.920
Well, wake it up.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.750
No way!

04:43.750 --> 04:44.880
Last time I tried that,

04:44.880 --> 04:47.250
my hands smelled like
corn chips for a week!

04:47.250 --> 04:48.540
Eww!

04:48.540 --> 04:50.540
Your dad's a lucky man.

04:51.790 --> 04:53.710
And what premiere?

04:53.710 --> 04:57.750
We won four tickets
to the season three premiere
of Weirder Things.

04:57.750 --> 05:00.290
But there are five of us.

05:00.290 --> 05:01.880
-Guess you're out.
-(scoffs)

05:01.880 --> 05:03.750
Group:
Bye, Mitch!

05:03.750 --> 05:07.290
Fine! Good luck finding
a ride, losers! Ha!

05:08.620 --> 05:10.710
How are we gonna get
to the premiere by four o'clock?

05:10.710 --> 05:13.420
Yeah, today's
Mom's weave day.

05:13.420 --> 05:14.750
She probably won't
be done by then.

05:14.750 --> 05:17.210
Are you forgetting you
guys have a spare Mom?

05:17.210 --> 05:19.750
(snaps fingers)
Oh yeah, the sneeze queen
can drive us!

05:19.750 --> 05:21.620
-I'll go ask her.
-I'll come with you.

05:21.620 --> 05:24.830
Hopefully, I'll get sick.
I got a geography test
on Monday.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.380
(blows nose, coughs)

05:32.710 --> 05:34.290
Whoa! She's burning up.

05:34.290 --> 05:36.710
-You should probably
take a step back.
-I'm good.

05:36.710 --> 05:39.000
I'm really bad
at geography.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.670
Come on, germs.
I'm counting on ya.

05:40.670 --> 05:43.080
-(inhales deeply)
-Oh! There you are! Oh!

05:43.080 --> 05:46.380
I've been pressing
the flight attendant button
for like 20 minutes.

05:46.380 --> 05:47.830
What is she
even talking about?

05:47.830 --> 05:49.790
Whenever she gets
a high fever,

05:49.790 --> 05:52.710
it just makes whatever
she's worried about
even worse.

05:52.710 --> 05:54.750
Oh! That's right,
she was worried
about flying.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.960
Flight attendant!
Flight attendant.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.120
I'll take a hot tea
with lemon, please.

06:00.170 --> 06:01.710
We're not
flight attendants.

06:01.710 --> 06:03.790
-There are
no flight attendants.
-What?

06:03.790 --> 06:05.580
No flight attendants?

06:05.580 --> 06:07.380
What kind
of airline is this?

06:07.380 --> 06:10.790
Huh? Well, it's a good thing
I used to waitress.

06:10.790 --> 06:12.210
I'll just get
the drink cart.

06:12.210 --> 06:14.670
(clears throat, laughs)

06:14.670 --> 06:18.290
What am I thinking?
This isn't a drink cart!

06:18.290 --> 06:20.210
-(laughs)
-Yeah! She must
be coming out of it.

06:20.210 --> 06:22.460
This-- this is
the drink cart.

06:22.460 --> 06:25.250
-Nope.
-Coffee? Huh? Tea?

06:26.460 --> 06:28.790
-(doorbell rings)
-Ah!

06:28.790 --> 06:30.380
(squeals)

06:30.380 --> 06:32.040
(gasps)

06:32.040 --> 06:34.750
Kema... the Dreamweaver.

06:34.750 --> 06:35.710
Remove it.

06:37.380 --> 06:38.540
Listen, now prepare yourself.

06:38.540 --> 06:40.040
I haven't been able
to do my hair all week.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.710
Come on, boo-boo.
I've seen it all.

06:41.710 --> 06:42.790
-You ready?
-I'm ready.

06:42.790 --> 06:44.380
-I don't think you're ready.
-Oh, I'm ready.

06:44.380 --> 06:45.710
(yelps)

06:46.580 --> 06:48.670
-You right.
I wasn't ready.
-Ah!

06:48.670 --> 06:50.920
Girl! Did you lose
your comb in the divorce?

06:50.920 --> 06:52.540
-Yes!
-Oh.

06:52.540 --> 06:54.790
But I gained
two kids and a car note,
so here we are.

06:54.790 --> 06:56.790
Ooh! It's okay,
boo-boo.

06:56.790 --> 06:58.040
-I got you.
-Okay.

06:58.040 --> 06:59.880
And I also got
a babysitting job
later today.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.580
-When?
-Now. Get in here,
baby girl!

07:03.620 --> 07:05.330
This is my niece, Power!

07:05.330 --> 07:08.170
My name's Power,
because of my powerful moves!

07:08.170 --> 07:10.710
-Yes, honey!
Get 'em. Get 'em.
-(laughs)

07:10.710 --> 07:12.710
Break it down.
Unh! Get it!

07:12.710 --> 07:15.710
Oh! Oh yeah, take it!
Oh yeah, take it! Ooh!

07:15.710 --> 07:18.000
Ooh, ooh!
(grunting)

07:18.000 --> 07:19.880
Oh, oh, oh! Yes!

07:19.880 --> 07:22.420
I want one!
I want another one!

07:22.420 --> 07:24.620
-Mom!
-Never mind.

07:24.620 --> 07:25.620
Kema:
Okay.

07:25.620 --> 07:26.880
You gotta help us.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.080
Tess's mom
has sleepy foot.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.880
My cousin's
got sleepy eye.

07:31.170 --> 07:34.170
And Aunt Chelsea
can't drive us, either.

07:34.170 --> 07:36.210
She's too sick,
so we need you
to drive us

07:36.210 --> 07:37.750
to the Weirder Things
premiere today.

07:37.750 --> 07:41.290
Oh. Well, what you need is
to get out of my weave zone.

07:41.290 --> 07:43.500
Both:
Mom, please.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.500
All right,
okay, okay, listen.

07:46.420 --> 07:48.880
Here. If you stay
out of my hair,

07:48.880 --> 07:50.920
literally, for the next
five hours...

07:51.920 --> 07:53.380
I'll drive you
to the premiere.

07:53.380 --> 07:55.080
-(laughs)
-Thank you, Mom.

07:55.080 --> 07:58.290
That's only if Kema
finishes my weave first.

07:58.290 --> 08:00.670
Oh, I'll be finished,
long as I can stay focused.

08:00.670 --> 08:03.330
Ooh. Why is
your roomie about
to eat a slipper?

08:03.330 --> 08:06.620
Oh, sometimes
she gets a little loopy
when she runs a high fever.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.620
Ladies and gentlemen,
the captain just turned
on the "Fasten Seat Belt" sign.

08:09.620 --> 08:12.460
Please take your seats.
Bing!

08:12.460 --> 08:13.920
Or a lot loopy.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.830
Ooh! I'm sorry,
I can't work right now.

08:15.830 --> 08:18.000
The crazy show is on.
I got to watch this!

08:18.000 --> 08:21.420
-Uh, show's over!
-Yeah! Come on, Aunt Crazy--

08:21.420 --> 08:23.330
Aunt Chelsea.
We'll take care of her.

08:25.830 --> 08:28.290
I thought your cousin
had drippy eye.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.880
Is sleepy eye
another cousin?

08:29.880 --> 08:31.710
Same cousin,
different eye.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.960
Is it just me...

08:38.960 --> 08:42.250
or does Mom's hair
look exactly the same?

08:42.250 --> 08:44.540
-(hip-hop music plays)
-Tess: And why is she dancing?

08:44.540 --> 08:46.080
She's supposed to be weaving.

08:46.080 --> 08:46.880
Ha!

08:48.830 --> 08:51.960
-(laughs)
-I can dance with this cutie
all day, honey!

08:53.000 --> 08:55.500
This kid's cuteness
is killing us.

08:57.210 --> 08:59.460
We'll never make it
to that premiere

08:59.460 --> 09:01.290
Guys, I got this.
Come on.

09:02.920 --> 09:06.920
OMG. Power,
you are just so adorable.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.420
Isn't she so yummy?

09:08.420 --> 09:10.920
Yes, but you can't keep all
this yumminess to yourself.

09:10.920 --> 09:14.040
We can watch Power
while you finish your weave.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.670
-Hmm!
-Please, please, please!

09:16.670 --> 09:19.000
Fine with me.
I get paid the same.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.750
-(ululates)
-(laughs)

09:21.920 --> 09:23.420
Come on,
you little angel.

09:23.420 --> 09:25.880
-Go, Power! Go, Power!
-(Weirder Things theme plays)

09:25.880 --> 09:28.330
Go, go, go, Power!

09:28.330 --> 09:29.540
Sing!

09:29.540 --> 09:33.460
(flatly)
Go, Power.
Go, Power.

09:33.460 --> 09:35.250
Please go, Power.

09:35.250 --> 09:38.170
No. You know,
Power, why don't
you hang out with us?

09:38.170 --> 09:40.670
You can watch this show,
and maybe you'll like it.

09:40.670 --> 09:41.460
Okay.

09:44.210 --> 09:46.750
It worked.
She's quiet.

09:46.750 --> 09:48.380
Yeah, this is perfect.

09:48.380 --> 09:51.920
Now she's not distracting
us or Mom.

09:51.920 --> 09:52.790
-(musical sting)
-(gasps)

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
(whimpers)

10:03.210 --> 10:04.880
Ow. Ow.

10:04.880 --> 10:06.210
Shh, shh!
Baby, I'm on the phone.

10:06.210 --> 10:08.920
-Oh, okay.
-So then what did he say?

10:08.920 --> 10:10.460
Well, then what did you do?

10:10.460 --> 10:12.920
Ooh! Girl, you should
not have done that!

10:12.920 --> 10:14.960
-(laughs)
-Ow, ow, ow!

10:14.960 --> 10:17.000
-(moans)
-Mom, I need to call you back.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.920
-You okay, boo-boo?
-Oh, the pain is worth it.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.080
I'll just say the code word
if it gets any worse.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.080
Auntie Kema,
I'm hungry!

10:24.080 --> 10:27.000
-One minute, baby!
-Oh, home skillet biscuit!

10:27.000 --> 10:29.040
Girl, I love me some
home skillet biscuits.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.290
No, no, that's the code word!

10:30.290 --> 10:31.880
Kema, that's the code word!

10:31.880 --> 10:34.420
-Oh my edge.
-(pans clattering)

10:34.420 --> 10:36.420
Is she in my pots
and pans?

10:37.460 --> 10:38.750
Mom, there she is.

10:38.750 --> 10:40.080
Okay, sweetheart,
I'll make you some food!

10:40.080 --> 10:41.920
-No! No, Mom.
-Huh?

10:41.920 --> 10:44.000
-Sit. We will get
Power something.
-Okay.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.330
Yeah, you just, uh,
you just focus on getting
beautiful...er.

10:48.330 --> 10:50.000
Nice save.

10:50.960 --> 10:53.960
Now, in the event
of a loss in cabin pressure,

10:53.960 --> 10:56.500
please be sure
to secure your
own oxygen mask

10:56.500 --> 10:57.920
before helping others.

10:59.750 --> 11:01.580
I'll get Power,
you get Aunt Chelsea.

11:01.580 --> 11:04.250
All right, don't forget
to breathe normally!

11:06.170 --> 11:08.120
There is nothing
normal about that.

11:08.120 --> 11:09.620
-Woo.
-Girl, you know
she got the fever.

11:09.620 --> 11:11.710
Hoo-ohh! Hm-mmm!

11:15.500 --> 11:18.380
-Finally! Back
to Weirder Things!
-Woo!

11:18.380 --> 11:19.960
-Yes!
-Ha!

11:19.960 --> 11:24.120
Could you put
any more weirder things
in my sandwich?

11:24.120 --> 11:27.120
Nerdidorken (on computer):
Come in. I've been
expecting you.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.170
-Don't go in there.
-Shh!

11:30.170 --> 11:31.750
Whatever.

11:33.670 --> 11:37.290
If you don't hand
over your most
precious belongings,

11:37.290 --> 11:41.040
I will eat
your little friend.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.040
Your watch.

11:43.040 --> 11:46.920
But... that's all
I have left of my father.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.120
-Hey!
-Get out of the way!

11:50.120 --> 11:53.120
What is this garbage?
It's so fake!

11:53.120 --> 11:55.330
They should call it
Boring Things.

11:55.330 --> 11:57.120
-(gasps)
-If you're so bored,

11:57.120 --> 11:58.620
then why don't you play
with this little thing?

11:58.620 --> 12:00.170
Not my Nerdidorken!

12:00.170 --> 12:02.040
He's my favorite
action figure.

12:02.040 --> 12:04.330
Okay, you know what?
Come on, Power.

12:04.330 --> 12:06.710
If you're so bored,

12:06.710 --> 12:08.880
why don't you just
step on into my closet?

12:08.880 --> 12:11.920
-Cool!
-(chuckles)
All right!

12:11.920 --> 12:14.000
Oh! Ah.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.580
What? It's not locked.

12:18.580 --> 12:21.710
Come on, we need
to finish watching
before the premiere.

12:21.710 --> 12:23.670
-Yes. Oof.
-(Weirder Things theme plays)

12:24.920 --> 12:27.710
Hey, guys,
guess what I found.

12:27.710 --> 12:29.290
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.790
Wah, wah,
wah, wah, wah.

12:30.790 --> 12:33.250
Wah, wah,
wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

12:33.250 --> 12:34.170
Wah!

12:41.710 --> 12:44.120
Somebody help me!

12:48.750 --> 12:51.380
Oh no!
I just had a vision!

12:51.380 --> 12:53.380
Power was
in the Topsy Turvy World

12:53.380 --> 12:55.330
being held
by the Nerdidorken!

12:55.330 --> 12:57.000
Booker, it's a TV show.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Power is right
in the closet, see?

13:00.120 --> 13:02.420
Power? Power?

13:04.960 --> 13:06.080
She's gone!

13:06.080 --> 13:08.000
To the Topsy Turvy World!

13:08.000 --> 13:10.080
No, Power's gotta be
in here somewhere.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.460
We just need to find her
before Auntie Rae finds out

13:12.460 --> 13:13.880
-she's missing.
-Who's missing?

13:13.880 --> 13:17.290
-Nobody!
-Um, he said...

13:17.290 --> 13:19.080
"Tooth's missing."

13:19.080 --> 13:21.420
I-- I lost
my last baby tooth.

13:21.420 --> 13:23.750
Oh! My baby got
a grown-man mouth!

13:23.750 --> 13:25.210
Ah! Where's Power?

13:25.210 --> 13:28.290
Hiding... because we are
playing hide-and-seek.

13:28.290 --> 13:30.830
Yeah, and she's
such a good hider,

13:30.830 --> 13:33.580
it's almost like
she's missing.
(chuckles)

13:35.330 --> 13:38.420
Okay. Hey,
do you guys like my hair?

13:38.420 --> 13:40.120
You're not done
already, are you?

13:40.120 --> 13:42.000
-Well, what do you think?
-(gasps)

13:42.000 --> 13:43.500
Is that your brain?

13:43.500 --> 13:45.460
-Is that my brain, Levi?
-(both scream)

13:47.000 --> 13:48.880
(laughs)

13:48.880 --> 13:50.210
Ooh, sandwich.

13:50.210 --> 13:52.750
I'm almost done,
then I'll take y'all
to the premiere.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.380
Ooh! Peanut butter
and cheese.

13:54.380 --> 13:56.250
-Can't wait!
-Thank you, Mom.

13:56.250 --> 13:57.710
Love you!

13:57.710 --> 14:00.170
-She's almost done.
We gotta find Power.
-Yeah.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.460
-Guys, check it out.
-What is that?

14:05.460 --> 14:07.290
I don't know.
It was behind those boxes.

14:07.290 --> 14:08.460
Power must've moved them.

14:08.460 --> 14:09.830
I know what it is.

14:09.830 --> 14:12.250
It's a portal
to the Topsy
Turvy World.

14:12.250 --> 14:13.620
Or it's a dumbwaiter.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.420
It's like a mini-elevator
people used to use

14:15.420 --> 14:17.080
to bring up
their groceries
in the old days.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.380
Whatever it is,
Power probably went in it,

14:19.380 --> 14:21.960
-which means
we gotta go get her.
-You're right.

14:21.960 --> 14:23.960
(deep growling)

14:23.960 --> 14:25.500
What was that?

14:25.500 --> 14:27.540
(whimpers)
It's coming
from the portal.

14:27.540 --> 14:29.080
Not a portal.

14:34.170 --> 14:36.170
The truth...

14:36.170 --> 14:37.750
lies below.

14:40.920 --> 14:43.080
(grunting)

14:44.330 --> 14:46.710
If there's really
a Nerdidorken down there,

14:46.710 --> 14:48.920
I hope someone
brought something
to fight him with.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.210
All I have is my tooth...
(grunts)

14:51.210 --> 14:52.830
...but it's sharp.

14:52.830 --> 14:55.670
You're gonna
fight a Nerdidorken
with a baby tooth?

14:55.670 --> 14:57.210
If I have to.

14:57.210 --> 14:59.080
You're not
gonna have to

14:59.080 --> 15:01.250
since there's no real
Topsy Turvy World.

15:04.540 --> 15:05.790
-(thuds)
-(grunts)

15:09.250 --> 15:12.330
(Weirder Things theme plays)

15:12.330 --> 15:14.880
-(gasps)
-You were saying?

15:14.880 --> 15:16.920
(panicked breathing)

15:18.210 --> 15:19.750
All right, Levi.
You first.

15:23.460 --> 15:27.080
Whoa! Looks exactly
like the show.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.710
Tess:
Except a lot scarier.

15:34.290 --> 15:35.960
(Nerdidorken roars)

15:35.960 --> 15:38.290
-(both scream)
-You should get
your baby tooth out!

15:41.120 --> 15:43.000
You're gonna need
a bigger tooth!

15:43.000 --> 15:44.920
-(kids scream)
-(roars)

15:46.750 --> 15:49.170
Get over here!
Get over here!

15:55.250 --> 15:57.000
-You ready?
-I'm ready!

15:57.000 --> 15:59.580
-I don't think you ready.
-I am so ready!

15:59.580 --> 16:00.750
What do ya think?

16:00.750 --> 16:03.620
(gasps)
No, no, no!

16:03.620 --> 16:05.880
Kema, I am a Scut driver,

16:05.880 --> 16:08.290
not Mariah Hairy.
I can't fit this in my car!

16:08.290 --> 16:10.250
You gots to tame
this beast, girl!

16:10.250 --> 16:12.460
Go big
or go home, girl!

16:12.460 --> 16:14.750
-I am--
-(kids' scream echoes)

16:14.750 --> 16:16.380
-Did you hear that?
-I ain't heard nothing.

16:16.380 --> 16:17.880
Chelsea:
Captain!

16:17.880 --> 16:19.830
Uh, oh, here comes
Air Cray-Cray.

16:19.830 --> 16:21.830
Captain! The passengers,

16:21.830 --> 16:23.420
-they're screaming!
-I heard that too!

16:23.420 --> 16:25.000
You gotta help me,
Chaka Khan!

16:27.380 --> 16:29.330
Where you going?
Don't try to run no game!

16:29.330 --> 16:31.420
I'm not leaving
till I get paid!

16:32.500 --> 16:34.670
Nia! Booker! Levi?

16:34.670 --> 16:37.080
Where are they?
Where are they?

16:37.080 --> 16:38.920
(gasps)
Oh no.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.420
Do you think
they went down there?

16:40.420 --> 16:43.120
Well, I don't know!
You're the one flying
this bird.

16:43.120 --> 16:45.540
Oh, how high
is your fever?

16:46.960 --> 16:48.120
(shouts)
Kids?

16:50.040 --> 16:51.790
-We have
to go down there.
-(gasps)

16:51.790 --> 16:53.620
To the cargo hold?

16:55.120 --> 16:56.290
(strained)
Sure.

16:58.330 --> 16:59.830
(sneezes)

17:02.080 --> 17:04.670
Look! It's Power!

17:04.670 --> 17:07.000
Somebody help me!

17:07.000 --> 17:08.620
Oh, it's exactly
my vision!

17:08.620 --> 17:11.170
Was the Nerdidorken nice
in your vision?

17:11.170 --> 17:13.500
(roars)

17:13.500 --> 17:15.460
Oh, it's probably
gonna eat her.

17:15.460 --> 17:18.960
Nerdidorkens love munching
on crunchy little bones!

17:18.960 --> 17:20.250
How little?

17:21.670 --> 17:24.540
-(Booker chuckles nervously)
-(Nerdidorken roars)

17:24.540 --> 17:29.120
All I want are your most
precious belongings.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.580
We'll give you what you want

17:30.580 --> 17:32.330
if you give us Power first.

17:32.330 --> 17:35.000
Hmm. Deal.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.790
(whimpers)
The Nerdidorken is
a terrible negotiator.

17:37.790 --> 17:38.830
Yeah.

17:38.830 --> 17:41.000
Now give.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.500
Stay here, Power.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.380
(whimpers)

17:46.670 --> 17:49.500
-(roars)
-(yelps)

17:49.500 --> 17:52.250
-Jess, give him your hat.
-But it's my favorite hat.

17:52.250 --> 17:54.250
Which you won't
be able to wear if you
don't have a head!

17:54.250 --> 17:55.790
Here you go!
(yelps)

17:57.750 --> 18:00.540
Here's my action figure...
of you.

18:01.830 --> 18:05.210
Here's four tickets
to the premiere
of the show that you're in.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.620
Gracias.

18:08.620 --> 18:11.750
Whoa. He knows Spanish?
De nada.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.670
More!

18:14.670 --> 18:15.750
Uh...

18:16.790 --> 18:18.750
Tooth!

18:20.330 --> 18:21.460
No.

18:22.460 --> 18:24.500
-Tooth!
-(kids scream)

18:25.710 --> 18:27.750
-No!
-(roaring)

18:27.750 --> 18:29.120
(screams)

18:32.040 --> 18:33.540
-Did you hear that, Chels?
-Yup!

18:33.540 --> 18:35.830
One of the engines
is shutting down!

18:35.830 --> 18:37.420
Okay, I'm just gonna
go with this one.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.750
That's right, stewardess.
That's what's happening.

18:39.750 --> 18:42.500
No, it's "flight attendant."

18:42.500 --> 18:45.210
-Booker, it's
just a baby tooth.
-Just give it to him!

18:45.210 --> 18:47.120
If you're not gonna
give it to him, I will!

18:47.120 --> 18:48.290
-No!
-(roars)

18:48.290 --> 18:49.460
I'm sorry.

18:50.620 --> 18:53.000
This isn't just
a baby tooth!

18:54.080 --> 18:55.960
It's the last piece
of the old me.

18:56.920 --> 18:58.170
And I wanna keep it.

18:58.170 --> 18:59.620
(Nerdidorken snarls)

18:59.620 --> 19:01.710
Okay. Fine.

19:01.710 --> 19:03.540
-I'll-- I'll give it to him.
-Nia: Yes.

19:03.540 --> 19:05.380
-Thank you.
-(growling)

19:06.460 --> 19:08.620
Now brace
for a sudden drop
in altitude!

19:08.620 --> 19:10.620
-We're not dropping anywhere!
-(rope snaps)

19:10.620 --> 19:13.580
-Oh snap!
-(both scream)

19:15.500 --> 19:16.620
(roars)

19:17.920 --> 19:19.000
Okay.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.290
-(dumbwaiter thuds)
-(kids yelp)

19:21.290 --> 19:23.880
(women groaning)

19:23.880 --> 19:25.960
Let me just turn on
the cabin lights.

19:25.960 --> 19:27.290
(switch clicks)

19:27.290 --> 19:29.620
(Mitch shouts)

19:29.620 --> 19:32.380
-(scoffs)
-That didn't sound
like a Nerdidorken.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.330
(growls
over voice-changer)

19:36.080 --> 19:37.330
It's a Mitch-idorken.

19:37.330 --> 19:38.380
Kids:
Mitch?

19:38.380 --> 19:39.460
Hello!

19:40.580 --> 19:41.880
What are you kids
doing down here?

19:41.880 --> 19:43.460
Well, we thought
we were saving Power

19:43.460 --> 19:45.000
from getting eaten
by a Nerdidorken.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.540
Yeah. It turns out
the Topsy Turvy World is...

19:47.540 --> 19:49.170
just the boiler room.

19:49.170 --> 19:51.420
You should've seen
your faces.

19:51.420 --> 19:53.620
(mockingly)
"Ooh, he's gonna eat me."

19:53.620 --> 19:56.080
-(laughs)
-Give us back our stuff.

19:56.080 --> 19:59.040
Yeah, I can't believe
you made all this
just to scare us.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.290
-I didn't.
-Then why'd you do it?

20:01.290 --> 20:03.580
I told you.
Don't you remember?

20:03.580 --> 20:06.580
Whoa. Is that
Weirder Things?

20:06.580 --> 20:08.580
This is my favorite show.

20:08.580 --> 20:10.250
My dad even let me build

20:10.250 --> 20:12.580
the Topsy Turvy World
down in the boiler room.

20:12.580 --> 20:14.330
Wanna come down
and check it out?

20:14.330 --> 20:16.460
-I don't remember that.
-Neither do I.

20:16.460 --> 20:17.460
You were nice?

20:18.670 --> 20:20.670
So, when we didn't
hang out with you,

20:20.670 --> 20:22.580
-is that when
you took Power?
-Yeah.

20:22.580 --> 20:25.620
He didn't take me!
I told you guys
where I went!

20:25.620 --> 20:27.330
You did?

20:27.330 --> 20:29.620
Hey, guys,
guess what I found!

20:29.620 --> 20:32.170
A secret door.
I'm going inside it,

20:32.170 --> 20:34.620
so you may never
see me again. Bye!

20:36.960 --> 20:38.620
-I don't remember that.
-Huh.

20:38.620 --> 20:42.000
See? This is exactly
what I was talking about.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.170
I told you kids
you do not listen.

20:45.170 --> 20:46.620
You tuned
into your show,

20:46.620 --> 20:49.380
and you tuned
everybody else out!

20:49.380 --> 20:51.960
Now, if you were
paying attention,
you would've heard Mitch,

20:51.960 --> 20:54.540
Power wouldn't
have snuck out,

20:54.540 --> 20:56.670
my weave
would've been done...

20:57.710 --> 20:59.580
and y'all would've been
on your way to the premiere.

20:59.580 --> 21:01.500
But guess what.
Now you're not.

21:03.170 --> 21:06.210
We-- we apologize.
Mom, you're right.

21:06.210 --> 21:08.040
We didn't listen.

21:08.040 --> 21:11.500
You're really
gonna miss the premiere
of Weirder Things?

21:11.500 --> 21:13.540
Yeah. It's okay.

21:13.540 --> 21:17.330
The only thing
better than watching
Weirder Things,

21:17.330 --> 21:18.960
-is living it.
-(chuckles)

21:18.960 --> 21:21.250
Yeah, we'd be cool
just hanging here.

21:21.250 --> 21:22.960
With me?

21:24.080 --> 21:25.250
Yeah.

21:26.460 --> 21:28.120
You're okay, Mitch.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.670
You guys are okay, too.

21:29.670 --> 21:32.250
You kids have a great time
playing down here.

21:32.250 --> 21:33.790
I've gotta put
a flat iron in this hair.

21:33.790 --> 21:35.790
And I've got
a plane to land!

21:37.540 --> 21:40.250
All right. Well, I'm gonna
take Captain Cray-Cray
to bed first. Come on.

21:41.460 --> 21:43.670
So, do you guys wanna
act out another episode?

21:43.670 --> 21:45.670
You losers can do
whatever you want.

21:45.670 --> 21:49.420
I just got four tickets
to the premiere
of Weirder Things!

21:49.420 --> 21:51.750
Uh, no you don't.
They're still
on my phone.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.290
Check again.

21:53.290 --> 21:56.670
I transferred them
to my phone when
you weren't looking.

21:56.670 --> 21:58.830
See ya
on the red carpet.

21:58.830 --> 22:01.080
Oh, that's right. (laughs)

22:01.080 --> 22:04.420
I won't! Ha!
Baby tooth!

22:09.500 --> 22:11.540
So, you guys wanna
act out episode two?

22:11.540 --> 22:13.420
-I get to be
the Nerdidorken.
-No, me!

22:13.420 --> 22:14.880
-No, I wanna do it.
-I'm the scariest.

22:14.880 --> 22:18.710
(over voice-changer)
Too late! I'm the Nerdidorken!

22:19.710 --> 22:22.000
(kids scream)

22:22.000 --> 22:24.710
(sneezes)
Yes! I got her cold!

22:24.710 --> 22:26.380
(Power growls)

22:30.080 --> 22:31.290
-Captain?
-Yes?

22:31.290 --> 22:32.580
Prepare for landing.

22:32.580 --> 22:34.000
Aye-aye, Co-Captain.

22:35.250 --> 22:36.290
(chuckles)

22:37.620 --> 22:38.960
-Uh-oh, uh-oh!
-Uh-oh.

22:38.960 --> 22:40.210
Oh no,
we're nose-diving.

22:40.210 --> 22:41.830
-Oh no!
-Oh, the controls are stuck!

22:41.830 --> 22:43.670
-Oh! Oh!
-I can't pull it up!

22:43.670 --> 22:45.880
Mayday! Mayday!

22:45.880 --> 22:47.830
Okay, okay, Co-Captain!
I got it!

22:47.830 --> 22:49.080
Pull up! Pull up!

22:50.120 --> 22:52.580
(both grunt)

22:52.580 --> 22:55.290
Oh, phew! That was a close one.

22:55.290 --> 22:57.460
Yeah, that was crazy.

22:57.460 --> 23:00.500
Rae, I can't believe
you posted this!

23:00.500 --> 23:01.830
I look crazy!

23:01.830 --> 23:03.880
Yeah, but I look crazy good.

23:03.880 --> 23:06.170
My edges are laid, honey. Ah.

23:06.170 --> 23:08.750
(laughs, gasps)
I got 8,000 hits! Gimme that!

23:08.750 --> 23:10.620
(babbles excitedly)
