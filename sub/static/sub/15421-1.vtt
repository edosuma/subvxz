2- speed 250,
mile radius 2-3-0.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.966
Both sides...

00:36.703 --> 00:38.637
We've talked
to the military.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.639
They've escorted it down.

00:40.707 --> 00:43.141
There appears to be
a potential...

00:43.209 --> 00:45.837
It looked like
a door was opening...

00:45.912 --> 00:47.937
This is not a hoax.

00:48.014 --> 00:49.845
That is real
out there.

00:49.916 --> 00:52.817
That was the scene
in California's Mojave Desert

00:52.886 --> 00:55.320
three years ago today-

00:55.388 --> 00:58.721
the frst view ofthe Newcomer ship
upon its arrival.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.726
These Newcomers,
we soon learned,

01:00.794 --> 01:02.659
were a genetically
engineered race

01:02.729 --> 01:04.663
adapted for hard labor

01:04.730 --> 01:06.665
in almost any
environmental condition.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.998
In effect, their ship
was a slave ship,

01:10.070 --> 01:12.004
washed ashore on Earth

01:12.072 --> 01:14.768
with no way to return
to where they came from.

01:14.841 --> 01:17.173
Now that attorneys
have successfully lobbied

01:17.243 --> 01:19.677
for the Newcomers '
release from quarantine,

01:19.746 --> 01:22.510
what are the reactions
among the communities?

01:22.582 --> 01:26.177
Why us?
Why can't they go to Russia?

01:26.252 --> 01:28.880
I'll drink
to that.

01:28.955 --> 01:32.686
I'll be going to school
with 9- or 10-year-olds.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.693
There goes
myjob future.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.695
I have to
compete with-

01:36.763 --> 01:39.527
Ifa 10-year old
is twice as smart,

01:39.599 --> 01:41.226
I'll be working here.

01:41.301 --> 01:44.202
By far the strongest
words ofacceptance

01:44.270 --> 01:46.704
came from
then-President Ronald Reagan.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.037
We've come to
a turning point...

01:49.109 --> 01:50.906
a moment
for hard decisions.

01:50.977 --> 01:53.946
If not us... who?

01:54.013 --> 01:56.447
And ifnot now... when?

01:56.516 --> 01:59.041
Hey, Henry,
how you doi n' tonight?.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.552
You working hard?.

02:00.620 --> 02:04.647
Hey, you got
your green card, buddy?.

02:19.038 --> 02:20.801
Slagtown.
I hate this place.

02:20.874 --> 02:22.933
Look at that geek.

02:23.009 --> 02:24.237
I hate it.

02:24.310 --> 02:27.802
Look at this crap.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.850
I wonder iftheir
plumbing's the same.

02:30.917 --> 02:32.350
Yeah, it is.

02:32.418 --> 02:33.510
What?.

02:33.586 --> 02:35.645
Oh, man,
get out ofhere.

02:35.722 --> 02:36.848
Ugh.

02:36.923 --> 02:39.118
I don't trust 'em,
that's all.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.360
Good day.

02:44.597 --> 02:46.531
Take a hike,
will you?.

02:46.599 --> 02:48.089
Jesus Christ!

02:48.168 --> 02:51.365
Why do they get
wasted on sour milk?.

02:51.437 --> 02:54.372
Why can't it be
Jack Saniel's orThunderbird?.

02:54.440 --> 02:55.998
What's wrong with that?.

02:56.075 --> 02:59.704
Look at this-
Fred Astaire and Ginger Slag.

02:59.779 --> 03:01.838
What the hell's that?.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.974
They call this
a game.

03:04.050 --> 03:07.508
It's a circlejerk.
Cowboys and slags.

03:07.587 --> 03:10.055
Ha ha ha!

03:10.123 --> 03:12.114
They make up shit.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.160
Beating each other
to death.

03:20.233 --> 03:22.724
So areyou going
or not?.

03:22.802 --> 03:24.667
How do I go?.

03:24.737 --> 03:27.171
You put on your
wash-and-wear suit,

03:27.240 --> 03:29.174
your clip-on bow tie,

03:29.242 --> 03:32.177
then you show up
at the church.

03:32.245 --> 03:33.678
It's simple.

03:33.746 --> 03:35.805
Me and Carol
are going.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.144
Well, that's nice.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.185
Hey, come on now.

03:39.252 --> 03:41.186
We've known
Kristin since...

03:41.254 --> 03:43.188
well, since she
was conceived.

03:43.256 --> 03:45.690
Ha ha ha haaa!

03:45.758 --> 03:47.885
Remember?.

03:47.961 --> 03:50.862
Up in that cabin
at Big Bear?.

03:50.930 --> 03:53.865
You and Edie were
pounding so damn hard,

03:53.933 --> 03:56.367
we had plaster
in our hair.

03:56.436 --> 03:58.870
Look, I-
obviously, I want to

03:58.938 --> 04:01.168
go to
Kristin's wedding.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.142
You just bummed
your ex-wife and her husband

04:04.210 --> 04:06.144
are paying for it.

04:06.212 --> 04:09.477
If Kristin got married
where I could afford it,

04:09.549 --> 04:11.744
we'd be in
a bowling alley.

04:23.962 --> 04:25.361
Soes that
look suspicious?.

04:25.430 --> 04:27.660
Whatever gaveyou
that idea?.

04:36.708 --> 04:39.677
We got a possible
211 in progress,

04:39.745 --> 04:42.680
Porter's Minimarket,
corner ofVirginia and Court.

04:42.748 --> 04:44.181
Requesting backup.

04:44.249 --> 04:47.275
Come on, forget that shit.
Let's go.

04:49.621 --> 04:51.680
Listen...
pay attention.

04:51.757 --> 04:54.692
You tell me what
those ugly bastards

04:54.760 --> 04:56.694
are doing in there.

04:56.762 --> 04:59.595
Two gentlemen,
long, black raincoats.

04:59.665 --> 05:01.496
Long, black raincoats.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.467
With long,
black shotguns.

05:03.535 --> 05:06.333
Oh, that's no good.

05:06.405 --> 05:09.932
It's not very good
at all.

05:10.008 --> 05:11.339
You gotyourvest?.

05:11.410 --> 05:14.470
Of course.
In the trunk ofthe car.

05:14.546 --> 05:17.276
I feel
a lot better now.

05:17.349 --> 05:18.816
Well, my brother,

05:18.884 --> 05:22.945
I'm going to get a better angle
on that door.

05:23.021 --> 05:24.420
You watch your ass.

05:24.489 --> 05:27.287
You watch my ass.

05:41.740 --> 05:42.672
Shit.

05:51.450 --> 05:52.644
Freeze!

05:52.718 --> 05:54.447
Hey, freeze!

06:01.894 --> 06:03.725
Aah!

06:18.210 --> 06:21.611
Tug! Come on,
get out ofthere!

06:21.680 --> 06:23.671
I can't!
Soyou mind?.

06:26.618 --> 06:29.746
Tug! Go ahead,
I'll coveryou!

06:29.821 --> 06:31.220
OK.

06:44.603 --> 06:46.161
Oh, shit!

07:01.253 --> 07:02.618
Hey,
what's happenin'?.

07:02.688 --> 07:04.622
Hi there.
How areyou?.

07:04.690 --> 07:06.624
You mind
stepping out here?.

07:06.692 --> 07:08.819
We got
a bit oftrouble.

07:48.834 --> 07:50.665
Tug.

07:50.736 --> 07:53.330
Oh... oh, shit.

10:16.281 --> 10:17.543
Aaaah!

10:35.767 --> 10:37.200
Yaah!
Ha ha!

10:42.274 --> 10:44.333
Ha ha!

10:47.779 --> 10:49.041
Aah!

10:52.184 --> 10:54.243
Aah!

11:15.941 --> 11:17.169
Oh!

11:17.242 --> 11:18.675
Whoa, whoa.

11:18.744 --> 11:21.178
Whoa, whoa!
Take it easy.

11:21.246 --> 11:22.679
You OK?.

11:22.748 --> 11:24.181
I'm all right.

11:24.249 --> 11:26.683
I better
call this in.

11:26.752 --> 11:28.185
Ow, my hand.

11:28.253 --> 11:29.686
Jesus.

11:31.590 --> 11:33.524
Areyou all right?.

11:33.592 --> 11:36.686
Oh... God, I hateyou.

11:38.263 --> 11:40.197
Get out ofhere!

11:40.265 --> 11:43.098
I don't need
your god damn help!

11:47.773 --> 11:49.707
Take it easy,
will you?.

12:07.192 --> 12:09.820
Except for the magazine,

12:09.895 --> 12:11.829
looks like
a standard 12 gauge.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.194
It is.

12:13.265 --> 12:16.166
How come it went
clean through the car?.

12:16.234 --> 12:18.361
B.R.I. Sabot slugs.

12:18.437 --> 12:21.304
Tug might as well have
been behind a rosebush.

12:21.373 --> 12:24.103
Pretty heavy stuff
for knocking off a minimarket.

12:24.176 --> 12:25.837
An identical round
was used

12:25.911 --> 12:27.936
in the shooting of
a newcomer named Hubely

12:28.013 --> 12:29.344
two days ago.

12:29.414 --> 12:30.438
How come-

12:30.515 --> 12:32.642
Francisco,
she won't budge.

12:32.717 --> 12:34.184
Hey, uh-
Hey, listen, uh...

12:34.252 --> 12:36.447
you think
there's a connection?.

12:36.521 --> 12:38.352
Hey!

12:40.091 --> 12:41.490
Up yours.

13:18.730 --> 13:20.163
Hello, Daddy?

13:20.232 --> 13:22.166
Dad, areyou there?

13:22.234 --> 13:24.668
Willyou pick up
the phone?

13:24.736 --> 13:27.364
I really need
to talk toyou.

13:27.439 --> 13:29.839
Why are you
being so stubborn?

13:29.908 --> 13:32.672
Can'tyou forget about
your hassles with Mom?

13:32.744 --> 13:34.006
It's my wedding.

13:34.079 --> 13:36.741
Come on,
you got to be there.

13:36.815 --> 13:39.682
Listen, I already
worked it out with Tug.

13:39.751 --> 13:42.686
Nothing will stop him
from dragging you

13:42.754 --> 13:44.688
to that church
on Sunday.

13:44.756 --> 13:47.691
It's at 2:30,
and please don't be late.

13:47.759 --> 13:49.522
I love you, Daddy.

13:49.594 --> 13:52.028
Ahh, I shouldn't
have said that.

13:52.097 --> 13:56.033
Nowyou'll pull this tape out
and save it, right?

13:56.101 --> 13:57.193
Bye.

13:58.703 --> 14:00.534
This is the gas company.

14:00.605 --> 14:03.130
Your bill
is past due, and-

14:31.403 --> 14:32.836
Yo, Matt.

14:32.904 --> 14:34.337
Matt.

14:34.406 --> 14:36.340
Oh, Matt.
I'm sorry, man.

14:36.408 --> 14:37.500
Matt.

14:37.576 --> 14:39.009
Yeah, thanks.

14:39.077 --> 14:41.011
I'm sorry
about that.

14:41.079 --> 14:43.013
What did you
dig up?.

14:43.081 --> 14:46.608
Jesus, Sykes, it hasn't even
been 10 hours yet.

14:46.685 --> 14:48.983
Me and Alterez
are on it.

14:49.054 --> 14:51.352
Yeah... that makes me
real happy.

14:51.423 --> 14:54.483
You ever try to make a case
in Slagtown?.

14:54.559 --> 14:56.527
The list
of Newcomer informants

14:56.595 --> 15:00.531
is as long as a list
of Mexican war heroes.

15:00.599 --> 15:02.032
Hey! Come on!

15:02.100 --> 15:04.694
Half of'em
don't even speak English.

15:04.769 --> 15:08.330
The other half...
onlywhen it suits 'em.

15:08.406 --> 15:10.271
It's gonna
take some time.

15:10.342 --> 15:14.472
I know it'll take time
with you two.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.480
I've got
an announcement.

15:16.548 --> 15:18.015
You OK, Sykes?.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.711
I'll make this short.

15:20.785 --> 15:23.447
This is a directive
from Chief Evener,

15:23.521 --> 15:25.489
acting on a mandate

15:25.557 --> 15:28.390
from the Federal Bureau
of Newcomer Relations.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.325
"As of 9:.00 this morning,

15:30.395 --> 15:32.329
one Newcomer
uniformed officer

15:32.397 --> 15:33.887
has been promoted
to detective. "

15:33.965 --> 15:35.660
And we've got him,
gentlemen.

15:35.734 --> 15:38.669
Volunteers for duty
with the new detective

15:38.737 --> 15:41.171
should see me
in my office.

15:41.239 --> 15:44.174
Otherwise, I will choose
a volunteer myself.

15:44.242 --> 15:46.642
That's all.

15:46.711 --> 15:48.872
What's he
going to do

15:48.947 --> 15:51.415
ifhe gets
too manyvolunteers?.

15:51.483 --> 15:54.350
How long's this slag
been on the force?.

15:54.419 --> 15:56.546
Ayear max, right?.

15:56.621 --> 16:00.352
I was in uniform eightyears
before I became detective.

16:00.425 --> 16:02.359
I'm calling
the union.

16:02.427 --> 16:04.725
You got it, babe.

16:04.796 --> 16:07.162
We'll backyou.

16:12.871 --> 16:15.066
No chance, man.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.835
Where the hell's
he going?.

16:16.908 --> 16:18.842
Bob?.

16:18.910 --> 16:20.002
Yeah, Sykes?.

16:20.078 --> 16:21.477
Yeah, I'd, uh...

16:21.546 --> 16:25.107
like to volunteer for duty
with the new, uh...

16:25.183 --> 16:26.650
um... you know.

16:26.718 --> 16:27.912
Uh... look, Matt...

16:27.986 --> 16:31.717
you don't have to
jump right back in.

16:31.790 --> 16:34.156
Why don'tyou
take a few days?.

16:34.225 --> 16:35.886
I'd like to stay on.

16:35.960 --> 16:37.484
All right.

16:37.562 --> 16:39.826
Setective Sergeant
Sykes,

16:39.898 --> 16:42.332
Setective Francisco.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.732
We have met.

16:44.803 --> 16:45.963
Yeah, right.

16:46.037 --> 16:47.436
Victor Goldrup,
Mayor's office.

16:47.505 --> 16:48.995
Congratulations,
gentlemen.

16:49.074 --> 16:51.372
You're to have
nothing to do

16:51.443 --> 16:53.240
with the investigation
into Tuggle's death.

16:53.311 --> 16:55.176
Leave that
to Federchuk.

16:55.246 --> 16:56.406
Right.

16:56.481 --> 16:57.882
You?.

16:58.015 --> 16:59.505
Yes, sir.

16:59.583 --> 17:02.518
There is a case
I'd like to take.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.611
A homicide.
A Newcomer named Hubely.

17:04.688 --> 17:07.623
Granger and Pitts
are already on it.

17:07.691 --> 17:09.625
They got
a full caseload.

17:09.693 --> 17:11.593
I thought,
what with, uh...

17:11.662 --> 17:13.459
excuse me,
Francisco here,

17:13.530 --> 17:14.963
first Newcomer plainclothes,

17:15.031 --> 17:17.626
with the body found
in the Newcomer community,

17:17.701 --> 17:18.998
I thought...

17:19.069 --> 17:21.127
Don't  tell me
what to think.

17:21.204 --> 17:24.902
It's exactlywhat we need for this
early advancement program.

17:24.974 --> 17:27.034
Yes, sir.

17:30.381 --> 17:32.747
All right,
all right.

17:32.816 --> 17:35.751
Good.

17:35.819 --> 17:37.810
We'll work my hours.

17:37.888 --> 17:41.324
I do the driving,
and you do the paperwork.

17:41.392 --> 17:44.327
Sergeant, I would
like to thankyou

17:44.395 --> 17:46.329
forwhatyou
are doing.

17:46.397 --> 17:47.830
Oh, wait... wait.

17:47.898 --> 17:50.833
Let me get something
straight in your head.

17:50.901 --> 17:52.835
Want cream
and sugar?.

17:52.903 --> 17:57.340
No, no, I want to get something
straight in your head.

17:57.408 --> 17:59.342
We are not pals,

17:59.410 --> 18:01.674
we're not taking
moonlightwalks together,

18:01.745 --> 18:03.610
and don't
call me Sergeant.

18:03.681 --> 18:05.615
Call me Sykes
or Matt.

18:05.683 --> 18:06.945
I am Samuel.

18:07.017 --> 18:08.951
Would you
like a doughnut?.

18:13.357 --> 18:14.790
Changeyour mind?.

18:16.860 --> 18:20.296
Sam Francisco?.

18:20.364 --> 18:21.797
Ha ha!

18:21.865 --> 18:23.799
No, I ain't
buyin' that.

18:23.867 --> 18:25.801
I'm not buying that.

18:25.869 --> 18:28.804
I'm not going to
introduceyou to people

18:28.872 --> 18:30.305
as Sam Francisco.

18:30.374 --> 18:32.808
I think
I'll call you... George.

18:32.876 --> 18:33.968
George?.

18:34.044 --> 18:36.808
OK.

18:38.882 --> 18:41.316
Oh, they hung one
on you.

18:41.385 --> 18:42.818
I, uh...

18:42.886 --> 18:45.821
I heard a lot
of good ones before,

18:45.889 --> 18:47.823
like Humphrey Bogart,
Harley Savidson.

18:47.891 --> 18:50.826
I guess the guys got
a little punchy

18:50.894 --> 18:53.829
handing out names
to a quarter million people.

18:53.897 --> 18:56.832
You weren't towards
the back ofthe line?.

18:56.900 --> 18:58.333
Oh, no.

18:58.402 --> 19:00.836
My true name is
Stangia Sorentzaah.

19:00.904 --> 19:02.337
Sorentzaah?.

19:02.406 --> 19:03.771
Thankyou.

19:03.841 --> 19:05.775
I'll call you George.

19:05.843 --> 19:07.777
Which paper
doyou like?.

19:07.845 --> 19:10.780
I find it difficult
to drive and read.

19:10.848 --> 19:12.281
Wait a minute.

19:12.349 --> 19:14.283
I gotyou
your cigarettes.

19:14.351 --> 19:16.285
Where did you
get this?.

19:16.353 --> 19:18.287
What is this stuff?.

19:18.355 --> 19:21.290
What is this?.
Tell me, what is this?.

19:21.358 --> 19:23.292
That is
a car deodorizer.

19:28.866 --> 19:30.299
That's mine.

19:30.367 --> 19:33.461
Anyway, what's it
botheryou

19:33.537 --> 19:35.471
ifwe think
your name's funny, right?.

19:35.539 --> 19:37.473
That is exactly so.

19:37.541 --> 19:39.475
It is like
your name... Sykes.

19:39.543 --> 19:42.478
To us it sounds
just like si ikes,

19:42.546 --> 19:44.480
two words
in my language

19:44.548 --> 19:47.278
which mean
excrement and cranium.

19:48.685 --> 19:50.016
Shithead.

19:55.025 --> 19:58.859
Why don'tyou go ahead?.
I'll be right in.

19:58.929 --> 20:00.362
Hey, man.

20:00.431 --> 20:02.797
Sowhat doyou
got for me?.

20:02.866 --> 20:06.825
You said you wanted
the biggest thing I could find,

20:06.904 --> 20:09.498
and this... is it.

20:11.075 --> 20:13.009
What in
the hell's this?.

20:13.077 --> 20:15.602
A.454 Casull.

20:15.679 --> 20:18.011
We're talking twice
the impact energy

20:18.082 --> 20:21.415
ofa. 44 Magnum hot load.

20:21.485 --> 20:23.316
Only holds five.

20:23.387 --> 20:26.845
Shells are too big
for six in a cylinder.

20:26.924 --> 20:29.358
Hell, Matt,
you only need one.

20:29.426 --> 20:31.519
No, two.

20:31.595 --> 20:33.187
Thanks.

20:42.139 --> 20:44.130
How long
you been shootin'?.

20:44.208 --> 20:47.177
That is
god damn pitiful!

20:47.244 --> 20:50.680
What will you do
in a shoot-out?.

20:50.747 --> 20:53.716
Wave the scores of
yourwritten exams?.

20:53.784 --> 20:55.718
Why'd you do it?.

20:55.786 --> 20:57.219
So what?.

20:57.287 --> 21:00.552
Agree to workwith me.
You don't like me.

21:00.624 --> 21:02.558
You have nothing
but contempt,

21:02.626 --> 21:04.184
yet you're my partner.

21:04.261 --> 21:06.161
My partner is dead

21:06.230 --> 21:09.165
because one of
you bastards killed him,

21:09.233 --> 21:11.701
then crawled down
some rat hole.

21:11.768 --> 21:13.929
You're going to
help me find

21:14.004 --> 21:17.940
that ugly slag son of a bitch,
you understand me?.

21:37.294 --> 21:39.524
That's awfully
pretty, huh?.

21:42.599 --> 21:44.032
Bring my gun.

21:54.745 --> 21:56.713
Let's talk
Hubely here.

22:00.117 --> 22:02.984
His bodywas discovered
three days ago

22:03.053 --> 22:05.487
in an alley
offCentral Avenue

22:05.556 --> 22:06.989
near downtown.

22:07.057 --> 22:09.491
With two slugs
in his chest.

22:09.560 --> 22:10.993
Through the chest,

22:11.061 --> 22:13.996
rupturing both the primary
and secondary hearts.

22:14.064 --> 22:17.158
Hey, nice signal,
dickhead!

22:17.234 --> 22:18.929
He was employed at

22:19.002 --> 22:20.993
the Consolidated
Petrochemical Refinery.

22:21.071 --> 22:24.006
He was manager
ofa methane facility.

22:24.074 --> 22:27.009
He was involved
in a real estate venture

22:27.077 --> 22:29.807
to develop low-cost housing
for Newcomers.

22:29.880 --> 22:31.347
Newcomers.
That's terrific.

22:31.415 --> 22:34.350
Real pillar
ofthe community.

22:34.418 --> 22:36.909
Was he ripped off?.

22:36.987 --> 22:38.614
Pardon me?.

22:38.689 --> 22:39.849
Um...

22:39.923 --> 22:42.619
was he missing anything
when they found him?.

22:42.693 --> 22:44.388
Oh, property.

22:44.461 --> 22:46.895
Five.

22:46.964 --> 22:48.864
He had no wallet

22:48.932 --> 22:51.059
but was wearing a watch
and two rings.

22:51.134 --> 22:54.035
Those guys last night
at the minimart,

22:54.104 --> 22:56.038
they made
a half-assed stab

22:56.106 --> 22:58.540
at the money
in the till.

22:58.609 --> 23:01.544
That's not what
theywere there for.

23:01.612 --> 23:04.376
We got a couple
executions on our hands.

23:04.448 --> 23:07.645
The murder at the minimart's
not our case.

23:07.718 --> 23:09.879
I don't want to
break procedure.

23:12.990 --> 23:14.548
What's wrong?.

23:14.625 --> 23:15.819
Wrong?.

23:15.892 --> 23:18.019
Nothing.
What should be wrong?.

23:18.095 --> 23:19.289
Nothing.

23:19.363 --> 23:20.990
What's wrong
with you?.

23:21.064 --> 23:22.292
Upyours!

23:22.366 --> 23:28.202
Um... you do agree that
there's a good chance

23:28.272 --> 23:30.604
that these two shootings
are related?.

23:30.674 --> 23:33.006
Yes, quite possibly.

23:33.076 --> 23:35.010
Would you also
be willing

23:35.078 --> 23:37.012
to accept
the theory, George,

23:37.080 --> 23:40.015
that by examining
the evidence of one case,

23:40.083 --> 23:43.280
we might shed a little light
on the other?.

23:43.353 --> 23:45.514
Soes that sound
unreasonable?.

23:45.589 --> 23:49.025
Yes... No, it is not
unreasonable.

23:49.092 --> 23:51.151
Although it is not-

23:51.228 --> 23:53.093
I'm so glad
that's settled.

23:53.163 --> 23:56.690
I thinkwe're really
starting to click, George.

23:56.767 --> 23:58.701
Give me
whatyou got.

23:58.769 --> 24:01.795
I've been over
all this this morning.

24:01.872 --> 24:06.002
You got nothing
better to do.

24:06.076 --> 24:08.601
Yeah, right.
Don't  push your luck.

24:08.679 --> 24:10.613
Anyway, according
to the sheet,

24:10.681 --> 24:13.616
the guyyou nailed
outside by the car-

24:13.684 --> 24:17.882
he was one Martin Helder-
white male, age 27.

24:17.954 --> 24:21.287
The rap sheet shows
one armed robbery conviction.

24:21.358 --> 24:25.294
The guywas on coke
when you stopped his clock.

24:25.362 --> 24:27.227
Haveyou identified
this one?.

24:27.297 --> 24:29.458
So far,
he's a John Soe...

24:29.533 --> 24:31.398
or a Sam Slag.

24:31.468 --> 24:34.460
There's no fingerprints,
so it could be tough.

24:34.538 --> 24:39.332
Lucky foryou, you got him
in both his hearts.

24:39.443 --> 24:42.503
I emptied
a whole clip into him.

24:42.579 --> 24:45.139
Usually that
just pisses them off.

24:45.582 --> 24:48.346
"It looks like the miner's disease. "

24:50.321 --> 24:52.186
Hey.

24:52.256 --> 24:53.985
What's going on?.

24:54.058 --> 24:55.082
Nothing.

24:55.159 --> 24:56.490
Nothing?.

24:56.894 --> 24:59.761
" Run blood tests and
keep it between us. "

24:59.863 --> 25:01.831
Got an extra
head shot.

25:01.899 --> 25:03.924
We're about
to start cutting.

25:04.001 --> 25:05.935
It's really
fascinating stuff.

25:06.003 --> 25:07.834
Yeah, I'll bet.

25:07.905 --> 25:09.839
Let's check
their personal effects.

25:17.514 --> 25:19.448
What is this?.

25:21.018 --> 25:23.953
What's that?.
It's a rubber.

25:24.021 --> 25:26.956
It's a, um...
you know, a condom.

25:27.024 --> 25:28.958
Coney Island
whitefish, you know.

25:30.327 --> 25:32.955
Um... men, you know,
human men...

25:33.030 --> 25:35.965
they put them
on their penises

25:36.033 --> 25:39.298
to protect from having babies,
understand?.

25:42.873 --> 25:45.671
Excuse me. You need
this for anything?.

25:45.743 --> 25:47.404
I got my own.

25:47.478 --> 25:49.469
She has her own.

25:52.049 --> 25:53.983
Here.

25:54.051 --> 25:55.177
See?.

25:55.252 --> 25:57.152
You get the picture?.

25:57.221 --> 25:59.314
And that fits?.

26:02.559 --> 26:04.424
Yeah, it's made
of rubber.

26:04.495 --> 26:06.258
It stretches,
right?.

26:06.330 --> 26:08.355
And still it fits?.

26:16.006 --> 26:18.440
What's
this stuffhere?.

26:18.509 --> 26:20.443
Oh, it's a resin.

26:20.511 --> 26:23.947
Newcomers working near methane gases
and oil refineries

26:24.014 --> 26:26.949
must paint it on
to protect against sparks.

26:27.017 --> 26:28.951
How doyou know that?.

26:29.019 --> 26:33.285
They hired my people because
methane fumes don't harm us.

26:33.357 --> 26:35.621
My spouse's
brother is one.

26:35.692 --> 26:37.626
All right.

26:37.694 --> 26:38.956
So, um...

26:39.029 --> 26:41.463
the slag they're
cutting into upstairs-

26:41.532 --> 26:43.466
he worked at a refinery,

26:43.534 --> 26:46.970
and Hubely-he worked
at a refinery.

26:47.037 --> 26:48.971
I guess that
possible connection

26:49.039 --> 26:52.475
is getting a hell
of a lot more possible,

26:52.543 --> 26:54.477
wouldn'tyou say
that, George?.

26:54.545 --> 26:58.379
I guess I should talk to
the store owner's wife.

26:58.449 --> 27:01.213
I should speak
to the widow alone.

27:02.986 --> 27:06.422
All right. You talk
to the widow alone.

27:06.490 --> 27:08.424
I'll check out
the refinery.

27:08.492 --> 27:10.426
Hey, uh, thanks, huh?.

27:15.032 --> 27:16.932
What about
this Hubely guy?.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.434
Hubelywas
a damn good manager.

27:19.503 --> 27:21.437
The men really
liked him.

27:21.505 --> 27:24.941
Apparently, one ofthem
didn't like him so much.

27:25.008 --> 27:26.942
Here. Give this a look.

27:27.010 --> 27:29.444
You think
this guy did it?.

27:29.513 --> 27:32.448
He could have been involved.
You know him?.

27:32.516 --> 27:36.714
I hate to admit it,
but they all look alike.

27:36.787 --> 27:38.448
Wait a minute.

27:38.522 --> 27:40.956
You know
who this looks like?.

27:41.024 --> 27:41.956
No.

27:42.025 --> 27:44.459
James Anderson.
He's not in today.

27:44.528 --> 27:46.462
He took
the afternoon off.

27:46.530 --> 27:48.464
I think
you'll find

27:48.532 --> 27:51.763
he took the rest
ofhis life off.

27:51.835 --> 27:53.632
Is this
where he worked?.

27:53.704 --> 27:55.467
Yeah,
right in there.

27:55.539 --> 27:59.305
Wait. There's 35%
pure methane gas in there.

27:59.376 --> 28:02.470
I don't know how
these fellas do it.

28:02.546 --> 28:03.740
Yeah.

28:03.814 --> 28:05.247
Thanks, huh?.

28:05.315 --> 28:07.249
Anything
I can do.

28:07.317 --> 28:08.909
Appreciate it.

28:44.555 --> 28:46.853
"I need your help, Mrs. Porter. "

28:47.324 --> 28:48.484
"I will try. "

28:51.895 --> 28:54.329
"Can you identify these Newcomers?"'

29:00.203 --> 29:02.364
" No, but my son might. "

29:14.885 --> 29:17.911
Here's on oldie but goodie
from 1988-

29:17.988 --> 29:20.422
the Four Tops
with I ndestructible.

29:40.544 --> 29:42.671
Welcome back,
Ozzie and Harriet.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.249
Well?.

29:52.322 --> 29:54.017
One second.

29:54.091 --> 29:55.888
We're not
even moving.

29:55.959 --> 29:57.392
Safety first.

29:57.461 --> 29:58.393
Bye!

29:58.462 --> 30:00.020
You have to yell?.

30:00.097 --> 30:01.997
Sorry.

30:02.065 --> 30:04.397
Sid you learn
anything?.

30:04.468 --> 30:06.265
Mrs. Porter
is not taking

30:06.336 --> 30:08.201
her husband's death
verywell.

30:08.271 --> 30:09.795
She identified
one man.

30:09.873 --> 30:11.602
It was
Warren Hubely.

30:11.675 --> 30:13.233
Well, all right.

30:13.310 --> 30:15.073
What about
the other guy?.

30:15.145 --> 30:19.081
She didn't know,
but she thought her son might.

30:19.149 --> 30:21.083
Sid you talk
to him?.

30:21.151 --> 30:25.747
No, but she told me
where I could find him.

30:25.822 --> 30:27.050
Good.

30:27.124 --> 30:29.524
Who's this guy
we got to go see?.

30:29.593 --> 30:33.359
William Harcourt-
a business associate of Hubely's.

30:40.671 --> 30:42.263
Our guest speaker
tonight

30:42.339 --> 30:45.001
has done so much
in his community.

30:45.075 --> 30:48.670
He's come quite far
in the last fewyears-

30:48.745 --> 30:51.509
granted, not as far
as he came

30:51.581 --> 30:54.209
in theyears
before reaching Los Angeles.

30:54.284 --> 30:56.343
- Ha ha ha!

30:56.420 --> 30:58.911
As Mayor ofthis city,

30:58.989 --> 31:02.059

to introduce

31:02.192 --> 31:04.956
someone who
has so readily made

31:05.028 --> 31:07.519
our city his home.

31:07.597 --> 31:11.055
Ladies and gentlemen,
William Harcourt.

31:46.203 --> 31:48.433
I am particularly
grateful...

31:48.505 --> 31:51.099
because I actually
had the gall

31:51.174 --> 31:53.438
to write in my notes-

31:53.510 --> 31:56.604
"Thankyou all
for a verywarm reception. "

31:56.680 --> 31:59.274
Imagine how embarrassed
I'd been

31:59.349 --> 32:02.284
ifit hadn't been
such a warm reception.

32:17.467 --> 32:18.832
Excuse me.

32:18.902 --> 32:20.563

Francisco. L.A.PD.

32:29.146 --> 32:31.273
Sergeant. Setective.

32:31.348 --> 32:34.784
I wasn't aware any Newcomers
were detectives yet.

32:34.851 --> 32:37.081
I am
the first, sir.

32:37.154 --> 32:38.348
Congratulations.

32:38.421 --> 32:41.185

32:41.258 --> 32:43.749

32:46.229 --> 32:48.254

32:49.766 --> 32:52.894
Ah. PoorWarren.
Tragic.

32:52.969 --> 32:54.766
Yeah, wasn't it?.

32:54.838 --> 32:57.102
I understand
you were partners

32:57.174 --> 33:01.110

real estate thing, huh?.

33:01.178 --> 33:04.113
He and I and seven
or eight others.

33:04.181 --> 33:05.205
William.

33:05.282 --> 33:09.616

Sykes
and Francisco.

33:17.627 --> 33:19.390
How do you do?.

33:19.462 --> 33:20.394

33:23.466 --> 33:26.333
Feel free to call my office

33:26.403 --> 33:29.395
Congratulations again

Thankyou.

33:31.141 --> 33:34.577
Remember, you're setting
an example in our community.

33:34.644 --> 33:37.841
I shall be keeping
an eye on you.

33:42.652 --> 33:46.019
He's going to keep
an eye on you.

33:46.957 --> 33:50.051
"Sykes was the one who chased us
and killed Anderson. "

33:51.127 --> 33:53.595
"You're lucky, he didn't
recognizeyou. "

33:54.965 --> 33:56.296
"What ifhe talks to Strader?"'

33:57.033 --> 34:01.402
" Mr. Strader's change ofheart
is dangerous, find him. "

34:03.707 --> 34:06.699
I've been going
to Berlitz foryears-

34:06.776 --> 34:08.072
6.42.

34:08.143 --> 34:09.543
Excuse me.

34:09.612 --> 34:10.705
Here.

34:10.780 --> 34:14.545
I got it.

34:14.618 --> 34:18.815
How long did it takeyou
to learn English?.

34:18.888 --> 34:20.150
Three months.

34:20.223 --> 34:21.382
Three months?.

34:21.458 --> 34:24.359
We learn quickly. We adapt.
It's our strength-

34:24.427 --> 34:26.327
what we were
bred for.

34:26.396 --> 34:29.058
My neighbor-
she's got this kid

34:29.132 --> 34:31.565
who's got a Newcomer
in the class.

34:31.635 --> 34:34.228
The kid's 6
and in the 7th grade.

34:34.304 --> 34:36.864
Imagine that.
Thanks a lot.

34:36.940 --> 34:39.431
To me, it's, like,
totally amazing.

34:39.509 --> 34:42.069
Yes, it is.

34:42.145 --> 34:44.079
Oh, my God.

34:44.147 --> 34:46.081
I gotyours.

34:46.149 --> 34:48.879
What is that?.
What kind is that?.

34:48.952 --> 34:49.884
This?.

34:49.953 --> 34:50.885
Yeah.

34:50.954 --> 34:51.886
Beaver.

34:51.955 --> 34:52.922
What?.

34:52.989 --> 34:54.684
Beaver.
It's tasty.

34:54.757 --> 34:55.690
Sure.

34:55.759 --> 34:56.748
Want some?.

34:56.826 --> 34:59.386
Not on a bet.

34:59.462 --> 35:02.693
I tell my son-
you don't know until you try.

35:02.766 --> 35:05.030
You tell him that?.

35:05.101 --> 35:07.035
Let me askyou
something-

35:07.103 --> 35:10.539
Would it really putyou out-
I mean, badly-

35:10.607 --> 35:13.542
ifyou put it
on the grill?.

35:13.610 --> 35:15.544
Our bodies don't
assimilate nutrients

35:15.612 --> 35:17.546
ifthe food's
been cooked.

35:17.614 --> 35:20.048
You know, George,
that's very attractive.

35:20.116 --> 35:22.550
We're going to
talk to people,

35:22.619 --> 35:26.055
and you got fur in your teeth-
very attractive.

35:26.122 --> 35:29.888
# Scarymonsters #

35:29.959 --> 35:31.756
# Super creeps #

35:31.828 --> 35:33.386
The store owner's widow

35:33.463 --> 35:35.829
thought we'd find
her son here.

35:35.899 --> 35:37.890
Just stay behind me.

35:37.967 --> 35:41.061
Just pay attention.
Let me handle it.

35:41.137 --> 35:42.729
Watch.

35:42.806 --> 35:44.068
Yo.

35:46.242 --> 35:49.473
# We've been running#

35:49.546 --> 35:53.073
# Runningscared#

35:56.286 --> 35:57.651
Yo!

35:57.721 --> 36:02.454
Which one ofyou slags
is Porter?.

36:02.525 --> 36:05.187
Yo. Who wants to know?.

36:05.261 --> 36:07.195
Who said that?.

36:07.263 --> 36:09.857
At the end
of the bar.

36:09.933 --> 36:11.025
Right.

36:15.605 --> 36:17.596
# She asked for my love #

36:17.674 --> 36:22.407
# And I gave her
a dangerous mind#

36:22.479 --> 36:24.037
# Nowshe's moving
in the street... # #

36:24.114 --> 36:26.776
You Porter?.

36:29.119 --> 36:30.814
Are you Porter?.

36:30.887 --> 36:33.378
No, Matthew.

36:34.991 --> 36:37.050
This is the one
you want.

36:44.134 --> 36:46.500
All right, huh?.

36:46.569 --> 36:47.593
Matthew.

36:47.670 --> 36:50.696
Hey, butt out.
I told you I'd handle it.

36:50.774 --> 36:52.036
But-

36:52.108 --> 36:53.302
Zip it.

36:54.377 --> 36:57.073
I'll start
with something easy,

36:57.147 --> 37:01.083
like is your name
Porter?.

37:08.558 --> 37:10.355
Screwyou.

37:10.427 --> 37:12.861
Yeah. Well, that
can't be right.

37:23.173 --> 37:24.640
You don't want
to know.

37:24.707 --> 37:26.334
Come on.

37:26.409 --> 37:29.139
Your mother mates
out ofseason.

37:35.552 --> 37:38.953
Ha ha ha!

37:39.022 --> 37:41.320
Ha ha ha ha!

37:41.391 --> 37:45.054
Don't  they teach you
anything about us

37:45.128 --> 37:48.291
in cop school,
little sloker?.

37:51.634 --> 37:53.727
Hey, George.
George!

37:56.773 --> 37:57.637
Enough.

37:59.642 --> 38:01.075
That's enough.

38:02.779 --> 38:05.805
"You smell like a human. "

38:06.583 --> 38:08.016
A cop.

38:09.586 --> 38:11.520
It fits you.

38:11.688 --> 38:14.885
"I'm sorry aboutyour father. "

38:15.558 --> 38:17.651
" Help us find his killers.
We can talk outside. "

38:24.434 --> 38:26.265
You know this guy?.

38:26.336 --> 38:28.827
When my people
first arrived here,

38:28.905 --> 38:31.373
he and I were
housed together.

38:31.441 --> 38:34.376
Your mother says
Hubely and your father

38:34.444 --> 38:36.708
were involved
with another Newcomer.

38:36.779 --> 38:38.804
You know
this other guy?.

38:38.882 --> 38:39.871
Yeah.

38:39.949 --> 38:41.041
Yeah?.

38:41.117 --> 38:43.051
High-roller dude
named Strader-

38:43.119 --> 38:44.711
Joshua Strader.

38:44.787 --> 38:47.722
He runs a club
on the west side.

38:47.790 --> 38:49.382
What club?.

38:49.459 --> 38:50.721
Encounters.

38:50.793 --> 38:52.522
I know that joint.

38:52.595 --> 38:54.586
Look, that's
all I know.

38:54.664 --> 38:57.599
You want any more,
you ask somebody else.

38:57.667 --> 38:59.396
Yeah, right.

38:59.469 --> 39:01.562
He's a pleasant guy.

39:04.073 --> 39:06.507
Ifl may make
a suggestion.

39:06.576 --> 39:08.009
Yeah, what?.

39:08.077 --> 39:11.012
We have different
weak spots than you do.

39:11.080 --> 39:14.015
Next time, a blow
to the nerve plexus

39:14.083 --> 39:18.019
under the arm here
will produce the effect

39:18.087 --> 39:20.521
I thinkyou were
looking for.

39:20.590 --> 39:22.353
I knew that.

39:23.593 --> 39:26.528
Lookwhat he did
to my flashlight.

39:26.596 --> 39:28.928
Look at this.
Come on.

39:54.123 --> 39:56.091
Any progress?.

39:56.159 --> 39:58.855
My arm's getting tired.
So far-zip.

40:02.332 --> 40:05.859
I understand you've been
resisting my offer.

40:05.935 --> 40:09.371
Mr. Strader, your sense
of duty is noble,

40:09.439 --> 40:14.706
but... no longer
an issue, I'm afraid.

40:14.777 --> 40:17.871
I will not make
this offer again.

40:17.947 --> 40:21.144
I would likeyou
to work for me,

40:21.217 --> 40:25.210
distributingJabluka
to our people.

40:25.288 --> 40:28.724
Ifyou do, you will know
wealth and comfort

40:28.791 --> 40:30.816
our people never
dared imagine.

40:32.562 --> 40:33.927
"I won't do it!"

40:33.997 --> 40:36.966
"I can't let the nightmare
start again. "

40:37.700 --> 40:40.726
Such a pity
to lose one's life

40:40.803 --> 40:42.737
for an outmoded
value.

40:44.307 --> 40:45.740
Mr. Quint...

40:45.808 --> 40:49.744
I believe it's time for
our friend's swimming lesson.

40:59.322 --> 41:02.086
It's important
to practice new skills-

41:02.158 --> 41:05.025
essential foryour growth
as a person.

41:05.094 --> 41:07.528
You ain't gonna
believe it, man.

41:07.597 --> 41:11.192
Sea water's like battery acid
to these guys.

41:17.407 --> 41:19.739
He won't talk
to those cops-

41:19.809 --> 41:23.301
the two who came to
question you about Hubely.

41:23.379 --> 41:25.813
This is getting
out ofhand.

41:25.882 --> 41:28.749
I wantyou to deal
with it... immediately.

41:34.657 --> 41:38.058
We must learn to embrace
the things we fear.

41:45.802 --> 41:48.737
# Please allow me
to introduce myself #

41:48.805 --> 41:54.607
# I'm a man
ofwealth and taste #

41:54.677 --> 41:58.238
# Been around
for long, long years #

41:58.314 --> 42:01.112
# Stole many a man
and sealed his fate #

42:02.218 --> 42:05.016
# I was around
when Jesus Christ #

42:05.088 --> 42:09.991
# Had his moment
of doubt and pain #

42:10.059 --> 42:13.153
# Made damn sure
that Pilate #

42:13.229 --> 42:16.665
# Washed his hands
and sealed his fate #

42:16.733 --> 42:19.065
Hey, darling!

42:19.135 --> 42:21.535
# I'm pleased to meetyou #

42:21.604 --> 42:25.665
# Hopeyou guess
my name #

42:25.742 --> 42:27.175
Whoa!

42:27.243 --> 42:29.803
# What's puzzling you
is the nature #

42:29.879 --> 42:31.676
# Ofmy game #

42:31.748 --> 42:33.978
Wanna bag a woman.

42:34.050 --> 42:36.177
Oh, come on!

42:36.252 --> 42:37.617
# Skipped around
St. Petersburg #

42:37.687 --> 42:40.679
I feel like
a beaver in heat.

42:40.757 --> 42:43.521
May I helpyou
with something?.

42:43.593 --> 42:46.824
# Killed the czar
and his ministers #

42:46.896 --> 42:51.765
# And the nation
screamed in pain #

42:51.834 --> 42:54.200
I'd like to speak
to Strader.

42:54.270 --> 42:56.204
That's his girl
up there.

42:56.272 --> 42:58.206
You better
ask her.

42:58.274 --> 43:00.208
You know
what I mean?.

43:00.276 --> 43:01.436
Thanks.

43:01.511 --> 43:04.139
# Pleased to meetyou #

43:04.213 --> 43:06.204
# Hopeyou guess
my name #

43:06.282 --> 43:08.147
George?.
Come to, George.

43:08.217 --> 43:09.650
You're drooling.

43:09.719 --> 43:15.919
# What's puzzling you
is the nature of my game # #

43:15.992 --> 43:17.789
Cassandra,
police department.

43:17.860 --> 43:19.794
This is sergeant
Matthew Sykes,

43:19.862 --> 43:21.295
and I'm-

43:21.364 --> 43:23.298
Shithead.
Ha ha ha!

43:23.366 --> 43:26.335
We're looking
foryour boss-Strader.

43:26.402 --> 43:28.802
He's not here.
Why ask me?.

43:28.871 --> 43:31.704
The hostess downstairs
said you might know.

43:31.774 --> 43:33.799
She did, did she?.

43:33.876 --> 43:35.309
She was wrong.

43:35.378 --> 43:37.608
Excuse me.
I have to change.

43:37.680 --> 43:40.478
That's good.
We have no problem here.

43:43.886 --> 43:46.787
Uh, we're not here
doing an interview

43:46.856 --> 43:49.381
for a high school
paper.

43:49.458 --> 43:51.323
This is a homicide
investigation.

43:51.394 --> 43:54.329
And, uh... ifyou don't stop
jerking around,

43:54.397 --> 43:56.297
we'll play
a little hardball.

43:56.365 --> 43:57.832
Oh... hardball.

43:57.900 --> 43:59.333
Sounds interesting.

43:59.402 --> 44:01.336
You going to strike me?.

44:01.404 --> 44:03.269
You could tie me up

44:03.339 --> 44:06.274
and then do
whateveryou wantwith me.

44:06.342 --> 44:08.173
I have my own ropes.

44:08.244 --> 44:12.271
Soes that come free,
oryou charge a little extra?.

44:12.348 --> 44:14.213
You have me all wrong.

44:14.283 --> 44:16.274
I never charge money

44:16.352 --> 44:19.283
for something
I myselffind pleasurable.

44:19.355 --> 44:22.290
I am going
out to the car.

44:22.358 --> 44:24.292
I will meetyou there.

44:26.529 --> 44:29.464
I don't know
where Mr. Strader could be.

44:29.532 --> 44:31.864
He comes, and he goes.

44:31.934 --> 44:34.801
Why don'tyou
hang around for a while

44:34.870 --> 44:36.804
and let me
entertain you?.

44:36.872 --> 44:38.305
Hmm... nice.

44:38.374 --> 44:39.807
It's Matt, right?.

44:39.875 --> 44:41.308
Yes, indeed.

44:41.377 --> 44:43.311
Tell me the truth.

44:43.379 --> 44:46.815
Haveyou ever
mated with one of us?.

44:46.882 --> 44:49.316
Uh... no, unless
I got drunk

44:49.385 --> 44:51.319
and somebody
didn't tell me.

44:51.387 --> 44:53.321
A virgin.

44:54.890 --> 44:57.825
Ahh... I find that
very arousing.

44:59.228 --> 45:01.162
You sureyou haven't?.

45:01.230 --> 45:02.822
Uh...

45:02.898 --> 45:05.765
there's lots ofthings
I haven't done.

45:05.834 --> 45:08.769
That's not real high
on my list.

45:08.837 --> 45:10.771
Don't  take it
personally.

45:10.839 --> 45:12.136
I'm a bigot.

45:12.207 --> 45:14.767
Maybeyou're just
a little afraid.

45:14.843 --> 45:16.276
Maybeyou're afraid

45:16.345 --> 45:19.872
ofwhat might happen
once the lights go out?.

45:19.949 --> 45:22.782
Maybe more
than you want to admit?.

45:22.851 --> 45:24.284
Soesn't that curiosity

45:24.353 --> 45:27.288
and that fear all swirling
together turn you on?.

45:27.356 --> 45:29.415
Think ofit as...

45:29.491 --> 45:32.051
broadening your horizons.

45:32.127 --> 45:33.116
Oh-

45:34.363 --> 45:35.796
Uh-

45:35.864 --> 45:38.458
I like my horizons
rather narrow.

45:39.868 --> 45:41.802
Yourvoice is saying no,

45:41.870 --> 45:43.804
butyour body's
saying yes.

45:43.872 --> 45:45.237
Yeah, well-

45:45.307 --> 45:46.638
Wait, whoa.

45:46.709 --> 45:48.301
Excuse me.

45:48.377 --> 45:51.312
Myvoice
and the rest of me

45:51.380 --> 45:54.816
are saying I'll be back
in a couple hours,

45:54.883 --> 45:57.818
and you make sure
that Strader's here.

45:57.886 --> 45:59.319
Huh?.

46:12.835 --> 46:15.770
George, you handle the women
from now on.

46:15.838 --> 46:17.772
What doyou mean?.

46:17.840 --> 46:20.070
I mean you handle
the women.

46:20.576 --> 46:22.339
"I know it's midnight. "

46:23.245 --> 46:25.145
"Yes I'm being careful. "

46:26.448 --> 46:28.541
"The human seems likable. "

46:29.385 --> 46:32.252
"We'll be working late tonight,
so don't wait up. "

46:37.359 --> 46:39.452
I loveyou, too.

46:41.864 --> 46:43.331
Soyou mind?.

46:43.399 --> 46:45.299
No. Be my guest.

47:00.282 --> 47:02.307
Ahh.

47:02.384 --> 47:04.477
That hits the spot.

47:04.553 --> 47:07.454
She keeps you
on a short leash, George.

47:07.523 --> 47:10.458
Mywife?.
She worries about me.

47:10.526 --> 47:13.256
I know
the routine.

47:20.269 --> 47:22.863
Your home
is quite disordered.

47:22.938 --> 47:27.272
I thought when I walked in
thatyou had been burglarized.

47:27.342 --> 47:30.800
Well, I appreciate
your honesty, George.

47:30.879 --> 47:32.278
Here.

47:34.349 --> 47:36.783
Ignore the bitch
on the left.

47:36.852 --> 47:39.787
That's Edie.
I call her Idi Amin.

47:39.855 --> 47:41.288
Heh heh.

47:41.356 --> 47:42.789
Uh...

47:42.858 --> 47:44.792
that's Kristin,
my daughter.

47:44.860 --> 47:47.795
Picture's a little old.
She's 20 now.

47:47.863 --> 47:50.297
Getting married,
matter offact, Sunday.

47:50.365 --> 47:52.799
Human children
can be very beautiful.

47:52.868 --> 47:54.802
Getting married.
Congratulations.

47:54.870 --> 47:57.202
You're taking
Sunday off, then?.

47:57.272 --> 47:58.796
Uh... no.

47:58.874 --> 48:00.808
I don't know.
Maybe not.

48:00.876 --> 48:03.743
I don't think
I'm going to go.

48:03.812 --> 48:07.009
She doesn't need
her burnt-out father there.

48:08.450 --> 48:10.418
I'll showyou
something.

48:14.323 --> 48:16.621
This is Susan,
mywife.

48:16.692 --> 48:18.250
Oh, yeah.

48:18.327 --> 48:21.660
I rememberwhen I
picked you up.

48:21.730 --> 48:23.254
Not bad.

48:23.332 --> 48:26.267
This is Richard,
my son, 4 years old.

48:26.335 --> 48:30.362
We named him afterthe former
President Richard Nixon.

48:30.439 --> 48:31.770
Ahem.

48:31.840 --> 48:32.807
You, uh-

48:32.875 --> 48:35.639
You open to a little
piece ofadvice?.

48:37.012 --> 48:38.946
Me, uh,
I'd tell people

48:39.014 --> 48:41.778
I named him after the actor
Richard Burton.

48:41.850 --> 48:43.784
Take myword
for it.

48:45.554 --> 48:47.283
So then
the doctor says,

48:47.356 --> 48:49.290
"Ifthis
is my thermometer,

48:49.358 --> 48:52.293
where is my pen?"'
Ha ha ha ha!

48:54.863 --> 48:57.798
You don't think
that's funny?.

48:59.868 --> 49:01.802
Look...

49:01.870 --> 49:04.737
the guy says,
"This, this is my-

49:04.807 --> 49:08.743
This is my-"
You got to workwith me, George.

49:08.811 --> 49:12.247
I get a laugh with this
all the time.

49:12.314 --> 49:15.750
Ifthe doctor has
the thermometer in his hand,

49:15.818 --> 49:17.752
where is his pen,
then?.

49:17.820 --> 49:19.754
In the other man's
rectum.

49:19.822 --> 49:22.256
Yeah! It's sticking
up his ass!

49:22.324 --> 49:23.757
Heh heh.

49:23.826 --> 49:25.259
Correct.

49:25.327 --> 49:27.761
Yeah, that's
what makes the joke.

49:27.830 --> 49:29.263
It's a surprise.

49:29.331 --> 49:32.266
Your mind fills in
these little funny pictures.

49:32.334 --> 49:36.771
See, there's a guy sitting
with a pen up his ass,

49:36.839 --> 49:38.272
and, uh...

49:39.842 --> 49:41.275
good luck, George.

49:43.345 --> 49:44.778
Tustack.

49:48.350 --> 49:50.784
I just think
that's really funny.

49:50.853 --> 49:52.286
Heh heh.

49:52.354 --> 49:54.288
Tell it to me
again.

49:54.356 --> 49:56.381
I got another one.

49:58.627 --> 50:01.824
# Sittin'on the dock
ofthe bay#

50:01.897 --> 50:03.797
# Wastin' time #

50:03.866 --> 50:05.800
There is so much

50:05.868 --> 50:09.304
our two peoples do not understand
about each other.

50:09.371 --> 50:10.804
No shit, Sherlock.

50:10.873 --> 50:13.307
You only come
from another planet!

50:13.375 --> 50:16.310
You humans are
very curious to us.

50:16.378 --> 50:18.812
You invite us
to live among you

50:18.881 --> 50:22.317
in an atmosphere of equality
that we've never known.

50:22.384 --> 50:25.319
You give us ownership
of our own lives,

50:25.387 --> 50:30.324
and you ask no more of us
than you do ofyourselves.

50:30.392 --> 50:34.385
I hopeyou understand
how uniqueyou humans are,

50:34.463 --> 50:37.830
which is why
it is all the more painful

50:37.900 --> 50:40.835
that so few ofyou
seem capable

50:40.903 --> 50:43.963
ofliving up
to the ideals you set.

50:44.039 --> 50:45.336
Don't  count me.

50:45.407 --> 50:48.342
I never had
any ideals.

50:48.410 --> 50:50.344
George,
you're all right.

50:50.412 --> 50:52.380
I am going home.

50:52.447 --> 50:54.847
# Looks like
nothin's gonna change#

50:54.917 --> 50:57.351
Yep. You go home.

50:57.419 --> 50:59.853
# Everything still remains
the same #

50:59.922 --> 51:01.355
Get some sleep.

51:01.423 --> 51:03.288
You better drive-

51:03.358 --> 51:05.292
too screwed up
to walk.

51:05.360 --> 51:07.294
# Tell me true #

51:09.197 --> 51:12.291
What a wild man.

51:12.367 --> 51:14.597
# Yeah#

51:14.670 --> 51:22.810
# Sittin'on the dock
ofthe b- #

52:30.645 --> 52:33.011
# Dock ofthe b- #

52:34.549 --> 52:36.642
Ohh!

52:36.718 --> 52:38.982
# Sittin'on the dock
ofthe b- #

52:39.053 --> 52:40.486
Yeah!

52:40.555 --> 52:42.079
# On the dock ofthe b- #

52:42.156 --> 52:44.488
# Sittin'on the dock
ofthe b- # #

52:44.559 --> 52:46.857
Better be good news
or money.

52:48.229 --> 52:49.958
Oh, George. What?.

52:50.031 --> 52:51.498
Hold this.

52:52.567 --> 52:54.501
I feel
very terrible.

52:56.070 --> 52:58.004
I'm so milked-over.

52:59.574 --> 53:01.508
Where'd you get this?.

53:01.576 --> 53:04.443
A man... a human...

53:04.512 --> 53:06.946
was wiring it
toyour car.

53:08.516 --> 53:10.677
My car?.

53:10.752 --> 53:13.186
She is going
to divorce me.

53:13.254 --> 53:16.951
She can't divorceyou.
You mate for life, right?.

53:17.025 --> 53:18.959
She is very
progressive.

53:19.027 --> 53:22.463
I am certain she is
considering it.

53:22.530 --> 53:23.963
Hey, Matt.

53:24.032 --> 53:27.468
Soes a guy named Strader
mean anything toyou?.

53:27.535 --> 53:28.968
Yeah. Why?.

53:29.037 --> 53:31.471
They found
what's left ofhim

53:31.539 --> 53:34.474
washed up
on the beach at Zuma.

53:34.542 --> 53:37.477
Federchuk and Alterez are
already on theirway.

53:37.545 --> 53:38.978
Thanks, Michelle.

53:39.047 --> 53:40.981
Come on, let's go.

53:43.551 --> 53:44.984
To the beach?.

53:45.053 --> 53:46.987
Yeah, surf's up.
Come on.

53:57.065 --> 53:59.499
Please, I must
get out here.

53:59.567 --> 54:02.058
Huh?. Why?.

54:02.136 --> 54:04.229
Stop the car!

54:04.305 --> 54:06.773
We won't go
near the water.

54:06.841 --> 54:09.366
I beg you,
stop this car.

54:09.444 --> 54:11.435
Please stop the car!

54:11.512 --> 54:13.571
OK. George!

54:13.648 --> 54:15.445
I'm stopping.

54:15.516 --> 54:16.949
OK. All right?.

54:17.018 --> 54:18.952
Go ahead, get out.

54:19.020 --> 54:22.251
It's cool.
I'll be back in a minute.

54:22.323 --> 54:23.881
Thankyou.

54:39.140 --> 54:41.165
That kid
reported this first?.

54:41.242 --> 54:42.971
Yeah, about 11:00.

54:43.044 --> 54:43.976
00?.

54:44.045 --> 54:44.977
Yeah.

54:47.048 --> 54:49.039
God damn.

54:49.117 --> 54:51.483
How doyou know
that's Strader?.

54:51.552 --> 54:54.988
We found his wallet
in his jacket pocket.

54:55.056 --> 54:57.183
Joshua Strader,
big as life.

54:57.258 --> 55:00.989
You got any idea
how long he's been dead?.

55:01.062 --> 55:03.929
Your guess is
as good as mine.

55:03.998 --> 55:07.593
Only thing holding
him together is his clothes.

55:11.506 --> 55:12.438
Hey.

55:12.507 --> 55:13.439
Huh?.

55:13.508 --> 55:15.942
Howyou doin'
on Tuggle's case?.

55:16.010 --> 55:18.444
Store owner's son's
in a street gang,

55:18.513 --> 55:21.448
so we're thinking
maybe it's gang-related.

55:21.516 --> 55:24.952
Good. Work on that
for a few months.

55:25.019 --> 55:27.453
Look atyour dildo
partner!

55:27.522 --> 55:29.387
He's scared
ofthe sand!

55:29.457 --> 55:34.019
I'd love to seeyou by a sea
ofhydrochloric acid.

55:39.333 --> 55:41.130
That's cute.

55:41.202 --> 55:42.726
Ha ha ha ha!

55:44.038 --> 55:46.165
That's real cute.

55:46.240 --> 55:48.470
I know why
he won't come.

55:48.543 --> 55:50.568
He forgot
his hip waders!

55:50.645 --> 55:52.806
Lay offhim,
you asshole.

55:52.880 --> 55:54.814
At least
I'm a detective,

55:54.882 --> 55:57.248
not some outer-shit
space thing.

56:03.991 --> 56:05.925
You know,
you're right.

56:05.993 --> 56:07.927
You are
a real detective,

56:07.995 --> 56:09.929
an honest-to-God
detective.

56:10.998 --> 56:13.330
Ah!

56:13.401 --> 56:15.699
Here, detect these!

56:18.940 --> 56:20.931
Ah!

56:27.014 --> 56:28.641
What was that about?.

56:28.716 --> 56:30.684
Nothing.

56:34.187 --> 56:37.452
You guys finish your postmortem
on Straderyet?.

56:37.524 --> 56:39.958
"The Blob"?.
They're finishing up now.

56:40.026 --> 56:41.459
Is Mr. Bentner here?.

56:41.528 --> 56:43.462
No. He went
home early.

56:43.530 --> 56:45.964
He left something
here foryou.

56:46.032 --> 56:47.124
Here.

56:47.200 --> 56:49.464
Soes this have
something to do

56:49.536 --> 56:51.470
with the tests
he ran?.

56:51.538 --> 56:52.971
What kind oftests?.

56:53.039 --> 56:54.472
A blood test

56:54.541 --> 56:58.136
on that alien you dropped
the other day.

56:58.211 --> 57:00.645
Los Angeles steals the ball!

57:00.714 --> 57:02.579
Sid he find anything?.

57:02.649 --> 57:03.741
Well, George?.

57:03.817 --> 57:05.580
...pass down the middle.

57:05.652 --> 57:07.051
It's nothing.

57:07.120 --> 57:10.578
...drives underneath
and makes a slam dunk!

57:10.657 --> 57:12.318
Hey!

57:12.392 --> 57:14.758
Don't  give me
that nothing shit!

57:14.828 --> 57:16.420
It wasn't nothing
yesterday

57:16.496 --> 57:19.761
when you asked what's-his-name
to run that test,

57:19.833 --> 57:23.769
and he looked like he was
about to shit peach pits!

57:23.837 --> 57:26.772
It's not nothing now!
Don't  lie to me!

57:26.840 --> 57:28.774
You must
leave me alone.

57:28.842 --> 57:31.777
No. I'm sorry.
I don't leaveyou alone.

57:31.845 --> 57:34.712
You're my partner.
I don't work that way.

57:34.781 --> 57:36.214
Huh?. All right?.

57:36.282 --> 57:37.374
Well?.

57:38.618 --> 57:39.880
OK.

57:41.187 --> 57:43.121
No secrets,
god damn it.

57:43.189 --> 57:46.386
That slag up there,
he was on something.

57:46.459 --> 57:49.951
It wasn't sour milk.
Am I right, George?.

57:50.030 --> 57:51.725
Tell me-
Aah, shit!

57:51.798 --> 57:53.231
Tell me now!

57:53.299 --> 57:54.561
Now!

57:56.302 --> 57:58.736
The drug is called
Jabluka.

58:00.640 --> 58:02.835
It is a potent narcotic.

58:02.909 --> 58:04.308
How potent?.

58:04.377 --> 58:06.572
More potent
than any human drug

58:06.646 --> 58:08.136
you can imagine.

58:08.214 --> 58:09.738
The controllers
regulated it.

58:09.816 --> 58:12.751
We would receive
small amounts as a reward

58:12.819 --> 58:15.253
for our labor
in the mines.

58:15.321 --> 58:17.619
You were
on this shit?.

58:17.691 --> 58:19.249
Yes! We all were.

58:19.325 --> 58:22.590
Wewere genetically engineered
as slave laborers.

58:22.662 --> 58:25.756
Itwas our only means
ofpleasure allowed!

58:25.832 --> 58:28.767
The harderyou worked,
the moreyou got.

58:28.835 --> 58:32.271
The moreyou got,
the harderyou worked.

58:32.338 --> 58:34.704
Thousands of my people...

58:34.774 --> 58:36.105
died.

58:36.176 --> 58:38.701
I lost
my best friend.

58:38.778 --> 58:40.541
It is a nightmare.

58:42.782 --> 58:46.149
I will not
let it happen again.

58:46.219 --> 58:51.122
Wh-Whywouldn'tyou just
tell me something like that?.

58:51.191 --> 58:54.558
Your people cannot know about
this part of our past.

58:54.627 --> 58:57.118
Itwould threaten our
entire existence here.

58:57.197 --> 58:59.563
How did
this guy get it?.

58:59.632 --> 59:02.157
I don't know
how he got it.

59:02.235 --> 59:04.169
Was it on the ship?.

59:06.806 --> 59:08.330
No.

59:09.809 --> 59:11.743
I mean this is, uh...

59:11.811 --> 59:13.745
it's major, George.

59:13.813 --> 59:15.747
It's really major.

59:15.815 --> 59:20.411
It's simple. All you
had to do was tell me.

59:20.487 --> 59:21.749
Here's Hubely.

59:21.821 --> 59:24.085
Looks like
he passed up jobs,

59:24.157 --> 59:27.957
waiting for the one
at the refinery.

59:28.027 --> 59:31.588
Would you punch up
Joshua Strader for me?.

59:34.267 --> 59:36.030
Released on November 29th.

59:36.102 --> 59:37.694
Came immediately to L.A.

59:37.771 --> 59:41.366
And took over a club
called the Encounters.

59:41.441 --> 59:44.035
Now the store owner, please.
Cecil Porter.

59:44.110 --> 59:45.702
Released Secember 1.

59:45.779 --> 59:48.339
Field of
expertise...

59:48.414 --> 59:50.211
organic
chemical engineering.

59:50.283 --> 59:51.716
Holy shit!

59:51.785 --> 59:53.719
What we're
looking at here...

59:53.787 --> 59:56.881
you got three Newcomers
with nothing in common.

59:56.956 --> 59:59.481
What ifit's
just one guy

59:59.559 --> 01:00:01.720
that shot
the three ofthem?.

01:00:01.795 --> 01:00:03.729
Nowyou got
four Newcomers,

01:00:03.797 --> 01:00:05.560
totally different
backgrounds...

01:00:05.632 --> 01:00:06.860
George.

01:00:08.301 --> 01:00:10.030
Quarantine.

01:00:10.103 --> 01:00:11.730
Honey, uh...

01:00:11.805 --> 01:00:13.739
punch up
the occupants

01:00:13.807 --> 01:00:16.241
of Porter's
lodge number.

01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:18.573
OK. Porterwas in 772.

01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:24.517
Harcourt.

01:00:25.819 --> 01:00:27.081
Gin.

01:00:27.153 --> 01:00:29.621
Porter somehow
created the formula.

01:00:29.689 --> 01:00:32.783
Hubely provided the manufacturing
at the refinery.

01:00:32.859 --> 01:00:36.192
Strader's nightclub was
the distribution network.

01:00:36.262 --> 01:00:38.196
Harcourt
wiped them all out

01:00:38.264 --> 01:00:41.427
so he could have
all the marbles.

01:00:41.501 --> 01:00:43.196
He's responsible
for everything.

01:00:43.269 --> 01:00:46.602
I want his ass.
He's mine.

01:00:46.673 --> 01:00:48.698
We got to play
this smart.

01:00:48.775 --> 01:00:51.710
The drug is here.
We must destroy it.

01:00:51.778 --> 01:00:54.212
Hold it.
You're missing the point.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:57.374
The drug is our evidence.
We need it.

01:00:57.450 --> 01:01:00.613
Hey! That's
the guy right there.

01:01:05.358 --> 01:01:07.155
Areyou crazy?.

01:01:07.227 --> 01:01:08.888
Open the door!

01:01:08.962 --> 01:01:12.329
So much for
playing it smart.

01:01:12.398 --> 01:01:14.889
You can't come
in here like this!

01:01:14.968 --> 01:01:16.492
Shut up!

01:02:18.298 --> 01:02:20.323
Where's the drug?.

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:23.961
What drug?. This is
an oil refinery!

01:02:24.037 --> 01:02:25.095
Aagggh!

01:02:26.306 --> 01:02:27.466
Where?.

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:29.633
You can't do this!
Aagggh!

01:02:29.709 --> 01:02:32.769
I thinkyou're crushing
his little chest bones.

01:02:32.845 --> 01:02:34.574
Stay out ofthis.

01:02:34.647 --> 01:02:35.773
Right.

01:02:35.848 --> 01:02:38.681
Tell mewhere
the drug has been taken,

01:02:38.751 --> 01:02:41.015
or I'll crush
your lungs.

01:02:41.087 --> 01:02:42.611
Hey, O'Neal,

01:02:42.689 --> 01:02:44.782
don't piss him off.

01:02:44.857 --> 01:02:46.984
I can't control him.

01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:49.824
I saw him once
pull out a guy's spine

01:02:49.896 --> 01:02:51.830
and show it to him.

01:02:51.898 --> 01:02:54.696
I had to throw up,
you know.

01:02:56.269 --> 01:02:59.204
They took the stuff out
this afternoon...

01:02:59.272 --> 01:03:00.830
all ofit.

01:03:00.907 --> 01:03:03.201
Where did
they take it?.

01:03:03.276 --> 01:03:05.471
Aah! The Encounters club.

01:03:46.753 --> 01:03:48.345
Quite lovely.

01:03:49.756 --> 01:03:52.190
What is
your name again?.

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.193
Cassandra.

01:03:56.263 --> 01:03:58.197
I shall remember that.

01:04:00.333 --> 01:04:01.698
George, lighten up.

01:04:01.768 --> 01:04:05.704
Don't  sweat it.
We got them by the short hairs.

01:04:05.772 --> 01:04:09.299
He ain't gonna make
any more ofthat shit!

01:04:09.376 --> 01:04:12.709
Ifyou destroy the drugs,
you'll destroy the case.

01:04:12.779 --> 01:04:14.747
Please stick
to procedure, OK?.

01:04:14.814 --> 01:04:16.714
Fuck procedure.

01:04:18.351 --> 01:04:19.716
Hey, George-

01:04:19.786 --> 01:04:21.048
George!

01:04:21.121 --> 01:04:22.952
God damn it!

01:04:23.023 --> 01:04:25.218
# George Francisco #

01:04:25.292 --> 01:04:27.226
# Open your Golden Gate #

01:04:27.294 --> 01:04:29.728
# Open your gate
and let me in # #

01:04:38.738 --> 01:04:40.171
You! Hey, you!

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.174
Police!
Get out ofthere.

01:04:42.242 --> 01:04:43.334
What?.

01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:45.344
Walk that line
right now!

01:04:45.412 --> 01:04:46.845
Come on!

01:04:46.913 --> 01:04:48.847
What areyou
talking about?.

01:04:49.916 --> 01:04:51.349
What about me?.

01:04:51.418 --> 01:04:53.784
Senor,
that's my truck!

01:04:58.858 --> 01:05:02.055
It's been a long time...

01:05:02.128 --> 01:05:03.789
hasn't it, gentlemen?.

01:05:03.863 --> 01:05:06.093
What is it?.

01:05:06.166 --> 01:05:08.691
A sweet indulgence
from our past,

01:05:08.768 --> 01:05:11.168
resurrected
for our future.

01:05:11.238 --> 01:05:14.036
Feel free
to sample the quality.

01:05:14.107 --> 01:05:16.541
I'm sure
the experience will be

01:05:16.610 --> 01:05:18.874
everything
you remember it to be.

01:05:22.115 --> 01:05:24.049
Where did
you get it?.

01:05:24.117 --> 01:05:27.052
I spent time with three
very resourceful men.

01:05:29.956 --> 01:05:31.787
Mmm!

01:05:35.895 --> 01:05:38.386
Jesus, it tastes
like detergent.

01:05:38.465 --> 01:05:40.763
That's all the effect
you'll get.

01:05:40.834 --> 01:05:44.827
But when my fellow Newcomers
learn they can obtain it here,

01:05:44.904 --> 01:05:46.838
theywill workvery hard

01:05:46.906 --> 01:05:51.400
to make as much money
as they can to give it to me.

01:05:51.478 --> 01:05:54.208
Tell them the rest,
Harcourt!

01:05:54.281 --> 01:05:55.771
Tell them!

01:05:55.849 --> 01:05:58.613
He's got
the C-4 charge.

01:05:58.685 --> 01:06:00.880
Putyour guns
on the table.

01:06:00.954 --> 01:06:03.286
Up against the wall
exceptyou!

01:06:03.356 --> 01:06:04.550
Take it easy,
buddy.

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:09.788
Keepyour finger
on the button.

01:06:09.863 --> 01:06:11.353
You release that button,

01:06:11.431 --> 01:06:14.525
you'll not only kill us
butyourself.

01:06:14.601 --> 01:06:17.866
To getyou and this,
I would do it.

01:06:17.937 --> 01:06:22.306
That is not in any books
as a controlled substance-

01:06:22.375 --> 01:06:25.970
legally, no different than
12 kilos of grape jelly.

01:06:26.046 --> 01:06:27.877
The charge is murder

01:06:27.947 --> 01:06:30.381
and conspiracy
to commit murder.

01:06:30.450 --> 01:06:31.883
Hubely...

01:06:31.951 --> 01:06:33.384
Porter...

01:06:33.453 --> 01:06:35.387
Strader.

01:06:35.455 --> 01:06:36.820
You killed Strader!

01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:39.790
No!

01:06:39.859 --> 01:06:40.587
Aah!

01:06:44.831 --> 01:06:46.526
Kill them both!

01:06:46.599 --> 01:06:47.657
Here?.

01:06:47.734 --> 01:06:49.759
So it!

01:06:58.745 --> 01:06:59.905
Don't  shoot!

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:15.955
4230 Hollywood Boulevard,

01:07:16.029 --> 01:07:17.929
Club Encounters.

01:07:17.997 --> 01:07:19.692
Yes.

01:07:48.628 --> 01:07:49.890
Shit, it worked.

01:07:51.464 --> 01:07:54.632
Turn back!

01:07:54.701 --> 01:07:56.566
Get the car!
Let's go!

01:07:56.636 --> 01:07:58.797
I can't!
You have the keys!

01:08:09.983 --> 01:08:12.417
Turn the police light on.

01:08:40.546 --> 01:08:42.037
Pull it over!

01:08:42.115 --> 01:08:44.345
Don't  put that
in my face!

01:08:47.153 --> 01:08:48.711
Man, get out-

01:09:03.069 --> 01:09:04.229
We lost them.

01:09:47.879 --> 01:09:49.710
Move! Everybody move!

01:09:49.781 --> 01:09:52.875
Move, will you?.
We're the god damn police!

01:10:17.208 --> 01:10:18.334
On your right.

01:10:41.933 --> 01:10:44.561
The god damned road
is blocked!

01:10:50.542 --> 01:10:51.941
Oh, Christ.

01:10:54.012 --> 01:10:56.742
Head straight for them.
He'll move.

01:10:56.815 --> 01:10:59.283
This is chickie, George.
I never lose.

01:11:03.888 --> 01:11:04.547
Samn!

01:11:25.210 --> 01:11:26.404
Uhh!

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.414
Ohh!

01:11:47.766 --> 01:11:48.858
George.

01:11:50.935 --> 01:11:52.869
Anything broken?.

01:11:52.937 --> 01:11:54.962
You all right?.

01:11:58.943 --> 01:12:00.535
Don't  move.

01:12:54.933 --> 01:12:56.764
Put 'em up.

01:12:59.204 --> 01:13:01.536
I said
put them up.

01:13:10.648 --> 01:13:12.582
Hey... you move
one finger,

01:13:12.650 --> 01:13:14.174
and you're history.

01:13:14.252 --> 01:13:15.879
Not history!

01:13:15.954 --> 01:13:17.046
Eternity!

01:13:59.430 --> 01:14:00.624
Aagggh!

01:14:31.462 --> 01:14:33.327
I just remembered
a joke

01:14:33.398 --> 01:14:35.332
that my son told me.

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:36.833
Yeah?.

01:14:39.404 --> 01:14:40.336
So?.

01:14:40.405 --> 01:14:43.841
I- I-I better not
tell it now.

01:14:43.908 --> 01:14:46.342
I'd-I'd-I'd-
I never-

01:14:46.411 --> 01:14:48.345
I don't
tell jokes well.

01:14:48.413 --> 01:14:51.348
No, probably not,
but go ahead, tell me.

01:14:52.917 --> 01:14:56.353
If I-if I-
ifl begin to tell it

01:14:56.421 --> 01:14:59.356
and you know the joke,
please say that.

01:14:59.424 --> 01:15:02.359
Why did the chicken
cross the road?.

01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:08.364
I know it.

01:15:09.934 --> 01:15:12.368
It's-It's
a funnyjoke.

01:15:16.941 --> 01:15:19.876
I assume with Harcourt
and Kipling dead,

01:15:19.944 --> 01:15:22.879
you will be requesting
a reassignment now.

01:15:22.947 --> 01:15:23.879
Well...

01:15:25.450 --> 01:15:27.384
just for
your own good.

01:15:27.452 --> 01:15:29.386
I think
you'd be better

01:15:29.454 --> 01:15:33.322
with a partnerwho's,
you know, more by the book.

01:15:35.393 --> 01:15:38.328
But still, George,
I got to tell you,

01:15:38.396 --> 01:15:43.333
for a quiet guy, once you get started,
you're hell on wheels.

01:15:43.401 --> 01:15:46.837
I hate missing your next few days
as detective.

01:15:46.905 --> 01:15:49.465
Guys, I'll take you
to the station.

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:50.837
Come on, partner.

01:15:50.909 --> 01:15:53.343
They're waiting
to take your statement

01:15:53.411 --> 01:15:54.844
on the shooting.

01:15:54.913 --> 01:15:56.847
I didn't shoot.
He OS'd.

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:03.953
You got a match?.

01:16:04.022 --> 01:16:05.512
Yeah, in there.

01:16:08.826 --> 01:16:10.350
Aah!

01:16:11.930 --> 01:16:13.864
What's this about,
Sarge?.

01:16:13.932 --> 01:16:15.866
Just keep driving,
all right?.

01:16:15.934 --> 01:16:17.367
Just drive.

01:16:24.442 --> 01:16:26.376
What the heck
is that?.

01:16:29.948 --> 01:16:31.313
Holy...

01:16:31.382 --> 01:16:33.373
I'm calling
for backup.

01:16:33.451 --> 01:16:34.383
No.

01:16:37.455 --> 01:16:39.389
Leave it be,
will you?.

01:17:04.482 --> 01:17:05.915
Sarge.

01:17:09.988 --> 01:17:11.421
Something
gutted them.

01:17:14.993 --> 01:17:18.429
I'm going to request help
and an air unit.

01:17:23.001 --> 01:17:25.435
What-What-
What is this?.

01:17:25.503 --> 01:17:26.936
It's Harcourt.

01:17:27.005 --> 01:17:28.438
He's dead.

01:17:28.506 --> 01:17:29.803
No, he's not-

01:17:29.874 --> 01:17:32.809
not ifhe overdosed
on the drug.

01:17:32.877 --> 01:17:34.868
Massive amounts
trigger a change.

01:17:34.946 --> 01:17:36.379
You appear dead,

01:17:36.447 --> 01:17:39.382
but it's a state
ofincubation.

01:17:39.450 --> 01:17:40.849
When you emerge,

01:17:40.918 --> 01:17:43.478
you are
metamorphasized.

01:17:43.554 --> 01:17:46.489
We must not
let him get away.

01:17:46.557 --> 01:17:47.489
What?.

01:17:47.558 --> 01:17:48.991
What would happen

01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:53.394
ifhumans see what we
are capable ofbecoming?.

01:18:26.130 --> 01:18:27.597
Got him!

01:18:29.033 --> 01:18:30.591
Wiltey, no!

01:20:24.815 --> 01:20:25.782
Argh!

01:20:35.593 --> 01:20:36.617
Aah!

01:21:10.962 --> 01:21:12.122
Ah!

01:21:33.451 --> 01:21:36.181
Hey, you!
Get the hell off my boat.

01:21:37.455 --> 01:21:40.356
You heard me.
Get offthe boat!

01:21:40.424 --> 01:21:41.584
Over there!

01:21:51.669 --> 01:21:53.296
Argh!

01:21:55.773 --> 01:21:58.867
Nice view, huh,
you dumb sack of shit!

01:22:01.245 --> 01:22:03.770
Let's have a cold one!

01:22:03.848 --> 01:22:05.372
Aah!

01:22:07.951 --> 01:22:09.475
Take her down!

01:22:15.959 --> 01:22:18.450
Sown! Take it down!

01:22:21.965 --> 01:22:23.398
Aah!

01:22:29.173 --> 01:22:31.573
Aah!

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:46.614
Your scarf!.
Can I  borrow your  scarf?.

01:22:52.196 --> 01:22:53.629
Take her down!

01:23:04.808 --> 01:23:06.571
Aargh!

01:23:15.919 --> 01:23:17.853
Aah!

01:23:19.556 --> 01:23:20.853
Aah!

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:25.260
Aah!

01:23:56.226 --> 01:23:58.660
Aah!

01:24:00.397 --> 01:24:03.389
Aah!

01:24:04.935 --> 01:24:08.496
Aah!

01:24:34.765 --> 01:24:35.993
Uh!

01:24:39.069 --> 01:24:41.503
Wait... wait... wait.

01:24:44.675 --> 01:24:46.734
What the hell was that?.

01:24:46.810 --> 01:24:48.675
It looked reallyweird!

01:24:48.745 --> 01:24:50.679
What doyou mean weird?.

01:24:50.747 --> 01:24:52.681
Looked like
every other slag,

01:24:52.749 --> 01:24:54.182
just plain ugly.

01:24:54.251 --> 01:24:56.185
Hey, look at this!

01:25:10.434 --> 01:25:11.696
Go ahead. Wait.

01:25:11.768 --> 01:25:13.702
Let me hold the tie.

01:25:13.770 --> 01:25:14.702
Ah!

01:25:14.771 --> 01:25:15.703
Sorry.

01:25:15.772 --> 01:25:17.205
Everybody gets dressed,

01:25:17.274 --> 01:25:19.708
right before their
daughter gets married.

01:25:19.776 --> 01:25:21.209
Thereyou go.

01:25:21.278 --> 01:25:24.076
It looks all right?.

01:25:24.147 --> 01:25:25.079
Good.

01:25:25.148 --> 01:25:26.308
Ready, Saddy?.

01:25:29.119 --> 01:25:30.586
All set?.

01:25:30.654 --> 01:25:32.053
Yes, honey.

01:25:33.056 --> 01:25:37.993
Uh, George, uh,
I just want to...

01:25:38.061 --> 01:25:40.825
I'm going to apologize
for the rotten things

01:25:40.897 --> 01:25:45.163
I'm going to do and say
toyou over theyears.

01:25:45.235 --> 01:25:47.169
It's all right,
Matthew.

01:25:47.237 --> 01:25:49.501
After all,
you're only human.

01:25:51.074 --> 01:25:53.008
What a wild man.

01:25:55.612 --> 01:25:58.012
Mydaughter's got a husband,
I got a partner.

01:25:58.081 --> 01:26:00.015
He ain't reallyhalfbad,

01:26:00.083 --> 01:26:04.019
except when he's got
that rotten milk on his breath.

01:26:04.087 --> 01:26:06.014
# We are friends #

01:26:06.089 --> 01:26:08.216
# We are brothers #

01:26:08.291 --> 01:26:12.660
# Always there
looking out for each other #

01:26:12.729 --> 01:26:16.165
# I n a world
where so many dreams #

01:26:16.233 --> 01:26:19.100
# Are broken apart #

01:26:19.169 --> 01:26:21.797
# Yeah, but #

01:26:21.872 --> 01:26:26.104
# When the world
tries to beat us #

01:26:26.176 --> 01:26:27.336
# We hang tough #

01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:30.277
# Ain't no way
they'll defeat us #

01:26:30.347 --> 01:26:34.545
# 'Causeyou and I
will always survive #

01:26:34.618 --> 01:26:37.781
# Togetherwe're strong #

01:26:37.854 --> 01:26:39.879

# Any storm we can weather #

01:26:42.459 --> 01:26:44.086
# You and I #

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:48.688
# We've become united
forever #

01:26:48.765 --> 01:26:51.598
# Two hearts
that can beat as one #

01:26:51.668 --> 01:26:56.071
# There ain't a single thing
we can't overcome #

01:26:56.139 --> 01:26:58.607
# We're indestructible #

01:26:58.675 --> 01:27:00.768
# Indestructible #

01:27:00.844 --> 01:27:03.779
# We got the power oflove #

01:27:06.516 --> 01:27:09.542
# So strong
We can generate #

01:27:09.619 --> 01:27:13.988
# A wall ofsolid love
