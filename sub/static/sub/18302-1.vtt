02:38.083 --> 02:39.458
Give me more!

02:40.501 --> 02:42.710
Come on, honey, get it all off!

04:41.000 --> 04:43.417
Come on, let me stand up
for queen and country.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.058
Come on, show us what you got!

04:47.034 --> 04:49.057
Come on, honey, all of it!

04:49.325 --> 04:51.034
There you go, all of it!

04:55.982 --> 04:57.232
And the dress!

05:00.300 --> 05:01.675
Come on, babe!

05:11.876 --> 05:14.876
If one more person calls me "babe"...

05:23.918 --> 05:27.001
Mr. Santos, your package has arrived.

05:27.759 --> 05:30.427
- My special order?
- Under lock and key.

05:30.553 --> 05:32.930
- What about the new dancer?
- Who?

05:33.082 --> 05:35.791
The blonde with the guns.

05:36.935 --> 05:38.852
If she's more to your pleasing,

05:38.978 --> 05:43.023
it's her first night, and I
haven't had a chance to feel her out.

05:43.691 --> 05:46.068
But you'll be very pleased
with the special order.

05:46.402 --> 05:48.570
She's as tender as Tuscan veal.

06:00.458 --> 06:02.709
How's the crowd, honey?

06:04.921 --> 06:06.672
Wet!

06:09.384 --> 06:11.802
- Come again?
- She's Chinese.

06:21.479 --> 06:23.272
Very well done.

06:23.773 --> 06:25.399
They loved you.

06:25.733 --> 06:29.111
I'd like to talk to you...
about coming back.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.613
In my office.

06:31.781 --> 06:34.199
I'll be waiting for you.

06:34.409 --> 06:36.118
Sure thing, big boy.

07:10.445 --> 07:12.863
What are you doing here?

07:13.197 --> 07:15.032
Looking for a light.

07:20.163 --> 07:21.204
Got one?

07:23.124 --> 07:24.958
I don't smoke.

07:30.506 --> 07:32.341
Neither do I.

07:43.186 --> 07:44.478
Who are you?

07:44.854 --> 07:46.855
I'm the one who's getting you
out of here. Trust me.

07:47.649 --> 07:50.484
- Right this way, Mr. Santos.
- Shit! Come on.

07:56.115 --> 07:57.658
Go!

08:01.621 --> 08:03.455
Minka.

08:25.395 --> 08:27.479
- What are you doing?
- Ever seen "Batman"?

08:27.814 --> 08:28.897
No, I can't.

08:29.691 --> 08:30.816
No!

08:31.067 --> 08:32.109
No!

08:35.863 --> 08:36.905
Shut up!

08:43.871 --> 08:45.288
Goddamn it!

09:05.309 --> 09:07.644
Here's your little pride and joy.

09:09.689 --> 09:10.731
Thank you.

09:11.024 --> 09:13.191
Thank you
from the bottom of our hearts.

09:13.568 --> 09:15.777
We thought
we'd never see our little girl again.

09:16.041 --> 09:17.375
Thank you.

09:17.739 --> 09:19.865
Cut the shit! Where's my money?

09:21.993 --> 09:24.327
Honey, pay this woman.

09:24.746 --> 09:26.872
I'm afraid
there's been a slight problem.

09:27.165 --> 09:29.583
I could only come up
with half the money.

09:29.957 --> 09:31.791
Half the money?

09:31.961 --> 09:35.589
- Fine... I'll take half your daughter.
- Wait.

09:35.874 --> 09:38.375
I'm sure, we can negotiate something.

09:46.809 --> 09:49.102
The car plus the cash...

09:49.228 --> 09:51.146
Not a bad night's work.

09:52.523 --> 09:55.776
It was the middle
of the second American Civil War.

09:55.985 --> 09:58.111
The world had gone to hell.

09:58.488 --> 10:01.823
The year was 2017,
the worst year of my life.

10:01.991 --> 10:04.076
There was only one free city:

10:04.494 --> 10:08.538
And that's where I lived
for three years... port Steel Harbor.

10:09.332 --> 10:11.124
What a shithole!

10:23.096 --> 10:25.180
Why don't we start again?

10:26.432 --> 10:28.058
From the beginning.

10:28.434 --> 10:31.686
I told you...
I told you everything I know.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.124
I told you.

10:33.523 --> 10:35.232
Line's cleared up on screen one,
Colonel.

10:35.650 --> 10:37.442
Image is present.

10:39.362 --> 10:41.238
Image is recording.

10:42.281 --> 10:44.658
Citizen, I... I abhor torture.

10:45.034 --> 10:48.245
But your words
just don't match your thoughts.

10:48.579 --> 10:51.123
There are too many details
that you're just not sharing.

10:51.541 --> 10:54.084
Our little mind-reading device
doesn't lie.

10:57.755 --> 10:59.464
Reset sensors.

11:04.387 --> 11:07.389
Now,
where's doctor Corrina Devonshire?

11:07.583 --> 11:09.209
No! No!

11:23.739 --> 11:27.075
She's going to Steel Harbor,
the free city.

11:28.327 --> 11:31.705
Can you tell me,
why Cora D. is going to Steel Harbor?

11:31.914 --> 11:34.124
She's meeting
members of the resistance.

11:34.417 --> 11:37.127
They're giving her the retinal lenses.

11:37.461 --> 11:40.630
Helping her out of the country.
To Canada.

11:41.799 --> 11:44.926
She's with a freedom fighter...
named Axel.

11:45.219 --> 11:47.804
Who has the retinal lenses now?

11:47.972 --> 11:49.014
Krebs.

11:50.683 --> 11:51.808
William Krebs.

11:52.082 --> 11:54.207
How are they
getting her into the city?

11:55.354 --> 11:57.189
She's had plastic surgery.

11:58.357 --> 11:59.900
Her face is changed.

12:00.234 --> 12:01.860
You won't recognize her.

12:02.695 --> 12:05.780
- You'll never find her.
- You're so beautiful.

12:06.866 --> 12:07.908
I'm sorry.

12:08.201 --> 12:10.285
Colonel Pryzer,
Executive Council on line two.

12:10.703 --> 12:12.537
Tell him to hold.

12:23.132 --> 12:25.008
Put him on.

12:26.552 --> 12:30.889
Colonel Pryzer... any word yet
on our traitorous doctor, Cora D.?

12:31.182 --> 12:34.184
I'm not gonna pander
to that mythic name bullshit.

12:34.352 --> 12:38.939
Doctor Devonshire still poses
quite a problem to the Congressionals.

12:39.106 --> 12:43.235
Her escape may jeopardize
our strongest defensive action yet.

12:43.361 --> 12:45.278
I'm fully aware of that, citizen.

12:45.571 --> 12:50.367
Doctor Devonshire was privy to some of
the most sensitive military secrets.

12:50.701 --> 12:54.120
Her DNA holds the antidote
to our greatest biochemical weapon.

12:54.455 --> 12:57.123
She must be captured alive
at any cost.

12:57.458 --> 12:59.334
I'll take care of your problem.

12:59.752 --> 13:01.836
I'll get my hands dirty for you again.

13:02.129 --> 13:04.256
I wouldn't be cleaning up your mess

13:04.423 --> 13:07.008
<iconv() failed>

13:08.302 --> 13:10.220
Well, I...

13:11.389 --> 13:13.848
I had no direct knowledge
of that operation.

13:14.183 --> 13:17.435
Of course, it was a vital part
of our contract to...

13:17.603 --> 13:21.773
Save it for the U.N.
Doctor Corrina Devonshire, Cora D.,

13:22.066 --> 13:25.902
whatever she calls herself,
it really doesn't matter...

13:26.028 --> 13:28.196
She belongs to me.

13:28.322 --> 13:31.574
She's connecting
with a resistance contact named Krebs.

13:31.826 --> 13:33.285
He has the lenses

13:33.452 --> 13:35.745
and will be helping her
leave the Congressional territories.

13:35.913 --> 13:38.581
They're meeting in the free city,
Steel Harbor.

13:38.958 --> 13:41.960
I'll contact
their local authorities immediately.

13:42.128 --> 13:44.546
You see, I do my homework, citizen.

14:02.523 --> 14:03.982
It's them. Let's go.

14:10.614 --> 14:13.616
- Which one of you is Krebs?
- We meet him later.

14:15.786 --> 14:17.245
Hurry.

14:26.380 --> 14:28.548
I said, get to the back of the line!

14:35.056 --> 14:37.766
- I'll take those weapons.
- Don't lose the clip.

14:37.933 --> 14:39.809
Don't worry about it.

15:02.291 --> 15:04.709
Dry martinis and a Cuban cigar.

15:05.336 --> 15:06.961
You got it.

15:16.722 --> 15:19.015
Bubbly on the house!

15:31.237 --> 15:32.946
Please, leave it out.

15:36.826 --> 15:38.118
Excuse me. Curly!

15:39.495 --> 15:41.413
I'm still waiting
to hear from Miss Wire.

15:41.705 --> 15:43.665
I conveyed your offer to her.

15:43.874 --> 15:47.544
1500 Dollars to chop off
the legs of your ex-partner.

15:48.629 --> 15:51.756
You must be joking.
Naturally she declined.

15:52.091 --> 15:54.884
Miss Wire doesn't accept
this kind of job.

15:55.052 --> 15:56.511
Please!

15:57.888 --> 16:01.891
What?
My money's not good enough for her?

16:02.393 --> 16:05.603
I will make my offer in person!

16:05.771 --> 16:08.690
- If I were you, I wouldn't do that.
- Why?

16:08.899 --> 16:13.862
Her private secretary Camille doesn't
have you in her appointment book.

16:13.988 --> 16:17.031
- And she can be very mean.
- Let me through.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.994
- You see?
- Time for a couple of dedications.

16:21.287 --> 16:25.457
To Bobby from Colleen... The test
came back and everything's cool.

16:25.791 --> 16:28.793
And from Samantha to Cal...
"You thieving murderous bastard!

16:29.211 --> 16:32.714
If I ever see you again, I'll rip out
your eyes and pluck off your ears."

16:33.090 --> 16:35.467
Damn, if that just don't thug
at my heart strings.

16:35.759 --> 16:39.012
Now, here's a little rhythm
for you heartsick boys and girls.

16:39.346 --> 16:42.599
Chanel No. 5. Am I correct?

16:42.975 --> 16:44.601
Yes, you are.

16:46.395 --> 16:48.688
When I smelled it,
I thought to myself...

16:48.939 --> 16:52.609
"Charlie, now this is obviously
a woman of significant breeding."

16:52.985 --> 16:54.736
And then I thought...

16:54.945 --> 16:57.614
"I wonder if she'd like to do some?"

16:57.948 --> 17:01.743
Breeding, that is. What do you
think about that, sweetheart?

17:02.077 --> 17:04.162
Who are you talking to?

17:05.789 --> 17:07.915
Some chick.

17:08.834 --> 17:11.461
Where's your mercurial sister?

17:12.128 --> 17:14.547
Why don't you try the office?

17:14.714 --> 17:17.509
And when you see her,
tell her I only had two.

17:21.430 --> 17:24.098
Okay, whatever you say, Charlie.

17:24.266 --> 17:26.017
That's my boy.

17:38.280 --> 17:40.782
Goddamn. Customs police.

17:42.993 --> 17:45.453
Stay put. We'll handle this.

17:55.589 --> 17:57.131
Where's your ID?

17:57.466 --> 18:00.635
- Something feels wrong.
- This is making me very nervous.

18:01.053 --> 18:03.471
Look,
we just stick with the plan, okay?

18:05.516 --> 18:08.184
Change of plans! Let's go!

18:39.758 --> 18:41.426
Shit!

18:44.221 --> 18:45.888
Find them now!

19:00.279 --> 19:03.156
Sorry, boss. Is this a good moment
to talk about the payroll?

19:03.324 --> 19:05.742
- No.
- Tonight's fan mail.

19:08.245 --> 19:10.913
Three offers
to sell black market dollars...

19:11.123 --> 19:13.124
Another offer to buy the bar...

19:13.250 --> 19:16.628
An urgent request
to contact the resistance,

19:16.795 --> 19:19.213
and a badly-scented proposal
of marriage.

19:21.842 --> 19:23.926
No more valentines, Curly.

19:24.678 --> 19:26.512
Oh, it's awful.

19:27.306 --> 19:31.476
Look, boss, I hate
to keep bringing this up, I really do.

19:32.061 --> 19:34.145
But tomorrow's payday.

19:34.313 --> 19:37.315
What am I going to use for money,
a smile?

19:37.608 --> 19:39.400
Relax, Curly, I got it covered.

19:40.319 --> 19:42.528
- Are we going out?
- For a while.

19:42.655 --> 19:45.239
Just how far out are we going to go?

19:45.407 --> 19:47.325
I want to get some air.

19:47.493 --> 19:49.619
But I thought
you got some air last night?

19:49.745 --> 19:51.579
That didn't happen.

19:51.747 --> 19:53.956
This isn't happening either.

19:57.336 --> 19:59.587
Anybody asks,
I'm taking a bubble bath.

19:59.922 --> 20:01.798
Barb, I just don't like...

20:02.174 --> 20:05.635
Keep Charlie out from
under the tables. It's embarrassing.

20:06.011 --> 20:07.553
I will.

20:59.022 --> 21:00.690
Sweet dreams.

21:00.858 --> 21:03.901
Okay. Okay, let's go.

21:05.028 --> 21:06.070
Now what?

21:06.280 --> 21:07.905
We find Krebs.

21:08.073 --> 21:10.158
Any bright ideas how?

21:10.325 --> 21:11.868
Just one.

21:12.745 --> 21:15.663
I had to do a little moonlighting
to keep my bar running.

21:15.831 --> 21:19.959
Not an easy life. A girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

21:20.669 --> 21:24.464
And in this world
you gotta use everything you got.

21:24.631 --> 21:26.591
Hey, handsome, you want some company?

21:26.842 --> 21:28.926
You a cop?

21:31.305 --> 21:33.681
See a badge?

21:42.024 --> 21:44.442
You got your Med-Reg?

21:44.610 --> 21:47.069
Full medical, checked yesterday.

21:58.040 --> 22:01.876
- How much is this gonna cost me?
- That depends on how you wanna play.

22:02.211 --> 22:05.463
- I like to play rough.
- Me too.

22:11.053 --> 22:12.804
Hey, nice nuts!

22:14.097 --> 22:15.765
Get a life!

22:30.864 --> 22:33.324
Apartment four, seven, two...

22:33.450 --> 22:35.076
One guest.

22:38.956 --> 22:41.499
Retinal scan verified:
Ruben Tannenbaum,

22:41.667 --> 22:43.459
one, zero, eight, one, one.

23:27.671 --> 23:29.130
How romantic!

23:36.763 --> 23:39.015
I have an idea.

23:39.349 --> 23:42.059
Why don't you go change
into something more comfortable?

23:42.394 --> 23:44.520
How about
something a little less comfortable?

23:45.147 --> 23:47.565
I can hardly wait.

24:08.170 --> 24:10.046
Bingo! Mr. Krebs.

24:20.057 --> 24:21.724
Did you wash your hands?

24:21.975 --> 24:23.601
No.

24:23.769 --> 24:25.519
I was bad.

24:26.146 --> 24:27.939
I'm so glad to hear that.

24:41.036 --> 24:44.538
Now, close your eyes and turn around.

25:20.909 --> 25:22.243
What the hell?

25:27.916 --> 25:30.710
I wouldn't do that
if I were you, Krebs.

25:34.756 --> 25:36.632
Come on, move your ass!

25:38.719 --> 25:40.094
Shit!

25:58.822 --> 26:00.072
Go ahead, go!

27:11.603 --> 27:14.021
- You're not going soft on me, are you?
- Okay.

27:14.189 --> 27:16.107
You can have him.

27:17.025 --> 27:18.275
Good.

27:19.361 --> 27:22.113
You're my last bail jumper, Krebs.

27:23.406 --> 27:25.116
Wake up, sunshine.

27:26.451 --> 27:29.203
- Please don't kill me.
- That was nice kicking.

27:29.371 --> 27:31.622
You really know your stuff, babe.

27:33.792 --> 27:35.960
What did you call me?

27:40.257 --> 27:42.675
Don't call me babe!

27:59.067 --> 28:00.776
Goddamn it!

28:16.835 --> 28:18.043
Ah, Mr. Krebs.

28:19.504 --> 28:21.463
It's a pleasure to see you.

28:21.673 --> 28:24.216
You know,
we were getting very concerned.

28:25.260 --> 28:26.302
And Barb...

28:27.304 --> 28:29.763
it's a pleasure to see you too.

28:29.931 --> 28:32.600
You're looking
rather buoyant this evening.

28:32.809 --> 28:35.019
Shut up! My fee?

28:35.270 --> 28:37.021
- 10'000...
- No!

28:37.147 --> 28:39.440
The price went up for this one,
Schmitz.

28:39.649 --> 28:43.068
- We had an agreement.
- You told me he was alone and unarmed.

28:43.403 --> 28:45.487
- He wasn't.
- Sorry.

28:45.697 --> 28:50.784
How could I know that? Bounty hunting
is an ugly, unpredictable business.

28:51.077 --> 28:53.120
You of all people should know that.

28:53.413 --> 28:55.122
How much?

28:56.041 --> 28:57.124
20'000.

29:04.674 --> 29:06.759
Canadian.

29:06.927 --> 29:08.636
Miss Wire.

29:10.680 --> 29:13.891
I do believe
that I'm being extorted here!

29:14.184 --> 29:18.020
As a duly authorized officer
of the court, I must protest!

29:19.397 --> 29:21.357
Look at it this way, Schmitz:

29:21.524 --> 29:25.653
Alive, Krebs represents
your investment in this bail bond.

29:26.363 --> 29:28.656
Dead, he's toxic waste.

29:31.409 --> 29:32.451
20'000,

29:32.577 --> 29:34.453
Canadian, now!

29:48.343 --> 29:51.011
It's a pleasure
doing business with you, Barb.

29:51.179 --> 29:53.847
If it was a pleasure, I'd charge more.

30:25.922 --> 30:28.924
- Everything go okay?
- Candy from a baby.

30:30.385 --> 30:33.387
- Pay the help, for God's sake.
- Please, not in public.

30:33.555 --> 30:36.265
Excuse me, Miss Wire? I... I...

30:36.599 --> 30:39.977
I'm going back
to the front lines tomorrow,

30:40.270 --> 30:43.605
and I was wondering...
You look beautiful. Would...

30:43.815 --> 30:46.191
Would you dance with me?

30:46.651 --> 30:49.278
Come on, Barb, give him a thrill.

30:51.281 --> 30:53.240
Come on.

31:21.770 --> 31:26.273
I can't believe, I'm actually dancing
with the Barb Wire!

31:27.400 --> 31:29.485
Where are you from, soldier?

31:30.528 --> 31:34.281
Steamboat Springs, Colorado,
or what's left of it.

31:34.449 --> 31:37.117
Did you hear, the Congressionals
just took over Denver?

31:37.285 --> 31:40.371
No, I didn't.
Do you have a girl back home?

31:41.414 --> 31:42.956
Yeah.

31:43.124 --> 31:46.251
- Do you miss her?
- Yes, ma'am, every day.

31:47.128 --> 31:49.797
I tell you what: close your eyes

31:49.964 --> 31:53.217
and let's pretend
she's right here in your arms.

31:53.343 --> 31:55.052
Yes, ma'am.

32:08.608 --> 32:11.902
Everyone, stay where you are!
This is the police.

32:12.070 --> 32:15.280
Willis,
Steel Harbor's Chief of Police.

32:15.573 --> 32:19.034
He was a drunk with sticky fingers.
But at least, he was honest.

32:19.202 --> 32:21.286
He admitted,
he was a liar and a thief.

32:21.413 --> 32:23.914
- Check his ID.
- Yes, sir.

32:31.464 --> 32:34.341
Retinal scan verified:
Lawrence Crabtree,

32:34.509 --> 32:36.176
five, seven, two, three, nine.

32:36.469 --> 32:38.345
Ben Jones, eh?

32:39.556 --> 32:41.181
Arrest him.

32:44.477 --> 32:46.520
Good luck, soldier.

32:52.944 --> 32:55.028
- Next.
- Right, get over.

32:56.990 --> 33:00.242
- Retinal scan verified: Martha Berg.
- Arrest her.

33:00.368 --> 33:04.037
- Willis, what the hell is going on?
- Barb, how lovely to see you.

33:04.330 --> 33:05.914
What gives?

33:06.082 --> 33:08.000
It's a messy business tonight.

33:08.334 --> 33:12.588
Most unpleasant: a rather spectacular
double homicide in the old harbor.

33:12.964 --> 33:15.966
- So?
- So, we're checking a few IDs.

33:17.218 --> 33:20.345
We have reason to believe, this
might have been resistance-related.

33:20.680 --> 33:25.392
As your bar is non-discriminating
to this town's more nefarious side...

33:25.560 --> 33:29.062
- How long is this gonna take?
- Everything's negotiable.

33:32.567 --> 33:34.651
- Curly...
- Music!

33:40.408 --> 33:43.118
You really upgraded this place
from what it was, Barb.

33:43.286 --> 33:46.330
I like the new sound system.
Sounds expensive.

33:46.664 --> 33:50.125
- I've been saving my lunch money.
- Didn't know you opened for lunch.

33:50.793 --> 33:53.962
Now, a little gun running here,
some bail jumping there,

33:54.130 --> 33:56.006
the occasional midnight detonation:

33:56.341 --> 33:58.842
Those are the kind of jobs
that pay for new toys.

33:59.093 --> 34:01.470
- I don't moonlight.
- I do.

34:04.432 --> 34:07.476
- It's profitable.
- What's with the bullshit arrests?

34:08.811 --> 34:11.313
You sold half those
Congressional IDs yourself.

34:11.438 --> 34:13.524
Moi? Bullshit arrests?

34:14.442 --> 34:16.318
Two of my men are dead.

34:16.444 --> 34:20.656
Now granted, they were
homicidal thugs, but they were my men.

34:21.074 --> 34:23.158
What makes you think
resistance was involved?

34:27.330 --> 34:31.333
Why? Do you have any
other information I should know about?

34:31.501 --> 34:33.168
Of course not.

34:33.710 --> 34:35.379
Of course not.

34:36.255 --> 34:38.840
That's sexual harassment, Chief.

34:40.009 --> 34:41.969
Listen, Barbara Kopetsky,

34:42.136 --> 34:44.429
we can play this
cat and mouse game all night long.

34:44.556 --> 34:47.474
But I have
more important things on my mind.

34:47.641 --> 34:49.893
Now, where the hell is William Krebs?

34:50.103 --> 34:51.853
Never heard of him.

34:52.522 --> 34:54.606
Why are your men watching him?

34:56.775 --> 34:59.194
That's classified police business.

35:03.992 --> 35:05.617
I can tell you he was resistance

35:05.827 --> 35:08.453
and the Congressionals have
a million dollar bounty on his head.

35:08.746 --> 35:13.500
So if someone knew where Krebs was,
I can make it worth their while.

35:13.751 --> 35:15.210
Goodbye, Willis.

35:17.005 --> 35:18.547
Okay.

35:20.258 --> 35:24.219
By the way, we're expecting
some distinguished visitors tomorrow.

35:24.762 --> 35:26.930
A Congressional delegation
out of Washington

35:27.265 --> 35:30.392
including First Directorate,
Colonel Victor Pryzer.

35:30.685 --> 35:33.604
- Might bring them by the Hammerhead.
- Their money will be welcome.

35:33.771 --> 35:35.856
You don't know Victor Pryzer.

35:36.608 --> 35:41.612
Speaking of money, I don't have to
make more arrests for the usual 3000.

35:41.738 --> 35:42.779
1500.

35:43.740 --> 35:45.449
1500...

35:45.742 --> 35:48.660
I better go downstairs
checking some more IDs.

35:50.747 --> 35:52.831
2500.

35:53.207 --> 35:55.542
- Two grand.
- Darling.

35:56.419 --> 36:00.547
- 30 bucks for the cognac.
- Add it to my tab, Miss Kopetski.

36:02.550 --> 36:04.760
Miss Kopetski died in the war.

36:05.553 --> 36:07.387
I'm Barb Wire.

36:19.275 --> 36:22.319
Some cigarettes and a drink,
then I'll be fine.

36:23.237 --> 36:25.197
Give me a goddamn drink!

36:25.990 --> 36:29.159
You, you or you!
Just give me my drink!

36:29.535 --> 36:32.579
- Sir, we're not open yet.
- You've had enough already.

36:32.830 --> 36:34.164
Blow me!

36:35.291 --> 36:37.084
Camille... package check.

36:41.798 --> 36:43.465
Get her off of me!

36:43.800 --> 36:46.259
That's Camille. She works here.

36:47.887 --> 36:49.304
Camille, sit.

36:52.934 --> 36:56.228
- You don't wanna see her roll over.
- No, no, no.

36:56.437 --> 36:58.605
Good. Camille, outside.

37:05.029 --> 37:07.364
- Have a nice day.
- Yes, ma'am.

37:26.008 --> 37:28.135
Willis, what's with the monkey suit?

37:29.470 --> 37:32.472
You know how uniforms
impress the Congressionals.

37:32.807 --> 37:34.516
The delegation arrived this morning.

37:34.809 --> 37:36.643
Look lively.
They could be here any minute.

37:36.978 --> 37:38.645
Excuse me, Barb.

37:39.397 --> 37:42.315
- My table?
- Best in the house, as you requested.

37:42.650 --> 37:45.193
Just keep them away
from the weapons check.

37:45.403 --> 37:48.905
We don't want our customers from
the United Front trying to get even.

37:49.031 --> 37:53.493
I think you'll find our guests
from Washington command more respect.

37:53.828 --> 37:55.871
You're confusing respect with fear.

38:29.113 --> 38:30.864
Speak of the devil.

38:31.699 --> 38:34.284
They are punctual,
I'll give them that.

38:36.245 --> 38:39.498
You'll join us for a drink later.
On my tab, of course.

38:41.042 --> 38:42.709
Fat chance!

38:44.212 --> 38:48.340
Colonel Pryzer. Alexander Willis,
Director of Police Operations.

38:48.466 --> 38:50.300
Welcome to Steel Harbor.

38:50.468 --> 38:52.886
Wipe that smile off your face, Willis.

38:53.095 --> 38:57.307
This burnt-out hellhole is
the last place on earth I want to be!

38:58.059 --> 39:01.228
If it wasn't
for your almost complete incompetence,

39:01.395 --> 39:03.730
I wouldn't be here in the first place,
would I?

39:03.898 --> 39:05.565
Yes. Needless to say,

39:05.733 --> 39:10.070
we had intended to have both Krebs
and Cora D. sent to Washington by now.

39:10.279 --> 39:12.948
However, due to circumstances
outside of our control...

39:13.115 --> 39:15.075
Listen... carefully!

39:17.495 --> 39:19.371
If Cora D. escapes,

39:20.540 --> 39:24.084
I will personally
rip your heart out of your ass

39:24.836 --> 39:27.462
and stuff it back down your throat!

39:28.798 --> 39:30.882
That's not very sanitary.

39:38.432 --> 39:42.435
Baby, you tell me it's late, but
I tell you, it only feels that way.

39:42.728 --> 39:47.274
So sit back and enjoy someone or
something elicit, if you can get it,

39:47.650 --> 39:49.776
and listen to the music.

39:49.861 --> 39:52.988
Gentlemen,
the steaks are excellent tonight.

39:56.284 --> 40:00.871
Colonel Pryzer, allow me to introduce
our hostess, the inimitable...

40:01.038 --> 40:04.583
Even in Washington...
we've heard of Barb Wire.

40:05.418 --> 40:07.294
I hope you'll join us.

40:09.797 --> 40:12.007
You attract a very eclectic crowd.

40:12.675 --> 40:14.134
It looks that way.

40:14.552 --> 40:16.845
Rumor has it you used to fight
with the resistance?

40:17.138 --> 40:19.598
Shouldn't believe everything you hear.

40:19.807 --> 40:23.768
- I'm neutral. I'm a business woman.
- Perhaps we can do business.

40:24.103 --> 40:28.356
I can assure you, Barb has
a very keen sense of commerce.

40:28.649 --> 40:30.942
Then I'll get to the point.

40:31.152 --> 40:33.528
There's a fugitive, a traitor,
in Steel Harbor.

40:33.821 --> 40:36.448
She intends to make
a crossing into Canada with the help

40:36.782 --> 40:38.992
of some more disenchanted members.

40:39.160 --> 40:40.744
Do I look disenchanted to you?

40:40.995 --> 40:45.373
Your business dealings bring you
in contact with all levels of society.

40:45.750 --> 40:47.667
I thought
you were getting to the point.

40:48.002 --> 40:52.631
Her name is doctor Corrina Devonshire.
You may have heard of her as Cora D.

40:52.924 --> 40:56.551
One of those
overly romanticized resistance names.

40:56.844 --> 40:58.720
It keeps her legend alive.

40:58.971 --> 41:01.640
- What does she look like?
- We're not sure.

41:01.807 --> 41:04.517
She had her appearance
surgically altered.

41:04.685 --> 41:07.479
These are photos of her before.

41:09.357 --> 41:11.858
It's hard to find somebody
unless you know what she looks like.

41:12.193 --> 41:14.861
Her present appearance
is of no consequence.

41:15.196 --> 41:18.740
Identification can always be made
by retinal scanning.

41:19.033 --> 41:19.908
So?

41:21.785 --> 41:24.078
The Congressionals
can count on your assistance?

41:24.330 --> 41:28.124
Excuse me, boss.
Trouble in the kitchen. I need you.

41:29.335 --> 41:31.252
Excuse me, gentlemen,

41:31.670 --> 41:33.963
I have a bar to run.

41:39.011 --> 41:42.931
- Very interesting woman.
- With most impressive assets.

41:44.099 --> 41:46.267
Gentlemen... There you are, sir.

42:03.911 --> 42:07.163
Act natural?
That's easier said than done.

42:21.845 --> 42:25.682
Two beers, buddy. I'm looking
for a Barb or Charlie Kopetski.

42:26.892 --> 42:29.185
Barb is out there.

42:35.651 --> 42:37.902
The Congressionals!

42:40.072 --> 42:43.616
- They have my photographs.
- Let's hope resistance are here.

42:43.784 --> 42:47.495
- They are looking everywhere for you.
- Who are we meeting?

42:47.871 --> 42:49.455
Someone I used to know.

42:49.832 --> 42:51.207
Wait here.

43:09.977 --> 43:11.686
Hello, Charlie.

43:14.023 --> 43:17.483
This must be
a post-traumatic stress flashback.

43:17.651 --> 43:21.779
I could swear I just heard
an old voice from the battle fields.

43:21.947 --> 43:23.740
Surprised to see me?

43:27.036 --> 43:29.829
Do I look surprised?

43:30.080 --> 43:31.956
Guess you didn't hear.

43:32.791 --> 43:36.961
A Congressional smart grenade.
It followed me to my foxhole.

43:37.254 --> 43:39.547
I thought I'd dug it deep enough.

43:40.215 --> 43:42.216
I guess I didn't.

43:42.342 --> 43:44.635
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

43:44.970 --> 43:46.179
Me too.

43:46.555 --> 43:48.639
Miss, two bourbons.

43:49.808 --> 43:52.101
You don't have to buy me a drink,
Axel.

43:52.519 --> 43:56.314
I'm tight with the management here.
You got a lot of nerve coming in here.

43:57.941 --> 43:59.734
I had no choice.

44:00.249 --> 44:01.958
Where's Barb?

44:02.071 --> 44:04.947
I don't think talking to Barb
is such a good idea.

44:05.074 --> 44:08.326
She took Seattle
a hell of a lot harder than I did.

44:08.494 --> 44:12.246
I need her help. I need her to put us
in touch with local resistance.

44:13.957 --> 44:15.833
Haven't you heard?

44:16.877 --> 44:18.795
Barb's retired.

44:20.756 --> 44:24.008
Leave. Now. Before Barb sees you.

44:24.259 --> 44:26.886
There's no telling what she might do.

44:28.430 --> 44:29.514
Too late.

44:33.435 --> 44:35.144
Three,

44:35.813 --> 44:37.563
- Two...
- Hello, Barb.

44:38.315 --> 44:40.066
One!

44:44.279 --> 44:47.365
- Okay, I guess I deserved that.
- Get out!

44:48.033 --> 44:50.034
- I need your help.
- Rot in hell!

44:50.327 --> 44:53.162
I remember
when you believed in something.

44:53.455 --> 44:56.666
I remember how it felt,
like I was kicked in the stomach.

44:57.042 --> 44:59.752
I've got 24 hours
to find a man named Krebs.

44:59.920 --> 45:02.713
I don't know how I feel.
I don't feel much of anything anymore.

45:03.048 --> 45:06.050
- Will you just trust me please?
- Like I did in Seattle?

45:06.385 --> 45:09.262
What happened there isn't what
you think. I never wanted to hurt you.

45:09.680 --> 45:13.224
- Now is not the time to explain.
- You're three years late.

45:13.392 --> 45:15.309
Get out and don't come back!

45:15.686 --> 45:17.311
Your check, sir.

45:26.321 --> 45:28.739
Such blatant disregard for money.

45:33.036 --> 45:34.996
Thank you for your hospitality.

45:35.247 --> 45:38.166
And I do hope
you'll think about our offer.

45:46.842 --> 45:48.718
I'm thinking about it.

45:53.640 --> 45:55.725
I knew I shouldn't have come here.

45:55.851 --> 45:57.852
That woman's in love with you.

45:59.938 --> 46:02.273
There's a lot of things
I need to tell you.

46:02.691 --> 46:05.443
- I hope it's sooner than later.
- Axel, over here!

46:06.236 --> 46:07.778
Charlie.

46:08.488 --> 46:10.740
I can help.

46:11.533 --> 46:13.659
The blind leading the blind.

46:16.955 --> 46:21.459
Go to the old factory district to a
place called Steel Harbor Metal House.

46:21.668 --> 46:23.628
It's a front for the resistance.

46:23.962 --> 46:26.547
There's a stairway in the back,
near the loading dock.

46:26.798 --> 46:28.257
Watch yourself.

46:41.396 --> 46:42.939
Shit!

46:56.453 --> 46:58.162
Who are you?

46:58.455 --> 47:00.539
Charlie Kopetski sent us.

47:00.749 --> 47:02.959
Doesn't matter who I am
but this is Cora D.

47:03.335 --> 47:04.377
Scan her.

47:12.552 --> 47:16.138
Retinal scan verified:
doctor Corrina Devonshire,

47:16.223 --> 47:18.683
four, four, seven, nine, one.

47:19.309 --> 47:21.686
Cora D., I'm honored.

47:21.853 --> 47:26.148
We've been looking for you. I never
thought I'd meet the legend in person.

47:26.275 --> 47:28.442
I'm commander here.
They call me Spike.

47:29.861 --> 47:31.779
- You're so young.
- Maybe.

47:32.072 --> 47:35.741
- But I'm tough.
- Well, we're glad we found you.

47:35.909 --> 47:38.411
We hope that you can help us, Spike.

47:39.788 --> 47:42.081
It took us a while but we found Krebs.

47:42.332 --> 47:44.959
The lenses are gone,
not to mention his eyeballs.

47:45.252 --> 47:48.462
We found him in an abandoned washing
machine behind the old V.A. hospital.

47:48.839 --> 47:51.757
- The Congressionals took the lenses?
- No.

47:51.925 --> 47:54.385
They're still looking for Krebs,
we know that.

47:54.720 --> 47:58.764
Willis and the cops don't know squat.
Everybody's chasing their tail.

47:59.057 --> 48:00.808
Who's got the contact lenses now?

48:00.976 --> 48:04.937
Word on the street is Krebs was turned
over to a bail bondsman named Schmitz.

48:05.230 --> 48:09.150
Schmitz was aiming to turn Krebs over
to the Congressionals for the bounty.

48:09.401 --> 48:13.279
- But then they got wise to the lenses.
- They are worth two million.

48:13.572 --> 48:18.200
Without them I won't be able to get
past the scan and get on that plane.

48:18.368 --> 48:22.121
- Let's not wait. Let's get Schmitz!
- It's not that easy, doc.

48:22.247 --> 48:25.333
- We can't find him.
- The plane leaves in 24 hours.

48:25.751 --> 48:27.126
Somebody must help us.

48:27.419 --> 48:30.921
Only one person at Steel Harbor
has connections on all sides.

48:31.214 --> 48:33.257
If anyone would know
where Schmitz is, she would.

48:33.550 --> 48:36.635
The trouble is,
she won't help nobody for free

48:36.845 --> 48:39.513
and we're a little low on cash.

48:41.933 --> 48:45.686
You know I do, Connie.
Don't make me say it.

48:45.854 --> 48:47.938
I love you. Bye.

48:49.983 --> 48:52.068
- What are you two laughing at?
- Who was that?

48:52.235 --> 48:54.528
- Your mother.
- Give me three.

48:54.780 --> 48:56.280
How many?

48:56.406 --> 48:58.157
Put that down!

49:00.494 --> 49:02.661
- How many more?
- Give me two.

49:07.042 --> 49:10.294
- Your bet, Moe.
- I'll bet, when I get ready.

49:10.462 --> 49:11.670
Just wait.

49:27.479 --> 49:29.188
Ten-hut!

49:46.206 --> 49:47.873
Don't know how you do things
in Washington,

49:48.083 --> 49:51.210
but I do make the occasional arrest
without slaughter.

49:56.508 --> 50:00.553
You incompetent.
We needed to make an interrogation.

50:00.887 --> 50:02.972
Sorry, sir, they resisted.

50:12.858 --> 50:15.359
Is any of these men Schmitz?

50:16.778 --> 50:18.362
No.

50:25.579 --> 50:27.413
Look who's here.

50:29.124 --> 50:30.666
Krebs.

50:30.876 --> 50:32.501
Cora D. can't be far.

50:35.380 --> 50:37.465
I'll need one of the bodies.

50:38.717 --> 50:42.261
Preferably...
one without a head wound.

51:08.121 --> 51:11.457
- Hey. You want some company?
- No.

51:12.626 --> 51:15.336
Okay. Do you want some advice?

51:17.005 --> 51:18.464
No!

51:19.174 --> 51:20.716
Okay.

51:25.680 --> 51:30.392
Drink when you want to remember.
Don't drink when you want to forget.

51:35.148 --> 51:36.774
I'll be there.

51:37.692 --> 51:39.360
I promise.

51:45.116 --> 51:46.700
Let's move!

51:48.286 --> 51:51.747
- Barb, we have to go now!
- No, he'll be here!

51:53.458 --> 51:54.500
Barb!

51:56.378 --> 51:57.836
Axel!

51:58.046 --> 51:59.797
Are you Barbara Kopetski?

52:00.173 --> 52:04.426
- Yes. Where's Axel?
- He's not here. He's not coming.

52:04.761 --> 52:08.347
He said he's sorry
but you gotta get out of here.

52:08.682 --> 52:11.892
You guys gotta get out of here!
Go! Go! Go!

52:12.102 --> 52:13.561
That's it. Let's go!

52:15.730 --> 52:17.898
Come on, get in! Get in!

52:32.163 --> 52:34.623
You cheated me
out of one million bucks, Schmitz!

52:35.041 --> 52:37.251
I should blow your head off right now.

52:38.336 --> 52:41.338
Lucky for me you don't hold a grudge.

52:41.798 --> 52:43.507
Don't I?

52:45.677 --> 52:49.096
A million dollars is pocket change
to what's going down.

52:49.264 --> 52:51.682
I got a business proposition
for you.

52:51.850 --> 52:55.352
- You got connections, everyone knows.
- I don't take sides.

52:55.687 --> 52:58.314
Exactly... You deal with everybody.

52:58.607 --> 53:01.567
- I got something to deal.
- You can't sell Krebs on your own?

53:01.943 --> 53:04.236
It's not about Krebs anymore.

53:04.404 --> 53:06.655
It's about retinal contact lenses.

53:08.408 --> 53:10.284
Smuggled in from Germany.

53:10.577 --> 53:13.203
You put these in your eyes,
you get through any retinal scanner.

53:13.538 --> 53:15.122
Congressional or U.N.

53:15.498 --> 53:17.541
I was gonna sell them
but my buyer fell through.

53:17.876 --> 53:20.210
Krebs was resistance.

53:20.879 --> 53:23.797
Those belonged to his friends.
Do yourself a favor:

53:24.174 --> 53:26.342
Just give them back
and say you're sorry.

53:27.344 --> 53:29.553
Goddamn it Barb, I can't.

53:29.679 --> 53:31.972
They'll kill me and you know it.

53:36.227 --> 53:38.896
The Congressionals
broke into my office.

53:39.814 --> 53:42.149
They slaughtered everybody.

53:42.317 --> 53:44.735
They were looking for me.

53:45.904 --> 53:48.822
With or without these,
I'm a dead man.

53:50.367 --> 53:53.327
Relax, Schmitz, you can only die once.

54:00.710 --> 54:02.711
Barb?

54:03.630 --> 54:05.798
I know I double-crossed you.

54:06.925 --> 54:09.301
I made a mistake. It happens.

54:11.471 --> 54:14.223
I want to trade the lenses.

54:15.475 --> 54:18.268
- I want to trade them to you.
- For what?

54:18.937 --> 54:21.939
Get me out of Steel Harbor.
Canada maybe.

54:22.607 --> 54:24.983
Just get me out and they're yours.

54:25.193 --> 54:29.571
You want out?
Click your heels together three times.

54:29.864 --> 54:32.658
You could sell these.
Do you know how much they're worth?

54:33.660 --> 54:36.620
You could get two mil...
Canadian... easy.

54:37.789 --> 54:42.626
Enough money for Europe. You could
get an operation for Charlie's eyes.

54:42.919 --> 54:45.587
I don't buy. I don't sell.

54:47.132 --> 54:48.966
Get out!

54:53.847 --> 54:56.056
You're gonna regret
not dealing with me!

54:56.433 --> 54:59.226
You're gonna regret this
very, very much.

55:00.395 --> 55:03.063
I'll add that to my list.

55:36.055 --> 55:37.931
The subject is reasonably fresh.

55:38.349 --> 55:40.893
We'll probably only get a few seconds
of readable thought data.

55:41.269 --> 55:45.022
Cognitive impressions, those closest
to death first. And then what's left:

55:45.231 --> 55:47.024
memories, dreams.

55:47.192 --> 55:49.943
- Record it.
- Sir. Step away from the tank.

56:04.292 --> 56:07.377
- That's it?
- Here it is in slow motion, Colonel.

56:20.767 --> 56:23.268
Issue a warrant
for the arrest of Barb Wire.

56:23.436 --> 56:26.897
Issue a warrant?
This isn't Washington, Pryzer.

56:27.065 --> 56:29.900
- I need a reason.
- She's involved.

56:30.819 --> 56:35.656
Well, you heard what he said.
Sometimes all you get are dreams.

56:35.782 --> 56:39.409
Every man in Steel Harbor
dreams about Barb Wire.

56:39.577 --> 56:43.789
- I need something more conclusive...
- When did the law ever matter to you?

56:44.165 --> 56:46.834
Miss Wire may know the whereabouts
of the retinal lenses.

56:47.252 --> 56:50.087
- We will search her bar.
- Retinal lenses?

56:50.797 --> 56:52.756
All of this
is over a set of Bausch and Lombs?

56:53.007 --> 56:57.344
All of this is over capturing an enemy
of the Republic, the traitor Cora D.

56:57.720 --> 57:01.098
If Cora D. were to exit
this charming free city,

57:02.475 --> 57:07.396
your relationship with the Republic
would be severely compromised.

57:09.065 --> 57:11.567
Painfully compromised.

57:13.570 --> 57:16.071
Do I make myself clear?

57:18.783 --> 57:22.077
Your administrative fee should cover
the cost of issuing a search warrant.

57:22.287 --> 57:24.496
Now, find a reason
to search the Hammerhead!

57:24.831 --> 57:26.915
As you wish, Colonel.

57:27.500 --> 57:29.293
As you wish.

58:16.507 --> 58:18.050
I'm unarmed.

58:18.384 --> 58:21.386
How did you get in here?
Where's my dog?

58:22.597 --> 58:24.890
I'm irresistible to females.

58:27.852 --> 58:29.519
Thanks, Camille.

58:32.815 --> 58:34.274
Towel!

58:37.195 --> 58:40.364
- What? Are you gonna shoot me?
- Why waste a good bullet?

58:40.531 --> 58:43.408
I thought I told you
never to come back?

58:44.827 --> 58:46.703
I came here to do a job.

58:47.288 --> 58:49.706
The biggest operation
I ever signed up for.

58:49.874 --> 58:54.002
I came ready for anything
the Congressionals could lob at me.

58:54.170 --> 58:57.631
The only thing I wasn't prepared for
was running into you.

58:57.799 --> 59:00.050
You'll get over it. I did.

59:06.182 --> 59:08.100
I wouldn't have come here
unless I had to.

59:08.267 --> 59:10.060
I wouldn't be here
if I knew you were coming.

59:10.395 --> 59:11.895
Goddamn it!

59:18.486 --> 59:21.113
I guess
it's bad timing for both of us.

59:36.629 --> 59:39.131
Am I interrupting something?

59:40.842 --> 59:42.926
Lovely you brought company.

59:50.518 --> 59:52.602
Barb, this is my wife, Cora D.

59:54.313 --> 59:58.859
How impressive. I'm sure you'll have
very strong, smart children.

59:59.193 --> 01:00:02.195
Look, I know
this is awkward for all of us.

01:00:02.363 --> 01:00:07.492
You gotta know, all I wanted back
in Seattle was to disappear with you.

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:11.038
- The war changed that.
- The war changed everything.

01:00:11.205 --> 01:00:12.831
Good one.

01:00:12.957 --> 01:00:15.000
I'm not surprised
you don't believe me.

01:00:15.293 --> 01:00:17.836
The mission took months.
I thought after all that time

01:00:18.129 --> 01:00:19.880
I was better left a part of your past.

01:00:20.173 --> 01:00:22.758
That's why I didn't get
an invitation to your wedding?

01:00:23.092 --> 01:00:25.927
Barb, there's more to the story
than meets the eye.

01:00:26.095 --> 01:00:28.263
Do you remember
what happened in Topeka, Kansas?

01:00:28.598 --> 01:00:32.017
How the whole city was wiped out?
I can explain.

01:00:32.393 --> 01:00:35.145
I was Chief of Medical Research
for the Congressional Directorate.

01:00:35.563 --> 01:00:39.483
I was directly but unknowingly
involved in a global project,

01:00:39.692 --> 01:00:42.027
an HIV derivative
known as Red Ribbon.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.529
It can kill you in twelve hours.

01:00:44.697 --> 01:00:47.699
When I learned that Topeka, Kansas,
was a lab experiment

01:00:48.034 --> 01:00:51.411
and the Congressionals planned
to unleash it on the entire territory,

01:00:51.579 --> 01:00:55.415
I defected to the resistance.
Axel got me out of Washington.

01:00:57.043 --> 01:01:00.962
Initially we married on paper
purely for identification purposes.

01:01:01.255 --> 01:01:06.176
- We've been on the run ever since.
- How utterly, goddamn heroic!

01:01:06.344 --> 01:01:09.387
Now, what the hell
do you want with me?

01:01:09.597 --> 01:01:11.640
Cora has the vaccine
to Red Ribbon in her system.

01:01:12.016 --> 01:01:15.310
The Congressionals want it back.
We have to get her to Canada

01:01:15.645 --> 01:01:17.896
to tell the Truth Commission
there's a cure.

01:01:18.231 --> 01:01:20.732
We have to tell the world.
We need your help.

01:01:21.025 --> 01:01:22.818
The cause needs your help.

01:01:22.985 --> 01:01:25.946
What has the cause done for me lately?

01:01:26.948 --> 01:01:29.366
Barb, where are the contact lenses?

01:01:29.784 --> 01:01:33.662
- If I knew you think I'd tell you?
- We know that Schmitz was here.

01:01:34.038 --> 01:01:38.125
Now, if you know where the lenses are,
for Christ's sake, name a price.

01:01:38.417 --> 01:01:42.295
That's what you do, isn't it?
Sell yourself to the highest bidder?

01:01:42.922 --> 01:01:44.881
I'm out of your price range.

01:02:03.484 --> 01:02:06.444
- Is there another way out of here?
- Are you kidding?

01:02:06.612 --> 01:02:08.738
The other way is covered.

01:02:11.826 --> 01:02:13.869
Roll it, ladies.

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:33.889
Give me three minutes
and meet me downstairs.

01:02:35.683 --> 01:02:38.810
- Why should we trust you?
- Maybe you shouldn't.

01:02:44.108 --> 01:02:45.901
- Check him!
- Yes, sir.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.195
Put his head back.

01:02:48.321 --> 01:02:49.905
Oh god!

01:02:50.239 --> 01:02:53.116
He doesn't have any retinals,
you morons!

01:02:55.661 --> 01:02:57.746
Sorry about that, Charlie.

01:03:06.047 --> 01:03:09.382
- We're not open for breakfast.
- It's legal. We have a warrant.

01:03:11.552 --> 01:03:13.553
It's a little sticky.

01:03:14.305 --> 01:03:19.476
- What exactly are you looking for?
- This... is a murder investigation.

01:03:19.644 --> 01:03:23.313
It's a Congressional matter.
I can assure you, citizen,

01:03:23.481 --> 01:03:27.025
if we discover that you're involved,
the consequences will be abrupt

01:03:27.318 --> 01:03:29.027
and severe.

01:03:31.989 --> 01:03:34.241
- Who are they?
- I picked them up off the boulevard.

01:03:34.575 --> 01:03:37.827
I like a good menage
every now and then.

01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:43.667
Go out through the back.

01:03:44.335 --> 01:03:46.002
Scan them.

01:03:46.712 --> 01:03:48.505
This is ridiculous.

01:03:51.133 --> 01:03:53.009
Commence scan.

01:04:01.727 --> 01:04:04.604
Sir, the scanner is broken, sir.

01:04:05.731 --> 01:04:07.440
Idiot!

01:04:09.151 --> 01:04:11.945
You're wasting my time. Get out!

01:04:13.864 --> 01:04:15.949
How long is this gonna take?

01:04:17.201 --> 01:04:21.162
As long as it takes, citizen.
As long as it takes.

01:05:49.502 --> 01:05:51.795
I wish you could see this mess.

01:05:52.338 --> 01:05:54.964
I couldn't see it when it was clean.

01:05:55.132 --> 01:05:57.634
What the hell
were they looking for anyway?

01:05:57.843 --> 01:06:00.512
- Stupid contact lenses.
- Oh yeah?

01:06:01.347 --> 01:06:04.724
Schmitz was here last night trying
to trade them for a trip to Canada.

01:06:04.975 --> 01:06:06.434
I should've done it.

01:06:06.602 --> 01:06:08.686
- Contact lenses?
- Yeah.

01:06:12.108 --> 01:06:13.733
Like these?

01:06:15.694 --> 01:06:17.570
What color are they?

01:06:18.489 --> 01:06:20.323
The color of money.

01:06:20.491 --> 01:06:22.325
We can give them to Axel
and help them escape.

01:06:22.451 --> 01:06:24.285
This is our ticket to Europe.

01:06:24.412 --> 01:06:27.539
- They don't belong to us!
- Finders keepers.

01:06:27.706 --> 01:06:30.041
I still believe
in fighting for what's right!

01:06:30.209 --> 01:06:33.002
Cheer up, baby brother. We're rich.

01:06:34.171 --> 01:06:36.381
You're making a mistake, Barb.

01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:38.716
- Tell me that when we get to Paris.
- A big one!

01:06:38.884 --> 01:06:42.262
- Charlie, you worry too much.
- It's not just about money.

01:06:42.388 --> 01:06:45.390
I knew Charlie was still friendly
with the resistance.

01:06:45.599 --> 01:06:47.976
But I didn't know how friendly.

01:07:13.419 --> 01:07:16.379
- He's expecting me.
- Let her through.

01:07:43.574 --> 01:07:47.410
Big Fatso!
How's the king of the underworld?

01:07:47.536 --> 01:07:49.454
Well, well, well...

01:07:49.747 --> 01:07:52.916
- If it isn't Barb the buxom.
- A gesture.

01:07:58.005 --> 01:08:02.175
Donuts! I thought
I'd be hearing from you real soon.

01:08:02.426 --> 01:08:05.929
- I have a proposition.
- Oh now, ain't that sweet?

01:08:06.263 --> 01:08:09.182
But you know
I only like big fat women.

01:08:16.482 --> 01:08:18.358
A business proposition.

01:08:19.109 --> 01:08:21.152
As in... lenses?

01:08:22.446 --> 01:08:26.407
Don't give me that surprised look like
you don't know what I'm talking about.

01:08:26.742 --> 01:08:30.662
You didn't drive to the evil empire
to see how my diet's going.

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:34.082
You came here to talk about
the contact lenses, didn't you?

01:08:34.416 --> 01:08:38.962
- I'm in a position to broker the sale.
- That's what I heard.

01:08:39.587 --> 01:08:42.966
I believe
you've already met... Mr. Schmitz.

01:08:45.261 --> 01:08:47.136
Never looked better.

01:08:47.763 --> 01:08:49.596
Let's make a deal.

01:09:12.997 --> 01:09:14.497
Spike?

01:09:18.127 --> 01:09:19.586
Anybody?

01:09:20.879 --> 01:09:23.214
It's Charlie, I'm here.

01:09:23.381 --> 01:09:26.593
- Spike ain't here.
- Well, where is she?

01:09:30.764 --> 01:09:33.515
She knows
I was supposed to meet her here.

01:09:33.642 --> 01:09:35.810
She sent me instead.

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:38.354
I talk to Spike or I talk to nobody!

01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:42.859
If the resistance wants to know where
those lenses are, you get me Spike!

01:09:43.068 --> 01:09:44.861
Coming right down.

01:10:09.511 --> 01:10:11.638
- Spike?
- Charlie Kopetski!

01:10:12.973 --> 01:10:14.057
Hold him!

01:10:14.433 --> 01:10:19.562
You're charged with concealing
information regarding contact lenses!

01:10:19.855 --> 01:10:23.191
You can cooperate and talk to me...

01:10:23.567 --> 01:10:25.068
or you can join your little friend.

01:10:25.402 --> 01:10:28.154
I'd rather join my friend!

01:10:30.866 --> 01:10:32.700
One million Canadian.

01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:34.994
- Deal!
- I'm not done yet!

01:10:35.704 --> 01:10:39.749
There's a plane I wanna catch at the
old airport by the unoccupied zone.

01:10:39.917 --> 01:10:41.793
Unoccupied zone...

01:10:42.836 --> 01:10:44.462
Bad part of town.

01:10:44.755 --> 01:10:48.091
I want save passage for me and Charlie
all the way through there.

01:10:48.258 --> 01:10:50.635
That means an escort
to the old airport.

01:10:50.969 --> 01:10:53.221
The zone can be very unpredictable,

01:10:53.389 --> 01:10:55.890
and
the toll collector's quite difficult.

01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:59.519
I'd have to stack
a few more men here and there...

01:10:59.812 --> 01:11:02.605
How about... half a mil Canadian?

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:04.565
750 upfront.

01:11:04.817 --> 01:11:07.276
Deal! You got the lenses?

01:11:08.821 --> 01:11:10.905
What do I look, new?

01:11:11.281 --> 01:11:15.702
We'll meet at the first toll entering
the zone an hour before sundown.

01:11:15.869 --> 01:11:18.162
Cash for the lenses, right there.

01:11:19.623 --> 01:11:22.375
You're five minutes late,
I'll sell to another buyer.

01:11:36.598 --> 01:11:39.392
The damn screen
is not picking up his thoughts!

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:42.603
Colonel,
he has no visual data for that period.

01:11:42.771 --> 01:11:45.440
Goddamn it! Where are the lenses?

01:11:46.608 --> 01:11:48.443
Speak now, man

01:11:48.569 --> 01:11:50.486
or suffer at your leisure.

01:11:51.155 --> 01:11:53.239
The Easter Bunny took them.

01:12:01.081 --> 01:12:02.665
I'll talk.

01:12:02.833 --> 01:12:04.375
I'll talk.

01:12:06.295 --> 01:12:08.629
- This guy has them.
- What guy?

01:12:09.339 --> 01:12:12.049
He's fat... wears a red suit...

01:12:13.177 --> 01:12:14.677
white beard.

01:12:14.803 --> 01:12:16.679
The name is Kringle.

01:12:18.932 --> 01:12:20.683
Kris Kringle.

01:12:25.564 --> 01:12:27.190
Merry Christmas!

01:13:01.099 --> 01:13:04.393
- What a mess!
- Well, this mess is all yours, Curly.

01:13:10.734 --> 01:13:12.235
The bar is yours.

01:13:13.403 --> 01:13:14.946
Get out!

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.866
I'm giving it to you.
Me and Charlie, we're history.

01:13:20.077 --> 01:13:21.953
What do you mean, "history"?

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:25.039
You're leaving forever?
You're not coming back?

01:13:28.544 --> 01:13:30.336
Look, Barb...

01:13:30.629 --> 01:13:33.381
I have no experience in running a bar.

01:13:33.549 --> 01:13:35.633
I'm just a waiter, for Christ's sake.

01:13:35.759 --> 01:13:37.760
Curly, relax, you're a natural.

01:13:40.556 --> 01:13:42.056
Camille!

01:13:50.566 --> 01:13:52.400
Well, this is it.

01:13:55.362 --> 01:13:57.071
I'm gonna miss you.

01:13:57.322 --> 01:13:59.574
I'm gonna miss you too, Curly.

01:14:00.576 --> 01:14:02.910
Now, take care of Camille, okay?

01:14:03.287 --> 01:14:04.954
Yeah, all right.

01:14:06.164 --> 01:14:10.793
I never thought I'd see the day you'd
drive away in that horrible thing.

01:14:10.961 --> 01:14:14.797
- Where's Charlie? He should be here.
- He went to see an old friend.

01:14:15.007 --> 01:14:18.050
- Someone named Spike.
- Spike?

01:14:19.636 --> 01:14:20.511
Get in!

01:14:46.622 --> 01:14:48.080
Oh god!

01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:56.881
Charlie!

01:15:16.818 --> 01:15:18.277
Oh my god!

01:15:22.115 --> 01:15:23.783
What happened?

01:15:23.951 --> 01:15:25.743
They're just kids.

01:15:28.205 --> 01:15:29.872
What's that?

01:15:49.184 --> 01:15:50.226
Charlie.

01:15:53.271 --> 01:15:56.440
We heard the Congressionals
discovered this place.

01:15:57.192 --> 01:16:01.487
- We were on our way to warn them.
- Yeah, well you were too late.

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.907
Listen to me, Barb, we need your help.

01:16:05.033 --> 01:16:08.744
There's no more time. The plane leaves
in 90 minutes. Only you can help us.

01:16:09.037 --> 01:16:10.579
Please.

01:16:14.334 --> 01:16:16.252
For Charlie.

01:16:20.048 --> 01:16:22.216
I'll take care of Charlie.

01:16:39.192 --> 01:16:40.568
Let's go.

01:17:08.138 --> 01:17:10.598
- What about the lenses?
- They're safe.

01:17:13.602 --> 01:17:17.646
She'll never be able to get on
that plane without the contact lenses.

01:17:17.814 --> 01:17:20.941
I said they're safe.
Are you coming or not?

01:17:30.202 --> 01:17:32.369
Does the word "overkill"
mean anything to you?

01:17:32.537 --> 01:17:34.997
- Ever driven out of Steel Harbor?
- No.

01:17:35.207 --> 01:17:36.874
Then shut up!

01:17:57.562 --> 01:18:00.523
- What's this?
- It's a road block.

01:18:00.690 --> 01:18:02.817
On the other side
is the unoccupied zone.

01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:04.944
There's a toll.

01:18:19.084 --> 01:18:21.836
- You two stay here.
- What's going on?

01:18:23.797 --> 01:18:26.090
This is our escort.

01:18:33.181 --> 01:18:35.349
Look at her, all gussied up.

01:18:36.226 --> 01:18:38.686
- Nice jewelry, Barb.
- Got the money?

01:18:39.062 --> 01:18:41.021
No chit-chat?

01:18:41.898 --> 01:18:43.607
Have it your way.

01:18:47.445 --> 01:18:50.906
- I said cash!
- Hey, I had to work fast.

01:18:51.199 --> 01:18:54.660
It's a gold debit card
with 750'000 credit on it.

01:18:54.953 --> 01:18:58.789
- It's as good as cash.
- That wasn't part of the deal, Fatso!

01:18:58.957 --> 01:19:01.584
I told you, I had to work fast.

01:19:01.793 --> 01:19:04.086
You got the lenses?

01:19:05.213 --> 01:19:06.422
Nice.

01:19:07.632 --> 01:19:10.050
- Watch them!
- What the hell you think you're doing?

01:19:10.385 --> 01:19:13.387
- Back off, Axel!
- Well, well, well...

01:19:13.597 --> 01:19:17.433
If it isn't Axel the freedom fighter
and the famous Cora D.

01:19:17.809 --> 01:19:21.020
We got ourselves the star-studded
gathering going on here.

01:19:21.313 --> 01:19:23.981
- How could you?
- How many times do I have to tell you?

01:19:24.107 --> 01:19:26.108
I don't take sides!

01:19:26.193 --> 01:19:29.069
I'm in this for me only.
Right, Big Fatso?

01:19:29.321 --> 01:19:31.947
Right,
and I like the way you think, Barb.

01:19:35.911 --> 01:19:37.453
The lenses!

01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:51.383
All right, phase two of the deal:

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:53.427
a safe escort to the old airport.

01:19:55.263 --> 01:19:57.223
Slight change of plans.

01:20:05.273 --> 01:20:07.107
You fat son of a bitch!

01:20:22.874 --> 01:20:24.667
Nice work, Mr. Big Fatso.

01:20:25.252 --> 01:20:27.127
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man!

01:20:28.546 --> 01:20:31.590
Barb, I'm gonna have to ask you
to drop your weapons.

01:20:35.095 --> 01:20:37.805
You'll love this, Barb.
Not only do I get the lenses,

01:20:38.139 --> 01:20:42.184
but I get a million dollars bounty on
your head and on the head of the doc

01:20:42.477 --> 01:20:44.561
for turning you both over
to the Congressionals.

01:20:44.938 --> 01:20:49.483
And not to mention the 750'000
dollar credit on the debit card.

01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:55.739
Don't you just love it
when a plan comes together?

01:21:01.329 --> 01:21:04.415
The face may deceive,
but the eyes never lie.

01:21:05.583 --> 01:21:07.793
Do they, doctor Devonshire?

01:21:08.837 --> 01:21:12.131
Washington has been
in such an uproar since you ran away.

01:21:12.257 --> 01:21:16.093
I can't tell you how eager we are
to have you back.

01:21:24.311 --> 01:21:25.352
Whore!

01:21:33.528 --> 01:21:36.405
Chief Willis, arrest these people!

01:21:41.453 --> 01:21:44.872
I want you to know I had nothing to do
with what happened to Charlie.

01:21:44.998 --> 01:21:46.665
And I'm sorry.

01:21:58.636 --> 01:22:01.138
- Don't move!
- Look out, she's got a grenade!

01:22:15.236 --> 01:22:17.112
Forward!

01:22:21.993 --> 01:22:23.327
Hang on!

01:22:25.330 --> 01:22:27.581
Jeez, we're gonna die!

01:22:36.424 --> 01:22:38.842
I'll kill you! I'll break you in half!

01:22:45.308 --> 01:22:47.184
How am I supposed to get on the plane?

01:22:47.435 --> 01:22:49.853
If we ever get out of this alive,
I'll kill you!

01:22:56.444 --> 01:22:58.112
- Axel, take the wheel!
- What?

01:22:58.446 --> 01:23:00.948
Don't argue, hurry!

01:23:05.829 --> 01:23:08.747
In an emergency
pull that yellow lever.

01:23:10.166 --> 01:23:12.418
How come I don't get to drive?

01:24:03.887 --> 01:24:05.721
Second toll, dead ahead!

01:24:06.389 --> 01:24:08.682
The airport's just beyond.

01:24:11.936 --> 01:24:13.812
<iconv() failed>

01:24:16.441 --> 01:24:19.276
- Does this constitute emergency?
- Yes!

01:24:29.621 --> 01:24:31.038
Oh shit!

01:24:32.415 --> 01:24:33.415
Hang on!

01:24:34.125 --> 01:24:35.709
Where are you going?

01:24:42.717 --> 01:24:44.051
Holy shit!

01:25:20.088 --> 01:25:21.129
Wait up!

01:26:05.508 --> 01:26:07.134
Give me your gun.

01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:09.511
Willis, get them to the airport,
quick! I'll stall them.

01:26:09.804 --> 01:26:12.431
- You can't.
- I'll meet you at the plane.

01:26:13.766 --> 01:26:15.017
Goodbye, Axel.

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:19.396
All right, let's go!

01:26:32.619 --> 01:26:35.704
Get going to the airport,
I'm going back. Move!

01:26:50.386 --> 01:26:51.928
There he is. Get him!

01:26:59.062 --> 01:27:00.437
He's over here!

01:27:05.485 --> 01:27:07.069
Follow him!

01:27:27.423 --> 01:27:29.257
Hold your fire!

01:27:55.326 --> 01:27:57.202
Where are you, bastard?

01:28:18.433 --> 01:28:19.516
Gosh!

01:29:30.213 --> 01:29:32.047
This one makes it go up and down?

01:29:32.423 --> 01:29:34.049
Yeah, it does.

01:29:34.217 --> 01:29:37.135
- Which one makes it go round?
- That one right here.

01:29:37.303 --> 01:29:38.887
How about this one?

01:29:56.739 --> 01:30:00.367
How touching,
the last stand of the desperate.

01:30:00.701 --> 01:30:03.119
Normally I don't get emotional
about my work.

01:30:03.287 --> 01:30:07.457
But vaporizing your springy ass
is gonna be a real pleasure.

01:31:03.931 --> 01:31:06.850
Oh Barb, we're so close.
Don't you feel the magic?

01:31:44.013 --> 01:31:47.015
This is just like my favorite song...

01:31:47.433 --> 01:31:50.560
- "I got you, babe!"
- Don't call me babe!

01:32:13.793 --> 01:32:15.710
Attention! Attention!

01:32:15.836 --> 01:32:19.839
Prepare for retinal scan
identification enforcement.

01:32:19.924 --> 01:32:23.802
Only U.N.
authorized and identified personnel

01:32:23.928 --> 01:32:26.304
will be permitted past this point

01:32:26.514 --> 01:32:29.224
but fractions
will be dealt with severely.

01:32:29.433 --> 01:32:31.685
Damn, Willis, we gotta do something.

01:32:31.852 --> 01:32:34.688
We'll create a flamboyant diversion.

01:32:34.855 --> 01:32:36.439
Thanks.

01:32:57.545 --> 01:32:59.337
There they are.

01:33:01.757 --> 01:33:03.967
Are we cutting it close enough?

01:33:13.561 --> 01:33:15.645
Put these in.

01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:18.940
Final seating flight 647.

01:33:19.066 --> 01:33:21.568
Destination Quebec, gate two.

01:33:22.653 --> 01:33:25.238
Hold that plane!

01:33:28.576 --> 01:33:29.909
Good luck, doc.

01:33:30.202 --> 01:33:31.911
Thank you.

01:33:35.207 --> 01:33:37.083
- Destination?
- Quebec.

01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:39.294
Step to the scanner.

01:33:49.263 --> 01:33:54.142
Retinal scan verified:
Citizen approved by all governments.

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:56.770
She's home free, mission completed.

01:33:57.605 --> 01:33:59.397
You're gonna miss your plane.

01:34:00.316 --> 01:34:02.525
I thought Barb Wire never took sides.

01:34:02.902 --> 01:34:04.486
Keep it to yourself!

01:34:04.653 --> 01:34:06.988
Last call, flight 647...

01:34:07.239 --> 01:34:09.074
Goodbye, Axel.

01:34:13.329 --> 01:34:14.370
Goodbye.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.626
Willis.

01:34:44.151 --> 01:34:46.027
Where will you go?

01:34:49.365 --> 01:34:52.075
I hear
Paris is nice this time of the year.

01:34:56.956 --> 01:35:00.375
I do believe I'm falling in love.

01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:03.042
Get in line!
