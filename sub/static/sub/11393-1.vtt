THIS IS THE FINEST HOTEL
IN THE ENTIRE CHAIN.

01:21:11.667 --> 01:21:13.136
YES, IT IS.

01:21:13.202 --> 01:21:15.638
THIS IS EVERYTHING I'VE
EVER DREAMED OF DOING,

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:17.073
AND NOW I'VE DONE IT.

01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:19.542
I THINK
I'D LIKE A POSITION...

01:21:22.078 --> 01:21:24.680
THAT'S A LITTLE LESS
DEMANDING ON MY TIME.

01:21:24.747 --> 01:21:26.916
HMM.

01:21:28.684 --> 01:21:30.853
LET ME SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:34.590
MR. DUBROW, YOU KNOW
LOTS OF PEOPLE, RIGHT?

01:21:34.657 --> 01:21:35.891
WHY DO YOU ASK?

01:21:35.959 --> 01:21:37.360
I HAVE THIS FRIEND

01:21:37.426 --> 01:21:40.596
WHO'S SORT OF IN NEED
OF A FAVOR.

01:21:40.663 --> 01:21:42.165
UH-HUH.

01:21:58.814 --> 01:22:00.516
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

01:22:03.086 --> 01:22:04.587
LIONEL SPALDING...

01:22:04.653 --> 01:22:05.921
AND NEIL.

01:22:05.989 --> 01:22:08.291
WELCOME TO
THE BALI MAJESTIC,
MR. SPALDING.

01:22:08.357 --> 01:22:10.193
THE MANAGER HAS BEEN
EXPECTING YOU.

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:13.129
MR. SPALDING,
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW PLEASED I AM

01:22:13.196 --> 01:22:15.598
THAT YOU DECIDED TO
ACCEPT OUR INVITATION,

01:22:15.664 --> 01:22:17.633
PARTICULARLY AFTER
THOSE RATHER UNFORTUNATE
CIRCUMSTANCES

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:18.934
BACK IN NEW YORK.

01:22:19.002 --> 01:22:20.469
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE,

01:22:20.536 --> 01:22:22.771
WE ARE FAR, FAR AWAY
FROM THERE RIGHT NOW.

01:22:22.838 --> 01:22:25.074
AND MY FAMILY AND I
ARE DEDICATED

01:22:25.141 --> 01:22:28.544
TO MAKING YOUR STAY HERE
AT THE BALI MAJESTIC

01:22:28.611 --> 01:22:31.080
AS UNEVENTFUL
AND TROUBLE-FREE
AS IS HUMANLY POSSIBLE.

01:22:31.147 --> 01:22:32.948
YOUR ROOM AND MEALS
ARE COMPLIMENTARY.

01:22:33.016 --> 01:22:37.020
IF YOU'D LIKE ME TO
ARRANGE A LINE OF CREDIT
IN THE CASINO,

01:22:37.086 --> 01:22:38.454
I'D BE HAPPY TO DO SO.

01:22:38.521 --> 01:22:41.157
YOU MAY HEAR SOME
OF OUR NATIVE ISLANDERS

01:22:41.224 --> 01:22:42.458
OUT AND AROUND
THE BUSHES.

01:22:42.525 --> 01:22:44.027
THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

01:22:44.093 --> 01:22:45.528
I CAN GUARANTEE YOU

01:22:45.594 --> 01:22:49.098
THERE WILL BE
NO FURTHER INCIDENTS
TO DEAL WITH.

01:22:49.165 --> 01:22:51.600
ANYTIME
YOU NEED ANYTHING,
PICK UP THE PHONE--

01:22:51.667 --> 01:22:52.635
DAD, UH--

01:22:52.701 --> 01:22:54.170
JUST A MOMENT, KYLE.

01:22:54.237 --> 01:22:56.639
