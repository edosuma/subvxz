WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:02.303
Hey, have they left
for the big meeting yet?

00:02.336 --> 00:03.437
I got Michael's lucky tie.

00:03.471 --> 00:05.639
No, they're in
the conference room.

00:05.673 --> 00:07.341
Okay.

00:07.375 --> 00:08.576
Wait, are those
Michael's Levis?

00:08.609 --> 00:10.611
Yeah.
Who dry

00:10.644 --> 00:13.081
Michael and his jeans.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.782
He gets in them and...

00:14.815 --> 00:16.450
I'm not exactly sure
what happens,

00:16.484 --> 00:20.121
but I can tell you,
he loves the way he looks

00:20.154 --> 00:21.655
in those jeans.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.558
I know that's why
he started casual Fridays.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.094
I'll take those.

00:26.127 --> 00:30.064
Thanks.

01:04.465 --> 01:07.535
This is a projection
of the county's needs.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.504
Wow, graphs and charts.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.473
Somebody's really
been doing their homework.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.475
Looks like USA Today.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.510
13 schools, 2 hospitals...

01:16.544 --> 01:18.612
So this possible client
they're talking about.

01:18.646 --> 01:19.780
Actually, a big deal.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.582
It's Lackawanna County.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.517
Our whole county.

01:23.551 --> 01:24.785
And if we get this,

01:24.818 --> 01:28.689
they might not have
to downsize our branch.

01:28.722 --> 01:32.626
And I could work here
for years.

01:32.660 --> 01:37.265
And years and...years.

01:37.298 --> 01:39.533
So, when we get
to the Radisson, I'd like to--

01:39.567 --> 01:42.403
Oh, I changed it to Chili's.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.437
Excuse me?

01:43.471 --> 01:45.873
Radisson just gives out
this vibe.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.775
It's like, "Oh, I'm doing
business at the Radisson."

01:47.808 --> 01:50.444
It's kinda snooty, so...

01:50.478 --> 01:51.612
You had no right
to do that, Michael.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.447
Here's the thing, Chili's...

01:53.481 --> 01:55.749
is the new golf course.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.551
It's where business happens.

01:57.585 --> 02:00.654
Small Businessman Magazine.

02:00.688 --> 02:01.722
It said that.

02:01.755 --> 02:02.890
It will.
I sent it in.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.225
Letter to the editor.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.361
All right.

02:07.395 --> 02:09.663
But you will let me
run this meeting.

02:09.697 --> 02:10.664
Mmmm.
Mm-hmm.

02:10.698 --> 02:11.665
Mm-hmm.
Powertrip.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.367
What?

02:13.401 --> 02:15.603
She had done
a background check on me.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.205
She had it printed out.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.472
No.
Yeah.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.508
And she was asking
me about stuff line by line

02:20.541 --> 02:21.609
while we were having dinner.

02:21.642 --> 02:22.843
That is unbelievable.

02:22.876 --> 02:23.844
What's going on?

02:23.877 --> 02:26.314
We are doing
worst first dates.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.915
Oh, my God.
I win.

02:27.948 --> 02:30.484
Okay, it was a minor league
hockey game.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.386
He brought his brother.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.621
And when I went
to the bathroom,

02:33.654 --> 02:35.356
the game ended,
and they forgot about me.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.424
Okay, that's a joke.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.559
No, they had
to come back for me.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.628
Wait, when was this?

02:40.661 --> 02:44.332
Um...

02:44.365 --> 02:46.300
It was not that long ago.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.501
Wait, not Roy.

02:47.535 --> 02:49.837
Say it's not your fiance.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.742
I always knew Pam
has refused to go

02:54.775 --> 02:56.544
to sports games with Roy.

02:56.577 --> 02:59.913
But I never knew why.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.615
Interesting.

03:01.649 --> 03:04.285
Okay, let's do this thing.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.486
Wish us luck.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.920
Good luck, Michael.
Good luck, Jan.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.322
Thank you.
Kiss ass.

03:08.356 --> 03:11.559
Okay, probably going
to go late tonight.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.427
Burning the midnight tequila.

03:13.461 --> 03:15.763
So I think you all
could just take off now.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.631
Michael, this shouldn't
take more than an hour.

03:17.665 --> 03:18.799
Well...

03:18.832 --> 03:20.401
Do you always shut down
the entire office

03:20.434 --> 03:22.336
when you leave
for an hour?

03:22.370 --> 03:23.371
No, no.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.972
That would not be efficient.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.907
Actually, they just don't get
very much work done

03:26.940 --> 03:27.941
when I'm not here.

03:30.378 --> 03:33.347
That's not true.
I know how to delegate.

03:33.381 --> 03:36.350
And they do more work
when I'm not here.

03:36.384 --> 03:39.287
Not more...
the same amount of work...

03:39.320 --> 03:41.322
is done whether I am here
or not.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.592
Hey, everybody, listen up!

03:44.625 --> 03:45.893
This is what
we're gonna do.

03:45.926 --> 03:49.430
You sit tight until
I return, sound good?

03:49.463 --> 03:52.333
Doesn't matter.
It's an order.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.001
Follow it blindly.
Mm-ha-ha!

03:54.034 --> 03:56.470
Okay?

03:56.504 --> 03:58.372
All right, chow.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.474
Adios!

04:00.508 --> 04:02.443
So which way is Chili's?

04:02.476 --> 04:04.378
Ah, I'll drive.
No, that's all right.

04:04.412 --> 04:05.413
I wanna leave
straight from there.

04:05.446 --> 04:06.414
It just a couple
blocks away.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.482
So--boy, you really
don't know Scranton, do you?

04:08.516 --> 04:10.384
I know Scranton.
At all.

04:10.418 --> 04:11.919
Have you ever been
to Scranton, Jen?

04:11.952 --> 04:14.688
If it's a couple blocks away,
we can go together.

04:14.722 --> 04:17.625
Jan Levinson-Gould.

04:17.658 --> 04:18.992
Jan is cold.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.628
If she was sitting
across from you on a train,

04:20.661 --> 04:22.730
and she wasn't moving,
you might think she was dead.

04:22.763 --> 04:26.500
We should come up with
a signal of some sort.

04:26.534 --> 04:27.635
Why would we need
a signal?

04:27.668 --> 04:29.437
Well, in case one of us
gets into trouble,

04:29.470 --> 04:30.738
the other one
can signal and...

04:30.771 --> 04:32.039
What kind of trouble are you
planning on

04:32.072 --> 04:33.574
getting in, Michael?

04:33.607 --> 04:34.808
Well, it could be
either of us.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.310
You're gonna let me
do the talking,

04:36.344 --> 04:37.578
we agreed on that.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.447
Yes.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.984
Hello?
Christian?

04:44.017 --> 04:45.519
Yes.
I thought that was you.

04:45.553 --> 04:46.487
Hi.
Hi.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.389
Michael Scott,
this is Jan Levinson-Gould.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.057
Just Jan Levinson.

04:50.090 --> 04:50.958
No Gould?
No.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.826
Thank you very much
for meeting with us.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.328
Have you been
waiting long?

04:54.362 --> 04:55.363
No, not long.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.730
Good.
Uh, Jan, what happened?

04:56.764 --> 04:58.532
Michael...
Is Gould dead?

04:58.566 --> 05:00.601
What, uh...
Michael.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.635
We got divorced, okay?

05:01.669 --> 05:03.804
I'm so sorry, excuse me.
Wow, you're kidding me.

05:03.837 --> 05:04.872
Do you wanna talk about it?

05:04.905 --> 05:06.106
Michael.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.641
Could we have
a table for three please?

05:07.675 --> 05:09.042
When did this happen?

05:09.076 --> 05:10.511
We're in a meeting.
Okay.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.512
This way, please.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.713
All right, after you.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.582
Thank you.

05:18.552 --> 05:19.987
I thought we could start

05:20.020 --> 05:21.655
by going over
the needs of the county.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.023
Right.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.359
Well, Lackawanna County
has not been immune

05:25.393 --> 05:29.129
to the slow economic growth
of the past five years.

05:29.162 --> 05:32.700
So for us, the name of the game
is budget reduction.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.602
Awesome Blossom?

05:34.635 --> 05:36.370
What?

05:36.404 --> 05:37.471
I think we should share
an Awesome Blossom.

05:37.505 --> 05:38.806
What do you say?
They are awesome.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.774
You want to, Christian?
Awesome?

05:40.808 --> 05:42.976
Sure.
Okay, it's done.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.946
Actually, Megan, may we have
an Awesome Blossom, please?

05:45.979 --> 05:47.581
Extra awesome?

05:47.615 --> 05:48.649
Now it is done.

05:48.682 --> 05:49.483
So, if you have--

05:49.517 --> 05:51.952
Hey, I heard a very very
funny joke...

05:51.985 --> 05:53.654
the other day.
You wanna hear it?

05:53.687 --> 05:56.657
Christian, you don't
have to listen to this.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.426
It's okay.
I like jokes.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.527
Okay.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.494
Just the one.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.530
Just one joke?
Okay.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.064
Well, if it's just
gonna be one...

06:04.097 --> 06:07.468
I will think of
a different joke.

06:07.501 --> 06:10.137
Um...

06:11.439 --> 06:12.806
Dunder Miflin,
this is Pam.

06:12.840 --> 06:13.874
Pam, it's Michael.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.643
I need you to go
into my office

06:15.676 --> 06:16.944
and check some data for me.

06:16.977 --> 06:20.113
Okay, um, you want me
to read 'em?

06:20.147 --> 06:21.181
Yes.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.851
Okay, um, a fisherman
is walking down 5th Avenue

06:23.884 --> 06:25.519
leading an animal
behind him.

06:25.553 --> 06:26.820
Nope!
Nope, hold it.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.456
Not as good as you think.
Pick another one.

06:28.489 --> 06:29.457
Okay.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.492
There's a transcript
between a Naval ship and...

06:31.525 --> 06:33.694
Oh, hey!
Bingo.

06:33.727 --> 06:34.762
And a lighthouse.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.096
Yes, that is hysterical.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.498
Could you start that one
from the beginning?

06:37.531 --> 06:38.832
Sure.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.200
There's a transcript
between a naval ship

06:40.233 --> 06:41.435
and a lighthouse.

07:00.654 --> 07:01.622
Is this real?

07:01.655 --> 07:05.058
It is a screenplay...

07:05.092 --> 07:06.226
starring himself.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.161
Agent Michael Scarn.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.763
Of the F.B.I.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.198
How long is this?

07:11.231 --> 07:15.469
Oh, Pam, good work.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.237
Oh, wait, stop.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.572
Drawings.

07:18.606 --> 07:19.607
What is that?

07:19.640 --> 07:22.175
Oh, those are drawings
in case

07:22.209 --> 07:24.712
the writing didn't really
put a picture in your head.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.580
And there he is in the flesh,

07:26.614 --> 07:28.649
Agent Michael Scarn.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.183
Now we know
what he looks like.

07:30.217 --> 07:33.253
First guy says,
"Well, I'm an astronaut,

07:33.286 --> 07:34.855
so I drive a Saturn."

07:34.888 --> 07:37.725
And the second guy says,
"Well, I am a pimp,

07:37.758 --> 07:40.193
so I drive a cheap Escort."

07:40.227 --> 07:42.029
And the third guy says,
"I got you both beat.

07:42.062 --> 07:46.934
I'm a proctologist
so I drive a brown Probe."

07:46.967 --> 07:49.637
Oh, no!

07:51.605 --> 07:53.774
Oh, my God,
that's funny!

07:53.807 --> 07:56.577
I almost had Awesome Blossom
coming out of my nose!

07:58.145 --> 07:59.847
Excuse me, could I have
a vodka tonic, please?

07:59.880 --> 08:02.550
Do we all have our copy
of Threat Level Midnight

08:02.583 --> 08:03.684
by Michael Scott?

08:05.018 --> 08:06.954
All right,
let's get this started.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.990
I'm gonna be reading
the action descriptions.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.892
And Phyllis, I would
like you to play

08:11.925 --> 08:13.160
Catherine Zeta-Jones.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.261
That's the character's name?

08:14.294 --> 08:16.664
Okay, you guys should not
be doing this!

08:16.697 --> 08:17.898
Why not, Dwight?

08:17.931 --> 08:19.199
This is a movie.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.769
I mean, this is for all
of America to enjoy.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.937
You took something
that doesn't belong to you.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.238
Dwight.
Brought it in here,
made copies of it...

08:25.272 --> 08:28.241
Do you want to play
the lead role

08:28.275 --> 08:29.543
of Agent Michael Scarn?

08:31.745 --> 08:33.246
Arrgh!
Num num num.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.982
That's delicious!

08:35.015 --> 08:36.283
I love it.

08:36.316 --> 08:39.152
We would probably
be upset with ourselves

08:39.186 --> 08:41.989
if we went this whole night
without talking business.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.958
So Dunder Miflin can provide...

08:44.992 --> 08:47.595
a level of personal service
to the county

08:47.628 --> 08:50.263
that suppliers like Staples
can't match.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.265
Well, we are out
to save money.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.266
What's the bottom line?

08:53.300 --> 08:54.267
Blah!
Blah blah blah.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.036
Blu bad be bah.

08:56.069 --> 09:00.307
That's why I wanted
a signal between us.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.943
So I wouldn't have
to just shout nonsense words.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.344
That's her fault.

09:04.377 --> 09:09.216
Did somebody say
babyback ribs?

09:09.249 --> 09:11.251
Hmm?
Hmm?

09:11.284 --> 09:14.221
I don't think Christian
has time for that, Michael.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.056
I have time.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.358
* I want my babyback
babyback babyback *

09:18.391 --> 09:20.260
* I want my babyback
babyback babyback *

09:20.293 --> 09:21.862
* I want my babyback
babyback babyback *

09:21.895 --> 09:24.665
* Chili's babyback ribs

09:24.698 --> 09:27.100
Inside the F.B.I.,
Agent Michael Scarn

09:27.134 --> 09:28.702
sits with his feet
up on his desk.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.671
Catherine Zeta-Jones enters.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.372
Sir, you have
some messages.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.808
Not now!
They're important.

09:34.842 --> 09:37.144
Okay, what are they?

09:37.177 --> 09:39.179
The first message is...
I love you.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.681
That's from me.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.315
Not in 1,000 years,
Catherine.

09:42.349 --> 09:43.183
We work together.

09:43.216 --> 09:45.052
And get off my desk.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.054
Yes, I have acted before.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.957
I was in a production of
Oklahoma in the seventh grade.

09:49.990 --> 09:53.727
I played the part
of Mutie the mailman.

09:53.761 --> 09:55.162
They had too many kids,

09:55.195 --> 09:57.931
so they make up roles
like that.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.099
I was good.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.801
If it isn't
my old partner,

10:00.834 --> 10:03.203
Samuel L. Chang.

10:03.236 --> 10:06.640
Agent Michael Scarn,
you lost some weight.

10:06.674 --> 10:09.877
Thank you for noticing.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.112
Now, keep me company
for one more mission.

10:12.145 --> 10:16.116
Hey, I have
to work late.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.985
You're joking, right?

10:18.018 --> 10:19.186
Michael Scarn takes out
a nine millimeter gun

10:19.219 --> 10:21.254
and shoots the cake
to bits.

10:23.023 --> 10:26.259
Ha ha ha, Agent Michael Scarn,
you so funny.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.762
Word.

10:28.796 --> 10:29.830
Michael's movie?

10:29.863 --> 10:31.865
Two thumbs down.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.941
A man sitting
several seats down

10:40.974 --> 10:43.744
who has a gold face
turns to Michael Scarn.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.412
Uh, ooh.

10:45.445 --> 10:48.782
Oscar, you wanna play
Goldenface?

10:48.816 --> 10:51.018
Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would
be comfortable

10:51.051 --> 10:52.119
in my private jet.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.421
Yes, perhaps I would,
Goldenface.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.089
Sam, get my luggage.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.025
I forget it, brotha.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.760
Samuel, you are such
an idiot!

10:59.793 --> 11:01.294
You are the worst
assistant ever.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.930
And you're disgusting,
Dwigt.

11:02.963 --> 11:05.799
Wait, who's Dwigt?

11:05.833 --> 11:08.702
Here's what
we think happened.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.704
Michael's sidekick,
who all through the movie

11:10.738 --> 11:13.306
is this complete idiot
who's causing the downfall

11:13.340 --> 11:15.709
of the United States...

11:15.743 --> 11:17.711
was originally named Dwight.

11:17.745 --> 11:20.447
But then Michael changed it
to Samuel L. Chang

11:20.480 --> 11:22.482
using a search and replace.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.451
But that doesn't work
on misspelled words.

11:24.484 --> 11:27.287
Leaving behind one Dwigt.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.790
And Dwight
figured it out.

11:29.823 --> 11:30.824
Oops.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.827
D.W.I.G.H.T.

11:33.861 --> 11:34.828
Okay, you know what?

11:34.862 --> 11:36.029
I am done with this.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.497
That's it, the end.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.267
Well, some of us
wanna keep reading, so...

11:40.300 --> 11:42.235
Uh, you don't speak
for everyone, Jim.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.037
Okay, announcement.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.206
My uncle bought me
some fireworks.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.375
And anyone who wants
to see a real show

11:48.408 --> 11:50.077
come with me outside now.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.112
That's actually a good idea.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.213
We'll all take
a brief intermission.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.248
Hey, are you hungry?

11:55.282 --> 11:56.884
Yeah.
Yeah?

11:56.917 --> 12:00.220
And so after watching my mom
go through so much pain,

12:00.253 --> 12:03.356
I decided to keep that promise
that I made to her.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.492
And take care of her.

12:05.525 --> 12:06.994
Hoo.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.896
Well, this brings us to Jan.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.063
Truth or dare.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.498
Tell us about your divorce.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.133
Oh, no, Michael.
Michael, Michael.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.435
Do, do.
Michael, please.
No really.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.137
Oh, hey.
So you're not gonna play.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.506
She's not playing.
She's not playing the game.
That's not fair.

12:19.539 --> 12:20.841
We'd been fighting
for a while.

12:20.874 --> 12:21.942
He didn't want kids.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.010
I knew that
going into it.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.411
But he also knew that I did.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.246
So I guess I thought
that he would change his mind.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.815
He thought that I
would change mine.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.482
You didn't.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.952
I was stupid.

12:31.985 --> 12:35.789
No.
No, you were not stupid.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.024
Gould was stupid, right?

12:37.057 --> 12:38.058
That's right.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.060
You were really brave.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.262
I mean, you put
your arms out there.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.264
You slit your wrist.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.466
You said, "World, this is
my blood, it's red.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.903
Just like yours,
so love me."

12:49.937 --> 12:53.406
I had plans
to meet a friend tonight.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.908
Which I had to cancel.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.409
But this is cool too.

12:56.443 --> 13:00.180
I'm not a complainer.

13:03.483 --> 13:06.153
Wow.
For the bugs.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.254
Nice.

13:07.287 --> 13:11.258
That's excellent
because bugs love...

13:11.291 --> 13:12.425
my famous grilled cheese
sandwich.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.462
Yes!
Nice.

13:15.495 --> 13:19.699
I can't remember the last time
someone made me dinner.

13:23.570 --> 13:24.604
Whoa!

13:24.637 --> 13:27.140
Yeah!
Whoo! Whoo!

13:29.242 --> 13:32.079
Yeah!
Ha!

13:32.112 --> 13:33.080
Whoo-hoo!

13:33.113 --> 13:35.448
Right down the street?
Mm-hmm.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.284
Kenneth Road,
born and raised.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.451
Spent my whole life

13:38.485 --> 13:40.287
right here
in Lackawanna county.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.522
And I do not intend
on moving.

13:42.555 --> 13:43.957
I know this place.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.592
I know how many
hospitals we have.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.361
I know how many
schools we have.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.496
It's home, you know?

13:49.529 --> 13:51.264
I know the challenges

13:51.298 --> 13:53.100
that this county's
up against.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.135
Here's the thing about
those discount suppliers,

13:55.168 --> 13:56.069
they don't care.

13:56.103 --> 13:59.006
They come in,
they undercut everything.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.640
And they run us
out of business.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.010
And then,
once we're all gone,

14:03.043 --> 14:04.377
they jack up the prices.
I know.

14:04.411 --> 14:05.512
It's bad.
It's terrible.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.115
It is
It really is.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.516
Uh...

14:09.549 --> 14:11.484
I don't know.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.954
I guess I could give you guys
our business,

14:13.987 --> 14:15.488
but you have
to meet me halfway, okay?

14:15.522 --> 14:18.558
Because they're expecting me
to make cuts.

14:18.591 --> 14:22.262
Well, corporate's gonna
go ballistic,

14:22.295 --> 14:26.499
but you think we could, Jan?

14:26.533 --> 14:30.403
So, I guess
I'll see you in...

14:30.437 --> 14:31.571
10 hours.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.473
What are you gonna do
with your time off?

14:33.506 --> 14:35.108
Travel.
Yeah.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.610
I've been
looking forward to it.

14:37.644 --> 14:41.314
It's gonna be...
really nice.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.516
I'm gonna find myself.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.918
You have new music?

14:44.952 --> 14:49.456
Yeah.
Definitely.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.133
See ya!
Bye!

15:00.167 --> 15:02.435
Good-bye!

15:02.469 --> 15:05.405
Thanks.

15:05.438 --> 15:06.539
Yes!
We did it.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.441
We got it!
Nailed it, nailed it!

15:08.475 --> 15:11.311
Come here.

15:11.344 --> 15:14.647
I am really...thrilled.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.463
Let's go.

15:30.497 --> 15:31.664
What?
Let's go.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.666
Go and--okay.
Where are we going?

15:33.700 --> 15:35.235
Doesn't matter.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.570
Goin' to the go-go.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.240
Okay.

15:50.217 --> 15:54.221
Michael?

16:00.193 --> 16:03.463
Michael?

16:04.797 --> 16:08.968
Michael?

16:12.172 --> 16:14.407
His car's not
in the parking lot.

16:14.441 --> 16:17.410
I should check
the accident reports.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.349
Who's this?

16:22.382 --> 16:23.983
Jan?

16:43.403 --> 16:45.405
Morning, Pam.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.541
Hey.

16:48.575 --> 16:52.679
No, nothing happened.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.082
I swear!

16:55.115 --> 16:56.583
Nothing happened.

16:56.616 --> 17:00.787
What--I'm totally
being serious.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.823
A gentleman does not
kiss and tell.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.559
And neither do I.

17:06.593 --> 17:07.660
I'm...

17:07.694 --> 17:09.629
No, seriously, guys,
I'm not...

17:09.662 --> 17:12.399
I don't wanna
go into it at all.

17:12.432 --> 17:15.802
It's off limits.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.337
Fine, I took her back
to her hotel,

17:17.370 --> 17:18.838
and we made out
for a little while.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.373
It was great.

17:20.407 --> 17:21.674
I mean, she told me
about her divorce.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.809
We talked
for about five hours.

17:22.842 --> 17:25.278
She fell asleep on my arm.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.119
Hello, Dwight.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.120
Did you do her?

17:33.153 --> 17:34.787
Who?

17:34.821 --> 17:36.856
Jan Levinson-Gould.

17:36.889 --> 17:41.128
Uh, no, no, no Gould.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.095
Did you do her?

17:42.129 --> 17:44.131
This is none
of your affair.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.298
Because she is your boss.

17:45.332 --> 17:46.299
And she is your boss.

17:46.333 --> 17:47.867
And she is a woman.

17:47.900 --> 17:53.873
She is a strong, soft,
thoughtful, sexy woman.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.375
And you know what?

17:55.408 --> 17:56.609
I don't think
I can sit here

17:56.643 --> 17:58.745
and let you
talk about her that way

17:58.778 --> 18:00.713
without me
defending her honor.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.116
Jan, I defend your honor.

18:03.150 --> 18:03.816
Is that all?

18:09.489 --> 18:11.891
Jan didn't come back
for her car last night.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.860
What?

18:13.893 --> 18:16.363
Could it be
that Agent Michael Scarn

18:16.396 --> 18:18.165
has finally found
his Catherine Zeta?

18:18.198 --> 18:20.333
Oh, I don't know...

18:22.169 --> 18:24.271
Oh, my God.
This is Jan's cell.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.372
No way.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.608
Dunder Miflin,
this is Pam.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.278
I know we have
to register

18:31.311 --> 18:34.214
as a consensual
sexual relationship with HR.

18:34.247 --> 18:37.750
My question, do I do it
as the man,

18:37.784 --> 18:39.386
does she do it
as my superior?

18:39.419 --> 18:40.820
I don't know.

18:40.853 --> 18:43.156
That leads to other issues
that we may have

18:43.190 --> 18:45.225
in our relationship.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.226
It's, uh...

18:46.259 --> 18:47.694
Excuse me.

18:47.727 --> 18:48.928
Hello?

18:48.961 --> 18:51.898
Hi.
Just talking about you.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.833
The camera.
No.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.668
Uh-huh.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.337
How's traffic?

18:57.370 --> 18:59.906
I miss you.
What?

18:59.939 --> 19:03.176
Okay.

19:03.210 --> 19:09.916
Well, if it was a mistake,
it was a wonderful mistake.

19:09.949 --> 19:13.553
No.
Just...

19:13.586 --> 19:18.791
No, I did not intentionally
get you drunk.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.593
Mm-hmm.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.229
No, no.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.863
This is just a fight.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.598
This is just a first fight
of many fights

19:25.632 --> 19:28.201
we're gonna have.

19:28.235 --> 19:30.737
Right.

19:30.770 --> 19:31.771
No.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.473
You--I don't understand.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.375
You wanna see
other people.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.809
Only other people.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.578
Wha--okay.

19:38.611 --> 19:39.946
I think you're still
a little bit drunk.

19:39.979 --> 19:42.815
Excuse me.
Excuse me?

19:42.849 --> 19:44.884
I think you're sti--yes.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.453
Why don't you just
come back here?

19:46.486 --> 19:47.854
We can go to the hotel.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.389
Have a few drinks.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.391
No, I didn't
slip you something!

19:51.424 --> 19:54.427
Some might even say we had
our first date last night.

19:54.461 --> 19:56.629
Oh, really?
Really.

19:56.663 --> 19:57.864
Why might some say that?

19:57.897 --> 20:01.934
'Cause there was dinner.
By candlelight.

20:01.968 --> 20:05.338
Dinner and a show
if you include Michael's movie.

20:05.372 --> 20:08.808
And there was
dancing and fireworks.

20:08.841 --> 20:09.809
Pretty good date.

20:09.842 --> 20:12.512
We didn't dance.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.546
You're right,
we didn't dance.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.883
It was more like...swaying.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.351
But still romantic.

20:18.385 --> 20:19.952
Swaying isn't dancing.

20:22.054 --> 20:25.692
At least I didn't leave you
at a high school hockey game.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.799
I have some faxes
to get out.

20:35.402 --> 20:38.305
Oh, come on.
Pam, I'm...

20:38.338 --> 20:40.039
Okay, we didn't dance.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.742
And I was totally joking,
anyway.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.777
I mean, it's not really
a date if the girl

20:44.811 --> 20:47.914
goes home to her fiance.

20:47.947 --> 20:48.915
Right?

20:50.717 --> 20:52.719
