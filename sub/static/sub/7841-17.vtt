01:22.063 --> 01:23.518
Hey, hey, kids!

01:23.519 --> 01:26.559
It's a beautiful,
sunny Saturday morning.

01:26.560 --> 01:29.767
So get ready for six hours
of cartoons!

01:31.285 --> 01:34.782
Today's Krusty's Korean
Kartoon Kavalcade starts

01:34.783 --> 01:39.355
with an exciting adventure
of "The Trans-Clown-O-Morphs."

01:41.324 --> 01:44.126
Trans-Clown-O-Morphs
Transforming clowns

01:44.127 --> 01:46.350
that morph
Sent to Earth to defeat

01:46.351 --> 01:48.631
the evil Dino-Robo-Bots

01:51.630 --> 01:56.025
Trans-Clown-O-Morphs
Transforming clowns that morph

01:56.568 --> 02:00.634
And their human friend
is you.

02:04.577 --> 02:06.624
Back off,
Pterodactyl-bots.

02:06.625 --> 02:08.592
You'll never conquer
Big Top City.

02:08.592 --> 02:10.470
Oh, really?

02:10.471 --> 02:14.564
It's time to make you
Trans-Clown-O-Morphs extinct.

02:16.897 --> 02:19.733
Only my Saturday morning viewers
can save me!

02:20.266 --> 02:22.745
Buy my cereal,
find the secret code inside

02:22.746 --> 02:25.265
and text me the message
"start the day with Kellogg's"

02:25.266 --> 02:27.774
- or I will die.
- Enough from you!

02:29.490 --> 02:30.678
Hurry!

02:30.901 --> 02:33.070
Guess no one's buying my cereal.

02:33.684 --> 02:35.496
Buy or I'll die.

02:35.858 --> 02:38.515
Mom, we need to throw out
all this Krusty cereal

02:38.516 --> 02:40.197
and get Robot Clown cereal!

02:40.198 --> 02:42.038
Every week we have
to buy something else

02:42.039 --> 02:44.620
to save that transforming
clown that morphs.

02:44.621 --> 02:48.414
I want you to watch a show
that isn't just one long commercial.

02:49.530 --> 02:51.917
Justin Leonard lines up the putt.

02:51.918 --> 02:55.579
This is for par and a share
of sixth place.

02:57.113 --> 02:59.674
Mom, we need
a Callaway titanium

02:59.675 --> 03:03.038
- perimeter-weighted driver!
- It adds yards to any swing.

03:03.444 --> 03:07.238
You two have been bombarded
with enough commercial images.

03:07.239 --> 03:10.659
Lisa, I've got a big bunch
of black banas.

03:10.660 --> 03:12.339
You know what that means.

03:12.340 --> 03:14.021
Bana bread!

03:15.715 --> 03:18.337
And Bart, you go with your
father to Shelbyville

03:18.338 --> 03:20.438
to get the beanbag chairs
re-beaned.

03:20.439 --> 03:22.852
Oh, no, I hate
the beanbag store.

03:22.853 --> 03:25.787
The clerks are always shouting
in Hebrew on their cell phones.

03:27.825 --> 03:30.879
So Dean Martin would
show up at the last minute

03:30.880 --> 03:33.177
and do everything
in just one take?

03:33.178 --> 03:35.059
- That's right.
- But Wikipedia said

03:35.060 --> 03:36.741
he was "passionate about rehearsal."

03:36.742 --> 03:38.643
Don't you worry about Wikipedia.

03:38.644 --> 03:40.589
We'll change it
when we get home.

03:40.590 --> 03:43.128
We'll change a lot of things.

03:43.636 --> 03:44.988
Hey, check it out!

03:44.989 --> 03:48.033
I wouldn't mind driving that
over a prairie dog village.

03:48.034 --> 03:49.344
Honk to the driver!

03:52.510 --> 03:53.731
Martin?!

03:53.732 --> 03:56.147
What's a tool like you
doing on something cool like that?

03:56.148 --> 03:57.788
Yeah, what's
the deal, loser?

03:57.789 --> 04:00.064
I'm operating
a Combine Harvester.

04:00.065 --> 04:02.742
It's part of my duties
as a member of 4-H.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.691
4- H Club? Is it dangerous?

04:04.692 --> 04:07.237
Indeed, it has
the most finger loss

04:07.238 --> 04:09.377
of any youth organization.

04:09.378 --> 04:11.015
Can I join, Dad?
Can I? Can I? Can I?

04:11.016 --> 04:13.452
Son, a lot of these
youth organizations

04:13.453 --> 04:16.286
encourage parents to get
involved in the activities.

04:16.288 --> 04:17.923
- Not this one.
- Sold!

04:23.842 --> 04:26.349
"I pledge my head
to clearer thinking,

04:26.350 --> 04:29.125
"my heart to greater loyalty,
my hands.."

04:29.126 --> 04:31.209
oh, man, how many
"H's" does this thing have?

04:31.210 --> 04:32.516
Yeah, there's a bunch.

04:32.517 --> 04:35.372
Let's skip the oath and, uh,
get you behind the wheel

04:35.373 --> 04:36.902
of something you can't handle.

05:14.429 --> 05:17.102
Raise articulator,
set hydraulic brakes

05:17.103 --> 05:20.068
and endorse farm subsidy check
for crops I didn't grow.

05:33.456 --> 05:35.636
Okay, 4-H-ers,

05:35.637 --> 05:38.622
here's your summer project:
pick a calf and raise him up

05:38.623 --> 05:41.602
big, strong
and, of course, God-fearing.

05:41.603 --> 05:45.744
And at the end of the summer,
the best calf wins a blue ribbon.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.361
I want a tough one.

05:52.750 --> 05:56.076
I didn't come here today
expecting to fall in love.

06:00.032 --> 06:01.981
Hey, it's the runt.

06:01.982 --> 06:03.580
I'll take anything
but the runt.

06:07.790 --> 06:09.395
looks like
we're partners.

06:09.396 --> 06:12.532
You're a scrappy little misfit,
just like me.

06:12.533 --> 06:14.729
Anyone want to trade?
No reasonable offer refused.

06:14.730 --> 06:16.487
I'll take a chicken.

06:20.773 --> 06:24.966
Pullet, Bantam, Orpington,
Pullet, Flemish Giant,

06:24.967 --> 06:26.296
Pullet, Leghorn...

06:26.297 --> 06:28.586
Keep it down!
I'm trying to feed my runt.

06:30.726 --> 06:32.822
Here, I'll show you what to do.

06:34.874 --> 06:36.990
All right,
I get it, I get it.

06:36.991 --> 06:39.170
- By the way, I'm Mary.
- I'm Bart.

06:39.171 --> 06:42.666
- This is my calf, Lulubelle.
- Uh, you know that's a boy, right?

06:42.667 --> 06:45.048
Oh, I thought she was
peeing out of her nipple.

06:45.049 --> 06:47.648
- How 'bout you just call him "Lou"?
- That's great.

06:47.649 --> 06:48.998
It rhymes "moo."

08:12.959 --> 08:15.307
So what do you think of my calf?

08:16.113 --> 08:18.808
Now son, I'm not here to judge.

08:18.809 --> 08:21.004
- Actually, yes, you are.
- Eh, what?

08:21.005 --> 08:22.577
Oh, right, I am.

08:22.578 --> 08:25.123
Well, I don't know
much about cows,

08:25.124 --> 08:27.629
but I think we have a winner!

08:29.922 --> 08:32.000
You're the greatest cow
in the world!

08:32.001 --> 08:33.961
I'm going to be
your friend forever.

08:33.962 --> 08:36.514
Bart, you do know
what happens next?

08:36.515 --> 08:38.416
- Something happens next?
- Son, your calf is going

08:38.417 --> 08:40.374
to be taken to a feedlot...

08:40.375 --> 08:43.171
- Lots of feed... that sounds good.
- .... then slaughtered.

08:43.172 --> 08:44.984
But he won!

08:44.985 --> 08:47.098
Why don't you kill
the loser cows?

08:47.099 --> 08:49.350
Oh, we will,
but your cow

08:49.351 --> 08:51.158
gets to go first.

08:56.093 --> 08:58.564
Mom, they're going to kill Lou
and make him into food and

08:58.565 --> 09:02.307
fringe vests for gay cowboys.
Can we buy him back? Can we?

09:04.747 --> 09:08.272
honey, we'd love to,
but a prizewinning bull

09:08.273 --> 09:10.767
is thousands of dollars.

09:10.768 --> 09:12.211
Oh, man.

09:12.212 --> 09:16.485
Son, let this be a lesson:
never work hard and don't form

09:16.486 --> 09:20.210
emotional attachments.
Also, don't be a cow.

09:26.108 --> 09:27.359
Lou?

09:29.112 --> 09:33.022
Oh, man, now I feel so bad
I'm imaging I hear your voice.

09:34.049 --> 09:35.598
Leave me alone!

09:35.599 --> 09:38.827
It's not my fault there's nothing good to
eat on this planet except meat!

09:41.120 --> 09:42.940
I can't help you!

09:42.941 --> 09:45.092
I'm just a little boy!

09:46.327 --> 09:48.287
Bart, are you all right?

09:48.288 --> 09:50.384
I hear Lou mooing
in my head.

09:50.385 --> 09:52.174
What you heard
was your conscience

09:52.175 --> 09:54.129
telling you to stop
eating meat.

09:54.130 --> 09:57.121
If I could save Lou,
I'd never eat meat again.

09:57.122 --> 09:59.313
Not even prosciutto and melon!

10:03.330 --> 10:05.481
"Anguished Animals III"?

10:05.482 --> 10:08.025
That wasn't my conscience
mooing, it was...

10:08.026 --> 10:09.906
Tress MacNeille!

10:11.088 --> 10:13.617
All right,
so I put that there

10:13.618 --> 10:15.403
to get you to stop
eating meat.

10:15.484 --> 10:18.115
But your body is going
to miss the protein,

10:18.116 --> 10:20.243
so you'll have
to take these pills.

10:21.473 --> 10:24.307
Sorry, Lis.
I can't be a vegetarian.

10:24.308 --> 10:25.912
I love the taste of death.

10:25.913 --> 10:28.381
But please, help me
get my cow back.

10:28.382 --> 10:30.307
Okay, meet me halfway.

10:30.308 --> 10:33.003
Stop stirring your lemonade
with a sausage.

10:33.004 --> 10:35.140
- Give me a minute.
- Come on.

10:37.061 --> 10:38.782
It's a no-brainer.

10:46.549 --> 10:49.340
Aw, man, I never figured
the gate would be locked.

10:49.341 --> 10:50.920
It's like they knew
we were coming.

10:50.921 --> 10:52.779
Don't worry; I called
some animal activists

10:52.780 --> 10:55.533
who can help us get in.
I'll just give the signal.

10:55.534 --> 10:57.604
Milk is murder.

10:57.605 --> 11:00.111
Cheese is genocide.

11:01.069 --> 11:03.603
- Good to see you, Windsong.
- Windsong?

11:03.604 --> 11:07.040
Yeah, it's my code name. This is
Compost and this is Solar Panel.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.555
What's my code name?

11:14.935 --> 11:16.250
Lisa's Brother.

11:18.374 --> 11:20.994
Forgive us for this violation,
Mother Fence.

11:20.995 --> 11:23.297
We honor
your chain-link spirit.

11:31.410 --> 11:32.729
Lou.

11:34.610 --> 11:35.744
Lou.

11:37.021 --> 11:38.804
Lou, where are you,
little buddy?

11:40.146 --> 11:43.961
Lou, what happened to you?
You got fat.

11:43.962 --> 11:45.314
Of course he did.

11:45.315 --> 11:47.925
His food is laced
with growth hormones.

11:51.558 --> 11:54.448
I don't care how much
of a pumped-up freak you are.

11:54.449 --> 11:56.026
I still love you.

11:56.027 --> 11:58.623
The way Barry Bonds' kids
probably still love him.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.581
Come on. Come on.

12:05.075 --> 12:06.907
How we going to get
him out of here?

12:15.011 --> 12:17.501
Wow, you did learn a lot
at 4-H.

12:17.502 --> 12:18.994
Hell, yeah.

12:22.306 --> 12:24.284
That was a
practice cow.

12:34.643 --> 12:36.171
What are we going
to do with him?

12:36.172 --> 12:38.596
Well, your friend Mary
from 4-H lives on a farm.

12:38.597 --> 12:40.268
Lou can stay with her.

12:40.428 --> 12:42.272
a cow on a farm.

12:42.273 --> 12:44.479
With a moo-moo here
and a moo-moo there...

12:44.480 --> 12:45.931
Yes, it works.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.574
All right, Lou,
to freedom!

12:48.649 --> 12:49.700
Lou?

13:01.596 --> 13:04.976
Howdy, what's yours
that mine's is Cletus?

13:05.711 --> 13:07.605
He wants to know
your name.

13:07.606 --> 13:09.679
Oh, I'm Bart Simpson.
Is Mary here?

13:09.680 --> 13:14.172
Hang on. Hey, Mary, there's a
boy here askin' on you!

13:14.540 --> 13:16.139
Hey, Bart.

13:16.140 --> 13:17.851
I didn't know
Cletus was your dad.

13:17.852 --> 13:21.045
She had a regular city birth
in a gas station.

13:21.046 --> 13:23.395
The feedlot wants to kill Lou
and I can't keep him.

13:23.396 --> 13:24.680
Can I give him to you?

13:26.382 --> 13:30.710
Brandine, a young feller
just offered Mary a cow!

13:30.815 --> 13:32.807
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

13:32.808 --> 13:34.069
What's going on?

13:34.070 --> 13:36.199
According to the traditions
of the hill folk,

13:36.200 --> 13:37.806
by giving our
daughter a cow,

13:37.807 --> 13:40.123
you've made a formal
proposal of marriage.

13:42.277 --> 13:44.686
This calls for a hoedown.

13:44.687 --> 13:47.055
Blow her a song of love.

13:51.753 --> 13:54.175
I said love, not lust.

13:55.118 --> 13:57.514
I can't get married. I'm only ten.

13:57.515 --> 14:00.731
And I have dreams.
I got 1580 on my DQAT.

14:00.732 --> 14:03.547
- DQAT?
- Dairy Queen Aptitude Test.

14:03.548 --> 14:06.038
800 ice cream,
780 Brazier.

14:06.039 --> 14:08.401
Bart, I'll find a way to
get you out of this wedding.

14:08.402 --> 14:11.911
In the meantime, just say yes,
so Lou will be safe.

14:11.912 --> 14:13.716
Look how happy he is.

14:16.048 --> 14:19.429
I wished I had a tail
what did swap away flies.

14:19.430 --> 14:21.406
Mine just hangs there.

14:22.357 --> 14:24.886
All right, sir,
I'll marry your daughter.

14:24.887 --> 14:28.204
We're gonna have us
the fanciest wedding in the county.

14:28.205 --> 14:31.126
Cletus, open up a wall
so Dia-Betty can come.

14:31.127 --> 14:34.423
Oh, just bring 'em to a window,
so I can pinch 'em.

14:34.683 --> 14:37.420
We always figured
someday Mary would marry.

14:37.421 --> 14:39.585
That's why we called her Mary.

14:39.586 --> 14:43.141
We name all our kids after what
we think's gonna happen to 'em.

14:43.142 --> 14:45.271
Ain't that right,
Stabbed-in-jail?

14:45.272 --> 14:47.390
We'll see who stabs who.

14:50.236 --> 14:53.372
Strained spinach?
I'm not going to eat that.

14:53.373 --> 14:55.271
It's yucky.

14:55.789 --> 14:59.409
Yo, I'm the coolest puppet
in Sockville,

14:59.410 --> 15:02.605
and I love
strained spinach.

15:02.606 --> 15:05.358
Really? I  guess I'll
try it then.

15:08.897 --> 15:12.192
I wonder
if Maggie would like it.

15:13.665 --> 15:17.703
Mom, Dad! Bart's marrying
one of Cletus' daughters.

15:18.860 --> 15:21.405
We're putting a stop
to this right now.

15:21.406 --> 15:23.877
Wait. If you stop the wedding,
Bart's cow will die,

15:23.878 --> 15:25.635
and he really cares
about that cow

15:25.636 --> 15:28.599
and Bart doesn't usually care
about stuff, so help.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.419
all right,
I've got an idea,

15:31.420 --> 15:34.207
- but it'll take a lot of sewing.
- I'll get your fabrics.

15:34.208 --> 15:36.925
And I'll make sure
Flanders doesn't bother us.

15:38.544 --> 15:40.086
What was that for?

15:40.087 --> 15:42.694
Bart's in trouble and we don't
need your stupid comments.

15:42.695 --> 15:44.058
Zippin' it up.

16:00.900 --> 16:03.475
Okay, let's set up the
chitlin bar over here.

16:03.476 --> 16:06.747
Uh, start drizzling the crawdad
reduction on the possum pouches.

16:06.748 --> 16:10.310
And excuse me, why are the spittoons
so far from the chaw station?

16:10.311 --> 16:12.648
This is a wedding, people,
not a funeral.

16:17.067 --> 16:18.985
Here you go,
sweetheart.

16:18.986 --> 16:20.578
Something old...

16:22.706 --> 16:26.112
... something new,
something burrowed,

16:26.113 --> 16:28.028
and something stew.

16:28.029 --> 16:30.019
Mama, you know I love
your somethin' stew,

16:30.020 --> 16:32.296
but I got no appetite
for any of this.

16:32.854 --> 16:34.612
you just got cold feet...

16:34.613 --> 16:37.312
'cause you're barefoot
and our floor's made of mud.

16:39.061 --> 16:40.548
Have you seen my sister?

16:40.549 --> 16:42.725
No, and she's cutting
it pretty close.

16:42.726 --> 16:45.485
We're about ten minutes away
from "You may kiss the bride."

16:45.486 --> 16:47.826
Kiss?! I thought we were
just getting married.

16:48.539 --> 16:53.051
Do you, Bart Simpson,
take Mary Wrestlemania Spuckler

16:53.052 --> 16:55.106
to be your lawful
wedded wife

16:55.107 --> 16:57.642
for as long as you
both shall reckon?

17:00.907 --> 17:02.211
I do.

17:02.212 --> 17:05.013
And since we don't need
to hear from women folk

17:05.015 --> 17:07.820
what they think,
I now pronounce you...

17:07.821 --> 17:09.643
Stop the wedding!

17:10.421 --> 17:12.945
Bart is a ten-year-old boy.

17:12.946 --> 17:16.454
He still sits in the driveway
and pretends to drive the car.

17:18.730 --> 17:20.685
Mom, I have to do this.

17:20.685 --> 17:23.579
- I love that big ol' cow.
- How could you say that?

17:23.579 --> 17:25.719
I starved myself to
get into this dress.

17:25.720 --> 17:27.421
No, no, no, no, no,
you look great, honey.

17:27.422 --> 17:29.892
Mom, if I don't get married,
they'll take Lou.

17:30.421 --> 17:33.331
I'm sorry, Bart,
but sometimes

17:33.332 --> 17:35.438
your mom knows best.

17:35.620 --> 17:38.509
Son, I'm afraid
hillbilly law is clear.

17:38.510 --> 17:41.602
If this marriage is off,
then that cow is going

17:41.603 --> 17:44.305
back to the feedlot,
and Mary must taste

17:44.306 --> 17:47.858
the bitter agony
of being an old maid of 11.

17:47.859 --> 17:49.546
Don't feel
bad, sweetie.

17:49.547 --> 17:51.869
I was 13 when I
married your father.

17:51.870 --> 17:55.235
Yeah, and you'd already
been divorced four times.

17:58.604 --> 18:00.068
Good-bye, Lou.

18:00.069 --> 18:01.904
I'll never forget you.

18:04.596 --> 18:07.142
Mom, how could
you do this to me?

18:07.143 --> 18:10.165
Sweetie, don't you think your mom
might have a trick up her sleeve?

18:10.166 --> 18:11.269
No.

18:11.270 --> 18:14.283
- Trust me.
- D'oh! I mean, moo!

18:17.452 --> 18:18.932
Okay, they bought it.

18:18.933 --> 18:21.534
- Have you got Lou in your car?
- Roger that.

18:23.594 --> 18:26.363
You guys come and get me as soon
as they dump me in the feedlot.

18:33.349 --> 18:35.977
Ooh, "Laughter House."
With the world

18:35.978 --> 18:39.252
in the shape it's in,
we could all use some comedy.

18:43.353 --> 18:45.812
Okay, have fun at
the Laughter House.

18:45.813 --> 18:48.927
Now I'll just turn off my
phone to save the battery.

18:55.389 --> 18:57.281
Great plan, Mom.

18:57.282 --> 18:58.942
But where is Lou
going to go?

18:59.553 --> 19:01.137
Don't worry, Bart.

19:01.138 --> 19:03.585
In India, your cow
will be treated like a god

19:03.602 --> 19:05.883
and receive the food
and medical care

19:05.884 --> 19:08.271
that in America would go
to human beings.

19:11.322 --> 19:13.634
Lou,
if that plane leaves the ground

19:13.635 --> 19:15.609
and you're not on it,
you'll regret it.

19:15.610 --> 19:18.982
Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow, but soon,

19:18.983 --> 19:21.542
and definitely
after they kill you

19:21.543 --> 19:23.837
and make you into sloppy joes.

19:32.999 --> 19:35.434
Here's looking at you, cud.

19:42.889 --> 19:45.916
Okay, Lisa, I'm turning
my phone back on

19:45.917 --> 19:48.667
to see if your father
is ready to be picked up.

19:49.431 --> 19:52.222
I have over 400 text messages.

19:52.395 --> 19:55.125
Ready... for... pickup.

19:55.177 --> 19:58.204
Ready... for... pickup.

20:01.190 --> 20:04.269
I'm a human being! Let me go!

20:11.297 --> 20:13.928
You are now entering the killing floor.

20:14.002 --> 20:15.637
that sounds
like Tress MacNeille.

20:28.118 --> 20:32.040
Marge, kids,
the things I saw.

20:32.152 --> 20:35.140
It makes me never want
to eat meat again.

20:35.141 --> 20:40.199
Just fish, chicken, burgers, veal on
Fridays, deer, but only in season

20:40.200 --> 20:43.867
and if necessary, the
sweetest meat of all: human.

20:43.868 --> 20:46.464
For you, Dad,
I consider that a victory.

20:47.666 --> 20:50.112
You're in a better place now, Lou,

20:50.113 --> 20:53.391
and I'll always be proud
that for once in my life,

20:53.442 --> 20:55.433
I had a cow, man.

20:56.305 --> 21:02.773
