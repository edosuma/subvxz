00:01.369 --> 00:03.537
ANNOUNCER: Thanks for
downloading this Fox show.

00:03.571 --> 00:06.040
And don't miss
all-new episodes on Fox.

00:08.709 --> 00:09.910
Previously on Empire...
I didn't know Gram was

00:09.943 --> 00:11.312
performing with Tiana tonight.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.346
LUCIOUS:
Why don't you spit some napalm

00:12.380 --> 00:15.316
on a diss track and bury him

00:15.349 --> 00:16.317
and everything
he cares about.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.186
There is no head of A&R
to oversee the deal.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.321
COOKIE: We hired Xavier Rosen.
BECKY: Who?

00:20.354 --> 00:22.223
Given the dangers
to Ms. Gathers,

00:22.256 --> 00:23.557
the court agrees to grant bail.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.025
LUCIOUS:
What I was most proud of

00:25.059 --> 00:26.894
was that you paid off
that doctor.

00:26.927 --> 00:29.330
How does it feel to know
you're just like your daddy?

00:29.363 --> 00:31.499
I had to put in work
on a couple of cats.
Mm-hmm.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.234
The three horsemen
who wanted us dead.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.702
LUCIOUS: Well, there was
a fourth horseman.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.504
But Shine, he ain't no snitch.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.038
Cookie, we're not
that different.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.774
I truly believe we
can make this work.

00:40.808 --> 00:42.410
That was hot.
Oh, so...

00:42.443 --> 00:44.212
first you hate me,
then you love me.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.446
You have no idea...

00:47.381 --> 00:48.382
...what you're worth.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.418
SHINE:
An attack on me is an attack

00:50.451 --> 00:52.220
on each and every one of you.

00:52.253 --> 00:55.123
Lucious and Andre Lyon
want a war.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.257
So we war.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.827
(heavy bass beat playing)

01:02.896 --> 01:05.399
Yeah, that feel right to you?

01:05.433 --> 01:08.402
I think you could make
that bass a little harder.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.204
Yeah.
(chuckles)

01:10.238 --> 01:12.240
Look, I know we haven't
worked together in a while,

01:12.273 --> 01:13.807
but I appreciate you
coming through.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.976
Feel like this is about
to be something big.

01:16.009 --> 01:17.978
Couldn't think
of anyone better.

01:18.011 --> 01:19.547
Oh, come on, Mal.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.549
You know we make
good music together.

01:21.582 --> 01:22.750
Yeah.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.285
Yeah, we do.

01:24.318 --> 01:27.255
But that's all we
need to do, Derek.

01:29.857 --> 01:32.426
(heavy bass beat continues)

01:44.205 --> 01:45.673
Let's go kill some Lyons.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.040
You heard him.
Let's roll.

01:56.484 --> 01:59.653
Now, you know I love getting
coffee with you before work,

01:59.687 --> 02:01.455
but one of these days,

02:01.489 --> 02:03.257
you got to let me bring
it to you in bed.

02:03.291 --> 02:06.494
Huh.
Well, I might like that,

02:06.527 --> 02:09.096
one of these days
in the far future.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.131
Oh, the future, okay.
(laughs)

02:12.966 --> 02:14.702
Come on.
No... no sugar? No cream?

02:14.735 --> 02:16.704
Oh, no. I like mine
dark and strong.

02:16.737 --> 02:19.873
Ah, well, you're gonna have to
do a little better than that

02:19.907 --> 02:22.009
if you want to get
in these drawers.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.444
(both laugh)

02:23.477 --> 02:25.045
Make a right right here.

02:25.078 --> 02:26.514
Watch out for the cops.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.454
LUCIOUS: And make sure Tony
has his guys fan out.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.855
MAN:
Yes, sir.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.357
And we got
three marks over there

02:36.390 --> 02:38.726
at that hot dog stand.

02:38.759 --> 02:42.330
Now, you see that dude
with the newspaper?

02:42.363 --> 02:43.731
Nobody reads
print anymore.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.534
ANIKA:
I never thought I'd be making

02:46.567 --> 02:48.536
doctor visits in an armored
personnel carrier.

02:48.569 --> 02:51.071
Well, I know Shine;
he's gonna clap back.

02:51.104 --> 02:52.673
So if you want
to step your ass out

02:52.706 --> 02:54.141
and see if you're bulletproof,
go ahead.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.444
*

03:06.520 --> 03:09.056
HAKEEM: I'm-a try Nessa
one more time.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.991
CHICKEN:
Still texting Nessa again?

03:11.024 --> 03:12.326
When you gonna hit that?

03:12.360 --> 03:14.362
(sighs) I will.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.864
I want her to meet
my daughter.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.267
Cute little babies,
that always gets the girls.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.402
CHICKEN: I thought it was your
rap skills that got the honeys.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.271
HAKEEM:
That, too.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.373
I'm-a invite her
to my livestream concert.

03:25.406 --> 03:29.377
Once she sees me doing my thing,
it's game over.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.378
That's gonna be enough?

03:30.411 --> 03:32.045
Period.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.282
(tires screech)

03:38.386 --> 03:39.720
Get him.
Yeah.

03:39.753 --> 03:42.623
And that bitch of his gonna
catch a few of these, too.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.563
(chuckles) So why are you
going through so much trouble

03:49.597 --> 03:51.399
to announce
you're running for mayor?

03:51.432 --> 03:53.401
I say just call
a couple reporters...
Right.

03:53.434 --> 03:55.035
...do the damn thing,
and keep it moving.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.604
Well, you know, I just
want to be prepared

03:56.637 --> 03:59.106
for any questions
they might throw at me.

03:59.139 --> 04:01.108
Oh. Yeah, questions like,

04:01.141 --> 04:03.377
uh, "Why are you trying
to date an ex-con?" Huh?

04:03.411 --> 04:05.946
Yes, they may ask that.
But, look, I'll just say,

04:05.979 --> 04:08.215
"I haven't been to
third base yet," so...
(laughs)

04:08.248 --> 04:11.385
Unless we're planning on, you
know, changing that tonight.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.387
No. I got to see
my P.O. tomorrow.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.723
You still have a
parole officer?

04:15.756 --> 04:17.558
Yeah, it's called
supervised release, so...

04:17.591 --> 04:19.560
Heads up, Councilman.
Excuse me, Ms. Lyon.

04:19.593 --> 04:20.594
You need to come with us.

04:20.628 --> 04:21.795
Step back.
Uh, no, I don't.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.431
I don't even know
who the hell you are.

04:23.464 --> 04:24.598
All right, stand down.

04:24.632 --> 04:25.599
What's going on
here, gentlemen?

04:25.633 --> 04:26.600
All due respect, Councilman.

04:26.634 --> 04:27.468
Your husband sent us, ma'am.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.470
For your own safety.
He is not my hu...

04:29.503 --> 04:31.071
Come with us, ma'am.
He's not my husband.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.740
Look, I don't know
what he did this time.

04:32.773 --> 04:33.841
Stay back. Stay back.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.275
COOKIE:
Get your hands off of me!

04:35.309 --> 04:36.810
I'm sorry!

04:43.484 --> 04:44.485
(elevator bell dings)

04:47.621 --> 04:49.256
ANDRE: Long night at the studio,
huh, brother?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.291
Get some of these eggs, man.

04:51.325 --> 04:52.360
I made plenty.

04:53.461 --> 04:54.462
Good morning, sunshine.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.539
(gun clicks)

05:07.408 --> 05:09.410
*

05:16.584 --> 05:18.018
Yo...

05:18.051 --> 05:19.653
Shine, what the hell
are you doing?!

05:19.687 --> 05:21.088
What the hell
are y doing here?!

05:22.356 --> 05:24.492
You smashing this dude?

05:25.526 --> 05:28.496
After what him
and his father did to me?

05:28.529 --> 05:30.898
That's how you got
the bruise, Andre?

05:30.931 --> 05:32.500
We had a disagreement.

05:32.533 --> 05:33.667
Oh, we had a disagreement.

05:33.701 --> 05:34.802
No, no, no. (pants)

05:34.835 --> 05:36.069
Shine, look at me.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.471
Get out the way, Nessa.
Look at me!

05:37.505 --> 05:39.473
You're my brother,
and I love you.

05:39.507 --> 05:42.042
I ain't got nobody else!
You know that.

05:42.075 --> 05:45.012
And I will not have you catching
a case over this. Look at me.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.447
Let's go.

05:47.715 --> 05:48.716
Let's go.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.751
Let's go, Shine.

05:52.553 --> 05:53.921
(crying)

05:53.954 --> 05:55.823
Shine...

05:55.856 --> 05:57.324
No! Shine!

05:57.357 --> 05:58.559
(Nessa sobbing)

05:58.592 --> 06:01.895
I don't get my hands dirty
in front of her.

06:01.929 --> 06:04.532
But I'll be back.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.434
In fact, I think
I'll save you for last.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.437
(elevator bell dings)

06:15.142 --> 06:17.144
(exhales)

06:21.482 --> 06:22.983
Hey, brother.

06:25.419 --> 06:27.521
Sorry about my friends, man.

06:27.555 --> 06:30.558
Sometimes they, uh... (laughs)

06:30.591 --> 06:32.593
they get out of hand.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.576
What's with all the security
outside my spot?

06:48.609 --> 06:50.711
We're good for my livestream
show on Friday, right?

06:50.744 --> 06:51.912
Not exactly, Hakeem.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.747
Lucious,
why don't you tell him.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.749
As I was saying,
once Shine

06:55.783 --> 06:56.884
reentered into my orbit,

06:56.917 --> 06:58.752
I knew there was
gonna come a time

06:58.786 --> 07:01.421
in which he needed
to be corrected.

07:01.455 --> 07:03.223
So fortunately, last night,

07:03.256 --> 07:04.958
my eldest son
and I decided

07:04.992 --> 07:08.762
that his actions were
extremely disrespectful

07:08.796 --> 07:10.498
and, if left unchecked,

07:10.531 --> 07:12.833
a threat to this family.
And so we...

07:13.934 --> 07:15.603
...checked his ass.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.571
Checked him how?

07:17.605 --> 07:19.172
How you think?

07:19.206 --> 07:21.575
Except now Shine is at my place
trying to clap back.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.811
I'm sorry about that, Jamal;
it won't happen again.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.779
I'm moving in
to Pop's guesthouse.

07:25.813 --> 07:28.248
No, Dre.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.751
Trust me, you don't want to be
all up under him like that.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.352
Hold up.
We beating up our friends now?

07:32.385 --> 07:33.754
Boy, he is not your friend.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.690
Look, all of y'all,
the only reason why

07:36.724 --> 07:39.192
we are even messing with him
is to block Tariq

07:39.226 --> 07:41.495
from building a case against us,
you got that?

07:42.996 --> 07:44.932
Now, how in the hell
are we gonna stop him

07:44.965 --> 07:46.534
from flipping out on us now?

07:46.567 --> 07:48.168
Because Shine is not a snitch.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.970
He'd rather be dead
than be a rat.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.438
I swear,
am I the only one...

07:51.471 --> 07:52.640
See, you love
this type of drama.

07:52.673 --> 07:53.974
Yeah, he does.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.009
It brought my family
back together, didn't it?

07:56.043 --> 07:58.612
The music I'm doing with Shine
is some of my best stuff.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.447
Well, you're gonna have
to postpone that for now.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.949
I already told my fans
it's happening.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.684
I don't care
what you told your fans!

08:03.717 --> 08:05.385
Ain't no do-overs in
live streaming, Mom.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.788
There also ain't no do-overs
if you get shot in the head.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.456
Look, look, relax.
Ain't nobody changing anything.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.391
Everything stays
according to what we're doing.

08:11.424 --> 08:15.362
Everybody just needs to be alert
and stay in their lane.

08:15.395 --> 08:17.965
And then soon as you're
done playing house with...

08:17.998 --> 08:20.167
the mayor of
Dingleberry,

08:20.200 --> 08:22.636
you owe me a Tiana single.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.404
And, Jamal, you can
go back to doing

08:24.437 --> 08:26.674
whatever you do when
you're not making music.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.842
You want to help the family?
You help the family.

08:28.876 --> 08:31.311
You want to go and free
the world? Free the world.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.715
But, Keem,
your Empire XStream show

08:34.748 --> 08:36.750
goes on as planned.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.686
We got to keep
pushing them stats up.

08:38.719 --> 08:41.054
I got Shine
exactly where I want him.

08:41.088 --> 08:43.757
Now it's time to tuck
his little bitch ass in.

08:58.572 --> 09:01.274
*

09:01.308 --> 09:03.276
There he is!
Hakeem!

09:03.310 --> 09:04.477
(reporters clamoring)

09:06.146 --> 09:07.615
What's up,
little brother?

09:07.648 --> 09:09.783
(heavy bass beat playing)
You feeling this track?

09:16.456 --> 09:19.559
You already know.

09:19.593 --> 09:20.661
(chuckles):
Get in.

09:22.730 --> 09:23.864
Yo, can you pause that?

09:23.897 --> 09:26.133
(music stops)
Yo, you want it?

09:28.769 --> 09:30.738
What I got to do for it?

09:30.771 --> 09:32.773
Make your Empire XStream
event a double bill.

09:32.806 --> 09:33.774
You and me.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.776
Come on, bro, I'm doing
my own jam right now.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.645
No, I get it, Hakeem.
But listen,

09:37.678 --> 09:40.113
we could give the people what
they missed out on at the ASAs.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.149
And keeping it real,
I need it, too.

09:42.182 --> 09:45.118
It's important that I show the
fans that I'm still in the game.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.553
Bro, you can't even perform.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.121
You know that.
Not in front of

09:48.155 --> 09:49.957
a big crowd with all these
bells and whistles, no.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.125
But I was thinking we could
do it at my living room.

09:52.159 --> 09:53.661
We could make it
mad intimate

09:53.694 --> 09:55.963
and just blast it out
to the fans.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.597
(sighs):
Maybe.

09:57.631 --> 09:58.899
Hakeem

09:58.932 --> 10:00.734
and Jamal, the Lyon brothers.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.670
Live and alive.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.738
You know the message
that that sends to the world?

10:04.772 --> 10:06.774
Why we even doing music

10:06.807 --> 10:08.942
if we don't make a real imprint
on the next generations?

10:08.976 --> 10:10.778
You know what this is about?

10:10.811 --> 10:12.746
You and Dad.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.915
That "end the cycle" beef
you got with him.

10:14.948 --> 10:15.949
Nah, man,

10:15.983 --> 10:17.617
it's about you and Bella.

10:17.651 --> 10:20.420
It's about the fact that
our father-- her grandfather--

10:20.453 --> 10:21.922
beat up your favorite producer.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.525
That's really the type of world
you want her to grow up in?

10:28.862 --> 10:30.698
We're going to Laviticus.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.232
Yes, sir, Mr. Lyon.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.971
JAMAL (laughs):
All right, listen.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.973
What's up, y'all?
It's your boy, Jamal Lyon.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.608
And I'm the smooth
baby brother, Hakeem.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.143
And we have a very
special announcement.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.178
Tell 'em, Keem.
Yeah. Nah, you tell 'em, Mal.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.715
All right, look, this Friday
make sure y'all are tuned in,

10:47.748 --> 10:49.950
8:00-- we have a
very special event.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.952
And look, #TeamKeem,
all day, ladies.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.653
Yeah, yeah.
Y'all know what that is.

10:53.687 --> 10:54.722
Hey, what kind of fun-boy stuff

10:54.755 --> 10:55.856
y'all two clowns

10:55.889 --> 10:56.957
doing up there, man?

10:56.990 --> 10:58.125
Hey, yo, what
this dude doing

10:58.158 --> 10:59.559
in our spot for, man?!
Yo, yo, yo...

10:59.592 --> 11:01.028
What it look like
I'm doing, man?

11:01.061 --> 11:03.230
I'm coming at you.
You a MC. Battle me.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.032
What, you want to go right now,
little man?
Keem...

11:05.065 --> 11:06.834
No, let's do it
in front of your subscribers.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.235
Let them enjoy the show.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.203
I'm-a bring my
subscribers, too.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.840
I designed my own little
streaming apps and everything.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.574
I didn't need daddy money
for that.

11:14.607 --> 11:16.243
(others laugh)
But since I'm a gentleman,

11:16.276 --> 11:18.345
that's what I'm-a
do for you, okay?

11:18.378 --> 11:20.013
I'm-a have you bloody
and trending worldwide

11:20.047 --> 11:22.382
in a matter of seconds.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.151
Say "cheese" for the camera.
Y'all like selfies, right?

11:24.184 --> 11:25.418
Yeah, anything
for the fans.
(camera clicks)

11:25.452 --> 11:26.486
Thank you.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.188
We're gonna leave, man.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.189
(camera clicks)

11:29.222 --> 11:30.891
(chuckles)

11:30.924 --> 11:33.994
I got to go talk to him.
Wait, stop. Come here!

11:34.027 --> 11:35.996
You are better than that.
We are better than that.

11:36.029 --> 11:36.864
Look at me.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.900
Start using your
mind, all right?

11:39.933 --> 11:41.769
How the hell did he
even get up in here

11:41.802 --> 11:42.970
with all of this
security around?

11:45.873 --> 11:47.908
Lucious.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.910
BECKY: So, we have
that great new song,

11:49.943 --> 11:51.178
"Starlight." Tiana loves it,

11:51.211 --> 11:52.880
and I think it's time
to record it.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.047
Well, I don't think
it's a lead single.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.515
Now, the song she
did at Laviticus is

11:55.548 --> 11:57.617
already getting crazy heat.
And the numbers show...

11:57.650 --> 11:59.452
Can we just stop
with the numbers really quickly?

11:59.486 --> 12:02.422
I actually spoke to Tiana, and
that song is not what she wants.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.024
Well, Becky, in A&R,
we can't always

12:04.057 --> 12:05.692
give in to what
the artist wants.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.860
Do not mansplain to me.

12:06.894 --> 12:09.930
And especially do not
white-mansplain to me.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.598
Then don't be uninformed.

12:11.631 --> 12:12.866
Now, if it makes
you feel better,

12:12.900 --> 12:14.267
we can throw an
experimental track

12:14.301 --> 12:16.303
deeper in the album.
This isn't about how I feel,

12:16.336 --> 12:18.405
first of all,
and secondly, I disagree...

12:18.438 --> 12:20.040
with everything
that you are.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.042
Okay. Let's put down the guns.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.643
All right?
(clears throat)

12:23.676 --> 12:25.612
Fiddler on the Roof here
has a point.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.047
He's looking
at the bigger picture.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.648
And I agree with him.

12:28.681 --> 12:31.318
That song Tiana did
is getting crazy heat,

12:31.351 --> 12:33.887
so that is the song
we will record. Okay?

12:33.921 --> 12:36.056
All right, now,
can't we just all get along?

12:36.089 --> 12:36.857
Kiss and make up.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.793
BECKY:
Don't.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.663
*

12:46.967 --> 12:48.969
ANDRE:
Nessa.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.437
Thanks for coming.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.505
You okay?

12:52.539 --> 12:54.741
Yeah, I...

12:54.774 --> 12:56.276
What the hell is going on, Dre?

12:56.309 --> 12:58.745
You think you can
just hook up with me

12:58.778 --> 13:00.580
and then not tell me
that you just got done

13:00.613 --> 13:01.849
stomping out my best friend?

13:01.882 --> 13:04.117
That's what we doing?
I should've told you.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.785
I couldn't help it.

13:07.687 --> 13:09.156
So what do we do now?

13:11.191 --> 13:13.360
Lucious wants to have
a sit-down with Shine

13:13.393 --> 13:14.594
and get things
back on track.

13:14.627 --> 13:15.695
What? A sit...

13:15.728 --> 13:17.130
I promise you, Nessa,

13:17.164 --> 13:18.798
we're not gonna
screw him over.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.134
You better not, Dre.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.003
Because he's all I got.

13:23.036 --> 13:25.305
Come here.
N...

13:25.338 --> 13:27.975
Come here.
Come here. Come here.

13:33.013 --> 13:35.883
I respect that
he's all you got.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.918
You could have more.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.522
What you said
when you came to see me--

13:42.555 --> 13:46.126
if you had my musical talent...

13:46.159 --> 13:47.494
what did you mean by that?

13:47.527 --> 13:50.097
Help me get Shine
to the table.

13:52.199 --> 13:55.068
I'll show you
what I meant by that.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.009
All right, Keem,
you ready to put...

14:04.011 --> 14:06.013
You look surprised
to see me.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.214
Surprised.

14:07.247 --> 14:11.151
But happy to see my son,
even if it's the wrong one.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.953
(chuckles):
Okay.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.089
Well, look, I have good news.

14:16.123 --> 14:19.059
Hakeem is squashing that little
petty-ass beef with Gram.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.560
So, yes, I...

14:20.593 --> 14:23.863
I lost Freda, but...
I'm not losing Hakeem.

14:23.897 --> 14:28.068
Why are you throwing bricks when
you live in a glass house, son?

14:28.101 --> 14:30.337
Have you forgotten
all those lies you told

14:30.370 --> 14:32.405
in order to get Freda
out of that place?

14:32.439 --> 14:34.574
I did what I had to do.
Yeah, and then

14:34.607 --> 14:37.110
you dropped her ass back off
in the projects.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.446
You know,
Shakespeare said,

14:39.479 --> 14:41.214
"To thy own self be true."

14:41.248 --> 14:44.417
The sooner you accept that you
are the younger version of me--

14:44.451 --> 14:47.087
with a twist--
the sooner you'll be

14:47.120 --> 14:49.957
back on that stage and
be your old self again.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.759
It's this space, man.

14:52.792 --> 14:55.228
Last time I sat in this chair,
I turned against my mother.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.763
Because she deserved it.

14:56.796 --> 14:58.631
And what do
you deserve?

14:58.665 --> 15:00.600
How you get
so corrupt?

15:00.633 --> 15:03.236
There's no way that
you were born this way.

15:03.270 --> 15:07.374
Jamal, you are 50% genetically
predisposed to become me.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.576
It's inevitable.

15:09.609 --> 15:12.145
You know what
I like about Keem?

15:12.179 --> 15:15.482
He knows that
he likes what I like,

15:15.515 --> 15:17.917
and he knows
he's going to become me.

15:17.951 --> 15:20.087
He knows nothing except
what you told him.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.289
Maybe you should let him be
the man he wants to be

15:22.322 --> 15:23.991
instead of the man
that you want him to be.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.093
Oh, my God,
you are so corny, Mal.

15:26.126 --> 15:29.462
I'm-a book a duet
with you and Mary Magdalene,

15:29.496 --> 15:32.465
soon as God gives me the okay.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.501
Oops. I said no.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.108
*

15:46.213 --> 15:48.681
Hey, girl. How you doing?

15:48.715 --> 15:50.283
You look good!
You lost weight.

15:50.317 --> 15:53.086
Julio, my man. Oh.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.188
(laughs)

15:55.222 --> 15:56.956
Sharlene!
Holloway.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.159
Hey, girl,
I bought you your favorite.

15:59.192 --> 16:02.129
Keep it. You're late.
Excuse me?

16:02.162 --> 16:05.198
Your appointment was 9:00 a.m.
It's a quarter to 10:00.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.699
(chuckles)

16:06.733 --> 16:10.137
I know, but I always
come here at this time.

16:10.170 --> 16:13.773
You seem a little off.
Is there something I can do?

16:13.806 --> 16:15.342
The rules of your supervised
release stipulate that

16:15.375 --> 16:17.710
you need to contact me
if you're going to be late.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.346
I'm gonna have to write you up.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.887
(chuckles)
What's going on, Sharlene?

16:27.920 --> 16:29.889
I don't know
what you mean.

16:29.922 --> 16:31.891
Well, the last time I was here,

16:31.924 --> 16:34.294
you were showing me pictures
of your kids, and...

16:34.327 --> 16:35.562
now you're acting brand-new.

16:35.595 --> 16:36.696
About that.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.465
Your last visit
was three months ago.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.134
Since you can't tell time,
we're going to have to have you

16:41.168 --> 16:42.302
report here three times a week.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.171
Oh! Sharlene, no, come on, now.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.505
You know I run a company.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.374
I can't come here
three times a week.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.741
This isn't
some thug rapper

16:48.775 --> 16:50.310
you're negotiating with,
Holloway.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.746
This is
the United States government.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.591
You need time
to consider,

17:04.624 --> 17:07.194
I can send you back to Danbury
to think it over.

17:07.227 --> 17:10.097
Right now,
you need to use the bathroom.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.216
Let's just get this over with.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.950
I'm sorry.

17:30.983 --> 17:33.520
I know you're not excited
to come in to record "Me."

17:33.553 --> 17:35.955
I get it-- it's
what Cookie wants.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.959
What if I told you
that you're actually here

17:39.992 --> 17:41.594
to record "Starlight"

17:41.628 --> 17:44.197
because it's about to be
your lead single?

17:44.231 --> 17:46.366
What? I thought
Cookie said that...

17:46.399 --> 17:49.136
No, I...
I talked her out of it.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.971
I told her that
you were gonna get in that booth

17:52.004 --> 17:53.640
and slay the hell
out of that song,

17:53.673 --> 17:55.808
and she... agreed with me.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.244
Are you serious?
Dead serious.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.412
Oh, my God! Yo, thank you!

17:59.446 --> 18:00.547
You're the best.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.582
You know I got your back
like bra straps, girl.

18:02.615 --> 18:03.583
(laughs) Yo!

18:03.616 --> 18:04.584
I'm-a always

18:04.617 --> 18:06.286
get you what
you want. Yeah!
Yes!

18:06.319 --> 18:07.254
(both laugh)

18:08.621 --> 18:11.090
LUCIOUS:
"I asked for bread in the name

18:11.124 --> 18:15.428
"of love and mercy,
but humanity did not heed me.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.669
So now I shall take it
in the name of evil."

18:24.437 --> 18:25.838
Why's she always sleeping?

18:25.872 --> 18:27.006
(sighs)

18:27.039 --> 18:28.608
'Cause that's what
babies do, son.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.411
They sleep.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.080
But you can't
afford to do that.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.249
You see, as a patriarch
of the family,

18:36.283 --> 18:37.984
you're responsible for

18:38.017 --> 18:42.455
teaching your young ones how
to survive in this cold world.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.690
Jamal don't
understand that.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.091
He thinks it's all

18:45.124 --> 18:47.394
Kumbaya and love,
but he's wrong.

18:49.329 --> 18:50.297
(sighs)

18:50.330 --> 18:51.864
It's kill or be killed.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.032
Eat or be eaten.

18:53.065 --> 18:54.434
Look, I know
you're trying

18:54.467 --> 18:55.702
to get me up under you

18:55.735 --> 18:57.304
like how you got Andre
up under you.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.439
(sighs)

18:59.472 --> 19:00.940
I want you to crush Gram

19:00.973 --> 19:02.609
because it means money
for Empire,

19:02.642 --> 19:05.345
and Empire XStream
needs that kind of

19:05.378 --> 19:07.046
fanfare and activity.

19:07.079 --> 19:09.482
But I want you to destroy him,

19:09.516 --> 19:11.050
'cause you're a Lyon,

19:11.083 --> 19:13.453
and I want the world to know
that you're not someone

19:13.486 --> 19:16.289
to be trifled with.

19:16.323 --> 19:20.393
I want this little girl to know
what kind of man her daddy is.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.629
Why is everybody
bringing Bella into this?

19:22.662 --> 19:25.465
Because, like you...

19:25.498 --> 19:28.835
she was born a Lyon.

19:28.868 --> 19:31.271
So she's born into this.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.874
See this book?

19:34.907 --> 19:36.309
It's written by Kahlil Gibran.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.877
It's called A Tear and a Smile.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.546
Inside it is

19:39.579 --> 19:42.482
the story of "The Criminal."

19:42.515 --> 19:46.486
It tells of a young man...

19:46.519 --> 19:48.321
who was very kind of heart,

19:48.355 --> 19:52.058
and he depended
on the kindness of humanity

19:52.091 --> 19:53.993
in order for him to eat.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.697
But after some time, he found
himself starving to death.

19:57.730 --> 20:00.333
And right when you thought
he was about to die,

20:00.367 --> 20:02.735
he realized his own true nature.

20:02.769 --> 20:05.938
You see, Keem, the nature
of humanity isn't

20:05.972 --> 20:09.276
love and peaceful,
it's dark

20:09.309 --> 20:11.210
and beastly.

20:11.244 --> 20:14.547
And it'll turn the meek
and the humble into a criminal,

20:14.581 --> 20:17.417
and the sons
of peace into...

20:17.450 --> 20:19.952
destroyers of men.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.795
He became a destroyer of men.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.630
Because he had to.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.774
*

20:41.808 --> 20:44.911
* No matter what,
you know I'm here forever *

20:44.944 --> 20:47.580
* No matter what, I know
you're here forever *

20:47.614 --> 20:50.583
* We've been through the storm
and we're still together *

20:50.617 --> 20:53.152
* We're back together now as

20:53.185 --> 20:56.456
* One...

20:56.489 --> 20:58.625
* It's you and me
over everything *

20:58.658 --> 21:01.794
* One...

21:01.828 --> 21:04.464
* It's you and me
over everything *

21:04.497 --> 21:07.767
* Leave it all behind,
no more wasting time *

21:07.800 --> 21:11.838
* Too focused on
what's behind us now *

21:11.871 --> 21:15.508
* Made it through the fight,
finally got it right *

21:15.542 --> 21:18.811
* This is what
I've been waiting for *

21:18.845 --> 21:23.350
* Practically my whole

21:23.383 --> 21:28.020
* Life...

21:28.054 --> 21:30.457
Brother.

21:30.490 --> 21:31.991
(heavy bass beat playing)

21:38.665 --> 21:40.199
What is...?

21:44.671 --> 21:46.639
* See, I always stayed down
for my bros *

21:46.673 --> 21:49.008
* Because loyalty is all I know,
down to ride for 'em *

21:49.041 --> 21:51.778
* And I won't lose control even
when we hit bumps in the road *

21:51.811 --> 21:53.446
* We get money on our own

21:53.480 --> 21:55.482
* And treat it like baseball
and bring it back home *

21:55.515 --> 21:57.484
* No King Kong, but we strong,
so just like the bank *

21:57.517 --> 21:59.318
* Better leave us alone,
like we car shoppin' *

21:59.352 --> 22:01.654
* Swear we been through
a whole lot *
That's too far.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.623
* We swerved around
all the roadblocks *

22:03.656 --> 22:04.791
* I put my family
over everything *

22:04.824 --> 22:06.626
* Like hot sauce
on the stove top *

22:06.659 --> 22:07.627
* Don't want me retaliate

22:07.660 --> 22:10.062
* Don't mess
with nobody related *

22:10.096 --> 22:11.798
* I roll for my bros,
you know, for my folks *

22:11.831 --> 22:13.400
* I'm going as hard
as the pavement *

22:13.433 --> 22:15.301
* If they need anything,
then I got 'em *

22:15.334 --> 22:17.003
* Promise all of their problems
my problems *

22:17.036 --> 22:18.471
* I could always tell one thing
about 'em *

22:18.505 --> 22:20.673
* They hold me down
even when I'm at rock bottom *

22:20.707 --> 22:22.642
* Through it all, when I fall

22:22.675 --> 22:24.243
* They pick me up
like a phone call *

22:24.276 --> 22:25.712
* No pretend, all my kin

22:25.745 --> 22:27.514
* We going for the win
like a long ball. *

22:27.547 --> 22:28.515
(music ends)

22:28.548 --> 22:30.082
Okay.

22:30.116 --> 22:32.652
Um, one, can you not
do the stool like that?

22:32.685 --> 22:33.920
It makes you look pissed.

22:33.953 --> 22:36.255
And then also, you are
literally out of bounds.

22:36.288 --> 22:37.490
That's what all
this tape is for.

22:37.524 --> 22:38.491
You're, like,
in my balcony.

22:38.525 --> 22:41.661
Yo, this whole performance
is too soft.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.530
It needs
to command respect, Mal.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.498
Yo, why you sounding
like Lucious now?

22:45.532 --> 22:47.667
Hakeem, our performance
is tomorrow, okay?

22:47.700 --> 22:50.503
They're rearranging my entire
apartment, and we have a song.

22:50.537 --> 22:52.539
A dope song.
It is dope, but this verse,

22:52.572 --> 22:54.674
I need to use
to clap back to my haters.

22:54.707 --> 22:55.842
No, you should not.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.510
You know what, you're literally

22:57.544 --> 22:59.612
gonna stand your whole career
doing clap-back records.

22:59.646 --> 23:00.747
That's fine,
and I don't care,

23:00.780 --> 23:02.348
but do it
on someone else's track,

23:02.381 --> 23:04.116
'cause you're not gonna put
that B.S. on mine.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.718
We got terms
and conditions?

23:05.752 --> 23:07.186
If you had
enough followers,

23:07.219 --> 23:09.889
you'd be doing this on your own
channel, not Empire XStream.

23:09.922 --> 23:12.124
You know what, bro,
you about to piss me off.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.861
Bro, you're the one
that needs this, not me.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.897
You're the one
that's losing his fans, not me.

23:17.930 --> 23:20.266
Now, if it's gonna be
terms and conditions,

23:20.299 --> 23:22.602
just think about it--
it's mine.

23:22.635 --> 23:23.936
'Cause everybody knows

23:23.970 --> 23:25.672
this concert is life
or death for you.

23:26.973 --> 23:28.741
Just think about it.

23:37.784 --> 23:40.019
(thunder rumbling)

23:41.921 --> 23:43.623
Arms up.

23:43.656 --> 23:46.493
Hey, come on, man.
Hey, if I was packing,

23:46.526 --> 23:48.628
I would have violated
the terms of the sit-down.

23:48.661 --> 23:49.596
This is a violation.

23:49.629 --> 23:51.564
LUCIOUS: If I wanted
to violate you,

23:51.598 --> 23:54.300
Shine, you'd be getting
patted down with some bullets.

23:54.333 --> 23:55.802
Yeah. Is that right?

23:55.835 --> 23:57.236
Well, I got
four shooters outside

23:57.269 --> 23:58.337
that say you won't.

23:58.370 --> 23:59.606
LUCIOUS:
No, you got three.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.908
One stayed back
at a five-star hotel,

24:01.941 --> 24:05.812
where he's getting some room
service sent up by me right now.

24:05.845 --> 24:08.447
And if you like,
I can send your boys outside

24:08.481 --> 24:09.682
a snack, too.

24:09.716 --> 24:11.984
Don't forget I do this, Shine.
(scoffs)

24:12.018 --> 24:13.820
No, you don't do this, Lucious.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.187
I do this.

24:15.221 --> 24:17.189
You ain't did
this for years.

24:17.223 --> 24:19.759
You industry.
And I'm still in the streets.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.360
And if I got
to blow somebody up,

24:21.393 --> 24:23.162
I don't care if I die with him.

24:23.195 --> 24:25.331
But you already
know this.

24:25.364 --> 24:26.933
Look, maybe we got off

24:26.966 --> 24:28.701
on the wrong foot, huh?

24:28.735 --> 24:30.637
You want a drink
or something, man?

24:30.670 --> 24:32.138
No, I'm straight.

24:32.171 --> 24:34.006
'Cause we can talk tough
all night.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.776
But last time I checked,
we had something real good

24:36.809 --> 24:38.277
going with Nessa.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.379
Yeah, I thought so, too.

24:40.412 --> 24:42.448
That's until you and your son
tried to divide and conquer.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.816
You came at us first, man.

24:43.850 --> 24:44.984
(scoffs)
What is this?

24:45.017 --> 24:47.854
What are we doing?

24:47.887 --> 24:50.356
Come on, Lucious, it's me, bro.

24:50.389 --> 24:52.358
I could have buried
you a long time ago

24:52.391 --> 24:54.193
with any one of them
bodies you got.

24:54.226 --> 24:55.995
You forget Camden?

24:56.028 --> 24:57.463
Hold on, man.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.298
It's me you're
talking to.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.399
Calling me "bro,"

25:00.432 --> 25:02.034
and you're gonna bring
something like that up?

25:02.068 --> 25:04.804
Which I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.706
But if I did,

25:06.739 --> 25:09.175
that would be violating code
right here.

25:09.208 --> 25:10.710
Okay, you know what?

25:10.743 --> 25:12.244
This is a waste of my time.

25:12.278 --> 25:14.213
Come on, Nessa,
let's move.

25:14.246 --> 25:17.049
(chuckles): Shine. Hey, I
thought I heard you in here,

25:17.083 --> 25:19.218
waking up my baby.

25:19.251 --> 25:22.088
Look, Anika, we in the middle
of something right now.

25:22.121 --> 25:25.424
Oh, good. Did you tell him about
the idea that we discussed?

25:25.457 --> 25:26.759
My husband,

25:26.793 --> 25:28.728
just the other day,
he had just said

25:28.761 --> 25:31.230
how much he really appreciates
having you around here.

25:31.263 --> 25:32.999
You know, putting
your ear to Hakeem,

25:33.032 --> 25:34.533
bringing in Nessa.

25:34.567 --> 25:35.835
He even said that
it was such a shame

25:35.868 --> 25:39.271
that your talent had been
slept on all this time, and...

25:39.305 --> 25:41.407
imagine what you could do
with your own imprint.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.275
Right, babe?

25:43.309 --> 25:45.544
But, you know, I mean,
if you ever need somebody

25:45.578 --> 25:47.680
to bounce anything
off of, I'm here.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.716
Just let me know.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.753
Good to see you.

25:56.723 --> 25:59.692
Is that what you're offering,
Lucious?

25:59.726 --> 26:01.527
My own imprint?

26:01.560 --> 26:03.362
(chuckles): That's what
I was trying to get to

26:03.395 --> 26:07.734
when you came charging in like
King Kong or something, man.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.435
Is Nessa part of that deal?

26:09.468 --> 26:10.703
Look, Nessa's under

26:10.737 --> 26:13.439
a different contract
with Empire, but...

26:13.472 --> 26:15.441
we can cross-pollinate, man.

26:15.474 --> 26:17.877
What about Freda Gatz?

26:17.910 --> 26:19.478
I heard she out.

26:19.511 --> 26:21.113
I hear she's dope.

26:24.617 --> 26:29.155
Hey, if Freda gets it done
for you, she's all yours, bro.

26:29.188 --> 26:31.824
NESSA: Freda's
the one, Shine.

26:31.858 --> 26:34.593
And this could be
a good deal for you.

26:34.627 --> 26:36.462
Oh, for me, huh?

26:36.495 --> 26:38.798
For us, Shine.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.802
We got a deal.

26:42.835 --> 26:43.903
(thunder rumbling)

26:43.936 --> 26:46.939
(chuckles) Welcome
to the Empire, baby.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.945
Hey, you okay?
I barely got through,

26:52.979 --> 26:56.348
uh, last two meetings.

26:56.382 --> 26:58.818
You been talking
to my probation officer?

26:58.851 --> 27:00.987
Say what? No.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.155
Why would I do that?

27:03.189 --> 27:05.792
So, it's a total coincidence
that after I tell you

27:05.825 --> 27:08.194
I'm on supervised release,

27:08.227 --> 27:10.797
my P.O. starts
acting strict with me.

27:10.830 --> 27:13.132
No, I don't know nothing
about that. It's not me.

27:13.165 --> 27:15.802
Hmm. Then it must be because
you're running for mayor

27:15.835 --> 27:17.603
and you want
to keep me in check.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.172
(chuckles):
Oh, uh, okay, look,

27:20.206 --> 27:23.209
I don't make a habit of
keeping women in check.

27:23.242 --> 27:26.012
You must've got me confused
with your ex-husband.

27:26.045 --> 27:28.514
(laughs) Leave Lucious
out of this, man.

27:28.547 --> 27:29.882
Well, how can I?

27:29.916 --> 27:31.117
He's making sure

27:31.150 --> 27:33.519
he's very much a part of this.

27:33.552 --> 27:35.822
And what the hell is that
supposed to mean, Angelo?

27:35.855 --> 27:38.457
Cookie, look, I'm feeling you.
Okay, I know you know this.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.126
(chuckles):
But you and Lucious,

27:40.159 --> 27:42.729
y'all got some unresolved issues
you need to take care of.

27:42.762 --> 27:46.398
My only issue is being told
what issues I have.

27:46.432 --> 27:47.967
See, Angelo,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.036
you don't know me like that.
I don't. How can I?

27:50.069 --> 27:51.738
You don't let me.
Every time I try

27:51.771 --> 27:53.472
to get close to you,
you put a wall up.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.241
Aw, man...
See? Look,
there you go.

27:55.274 --> 27:56.575
I can't! What?
Okay.

27:56.608 --> 27:58.044
Uh, let's just
cut this night short,

27:58.077 --> 28:00.813
all right, 'cause we're both
getting reckless in the mouth...

28:00.847 --> 28:02.681
Yeah.
...and one of us is
gonna say something

28:02.715 --> 28:03.983
that we're gonna regret.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.084
Already did that.

28:06.786 --> 28:08.220
Good night, Cookie.

28:08.254 --> 28:09.756
Yeah, well, good night.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.926
Thank you.
Good luck.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.028
(sighs)

28:16.062 --> 28:17.396
(smacks lips)

28:17.429 --> 28:20.432
*

28:25.537 --> 28:28.040
* Where there is smoke

28:28.074 --> 28:30.676
* There is a fire

28:30.709 --> 28:32.578
* Burnin' my heart

28:32.611 --> 28:35.014
* Oh

28:35.047 --> 28:37.216
* If they only know

28:37.249 --> 28:39.451
* You're my desire

28:39.485 --> 28:44.023
* The world
would put an end to us *

28:44.056 --> 28:45.858
* I'll ride in the night

28:45.892 --> 28:48.527
* On the back of your bike

28:48.560 --> 28:53.065
* With my hands,
my hands to the sky *

28:53.099 --> 28:55.067
* So fast we could fly

28:55.101 --> 28:57.069
* Let's leave it behind...

28:57.103 --> 28:58.304
Okay, fine.
You're right, that's hot.

28:58.337 --> 28:59.438
I know.

28:59.471 --> 29:00.907
Yet you still disobeyed
a direct order,

29:00.940 --> 29:02.308
and you lied to Tiana.

29:02.341 --> 29:03.910
This ain't Chutes and Ladders.

29:03.943 --> 29:05.711
It's the music business.

29:05.744 --> 29:09.115
I thought you people understood
what the word "business" meant.

29:09.148 --> 29:11.117
You know,
Cookie is going to be pissed.

29:11.150 --> 29:14.053
I know. That's why I wanted you
to listen to the song first.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.088
You can help me convince Cookie
that this song is a hit.

29:16.122 --> 29:18.324
I don't know that it is a hit.
Yes, you do!

29:18.357 --> 29:19.892
The song is dope.
Listen to it.

29:19.926 --> 29:22.761
More importantly, it's
what the artist wants.

29:22.795 --> 29:24.763
All we have to do is
let Cookie hear it tomorrow.

29:24.797 --> 29:27.099
She'll love it,
and all will be forgiven.

29:27.133 --> 29:28.935
Listen to her.

29:28.968 --> 29:31.437
* Under starlight

29:31.470 --> 29:33.940
* So bright

29:33.973 --> 29:36.075
* Fast life

29:36.108 --> 29:38.477
* Tonight...

29:38.510 --> 29:40.079

29:40.112 --> 29:41.780
COOKIE:
Damn, boy!

29:41.814 --> 29:44.116
I'm-a give you the number
to my cleaning lady,

29:44.150 --> 29:46.919
because this place
is disgusting, Hakeem.

29:46.953 --> 29:49.155
I should've known you
would have ran to Mom.

29:49.188 --> 29:50.923
So much for being
a grown-up.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.158
Yeah, I played her
the song.

29:52.191 --> 29:54.360
Yes, and it's fire,
and you will do it

29:54.393 --> 29:56.929
the way you and Jamal
arranged it, end of story.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.597
How you gonna
make me?

29:58.630 --> 30:00.867
Why don't you stop
acting like a baby.
You the baby!

30:00.900 --> 30:02.869
You the baby, the dumb little
baby-- that's what you do.

30:02.902 --> 30:04.136
And you the semi-bald-
headed-looking baby.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.272
Shut up!

30:06.305 --> 30:09.275
Now, what did I have, two
boys or two little girls?

30:09.308 --> 30:12.178
'Cause y'all sound like
two sissies.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.946
(sighs)

30:13.980 --> 30:17.049
Now, what did I tell y'all way
back at that investor showcase?

30:17.083 --> 30:20.352
Hmm? What y'all not gonna
do is come in between

30:20.386 --> 30:21.954
me and my money.

30:21.988 --> 30:24.123
Now, it's been too long
since you and your brother

30:24.156 --> 30:25.624
performed in front of
the people.

30:25.657 --> 30:26.625
And that's what they want,

30:26.658 --> 30:28.027
and that's what
we will give them.

30:28.060 --> 30:29.795
Y'all just trying
to drag me

30:29.828 --> 30:31.630
into a fight y'all are
having with Lucious.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.165
Get your narrow ass
back up here, boy.

30:33.199 --> 30:35.034
Don't you ever walk away
from me.

30:38.037 --> 30:40.372
I'm trying
to stop one son

30:40.406 --> 30:43.009
from clapping back at an artist
that's not even on our label.

30:43.042 --> 30:44.043
Mm-hmm.

30:44.076 --> 30:45.411
Oh. And I'm only trying

30:45.444 --> 30:47.846
to help my other son
get back to performing

30:47.880 --> 30:49.581
in front of his fans
before they forget

30:49.615 --> 30:51.583
how much they love
his stupid ass.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.419
Mm-hmm.

COOKIE:
If you are afraid

30:55.121 --> 30:58.657
of getting on the wrong side
of your daddy...

30:58.690 --> 31:01.727
you don't want to get
on the wrong side of your mama.

31:01.760 --> 31:02.929
You feel me?

31:04.230 --> 31:06.665
I said,
do you feel me?

31:06.698 --> 31:08.134
Yeah, I feel you.

Good. Come here.

Hey, Ma...

31:16.408 --> 31:18.177
Clean this damn place up.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.112
Smelling like ass in here!

31:20.146 --> 31:22.248
Next time, take your shoes off
in my house, please.

31:22.281 --> 31:24.350
Shut up, Hakeem.
Boy, you better clean
this place up before

31:24.383 --> 31:26.818
I throw an acid bomb in here.
Nasty-ass pigsty.

31:32.258 --> 31:33.960
What's up, everybody?
It's your boy, Jamal Lyon.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.194
I want to say thank you so much
for tuning in.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.029
We are all the way live
on Empire XStream.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.030
That's my baby brother, Hakeem.

31:38.064 --> 31:41.233
We are here truly
for love and light.

So for all of y'all,
this is for you.

31:46.105 --> 31:49.976

to make it all right *

31:52.011 --> 31:55.047
* The front window shows
that our future's bright *

31:55.081 --> 31:57.483
* Together we stand,
divided we fall *

31:57.516 --> 32:00.652
* Building up the bridge and
we're tearing down the walls *

32:00.686 --> 32:03.055
* See, we done been
through the worse *

* If... we don't

32:10.129 --> 32:11.897
* Stand for something

32:11.930 --> 32:15.734
* Then we'll fall for anything

32:15.767 --> 32:19.405
* Blood is so much thicker

Anybody can perform
in the shower

32:51.170 --> 32:52.771
or in the middle of
his damn living room.

32:52.804 --> 32:53.939
Look at this.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.307
COOKIE: What are
those, the users?

32:55.341 --> 32:56.842
Looks like the numbers
are staying steady.

32:56.875 --> 32:58.277
Yeah, but they
need to go up.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.312
Hakeem's audience
ain't even tuning in

fire in here.

Okay, whatever, Lucious.
Get away from me.

33:07.386 --> 33:09.255
Okay.

33:12.358 --> 33:14.326
What happened to Gram, man?

33:14.360 --> 33:16.462
Lyons don't run from beef.
We crush that.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.364
I don't need to be beefing
over a chick who's my ex.

33:18.397 --> 33:19.998
Especially when
I'm about to have a new one.

33:20.032 --> 33:21.300
What?

33:21.333 --> 33:22.301
Nessa?

33:22.334 --> 33:24.203
HAKEEM: Yeah. We been
talking for a minute.

33:24.236 --> 33:25.737
I'm-a lock it

33:25.771 --> 33:28.207
Well, I hate to be the one
to break it to you,

33:28.240 --> 33:30.909
but your brother already
got that on lock.

33:30.942 --> 33:32.911
My brother?

33:32.944 --> 33:34.546
Not Jamal.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.348
Dre.

33:36.382 --> 33:37.716
Nah, Andre
wouldn't do that.

33:41.753 --> 33:43.155

33:43.189 --> 33:44.723
Man, you better
get your girl back.

33:46.258 --> 33:48.527
JAMAL:
Come on, brother.

33:48.560 --> 33:51.263

34:03.041 --> 34:05.111
* See, I always stayed down
for my bros *

34:05.144 --> 34:06.912

should be how it goes *

34:06.945 --> 34:08.780

but then we lost control *

34:08.814 --> 34:10.282
* When we hit some bumps
in the road *

34:10.316 --> 34:12.384
* Ask Andre, bet he knows

34:12.418 --> 34:14.052
* He was keeping secrets
on the low *

34:14.086 --> 34:15.787
* All them lies that you told

34:15.821 --> 34:17.123

34:19.791 --> 34:21.960

don't want to say nothin' *

34:21.993 --> 34:23.262
* Just wanna act
like a straight punk *

34:23.295 --> 34:25.030
* Plus Andre sick

34:25.063 --> 34:27.233
* Hold up, yeah, I told 'em
that I'll never let you *

34:27.266 --> 34:29.067
* Lean on my shoulder,
you know Nessa *

34:29.101 --> 34:30.402

I heard you had her *

34:30.436 --> 34:32.604
* Come and sleepin' over,
then Jamal *

34:32.638 --> 34:35.307
* Kept it quiet, what you
thought I wouldn't realize it? *

34:35.341 --> 34:36.975
Don't nobody care about
them damn numbers, Lucious.

34:37.008 --> 34:38.810
* And if you got a problem,
see about it *

34:38.844 --> 34:40.812
* Too busy kissing
your boyfriend *

34:40.846 --> 34:42.381
* You been dressing like a girl
since you were ten... *

34:42.414 --> 34:44.216
Oh, no, no, no! No!

34:44.250 --> 34:46.785
This is live, boy.
Whatever he's mad at,

34:46.818 --> 34:48.787
let him be mad, or it's
gonna get worse, okay?

34:48.820 --> 34:50.289
* I don't rock with
either one of you at all *

34:50.322 --> 34:51.557
* Sick, boy, yeah,
you sick, boy *

34:51.590 --> 34:53.425
* Lucious, let me know
you think you slick, boy *

34:53.459 --> 34:55.327
* You a has-been

34:55.361 --> 34:57.229
* And you both weak

34:57.263 --> 34:59.097
* Cash'll turn you
into a trick for it *

34:59.131 --> 35:01.167
* You'll probably even sleep
with a chick for it. *

What the hell was that, Hakeem?!
What the hell was that about?!

You got us doing
this Mickey Mouse performance

35:10.842 --> 35:12.311

35:12.344 --> 35:14.280

35:14.313 --> 35:15.581
What the hell
are you talking about?!

35:15.614 --> 35:16.982
Andre and Nessa!

35:17.015 --> 35:18.350
That's what I'm talking about!
NESSA: Hakeem,

35:18.384 --> 35:20.018
we could have talked about
this at a different time.

35:20.051 --> 35:21.353
You're trying to deny it?

35:21.387 --> 35:23.289
Calm down, okay? I didn't even
know you were into Nessa.

35:30.162 --> 35:31.297
You took it to another level,

35:31.330 --> 35:34.433
Wack-ass performance was
your idea in the first place!

35:34.466 --> 35:37.469
I shouldn't have
never listened to you.

35:37.503 --> 35:38.837
You just used me
to do a performance

35:38.870 --> 35:40.472
'cause you can't get out there
and do it yourself!

35:40.506 --> 35:43.275
Fake-ass wannabe MC!
I will kill you right...

35:43.309 --> 35:45.644
Shut your big ass up,

35:52.150 --> 35:53.385
Somebody plug this back in!

35:53.419 --> 35:55.487
You cannot just claim me,
Hakeem-- nothing happened!

35:55.521 --> 35:58.457
We didn't do that duet together?
We didn't vibe together?

35:58.490 --> 36:00.826
Oh my goodness,
a vibe, a vibe!
Shut up!

36:00.859 --> 36:02.494
Y'all, it's okay,
don't worry about it,

36:02.528 --> 36:04.330
'cause Hakeem Lyon,
he was just vibin'

36:04.363 --> 36:06.332

so it's all good.

36:06.365 --> 36:08.166
Turn these cameras off!
This is over! A wrap!

36:08.200 --> 36:09.501
Everybody out!

36:09.535 --> 36:10.869
Petty-ass dumb bitch!

36:10.902 --> 36:12.471
Shut your Frank Ocean
wannabe-ass up!

36:12.504 --> 36:14.373
You shut your fake-ass

Turn these cameras off!

36:19.778 --> 36:21.880
Hello, Becky.
Come in. Have a seat.

36:21.913 --> 36:24.650
So, uh, Tiana...

36:24.683 --> 36:26.485
unfortunately, there
was a miscommunication

36:26.518 --> 36:28.520
in your lead song, so...

36:28.554 --> 36:31.923
we're gonna have to postpone
the release of your album.

36:31.957 --> 36:34.159
No... What do you mean,
a miscommunication?

36:34.192 --> 36:37.329
Well, Xavier told me
that you recorded "Starlight"--

36:37.363 --> 36:39.064
which that is
lightweight snitchin',

36:39.097 --> 36:40.699
but we gonna deal
with that later.

36:40.732 --> 36:43.369
I did not sign off
on that song.

36:43.402 --> 36:45.437
So now we got to put you
back in the studio

36:45.471 --> 36:47.239
to record "Me,"
the song I wanted.

36:48.307 --> 36:50.276
So... you lied to me?

36:50.309 --> 36:51.777
No. I believed in the song.

36:51.810 --> 36:53.078
I can't work with
no liars, Cookie.

36:53.111 --> 36:54.513
I want her off my team.
What?

36:54.546 --> 36:55.514
Are you serious?

36:55.547 --> 36:57.115
I'm the only one
around here fighting for you.

36:57.148 --> 36:58.584
Yeah, and look where it got me.

36:58.617 --> 37:02.521
T... Cookie,
she's just mad right now.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.089
Please don't take me
off her team.

37:04.122 --> 37:05.357
You said it, Becky.

37:05.391 --> 37:07.559
We got to give the artist
what they want. Now...

37:07.593 --> 37:10.562
I can try and talk to her and
see if I can change her mind,

37:10.596 --> 37:12.130
but... you did this.

37:12.163 --> 37:13.765
You need to learn how to listen.

37:18.169 --> 37:20.306
What happened?
I thought you liked the song.

37:20.339 --> 37:21.473
I did.

37:21.507 --> 37:23.742
So why didn't you have my back?

37:24.776 --> 37:26.778
It's just business.

37:30.482 --> 37:32.984
(screams)

37:34.252 --> 37:36.588
There she is.
Cookie,

37:36.622 --> 37:38.390
I'd like to introduce you
to a good friend of mine,

37:38.424 --> 37:39.591
Gus Rodriguez.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.226
You know Ms. Davis.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.628
(chuckles):
Oh, so...

37:42.661 --> 37:44.430
it's like this now, huh, Angelo?

37:44.463 --> 37:46.264
I'm here to
apologize, Ms. Lyon.

37:46.298 --> 37:48.767
Ms. Lyon, Officer Davis
has been reprimanded

37:48.800 --> 37:50.802
for her overzealous
behavior.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.438
She hopes that
that will be sufficient,

37:52.471 --> 37:54.139
and you won't choose
to file a complaint.

37:54.172 --> 37:55.607
I'm not.

37:56.775 --> 37:59.077
Uh, what's going on here?

37:59.110 --> 38:00.579
RODRIGUEZ:
It seems that we got

38:00.612 --> 38:02.514
some wrong information
about an ongoing investigation

38:02.548 --> 38:05.083
that has nothing
to do with you.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.986
So who you saying told her
to put the squeeze on me?

38:08.019 --> 38:10.489
I'm not at liberty to say, but
you've been a model offender,

38:10.522 --> 38:13.592
and my office sees no reason
to extend your restrictions.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.594
I've known my man here
since we balled at Columbia.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.529
He says you're good people;
you're good with me.

38:17.563 --> 38:19.465
Okay.
I'll wait for you
out front.

38:19.498 --> 38:20.766
ANGELO:
All right, man, thanks.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.768
I'll see you
in three months, Hollo...

38:22.801 --> 38:24.102
Ms. Lyon.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.437
Give the kids my love, Sharlene.

38:25.471 --> 38:27.839
So you went to a lot
of trouble for me, huh?

38:27.873 --> 38:29.608
I saw your boys tonight

38:29.641 --> 38:32.544
on Empire XStream,
and, uh...

38:32.578 --> 38:34.880
I realized something
about you and your family.

38:34.913 --> 38:37.182
Yeah, I'm sure
the whole world did. (chuckles)

38:37.215 --> 38:40.652
Well, I realized
that... fighting

38:40.686 --> 38:42.320
is your family's
way of life.

38:42.354 --> 38:44.623
It's... it's like
it's in your blood.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.858
But somehow, y'all got
the idea that I'm...

38:46.892 --> 38:48.660
I'm not a fighter.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.829
Look, I am not trying
to fight with you right now.

38:50.862 --> 38:52.831
Baby girl, I'm
not talking about

38:52.864 --> 38:54.566
fighting with you...

38:54.600 --> 38:56.535
I'm talking about
fighting for you.

38:58.604 --> 39:01.473
And if that means going up
against Lucious, well...

39:01.507 --> 39:03.375
then so be it.

39:06.445 --> 39:07.679
Hmm.

39:07.713 --> 39:09.881
*

39:09.915 --> 39:11.817
TARIQ: You got me all the
way out in Brownsville.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.084
I hope you're
ready to talk.

39:13.118 --> 39:14.520
Yeah, I'm ready to talk.

39:14.553 --> 39:17.088
You ready to be about
that WITSEC life?

39:17.122 --> 39:18.323
(scoffs)

39:18.356 --> 39:20.692
WITSEC?
You must be smoking.

39:20.726 --> 39:22.594
You ain't gonna be walking
around in the sunshine

39:22.628 --> 39:24.029
after giving me a body.

39:24.062 --> 39:25.497
Even you ain't
that crazy, my G.

39:25.531 --> 39:26.698
What body?

39:26.732 --> 39:28.500
(chuckles) The one
you and Lucious hid

39:28.534 --> 39:31.670
in a slab of concrete
back in Camden.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.171
I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.673
You know what
I'm talking about.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.508
Look, I ain't the one
to be playing with, Shine.

39:36.542 --> 39:38.577
I'm squeezing the Lyon
family on all sides.

39:38.610 --> 39:41.680
Got Cookie's P.O. to tighten
the leash on her, and I can

39:41.713 --> 39:43.449
turn that same heat on
you anytime I want.

39:43.482 --> 39:46.852
That don't sound like gratitude,
Tariq.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.353
Especially when
I'm about to make

39:48.386 --> 39:49.455
Christmas come early for you.

39:51.122 --> 39:53.358
(door bell jingles)

39:53.391 --> 39:54.693
Who's that?

39:54.726 --> 39:56.895
That's Freda Gatz.

39:56.928 --> 39:59.531
The rapper that shot
Jamal Lyon at the ASAs?

39:59.565 --> 40:01.567
Exactly.

40:04.636 --> 40:06.972
SHINE:
Do you know who her dad was?

40:07.005 --> 40:08.907
Remember Frank Gathers?
Of course
I remember Frank.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.542
You, Lucious
and Cookie,

40:10.576 --> 40:12.644
you used to run material
for him back in the day.

40:12.678 --> 40:14.112
Allegedly.

40:14.145 --> 40:16.081
More importantly,
you know her father

40:16.114 --> 40:17.949
was locked up with Lucious
at the BCC.

40:17.983 --> 40:20.586
You know,
he got killed up there.

40:20.619 --> 40:22.320
Now, I can't tell

40:22.353 --> 40:24.923
if it was a coincidence or...
or what.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.792
I don't know.

40:26.825 --> 40:29.728
So you saying Lucious had
something to do with it?

40:29.761 --> 40:31.329
Nah, that's not
what I'm saying.

40:31.362 --> 40:33.098
Actually, I ain't
saying nothing.

40:33.131 --> 40:35.834
I'm just taking my dog for
a walk through the neighborhood.

40:38.837 --> 40:41.172
*

40:44.610 --> 40:47.579
I know what you was up to in
that meeting with Shine today.

40:47.613 --> 40:49.781
I ain't mad
at you, though.

40:49.815 --> 40:52.450
It was a good idea.

40:52.484 --> 40:54.352
Well, when it comes
to good ideas,

40:54.385 --> 40:56.588
let's just say I
learned from the best.

40:56.622 --> 40:57.789
(chuckles)

40:57.823 --> 41:00.325
Nah, I'm just glad
I could help.

41:00.358 --> 41:02.160
(sighs)

41:02.193 --> 41:06.798
I could continue being
a help, you know.

41:06.832 --> 41:08.433
Shine's gonna need an A&R.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.802
(chuckles) Look at you.

41:10.836 --> 41:12.337
Trying to get something
for yourself

41:12.370 --> 41:13.639
out of this
whole thing.

41:13.672 --> 41:15.440
I'm just saying.
Yeah.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.175
I'll think about it,
all right?

41:19.177 --> 41:21.680
Look, let me talk
to my boy for a minute.

41:21.713 --> 41:22.814
Okay.

41:25.083 --> 41:27.786
(sighs)

41:27.819 --> 41:29.788
I'm-a place her
right on your chest.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.623
She's so tiny, I think
I'm gonna break her.

41:31.657 --> 41:32.991
Nah, don't worry.

41:33.024 --> 41:35.694
Just trust yourself.

41:35.727 --> 41:37.362
Right there.

41:37.395 --> 41:40.632
Make sure her head
is nice and relaxed.

41:40.666 --> 41:42.834
You were right, Dad.

41:42.868 --> 41:44.970
Yeah.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.405
I wasn't gonna let you
get punked like that.

41:47.438 --> 41:48.707
And if that means
you got to

41:48.740 --> 41:50.075
go to war with
your brothers, then...

41:50.108 --> 41:51.677
so be it.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.211
You were right about Jamal, too.

41:53.244 --> 41:54.245
Yeah, I know.

41:54.279 --> 41:55.714
(sighs)

41:55.747 --> 41:57.048
So this means
I don't have to

41:57.082 --> 41:58.684
play tug-of-war
with you no more?

41:58.717 --> 42:00.719
I wasn't trying to do that.

42:02.220 --> 42:04.656
You want what's right
for Bella, right?

42:04.690 --> 42:06.992
Want to set
the world up for her.

42:07.025 --> 42:09.828
But I need to find myself again,
musically.

42:09.861 --> 42:12.230
But things are just so tense
with Shine right now.

42:12.263 --> 42:15.500
Ah, don't worry about him.
I took care of that.

42:15.533 --> 42:16.835
Look at her.

42:16.868 --> 42:18.536
Sound asleep in your arms.

42:18.570 --> 42:20.405
(chuckles softly)

42:20.438 --> 42:23.041
It's the first time she's
not screaming in my arms.

42:23.074 --> 42:24.275
Know why?

42:24.309 --> 42:27.545
You got your swagger back.

42:29.047 --> 42:30.281
Come on.

42:30.315 --> 42:32.684
Let's put her down
over here.

42:32.718 --> 42:34.285
When you swaddle a baby,

42:34.319 --> 42:36.722
you want to bend down
the top of the corner

42:36.755 --> 42:38.690
like you're making
a nice "V."

42:38.724 --> 42:41.059
Then you put her head,
the top of her head,

42:41.092 --> 42:44.462
right there, right there,
at the top of that.

42:44.495 --> 42:45.764
Okay.
You got it.

42:45.797 --> 42:48.433
She trusts you.

42:48.466 --> 42:50.736
Yeah, support
that neck.

42:50.769 --> 42:51.803
I got you.
Oh...

42:51.837 --> 42:53.371
Oh, little baby.

42:53.404 --> 42:54.372
(fusses)

42:54.405 --> 42:56.474
Oh, you got it,

42:56.507 --> 42:57.743
you got it, you got it.

42:57.776 --> 42:59.477
She's good, she's good.

42:59.510 --> 43:00.679
All right. (sighs)

43:02.113 --> 43:04.149
Let's talk about
this music of yours.

43:04.182 --> 43:07.452
I have some thoughts about

43:07.485 --> 43:09.254
who you should
and shouldn't be working with.

43:09.287 --> 43:11.556
And, yeah, you should do
some songs with Shine,

43:11.589 --> 43:13.725
but not all of 'em.

43:13.759 --> 43:16.662
Maybe I'll produce you again.

43:16.695 --> 43:19.898
Turn you into
a destroyer of souls.

43:29.775 --> 43:33.779

what this number is?

44:13.819 --> 44:16.187
-Last night's winning Lotto.
-The number of cats
in your apartment.

44:16.221 --> 44:21.026
It's the amount of money
you two cost the city
working together for three days.

44:21.059 --> 44:23.661
You've been on the job 25 years.
Not a nick on you.

You get partnered with Riggs
