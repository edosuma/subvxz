WEBVTT

00:06.083 --> 00:08.791
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:34.708 --> 00:35.750
Marghe?

01:08.958 --> 01:10.708
Where were you? I was looking for you.

01:11.583 --> 01:12.833
At the agency.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.041
I had a client who kept me late.
He wouldn't leave.

01:17.625 --> 01:20.208
You could've let me know.
I was getting worried.

01:21.333 --> 01:23.375
You're right. Sorry. I couldn't answer.

01:23.458 --> 01:28.250
And then you know how it is,
Eva left me some calls to make, and…

01:28.333 --> 01:29.250
So I'm late.

01:29.333 --> 01:30.625
Dinner's ready.

01:35.833 --> 01:37.083
I'll just get changed.

01:46.625 --> 01:47.666
<i>I have to go.</i>

01:54.666 --> 01:55.583
Do you have to?

02:10.375 --> 02:11.500
Everything okay?

02:14.958 --> 02:15.875
Yeah.

02:17.041 --> 02:18.750
I'm just a bit tired.

02:52.916 --> 02:54.041
Listen, Marghe.

02:54.125 --> 02:57.250
Some clients interested
in the Concordia place called.

02:57.750 --> 03:00.125
They say it's just what they need.

03:01.541 --> 03:02.958
I stalled.

03:03.041 --> 03:04.208
Thank you.

03:05.125 --> 03:07.833
I know this stalemate can't last forever.

03:07.916 --> 03:10.166
You aren't ready to make an offer yet?

03:10.250 --> 03:11.375
Yes.

03:11.458 --> 03:15.291
It just also depends on Carlo's novel.
I don't know where that stands.

03:16.916 --> 03:19.833
You guys communicate wonderfully, huh?

03:20.958 --> 03:21.916
Yeah.

03:29.708 --> 03:32.750
What I mean is,
if you and Carlo are having issues,

03:32.833 --> 03:36.208
maybe it's best to forget the apartment,
focus on you two.

03:36.291 --> 03:39.416
You need to talk.
If he's not talking, you should.

03:40.041 --> 03:43.083
Above all, Marghe,
don't hide anything from him.

03:43.166 --> 03:45.583
Not if you want him to do the same.

03:45.666 --> 03:46.750
Sure.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.291
Future Home, this is Eva. How can I help?

03:56.541 --> 03:58.666
<i>Tomorrow will be a day like no other.</i>

03:58.750 --> 04:01.958
You'll meet some very important
writers and publishers,

04:02.041 --> 04:04.041
then there'll be a party.

04:07.125 --> 04:09.541
-But you'll stay sober.
-No!

04:09.625 --> 04:11.333
Stay sober, trust me.

04:11.416 --> 04:14.333
Let the others, the publishers drink.

04:14.416 --> 04:18.166
Encourage them to do so
if you want to hear the magic words

04:18.250 --> 04:20.000
"send me some pages."

04:20.541 --> 04:23.250
Make sure you seize the opportunity.
Have a good day.

04:33.416 --> 04:35.416
-Hey.
-Hi.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.708
-How's it going?
-Everything's fine.

04:38.625 --> 04:40.458
Are you writing the story?

04:40.541 --> 04:42.666
Yes, I think I broke the ice.

04:42.750 --> 04:43.750
Great.

04:45.625 --> 04:47.583
-Goodbye, Prof.
-Goodbye.

04:48.083 --> 04:49.083
-Bye.
-Bye.

05:18.125 --> 05:19.625
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:26.250 --> 05:27.333
Had dinner yet?

05:29.458 --> 05:32.291
Yes, today is a good day.
I can't stop writing.

05:35.375 --> 05:36.625
Hey. Kiss.

05:47.958 --> 05:48.958
Thank you.

05:56.666 --> 05:58.125
Fancy going out later?

06:02.125 --> 06:02.958
I…

06:04.791 --> 06:07.041
I want to focus on the book tonight.

06:07.625 --> 06:08.458
Do you mind?

06:09.208 --> 06:10.166
No, no problem.

06:11.791 --> 06:15.375
The symposium is tomorrow
so I wanted to get ahead.

07:01.125 --> 07:04.791
ANDREA
I HOPE I DIDN'T GET YOU IN ANY TROUBLE

07:08.916 --> 07:12.041
MARGHERITA
NO, YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

07:20.083 --> 07:26.166
I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ANYMORE

07:30.083 --> 07:36.833
ANDREA
DO YOU WANT TO HANG OUT AGAIN?

08:44.750 --> 08:45.958
Good morning!

09:11.791 --> 09:15.208
"ALL LITERATURE IS AN ASSAULT
ON THE FRONTIER."

09:42.916 --> 09:45.458
You wanted to come in, and you came in.

10:10.875 --> 10:11.833
Good morning.

10:17.125 --> 10:18.125
What time is it?

10:19.083 --> 10:20.166
It's late.

10:20.250 --> 10:21.625
I let you sleep in.

10:21.708 --> 10:24.000
-You're already working hard?
-Yes.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.416
I need to figure out
what to keep and what to throw away.

10:32.916 --> 10:34.291
Did you have a nightmare?

10:36.625 --> 10:37.583
What?

10:38.166 --> 10:40.875
Just before you woke up,
you shouted, "Fuck!"

10:45.166 --> 10:46.000
Yeah.

10:46.625 --> 10:47.625
Yeah, I…

10:48.625 --> 10:50.333
I had a sort of nightmare.

10:52.083 --> 10:53.083
What about you?

10:54.041 --> 10:55.250
How did you sleep?

10:56.208 --> 10:57.083
So-so.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.750
It's not so easy without you.

11:08.416 --> 11:09.458
Hey, look.

11:11.750 --> 11:13.500
My notes from university.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.583
I used to draw too.

11:18.958 --> 11:19.958
How silly.

11:25.500 --> 11:26.458
Want a hand?

11:26.541 --> 11:27.750
No, it's fine.

11:27.833 --> 11:29.083
There's a lot of stuff.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.208
It's my stuff.

11:32.500 --> 11:35.041
I thought we could
spend some time together.

11:35.625 --> 11:37.875
Sometimes I need my space too.

11:47.083 --> 11:49.041
Okay. I'll go out, then.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.000
Come on, Carlo. Don't be offended.

11:51.958 --> 11:53.000
I'm not offended.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.375
Aren't you going to take a shower?

11:59.666 --> 12:00.666
It's broken.

12:35.666 --> 12:36.833
THE MEMORY OF A WONDERFUL DAY!

12:40.791 --> 12:43.125
THE DAY OF MY GRADUATION!

12:49.833 --> 12:51.708
MILAN POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY

12:51.791 --> 12:54.000
MASTER'S DEGREE
WITH HONORS IN ARCHITECTURE

13:56.166 --> 13:58.458
I bought the tracks for the shower door.

13:59.583 --> 14:00.750
I can fix it now.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.583
Yeah.

14:03.666 --> 14:05.000
What's wrong?

14:08.166 --> 14:09.208
What are those?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.250
Love notes.

14:14.666 --> 14:15.958
Between my father

14:16.750 --> 14:17.875
and another woman.

14:19.000 --> 14:19.916
Franco?

14:22.208 --> 14:23.125
Franco.

14:25.916 --> 14:28.541
Well, maybe they were just friends.

14:29.666 --> 14:31.583
They wrote to each other for years, Carlo.

14:32.833 --> 14:34.375
They were having an affair.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.791
My father was having an affair…

14:39.958 --> 14:41.125
and I didn't know.

14:44.125 --> 14:45.125
I'm sorry.

14:48.541 --> 14:50.583
What should I do? Do I tell my mother?

14:51.083 --> 14:52.916
It was so long ago.

14:53.708 --> 14:54.916
Your father's gone.

14:56.458 --> 14:57.750
Maybe it's best not to.

15:00.750 --> 15:02.500
Doesn't she have the right to know?

15:06.041 --> 15:07.875
Why don't we go out? Huh?

15:07.958 --> 15:09.666
You've been stuck at home all day.

15:13.125 --> 15:14.041
Yeah.

15:26.333 --> 15:27.791
If only it were that easy.

15:28.375 --> 15:29.958
I'm not saying it's easy.

15:32.250 --> 15:33.083
Hi.

15:33.791 --> 15:34.625
Hi.

15:34.708 --> 15:36.791
-You guys staying for dinner?
-Yes.

15:36.875 --> 15:38.583
Shall we get a table?

15:38.666 --> 15:39.750
No, stay with us.

15:39.833 --> 15:41.875
-No…
-We didn't want to disturb you.

15:41.958 --> 15:44.916
What? Don't be silly.
I'll get you a drink.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.083
Beppe, can you get me
two glasses of red wine, please? Great.

15:50.208 --> 15:51.541
So, how's it going?

15:52.333 --> 15:54.625
Giulia and I were just having a chat.

15:54.708 --> 15:56.958
We were remembering our first date.

15:57.583 --> 15:58.708
What was yours like?

15:58.791 --> 16:00.750
Thai restaurant.

16:00.833 --> 16:03.375
I asked Marghe what she liked,
and she said,

16:03.875 --> 16:04.708
"Ethnic."

16:04.791 --> 16:08.500
So I decided to play it safe
and book at a Thai restaurant.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.208
-Did he guess right?
-Not at all.

16:12.291 --> 16:14.791
But I lied and said it was my favorite.

16:15.625 --> 16:17.291
I'm just finding that out now.

16:17.375 --> 16:20.791
You're fabulous. You always manage
to find out something about each other.

16:21.375 --> 16:23.583
Not always something positive.

16:23.666 --> 16:24.833
True. One-nil.

16:24.916 --> 16:28.250
I just wanted to say
you're the best couple I know, okay?

16:28.333 --> 16:29.541
We came here,

16:29.625 --> 16:32.416
and now it's ours.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.666
I bought it for us.

16:36.000 --> 16:36.916
Two-nil.

16:37.875 --> 16:39.375
That day,

16:39.458 --> 16:42.291
we went to a Cezanne exhibition.

16:43.750 --> 16:46.375
It was our first date, so to win her over,

16:46.458 --> 16:50.041
I had to pretend I knew
all about his paintings.

16:50.125 --> 16:52.083
-I knew straight away.
-That I was clueless?

16:52.166 --> 16:53.333
Absolutely.

16:53.416 --> 16:56.291
But I made him go
to all the exhibitions anyway

16:56.916 --> 16:58.958
to see how much he cared about me.

17:00.083 --> 17:02.583
No, that was just
a cruel exercise of power

17:02.666 --> 17:05.791
of a cynical woman
who always does what she wants.

17:07.083 --> 17:07.958
Three-nil.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.833
You're right. I'm cynical.

17:10.916 --> 17:13.333
Or maybe I was cynical?

17:13.416 --> 17:15.625
But then, after the mistake I made,

17:16.833 --> 17:21.041
I realized that cynicism
is nothing but a slightly chicer way

17:22.416 --> 17:24.333
to declare yourself a loser.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.083
Three-one?

17:30.500 --> 17:32.125
Yes, I think that's three-one.

17:32.208 --> 17:33.958
Let's toast. A comeback is possible!

17:34.041 --> 17:35.458
Come on, you can do it!

17:40.916 --> 17:43.541
I bet those two have some things
to talk about now.

17:48.083 --> 17:50.875
I'm sorry you couldn't
take your mind off things.

17:51.708 --> 17:53.250
It wasn't the right night.

17:54.083 --> 17:57.333
Hard to get your mind off things
when everything is falling apart.

17:57.958 --> 18:00.041
Come on, Marghe. Don't overdo it.

18:00.125 --> 18:04.125
Franco and Anna spent their life together.
They figured out a way to be happy.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.333
Yes, without ever being honest.

18:06.833 --> 18:09.583
What do we know of their truth?

18:12.416 --> 18:14.708
I really can't do this anymore, Carlo.

18:14.791 --> 18:17.416
I can't pretend that everything is okay,

18:17.500 --> 18:20.041
and we're the best couple
in the world, and...

18:20.125 --> 18:22.916
-What's that got to do with it?
-You do what you want. And I…

18:23.458 --> 18:24.291
And you?

18:24.375 --> 18:25.375
You what?

18:26.000 --> 18:28.458
For five years,
I've thought only about you.

18:29.375 --> 18:33.375
"Will he be able to write his book?
Will he have enough space to work?"

18:33.458 --> 18:36.541
"What can I do to help him?
Will he feel comfortable?"

18:36.625 --> 18:41.125
My dreams, my ambitions, my plans,
they've all taken a backseat.

18:41.208 --> 18:42.958
Then I wake up one morning

18:43.041 --> 18:46.000
and find that a 20-year-old girl
has taken my place on your mind.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.125
-Not this again.
-Without doing anything!

18:48.208 --> 18:52.375
-No 20-year-old girl has taken your place!
-Enough! Admit it!

18:52.458 --> 18:53.833
Know what the truth is?

18:54.916 --> 18:57.833
You're still mad at me
for that fucking misunderstanding.

18:57.916 --> 18:59.333
I can't take it anymore!

18:59.416 --> 19:02.125
It's not all about you, Carlo.
Get that into your head.

19:02.208 --> 19:05.333
You're fucking selfish,
self-referencing, self-centered,

19:05.416 --> 19:07.041
any word starting  with "self"!

19:07.125 --> 19:08.708
You find it. You're the writer!

19:10.750 --> 19:12.500
The real misunderstanding
is between us.

19:36.166 --> 19:37.125
Here he is!

19:38.083 --> 19:39.750
Come to see some real writers?

19:39.833 --> 19:41.500
The faculty's full of them today.

19:41.583 --> 19:45.416
Come on, Luca, stop. I don't need
a lecture from you. I'll buy you a coffee.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.625
I've already had five.
In the absence of better drugs…

19:48.708 --> 19:50.291
Fuck, my wallet!

19:50.375 --> 19:52.875
I don't believe it.
Don't you have a better excuse?

19:52.958 --> 19:54.125
Go on, buy me one.

19:54.625 --> 19:58.041
I'm having a rough time.
My head's all over the place.

19:58.125 --> 20:00.708
Actually, you do look
like shit, my friend.

20:00.791 --> 20:03.125
I've slept on the sofa for two nights.

20:03.208 --> 20:04.958
Was that your decision or Marghe's?

20:05.041 --> 20:05.875
Drop it.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.625
But I did do some writing.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.666
Good!

20:09.750 --> 20:11.958
Maybe you needed to have some issues.

20:12.041 --> 20:14.083
Maybe you created the issues
so you could write.

20:14.166 --> 20:16.125
You're a shrink now?

20:16.208 --> 20:18.291
What is it, a new pick-up tactic?

20:19.166 --> 20:20.250
My friend,

20:20.750 --> 20:22.375
I'd like to give you a tip,

20:22.458 --> 20:23.791
but what do I know?

20:23.875 --> 20:27.250
For me, wives are just something
other people have.

20:28.541 --> 20:29.583
When are you talking?

20:29.666 --> 20:31.375
In an hour. In classroom 19.

20:32.166 --> 20:34.166
Let's go see
who's stealing the show today.

20:35.708 --> 20:37.666
You want to see the award-winner?

20:38.166 --> 20:39.125
Come with me.

20:40.708 --> 20:41.875
Desire…

20:42.625 --> 20:46.208
My magnificent, shameless desire...

20:46.291 --> 20:48.666
I think that is what has led me
through the streets of life

20:48.750 --> 20:50.041
and through the pages.

20:50.666 --> 20:53.375
A desire to get away
from preestablished patterns,

20:53.458 --> 20:57.375
a desire to take new paths.

20:58.208 --> 21:01.166
-I don't know where it comes from.
-Look at him.

21:01.250 --> 21:04.083
The hotshot who sold two million copies.

21:04.583 --> 21:06.708
-He writes well though, the bastard.
-Yeah.

21:06.791 --> 21:08.958
My grandpa would take me out of school.

21:09.041 --> 21:11.958
He'd go pass my elementary school,

21:12.041 --> 21:15.875
taking me to the beach or the park,
instead of the school desks.

21:19.291 --> 21:21.458
You're right. Who could forget her?

21:21.541 --> 21:23.666
-Come on.
-She's a masterpiece.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.208
…I'm coming to desire.

21:27.166 --> 21:30.333
I love this rhetoric,
the rhetoric of desire.

21:44.416 --> 21:47.000
-All right, Carlo. See you later.
-See you.

21:51.291 --> 21:53.333
-Goodbye, Prof.
-Goodbye.

21:54.625 --> 21:56.625
Yes, but make sure you stay sober.

21:56.708 --> 21:58.916
-Nice shirt.
-Thank you.

22:03.958 --> 22:07.125
<i>My friend,</i>
<i>culture doesn't put bread on the table.</i>

22:08.416 --> 22:11.958
-Won't all this fruit make you ill?
-No, because… Excuse me.

22:14.708 --> 22:17.500
There we go, just as it was getting good.
Please watch out for culture.

22:17.583 --> 22:19.083
Hello? Yes.

22:20.291 --> 22:22.083
Hey. Hi. What's up?

22:23.666 --> 22:28.250
I was saying that we can postpone
the Bacan course, the seminar,

22:28.333 --> 22:30.833
and do the one on pottery first.

22:30.916 --> 22:32.916
-What do you think?
-Totally agree.

22:33.000 --> 22:33.833
Good!

22:33.916 --> 22:35.500
-Hey.
-<i>Hey.</i>

22:35.583 --> 22:36.958
<i>Hi, honey. How are you?</i>

22:37.958 --> 22:39.041
Fine. You?

22:39.125 --> 22:40.375
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

22:40.458 --> 22:42.208
<i>The room is almost ready.</i>

22:42.291 --> 22:44.291
<i>Your father would've gone mad</i>
<i>if he were here.</i>

22:44.875 --> 22:47.625
Yes, he wanted everything his own way.

22:47.708 --> 22:50.041
<i>I don't want to bother you.</i>
<i>It's dinner time.</i>

22:50.125 --> 22:53.083
No, you aren't bothering me.
I'm home alone anyway.

22:53.166 --> 22:54.750
<i>Oh. So where's Carlo?</i>

22:55.291 --> 22:57.125
At the symposium at the university.

22:57.875 --> 23:00.583
There's a party or something like that.

23:01.083 --> 23:02.833
<i>And you're just moping around?</i>

23:02.916 --> 23:04.958
<i>Come on, get up off that sofa!</i>

23:05.750 --> 23:07.500
How do you know I'm on the sofa?

23:08.625 --> 23:10.833
<i>Listen, go and surprise him.</i>

23:12.416 --> 23:13.250
We'll see.

23:43.375 --> 23:44.666
Gin and tonic, please.

24:03.583 --> 24:04.625
-Voilà.
-Thank you.

24:37.250 --> 24:40.500
SOFIA
YOU DANCING?

24:49.375 --> 24:50.875
CARLO
ME AND YOU DANCING

24:50.958 --> 24:54.041
WHILE EVERYONE'S WATCHING?

25:37.500 --> 25:40.750
This is my third cocktail, Prof.
I won't be in class tomorrow.

25:40.833 --> 25:42.041
Good idea!

25:44.000 --> 25:45.375
-Are you having fun?
-Yes.

25:45.458 --> 25:46.583
Come dance with us.

25:47.208 --> 25:48.250
Bye, Prof.!

26:16.041 --> 26:18.291
Listen, Leo, can you leave me alone?

26:18.375 --> 26:20.416
-I have to leave you alone?
-Yes! Go away!

26:20.500 --> 26:22.333
-I have to leave?
-Come on. Go away!

26:22.416 --> 26:24.125
-Bye.
-Fuck you.

26:37.666 --> 26:39.583
We're here. That's 20 euros.

26:45.041 --> 26:46.125
Is everything okay?

26:50.083 --> 26:51.083
Shall we go?

26:53.500 --> 26:54.375
Yes.

27:04.291 --> 27:06.250
<i>Are you sure this is the right address?</i>

27:07.583 --> 27:09.666
That's what the GPS says.

27:15.041 --> 27:17.000
No, it's okay. I'll get out here.

27:19.916 --> 27:20.833
Thank you.

27:31.833 --> 27:34.833
I didn't realize that you liked him
until I saw you together.

27:36.208 --> 27:38.125
You haven't realized lots of things.

27:39.208 --> 27:41.958
I think you only see what you want to see.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.375
You were trying to provoke me?

27:50.541 --> 27:52.125
But I didn't manage to.

27:54.458 --> 27:56.208
No, you managed very well.

28:04.541 --> 28:06.250
-Where are you going?
-Come!

28:13.125 --> 28:15.000
Sofia, what are you doing?
You can't go in!

28:18.625 --> 28:20.083
There's CCTV everywhere!

28:21.083 --> 28:22.291
Stay outside then.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.875
Go on! Punch him in the chest!

29:16.625 --> 29:18.250
-Go on!
-Dodge!

29:21.583 --> 29:22.458
Go on!

29:22.541 --> 29:24.208
Come on! Go!

29:24.958 --> 29:26.166
-Go on!
-Come on!

29:26.750 --> 29:27.583
Finish him!

29:41.375 --> 29:43.833
Come on! Go for it!

30:05.250 --> 30:06.375
Boo!

30:09.958 --> 30:12.458
Why do you and I always end up in a park?

30:13.708 --> 30:15.541
Yes, and always at the same point.

30:18.583 --> 30:20.416
Where did you have your first kiss?

30:22.625 --> 30:23.625
I don't know.

30:25.291 --> 30:26.333
I don't remember.

30:26.416 --> 30:27.583
I was on a slide.

30:28.958 --> 30:32.458
I was in 6th grade.
I can't remember the boy's name.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.583
The classic middle school love.

30:36.083 --> 30:38.291
-I've never been in love.
-Come on!

30:40.458 --> 30:42.000
It's not easy for me.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.250
It isn't easy for anyone.

30:46.333 --> 30:47.625
It's harder for me.

30:48.708 --> 30:50.041
I can't trust anyone.

30:52.166 --> 30:53.791
Even you, at first.

30:57.250 --> 30:58.083
And then…

31:00.750 --> 31:01.666
"And then"?

31:07.333 --> 31:08.750
Some kind of miracle.

31:45.375 --> 31:46.375
You came.

31:52.125 --> 31:53.500
Didn't expect that, huh?

31:55.166 --> 31:58.000
When you gave me the address,
I was thinking more

31:58.958 --> 32:00.583
of a restaurant or a bar.

32:01.291 --> 32:02.958
Something like that.

32:03.041 --> 32:04.458
That's usually the case.

32:07.375 --> 32:08.291
Shall we go?

32:09.250 --> 32:10.583
Where, the hospital?

32:11.791 --> 32:13.291
It's just a scratch.

32:14.875 --> 32:15.875
Come on.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.500
Are you sure you're okay?

32:19.541 --> 32:20.375
I'm okay.

32:23.083 --> 32:25.083
Okay, but forget the bike.

32:25.666 --> 32:26.666
We'll get a taxi.

32:29.291 --> 32:31.208
You still don't trust me, huh?

32:53.958 --> 32:55.625
Do we want the same thing?

33:00.375 --> 33:01.458
You don't?

33:02.041 --> 33:03.125
I can't.

33:06.458 --> 33:07.750
Not the way I'd like to.

33:10.041 --> 33:13.541
Take this. It's my story.
I wanted to give it to you today.

33:15.875 --> 33:17.791
I can't stay in Milan with you.

33:18.708 --> 33:20.958
I'm leaving,
and this time I won't turn back.

33:32.791 --> 33:35.666

POLICE

34:12.625 --> 34:14.125
What were you doing in the park?

34:16.708 --> 34:17.708
I was taking a walk.

34:19.208 --> 34:20.375
You were taking a walk.

34:22.250 --> 34:23.208
ID.

34:24.375 --> 34:25.666
I don't have it.
