00:38.358 --> 00:42.486
<i>Emerald, my kingdom for the emerald</i>

00:42.487 --> 00:49.034
<i>For the Topkapi emerald,
oh, hallelujah</i>

01:35.957 --> 01:41.795
It can be done.
That's the way it can be done.

01:41.796 --> 01:45.632
Oh! Oh, excuse me.

01:45.633 --> 01:48.594
I've just had a great idea.

01:48.595 --> 01:54.516
Something I've been looking for
a long time. A very long time.

01:54.517 --> 01:58.645
Josef, how many times have you
been in and out of the country?

01:58.646 --> 02:00.731
Many times, many times.

02:00.732 --> 02:04.276
I should say... Yes, 12 times.

02:04.277 --> 02:07.070
Ever had a problem at
the border, at customs?

02:07.071 --> 02:09.656
- Bah! They know me.
- Josef,

02:09.657 --> 02:12.743
you're going to be very rich.
Do you like that?

02:12.744 --> 02:14.494
I like that.

02:14.495 --> 02:18.165
It will be some time before
I see you again, Josef.

02:18.416 --> 02:21.502
I will wait for you.

02:47.070 --> 02:49.363
This is...

02:49.364 --> 02:52.574
You don't even know
who I am, or where I am.

02:52.575 --> 02:57.955
First, my name is not really Elizabeth
Lipp, but please call me that.

02:57.956 --> 02:59.873
It's convenient.

02:59.874 --> 03:03.585
And I am in Turkey...
in Istanbul... in the seraglio.

03:03.586 --> 03:06.129
This is where the old sultans lived.

03:06.130 --> 03:08.632
They had a lot of wives
and other treasures,

03:08.633 --> 03:12.177
so they made the palace
bigger and bigger.

03:12.178 --> 03:15.013
Like each of the buildings here,

03:15.014 --> 03:20.143
this little shack contains works
of art unique in the world.

03:20.144 --> 03:26.316
The entire seraglio is now a museum...
the fabulous Topkapi Museum.

03:26.317 --> 03:31.488
But... but there is one special room.

03:31.489 --> 03:36.410
That's why I'm here. I'll show you.

03:48.256 --> 03:50.800
Come in.

03:53.261 --> 03:58.890
This cradle... pearls, rubies,
and pure, solid gold.

03:58.891 --> 04:03.270
This is the famous
throne of Shah Ismael.

04:03.271 --> 04:08.275
No king or emperor ever sat
on a throne more precious.

04:08.276 --> 04:13.430
From every corner of the earth...
gifts made to the Turkish empire.

04:13.431 --> 04:18.498
But I would give you all of them...

04:18.499 --> 04:21.370
for just one dagger,

04:21.372 --> 04:26.168
encrusted with diamonds and emeralds.

04:26.169 --> 04:31.132
The four greatest emeralds
the world has ever known.

04:32.508 --> 04:34.676
Dazzling.

04:34.677 --> 04:37.220
Flawless.

04:37.221 --> 04:41.183
All four are priceless.

04:41.184 --> 04:45.104
But there is one that is perfection.

04:45.396 --> 04:51.277
It has life. It is warm.
It has nerves, senses...

04:53.029 --> 04:55.948
Oh, forgive me.

04:55.949 --> 05:00.160
A strange thing happens to me.

05:00.161 --> 05:03.581
Difficult to explain.

05:05.959 --> 05:08.586
All right.

05:12.173 --> 05:14.800
I'm going to have it.

05:14.801 --> 05:18.179
It's going to be mine.

05:19.430 --> 05:21.974
How?

05:21.975 --> 05:25.311
I didn't finish introducing myself.

05:27.021 --> 05:29.356
I am a thief.

05:29.357 --> 05:32.318
Honest.

06:41.262 --> 06:45.223
Excusez-moi, monsieur l'agent,
ou est l'Hôtel George V?

06:45.224 --> 06:48.644
Vous descendez les Champs Élysées
et vous prenez l'avenue George V.

06:48.645 --> 06:50.896
- Merci.
- A votre santé, monsieur.

06:50.897 --> 06:53.649
Merci, monsieur l'agent.

06:55.902 --> 06:58.446
Taxi!

07:15.213 --> 07:17.506
A gun is one thing,

07:17.507 --> 07:19.758
intelligence is another.

07:19.759 --> 07:22.970
Since I'm more afraid
of intelligence...

07:22.971 --> 07:26.724
Hôtel George V. Here.

07:31.938 --> 07:35.316
Up to your old tricks, Walter?

07:36.651 --> 07:40.112
Hello, Elizabeth.

07:44.284 --> 07:48.745
- What brings you here?
- That old magnetism. I was drawn to you.

07:48.746 --> 07:52.207
It took three years to get
that old magnetism to work.

07:52.208 --> 07:54.293
- How's the captain?
- Hm?

07:54.294 --> 07:57.254
My successor.

07:57.255 --> 08:01.258
It took three days for the
magnetism to wear off.

08:01.259 --> 08:03.594
Seriously?

08:03.595 --> 08:06.054
Seriously.

08:06.055 --> 08:08.599
- Cannibal.
- It's like Chinese food.

08:08.600 --> 08:12.103
One hour, and you're hungry again.

08:12.604 --> 08:16.232
- What do you want?
- You.

08:17.483 --> 08:21.904
- Business? Pleasure?
- So many questions.

08:21.905 --> 08:24.698
Let's go and eat. I am hungry.

08:25.283 --> 08:29.453
- Where?
- My studio.

08:29.454 --> 08:32.748
- Still the same?
- Slight change.

08:43.676 --> 08:46.595
You've lost none of your skill.

08:46.596 --> 08:51.433
- Darling, you too.
- I was talking seriously.

08:51.434 --> 08:54.186
- I, too.
- You're never serious,

08:54.187 --> 08:56.563
except when it comes
to stealing emeralds.

08:56.564 --> 08:58.815
It's a living.

08:58.816 --> 09:01.569
Well?

09:08.034 --> 09:10.578
It's too tough.

09:12.288 --> 09:14.915
But I'll do it.

09:17.335 --> 09:20.087
- I knew you would.
- On one condition.

09:20.088 --> 09:22.089
- Granted.
- I pick the crew.

09:22.090 --> 09:24.549
- As always.
- Not as always.

09:24.550 --> 09:28.012
This time, with amateurs.

09:30.848 --> 09:34.143
- Amateurs?
- Only amateurs.

09:34.727 --> 09:39.231
- All right, I give up.
- My favourite pupil.

09:39.691 --> 09:41.984
Sit down.

09:41.985 --> 09:46.572
Lesson one... the three
cardinal rules of theft.

09:46.573 --> 09:49.616
How Swiss you are. Eins, zwei, drei.

09:49.617 --> 09:53.829
You're right. Eins...
plan meticulously.

09:53.830 --> 09:57.416
- Zwei... execute...
- Cleanly.

09:57.417 --> 10:00.335
- Drei?
- Don't get caught before, during...

10:00.336 --> 10:04.881
Or after. That's right.
The Istanbul emeralds...

10:04.882 --> 10:09.094
the most protected jewels in
the world... have been stolen.

10:09.095 --> 10:13.015
Alarm system.

10:13.016 --> 10:16.310
Check Cedric Page, London.

10:17.228 --> 10:20.063
Cedric Page? What's that?

10:20.064 --> 10:22.733
You will meet him.

10:22.734 --> 10:27.946
Now, the emeralds are gone.
Policemen of the world unite.

10:27.947 --> 10:30.866
You're Scotland Yard, Turkish police...
what do you do?

10:30.867 --> 10:33.660
- What do I do?
- You eliminate the riffraff.

10:33.661 --> 10:36.330
Obviously, this is a class job.

10:36.331 --> 10:40.918
You dig out the dossiers on the
top professionals, the elite.

10:40.919 --> 10:47.007
How many are they? Not more
than half a dozen, and all known.

10:47.008 --> 10:50.594
But, there is no dossier
on Elizabeth Lipp...

10:50.595 --> 10:56.100
not even Elizavetta Lippmanova...
because you have been lucky.

10:57.060 --> 11:02.231
There's no dossier on Walter Harper...
not even Walter Haberlee...

11:02.232 --> 11:04.191
because I have been efficient.

11:04.192 --> 11:06.985
- What you would call "Swiss".
- Liebling.

11:06.986 --> 11:11.407
So there must be no police record
on anyone who works with us.

11:11.824 --> 11:15.035
Where do you find these
lily-white innocents?

11:15.036 --> 11:17.287
That's my job.

11:17.288 --> 11:20.374
What do you say?

11:20.375 --> 11:22.918
Amateurs?

11:26.089 --> 11:28.632
Amateurs.

11:33.304 --> 11:35.389
Ah.

11:49.445 --> 11:52.155
He has many children, Cedric Page?

11:52.156 --> 11:55.785
None. These are all his own toys.

11:57.495 --> 12:00.998
- Come, look at this parrot.
- I don't like parrots.

12:00.999 --> 12:02.583
This one isn't real.

12:02.584 --> 12:06.045
I'm beginning to wonder
if anything is real.

12:08.590 --> 12:12.175
I'm beginning to wonder
if anything is real.

12:12.176 --> 12:15.345
Well you may, dear lady.
Like the old faith healer of Deal

12:15.346 --> 12:17.514
who said, "Although pain isn't real,

12:17.515 --> 12:20.475
when I sit on a pin and
it punctures my skin,

12:20.476 --> 12:23.312
I dislike what I fancy I feel."

12:23.313 --> 12:28.191
I'm Cedric Page. How nice of you to
come, Walter, and to bring Miss Lipp.

12:28.192 --> 12:31.194
I see you've met my recording Polly.
Amusing, isn't she?

12:31.195 --> 12:34.573
Oh, very. I hope it won't
record all our conversations.

12:34.574 --> 12:38.368
Polly is the soul of discretion.
I never go anywhere without her.

12:38.369 --> 12:40.621
Well, shall we move into my den?

12:40.622 --> 12:43.499
We'll be more private in there.

12:44.626 --> 12:47.169
Come along, Miss Lipp.

12:49.380 --> 12:52.007
My newest toy.
It doesn't work with a ray.

12:52.008 --> 12:54.259
Just the smallest
change of temperature,

12:54.260 --> 12:58.138
the natural heat of the human body,
close enough to it does the trick.

12:58.139 --> 13:00.515
If you had a refrigerated
dress, it wouldn't work!

13:00.516 --> 13:07.523
Fortunately, I haven't. I very seldom
wear one, especially not in England.

13:12.445 --> 13:15.614
Make yourselves comfortable.

13:24.582 --> 13:27.793
The entertainment is charming.

13:28.211 --> 13:31.713
- Is it all for me?
- I'm a terrible show-off.

13:31.714 --> 13:34.884
But do let me offer you a drink.

13:40.390 --> 13:43.225
- No, thank you.
- How was your trip to Istanbul?

13:43.226 --> 13:45.894
Marvellous! Did you go on
the underground railway?

13:45.895 --> 13:47.688
It's the oldest in Europe.

13:47.689 --> 13:50.816
Did you bother to go to
the museum, Mr Page?

13:50.817 --> 13:54.278
Well, of course. That was the
whole idea, wasn't it? The alarm.

13:54.279 --> 13:57.990
I take my responsibilities in
this enterprise seriously,

13:57.991 --> 13:59.992
as I'm sure you do, Miss Lipp.

13:59.993 --> 14:05.039
Well, now, let's all go
into the museum, shall we?

14:06.124 --> 14:09.001
Here is the door, shall we say?

14:09.002 --> 14:16.842
And Walter... Walter is
the sultan... with the dagger.

14:16.843 --> 14:19.511
Miss Lipp?

14:25.727 --> 14:29.021
It was you weight that did it,
on the Treasury floor.

14:29.022 --> 14:31.648
Perhaps I should have said,
"Even your weight".

14:31.649 --> 14:34.402
Try again, just one foot.

14:36.988 --> 14:39.532
Well, just the toe.

14:43.036 --> 14:45.871
It's all based on a
little chap down here.

14:47.957 --> 14:50.250
This is a delicate strain gauge.

14:50.251 --> 14:52.753
There are hundreds of
them under the Treasury,

14:52.754 --> 14:56.173
each one connected
to the alarm system.

14:56.174 --> 14:59.134
They measure weight...
the smallest weight.

14:59.135 --> 15:01.470
Even a ping pong ball.

15:07.060 --> 15:09.228
That's our problem.

15:09.229 --> 15:12.898
Then all you have to do is to
find the switch and turn it off.

15:12.899 --> 15:15.901
It could be anywhere,
hidden in the walls or the ceiling,

15:15.902 --> 15:19.154
operated by remote control
a mile away or more.

15:19.155 --> 15:24.868
And how do you propose to get into
a museum without touching the floor?

15:24.869 --> 15:27.996
I wouldn't have to touch
the floor if I were a fly.

15:27.997 --> 15:32.042
It isn't how I see you, Mr Page.

15:32.752 --> 15:35.045
We have our human fly.

15:35.046 --> 15:37.715
And our human fly holder.

15:39.175 --> 15:42.344
- That's Giulio, that's Hans.
- And...

15:47.684 --> 15:50.102
..we have a sucker!

15:50.103 --> 15:52.312
A sucker?

15:52.313 --> 15:55.232
Yes. You'll catch on.

15:55.233 --> 16:00.862
And we need another kind of sucker,
but him we'll find in the north of Greece.

16:00.863 --> 16:05.826
In Kavala, near the Turkish border.

16:19.591 --> 16:23.177
- Yianis, give me my money.
- Tomorrow.

16:28.725 --> 16:32.895
- Young one. No money. Nothing.
- And no groups aboard there?

16:32.896 --> 16:35.939
- Some English.
- English? Open that bag.

16:35.940 --> 16:38.734
Let's have the box. Come on.

16:38.735 --> 16:41.737
Where is it? Oh, ah, there we go.

16:41.738 --> 16:45.240
Yes, the English lay great
store by things like this.

16:45.241 --> 16:50.120
I hate to do it myself but,
c'est la vie!

16:50.121 --> 16:54.333
Well, wish me luck, Voula.

16:55.209 --> 16:57.753
Ah, Simpson!

17:00.632 --> 17:02.424
So that's Arthur Simpson.

17:02.425 --> 17:06.846
Arthur Simon Simpson...
historian, guide, and schmo.

17:08.598 --> 17:10.723
Morning. First time
in Kavala, no doubt.

17:10.724 --> 17:13.477
I'm Arthur Simpson,
archaeologist and historian.

17:13.478 --> 17:16.438
I dug this up many...
Look, it's still wet.

17:16.439 --> 17:18.941
This harbour's full of
historical connections.

17:18.942 --> 17:21.484
Brutus spent the night
here before Philippi,

17:21.486 --> 17:25.989
after that unpleasant business he had
with Shakespeare... Julius Caesar.

17:25.990 --> 17:28.575
Viens, chérie.

17:28.576 --> 17:31.662
Je parle Belgique...

17:33.039 --> 17:37.709
Ceramics, handmade by the
descendants of ancient heroes here.

17:37.710 --> 17:39.962
Ah, Reverend!

17:39.963 --> 17:42.297
My name is Simpson, sir.
Arthur Simpson.

17:42.298 --> 17:46.218
I'm Church of England myself.
It's a very religious place.

17:46.219 --> 17:49.721
Do you know St Paul passed through
here on his way to Samothrace?

17:49.722 --> 17:52.140
I do.

17:52.141 --> 17:58.439
You'd be surprised to know the
amount of people that don't, Bishop.

17:59.065 --> 18:06.113
Mack, want to see the nightlife of Kavala?
You want the belly dancers, stripteasers?

18:06.114 --> 18:10.326
You showed me Kavala
nightlife. Remember?

18:14.455 --> 18:16.999
- I'm not expensive...
- No.

18:27.802 --> 18:30.178
- Look work of art!
- I don't want any.

18:30.179 --> 18:34.183
- Only 10 drachma.
- Go to Hell!

18:47.697 --> 18:50.533
Nothing.

18:58.917 --> 19:01.543
- Do I look like a tourist?
- A hustler's dream.

19:01.544 --> 19:03.754
I like the touch of the parasol.

19:03.755 --> 19:06.298
- Genius!
- Come, sucker.

19:07.008 --> 19:10.052
- Genuine antique?
- Oh, madam has a very keen eye.

19:10.053 --> 19:15.182
No, it's an imitation, but of a period
about 1000 BC. But I've got other things.

19:15.183 --> 19:19.144
I'm Arthur Simpson, the uncrowned
king of Kavala nightlife.

19:19.145 --> 19:22.606
- I've got some Minoan cuff links...
- Thank you!

19:23.524 --> 19:26.735
I've got some Hellenistic
ones of the ninth dynasty...

19:26.736 --> 19:29.196
- Hey!
- What? You want me, sir?

19:29.197 --> 19:33.868
Come to the yacht club after lunch.
Might have a little job for you.

19:34.535 --> 19:37.496
Yes, sir.

19:41.209 --> 19:44.419
Hello, Voula. Voula my doll.

19:44.420 --> 19:48.465
I smell hard currency.
Take the plate.

19:48.466 --> 19:51.843
Off home now, girl, and iron the tie.

19:51.844 --> 19:54.054
- Ah, Simpson!
- Oh, yes, yes.

19:54.055 --> 19:57.182
I know, I know, I know.

19:57.183 --> 20:00.186
You wicked thing, you.

20:21.165 --> 20:23.709
Here comes the schmo.

20:27.463 --> 20:30.549
I'm sorry I'm late. I ran into
an old friend... archaeologist.

20:30.550 --> 20:33.677
- We used to run an art publication.
- Simpson,

20:33.678 --> 20:36.263
- how'd you like to earn a fast buck?
- Sir?

20:36.264 --> 20:39.474
100 bucks, to be precise.
But if you are not interested...

20:39.475 --> 20:42.019
- I am, sir.
- You live here?

20:42.020 --> 20:44.980
Yes, well, while my own place
up there is being done up,

20:44.981 --> 20:48.483
I'm right down... right down there.

20:48.484 --> 20:50.986
You see that Lincoln?

20:52.238 --> 20:54.656
Don't see many of
them in Kavala, sir.

20:54.657 --> 20:58.076
It's been rented by a friend to
take to Turkey. He's going by sea.

20:58.077 --> 21:01.121
- Do you know Istanbul?
- Turkey, oh, yes. Istanbul, yes.

21:01.122 --> 21:06.418
Good. Here's what you will do. Take
the car to the Hilton Hotel, Istanbul.

21:06.419 --> 21:11.590
- Your papers and licence in order?
- Oh yes, Mr... Yes, sir.

21:11.591 --> 21:14.551
Here is the car key.
Leave it with the hotel porter.

21:14.552 --> 21:19.640
Tell him the car is for Mr Plimpton.
Got it? Plimp-ton. P-l-i-m-p...

21:19.641 --> 21:21.558
P-t-o-n. Tes.

21:21.559 --> 21:25.103
They'll want the papers at the border.
They're in the glove department.

21:25.104 --> 21:27.272
Glove department. Yes, sir.

21:27.273 --> 21:29.650
Just one more little thing, Simpson.

21:29.651 --> 21:32.986
This car is worth over $13,000.

21:32.987 --> 21:36.031
If I don't hear from Mr
Plimpton by 5 o'clock tomorrow,

21:36.032 --> 21:38.742
I'll report to the
police here. Understood?

21:38.743 --> 21:41.578
That was uncalled for, sir.

21:41.579 --> 21:43.872
Mr Simpson can be relied on.

21:43.873 --> 21:46.751
He has a very reliable face.

21:47.126 --> 21:49.670
- Thank you, Mrs...
- Miss.

21:50.171 --> 21:52.715
Oh!

21:54.384 --> 21:59.429
- Bon voyage, Mr Simpson.
- Godspeed, Arthur Simpson.

21:59.430 --> 22:04.184
Walter, suppose they really
search the car at the border.

22:04.185 --> 22:05.936
It could happen.

22:05.937 --> 22:08.272
- Suppose they find...
- Finders keepers.

22:08.273 --> 22:12.067
- What about Simpson?
- I'm afraid they will keep him, too.

22:12.068 --> 22:15.445
- They'll ask him about us.
- So? Who is us?

22:15.446 --> 22:18.740
We didn't rent the car,
Plimpton did, and he doesn't exist.

22:29.961 --> 22:32.713
All our plans, all our hopes,

22:32.714 --> 22:37.009
riding in the car with that...
what did you call him?

22:37.010 --> 22:39.929
Schmo.

22:42.056 --> 22:43.933
Schmo.

22:55.028 --> 22:58.030
<i>Istanbul, I love you.</i>

23:04.162 --> 23:06.664
Uh-oh.

23:31.147 --> 23:33.482
- Morning.
- Passport.

23:50.917 --> 23:53.544
Morning. Mind if I watch?

24:14.315 --> 24:16.567
- Mr Arthur Simpson?
- Mr Simpson, yes.

24:20.989 --> 24:23.282
There's nothing wrong there, I hope.

24:23.283 --> 24:25.701
- You are English?
- Oh, yes.

24:25.702 --> 24:28.078
Then why you have Egyptian passport?

24:28.079 --> 24:31.373
That's a long story. My father
was a British officer... a colonel.

24:31.374 --> 24:34.626
- Then why not a British passport?
- I'm coming to that.

24:34.627 --> 24:37.045
Mummy... my mother...
she was Egyptian.

24:37.046 --> 24:40.007
In fact, I was born
over there, in Egypt.

24:40.008 --> 24:44.845
Cairo. Which is in... Egypt.

24:44.846 --> 24:46.305
Yes?

24:46.306 --> 24:49.600
Well, there was some trouble
with the marriage documents.

24:49.601 --> 24:53.437
Troop movements. You gentlemen
know what it's like in the army.

24:53.438 --> 24:56.773
- I know how it is in the army.
- Yes. The army, yes.

24:56.774 --> 24:59.651
Mr Simpson,
this passport is not good.

24:59.652 --> 25:02.821
It expired nearly three weeks ago.

25:02.822 --> 25:04.990
This?

25:04.991 --> 25:07.576
I'll tell you what, as soon
as we get to Istanbul...

25:07.577 --> 25:11.038
I'm sorry, Mr Simpson.
You must go back to Greece.

25:13.291 --> 25:15.543
Uh...

25:21.591 --> 25:24.760
I do not speak Arabic.

25:24.761 --> 25:26.929
Uh, officer? Officer?

25:26.930 --> 25:29.514
May I have your ear
for a moment, please?

25:29.515 --> 25:32.059
Now, you misunderstand entirely.

25:32.060 --> 25:35.395
I thought that the Turks
were a hospitable people.

25:35.396 --> 25:39.066
I know somebody who is going to have
something to say about this... me!

25:39.067 --> 25:41.736
And another thing. I...

25:59.587 --> 26:01.755
- Be careful!
- Don't!

26:10.056 --> 26:13.141
- Mefkufsunuz.
- Mefkufsunuz?

26:13.142 --> 26:17.855
- What does that mean?
- That means you're under arrest!

26:19.274 --> 26:21.817
Mefkufsunuz.

26:33.621 --> 26:37.041
- Uh...
- You will speak when spoken to!

27:07.697 --> 27:10.908
- When did you join the Sigma group?
- Me?

27:10.909 --> 27:13.368
- Who recruited you?
- Nobody.

27:13.369 --> 27:15.871
- So you volunteered.
- No, no, please.

27:15.872 --> 27:20.792
- I was hired to drive, to...
- Who else did the man and woman see?

27:20.793 --> 27:22.252
I don't know.

27:22.253 --> 27:24.546
- Did they send other arms out of Greece?
- No.

27:24.547 --> 27:25.881
- Did they tell you?
- No.

27:25.882 --> 27:28.342
- Then how do you know?
- I don't know...

27:28.343 --> 27:32.721
- Why did you lie?
- I did not lie. I mean...

27:33.223 --> 27:36.517
Simpson, be careful.

27:38.228 --> 27:41.897
I am a victim of circumstances.

27:41.898 --> 27:44.107
Ci...

27:44.108 --> 27:46.694
I swear it.

27:47.445 --> 27:51.615
Look here, I think it's time
you took me to my embassy.

27:51.616 --> 27:56.370
- You can... you can call...
- Call which embassy?

27:58.623 --> 28:02.960
I doubt the Egyptian authorities will
issue a passport to Arthur Simpson.

28:02.961 --> 28:05.128
It seems there is a dossier.

28:05.129 --> 28:09.466
The Egyptians bear me a grudge,
sir, because I claim to be British.

28:09.467 --> 28:14.471
In 1958, he was deported from Britain
for smuggling pornographic literature.

28:14.472 --> 28:16.974
An art magazine, sir.

28:16.975 --> 28:19.309
Called...

28:19.310 --> 28:23.355
Stop Press Nudes.

28:25.233 --> 28:29.236
But may I remind you gentlemen
that not so very long ago,

28:29.237 --> 28:34.366
James Joyce and even Lady Chatterley
herself were considered obscene.

28:34.367 --> 28:37.995
Simpson, the penalty
for terrorism is death.

28:49.173 --> 28:52.593
Were you going to use the roof of
the Hilton? One of the balconies?

28:52.594 --> 28:54.261
Balconies? What for?

28:54.262 --> 28:56.430
Where would you use
the smoke grenade?

28:56.431 --> 28:59.516
Are they for your accomplices,
to create confusion?

28:59.517 --> 29:02.477
Accomplices? I don't know.

29:02.478 --> 29:06.148
Simpson, you're aware next Tuesday
is our annual Army Day parade?

29:06.149 --> 29:10.652
I swear on the life of my fa...
of my mother.

29:10.653 --> 29:14.156
You know our chiefs of staff
and the foreign military missions

29:14.157 --> 29:16.658
will be together on the grandstand?

29:16.659 --> 29:19.077
Their safety is our responsibility.

29:19.078 --> 29:24.417
We shall be merciless with anyone
who threatens it. Merciless.

29:30.715 --> 29:35.802
You frighten me, sir, but after
all, that's part of your job.

29:35.803 --> 29:41.975
But if my father could hear you
now, he'd laugh himself sick.

29:41.976 --> 29:44.102
He wasn't no colonel, sir.

29:44.103 --> 29:48.815
I just said that in order to make
myself seem important, you know.

29:48.816 --> 29:53.779
He was a sergeant. Acting sergeant.
Acting, unpaid sergeant.

29:53.780 --> 29:57.699
Do you know what he used to say?
He used to say, "Arthur,

29:57.700 --> 30:02.287
Arthur, you're a carbuncle
on the behind of humanity."

30:02.288 --> 30:05.540
Carbuncle. I'm a nothing!

30:05.541 --> 30:08.543
I'm a nobody! Me, with a gun?

30:08.544 --> 30:12.464
Me, up on the roof?
I don't like heights, sir.

30:12.465 --> 30:15.426
I get very dizzy. Honestly.

30:16.803 --> 30:20.806
I don't know what you're up to, sir,
but I can see it from your face.

30:20.807 --> 30:24.393
You don't think that I'm a terrorist?

30:28.982 --> 30:31.149
All right.

30:31.150 --> 30:34.653
I will give you a chance to prove it.

30:35.071 --> 30:38.031
You will work for us.

30:38.032 --> 30:40.325
I can't do that, sir.

30:40.326 --> 30:45.664
- If they were to find out, they'd kill me.
- You will not let them find out.

30:49.502 --> 30:52.546
Mefkufsunuz.

30:59.012 --> 31:02.639
The arms are back in the car,
just as they were.

31:02.640 --> 31:07.227
The chances are they won't be touched
until the evening before Army Day,

31:07.228 --> 31:09.438
but you will check them constantly.

31:09.439 --> 31:12.858
If they have been touched,
you will report at once.

31:12.859 --> 31:15.193
- What's the matter?
- I feel dizzy. Uh...

31:15.194 --> 31:17.780
This is for your messages.

31:19.908 --> 31:22.701
Cigarettes.

31:22.702 --> 31:25.871
Be always sure to have an empty pack.

31:25.872 --> 31:30.125
Put your messages there,
and drop them from the car.

31:30.126 --> 31:33.795
That car will follow you everywhere.

31:33.796 --> 31:37.007
They will pick them
up wherever you go.

31:37.008 --> 31:40.302
Most important,
report everything you overhear.

31:40.303 --> 31:43.639
Everything, no matter how
trivial it may seem to you.

31:43.640 --> 31:47.226
One word could tell us
whom they work for.

31:47.227 --> 31:50.103
- Yes, sir.
- Remember our briefing for the Hilton?

31:50.104 --> 31:51.897
Hilton? Oh, yes.

31:51.898 --> 31:54.942
If you betray us,
we will know. Understand?

31:54.943 --> 31:57.778
- Yes.
- OK.

32:01.407 --> 32:05.244
Courage, Simpson. You are now
an agent of Turkish Security.

32:05.245 --> 32:09.206
- Off you go.
- Oh, well, you can rely on me, sir.

32:12.543 --> 32:14.670
Stop!

34:30.889 --> 34:34.810
I've come. I've got the documents
for Mr Plimpton's car here.

34:34.811 --> 34:36.853
- Any mail for Mr Barlow?
- No.

34:36.853 --> 34:39.481
- Thank you.
- Mr Plimpton? Is he staying here?

34:39.482 --> 34:42.693
I was supposed to deliver them
here for Mr Barlow... Plimpton.

34:42.694 --> 34:45.404
- I will give it to him when he comes.
- Thank you.

34:45.405 --> 34:48.031
I've been waiting for my
telegram for three weeks.

34:48.032 --> 34:51.702
It must be here somewhere!

34:51.703 --> 34:56.206
It isn't possible. When my aunt
says she sends a telegram,

34:56.206 --> 34:58.166
she sends a telegram.

34:58.167 --> 35:00.752
Was that the driver
of Mr Plimpton's car?

35:00.753 --> 35:03.672
- Yes. Do you want me to stop him?
- No, I'll catch him up.

35:03.673 --> 35:06.341
I have been coming for three weeks.

35:06.342 --> 35:09.511
Mr Plimpton, I'm the lad who
drove your car from Kavala.

35:09.512 --> 35:12.472
She's a beautiful machine.
She really will motor.

35:12.473 --> 35:14.474
- Thank you.
- Uh, um...

35:14.475 --> 35:16.977
I suppose you want
some remuneration.

35:16.978 --> 35:19.938
- Oh, the gasoline, sir.
- You mean the petrol.

35:19.939 --> 35:22.232
Oh, I thought you
might be an American.

35:22.233 --> 35:23.859
No.

35:23.860 --> 35:28.280
Well, that will be $46, sir,
calculating the drachma at 29.7 and...

35:28.281 --> 35:30.949
There. Have a pleasant
journey back to Greece.

35:30.950 --> 35:35.496
Oh, Greece, yes.
The home of Homer, of...

35:36.664 --> 35:40.209
- Oh, thank you very much, Mr...
- Goodbye.

35:50.011 --> 35:52.387
I'm sorry, I don't speak
a word of Turkish.

35:52.388 --> 35:56.183
- You'll have to ask somebody else.
- Please to show your car papers.

35:56.184 --> 35:59.728
My car papers? Why didn't you say so?

35:59.729 --> 36:03.857
- You are Mrs Plimpton?
- Of course I'm not Mrs Plimpton.

36:03.858 --> 36:07.611
- Effendi.
- That's all right. I'm not offended.

36:08.196 --> 36:12.241
- Is not you who bring car into country?
- No. There's a driver.

36:12.742 --> 36:18.121
Oh. Turkish law says only gentleman
who bring car or Mrs Plimpton may drive.

36:18.122 --> 36:23.710
- I didn't know that. Now the driver's gone.
- You may not drive this car.

36:23.711 --> 36:25.671
What do you expect me to do?

36:25.672 --> 36:30.050
- You are not Mrs Plimpton.
- I know that. There is the driver. Driver!

36:30.051 --> 36:33.512
- Driver!
- Called me, sir?

36:33.513 --> 36:36.515
Come here a moment, will you?

36:56.744 --> 37:00.289
Why don't you get rid of that
drunken cook? Makes me crazy.

37:00.290 --> 37:02.833
He goes with the villa.
Learn to live with him.

37:10.216 --> 37:14.095
What's the matter? What's the matter?

37:14.429 --> 37:18.765
In my country, cooks cook,
no shervish table.

37:18.766 --> 37:22.185
Shervish people shervish table.
Blurry foreigns.

37:22.186 --> 37:24.813
Put the tray down and get out.

37:24.814 --> 37:27.473
Get out or I'll break your neck!

37:30.862 --> 37:33.405
OK.

37:35.325 --> 37:37.410
Ah, pig.

37:38.411 --> 37:41.372
Easy, Hans.

37:43.207 --> 37:47.752
I've told you, one servant is
already one servant too many.

37:48.253 --> 37:52.507
For poor Hans, too.
Come on, maybe you'll beat me.

37:52.508 --> 37:55.219
- There's always a first time.
- I played backgammon...

37:55.220 --> 37:59.181
- Not backgammon, tavli.
- What's the difference?

37:59.182 --> 38:01.600
The difference between
you and the Turks.

38:01.601 --> 38:04.979
It's their game. Backgammon.

38:12.737 --> 38:16.823
He doesn't need speech.
He talks with his whole body.

38:16.824 --> 38:20.453
- His body talks too much.
- Play.

38:31.130 --> 38:33.841
Cedric is here with the car.

38:41.558 --> 38:44.101
Somebody's with him.

38:44.894 --> 38:47.229
Who is it, Giulio?

38:47.230 --> 38:50.857
- He's brought Simpson. Why?
- Damn! What can we do with him here?

38:50.858 --> 38:54.361
You wouldn't take the car in,
would you? Sit down.

38:55.488 --> 38:58.907
Ah, Cedric, you have picked
up Plimpton's car, good man.

38:58.908 --> 39:02.869
Forgive us, we began tea without you.
You've brought Simpson with you.

39:02.870 --> 39:06.665
How nice to see you, Mr Simpson.
An unexpected pleasure.

39:06.666 --> 39:09.459
- Nothing wrong, I hope?
- No, no, but...

39:09.460 --> 39:13.171
I say, I'm afraid we've run
foul of the Turkish law.

39:13.172 --> 39:15.299
They threatened to take the car away.

39:15.300 --> 39:20.262
Only Plimpton or Simpson's allowed to
drive it, or take it out of the country.

39:20.263 --> 39:23.557
How silly of Plimpton
not to have known.

39:23.558 --> 39:28.270
- No other misadventures, Simpson?
- Apart from the customs.

39:31.190 --> 39:33.859
Poor Mr Simpson.
Did they search the car?

39:33.860 --> 39:36.570
Took the seats out, underneath...

39:37.113 --> 39:39.948
Did they find my
heroin and marijuana?

39:39.949 --> 39:42.326
No. Tou hid those too well.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.413
We'll take advantage
of your being here.

39:46.414 --> 39:49.333
Take us sightseeing
until Mr Plimpton arrives.

39:49.334 --> 39:55.255
Hans, take Simpson to the kitchen and
see that he gets fed and has a room.

39:55.256 --> 39:57.800
Come on.

39:59.802 --> 40:03.513
- Bon appétit, Mr Simpson.
- Don't overdo it.

40:03.514 --> 40:06.892
He scared me to death.

40:14.859 --> 40:17.402
- You are foreign not?
- Oh, no. I'm English.

40:17.403 --> 40:20.614
Oh, you OK.

40:21.532 --> 40:25.661
Yeah, you good man,
like the King Victoria.

40:26.621 --> 40:30.666
I say, those people out
there, they're tourists?

40:30.667 --> 40:32.918
Huh? Ha!

40:33.378 --> 40:36.756
- Aren't they?
- Take.

40:42.220 --> 40:47.391
Everybody, all misters...
Russische spies.

40:47.392 --> 40:52.354
Russians? No. They're a different
class of people. That lady's very...

40:52.355 --> 40:55.816
Everybody Russische spies. Fischer...

40:55.817 --> 41:00.821
Fischer is Germanische
spy for Russische. I kill him.

41:00.822 --> 41:05.284
Yes, I kill him. I'll get
a medal, big like this.

41:05.285 --> 41:09.663
Music, boom-broom. General...

41:09.664 --> 41:12.082
I kill him, my friend. Hmm?

41:12.083 --> 41:15.669
- Are you here officially?
- Huh?

41:15.670 --> 41:18.922
Are you here officially?

41:18.923 --> 41:21.884
You mean... Oh, I understood.

41:21.885 --> 41:25.012
Fishely? No. No fishely.

41:25.013 --> 41:29.766
Give you good meat.
I give Russische spies fishely.

41:29.767 --> 41:31.977
Fresh fishely...

41:31.978 --> 41:34.271
English friend, no fishely.

41:34.272 --> 41:37.983
Good meat, shish kebab. Understood?

41:37.984 --> 41:40.861
Good meat, shish kebab. Understood.

41:43.323 --> 41:46.992
Well, I thought I understood.

42:52.559 --> 42:55.018
Stop pacing.

42:55.019 --> 42:58.564
This is not a cage,
and you are not a lion.

42:58.565 --> 43:01.483
OK, I am wrong. You are a lion...

43:01.484 --> 43:05.320
the king of the jungle. My king.

43:05.321 --> 43:09.116
Well, don't just stand there. Roar.

43:09.117 --> 43:12.244
- Or give me a kiss.
- Later.

43:12.245 --> 43:16.707
That's what I like about
you Swiss. You're so sexy.

43:21.254 --> 43:23.630
I don't like Simpson being here.

43:23.631 --> 43:27.259
Arthur Simpson is keeping
you away from my side?

43:27.260 --> 43:30.679
- He's harmless. He's a schmo.
- No, no, no, no.

43:30.680 --> 43:35.100
It's not that. It's a departure
from the plan. This I hate.

43:35.101 --> 43:39.980
Not true. You do
everything with style.

43:39.981 --> 43:44.860
It's a departure from your style,
this you hate. For this I love you.

43:44.861 --> 43:47.362
Mm. Style, my eye.

43:47.363 --> 43:51.367
As long as I get the emerald for you,
you don't care how I get it.

43:53.453 --> 43:57.205
Walter, I don't hide the way
I feel about the emerald.

43:57.206 --> 44:00.208
I don't hide the way
I feel about you.

44:00.209 --> 44:04.630
The emerald excites me
physically, like a man.

44:04.631 --> 44:07.883
Like you. You excite me.

44:07.884 --> 44:11.511
The emerald and you
are fused in my mind.

44:11.512 --> 44:16.225
Each of you excites me
more because of the other.

44:17.727 --> 44:19.937
Mm.

44:19.938 --> 44:23.774
I thought the evening was lost.

44:23.775 --> 44:28.111
I was beginning to wonder
whom I could turn to next.

44:28.112 --> 44:33.033
How about Giulio? Isn't he fused in
your mind with your emerald, too?

44:33.034 --> 44:35.577
Mm.

44:35.578 --> 44:40.499
But there is a dilemma...
so is Hans, so is Cedric Page.

44:40.500 --> 44:42.876
There's a fine figure of a man.

44:42.877 --> 44:46.380
But watch out, the English
are not what they seem.

44:46.381 --> 44:49.466
- Read the papers.
- I know.

44:49.467 --> 44:52.594
There's Arthur Simpson, too.

44:52.595 --> 44:55.138
I feel a strange attraction.

44:55.139 --> 44:58.392
- What's so strange?
- You're so understanding.

44:58.643 --> 45:02.479
He has beautiful eyelashes.
Have you noticed?

45:02.480 --> 45:05.232
First thing I noticed.

45:05.692 --> 45:08.819
Do you mind that I am a nymphomaniac?

45:08.820 --> 45:11.989
No. It's your most endearing quality.

45:11.990 --> 45:15.367
Don't waste it, use it.

45:15.910 --> 45:18.454
The door is open, darling.

45:55.700 --> 45:59.202
Now, Mr Simpson, you can show
us how well you know Istanbul.

45:59.203 --> 46:01.580
We want to see Saint Sophia...

46:01.581 --> 46:04.499
- And the Grand Bazaar.
- Everything.

46:04.500 --> 46:07.628
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Go ahead.

46:07.629 --> 46:10.047
No, no. I prefer my
own brand. I've got a...

46:10.048 --> 46:13.300
Huh? Uh-oh. How stupid of me.

46:41.746 --> 46:44.081
Whoop!

46:44.082 --> 46:48.585
- Papa, there's your pretty searchlight.
- Shut up!

46:48.586 --> 46:51.630
Ooh! Candyfloss!

47:00.640 --> 47:04.643
Couldn't be better. Just a few
hundred yards from the museum.

47:13.653 --> 47:16.280
There's your enemy, the searchlight.

47:16.281 --> 47:18.824
But Walter will take care of it, eh?

47:32.088 --> 47:34.423
Follow me.

48:06.456 --> 48:09.207
- Are the arms in the car?
- They haven't been touched.

48:09.208 --> 48:13.462
I don't think you're an idiot. What made
you suspect they're Russian spies?

48:13.463 --> 48:15.297
- I deduced it.
- From what?

48:15.298 --> 48:17.299
- The cook.
- What did he say?

48:17.300 --> 48:20.052
- They're Russian spies.
- A clever deduction.

48:20.053 --> 48:23.513
- Are they expecting Mr Plimpton?
- I believe they are.

48:23.514 --> 48:26.058
- Is he their leader?
- I think it's Mr Harper.

48:26.059 --> 48:29.770
- And Miss Lipp has her say.
- What has Miss Lipp to say?

48:29.771 --> 48:34.066
- Did you hear her talk to anyone?
- Yes, I heard her speak to Mr Harper.

48:34.067 --> 48:38.070
- What did she say?
- Personal things.

48:38.071 --> 48:42.324
- I don't think they'd be of any interest.
- Everything she says is of interest.

48:42.325 --> 48:46.370
- Well, she said I was attractive.
- Fool! She knew you were listening!

48:46.371 --> 48:49.206
- That's impossible.
- Why'd she say anything so stupid?

48:49.207 --> 48:53.293
Well, she did. She went further.
She said I had beautiful eyelashes.

48:53.294 --> 48:56.838
Did Miss Lipp confide any more
tender secrets to Mr Harper?

48:56.839 --> 48:59.758
Yes, she did. She said
she was a nymphomaniac!

48:59.759 --> 49:02.344
There!

49:02.845 --> 49:05.430
- I just came from the villa.
- What did you find?

49:05.431 --> 49:08.601
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

49:14.816 --> 49:17.067
This is your last chance, Simpson.

49:17.068 --> 49:21.280
Today is Thursday. On Saturday,
three days before the army parade,

49:21.281 --> 49:24.533
your friends will be arrested
and locked safely away.

49:24.534 --> 49:27.327
If, before that, you don't
learn who they work for,

49:27.328 --> 49:33.250
you'll be charged with smuggling arms
into Turkey for terrorist purposes.

49:52.888 --> 49:55.014
That's what I call a handsome man.

49:55.015 --> 49:57.266
Him I would like to take home.

49:57.267 --> 50:00.394
Ah, madam, the sultan
lives here with me.

50:00.395 --> 50:03.147
But please, you come
and visit him again.

50:03.148 --> 50:06.859
We can't. We leave on Monday.

50:07.694 --> 50:10.070
- Monday.
- Monday.

50:10.071 --> 50:17.161
Well, now that the sultan has seen you,
maybe the sultan will leave with you.

50:29.883 --> 50:32.509
Whereas the famous Istanbul dagger

50:32.510 --> 50:35.804
contains the four world's
most priceless emeralds.

50:35.805 --> 50:39.016
The Topkapi treasury
is also famous for...

50:56.826 --> 50:58.953
- Ah!
- Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

50:58.954 --> 51:01.413
Excuse me. Hope I didn't hurt you.

51:01.414 --> 51:04.751
- Any time.
- It's a date.

51:35.365 --> 51:37.783
Did you get the
impression of the key?

51:37.784 --> 51:40.703
- Naturally. Did Cedric get his?
- Yes.

51:40.704 --> 51:44.748
Look behind me. That's the longest
stretch of roof we have to cross.

51:44.749 --> 51:47.293
Look for the places
where we can lie low.

51:47.294 --> 51:50.963
The searchlight sweeps
that roof every 21 seconds.

51:50.964 --> 51:53.591
I can't shoot that light
until we get to this roof.

51:53.592 --> 51:56.844
It's only from there that I
can get a clear shot at it.

51:56.845 --> 52:01.390
Well, we paid our respects to culture.
Tomorrow we'll see the wrestling.

52:01.391 --> 52:04.060
That I like more.

52:30.337 --> 52:32.880
Hey!

53:24.349 --> 53:30.187
While the guards are busy coughing,
this will assure our means of transport.

53:30.188 --> 53:32.231
Pull.

53:34.734 --> 53:37.486
- There is no stronger knot.
- Too strong.

53:37.487 --> 53:39.863
I don't want to leave it up there.

53:39.864 --> 53:43.284
You agreed, "not a trace".

53:43.285 --> 53:46.204
Momento. Giulio...

53:49.874 --> 53:52.418
Pull.

53:55.755 --> 53:59.592
- Genius!
- Boy scout.

54:21.197 --> 54:22.823
- Walter!
- Giulio.

54:22.824 --> 54:26.577
You fool! Sports cars?

54:26.578 --> 54:29.788
Understand this well:
for a year, you'll buy nothing.

54:29.789 --> 54:32.416
For a year, you will
rot in your garret.

54:32.417 --> 54:35.127
There will be an army
organised to find us...

54:35.128 --> 54:39.298
investigators, detectives,
and informers.

54:40.508 --> 54:46.722
The overnight millionaire will be caught
in a spotlight from Istanbul to Peru.

54:46.723 --> 54:50.059
This project's been planned to
the last detail and will work.

54:50.060 --> 54:54.271
If our timing is right, the whole
Turkish Army can't stop us.

54:54.272 --> 54:57.107
We've made contact
with Josef at the fair.

54:57.108 --> 54:59.610
Josef is waiting for
our signal to move.

54:59.611 --> 55:02.196
You were chosen because
you're unknown to the police,

55:02.197 --> 55:04.073
and it'll stay that way.

55:04.074 --> 55:08.744
Everything's ready.
Everything has been timed...

55:08.745 --> 55:14.167
All of the time I knew
that you spy on the spies.

55:16.711 --> 55:19.255
OK, Giulio?

55:30.517 --> 55:33.352
If there's to be a killing,
there can only be one leader.

55:33.353 --> 55:37.023
And that doesn't go for Turkey alone.

55:43.905 --> 55:46.156
Good evening. It's a bit warmer...

55:46.157 --> 55:47.908
- Yeah!
- ...tonight.

55:47.909 --> 55:50.828
- Who's there?
- What are you doing here?

55:50.829 --> 55:53.372
- I'm afraid it's cook, sir.
- Put him to bed.

55:53.373 --> 55:57.418
- Get to bed, you drunken pig!
- Fischer, you Scheisskopf! I kill you!

55:57.419 --> 56:02.048
- Scheisskopf?
- I make you chop-chop!

56:02.757 --> 56:06.802
Big bakaklish.
I make pipilish on you!

56:06.803 --> 56:09.138
Don't be such an idiot!

56:09.139 --> 56:13.059
I give you chotchka!

56:14.060 --> 56:16.270
Hans!

56:24.446 --> 56:26.530
Bakaklish!

56:26.531 --> 56:29.992
My hands!

56:30.327 --> 56:33.663
My hand! My hand!

56:41.379 --> 56:44.757
My hand! He's ruined my hand!

56:45.800 --> 56:47.468
Ah!

57:06.196 --> 57:11.492
So close, so close,
and then this idiot...

57:13.286 --> 57:16.330
I'm sorry, darling.
I know how you feel.

57:24.756 --> 57:28.759
Ah-ah! No good looking at me, dear.
I couldn't possibly hold Giulio.

57:28.760 --> 57:32.597
Why, I used to get blisters
just holding my cricket bat.

57:38.436 --> 57:40.980
Walter.

57:45.902 --> 57:48.654
Cedric, call Simpson.

57:48.655 --> 57:51.199
- Simpson?
- Simpson.

57:53.326 --> 57:54.952
Simpson.

57:54.953 --> 57:59.415
Giulio, bring the nylon cord
from the fishing basket.

58:14.222 --> 58:17.808
- Simpson.
- Yes, yes, sir.

58:17.809 --> 58:20.353
Simpson,

58:20.604 --> 58:23.147
you are wanted.

58:48.048 --> 58:50.591
Give it to him, Giulio.

58:54.638 --> 59:00.226
Simpson, I've just bet $100
you can pull this sofa six feet

59:00.227 --> 59:03.729
with just the strength of your arms.

59:03.730 --> 59:06.023
If you win, you get half.

59:06.024 --> 59:09.026
- I'm not very good at this, sir.
- Try.

59:09.027 --> 59:13.239
As you wish, but you are not asking
me to do this just to settle some bet.

59:13.240 --> 59:15.532
Bravo, Mr Simpson,

59:15.533 --> 59:18.702
but you would still get your $50.

59:18.703 --> 59:21.497
Do it, Mr Simpson.

59:21.498 --> 59:25.126
Do it! Prove that you
are a man, not a jelly.

59:25.669 --> 59:29.464
Feet together. Just the
strength of your arms.

59:41.142 --> 59:43.310
You can do it, Arthur.

59:43.311 --> 59:46.021
I didn't mean to talk
to you like that.

59:46.022 --> 59:49.108
I'm very fond of you.

59:49.109 --> 59:51.986
Try it again, please.

59:55.323 --> 01:00:00.495
Don't yank the cord. Just pull
steadily, hand over hand.

01:00:01.079 --> 01:00:03.247
You can do it.

01:00:03.248 --> 01:00:06.292
Quiet! Feet together.

01:00:16.261 --> 01:00:18.429
Good, Arthur.

01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:21.891
Good.

01:00:25.395 --> 01:00:28.564
Steady, steady!

01:00:29.566 --> 01:00:33.152
Hand over hand.

01:00:54.925 --> 01:00:57.093
Bravo!

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:03.766
Oh! Oh... Oh, well.

01:01:03.767 --> 01:01:06.728
- Dare we?
- Yes.

01:01:07.604 --> 01:01:09.772
We can't postpone.

01:01:09.773 --> 01:01:12.066
- Arthur.
- Yes.

01:01:12.067 --> 01:01:14.610
Come sit down.

01:01:17.906 --> 01:01:20.450
Get it, Giulio.

01:01:21.493 --> 01:01:23.869
Simpson,

01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:26.831
how would you like to make $10,000?

01:01:32.546 --> 01:01:35.214
Ten?

01:01:35.215 --> 01:01:38.092
Hoo! Whoo.

01:01:49.813 --> 01:01:52.356
Paris, Roma, Washington.

01:01:57.362 --> 01:01:59.863
Not a dossier on any
single one of them.

01:01:59.864 --> 01:02:02.199
No dossier, no dossier, no dossier.

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:06.537
But Simpson, "I heard Walter say,

01:02:06.538 --> 01:02:11.584
if we are to make a killing,
there can be only one leader."

01:02:11.585 --> 01:02:19.300
"And if our timing is right,
the whole Turkish Army can't stop us."'

01:02:24.598 --> 01:02:27.141
Do you know what this is?

01:02:27.809 --> 01:02:32.813
It's the... sultan's
dagger from the museum.

01:02:32.814 --> 01:02:37.651
Not yet. We are going
to put it in the museum.

01:02:37.652 --> 01:02:40.362
Close you mouth, my dear fellow.

01:02:40.363 --> 01:02:42.239
Thank you.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.243
Miss Lipp made the copy.
Isn't she clever?

01:02:46.786 --> 01:02:50.414
We are going to exchange
it for the original.

01:02:50.415 --> 01:02:55.294
And we are confident it will be a
long time before anyone is the wiser.

01:02:55.295 --> 01:02:57.630
That's how you will earn $10,000.

01:02:57.631 --> 01:03:03.470
You will be on the museum roof and
lower Giulio over the side by rope.

01:03:04.971 --> 01:03:07.515
Museum roof?

01:03:08.558 --> 01:03:10.809
That's impossible.

01:03:10.810 --> 01:03:13.270
It has to be possible.

01:03:13.271 --> 01:03:15.898
Now that you know about it,
you have no choice.

01:03:15.899 --> 01:03:19.777
You don't understand.
I don't like heights. I get dizzy.

01:03:19.778 --> 01:03:22.447
Give me your hand.

01:03:25.659 --> 01:03:29.411
Arthur, you are a clever man.
You could have gone far.

01:03:29.412 --> 01:03:32.998
But you always played
for small stakes.

01:03:32.999 --> 01:03:35.292
This is your chance.

01:03:35.293 --> 01:03:37.920
You can do it.

01:03:37.921 --> 01:03:41.966
It won't be so difficult.
You won't be on the edge of the roof.

01:03:43.885 --> 01:03:48.347
- Yes, but can I do it?
- You can.

01:03:52.644 --> 01:03:56.606
All right. I'll do it.

01:04:06.658 --> 01:04:11.453
- But what about Turkish Security?
- What about Turkish Security?

01:04:11.454 --> 01:04:15.458
They don't know about the museum.
They think you're terrorists.

01:04:24.551 --> 01:04:27.053
Who thinks so?

01:04:29.472 --> 01:04:32.725
Who? Who?

01:04:32.726 --> 01:04:36.103
It's your own fault. Why'd you
get me to do your dirty work?

01:04:36.104 --> 01:04:39.607
Why'd you get me to bring
the arms into the country?

01:04:45.322 --> 01:04:50.284
They found the arms at the border,
and they let you in the country?

01:04:55.665 --> 01:04:59.043
Then you must be working for them.

01:05:01.755 --> 01:05:05.216
The time has come for us to
leave this beautiful country.

01:05:05.217 --> 01:05:08.719
Cedric, who is going to let you out?

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:11.472
Who, indeed?

01:05:33.787 --> 01:05:37.665
They left the arms in
the car, didn't they?

01:05:37.666 --> 01:05:40.209
Yes.

01:05:41.461 --> 01:05:44.505
And when do they think we'll move?

01:05:45.131 --> 01:05:47.466
Not till Tuesday.

01:05:47.467 --> 01:05:50.428
But they're gonna pick
you up on Saturday.

01:05:50.595 --> 01:05:53.139
Saturday.

01:05:53.807 --> 01:05:56.350
That gives us a
little time, doesn't it?

01:05:56.351 --> 01:06:00.396
Time for what? We can't go forwards,
we can't go back. We're trapped.

01:06:00.397 --> 01:06:03.858
- We're finished.
- Who says we are finished?

01:06:04.359 --> 01:06:07.027
- Just a minute.
- Quiet, Hans.

01:06:07.028 --> 01:06:11.824
When Walter fights in a corner,
that's when he fights at his best.

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:17.830
One thing is sure...

01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:22.626
the gun, the grenades...
they stay in the car.

01:06:22.627 --> 01:06:24.753
We cannot touch them, ever.

01:06:24.754 --> 01:06:27.840
How can you shoot at the
searchlight without a rifle?

01:06:27.841 --> 01:06:31.594
How can you get away from the
guards without the grenades?

01:06:31.595 --> 01:06:36.307
The searchlight and the guards.

01:06:37.684 --> 01:06:40.269
The searchlight and the guards.

01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:43.689
The searchlight and the guards.

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:52.115
There must be a solution.

01:06:59.706 --> 01:07:02.417
Searchlight.

01:07:03.335 --> 01:07:06.003
I wonder.

01:07:06.922 --> 01:07:09.381
Cedric.

01:07:09.382 --> 01:07:11.926
Cedric.

01:07:19.184 --> 01:07:21.728
The guards.

01:07:22.437 --> 01:07:24.981
Elizabeth.

01:07:38.203 --> 01:07:40.663
Elizabeth, laugh.

01:07:40.664 --> 01:07:43.207
- What's so funny?
- Laugh!

01:07:51.341 --> 01:07:53.843
I have news for you.

01:07:55.136 --> 01:07:59.682
Maybe it's even better. God bless
the Turkish Security. Cedric.

01:07:59.683 --> 01:08:03.310
- You want to see me laugh?
- No.

01:08:03.311 --> 01:08:08.316
I want you to take Elizabeth fishing.

01:08:35.926 --> 01:08:40.515
- What are you doing?
- I'm being a lighthouse.

01:08:40.682 --> 01:08:42.683
- Did you get in?
- We did.

01:08:42.684 --> 01:08:45.519
Good. Tell me.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:49.189
It was too easy.
The poor man was so lonely.

01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:52.109
And we did get that invitation
to go back tonight.

01:08:52.109 --> 01:08:56.196
- Good!
- To do what? Hmm? Guess.

01:08:56.197 --> 01:08:59.033
Something no Turk can resist.

01:08:59.033 --> 01:09:03.203
- Must I guess?
- Wrong. Tavli.

01:09:04.788 --> 01:09:08.792
I have been invited to play tavli!

01:09:08.792 --> 01:09:11.379
Giulio, come here.

01:09:11.837 --> 01:09:14.673
Put your hand on the table.

01:09:14.674 --> 01:09:17.301
Now, spread your fingers.

01:09:17.301 --> 01:09:20.511
Turn my hand. This is the
way the beam revolves.

01:09:20.513 --> 01:09:24.265
Two great wheels, their cogs
interlocked, turning each other so.

01:09:24.267 --> 01:09:26.227
Now, try again.

01:09:26.228 --> 01:09:30.231
You see, when I do this, it's slower.

01:09:30.232 --> 01:09:34.277
- How much can you reduce the speed?
- Almost by half.

01:09:34.361 --> 01:09:37.863
The beam comes around every 21
seconds. You can slow it down to 40.

01:09:37.863 --> 01:09:43.118
You gain about 18 or 19 seconds,
Giulio. Is that enough?

01:09:44.912 --> 01:09:47.163
Good work, Cedric.

01:09:47.165 --> 01:09:50.334
I never liked that gun.
It upset the artist in me.

01:09:50.335 --> 01:09:51.835
Picasso!

01:09:51.836 --> 01:09:56.007
- Did you talk to Josef?
- He's ready, willing, and very amused.

01:09:56.466 --> 01:10:00.762
Now, there is just one
more little change.

01:10:04.891 --> 01:10:07.935
We go tonight.

01:10:48.970 --> 01:10:51.806
I'm getting dizzy.

01:11:28.843 --> 01:11:31.512
Now, lift it up.

01:11:37.101 --> 01:11:39.269
- What is it?
- Don't worry.

01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:43.983
Not even Hans could do it. It's like
lifting 200 pounds with one hand.

01:11:56.746 --> 01:11:58.622
Oh.

01:12:28.194 --> 01:12:30.988
Oh!

01:12:36.786 --> 01:12:40.455
That dropped on the museum
floor and we are cooked.

01:12:40.456 --> 01:12:42.207
- Cooked?
- Nothing to worry about.

01:12:42.208 --> 01:12:44.877
You just concentrate on the $10,000.

01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:04.397
- Again?
- I'm nervous.

01:13:07.191 --> 01:13:10.569
To the attention of Major Ali Tufan.

01:13:10.570 --> 01:13:13.780
I, Arthur Simpson,
herewith regretfully resign

01:13:13.781 --> 01:13:17.243
from the Turkish Security services.

01:13:32.926 --> 01:13:35.260
Now, be sure not to lose them.

01:13:35.261 --> 01:13:38.263
Do you want them to
follow us to the museum?

01:13:38.264 --> 01:13:41.683
Are they coming up
on the roof with us?

01:13:41.684 --> 01:13:46.230
We are not going to the museum yet.
First we're going to the wrestling stadium.

01:13:46.231 --> 01:13:49.900
- Wrestling, at this time of day?
- It's a big annual event.

01:13:49.901 --> 01:13:53.445
There's a carnival, too.
It goes on all day until 8.30pm.

01:13:53.446 --> 01:13:57.824
By which time, Arthur,
you'll be tired, happy, and rich!

01:13:57.825 --> 01:14:00.077
Rich!

01:19:47.926 --> 01:19:50.553
Psst!

01:23:16.843 --> 01:23:19.469
It will all be this easy, Arthur.

01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:22.431
Psst.

01:23:46.539 --> 01:23:49.542
Search every corner of the villa.

01:23:49.834 --> 01:23:52.670
Look everywhere for
a cigarette package.

01:23:58.092 --> 01:24:01.679
How much longer are we staying here?

01:24:02.347 --> 01:24:04.890
Until...

01:24:05.642 --> 01:24:08.602
now.

01:25:07.453 --> 01:25:10.247
Ah! Aaah!

01:25:12.083 --> 01:25:15.335
You are all right, Arthur.
You are doing fine.

01:25:15.336 --> 01:25:20.966
57, 58, 59, 60.

01:25:20.967 --> 01:25:23.802
Now the alarm system is set
in every room of the museum.

01:25:23.803 --> 01:25:25.846
There isn't a floor
that can be touched.

01:25:25.847 --> 01:25:28.432
- What do we do next?
- Nothing. Sit.

01:25:28.433 --> 01:25:30.767
- Sit?
- Sit. Until dark.

01:25:30.768 --> 01:25:32.561
Sit. What then?

01:25:32.562 --> 01:25:34.730
Then we'll make our
way to the Treasury.

01:25:34.731 --> 01:25:36.899
- Where's that?
- Over there.

01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:39.026
Huh?

01:25:39.027 --> 01:25:41.612
In... in the dark?

01:25:41.613 --> 01:25:44.323
It's impossible.

01:25:44.324 --> 01:25:47.159
We have to make it in the dark.
There are guards.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:50.162
Not with me. I'll fall, you see.
I get too dizzy.

01:25:50.163 --> 01:25:52.206
Fool, it's easier in the dark.

01:25:52.207 --> 01:25:55.876
I don't think you understand. You won't
get me across there in the dark.

01:25:55.877 --> 01:25:58.378
- You will!
- You can kill me...

01:25:58.379 --> 01:25:59.713
Shh!

01:25:59.714 --> 01:26:03.634
You can kill me, I don't care.
I'm not going across in the dark.

01:26:03.635 --> 01:26:05.428
No!

01:26:07.639 --> 01:26:09.848
All right.

01:26:09.849 --> 01:26:12.560
We'll go now.

01:26:13.519 --> 01:26:16.480
This way. Move!

01:26:31.913 --> 01:26:34.748
Come on!

01:28:13.932 --> 01:28:17.309
Are you all right, Arthur?

01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:19.270
Never... never better.

01:29:05.233 --> 01:29:09.528
All right, Arthur. From now on,
it's all easy. Come!

01:29:52.363 --> 01:29:56.867
There is the Treasury. The roof is not
very strong here, so one at a time.

01:29:56.868 --> 01:30:00.579
First me, then you, then Giulio.

01:30:14.469 --> 01:30:17.888
- It's down here.
- Will you be going through that window?

01:30:17.889 --> 01:30:22.351
No. That would be too easy. We can't
reach the dagger through here.

01:30:22.352 --> 01:30:24.895
Hm?

01:30:33.488 --> 01:30:38.993
- That fair anything to do with us?
- A little bit, Arthur.

01:30:58.638 --> 01:31:00.806
All right?

01:31:00.807 --> 01:31:03.768
They leave in an hour.

01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:17.698
It's going like clockwork.

01:31:17.699 --> 01:31:19.867
That means the fair
is ready to leave,

01:31:19.868 --> 01:31:23.453
and Elizabeth and Cedric are
on their way to the lighthouse.

01:31:23.454 --> 01:31:25.622
It will be dark soon.

01:31:25.623 --> 01:31:29.668
All right, gentlemen,
it's time to undress.

01:31:52.233 --> 01:31:54.735
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:31:54.736 --> 01:31:57.029
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:58.698
Good!

01:32:29.562 --> 01:32:32.648
- What's that?
- The guard house.

01:32:32.649 --> 01:32:36.235
Oh, those smoke grenades...
they were intended to deal with that?

01:32:36.236 --> 01:32:38.153
They were.

01:32:38.154 --> 01:32:40.280
They'll see Giulio going down.

01:32:40.281 --> 01:32:43.617
Elizabeth and Cedric are
taking care that they don't.

01:33:13.231 --> 01:33:16.066
It'll be seconds until
Cedric gets to the light.

01:33:16.067 --> 01:33:18.611
Put your weight against the wall.

01:33:38.339 --> 01:33:41.008
Stop.

01:33:57.942 --> 01:34:01.404
Brace yourself.

01:34:02.488 --> 01:34:04.573
Go!

01:34:10.455 --> 01:34:12.248
Argh!

01:34:19.422 --> 01:34:22.717
Don't let my hand go! Shh, shh, shh.

01:34:38.691 --> 01:34:40.901
Hold it. I've got it.

01:34:40.902 --> 01:34:43.029
Pull!

01:34:47.825 --> 01:34:49.869
Up!

01:35:01.005 --> 01:35:03.257
Hold it!

01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:39.210
- Hey!
- Oh!

01:37:08.883 --> 01:37:12.636
You're not gonna leave me here,
are you? I don't fancy that hole.

01:37:12.637 --> 01:37:16.390
No, Arthur, I wouldn't go
anywhere without you. Come on.

01:37:19.894 --> 01:37:24.148
If I get this out,
it'll give you some support.

01:37:26.651 --> 01:37:29.862
- Can we go soon?
- In about ten minutes.

01:37:29.863 --> 01:37:33.407
But let's take Giulio with us...
and the dagger.

01:37:34.242 --> 01:37:36.618
You are not going to lose your nerve?

01:37:36.619 --> 01:37:40.373
It's not a question of losing
my nerve. I never had none.

01:38:19.287 --> 01:38:21.831
Giulio's on the sill now.

01:38:22.498 --> 01:38:26.127
I'll help you lower him down.

01:38:26.961 --> 01:38:30.089
Can't he do anything by himself?

01:38:38.264 --> 01:38:41.183
Let's go to work.

01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:57.593
Stop!

01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:26.163
Pull up.

01:40:47.101 --> 01:40:50.812
You have to hold it
by yourself now, OK?

01:40:50.813 --> 01:40:53.357
Yes.

01:40:59.489 --> 01:41:02.241
I'm going to let go now,
Arthur. Ready?

01:41:04.619 --> 01:41:06.370
Ready.

01:41:10.333 --> 01:41:12.043
Pull up!

01:45:45.525 --> 01:45:48.569
He's got it, Arthur. He's got it!

01:46:46.377 --> 01:46:50.214
This is the last bit,
Arthur. Lower slowly.

01:46:52.717 --> 01:46:55.177
Slowly!

01:46:56.179 --> 01:46:58.556
I'll tell you when to stop.

01:47:05.855 --> 01:47:07.398
Stop.

01:48:00.285 --> 01:48:02.161
It's done.

01:50:18.172 --> 01:50:21.759
The time has come to ask
you to sit here on the edge.

01:50:22.135 --> 01:50:23.844
Where else?

01:50:25.763 --> 01:50:31.059
Put your hands around this bit of hose,
think of $10,000, and hold on.

01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:34.104
- Then you push me off the edge?
- I wouldn't do that.

01:52:48.031 --> 01:52:49.907
- Major Tufan?
- Yes?

01:52:49.908 --> 01:52:52.576
My name, sir, is Walter Harper.

01:52:52.577 --> 01:52:54.786
This is Miss Lipp, Mr Page,

01:52:54.787 --> 01:52:59.208
Mr Vecchi, Mr Fischer...
and this is Mr Simpson,

01:52:59.209 --> 01:53:02.628
who's been driving us in a car
rented by Mr Plimpton in Greece.

01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:05.380
And borrowed by us
while waiting for him.

01:53:05.381 --> 01:53:06.715
Yes, dear.

01:53:06.716 --> 01:53:09.843
What can I do for you,
gentlemen? Madam?

01:53:09.844 --> 01:53:12.554
Something quite
extraordinary has happened,

01:53:12.555 --> 01:53:14.932
I felt I should report
to someone in authority.

01:53:14.933 --> 01:53:19.520
- What do you wish to report to me?
- I heard a rattle in the car.

01:53:19.521 --> 01:53:23.315
- I heard it first.
- Yes, dear. You heard it first.

01:53:23.316 --> 01:53:26.902
I heard a rattle in the car,
had it investigated,

01:53:26.903 --> 01:53:29.613
and discovered arms hidden in it.

01:53:29.614 --> 01:53:32.241
- Arms?
- Yes.

01:53:32.242 --> 01:53:34.535
A rifle and six grenades.

01:53:42.919 --> 01:53:44.962
Were these arms in the car?

01:53:47.632 --> 01:53:50.176
They certainly look like them.

01:53:52.595 --> 01:53:56.181
How clever of you. Had you lost them?

01:53:56.182 --> 01:53:59.310
No, madam. We had found them.

01:54:00.144 --> 01:54:03.146
May I ask where you have been today?

01:54:03.147 --> 01:54:07.234
At the wrestling, major.
It was quite an experience.

01:54:07.652 --> 01:54:10.445
- Were you there all day, Mr Walter?
- Yes.

01:54:10.446 --> 01:54:13.324
- Madam?
- All day.

01:54:13.491 --> 01:54:17.370
Were you there all day, Mr Simpson?

01:54:24.961 --> 01:54:26.921
No.

01:54:27.422 --> 01:54:30.049
No, sir.

01:54:30.925 --> 01:54:36.138
We didn't get there
until after 3 o'clock.

01:57:21.471 --> 01:57:24.723
Gentlemen, madam...

01:57:24.724 --> 01:57:30.646
sometimes a man's profession
gives him a narrow view of things.

01:57:30.647 --> 01:57:34.441
- I know now why you are here.
- Do you really, sir?

01:57:34.442 --> 01:57:39.321
Yes, Mr Simpson.
A little bird told me.

01:57:43.034 --> 01:57:45.786
Mefkufsunuz.

01:58:30.915 --> 01:58:33.584
Tomorrow we're out.

01:58:33.585 --> 01:58:36.169
- I have an idea.
- Oh, no!

01:58:39.966 --> 01:58:44.804
There is a secret stairway in
the Kremlin. The Romanov jewels...

01:58:45.305 --> 01:58:51.158
