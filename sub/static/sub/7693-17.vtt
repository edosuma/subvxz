WEBVTT

00:11.642 --> 00:14.545
( computer beeps )
 GREAT JOB, GUYS.

00:14.545 --> 00:18.219
YOU JUST TOOK OUT
AN ENTIRE UNIT
OF VIRTUAL CYBORGS.

00:18.219 --> 00:22.693
I THINK IT'S SAD THAT
YOU HAVE TO INVENT PEOPLE
TO PLAY WITH YOU.

00:22.693 --> 00:25.556
ALL RIGHT, LEO,
I'M OFF THE CLOCK.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

00:25.556 --> 00:27.398
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

00:27.398 --> 00:30.331
JUST 'CAUSE
MR. DAVENPORT'S AWAY
DOESN'T MEAN WE STOP TRAINING.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.402
( both groan )

00:31.402 --> 00:33.134
HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL?

00:33.134 --> 00:34.705
I'M MISSING A FOUR-HOUR
DOCUMENTARY

00:34.705 --> 00:36.707
ON THE HISTORY
OF THE PRINTING PRESS.

00:36.707 --> 00:42.443
BUT LEO AND I WERE GONNA PLAY
HUMAN BULL'S-EYE BOUNCE.

00:42.443 --> 00:45.616
DON'T WORRY, IT'S WAY MORE
DANGEROUS THAN IT SOUNDS.

00:45.616 --> 00:48.449
HUMAN BULL'S-EYE BOUNCE.

00:48.449 --> 00:51.552
IS THERE ANY WAY YOU COULD GET
A GOOD ENOUGH BOUNCE
TO LAND IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM?

00:51.552 --> 00:54.685
'CAUSE THAT WOULD
SAVE US A LOT OF TIME.

00:54.685 --> 00:56.287
NOPE, HE'S RIGHT, ADAM.

00:56.287 --> 00:57.788
AS MUCH AS I ENJOY
WATCHING YOU GET HURT--

00:57.788 --> 01:01.732
(laughs) AND I REALLY DO--
WE HAVE TO TRAIN.

01:01.732 --> 01:04.635
OH, COME ON.
 THE ADULTS ARE AWAY!

01:04.635 --> 01:07.638
IF WE DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE
BY DOING SOMETHING DESTRUCTIVE,

01:07.638 --> 01:10.701
WE'RE NO BETTER THAN...
CHASE.

01:10.701 --> 01:14.445
I'M SORRY, BUT UNLESS HE CAN
BE IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE,

01:14.445 --> 01:15.646
HE'S TRAINING.

01:15.646 --> 01:17.748
COME ON,
LET'S GET THE BO STAFFS.

01:17.748 --> 01:20.581
OH, MAN, I NEVER
GET TO DO WHAT I WANT.
IT'S NOT FAIR.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.514
AWW. ARE ALL OF YOUR
COOL BIONIC ABILITIES

01:23.514 --> 01:26.657
AND TOP-SECRET MISSIONS
GETTING YOU DOWN?

01:26.657 --> 01:29.290
AW, THANKS, BREE.
I KNEW YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

01:32.123 --> 01:33.694
(sighs) SORRY, BUDDY.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.297
TOO BAD YOU CAN'T BE
IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE.

01:36.297 --> 01:39.130
Eddie: WELL, NOW HE CAN!

01:39.130 --> 01:41.832
'CAUSE IT'S TIME TO PLAY...

01:41.832 --> 01:46.177
"EDDIE'S WILL IT OR WILL IT NOT
BLOW UP IN YOUR FACE?"

01:46.177 --> 01:48.609
A RIDING MOWER...

01:48.609 --> 01:50.841
A SET OF BARBECUE UTENSILS...

01:50.841 --> 01:54.185
OR A CELLULAR DUPLICATOR!

01:54.185 --> 01:56.817
OOH! I REALLY WANT TO
RIDE SOMETHING ON GRASS!

01:56.817 --> 01:59.850
BUT I DO LOVE THE GRILL.

01:59.850 --> 02:02.853
( game show clock ticking )

02:02.853 --> 02:04.725
( buzzer )

02:04.725 --> 02:08.559
EDDIE, WE'RE GONNA GO WITH
THE CELLULAR DUPLICATOR!

02:08.559 --> 02:10.860
( ding ding ding )
 GOOD CHOICE!

02:10.860 --> 02:12.763
THIS LOVELY
STATE-OF-THE-ART DEVICE

02:12.763 --> 02:15.836
SCANS HUMAN DNA AND CREATES
A LIFE-LIKE DOUBLE

02:15.836 --> 02:18.209
USING SYNTHETIC BIOPLASMA!

02:18.209 --> 02:20.741
TOO COMPLICATED.
GO FOR THE RIDING MOWER.

02:20.741 --> 02:23.844
NO. THIS IS HOW
WE CAN MAKE TWO OF YOU.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.917
IT MAKES A NON-HUMAN TWIN
OUT OF A HUMAN.

02:26.917 --> 02:30.421
THAT'S RIGHT.
BUT BE CAREFUL,
IT'S NOT FULLY TESTED,

02:30.421 --> 02:33.654
SO THERE'S A SMALL CHANCE
IT COULD GO HORRIBLY WRONG.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.187
THEN WHY ARE YOU
TELLING US TO USE IT?

02:36.187 --> 02:39.260
THERE'S A SMALL CHANCE
IT COULD GO HORRIBLY WRONG.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.633
I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT.
WHERE IS IT?

02:42.633 --> 02:44.365
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.537
( ding )

02:48.569 --> 02:50.241
HOW'S IT WORK?

02:50.241 --> 02:53.204
IT JUST NEEDS A SAMPLE
OF YOUR DNA.

02:53.204 --> 02:54.645
OOH! I GOT THIS.

02:54.645 --> 02:55.706
( spits )

02:55.706 --> 02:57.208
( machine whirring )

02:57.208 --> 02:59.680
YA KNOW, YOU COULDA JUST
PUT A HAIR IN THERE, RIGHT?

02:59.680 --> 03:02.213
EWW. THAT'D BE GROSS.

03:02.213 --> 03:03.914
( whirring, crackling )

03:07.688 --> 03:10.461
AW, LOOK! IT HAS MY EYES.

03:14.965 --> 03:17.598
WHOA!
 AWESOME!

03:25.936 --> 03:28.839
THIS MAY HAVE BEEN
A BIG MISTAKE.

03:30.481 --> 03:33.644
THE WORLD'S FIRST
BIONIC SUPERHUMANS--

03:33.644 --> 03:35.386
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,

03:35.386 --> 03:37.648
FASTER, SMARTER.

03:37.648 --> 03:40.291
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

03:40.291 --> 03:42.453
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?!

03:42.453 --> 03:45.456
♪♪

04:20.891 --> 04:23.494
ALL RIGHT, BREAK'S OVER.
FIRE UP THE SIMULATOR.

04:23.494 --> 04:28.268
ADAM, PLEASE REMEMBER:
THE CYBORGS ARE FAKE,
BUT I AM REAL.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.671
JUST ONE QUESTION:
IS THIS REAL?

04:30.671 --> 04:31.672
OW!

04:31.672 --> 04:33.744
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?!

04:33.744 --> 04:36.307
BECAUSE REAL PAIN'S
FUNNIER THAN FAKE PAIN.

04:36.307 --> 04:39.310
UHH! OHH!

04:39.310 --> 04:42.012
YOU'RE A GENIUS? HA!
EVEN I SAW THAT COMING.

04:42.012 --> 04:44.585
OH. AWW!

04:47.558 --> 04:49.960
THIS IS GREAT.
THEY'RE TOTALLY BUYING
DUPLICATE YOU.

04:49.960 --> 04:54.064
I KNOW! THE ONLY THING
MORE FUN THAN HITTING CHASE
IS WATCHING ME HIT CHASE.

04:55.726 --> 04:58.769
LET THE HUMAN BULL'S EYE BOUNCE
BEGIN!

04:58.769 --> 05:00.070
WHOO!

05:00.070 --> 05:02.002
OKAY. IT'S AS EASY AS IT LOOKS.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.905
JUMP AS HIGH AS YOU CAN
AND TRY AND LAND IN ONE OF
THE POINT CIRCLES.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.578
COOL. IT'S JUST LIKE BEING
AT A REAL CARNIVAL.

05:07.578 --> 05:10.981
I KNOW. I EVEN COVERED THE FLOOR
WITH POPCORN AND MYSTERY GOO.

05:13.684 --> 05:15.516
THANKS.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.488
I'LL GO FIRST.

05:17.488 --> 05:18.989
THEY KEY IS TO GET
A LOT OF BOUNCE

05:18.989 --> 05:21.392
AND THEN WORRY ABOUT ACCURACY.

05:22.693 --> 05:25.095
OH, JUST HURRY UP
AND GET HURT!

05:26.797 --> 05:28.399
WHOA!!!!

05:28.399 --> 05:30.060
( crash )

05:32.903 --> 05:35.566
QUICK! GET ME DOWN FROM HERE!

05:36.837 --> 05:38.639
I'VE GOTTA DO THAT AGAIN!

05:43.814 --> 05:45.646
HEY! HANSEL AND GRETEL.

05:45.646 --> 05:48.519
MY NIECE IS VISITING FROM...
UM...

05:48.519 --> 05:50.721
WHEREVER SHE LIVES,

05:50.721 --> 05:53.954
AND I'M GONNA ASSIGN YOU TWO
TO BE CHAPERONES
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.987
OH, UH...
WELL, SEE, I CAN'T,

05:56.987 --> 05:58.429
WE ARE SO SORRY--
 'CAUSE I GOTTA BE--

05:58.429 --> 06:01.862
OH, THAT'S SO CUTE!
YOU THINK YOU HAVE A CHOICE!

06:01.862 --> 06:03.634
HA HA HA HA HA!

06:03.634 --> 06:06.096
BUT WHY WOULD YOU WANT US
TO SHOW HER AROUND?

06:06.096 --> 06:07.868
YOU CAN'T STAND US.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.940
OH. YOU'VE NOTICED.

06:11.041 --> 06:13.043
LOOK, MY NIECE IS
SWEET AND INNOCENT.

06:13.043 --> 06:15.406
IF SHE HANGS AROUND
THE COOL KIDS,
THEY'LL CORRUPT HER.

06:15.406 --> 06:16.977
THAT'S WHY SHE'S
HANGING WITH YOU.

06:18.008 --> 06:19.750
IF IT'S UNCLEAR,
LET ME SPELL IT OUT.

06:19.750 --> 06:21.712
YOU'RE NOT COOL.

06:23.013 --> 06:24.715
HI, AUNT TERRY!

06:24.715 --> 06:26.386
KERRY, DARLING!

06:26.386 --> 06:29.560
THIS IS...THE--
GIMME A SECOND...

06:29.560 --> 06:33.093
KEVVVINNN....

06:33.093 --> 06:35.826
SUZZZZANNNN..

06:35.826 --> 06:37.468
BREE AND CHASE.

06:37.468 --> 06:39.600
(giggling)
NO ONE REALLY CARES.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.903
NICE TO MEET YOU!
I'M KERRY PERRY!

06:42.903 --> 06:44.575
THANKS FOR
SHOWING ME AROUND.

06:44.575 --> 06:46.076
I HOPE IT'S NOT
TOO MUCH OF A BOTHER.

06:46.076 --> 06:49.910
NO, NO. WE ARE HAPPY
TO BE FORCED TO HELP.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.883
GREAT. NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

06:52.883 --> 06:56.186
I'M HEADED TO THE CHEM LAB
TO SEAR OFF A WART.

06:58.088 --> 07:00.821
BYE, AUNT TERRY!
HEE HEE!

07:00.821 --> 07:02.823
HERE'S THE DEAL, LADIES.

07:04.555 --> 07:06.827
I'M SKIPPING SCHOOL
AND HITTING THE MALL.

07:06.827 --> 07:09.730
AND WHEN I GET THERE,
I'M GONNA PLANT A DEAD FLY
IN MY BURRITO

07:09.730 --> 07:11.462
AND EAT FOR FREE.

07:11.462 --> 07:14.064
I'M SORRY,
BUT AS YOUR CHAPERONE--

07:14.064 --> 07:15.536
SHUT IT, SQUAT-MUG!

07:17.107 --> 07:18.969
LITTLE ELVES CALLED--

07:18.969 --> 07:21.812
THEY WANT YOU BACK AT THE TREE
TO MAKE COOKIES.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.946
UM...(laughs)...
YOU CAN'T TALK TO US LIKE THAT.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.878
HA! JUST DID, BOY-HIPS!

07:29.119 --> 07:30.481
I'M OUTTA HERE.

07:30.481 --> 07:31.952
YOU CAN'T JUST GO.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.084
YEAH. WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO TELL YOUR AUNT?

07:34.084 --> 07:36.957
BESIDES THE FACT THAT
SHE SHOULD ROUND UP
SOME BAIL MONEY.

07:39.630 --> 07:42.863
TELL HER I WAS WITH
YOU TWO NIMRODS ALL DAY!

07:42.863 --> 07:44.995
AND YOU BETTER DO MY HOMEWORK.

07:44.995 --> 07:47.467
OR ELSE...
YOU'LL GET THIS--

07:48.468 --> 07:49.970
AUNT TERRY!

07:49.970 --> 07:52.042
THEY WERE SO MEAN TO ME!

07:52.042 --> 07:54.104
(sobbing)
MAKE THEM PAY!

07:54.104 --> 07:56.977
MAKE THEM...PAY.

07:58.709 --> 08:00.981
SO, WE GOOD?

08:00.981 --> 08:02.482
LATER, PEEPS.

08:05.185 --> 08:08.188
OKAY, SHE IS DEFINITELY A PERRY.

08:11.862 --> 08:13.724
( ring tones )

08:15.696 --> 08:16.997
GO FOR DOOLEY.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.969
HEY, HOW'S IT GOIN'?

08:18.969 --> 08:22.072
GREAT. DUPLICATE ADAM
IS ACTING JUST LIKE YOU.

08:26.977 --> 08:29.740
ALTHOUGH HE DID GET A "D" PLUS
ON YOUR GEOGRAPHY TEST.

08:29.740 --> 08:33.212
A "D" PLUS? HE BETTER
DIAL IT BACK OR WE'RE
GONNA GET CAUGHT.

08:33.212 --> 08:36.886
SO HOW'S EVERYTHING
GOING AT HOME?

08:36.886 --> 08:40.220
OH, GREAT. I'M JUST FINISHING UP
THE "NACHO VOLCANO."

08:44.725 --> 08:46.526
(gasps) OH, NO!

08:46.526 --> 08:48.028
THE CHEESE LAVA'S COMING!

08:48.028 --> 08:50.260
RUN FOR YOUR LIVES,
PEOPLE OF JALAPEÑIA!

08:50.260 --> 08:52.703
NO!!! NO!!!

08:52.703 --> 08:55.005
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL SAVE YOU WITH MY MOUTH.

08:55.005 --> 08:56.536
( imitating airplane )

08:58.939 --> 09:00.210
HEY, ADAM.

09:00.210 --> 09:04.014
THAT IS NACHO
 RESPONSIBILITY!

09:04.014 --> 09:05.545
HA HA HA HA!

09:07.147 --> 09:08.248
OKAY, BYE.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.319
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

09:09.319 --> 09:11.081
I WANT TO TALK TO ME.

09:11.081 --> 09:13.253
IT'S FOR YOU.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.185
WHO IS IT?
 YOU.

09:15.185 --> 09:17.157
OH.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.659
HELLO.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.831
HEY, HOW AM I?
 YOU'RE GOOD.
HOW AM I?

09:20.831 --> 09:23.133
YOU'RE GOOD.
 JUST SO YOU KNOW,

09:23.133 --> 09:25.896
I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT
THIS WHOLE SCHOOL THING.

09:25.896 --> 09:28.769
OH, WELL, I'M HAVING A BLAST.
I'M ABOUT TO GO ICE FISHING.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.041
WHAT?!
HOW YOU GONNA DO THAT?

09:31.041 --> 09:33.103
I FROZE LEO'S FISH TANK!

09:33.103 --> 09:35.105
NO WAY!
I GOTTA GO.

09:36.647 --> 09:37.678
( bubbling )

09:44.615 --> 09:46.016
MATH HOMEWORK.

09:46.016 --> 09:48.659
CHEMISTRY HOMEWORK.

09:48.659 --> 09:50.120
HISTORY HOMEWORK.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.663
AND HERE'S YOUR ART PROJECT.

09:52.663 --> 09:54.264
DON'T EXPECT AN "A."

09:55.726 --> 09:57.097
DON'T EXPECT A "THANK YOU."

09:58.999 --> 10:01.101
NOW GIVE ME TWENTY BUCKS.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.973
FOR WHAT?!

10:02.973 --> 10:05.836
MILKSHAKES FOR
ME AND MY GIRLS.

10:05.836 --> 10:07.978
FORK IT OVER, PRINCESS!

10:07.978 --> 10:09.239
WHA--!

10:09.239 --> 10:12.112
YOU JUST GOT A SHAKEDOWN
BY A PRE-TEEN!

10:12.112 --> 10:14.614
I'M THIRTEEN, BUM-SWEAT!

10:15.816 --> 10:18.318
WERE YOU RAISED BY
A GANG OF BIKERS?

10:21.952 --> 10:24.294
THAT'S IT.
WE ARE DONE WITH THIS.

10:24.294 --> 10:26.857
PRINCIPAL PERRY,

10:26.857 --> 10:29.259
WE NEED TO HAVE
A LITTLE DISCUSSION
ABOUT YOUR NIECE.

10:29.259 --> 10:30.961
WE SURE DO.

10:30.961 --> 10:32.963
SHE LOVES YOU TWO!

10:32.963 --> 10:35.635
WHAT?!
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.638
I KNOW. I FIND YOU
 REPULSIVE.

10:39.970 --> 10:41.812
THANKS FOR WATCHING TERRY.

10:41.812 --> 10:44.975
THIS MORNING I GOT TO SPEND
AN EXTRA HOUR AT
THE DOG TRACK!

10:44.975 --> 10:46.877
OKAY, THAT'S GREAT.
BUT WE--

10:46.877 --> 10:49.049
SO NOW I NEED YOU
TO WATCH HER TONIGHT.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.952
I'M PLAYING FLAG FOOTBALL
WITH THE SHERIFFS.

10:51.952 --> 10:54.955
AND HOW DO YOU GET TO PLAY
FLAG FOOTBALL WITH THE SHERIFFS?

10:54.955 --> 10:59.259
GO TO ENOUGH HIGHWAY WRECKS
WITH FREE PIZZA
AND THEY LET YOU IN.

10:59.259 --> 11:03.293
ANYWAY, IF YOU WATCH KERRY,
I MIGHT JUST FORGET ABOUT

11:03.293 --> 11:05.165
THE DETENTION DAYS
YOU'VE ACCRUED.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.336
WHAT DETENTION DAYS?

11:06.336 --> 11:08.699
YOU MOUTHIN' OFF?
YOU JUST GOT DETENTION!

11:08.699 --> 11:11.171
WHAT?! YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

11:11.171 --> 11:12.973
JUST DID,
SALLY SIDEBURNS!

11:14.344 --> 11:17.007
THAT IS IT.
WE ARE DONE WATCH--

11:17.007 --> 11:20.050
UH, CAN YOU JUST
GIVE US ONE SECOND, PLEASE?

11:20.050 --> 11:21.051
HMM.

11:22.052 --> 11:24.114
LOOK, OKAY,
THE GIRL IS A NIGHTMARE,

11:24.114 --> 11:27.187
BUT IF WE DO THIS,
WE MIGHT JUST GET ON
PRINCIPAL PERRY'S GOOD SIDE.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.761
THE WOMAN HAS MANY SIDES--
NONE OF THEM ARE GOOD.

11:33.023 --> 11:34.865
FINE, I'LL DO IT.

11:34.865 --> 11:36.797
( grunting )

11:36.797 --> 11:37.898
OHH.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.431
WE'VE DISCUSSED IT,

11:41.431 --> 11:44.174
AND KERRY IS MORE THAN WELCOME
TO COME OVER TONIGHT.

11:44.174 --> 11:48.739
THERE YOU GO AGAIN--
ACTING LIKE YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

11:48.739 --> 11:49.880
OOOH!

11:51.742 --> 11:53.343
UHHHH!

11:58.749 --> 12:01.191
HEY, WHERE'S DUPLICATE ADAM?
I LOST HIM AT LUNCH!

12:01.191 --> 12:05.125
DON'T WORRY. HE CAME HOME
SO HE COULD GO ICE FISHING
WITH ME.

12:05.125 --> 12:08.028
WHAT?!
 YEAH, IT'S A LONG STORY.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.430
BUT REMEMBER YOUR GOLDFISH
BEYONCE?

12:10.430 --> 12:12.232
YEAH.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.765
SHE'LL BE JOINING US
FOR DINNER.

12:16.867 --> 12:18.969
JUST TELL ME WHERE
YOUR DUPLICATE IS.

12:18.969 --> 12:22.312
HEY, RELAX. I JUST TOLD HIM
EXACTLY WHAT CHASE TOLD ME:

12:22.312 --> 12:25.315
UNLESS YOU CAN BE IN
TWO PLACES AT ONCE,
IT'S BACK TO SCHOOL.

12:25.315 --> 12:27.417
BUT HE DIDN'T GO BACK
 TO SCHOOL.

12:27.417 --> 12:30.150
WELL, THEN WHERE IS HE?

12:41.131 --> 12:42.532
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

12:42.532 --> 12:44.294
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO,

12:44.294 --> 12:47.037
BUT WE'RE GONNA
START A BOY BAND.

13:00.050 --> 13:03.013
OKAY, WHICH ONE OF ME
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS?

13:03.013 --> 13:05.055
HE IS.
 HE IS.
 HE IS.

13:05.055 --> 13:09.119
I ONLY DUPLICATED MYSELF ONCE
BECAUSE YOU SAID I HAD TO
GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

13:09.119 --> 13:10.790
CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.093
THEN THE DUPLICATE I MADE DIDN'T
WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL EITHER.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.095
AGAIN, MAKES SENSE.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.497
ADAM, WE HAVE TO
DO SOMETHING.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.031
I KNOW! LET'S MAKE
ONE MORE DUPLICATE

13:21.031 --> 13:22.272
AND MAKE THAT ONE
GO TO SCHOOL!

13:22.272 --> 13:24.134
NO! NO, NO, NO, NO!

13:24.134 --> 13:25.275
NO. NO. NO!

13:25.275 --> 13:29.139
( crackling )
 YOU BROKE MY ME MAKER!

13:29.139 --> 13:31.111
AND YOU FRIED BEYONCE!
WE'RE EVEN!

13:32.983 --> 13:37.117
OKAY, WE NEED TO FIND A WAY
TO GET RID OF THOSE GUYS.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.249
I'LL GO GET CHASE,
YOU STAY DOWN HERE
AND KEEP AN EYE ON THEM.

13:42.893 --> 13:45.595
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE STUCK HERE
FOR A WHILE,

13:45.595 --> 13:47.998
SO LET'S GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER. I'M ADAM.

13:47.998 --> 13:50.200
All: NO WAY!
THAT'S MY NAME!

13:50.200 --> 13:52.832
NO! WHAT?!

13:52.832 --> 13:55.465
All: NO WAY!
THAT'S MY NAME!

13:57.067 --> 13:58.909
BYE, AUNT TERRY!

13:58.909 --> 14:00.911
LOVE YOU!
(giggles)

14:00.911 --> 14:02.442
OHH.

14:02.442 --> 14:05.045
HER CAR IS DISGUSTING.

14:05.045 --> 14:08.148
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
THE KITTY LITTER ENDS
AND THE COOKIE CRUMBS BEGIN.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.122
ALL RIGHT, KERRY.

14:12.122 --> 14:16.026
YOU'RE ON OUR TURF NOW,
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA PUT UP
WITH YOU BOSSING US AROUND.

14:16.026 --> 14:18.028
I'M NOT STAYING
WITH YOU LOSERS.

14:18.028 --> 14:20.490
I'M GOING TO THE SKATE PARK TO
THROW MARBLES IN THE HALF-PIPE

14:20.490 --> 14:22.862
AND THEN SELL ICE PACKS
IN THE PARKING LOT.

14:22.862 --> 14:26.036
THAT IS PURE EVIL.

14:26.036 --> 14:28.999
YOU CALL IT EVIL,
I CALL IT A LUCRATIVE
SIDE BUSINESS.

14:28.999 --> 14:31.101
( cell phone rings )
 OH,

14:31.101 --> 14:32.872
MY TAXI'S HERE.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.245
DON'T WAIT UP. HA HA HA!

14:37.047 --> 14:39.049
AREN'T YOU GONNA
GO AFTER HER?

14:39.049 --> 14:41.051
AREN'T YOU GONNA
GO AFTER HER?

14:41.051 --> 14:42.983
FINE. WE'LL BOTH GO.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.915
HEY! HEY, GUYS!

14:44.915 --> 14:47.087
UM, WE HAVE A SERIOUS
PROBLEM WITH ADAM.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.289
YOU'LL HAVE TO BE
MORE SPECIFIC.

14:49.289 --> 14:52.062
YES. THERE ARE
FIVE OF HIM.

14:52.062 --> 14:53.623
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

14:53.623 --> 14:55.065
WE MADE DUPLICATES.

14:55.065 --> 14:56.096
WHAT?!

14:56.096 --> 14:57.367
HEY, GUYS.

14:57.367 --> 14:59.930
ADAM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
UP HERE?

14:59.930 --> 15:02.502
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOWNSTAIRS
WATCHING THE OTHER ADAMS.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.174
HELLO? THEY'RE OUR GUESTS.

15:04.174 --> 15:07.077
IT WOULD BE RUDE
NOT TO OFFER THEM DRINKS.

15:07.077 --> 15:09.009
"TWO WATERS, ONE O.J.,

15:09.009 --> 15:12.642
AND ONE BERRY-INFUSED
DECAF GREEN TEA, SOY MILK
ON THE SIDE."

15:14.414 --> 15:17.317
ONE OF ME IS VERY
HIGH-MAINTENANCE.

15:23.453 --> 15:26.026
OHH! THAT'S TWENTY IN A ROW!

15:28.999 --> 15:30.430
MORE ADAMS?

15:30.430 --> 15:33.203
WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE
TO AIR THIS PLACE OUT.

15:33.203 --> 15:36.166
SEE, GUYS? THERE'S NOTHING TO
WORRY ABOUT. THEY'RE ALL HERE.

15:36.166 --> 15:38.368
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THERE WERE FOUR DUPLICATES.

15:38.368 --> 15:40.270
YEAH. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

15:40.270 --> 15:42.072
UH-OH.

15:42.072 --> 15:44.074
JUST GO TRACK DOWN
THE MISSING ADAM.

15:44.074 --> 15:45.945
I'LL KEEP AN EYE ON THEM
AND FIND A WAY

15:45.945 --> 15:48.048
TO REVERSE
THE DUPLICATION PROCESS.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.179
WHERE'S THE DUPLICATOR?

15:49.179 --> 15:52.352
WELL, THERE'S A SHARD OF IT
UNDERNEATH YOUR SHOE.

15:53.583 --> 15:56.126
YOU BROKE THE DUPLICATOR?!

15:56.126 --> 15:59.129
HEY, THAT THING
WAS SQUIRTING OUT AN ADAM
EVERY TEN SECONDS!

15:59.129 --> 16:01.091
WHAT DID YOU WANT ME TO DO?!

16:01.091 --> 16:04.164
JUST...GO FIND
THE MISSING ADAM!

16:08.138 --> 16:09.739
UM...

16:09.739 --> 16:13.043
WE WERE TOLD
THERE WOULD BE BEVERAGES?

16:17.677 --> 16:20.150
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT YOUR DUPLICATE

16:20.150 --> 16:22.012
WOULD BE HIDING
UNDER THE CUSHIONS?

16:22.012 --> 16:24.114
OH, HE'S DEFINITELY BEEN HERE.

16:24.114 --> 16:26.516
MY COUCH COOKIES ARE GONE.

16:26.516 --> 16:29.059
I FIGURED OUT HOW TO
GET RID OF THE DUPLICATES.

16:29.059 --> 16:32.162
WHEN AN ELECTRICAL CURRENT
FLOWS THROUGH THEM,
THEY VAPORIZE.

16:32.162 --> 16:34.694
I ALREADY USED THIS TO ZAP
THREE OF THEM DOWNSTAIRS.

16:34.694 --> 16:37.427
NOW WE JUST HAVE TO FIND
THE ONE LAST ADAM THAT GOT AWAY.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.370
FOUND HIM.

16:40.370 --> 16:41.671
FOUND HIM.

16:44.674 --> 16:47.337
GUYS, WHAT IS GOING ON?

16:47.337 --> 16:50.180
THERE WAS ONLY SUPPOSED
TO BE ONE ADAM LEFT.

16:50.180 --> 16:52.112
( ding, door opens )
 3rd Adam: HI, EVERYONE!

16:52.112 --> 16:53.743
4th Adam: HEY, THOSE GUYS
LOOK JUST LIKE US!

16:53.743 --> 16:55.615
NO, YOU'RE WEARING
WHAT I'M WEARING.

16:55.615 --> 16:58.048
( Adams all talking )

16:58.048 --> 16:59.719
NO WAY!
 NO WAY!

17:01.421 --> 17:03.022
NO. NO.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.755
I CANNOT HANDLE
THIS MANY ADAMS.

17:05.755 --> 17:09.128
THE WORLD CANNOT HANDLE
THIS MANY ADAMS.

17:09.128 --> 17:10.500
THIS IS ARMAGEDDON!

17:12.232 --> 17:14.164
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

17:14.164 --> 17:16.165
IF THERE'S
ONE THING I'M GOOD AT,
IT'S BREAKING THINGS,

17:16.165 --> 17:18.438
AND I DEFINITELY BROKE
THAT DUPLICATOR.

17:19.509 --> 17:21.070
OH, DID I NOT MENTION

17:21.070 --> 17:24.144
THAT THE DUPLICATES
CAN MULTIPLY ON THEIR OWN?

17:24.144 --> 17:25.775
THEY JUST HAD TO LEARN HOW.

17:25.775 --> 17:28.748
AND GUESS WHAT?
I TAUGHT THEM!

17:30.620 --> 17:32.182
( knock on door )

17:32.182 --> 17:35.054
Principal Perry:
 YOO-HOO! ANYBODY HOME?

17:36.126 --> 17:38.188
GUYS! THAT'S PRINCIPAL PERRY!

17:38.188 --> 17:41.261
GREAT. SO NOW THERE ARE
EIGHTEEN ADAMS WALKING AROUND,

17:41.261 --> 17:42.562
AND NO KERRY.
 SHH!

17:42.562 --> 17:44.734
LET'S JUST PRETEND
WE'RE NOT HERE.

17:46.236 --> 17:48.098
Perry: I HEARD THAT.

17:48.098 --> 17:51.341
YOU DON'T THINK
MY PARENTS TRIED THAT
ON ME AT CHRISTMAS?

17:51.341 --> 17:54.104
KERRY?
ARE YOU OKAY?

17:54.104 --> 17:56.075
( banging on door )
 OPEN UP!

17:56.075 --> 17:59.109
EVERYTHING'S FINE!
WE JUST NEED A SECOND.

17:59.109 --> 18:00.680
LISTEN UP, LITTLE PIGS!

18:00.680 --> 18:03.353
I'VE GOT A WELDING TORCH
AND A BATTERING RAM
IN MY TRUNK.

18:03.353 --> 18:06.085
THIS COULD GO EASY,
OR THIS COULD GO HARD.

18:17.527 --> 18:20.330
THAT'S ONLY SEVENTEEN.
THERE'S ONE LEFT.

18:20.330 --> 18:21.501
WHERE IS HE?

18:21.501 --> 18:23.203
I DON'T KNOW.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.335
Perry: LOOK OUT BELOOOOOOW!

18:25.335 --> 18:26.506
( crash )

18:29.879 --> 18:33.213
DID YOU JUST
SHIMMY DOWN THE CHIMNEY?

18:33.213 --> 18:35.485
IT'S OKAY.
I'M A PROFESSIONAL.

18:35.485 --> 18:37.847
USED TO BE A CHIMNEYSWEEP
BACK IN THE NINETIES.

18:37.847 --> 18:40.490
LEARNED THE HARD WAY
NOT TO WEAR A SKIRT.

18:42.652 --> 18:44.154
NOW...

18:44.154 --> 18:45.695
WHERE'S MY NIECE?

18:45.695 --> 18:47.897
UH, SHE'S JUST GETTING
HER THINGS TOGETHER.

18:47.897 --> 18:49.899
SHE'LL BE OUT ANY MINUTE.

18:51.161 --> 18:52.332
HEY, GUYS.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.533
HEY, ADAM.

18:53.533 --> 18:54.834
ADAM?!

18:56.336 --> 18:59.138
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHY ARE THERE TWO OF YOU?

18:59.138 --> 19:01.511
YOU MUST HAVE GOT SOME SOOT
ON YOUR GLASSES!

19:01.511 --> 19:03.173
OH, YEAH! YES, YOU DID!

19:03.173 --> 19:04.874
LET'S GET THOSE CLEANED
RIGHT OFF.

19:04.874 --> 19:08.218
OH.
 HEY! MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A SNACK.

19:08.218 --> 19:09.849
WOULD YOU LIKE
A CELERY STICK?

19:09.849 --> 19:12.882
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
POINT ME TO YOUR PREMIUM MEATS.

19:14.384 --> 19:16.626
HURRY UP AND ZAP THEM.

19:16.626 --> 19:18.928
ALL RIGHT. WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS THE REAL ADAM?

19:18.928 --> 19:20.730
I AM.
 I AM.

19:20.730 --> 19:22.892
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
JUST ZAP 'EM BOTH.

19:22.892 --> 19:25.164
I CAN'T. IF I ZAP THE REAL ADAM,

19:25.164 --> 19:28.398
THE JOLT OF ELECTRICITY WILL
FRY HIS BIONIC INFRASTRUCTURE.

19:28.398 --> 19:30.740
WELL, YOU GOTTA
ZAP ONE OF 'EM.

19:30.740 --> 19:32.572
( zapper powering up )

19:32.572 --> 19:35.475
MAY THE BEST ADAM WIN.
 GOOD LUCK, BRO.

19:35.475 --> 19:36.946
HO...
 HO...

19:38.778 --> 19:40.950
HURRY UP BEFORE
PERRY SEES!

19:40.950 --> 19:44.414
Perry:
YOUR TARTAR SAUCE IS EXPIRED!
CAN I HAVE IT?

19:45.555 --> 19:47.717
I THINK YOU'RE GOOD.

19:47.717 --> 19:50.890
ALL RIGHT. WHICHEVER OF YOU
IS THE REAL ADAM,

19:50.890 --> 19:52.892
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.225
YOU ASKED FOR IT.

19:55.225 --> 19:56.726
WHAT? NO-- NO!

19:56.726 --> 19:58.197
NO! NO! NO!

19:58.197 --> 19:58.898
AAAH!

20:00.830 --> 20:01.871
BYE-BYE.

20:09.879 --> 20:12.282
UH, REMEMBER,
NEXT TIME I COME OVER,

20:12.282 --> 20:14.244
I LIKE MY SALAMI SPICY.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.787
NOW, WHERE IS KERRY?

20:17.787 --> 20:18.918
UH...KE-KERRY--
 SEE, THE THING IS--

20:18.918 --> 20:20.890
KERRY, SHE'S JUST, UH...

20:20.890 --> 20:22.992
WE WERE...
 KERRY!

20:22.992 --> 20:24.994
AUNT TERRY!

20:24.994 --> 20:26.626
YOU'RE HERE!

20:26.626 --> 20:29.829
I WAS JUST TAKING A STROLL
ON THEIR LOVELY GROUNDS, AND...

20:29.829 --> 20:32.402
I MUST HAVE GOTTEN LOST.

20:32.402 --> 20:33.763
SO YOU'RE OKAY?

20:33.763 --> 20:35.234
OKAY?

20:35.234 --> 20:37.567
THESE TWO HAVE BEEN...

20:37.567 --> 20:39.609
WONDERFUL TO ME.

20:39.609 --> 20:42.241
I'M JUST SAD I'M NOT GONNA GET
TO HANG OUT WITH THEM ANYMORE.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.474
WELL, THEN I HAVE
SOME GOOD NEWS.

20:44.474 --> 20:45.945
I'M ENROLLING YOU
AT MISSION CREEK,

20:45.945 --> 20:48.918
SO THEN YOU'LL GET TO
SPEND EVERY DAY WITH...

20:48.918 --> 20:51.921
STEEE...AND DUU....

20:51.921 --> 20:53.883
BREE AND CHASE.

20:53.883 --> 20:55.985
YEAH. I STILL DON'T CARE.

20:55.985 --> 20:57.927

21:04.464 --> 21:06.936

21:06.936 --> 21:07.537

21:07.537 --> 21:10.400
OH. PIZZA'S HERE.
I'LL GET IT.

21:12.542 --> 21:15.044
ONE LARGE PEPPERONI
FOR...ADAM.

21:15.044 --> 21:17.407
THANK YOU VERY MUCH...
ADAM.

21:19.879 --> 21:22.582
THAT'S SO WEIRD.
THAT PIZZA GUY
LOOKED JUST LIKE ME.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.585
UH-OH.

21:25.585 --> 21:28.858
OH, BOY.
 YUP.
 I'LL GRAB THE ZAPPER.

21:31.421 --> 21:34.394
HEY! THERE'S THREE PIECES
MISSING!

21:34.394 --> 21:35.695

21:35.695 --> 21:37.527
