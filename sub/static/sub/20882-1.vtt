03:32.372 --> 03:34.835
I do not even know. "M

She has r hair net to do

03:39.070 --> 03:43.075
I'm glad you all are willing,
tonight we get no jokes, right?

03:43.080 --> 03:45.175
We have much work ahead.

03:45.210 --> 03:47.993
Everyone wanted to come here
and now we go.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.861
Yes.
- Yes, that's right.

03:49.896 --> 03:53.625
Only for one night,
so the cameras must constantly record ...

03:53.660 --> 03:57.068
constantly making sound recordings,
stay focused and alert.

03:57.124 --> 03:58.777
Sure Mr. boss.

03:59.084 --> 04:03.080
I think he was ... But you said pretty,
think he was aware that he was handsome.

04:03.115 --> 04:05.409
Close your eyes and your mouth.

04:06.225 --> 04:08.232
Mouths far.
- That's great though.

04:08.267 --> 04:13.334
Someone I know who called Dave,
has awarded me this great work.

04:13.369 --> 04:17.914
Least I could do. May I
applaud, for your clothing choice?

04:17.949 --> 04:20.035
I did not say it was so,
I said that I liked it.

04:20.070 --> 04:22.123
I'm serious.
I love it, it's beautiful.

04:22.168 --> 04:24.387
What we ...
Glad it behind ...

04:26.616 --> 04:30.053
Perfect, this place is great.

04:30.088 --> 04:31.966
This is really scary.

04:33.544 --> 04:36.408
I can not wait to get here
to spend the night.

04:38.330 --> 04:40.952
Ready to make, dude? Some fun
- Yeah, and you know it.

04:43.328 --> 04:45.340
Dude, I try to look here.

04:49.113 --> 04:51.025
45 years ago ...

04:51.060 --> 04:53.140
I can not see the lens.

04:53.175 --> 04:56.293
Present at all like I told you, right?

04:56.328 --> 04:58.075
Backwards?

04:58.110 --> 05:00.173
Or so far?
- Just turn on the camera.

05:00.208 --> 05:03.039
We are ready.
- Action.

05:03.479 --> 05:06.990
Tonight, we are here
a neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois.

05:06.991 --> 05:12.810
The address is 100 East ... 2390 ...

05:12.811 --> 05:15.296
You say the real address,
Then you give them ...

05:15.297 --> 05:17.781
the false address devised
was after the crimes.

05:17.782 --> 05:20.765
For those who believe in the paranormal ...

05:20.766 --> 05:22.711
the Ghost Street, No. 100.

05:22.712 --> 05:25.091
It is here in this deserted
medical dormitory ...

05:25.126 --> 05:28.331
where one of the most terrible
massacres took place.

05:28.366 --> 05:32.055
45 years ago,
seven murders in one night.

05:32.090 --> 05:35.719
By a man.
Richard Franklin Speck.

05:35.754 --> 05:38.401
Also known as the Birdman.

05:38.436 --> 05:40.403
Why are you looking at me?

05:40.448 --> 05:42.127
Finish it by looking at ...
- Okay.

05:45.554 --> 05:48.933
No ... It's a little, not too scary.

05:48.934 --> 05:52.049
Do not worry,
I'll be there tomorrow night.

05:52.485 --> 05:56.139
Yes, I'll be there.
Yeah, me too.

05:59.003 --> 06:00.789
Who was that?

06:01.905 --> 06:03.511
My mother.

06:03.715 --> 06:07.687
Your mother?
- We are committed, right?

06:08.948 --> 06:13.299
I do not want you there frightened,
anyone can foist any ideas ...

06:13.334 --> 06:14.629
about that.

06:15.056 --> 06:17.514
Okay, I understand that.
- I'm serious.

06:17.549 --> 06:21.216
I'm serious too.
- If you need anything, you come to me.

06:21.251 --> 06:23.298
Well, thank you.

06:27.070 --> 06:30.248
All cameras are pointing.
Some still on the roof.

06:30.308 --> 06:34.328
Earl's here somewhere, do not know where.
I'm looking for him for a while. He'll go away.

06:34.363 --> 06:36.655
Here are the keys.

06:36.690 --> 06:38.894
The phones work in all.
Absolutely nothing.

06:38.929 --> 06:42.112
In the whole building?
- No SMS, no calls ...

06:42.113 --> 06:44.558
what you may have in mind ...

06:44.593 --> 06:48.862
This key and I can not get enough
emphasize close the door from the inside.

06:48.897 --> 06:52.540
Even if you're five minutes out,
here there are wanderers. This is the key ..

06:52.575 --> 06:54.470
close.
- Roger that.

07:14.330 --> 07:16.256
That bag looks heavy.

07:19.166 --> 07:21.292
Nice.

07:27.033 --> 07:30.198
I have to assume something?
- Yes, thank you.

07:42.954 --> 07:45.394
Do you need help with something
- Yes.

07:45.860 --> 07:48.647
Thanks for all your help.
- Absolutely.

07:49.730 --> 07:51.722
Well, everything is ready.

07:51.723 --> 07:55.065
We have about twelve detached
cameras turned on. All are on.

07:55.100 --> 07:59.153
And everything is stored
on the hard drives there.

07:59.154 --> 08:03.551
I'm another one reinforce the roof.
I'll get Earl and we are away.

08:03.581 --> 08:06.328
And everything is automatically saved?
We should do nothing?

08:06.363 --> 08:09.413
Everything is wireless and is
on the hard drive, so ...

08:09.824 --> 08:14.077
As always, all right, so ...
Join Casper greetings.

08:17.285 --> 08:22.519
You use this, you just need to press here
and keep it in the direction of the sound.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.388
Well, gonna be okay.
- Thank you.

08:30.052 --> 08:34.061
Five hours or so?
- Langer, I hope more than that.

08:34.106 --> 08:35.972
I do not know.
- Yes, you will.

08:37.315 --> 08:39.886
Jim, stop that.
- I'm sorry.

08:42.643 --> 08:46.125
You are the next star. You can better
get used to stand in the spotlight.

08:46.160 --> 08:48.621
Yes, I see now than good?
- You look fantastic.

08:48.656 --> 08:50.628
Give me the camera.
- Stop it.

08:50.858 --> 08:56.033
Come on, you're next.
I want to hear about Kim today.

08:56.058 --> 08:57.729
About me?
- Yes.

08:57.779 --> 09:00.831
I was born in 1963.

09:00.866 --> 09:03.289
Wait, you're not ...

09:03.324 --> 09:05.979
What?
- Come here.

09:07.233 --> 09:09.245
There you are.

09:09.793 --> 09:16.141
So Jim, tell us a story ...
You have a spider in your hair.

09:17.005 --> 09:20.323
I'm sorry, now is your hair upside down.
- Oh, right.

09:20.358 --> 09:23.437
It takes hours to get my hair
get. so disastrous

09:50.313 --> 09:52.049
What the ...?

10:26.740 --> 10:29.639
Jim, let me know when you're done?
- Yes.

10:29.674 --> 10:31.053
Action.

10:31.088 --> 10:34.575
Many people believe that Richard Speck's
mind here is returned.

10:34.625 --> 10:38.632
The house of his infamy.
And he still haunts here.

10:38.682 --> 10:41.710
Searching, longing,
to kill again.

10:41.760 --> 10:44.999
Again, something fierce.
Understood?

10:45.572 --> 10:47.365
We do the same record again.

10:47.774 --> 10:54.273
On July 13, 1966, Richard Speck walked this
dormitory in hostage and eight nurses.

10:54.346 --> 10:57.880
He them hostage in a bedroom.
Room 220.

10:58.946 --> 11:02.263
Methodically, he dragged one woman
after another out here ...

11:02.377 --> 11:04.736
to various places in this huge building.

11:04.737 --> 11:09.018
Where he would rape them, strangle,
hang or his prey would cut.

11:09.019 --> 11:14.096
While the girls wait their turn,
she cried and begged for mercy.

11:21.636 --> 11:23.120
Was that all right?

11:23.165 --> 11:25.484
I'm not as mad as ...

11:25.820 --> 11:28.199
Rosa Martinez hid under the bed.

11:28.234 --> 11:32.013
Richard Speck and heard a woman
drag this mattress.

11:32.014 --> 11:34.664
That he raped and strangled.
The moment he came ...

11:34.699 --> 11:38.534
He stabbed her in the heart.
While living Annie left ...

11:38.535 --> 11:41.411
Rosa fled along this window.

11:41.446 --> 11:45.990
But the fear never ended for Rosa,
because her whole life ...

11:45.991 --> 11:49.596
she always return
Richard feared.

11:49.631 --> 11:52.634
While we are in this room,
I want you to try ...

11:53.051 --> 11:57.065
to communicate with that guy right?
He had difficulty with women.

11:57.066 --> 11:58.714
Yes.
- We need you here now.

11:58.764 --> 12:01.813
His energy is strong in this room,
I want you to call him.

12:01.863 --> 12:04.008
Good.
- Threaten him if necessary.

12:04.094 --> 12:09.317
Tell him that this is his chance, do something,
knock on a wall, move an object.

12:09.318 --> 12:10.844
Something.
- Good.

12:10.894 --> 12:13.688
He announces his presence.

12:14.266 --> 12:18.530
We try to communicate
with the spirit of Richard Speck.

12:19.013 --> 12:22.478
If you're here, give us a sign.

12:22.648 --> 12:25.022
Show your presence.

12:31.239 --> 12:34.526
Richard, if you're here,
Please give us a sign.

12:34.527 --> 12:37.076
We try to communicate with you.

12:37.583 --> 12:40.014
Take all try to miss anything.
- Yes.

12:40.064 --> 12:43.922
Make your presence known,
if you are here, give us a sign.

12:46.996 --> 12:50.622
Richard if you are here,
Make your presence known.

13:08.737 --> 13:13.330
Tell me you recorded that.
- I think I just have it be the end.

13:27.525 --> 13:29.316
Tell me what you see.

13:30.048 --> 13:33.150
I see many pipes. And ...

13:33.708 --> 13:35.528
bird feathers.

13:38.010 --> 13:43.576
Why are there feathers?
- I do not know, they've been around here.

13:43.768 --> 13:46.486
Well, just check to sounds.

13:47.506 --> 13:52.440
I saw holes in the walls,
there they entered through.

14:04.137 --> 14:07.990
Did you hear that?
- Yes, I heard.

14:10.706 --> 14:14.238
What is it? Knocking, jogging, scratches, what?
-. I do not know

14:14.288 --> 14:16.579
Seemed like a sound of a pipe.

14:16.599 --> 14:19.744
It was like a voice.
There was heard a voice.

14:19.876 --> 14:21.842
Could it be a voice?
- Could be.

14:21.882 --> 14:25.096
I'm not as good as heard her.

14:25.097 --> 14:27.114
Yes, I have it recorded.

14:27.115 --> 14:30.008
What kind of voice?
- Yes, it was great.

14:30.196 --> 14:32.804
That's good, fantastic.
- Yeah, that was great.

14:47.490 --> 14:48.862
Hello?

14:54.079 --> 14:56.988
<i> Help. </i>

15:10.336 --> 15:13.416
Was that you, Sarah?

15:18.672 --> 15:20.950
Is there anybody in there?

15:22.030 --> 15:24.811
<i> Please help me.
Someone help. </i>

15:24.851 --> 15:27.266
What is that?

15:30.741 --> 15:32.612
<i> Help. </i>

16:21.226 --> 16:25.224
First job, first job for the job.
- Your first day, are you serious?

16:25.259 --> 16:31.008
Unbelievable.
- Paranormal investigation seriously.

16:31.272 --> 16:35.741
You're gonna have to learn quickly that Adam
wants too much visual recordings.

16:35.742 --> 16:39.290
It's really dark in here.
- Yes, really dark.

16:39.380 --> 16:43.384
Continue to go straight ahead.
- All the way up it end?

16:45.354 --> 16:48.658
Wait a minute.
Hold on.

16:50.206 --> 16:52.378
That's scary in itself.

16:52.604 --> 16:54.988
Yes, all or nothing.

16:55.033 --> 16:56.758
It?
- This?

16:58.346 --> 17:03.678
Where it smells bad.
- It really stinks here.

17:09.810 --> 17:12.616
That reminded me of the university.

17:13.414 --> 17:17.984
Good times.
- It's very scary here.

17:20.020 --> 17:22.614
Yes?
- Can you shine with light here?

17:22.648 --> 17:24.181
Do you have what?

17:24.226 --> 17:25.585
Yes, I think ...

17:29.276 --> 17:32.654
No, look down.

17:35.500 --> 17:38.896
Is there blood?
That is so dirty.

17:39.263 --> 17:41.630
No idea what that is.

17:41.704 --> 17:43.894
I'm going to do the EVP session.

17:43.929 --> 17:46.212
Yes, fire away.
'm Ready.

17:47.884 --> 17:53.237
You can 't should first turn.
That one button, yes.

17:53.567 --> 17:55.296
I've been through, I learn quickly.

17:55.341 --> 17:58.306
I've quickly.
- I'm so proud.

18:04.475 --> 18:09.966
If there are spirits
who want to communicate with us ...

18:09.999 --> 18:13.841
Make your presence known.

18:14.158 --> 18:16.264
If ...
- Please?

18:18.590 --> 18:23.030
If Richard Speck, or one of its
victims here ...

18:23.080 --> 18:26.576
Please give us a sign.

18:37.931 --> 18:41.721
Is that normal?
- Try it again.

18:41.771 --> 18:45.493
If Richard Speck or one of his victims
here give us a sign ...

18:45.528 --> 18:47.742
of your presence.

18:48.151 --> 18:51.573
Please give us a sign.

18:56.762 --> 19:00.183
Richard Speck, if you're here ...

19:00.228 --> 19:03.768
Give us a sign of your presence.

19:21.215 --> 19:25.004
That's the other team, right?
Those things just move?

19:25.404 --> 19:27.949
That's impossible.

19:29.054 --> 19:32.477
We are on the top floor.

19:32.676 --> 19:34.186
Come on.

19:35.277 --> 19:37.737
What are you doing?

19:42.696 --> 19:47.579
I think we should take this to Adam
and show what we have him.

19:49.638 --> 19:51.852
Yes.
- I need the light.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.416
Did you hear that?
- Yes.

20:00.607 --> 20:04.460
I'm going to climb it.
- I do not think you should.

20:04.495 --> 20:08.627
Really, that's really not safe.

20:14.216 --> 20:16.819
Give the camera here.

20:16.909 --> 20:19.534
I want to look up.

20:21.698 --> 20:24.752
Just a second.

20:29.786 --> 20:31.974
What's up there?

20:33.352 --> 20:35.259
Nothing.

20:35.719 --> 20:41.674
Oh, I swear ...
- Wait ... I'm sorry.

20:41.709 --> 20:43.841
Come back.
- I should leave alone.

20:43.891 --> 20:46.420
Can you take the camera?
I want to come down.

20:46.421 --> 20:50.180
That was funny, come on.
- You scared me.

20:53.711 --> 20:55.578
I'm sorry.

20:59.192 --> 21:01.326
Okay, Jackie ... Action.

21:01.376 --> 21:04.489
Richard Speck was a long
and unattractive man.

21:04.524 --> 21:07.075
He had scars from acne and oily hair.

21:07.110 --> 21:11.775
When he was imprisoned
was nicknamed "Birdman" assigned to him ...

21:11.810 --> 21:14.703
because he kept some birds ...

21:20.927 --> 21:24.912
Jackie, that's just old tiles
who were released, right? Just do.

21:24.956 --> 21:28.980
Jackie, your heart beats like crazy into the microphone.
-. You just freaked out

21:32.848 --> 21:35.489
That's really handsome, dude.
- I know.

21:35.625 --> 21:40.248
You're too good for us.
- I have not prepared yourself, though.

21:42.795 --> 21:46.418
You wanted the healthy food?

21:47.857 --> 21:51.468
I'm sorry, there's no coffee.
- I want a banana.

21:51.506 --> 21:54.380
Yes, I'm sorry, I'll get them.

21:56.970 --> 22:00.143
Why do you eat?
- Dave, tell me what you have?

22:00.178 --> 22:03.086
We have heard some voices above.

22:03.087 --> 22:06.125
The nice thing was that it was above us
and we were on the top floor.

22:06.126 --> 22:09.560
You should take a look for themselves,
I have a crawl space found.

22:11.548 --> 22:15.056
But I heard something.
So there is definitely something up there.

22:15.057 --> 22:18.218
And as I said, we were on the
top floor and you were down here.

22:18.219 --> 22:22.172
So you have nothing.
- Well ...

22:22.207 --> 22:26.897
You know, the real problem,
is Richard Speck.

22:26.898 --> 22:28.987
How can you tell?

22:28.988 --> 22:33.078
A feast murder of an amateur,
he killed eight people.

22:33.079 --> 22:35.881
Actually seven.
- Worse, even less so.

22:35.916 --> 22:38.944
The numbers are irrelevant.
- Oh yes, to talk about real numbers.

22:39.119 --> 22:43.443
Dummer, 17. Double number, decent.
And when talking about the big ones have ...

22:43.478 --> 22:46.307
Let it then about Gacy, 33.
Let's go to his house.

22:46.342 --> 22:50.934
Gacy have already done so much.
- Richard Speck's a joke.

22:54.789 --> 22:57.780
That's why I wanted one of you
recording at all times.

22:57.781 --> 23:03.157
Guys, that was just a coincidence.
- You made him angry, you called him an amateur.

23:03.192 --> 23:06.477
The same was us another time
had happened.

23:45.997 --> 23:49.483
This large bookcase has fallen.

23:49.484 --> 23:53.444
There really is no explanation why this ...
- Wait, did you hear that?

23:53.445 --> 23:54.683
What?

23:54.684 --> 23:57.354
Seemed like a scream.
- What?

23:57.355 --> 23:58.708
Silence.

23:58.743 --> 24:01.360
As if someone called, or so ..

24:11.236 --> 24:14.030
Go with Jackie upwards,
we will do this floor.

24:14.031 --> 24:16.856
Dave keep recording.

24:16.857 --> 24:18.846
Jim, come on.

24:28.882 --> 24:30.670
Where is she?

24:31.768 --> 24:36.676
I do not know, there's so much echo,
have no idea where it came from.

24:36.878 --> 24:39.139
Apparent here once light, Jim?
- Yes.

24:40.826 --> 24:43.147
Look in all rooms, Jim.
Do your best.

24:45.239 --> 24:48.495
I do not understand why they do not answer.

24:49.459 --> 24:51.450
Hello?

25:05.066 --> 25:07.410
Where did she go?
- Maybe she's okay?

25:07.445 --> 25:10.876
She'll be okay.
She is afraid of her own shadow.

25:11.100 --> 25:13.297
Jim?
- Yes.

25:19.886 --> 25:22.170
Wait ...
Silent.

25:23.523 --> 25:25.754
You might say something mechanical, yes.
- Just what stumbling.

25:25.799 --> 25:27.426
Have you heard it?

25:29.672 --> 25:33.919
I heard it too.
- Wait, it comes from here.

25:37.570 --> 25:40.058
I can not enter.
- Let me try.

25:43.564 --> 25:45.092
Sorry.

25:45.510 --> 25:47.482
Look, it moves.

25:48.442 --> 25:52.966
How can that move now?
- There is absolutely no electricity.

25:52.967 --> 25:57.012
This is wrong.
- Maybe it's because of its own weight ...

25:57.057 --> 26:00.512
if not on his brake state, I think.
- It is beyond the 1.

26:00.678 --> 26:03.619
It goes to the basement.
- Come on.

26:08.436 --> 26:10.082
Be careful.

26:13.345 --> 26:15.584
Come on, Jim.

26:17.996 --> 26:20.076
What was that?

26:21.037 --> 26:23.018
Come on now.

26:29.227 --> 26:30.923
Do you have it?
- Yes.

26:31.338 --> 26:33.155
Careful.
- Good.

26:43.657 --> 26:46.328
Look at this.

26:47.728 --> 26:49.969
She is nowhere to be found.

26:52.298 --> 26:55.477
Apparent here something light.
- What you got?

26:55.512 --> 26:58.503
Jim, come here.

26:59.110 --> 27:02.661
That is the elevator shaft, yes.
- I can not look inside.

27:02.696 --> 27:04.993
See if you get it open.

27:12.799 --> 27:17.946
There she certainly not resident.
- This has not been eventful years, look.

27:18.350 --> 27:21.708
Look how dirty.

27:21.709 --> 27:24.261
It's just water but.

27:25.671 --> 27:28.770
How could that thing then move?
- Maybe it was just the needle ...

27:28.805 --> 27:33.645
this has not changed obviously.
- That's weird.

27:41.621 --> 27:44.364
There has been someone herein.

27:46.431 --> 27:48.619
What was that?

27:51.621 --> 27:53.273
A fish?

28:22.021 --> 28:24.441
What is it?

28:35.296 --> 28:37.231
Sarah, stop it.

28:37.266 --> 28:39.550
Was she?
- That was a cry, definitely.

28:39.595 --> 28:41.269
She's upstairs.

28:45.503 --> 28:47.594
It's only me.
- I found ... in here.

28:50.037 --> 28:52.417
Please, stop.

28:52.452 --> 28:55.457
No.
- Honey, calm down.

29:00.217 --> 29:02.872
What happened?
- Shut up.

29:05.919 --> 29:08.478
It's all good.
- There's no one out there.

29:09.490 --> 29:12.268
Tell us what happened.

29:19.924 --> 29:25.179
She needs a doctor.
- What happened to her?

29:26.647 --> 29:30.668
We gotta go, we gotta go now.
We gotta get outta here.

29:30.703 --> 29:35.187
Sarah, what happened to you?
- He's here. He was here.

29:35.222 --> 29:37.323
Who?
- Who is he?

29:38.327 --> 29:41.154
Who did that to your arm?

29:44.221 --> 29:48.386
We're going to look after.
Calm down.

29:49.600 --> 29:53.972
Get her out of here.
- Let me go, please.

29:54.007 --> 29:57.292
I have to leave.
Please.

30:02.778 --> 30:05.287
Come on.
- I'll take her.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.937
Sarah, I'm sorry.

30:13.453 --> 30:16.192
Let me take care of you.

30:17.161 --> 30:20.387
Sarah, can you tell us
what happened to you in that room?

30:20.422 --> 30:22.760
We can first take care of her.

30:25.330 --> 30:27.777
Do you see this?
- Yes.

30:27.822 --> 30:30.970
It is not too deep.
Take care of it and attach it.

30:31.015 --> 30:34.288
Keep your arm up as well.
Jim, really a oorstaafje?

30:34.333 --> 30:35.850
Cameras keep it going.

30:36.965 --> 30:40.329
Since we have nothing.
- Want a gauze bandage?

30:40.364 --> 30:42.442
Yes, gauze is good.

30:42.487 --> 30:44.472
Guys, hurry up.

30:44.507 --> 30:47.210
Want to go home?
I gotta get her here, guys ...

30:47.245 --> 30:50.952
they should go home and rest.
She's terrified.

30:50.987 --> 30:54.450
Go to bed and sleep it.
- I'll take you home, okay?

30:54.485 --> 30:57.493
They're not going home, Dave.
- Are you serious?

30:57.528 --> 31:00.362
Yes, I mean it.
- Her first day and she is attacked.

31:00.397 --> 31:05.098
It's my show and I decide what we do.
- Who's the big guy here now, huh?

31:05.133 --> 31:07.352
Give her one of these.

31:11.024 --> 31:14.735
Just put it under your tongue.
- What effect does this have?

31:14.785 --> 31:19.245
Help her sleep.
I take them myself, they are harmless.

31:19.797 --> 31:24.361
Here.
- I know you're upset.

31:24.396 --> 31:27.664
So alone in the corner of a room.

31:27.665 --> 31:31.608
And you're hurt.
Can you tell us something?

31:31.643 --> 31:35.602
Well, Dave, if you do not bring her,
I'll do it. Decide what.

31:36.127 --> 31:37.403
Do you ...

31:37.711 --> 31:41.647
Come here.
We stand upright.

31:41.682 --> 31:43.929
Come on, is okay.

31:44.530 --> 31:48.221
Certainly, Jim
- Thank you, Sarah.

31:49.381 --> 31:51.890
That's really not much sleep.

31:51.891 --> 31:56.582
She's okay, just a little shocked.
It's her first day and so.

31:56.622 --> 31:59.802
Why is it so hard to take
that happened to her? something paranormal

31:59.837 --> 32:05.580
Firstly, I have not seen Mike or Earl ...
- It's not Mike or Earl.

32:05.615 --> 32:10.531
They work all the time, good. We would know
whether they have in their past women attacked.

32:10.566 --> 32:13.105
Not required or Mike Earl,
but I really think ...

32:13.140 --> 32:16.643
I do not think it's something ...
- Whatever, does not matter.

32:16.678 --> 32:22.384
I want you to go to the basement.
He responds to people who make a start.

32:22.419 --> 32:25.396
Yes.
- Start there, see what you will get. Good?

32:25.431 --> 32:28.950
You have some blood on your shirt Sarah.
Are you going to go change.

32:28.985 --> 32:31.916
I'm going to get my camera,
I want some pictures of you ...

32:31.951 --> 32:35.395
that explains what we found in the room.

32:35.440 --> 32:39.391
Thank you, keep some distance, right?
- Good.

33:01.256 --> 33:04.324
Sarah, I'm going to explain it.

33:07.157 --> 33:09.188
Is it?

33:09.776 --> 33:12.274
Give me your shoes.

33:15.544 --> 33:17.343
I know it.

33:30.914 --> 33:35.357
Jim, I can not see anything.
- Come after me, I'll follow you.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.362
There you go.

33:41.458 --> 33:43.642
Great.

33:46.389 --> 33:49.980
What is that?
- I'm going back to the door.

33:50.436 --> 33:52.116
What is there?

33:54.568 --> 33:56.037
I'm sorry.

33:56.072 --> 33:58.531
I scared me.

34:01.841 --> 34:05.499
An electricity thing.

34:06.486 --> 34:08.465
What is that?

34:11.193 --> 34:13.370
Look, you see that?
- Yes.

34:13.371 --> 34:16.518
The pipes in the walls.

34:16.563 --> 34:21.025
Is that right below where we just now
were when we heard that sound.

34:21.393 --> 34:25.896
Can best.
- No, I'm sure.

34:26.431 --> 34:28.667
It is two floors below.

34:30.252 --> 34:33.301
It's something like ...

34:33.335 --> 34:37.484
sound that could best come here.

35:03.339 --> 35:07.131
What is the dirt we walk?

35:17.137 --> 35:21.721
We will try if we can register something?
- Yes.

35:45.300 --> 35:48.975
What is that?
That's gross.

35:52.939 --> 35:54.951
Did you hear that?

35:56.385 --> 35:58.825
I do not know,
I have heard nothing here.

35:58.860 --> 36:01.653
No, it did not sound like it was here.

36:01.688 --> 36:06.429
Which is it?
- From somewhere out there, let's go.

36:11.451 --> 36:13.421
You know what I read?
- What?

36:13.471 --> 36:18.124
I have read that Speck
was molested as a child.

36:18.159 --> 36:20.033
I think even by his father.

36:20.068 --> 36:23.531
What is all this explained,
because you know, those poor children ...

36:23.566 --> 36:26.881
who were abused as children ...
That's interesting.

36:26.916 --> 36:32.275
Which always end up being confused adults.
- That's exactly what he did to those women.

36:32.310 --> 36:34.899
That's what he did to them.
It's just a cycle.

36:37.723 --> 36:41.199
What is that? There in the corner.

36:47.413 --> 36:51.329
Do you think we should go in there?
- Yes.

36:52.201 --> 36:54.785
I will put the camera in there.

36:54.820 --> 36:59.505
These hinges,
an incinerator or so.

37:00.547 --> 37:03.545
I do not climb into.
I'm claustrophobic.

37:03.580 --> 37:06.713
That's crazy.
- No, that's not it.

37:06.714 --> 37:09.871
When I was little, my mom
locked me in a closet.

37:09.906 --> 37:16.161
I was totally scared, my heart
knocked so hard that I cried hours.

37:16.196 --> 37:21.189
And since I can no longer lifts
or dense traffic ...

37:21.224 --> 37:26.671
or MRI, I'm just crazy.
So is not gonna happen.

37:27.086 --> 37:28.849
I'm telling you but just.
- Is good.

37:28.884 --> 37:33.703
But you can go in there.
- If I could, I did so, though I do.

37:34.869 --> 37:37.710
What cold.

37:37.745 --> 37:43.460
Where do you think the leads go?
- No idea, it's a trip out, I think.

37:46.199 --> 37:47.443
What?

37:47.478 --> 37:52.560
- I saw something. I saw something there.
- What ... good.

37:54.138 --> 37:57.597
You know what?
I put it to infrared.

37:57.642 --> 38:00.180
I do not know.
I saw it.

38:04.072 --> 38:08.274
I thought I saw something.
Let's see if I can dim him and see something.

38:08.319 --> 38:10.870
No, do not.

38:11.576 --> 38:14.242
It's good.
Just stay behind me.

38:14.277 --> 38:16.832
Now you see nothing, right?
- No?

38:16.867 --> 38:19.412
Good.
Let's see if we can find something.

38:22.510 --> 38:26.508
I think we should go. Return to top
- We can not go upstairs.

38:29.542 --> 38:31.853
We can not leave.

38:32.331 --> 38:36.364
We just go around, right?

38:49.150 --> 38:51.434
It's just along here.

38:57.984 --> 39:00.060
Just continue to follow.
- Good.

39:00.105 --> 39:03.489
Just stay behind me
if you are concerned.

39:03.524 --> 39:06.836
Have you seen it in the dark?
-. I do not know

39:06.871 --> 39:12.020
I saw it only from above,
I got it off here.

39:13.441 --> 39:15.666
Let's go further.

39:16.122 --> 39:20.441
I'm not going along.
I can not even see the end of it.

39:20.591 --> 39:22.718
We have to, is the only place
where we have not been.

39:22.763 --> 39:25.644
No, I do not.
- Come here, look at me.

39:25.645 --> 39:29.519
Do not you think you can do that?
- I think I can do it ...

39:29.554 --> 39:32.849
but I do not know.
I just do not want to go back.

39:34.424 --> 39:38.091
Put that down and
take my camera.

39:39.216 --> 39:44.215
Do you remember how to zoom?
- Yes.

39:47.547 --> 39:51.105
Seems a taakje for Clyde.

39:59.697 --> 40:02.007
The remote address.

40:03.137 --> 40:05.469
Well, here we go.

40:26.765 --> 40:28.933
What is that?
- What?

40:28.968 --> 40:31.189
Wait a moment I drive back.

40:32.100 --> 40:33.916
It is ... a baseball cap.

40:34.186 --> 40:35.442
Careful.

40:36.356 --> 40:38.322
I'm going straight.

40:43.422 --> 40:46.030
What is that?

40:52.902 --> 40:55.140
That is creepy.

40:56.142 --> 40:57.692
It is a shoe.

40:57.727 --> 41:00.708
Wait, I'm going along.
- No, Jim, there is someone.

41:00.743 --> 41:02.880
I know, wait.
I'm around.

41:19.799 --> 41:22.577
No.
- Okay, it's Earl, right?

41:22.612 --> 41:26.373
Let's get out of here.
- Well, I pick up the material.

41:30.577 --> 41:33.805
Stay right behind me, okay?
Stay close.

41:33.840 --> 41:35.655
Come on.

41:37.499 --> 41:38.659
I come.

41:40.144 --> 41:41.671
Come on.
Quickly.

42:00.471 --> 42:03.517
Welcome to amateur hour.

42:04.280 --> 42:08.555
That girl is probably still sue me.

42:10.046 --> 42:14.453
Just because she was a bit hysterical.

42:15.138 --> 42:19.106
Could be better Kris calls and
inform him about that bitch.

42:19.414 --> 42:21.023
Hello?

42:23.163 --> 42:25.397
Are you there?

42:31.859 --> 42:35.392
Wherever I go,
it seems as if someone follows me.

42:41.663 --> 42:44.750
The echo here is really a plague.

42:44.785 --> 42:48.682
And then I have it here for 15 minutes
needs a shirt to change.

42:51.864 --> 42:54.668
What the hell is that?

42:56.336 --> 42:58.004
Hello?

43:07.014 --> 43:09.292
Look at that.

43:17.275 --> 43:18.631
What the hell?

43:18.878 --> 43:21.230
Let me go.
No.

43:21.832 --> 43:23.543
Let me go.

43:38.369 --> 43:40.753
What is there blood?

43:40.788 --> 43:42.527
Where is she?

43:45.374 --> 43:49.799
What happened?
- I saw Adam be dragged into the hallway.

43:49.834 --> 43:51.083
Wait ...
- Where?

43:51.128 --> 43:53.796
Yes ... He was ...
I do not know, I did not see anyone.

43:53.831 --> 43:55.725
He was dragged away ...
- What happened.

43:55.760 --> 43:58.565
Jackie, is everything okay?
What just happened?

43:58.600 --> 44:03.045
I just saw Adam there in the hallway
was dragged away.

44:03.080 --> 44:04.887
What?
-. I do not know I do not know what I saw.

44:04.932 --> 44:06.637
He was just dragged ...
- We gotta get outta here.

44:06.672 --> 44:10.302
No, I'm not leaving here. I sit here.
- Did you say that Adam was dead?

44:10.337 --> 44:12.123
No.
- We need to check.

44:12.158 --> 44:13.729
We have to check.
- No, guys.

44:13.764 --> 44:17.076
Jim and I were down
Earl and we have seen there, dead.

44:17.111 --> 44:21.269
There is also Earl something happened, so
something or someone is here.

44:21.304 --> 44:23.723
We do not know how long that is already dead,
but he is as dead as a pier.

44:23.758 --> 44:25.993
I'm going to find another way out.
- I'm going to find Adam, we go down.

44:26.332 --> 44:28.219
And we do that we're out here.
- I'm not ...

44:28.297 --> 44:31.542
Jim, where is that blood, there?
- We do not know how much time we have ...

44:31.577 --> 44:34.724
we need him. Good?
We have to find him now.

44:34.759 --> 44:37.311
Jackie, no, come with us.
- I'm not going there.

44:37.346 --> 44:41.163
I do not want ...
- You have to go. Jen, we should go.

44:41.198 --> 44:43.378
I'm not.

44:58.207 --> 45:00.545
We know he's been here. Along

45:07.927 --> 45:10.117
That's his camera.

45:10.152 --> 45:12.911
Take it.

45:33.219 --> 45:36.419
It is in this direction.
Let's continue.

45:44.411 --> 45:46.319
Did you hear?

45:53.409 --> 45:55.959
Look at the wall.
Look.

46:02.156 --> 46:04.073
Where does that go?

46:19.833 --> 46:23.585
Jackie is all alone down there.
She's out there all alone.

46:23.620 --> 46:26.221
Dude, we have to find Adam ...
- After seeing this, we can not leave her alone.

46:26.256 --> 46:29.673
You're not leaving?
- You have two of them.

46:29.708 --> 46:31.667
I'll be right back.
- Sarah there is still too.

46:31.712 --> 46:34.107
She is just down the stairs.
I'll be right back.

46:41.226 --> 46:45.049
What are you doing?
- I did not want to stay alone.

46:45.588 --> 46:49.947
This is just very strange.
Look.

46:49.992 --> 46:53.591
Guys, I want out of here, okay.
- Yes, we.

46:57.278 --> 47:01.923
Then we put a camera right there in?
- Why should we place a camera?

47:01.958 --> 47:06.053
That's where that damn thing.
- If he is still alive ...

47:06.088 --> 47:09.593
we need to find him.
- Jim, come on.

47:09.628 --> 47:12.613
Put it at the top of a camera.
- What, me?

47:12.648 --> 47:14.949
Fuck, I'm not in it.

47:14.984 --> 47:16.817
Forward.

47:18.039 --> 47:21.211
Perhaps he himself comes down.
- Oh, yes.

47:21.246 --> 47:25.019
It's not a good idea to go there.
- He can not go anywhere.

47:26.132 --> 47:28.747
Jackie we need to hold you?

47:30.079 --> 47:31.837
Begin to it.

47:40.689 --> 47:41.933
What?

47:44.482 --> 47:47.089
Wait, I'll get it.
Stay there.

47:56.754 --> 48:00.472
I do not think you should go, Jim therein.

48:04.603 --> 48:10.076
I do not think you should.
- I'm not going in there, it'll just make the camera.

48:10.111 --> 48:13.900
Apparent even some light here.
- We need to find out.

48:13.944 --> 48:17.428
He may be an asshole,
but I will not leave him here.

48:17.463 --> 48:19.621
Be careful, okay?

48:38.125 --> 48:42.791
Nobody likes him.
Why are we doing this?

48:49.600 --> 48:51.296
Where does it go?
- Nowhere.

48:51.297 --> 48:54.841
It just leads nowhere,
it just stops, I see nothing.

48:54.901 --> 48:59.459
Wait ...
- I see nothing, nothing.

48:59.504 --> 49:01.009
There is nothing to see.

50:21.503 --> 50:22.704
What?

50:26.409 --> 50:28.227
Forward.

50:33.659 --> 50:34.933
Come on.

50:36.077 --> 50:38.211
He's here.

50:39.425 --> 50:41.288
Pack light.

51:14.441 --> 51:16.115
We have to leave here.

51:20.183 --> 51:23.155
We can not stay here,
we have to go.

51:24.527 --> 51:26.697
We have to get out of here.

51:27.590 --> 51:29.935
We have to leave.
- I'm sorry, she's right.

51:29.980 --> 51:31.409
We have to leave here.

51:31.444 --> 51:34.141
We would not be here if
what is inside comes out, right?

51:34.176 --> 51:36.075
We must go.

51:36.621 --> 51:38.899
I'm sorry, dude.

51:39.514 --> 51:41.523
We must go.

51:42.987 --> 51:45.738
Come on, Jackie, come on.

51:45.783 --> 51:47.769
Stay close.
- Okay.

51:53.580 --> 51:55.427
Where is the key?

51:55.600 --> 51:58.055
What's his name again?

51:59.302 --> 52:03.009
Wake up.
- Get the fuck up once.

52:03.054 --> 52:05.057
Open the door.

52:10.751 --> 52:15.073
Come on.
- Can anyone hear us?

52:15.108 --> 52:18.514
Somebody help us?

52:18.549 --> 52:20.767
Let us find a window.

52:20.802 --> 52:22.031
Here.

52:27.602 --> 52:29.703
Try that again?

52:30.132 --> 52:31.265
Come on.

52:31.300 --> 52:33.200
We're trapped.

52:34.284 --> 52:35.575
Beware.

52:42.474 --> 52:47.334
Come on.
- There's nothing here.

52:48.742 --> 52:51.033
We are caught, this is ...

52:58.379 --> 53:01.470
Come here.
Shine light on this door.

53:06.996 --> 53:08.845
But a dash is enough.

53:11.571 --> 53:14.212
Shine light on that slot.

53:24.981 --> 53:27.019
Try it here.

53:28.185 --> 53:29.285
Wait.

53:39.499 --> 53:40.849
Well, come on.

53:42.757 --> 53:46.144
What is that?
- That's an incubator.

53:46.265 --> 53:48.795
This looks like a main entrance for ...

54:02.091 --> 54:03.735
Let's get out of here.

54:06.299 --> 54:10.423
Look up.
For ventilation shafts.

54:15.151 --> 54:17.777
Who does this all add up?

54:25.411 --> 54:29.227
All these bird cages everywhere.

54:29.311 --> 54:31.185
Windows.

54:32.425 --> 54:35.539
There you can not recover.
- There are also iron rods.

54:36.141 --> 54:37.805
There are iron bars.

54:38.190 --> 54:40.687
We could not by others,
it goes with these also fail.

54:40.787 --> 54:43.109
What's this?
- What?

54:45.371 --> 54:47.551
This is still alive.

54:54.809 --> 54:56.167
What?

54:57.767 --> 55:00.149
Look at the ring.

55:00.611 --> 55:04.413
This is Adam.
- How did Adam's finger in it?

55:09.236 --> 55:11.731
Along here.
Follow the light.

55:19.727 --> 55:23.956
Here we were just as well.
- Of course. We've been everywhere.

55:24.091 --> 55:27.233
All times even 20.
- What should we do?

55:27.268 --> 55:28.993
I do not know.

55:31.891 --> 55:35.285
There must be a way out of this building.

55:35.320 --> 55:37.923
We just have to figure out a different way.

55:38.787 --> 55:40.315
There is no other way,
we are trapped.

55:40.365 --> 55:43.703
There must be another way.
- We're trapped.

55:46.487 --> 55:50.899
Do you ever seen any other way?
- We just try to think about it, Jackie.

55:52.349 --> 55:55.793
Oh, come on.
- We've been in every room.

55:55.828 --> 55:58.047
Come on.
- Not in every room.

55:58.082 --> 56:00.352
Do not talk so loud.

56:00.387 --> 56:04.813
Think about it for a moment? There must be a way
to come. through that gate

56:04.814 --> 56:07.688
That's the closest we ...
We could at least look outside.

56:07.723 --> 56:12.120
Was a key set there?
- No. - Yes, I was thinking just to.

56:12.574 --> 56:14.846
No, there is no second set.

56:15.390 --> 56:20.134
Adam had the keys.
- But we do not know where he is.

56:20.169 --> 56:25.065
Yes, surely ... about.
- Keep your voices do something quieter.

56:25.100 --> 56:28.150
We need to look at.
- We have to go look.

56:28.185 --> 56:32.088
Is not gonna happen, you guys are idiots.
- Jackie, what do you do? Die here?

56:32.123 --> 56:36.126
You are not really helpful.
- We need to get the keys.

56:40.780 --> 56:43.074
You are dummies.
- Do not move.

56:43.534 --> 56:47.268
I have terrible headaches.

56:47.844 --> 56:49.708
Here it is the blood.

56:50.060 --> 56:51.972
Careful.

56:56.244 --> 56:58.752
Here it is.
- What do we do now?

57:00.448 --> 57:02.642
Someone has it.

57:03.543 --> 57:05.412
How do you know that is not there?

57:07.252 --> 57:08.796
Go on up.
- What?

57:08.831 --> 57:11.674
Stop being a pussy and go upstairs.
- Yes, is not gonna work.

57:11.709 --> 57:14.730
No, you know what?
She's right, we do not know who it is.

57:14.765 --> 57:17.687
Maybe no one should go there.
I will use Clyde.

57:17.722 --> 57:20.012
And he can figure it out for us.
- No.

57:20.057 --> 57:23.798
That will take too long.
- Where's my remote control?

57:23.833 --> 57:27.262
That's better, really.
- He did not, no one should go into it.

57:27.307 --> 57:30.671
Go get it now.
- What do when occupants who are not?

57:54.135 --> 57:57.135
Jackie, hold.
- I make once anyone here side.

57:59.991 --> 58:04.633
Here, I'll do it.
- Careful.

58:04.668 --> 58:06.801
He's on?
- Yes.

58:09.938 --> 58:11.420
Good.

58:12.519 --> 58:15.270
We are halfway there.

58:15.305 --> 58:19.651
Well done, thank you.
- Thanks to all to question.

58:20.774 --> 58:22.470
Well, he drives.

58:45.508 --> 58:47.648
We come back from the other side.

59:01.704 --> 59:04.620
There is a shoe.
- The shoe of Adam.

59:13.423 --> 59:15.668
There he is. He is there.

59:16.406 --> 59:19.412
Wait, I'm going to drive around and see if ...

59:19.447 --> 59:21.678
I see are the keys.

59:30.383 --> 59:32.558
I'm going to vomit.

59:40.686 --> 59:43.046
That's all right.
- I'm not going up there.

59:43.365 --> 59:46.708
That's not good.
- For us though, he has the keys.

59:46.753 --> 59:48.796
I'm not.
- Someone has to go.

59:48.831 --> 59:51.550
You go.
- Shut up.

59:56.164 --> 59:57.888
Dave, you should go.

59:57.923 --> 01:00:00.965
What? No.
- I do not think one of us two to pass through.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.020
There he says what ..

01:00:04.296 --> 01:00:07.232
Jackie must go.

01:00:07.267 --> 01:00:09.856
No, I'm not.
- Really? Should I say it?

01:00:09.891 --> 01:00:13.314
Here's an idea.
You deserve double us.

01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:16.022
Be a man and go myself.
- Jackie, it will not do it.

01:00:16.057 --> 01:00:19.094
Yes, it does.
What is wrong with you?

01:00:19.124 --> 01:00:22.002
Calm down a minute.
- Even and odd?

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:25.775
Shut up and be quiet.
We do Even and Odd.

01:00:25.810 --> 01:00:28.771
Everyone does it.
- All right, listen.

01:00:28.806 --> 01:00:31.732
Even clarify
so we should not twice ...

01:00:31.767 --> 01:00:34.634
One, two, three ... ready.

01:00:34.669 --> 01:00:38.448
Only one and a-two.
Not more one and two.

01:00:39.548 --> 01:00:40.842
Then we go for it.

01:00:40.877 --> 01:00:43.426
One, two, three ... ready.

01:00:43.461 --> 01:00:44.886
Thank God.

01:00:52.528 --> 01:00:54.764
Jackie, we'll be here.

01:00:54.799 --> 01:00:57.458
We will light shine for you.
- Just quickly in and out again, right?

01:00:57.493 --> 01:00:59.048
Fast.

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:03.563
You guys are unbelievable.
- Remain silent.

01:01:07.071 --> 01:01:09.328
Careful.

01:01:10.592 --> 01:01:13.460
How do you ... go?
- No ... Okay.

01:01:16.372 --> 01:01:17.986
That's gross.

01:01:18.021 --> 01:01:21.140
Give her a camera.
- Here.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.622
That was rude.
- Here, look.

01:01:24.667 --> 01:01:26.670
Use that there with the light.

01:01:28.422 --> 01:01:31.267
It's okay.
Just use the light.

01:01:31.302 --> 01:01:34.908
Go in there, get the keys.
And then we're out of here.

01:02:03.758 --> 01:02:06.798
We do not know how her
from here can give a direction.

01:02:06.833 --> 01:02:09.394
Hopefully she can just see it.

01:02:09.429 --> 01:02:10.864
Clyde.

01:02:15.515 --> 01:02:18.519
We will only see her when she is there.

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:49.764
There she is.

01:03:06.831 --> 01:03:09.961
Did you see that?
- That was just a reflection.

01:03:10.482 --> 01:03:11.932
No, I see it too.

01:03:15.552 --> 01:03:17.878
Wait.

01:03:20.948 --> 01:03:23.278
I do not think they can hear you.
Louder.

01:03:26.243 --> 01:03:28.060
They are not here.

01:03:28.231 --> 01:03:30.774
There is someone there.

01:03:35.218 --> 01:03:38.774
I do not see anyone.

01:03:38.809 --> 01:03:42.560
Behind you.
He's just there.

01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:46.141
I see nothing.
There's no one here.

01:03:46.176 --> 01:03:49.282
Yes, it does.
Your right.

01:03:52.042 --> 01:03:56.098
I can not.
- They just look through him.

01:03:56.133 --> 01:03:58.192
I do not see anyone.

01:03:58.227 --> 01:04:00.208
He's just there.

01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:10.650
What happened?
- We have to go.

01:04:11.732 --> 01:04:15.094
She could not see m
and he was just there.

01:04:25.296 --> 01:04:27.154
What is that?

01:04:30.610 --> 01:04:31.887
What the hell is that?

01:04:31.932 --> 01:04:34.854
What is it?
-. I do not know

01:04:34.899 --> 01:04:36.308
Come on, let's go.

01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:42.286
I will not stay here.

01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:51.780
What there is,
is better than what was there.

01:04:51.815 --> 01:04:54.754
There you can enter into on.

01:04:55.658 --> 01:04:57.698
Come on.
Stay there.

01:04:58.688 --> 01:05:00.144
Stop.

01:05:07.528 --> 01:05:09.190
Go ahead.

01:05:15.644 --> 01:05:18.062
Forward.
- No, no.

01:05:20.323 --> 01:05:22.895
There's a guy who cut my throat.
- We gotta get outta here.

01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:24.759
What are you talking about?
- Over there is someone ...

01:05:25.633 --> 01:05:29.407
Mike, everyone is dead.
- We gotta get outta here.

01:05:29.457 --> 01:05:32.830
We must go down.
- I can not see.

01:05:32.875 --> 01:05:35.472
How do we know that you 'm're not?
- I do not know who 'm.

01:05:35.507 --> 01:05:38.029
Why should I cut my own throat?

01:05:41.399 --> 01:05:44.979
I just go jump off.
I'm really not inside.

01:05:45.028 --> 01:05:48.018
We need to get the front windows
and the door. Who has the keys?

01:05:48.053 --> 01:05:52.794
We have tried.
- There are no keys.

01:05:52.829 --> 01:05:55.086
We do not know.
- They're gone.

01:05:55.121 --> 01:05:59.227
The gate is locked.
You've done locked the gate itself ...

01:05:59.228 --> 01:06:02.957
There is nothing ...
Jump off here, you're dead.

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:05.946
Well, we must go back.
- I have a bolt cutter.

01:06:05.981 --> 01:06:09.008
A bolt cutter. Then I cut the lock.
- Is that above you?

01:06:09.043 --> 01:06:11.512
Lying at my tools.
- Wait a minute.

01:06:11.674 --> 01:06:14.553
Where is your bolt cutters?
- In my tool down.

01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:17.904
In the basement?
- Yes, in the basement.

01:06:17.935 --> 01:06:21.281
I do not know where is Earl.
I do not know where everyone is.

01:06:22.356 --> 01:06:26.406
Are you sure you get the door open?
- That I just cut open, right?

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:30.252
Headed straight down, boys.

01:06:30.287 --> 01:06:32.354
Go fast.

01:06:42.698 --> 01:06:44.736
What?
- Stay closer.

01:06:44.737 --> 01:06:47.631
Come on, we gotta get the bolt cutters.

01:06:59.388 --> 01:07:02.888
You can not do it, dude.
- What do you say?

01:07:02.923 --> 01:07:06.652
I thought you were right behind me.
- We need to figure out how we do this.

01:07:06.687 --> 01:07:08.517
That's Speck.

01:07:09.383 --> 01:07:14.547
That is not. Speck
- It's fucking Speck. Who else?

01:07:14.548 --> 01:07:18.682
Wait, she's right.
- The birds.

01:07:18.717 --> 01:07:23.676
The birds. What was that about birds?
- Speck kept birds in his cell.

01:07:23.711 --> 01:07:28.618
And we have seen those birds in that room.
- Adam's finger lying in the cage.

01:07:28.653 --> 01:07:33.771
That does not look good.
- No, really?

01:07:33.821 --> 01:07:38.644
Did you see that there, with the hole in the ceiling?
What was that sometimes?

01:07:39.066 --> 01:07:45.124
The blood trail just walked up on the wall.
That's not normal, that's impossible.

01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:49.763
What is that?

01:07:50.826 --> 01:07:53.634
What is that?
- I know what that is.

01:07:53.669 --> 01:07:58.677
Those are the lines. That can happen.
How do I get to the tool there?

01:07:58.678 --> 01:07:59.961
Come on.

01:08:02.483 --> 01:08:04.940
This really sucks.

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:12.856
This is the corridor there. Forward.
- Earl is there too.

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:15.348
Forward.
- Come on.

01:08:17.841 --> 01:08:19.795
You go.

01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:24.527
I do not know what you think.
But there he is.

01:08:24.608 --> 01:08:26.319
I'm not.

01:08:26.354 --> 01:08:29.591
What do you mean you're not.
- We will not.

01:08:29.627 --> 01:08:35.068
You know how many people there are others
killed? They are flesh and blood ...

01:08:35.103 --> 01:08:39.095
and in all prisons, more is not good?
- Shall I go with him?

01:08:39.145 --> 01:08:40.411
No, no.

01:08:41.301 --> 01:08:46.298
Come back soon, good.
- I can not see anything, to return soon.

01:08:46.486 --> 01:08:49.952
Yeah, right.
Here, take this.

01:08:50.858 --> 01:08:53.881
Be careful.
- I'll be right back.

01:08:53.917 --> 01:08:56.444
Wait ...
- What?

01:08:56.488 --> 01:08:57.859
Infrared.

01:08:58.505 --> 01:09:03.810
You can see the infrared Speck.
- Oh, great. How exciting.

01:09:05.587 --> 01:09:08.520
What?
- Betonschaar and get right back, okay?

01:09:08.555 --> 01:09:10.631
Nothing else touch.

01:09:12.251 --> 01:09:14.464
Look in the viewfinder.

01:09:14.573 --> 01:09:17.705
I film it,
I can see nothing else.

01:09:21.348 --> 01:09:23.493
Do you think it will succeed him?

01:09:23.538 --> 01:09:25.459
No idea.

01:09:36.578 --> 01:09:41.336
They send me here all alone back.
Come on.

01:09:41.371 --> 01:09:44.192
You guys are unbelievable.

01:09:44.689 --> 01:09:47.203
I can barely see it.

01:09:47.626 --> 01:09:49.187
A camera.

01:09:50.109 --> 01:09:53.072
I better use a lighter.

01:09:55.752 --> 01:09:57.442
What is ...

01:09:58.857 --> 01:10:00.336
Earl?

01:10:09.529 --> 01:10:11.716
My buddy, Earl?

01:10:14.524 --> 01:10:16.108
Hello?

01:10:17.803 --> 01:10:21.222
What is that?

01:10:23.486 --> 01:10:24.906
Come here.

01:10:25.262 --> 01:10:27.817
What are you doing?

01:10:39.162 --> 01:10:40.606
What is that?

01:10:56.646 --> 01:10:59.677
We must go.

01:10:59.712 --> 01:11:03.178
There lies the bolt cutters,
we need to get there, boys.

01:11:03.679 --> 01:11:07.068
We can not go there.
- We need to get there.

01:11:11.389 --> 01:11:13.242
Come on.

01:11:21.188 --> 01:11:22.429
Forward.

01:11:35.202 --> 01:11:37.252
Wait.

01:11:41.108 --> 01:11:42.536
There ... here ...

01:11:52.127 --> 01:11:53.422
Caution.

01:11:55.576 --> 01:11:57.989
Pack light.
- What are you doing?

01:11:58.024 --> 01:12:00.416
Barricade the door.

01:12:00.705 --> 01:12:02.716
What do you do?
- The window.

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:04.567
Wait ...
Pushing.

01:12:09.589 --> 01:12:11.184
Be careful.

01:12:21.538 --> 01:12:25.312
Jim, do it lightly.
Turn on the light.

01:12:28.336 --> 01:12:31.062
He is hot.

01:12:31.097 --> 01:12:33.472
Wait.
He is hot.

01:12:34.553 --> 01:12:37.044
Are you kidding me?

01:12:37.584 --> 01:12:40.019
We have to let it cool.

01:12:46.536 --> 01:12:50.270
It must be cool.
- Wait ... What is that?

01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:54.709
What is that? That's not me.
- What?

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:07.138
Put the light on.
- Do the damn light.

01:13:27.938 --> 01:13:30.679
Come on, keep moving.
Follow.

01:13:31.837 --> 01:13:34.604
Dave, come on dude.

01:13:38.592 --> 01:13:40.532
What?

01:14:08.396 --> 01:14:11.328
Hold on.

01:14:31.496 --> 01:14:34.814
You fucking fagot, you show.

01:14:34.849 --> 01:14:37.064
You bastard.

01:14:38.358 --> 01:14:41.698
Why do not you, you coward.

01:15:15.424 --> 01:15:17.069
Look at me.

01:15:17.396 --> 01:15:19.095
Look at me.

01:15:22.628 --> 01:15:24.697
We have to leave here.

01:15:24.742 --> 01:15:27.062
We can not go anywhere.
- We're out of here.

01:15:27.097 --> 01:15:29.380
No, not yet.
- Yes, it does.

01:15:29.415 --> 01:15:32.908
We are not going to die here, look at me.
- No one else is ...

01:15:32.953 --> 01:15:36.656
No, Jim.
We go away together.

01:15:36.691 --> 01:15:39.976
We get out of here.
- Where can we go?

01:15:40.021 --> 01:15:42.704
There is a way out of here, I know,
I'm not going to die here.

01:15:42.739 --> 01:15:44.770
Look at me.

01:15:44.805 --> 01:15:48.382
We're out of here.
We now go away.

01:15:48.417 --> 01:15:52.486
We're here now.
Come here.

01:15:56.598 --> 01:16:01.601
Come on, please.
You're all I have left.

01:16:01.636 --> 01:16:05.541
Please, do it for me.
You must stand up for me.

01:16:05.576 --> 01:16:07.606
Please.
Arise.

01:16:10.449 --> 01:16:12.686
Please help me.

01:16:14.599 --> 01:16:17.292
I need you.

01:16:23.610 --> 01:16:27.006
Come on, let's go.
- I'm sorry, buddy.

01:16:33.963 --> 01:16:38.226
We walk in circles.
- I know you're tired.

01:16:38.261 --> 01:16:42.776
We must continue.
- Again to the base camp, we have been there.

01:16:42.811 --> 01:16:47.632
Dave would like to leave.
- Dave is suspended. We have to get Dave.

01:16:47.667 --> 01:16:50.200
We have to take him.

01:16:50.235 --> 01:16:53.560
No, Jim, do it for Dave.

01:16:56.316 --> 01:16:58.687
We must continue.

01:17:03.443 --> 01:17:06.675
What is that?
-. I do not know Grab the camera.

01:17:09.516 --> 01:17:11.499
Stay here.

01:17:11.902 --> 01:17:13.995
Where are you?

01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:17.590
Show yourself, asshole.
Where are you?

01:17:18.215 --> 01:17:19.969
No, Jim.

01:17:20.004 --> 01:17:23.853
What is that? What is going on?
- I can not get it open.

01:17:38.695 --> 01:17:41.891
Go away.
Go on, get out.

01:17:41.926 --> 01:17:44.149
Come on, run.

01:20:27.621 --> 01:20:29.551
I know how to get out of here.

01:20:29.586 --> 01:20:31.939
Come on.

01:20:40.019 --> 01:20:43.413
Just through here.
We're gonna get out of here.

Do not leave me alone.
- I will not leave you alone. We go here.

01:20:47.689 --> 01:20:52.103
Back where we came along.
Remember when we were here?

01:20:55.223 --> 01:20:59.327
Come here.
Baby, stay with me here.

01:21:04.015 --> 01:21:05.895

We go here.
We now go away.

01:21:16.762 --> 01:21:18.875
Do you know this yet?

01:21:19.764 --> 01:21:21.923
Now we are really here.

01:21:26.165 --> 01:21:29.883
Climb through. Good?

01:21:30.532 --> 01:21:33.393
Yes?
