00:57.398 --> 01:00.401
I had
this image of you...

01:00.485 --> 01:05.823
inside of me,
like a part of me.

01:10.703 --> 01:12.455
You planned
this whole thing.

01:12.539 --> 01:15.375
We make our own choices.
We pay our own prices.

01:15.458 --> 01:17.752
5 years is a long time.

01:17.835 --> 01:20.713
Where's the fucking money?

01:26.886 --> 01:31.600
- All part of the business.
- All part of the business.

01:31.851 --> 01:35.938
- You made a choice once.
- What choice?

01:38.774 --> 01:41.277
I want out.

01:55.291 --> 01:57.793
Like a part of me.

01:59.568 --> 02:01.236
Hold the elevator.

02:05.175 --> 02:07.218
Thanks.

03:04.735 --> 03:07.196
Yeah. I looked over
everything, sir,

03:07.279 --> 03:10.282
and I don't think there
should be any problems.

03:10.741 --> 03:13.911
Yes, sir. I ordered the vanity,
and I looked at the tub.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.413
I'm pretty sure
we could rout it out.

03:19.416 --> 03:21.043
Yeah.

03:21.126 --> 03:23.003
Yeah. I'll start everything
first thing tomorrow.

03:23.087 --> 03:25.422
Yeah.

03:28.676 --> 03:33.848
Thanks again for this
opportunity, Mr Bianchinni.

03:33.931 --> 03:36.684
Yeah.

03:59.958 --> 04:04.337
Hi. My name's Violet.
We sort of met on the elevator.

04:05.922 --> 04:08.842
- I'm Corky.
- Corky.

04:08.925 --> 04:10.510
Well, I heard you
working in here,

04:10.594 --> 04:14.805
and I was wondering
if you'd like a cup of coffee.

04:14.889 --> 04:16.055
Sure.

04:16.140 --> 04:17.349
Come on in.

04:17.433 --> 04:20.853
- Just give me a second.
- All right.

04:27.193 --> 04:28.944
So, what happened to Rajeev?

04:29.028 --> 04:32.406
He went back home
to India or someplace,

04:32.489 --> 04:34.200
but I think he'll be back.

04:34.283 --> 04:36.744
So, it's just a
temporary situation for you?

04:36.827 --> 04:38.412
Yeah. Pretty much.

04:38.495 --> 04:40.206
You know, one day at a time.

04:40.289 --> 04:43.543
Hmm. I guessed you were
straight black.

04:43.627 --> 04:48.840
- Good guess. Thanks.
- My pleasure.

04:48.924 --> 04:53.428
To be perfectly honest,
I did have an ulterior motive.

04:53.512 --> 04:55.931
I was wondering if I might
ask you a little favour.

04:56.014 --> 04:58.016
- Favour?
- Yeah.

04:58.099 --> 04:59.768
I'm kind of a night person,

04:59.851 --> 05:02.729
and I was wondering if you
might wait a little bit

05:02.812 --> 05:04.981
before you start
using the power tools.

05:05.065 --> 05:08.693
- Uh, sorry.
- Oh, no, it's not your fault.

05:08.777 --> 05:12.864
It's just the walls here
are so terribly thin.

05:12.948 --> 05:14.616
Really?

05:14.699 --> 05:17.285
It's like you're
in the same room.

05:17.369 --> 05:19.412
If it's too much
trouble, I understand.

05:19.496 --> 05:20.997
No. It's no trouble at all.

05:21.081 --> 05:22.415
I got a lot of stuff to do here.

05:22.499 --> 05:25.210
You doing all the work yourself?

05:25.293 --> 05:27.963
- Mmm.
- That is so amazing.

05:28.046 --> 05:32.217
I am so in awe of people
who can fix things.

05:32.300 --> 05:36.972
My dad was like that.
We never had anything new.

05:37.055 --> 05:38.974
Whenever anything was broken,

05:39.057 --> 05:41.226
he would just open it up,

05:41.309 --> 05:45.146
tinker with it
a little bit and fix it.

05:45.230 --> 05:48.609
His hands were magic.

05:49.986 --> 05:52.196
I'll bet your car
is 20 years old.

05:52.280 --> 05:56.784
- Truck.
- Truck? Of course.

05:56.868 --> 06:00.121
- '63 Chevy.
- I knew it.

06:03.916 --> 06:07.670
Well, I guess I should be going.

06:07.753 --> 06:11.173
You can drop the cup off
at any time.

06:12.592 --> 06:13.926
Thanks.

06:15.803 --> 06:17.263
My pleasure.

06:28.231 --> 06:33.278
Well, well.
It's been a long time, Cork.

06:33.361 --> 06:36.740
5 years, 2 months, and 16 days.

06:36.823 --> 06:40.619
- How you doing, Sue?
- Like shit.

06:40.702 --> 06:43.163
Well, now that we're all caught
up, can I buy you a drink?

06:43.246 --> 06:44.456
Thanks.

06:47.209 --> 06:48.752
Welcome home.

06:53.716 --> 06:56.928
- So, did you get the job yet?
- Yeah.

06:57.011 --> 06:59.180
Some plumbing,
painting, and shit.

06:59.263 --> 07:05.061
I mean a j-o-b, a real job.

07:05.144 --> 07:08.648
Nope. Not for me, Sue.

07:08.731 --> 07:11.150
I'm just here to get laid.

07:37.635 --> 07:40.012
- Hi.
- Hello.

07:42.390 --> 07:44.433
Hey, Jesse,
what's happening here?

07:46.561 --> 07:51.482
- Wait. I know you.
- I don't think so.

07:51.566 --> 07:53.943
I didn't know you were out.

07:56.070 --> 08:00.951
When you get tired of
Cagney and Lacey, find me.

08:39.322 --> 08:43.159
# Nice and slow,
night and day

08:43.241 --> 08:47.955
#When you stop to think
it just gets in the way

08:48.039 --> 08:51.792
#And there's not
a single soul among us... #

08:56.380 --> 08:58.382
Yeah.

08:58.466 --> 09:00.510
Hey, Mr Bianchinni.

09:00.593 --> 09:03.222
Yeah, everything's
going just fine.

09:03.305 --> 09:07.059
Yeah. I got the tub drain
all cleaned out.

09:08.519 --> 09:10.604
What apartment?

09:19.988 --> 09:21.532
Oh, no.

09:21.615 --> 09:24.826
Shit. I didn't know
he would call you.

09:24.910 --> 09:27.746
You must think
I'm a total nuisance.

09:27.829 --> 09:29.373
Not exactly.

09:29.456 --> 09:33.043
Sorry, I'd usually call Rajeev,
but I didn't know what to do,

09:33.126 --> 09:37.339
- so I called Mr Bianchinni.
- He said you lost something?

09:37.422 --> 09:40.717
Yeah. Come on in.

09:46.014 --> 09:49.434
I was doing the dishes, and
just as I pulled the stopper,

09:49.518 --> 09:51.520
my earring fell in.

09:51.603 --> 09:54.982
That's why I got upset.
It's one of my favourites.

09:57.901 --> 09:59.695
You got a pot or a bucket?

10:33.897 --> 10:35.899
Did you find it?

10:39.401 --> 10:44.323
Oh, my God. I can't believe it.
I can't thank you enough.

10:44.406 --> 10:48.076
You have to let me
pay you something.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.704
- No.
- No?

10:50.787 --> 10:53.707
I told Bianchinni
I'd do it. I did it.

10:53.790 --> 10:57.419
Well, if you won't take money,
how about a drink?

10:58.212 --> 11:01.173
You can't work all night.

11:04.134 --> 11:06.178
All right.

11:09.431 --> 11:12.852
- One drink.
- What would you like?

11:12.936 --> 11:18.274
- Beer.
- Beer. Of course.

11:26.908 --> 11:28.993
Sit down.

11:44.717 --> 11:48.638
- Thanks.
- You seem uncomfortable.

11:48.721 --> 11:52.600
- Do I make you nervous, Corky?
- No.

11:53.977 --> 11:59.858
- Thirsty, maybe.
- Curious, maybe.

11:59.941 --> 12:01.192
That's funny.

12:01.276 --> 12:04.737
I'm feeling a little bit
curious myself.

12:06.781 --> 12:08.992
That's a great tattoo.

12:13.204 --> 12:15.291
Beautiful labarus.

12:15.374 --> 12:17.710
Are you surprised
I know what it is?

12:17.793 --> 12:19.920
Maybe.

12:31.015 --> 12:35.477
I have a tattoo.
Would you like to see it?

12:40.858 --> 12:44.737
A woman in upstate New York
did it for me.

12:46.363 --> 12:48.531
Do you like it?

12:49.032 --> 12:51.951
Took her all day to do it.

12:53.077 --> 12:55.288
She promised
it wouldn't hurt, but...

12:56.623 --> 12:59.500
it was sore
for a long time after.

12:59.584 --> 13:02.503
I couldn't even touch it.

13:05.506 --> 13:07.592
But now I love
the way it feels.

13:11.596 --> 13:13.598
Here.

13:16.601 --> 13:18.645
Touch it.

13:27.321 --> 13:31.116
- What are you doing?
- Isn't it obvious?

13:32.785 --> 13:34.745
I'm trying to seduce you.

13:34.828 --> 13:40.543
- Why?
- Because I want to.

13:40.626 --> 13:44.380
I've wanted to ever since
I saw you in the elevator.

13:50.094 --> 13:55.391
I know you don't believe me,
but I can prove it to you.

14:02.439 --> 14:05.317
You can't believe
what you'd see?

14:06.360 --> 14:10.948
Can you believe... what you feel?

14:15.911 --> 14:19.373
I've been thinking
about you all day.

14:36.433 --> 14:39.769
You planned this whole thing.

14:39.853 --> 14:44.024
You dropped that earring down
the sink on purpose, didn't you?

14:44.107 --> 14:47.777
If I say yes,
will you take your hand away?

14:47.861 --> 14:51.448
- No.
- Yes.

14:54.576 --> 14:59.246
Please, Corky. Please.

15:00.581 --> 15:02.791
Kiss me.

15:31.321 --> 15:32.447
Oh, fuck!

15:36.409 --> 15:39.538
Violet! Vi, are you home?

15:39.621 --> 15:42.457
Yeah, I'm right here, Cea.

15:43.583 --> 15:46.294
What's this?
What the fuck is this?

15:46.378 --> 15:47.796
I didn't expect...

15:47.879 --> 15:50.048
What the fuck is...

15:52.759 --> 15:55.720
Corky, this is Caesar.
Caesar... Corky.

15:57.889 --> 16:00.225
I thought...

16:01.184 --> 16:03.270
Fucking dark in here.

16:04.271 --> 16:08.316
Corky's doing some work
for Mr Bianchinni.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.361
Oh, yeah, yeah. Right.
Don mentioned that to me.

16:11.444 --> 16:13.613
Uh... Iâ€™m sorry.

16:13.697 --> 16:16.867
Hi. Welcome to the family.

16:17.951 --> 16:20.412
So, uh, you're working
with Rajeev, right?

16:20.495 --> 16:23.123
No. Rajeev's in India.

16:23.206 --> 16:26.585
- She's doing the work herself.
- No shit.

16:26.668 --> 16:29.504
Bianchinni hired you. You
must be good with your hands.

16:29.588 --> 16:32.007
- He's a good friend.
- That's what Violet says.

16:32.090 --> 16:34.552
Family, really.

16:34.635 --> 16:37.013
- So, when did you get out?
- Jesus, Caesar.

16:37.096 --> 16:39.640
What? It ain't
no big fucking deal.

16:39.724 --> 16:41.851
I know who Don hires.

16:41.934 --> 16:46.731
You know, he did time himself.
13 fucking years.

16:46.814 --> 16:48.733
What did you do?

16:48.816 --> 16:52.695
- 5.
- 5. That's not bad.

16:52.778 --> 16:54.322
What for?

16:54.405 --> 16:56.782
None of your
goddamn business, Caesar.

16:56.866 --> 16:59.535
Right. It's none
of my goddamn business.

16:59.619 --> 17:02.205
You don't have to tell me.
Look, it's just...

17:02.288 --> 17:04.373
I want you to understand
one thing, all right?

17:04.457 --> 17:08.210
You're amongst good people here.

17:15.759 --> 17:18.220
Come on. Come on.

17:18.303 --> 17:21.598
If you understand what I'm
talking about, you'll take it.

17:21.681 --> 17:26.394
If you don't, then I'm
gonna have to worry about you.

17:29.314 --> 17:32.984
Good. I hate to worry.

17:33.068 --> 17:35.195
I got ulcers.

17:37.406 --> 17:40.076
- I should be going.
- Why?

17:40.159 --> 17:42.161
Nah. Stick around.
Get her a drink.

17:42.245 --> 17:44.705
No. I got to go
clean out my brushes.

17:44.789 --> 17:47.291
Another time.

17:47.375 --> 17:50.419
Right. Another time.

18:06.727 --> 18:09.730
Corky, Corky.

18:09.814 --> 18:11.899
What are you doing?

18:34.338 --> 18:39.802
- I had to see you.
- Look...

18:39.886 --> 18:41.638
I don't think
this is a good idea.

18:41.722 --> 18:48.896
- I wanted to apologise.
- Oh, please, don't apologise.

18:48.979 --> 18:52.107
I can't stand women
who apologise for wanting sex.

18:58.447 --> 19:01.533
I'm not apologising
for what I did.

19:01.617 --> 19:07.164
I'm apologising
for what I didn't do.

19:29.769 --> 19:32.772
You have a bed somewhere?

21:05.658 --> 21:08.828
I can see again.

21:26.929 --> 21:28.889
I needed that.

21:31.350 --> 21:35.521
- So Caesar's Mafia, huh?
- You have to ask?

21:35.604 --> 21:38.690
- No.
- Funny.

21:38.774 --> 21:40.984
Nobody really calls
it that anymore.

21:41.068 --> 21:43.195
Caesar just calls it
"The Business".

21:43.278 --> 21:48.534
- How d'you meet him?
- Took over a club I worked at.

21:48.617 --> 21:50.577
Caesar managed it.

21:50.661 --> 21:53.997
- He's a launderer?
- Basically.

21:54.081 --> 21:58.127
- How long you been with him?
- About 5 years.

22:00.213 --> 22:04.551
- 5 years is a long time.
- Yes, it is.

22:05.635 --> 22:09.556
- The redistribution of wealth.
- Excuse me?

22:09.639 --> 22:13.935
That's what you wanted to know,
isn't it? What I did time for?

22:14.018 --> 22:16.980
The redistribution of wealth?

22:17.063 --> 22:19.983
That's what I tell someone
I'm trying to get in my bed.

22:20.066 --> 22:22.819
But I'm already in your bed.

22:25.780 --> 22:29.409
My cellmate would say she did
her time for getting caught.

22:29.492 --> 22:32.036
She was always
a lot more honest than me.

22:32.120 --> 22:36.416
You didn't have to tell me
if you didn't want to.

22:36.499 --> 22:39.502
I guess I wanted to.

22:42.213 --> 22:47.260
- I'm glad you did.
- So am I.

22:54.726 --> 22:57.562
# Let me tell you
about a girl I know

22:57.645 --> 23:00.983
# She's my baby
and she lives next door

23:01.066 --> 23:04.069
# Every morning
before the sun comes up

23:04.153 --> 23:06.322
# She brings my coffee
in my favourite cup

23:06.405 --> 23:08.490
# That's why I know... #

23:08.574 --> 23:10.701
You think I don't know
that he's gone?

23:10.784 --> 23:12.453
Come on. Just...

23:12.536 --> 23:14.747
I have to leave tonight.

23:14.830 --> 23:17.416
Come on. Don't make
me beg, Violet.

23:17.499 --> 23:22.087
Oh, come... 2 Minutes. Da-dink.

23:34.974 --> 23:37.727
You look great.

23:50.114 --> 23:52.617
I had this image of you...

23:52.700 --> 23:54.619
inside of me,

23:54.702 --> 23:57.622
like a part of me.

23:59.499 --> 24:02.835
You are so beautiful.

24:05.214 --> 24:08.384
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

24:09.635 --> 24:10.845
Yes, there is.

24:10.928 --> 24:13.514
You didn't want
to see me, did you?

24:13.597 --> 24:16.934
If there's one thing I can't
stand about sleeping with women,

24:17.017 --> 24:18.936
it's all the fucking
mind reading.

24:20.271 --> 24:21.397
I don't understand.

24:21.480 --> 24:22.940
I know.

24:23.023 --> 24:24.900
Violet, that's because
you can't understand.

24:24.984 --> 24:26.068
We're different.

24:26.151 --> 24:28.404
We're not that different, Corky.

24:28.487 --> 24:31.407
Ahh, let's see.

24:31.490 --> 24:33.909
This is the part
where you tell me

24:33.993 --> 24:35.703
what matters is on the inside,

24:35.786 --> 24:37.913
and that inside of you,

24:37.997 --> 24:39.957
there's a little dyke
just like me.

24:40.040 --> 24:41.500
No, she's nothing like you.

24:41.584 --> 24:44.044
She's a whole lot
smarter than you are.

24:44.128 --> 24:46.130
Is that what
her daddy tells her?

24:46.213 --> 24:47.840
I know what I am.

24:47.923 --> 24:50.676
I don't have to have it
tattooed on my shoulder.

24:50.759 --> 24:53.012
What are you saying,
you don't have sex with men?

24:53.095 --> 24:54.805
I don't.

24:54.889 --> 24:59.310
For Christ's sake, Violet.
I heard you.

24:59.393 --> 25:01.270
Thin walls, remember?

25:01.353 --> 25:04.523
What you heard wasn't sex.

25:04.607 --> 25:09.487
- What the fuck was it?
- Work.

25:12.240 --> 25:15.660
You made certain choices
in your life that you paid for.

25:15.744 --> 25:19.289
You said you made them because
you were good at something

25:19.372 --> 25:21.374
and it was easy.

25:21.458 --> 25:23.877
Do you think you're the only
person that's good at something?

25:25.712 --> 25:29.299
We make our own choices.
We pay our own prices.

25:29.382 --> 25:32.135
I think we're more alike
than you care to admit.

25:32.219 --> 25:34.554
What about that guy
this morning?

25:34.638 --> 25:36.640
Who? Shelly?

25:36.723 --> 25:39.476
Don't tell me.
You're a workaholic.

25:39.559 --> 25:41.977
No. Shelly knows what I am.

25:42.061 --> 25:45.439
He saw me in a bar
with another woman.

25:45.523 --> 25:49.443
Yeah. I suppose he
just wants to watch.

25:49.527 --> 25:52.696
Fuck it. I think
you'd better leave.

25:52.780 --> 25:54.281
I think I'd better.

25:55.699 --> 25:58.744
Try not to steal anything
on the way out.

27:13.778 --> 27:16.698
Do you want to fuck me?

27:19.160 --> 27:21.579
I didn't do it.
I swear to you.

27:25.833 --> 27:27.835
Where's the fucking money?

27:27.919 --> 27:29.795
Please! Caesar!

27:29.879 --> 27:31.255
Where is it?

27:33.049 --> 27:36.469
Oh, that hurt, didn't it?

27:40.431 --> 27:42.141
Where's the fucking money?

27:42.225 --> 27:43.851
Jesus Christ, please!

27:43.935 --> 27:45.520
Please, Johnnie!

27:45.603 --> 27:48.523
Oh, please stop it!
Please stop it!

27:50.023 --> 27:51.983
Oh, don't make me beg!

27:53.527 --> 27:55.862
Oh, that hurt!

27:56.988 --> 27:58.448
Please stop what you're doing!

27:58.532 --> 28:01.451
- Do you want to fuck me?
- No! No! I'm sorry!

28:01.535 --> 28:03.912
We're going home,
you piece of shit!

28:03.995 --> 28:06.915
- Nobody fucks me!
- I'm not fucking you!

28:06.998 --> 28:08.833
I promise! I swear I'm not!

28:08.917 --> 28:10.335
Johnnie! Ho!

28:10.418 --> 28:11.878
Please!

28:11.962 --> 28:13.964
He's making too much noise.

28:14.047 --> 28:16.466
You hear that, bitch? Shut up.

28:19.177 --> 28:20.679
Give me a towel.

28:22.181 --> 28:23.933
Shut up!

28:24.016 --> 28:25.393
Here.

28:27.478 --> 28:29.188
Put it in his mouth!

28:42.910 --> 28:47.832
- Caesar, I'm leaving.
- What? Why?

28:47.915 --> 28:51.127
I didn't use a good towel.

28:51.210 --> 28:54.297
I'm serious. I can't take this.
I have to get out of here.

28:54.380 --> 28:58.676
Why? Because you know him?

28:59.343 --> 29:01.762
Oh, you see...

29:01.846 --> 29:04.724
Baby, that's what
I love about you.

29:04.807 --> 29:07.643
You're so fucking sensitive.

29:08.603 --> 29:10.688
But I like you here.

29:10.771 --> 29:13.191
I want you to stay.

29:13.274 --> 29:16.194
You know, this is
hard on me, too.

29:16.277 --> 29:18.571
I like Shelly.

29:19.238 --> 29:21.490
So why don't you watch some TV

29:21.574 --> 29:23.659
or put on a cassette
or something?

29:30.792 --> 29:32.753
Are you OK, Violet?

29:32.836 --> 29:36.089
Mick, why is Johnnie here?

29:36.173 --> 29:39.718
You know how I feel
about that psycho fuck.

29:40.302 --> 29:42.721
Caesar, didn't I tell you
to get something?

29:42.804 --> 29:46.099
Sure. Sorry, Mickey.

29:49.102 --> 29:51.605
You shouldn't have to see this.

29:51.688 --> 29:54.274
Why don't you get outta here?
Go for a walk.

29:54.358 --> 29:57.110
Caesar wants me to stay.

29:59.612 --> 30:01.989
Don't worry about Caesar.

30:02.073 --> 30:04.492
I'll handle Caesar.

30:05.076 --> 30:11.457
- You just get out of here. OK?
- OK. Thank you, Mickey.

30:12.708 --> 30:14.210
Here you go, Mick.

30:14.293 --> 30:16.003
Go all fucking night, Baby!

30:16.087 --> 30:18.464
All night!

30:24.512 --> 30:27.682
Hey, Johnnie, ease up, OK?

30:30.142 --> 30:31.311
Bitch!

30:34.398 --> 30:36.650
Pick him up.

30:44.908 --> 30:46.618
Shelly.

30:47.870 --> 30:49.830
I'm going to ask you 10 times.

30:49.913 --> 30:52.374
You understand?

30:52.457 --> 30:53.709
10 times.

31:09.933 --> 31:10.976
One.

31:11.059 --> 31:12.603
Where's our money?

31:12.686 --> 31:13.687
Aah, God!

31:34.541 --> 31:36.169
You all right?

31:49.224 --> 31:52.310
Come on. Let's get outta here.

31:55.855 --> 31:58.149
Keep it.

32:15.165 --> 32:18.126
Shelly was skimming
from the business.

32:18.210 --> 32:20.546
He came to see me yesterday

32:20.629 --> 32:23.549
because he was afraid
Caesar found out.

32:23.632 --> 32:26.468
He wanted to run, but he
wanted me to come with him.

32:26.552 --> 32:30.180
- Even though he knew about you.
- Yeah.

32:30.264 --> 32:32.641
What, this guy's
in love with you, right?

32:32.724 --> 32:35.853
That's what he tells himself,
but it's not even about me.

32:35.936 --> 32:37.896
You see, he could
have run at any time,

32:37.980 --> 32:39.983
but he didn't want out.

32:40.066 --> 32:41.693
Sounds like he wanted
to get caught.

32:41.776 --> 32:44.279
Yeah. Maybe he did.

32:44.362 --> 32:47.073
He would brag
to me all the time.

32:47.156 --> 32:50.493
He was never afraid
of Caesar because...

32:50.577 --> 32:52.120
he didn't know him.

32:52.203 --> 32:53.705
Not like I do.

32:55.456 --> 32:57.917
I used to be able
to block it out.

32:58.001 --> 33:00.461
I would just tell myself

33:00.545 --> 33:05.383
that I wasn't really
there, and so...

33:05.466 --> 33:08.553
none of it really mattered.

33:09.888 --> 33:12.348
But I can't do that any more.

33:14.350 --> 33:18.354
I'm making the same
mistake Shelly made,

33:18.438 --> 33:20.148
but now...

33:20.231 --> 33:22.609
I know what I want.

33:25.945 --> 33:28.531
I want out.

33:30.283 --> 33:32.869
I want a new life.

33:35.038 --> 33:38.208
I see what I've been waiting
for, but I can't do it alone.

33:45.216 --> 33:47.635
I need your help, Corky.

33:52.306 --> 33:54.808
Caesar's gonna get the money.
He's gonna bring it...

33:54.892 --> 33:55.851
How much money?

33:55.935 --> 33:58.062
Shelly said
it's over $2 million.

34:01.190 --> 34:03.025
Yeah.

34:03.108 --> 34:04.652
So Caesar's going to get it.

34:04.735 --> 34:06.111
He's going to bring it
by the apartment.

34:06.195 --> 34:07.446
He's going to count it.

34:07.530 --> 34:10.574
He'll go through the books and
figure out how Shelly did it.

34:10.658 --> 34:13.452
Violet, do you know
what you're saying?

34:13.536 --> 34:17.246
You're asking me
to help you fuck over the Mob.

34:17.330 --> 34:19.331
Violet, these people
are serious.

34:19.415 --> 34:22.293
You wanna know how serious,
you ask your friend Shelly.

34:22.377 --> 34:26.172
They are worse than cops because
they have money and no rules.

34:26.255 --> 34:28.091
You fuck them,
you'd better do it right.

34:28.174 --> 34:29.926
That's why I need your help.

34:30.009 --> 34:33.429
- You said you were good.
- I AM good.

34:35.931 --> 34:37.934
All right, let's just
say for a moment

34:38.016 --> 34:39.768
I believe everything
you're saying.

34:39.853 --> 34:43.106
- You think I'm lying?
- I didn't say that,

34:43.188 --> 34:46.943
but since you did,
let's say you are.

34:47.025 --> 34:49.697
It would have been easy
for you to set up Shelly.

34:49.780 --> 34:50.989
You could have had him killed

34:51.072 --> 34:55.953
knowing that Caesar would bring
the money back to the apartment.

34:56.036 --> 34:59.081
All you'd need to keep yourself
clean is someone unconnected:

34:59.665 --> 35:01.292
Someone like me.

35:03.210 --> 35:07.590
- Is that what you think?
- I'm just making a point.

35:09.842 --> 35:12.178
You have no idea
what you're asking,

35:12.261 --> 35:17.349
how much trust it takes 2 people
to do something like this.

35:20.936 --> 35:24.148
I mean, stealing's always
been a lot like sex.

35:24.231 --> 35:29.320
2 people who want the same
thing, they get in a room.

35:29.403 --> 35:30.821
They talk about it.

35:30.905 --> 35:34.533
They start to plan.
It's kind of like flirting.

35:34.617 --> 35:37.411
It's kind of like foreplay,

35:37.494 --> 35:41.832
because the more they talk
about it, the wetter they get.

35:44.126 --> 35:46.879
The only difference is,
I can fuck someone I just met,

35:48.464 --> 35:49.715
but to steal,

35:49.798 --> 35:52.343
I need to know someone
like I know myself.

35:52.426 --> 35:56.014
You think you know me like that?

35:57.849 --> 35:59.768
I want to see the money.

36:02.687 --> 36:06.942
- Oh, my God.
- Don't worry. It ain't mine.

36:15.325 --> 36:17.869
- Caesar, what happened?
- It was unbelievable, Vi.

36:17.953 --> 36:21.122
Un-fucking-believable.

36:21.206 --> 36:25.252
Shit. Look at this shirt.
Look at it. It's ruined.

36:25.335 --> 36:27.878
It all started when Shelly
took us to the money.

36:27.962 --> 36:30.589
I'll tell you something.
Mickey? He knows his shit.

36:30.673 --> 36:32.841
He does. Shelly
took us right there.

36:32.925 --> 36:35.386
So Shelly's down
on his knees, right?

36:35.469 --> 36:37.179
And he's pulling out
this money

36:37.263 --> 36:38.889
from the safe on the floor.

36:38.973 --> 36:40.558
And I'm there,
I'm standing there,

36:40.641 --> 36:43.060
and I'm looking at it, right?

36:43.143 --> 36:45.563
Like, "Holy fuck,"
and all I can think about

36:45.646 --> 36:48.941
is, "How the fuck
was he able to do this?"

36:49.024 --> 36:50.484
When... Bang!

36:50.568 --> 36:52.027
Johnnie caps him.

36:52.111 --> 36:53.988
He capped Shelly!

36:54.071 --> 36:55.489
Blood goes flying everywhere,

36:55.573 --> 36:56.949
all over me, all over the money.

36:57.032 --> 37:00.161
I have no idea if this
is even all of it.

37:02.080 --> 37:05.458
And right then, I go
through the roof, and... BAM!

37:05.542 --> 37:07.252
I punch the dumb son of a bitch.

37:07.335 --> 37:10.046
I punch him, Vi, right
in his dumb fucking face.

37:10.130 --> 37:11.840
I didn't give a shit
whose son he was.

37:11.923 --> 37:13.633
I just wanted to hit him again,

37:13.717 --> 37:16.511
smack some sense into
the dumb son of a bitch.

37:16.595 --> 37:19.681
Look at the shit that I
got to fucking deal with now.

37:19.764 --> 37:20.974
What'll you do with it?

37:21.057 --> 37:23.059
I told him to run it
through the cycles, but no.

37:23.143 --> 37:26.062
Johnnie calls up the old man,
and I guess he's got other plans

37:26.146 --> 37:29.649
because he wants to pick up
this shit tomorrow night.

37:33.778 --> 37:38.074
- Where's the laundry detergent?
- It's in the linen cabinet.

37:57.427 --> 38:01.598
Come to my place
in the morning... early.

38:02.934 --> 38:05.686
You think you
know me like that... like that...

38:08.773 --> 38:10.608
$2 million.

38:13.444 --> 38:15.321
You're having second thoughts.

38:15.404 --> 38:16.948
No.

38:17.031 --> 38:19.659
You said Caesar washed
the money?

38:19.742 --> 38:21.160
Yeah.

38:21.244 --> 38:23.162
Then what, exactly?

38:23.246 --> 38:26.040
- He hung it up.
- He what?

38:26.123 --> 38:28.543
To let it dry.

38:30.795 --> 38:32.588
It was unreal.

38:40.470 --> 38:43.723
Hundreds paper-clipped
everywhere like leaves.

38:51.147 --> 38:55.151
Then, one by one,
he ironed all of it.

39:01.575 --> 39:04.452
- Did he sleep?
- No, but neither did I.

39:09.500 --> 39:12.670
All night long,
I listened to that sound.

39:12.753 --> 39:15.965
- What sound?
- The sound of money.

39:21.679 --> 39:25.933
- Where is it now?
- It's in his office.

39:26.017 --> 39:28.811
I saw it this morning.

39:32.982 --> 39:35.776
I need to go to the store.

39:39.447 --> 39:42.158
It's in a case on his desk.

39:42.241 --> 39:43.826
Does the case lock?

39:43.910 --> 39:47.205
Yes.

39:48.748 --> 39:50.833
- Tell me about Johnnie.
- Johnnie?

39:50.917 --> 39:52.793
Yeah. Sounds like he and Caesar
don't like each other.

39:52.877 --> 39:54.754
Like each other?
They hate each other.

39:54.837 --> 39:56.923
- Why?
- I don't know.

39:57.006 --> 39:58.758
Happened long before
I came around.

39:58.841 --> 40:02.762
I think basically, Caesar thinks
Johnnie's a complete idiot,

40:02.845 --> 40:05.431
but, you know, what can you do?

40:05.515 --> 40:08.184
Johnnie runs Chicago
'cause Gino's his father.

40:08.267 --> 40:09.352
Who's Gino?

40:10.811 --> 40:12.731
Gino Marzzone.

40:13.899 --> 40:15.651
Marzzone.

40:15.734 --> 40:18.278
As in Angelo Marzzone,
head of the Marzzone family?

40:18.362 --> 40:20.405
Yeah. That's his brother.

40:22.241 --> 40:23.992
Shit.

40:24.076 --> 40:26.453
Gino Marzzone's coming
to your place tonight

40:26.537 --> 40:27.579
to pick up the money?

40:27.663 --> 40:29.373
Yeah.

40:29.456 --> 40:31.917
And Johnnie Marzzone's
his son. That's Johnnie?

40:32.000 --> 40:33.418
Yeah.

40:36.046 --> 40:38.131
Sweet Jesus.

40:44.637 --> 40:46.514
It's perfect.

40:46.597 --> 40:48.224
Gino Marzzone's coming
to your place tonight.

40:48.307 --> 40:49.433
This is the big deal.

40:49.517 --> 40:50.893
Caesar's gonna want
to do it right.

40:50.977 --> 40:52.353
He's not going to want
to look like an idiot.

40:52.436 --> 40:53.980
Has Gino ever been
to your place before?

40:54.063 --> 40:56.524
- Yeah, twice before.
- What happened?

40:56.607 --> 40:59.861
Well, Caesar was really nervous.
He kept cleaning the apartment.

40:59.944 --> 41:03.865
The first time, he picked out
the dress he wanted me to wear.

41:03.948 --> 41:07.326
- Did Johnnie ever hit on you?
- He hits on me all the time.

41:07.410 --> 41:09.287
He hits on anything
in high heels.

41:09.370 --> 41:10.788
Did Caesar ever see this?

41:10.872 --> 41:12.790
He does it right
in front of him.

41:12.874 --> 41:16.044
Oh, this is getting
better and better. Go on.

41:16.128 --> 41:18.922
Well, Gino doesn't
speak much English,

41:19.006 --> 41:20.132
or at least he pretends not to,

41:20.215 --> 41:22.217
so he usually gets
right to the point.

41:22.301 --> 41:25.220
Both times, they only
talked for about 5 minutes.

41:25.304 --> 41:27.222
They had a drink,
and then they left.

41:27.306 --> 41:28.557
What did Gino drink?

41:28.640 --> 41:30.767
Scotch. Glenlivet.

41:30.851 --> 41:34.563
I remember that because Caesar
made a big deal about it.

41:36.815 --> 41:39.067
All right.

41:45.866 --> 41:48.076
I've an idea how
to make this work.

41:49.077 --> 41:51.205
Go back and get ready.

41:51.288 --> 41:53.457
Take your time. Make it real.

41:53.540 --> 41:56.543
What time did you
say they'd be there?

41:56.627 --> 41:59.004
The plane gets in at 7:00, so...

41:59.087 --> 42:00.756
I'd say around 8:00.

42:00.839 --> 42:02.090
All right.

42:02.174 --> 42:04.593
Now, at some point,
Caesar's going to quit,

42:04.676 --> 42:06.678
I guess some time around 6:00,

42:06.762 --> 42:08.597
making sure he's got
time to get ready.

42:08.680 --> 42:11.850
As soon as he's done
you'll be right there

42:12.684 --> 42:13.560
to put a big drink
in his hand.

42:13.644 --> 42:17.105
Unbelievable
what this guy Shelly did.

42:17.189 --> 42:19.858
I'll tell you, Shelly's
one smart-ass motherfucker.

42:19.942 --> 42:23.947
I mean, he WAS one
smart-ass motherfucker.

42:24.030 --> 42:27.742
Poor boy has to work so hard.

42:32.038 --> 42:36.334
We want him to relax, unwind.

42:36.417 --> 42:39.128
You look good enough to eat.

42:40.547 --> 42:41.839
Where will you be?

42:41.923 --> 42:43.758
I'll be waiting
in the apartment next door.

42:43.841 --> 42:45.218
Waiting for what?

42:45.301 --> 42:50.431
For the shower.
That's gonna be our signal.

42:50.515 --> 42:54.810
When he's done with his shower,
you'll go to the bar.

42:54.893 --> 42:57.187
You'll get out the Scotch
that Gino drinks.

42:57.271 --> 43:01.692
As you do, the bottle will
slip from your hands:

43:01.775 --> 43:03.318
An accident.

43:05.654 --> 43:07.781
Vi, what the hell was that?

43:07.865 --> 43:10.367
Vi, you can't hear me?

43:10.450 --> 43:11.952
Oh, fuck!

43:12.035 --> 43:13.579
It slipped.
I was trying to get ready.

43:13.662 --> 43:15.497
How the fuck did you do that?

43:15.581 --> 43:18.000
Caesar, it was an accident.
I didn't mean to.

43:18.083 --> 43:20.961
- I'll get some more.
- There's no fucking time!

43:21.044 --> 43:23.297
Don't be silly.
There's lots of time.

43:23.380 --> 43:25.008
I'll clean this up,
and I'll be back

43:25.091 --> 43:27.635
- before you're even dressed.
- Ah, fuck, Vi!

43:34.267 --> 43:37.562
When you open
the door, I'll be there.

43:41.441 --> 43:45.195
- What if he sees you?
- He won't.

43:45.278 --> 43:49.324
You can't know for certain
that he won't see you.

43:49.407 --> 43:53.411
- Trust me.
- I'm just asking, what if?

43:53.494 --> 43:55.622
If he does...

43:56.789 --> 43:59.834
then I won't have
a choice, will I?

44:02.295 --> 44:05.715
When I'm inside,
I'll get the money.

44:46.924 --> 44:49.426
I'm going to need something
to fill the case.

44:49.510 --> 44:51.720
Hide it near the desk.

44:51.804 --> 44:53.889
And at that point...

44:56.892 --> 45:00.062
There's no turning back.

45:10.822 --> 45:13.658
When I get the Scotch,

45:13.741 --> 45:15.869
how do I know you
wonâ€™t just take off?

45:15.952 --> 45:21.416
The same way I'll know that
you got the Scotch: Trust.

45:21.499 --> 45:23.710
I still don't see
how I'll get away clean

45:23.793 --> 45:25.670
with all the money
in the apartment.

45:25.753 --> 45:27.839
Everyone's gonna think
I took it.

45:27.922 --> 45:29.299
- Not Caesar.
- Why?

45:29.382 --> 45:31.593
Because of what
you're gonna tell him.

45:31.676 --> 45:33.803
You gotta be
as real as you can.

45:33.888 --> 45:37.683
When you walk through that door
with the Scotch in your hand,

45:37.766 --> 45:39.768
you'll be covered.

45:39.852 --> 45:43.272
That moment's the most important
moment of the plan.

45:43.355 --> 45:46.358
If you're real enough,
he's gonna believe you

45:46.442 --> 45:48.319
'cause deep down, he'll want to.

45:48.402 --> 45:49.737
Cea!

45:49.820 --> 45:52.948
Shit. I'm sorry.
They were early.

45:53.032 --> 45:55.951
- What are you talking about?
- They just left, didn't they?

45:56.035 --> 45:58.871
- What are you, drunk?
- They werenâ€™t just up here?

45:58.954 --> 46:03.250
- No. They're on their way.
- That doesn't make any sense.

46:03.334 --> 46:05.502
Why?

46:05.586 --> 46:08.005
Well, I just saw
Johnnie downstairs.

46:11.342 --> 46:12.843
- What?
- Yeah.

46:12.927 --> 46:15.429
I got out of my car
and saw him in his BMW.

46:17.473 --> 46:19.433
Nah, it couldn't have been.

46:19.517 --> 46:22.978
It was him, Caesar.
I'm positive.

46:23.437 --> 46:27.650
- Vi, that's impossible.
- Caesar, I know Johnnie.

46:27.733 --> 46:29.318
It was him.

46:29.401 --> 46:31.946
I screamed when I saw him. I
couldn't believe I missed them.

46:32.029 --> 46:33.447
I knew you were
going to be upset,

46:33.531 --> 46:36.951
so I thought I'd apologise
and give Gino the Scotch.

46:37.034 --> 46:41.039
I honked a few times, but he
didn't hear me and didn't stop.

46:44.125 --> 46:46.586
But...

46:46.670 --> 46:49.965
Gino's plane doesn't get here
for another half-hour.

46:53.176 --> 46:55.303
Actually, I didn't
see Gino in the car.

47:06.815 --> 47:09.359
If Caesar hates
Johnnie as much as you say,

47:09.442 --> 47:10.860
the second he opens the case,

47:10.943 --> 47:14.738
he's gonna know in his gut
that Johnnie just fucked him.

47:14.822 --> 47:15.906
He'll have no choice.

47:15.990 --> 47:18.492
He can't go after
Gino or Johnnie.

47:18.576 --> 47:22.788
There's only one way out.
He'll have to run.

47:24.665 --> 47:29.378
And if he runs, everyone
will assume he took the money.

47:29.461 --> 47:32.381
You'll be clean,
and we'll be rich.

47:32.464 --> 47:36.218
Jesus, that's beautiful.

47:36.302 --> 47:40.181
If you're this goddamn smart,
how did you ever get caught?

47:40.264 --> 47:43.435
I had a partner once.

47:43.518 --> 47:45.812
She fucked me.

47:47.022 --> 47:53.778
- I won't.
- I think we're gonna find out.

47:58.491 --> 48:00.493
- Oh, God...
- Caesar?

48:06.499 --> 48:07.500
Cea?

48:09.252 --> 48:11.671
Oh, no. Oh!

48:11.796 --> 48:13.465
Oh, God.

48:17.344 --> 48:19.846
Vi...

48:19.930 --> 48:23.183
- Vi, I've been set up.
- Johnnie?

48:23.266 --> 48:25.602
That fuck.

48:25.685 --> 48:28.438
That rat fuck!

48:28.522 --> 48:31.066
That motherless rat fuck!

48:31.149 --> 48:34.528
Why? Why would Johnnie do this?

48:38.448 --> 48:42.327
Jesus Christ, Violet,
open your fucking eyes.

48:42.410 --> 48:46.122
Johnnie hates me
as much as I hate him.

48:46.206 --> 48:47.917
I hate that motherless
rat fucker. I hate him.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.835
I fucking hate him. I hate him.

48:49.919 --> 48:53.589
- But you know he did it.
- Yeah, so what?

48:53.673 --> 48:55.883
Violet, so fucking what?

48:55.967 --> 48:59.971
Look, the money is gone, right?

49:00.054 --> 49:01.722
Gino's coming to get it.

49:01.806 --> 49:04.225
Now, do you think Gino
is going to believe me

49:04.308 --> 49:06.769
when I tell him his
little rat-fuck son stole it?

49:06.853 --> 49:09.438
Is that what you think?
Because I don't.

49:09.522 --> 49:10.815
You know what I think?

49:10.898 --> 49:12.316
I think I'm a dead man.

49:12.400 --> 49:16.153
I'm one in the back of the head.
That's what I think.

49:17.446 --> 49:18.823
Caesar, what are we going to do?

49:18.906 --> 49:21.533
Well, I know what Johnnie
wants me to do.

49:21.616 --> 49:24.494
Johnnie wants me to run.
He wants me out of here.

49:24.578 --> 49:27.581
But if I run, then everybody
thinks I fucking did it,

49:27.664 --> 49:30.750
and he gets away
with 2 million clean.

49:31.835 --> 49:34.129
I can see him right now,

49:34.212 --> 49:36.423
on the way to get Gino,
laughing at me.

49:36.506 --> 49:37.716
Laughing at me. Laughing at me!

49:37.799 --> 49:39.968
Laughing at me! Laughing at me!

49:40.051 --> 49:42.971
Fucking laughing at me!

49:43.346 --> 49:45.640
- Cea, Cea...
- Don't, Violet, please.

49:45.724 --> 49:46.975
Don't touch me, OK?

49:47.058 --> 49:50.020
I gotta think. I gotta
fucking think this through!

49:50.103 --> 49:52.607
- Caesar...
- No. No, Vi.

49:52.690 --> 49:54.734
I think we should run.
We should go.

49:54.817 --> 49:56.444
We have to go now
before it's too late.

49:56.527 --> 49:59.071
No, please, Violet,
leave me alone!

49:59.155 --> 50:01.032
Please! All right?

50:01.115 --> 50:04.827
Just leave me the fuck alone!

50:06.787 --> 50:08.998
All right, Caesar.

50:10.041 --> 50:12.084
I- I-I just, I got
to think. That's all.

50:12.168 --> 50:14.795
I-I-I just got to think.

50:38.236 --> 50:40.363
- It's me.
- What happened?

50:40.446 --> 50:43.741
He totally freaked out.
I've never seen him like this.

50:43.824 --> 50:45.451
He's out of his fucking mind.

50:45.535 --> 50:48.204
All right, as long
as he believes it was Johnnie.

50:48.287 --> 50:53.000
Believes it? Jesus.
It's driving him crazy.

50:53.084 --> 50:55.503
He wants to kill him.

50:55.586 --> 50:57.422
I don't know, Corky.
I don't know.

50:57.506 --> 50:59.675
I'm getting nervous.
I'm getting really nervous.

50:59.758 --> 51:01.218
I don't know
what he's gonna do.

51:01.301 --> 51:03.846
It's all right, Violet.
It's working.

51:03.929 --> 51:07.015
All we gotta do is wait him out
and see what he does.

51:07.099 --> 51:10.018
What if he doesn't run?

51:10.102 --> 51:11.937
That means he'll
probably kill Johnnie.

51:12.020 --> 51:14.690
Oh, Christ.
I have to get out of here.

51:14.773 --> 51:15.941
Listen.

51:16.024 --> 51:19.361
If he doesn't run,
all you gotta do is break down.

51:19.444 --> 51:22.281
Go into the bedroom
and pack some things.

51:22.364 --> 51:24.950
Start crying. Tell him you
love him, but you can't take it.

51:25.033 --> 51:28.870
You're sorry, but you
gotta leave. Just walk out.

51:28.953 --> 51:30.788
All right. OK.

51:30.872 --> 51:33.124
We're almost there.
Just hang on.

51:34.250 --> 51:36.043
He's coming.

51:37.837 --> 51:39.839
I got it.
I know what I have to do.

51:39.922 --> 51:44.177
- I have to get the money back.
- The money? The money's gone.

51:44.260 --> 51:47.555
No, no, no. Johnnie's got it.
I gotta get it back.

51:47.638 --> 51:49.056
But it could be anywhere.

51:49.140 --> 51:51.559
There's not enough time,
Violet.

51:51.642 --> 51:54.187
Johnnie's picking up
Gino at the airport, right?

51:54.270 --> 51:55.980
That means he's
probably got the money with him.

51:56.063 --> 51:58.232
He's probably got it in the car.

51:58.316 --> 51:59.775
He didn't see you, did he?

51:59.859 --> 52:03.989
- No.
- Good.

52:04.072 --> 52:06.241
That's good.

52:08.952 --> 52:10.996
So that means I got the edge.

52:11.079 --> 52:13.749
He doesn't know I know.

52:16.335 --> 52:19.755
That's why he put
the paper in the case.

52:19.838 --> 52:23.550
He wants me to hand it to Gino.

52:23.634 --> 52:27.304
Then there's no doubt I did it.

52:27.387 --> 52:30.307
Gino will put a bullet
in me himself.

52:31.934 --> 52:34.520
But that's not gonna happen.

52:37.689 --> 52:40.943
That jackoff's not gonna set
me up. No way, not like this.

52:42.528 --> 52:44.780
This is insane.

52:49.159 --> 52:51.912
What are you doing?

52:51.995 --> 52:54.873
I'm leaving. I don't want
any part of this shit.

52:54.957 --> 52:56.959
I don't wanna be involved.

52:57.042 --> 52:59.253
- You can't leave.
- The hell I can't.

53:01.171 --> 53:03.006
I need you.

53:03.090 --> 53:06.886
You don't need me.
You've never needed me.

53:06.970 --> 53:08.972
I can't help you. Understand?

53:17.730 --> 53:20.859
I can't let you leave, Violet.

53:20.942 --> 53:23.945
If you're not with me
I assume you're against me.

53:25.113 --> 53:27.824
Caesar, this is crazy.

53:27.907 --> 53:32.453
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

53:32.537 --> 53:34.747
Maybe you dropped that bottle
of Scotch by accident.

53:34.831 --> 53:36.249
Maybe you didn't.

53:36.332 --> 53:39.042
It would have been so easy

53:39.126 --> 53:42.629
to let him in as you left.

53:44.339 --> 53:45.549
You can't believe that.

53:45.632 --> 53:48.635
I've seen the way
he looks at you.

53:48.719 --> 53:50.971
He's always wanted you.

53:51.847 --> 53:54.141
Maybe 2 million bucks
finally bought you.

54:03.358 --> 54:05.986
I'm sorry, Violet.

54:09.031 --> 54:11.117
I want to trust you.

54:11.951 --> 54:14.329
I hope you understand.

54:21.502 --> 54:23.755
I don't have any other choice.

54:41.648 --> 54:43.858
You sure you don't want a drink?

55:09.175 --> 55:10.843
Hello?

55:10.927 --> 55:12.595
- Yeah, we're here.
- Hey, Johnnie.

55:12.679 --> 55:15.850
- Open the fucking door.
- Sure. Come on up.

55:52.343 --> 55:54.470
Gino.

55:56.097 --> 55:59.559
Good to see you.
Vi, look who's here.

55:59.642 --> 56:02.979
- Hello, Gino. How are you?
- Che bella.

56:07.775 --> 56:11.529
- You shouldn't have hit me.
- You wanna get into this now?

56:11.613 --> 56:15.533
No, Caesar, not now. Hah! Ha ha!

56:22.458 --> 56:25.336
You are as radiant
as ever, Violet.

56:40.643 --> 56:44.355
Gino, Glenlivet, right?

56:45.022 --> 56:47.233
And I'll have whatever
Violet's drinking.

56:47.316 --> 56:50.110
- I'm not drinking.
- Well, neither will I.

56:52.238 --> 56:54.532
No, I'll have
a Tanqueray and tonic.

56:54.615 --> 56:58.452
Mmm. Caesar, 2 T-and-Ts.

57:16.720 --> 57:21.600
Salute, huh?
Roy, Pop, Violet, Caesar.

57:24.229 --> 57:25.730
No, no, son.
No, Johnnie, no.

57:25.814 --> 57:29.776
- I gotta make a bet.
- No goddamn phone. Not now.

57:29.860 --> 57:33.238
Cesare, come and sit.
We're going to talk now.

57:33.321 --> 57:36.575
Johnnie, you, too. No, no, no.

57:39.494 --> 57:42.122
Cesare, look at me.

57:42.664 --> 57:45.750
Johnnie said to me
what happened.

57:46.835 --> 57:49.462
Cesare, you got to
do me a favour.

57:49.546 --> 57:52.549
A personal favour for me, huh?

57:52.632 --> 57:57.386
You got to start respecting
Johnnie the way you respect me.

57:58.304 --> 58:01.473
Capisce? Good. Good.

58:02.641 --> 58:07.605
And you, Johnnie, you got
to stop acting stupid.

58:07.688 --> 58:11.233
You gotta earn this respect
that Cesare's gonna give.

58:11.317 --> 58:13.611
Capisce?

58:14.778 --> 58:17.448
Good. Done.

58:19.992 --> 58:21.619
Now...

58:23.412 --> 58:25.331
Where is my money?

58:34.382 --> 58:36.843
We know how this was done, eh?

58:38.929 --> 58:41.556
Yeah. I know.

58:41.640 --> 58:45.060
- And it won't happen again, eh?
- No.

58:45.143 --> 58:47.979
Good. Done. We go now.

58:48.063 --> 58:49.731
Wait a minute, Pop.
Jesus Christ.

58:49.814 --> 58:53.068
You got 2 hours
till your plane leaves.

58:53.151 --> 58:55.070
Che minchia stai facendo?

58:55.153 --> 58:56.696
So just relax. Have a drink.

58:56.780 --> 58:59.824
Stronzo.
Cesare, ancora del Glenlivet.

59:07.582 --> 59:11.920
So, Caesar, tell me something.
What did it total out at?

59:12.921 --> 59:16.800
- 2.176.
- Unbelievable.

59:17.926 --> 59:20.554
- Can you believe that, Violet?
- Johnnie...

59:20.637 --> 59:23.557
Come on. I just want
to know one thing.

59:23.640 --> 59:28.520
Just one thing after he made
such a big deal about it.

59:28.603 --> 59:30.981
I bet it wasn't such
a big deal, huh, Caesar?

59:33.067 --> 59:37.530
- What's that, Johnnie?
- The money.

59:37.613 --> 59:39.532
I bet it wasn't nothing
to make it clean

59:39.615 --> 59:41.993
after you made such a
big fucking deal about it.

59:42.076 --> 59:43.244
What did I tell you?

59:43.327 --> 59:44.996
It's important to me.
It's a simple question.

59:45.079 --> 59:48.708
If he'd just answer,
that's the end of it.

59:52.336 --> 59:53.588
Where's this going, Johnnie?

59:53.671 --> 59:56.841
Just admit it.

59:59.802 --> 01:00:03.472
- Admit what?
- That you overreacted.

01:00:03.556 --> 01:00:06.600
YOU lost it. Not me.

01:00:09.144 --> 01:00:10.729
It was YOUR mistake.

01:00:10.812 --> 01:00:14.149
You want to play it this way?

01:00:14.232 --> 01:00:16.193
I can play it this way.

01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:20.530
You want to know
who made a mistake?

01:00:22.407 --> 01:00:23.783
Open the case.

01:00:23.867 --> 01:00:25.827
- Caesar...
- Shut up, Violet.

01:00:25.911 --> 01:00:27.746
This is between me and Johnnie.

01:00:31.124 --> 01:00:32.792
You want to do this now?

01:00:35.128 --> 01:00:37.215
Let's do it.

01:00:40.259 --> 01:00:42.553
Open the fucking case.

01:00:47.934 --> 01:00:50.811
Open the case.

01:00:59.529 --> 01:01:02.406
- Where's the fucking key?
- You don't need a key.

01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:04.617
Then how the fuck
can I open it?

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:10.873
- The same way you did before.
- What are you talking about?

01:01:13.376 --> 01:01:15.253
All right, Johnnie.

01:01:21.217 --> 01:01:23.427
Violet?

01:01:23.511 --> 01:01:26.055
Get me another drink.

01:01:43.657 --> 01:01:44.700
What is this?

01:01:44.783 --> 01:01:47.411
Don't. Don't you fucking move.

01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:50.998
- Where is it, fuckface?
- Where's what?

01:01:51.081 --> 01:01:53.375
The money!

01:01:53.458 --> 01:01:55.460
OK, Caesar, I don't know
what you're thinking here,

01:01:55.544 --> 01:01:57.629
- if you don't put the gun...
- Sit down.

01:02:00.048 --> 01:02:01.800
Caesar, what is it?

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:04.511
Gino, your son stole
this money to set me up.

01:02:04.595 --> 01:02:07.514
He fucking stole it,
and I can prove it.

01:02:07.598 --> 01:02:10.434
Violet, tell them. Tell them!

01:02:12.144 --> 01:02:14.437
For God's sake, Johnnie,
do what he says.

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.189
For Christ's sake...

01:02:16.272 --> 01:02:18.274
This isn't happening.

01:02:19.358 --> 01:02:20.985
Son of a...

01:02:21.068 --> 01:02:23.029
The next one blows off
your fucking dick.

01:02:23.112 --> 01:02:26.866
I'm looking at a dead man.
You're a fucking dead man.

01:02:26.949 --> 01:02:28.201
Enough!

01:02:28.284 --> 01:02:30.161
- Basta!
- Gino, don't.

01:02:30.244 --> 01:02:32.163
You point the gun at me?

01:02:33.748 --> 01:02:37.668
You know who I am?
I'm Gino Marzzoni, capisce?

01:02:38.878 --> 01:02:41.172
Non essere stupido.
Dammi la pistola.

01:02:41.255 --> 01:02:45.092
- No, Gino, please.
- Dammi la pistola.

01:02:45.176 --> 01:02:47.763
Gino, sit down.

01:02:47.846 --> 01:02:51.058
We're... we're family, Cesare.

01:02:51.141 --> 01:02:54.394
Your family, Caesar.

01:02:54.478 --> 01:02:56.688
Family.

01:02:57.147 --> 01:02:58.732
Now...

01:03:00.275 --> 01:03:02.152
Give it to me.

01:03:12.287 --> 01:03:13.372
Good man.

01:03:49.992 --> 01:03:51.202
Don't shoot.

01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:20.106
I had to do it, Violet.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:22.317
You saw it.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.692
I had no choice.

01:04:23.775 --> 01:04:27.112
It was Johnnie.

01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:28.989
Lying rat-fuck.

01:04:29.072 --> 01:04:31.658
He made me do it.

01:04:34.661 --> 01:04:38.332
You stupid fuck! You think
you could set me up, huh?

01:04:43.629 --> 01:04:45.088
I'm a dead man, Johnnie?

01:04:45.172 --> 01:04:47.049
I'm a fucking dead man?

01:04:47.132 --> 01:04:49.760
Guess again, Johnnie.
Who's the dead man? Who?

01:04:49.843 --> 01:04:52.638
Who's dead, fuckface? Who?

01:04:52.721 --> 01:04:55.183
Who? I can't hear you, Johnnie.

01:04:55.266 --> 01:04:58.311
Guess again.
Take another guess, Johnnie.

01:04:58.394 --> 01:05:00.271
Take another fucking guess.

01:05:12.116 --> 01:05:13.618
What are you doing?

01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:25.547
Maybe 3 hours.

01:05:27.006 --> 01:05:29.092
Caesar, what are you
going to do?

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:32.262
What do you think? We're
going to get the money back.

01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:35.849
- What?
- If we get the money back

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.517
then none of this ever happened.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.646
Caesar, you just killed
Gino Marzzone.

01:05:41.729 --> 01:05:44.148
No, I didn't.

01:05:44.232 --> 01:05:45.692
Not if the bodies disappear,

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:47.110
not if the money's here.

01:05:47.193 --> 01:05:48.486
Then they never showed up.

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:51.197
What happened to them?

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:54.909
I don't know.
Maybe we'll never know.

01:05:58.246 --> 01:06:00.833
My guess? It was a job.

01:06:00.916 --> 01:06:03.335
Maybe the Carpellas.

01:06:03.419 --> 01:06:05.588
All part of the business.

01:06:05.671 --> 01:06:06.881
Look. Once we find the money,

01:06:06.964 --> 01:06:09.216
then everything's
gonna be all right.

01:06:15.055 --> 01:06:17.224
Somebody's called them.

01:06:21.187 --> 01:06:23.939
- Fuck!
- Oh, no.

01:06:24.023 --> 01:06:26.483
Fuck.

01:06:27.067 --> 01:06:29.945
Caesar, what are we gonna do?

01:06:30.029 --> 01:06:33.740
They're just cops.
Stall them as long as you can.

01:06:51.966 --> 01:06:54.928
Gino, man...

01:06:58.056 --> 01:07:00.850
Come on.

01:07:12.154 --> 01:07:13.697
Answer it.

01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:23.749
- Hello?
- This is the police, ma'am.

01:07:23.832 --> 01:07:27.836
- The police?
- We had a report of gunfire.

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:31.840
- Gunfire? Is this a joke?
- No joke, ma'am.

01:07:49.567 --> 01:07:51.068
Please open the door.

01:07:51.151 --> 01:07:56.115
Um... How do I know that
you're really the police?

01:07:59.577 --> 01:08:02.121
Ma'am, you have
to open the door.

01:08:03.581 --> 01:08:05.624
All right.

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:52.649
Now, if you're thinking
about doing something stupid,

01:09:52.732 --> 01:09:57.988
remember... I just
killed Gino Marzzone.

01:09:58.071 --> 01:10:01.074
You understand what that means?

01:10:01.658 --> 01:10:04.411
They're just cops.

01:10:16.298 --> 01:10:19.427
See? We're for real.

01:10:20.678 --> 01:10:24.390
I'm sorry. It's just that
sometimes you hear stories.

01:10:24.473 --> 01:10:25.850
You did the right thing.

01:10:35.067 --> 01:10:37.111
Come on in.

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:43.659
Hey, hey. Chicago's finest.

01:10:43.743 --> 01:10:47.371
- How's it going tonight?
- Pretty good, sir.

01:10:47.455 --> 01:10:51.291
I'm sorry. Got a bum ear.
Can't hear shit with it.

01:10:51.374 --> 01:10:54.002
My name is Caesar,
and this here's my Violet.

01:10:57.172 --> 01:11:01.468
So Violet tells me there's
some problems about gunshots?

01:11:01.551 --> 01:11:04.679
Yes, sir. A neighbour
in the building called in.

01:11:04.763 --> 01:11:08.225
- I think we know what happened.
- Probably just the television.

01:11:08.308 --> 01:11:11.561
Oh, the television.

01:11:11.645 --> 01:11:14.940
Honey, why don't you
turn it off?

01:11:17.067 --> 01:11:18.527
This happened before.

01:11:18.610 --> 01:11:20.320
This ear, I was born with it.

01:11:20.403 --> 01:11:24.408
Today, the batteries went dead
on my hearing aid. I'm sorry.

01:11:24.492 --> 01:11:26.369
- It's all right, sir.
- No big deal.

01:11:26.452 --> 01:11:29.747
I hate to trouble you guys. Can
I get you a beer or something?

01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:32.500
No, not on duty. Sorry.

01:11:32.583 --> 01:11:36.212
But, uh, you mind
if I use your bathroom?

01:11:38.839 --> 01:11:41.217
No. Sure. It's right over here.

01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.177
Thanks.

01:11:43.261 --> 01:11:46.097
Listen, you mind
if I make myself a drink?

01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:49.475
- Yeah, right there.
- Sure, go right ahead, sir.

01:12:15.585 --> 01:12:19.505
- This is a beautiful place.
- Thank you.

01:12:30.934 --> 01:12:33.604
Is this a condo?

01:12:39.526 --> 01:12:42.029
OK, let's roll.

01:12:44.948 --> 01:12:48.660
Oh, try to keep extra batteries
around for the aid, OK?

01:12:48.744 --> 01:12:50.162
Good idea.

01:12:54.458 --> 01:12:56.960
Come on, let's go.

01:13:03.925 --> 01:13:06.052
Shit.

01:13:21.984 --> 01:13:25.279
Fuck! Where is it? Where is it?

01:13:26.822 --> 01:13:28.407
Think.

01:13:29.992 --> 01:13:32.496
It's got to be at his place.

01:13:33.664 --> 01:13:35.332
Get in the car.

01:13:35.415 --> 01:13:38.627
- Caesar, I don't think...
- Get in the fucking car.

01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:05.863
$2 million, Corky.

01:14:07.447 --> 01:14:09.741
$2 million.

01:14:09.825 --> 01:14:12.327
It's gotta be here.
It's gotta be.

01:14:12.411 --> 01:14:14.162
I just... I got to think.

01:14:14.246 --> 01:14:15.956
Think like Johnnie.

01:14:16.039 --> 01:14:19.585
OK, I'm Johnnie.

01:14:24.172 --> 01:14:26.216
I come in...

01:14:27.843 --> 01:14:29.511
Where did I put it?

01:14:31.096 --> 01:14:33.682
It's a lot of fucking money,

01:14:33.765 --> 01:14:35.184
and I got to hide it.

01:14:35.268 --> 01:14:38.521
I got to hide it.
I don't have much time.

01:14:38.605 --> 01:14:42.859
I got to get to the airport,
pick up my fucking daddy!

01:14:49.657 --> 01:14:53.828
"I can't wait to see Caesar's
face when he finds out. "

01:15:03.838 --> 01:15:06.633
- Where did he put it?
- Cea...

01:15:10.969 --> 01:15:13.138
Think. Think.

01:15:20.979 --> 01:15:23.607
Where is it, you motherfucker?!

01:15:23.690 --> 01:15:25.567
Where? Where?

01:15:43.586 --> 01:15:45.713
Cea?

01:15:47.674 --> 01:15:49.342
Cea.

01:15:56.558 --> 01:15:59.143
It's not here, Caesar.

01:16:03.189 --> 01:16:06.526
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

01:16:06.609 --> 01:16:09.404
It could be anywhere.

01:16:09.487 --> 01:16:11.948
We don't even know
if he was alone, Caesar.

01:16:12.031 --> 01:16:15.201
Come on. We have to
get out of here.

01:16:15.285 --> 01:16:17.745
We don't have much time.

01:16:24.335 --> 01:16:26.296
What are you doing?

01:16:37.765 --> 01:16:41.769
Got to buy more time.
More time.

01:16:41.853 --> 01:16:44.398
Who are you going to call?

01:16:53.616 --> 01:16:55.367
- Yeah?
- Hey, Mickey?

01:16:55.451 --> 01:16:56.911
Oh, God.

01:16:56.994 --> 01:17:00.497
Caesar,
what the fuck time is it?

01:17:00.581 --> 01:17:02.082
Oh, Mickey, I wake you up?

01:17:02.166 --> 01:17:04.043
Listen, I'm sorry.
I know it's late.

01:17:04.126 --> 01:17:06.253
Look, I don't know
if this is a big deal,

01:17:06.337 --> 01:17:10.090
- but they ain't showed up yet.
- What? They ain't there?

01:17:10.174 --> 01:17:13.761
No. I called the airport.
The plane landed on time.

01:17:13.844 --> 01:17:17.764
I even called over at Johnnie's
house, but there's no answer.

01:17:17.847 --> 01:17:21.476
OK. Let me call around.
I'll see what I can do.

01:17:21.559 --> 01:17:24.771
- Don't go anywhere, OK?
- OK, sure.

01:17:24.854 --> 01:17:28.149
Caesar,
you still have the money?

01:17:28.233 --> 01:17:30.026
Oh, yeah, Mickey.
I still got the money.

01:17:30.109 --> 01:17:32.820
Staring right at it.

01:17:32.904 --> 01:17:36.449
Good. Sit tight. I'll call you.

01:17:36.533 --> 01:17:39.035
Bye.

01:17:51.382 --> 01:17:53.717
I'll start packing.
You know what you have to do.

01:17:53.801 --> 01:17:57.721
I'll use Johnnie's car
to dump the bodies in the lake.

01:17:57.805 --> 01:18:01.392
I need plastic bags
and rope and tape.

01:18:01.475 --> 01:18:03.519
Just hurry.

01:18:17.074 --> 01:18:18.868
Please, Corky, please.

01:18:23.664 --> 01:18:26.500
- Oh, thank God.
- I'm still here.

01:18:26.584 --> 01:18:28.752
I was so afraid
you were going to leave me.

01:18:28.836 --> 01:18:32.298
You don't quit on me, Violet,
I won't quit on you.

01:18:38.846 --> 01:18:41.932
Corky, it worked.
He's going to run.

01:18:42.016 --> 01:18:44.518
He needs to take care of the
bodies to buy himself time,

01:18:44.602 --> 01:18:47.354
but as soon
as he leaves it's over.

01:18:47.438 --> 01:18:50.608
Just a little while longer.

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.570
Corky...

01:18:56.823 --> 01:18:58.909
I want to tell you something.

01:18:58.992 --> 01:19:01.995
I know, Violet.

01:19:04.581 --> 01:19:06.666
I know.

01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:11.671
It's why I'm still here.

01:19:29.230 --> 01:19:30.856
Who was that?

01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:33.484
Vi, who the fuck was that?

01:19:35.986 --> 01:19:38.822
Did you call Mickey?

01:19:38.906 --> 01:19:41.075
Did you?!

01:20:00.554 --> 01:20:03.682
Mickey? That you?

01:20:03.765 --> 01:20:06.059
Fuck.

01:20:30.250 --> 01:20:32.502
Who is that? Who's over there?

01:20:32.586 --> 01:20:34.629
Who's over there? Tell me!

01:20:34.713 --> 01:20:37.465
- Tell me!
- No! God!

01:20:37.549 --> 01:20:40.135
No! Please don't!
Please don't!

01:20:45.891 --> 01:20:49.186
No! No! No, Caesar!

01:21:35.273 --> 01:21:37.776
Drop the fucking gun or die.

01:21:38.902 --> 01:21:40.946
Drop it!

01:21:41.029 --> 01:21:42.155
Turn around.

01:21:47.077 --> 01:21:49.162
You?

01:21:51.122 --> 01:21:53.083
Holy fucking Christ.

01:21:58.004 --> 01:21:59.923
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:22:06.638 --> 01:22:09.141
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:22:10.476 --> 01:22:14.480
Hey. Come on.

01:22:14.564 --> 01:22:15.857
Wake up. Wake up.

01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:18.192
Wake up.

01:22:20.695 --> 01:22:24.907
Wake up, you fucking dyke.

01:22:26.367 --> 01:22:28.035
Good.

01:22:29.287 --> 01:22:31.038
I know everything now.

01:22:31.122 --> 01:22:35.209
I don't wanna hear
any I-don't-know bullshit.

01:22:36.878 --> 01:22:38.838
God.

01:22:38.921 --> 01:22:42.174
I should have seen this coming
the minute I met you.

01:22:42.258 --> 01:22:46.637
Everybody knows your
kind can't be trusted.

01:22:46.721 --> 01:22:49.307
Fucking queers.
You make me sick.

01:22:53.644 --> 01:22:55.980
But you made a fatal mistake.

01:22:56.063 --> 01:23:01.110
You tried to fuck the wrong guy,
and I swear to you,

01:23:01.194 --> 01:23:03.487
I'm gonna kill you for it.

01:23:04.572 --> 01:23:06.073
Where's my money?

01:23:06.157 --> 01:23:07.950
- Don't tell him.
- Shut up, Violet.

01:23:08.034 --> 01:23:10.119
- He can't kill you.
- Violet!

01:23:10.203 --> 01:23:12.206
Not till he has the money.

01:23:18.837 --> 01:23:22.174
Now. Where is it?

01:23:22.257 --> 01:23:23.884
Lick me.

01:23:23.967 --> 01:23:25.344
Where...

01:23:25.427 --> 01:23:26.386
is...

01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:27.846
my... money?

01:23:29.223 --> 01:23:33.101
Either pull the trigger or
get that thing out of my face.

01:23:33.185 --> 01:23:35.145
Fucking cunt.

01:23:35.229 --> 01:23:37.898
Caesar, stop acting
like an asshole and think.

01:23:37.981 --> 01:23:40.484
Violet, don't try to
tell me what to do.

01:23:40.567 --> 01:23:43.402
You need the money
just like we do.

01:23:43.486 --> 01:23:45.363
Why don't you let us go?
We'll make a deal.

01:23:45.446 --> 01:23:48.449
Shut the fuck up!

01:23:49.242 --> 01:23:50.535
What? What? What?

01:23:50.618 --> 01:23:54.497
What did you do to her, huh?
What did you fucking do to her?

01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:56.958
That's not MY Violet.

01:23:58.751 --> 01:24:02.588
- What did she do to you?
- Everything you couldn't.

01:24:08.594 --> 01:24:12.807
You ungrateful fucking bitch!

01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:16.061
Vi, you were nothing
before you met me!

01:24:16.144 --> 01:24:18.438
Don't you remember
you had nothing?

01:24:18.522 --> 01:24:22.526
Who gave you this place, huh?

01:24:22.609 --> 01:24:24.528
Who gave it to you?

01:24:24.611 --> 01:24:27.573
I did, Vi. I did.

01:24:27.656 --> 01:24:30.784
You were nothing.
You had nothing.

01:24:30.868 --> 01:24:32.828
What a load of crap.

01:24:32.911 --> 01:24:35.122
Take a look at yourself, Caesar.

01:24:35.205 --> 01:24:37.124
You're nothing
but a common thug.

01:24:37.207 --> 01:24:38.876
You launder money for the Mob.

01:24:38.959 --> 01:24:40.919
You rent women
like you rented this apartment.

01:24:41.003 --> 01:24:45.257
You used me, Caesar.
Just like I used you.

01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:47.926
All part of the business.

01:24:48.010 --> 01:24:50.512
You betrayed me.

01:24:50.596 --> 01:24:52.306
You murdered Gino!

01:24:52.389 --> 01:24:55.767
Yeah. Sure. You made me.
I had to do that.

01:24:55.851 --> 01:24:58.437
Bullshit. You did it.

01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:01.106
Because you couldn't stand the
thought of Johnnie fucking you.

01:25:01.190 --> 01:25:02.316
- Shut up.
- YOU shut up.

01:25:02.399 --> 01:25:05.110
All right, Violet. All right.

01:25:05.194 --> 01:25:07.738
You want the business, Violet?
All of the business?

01:25:07.821 --> 01:25:11.200
I'll fucking give it to you.
I'll give you all of it.

01:25:11.283 --> 01:25:13.744
I'm going to make you
fucking suffer,

01:25:13.827 --> 01:25:15.495
just like Shelly, Violet.

01:25:15.579 --> 01:25:17.915
Just like fucking Shelly.

01:25:23.463 --> 01:25:25.048
I'm sorry, Corky.

01:25:25.131 --> 01:25:28.718
Don't be sorry. Help me.

01:25:37.143 --> 01:25:39.562
Oh, no, no, no!

01:25:42.815 --> 01:25:45.860
Hey, Violet, you remember these?

01:25:48.446 --> 01:25:50.990
All right. I'm going
to start with Violet...

01:25:53.242 --> 01:25:56.995
So you get an idea
of what's coming.

01:26:02.501 --> 01:26:05.212
I'm gonna ask you 10 questions.

01:26:06.505 --> 01:26:10.133
Every time
I don't get an answer...

01:26:13.262 --> 01:26:15.848
I cut off a finger.

01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:25.441
Where's the money?

01:26:37.787 --> 01:26:39.497
It's Mickey.

01:26:43.751 --> 01:26:47.505
I said, where's the money?

01:26:49.048 --> 01:26:51.634
All right. I'll tell you.

01:26:51.718 --> 01:26:53.761
It's in the apartment
next door.

01:26:53.845 --> 01:26:56.973
- I put it in the paint drums.
- Good.

01:26:57.056 --> 01:27:00.810
Now, I promised you
I would kill you. Remember?

01:27:00.894 --> 01:27:05.648
- You can't kill me.
- Oh, really? Why not?

01:27:05.732 --> 01:27:08.484
I could be lying.

01:27:09.736 --> 01:27:13.072
You're gonna be sorry
you said that.

01:27:29.423 --> 01:27:31.091
Fuck!

01:27:34.637 --> 01:27:36.055
Son of a bitch.

01:27:42.228 --> 01:27:44.855
Keys. Keys. Keys. Keys.

01:28:31.609 --> 01:28:35.614
I can kill you right now
if that's what you want,

01:28:35.698 --> 01:28:40.452
or you can live,
but I need your help.

01:28:40.536 --> 01:28:43.706
Help me make Mickey believe
that everything's normal.

01:28:43.789 --> 01:28:47.126
Now, what do you want to do?

01:28:47.209 --> 01:28:49.461
You want to live?

01:29:21.827 --> 01:29:22.828
Ho!

01:29:22.912 --> 01:29:24.705
Oh, shit!

01:29:24.788 --> 01:29:29.335
Christ, Mickey.
You scared the shit out of me.

01:29:31.712 --> 01:29:33.923
What are you guys doing
with your peckers in your hand?

01:29:34.006 --> 01:29:35.841
You going to do me, Mickey?

01:29:37.551 --> 01:29:39.054
No, Cease. There was no answer.

01:29:39.137 --> 01:29:41.723
I thought I heard
some knocking at the door.

01:29:41.806 --> 01:29:43.475
I was buzzing, I was knocking.

01:29:43.558 --> 01:29:46.311
I guess you couldn't hear me on
account of being in the shower.

01:29:46.394 --> 01:29:49.439
You know, Mick,
I'm all wound up.

01:29:49.523 --> 01:29:51.900
I'm driving myself crazy
over this Gino thing,

01:29:51.983 --> 01:29:55.862
and, well, Vi, you know,
she thought maybe...

01:29:55.946 --> 01:30:01.034
she could, uh, you know,
relax me in the...

01:30:03.119 --> 01:30:06.414
That Violet is one nice lady.

01:30:08.166 --> 01:30:09.876
I wish someone
would help ME relax.

01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:15.005
Uh... let me get you guys
a drink, huh?

01:30:15.089 --> 01:30:20.135
I got Scotch, bourbon,
vodka... Whatever you want.

01:30:21.262 --> 01:30:22.930
We was worried about you, Cease.

01:30:23.013 --> 01:30:24.640
Me? Why?

01:30:24.723 --> 01:30:27.518
We went over to Johnnie's place
just to check it out.

01:30:27.601 --> 01:30:31.063
- It was busted up... bad.
- What?

01:30:31.146 --> 01:30:33.983
I started thinking,
maybe it's about the money.

01:30:34.066 --> 01:30:37.361
So I call you, but all I get
is the busy signal.

01:30:37.444 --> 01:30:40.239
I figure the phone is off the
hook. That's why I rushed here.

01:30:40.322 --> 01:30:42.408
The phone. Shit.

01:30:42.491 --> 01:30:45.704
That was me. I did that. Fuck!

01:30:45.787 --> 01:30:47.372
That was a stupid thing
to do, eh?

01:30:47.455 --> 01:30:52.002
Hey, if Violet
was helping me relax,

01:30:52.085 --> 01:30:56.006
I'd probably do the same thing.

01:31:17.986 --> 01:31:21.698
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

01:31:21.781 --> 01:31:26.286
Why did you move
all the furniture around?

01:31:29.581 --> 01:31:31.958
Let me guess.

01:31:32.042 --> 01:31:34.961
That was Violet's idea, too.

01:31:35.045 --> 01:31:37.214
Ha ha ha!

01:31:37.297 --> 01:31:40.717
Yeah, actually,

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:43.553
she was nervous
about Gino coming,

01:31:43.637 --> 01:31:45.514
wanted everything
to look perfect, and...

01:31:45.597 --> 01:31:49.143
- You know women, Mick.
- Sure, Cease.

01:31:49.227 --> 01:31:52.063
They make us do
stupid things, don't they?

01:31:58.819 --> 01:32:01.781
- Is that the money?
- Yeah, that's it.

01:32:01.864 --> 01:32:05.076
- What did it total out at?
- 2.176.

01:32:05.159 --> 01:32:08.496
That fucking Shelly.

01:32:08.579 --> 01:32:10.623
Gotta hand it to the guy,
but if I were him,

01:32:10.706 --> 01:32:13.292
I would've bailed
a long time ago.

01:32:13.376 --> 01:32:17.838
I mean, how much
money does a man need?

01:32:19.756 --> 01:32:24.094
I remember I was just staring
at all this goddamn money,

01:32:24.177 --> 01:32:27.472
Shelly down on his knees,

01:32:27.556 --> 01:32:29.474
and the next thing I know,

01:32:29.558 --> 01:32:32.936
Johnnie just blows his head off.

01:32:33.019 --> 01:32:35.772
What a fucking mess.

01:32:35.856 --> 01:32:37.607
Johnnie's laughing his ass off,

01:32:37.691 --> 01:32:42.696
and that's when Caesar
lost it, and boom,

01:32:42.779 --> 01:32:45.323
he cold-cocked him.

01:32:45.407 --> 01:32:49.452
He cold-cocks fucking
Johnnie Marzzone.

01:32:53.165 --> 01:32:56.836
Heee-eeey, Caesar.

01:33:00.214 --> 01:33:01.632
Where's the key?

01:33:01.716 --> 01:33:05.553
Um... the key..

01:33:07.388 --> 01:33:11.475
Oh. They're in my pants
in the bathroom.

01:33:11.559 --> 01:33:15.229
Ah, fuck it.
I don't need the key.

01:33:16.731 --> 01:33:19.442
I didn't need a key
to get in here, did I?

01:33:41.923 --> 01:33:44.217
Who the hell could that be?

01:33:49.096 --> 01:33:50.431
Are you gonna answer it?

01:33:50.515 --> 01:33:51.933
Yeah.

01:34:00.859 --> 01:34:03.529
- Hello?
- Hello, this is Gino.

01:34:03.612 --> 01:34:04.655
What?

01:34:04.738 --> 01:34:08.200
You're blowing your only chance,
asshole. Act like I'm Gino.

01:34:08.283 --> 01:34:12.746
Holy, Christ, we've been
worried sick about you, Gino!

01:34:12.829 --> 01:34:14.164
- Good boy.
- It's Gino.

01:34:14.248 --> 01:34:16.500
- Where the hell is he?
- We were in a car accident...

01:34:16.583 --> 01:34:17.960
They were in a car accident.

01:34:18.043 --> 01:34:19.127
But everybody's all right.

01:34:19.211 --> 01:34:21.880
Everybody's all right,
just bruises and shit.

01:34:21.964 --> 01:34:23.674
Un-fucking-believable.

01:34:23.757 --> 01:34:26.176
I called those
highway patrol dumb fucks.

01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:28.594
- I'm trying to hear Gino.
- Listen to me, asshole.

01:34:28.678 --> 01:34:30.513
I know your gun
is behind the bar.

01:34:30.596 --> 01:34:33.975
Either we make a deal,
or I hand this phone to Mickey.

01:34:34.058 --> 01:34:37.186
- I'm listening.
- All right.

01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:40.106
I want what's mine.
I want half the money.

01:34:40.189 --> 01:34:42.900
We get rid of Mickey,
and no one else dies.

01:34:42.984 --> 01:34:44.360
No one.

01:34:44.443 --> 01:34:48.114
- Say, "Yes, I understand. "
- Yes, I understand.

01:34:48.197 --> 01:34:51.492
Say I'm at St. Mary's, off the
Kennedy, in the waiting room.

01:34:51.576 --> 01:34:54.161
Stay on the phone
until I come out.

01:34:54.245 --> 01:34:57.206
OK. Right.

01:34:57.290 --> 01:35:00.961
St. Mary's, off
the Kennedy. Yeah.

01:35:01.044 --> 01:35:02.754
Johnnie's OK?

01:35:02.838 --> 01:35:05.132
Mickey, what are you doing here?

01:35:05.215 --> 01:35:08.093
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.
They were in a car accident.

01:35:08.176 --> 01:35:10.220
Oh, my God.
Is everybody all right?

01:35:10.304 --> 01:35:11.388
Everything's OK.

01:35:11.471 --> 01:35:14.683
Bye. They're at St. Mary's.
Can you fucking believe this?

01:35:14.766 --> 01:35:17.019
I can't fit them all
in my car. Give me your keys.

01:35:17.102 --> 01:35:18.437
Sure. Vi. Vi. Vi!

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:23.734
Do me a favour. Go in the
bathroom and get my keys, OK?

01:35:23.817 --> 01:35:27.654
Come on, let's go. Vi, let's go!

01:35:38.332 --> 01:35:39.458
Thanks, V.

01:35:39.541 --> 01:35:41.251
Call me as soon as
you get them, eh?

01:35:41.335 --> 01:35:43.795
Leave your phone on the hook.

01:35:48.175 --> 01:35:50.344
Now, that's teamwork.

01:35:50.427 --> 01:35:53.597
I should have let him kill you.

01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:57.601
- He would have done you, too.
- I knew I couldn't trust you.

01:35:57.684 --> 01:35:59.811
Relax.

01:35:59.895 --> 01:36:01.522
I said I would let you live,

01:36:01.605 --> 01:36:03.899
and I will...

01:36:03.982 --> 01:36:06.569
maybe.

01:36:14.911 --> 01:36:18.414
Let's go see if your dyke
was dumb enough to lie.

01:36:18.498 --> 01:36:20.250
Let's go.

01:36:45.816 --> 01:36:47.860
Yes.

01:36:47.943 --> 01:36:49.528
No!

01:36:53.156 --> 01:36:54.825
Violet!

01:37:01.248 --> 01:37:05.294
Violet!

01:37:09.716 --> 01:37:11.593
Violet!

01:37:44.918 --> 01:37:46.711
Please!

01:37:54.594 --> 01:37:55.803
Bitch.

01:37:55.887 --> 01:37:58.389
You fucking bitch!

01:38:21.038 --> 01:38:22.706
- Mickey?
- Violet?

01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:25.334
Oh, God, Mickey,
he made me do it.

01:38:25.417 --> 01:38:28.504
I was so afraid!
I didn't want to, Mickey.

01:38:28.587 --> 01:38:31.173
It was Caesar, all Caesar.
He made me help him.

01:38:31.257 --> 01:38:33.008
You have to help me.

01:38:33.092 --> 01:38:35.886
Oh, God! Oh, God, he's coming!

01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:53.027
Corky.

01:38:58.992 --> 01:39:01.035
Oh, fuck!

01:39:58.969 --> 01:40:00.763
Stop.

01:40:01.805 --> 01:40:03.641
Oh, for Chrissakes!

01:40:07.144 --> 01:40:09.730
It's over, Caesar.

01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:13.359
I called Mickey.
He's on his way.

01:40:15.277 --> 01:40:18.239
Get out of here, Caesar.

01:40:18.322 --> 01:40:20.991
If you want to live,
you better start running.

01:40:23.078 --> 01:40:25.747
All these years, Vi,
and you still don't know me...

01:40:28.959 --> 01:40:32.921
- But I know you.
- Caesar, don't.

01:40:33.588 --> 01:40:36.758
What are you going to do
with that, Vi? Shoot me?

01:40:36.841 --> 01:40:41.596
Kill me in cold blood?
I don't think so.

01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:44.182
If you were going to
shoot me, Vi,

01:40:44.266 --> 01:40:45.851
you'd have done it
a long time ago.

01:40:45.934 --> 01:40:48.645
If I were you, I'd have shot me

01:40:48.728 --> 01:40:50.814
the minute I brought the money
back to the apartment,

01:40:50.897 --> 01:40:55.151
but you didn't,
and I'll tell you why.

01:40:55.235 --> 01:40:58.112
You don't want to shoot me, Vi.

01:40:58.195 --> 01:41:00.239
Do you?

01:41:01.949 --> 01:41:03.951
Do you?

01:41:04.034 --> 01:41:06.245
I know you don't.

01:41:08.706 --> 01:41:12.418
Caesar, you don't know shit.

01:41:58.715 --> 01:42:01.218
I'll never
understand it, Mickey.

01:42:01.301 --> 01:42:02.719
You didn't even call the police.

01:42:02.802 --> 01:42:06.723
I told you. The family
doesn't want the police around.

01:42:06.806 --> 01:42:10.227
We want to take care of it
ourselves and we will.

01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:12.896
I'll find him.

01:42:12.979 --> 01:42:16.024
- I swear I will.
- I know you will.

01:42:18.235 --> 01:42:20.445
Sure you're going to be OK?

01:42:20.529 --> 01:42:22.364
I mean...

01:42:22.447 --> 01:42:25.116
If you're having
second thoughts,

01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:28.203
my offer still stands.

01:42:28.286 --> 01:42:30.497
Thanks, Mickey, but...

01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:32.124
I have to get out.

01:42:32.208 --> 01:42:36.087
You know, I have to get away
from all this.

01:42:36.170 --> 01:42:38.673
But thanks.

01:42:45.096 --> 01:42:47.557
Thanks for everything.

01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:22.674
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:43:22.757 --> 01:43:28.054
- So, how'd it go?
- I'm here, aren't I?

01:43:34.686 --> 01:43:37.273
Well, I thought
we might need a getaway car.

01:43:37.356 --> 01:43:38.482
Hmm.

01:43:40.818 --> 01:43:44.155
You know what the difference is
between me and you, Violet?

01:43:44.238 --> 01:43:46.157
No.

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:48.910
Me, neither.

01:43:55.499 --> 01:43:57.418
#Well, she's all
you'd ever want

01:43:57.501 --> 01:43:59.170
# She's the kind
I'd like to flaunt

01:43:59.253 --> 01:44:01.422
#And take to dinner

01:44:03.299 --> 01:44:05.301
#Well, she always
knows her place

01:44:05.384 --> 01:44:07.386
# She's got style
and she's got grace

01:44:07.470 --> 01:44:09.555
#And she's a winner

01:44:11.307 --> 01:44:13.768
# She's a lady

01:44:13.851 --> 01:44:17.688
#Whoa, whoa, whoa, she's a lady

01:44:17.772 --> 01:44:22.318
# Talking about that little lady

01:44:22.401 --> 01:44:25.613
#And the lady is mine

01:44:27.365 --> 01:44:29.325
#Well, she's never in the way

01:44:29.408 --> 01:44:31.369
#Always something nice to say

01:44:31.452 --> 01:44:33.704
#What a blessing

01:44:35.206 --> 01:44:37.500
# I can leave her on her own

01:44:37.583 --> 01:44:39.335
# Knowing she's OK alone

01:44:39.418 --> 01:44:41.797
#And there's no messin'

01:44:43.215 --> 01:44:45.842
# She's a lady

01:44:45.926 --> 01:44:49.972
#Whoa, whoa, whoa, she's a lady

01:44:50.055 --> 01:44:54.560
# Talking about that little lady

01:44:54.643 --> 01:44:58.230
#And the lady is mine

01:44:59.690 --> 01:45:02.109
# No, she never asks very much

01:45:02.192 --> 01:45:04.278
#And I don't refuse her

01:45:04.361 --> 01:45:06.029
#Always treat her with respect

01:45:06.113 --> 01:45:08.198
# I never would abuse her

01:45:08.282 --> 01:45:10.033
#What she's got is hard to find

01:45:10.117 --> 01:45:12.244
#And I don't want to lose her

01:45:12.327 --> 01:45:16.455
# Help me build a mountain
from a little pile of clay

01:45:16.539 --> 01:45:18.499
# Hey, hey, hey

01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:22.837
#Well, she knows what I'm about

01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:24.755
# She can take what I dish out

01:45:24.839 --> 01:45:26.716
#And that's not easy

01:45:26.799 --> 01:45:28.718
# Ooh, ooh, ooh

01:45:28.801 --> 01:45:30.720
#Well, she knows me
through and through

01:45:30.803 --> 01:45:32.597
#And she knows just what to do

01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:35.099
#And how to please me

01:45:35.183 --> 01:45:36.601
# Ooh, ooh, ooh

01:45:36.684 --> 01:45:39.312
# She's a lady

01:45:39.395 --> 01:45:43.441
#Whoa, whoa, whoa, she's a lady

01:45:43.524 --> 01:45:47.070
# Talking about the little lady

01:45:47.154 --> 01:45:48.155
#Whoo

01:45:48.238 --> 01:45:51.825
#And the lady is mine

01:45:51.909 --> 01:45:52.910
