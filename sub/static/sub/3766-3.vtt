00:01.937 --> 00:03.975
CASSIE: Previously on
Good Witch.

00:04.009 --> 00:06.847
It wasn't your herbs
or powders or whatever.

00:06.881 --> 00:07.983
I never thought it was.

00:08.017 --> 00:10.555
I did,
and for that I'm sorry.

00:10.589 --> 00:12.726
-Haven't seen
your dad around.
-My dad passed away.

00:12.759 --> 00:15.465
I dedicate this wing
in his honor.

00:15.499 --> 00:18.071
I just woke up one morning
with such a strong feeling

00:18.105 --> 00:20.542
that I needed
to share Grey House
with the world again.

00:20.575 --> 00:23.047
So George and I
are reopening
the bed and breakfast.

00:36.574 --> 00:38.378
-CASSIE: Can I help you?
-(GASPING)

00:41.015 --> 00:42.786
(SIGHING)

00:42.819 --> 00:43.921
I didn't see you there.

00:43.955 --> 00:46.025
Oh, I didn't mean
to startle you.

00:46.060 --> 00:47.095
Are you lost?

00:47.829 --> 00:49.433
I'm looking for Grey House.

00:49.467 --> 00:51.171
Well, you found it.

00:51.204 --> 00:53.241
I'm Cassie Nightingale,
the owner.

00:53.275 --> 00:54.810
I didn't make
a reservation, but...

00:54.843 --> 00:55.979
You don't need one.

00:56.681 --> 00:59.287
Oh! Great, thanks.

00:59.787 --> 01:00.822
Tired?

01:01.457 --> 01:02.559
I'm exhausted.

01:03.361 --> 01:04.697
Not just from traveling.

01:06.501 --> 01:07.736
Let's get you a room.

01:07.769 --> 01:10.108
We can work out
the paperwork tomorrow.

01:11.344 --> 01:13.881
So you're here
for the Heritage Ball
and 10K run?

01:13.915 --> 01:16.254
No. Yeah!

01:16.287 --> 01:18.925
No. No, vacation.

01:20.128 --> 01:22.031
Right. Well, I'm glad
we got that settled.

01:22.064 --> 01:23.668
Now let's get you settled.

01:25.472 --> 01:26.941
CASSIE: There you go.

01:31.551 --> 01:33.555
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:48.351 --> 01:50.755
Nick! Nick!

01:53.093 --> 01:54.129
He's at my house.

01:55.131 --> 01:57.269
(SIGHS) He's supposed
to be at his house.

01:57.303 --> 01:58.838
Oh, he didn't tell me that.

01:58.871 --> 02:02.077
-He's grounded.
-Didn't mention that either.

02:02.111 --> 02:04.048
But I sensed he was
hiding something.

02:04.081 --> 02:06.085
Nah, what you call hiding,
I call lying.

02:06.521 --> 02:07.556
(SIGHING)

02:08.491 --> 02:11.196
Sorry. It's been
a rough couple of weeks.

02:11.230 --> 02:13.133
-I'll send him home.
-Nah, it's okay.

02:13.167 --> 02:15.037
It's not like he's roaming
the streets.

02:15.070 --> 02:17.242
He's got adult supervision

02:17.275 --> 02:19.380
from an adult
he actually likes.

02:19.413 --> 02:20.915
Oh, he likes you.

02:20.949 --> 02:24.121
Well, who said being a parent
was a popularity contest?

02:24.156 --> 02:25.659
Matter of fact,
the more he dislikes me,

02:25.692 --> 02:27.496
-the more I know
I'm doing my job.
-(CHUCKLES)

02:27.529 --> 02:29.031
It's a thin line.

02:29.065 --> 02:31.571
Between love and hate?

02:31.604 --> 02:34.108
With Nick,
that line's almost invisible.

02:34.141 --> 02:35.912
That's what
he'd like you to believe.

02:36.213 --> 02:37.483
Hmm.

02:37.516 --> 02:40.020
So you're getting ready
for the big race?

02:40.053 --> 02:42.192
Oh, I don't race anymore.
I just run.

02:42.225 --> 02:43.795
Offset the caffeine,

02:43.828 --> 02:45.765
and the stress of
being a single parent.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.403
(ENGINE STARTING)

02:48.337 --> 02:49.339
What?

02:50.542 --> 02:52.446
Well, the whole town
is talking about you.

02:53.381 --> 02:54.550
Okay.

02:54.583 --> 02:56.587
But if you were at the race,

02:56.621 --> 02:58.425
the whole town
could talk to you.

02:58.991 --> 03:00.629
Okay.

03:00.662 --> 03:04.202
Thank you,
but no thanks, huh?

03:04.236 --> 03:05.605
You ever tried meditating?

03:05.639 --> 03:07.476
You know, instead of running.

03:07.509 --> 03:09.513
Uh, I don't have
time to meditate.

03:09.547 --> 03:12.419
Well, if you have time to run,
you have time to meditate.

03:12.453 --> 03:13.855
I don't like meditation.

03:13.888 --> 03:15.358
-You've tried it?
-No.

03:15.391 --> 03:16.927
Then how do you know
you don't like it?

03:16.961 --> 03:19.533
I don't have to try
walking on broken glass

03:19.567 --> 03:20.969
to know I wouldn't
like that either.

03:21.002 --> 03:22.606
It's an interesting analogy.

03:23.475 --> 03:26.012
(CHUCKLES)
I got to run.

03:28.951 --> 03:30.321
(CASSIE LAUGHING)

03:32.191 --> 03:33.327
(SIGHS)

03:35.599 --> 03:38.237
MARTHA: No, no, no!
The banner will
be the first thing

03:38.270 --> 03:39.973
that people see when
they enter Middleton.

03:40.007 --> 03:41.911
You do not get
a second chance...

03:41.944 --> 03:43.247
BOTH: At a first impression.

03:43.280 --> 03:44.850
DEREK: Yeah.

03:44.883 --> 03:46.721
Our banner must be majestic.

03:46.754 --> 03:50.629
It must wave and announce,
not block and annoy.

03:51.631 --> 03:53.166
-Annoy?
-Yes.

03:53.199 --> 03:56.005
When people literally
run into the banner,
they will be annoyed.

03:56.039 --> 03:58.811
You know, it's a fun run,
and dance.

03:58.845 --> 04:01.851
Look what our centennial
did for us a few years back.

04:01.884 --> 04:04.857
Why, this festival could be
a game changer for Middleton.

04:04.890 --> 04:06.894
I mean, who knows
what might come next?

04:06.927 --> 04:09.332
A food festival,
a jazz festival.

04:09.366 --> 04:13.039
(GASPING) Maybe even
a film festival.

04:13.073 --> 04:14.810
I have big plans for this year

04:14.843 --> 04:17.916
and they all start and end
on the success
of the Heritage Festival.

04:18.517 --> 04:19.753
(SIGHING)

04:19.787 --> 04:21.022
Oh! Madam Mayor!

04:29.640 --> 04:32.044
-GRACE: Mom?
-Mmm-hmm?

04:32.077 --> 04:33.648
Why is Nick here?

04:33.681 --> 04:35.284
Uh, he just showed up.

04:35.318 --> 04:37.221
-Oh, he has a home.
-Yes.

04:37.254 --> 04:39.058
So please send him back there.

04:39.091 --> 04:40.528
I think he might surprise you.

04:40.561 --> 04:42.866
Oh! He surprised me

04:42.899 --> 04:44.436
when he almost let me
take the fall

04:44.469 --> 04:46.607
-for stealing
the school mascot.
-Almost.

04:46.641 --> 04:48.176
(SIGHS) Mom,

04:48.209 --> 04:49.579
I see a lot of things,

04:49.613 --> 04:51.917
but the one thing
I don't see is that
Nick is a good guy.

04:55.358 --> 04:57.395
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

04:58.631 --> 05:01.336
It's not me. It's Anthony.

05:01.370 --> 05:03.675
I think something's wrong
with his family.

05:04.877 --> 05:06.981
But maybe I'm wrong, right?

05:07.014 --> 05:08.718
And maybe what I see
won't happen.

05:10.621 --> 05:12.157
I'll keep a good thought
for Anthony.

05:13.360 --> 05:14.396
Thanks, Mom.

join us.

Again.

05:26.252 --> 05:27.321
Thanks, Cassie.

05:32.064 --> 05:33.266
Just for the record,

05:34.402 --> 05:36.707
I came here for the food,
not the company.

05:36.741 --> 05:38.143
(CHUCKLES FORCIBLY)

05:38.176 --> 05:41.483
So you decided to run
the 10K after all?

05:41.516 --> 05:43.620
I thought
I'd just walk briskly,

05:43.654 --> 05:45.491
and finish sometime
before nightfall.

05:46.125 --> 05:47.863
It's good to have goals.

05:47.896 --> 05:50.267
Hmm, how about all of you?

05:50.300 --> 05:52.505
Well, I love
the Heritage Festival.

05:52.538 --> 05:54.041
And the run?

05:54.075 --> 05:58.083
Hmm, about the only way
you could get me
to love a 10K run

05:58.116 --> 06:00.621
is if you put Ryan Gosling
at the finish line.

06:03.126 --> 06:06.400

at a Heritage Festival?

06:06.433 --> 06:08.971
Oh, the locals gather
under a full moon

06:09.005 --> 06:10.508
and sacrifice anyone
from New York.

We start the morning
with the race

06:14.616 --> 06:16.219
and we end the day
with a big ball.

06:16.586 --> 06:17.823
Oh.

06:17.856 --> 06:19.692
The whole town is invited.
You should come.

06:19.726 --> 06:22.632
Um, I don't do fun runs.

06:22.665 --> 06:23.868
Oh, you sound
just like your dad.

06:24.803 --> 06:26.506
I'm nothing like my father.

I'm, uh,

06:48.417 --> 06:50.488
just not used
to having company
when I run.

06:50.521 --> 06:52.024
'Cause in New York,
I always ran alone.

06:52.057 --> 06:53.928
Yeah? Well, you're
not alone anymore.

06:53.961 --> 06:55.197
That's what I see.

Oh, well, I can keep up
with you, don't you worry.

I actually started doing this
because of you.

07:01.142 --> 07:02.244
Pardon me?

07:02.277 --> 07:04.649
Well, at my first appointment,
you told me to take up

07:04.682 --> 07:06.486
some sort of exercise
program, remember?

07:06.520 --> 07:07.655
I've always liked running.

07:07.688 --> 07:08.724
I tell a lot
of my patients that,

07:08.757 --> 07:09.826

ever listen to me.

07:23.654 --> 07:24.689
I need to pay you.

07:25.524 --> 07:27.127
Do you take cash?

07:27.161 --> 07:29.065
Wow, you never
see that anymore.

07:29.098 --> 07:31.135

to have cards,

to have cash.

-And it's totally fine.

I'm really not hungry.

07:42.959 --> 07:45.864
By the way,
my plans might change.

07:45.898 --> 07:49.305
I don't know if
I'll be here too long.

07:49.338 --> 07:52.645

you stop by the shop
before you leave.

07:52.678 --> 07:53.981
Bell, Book and Candle.

07:55.150 --> 07:56.686
Sounds very mysterious.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.189
No, there's no mystery.

At least not at the shop.

are two entirely
different things.

trouble with my left knee.

I just don't want
to be out of commission
for the big race.

08:40.908 --> 08:43.479
You're new in town
so you probably don't know
that I'm undefeated,

08:43.513 --> 08:45.651
but this is what happens
when I overtrain.

08:45.684 --> 08:47.622
It's fluid retention,
but it's not infected.

08:47.655 --> 08:48.757
I know what that feels like,

08:48.790 --> 08:50.260
so I don't need antibiotics,
but I thought I'd...

08:50.293 --> 08:51.896
Do you mind if I
take a look at it?

08:52.364 --> 08:54.067
Yeah, go ahead.

No, I don't do fun runs.

09:02.785 --> 09:04.488
10K is not exactly a fun run.

09:04.521 --> 09:06.826
(CHUCKLES) Well,
it's not a marathon.

09:06.860 --> 09:08.095
Well, it's over six miles.

09:08.529 --> 09:09.531
Fun!

09:10.267 --> 09:11.736
You know what
I think is fun?

09:11.770 --> 09:12.972
Winning.

09:13.005 --> 09:15.678
Now see, if I ran,
I'd spoil all your fun.

09:15.711 --> 09:16.946
That's impossible.

09:16.980 --> 09:18.149
(CHUCKLES)

09:18.183 --> 09:20.654
I graduated from
medical school in three years.

09:20.688 --> 09:22.157
Nothing's impossible.

09:22.191 --> 09:23.393
Yeah, I know.

09:23.426 --> 09:25.197
I was All-America in track.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.301
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

09:27.334 --> 09:28.536
-Me too!
-No way!

09:28.570 --> 09:29.872
High school's
a long time ago, though.

09:29.906 --> 09:31.810
Yeah, a little longer
for you than for me, huh?

09:33.213 --> 09:34.281
Oh, and for the record,

09:34.315 --> 09:36.452
I was All-American
in high school and college.

09:36.485 --> 09:38.189
-That's impressive!
-Thank you.

09:38.223 --> 09:39.726
But I gotta say,

09:39.759 --> 09:42.163
once you've run the New York
and Boston marathons
in the same year,

09:42.197 --> 09:45.036
everything just pales
in comparison.

09:45.069 --> 09:46.673
Which means I'm not running.

09:46.706 --> 09:50.079
And neither are you
if I don't drain that knee.

09:50.112 --> 09:52.116
Is this gonna hurt?

09:52.150 --> 09:53.920
Only if I want it to.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

10:10.152 --> 10:11.756
Sorry. (CLEARS THROAT)

10:14.194 --> 10:16.399

10:16.432 --> 10:17.835
-(CHUCKLING) Uh, I don't know.
-(DOORBELL CHIMING)

10:18.804 --> 10:19.839
Do you have a problem?

10:23.012 --> 10:24.415
Uh, kind of.

10:24.448 --> 10:25.718
(CHUCKLES)

10:27.153 --> 10:28.589
Hey, Cass, do you think...

10:30.728 --> 10:31.930
Do you have something

10:31.963 --> 10:34.435
that might be able to help me
out with women?

10:35.303 --> 10:36.505
Help?

10:36.539 --> 10:38.609
Well, I've had a lot
of first dates lately,

10:38.644 --> 10:40.881
but not a lot of second dates.

10:41.482 --> 10:43.252
CASSIE: Ah!

10:43.285 --> 10:45.658
I sense that you have
a vacancy in your life

10:45.691 --> 10:46.860
that's about to be filled.

10:47.293 --> 10:48.295
Yeah?

10:50.934 --> 10:52.437
Okay! (CHUCKLES)

10:52.471 --> 10:54.909
And I don't need anything?

10:54.942 --> 10:57.347
Everything you need for love,
you already possess.

10:58.984 --> 11:00.888
-Thanks, Cass.
-Anytime.

11:03.459 --> 11:04.762
He's sweet.

11:04.796 --> 11:06.632
-(DOORBELL CHIMING)
-(LAUGHS)

11:06.665 --> 11:09.337
God, I hate it
when they love to exercise.

11:09.371 --> 11:12.343
I haven't run this much
since that orthodontist
in Waresville.

11:13.212 --> 11:16.786
Well, here.
Try this two times a day,

11:16.820 --> 11:20.326
and, uh, before you
go chasing, uh,
I mean, running.

11:20.359 --> 11:21.562
(SCOFFING)

11:21.595 --> 11:24.769
Not all of us can
live next to the hottest
bachelor in town.

11:24.802 --> 11:26.472
If there's an easier way
to get that man alone

11:26.505 --> 11:29.578
that doesn't involve
sore feet and wearing
a paper exam gown,

11:29.611 --> 11:30.881
I'm all ears.

11:30.914 --> 11:31.916
(CASSIE CHUCKLES)

11:32.651 --> 11:34.120
-Hello!
-Hi.

11:35.289 --> 11:36.893
-I'm in town for the...
-For the 10K.

11:37.828 --> 11:38.830
Yeah.

11:39.431 --> 11:40.834
Uh, be careful.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.940
Your gait is off,
which is straining your back,

11:43.974 --> 11:46.178
causing some bad
muscle spasms, I bet.

11:46.211 --> 11:48.115
She's like a holistic
Sherlock Holmes.

11:50.788 --> 11:53.493
So, uh, what brings
you to my shop?

11:53.526 --> 11:54.796
Well, to be honest,
memories.

11:54.829 --> 11:56.398
Really?

11:56.431 --> 11:58.503
I met my lovely wife
in Middleton.

11:58.536 --> 12:00.741
I asked her to marry me
right on this very spot.

12:00.774 --> 12:04.548
Mind you, way back then,
this was an open field,
not a shop.

12:04.581 --> 12:05.583
And she's passed on.

12:06.619 --> 12:07.888
It's hard to let go.

12:09.525 --> 12:12.463
I'm also here
to fulfill a promise.

12:12.497 --> 12:15.703
My wife always wanted
to run across the state
one 10K at a time.

12:16.705 --> 12:18.609
She got sick, didn't finish.

12:18.643 --> 12:21.148
I promised
to finish it for her,

12:21.181 --> 12:23.519
and Middleton's my last race.

12:23.553 --> 12:24.756
It's good to keep
our promises.

12:32.972 --> 12:34.440
How was your walk?

12:35.442 --> 12:36.645
My walk?

12:37.113 --> 12:39.718
Oh, right. Um...

12:39.751 --> 12:40.821
It was great.

12:49.504 --> 12:52.543
Well, I...
I can see you're busy.

12:52.577 --> 12:55.549
I'll, um, see you back
at the house.

Try this,
for your hip and back.

13:08.308 --> 13:11.214
By the way, have you, uh,
have you seen Grey House?

13:12.116 --> 13:14.420
I heard it was abandoned
and boarded up.

13:14.454 --> 13:17.060
Oh, no.
No, it's very much alive.

13:17.093 --> 13:20.599
Some people say
I brought it back to life,
but the truth is

13:20.633 --> 13:22.336
Grey House actually
brought me back to life.

13:23.706 --> 13:25.643
It's a magical place.

13:25.677 --> 13:28.015
(CHUCKLES)
I'd love to see it.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.519

I cheated on you.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.055
I went to see Sam.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.392
(LAUGHING) I'm not
in competition with Sam.

13:50.426 --> 13:52.063
I believe in western medicine.

13:52.096 --> 13:53.532
So what would
you have said?

13:53.565 --> 13:55.436
That your knee
is talking to you

13:55.469 --> 13:57.741
and it's saying,
"Stop training so hard."

13:57.774 --> 14:00.012
I can't help it. I'm a guy.

14:00.046 --> 14:01.581
I always want to win.

14:02.350 --> 14:04.220
You know what I mean.

14:04.254 --> 14:05.790
Don't you think
you could ease off a little,

14:05.823 --> 14:07.226
now that you know
Sam isn't running?

14:09.430 --> 14:11.201
I'm not competing
against Sam.

14:12.203 --> 14:13.806
If you say so.

so very fit in your
little running outfit?

Well, I can lead you to water,
but it is you who must drink,

14:43.967 --> 14:45.569
or run,
as the case may be.

14:45.602 --> 14:46.839
What about you?
Are you running?

14:46.872 --> 14:48.708
Me? (SCOFFS) Heavens no!

14:48.742 --> 14:50.679
My fellow citizens
and constituents

14:50.712 --> 14:52.150
don't want to see
their esteemed mayor

running down the middle
of the street all sweaty.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.491
No, I officiate.
And I hand out the medals.

Oh.

14:58.128 --> 14:59.364
"Oh?"

14:59.397 --> 15:02.103
"Oh?" And what is "oh"
supposed to mean?

15:02.136 --> 15:03.873
Nothing.

15:03.907 --> 15:06.578
I could run,
should I choose to do so.

15:06.611 --> 15:08.348
I didn't say you couldn't.

15:08.382 --> 15:10.719

your chall-ah-nge.

If you're out of that oil,
you're using too much.

15:43.052 --> 15:44.654
You want to ask
about Ashley?

15:46.424 --> 15:47.760
Yeah, that's her name?

15:48.628 --> 15:50.366
Yes.
You know her?

15:51.734 --> 15:53.072
I know someone like her,
that's all.

15:53.974 --> 15:56.144
-Just someone?
-Yeah.

15:57.180 --> 15:58.782
I see.

15:58.815 --> 16:00.152
It's troubling to talk about.

16:00.186 --> 16:01.788
Well, for me,
the truth is big trouble.

16:03.158 --> 16:06.164
Maybe you could use
some comfort food.

16:06.198 --> 16:07.700
Food I don't need.

16:07.733 --> 16:10.106
Sometimes we don't know
what we need till we find it.

is excellent.

-You're a runner, right?
-Yeah.

16:37.793 --> 16:38.962
You could help him.

16:39.964 --> 16:41.268
And why would I do that?

16:42.270 --> 16:45.476
(SIGHS) Sorry,
what was I thinking,

16:45.509 --> 16:47.646
asking you to care about
something besides yourself?

16:48.315 --> 16:49.384
That's just crazy.

16:49.817 --> 16:51.654
Well, see you.

17:06.884 --> 17:08.955
She's very pretty.

17:08.988 --> 17:11.128
It's Catherine, my daughter.

Nice.

17:13.064 --> 17:16.002
I haven't spoken to her
in a long time.

17:16.771 --> 17:19.110
Well, all hope can't be lost.

17:19.144 --> 17:20.546
She sent you that picture.

17:20.579 --> 17:23.752
Well, actually, I found it
when my wife died.

17:23.785 --> 17:27.024
She'd been in touch
with Catherine
for a long time.

17:27.059 --> 17:28.228
Didn't tell me about it.

17:29.096 --> 17:31.668

getting ready upstairs.
Want me to get her?

18:32.990 --> 18:34.427
Getting ready?

18:34.460 --> 18:36.798
Uh, yeah. She's meeting
Ryan for dinner.

18:37.400 --> 18:38.435
Oh, really?

18:38.968 --> 18:40.539
I can get her.

18:40.572 --> 18:42.776
No. No, I just wanted
to bring this back.

18:42.810 --> 18:44.280
Tell her it was delicious,

18:44.314 --> 18:47.586
-and sweet of her
to take pity on us...
-(CHUCKLES)

18:47.620 --> 18:48.888

18:48.922 --> 18:51.361
I will tell her. Thanks.

Actually, I should
probably thank you.

18:53.598 --> 18:56.504
Um, Nick's helping
Anthony work out,
to get ready for the run.

18:56.538 --> 18:58.675
-He said it was your idea.
-Me?

18:58.708 --> 19:01.213
I know he's doing it
mostly just to get out
of being grounded

19:01.247 --> 19:02.950
and get out
of the house at night.

19:02.983 --> 19:04.954
-At night?
-'Cause Anthony has band
after school.

19:05.589 --> 19:07.192
He does?

19:07.225 --> 19:09.530
So the only time
that Nick can train him
is at night after dinner.

19:09.564 --> 19:10.832
That makes sense.

19:10.866 --> 19:14.340
So anyway, thanks
for planting the idea.

19:14.374 --> 19:17.446
He's a good kid,
even though
he tries to hide it.

19:27.332 --> 19:30.338
No, no, it's completely fine
that you called.

19:30.372 --> 19:33.244
Really, your knee again?

No, no, that sounds
kind of serious.

I was there for you.
We're even.

19:55.889 --> 19:57.091
It's not easy being alone.

19:57.860 --> 19:59.497
Meaning?

19:59.530 --> 20:01.668
No, it's just...
It's nice you and I
have each other.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.472
Yes! Yes.

-What are you trying to say?
-I'm not.

20:06.944 --> 20:09.015
Yes, yes, you are.
You're doing that thing
that you do

20:09.048 --> 20:11.387
when you say it
without actually saying it.

20:11.420 --> 20:12.490
What are you trying to say?

20:13.992 --> 20:15.395
Is this about Sam?

20:16.898 --> 20:19.436
Because Sam is not alone.
He's got his kid, right?

20:22.342 --> 20:25.549
Okay, so maybe he feels
like he's alone because
he's new in town,

20:25.582 --> 20:28.254
but maybe, just maybe,
that's by choice.

20:28.287 --> 20:30.425
Because people
from the big city,
they're like that.

20:30.458 --> 20:31.994
They just like to be
by themselves, right?

20:32.028 --> 20:34.600
-No, no one chooses
to be alone.
-Hermits do.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.704
-I'm serious.
-No, I'm serious.

20:36.738 --> 20:38.942
Hermits, by definition,
are loners.

20:38.975 --> 20:40.311
Sam's not a hermit.

20:40.345 --> 20:44.419
Look, small town life
is just not for everyone.

20:46.891 --> 20:49.930
All I'm saying is
that alone or not,

20:49.964 --> 20:53.471
I'm not so sure that Sam
is long for Middleton.

20:53.504 --> 20:56.310

some help, he's not.

-Dr. Radford.
-Sam.

how you did this.

Did what?

hurt your knee?

21:54.258 --> 21:56.330
I tripped.

21:56.998 --> 21:58.033
(CHUCKLES)

21:59.837 --> 22:01.072
Yeah.

22:02.575 --> 22:04.178
(CLEARS THROAT)

22:06.918 --> 22:07.920
Uh...

22:09.188 --> 22:10.190
(CLEARS THROAT)

22:13.765 --> 22:14.767
Hi.

22:17.004 --> 22:18.441
Hi.

22:18.474 --> 22:19.944
Are you new in town?

22:20.779 --> 22:22.014
Um...

22:23.718 --> 22:25.655
That sounded cheesy.
Sorry.

22:28.427 --> 22:30.030
I'll try it again.

22:33.972 --> 22:35.541
(SIGHING)

22:36.643 --> 22:37.645
Hi.

22:39.383 --> 22:41.019
-Hi.
-Was that better?

22:41.052 --> 22:42.221
(CHUCKLING)

22:43.156 --> 22:45.060
(CELLPHONE BUZZING)

22:47.164 --> 22:49.770
-Hello?
-Hey!

22:49.804 --> 22:51.006
What are you up to?

22:51.039 --> 22:53.845
Um, training, really hard.
(CHUCKLES)

22:53.878 --> 22:56.049
(CHUCKLES)
Is Nick with you?

22:56.082 --> 22:57.652
-Sure.
-Yeah?

22:57.685 --> 22:59.523
Yeah, we just finished
our algebra homework,

22:59.556 --> 23:02.662
and we're in the middle
of a killer game of Halo.
(LAUGHS)

23:03.330 --> 23:04.566
I'm serious.

23:04.599 --> 23:07.104
No, if you were serious,
you wouldn't have
asked the question.

23:09.008 --> 23:12.081
Wait, why would Nick
be with me?

23:12.114 --> 23:15.320
Well, he's helping you train
for the 10K.

23:15.354 --> 23:18.527
Look, Nick doesn't talk to me
unless it's to insult me.

23:18.561 --> 23:20.297
He's gonna train me?

23:20.631 --> 23:21.767
He lied.

23:21.800 --> 23:24.606
Yeah, he does that,
like, all the time.

23:25.741 --> 23:29.115
I just can't believe
you fell for it.

23:29.148 --> 23:31.587
It wasn't just me
who fell for it.

23:38.266 --> 23:39.469
(SIGHING)

23:39.503 --> 23:41.941
Whatever swelling you had
seems to have gone down.

23:41.974 --> 23:44.212
Well, you must have
the magic touch.

23:44.245 --> 23:45.481
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

23:46.249 --> 23:48.153
So, what's my prognosis?

23:49.022 --> 23:51.359
Well, I think
you're going to live.

23:51.392 --> 23:52.729
(CHUCKLING)

23:52.762 --> 23:55.635
But maybe I won't see you
on my morning run for a while.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.204
Oh, I don't know about that.

23:57.238 --> 23:58.908
I'm a very fast healer.

24:01.012 --> 24:02.181
Oh, no!

24:03.183 --> 24:05.888
I drag you all the way
out here on a cold night

24:05.922 --> 24:07.158
to help poor little old me,

24:07.191 --> 24:08.962
the least I can do
is offer you a drink

24:08.995 --> 24:09.997
and some hors d'oeuvres.

24:10.999 --> 24:12.970
-Well...
-Stay.

24:14.138 --> 24:15.708
Please, I insist.

24:16.810 --> 24:18.614
-You do?
-(CHUCKLES)

24:18.647 --> 24:20.050
Well, Nick's out
running tonight,

24:20.084 --> 24:22.421
so there's no need
for me to race home.

24:22.454 --> 24:24.893
He's actually training Anthony
for the race.

24:24.926 --> 24:27.164
It's the first effort that
I've seen him make
since we moved here.

24:27.198 --> 24:29.636
Aw. Canape?

24:36.984 --> 24:38.921
-Hey.
-Hi.

24:40.190 --> 24:41.893
-Thanks.
-Problem?

24:43.931 --> 24:44.966
Kind of.

24:45.801 --> 24:47.404
Do you want to tell me?

24:48.440 --> 24:50.645
Nick used me
to lie to his dad.

24:50.678 --> 24:52.549
Mmm, and you're angry.

24:53.584 --> 24:55.187
Yeah.

24:55.220 --> 24:57.458
This is the second time
that he's put me
in this position.

24:58.493 --> 25:01.633
I have to rat him out
or be part of his lie.

25:04.138 --> 25:06.543
There may be a third option

25:06.577 --> 25:09.616
that lets Nick know
to stop using you
as an option altogether.

25:15.094 --> 25:17.431
All right, I feel like
I've been doing
all the talking.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.769
I like listening to you.

25:19.803 --> 25:21.707
It's just that you know
so much about me

25:21.740 --> 25:23.210
and I don't know
that much about you.

25:24.312 --> 25:25.548
Oh...

25:26.516 --> 25:27.552
Sorry.

25:27.585 --> 25:29.522
No! No, no, no, it's okay.

25:30.390 --> 25:31.392
Are you staying in town long?

25:31.960 --> 25:33.196
My plans are...

25:33.230 --> 25:34.365
They're kind of up in the air.

25:34.933 --> 25:36.436
All right, well,

25:36.469 --> 25:38.406
what can we do to
bring them down to Earth?

25:38.440 --> 25:39.776
(CHUCKLING) I...

25:41.747 --> 25:44.252
-I could use a job.
-A job?

25:44.285 --> 25:46.890
-Yeah.
-All right.

25:46.923 --> 25:48.994
Yeah, I could probably
help you out with that.

25:49.629 --> 25:51.031
(LAUGHS)

25:52.501 --> 25:53.571
Thank you.

26:00.484 --> 26:02.922
So, why am I here exactly?

26:03.356 --> 26:04.425
What?

26:04.458 --> 26:06.128
Why did you want me
to come over?

26:06.162 --> 26:08.634
Oh, um, to hang.

26:08.667 --> 26:10.270
We hung earlier today.

26:13.711 --> 26:17.318
(SIGHING) It's getting late.
Time to go.

26:17.351 --> 26:19.522
You're acting really weird.

26:19.555 --> 26:21.459
-Am I? I just must be tired.
-Yeah.

26:21.492 --> 26:22.528
Okay, good night.

26:22.561 --> 26:24.532
-Okay, good night.
-Bye.

26:34.452 --> 26:36.556
-Hey, Anthony.
-Hey, Dr. Radford.

26:36.589 --> 26:38.360
Uh, are you and Nick
finished for the night?

26:39.194 --> 26:40.765
Um...

26:40.798 --> 26:42.033
Finished with what?

27:06.115 --> 27:07.618

27:11.793 --> 27:12.829
-Hey.
-Hey.

27:12.862 --> 27:14.332
I saw you were up.

27:14.365 --> 27:17.237
I am. So are you.
Come on in.

27:18.473 --> 27:20.043
I don't want to interrupt.

27:20.510 --> 27:21.980
Interrupt?

27:22.013 --> 27:23.550
Is Ryan here?

27:23.583 --> 27:26.155
-No, he isn't.
-Oh, okay.

27:27.524 --> 27:29.528
-Uh, let's go inside.
-All right.

27:31.599 --> 27:33.302
-Have a seat.
-(SIGHS)

27:33.336 --> 27:35.106
I promise not
to make you meditate.

27:35.139 --> 27:36.609
I'm not drinking
any tea either.

27:36.642 --> 27:38.446
Okay, well,
ground rules are settled.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.851
-(BOTH CHUCKLING)
-I don't have any coffee.
But...

27:40.885 --> 27:42.087
How about pie?

27:42.120 --> 27:44.592
-Ooh, that bad, huh?
-Yeah.

27:44.625 --> 27:45.695
And you got
any ice cream?

27:46.429 --> 27:48.232
Vegan. It's made
with nut butter.

27:48.265 --> 27:51.338
Ugh! If it's not made
with cream,
it can't be ice cream.

27:51.372 --> 27:52.508
Try it.

27:52.541 --> 27:55.380
I'm allergic to anything
not made with animal products.

27:56.983 --> 27:58.453
Ugh!

27:59.856 --> 28:02.260
I don't know what to do!

28:02.293 --> 28:06.268
Nick's got me on the mat
and the referee
is counting down.

28:06.301 --> 28:08.907
I hate to admit it,
but he's winning.

28:08.941 --> 28:11.045
Winning, but not won.

28:11.078 --> 28:12.247
It's not over yet.

28:12.280 --> 28:13.851
No, not yet.

28:15.721 --> 28:18.092
Sounds like you need
a new game plan.

28:24.672 --> 28:27.745
Oh, Cassie!
I'm in big trouble.

28:27.779 --> 28:31.218
I... I can't even run
around the block
without needing oxygen.

28:31.251 --> 28:33.924
-Why are you doing that?
-I have been challenged.

28:33.957 --> 28:35.795
-You have?
-Yes, by Dr. Radford.

28:35.828 --> 28:37.163
-Really?
-Yes, and...

28:37.197 --> 28:38.566
(PANTING)

28:38.600 --> 28:42.273
And Martha Tinsdale
does not back down
from a challenge.

28:42.942 --> 28:44.111
Although,

28:44.144 --> 28:46.917
Martha Tinsdale has never
actually run in a race before.

28:46.950 --> 28:48.419
Any kind of a race.

28:48.452 --> 28:52.093
So I thought I, perhaps,
should do a trial run.

28:52.127 --> 28:53.831
You know,
see how it feels.

28:53.864 --> 28:56.335
And if feels awful!

28:56.368 --> 28:59.474
Why in heaven's name
would anyone
volunteer to do this.

28:59.508 --> 29:01.980
My feet hurt,
my back hurts.

29:02.013 --> 29:05.419
Oh, Cassie, I don't know
how I'm gonna be
able to finish.

29:05.453 --> 29:09.027
Well, Martha, you really
shouldn't just jump into
an exercise program.

29:09.061 --> 29:10.931
Huh?

29:10.965 --> 29:14.204
Not without, uh,
having a thorough
medical examination.

29:14.906 --> 29:16.175

29:16.777 --> 29:17.879
Oh!

29:20.149 --> 29:22.621
Mmm-hmm. Hmm.

29:26.461 --> 29:28.532
I'm getting to him,
I can tell.

29:28.566 --> 29:30.403
I am wearing him down.

29:34.277 --> 29:35.647
What?

29:35.680 --> 29:38.185
Well, just be careful
not to chase too hard.

29:38.219 --> 29:40.991
He might pick up the pace
and outrun you.

29:46.301 --> 29:48.606
-Ladies.
-CASSIE: Hello, Sam!

29:48.640 --> 29:50.076
I should probably
get back to my shop.

29:50.109 --> 29:51.145
Don't leave on my account.

29:51.178 --> 29:53.282

-Sounds great.

No, no. It's on the house.

30:02.367 --> 30:04.304
Thanks! How's your knee?

30:05.206 --> 30:06.977
Remarkably better!

30:07.010 --> 30:08.981
So I'll be seeing you
on my morning run?

30:16.863 --> 30:17.932
Will I be seeing you?

30:22.808 --> 30:24.913
No.

30:24.946 --> 30:26.248
I think my running days
are over.

30:26.648 --> 30:28.152
Hmm.

30:28.185 --> 30:31.125
And, maybe
I'm overdoing it a little
with the doctor visits.

30:32.527 --> 30:33.562
Really?

30:34.698 --> 30:37.972
Oh, I'll miss you
at the office.

30:41.712 --> 30:44.084
-I should go.
-Okay!

31:14.744 --> 31:17.650
-What's up?
-You hired Ashley?

31:17.683 --> 31:19.421
You know nothing about her!

31:19.454 --> 31:20.891
This isn't the NSA.

31:20.925 --> 31:23.195
She's answering calls
and making coffee.

31:23.229 --> 31:25.299
Plus she's got a lot
of office experience.

31:25.333 --> 31:27.838
You know, she knows things
about the phones
that I don't even know.

31:27.871 --> 31:29.241
Did you run
a background check?

31:29.274 --> 31:31.045
Yeah, she's filling out
the paper work.

31:32.513 --> 31:34.818
There's something
off about her.

31:34.852 --> 31:37.457
I've been doing this
longer than you have,
she's fine.

31:38.025 --> 31:39.727
And she's a find!

31:39.761 --> 31:41.531
I took her out
for dinner last night.

31:41.565 --> 31:43.769
-A date?
-Not exactly.

31:45.339 --> 31:46.441

31:54.491 --> 31:56.695
You're cleared to run,
just take it easy.

31:56.728 --> 31:58.765
Okay, great! Thanks!

32:01.973 --> 32:03.542
You know,
you should do the race.

32:05.013 --> 32:06.916
Really? Why?

32:06.950 --> 32:09.821
Because small towns live
and die by relationships.

32:09.854 --> 32:13.395
And the run is a good way
to start making
more friends in town.

32:13.429 --> 32:15.199
Is this you
trying to help me?

32:15.233 --> 32:16.268
Maybe.

32:16.701 --> 32:18.172
Ha!

32:18.205 --> 32:21.578

I just like the competition.

I don't want to
see you fold up,
head back to New York.

being the best is defined

to win the race laying down.

I'm not running.

32:56.348 --> 32:57.383
Okay.

32:59.087 --> 33:00.123
What happened?

33:01.591 --> 33:02.893
My dad left last night.

33:04.197 --> 33:06.468
-Sorry.
-Me too.

33:07.903 --> 33:09.141
He could come back.

33:12.247 --> 33:15.353
I heard my mom talking
to some lawyer.

33:15.386 --> 33:17.323
He's not coming back.

-It's not stupid.
-Well, I am.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.604
-You're hopeful.
-Me, hopeful?

33:25.639 --> 33:26.708
Yeah.

33:28.145 --> 33:31.251
You hoped that
if you ran in the race,

33:32.353 --> 33:33.955
your parents would
show up together

33:34.824 --> 33:36.695
to watch you run.

33:36.728 --> 33:39.534
Like they used to
when we played
peewee soccer.

33:39.567 --> 33:41.071
-(BOTH CHUCKLE)
-Yeah.

33:41.105 --> 33:43.675
And if they
showed up together,

33:45.079 --> 33:46.915
maybe they'd stay together.

33:48.219 --> 33:50.789
-Like I said, it's stupid.
-Hopeful.

33:52.693 --> 33:55.633
And you're running.
And I am too!

33:55.666 --> 33:59.174
-You don't have to run.
-But I do.

34:04.317 --> 34:07.590
Thank you for coming.
I am, as you know,
a very busy woman.

34:07.623 --> 34:10.363
Now, I think
that I am perfectly able
to run this 10K,

34:10.396 --> 34:12.600
but on the advice
of friends and colleagues,

34:12.633 --> 34:15.037
I've decided
to let you be the judge.

34:15.072 --> 34:17.076
-Cassie?
-Yes, she was quite insistent

34:17.109 --> 34:19.414
I have a thorough
exam before the race.

34:19.447 --> 34:20.749
(SIGHS)

34:22.387 --> 34:23.722
(LAUGHS AND SNORTS)

34:25.726 --> 34:28.265
Well, I have to say,
I can't recommend
that you run.

34:28.965 --> 34:31.171
Really? What? Wait, really?

34:31.205 --> 34:32.440
I'm feeling some scar tissue.

34:33.542 --> 34:34.744
You may
have plantar fasciitis.

34:35.279 --> 34:36.415
Oh, dear!

34:36.448 --> 34:37.550
Oh, it's nothing serious,

34:37.583 --> 34:39.854
but any pressure to your foot
can cause a flare up.

34:41.157 --> 34:43.595
Just to play it safe, I think
you should sit this one out.

34:44.364 --> 34:46.635
Well, if you insist!

34:47.770 --> 34:48.972
Uh, I do.

34:50.376 --> 34:54.284
As long as you know
that I could've finished
the race had I run.

34:54.317 --> 34:55.353
Oh, I do.

34:55.386 --> 34:57.088
Well, then I will follow
doctor's orders.

34:57.122 --> 34:59.661
-Thank you.
-No, thank you!

35:00.363 --> 35:02.166
(CLEARS THROAT)

35:02.199 --> 35:03.869
JOHN: That's my
daughter on the right.

35:05.439 --> 35:07.977
And that's Ashley
standing next to her.

35:08.010 --> 35:10.283
Well, her real
name's Heather.

35:10.316 --> 35:12.487
And, uh, she is
my granddaughter.

35:12.520 --> 35:13.555
(CHUCKLES)

35:13.589 --> 35:15.593
And I can see
the family resemblance.

35:17.930 --> 35:19.667
So you knew?

35:19.701 --> 35:22.273
That you
and Heather connected,
yes, I had a feeling.

35:23.875 --> 35:25.346
But she doesn't know you.

35:26.281 --> 35:27.683
No, no.

35:29.186 --> 35:30.456
No, she doesn't.

35:30.489 --> 35:32.460
Well, I think she'd wanna
know she has a grandfather.

35:34.431 --> 35:35.599
Not this grandfather.

35:42.279 --> 35:43.349
Hello, Ashley.

35:51.164 --> 35:52.600
Hello.

35:58.043 --> 35:59.079
Hello, Heather.

36:00.516 --> 36:02.018
It's Ashley.

36:03.622 --> 36:05.225
My name is Ashley.

36:09.065 --> 36:10.067
(SIGHING)

36:23.160 --> 36:24.997
ASHLEY: (WHISPERING)
It's me.

36:26.901 --> 36:29.474
I know, but I can't
do this anymore.

36:31.645 --> 36:34.584
I know you followed me here,
I can see you in town.

36:36.254 --> 36:39.861
I know I said I would,
but I don't think I can.

36:39.894 --> 36:43.401
Of course I'm scared.
Why do you think I ran?

36:43.435 --> 36:46.274
You can't protect me
forever, and
even if you could,

36:46.307 --> 36:48.545
I'm not ready to give up
my whole life. I...

36:50.315 --> 36:52.118
You have to find someone else.

36:52.151 --> 36:53.689
Sorry, I'm out.

36:57.863 --> 36:59.233
(DOOR OPENS)

37:00.101 --> 37:01.337
(DOOR CLOSES)

37:13.160 --> 37:14.764
What did you do?

37:14.797 --> 37:16.133
Excuse me?

37:16.166 --> 37:18.972
My room, my stuff,
my phone?

37:19.005 --> 37:21.143
I had a sudden attack
of Feng Shui.

37:21.176 --> 37:23.715
Feng Shui your own things.
Give me my stuff back.

37:25.352 --> 37:27.088
-Your stuff?
-Yeah!

37:27.121 --> 37:29.159
-Did you pay for it?
-What?

37:29.192 --> 37:31.765
See, what's yours
is actually mine.

37:31.798 --> 37:34.336
(SIGHS) Okay, enough.
I'm sorry. Sorry I lied...

37:34.370 --> 37:37.910
No, not nearly enough,
but I'm getting there.

37:37.943 --> 37:40.916
You break the rules,
do something bad, we talk.

37:40.949 --> 37:42.419
You don't really listen,

37:42.452 --> 37:45.826
and then we repeat
the whole process
over and over again.

37:45.859 --> 37:47.930
You're not making any sense.

37:47.963 --> 37:51.404
You and I need
a game changer.

37:51.437 --> 37:52.640
What game?

37:52.673 --> 37:54.276
The game that
you've been winning

37:54.310 --> 37:56.380
and I've been losing
ever since the divorce.

37:56.414 --> 37:58.250
Just give me my stuff.

37:58.284 --> 37:59.687
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

38:01.591 --> 38:05.766
I'm gonna run the 10K
and I was going to ask you
to run it with me.

38:05.799 --> 38:08.270
But I know you haven't run
since your mom
and I got divorced.

38:08.304 --> 38:09.974
And just like
not running anymore,

38:10.007 --> 38:13.448
every destructive thing you do
and continue to do

38:13.481 --> 38:15.251
doesn't hurt your mom

38:15.284 --> 38:16.554
or me.

38:17.121 --> 38:18.257
It only hurts you.

38:25.538 --> 38:27.141
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

38:28.511 --> 38:31.885
You and I don't have
what I would call
"a solid relationship."

38:33.789 --> 38:35.592
Last night, I couldn't sleep,

38:35.625 --> 38:38.398
because I thought
if I came down on you
one more time,

38:38.832 --> 38:40.402
that'd be it.

38:41.971 --> 38:43.875
No relationship at all.

38:46.179 --> 38:49.185
I was afraid of losing
what little we have.

38:54.062 --> 38:55.966
But I'm not afraid anymore.

38:57.135 --> 38:58.671
You've been using
that fear against me,

38:58.705 --> 39:01.845
you've been using
a lot of things against me.

39:02.847 --> 39:04.616
And that stops today.

39:05.719 --> 39:07.155
Right now.

39:27.797 --> 39:29.767
-Hi.
-Evening.

39:29.801 --> 39:31.470
I'd like to speak
with your chief.

39:31.504 --> 39:33.408
Oh, he's left. Everyone has.

39:38.684 --> 39:41.390
-You're a U.S. Attorney.
-I am.

39:41.424 --> 39:43.895
Perhaps, you could
help me with a witness

39:43.929 --> 39:45.565
for a case that
I'm prosecuting.

39:47.436 --> 39:48.939
BRANDON: Ashley?

39:48.972 --> 39:50.475
Yeah, she's staying
at Grey House.

39:50.508 --> 39:51.510
I know.

39:52.111 --> 39:53.648
She's a witness?

39:53.681 --> 39:57.055
She was until
she skipped town
a few days back.

39:58.290 --> 40:00.127
Unfortunately,
I'm running out of time.

40:00.161 --> 40:01.163
For what?

40:02.065 --> 40:04.035
Putting her fiance
behind bars.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.939
-Her fiance?
-Mmm-hmm.

40:07.141 --> 40:08.544
(SIGHS)

40:14.723 --> 40:15.959
Hi, Ashley.

40:17.662 --> 40:18.764
It's Heather.

40:21.403 --> 40:23.674
-I have to go.
-Oh, you need to stop running.

40:23.708 --> 40:24.977
I can't!

40:25.011 --> 40:27.415
I don't want to cause you
or your family any trouble.

40:27.449 --> 40:29.620
-I can help you.
-No one can!

40:30.956 --> 40:32.492
I did this to myself.

40:34.630 --> 40:37.636
Thanks for everything.

40:39.440 --> 40:42.311
Sorry for lying.

40:47.155 --> 40:48.524
Heather.

40:50.762 --> 40:52.398
Heather, wait!

40:53.668 --> 40:54.703
Where will you go?

40:57.876 --> 40:59.546
There's a guy who works
for the government.

40:59.580 --> 41:01.316
He'll be looking for me.

41:01.349 --> 41:02.953
The less you know,
the less you can tell.

41:03.888 --> 41:05.658
It's better for both of us.

41:05.692 --> 41:07.161
Leaving is a mistake.

41:08.397 --> 41:10.401
I've made a lot of those.
