00:15.465 --> 00:16.625
Alan?

00:20.937 --> 00:22.131
Alan, what are you doing?

00:22.238 --> 00:24.331
There are dust bunnies everywhere!

00:28.478 --> 00:30.343
So you're vacuuming dust bunnies?

00:30.447 --> 00:33.348
No. Their poop. It's all over the place.

00:37.153 --> 00:38.780
Are you sleepwalking?

00:38.855 --> 00:41.323
You're stepping in it! Don't step in it!

00:45.795 --> 00:49.856
Alan, why don't we leave
the dust bunny poop until morning?

00:54.170 --> 00:55.660
- Click.
- Hey!

00:59.776 --> 01:04.269
Come on. Let's get you tucked in,
you crazy son of a bitch.

01:16.292 --> 01:19.386
- What?
- You know.

01:23.533 --> 01:26.400
Okay, that's it, into bed. Nighty-night.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.971
If you feel the need to get up
and clean something,

01:29.038 --> 01:31.131
maybe you can wax my car.

01:34.144 --> 01:36.044
For God's sake, Rose!

01:36.579 --> 01:38.877
Isn't there enough poop
on the carpet tonight?

01:39.482 --> 01:40.847
What are you doing here?

01:40.917 --> 01:43.818
I'm sorry. I saw your lights come on
and I was worried.

01:43.887 --> 01:47.323
Why were you looking at my house
at 3:00 in the morning?

01:48.258 --> 01:51.193
Haven't you heard
of the Neighborhood Watch?

01:51.261 --> 01:54.253
- We don't have a Neighborhood Watch.
- Well, not yet.

01:54.364 --> 01:57.663
If we did, I surely couldn't stroll in here
like I just did.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.529
Yeah.

02:01.437 --> 02:04.873
- So, what's going on?
- Nothing. Alan was sleepwalking.

02:05.441 --> 02:09.036
- At least, I hope that was sleepwalking.
- Sure.

02:09.245 --> 02:11.509
My parents used to put
a football helmet on me

02:11.581 --> 02:14.209
- and strap me in bed.
- You were a sleepwalker?

02:14.517 --> 02:15.643
No.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.352
- Good night, Rose.
- Good night, Charlie.

02:21.825 --> 02:24.350
Thank you, I had a wonderful time.

02:31.734 --> 02:36.694
If crazy ever becomes an Olympic event,
I get the first two legs of the relay.

02:43.546 --> 02:46.777
- What?
- Nothing.

02:48.885 --> 02:51.285
Man, I'm living in a loony bin.

03:00.797 --> 03:04.062
Judith, I don't care what
all the other divorced parents are doing.

03:04.133 --> 03:07.899
I don't think Jake needs
to keep seeing the psychologist.

03:08.137 --> 03:10.128
No, I am not in denial.

03:13.343 --> 03:16.574
Judith, denying you're in denial
is not denial.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.606
Okay, this is how it's going to be.

03:20.683 --> 03:23.618
I will have Jake
at the psychologist's office at 11:00.

03:23.686 --> 03:25.313
You're welcome.

03:25.421 --> 03:26.513
Damn it!

03:27.090 --> 03:29.081
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

03:29.192 --> 03:30.318
Were you talking to Mom?

03:30.426 --> 03:32.656
Yes, but I hung up
before I said the bad stuff.

03:32.762 --> 03:35.026
Yeah, she does the same thing with you.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.769
- Hey.
- Morning. Why is the vacuum cleaner out?

03:44.807 --> 03:47.708
Because we were ankle deep
in bunny poop.

03:50.613 --> 03:54.174
- Were you drinking last night?
- Yes, but that's not the point.

03:55.351 --> 03:59.151
- You were sleepwalking.
- Really? I have no memory of being up.

03:59.222 --> 04:02.851
Good for you, because I have no memory
of being asleep.

04:03.226 --> 04:05.956
I'm sorry, I haven't done that
since I was a kid.

04:06.229 --> 04:07.992
Yeah, well, if you're gonna regress,

04:08.064 --> 04:10.897
let me know,
so I can stock up on rubber sheets.

04:11.567 --> 04:13.865
Okay, that was uncalled for!

04:14.137 --> 04:17.504
You want to go to the bowling alley
and play some air hockey today?

04:17.572 --> 04:21.236
Sure, but you still owe me
like $12,000 from last time.

04:21.978 --> 04:24.071
What are you gonna do, break my thumbs?

04:24.180 --> 04:26.239
Wouldn't hurt your game.

04:27.216 --> 04:29.810
Remember, we have Jake's session first.

04:29.886 --> 04:32.855
Man! I thought you didn't want him
to go back to that quack.

04:32.922 --> 04:35.322
I didn't, but Judith and I talked,

04:35.391 --> 04:38.758
and we decided that what I want
makes no difference whatsoever.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.221
Man, you are so whipped.

04:42.332 --> 04:45.392
I am not whipped!
I'm just trying to keep everybody happy.

04:45.501 --> 04:49.562
- Meow. Fit-choo!
- I am not "meow-fitchooed. "

04:50.740 --> 04:54.176
You're right. It's been a long time
since you got any meow.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.246
Are we getting a cat?

05:03.119 --> 05:06.088
You know, this is a waste of time.
Jake's a normal kid.

05:06.189 --> 05:09.886
But it's not gonna hurt to have someone
outside the family he can talk to.

05:09.959 --> 05:13.417
Please. He's just sitting in there
making stuff up.

05:14.630 --> 05:17.121
- What?
- Well, not really making it up.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.929
He and I work out his schtick beforehand.

05:23.072 --> 05:26.098
Today he's telling her
he sees dead people.

05:28.778 --> 05:31.474
Charlie, I am paying this woman
a lot of money.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.776
Bet you feel pretty stupid, huh?

05:35.051 --> 05:36.211
What do you want me to do?

05:36.285 --> 05:39.254
Judith is insisting
he comes here once a week.

05:39.322 --> 05:43.918
Okay, look, nobody likes divorce,
but there are certain advantages.

05:44.227 --> 05:45.592
One of the more popular ones

05:45.661 --> 05:48.721
is you get to tell your ex-wife
to bite the big one!

05:49.565 --> 05:52.363
- Or whatever you got left.
- Yeah.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.533
That'll help.
Look, it's just an hour out of our day.

05:55.638 --> 05:58.937
Which could've been spent on air hockey
and bowling alley martinis.

05:59.008 --> 06:02.136
It's a small price to pay
to avoid aggravating Judith.

06:02.211 --> 06:04.645
- Okay. I understand.
- Thank you.

06:05.314 --> 06:07.043
You're a big girl.

06:07.850 --> 06:11.547
Okay. Are there any out here?

06:17.026 --> 06:19.119
- No.
- Good.

06:19.896 --> 06:22.160
We'll see you next Saturday.

06:25.134 --> 06:27.898
Doctor, you should know,
he doesn't really see dead people.

06:28.004 --> 06:30.029
Of course not. He's just trying to resolve

06:30.139 --> 06:32.073
emotional issues
through visualized fantasy.

06:32.175 --> 06:34.040
Do you have my check?

06:36.079 --> 06:39.310
Dad, how come we never got spare ribs
when we were at Mom's house?

06:39.382 --> 06:42.146
Because your mom thinks
they're too fatty.

06:42.218 --> 06:43.651
Fit-choo!

06:45.721 --> 06:49.350
- Is that really necessary?
- Hey, if the fit-choo fits.

06:50.593 --> 06:51.924
Fit-choo!

06:55.598 --> 06:57.156
Are you happy?

06:57.400 --> 07:00.597
- Come on, he doesn't know what it means.
- Fine.

07:01.003 --> 07:03.437
Anybody see the pancakes
for the moo-shu chicken?

07:03.840 --> 07:07.367
No, looks like they forgot them.
Just eat it with a fork.

07:07.610 --> 07:09.237
You don't eat moo-shu with a fork.

07:09.345 --> 07:12.337
You eat moo-shu with a pancake,
like a little Chinese taco.

07:12.715 --> 07:16.207
- Okay, all right. You want a taco shell?
- No, I don't want a taco shell!

07:16.285 --> 07:21.120
I want a pancake for my moo-shu.
I ordered pancakes. I paid for pancakes.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.716
Where the hell are my pancakes?

07:23.793 --> 07:27.229
- Alan, chill.
- I will not chill. I want what I ordered.

07:27.296 --> 07:30.424
And for once in my life,
I will get what was promised me!

07:30.533 --> 07:31.932
Fit-choo.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.302
See? Not a clue.

07:40.376 --> 07:43.470
I am gonna call that restaurant
and give them a piece of my mind.

07:43.579 --> 07:46.412
That's smart. Scream at the people
who handle your food.

07:47.316 --> 07:49.045
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

07:49.118 --> 07:51.484
Maybe a little tired.
Just been working pretty hard.

07:51.587 --> 07:53.987
You know, my second grade teacher,
Miss Spulvaney?

07:54.090 --> 07:56.422
One time she got mad
'cause there was no chalk,

07:56.492 --> 07:59.928
and they found her in the cafeteria
hiding under a lunch table.

07:59.996 --> 08:02.658
- No kidding.
- Yeah, she went berserk.

08:05.401 --> 08:07.801
That's how we got Miss McKinnon.

08:22.318 --> 08:25.310
- Hi.
- Rose?

08:26.322 --> 08:28.620
How do you keep getting in the house?

08:29.358 --> 08:31.690
Charlie, aren't we past that?

08:32.495 --> 08:35.828
I thought you'd like to know
that your brother is sleepwalking again.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.991
And you had to get in bed with me
to tell me that?

08:39.335 --> 08:42.462
No, silly. I was already in bed with you.

08:44.473 --> 08:47.442
I just heard him
walking around downstairs.

09:00.556 --> 09:01.750
Alan?

09:03.192 --> 09:06.320
- What are you doing?
- Making a birthday cake.

09:06.429 --> 09:08.397
You and Mom want some?

09:09.565 --> 09:12.728
You handle this, honey,
I'm going back to bed.

09:22.078 --> 09:25.013
- Jake, your grandmother's here.
- Oh, man.

09:25.748 --> 09:28.148
I mean, right here in the room.

09:29.252 --> 09:31.379
Oh, man, Grandma's here!

09:32.688 --> 09:35.179
- I blame you.
- Take a number.

09:37.526 --> 09:39.687
How could we be out of eggs?

09:39.895 --> 09:44.525
"Dr. Linda Freeman, Child Psychologist?"
Who here's seeing a child psychologist?

09:46.435 --> 09:47.663
Jake.

09:48.237 --> 09:52.674
His mom was concerned about, you know,
the impact of the divorce and everything.

09:52.742 --> 09:55.939
- On who?
- On Jake.

09:57.546 --> 10:00.709
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go get some eggs.

10:00.783 --> 10:05.220
Jake, honey. I just want you to know

10:05.521 --> 10:08.786
that seeing a therapist
is no reflection on you.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.858
- Okay.
- It's a reflection on your parents.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.689
Particularly your mother.

10:16.065 --> 10:18.397
I think we're gonna get a cat.

10:19.969 --> 10:23.803
- The queen of darkness is here.
- Thanks for the heads-up.

10:24.373 --> 10:26.637
- Where you going?
- We're out of eggs.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.538
And you have no idea why?

10:29.612 --> 10:32.877
Well, Charlie, I would assume
somebody ate them.

10:35.985 --> 10:38.078
Okay, let's go with that.

10:39.055 --> 10:43.788
And then I tried Freudian analysis,
but with them, you know, it's just sex.

10:45.561 --> 10:49.292
- My doctor has a cow puppet.
- Really?

10:50.266 --> 10:53.997
- M.D. Or PhD?
- C-O-W.

10:56.906 --> 11:00.569
- Hey, Ma. Can I talk to you for a minute?
- I'll be right there.

11:01.077 --> 11:05.446
Now, honey, the cow puppet doesn't need
to know about the time

11:05.514 --> 11:08.381
you saw grandmommy dancing
with the Cuban gentleman

11:08.484 --> 11:11.112
in the Neiman Marcus changing room.

11:12.722 --> 11:14.622
What is it, Charlie?

11:14.724 --> 11:18.717
I need to talk to you about Alan.
He's been acting really strange lately.

11:18.828 --> 11:21.126
And I suppose it's my fault.

11:21.564 --> 11:24.328
No. Well, maybe.

11:26.168 --> 11:28.398
The thing is, he's been sleepwalking,

11:28.504 --> 11:30.529
and I remember him
doing it when he was a kid.

11:30.639 --> 11:33.631
Yes. It was shortly after
your father passed away.

11:33.709 --> 11:37.167
- What'd you do about it?
- Well, nothing really.

11:37.346 --> 11:40.645
It seemed to stop by itself
when he was 13.

11:40.850 --> 11:45.014
Right around the time
he started taking those long showers

11:47.423 --> 11:50.984
and relieving his anxiety
in a more direct way.

11:52.595 --> 11:55.996
Got it. So, sexual release
cured his sleepwalking?

11:56.098 --> 12:00.558
Seemed to. Of course, there was
a brief time when the two overlapped.

12:03.439 --> 12:07.535
I recall an incredibly
awkward bridge game.

12:07.777 --> 12:09.677
Okay, great. Thanks.

12:10.079 --> 12:13.242
I had Seven No Trump
and he just walked in

12:13.349 --> 12:15.613
with this goofy smile on his face.

12:16.352 --> 12:18.912
This is nice. Great idea, Charlie.

12:19.889 --> 12:22.790
I figure you work all week,
you got your kid on the weekends.

12:22.892 --> 12:26.885
I bet you hardly even have the time
to take a nice long soapy shower.

12:28.397 --> 12:32.561
- Yeah, it has been a little hectic.
- Let me ask you something.

12:33.202 --> 12:35.796
When's the last time
you had sex with a girl?

12:36.472 --> 12:39.407
Or a melon? Or anything?

12:39.909 --> 12:43.367
- None of your business...
- That long?

12:45.147 --> 12:47.581
- Why do you care?
- I don't know.

12:47.983 --> 12:52.420
You just have that twitchy look of a guy
who's got one stuck in the chamber.

12:53.155 --> 12:54.952
I'm fine, Charlie.

12:55.458 --> 12:57.153
Yeah, sure, I'd like to meet somebody.

12:57.259 --> 12:59.557
But in the meantime,
I'm living a very full life.

12:59.628 --> 13:03.394
I have no complaints.
This table is really starting to piss me off.

13:03.466 --> 13:04.797
Just let it wobble.

13:04.900 --> 13:07.960
You want beer in your lap?
'Cause I don't want beer on my lap.

13:09.939 --> 13:12.601
Hi, Charlie. Who's your cute friend?

13:15.678 --> 13:18.078
Just get up here, you jackass.

13:21.016 --> 13:23.780
Hi, Charlie. Who's your cute friend?

13:24.353 --> 13:27.151
Hi, Darlene. This is my brother, Alan.

13:27.356 --> 13:29.324
Come, please, join us.

13:30.626 --> 13:33.618
- Hi, Alan. This is my friend, Annette.
- Hi.

13:33.696 --> 13:36.187
- Hello.
- Hey, he is cute.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.831
You are.

13:40.669 --> 13:45.129
You know, Alan, Annette is a seat-filler
for most of the major awards shows.

13:45.441 --> 13:48.877
- Is that so?
- Yeah, it's a big responsibility.

13:49.311 --> 13:52.337
'Cause when a celebrity
gets up to go the bathroom,

13:52.448 --> 13:54.882
they don't want to have
an empty seat on TV.

13:54.984 --> 13:56.383
Understandable.

13:56.485 --> 13:59.648
You know who pees a lot? Jeff Bridges.

14:03.025 --> 14:05.459
What do you say we leave
and go back to our place?

14:05.528 --> 14:08.190
- Okey-dokey.
- Wait, just hold it.

14:08.631 --> 14:12.067
- Everybody, sit down.
- I feel like I'm at work.

14:13.202 --> 14:15.466
- What is going on?
- Nothing.

14:15.538 --> 14:17.836
We met a couple of girls
who took a shine to us.

14:17.907 --> 14:21.070
- Just like that?
- Yes, Alan, just like that.

14:22.177 --> 14:26.307
- God, please tell me you did not pay them.
- Hey, I resent that.

14:27.016 --> 14:29.143
Not all seat-fillers hook.

14:32.388 --> 14:35.687
Well, it was very nice meeting you.
I'm leaving.

14:36.692 --> 14:38.853
Be right back. Keep drinking.

14:39.528 --> 14:41.826
- What is wrong with you?
- Me?

14:41.897 --> 14:43.831
There is nothing wrong with me.
I'm just...

14:43.899 --> 14:46.197
I'm not interested in being set up
with a woman

14:46.268 --> 14:49.101
whose idea of chit-chat
is celebrity pee-pee secrets.

14:49.204 --> 14:51.399
- How about the other one?
- No!

14:51.507 --> 14:54.908
You sure? 'Cause there's no way
you're banging her on your own.

14:55.010 --> 14:58.844
- Why is this so important to you?
- Are you kidding me?

14:58.914 --> 15:02.611
You've been acting nuttier
than rat crap in a pistachio factory.

15:02.851 --> 15:05.615
I figured if I could coax
your Johnson out of retirement,

15:05.721 --> 15:08.383
you'd stop making
invisible birthday cakes.

15:08.457 --> 15:11.949
- What?
- I can't say it more clearly than that, Alan.

15:17.266 --> 15:20.463
Are you happy?

15:23.238 --> 15:27.902
Anyway, I know you only deal with kids,
but I didn't know where else to take him.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.407
This is ridiculous. I don't need to be here.

15:33.482 --> 15:37.612
I gave you a choice.
Take the long shower or talk to the doctor.

15:38.921 --> 15:39.945
Okay.

15:40.055 --> 15:43.718
Well, if I had to guess,
and that's pretty much all I do here,

15:46.061 --> 15:47.619
I would have to say that,

15:47.730 --> 15:50.631
based on his inappropriate outbursts
and sleepwalking,

15:50.733 --> 15:54.430
Alan is struggling with a great deal
of suppressed rage.

15:55.137 --> 15:57.332
Rage? No, I don't think so.

15:58.407 --> 16:01.501
Come on. Your wife threw you
out of your own house,

16:01.610 --> 16:04.010
she still runs your life, you're broke,

16:04.113 --> 16:06.479
and you only get to see your kid
two days a week,

16:06.582 --> 16:09.847
one of which you have to bring him
to this rug rat exorcist.

16:14.323 --> 16:15.790
No offense.

16:17.926 --> 16:19.120
Okay.

16:21.497 --> 16:24.660
Now, Alan, how do you feel
about what Charlie just shared?

16:24.767 --> 16:29.670
I think he's completely off base.
Yes, I get a little frustrated sometimes,

16:30.005 --> 16:34.533
and when Judith doesn't get her own way,
she just keeps coming at me

16:35.377 --> 16:38.141
and coming at me
like a frigging steamroller.

16:38.213 --> 16:42.115
- Crushing my spirit and my self-respect.
- That's very good.

16:42.184 --> 16:45.051
But on the other hand,
she's a very good mom to Jake.

16:45.220 --> 16:49.054
Okay. I'll tell you what. Let's pretend

16:49.825 --> 16:53.226
that Judith is sitting in this chair.

16:54.697 --> 16:56.722
What would you tell her right now?

16:57.366 --> 17:00.631
Boy, I don't know. I feel a little silly
talking to an empty chair.

17:00.703 --> 17:02.728
Fair enough. Charlie, do you mind?

17:02.838 --> 17:05.032
- Do I mind what?
- Thank you.

17:11.079 --> 17:15.517
Now, Alan, tell Judith how you really feel.

17:18.420 --> 17:21.981
Well, Judith,

17:23.492 --> 17:27.258
I know you're working through
some of your own issues,

17:27.429 --> 17:32.526
- sexual and otherwise, and I support that.
- That's telling her, Alan.

17:33.936 --> 17:36.370
Charlie, remember, you're Judith.

17:37.039 --> 17:38.267
Sorry.

17:39.408 --> 17:41.501
That's telling me, Alan.

17:44.847 --> 17:47.247
Is this gonna take much longer?

17:48.050 --> 17:52.111
'Cause I have to get to a massage,
then a tennis lesson that he's paying for.

17:53.388 --> 17:57.586
- Tennis? Since when do you play tennis?
- I told you, but you never listen.

17:58.293 --> 18:01.387
He never listens.
Thank God his brother took him in.

18:02.131 --> 18:05.191
- Okay, I am warning you.
- You're warning me?

18:06.135 --> 18:09.298
Okay, Alan, how are you feeling right now?

18:09.738 --> 18:13.697
- Well, a little angry.
- Really? 'Cause you don't sound angry.

18:13.809 --> 18:15.800
Well, I am.

18:16.111 --> 18:19.137
I just don't see any reason
to make a big spectacle of myself.

18:19.248 --> 18:24.379
Yeah, you'd rather blow off a sure thing
who actually makes a living with her ass.

18:26.155 --> 18:28.919
Meaningless, loveless sex
is not the answer, Charlie.

18:28.991 --> 18:30.959
- Meow, fit-choo!
- Okay.

18:32.928 --> 18:34.555
I am really getting tired of that.

18:34.630 --> 18:38.088
Hey, you know what, Charlie?
I don't much care for that, either.

18:38.834 --> 18:40.961
If you like,
we can schedule another session

18:41.069 --> 18:43.264
to deal with your fear of vaginas.

18:47.009 --> 18:50.604
Now, Alan, the reason I asked you
if you were angry

18:50.679 --> 18:53.239
is because I have yet to see
any genuine expression

18:53.315 --> 18:56.614
of what are undoubtedly
some very powerful feelings.

18:56.685 --> 18:59.745
I'm sorry, but that's just the best I can do.

18:59.822 --> 19:01.790
Okay, well, let's try something else.

19:01.857 --> 19:05.418
This is called a bataca.

19:05.828 --> 19:08.820
It's heavily padded, it can't hurt anyone,

19:08.931 --> 19:12.867
but you can use it
to vent your deep, angry feelings.

19:14.469 --> 19:17.336
You're wasting your time, Doc.
He's too much of a wimp.

19:17.439 --> 19:19.703
Attaboy, Alan! Let it go!

19:20.776 --> 19:23.438
Good!

19:24.313 --> 19:28.807
I'm so mad! I hate you!

19:28.884 --> 19:31.284
- Who do you hate, Alan? Who do you hate?
- Everybody!

19:31.353 --> 19:35.483
- Good! Let it go! Keep going, Alan!
- Wait a minute! Stop!

19:36.191 --> 19:37.385
Should I stop?

19:37.492 --> 19:40.484
Well, it's up to you.
You paid for the full hour, so...

19:43.165 --> 19:46.328
Attaboy. Hit him!

19:49.638 --> 19:52.368
Thank you, Doctor. That was great.
I feel much better.

19:52.474 --> 19:56.501
- Good.
- Yeah. We're all thrilled for you.

19:58.714 --> 20:02.081
And by the way, about the... You know.

20:03.719 --> 20:07.416
I'm not scared of them.
I just have a healthy respect.

20:09.358 --> 20:11.986
Fine. We'll see you both next week.

20:18.200 --> 20:21.328
How long am I gonna have to
keep coming here?

20:49.831 --> 20:51.025
