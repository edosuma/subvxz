WEBVTT

00:02.320 --> 00:04.402
- Get off me!
- Just stop moving!

00:04.560 --> 00:06.528
Alpha Papa 1-2 to Uniform.

00:06.680 --> 00:08.444
We have the Benedetto girl.

00:08.600 --> 00:11.171
- Where's my wife?
- Don't know what you mean.

00:13.400 --> 00:17.291
Sally Ann Spector, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.010
- What?
- Paul Spector.

00:19.160 --> 00:22.289
I'm arresting you
for the unlawful imprisonment of Rose Stagg.

00:22.440 --> 00:25.364
- No sign of Rose Stagg's car?
- No, ma'am.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.363
We need to find that oar-.

00:27.520 --> 00:30.330
I'm asking you to account for
the presence on your phone

00:30.480 --> 00:34.883
of a number of video files
featuring the image of Rose Stagg.

00:35.040 --> 00:39.125
<i>I am loved and nothing that you can do
can take that away.</i>

00:39.280 --> 00:42.124
<i>Do you know that?
Do you know that?</i>

00:42.480 --> 00:45.802
What is your explanation
for those files being found on your phone?

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074

01:01.480 --> 01:03.608
Detective Superintendent Gibson.

01:05.120 --> 01:07.122
Thank you.

01:12.320 --> 01:15.642
- Hey, Ged.
- Seems the car was set on fire deliberately.

01:15.800 --> 01:19.122
- Is it definitely Spector's?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:19.280 --> 01:22.762
It looks like the car exploded
with the stuff scattered far and wide.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.162
- Was it extinguished?
- Burnt itself out.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.971
No human remains apart from some burnt hair.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.771
Most likely from the mannequin in the boot.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.090
We should get this car to the labs.

01:35.240 --> 01:38.369
I need the forensic evidence
and <i>as</i> fast as possible.

01:38.520 --> 01:39.601
Yes, ma'am.

01:39.760 --> 01:42.411
Tell me where the car is on these photographs?

01:47.360 --> 01:49.010
There.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.885
- Have we checked this building yet?
- Not yet, ma'am.

02:03.760 --> 02:13.760
<b><font color=#004f8c>Ripped by mstoll</font></b>

02:24.960 --> 02:27.361
Those look like Rose Stagg's tyres to you?

02:30.520 --> 02:32.522
Could well be.

02:40.840 --> 02:43.571
We should wait for my team to arrive, ma'am.

02:43.720 --> 02:45.324
She could be in there.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.490
New padlock.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.368
Fetch the bolt cutters-.

06:21.680 --> 06:25.685
<i>I feel sorry for you. I really do.</i>

06:27.080 --> 06:28.081
Ma'am?

06:28.240 --> 06:32.006
<i>You must have had a terrible childhood
to be able to do this to me.</i>

06:32.800 --> 06:34.290
<i>I feel sorry for you.</i>

06:38.080 --> 06:40.082
No-one here.

07:01.480 --> 07:02.970
<i>Establish a cordon.</i>

07:03.120 --> 07:05.361
Protect the scene.

07:05.520 --> 07:09.127
Get the photographers in first...then the CSIs.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.361
The whole area will need to be searched.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.242
We might need protective tents.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.323
You think she was in here?

07:18.480 --> 07:20.562
<i>I know she was.</i>

07:21.720 --> 07:23.848
The question is, where is she now?

08:34.640 --> 08:36.482
- Hello?
<i>- Jimmy?</i>

08:37.159 --> 08:38.525
Yeah?

08:38.679 --> 08:39.919
<i>It's me.</i>

08:40.080 --> 08:41.889
<i>I think I found your missus.</i>

08:42.039 --> 08:44.805
- Where?
<i>- On the Esplanade in Bangor.</i>

08:44.960 --> 08:47.964
<i>She just went into one of the houses. Hold on.</i>

08:48.120 --> 08:51.044
<i>It's number 92. If it wasn't her...</i>

09:06.840 --> 09:09.241
The Benedetto girl
is still refusing to see her mother.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.528
An Appropriate Adult should be here by nine.

09:11.680 --> 09:15.401
She's been advised that she is entitled
to legal advice but has declined to obtain it.

09:15.560 --> 09:19.087
She's still a juvenile, so we need to keep
the period of detention to a minimum.

09:19.240 --> 09:20.765
Oh, I know.

09:20.920 --> 09:23.161
We're bringing Sally Ann Spector up
to resume her interview.

09:23.320 --> 09:26.608
- Good.
- Also, Tom Stagg is here to see you, ma'am.

09:30.480 --> 09:33.086
<i>Later today, an announcement
is going to be made</i>

09:33.240 --> 09:36.449
to say that a man has been arrested
and is being held in custody

09:36.600 --> 09:41.208
on suspicion of the abduction
and unlawful imprisonment of Rose.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.569
That same man has also been arrested
for the murder of Joe Brawley

09:44.720 --> 09:47.803
and the serious sexual assault
on his sister, Annie.

09:48.720 --> 09:53.009
We also believe that he's responsible
for a number of other recent murders.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.322
So...

09:59.920 --> 10:03.367
...really you're telling...
you're telling me Rose is...Rose is dead?

10:03.520 --> 10:05.921
No, I'm not saying that at all.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.764
Not at all.

10:11.080 --> 10:13.811
What's his name? ls it Peter?

10:13.960 --> 10:17.442
I can't tell you that until charges are brought.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.566
Has he given any information about Rose?

10:25.840 --> 10:27.842
Or where she might be or...

10:28.600 --> 10:32.207
...or...what's he...what's he done with her?

10:32.360 --> 10:34.249
No.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.928
But we will keep questioning him.

10:40.800 --> 10:44.486
I saw her, the wife, Sally Ann,
being taken away in a car.

10:44.640 --> 10:47.041
- When was this?
- Yesterday afternoon.

10:48.040 --> 10:51.601
- How are you spelling that surname?
- I don't know, Spector.

10:51.760 --> 10:54.331
I don't know how you spell it.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.807
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- It's Ned.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.611
- Who've you got in custody at the moment?
<i>- Why?</i>

11:00.760 --> 11:03.525
- It's just a story I'm working on.
- Do you have any ideas?

11:03.680 --> 11:06.331
I'm thinking...Sally Ann Spector.

11:07.240 --> 11:09.891
- Go on.
- Paul Spector.

11:10.680 --> 11:12.045
That's right.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.567
<i>Is there much excitement
surrounding that arrest?</i>

11:15.240 --> 11:17.971
<i>- Paul Spector?
- Very much so.</i>

11:24.560 --> 11:25.721
Jimmy?

11:26.680 --> 11:29.365
What are you doing here, man?
There's police everywhere.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.124
What's happening?

11:31.280 --> 11:34.250
There have been arrests.
They're searching that house.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.965
Good.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.929
Good?

11:39.760 --> 11:41.762
You know him?

11:42.480 --> 11:44.164
He did this.

11:44.840 --> 11:46.330
When?

11:47.520 --> 11:50.091
- Jimmy, I need to get that story from you.
- I need your car.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.242
- What?
- You heard me.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.804
Jimmy, please.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.964
Jimmy, not my phone.
My whole life's in that phone.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.089
Ma'am.

12:17.240 --> 12:19.242
We have the downloads from Katie's phone.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.402
There's something you should see.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.481
<i>What are you wearing?</i>

12:27.280 --> 12:29.282
<i>Nothing.</i>

12:32.920 --> 12:34.445
<i>Prove it.</i>

12:49.360 --> 12:51.522
You wanted to see me?

12:52.320 --> 12:55.403
I thought that Katie's diaries
were a complete fabrication,

12:55.560 --> 13:01.408
with...alibis for Spector and...
detailed sexual encounters...

13:03.080 --> 13:06.050
A schoolgirl fantasy.

13:06.200 --> 13:09.010
Then this shows upon her phone.

13:26.480 --> 13:28.608
I'd like you to lead on the interview with her.

13:32.240 --> 13:37.201
She's a juvenile. If sex is the issue,
would it not be more appropriate

13:37.360 --> 13:40.011
if she spoke to a person of the same gender?

13:41.720 --> 13:44.041
Yes, probably.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.690
Also easier for her.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.923
Which is why I want you to go in first.

13:49.560 --> 13:53.246
Whatever she says...just keep listening.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.646
Give her your undivided attention.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.647
<i>She's obsessed with Spector.</i>

14:05.400 --> 14:08.961
Let's see how she deals with somebody
of a similar age...

14:10.640 --> 14:12.210
..similar looks.

14:23.240 --> 14:26.608
You see that light that's just come on?

14:27.360 --> 14:28.407
Yes.

14:28.560 --> 14:32.007
That's to indicate
the interviews being monitored.

14:32.160 --> 14:33.730
OK.

14:35.120 --> 14:39.091
Tell me...how you first
came to meet Paul Spector.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.448
I was 14.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.602
My mother knew Sally Ann.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.203
<i>I started baby-sitting for them.</i>

14:48.240 --> 14:50.322
<i>How did the relationship develop?</i>

14:51.200 --> 14:54.602
<i>- You've read my diary?
- Yes, I have read your diary.</i>

14:54.760 --> 14:56.524
<i>It's all in there.</i>

14:57.320 --> 15:00.210
Tell me now, Katie, in your own words.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.522
I want to hear it from you.

15:07.280 --> 15:10.170
Most nights when I baby-sat,
Paul would walk me home.

15:10.320 --> 15:15.008
<i>We'd walk for ages,
just talking about music and poetry.</i>

15:17.160 --> 15:19.322
<i>He's read so many books.</i>

15:20.120 --> 15:22.600
<i>He knows so much about art and literature.</i>

15:24.960 --> 15:27.247
I write and record songs.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.528
We started talking about music.

15:29.680 --> 15:32.047
He listens mainly to blues music.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.528
I wrote a song for him.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.680
I played it to him one night in the study.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.608
That was the first time we kissed-.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.010
It's in the diary.

15:46.160 --> 15:50.370
It was a gentle kiss at first...
just lips touching softly.

15:51.880 --> 15:54.201
But then it became more passionate.

15:55.520 --> 15:58.808
Sally Ann was downstairs
so we had to be careful, but...

15:59.520 --> 16:01.443
..he opened my shirt...

16:02.360 --> 16:04.283
..kissed my breasts...

16:05.520 --> 16:07.648
..licked and sucked my nipples.

16:09.280 --> 16:12.170
<i>I put my hand on the outside of his trousers...</i>

16:13.000 --> 16:15.128
<i>..felt how big he was.</i>

16:15.800 --> 16:17.882
<i>He was getting hard.</i>

16:19.080 --> 16:21.811
<i>And that was as far as it went that first time.</i>

16:23.240 --> 16:26.483
<i>We waited a few minutes
and wenk back downstairs.</i>

16:26.640 --> 16:28.529
Ma'am, there's more.

16:28.680 --> 16:30.842
<i>And this was when you were 14?</i>

16:34.560 --> 16:35.800
Yes.

16:35.960 --> 16:40.329
You know Paul Spector can go to prison,
for the things you're saying?

16:40.480 --> 16:42.084
We love each other.

16:42.760 --> 16:45.604
- You love each other?
- Completely.

16:46.880 --> 16:53.161
A trawl through Dolan's computer has turned up
thousands of recordings made in his hotel.

16:54.360 --> 17:00.242
The whole place seems set up to allow him
to spy on his guests - including Spector.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.642
He tied her up, then he left her.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.289
This is her getting free.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.442
Oh...

17:23.760 --> 17:25.046
When is this?

17:25.200 --> 17:29.489
The same night you received the call
from Rose Stagg's phone.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.121
<i>Why did you break into the Spector home?</i>

17:38.280 --> 17:40.601
I wanted to feel close to him.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.762
Be near his things.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.047
Why did you take this picture?

17:50.560 --> 17:52.164
For fun.

17:52.760 --> 17:54.649
Why are you wearing that T-shirt?

17:54.800 --> 17:56.609
Also for fun.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.922
That's the E-flt of the killer.

17:59.840 --> 18:00.921
Yzes.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.686
- Did you have the T-shirt made yourself?
- Yes.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.604
Why?

18:06.200 --> 18:08.601
Because it looks a bit like Paul.

18:09.440 --> 18:12.205
Because...it is Paul.

18:12.360 --> 18:13.885
No.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.008
It just looks a bit like him.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.889
It's a joke.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.961
Why were you in Spector's hotel room?

18:25.960 --> 18:28.361
I was just waiting for him.
Waiting for him to come back.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.488
- Did he ask you to go there?
- Yes.

18:30.640 --> 18:34.008
- Why?
- So we could go to bed together.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.489
What were you burning in the sink?

18:38.480 --> 18:40.528
Nothing, really, I was bored.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.444
I was just burning things.

18:43.200 --> 18:44.770
Things?

18:44.920 --> 18:46.570
Yes.

18:47.480 --> 18:50.131
Did he ask you to destroy evidence?

18:52.040 --> 18:54.042
Evidence of what?

19:06.640 --> 19:09.564
There are some additional tapes
you should see.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.848
It's all more complex than I thought.

19:13.480 --> 19:16.563
Did your husband
ever give you any gifts of jewellery?

19:17.720 --> 19:20.326
Over the years...yes, of course.

19:21.880 --> 19:26.488
Any pieces that you didn't particularly like,
but that he encouraged you to wear?

19:28.200 --> 19:30.202
I don’t think so.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.048
What are you thinking?

19:35.600 --> 19:37.887
He did give Olivia a necklace.

19:39.400 --> 19:42.961
My mother questioned
whether it was appropriate for a child.

19:44.440 --> 19:46.442
Then it just disappeared.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.402
Can you describe it for me?

19:50.920 --> 19:53.400
Large medallion kind of thing.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.770
Red, I think.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.082
Is this the necklace?

20:08.920 --> 20:10.763
Yes, I think so.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.289
Who is that?

20:15.160 --> 20:17.640
That is one of the murder victims, Sally.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.122
Sarah Kay.

20:24.960 --> 20:29.170
You asked if your husband was arrested
for having sex with a minor.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.042
He was not.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.445
He was arrested initially

20:34.600 --> 20:37.683
for the abduction and false imprisonment
of Rose Stagg.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.929
He was subsequently further arrested

20:41.080 --> 20:45.722
for a serious sexual assault...
and the murder of Joseph Brawley.

20:51.120 --> 20:53.202
I'm going to show you a drawing...

20:56.000 --> 20:59.846
...marked "Exhibit GM2".

21:02.840 --> 21:05.366
Can you tell me if you recognise it?

21:05.520 --> 21:08.922
I'm sorry but the charges
being faced by my client's husband

21:09.080 --> 21:11.003
should have been disclosed at the start...

21:11.160 --> 21:13.606
Your client has admitted to
perverting the course of justice.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.569
She has agreed to cooperate with us in full.

21:15.720 --> 21:19.202
How is your intervention in this interview
helping her?

21:20.160 --> 21:22.401
- I'm bleeding.
- What?

21:23.240 --> 21:25.242
I'm bleeding.

21:43.680 --> 21:45.842
<i>We need to get him to talk.</i>

21:47.240 --> 21:50.005
Just present the evidence, nothing more.

21:50.160 --> 21:53.130
Make him realise that his silence is futile,

21:53.280 --> 21:55.886
the evidence overwhelmingly proves complicity.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.929
Yes, ma'am.

21:58.080 --> 22:04.326
If he speaks, ask him open questions
and just keep listening.

22:06.160 --> 22:08.208
Yes, ma'am.

22:31.800 --> 22:35.168
This is the continuation
of an interview with Paul Spector.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.607
The time is 10:17.

22:38.280 --> 22:40.965
I must remind you
that you're still under caution.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.441
I am Detective Constable Gail McNally.

22:43.600 --> 22:46.843
Also present
is Detective Constable David Garvin.

22:50.400 --> 22:54.325
<i>Human scent dogs tracked the killer from
the place where Joe Brawley was murdered</i>

22:54.480 --> 22:57.165
<i>out along the Airport Road to Conn's Water.</i>

22:57.320 --> 23:01.006
<i>That route, together with Conn's Water
and sections of the Musgrave Channel,</i>

23:01.160 --> 23:03.242
have been thoroughly checked.

23:05.800 --> 23:09.407
I'd like you to account for
the presence of your fingerprints

23:09.560 --> 23:12.450
found on a pair of decorating shears
retrieved from the water

23:12.600 --> 23:16.047
that we believe were used
in the commission of the offence -

23:16.200 --> 23:18.282
namely the murder of Joe Brawley.

23:25.560 --> 23:28.803
We have the scissors here
marked "Exhibit GG12“.

23:32.760 --> 23:35.809
Traces of blood found on the scissors
were tested

23:35.960 --> 23:38.930
and found to be a good match
to that of Joe Brawley.

23:40.880 --> 23:44.248
I believe your fingerprints
and traces of Joe's blood

23:44.400 --> 23:47.847
were found on these scissors because...

23:56.400 --> 24:00.849
Sending in someone who looks vaguely like
Annie Brawley is pretty feeble, Stella.

24:03.080 --> 24:05.128
<i>You can do better than that, surely?</i>

24:09.680 --> 24:14.288
Once again...I'm asking you to account for
the presence of your fingerprints

24:14.440 --> 24:17.887
on these scissors, Exhibit GG12.

24:21.880 --> 24:26.920
<i>It seems you've witnessed Paul Spector's
aberrant sexuality...</i>

24:28.440 --> 24:30.329
..at first hand.

24:31.040 --> 24:33.407
Where did you get that?

24:40.800 --> 24:43.770
You obviously know he's the killer,

24:47.040 --> 24:51.568
so...why continue to insist
he was with you on these dates...

24:52.400 --> 24:54.402
..when he was only with you on this date...

24:54.560 --> 24:56.642
the night Joe Brawley was killed...

24:56.800 --> 24:59.246
and then only after he'd fled the scene?

25:00.440 --> 25:03.125
Only someone with a narrow mind
would call that aberrant.

25:03.280 --> 25:06.762
Katie, there's a great deal of evidence already

25:06.920 --> 25:09.924
to tie Paul Spector to the crimes
of which he stands accused.

25:10.080 --> 25:12.447
Your lies are futile.

25:12.600 --> 25:14.841
Why ruin your life?

25:16.000 --> 25:19.322
Because I was asleep before I met him
and now I'm awake.

25:20.440 --> 25:22.602
Because I see everything with new eyes now.

25:22.760 --> 25:25.331
We are going to press charges, Katie.

25:26.600 --> 25:31.561
You will go to jail for what you're doing -
aiding and abetting a murderer.

25:34.360 --> 25:41.209
You're 16. It's right you kick against authority,
your mother...me.

25:42.760 --> 25:46.651
But there are other ways
of expressing your dissatisfaction.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.488
I've heard your songs.

25:50.640 --> 25:52.529
You're very talented.

25:54.080 --> 25:56.765
If you wanted to pursue music in later life,

25:56.920 --> 26:01.960
a criminal record could slop you from travelling -
to the US, for example.

26:02.120 --> 26:05.249
Many other professions would be closed to you.

26:08.440 --> 26:10.442
You're not listening.

26:11.360 --> 26:12.930
I love him.

26:21.400 --> 26:26.327
I'm not allowed to show you
the crime scene pictures that I have here,

26:26.480 --> 26:30.769
but...you should have some idea
of the kind of man you say you love...

26:33.720 --> 26:35.961
...that you're protecting.

26:43.160 --> 26:46.881
Fiona Gallagher's neck was compressed..

26:48.240 --> 26:52.040
...by the sheer force
with which the ligature was tied...

26:52.800 --> 26:57.931
...to the point that it measured
just over nine inches in circumference.

27:00.480 --> 27:02.482
Imagine that.

27:04.360 --> 27:08.046
The anger and the hatred of women that
would allow someone to do something like that.

27:08.200 --> 27:09.440
I'm finished.

27:09.600 --> 27:12.001
It'll be a matter of routine police work -

27:12.160 --> 27:18.167
checking your phone, your internet records,
CCTV, witness statements -

27:18.320 --> 27:21.005
to destroy the alibis you've created.

27:23.120 --> 27:25.771
All that remains now is for you to be charged.

27:25.920 --> 27:30.130
So...before we finish...the interview,

27:31.000 --> 27:34.163
is there anything that you would like to add,

27:34.320 --> 27:37.483
clarify or...

27:38.800 --> 27:40.962
...explain?

27:42.080 --> 27:44.082
You wouldn't understand.

27:51.840 --> 27:53.842
<i>Sign these tapes.</i>

28:21.360 --> 28:23.328
Liz!

28:23.480 --> 28:24.720
- Liz!
- Jesus.

28:24.880 --> 28:27.247
- I want to see my wife!
- Oh, God.

28:27.400 --> 28:30.290
- Wait there, Liz. Stay there.
- Liz? Where's my wife?

28:30.440 --> 28:32.044
I want to see my wife!

28:32.200 --> 28:33.690
- James,
- Don't let the kids down.

28:33.840 --> 28:36.081
- You're not allowed to be here. Please go.
- Liz...

28:36.240 --> 28:38.083
- Liz.
- Did you hear me? You have to go.

28:38.240 --> 28:40.368
I can't live without you, Please!

28:40.520 --> 28:43.285
- Why won't you see me? Talk to me?
- You know why.

28:43.440 --> 28:45.568
- Just talk to me, please.
- Stay away, Stay back.

28:45.720 --> 28:47.848
- Getaway from her.
- The police are on their way.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.526
- Police? Huh?
- Leave her alone!

28:50.680 --> 28:52.523
She's my wife and she's coming home with me!

28:52.680 --> 28:54.364
- The police are coming.
- Stop it!

28:54.520 --> 28:57.000
You're coming with me. Come on.

28:57.160 --> 28:59.401
- Get your hands off her.
- James, I'm not.

28:59.560 --> 29:02.245
- You're coming with me!
- Lei her go!

29:02.400 --> 29:04.050
Argh!

29:04.200 --> 29:06.168
- Is it him? ls it Spector?
- What?

29:06.320 --> 29:08.846
Is that what this is? ls it Spector?

29:09.000 --> 29:10.809
Huh? ls that what it is?

29:10.960 --> 29:13.406
No! It's not him.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.286
It's you.

29:15.440 --> 29:17.329
I know what happened
when he came to our house.

29:17.480 --> 29:19.687
- Nothing happened!
- Don't lie to me!

29:19.840 --> 29:21.729
Don’t fucking lie to me!

29:24.760 --> 29:26.967
- Get the fuck out!
- Let her go!

29:27.120 --> 29:29.122
OK, OK!

29:33.320 --> 29:35.163
It's true.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.971
I fucked him in Danny's bed.

29:39.120 --> 29:41.566
And he was way better than you!

29:43.000 --> 29:44.684
Is that what you want to hear?

29:46.080 --> 29:48.162
Stop it!

30:01.160 --> 30:03.049
So you don't want me any more?

30:03.200 --> 30:05.248
Huh? Fine.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.004
Oh, God!

30:07.160 --> 30:10.164
I'll kill the lot of you! Then I'll kill myself.

30:10.320 --> 30:13.881
I'll kill all of you and it will all be your fault!

30:14.040 --> 30:17.408
- Please! Please just go!
- The police are coming!

30:17.560 --> 30:22.202
There are children here, children upstairs -
boys the same age as our Daniel!

30:22.360 --> 30:24.089
He was my boy, too!

30:24.240 --> 30:26.561
Go!

30:28.280 --> 30:29.611
Go!

30:55.120 --> 31:00.251
<i>We have found hairs from both Spector and
from Rose Stagg in the abandoned building.</i>

31:00.400 --> 31:04.803
The good news is there is no evidence
to suggest that she was killed there,

31:07.320 --> 31:10.005
Some of the wire from the burnt bras
is a good match

31:10.160 --> 31:13.767
to items we know
to have been in possession of Alice Monroe.

31:16.280 --> 31:20.729
There are sufficient specific references
to dates, times, locations,

31:20.880 --> 31:23.531
in the fragments of the journals
that have survived the fire

31:23.680 --> 31:26.331
to be able to state with some certainty

31:26.480 --> 31:29.404
that the subject being stalked was Sarah Kay.

31:31.160 --> 31:33.401
How much longer do you need
to finish your work?

31:33.560 --> 31:36.962
We'll let you have the results as they come in,
but at least 48 hours.

32:12.560 --> 32:15.803
<i>If I said I was wearing a pink spotty shin,</i>

32:15.960 --> 32:19.123
- would that be the truth or a lie?
- A lie.

32:19.280 --> 32:23.524
<i>And if you told your teacher that something bad
happened to you, but really it didn't happen -</i>

32:23.680 --> 32:25.808
<i>you were making it up -</i>

32:25.960 --> 32:29.203
<i>Would you be telling the truth or a lie?</i>

32:29.960 --> 32:32.406
<i>I'd be telling a lie.</i>

32:33.640 --> 32:35.802
You know you're not in any trouble?

32:35.960 --> 32:38.531
You can leave this room at any time,
go back to Granny,

32:38.680 --> 32:40.330
OK.

32:41.840 --> 32:44.650
I want to show you a drawing, Olivia.

32:47.600 --> 32:49.807
- Did you draw that?
- No.

32:50.720 --> 32:53.121
<i>- Are you sure?
- Yes.</i>

32:55.280 --> 32:57.567
<i>I'm fold your daddy gave you a necklace?</i>

32:57.720 --> 33:00.291
<i>Yes, but I lost it.</i>

33:01.080 --> 33:02.445
<i>What did if look like?</i>

33:02.600 --> 33:04.602
<i>I can't remember.</i>

33:04.760 --> 33:07.889
<i>Did it look like...this?</i>

33:10.400 --> 33:11.731
No.

33:18.080 --> 33:22.608
Did you tell your mummy one time
that you saw a naked lady in your house?

33:22.760 --> 33:25.809
A naked lady in the roof? In the loft?

33:25.960 --> 33:28.167
- Did she tell you I said that?
- Yes.

33:31.560 --> 33:33.483
What do you think you saw?

33:33.640 --> 33:35.847
I can’t tell you. It's a secret.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.809
It's a secret?

33:38.520 --> 33:41.842
OK. Then I won't ask you to tell.

33:43.360 --> 33:44.725
What I do need to know, though,

33:44.880 --> 33:48.123
is what you think might happen
if you did tell me?

33:48.280 --> 33:50.282
I don't know.

33:51.080 --> 33:53.082
Daddy would go to prison?

33:58.880 --> 34:01.042
<i>Thank you, love. You did really well.</i>

34:01.200 --> 34:03.168
<i>I'm gonna take a break there.</i>

34:08.120 --> 34:10.088
I think she saw the mannequin.

34:12.239 --> 34:18.327
There's a er...a shop window mannequin
in the...boot of Spector's burnt-out car.

34:19.719 --> 34:22.041
I think his daughter must have seen it.

34:22.199 --> 34:24.168
<i>OK. Well done.</i>

34:24.320 --> 34:26.322
She just wants to protect him.

34:29.080 --> 34:31.161
She doesn't know what from-.

34:33.400 --> 34:37.485
But all her instincts are telling her
to protect him at all costs.

34:39.840 --> 34:41.967
<i>Do you want to go shopping?</i>

34:59.040 --> 35:00.929
What news on Sally Ann?

35:01.080 --> 35:02.809
Still in hospital.

35:02.960 --> 35:06.009
She had a scan this morning
which confirmed the ultrasound results.

35:06.160 --> 35:08.527
Sac and baby could be clearly seen,
no heartbeat.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.322
Seems it happened while she was in custody.

35:11.480 --> 35:13.562
There'll be an inquiry.

35:16.840 --> 35:19.161
Are we losing much in losing her?

35:19.320 --> 35:21.322
I don’t think so.

35:22.080 --> 35:23.525
As far as Sally Ann Spector knew,

35:23.680 --> 35:28.527
her husband was doing volunteer work for
the suicide help line on the nights in question.

35:28.680 --> 35:31.968
He went running at night a lot
but she never thought that was strange.

35:32.120 --> 35:35.727
It seems he never indulged
his sexual perversities with her...

35:36.880 --> 35:40.123
...and he was only ever
a kind and apparently loving father.

35:40.280 --> 35:42.851
The truth is she knows nothing about him.

35:44.880 --> 35:46.769
So, stupid and incurious but innocent?

35:46.920 --> 35:48.524
Seems that way.

35:49.520 --> 35:52.330
We only have 12 more hours with Spector.

35:55.200 --> 35:57.202
Time to move things on.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.807
I'm Detective Chief Inspector Eastwood.

36:16.960 --> 36:19.281
<i>A vehicle has been recovered</i>

36:19.440 --> 36:23.206
<i>that has provided us
with a great deal of new forensic evidence.</i>

36:24.480 --> 36:29.407
In light of that...
Paul Spector, I am further arresting you

36:29.560 --> 36:34.327
for the murders of Fiona Gallagher,
Alice Monroe and Sarah Kay.

36:36.280 --> 36:38.681
I must remind you
that you are still under caution.

36:38.840 --> 36:41.047
You do not have to say anything.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.771
But it may harm your defence
if you do not mention when questioned

36:43.920 --> 36:46.241
something that you later rely on in court.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.451
Anything you do say may be given in evidence.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.202
Do you understand?

37:02.960 --> 37:04.962
I'll talk to Stella.

37:07.400 --> 37:09.448
No-one else.

37:11.160 --> 37:12.810
<i>Just to her.</i>

37:18.240 --> 37:21.722
<i>Just you, Stella...no-one else.</i>

37:48.400 --> 37:52.564
I know that this investigation
has placed huge demands on you.

37:53.440 --> 37:55.727
Procedural pressures, the long hours,

37:56.680 --> 37:59.604
the emotional pressures
of the crimes themselves.

37:59.760 --> 38:04.129
But is it wise to involve yourself
in the questioning of this man?

38:04.800 --> 38:06.643
He asked for me.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.005
I don't think I have a choice.

38:09.160 --> 38:11.288
It's a departure from normal practice.

38:11.440 --> 38:14.967
- I know.
- For which we will both be held accountable.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.964
As I said, I don't think I have a choice.

38:20.560 --> 38:26.602
He knows things about you, from your diary,
which he can and will use against you.

38:26.760 --> 38:28.762
I know.

38:29.560 --> 38:33.963
I've been face to face with pure evil, Stella.

38:34.120 --> 38:36.168
Jensen.

38:36.320 --> 38:38.891
Spector is out from the same cloth.

38:39.040 --> 38:41.122
He's not a human being, he's a monster.

38:41.280 --> 38:44.363
- Stop, Jim, please. Just stop.
- What?

38:44.520 --> 38:47.126
You can see the world in that way if you want.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.965
You know it makes no sense to me.

38:50.120 --> 38:54.364
Men like Spector are all too human,
too understandable.

38:55.480 --> 38:57.767
He's not a monster. He's just a man.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.082
I'm a man.

39:01.240 --> 39:04.369
- I hope to God I'm nothing like him.
- No, you're not.

39:05.040 --> 39:07.088
But you still came to my hotel room, uninvited,

39:07.240 --> 39:09.925
and mounted
some kind of drunken attack on me.

39:10.080 --> 39:12.970
It wasn't an attack- That's unfair-.

39:13.120 --> 39:15.248
I was...

39:17.160 --> 39:19.481
- I just wanted...
- What did you want?

39:21.080 --> 39:23.731
- I don't know.
- To fuck me?

39:23.880 --> 39:26.121
Nail me, bang me, screw me?

39:28.320 --> 39:30.322
I wouldn't use those words about you.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.764
I was saying no, Jim.

39:32.920 --> 39:34.729
Quite clearly.

39:35.520 --> 39:37.124
You ignored me and carried on.

39:38.520 --> 39:41.763
- It's not the same.
- No, it's not the same.

39:45.400 --> 39:48.244
But you still crossed the line.

39:56.000 --> 40:01.166
Ma'am, the DNA extracted from the lock of hair
found in Spector's possessions...

40:01.320 --> 40:03.368
doesn't match any of the victims.

40:03.520 --> 40:06.967
It is, in fad, a familial match to Spector himself.

40:07.120 --> 40:08.485
His mother, perhaps?

40:08.640 --> 40:12.440
Certainly the photograph
appears 10 be his mother, Mary Garrison-.

41:43.840 --> 41:46.366
When did all this begin for you, do you think?

41:48.760 --> 41:50.762
"All this"?

41:52.760 --> 41:54.888
Take me back to the beginning.

41:55.720 --> 41:58.371
To your childhood, your family.

41:58.520 --> 42:00.522
Why?

42:02.440 --> 42:04.966
You have a lock of hair in your possession.

42:07.360 --> 42:09.408
Is that your mother's?

42:10.920 --> 42:12.922
And a photograph.

42:13.560 --> 42:15.562
Is that of her?

42:20.680 --> 42:24.127
She must have meant a great deal to you
if you've kept them in your possession

42:24.280 --> 42:28.683
through all those years of care,
of juvenile incarceration.

42:30.440 --> 42:33.011
Everyone's mother means a great deal to them.

42:36.160 --> 42:38.766
Not everyone's mother commits suicide.

42:42.160 --> 42:44.561
That must have left you feeling very angry...

42:46.520 --> 42:49.603
“abandoned, alone.

42:54.480 --> 42:58.405
I hadn't expected to hear mother-blaming
from you of all people.

43:00.960 --> 43:03.122
But you were a lonely child?

43:04.120 --> 43:05.963
And you weren't?

43:06.640 --> 43:08.881
All children are lonely.

43:11.840 --> 43:14.047
We've spoken to Father Jensen.

43:15.040 --> 43:17.042
Do you remember Father Jensen?

43:18.440 --> 43:21.569
He remembers you as a child in care.

43:22.960 --> 43:25.281
He has an interesting story to tell.

43:27.600 --> 43:30.251
He says that you threatened him...

43:31.280 --> 43:34.329
...threatened his eyesight
if he laid a finger on you.

43:35.480 --> 43:37.482
He told you that?

43:44.480 --> 43:46.687
He used to take us camping.

43:48.280 --> 43:52.490
Then every night when it came to bed time
there was always the same discovery -

43:53.400 --> 43:55.767
we were one sleeping bag short.

43:57.440 --> 44:01.047
The chosen boy was encouraged
to share with Father Jensen.

44:02.600 --> 44:04.489
I never threatened him or anyone else.

44:04.640 --> 44:06.642
I simply didn't wash.

44:07.600 --> 44:08.806
Ever.

44:08.960 --> 44:11.088
I was repulsive.

44:13.560 --> 44:15.847
That's how I escaped his attentions.

44:17.400 --> 44:20.006
I was never invited to share his sleeping bag.

44:20.720 --> 44:22.961
I was sent away instead.

44:24.800 --> 44:27.371
- To the South?
- Yes.

44:29.960 --> 44:36.161
What age were you when you started
the breaking and entering - the fetish theft?

44:37.920 --> 44:39.763
12, maybe.

44:41.680 --> 44:44.763
And were your fantasies
always sexual in nature?

44:45.920 --> 44:47.968
Aren't everyone's?

44:52.440 --> 44:56.490
When did the sexual impulse
become fused with violence {or you?

44:58.200 --> 45:00.567
You sound a little out of your depth, Stella.

45:02.240 --> 45:04.129
Do I?

45:04.280 --> 45:08.604
I think you're struggling to understand things
that are way outside your experience'

45:11.040 --> 45:13.122
Enlighten me.

45:14.360 --> 45:16.681
You're a very self-aware person, Stella.

45:18.160 --> 45:20.731
You spend a lot of time observing yourself.

45:22.160 --> 45:24.162
You have sex in the head.

45:25.720 --> 45:28.803
I doubt you've ever
fully given yourself to anyone.

45:29.480 --> 45:32.529
I doubt you ever truly lose yourself.

45:32.680 --> 45:34.682
And you have?

45:35.760 --> 45:39.162
The thoughts, the feelings that I experience...

45:39.960 --> 45:43.282
...are way beyond anything
that you could call fantasies.

45:44.360 --> 45:46.966
Sounds and colours are more vivid.

45:47.120 --> 45:49.282
Odours more intense.

45:50.240 --> 45:54.086
My skin becomes sensitive
to even the slightest of pressure.

45:55.120 --> 45:59.170
The outside world means nothing-
Only the interior world is real.

46:00.400 --> 46:03.563
It is utterly compelling,

46:03.720 --> 46:05.722
compulsive.

46:06.840 --> 46:09.571
Nothing can pull you back from the edge.

46:09.720 --> 46:13.202
Not laws or threats of punishment...

46:13.360 --> 46:16.489
morality, religion, fear of death.

46:18.000 --> 46:22.688
All of those things are as meaningless
as the life that you're about to extinguish.

46:28.520 --> 46:30.488
When was your first attack?

46:32.000 --> 46:34.002
Did it all start with Rose?

46:35.880 --> 46:39.521
Are there other victims...
that we don't know about?

46:39.680 --> 46:41.921
Victims before Fiona Gallagher?

46:45.200 --> 46:46.850
No.

46:48.440 --> 46:50.886
Fiona Gallagher was the first.

46:52.400 --> 46:54.641
The first person you murdered?

46:58.120 --> 46:59.724
Yes.

47:06.560 --> 47:10.406
<i>You admit to violent sexual fantasies
from the age of 12.</i>

47:10.560 --> 47:14.645
How did you resist acting on those fantasies
until the age of 30?

47:15.360 --> 47:17.362
What sustained you?

47:18.720 --> 47:21.121
I always had a project to occupy myself.

47:21.800 --> 47:23.484
A Project?

47:23.640 --> 47:25.130
A woman.

47:25.280 --> 47:27.044
To study.

47:29.480 --> 47:31.050
Did you break into their houses?

47:31.200 --> 47:32.964
Yes.

47:33.120 --> 47:35.361
Steal their undergarments?

47:36.280 --> 47:37.406
Yes.

47:37.560 --> 47:39.244
Attack them?

47:40.720 --> 47:42.324
No.

47:42.480 --> 47:44.482
Why not?

47:45.600 --> 47:47.090
I was...

47:48.720 --> 47:51.200
I had children.

47:51.360 --> 47:53.362
You still have children.

47:53.520 --> 47:55.522
Small children.

47:56.360 --> 47:59.603
You're a barren spinster so you wouldn't know,

47:59.760 --> 48:02.161
but small children take up all your time.

48:05.600 --> 48:07.887
Tell me about the first time.

48:11.200 --> 48:12.964
What was it like?

48:16.880 --> 48:18.882
It made me sick.

48:21.400 --> 48:23.721
The smell disgusted me.

48:25.280 --> 48:28.523
The first was the worst and hardest to get over.

48:28.680 --> 48:32.401
But a switch had been flicked, a line crossed.

48:33.720 --> 48:36.326
Something was done
that couldn't be undone.

48:37.520 --> 48:40.603
Something that separates you
from the common herd.

48:42.600 --> 48:44.728
I was ill for four days after.

48:46.720 --> 48:49.200
You're in a state of existential shock.

48:51.440 --> 48:55.525
But then you find yourself unchallenged
by divine and secular power.

48:56.200 --> 48:58.248
OK.

48:58.400 --> 49:01.882
So why not do it again...but better?

49:06.080 --> 49:07.650
Alice Monroe?

49:07.800 --> 49:09.609
Yes.

49:11.480 --> 49:13.801
Tell me about Alice Monroe.

49:16.600 --> 49:18.807
With Alice, Hook her to another place.

49:19.520 --> 49:21.761
I spent time with her after.

49:21.920 --> 49:26.130
Washed her, dried her,
put her back to bed, photographed her.

49:28.840 --> 49:31.605
An elevated aestheticism, if you like.

49:33.680 --> 49:36.763
Treating her like a doll, like a mannequin.

49:39.520 --> 49:41.568
Tell me, do you speak to them?

49:41.720 --> 49:44.041
To the women that you torture and kill?

49:46.640 --> 49:48.130
No.

49:49.160 --> 49:50.969
Do they die slowly?

49:53.360 --> 49:55.249
<i>Yes.</i>

49:55.400 --> 49:59.121
Loosening and tightening your grip
around their throat?

49:59.280 --> 50:02.648
Keeping them suspended
between life and death?

50:03.520 --> 50:05.329
<i>Yes.</i>

50:06.080 --> 50:07.969
Binding them first?

50:08.640 --> 50:10.608
<i>Yes.</i>

50:10.760 --> 50:12.888
How long do you torture them?

50:15.560 --> 50:18.086
Do you inflict sexual acts upon them?

50:18.240 --> 50:20.971
- I'm not a rapist.
- You violate them.

50:21.640 --> 50:23.130
You're a rapist.

50:24.040 --> 50:27.169
I perform no overt sexual acts on my victims.

50:27.320 --> 50:33.566
You are driven by sexual fantasies...
and you act out with force.

50:40.320 --> 50:43.688
Tell me about these rituals that you perform.

50:44.640 --> 50:49.168
About the washing, the drying,
the painting of the nails, the putting back to bed.

50:50.760 --> 50:52.683
What is there to tell?

50:53.680 --> 50:55.887
Do you take and keep souvenirs?

50:56.840 --> 50:58.808
What do you think?

51:02.160 --> 51:04.811
I think a lock of hair.

51:05.760 --> 51:09.082
And you don’t just photograph them,
you also film them,

51:09.240 --> 51:11.561
acting as your own pornographer.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.924
Tell me, how does it feel afterwards?

51:22.240 --> 51:23.810
Renewed.

51:26.680 --> 51:27.727
Guilt?

51:27.880 --> 51:29.723
Shame?

51:29.880 --> 51:31.530
Remorse? Fear?

51:31.680 --> 51:33.728
You must feel fear?

51:39.000 --> 51:42.846
So tell me, did Sarah Kay
represent perfection to you?

51:43.880 --> 51:44.961
Perfection?

51:45.120 --> 51:46.884
Aesthetically?

51:49.000 --> 51:51.082
Maybe.

51:51.720 --> 51:53.802
But she was pregnant.

51:57.640 --> 52:01.964
You wrote that you feel protective
towards children.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.765
Why do children
have protective status in your world

52:06.920 --> 52:10.129
when someone like Sarah Kay doesn't?

52:11.640 --> 52:15.964
Where does your
sentimental view on childhood come from?

52:16.120 --> 52:18.646
How does it accord with the truth of your own?

52:18.800 --> 52:22.441
A tale of...abandonment and abuse.

52:26.240 --> 52:28.288
Who is Big Foot Chester?

52:30.960 --> 52:32.007
What?

52:32.160 --> 52:37.485
You created a video messaging account
under that name and with one contact -

52:37.640 --> 52:39.085
Katrina Benedetto.

52:39.240 --> 52:42.164
I was wondering what that name denotes.

52:46.960 --> 52:48.962
She's just 16.

52:50.800 --> 52:52.882
A child surely?

52:53.040 --> 52:56.044
And yet you performed
a sex act on yourself for her.

52:57.280 --> 52:59.282
She recorded it.

53:01.720 --> 53:04.724
What could you possibly gain
from corrupting her?

53:06.920 --> 53:09.491
And how is that being protective of children?

53:11.360 --> 53:16.082
What did Sarah Kay ever do
to make her a potential victim...

53:16.840 --> 53:21.448
“when, say...Olivia...is not?

53:23.600 --> 53:25.284
She's my daughter.

53:25.440 --> 53:29.240
All of your victims are daughters.

53:30.360 --> 53:33.011
Where did your hatred of women come from?

53:33.160 --> 53:34.969
I don't hate women.

53:35.120 --> 53:38.806
I hate everyone and everything,
including myself,

53:39.600 --> 53:41.250
Olivia?

53:42.760 --> 53:45.366
Once a man has achieved contempt for himself,

53:45.520 --> 53:48.683
he achieves contempt
for all man-made laws and moralities

53:48.840 --> 53:51.286
and is truly free to do as he wills.

53:52.880 --> 53:55.201
You're under arrest.

53:55.360 --> 53:57.567
You're going to prison.

53:58.520 --> 54:00.568
In what sense are you free?

54:00.720 --> 54:05.362
I live at a level of intensity
unknown to you and others of your type.

54:05.520 --> 54:08.046
You will never know the almost god-like power

54:08.200 --> 54:11.204
that I feel when that last bit of breath
leaves a body.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.446
That feeling of complete possession.

54:14.600 --> 54:16.648
Yes, you felt empowered...

54:17.800 --> 54:19.802
...invincible even...

54:21.400 --> 54:23.528
...but you're under arrest.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.321
Maybe you did possess your victims.

54:28.480 --> 54:30.687
But you couldn't keep them...

54:30.840 --> 54:32.922
and now they're gone...

54:33.080 --> 54:35.082
and you're alone.

54:39.520 --> 54:41.522
Fuck you.

54:52.360 --> 54:54.567
It's an addiction...

54:55.640 --> 54:57.688
...like every other.

54:58.800 --> 55:01.610
It's an addiction that needs to be fed.

55:02.480 --> 55:04.960
It's an addiction that enslaves you.

55:05.880 --> 55:09.851
How is that different from the many
and varied compulsions that drive you?

55:10.600 --> 55:12.921
Your obsession with your father?

55:13.560 --> 55:19.329
His looks, his eyes,
his voice, his skin, his smell.

55:21.680 --> 55:28.040
Are you sure, that way back...
beyond your ability to truly remember.“

55:29.640 --> 55:31.768
...are you sure that he didn't possess you?

55:33.840 --> 55:38.767
Little Stella, in the night, make you his?

55:42.400 --> 55:44.448
It reads that way to me.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.128
If he didn't...

55:49.360 --> 55:51.647
...you sure as hell wanted him to.

55:58.640 --> 56:01.007
The Sarah Kay kill was tainted...

56:02.200 --> 56:04.885
...so you moved against Annie Brawley...

56:05.040 --> 56:07.008
moved way too soon...

56:07.680 --> 56:09.682
...and you got yourself into a fight.

56:09.840 --> 56:13.367
- I think that's called changing the subject.
- Maybe,

56:14.120 --> 56:16.168
You couldn't call it a fight.

56:17.560 --> 56:19.722
It was more of a mismatch.

56:20.720 --> 56:24.122
He came into the room.
I was strangling his sister.

56:25.160 --> 56:27.128
Armed with a heavy piece of wood,

56:27.280 --> 56:30.250
the best he could muster
was a blow across the back.

56:30.400 --> 56:32.721
What kind of bourgeois nonsense -

56:32.880 --> 56:37.920
the influence of parents, teachers,
the church, police officers -

56:38.080 --> 56:43.849
contrives to make you incapable of crushing
another man's skull even to save your sister?

56:44.880 --> 56:48.327
In that moment, his squeamishness,
whatever the fuck,

56:48.480 --> 56:53.884
in that moment, he sealed his fate...
and he should have sealed hers.

56:55.400 --> 56:58.290
A miserable worm bleating, "Annie, Annie!"

57:00.120 --> 57:04.648
He deserved to die choking in a pool
of his own blood, piece of shit.

57:09.520 --> 57:11.761
Don't pretend that you care about him.

57:13.800 --> 57:16.644
You listed the victims to me on the phone.

57:17.520 --> 57:19.488
"For Fiona Gallagher,

57:19.640 --> 57:23.167
Alice Monroe, Sarah Kay, I don't let you.“

57:23.840 --> 57:25.649
No mention of Joe.

57:26.600 --> 57:28.887
What's one more man to you more or less?

57:30.440 --> 57:33.808
Let men perish. Who gives a fuck?

57:37.240 --> 57:39.447
Where's Rose?

57:46.480 --> 57:49.450
<i>...you can do can make me
devalue my life in any way.</i>

57:49.600 --> 57:51.045
<i>I will celebrate life.</i>

57:51.200 --> 57:56.730
<i>I love and I am loved,
and nothing that you can do can take that away.</i>

57:57.440 --> 58:00.444
<i>Do you know that?
Do you know that?</i>

58:07.960 --> 58:10.770
<i>Why the fuck are you watching this?</i>

58:11.080 --> 58:12.684
<i>You sick shit.</i>

58:14.120 --> 58:16.168
<i>What the fuck is wrong with you?</i>

58:16.320 --> 58:18.243
Who were you talking to?

58:18.400 --> 58:19.401
Yourself?

58:19.560 --> 58:21.403
Me?

58:21.560 --> 58:25.849
The people who like to read and watch
programmes about people like you?

58:27.280 --> 58:29.282
Who?

58:31.000 --> 58:33.048
Where is she?

58:34.160 --> 58:36.003
Is she dead?

58:37.360 --> 58:39.089
Tell me.

58:40.480 --> 58:42.528
Where is Rose?

58:47.040 --> 58:49.042
We're done here.

58:49.720 --> 58:51.722
You've got everything you need from me.

58:52.880 --> 58:55.326
But, be aware, it's not over between us.

58:57.560 --> 59:00.882
In fact...it's just begun.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.849
Seems we've got him.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.929
Well done.

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:35.401
<i>Paul Spector, you are charged
that on the 10th day of December, 2011,</i>

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.606
in the County Court Division of Belfast,

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:42.685
you did murder Fiona Gallagher
contrary to Common Law.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:48.770
That you, on the 15th day of March, 2012,
in the County Court Division of Belfast,

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:53.482
did murder Alice Parker Monroe
contrary to Common Law.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:00.491
<i>That you, on the 16th day of April, 2012,
in the County Court Division of Belfast,</i>

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:04.645
<i>did murder Sarah Kay
contrary to Common Law.</i>

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:11.246
<i>That you, on the 20th day of April, 2012,
in the County Court Division of Belfast,</i>

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:15.564
<i>did murder Joseph Brawley
contrary to Common Law.</i>

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.722
<i>That you, on the 20th day of April, 2012,
within the County Court Division of Belfast,</i>

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:28.205
<i>attempted to murder Ann Brawley
contrary to Common Law.</i>

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:35.604
<i>That you, on the 3rd day of May, 2012,
in the County Court Division of Belfast,</i>

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:41.244
<i>unlawfully and injuriously
imprisoned Rose Stagg...</i>

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:47.724
<i>...and detained Rose Stagg against her will
contrary to Common Law.</i>

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.811
<i>Do you want to reply to any of the charges?</i>

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.241
When do you have to go to court again?

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.091
In July.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.971
Are you still gonna sit your exams?

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.162
If the school will let me.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.527
There's so much about him in the papers.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.131
I know.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.768
Did he do it?

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.562
Oh, yes.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.042
Are you all right?

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.480
You said a strange thing.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.685
When?

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:58.650
When you first asked me
to interview Katie Benedetto.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.647
You suggested I was like Spector.

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.288
What did you mean by that?

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.442
I meant what I said.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.721
Similar age...similar looks.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.644
Not anything more?

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.040
Like?

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:23.482
Something deeper...

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:28.041
...deeper in his nature,
that you see reflected in me somehow.

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:32.000
So...you remind me of Spector.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:38.401
I fuck you, therefore I fuck Spector?

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.162
Is that where this is going?

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.169
It's a thought.

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.084
Well...

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.804
...a repellent one.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.962
Would it be so odd?

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.891
There's something fascinating about him...

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.282
...a strange allure.

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:12.282
A woman, I forget who...

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:18.326
...once asked a male friend...
why men felt threatened by women.

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:24.530
He replied that they were afraid
that women might laugh at them.

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:29.931
When she asked a group of women
why women felt threatened by men...

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.050
..they said...

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:36.122
..."We're afraid they might kill us."

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.168
He might fascinate you.

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:50.730
I despise him with every fibre of my being.

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.962
I need to take this.

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:08.043
Gibson.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.362
<i>It's Eastwood, ma'am.</i>

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.010
Go ahead.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.291
<i>Spector has come up with an offer.</i>

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.442
Get dressed.

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.203
Go on.

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:37.729
Are we any clearer on whether it's Rose Stagg
or Rose Stagg's remains?

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:40.645
He's said nothing about that.
He's just given us a location.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:44.964
It's forest...
beyond where Rose's phone was last used...

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.805
..up beyond the quarry, beyond the lair.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.689
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.046
Gibson.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.282
<i>It's Sally Ann Spector.</i>

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.169
<i>I've thought about it.</i>

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.765
<i>I'll bring her in.</i>

01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:58.888
I'll send a car for you right away.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.690
Thank you.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.249
Thank you.

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.882
We're on.

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:10.010
We have to be discreet
about moving him out of here.

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:14.128
Anderson to escort Spector,
with me, in one vehicle.

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:19.689
Two other cars - Ferrington and her partner,
Hagstrom and Mitchell.

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:26.407
Get Ged Green to meet us in the forest
with TSGs and a medical backup.

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:29.647
We'll need a er...a helicopter in the air.

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:32.326
What about Spector's court appearance?

01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:33.925
- Change it.
- OK.

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.481
I'll get the transport organised.

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:40.850
Isn't it just another power play?
Another attempt to control and dominate?

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.764
Yes, but we don't have a choice.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.161
Even if it's a wild-goose chase?

01:08:45.319 --> 01:08:48.051
You know what I've asked you to do.
Just get on with it

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:51.569
Yes, ma'am.

01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:01.402
This is the room we'll be in.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.886
Have a seat there, Olivia.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.481
- Hello, Daddy.
- Hello, darling.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.731
- Thanks for coming to see me.
- It's OK.

01:09:47.279 --> 01:09:49.930
You look funny in those clothes.

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:51.491
These are just work clothes.

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:53.642
Oh, OK.

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:57.291
How's Liam?

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.885
Annoying

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.048
Mummy's been ill.

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:05.368
I know.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.087
There's something I want to say to you...

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.002
...something important.

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:27.083
Watching you grow up has been
the best thing that ever happened to me.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:33.091
I'm sorry for all the times
that you needed a cuddle...

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:36.609
..and I wasn't there.

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:41.806
I'm sorry that the projects in my life
took up so much time.

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:47.046
I should have cherished every moment with you.

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:53.045
I've heard you say that you want to be a doctor...

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.322
...and a pizza-maker...

01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:59.006
and a pilot...and a princess...

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.844
when you grow up.

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:05.202
I just hope that one day...

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:09.329
...despite everything, that you can be happy.

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:11.485
When are you coming home?

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.810
Not for a while.

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:19.485
- I've got work to do here.
- Do you work for her?

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.244
Sort of.

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:31.286
And we have work to do.

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.602
It's time for Olivia to go.

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.364
I love you, little one.

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:48.524
I love you best in the whole wide world, Daddy.

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.162
Thank you.

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.931
Simon, I want to move the people carrier
in between you two,

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:56.481
so if you can pull forward 30 feet?

01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:00.601
Johnny, take the people carrier
in between the two squad cars, please.

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:14.807
Are you sure he's the right choice?

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.928
- Who?
- Anderson.

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:20.880
Wouldn't someone like Martin be better?
Sheer physical presence.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.002
Anderson arrested Spector...

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.242
interviewed him first about Rose..

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.123
He deserves this.

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:31.521
Trust me, he's strong enough.

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:09.727
Callan.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.644
Spector's on the move.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.085
It's me.

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:26.844
Do you still have my car?

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:46.851
- What's happening?
- Spector's being moved.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.048
- Moved where?
- Well, not moved.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.363
He's taking the police somewhere.
I don't know. I just need to get there.

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:54.966
- What was he arrested for?
- Please, I don't have time.

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:57.691
- Where are they going?
- Slieve Duv.

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:00.004
The forest?

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:03.642
- I actually... I don't know any more than that.
- Get in.

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:05.609
- What?
- I'm driving!

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.562
- Jimmy...
- Don't "Jimmy" me, you piece of shit.

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:10.449
If you want to go, get in.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.250
I'm driving.

01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:43.242
Where now?

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:47.129
Keep on this road.
Another half mile.

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:49.651
From Convoy 2.

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:51.848
All units, stand by.

01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.730
<i>From TSG 1. Support vehicles
in position at rendez-vous point.</i>

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.409
There's a track on the left.

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:37.804
Take that track.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.291
From Convoy 2.

01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:41.442
All units, take track on left.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.731
Just up here, there's a stopping point.

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:04.921
All the vehicles should pull over.

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:36.611
In there.

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.688
Can you tell me what I'm gonna find?

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:44.764
In there. 200 yards or so.

01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:02.487
Take that track'
Lead the ambulance.

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:04.688
I'm going in.
Keep pace with me.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.444
Keep everyone else out of the forest.

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:08.841
There's no sense in contaminating
a crime scene.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.490
Yes, ma'am.

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.571
There's nothing here.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:32.722
<i>There's no sign of Rose.</i>

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.761
Tell her to keep going.

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:37.570
Go deeper, Stella.

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:41.129
Prisoner says to keep going, ma'am.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.802
(Helicopter approaching}

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:27.684
There's clearly something
going on between you,

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:33.284
What?

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.287
You and the fragrant Stella.

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:42.564
Is that right?

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:45.762
Let me give you some advice.

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:49.842
If you haven’t done it yet, don't.

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:55.523
I have tasted both the fantasy and the deed-.

01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:59.201
The fantasy is way more piquant.

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.490
Rose's car is here.

01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:37.563
<i>I repeat, Rose's car is here.</i>

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.484
<i>I'm going to take a look.</i>

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.483
Roger. Copy that.

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:19.809
- Ged, we need a crowbar.
- <i>Understood. On my way.</i>

01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:27.482
Here, ma'am.

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.321
Jesus.

01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.968
I don’t feel a pulse.

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:53.044
- There's no rigor.
- That could have passed by now.

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:58.769
She's chilled, Ged, but she's not stone cold.

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:01.764
Jesus Christ, she's alive.

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.082
She's alive.

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:07.963
Unexpected.

01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:11.966
Get the medics up here now.

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:18.570
<i>There's another individual
on the edge of the woods.</i>

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:20.643
<i>Someone we can't account for.</i>

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:24.844
<i>They're directly north
from the parked police vehicles.</i>

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.729
<i>Directly north.</i>

01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:29.008
Get one of the uniforms to check that out.

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:31.811
Control to Alpha Papa 5. Come in, please.

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:34.850
- Alpha Papa 5.
<i>- Movement on the ground detected.</i>

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.731
<i>Due north of your position.
Please investigates.</i>

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:40.531
Alpha Papa 5. Received and understood.

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:50.722
Right, guys? And lift.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.526
Don't lose her. Please don't lose her.

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:08.602
Looks like he left her water.

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:10.444
Food even.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:13.080
Jesus Christ. Can you imagine?

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.088
Cordon off the area, Ged.

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:19.364
Yes, ma'am.

01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:34.642
Drop what you're holding
and put your hands behind your head!

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.322
Have you seen this, ma'am?

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.804
Good God.

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:00.682
We need an ambulance!

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.803
Shit!

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:07.524
- Don't move. Stay still.
- I need something to tamp the blood!

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:21.641
We need help!

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.480
- Can nothing land?
- We've got three men down here.

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:29.644
- We need urgent medical back up.
<i>- I can't land.</i>

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:32.929
<i>The trees are too dense.
Repeat. I can't land.</i>

01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:34.844
- Jesus Christ.
- The trees are too dense.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.288
Get a medic up here now!
Go, go, go, go go!

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:44.284
Oh...

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.402
Oh, we're losing him.

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.522
We're losing him!
