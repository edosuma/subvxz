01:11.006 --> 01:13.505
Gentlemen, thank you for
attending the meeting.

01:13.506 --> 01:17.349
Now, let me begin by saying that it
can't have escaped anyone's attention

01:17.350 --> 01:20.830
that things have been getting
rather strained around here of late.

01:20.831 --> 01:23.115
It's no secret that
morale is on the floor.

01:23.116 --> 01:25.859
We've lost all trace of Red
Dwarf, tempers are strained.

01:25.860 --> 01:28.361
I don't know about you but
I certainly feel better.

01:28.362 --> 01:31.135
And thank you for your
contributions, gentlemen.

01:31.136 --> 01:34.021
See you at next week's
morale meeting. Marvellous!

01:37.020 --> 01:38.984
Good meeting.

01:39.019 --> 01:39.992
What's eating him?

01:40.027 --> 01:42.094
Well, I'm no psychologist,
sir, but maybe

01:42.095 --> 01:45.639
the bleak lonely pointless emptiness
of our hopeless futile predicament

01:45.640 --> 01:47.017
is beginning to get to him.

01:49.035 --> 01:50.030
Autopilot alert.

01:58.031 --> 01:59.993
Storm front ahead. Switching to manual.

02:00.028 --> 02:02.032
It's a big one,
too late to go round! It's right on us!

02:03.032 --> 02:05.589
Stellar fog - tightly-packed
particles from an exploded supernova.

02:05.590 --> 02:08.032
Our scanners won't be able to
penetrate more than a few metres.

02:11.729 --> 02:12.829
Slowing to minimum.

02:13.029 --> 02:14.844
Gentlemen, absolute concentration
til we get through this squall.

02:14.845 --> 02:16.027
There could be anything
lurking out there.

02:16.562 --> 02:19.129
Don't worry, bud. If there's
anything out there, we'll spot it.

02:20.042 --> 02:21.004
Anyone hurt?

02:21.039 --> 02:23.045
No, but my pride sure needs mouth-to-mouth.

02:24.042 --> 02:27.042
Mr. Lister, sir! He's out cold!

02:28.043 --> 02:30.040
All stop. Let's get him up to the obs room.

02:32.042 --> 02:33.009
How is he?

02:33.044 --> 02:34.943
Not good, sir. Perhaps
you'd better look away.

02:34.944 --> 02:37.044
I know you can't stand the sight of blood.

02:37.079 --> 02:39.037
Don't worry, Kryten. It's
okay when it's Lister's.

02:41.057 --> 02:41.757
Impossible!

02:42.064 --> 02:42.864
What?

02:43.057 --> 02:44.024
Look!

02:44.759 --> 02:46.062
Mr. Lister is a droid!

02:47.058 --> 02:47.758
He's a what?

02:48.060 --> 02:52.803
There's no doubt about it. He's
entirely mechanical, a 3000 series.

02:52.804 --> 02:57.058
Made in Taiwan. Look! Look, he
has a 24-hour callout number.

02:58.082 --> 03:01.081
This doesn't tie up. If he wasn't human,
I'd have known by his scent.

03:01.116 --> 03:02.078
X- rays confirm it.

03:05.076 --> 03:08.366
This is so strange. Mr. Lister's
always been an icon of mine,

03:08.367 --> 03:12.080
and now I found he's an earlier
model, and technically I outrank him.

03:13.075 --> 03:16.076
An earlier model? Then how come he looks
so much more sophisticated than you?

03:17.079 --> 03:21.063
Sir, just because I have a head shaped
like a freak formation of mashed potatoes

03:21.064 --> 03:23.080
does not mean that I am unsophisticated.

03:23.115 --> 03:26.040
Alright then, why does he
look more realistically human?

03:26.075 --> 03:29.234
Humans have always found exact
duplicates rather disturbing, sir.

03:29.235 --> 03:32.633
The 3000 series was notoriously
unpopular. Most of them were recalled.

03:32.634 --> 03:36.079
A few slipped the net and went
undercover to make new lives in society.

03:37.078 --> 03:37.978
Do you think he knows?

03:38.075 --> 03:41.078
Unlikely. He probably reprogrammed
his own memory to escape detection.

03:42.080 --> 03:46.076
This is going to crack him up,
devastate him! Who's going to tell him?

03:47.076 --> 03:48.076
I'll write you into my
will if you let it be me.

03:50.078 --> 03:53.072
I suggest you leave this to me, sirs.
I'll have a talk with him droid-to-droid.

03:54.076 --> 03:55.889
Okay. We'll get going and try
to get out of this damn fog

03:55.890 --> 03:57.077
before it drains our solar batteries.

04:02.078 --> 04:03.079
What happened? What hit us?

04:04.074 --> 04:07.628
Something in the stellar fog,
sir, didn't show up on the scans.

04:07.629 --> 04:10.072
Sir, do you remember
who your parents were?

04:11.074 --> 04:13.072
Kryten, you know I don't. I was
found under a pool table, in a box.

04:15.071 --> 04:18.413
Did anyone ever tell you
what was written on that box?

04:18.414 --> 04:22.607
Were the words "kit" or "paint
before assembly" written on the side?

04:22.608 --> 04:24.819
It's just that while you were under,

04:24.820 --> 04:28.075
wediscovered something
rather disturbing about you.

04:28.110 --> 04:30.000
It's that tatoo on me
inner thigh, isn't it?

04:30.001 --> 04:31.470
Well, I don't really love Peterson,

04:31.471 --> 04:34.073
he just got me so drunk that
I didn't know what I was doing.

04:35.073 --> 04:39.091
It's not the tatoo, sir. There's
no easy way of breaking this gently.

04:39.092 --> 04:42.075
I'm afraid, sir, you are
not human. You're a droid.

04:43.071 --> 04:44.033
I'm a what?

04:44.068 --> 04:48.072
You're a mechanical, 3000 series.
Technically subordinate to me!

04:49.070 --> 04:50.032
What does this all mean?

04:50.067 --> 04:53.143
Well, in broad terms, I get
the front seat in the cockpit,

04:53.144 --> 04:55.072
and you're in charge of the laundry!

04:57.068 --> 04:58.071
Kryten; And I want to see creases!

05:00.068 --> 05:05.076
Kryten, have a heart, man. I'm in major
stress-related shock here. overload.

05:06.072 --> 05:08.274
You're a droid, you
don't have real emotions.

05:08.275 --> 05:12.069
It's just syntha-shock. Now stop thinking
like a human and go about your duties.

05:13.071 --> 05:15.071
Kryten, Why are you being so heartless?

05:15.150 --> 05:17.980
I looked after you. You
encouraged me to break

05:17.981 --> 05:20.339
my programming and ape human behaviour.

05:20.340 --> 05:22.632
Now I find out you're no better than I!

05:22.633 --> 05:25.688
But worst of all, the most
bitter pill to swallow,

05:25.689 --> 05:29.940
for four long years, I had to
hand-scrub the gussets of your longjohns.

05:29.941 --> 05:34.014
Now, unless you want to wallow in
the eternal fires of Silicon Hell,

05:34.015 --> 05:38.146
I suggest you bring a tray of
refreshments up to the cockpit, pronto!

05:48.180 --> 05:48.880
What was the jolt?

05:49.175 --> 05:52.141
It's a mystery, bud. Nothing on
the scanners, nothing on visual.

05:52.176 --> 05:54.479
It's like we've gone through
some sort of energy pocket.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.176
Still, it looks like
we're out of it now.

05:56.211 --> 05:59.174
Better run a crosscheck and see if this
phenomena is mentioned in of our databases.

06:00.184 --> 06:03.182
Tea, all! Sorry I took so long but
I didn't know where anything was.

06:04.176 --> 06:05.178
Let me see that tray, please.

06:06.682 --> 06:07.477
Why?

06:08.176 --> 06:14.435
That's "why, Mr. Kryten sir"... You
call those triangular sandwiches?

06:14.536 --> 06:21.214
Did you use a z-square? I think not! And
the chocolate fingers display is laughable.

06:22.615 --> 06:24.753
Don't just pile them
higgledy-piggledy onto the plate.

06:24.754 --> 06:28.084
Make them into an attractive interlaced
log cabin structure or something.

06:28.685 --> 06:32.574
This will just not do! Kindly return
to the gallery and start again.

06:33.177 --> 06:36.179
Okay... sir. This doesn't feel
right... Not right at all...

06:37.178 --> 06:39.177
What a charlatan all these years.

06:39.212 --> 06:40.174
Any idea what hit us yet?

06:41.173 --> 06:42.639
Wait, wait, here's something.

06:42.640 --> 06:46.177
Reports of artificial stellar fogs
which contain reality mindfields.

06:47.175 --> 06:48.140
Reality what?

06:48.175 --> 06:52.281
Bubbles or pockets of unreality which
when encountered create false realities

06:52.282 --> 06:55.176
designed to disorient and
drive off potential looters.

06:55.211 --> 06:56.137
From what?

06:56.172 --> 06:59.594
It's a defence device fitted to
space corp test ships which are fitted

06:59.595 --> 07:01.908
with prototype drives
so awesome in their power

07:01.909 --> 07:04.173
that they have to be
safeguarded at all costs.

07:05.177 --> 07:07.139
So we just crashed through
an unreality pocket?

07:07.174 --> 07:12.174
Which created a false reality making
us believe Mr. Lister was... Oh my...

07:23.170 --> 07:24.171
You mean he's not a...

07:24.206 --> 07:25.178
No...

07:27.173 --> 07:28.073
Tea's upstairs.

07:28.174 --> 07:29.140
Sir, I, ah...

07:29.175 --> 07:33.471
What do you think of the picket fence?

07:39.572 --> 07:40.565
I'm not happy with it meself.

07:40.566 --> 07:42.175
But I'll go away and
do it again if you want.

07:42.246 --> 07:43.947
Sir, may I see your arm?

07:47.243 --> 07:50.238
Smeg! It looks normal - human!

07:51.241 --> 07:55.238
Someone else tell him.
I've got gussets to scrub!

08:03.263 --> 08:04.149
Starbug is small.

08:04.150 --> 08:08.425
We can probably pick our way through
without hitting any more unreality bubbles.

08:09.026 --> 08:12.075
Someone's gone to plenty big trouble
to keep space craft out of here,

08:12.076 --> 08:14.265
and it's got to be
worth finding out why.

08:14.300 --> 08:15.261
But how can we guarantee we'll -

08:16.261 --> 08:17.027
- We hit one!
- We hit one!

08:17.462 --> 08:18.362
That's what I said.

08:18.397 --> 08:19.263
Where's the Cat?

08:19.298 --> 08:20.226
I'm here.

08:20.261 --> 08:21.260
They've taken the Cat! He's gone!

08:22.258 --> 08:23.223
I'm not gone - I'm here!

08:23.258 --> 08:25.259
Someone just erased him from existence.

08:25.294 --> 08:27.261
Then how come we still remember him?

08:28.263 --> 08:29.163
Remember who?

08:29.261 --> 08:29.961
I don't remember.

08:32.261 --> 08:35.062
Hey buds, don't do this to me! You
can't forget me. I'm unforgettable!

08:35.260 --> 08:38.255
I don't get this! We're passing through an
unreality pocket and everything's normal!

08:39.258 --> 08:41.259
What do you mean everything's
normal? I feel invisible!

08:42.256 --> 08:44.254
This doesn't make any sense! All systems
check. The three of us are here as normal.

08:45.258 --> 08:48.057
The four of us! There's
four of us! Look!

08:48.058 --> 08:51.256
I'm here! Can't you hear
me, can't you feel me?

08:52.260 --> 08:53.254
We're getting some bumping in!

08:55.262 --> 08:56.255
Passing back into normal space.

08:58.559 --> 08:59.559
What are you doing?

09:01.659 --> 09:02.761
Can you see me?

09:03.259 --> 09:04.263
Of course I can see ya.

09:05.256 --> 09:07.134
You all forgot who I
was. Don't you remember?

09:07.135 --> 09:09.257
This is too weird in here.
Let's quit while we can.

09:09.292 --> 09:11.253
What we have to do is keep our heads.

09:16.253 --> 09:18.254
Boy! This is worse than
triple-strength catnip!

09:20.254 --> 09:22.254
The pockets are getting denser and
closer together. We're never going to...

09:23.258 --> 09:23.958
make it!

09:28.258 --> 09:29.158
We can't take much more of this.

09:29.255 --> 09:30.245
Well, just ignore it.

09:30.646 --> 09:34.252
All these unreality pockets are designed
to make you feel absurd and disorientated.

09:35.252 --> 09:37.253
He's right! Let's just keep going
and we'll get out the other side.

09:39.654 --> 09:41.233
All ahead stop. We have got to talk.

09:41.234 --> 09:44.257
Kryten, how far would you
say it is to the epicentre?

09:44.292 --> 09:46.773
At our current speed, about
another three days, sir.

09:46.808 --> 09:49.255
Okay, you win. Let's get out of here.

09:56.704 --> 09:59.704
We successfully penetrated the mindfield,
sir. We're through to the epicentre.

10:00.702 --> 10:01.670
So what was it protecting?

10:01.705 --> 10:06.065
Derelicts! According to the
computer, it's from the 28th century.

10:06.466 --> 10:07.705
And it's capable of time travel?!

10:08.140 --> 10:08.999
Crew?

10:09.700 --> 10:11.700
All dead. This was the maiden voyage.

10:12.301 --> 10:16.010
They contracted an influenza virus
on an incursion to the 20th century.

10:16.411 --> 10:19.031
Before they died, they programmed
the autopilot for deep space

10:19.032 --> 10:23.699
and generated the mindfield to prevent the
machine from falling into the wrong hands.

10:23.734 --> 10:27.701
Does this mean what I think it means?
We board it, strip out the drive -

10:28.704 --> 10:31.698
and bingo! We've got
ourselves a time machine!

10:31.733 --> 10:32.702
Let's see if the sucker works!

10:35.703 --> 10:36.700
Sirs, choose any year.

10:37.362 --> 10:42.360
Let's go to someplace nice and
safe and dull. How about 1422?

10:43.360 --> 10:44.363
How about 1421?

10:45.365 --> 10:46.326
What's the difference?

10:46.361 --> 10:49.363
No difference. I just wanted to make
it look like I was paying attention.

10:51.358 --> 10:55.360
1421 loaded, sir. August
17th. Engaging the time drive.

11:00.359 --> 11:02.323
Hey, we did it!

11:02.358 --> 11:05.443
Indeed we did. All the
ship's chronometers indicate

11:05.444 --> 11:09.359
that this is August the 16th, in
the year 1421, just one day out.

11:10.355 --> 11:11.355
Give us visual. Let's see
what it's like out there.

11:12.359 --> 11:13.354
Okay, punching it up.

11:15.355 --> 11:17.357
Again? We're still where we were!

11:18.356 --> 11:22.921
Of course. We're still
in deep space, sir,

11:22.922 --> 11:30.353
only now we're in deep space in the
15th century. Isn't it wonderful?

11:31.393 --> 11:32.398
Taking her back to the present.

11:33.397 --> 11:34.393
Keyed in. Engaged.

11:39.094 --> 11:43.534
So... forgive me if I'm being thicker
than the offspring of a village idiot

11:43.535 --> 11:48.090
and a TV weathergirl, but what exactly
was the point of that little exercise?

11:48.125 --> 11:52.079
Well, at the moment, yes, but should we
ever acquire a faster-than-light drive,

11:52.080 --> 11:55.094
we will have the combination
to travel anywhere and anywhen.

11:55.293 --> 11:56.058
Picking up a craft.

11:56.093 --> 11:58.091
He's right. Some kind of
craft. Small. Here it comes.

11:59.090 --> 12:01.817
It's a Jupiter Mining
Corporation core sign.

12:01.818 --> 12:03.696
Some kind of transport vehicle:

12:03.697 --> 12:07.089
colour green, lifeforms
four... craft name "Starbug"?!

12:08.550 --> 12:11.551
Call me crazy, but that all
sounds weirdly familiar. Who is it?

12:11.586 --> 12:15.546
It's us from the future! Hey
- incoming SOS message!

12:15.581 --> 12:16.553
Don't punch it up! Close com!

12:16.816 --> 12:17.516
Why?

12:17.551 --> 12:21.551
If that vessel is this vessel, sir, it
almost certainly contains our future selves.

12:21.552 --> 12:24.266
The implications of making
contact could be devastating!

12:24.267 --> 12:27.552
The human brain is not designed to
cope with knowing its own future.

12:27.587 --> 12:30.156
Yeah, but Kryten, obviously we've
been in some kind of major trouble.

12:30.157 --> 12:31.514
Otherwise we wouldn't have shown up.

12:31.549 --> 12:34.433
No, Kryten's got a point. It's
too dangerous to make contact.

12:34.434 --> 12:37.549
What if we discover that one of
us is dead? Who could handle that?

12:37.584 --> 12:38.555
We all could if it was you.

12:41.552 --> 12:43.901
They're trying us again!
Come on, they're in trouble!

12:43.902 --> 12:45.510
We can't just leave them out to dry!

12:45.545 --> 12:48.643
Well, in that case, sir, I suggest
that I am left alone to make contact.

12:48.644 --> 12:50.766
I can give them whatever
assistance they require,

12:50.767 --> 12:52.548
then erase my memory
of the entire event.

12:52.583 --> 12:56.442
Open com. Present Starbug calling future
Starbug. We are ready to communicate.

13:02.438 --> 13:04.439
Well, how did it go? Everything okay?

13:05.434 --> 13:12.988
Mr. Lister, sir... I love
you! You know that, don't you?

13:13.589 --> 13:16.437
I'd hate you to... go anywhere
without knowing that, sir.

13:21.433 --> 13:23.436
So what's the SP, Kryts?
Can you tell us anything?

13:24.440 --> 13:27.264
A little, sir. They are
indeed our future selves

13:27.265 --> 13:30.434
from some fifteen years
hence. What a senseless waste!

13:32.436 --> 13:34.436
Listen, if something happens
to me, I want to know.

13:35.471 --> 13:39.003
All I am allowed to divulge is that
their time drive has developed a fault,

13:39.004 --> 13:41.700
and they can only travel
forward. They jumped to a period

13:41.701 --> 13:43.373
where they knew we would be in order

13:43.374 --> 13:45.464
to copy some components
from our own drive.

13:45.499 --> 13:48.461
So am I actually going to get to meet
me? My knees have turned to jelly!

13:49.475 --> 13:50.906
Nobody will be meeting anybody.

13:50.907 --> 13:54.462
You must be sealed in the upper deck
before they set a space boot on board.

13:54.497 --> 13:56.428
So when are they coming?

13:56.463 --> 13:59.860
Immediately. I'll serve
your supper in the obs room.

13:59.861 --> 14:02.809
I thought I'd whip you
up a nice little curry

14:02.810 --> 14:06.462
with jam rolly-polly and a
big jug of chilled margarita.

14:06.497 --> 14:07.432
They're all my favourites!

14:07.467 --> 14:08.462
I know!

14:09.460 --> 14:12.362
How can we have margaritas? I
thought we were out of tequila?

14:12.397 --> 14:16.731
I put a little miniature bottle aside,
sir, for... no particular reason...

14:17.332 --> 14:18.869
And I thought that since today had...

14:18.870 --> 14:22.393
no special significance... it
would be appropriate... to...

14:22.828 --> 14:23.709
Just go, Kryten!

14:24.144 --> 14:24.991
Thank you, sir.

14:31.787 --> 14:36.773
His favourite bowl... his little cup...

14:38.874 --> 14:41.395
the tin opener he uses to
pick his ears clean with...

14:43.392 --> 14:44.356
Everything okay?

14:44.391 --> 14:47.395
Oh, yup yup. Those darn
onions get you every time!

14:48.392 --> 14:49.395
What onions?

14:50.392 --> 14:52.176
Ah, the onions I'm about to peel.

14:53.677 --> 14:56.394
I always get a little emotional when
I have to deprive an onion of its skin.

14:57.590 --> 15:00.405
Don't Nixon me, man! Tell me the truth!

15:01.306 --> 15:05.353
I die, don't I? I mean, I'm
dead, aren't I? I don't make it...

15:05.388 --> 15:09.050
All I'm at liberty to disclose, sir, is
that all four members of the Starbug crew

15:09.051 --> 15:10.390
will be boarding this vessel.

15:10.425 --> 15:12.353
Yeah, but I'm not amongst them, right?

15:12.888 --> 15:14.787
One of their number
is called Dave Lister.

15:14.788 --> 15:17.393
Now, you'll have to excuse
me. I've already said too much.

15:18.393 --> 15:20.393
Hang on a minute, I'm really confused
now. Are you saying I survive?

15:21.394 --> 15:25.393
I can say no more. Please, let us
not squabble on this of all days.

15:26.391 --> 15:27.820
Careful with those chilies, Kryten.

15:27.821 --> 15:30.392
At the rate you're going,
there'll be none left for tomorrow.

15:38.391 --> 15:41.357
Look, whatever it is, there's nothing
you can do about it. It's fate.

15:41.392 --> 15:46.390
I just don't get it. Am I dead or am I
alive? If I'm dead, how can I come on board?

15:47.386 --> 15:48.352
What precisely are you doing, bud?

15:48.387 --> 15:52.115
I'm hacking into the security cameras.
Kryten turned off all the monitors,

15:52.116 --> 15:56.389
so I'm rigging up the mediscan. When those
johnnies come on board, I want to see 'em.

15:57.394 --> 16:00.389
Docking complete. Opening airlock
doors. Gentlemen, welcome aboard.

16:10.388 --> 16:12.390
Ah, Mr. Rimmer sir, come in, come in.

16:17.390 --> 16:21.389
Did we actually used to live like this?
What a godawful depressing little hole.

16:25.581 --> 16:27.595
We're used to the good
things in life now, bud.

16:34.598 --> 16:35.595
Are you really me?

16:36.597 --> 16:39.595
Will you take a look at him. Did
I really used to look that goofy?

16:41.599 --> 16:44.599
What is that you have on your head?
I hope you have a quarantine license for it.

16:45.600 --> 16:50.094
We're time travellers now, and a lot of
our business involves going back in history.

16:50.095 --> 16:54.112
I have to look incognito. Frankly, I
can't afford going around looking like

16:54.113 --> 16:56.597
I've swapped heads with
a damaged crash dummy.

16:57.600 --> 17:02.025
I rather think we're overstepping the
bounds of agreed conversation here.

17:02.026 --> 17:04.596
Is, um... Mr. Lister...
did you bring him?

17:08.597 --> 17:11.592
Sir, you look terrific. I was
expecting something much worse.

17:12.596 --> 17:14.593
Don't worry about me, Kryts,
I'm fine. Absolutely dandy.

17:15.594 --> 17:17.862
Well, blow me! You've
hardly changed at all.

17:17.863 --> 17:21.592
If I wasn't told about the accident,
I don't think I'd even have noticed.

17:23.598 --> 17:28.597
Yo, we're in! Oh my god - look at Rimmer!

17:30.290 --> 17:31.069
Well, I can't have changed
much. I'm a hologram.

17:32.068 --> 17:35.065
Wrong. You're two meals away
from being a sumo wrestler.

17:36.066 --> 17:36.816
Let me see!

17:36.851 --> 17:37.567
Am I there?

17:37.967 --> 17:38.767
Oh yes.

17:39.065 --> 17:40.030
What do I look like?

17:40.065 --> 17:41.603
I can't actually see quite clearly.

17:41.604 --> 17:44.064
The light is reflecting from
off the top of your head.

17:46.064 --> 17:46.864
What are you talking about?

17:48.063 --> 17:50.067
Ha ha! You're as bald as
a plucked chicken, man.

17:51.067 --> 17:52.030
Let me see! Let me see!

17:52.065 --> 17:53.950
Wait, wait! I want to see if I'm there.

17:54.851 --> 18:02.062
I don't seem to be there. Just
you two, Kryten... Oh my god...

18:03.064 --> 18:04.062
What? What is it?

18:08.063 --> 18:09.063
Ohhhhh dear!

18:10.633 --> 18:12.638
What do I do to end up like that?

18:13.635 --> 18:19.550
That's tragic. That is the saddest
thing I've ever seen in my life...

18:19.551 --> 18:25.633
What happened to my butt? Buddy, you
could park a plane in that crease.

18:26.635 --> 18:30.674
So what if you're fat and bald.
That's what happens when you get older.

18:30.675 --> 18:32.637
Look at me
- I'm a brain in a jar!

18:32.672 --> 18:34.633
Self self self self self!

18:36.637 --> 18:37.636
We've got to find out what's going on.

18:40.630 --> 18:43.720
We've been saving it
for a special occasion.

18:43.721 --> 18:47.633
And what could be more special
than this. To the future!

18:49.637 --> 18:50.437
To the past!

18:54.636 --> 18:55.630
This is poison, bud!

18:56.630 --> 18:58.633
Haven't you anything better than
this hogwash? We're used to the best!

18:59.640 --> 19:00.764
Kryten, we're epicures now.

19:00.765 --> 19:03.635
We travel through history enjoying
the very best time has to offer.

19:04.635 --> 19:07.144
Dolphin sweetmeats,
roast suckling elephants,

19:07.145 --> 19:10.635
baby seal hearts stuffed with
dove pate. Food fit for emperors!

19:10.670 --> 19:13.283
We socialize with all of the
greatest figures in history,

19:13.284 --> 19:14.634
the Hapsburgs, the Borgias...

19:15.635 --> 19:18.630
Why, only last week, Louis the Sixteenth
threw a banquet especially in our honour.

19:19.629 --> 19:21.628
The man is a complete delight
- urbane, witty, charming...

19:22.631 --> 19:25.329
He was an idiotic despot who
lived in the most obscene luxury

19:25.330 --> 19:27.635
while the working classes
starved in abject poverty.

19:27.670 --> 19:30.633
Well, we certainly didn't see
any of that while we were there!

19:30.668 --> 19:31.635
And his wife's an absolute cutie.

19:32.629 --> 19:35.630
I think they're our favourite hosts.
If you don't count the Hitlers.

19:36.681 --> 19:38.647
You're good friends with the Hitlers?!

19:38.682 --> 19:41.553
It's just a social thing.
We don't talk about his work.

19:41.554 --> 19:43.604
We just have a few laughs, play canasta,

19:43.605 --> 19:46.680
and enjoy the odd game of
mixed doubles with the Goerings.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.643
I don't believe what I'm hearing!

19:49.678 --> 19:53.979
Look, you have to understand, we travel back
and forth throughout the whole of history,

19:53.980 --> 19:56.686
and naturally we want to
sample the best of everything.

19:56.687 --> 19:59.683
It's just a bit unfortunate
that the finest things tend to be

19:59.684 --> 20:02.678
in the possession of people who
are judged to be a bit dodgy.

20:02.713 --> 20:04.541
Herman Goering is a "bit dodgy"!

20:04.542 --> 20:08.105
What has become of you all?
You've all abandoned your morals,

20:08.106 --> 20:10.002
been seduced by power and wealth.

20:10.003 --> 20:13.679
All you're interested in now is
indulging your carnal desires.

20:13.714 --> 20:15.675
And could we tell you
some stories about _that_!

20:16.690 --> 20:20.653
I don't recognize any of you! You're
just amoral self-serving scum,

20:20.654 --> 20:22.689
freeloading your way through history!

20:23.691 --> 20:27.693
Good grief! I can't believe I used
to be such a stuck-up pompous prig.

20:31.692 --> 20:35.296
Okay. That's it. You've got two
minutes to get off this ship.

20:35.297 --> 20:37.099
I don't know how we became you,

20:37.100 --> 20:41.691
but I sure as hell don't intend to help
you carry on doing what you're doing.

20:41.726 --> 20:44.687
But we need to examine the calibration
on your time drive's maxic-factor.

20:45.687 --> 20:46.656
That's one minute forty.

20:46.691 --> 20:49.686
Shooting us would be like killing
himself in the future. He won't do it.

20:50.686 --> 20:52.657
What have I got to lose? I'm in a jar.

20:52.692 --> 20:54.687
Gentlemen, let's put an
end to this, why don't we?

20:55.687 --> 20:58.687
But without the calibration date, we'll be
stranded out here in the middle of nowhere.

20:58.722 --> 20:59.704
Fifty seconds.

20:59.739 --> 21:00.686
C'mon, let's go.

21:04.741 --> 21:06.745
You'll have changed your mind
when you've thought it through.

21:08.741 --> 21:09.740
Twenty seconds. Into the airlock and git.

21:23.743 --> 21:25.637
I knew it would be a
mistake to see the future.

21:25.638 --> 21:27.572
Now our whole lives will
be coloured by the fact

21:27.573 --> 21:29.742
that we're going to end up
becoming people we despise.

21:31.742 --> 21:34.740
Threat warning - vessel off the stern!
They've got a missile lock on us!

21:34.775 --> 21:35.738
Our future selves are attacking us!

21:36.739 --> 21:37.743
They're nuts!

21:38.738 --> 21:40.240
Direct hit! The gyroscope's out!

21:40.275 --> 21:41.743
They're trying to disable us!

21:41.778 --> 21:42.759
Another lock!

21:42.794 --> 21:43.705
Incoming message!

21:43.740 --> 21:48.429
Gentlemen, we have no intention of
being deprived of the opulence and luxury

21:48.430 --> 21:52.997
the time drive provides. Either you
give us access to the data we require,

21:52.998 --> 21:55.737
or be prepared to be
blasted out of the sky.

21:55.772 --> 21:57.704
But if you kill us,
you'll have cease to exist.

21:57.739 --> 22:03.001
Better that than to be forced to live
like you, like rats trapped together,

22:03.002 --> 22:06.739
marooned in deep space.
Your answer, thirty seconds.

22:06.774 --> 22:07.706
So what do we do?

22:07.741 --> 22:08.738
Have we got any chance of winning?

22:09.739 --> 22:12.735
Their craft is greatly upgraded.
We have no chance whatsoever.

22:12.770 --> 22:13.736
Then I say fight!

22:14.740 --> 22:15.705
Mr. Rimmer?

22:15.740 --> 22:16.735
Better dead than smeg!

22:17.736 --> 22:18.741
Cheers! Cat?

22:19.735 --> 22:21.738
Better dead than sofa-side butt.

22:22.738 --> 22:23.438
Kryten?

22:23.742 --> 22:24.737
Better anything than that toupee!

22:25.738 --> 22:26.734
Shields up! Arming lasers!

22:27.734 --> 22:28.734
Bringing her around.

22:28.769 --> 22:29.699
Target acquired!

22:29.734 --> 22:30.733
Locking on - firing!

22:31.733 --> 22:32.702
Direct hit!

22:32.737 --> 22:33.734
Starbug thrusters! Nice shooting, sir!

22:34.735 --> 22:35.699
Bringing her around to reserve.

22:35.734 --> 22:36.735
Threat warning! They've got a lock on us!

22:37.739 --> 22:38.741
I'm going for the main fuel tank!

22:38.776 --> 22:39.761
They're in your sight!

22:39.796 --> 22:40.747
Locked on - fire!

22:46.380 --> 22:47.678
- Mr. Lister!
- Is he okay?

22:48.384 --> 22:49.382
He's dead, sir!

22:50.387 --> 22:52.377
The hull's gonna go. We'll
all be dead in a minute.

22:56.638 --> 22:57.636
CAT!?

22:59.639 --> 23:01.637
..Dead... But there may be -

23:04.635 --> 23:09.284
Kryten?! There may be a
what? A way out of this?

23:09.285 --> 23:12.605
Is that what you were gonna say?...

23:12.606 --> 23:17.633
Speak, Kryten! How can we
change what's happening?!
