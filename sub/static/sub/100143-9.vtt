WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The sign of the snake has not been seen
for 10,000 years.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
Well, I'm back.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
Many have sworn allegiance
to the dark itself.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
-This is who we all are.
-We follow a demon.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
The child of the gods
will lead us into the light!

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
She's going to drive the Romans
back into the sea.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
We are facing a force that is
getting stronger with every day.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
-Where am I?
-Right in the middle of my prophecy!

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
This is the final task.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
-Hold on. It's a red hot crucible.
-It's the Trial of Fire.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Not the trial of
have-a-liedown-and-relax.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Thank you for saving me.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
-Stop showing off.
-I'm not.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
-You are. I can tell.
-I'm not.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
-There's someone I want you to find.
-You have no power over me.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
It was a massacre.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
It was the start of an alliance.
Without your darkest foes.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
You want the Druid.
I want the maiden.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Leave the girl to me.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
I'm going to have to fight someone.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Someone we can only fight
with a ruddy magic bow.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
-Who sent you here?
-The Dead Man.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
We'll destroy the Chosen One.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Oh. That's not so good.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
We need to go. He tried to kill me.
There's a demon in him. Come on!

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
-Wait!
-We don't need this. We don't need this.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
Girl. Girl. Girl!

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Footprints. Footprints.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
No footprints.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
No.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
She left it. She left it.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
It's the prophecy.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
I've failed. I've failed.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Oh, shit.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
When I look out my window

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Many sights to see

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
And when I look in my window

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
So many different people to be

04:02.000 --> 04:09.000
Oh, no
Must be the season of the witch

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Must be the season of the witch

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah
Must be the season of the witch

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
You've got to pick up every stitch

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
The rabbits running in the ditch

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
Beatniks are out to make it rich

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Any joy?

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Whatever I was,
I don't think it was a hunter.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Did you get me one?

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
What happened last night,
with your friend?

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
-He was never my friend.
-Then why were you with him?

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
That's a long story.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
You look different.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
-How?
-I don't know, your eyes...

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Like a weight's been lifted off you.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Whatever it was, you didn't need it.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
-I'm hungry.
-Yeah, me, too.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
-Where's the apple tree?
-Oh, fuck apples.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Let's find meat.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Apple trees grow meat.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
Why do you always talk in riddles?
Hey. Wait for me.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Shh. Wait.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Watch this.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Wow. You are...

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
..full of surprises.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Not now.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Trust me, Morrigan.
This is not the time...

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Unless you know how to get
my arse off this,

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
or know how to get to the Lake of Tears,
I suggest you don't get involved.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Thank you. I know very well
what Veran is going to do to me.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
Oh, you did, did you, all along?

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Well, aren't you the smart one?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Doesn't make sense.
Doesn't make sense.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
Veran blessed me.
I walk these forests in his protection.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
So something...

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
...something is as powerful,

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
or more powerful than Veran.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
But what?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Hey. Look at me.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Look at me.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
The Dead Man.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
The Dead Man sent him.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Where will you go now?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I don't know.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
You could go home.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
I don't have a home.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
-Not any more.
-Hey. I don't have a home, either.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
So we both have nowhere to go.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
It looks that way.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Maybe we could go nowhere together.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
What if I want to go nowhere
on my own?

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
You're going to get hungry.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
You are good at catching squirrels.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
And you're good for nothing.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
Good for nothing's good
when you're going nowhere.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
-Let's give it a day. See how it goes.
-All right, sounds fair.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Off. Get it off.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Get it off. Get it off!

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
I can't reach. Please, help me here.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Fuckin' help.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
She's going to tell him.
She's going to tell him everything.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
So, which way is nowhere?

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
North. West. South.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
s-How about east?
-Sounds about right.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
When you come into someone else's life,

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
do you interrupt theirs,
or do they interrupt yours?

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
I mean, whose path is it?

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I think, a bit of both.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Doesn't feel like that, does it?

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
Anyway, as I was saying,
before I was so rudely interrupted.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
I'm so sorry. Please continue.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
There's this prophecy...

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Yes.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Yes. Yes! Give it to me.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
Harder! Harder! Take it off!

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
Yeah!

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, don't stop!

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Don't stop! No! No!

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
No!

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Fuck it! Fuck it!

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
Oh, wonderful. Just beautiful.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Thank you, gods.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
The funny thing about
being the Chosen One

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
is that I have no choice in it.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
-Like your life wasn't your own.
-Exactly.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Yeah, I know that feeling.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
-So, what else can you do?
-What?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Tricks. You said he taught you stuff.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
-They're not tricks.
-No? What are they?

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
-I don't want to.
-Hey, listen, it's fine.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
If you can't really do them
and it's bullshit...

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Don't.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
You haven't upset me.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Are you sure?

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I'm a dick.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Where are you?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
All right.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
All right, that was good. I'm scared.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
-Where are you?
-Can you hear me?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Yes.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Why were you in the river?

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
I don't know.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I don't believe you.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Really?

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Maybe I was looking for something.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Did you find it?

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Did you?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
The maiden is under
the Dead Man's spell,

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
which, as you rightfully point out,
is a fucking disaster.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
And if that little twerp
was powerful enough to trick me...

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
..it's possible he's taking her
to the Lake of Tears,

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
not to be reborn, but to be fore born.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
What do you mean, what's the difference?
Why is everyone...

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
There's an obvious, huge difference.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
To be reborn is to be reborn.

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
To be fore born is to be sacrificed.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
What if this was always
supposed to happen?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
What if I was destined to fail?

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Would the gods do that to me?

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
You're right.
Of course, they fucking would.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Yep.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
No-one. What do you want?

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
-Nothing.
-Good.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
-Is something wrong?
-Nothing wrong. Everything's fine.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
-Do you have any food?
-No.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
What about the rabbit?

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
-The rabbit's a friend.
-Suit yourself.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
-Can I sit a while?
-No. I...

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
He's... This is... I'm his stump. No.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
-What's that?
-Nothing.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
-Looks like a golden bow.
-It's nothing of the sort.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
Quite possibly, if I've learned
anything on this journey,

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
-it's that nothing is how it seems.
-I'll try to remember that.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
Ah. I've been on a journey.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
It's been quite a trip.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
-Whenever I think of getting anywhere...
-You enjoying this?

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
-Do you have kids?
-I've never even had sex.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
I have two sons.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
One called Phelan, after me.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
Another called Rolf, after me.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
I'm going to speak plainly here
so listen very carefully.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
I don't care you who are, where you're
going, how many children you have.

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
Right now, I have bigger fish to fry.
So, happy travels.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
-Atonement.
-Come again?

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Atonement.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
That's where I'm headed.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
Oh.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
-Why didn't you say? It's that way.
-Yeah.

18:23.000 --> 18:29.000
-Oh. Thank you, friend.
-Don't mention it.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
Hope is the daughter of a blind father.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Fuck. Come back.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Come back! Come back!

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
No! Shit.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Fucking shit!

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
How about this?

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I guess it's good as anywhere.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
-Or nowhere.
-I like it.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
It's a castle. It's got walls.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
-It's got turrets.
-Passageways.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
-A very big boat.
-Fire.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
-Fit for a king.
-It's fit for a queen.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
The King and Queen of Nowhere.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
-Good evening, Your Majesty.
-Highness.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
-Oh, I'm so sorry. I...
-Good evening...

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
..Your Highness.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
-I'm hungry.
-Yeah, me, too.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
-Fetch wood.
-I've got a better idea. You fetch wood.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
-No, no, your Majesty.
-Highness.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
No, no, Your Highness. I've got this.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
-This should be good.
-Just light a fire, darlin'.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
I've got it. Oh.

20:47.000 --> 20:52.000
I don't know where The Lake of Tears is,
but I know someone who does.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
No, no, no, no, no.
This is a terrible idea.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Terrible idea. No.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
I have no choice.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Forgive me, gods.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
How did you do that?

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
I have no fuckin' idea...

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
...Your Highness.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
-You were a fisherman.
-Yeah, maybe I was.

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
-Can you show me?
-I don't know. I can try.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
I think you do, what I do is,
you watch the water

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
and then you see
if you can spot any shadows.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
See, there, this one coming.
See, there, there.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
-Now.
-Piss off.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
He has pissed off. Let's go again.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
-Put your hands in.
-There.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
This is dangerous. Oh, look.
Okay, let's do it again.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
What's wrong?

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
Hey. You've gone pale.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
-I felt something.
-What?

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
I'm not sure. Horrible feeling.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
-It's gone. It's gone now.
-Do you want to sit down?

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
I'm fine.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
You know, it doesn't work like that.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
I remember something.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
A small cottage by the sea.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
-It's full of people that look like...
-Like what?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Me.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
It sounds like my home,
but it was yours.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
You were a fisherman.
You lived by the sea with your family.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
It's coming back.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
I just remembered something, too.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
A feeling.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
One I haven't felt for a very long time.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
-What's that?
-Not afraid.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
Of all the things I expected to see.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
The Guardian summoning Pwykka.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
This is embarrassing enough, Quane.
Don't rub it in.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
I never knew that's what I was.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
-What?
-The Guardian.

25:34.000 --> 25:39.000
I never knew I had a title in all this.
I didn't know I'm the Guardian.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
You were the Guardian.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
I worked my nuts off, Quane.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
Day and night for 25 moons.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
Ask anyone. Ask him. Morrigan. Morrigan.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
Morrigan, tell him. Tell...
Fucking fuck.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Listen to me, boy.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
The Dead Man and Lokka
have joined forces.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
Together, they seek to destroy
all those left loyal to Veran.

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
If the Dead Man wins, our time is over.

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
-Will Veran not fight?
-Veran is already greatly weakened.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
Now that you have failed him, who knows?

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
-I must leave you now.
-You can't leave me here.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
Once, you were a fine student,

26:31.000 --> 26:36.000
you could feel the wind,
sing the songs of the stars.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
There was a fire in your eyes.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
I felt that, you, my boy,

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
you might one day become the Veran.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
-Me?
-Veran felt it also.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
He told me once. He said,

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
"That boy will one day lead us."

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Veran said that?

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
But then Pwykka came.

27:02.000 --> 27:07.000
Since then, you've been adrift.
Veran loved you.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
That's why he gave you one last chance.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
And you failed.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Wait. Quane.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Wait.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
Quane!

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
I know what happens next.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
The eagle does not devour the maiden.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
It carries the maiden in its claws

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
to the Lake of Tears,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
where she will be...

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Where she will be what?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Reborn.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
There's a problem.
We don't know where the lake is.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
I'm not done, Quane! I'm not done!

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
You don't give up, do you?

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
But after what's next,
you might wish you had.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Where I am about to send you,

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
you need to be stronger
than you know.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
I've been to the Underworld.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
This isn't the Underworld.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
This journey is upward.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Sun Mushrooms.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Dog Moss.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
-Ooh.
-A badger's heart.

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
-What's that?
-Powdered Time.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
Oh, I love thyme.
I like to do bread with thyme.

29:00.000 --> 29:05.000
-Or beef.
-No, my boy. Time.

29:08.000 --> 29:13.000
This is your last chance
to prove you are the Guardian.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
No, I don't feel it. Sorry.
Doesn't work for me.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
What the...

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
Quane! Quane!

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Have you noticed how you mess
most things up?

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
-That's why I was there.
-Where?

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
In the river. When you found me.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
That's what I was there to do.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
-What?
-Mess things up.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
What do you mean?

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
I didn't fall in the river.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
I wasn't pushed.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
I jumped in. I did it myself.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
So that I could find you.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Why did you want to find me?

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
I told you.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
To mess things up.
I came to spoil things.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
Lead you astray.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
-This isn't you.
-Oh.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
It's me.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
-It's me, all right.
-You're not doing this.

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
-You didn't choose this.
-But did you choose this?

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Or is it where I want you to be?

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
Into the arms...

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
..of the eagle.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
Where are you?

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Let's play a game.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
I love games.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
It's all right.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
It's all right. It's all right.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
It's all right.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
It's all right. It's all right.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
It's all right.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
-What happened?
-It's all right.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
-What happened?
-It's all right.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
What the fuck happened?

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Good morning.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
-Good morning.
-How do you feel?

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
It feels like a dream.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
That's what it was. A dream.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
I'm a fisherman's son.

34:30.000 --> 34:35.000
I have two brothers,
and we live in the east, by the sea.

34:38.000 --> 34:43.000
We go out in the mornings
on a small boat, before the sun rises,

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
and we catch silverheads.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
A man came with long...

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
He took us to another man...

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
..with dark eyes.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
My brothers.
I don't know where they went.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
I just remembered something else.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
What?

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
My name.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
My name is Mallin.

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
-My name is Cait.
-Hello, Cait.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
Hello, Mallin.

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
-I'm a fisherman.
-I told you.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
It's so strange.
I'd forgotten what it felt like to...

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
What felt like?

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
What it felt like to just be...

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
...me.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
I'm me.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Hey. What's wrong?

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Nothing.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
I'm just happy for you.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
I'm me. I'm me.

36:47.000 --> 36:51.000
I can do what I want. Thank you.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
I can throw this rock in that lake.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
I feel so free.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
I'm free.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Is that all right?

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Yes.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
I don't know what you did.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
I have no idea what you did,
but thank you.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Thank you.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Thank you.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
That's going to take forever.
You've got a lot of layers.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
The Guardian. The Guardian.

39:08.000 --> 39:13.000
Hi. I'm the Guardian
with the Golden Bow.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
I'm free.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Islene, can you hear me?

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
You were right.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
It's amazing.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Islene, what should I do?

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Hello.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
It's you.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
How did you find me?

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
Where are my brothers?

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
I'm so sorry.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
-Mallin?
-Help me.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Mallin! Mallin!

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
No!

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
I have atoned.
