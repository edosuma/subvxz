00:02.280 --> 00:04.681
My name is Oliver Queen.

00:04.880 --> 00:08.965
After five years in hell,
I have come home with only one goal:

00:09.160 --> 00:11.208
To save my city.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.363
Now others have joined my crusade.

00:13.560 --> 00:16.085
To them I am Oliver Queen.

00:16.320 --> 00:19.244
To the rest of Starling City,
lam someone else...

00:19.440 --> 00:22.808
...I am something else.

00:23.040 --> 00:24.530
Previously on Arrow:

00:25.600 --> 00:27.125
What are you doing here?

00:30.960 --> 00:33.247
Whoever did this, I'm gonna find them.

00:33.440 --> 00:35.807
- There's another bidder for the company.
- Who?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.731
Ray Palmer. Yes, I am your boss now.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.564
No!

00:42.000 --> 00:44.924
Roy, I don't trust you. Or anyone.

00:45.120 --> 00:48.329
Don't try to find me. I
am never coming back.

00:48.560 --> 00:49.925
Now I gotta go get Thea.

00:50.120 --> 00:52.088
Long past time she came home.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.764
Well done.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.570
Thanks, Dad.

01:19.040 --> 01:21.520
So where are we going?

01:21.760 --> 01:22.921
Wherever you want.

01:23.120 --> 01:26.124
- It's up to me?
- Why not?

01:26.320 --> 01:29.005
I'm the well-traveled man,
been every place in the world.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.362
But you wanna get out of here...

01:31.560 --> 01:34.803
...because if the police knew
you were alive, they'd come after you.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.684
The Arrow too.

01:38.120 --> 01:40.441
You're very perceptive, Thea.

01:40.920 --> 01:45.164
Knowing when people are hiding something behind
their smiles. Your mother had that talent.

01:46.560 --> 01:48.050
Yes.

01:48.240 --> 01:52.040
If someone knew where I was,
it would be unfortunate.

01:52.240 --> 01:53.571
For both of us.

01:57.040 --> 01:58.929
So why did you reach out to me?

01:59.120 --> 02:01.805
- You reached first.
- But still.

02:02.920 --> 02:06.288
I don't want to feel this pain again.

02:07.120 --> 02:10.602
I don't wanna hurt or get hurt.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.928
Never again.

02:14.640 --> 02:18.122
And you seem like someone
who can teach me how not to.

02:50.680 --> 02:53.843
A woman was killed on a rooftop
last week. Black leather, blond hair.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.610
- Wore a mask.
- I didn't kill her.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.326
- You were there.
- I don't know anything about it.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.124
Your fingerprints are on this.

03:00.360 --> 03:03.170
- From a fifth I drank up there, but I...
- What did you see?

03:03.360 --> 03:04.407
Nothing.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.443
I was up on the roof with some buddies.

03:06.640 --> 03:09.325
This lady, she showed up
and she told us to go.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.602
Looked like she could handle herself.

03:13.800 --> 03:16.883
Whoever it is you're looking for,
I wouldn't wanna be him.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.970
Another dead end.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.481
It took me a week to get
a hit off that print.

03:24.720 --> 03:28.008
I had to reconstruct the partial
using a predictive indexing algorithm.

03:28.200 --> 03:31.249
Appropriate since it was his index finger.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.924
Not particularly relevant now.

03:36.120 --> 03:37.804
Don't worry, Oliver. We'll find him.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.651
- He's out there somewhere.
- No, he's not.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.446
Trail's gone cold.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.927
I hate to do this but I
have to head off to work.

03:45.320 --> 03:48.005
- Tech Village is open this early?
- Not exactly.

03:48.360 --> 03:52.126
- Have you figured out where in Italy Thea is?
- About that, she's not in Italy.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.800
Or Europe. Or... Well, she's...

03:55.040 --> 03:56.087
Where is she?

03:56.280 --> 04:00.205
I had to ping her cell phone to find out
where in "ltaly" she was texting from.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.609
Turns out, came back Corto Maltese.

04:04.520 --> 04:08.206
C0rto's an island off of South America.
What's up with your family and islands?

04:09.960 --> 04:11.803
Hey, Oliver.

04:12.480 --> 04:17.406
- Thea's letter said not to come find her.
- That letter was addressed to you, not to me.

04:17.600 --> 04:22.606
I'm watching Laurel
go through losing Sara.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.289
It's time for my sister to come home.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.846
- What are you doing?
- Thea's gone because of me.

04:35.080 --> 04:38.527
Because of lies I told her. I owe this
to both of you to make things right.

04:38.720 --> 04:42.520
No. What are you doing?

04:42.760 --> 04:44.330
You can't travel with that.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.691
I've actually never been on a plane before.

04:54.960 --> 04:59.090
I know. You're not doing anything
and I could literally watch you forever.

04:59.280 --> 05:03.649
Oh, yeah?
What about once she discovers boys?

05:04.240 --> 05:06.402
Well, that's what my Glock is for.
Right, baby?

05:06.600 --> 05:08.443
Right. That's my Glock.

05:17.440 --> 05:20.603
I'm gonna enjoy some quality time
with her for the next few days.

05:20.840 --> 05:23.161
I'm even looking forward
to changing a few diapers.

05:23.360 --> 05:26.648
And I'm looking forward to
believing that when I see it.

05:28.440 --> 05:30.363
Why the time off?

05:30.600 --> 05:31.931
You quit the team again?

05:32.120 --> 05:35.966
No, Oliver's going to Corto Maltese
for a couple of days.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.003
Could you go with him?

05:40.200 --> 05:43.204
Like I don't already spend
enough time with Oliver as it is?

05:43.440 --> 05:46.284
Team Arrow may have
Starling City purring like a kitten...

05:46.480 --> 05:50.041
...but the rest of the world
is still a very dangerous place.

05:50.280 --> 05:53.921
- Including Corto Maltese.
- I already don't like where this is headed.

05:54.160 --> 05:58.006
- We have an operative there who's gone dark.
- All right, so send an agent.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.646
- Send a task force.
- He's not in any kind of trouble.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.689
He hasn't touched his panic button.

06:02.920 --> 06:05.366
He's probably just drunk
in some belleza's villa.

06:05.560 --> 06:08.245
Mark Shaw has been known
to miss days from time to time.

06:10.680 --> 06:13.001
Will you just do me a favor...

06:13.200 --> 06:15.043
...and see if he's okay?

06:15.240 --> 06:18.608
Tell him to check in. Two more days
and I have to call the cavalry...

06:18.800 --> 06:21.406
...and I don't want him
to get into trouble with Waller.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.921
Mark's an old friend.

06:26.760 --> 06:29.411
She better not do anything
interesting while I'm gone.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.330
Next time keep your hands up.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.526
Ted Grant.

06:49.360 --> 06:52.204
That badge means
you're not here for a self-defense class.

06:52.400 --> 06:55.961
No, I've had my fair share. I'm here about
one of your students, Tom Bronson.

06:56.160 --> 06:59.243
A witness places him
at the scene of a break-in last night.

06:59.480 --> 07:03.280
Well, that's not possible. See, because
Tom and I were sparring last night.

07:03.520 --> 07:07.366
Mr. Grant, do you know that lying to the
district attorney is against the law?

07:07.560 --> 07:10.291
You mean am I willing to lie
in order to keep a good kid...

07:10.480 --> 07:13.324
...who happened to make
a stupid mistake out of the system...

07:13.520 --> 07:15.045
...I think you know my answer.

07:15.280 --> 07:17.248
Are you admitting to perjury, Mr. Grant?

07:19.200 --> 07:21.282
Now that's a big word.

07:21.480 --> 07:23.164
I'm just a dumb fighter.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.771
Right?

07:25.000 --> 07:28.721
Look, Tom was here with me last night.
We worked on his uppercut combinations.

07:28.960 --> 07:32.931
Like I said, in this city there's a lot
of good people who get dealt bad hands.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.966
They lose someone, they lose themselves.
They come in here to work off that rage.

07:37.160 --> 07:41.165
I've gotten good at picking out the types.
Types just like you.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.840
If I'm angry it's because
I'm dealing with someone...

07:44.040 --> 07:46.122
...who's willing to lie
to protect a punk kid.

07:46.360 --> 07:47.805
I don't think that's the case.

07:49.440 --> 07:50.566
Either way...

07:51.600 --> 07:54.080
...if you do have something
you wanna work off...

08:15.000 --> 08:16.365
So, what's the play with Thea?

08:16.560 --> 08:19.370
Do you mind if I talk to her
alone first? It's been a while.

08:20.680 --> 08:24.526
- Felicity able to pin her down?
- She gave me an address.

08:40.480 --> 08:42.244
Thea!

08:50.600 --> 08:52.364
You must be Mia's brother.

08:52.560 --> 08:55.723
- I see the resemblance.
- ls Mia around?

08:55.920 --> 08:59.242
- She works at the cafe.
- Where's the cafe?

08:59.440 --> 09:01.249
- I'll show you.
- Thank you.

09:12.480 --> 09:16.246
I didn't come all the way to South America
to have you poison me, did I?

09:18.520 --> 09:20.761
It's a meditative tea.

09:20.960 --> 09:24.851
It will activate your mind and body.

09:25.360 --> 09:29.365
I think I'm gonna need a little bit more
than tea to learn how to use one of those.

09:30.440 --> 09:33.330
The Sohei Buddhist warriors
believed that first...

09:33.520 --> 09:35.568
...you must fight with the mind...

09:35.800 --> 09:37.450
...then your sword.

09:39.320 --> 09:42.005
I remember when I was...

09:42.200 --> 09:45.090
...training to be a warrior
I began just like you.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.282
Devastated by my wife's death.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.205
I was ar19FY...

09:50.440 --> 09:51.726
...and hurt.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.366
The pain was unbearable.

10:05.760 --> 10:07.524
Like this.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.487
You're out of your mind.
Put your hand in here.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.889
Every warrior must learn the simple truth.

10:16.080 --> 10:20.404
That pain is inevitable
and suffering is optional.

10:22.360 --> 10:25.045
Please, don't... Don't do
what I think you're gonna do.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.848
You asked me to teach you.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.046
No.

10:45.920 --> 10:47.490
Thea?

10:52.480 --> 10:54.164
Good to see you.

10:54.360 --> 10:57.170
You too, but how did you...?

10:57.360 --> 11:00.284
Well, it's not exactly the Amalfi Coast.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.801
Didn't you flunk Spanish?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.321
More like skipped it altogether.

11:10.280 --> 11:11.327
You look good.

11:12.320 --> 11:13.765
I like your haircut.

11:13.960 --> 11:15.644
Thank you. Yeah.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.525
Wanted it short, you know.
Gets hot down here.

11:20.760 --> 11:24.845
I'm sorry I lied to you about Italy.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.202
I just needed some space.

11:27.400 --> 11:30.404
It's okay. You've had five months of it.

11:31.880 --> 11:34.611
This isn't just a visit.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.808
Got one for you too.

11:41.960 --> 11:45.567
After Mom, I understood
why you left Starling.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.604
But, Thea, I miss you.

11:53.560 --> 11:57.087
And I would really like
it if you came home.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.521
I miss you too.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.368
And I love you.

12:02.560 --> 12:07.248
So much. But I'm never
coming back to Starling City.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.761
I can't. I'm sorry.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.849
There is strength in you, Thea.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.281
I see it, even if you
can't see it yourself.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.290
I'm sorry, this...

12:29.480 --> 12:33.849
This just isn't me.
I'm not like you. I can't do this.

12:34.640 --> 12:36.324
It's all right.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.807
It's not your fault.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.450
It's mine.

12:43.560 --> 12:47.929
QC stock up 1O bucks
at the open. That is love. Ha.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.367
Ah, Ms. Smoak. Good morning.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.244
I think. I've been here all night.

12:52.440 --> 12:55.410
My predecessor left things, um...
What's the polite way to say this?

12:55.600 --> 12:56.761
A little wonky.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.163
Sorry if I'm rambling. I'm a little
over-caffeinated. I just had three espressos.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.044
- Speaking of coffee...
- Let me stop you.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.971
I told myself that I would
stand firm on a few points.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.447
No late-night emails. No personal errands.

13:07.680 --> 13:12.527
And definitely no coffee. There'll be
no espressos brought to you by me.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.966
I stand very firm on that last point.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.604
And I admire your conviction.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.326
This is Gerry Conway,
your executive assistant...

13:22.520 --> 13:25.649
...and I wanted to know
if you'd like him to get you a coffee.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.649
Or are you just anti-latte in general?

13:27.840 --> 13:29.251
Um...

13:29.840 --> 13:32.002
Executive assistant?

13:32.240 --> 13:34.641
I think that's a yes on the latte.

13:35.720 --> 13:37.802
- Thank you, Gerry.
- Thank you, Gerry.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.930
Shall we get to work?
Excellent. Applied Sciences.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.930
Bleeding edge research division
until some wacko blew it up.

13:44.120 --> 13:47.203
- I'm sure they had their reasons.
- The point is...

13:47.400 --> 13:50.131
...it's the cornerstone for my plan
to rebuild Queen Consolidated...

13:50.320 --> 13:51.401
...and thus, the city.

13:51.640 --> 13:55.361
I've had my people working day and night
salvaging what they can, including this.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.365
The file server containing
Applied Sciences' design work.

13:58.600 --> 14:02.127
It's not working, on account
of being caught in a massive explosion.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.089
You want me to access the data.

14:04.320 --> 14:08.245
Brilliant mind at work already.
Speaking of, I gotta get back to work.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.920
Then why are you leaving your office?

14:11.160 --> 14:14.289
I'm not. I'm leaving yours.

14:25.520 --> 14:28.091
This is Lyla's busywork.
You didn't have to tag along.

14:28.280 --> 14:31.363
Well, I don't know how to vacation
like a normal person, Diggle.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.961
- What's the plan?
- This spot's his usual dead drop.

14:34.160 --> 14:37.687
Lyla sent me over this file photo.
Just gonna make sure he's all right.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.887
- Got him.
- I got you.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.730
He's a friendly, Oliver.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.769
Shaw.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.008
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.288
Listen, I'm with Lyla Michaels.

14:56.920 --> 14:58.524
Have you seen any capuchins today?

14:58.720 --> 15:02.008
If that's a code, I'm not with A.R.G.U.S.
I'm just Lyla's baby daddy.

15:02.200 --> 15:05.488
You didn't check in, Shaw.
She was worried so she sent me to find you.

15:05.680 --> 15:08.809
You're lying, you'll be picking
your intestines off this sidewalk.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.764
That's fair enough.

15:14.320 --> 15:18.166
Lyla gave me a security transcoder
in my right jacket pocket.

15:27.080 --> 15:31.005
- You're prettyjumpy, Shaw.
- Better jumpy than dead.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.651
Copy that. What's going on?

15:32.840 --> 15:34.888
Not here.

15:38.640 --> 15:40.051
Sorry, I had...

15:40.240 --> 15:42.846
I had eyes on me all week.
A whole follow team.

15:43.080 --> 15:45.526
Wait, Shaw. What makes you so important?

15:45.720 --> 15:47.404
I have hard intel.

15:47.600 --> 15:51.321
Someone hacked into the server,
acquired the A.R.G.U.S. Actual.

15:51.520 --> 15:54.046
- They wanna sell it.
- I don't work for A.R.G.U.S.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.208
The Actual is an encrypted data omnibus.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.529
It's a complete record
of agent covers, personal details...

15:59.720 --> 16:02.610
...affiliated soft targets.
Whoa, soft targets.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.006
As in family members?

16:04.200 --> 16:06.567
Yeah, as in women and children.

16:06.760 --> 16:09.366
You get why this is so important?

16:10.640 --> 16:12.608
Hi, my name is Laurel. I'm an alcoholic.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.450
Hi, Laurel.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.881
A week ago l...

16:18.960 --> 16:21.042
Something happened.

16:22.040 --> 16:25.487
Something that I can't
share with anyone for...

16:25.680 --> 16:28.206
...several complicated reasons.

16:31.520 --> 16:34.842
I thought that I was gonna want a drink.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.040
But I didn't.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.766
Not even tempted, really.

16:42.040 --> 16:44.725
But what I am is...

16:45.800 --> 16:47.086
...I'm afigrY-

16:48.000 --> 16:50.810
And I don't know what to do with it...

16:51.000 --> 16:52.604
...or where to put it, I just...

16:59.160 --> 17:01.208
Thank you for letting me share.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.211
Are there any other burning desires?

17:09.079 --> 17:12.402
- Erica. Alcoholic.
- Hi, Erica.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.645
My boyfriend and me
got into another fight last night.

17:15.880 --> 17:19.167
Some of you know he still drinks a lot...

17:19.359 --> 17:21.567
...and I said something.

17:23.520 --> 17:26.490
I know I should have
just kept my mouth shut.

17:27.359 --> 17:29.761
I know I should just leave him, but...

17:29.960 --> 17:31.849
...I can't.

17:32.480 --> 17:35.689
Maybe there's a meeting
I should be going to for that.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.247
Once a month Erica gives a share like that.

17:38.440 --> 17:39.805
- It's getting worse.
- Yeah.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.606
The boyfriend has eight assault
charges against him.

17:42.800 --> 17:46.043
Not just Starling. He's got warrants
out on him as far as Coast City.

17:46.240 --> 17:48.766
It takes everything in me
not to go after the dirt bag.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.924
The day the cops start bringing
their badges into AA meetings...

17:52.120 --> 17:54.566
...that's the day that
the drunks stop coming.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.247
I'm in position.

18:02.440 --> 18:05.046
That sale of the Actual is going down here.

18:05.240 --> 18:08.767
Only two of us?
You sure you don't wanna call for back-up?

18:08.960 --> 18:10.166
H9)'-

18:10.400 --> 18:12.846
That's the only insurance policy
you're gonna need.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.287
We're here.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.607
You're not worried
about them seeing our ride?

18:26.680 --> 18:28.762
How'd you know the buy
was happening tonight?

18:29.000 --> 18:32.561
I've been the station agent
in Corto Maltese for three years now.

18:32.760 --> 18:35.081
I got this third-world garbage dump wired.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.570
What's wrong?

18:41.960 --> 18:43.769
There's no buy, is there, Shaw?

18:49.200 --> 18:50.964
Oliver, go! Go!

19:02.800 --> 19:04.370
Sorry for lying to you, John.

19:04.560 --> 19:08.281
Well, partially lying. There is a buy
going down, just not until tomorrow.

19:08.480 --> 19:09.811
I needed to get this first.

19:11.080 --> 19:13.082
Thanks for helping me decode the Actual.

19:14.280 --> 19:15.361
Diggle!

19:36.560 --> 19:39.040
Should have got the heavy-duty ones.

19:39.280 --> 19:40.884
I like your hair.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.845
What, are you and my brother,
like, travel buddies now?

19:45.400 --> 19:47.801
No, we're just worried about you.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.606
Oliver said you weren't
gonna come back, so...

19:53.800 --> 19:56.167
...I figured I'd come here
and try to convince you.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.567
- Well, you can't.
- Look, I get it. You're hurt.

19:59.120 --> 20:02.442
I lied to you. I lied right to your face.
But I need you to know...

20:02.640 --> 20:06.122
...that when I said I wanted to leave
Starling with you, that wasn't a lie.

20:06.320 --> 20:09.802
I didn't just leave because of you, Roy.

20:10.960 --> 20:14.806
My mother lied to me. My brother.

20:15.720 --> 20:18.690
I had to get away from
Starling City and all the secrets.

20:19.840 --> 20:22.286
And I found myself here.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.447
Isn't it lonely here?

20:24.800 --> 20:27.406
That's kind of what I like about it.

20:28.600 --> 20:31.206
There's no one here who knows me...

20:31.400 --> 20:35.724
...or thinks of me
as Thea Queen or Thea Merlyn.

20:37.760 --> 20:40.240
No one who lies to me or...

20:40.440 --> 20:42.488
...tries to protect me with secrets.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.287
All I ever wanted
was for you to be happy, Thea.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.881
I'm sorry I got in the way of that...

20:49.080 --> 20:51.367
...and I'm sorry that I hurt you.

20:52.360 --> 20:55.125
If being here instead of home
makes you happy...

20:55.320 --> 20:56.526
...then you should stay.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.524
Roy?

21:04.760 --> 21:06.728
Are you okay?

21:07.280 --> 21:09.203
You look a little tired.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.083
I just haven't been sleeping much lately.

21:13.160 --> 21:14.969
You take care.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.208
But what do you mean?

21:32.400 --> 21:35.210
It's not your fault, it's mine.

21:37.520 --> 21:40.251
I thought I could do this
differently, but I can't.

21:40.480 --> 21:43.689
I need to train you as I was trained.

21:44.520 --> 21:47.091
Treat you as my student,
not my daughter.

21:50.880 --> 21:52.848
What are you doing?

21:55.080 --> 21:57.447
The way to forge steel
is to temper it with fire.

22:00.640 --> 22:03.041
Stay away from me, you sick son of a bitch.

22:05.440 --> 22:06.487
Now we can begin.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.047
Why didn't you call me sooner?
I could've helped.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.766
Didn't want you to worry.
I thought we could handle it.

22:13.960 --> 22:17.248
We've hacked his email.
He's got a buyer en route to Con'o Maltese.

22:17.480 --> 22:19.801
- Who?
- The tech boys are still working on that.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.048
But Wailer's dispatched a wet team.

22:22.240 --> 22:26.211
- They're not gonna get here in time.
- They might. Keep your powder dry.

22:26.440 --> 22:27.885
Copy that.

22:30.960 --> 22:34.123
- We're not gonna keep our powder dry.
- Hell, no.

22:38.720 --> 22:42.088
Hey. Any luck raising
our digital Lazarus from the dead?

22:42.280 --> 22:43.770
The hard drive is toast.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.365
And the power supply.

22:45.560 --> 22:49.121
- And the actuator.
- I'm sensing a pattern.

22:50.840 --> 22:53.002
Sorry. One second.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.043
- Hello?
- Hey, Felicity. This is John.

22:57.240 --> 23:00.084
- Where are you?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.805
- You near a computer?
- Kind of.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.607
- I'm looking for somebody in Corto Maltese.
- I'm in the middle of a...

23:05.800 --> 23:08.371
I need to know where he is.
I've emailed you everything.

23:08.560 --> 23:10.562
Meeting right now.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.842
I am so sorry. It's a friend.

23:13.040 --> 23:14.963
Um, well, a few friends...

23:15.200 --> 23:18.249
...actually. You know what?
It's a long story.

23:18.440 --> 23:22.570
Heh. Why am I under the impression that you
have a lot of stories, all of which are long?

23:24.040 --> 23:27.123
- You want me to come back later?
- What? Sorry.

23:27.320 --> 23:29.641
- Hello?
- Felicity, I need a favor.

23:29.880 --> 23:33.043
Are we favor-friends now?
Are we friends?

23:33.240 --> 23:34.287
- What?
- Never mind. Sorry.

23:35.760 --> 23:38.445
Oh, dear God. One second.
One more second. Hello?

23:38.680 --> 23:39.761
We got cut off.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.964
According to the file you sent me,
this guy is a hacker.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.288
Let me guess. Long story?

23:45.520 --> 23:47.648
The guy I'm looking for
broke into A.R.G.U.S.

23:47.840 --> 23:51.083
He left a trail. It's faint, hacking-wise,
but with a bit of luck...

23:51.320 --> 23:55.564
...I will find him. Or his laptop.
I will email you when I have something.

23:56.640 --> 23:58.005
I'm having a bit of a day.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.527
I need you to find someone
by Googling his phone.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.449
Pinging his GPS.

24:03.520 --> 24:07.491
- Can I call you back?
- Is this what a typical day looks like for you?

24:07.680 --> 24:11.127
Believe it or not,
this is better than most.

24:11.320 --> 24:14.483
When Felicity has Shaw's location,
text me and I'll be there.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.245
- Thea?
- Yeah.

24:16.440 --> 24:18.727
I don't think she's gonna
change her mind on this.

24:18.920 --> 24:23.323
She doesn't wanna hear from anyone and I
don't blame her. We both lied to her, a lot.

24:23.560 --> 24:26.848
- It's why it's time to tell her the truth.
- When you say the truth...

24:27.040 --> 24:31.284
What happened the five years I was away.
Everything we've done since I've been back.

24:31.480 --> 24:33.801
- All of it.
- You might wanna think about that.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.243
Lies are what drove Thea away
from Starling City. The truth...

24:37.440 --> 24:41.365
...is the only thing that will bring her back.
- You won't be telling her the truth.

24:41.560 --> 24:45.007
You'll be telling her that her brother
has been lying to her to her face...

24:45.200 --> 24:48.090
...with almost pathological sincerity
for the past two years.

24:48.280 --> 24:52.569
She won't believe another word you say,
and you will lose her, Oliver, forever.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.722
Oh, look around.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.323
I've already lost her.

24:59.160 --> 25:01.527
I don't have any other choice.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.209
I hear you like to hit women.
How about one who likes to hit back?

25:30.680 --> 25:33.968
You're right. It's better
when they hit back.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.484
On. Baby.

25:52.680 --> 25:54.842
Baby. Baby, you okay?

25:55.040 --> 25:57.407
I'm so sorry.

25:57.600 --> 26:01.207
I'm too relieved to be mad at you.
I really am.

26:02.120 --> 26:04.043
But, sweetheart...

26:05.600 --> 26:07.250
...this is crazy.

26:07.440 --> 26:10.887
What the hell were you thinking
going after that girl's boyfriend?

26:11.080 --> 26:13.321
There's just something
I needed to work out.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.442
I know that the world isn't fair.

26:16.640 --> 26:20.008
I know that it's a terrible place...

26:21.160 --> 26:24.164
...where people deserve to get punished...

26:24.360 --> 26:27.648
...and they don't. I just...

26:31.000 --> 26:34.925
For one night,
I needed the world to be different.

26:35.120 --> 26:37.088
Okay, Laurel.

26:37.320 --> 26:40.403
Laurel,
what's going on with you, huh?

26:40.600 --> 26:42.807
You're not being yourself lately.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.447
Now you're running around, you're
tuning this guy up. What are you doing?

26:47.320 --> 26:51.166
Baby, you could talk to me about anything,
you know that, right? You know it.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.724
I know.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.804
Talk to me then.

27:12.920 --> 27:15.366
Laurel, you're not the Arrow.

27:15.560 --> 27:17.005
Or your sister.

27:20.040 --> 27:22.771
Promise me you'll never
do anything like this again, ever.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.529
Promise.

27:27.640 --> 27:29.802
It was a mistake. I wasn't thinking.

27:41.840 --> 27:45.731
You wanna stay in Corto Maltese, fine,
but there's not much here in sightseeing.

27:45.920 --> 27:47.365
May I talk to you?

27:47.600 --> 27:49.921
Look, between you
and your new best friend Roy...

27:50.120 --> 27:53.727
...I'm pretty sure you guys have said everything.
- I haven't.

27:53.920 --> 27:56.127
Not yet, anyway.

28:00.800 --> 28:03.724
Roy showed me the note you left him.

28:03.920 --> 28:07.686
And you were right about everything.
I've lied. I have kept secrets.

28:08.560 --> 28:12.531
The truth is that if I tell you...

28:12.720 --> 28:15.166
...all the things that you
don't know about me...

28:15.360 --> 28:18.409
...then I might lose you forever.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.443
I spent five years...

28:20.640 --> 28:25.168
...in the worst kind of hell
and there were things that happened...

28:25.360 --> 28:27.840
...there were things that I did...

28:29.840 --> 28:31.410
...that if...

28:32.920 --> 28:35.685
If you knew, you would see me differently.

28:35.880 --> 28:39.362
No, I'll always see you as my big brother.

28:39.560 --> 28:44.202
I mean, no matter
what happened to you on that island...

28:44.400 --> 28:46.323
...or who you became.

28:46.520 --> 28:51.321
It's the secrets you
kept about my own life.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.045
I mean, you...

28:55.240 --> 28:58.642
You lied to me about who my father was.

29:03.160 --> 29:05.686
Malcolm may have been your blood.

29:07.200 --> 29:08.850
Robert was your father.

29:13.840 --> 29:15.808
I lied to you about him too.

29:17.040 --> 29:18.963
Dad wasn't the man we thought he was.

29:19.920 --> 29:21.968
He was better.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.402
And I've kept something
from you because I just...

29:29.200 --> 29:30.804
I never wanted you to know.

29:34.280 --> 29:36.248
Dad made it off the Gambit with me.

29:37.760 --> 29:39.569
You told me he drowned.

29:40.280 --> 29:43.204
We made it to a lifeboat together...

29:43.400 --> 29:46.244
...but there wasn't enough
food or water for both of us...

29:49.200 --> 29:50.486
...so he killed himself.

29:54.800 --> 29:58.122
And that is one secret
that I'm telling you now...

29:58.320 --> 30:01.290
...because I need you to realize...

30:01.920 --> 30:04.571
...Mom and Dad...

30:04.760 --> 30:07.206
...they sacrificed themselves...

30:07.400 --> 30:09.368
...so that we could live.

30:10.480 --> 30:13.165
But if we're not together, then...

30:13.360 --> 30:15.567
...we're not even really alive.

30:16.840 --> 30:18.808
You are my family...

30:19.040 --> 30:20.929
...and even if you don't need me...

30:23.240 --> 30:24.810
...I need you.

30:27.440 --> 30:30.489
Please just consider what I'm saying.

30:44.480 --> 30:47.051
- He's here.
- And so is his buyer.

30:57.160 --> 30:58.764
I was expecting Armitage.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.970
This country's soil
is not worthy of Mr. Armitage.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.605
Do you have the item?

31:05.600 --> 31:07.011
Where's the money?

31:12.280 --> 31:13.486
And the transcoder?

31:25.720 --> 31:27.290
We better go.

31:36.360 --> 31:37.600
Where'd you get this?

31:40.760 --> 31:42.091
Our hotel room.

31:48.280 --> 31:50.123
Who are they?

31:50.320 --> 31:52.129
Could be A.R.G.U.S.

31:54.440 --> 31:56.044
That's not A.R.G.U.S.

32:03.560 --> 32:05.050
Let's go.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.400
Go.

32:19.160 --> 32:21.083
A.R.G.U.S., they know we're here.

32:21.280 --> 32:24.045
Which is why I got rented soldiers
to secure the perimeter.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.368
It's amazing how cheap you can buy an army.

32:35.160 --> 32:36.241
Diggle!

32:36.440 --> 32:37.771
Behind you.

32:44.520 --> 32:46.807
I never said I didn't
know how to use a gun.

33:49.560 --> 33:53.281
Lyla was your friend and
you endanger her and her daughter for what?

33:53.480 --> 33:55.847
- For a lousy payday?
- Not a payday.

33:56.040 --> 33:58.202
- It's my ticket out.
- Of what?

33:58.400 --> 34:02.371
A.R.G.U.S.! You don't know
the things Wailer's made me do.

34:02.600 --> 34:05.490
You don't know the things
or the person she turns you into.

34:05.680 --> 34:09.480
That still gives you no right
to put a bull's-eye on my family's back.

34:09.679 --> 34:11.681
I had no choice.

34:11.880 --> 34:14.007
But you do, John.

34:14.480 --> 34:17.962
Tell Waller I died.
Tell her you put a bullet in me.

34:23.120 --> 34:24.360
If only.

34:24.760 --> 34:28.161
I've been thinking.
I wanna go home...

34:28.360 --> 34:30.043
...to my brother.

34:30.239 --> 34:34.210
And all his lies and secrets?
Maybe you haven't come as far as I thought.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.801
Let me prove it to you.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.005
Impressive.

35:05.080 --> 35:06.366
I had a good teacher.

35:14.840 --> 35:16.251
Looks like you're going home.

35:26.720 --> 35:28.449
You let me win, didn't you?

35:29.480 --> 35:31.482
I'll be seeing you soon.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.609
Safe flight.

35:43.560 --> 35:45.324
- Thank you.
- Yup.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.170
Thanks.

35:49.880 --> 35:50.961
You Okay?

35:54.120 --> 35:55.690
She's not coming.

35:59.280 --> 36:01.760
I'm sorry, Oliver.
You did everything you could, man.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.171
Oliver.

36:15.960 --> 36:18.167
I'm glad you changed your mind.

36:18.400 --> 36:20.562
Still not sure about
flying commercial though.

36:23.760 --> 36:26.525
Oh. I'm so sorry.

36:28.440 --> 36:29.805
Thea, are you okay?

36:31.080 --> 36:33.447
Yeah, I'm fine.

36:42.320 --> 36:43.924
Laurel?

36:46.320 --> 36:49.449
- I didn't know the Arrow took vacations.
- Hey. What happened?

36:49.680 --> 36:51.011
I'm fine. Please.

36:52.400 --> 36:53.526
What happened?

36:55.320 --> 36:58.483
I tried to do good. It didn't work out.

36:58.680 --> 36:59.841
Laurel.

37:00.960 --> 37:04.931
I know that it probably sounds insane.

37:05.120 --> 37:07.248
It probably is, but...

37:08.680 --> 37:10.444
Sara.

37:11.080 --> 37:12.764
She gave me this.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.402
And when I wear it, it makes me
wanna help people like she did.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.248
Like she's alive again.

37:19.440 --> 37:20.885
I get it.

37:23.440 --> 37:25.681
Sara had training.

37:25.960 --> 37:29.248
- She had years...
- Oliver, I know.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.051
Which is why I need to start.

37:33.240 --> 37:34.651
And I need your help.

37:37.240 --> 37:38.605
L...

37:40.960 --> 37:42.530
No.

37:44.160 --> 37:45.685
- Oliver.
- No.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.529
No.

37:49.720 --> 37:51.165
L...

37:53.520 --> 37:55.966
I want you to consider...

37:57.000 --> 37:59.367
...what would happen to your father...

37:59.560 --> 38:02.484
...if something happened to you.

38:02.880 --> 38:06.726
Oliver, ever since it happened
I have had this fire inside of me.

38:06.920 --> 38:09.844
That I can't get rid of
with booze or pills.

38:10.040 --> 38:11.883
I need another way.

38:12.080 --> 38:14.765
And the other night,
even though it went wrong...

38:14.960 --> 38:18.282
...it was the first time since Sara died
where I haven't felt that fire.

38:18.520 --> 38:20.761
I'm sorry but I can't.

38:22.960 --> 38:25.281
And even if I could...

38:26.520 --> 38:28.363
...Sara would never forgive me.

38:38.560 --> 38:41.530
There we go, yeah.

38:42.040 --> 38:43.929
There we go.

38:46.920 --> 38:48.763
Yeah.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.330
- Hey.
- I love you.

38:56.560 --> 38:59.882
I love you both. The two of you
were all I could think about.

39:03.600 --> 39:06.410
I'm just trying to put her down.

39:06.600 --> 39:09.046
That's okay. I just wanna
look at her for a while.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.248
Okay.

39:12.080 --> 39:15.129
- I have to head into the office.
- Why so late?

39:15.320 --> 39:18.130
I do whatever Amanda Waller asks, remember?

39:24.080 --> 39:25.969
You Okay?

39:28.360 --> 39:30.408
Yeah, just hurry back.

39:33.080 --> 39:34.127
What's with this guy?

39:34.320 --> 39:37.005
Outstanding warrants for
assault and battery in Coast City.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.931
Got an anonymous tip
that he was in Starling.

39:40.120 --> 39:42.122
Anonymous tip, huh?

39:44.440 --> 39:45.771
That's a bad break, buddy.

40:03.040 --> 40:05.168
All right. When can I start?

40:11.280 --> 40:15.365
Do you know how many of QC's techs
said this data was unrecoverable?

40:15.560 --> 40:17.369
Only all of them.

40:18.880 --> 40:22.885
Seems like this would be a good time
to ask for a few days off then.

40:23.080 --> 40:25.048
- You just started.
- I know.

40:25.240 --> 40:28.722
But my friend was struck by lightning
and is in a coma, so...

40:28.920 --> 40:30.684
Well, was.

40:31.280 --> 40:32.930
I don't know. Um...

40:33.120 --> 40:34.963
- it's...
- A long story.

40:37.360 --> 40:40.284
- See you.
- Thanks.

41:08.360 --> 41:10.408
You did good over there.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.045
I had a good teacher.

41:12.280 --> 41:16.046
Ajudgmental and occasionally
temperamental one, but...

41:16.360 --> 41:18.488
Those are the best kind.

41:21.560 --> 41:24.530
Did Thea seem different to you?

41:24.720 --> 41:26.802
Her hair is a lot shorter.

41:27.040 --> 41:29.088
But that's not what you mean.

41:29.280 --> 41:32.090
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

41:33.120 --> 41:36.010
She say anything? She maybe...

41:36.200 --> 41:38.441
...seeing somebody in Corto Maltese or...

41:38.680 --> 41:42.571
If Thea was with anybody else, I've got
a feeling I'd be the last one to know.

41:45.160 --> 41:47.561
Where is she?

41:47.760 --> 41:49.046
Where is Sara?
