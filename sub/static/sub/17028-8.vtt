WEBVTT

00:04.567 --> 00:06.264
Han, what're you doing in our bar?

00:06.265 --> 00:07.946
You know we can't serve kids.

00:08.612 --> 00:09.824
Or did you just want to see

00:09.825 --> 00:12.296
what a successful business looks like?

00:12.440 --> 00:14.842
I know what a successful
business looks like.

00:14.843 --> 00:17.579
My cousin runs a Blimpie's in Queens.

00:17.580 --> 00:20.048
You have a relative that
works at a Blimpie's?

00:20.049 --> 00:23.050
Is he single?

00:25.086 --> 00:27.055
Hi, I'm Clint, the new bartender.

00:27.056 --> 00:29.924
It's a pleasure for you to meet me.

00:29.925 --> 00:32.067
I hired Clint away from that
cool bar down the street.

00:32.069 --> 00:33.228
He has a following.

00:33.229 --> 00:34.796
And his following followed him here,

00:34.797 --> 00:35.940
and now we have a following.

00:35.941 --> 00:38.132
You following?

00:38.133 --> 00:39.511
Oh, a following.

00:39.512 --> 00:42.896
Like I had on YouTube before
they got all weird about nudity.

00:48.154 --> 00:54.081
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#33FF00"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

00:55.327 --> 00:57.028
Wow.

00:57.029 --> 00:59.531
Girls, this place has more people in it

00:59.532 --> 01:01.333
than my first marriage.

01:01.334 --> 01:02.701
Hey, Earl.

01:02.702 --> 01:05.504
Cacao Storm for my diabetic dreamboat?

01:05.504 --> 01:07.572
Well, you know I can't say no to booze.

01:07.573 --> 01:10.075
If I could, I'd still
be in The Temptations.

01:10.076 --> 01:12.611
No, no, no, it's very
little booze, okay?

01:12.612 --> 01:15.413
See, you drink it for the raw cacao.

01:15.414 --> 01:17.582
Yeah, it releases serotonin
and boosts your energy

01:17.583 --> 01:18.617
and your mood.

01:18.618 --> 01:22.120
I'm pretty much a genius.

01:22.121 --> 01:24.288
And I'm pretty much gonna pass.

01:26.091 --> 01:28.994
You want to try a
Cacao Storm? Huh, buddy?

01:28.995 --> 01:30.128
Yeah, you do.

01:30.129 --> 01:31.997
They're addictive.

01:31.998 --> 01:34.499
Raw cacao with a little
chocolate liqueur.

01:34.500 --> 01:37.702
It's how I got to be such a big deal.

01:37.703 --> 01:39.371
And it's how I'm gonna
get a new wardrobe

01:39.372 --> 01:41.006
with the way these are selling.

01:41.007 --> 01:43.208
Soon, I'll be able to
buy clothes from places

01:43.209 --> 01:46.478
that don't also sell gas.

01:46.479 --> 01:49.281
I'll try one. I am a little stressed.

01:49.282 --> 01:50.649
I'm entering the post office's

01:50.650 --> 01:53.685
Federal Duck Stamp Contest this year.

01:53.686 --> 01:56.087
They still have post offices?

01:56.088 --> 01:58.690
I wonder if my "wanted"
poster's still up.

01:58.691 --> 02:02.093
It is. You were a cute kid.

02:02.094 --> 02:03.562
And they have a contest to design

02:03.563 --> 02:05.463
a new duck stamp every year.

02:05.464 --> 02:08.032
If I win, my mallard drawing will be on

02:08.033 --> 02:10.602
official United States postage.

02:10.603 --> 02:12.337
How can there be a winner of a contest

02:12.338 --> 02:15.273
you have to be a loser to enter?

02:15.274 --> 02:17.409
You feeling the buzz yet, son?

02:17.410 --> 02:20.979
You should. I only use
pure Columbian cacao.

02:20.980 --> 02:23.081
Strongest in the city...
actually, in the state.

02:23.082 --> 02:24.983
I just didn't want to brag about it.

02:24.984 --> 02:27.085
It's one of the
greatest things about me.

02:27.086 --> 02:28.086
Oh!

02:28.087 --> 02:29.421
Yes, yes.

02:29.422 --> 02:31.990
I think I feel it. A little jolt.

02:31.991 --> 02:35.260
Wasn't that your
American Gladiator name?

02:35.261 --> 02:37.261
Why you got to harsh my buzz?

02:38.563 --> 02:41.333
Wait till this duck
flies to stamp victory.

02:41.334 --> 02:43.134
Then I'll be ridicule-proof.

02:43.135 --> 02:45.636
You'll never be wedgie-proof.

02:48.373 --> 02:49.641
I just checked our receipts.

02:49.642 --> 02:52.244
We already made $1,500 tonight.

02:52.245 --> 02:53.708
Max, if this keeps up, we'll be able

02:53.709 --> 02:56.281
to watch Hulu without commercials.

02:56.282 --> 02:58.250
$1,500 in one night?

02:58.251 --> 02:59.684
I didn't even make that much

02:59.685 --> 03:02.520
when I turned in my mom
for the reward money.

03:02.521 --> 03:05.390
Plus, it think this is better
than you bartending, Max.

03:05.391 --> 03:08.894
You were great, but your "one
for them, one for me" policy

03:08.895 --> 03:11.162
got a little topless.

03:11.163 --> 03:14.299
You enjoyed the tips, didn't you?

03:14.300 --> 03:15.933
I said "Tips."

03:17.969 --> 03:21.572
Excuse me, excuse me.

03:25.010 --> 03:27.478
Haven't you seen a
stroller in a bar before?

03:28.546 --> 03:30.415
Hey, girls.

03:30.416 --> 03:32.050
What, you're not even gonna say hello,

03:32.051 --> 03:34.352
'cause I look like garbage?

03:34.353 --> 03:36.321
You didn't even give
us a chance, Sophie.

03:36.322 --> 03:39.424
You were too busy running
over all of our customers.

03:39.425 --> 03:41.192
Well, I'm sorry if I'm embarrassing you

03:41.193 --> 03:44.863
with the way I look, Caroline.

03:44.864 --> 03:49.301
Look, I don't have time to make
me and baby Barbara look sexy.

03:49.302 --> 03:51.336
Max, maybe we should get manicures?

03:51.337 --> 03:52.971
I haven't had one since Gwyneth Paltrow

03:52.972 --> 03:55.307
was only a little annoying.

03:55.308 --> 03:57.609
We don't have grooming money.

03:57.610 --> 04:01.046
I'm still cutting my hair
with a sword like Mulan.

04:01.047 --> 04:02.580
Max, we're doing really well,

04:02.581 --> 04:05.183
so why not enjoy our success a little?

04:05.184 --> 04:07.152
I mean, we don't have
"screw you" money yet,

04:07.153 --> 04:09.321
but we have enough to
be mildly unpleasant.

04:09.322 --> 04:11.423
No kiddin'!

04:12.892 --> 04:14.526
Oh, come on, come on!

04:14.527 --> 04:16.461
I want to get our nails did.

04:16.462 --> 04:20.531
Why does it take so long
for a load to finish?

04:20.533 --> 04:23.868
Have you tried dirty talk?

04:26.238 --> 04:27.539
Oh, that's my dryer.

04:27.540 --> 04:29.040
Oh, mine now.

04:29.041 --> 04:31.609
You snooze, you lose.

04:31.610 --> 04:35.280
But I wasn't snoozing, why am I losing?

04:35.281 --> 04:36.614
'Sup, Janice?

04:36.615 --> 04:38.450
How's things down at the Coinstar?

04:38.451 --> 04:42.320
I'm ready for a change.

04:42.321 --> 04:45.523
Max, don't engage her, she
threw my clothes on the ground.

04:45.524 --> 04:48.593
Buzzer go off? You snooze, you lose.

04:48.594 --> 04:51.463
Ugh, now I have to wash
these again because there's...

04:51.464 --> 04:54.966
what I really hope
is fudge on the floor.

04:54.967 --> 04:56.301
Ugh!

04:56.302 --> 04:58.135
Where's my underwear?

05:01.139 --> 05:04.342
Looks like Ralph has a job interview.

05:04.343 --> 05:06.011
Ralph, that's my underwear.

05:06.012 --> 05:07.879
Give it back.

05:07.880 --> 05:11.182
Ugh, I can't wait till we
don't have to come here anymore.

05:11.183 --> 05:13.250
But where will we cook our chicken?

05:16.287 --> 05:17.389
You know what?

05:17.390 --> 05:18.890
We're successful now.

05:18.891 --> 05:22.193
We don't have to come here anymore.

05:22.194 --> 05:23.995
Can I have your attention, everyone?

05:23.996 --> 05:27.332
Uh, that depends, are you a cat video?

05:27.333 --> 05:29.434
I'd like to make an announcement.

05:29.435 --> 05:32.303
As of today, we are saying
good-bye to this place.

05:32.304 --> 05:34.439
So Ralph, you can keep my panties,

05:34.440 --> 05:36.841
I know you have a wedding next month.

05:36.842 --> 05:39.277
Max and I are successful
enough now to afford

05:39.278 --> 05:42.580
our own washer and dryer.

05:42.581 --> 05:45.383
Or more realistically, a
low-budget fluff-and-fold.

05:45.384 --> 05:47.852
So take one last look at us...

05:47.853 --> 05:50.020
But no need to take
out your penis, Marty.

05:53.892 --> 05:55.860
Come on, Max, let's
go get our manicures.

05:55.861 --> 05:58.663
Good-bye, Laundromat,
we are never coming back

05:58.664 --> 06:00.698
to this hell hole again.

06:00.699 --> 06:02.667
You just put another load in the washer.

06:02.668 --> 06:06.036
We are coming back to
this hell hole again.

06:13.004 --> 06:16.007
Earl, we got manicures!

06:16.008 --> 06:19.643
Caroline wanted our nails
to project success, so...

06:22.346 --> 06:26.502
What says "classy lady"
like Monopoly houses?

06:27.285 --> 06:28.886
Wow, congratulations, Max.

06:28.887 --> 06:31.974
This is probably the closest
any of us will ever come

06:31.975 --> 06:35.009
to owning a house.

06:35.010 --> 06:36.377
Speak for yourself, Earl.

06:36.378 --> 06:38.613
Max and I are successful now.

06:38.614 --> 06:40.477
I said good-bye to the
Laundromat this morning,

06:40.478 --> 06:42.617
and this afternoon, I
said good-bye to the bodega

06:42.618 --> 06:44.352
where we get our flu shots.

06:44.353 --> 06:45.987
You could've waited till after I got my

06:45.988 --> 06:48.823
flu shot and sandwich combo.

06:48.824 --> 06:51.092
Hi, could you bring me a water, please?

06:51.093 --> 06:53.061
Um, could you bring someone water

06:53.062 --> 06:55.295
if you had houses for fingers?

06:58.032 --> 07:01.002
I can't wait till we say
good-bye to this place.

07:01.003 --> 07:03.004
I'm gonna be really mean.

07:03.005 --> 07:04.572
I may do it as a poem.

07:04.573 --> 07:07.041
What rhymes with "rat-infested"?

07:07.042 --> 07:09.075
Flat-chested.

07:11.245 --> 07:13.014
You better slow down.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.936
We've only had one good
night at the dessert bar,

07:14.937 --> 07:16.840
and you said we had to
keep working at the diner

07:16.841 --> 07:18.920
till we made enough to be legally poor.

07:18.921 --> 07:20.321
Okay, fine.

07:20.322 --> 07:22.690
It's like those nails
are making you reasonable

07:22.691 --> 07:24.157
and I don't like it.

07:29.897 --> 07:31.232
Han, your hair!

07:31.233 --> 07:34.234
Who are you supposed to
be, Edward Scissor-hans?

07:36.871 --> 07:39.640
I was up all night, sketching my stamp.

07:39.641 --> 07:41.742
Want to see my duck?

07:41.743 --> 07:46.047
Praying that wasn't an auto-correct.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.982
Look at all the practice
ducks I've drawn.

07:47.983 --> 07:49.717
The American Wood duck.

07:49.718 --> 07:51.319
The Harlequin duck.

07:51.320 --> 07:53.121
The Spot-Billed duck.

07:53.122 --> 07:54.255
A mallard.

07:54.256 --> 07:56.357
A mallard.

07:56.358 --> 07:58.159
A mallard, a mallard...

07:58.160 --> 08:01.963
Caroline, take is batteries out.

08:01.964 --> 08:04.665
This beauty's gonna win
me the stamp contest.

08:04.666 --> 08:06.968
All I have to do now is color it.

08:06.969 --> 08:11.005
And then sit back and
plan my victory party.

08:11.006 --> 08:13.307
Guess which stamp I'll
use to send the invites?

08:13.308 --> 08:15.176
Gay flag?

08:15.177 --> 08:17.010
No, a mallard!

08:19.080 --> 08:21.048
Where'd you get that cacao from?

08:21.049 --> 08:23.918
Clint gave me a couple grams
before he left last night.

08:23.919 --> 08:26.853
I've been micro-dosing it all day.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:39.767 --> 08:42.636
Why are you rubbing it on your gums?

08:42.638 --> 08:45.039
Are you teething?

08:45.040 --> 08:48.041
Clint says the buzz is
stronger if I take it straight.

08:49.610 --> 08:52.046
Okay, I didn't believe
Clint when he said cacao

08:52.047 --> 08:55.049
was addictive, but I also
didn't believe in leprechauns

08:55.050 --> 08:59.086
until I started working for one.

08:59.087 --> 09:01.087
If I cut my gums...

09:02.990 --> 09:05.059
Will it enter my bloodstream any faster?

09:05.060 --> 09:06.928
You're a junkie!

09:06.929 --> 09:11.032
Han, you're acting like that
time you had a whole Red Bull.

09:11.033 --> 09:12.934
Okay...

09:12.935 --> 09:15.136
you have a problem!

09:15.137 --> 09:18.005
I'm telling Clint you're cut off.

09:18.006 --> 09:19.941
Well, I'm telling Clint I love him.

09:19.942 --> 09:22.009
He loves that.

09:22.010 --> 09:25.011
Fine, I'll just finish
my stamp without cacao.

09:26.581 --> 09:27.914
Damn it!

09:30.318 --> 09:32.652
Hi, everybody!

09:37.191 --> 09:38.960
I hope they're never expecting Barbara

09:38.961 --> 09:41.862
to have a short-term memory.

09:41.863 --> 09:44.931
Oh, look away, look away.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.736
Things have gotten real bad.

09:48.737 --> 09:49.971
Yeah.

09:49.972 --> 09:53.774
I look like all of you now.

09:53.775 --> 09:56.877
Sophie, why didn't you come
with us to the nail place?

09:56.878 --> 09:59.113
It was so much fun.

09:59.114 --> 10:01.048
I couldn't make it, I was too busy

10:01.049 --> 10:04.819
bedazzling Barbara's diapers.

10:04.820 --> 10:07.054
I'm just gonna have to face it...

10:07.055 --> 10:11.892
I'm not gonna be pretty
again for at least 12 years.

10:11.893 --> 10:16.831
Oh, I'll be Caroline's age by then.

10:16.832 --> 10:20.835
Sophie, I keep saying,
you'll always be sexy to me.

10:20.836 --> 10:22.937
And I hate to sound all lovey-dovey,

10:22.938 --> 10:24.971
but you're giving me a boner.

10:26.674 --> 10:29.944
You're just saying
that 'cause you have to.

10:29.945 --> 10:32.178
I don't want your pity boner.

10:35.650 --> 10:38.319
Caroline, if pity boners are a thing,

10:38.320 --> 10:40.453
you have got to get back out there.

10:42.857 --> 10:45.059
I was thinking the same thing.

10:47.129 --> 10:48.863
Psst! Psst!

10:48.864 --> 10:50.264
You got the stuff, Clint?

10:50.265 --> 10:52.366
It's premium grade, right?

10:52.367 --> 10:54.869
If it isn't, you're in for a very

10:54.870 --> 10:57.838
unpleasant conversation.

10:57.839 --> 11:01.909
My guy from Columbia guarantees it.

11:01.910 --> 11:04.679
Not the country, we
went to college together.

11:04.680 --> 11:05.880
Want a little taste?

11:05.881 --> 11:07.815
You bet your butt I do!

11:07.816 --> 11:10.817
I want to make sure it's
not cut with Nestle Quik.

11:13.721 --> 11:15.356
Oh.

11:15.357 --> 11:18.258
That's the stuff muddy
donkeys are made of.

11:20.127 --> 11:21.195
Max!

11:21.196 --> 11:24.665
Uh, fancy meeting you here.

11:24.666 --> 11:28.636
Clint and I were just
bro-ing out over sports.

11:28.637 --> 11:30.171
And breasts.

11:30.172 --> 11:33.741
And... zoos?

11:33.742 --> 11:35.876
What do men talk about?

11:35.877 --> 11:36.911
Hey, Max.

11:36.912 --> 11:38.379
We killed it last night, huh?

11:38.380 --> 11:40.247
Me more than you.

11:40.248 --> 11:42.817
You gonna want this or not,
I got to go do my podcast.

11:42.818 --> 11:45.686
I'm interviewing myself.

11:45.687 --> 11:48.155
I know a drug deal when I see it!

11:48.156 --> 11:49.323
He's cut off.

11:49.324 --> 11:52.026
Like me on $2 margarita night.

11:52.027 --> 11:55.262
Max, I need that cacao
to finish my duck stamp!

11:55.263 --> 11:58.733
One last ride on the chocolate pony.

11:58.734 --> 12:01.268
Look at you... chocolate
all over your face.

12:01.269 --> 12:05.039
You look like Jonah Hill
reading the reviews for War Dogs.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.708
Clint, don't you dare sell it to him.

12:07.709 --> 12:09.977
You can't tell me what to do, okay?

12:09.978 --> 12:11.779
I'm serious... I will quit.

12:11.780 --> 12:14.982
Oh, hmm, I'll say the same
thing I said to my mother...

12:14.983 --> 12:17.952
resignation accepted.

12:17.953 --> 12:20.888
You just made a huge mistake.

12:20.889 --> 12:22.757
Hmm.

12:22.758 --> 12:25.326
You're talking to someone
who watched the second season

12:25.327 --> 12:26.994
of True Detective.

12:26.995 --> 12:28.695
Right, Han?

12:31.699 --> 12:34.702
That scumbag couldn't
have taken all the cacao.

12:34.703 --> 12:36.871
Quick, help me check the cabinets.

12:36.872 --> 12:38.706
Keep away from my drawers, Han.

12:38.707 --> 12:40.440
You got to be used to hearing that.

12:42.777 --> 12:44.712
Max, I just gave a good-bye speech

12:44.713 --> 12:46.113
at the free clinic.

12:46.114 --> 12:48.015
Oh, also, the lab technician

12:48.016 --> 12:51.152
said for you to call her ASAP.

12:51.153 --> 12:54.388
Ugh, Claire freaks out about everything.

12:54.389 --> 12:56.891
I'll tear this place apart!

12:56.892 --> 12:59.260
Where the hell is the cacao?

12:59.261 --> 13:00.961
What's happening, where's Clint?

13:00.962 --> 13:02.830
- He quit.
- He quit?

13:02.831 --> 13:04.265
But what about his following?

13:04.266 --> 13:05.733
What about our following?

13:05.734 --> 13:07.168
What about my good-bye tour?

13:07.169 --> 13:09.170
Say good-bye to it.

13:09.171 --> 13:11.638
I think I found some!

13:13.374 --> 13:16.744
Nope, that was straight-up dirt.

13:16.745 --> 13:18.646
It's for the best.

13:18.647 --> 13:21.315
'Cause Jane Cacaoski over
there can't get enough.

13:21.316 --> 13:23.150
I'll just get back behind the bar.

13:23.151 --> 13:26.654
Now, if you'll excuse me,
one of my hotels came loose

13:26.655 --> 13:28.956
while I was giving someone the finger.

13:28.957 --> 13:31.158
I guess I'm going to have
to call that other dealer

13:31.159 --> 13:32.960
I found on Craigslist.

13:32.961 --> 13:35.663
I'm Ice-T and I need my Coco.

13:35.664 --> 13:37.364
Han, if you can get that cacao,

13:37.365 --> 13:40.234
Max can make the Cacao Storms herself.

13:40.235 --> 13:43.737
I've seen her make opium out of
poppy seed bagels and a Lacroix.

13:43.738 --> 13:44.872
Han, call that dealer.

13:44.873 --> 13:46.674
Already dialing.

13:46.675 --> 13:49.410
I'm halfway down the Hershey Highway.

13:49.411 --> 13:52.680
I meant the Fudge Factory.

13:52.681 --> 13:54.504
I don't want to hear
about your personal life,

13:54.505 --> 13:56.705
just call the dealer.

14:03.658 --> 14:05.226
Han, where is this guy?

14:05.227 --> 14:06.394
I'm scared.

14:06.395 --> 14:08.563
Someone might think we're a couple.

14:08.564 --> 14:10.465
I hope he gets here soon.

14:10.466 --> 14:13.033
I just snorted a pint of Chunky Monkey.

14:14.902 --> 14:17.205
That's him, now act cool.

14:17.206 --> 14:19.173
Yoo-hoo, Mr. Drug Dealer!

14:19.174 --> 14:20.908
Right here.

14:20.909 --> 14:22.510
You're embarrassing me!

14:22.511 --> 14:25.179
Oh, also, tell him we're not a couple.

14:25.180 --> 14:26.647
You guys here for the cacao?

14:26.648 --> 14:29.183
Let's cut to the
chase, where's the dope?

14:29.184 --> 14:30.407
Standing right in front of me.

14:30.408 --> 14:32.520
- We're not together.
- Shh!

14:32.521 --> 14:34.021
You want the cops to hear us?

14:34.022 --> 14:37.058
Would it matter? You're
selling chocolate.

14:37.059 --> 14:39.594
I know, but it's more fun
to act like it's naughty.

14:39.595 --> 14:41.062
That's the only reason I do this.

14:41.063 --> 14:42.330
I'm so bored.

14:42.331 --> 14:44.031
I'm a stay-at-home grandpa.

14:44.032 --> 14:46.200
Show me the skrank!

14:46.201 --> 14:49.203
That's the word I made
up for street cacao.

14:49.204 --> 14:50.471
Here it is.

14:50.472 --> 14:51.735
Had to kill a hooker to get it.

14:52.641 --> 14:55.510
I wish.

14:55.511 --> 14:57.478
My daughter-in-law works for Nestle.

14:57.479 --> 15:00.181
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

15:00.182 --> 15:01.983
Earl, what're you doing out here?

15:01.984 --> 15:04.152
Just to be clear, I'm out here with Han

15:04.153 --> 15:06.621
for business, nothing romantic.

15:06.622 --> 15:08.439
What are you doing out here

15:08.440 --> 15:12.342
with my Canadian Viagra connection?

15:12.343 --> 15:15.378
- Hey, Earl!
- Hey, Bill!

15:15.379 --> 15:17.480
Hey, man, how's your daughter-in-law?

15:17.481 --> 15:20.450
Still climbing the corporate
ladder at Nestle Toronto?

15:20.451 --> 15:22.241
And doing CrossFit on the weekends.

15:22.242 --> 15:22.886
Uh-huh.

15:22.887 --> 15:24.754
And Ted's finally got
his real estate license.

15:24.755 --> 15:27.690
- Oh...
- No one cares, Grandpa!

15:27.691 --> 15:29.893
Tell that to the pigeons in the park!

15:29.894 --> 15:33.396
I'm this close to
main-lining Tootsie Rolls.

15:33.397 --> 15:36.733
- Here's the money.
- Not this again!

15:36.734 --> 15:38.536
I come out here to smoke a joint,

15:38.537 --> 15:40.637
and I walk in on a drug deal?

15:40.638 --> 15:41.771
Shame!

15:41.772 --> 15:43.473
Hey, you!

15:43.474 --> 15:46.976
Get out of here before I pop
a cap in your Honda Odyssey.

15:46.978 --> 15:49.813
I'm sorry, it was either
this, or have an affair.

15:49.814 --> 15:51.614
And I'm just too tired.

15:53.684 --> 15:55.686
Well, it looks like
I got to go tell Ruth

15:55.687 --> 15:58.388
it's gonna be an "everything
but" kind of night

15:58.389 --> 16:00.623
Jeez.

16:00.624 --> 16:03.260
I learned it from watching you, Dad?

16:03.261 --> 16:06.263
Max, we need that cacao
for our dessert bar.

16:06.264 --> 16:08.007
I already told the soup
kitchen what I think

16:08.008 --> 16:11.334
of their tomato bisque,
so there's no turning back.

16:11.335 --> 16:14.404
Your addictions are both out of control.

16:14.405 --> 16:17.407
Caroline, there are
no shortcuts to success

16:17.408 --> 16:19.542
or creating a stamp-worthy mallard.

16:19.543 --> 16:23.346
Life is a slow, steady
climb to just getting by.

16:23.347 --> 16:24.981
Snap out of it!

16:24.982 --> 16:27.417
Me? You're addicted too.

16:27.418 --> 16:28.985
To these nails.

16:30.454 --> 16:33.455
No I'm not, I can stop any time!

16:36.860 --> 16:38.995
Then why are you crying?

16:38.996 --> 16:40.697
'Cause I'm on my knees in an alley

16:40.698 --> 16:43.566
and nothing fun is happening!

16:43.567 --> 16:46.302
Home wrecker!

16:46.303 --> 16:47.804
You know, fine!

16:47.805 --> 16:50.707
Maybe I like the way they make me feel.

16:50.708 --> 16:52.909
But you... you were so high on success,

16:52.910 --> 16:55.044
you were willing to let Han OD!

16:55.045 --> 16:57.981
Or, at least, get really,
really hyper-active.

16:57.982 --> 17:01.451
So what? You don't care
about me, Max, do you?

17:02.653 --> 17:05.421
No.

17:05.422 --> 17:06.521
Maybe a little.

17:09.326 --> 17:11.961
See how your addiction
has affected me, Caroline?

17:11.962 --> 17:14.430
I just had to admit I care about Han!

17:14.431 --> 17:16.633
Now I'm flying high on that!

17:16.634 --> 17:19.368
I'm gonna go try to finish my stamp.

17:19.369 --> 17:21.604
Perhaps some hot cocoa would help.

17:21.605 --> 17:23.571
Administered rectally, of course.

17:25.708 --> 17:27.676
Found it!

17:27.678 --> 17:29.312
Sophie?

17:29.313 --> 17:32.448
Is there anyone we
know not in this alley?

17:32.449 --> 17:35.318
I found Barbara's bedazzler.

17:35.319 --> 17:38.521
Oh, yeah, it's all about her now.

17:38.522 --> 17:41.824
Oh, you can't be gorgeous
and be a good mother.

17:41.825 --> 17:44.494
Just look at Neil Patrick Harris.

17:44.495 --> 17:48.364
Well, I think he's very charming
and I think you're being unfair.

17:48.365 --> 17:51.000
This might be what's left of
my nails talking, but Sophie,

17:51.001 --> 17:53.269
if you're not decked out
with your boobs half showing,

17:53.270 --> 17:56.472
are you really setting the
right example for Barbara?

17:56.473 --> 17:59.509
Oh, from this side of the dumpster,

17:59.510 --> 18:02.278
you're making a lot of sense, girl.

18:02.279 --> 18:03.546
You really are.

18:03.547 --> 18:05.215
Are you gonna start brushing your teeth

18:05.216 --> 18:06.683
and putting the seat down?

18:06.684 --> 18:07.916
No.

18:14.456 --> 18:15.857
Here's your flan-tini.

18:15.858 --> 18:18.066
And here's my flan-tini.

18:18.067 --> 18:20.201
Good to be back.

18:20.202 --> 18:22.671
Well, I tried, but I can't find Clint.

18:22.672 --> 18:25.640
I feel like every man
I've ever had sex with.

18:25.641 --> 18:28.576
We don't need Clint or his stupid cacao.

18:28.577 --> 18:31.680
Uh, although, his podcast
was pretty interesting.

18:31.681 --> 18:35.583
Those girls he worked for
sounded like nightmares.

18:35.584 --> 18:38.353
I'm gonna have one, two, three Sprites.

18:38.354 --> 18:40.255
We're getting wild tonight.

18:40.256 --> 18:41.856
Coming right up, Bill the Dealer.

18:41.857 --> 18:43.558
Oh, it's just Bill now.

18:43.559 --> 18:45.860
I accidentally butt-dialed
my wife during a major

18:45.861 --> 18:47.796
Pepcid AC drop.

18:47.797 --> 18:49.196
She took the minivan.

18:52.634 --> 18:56.404
Hey, everybody!

18:56.405 --> 18:59.307
No, it's not Suzanne Somers.

18:59.308 --> 19:01.242
It's me, Sophie!

19:01.243 --> 19:03.778
Wow, Sophie got her sexy back.

19:03.779 --> 19:07.182
Yeah, and front and under.

19:07.183 --> 19:10.085
Sophie, you deserve a flan-tini.

19:10.086 --> 19:11.653
And so do I.

19:11.654 --> 19:14.489
Oh, you know what, I did
what you told me to do

19:14.490 --> 19:17.625
and I dropped baby Barbara
off at the trainer/babysitter,

19:17.626 --> 19:21.629
and I had a bunch of Korean
ladies go to town on me.

19:21.630 --> 19:23.264
Hey, where's Oleg?

19:23.265 --> 19:24.731
I told him to meet me here.

19:28.136 --> 19:29.938
Sophie?

19:29.939 --> 19:31.573
You look as beautiful as the day

19:31.574 --> 19:34.542
we first did it on the sink.

19:34.543 --> 19:37.846
Damn straight, I do!

19:37.847 --> 19:40.882
Yo, what's with the
white people's clothes?

19:40.883 --> 19:43.752
Yeah, what's going on? I
can't even see any nipple.

19:43.753 --> 19:46.421
But somehow, it's worse.

19:46.422 --> 19:49.391
Sophie, I want you to see
that we don't have to be

19:49.392 --> 19:51.559
the sexy couple anymore.

19:51.560 --> 19:52.894
Anymore?

19:52.895 --> 19:54.763
When were you guys the sexy couple?

19:54.764 --> 19:57.665
That weekend you went to Amish Country?

19:57.666 --> 19:59.768
Oh, yeah.

19:59.769 --> 20:02.470
Do you remember when
we did it in that buggy

20:02.471 --> 20:04.472
in front of that family?

20:04.473 --> 20:09.277
Oh, I bet they wish they
had a camera for that.

20:09.278 --> 20:11.446
You want to go do it in the bathroom...

20:11.447 --> 20:12.914
buggy-style?

20:12.915 --> 20:16.651
Oh, I'm gonna pretend that Jebediah

20:16.652 --> 20:18.887
is turning away in shame.

20:18.888 --> 20:21.188
I'm gonna pretend he isn't.

20:23.825 --> 20:27.328
I guess we're scrubbing
down our bathroom later.

20:27.329 --> 20:28.463
We're heading out.

20:28.464 --> 20:30.331
It's almost 8:00.

20:30.332 --> 20:32.467
Here's my last bag of cacao.

20:32.468 --> 20:34.202
I can't do anything with it,

20:34.203 --> 20:36.204
not with my cholesterol.

20:36.205 --> 20:38.173
A tiny baggie of cacao?

20:38.174 --> 20:39.941
What're we gonna do with this?

20:39.942 --> 20:41.876
Same thing I do with any powder I find:

20:41.877 --> 20:43.577
see what all the fuss is about.

20:46.181 --> 20:48.950
Mmm.

20:48.951 --> 20:50.684
- Not hating it.
- Mm-mm. No.

20:53.722 --> 20:55.523
Holding out on me?

20:55.524 --> 20:58.393
You skrank skanks!

20:58.394 --> 21:00.728
I'm coming in!
