WEBVTT

00:18.066 --> 00:20.533
You're in Springwood now.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.533
And you're all mine.

00:50.500 --> 00:53.366
Psychologist Brandon Keffler
dies in a live broadcast

00:53.433 --> 00:54.866
tormented by nightmares.

00:54.933 --> 00:56.433
Are dreams lethal?

00:56.500 --> 00:59.366
Blood stains on our studio floor
suggest they are.

00:59.433 --> 01:01.633
So, does the recent death
of cameraman Garry Heath

01:01.700 --> 01:04.466
who was destroyed
by obsessions in his dreams.

01:04.533 --> 01:07.233
And then, there's
the most shocking death of all.

01:07.300 --> 01:10.000
Stan Brooks the former host
of this show

01:10.066 --> 01:13.266
found dead in his bed
smothered by his own pillow.

01:13.333 --> 01:14.833
It all began when a mother
sought help

01:14.900 --> 01:16.766
for her son on this show.

01:16.833 --> 01:19.333
Teenager Randy Jennings
will be my guest as I explore

01:19.400 --> 01:22.666
dreams that kill, on the next
"Springwood Confidential"

01:22.733 --> 01:23.733
with Charlie Nichels.

01:25.033 --> 01:26.800
Cut. We're clear.

01:26.866 --> 01:28.900
Great timing..
That was really intense.

01:28.966 --> 01:30.433
Yeah, well I told you
this show's gonna be hot.

01:30.500 --> 01:31.700
Hey, I'm not
kidding you, Charlie.

01:31.766 --> 01:33.533
Nobody in the business can hype
a topic the way you can.

01:33.600 --> 01:36.333
Well, since good old Stan
was kind enough to die

01:36.400 --> 01:38.666
during sweeps weeks,
I figured the least I could do

01:38.733 --> 01:40.500
is take advantage of it.

01:40.566 --> 01:42.566
Hey, that was a joke, bubby.

01:42.633 --> 01:44.600
It's a joke, a joke.

01:45.666 --> 01:47.233
I knew that.

01:51.266 --> 01:52.400
Huh, look at this.

01:52.466 --> 01:53.933
Oprah's up two share points.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.966
Say, maybe I ought to get a
gimmick like that diet of hers

01:56.033 --> 01:58.000
you know, shave my head
or something.

01:59.466 --> 02:01.133
Now, speaking of shaves, Scotty

02:01.200 --> 02:02.733
be careful today, would ya?

02:02.800 --> 02:05.233
My chin looks like hamburger
from that razor

02:05.300 --> 02:07.233
you used last time.

02:09.333 --> 02:11.466
These sharp enough for ya?

02:11.533 --> 02:14.666
Four blades to cut you
excellent close.

02:14.733 --> 02:16.100
Who are you?

02:16.166 --> 02:17.433
What do you want?

02:17.500 --> 02:20.666
I want you to forget
the dream show.

02:20.733 --> 02:22.500
Forget the dream show? Why?

02:22.566 --> 02:24.866
You'll scare everybody awake

02:24.933 --> 02:28.200
and I won't have anybody
to play with.

02:28.266 --> 02:29.466
But it's not that easy.

02:29.533 --> 02:30.800
I already taped the promo.

02:30.866 --> 02:32.866
'You do that show..'

02:32.933 --> 02:34.700
...and the next
dream that kills..

02:35.666 --> 02:36.800
...will be yours.

02:40.266 --> 02:41.800
Look at this, I'm bleeding!

02:41.866 --> 02:43.400
I'm real sorry, Mr. Nichels.

02:43.466 --> 02:45.233
You jerked your head
in your sleep.

02:45.300 --> 02:47.100
You must have had
a bad dream or something.

02:47.166 --> 02:49.000
What the hell are you
trying to do, slit my throat?

02:49.066 --> 02:50.466
It's just a nick, Mr. Nichels.

02:50.533 --> 02:52.033
I..
It won't happen again.

02:52.100 --> 02:53.666
You damn right, it won't.

02:53.733 --> 02:54.800
You are outta here.

02:54.866 --> 02:57.133
You are history!

03:01.066 --> 03:04.033
Thank you,
thank you all very much

03:04.100 --> 03:05.666
from the bottom of my heart.

03:05.733 --> 03:08.633
You're too kind,
really, too, too kind.

03:08.700 --> 03:12.966
I could grow to love this
showbiz stuff.

03:13.033 --> 03:15.266
The excitement, the glamour.

03:15.333 --> 03:16.500
The chicks.

03:16.566 --> 03:19.200
Oh, like they say

03:19.266 --> 03:21.300
fame and fortune
are the stuff

03:21.366 --> 03:23.433
dreams are made of.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.366
Lights!

03:26.433 --> 03:27.966
Camera!

03:28.033 --> 03:30.600
Fr-r-reddy!

03:33.166 --> 03:34.933
Any sign of him, yet?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.100
Evan, stop worrying.
Charlie is a pro.

03:37.166 --> 03:40.033
He's not gonna skip out on you.

03:40.100 --> 03:41.566
Charlie, we're on the air
in 20 minutes.

03:41.633 --> 03:43.066
- Where you've been?
- I needed a shave.

03:43.133 --> 03:44.433
So, I heard.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.933
What exactly happened
between you and Scotty anyway?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.800
Well, nothing that canning
the old guy wouldn't fix.

03:49.866 --> 03:52.900
Charlie, he's been with
this station for 20 years.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.133
You couldn't give him a break?

03:54.200 --> 03:56.000
Look, either you get a new
make up man

03:56.066 --> 03:59.066
or I get a new producer,
your choice.

03:59.133 --> 04:01.800
And by the way, I've been
thinking it over, I'm, uh..

04:01.866 --> 04:04.033
...I'm pulling the plug
on "Dreams That Kill."

04:04.100 --> 04:05.433
What? Why?

04:05.500 --> 04:07.300
Charlie, come on.

04:07.366 --> 04:08.666
Because it's a dumb idea.

04:08.733 --> 04:12.033
But it was your idea, Charlie.
Everybody loves it.

04:12.100 --> 04:15.066
Look, Evan, I want another
topic, that's all.

04:15.133 --> 04:18.233
How am I supposed to book
a new show at the last minute?

04:18.300 --> 04:19.400
Is that a problem?

04:19.466 --> 04:21.733
Yeah..

04:21.800 --> 04:22.900
...but I'll take care of it.

04:22.966 --> 04:24.400
That's my girl.

04:24.466 --> 04:26.833
See you after the show, baby.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.400
Britt, how could you
let him get away with that?

04:31.466 --> 04:32.966
I love him.

04:33.033 --> 04:34.333
Great!

04:42.233 --> 04:44.000
And we're back with
Enid Erickson the founder of

04:44.066 --> 04:45.666
Mothers Against
Musical Atrocities

04:45.733 --> 04:48.166
or MAMA.

04:48.233 --> 04:49.766
And joining us now
is Monkey Puke Stone.

04:49.833 --> 04:52.066
Lead singer of
"Stone and the Stoners."

04:52.133 --> 04:53.300
So, now, tell me
what do I call you?

04:53.366 --> 04:55.433
I call you Monkey,
Mr. Pukes, Stone?

04:55.500 --> 04:57.066
Wh-wh-what do you want here?

04:57.133 --> 04:58.966
You can call me Peter.

04:59.033 --> 05:00.533
Oh, Peter,
is that your real name?

05:00.600 --> 05:02.566
No, I just like it.

05:02.633 --> 05:04.866
See, yesterday
people called me Tim.

05:04.933 --> 05:06.666
But I don't like Tim no more.

05:06.733 --> 05:07.866
'I see.'

05:07.933 --> 05:09.700
Okay, Frank.

05:09.766 --> 05:12.433
So, uh, tell me,
how do you respond to Enid here

05:12.500 --> 05:13.700
when she claims that your music

05:13.766 --> 05:15.533
is corrupting the minds
of American children?

05:15.600 --> 05:17.600
Well, I respond
by saying shut up.

05:19.100 --> 05:21.300
I-I-I never heard of
such a thing. I..

05:21.366 --> 05:24.566
You heard me, I said
shut your big fat mouth.

05:24.633 --> 05:26.100
You know, you talk too much
for a chick

05:26.166 --> 05:27.633
who doesn't know
what she's talking about.

05:27.700 --> 05:30.366
Well, I never, I know exactly
what I'm talking about.

05:30.433 --> 05:32.600
You-you, hippie freak!

05:33.533 --> 05:34.766
'Just look at you.'

05:34.833 --> 05:36.333
'What kind of
a role model are you'

05:36.400 --> 05:39.200
for the...youth of America?

05:39.266 --> 05:40.733
You know what this lady needs,
don't you?

05:40.800 --> 05:42.000
What's that?

05:42.066 --> 05:43.800
Well, she needs
a real man like you and me

05:43.866 --> 05:45.166
to take her out back and give--

05:45.233 --> 05:47.800
Oh-h! You're right, right!
Okay, alright, fine. Yeah.

05:47.866 --> 05:49.566
Yeah, so, uh, Enid

05:49.633 --> 05:51.300
uh, tell me
why do you think his music

05:51.366 --> 05:52.533
'is corrupting
our-our kids today?'

05:52.600 --> 05:54.533
Take me out back
and-and give me the what?

05:54.600 --> 05:56.833
I know what you're implying,
young man.

05:56.900 --> 05:58.400
I wasn't born yesterday.

05:58.466 --> 06:00.266
No, it was more like
a hundred years ago.

06:00.333 --> 06:02.033
Oh, you pervert!

06:02.100 --> 06:04.000
- Ooh.
- Oh, look, I-I'm trying--

06:09.533 --> 06:13.266
Holy cow, uh, uh,
go to commercial, now!

06:13.333 --> 06:15.133
An-and somebody
call the paramedics. Hurry!

06:15.200 --> 06:16.466
Come on!

06:16.533 --> 06:17.800
'Charlie?'

06:20.966 --> 06:22.666
'Charlie?'

06:22.733 --> 06:24.700
Charlie, come on, man.

06:34.166 --> 06:35.433
Hey, there you are, Charlie.

06:35.500 --> 06:36.533
How you feelin'?

06:36.600 --> 06:37.900
Well, lot better
than you look, bubby.

06:37.966 --> 06:39.633
What's the matter,
you run out of Clearasil, huh?

06:39.700 --> 06:41.866
Suits upstairs. Aren't too
crazy about the program.

06:41.933 --> 06:43.400
Well, they wouldn't know
a classic show if it

06:43.466 --> 06:44.533
came wrapped
in a Nielsen Report.

06:44.600 --> 06:45.800
It's not funny, Charlie.

06:45.866 --> 06:46.866
Management didn't like
the way you lost

06:46.933 --> 06:48.000
control out there yesterday.

06:48.066 --> 06:50.800
- 'They'll get over it.'
- Not this time.

06:50.866 --> 06:52.966
They're pulling you off of
"Springwood Confidential."

06:53.033 --> 06:54.633
Oh, come on, get serious.

06:54.700 --> 06:57.433
They already hired a new host
and he starts today.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.633
That's ridiculous.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.500
Uh, they can't
just fire Charlie.

07:01.566 --> 07:03.633
It's my show, Evan.

07:03.700 --> 07:05.066
It's their station.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.533
You think my fans
are gonna stand for this?

07:06.600 --> 07:07.833
They are loyal to me.

07:07.900 --> 07:10.200
The ratings are gonna
go right in the toilet.

07:10.266 --> 07:11.500
And that's why
this new guy wants to have

07:11.566 --> 07:12.666
Charlie as his first guest.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.800
To make a smooth transition.

07:14.866 --> 07:16.066
Oh, really?

07:16.133 --> 07:18.266
Well, you can have him stick
his transition, man.

07:18.333 --> 07:19.933
I'm not gonna lift
a finger to help him.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.333
'You're under contract,
Charlie.'

07:21.400 --> 07:23.766
The station will sue your socks
off if you don't appear.

07:23.833 --> 07:26.566
You know, I-I don't
believe this is happening to me.

07:26.633 --> 07:28.266
I mean, I'm Charlie Nichels
for God's sake.

07:28.333 --> 07:30.300
'I'm not one of your stupid
hack announcers.'

07:33.700 --> 07:36.633
Okay, okay, so where's this
exciting new host

07:36.700 --> 07:38.266
they found overnight?

07:38.333 --> 07:40.700
Big mouth talk show hosts.

07:40.766 --> 07:42.533
Do they deserve to live?

07:42.600 --> 07:45.433
Be here for the next
"Springwood Confidential" story.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.433
Freddy Krueger.

07:56.266 --> 07:58.366
Thank you. Thank you very much.

07:58.433 --> 08:01.766
You're too beautiful,
each and every one of you.

08:01.833 --> 08:02.766
I love you all.

08:02.833 --> 08:05.566
But now, let's get down to it.

08:05.633 --> 08:07.433
When Charlie Nichels
hosted this show

08:07.500 --> 08:09.333
he used to grill his guest.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.366
But, now, it's their turn

08:11.433 --> 08:13.933
to gr-r-rill him!

08:26.433 --> 08:29.400
Hey, how am I doing,
breath?

08:31.233 --> 08:33.900
Is the show hot enough for you?

08:36.166 --> 08:38.866
Please, somebody help me!

08:38.933 --> 08:40.733
Please!

08:43.800 --> 08:44.700
Umm.

08:44.766 --> 08:46.833
What do you think, babe?

08:46.900 --> 08:48.700
I think, he's done, Freddy

08:48.766 --> 08:52.200
Well, maybe you are well done!

08:58.366 --> 08:59.833
Begin!

09:19.400 --> 09:21.333
Charlie! Honey,
honey, are you okay?

09:22.666 --> 09:24.766
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.

09:24.833 --> 09:25.933
You-you want me
to call the nurse?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.400
Oh, no, no.

09:27.466 --> 09:30.666
I was just having this
nightmare, you wouldn't believe.

09:30.733 --> 09:32.700
Look, would you mind
getting rid of that?

09:32.766 --> 09:34.100
It's my lunch,
I'm starved.

09:34.166 --> 09:35.833
I don't care. Get some
damn yoghurt or something.

09:35.900 --> 09:36.933
I don't want to look at that.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.600
Ooh, it must've been
some nightmare.

09:39.666 --> 09:40.900
'You wanna talk about it?'

09:40.966 --> 09:42.633
No, uh..

09:42.700 --> 09:43.833
Well, either you talk about it

09:43.900 --> 09:45.933
or I'm bringing back
the chicken.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.333
Okay, there was this weirdo.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.166
Really, a really disgusting guy
with a mangled face

09:51.233 --> 09:52.866
and then he took over
as host of the show.

09:52.933 --> 09:54.800
I don't know, he was,
he called himself Frankie

09:54.866 --> 09:57.533
or Freddy or something.

09:57.600 --> 09:58.766
Wait a minute.

09:58.833 --> 10:00.700
That shrink who went bananas
on the show remember

10:00.766 --> 10:03.233
he was convinced that some guy
named Freddy was after him.

10:03.300 --> 10:04.900
- So?
- So?

10:04.966 --> 10:08.000
So, maybe it's the same guy,
maybe he's after me, now.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.733
Charlie, it was just a dream.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.200
I wouldn't read
too much into it.

10:13.266 --> 10:15.000
Look, you just lay back
and relax.

10:15.066 --> 10:17.100
I'm gonna go get the doctor
and tell her that you're up.

10:19.866 --> 10:22.600
'Hey, Charlie. Great news.'

10:22.666 --> 10:25.200
You're X-ray seemed to be fine,
Mr. Nichels.

10:25.266 --> 10:26.400
You'll have a headache
for a while

10:26.466 --> 10:28.233
'but that should be about it.'

10:28.300 --> 10:30.833
So, what was the response
to the show, have you heard?

10:30.900 --> 10:32.700
They're calling
it cheap sensationalism.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.200
Get outta here!

10:34.266 --> 10:35.733
That was incredible stuff!

10:35.800 --> 10:37.833
- Come on, the fight!
- It's been done.

10:37.900 --> 10:40.700
Geraldo owns
a let's get physical gag.

10:40.766 --> 10:42.033
What people want..

10:42.100 --> 10:43.700
...is the show
we promoted, Charlie.

10:43.766 --> 10:45.366
I told you before,
I'm not gonna

10:45.433 --> 10:46.866
do that show,
"Dreams That Kill."

10:46.933 --> 10:48.600
But that's what
everybody expects to see.

10:48.666 --> 10:49.933
Yeah, well, then,
let 'em watch Geraldo.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.433
He-he's such
a great trendsetter.

10:51.500 --> 10:52.833
'Now, Charlie--'

10:52.900 --> 10:55.233
Look, I told you before
and I'm gonna tell you again

10:55.300 --> 10:57.766
I will quit before I go
on the air with that topic!

10:57.833 --> 10:59.266
Gentlemen, please.

10:59.333 --> 11:03.033
It's important that Mr. Nichels
avoid getting this upset.

11:03.100 --> 11:05.966
How can I do that
with this moron harassing me?

11:06.033 --> 11:08.366
I'd like to keep you here
overnight for observation

11:08.433 --> 11:10.533
just to be on the safe side.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.966
In the meantime, here's
something to help you sleep.

11:13.033 --> 11:15.066
I'll look in on you later.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.300
Thanks, doc, I appreciate it.

11:17.366 --> 11:19.133
Get some rest, Charlie,
I'll see you tomorrow.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.166
- Yeah, right.
- You hang in there.

11:21.233 --> 11:22.900
Okay, Evan.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.133
What are you doing?

11:28.200 --> 11:29.566
Doctor told you to take that.

11:29.633 --> 11:33.000
Forget it. No way I'm going
back to that nightmare.

11:33.066 --> 11:35.533
Charlie, listen to me.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.133
I'm here with you.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.533
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

11:39.600 --> 11:42.500
No one is going to get you

11:42.566 --> 11:44.333
Except me.

11:45.466 --> 11:47.433
Wh-what are you talking about?

11:47.500 --> 11:50.900
Well, I thought you might
need some help staying awake.

11:52.233 --> 11:54.600
Are you kidding me?

11:54.666 --> 11:56.733
Unh-unh.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.100
I've never been
more serious in my life.

12:06.933 --> 12:09.233
Ah, the miracles
of modern medicine!

12:30.600 --> 12:31.533
You're a devil..

12:33.366 --> 12:34.600
Whoa! No!

12:37.100 --> 12:38.900
- Are you alright, Mr. Nichels?
- Ah! Uh..

12:38.966 --> 12:40.266
'I thought I heard a scream.'

12:40.333 --> 12:43.266
No, no, no, those, no screaming
here, I didn't hear a scream.

12:43.333 --> 12:44.466
Well, then I'm sorry.

12:44.533 --> 12:46.033
Oh, would you like me
to fluff your pillow.

12:46.100 --> 12:48.300
No! No, no,
I'll fluff 'em, it's fine.

12:48.366 --> 12:50.233
Thanks.

12:51.466 --> 12:53.700
Oh, wha-what's-what's
going on out there?

12:53.766 --> 12:55.833
Emergency case just came in.

12:55.900 --> 12:59.366
A teenage boy had some kind of
seizure while he was sleeping.

12:59.433 --> 13:02.733
Poor thing, stabbed himself
with darts in the throat.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.000
My God! And that happened
while he was asleep?

13:05.066 --> 13:06.366
Can you believe it?

13:06.433 --> 13:07.666
He's already lost so much blood

13:07.733 --> 13:09.866
there's not much chance
of his survival.

13:09.933 --> 13:12.633
I'm sorry you had to see that,
Mr. Nichels.

13:12.700 --> 13:14.566
Hope you get back to sleep.

13:14.633 --> 13:16.700
Wait a minute.
Uh, what was his name?

13:16.766 --> 13:17.766
'Whose name?'

13:17.833 --> 13:19.800
The kid with the darts
in his throat.

13:21.433 --> 13:24.000
Jennings. Randy Jennings.

13:24.066 --> 13:26.500
'Do you know him?'

13:26.566 --> 13:29.966
Randy Jennings will be my guest
as I explore dreams that kill

13:30.033 --> 13:32.066
on the next
"Springwood Confidential"

13:32.133 --> 13:33.633
with Charlie Nichels.

13:35.166 --> 13:37.700
No, no, I, uh..

13:37.766 --> 13:39.400
No, I never heard of him.

13:56.666 --> 13:57.966
Hey, Charlie, welcome back!

13:58.033 --> 14:00.966
Yeah! Hey, what,
no presents, huh?

14:01.033 --> 14:02.333
Hey, you weren't gone that long.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.966
Well, next time,
I'll have to come up with

14:04.033 --> 14:05.266
uh, more serious injuries.

14:05.333 --> 14:07.833
Okay, everybody,
back to work, okay.

14:07.900 --> 14:09.333
You're a bunch of cheapskates.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.566
No presents, no goofin' off.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.000
So how you feelin'?

14:13.066 --> 14:14.766
Well, uh, you tell me.

14:14.833 --> 14:16.266
Have we, uh..

14:16.333 --> 14:18.600
...have we finally 86'd
"Dreams That Kill?"

14:18.666 --> 14:20.500
- It's dead and buried.
- Good.

14:20.566 --> 14:22.200
Then as soon as I get
a little caffeine in me

14:22.266 --> 14:23.700
I'll be as good as new.

14:23.766 --> 14:25.400
Uh, did you get
a new make-up man?

14:25.466 --> 14:26.733
Yes, and he's supposed to
be excellent.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.633
Well, he better be,
with these bags under my eyes

14:28.700 --> 14:30.633
it looks like
I need a skycap.

14:32.333 --> 14:34.233
He looks a little ragged.

14:34.300 --> 14:36.233
Are you sure he's okay?

14:36.300 --> 14:38.866
Well, he didn't get
much sleep last night.

14:38.933 --> 14:41.233
Other than that, he's fine

14:41.300 --> 14:43.266
Don't worry.

14:43.333 --> 14:45.000
Once he gets in front
of a camera

14:45.066 --> 14:47.466
he'll be the same old Charlie.

14:47.533 --> 14:49.866
"Well, folks, despite
the outpouring of your mail..

14:49.933 --> 14:51.133
"...I'm back.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.933
"I've even got a new notch
in my noggin as

14:53.000 --> 14:54.400
'"a souvenir of our last show.'

14:54.466 --> 14:56.700
"I mean, could you
believe those whackos we had on?

14:56.766 --> 14:58.033
"They were too much.

14:58.100 --> 15:01.866
"Now, uh, let's hope, today,
I can duck the punches, alright?

15:01.933 --> 15:04.400
"Oh, and speaking of today, what
a show we got lined up for you.

15:04.466 --> 15:05.800
"You probably
already heard about

15:05.866 --> 15:07.200
"the ordeal of one young man

15:07.266 --> 15:10.333
"who recently survived
a harrowing real life nightmare

15:10.400 --> 15:13.033
"until last night, that is..

15:13.100 --> 15:16.133
Last night Randy Jennings died."

15:17.266 --> 15:18.666
Umm..

15:18.733 --> 15:21.100
Well, you know, folks

15:21.166 --> 15:23.033
somebody is trying to play
some games with me here

15:23.100 --> 15:25.600
but it isn't gonna work,
so, we'll be right back

15:25.666 --> 15:27.266
after these messages.

15:27.333 --> 15:28.433
'Go to commercial.'

15:28.500 --> 15:30.066
Conniving son of a bitch!

15:30.133 --> 15:32.800
Charlie, Charlie,
the station wants the show.

15:32.866 --> 15:34.466
I don't care
what they want, man.

15:34.533 --> 15:36.866
Look, nobody makes me look
like an idiot. You are fired.

15:36.933 --> 15:38.100
I thought you were a pro.

15:38.166 --> 15:39.266
Well, maybe I'd look..

15:39.333 --> 15:41.033
Maybe I'd look like one
with a different producer.

15:41.100 --> 15:42.100
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

15:42.166 --> 15:43.733
Well, let me tell you something,
we promoted

15:43.800 --> 15:45.300
the hell out of
"Dreams That Kill."

15:45.366 --> 15:47.733
Now, it's time to make goo
on what we promised.

15:47.800 --> 15:49.066
We're doing the show..

15:49.133 --> 15:51.100
...with or without you.

15:54.166 --> 15:57.300
Oh, you slimeball.

16:00.466 --> 16:02.933
Okay, okay, I'll do it.
Give me a minute.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.900
I'll run a clip we put together
on Randy Jennings.

16:04.966 --> 16:06.266
And you got exactly

16:06.333 --> 16:08.066
four and a half minutes
to pull it together.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.600
Cue up the Jennings clip, guys.

16:09.666 --> 16:11.800
'Alright, let's go.
You heard him'

16:11.866 --> 16:14.300
Yeah, maybe we should do
a show on blackmail sometime.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.966
Hey, somebody wanna fix
that light?

16:51.033 --> 16:54.400
This place looks like the
"No Tell Motel" for God's sake.

16:54.466 --> 16:55.933
Hey, you, buddy.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.933
What's the matter, you hard
of hearing or something?

16:59.833 --> 17:03.000
I warned you
not to do this show.

17:03.066 --> 17:04.800
Look, can we talk?

17:08.833 --> 17:10.400
What are you gonna do?

17:13.766 --> 17:15.200
Light up your life!

17:27.533 --> 17:29.800
We'll be coming out of
commercial break in 15 seconds.

17:31.766 --> 17:32.833
What's going on?

17:32.900 --> 17:35.600
I don't know,
must be a short somewhere.

17:35.666 --> 17:38.300
Oh, God! He's fallen asleep.

17:38.366 --> 17:39.800
Charlie, you okay?

17:41.400 --> 17:42.400
'Oh, my God,
he's been electrocuted.'

17:42.466 --> 17:43.400
Don't touch him.

17:43.466 --> 17:45.433
Turn off the power
down here. Now!

17:47.366 --> 17:49.033
Charlie, can you hear me?

17:49.100 --> 17:50.066
Charlie!

17:51.500 --> 17:54.033
'I wonder what happened to him.'

18:09.400 --> 18:10.766
I know it's difficult.

18:10.833 --> 18:12.433
But try to take comfort
in knowing that

18:12.500 --> 18:15.533
he's feeling absolutely no pain.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.633
Are you sure about that, doctor?

18:17.700 --> 18:19.300
He keeps twitching.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.600
That's a strictly
involuntary reaction.

18:22.766 --> 18:24.900
No, Mr. Nichels
is in a deep coma.

18:26.300 --> 18:28.233
Wh-when is he
gonna come out of it?

18:30.933 --> 18:32.633
He is gonna get better,
isn't he?

18:34.000 --> 18:36.800
I wouldn't hold out
too much hope for that.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.800
I'm sorry.

18:42.433 --> 18:43.800
Charlie.

18:57.966 --> 18:59.566
Well, well, well.

18:59.633 --> 19:02.966
How's my favorite patient today?

19:03.033 --> 19:07.966
It's time
for your physical, Charlie.

19:08.033 --> 19:10.466
My instruments are ready.

19:10.533 --> 19:14.133
Yes. Now, you must
turn your head.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.200
And cough!

19:24.933 --> 19:28.233
Our next patient represents
a most interesting case.

19:28.300 --> 19:31.033
Mr. Nichels was electrocuted
in a freak accident

19:31.100 --> 19:33.200
while performing on television.

19:33.266 --> 19:34.666
Vital signs remain weak

19:34.733 --> 19:37.633
while beta brain wave activity
is moderate.

19:37.700 --> 19:39.566
Patient is
unresponsive to treatment

19:39.633 --> 19:42.600
and his condition continues
to deteriorate steadily.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.300
'Frankly, I don't know how
he's hung on as long as he has.'

20:02.033 --> 20:04.200
'How's it going, Charlie?'

20:04.266 --> 20:07.133
Ready to test
the old reflexes?

20:13.866 --> 20:15.533
Not bad, huh?

20:15.600 --> 20:17.200
'Say, aah!'

20:20.900 --> 20:25.300
Looks like them little tonsils
are gonna have to come out.

20:27.333 --> 20:29.300
Oh, yeah.

20:31.433 --> 20:34.133
Now, bed shock.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.766
Take a deep breath.

20:35.833 --> 20:37.833
And hold it.

20:48.866 --> 20:50.200
Are there any further questions
regarding

20:50.266 --> 20:52.500
the patient's condition?

20:52.566 --> 20:53.500
Let's move on.

20:54.566 --> 20:55.833
Dr. Weiss, look at this.

20:55.900 --> 20:58.133
It's a surge
of alpha wave function.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.733
That's highly unlikely, doctor.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.300
Well, take a look for yourself.

21:03.133 --> 21:04.433
'Those patterns
look like the kind'

21:04.500 --> 21:06.900
'we see in
sleep therapy patients.'

21:06.966 --> 21:09.866
'Charlie Nichels has been in
level three coma for weeks.'

21:09.933 --> 21:12.666
Alpha activity is impossible
in his condition.

21:12.733 --> 21:15.200
Then how do you explain
the readings?

21:15.266 --> 21:18.233
I can't except that the monitor
needs re-calibration.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.400
He's dreaming.

21:21.466 --> 21:23.800
Doctor, you're not being trained
to jump to conclusions.

21:23.866 --> 21:26.233
- But how else could--
- 'Dr. Weiss, please call 800.'

21:26.300 --> 21:29.300
'Dr. Weiss,
please call 800 stat.'

21:29.366 --> 21:31.600
There's an emergency in the OR.

21:31.666 --> 21:33.000
Come with me, doctors.

21:33.066 --> 21:35.233
Time to actually apply
what you've learned.

21:37.833 --> 21:39.066
Doctor, did you hear your page?

21:39.133 --> 21:40.333
Yeah, what's the situation?

21:40.400 --> 21:42.766
Head trauma came in,
motorcycle accident.

21:42.833 --> 21:44.633
And he wasn't wearing
a helmet, right?

21:44.700 --> 21:46.600
At 60 miles an hour.

21:46.666 --> 21:48.233
Damn it!
When will they ever learn?

21:48.300 --> 21:50.533
'Dr. Weiss,
please call 800 stat.'

22:12.566 --> 22:15.033
There's not much else
I can do.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.066
What's the prognosis, doctor?

22:17.133 --> 22:21.400
That another 18-year-old boy
won't see his 19th birthday.

22:21.466 --> 22:23.766
But his vital signs
seems so strong.

22:23.833 --> 22:26.033
Yes, pulmonary and
blood chemistry are normal

22:26.100 --> 22:29.133
but I'm afraid, there's damage
to the left cranial nerve.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.833
Which means he will be incapable
of most cognitive function.

22:32.900 --> 22:35.066
And God knows what else.

22:35.133 --> 22:36.600
Sew him up, doctor.

22:40.033 --> 22:42.033
Dr. Weiss..

22:42.100 --> 22:43.866
...I have an idea,
have you considered

22:43.933 --> 22:46.633
the possibility of forced
cell regeneration?

22:47.700 --> 22:49.133
Don't be ridiculous.

22:49.200 --> 22:52.366
Look...in one room, you have
a terminal comma patient

22:52.433 --> 22:55.133
with healthy brain waves,
but no chance of survival.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.300
And now you have this boy
in desperate need

22:57.366 --> 22:59.266
'of those healthy brain cells.'

22:59.333 --> 23:02.533
What you're talking about is
brain matter transplantation.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.200
That's science fiction.

23:04.266 --> 23:08.100
The regeneration of lobe tissue
has shown fantastic potential.

23:08.166 --> 23:10.366
This is a hospital, doctor.
Not a research lab.

23:10.433 --> 23:11.900
You are obviously unaware
of the work

23:11.966 --> 23:14.100
they are doing in Argentina.

23:14.166 --> 23:17.033
I've read the literature,
thank you.

23:17.100 --> 23:19.566
Dr. Erwin, what you're
suggesting is complicated

23:19.633 --> 23:22.833
and problematic at best,
not to mention unethical

23:22.900 --> 23:24.866
and possibly illegal.

23:24.933 --> 23:29.133
It's only been attempted on
animals and with mixed results.

23:29.200 --> 23:32.800
Fine, if that's your position
doctor, then you can tell

23:32.866 --> 23:35.200
the boy's family that their son,
isn't worth attempting

23:35.266 --> 23:37.733
the only procedure
that might save his life.

24:22.266 --> 24:25.033
How are we tonight,
Mr. Nichels?

24:25.100 --> 24:26.700
May I call you Charlie?

24:28.133 --> 24:30.733
Uh, I feel like I know you after
seeing you so much on the tube.

24:32.933 --> 24:34.900
We're a lot alike,
you and I.

24:40.433 --> 24:42.466
Guys who aren't free
to tell the establishment

24:42.533 --> 24:44.600
to take a flying leap.

24:44.666 --> 24:45.866
Right?

25:43.466 --> 25:45.233
Mark Lindstorm.

25:46.966 --> 25:48.633
We haven't met.

25:50.033 --> 25:52.466
My name is Dr. Erwin.

25:52.533 --> 25:55.300
And I'm here to give you a
chance to make medical history.

25:56.900 --> 25:58.833
It's a two way street, kid

26:00.233 --> 26:02.166
Your job..

26:02.233 --> 26:04.200
...is to accept these
healthy brain cells.

26:05.466 --> 26:07.433
My job is to get famous
when you do it.

26:09.033 --> 26:11.300
So let's both hope
this works, shall we?

26:33.033 --> 26:35.000
Alright, Mark.
Follow my hand.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.166
Can you tell us your name?

26:44.233 --> 26:48.000
- I'm Mark Steven Lindstorm.
- 'What's five times six?'

26:48.066 --> 26:50.766
- 'Thirty.'
- What's five times thirty?

26:50.833 --> 26:53.333
- Hundred and fifty.
- And what's 30 times 150?

26:55.000 --> 26:56.666
I'm gonna need a calculator
for that one, doc.

26:59.966 --> 27:02.433
Well, Dr. Erwin,
you seem to have done wonders

27:02.500 --> 27:03.866
'with our young friend.'

27:03.933 --> 27:06.733
Well, thank you.
I...I'm glad you approve.

27:06.800 --> 27:09.633
I didn't say I approve. You
still have a lot to answer for.

27:10.866 --> 27:12.933
But I can't deny
the transformation

27:13.000 --> 27:14.933
that's taken place
over the last few weeks.

27:16.466 --> 27:17.933
Congratulations.

27:22.233 --> 27:24.000
So, Dr. Weiss wasn't too happy
that I got well, huh?

27:24.066 --> 27:25.200
No, it's not that.

27:25.266 --> 27:27.200
It's just that sometimes
older doctors

27:27.266 --> 27:29.900
aren't quite so willing to take
a chance on a new thing.

27:29.966 --> 27:31.833
Yeah. Well, I'm glad,
you were.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.233
It's my job.

27:33.300 --> 27:36.033
- Wait, wait a second.
- What? What?

27:36.100 --> 27:37.933
I just had
a really weird feeling.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.800
Who's room is this?

27:39.866 --> 27:41.900
Ah, nobody's at the present.

27:41.966 --> 27:44.533
Uh, used to belong to
Charlie Nichels

27:44.600 --> 27:45.800
'The talk show host.'

27:45.866 --> 27:48.100
Charlie Nichels?

27:48.166 --> 27:50.000
I had a feeling
it was his room.

27:51.566 --> 27:53.033
Where is he?
I'd like to meet him.

27:55.566 --> 27:58.100
He, uh, he passed away.

27:59.366 --> 28:01.400
Last night.

28:02.966 --> 28:05.166
Well, wait a second.
Who's that?

28:05.233 --> 28:06.866
'That's Charlie's girlfriend.'

28:15.500 --> 28:17.433
Britt?

28:18.766 --> 28:19.833
Yes?

28:21.600 --> 28:24.033
I-I guess I thought you were
someone else. I'm sorry.

28:26.233 --> 28:28.200
How did you know
my name was Britt?

28:30.966 --> 28:32.200
I don't know.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.800
Look, I'm sorry
I bothered you.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.233
Hi, honey.

29:01.366 --> 29:03.200
Oh, hi.

29:03.266 --> 29:05.233
I guess we do know each other.

29:06.933 --> 29:09.233
I thought you might need some
help staying awake.

29:10.966 --> 29:12.133
You did?

29:13.700 --> 29:17.100
'Well, I guess that
wouldn't be such a bad idea.'

29:19.666 --> 29:20.866
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait a second.

29:20.933 --> 29:22.500
My brother, Wally,
put you up to this, didn't he?

29:22.566 --> 29:24.533
'This-this is a joke, right?'

29:25.833 --> 29:28.266
Unh-unh.

29:28.333 --> 29:30.533
I've never been more serious
in my life.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.166
Ah, I was hoping
you'd say that.

30:15.133 --> 30:17.366
- Ma!
- Sorry to wake you, darling.

30:17.433 --> 30:19.233
They're letting me
take you home today.

30:19.300 --> 30:21.266
Isn't that nice?

30:21.333 --> 30:23.533
Hey, that's-that's terrific, ma!

30:27.400 --> 30:31.533
Well, everybody certainly is
excited about seeing you.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.766
Your friends have all been
calling the house.

30:33.833 --> 30:35.166
They can't wait to come over.

30:35.233 --> 30:37.800
And of course, the neighbors
want to stop by too.

30:37.866 --> 30:39.500
That's great, ma.

30:46.133 --> 30:48.866
Mark, what in the world
are you doing?

30:48.933 --> 30:50.266
I'm not doing anything.

30:50.333 --> 30:52.133
'When did you start smoking?'

30:52.200 --> 30:54.233
'Put that out this instant.'

31:07.533 --> 31:09.800
You're certainly
full of surprises, today.

31:10.966 --> 31:13.066
Never thought I would live
to see the day

31:13.133 --> 31:14.833
when you listen to classical.

31:14.900 --> 31:16.666
What, you have a problem
with that too?

31:16.733 --> 31:18.333
'Of course not, dear.'

31:18.400 --> 31:21.000
Just that you always said, if it
didn't have electric guitar

31:21.066 --> 31:23.066
it wasn't music.

31:23.133 --> 31:24.300
Yeah, well.

31:24.366 --> 31:25.800
I changed my mind, alright.

31:26.933 --> 31:28.300
Alright.

31:29.366 --> 31:30.600
- Ma, turn here.
- What?

31:30.666 --> 31:31.833
Would you just do what I say?

31:31.900 --> 31:34.200
Mark, what is wrong with you?

31:34.266 --> 31:36.566
Maybe you should've stayed in
the hospital a little longer.

31:36.633 --> 31:38.600
Could you just pull in here?

31:43.900 --> 31:46.200
Where are you going?

31:46.266 --> 31:49.400
Relax, ma.
I'm...I'm alright. Really.

31:49.466 --> 31:51.000
Why don't you go on home..

31:51.066 --> 31:52.333
...and I'll see you later?

31:52.400 --> 31:53.500
Okay?

31:53.566 --> 31:54.900
Mark!

32:08.733 --> 32:10.833
Can I help you with something?

32:10.900 --> 32:12.600
Yeah, yeah.
I'm here to do the show.

32:12.666 --> 32:14.800
You're here to audition.
How old are you?

32:14.866 --> 32:16.333
How old are you, hotshot?

32:16.400 --> 32:18.633
Here, fill up one of these
and get in line.

32:18.700 --> 32:20.633
Thanks, Evan.

32:26.366 --> 32:27.800
'Next.'

32:34.933 --> 32:36.533
Hi there.

32:38.133 --> 32:40.100
What are you doing here?

32:41.266 --> 32:43.066
I was hoping
maybe you could tell me.

32:43.133 --> 32:46.233
'Hi, and welcome to the new
"Springwood Confidential."'

32:46.300 --> 32:48.333
I'm your new host,
George Nemchek

32:48.400 --> 32:51.033
and what a wonderful new time,
we're going to have together.

32:51.100 --> 32:52.533
Next.

32:57.833 --> 32:59.533
Can you believe
this station gang?

32:59.600 --> 33:03.033
I mean, come on, having a calico
for a TV talk show host?

33:03.100 --> 33:04.933
'Gimme a break,
what do they think that'

33:05.000 --> 33:06.600
'any jerk walkin' in
off the street'

33:06.666 --> 33:09.066
is gonna be able to
handle this gig?

33:09.133 --> 33:11.133
I mean, who do they think
that they're kiddin'?

33:11.200 --> 33:13.000
Don't they realize that
this job requires at least

33:13.066 --> 33:14.833
a third grade education?

33:14.900 --> 33:15.866
Cut!

33:15.933 --> 33:16.866
Thank you for coming, everybody.

33:16.933 --> 33:18.800
The auditions are over.

33:18.866 --> 33:21.333
What's the deal, Evan? Come on.
I was just warming up.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.900
How do you know my name?

33:22.966 --> 33:25.500
Lucky guess. Come on, you cut
off my audition at the knees.

33:26.700 --> 33:29.666
Look, I've heard enough.
You got the job.

33:29.733 --> 33:32.533
Oh, by the way, you do an
uncanny Charlie Nichels.

33:36.433 --> 33:38.800
Charlie Nichels?

33:44.600 --> 33:45.700
I gotta tell you folks.

33:45.766 --> 33:48.333
Sitting with me now
are two amazing people.

33:48.400 --> 33:49.966
Dr. Erwin and Dr. Weiss.

33:50.033 --> 33:51.866
Now, these are the folks
who took care of me

33:51.933 --> 33:53.200
when I was in the hospital.

33:53.266 --> 33:55.900
And Dr. Erwin here, is
personally responsible for

33:55.966 --> 33:59.300
restoring a part of my brain
that was damaged beyond repair.

33:59.366 --> 34:01.433
And we're just as pleased
as you are, Mark.

34:01.500 --> 34:04.266
Yeah, I'm sure,
you got paid for it.

34:04.333 --> 34:06.666
But no, seriously.

34:06.733 --> 34:08.700
What you folks did
is-is a miracle.

34:08.766 --> 34:10.266
And I know there are lot of
people out there

34:10.333 --> 34:12.100
who'd like to know exactly
how you did it.

34:12.166 --> 34:14.466
Unfortunately,
that's not possible, Mark.

34:14.533 --> 34:16.433
- Oh, here we go.
- Let me finish.

34:17.633 --> 34:20.366
The procedure Dr. Erwin
used needs more research

34:20.433 --> 34:21.833
before it can be tried again.

34:21.900 --> 34:23.066
That's your opinion, doctor.

34:23.133 --> 34:26.600
One minor episode is hardly
conclusive. You got lucky.

34:26.666 --> 34:28.100
Luck had nothing to do with it.

34:28.166 --> 34:30.100
- I am a trained--
- Oh, you're a fraud.

34:30.166 --> 34:31.866
You know nothing
about medicine.

34:31.933 --> 34:33.366
Oh, aren't you such an expert!

34:33.433 --> 34:35.066
You know, you can't
even put on your own scrubs--

34:35.133 --> 34:36.766
That's it,
I'm gonna take you up

34:36.833 --> 34:38.300
on formal charges
with the AMA.

34:38.366 --> 34:40.400
'You're not gonna be allowed to
practice this voodoo medicine.'

34:40.466 --> 34:42.833
- 'Is that a threat?'
- 'That's a promise.'

34:42.900 --> 34:44.700
'You can just go right
ahead to the AMA'

34:44.766 --> 34:46.166
'because I'm gonna put you on..'

34:53.700 --> 34:56.000
I thought,
I killed you already, Nichels.

34:57.166 --> 34:58.766
- Hey, who are you?
- Who are you?

34:58.833 --> 35:01.100
This is supposed to be
Charlie Nickels' dream!

35:01.166 --> 35:03.200
I'm not Charlie Nickels.
I'm-I'm Mark Lindstrom.

35:04.566 --> 35:06.700
What the hell?
As long as I'm here..

35:08.700 --> 35:11.333
I kinda like this, killing
two jerks with one stone.

35:13.266 --> 35:14.700
'Mark? Mark?'

35:14.766 --> 35:16.000
Oh, what happened?

35:16.066 --> 35:18.800
You lapsed into a state
of impenetrable somnolence.

35:18.866 --> 35:19.833
What?

35:19.900 --> 35:21.133
You were in some kind of trance.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.166
You were there
for a while and finally

35:22.233 --> 35:23.366
had to dub out of the show.

35:23.433 --> 35:25.133
What do you remember, Mark?

35:25.200 --> 35:26.833
Wait a minute.
What you guys didn't see it?

35:26.900 --> 35:28.000
See who?

35:28.066 --> 35:29.566
The crazy guy,
who snuck up behind me

35:29.633 --> 35:32.033
and tried to kill me.

35:32.100 --> 35:33.900
He said, he was supposed
to be in Charlie Nickels' dream

35:33.966 --> 35:36.200
whatever that means.

35:36.266 --> 35:37.800
Oh, my God!

35:37.866 --> 35:40.233
Freddy.

35:40.300 --> 35:42.666
Charlie was having
exactly the same nightmares.

35:42.733 --> 35:44.533
- 'He was?'
- There's your proof, doctor.

35:44.600 --> 35:45.866
You went too far.

35:45.933 --> 35:48.466
You said, doctor, one
episode is hardly conclusive.

35:48.533 --> 35:49.866
W-w-wait, what are you guys
talking about?

35:49.933 --> 35:51.533
'You were injected
with brain cells'

35:51.600 --> 35:53.166
taken from Charlie Nickels.

35:53.233 --> 35:57.033
Unfortunately, Dr. Erwin took
them from the occipital lobe

35:57.100 --> 35:58.766
'the dream center of the mind.'

35:58.833 --> 36:00.966
'The proper procedure
would have been to'

36:01.033 --> 36:03.233
transplant cells
from the parietal lobe.

36:03.300 --> 36:04.766
The center
for conscious thought.

36:04.833 --> 36:06.633
That's great, I mean,
no wonder everybody thought

36:06.700 --> 36:08.900
I was acting
like Charlie Nickels.

36:08.966 --> 36:10.166
You even gave me his nightmares.

36:10.233 --> 36:12.133
Look, look, this could be
an isolated incident.

36:12.200 --> 36:13.666
Let's not overreact.

36:13.733 --> 36:16.100
I'm gonna see to it that you
never practice medicine again.

36:16.166 --> 36:17.766
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wait a second.
What about me?

36:17.833 --> 36:19.266
I mean, I'm the one who's got
this guy runnin' around

36:19.333 --> 36:20.700
inside my head, huh.

36:20.766 --> 36:22.833
'Uh, y-y-you gotta give me
an antidote.'

36:22.900 --> 36:24.900
There is no antidote, Mark.

36:26.533 --> 36:29.100
At this point, all we know
is that Charlie's cells are

36:29.166 --> 36:31.300
multiplying in your brain..

36:31.366 --> 36:34.266
...and there's no way
to stop them.

36:47.100 --> 36:48.033
What are you doing?

36:48.100 --> 36:50.033
Uh, flushing out
your circulatory system

36:50.100 --> 36:51.433
in hopes that
the fresh blood will have

36:51.500 --> 36:53.966
a cleansing effect
on your brain cells.

36:54.033 --> 36:57.100
This may make
you a little dizzy..

36:58.266 --> 36:59.433
'...or light-headed.'

36:59.500 --> 37:01.533
Okay, just as long as
it doesn't make me go to sleep.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.266
If you gotta go

37:48.333 --> 37:50.133
you gotta go.

37:50.200 --> 37:53.500
And, now, it's your turn.

37:54.433 --> 37:56.300
Umm-mm.

38:02.433 --> 38:04.733
I hate the caramel ones.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.000
One of these?

38:12.666 --> 38:14.200
Help me!

38:15.733 --> 38:16.766
Somebody help me.

38:43.266 --> 38:46.233
There's only one cure for me,
buddy boy..

38:46.300 --> 38:47.533
...you gotta die.

38:56.866 --> 38:58.633
Unh-unh-mm.

38:58.700 --> 39:00.333
Mm-mm-mm.

40:31.933 --> 40:33.900
- Mark, for God's sake.
- Shut up, doc.

40:35.266 --> 40:36.766
There's only one thing
I want to hear from you

40:36.833 --> 40:39.000
and that's what you're
gonna do for an antidote.

40:39.066 --> 40:41.466
We've already told you, Mark.
There isn't an antidote.

40:41.533 --> 40:42.866
You said,
you were looking into it.

40:42.933 --> 40:44.666
You said, you were
running tests in the lab.

40:44.733 --> 40:46.433
We're running those tests but

40:46.500 --> 40:48.333
this isn't an overnight thing.

40:48.400 --> 40:50.066
It could take months,
it could take years

40:50.133 --> 40:51.600
before we find
a way to reverse

40:51.666 --> 40:53.600
the spurt of those cells
in your brain.

40:55.166 --> 40:56.766
Wrong answer, doc.

40:56.833 --> 40:58.100
Mark..
God!

40:58.166 --> 41:00.833
Don't you think this situation
is killing me inside.

41:02.600 --> 41:05.266
Not as much
as it's going to.

41:05.333 --> 41:08.233
Mark? Mark! Wait!

41:08.300 --> 41:09.366
'Listen.'

41:09.433 --> 41:10.933
'You've proved
your point, Mark.'

41:11.000 --> 41:12.700
'You've really motivated me,
I'm gonna get in the lab'

41:12.766 --> 41:14.433
'and I'm gonna
find that antidote.'

41:14.500 --> 41:15.866
Please, listen.

41:15.933 --> 41:18.166
Mark, I know I can do it too.

41:18.233 --> 41:20.366
I think, we're very, very
close to unlocking the secret

41:20.433 --> 41:21.566
of this thing.

41:21.633 --> 41:23.566
Honestly, seriously, Mark.

41:23.633 --> 41:25.466
I think we're probably
just a matter of days

41:25.533 --> 41:27.133
before we give you something.

41:27.200 --> 41:29.133
Now, you understand why
we didn't tell you, don't you?

41:29.200 --> 41:31.033
'We just didn't want you
to get your hopes up'

41:31.100 --> 41:32.366
'too soon.
That's all.'

41:32.433 --> 41:35.466
Mark, please,
please, please, please.

41:35.533 --> 41:36.866
Do you know what it's like

41:36.933 --> 41:38.100
Do you have any idea

41:38.166 --> 41:41.200
what it's like
having him inside your head?

41:41.266 --> 41:44.366
- Everywhere you turn--
- No, no, I can imagine.

41:44.433 --> 41:46.400
No, you can't imagine.

41:48.300 --> 41:49.600
But you will.

41:49.666 --> 41:52.166
No! No!

41:52.233 --> 41:53.400
I figure it's only right
that I should

41:53.466 --> 41:55.200
have some company, no?

41:55.266 --> 41:56.466
And who better than you?

41:56.533 --> 41:58.966
'You're the man,
who made me what I am today.'

41:59.033 --> 42:01.900
Mark, Mark, please don't.
Mark, please don't.

42:01.966 --> 42:03.766
'This is how you did it, right?'

42:03.833 --> 42:05.433
'Straight into the ear?'

42:06.700 --> 42:08.133
Welcome to Freddy's fun house.

42:15.400 --> 42:16.733
Ah-h-h.

42:16.800 --> 42:19.466
Music to my ears.

42:21.300 --> 42:23.233
I guess, that guy
just learned something

42:23.300 --> 42:25.600
they don't teach
in medical school.

42:29.366 --> 42:31.333
An apple a day..

42:32.666 --> 42:35.400
...won't keep Freddy away!

42:35.466 --> 42:38.933
Uh-uh, not on your life.
