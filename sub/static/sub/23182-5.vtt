07:58.300 --> 07:59.466
From now on,

07:59.500 --> 08:01.400
$20 fine,
every game and praccy

08:01.433 --> 08:03.466
'til she's
shaved down to the wood.

08:03.500 --> 08:06.833
As bald as a Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtle, Shoresey!

08:06.866 --> 08:09.366
‐SHORSEY: Tit‐fucker.
‐(SIGHS)

08:09.400 --> 08:11.366
On to the second order
of business.

08:11.400 --> 08:14.266
‐Hmm. Hmm.
‐Hmm. Boomtown.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.933
There are certain things
that stand directly in the way

08:16.966 --> 08:18.233
of a team coming together.

08:18.266 --> 08:19.500
There are certain things
that stand

08:19.533 --> 08:21.233
in the way of W's, buddy.

08:21.266 --> 08:24.033
And if you truly want
this team to come together...

08:24.066 --> 08:27.000
And if you want this team
to get W's...

08:27.033 --> 08:29.166
We're gonna need
to see your junk, buddy.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.833
Don't feel bad.

08:30.866 --> 08:32.833
There are junk hiders
on every team.

08:32.866 --> 08:36.500
But I think I speak for the
entire room when I say...

08:36.533 --> 08:38.000
What are you
hiding down there, bud?

08:38.033 --> 08:39.933
Something weird going on
down there, bud?

08:39.966 --> 08:42.100
Again, don't feel bad.

08:42.133 --> 08:43.833
I mean, some teams have guys

08:43.866 --> 08:45.366
that don't even shower
after praccy,

08:45.400 --> 08:46.933
which is worse than bush.

08:46.966 --> 08:49.400
But, we see
you face the wall in the room

08:49.433 --> 08:50.866
when your junk's out,

08:50.900 --> 08:52.000
and you face the wall
in the shower

08:52.033 --> 08:53.466
when your junk's out.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.300
You've seen my junk.
Let's see your junk, buddy.

08:56.333 --> 08:57.866
‐Pull it out, buddy.
‐Whip it out, buddy.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.133
Let's have a look
at your junk.

08:59.166 --> 09:00.233
Unsheathe it, bro.

09:04.866 --> 09:06.333
(HOT TUB BUBBLING)

09:06.366 --> 09:08.766
You ever got in someone's car
in your wet swim trunks

09:08.800 --> 09:10.433
and had them turn on
the seat warmers?

09:10.466 --> 09:11.866
No.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.166
Kinda makes you
feel like you've peed.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.333
You know, big brother,

09:14.366 --> 09:15.800
that's almost not worth
talkin' about.

09:15.833 --> 09:17.733
‐Over 'n out.
‐Ooh.

09:19.766 --> 09:21.766
(GROWLING) Oh, great!

09:21.800 --> 09:23.133
Well, there's
fuckin' Tony the Tiger.

09:23.166 --> 09:24.900
‐Hey, Dad.
‐You know what?

09:24.933 --> 09:26.766
I got bigger fish
to fry tonight.

09:30.166 --> 09:32.033
Hi, Bonnie.

09:32.066 --> 09:33.400
‐Hi, Bonnie.
‐Hi, Wayne.

09:33.433 --> 09:34.933
‐How're ya now?
‐Good. And you?

09:34.966 --> 09:36.733
‐Not s'bad.
‐Any good dad noises

09:36.766 --> 09:38.300
‐on the way in?
‐DAN: No.

09:38.333 --> 09:39.800
You know what, we've really
got all the personalities

09:39.833 --> 09:41.200
on display in this hot tub.

09:41.233 --> 09:43.033
Like what?

09:43.066 --> 09:44.833
Well, you got the guy who sits
with his chin in the water.

09:44.866 --> 09:46.433
‐Sure you do.
‐Then you got the guy who sits

09:46.466 --> 09:48.166
‐with their shoulders out.
‐Sure you do.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.366
Then you got the guy
who takes up

09:49.400 --> 09:51.033
two to three times more
real estate

09:51.066 --> 09:53.266
than everybody else
because they're just like...

09:53.300 --> 09:56.233
‐Puttin' the vibe out there.
‐Sure you do.

09:56.266 --> 09:58.033
And of course
you've got your edge sitters.

09:58.066 --> 09:59.233
That's me, Wayne.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.000
What's your story
over there, hands?

10:03.033 --> 10:04.433
I'm the guy
who keeps his hands dry

10:04.466 --> 10:06.900
so he can still dig out
and light smokes.

10:06.933 --> 10:08.066
What if it's
an outdoor hot tub?

10:08.100 --> 10:09.366
Don't your hands get cold?

10:09.400 --> 10:11.133
I'm also the guy
who would never admit

10:11.166 --> 10:12.733
that sort of thing.

10:12.766 --> 10:14.500
What about you
keep one hand out of the water

10:14.533 --> 10:16.333
to dig out smokes
and I'll keep one hand

10:16.366 --> 10:18.966
out of the water
so I can light them.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.400
More hands make less work.

10:22.300 --> 10:25.933
‐You're all right, Rosie.
‐So, Bonnie...

10:25.966 --> 10:27.966
What are you
looking for in a guy?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.900
I don't really have a type,
I don't think.

10:29.933 --> 10:31.833
Okay, but if you

10:31.866 --> 10:34.266
had to choose between
someone who was...

10:34.300 --> 10:36.100
More big and hairy...

10:36.133 --> 10:38.833
Versus somebody who's
a lot less big and hairy,

10:38.866 --> 10:40.733
but more pale.

10:40.766 --> 10:43.033
Which... Which way
are you leaning towards there?

10:43.066 --> 10:44.866
Like, muscly big?

10:44.900 --> 10:46.366
(STRAINING) Yeah. Muscly big.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.966
Well, that's generous.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.500
Oh, they're
in there somewhere.

10:49.533 --> 10:52.433
And I like hairy versus, like,
groomed or manscaped.

10:52.466 --> 10:54.166
But how hairy?

10:54.200 --> 10:56.000
‐I could grow a beard.
‐No, you can't.

10:56.033 --> 10:57.100
‐Can, too.
‐Cannot.

10:57.133 --> 10:58.766
‐Can, too. Can, too!
‐Cannot.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.900
Well, I can always
shaves my beard, easy‐peasy.

11:00.933 --> 11:02.500
Or evens get a haircut.

11:02.533 --> 11:04.866
Let's take about 80% off her
over there, Squirrelly Dan.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.800
Yeah, sure.
Hey, look, bubbles!

11:06.833 --> 11:09.466
Bonnie, what are you
looking for in a relationship?

11:09.500 --> 11:11.400
I kinda like
being single right now.

11:11.433 --> 11:13.133
‐Humor me.
‐I don't know.

11:13.166 --> 11:14.933
I've never really
been in love.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.166
Okay, let's get
this ball rolling.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.200
(CLEARS THROAT) Wayne. Rosie.

11:18.233 --> 11:20.266
What's the key
to making this look so good?

11:20.300 --> 11:22.200
‐BOTH: Space.
‐Like, distance?

11:22.233 --> 11:23.500
Not distance.

11:23.533 --> 11:25.866
Although distance makes
the heart grow fonder.

11:25.900 --> 11:27.733
‐Just space.
‐Space.

11:27.766 --> 11:29.000
So you don't wanna get like...

11:29.033 --> 11:30.066
BOTH: Sick of each other.

11:31.066 --> 11:32.466
Example.

11:32.500 --> 11:36.500
I like to read, a lot.
I like to stay in and read.

11:36.533 --> 11:38.400
It's not easy telling a guy
you don't want to see him

11:38.433 --> 11:40.066
because you want to stay in
and read.

11:40.100 --> 11:43.233
Let's test this theory.
Dary...

11:43.266 --> 11:47.000
Say you asked Bonnie McMurray
out on a date and she says...

11:47.033 --> 11:49.200
I'm going to stay in and read.

11:49.233 --> 11:50.733
‐She up to somethin'.
‐Dan?

11:50.766 --> 11:52.133
Oh, she's
definitely up to something.

11:52.166 --> 11:54.000
‐Wayne?
‐Must be a pretty good book.

11:54.533 --> 11:55.766
Must be like...

11:57.400 --> 12:00.733
‐The Road.
‐Uh, no.

12:00.766 --> 12:02.033
Still suspicious of that.

12:02.066 --> 12:04.366
Yeah, wouldn't that
make you... Wary?

12:04.400 --> 12:07.466
No reason not to trust her
'til she gives you one, bud.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.033
You know, Bonnie,

12:09.066 --> 12:11.166
I had my first girl phase
around your age.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.066
Let's see it, bud.

12:25.100 --> 12:26.400
Is something weird
going on there, bud?

12:29.866 --> 12:31.366
Boom! $20 fine!

12:32.966 --> 12:34.033
Fisky.

12:35.833 --> 12:38.100
‐What?
‐What?

12:38.133 --> 12:40.000
Oh, I don't know what kind of

12:40.033 --> 12:41.733
pre‐tyke, sub‐amateur hour

12:41.766 --> 12:43.900
Teenage Mutant Ninja
fucking Turtles organizations

12:43.933 --> 12:45.366
you guys have played for
in the past,

12:45.400 --> 12:49.166
but don't step on the logo
is straight fuckin'...

12:49.200 --> 12:52.333
‐It's basic.
‐Don't step on the logo.

12:52.366 --> 12:55.700
Live for the logo,
respect the logo!

12:57.033 --> 12:59.300
‐Fisky.
‐Then why is it on the floor?

12:59.333 --> 13:01.433
That brings me
to my next point.

13:01.466 --> 13:03.900
‐Your jerseys.
‐Oh, yo, buddy.

13:03.933 --> 13:05.266
You should call it
a sweater, buddy.

13:05.300 --> 13:08.066
‐Don Cherry's orders.
‐Don Cherry, buddy.

13:08.100 --> 13:11.800
Your sweater never ever
touches the floor.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.200
Hang up the sweater.

13:13.233 --> 13:14.866
Live for the sweater.

13:14.900 --> 13:17.733
‐Respect the sweater.
‐Mmm.

13:17.766 --> 13:19.366
REILLY: Boomtown!

13:19.400 --> 13:21.100
You're not off the hook, bud.
Do you want us to trust you?

13:21.133 --> 13:22.500
Do you want this team
to come together?

13:22.533 --> 13:24.900
‐You want a fuckin' W?
‐Yeah!

13:24.933 --> 13:26.466
Then we're gonna need
to see your junk, buddy.

13:26.500 --> 13:27.933
Let's see your junk, buddy.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.800
‐Mmm‐hmm.
‐You know what?

13:31.833 --> 13:33.866
‐Team exercise? Team exercise.
‐Yeah. Yeah.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.866
All right, boys, everybody up.

13:35.900 --> 13:37.733
Trousers down,
junks out, boys.

13:37.766 --> 13:39.733
‐Lets help a teammate.
‐Junks out, boys.

13:56.100 --> 13:58.066
‐(SLAP SHOT BANGS)
‐Is...

13:59.033 --> 14:00.800
Someone on the ice, bud?

14:00.833 --> 14:02.200
That's our ice, buddy.

14:02.233 --> 14:04.800

don't move, pheasants.

14:06.966 --> 14:08.333
(INHALES DEEPLY)

14:08.366 --> 14:09.933
So, Bonnie,

14:09.966 --> 14:11.466
what has a guy have do
to get your attention?

14:11.500 --> 14:14.933
I don't know.
Make me laugh, I guess.

14:14.966 --> 14:16.833
BOTH: Turn off the bubbles.

14:19.366 --> 14:20.800
(CHURNING STOPS)

14:22.033 --> 14:23.200
Hey, Bonnie,
have you ever seen

‐It Came from Beneath the Sea?
‐No.

‐You have now.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.800
That was well brought up,

14:34.833 --> 14:36.233
‐too bad you weren't.
‐(CHUCKLES)

14:36.266 --> 14:38.133

stole my joke there.

14:38.166 --> 14:39.333

14:39.366 --> 14:40.733
I'm very funny's

14:40.766 --> 14:42.900
‐and I have lots of jokes.
‐Okay.

14:42.933 --> 14:45.733
Hey, Bonnies, what's another
word for champagne?

14:45.766 --> 14:48.266
Um. Oh, bubbly.

‐If you say so.

14:57.966 --> 15:00.400
(CHUCKLES) You're funny, Katy.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.500
That was funny, Dan.
It was almost as funny

15:02.533 --> 15:04.766
as the first time
that I heard it.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.933
BOTH: Youse shouldn't fart
in front of girls.

15:06.966 --> 15:08.066
That was my joke, Dan.

15:08.100 --> 15:10.100
You stole my joke, didn't you?

Don't you interrupt me.

15:15.333 --> 15:17.900
‐I swear I will... Stop...
‐(BUBBLING CONTINUES)

15:17.933 --> 15:19.366
Stop it, right now!

15:19.400 --> 15:21.166
‐I... Just quit it.
‐Okay, enough!

15:21.200 --> 15:23.200
‐Please.
‐And thank you.

15:23.233 --> 15:25.933
You're not so funny,
are you now, Dary?

15:25.966 --> 15:27.800
How's that book comin' along?

15:27.833 --> 15:29.033
I miss that book.

15:29.066 --> 15:30.166
Did you hear
they're still searching

15:30.200 --> 15:31.833
for the Loch Ness monster?

15:33.200 --> 15:36.066
(LAUGHING) And she's migrated.

15:36.100 --> 15:38.266
Ooh...

15:38.300 --> 15:41.866
Funny, I thought
these were Ogopogo waters.

15:41.900 --> 15:43.333
Guess they are.

15:43.366 --> 15:46.200
Don't make me come over there,
Dan, because I...

15:46.233 --> 15:48.966
If you do that
one more time... Just...

15:49.000 --> 15:50.233
Wink at me again, I...

the button again, Katy?

‐What's that?

16:11.233 --> 16:12.900
‐Tanis.
‐What's a Tanis?

16:12.933 --> 16:15.233
Well, aren't you
a little bundle of sass.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.500
You better watch
your little tongue

16:16.533 --> 16:18.400
before I flick you
with my womanhood.

16:18.433 --> 16:21.400
Did your balls drop
finally, Skiddo?

16:21.433 --> 16:23.033
Feel a little fur
on your nut sack?

16:23.066 --> 16:25.166
'Cause that is the only logic
I can think of

16:25.200 --> 16:28.333
behind why you chodes would
terrorize this whole town

knowing that Wayne
would think it was us.

16:30.533 --> 16:33.233
Although I am a self‐admitted
glutton for punishment...

16:34.533 --> 16:36.800
It never crossed my mind.

16:36.833 --> 16:38.800
I will wipe
that smirk off your face

16:38.833 --> 16:41.466
like pixie dust over there

16:41.500 --> 16:43.066
‐It was just once! I...
‐STEWART: Hey!

16:43.100 --> 16:44.300
No, you were passed out.

16:44.333 --> 16:45.866
‐ROALD: I was...
‐I said stop it!

16:45.900 --> 16:47.333
I was just trying to help.

16:47.366 --> 16:49.000
All right, I need to get
to the bottom of this first.

16:49.033 --> 16:50.300
What, do you, like,
hang out with these losers?

16:50.333 --> 16:53.200
‐Which losers?
‐Peter Pan and Tinker Bell.

16:53.233 --> 16:54.800
They're giving you drugs,
aren't they?

16:54.833 --> 16:56.233
What makes them losers?

16:56.266 --> 16:57.933
Trust me, tart. You don't
want me to answer that.

16:57.966 --> 17:01.366
‐Tart?
‐That's what I said. Tart.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.400
‐Intriguing.
‐What is?

17:03.433 --> 17:05.066
Well, the psychology
at work here.

17:05.100 --> 17:07.500
Yeah, fuckin' right.
It's called intimidation.

17:07.533 --> 17:09.100
No, it isn't.

17:09.133 --> 17:10.933
It's called projection.

17:10.966 --> 17:12.000
Okay, it didn't take me
very long

17:12.033 --> 17:13.500
to realize I don't like you.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.933
‐My mother's a psychologist.
‐TANIS: 'Kay.

17:15.966 --> 17:18.000
You harbor guilt
over your promiscuous impulses

17:18.033 --> 17:19.333
so you can call me a tart.

17:19.366 --> 17:20.900
That's projection
of the sexual feelings

17:20.933 --> 17:22.333
you're attempting to hide.

17:22.366 --> 17:24.366
‐Poorly.
‐For who?

17:24.400 --> 17:25.466
For Stewart.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.933
You like Stewart?

17:26.966 --> 17:28.800
‐No!
‐And you two...

17:28.833 --> 17:31.466
You call my friend Roald here,
Tinker Bell and pixie dust

17:31.500 --> 17:34.200
because you're uncomfortable
with your own sexualities.

17:34.233 --> 17:35.466
His open homosexuality

17:35.500 --> 17:37.333
makes you feel
even more uncomfortable.

17:37.366 --> 17:39.333
That actually
kind of makes sense.

17:39.366 --> 17:41.366
‐No, it doesn't!
‐Yours kind of makes sense.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.333
No, it doesn't.

17:43.366 --> 17:46.466
Let's try an exercise.
Hug Roald.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.400
See how it makes you feel.

17:48.433 --> 17:49.900
You might be surprised.

17:49.933 --> 17:51.266
‐No!
‐No.

17:51.300 --> 17:54.166
Roald, help them out.
Encourage them.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.233
Like... Like, I hug them?

17:56.266 --> 17:58.233
A big hug.

17:58.266 --> 18:00.800
‐Can I be in the middle?
‐Ugh!

18:00.833 --> 18:02.333
It may be
distressing at first,

18:02.366 --> 18:05.200
but you owe it
to yourselves to try.

18:05.233 --> 18:06.700
You could be so happy.

18:08.233 --> 18:11.466
‐Uh‐huh.
‐We should try, too, Tanis.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.866
(CHUCKLES) Fuck, no.
I'm warning you, Skiddo.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.700
Whoa! Second warning.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.133

really a psychologist?

the team together.

19:36.066 --> 19:38.066
And get W's, buddy.

19:38.100 --> 19:40.866
Maybe the entire time...

19:40.900 --> 19:43.366
We just needed
to add some grit, buddy.

like to get a fuckin' W?
