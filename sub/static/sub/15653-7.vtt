[grunts]

00:05.937 --> 00:07.772
Please, don't!

00:07.872 --> 00:09.874
Don't hurt me!

00:09.974 --> 00:12.211
I was only trying to feed!

00:12.311 --> 00:13.378
Please, don't!

00:13.477 --> 00:14.998
[culebra panting]

00:17.049 --> 00:20.185
Lively one, isn't he, Mister...?

00:20.284 --> 00:21.385
Normus.

00:23.153 --> 00:25.223
Dixie Normus.

00:25.847 --> 00:30.496
Yes, he does look quite delectable,
if I don't say so myself.

00:45.176 --> 00:46.944
Brothers and sisters,

00:47.045 --> 00:49.047
Xibalba is coming.

00:49.146 --> 00:53.317
And many of us are wondering
how we are going to survive.

00:53.417 --> 00:56.354
But we won't just survive,

00:56.454 --> 01:00.324
we'll be our Queen's
instrument of change.

01:00.425 --> 01:05.229
[applause]

01:16.039 --> 01:18.009
[grunts]

01:18.110 --> 01:19.310
We're <i>familia!</i>

01:19.411 --> 01:21.513
We're culebras!

01:21.613 --> 01:24.283
There are smart culebras...

01:24.383 --> 01:26.818
and dead culebras.

01:26.919 --> 01:28.520
[soft laughter]

01:28.619 --> 01:31.990
We serve the great Itzpa.
Itzpa serves Amaru.

01:32.089 --> 01:34.091
She is her majesty's soul gatherer,

01:34.191 --> 01:36.428
and by serving her,

01:36.527 --> 01:39.931
we'll be granted a place
in Xibalba when it comes.

01:40.789 --> 01:44.937
And you are a sacrifice for Amaru.

01:45.556 --> 01:50.241
[onlookers] Itzpa. Itzpa. Itzpa...

01:50.342 --> 01:52.377
[chanting continues]

01:55.345 --> 01:57.548
[screaming]

02:03.086 --> 02:06.557
To Xibalba! To Amaru! To Itzpa!

[sighs]

02:48.132 --> 02:49.335
You mind?

02:50.168 --> 02:52.404
Can you sit the fuck down already?

02:52.503 --> 02:55.539
No, I can't, Richard.
That's the whole point, all right?

02:55.639 --> 02:57.642
I'm tired of sitting down,
waiting for the next attack.

02:57.743 --> 02:59.543
We need to be making a move right now.

02:59.644 --> 03:02.080
Look, it says right here, when
the Lords first crossed over,

03:02.180 --> 03:04.383
they were "possessed of Xibalba."

03:04.934 --> 03:06.251
That sounds like what happened to me.

03:06.351 --> 03:08.353
I swear to God, I don't even know
why you bother with that shit.

03:08.453 --> 03:10.155
None of it makes any sense.

03:10.255 --> 03:12.223
Yeah, it's easy for you to say.
It didn't happen to you.

03:12.323 --> 03:15.126
Let's just focus on what's gonna
happen to her now, all right?

03:15.227 --> 03:17.592
And how we hit her back. Hard.

03:17.691 --> 03:20.298
The first thing you gotta do
is get your house in order.

03:20.399 --> 03:22.884
You need to mend fences with the Ranger.

03:22.983 --> 03:25.503
Look, Mr. White Hat was pretty clear.

03:25.603 --> 03:27.638
- He does not want to see me.
- Richard's right.

03:27.739 --> 03:29.174
We gotta let him cool off.

03:29.274 --> 03:32.411
Oh, God damn it. See?
This is why I got out.

03:32.931 --> 03:37.080
Assholes like you making a big
deal about being part of a crew,

03:37.181 --> 03:40.118
and then as soon as a man
goes down, you leave him behind?

03:40.217 --> 03:42.054
I'd be happy to have him back.

03:45.675 --> 03:48.345
Oh, fuck you two. I'll get him myself.

03:48.793 --> 03:50.235
Yo.

03:51.162 --> 03:53.264
Where you going, birdman?

03:53.364 --> 03:56.067
I was just about
to call a family meeting.

03:56.168 --> 03:59.304
I... have a juicy lead.

04:00.051 --> 04:01.273
Somehow I doubt that.

04:01.372 --> 04:03.274
Oh, yeah, dickweed?

04:03.843 --> 04:05.077
How about this:

04:05.176 --> 04:10.618
a cult of filthy rich culebras
worshipping a Xibalban.

04:11.149 --> 04:12.351
A cult?

04:12.450 --> 04:14.286
One of my co-eds told me about it.

04:14.386 --> 04:15.754
Most of them are posers,

04:15.853 --> 04:18.723
but the core group, they mean business.

04:18.824 --> 04:20.192
They're legit.

04:20.769 --> 04:22.726
And they're worshipping this Xibalban,

04:22.827 --> 04:25.731
not exactly sure who yet,

04:26.177 --> 04:28.767
but they're trying to get in the good
graces of the queen bee.

04:32.122 --> 04:33.437
Get in how?

04:33.538 --> 04:35.607
They're scalping culebras

04:35.706 --> 04:38.432
with a Xibalban blade
so they don't heal.

04:39.211 --> 04:42.314
And then they offer 'em up
to Amaru for a feeding.

04:44.698 --> 04:46.685
- When?
- There's another one tonight.

04:48.066 --> 04:49.620
No way Amaru is gonna show up for that.

04:50.066 --> 04:52.791
It's a long shot.
But they have a leader.

04:52.891 --> 04:58.130
He's a bit of a... a blowhard,
but I think if we get him,

04:59.269 --> 05:00.804
he could take us to Amaru.

05:03.864 --> 05:09.240
Professor, I never
thought I'd say this...

05:09.341 --> 05:10.642
but good work.

05:10.742 --> 05:12.277
It's what I do.

05:12.377 --> 05:14.246
I'm done pulling punches with her.

05:14.346 --> 05:15.480
What are we gonna do?

05:16.635 --> 05:17.785
Whatever it takes.

05:18.350 --> 05:19.943
But you're gonna sit
this one out in the car.

05:20.042 --> 05:20.988
- What?
- All right?

05:21.089 --> 05:22.487
We need a getaway driver anyway.

05:22.586 --> 05:24.089
I told you, I'm fine.

05:24.189 --> 05:25.123
Yeah, and I told you,

05:25.223 --> 05:26.824
I can't be worried about you...

05:26.925 --> 05:29.494
going rogue again, all right?

05:29.593 --> 05:30.829
Professor, you're gonna be my wing man.

05:33.264 --> 05:36.535
All right. Let's get ready to party.

05:57.448 --> 06:00.251
- Again, already?
- Mm-hmm.

06:02.392 --> 06:04.128
Slow down, <i>soldado.</i>

06:13.404 --> 06:17.808
You know, we've been holed up in here
a whole day since we left that dive.

06:19.843 --> 06:24.248
I still barely know you... Ranger.

06:25.750 --> 06:28.286
I told you, I'm not good to know.

06:28.385 --> 06:31.388
Yeah, that's not mysterious at all.

06:37.194 --> 06:38.863
You, um...

06:38.964 --> 06:41.266
you did let a couple of things
slip last night.

06:41.365 --> 06:42.466
Did I now?

06:48.406 --> 06:51.776
That girl you were crazy about...

06:51.875 --> 06:54.279
got herself killed.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.315
She didn't get herself killed.

07:06.891 --> 07:07.893
So...

07:09.843 --> 07:11.515
what happened to her?

07:12.802 --> 07:13.955
I shouldn't have said anything.

07:14.227 --> 07:16.224
You also talked about your wife...

07:16.567 --> 07:17.800
Margaret?

07:18.792 --> 07:20.095
And your daughter.

07:20.738 --> 07:23.455
You having to keep them
in hiding and everything.

07:24.337 --> 07:26.744
Look, I know cops
get into bad shit, okay?

07:26.844 --> 07:30.975
But what... what kinda
<i>porquería</i> are you into?

07:32.585 --> 07:33.914
You have no idea.

07:34.685 --> 07:36.921
You sure they're okay where they are?

07:37.649 --> 07:38.755
I hope so.

07:43.426 --> 07:44.426
Stay here.

08:04.861 --> 08:07.231
I thought I told you
and those pricks to stay away.

08:13.524 --> 08:15.327
[groans]

08:15.427 --> 08:17.362
[coughs]

08:17.461 --> 08:19.957
Hey, no. No, no, no!
Hey, Solaya, come back!

08:20.056 --> 08:22.533
[groans] You son of a bitch.

08:22.634 --> 08:25.437
[chuckles] I was worried about you, kid.

08:25.536 --> 08:28.372
I guess you were doing just fine.

08:29.020 --> 08:30.542
[vomits]

08:32.543 --> 08:34.846
[Tanner chuckles]

08:48.426 --> 08:52.564
This is some serious
<i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> shit, Professor.

08:52.663 --> 08:54.633
Yeah, I just hope the kid
got in all right.

09:13.116 --> 09:16.353
[chains rattling]

09:20.990 --> 09:22.927
[soft grunt]

09:23.761 --> 09:25.663
Gentlemen, hors d'oeuvres?

09:26.128 --> 09:27.431
Ah ha ha!

09:27.532 --> 09:30.735
The service around here is excellent.

09:31.969 --> 09:34.339
You see those gray hoods?

09:34.438 --> 09:36.875
You mean the muscle? I counted three.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.811
We'll take the cult leader
out back to Richie.

09:42.812 --> 09:44.749
[frustrated sigh]

09:44.849 --> 09:46.751
I'm the fucking driver now?

09:46.851 --> 09:48.952
Treats me like a goddamn sick child.

09:50.654 --> 09:51.822
[sharp grunt]

09:53.124 --> 09:55.060
[groans]

09:59.062 --> 10:00.899
[groans]

10:00.999 --> 10:03.835
<i>[eerie, indistinct whispers]</i>

10:05.341 --> 10:06.343
All right, you ready?

10:13.177 --> 10:14.446
[Scott] Holy shit.

10:15.164 --> 10:17.347
Not such a long shot after all.

10:18.883 --> 10:20.618
All right, gents, change of plans.

10:20.717 --> 10:23.681
Scott, you and I will
take out the cult monkeys

10:23.781 --> 10:26.124
and surround the redhead.
Professor, you create a diversion.

10:26.224 --> 10:27.625
[Amaru] On your feet.

10:40.770 --> 10:43.440
My Queen... we did not expect you.

10:43.540 --> 10:47.644
Itzpa serves me well.
A true daughter of Xibalba.

10:50.095 --> 10:52.716
She says you have
something special for me.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.986
Yes. Yes, of course we do.

11:23.847 --> 11:25.516
That was special.

11:25.616 --> 11:26.985
- [gunshot]
- [onlookers cry out]

11:27.085 --> 11:30.021
All right, everybody. Party's over.

11:30.120 --> 11:33.057
[panicked chatter]

11:36.092 --> 11:38.062
[indistinct shouts]

11:42.066 --> 11:43.902
A stake-gun won't hurt me.

11:44.001 --> 11:47.137
Last time I checked,
you weren't bulletproof.

11:50.206 --> 11:53.043
Shoot me and I'll take her soul.

11:53.144 --> 11:54.546
[gasping]

11:54.645 --> 11:56.079
[gunshot]

11:56.179 --> 11:57.181

[Seth grunts]

12:11.662 --> 12:14.466

12:20.037 --> 12:22.974

12:23.073 --> 12:26.543
[speaking Xibalban] Men are scum!

12:28.312 --> 12:32.917
[furious cries]

12:34.317 --> 12:37.521
She just showed up? Without Brasa?

12:37.621 --> 12:39.223
That doesn't make any sense.

12:40.409 --> 12:41.211
Seth.

12:43.159 --> 12:44.995
We could end this whole thing right now.

12:46.163 --> 12:47.865
No Queen, no hell on earth.

12:50.067 --> 12:51.214
No nothin'.

12:51.313 --> 12:52.836
Yeah, but we can't kill her.

12:52.937 --> 12:54.309
So, what do we do?

12:54.772 --> 13:00.745
[wind howls]

13:04.181 --> 13:06.894
Whatever we do,
I say we do it somewhere else.

13:06.993 --> 13:08.919
Yeah, the kid's right. Right about now,

13:09.019 --> 13:11.343
whoever those assholes were
praying to has figured out

13:11.443 --> 13:13.024
that we have crashed their party.

13:13.124 --> 13:15.192
She's gonna tear you to shreds.

13:15.293 --> 13:16.260
[teeth clack]

13:16.360 --> 13:17.794
We need a hideout.

13:18.796 --> 13:20.388
Someplace nobody knows about.

13:21.032 --> 13:24.202
I know. We'll take her
where the two rivers meet.

13:36.245 --> 13:38.917
Ultimate hair of the dog, my friend.

13:39.016 --> 13:42.686
Actually, the hair of a two-headed
hellhound, but who cares?

13:48.826 --> 13:50.161
[sighing] Yeah.

13:50.260 --> 13:51.466
Ugh.

13:52.196 --> 13:54.032
I am not drinking that.

13:54.754 --> 13:56.733
You know, I know how you feel.

13:56.833 --> 13:58.320
You don't know shit about how I feel.

13:58.420 --> 13:59.871
Hey, I loved her, too,

14:00.058 --> 14:01.598
before you were even a glimmer

14:01.698 --> 14:04.096
in your great-great- grandpappy's eye.

14:04.196 --> 14:07.466
Ximena and I were... untamed.

14:07.566 --> 14:10.836
She was my gazelle, I was her buffalo.

14:10.936 --> 14:13.773
I killed her with my own hands,
you miserable son of a bitch.

14:15.908 --> 14:18.075
And whatever Richie did to me...

14:18.978 --> 14:20.963
it was like I could see everything.

14:21.714 --> 14:22.874
Feel it.

14:25.618 --> 14:27.619
But I couldn't stop myself.

14:28.174 --> 14:29.955
Well, that's why I'm here.

14:30.237 --> 14:34.527
To tell you that you need to leave
those wounds on the battlefield.

14:34.627 --> 14:37.931
[ringtone plays]

14:38.956 --> 14:41.066
[Burt] Yo, Marv. How you doin', buddy?

14:42.788 --> 14:44.103
They did what?!

14:44.202 --> 14:47.840
The Gecko boys, man. They got a girl
here who's having a bad trip.

14:47.941 --> 14:49.776
[speaking Xibalban] This is my realm!

14:49.875 --> 14:52.544
You will burn in hell!

14:52.644 --> 14:54.581
Out of the way, Spicoli.

14:54.681 --> 14:57.083
[Burt] <i>Marvin, what the hell
is going on there?</i>

15:00.219 --> 15:03.089
- <i>God damn it. Put that tall one on.</i>
- Tall one?

15:05.658 --> 15:06.526
What?

15:13.132 --> 15:15.101
I just figured out
what we can do with her.

15:15.201 --> 15:17.236
You're wasting your time.

15:20.105 --> 15:23.009
All right. Burt says
to stick her in the pen.

15:26.611 --> 15:27.946
The pen?

15:28.047 --> 15:30.115
She must be one of those
demons from hell,

15:30.215 --> 15:32.851
'cause I've never seen Burt
use the cage before.

15:34.986 --> 15:36.722
Is this the best you can do?

15:36.822 --> 15:39.024
This ain't gonna hold her.

15:39.124 --> 15:40.893
No, take a closer look, man.

15:40.994 --> 15:43.129
Burt scorched the floor with a ring
of Xibalban bone marrow

15:43.229 --> 15:44.831
to help keep hellspawns trapped.

15:44.931 --> 15:46.232
[Seth] What?

15:46.331 --> 15:48.201
Transportin' them
to the Labyrinth and all that.

15:48.301 --> 15:50.802
So this is Ilhicamina's cage.

15:51.996 --> 15:53.096
Huh.

15:56.374 --> 15:59.211
<i>[eerie, indistinct whispers]</i>

16:00.946 --> 16:01.947
Richie, what's up?

16:04.350 --> 16:05.884
You okay, buddy? What happened?

16:08.988 --> 16:11.691
Hey! Hey, buddy, are you okay?

16:11.791 --> 16:13.593
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- What's the matter, Richie?

16:13.692 --> 16:16.995
Not feeling quite like yourself lately?

16:17.095 --> 16:18.664
Just need some air.

16:18.764 --> 16:21.634
You'll need a lot more than air.

16:21.734 --> 16:23.036
[cries out]

16:23.135 --> 16:26.105
[Amaru pants]

16:28.139 --> 16:29.708
Hey, what happened back there?

16:29.808 --> 16:32.077
- Nothing, I... I slipped.
- Slipped?

16:33.379 --> 16:34.581
Bullshit.

16:36.882 --> 16:38.105
All right, look.

16:39.185 --> 16:42.287
Ever since the asylum,
it's like I can hear them sometimes.

16:42.388 --> 16:45.325
In my head. Like a frequency
I can tap into.

16:46.534 --> 16:49.430
Earlier at the mansion,
I think I saw her coming...

16:50.897 --> 16:52.864
and just now, it was like
she was calling for help.

16:52.965 --> 16:55.335
- Calling who?
- Fuck if I know, I just heard it.

16:55.435 --> 16:57.936
What the fuck does that even mean?

16:58.037 --> 16:59.839
God damn it, Richard, not now.

17:01.172 --> 17:03.276
We gotta focus on her right now.

17:04.276 --> 17:05.912
Professor says he's got a plan.

17:06.011 --> 17:07.244
You mean short of killing her.

17:07.345 --> 17:08.748
That's not gonna happen.

17:08.847 --> 17:10.749
Okay, just relax, kid.

17:10.848 --> 17:12.050
Don't tell me to relax.

17:12.151 --> 17:14.787
Whoa, whoa. Easy, fellas.

17:14.886 --> 17:18.223
Ol' Burt's got everything
we need to perform...

17:18.324 --> 17:20.759
a good old-fashioned exorcism.

17:20.858 --> 17:23.194
What? Bongs full of holy water?

17:23.296 --> 17:25.664
No. No, nothing that tired.

17:25.765 --> 17:27.733
The ancient <i>Ritual de los Bacabs.</i>

17:27.834 --> 17:32.337
And if we do it right, we might
just cast away the soul of Amaru

17:32.438 --> 17:35.141
and save Katey-Kakes. Forever.

17:36.208 --> 17:37.588
Will it hurt her?

17:37.687 --> 17:40.412
Well... we'll have to keep
an eye on that.

17:40.512 --> 17:42.714
No. No way.

17:42.815 --> 17:44.249
You got any better ideas?

17:51.723 --> 17:53.393
Then exorcism it is.

17:53.492 --> 17:56.162
[heavy cart rattles]

17:56.261 --> 17:58.263
Well, here she is.

17:58.364 --> 18:01.834
Pride and joy of Tomás de Torquemada.

18:01.933 --> 18:06.806
According to Burt, Cortés himself
brought this baby across.

18:06.905 --> 18:08.707
Jesus Christ, Professor.

18:10.409 --> 18:13.146
This is still a teenage girl
we're dealing with here.

18:15.346 --> 18:17.916
I thought you said
you were done pullin' punches.

18:18.801 --> 18:22.121
You think you can break me with pain?

18:22.220 --> 18:26.858
[wind whistling]

18:26.959 --> 18:28.894
I <i>am</i> pain.

18:28.995 --> 18:31.831
[wind rises]

18:42.106 --> 18:45.411
But I'm not the one you should
be worried about right now.

18:45.510 --> 18:46.812
Itzpa's here.

18:47.912 --> 18:49.800
You fucked up her party...

18:50.516 --> 18:54.153
and sadly for you, she hates men.

19:13.204 --> 19:15.374
<i>[otherworldly cry]</i>

19:30.588 --> 19:32.157
God damn it.

19:38.931 --> 19:42.434
[Marvin screams]

19:49.240 --> 19:51.243
[wind howling]

20:08.861 --> 20:12.864
<i>[otherworldly cry]</i>

21:02.247 --> 21:03.516
What the hell are you?

21:03.615 --> 21:06.451
I am the darkness.

21:06.551 --> 21:09.454
[cat-like snarl]

21:16.094 --> 21:19.164
[Scott grunts]

21:27.271 --> 21:30.141
[low, bestial growl]

21:33.612 --> 21:36.349
[wind howls]

21:38.828 --> 21:40.531
[Richie] Scott!

21:41.720 --> 21:43.322
Scott!

21:45.156 --> 21:48.493
- What did this to you?
- Same thing that did that to him.

22:05.437 --> 22:06.636
Fuck did you do now?

22:06.735 --> 22:09.056
- I didn't do anything.
- Yeah, somehow I don't believe that.

22:09.155 --> 22:10.877
That's not my problem.

22:26.459 --> 22:28.695
This is on you, Gecko.

22:28.789 --> 22:31.657
Who knows what kinda...
beast you've brought here.

22:38.905 --> 22:40.674
[gasping]

22:40.773 --> 22:44.511
- Oh, shit.
- What the hell?

22:44.612 --> 22:49.183
That is the mark of a clawed butterfly.

22:49.282 --> 22:52.318
Her name is Itzpapalotl.

22:54.788 --> 22:58.259
She's also known
as La Llorona, or Itzpa.

22:58.358 --> 23:00.627
At the birth of humanity,
she fell in love with a man.

23:00.728 --> 23:05.166
He lied to her, he cheated on her,
he killed their firstborn.

23:05.266 --> 23:07.902
- Oh, man. Three for three.
- Yeah.

23:08.001 --> 23:10.370
Now she lives to torment
the men of the species.

23:10.471 --> 23:13.207
You know how she does that?
With venom from her claws.

23:14.773 --> 23:16.242
Let me see that.

23:19.378 --> 23:21.814
Oh, God! What the fuck?!

23:21.914 --> 23:24.524
When the poison enters your system...

23:25.519 --> 23:28.355
it makes you relive
your darkest moments,

23:28.454 --> 23:31.424
the worst things you've ever done.
Seizures. Pain.

23:31.524 --> 23:34.627
Until you go mad. Or die.

23:38.764 --> 23:43.570
You know, if La Llorona is here
to rescue Amaru, we're in deep shit.

23:43.671 --> 23:45.239
I doubt we'll survive.

23:45.338 --> 23:47.741
You did once. Didn't you?

23:47.840 --> 23:50.578
I fought her. Lost.

23:50.677 --> 23:53.280
Lord Malvado put her in the Twister.

23:53.379 --> 23:55.248
Well, then,

23:55.348 --> 23:57.483
all we have to do is keep her
away from this exorcism.

23:59.618 --> 24:03.389
The friars believed
that stretching the body

24:03.490 --> 24:05.826
could excise the soul.

24:08.060 --> 24:11.531
You know, I was told Seth Gecko
was a gentleman thief.

24:11.632 --> 24:14.401
Well, pain is the only language
you know, right?

24:16.353 --> 24:18.240
So that's how you're gonna
tell your story.

24:18.993 --> 24:20.242
Professor?

24:20.648 --> 24:21.711
Here we go.

24:23.009 --> 24:27.580
[speaking Xibalban]
To the Mortal, the body,

24:27.681 --> 24:30.985
to the Hellspawn, the fire...

24:32.719 --> 24:34.688
So it does hurt, huh?

24:34.788 --> 24:37.558
Guess you're just gonna
have to leave that body, then.

24:37.657 --> 24:40.627
You mean like you left her
on the side of the road?

24:40.728 --> 24:43.631
You really think you're the big
bad end of the world, don't ya?

24:43.731 --> 24:46.500
But when I see you making
all these moves,

24:46.599 --> 24:48.534
sending demons out
to do your dirty work,

24:48.902 --> 24:51.672
underneath all this, uh, crazy,

24:51.771 --> 24:55.009
all I see is fear and desperation.

24:56.675 --> 24:58.511
Release this soul from our realm,
and take it to yours!

24:58.612 --> 25:00.414
You think I'm afraid of you?

25:00.513 --> 25:02.815
You had it all in that little Underworld
of yours.

25:02.915 --> 25:06.419
Slaves, absolute power, all that, right?

25:06.520 --> 25:09.690
What happened? You lost it.

25:09.789 --> 25:11.892
Now you're like a washed-up <i>capo,</i>

25:11.991 --> 25:14.427
desperate to do anything
to get back on top.

25:14.528 --> 25:19.533
Release this evil, purify her
heart, make pure her blood.

25:19.633 --> 25:21.434
Here's the thing.

25:21.535 --> 25:24.571
I know the one thing
that you're actually afraid of.

25:24.671 --> 25:26.539
What's that?

25:26.639 --> 25:27.974
Something you didn't count on.

25:30.510 --> 25:31.545
Kate.

25:33.480 --> 25:37.418
[groaning]

25:39.818 --> 25:41.754
[panting]

25:41.855 --> 25:43.656
You know she's in there.

25:43.757 --> 25:46.060
And you know she's stronger
than you are.

25:53.833 --> 25:56.036
And what about you, Seth?

25:56.965 --> 25:59.441
Do you think that saving a little girl

25:59.539 --> 26:01.442
will make you better than your brother?

26:02.156 --> 26:04.180
- Makes me better than you...
- No.

26:05.011 --> 26:07.815
It allows you to convince yourself

26:07.914 --> 26:10.616
you're not the monster
that you truly are.

26:10.716 --> 26:12.719
It allows you to lie to yourself.

26:13.405 --> 26:16.390
You feel all that hate around you?

26:16.490 --> 26:19.359
That's not me. That's her.

26:19.460 --> 26:22.962
She blames you for everything
that happened to her.

26:23.062 --> 26:24.931
Do you feel it, Seth?

26:25.031 --> 26:27.367
- Do you feel it?
- Up!

26:27.468 --> 26:33.807
[speaking Xibalban] Gods
of Xibalba, receive your daughter!

Find the spirit guides!

27:01.001 --> 27:05.939

I will find them, my Queen.

28:15.575 --> 28:16.577
Don't move!

28:22.815 --> 28:23.884
Solaya?

28:23.983 --> 28:26.086
[soft chuckle]

28:28.954 --> 28:30.057
I wanted to see you again.

28:38.263 --> 28:41.702
Jesus Christ. You were
one of them the whole time!

28:43.135 --> 28:44.805
We're the future, Peacekeeper.

28:44.905 --> 28:46.131
But why?

28:46.873 --> 28:48.674
Why take the time to seduce me?

28:48.774 --> 28:51.944
Because it's the easiest way
to destroy a man.

28:52.045 --> 28:56.750
I've known so many who think
they're pure and noble,

28:56.849 --> 28:59.139
but in their moment of truth

28:59.720 --> 29:02.823
are weak and afraid.

29:12.097 --> 29:14.768
[combat grunts]

29:20.606 --> 29:22.308
[groans]

29:22.408 --> 29:23.976
Away from him, <i>bestia!</i>

29:25.677 --> 29:26.879

29:26.980 --> 29:29.616
It's okay, soldier. I got you.

29:29.715 --> 29:31.584
But you've got a whole lot
of pain coming your way.

29:31.684 --> 29:33.819
[screaming]

29:35.120 --> 29:37.534
You can make all this stop, Princess.

29:38.991 --> 29:42.194
Just tell me what you're
up to and it's over.

29:45.865 --> 29:47.367
Okay.

29:49.935 --> 29:54.006
[Tanner speaks incantation]

29:54.106 --> 29:56.609
Kill me! Do it!

29:56.710 --> 29:59.613
You're just gonna kill your precious
little Kate, too! Do it!

30:25.203 --> 30:26.595
Back off.

30:27.473 --> 30:30.277
The only way you're getting
through here is over my dead body.

30:33.680 --> 30:35.248
I'm not gonna hurt you anymore.

30:40.453 --> 30:42.888
It's okay, <i>m'ijo,</i> it's okay.

30:42.989 --> 30:44.057
I'm here,

30:44.156 --> 30:46.193
and I have a way to stop the pain.

30:46.292 --> 30:48.260
[Amaru screaming]

30:48.360 --> 30:50.630
Oh, you're not gonna do it.

30:50.731 --> 30:53.634
You can't do anything
without your brother.

30:53.733 --> 30:55.668
You're just a sniveling coward.

30:55.769 --> 30:58.805
You are nothing without him.
You'll never be anything...

30:58.905 --> 31:01.808
Shut your fucking mouth!
You don't know a goddamn thing about me.

31:01.907 --> 31:05.846
You fuck with people I care about,
you have no idea what I'm capable of.

31:05.945 --> 31:09.750
Then show me what
you're capable of. Show me.

31:09.849 --> 31:11.083
Up!

31:11.183 --> 31:13.819
I don't think her body
can take anymore, man.

31:19.826 --> 31:21.060
God!

31:23.195 --> 31:24.764
Do you hear what they're doing?

31:25.400 --> 31:27.669
You think they care about your sister?

31:27.768 --> 31:28.869
Get away from me.

31:30.435 --> 31:32.938
You can save her, Scott.

31:35.808 --> 31:37.711
[screaming]

31:37.810 --> 31:39.111
What are you doing?!
You're gonna kill her!

No! No!

No! Stop!

[wind howling]

32:15.261 --> 32:16.494
Motherfucker!

32:16.519 --> 32:18.521
Look, just give it a moment,
give it a moment.

32:18.597 --> 32:20.598
It's really gonna help
with the seizures.

32:20.699 --> 32:22.635
Trust me, I know
what you're going through.

32:22.734 --> 32:25.770
Stop saying that. You don't know.

32:25.870 --> 32:27.071
Really?

32:28.807 --> 32:30.643
Remember I said I lost?

32:30.742 --> 32:32.877
Well, she left me with a few souvenirs.

32:37.182 --> 32:39.985
Thanks to her, I gotta
relive all my crappy moments

32:40.085 --> 32:43.122
from a long lifetime of war.

32:43.222 --> 32:45.657
Over and over again.

32:48.059 --> 32:50.995
You know what this is for?
This is medicinal!

32:51.096 --> 32:53.665
I lost a lotta great men in those wars.

32:53.765 --> 32:55.200
And I said to myself, never again.

32:56.201 --> 32:57.736
Then you jokers come along.

32:59.838 --> 33:03.509
We're not safe around you, Freddie!
You can't stay here. You can't!

33:03.608 --> 33:07.579
- I need to protect Billy!
- You'll get her killed! Get out!

Hey, hey, hey! Easy, easy.

33:13.719 --> 33:17.756
Easy, easy, brother. Easy, easy, easy.

33:17.856 --> 33:19.420
Here.

33:19.959 --> 33:21.348
Go ahead.

33:29.834 --> 33:32.533
I'm not gonna let her do
to you what she did to me.

33:45.684 --> 33:48.186
[agonized gasps]

33:49.988 --> 33:54.193
I can make it go away for good,
if you do what I ask.

34:08.039 --> 34:11.109
Oh, come on. Kate, come on...

34:11.208 --> 34:14.579
Oh, Jesus, please. Can you hear me?

34:15.379 --> 34:16.581
Come on.

34:19.882 --> 34:21.052
Yeah, that's it.

34:22.187 --> 34:24.188
Why did you do this to me?

34:24.289 --> 34:27.824
What? No, no, no. I didn't mean
to hurt you, all right?

34:27.926 --> 34:31.230
- I was just trying to break her.
- You can't beat her.

34:32.228 --> 34:33.998
She's too powerful.

34:34.098 --> 34:36.034
No. No. Fuck that. You fight.

34:36.135 --> 34:39.203
No. This was all a set-up.

34:39.303 --> 34:42.340
- She's playing you.
- What?

34:42.440 --> 34:44.009
She got caught on purpose...

34:45.743 --> 34:48.347
to distract you from
what that ghost is doing,

34:48.446 --> 34:50.915
to get to what she really wants.

34:54.985 --> 34:58.156
<i>[eerie, indistinct whispers]</i>

35:07.832 --> 35:10.035
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Margaret. Hey, it's me.

35:10.135 --> 35:11.303
Are you okay?

35:11.403 --> 35:13.772
[Margaret] <i>I'm fine, Ferdinand.</i>

35:13.872 --> 35:16.609
- Is Billy... is Billy all right?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

35:16.709 --> 35:18.143
<i>Why? Is something wrong?</i>

35:18.243 --> 35:21.347
No. I'm just checking in.

35:22.814 --> 35:24.016
You still at your dad's?

35:24.115 --> 35:25.883
<i>Why, should I not be?</i>

35:25.984 --> 35:27.819
No, no, no. Just stay at Rally Falls.

35:27.919 --> 35:29.655
Just stay at Rally Falls.

35:30.455 --> 35:31.857
I'll call you soon.

35:31.957 --> 35:34.660
<i>Goodbye, Ferdinand.</i>

35:34.760 --> 35:38.363
[speaking Xibalban]
...I found the mother and child.

35:40.098 --> 35:41.634
[Freddie] <i>Just stay at Rally Falls.</i>

35:53.144 --> 35:57.182
[wind rises]

35:57.281 --> 36:00.084
[wind falls sharply]

36:00.185 --> 36:01.438
Did you just feel that?

36:02.053 --> 36:04.022
You mean like the wind dying down?

36:04.122 --> 36:05.423
That was her leaving.

36:05.524 --> 36:07.693
What? Why would she be leaving now?

36:08.129 --> 36:09.935
'Cause she didn't come for Amaru.

36:10.918 --> 36:12.997
Then who the hell'd she come for?

36:15.033 --> 36:16.402
[Seth] Hey, hey. No.

36:16.502 --> 36:19.270
No, open your eyes. Look at me.

36:19.370 --> 36:21.773
What do you mean,
"What she really wants"?

36:23.207 --> 36:25.077
She wants the spirit guides.

36:26.877 --> 36:28.747
Spirit guides?

36:31.482 --> 36:33.084
No, no. Hey, hey.

36:33.185 --> 36:37.289
Look at me. You gotta fight,
all right? I'm sorry.

36:38.029 --> 36:40.158
I don't forgive you.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.863
[pained groans]

36:46.865 --> 36:48.200
[groaning]

36:54.339 --> 36:57.776
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You untied her restraints?!

37:03.314 --> 37:04.716
[Amaru grunts]

37:06.316 --> 37:08.286
Spirit guides... spirit guides...

37:08.386 --> 37:10.756
That's... that's
a resurrection ceremony thing.

37:10.856 --> 37:12.825
- That's a pure of hearts thing...
- What? Spit it out!

37:12.924 --> 37:15.193
Well, that's what
she was doing in Shady Glen.

37:15.294 --> 37:17.830
She's trying to get her old body back.

37:17.930 --> 37:20.399
She needs a mother and a child
to complete the ritual.

37:20.499 --> 37:21.966
[Scott] Open the gate.

37:24.334 --> 37:27.271
Let her out... Let her out now.

37:40.852 --> 37:42.354
[wind whistles]

37:54.845 --> 37:56.113
Hello?

38:00.470 --> 38:02.406
[cellphone rings]

38:02.506 --> 38:04.127
[sighs]

38:04.852 --> 38:06.987
- Hey.
- <i>Margaret! Thank God.</i>

38:07.012 --> 38:08.715
You're really starting
to scare me, Ferdinand.

38:08.814 --> 38:10.215
<i>Listen to me,
everything's gonna be okay.</i>

38:10.240 --> 38:12.324
<i>Just stay in the house.
We're on our way.</i>

38:12.648 --> 38:15.483
- On your way?
- <i>Is Billy safe? How's she doing?</i>

38:15.583 --> 38:17.419
[exhales] I'm checking now.

38:23.495 --> 38:24.560
- [thrashing sound]
- [Margaret gasps]

38:24.659 --> 38:27.362
<i>Margaret, what's going on?</i>

38:29.931 --> 38:32.068
- It's okay.
- <i>Margaret, what's going on?</i>

38:32.168 --> 38:35.371
- Nothing.
- <i>Margaret?!</i>

38:35.471 --> 38:37.606
- There's somebody in here.
- <i>Margaret!</i>

38:37.706 --> 38:38.974
Let her out now!

38:39.443 --> 38:42.275
- Scott, listen to me.
- We can't do that.

38:43.390 --> 38:44.458
Put those down.

38:45.781 --> 38:47.782
[Seth] That thing has poisoned you.

38:48.784 --> 38:51.087
No. I was out in the hallway.

38:51.186 --> 38:52.788
I heard what you were
doing to my sister.

38:52.887 --> 38:54.523
[Tanner] It had to be done.

38:54.623 --> 38:56.759
Okay, look, you're right.

38:57.858 --> 38:59.761
It got a little outta hand.

38:59.862 --> 39:01.397
These things happen with exorcisms.

39:01.496 --> 39:04.532
Let her go, or I'm gonna do it for you.

39:04.632 --> 39:07.837
Oh, really? Well, if...

39:07.936 --> 39:09.871
[Tanner chuckles]

39:31.444 --> 39:32.612
[door clangs shut]

39:33.795 --> 39:37.137
You can always count on family.

39:38.166 --> 39:39.467
[soft chuckle]

39:42.036 --> 39:43.406
[wind howls]

39:43.505 --> 39:46.541
It's okay. It's okay, baby.

39:52.147 --> 39:56.619
<i>[howling voices in the wind]</i>

40:04.993 --> 40:09.764
<i>[howling voices in the wind]</i>

40:12.601 --> 40:15.003
[gunshots]

40:25.647 --> 40:26.648
[sharp cry]

40:36.056 --> 40:38.627
No! No!

40:38.726 --> 40:40.029
[Billy] Mommy!

40:40.128 --> 40:44.567
My baby! Give me back my baby!

40:44.666 --> 40:45.701
[screaming] Let go of me!

40:49.770 --> 40:52.507
It's okay, sweetie. Don't cry.
Mama's coming, too.

40:58.063 --> 40:59.009
Let 'em go.

41:00.849 --> 41:02.976
I'm sorry, Peacekeeper, they can't stay.

41:03.075 --> 41:05.260
Especially not after you betrayed them.

41:05.947 --> 41:07.146
But I'll stick around for you.

41:07.247 --> 41:09.058
[Margaret gasping]

41:11.726 --> 41:14.230
[Margaret] Freddie! Freddie!

41:20.668 --> 41:21.837
[groans]

41:26.942 --> 41:29.043
<i>[eerie, indistinct whispers]</i>

41:33.348 --> 41:37.753
Ilhicamina. I thought
you'd forgotten about me.

41:38.655 --> 41:43.625
This time I'm gonna
forget about you for good.

41:43.726 --> 41:46.061

[snarling]

42:21.295 --> 42:23.299
[shrieking]

42:32.748 --> 42:35.176
I hope you choke on my ashes.

42:42.317 --> 42:44.686
Get up. Come on.

42:51.226 --> 42:52.628
She took my family.

42:52.728 --> 42:55.097
Ohh, then let's tear
this bitch to shreds.

42:57.132 --> 42:58.267
[shrieking]

43:01.002 --> 43:03.105
[agonized shrieks]

43:17.185 --> 43:18.253
Jesus.

43:20.355 --> 43:22.023
You two okay?

You did not die in vain.

What a lovely little girl.
