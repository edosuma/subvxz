WEBVTT

00:42.710 --> 00:46.087
It begins here for me on this road.

00:46.255 --> 00:48.923
How the whole mess happened,
I don't know.

00:49.091 --> 00:52.677
But I know it couldn't happen again
in a million years.

00:52.845 --> 00:55.471
Maybe I could have stopped it early.

00:55.764 --> 01:00.518
But once the trouble was on its way,
I was just going with it.

01:01.353 --> 01:04.980
Mostly I remember the girl.

01:05.149 --> 01:08.401
I can't explain it,
sad chick like that.

01:09.361 --> 01:13.531
But something changed in me.
She got to me.

01:14.700 --> 01:18.953
But that's later, anyway.
This is where it begins for me.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.914
Right on this road.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.107
Come on, get off the track!

03:12.693 --> 03:15.945
What are you doing?
Get over there! Come on, all of you!

03:32.129 --> 03:35.381
Now they're approaching the turn
for the last lap.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.758
Let's see, Riley and some....

03:39.177 --> 03:43.848
Hillman taking a tumble. And Jones
doing very well to avoid him too.

03:44.016 --> 03:48.144
This is the final lap coming up
and still anybody's race.

03:51.773 --> 03:56.235
That's Conners in the hay.
It's a bad break for Charlie Conners.

04:00.490 --> 04:05.202
And they'll go into the last lap.
Last time around coming up.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.455
They're all hot today.
It's anybody's race.

04:07.623 --> 04:10.708
They're in that order now,
but anything can happen.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.210
--maybe a record....

04:20.719 --> 04:25.139
Come on, Al! Come on! Come on!
Thattaboy! Come on!

04:37.194 --> 04:40.112
Hey, get off the track! Get off the track.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.323
Please don't cross the track.

04:43.533 --> 04:49.413
Please don't cross the track. Don't get
hurt. Blood makes everything slippery.

04:49.581 --> 04:51.540
What's the matter
with you chowder heads?

04:51.708 --> 04:53.918
You in such a big hurry to die?

04:55.087 --> 04:58.631
Those words mean anything to you,
squirrels? Are you looking for trouble?

04:58.799 --> 05:02.927
These outlaw outfits always want
to foul things up for everybody else.

05:03.095 --> 05:05.680
Hey, what kind of outfits?
Say that again.

05:05.847 --> 05:09.266
Outlaw outfits, like yours.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.227
Okay, square, right now.

05:11.395 --> 05:15.564
You want to drag Johnny here
100 yards for beers, or you chicken?

05:17.401 --> 05:20.111
-The square's chicken.
-They're all chicken.

05:20.278 --> 05:24.198
You want to see something?
You wanna see Johnny go?

05:24.366 --> 05:27.159
He can really go.
He can really screw it on.

05:28.245 --> 05:31.580
What do you get when you win
one of these scrambles? $5000?

05:31.748 --> 05:33.708
Boy, I'd sure like to win me $5000.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.084
Hey, you dummy, come here.

05:35.252 --> 05:38.212
If you win, they give you
one of these beautiful gold statues.

05:38.380 --> 05:41.757
-Solid gold.
-Pure solid gold. Dipped.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.468
-What do you do with it?
-Take it home to your mother.

05:44.636 --> 05:45.970
Yeah, then you throw it away.

05:46.138 --> 05:50.266
Break it up, break it up. Put these
trophies back. All of you, stand back.

05:50.434 --> 05:53.019
Hey, where can I get me
one of these jazzy suits?

05:53.186 --> 05:56.188
I want to look like
a street cleaner too.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.901
Hey, who are you? What are you
doing here? You a cop or something?

06:01.486 --> 06:02.987
Come on.

06:04.197 --> 06:08.117
-Don't push anybody.
-Okay, okay, break it up.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.244
We got enough entertainment
around here.

06:10.412 --> 06:12.872
I've seen enough of you guys
to last me forever.

06:13.040 --> 06:17.001
Now, hit the road.
I mean right now. Get going.

06:17.169 --> 06:20.629
We want to watch
the thrilling races, daddy.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.799
One more cute remark
and you won't be riding any cycles.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.135
I'll put the bunch of you away
for a month.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.012
Now, get going.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.157
Hey, fellas, come here.
Look what Johnny won.

06:48.325 --> 06:51.035
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Second place?

06:51.203 --> 06:53.079
So Johnny
only won second place, huh?

06:53.246 --> 06:56.457
What do you mean?
First place was two feet high.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.510
Hey, Johnny, look.

07:07.677 --> 07:10.805
These squares are having a dance
in Carbonville tonight. We'll go, huh?

07:10.972 --> 07:14.016
-No, man. That's nowhere.
-Come on. We can clobber it.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.897
Come on, Johnny. Let's go someplace.

07:20.065 --> 07:23.442
Let's get out of here. Every time
you look around, there's cops.

07:24.486 --> 07:27.113
All right, let's get rolling.

07:29.533 --> 07:31.492
This way.

08:03.692 --> 08:07.027
-Where's that bunch from?
-I don't know, everywhere.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.446
I don't even think
they know where they're going.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.157
Termites. Nutty.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.617
Ten guys like that give people
the idea everybody...

08:13.785 --> 08:16.912
...that drives a motorcycle is crazy.
What are they trying to prove?

08:17.080 --> 08:19.748
Beats me. Looking for somebody
to push them around...

08:19.916 --> 08:22.543
...so they can get sore
and show how tough they are.

08:22.711 --> 08:25.462
They usually find it someplace,
sooner or later.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.350
Hey, Johnny, where are we going?

10:01.518 --> 10:03.978
-Let's get gas.
-Yeah, give us some gas!

10:04.145 --> 10:06.021
Hey, gas man.

10:06.189 --> 10:09.066
Ben, business before pleasure.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.782
Jimmy,
better put some more beer on ice.

10:16.950 --> 10:21.078
What is this joint? What war do you
suppose this joint was left over from?

10:22.122 --> 10:26.583
Hey, fellas, drag for beers.
Who wants to drag for beers?

10:29.546 --> 10:32.047
Last guy in the door of that joint
buys beers.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.845
Last guy in buys.

10:55.822 --> 11:00.868
-Hey, who is it? Who is it?
-Art, you all right? It's Art Kleiner.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.286
Come on.

11:03.580 --> 11:08.834
-Hey, help this man out!
-Hey, help this man out!

11:11.129 --> 11:14.590
Help the man out! Help the man out!

11:16.301 --> 11:18.469
Put me down! Put me down!

11:20.138 --> 11:22.806
Help the man out! Help the man out!

11:27.562 --> 11:31.398
-What is all this?
-We're just dragging for beers.

11:31.566 --> 11:33.025
And this guy:

11:34.027 --> 11:36.528
-He doesn't know how to drive.
-Yeah.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.697
There's a boy hurt here.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.077
It's his ankle. Looks pretty bad.

11:44.621 --> 11:49.041
What's all that, Kathy?
What's all that? Somebody killed?

11:49.209 --> 11:51.377
Hey, Crazy,
you can't sleep in the street.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.296
Man, look at this cycle.
You really stacked up this thing.

11:54.464 --> 11:57.216
I'll call Dr. Ziegler.
Get your pickup, we'll take him over.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.510
Harry, you seen how it happened.

11:59.677 --> 12:02.096
Those motorcycles
were coming straight at me.

12:02.263 --> 12:06.433
I swung my wheel over as hard
as I could, but they-- Take a look at that.

12:06.601 --> 12:09.645
-What about this, Harry?
-It was an accident. I saw it.

12:09.813 --> 12:11.730
Mark got excited, that's all.

12:11.898 --> 12:15.442
-Aren't you gonna arrest anybody?
-Take it easy, Art. Take it easy.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.945
I'm not excited.
I'm just telling you what happened.

12:18.113 --> 12:19.822
I tried to miss him, then he hit me.

12:19.989 --> 12:23.492
My car's a wreck and somebody has
to pay for the damages, and I mean it.

12:23.660 --> 12:27.121
Okay. You the big cop in the town?

12:27.288 --> 12:30.624
Next time, tell him to look where he's
going. He don't know how to drive.

12:31.334 --> 12:34.670
I mean, he ought to turn one way
or the other. You know what I mean?

12:34.838 --> 12:37.464
There was guys all over the street
trying to miss him.

12:37.632 --> 12:41.218
-Now, just a minute--
-He's all right, but my boy's busted up.

12:41.386 --> 12:45.055
-Look here, Harry--
-Forget it, Art. Forget it.

12:45.223 --> 12:47.933
-Some cop, huh?
-See Johnny back him down?

12:48.101 --> 12:50.686
Yeah. What a screwball town.

12:52.897 --> 12:56.692
Art Kleiner's too old
to be driving an automobile.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.944
Where was he going, anyway?

12:59.112 --> 13:04.450
Always going someplace.
Crazy, excited.

13:04.617 --> 13:10.706
Taking a lot of vitamin pills, drinking.
Over-stimulated.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.669
Ought to arrest
the whole lot of them.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.089
Call the militia.

14:14.270 --> 14:18.482
-Do you want something?
-Yeah. I'd like a bottle of beer.

14:18.983 --> 14:22.486
-The beer's just in the bar.
-Alrighty.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.173
Why, thank you.

15:32.849 --> 15:35.767
Look, Harry.
The fender's scraping in the tyre.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.519
Wait a minute.

15:39.188 --> 15:42.608
There you are. It won't scrape no more.
Good as the rest of them.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.861
Oh, no. Harry, aren't you
gonna do something about this?

15:46.029 --> 15:48.780
-Well, what do you expect me--?
-What do you want Harry to do?

15:48.948 --> 15:52.034
Arrest all these boys? All 30 or 40
of them and whatever there is?

15:52.201 --> 15:55.912
It's the principle. You let something
like this go by and anything goes.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.249
-That's right. Make your complaint, Art.
-I sure will.

15:59.417 --> 16:02.336
That's silly.
Your car is okay, you're okay.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.755
And it's lucky, the way you drive.

16:22.065 --> 16:24.566
-Say, you live here all the time?
-All my life.

16:29.739 --> 16:32.324
We've been over to Carbonville,
at the meet.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.535
Bunch of motorcycles came through
this way yesterday.

16:37.163 --> 16:42.292
They didn't stop. Is that what they give
you in those races for killing yourself?

16:42.460 --> 16:44.086
That's right.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.922
You want it?

16:47.090 --> 16:49.675
-No.
-Well, go on, take it. Go ahead.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.551
-No.
-Go on.

16:51.719 --> 16:54.721
You can't do that. You won it.

16:57.225 --> 17:00.811
You have to get your name engraved
on it, whatever you do. It's important.

17:00.978 --> 17:03.772
You don't give something like that away
just like that.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.942
Not unless you knew a girl real well
and you liked her.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.904
Hey, Johnny.

17:11.321 --> 17:14.657
About this town,
they've got a doc here.

17:14.826 --> 17:19.037
They'll rewire Crazy. What are we gonna
do? Sit around and scratch ourselves?

17:19.204 --> 17:22.457
Are we gonna wait for Crazy,
or are we gonna get out of this dump?

17:24.210 --> 17:26.377
We're gonna wait for Crazy.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.805
Go.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.724
Go, go.

17:53.823 --> 17:57.492
Hey, you guys! Johnny says we're
gonna hang around and wait for Crazy.

17:57.660 --> 17:58.952
They're gonna fix him up.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.747
-What do we do here?
-Give me a swig of this, will you?

18:01.914 --> 18:06.543
Don't fight, boys. Plenty more where
this came from. It's ice-cold too.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.296
-Hey, doc.
-Yeah.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.757
Hey, where do we eat?

18:11.924 --> 18:15.135
Right there. Bleeker's Cafe.
We'll take good care of you.

18:15.303 --> 18:17.220
-You got some steaks?
-Kansas City steaks?

18:17.388 --> 18:19.639
Well, we serve good meat.

18:20.516 --> 18:24.603
-Where's the motel?
-The hotel is right over there.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.564
Hey, they've got a hotel here.

18:28.608 --> 18:33.111
-Hey, come on, lead me to that brew.
-Hey, check the hot rod.

18:36.866 --> 18:39.034
Hey, the fire went out!

19:11.067 --> 19:15.403
How are you doing, blondie?
Hey, baby. Where you going?

19:33.881 --> 19:35.465
Well, look who's here.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.848
-What'll you have, girls?
-Yeah, what will it be, girls?

19:43.015 --> 19:45.642
-The usual.
-The usual. All right, just one minute.

19:45.810 --> 19:49.563
-And hit us with a couple of beers.
-Jimmy, put a couple more cases on ice.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.314
Kathy said you wanted
some glasses.

19:51.482 --> 19:53.817
That was an hour ago.
Never mind. I'll do it myself.

19:53.985 --> 19:57.821
-Take over here, will you, Jimmy?
-Come on, Jimmy!

19:58.406 --> 20:00.448
I'm dying of thirst.
I'm dying of thirst.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.033
Please stop mumbling.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.703
Jimmy, what do you hicks do
around here for kicks?

20:04.871 --> 20:06.079
What time is it?

20:06.247 --> 20:09.165
Hey, what do you do around here?
Anything ever happen?

20:09.333 --> 20:11.626
-Oh, yes.
-Like what?

20:11.794 --> 20:15.422
-Roses grow.
-Oh, roses grow.

20:15.590 --> 20:17.382
-People get married.
-Married.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.926
Crazy as any place else.

20:20.094 --> 20:23.138
Bugs get on them,
cause trouble sometimes...

20:23.306 --> 20:25.682
-...that is, if you don't spray good.
-Yeah.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.518
-There's no bugs on you, Jim?
-I mind my own business.

20:28.686 --> 20:30.020
That's the way to be, Jim.

20:30.187 --> 20:36.359
I listen to the radio. Music, that is.
News is no good, excites people.

20:36.527 --> 20:39.654
-Hey, Jim, what about TV? You like TV?
-What?

20:39.822 --> 20:42.115
New thing, Jim. Television.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.618
-Oh, pictures.
-Yeah.

20:44.785 --> 20:49.497
No, no pictures.
Everything these days is pictures.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.666
Pictures and a lot of noise.

20:51.834 --> 20:55.962
Nobody even knows how to talk,
just grunt at each other.

21:02.637 --> 21:04.596
-Where you been?
-Working.

21:04.764 --> 21:08.183
Listen, what's happening later?
What are you gonna do later?

21:08.351 --> 21:09.392
I work.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.853
-You've got to goof off, don't you?
-What?

21:12.021 --> 21:15.273
-You're not gonna work forever, are you?
-It feels like it sometimes.

21:16.984 --> 21:20.028
I'm talking about tonight,
after you finish up?

21:20.196 --> 21:23.073
I have to stay here
as long as we're busy.

21:23.741 --> 21:26.743
It sounds like we'll be busy
until you leave here.

21:28.829 --> 21:31.206
Where are you going
when you leave here?

21:33.167 --> 21:35.377
Don't you know?

21:35.544 --> 21:37.587
Man, we're just gonna go.

21:37.755 --> 21:40.507
Just trying to make conversation.
It means nothing to me.

21:40.675 --> 21:45.220
On the weekends
we go out and have a ball.

21:45.388 --> 21:47.806
What do you do? I mean,
do you just ride around...

21:47.974 --> 21:50.016
...or do you go
on some sort of a picnic?

21:52.436 --> 21:56.731
A picnic? Man, you are too square.
I'll have to straighten you out.

21:57.942 --> 22:03.905
Listen, you don't go any one special
place. That's cornball style. You just go.

22:04.073 --> 22:09.244
A bunch gets together after all week,
it builds up. The idea is to have a ball.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.788
If you're gonna stay cool,
you've got to wail.

22:11.956 --> 22:13.707
You've got to put something down.

22:13.874 --> 22:16.459
You got to make some jive.
Know what I'm talking about?

22:16.627 --> 22:20.213
-Yeah, I know what you mean.
-Well, that's all I'm saying.

22:20.381 --> 22:23.675
My father was going to take me
on a fishing trip to Canada once.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.176
Yeah?

22:25.761 --> 22:28.930
-We didn't go.
-Crazy.

22:38.607 --> 22:39.899
Solid.

22:40.067 --> 22:43.695
Hey, pops, give me one
of those crazy beers, will you, man?

22:44.572 --> 22:47.115
-Man, that was real cool.
-Thanks, daddy-o.

22:47.283 --> 22:51.411
That's fine old playing.
We've got to get this beer.

22:51.579 --> 22:53.705
Thank you, pops.

22:53.873 --> 22:58.918
-Bop me, dad.
-I bopped you, dad. Pops, thumb me.

22:59.086 --> 23:01.254
Come on. That's it. Thumb me.

23:01.422 --> 23:04.340
-Now, give me some skin. Ooze it out.
-Ooze it out.

23:04.508 --> 23:07.427
-Just nice and-- Ooze it out.
-Thattaboy, ooze it.

23:07.636 --> 23:11.473
-Now, elbow us. Just elbow us.
-Pops, do you pick up on this jive?

23:11.640 --> 23:14.434
-What?
-Pick up on this jive? This crazy music.

23:14.602 --> 23:17.687
-Did you dig the rebop?
-What?

23:17.855 --> 23:21.858
-The rebop, dad. The rebop.
-He's a square. Don't you get this?

23:22.026 --> 23:25.945
You take the brew on the side
and the time, and you take this bottle....

23:27.656 --> 23:29.282
Drink and....

23:38.334 --> 23:44.881
Go, go, go.

23:50.179 --> 23:53.264
-How about a dance? Come on.
-How about you? You want to struggle?

23:53.432 --> 23:56.893
-Let's try.
-Thattagirl. You're a daring one.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.241
Hey, can I help you?

24:32.054 --> 24:37.225
Hey, these are keen!
Johnny, get a load of this.

24:37.393 --> 24:39.018
-They're real bells.
-Aren't they cute?

24:39.186 --> 24:40.186
Crazy.

24:40.354 --> 24:43.523
Somebody tell me what that means.
"BRMC." What does it mean?

24:43.691 --> 24:47.068
-Black Rebels Motorcycle Club.
-Isn't that cute?

24:47.236 --> 24:51.739
-Johnny, what are you rebelling against?
-What have you got?

24:54.577 --> 24:58.329
Kathy, aren't they wonderful?
Did you hear what I said?

24:58.497 --> 25:00.415
I said, "What does 'BRMC' mean?"

25:00.583 --> 25:02.959
He said,
"Black Rebels Motorcycle Club."

25:03.127 --> 25:05.545
I asked, "What are you
rebelling against, Johnny?"

25:05.713 --> 25:09.090
And he said, "What have you got?"
"What have you got?"

25:17.141 --> 25:19.350
What's the matter?
Don't you like to dance?

25:19.518 --> 25:21.352
Well, I don't dance very well.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.856
The squares are having a dance
in Carbonville. You want to make it?

25:25.024 --> 25:28.276
Aren't you Miss--?
Taken about that.

25:31.113 --> 25:34.949
-Oh, my.
-Coffee, please.

25:37.661 --> 25:39.913
Two coffees, please.

25:42.416 --> 25:44.709
-You want to go?
-I can't.

25:44.877 --> 25:48.963
-How come?
-Well, I can't. Besides, it's silly.

25:49.131 --> 25:54.510
-You just came from Carbonville.
-So what? We'll just go back over there.

25:57.014 --> 25:58.431
Hey.

25:59.016 --> 26:02.018
Hey, you gentlemen
ordered some coffee.

26:02.186 --> 26:05.855
I think you ordered some coffee.
The young lady's waiting for you.

26:06.023 --> 26:08.024
That's a good boy.

26:10.027 --> 26:11.986
What's with him?

26:21.038 --> 26:26.459
You won yourself something, did you?
Well, that's a nice souvenir to have.

26:28.087 --> 26:32.423
Look, Johnny, out there
I think you got me a little wrong.

26:32.591 --> 26:36.219
I've got a job to do,
but I'm not hard to get along with.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.222
It's generally just a misunderstanding...

26:39.390 --> 26:43.643
...but looks like anything that might
develop into real trouble....

26:44.520 --> 26:49.232
It can be decided if folks
just sit down and talk it over.

26:57.074 --> 26:58.199
Dad.

27:01.829 --> 27:05.540
Would you like me
to fix you a steak sandwich or...?

27:07.209 --> 27:08.710
No.

27:14.049 --> 27:18.261
Why did you do that for?
Why are you trying to be so rude?

27:21.265 --> 27:22.890
I don't like cops.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.353
Let's get out of here.

27:27.521 --> 27:28.646
Come on.

27:35.029 --> 27:40.742
-Did you get lined up with that chick?
-No, man. Her old man is that itchy cop.

27:40.909 --> 27:43.953
-Let's get out of this town.
-I'd like to get me a cop's daughter.

27:44.121 --> 27:45.955
Some deal, eh, Dinky?

28:02.639 --> 28:05.933
One beer,
and a sidecar for my friend.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.311
He got his clutch overhauled.

28:08.479 --> 28:10.063
-Crazy, how's the foot?
-I got it.

28:13.442 --> 28:15.902
Dig that cat, daddy-o.

28:21.241 --> 28:24.118
What are you doing tonight?

28:41.887 --> 28:45.848
Hey, the Rebels are here!
Hey, the Rebels! Come on!

28:46.016 --> 28:48.017
It looks like Johnny's here.

28:49.353 --> 28:52.480
-Come on. Let's get out of here.
-Johnny, this joint's wide open.

28:52.648 --> 28:55.316
-What's the matter? This is a bar.
-Let's get out of here.

28:55.484 --> 28:58.361
No, it's a drag. Come on.

29:18.632 --> 29:23.886
Hi, sweetheart. What are you doing
in this miserable gully, Johnny, my love?

29:27.141 --> 29:28.307
I love you, Johnny.

29:28.475 --> 29:30.351
I've been looking for you
in every ditch...

29:30.519 --> 29:32.520
...from Fresno to here,
hoping you was dead.

29:32.688 --> 29:35.731
Chino's giving him the needle,
and your boyfriend don't go for that.

29:40.070 --> 29:43.489
You've been having yourself a time,
huh, Johnny?

29:45.075 --> 29:49.996
You do look pale.
Have you been taking care of yourself?

29:50.289 --> 29:53.082
You been staying out
too late at night?

29:54.042 --> 29:55.751
That's mine, Chino. Take it off.

30:05.345 --> 30:06.971
Don't do that.

30:15.105 --> 30:16.439
That's better, Johnny.

30:18.525 --> 30:22.820
I missed you. Ever since
the club split up, I missed you.

30:22.988 --> 30:26.157
-We all missed you. Did you miss him?
-Yeah.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.701
The Beetles missed you.
All the Beetles missed you.

30:28.869 --> 30:31.078
Come on, Johnny, let's go inside,
have a beer...

30:31.246 --> 30:33.539
...and I'll beat
the living Christmas out of you.

30:33.707 --> 30:36.125
Johnny, for old times' sake.

30:37.961 --> 30:42.465
Don't take that away from Chino.
It's so beautiful.

30:42.633 --> 30:46.886
Chino needs it. It makes Chino
feel like a big, strong man.

30:47.054 --> 30:51.599
Yeah, Chino wants to be
a big racetrack hero. All these girls.

30:54.186 --> 30:57.647
I didn't win it. I just gleebed it.

30:57.814 --> 31:01.150
But I gleebed it off a guy
that didn't win it either.

31:01.985 --> 31:03.236
Look, Johnny, you want one?

31:03.403 --> 31:06.155
How about you go gleeb one
someplace for yourself, huh?

31:13.288 --> 31:15.957
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.918
This is the main event.

31:19.503 --> 31:22.004
Ladies and gentlemen....

31:22.256 --> 31:24.257
This lovely young lady over here...

31:24.424 --> 31:28.511
...shall hold this beautiful object
signifying absolutely nothing.

31:28.679 --> 31:31.973
Watch closely.
See how the timid maiden of the hill...

31:32.140 --> 31:34.225
...clutches the gold to her breast.

31:34.393 --> 31:38.938
And see how she fights back a tear while
her hero bleeds to death in the street.

31:40.524 --> 31:43.276
Come on, get up, you big hero.

31:57.457 --> 32:00.167
-What are they fighting about?
-I don't know.

32:00.335 --> 32:02.420
Don't know themselves, probably.

32:06.049 --> 32:08.676
Stop this.
I've seen hoodlums like this before.

32:08.844 --> 32:12.513
If you don't get tough with them the
minute they get out of line, you're sunk.

32:21.356 --> 32:26.402
You are the cop. If you can't boot these
jerks out, we'll have to bust a few heads.

32:26.570 --> 32:29.697
-That won't help matters.
-Take it easy, Charlie.

32:29.865 --> 32:33.284
Nothing but talk. Talk. I'll see
if everything is all right at home.

32:55.515 --> 32:59.352
Chino, come on, get up, boy.
Don't let him make a fool out of you.

32:59.519 --> 33:02.188
Go get him, Chino.
Come on, go get him! Go get him, Chino!

33:07.611 --> 33:10.571
Johnny, I love you.

33:16.328 --> 33:20.414
Johnny, how about you and me,
we'll go and have a--

33:23.460 --> 33:29.465
Shut up! Let's you and me have a beer,
Johnny. Shut up, I said!

33:35.430 --> 33:38.015
-Get out of the way. I want out.
-What's the big idea?

33:38.183 --> 33:40.518
Shut up!

33:40.686 --> 33:43.229
-You know how to drive?
-Come on, I want out of here.

33:43.397 --> 33:47.900
-You're awful noisy, ain't you?
-Now, look, you get away from me.

33:48.068 --> 33:50.986
-What did he do?
-Tried to run Meatball over.

33:51.154 --> 33:53.614
Come on, up and over!

33:53.782 --> 33:57.201
Heave, ho! Heave, ho!

33:57.744 --> 34:01.580
Break it up. Break it up. Break it up.

34:01.748 --> 34:05.960
-Chief, he tried to run Meatball over.
-Nobody ran anybody over.

34:06.128 --> 34:08.003
He ran his motorcycle
in front of my car.

34:08.170 --> 34:10.089
Yeah? And then I suppose
his cycle crawled...

34:10.257 --> 34:12.341
...under your front wheel
all by its lone self?

34:12.509 --> 34:16.011
-I want this man arrested.
-He wants me arrested? You hear that?

34:16.179 --> 34:20.683
-He hit me.
-Well, hit me back, you coward. Go on.

34:20.851 --> 34:24.478
All right, quiet! I'm gonna take
you both down and lock you up.

34:24.646 --> 34:25.771
-Both of us?
-Yes.

34:25.938 --> 34:31.025
So we can all talk
without everybody yelling. Quiet!

34:31.194 --> 34:36.031
Whether I'll hold anybody or not depends
on just how badly this boy here is hurt.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.199
See, I'm with the chief.

34:38.368 --> 34:41.411
-Are you hurt, man?
-He don't feel a thing.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.539
-Harry.
-What?

34:45.458 --> 34:49.170
-Let me talk to you.
-All right, break it up. Move along.

34:49.337 --> 34:52.630
-Do you know what you're doing?
-Of course I know what I'm doing.

34:52.799 --> 34:58.429
-Let's get these guys out of town.
-Sure. We have to make a living here.

34:58.597 --> 35:01.974
If you arrest Charlie Thomas,
he'll never forgive you.

35:02.309 --> 35:03.851
Well, okay.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.981
-Okay, come on. Come on.
-What about him?

35:09.149 --> 35:11.609
Frogface, dear friend,
we are being parted.

35:11.777 --> 35:13.944
Our love is being nipped in the bud.

35:14.112 --> 35:18.824
Wait a second. What did this boy do
that frogface didn't do?

35:18.992 --> 35:20.993
Johnny,
I want to talk to you a minute.

35:21.161 --> 35:24.622
I've given you a couple of chances.
I don't know what you're after--

35:24.790 --> 35:27.583
-Chief, let me tell you about Johnny.
-Shut up.

35:28.376 --> 35:31.587
I'm in a spot here.
You can do me a favour.

35:32.589 --> 35:35.424
You take your boys and go on,
and the other bunch too.

35:35.592 --> 35:39.136
-Can I go too, chief?
-Yeah, and he goes too.

35:39.554 --> 35:42.681
I made a deal with a cop once.

35:42.849 --> 35:44.642
Let me tell you about Johnny,
daddy-o.

35:44.810 --> 35:48.354
He's okay, but you don't get on his back.
He don't like nobody on his back.

35:48.522 --> 35:52.024
We had the same club once, and
the Beetles got on his back all the time.

35:52.192 --> 35:53.275
He didn't like that.

35:53.443 --> 35:58.072
-Then you don't wanna do what I say?
-Save me, Johnny. I'm going to the can.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.240
Yes or no?

35:59.407 --> 36:04.620
-I don't make no deal with no cop.
-Okay. Come on.

36:05.705 --> 36:10.000
Hey, Johnny, write my mother
a letter and tell her I'm in the can!

36:10.168 --> 36:13.128
Johnny, you gonna let that phoney cop
get away with this.

36:13.296 --> 36:15.214
Hey, write my mother a letter...

36:15.382 --> 36:19.468
...tell her to send me a case of beer.
Oh, the shame of it all!

36:19.636 --> 36:21.929
Oh, the shame of it all!

36:22.097 --> 36:24.890
-Let's give this joint the needle.
-What time is it?

36:25.058 --> 36:26.934
Where's that chick
that's got my gold?

36:27.102 --> 36:29.603
She was standing right over there.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.691
Hi, Johnny.

36:35.819 --> 36:36.944
Thank you.

36:37.904 --> 36:39.405
Hey, Johnny.

36:41.324 --> 36:44.785
Don't you remember? Britches.

36:45.078 --> 36:48.497
You remember. The last weekend
we went out scrambling.

36:48.665 --> 36:51.292
-Before the club split up.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

36:53.086 --> 36:56.755
-How have you been?
-I'm still swinging.

36:56.923 --> 37:01.844
I didn't know what happened to you.
It's been a year I didn't see you.

37:03.638 --> 37:07.850
-I thought about you.
-I'll see you later, okay?

37:18.320 --> 37:21.196
Where's my gold?
I'm gonna blow this joint.

37:21.364 --> 37:25.326
Fine. Go someplace else
and cause trouble.

37:25.493 --> 37:29.079
Listen, he put Chino in the can. Why
didn't he put that frogface in the can?

37:29.247 --> 37:33.500
He was afraid of making a mistake.
He's afraid of losing his job.

37:34.336 --> 37:37.171
He's the town joke and I'm stuck
with him.

37:37.339 --> 37:41.467
He hasn't got any business being a cop.
No more than you have with that.

37:41.635 --> 37:44.678
He's a fake, like you.

37:46.514 --> 37:51.560
Well, you've impressed everybody now,
big motorcycle racer.

37:51.978 --> 37:55.105
Take that back so they can give it
to somebody who really won it.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.565
Say what?

38:04.115 --> 38:07.409
Who are you, some girl
who makes sandwiches or something?

38:07.577 --> 38:10.287
Your father wears a hat
says he's a big, important man.

38:10.455 --> 38:12.373
You start telling me what to do?

38:12.540 --> 38:15.125
Nobody tells me what to do.

38:15.961 --> 38:19.588
You keep needling me, if I want to,
I'm gonna take this joint apart.

38:19.756 --> 38:21.674
You're not gonna know what hits you.

38:27.514 --> 38:30.975
-Hey, beer.
-Johnny, what's the pitch? We leaving?

38:32.894 --> 38:34.812
Not just yet.

40:54.744 --> 40:55.828
Hey, Johnny.

40:55.995 --> 40:59.081
-Johnny, come on, let's go spring Chino.
-Yeah, one phoney cop.

40:59.249 --> 41:02.167
-Let's get him out of there.
-Hey, we've got this town on the ropes.

41:02.335 --> 41:04.878
-Come on.
-All right, let's go.

41:47.088 --> 41:50.424
Hello, Dorothy,
get me the sheriff's office in Elsburgh.

41:50.592 --> 41:54.178
I'll see if I can get through
for you, Harry.

41:57.015 --> 42:01.310
Hey, look what's in here.
Hello, baby.

42:01.477 --> 42:05.189
-How does this work?
-Can I get my mother on this?

42:05.356 --> 42:07.566
-This is Dorothy. Help!
-Hello?

42:07.734 --> 42:09.860
-Hello, baby.
-How does this work?

42:10.945 --> 42:15.449
Goodbye, Dorothy.
Go on, take the day off, Dorothy.

42:32.175 --> 42:34.009
What is this?

42:36.387 --> 42:39.890
What are you doing here? Get off
my lawn! Come on, get out of here!

42:40.058 --> 42:42.809
Listen, you hooligans,
you've caused enough trouble.

42:43.937 --> 42:46.563
-Hey, Chino!
-Hey, Chino!

42:46.731 --> 42:48.982
-Hey, Chino!
-Get up, Chino.

42:49.150 --> 42:51.026
Come on, Chino!

42:53.613 --> 42:57.741
-Let's open it up.
-Hey, you guys. Look, I've got the key!

42:57.909 --> 43:00.911
-Where'd you get the keys?
-I see it.

43:01.079 --> 43:03.789
-I wore gloves. No fingerprints.
-Good.

43:03.957 --> 43:05.707
Hurry up. Hurry up.

43:05.875 --> 43:07.501
Hey, Chino, wake up.

43:07.961 --> 43:10.545
In you go. Get in there.

43:12.257 --> 43:14.508
Hey, Chino.
Chino, come on, get up.

43:14.676 --> 43:17.094
-There you go.
-Come on, Chino.

43:17.804 --> 43:20.138
Leave him alone. Let him sleep it off.

43:20.306 --> 43:23.934
Hey, you want room service?
We'll leave a call for you.

43:27.897 --> 43:29.982
Sleep well, Chino.

43:30.566 --> 43:33.360
Chino will be surprised
when he wakes up.

43:33.528 --> 43:36.488
Johnny, what happened to that cop?
Let's go give him a bad time.

43:36.656 --> 43:38.407
Yeah, I'll take the cop's daughter.

43:38.574 --> 43:42.536
-Okay, okay, I was smiling.
-Maybe she's got a sister for me.

43:43.955 --> 43:45.956
Johnny, where are you going?

44:07.186 --> 44:10.814
Hello. Hello, hello.

44:11.566 --> 44:12.566
Hello.

44:12.734 --> 44:16.153
-What's the matter? Don't they answer?
-Did you get them?

44:16.321 --> 44:19.489
The phone is dead.
Better send somebody for the militia.

44:19.657 --> 44:24.661
That's silly. Let me try.
Hello, operator. Operator.

44:24.829 --> 44:27.831
Dorothy.
I guess you're right.

44:30.460 --> 44:34.046
Kathy, go see if you can find your dad.
Tell him I need him right away.

44:34.213 --> 44:36.882
You better go home and stay there.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.389
Come on!

44:45.433 --> 44:47.392
Come on, Bleeker!

44:52.273 --> 44:54.274
Now, wait a minute!

45:22.178 --> 45:27.808
-Hi, Johnny. Where have you been?
-What do you want?

45:27.975 --> 45:31.686
Talk to me, Johnny.
Sing me a song.

45:32.522 --> 45:35.649
-Buy me a beer.
-You've got a beer.

45:35.817 --> 45:38.318
I want to know how you've been, Johnny.

45:39.612 --> 45:43.281
I'm singing tonight, Johnny.
I'm really singing.

45:43.449 --> 45:46.243
I'm on the Christmas tree.

45:50.081 --> 45:53.625
-You got a date?
-Yeah, I got a date.

45:54.168 --> 45:55.710
Johnny.

45:55.878 --> 46:00.966
Remember the night--? The first time
I went out scrambling with the Rebels.

46:01.134 --> 46:02.676
Remember?

46:03.594 --> 46:08.640
That was the first time I ever saw you.
I haven't seen you since.

46:09.392 --> 46:13.311
We really got ourselves
hung on the Christmas tree, didn't we?

46:14.397 --> 46:19.276
Boy, was I green. Was I really green.

46:19.444 --> 46:25.782
I thought I was really living it up. I had
me a guy and we were really gonna go.

46:25.950 --> 46:28.535
But we had a lot of yaks anyway,
didn't we, Johnny?

46:30.288 --> 46:34.291
Well, say it.
Can't you say something?

46:35.626 --> 46:39.880
Please, Johnny.
I won't get on your back.

46:40.047 --> 46:42.424
I wouldn't do that.

46:43.718 --> 46:47.971
But we had a lot of yaks anyway,
didn't we?

46:49.056 --> 46:52.184
What do you want me to do,
send you some flowers?

46:55.688 --> 46:57.981
Where's that girl?
Where's that Kathy?

46:58.149 --> 47:01.693
The bar's closed, counter's closed,
everything is closed.

47:02.570 --> 47:07.032
-Hey, Johnny, can't you stop this?
-Where's that Kathy? I'm looking for her.

47:07.200 --> 47:11.286
-I don't know. If you can stop this--
-I don't stop nothing, man.

47:11.454 --> 47:15.123
-They're wrecking my place.
-You're doing all right, man.

47:15.291 --> 47:17.542
Oh, no. Please.

47:24.717 --> 47:27.135
-You all right?
-Let's get to work on these boys.

47:27.303 --> 47:28.887
-Anybody bring a gun for me?
-Here.

47:29.055 --> 47:32.516
-Wait a minute.
-Wait till somebody gets killed?

47:32.683 --> 47:37.020
I don't go all the way with Charlie either.
But we've got to protect ourselves.

47:37.188 --> 47:39.731
But two wrongs
never made anything right.

47:39.899 --> 47:43.777
-When you start using guns....
-I'm gonna use it, one end or the other.

47:44.195 --> 47:46.029
Anybody who wants to
stay and talk some more...

47:46.197 --> 47:49.574
...can have an ice cream social with Bill.
Anybody don't, can come with me.

47:49.742 --> 47:52.786
If you find him, bring him to the back
of the store. We'll meet there.

47:52.954 --> 47:57.332
We'll do what we can. Let's get hold
of this Johnny before the others do.

48:23.818 --> 48:26.945
Hey, Crazy, man, go, go, go!

48:28.781 --> 48:31.116
That Mildred gives
the craziest permanents.

48:31.284 --> 48:34.744
-Marina, honey, let's dance.
-I've been tapped.

48:58.936 --> 49:00.478
Hey, baby!

49:00.646 --> 49:02.439
Go, go, go!

49:07.320 --> 49:09.988
Come on, Leroy.
Come on, Johnny, go!

49:14.118 --> 49:17.162
Hey, guys, look. New talent.
Hey, fellas.

49:20.041 --> 49:22.876
-Well....
-That's a good one.

49:23.044 --> 49:24.085
Let's get her!

49:51.822 --> 49:55.367
Please don't do this.
Please don't. It's too expensive. Please.

49:55.534 --> 49:58.787
Mildred, honey, where you been?
Let's dance, sweetie.

50:05.461 --> 50:09.005
-Hey! The chick!
-Johnny's girl! Let's get her!

51:51.984 --> 51:53.651
Get on.

54:18.464 --> 54:19.923
Get up.

54:37.483 --> 54:40.401
I'm sorry, I can't fight back.

54:41.320 --> 54:46.574
I'm too tired. It would be better,
wouldn't it? Then you could hit me.

54:48.827 --> 54:51.829
You think you're too good for me.
Nobody is too good for me.

54:51.997 --> 54:54.040
Anybody who thinks
they're too good for me...

54:54.208 --> 54:56.250
...I make sure
I knock them over sometime.

54:56.418 --> 54:58.753
I can slap you around to show you
how good you are...

54:58.921 --> 55:02.090
...and tomorrow I'm someplace else
and I don't even know you or nothing.

55:02.257 --> 55:03.257
Do you want to?

55:03.425 --> 55:08.388
I wouldn't waste my time on a square like
you. What I wanna knock myself out for?

55:08.555 --> 55:11.140
-I'll take you back and dump you. Come.
-Johnny.

55:11.308 --> 55:13.309
Quit that.

55:13.978 --> 55:17.563
It's crazy, isn't it?
You're afraid of me.

55:18.899 --> 55:22.110
I don't know why,
but I'm not afraid of you now.

55:22.653 --> 55:23.945
You're afraid of me.

55:25.322 --> 55:31.202
I'm afraid of you? Are you cracked?
Come on, get on.

55:36.917 --> 55:41.129
I wanted to touch you.
I wanted to try, anyway.

55:43.215 --> 55:44.882
Try what?

55:45.968 --> 55:47.593
I don't know.

55:50.848 --> 55:54.475
I wanted to make it the way
I always thought it would be sometime...

55:54.643 --> 55:56.394
...with somebody.

55:57.479 --> 56:00.189
The way I always thought it might be.

56:04.737 --> 56:08.740
You're still fighting, aren't you?
You're always fighting.

56:10.367 --> 56:12.785
Why do you hate everybody?

56:18.333 --> 56:24.881
I've never ridden on a motorcycle
before. It's fast. It scared me.

56:25.716 --> 56:32.472
But I forgot everything.
It felt good. Is that what you do?

56:35.350 --> 56:39.395
I'm gonna leave.
That's what you want me to do, isn't it?

56:44.026 --> 56:46.402
You know what I used to think about?

56:47.488 --> 56:50.239
I used to think about it a lot
after my mother died.

56:53.327 --> 56:58.790
That somebody would come here
and stop at Uncle Frank's place...

56:58.957 --> 57:02.710
...and buy a cup of coffee or something...

57:03.378 --> 57:06.881
...and he'd like me right away
and he'd take me with him.

57:14.473 --> 57:19.852
Johnny, you were going to give me that
statue. Will you give it to me now?

57:21.605 --> 57:22.897
Why?

57:24.399 --> 57:26.275
I don't know.

57:27.736 --> 57:31.322
I just wondered if you still wanted
to give it to me, that's all.

57:32.282 --> 57:33.574
It's crazy.

57:43.836 --> 57:45.878
Where did you want this guy
to take you?

57:46.046 --> 57:48.422
This guy that had a cup of coffee.

57:49.675 --> 57:53.928
I don't know.
Wherever he was going, I guess.

57:59.309 --> 58:00.935
I'm shaky.

58:04.857 --> 58:06.732
I wish I was going someplace.

58:09.444 --> 58:14.615
I wish you were going someplace.
We could go together.

58:21.915 --> 58:24.125
Johnny, Johnny.

58:24.710 --> 58:25.793
Hey.

58:25.961 --> 58:28.212
Hey. Quit it.

59:11.048 --> 59:13.716
What's the matter, Kathy?
I was only trying to--

59:53.298 --> 59:56.634
-Chino, how did you get out of the can?
-Johnny, I love you.

59:56.802 --> 01:00:01.138
Let's you and me have a beer, and I'll
beat the living Christmas out of you.

01:00:02.516 --> 01:00:04.225
Come on, get everybody together.

01:00:04.393 --> 01:00:07.728
-We're gonna get out of here.
-Storm the Bastille!

01:00:26.164 --> 01:00:28.749
There he comes!
That's him!

01:00:32.921 --> 01:00:35.047
That's him. He's the one who....

01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:33.606
Dad, they've got Johnny.
They're taking him....

01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:37.693
You've just been sitting here?
Aren't you gonna do anything?

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:39.653
There isn't anything to do, Kathy.

01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:43.282
We have to help him. They took him
in a car, Mr. Thomas and some men.

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:44.700
He wasn't doing anything.

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:48.287
He was trying to stop it.
He was going to leave.

01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:52.833
-How are things at Frank's?
-Fight started. I don't know.

01:01:53.001 --> 01:01:54.126
I came to look for you.

01:01:54.294 --> 01:01:58.089
-Uncle Frank is very upset.
-Well, he got what he wanted.

01:01:58.256 --> 01:02:03.719
-Business before pleasure.
-Listen, they've gone crazy. Everybody.

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:07.556
They've got Johnny. You've gotta
help him. They're going to beat him up.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:10.142
I tried to talk to him.

01:02:12.479 --> 01:02:16.482
-Don't you even care?
-What can I do?

01:02:18.527 --> 01:02:20.528
Nothing, I guess.

01:02:22.781 --> 01:02:26.242
But if you don't do something,
you're worse than any of them.

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:31.705
They brought it on themselves. I
saw it coming, but what could I do?

01:02:31.873 --> 01:02:36.544
Charlie Thomas is a bully.
He was a bully in the third grade.

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:40.131
What am I supposed to do,
shoot somebody?

01:02:47.848 --> 01:02:53.727
-Charlie, let me talk to the boy.
-Bill, stay out of this. Get out of our way.

01:02:55.397 --> 01:02:58.482
-My old man used to hit harder than that.
-Shut up.

01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:03.529
Hold on, there.

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:09.410
Get away from that boy. Get back.

01:03:09.578 --> 01:03:12.621
This has got nothing to do with you.
We've got a little job to do.

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:15.749
-This is my job.
-You won't have it long.

01:03:15.917 --> 01:03:18.961
We're doing something that should've
been taken care of before this:

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:22.673
Pounding a little respect for law
and authority into this guy's thick skull.

01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:24.175
That's not the way to do it.

01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:26.969
You got a better way?
You've had a lot of time to try it.

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:32.475
Harry, look, you're too soft-hearted.
This is no time for kindness.

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:35.603
-It's as good a time as any.
-We're doing this our way.

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:39.315
We're gonna make good and sure he
doesn't try anything like this soon again.

01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:43.444
I don't know what he's tried or hasn't
tried. This boy's in my custody.

01:03:43.612 --> 01:03:46.113
If he's done anything to deserve
punishment, he'll get it...

01:03:46.281 --> 01:03:48.032
...but in the right way, not from you.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:52.244
Now, now, Harry. Take it easy.
After all, we're all old friends.

01:03:52.412 --> 01:03:57.249
-Let's be calm and talk it over. Come on.
-Yeah, let's talk this over, Harry.

01:03:58.126 --> 01:03:59.335
Hey!

01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:40.245
There he comes. That's him!

01:06:40.413 --> 01:06:43.582
What's all that? What's all the noise?
What's going on?

01:06:59.683 --> 01:07:02.601
-Get him up.
-We'll really fix him for this.

01:07:02.769 --> 01:07:05.270
-I'm gonna break your neck.
-Finally killed a man, huh?

01:07:05.438 --> 01:07:07.481
Okay, come on. Leave him alone.

01:07:48.523 --> 01:07:50.315
What's the idea?

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:52.484
Let's go.

01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:58.282
Harry, how did all this
get started anyway?

01:07:58.450 --> 01:08:01.702
We had this man, we had this whole
thing stopped when he stuck his nose it.

01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:06.331
-There's a little more to it than that.
-All right. We'll find out what happened.

01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:10.127
Round up everybody on a motorcycle.
Pick up all the witnesses you can find.

01:08:10.295 --> 01:08:12.755
The old man is dead.
A dishwasher down the street.

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:15.174
That makes it a manslaughter charge,
doesn't it?

01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:19.344
We'll see. We'll see. Let's pick up
everything and sort it out inside.

01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:11.563
Twenty years is too good for him.

01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:14.942
I spotted him for the ringleader
the first five minutes.

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:19.363
I knew somebody was gonna get killed.
I couldn't get anybody to listen to me.

01:09:19.531 --> 01:09:22.866
You killed Jimmy with a lot of talk, as
sure as he killed him with a motorcycle.

01:09:23.033 --> 01:09:24.117
Wait a minute.

01:09:24.285 --> 01:09:29.081
All right, okay, okay. That's enough.
Now, stop it. That's all.

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:48.058
Well, son,
you've got yourself something here.

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:50.810
Real important trouble.

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:55.357
It just shows you what a boy can do
if he'll work at it.

01:09:57.402 --> 01:09:59.152
Well?

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:02.531
Haven't you anything to say?

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:10.497
I didn't kill nobody. Those guys were
after me and I just took off. That's all.

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:15.836
Maybe something hit my cycle.
I don't know what happened.

01:10:16.004 --> 01:10:19.673
Then I went out, and that's--
That's all.

01:10:21.134 --> 01:10:23.218
Yeah.

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:25.929
Well....

01:10:31.352 --> 01:10:33.228
Let's go.

01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:41.486
I located my daughter. She went home.
Do you want to talk to her?

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:44.072
-No. Bring her in later.
-You'd better talk to her now.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.449
You do? Well, I don't.

01:10:45.617 --> 01:10:46.950
I've been up half the night.

01:10:47.118 --> 01:10:50.203
I've got a long drive home
before I can get this joker booked.

01:10:50.371 --> 01:10:53.123
-But she was with the boy.
-He knows that. Art Kleiner is--

01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:55.208
Shut up, Frank.

01:10:58.963 --> 01:11:01.423
All right. Come in, sit down.

01:11:02.342 --> 01:11:03.967
That'll be all.

01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:09.765
-Kathy's my niece. I have a right to stay.
-All right, but keep quiet.

01:11:13.937 --> 01:11:16.730
-Well?
-It's crazy.

01:11:16.898 --> 01:11:18.398
Yeah, I know.

01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:22.527
I've got one fact. A man's dead,
and our boy here is stuck with it.

01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:26.323
-I don't think it was his fault.
-Do you know one way or the other?

01:11:27.533 --> 01:11:28.992
No.

01:11:34.165 --> 01:11:36.708
You haven't fallen for this fellow,
have you?

01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:45.884
No. No, I couldn't.

01:11:49.347 --> 01:11:51.223
Let's go.

01:11:59.774 --> 01:12:02.943
They beat him up.
I saw them. He wasn't doing anything.

01:12:03.111 --> 01:12:04.611
I know he was leaving.

01:12:04.779 --> 01:12:08.407
-He just wanted to go when--
-Yes, I know.

01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:11.660
Sheriff, listen.

01:12:11.828 --> 01:12:16.623
-Sheriff, wait, please.
-She's upset. She didn't mean that.

01:12:16.791 --> 01:12:18.959
But regardless
of what happened to old Jimmy...

01:12:19.127 --> 01:12:20.877
...that boy deserves everything
he gets.

01:12:21.045 --> 01:12:26.299
-Art here saw her fighting him off.
-No, Uncle Frank is wrong. He helped me.

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:27.843
They were after me and--

01:12:28.011 --> 01:12:30.595
She was crying,
trying to get away from him.

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:35.058
I wasn't trying to get away from him.
I was just trying to get away.

01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:45.652
Maybe we better tell him, Frank.

01:12:46.487 --> 01:12:47.738
Tell me what?

01:12:47.905 --> 01:12:50.741
-Why, the--
-Art and I were coming up the street.

01:12:50.908 --> 01:12:53.076
Now, we didn't see who threw it...

01:12:53.244 --> 01:12:58.373
...but a tyre iron either hit the boy
or the motorcycle, and it went wild.

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:03.211
-Who threw what?
-A tyre iron. You know, it's a....

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:05.922
The thing to take the tyre off the rim.

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:08.675
Yeah. Somebody threw it
and it landed at our feet.

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.846
Why didn't you say so before?

01:13:25.777 --> 01:13:27.402
Sit down.

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.825
John Strabler.

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:38.914
You got any friends, Johnny?

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.461
You picked up a few around here
last night, strange as it seems.

01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:46.296
A couple anyway.

01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:49.800
They got you off the hook
for a while.

01:13:53.137 --> 01:13:55.055
I don't get you.

01:13:55.348 --> 01:13:59.017
I don't get your act at all.
And I don't think you do, either.

01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:04.439
I don't think you know what you're
trying to do, or how to do it.

01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:10.070
I think you're stupid.
Real stupid and real lucky.

01:14:10.238 --> 01:14:14.241
Last night you scraped by,
just barely.

01:14:14.408 --> 01:14:17.869
But a man's dead on account of
something you let get started...

01:14:18.037 --> 01:14:20.413
...even though you didn't start it.

01:14:26.129 --> 01:14:31.299
I don't know if there is any good in you.
I don't know if there's anything in you...

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:34.094
...but I'm gonna take a big,
fat chance...

01:14:34.887 --> 01:14:36.596
...and let you go.

01:14:38.724 --> 01:14:42.227
There'll be a hearing on this tyre-iron
business. You'll get a summons.

01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:44.354
And you'd better show up.

01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:47.566
Put him on the road.

01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:56.741
-Is that yours?
-Yeah.

01:14:56.909 --> 01:14:58.577
Go ahead.

01:15:00.121 --> 01:15:02.789
Don't you want to say anything
to these people?

01:15:06.544 --> 01:15:09.296
What's the matter?
You been hit over the head so often...

01:15:09.463 --> 01:15:12.632
...you don't know when you're getting
a break? At least say thank you.

01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:19.014
It's all right.
He doesn't know how.

01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:35.280
Okay, hotshots, the fun is over.

01:15:35.448 --> 01:15:39.784
Every one of you monkeys is down in my
book, and all the damage will be paid for.

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:43.371
You've got 10 minutes to clear out.

01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:46.499
Just stick your nose back in this county,
any of you...

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:49.544
...and you'll never see daylight again
as long as you live.

01:15:49.712 --> 01:15:51.379
Now, get.

01:16:40.096 --> 01:16:42.222
Some coffee.
