WEBVTT

00:11.921 --> 00:13.621
This is what you wanted.

00:19.169 --> 00:20.803
Now, please, let me go.

00:23.075 --> 00:24.613
Whoops.

00:30.635 --> 00:32.298
You know, once you clean that up,

00:32.299 --> 00:34.638
maybe we could go for a, um, round...

00:34.639 --> 00:35.905
three?

00:37.408 --> 00:39.376
Whoa.

00:39.377 --> 00:42.745
You do not have to tell me
twice, or should I say thrice?

00:43.748 --> 00:45.883
Good morning, my darlings!

00:45.884 --> 00:48.585
Mother, I really wish you
would call before you came over.

00:48.586 --> 00:50.902
Well, I don't want to risk
interrupting you two love birds

00:50.903 --> 00:53.137
in the middle of you know
what, and it looks like I have

00:53.138 --> 00:55.225
interrupted you in the
middle of you know...

00:55.226 --> 00:57.494
what and with a melon.

00:57.495 --> 01:01.231
My, my. Not judging,
but room temperature.

01:01.232 --> 01:02.132
- Mother.
- I...

01:02.133 --> 01:03.433
What... What is it you want?

01:03.434 --> 01:06.170
I want for my son to grant
me a very simple wish.

01:06.171 --> 01:07.871
Now, it seems that my publisher says

01:07.872 --> 01:10.107
that for my self-help book
to make the best-seller list,

01:10.108 --> 01:12.309
I need a celebrity endorsement

01:12.310 --> 01:14.411
and not just any
celebrity endorsement...

01:14.412 --> 01:16.580
the endorsement of endorsements.

01:16.581 --> 01:19.016
Mother, I would be happy to
write something for your book.

01:19.017 --> 01:20.684
Oprah.

01:20.685 --> 01:21.685
I need Oprah.

01:21.686 --> 01:23.053
Uh, do you even know Oprah?

01:23.054 --> 01:24.354
No, I do not.

01:24.355 --> 01:26.378
Well, you must know someone
who knows Oprah, but...

01:26.379 --> 01:27.925
If I promise to try, will you leave?

01:27.926 --> 01:29.960
Poof. I am gone.

01:29.961 --> 01:31.328
Oh, you know, it's so funny, darling,

01:31.329 --> 01:32.684
'cause I have that same negligee,

01:32.685 --> 01:34.468
but, of course, it's
in a little tiger print,

01:34.469 --> 01:35.599
so it's

01:35.600 --> 01:37.143
Well, resume your lovemaking, darling.

01:37.144 --> 01:39.369
Mwah!

01:40.972 --> 01:42.239
Uh...

01:43.608 --> 01:45.008
Beckett.

01:45.009 --> 01:46.143
Oh!

01:46.144 --> 01:47.578
Hey, Ryan and Espo
have caught a homicide.

01:47.579 --> 01:48.482
You want to join them?

01:48.483 --> 01:49.880
Why? Got a crime scene right here.

01:49.881 --> 01:51.414
My mother just killed the mood.

01:54.118 --> 01:56.687
Uh-huh. Yeah, okay,
baby. I'll call you later.

01:56.688 --> 01:58.422
Reception's terrible in here.

01:58.423 --> 01:59.556
Hey.

02:00.425 --> 02:01.568
Early morning or late night?

02:01.569 --> 02:04.294
Oh! Both.

02:04.295 --> 02:07.130
Jenny can't sleep, which, in her crazy,

02:07.131 --> 02:09.765
nine-month-pregnant logic,
means... out of solidarity...

02:09.767 --> 02:11.401
I'm not allowed to sleep, either.

02:11.402 --> 02:12.636
Oh, well, could be worse.

02:12.637 --> 02:14.304
You could be granted the eternal sleep

02:14.305 --> 02:15.639
like our victim, whose name is?

02:15.640 --> 02:17.040
Lars Cross.

02:17.041 --> 02:20.010
He's a sonar technician for
an oil exploration company.

02:20.011 --> 02:21.311
Yeah, Chesapeake Energy.

02:21.312 --> 02:24.047
Apparently, he was doing an
overseas job for them in Turkey,

02:24.048 --> 02:26.216
but he got fired for
missing too much work.

02:26.217 --> 02:27.351
According to his passport,

02:27.352 --> 02:29.386
he only got back to the
States three days ago.

02:29.387 --> 02:31.521
If he was just fired,
how could he afford

02:31.522 --> 02:33.223
all those wonderful, new toys?

02:33.224 --> 02:34.324
That's nothing.

02:34.325 --> 02:36.393
Got a brand-new Porsche 911 downstairs

02:36.394 --> 02:37.894
that he apparently paid cash for,

02:37.895 --> 02:39.863
and he just leased a safe-deposit box

02:39.864 --> 02:41.064
at a bank down the street.

02:41.065 --> 02:43.600
Well, detectives, I
deduce that our victim's

02:43.601 --> 02:46.036
sudden influx of cash
had something to do

02:46.037 --> 02:48.272
with the fact that... He has no head!

02:48.273 --> 02:51.241
Dudes, seriously, give a guy a heads up.

02:51.242 --> 02:52.609
- Make way, Castle!
- Oh!

02:53.978 --> 02:57.080
Time of death... between
10:00 p.m. and midnight.

02:57.081 --> 02:59.683
Lars was strapped to
that chair with duct tape.

02:59.684 --> 03:01.852
Perimortem bruising
indicates that he was tortured

03:01.853 --> 03:03.654
before the killer
decapitated him with...

03:03.655 --> 03:04.688
Sword!

03:04.689 --> 03:05.689
A Turkish scimitar?!

03:05.690 --> 03:07.758
Ah! I checked... no fingerprints.

03:07.759 --> 03:09.893
It's from the victim's collection.

03:09.894 --> 03:11.962
Apparently, Lars is really
into the Middle East.

03:11.963 --> 03:15.632
Oh, a region known for its
sordid history of beheading.

03:15.633 --> 03:17.100
And yet...

03:17.101 --> 03:20.103
Lars was beheaded here in Manhattan.

03:20.104 --> 03:21.238
Hmm.

03:21.239 --> 03:22.539
Perhaps Lars made the mistake

03:22.540 --> 03:24.441
of telling the king
the ending of the story.

03:24.442 --> 03:25.541
Am I right?

03:26.577 --> 03:28.010
"1001 Arabian Nights."

03:28.813 --> 03:29.980
Truly, I am shocked.

03:29.981 --> 03:31.682
How is it that none
of you know the story

03:31.683 --> 03:32.716
of "1001 Arabian Nights"?

03:32.717 --> 03:34.618
We weren't nerds in high school.

03:34.619 --> 03:37.287
Fair enough. Lucky for you,
class is now in session.

03:37.288 --> 03:39.323
In the story "1001 Arabian Nights,"

03:39.324 --> 03:42.526
a jealous king would sleep with
a new young maiden every night,

03:42.527 --> 03:45.195
then have her beheaded so
no other men could have her.

03:45.196 --> 03:48.165
So, it's a story about a
misogynistic serial killer?

03:48.166 --> 03:50.067
No. Well, yes, but no.

03:50.068 --> 03:51.902
In the story, to stop the bloodshed,

03:51.903 --> 03:53.970
a young maiden by the
name of Scheherazade

03:53.971 --> 03:56.506
wove a fascinating tale for the king,

03:56.507 --> 03:58.108
but she refused to tell him the ending,

03:58.109 --> 04:00.052
forcing him to keep her
alive till the next night

04:00.053 --> 04:01.645
so she could finish the story.

04:01.646 --> 04:05.215
She told him a new story
every night for 1001 nights

04:05.216 --> 04:07.551
till finally, the king married her,

04:07.552 --> 04:10.954
which really says a lot about
the power of a good storyteller.

04:10.955 --> 04:13.724
Yet tells us nothing about
why our victim was killed.

04:13.725 --> 04:14.524
Or does it?

04:14.525 --> 04:15.759
Our victim was tortured

04:15.760 --> 04:19.029
because like the killer, like
the king, wanted something.

04:19.029 --> 04:22.232
Well, our victim's sister is
meeting me in the precinct.

04:22.233 --> 04:24.401
Maybe she can shed some
light on what that thing was.

04:24.402 --> 04:27.037
I'll pull a warrant for
Lars' new safe-deposit box,

04:27.038 --> 04:29.158
see if there's a clue as to
what our killer was after.

04:29.182 --> 04:29.903
Oh.

04:29.904 --> 04:31.041
This is Oprah's assistant.

04:31.042 --> 04:32.242
Um, I'll take this.

04:32.243 --> 04:33.477
Uh, you guys...

04:33.478 --> 04:35.312
head out without me.

04:37.115 --> 04:38.715
I'll...

04:38.716 --> 04:40.884
be heading to the precinct
in just a little while.

04:40.885 --> 04:42.085
Guys, these are comedy gold.

04:42.086 --> 04:43.687
Seriously. Hello?

04:43.688 --> 04:44.721
- Not funny.
- You're breaking up. I can't hear you.

04:44.722 --> 04:45.825
- I know.
- Just one second.

04:45.826 --> 04:46.923
Are you getting reception?

04:46.924 --> 04:48.258
Thank you. Hello?

04:48.259 --> 04:50.460
Yes.

04:50.461 --> 04:52.529
Well, actually, it's not
about one of my books.

04:52.530 --> 04:53.930
It's about my mother's.

04:53.931 --> 04:55.899
No, I-I only wish I was joking.

04:55.900 --> 04:57.401
- Are you a cop?
- Geez!

04:57.402 --> 04:58.602
I don't recognize you,

04:58.603 --> 05:00.266
and I've lived in this
building for years.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.372
I'm actually with the cops.

05:02.373 --> 05:03.774
I can send you the manuscript?

05:03.775 --> 05:04.975
I know who the killer is.

05:04.976 --> 05:07.444
Can you... Uh, Can you
h-hold... hold one moment?

05:07.445 --> 05:09.079
It was Lars' ex-boyfriend, Mark.

05:09.080 --> 05:11.882
Last night around 9:00, Mark
was banging on Lars' door,

05:11.883 --> 05:15.285
said Lars owed him money and
that he better pay up or else.

05:15.286 --> 05:16.787
H-H-Hang on.

05:16.788 --> 05:19.222
Uh, c-can I call you right...

05:19.223 --> 05:21.358
Hello?

05:21.359 --> 05:23.593
Hello?

05:23.594 --> 05:24.661
Shoot.

05:24.662 --> 05:25.996
All right, where were...

05:25.997 --> 05:28.131
we?

05:28.132 --> 05:29.598
Where'd she go?

05:31.093 --> 05:33.036
Ms. Cross, your brother
appears to have come into

05:33.037 --> 05:35.140
a great deal of money upon
his return to the country,

05:35.141 --> 05:36.773
but we checked his financials,

05:36.774 --> 05:38.809
and there's no record
where it came from.

05:38.810 --> 05:40.143
Do you have any idea?

05:40.144 --> 05:41.611
None.

05:41.612 --> 05:44.214
I know for a fact he was
broke when he left for Turkey.

05:44.215 --> 05:46.283
Did he have any enemies
at home or abroad?

05:46.284 --> 05:47.217
No.

05:47.218 --> 05:48.652
He got along with everyone.

05:48.653 --> 05:50.387
Ever his ex-boyfriend, Mark?

05:50.388 --> 05:52.422
According to Castle,
a neighbor overheard

05:52.423 --> 05:56.359
Lars' ex yelling outside
of his apartment last night.

05:56.360 --> 05:58.295
Did your brother owe him money?

05:58.296 --> 06:01.865
Mark helped pay for
Lars' tuition at Columbia.

06:01.866 --> 06:03.533
Lars never paid him back, did he?

06:03.534 --> 06:05.635
No. They broke up.

06:05.636 --> 06:07.838
In fact, getting away from
Mark was the main reason

06:07.839 --> 06:09.306
he took that job in Turkey.

06:10.308 --> 06:12.709
So, Mark, you used to date Lars.

06:12.710 --> 06:15.278
Well, according to these reports,

06:15.279 --> 06:16.913
he called the cops on you

06:16.914 --> 06:19.316
over a dozen times in the past year.

06:19.317 --> 06:21.585
I sometimes get overly dramatic.

06:21.586 --> 06:22.953
- Ah.
- What can I do?

06:22.954 --> 06:26.857
I am a Pisces, but I am
over Lars, and I moved on.

06:26.858 --> 06:28.825
Not according to a witness

06:28.826 --> 06:31.127
who saw you threatening him last night.

06:31.128 --> 06:32.596
Oh. Yes.

06:32.597 --> 06:34.731
I threatened him... a lot.

06:34.732 --> 06:37.701
All right, I gave him 20
grand to get his degree,

06:37.702 --> 06:38.935
and what thanks do I get?

06:38.936 --> 06:42.038
He dumps me and leaves the country.

06:42.039 --> 06:43.773
And now he's back two months later,

06:43.774 --> 06:46.510
rolling around in a Porsche, so, yeah.

06:46.511 --> 06:47.878
I went a little mental.

06:47.879 --> 06:50.113
Sure, if by going "a little mental,"

06:50.114 --> 06:53.517
you mean torturing and killing your ex.

06:53.518 --> 06:55.452
What?

06:55.453 --> 06:57.487
Lars is... is dead?!

06:57.488 --> 06:59.121
Oh, my...

07:05.396 --> 07:06.929
Y-You think I did it?

07:08.232 --> 07:09.699
Oh, G...

07:09.700 --> 07:11.167
Lars was the love of my life.

07:11.168 --> 07:13.802
I-I could never just...

07:15.306 --> 07:19.009
Look, Lars was alive when I left him.

07:19.010 --> 07:20.043
I swear to you.

07:20.044 --> 07:20.877
What time was that?

07:20.878 --> 07:22.078
9:30?

07:22.079 --> 07:23.113
I Ubered up town.

07:23.114 --> 07:24.748
I-I met some friends at a bar

07:24.749 --> 07:27.282
and drank away my sorrows till 2:00 a.m.

07:28.252 --> 07:29.819
All right, let's just, uh, suppose

07:29.820 --> 07:31.321
that you are telling the truth.

07:31.322 --> 07:32.689
What happened at Lars'?

07:32.690 --> 07:35.959
He let me in, apologized for everything,

07:35.960 --> 07:40.030
and said he just needed a day
to get the cash to pay me b...

07:40.031 --> 07:42.265
Wait. He was telling the truth?

07:42.266 --> 07:43.433
The truth about what?

07:43.434 --> 07:46.236
He was acting all paranoid.

07:46.237 --> 07:48.204
He had smuggled something
back from Turkey,

07:48.205 --> 07:50.440
and his partner thought
he had double-crossed him.

07:50.441 --> 07:52.008
Whoa, whoa. Hold on. What partner?

07:52.009 --> 07:53.310
I don't know. I don't know.

07:53.311 --> 07:55.312
Honestly, I just thought
he was making it all up

07:55.313 --> 07:57.180
so Th-that he wouldn't have to pay me.

07:57.181 --> 07:58.648
I bet that pissed you off, huh?

07:58.649 --> 07:59.950
Well, no.

07:59.951 --> 08:02.986
I... Well, yeah, i-it
did, but I didn't kill him!

08:02.987 --> 08:05.821
All right, I just took
his laptop as collateral.

08:08.459 --> 08:09.893
Is that why he was killed?

08:09.894 --> 08:11.962
We're gonna need that laptop.

08:11.963 --> 08:14.331
Mark's alibi checks out here.
He was telling the truth.

08:14.332 --> 08:15.999
So, what do you think
Lars was smuggling?

08:16.000 --> 08:17.334
Well, he was in Turkey,

08:17.335 --> 08:19.903
which is the heroin
pipeline from Afghanistan.

08:19.904 --> 08:22.806
- Hmm. No. Wasn't drugs.
- Why not?

08:22.807 --> 08:25.308
Because Lars was beheaded by a scimitar.

08:25.309 --> 08:27.344
Well, the storyteller inside me

08:27.345 --> 08:29.512
craves an explanation for more...

08:29.513 --> 08:30.847
- Farfetched?
- Yeah.

08:30.848 --> 08:32.816
Pirate's booty? Cold fusion?

08:32.817 --> 08:34.417
- Alien cadavers?
- No.

08:34.418 --> 08:35.751
Those are all ridiculous theories.

08:35.753 --> 08:37.267
Did you say "alien cadavers," though?

08:37.268 --> 08:38.691
Because I saw a documentary once...

08:38.692 --> 08:40.289
Hey, Castle, um, what was the name

08:40.291 --> 08:42.859
of that woman that you
interviewed... Lars' neighbor?

08:42.860 --> 08:44.159
I didn't get her name.

08:44.159 --> 08:46.424
I think my UNIs forgot to put
her statement in this file.

08:46.425 --> 08:47.564
I swear, most of my time

08:47.565 --> 08:49.366
is spent checking people's paperwork.

08:49.367 --> 08:51.601
You're suffering from a
little buyer's remorse.

08:51.602 --> 08:53.269
Yeah, it's one of life's cruel jokes.

08:53.270 --> 08:54.904
You get exactly what you wished for,

08:54.905 --> 08:57.674
only to find that it wasn't
what you wanted at all.

08:57.675 --> 08:59.576
No, I love being a captain.

08:59.577 --> 09:01.144
It's just, sometimes it feels like

09:01.145 --> 09:02.746
I'm more of a kindergarten teacher.

09:02.747 --> 09:04.650
- I'm a sergeant.
- Get out of my way.

09:04.651 --> 09:06.483
I just broke this case wide open.

09:06.484 --> 09:08.084
Actually, I did, so I'll go first.

09:08.085 --> 09:09.886
No, I think I'll go first.

09:09.887 --> 09:10.921
Mine's bigger than yours.

09:10.922 --> 09:11.945
You wish, pal.

09:11.946 --> 09:12.822
Guys...

09:12.823 --> 09:14.124
play nice... indoor voices.

09:14.125 --> 09:15.058
Espo goes first.

09:15.059 --> 09:16.159
See, she knows.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.128
So, I opened Lars' safe-deposit box

09:18.129 --> 09:19.562
and found 400 G's in cash.

09:19.563 --> 09:21.097
Gots to be drug money. Beat that.

09:21.098 --> 09:24.000
Easy... got Lars'
encrypted laptop from Mark,

09:24.001 --> 09:25.535
found out what he was smuggling,

09:25.536 --> 09:28.471
and it wasn't drugs.

09:28.472 --> 09:29.638
What?

09:32.843 --> 09:37.514
No. Lars wasn't a drug dealer.

09:37.515 --> 09:40.617
He was a tomb raider.

09:40.618 --> 09:44.586
R-Ryan, can you zoom
in on that, please?

09:45.222 --> 09:46.421
I've seen that symbol.

09:47.925 --> 09:50.260
Yes, uh at Lars' apartment.

09:50.261 --> 09:53.029
You remember there was all those
books on "1001 Arabian Nights."

09:53.030 --> 09:54.464
I think that symbol...

09:54.465 --> 09:56.733
...was on one of the books.

09:56.734 --> 09:59.234
Yes. Here it is.

10:01.939 --> 10:04.307
The Seal of Solomon.

10:04.308 --> 10:06.131
"The Seal of Solomon
was believed to be imbued

10:06.132 --> 10:07.377
with mystical powers,

10:07.378 --> 10:10.613
including the ability to
seal genies into lamps.

10:10.614 --> 10:12.582
In the tale of 'Aladdin
and the Magic Lamp, '

10:12.583 --> 10:15.018
Aladdin finds a lamp
containing a genie in a cave.

10:15.019 --> 10:16.419
Many people believe this cave

10:16.420 --> 10:18.154
was actually King Solomon's tomb,

10:18.155 --> 10:19.522
which is most likely located

10:19.523 --> 10:21.557
near the border of Syria and Turkey."

10:22.860 --> 10:24.760
You guys, you know what this means?

10:26.163 --> 10:27.497
Oh, please, no.

10:27.498 --> 10:30.600
Come on. The money, the Porsche.

10:30.601 --> 10:34.003
Lars wished for them, and
his wishes were granted...

10:34.004 --> 10:34.904
And here we go.

10:34.905 --> 10:36.371
...by a genie!

10:38.242 --> 10:40.243
Lars found Aladdin's lamp!

10:48.493 --> 10:54.168
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com</b>.

10:55.108 --> 10:56.574
Perfect! Thank you, Diane.

10:58.329 --> 10:59.763
- Guys?
- Yeah?

10:59.764 --> 11:01.064
Look at this.

11:01.065 --> 11:04.768
These books from Lars' apartment
on "1001 Arabian Nights,"

11:04.769 --> 11:07.070
they all have handwritten notes in them.

11:07.071 --> 11:09.773
This one has... maps drawn in it.

11:09.774 --> 11:12.876
This one has his theories of
where King Solomon is buried.

11:12.877 --> 11:14.761
These books were his
research that he used

11:14.762 --> 11:16.996
in conjunction with his
skills as a sonar engineer

11:16.997 --> 11:19.032
to unearth King Solomon's tomb...

11:19.033 --> 11:20.333
Yeah, we're with you on that.

11:20.334 --> 11:22.101
...and find the magical
lamp with the genie in it.

11:22.102 --> 11:23.445
That's where you lose us, Castle.

11:23.446 --> 11:25.305
The only thing magical about that lamp

11:25.306 --> 11:27.300
is the millions of dollars
that private collectors

11:27.301 --> 11:28.364
are willing to pay for it.

11:28.365 --> 11:29.309
Come on, Castle.

11:29.310 --> 11:31.013
you don't really believe
in genies, do you?

11:31.014 --> 11:33.479
I believe that until I
hear a more viable theory

11:33.480 --> 11:35.014
as to where Lars got all that money

11:35.015 --> 11:37.083
that this is the best theory I've got.

11:37.084 --> 11:39.285
So, a genie is your best explanation?

11:39.286 --> 11:41.454
Not that Lars sold one
of the items in Turkey

11:41.455 --> 11:43.289
before smuggling the rest back here?

11:43.290 --> 11:45.525
Okay, it's a... pretty good theory.

11:45.526 --> 11:46.859
Or that Lars
double-crossed his partner,

11:46.860 --> 11:48.428
and that's probably where
all the cash came from.

11:48.429 --> 11:49.996
Fine. That's a good theory, too.

11:49.997 --> 11:52.198
No, no, no. That's...
That's better than good.

11:52.199 --> 11:54.334
It explains why the killer tortured him.

11:54.335 --> 11:56.569
If it was his partner,
then he would've wanted

11:56.570 --> 11:58.738
to find out what happened
to the antiquities.

11:58.739 --> 12:00.974
We'll look into Lars' time in Turkey,

12:00.975 --> 12:03.109
see if we can dig up a
connection to his partner.

12:03.110 --> 12:04.243
Okay.

12:04.244 --> 12:06.879
My money... it's whoever
took those pictures.

12:06.880 --> 12:08.247
Yeah.

12:08.248 --> 12:09.649
What do you got there?

12:09.650 --> 12:11.651
The woman who wrote this
book, Dr. Marion Baker,

12:11.652 --> 12:13.486
she's a professor of
Middle Eastern literature

12:13.487 --> 12:15.221
at Hudson University.

12:15.222 --> 12:16.556
We should go talk to her.

12:16.557 --> 12:17.757
Knowing more about the lamp

12:17.758 --> 12:19.792
will help us figure out
why Lars was killed for it.

12:19.793 --> 12:21.976
You just want to find out
more about genies and wishes.

12:21.977 --> 12:22.762
Well, yeah.

12:22.763 --> 12:24.297
Fine, go ahead. Meet with Dr. Baker.

12:24.298 --> 12:26.132
Maybe she can talk some sense into you.

12:26.133 --> 12:28.334
Your wish is my command.

12:28.335 --> 12:29.969
Smoke!

12:29.970 --> 12:32.405
And he's gone.

12:32.406 --> 12:33.406
Okay, now I'm gone.

12:33.407 --> 12:36.074
Oh... my...

12:40.047 --> 12:42.615
King Solomon's tomb. Remarkable.

12:42.616 --> 12:46.219
It's arguably the greatest
discovery in the last 50 years.

12:46.220 --> 12:50.256
Now, this, Dr. Baker, is what
I need your expertise with.

12:50.257 --> 12:51.389
Certainly.

12:52.459 --> 12:54.327
Oh, you see these grooves.

12:54.328 --> 12:57.397
They indicate it was a wheel-made lamp

12:57.398 --> 12:59.941
versus the mold-based ones that
became so popular in the '40s...

12:59.942 --> 13:02.602
Uh, fascinating, Doctor,
but can you skip ahead

13:02.603 --> 13:06.339
to the part where King Solomon
seals a genie inside of it?

13:06.340 --> 13:07.974
Ah.

13:07.975 --> 13:09.409
Did Sidney put you up to this?

13:09.410 --> 13:10.376
Who's Sidney?

13:10.377 --> 13:12.111
The schmuck I beat out for tenure.

13:12.112 --> 13:13.746
Dr. Baker, I do not know Sidney.

13:13.747 --> 13:15.648
This is not a joke. I am very serious.

13:15.649 --> 13:17.850
But you're acting as if
you believe in genies.

13:17.851 --> 13:20.319
Doctor, it's not an act.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.288
Well, the story of
"Aladdin and the Magic Lamp"

13:22.289 --> 13:24.457
is a romantic metaphor, nothing more.

13:24.458 --> 13:27.493
Of course, but what if...
and I... and I'm only saying

13:27.494 --> 13:32.065
what if the legend of
genies were based in fact?

13:32.066 --> 13:35.535
Well, I certainly hope it isn't.
Genies are frightful creatures.

13:35.536 --> 13:37.804
You're saying they're
not cheery '60s housewives

13:37.805 --> 13:39.305
or singing blue cartoons?

13:39.306 --> 13:40.706
I'll put it to you like this.

13:40.707 --> 13:42.708
In Arabic, they use the
same word for "demon"

13:42.709 --> 13:43.776
as they do for "genie."

13:43.777 --> 13:46.279
They're dangerous, capricious tricksters

13:46.280 --> 13:48.915
who appear and disappear
in gentle breezes

13:48.916 --> 13:50.516
or a whirlwind of dust.

13:50.517 --> 13:52.652
Now, what if the master
of the lamp is killed

13:52.653 --> 13:54.187
before the wishes are granted?

13:54.188 --> 13:56.055
Well, then the masterless genie

13:56.056 --> 13:58.458
would be separated from its lamp.

13:58.459 --> 14:00.827
Like a Japanese ronin samurai?

14:00.828 --> 14:03.663
Exactly, but the genie would be forced

14:03.664 --> 14:06.299
to wander the earth until
a new master rubs the lamp.

14:06.300 --> 14:07.700
Tell me more, Dr. Baker.

14:07.701 --> 14:10.837
Oh, sure... for the
low, low price of $19.95.

14:10.838 --> 14:11.803
Buy my book.

14:12.840 --> 14:15.575
You don't give your stories
away for free, Mr. Castle,

14:15.576 --> 14:17.143
and neither do I.

14:17.144 --> 14:21.314
So, if, uh, you'll excuse
me, I have a class to teach.

14:21.315 --> 14:23.082
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

14:27.855 --> 14:29.155
Dad, what are you thinking?

14:29.156 --> 14:31.924
Lars found the lamp,

14:31.925 --> 14:33.726
and, clearly, he rubbed it,

14:33.727 --> 14:36.028
but that makes him the
genie's master, right?

14:36.029 --> 14:38.264
But if no one has rubbed the lamp since

14:38.265 --> 14:41.300
and I were to discover it...

14:41.301 --> 14:43.469
then that would make me
the genie's new master.

14:43.470 --> 14:45.004
Okay.

14:45.005 --> 14:46.973
Let's just pretend
that all this is real.

14:46.974 --> 14:49.809
You do realize that if
Lars was the genie's master,

14:49.810 --> 14:52.111
it didn't work out so
well for him in the end.

14:52.112 --> 14:53.546
What are you saying?

14:53.547 --> 14:55.414
Be careful what you wish for.

14:55.415 --> 14:56.616
It just might come true.

14:56.617 --> 14:59.384
And in this case, it
might just get you killed.

15:00.387 --> 15:02.455
I could really use a genie right now.

15:02.456 --> 15:05.391
I would wish that my
kid was already born

15:05.392 --> 15:07.226
and sleeping through the night.

15:07.227 --> 15:10.930
Bro, fatherhood has
made you so damn boring.

15:10.931 --> 15:12.231
If I had a wish,

15:12.232 --> 15:15.134
I'd use it to become the
top MMA fighter in the world

15:15.135 --> 15:17.937
and take home a different
hot chick every single night.

15:17.938 --> 15:19.939
Okay, now that I think about it...

15:19.940 --> 15:21.541
I would wish...

15:21.542 --> 15:24.043
that I could be a Broadway star.

15:24.044 --> 15:27.647
Play Jean Valjean in
front of sold-out crowds,

15:27.648 --> 15:29.282
win a bunch of Tonys.

15:29.283 --> 15:30.383
You'd wish to wear tights

15:30.384 --> 15:31.817
and sing show tunes for a living?

15:31.818 --> 15:32.852
You'd wish to wear Speedos

15:32.853 --> 15:34.287
and grapple sweaty men for a living?

15:34.288 --> 15:35.821
And hook up with a different
hot chick every night.

15:35.822 --> 15:37.690
- Don't forget that part.
- You know what I wish?

15:37.691 --> 15:40.314
That my detectives would actually
get some work done for a living.

15:40.315 --> 15:42.153
While the two of you
were on Fantasy Island,

15:42.154 --> 15:44.197
I found a lead.

15:44.198 --> 15:45.364
Mike Harlin.

15:45.365 --> 15:47.200
He's a surface driller
for Chesapeake Energy.

15:47.201 --> 15:49.268
That is the same company
that Lars worked for.

15:49.269 --> 15:53.439
He was also on the same plane
as Lars from Turkey to New York.

15:53.440 --> 15:54.740
He's got to be Lars' partner.

15:54.741 --> 15:56.943
I pinged his cellphone.
It's disconnected.

15:56.944 --> 15:58.311
He's making a run for it.

15:58.312 --> 15:59.912
And if he tortured the
location of the antiquities

15:59.913 --> 16:00.713
out of Lars...

16:00.714 --> 16:02.014
Then there's a good chance

16:02.015 --> 16:04.315
that he's gonna grab them
and try to disappear for good.

16:05.352 --> 16:07.319
Alexis?

16:11.058 --> 16:11.924
You.

16:11.925 --> 16:13.092
Hey.

16:13.093 --> 16:14.594
You broke into my office?

16:14.595 --> 16:15.995
No, the redhead let me in.

16:15.996 --> 16:17.463
Said I could wait inside.

16:17.464 --> 16:19.732
You went through my desk.

16:19.733 --> 16:22.068
To look for a pen to write you a note.

16:22.069 --> 16:24.270
Wow, you are a very distrusting person.

16:24.271 --> 16:26.405
Yes, I get that way when I'm lied to.

16:26.406 --> 16:27.940
Now, I don't know who you are,

16:27.941 --> 16:30.644
but you sure as hell are not Lars'
neighbor. I'm calling the police.

16:30.645 --> 16:32.245
If you do, I'm out that door.

16:32.246 --> 16:35.081
And you'll never know how
powerful of an ally I can be.

16:35.082 --> 16:37.850
All right, you got one
minute to convince me. Go.

16:37.851 --> 16:39.852
My name is Lindsay Dillon.

16:39.853 --> 16:41.821
I'm a journalist researching a story

16:41.822 --> 16:43.289
about looted antiquities.

16:43.290 --> 16:44.557
A source in Turkey hinted

16:44.558 --> 16:46.993
that Lars may have discovered
King Solomon's tomb,

16:46.994 --> 16:48.728
so I decided to keep tabs on him.

16:48.729 --> 16:50.329
That's when I overheard the fight he had

16:50.330 --> 16:51.247
with his ex-boyfriend.

16:51.248 --> 16:53.165
So, why not tell the police? Why lie?

16:53.166 --> 16:55.034
Because when you've got a dead body,

16:55.035 --> 16:57.803
a story about stolen relics
turns from a back-page snoozer

16:57.804 --> 16:59.972
to a front-page lead just like that.

16:59.973 --> 17:01.574
And though I wanted to be helpful

17:01.575 --> 17:02.838
to your murder investigation...

17:02.839 --> 17:04.277
If you made an official statement,

17:04.278 --> 17:06.078
every reporter would
hear about your story,

17:06.079 --> 17:07.579
and you'd lose your exclusive.

17:07.580 --> 17:09.482
See? I knew you'd get it.

17:09.483 --> 17:11.950
That doesn't explain why you
broke into my office un...

17:13.353 --> 17:14.686
Unless you have another lead.

17:14.688 --> 17:16.622
We're both writers.

17:16.623 --> 17:17.957
Let's help each other out.

17:17.958 --> 17:21.227
Only you've got to keep me
as your anonymous source.

17:21.228 --> 17:22.161
- Deal?
- Deal.

17:22.162 --> 17:23.261
What do you got?

17:24.830 --> 17:26.665
Lars was working with
a guy named Mike Harlin.

17:26.666 --> 17:28.801
Yeah, we know about him
already, but he's missing,

17:28.802 --> 17:31.103
unless you know where he's been hiding?

17:31.104 --> 17:40.813
No. But I do know that Harlin
used an alias while in Turkey.

17:40.814 --> 17:42.715
Al Aiden.

17:42.716 --> 17:44.483
This is great.

17:44.484 --> 17:46.418
I'm gonna call this in.

17:47.854 --> 17:48.988
Al Aiden.

17:48.989 --> 17:49.855
Aladdin!

17:49.856 --> 17:51.223
Yeah, that's cute.

17:51.224 --> 17:52.091
Beckett.

17:52.092 --> 17:54.060
Hey, I have a lead for you.

17:54.061 --> 17:56.362
It's the... Uh...

17:56.363 --> 17:57.963
hang on a second.

17:57.964 --> 17:59.332
Stop that woman.

17:59.333 --> 18:00.499
What woman?

18:00.500 --> 18:02.501
T-The blonde woman.
The woman who just...

18:07.741 --> 18:10.576
How did she get past you?

18:10.577 --> 18:13.746
Yeah, Cap, front desk
confirmed an Al Aiden

18:13.747 --> 18:15.581
checked into room 57 this morning.

18:15.582 --> 18:18.217
We're on our way to the room now.

18:19.019 --> 18:20.351
- Mike Harlin?
- Oh!

18:23.123 --> 18:24.323
NYPD!

18:24.324 --> 18:26.359
Hey, away from the window now!

18:26.360 --> 18:28.103
- Okay! Okay!
- Get on your knees right now!

18:28.104 --> 18:29.195
Okay! Okay. Chill, man.

18:29.196 --> 18:30.896
Interlace your fingers behind your head.

18:30.897 --> 18:32.231
All right.

18:34.067 --> 18:35.334
I knew she'd lead you to me.

18:35.335 --> 18:36.736
Who? What are you talking about?

18:36.737 --> 18:39.138
The genie, man!

18:39.139 --> 18:40.972
She's out to get me.

18:43.897 --> 18:45.196
Genie are evil.

18:46.116 --> 18:48.684
And their wishes bring
about nothing but misery.

18:49.219 --> 18:52.989
Uh-huh. I see what's happening here.

18:52.990 --> 18:57.374
The, uh, wandering ronin
genie is angry with Harlin

18:57.375 --> 18:58.676
for killing her master.

18:58.677 --> 19:00.700
That's why she prevented
him from finding the lamp.

19:00.701 --> 19:02.646
Yeah, Castle, the man
is either delusional

19:02.647 --> 19:06.850
or he's laying the groundwork
for some B.S. insanity plea.

19:06.851 --> 19:08.084
What's your excuse?

19:09.020 --> 19:10.220
Let's talk about Lars

19:10.221 --> 19:11.522
and how you chopped his
head off with a sword.

19:11.523 --> 19:13.290
No, no, no, no, no. I didn't kill him.

19:13.291 --> 19:15.793
Okay, I was at my mom's birthday
party when he got murdered.

19:15.794 --> 19:17.194
Man, check it out!

19:17.195 --> 19:19.963
I'm sure whoever took Lars'
head off is coming for mine next.

19:19.964 --> 19:21.065
Really? Why is that?

19:21.066 --> 19:23.267
I know too much.

19:23.268 --> 19:25.703
Me and Lars, we met
on the job in Turkey.

19:25.704 --> 19:26.704
Okay?

19:26.705 --> 19:28.172
And then one day...

19:28.173 --> 19:30.574
after a sonar search for
oil pockets, Lars came to me.

19:30.575 --> 19:31.909
He was all excited.

19:31.910 --> 19:34.511
Because he found the location
of King Solomon's tomb,

19:34.512 --> 19:37.015
and you use your skills as an
excavator to help him dig it out.

19:37.016 --> 19:38.315
No, no, it wasn't that easy.

19:38.316 --> 19:40.384
We needed money to do it safely, okay?

19:40.385 --> 19:41.885
So Lars, he found some guy.

19:41.886 --> 19:45.655
He offered us 250Ks each
in cash to do the dig.

19:46.322 --> 19:47.825
The catch was, if we found something,

19:47.826 --> 19:50.561
well, Lars had to ship it to
the guy who's here in New York.

19:50.562 --> 19:52.029
Okay, so, who is this financier?

19:52.030 --> 19:53.330
I don't know.

19:53.331 --> 19:55.899
Look, the money was too good,
so I didn't ask any questions.

19:55.900 --> 19:58.502
I-I-I wish I did, though,
'cause opening that tomb

19:58.503 --> 20:00.671
was the worst thing
that had happened to us.

20:00.672 --> 20:03.674
I mean the moment we took that lamp,

20:03.675 --> 20:06.276
that genie unleashed its vengeance, man.

20:06.277 --> 20:08.700
You can't honestly be trying
to tell us that you saw a genie.

20:08.701 --> 20:12.015
No, but genies can choose to appear
or not to appear to anyone they want.

20:12.016 --> 20:13.016
That's true.

20:13.017 --> 20:14.200
Professor Baker told me that,

20:14.201 --> 20:15.986
and she's a doctor, so...

20:15.987 --> 20:20.124
Look, guys, I didn't believe
in genies, either, okay?

20:20.125 --> 20:21.591
Until my life fell apart.

20:22.427 --> 20:24.261
I found my girlfriend
in bed with my roommate,

20:24.262 --> 20:25.562
and then I stayed with my mom,

20:25.563 --> 20:29.199
and my mom accidentally
threw out the duffel bag

20:29.200 --> 20:30.567
with my 250 G's!

20:30.568 --> 20:32.202
You know, and when I think that things,

20:32.203 --> 20:33.637
they... they can't get any worse,

20:33.638 --> 20:36.240
I found out that Lars
got his head lopped off,

20:36.241 --> 20:38.104
and now that genie...
that crazy, evil genie...

20:38.105 --> 20:39.276
is after me, man! I know it!

20:39.277 --> 20:41.678
Okay, Harlin, I'm gonna have
to get you off the crazy train

20:41.679 --> 20:42.982
that you're riding on right now.

20:42.983 --> 20:45.482
Yeah, we know that the
shipment got screwed up

20:45.483 --> 20:48.118
and... and you suspected
that Lars double-crossed you.

20:48.119 --> 20:49.520
What? No.

20:49.521 --> 20:50.875
No, Lars did not double-cross me.

20:50.876 --> 20:52.379
He got double-crossed by the shipper.

20:52.380 --> 20:54.491
Okay, well, really, the smuggler.

20:54.492 --> 20:56.647
You can't just walk past
customs with priceless relics

20:56.648 --> 20:58.071
and expect no one to notice, right?

20:58.072 --> 21:01.398
So, Lars hired a guy back in
Turkey to ship the items back?

21:01.399 --> 21:03.133
What was his name? I don't know.

21:03.134 --> 21:04.268
I do know. Hold on.

21:04.269 --> 21:05.636
I do... I do know

21:05.637 --> 21:07.871
that he lied to the shipper, okay?

21:07.872 --> 21:10.340
He told him it was
just mining equipment.

21:10.341 --> 21:11.964
The only thing was
that one from his crew

21:11.965 --> 21:13.844
jimmied the crate and,
uh, found the artifacts.

21:13.845 --> 21:15.988
Let me guess. The shipper
started seeing dollar signs?

21:15.989 --> 21:18.348
Yeah, and then he demanded
400 grand... in cash...

21:18.349 --> 21:19.850
just to release the shipment.

21:19.851 --> 21:22.886
That explains the cash that we
found in Lars' safe-deposit box.

21:22.887 --> 21:25.055
Right, but how the hell
did Lars get his hands on

21:25.056 --> 21:26.356
400,000 bucks?

21:26.357 --> 21:28.859
Uh, don't... don't say
that he wished for it.

21:28.860 --> 21:31.295
He probably got the
money from the financier.

21:31.296 --> 21:33.530
But... But the one thing
that doesn't make sense is,

21:33.531 --> 21:35.399
if Lars already had the extortion money,

21:35.400 --> 21:36.967
then why did the shipper kill him?

21:36.968 --> 21:38.168
Uh, don't...

21:38.169 --> 21:40.337
Do not say that it was to
gain control of the genie.

21:40.338 --> 21:41.470
I wasn't gonna.

21:42.106 --> 21:43.340
Okay, I was.

21:43.341 --> 21:47.044
But there is another possibility.

21:47.045 --> 21:49.413
Maybe the shipper kept
the treasure for himself.

21:49.414 --> 21:51.582
Well, then why torture Lars?

21:51.583 --> 21:53.884
I mean, what information
could he possibly want

21:53.885 --> 21:55.851
if he already had the artifacts?

21:56.588 --> 21:59.089
Hey, guys, any leads
on who the financier is?

21:59.090 --> 22:01.225
No. Whoever paid for Lars'
and Harlin's tomb raiding

22:01.226 --> 22:02.659
made sure to cover their tracks.

22:02.660 --> 22:04.895
Well, Harlin's alibi checked out.

22:04.896 --> 22:06.864
Which means that this mystery shipper

22:06.865 --> 22:07.965
is our prime suspect.

22:07.966 --> 22:09.066
If he was extorting Lars,

22:09.067 --> 22:10.667
he'd have plenty of motive for murder.

22:10.668 --> 22:11.835
Okay, check in with customs.

22:11.836 --> 22:13.370
Let's get a list of all of the ships

22:13.371 --> 22:15.372
that have come in from
Turkey in the last week.

22:15.373 --> 22:17.007
If we can track down those antiquities,

22:17.008 --> 22:18.841
that should lead us to the killer.

22:23.414 --> 22:24.982
Hey, are you okay?

22:24.983 --> 22:28.151
No. I've been doing some
digging into that mystery blonde.

22:28.152 --> 22:30.754
Uh... you mean the reporter?

22:30.755 --> 22:33.657
She is no more a reporter
than she was Lars' neighbor.

22:33.658 --> 22:35.826
What? She lied to you again?

22:35.827 --> 22:37.861
This is the real Lindsay Dillon,

22:37.862 --> 22:40.664
a 65-year-old black woman
living in Tallahassee.

22:40.665 --> 22:43.600
Oh. So, what's this blonde's angle?

22:43.601 --> 22:44.835
I wish I knew.

22:44.836 --> 22:46.470
She lies out of one side of her mouth,

22:46.471 --> 22:48.338
helps with the investigation
out of the other.

22:48.339 --> 22:49.740
It just doesn't make any sense.

22:49.741 --> 22:51.008
Well, I mean, for all we know,

22:51.009 --> 22:52.512
she could be working with the killer,

22:52.513 --> 22:54.244
trying to steer us in
the wrong direction.

22:54.245 --> 22:57.614
Twice, she just vanished on me.

22:57.615 --> 22:59.783
Vanished on me.

22:59.784 --> 23:01.217
Castle?

23:02.253 --> 23:05.789
Appearing and disappearing at will,

23:05.790 --> 23:08.892
being both deceptive and helpful?

23:08.893 --> 23:11.662
The mystery blonde is Lars' ronin genie,

23:11.663 --> 23:13.430
wandering the earth, waiting
for someone to find her lamp.

23:13.431 --> 23:15.032
She's chosen to appear to me.

23:15.033 --> 23:16.366
That's it. I'm cutting you off.

23:16.367 --> 23:18.502
No, no, no, no, no. She's...
She's given me clues, Beckett.

23:18.503 --> 23:19.836
She wants me to find the lamp.

23:19.837 --> 23:21.672
I think she wants me
to be her new master.

23:21.673 --> 23:23.140
And you know what I think?

23:23.141 --> 23:25.475
You need to call me the next time
you see her so I can question her.

23:25.476 --> 23:26.677
I got to come up with a wish list.

23:26.678 --> 23:27.778
Oh, my God. I have so many!

23:27.779 --> 23:29.413
How am I gonna whittle
it down to three?!

23:29.414 --> 23:30.648
That's funny. I just have one.

23:30.649 --> 23:31.415
What's that?

23:31.416 --> 23:32.879
That my man would stop talking about

23:32.880 --> 23:34.751
being some skeezy blonde's master

23:34.752 --> 23:36.720
and would start talking about taking...

23:36.721 --> 23:38.224
...his wife to bed.

23:38.225 --> 23:39.690
Oh, well...

23:39.691 --> 23:41.625
I don't need a genie...

23:41.626 --> 23:42.626
to grant that wish.

23:47.832 --> 23:50.601
Yo, hey, Cap, so, we
cross-checked customs' records

23:50.602 --> 23:52.985
with the date that Harlin said
Lars shipped the antiquities.

23:52.986 --> 23:54.972
One ship left port that day in Istanbul,

23:54.973 --> 23:57.407
and the only cargo that
it dropped off in New York

23:57.408 --> 23:59.409
was a shipment to this man, Yuruk Sezen.

23:59.410 --> 24:02.512
He runs a rug-import business
with a storefront in SoHo.

24:02.513 --> 24:04.047
So, obviously, he's our shipper.

24:04.048 --> 24:05.243
Yeah, we're headed there now.

24:05.244 --> 24:06.844
Hopefully, he still has the antiquities.

24:06.868 --> 24:08.352
Including the, uh, magic lamp.

24:08.353 --> 24:11.121
Uh, guys, guys?

24:11.122 --> 24:13.256
If you find that lamp
and Castle's not there,

24:13.257 --> 24:14.992
I'm never gonna hear the end of it.

24:14.993 --> 24:16.326
We'll have him meet us there.

24:16.327 --> 24:18.228
Okay, great. Ooh, can you just...

24:18.229 --> 24:21.064
can you make sure that he gets
dibs on the first rub, please?

24:21.065 --> 24:22.933
- Hm.
- Mm-hmm.

24:22.934 --> 24:24.633
Good. Thanks. I owe you.

24:26.871 --> 24:29.371
Can't believe I said that.

24:37.982 --> 24:40.350
NYPD!

24:40.351 --> 24:42.452
NYPD!

24:42.453 --> 24:45.387
Are you in here?!

24:53.931 --> 24:54.931
Clear.

24:54.932 --> 24:55.799
I'm clear.

24:55.800 --> 24:56.767
Clear.

24:56.768 --> 24:58.501
Looks like Yuruk skipped town.

24:59.604 --> 25:01.138
Why are you playing with the carpets?

25:01.139 --> 25:03.839
I'm checking if they're
magic. Think about it.

25:09.013 --> 25:11.014
Guys?

25:11.015 --> 25:13.516
This carpet's bleeding.

25:18.656 --> 25:20.023
Déjà vu.

25:26.043 --> 25:29.021
Check out these bruises. Just like Lars.

25:29.022 --> 25:31.256
Duct tape on his chest,
wrists, and ankles.

25:31.257 --> 25:32.791
Someone must have tied him up, too.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.626
So, apart from the fully detached head,

25:34.627 --> 25:37.162
the M.O.'s identical to
Lars... tortured, then killed.

25:37.163 --> 25:39.131
Well, clearly, Yuruk's not our killer.

25:39.132 --> 25:42.634
Well, the true killer must have
tortured Lars to get to Yuruk.

25:42.635 --> 25:45.036
Then tortured Yuruk to get
to those stolen antiquities.

25:46.072 --> 25:48.574
This body's still warm.
The killer was just here.

25:48.575 --> 25:49.678
Castle, go call for backup.

25:49.679 --> 25:51.910
- Wait for them out front.
- Right.

25:54.881 --> 25:56.615
Hey, Beckett. Yeah.

25:56.616 --> 25:58.550
No, right now, they're
securing the back.

25:58.551 --> 26:00.686
All right. We'll be here.

26:06.259 --> 26:07.458
The genie.

26:08.495 --> 26:10.095
It's the genie.

26:12.000 --> 26:18.074

26:21.441 --> 26:23.776
I knew it was you!

26:23.777 --> 26:25.444
You... You are not
who I thought you were.

26:25.445 --> 26:26.945
I'm so sorry. Have a lovely day.

27:17.664 --> 27:19.898
Ah, my back.

27:45.191 --> 27:47.592
I'm gonna need that back.

27:49.028 --> 27:50.963
Sure. Let me just dust it off.

27:50.964 --> 27:52.965
Uh, ah-ah, hands!

27:52.966 --> 27:54.900
Travis, hurry it up! We've got company!

27:54.901 --> 27:56.502
- Who the hell are you?
- Nobody.

27:56.503 --> 27:58.270
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.

27:58.271 --> 27:59.838
So you're nobody doing nothing?

27:59.839 --> 28:01.473
Pleased to meet you. I...

28:01.474 --> 28:05.210
would love to chat, but,
uh, you are obviously busy

28:05.211 --> 28:07.713
in whatever clearly legal
endeavor you're engaged in.

28:07.714 --> 28:09.715
- Are you a cop?
- No, no, not a cop.

28:09.716 --> 28:10.949
Good.

28:10.950 --> 28:12.893
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What
if... What if I was a cop?

28:12.894 --> 28:14.219
Either way, I'm gonna kill you.

28:14.220 --> 28:16.321
You shoot me, I drop this,

28:16.322 --> 28:18.190
and it breaks into a million pieces.

28:18.191 --> 28:19.725
It's okay. I've got a dozen more.

28:19.726 --> 28:21.059
But do they have a genie?

28:21.060 --> 28:22.693
What are you, 5 years old?

28:23.496 --> 28:25.531
I'm sorry, pal. I got
to do what I got to do.

28:25.532 --> 28:26.998
I really wish you wouldn't!

28:39.979 --> 28:42.414
You are a genie!

28:43.483 --> 28:45.217
Come on.

28:45.218 --> 28:46.451
I... The lamp!

28:46.452 --> 28:47.515
But your lamp! It's yours!

28:47.516 --> 28:48.648
Leave it!

29:06.806 --> 29:09.174
Couldn't you have just flown
us out of there on a carpet?

29:09.175 --> 29:10.278
What are you talking about?

29:10.279 --> 29:11.476
You can't make carpets fly?

29:11.477 --> 29:12.477
Can you?

29:12.478 --> 29:13.478
I'm not a genie.

29:13.479 --> 29:14.513
Neither am I.

29:14.514 --> 29:15.868
Yeah, something a genie would say

29:15.869 --> 29:17.372
because they're liars and tricksters.

29:17.373 --> 29:18.283
By that logic,

29:18.284 --> 29:19.985
any liar could be a genie.

29:19.986 --> 29:22.955
Well, we've caught you now,
and you're not going anywhere.

29:22.956 --> 29:24.623
The cops are right over there.

29:24.624 --> 29:27.091
And you're gonna tell
us everything you know.

29:27.894 --> 29:29.193
Come on!

29:30.412 --> 29:32.287
By the time we put a net
over the neighborhood,

29:32.288 --> 29:33.965
the truck and the treasure were gone,

29:33.966 --> 29:36.147
and because you didn't
get a license plate,

29:36.148 --> 29:37.692
we have little chance of finding them.

29:37.693 --> 29:38.883
It all happened so fast.

29:38.884 --> 29:41.518
Oh, right, and yet you did have time

29:41.519 --> 29:43.920
to "creep over to the lamp, examine it,

29:43.921 --> 29:46.089
get held at gunpoint, rub the lamp,

29:46.090 --> 29:49.026
make a wish upon the lamp,
and have a genie appear

29:49.027 --> 29:52.362
in a puff of smoke and
knock the 'woman thug'

29:52.363 --> 29:54.231
over the head with a 2x4."

29:54.232 --> 29:56.352
You forgot the part where
it was dark and super dusty.

29:56.376 --> 29:57.401
Castle, you're just lucky

29:57.402 --> 29:59.036
that Lanie was able to
pull DNA off Yuruk's body.

29:59.037 --> 30:00.270
Did she manage to get a match?

30:00.271 --> 30:01.405
No, but she was able

30:01.406 --> 30:03.707
to determine that the
killer was a female.

30:03.708 --> 30:05.491
Most likely the woman
holding me at gunpoint.

30:05.492 --> 30:07.544
Or your magical, blond genie.

30:07.545 --> 30:09.012
The one only Castle's seen.

30:09.013 --> 30:10.147
Mm. Wait a minute.

30:10.148 --> 30:11.581
So, neither of you believe me?

30:11.582 --> 30:13.684
Oh, no, bro, I-I do believe you.

30:13.685 --> 30:15.519
I actually... I was
able to I.D. the genie

30:15.520 --> 30:16.586
based on your description.

30:16.587 --> 30:17.587
Good work.

30:23.961 --> 30:26.296
Laugh it up, you guys. I
still have two wishes left.

30:26.297 --> 30:28.165
I'm not above using them for evil.

30:28.166 --> 30:29.399
- Dad?
- Ah, Alexis.

30:29.400 --> 30:30.767
Good, great.

30:30.768 --> 30:34.037
Tell these guys am I not
crazy for believing in a genie.

30:34.038 --> 30:36.940
And before you answer,
remember, I spent six months

30:36.941 --> 30:39.042
making an extra lunch
for your imaginary friend.

30:39.043 --> 30:42.079
- Really?
- Guys, I was 7, but you're not crazy.

30:42.080 --> 30:43.513
The mystery blonde is real.

30:43.514 --> 30:44.414
Thank you!

30:44.415 --> 30:46.116
But she's not a genie.

30:46.117 --> 30:47.751
Her name is Genevieve Sutton.

30:47.752 --> 30:49.175
She has an office on Second Avenue.

30:49.176 --> 30:50.787
She's listed as a security consultant.

30:50.788 --> 30:51.955
A fixer by the sound of it.

30:51.956 --> 30:53.516
Now, how did you get this info, Alexis?

30:53.540 --> 30:55.559
Well, after Dad left, I
dusted his desk for prints.

30:55.560 --> 30:56.893
Got a little help from Hayley,

30:56.894 --> 31:00.162
who ran them through the
DMV database, and voilà.

31:02.767 --> 31:04.167
So she's not a genie?

31:04.168 --> 31:05.268
Sorry.

31:05.269 --> 31:06.870
Genevieve is short for "genie."

31:06.871 --> 31:08.772
I-I mean, seriously,
if she can grant wishes,

31:08.773 --> 31:11.041
a-a-a driver's license, that
would be a piece of cake.

31:11.042 --> 31:13.009
Mm-hmm, but why would
a genie want to do that?

31:13.010 --> 31:14.277
Oh, seriously, who cares?

31:14.278 --> 31:16.179
Make-believe time with Castle is over.

31:16.180 --> 31:19.014
We're gonna bring in Genevieve
and find out the real story.

31:21.819 --> 31:23.386
Someone need some ice cream?

31:23.387 --> 31:25.754
- Me.
- Yeah.

31:30.194 --> 31:32.863
Castle, what...

31:32.864 --> 31:34.931
You may have everyone
else fooled, but not me.

31:34.932 --> 31:36.299
Castle, let me in.

31:36.300 --> 31:37.267
I am your master.

31:37.268 --> 31:38.691
I command you to tell me the truth.

31:38.692 --> 31:40.403
- Castle!
- Are you a genie or not?

31:40.404 --> 31:41.471
Can you let her in?

31:41.472 --> 31:43.607
Because you're seriously
weirding me out.

31:43.608 --> 31:44.948
I'm gonna take that as a maybe.

31:47.211 --> 31:48.345
I would apologize,

31:48.346 --> 31:50.847
but his behavior is the
least of your worries.

31:50.848 --> 31:53.350
You are accused of two homicides

31:53.351 --> 31:56.453
and connected to the
theft and trafficking

31:56.454 --> 31:58.722
of millions of dollars in antiquities,

31:58.723 --> 32:00.891
so your best bet is to start talking.

32:00.892 --> 32:03.026
Look, I didn't kill
anyone, and I was trying

32:03.027 --> 32:05.562
to keep the relics from
falling into the wrong hands.

32:05.563 --> 32:08.331
And I would've, too, if I
hadn't had to save your...

32:08.332 --> 32:10.233
reality-challenged husband.

32:10.234 --> 32:12.035
I prefer fantasy-augmented.

32:12.036 --> 32:13.904
Uh, what do you mean by "wrong hands"?

32:13.905 --> 32:16.206
Lars was hired to
excavate the antiquities

32:16.207 --> 32:17.541
in order to protect them.

32:17.542 --> 32:18.742
Hired by who?

32:18.743 --> 32:21.845
An anonymous benefactor.
Let's call him Mr. X.

32:21.846 --> 32:25.115
With the Syrian conflict threatening
to spill over into Turkey,

32:25.116 --> 32:28.652
Mr. X became concerned that
Solomon's tomb would be destroyed

32:28.653 --> 32:31.788
or worse, looted and the
relics sold to fund terrorism.

32:31.789 --> 32:34.457
And you know all of this how?

32:34.458 --> 32:37.260
Mr. X retained my
services in order to ensure

32:37.261 --> 32:39.696
Lars recovered the artifacts from Yuruk.

32:39.697 --> 32:41.731
But instead, Lars ended up dead.

32:41.732 --> 32:43.200
Unfortunately.

32:43.201 --> 32:44.734
The night that Lars was murdered,

32:44.735 --> 32:46.870
I was pulled away on a false lead.

32:46.871 --> 32:49.439
When I got back, the
cops were everywhere.

32:49.440 --> 32:50.874
So I targeted Mr. Castle

32:50.875 --> 32:53.310
as a way to learn what the police knew.

32:53.311 --> 32:56.246
I don't suppose you got the
license plate of that truck

32:56.247 --> 32:58.582
as you were... saving me?

32:58.583 --> 33:00.083
No.

33:00.084 --> 33:01.684
But I did before I saved you.

33:03.254 --> 33:05.355
State police just found the truck.

33:05.356 --> 33:08.258
We're tapped into a live feed
from a rest stop outside of Rye.

33:08.259 --> 33:09.722
We've got eyes on the truck.

33:09.723 --> 33:11.795
Do you have confirmation of passengers?

33:11.796 --> 33:14.264
Affirmative. Two
passengers... male and female,

33:14.265 --> 33:15.888
fitting the descriptions
of the suspects.

33:18.803 --> 33:22.405
Oh, hey, babe. Sorry, It's not
really a good time right now.

33:22.406 --> 33:23.940
What?

33:23.941 --> 33:25.442
Uh, yeah.

33:25.443 --> 33:27.377
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I-I
will be right there.

33:27.378 --> 33:29.646
Um, hey, guys...

33:29.647 --> 33:30.680
Jenny's having the baby.

33:30.681 --> 33:31.784
- Oh!
- That's awesome, man.

33:31.785 --> 33:32.983
Yeah, that's great! Go, go!

33:32.984 --> 33:34.684
- Call me, bro.
- Yeah!

33:34.685 --> 33:37.554
Hold on. Suspects are exiting the truck.

33:37.555 --> 33:38.722
Do we have a green light?

33:38.723 --> 33:39.923
Affirmative.

33:39.924 --> 33:42.659
NYPD! Get down! Guns, guns!

33:49.433 --> 33:51.735
Captain, what's your status?

33:51.736 --> 33:54.804
Male suspect is down.
Medic is treating him now.

33:54.805 --> 33:57.140
We have the female suspect in custody.

33:57.141 --> 34:00.777
This is Captain Beckett. Is
there anything in that truck?

34:00.778 --> 34:04.381
Affirmative. I count 11 crates.

34:04.382 --> 34:06.116
Genevieve said that there would be 12.

34:06.117 --> 34:08.183
I bet I know which crate is missing.

34:09.687 --> 34:12.255
Where's the lamp, Phoebe?

34:12.255 --> 34:15.759
You've got one chance
to help yourself here.

34:15.760 --> 34:17.427
Now, we know you didn't kill Yuruk.

34:17.428 --> 34:19.029
Traffic cams put you and the truck

34:19.030 --> 34:21.331
on the other side of the
city when he was murdered.

34:21.331 --> 34:24.000
And that makes you and Travis
little more than the hired help.

34:24.001 --> 34:26.703
So I'd do myself a
favor and start talking,

34:26.704 --> 34:29.906
beginning with who you
delivered the lamp to.

34:29.907 --> 34:34.543
I might be hired help,
but I ain't no rat.

34:36.147 --> 34:38.081
I want a lawyer.

34:38.081 --> 34:41.083
I know my rights.

34:45.679 --> 34:47.223
DNA confirms that our killer's a woman

34:47.224 --> 34:48.927
but someone with
resources and connections,

34:48.928 --> 34:50.193
not this flunky.

34:50.194 --> 34:52.829
A killer who knew Lars, a woman who...

34:52.830 --> 34:54.797
would risk losing the entire shipment

34:54.799 --> 34:56.764
for the ultimate prize... the lamp.

34:58.502 --> 35:00.369
And I know just the
person to lead us to it.

35:03.175 --> 35:05.498
Dr. Baker, thank you
again for coming to see us.

35:05.499 --> 35:06.894
Well, how could I resist

35:06.895 --> 35:09.159
when you told me you found
the genie from Aladdin's lamp?

35:09.160 --> 35:11.669
That was a little bit of a white lie.

35:12.134 --> 35:13.779
Yeah, see, we were looking back

35:13.780 --> 35:16.348
over Lars' school records from Columbia.

35:16.349 --> 35:18.851
It turns out he actually
audited a class of yours

35:18.852 --> 35:20.985
at Hudson University a few years back.

35:22.923 --> 35:25.291
I have hundreds of students every year.

35:25.292 --> 35:26.892
I'm afraid I can't remember all of them.

35:26.916 --> 35:29.261
That's strange. Your T.A.
remembers that you and Lars

35:29.262 --> 35:31.564
would meet regularly
during your office hours.

35:31.565 --> 35:33.766
In fact, he said that
you guys met the morning

35:33.767 --> 35:35.234
that Lars returned from Turkey.

35:35.235 --> 35:37.570
Now, Lars, I'm sure,
shared the discovery

35:37.571 --> 35:39.126
of the lamp with you, knowing that you

35:39.127 --> 35:40.750
of all people would
appreciate its value,

35:40.751 --> 35:44.110
but what he wasn't counting on
was your professional jealousy.

35:44.111 --> 35:46.112
Why on earth would I be jealous?

35:46.113 --> 35:47.913
You've been searching
for King Solomon's tomb

35:47.914 --> 35:49.415
for over 15 years.

35:49.416 --> 35:51.039
We talked to the dean
of your department.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.651
He told us about your obsession.

35:52.652 --> 35:55.154
How it ruined your marriage
and nearly destroyed you.

35:55.155 --> 35:56.755
That is not true.

35:56.756 --> 35:59.091
Because you never found that tomb.

35:59.092 --> 36:02.528
Now, that must have been
a bitter pill to swallow,

36:02.529 --> 36:05.397
knowing that Lars used all
of your hard-earned research

36:05.398 --> 36:07.366
to find something you never could.

36:07.367 --> 36:09.902
And now he was gonna get
all the fame and fortune

36:09.903 --> 36:11.270
that you never would.

36:11.271 --> 36:15.074
Mr. Castle, you really do
have an overactive imagination.

36:15.075 --> 36:17.443
You could no more prove
that story you just spun

36:17.444 --> 36:19.678
than you could prove that
genies come out of lamps

36:19.679 --> 36:21.080
and grant three wishes.

36:21.081 --> 36:23.449
Actually, that's not true.

36:23.450 --> 36:25.251
Uniforms searched your home.

36:25.252 --> 36:26.619
They found the lamp.

36:26.620 --> 36:30.055
I guess you're as
good at hiding treasure

36:30.056 --> 36:31.557
as you are at finding it.

36:31.558 --> 36:35.361
Dr. Baker, you're under arrest
for the murder of Lars Cross

36:35.362 --> 36:36.795
and Yuruk Sezen.

36:44.437 --> 36:46.038
You better watch out, Castle.

36:46.039 --> 36:47.606
I may have to steal your blonde.

36:47.607 --> 36:48.874
I still have two wishes left.

36:48.875 --> 36:51.138
All the rubbing in the world's
not gonna do you any good.

36:51.139 --> 36:53.562
Can I get a "That's what she said"?

36:55.282 --> 36:56.582
Oh, who's that?

36:56.583 --> 36:59.451
Prince Khalid Hasheim of
the Jordanian royal family.

36:59.452 --> 37:00.786
He's here to bail out Genevieve.

37:00.787 --> 37:03.054
Methinks we've found
our mysterious Mr. X.

37:05.525 --> 37:08.594
Prince Hasheim, I'm Captain Beckett.

37:08.595 --> 37:09.962
This is Mr. Castle.

37:09.963 --> 37:12.064
Or perhaps we should call you Mr. X?

37:12.065 --> 37:13.619
Mr. X is my employer.

37:13.620 --> 37:17.256
He paid me to protect the
contents of Solomon's Tomb.

37:17.257 --> 37:18.791
Right, well, I don't
know this gentleman,

37:18.792 --> 37:20.872
but anyone who helps protect
the history of my region

37:20.873 --> 37:21.739
is to be applauded.

37:21.740 --> 37:22.431
Of course.

37:22.432 --> 37:23.499
So, what's gonna happen

37:23.500 --> 37:24.867
to the antiquities and the lamp now?

37:24.868 --> 37:26.301
Well, I'm no expert, but given the way

37:26.302 --> 37:27.436
that they entered the country

37:27.437 --> 37:29.031
and their connection to a murder trial,

37:29.032 --> 37:30.855
they'll be tied up in
legal battles for years.

37:30.856 --> 37:33.008
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

37:33.009 --> 37:35.310
I'm sure that Mr. X
will be very disappointed

37:35.311 --> 37:37.880
considering he worked
so hard to procure them.

37:37.881 --> 37:39.481
I don't know about that, Captain.

37:39.482 --> 37:41.250
If one wished to keep
priceless history safe

37:41.251 --> 37:42.684
from looters and terrorists,

37:42.685 --> 37:44.989
there is no better place for
them to wait out the conflict

37:44.990 --> 37:46.723
than in the basement of the Smithsonian.

37:48.658 --> 37:50.259
It was a pleasure meeting you both.

37:50.260 --> 37:52.060
Come along, Genie.

37:52.061 --> 37:53.127
Here we go again.

37:55.031 --> 37:56.465
That... She was... That...

37:56.466 --> 37:58.049
So, I just got off the phone with Ryan.

37:58.050 --> 38:01.385
There's been some complications
with Jenny's labor.

38:07.143 --> 38:09.545
Hey.

38:09.546 --> 38:12.114
Everything was normal, uh...

38:12.115 --> 38:13.782
until Jenny started hyperventilating.

38:13.783 --> 38:17.019
She lost consciousness.

38:17.020 --> 38:20.989
Doctors think it might be a,
uh, amniotic fluid embolism.

38:20.990 --> 38:24.893
But they're... they're
trying to stabilize her now...

38:24.894 --> 38:29.231
so that, uh... they
can deliver the baby.

38:29.232 --> 38:30.966
We're here, bro, whatever you need.

38:30.967 --> 38:32.234
Thanks.

38:32.235 --> 38:33.535
Thanks.

38:33.536 --> 38:35.336
I should get back in there.

38:40.910 --> 38:42.843
Let's settle in.

38:51.454 --> 38:55.324
Hey, so, um obviously, I don't believe

38:55.325 --> 38:57.526
in genies or wishes, but just in case,

38:57.527 --> 39:00.162
I was wondering if you
could one of your wishes

39:00.163 --> 39:01.496
for Jenny and the baby.

39:01.497 --> 39:02.831
I already did.

39:02.832 --> 39:04.399
Both of them.

39:04.400 --> 39:05.667
Okay.

39:08.905 --> 39:10.305
Hey.

39:10.306 --> 39:11.707
Hey.

39:11.708 --> 39:16.177
Uh, doctors... they
stabilized Jenny, and...

39:17.680 --> 39:19.314
...she delivered a healthy baby boy.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.316
- Yes!
- Whoo!

39:22.819 --> 39:24.319
What's his name?

39:24.320 --> 39:28.323
- Oh.
- His name is Nicholas...

39:28.324 --> 39:30.292
Javier Ryan.

39:30.293 --> 39:31.959
Aww.

39:34.697 --> 39:36.840
Tell me you spelled it right
on the birth certificate.

39:36.841 --> 39:38.233
Aww, I want one, too.

39:40.103 --> 39:42.237
So, if you see that, uh, genie again,

39:42.238 --> 39:43.781
you mind telling her I said thank you?

39:43.782 --> 39:45.807
Oh, I think I'm all done with genies.

39:45.808 --> 39:46.975
What?

39:46.976 --> 39:48.543
Why the change of heart?

39:48.544 --> 39:50.212
Well, because of you, of course.

39:50.213 --> 39:51.313
Oh, really?

39:51.314 --> 39:53.137
So, after eight years,
some of my common sense

39:53.138 --> 39:54.416
has finally rubbed off on you?

39:54.417 --> 39:56.485
No. No, no, no, nothing like that.

39:56.486 --> 39:57.619
Um...

39:57.620 --> 39:59.855
I have no need for genies simply because

39:59.856 --> 40:02.658
I already have everything
I could ever wish for.

40:02.659 --> 40:05.560
I...

40:05.561 --> 40:07.661
Right back at ya, handsome.

40:10.233 --> 40:12.768
Oh, wait, um, so, you
wouldn't even wish for

40:12.769 --> 40:14.002
a working lightsaber?

40:15.338 --> 40:17.406
Nope.

40:17.407 --> 40:19.975
Okay. Transporter, like
the ones in "Star Trek"?

40:19.976 --> 40:21.359
You would never have to fly again.

40:21.360 --> 40:22.144
I like flying.

40:22.145 --> 40:23.211
Huh.

40:23.212 --> 40:24.947
Time machine?

40:24.948 --> 40:27.582
Only to go back and fall in
love with you all over again.

40:27.583 --> 40:29.184
Wow, that was a good answer.

40:29.185 --> 40:30.918
I know, right?

40:33.690 --> 40:34.890
Make way, Daddy.

40:36.726 --> 40:37.659
How's Jenny?

40:37.660 --> 40:38.860
Oh, she's exhausted.
