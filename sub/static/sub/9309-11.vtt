Please believe me when I tell you,

00:12.398 --> 00:14.848
the party you're going to

00:16.318 --> 00:18.352
Jerome?

00:18.437 --> 00:22.356
Does Jerome have 30 days sober?
I don't think so.

00:22.408 --> 00:25.492
You got to learn to appreciate
a quiet night in.

00:25.528 --> 00:28.278

That's why you've got me.

- Morning.

01:27.773 --> 01:29.974
Did you read the label?

01:30.059 --> 01:31.358
I know how to make coffee.

01:31.394 --> 01:35.145
- Your last pot tasted like motor oil.
- That was an anomaly.

01:35.231 --> 01:36.947
How was I supposed to know
it was espresso beans?

01:37.033 --> 01:38.699
By reading the label.

01:38.734 --> 01:40.901
Well, obviously, this time
I read the label,

01:40.953 --> 01:44.288
and I just happen
to like espresso beans.

01:44.373 --> 01:46.373
- Mm-hmm.
- And if it's too strong for you...

01:46.409 --> 01:48.242
...that's too bad because I'm
gonna drink it [cellphone buzzes]

01:48.294 --> 01:49.660
- just like it is.
- That's right.

01:49.745 --> 01:52.830
You are. Every drop.

- Yes, I'm sure. [cellphone beeps]

02:01.140 --> 02:02.673
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

02:02.758 --> 02:04.892
Where is Maura?
We're gonna be late.

02:04.927 --> 02:06.427
<i>Maura: I'm here.</i>

02:09.431 --> 02:13.851
- What are you doing?
- I've got some lower back pain,

02:13.936 --> 02:16.270
so I'm attempting
a new relaxation technique.

02:17.940 --> 02:20.274
[breathes deeply]

02:20.359 --> 02:23.243
It looks like lying
on the floor and sighing.

02:23.279 --> 02:26.030
Well, it's more sophisticated than that.

02:26.115 --> 02:29.416
- Well, do you feel relaxed?
- Not entirely.

02:29.452 --> 02:31.418
How about now?

No, I can't help you.

02:38.461 --> 02:41.344

02:42.431 --> 02:44.348
Yes, I'm sure.
I d...

02:44.433 --> 02:46.100

Oh, really? With the
heavy breathing? Come on.

02:53.476 --> 02:55.943
And why are you getting
an escort at this hour?

02:55.978 --> 02:57.784
Shouldn't you be at work?

02:58.147 --> 03:00.911
Well, shouldn't you be looking for work?

03:01.817 --> 03:03.200
No, I will not help you
"work on your résumé."

03:03.285 --> 03:04.651
Gross.
[cellphone beeps]

03:04.737 --> 03:06.070
You know, you are a public servant,

03:06.155 --> 03:07.454
and clearly this guy
needs some service.

03:07.490 --> 03:09.073
Oh, shut up and drink your sludge.

03:09.158 --> 03:10.908
I don't know what happened.

03:10.993 --> 03:14.378
A-A telemarketer must have
gotten my number, you know,

03:14.463 --> 03:15.829
and ... and...
[cellphone buzzes]

03:15.881 --> 03:18.916
Ugh.
I'm done. [cellphone beeps]

03:19.001 --> 03:20.250
Listen to me, you pervert.

03:20.336 --> 03:22.002
I don't have the time...
[cellphone buzzes]

03:22.088 --> 03:23.420
...to facilitate some weird fantasy

03:23.506 --> 03:26.807

And I block every single one of them.
This is getting ridiculous.

04:07.049 --> 04:08.882
Well, perhaps the department
could issue you a new number.

04:08.968 --> 04:10.350
I've put the request in.

04:10.386 --> 04:11.885
They're just taking
their sweet time about it.

04:11.937 --> 04:16.305
- It sounds awful.
- One guy asked me to...

04:16.392 --> 04:18.192
"wax his banister."

04:18.226 --> 04:21.361
- That's not a thing.
- I know. Nobody calls it that.

04:21.397 --> 04:24.031
- Well, what did you say?
- W...

04:24.066 --> 04:28.735
I can't, um, say... to you...
right now.

04:28.821 --> 04:32.239
- What are we talking about?
- Euphemisms for the male phallus.

04:34.376 --> 04:36.160
Victim is Dan Walsh, 27.

04:36.245 --> 04:38.295
According to his landlord,
he lived here about two years.

04:38.380 --> 04:41.131
- Is he a parolee?
- He worked for a nonprofit

04:41.217 --> 04:43.167
that keeps troubled kids off the street.

04:43.252 --> 04:44.218
I guess he lived where he worked.

04:44.253 --> 04:46.920
No witnesses.
Struggles and arguments

04:46.972 --> 04:48.472
are pretty much par for
the course around here.

04:48.557 --> 04:51.925
- Security systems?
- [scoffs] Padlocks and baseball bats.

04:51.977 --> 04:55.179
- Definitely no cameras.
- Maybe it's just a robbery gone wrong.

04:55.264 --> 04:56.563
Left his wallet and cellphone behind.

04:56.599 --> 05:00.267
- I think someone just wanted him dead.
- Which he is.

05:00.319 --> 05:01.768
We know how?

05:01.854 --> 05:05.272
Subdural hemorrhaging around
the trachea and larynx.

05:05.324 --> 05:08.909
Acute cause of death
appears to be asphyxia.

05:08.944 --> 05:11.679
- So he was strangled.
- I'm inclined to say yes,

05:11.680 --> 05:14.448
though the ligature mark
is less distinct than I'd expect.

05:14.533 --> 05:17.217
According to his texts, he
died around 9:30 last night.

05:18.120 --> 05:20.337
That's consistent with
rigor and lividity.

05:20.422 --> 05:22.206
He has a selfie with his murderer.

05:22.291 --> 05:24.341
Yeah, too bad he didn't have
one of those selfie sticks.

05:24.426 --> 05:26.460
To use as a weapon.

05:26.545 --> 05:29.429
And achieve a universally
flattering angle.

05:36.272 --> 05:39.139
- Hey.
- Dan Walsh.

05:39.225 --> 05:41.808
DMV records show he moved to
Boston about two years ago.

05:41.894 --> 05:43.360
Originally from Los Angeles.

05:43.445 --> 05:45.612
He have any family here or
anybody we could talk to?

05:45.648 --> 05:48.615
Doesn't seem to. He's just
been living at that one address

05:48.651 --> 05:50.117
and working at the
center for troubled teens.

05:50.152 --> 05:51.568
Maybe one of the kids
turned against him.

05:51.654 --> 05:55.239
A co-worker said he was a rock star.
And every kid we talked to

05:55.324 --> 05:57.040
said he's the reason why they
turned their lives around.

05:57.126 --> 05:59.877
He didn't have an emergency
contact in his DMV records,

05:59.962 --> 06:02.212
and I can't find a last-known
address in California.

06:02.298 --> 06:04.915
According to social security,
there's no work history, either.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.168
- Oh, so he's a criminal.
- A lot of people at the center

06:08.254 --> 06:09.887
said he was secretive about his past.

06:09.972 --> 06:13.340
Okay, so he's got a troubled
past, he goes straight,

06:13.392 --> 06:14.841
starts working with kids

06:14.927 --> 06:16.393
so they don't make the
same mistake he does.

06:16.478 --> 06:17.561
Maybe his past caught up to him.

06:17.646 --> 06:20.397
- I buy it.
- I would, too, except he doesn't have a record.

06:20.482 --> 06:21.848
Prints are clean.

06:21.934 --> 06:23.483
Well, that just means
he didn't get caught.

06:23.519 --> 06:26.653
- We running him through NCIC?
- As we speak.

06:26.689 --> 06:29.289
Well, maybe he's wanted
for questioning somewhere,

06:29.358 --> 06:32.192
or he got a parking ticket in Topeka.

06:32.278 --> 06:34.528
<i>Anything to help us figure
out what his story is.</i>

06:34.613 --> 06:37.247
And why he's dead.

06:41.120 --> 06:44.037
- How's it coming?
- Good. I mean, not for him.

06:44.089 --> 06:46.373
- He's dead.
- From?

06:46.458 --> 06:49.209
Ligature-strangulation homicide.

06:49.295 --> 06:51.545
The abrasions appear to be scratches

06:51.597 --> 06:56.099
- from the victim's own fingernails.
- Ah, he put up a fight.

06:56.185 --> 06:58.051
Do we know what he was strangled with?

06:58.103 --> 07:00.637
The faintness of the markings
suggests a soft material,

07:00.723 --> 07:02.222
like a necktie or a cloth.

07:02.308 --> 07:04.558
And based on the contusions
around the Adam's apple,

07:04.610 --> 07:07.394
it probably had a knot
tied in the middle.

07:07.479 --> 07:11.531
- Makes for a quicker kill.
- The hyoid bone was completely crushed.

07:11.567 --> 07:14.151
This killer knew what he was doing.

07:14.236 --> 07:15.986
There's a reason the fingerprints we ran

07:16.071 --> 07:17.571
didn't bring us
anything on Dan Walsh ...

07:17.623 --> 07:20.407
- that ain't Dan Walsh.
- Says who?

07:20.492 --> 07:23.660
Detective from Los Angeles robbery
homicide division just called.

07:23.746 --> 07:25.702
He said, "why are you running
Dan Walsh through NCIC?"

07:25.737 --> 07:27.080
I said, "well, he's a homicide victim."

07:27.166 --> 07:29.549
Detective says,
"huh. That's funny,"

07:29.585 --> 07:33.086
Because they have a Dan Walsh
on the table in their morgue.

07:33.138 --> 07:35.222
They have the same identity?

07:35.257 --> 07:37.174
Yeah, they were found dead
within three days of each other.

07:37.259 --> 07:39.593
Well, that can't be a coincidence.

07:39.678 --> 07:41.428
Well, do we know how
the L.A. victim died?

07:41.480 --> 07:43.789
He just said it was a likely
homicide. The body was found

07:43.790 --> 07:46.099
in a shallow grave, uncovered
by some construction workers.

07:46.151 --> 07:49.102
No I.D., but the fingerprints
and the dental records

07:49.154 --> 07:51.605
were definitive.
Their guy is Dan Walsh.

07:51.690 --> 07:55.320
- Which means our guy...
- Just became John Doe.

08:06.101 --> 08:08.302
L.A. coroner's office says Dan Walsh

08:08.354 --> 08:10.103
looks to have been dead
for about two years.

08:10.139 --> 08:12.932
Which is the exact time
that our guy has been

08:12.933 --> 08:15.726
living in Boston under
Dan Walsh's identity.

08:15.811 --> 08:18.145
So maybe our John Doe killed Dan Walsh

08:18.197 --> 08:20.731
and then stole his I.D.
to start a new life?

08:20.816 --> 08:23.400
Whitey Bulger lived under an
assumed identity for years.

08:23.485 --> 08:26.186
Yeah, but we ran his prints,

08:26.255 --> 08:28.322
and whoever this guy is,
he doesn't have a record.

08:28.374 --> 08:30.190
Still, he could be
running from something.

08:30.559 --> 08:35.128
Well, all we know for sure
is that in the past at some point,

08:35.164 --> 08:37.047
our John Doe intersected with Dan Walsh.

08:37.131 --> 08:39.883
- Yep.
- Or someone with Dan Walsh's I.D.

08:39.884 --> 08:41.717
All roads lead to Dan Walsh.

08:41.804 --> 08:44.671
So if we're gonna figure
out who our John Doe is...

08:44.757 --> 08:48.575
- Unh-unh. Don't say it!
- You are going to L.A.

08:48.610 --> 08:51.478
- Yes!
- No! Come on!

08:51.513 --> 08:55.015
I don't like to fly, and... 
and I get jet-lagged,

08:55.100 --> 08:57.684
and L.A. is so not my style.

08:57.770 --> 09:00.070
It's okay. 
We'll suck it up just this once.

09:00.155 --> 09:01.738
Not you, Frankie.

09:01.824 --> 09:03.740
The department will only pay
for one detective. [sighs]

09:03.826 --> 09:06.326
<i>But the homicide unit in
L.A. is eager to collaborate.</i>

09:06.362 --> 09:08.161
So is the coroner's office.

09:08.197 --> 09:10.664
I've been on the phone with
the L.A. coroner all morning.

09:10.699 --> 09:12.199
Initial findings of their victim

09:12.284 --> 09:14.701
suggest ligature-strangulation
homicide.

09:14.753 --> 09:16.286
The same as our guy.

09:16.372 --> 09:18.922
The thing is, no
autopsy's been performed,

09:19.008 --> 09:21.341
and due to the backlog,
there isn't one scheduled.

09:21.377 --> 09:24.969
- Makes sense ... big city.
- Well... So is Boston.

09:25.004 --> 09:28.360
Yeah, but they don't have
Maura ... the backlog killer.

09:28.395 --> 09:29.828
Thank you.

09:30.052 --> 09:31.301
The details of the L.A. murder

09:31.387 --> 09:34.388
might inform our analysis
of John Doe's murder.

09:34.440 --> 09:37.107
Especially if they were
killed by the same person.

09:37.192 --> 09:39.226
Well, I offered to
come to L.A. personally

09:39.311 --> 09:41.728
and facilitate the
autopsy, and they agreed.

09:41.780 --> 09:43.981
Wait. So they both get to go?

09:44.066 --> 09:46.733
You're welcome to go with
them if you pay your own way.

09:46.819 --> 09:49.369
[sighs] 
Fine. I don't want to go.

09:49.405 --> 09:53.123
I'm gonna stay here and
drink espresso... naked.

09:54.293 --> 09:56.876
I'm gonna take a bath in espresso.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.081
I don't need that visual, bro.
[chuckles]

10:01.766 --> 10:05.752
- Well, this should be fun.
- Sox games are fun.

10:05.838 --> 10:08.388
Cronuts ... very fun!

10:08.424 --> 10:12.259
There's not really a word to
accurately describe Los Angeles.

10:12.344 --> 10:14.311
Well, maybe we can find
one while we're there.

10:15.693 --> 10:17.180

10:45.294 --> 10:46.960
Yeah. It's kind of weird.

10:47.046 --> 10:49.262
It's like you're here,
but you're not here.

10:49.298 --> 10:51.381

10:51.467 --> 10:54.267

10:54.303 --> 10:56.219
<i>- Roxbury.
- That's where I work!</i>

10:56.305 --> 10:59.556
<i>We're neighbors! [chuckles]
Okay, to upgrade your car,</i>

10:59.641 --> 11:01.475
<i>insert the credit card you want to use.</i>

11:01.560 --> 11:04.061
- Okay.
- Hello!

11:05.147 --> 11:07.230
What, really?
That's like your third one.

11:07.316 --> 11:08.482
I know. I can't help myself.

11:08.567 --> 11:10.317
There's a juice bar on every corner.

11:10.369 --> 11:12.486
<i>That looks delicious. Strawberry?</i>

11:12.571 --> 11:14.154
Strawberry mango.

11:14.239 --> 11:15.989
<i>Oh, this time of year?
[clicks tongue]</i>

11:16.041 --> 11:20.077
- Right? Look at all that vitamin A!
- How we doing?

11:20.162 --> 11:22.245
<i>Looks like the problem's
your credit card.</i>

11:22.331 --> 11:25.499
<i>- It was declined.
- It was?</i>

11:25.584 --> 11:27.634
Did you notify the bank
that you're traveling?

11:27.669 --> 11:31.588
- Sometimes that sets off a fraud alert.
- No, I guess I didn't.

11:31.673 --> 11:34.591
Yeah, but I don't want to
drive what BPD rented for us.

11:34.676 --> 11:37.177
It looks like a toaster
had sex with a clown car.

11:37.229 --> 11:41.565
[laughing] Okay. Okay.
Well, here.

11:41.650 --> 11:45.352
Let's splurge.
It is L.A., after all.

11:45.437 --> 11:47.437
<i>Anything particular in mind?</i>

11:47.523 --> 11:49.356
- Something stylish.
- And fast.

11:49.441 --> 11:52.909
- Tasteful. Not too flashy.
- Yeah, and really fast.

11:53.395 --> 11:55.195
<i>I got something.</i>

11:55.247 --> 11:56.580
Mm.

11:56.665 --> 12:00.200
[music]

12:00.285 --> 12:02.285
Hey, Vince.

12:02.371 --> 12:05.255
Liquor license renewal form...
it's all filled out.

12:05.340 --> 12:08.291
- You just have to sign it.
- Mm. I'll do it right now.

12:08.377 --> 12:13.547
- So, it looks like the girls made it to L.A.
- Safe and sound.

12:13.599 --> 12:17.551
Which means you and I
have a golden opportunity.

12:17.936 --> 12:21.221
- For what exactly?
- A double date.

12:21.273 --> 12:24.391
No snooping kids ...
you, Kiki, me, and Ron.

12:24.443 --> 12:25.559
- Well, that's a great idea.
- Mm.

12:25.644 --> 12:28.478
- I can't wait to meet Ron.
- And he can't wait to meet you guys.

12:28.564 --> 12:30.313
- How's tonight?
- I'll bring wine.

12:30.399 --> 12:31.731
All right.

12:31.784 --> 12:35.402
- How's 8:00-ish?
- Deal.

12:35.487 --> 12:39.739
- Good wine, Vince.
- Of course.

12:39.932 --> 12:42.183
[music]

12:45.520 --> 12:47.887
- Really?
- Bud Abbott!

12:47.940 --> 12:49.522
You can't just walk over him.

12:49.558 --> 12:53.193
It's a sidewalk, not a grave.

12:53.228 --> 12:57.731
- Ooh. [chuckles]
- Why do you get to drive?

12:57.816 --> 13:00.424
- You're not insured.
- Ugh!

13:02.571 --> 13:04.621
Really? You just happen to
have one of those things handy?

13:04.706 --> 13:08.491
- I mean, Jackie O.
- It's going to be windy.

13:08.577 --> 13:11.494
- Would you like one?
- No, I would like to drive.

13:11.580 --> 13:13.580
- Not today.
- Mm!

13:16.168 --> 13:18.718
Please start the car.

13:21.807 --> 13:23.173
[engine turns over]
[gasps]

13:23.258 --> 13:26.476
- It's a turbo.
- Yeah, it is.

13:26.561 --> 13:28.678
[engine revs, tires screech]

13:37.856 --> 13:41.574
If the discovery of Dan Walsh's body
prompted our victim's murder,

13:41.610 --> 13:42.909
then at least one other person

13:42.944 --> 13:44.778
knew he was living under
an assumed identity.

13:44.830 --> 13:46.913
But why would that
person want to kill him?

13:46.982 --> 13:50.283
Did the news of Dan Walsh's
body being dug up go national?

13:52.671 --> 13:54.371
Nope. Just a few
mentions on the local news

13:54.456 --> 13:55.755
and in the L.A. Times.

13:55.791 --> 13:58.174
Chances are that's where
the killer heard about it.

13:58.260 --> 13:59.793
Meaning that whoever did it is from L.A.

13:59.845 --> 14:01.961
Or was there at the time
Walsh's body was discovered.

14:02.014 --> 14:04.597
That would mean they had to
fly here to kill the imposter,

14:04.633 --> 14:06.466
given our timeline.

14:06.518 --> 14:08.768
Well, let's pull the manifests
from flights for L.A. to Boston

14:08.804 --> 14:10.353
around the time of John Doe's murder.

14:10.439 --> 14:13.189
- Okay.
- And then check those against the list

14:13.275 --> 14:15.191
of people making return
trips after the murder.

14:15.277 --> 14:17.861
- Gonna be a lot of names.
- Well, you got to start somewhere.

14:17.946 --> 14:19.479
And we're still interviewing
kids at the youth center,

14:19.564 --> 14:21.698
but so far, our John Doe
seems like a stand-up guy.

14:21.783 --> 14:25.702
- Whatever got him killed...
- It was from his past.

14:28.490 --> 14:30.490
[telephone rings,
indistinct conversations]

14:35.747 --> 14:39.299
- Oh. Detective Rizzoli?
- Yeah.

14:39.334 --> 14:40.417
- Oscar Acedo.
- Hey.

14:40.502 --> 14:41.835
- Welcome to our coast.
- Thank you.

14:41.920 --> 14:44.721
- Not in Kansas anymore, huh?
- You could say that.

14:44.806 --> 14:45.839
You let me know if I
can help you adjust.

14:45.924 --> 14:47.006
I'm L.A.-born-and-raised.

14:47.059 --> 14:48.758
Okay. How do I adjust to people

14:48.844 --> 14:52.762
who just walk right out in
front of cars? Moving cars?

14:52.848 --> 14:54.514
'Cause we almost killed two yoga moms

14:54.566 --> 14:56.433
and some guy dressed
as Edward Scissorhands

14:56.518 --> 14:57.901
on Hollywood Boulevard.
[laughs]

14:57.986 --> 15:00.353
Car always has to stop,
even if they're jaywalking.

15:00.439 --> 15:03.690
- It can get a little crazy.
- What do we got here?

15:03.775 --> 15:06.443
Dan Walsh ... last seen two years ago

15:06.528 --> 15:07.694
at a homeless shelter in Venice.

15:09.531 --> 15:12.866
- He was homeless?
- Yeah, but he was a regular at the shelter.

15:13.118 --> 15:14.617
I know what you're thinking.

15:14.703 --> 15:17.287
If a homeless shelter files a
missing persons for a transient,

15:17.372 --> 15:19.589
then surely someone noticed
when your John Doe disappeared.

15:19.674 --> 15:21.624
- That's exactly what I'm thinking.
- Me too.

15:21.710 --> 15:22.876
We're running a search

15:22.961 --> 15:25.295
for anyone resembling
your victim, as well.

15:25.380 --> 15:26.379
[footsteps approaching]

15:27.516 --> 15:29.382
Oh, this is Dr. Maura Isles.

15:29.434 --> 15:32.435
Chief medical examiner
of the commonwealth.

15:32.521 --> 15:35.638
We're lucky to have her expertise.

15:35.724 --> 15:38.391
Well, Dr. Hart has been
exceedingly welcoming.

15:38.443 --> 15:41.394
- We just returned from the autopsy.
- It was thrilling.

15:42.046 --> 15:45.398
- Was it?
- As we suspected, the victim

15:45.484 --> 15:47.650
suffered a fracture of
the laryngeal cartilage.

15:47.736 --> 15:50.286
Tell her about the disarticulation
of the hyoid horns.

15:50.372 --> 15:51.905
In a strangulation like this,

15:51.957 --> 15:53.823
the hyoid bone can shift to the side ...

15:53.909 --> 15:55.625
which side depends on
whether the assailant

15:55.710 --> 15:56.910
was left- or right-handed.

15:56.962 --> 16:00.580
This victim's pattern of disarticulation
was the same as our victim's.

16:00.632 --> 16:02.499
So they were killed by the same person.

16:02.584 --> 16:05.251
That's possible, but it's
also possible that the victims

16:05.337 --> 16:07.837
were killed by two different
left-hand dominant people.

16:07.923 --> 16:10.423
Of roughly the same
height and physical build.

16:10.509 --> 16:12.475
Because they were killed
by the same person.

16:12.961 --> 16:14.811
I wouldn't speculate.

16:16.734 --> 16:18.375
There are more of you.

16:18.767 --> 16:20.850
[computer beeping]
We got something here.

16:20.936 --> 16:27.440
- What, a hit on the search?
- Yeah, but it's not missing persons.

16:27.492 --> 16:31.077
- Obituaries.
- From two years ago.

16:31.112 --> 16:32.612
Well, it's a lovely tribute,

16:32.664 --> 16:34.279
but that guy wasn't
dead when they wrote it.

16:35.116 --> 16:37.066
That's our John Doe.

16:42.438 --> 16:45.172
<i>- Korsak: So, you got a hit.
- Jane: Yes. </i>

16:45.257 --> 16:47.141
<i>Our John Doe's name is Roger Parsons.</i>

16:47.176 --> 16:52.012
<i>Dan Walsh was last seen in
Los Angeles June 15, 2013.</i>

16:52.064 --> 16:54.014
<i>Oscar: Roger Parsons
supposedly committed suicide</i>

16:54.066 --> 16:57.101
<i>around that same time.
Obviously no body was recovered.</i>

16:57.186 --> 16:58.736
Because he wasn't dead.

16:58.821 --> 17:01.355
<i>It was a stunt.
He faked his own death, started over.</i>

17:01.407 --> 17:04.074
- Well, that how it looks.
- Do we know his connection with Walsh?

17:04.160 --> 17:08.362
So far, there isn't one.
They didn't seem to know each other.

17:08.414 --> 17:10.196
So, how did Roger become Dan?

17:10.281 --> 17:12.415
And what made him fake his
suicide in the first place?

17:12.501 --> 17:17.204
- I don't know.
- Well, I flew you to L.A. to find out.

17:17.256 --> 17:19.039
Oh, it wasn't for the
breakfast burritos?

17:19.125 --> 17:23.093
'Cause so far, that's all I like
about this place. No offense.

17:23.179 --> 17:28.098
<i>Burritos for breakfast?
This is so unfair.</i>

17:29.552 --> 17:33.087
[music]

17:34.490 --> 17:38.058
<i>Maura: I keep hearing this phrase ... 
"no worries."</i>

17:38.127 --> 17:41.061
- What's wrong with it?
- Well, I can't pin down the meaning.

17:41.113 --> 17:44.064
Is it a social pleasantry,
like "you're welcome"?

17:44.116 --> 17:46.283
Maybe it's more like
a blanket position, you know?

17:46.368 --> 17:47.901
Like "no nukes."

17:47.953 --> 17:50.454
Eh. I'll tell you what I can't do.

17:50.539 --> 17:55.876
I cannot live in a state
where the flip-flop is the state shoe.

17:55.911 --> 17:58.796
And what's with the drumming everywhere?
All I hear is drumming.

17:58.881 --> 18:00.547
Well, probably because
of the drum circles.

18:00.583 --> 18:04.751
Mm.
Uh, Kelly Parsons?

18:04.804 --> 18:05.836
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:05.921 --> 18:09.256
I'm Detective Jane Rizzoli.
This is Dr. Maura Isles.

18:09.341 --> 18:11.341
She's gonna be helping us
with your brother's case.

18:11.427 --> 18:14.428
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

18:14.513 --> 18:16.897
You know, I stood right
here two years ago,

18:16.932 --> 18:18.348
convinced he'd jumped.

18:18.434 --> 18:22.620
All this time, he wasn't dead.

18:23.105 --> 18:26.156
I'm sorry. This ... 
This must be such a shock.

18:26.242 --> 18:28.909
We had a funeral for him and everything.

18:28.944 --> 18:32.279
[crying] Who fakes their death?

18:32.331 --> 18:36.166
That's crazy, right?
I mean, even in Roger's world.

18:36.252 --> 18:38.919
What do you mean, "in Roger's world"?

18:38.954 --> 18:43.006
Fast life.
The Hollywood scene, you know?

18:43.092 --> 18:47.845
Then his girlfriend O.D.'ed,
and suicide made sense...

18:47.930 --> 18:49.463
even if they never found a body.

18:49.548 --> 18:52.799
Do you think maybe there
was a part of this fast life

18:52.885 --> 18:54.301
that made him fake his death?

18:54.353 --> 18:57.971
Well, he was obviously
in too deep at the hotel,

18:58.057 --> 19:01.275
so maybe he thought it
was the only way out.

19:01.310 --> 19:04.228
- What hotel?
- Where he worked.

19:04.313 --> 19:07.147
For a guy named Alphonse.

19:07.199 --> 19:09.449
We don't have any
record of him at a hotel.

19:09.485 --> 19:12.421
It wasn't that kind of job.

19:20.412 --> 19:23.547
Okay, primer. 
What do you want us to know?

19:23.632 --> 19:26.166
Yeah, all I know is
cardiologist, patriots fan,

19:26.252 --> 19:29.219
- daughter Joann.
- And I'm not telling you anything.

19:29.305 --> 19:32.556
- I want your unbiased opinion.
- What, from him?

19:32.641 --> 19:33.840
[both laugh, doorbell rings]

19:33.893 --> 19:36.009
- Would you pour?
- Oh, there he is!

19:39.899 --> 19:42.349
- Ron Hanson.
- Vince Korsak.

19:42.434 --> 19:44.351
- Hey.
- How you doing?

19:44.403 --> 19:47.271
- Hey!
- Angela: Hi.

19:47.356 --> 19:49.189
Oh, they're beautiful.
Thank you.

19:49.241 --> 19:50.490
- Mwah.
- Mm.

19:50.526 --> 19:52.109
- You're welcome.
- Mm.

19:52.194 --> 19:55.028
So, come in and have a drink!

19:59.501 --> 20:02.286
- Hi.
- Hello.

20:07.877 --> 20:12.129
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Likewise.

20:12.214 --> 20:14.548
- You two know each other?
- What?

20:14.633 --> 20:15.432
Nope.

20:19.021 --> 20:22.522
The fact that you don't
know each other is my fault.

20:22.558 --> 20:26.610
I mean, this dinner is long overdue.

20:27.479 --> 20:28.458
- Wine?
- Wine.

- Yeah.
- I'm happy to spot you.

20:52.338 --> 20:55.088
Yeah, Maura, that's not the point.
This is my last card.

20:55.174 --> 20:56.423
I don't think this is a glitch.

20:56.475 --> 21:01.144
- I think somebody's got my information.
- The fire.

21:01.230 --> 21:03.063
Maybe your mail was compromised

21:03.098 --> 21:07.067
- when the building was evacuated.
- Yeah, maybe.

21:07.102 --> 21:09.603
It would explain all
the weird phone calls.

21:09.655 --> 21:12.105
You know what?
Nina's still at the office

21:12.157 --> 21:13.240
going through the flight manifests.

21:13.275 --> 21:16.193
- I'll see if she can check it out.
- Good idea.

21:16.278 --> 21:19.413
I mean, whoever is doing this
has access to my entire life,

21:19.448 --> 21:23.617
and I can't even buy myself a drink,
which is very overpriced.

21:23.669 --> 21:27.120
And, if I may, a little
heavy on the vermouth.

21:27.206 --> 21:30.007
- Yeah, I'm not really a bartender.
- Oh?

21:30.092 --> 21:31.425
I'm an actor.

21:31.460 --> 21:33.460
I just do this so I can
audition during the day.

21:33.545 --> 21:36.013
Oh.

21:36.098 --> 21:40.133
- This will cover you.
- Not in this place.

21:40.219 --> 21:42.135
Ask him. 
That's not gonna cover me here.

21:44.473 --> 21:47.557
No.

21:47.643 --> 21:49.443
Well, make it work.

21:49.478 --> 21:53.563
[deliberately]
I'm supposed to be a high roller.

21:53.649 --> 21:57.651
Don't blow my cover.

22:01.407 --> 22:04.541
[normal voice] Ooh, Mr. Franklin.

22:04.626 --> 22:06.159
- Good luck.
- Wait ... no, no, no.

22:06.245 --> 22:08.995
- I need you for this part.
- Oh, no. I'd rather call it a night.

22:09.081 --> 22:11.665
- And I don't want my martini.
- You don't have to have one.

22:11.750 --> 22:15.502
- Pull up a Science Journal on your phone.
- Okay. I can do that.

22:15.587 --> 22:17.387
I've got a critical
study on hanging cases

22:17.473 --> 22:20.390
- I've been dying to read.
- Fascinating. Put these on.

22:20.476 --> 22:22.392
- At night?
- Yes.

22:22.478 --> 22:24.177
Put those on, don't look up,

22:24.229 --> 22:26.563
and don't talk to anyone,
no matter what happens.

22:28.517 --> 22:29.850
Ow.

22:33.238 --> 22:34.438
Psst.

22:34.523 --> 22:37.190
Want to be an actor?

22:37.276 --> 22:41.661
She's very important.

22:42.915 --> 22:44.865
[clears throat]

22:44.917 --> 22:46.783
I can do an English accent,

22:46.869 --> 22:49.202
and I can do a Southern dialect,

22:49.288 --> 22:51.671
and ... and, um, I can juggle.

22:51.707 --> 22:54.841
Yeah, oh, good for you.

22:54.877 --> 22:57.210
Quickly, could you tell me
where I would find Alphonse?

22:57.296 --> 22:59.713
Oh, you can't miss him.

23:05.137 --> 23:06.353
- There?
- Mm-hmm.

23:06.388 --> 23:09.723
- Thank you.
- Mm.

23:09.808 --> 23:12.692
[chuckles] Well, whatever
you need, it's on me.

23:12.728 --> 23:14.277
Alphonse.

23:14.363 --> 23:15.612
- Darling.
- Hey.

23:15.697 --> 23:17.564
- Hi.
- Hello.

23:17.649 --> 23:19.699
- How are you?
- Good, good. How are you?

23:19.735 --> 23:20.734
- I'm good.
- Good.

23:20.819 --> 23:22.235
It's good to see you.

23:22.287 --> 23:24.070
Last time I was in here,
I had Marty with me.

23:24.156 --> 23:25.372
We barely got a chance to talk.

23:25.407 --> 23:26.540
- Yes. Yeah.
- Remember?

23:26.575 --> 23:28.492
- Oh, of course I do.
- I'm so sorry.

23:28.577 --> 23:30.627
You know what he's like before
he has a movie that comes out.

23:30.712 --> 23:32.379
Yes. [chuckles]

23:32.414 --> 23:34.247
Listen, I was wondering
if you could help me.

23:34.299 --> 23:36.466
Um, Marty's gonna be
in here tomorrow night,

23:36.552 --> 23:38.585
but this time, he's bringing her.

23:41.223 --> 23:45.559
- And she is?
- Still in rehab, according to the papers.

23:45.594 --> 23:47.144
But you and I both
know if we don't get her

23:47.229 --> 23:48.428
a bottle of vodka and an eight ball

23:48.480 --> 23:50.564
we're both gonna lose our jobs, so...

23:50.599 --> 23:52.682
the last time, I had
Roger help me with this,

23:52.768 --> 23:56.269
but I-I can't find him anywhere, so...

23:56.321 --> 23:58.087
Could you help me?

23:59.691 --> 24:02.909
Please. Please. Please, please.
[chuckles]

24:02.945 --> 24:04.244
Of course I can.

24:04.279 --> 24:05.495
[laughs]
Whatever you need.

24:05.581 --> 24:07.614
- Oh! Thank you!
- Oh, you're welcome.

24:07.699 --> 24:09.449
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

24:09.501 --> 24:12.018
I was so hoping you would say that.

24:19.976 --> 24:22.234
[disco music]

24:22.235 --> 24:25.286
This is ridiculous.
You tricked me.

24:25.372 --> 24:27.072
Yeah, well, I didn't
think you'd talk to me

24:27.157 --> 24:29.040
about a missing person who
technically never worked here.

24:29.076 --> 24:30.709
- You were right.
- But we know he did.

24:30.744 --> 24:33.211
And we know that you
buy off-book things

24:33.246 --> 24:35.080
for people who are willing to pay,

24:35.132 --> 24:37.482
so what was Roger's role?

24:43.223 --> 24:46.391
- She just won a Grammy.
- Focus, Alphonse.

24:46.426 --> 24:49.344
I have a few runners who
pick things up for guests ...

24:49.429 --> 24:52.680
women, pills, whatever they want, okay?

24:52.766 --> 24:55.266
- Roger ran the drugs.
- Who's your dealer?

24:55.352 --> 24:57.602
He's not my dealer, first of all.

24:57.687 --> 25:01.439
Okay, one phone call, and
this entire place gets raided.

25:01.525 --> 25:03.108
You want to lose your
liquor license tonight?

25:03.193 --> 25:06.384
Because that pop princess over there
looks like she's about 12.

25:08.532 --> 25:11.416
- Dealer's name is Lamar.
- Is Lamar the kind of guy

25:11.451 --> 25:14.202
- you'd fake your death to get away from?
- I don't know.

25:14.287 --> 25:16.004
I have these runners
so I can stay out of it.

25:16.089 --> 25:17.872
You got to do better than that.

25:19.760 --> 25:22.627
Roger really lost it
after his girlfriend O.D.'ed,

25:22.712 --> 25:25.463
so maybe he said the
wrong thing to Lamar...

25:25.549 --> 25:27.966
or tried to get out of the game,

25:28.051 --> 25:30.268
but we both know
that's not how it works.

25:30.903 --> 25:33.188
How do I find Lamar?

25:33.273 --> 25:36.641
He's probably on speed dial of
half the phones in this room.

25:45.082 --> 25:47.165
It was awful, Vince.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.617
I never sat through
such an awkward dinner.

25:49.703 --> 25:51.920
Yeah, Ron and Kiki were
avoiding each other all night.

25:52.005 --> 25:54.923
- Like exes.
- No.

25:55.008 --> 25:58.209
Look, I'm no detective, but I
know when two people have history.

25:58.261 --> 26:01.346
- It would explain a lot.
- Oh, it explains everything.

26:01.381 --> 26:03.014
That's why they didn't say anything.

26:03.050 --> 26:06.267
They didn't want it to be weird
that the person I'm with

26:06.353 --> 26:10.271
- and the person you're with used to be...
- With each other.

26:10.357 --> 26:12.607
[sighs loudly]

26:12.693 --> 26:14.893
Then again...

26:14.945 --> 26:16.444
Yeah, could be anything. 
No way to know.

26:16.530 --> 26:18.279
Well, that's why we have to ask them.

26:18.365 --> 26:21.616
- We do?
- Don't we?

26:24.404 --> 26:26.204
[music]

26:26.239 --> 26:30.575
<i>Lamar St. John, 28 ...
drug dealer to the stars.</i>

26:30.660 --> 26:34.245
- Oh, so he makes a good living.
- And he's well-connected, political.

26:34.331 --> 26:36.331
He's untouchable, and he knows it.

26:36.416 --> 26:39.050
Is that why he so readily
agreed to come talk to us?

26:39.086 --> 26:43.221
- Nothing sticks to this guy.
- [scoffs] We'll see about that.

26:48.645 --> 26:50.095
[door closes]

26:50.147 --> 26:51.479
How you been, Lamar?

26:51.565 --> 26:53.932
I can't complain,
though I can't stay long.

26:54.017 --> 26:55.683
I'm opening up a new
hookah bar in Westwood.

26:55.769 --> 26:58.436
- The traffic will get you.
- Don't I know it.

26:58.488 --> 27:00.438
The 405's a killer, even in a Bentley.

27:02.192 --> 27:03.742
Hello.

27:05.195 --> 27:06.528
New recruit?

27:06.613 --> 27:09.447
This is Detective Rizzoli, 
Boston homicide.

27:09.533 --> 27:11.082
She wanted to talk to
you about Roger Parsons.

27:11.918 --> 27:13.618
I barely knew him.

27:13.670 --> 27:16.087
You probably sold his girlfriend
the drugs that killed her.

27:16.123 --> 27:19.457
Oh, yeah?
She tell you that from beyond the grave?

27:19.543 --> 27:21.376
Roger was a mess after she died.

27:21.461 --> 27:24.462
- Maybe you thought he was a liability.
- So, what?

27:24.548 --> 27:27.432
- You think I pushed him off that pier?
- No.

27:27.467 --> 27:30.301
But I do think you're the type of person
who doesn't leave loose ends.

27:30.387 --> 27:34.639
- Roger didn't die that day.
- But he is dead now.

27:34.724 --> 27:38.977
- How'd you guess?
- And you're a Boston cop...

27:39.062 --> 27:42.530
which means the murder happened there.
Oh, come on, mama.

27:42.616 --> 27:44.732
Do I look like I got time to chase down 
some fool in Boston?

27:44.818 --> 27:46.235
And if Roger faked his own death

27:46.236 --> 27:49.320
just to get me off his back,
it worked.

27:49.406 --> 27:51.406
I haven't thought about
that fool in two years.

27:51.491 --> 27:54.793
And as long as he stays dead,
I ain't got no issue with him.

27:54.828 --> 27:59.798
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really
do have to get ahead of traffic.

28:09.676 --> 28:14.012
I hate L.A. drug dealers more
than I hate Boston drug dealers.

28:14.064 --> 28:15.480
He's got a point, though.

28:15.515 --> 28:18.600
Yeah, if this isn't
about some old grudge

28:18.685 --> 28:20.518
catching up to Roger, well,
then we're not gonna solve it

28:20.604 --> 28:22.353
without connecting him to Dan Walsh.

28:22.439 --> 28:25.740
- Which we haven't done yet.
- We will. [cellphone buzzes]

28:28.411 --> 28:30.028
[cellphone beeps]

28:30.113 --> 28:33.248
- Hey, Nina. What's up?
- It's not good news.

28:33.333 --> 28:35.033
Your credit cards are just
the tip of the iceberg.

28:35.085 --> 28:36.167
You've been hacked.

28:36.903 --> 28:41.456
- Well, did they clean me out?
- No, which is the weird part.

28:41.541 --> 28:44.542
Your accounts haven't been overdrawn.
They were simply canceled.

28:44.628 --> 28:47.712
<i>- Same with your bank account.
- Jane: Canceled? [sighs]</i>

28:47.797 --> 28:49.797
Doesn't somebody have
to do that personally?

28:49.883 --> 28:51.599
Someone with a way to verify identity

28:51.685 --> 28:54.719
and answer your security questions.
This hacker is in deep.

28:54.804 --> 29:00.275
- O-Okay, so, what do I do?
- I'm sending you some documents to sign

29:00.360 --> 29:02.560
in order to open up an
official investigation.

29:02.612 --> 29:04.529
And I'm working with the
banks to trace the I.P. address

29:04.564 --> 29:07.115
of whoever accessed your accounts
since your apartment fire.

29:07.200 --> 29:10.118
Don't worry, Janie.
This is a high priority over here.

29:10.203 --> 29:12.654
We're gonna find out who's
behind it and shut it down.

29:12.739 --> 29:16.324
Okay, thanks, guys.
[cellphone beeps]

29:16.409 --> 29:20.211
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, it's all good.

29:32.264 --> 29:34.764
So, Parsons did fake his death
to escape his troubled life.

29:34.816 --> 29:39.235
<i>- Yes. Which worked.
- If Walsh's body hadn't have turned up,</i>

29:39.271 --> 29:43.856
- Parsons would probably still be alive.
- Right. So Parsons was killed

29:43.942 --> 29:46.276
because somebody knew that
he was living as Walsh.

29:46.328 --> 29:49.112
<i>Korsak: And didn't want
us to find out about it.</i>

29:49.197 --> 29:51.614
We're back to trying to find the
connection between these guys.

29:51.666 --> 29:53.533
<i>Nina: Which brings me
to the flight manifests.</i>

29:53.618 --> 29:55.285
Right.

29:55.337 --> 29:57.620
<i>Nina: We're looking at a
passenger named Dustin Shaw.</i>

29:57.706 --> 30:01.124
<i>He flew from L.A. to Boston and back
within one day of Roger's death,</i>

30:01.209 --> 30:02.792
and the address he states on his I.D.

30:02.877 --> 30:04.927
is a post office box
in Venice, California.

30:04.963 --> 30:07.797
- Maybe the P.O. Box means he was
 homeless like Walsh.  - Mm-hmm.

30:07.882 --> 30:10.433
There's something else you
need to know about Dustin Shaw.

30:10.468 --> 30:12.435
He's dead.
Nine months ago.

30:12.470 --> 30:15.555
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
according to the coroner's report.

30:15.640 --> 30:17.807
So we've got another
homeless man who's dead

30:17.892 --> 30:19.309
whose identity has been stolen.

30:19.394 --> 30:22.562
Somebody killing homeless people?
Selling their identities?

30:22.647 --> 30:24.614
Cardiomyopathy is a genetic condition,

30:24.649 --> 30:26.816
so technically, he
died of natural causes.

30:26.901 --> 30:29.619
Well, technically,
Parsons died of suicide.

30:29.654 --> 30:32.322
- We have to find the guy living 
as Dustin Shaw.  - Yeah.

30:32.374 --> 30:33.706
<i>Korsak: We need to
know what he looks like</i>

30:33.792 --> 30:35.541
<i>before we can put a BOLO out on him.</i>

30:35.627 --> 30:37.460
<i>I'm working with TSA to get
airport security footage.</i>

30:37.495 --> 30:40.630
Okay, thanks. In the
meantime, we'll go to Venice.

30:43.668 --> 30:46.502
[electric guitar playing]

30:50.308 --> 30:53.926
<i>- Hey. Have you seen these two?
- Oscar: Excuse me.</i>

30:54.012 --> 30:55.478
<i>Okay, thanks.</i>

30:55.513 --> 30:57.013
<i>Seen either one of
these two gentlemen here?</i>

30:57.098 --> 31:00.933
<i>- No, I haven't seen them.
- Okay, thanks.</i>

31:01.019 --> 31:03.019
<i>- Excuse me. 
- You recognize these two?</i>

31:03.104 --> 31:04.570
<i>Have you seen either one of these guys?</i>

31:04.656 --> 31:06.522
<i>- Okay, thanks.
- You sure?</i>

31:08.026 --> 31:10.910
Excuse me.
Do you recognize these two?

31:12.414 --> 31:13.996
<i>Have you seen either
one of these gentlemen?</i>

31:14.032 --> 31:17.583
<i>- One of these two?
- Okay, thanks.</i>

31:17.669 --> 31:19.419
[sighs]

31:19.504 --> 31:21.504
$1 apiece. [chuckles]

31:21.539 --> 31:25.792
- Do you recognize these two?
- Should I?

31:25.877 --> 31:29.379
Well, they were regulars at the
boardwalk shelter down the block.

31:29.464 --> 31:31.464
Well, if that's true, then
they were probably also regulars

31:31.549 --> 31:34.283
- at the Sand Dollar.
- Is that a bar?

31:34.352 --> 31:35.768
Yeah, all the bums go there.

31:35.854 --> 31:37.804
The bartender cashes
social security checks.

31:37.889 --> 31:39.939
He'll even let you take
a shower there sometimes.

31:40.024 --> 31:42.775
- All right, thanks.
- Here.

31:42.861 --> 31:46.279
On the house.
A souvenir of your trip.

31:46.364 --> 31:49.031
It's that obvious I'm
not from here, huh?

31:49.067 --> 31:51.868
Most people aren't from here.
Even me.

31:51.903 --> 31:53.569
But I can't leave.

31:53.621 --> 31:56.038
I mean, who wouldn't want
to call this home, huh?

31:56.074 --> 31:58.574
I don't know that this place could
ever feel like home to me. [chuckles]

31:58.660 --> 32:01.878
Spoken like a woman who has
family she actually likes.

32:02.313 --> 32:03.913
Try to let it grow on you.

32:03.998 --> 32:06.916
We aren't all weirdos here.
[chuckles]

32:07.001 --> 32:08.418
Thank you.

32:11.806 --> 32:14.807
[music]

32:14.893 --> 32:17.643
Hmm.
I-I don't know about him,

32:17.729 --> 32:18.761
but I do recognize this guy.

32:18.813 --> 32:20.730
- He a customer?
- No.

32:20.765 --> 32:22.432
There was another guy who
came in last week or so

32:22.484 --> 32:24.901
asking about him.
He said to call if he came by.

32:24.936 --> 32:30.773
- You get a name?
- Uh, I think he left his card.

32:30.859 --> 32:32.859
How many years you
say you've worked here?

32:32.944 --> 32:36.746
Uh, two or three years.
Not exactly the American dream.

32:36.781 --> 32:39.749
These guys have nowhere else to go.
I try to help them out.

32:39.784 --> 32:43.002
Is that what they call it ... 
"helping them out?"

32:43.087 --> 32:44.720
This is it.

32:47.876 --> 32:49.542
Okay, great. Thanks a lot.

32:53.765 --> 32:55.765
[music]

32:55.800 --> 32:58.050
How do you want to do this?
You want to question him together?

32:58.136 --> 32:59.352
No, no, no. It's your turf.

32:59.437 --> 33:02.104
- You take the first crack.
- You sure?

33:02.140 --> 33:04.974
Yeah. [cellphone buzzes]
I mean, I'll file for extradition

33:05.059 --> 33:06.392
as soon as I get home,
but if he did both murders,

33:06.478 --> 33:07.777
he's going down on both coasts.

33:07.812 --> 33:10.646
- Hey, Nina, what do you got?
- Homeland security footage just came in

33:10.698 --> 33:13.983
of the man traveling as Dustin Shaw.
No facial recognition yet,

33:14.068 --> 33:15.818
<i>but I just wanted you to
see who you're looking for.</i>

33:15.904 --> 33:17.987
Okay, thanks. Let me
know when you get a name.

33:18.039 --> 33:19.071
[cellphone beeps]

33:25.046 --> 33:27.497
We're in the wrong place.
The bartender is Dustin Shaw!

33:27.582 --> 33:30.500
Code 3 
at 690 North Venice Boulevard.

33:32.837 --> 33:35.054
[engine turns over, siren chirps]

33:35.139 --> 33:37.006
[siren wailing]

33:38.927 --> 33:40.927
Hands up. Everybody.

33:41.012 --> 33:42.395
[indistinct conversations]

33:42.480 --> 33:44.730
- Come on. Get them up.
- Dustin Shaw!

33:44.816 --> 33:47.767
L.A.P.D. 
Come out with your hands up.

33:57.111 --> 33:59.862
He's shredding the evidence.

33:59.914 --> 34:04.083
Well, he's trying to.
It's still on.

34:05.620 --> 34:07.703
He was just here.

34:20.885 --> 34:23.768
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,
mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

34:32.112 --> 34:33.478
- Move, move.
- Oscar: Move, move!

34:33.565 --> 34:34.730
Move, move, move!

34:34.815 --> 34:36.899
L.A.P.D. 
Move!

34:40.989 --> 34:42.572
- You okay? Don't move.
- Yeah.

34:44.208 --> 34:46.492
[applause]

34:46.578 --> 34:48.911
<i>Both hands behind your back.
[camera shutters clicking]</i>

34:49.998 --> 34:51.964
- Uh...
- Nice work.

34:52.050 --> 34:54.884
Thanks. Is this a problem?

34:54.918 --> 34:57.803
[laughs] No.
Happens all the time.

34:57.889 --> 35:00.006
- On your knees. Let's go.
- Really?

35:00.091 --> 35:02.642
Oh, yeah.
Our department is totally viral.

35:02.727 --> 35:05.428
Okay, where I come
from, this is a problem.

35:05.480 --> 35:08.681
- Come on.
- Okay, wh...

35:08.766 --> 35:11.017
- This is a problem! Okay?
- Hey!

35:11.102 --> 35:12.184
This is ... this is a big pr...

35:12.270 --> 35:14.687
You're a problem, you're a ...
What are you doing?

35:14.772 --> 35:17.857
Go! Go!
This is a problem!

35:27.549 --> 35:30.416
All these I.D.s are names
of regulars in the bar.

35:30.502 --> 35:32.502
Yeah, people who
probably wouldn't notice

35:32.554 --> 35:34.387
if somebody opened
a credit card in their name.

35:34.472 --> 35:37.173
The guys we talked to
said that the bartender,

35:37.225 --> 35:40.426
A.K.A. Dustin Shaw, let them
use the bar as a mailing address

35:40.512 --> 35:42.178
so they had a place to
receive their checks ...

35:42.230 --> 35:44.681
disability, social security.

35:44.766 --> 35:47.016
Well, I'll bet he
enjoyed cashing them, too.

35:47.102 --> 35:50.286
- For a fee.
- He skimmed thousands off these guys,

35:50.355 --> 35:53.273
not to mention the money
he made selling their I.D.s.

35:53.358 --> 35:56.459
Well, it seems like a good side gig.

35:56.528 --> 36:00.280
You know, Walsh must have caught on.
Some of the guys we talked to

36:00.365 --> 36:01.698
said they'd had suspicions
about the check-cashing,

36:01.783 --> 36:03.533
but they're transients, addicts.

36:03.585 --> 36:05.168
They didn't want to confront him.

36:05.203 --> 36:07.420
Yeah, and lose what little they had.

36:07.505 --> 36:11.291
- Okay, well, what made Walsh different?
- His hair.

36:11.376 --> 36:15.029
- His hair.
- Our analysis revealed a vitamin

36:15.030 --> 36:16.763
deficiency in the older growth.

36:16.848 --> 36:19.549
Consistent with advanced
alcoholism or substance abuse.

36:19.634 --> 36:22.302
But the newer growth
closer to the scalp ...

36:22.387 --> 36:26.105
- the deficiency was not present.
- So he got sober.

36:26.191 --> 36:28.391
And he must have realized
what Shaw was doing

36:28.443 --> 36:30.226
and threatened to expose him,

36:30.278 --> 36:34.230
and in or around that same time,

36:34.316 --> 36:37.734
Parsons is in dire
need of a fresh start,

36:37.786 --> 36:41.454
so Shaw kills Walsh,
sells his I.D. to Parsons,

36:41.539 --> 36:43.740
and then everything's
back to business as usual.

36:43.825 --> 36:47.410
- Until they found Walsh's body.
- Right.

36:47.462 --> 36:49.545
And Shaw knew that the
body would lead to Parsons,

36:49.581 --> 36:52.799
so he flew to Boston and
took him out. [chuckles]

36:52.884 --> 36:54.584
You two are like a regular
Cagney and Lacey.

36:54.669 --> 36:55.585
Thanks.

36:55.670 --> 36:58.221
- Thank you.
- Well...

36:58.256 --> 37:01.224
- What?
- It's factually inaccurate.

37:01.259 --> 37:03.142
Cagney and Lacey were
both police officers.

37:03.228 --> 37:06.262
Dr. Isles is a... medical examiner.

37:06.348 --> 37:09.232
Thank you.

37:09.267 --> 37:10.850
It's been very nice
working with you, detective.

37:10.936 --> 37:12.518
You too.

37:12.604 --> 37:15.855
Do you ladies think that
you'll be back again soon?

37:15.941 --> 37:17.774
When Malibu freezes over.

37:17.826 --> 37:22.244
Malibu received .3
inches of snow in 2007.

37:22.279 --> 37:24.619
It's not happening.

37:28.089 --> 37:31.924
[sighs]

37:33.628 --> 37:36.796
Okay, so, there's no point
in dancing around the subject.

37:36.848 --> 37:39.348
Vince and I asked you to come here

37:39.434 --> 37:41.634
because we wanted to clear the air.

37:41.719 --> 37:46.386
There is something the two
of you aren't telling us.

37:47.392 --> 37:49.392
You're right. There is.

37:49.477 --> 37:51.811
And in most cases, I'm a big advocate

37:51.863 --> 37:54.647
- of confronting things head-on.
- Good.

37:54.732 --> 38:00.319
- But in this particular case ...
- It's okay. They deserve to know.

38:00.405 --> 38:01.871
[breathes deeply]

38:02.076 --> 38:06.332
Uh, Ron and I dated.
In the past.

38:07.498 --> 38:09.865
- I knew it.
- Was it serious?

38:09.951 --> 38:14.537
- It was just one date, and it went...
- Badly.

38:14.622 --> 38:18.591
Uh, during the date,
Ron was suddenly struck

38:18.626 --> 38:23.045
with an extremely violent case of, um...

38:23.131 --> 38:26.179
Acute gastroenteritis.

38:26.718 --> 38:30.853
- Isn't that...
- Diarrhea. I had diarrhea.

38:30.938 --> 38:32.805
- Oh.
- Oh.

38:32.857 --> 38:34.473
Yeah.

38:34.525 --> 38:37.143
He was, uh, trapped in the
bathroom the whole night,

38:37.228 --> 38:39.278
and I felt it would be
rude to leave him there,

38:39.314 --> 38:42.531
though, in retrospect, with all I heard

38:42.617 --> 38:45.896
[laughing]
I desperately wish I had.

38:45.931 --> 38:48.988
- [laughter] That makes two of us.
- You poor bastard.

38:49.040 --> 38:51.240
I'm getting some drinks.
[laughing]

38:51.326 --> 38:55.244
- Oh, Ron. You poor guy.
- I'll join you.

38:55.330 --> 38:59.298
- Okay, that's funny.
- I am so sorry, Angela.

38:59.334 --> 39:02.001
I just didn't want to embarrass anyone,

39:02.086 --> 39:03.669
and I didn't want you to
think differently of Ron

39:03.721 --> 39:06.138
- because of this story.
- No, no, it's okay.

39:06.174 --> 39:10.593
I'm just really glad to
know he's human. [both laugh]

39:10.848 --> 39:13.933
[music]

39:20.525 --> 39:23.859
So, the bartender was not Dustin Shaw.

39:23.911 --> 39:26.362
Right.
He was just living as Dustin Shaw.

39:26.414 --> 39:28.697
His real name was Michael something.

39:28.749 --> 39:30.670
So no one is who they say they are.

39:30.705 --> 39:34.036
- Welcome to Los Angeles.
- Oh, come on.

39:34.121 --> 39:35.921
- It hasn't grown on you just a little bit?
- God, no.

39:36.007 --> 39:38.874
I've never wanted to see a duck
boat so badly in all my life.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.209
Well, I find it very relaxing.

39:40.294 --> 39:41.877
My low back pain is completely gone.

39:41.963 --> 39:43.879
- Coincidence.
- No.

39:43.931 --> 39:46.966
You find it so hard to
imagine yourself living here?

39:47.051 --> 39:49.629
[monkey chattering]

39:51.055 --> 39:52.721
[screeching]

39:52.807 --> 39:54.223
Hello.

39:55.943 --> 39:57.476
Really?

39:57.562 --> 40:01.146
You want to be attacked
by a monkey in a bikini?

40:01.232 --> 40:06.151
- At least he's not wearing flip-flops.
- I think it's a capuchin.

40:14.545 --> 40:18.163
- Hey! Welcome home.
- Hey.

40:18.249 --> 40:21.083
And she has returned from
the land of sun and sand.

40:21.135 --> 40:22.968
- And wine.
- Indeed.

40:23.054 --> 40:25.054
Very serious about their
wine, those Californians.

40:25.089 --> 40:26.805
- Thank you.
- Mm, enjoy.

40:26.891 --> 40:28.474
Be glad you didn't have to go
all the way there to get it.

40:28.559 --> 40:31.427
You are not allowed to take
a paid vacation to California

40:31.479 --> 40:32.928
and then complain about it.

40:32.980 --> 40:34.980
- Do you want your souvenir or not?
- Is it wine?

40:35.066 --> 40:36.348
I want it if it's wine.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.435
- Mister Juicy?
- Mm-hmm. If you ever wanted

40:39.487 --> 40:42.354
to feel like you were in L.A.,
look no further.

40:43.491 --> 40:46.358
- Now cleanse.
- Cleanse what?

40:46.444 --> 40:48.410
Just... cleanse.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.030
- Jane.
- Yeah?

40:51.115 --> 40:53.209
There's something you need to see.

40:54.035 --> 40:56.418
I traced the origins of
the hack into your accounts

40:56.454 --> 40:58.454
- to a specific I.P. address.
- Mm-hmm.

40:58.506 --> 41:01.123
It took me and three encryption
experts from the bank to do it.

41:01.175 --> 41:04.343
When I zeroed in on the address,
it tripped some mechanism

41:04.428 --> 41:06.462
that redirected me to
an unindexed website

41:06.514 --> 41:08.464
that you can't access
without a password.

41:08.549 --> 41:11.300
- Well, can we crack it?
- The password is Jane Rizzoli.

41:11.385 --> 41:14.186
The web address contained
a compressed video file,

41:14.271 --> 41:16.305
which I downloaded.
[computer beeps]

41:18.275 --> 41:22.394
- That's my apartment.
- From before the fire.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.880
Wait a minute. What is this?

41:29.487 --> 41:33.539
- It wasn't an accident.
- Why send a video?

41:33.624 --> 41:37.406
- 'Cause whoever set the fire...
- Wants me to know about it.
