00:06.005 --> 00:07.047
Kate: Previously on
"Workin' Moms".

00:07.047 --> 00:08.963
- We have let this go
long enough.

00:08.963 --> 00:11.880
We need to, like,
hug and communicate.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.838
- Did Anne give you more drugs?

00:13.838 --> 00:16.088
- Did you or did you not
want me to come onto you?

00:16.088 --> 00:18.422
- Marvin this was just some
harmless office flirting.

00:18.422 --> 00:20.338
Get a hold of yourself.

00:20.338 --> 00:21.963
Anne: My Nanny has bonded
with my daughter

00:21.963 --> 00:24.797
more in a week than
I have in nine years.

00:24.797 --> 00:26.963
- So, you in, Kate?

00:26.963 --> 00:28.922
- Let the best man win.

00:28.922 --> 00:30.630
- Your words not mine, man.

00:34.213 --> 00:35.713
(Baby coos)

00:37.713 --> 00:40.838
- Something I like to do
is just a gentle bicycle

00:40.838 --> 00:42.463
with the legs.

00:42.463 --> 00:44.797
And not only does
this feel dynamite

00:44.797 --> 00:46.588
in their little quads
and hammies,

00:46.588 --> 00:49.713
but it also helps them
to release gas. (Baby farts)

00:49.713 --> 00:51.755
- Speaking of massage;
Kate what's going on here?

00:51.755 --> 00:53.213
Kate: Oh, that?

00:53.213 --> 00:55.672
That's just the most amazing
rub down I've ever had.

00:55.672 --> 00:57.588
- I can't even imagine.

00:57.588 --> 00:59.297
- What, you've never had
a massage before?

00:59.297 --> 01:00.797
- I mean, not in years.

01:00.797 --> 01:02.463
I, uh... I don't think I could
enjoy it anymore

01:02.463 --> 01:04.213
because I am just
too preoccupied.

01:04.213 --> 01:06.547
- With what?
Boiling your diva cup?

01:06.547 --> 01:09.380
- Okay, take your thumbs
and trace little circ--

01:09.380 --> 01:11.963
- No, Anne, with the fact that
I have so much to do everyday.

01:11.963 --> 01:14.047
You know, doing the laundry,
cleaning the house,

01:14.047 --> 01:15.547
making baby food.

01:15.547 --> 01:17.380
- See if you weren't making
baby food

01:17.380 --> 01:18.880
maybe you could go
for a massage.

01:18.880 --> 01:21.338
- Everyday I take, like,
20 minutes

01:21.338 --> 01:25.380
just to think or dance
or, I don't know,

01:25.380 --> 01:28.088
clean my cow figurines,
whatever. Something.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.797
- I tell my family
that I have IBS,

01:30.797 --> 01:34.172
so I can lock myself in the
bathroom and play Candy Crush.

01:34.172 --> 01:37.338
- Jenny, what is the filter
that you use in your selfies?

01:37.338 --> 01:38.755
- I don't use filters.

01:40.422 --> 01:41.463
- Really? Wow.

01:41.463 --> 01:42.505
- Well, I've made the conscious
choice

01:42.505 --> 01:44.088
not to be on social media.

01:44.088 --> 01:45.630
Anne: Oh, good for you, Sheila.

01:45.630 --> 01:47.922
All: (positive reactions)
Kate: Let's throw her a parade.

01:47.922 --> 01:49.755
♪♪♪

01:59.005 --> 02:00.130
- Will there just be one ball

02:00.130 --> 02:02.005
that all our parents
will share from?

02:02.005 --> 02:04.297
- What?
- Here, like this.

02:04.297 --> 02:06.088
- Ah, smaller. Hm-hmm.

02:06.088 --> 02:07.922
- All right what time are you
gonna be home tonight?

02:07.922 --> 02:11.505
- Uh, no later than four,
five, latest. I promise.

02:11.505 --> 02:12.838
- Well, you better be home
for dinner.

02:12.838 --> 02:14.380
The last time you left me alone
with your parents

02:14.380 --> 02:17.922
it was the worst.
- When I gave birth to Charlie?

02:17.922 --> 02:20.172
- The small talk
was excruciating.

02:20.172 --> 02:21.713
- Fair enough.

02:21.713 --> 02:23.713
- Remember when you told me to
throw out this box of junk?

02:23.713 --> 02:25.297
- I do, yeah.

02:25.297 --> 02:26.880
- Well, I didn't throw out this
box of junk.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.255
I hid it in the crawl space.

02:28.255 --> 02:29.672
- Oh, thanks for your constant
reminder

02:29.672 --> 02:31.547
that I married the right man.
- Did you ever!

02:31.547 --> 02:33.047
Guess how much my VHS copy

02:33.047 --> 02:34.505
of "Beauty and the Beast"
is worth?

02:34.505 --> 02:37.838
Uh, negative 10 cents?
- Uh, try positive $500.

02:37.838 --> 02:41.047
- What?! What kind of nutjob
pays $500 for VHS?

02:41.047 --> 02:43.463
Can you please take Jamye
with you?

02:43.463 --> 02:45.588
- Oh, uh, funny, you know,
studies have said

02:45.588 --> 02:47.880
that crying babies really muck
up a business transaction--

02:47.880 --> 02:49.463
- Lionel!
- But I'm gonna take her

02:49.463 --> 02:51.797
'cause I love her
and I'm a good father. Yes.

02:51.797 --> 02:55.838
Let's go meet Herb.
Hopefully he's not a murderer.

02:55.838 --> 02:58.297
Yes. Yes.
Okay, bye, mommy.

02:59.963 --> 03:01.838
- Lionel?
- Yeah.

03:01.838 --> 03:03.505
- You will take her out
of the box

03:03.505 --> 03:05.880
and put her in the car-seat,
right?

03:05.880 --> 03:09.005
- Yeah.
(Door creaks open)

03:09.005 --> 03:10.380
- Where's Daddy going?

03:10.380 --> 03:13.880
- Jesus Christ, you scared me.
- Sorry for living.

03:13.880 --> 03:17.255
- Daddy and Jamye went to sell
junk to a man named Herb.

03:17.255 --> 03:18.547
- Gross.

03:18.547 --> 03:21.005
- So I guess it's just me
and you today.

03:21.005 --> 03:22.338
- Fun.

03:24.922 --> 03:25.838
(Apple crunches)

03:27.963 --> 03:31.630
- Looking good sugar butt.
- What are you doing?

03:31.630 --> 03:33.755
- C'mon don't worry,
I won't put it in.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.755
- Put what in what?

03:35.755 --> 03:38.797
- Your sweet ass in my
Kickstarter video.

03:38.797 --> 03:40.005
For my movie.

03:41.088 --> 03:44.838
- The movie about fat vampires?
(Blender whirs)

03:44.838 --> 03:48.172
- Did you listen
to anything I said?

03:48.172 --> 03:50.838
My new screenplay is about
stay at home dads.

03:50.838 --> 03:56.088
- Are the dads vampires?
- No. Also, not a bad idea.

03:56.088 --> 03:58.838
- I can't believe you're making
a Kickstarter.

03:58.838 --> 04:00.672
You really think people
are gonna give you money.

04:00.672 --> 04:03.380
- Yeah. You said you
were gonna help.

04:03.380 --> 04:05.297
- I was planning on going
to yoga.

04:05.297 --> 04:08.380
- You don't need yoga, baby,
if anything, yoga needs you.

04:09.630 --> 04:12.797
Come on, it'll be fun.
You, me, Zoe.

04:12.797 --> 04:14.713
- Fine I'll help you.

04:14.713 --> 04:17.172
You don't have to guilt me,
I'll do it.

04:17.172 --> 04:18.713
- All right!

04:18.713 --> 04:19.630
Zoe!

04:22.255 --> 04:24.297
(Phones ring)

04:27.713 --> 04:30.838
- Ugh, okay, I was test driving
the clients bike.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.963
It's a fixed gear bike.

04:32.963 --> 04:35.422
Did you know they
don't have brakes?

04:35.422 --> 04:37.297
- Yeah, Carl,

04:37.297 --> 04:39.463
everybody knows that
they don't have brakes.

04:39.463 --> 04:41.422
- Hey, you know what didn't
have breaks last night?

04:41.422 --> 04:43.672
- Uh-oh.
- This guy.

04:43.672 --> 04:46.463
Too bad I wasted it on a seven.
- Did you guys smash?

04:46.463 --> 04:49.297
- Chad could you refrain from
speaking millennial in here?

04:49.297 --> 04:51.380
- Come on, you guys
know what "smash" is.

04:51.380 --> 04:54.088
It's like tap that.
- You're talking about sex?

04:54.088 --> 04:57.547
- Yeah, just like, less sad.
- It sounds very violent.

04:57.547 --> 05:00.547
- What do you people call it?
- Sex. Mo?

05:00.547 --> 05:03.630
- I don't know. Guess I'd say,
uh, we banged.

05:03.630 --> 05:05.880
Got it on. Laid some pipe.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.297
- Like you could ever do
anything as masculine

05:08.297 --> 05:10.672
a plumbing.
(Chad laughs)

05:10.672 --> 05:13.880
Carl, what's your smash?
- Uh, make love.

05:13.880 --> 05:17.088
(All laugh)

05:17.088 --> 05:19.963
- As enlightening as this is,
let's, let's get down to work.

05:19.963 --> 05:21.838
- Agreed.
- Okay.

05:21.838 --> 05:24.130
Uh, Carl, So do you want my
specified notes right now?

05:24.130 --> 05:25.880
- Yes I do. Yeah.
- Chad, actually,

05:25.880 --> 05:27.672
you can hang onto those notes

05:27.672 --> 05:30.297
because you'll be making
the presentation.

05:30.297 --> 05:33.213
- Oh, I-I though I was?

05:33.213 --> 05:35.505
- Yeah. Uh, Carl, seeing
as you broke your face

05:35.505 --> 05:37.297
on the bike last night,

05:37.297 --> 05:39.588
I'm gonna keep you away
from the clients.

05:39.588 --> 05:42.463
- Yeah, so, uh...
I don't know about that,

05:42.463 --> 05:44.922
I've never pitched before.

05:44.922 --> 05:46.672
- You can handle it, man.

05:46.672 --> 05:49.213
- Yeah, man,
you're gonna smash it.

05:50.213 --> 05:51.588
(Door creaks open)

05:53.922 --> 05:57.838
(Car door opens)
- Please, come into my office.

05:59.297 --> 06:00.630
(Car door shuts)

06:00.630 --> 06:02.713
Can I offer you a refreshment?

06:02.713 --> 06:04.713
Look, I got chips, gum,

06:06.213 --> 06:09.630
I'm pretty sure this is a juice.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.922
You clearly love that place.

06:11.922 --> 06:14.963
If you wanna make a move, Nora,
this is the time.

06:14.963 --> 06:17.755
- I just, I feel rushed.

06:17.755 --> 06:19.505
- Mm-mm, no. We keep coming
back here, right?

06:19.505 --> 06:20.922
That means something.

06:20.922 --> 06:24.672
Seventh times a charm, right?
- I don't know.

06:24.672 --> 06:26.463
- Is this gum's cinnamon?
- Hm-hmm.

06:26.463 --> 06:28.213
- It's burning my mouth.

06:28.213 --> 06:31.047
- Is your body trying
to tell you something?

06:31.047 --> 06:33.713
You ready to make a move?
Hm-hmm.

06:36.505 --> 06:38.422
- 'Kay.
- Uh-ha.

06:38.422 --> 06:40.588
- I'll do it. Put in my offer.

06:40.588 --> 06:43.297
- Woo-yeah, come on,
let's do this.

06:43.297 --> 06:45.547
All right. Okay. Hold please.

06:45.547 --> 06:48.338
(Laughs, keys tap)
And it is sent.

06:49.713 --> 06:52.088

- Don't. Don't do that.

06:52.088 --> 06:54.463
You are gonna thrive here,
Nora.

06:54.463 --> 06:55.963
- You're right.

06:55.963 --> 06:58.130
- Yeah. This is gonna mean good
things for you.

06:58.130 --> 07:00.130

07:00.130 --> 07:02.422

07:02.422 --> 07:04.797
- What?! Oh-no, oh-no, oh-no.

07:05.963 --> 07:08.213
- Look, can I be real with you?

07:08.213 --> 07:11.130
Never saw you in that house.
- What?!

07:11.130 --> 07:15.463
- No, you, you think that you
think inside the box,

07:17.088 --> 07:21.255
but I think that you think
outside the box.

07:21.255 --> 07:23.755
Listen, got a little gem that
I've had in my back pocket

07:23.755 --> 07:27.380
for a few months now.
Don't tell anybody.

07:27.380 --> 07:31.213
Want to see the little gem
that's in my back pocket?

07:31.213 --> 07:32.922
It's a gem.

07:32.922 --> 07:34.588
- I don't mind seeing the gem
in your back pocket.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.588

Let's blow this joint.

Meany Corn is coming.

07:48.005 --> 07:51.588
Quick, we've gotta get out

Hi, I am Ian Mathews,

Every morning I wake up and I

you got this.

08:51.547 --> 08:54.213

09:00.255 --> 09:03.130
- You sound like a little
bitch. Confidence.

09:03.130 --> 09:05.463
- It's important to note

09:05.463 --> 09:06.838
when you're riding
through the city

09:06.838 --> 09:09.005
to be aware of the urban
environment.

09:09.005 --> 09:12.463
That-that's why we've planned
a series of bike riding--

09:12.463 --> 09:14.338
- Dude, they know this already.

09:14.338 --> 09:16.963
This is not how you
get it in with a client.

09:16.963 --> 09:19.297

okay? I'm teasing the tip.

09:19.297 --> 09:20.922
- Oh.
- It's Saturday.

09:20.922 --> 09:22.922
We all have better things to do
than watch you tease the tip.

09:22.922 --> 09:24.588

Why don't you just do it?

09:24.588 --> 09:26.422
- Yeah. All right. Thank you.

09:26.422 --> 09:28.422
- Will you give the kid
a chance, please?

09:28.422 --> 09:31.130
- Chad, you're gonna do great.

09:31.130 --> 09:33.547
Uh, just think of the client
as a buddy,

09:33.547 --> 09:35.213

with the buddy--

09:35.213 --> 09:37.630

looks like roadkill?

09:37.630 --> 09:39.505
You're giving advice on
pitching to a client?

09:39.505 --> 09:41.463
- Yeah, I thought it might
be a bit more helpful

09:41.463 --> 09:43.797

- I doubt it.

You pitch like you have sex;
badly and never.

09:46.005 --> 09:48.338
- Mo.
- Nice.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.713
(Everyone groans)

09:49.713 --> 09:52.005
- Oh God, this is glandular.
This is a real problem.

09:52.005 --> 09:54.297
- You look like a Manatee
at a wet t-shirt concert.

09:54.297 --> 09:56.088
- Look... forget this!

09:56.088 --> 09:57.672
- (Laughs) Oh ho!

09:57.672 --> 10:00.880
Come on, Carl, relax.
- Carl, you okay?

10:00.880 --> 10:03.213
Mo, Jesus.

10:03.213 --> 10:06.422
Boy: (on TV) I'm scared.
Girl: (On TV) Well, I'm hungry.

10:06.422 --> 10:08.880
- Hey.

10:08.880 --> 10:12.380
So should I be Brave Corn...y?
Gravy Corn?

10:13.713 --> 10:16.880
(Anne whinnies)
- You wanna play?

10:16.880 --> 10:20.922
- Yeah, sure.
If you want me to we can...

10:20.922 --> 10:24.380
(Anne whinnies) Hey look,
I am here, let's play.

10:24.380 --> 10:26.005
- Can we just finish
this episode?

10:26.005 --> 10:28.088
-Yep, sure. Yep, that's fine.

10:28.088 --> 10:29.963
Boy: Okay, on the count
of three

10:29.963 --> 10:32.630
let's put our horns
together and sing.

10:32.630 --> 10:34.547
Boy and girl: One, two, three.

10:34.547 --> 10:37.213
- How's that a dungeon?

10:37.213 --> 10:38.963
- Uh, that's where Meany Corn
lives. In the clouds.

10:38.963 --> 10:40.505
He has them locked up.

10:40.505 --> 10:42.588
- You can't lock somebody
in a cloud.

10:42.588 --> 10:44.797
Clouds aren't solid,
you can walk through a cloud.

10:44.797 --> 10:46.922
You know that, right?

10:46.922 --> 10:49.088
Boy: Quick, give me a boost.
Girl: Well, climb on.

10:49.088 --> 10:51.880
- Why does she need a boost?
She's a horse, she can jump.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.380
- She's not a horse, Mom,
she's a unicorn.

10:54.380 --> 10:57.005
- Okay, so don't unicorns
have magical powers?

10:57.005 --> 10:59.213
I mean that skill set could
come in really handy--

10:59.213 --> 11:01.380
- Mom, if you don't like
the show

11:01.380 --> 11:04.172
then don't watch it with me.

11:04.172 --> 11:06.172
- Okay. God.

11:07.505 --> 11:10.505
(Clears throat)

11:10.505 --> 11:13.213
I'm just gonna excuse
myself then.

11:13.213 --> 11:15.547
I'll be right back.

11:15.547 --> 11:17.505
Boy: Don't forget the sugar
cubes!

11:17.505 --> 11:19.672
- So let me just make sure
to hit record.

11:19.672 --> 11:21.047
- What do you want me to say?

11:21.047 --> 11:22.880
- Just talk about how blessed
you feel

11:22.880 --> 11:25.297
being married to a stay
at home dad.

11:25.297 --> 11:28.172
- Right.
- Ready?

11:28.172 --> 11:31.005
(Record button beeps)
And action.

11:31.005 --> 11:32.630
- My name is Jenny Mathews.

11:32.630 --> 11:34.797
I'm married to a stay
at home dad.

11:37.213 --> 11:39.797
My husband stays at home
with our daughter

11:39.797 --> 11:43.713
and watches her grow
and I go to work, it's great.

11:43.713 --> 11:46.213
- Cut. Cut. Okay.

11:46.213 --> 11:48.088
Honey, I understand that
you're not a, you know,

11:48.088 --> 11:50.172
a natural performer,

11:50.172 --> 11:52.713
but it's starting to come off
a little sarcastic.

11:52.713 --> 11:55.422
- Uh-ha.
- Do you know what you need?

11:55.422 --> 11:57.797
A scene partner.

11:57.797 --> 12:01.005
Come on. And up.

12:01.005 --> 12:02.797
All right, let's try it again,

12:02.797 --> 12:06.797
except this time look deep
into Zoe's eyes

12:06.797 --> 12:10.713
and speak from the heart. Okay?

12:10.713 --> 12:12.838
Ready? And action.

12:16.255 --> 12:21.838
- My husband watches our
daughter and I go to work

12:23.463 --> 12:25.963
where I find myself feeling

12:25.963 --> 12:28.463
like I'm searching
for something,

12:28.463 --> 12:31.213
but I don't even know
what it is.

12:31.213 --> 12:34.588
I come home from work
to find my husband

12:34.588 --> 12:36.755
bonding with my daughter

12:36.755 --> 12:39.088
in ways I always imagined
I would bond with her

12:39.088 --> 12:41.838
and then I, I feel like--
- Cut. Cut.

12:41.838 --> 12:44.213
Okay. Um, Honey, no ones
is gonna want to donate

12:44.213 --> 12:45.963
if they're getting a negative
vibe, right?

12:45.963 --> 12:47.755
It's a little heavy.

12:47.755 --> 12:50.005
So why don't we make it a
little bit more about me.

12:50.005 --> 12:53.005
- Right. So, like, less honest.

12:53.005 --> 12:55.630
- Yes, exactly! Thank you.

12:56.922 --> 12:58.463
Okay, perfect.

12:58.463 --> 13:00.880
Let's record and... action.

13:02.130 --> 13:03.630
- (Exasperated breath)

13:03.630 --> 13:05.713
- Alice, come over here.

13:08.505 --> 13:11.505
(Paper crinkles,
footsteps thud)

13:13.172 --> 13:17.047
- Mom, why are you sick
all the time?

13:17.047 --> 13:19.672
- Uh, because I have perpetual
indigestion--

13:19.672 --> 13:21.505
it doesn't matter
just sit down.

13:21.505 --> 13:23.422
- But there is another episode.
- Sit.

13:23.422 --> 13:25.213
- (Irritated huff)

13:25.213 --> 13:27.755
- You see this?
- Yeah, I see it.

13:27.755 --> 13:29.880
- We're gonna make one
of these.

13:29.880 --> 13:31.672
- Why?
- What do you mean why?

13:31.672 --> 13:32.922
Because it's pretty.

13:32.922 --> 13:34.463
- Can we make a unicorn
instead?

13:34.463 --> 13:37.963
- No.
- Why not?

13:37.963 --> 13:40.047
- Because we're making a bird.

13:40.047 --> 13:43.963
And because I don't know
how to make a unicorn.

13:45.505 --> 13:48.755
Alice, come on, it'll be fun.

13:48.755 --> 13:51.880
...and so you fold it over
diagonally.

13:55.172 --> 13:57.880
Uh, no. Honey...

13:57.880 --> 14:00.422
Diagonally. The corners have
to meet up.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.130
- Like this?

14:02.130 --> 14:03.797
- No, the corners have
to be flush.

14:03.797 --> 14:06.005
- What's flush?
- It's when they line up.

14:06.005 --> 14:07.297
You have to pay attention
to detail.

14:07.297 --> 14:08.713
- I'm trying.
- Are you?

14:08.713 --> 14:10.130
Because if you're not gonna
do it right

14:10.130 --> 14:12.130
you might as well crumple up
your paper.

14:12.130 --> 14:15.130
- You mean like this?
(Paper crinkles)

14:15.130 --> 14:17.172
(Paper thuds)

14:21.922 --> 14:24.005
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

14:25.380 --> 14:28.088
- Congratulations Frankie.
- Put her there.

14:28.088 --> 14:31.047
- Wait, wait, you sold that
turd?

14:31.047 --> 14:34.588
- Hey, man, one persons turd
is another persons house.

14:34.588 --> 14:37.463
- Did she go inside?
- Did she smell the back room,

14:37.463 --> 14:39.713
I mean it smells like salmon.
- Guys, what I sold her

14:39.713 --> 14:43.297
was a new beginning.
A salmon scented new beginning.

14:43.297 --> 14:45.672
- Seriously, Frankie, good job.

14:45.672 --> 14:47.755
- You keep it up, you'll be
employee of the month.

14:47.755 --> 14:49.547
- We have employee of the month?

14:49.547 --> 14:51.588
- Oh, no. (Laughs)

14:51.588 --> 14:53.797
But if we did...

15:02.047 --> 15:03.797
- Hey G.
Giselle: Frankie,

15:03.797 --> 15:06.005
this isn't a good time.
- Yeah, I know you're busy,

15:06.005 --> 15:07.755
but I just want to call
and tell you that--

15:07.755 --> 15:09.630
Giselle: Okay, okay, Rhoda.
- I got some good news.

15:09.630 --> 15:12.797
- I've got to go.
- I sold the... house...

15:12.797 --> 15:15.255
What was that? She hung up.

15:15.255 --> 15:18.338
She's...she's kind of busy
right now.

15:18.338 --> 15:20.463
She's really happy for me
though.

15:20.463 --> 15:23.213
- We're happy for you too.
- Thanks.

15:24.213 --> 15:26.380
(Heavy exhale)

15:27.713 --> 15:29.463
(Phone buzzes)
- Hmm?

15:31.422 --> 15:33.630
Oh, fuck.

15:36.213 --> 15:38.047
(Sighs)

15:40.255 --> 15:42.172
Carl?

15:42.172 --> 15:45.005
- Kate. Hey. Hey, uh...
what's up?

15:46.505 --> 15:50.130
- Hey, man, look I'm sorry
about what Mo said in there.

15:50.130 --> 15:53.255
He was, he was being a jerk.

15:53.255 --> 15:55.380
- (Laughs) Yeah, no,
he just kinda poked

15:55.380 --> 15:57.630
a couple of my sore
spots there.

15:57.630 --> 15:59.588
- Like your face? (Laughs)
- Yeah.

15:59.588 --> 16:01.422
- Oh, don't... I'm sorry.

16:01.422 --> 16:03.005
I know you're going through
a divorce

16:03.005 --> 16:06.172
and that's gotta be hard.
- Oh, if you...

16:06.172 --> 16:08.880
if only that was it.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.713
I figured it was time
to move on,

16:11.713 --> 16:14.672
so I went online
and I fell in love.

16:15.755 --> 16:18.047
- Oh my God, Carl,
that's great.

16:18.047 --> 16:21.088
- No, no, that's not great,
Kate. I...

16:23.922 --> 16:24.922
I got catfished.

16:26.422 --> 16:27.838
- Oh no.

16:27.838 --> 16:30.088
- Yeah, it turns out this girl
named Tina

16:30.088 --> 16:33.422
is actually a guy named
Phoenix.

16:33.422 --> 16:36.422
- Well, that, that can happen
to anybody.

16:36.422 --> 16:39.672
It's like, I see something
and I wanna tell Tina,

16:39.672 --> 16:42.255
but hey, guess what, buddy?
You can't tell Tina,

16:42.255 --> 16:46.005
you can only tell Phoenix
because Tina doesn't exist.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.838
- Oh. Oh-no, eh,
oh God, it's okay.

16:48.838 --> 16:52.172
Oh no.
(Carl sobs)

16:52.172 --> 16:54.255
- Hey, Buddy, look,
for the record,

16:54.255 --> 16:58.672
I think you are a really sweet,
really smart guy.

17:00.255 --> 17:02.588
- Well, thanks, Kate.

17:02.588 --> 17:05.172
You know you're really good
at this job.

17:05.172 --> 17:06.755
- Thank you.

17:06.755 --> 17:11.130
- I don't know why they gave Mo
the Montreal gig.

18:52.338 --> 18:54.422
- Ah, just getting
some fresh air.

18:54.422 --> 18:56.588

18:56.588 --> 18:59.630
- (Grumbles) Vaping actually.

18:59.630 --> 19:01.588

19:01.588 --> 19:03.422

19:03.422 --> 19:06.255
- Yeah, I'm good.

19:07.755 --> 19:09.255
- Ooh.
- Mm?

19:09.255 --> 19:11.338
- You seem like you're down
in a trough.

19:11.338 --> 19:13.213
Care to share? What is it?

19:13.213 --> 19:15.922
- I'm, I'm just tired.
- Oh.

19:15.922 --> 19:18.380
Hey, what about the Montreal
thing, any word?

19:18.380 --> 19:20.588
- Actually, um...

19:20.588 --> 19:22.588
I just found out
they gave it to Mo.

19:22.588 --> 19:25.255
- The weeper?!
- No, that's Carl.

19:25.255 --> 19:27.588
- The teenage zorp?
- Dad, that's Chad.

19:27.588 --> 19:29.213
- Ridiculous.

19:29.213 --> 19:31.713
Why your boss would want so
many boys with the same name

19:31.713 --> 19:34.797
in that office, is beyond me.

19:34.797 --> 19:36.588
How'd he tell you?

19:36.588 --> 19:40.213
- Who, Richard? He didn't,
I found out from Carl.

19:40.213 --> 19:42.172
The Weeper.

19:42.172 --> 19:44.297
- Well, Don't un-count your
chickens

19:44.297 --> 19:46.130
before you know they're dead.

19:46.130 --> 19:48.630
Just wait 'till you hear it
directly from Richard.

19:48.630 --> 19:51.088
- Yeah, maybe.

19:51.088 --> 19:54.713
- And, Nathan, does he
know what's happening?

19:55.713 --> 19:58.172
Oh, you have to have
a talk with him.

19:58.172 --> 19:59.838
I mean, a real talk.

19:59.838 --> 20:01.713
Secrets in a marriage
are like fleas in a bed;

20:01.713 --> 20:04.005
you can leave them to fester,

20:04.005 --> 20:07.005
they'll both have you sleeping
on the couch.

20:07.005 --> 20:09.880
- Fair enough.

20:09.880 --> 20:11.547
- Oh, I better get back inside.

20:11.547 --> 20:13.088
I told your mom
I was making a call,

20:13.088 --> 20:16.130
but I just remembered
my phone's in her purse.

20:16.130 --> 20:18.922
- (Laughs)
Sounds like a secret.

20:18.922 --> 20:20.588
- Well, what do you want for
nothing.

20:20.588 --> 20:23.005
Just do as I say,
don't do as I do.

20:23.005 --> 20:24.838
- Okay.
- You coming?

20:26.005 --> 20:28.630
- In a minute. Will you pretend
you haven't seen me?

20:28.630 --> 20:31.463
