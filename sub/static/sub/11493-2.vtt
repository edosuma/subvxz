I don't want to be
involved in another one.

No.

cold and angry.

20:35.416 --> 20:37.033
Well, really uncomfortable

20:37.035 --> 20:38.167
living at my mom's.

20:38.169 --> 20:40.619
Um, do you think I could
stay here for a few days

20:40.621 --> 20:41.904
till I find my own place?

20:41.906 --> 20:43.172
No problem.

20:43.174 --> 20:45.074
Few days, couple weeks.

20:45.076 --> 20:46.092
Yeah, done.

20:46.094 --> 20:48.410
Month, tops.

20:48.412 --> 20:49.879
Whatever.

20:49.881 --> 20:51.246
Great, great. Thanks.

20:51.248 --> 20:52.631
And, uh, and don't worry,

20:52.633 --> 20:54.350
I'm not one
to overstay my welcome.

20:54.352 --> 20:55.551
Cool.

20:59.339 --> 21:00.673
I'm back.
