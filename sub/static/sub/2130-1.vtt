03:28.667 --> 03:30.044
Who are you?

03:32.463 --> 03:36.467
Prove to me you are one of us.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.267
My King.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.168
Come, baby brother.

04:31.063 --> 04:32.648
Baby brother.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.188
Tell him who you are.

19:32.589 --> 19:33.882
Onward!

19:34.215 --> 19:35.300
Onward!

21:49.559 --> 21:50.810
Praise the ancestors.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.312
Praise the ancestors.

24:58.414 --> 24:59.415
Onward!

29:35.024 --> 29:36.192
Praise the ancestors.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.199
Father.

31:07.575 --> 31:08.701
My son.

31:37.855 --> 31:40.858
What is wrong my son?

31:41.275 --> 31:43.611
I am not ready.

31:44.445 --> 31:46.781
Have you not prepared

31:46.947 --> 31:51.160
to be king your whole life?

31:51.577 --> 31:54.872
Have you not trained and studied,

31:55.206 --> 31:57.875
been by my side?

41:34.826 --> 41:36.495
Hello Sophia.

41:36.787 --> 41:38.997
Good to see you.

41:40.290 --> 41:41.875
Who are these two?

41:42.042 --> 41:46.630
My friends from Kenya.
Very deep pockets. They're good.

41:47.047 --> 41:49.508
Good for trouble...

41:49.675 --> 41:51.259
...like you?

42:00.102 --> 42:01.561
Thank you!

43:12.090 --> 43:13.550
Over here.

43:14.301 --> 43:16.136
One whiskey, please.

46:46.304 --> 46:47.430
Stand down!

46:51.476 --> 46:52.852
I've been made.

48:08.094 --> 48:09.637
Murderer!

53:33.211 --> 53:34.462
King!

53:35.088 --> 53:36.964
The world watches.

54:21.384 --> 54:25.179
We can't let him talk to Klaue alone.

54:28.224 --> 54:34.230
Better to let him talk to Klaue
alone for 5 minutes than to make a scene here.

54:50.163 --> 54:52.748
If he touches you again,

54:52.957 --> 54:55.668
I'm going to impale him to this desk.

58:17.370 --> 58:19.622
Where is that?

58:20.539 --> 58:22.375
Back there.

58:37.348 --> 58:38.849
Something is happening out back.

59:23.394 --> 59:24.562
My King!

59:27.857 --> 59:29.024
My King.

1:08:30.065 --> 1:08:32.317
Who are you?

1:13:23.483 --> 1:13:26.361
Tell us what is going on.

1:13:45.797 --> 1:13:46.840
Speak.

1:14:18.955 --> 1:14:20.165
My goodness.

1:15:39.911 --> 1:15:40.912
Who are you?

1:15:41.121 --> 1:15:45.375
I am N'Jadaka, son of Prince N'Jobu.

1:15:46.501 --> 1:15:47.544
Son of N'Jobu?

1:15:52.132 --> 1:15:53.258
You're lying!

1:16:00.348 --> 1:16:02.600
The descendent of N'Jobu.

1:22:40.248 --> 1:22:41.624
Thank you.

1:22:44.585 --> 1:22:46.212
I cannot

1:36:12.059 --> 1:36:13.393
Praise the ancestors.

1:36:13.560 --> 1:36:14.561
Praise the ancestors.

1:36:15.687 --> 1:36:17.147
Praise the ancestors.

1:36:18.190 --> 1:36:19.608
Praise the ancestors.

1:36:27.199 --> 1:36:28.533
My son.

1:36:51.390 --> 1:36:52.808
Why?

1:44:14.374 --> 1:44:15.417
Shields!

1:47:19.976 --> 1:47:21.227
Lock!

1:47:21.894 --> 1:47:23.021
Get him down!

1:47:23.813 --> 1:47:25.398
Get the necklace!

1:47:25.857 --> 1:47:27.442
Get the necklace!

1:54:12.930 --> 1:54:14.223
Charge!

2:13:49.647 --> 2:13:51.441
White Wolf!

2:13:52.734 --> 2:13:53.860
White Wolf!
