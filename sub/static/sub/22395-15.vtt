Donald, I thought we were supposed
to take him to his big job interview.

00:11.792 --> 00:13.458
We'll just have to wake him up.

00:13.792 --> 00:15.500
Goofy! Goofy!
Goofy!

00:16.291 --> 00:18.083
Wake up!

00:21.542 --> 00:24.500
What are we gonna do? It's
almost time for his interview.

00:36.250 --> 00:37.667
Mr. Goofy?

00:39.792 --> 00:41.542
Let's win the day for goofy.

00:46.792 --> 00:48.542
You must be goofy.

00:48.834 --> 00:50.542
Well, let's get this over with.

00:59.083 --> 01:00.542
Why don't you have a seat?

01:01.875 --> 01:04.208
Whoa. Ow.

01:07.667 --> 01:08.667
Whoa!

01:13.417 --> 01:17.375
So, what makes you think you're right
for this job at company industries, hmm?

01:17.625 --> 01:19.834
Wait, what kind of job
was he applying for?

01:19.834 --> 01:22.083
I don't know!
I never asked!

01:22.875 --> 01:24.417
Come now, speak up, man!

01:24.750 --> 01:27.125
I'm waiting!

01:27.625 --> 01:30.208
What do I say?
Just say anything.

01:31.500 --> 01:34.583
Mentor developed synergies?

01:34.750 --> 01:36.917
Hmm. Interesting.

01:36.917 --> 01:39.458
Qualified balanced skill-tactics.

01:39.458 --> 01:41.083
Ohhh! Not bad!

01:41.291 --> 01:43.500
Let me try one.

01:43.792 --> 01:45.750
Quack, quack, quack, quack.

01:45.750 --> 01:48.375
Bilingual? Always a plus.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.792
Now then, one final question...

01:55.250 --> 01:58.792
Oh, you're right,
these questions are boring.

01:58.792 --> 02:02.291
If only I could change them,
but dad made the rules.

02:02.834 --> 02:05.375
Oh well, like they say,
if you can't beat 'em,

02:05.375 --> 02:06.959
make sure your dad owns the company.

02:06.959 --> 02:08.834
Am I right?

02:09.291 --> 02:10.667
He told a joke.
Do something.

02:14.625 --> 02:18.667
Why don't you leave us your contact
information and we'll get back to you?

02:25.667 --> 02:27.583
Oh no, he's having a nightmare.

02:28.875 --> 02:29.917
Whoa...

02:39.625 --> 02:40.625
Ahhh!

02:43.875 --> 02:44.875
Papa.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.375
Look what you've done!

02:49.000 --> 02:50.875
You've freed me!

02:52.375 --> 02:53.417
- Huh?
- What?

02:53.417 --> 02:56.500
No more will I have my
father looking down at me.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.834
Now, I'm free to run the
company my own way.

03:02.500 --> 03:03.917
You're hired!

03:04.834 --> 03:08.250
We did it! Now we
can see what his job is!

03:16.250 --> 03:18.458
Ahhh!

03:20.458 --> 03:23.959
Why didn't you guys wake
me up? I'm late for my interview!

03:24.375 --> 03:25.375
Whoa!

03:26.041 --> 03:27.500
Goofy!
