JOHN: Freedom has been under
attack in every generation

01:17.777 --> 01:19.545
and our generation is no different.

01:19.546 --> 01:23.415
DIANA: Who better to ask about the
subject of freedom than you, John?

01:23.416 --> 01:27.853
You've been hailed as God's ambassador
by the world's foremost dictatorships,

01:27.854 --> 01:31.123
Sudan, North Korea and Iran.

01:31.124 --> 01:35.260
But there are those who claim
that your ministry is intolerant,

01:35.261 --> 01:39.098
that it's condescending
to people of other faith.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.133
Some in Washington have even said

01:41.134 --> 01:46.839
that your crusades may even
threaten the freedom of others.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.508
Diana, if I thought for a second

01:49.509 --> 01:53.982
that I could look down on anyone for
their beliefs, I wouldn't be sitting here.

I'm not a Republican,
I'm not a Democrat.

01:57.150 --> 02:00.831
I don't belong to any particular
religious denomination.

02:01.621 --> 02:05.427
And my personal history is no
better than any of your viewers'.

02:09.829 --> 02:14.306
You know what kind of person
I was, who I really was?

02:16.469 --> 02:18.409

02:22.442 --> 02:24.246

death when God came into my life.

02:30.583 --> 02:32.484
So, John, what is your opinion

02:32.485 --> 02:36.922
of the primary tenets of
the Faith and Fairness Act

02:36.923 --> 02:40.826

equal time and respect

02:48.368 --> 02:51.436
Freedom is fragile and costly

02:51.437 --> 02:55.118

by work and by faith.

He has had quite a past,

03:43.756 --> 03:48.627
I'm not going to get into that. That's
something that's water under the bridge

only guy I've ever known

Hey, John. How are we doing tonight?

04:33.973 --> 04:36.942
Yeah, well, I just want to say,
I saw your piece on "Prime Time."

04:36.943 --> 04:39.278
I thought it was very, very nice.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.289
The transparency was very moving.

04:42.915 --> 04:44.850
I know this isn't your
cup of tea, John.

04:44.851 --> 04:46.852
Then why do you keep pushing
when you already know my answer?

04:46.853 --> 04:50.289
I need your full support on
the Faith and Fairness bill.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.957
Now your ministry reaches more people

04:51.958 --> 04:55.894
than the "Evening News" and I need you
to get up there on national television

04:55.895 --> 04:58.930
and announce that you
fully support this bill.

Why don't you lead us, Ryan?

01:01:49.005 --> 01:01:50.877
Okay.

01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:54.710
Lord God, we are so thankful.

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:59.247
We are so grateful you allow
us to enter into your throne

01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:03.589
with all these blessings
you've given to us.

01:02:16.999 --> 01:02:21.203
Just be thankful that we
can allow these blessings

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:24.005
to just be distributed
throughout the earth

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:28.176
and these four walls might
make your name famous

01:02:28.177 --> 01:02:32.723

We are so thankful for

for your showers of mercy, Lord.

Why don't you have a seat, Ryan?

01:03:31.574 --> 01:03:33.141
Look, I don't know what to say.

01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:34.576
We hate seeing you like this.

but you can't just barge...

01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:43.087
I'm not going to ask you again, Ryan.

01:03:44.587 --> 01:03:48.996
Fine. Your show.

01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:38.573
Look at those numbers.

01:04:38.574 --> 01:04:42.077
Not bad for tax money,
for blood money.

01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:43.916
Was it worth it?

That's what, like...
help me out here, Dave,

you're the numbers guy.

01:04:57.627 --> 01:05:01.196
That's like, what,
a 200% increase in salary?

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:02.464
RYAN: John, be reasonable.

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:04.199
Reasonable?

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.269
Is that how you got to where you're
sitting today, by being reasonable?

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:11.640
John, your uncompromising
perspective is admirable.

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:13.275
I admire it.

01:05:13.276 --> 01:05:17.116
But your approach is not
always a practical one.

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:24.856
I built this place
with my bare hands.

01:05:26.188 --> 01:05:29.095
Now you're in bed
with the government.

01:05:29.525 --> 01:05:31.626
You're taking tax dollars
and you don't think

01:05:31.627 --> 01:05:35.240
that they can silence
you any time they want?

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:39.434
They've got a hook in your back.

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:42.726
And you don't even realize it
because you're too blinded

01:05:42.728 --> 01:05:45.607
by ambition, greed and lust.

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:48.677
John, it wasn't always
meant to be this way.

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:52.347
Obviously, what happened
to you is unthinkable.

01:05:52.348 --> 01:05:54.416
But as far as this
organization is concerned,

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:56.117
we're here just picking
up the pieces.

01:05:56.118 --> 01:06:00.231
You asked us to come
here for damage control.

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:17.739
So what good could it possibly do
if we blow our entire credibility

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:20.475
on one piece of legislation?

01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:24.279
We'd then just spend the rest of our
life wandering in the wilderness

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.181
without any credibility whatsoever.

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:29.419
How many people can
we approach that way?

01:06:32.221 --> 01:06:35.299
Have all of you completely forgotten?

01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:43.340
There was once a man

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:49.280
who wandered in the wilderness

01:06:50.606 --> 01:06:53.343
and he reached more people

01:06:54.377 --> 01:06:57.216
than you're ever going to reach now.

01:08:21.697 --> 01:08:24.599
I've got him. He's heading to the
southeast corner of the building
