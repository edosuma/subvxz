Previously on "The Originals"...

00:01.536 --> 00:02.668
You're Klaus' father?

00:02.670 --> 00:03.936
You can bring me back to life.

00:03.937 --> 00:05.638
Welcome to my hell.

00:05.640 --> 00:06.739
[Gasps]

00:06.741 --> 00:07.773
You're all right.

00:07.775 --> 00:09.074
Have you dreamt of our father?

00:09.076 --> 00:10.376
I saw Mikael.

00:10.378 --> 00:11.877
I've been dreaming of him, too.

00:11.879 --> 00:14.280
Your mother was clearly
a very gifted witch.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.781
Marcel: Any way I do the math,

00:15.783 --> 00:17.416
it ends with me and my guys dead,

00:17.418 --> 00:19.385
so whatever it is you got
coming with the wolves,

00:19.387 --> 00:22.288
just know that I will
fight until I am dead!

00:22.290 --> 00:23.622
Raaaah!

00:23.624 --> 00:25.090
Aah!

00:27.661 --> 00:28.861
Francesca: Nice job.

00:28.863 --> 00:30.029
You saved me the trouble

00:30.031 --> 00:32.898
of killing all these vampires myself.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.466
Aah!

00:34.468 --> 00:36.468
That baby is part witch.

00:36.470 --> 00:39.338
She has to be born first
before she can die.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.372
No!

00:40.374 --> 00:41.507
This the way it had to be.

Klaus: Writing a love letter
to one of your many suitors?

00:56.156 --> 00:58.457
So who's the lucky recipient then...

00:58.459 --> 01:03.261
Jackson or Elijah?

01:03.263 --> 01:06.131
Don't tell me it's me.

01:06.133 --> 01:08.667
I thought I was out
of the running ages ago.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.502
And the award for biggest ego

01:10.504 --> 01:12.437
goes to...

01:14.774 --> 01:16.208
Oh!

01:20.613 --> 01:23.815
How is our littlest wolf?

01:23.817 --> 01:25.517
Do you want to...

01:32.024 --> 01:33.558
Come on.

01:47.139 --> 01:49.040
Oh!

01:49.042 --> 01:50.542
You feel that?

01:57.416 --> 02:00.018
Right.

02:00.020 --> 02:03.354
I'll leave you to your secret letter then.

Hayley, voice-over: "Dear Zoey..."

02:15.869 --> 02:19.170

02:22.342 --> 02:26.344

if this was a love letter.

"I have no idea what she must have felt

02:36.356 --> 02:37.321
when she carried me."

02:37.323 --> 02:38.823
Let go of me, you bitch!

02:41.227 --> 02:43.027
"So I thought I'd write to you

02:43.029 --> 02:45.062
"so that you could know how happy I am

02:45.064 --> 02:47.698

Oh, God. What happened?

03:55.701 --> 03:57.234
Klaus.

03:57.236 --> 03:59.536
They fought, and he got bit.

03:59.538 --> 04:00.937
Marcel.

04:00.939 --> 04:02.973
It's ok. I gave as good as I got,

04:02.975 --> 04:05.475
but we need Klaus' blood to heal.

04:10.448 --> 04:13.183
You fought Klaus.

04:13.185 --> 04:14.484
Did he bleed?

04:14.486 --> 04:16.486
I got him pretty good, yeah.

04:16.488 --> 04:18.622

What the hell?

04:46.518 --> 04:47.750
Josh, what are you doing here?

04:47.752 --> 04:49.118
I told you to rest.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.386
I'm fine.

04:50.388 --> 04:51.621
You're gonna start hallucinating soon.

04:51.623 --> 04:53.022
I mean, unless I'm

04:53.024 --> 04:54.490
hallucinating you standing

04:54.492 --> 04:57.226
in the middle of the street
and chanting for no reason.

04:59.764 --> 05:01.898
Wait. Am I?

05:01.900 --> 05:03.566
I'm gonna save you.

Ok. Now push.

05:39.070 --> 05:40.302
Gently, gently.

05:40.304 --> 05:42.371

08:01.224 --> 08:03.024
You've been bitten.

08:18.441 --> 08:21.309
There's only enough here for one.

08:21.311 --> 08:24.045
No. This has to be enough!

08:39.461 --> 08:42.697

Please don't make me choose.

08:57.247 --> 08:58.346
I can't.

08:58.348 --> 08:59.514
Judging by the look of that bite,

08:59.516 --> 09:00.681
you don't have time to argue.

09:00.683 --> 09:02.183
Marcel.

09:02.185 --> 09:05.053
Josh is one of my guys,

09:05.055 --> 09:07.488

09:07.490 --> 09:09.524
so come on.

09:17.466 --> 09:21.002
Mikael: One point for you

09:21.004 --> 09:24.038
and one point for Niklaus.

09:36.685 --> 09:38.452
Cami: Hey.

09:38.454 --> 09:39.754
Where do you think you're going?

09:39.756 --> 09:42.223
To find Klaus, get his blood,

09:42.225 --> 09:44.058
and save as many of my guys as I can.

09:44.060 --> 09:45.426
Wait.

09:47.028 --> 09:49.396
For that, you'll need a weapon,

09:49.398 --> 09:51.966
and it just so happens I have an arsenal.

10:03.812 --> 10:06.280
How?

10:06.282 --> 10:08.215
I was bested.

10:08.217 --> 10:10.250
You were bested?

10:15.457 --> 10:17.758
You...

10:17.760 --> 10:21.528
Were bested?!

10:21.530 --> 10:24.131
My invincible brother?

10:29.837 --> 10:34.074
They took the baby, but there's still time.

10:34.076 --> 10:37.144
We can save her.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.683
The tombs are empty, the
grounds are deserted.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.051
She's not here.

10:45.053 --> 10:46.653
This is the only place they can be.

10:46.655 --> 10:47.954
- We'll keep searching.
- They are not here, Niklaus.

10:47.956 --> 10:49.189
We're wasting time.

10:49.191 --> 10:50.357
Their harvest was here,

10:50.359 --> 10:51.658
the reaping was here.

10:51.660 --> 10:53.126
They are about to perform a ritual

10:53.128 --> 10:54.895
which will feed their
ancestors for centuries,

10:54.897 --> 10:57.864
ancestors who are buried here!

11:03.137 --> 11:05.906
This statue.

11:05.908 --> 11:07.774
We've passed by this 3 times

11:07.776 --> 11:10.443
all whilst going in the same direction.

11:24.158 --> 11:26.860
They have fabricated some kind of illusion.

11:33.267 --> 11:35.368
That's one word for it.

11:57.528 --> 11:59.128
So this is what Kieran was hiding.

11:59.130 --> 12:01.063
More like stockpiling.

12:01.065 --> 12:03.099
From what I can gather,
it's mostly weapons.

12:03.101 --> 12:06.068
Dark objects created by witches.

12:06.070 --> 12:09.438
And co-opted by the humans.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.540
Kieran's been keeping
this a secret for years.

12:11.542 --> 12:13.143
You really sure you want
to show me all this?

12:13.210 --> 12:14.909
You said knowing my uncle's secrets

12:14.911 --> 12:16.745
could get me killed.

12:16.747 --> 12:18.513
What if those same secrets
could save the lives

12:18.515 --> 12:20.315
of my friends?

12:20.317 --> 12:21.683
Look at this.

12:21.685 --> 12:23.017
I learned about it in the LycÃ©e.

12:23.019 --> 12:24.886
It's called the devil's star.

12:24.888 --> 12:27.388
They say one throw
can make a thousand cuts.

12:27.390 --> 12:29.357
A thousand cuts sounds about right.

12:29.359 --> 12:31.526
I need to make Klaus bleed.

12:36.332 --> 12:38.866
[Scrape]

12:38.868 --> 12:39.967
It's ingenious.

12:39.969 --> 12:42.103
I can see them, I can feel them,

12:42.105 --> 12:44.072
and yet they are not real.

12:44.074 --> 12:45.339
There has to be a way.

12:45.341 --> 12:46.808
Even if we could just push through.

12:46.810 --> 12:48.342
What we need to do is focus.

12:48.344 --> 12:49.744
My only focus right now is that child

12:49.746 --> 12:51.646
and her safety, do you understand me?

12:51.648 --> 12:53.347
This, all of this,

12:53.349 --> 12:55.550
this is the world that
you created, Niklaus.

12:55.552 --> 12:56.617
Brother.

12:56.619 --> 12:58.119
All of your scheming,

12:58.121 --> 12:59.820
the enemies that you have
made every single day

12:59.822 --> 13:00.955
of your miserable life.

13:00.957 --> 13:02.890
What results did you expect?

13:02.892 --> 13:04.926
That your child would be
born into a happy life,

13:04.928 --> 13:06.694
that the mother would be alive

13:06.696 --> 13:08.029
to know her daughter,

13:08.031 --> 13:09.730
that we could live and thrive

13:09.732 --> 13:11.132
as some sort of family?

13:11.134 --> 13:13.401
That was your fantasy, brother, not mine!

13:13.403 --> 13:14.735
No, brother.

13:14.737 --> 13:17.004
This was our hope.

13:17.006 --> 13:21.809
This was our family's hope,

13:21.811 --> 13:24.545
and now she is gone.

13:24.547 --> 13:25.646
Do you understand?

13:25.648 --> 13:29.383
I... Let this person in.

13:31.019 --> 13:33.888
I let her in.

13:33.890 --> 13:36.090
I don't let people in.

13:36.092 --> 13:38.225
You knew this,

13:38.227 --> 13:40.594
and you've taken her from me.

13:43.265 --> 13:46.033
I needed her, and you've broken me.

14:06.187 --> 14:08.088
You can tell your niece

14:08.090 --> 14:12.259
how much you cared for her mother

14:12.261 --> 14:14.228
when we save her.

14:38.119 --> 14:39.619
[Gasps]

14:49.063 --> 14:50.830
Aah!

14:50.832 --> 14:52.332
Push!

14:55.236 --> 14:56.670
No!

14:57.772 --> 14:59.005
[Crying]

15:10.317 --> 15:11.718
The moon has almost faded

15:11.720 --> 15:13.419
from the morning sky.

15:17.157 --> 15:19.325
I need to prepare.

15:21.795 --> 15:24.631
[Baby crying]

15:27.635 --> 15:28.968
She'll go through with it.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.937
The ancestors promised her her life.

15:30.939 --> 15:32.638
What about their promise to us?

15:32.640 --> 15:34.140
4 harvest girls sacrificed,

15:34.142 --> 15:35.742
4 girls returned,

15:35.744 --> 15:37.076
but her friends hijack it,

15:37.078 --> 15:39.011
and ours have to stay dead?

15:39.013 --> 15:41.848
Cassie was our friend.

15:41.850 --> 15:43.082
I hope she doesn't go through with it.

15:43.084 --> 15:44.450
Then you and I can do

15:44.452 --> 15:45.852
what the ancestors want,

15:45.854 --> 15:49.422
and they'll give us Cassie...

15:49.424 --> 15:52.491

to Francesca's claim to leadership.

28:47.094 --> 28:48.793
They will never be safe.

28:53.967 --> 28:57.268

every day of my miserable life?

28:57.270 --> 29:02.240
Well, the worst of them are
within these borders, brother.

29:02.242 --> 29:03.741
I have brought into the world

29:03.743 --> 29:05.577
a weapon they can use against me.

29:05.579 --> 29:07.513
Then we will arm ourselves.

29:07.526 --> 29:11.482
Brother, we've fought every adversary
in this town and we have won,

29:11.484 --> 29:12.984
and we'll fight them again,

29:12.986 --> 29:14.719
no matter who they are.

29:14.721 --> 29:16.955
We'll make this home a fortress.

29:16.957 --> 29:19.957
I will not have her live
her life as a prisoner.

29:19.959 --> 29:22.627
Then we leave here together, all of us.

29:22.629 --> 29:24.862
Wherever we go,

29:24.864 --> 29:26.497
however far we run,

29:26.499 --> 29:29.367
those who seek power
and revenge will hunt us,

29:29.369 --> 29:32.770
they will hunt her.

29:32.772 --> 29:34.539
She has inherited all our enemies

29:34.541 --> 29:36.174
with none of our defenses.

29:36.176 --> 29:37.842
So whether we stay or we leave,

29:37.844 --> 29:39.177
we condemn her.

29:39.179 --> 29:41.045
Hayley: There is a third option.

29:44.449 --> 29:47.685
I grew up in a war zone.

29:47.687 --> 29:50.454
My parents thought they could protect me,

29:50.456 --> 29:52.623
but in the end, they were slaughtered,

29:52.625 --> 29:57.261
and I spent my childhood alone and unloved.

30:03.869 --> 30:07.271
I made a promise to
my baby and to myself...

30:09.474 --> 30:12.877
That she would not grow up like I did,

30:12.879 --> 30:16.814
that she would grow up safe and loved,

30:16.816 --> 30:19.483
and yet here she is on
her first day in this world

30:19.485 --> 30:24.254
with a grandmother that
is bent on sacrificing her

30:24.256 --> 30:27.157
and a mother that has to drink the blood

30:27.159 --> 30:29.727
of her own baby to survive transitioning

30:29.729 --> 30:32.196
into a hybrid,

30:32.198 --> 30:35.099
and I'm the one that loves her the most.

30:42.707 --> 30:47.010
I think the only thing to do is

30:47.012 --> 30:49.813
send her away while we stay behind

30:49.815 --> 30:53.116
and clean up the mess that we've made.

30:54.698 --> 30:57.621
No. This is insane.

30:57.623 --> 30:59.122
You heard Genevieve.

30:59.124 --> 31:02.926
So long as she lives,
that baby will be hunted.

31:07.131 --> 31:11.201
Not if no one knows she lives.

31:46.104 --> 31:47.771
of its worst elements.

31:47.773 --> 31:49.405
We will work together

31:49.407 --> 31:53.710
to ensure the heart of the Crescent City

32:53.504 --> 32:55.237
that he created?

32:55.239 --> 32:57.807
I'm thinking he's gonna side with us,

especially after he finds out

32:59.377 --> 33:02.945
that your pack killed his kid.

33:04.114 --> 33:05.681
What?

33:07.384 --> 33:08.484
Open the box

33:08.486 --> 33:09.885
and let me know what you think

33:09.887 --> 33:11.220
Klaus will believe about who's responsible

33:11.222 --> 33:13.422
for what you find inside of it.

33:20.230 --> 33:22.698
Cremation may be the best way to go

This is...

34:24.588 --> 34:25.721
This is all my fault.

34:25.723 --> 34:27.922
I can assure you it is not.

34:27.925 --> 34:30.092
No. If I hadn't hesitated,

34:30.094 --> 34:31.627
I could have uncovered Francesca's plot

34:31.629 --> 34:33.094
in time to stop it.

stopped the coven of witches

35:05.128 --> 35:06.761
What?

35:07.997 --> 35:10.632
You had me pegged from the start,

35:10.634 --> 35:12.834
a man damaged by his demons,

35:12.836 --> 35:14.002
and those demons are not dormant.

35:14.004 --> 35:16.738
They are hell-bent on killing me

35:16.740 --> 35:19.474
and everything I find beautiful...

35:21.210 --> 35:22.877
And you...

35:25.147 --> 35:27.615
You are beautiful.

35:30.686 --> 35:33.621
Please, please just go.

35:33.623 --> 35:34.989
Klaus.

35:36.492 --> 35:37.959
Go.

35:58.347 --> 36:00.448
Did Marcel play his part?

36:00.450 --> 36:02.717
He managed to locate a stillborn baby

36:02.719 --> 36:04.886
in a hospital in upstate Louisiana.

36:04.888 --> 36:06.721
I trust he agreed to the terms.

36:06.723 --> 36:08.956
He has agreed to allow me to compel him

36:08.958 --> 36:12.226
to forget what he knows of my child.

36:12.228 --> 36:14.996
In exchange, he wants vials of my blood.

36:14.998 --> 36:17.631
The witches will have to believe this.

36:17.633 --> 36:21.001
Soon that fourth
harvest girl will resurrect.

36:21.003 --> 36:23.237
The coven will rebuild.

36:23.239 --> 36:24.738
If they sense that your child lives,

36:24.740 --> 36:26.006
they will hunt her.

36:26.008 --> 36:30.177
The witches will buy what we sell.

36:30.179 --> 36:32.746
We just have to sell it properly.

36:42.023 --> 36:45.092
Then all that remains is to say goodbye.

36:45.094 --> 36:47.928
[Music playing]

36:49.898 --> 36:52.733
[Baby cooing]

36:54.069 --> 36:56.370
[Cries]

37:06.481 --> 37:08.982
[Crying]

37:30.204 --> 37:33.073
Klaus, voice-over:
They will be watching us,

37:33.075 --> 37:36.042
all of them.

37:36.044 --> 37:40.447
The 3 of us leaving together
will draw too much attention.

37:40.449 --> 37:42.182
I will go alone.

37:43.918 --> 37:47.387
Take your mourning public when I'm gone.

37:47.389 --> 37:49.923
Elijah, voice-over: I don't imagine
that will be too difficult.

37:52.126 --> 37:55.695
Grief, after all, is grief.

38:00.768 --> 38:04.738
In what world will she be safe without us?

38:04.740 --> 38:07.207
Who can protect her better than we?

38:09.009 --> 38:10.710
There is one person.

38:23.691 --> 38:25.558
Hello, sister.

38:32.766 --> 38:35.034
She looks like her mother.

38:37.371 --> 38:39.205
Maybe there is a God after all.

38:41.975 --> 38:45.344
Well, she has a hint
of the devil in her eyes.

38:46.914 --> 38:48.581
That's all me.

38:52.819 --> 38:55.021
You'll need a witch you can trust

38:55.023 --> 38:56.589
to cast a cloaking spell.

38:56.591 --> 38:57.790
I'll get one.

38:57.792 --> 38:59.358
No one can ever find her.

38:59.360 --> 39:00.826
I know what to do, Nik.

39:00.828 --> 39:03.929
[Cooing]

39:03.931 --> 39:06.499
Perhaps we'll get a white fence.

39:06.501 --> 39:08.834
I think that would be lovely.

39:20.480 --> 39:23.549
This city would have seen you dead,

39:23.551 --> 39:26.819
but I will have it your home,

39:26.821 --> 39:31.523
and every soul who wishes you harm

39:31.525 --> 39:33.559
will be struck down.

39:33.561 --> 39:38.030
Just as sure as my blood
runs in your veins,

39:38.032 --> 39:42.034
you will return to me.

39:46.740 --> 39:49.241
[Cooing]

40:04.591 --> 40:06.591
In spite of our differences, Rebekah,

40:06.593 --> 40:10.595
there is no one I would trust
more with my daughter's life.

40:16.969 --> 40:20.305
Be happy... Sister.

40:21.541 --> 40:24.442
She will be happy, Nik, I promise.

40:25.978 --> 40:27.612
What's her name?

40:32.118 --> 40:33.785
Hope.

40:36.022 --> 40:38.323
Her name is Hope.

41:25.137 --> 41:28.039
May you rest in peace.

41:28.041 --> 41:30.141
What's the fun in that?

41:32.211 --> 41:34.212
Come along.

41:34.214 --> 41:36.013
We have much to do.

41:37.460 --> 41:38.983
Yes mother.

41:49.214 --> 41:51.883
