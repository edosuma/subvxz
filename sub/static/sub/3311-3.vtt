STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:11.745 --> 00:14.582
JOE, NICE TRY WITH
THE VEGAS BUFFET,

00:14.615 --> 00:16.250
BUT THESE KIDS DON'T
REALLY EAT WAFFLES.

00:16.284 --> 00:19.420
- NO, THESE ARE AMAZING.
- YOU NEVER LIKED WAFFLES BEFORE.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.255
THESE AREN'T YOURS.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.592
YEAH, THERE'S NO ICE CRYSTALS

00:24.625 --> 00:26.160
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PRY THEM APART.

00:26.194 --> 00:29.130
- AND THERE'S NO WAX PAPER...
- ALL RIGHT, STOP.

00:29.163 --> 00:32.032
I SEE. YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO SHOW
ME UP WITH THE KIDS, BUT COME ON.

00:32.066 --> 00:34.502
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THERE'S
NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THESE.

00:34.535 --> 00:37.438
OH, MY MOTHER OF PEARL!

00:37.471 --> 00:40.641

00:42.343 --> 00:44.212
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.580
YOU CAN JUST HAVE A COLD
ENGLISH MUFFIN THEN.

00:46.614 --> 00:49.550
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M ACTUALLY
JUST GONNA TAKE A FEW OF THESE

00:49.583 --> 00:51.285

00:51.319 --> 00:53.087
YEAH, I THINK THERE'S SOME PEOPLE
THERE THAT MIGHT LIKE THEM.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.722
I DON'T LIKE THEM, BUT...

00:54.755 --> 00:57.091
ALL RIGHT, WELL, HERE. DON'T FORGET
THE BOURBON PECAN MAPLE SYRUP THEN.

00:57.125 --> 00:58.759

SO WHEN YOU'RE NOT SAVING
HELPLESS SHOPPERS,

01:59.820 --> 02:01.589
DO YOU EVER HAVE COFFEE?

02:01.622 --> 02:02.823
LATELY I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO CUT BACK

02:02.856 --> 02:05.593
'CAUSE COFFEE ACTUALLY
DEHYDRATES ME SO... OH.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.730
YOU MEAN "HAVE COFFEE."

02:10.764 --> 02:12.733
WOW.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.668
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I
JUST SEPARATED FROM MY WIFE

02:14.702 --> 02:17.805

I'M ACTUALLY FREE RIGHT NOW UNTIL
I HAVE TO GO PICK UP THE KIDS.

02:41.429 --> 02:43.631
A DEVOTED SINGLE FATHER.
I LIKE THAT.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.233
NO, I'M NOT A FATHER.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.668
ACTUALLY, I'M A NANNY.

02:47.701 --> 02:50.504
( laughs ) AND A SENSE OF HUMOR.

02:50.538 --> 02:51.805
I LIKE THAT TOO.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.775
( laughs ) SERIOUSLY,
I'M A NANNY.

02:54.808 --> 02:57.211
- ( beeping )
- HANG ON.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.413
OH, GREAT.

02:59.447 --> 03:02.683
WORK EMERGENCY. ONE OF MY WEB
SITES JUST CAUGHT ON FIRE.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.754
YEAH, TODAY'S NO
GOOD FOR ME, EITHER.

03:10.758 --> 03:13.527
MY HAIR APPOINTMENT'S
TODAY WITH YOUR STYLIST.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.696
DO I TELL HIM TO MAKE ME LOOK
LIKE TAYLOR SWIFT FROM MARCH

03:15.729 --> 03:17.698
OR TAYLOR SWIFT FROM APRIL?

03:17.731 --> 03:20.234
THEY CAN DO THAT TO YOUR FACE?

03:20.268 --> 03:21.869
YOU SEE THIS, RYDER?

03:21.902 --> 03:23.737
IT'S A HOT GIRL.

03:23.771 --> 03:26.407
AND THIS IS AS CLOSE AS
YOU'LL EVER GET TO ONE.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.742
I'M GOOD WITH THAT.

03:30.811 --> 03:34.515
MORNING, MORNING, MORNING.

03:35.516 --> 03:36.917
THIS IS NOT A TASTY WAFFLE.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.219
YEAH, I'M NOT REALLY IN
A TASTY WAFFLE MOOD.

03:39.253 --> 03:41.689
I AM. WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED TO BREAKFAST?

03:41.722 --> 03:44.725
I MEAN, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

03:44.758 --> 03:46.894
ALL RIGHT, I WAS AT THE MARKET,
RAN INTO THIS REALLY CUTE GIRL.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.729
WE STARTED TALKING.
TOTALLY HIT IT OFF

03:48.762 --> 03:49.897
UNTIL I TOLD HER
THAT I WAS A NANNY.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.665
SHE RAN OUT OF THERE SO QUICK

03:51.699 --> 03:53.667
SHE LEFT A HOT GIRL-SHAPED
HOLE IN THE SIDE OF THE STORE.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.637
JOE, THAT REALLY SUCKS.

03:56.670 --> 03:59.740
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS YOU
REMEMBERED TO GET THE PUDDING, RIGHT?

03:59.773 --> 04:02.810
LOOK, THAT WAS JUST ONE
SHALLOW WOMAN, OKAY?

04:02.843 --> 04:05.212
THERE ARE BOUND TO BE LOTS OF
WOMEN WHO'LL BE ATTRACTED TO YOU.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.748
NOT ME, GOD NO, BUT SOMEBODY.

04:07.781 --> 04:10.951
THANK YOU, BURKE.
I'M ALL BETTER NOW.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.687
THERE ARE BILLIONS OF
WOMEN OUT THERE, OKAY?

04:13.721 --> 04:15.689
THE MATH IS TOTALLY
ON YOUR SIDE.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.691
OH, GREAT. SO MATH
IS MY WINGMAN.

04:17.725 --> 04:20.461
- ALL I'M SAYING IS...
- NO, LOOK, I'M FINE.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.896
I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING LATER THIS AFTERNOON
THAT'S GONNA CHEER ME UP ANYWAYS.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.366
- OH, REALLY, WHAT?
- MY DIVORCE HEARING.

04:25.399 --> 04:28.436
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M GONNA GO PICK
OUT A TIE TO GO WITH LOSING MY SHIRT.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.640
OW.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.742
DO YOU REALLY THINK A WOMAN IS GONNA
WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH A NANNY?

04:34.775 --> 04:37.311
NO, BUT I WANT MY
BELGIAN WAFFLES BACK.

04:37.345 --> 04:39.613
AND I'M NOT GONNA GET SOME
UNTIL HE GETS SOME...

04:39.647 --> 04:41.849
THING. SOMETHING.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.884
THAT WAS SO CLOSE
TO BEING AWKWARD.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.557
THE ZONING HEARING WAS
PUSHED TO TOMORROW.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.859
AND LAST AND MOST IMPORTANTLY
ON THE AGENDA THIS MORNING...

04:51.892 --> 04:53.494
MUFFINS!

04:53.527 --> 04:55.796
OOH! I DON'T THINK I CAN.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.631
I HAD WAFFLES YESTERDAY.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.800
YOU HAD CARBS WITHOUT ME?

04:59.833 --> 05:01.669
JOE MADE SYRUP

05:01.702 --> 05:03.737
WITH BOURBON, PECANS
AND CINNAMON.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.340
IT WAS LIKE CHRISTMAS

06:04.832 --> 06:07.468
BACK IN COLLEGE DID YOU
EVER THINK EITHER OF US

06:07.501 --> 06:09.603
WOULD BE WALKING THE
HALLS OF POWER?

06:09.637 --> 06:12.540
MAYBE, IN HANDCUFFS.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.374
HEY, I HOPE I'M NOT
INTERRUPTING ANYTHING.

06:14.408 --> 06:15.676
I WAS A LITTLE EARLY FOR
MY HEARING NEXT DOOR,

06:15.709 --> 06:17.545
SO I THOUGHT I'D
STOP BY AND SAY HI.

06:17.578 --> 06:20.548
YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT JUST HERE TO USE
OUR INCREDIBLY CLEAN BATHROOMS?

06:20.581 --> 06:22.783
WHAT? NO.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.785
THE KEY'S NOT ON RHONDA'S DESK.
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

06:24.818 --> 06:26.920

SO ANY CHANCE YOU CAN MAYBE
HOOK A LITTLE SISTER UP?

07:14.902 --> 07:17.004
ABSOLUTELY.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.039

TARTLET TO START.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.628
OOH, I'VE NEVER HAD TARTLET.
I'VE BEEN CALLED ONE.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.164
- THIS IS MAC AND CHEESE.
- YEAH, ISN'T THAT FUNNY?

07:44.197 --> 07:45.866

07:45.899 --> 07:48.135
RYDER, LENNOX, DINNER'S READY!

07:48.168 --> 07:50.103
DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.172
DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH ME TELLING LIZ

07:52.205 --> 07:54.007
YOU'RE A FINANCIAL CONSULTANT
INSTEAD OF A NANNY?

07:54.041 --> 07:55.776
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.
- LIAR.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.878
TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.680
LOOK, I JUST WANTED LIZ
TO GO OUT WITH YOU.

07:59.713 --> 08:02.015
SO BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS IF I TELL PEOPLE I'M A NANNY,

08:02.049 --> 08:04.552
I'M NEVER EVER GONNA HAVE SEX...

08:04.585 --> 08:07.855
SAFE SEX...

08:07.888 --> 08:09.757
WITH A WOMAN EVER AGAIN.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.825
MRS. GELLER AT THE END OF
THE BLOCK IS AVAILABLE.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.661
DUDE, SHE'S LIKE 100.

08:13.694 --> 08:16.730
PUT SOME NEW TENNIS BALLS ON HER
WALKER, YOU COULD MAKE IT HAPPEN.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.804
BY "IT," DO YOU MEAN
A HEART ATTACK?

08:29.042 --> 08:30.678
WHAT?

08:32.646 --> 08:34.181
NOTHING. NOTHING.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.817
NONE OF US NOTICED
THAT SOCK MONKEY

08:36.850 --> 08:40.253
THAT YOU KILLED AND
PUT ON YOUR HEAD.

08:40.287 --> 08:43.791
I'M WEARING THIS BECAUSE OF WHAT
YOUR HAIR BUTCHER DID TO ME.

08:43.824 --> 08:46.760
IT WAS SO AWFUL I HAD
TO RE-CUT IT MYSELF.

08:46.794 --> 08:49.763
YOU CUT YOUR OWN HAIR?

08:49.797 --> 08:51.832
I LOVE YOUR HAT.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.802
( beeping )

08:54.835 --> 08:57.237
HEY, MEL, YOUR FRIEND
LIZ JUST TEXTED ME.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.106
SHE WANTS ME TO MEET HER

08:59.139 --> 09:02.743
SO THIS IS WHERE YOU THANK ME FOR
HOOKING YOU UP WITH A SMOKIN' HOT GIRL

09:02.776 --> 09:05.512
BY HOOKING ME UP WITH A
SMOKIN' HOT ONION TARTLET.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.081
WHY BOTHER? WHEN SHE FINDS OUT WHAT I
DO IT'S GONNA BE A TOTALLY MOOT POINT.

09:08.115 --> 09:11.284
OKAY, LOOK, SHE WANTS TO
GO OUT WITH YOU, OKAY?

09:11.318 --> 09:13.954
SHE MET YOU. SHE LIKES
YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.989
JUST DON'T TELL HER WHAT
YOU DO FOR A LIVING.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.726
SHE WAS KIND OF CUTE. WE DID SORT
OF HAVE A LITTLE CONNECTION.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.794
- I DON'T KNOW.
- OKAY, DO WHAT YOU WANT.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.863
THERE'S ALWAYS MRS.
GELLER AS A BACKUP.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.633
SOLD.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.306

09:33.340 --> 09:35.676
SO HOW DID COFFEE WITH LIZ GO?

09:35.709 --> 09:36.677
IT WENT OKAY.

09:36.710 --> 09:40.013
LAMB, CHUTNEY, MASALA SAUCE.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.750
SOMETHING TELLS ME
THAT COFFEE ESCALATED

09:42.783 --> 09:44.718
INTO SOME BAM-CHICKA-WOW-WOW.

09:44.752 --> 09:46.286
IT ACTUALLY WENT GOOD.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.689
WE HAVEN'T TECHNICALLY GOT
INTO THE WOW-WOW PART YET,

09:48.722 --> 09:50.057
BUT WE GOT REALLY CLOSE.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.793
I KNEW LYING WAS THE
WAY TO GO FOR YOU.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.695
- YEAH, I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT...
- NO NO NO.

09:54.728 --> 09:58.331
YOU LET ME DO THE THINKING. YOU SIT
ACROSS FROM LIZ AND LOOK PRETTY.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.200
LOOK, IT WENT REALLY WELL
WITH LIZ, ALL RIGHT?

10:00.233 --> 10:02.035
IT MIGHT ACTUALLY GO SOMEWHERE,
BUT NOT IF I KEEP LYING TO HER.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.972
LYING IS SUCH AN UGLY WORD.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.074
BUT IT'S THE RIGHT WORD,
SO LET'S GO WITH THAT.

10:07.107 --> 10:10.944
IN THE BEGINNING OF A RELATIONSHIP
EVERYONE SCULPTS THE TRUTH A BIT.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.746
TAKE THE PUSH-UP BRA.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.849
IN THAT CASE, YOU WOULD LIFT
AND SEPARATE THE TRUTH.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.217
YOU HAVE ME IN A PUSH-UP BRA?

10:17.250 --> 10:19.619
YEAH, AND IT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.989
YEAH? WELL, IT'S STARTING
TO FEEL A LITTLE PINCHY.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.591
ALL RIGHT, LOOK. I AM SEEING HER FRIDAY
NIGHT AND THE TRUTH IS COMING OUT.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.728
FINE. MAYBE BY THEN SHE'LL
HAVE FALLEN FOR YOU

10:27.761 --> 10:30.731
AND YOU'LL BE READY TO TAKE OFF THE
PUSH-UP BRA AND LET THE GIRLS FLY.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.103
YOUR AUNT IS SPEAKING
FIGURATIVELY.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.673
I ALWAYS PRAYED FOR A
NANNY IN A PUSH-UP BRA.

10:39.707 --> 10:43.110
FUNNY. REAL FUNNY, GOD.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.947
- ( knock on door )
- Liz: HEY.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.717
JUST WANTED TO STOP BY AND THANK
YOU FOR HOOKING ME UP WITH JOE.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.719
I'M GOING WITH HIM
TO DINNER TONIGHT.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.855
GOD, IT IS SO NICE TO FINALLY
FIND A NORMAL, STABLE GUY

10:54.888 --> 10:56.824
WITH A GOOD JOB.

11:01.795 --> 11:04.264
THAT'S WHY WE CALL HIM
"STABLE GOOD JOB JOE."

11:04.297 --> 11:07.067
OH, AND SPEAKING OF JOBS...
LANDED IT!

11:07.100 --> 11:09.069
I'M GONNA BE WORKING FOR
THE MAYOR'S OFFICE.

11:09.102 --> 11:12.272
AWESOME. I'M SO PROUD OF MY LITTLE GAMMA
SISTER. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA BE DOING?

11:12.305 --> 11:14.074
I'M LOOKING INTO
WASTE AND FRAUD.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.744
I'M GONNA DOING THIS IN-DEPTH AUDIT
OF ALL THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS.

11:16.777 --> 11:20.080
I DON'T ENVY THOSE POOR BAS...
SAY WHAT?

11:20.113 --> 11:23.717
CHILLAX. I KNOW MY BIG SISTER
WOULD NEVER LIE TO ME.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.919
PSHAW. HUH-UH.

11:25.953 --> 11:28.188
COME ON, GIRL. YOUR AUDIT
IS GONNA BE A BREEZE.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.757
IT'S GONNA TAKE,
LIKE, TWO MINUTES.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.759
I CAN ALWAYS TRUST A GAMMA.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.161
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I AM-A.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.330
HOWEVER, YOUR FELLOW
CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS...

11:37.364 --> 11:41.001
I'M GONNA PUT THEIR NUTS
IN A VISE AND SQUEEZE.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.702
IT'S GONNA BE REALLY FUN.

11:42.736 --> 11:45.873
( laughs )

11:45.906 --> 11:47.707
YOU'RE SCREWED, AREN'T YOU?

11:47.741 --> 11:49.109
YEAH, WORSE THAN PLEDGE WEEK.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.185
OH, THANK GOODNESS
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.188
- WHAT'S UP?
- NOTHING. I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU TO HAVE FUN

12:01.221 --> 12:03.023
- ON YOUR DATE TONIGHT.
- I WILL.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.724
ACTUALLY GOT A GREAT
EVENING PLANNED.

12:04.758 --> 12:05.993
I USED YOUR NAME TO GET US A
RESERVATION AT CHEZ PAPILLON.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.427
YEAH, SOUNDS MAGICAL.

12:07.460 --> 12:10.730
LISTEN, IT MAY NOT
BE A HORRIBLE IDEA

12:10.764 --> 12:14.134
- TO KEEP THE PUSH-UP BRA ON JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER.
- WHY?

12:14.167 --> 12:17.170
LIZ MAY NOT BE READY TO HEAR
ABOUT YOU BEING A NANNY.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.372
WELL, IF SHE'S NOT READY, I'M
READY TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.042
YEAH, BUT I'M NOT...

12:22.075 --> 12:24.878
READY TO WATCH YOUR
RELATIONSHIP DIE.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.947
WOW.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.850
IF THAT'S HOW WELL YOU LIE,
HOW DID YOU GET ELECTED?

12:29.883 --> 12:31.952
OKAY, THE TRUTH IS...

12:31.985 --> 12:34.187
AND IT'S KIND OF
FUNNY ACTUALLY...

12:34.221 --> 12:37.858
LIZ WAS HIRED TO AUDIT ALL
THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS.

12:37.891 --> 12:41.394
OH, I SEE. SO IF SHE FINDS OUT
YOU LIED TO HER ABOUT ME...

12:41.428 --> 12:44.497
SHE'LL PUT MY NUTS IN A VISE.

12:44.531 --> 12:47.067
ARE YOU SURE YOU WEREN'T
IN A FRATERNITY?

12:47.100 --> 12:50.470
WELL, I WAS IN
PLENTY OF THOSE TOO.

12:50.503 --> 12:53.173
NO, PLEASE PLEASE, OKAY?
THREE MORE DAYS, OKAY?

12:53.206 --> 12:55.909
THAT'S WHEN THE AUDIT'S OVER.
YOU'RE MY ONLY HOPE.

12:55.943 --> 12:58.045
I NEED TO KEEP MY HONEST
REPUTATION INTACT.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.914
- SO THEREFORE I HAVE TO LIE.
- YES, PLEASE, LIE FOR ME.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.916
LIE YOUR HEART OUT, OKAY?

13:02.950 --> 13:05.252
COOK UP A DECEPTION CASSEROLE
FULL OF LIES AND FALSEHOODS

13:05.285 --> 13:07.454
TOPPED WITH A THICK
GLAZE OF B.S.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.092
AGAIN, YOUR AUNT WAS
SPEAKING FIGURATIVELY.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.894
THAT'S COOL.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.795
I'M GONNA GO OUT AND FIND
MYSELF A ROLE MODEL.

13:24.237 --> 13:27.307
HEY, SO HOW'D IT GO?

13:27.340 --> 13:29.276
AWFUL.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.278
WE HAD A REALLY ROMANTIC
DINNER, GOT BACK TO THE CAR,

13:31.311 --> 13:33.947
STARTED TO MAKE OUT, THEN SHE WANTED
ME TO TAKE ME BACK TO HER PLACE.

13:33.981 --> 13:36.783
SO A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
WANTED TO SLEEP WITH YOU?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.919
BOO FREAKIN' HOO.

13:38.952 --> 13:41.855
I COULDN'T DO IT UNDER
FALSE PRETENSES.

13:41.889 --> 13:44.491
OH, WOW. THAT'S LIKE, HONORABLE.

13:44.524 --> 13:48.328
SERIOUSLY, I REALLY APPRECIATE
THE SACRIFICE YOU MADE.

13:48.361 --> 13:51.364
I DON'T THINK YOU DO.

13:57.905 --> 14:00.407
I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING
I COULD DO TO HELP,

14:00.440 --> 14:03.843
BUT THAT'S REALLY NOT MY AREA.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.881
YOU KNOW WHAT? I CAN'T TAKE THIS.
I AM GOING WITH THE TRUTH.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.549
- I'M CALLING LIZ RIGHT NOW.
- NO NO NO NO NO.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.418
- YES, I AM.
- WAIT WAIT WAIT.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.486
JUST THREE MORE DAYS IS ALL
I'M ASKING YOU TO HOLD OUT.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.822
TWO AND A HALF REALLY IF YOU
DON'T COUNT HALF A DAY.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.357
WHY WOULD I NOT
COUNT HALF A DAY?

14:17.390 --> 14:19.592
BECAUSE IT MAKES
IT SOUND SHORTER.

14:19.626 --> 14:23.430
I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS, MEL.
I CAN BARELY WALK LIKE THIS.

14:23.463 --> 14:26.900
FINE. FINE, I'LL JUST DEAL
WITH THE PUBLIC EMBARRASSMENT

14:26.934 --> 14:29.336
AND THE DAMAGE TO MY IMAGE.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.838
YOU KNOW, THE IMAGE I'VE
WORKED ON SO HARD TO PROVE

14:31.871 --> 14:34.507
I'M NOT JUST AN IRRESPONSIBLE,
FLAKY PARTY GIRL ANYMORE.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.878
FINE, THREE MORE DAYS. NO MORE.

14:38.912 --> 14:42.149
OH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU! YOU CAN TOTALLY DO THIS.

14:42.182 --> 14:45.418
WE JUST HAVE TO FIND A WAY
TO KEEP YOUR MIND OFF SEX.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.255
OOH, CALL YOUR MOM.
YEAH, TRY IT.

14:49.656 --> 14:52.192
- THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
- IT'LL WORK.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.661
THERE IS NO MOOD-KILLER
LIKE A MOTHER.

14:57.130 --> 15:00.867
HEY, MOM, WHAT'S UP?
DID I WAKE YOU?

15:00.900 --> 15:03.203
OH, YOU'RE STILL DEALING
WITH THE FOOT, HUH?

15:03.236 --> 15:04.938
NO WAY. YOU'RE DRAINING
THE BOIL RIGHT NOW?

15:04.972 --> 15:06.974
TELL ME ABOUT IT, MOM.
PLEASE TELL ME ABOUT IT.

15:11.178 --> 15:12.879
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"WHAT'S GOING ON?"

15:12.912 --> 15:16.516
WHAT'S SO SUSPICIOUS ABOUT A SON
CALLING HIS MOTHER SIX, EIGHT,

15:16.549 --> 15:17.917
10 TIMES A DAY?

15:17.951 --> 15:21.454
I JUST WANNA HEAR ABOUT
YOUR COLONOSCOPY.

15:21.488 --> 15:24.057
AGAIN, JUST ONE MORE
TIME, MOM, PLEASE.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.259
MOM, HELLO, MOM.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.395
- ( beep )
- ( doorbell rings )

15:28.428 --> 15:30.430
YEAH.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.669
LIZ, YOU'RE HERE.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.672
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME HONKING?
I WAS RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.408
CAN I COME IN?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.910
OF COURSE. YEAH, COME ON IN.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.579
I'VE BEEN DYING TO SHOW
YOU MY PLACE ANYWAY,

15:46.613 --> 15:49.449
WHERE I, IN FACT, LIVE NOW.

15:49.482 --> 15:52.252
WOW, IT'S BEAUTIFUL. HOW
LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?

15:52.285 --> 15:54.621
ABOUT 10 SECONDS
LONGER THAN YOU.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.656
FUNNY.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.925
NO, SERIOUSLY, I LOVE
THESE THROW PILLOWS

15:58.958 --> 16:01.194
AND THOSE SCONCES.

16:01.228 --> 16:03.663
I'M ALL ABOUT SCONCES, LIZ.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.332
WOW, THOSE WINDOW TREATMENTS.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.400
WAIT A MINUTE.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.669
SOMETHING'S GOING ON HERE,
BECAUSE NO MAN WOULD PICK OUT

16:09.702 --> 16:13.640
THOSE WINDOW
TREATMENTS BY HIMSELF.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.343
YOU HIRED A DECORATOR,
DIDN'T YOU?

16:16.376 --> 16:20.013
GUILTY. GUILTY AS CHARGED.

16:21.448 --> 16:24.217
YOU ARE SO FULL OF SURPRISES.

16:24.251 --> 16:25.685
OH, WELL.

16:25.718 --> 16:28.688
I REALLY LIKE LEARNING ALL
THESE NEW THINGS ABOUT YOU.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.224
ME TOO.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.260
YOU WANNA... I DON'T... OKAY.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.201
( Liz gasps )

16:41.234 --> 16:43.203
WHO'S THAT?

16:43.236 --> 16:44.704
- I'M RYDER.
- HE'S RYDER.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.573
- WHO'S RYDER?
- I'M JOE'S NEPHEW.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.541
HE'S MY NEPHEW.

16:48.575 --> 16:51.744
JOE TOOK ME IN 'CAUSE MY DAD'S
ON THE RUN FROM THE LAW.

16:51.778 --> 16:55.415
YOU NEVER TOLD ME YOU TOOK SOMEBODY
ELSE'S CHILD INTO YOUR HOME.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.984
I WAS HOPING I WOULD
NEVER HAVE TO SAY THAT.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.387
- OH, WHO'S THIS?
- OH BOY.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.555
THIS IS LENNOX, MY SISTER.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.557
JOE TOOK HER IN TOO.

17:04.591 --> 17:07.394
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU COULD
BREAK UP THE SET, RIGHT?

17:08.461 --> 17:10.130
SHE WAS REAL SICK,

17:10.163 --> 17:12.265
WHICH EXPLAINS HER FUNNY HAT.

17:12.299 --> 17:14.667
RIGHT? HE TOOK YOU IN TOO.

17:14.701 --> 17:18.571
YEAH, JOE GAVE ME A KIDNEY.

17:20.073 --> 17:21.708
NOW I CAN PEE AGAIN.

17:23.743 --> 17:27.480
JOE, THAT IS SO UNBELIEVABLE.

17:27.514 --> 17:30.783
I COULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU MORE.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.720
HEY, HOW'S EVERYBODY...
HOLY CRAP!

17:33.753 --> 17:36.323
MEL, HEY.

17:36.356 --> 17:39.592
LIZ FOLLOWED ME HOME. YOU
KNOW, BACK TO MY HOUSE.

17:39.626 --> 17:42.562
- OH, WHERE YOU NOW LIVE.
- MM-HMM.

17:42.595 --> 17:45.232
WHY DOES MEL HAVE A
KEY TO YOUR HOUSE?

17:45.265 --> 17:47.567
LOTS OF PEOPLE TRADE
KEYS WITH THEIR FRIENDS.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.669
- YEAH, SHE FEEDS MY DOG.
- I WATER HIS PLANTS.

17:49.702 --> 17:52.472
- I FEED HIS DOG.
- SHE WATERS THE PLANTS.

17:52.505 --> 17:55.608
WHY IS THERE A PICTURE OF
MEL ON YOUR COFFEE TABLE?

17:55.642 --> 17:58.645
BECAUSE SHE'S MY
CITY COUNCIL PERSON

17:58.678 --> 18:01.114
AND SHE FIGHTS FOR ME.

18:01.148 --> 18:03.816
AND THE REASON THAT MEL'S NAME

18:03.850 --> 18:07.154
- IS ALL OVER YOUR MAIL?
- OH OH, THAT'S EASY.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.589
I USED TO OWN THE HOUSE AND
NOW JOE BOUGHT IT FROM ME.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.559
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED, JOE?

18:12.592 --> 18:16.163
WHAT?

18:16.196 --> 18:18.498
YOU KNOW WHAT, GUYS?

18:18.531 --> 18:21.701
I'M NOT AN IDIOT. I KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON HERE.

18:21.734 --> 18:25.138
YOU TWO ARE ONE OF THOSE
CREEPY COUPLES THAT SPLITS UP

18:25.172 --> 18:26.673
AND KEEPS LIVING TOGETHER.

18:26.706 --> 18:29.709
- YES, BUSTED.
- NO NO, WE'RE NOT.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.711
LOOK, I AM TELLING
HER THE TRUTH.

18:31.744 --> 18:35.682
OKAY, LOOK. ALL RIGHT,
THE TRUTH IS...

18:35.715 --> 18:37.817
OUR MORTGAGE IS UPSIDE-DOWN AND
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO MOVE OUT.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.719
WILL YOU STOP IT? THAT
IS NOT THE TRUTH.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.688
LOOK, I SHOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU FROM DAY ONE.

18:41.721 --> 18:44.191
I WANTED TO. I LIKE YOU A LOT.
HERE IT IS.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.259
I AM THE NANNY, OKAY?

18:46.293 --> 18:48.728
I TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS.
I COOK THE MEALS.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.798
I LIVE IN HER HOUSE.
THERE IT IS.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.801
OH MY GOD. NANNY?

18:54.834 --> 18:56.469
YEAH.

18:56.503 --> 19:00.207
YOU REALLY EXPECT ME TO
BELIEVE A LAME LIE LIKE THAT?

19:00.240 --> 19:02.375
- CREEPY!
- WAIT A MINUTE.

19:02.409 --> 19:04.277
LIZ, I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

19:04.311 --> 19:07.347
LIZ, I WAS PART OF A HUGE
GLOBAL FINANCIAL SCAM.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.616
IT'S THE ONLY JOB
I COULD GET, LIZ.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.851
AH! I'D GO TO.

19:15.755 --> 19:19.692
NO ONE IN THIS HOUSE WILL
EVER SEE WAFFLES AGAIN.

19:19.726 --> 19:22.729
- FIGURATIVELY?
- PERMANENTLY!

19:25.798 --> 19:28.735
WELL, I THOUGHT I WAS
VERY BELIEVABLE.

19:30.770 --> 19:34.274
- DON'T YOU LOVE AUDITS?
- I HATE LOOKING AT RECEIPTS.

19:34.307 --> 19:38.211
IT'S LIKE FUN I HAD IN THE
PAST THAT I HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

19:38.245 --> 19:40.513
HEY, IF YOU OFFERED YOUR
FRIEND LIZ A BRIBE,

19:40.547 --> 19:41.781
DO YOU THINK WE WRITE THAT OFF?

19:41.814 --> 19:43.550
SURE, WHY NOT?

19:43.583 --> 19:46.286
AND I COULD WRITE OFF ANY
CHANCE FOR REELECTION.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.655
OH LOOK, IT'S A RECEIPT PARTY.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.490
SHOULD I GET A KEG?

19:52.792 --> 19:55.262
HEY, JOE, I JUST WANTED TO SAY

19:55.295 --> 19:57.163
I'M SORRY THAT THINGS
DIDN'T WORK OUT WITH LIZ.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.732
I PROMISE, NO MORE HELP
WITH YOUR DATING LIFE.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.734
BUT IT WENT SO WELL.

20:01.768 --> 20:04.471
LOOK, I KNOW THAT BEING MY NANNY

20:04.504 --> 20:06.473
ISN'T EXACTLY YOUR
FANTASY CAREER,

20:06.506 --> 20:09.709
BUT I REALLY REALLY LOVE MY JOB.

20:09.742 --> 20:13.546
AND YOUR POINT IS THAT AT LEAST
ONE GETS TO LIVE THE DREAM?

20:13.580 --> 20:15.782
NO, MY POINT IS THAT

20:15.815 --> 20:17.250
IF I DIDN'T HAVE
YOU TO COUNT ON,

20:17.284 --> 20:19.419
I COULDN'T GO TO WORK EVERY
DAY AND DO WHAT I LOVE.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.621
SO THANK YOU.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.590
REALLY.

20:23.623 --> 20:26.259

OKAY, SO LOOK. I'M
JUST GONNA SAY THIS.

I AM A NANNY AND
I'M PROUD OF IT.

21:04.731 --> 21:06.566

IN THE WORLD, BUT IT'S MY JOB,

21:06.599 --> 21:08.234

ANYTHING UNMANLY ABOUT WHAT I DO?
