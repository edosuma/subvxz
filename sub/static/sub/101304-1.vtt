03:15.417 --> 03:17.593
What the fuck
are you doing?

03:17.720 --> 03:20.696
Fuck you!

03:24.568 --> 03:26.073
Oh, my God!

03:27.161 --> 03:30.937
Stop! Stop!

04:58.265 --> 04:59.801
<i>Good morning to you all.</i>

04:59.929 --> 05:01.241
<i>Good morning out there.</i>

05:01.368 --> 05:02.649
<i>Good morning to all of you.</i>

05:02.777 --> 05:04.473
<i>On this Monday...
Yeah, it's Monday.</i>

05:04.601 --> 05:06.200
<i>A case of the Mondays.</i>

05:10.393 --> 05:12.569
<i>I am on my third
cup of coffee.</i>

05:12.697 --> 05:15.321
<i>Anybody else having
a hard time this morning?</i>

05:18.073 --> 05:21.817
<i>Drivers are expected to
experience record congestion today.</i>

05:21.945 --> 05:25.113
<i>Around 100
workers are losing their jobs.</i>

05:25.241 --> 05:27.001
<i>Are you feeling
stressed out these days?</i>

05:27.129 --> 05:28.697
<i>Hey, guess what?
Join the club.</i>

05:28.825 --> 05:30.393
<i>Violent altercations
can happen</i>

05:30.521 --> 05:33.657
<i>from even the most
minor lapses by drivers.</i>

05:34.968 --> 05:38.169
<i>I've posted every day,
ten times a day, for three years now.</i>

05:38.904 --> 05:41.401
<i>Too many people out
there think they can multitask</i>

05:41.529 --> 05:42.969
<i>while operating a vehicle.</i>

05:45.785 --> 05:47.865
<i>Incivility
is a major issue in America.</i>

05:47.993 --> 05:49.753
<i>Rudeness can breed
more rudeness.</i>

05:49.881 --> 05:51.545
<i>We were born angry.</i>

05:51.673 --> 05:53.689
<i>And with anger
comes a lack of self-control.</i>

05:53.817 --> 05:56.633
<i>When you're very angry,
you lose a lot of self-control.</i>

05:58.393 --> 06:01.113
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.633
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my God.

06:04.760 --> 06:06.233
Oh, my God!

06:08.153 --> 06:10.456
<i>Aggressive driving's been
on the rise for several years,</i>

06:10.584 --> 06:12.697
<i>and that's due
to societies moving faster...</i>

06:12.825 --> 06:15.737
<i>Road-rage
fatalities have skyrocketed 500%.</i>

06:17.657 --> 06:20.793
<i>A simple ride-share
trip yesterday took a horrific turn.</i>

06:20.921 --> 06:23.064
<i>Local law
enforcement is understaffed</i>

06:23.193 --> 06:24.665
<i>with no new applicants
in sight.</i>

06:24.793 --> 06:26.265
<i>It's getting
real bad out there.</i>

06:26.393 --> 06:27.832
<i>People are taking matters
into their own hands.</i>

06:27.961 --> 06:29.656
<i>Seeing this live right now.</i>

06:29.784 --> 06:31.833
<i>The police have him cornered.
We're in the middle of a standoff here.</i>

06:31.961 --> 06:33.817
I knew it wasn't
going to end well.

06:34.201 --> 06:35.897
<i>You gotta
protect yourself these days.</i>

06:36.025 --> 06:37.305
<i>No one else
is gonna help you.</i>

06:37.945 --> 06:40.505
<i>We've been married
15 years, we have three kids,</i>

06:40.633 --> 06:42.777
<i>and my husband's been
cheating on me for years.</i>

06:42.905 --> 06:44.792
<i>A man who is
thought to be the main suspect...</i>

06:44.921 --> 06:47.577
<i>Issues surrounding mental
health are increasing by the day.</i>

06:47.705 --> 06:50.233
<i>Inequality is pushing
us farther and farther apart.</i>

06:50.361 --> 06:52.217
<i>We are going backwards.</i>

06:52.345 --> 06:54.265
<i>Thousands of police
officers have been laid off since...</i>

06:54.392 --> 06:56.473
<i>It's a nationwide
epidemic right now.</i>

06:56.600 --> 06:59.480
<i>It could be years before
they can afford to hire more officers.</i>

06:59.609 --> 07:01.017
<i>...searching for a suspect...</i>

07:01.145 --> 07:03.065
<i>Gas prices
were up 82 cents today.</i>

07:03.193 --> 07:05.785
<i>Ambulance
response rates are slowing down.</i>

07:05.912 --> 07:07.961
<i>Stress levels
are at an all-time high.</i>

07:08.088 --> 07:10.905
<i>...all the warning
signs of impending collapse.</i>

07:11.033 --> 07:13.465
<i>When we reach our
boiling point and we explode...</i>

07:13.592 --> 07:15.641
<i>In the streets
with counter-protestors.</i>

07:15.768 --> 07:17.753
- <i>We blame the media, Twitter, Facebook.</i>
- <i>We feel all that strain...</i>

07:17.881 --> 07:19.673
<i>It's definitely
a problem that we're facing...</i>

07:19.801 --> 07:21.017
<i>Takes a toll
on your relationships.</i>

07:21.145 --> 07:22.809
<i>...your health
and well-being.</i>

07:22.937 --> 07:25.112
<i>Why is everything
filled with such garbage?</i>

07:25.241 --> 07:26.937
<i>People have
so much coming at them,</i>

07:27.065 --> 07:29.017
<i>their brains
just can't handle it.</i>

07:57.656 --> 07:58.585
Andy?

07:58.712 --> 08:00.345
<i>Hello. You up?</i>

08:00.825 --> 08:03.385
I am now.

08:03.512 --> 08:07.352
<i>Well, that's good, 'cause your
soon-to-be ex filed another motion.</i>

08:09.209 --> 08:10.745
What's he want now?

08:13.209 --> 08:14.585
Just say it.

08:14.713 --> 08:17.081
<i>He wants the house.</i>

08:17.497 --> 08:20.601
Of course he does.

08:20.729 --> 08:23.225
<i>Listen, I'm already
drawing up our objection.</i>

08:25.145 --> 08:27.929
Shit.
I didn't set my alarm.

08:28.345 --> 08:31.641
<i>Hey, I just need you
to tell me to file it, okay?</i>

08:32.633 --> 08:34.937
- <i>Rach?</i>
- I need to think about it.

08:35.065 --> 08:36.569
<i>What?</i>

08:36.697 --> 08:38.009
<i>Come on.</i>

08:38.617 --> 08:40.473
I just want this
to be over.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.776
<i>Rachel, you need to fight
this, and you know that.</i>

08:42.905 --> 08:44.889
<i>Come on. Richard didn't work
for the house. You did.</i>

08:47.161 --> 08:48.697
Hey, I gotta go.

08:48.826 --> 08:51.512
<i>Okay, but we're continuing
this conversation at lunch.</i>

08:51.641 --> 08:52.889
Yeah. You're the best.

08:53.017 --> 08:54.361
- <i>I know it.</i>
- Bye.

08:54.489 --> 08:56.153
Shouldn't you be dressed?

08:57.017 --> 09:00.281
What, this is not appropriate
attire for your personal chauffeur?

09:00.408 --> 09:03.353
- You have a client.
- No, I don't.

09:06.393 --> 09:08.665
I mean, yes, I do.
But, you know, we're still good.

09:08.792 --> 09:11.320
- It just means we've got...
- Another tardy.

09:11.449 --> 09:13.049
No, we're good.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.225
Okay?

09:15.353 --> 09:18.137
Yeah. No, I know.

09:18.265 --> 09:20.568
I... I get it.
I know you don't like living there,

09:20.697 --> 09:24.408
but it's an assisted-living community,
Mom, it's not an old folks' home.

09:26.041 --> 09:28.504
Can you hear me? Can you...

09:29.816 --> 09:31.545
Okay, Mom, you need...
I can't hear you.

09:31.673 --> 09:33.913
You need to press the little
microphone button. It's...

09:34.041 --> 09:36.057
<i>...firefighters battle
a raging house fire...</i>

09:36.184 --> 09:37.465
Mom, you need to...

09:38.360 --> 09:40.857
You need to press the little
microphone button with the...

09:40.984 --> 09:44.473
I don't know if you can hear me.
I'm gonna come see you later, okay?

09:44.601 --> 09:46.297
Um... Bye.

09:46.426 --> 09:49.049
<i>Police are actively searching now
for the homeowner's ex-husband,</i>

09:49.177 --> 09:52.409
<i>who was last seen fleeing the scene in
a gray pickup truck early this morning.</i>

09:52.537 --> 09:54.393
<i>Our own Pat Davereaux
spoke with a neighbor</i>

09:54.520 --> 09:57.560
<i>about the suspect's history
of substance abuse and violence</i>

09:57.689 --> 09:58.842
<i>after a workplace injury.</i>

09:58.968 --> 10:00.888
<i>She had
a restraining order on him.</i>

10:01.017 --> 10:02.233
<i>And now she's gone.</i>

10:02.360 --> 10:04.313
<i>He just couldn't face it.</i>

10:04.441 --> 10:07.097
- I was watching that.
- It's way too early for real life, dude.

10:07.225 --> 10:09.113
Anybody seen
my candy-cane scissors?

10:09.241 --> 10:12.249
Now, why would you
want to cut candy canes?

10:12.601 --> 10:14.777
You know.
My scissors with the...

10:17.050 --> 10:18.713
Never mind.

10:19.865 --> 10:21.177
Is she okay?

10:21.560 --> 10:22.681
I think so.

10:23.961 --> 10:25.561
Gonna be late again.

10:25.690 --> 10:26.873
Found 'em.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.953
Under one of your
piles of trash.

10:29.080 --> 10:31.801
Hey, science has proven

10:31.929 --> 10:34.681
that piles are the most
efficient filing system.

10:34.809 --> 10:36.441
I read that somewhere.

10:36.568 --> 10:38.136
Those are actually
my coupons.

10:38.713 --> 10:40.248
- Were you cutting us coupons?
- Mm-hmm.

10:40.377 --> 10:42.073
- I love you.
- Mm.

10:43.066 --> 10:46.937
Rachel, maybe you could learn a thing or
two from Mary about fiscal responsibility.

10:49.944 --> 10:52.249
- Rachel, I... I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

10:52.761 --> 10:55.577
I really love having you
and my brother here.

10:56.793 --> 10:59.000
But if you're so
fiscally responsible,

10:59.129 --> 11:01.016
maybe it's time to kick in
some rent here.

11:01.145 --> 11:04.217
Rachel, you're the one that said
that we couldn't stay at Mom's.

11:04.344 --> 11:06.680
We need to sell it.
And you know that. Okay?

11:07.193 --> 11:10.360
I can't afford to pay for her
care, and you really can't either.

11:10.489 --> 11:13.465
No, no, I told you,
I'm working on the business

11:13.592 --> 11:15.257
and it's gonna start soon.

11:15.385 --> 11:17.626
Come on, Freddy,
we gotta be real.

11:17.753 --> 11:19.064
Real about what?

11:19.673 --> 11:21.593
What does that even mean?

11:21.721 --> 11:23.864
She was getting lost
in her own neighborhood.

11:23.993 --> 11:26.713
But to be fair,
I still get lost in our old neighborhood.

11:27.193 --> 11:29.050
- Even with a phone?
- Yeah.

11:29.177 --> 11:32.217
Yeah, the streets in Linwood Springs
are like a freakin' maze of spaghetti.

11:32.344 --> 11:35.161
Kyle, grab a granola bar.
We gotta go.

11:35.576 --> 11:36.632
I already ate.

11:36.762 --> 11:38.841
Bye, guys.
See you after school.

11:38.968 --> 11:41.209
See you, dude.
Blow it up in there.

11:42.457 --> 11:43.672
Bye, buddy.

11:45.592 --> 11:47.129
Morning, Rachel.
Hey, Kyle.

11:47.257 --> 11:49.945
Morning, Rosie. New ride?

11:50.072 --> 11:51.066
Yeah. We've gone minivan.

11:51.193 --> 11:52.697
It suits you.

11:56.440 --> 11:57.433
Bye.

12:06.969 --> 12:08.506
Are we ever
gonna get a new ride?

12:08.632 --> 12:09.944
Sure.

12:11.512 --> 12:13.080
You wanna buy me one?

12:18.776 --> 12:20.121
"Prospective."

12:20.248 --> 12:21.786
Mom, I'm good.

12:22.233 --> 12:24.888
Remember,
it's not "per-spective."

12:25.369 --> 12:26.073
"Prospective."

12:26.200 --> 12:31.482
P-R-O-S-P-E-C-T-I-V-E.

12:31.608 --> 12:33.561
- "Prospective."
- Nice job.

12:39.993 --> 12:43.033
Hey, so what do you say?
Should we risk the freeway today?

12:43.192 --> 12:44.890
No. No freeway.

12:46.008 --> 12:49.177
Okay, well, just check
the traffic for me, please.

12:52.345 --> 12:53.977
You don't have
a pass code anymore?

12:54.104 --> 12:56.377
Not since I almost crashed
trying to unlock it.

12:56.506 --> 12:58.617
Wow. That's not safe.

13:01.050 --> 13:02.970
- "Precarious."
- What?

13:03.384 --> 13:05.464
Next word. "Precarious."

13:06.713 --> 13:11.641
"Precarious."
P-R-E-C-A-R-I-O-U-S.

13:11.770 --> 13:13.433
- Use it in a sentence.
- Uh...

13:13.944 --> 13:19.033
The way the glass is placed on the
edge of the table is precarious.

13:19.160 --> 13:21.210
Nice. Good job.

13:22.393 --> 13:23.737
Says it's clear.

13:23.864 --> 13:26.073
And that's a problem why?

13:26.202 --> 13:28.344
Because we still
can't trust it.

13:30.841 --> 13:33.946
- Sorry, kiddo, but today we must.
- Mom, no!

13:34.072 --> 13:35.961
- I don't have a choice.
- No! Please?

13:36.088 --> 13:37.881
- We're gonna be late.
- Trust me, Kyle.

13:38.008 --> 13:39.353
This is gonna be
quicker, okay?

13:39.481 --> 13:42.361
That's what you said
the last two times.

13:46.777 --> 13:48.697
Hey, see? All clear.

13:53.337 --> 13:55.577
It's Dad.
Can I please talk to him?

13:58.489 --> 14:00.409
- Hey, Dad.
- <i>Hey, man.</i>

14:00.537 --> 14:03.033
Uncle Freddy and I invented
a new Fortnite strategy.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.080
- You wanna hear it?
- <i>Not a good time.</i>

14:05.209 --> 14:06.841
- <i>Maybe later, okay?</i>
- Okay.

14:06.968 --> 14:08.697
You got the tickets
for the game tomorrow?

14:08.824 --> 14:10.456
<i>Yeah, look,
about the game...</i>

14:10.584 --> 14:12.376
<i>My schedule
kind of got messed up,</i>

14:12.504 --> 14:14.584
<i>and my boss needs me
to go out of town tomorrow.</i>

14:14.713 --> 14:16.953
- <i>Next time, okay?</i>
- Yeah, okay.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.297
That's really understanding
of you, Kyle.

14:22.424 --> 14:25.017
You know, new jobs,
like your Dad's, can be...

14:25.881 --> 14:27.961
really unpredictable
at first.

14:28.088 --> 14:29.530
<i>See. That's right.</i>

14:29.656 --> 14:32.281
<i>But I promise we'll make a
plan to go to a game soon...</i>

14:32.410 --> 14:34.744
Well, it probably shouldn't be planned.
It should be more a...

14:34.873 --> 14:36.889
a spur-of-the-moment
thing, right?

14:37.497 --> 14:42.232
I mean, 'cause plans...
can be hard to stick to.

14:42.361 --> 14:43.993
<i>Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</i>

14:44.121 --> 14:47.097
<i>I just need to keep my new boss
happy so I can get my own place...</i>

14:47.224 --> 14:49.434
Yeah, and maybe stop relying
on other sources of income.

14:49.561 --> 14:52.377
<i>Look, I just want
everything to be fair and square, okay?</i>

14:52.506 --> 14:55.513
<i>That's why I called, actually.
I needed to talk to you about moving...</i>

14:55.641 --> 14:57.784
Richard,
we gotta go, okay?

14:58.297 --> 15:00.281
We're just
getting to school.

15:00.408 --> 15:03.001
<i>Okay, fine. But, you
know, this isn't gonna solve itself.</i>

15:03.130 --> 15:05.528
<i>Look, I'm sorry again, bud.
I'll talk to you soon, okay?</i>

15:05.657 --> 15:08.281
- Okay.
- <i>Okay. All right. Bye.</i>

15:08.408 --> 15:10.072
Bye.

15:10.681 --> 15:11.928
Bye.

15:16.506 --> 15:19.129
I am... I'm sorry, Kyle.

15:28.794 --> 15:31.417
Three tardies
is an automatic detention.

15:33.048 --> 15:35.128
I'm doing the best
I can here. Okay?

15:38.457 --> 15:41.144
Seriously?

15:48.697 --> 15:50.457
I can't believe this.

15:56.026 --> 15:57.625
Deborah's calling you.

16:06.137 --> 16:08.888
Deborah. Hey, I was
just gonna call you.

16:09.018 --> 16:12.057
<i>I just wanted to make
sure I was gonna see you at 9:00.</i>

16:12.185 --> 16:15.161
- Absolutely.
- <i>Oh, great. I have a big day today.</i>

16:15.288 --> 16:17.624
Uh... but I've just hit
hellish traffic,

16:17.754 --> 16:21.657
so I'm gonna be 15,
maybe 20 minutes late, tops.

16:21.785 --> 16:23.288
<i>Are you serious?</i>

16:24.378 --> 16:26.137
Actually, you know what?

16:26.617 --> 16:29.144
It looks like
it might be clearing, so...

16:29.721 --> 16:30.904
We're good.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.984
<i>I can't
do this again, Rachel.</i>

16:33.114 --> 16:36.217
<i>You know what? I'm gonna call
Linda's guy and get in there.</i>

16:36.346 --> 16:39.256
<i>I love you, Rachel,
but ever since you lost your salon...</i>

16:39.384 --> 16:42.424
<i>I can't believe I'm gonna say this,
but you're fired. Get your shit together.</i>

16:42.553 --> 16:45.594
Deborah, no, wait. I'm sorry, okay?

16:48.761 --> 16:50.361
Oh, my God.

16:51.481 --> 16:52.952
Are you okay, Mom?

16:54.138 --> 16:55.225
Yeah.

16:56.250 --> 16:57.561
Just...

16:58.105 --> 17:00.090
Oh, my God. Just my...

17:01.177 --> 17:02.874
My best client,
that's all.

17:03.993 --> 17:05.368
I'm sorry.

17:10.104 --> 17:13.048
Eight miles, you know.
That's it.

17:14.137 --> 17:18.904
What takes ten minutes on a Sunday,
takes an hour every other day...

17:19.353 --> 17:20.985
and wrecks your career.

17:21.528 --> 17:22.969
You know why?

17:26.841 --> 17:27.705
Too many cars.

17:27.834 --> 17:31.578
Too many cars
and too many people.

17:32.056 --> 17:34.328
Didn't you also oversleep?

17:38.394 --> 17:40.314
Yes. Yes.

17:41.274 --> 17:44.121
And I overslept.
You're absolutely right.

17:47.257 --> 17:48.568
It's okay.

17:52.344 --> 17:53.689
So...

17:55.066 --> 17:56.538
any suggestions?

17:56.665 --> 17:59.418
You could take the next exit
and do surface streets.

18:02.968 --> 18:04.057
You got it.

18:04.185 --> 18:06.680
Hold on. I'm gonna
get us out of this.

18:10.393 --> 18:12.761
From now on,
no more freeways, okay?

18:12.889 --> 18:16.921
I only trust you,
okay? Deal?

18:17.593 --> 18:18.618
Deal.

19:08.601 --> 19:11.321
It's not getting
any greener.

19:11.801 --> 19:12.761
Come on, man.

19:12.888 --> 19:14.169
Come on!

19:17.433 --> 19:18.521
Go!

19:38.105 --> 19:40.856
No, no. Go.

19:41.530 --> 19:43.704
Oh, come on.

19:44.281 --> 19:46.009
Of course. Yeah.

20:06.937 --> 20:08.473
- Kyle, don't.
- Morning.

20:09.081 --> 20:11.480
I don't even get
a courtesy tap first?

20:12.249 --> 20:13.785
Roll up your window.

20:18.360 --> 20:19.641
It's not working.

20:19.769 --> 20:22.585
You know what
a courtesy tap is, young man?

20:22.713 --> 20:24.345
Just ignore him.

20:26.425 --> 20:28.473
Sounds like this.

20:28.601 --> 20:30.680
It's light. It's friendly.

20:30.808 --> 20:33.049
Just like you're trying
to get somebody's attention.

20:33.592 --> 20:35.353
I'm sure that's what
your mom meant.

20:35.801 --> 20:37.528
Is that right, ma'am?

20:37.657 --> 20:40.473
- Is a courtesy tap what you meant?
- No, it's not.

20:42.232 --> 20:43.481
Why is that?

20:43.609 --> 20:46.168
The light was green,
and you weren't moving.

20:46.297 --> 20:48.984
Mom. Stop it, please.

20:49.113 --> 20:51.289
Some of us
have places to be.

20:53.241 --> 20:56.121
Yeah, I admit to being
a little zoned out back there.

20:58.297 --> 21:00.601
I've been kind of having
a hard time lately.

21:00.729 --> 21:02.585
Yeah, well, join the club.

21:02.937 --> 21:04.376
Stop it.

21:04.505 --> 21:05.913
Well, I'm sorry.

21:07.609 --> 21:10.201
I'm sorry that you are,
and I'm sorry that...

21:10.329 --> 21:12.153
I might've made it worse.

21:14.041 --> 21:16.057
You accept my apology?

21:16.921 --> 21:18.648
Sure, whatever.

21:19.097 --> 21:20.185
Perfect.

21:21.081 --> 21:23.833
If you could just do the same,
we could press reset.

21:24.569 --> 21:26.713
Ma'am, I was saying,
if you could just apologize...

21:26.841 --> 21:28.280
Yeah, I heard you.

21:29.208 --> 21:30.425
And?

21:30.553 --> 21:33.080
I don't have anything
to apologize for, sir.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.577
- Mom. Just apologize.
- It's okay.

21:36.888 --> 21:40.153
Well, I don't think that's really
true of any of us now, is it?

21:41.241 --> 21:43.449
But that's where we are
in this world today.

21:44.345 --> 21:47.673
We seem to have developed a
fundamental inability to apologize

21:47.801 --> 21:50.457
to anyone, for anything.

21:55.929 --> 21:58.649
I don't even think you really
know what a bad day is.

22:02.808 --> 22:04.313
But you're gonna find out.

22:05.817 --> 22:07.576
You hear me, miss?

22:08.281 --> 22:09.849
You're gonna fucking learn.

22:15.545 --> 22:17.593
Hey, can you go, please?

22:17.913 --> 22:19.257
Just go.

22:42.136 --> 22:43.289
Shit.

22:47.833 --> 22:49.017
Mom.

22:52.921 --> 22:55.352
Oh, my gosh! Stop!

23:00.857 --> 23:02.041
Are you okay?

23:02.745 --> 23:03.737
Yeah.

23:04.089 --> 23:05.560
What's this guy's problem?

23:26.937 --> 23:28.248
What's he doing?

23:28.377 --> 23:30.041
Just gonna let
this person go on his way

23:30.168 --> 23:32.217
- and take the back way, okay?
- Okay.

23:35.769 --> 23:38.073
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Is he stopping?

23:38.200 --> 23:39.033
Come on.

23:47.065 --> 23:48.408
Come on.

23:58.073 --> 23:59.641
So that was terrifying.

24:01.657 --> 24:06.392
You know, some people are just
jerks, and that's all there is to it.

24:07.833 --> 24:09.561
Everything's gonna be okay.

24:11.096 --> 24:12.504
I got the window up.

24:21.048 --> 24:24.921
Hey. So, what was that
Fortnite strategy

24:25.049 --> 24:27.065
you and Uncle Freddy
came up with?

24:28.024 --> 24:29.465
You don't care about that.

24:29.593 --> 24:32.312
Of course I do.
I wanna learn.

24:32.729 --> 24:34.169
I wanna learn.

24:36.089 --> 24:39.193
You play duos and glide down to a
place you're really familiar with,

24:39.321 --> 24:40.473
like Retail Row.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.233
And then, one of you
distracts an enemy

24:42.361 --> 24:45.113
while the other speeds a golf
cart out from a hiding place

24:45.241 --> 24:47.097
and crashes into them.

24:50.200 --> 24:52.153
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

24:52.793 --> 24:56.537
You're right, I don't,
but it sounds awesome.

24:57.337 --> 24:59.033
Seriously.

25:24.473 --> 25:25.945
So...

25:26.969 --> 25:28.313
how long's detention?

25:28.825 --> 25:29.945
Thirty minutes.

25:30.424 --> 25:33.625
Okay, so, I'll bail you out
3:30 on the nose,

25:33.752 --> 25:38.937
and I'll even have a big "make it
up to you" Butterfinger Blizzard

25:39.064 --> 25:40.728
ready and waiting.

25:41.529 --> 25:42.937
I promise.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.272
You don't have to promise.

25:45.402 --> 25:46.777
Kyle.

25:47.865 --> 25:50.072
Can you please try
to be on time?

25:50.202 --> 25:51.737
Yeah, of course.

26:19.321 --> 26:21.400
- <i>Rach?</i>
- My nine o'clock fired...

26:25.977 --> 26:28.153
...fired me.
Hey, you...

26:29.273 --> 26:30.457
you still there?

26:30.586 --> 26:32.216
<i>Uh, yeah. What happened?</i>

26:32.601 --> 26:33.945
Oh, God.

26:34.426 --> 26:37.720
Freeway was a parking lot,
and my biggest client couldn't wait,

26:37.849 --> 26:39.800
so she told me
to go to hell.

26:40.090 --> 26:41.816
- <i>That sucks.</i>
- Yeah.

26:41.945 --> 26:45.241
And then some psycho flipped out
on me and Kyle driving to school.

26:46.297 --> 26:48.345
- <i>And all this before noon. Shit.</i>
- Yeah.

26:48.473 --> 26:50.297
<i>At least the day
can't get any worse, huh?</i>

26:50.425 --> 26:53.817
I could really use some therapy
on top of the legal advice.

26:54.586 --> 26:56.089
Can you do breakfast
instead?

26:56.216 --> 26:58.553
<i>Um... at Darrow's?</i>

26:58.873 --> 27:01.464
Yes. Pancake therapy,
even better.

27:01.593 --> 27:02.873
Twenty minutes?

27:03.001 --> 27:05.177
<i>Mm. "Human" 20 minutes,
or "Rachel" 20 minutes?</i>

27:05.304 --> 27:06.649
Ha, ha.

27:06.776 --> 27:07.930
See you in 20.

27:55.801 --> 27:57.817
Thank you.

27:57.946 --> 27:59.193
Thank you.

28:17.880 --> 28:19.224
Thank you.

28:20.826 --> 28:21.913
Cash or credit?

28:22.297 --> 28:24.440
That'll be, uh, $5.33.

28:24.569 --> 28:25.977
Okay. Thank you.

28:26.104 --> 28:29.401
Hi. Can I have five Powerball
Quick Picks? Thanks.

28:29.752 --> 28:31.064
And those.

28:32.216 --> 28:34.904
That'll be $13.31.

28:38.328 --> 28:39.609
A 20...

28:40.057 --> 28:41.304
your tickets...

28:41.720 --> 28:44.217
- Here's your change.
- Thanks.

28:47.737 --> 28:49.113
Okay. Thank you.

28:51.449 --> 28:52.728
What can I get you, sir?

28:53.113 --> 28:56.216
- Just a pack of Ventti gold.
- That'll be all?

28:56.888 --> 28:58.969
- That's it.
- All right. Cash or credit?

29:00.408 --> 29:01.688
Okay.

29:08.922 --> 29:10.104
Hi.

29:12.570 --> 29:14.297
Uh, ma'am, are you okay?

29:14.425 --> 29:15.897
Yeah. Uh...

29:18.841 --> 29:20.346
Actually, no. I...

29:20.824 --> 29:23.448
I'm pretty sure the guy
in that truck's following me.

29:23.577 --> 29:25.050
He somebody you know?

29:25.177 --> 29:29.017
No, we... we kind of exchanged
words at an intersection.

29:29.146 --> 29:30.970
I honked my horn at him,
and now he's...

29:31.096 --> 29:32.600
He's road-raging you.

29:33.112 --> 29:34.681
You could say that.

29:34.810 --> 29:36.505
- You want me to call the cops?
- Nah, that'll take all day.

29:36.633 --> 29:38.457
Besides, that'll just
piss him off even more.

29:38.586 --> 29:39.801
Might. Might not.

29:39.928 --> 29:41.784
Look, I can call 'em.

29:41.913 --> 29:43.641
I don't know. I'm probably
just being paranoid.

29:43.768 --> 29:44.888
How 'bout I walk out
with you?

29:45.561 --> 29:48.282
- You don't have to do that.
- I'm heading out there anyway.

29:49.177 --> 29:51.864
- So, you think he's...
- He's just trying to scare you.

29:51.993 --> 29:54.136
If he sees both of us together,
and he doesn't drive off,

29:54.264 --> 29:55.544
you still
get in your car.

29:55.673 --> 29:57.112
I make sure
I get his plates.

29:57.241 --> 30:00.057
If he follows you out,
we'll all call the cops.

30:00.793 --> 30:04.249
Okay. Thanks.
I appreciate it.

30:24.473 --> 30:27.736
Why don't you just get in the car?
I'm gonna grab his plates.

30:40.216 --> 30:42.457
711 TPX.

30:43.192 --> 30:44.986
711 TPX.

30:45.112 --> 30:46.457
Thanks.

30:50.457 --> 30:51.610
Hey.

30:52.249 --> 30:54.808
Why don't you just chill, man?
Go your own way.

31:09.304 --> 31:11.641
It's a smart move
staying put, bro.

31:13.304 --> 31:15.064
I got your plate
right here.

31:22.584 --> 31:24.057
Hey, hey, hey!

31:24.186 --> 31:25.401
Hey, hey, hey!

31:35.384 --> 31:36.313
Oh...

31:37.786 --> 31:40.184
Oh, God.

31:44.217 --> 31:45.657
Where's my phone?

32:37.306 --> 32:38.778
Shit.

32:43.545 --> 32:46.104
Hey. Hey!

32:57.177 --> 32:58.233
Come on.

33:04.344 --> 33:05.689
Fuck.

33:21.305 --> 33:22.969
Oh, God.

33:34.649 --> 33:36.121
Oh, shit.

33:50.137 --> 33:51.416
Shit, shit.

34:02.872 --> 34:05.017
What? That's
my fucking phone.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.273
Oh, God.
What's wrong with you?

34:22.232 --> 34:23.385
What are you doing, bitch?

34:23.514 --> 34:24.826
I'm sorry.

34:24.952 --> 34:26.265
What's wrong with you?
"Sorry, sorry."

34:26.394 --> 34:28.057
- I'm sorry, okay?
- It's a fucking one-way street.

34:28.185 --> 34:28.984
Move!

34:29.113 --> 34:30.680
- Fuck you, bitch!
- Move!

34:31.161 --> 34:33.241
- "Sorry." You coming in here...
- Sorry, okay?

34:33.370 --> 34:34.712
Learn how to drive!

34:34.841 --> 34:36.921
- This is not how you drive.
- Sorry.

34:37.049 --> 34:38.233
Fuck you!

34:38.552 --> 34:39.897
Dumb bitch!

35:15.896 --> 35:17.241
Oh, God.

35:23.801 --> 35:25.368
<i>Hi, it's Rachel.
Just leave a message.</i>

35:25.496 --> 35:28.376
Hey, Rach. Just calling to see what's up.

35:28.505 --> 35:31.705
Please call or text
with an ETA. Thanks.

35:50.937 --> 35:52.312
Are you Andy?

35:52.825 --> 35:53.849
Uh, yeah.

35:54.361 --> 35:55.609
I'm Tom Cooper.

35:56.697 --> 35:58.936
- I'm an old friend of Rachel's.
- Oh, hey.

35:59.064 --> 36:02.745
Huh. That makes two of us.
Uh, have we met?

36:03.033 --> 36:06.712
No, I, uh... I just moved
to town a couple weeks ago.

36:06.841 --> 36:08.664
Rachel told me
she was meeting you here.

36:08.793 --> 36:11.512
Yeah. Well, you know what?
She's very, very late.

36:11.865 --> 36:14.456
Well, she asked me
to apologize.

36:15.097 --> 36:18.296
But it's hard to tell the level
of sincerity in that, isn't it?

36:18.777 --> 36:21.080
- Uh, when did you talk to her?
- Ten minutes ago.

36:21.208 --> 36:23.418
Okay. So, she's okay?
Everything's okay?

36:23.992 --> 36:26.233
Well, Andy,
to tell you the truth...

36:27.321 --> 36:29.497
she sounded
a little stressed.

36:29.625 --> 36:31.225
She's got plenty
of reasons to be.

36:31.353 --> 36:33.560
Yeah, yeah.
The divorce...

36:34.361 --> 36:36.249
the salon, her mother.

36:36.376 --> 36:40.312
Plus, she said some guy road-raged
on her pretty hard this morning.

36:40.857 --> 36:42.425
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:45.817 --> 36:50.425
About a year ago, a guy followed me
for about ten miles on my bumper.

36:50.776 --> 36:52.121
Scary.

36:53.497 --> 36:55.353
They follow me
all the time.

36:58.456 --> 36:59.673
Yeah?

37:00.633 --> 37:01.753
You should be careful.

37:02.169 --> 37:04.825
You never know who you could
be driving next to, right?

37:04.953 --> 37:08.184
Or who you might end up
married to.

37:08.313 --> 37:09.689
How do you mean?

37:11.960 --> 37:14.969
You said she was stressed
because of her divorce.

37:15.864 --> 37:17.688
No, actually you said that.

37:18.809 --> 37:20.696
- Yeah? Oh.
- Yeah.

37:21.785 --> 37:23.833
She let me listen
to his voice mails.

37:24.504 --> 37:27.033
You know? I mean...

37:28.793 --> 37:31.289
That guy sounds like
he's doing his best.

37:31.737 --> 37:34.233
Well, the man's quit
every job he's ever had.

37:34.617 --> 37:36.281
- Is that his biggest crime?
- No.

37:36.409 --> 37:38.904
Did he fuck around on her?
Anything like that?

37:39.481 --> 37:41.369
He's just miserable.

37:43.321 --> 37:45.913
Kind of like my 11:00 appointment's
gonna be if I show up late.

37:46.041 --> 37:48.504
Listen, since you're
having better luck with Rachel,

37:48.633 --> 37:50.809
can you just tell her
to call me, please?

37:52.089 --> 37:53.465
Now, Counselor...

37:54.745 --> 37:57.144
if I could get Rachel
on the phone...

37:58.072 --> 38:00.281
would you buy me
a cup of coffee?

38:02.585 --> 38:03.864
And if she doesn't pick up?

38:03.993 --> 38:07.097
Well, then I guess
I owe you a cup of coffee.

38:07.225 --> 38:08.217
Uh...

38:10.265 --> 38:11.480
Okay.

38:19.481 --> 38:20.281
Oh, God.

38:34.265 --> 38:35.513
What?

38:37.081 --> 38:37.977
Where is...

38:38.105 --> 38:39.513
Oh, God.

38:50.681 --> 38:52.217
What?

38:59.993 --> 39:01.112
Andy?

39:02.137 --> 39:03.865
Are you serious?

39:05.113 --> 39:06.393
Rach?

39:06.745 --> 39:07.865
<i>Andy?</i>

39:08.473 --> 39:10.745
I'm sitting here, and I'm
waiting for you. What's...

39:10.873 --> 39:14.041
<i>I-I don't... Whose phone is this?
I don't understand.</i>

39:14.521 --> 39:15.833
How did you...

39:15.961 --> 39:18.073
<i>Rach, are you there?</i>

39:18.809 --> 39:20.441
<i>Are you
at Darrow's right now?</i>

39:20.568 --> 39:24.025
Yeah, yeah. I'm sitting here
right across from your friend Tom.

39:24.601 --> 39:25.977
- Cooper.
- Tom Cooper...

39:26.105 --> 39:28.185
who apparently has an easier
time getting hold of you

39:28.313 --> 39:30.649
than your
best friend/free lawyer.

39:31.832 --> 39:34.169
I don't know a Tom Cooper.

39:34.489 --> 39:36.153
<i>Tom Cooper,
who just moved to town,</i>

39:36.280 --> 39:38.521
who you told to apologize
to me for being late.

39:38.649 --> 39:41.209
Nice guy. Sweet beard.

39:41.881 --> 39:43.769
Hey, listen to me.

39:45.401 --> 39:47.161
He's not a friend, okay.

39:47.481 --> 39:50.617
<i>He's the psycho who came
after me today. Oh, God.</i>

39:52.473 --> 39:56.184
I just watched him run over
someone at a gas station.

39:56.729 --> 40:00.377
<i>Andy, do you hear me?
Are you there?</i>

40:00.505 --> 40:03.961
No, you're gonna have to say that
again, Rachel. You're breaking up.

40:06.553 --> 40:08.345
What the hell
are you doing?

40:08.825 --> 40:09.945
I'm just here with Andy.

40:10.073 --> 40:12.377
Hey, if she's almost here,
I can wait.

40:12.793 --> 40:15.737
Who says if you're
almost here, he can wait.

40:16.793 --> 40:17.881
What do you want?

40:18.009 --> 40:20.985
No, it's not what I want.
It's what I need.

40:21.689 --> 40:24.121
And I need you to learn
what a bad day really is,

40:24.249 --> 40:26.456
and I need you to learn
how to say you're sorry.

40:26.585 --> 40:28.089
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

40:28.217 --> 40:29.944
<i>I'm sorry. Okay?
There, I said it.</i>

40:30.073 --> 40:32.153
No, how to say you're sorry
and actually fucking mean it.

40:32.281 --> 40:34.777
- Whoa, Tom.
- And this is the beginning of that first lesson.

40:34.905 --> 40:36.377
- Can I have my phone back?
- No.

40:36.504 --> 40:38.201
- <i>Leave him alone.</i>
- Just give me my phone.

40:39.001 --> 40:42.073
<i>Andy?
What's happening?</i>

40:43.384 --> 40:44.569
What's happening?

40:47.897 --> 40:50.585
- You're on speaker now, Rachel.
- Call the police!

40:50.713 --> 40:52.728
- <i>Andy.</i>
- Someone stop him!

40:52.857 --> 40:55.097
<i>Andy.</i>

40:56.216 --> 40:59.352
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- He is not okay. You hear me?

40:59.737 --> 41:01.464
- You hear me?
- <i>Yes.</i>

41:02.266 --> 41:03.449
I hear you.

41:03.577 --> 41:05.081
<i>Who is Andy?</i>

41:05.529 --> 41:08.729
Is he really your best
friend/scumbag divorce lawyer?

41:08.857 --> 41:10.616
- What?
- <i>Yeah?</i>

41:11.353 --> 41:14.200
<i>The kind of person who fucks over
men like me and Richard for a living?</i>

41:14.329 --> 41:15.545
Come on. Please.

41:15.673 --> 41:18.713
<i>He doesn't do that, okay?
He's a decent guy.</i>

41:18.841 --> 41:20.409
Is that right?

41:20.537 --> 41:21.784
There's a divorce lawyer...

41:22.232 --> 41:24.281
who doesn't fuck over
decent men for a living?

41:24.408 --> 41:27.449
I find that very hard to believe, Rachel!

41:27.577 --> 41:29.497
Very hard!

41:29.625 --> 41:31.897
<i>What is this?
Is this some kind of sick joke?</i>

41:32.344 --> 41:35.576
- <i>Are you having sex with him?</i>
- What are you talking about?

41:35.705 --> 41:38.297
'Cause these guys, they don't
get in trouble for that.

41:38.425 --> 41:40.409
They'll fuck you
all kinds of ways.

41:40.537 --> 41:43.704
Fuck you physically, fuck you
emotionally, fuck you financially.

41:43.833 --> 41:45.689
And they don't get
in trouble for it.

41:45.817 --> 41:48.217
Has he been fucking you, Rachel?
Has he been fucking you?

41:48.346 --> 41:49.401
He's married, okay?

41:49.529 --> 41:51.737
That don't mean shit
these days.

41:51.865 --> 41:53.113
<i>Just leave him alone.</i>

41:53.464 --> 41:55.513
Hey, Rachel, if you knew
this was gonna be

41:55.640 --> 41:58.745
the very last time you could ever
talk to your lifelong friend Andy,

41:58.873 --> 42:00.121
what would you say?

42:00.249 --> 42:01.881
Wait. No, wait. What?

42:02.009 --> 42:03.545
What would you say,
Rachel?

42:05.017 --> 42:07.482
<i>Andy?
Hey, what's happening?</i>

42:08.057 --> 42:09.402
<i>What's happening?</i>

42:09.528 --> 42:11.513
- That was a wasted opportunity.
- <i>Wait!</i>

42:17.785 --> 42:19.097
<i>Andy?</i>

42:19.545 --> 42:20.440
<i>Andy?</i>

42:20.922 --> 42:24.184
<i>Andy, are you there?</i>
He can't hear you no more.

42:26.650 --> 42:28.024
What do you mean?

42:30.586 --> 42:32.089
Well, I think you know.

42:32.857 --> 42:35.993
<i>No, I don't.
I don't, I don't. What did you do?</i>

42:36.121 --> 42:37.528
What did you do?

42:37.945 --> 42:40.217
Well, why don't you
get yourself to a TV.

42:40.825 --> 42:42.905
Gonna be a lot
of video soon.

42:43.417 --> 42:45.177
<i>You put him on the phone.</i>

42:45.625 --> 42:47.128
<i>You put him back
on this goddamn phone.</i>

42:47.257 --> 42:49.369
You put him back
on this goddamn phone!

42:49.496 --> 42:51.193
No, I can't do that.

42:54.073 --> 42:55.193
Why not?

42:55.321 --> 42:56.953
<i>Well, number one...</i>

43:01.016 --> 43:02.553
he's already dead.

43:04.281 --> 43:05.657
No, he's not.

43:06.680 --> 43:07.769
No, he's...

43:08.153 --> 43:09.721
Hey, listen, listen.

43:11.320 --> 43:13.017
I'm really sorry, okay?

43:13.529 --> 43:15.737
- <i>I'm really sorry.</i>
- You know...

43:15.864 --> 43:19.000
I can still hear that faint tinge
of "fuck you" in your voice.

43:19.482 --> 43:22.169
Never know it, but nothing's ever
your good goddamn fault, right?

43:25.753 --> 43:26.809
Hello?

43:31.993 --> 43:33.433
Oh, shit.

43:34.073 --> 43:35.384
Oh, shit.

43:35.802 --> 43:38.489
Oh, my God.

44:11.704 --> 44:14.521
Your life is over
when they find you.

44:14.649 --> 44:16.760
Suicide by cop's
okay with me.

44:16.889 --> 44:19.097
What do you want?

44:19.224 --> 44:21.593
<i>You got some messages.
Got one from Dr. Miller.</i>

44:21.720 --> 44:24.409
She wants to change your
Friday therapy appointment.

44:25.017 --> 44:28.473
She better bring her A-game,
'cause you're gonna fucking need it.

44:33.528 --> 44:37.049
<i>Got one here from the principal of
the Wesley Oaks Elementary School.</i>

44:37.177 --> 44:41.113
"Rachel, thank you for your hair and
makeup for <i>The Music Man</i> production.

44:41.241 --> 44:42.680
Kyle was great
in the quartet."

44:43.930 --> 44:45.464
<i>Is that your son's name?</i>

44:46.008 --> 44:47.641
<i>Is that where
he goes to school?</i>

44:48.601 --> 44:49.944
No way.

44:53.305 --> 44:57.017
Kyle's my friend's son.
My son doesn't go to Wesley...

44:57.145 --> 45:01.016
Rachel, I'm scrolling through
the pictures on your phone.

45:01.146 --> 45:02.457
Don't be a fucking idiot.

45:02.584 --> 45:04.186
Don't you touch my son!

45:04.312 --> 45:07.033
<i>Then tell me,
who's gonna die next, Rachel?</i>

45:07.161 --> 45:08.121
<i>Who's gonna die?</i>

45:08.248 --> 45:09.817
<i>Give me a name,</i>

45:09.946 --> 45:13.433
or I'll just play Russian
roulette with your contact list.

45:14.137 --> 45:15.768
<i>No. I can't.</i>

45:17.593 --> 45:18.616
What about Richard?

45:18.744 --> 45:20.153
No! No.

45:20.281 --> 45:22.552
You telling me there's still
some feelings there?

45:22.681 --> 45:24.793
He's my son's father.
Okay?

45:24.920 --> 45:28.216
- <i>You can't ask me to do that.</i>
- You know what I can do?

45:28.344 --> 45:31.993
I can send the $2300 and change
you've got in your checking account

45:32.121 --> 45:33.433
straight to Richard.

45:35.128 --> 45:36.505
And...

45:36.633 --> 45:39.160
every goddamn cent you've got
in your savings account.

45:39.610 --> 45:40.888
You got me a name yet?

45:44.442 --> 45:46.105
<i>Look, here's an idea.</i>

45:46.233 --> 45:49.593
<i>How about I swing by your mom's room
at the Shady Falls nursing home?</i>

45:50.073 --> 45:52.824
Right after I burn your house
to the fucking ground.

45:53.272 --> 45:56.344
Me. Me, okay? I choose me.

45:56.857 --> 45:57.976
<i>I choose me.</i>

45:58.936 --> 46:03.385
Well, that's very noble,
but you can't choose yourself.

46:03.513 --> 46:04.888
<i>Why not?</i>

46:05.017 --> 46:07.386
Because that would defeat
the fucking purpose, Rachel.

46:07.513 --> 46:09.657
Give me a name.
Make a choice.

46:09.784 --> 46:12.281
<i>Who are you
gonna kill next?</i>

46:12.664 --> 46:14.937
<i>Your mom? Richard?</i>

46:15.066 --> 46:16.186
<i>Kyle?</i>

46:16.312 --> 46:18.810
Deb... Deborah.

46:19.224 --> 46:20.440
Last name?

46:20.890 --> 46:22.137
<i>Haskell.</i>

46:24.088 --> 46:26.297
8277 Walnut Avenue?

46:27.032 --> 46:29.080
Now, what was her sin,
Rachel?

46:30.169 --> 46:31.608
She fired me.

46:32.217 --> 46:34.521
<i>Through no fault
of yours, I'm sure.</i>

46:34.840 --> 46:36.472
<i>I gave you a name.</i>

46:37.017 --> 46:38.041
Yeah, you did.

46:38.521 --> 46:41.146
So, you won't hurt my son...

46:41.560 --> 46:43.544
<i>or my mom,
or go to my house?</i>

46:43.674 --> 46:44.634
Not right now.

46:44.761 --> 46:47.449
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick.

46:48.633 --> 46:50.200
Don't lose that phone, Rachel.

46:51.128 --> 46:52.153
Yeah.

47:10.713 --> 47:12.344
Fuck. Fuck.

47:20.024 --> 47:21.049
Okay.

47:28.537 --> 47:30.392
<i>911.
What's your emergency?</i>

47:30.520 --> 47:33.208
My name is Rachel Flynn.
I have multiple emergencies.

47:33.337 --> 47:35.896
I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

47:37.881 --> 47:40.696
<i>Police say the
suspect didn't even bat an eye</i>

47:40.824 --> 47:44.728
<i>as security cameras and graphic video
from terrified customers' cell phones</i>

47:44.857 --> 47:49.720
<i>captured him brutally assaulting and
then killing the victim in a booth.</i>

47:49.849 --> 47:53.081
<i>He can then be seen calmly
walking out of Darrow's Diner</i>

47:53.208 --> 47:54.553
<i>while talking on a cell phone.</i>

47:54.681 --> 47:57.625
<i>Witnesses say he sped away
in a gray pickup...</i>

47:57.753 --> 48:01.337
Hey, babe. Isn't Darrow's that
place with the killer brisket?

48:01.465 --> 48:04.345
<i>...wanted in connection not only with
that fatal house fire in Arbor Hills,</i>

48:04.473 --> 48:05.881
<i>but a hit-and-run
just a short while ago.</i>

48:06.008 --> 48:08.024
Babe, you gotta see this.

48:08.154 --> 48:09.978
<i>Neighbors
say he was badly injured</i>

48:10.105 --> 48:11.898
<i>at the auto plant where he
worked in middle management</i>

48:12.025 --> 48:14.584
- <i>and was fired just shy of his pension.</i>
- You okay?

48:14.713 --> 48:16.633
<i>He was unable to find steady
work over the last year.</i>

48:16.761 --> 48:18.810
Please tell me we own
whatever that was.

48:18.937 --> 48:21.529
<i>He was let go just yesterday
from a maintenance company</i>

48:21.657 --> 48:23.866
- <i>after being employed there less than a month.</i>
- Babe!

48:23.992 --> 48:28.537
<i>Once again, the suspect is driving
a dark-gray, late-model 4x4 pickup.</i>

48:28.666 --> 48:31.897
<i>If you have information,
please call the police tip line.</i>

48:32.024 --> 48:34.712
<i>That number is 1-800-555...</i>

48:43.096 --> 48:44.440
Deborah Haskell?

48:45.753 --> 48:47.385
Yes. Is there a problem?

48:47.514 --> 48:49.208
<i>Once again,
authorities stress</i>

48:49.338 --> 48:51.354
<i>that the suspect should be
considered dangerous.</i>

48:51.481 --> 48:53.337
<i>If you have any information
about his whereabouts...</i>

48:53.465 --> 48:56.250
<i>...please call the police tip line.</i>

49:04.216 --> 49:06.777
Baby, are you okay?

49:24.504 --> 49:26.073
You must be
Rachel's brother.

49:29.785 --> 49:31.224
Who's this?

49:33.657 --> 49:34.649
Mary.

49:35.320 --> 49:37.529
- Mary.
- Wife?

49:37.880 --> 49:40.314
Girl... Girlfriend.
Uh, fiancée, fiancée.

49:40.441 --> 49:41.688
Uh-huh.

49:41.816 --> 49:43.801
Feisty.

49:44.217 --> 49:45.752
Please don't hurt her
anymore, man.

49:45.881 --> 49:48.440
Now, that's gonna be up to you, Fred.

49:48.568 --> 49:51.577
That's gonna be
up to you and your sister.

49:52.312 --> 49:54.106
I-I-I don't understand.

49:54.232 --> 49:56.312
Rachel has dismissed me

49:56.441 --> 49:58.232
as the unworthiest fuck
to ever walk this planet.

49:58.361 --> 50:00.056
And you know what, Fred?

50:01.848 --> 50:03.928
I don't disagree.

50:05.497 --> 50:08.473
Every effort, every sacrifice I've
ever made in my invisible life

50:08.600 --> 50:11.608
has been dismissed
and judged...

50:12.057 --> 50:13.306
ignored.

50:14.009 --> 50:17.401
I've been chewed up,
used up and spat out.

50:19.865 --> 50:21.689
So I think "fuck it," Fred.

50:21.817 --> 50:25.241
I'll make my contribution this way,
through violence and retribution.

50:25.369 --> 50:27.032
'Cause that's all I got left.

50:27.161 --> 50:30.393
Look, I have some weed out
in the kitchen and ten bucks.

50:30.521 --> 50:33.049
I'm not here
for your money, Fred.

50:34.616 --> 50:36.858
I'm here to make
your sister realize

50:36.985 --> 50:39.673
that her words and actions
have consequences.

50:39.801 --> 50:42.010
- Please let my girlfriend go.
- Okay, I will.

50:42.136 --> 50:44.248
- Please.
- I will.

50:48.920 --> 50:50.361
See what she did,
that sister of yours?

50:50.489 --> 50:52.409
Look what she's done now, Fred!

50:57.752 --> 51:00.440
All right, guys.
Can you get these gates locked up?

51:04.185 --> 51:05.497
What the heck?

51:14.329 --> 51:15.417
Oh, God.

51:18.041 --> 51:20.505
It's a parent. It's all right. Ms. Flynn?

51:27.416 --> 51:29.658
This wasn't what
we talked about.

51:30.200 --> 51:31.993
Yeah, well,
fucking surprise.

51:32.409 --> 51:34.201
<i>I called the police.</i>

51:34.329 --> 51:36.088
Of course you did.

51:36.537 --> 51:38.425
Please, just...

51:39.513 --> 51:41.145
<i>Just let them go, okay?</i>

51:41.593 --> 51:43.001
Are you inside
or outside?

51:43.321 --> 51:45.241
- <i>Please, just let them go.</i>
- Rachel.

51:45.370 --> 51:47.961
Stop talking. Are you inside
or outside of that school?

51:48.889 --> 51:49.881
I'm outside.

51:50.360 --> 51:54.553
Go in, get your boy,
call me back when you get to the car.

51:54.841 --> 51:58.136
<i>And you better be driving as fast and
as far away from that school as you can.</i>

51:58.265 --> 51:59.641
Don't stop for anybody.

51:59.770 --> 52:02.425
You got three minutes,
or Fred's dead.

52:03.768 --> 52:05.145
Now, Freddy...

52:06.105 --> 52:07.704
Freddy, wake up. Come on.

52:07.833 --> 52:09.913
You gonna write your sister
a letter, okay?

52:10.041 --> 52:12.281
<i>Psychologists
and other experts say</i>

52:12.408 --> 52:15.673
<i>that incidents of road rage are
becoming increasingly more deadly.</i>

52:15.801 --> 52:17.881
<i>We must be rich,
powerful, pretty</i>

52:18.009 --> 52:19.929
<i>and celebrated
to exist in our culture.</i>

52:20.056 --> 52:23.289
<i>Those left behind are doomed
to rage like a volcano.</i>

52:23.418 --> 52:25.944
Please, just wait right here!

52:27.832 --> 52:28.953
Could you stay calm
for me, please?

52:29.081 --> 52:30.489
Get on the intercom
and call him now!

52:30.616 --> 52:33.273
- The dispatchers have already been called.
- I know.

52:33.401 --> 52:34.905
We have procedures,
all right?

52:35.033 --> 52:37.368
We're on something we call
the soft lockdown right now.

52:37.496 --> 52:39.001
I'm the reason
for that. Okay?

52:39.384 --> 52:41.049
Look. Look.

52:41.721 --> 52:43.256
That's my little brother,
okay?

52:44.345 --> 52:47.865
And this maniac's gonna hurt him
even worse if you don't go get my son

52:47.992 --> 52:50.105
in the next... two minutes.

52:50.233 --> 52:52.696
Look, that's him
texting me right now.

52:54.233 --> 52:55.608
See, look.

52:56.217 --> 52:57.945
Look. Same guy.

53:00.089 --> 53:01.625
Mrs. Ayers...

53:02.489 --> 53:03.961
I need you to go
get my son.

53:05.689 --> 53:07.737
Goddamn it, I need you
to go get my son!

53:07.865 --> 53:09.209
Dear Rachel,

53:09.337 --> 53:13.305
you are now responsible
for Mary's death.

53:13.433 --> 53:14.681
Okay?

53:14.808 --> 53:16.889
Come on.
Write the fucking letter.

53:17.017 --> 53:19.385
Careful.
Come on.

53:19.513 --> 53:21.496
Did you remember
my Butterfinger Blizzard?

53:21.624 --> 53:22.937
Get in!

53:25.529 --> 53:26.873
Seat belt.

53:35.928 --> 53:37.241
You're freaking me out.

53:37.369 --> 53:39.289
- It's gonna be okay.
- Tell me what's happening.

53:39.417 --> 53:41.913
- I'm not letting you out of my sight.
- What's going on?

53:42.648 --> 53:43.608
Mom.

53:51.481 --> 53:53.465
Mom, why aren't you
talking to me?

53:57.337 --> 53:58.968
Have you got Kyle?

53:59.577 --> 54:00.601
<i>Yes.</i>

54:02.681 --> 54:03.929
Have him say hello.

54:06.265 --> 54:08.121
Kyle, say hello.

54:08.793 --> 54:10.809
- Is it Dad?
- No.

54:11.257 --> 54:12.537
Just say hello.

54:13.849 --> 54:14.809
Hello?

54:15.641 --> 54:17.208
Now put my brother
on the phone.

54:23.801 --> 54:25.113
Talk.

54:28.921 --> 54:30.201
<i>Rachel?</i>

54:30.841 --> 54:32.185
Are you okay?

54:32.729 --> 54:34.073
<i>Fred?</i>

54:35.257 --> 54:36.729
Mary's gone.

54:37.368 --> 54:39.032
<i>Mary's dead. Mary...</i>

54:39.161 --> 54:41.561
- <i>He made me...</i>
- No, no. You didn't. You didn't.

54:41.689 --> 54:43.737
- <i>You didn't.</i>
- You're right, I didn't.

54:43.865 --> 54:45.080
You did.

54:45.209 --> 54:47.257
- What?
- Mom?

54:47.737 --> 54:49.433
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

54:54.713 --> 54:56.985
<i>Please, just...
just let him go.</i>

54:57.849 --> 54:59.480
Put me on speaker.

55:01.817 --> 55:03.001
You have kids?

55:03.929 --> 55:05.241
<i>Family?</i>

55:06.745 --> 55:09.657
Rachel, your little brother is
sitting in a puddle of lighter fluid

55:09.785 --> 55:11.193
and his own piss.

55:11.865 --> 55:13.561
Put me on fucking speaker.

55:15.768 --> 55:17.017
Okay.

55:18.744 --> 55:22.265
- <i>Kyle, can you hear me?</i>
- Yes.

55:22.393 --> 55:26.041
<i>I'm the man your mom honked her
horn at this morning. You remember?</i>

55:27.577 --> 55:28.409
Yes.

55:28.537 --> 55:30.136
Your uncle Freddy,

55:30.264 --> 55:32.473
he's written your mom a letter,
and he wants to read it out loud.

55:32.601 --> 55:35.801
It's very important that she
remains quiet and respectful

55:35.928 --> 55:38.169
and she listens
to every word, okay?

55:38.681 --> 55:40.120
Okay.

55:44.473 --> 55:46.041
Come on, Fred.

55:46.553 --> 55:47.897
Read.

55:48.313 --> 55:49.977
Come on. Read.

56:01.753 --> 56:04.824
"Dear Rachel,

56:05.401 --> 56:08.057
<i>you are now... res...</i>

56:09.465 --> 56:11.033
<i>responsible...</i>

56:11.161 --> 56:13.305
- for Mary's death."
- Responsible for Mary's death!

56:13.433 --> 56:15.417
Read the fucking letter,
Fred!

56:15.961 --> 56:18.553
"I now realize our loving...

56:19.832 --> 56:21.945
relationship has been a lie.

56:24.089 --> 56:26.425
You are the most entitled,

56:26.552 --> 56:29.913
<i>self-centered person
that I have ever known.</i>

56:31.193 --> 56:32.216
Everything has...

56:33.945 --> 56:37.081
has always been about you.

56:37.497 --> 56:39.929
I am deeply ashamed of you.

56:40.057 --> 56:42.233
You are the reason...

56:42.361 --> 56:44.761
this is happening to me

56:44.889 --> 56:48.632
and why I will never see
another sunrise in my life."

56:48.761 --> 56:49.721
Good job.

56:49.848 --> 56:51.033
Stop it! Just stop it!

56:51.160 --> 56:52.761
Are you talking to me
or to Freddy?

56:52.889 --> 56:54.617
- <i>You made your point.</i>
- Police!

56:54.744 --> 56:56.312
Show me your hands
and step back.

56:56.441 --> 56:59.609
I said put your hands in the
fucking air and step back now!

56:59.737 --> 57:02.393
- Six-Adam-Three, 10-33...
- Don't let him kill me.

57:02.521 --> 57:04.409
- ...at 1204 North Jackson.
- He has a... He has a...

57:04.537 --> 57:05.977
- Get on your knees!
- Fuck you.

57:06.106 --> 57:07.032
No!

57:11.129 --> 57:13.240
Do something! Help him!

57:14.746 --> 57:15.929
Help him!

57:54.937 --> 57:56.184
Mom?

58:01.944 --> 58:03.289
Kyle...

58:03.897 --> 58:06.296
I'm sorry.

58:11.769 --> 58:14.137
No, don't answer it.
Don't answer it.

58:14.266 --> 58:16.248
It might be the cop.

58:21.017 --> 58:22.681
Hello? Officer?

58:23.033 --> 58:24.377
It's still me.

58:25.433 --> 58:26.552
Where is my brother?

58:26.682 --> 58:28.153
<i>Sorry, Rachel.</i>

58:29.530 --> 58:30.937
<i>Freddy's gone.</i>

58:31.513 --> 58:32.728
<i>If it's any consolation,</i>

58:32.857 --> 58:35.225
a fucking cop
shot my shoulder up.

58:35.833 --> 58:37.528
I hope you bleed to death.

58:37.657 --> 58:39.001
<i>Well, that was sincere.</i>

58:39.130 --> 58:40.793
It's just not an apology.

58:40.921 --> 58:44.153
There are a lot of people in
my life who deserve apologies.

58:44.281 --> 58:45.656
You are not one of them.

58:47.897 --> 58:50.008
Let's talk about Kyle

58:50.137 --> 58:52.249
<i>and how he's gonna die.</i>

58:53.721 --> 58:55.737
You so much as breathe
in his direction,

58:55.864 --> 58:58.232
no force on this earth will
stop me from killing you.

58:58.362 --> 58:59.386
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

58:59.513 --> 59:01.273
Sounds like
you're waking up.

59:01.401 --> 59:04.537
I am wide awake.

59:04.985 --> 59:06.649
<i>Wide awake.</i>

59:06.776 --> 59:09.946
That's good,
'cause we ain't near done yet.

59:10.649 --> 59:11.833
Yes, this is over.

59:11.961 --> 59:14.552
This is so fucking over,
you sick fuck!

59:19.897 --> 59:21.433
Where should we go?

59:22.105 --> 59:24.824
Police station. We should
go to the police station.

59:35.770 --> 59:37.081
Mom?

59:37.848 --> 59:39.193
Yeah?

59:39.642 --> 59:40.953
Can I call Dad?

59:42.137 --> 59:44.568
Sweetie, I don't have
my phone, remember?

59:45.337 --> 59:46.809
That man took it.

59:47.577 --> 59:49.016
You have your tablet?

59:51.640 --> 59:53.368
I think he stole it too.

59:53.785 --> 59:55.866
Well, that's probably
a good thing.

59:56.633 --> 1:00:00.153
Well, he has your phone,
so if we had your tablet,

1:00:00.280 --> 1:00:02.008
he could know where we are.

1:00:02.617 --> 1:00:03.864
What?

1:00:04.666 --> 1:00:06.648
He did know
where we were, but...

1:00:06.777 --> 1:00:08.824
he was using
that flip phone.

1:00:09.337 --> 1:00:10.777
Don't you think?

1:00:11.353 --> 1:00:13.593
Yeah, maybe.

1:00:14.744 --> 1:00:15.865
Hey, um...

1:00:17.017 --> 1:00:20.826
I looked for my tablet before, but...
do you just wanna take another look around

1:00:20.953 --> 1:00:22.457
- just in case?
- Yeah.

1:00:24.088 --> 1:00:25.593
- Check the seat pockets.
- Okay.

1:00:26.329 --> 1:00:28.249
Have a really
good look, okay?

1:00:31.546 --> 1:00:32.889
Look under the seats.

1:00:35.129 --> 1:00:37.432
- You see it?
- I don't think it's in here.

1:00:40.600 --> 1:00:43.128
Wait, I think
I feel something.

1:00:44.953 --> 1:00:46.520
- I think I see it.
- Where?

1:00:46.649 --> 1:00:48.730
- Under your seat, it's...
- What?

1:00:48.857 --> 1:00:49.881
It's stuck. It...

1:00:50.008 --> 1:00:51.257
It's what?

1:00:51.993 --> 1:00:53.401
It was taped.

1:00:54.137 --> 1:00:55.546
Oh, my God.

1:00:55.672 --> 1:00:57.688
- Should I throw it out the window?
- Yeah.

1:00:57.977 --> 1:00:59.290
- No.
- What?

1:00:59.417 --> 1:01:00.408
Wait, wait, wait.

1:01:00.537 --> 1:01:02.488
- "Find Your Phone" app.
- Yeah?

1:01:02.617 --> 1:01:03.993
You put it
on the tablet too?

1:01:04.122 --> 1:01:05.337
Yeah.

1:01:05.464 --> 1:01:07.833
So, if he still
has my phone,

1:01:08.440 --> 1:01:10.393
we should be able
to track him, right?

1:01:10.520 --> 1:01:11.673
Right.

1:01:12.153 --> 1:01:14.456
Is it working?

1:01:15.289 --> 1:01:17.305
I see it.

1:01:17.433 --> 1:01:18.904
Where is it?

1:01:19.450 --> 1:01:20.728
Right next to us.

1:01:22.040 --> 1:01:23.448
Oh, my God.

1:01:25.146 --> 1:01:26.617
Do you see him?

1:01:34.104 --> 1:01:35.353
Oh, my God.

1:01:37.144 --> 1:01:39.064
He's in front of us.

1:01:39.577 --> 1:01:41.752
- He is?
- He has Rosie's van.

1:01:42.904 --> 1:01:45.370
Mom, look! There's a cop.

1:01:46.201 --> 1:01:48.472
- Do you see him?
- It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

1:01:48.601 --> 1:01:50.328
He can help us.

1:01:50.457 --> 1:01:52.377
Put your seat belt back on.

1:01:55.544 --> 1:01:59.001
- Do not look at him, okay?
- Okay.

1:02:21.946 --> 1:02:23.992
Mom, that... that was...

1:02:24.121 --> 1:02:25.465
The exit. I know. I know.

1:02:25.593 --> 1:02:29.080
Kyle, just trust me
and get his attention.

1:02:29.530 --> 1:02:30.872
Officer!

1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:32.441
Hey!

1:02:32.568 --> 1:02:33.944
- Officer! Help!
- Hello!

1:02:34.074 --> 1:02:36.985
- Officer! Hey!
- Hey! Help!

1:02:39.161 --> 1:02:40.697
Roll your window down!

1:02:41.017 --> 1:02:43.480
- Please help us! Hello! Hey!
- We need help!

1:02:43.609 --> 1:02:45.946
The guy you're looking for,
he's behind you!

1:02:46.072 --> 1:02:47.384
Right behind you!

1:02:49.465 --> 1:02:50.457
Please help us!

1:02:50.586 --> 1:02:51.450
Pull over!

1:02:57.241 --> 1:03:00.537
Dispatch, request assist...

1:03:08.697 --> 1:03:10.521
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1:03:16.281 --> 1:03:17.370
Can you see him?

1:03:17.497 --> 1:03:19.161
He... He's catching up.

1:03:21.306 --> 1:03:22.904
Go! Go!

1:03:23.034 --> 1:03:25.528
Kyle, call 911 on the tablet.

1:03:27.673 --> 1:03:29.304
<i>911.
What's your emergency?</i>

1:03:29.432 --> 1:03:32.344
The man on the news,
he's chasing me in a silver minivan.

1:03:32.473 --> 1:03:34.328
- <i>Your current location?</i>
- Driving on 95 south.

1:03:34.457 --> 1:03:35.833
Just after the State exit.

1:03:35.961 --> 1:03:37.626
<i>Ma'am, all units
in that vicinity</i>

1:03:37.753 --> 1:03:39.706
<i>are currently responding
to a multi-vehicle crash.</i>

1:03:39.832 --> 1:03:43.064
He caused that accident!
My son and I are in danger!

1:03:43.194 --> 1:03:44.697
<i>Ma'am, we cannot
get to you at the moment.</i>

1:03:44.824 --> 1:03:47.130
<i>Stay on the line,
get someplace safe...</i>

1:03:47.768 --> 1:03:49.050
Mom, it died!

1:03:49.177 --> 1:03:50.905
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

1:03:51.737 --> 1:03:53.689
Tell me
you have the charger.

1:03:54.681 --> 1:03:55.609
I don't.

1:03:55.737 --> 1:03:56.857
Oh, my God.

1:03:56.986 --> 1:03:58.328
We're on our own.

1:03:58.777 --> 1:03:59.961
Okay. Okay.

1:04:00.088 --> 1:04:01.848
We should just
go to the station.

1:04:01.976 --> 1:04:05.048
There's no way we can outrun him.
We have to lose him.

1:04:05.177 --> 1:04:06.968
- We need to go to Grandma's.
- Why?

1:04:07.097 --> 1:04:08.473
It's your strategy,
remember?

1:04:08.601 --> 1:04:09.817
- From the video game?
- What?

1:04:09.944 --> 1:04:11.864
It's somewhere
we're familiar with, okay?

1:04:11.994 --> 1:04:14.266
It's the safest place
to hide you.

1:04:15.001 --> 1:04:17.368
And we can call for help
with the silent alarm.

1:04:17.497 --> 1:04:20.121
And it'll confuse the heck out of
someone who's never been there before.

1:04:20.248 --> 1:04:22.489
Right, like Uncle Freddy
was saying.

1:04:22.617 --> 1:04:25.304
He still gets lost there,
like a maze of spaghetti.

1:04:25.434 --> 1:04:26.585
Yeah, exactly.

1:04:26.713 --> 1:04:27.768
So you think he'll get lost?

1:04:27.896 --> 1:04:29.337
For long enough.

1:04:43.770 --> 1:04:44.697
Drive!

1:04:44.825 --> 1:04:46.521
Go faster! Speed up!

1:05:44.377 --> 1:05:45.848
He's right behind us.

1:05:46.744 --> 1:05:48.153
He's catching up.

1:05:57.976 --> 1:05:59.288
Can you go any faster?

1:06:34.105 --> 1:06:35.353
Hold on!

1:06:43.769 --> 1:06:44.697
Fuck!

1:06:56.953 --> 1:06:59.576
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1:07:13.657 --> 1:07:15.353
- Can you see him?
- No.

1:07:15.481 --> 1:07:17.656
I think he's still back
towards the entrance.

1:08:11.898 --> 1:08:12.921
Kyle.

1:08:14.265 --> 1:08:16.089
Starting now,
we stick to our plan.

1:08:16.216 --> 1:08:17.433
Our backup plan.

1:08:17.561 --> 1:08:20.377
Yeah, if we do that,
I promise you...

1:08:21.016 --> 1:08:24.153
we're gonna get through this
together, okay, you and me.

1:08:24.441 --> 1:08:25.561
- Yeah.
- Okay?

1:08:29.465 --> 1:08:31.065
Go. Go.

1:11:23.577 --> 1:11:26.041
Look at me! Look at me!

1:11:26.169 --> 1:11:28.248
Look at me. You see me?

1:11:28.729 --> 1:11:30.329
You're always gonna see me.

1:11:30.457 --> 1:11:33.144
I'm always gonna be
inside your head.

1:11:33.433 --> 1:11:35.609
Every time you think
of your little boy...

1:11:35.737 --> 1:11:39.768
and what you could've done
to save him.

1:12:17.049 --> 1:12:18.489
Kyle?

1:12:19.736 --> 1:12:21.144
Kyle Flynn?

1:12:22.841 --> 1:12:24.601
It's the police.

1:12:25.337 --> 1:12:27.097
You're safe, son.
Come on out.

1:12:30.329 --> 1:12:31.673
Come on, son.

1:12:41.304 --> 1:12:44.569
Your mom's hurt,
but she's okay.

1:12:46.809 --> 1:12:48.569
She asked us
to come and get you.

1:13:08.313 --> 1:13:09.721
Come on, son.

1:13:10.681 --> 1:13:11.993
It's okay.

1:13:16.441 --> 1:13:17.849
Come on out, boy.

1:13:47.865 --> 1:13:50.009
- I made a lot of noise.
- It's okay.

1:13:51.288 --> 1:13:53.689
No! No! No!

1:14:10.777 --> 1:14:12.985
No! No!

1:14:13.497 --> 1:14:16.313
Get off me! Let go!

1:14:22.649 --> 1:14:24.632
Mom!

1:14:24.762 --> 1:14:26.873
No!

1:14:28.280 --> 1:14:29.305
Mom!

1:14:49.369 --> 1:14:51.289
No! No! Mom!

1:15:08.088 --> 1:15:09.400
Hey!

1:15:21.080 --> 1:15:23.737
Here's your fucking
courtesy tap!

1:15:32.184 --> 1:15:33.656
You're okay.
You're okay.

1:15:35.672 --> 1:15:36.921
Mom.

1:15:51.513 --> 1:15:55.866
We understand that it may have
started as a result of a two-car crash...

1:16:17.753 --> 1:16:18.873
Ms. Flynn?

1:16:19.736 --> 1:16:21.529
May I have a moment?

1:16:22.553 --> 1:16:24.569
It's okay.
We'll be right back.

1:16:25.209 --> 1:16:26.264
Okay?

1:16:28.120 --> 1:16:32.216
I'm so sorry...

1:16:45.337 --> 1:16:46.968
Uncle Fred's alive.

1:16:48.248 --> 1:16:49.337
He is?

1:16:49.977 --> 1:16:51.385
He's gonna be okay.

1:16:51.513 --> 1:16:52.409
Can we go see him?

1:16:52.537 --> 1:16:54.617
Yeah. Yeah.

1:16:54.744 --> 1:16:57.528
We got your statement,
so you are free to go.

1:17:41.144 --> 1:17:42.426
What's your problem?

1:17:51.897 --> 1:17:53.497
Good choice.
