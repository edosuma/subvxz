You have an instinct
for violence,

00:02.920 --> 00:04.640
I can see that in you.

00:04.720 --> 00:06.720
A Spartan does not blunder.

00:06.800 --> 00:09.960
I have a hostage,
her own daughter.

You work for me
when I tell you to.

Lord Dodds is
the Lord Chief Justice.

Miss Anne Pettifer.

00:19.440 --> 00:22.040
I prefer a riper fruit.

00:22.160 --> 00:23.840
I need your assurance
that you'll stand up

in a court of law.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.440
Do I have your word? You do.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.136
Miss Lydia Quigley,
you're under arrest for

00:29.160 --> 00:30.640
 Get out!

00:30.760 --> 00:34.280
She has the Lord Chief Justice
between her thighs.

00:34.320 --> 00:35.560
We need to fight like her.

00:35.640 --> 00:37.240
We're a fiveheaded beast now.

00:37.320 --> 00:39.400
You just tell us when to roar.

-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:11.680 --> 01:14.200
We'll stab out her eyes
with a moldy old post.

01:16.400 --> 01:19.760
Throw her in a slurry pit,
step on her head.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.456
Could always get
the King's elephant

to sit on her.

01:24.760 --> 01:26.040
Shit on her.

You're a brave slut,
Emily Lacey.

We'll look out for you.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.400
Let's hope that's enough.

Suddenly gone
very cold in here.

01:44.040 --> 01:45.240
Please keep your voices down.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.840
I'll do better than that.

01:51.920 --> 01:53.760
I'll go home.

01:53.840 --> 01:55.560
To my Will.

02:06.120 --> 02:09.160
Ride hard, my stallion!

02:09.280 --> 02:11.840
Faster, boy, faster!

02:27.080 --> 02:30.680
The race is won!

02:30.720 --> 02:33.560
You are exquisite.

02:33.680 --> 02:40.240
And you, my good sir,
are a powerful steed.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.520
I hope we may ride together
often.

Morning.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.520
Girls.

03:01.560 --> 03:03.400
I need you to go
on a molly hunt for me.

03:04.560 --> 03:05.800
Prince Rasselas.

03:05.840 --> 03:07.000
Do you know him?

03:07.080 --> 03:09.360
That pretty boy
with a look of the East?

03:09.400 --> 03:11.000
That's him.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.360
I need you to find him.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.560
Look everywhere.

03:13.680 --> 03:15.800
Covent Garden, Sodomite's Walk,

03:15.840 --> 03:17.400
all the molly houses.

03:17.440 --> 03:19.120
Tell him I want to see him.

03:19.160 --> 03:20.840
We'll pay if we have to.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.800
Go on. You should not admit

03:23.840 --> 03:26.360
such an unnatural creature
into this house.

03:26.400 --> 03:29.400
We admit much worse.

03:29.520 --> 03:31.600
Tell Mr. Hunt
you made it yourself.

03:31.680 --> 03:34.400
That's a lie, Mother.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.720
You need not wear your cap.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.400
Sounds like you're trying
to marry her off,

03:40.520 --> 03:41.840
Mrs. Scanwell.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.800
He is a man
of sound convictions,

03:44.840 --> 03:46.680
with a good salary
from the crown.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.440
I like your thinking.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.560
You should come and work
as a pimp for us.

03:50.680 --> 03:52.400
Fanny?

03:52.520 --> 03:55.720
She's just trying to do
what's best for her daughter.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.280
Like all of us.

04:02.880 --> 04:04.240
Fanny.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.720
Don't do that again.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.800
Don't insult me
in front of Mrs. Scanwell.

04:10.840 --> 04:14.560
What about my baby, then?

04:14.680 --> 04:16.480
You've said she has to go
when she's weaned.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.040
And if she goes, I go.

04:19.160 --> 04:22.120
Who'll be your best girl then?

04:22.160 --> 04:26.480
What's in your tea
this morning?

04:26.600 --> 04:30.720
I wouldn't dream of
parting you from each other.

04:30.800 --> 04:33.040
No more stomach for it.

04:33.160 --> 04:35.480
Thank you.

04:35.560 --> 04:39.120
Think the justice
will act, Mrs. Wells?

04:39.160 --> 04:42.360
On the button that we found
in Kitty's hair?

05:35.480 --> 05:38.040
I'll not sleep on the chaise.

05:44.920 --> 05:48.840
Can you forgive
my cockeyed notions?

06:06.360 --> 06:09.360
We must show...

06:09.480 --> 06:13.480
that Golden Square
thrives once more.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.720
I think it's time
for our annual audience

06:17.800 --> 06:19.360
with the goddess Vesta.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.800
Can I play Vesta again?

06:20.920 --> 06:22.040
Don't be silly, Ann.

06:22.160 --> 06:24.720
Charlotte is our goddess.

06:24.800 --> 06:29.720
You may organize
the rituals of the virgins,

06:29.800 --> 06:33.680
while I find us a real one
to sacrifice.

06:46.360 --> 06:48.680
I'll come with you.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.256
I want to know
how the best bawd in London

06:50.280 --> 06:52.800
snags a virgin.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.120
To what purpose?

06:55.160 --> 06:56.360
To learn.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.800
To be like her.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.600
I wonder if you have
the stomach for it.

07:09.360 --> 07:10.720
Try me.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.280
Hmph.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.920
Go away, Emily Pig.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.240
But I love Emily Pig.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.600
You should love
a little piglet like me.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.680
No.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.480
Why not sail
on Nell's fulsome tides?

07:30.560 --> 07:33.600
Or we could just have a poke.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.360
You have her.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.720
I'll take the little one.

07:38.800 --> 07:42.240
Cherry, would you like
to entertain this gentleman?

07:42.280 --> 07:45.400
I'm entertaining Charles.
He can spare you.

07:52.600 --> 07:53.800
Get up, Emily!

07:53.920 --> 07:56.040
Your house is busy.

08:02.040 --> 08:04.840
Help! Someone,
my cull's gone mad!

08:04.920 --> 08:06.920
Get away, maggot!

08:07.040 --> 08:08.480
I'll mash your face in!

08:08.560 --> 08:09.920
Nell!

08:10.040 --> 08:11.800
Help! Nell!

08:14.360 --> 08:15.480
Charlie!

08:15.600 --> 08:17.400
What?

08:22.800 --> 08:24.160
Tie him up!

08:24.240 --> 08:28.720
Charles, go to the tavern,
fetch William North.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.000
Go, go!

08:30.040 --> 08:31.680
My children!

08:35.120 --> 08:37.240
You're lucky this knife's
not for you.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.320
Get out! Move!

08:54.880 --> 08:58.640
This is it, Nance,
it's started.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.440
Where's North, where's North?

09:04.480 --> 09:06.880
North!

09:07.000 --> 09:08.520
Harriet.

09:08.600 --> 09:09.600
Bad men.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.000
Wait!

09:17.000 --> 09:19.200
lt's plain as day
what your ma's up to.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.360
Don't. Why?

09:21.480 --> 09:23.000
Make a good match.

09:23.120 --> 09:23.960
You can sing hymns together

09:24.000 --> 09:27.440
before humping. Stop it.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.320
Miss Scanwell.

09:29.360 --> 09:33.000
I expect you've heard by now
about Mrs. Quigley.

09:33.080 --> 09:37.640
It seems I have met with
the limits of the law.

09:37.720 --> 09:40.480
lf you concede that,

09:40.520 --> 09:45.360
what is your purpose?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.080
Think she likes you.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.640
Twittering turd!

10:07.320 --> 10:08.520
Who sent you?

10:10.600 --> 10:13.120
The Duke of York.

10:15.600 --> 10:20.200
You insolent bollock bag!

10:20.240 --> 10:22.360
Who hired you?

10:28.480 --> 10:30.960
The bawd! Quigley!

10:32.760 --> 10:34.720
Quigley sent us.

11:01.200 --> 11:04.320
These people want honest jobs.

11:04.360 --> 11:06.120
They think they do.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.720
But who really
wants to be a drudge

11:07.760 --> 11:10.000
for six pounds a year
when they can live in splendor

11:10.120 --> 11:12.760
at Golden Square?

11:12.840 --> 11:16.520
The virgin will come willingly
if you pay her enough.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.840
But she'd lack the reticence

11:18.960 --> 11:23.000
so prized amongst our gentlemen.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.240
You know my standards.

11:25.320 --> 11:28.120
Secure me a pretty maid
and be sure to test her

11:28.240 --> 11:31.120
about her virtue.

11:31.240 --> 11:33.120
You show me.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.520
lf you really want
to be my apprentice,

11:35.600 --> 11:38.080
I insist you try.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.760
Who was your first?

11:49.080 --> 11:52.720
A stable boy, chosen by me.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.880
How many men
have you had since?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.600
I'm a harlot.

11:59.120 --> 12:01.120
I don't keep count.

12:03.360 --> 12:07.120
How many have
given you pleasure?

12:07.200 --> 12:09.320
Only you.

12:09.360 --> 12:12.320
Well, that makes me
your true first.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.360
Do you seek work?

12:50.480 --> 12:52.600
Yes, ma'am.

12:52.640 --> 12:54.200
What's your experience?

12:54.240 --> 12:57.880
Keeping house
with my ma, mostly.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.080
Will I be free to go
to church on Sundays?

13:02.120 --> 13:04.000
No.

13:04.120 --> 13:05.160
We're a godless household,

13:05.240 --> 13:08.520
you should seek somewhere else.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.720
Why have you let her go?

13:14.760 --> 13:16.640
She could be positively regal.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.840
She wanted to go to church.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.720


13:20.840 --> 13:22.960
Tell them what
they want to hear,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.600
just get them through the door.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.120
You are more artful with words.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.320
We'll do it together.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.960
Where have you gone to?

13:56.520 --> 14:00.000
I was thinking about Kitty.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.600
Who killed her.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.760
These things befall the weak.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.080
You think it was her fault?

14:16.360 --> 14:18.480
There are hunters,

14:18.520 --> 14:22.000
and there are prey.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.840
Killing is an art.

14:24.880 --> 14:28.880
A killer has a certain nobility.

14:30.240 --> 14:32.880
A superiority of character.

14:37.080 --> 14:40.520
I thought killing
was a desperate act.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.360
Quite the contrary.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.240
It is the preserve
of a select few.

15:00.520 --> 15:04.000
I had a friend who liked faro.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.200
You are a tasty piece,

15:06.240 --> 15:08.320
but we do not wish to hear.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.120
She's dead now.

15:12.120 --> 15:16.480
Were her brains in her udders,
like yours?

15:25.840 --> 15:27.720
That's the man.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.840
Could I have a word, sir?

15:35.880 --> 15:38.480
Can a gentleman
not play cards in peace?

15:38.520 --> 15:40.840
lf you would
step over here with me,

15:40.880 --> 15:44.320
we can... tttalk in private.

15:44.360 --> 15:48.200
I don't want
to tttalk at all.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.880
Then I will apply for a warrant

15:50.000 --> 15:52.360
and come to your house.

15:52.480 --> 15:53.720
Outrageous!

15:53.840 --> 15:56.720
This is meant to be a refuge.

15:56.840 --> 15:59.240
Who let this dismal man in?

16:06.080 --> 16:09.240
I will not tolerate
the consumption of alcohol,

16:09.360 --> 16:13.360
nor any liaison with young men.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.240
The smell of drink
makes me sick, ma'am,

16:15.320 --> 16:20.200
and I've never
so much as kissed a boy.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.200


16:22.240 --> 16:26.440
Well, I'm sure you'll fit
right in.

16:35.360 --> 16:38.760
The truth is always best.

16:38.840 --> 16:40.880
Do excuse me one moment.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.760
I wish to give alms to the poor.

16:43.840 --> 16:47.600
...and the truth, and the life.

16:47.640 --> 16:51.320
We must not lie to each other.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.640
I smell ratsbane.

16:55.720 --> 16:58.360
You will taste it
if you fail to do as I ask.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.960
I have no fears for my life.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.840
What of Amelia's?

17:03.960 --> 17:06.200
What life could she expect,
I wonder,

17:06.240 --> 17:08.160
if it were known
she spends her days

17:08.240 --> 17:10.760
tuft hunting
with her black whore?

17:13.319 --> 17:15.480
What hell broth do you spew?

17:15.520 --> 17:19.000
One of your daughter's making.

17:19.040 --> 17:21.079
I want you to go to Justice Hunt

17:21.200 --> 17:22.760
and to tell him
that Margaret Wells

17:22.880 --> 17:25.200
is forcing girls
to work in her house

17:25.240 --> 17:27.000
against their will.

17:27.040 --> 17:28.680
Tell him how it sickens you,

17:28.720 --> 17:30.800
how you cannot bear such cruelty

17:30.920 --> 17:34.280
even for one day more.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.880
She's a good woman.

17:36.960 --> 17:40.640
Your mother.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.280
She's not my mother.

17:48.680 --> 17:49.960
There.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.960
Such deeds are so bracing
for the soul.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.000
ls that him?

18:05.880 --> 18:07.480
Rasselas?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.240
Who in Lucifer's name are you?

18:22.920 --> 18:24.520
Mr. Hunt.

18:24.640 --> 18:26.000


18:26.040 --> 18:28.080
Um, for you,

18:28.200 --> 18:30.680
in return for
the delicious gift you left,

18:30.720 --> 18:33.040
with an apology,
I fear I upset you earlier.

18:33.160 --> 18:35.720
I apologize.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.760
I wasI was harsh.

18:37.880 --> 18:43.200
Then we make
an apologetic... pppair.

18:48.520 --> 18:49.960
Would you take a walk with me?

18:52.680 --> 18:53.880
Um...

19:05.640 --> 19:06.720
Come on, Charlie!

19:06.760 --> 19:08.160
Put some chops into it!

19:08.240 --> 19:11.560
She broke her word!

19:11.680 --> 19:14.760
I will not let her scare us.

19:14.880 --> 19:18.240
She will feel
the sting of my tongue.

19:18.280 --> 19:21.480
You stay away from her.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.920
Keep your fists up, big man.

19:30.760 --> 19:32.240
Come to crow?

19:32.280 --> 19:33.280
I've come to help.

19:33.400 --> 19:36.040
You helped me once before.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.240
Deserve that.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.240
What kind of mother
attacks her own son?

19:44.760 --> 19:47.480
Concentrate.
You leave him alone.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.720
You promised me protection.

19:57.760 --> 19:58.920
You're not helping,

19:59.000 --> 20:01.520
keeping the son in the house.

20:01.640 --> 20:03.240
How did she find out so soon?

20:03.280 --> 20:04.520
Not from him.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.240
He's my only shield against her.

20:06.320 --> 20:08.280
Shame he's a useless prick.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.000
You need a bully.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.720
Get soldier boy in there.
I can't pay him.

20:12.760 --> 20:14.480
I've got repairs to make.

20:14.560 --> 20:16.320
I'll pay.

20:16.440 --> 20:19.880
Till you're sorted.

20:19.960 --> 20:21.720
Guilt money.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.040
I'll take it.

20:28.320 --> 20:31.760
And stick a musket
up Charlotte's ass.

20:31.880 --> 20:33.680
What is she doing in that house?

20:33.720 --> 20:36.200
She stands to lose
more than any of us.

20:38.520 --> 20:41.160
Not from where I'm standing.

20:43.480 --> 20:44.720
I'm the eldest of five.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.200
My mother cried when I left.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.880
But she'll be pleased
when I send money home.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.240
And where is home?

20:50.280 --> 20:52.960
Langley 

20:53.000 --> 20:54.640
London must be overwhelming.

20:54.720 --> 20:55.960
Well, it would be,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.480
had I not met such kind people
so soon.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.280
I look forward
to repaying your faith

21:00.400 --> 21:02.280
with hard work.

21:02.400 --> 21:06.200
Well, we're very lucky
to have found you.

21:28.040 --> 21:30.400
I have dedicated myself
to the law,

21:30.480 --> 21:34.080
but discovering
its imperfections

21:34.200 --> 21:35.440
leads me to question

21:35.480 --> 21:37.920
my whole life. Please don't.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.240
You do your best.
But I... I can do better.

21:42.320 --> 21:43.880
Your goodness is a standard

21:43.960 --> 21:45.520
by which I wish to be measured.

21:45.640 --> 21:47.240
I am not good.

21:47.320 --> 21:51.080
But you have
transformed Violet.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.880
Given the right position
in society,

21:52.960 --> 21:56.040
you could guide so many others.

22:01.800 --> 22:04.400
Would you be my wife?

22:06.240 --> 22:09.000
You could keep me steadfast.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.000
I could keep you safe.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.520
This is, um, too sudden, I see.

22:22.680 --> 22:25.040
Please.

22:25.160 --> 22:29.160
I ask... only
that you think about it.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.176
You'll answer the door
and gauge the culls.

22:36.200 --> 22:39.040
And come running
if we start screaming.

22:39.160 --> 22:41.520
Does this mean
I get favorable terms?

22:41.640 --> 22:44.240
No terms, no touching.

22:44.320 --> 22:47.280
You're one of us now.
Like a big brother.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.040
You can teach me to fight.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.200
That's not fun.

22:51.240 --> 22:52.720
I'd rather teach you some things

22:52.760 --> 22:55.040
I learned in France.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.720
We know it all.

23:04.080 --> 23:07.240
Was it worth running?

23:07.280 --> 23:11.160
I feared the same fate
as your girl.

23:11.240 --> 23:15.440
A life lived in fear
is not life worth living.

23:18.680 --> 23:20.480
What do you want of me?

23:28.000 --> 23:31.320
I want you to be my eyes
in Golden Square.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.480
Rasselas!

23:36.560 --> 23:38.520
Amelia!

23:41.800 --> 23:45.680
Where have you been?

23:45.720 --> 23:48.000
There must be some good in you

23:48.080 --> 23:50.240
to be missed so.

23:53.480 --> 23:56.480
She will fit in well.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.880
What if she doesn't want to?

23:58.960 --> 24:01.000
Why wouldn't she?

24:01.040 --> 24:04.040
Virtue is a hindrance
to a woman.

24:04.160 --> 24:07.200
After tonight, she can climb.

24:23.320 --> 24:26.200
I'm proud of you.

24:26.240 --> 24:27.536
Your mother was never
strong enough

24:27.560 --> 24:29.800
to help with new girls.

24:29.920 --> 24:32.280
You surpass her in every way.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.880
What do you want, Charles?

25:07.720 --> 25:11.080
No true mother would
attack her son's home.

25:11.200 --> 25:14.960
And no son of mine would be
such a dullheaded dupe.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.696
We had an agreement.
Which your treacherous

25:16.720 --> 25:19.480
trollop broke,
she tried to have me hanged.

25:19.520 --> 25:21.720
You're lying. Am I?

25:21.760 --> 25:24.280
Go to the justice,
ask him yourself,

25:24.400 --> 25:27.560
and get out of my house!

25:32.320 --> 25:36.000
How can I stand at an altar
and vow before God

25:36.040 --> 25:39.560
to worship his body?

25:42.040 --> 25:44.720
I always follow my heart

25:44.760 --> 25:46.320
and live in penury for it.

25:48.480 --> 25:49.800
Amelia.

25:49.920 --> 25:51.920
A word?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.480
Alone.

26:11.640 --> 26:14.920
I do not like
the company you keep.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.640
He's my friend. He's a sinner.

26:17.720 --> 26:20.480
Jesus taught us
to go among them.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.560
But not to become one.

26:25.400 --> 26:26.720
I know.

26:28.480 --> 26:30.480
I know the grubby little
secret you have

26:30.520 --> 26:33.480
with Violet Cross.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.480
I met Mr. Hunt.

26:41.560 --> 26:44.480
God has put him in your way.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.240
He asked me for your hand.

26:46.320 --> 26:48.720
I can't marry him.
You will marry him!

26:51.000 --> 26:53.040
I have given my life
to you, Amelia.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.800
I ask that you do this
in return.

26:54.920 --> 26:57.240
But I don't love him.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.000
Love.

27:03.760 --> 27:05.000
Mr. Hunt will save us.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.640
Your black whore
will drag you down.

27:12.720 --> 27:13.960
For God's sake, man,

27:14.000 --> 27:15.640
first you interrupt my whoring

27:15.720 --> 27:17.680
and then this warrant arrives.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.000
Lord Liddington has been
implicated in a murder.

27:20.040 --> 27:22.760
I'm sure you'll agree
there is a distinction.

27:22.880 --> 27:25.640
He is the son of
the Earl of Hovingham.

27:25.720 --> 27:26.920
There is evidence.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.040
This was found
on the murdered woman.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.920
It matches a jacket worn by...

27:34.000 --> 27:36.200
Lord Liddington.
Did you find it?

27:36.240 --> 27:37.456
No, one of
the victim's friends.

27:37.480 --> 27:38.736
Have you seen
the matching jacket?

27:38.760 --> 27:40.400
No. So...

27:40.480 --> 27:42.160
you want to raise a warrant

27:42.240 --> 27:44.240
on the strength of a button

27:44.320 --> 27:46.240
and the word of a whore?

27:47.680 --> 27:49.240
If there is anything in this,

27:49.320 --> 27:53.080
you must find
plausible evidence.

27:53.200 --> 27:56.000
And stop harassing the nobility.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.280
I feel sick.

28:08.400 --> 28:09.680
lt's not your crime.

28:09.720 --> 28:12.480
lt will be if I don't save her.

28:12.560 --> 28:15.160
Entrapment, rape, ruin.

28:15.240 --> 28:18.520
Then let's go
to the Justice now.

28:18.640 --> 28:20.960
I'm implicated in all of it.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.440
And he won't want
a repeat of last night.

28:24.480 --> 28:26.400
We have to get the girl to him.

28:26.480 --> 28:27.560
How?

28:33.520 --> 28:35.640
We need someone trustworthy

28:35.720 --> 28:37.720
to bid for her

28:37.760 --> 28:39.760
and take her from the house.

28:39.880 --> 28:42.040
Do you know of anyone?

28:45.000 --> 28:48.400
I don't trust a single soul
in my circle.

28:50.640 --> 28:53.880
Then I must go to my ma
on Greek Street.

28:53.960 --> 28:56.040
She'll find someone.

28:56.160 --> 28:58.480
Here. It's over 100 pounds.

28:58.520 --> 29:02.000
I've known men
bid 200 for a virgin.

29:02.080 --> 29:04.240
Add to it if you can.

29:04.280 --> 29:05.640
Ma will too.

29:08.040 --> 29:09.720
You trust me to do this?

29:13.520 --> 29:14.520
Abigail.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.680
That's the girl's name.

29:19.720 --> 29:22.080
A sweet thing,

29:22.200 --> 29:24.280
untarnished by our world.

29:28.680 --> 29:31.000
Help her stay that way.

30:10.080 --> 30:11.880
Miss Scanwell.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.000
Come in, come in.

30:16.800 --> 30:19.080
Please.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.640
Dare I hope you...

30:24.200 --> 30:26.560
have an answer for me?

30:30.000 --> 30:32.400
Yes.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.240
My answer is yes.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.920
My mother's keen
for it to happen soon.

30:43.560 --> 30:45.200
My dear.

30:50.720 --> 30:55.400
This is my most
prized possession,

30:55.480 --> 30:59.000
acquired from
the furthest reaches of Greece.

30:59.080 --> 31:04.800
The dagger of a Spartan warrior.

31:04.920 --> 31:08.400
The Spartans were
a superior race.

31:08.480 --> 31:11.040
They killed their lessers,
the Helots,

31:11.160 --> 31:12.720
as a rite of passage.

31:12.800 --> 31:15.000
What made them lesser?

31:15.080 --> 31:17.480
Their blood.

31:17.520 --> 31:19.440
Have you ever used it?

31:21.280 --> 31:23.320
I consider myself a Spartan.

31:25.320 --> 31:27.760
Does that scare you?

31:38.960 --> 31:41.000
I'm a Spartan too.

31:43.560 --> 31:45.000
You want money.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.400
I always want money.

31:47.480 --> 31:51.240
ls Charlotte Wells
blackmailing you?

31:51.320 --> 31:52.960
She saw me out riding naked

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
and threatens to ruin
my reputation.

31:55.040 --> 31:57.520
What's left of it.
I'm a grown woman.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.040
I should have free access

31:59.160 --> 32:00.040
to the money Father left me.

32:00.160 --> 32:01.720
You are ludicrous.

32:01.760 --> 32:05.240
Cavorting with a harlot,
letting her fleece you.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.640
It would be reckless of me
to give an imbecile like you

32:07.720 --> 32:09.680
your own funds.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.480
You need me to take care of you.

32:11.520 --> 32:13.440
You're not fit
to take care of anyone.

32:13.480 --> 32:14.720
You see? You're disturbed.

32:14.760 --> 32:18.400
Attacking your devoted guardian.

32:18.480 --> 32:19.760
Just give me a hundred pounds

32:19.880 --> 32:21.960
and I will leave you in peace.

32:23.520 --> 32:25.160
ls it the bawd
who blackmails you,

32:25.240 --> 32:28.280
is Charlotte...
Give me my money!

32:28.400 --> 32:30.240
I'm getting warmer.

32:42.480 --> 32:44.016
That's all you get
till you start telling me

32:44.040 --> 32:46.000
some truths.

33:11.760 --> 33:15.560
You have been elusive.

33:15.680 --> 33:17.720
The new justice
is hanging my kind.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.640
And persecuting mine.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.760
Your cheek looks hollow.

33:26.720 --> 33:29.000
I lost my dear boy.

33:30.880 --> 33:32.760
So did I.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.320
Hmph.

33:40.520 --> 33:41.920
We're hosting a communion

33:42.000 --> 33:44.080
of Vestal Virgins this evening.

33:46.960 --> 33:49.640
Stay.

33:49.720 --> 33:52.880
Be our honorary eunuch.

34:15.440 --> 34:16.480
Come again.

34:16.520 --> 34:19.880
You're welcome anytime.

34:19.960 --> 34:22.000
Fanny, how you getting on
up there?

34:24.920 --> 34:28.560
He only paid for half an hour!

34:44.679 --> 34:49.400
"The prince hacked his way
through the forest

34:49.480 --> 34:51.639
and climbed to the tower

34:51.760 --> 34:55.920
"where the beauty lay sleeping."

34:56.000 --> 34:58.280
Much like your todger.

35:16.480 --> 35:18.120
You lost?

35:18.200 --> 35:19.880
He had a good old sniff
of my fundament,

35:19.960 --> 35:22.000
but he didn't want to touch it.

35:25.360 --> 35:27.640
Margaret.

35:31.360 --> 35:32.680
Girls.

35:40.480 --> 35:43.040
I'm Lady Isabella Fitzwilliam.

35:43.120 --> 35:46.200
Charlotte sent me.

35:46.320 --> 35:50.800
She's contrived the means
to trap the viper Quigley.

35:50.880 --> 35:52.320
And what's Quigley to you?

35:52.400 --> 35:54.640
A perpetual menace.

35:59.120 --> 36:02.400
And what does Charlotte
want us to do?

36:02.480 --> 36:05.000
We need to buy a virgin.

36:18.200 --> 36:20.840
Webster's needed
in Greek Street.

36:20.920 --> 36:22.480
He's only been here a minute.

36:22.520 --> 36:24.120
Well...

36:24.200 --> 36:26.440
I'll be your bully tonight.

36:26.480 --> 36:29.600
Mags has other plans for him.

36:45.800 --> 36:49.480
What are you doing
skulking in here?

36:49.520 --> 36:52.760
You scared of Nancy?
Scared of you.

36:54.600 --> 36:57.920
Why did you give evidence
against my mother?

36:58.000 --> 37:01.480
Not sure that I did.
Don't lie!

37:01.520 --> 37:02.920
She threatened to kill me.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.320
Then you should have
come to me,

37:05.400 --> 37:07.320
instead of plotting
with the Wells woman

37:07.400 --> 37:09.560
and that virago out there.

37:09.640 --> 37:12.680
I know. I know.

37:12.800 --> 37:13.840
I'm sorry.

37:15.920 --> 37:17.480
You're my shield.

37:17.560 --> 37:19.800
You'll protect me
against her, won't you?

37:24.080 --> 37:26.840
You have to.

37:26.920 --> 37:29.520
I need you.

37:29.600 --> 37:31.480
I can't trust you.

37:41.040 --> 37:42.880
Then trust this.

37:42.960 --> 37:45.560
There's a little Quigley
growing inside me.

38:11.320 --> 38:13.760
Welcome, gentlemen,

38:13.840 --> 38:17.560
to the sacred Temple of Vesta.

38:17.640 --> 38:22.200
Behold her chaste priestesses,
the Vestal Virgins,

38:22.320 --> 38:26.120
as they prepare the way
for the goddess herself.

38:26.200 --> 38:29.000
Praise Vesta!

38:29.080 --> 38:30.120
Goddess of the hearth

38:30.200 --> 38:31.960
and bringer of good fortune.

38:34.160 --> 38:35.960
Make your sacrifices, gentlemen,

38:36.000 --> 38:37.360
that you may approach her.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.440
EnchantĂŠ.

38:46.280 --> 38:50.040
Sent especially for you
from Greek Street.

38:55.320 --> 38:57.200
Got your story straight?

38:57.320 --> 38:58.960
I think so.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.480
The lads'll be outside

39:00.560 --> 39:04.360
when you bring the girl out.

39:16.680 --> 39:19.320
You sure he's up to it?

39:19.400 --> 39:21.520
Chance to play the hero.

39:21.600 --> 39:25.040
He'll love every minute of it.

39:50.200 --> 39:54.000
You seem agitated,
for a goddess.

39:54.080 --> 39:56.160
I'm waiting for the moment
that girl awakes

39:56.280 --> 39:58.120
and screams the house down.

39:58.200 --> 39:59.640
Have confidence.

39:59.760 --> 40:02.480
She will remain in a stupor
all evening.

40:04.960 --> 40:07.320
What swarthy stranger is this?

40:07.400 --> 40:10.080
Welcome, sir, you're new
to Golden Square.

40:10.160 --> 40:13.200
I'm long overdue.

40:13.320 --> 40:15.120
Why, Mr. Webster.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.520
So glad you could come.

40:16.600 --> 40:19.840
You know this gentleman.
ln every sense.

40:19.920 --> 40:22.960
He's obscenely rich. 

40:23.000 --> 40:25.920
What is your business?
Coffee beans, madam.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.800
Only the finest.

40:27.880 --> 40:31.280
Miss Wells knows
of my rarefied tastes.

40:32.880 --> 40:34.600
I can see why she invited me.

40:34.680 --> 40:38.760
Then, please,
enter the Temple of Vesta.

40:53.760 --> 40:55.680
Will you frolic with me?

40:55.800 --> 40:58.280
lt smells funny.

40:58.360 --> 41:00.440
lt relaxes the mind.

41:00.480 --> 41:03.200
Like laudanum.

41:03.320 --> 41:06.120
My ma's against all that.

41:06.200 --> 41:09.680
She won't take on girls that
have anything to do with it.

41:09.800 --> 41:14.480
And you always do
what your mother tells you.

41:14.520 --> 41:16.800
Even if she'll never know.

41:47.440 --> 41:49.360
Excuse me, sir.

41:49.440 --> 41:51.120
Have I wandered into heaven?

41:51.200 --> 41:54.880
Very close, we hope.
What a delightful surprise.

41:54.960 --> 41:58.680
Please enter our temple
of sacred virgins.

41:58.800 --> 42:00.640
I wished only a word.

42:00.760 --> 42:04.400
I'm at your service,
Your Lordship.

42:04.480 --> 42:08.080
Are you blackmailing my sister?

42:08.160 --> 42:11.400
 "Blackmail" is such
a vulgar word.

42:11.480 --> 42:14.280
I am a keeper of secrets.

42:14.360 --> 42:16.560
And you keep hers?

42:16.640 --> 42:20.200
Who would ever trust me
if I gave anything away?

42:24.440 --> 42:27.480
Can you not keep away from me?

42:27.560 --> 42:29.760
I am relentless.

42:34.440 --> 42:37.800
My demons are all put to bed.

42:37.880 --> 42:40.840
Surely you are too young
to have demons.

42:43.080 --> 42:45.480
Perhaps I am a demon.

42:49.920 --> 42:52.000
What did you mean earlier

42:52.080 --> 42:54.120
when you said
you were a Spartan?

42:57.440 --> 43:00.640
The same as you.

43:00.760 --> 43:02.520
You've killed?

43:04.520 --> 43:06.560
With one stab.

43:09.800 --> 43:11.040
Who?

43:15.440 --> 43:17.280
I can't say.

43:17.360 --> 43:20.360
Your sort stick together.

43:20.440 --> 43:23.880
And I know really, I'm a Helot.

43:26.360 --> 43:28.480
You killed a superior in class?

43:30.560 --> 43:33.000
Superior in stupidity.

43:37.800 --> 43:39.960
Sir George Howard, perchance?

43:42.320 --> 43:43.320
Shh.

43:48.280 --> 43:51.000
Audacious.

43:51.080 --> 43:53.680
You are indeed a Spartan.

43:53.800 --> 43:57.040
A worthy consort.

44:07.800 --> 44:09.080
Gentlemen!

44:09.160 --> 44:12.080
What you see before you
is artifice.

44:12.160 --> 44:13.800
The real virgin lies upstairs,

44:13.880 --> 44:16.480
as chaste as the day
she was born.

44:18.200 --> 44:20.480
She offers herself
as a sacrifice

44:20.560 --> 44:23.680
to the highest bidder.
May we see her?

44:23.800 --> 44:26.920
She is a timid creature.

44:27.000 --> 44:31.280
Shy, quivering, expectant.

44:31.360 --> 44:34.280
In beauty, she more than matches
Vesta's retinue.

44:34.360 --> 44:37.080
The rites of Vesta take place
but once a year.

44:37.160 --> 44:40.920
I will never understand
men's desire for a virgin.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.760
lt is like
taking the first bite

44:43.840 --> 44:46.280
of a pristine piece of fruit,

44:46.360 --> 44:48.840
and the pleasure lies
in feeling the flesh give way

44:48.920 --> 44:50.840
and the juices stir.

44:53.480 --> 44:56.880
Who will open the bidding
at 50 pounds?

44:59.000 --> 45:01.800
Surely a man like you
would prefer a real woman

45:01.880 --> 45:03.280
like me.

45:03.360 --> 45:06.560
Fresh fruit cleanses
the palate.

45:06.640 --> 45:08.080
Do I hear 60, gentlemen,

45:08.160 --> 45:10.600
or is the field clear
for the marquess?

45:14.960 --> 45:17.560
Do I hear 70?

45:17.640 --> 45:20.280
Eighty?

45:20.360 --> 45:23.000
Ninety?

45:23.080 --> 45:25.040
One hundred?

45:25.120 --> 45:26.880
They'll have no money
left for me.

45:26.960 --> 45:28.800
100 from the marquess.

45:28.880 --> 45:31.960
110 for our untouched pearl.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.200
120.

45:34.320 --> 45:36.360
130.

45:36.440 --> 45:37.920
140.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.040
150.

45:39.120 --> 45:40.480
160.

45:40.520 --> 45:42.480
170.

45:42.520 --> 45:43.880
180.

45:43.960 --> 45:46.680
Two hundred pounds.

45:46.800 --> 45:49.160
A most generous bid
from the dark gentleman.

45:52.200 --> 45:54.840
What are you doing?

45:54.920 --> 45:56.480
You can't have her.

45:58.040 --> 46:02.560
Do I have any advance on 200?

46:02.640 --> 46:04.760
I want you

46:04.840 --> 46:06.480
more than ever.

46:16.080 --> 46:19.520
200 pounds, gentlemen,
our final offer.

46:19.600 --> 46:21.880
Sold!

46:21.960 --> 46:23.376
Well done, good sire.
Congratulations.

46:23.400 --> 46:25.640
They'll be here soon.

46:25.760 --> 46:28.000
We'll have to go to Hunt's.

46:28.080 --> 46:31.800
And then Charlotte can
get out of that hellhole.

46:31.880 --> 46:34.000
That bitch Quigley
will be buried forever.

46:36.520 --> 46:38.000
What?

46:42.280 --> 46:44.160
I'm home.

46:56.200 --> 46:58.360
I will pay more
to dally with her

46:58.440 --> 47:00.320
in my own lodgings.

47:00.400 --> 47:03.960
She's like a newborn lamb.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.120
She needs the security
of the familiar.

47:07.200 --> 47:10.360
He's paid enough
to take her to China and back.

47:10.440 --> 47:13.480
This should make up
the difference.

47:13.560 --> 47:15.120


47:19.760 --> 47:22.440
Where did you get
that necklace?

47:22.480 --> 47:23.960
I won it.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.480
At cards. .

47:26.520 --> 47:28.480
It belonged to my grandmother.

47:28.520 --> 47:31.600
He won it from your sister.

47:31.680 --> 47:33.160
I was with her.

47:36.480 --> 47:39.360
The woman you won this from,

47:39.440 --> 47:41.360
what did she look like?

47:41.440 --> 47:44.480
I was with her.

47:44.560 --> 47:45.800
I saw her take the necklace off

47:45.840 --> 47:47.200
and throw it in as a stake.

47:47.320 --> 47:48.640
Why such protest?

47:48.760 --> 47:51.120
It's a simple question
for Mr. Webster.

47:55.160 --> 47:57.520
I drunk a lot of wine
that night.

47:57.600 --> 47:58.920


47:59.000 --> 48:01.320
I don't remember.

48:01.400 --> 48:04.080
You don't doubt me,
do you, Mrs. Quigley?

48:06.760 --> 48:10.560
This man is a liar and a thief,
put him out.

48:10.640 --> 48:12.880
I won that girl.

48:12.960 --> 48:14.680
Get off me!

48:19.360 --> 48:21.480
Why won't you listen to me?

48:21.520 --> 48:24.040
Your Lordship,

48:24.120 --> 48:26.760
you win the virgin by default.

48:26.840 --> 48:28.880
Please return this necklace
to your sister

48:28.960 --> 48:31.960
with my apologies.

48:32.000 --> 48:36.320
He wants me, not the girl.

48:36.400 --> 48:41.280
An unsullied virgin
or a deceitful whore.

48:41.360 --> 48:43.800
I think on this occasion,
you lose.

48:43.880 --> 48:46.840
Would you excuse me
for a moment? Charlotte.

48:52.360 --> 48:55.480
I'm so sorry, I don't know
what that was about.

48:55.560 --> 48:57.520
Shall we carry on as we were?

49:05.880 --> 49:07.760
You're right.

49:07.840 --> 49:10.920
I haven't the stomach for it.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.640
I want to spare the girl.

49:12.760 --> 49:15.640
There's more to it.

49:15.760 --> 49:17.376
I've been watching you
with that imposter,

49:17.400 --> 49:18.800
you're plotting something.

49:18.880 --> 49:24.480
You, him, Lady Fitz.

49:24.560 --> 49:27.320
I want to get the girl out.

49:27.400 --> 49:29.480
Lady Fitz knows nothing of it.

49:39.080 --> 49:40.680
Liar.

49:49.160 --> 49:51.640
Lydia.

49:51.760 --> 49:53.760
Lydia, I'm telling the truth.

49:55.920 --> 49:58.320
Lydia!

49:58.400 --> 50:00.520
Can't you let me out?
