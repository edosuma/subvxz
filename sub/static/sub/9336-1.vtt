00:27.419 --> 00:31.796
<i>When you wish upon a star</i>

00:32.122 --> 00:36.716
<i>Makes no difference
who you are</i>

00:37.045 --> 00:40.973
<i>Anything your heart desires</i>

00:41.259 --> 00:46.948
<i>Will come to you</i>

00:47.272 --> 00:51.549
<i>If your heart
is in your dream</i>

00:51.826 --> 00:56.485
<i>No request is too extreme</i>

00:56.815 --> 01:02.089
<i>When you wish upon a star</i>

01:02.420 --> 01:07.394
<i>As dreamers do</i>

01:07.926 --> 01:11.571
<i>Fate is kind</i>

01:11.947 --> 01:16.456
<i>She brings to those who love</i>

01:16.735 --> 01:20.912
<i>The sweet fulfilment of</i>

01:21.105 --> 01:27.309
<i>Their secret longing</i>

01:32.000 --> 01:37.357
<i>Like a bolt out of the blue</i>

01:37.589 --> 01:39.761
<i>Fate steps in</i>

01:40.092 --> 01:44.933
<i>And sees you through</i>

01:45.313 --> 01:48.233
<i>When you wish</i>

01:48.367 --> 01:51.818
<i>Upon a star</i>

01:52.064 --> 01:55.167
<i>Your dreams</i>

01:55.390 --> 02:02.420
<i>Come true</i>

02:04.021 --> 02:05.978
Pretty, huh?

02:06.584 --> 02:09.072
I'll bet a lot of you folks
don't believe that.

02:09.304 --> 02:12.088
About a wish coming true,
do you?

02:12.466 --> 02:14.258
Well, I didn't either.

02:14.393 --> 02:17.380
Of course, I'm just a cricket
singing my way from hearth to hearth...

02:17.462 --> 02:21.374
...but... let me tell you
what made me change my mind.

02:31.827 --> 02:34.412
One night, a long time...

02:35.202 --> 02:38.494
Pardon me. Wait 'til I, I fix
this thing here.

02:38.665 --> 02:39.865
There.

02:40.368 --> 02:43.520
One night, a long time ago...

02:43.655 --> 02:46.591
...my travels took me to
a quaint little village.

02:46.725 --> 02:48.699
<i>It was a beautiful night.</i>

02:48.857 --> 02:50.880
<i>The stars were shining
like diamonds...</i>

02:50.909 --> 02:54.146
<i>...high above the roofs
of that sleepy old town.</i>

02:54.249 --> 02:56.458
<i>Pretty as a picture.</i>

03:00.972 --> 03:03.078
<i>As I wandered along
the crooked streets...</i>

03:03.175 --> 03:05.363
<i>...there wasn't a soul to be seen.</i>

03:05.494 --> 03:08.032
<i>The only sign of life
was a lighted window...</i>

03:08.203 --> 03:11.654
<i>...in the shop of a wood-carver
named, uh, Geppetto.</i>

03:11.900 --> 03:14.772
<i>So, I hopped over.</i>

03:19.594 --> 03:21.168
<i>And looked in.</i>

03:21.226 --> 03:25.738
<i>It was a shame to see a nice
cheerful fire like that going to waste.</i>

03:26.064 --> 03:27.736
<i>So what do I do?</i>

03:29.434 --> 03:31.508
<i>I go in.</i>

03:35.190 --> 03:37.364
<i>I looked around.</i>

03:39.544 --> 03:41.852
<i>Of course, being in
a strange place like that...</i>

03:42.133 --> 03:44.324
<i>...I didn't know what to expect.</i>

03:44.516 --> 03:47.754
<i>A cricket can't be
too careful, you know.</i>

03:50.655 --> 03:54.556
<i>Soon as I saw there was no one
about, I made myself at home.</i>

04:13.250 --> 04:17.314
<i>As I stood there warming my...
myself, I took a look around.</i>

04:17.423 --> 04:20.760
<i>Well, sir, you never saw
such a place.</i>

04:20.894 --> 04:23.861
<i>The most fantastic clocks
you ever laid your eyes on.</i>

04:24.089 --> 04:26.427
<i>And all carved out of wood.</i>

04:26.558 --> 04:30.508
<i>And cute little music boxes,
each one a work of art.</i>

04:30.646 --> 04:33.518
<i>Shelf after shelf of toys and...</i>

04:34.446 --> 04:36.652
<i>And then something else
caught my eye.</i>

04:36.902 --> 04:38.575
<i>A puppet!</i>

04:38.654 --> 04:40.777
<i>You know, one of those
marionette things...</i>

04:40.906 --> 04:43.080
<i>...all strings and joints.</i>

04:49.392 --> 04:51.351
Cute little fella.

04:51.616 --> 04:54.404
Ding, ding! Going up?

04:58.750 --> 05:00.524
Good piece of wood too.

05:00.792 --> 05:02.499
<i>Well, now.</i>

05:02.828 --> 05:05.633
It won't take much longer.

05:05.964 --> 05:09.811
Just a little more paint
and he's all finished.

05:12.404 --> 05:15.307
I think he'll be all right.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.145
Don't you, Figaro?

05:51.143 --> 05:54.144
Um, huh, uh, beg pardon.

05:59.918 --> 06:01.287
<i>See?</i>

06:01.343 --> 06:04.343
<i>That makes
a big difference.</i>

06:05.145 --> 06:07.016
Very good.

06:08.193 --> 06:11.013
Very, very goo...

06:12.786 --> 06:16.458
Well, you can't
please everybody.

06:19.137 --> 06:22.882
Now, I have just
the name for you.

06:23.308 --> 06:25.295
Pinocchio!

06:26.028 --> 06:28.116
Do you like it, Figaro?

06:30.165 --> 06:32.770
No? You do, don't you, Cleo?

06:34.781 --> 06:38.081
Well, we'll leave it
to little Woodenhead.

06:38.450 --> 06:40.224
Do you like it?

06:43.011 --> 06:45.004
That settles it!

06:45.188 --> 06:47.295
Pinocchio it is!

06:47.424 --> 06:49.813
Come on, now,
we'll try you out.

06:50.123 --> 06:52.297
Music, Professor!

07:03.815 --> 07:07.827
Hey! Ow, ow, ow, ouch!
Ta-Ta-Take it easy there!

07:08.183 --> 07:10.401
Oh, break it up, will you?

07:11.198 --> 07:13.621
Lot of downbeats in there.

07:22.184 --> 07:25.353
<i>Little Woodenhead
Go play your part</i>

07:25.587 --> 07:28.690
<i>Bring a littlejoy
to every heart</i>

07:28.884 --> 07:32.087
<i>Little do you know
and yet it's true</i>

07:32.210 --> 07:35.214
<i>That I'm mighty proud of you</i>

07:35.497 --> 07:38.700
<i>Little wooden feet
and best of all</i>

07:38.834 --> 07:41.954
<i>Little wooden seat
in case you fall</i>

07:42.287 --> 07:44.958
Oh-ho! How graceful!

07:45.340 --> 07:48.889
<i>My little Woodenhead</i>

08:22.204 --> 08:25.170
Cleo, meet Pinocchio.

08:25.539 --> 08:28.112
Say, "How do you do?"

08:32.573 --> 08:35.148
Say hello to Figaro.

08:39.033 --> 08:43.211
Oops! Oh-ho-ho!
Up to mischief already.

08:44.916 --> 08:47.190
You see what happens?

09:02.034 --> 09:03.307
Boo!

09:05.237 --> 09:07.026
Up we go!

09:07.956 --> 09:10.377
You're a cute little fellow.

09:10.659 --> 09:13.726
And that smile?
You know, I....

09:15.502 --> 09:19.482
You rascal. Jealous, huh?

09:19.890 --> 09:25.260
You know, Pinocchio, I think
Figaro is jealous of you.

09:26.558 --> 09:29.930
Oh-ho, don't worry, Figaro.
I sti... Uh-oh.

10:14.681 --> 10:16.916
I wonder what time it is.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.650
It's getting late.

10:24.583 --> 10:27.152
Come, now. We go to bed.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.913
Good night, Pinocchio.

10:30.439 --> 10:32.531
Little funny face.

10:37.679 --> 10:42.007
Good night, Cleo,
my little water baby.

10:48.273 --> 10:50.196
Figaro.

10:50.526 --> 10:53.161
You say good night too.

10:57.366 --> 10:59.123
Go on.

11:06.408 --> 11:09.411
Now go to sleep,
my little mermaid.

11:09.545 --> 11:11.418
Good night.

11:23.475 --> 11:26.131
This is my idea of comfort.

11:28.564 --> 11:30.637
Solid comfort.

11:48.116 --> 11:50.736
Look at him, Figaro.

11:54.136 --> 11:57.039
He almost looks alive.

12:00.445 --> 12:05.170
Wouldn't it be nice
if he was a real boy?

12:05.650 --> 12:07.373
Oh, well.

12:07.883 --> 12:10.983
Come on. We go to sleep.

12:20.422 --> 12:22.230
Ah, Figaro.

12:25.794 --> 12:29.654
I forgot to open the window.

13:04.209 --> 13:09.565
Oh, Figaro! Look, look!
The wishing star!

13:10.065 --> 13:14.291
Star light, star bright,
first star I see tonight;

13:14.719 --> 13:17.954
I wish I may, I wish I might...

13:18.140 --> 13:20.529
...have the wish I make tonight.

13:20.769 --> 13:23.789
Figaro, you know what I wish?

13:27.149 --> 13:29.755
I wish that
my little Pinocchio...

13:29.885 --> 13:32.752
...might be a real boy.

13:33.689 --> 13:36.227
Wouldn't that be nice?
Just think!

13:36.824 --> 13:39.111
A real boy!

13:39.478 --> 13:43.689
A very lovely thought.
But not at all practical.

13:45.881 --> 13:47.855
A real...

13:51.273 --> 13:53.047
...boy.

15:10.052 --> 15:11.793
Quiet!

15:14.413 --> 15:17.204
After all, enough's enough.

15:24.750 --> 15:26.626
Now what's up?

15:36.603 --> 15:38.862
Hey, what's going on here?

15:52.694 --> 15:55.366
As I live and breathe, a fairy!

15:55.547 --> 15:56.956
Mm-mmm.

15:58.834 --> 16:02.648
Good Geppetto, you have given
so much happiness to others.

16:02.862 --> 16:05.997
You deserve to have
your wish come true.

16:09.578 --> 16:11.650
Little puppet made of pine...

16:11.846 --> 16:13.302
...wake.

16:14.266 --> 16:16.638
The gift of life is thine.

16:24.253 --> 16:28.086
Whew! What they can't do
these days!

16:31.400 --> 16:33.309
I can move!

16:34.713 --> 16:36.702
I can talk!

16:37.425 --> 16:39.199
I can walk!

16:41.286 --> 16:45.170
- Yes, Pinocchio, I've given you life.
- Why?

16:45.207 --> 16:48.955
Because tonight, Geppetto
wished for a real boy.

16:49.026 --> 16:52.276
- Am I a real boy?
- No, Pinocchio.

16:52.404 --> 16:56.349
To make Geppetto's wish come
true will be entirely up to you.

16:56.475 --> 16:57.913
Up to me?

16:58.084 --> 17:01.984
Prove yourself brave,
truthful and unselfish...

17:02.339 --> 17:04.602
...and someday you will be a real boy.

17:04.683 --> 17:06.183
A real boy!

17:06.474 --> 17:07.883
That won't be easy.

17:07.970 --> 17:10.642
You must learn to choose
between right and wrong.

17:10.771 --> 17:13.875
Right and wrong?
But how will I know?

17:14.009 --> 17:16.714
- How will he know.
- Your conscience will tell you.

17:16.944 --> 17:20.212
- What are conscience?
- What are conscience!

17:20.339 --> 17:21.914
I'll tell ya!

17:22.162 --> 17:25.976
A conscience is that
still small voice that
people won't listen to.

17:26.688 --> 17:28.955
That's just the trouble
with the world today, you see?

17:29.092 --> 17:31.966
- Are you my conscience?
Who, me?

17:32.294 --> 17:35.794
Would you like to be
Pinocchio's conscience?

17:36.181 --> 17:38.852
Well, w... uh, I...

17:43.335 --> 17:45.756
Very well.
What is your name?

17:46.358 --> 17:49.725
Oh, Cricket's the name.
Jiminy Cricket.

17:50.162 --> 17:53.796
- Kneel, Mr Cricket.
- Huh?

17:54.845 --> 17:56.418
No tricks now.

17:56.577 --> 17:58.886
I dub you
Pinocchio's conscience...

17:59.120 --> 18:01.923
...lord high keeper of the
knowledge of right and wrong...

18:02.157 --> 18:04.495
...counsellor in moments
of temptation...

18:04.650 --> 18:07.604
...and guide along the straight
and narrow path.

18:07.913 --> 18:10.301
Arise, Sir Jiminy Cricket.

18:10.532 --> 18:14.082
Well! Oh-ho-ho!
My, my!

18:14.652 --> 18:18.120
Mmm. Say, that's pretty swell.

18:18.463 --> 18:21.134
Gee... thanks.

18:21.450 --> 18:23.741
But, uh, don't I get
a badge or something?

18:23.954 --> 18:26.689
- Well, we'll see.
- You mean maybe I will?

18:26.865 --> 18:29.237
- I shouldn't wonder.
- Make it a gold one?

18:29.488 --> 18:31.096
Maybe.

18:31.353 --> 18:34.370
Now, remember, Pinocchio,
be a good boy.

18:34.564 --> 18:38.512
And always let your conscience
be your guide.

18:40.045 --> 18:41.588
Goodbye, milady.

18:42.152 --> 18:43.744
Goodbye!

18:48.814 --> 18:50.702
Not bad, says I.

18:50.973 --> 18:54.507
Oh, yeah. Ho-ho-ho.
Almost forgot about you.

18:54.893 --> 18:56.831
Well, Pinoke.

18:57.562 --> 19:00.556
Maybe you and I had better have
a little heart-to-heart talk.

19:00.757 --> 19:01.657
Why?

19:01.713 --> 19:05.082
- Well, you want to be a real boy, don't you?
- Uh-huh!

19:05.587 --> 19:08.388
All right. Sit down, son.

19:11.627 --> 19:15.956
- Now, you see, the world is full of temptations.
- Temptations?

19:16.059 --> 19:17.903
Yep. Temptations.

19:18.066 --> 19:20.788
They're the wrong things
that seem right at the time.

19:20.919 --> 19:25.196
But, uh, even though the right
things may seem wrong sometimes...

19:25.523 --> 19:30.082
...uh, sometimes the, the wrong things
may be right at the wrong time.

19:30.412 --> 19:32.967
Or, uh, visa versa.

19:34.482 --> 19:36.201
Understand?

19:37.952 --> 19:39.909
But I'm gonna do right!

19:40.172 --> 19:43.672
Atta boy, Pinoke.
And I'm gonna help you.

19:43.909 --> 19:46.679
And anytime you need me,
you know, just whistle.

19:47.062 --> 19:48.868
Like this.

19:49.247 --> 19:51.306
Like this?

19:51.401 --> 19:53.228
No, no. Try it again, Pinoke.

19:53.602 --> 19:55.311
Like this?

19:56.815 --> 19:59.121
No, son. Now, listen.

20:04.416 --> 20:07.437
That's it! Come on, now,
let's sing it!

20:09.284 --> 20:12.819
<i>When you get in trouble and
you don't know right from wrong</i>

20:12.954 --> 20:14.647
<i>Give a little whistle</i>

20:15.132 --> 20:17.157
<i>Give a little whistle</i>

20:17.872 --> 20:21.422
<i>When you meet temptation
and the urge is very strong</i>

20:21.630 --> 20:23.453
<i>Give a little whistle</i>

20:23.782 --> 20:25.903
<i>Give a little whistle</i>

20:26.705 --> 20:30.965
<i>Not just a little squeak
Pucker up and blow</i>

20:31.123 --> 20:34.541
<i>- And if your whistle's weak, yell
- Jiminy Cricket?</i>

20:35.246 --> 20:39.058
<i>Right! Take the straight and narrow
path and if you start to slide</i>

20:39.114 --> 20:40.822
<i>Give a little whistle</i>

20:41.149 --> 20:43.056
<i>Give a little whistle</i>

20:43.425 --> 20:46.776
<i>And always let your
conscience be your guide</i>

21:15.294 --> 21:18.828
<i>Take the straight and narrow
path and if you start to slide</i>

21:18.964 --> 21:20.821
<i>Give a little whistle</i>

21:21.189 --> 21:23.445
<i>Give a little whistle
Whoo-hoo!</i>

21:23.635 --> 21:27.662
<i>And always let your
conscience be your guide</i>

21:28.050 --> 21:31.804
<i>And always let your
conscience be your guide</i>

21:38.747 --> 21:41.217
- Who is there?
- It's me!

21:41.610 --> 21:43.517
Oh, it's me.

21:48.050 --> 21:49.926
Shh, Figaro.

21:50.360 --> 21:52.712
There's somebody in here.

22:13.208 --> 22:15.365
Be careful now, Figaro.

22:15.659 --> 22:18.844
He might spring out
on us at any time.

22:34.172 --> 22:36.624
He's in here somewhere.

22:37.150 --> 22:38.624
Here I am!

22:54.516 --> 22:57.834
Oh... Pinocchio.

22:58.570 --> 23:00.840
How did you get down here?

23:01.223 --> 23:04.093
- I fell down.
- Oh, you did.

23:04.376 --> 23:07.275
Ohh! You're talking!

23:07.604 --> 23:10.578
- N-N-N-No!
- Yes, and I can move too!

23:10.686 --> 23:14.346
No, n-no, you, you can't.
I-I'm dreaming in my sleep.

23:14.903 --> 23:17.392
W-W-Wake me up. Wake me up!

23:26.348 --> 23:29.367
Now we see who is dreaming.

23:33.143 --> 23:35.285
Go on. Say something.

23:37.165 --> 23:39.554
Gee, you're funny.
Do it again!

23:39.695 --> 23:43.146
- You do talk!
- Yes, the Blue Fairy came...

23:43.231 --> 23:45.089
The Blue Fairy?

23:45.117 --> 23:47.323
- And I got a conscience.
- A conscience!

23:47.553 --> 23:50.291
And someday I'm gonna
be a real boy!

23:50.422 --> 23:54.422
A real boy! It is my wish.
It's come true!

23:54.659 --> 23:58.768
Figaro, look!
He... He's alive. He can talk!

23:58.997 --> 24:03.500
- Let's say hello to Figaro.
- Hello to Figaro.

24:05.962 --> 24:09.062
Ohh. Oh, Cleo, I almost forgot.

24:09.281 --> 24:12.082
Look! It's Pinocchio!

24:12.613 --> 24:16.277
She's my little water baby.
Isn't she cute?

24:16.665 --> 24:18.373
Yeah, cute.

24:24.473 --> 24:26.943
This calls for a celebration.

24:27.306 --> 24:29.279
Music!

24:30.429 --> 24:32.895
You start one, Pinocchio.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.478
Oh, boy. A party!

24:55.654 --> 24:57.428
Mind if I cut in?

25:01.206 --> 25:04.091
How about sitting out
the next one, babe, huh?

25:04.336 --> 25:08.003
Whoop! Hey, whoa, let me out!
Let me out!

25:13.680 --> 25:16.747
Come, Cleo, join the party.
Dance!

25:19.121 --> 25:20.763
Ooh, nice.

25:24.983 --> 25:26.857
<i>Gathering toys</i>

25:27.819 --> 25:30.275
<i>For my little boy</i>

25:32.908 --> 25:35.444
Look! Pretty!

25:36.078 --> 25:37.572
Help!

25:39.114 --> 25:40.589
Wh-Wh-Wh-Where's the bucket?

25:40.815 --> 25:43.619
Help! Water! Where's the water?

25:43.952 --> 25:46.773
Here it is! I got it!
Here's water! Here's some water!

25:48.114 --> 25:50.450
Help! Where's water?

25:54.245 --> 25:58.039
That was close.
Maybe we'd better go to bed...

25:58.256 --> 26:00.761
...before something else happens.

26:07.559 --> 26:10.630
Little man,
you've had a busy night.

26:18.336 --> 26:22.545
Now, close your eyes
and go to sleep.

26:23.275 --> 26:24.748
Why?

26:25.407 --> 26:28.474
Oh, everybody has to sleep.

26:28.981 --> 26:33.459
Figaro goes to sleep...
and Cleo...

26:34.094 --> 26:38.356
...and besides, tomorrow
you've got to go to school.

26:38.556 --> 26:40.062
Why?

26:40.926 --> 26:44.837
Oh, to learn things and...

26:45.363 --> 26:47.633
...and get smart.

26:48.058 --> 26:49.567
Why?

26:51.336 --> 26:53.171
Because...

27:50.437 --> 27:54.202
- Oh, look, Father! Look!
- Now, wait. Stand still now.

27:54.332 --> 27:57.483
- What are those?
- Huh? Oh, those.

27:57.781 --> 28:01.465
They are your schoolmates.
Girls and boys. Uh, no-now, get in...

28:01.851 --> 28:03.625
- Real boys?
- Yes.

28:03.733 --> 28:07.382
But hurry now.
Oh, oh, wai-wai-wait! Wait. Eh...

28:10.831 --> 28:13.518
Here's an apple for your
teacher. Now turn around...

28:13.610 --> 28:16.211
...and let me look you over.

28:19.126 --> 28:21.148
Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah.

28:21.358 --> 28:23.106
Here.

28:23.437 --> 28:25.037
Run along now.

28:29.718 --> 28:32.335
Fig, wait!
Come back here, Figaro.

28:35.932 --> 28:38.658
School is not for you.

28:39.786 --> 28:41.170
Goodbye, Father.

28:41.271 --> 28:43.171
Goodbye, son.
Hurry back.

28:52.265 --> 28:54.903
Ah, Gideon, listen.
The merry laughter...

28:55.065 --> 28:58.300
...of little innocent children
wending their way to school.

28:58.645 --> 29:02.496
Thirsty little minds rushing
to the fountain of knowledge.

29:03.385 --> 29:06.452
School, a noble institution.

29:06.880 --> 29:09.700
What would this stupid
world be without...

29:11.952 --> 29:15.810
Well, well, well!
Stromboli!

29:15.976 --> 29:19.034
So that old rascal's
back in town, eh?

29:20.535 --> 29:23.109
Remember, Giddy, the time
I tied strings on you...

29:23.326 --> 29:26.558
...and passed you off as a puppet?

29:27.459 --> 29:31.626
We nearly put one over on
that old gypsy that time.

29:35.909 --> 29:39.081
A little wooden boy.
Now, who'd have...

29:39.511 --> 29:41.049
A wooden boy!

29:44.134 --> 29:48.284
Look, Giddy, look!
It's amazing.

29:48.471 --> 29:51.671
A live puppet without strings.

29:51.850 --> 29:54.537
A thing like that ought to be
worth a fortune to someone.

29:54.870 --> 29:57.640
Now let me see.

29:57.973 --> 29:59.846
That's it! Stromboli!

30:00.005 --> 30:03.802
Why, that fat old faker
would give his... Listen.

30:04.104 --> 30:07.871
If we play our cards right,
we'll be on Easy Street...

30:08.008 --> 30:11.141
...or my name isn't Honest John.

30:11.370 --> 30:13.677
Quick, we'll head him off.

30:28.390 --> 30:30.863
Shh! Now's our...

30:32.507 --> 30:34.715
No, no, stupid.

30:35.002 --> 30:37.290
Don't be crude.

30:37.771 --> 30:40.804
Let me handle this.
Here he comes.

30:40.983 --> 30:45.343
Ah, yes, Skinny, as I was saying
to the Duchess only yesterday...

30:45.596 --> 30:47.935
Oh! Oh, how clumsy of me.

30:47.764 --> 30:50.386
Oh, my, my, my, my.

30:51.072 --> 30:53.763
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

30:53.845 --> 30:55.897
Oh, I do hope
you're not injured.

30:56.123 --> 30:59.659
- I'm all right.
- Oh, splendid.

31:01.144 --> 31:03.001
Well, well, hmm.

31:03.130 --> 31:05.318
Quite a scholar, I see.

31:05.515 --> 31:08.399
Look, Giddy, a man of letters.

31:09.886 --> 31:12.275
- Here's your book.
- I'm going to school.

31:12.316 --> 31:14.355
School. Ah, yes.

31:14.604 --> 31:18.436
Then you haven't heard of
the easy road to success.

31:18.637 --> 31:20.410
- Uh-uh.
- No?

31:20.809 --> 31:23.842
I'm speaking, my boy,
of the theatre.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.771
Here's your apple.
Bright lights, music...

31:26.903 --> 31:29.774
...applause, fame!

31:30.036 --> 31:31.876
- Fame?
- Yes!

31:31.975 --> 31:36.307
And with that personality,
that profile, that physique...

31:36.738 --> 31:39.803
...he's a natural born
actor, eh, Giddy?

31:40.333 --> 31:42.439
- But I'm going...
- Straight to the top.

31:42.602 --> 31:46.352
Why, I can see your name
in lights, lights six feet high.

31:46.516 --> 31:48.824
<i>- Uh... What is your name?
- Pinocchio.</i>

31:48.900 --> 31:52.319
Pinocchio! P-I-N... Eh, uh...

31:52.454 --> 31:55.457
...U-O... Eh, P-I... Eh...

31:55.841 --> 31:57.898
We're wasting precious time.

31:58.076 --> 32:00.118
Come, on to the theatre.

32:00.254 --> 32:03.705
<i>Hi diddle dee dee

32:03.996 --> 32:05.988

32:42.762 --> 32:46.909
Late the first day. Oh, well,
he can't get in much trouble...

32:47.009 --> 32:49.451
...between here and school.

32:51.254 --> 32:54.223

Shh!

33:33.230 --> 33:35.851
Why, my boy, huh, you
must be seeing things.

33:35.933 --> 33:38.174
Oh, no, that's
my conscience. He...

33:38.460 --> 33:41.629
Now, now, now.
Just calm down.

33:41.813 --> 33:45.713
Why, there's nothing
up there to be afraid of.

33:46.443 --> 33:48.815
Oh!

33:59.156 --> 34:01.029
Psst! Pinoke!

34:01.158 --> 34:04.591
Psst! Pinoke! Over here.

34:07.798 --> 34:11.663
- I'm going to be an actor.
- All right, son, take it easy now.

34:12.112 --> 34:13.688
Remember what I said
about temptation?

34:13.804 --> 34:16.690
- Uh-huh.
- Well, that's him.

34:16.822 --> 34:20.505
Oh, no, Jiminy,
that's Mr Honest John.

34:20.635 --> 34:22.440
Honest John?

34:24.273 --> 34:28.516
Get this thing off.
Get me outta here!

34:35.199 --> 34:37.656
Get me out of here!

34:45.043 --> 34:47.202
Oh!

34:51.231 --> 34:53.503
All right then, here's
what we'll tell 'em:

34:53.714 --> 34:56.880
You can't go to the theatre,
say "Thank you just the same"...

34:57.189 --> 35:00.273
...you're sorry but you've
got to go to school.

35:01.340 --> 35:03.260

Now, you tell 'em.

35:12.125 --> 35:14.502
Oh, little boy!
Ah, there you are!

35:14.889 --> 35:19.119
Now, where were we?
Ah, yes, on to the theatre!

35:19.352 --> 35:21.241
Goodbye, Jiminy!
Goodbye!

<i>- An actor's life is gay

35:34.301 --> 35:36.709
I'll go after him myself.

35:42.326 --> 35:45.143
Ladies and gentlemen...

35:45.436 --> 35:48.421
...to conclude the performance
of this great show...

35:48.612 --> 35:53.755
...Stromboli the Master Showman...
that's a-me...

35:53.862 --> 35:57.096

36:02.813 --> 36:06.546
...you will absolutely
refuse to believe.

36:07.668 --> 36:09.791
Well, looks like a sell-out.

36:09.920 --> 36:13.353
Introducing
the only marionette...

36:13.482 --> 36:15.624
...who can sing and dance...

36:15.759 --> 36:20.506
...absolutely without
the aids of strings.

36:21.223 --> 36:23.496
I hope so.

36:24.104 --> 36:28.713
The one and only... Pinocchio!

36:29.415 --> 36:32.402
Hmph! What a build-up.

36:42.874 --> 36:46.125
<i>I got no strings
to hold me dow...</i>

36:50.205 --> 36:52.674
Go ahead, make a fool
of yourself.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.003
Then maybe you'll listen
to your conscience.

37:03.373 --> 37:05.445
Cute kid.

37:10.864 --> 37:13.255
<i>I got no strings
to hold me down</i>

37:13.442 --> 37:16.015
<i>To make me fret

37:16.153 --> 37:18.644
<i>I had strings

37:26.855 --> 37:29.546
<i>I want the world to know</i>

37:29.683 --> 37:31.974
<i>Nothing ever worries me</i>

37:32.211 --> 37:33.950
<i>I got no strings
so I can have fun</i>

37:34.101 --> 37:37.355
<i>- What I told you, huh?
- I'm not tied up with anyone</i>

37:37.566 --> 37:39.957
<i>They got strings
but you can see</i>

37:40.093 --> 37:42.763
<i>There are no strings on me</i>

37:50.012 --> 37:52.633
<i>You have no strings
Your arms is free</i>

37:52.814 --> 37:55.236

<i>Ja, ja, ja
If you would woo</i>

37:57.719 --> 37:59.777
<i>I'd bust my strings for you</i>

38:14.837 --> 38:16.776
<i>You got no strings

<i>I'd cut my strings for you</i>

38:40.863 --> 38:43.135
<i>Down where the Volga flows</i>

38:43.265 --> 38:45.505
<i>There's a Russian rendezvous</i>

38:45.634 --> 38:47.757
<i>Where me and Ivan go</i>

38:47.886 --> 38:49.506
<i>But I'd rather go with you</i>

38:49.607 --> 38:50.907
Hey!

38:52.875 --> 38:55.579
Hey!

38:55.711 --> 38:58.546
Hey!

39:24.489 --> 39:27.027
<i>There are no strings on me</i>

39:36.852 --> 39:38.924
Hmm, they like him.

39:39.354 --> 39:40.928
He's a success.

39:41.056 --> 39:44.210
Gosh, maybe I was wrong.

39:54.686 --> 39:58.965
Well, guess he won't
need me any more.

39:59.249 --> 40:01.867
What does an actor want
with a conscience anyway?

40:09.993 --> 40:12.880
What could have happened to him?

40:14.840 --> 40:17.875
Where could he be at this hour?

40:19.253 --> 40:22.337
I'd better go out again
and look for him.

40:26.653 --> 40:31.683
And remember, nobody eats
a bite until I find him.

40:56.498 --> 40:57.909
<i>I got-a no strings
but I got-a the brain</i>

40:57.958 --> 41:00.745
<i>I buy a new suit
and I swing-a the chain</i>

41:00.878 --> 41:03.832
<i>I eat-a the best
and I drink-a champagne</i>

41:03.964 --> 41:06.289
<i>I got-a no strings on me</i>

41:08.743 --> 41:11.561
- Bravo, Pinocchio!
- They like me.

41:11.622 --> 41:13.779
Hmm, two hundred.

41:13.957 --> 41:17.207
- You are sensational!
- Ya mean I'm good?

41:17.336 --> 41:20.355
Ahh, three hundred.

41:20.489 --> 41:23.194
You are colossal!

41:23.275 --> 41:26.342
Does that mean I'm an actor?

41:26.470 --> 41:30.515
Sure. I will push you
in the public's eye.

41:30.741 --> 41:34.238
Your face, she will be
on everybody's tongue.

41:34.670 --> 41:37.640
- Will she?
- Ye... Uh, huh?

41:37.773 --> 41:39.846
What's this?

41:47.182 --> 41:48.790
Ahhh!

41:49.148 --> 41:53.377
For you, my little Pinocchio.

41:53.580 --> 41:55.922
For me? Gee, thanks!

41:56.113 --> 41:59.233
I'll run right home
and tell my father.

42:00.729 --> 42:02.620
Home?

42:02.857 --> 42:06.344
Oh, sure. Going home
to your father.

42:07.302 --> 42:09.444
Oh, that is very comical!

42:09.600 --> 42:13.467
- Ya mean it's funny?
- Oh, sure! Yes.

42:13.584 --> 42:16.934
- I'll be back in the morning.
- Be back in the morning.

42:18.093 --> 42:19.900
Going home.

42:26.280 --> 42:29.596
There, this will be your home...

42:29.825 --> 42:32.316
...where I can find you always.

42:32.553 --> 42:35.856
- No, no, no!
- Yes, yes, yes!

42:36.000 --> 42:39.265
To me you are belonging.

42:39.485 --> 42:41.477
We will tour the world.

42:41.712 --> 42:43.984
Paris. London.

42:44.214 --> 42:48.710
Monte Carlo.
"Constantinopolee."

42:48.944 --> 42:51.745
- No, no!
- Yes!

42:51.972 --> 42:54.997
We start tonight!

42:56.159 --> 42:58.448
Hmm.

42:58.779 --> 43:02.875
You will make lots of money...

43:03.263 --> 43:04.871
for me!

43:05.303 --> 43:09.481
And when you are
growing too old...

43:09.748 --> 43:13.559
...you will make good... firewood!

43:15.762 --> 43:18.913
Let me outta here! I gotta
get out! You can't keep me!

43:19.041 --> 43:21.430
Quiet! Shut-a up...

43:21.560 --> 43:24.763
...before I knock-a you silly!

43:26.231 --> 43:28.371
Good night...

43:29.484 --> 43:32.870
...my little wooden gold mine.

43:37.765 --> 43:40.819
No! No, wait! Let me out!

43:40.996 --> 43:43.513
I'll tell my father!

43:43.941 --> 43:47.660
Giddy-up!
Get along there.

43:53.025 --> 43:54.679
Jiminy!

43:54.780 --> 43:56.580
Oh, Jiminy!

43:57.513 --> 44:00.119
Oh, Jiminy, where are ya?

44:01.333 --> 44:03.575
Jiminy Cricket!

44:24.064 --> 44:26.162
Well, there he goes.

44:26.437 --> 44:30.260
Sitting in the lap of luxury,
the world at his feet.

44:30.446 --> 44:34.061
Oh, well, I can always
say I knew him when.

44:36.601 --> 44:40.038
I'll just go out
of his life quietly.

44:46.124 --> 44:48.611
I would like to
wish him luck though.

44:48.764 --> 44:51.236
Sure! Why not?

44:59.473 --> 45:01.080
Pinocchio.

45:02.107 --> 45:03.949
Pinocchio!

45:04.480 --> 45:07.080
It's me, your old friend Jiminy,
remember?

45:07.315 --> 45:10.482
Jiminy! Gee, I'm glad to see ya!

45:10.644 --> 45:13.813
Pinocchio!
What's happened?

45:14.740 --> 45:17.247
- What did he do to ya?
- Oh, he was mad.

45:17.384 --> 45:19.822
He said he was gonna push
my face in everybody's eye.

45:19.953 --> 45:22.195
- Yeah?
- A-A-And just 'cause I'm a gold brick...

45:22.331 --> 45:24.803
...he-he's gonna chop me
into firewood!

45:24.853 --> 45:28.353
Oh, is that so?
Now, don't you worry, son.

45:28.562 --> 45:31.612
I'll have you out of here
in no time at all.

45:31.940 --> 45:36.567
Why, this is... eh, just as
easy as... rollin' off a...

45:45.260 --> 45:47.368
Kind of rusty.

45:49.775 --> 45:54.620
- Needs a little oil!
- Needs a little oil, needs a little oil, a little oil.

45:54.685 --> 45:56.754
That's what I said.

46:06.892 --> 46:09.113
Must be one of the old models.

46:09.345 --> 46:11.484
You mean, you can't open it?

46:11.753 --> 46:13.341
Yeah.

46:14.833 --> 46:17.041
Looks pretty hopeless.

46:17.411 --> 46:19.583
It'll take a miracle
to get us out of here.

46:19.680 --> 46:21.286
Gee.

46:23.058 --> 46:24.798
Pinocchio!

46:26.561 --> 46:28.684
Pinocchio!

46:40.259 --> 46:42.198
Giddy-up!

46:51.270 --> 46:53.176
Pinocch...

47:00.971 --> 47:03.842
A fine conscience
I turned out to be.

47:04.174 --> 47:06.465
I should've listened
to you, Jiminy.

47:06.652 --> 47:08.815
No, it was my fault.

47:08.916 --> 47:10.916
I shouldn't have walked out on you.

47:11.120 --> 47:14.323
Guess I'll never see
my father again.

47:16.116 --> 47:18.405
Oh, buck up, son.

47:18.505 --> 47:22.935
It could be worse.
Be cheerful, like me.

47:28.482 --> 47:32.130
Aw, take it easy, son.

47:32.241 --> 47:35.532
Come on, blow.

47:36.356 --> 47:38.445
Thatta boy.

47:41.612 --> 47:44.829
Oh, well, it stopped
raining anyway.

47:46.475 --> 47:49.742
Hey, that star again!
Uh, the lady, the... Ooh!

47:49.870 --> 47:52.957
- The fairy!
- What'll she say?

47:54.208 --> 47:58.122
- What'll I tell her?
- You might tell her the truth.

48:06.703 --> 48:10.617
- Why, Pinocchio.
- Uh, eh, hello!

48:10.682 --> 48:12.556
Sir Jiminy!

48:12.684 --> 48:16.764
Well! Uh, this is a...
a pleasant surprise. Ha-ha.

48:17.147 --> 48:19.782
Pinocchio, why didn't
you go to school?

48:19.958 --> 48:23.316
School? Well, I... um...

48:23.517 --> 48:24.817
Uh... Go ahead, tell her.

48:24.897 --> 48:27.767
I was going to school
'til I met somebody.

48:27.850 --> 48:31.582
<i>- Met somebody?
- Yeah. Uh, two big monsters...</i>

48:31.852 --> 48:34.524
...with big green eyes!

48:36.091 --> 48:38.761
- Why, I... I...
- Monsters?

48:38.929 --> 48:40.361
Weren't you afraid?

48:40.462 --> 48:43.162
No, ma'am.
But they tied me in a big sack.

48:45.250 --> 48:48.585
<i>You don't say!
And where was Sir Jiminy?</i>

48:48.720 --> 48:51.390
Eh, huh? Oh, Jiminy?

48:51.637 --> 48:53.660
Hey, psst!
Leave me outta this.

48:53.867 --> 48:56.223
They put him in a little sack.

48:56.408 --> 48:59.509
- No!
- Yeah!

48:59.731 --> 49:01.869
<i>- How did you escape?
- I didn't.</i>

49:02.000 --> 49:04.405
They chopped me into firewood.

49:07.264 --> 49:09.221
Oh! Oh, look!

49:09.449 --> 49:11.954
My nose!
What's happened?

49:12.186 --> 49:14.427
Perhaps you haven't been
telling the truth, Pinocchio.

49:14.763 --> 49:18.791
- "Perhaps"?
- Oh, but I have, every single word.

49:23.739 --> 49:27.024
Oh, please help me!
I'm awful sorry.

49:27.324 --> 49:31.174
You see, Pinocchio, a lie
keeps growing and growing...

49:31.346 --> 49:33.453
...until it's as plain as
the nose on your face.

49:33.532 --> 49:35.874
She's right, Pinoke.
You better come clean.

49:35.959 --> 49:38.960
I'll never lie again.
Honest, I won't.

49:39.188 --> 49:42.557
Please, Your Honor...
Uh, uh, I mean, Miss Fairy.

49:42.691 --> 49:45.047
Give him another chance,
for my sake.

49:45.207 --> 49:47.712
Will ya, huh?

49:48.113 --> 49:51.084
I'll forgive you this once.
But remember...

49:51.156 --> 49:55.635
...a boy who won't be good might
just as well be made of wood.

49:55.729 --> 49:58.118
- We'll be good, won't we?
- We'll be good, won't we?

49:58.348 --> 50:02.131
Very well. But this is
the last time I can help you.

50:07.616 --> 50:10.337
Gee, look, Jiminy, my nose!

50:10.469 --> 50:13.386
Hey, we're free!
Come on, Pinoke!

50:13.514 --> 50:16.514
<i>I buy a new suit
and I swing-a the cane</i>

50:16.642 --> 50:19.596
<i>I eat-a the fish
and I drink-a champagne</i>

50:19.728 --> 50:22.219
<i>I got no strings on me</i>

50:22.156 --> 50:24.514
- Toodle-ooo, Stromboli.
- Goodbye, Mr Strombo...

50:24.650 --> 50:28.730
Shh! Quiet! Let's get outta here
before something else happens.

50:37.538 --> 50:41.322
<i>Hi diddle dee dee
An actor's life for me</i>

50:41.458 --> 50:43.451
<i>A high silk hat
and a silver cane</i>

50:43.585 --> 50:45.625
<i>A watch of gold
with a diamond chain</i>

50:45.754 --> 50:49.289
<i>Hi diddle dee day
An actor's life is gay</i>

50:49.424 --> 50:51.464
<i>It's great to be a celebrity</i>

50:51.593 --> 50:54.843
<i>An actor's life for me</i>

50:55.072 --> 50:58.141
And the dummy fell for it...

50:58.475 --> 51:00.883
...hook, line and sinker!

51:04.706 --> 51:08.456
And he still thinks
we're his friends.

51:09.344 --> 51:11.752
And did Stromboli pay...

51:12.089 --> 51:14.262
...plenty!

51:16.885 --> 51:20.650
That shows you how low
Honest John will stoop...

51:20.831 --> 51:22.438
...eh, Giddy?

51:26.169 --> 51:28.777
Now, uh, coachman...

51:30.841 --> 51:32.715
...what's your proposition?

51:32.843 --> 51:36.046
Well...

51:36.080 --> 51:40.645
...how would you blokes like
to make some real money?

51:41.355 --> 51:45.605
Well! And who do we
have to, eh...

51:46.323 --> 51:48.007
No, no!

51:48.238 --> 51:50.038
Nothing like that.

51:50.194 --> 51:51.994
You see...

51:56.783 --> 52:00.018
I'm collecting
stupid little boys.

52:00.454 --> 52:03.123
- Stupid little boys?
- You know...

52:03.248 --> 52:06.768
...the disobedient ones what
play hookey from school.

52:08.272 --> 52:10.189
And you see...

52:13.442 --> 52:15.333
Yes.

52:15.969 --> 52:18.341
Oh!

52:26.180 --> 52:28.653
And I takes 'em
to Pleasure Island!

52:28.807 --> 52:31.594
Ah, Pleasure Island.

52:31.790 --> 52:34.561
Pleasure Island?
But the law, suppose they...

52:34.863 --> 52:38.315
No, no. There is no risk.

52:38.550 --> 52:41.636
They never come back...

52:41.970 --> 52:44.461
...as boys!

52:51.004 --> 52:54.539
Now, I've got a coach load
leaving at midnight.

52:54.775 --> 52:57.960
We'll meet at the crossroads,
and no double-crossing!

52:58.095 --> 52:59.838
- No, sir.
- Scout around...

52:59.972 --> 53:02.623
...and any good prospects
you find, bring 'em to me.

53:02.670 --> 53:04.280
- Yes, Chief.
- I'll pay you well.

53:04.393 --> 53:07.099
- I got plenty of gold.
- Yes, yes.

53:07.402 --> 53:11.599
No, sir, nothing can stop me now.
I'll make good this time.

53:11.761 --> 53:14.712
- You'd better.
- I will. I'm going to school.

53:14.801 --> 53:18.468
- That's the stuff, Pinoke.
- I'd rather be smart than be an actor.

53:18.583 --> 53:22.830
Now you're talkin'! Come on,
slowpoke, I'll race ya home.

53:29.406 --> 53:33.090
Well, well, Pinocchio.
What's your rush?

53:33.322 --> 53:36.093
I gotta beat Jiminy home.
Oh, hello.

53:36.275 --> 53:38.513
Well, how is the great actor?

53:38.644 --> 53:41.930
I don't wanna be an actor.
Stromboli was terrible.

53:42.064 --> 53:44.900
- He was?
- Yeah, he locked me in a bird cage...

53:45.026 --> 53:47.896
- He did?
- Uh-huh, but I learned my lesson.

53:48.129 --> 53:49.026
I'm going...

53:49.149 --> 53:52.049
Oh, you poor, poor boy.
You must be a nervous wreck.

53:52.318 --> 53:55.753
That's it, you are
a nervous wreck!

53:55.828 --> 53:58.450
We must diagnose
this case at once.

53:58.681 --> 54:00.753
Quick, Doctor, your notebook.

54:02.718 --> 54:05.292
<i>Bless my soul.</i>

54:05.379 --> 54:08.167
Hmmm, mm-hmm.

54:08.554 --> 54:11.919
My, my.
Just as I thought.

54:12.094 --> 54:14.002
A slight touch of
monetary complications...

54:14.060 --> 54:17.079
...with bucolic semi-lunar contraptions
of the flying trapezes.

54:18.559 --> 54:21.477
Mm-hmm. Say "hippopotamus."

54:21.604 --> 54:24.356
- Hi-ho-hotamus.
- I knew it!

54:24.482 --> 54:26.605
Compound transmission of the
pandemonium with percussion...

54:26.734 --> 54:29.770
...and spasmodic
frantic disintegration.

54:29.904 --> 54:32.193
- Close your eyes. What do you see?
- Nothing.

54:32.323 --> 54:34.861
- Open them. Now what do you see?
- Spots.

54:34.992 --> 54:38.557
Aha! Now that heart.

54:38.828 --> 54:42.476
Ooh, my goodness!

54:42.667 --> 54:45.158
A palpitating syncopation
of the killer diller...

54:45.294 --> 54:48.165
...with the wicky wacky
stomping of the floy joy.

54:48.297 --> 54:50.539
Quick, Doctor, that report.

54:50.675 --> 54:54.174
Ooh, this makes it
perfectly clear!

54:55.506 --> 54:59.867
My boy, you are allergic.

55:00.059 --> 55:03.226
- Allergic?
- Yes, and there is only one cure.

55:03.354 --> 55:07.482
- A vacation on Pleasure Island!
- Pleasure Island?

55:07.608 --> 55:10.099
Yes, that happy land
of carefree boys...

55:10.236 --> 55:12.442
...where every day is a holiday!

55:12.572 --> 55:16.439
- But I can't go. I...
- Why, of course you can go.

55:16.576 --> 55:19.197
I'm giving you my ticket.

55:21.372 --> 55:23.945
- Here.
- Thanks! But I'm...

55:24.183 --> 55:28.330
Oh, tut-tut-tut-tut, I insist.
Your health comes first.

55:28.506 --> 55:32.006
Come, the coach
departs at midnight.

55:32.091 --> 55:35.840
<i>Hi diddle dee dee
It's Pleasure Isle for me</i>

55:35.970 --> 55:37.844
<i>Where every day is a holiday</i>

55:37.972 --> 55:40.012
<i>And kids have nothing
to do but play</i>

55:40.241 --> 55:41.950
<i>Pinoke!</i>

55:42.315 --> 55:45.847
Oh, Pinoke? Now where
do you suppose he... Huh?

55:46.147 --> 55:49.064
Pinocchio!
Hey! Come back!

55:57.283 --> 55:59.240
Giddy-up!

56:02.538 --> 56:05.325
Well...

56:05.558 --> 56:07.993
...here we go again.

56:09.506 --> 56:12.193
My name's Lampwick.
What's yours?

56:12.381 --> 56:14.221
Pinocchio.

56:14.470 --> 56:17.820
- Ever been to Pleasure Island?
- Uh-uh, but Mr Honest John gave me...

56:17.929 --> 56:22.009
Me neither, but they say it's a
swell joint. No school, no cops.

56:22.141 --> 56:25.344
You can tear the joint apart,
and nobody says a word.

56:25.478 --> 56:29.855
- Honest John gave me...
- Loaf around, plenty to eat, plenty to drink.

56:29.982 --> 56:32.141
- And it's all free!
- Honest John...

56:32.276 --> 56:36.144
Boy, that's the place.
I can hardly wait!

57:13.860 --> 57:15.733
<i>Right here, boys!
Right here!</i>

57:15.862 --> 57:18.732
<i>Get your cake, pie,
dill pickles and ice cream.</i>

57:18.865 --> 57:22.068
<i>Eat all you can. Be a glutton.
Stuff yourselves.</i>

57:22.201 --> 57:26.246
It's all free, boys. It's all free.
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

57:26.472 --> 57:28.346
The Rough House.
The Rough House.

57:28.474 --> 57:31.428
It's the roughest, toughest
joint ya ever seen.

57:31.515 --> 57:35.216
- Come in and pick a fight, boys.
- Oh, boy, a scrap!

57:35.398 --> 57:37.421
Come on, let's go in
and poke somebody in the nose.

57:37.550 --> 57:39.875
- Why?
- Ah, just for the fun of it.

57:40.111 --> 57:42.299
Okay, Lampy.

57:44.015 --> 57:45.675
<i>Tobacco Road. Tobacco Road.</i>

57:45.808 --> 57:48.346
<i>Get your cigars, cigarettes
and chewin' tobacco.</i>

57:48.478 --> 57:51.562
<i>Come in and smoke your heads off.
There's nobody here to stop you.</i>

57:51.833 --> 57:53.709
Pinocchio!

57:54.055 --> 57:57.537
Pinocchio! There's somethin'...
phoney about all this.

57:57.812 --> 57:59.569
I gotta get him outta here.

57:59.697 --> 58:02.105
<i>Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry,
hurry! See the model home.</i>

58:02.241 --> 58:05.575
<i>It's open for destruction,
and it's all yours, boys!</i>

58:05.703 --> 58:08.111
<i>It's all yours!</i>

58:11.918 --> 58:14.622
What'd I tell ya?
Ain't this a swell joint?

58:14.754 --> 58:17.874
Yeah! Bein' bad's
a lot of fun, ain't it?

58:18.277 --> 58:21.280
Yeah, uh-huh. Get a load of
that stained-glass window.

58:26.265 --> 58:29.800
All right now,
hop to it, you blokes.

58:30.191 --> 58:33.860
Come on, come on! Shut the doors
and lock 'em tight.

58:35.041 --> 58:38.985
Now get below and get
them crates ready.

58:39.211 --> 58:43.705
Give a bad boy enough rope
and he'll soon make a jackass of himself.

58:51.287 --> 58:53.907
Pinocchio!

58:54.460 --> 58:56.749
Pinocchio?

59:00.733 --> 59:03.058
Where is everybody?

59:05.738 --> 59:08.176
The place is like a graveyard.

59:08.307 --> 59:10.845
I don't like the looks of this.

59:11.077 --> 59:13.149
Pinocchio!

59:15.857 --> 59:18.229
Hey, where are you?

59:34.934 --> 59:37.372
Where d'you suppose all
the kids went to, Lampwick?

59:37.553 --> 59:41.356
Ah, they're around here
somewheres. What do you care?

59:43.593 --> 59:47.673
- You're having a good time, ain't ya?
- Uh-huh, I sure am.

59:47.805 --> 59:51.055
Oh, boy! This is the life,
huh, Pinoky?

59:51.284 --> 59:53.091
Yeah!

59:53.728 --> 59:56.017
It sure is!

59:56.147 --> 59:58.519
Ah, you smoke
like me grandmother!

59:59.734 --> 01:00:03.518
Come on, take
a big drag like this.

01:00:05.948 --> 01:00:08.439
Okay, Lampy.

01:00:25.706 --> 01:00:28.358
Some fun, huh, kid?

01:00:28.734 --> 01:00:31.786
Okay, Slats, your shot.

01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:49.135
<i>What's the matter, Slats?
Losin' your grip?</i>

01:00:51.577 --> 01:00:55.527
<i>Pinocchio! So this is
where I find you.</i>

01:00:55.815 --> 01:00:58.384
How do you ever expect
to be a real boy?

01:00:58.559 --> 01:01:01.081
Look at yourself. Smoking...

01:01:01.212 --> 01:01:04.960
...playing pool! Ow! You are coming
right home with me this minute!

01:01:05.091 --> 01:01:07.760
Hey! Who's the beetle?

01:01:07.945 --> 01:01:10.930
Let go! Put me down!
Let me out of here. Let me out!

01:01:11.097 --> 01:01:14.264
He's my conscience. He tells me
what's right and wrong.

01:01:14.392 --> 01:01:18.852
What? You mean to tell me you
take orders from a grasshopper?

01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:22.230
Grasshopper? Look here,
you, you impudent young pup!

01:01:22.358 --> 01:01:24.481
It wouldn't hurt you to take
orders from your grasshopp...

01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:26.817
...your conscience,
if you have one.

01:01:27.106 --> 01:01:30.209
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
Screwball in the corner pocket.

01:01:41.786 --> 01:01:44.337
Why... Why... Ya young hoodlum!

01:01:44.523 --> 01:01:47.774
I'll... I'll knock your block off!

01:01:52.847 --> 01:01:54.721
Why, I'll take you apart
and put you back together.

01:01:54.849 --> 01:01:57.470
Oh, don't hurt him, Jiminy.
He's my best friend.

01:01:57.602 --> 01:02:00.935
Why, I'll... Your best friend?

01:02:01.203 --> 01:02:04.604
And what am I?
Just your conscience.

01:02:05.585 --> 01:02:08.936
Okay, that settles it.

01:02:09.371 --> 01:02:13.071
- But, Jiminy...
- You buttered your bread, now sleep in it.

01:02:21.112 --> 01:02:23.270
Ha-ha-ha!
Go on, laugh.

01:02:23.366 --> 01:02:27.280
Make a jackass out of yourself.
I'm through! This is the end.

01:02:27.421 --> 01:02:30.956
But, Jiminy, Lampwick says
a guy only lives once.

01:02:31.052 --> 01:02:32.879
Lampwick. Hmph!

01:02:33.012 --> 01:02:36.166
Come on, come on.
Let him go.

01:02:40.424 --> 01:02:42.897
Lampwick. Hmph, Lampwick!

01:02:44.053 --> 01:02:48.098
Burns me up. After all
I tried to do for him.

01:02:48.324 --> 01:02:52.802
Who's his conscience anyway?
Me or that, that hoodlum Lampwick?

01:02:53.107 --> 01:02:55.842
I've had enough of this.
I'm taking the next boat out of here.

01:02:56.018 --> 01:02:58.041
Open up that door!
Open up!

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.493
I wanna go home!

01:03:05.503 --> 01:03:08.469
<i>Come on, you blokes!
Keep 'em moving!</i>

01:03:08.648 --> 01:03:12.462
Lively there now.
We haven't got all night.

01:03:15.755 --> 01:03:18.128
Where'd all the
donkeys come from?

01:03:18.266 --> 01:03:20.757
Come on, come on.
Let's have another.

01:03:22.436 --> 01:03:25.671
And what's your name?

01:03:26.047 --> 01:03:29.730
Okay, you'll do!
In you go!

01:03:29.969 --> 01:03:33.404
You boys'll bring a nice price.

01:03:33.729 --> 01:03:36.067
All right, next!

01:03:36.214 --> 01:03:39.914
- And what might your name be?
- Alexander.

01:03:40.096 --> 01:03:42.617
Hmm, so you can talk.

01:03:42.748 --> 01:03:47.292
Ye-Yes, sir. I wanna
go home to my mama!

01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:50.825
Take him back!
He can still talk!

01:03:51.591 --> 01:03:55.291
Please, please!
I don't wanna be a donkey!

01:03:55.428 --> 01:03:57.883
- Let me outta here!
- Quiet!

01:03:58.214 --> 01:04:02.242
You boys have had your fun.
Now pay for it.

01:04:02.368 --> 01:04:06.811
"Boys"? So that's what...
Pinocchio!

01:04:07.064 --> 01:04:10.647
Ha! To hear that beetle talk...

01:04:10.776 --> 01:04:15.070
...you'd think somethin'
was going to happen to us.

01:04:18.743 --> 01:04:21.234
Conscience. Nah, phooey!

01:04:27.668 --> 01:04:29.808
Where does he get that stuff?

01:04:30.037 --> 01:04:33.223
"How do you ever expect
to be a real boy?"

01:04:33.457 --> 01:04:36.840
What's he think
I look like, a jackass?

01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:39.425
You sure do!

01:04:42.158 --> 01:04:44.996
Hey, you laugh like a donkey.

01:04:48.581 --> 01:04:50.986
Did that come out of me?

01:04:53.444 --> 01:04:55.520
Oh!

01:04:55.695 --> 01:04:57.737
Huh?

01:04:59.408 --> 01:05:01.648
What the...
What's goin' on?

01:05:04.697 --> 01:05:07.451
I've been double-crossed!
Help! Help!

01:05:07.583 --> 01:05:11.183
Somebody, help!
I've been framed! Help!

01:05:11.432 --> 01:05:14.517
Please, you gotta help me.
Oh, be a pal.

01:05:14.632 --> 01:05:17.123
Call that beetle!
Call anybody!

01:05:20.221 --> 01:05:24.698
Mama! Mama!

01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:45.444
- Oh, what's happened?
- I hope I'm not too late.

01:05:46.122 --> 01:05:48.827
What'll I do?

01:05:51.994 --> 01:05:55.293
- Pinocchio!
- Jiminy! Oh, Jiminy, help!

01:05:55.423 --> 01:05:58.543
Wait, Pinoke! The kids,
the boys, they're all donkeys!

01:05:58.676 --> 01:06:00.865
Oh, you too!

01:06:01.015 --> 01:06:03.706
Come on, quick!
Before you get any worse.

01:06:05.575 --> 01:06:08.379
This way, Pinoke.
It's the only way out.

01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:19.664
Hurry up... before they see us.

01:06:21.816 --> 01:06:24.023
You gotta jump!

01:06:42.511 --> 01:06:44.729
Jiminy.

01:06:45.306 --> 01:06:48.951
Jiminy, y-you all right?

01:06:49.477 --> 01:06:52.561
Sure. I thought
we'd never make it.

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:57.311
Certainly feels good
to be back on...

01:06:57.443 --> 01:06:59.948
...dry land.

01:07:00.379 --> 01:07:02.917
Come on, let's get home.

01:07:04.033 --> 01:07:06.073
Father! Father, I'm home!

01:07:06.202 --> 01:07:09.867
- We're home, Mr Geppetto! Home again!
- It's me, Pinocchio!

01:07:09.997 --> 01:07:14.624
- I'm home to stay!
- Here he is, Mr Geppetto. Home at last.

01:07:14.752 --> 01:07:17.955
Hey, maybe he's asleep.

01:07:19.994 --> 01:07:22.450
Father! Father, it's me!

01:07:24.178 --> 01:07:27.245
Pinoke, come here.

01:07:27.573 --> 01:07:30.474
Look. He ain't here.

01:07:30.601 --> 01:07:33.538
He... He's gone.

01:07:33.771 --> 01:07:35.978
Yeah, and Figaro.

01:07:36.107 --> 01:07:38.432
And Cleo too.

01:07:42.989 --> 01:07:45.693
Maybe something awful
happened to him.

01:07:45.925 --> 01:07:49.324
Don't worry, son,
he probably hasn't gone far.

01:07:57.086 --> 01:07:59.077
Hey.

01:07:59.714 --> 01:08:01.587
- It's a message.
- What's it say?

01:08:01.716 --> 01:08:04.123
- It's about your father.
- Where is he?

01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:06.336
Why, uh, uh,
it says here he, uh...

01:08:06.471 --> 01:08:09.839
...he went looking for you and, uh,
uh, he was swallowed by a whale.

01:08:10.074 --> 01:08:14.885
- Swallowed by a whale?
- Yeah, uh-huh. A... A whale?

01:08:15.221 --> 01:08:17.393
- A whale named Monstro.
- Oh, he's...

01:08:17.723 --> 01:08:19.599
But, but wait.
He's alive.

01:08:19.734 --> 01:08:21.477
- Alive? Where?
- Why, uh, uh...

01:08:21.611 --> 01:08:24.279
...inside the whale at the,
at the bottom of the sea.

01:08:24.404 --> 01:08:28.087
- Bottom of the sea?
- Uh-huh. Uh... Hey! Where you going?

01:08:28.267 --> 01:08:30.374
I'm going to find him.

01:08:30.453 --> 01:08:32.492
But, Pinoke, are you crazy?

01:08:32.721 --> 01:08:34.947
Don't you realize,
uh, he's in a whale?

01:08:35.142 --> 01:08:37.349
I've gotta go to him.

01:08:37.518 --> 01:08:39.707
Hey, Pinoke, wait!

01:08:39.970 --> 01:08:42.078
Listen here, son.

01:08:44.233 --> 01:08:46.209
But this Monstro,
I've heard of him.

01:08:46.344 --> 01:08:48.216
He's a whale of a whale.

01:08:48.345 --> 01:08:50.966
Why, he swallows
whole ships alive.

01:08:51.298 --> 01:08:54.432
Tie it good and tight now.
And besides, it's dangerous.

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:56.469
- Why, I...
- Bye, Jiminy.

01:08:56.604 --> 01:09:00.435
Goodbye? I may be live bait
down there, but I'm with ya.

01:09:00.631 --> 01:09:03.682
Come on, let's go.

01:09:04.145 --> 01:09:07.027
Look out below!

01:09:14.839 --> 01:09:17.841
Gangway, down there.

01:09:25.424 --> 01:09:29.225
Gee, what a big place.

01:09:40.890 --> 01:09:43.228
- Come on, Jiminy.
- All right.

01:09:43.411 --> 01:09:45.932
Soon as I take on some ballast.

01:09:46.234 --> 01:09:48.541
One side, sister.

01:09:53.185 --> 01:09:55.640
Well, so long.

01:10:00.084 --> 01:10:02.805
Hmm, put it in the wrong end.

01:10:08.468 --> 01:10:12.382
Hmph, no more privacy
than a goldfish.

01:10:12.513 --> 01:10:14.885
Ooh, chilly.

01:10:19.203 --> 01:10:21.310
Father!

01:10:31.491 --> 01:10:33.549
Father!

01:10:39.724 --> 01:10:42.940
Hey, Pinoke, wait for me!

01:10:43.269 --> 01:10:45.227
Father!

01:10:45.463 --> 01:10:49.707
Father! Huh, he ain't my father.

01:10:50.274 --> 01:10:52.443
Mr Geppetto!

01:10:53.596 --> 01:10:56.301
Hey, what the...

01:10:56.732 --> 01:10:58.591
Hey, le... let go!

01:10:58.766 --> 01:11:01.601
Run along, ya little... squirt.

01:11:01.887 --> 01:11:04.558
What's the matter? Can't
a fellow, uh... I was only...

01:11:06.042 --> 01:11:08.646
We were only looking
for Monstro.

01:11:10.379 --> 01:11:12.901
That got 'em.

01:11:13.032 --> 01:11:15.038
Father!

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:26.232
Father!

01:11:28.431 --> 01:11:30.637
Oh, hello.

01:11:33.719 --> 01:11:35.961
Oh! Uh...

01:11:36.247 --> 01:11:40.258
...can you tell me where
we can find Monstro?

01:11:40.534 --> 01:11:43.817
Gee, they're scared.

01:11:47.366 --> 01:11:49.739
Uh, pardon me, pearl...

01:11:51.621 --> 01:11:54.691
...are you acquainted
with Monstro the whale?

01:12:01.122 --> 01:12:03.529
Whoa, hold it there.

01:12:12.632 --> 01:12:14.667
Father!

01:12:17.905 --> 01:12:19.845
One side there, son.

01:12:19.974 --> 01:12:23.010
Come on, boys, break it up.
Break it up now.

01:12:26.856 --> 01:12:29.062
Hey, what the...

01:12:29.292 --> 01:12:31.018
Whoa, quit, quit,
quit shoving now.

01:12:31.152 --> 01:12:34.735
Quit, whoa. Don't crowd.
Now take it easy. Take it easy there.

01:12:42.455 --> 01:12:45.028
Whoa-ho-ho there. Whoa!

01:12:45.166 --> 01:12:48.782
Steady there, Nellie.
Go ahead, Pinoke, ask them.

01:12:49.909 --> 01:12:53.029
Could any of you tell me
where to find Monstro?

01:12:53.132 --> 01:12:56.169
Whoa! Whoa, boy!
Whoa, whoa! Hey!

01:12:58.613 --> 01:13:00.589
Uh, sakes alive.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.706
Father!

01:13:06.185 --> 01:13:09.969
- Father!
- Mr Geppetto!

01:13:50.648 --> 01:13:53.899
Not a bite for days.

01:13:59.407 --> 01:14:03.007
We can't hold out much longer.

01:14:11.412 --> 01:14:13.556
I never thought...

01:14:13.829 --> 01:14:17.461
...it would end this way, Figaro.

01:14:18.613 --> 01:14:21.663
Starving to death...

01:14:21.971 --> 01:14:25.121
...in the belly of a whale.

01:14:25.349 --> 01:14:29.064
My poor little Pinocchio.

01:14:30.521 --> 01:14:34.122
He was such a good boy.

01:14:34.358 --> 01:14:37.312
It's hopeless, Figaro.

01:14:41.949 --> 01:14:44.886
There isn't a fish left.

01:14:45.019 --> 01:14:47.990
If the monster doesn't
wake up soon, I...

01:14:48.122 --> 01:14:50.211
I'm afraid we...

01:14:50.541 --> 01:14:52.366
We are done for.

01:15:12.647 --> 01:15:14.985
Here they come!

01:15:15.346 --> 01:15:18.300
Tuna! Oh, tuna fish!

01:15:21.656 --> 01:15:25.888
Food! We'll eat!
Here's a big one!

01:15:28.359 --> 01:15:31.426
Keep them in there, Figaro!

01:15:33.084 --> 01:15:36.983
Hey! Wait a minute!
Ha-Have you seen...

01:15:38.884 --> 01:15:40.757
Monstro!

01:15:43.054 --> 01:15:45.759
We got to get out of here!

01:15:52.770 --> 01:15:56.054
Come on, Pinoke.
Don't wait for me.

01:15:57.191 --> 01:15:59.400
Never saw so many!

01:16:08.119 --> 01:16:11.767
Here's another one!
Enough for weeks!

01:16:11.998 --> 01:16:14.071
Here's a big one.

01:16:21.883 --> 01:16:24.171
Keep them in there, Figaro!

01:16:57.835 --> 01:17:01.335
Hey, blubber mouth, open up!
I got to get in there!

01:17:01.689 --> 01:17:04.241
Looks like the last of them.

01:17:08.346 --> 01:17:12.157
Here's a big one.
Only a few left.

01:17:12.683 --> 01:17:15.091
We got to work fast!

01:17:15.228 --> 01:17:17.553
- Hey!
- Here's another one.

01:17:17.688 --> 01:17:19.814
Hey, Father!

01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:23.450
- Father!
- Don't bother me now, Pinocchio!

01:17:24.362 --> 01:17:26.817
- Pinocchio!
- Father!

01:17:27.148 --> 01:17:29.802
Pinocchio, my son!

01:17:30.034 --> 01:17:33.879
- Hey, Father, here I am!
- Huh?

01:17:34.205 --> 01:17:37.656
Oh, oh, yes!
Pinocchio, my boy!

01:17:37.822 --> 01:17:41.866
- I... I'm so happy to see you!
- Me too, Father!

01:17:41.993 --> 01:17:46.073
- Oops!
- Figaro! Ah, Figaro.

01:17:46.315 --> 01:17:48.886
Cleo! Oh, Cleo!

01:17:49.278 --> 01:17:51.752
- You're here too.
- Yes!

01:17:51.915 --> 01:17:55.580
We are all together again!

01:17:55.685 --> 01:17:58.655
- Oh, you, you are soaking wet.
- Yes, Father.

01:17:58.888 --> 01:18:00.627
You, you mustn't catch cold.

01:18:00.757 --> 01:18:04.422
- But I came to save you!
- You shouldn't have come down here.

01:18:04.552 --> 01:18:07.938
- But, Father!
- But I'm awfully glad to see you.

01:18:08.072 --> 01:18:11.306
Let me take your hat. Oh!

01:18:11.634 --> 01:18:14.037
Pinocchio!

01:18:15.271 --> 01:18:17.112
What's the matter?

01:18:17.248 --> 01:18:20.434
- Those ears!
- Huh? Ears?

01:18:20.668 --> 01:18:22.525
Oh, these.

01:18:22.753 --> 01:18:25.026
Hah. Oh, that's nothing.

01:18:25.256 --> 01:18:27.230
I got a tail too.

01:18:30.261 --> 01:18:32.486
Pinocchio!

01:18:32.722 --> 01:18:35.047
What's happened to you?

01:18:35.183 --> 01:18:38.017
Well, I... I... I...

01:18:38.853 --> 01:18:40.859
Oh, never mind now.

01:18:41.019 --> 01:18:43.507
Old Geppetto has his
little Woodenhead.

01:18:43.608 --> 01:18:46.099
Nothing else matters.

01:18:46.835 --> 01:18:49.106
I got to get in!
My pal's in there!

01:18:49.238 --> 01:18:51.480
Come on, you big moose!
Open up, I tell ya...

01:18:51.616 --> 01:18:53.489
Hey! Cut it out!

01:18:56.946 --> 01:18:59.863
Oh, boy.
Beat it, you buzzards!

01:19:01.409 --> 01:19:06.052
Get out? Oh, no, no, son.
I've tried every way.

01:19:06.130 --> 01:19:08.835
Why, I, I even built a raft.

01:19:08.966 --> 01:19:11.837
- A raft? That's it!
- Huh?

01:19:11.969 --> 01:19:14.704
We'll take the raft, and when
the whale opens its mouth...

01:19:14.767 --> 01:19:17.208
No, no, no, no.
N-Now listen, son.

01:19:17.308 --> 01:19:21.092
He only opens his mouth
when he's eating.

01:19:21.229 --> 01:19:23.435
Then everything comes in.

01:19:23.664 --> 01:19:25.338
Nothing goes out.

01:19:25.416 --> 01:19:27.823
- Oh.
- It's hopeless, Pinocchio.

01:19:27.922 --> 01:19:31.706
Come. We make a nice fire
and we cook some of the fish.

01:19:31.923 --> 01:19:35.690
- A fire! That's it!
- Yes. And then we'll all eat again.

01:19:35.827 --> 01:19:38.282
A great big fire!
Lots of smoke.

01:19:38.442 --> 01:19:40.316
Smoke? Oh, yeah, sure.

01:19:40.414 --> 01:19:42.206
A smoked fish will taste good.

01:19:42.333 --> 01:19:45.868
- Quick, some wood.
- Pinocchio, not the chair!

01:19:46.003 --> 01:19:48.329
Hurry, Father. More wood!

01:19:48.464 --> 01:19:50.540
Oh, what will we sit on if we...

01:19:50.675 --> 01:19:53.878
We won't need it.
We're getting out!

01:19:54.011 --> 01:19:56.170
Getting out?
But how?

01:19:56.365 --> 01:20:00.145
- We'll make him sneeze!
- Make him sneeze?

01:20:00.538 --> 01:20:04.549
Ohh, that will make him mad.

01:20:26.005 --> 01:20:28.312
Well, it's about time!

01:20:33.401 --> 01:20:37.281
- It won't work!
- Hurry, Father! Climb aboard!

01:20:37.513 --> 01:20:41.345
- We'll never get by those teeth!
- Yes, we will!

01:20:41.476 --> 01:20:45.343
Hey, which way you going?
Wait for me!

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:48.315
Hang on! Here we go!

01:20:56.524 --> 01:20:58.018
Gesundheit.

01:20:59.744 --> 01:21:04.162
- We're going back!
- No, we'll make it! Faster, faster!

01:21:05.733 --> 01:21:08.407
It's no use!
We're done for!

01:21:16.193 --> 01:21:18.316
We made it!

01:21:24.722 --> 01:21:27.130
Look! Now he is mad!

01:21:32.811 --> 01:21:35.417
I told you he'd be furious!

01:21:45.122 --> 01:21:47.281
- He's gone!
- Where did he go?

01:21:47.416 --> 01:21:49.686
Look out!

01:21:50.211 --> 01:21:52.519
Hang on!

01:22:06.477 --> 01:22:08.815
He's coming back.
Hurry!

01:22:09.147 --> 01:22:11.982
He's trying to kill us!
Paddle, son!

01:22:21.450 --> 01:22:22.993
Let's go back!

01:22:24.945 --> 01:22:27.352
Look out! Jump!

01:22:33.879 --> 01:22:36.414
Father! Father!

01:22:36.691 --> 01:22:38.746
Oh, Father!

01:22:39.177 --> 01:22:42.777
Pinocchio, swim for shore.
Swim for shore.

01:22:45.883 --> 01:22:47.591
Hang on, Father!

01:22:47.685 --> 01:22:50.556
Save... yourself.

01:23:59.206 --> 01:24:00.929
Pinocchio...

01:24:01.259 --> 01:24:03.335
...save yourself.

01:24:04.512 --> 01:24:06.721
Don't mind me, son.

01:24:08.224 --> 01:24:11.872
Save yourself, Pinocchio.

01:24:14.151 --> 01:24:16.377
Pinocchio?

01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:19.693
Oh, Pinocchio!

01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:22.694
Pinocchi...

01:24:34.797 --> 01:24:36.471
My boy.

01:24:40.548 --> 01:24:43.833
My brave little boy.

01:24:52.593 --> 01:24:57.884
<i>Prove yourself brave,
truthful and unselfish...</i>

01:24:58.135 --> 01:25:02.212
<i>...and someday you will be
a real boy.</i>

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:04.841
<i>Awake, Pinocchio.</i>

01:25:05.172 --> 01:25:06.982
<i>Awake.</i>

01:25:12.647 --> 01:25:15.998
Father!
Whatcha crying for?

01:25:16.083 --> 01:25:19.566
'Cause... you are dead,
Pinocchio.

01:25:19.855 --> 01:25:21.599
No! No, I'm not.

01:25:21.672 --> 01:25:25.373
Yes, yes, you are.
Now, lie down.

01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:27.882
But, Father, I'm alive. See?

01:25:28.012 --> 01:25:31.279
And... And I'm, uh...

01:25:32.136 --> 01:25:36.663
I'm... I'm real.
I'm a real boy!

01:25:37.604 --> 01:25:41.300
You're alive!
And, and you are a real boy!

01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:45.066
- Yea! Whoopie!
- A real live boy!

01:25:45.196 --> 01:25:47.948
This calls for a celebration!

01:25:54.372 --> 01:25:57.041
Professor, lots of music!

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:14.594
Well! Huh. Th-This is
practically where I came in.

01:26:31.759 --> 01:26:33.666
Thank you, milady.

01:26:33.836 --> 01:26:36.737
He deserved to be a real boy.

01:26:36.931 --> 01:26:39.286
And it sure was nice of you to...

01:26:39.517 --> 01:26:43.067
Huh? Wha... Uh... Wh... Wh...

01:26:44.064 --> 01:26:45.521
Well, I'll be!

01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:47.781
My, my!

01:26:48.217 --> 01:26:50.126
Solid gold too.

01:26:52.396 --> 01:26:55.367
Oh, I think it's swell!

01:26:59.323 --> 01:27:04.165
<i>When your heart
is in your dream</i>

01:27:04.365 --> 01:27:06.903
<i>No request</i>

01:27:07.064 --> 01:27:12.040
