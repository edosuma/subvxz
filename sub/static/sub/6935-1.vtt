00:25.033 --> 00:39.300
**

00:39.300 --> 00:44.900
**

00:45.633 --> 00:46.667
How many times we gotta fix

00:46.667 --> 00:47.733
This old fence?

00:47.733 --> 00:48.800
Easier to tear it down and start

00:48.800 --> 00:52.267
Over.

00:52.267 --> 00:54.000
[Barking]

00:54.000 --> 00:55.067
Not you again!

00:55.067 --> 00:56.100
Look'it!

00:56.100 --> 01:00.567
Look'it!

01:00.567 --> 01:02.700
It looks like he wet himself.

01:02.700 --> 01:05.266
That's a big old scaredy cat.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.200
You go ahead and laugh.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.233
He can't bite through that brace

01:08.233 --> 01:13.533
On your leg.

01:13.533 --> 01:14.533
Toto!

01:14.533 --> 01:15.100
Toto!

01:15.100 --> 01:16.667
Toto, come back here.

01:16.667 --> 01:17.700
Morning, miss Dorothy.

01:17.700 --> 01:18.400
Robert found your dog for you.

01:18.400 --> 01:19.300
I told you; You can't come

01:19.300 --> 01:20.867
With me.

01:20.867 --> 01:21.967
Somebody takin' a trip?

01:21.967 --> 01:22.667
Or running away from home

01:22.667 --> 01:23.533
Again?

01:23.533 --> 01:24.600
You can't run away from home

01:24.600 --> 01:25.667
If you're not home to start

01:25.667 --> 01:26.700
With.

01:26.700 --> 01:27.767
Don't she live here?

01:27.767 --> 01:29.333
Could'a sworn she lived here.

01:29.333 --> 01:30.400
Dorothy Gail, I am too old to

01:30.400 --> 01:31.433
Be chasin' you down.

01:31.433 --> 01:32.567
I swear I don't know who needs a

01:32.567 --> 01:34.100
Leash more; You or that dog.

01:34.100 --> 01:35.667
Morning, miss em.

01:35.667 --> 01:37.267
And why are you three

01:37.267 --> 01:38.800
Standing 'round?

01:38.800 --> 01:39.900
Can't you see the leaves turning

01:39.900 --> 01:40.567
Over?

01:40.567 --> 01:41.467
Storm's coming.

01:41.467 --> 01:42.567
Can't you see?

01:42.567 --> 01:44.133
We're still cleaning up the

01:44.133 --> 01:45.167
Last.

01:45.167 --> 01:46.233
Go on, get everything back to

01:46.233 --> 01:47.300
The barn.

01:47.300 --> 01:48.333
Lock down the shutters and turn

01:48.333 --> 01:49.367
The horses out.

01:49.367 --> 01:51.067
Yes, ma'am.

01:51.067 --> 01:58.333
And take this dog with you.

01:58.333 --> 01:59.433
So, I guess you won't be helping

01:59.433 --> 02:01.533
Me with the laundry today.

02:01.533 --> 02:02.600
Oh, Dorothy.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.167
I don't know what to do with

02:04.167 --> 02:05.267
You.

02:05.267 --> 02:06.233
You don't gotta do nothing.

02:06.233 --> 02:07.333
Well, that'll make a nice

02:07.333 --> 02:08.067
Break from worrying about you

02:08.067 --> 02:09.467
Day and night.

02:09.467 --> 02:10.067
Why should you worry?

02:10.067 --> 02:14.200
You're not my mother.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.767
No, I'm your mother's big

02:15.767 --> 02:16.833
Sister.

02:16.833 --> 02:18.933
And when you get your face all

02:18.933 --> 02:19.633
Balled up mad like that it's

02:19.633 --> 02:20.700
Almost like having her back with

02:20.700 --> 02:22.067
Me.

02:22.067 --> 02:25.200
You're so like her.

02:25.200 --> 02:28.367
Stubborn, strong, smart and

02:28.367 --> 02:31.533
Beautiful...

02:31.533 --> 02:33.133
I don't belong here.

02:33.133 --> 02:34.667
I hate that school and everyone

02:34.667 --> 02:35.733
In it.

02:35.733 --> 02:37.333
I hate this place.

02:37.333 --> 02:38.933
I wanna go back home where I

02:38.933 --> 02:40.600
Come from.

02:40.600 --> 02:41.567
Sweet girl, if I had the

02:41.567 --> 02:44.233
Magic to put your mama and daddy

02:44.233 --> 02:45.300
Back in that house for you, I'd

02:45.300 --> 02:46.400
Snap my fingers and they'd be

02:46.400 --> 02:47.900
There waitin' supper.

02:47.900 --> 02:48.967
But you know as well as me your

02:48.967 --> 02:50.067
Folks are gone.

02:50.067 --> 02:51.067
Gone, baby.

02:51.067 --> 02:52.100
Lost in that accident.

02:52.100 --> 02:53.200
And all the wishin' in the world

02:53.200 --> 02:54.733
Ain't changing that.

02:54.733 --> 02:55.800
Back there's my home.

02:55.800 --> 02:56.867
Back there's nothing but an

02:56.867 --> 02:58.967
Empty apartment.

02:58.967 --> 03:01.600
And my school and my friends,

03:01.600 --> 03:02.633
And nobody riding me to do

03:02.633 --> 03:04.200
Chores or watching over every

03:04.200 --> 03:05.233
Little thing I do twenty-four

03:05.233 --> 03:06.800
Hours a day.

03:06.800 --> 03:07.967
I remember a time, not so

03:07.967 --> 03:09.467
Long ago, you used to like me

03:09.467 --> 03:12.667
Watchin' over you.

03:12.667 --> 03:14.200
Used to be your favorite aunt.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.233
I remember how you come running

03:15.233 --> 03:16.367
To hide yourself behind my apron

03:16.367 --> 03:18.067
At bath time.

03:18.067 --> 03:18.933
Anything to avoid your mama's

03:18.933 --> 03:20.567
Soap and washcloth.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.433
You think I give you chores to

03:22.433 --> 03:24.200
Be ornery?

03:24.200 --> 03:25.267
Being part of a family

03:25.267 --> 03:26.833
Guarantees you always got love,

03:26.833 --> 03:28.433
But you got responsibility too.

03:28.433 --> 03:30.067
Home is something got to be

03:30.067 --> 03:32.100
Earned.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.167
Storm's not waiting on one

03:33.167 --> 03:33.833
Little girl to come to her

03:33.833 --> 03:34.733
Senses.

03:34.733 --> 03:36.400
Let's go, child.

03:36.400 --> 03:41.567
We need to get to shelter.

03:41.567 --> 03:43.700
Much as I love you, much as I

03:43.700 --> 03:44.767
Think I know what's right, I

03:44.767 --> 03:46.333
Can't lock you up in your room

03:46.333 --> 03:47.900
The rest of your life.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.467
All I can do is pray you'll

03:49.467 --> 03:50.567
Choose the path that will lead

03:50.567 --> 03:53.100
You back to the ones who love

03:53.100 --> 03:54.500
You.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.600
**

04:01.600 --> 04:03.167
* put your arms around me

04:03.167 --> 04:06.867
Child like when you bumped

04:06.867 --> 04:09.500
Your shin then you'll know

04:09.500 --> 04:13.167
I love you now *

04:13.167 --> 04:18.433
* as I loved you then

04:18.433 --> 04:21.567
Though you may be trying

04:21.567 --> 04:23.667
Sometimes and I'll need you

04:23.667 --> 04:26.833
And you're not there *

04:26.833 --> 04:30.067
* I may get mad

04:30.067 --> 04:33.700
And turn you away

04:33.700 --> 04:38.567
But lord knows I still care

04:38.567 --> 04:42.733
But you cannot ask *

04:42.733 --> 04:46.833
* for more than can

04:46.833 --> 04:50.067
Come from me I am different

04:50.067 --> 04:52.633
Than you are and one day

04:52.633 --> 04:57.933
You'll see *

04:57.933 --> 05:00.533
* if I lose my patience

05:00.533 --> 05:03.200
With you and suddenly

05:03.200 --> 05:06.367
Start to scream

05:06.367 --> 05:08.933
It's only because *

05:08.933 --> 05:12.667
* I want you to be

05:12.667 --> 05:16.400
Everything I see in my dreams

05:16.400 --> 05:19.067
And I'd like to know

05:19.067 --> 05:22.700
That it's there *

05:22.700 --> 05:26.900
* the feeling we once had

05:26.900 --> 05:29.533
When you know that you can

05:29.533 --> 05:31.667
You can come to me

05:31.667 --> 05:33.233
Whenever you're *

05:33.233 --> 05:36.367
* feeling bad

05:36.367 --> 05:38.467
Don't lose the feeling

05:38.467 --> 05:40.067
We once had

05:40.067 --> 05:41.667
Don't lose the feeling *

05:41.667 --> 05:44.833
* we once had

05:44.833 --> 05:46.933
Though you're growing

05:46.933 --> 05:50.100
Older now and

05:50.100 --> 05:55.367
I'm watching you grow *

05:55.367 --> 05:57.467
* and if I make you

05:57.467 --> 06:00.167
Sad sometimes

06:00.167 --> 06:03.267
I see your feelings show

06:03.267 --> 06:06.400
But one day *

06:06.400 --> 06:10.233
* I'll look around

06:10.233 --> 06:14.300
And you will be grown

06:14.300 --> 06:16.967
You'll be out in the world

06:16.967 --> 06:19.100
Such a pretty little girl *

06:19.100 --> 06:20.633
* but you'll be out there

06:20.633 --> 06:23.900
On your own

06:23.900 --> 06:25.400
You'll be on your own

06:25.400 --> 06:26.967
And I'd like to know *

06:26.967 --> 06:30.200
* that it's there

Questions from here on out.

From here on in.

09:37.467 --> 09:40.633
From here on in or out!

09:40.633 --> 09:41.200
This here's a murder

09:41.200 --> 09:42.233
Investigation.

09:42.233 --> 09:43.500
Murder?

09:43.500 --> 09:44.300
Murder!

09:44.300 --> 09:45.067
I don't know anything about

09:45.067 --> 09:45.833
Any murder.

09:45.833 --> 09:46.933
That's what they all say.

09:46.933 --> 09:47.967
Is that there your house?

09:47.967 --> 09:50.067
It's my aunt em's house.

09:50.067 --> 09:52.700
Ask her about these feet!

09:52.700 --> 09:53.767
And are those feet stickin'

09:53.767 --> 09:54.800
Out from under your aunt em's

09:54.800 --> 10:00.533
House?

10:00.533 --> 10:01.000
I don't know.

10:01.000 --> 10:01.900
It appears so.

10:01.900 --> 10:02.967
And is the person attached to

10:02.967 --> 10:03.500
Them feet dead?

10:03.500 --> 10:04.533
How do I know?

10:04.533 --> 10:06.133
I'm no doctor.

10:06.133 --> 10:06.833
There's a house sitting on

10:06.833 --> 10:07.667
Top of her.

10:07.667 --> 10:08.733
You do the math.

10:08.733 --> 10:12.433
Let the witness answer!

10:12.433 --> 10:13.533
I don't know.

10:13.533 --> 10:14.500
It appears so.

10:14.500 --> 10:15.600
And there you have it...

10:15.600 --> 10:16.633
A murder victim, a murder weapon

10:16.633 --> 10:18.200
And a murder suspect.

Congratulations!

10:34.500 --> 10:35.533

Could you please tell me

11:18.767 --> 11:20.333

11:20.333 --> 11:21.400
Lost, are you? I know what

11:21.400 --> 11:22.467
That's like.

11:22.467 --> 11:23.500
Sometimes I nod out on the bus

11:23.500 --> 11:24.500
And end up in all sorts of

11:24.500 --> 11:25.600
Unfamiliar places.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.600
But let's see if I can help you

11:26.600 --> 11:28.233
Out.

11:28.233 --> 11:29.767
That there is a munchkin.

11:29.767 --> 11:31.367
And that there is a munchkin.

11:31.367 --> 11:32.400
And that there is a munchkin.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.500
So I'd say it's a pretty good

11:33.500 --> 11:35.567
Bet that you're in munchkinland,

11:35.567 --> 11:36.633
In the good ole U.S. of oz.

11:36.633 --> 11:39.800
Am I right?

Yeah!

11:46.633 --> 11:48.200
That's it!

11:48.200 --> 11:49.267
That's the thing almost knocked

11:49.267 --> 11:50.867
Me out the sky!

11:50.867 --> 11:52.967
But lookie here.

11:52.967 --> 11:54.500

11:54.500 --> 11:57.167
It couldn't be.

11:57.167 --> 11:59.800
Oh, no, not my sister!

11:59.800 --> 12:01.367
Please don't tell me somebody

Rotten, evil, older, twisted

12:04.500 --> 12:09.733
Sister evvamean!

Somebody tell me who to thank.

She done it!

12:13.400 --> 12:15.500
Really?

12:15.500 --> 12:16.567
You're awful young to be killing

12:16.567 --> 12:17.600
Witches.

12:17.600 --> 12:18.667
Do you have a license?

12:18.667 --> 12:19.733

12:24.467 --> 12:25.533

Good witch of the South.

12:40.467 --> 12:42.567

12:42.567 --> 12:43.633
You should catch her act while

You're in town.

Girl's got pipes.

My magic slate.

12:51.533 --> 12:52.600
Magic slate?

12:52.600 --> 12:54.733

What can I do for you?

13:39.067 --> 13:40.600
For me?

13:40.600 --> 13:41.667
You freed the munchkins from

13:41.667 --> 13:43.233
The evil rule of evvamean.

13:43.233 --> 13:44.300
The least I can do is take you

13:44.300 --> 13:45.600
Out to lunch.

13:45.600 --> 13:46.933
You like Sushi?

Oh, darling, you can't miss

18:15.267 --> 18:16.867

18:16.867 --> 18:18.967
It's big and it's green and it's

18:18.967 --> 18:21.267
Right at the end of the yellow

18:21.267 --> 18:22.700
Brick road.

18:22.700 --> 18:24.300
The yellow brick road?

18:24.300 --> 18:25.400
Just stay on the yellow brick

18:25.400 --> 18:26.367
Road and you can't miss it.

18:26.367 --> 18:27.433

And the kalidahs.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.667
Who are they?

18:31.667 --> 18:32.700
They're shape shifters.

18:32.700 --> 18:33.767
And mind readers.

18:33.767 --> 18:34.800
And they will charm them

18:34.800 --> 18:35.500
Slippers right off your feet.

And don't forget to warn her

18:36.367 --> 18:37.400
About the poppies.

Poppies?

What I gotta be scared of

18:41.633 --> 18:44.400
Flowers for?

Sometimes the most dangerous

18:45.133 --> 18:45.900
Things are also the most

18:45.900 --> 18:46.900
Beautiful.

18:46.900 --> 18:48.067
That's deep, cuz.

18:48.067 --> 18:49.133
They lure you in, and once

18:49.133 --> 18:50.100
They get their tendrils on you,

18:50.100 --> 18:51.700
They never let you go.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.267
They put you to work feeding and

18:53.267 --> 18:54.300
Watering and plowing their

18:54.300 --> 18:55.367
Fields from sunrise to sunset

18:55.367 --> 18:56.400
Until the first frost sets you

18:56.400 --> 18:57.433
Free.

18:57.433 --> 18:59.600
But it ain't all bad.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.967
You get a lot of fresh air.

19:01.967 --> 19:02.767
Addaperle said something

19:02.767 --> 19:03.833
About the wicked witch of the

19:03.833 --> 19:05.467
West.

19:05.467 --> 19:06.133
Oh, you don't gotta fret

19:06.133 --> 19:06.933
About her.

19:06.933 --> 19:08.300
Seein' how you off'ed her

19:08.300 --> 19:09.067
Sister, if she gets her hands on

19:09.067 --> 19:11.200
You, she'll slice, dice and deep

19:11.200 --> 19:12.233
Fry your butt 'fore you can

19:12.233 --> 19:13.300
Blink.

19:13.300 --> 19:15.367
So, no sense worrying about her.

19:15.367 --> 19:16.433
Have a nice trip.

19:16.433 --> 19:17.500
Regards to the wiz!

19:17.500 --> 19:21.333
Goodbye!

19:21.333 --> 19:22.533
Regards to the wiz!

19:22.533 --> 19:23.600
Just follow the yellow brick

19:23.600 --> 19:24.700
Road?

19:24.700 --> 19:25.767
That's right.

19:25.767 --> 19:26.800
Just follow the yellow brick

19:26.800 --> 19:29.933
Road.

19:29.933 --> 19:31.067
But where is the yellow brick

19:31.067 --> 19:33.600
Road?

19:35.567 --> 19:37.700
**

19:38.900 --> 19:40.900
* there's a feeling here inside

19:40.900 --> 19:41.533
That I cannot hide *

19:41.533 --> 19:43.133
* and I know I've tried

19:43.133 --> 19:48.900
But it's turning me around *

19:48.900 --> 19:51.067
* I'm not sure that I'm aware

19:51.067 --> 19:52.600
If I'm up or down

19:52.600 --> 19:54.667
If I'm here or there *

19:54.667 --> 20:00.067
* I need both feet on the ground

20:00.067 --> 20:02.200
Why do I feel like I'm

20:02.200 --> 20:06.767
Drowning *

20:06.767 --> 20:12.567
* when there is plenty of air?

20:12.567 --> 20:17.300
Why do I feel like frowning? *

20:17.300 --> 20:22.567
* I think the feeling is fear

20:22.567 --> 20:24.133
Here I am in a different place *

20:24.133 --> 20:25.200
* in a different time

20:25.200 --> 20:28.300
In this time and space *

20:28.300 --> 20:33.567
* but I don't want to be here

20:33.567 --> 20:35.700
I was told I must see the wiz *

20:35.700 --> 20:37.300
* but I don't know what a wizard

20:37.300 --> 20:39.933
Is

20:39.933 --> 20:45.733
I just hope the wiz is there *

20:45.733 --> 20:51.600
* maybe I'm just going crazy

20:51.600 --> 20:57.333
Letting myself get uptight *

20:57.333 --> 21:03.633
* I'm acting just like a baby

21:03.633 --> 21:11.600
I'm gonna be all right *

21:11.600 --> 21:18.933
* soon as I get home

21:18.933 --> 21:23.700
Soon as I get home

21:23.700 --> 21:25.267
In a different place

21:25.267 --> 21:28.433
In a different time *

21:28.433 --> 21:32.633
* different people around me

21:32.633 --> 21:37.667
I would like to know *

21:37.667 --> 21:40.133
* of their different world

21:40.133 --> 21:43.833
And how different they find me *

21:43.833 --> 21:44.867
* and just what's a wiz

21:44.867 --> 21:45.900
Is it big?

21:45.900 --> 21:46.967
Will it scare me? *

21:46.967 --> 21:49.567
* if I ask to leave

21:49.567 --> 21:53.767
Will the wiz even hear me? *

21:53.767 --> 21:59.067
* how will I know then

21:59.067 --> 22:04.867
If I'll ever get home again? *

22:04.867 --> 22:08.067
* here I am alone

22:08.067 --> 22:10.167
Though it feels the same *

22:10.167 --> 22:13.833
* I don't know where I'm going

22:13.833 --> 22:15.933
Out here on my own

22:15.933 --> 22:19.633
And it's not a game *

22:19.633 --> 22:23.867
* and a strange wind is blowing

22:23.867 --> 22:26.500
I am so amazed *

22:26.500 --> 22:28.667
* by the things that I see here

22:28.667 --> 22:31.233
I don't want to be afraid *

22:31.233 --> 22:35.067
* I just don't wanna to be here

22:35.067 --> 22:38.133
In my mind, this is clear *

22:38.133 --> 22:44.433
* what am I doing here?

22:44.433 --> 22:47.600
I wish I was

22:47.600 --> 22:58.733
Home **

23:00.567 --> 23:02.667
What d'ya know?

23:02.667 --> 23:05.200
A yellow brick road!

23:07.200 --> 23:16.067
**

23:29.100 --> 23:31.267
Why hello there.

23:31.267 --> 23:31.833
Got any spare change?

23:31.833 --> 23:32.867
Loose bills?

23:32.867 --> 23:33.967
Maybe some dirty old dollars

23:33.967 --> 23:34.967
Cluttering up your purse?

23:34.967 --> 23:36.533
Did you say that?

23:36.533 --> 23:39.533
Did I say what?

23:39.533 --> 23:40.133
A talking scarecrow?

23:40.133 --> 23:40.767
Where?

23:40.767 --> 23:42.333
You!

23:42.333 --> 23:43.400
How come you can talk?

23:43.400 --> 23:45.500
And what you doin' up there?

23:45.500 --> 23:46.567
And if you're a scarecrow, how

23:46.567 --> 23:50.267
Come those crows aren't scared?

23:50.267 --> 23:51.800
A bevy of excellent questions

23:51.800 --> 23:54.500
Which it would be my pleasure to

23:54.500 --> 23:56.067
Answer if only I had a brain.

23:56.067 --> 23:57.100
How can you talk without a

23:57.100 --> 23:58.700
Brain?

23:58.700 --> 23:59.767
I'm not sure.

23:59.767 --> 24:00.767
But since I been hangin' up

24:00.767 --> 24:01.867
Here, I've heard an awful lot of

24:01.867 --> 24:06.767
Brainless people talking and it

24:06.767 --> 24:08.967
Ain't stops them.

24:08.967 --> 24:10.100
So how about helping a brother

24:10.100 --> 24:10.633
Out with some cash?

24:10.633 --> 24:12.267
What's it for?

24:12.267 --> 24:13.067
I'm saving my cents to buy me

24:13.067 --> 24:13.767
Some sense.

24:13.767 --> 24:14.833
How much you got so far?

24:14.833 --> 24:16.367
Nothing.

24:16.367 --> 24:18.067
Whatever I get they take away.

24:18.067 --> 24:19.567
That's rent, my brother.

24:19.567 --> 24:22.167
All legit.

24:22.167 --> 24:23.267
Everything on the up and up.

24:23.267 --> 24:24.333
Poles don't grow on trees, you

24:24.333 --> 24:25.933
Know.

24:25.933 --> 24:26.900
Would you like me to help you

24:26.900 --> 24:27.500
Come down from there?

24:27.500 --> 24:29.067
Why he wanna come down?

24:29.067 --> 24:30.633
My man is living penthouse high.

24:30.633 --> 24:32.233
Don't listen to them.

24:32.233 --> 24:33.300
You've got to think for

24:33.300 --> 24:34.300
Yourself.

24:34.300 --> 24:38.200
I would.

24:38.200 --> 24:39.933
As soon as I get me a brain.

24:39.933 --> 24:40.967
But the farmer who made me

24:40.967 --> 24:42.067
Stuffed my head with straw.

24:42.067 --> 24:42.700
Then these crows come along

24:42.700 --> 24:43.600
Filling it with all manner of

24:43.600 --> 24:44.667
Nonsense.

24:44.667 --> 24:45.767
Ever hear such ingrateful

24:45.767 --> 24:46.767
Platitudes?

24:46.767 --> 24:47.867
We fill his head with the

24:47.867 --> 24:49.633
Truth.

24:49.633 --> 24:50.967
The whole truth and nothing but

24:50.967 --> 24:52.067
The truth.

24:52.067 --> 24:53.100
What kind of truth?

24:53.100 --> 24:54.133
Go on.

24:54.133 --> 24:56.733
Elucidate the sister.

24:56.733 --> 24:57.800
"There ain't no gettin' ahead"

24:57.800 --> 25:00.067
"For folks like me."

25:00.067 --> 25:01.067
Gettin' a head!

25:01.067 --> 25:03.100
That's funny, right?

25:03.100 --> 25:05.767
Sit down, girl.

25:05.767 --> 25:09.767
School is in session.

25:09.767 --> 25:10.067
Go on.

25:10.067 --> 25:10.767
Tell her what else we taught

25:10.767 --> 25:11.533
You.

25:11.533 --> 25:14.800
Represent.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.067
I don't want to.

25:16.067 --> 25:17.100
Yeah!

25:17.100 --> 25:18.133
Crow-cede with the crow

25:18.133 --> 25:19.100
Commandments.

Shoo!

All of you.

You think you scare us?

28:52.700 --> 28:54.700
You listen up, I already

28:54.700 --> 28:55.367
Killed a wicked witch this

Morning and I wasn't even mad at

28:56.400 --> 29:01.100
Her.

29:01.100 --> 29:03.833
Gotta fly.

29:03.833 --> 29:08.133
Catch you on the b-side.

You can come down now.

Do I look all right?

29:19.933 --> 29:20.933
Seem a little wobbly.

29:20.933 --> 29:22.067
For me, that's all right.

See the wiz.

29:28.133 --> 29:28.833

29:28.833 --> 29:30.067
He lives in the emerald city

29:30.067 --> 29:31.467
And there's nothing he can't do.

29:31.467 --> 29:33.067
He's gonna get me home.

29:33.067 --> 29:34.100
And I bet he can get you some

31:20.800 --> 31:22.933
You hear that?

31:22.933 --> 31:24.067
It's coming from over there.

31:24.067 --> 31:25.067
What should we do?

31:25.067 --> 31:26.100
Go over there!

31:26.100 --> 31:27.167
Ohhhhhhhh!

31:27.167 --> 31:30.333
Someone's in trouble.

31:30.333 --> 31:32.467
What is it?

31:32.467 --> 31:33.500
I have seen me some

31:33.500 --> 31:34.567
Dope-fresh crock-pots in my day,

31:34.567 --> 31:35.600
But...

31:35.600 --> 31:36.633
Shh, he's trying to say

31:36.633 --> 31:37.700
Something.

31:37.700 --> 31:39.300
Oil.

31:39.300 --> 31:41.900
What was that?

31:41.900 --> 31:42.967
Oil.

31:42.967 --> 31:44.700
I need oil.

31:44.700 --> 31:45.300
He said he needs oil.

31:45.300 --> 31:56.133
Could this be it?

31:56.133 --> 31:59.067
And now what?

32:02.533 --> 32:04.633

34:21.967 --> 34:23.067
How do I ever thank you?

34:23.067 --> 34:24.567
Start by saying goodbye.

34:24.567 --> 34:26.199
C'mon, Dorothy.

34:26.199 --> 34:27.233
How did you get all rusted up

34:27.233 --> 34:28.800
Like that?

34:28.800 --> 34:35.167
Would you mind?

34:35.167 --> 34:37.800
I was out here fixing and

34:37.800 --> 34:39.900
Tinkering and whatnot when the

34:39.900 --> 34:41.500
Strangest storm come out of

34:41.500 --> 34:43.100
Nowhere and before I could duck

34:43.100 --> 34:44.132
For cover, I was rusted solid.

34:44.132 --> 34:45.433
That's terrible.

34:45.433 --> 34:47.632
That's life.

34:47.632 --> 34:48.900
Let's go.

34:48.900 --> 34:50.199
I've gotta say, I've never

34:50.199 --> 34:51.067
Met a man made out of tin

34:51.067 --> 34:52.067
Before.

34:52.067 --> 34:53.100
And you never seen a talkin'

34:53.100 --> 34:54.167
Scarecrow neither.

34:54.167 --> 34:57.633
Just one of them days.

34:57.633 --> 34:58.833
Can we go now?

34:58.833 --> 35:00.400
What's the hurry, son?

35:00.400 --> 35:01.433
We got a date with the wiz.

35:01.433 --> 35:02.533
He's gonna give me a brain and

35:02.533 --> 35:03.567
Send Dorothy back home.

35:03.567 --> 35:04.600
He can do that?

35:04.600 --> 35:06.167
He can do anything.

35:06.167 --> 35:08.300
He's the wiz.

35:08.300 --> 35:13.533
I wonder...

35:13.533 --> 35:16.067
No, he'd never...

35:16.067 --> 35:17.700
What?

35:17.700 --> 35:18.767
Y'know, I wasn't always made

35:18.767 --> 35:19.833
Of tin.

35:19.833 --> 35:20.567
Was a time I was flesh and blood

35:20.567 --> 35:21.400
Just like you.

35:21.400 --> 35:22.967
I was even in love.

35:22.967 --> 35:24.067
Her name was Bertha.

35:24.067 --> 35:25.100
Bertha?

35:25.100 --> 35:26.667
Shh!

35:26.667 --> 35:29.300
Go on.

35:29.300 --> 35:30.367
Problem was there was this

35:30.367 --> 35:31.433
Other girl.

35:31.433 --> 35:33.067
Well, not so much a girl as a

35:33.067 --> 35:34.600
Witch.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.733
Which witch?

35:36.733 --> 35:37.800
Evvamean, the wicked witch of

35:37.800 --> 35:38.833
The east.

35:38.833 --> 35:39.900
You know her?

35:39.900 --> 35:40.600
You could say we run into

35:40.600 --> 35:42.533
Each other.

35:42.533 --> 35:45.167
So, what happened?

35:45.167 --> 35:47.267
I swear I never encouraged

35:47.267 --> 35:48.333
Her but evvamean was sweet on

35:48.333 --> 35:49.900
Me.

35:49.900 --> 35:50.967
Made no never mind, my heart

35:50.967 --> 35:53.067
Belonged to Bertha.

35:53.067 --> 35:55.233
I know I should've manned up and

35:55.233 --> 35:56.767
Told her, but before I could,

35:56.767 --> 35:57.833
Old evvamean caught us kissing

35:57.833 --> 36:00.533
In the woods.

36:00.533 --> 36:01.533
She let loose a bolt of

36:01.533 --> 36:02.600
Lightning knocked me clear

36:02.600 --> 36:04.200
Across the river.

36:04.200 --> 36:07.867
When I opened my eyes I was like

36:07.867 --> 36:15.067
This, ice cold and steely hard.

36:15.067 --> 36:16.767
Bertha said she didn't mind, but

36:16.767 --> 36:17.833
Turning me to tin wasn't the

36:17.833 --> 36:20.967
Worst thing evvamean done to me.

36:20.967 --> 36:22.600
She said if she couldn't have my

36:22.600 --> 36:25.233
Heart, then no one could.

36:25.233 --> 36:27.900
Without a heart I had to let

36:27.900 --> 36:29.967
Bertha go.

36:29.967 --> 36:31.067
That is the saddest story I

36:31.067 --> 36:33.133
Ever heard.

36:33.133 --> 36:34.733
Come on, Dorothy.

36:34.733 --> 36:36.300
See you later.

36:36.300 --> 36:37.067
You don't suppose the wiz...

36:37.067 --> 36:38.433
Well, of course he can give

36:38.433 --> 36:39.733
You back your heart.

36:39.733 --> 36:41.567
You really think so?

36:41.567 --> 36:43.167
I don't.

36:43.167 --> 36:44.233
But then again, I don't got a

36:44.233 --> 36:45.233
Brain.

36:45.233 --> 36:46.333
You come with us to emerald

36:46.333 --> 36:47.367
City.

36:47.367 --> 36:48.433
When the wiz hears your story he

36:48.433 --> 36:51.600
Will never turn you away.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.867
No.

36:54.867 --> 36:55.400
I can't go with you.

36:55.400 --> 36:56.333
Old evvamean still keeps watch

36:56.333 --> 36:57.433
To be sure I'm never happy.

36:57.433 --> 36:58.967
They don't call her ever-mean

36:58.967 --> 37:01.100
For nothing.

37:01.100 --> 37:01.833
Traveling with me would put you

37:01.833 --> 37:03.200
Both in danger.

37:03.200 --> 37:05.167
But thank you.

37:05.167 --> 37:06.900
Thank you kindly.

37:06.900 --> 37:07.933
Actually, I guess you been

37:07.933 --> 37:09.067
Rusted up so you haven't heard.

37:09.067 --> 37:10.100
Evvamean is no longer of this

37:10.100 --> 37:15.133
World.

37:15.133 --> 37:15.733
See,

37:15.733 --> 37:17.267
What had had happened was

37:17.267 --> 37:21.867
Somebody sort of accidentally

37:21.867 --> 37:23.467
Dropped a house on her.

37:23.467 --> 37:29.300
Come again, say what now?

37:29.300 --> 37:32.133
Those are evvamean's shoes.

37:32.133 --> 37:33.133
It was you?

37:33.133 --> 37:34.233
You dropped a house on evvamean?

37:34.233 --> 37:35.300
I wasn't aiming or nothing.

37:35.300 --> 37:36.333
But, yeah, it was my house.

37:36.333 --> 37:40.067
Thank you.

37:40.067 --> 37:41.367
So how's about coming with

37:41.367 --> 37:42.133
Us?

37:42.133 --> 37:44.233
You mean it?

37:44.233 --> 37:45.867
Could my nightmare finally be

37:45.867 --> 37:46.900
Over?

37:46.900 --> 37:48.467
Why not?

37:48.467 --> 37:52.700
Just show me the way!

You'll detour to the right *

39:26.700 --> 39:30.867
* 'cause I'm a mean ole lion

39:30.867 --> 39:32.467
All you strangers better beware

39:32.467 --> 39:34.567
This is the

39:34.567 --> 39:38.767
King of the jungle here *

39:38.767 --> 39:39.833
* and if I happen

39:39.833 --> 39:41.967
To let you slide

39:41.967 --> 39:43.533
Don't just stand there

39:43.533 --> 39:46.167
Run and hide *

39:46.167 --> 39:47.467
* now, you just caught

39:47.467 --> 39:49.333
My better side *

39:49.333 --> 39:53.067
* 'cause I'm a mean ole lion

39:53.067 --> 39:56.200
I'm a mean ole lion

39:56.200 --> 39:59.733
A mean ole lion *

40:01.667 --> 40:02.000
Ow.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.033
You hit me.

40:03.033 --> 40:04.633
You dig that?

40:04.633 --> 40:06.533
Don't you know you could do

40:06.533 --> 40:07.800
Permanent damage that way?

40:07.800 --> 40:08.867
And you call yourself king of

40:08.867 --> 40:09.900
The jungle?

40:09.900 --> 40:10.933
You see another cat begging

40:10.933 --> 40:11.933
For the gig?

40:11.933 --> 40:13.700
Man, you've got a yellow

40:13.700 --> 40:14.233
Streak a mile wide.

40:14.233 --> 40:16.200
Do not.

40:16.200 --> 40:17.967
I had it touched up last

40:17.967 --> 40:19.933
Thursday.

40:19.933 --> 40:20.633
You ought'a be ashamed of

40:20.633 --> 40:21.367
Yourself, going around roaring

40:21.367 --> 40:21.733
At folks.

40:21.733 --> 40:23.067
You're nothing but a great big

40:23.067 --> 40:24.100
Coward.

40:24.100 --> 40:25.167
Hey.

40:25.167 --> 40:26.200
You don't gotta scream it for

40:26.200 --> 40:27.800
The whole neighborhood.

40:27.800 --> 40:28.867
I've got to represent here, you

40:28.867 --> 40:29.900
Know?

40:29.900 --> 40:30.967
Don't want all the little forest

40:30.967 --> 40:32.033
Creatures getting wise and

40:32.033 --> 40:33.100
Ganging up on me.

40:33.100 --> 40:35.200
Oh, what's the use?

40:35.200 --> 40:36.267
I'll never be nothing but a big

40:36.267 --> 40:40.267
Ole scaredy-cat.

40:40.267 --> 40:42.800
That's all I'm ever going to be.

40:42.800 --> 40:43.867
I tried to get help from this

40:43.867 --> 40:44.933
Old owl.

40:44.933 --> 40:45.967
But he just makes me lie on his

40:45.967 --> 40:47.033
Couch while he asks a lot of

40:47.033 --> 40:48.167
Stupid questions...

40:48.167 --> 40:49.100
How do you feel?

40:49.100 --> 40:49.633
What do you want?

40:49.633 --> 40:50.667
What do you think it means?

40:50.667 --> 40:52.267
I told him, "I think it means"

40:52.267 --> 40:53.333
That I'm getting ripped off,

40:53.333 --> 40:54.367
'Cause you take all my money and

40:54.367 --> 40:55.433
"Give me nothing."

40:55.433 --> 40:56.500
Oh, you poor thing.

40:56.500 --> 40:57.033
Oh, great.

40:57.033 --> 40:58.067
Now I've got little girls

40:58.067 --> 40:59.667
Pitying me.

40:59.667 --> 41:01.767
It could be worse.

41:01.767 --> 41:03.067
At least this forest is a nice

41:03.067 --> 41:05.467
Home.

41:05.467 --> 41:06.533
And you've still got your

41:06.533 --> 41:07.567
Heart.

41:07.567 --> 41:08.633
And a brain.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.233
What good's all that if I

41:10.233 --> 41:11.300
Ain't got the courage to get out

41:11.300 --> 41:14.967
Of bed?

41:14.967 --> 41:16.533
Maybe, just maybe, if you

41:16.533 --> 41:17.600
Came with us to see the wiz, he

41:17.600 --> 41:18.700
Might be able to give you

41:18.700 --> 41:19.767
Courage.

41:19.767 --> 41:20.767
Really?

41:20.767 --> 41:22.400
Just like that?

41:22.400 --> 41:23.600
I don't see why not.

41:23.600 --> 41:24.333
He's going to give scarecrow a

41:24.333 --> 41:25.533
Brain, and tinman a heart and

41:25.533 --> 41:30.300
Get me home.

41:30.300 --> 41:31.933
* come on and ease on down

41:31.933 --> 41:32.933
Ease on down the road

41:32.933 --> 41:34.067
Come on and ease on down

41:34.067 --> 41:38.733
Ease on down the road *

41:38.733 --> 41:42.533
* don't you carry nothing

41:42.533 --> 41:47.067
That might be a load

41:47.067 --> 41:48.500
Come on and ease on down

41:48.500 --> 41:49.567
Ease on down the road *

41:49.567 --> 41:50.567
* 'cause there may be times

41:50.567 --> 41:52.200
When you wish you wasn't born

41:52.200 --> 41:54.067
And you wake one morning

41:54.067 --> 41:57.400
Just to find your courage gone *

41:57.400 --> 41:58.133
* but just know that feeling

41:58.133 --> 42:00.100
Only last a little while

42:00.100 --> 42:01.200
You just stick with me

42:01.200 --> 42:02.767
And I 'll show you how to

42:02.767 --> 42:03.833
Smile *

42:03.833 --> 42:07.533
* come on, ease on down

42:07.533 --> 42:11.633
Ease on down the road

42:11.633 --> 42:12.767
Come on and ease on down

42:12.767 --> 42:14.633
Ease on down the road *

42:14.633 --> 42:15.400
* don't you carry nothing

42:15.400 --> 42:16.433
That might be a load

42:16.433 --> 42:17.500
Come on and *

42:17.500 --> 42:18.833
* ease on down, ease on down

42:18.833 --> 42:20.667
Ease on down, ease on down

42:20.667 --> 42:22.233
Ease on down, ease on down *

42:22.233 --> 42:23.833
* ease on down, ease on down

42:23.833 --> 42:25.433
Ease on down, ease on down

42:25.433 --> 42:28.200
The road *

42:39.900 --> 42:42.567
* where'd the road go?

42:42.567 --> 42:44.200
Come on and, ease on down

42:44.200 --> 42:46.767
Ease on down the road *

42:46.767 --> 42:48.400
* come on and, ease on down

42:48.400 --> 42:49.300
Ease on down the road *

42:50.533 --> 42:51.567
Where'd the road go?

42:51.567 --> 42:52.633
Where'd the what what?

42:52.633 --> 42:53.667
Anybody seen the yellow brick

42:53.667 --> 42:54.767
Road?

42:54.767 --> 42:55.733
We were just on it.

42:55.733 --> 42:56.833
And now we're not.

42:56.833 --> 42:57.867
It's gotta be here.

42:57.867 --> 42:58.933
Roads don't get up and walk

42:58.933 --> 43:00.067
Away.

43:00.067 --> 43:01.067
Maybe not where you come

43:01.067 --> 43:02.133
From.

43:02.133 --> 43:03.167
Anybody else notice how dark

43:03.167 --> 43:04.233
It's getting?

43:04.233 --> 43:05.300
What was that?

43:05.300 --> 43:06.333
What was what?

43:06.333 --> 43:07.367
I thought I heard...

43:07.367 --> 43:08.433
Don't get all hysterical now.

43:08.433 --> 43:10.067
I'm not getting hysterical

43:10.067 --> 43:11.100
Now.

43:11.100 --> 43:12.133
But gimme a few minutes?

43:12.133 --> 43:13.700
If we're going to get to the

43:13.700 --> 43:15.400
Emerald city, we've got to find

43:15.400 --> 43:15.833
That road.

43:15.833 --> 43:18.467
How about this?

43:18.467 --> 43:19.167
There's four directions, and

43:19.167 --> 43:19.733
There are four of us.

43:19.733 --> 43:20.367
We'll each go a different

43:20.367 --> 43:21.100
Direction and, between us, we'll

43:21.100 --> 43:22.133
Find the yellow brick road.

43:22.133 --> 43:23.167
Good plan.

43:23.167 --> 43:24.233
Yeah, good plan.

43:24.233 --> 43:25.300
Can I go with you?

43:25.300 --> 43:26.333
Snap to, Leroy!

43:26.333 --> 43:27.933
You're embarrassing yourself.

43:27.933 --> 43:31.967
Now, let's move out!

43:33.733 --> 43:35.833
Dorothy.

43:35.833 --> 43:37.400
Dorothy.

43:37.400 --> 43:40.067
Who's that?

43:40.067 --> 43:41.100
Scarecrow?

43:41.100 --> 43:42.167
Dorothy, help me, baby.

43:42.167 --> 43:43.200
Aunt em?

43:43.200 --> 43:44.300
That you?

43:44.300 --> 43:45.333
It's me, baby.

43:45.333 --> 43:46.933
Don't you recognize your own

43:46.933 --> 43:48.800
Mama?

43:48.800 --> 43:51.433
Mama?

43:51.433 --> 43:52.233
Yes, baby.

43:52.233 --> 43:53.800
It can't be.

43:53.800 --> 43:56.167
You're...

43:56.167 --> 43:59.067
I'm right here, baby.

43:59.067 --> 44:00.633
Mama, I miss you so much.

44:00.633 --> 44:01.700
I've been trying to get home to

44:01.700 --> 44:02.767
You.

44:02.767 --> 44:03.800
And I'm trying to get to you,

44:03.800 --> 44:04.833
Baby.

44:04.833 --> 44:06.967
I wanna hold you so bad.

44:06.967 --> 44:08.567
But I can't get down from here.

44:08.567 --> 44:09.633
I'll climb up and get you.

44:09.633 --> 44:10.667
No!

44:10.667 --> 44:12.233
Stay where you are or you'll be

44:12.233 --> 44:13.300
Stuck here, too.

44:13.300 --> 44:15.967
But how can I get you down?

44:15.967 --> 44:19.367
Those shoes.

44:19.367 --> 44:20.133
Shoes?

44:20.133 --> 44:24.833
Them silver slippers.

44:24.833 --> 44:26.300
They're magic.

44:26.300 --> 44:27.600
They'll get me down.

44:27.600 --> 44:28.733
Pass 'em to me.

44:28.733 --> 44:29.133
But i...

44:29.133 --> 44:30.067
Come on, baby girl.

44:30.067 --> 44:31.900
Don't you wanna see your mama?

44:31.900 --> 44:33.167

44:35.267 --> 44:37.733
Don't matter what you

44:37.733 --> 44:38.333
Promised that old witch.

44:38.333 --> 44:38.933
You listen to your mama.

44:38.933 --> 44:40.533
Hand me them slippers.

44:40.533 --> 44:41.567
Please, baby, please.

44:41.567 --> 44:43.667
Come on, stretch a little bit

44:43.667 --> 44:44.767
More.

44:44.767 --> 44:46.333
Dorothy, no!

44:46.333 --> 44:47.233
It's the kalidahs!

44:52.433 --> 45:03.467
**

45:03.467 --> 45:17.633
**

45:17.633 --> 45:27.733
**

45:27.733 --> 45:33.500
**

45:33.500 --> 45:34.467
**

45:36.200 --> 45:37.767
Thank you, tinman.

45:37.767 --> 45:39.367
If you hadn't come back when you

45:39.367 --> 45:40.933
Did...

45:40.933 --> 45:41.633
I will mollywhop the fool

45:41.633 --> 45:42.533
Tries to step to you!

45:42.533 --> 45:44.133
And scarecrow, you really

45:44.133 --> 45:46.467
Surprised me.

45:46.467 --> 45:47.833
Weren't no big thing.

45:47.833 --> 45:49.933
And you, lion...

45:49.933 --> 45:52.067
Can't wait to hear what she

45:52.067 --> 45:53.633
Got to say to that quivering,

45:53.633 --> 45:55.200
Cowering mess.

45:55.200 --> 45:56.267
Wasn't my fault.

45:56.267 --> 45:57.333
I had a furball.

45:57.333 --> 45:58.900
That's exactly what you

45:58.900 --> 46:00.067
Are... a great big furball.

46:00.067 --> 46:01.533
Stop.

46:01.533 --> 46:02.600
I saw him knock down one of

46:02.600 --> 46:04.967
Those things.

46:04.967 --> 46:05.767
Knock down?

46:05.767 --> 46:06.833
It tripped on his tail.

46:06.833 --> 46:07.867
He could've run away, but he

46:07.867 --> 46:08.933
Didn't.

46:08.933 --> 46:09.967
He stood tall.

46:09.967 --> 46:12.100
'Till he played dead.

46:12.100 --> 46:15.067
He's right.

46:15.067 --> 46:15.800
Y'all should just go on without

46:15.800 --> 46:17.900
Me.

46:17.900 --> 46:19.500
Ain't no wiz powerful enough to

46:19.500 --> 46:26.200
Fix this mess.

46:27.900 --> 46:30.500
* woo woo woo woo

46:30.500 --> 46:35.233
There is a place we'll go

46:35.233 --> 46:41.067
Where there is mostly quiet *

46:41.067 --> 46:46.300
* flowers and butterflies

46:46.300 --> 46:55.267
A rainbow lives beside it

46:55.267 --> 46:59.500
And from a velvet sky

46:59.500 --> 47:06.367
A summer storm *

47:06.367 --> 47:09.500
* you can feel

47:09.500 --> 47:14.233
The coolness in the air

47:14.233 --> 47:24.800
But you're still warm *

47:24.800 --> 47:31.167
* and then a mighty roar

47:31.167 --> 47:39.067
Will start the sky to crying

47:39.067 --> 47:44.333
Not even lightning

47:44.333 --> 47:53.300
Will be frightening my lion *

47:53.300 --> 47:59.100
* and with no fear inside

47:59.100 --> 48:02.767
No need to run

48:02.767 --> 48:05.933
No need to hide *

48:05.933 --> 48:09.633
* you're standing

48:09.633 --> 48:14.900
Strong and tall

48:14.900 --> 48:21.200
You're the bravest of them all

48:21.200 --> 48:25.433
If on courage you must call *

48:25.433 --> 48:29.100
* then keep on trying

48:29.100 --> 48:31.233
And trying

48:31.233 --> 48:35.433
And trying *

48:35.433 --> 48:42.267
* you're a lion

48:42.267 --> 48:52.800
In your own way, be a lion *

48:52.800 --> 48:56.500
* I'm standing strong and tall

48:56.500 --> 49:00.200
I'm the bravest

49:00.200 --> 49:05.967
Of them all

49:05.967 --> 49:11.800
If on courage I must call *

49:11.800 --> 49:16.067
* I'll keep on trying and trying

49:16.067 --> 49:19.133
And trying *

49:19.133 --> 49:23.333
* I'm a lion

49:23.333 --> 49:25.467
In my own way

49:25.467 --> 49:28.067
I'm a lion

49:28.067 --> 49:34.300
Be a lion *

49:37.067 --> 49:38.500
Yes, you are.

49:40.200 --> 49:47.600
**

49:47.600 --> 49:57.600
**

49:57.600 --> 49:59.900
**

50:00.767 --> 50:02.333
Dorothy, look.

50:02.333 --> 50:02.867
Isn't that...

50:02.867 --> 50:03.933
It has to be.

50:03.933 --> 50:05.500
What else could it be

50:05.500 --> 50:06.000
Except...

50:06.000 --> 50:07.100
The emerald city!

50:07.100 --> 50:08.133
I've never seen anything so

50:08.133 --> 50:09.233
Beautiful.

50:09.233 --> 50:10.267
Well, what are we waiting

50:10.267 --> 50:11.800
For?

50:11.800 --> 50:14.367
Let's go!

50:16.067 --> 50:20.800
**

50:20.800 --> 50:22.433
What are these?

50:22.433 --> 50:23.500
Nothing but flowers.

50:23.500 --> 50:25.100
No, they're the poppies I was

50:25.100 --> 50:27.167
Warned about.

50:27.167 --> 50:30.233
What do they want?

50:30.233 --> 50:30.833
I'd say they want us.

50:30.833 --> 50:31.933
Don't let them get hold of

50:31.933 --> 50:32.967
You.

50:32.967 --> 50:34.033
Who's she?

50:34.033 --> 50:35.633
Isn't she beautiful?

50:35.633 --> 50:38.233
No, stay back.

50:38.233 --> 50:39.300
You can't let them touch you.

50:39.300 --> 50:40.367
The munchkins said they're

50:40.367 --> 50:41.433
Dangerous.

50:41.433 --> 50:42.467
Like poison Ivy?

50:42.467 --> 50:44.333
Oh, they are worse than that.

50:44.333 --> 50:45.133
What are they up to?

50:45.133 --> 50:46.167
They're up to no good.

50:46.167 --> 50:47.233
What do you suppose they want

50:47.233 --> 50:48.267
With us?

50:48.267 --> 50:49.333
I know exactly what they

50:49.333 --> 50:50.400
Want, and it ain't happening.

50:50.400 --> 50:51.467
The munchkins said that once

50:51.467 --> 50:52.500
They get a hold of you they

50:52.500 --> 50:53.567
Never let go.

50:53.567 --> 50:54.600
And that's a bad thing?

50:54.600 --> 50:55.667
It's not a good one.

50:55.667 --> 50:57.233
This here's my corner of the

50:57.233 --> 51:00.067
Forest.

51:00.067 --> 51:01.200
Y'all need to

51:01.200 --> 51:02.267
Stand back and let a lion do

51:02.267 --> 51:02.867
What a lion's got to do.

51:02.867 --> 51:03.833
Ladies, would any of you care to

51:03.833 --> 51:05.367
Dance?

51:05.367 --> 51:06.867
No, lion, don't!

51:08.600 --> 51:20.133
**

51:20.133 --> 51:34.100
**

51:34.100 --> 51:45.200
**

51:45.200 --> 51:57.167
**

51:57.167 --> 52:06.800
**

52:06.800 --> 52:07.900
Ladies, thank you for that

52:07.900 --> 52:09.200
Lovely dance.

52:09.200 --> 52:09.900
We must do it again some time.

52:09.900 --> 52:10.533
And booya!

52:10.533 --> 52:11.600
That's my lion.

52:11.600 --> 52:12.633
Give me some paw, my man.

52:12.633 --> 52:14.700
Good job.

52:14.700 --> 52:18.567
And now, I believe we have a

52:18.567 --> 52:20.800
Meeting with the wiz, yes?

52:20.800 --> 52:22.767
**

52:36.767 --> 52:37.867
And we have arrived!

52:37.867 --> 52:41.300
The emerald city.

52:41.300 --> 52:48.067
Ain't this something?

52:48.067 --> 52:48.267
>>

52:48.267 --> 52:49.667
End of the line, dawg!

52:49.667 --> 52:50.400
You can't be pushin' your way to

52:50.400 --> 52:51.233
The front.

52:51.233 --> 52:52.267
Go on.

52:52.267 --> 52:53.333
Get yourself to the end of the

52:53.333 --> 52:54.367
Line!

52:54.367 --> 52:55.533
There's no one else here.

52:55.533 --> 52:56.500
You saying you're too good to

52:56.500 --> 52:57.533
Get in line?

52:57.533 --> 52:58.600
No, but...

52:58.600 --> 52:59.633
What?

52:59.633 --> 53:00.733
You something special, some

53:00.733 --> 53:01.733
Kind'a vip or whatnot?

53:01.733 --> 53:03.467
I'm not tryin'...

53:03.467 --> 53:04.400
And you ain't cuttin' the

53:04.400 --> 53:05.467
Line neither!

53:05.467 --> 53:07.067
Now step to the end of the line!

53:07.067 --> 53:08.100
Hello.

53:08.100 --> 53:09.167
May I help you?

53:09.167 --> 53:10.167
We'd like to go inside,

53:10.167 --> 53:11.800
Please.

53:11.800 --> 53:13.367
Name?

53:13.367 --> 53:14.433
I'm Dorothy, and this is

53:14.433 --> 53:15.167
Tinman, and scarecrow and lion.

53:15.167 --> 53:16.067
Sorry.

53:16.067 --> 53:17.067
Not on the list.

53:17.067 --> 53:18.133
Move along.

53:18.133 --> 53:19.200
But we've got to get inside.

53:19.200 --> 53:21.067
And when did that become my

53:21.067 --> 53:24.500
Problem?

53:24.500 --> 53:25.233
Either your name's on my list or

53:25.233 --> 53:25.600
It's not.

53:25.600 --> 53:28.733
Now adios, amigos.

53:28.733 --> 53:29.933
Excuse me, my brother.

53:29.933 --> 53:30.900
That's a lady you're talking to.

53:30.900 --> 53:31.967
And what are you gonna do

53:31.967 --> 53:33.067
About it?

53:33.067 --> 53:33.700
I was just makin' sure you

53:33.700 --> 53:34.600
Knew she was a lady.

53:34.600 --> 53:36.200
Peace out.

53:36.200 --> 53:37.767
Look here, we've come on very

53:37.767 --> 53:38.833
Important business.

53:38.833 --> 53:39.833
There must be some way for us to

53:39.833 --> 53:41.433
Get inside.

53:41.433 --> 53:43.067
Oh, there's several ways.

53:43.067 --> 53:44.100
Your name could be on the list.

53:44.100 --> 53:45.667
You could be famous.

53:45.667 --> 53:46.733
You could grease my palm with a

53:46.733 --> 53:48.333
Sizable donation to my

53:48.333 --> 53:49.533
Retirement fund...

53:49.533 --> 53:50.967
Or you could be connected, know

53:50.967 --> 53:58.667
Somebody important.

53:58.667 --> 53:59.200
I know addaperle.

53:59.200 --> 53:59.900
Come on, you don't know no

53:59.900 --> 54:00.267
Addaperle.

54:00.267 --> 54:00.867
I most certainly do.

54:00.867 --> 54:02.567
In fact, after I killed the

54:02.567 --> 54:03.633
Wicked witch of the east, she's

54:03.633 --> 54:09.667
The one who gave me these

54:09.667 --> 54:11.867
Magical, enchanted slippers.

54:11.867 --> 54:12.900
Excuse me, but did you just

54:12.900 --> 54:13.933
Say addaperle?

54:13.933 --> 54:15.067
Wicked witch?

54:15.067 --> 54:16.067
And enchanted slippers?

54:16.067 --> 54:18.267
Girl, you hit the trifecta!

54:18.267 --> 54:21.867
Welcome to the emerald city!

54:21.867 --> 54:28.200
**

54:28.200 --> 54:39.267
**

54:39.267 --> 54:52.333
**

54:52.333 --> 55:06.733
**

55:06.733 --> 55:11.067
**

55:11.067 --> 55:12.100
Did you ever imagine anything

55:12.100 --> 55:13.700
Like this?

55:13.700 --> 55:14.733
Excuse me.

55:14.733 --> 55:15.567
Can you tell me where to find

55:15.567 --> 55:16.300
The wiz?

55:16.300 --> 55:17.367
What did you say?

55:17.367 --> 55:18.433
The wiz.

55:18.433 --> 55:19.500
He lives around here, right?

55:19.500 --> 55:21.133
What'd she say?

55:21.133 --> 55:22.133
If I didn't know better, I'd

55:22.133 --> 55:23.200
Say she asked where to find the

55:23.200 --> 55:27.400
Wiz.

55:27.400 --> 55:29.067
Why the shade?

55:29.067 --> 55:30.567
The young lady asked a perfectly

55:30.567 --> 55:51.500
Normal question.

55:51.500 --> 56:00.067
**

56:00.067 --> 56:01.067
I don't know what none of

56:01.067 --> 56:02.133
That means.

56:02.133 --> 56:06.167
Excuse me, brother.

56:06.167 --> 56:08.433
We just came...

56:08.433 --> 56:10.367
We need the wiz.

56:10.367 --> 56:19.500
Oh, my.

56:20.267 --> 56:25.100
**

56:25.100 --> 56:26.133
T'ain't nothin' normal about

56:26.133 --> 56:26.733
Wantin' to see the wiz.

56:26.733 --> 56:27.733
Nobody sees the wiz.

56:27.733 --> 56:28.267
Not nobody.

56:28.267 --> 56:29.733
They say he's terrible to

56:29.733 --> 56:30.800
Behold.

56:30.800 --> 56:31.467
He's got the head of a

56:31.467 --> 56:32.067
Fire-breathing dragon.

56:32.067 --> 56:33.067
And the overpowering body of

56:33.067 --> 56:33.533
An elephant.

56:33.533 --> 56:34.633
With wings!

56:34.633 --> 56:35.667
And razor sharp claws that

56:35.667 --> 56:36.733
Can shred a man like tissue

56:36.733 --> 56:37.233
Paper!

56:37.233 --> 56:38.800
I'd hate to imagine what

56:38.800 --> 56:39.867
They'd do to a little girl.

56:39.867 --> 56:40.933
Heard enough.

56:40.933 --> 56:43.067
Who wants to catch a movie

56:43.067 --> 56:44.100
Before we split town?

56:44.100 --> 56:44.833
I hope they don't put butter on

56:44.833 --> 56:45.667
Their popcorn.

56:45.667 --> 56:49.400
I've gotta watch my cholesterol.

56:49.400 --> 56:50.433
But you've never seen him

56:50.433 --> 56:51.500
Yourself?

56:51.500 --> 56:52.067
Nobody has.

56:52.067 --> 56:53.067
Not never.

56:53.067 --> 56:54.100
He's been locked inside that

56:54.100 --> 56:54.800
Throne room since he got here.

56:54.800 --> 56:55.700
Believe me, miss, you don't

56:55.700 --> 56:57.267
Want to go in there.

56:57.267 --> 56:59.400
But we've traveled such a...

56:59.400 --> 57:00.433
You don't want to go in

57:00.433 --> 57:03.633
There!

57:03.633 --> 57:05.167
But unless we see him we...

57:05.167 --> 57:06.233
You don't want to go in

57:06.233 --> 57:09.567
There!

57:09.567 --> 57:11.067
Yes, we do!

57:11.067 --> 57:16.833
Don't we?

57:16.833 --> 57:18.600
We don't want to go in there.

57:18.600 --> 57:19.633
See that right there?

57:19.633 --> 57:20.700
It's a door.

57:20.700 --> 57:22.267
Just a door.

57:22.267 --> 57:23.333
But on the other side of that

57:23.333 --> 57:24.067
Door is everything you've ever

57:24.067 --> 57:24.900
Wanted.

57:24.900 --> 57:25.967
So, are we going through that

57:25.967 --> 57:28.067
Door or not?

57:28.067 --> 57:29.667
[Screams]

57:29.667 --> 57:31.467
Ah!

57:31.467 --> 57:31.867
Look!

57:31.867 --> 57:32.300
Look there!

57:32.300 --> 57:33.700
Are those?

57:33.700 --> 57:34.400
They couldn't be.

57:34.400 --> 57:36.567
Could they?

57:36.567 --> 57:37.300
Pardon, miss, but would you

57:37.300 --> 57:38.067
Mind telling me where you got

57:38.067 --> 57:40.200
Them shiny shoes?

57:40.200 --> 57:43.367
Oh, these old things?

57:43.367 --> 57:45.467
Addaperle laid them on me after

57:45.467 --> 57:47.600
I dropped a house on evvamean.

57:47.600 --> 57:48.633
After you...

57:48.633 --> 57:49.933
My bad.

57:49.933 --> 57:53.433
Go on, miss.

57:53.433 --> 57:55.100
The door ain't locked.

57:55.100 --> 57:56.167
And do give the wiz my best

57:56.167 --> 57:57.200
Regards.

57:57.200 --> 57:59.700
Ooh, snap!

58:16.967 --> 58:18.100
Well, go on.

58:18.100 --> 58:19.167
Why I gotta go on?

58:19.167 --> 58:20.200
You're the only one of us

58:20.200 --> 58:21.267
Wearin' armor.

58:21.267 --> 58:27.067
We'll all go together.

58:27.067 --> 58:28.633
You!

58:28.633 --> 58:29.667
Stop right where you are!

58:29.667 --> 58:32.967
I'm stopped.

58:32.967 --> 58:34.700
I am stopped.

58:34.700 --> 58:36.233
Don't gotta tell me twice.

58:36.233 --> 58:37.333
Who dares disturb my

58:37.333 --> 58:38.333
Meditations?

58:38.333 --> 58:40.567
The man asked a question.

58:40.567 --> 58:42.300
Answer.

58:42.300 --> 58:43.900
I'm sorry if we disturbed

58:43.900 --> 58:44.933
You, but we just want to meet

58:44.933 --> 58:46.533
The wiz.

58:46.533 --> 58:48.767
You want to meet the wiz?

58:48.767 --> 58:50.233
Yes, sir.

58:50.233 --> 58:51.467
If it wouldn't be too much

58:51.467 --> 58:53.633
Trouble.

58:53.633 --> 58:54.700
Child, you don't know what

58:54.700 --> 59:12.900
Trouble is!

59:12.900 --> 59:14.500
* so you wanted to meet? The

59:14.500 --> 59:19.233
Wizard

59:19.233 --> 59:20.833
Let me tell you that you've come

59:20.833 --> 59:21.867
To the right place *

59:21.867 --> 59:22.900
* shall I make you a frog or

59:22.900 --> 59:27.167
Lizard?

59:27.167 --> 59:28.733
You should see the strange

59:28.733 --> 59:30.300
Expression on your face *

59:30.300 --> 59:32.967
* if the way I come on is

59:32.967 --> 59:35.600
Frightening

59:35.600 --> 59:37.167
That's the way I felt like

59:37.167 --> 59:38.233
Coming on today *

59:38.233 --> 59:39.267
* have you ever been kissed by

59:39.267 --> 59:44.067
Lightning?

59:44.067 --> 59:45.633
Let me tell you

59:45.633 --> 59:49.333
That will make you go away *

59:49.333 --> 59:50.333
* I fly, and the magic of my

59:50.333 --> 59:51.933
Power

59:51.933 --> 59:54.067
Takes me higher *

59:54.067 --> 59:55.633
* to a level where the clouds

59:55.633 --> 59:58.300
Turn into fire *

59:58.300 --> 59:59.867
* in the warmness of the fire

59:59.867 --> 01:00:05.667
I feel fine *

01:00:05.667 --> 01:00:07.267
* just keep your eyes open

01:00:07.267 --> 01:00:09.367
And the magic you will see *

01:00:09.367 --> 01:00:10.967
* it will whistle on the wind

01:00:10.967 --> 01:00:13.000
As it emanates from me *

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.100
* it's a strong and true

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:15.667
Vibration

01:00:15.667 --> 01:00:19.900
You can feel it on your skin *

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:20.967
Now come and take my hand

01:00:20.967 --> 01:00:22.567
And we will dance upon the

01:00:22.567 --> 01:00:36.200
Wind *

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.767
* so you wanted to meet the

01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:45.667
Wizard *

01:00:45.667 --> 01:00:48.300
**

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:49.367
Is it over?

01:00:49.367 --> 01:00:51.500
Can I open my eyes?

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:52.533
They are open.

01:00:52.533 --> 01:00:53.600
Oh, no.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.167
I'm blind?

01:00:55.167 --> 01:00:56.233
No.

01:00:56.233 --> 01:00:57.300
The lights are out!

01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:58.867
Silence!

01:00:58.867 --> 01:01:01.533
Who dares disturb my sanctuary?

01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:04.133
Who dares disturb my peace?

01:01:04.133 --> 01:01:06.267
He does!

01:01:06.267 --> 01:01:08.367
Silence!

01:01:08.367 --> 01:01:10.500
Why have you come?

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.567
It was her idea.

01:01:11.567 --> 01:01:12.600
I just wanted to see the world.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.667
Dorothy told me that you

01:01:13.667 --> 01:01:14.700
Could...

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:15.767
Silence!

01:01:15.767 --> 01:01:16.833
Why he ask questions then

01:01:16.833 --> 01:01:17.867
Tells us to shut up?

01:01:17.867 --> 01:01:18.967
One at a time!

01:01:18.967 --> 01:01:20.500
You!

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.067
Lion!

01:01:22.067 --> 01:01:25.767
What do you want?

01:01:25.767 --> 01:01:26.833
To get the hell out of here!

01:01:26.833 --> 01:01:30.067
Tell him.

01:01:30.067 --> 01:01:31.533
Well, sir wiz, sir, I was

01:01:31.533 --> 01:01:34.733
Thinkin', if you happened to

01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:35.800
Have an extra spell you weren't

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:36.867
Using just lyin' around.

01:01:36.867 --> 01:01:37.867
Spit it out!

01:01:37.867 --> 01:01:38.967
Courage!

01:01:38.967 --> 01:01:40.567
I would like some courage,

01:01:40.567 --> 01:01:46.067
Please.

01:01:46.067 --> 01:01:47.300
You tellin' me that the king

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:48.133
Of

01:01:48.133 --> 01:01:49.200
The jungle is a coward?

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.267
Only when I'm awake.

01:01:50.267 --> 01:01:50.767
Or asleep.

01:01:50.767 --> 01:01:52.333
Sometimes I have these dreams...

01:01:52.333 --> 01:01:55.067
Silence!

01:01:55.067 --> 01:01:56.067
And you, straw man.

01:01:56.067 --> 01:01:57.067
You lookin' for courage, too?

01:01:57.067 --> 01:01:57.633
Me?

01:01:57.633 --> 01:01:59.733
Nah.

01:01:59.733 --> 01:02:00.767
I ain't got enough sense to be

01:02:00.767 --> 01:02:01.300
Scared of nothin'.

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:04.467
Is that so?

01:02:04.467 --> 01:02:06.067
Except for fire!

01:02:06.067 --> 01:02:07.100
Fire!

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:07.633
Fire!

01:02:07.633 --> 01:02:08.933
Scared of fire!

01:02:08.933 --> 01:02:13.433
Would you mind?

01:02:13.433 --> 01:02:18.700
Thank you.

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.800
Now, your green-ness, what I

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.367
Would like is a brain.

01:02:22.367 --> 01:02:23.900
What for?

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:24.967
Ain't nobody ever tell you,

01:02:24.967 --> 01:02:26.567
"Ignorance is bliss"?

01:02:26.567 --> 01:02:29.733
Not that I remember.

01:02:29.733 --> 01:02:31.333
And you, little girl.

01:02:31.333 --> 01:02:35.067
What do you want?

01:02:35.067 --> 01:02:38.700
Hello.

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:39.767
My name is Dorothy and I would

01:02:39.767 --> 01:02:40.833
Like to go home.

01:02:40.833 --> 01:02:42.967
So, who's stopping you?

01:02:42.967 --> 01:02:43.967
Well, sir, I don't rightly

01:02:43.967 --> 01:02:46.633
Know how.

01:02:46.633 --> 01:02:47.667
See, I was heading from my aunt

01:02:47.667 --> 01:02:48.733
Em's farm in Kansas to Omaha,

01:02:48.733 --> 01:02:49.800
Where I was born, when this

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:50.867
Storm blew up and...

01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:51.900
Where'd you say you were

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.467
Born?

01:02:53.467 --> 01:02:54.533
Omaha, Nebraska.

01:02:54.533 --> 01:02:55.567
And where's the auntie's

01:02:55.567 --> 01:02:57.167
Farm?

01:02:57.167 --> 01:02:58.233
Kansas.

01:02:58.233 --> 01:03:00.867
So, which one's your home?

01:03:00.867 --> 01:03:01.900
Well, I could've swore I

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:02.967
Knew.

01:03:02.967 --> 01:03:04.067
Well, if you don't know where

01:03:04.067 --> 01:03:05.067
You're goin', how am I expected

01:03:05.067 --> 01:03:06.067
To get you there?

01:03:06.067 --> 01:03:09.800
Step back!

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.933
And you, rin-tin-tin, what are

01:03:11.933 --> 01:03:12.967
You looking for?

01:03:12.967 --> 01:03:16.700
A can opener?

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:20.367
That's very clever.

01:03:20.367 --> 01:03:21.900
You are clever.

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:23.533
Scary as hell, but clever.

01:03:23.533 --> 01:03:24.600
You think I got time to mess

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.200
With fools?

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.300
Tell me what you want, what you

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:29.833
Really, really want!

01:03:29.833 --> 01:03:32.500
A heart.

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.067
A heart, your wizness.

01:03:34.067 --> 01:03:35.133
You tellin' me you're

01:03:35.133 --> 01:03:36.200
Heartless?

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.233
I'm afraid so.

01:03:37.233 --> 01:03:38.833
Then count yourself lucky!

01:03:38.833 --> 01:03:41.467
Think of what you're avoiding,

01:03:41.467 --> 01:03:43.567
Heartburn, heartache, and the

01:03:43.567 --> 01:03:45.700
Occasional heartbreak of

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:48.333
Psoriasis.

01:03:48.333 --> 01:03:49.900
Oh, but sir, think about

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:53.967
Everything else I'm missing.

01:04:02.833 --> 01:04:05.167
* whoa, whoa, whoa

01:04:05.167 --> 01:04:10.400
What would I do

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:15.700
If I could suddenly feel *

01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:21.067
* and know once again

01:04:21.067 --> 01:04:26.267
What I feel is real *

01:04:26.267 --> 01:04:32.600
* I could cry, I could smile

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.733
And I might lay back for a

01:04:34.733 --> 01:04:36.300
While *

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.400
* tell me what

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.533
What would I do *

01:04:40.533 --> 01:04:46.333
* if I could feel

01:04:46.333 --> 01:04:52.667
What would I do *

01:04:52.667 --> 01:04:57.967
* if I could reach inside of me

01:04:57.967 --> 01:05:03.533
And know how it feels

01:05:03.533 --> 01:05:06.433
To say I like what I see *

01:05:06.433 --> 01:05:09.067
* then I'd be more than glad to

01:05:09.067 --> 01:05:12.767
Share

01:05:12.767 --> 01:05:16.967
All that I have inside of here *

01:05:16.967 --> 01:05:19.633
* and the songs my heart might

01:05:19.633 --> 01:05:22.767
Bring

01:05:22.767 --> 01:05:24.333
You'd be more than glad to

01:05:24.333 --> 01:05:29.100
Sing *

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:33.300
* and if a tear came to my eye

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:34.933
Think of all the wounds they

01:05:34.933 --> 01:05:38.100
Mend *

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:41.200
* and just to think

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.933
The time I could spend

01:05:44.933 --> 01:05:48.133
Being vulnerable again *

01:05:48.133 --> 01:05:50.767
* tell me what

01:05:50.767 --> 01:05:53.900
What, what would I do *

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:57.100
* tell me what

01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:58.900
What, what would I do *

01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:01.300
* woah, tell me what

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:03.400
What, what would I do *

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.067
* what I would do, if I could

01:06:06.067 --> 01:06:09.733
Feel

01:06:09.733 --> 01:06:19.167
If I could feel *

01:06:19.167 --> 01:06:26.600
* if I could feel

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:29.100
**

01:06:36.867 --> 01:06:39.567
I, the all powerful wiz, have

01:06:39.567 --> 01:06:40.600
Decided to grant your wishes,

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:43.267
But...

01:06:43.267 --> 01:06:44.333
Hey!

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:45.400
I said but!

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.433
Did you not hear me say "but?"

01:06:46.433 --> 01:06:48.067
There's a but coming.

01:06:48.067 --> 01:06:49.600
There always is.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:50.667
But I want a little something

01:06:50.667 --> 01:06:53.833
In return.

01:06:53.833 --> 01:06:56.467
I will grant all four of your

01:06:56.467 --> 01:06:58.567
Wishes, but first you gotta kill

01:06:58.567 --> 01:07:01.233
The wicked witch of the west.

01:07:01.233 --> 01:07:02.833
Kill the wicked witch?

01:07:02.833 --> 01:07:03.900
Ain't no big thing.

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:04.933
You already wasted her sister.

01:07:04.933 --> 01:07:07.567
How'd he know about that?

01:07:07.567 --> 01:07:10.233
I am the all-seeing,

01:07:10.233 --> 01:07:10.967
All-knowing, all-powerful wizard

01:07:10.967 --> 01:07:12.333
Of oz.

01:07:12.333 --> 01:07:14.433
I know stuff!

01:07:14.433 --> 01:07:16.867
You want what you want?

01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:17.367
No half stepping.

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:19.200
Kill me that witch!

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:24.467
I have spoken!

01:07:24.467 --> 01:07:25.533
Why don't you kill her

01:07:25.533 --> 01:07:26.567
Yourself?

01:07:26.567 --> 01:07:29.233
You don't think I could?

01:07:29.233 --> 01:07:29.967
And I would, except I've got to

01:07:29.967 --> 01:07:30.833
Stay here and protect the

01:07:30.833 --> 01:07:32.467
Emerald city.

01:07:32.467 --> 01:07:32.900
From who?

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:33.967
From the wicked witch of the

01:07:33.967 --> 01:07:35.067
West!

01:07:35.067 --> 01:07:37.133
Are you not paying attention?

01:07:37.133 --> 01:07:38.167
But what's any of that got to

01:07:38.167 --> 01:07:38.733
Do with me?

01:07:38.733 --> 01:07:40.300
What do you mean?

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:42.900
It's all your fault.

01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:43.967
Everything was fine when there

01:07:43.967 --> 01:07:45.567
Was a witch for every corner of

01:07:45.567 --> 01:07:47.667
Oz.

01:07:47.667 --> 01:07:48.733
But then you come along dropping

01:07:48.733 --> 01:07:50.833
Houses where they don't belong

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:51.867
And suddenly there's a whole

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:54.533
Territory up for grabs.

01:07:54.533 --> 01:07:55.567
Right now evillene is plotting a

01:07:55.567 --> 01:07:57.167
Take-over of oz.

01:07:57.167 --> 01:07:58.767
She must be stopped.

01:07:58.767 --> 01:07:59.800
And you're the one needs to do

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:00.867
It.

01:08:00.867 --> 01:08:03.500
Why me?

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:07.200
'Cause I said so, and I am

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:11.400
The all knowing, all powerful

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:19.300
Wiz and I have spoken!

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:20.100
Well, Dorothy.

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:20.867
Good luck.

01:08:20.867 --> 01:08:21.933
We're all counting on you.

01:08:21.933 --> 01:08:23.533
Me?

01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:25.633
The wiz was loud and clear,

01:08:25.633 --> 01:08:29.332
This whole mess is your fault.

01:08:29.332 --> 01:08:29.832
My fault?

01:08:29.832 --> 01:08:30.899
Your tornado.

01:08:30.899 --> 01:08:31.966
Your house.

01:08:31.966 --> 01:08:32.500
Your fault!

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:33.567
You broke it.

01:08:33.567 --> 01:08:34.600
You bought it.

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.167
So, good luck killing that

01:08:36.167 --> 01:08:37.332
Old

01:08:37.332 --> 01:08:38.433
Witch.

01:08:38.433 --> 01:08:39.167
Be sure to let us know when it's

01:08:39.167 --> 01:08:40.067
Done.

01:08:40.067 --> 01:08:41.067
We'll be waitin' in the bar.

01:08:41.067 --> 01:08:41.733
Isn't that just typical?

01:08:41.733 --> 01:08:42.633
All three of you were fine

01:08:42.633 --> 01:08:43.700
Coming along when you thought

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:44.767
You were gettin' something for

01:08:44.767 --> 01:08:45.500
Nothing, but now that there's a

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:46.332
Price to pay you want to wait it

01:08:46.332 --> 01:08:47.399
Out in the bar?

01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:48.966
Cowards!

01:08:48.966 --> 01:08:50.567
You calling me a coward?

01:08:50.567 --> 01:08:51.633
Yes!

01:08:51.633 --> 01:08:56.700
Yes, I'm a coward.

01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:58.399
Hasn't that been established?

01:08:58.399 --> 01:08:59.433
And I'm sorry, Dorothy, but

01:08:59.433 --> 01:09:00.500
You know what my last run-in

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.067
With that witch done to me.

01:09:02.067 --> 01:09:02.800
And I don't know how to help

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.200
You because I don't know how to

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:04.899
Kill a witch because I don't

01:09:04.899 --> 01:09:05.767
Know anything!

01:09:05.767 --> 01:09:06.800
Y'all!

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.867

Y'all are wimping out on me?

01:09:08.933 --> 01:09:10.067
Lion, courage!

01:09:10.067 --> 01:09:11.067
If evillene needs to go, we're

01:09:11.067 --> 01:09:12.633
Sending her out together.

01:09:12.633 --> 01:09:13.567
Says you!

01:09:14.733 --> 01:09:18.433

Dark and lonely

Nothin' but a drop of water.

Nothin' but a drop of...

01:14:43.333 --> 01:14:44.933
Do you know what happens if a

01:14:44.933 --> 01:14:46.067
Drop a water is left to it's own

01:14:46.067 --> 01:14:47.567
Devices?

01:14:54.400 --> 01:15:02.333
Innocent drop of water.

And a killer flood strikes

01:15:03.933 --> 01:15:05.533

Leak from that pipe up there.

01:15:11.333 --> 01:15:12.367

Well, I'm afraid it's bad

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:12.067
News.

01:19:12.067 --> 01:19:14.167
Dorothy and her friends are on

01:19:14.167 --> 01:19:16.833
Their way here to kill you.

01:19:16.833 --> 01:19:18.400
That's not such bad news.

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:19.967
It's not nice news.

01:19:19.967 --> 01:19:22.600
But it's not terrible.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:24.200
I mean, if you're gonna be a

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:25.233
Wicked witch, and you are good

01:19:25.233 --> 01:19:26.833
At your job, you're gonna have

01:19:26.833 --> 01:19:27.567
To expect to rub some folks the

01:19:27.567 --> 01:19:28.933
Wrong way.

01:19:28.933 --> 01:19:31.600
I s'pose.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.700
So, Dorothy thinks she can

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:35.267
March her skinny ass in here and

01:19:35.267 --> 01:19:36.333
Destroy me?

01:19:36.333 --> 01:19:37.400
Well, it ain't my first time

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:39.500
Runnin' the nursery.

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:41.067
I know how to handle a brat like

01:19:41.067 --> 01:19:42.667
That.

01:19:42.667 --> 01:19:44.767
Unleash my winged warriors!

01:19:44.767 --> 01:19:46.367
Not your winged warriors.

01:19:46.367 --> 01:19:47.400
Oh, yes, my winged warriors.

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:52.700
Fly!

01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:58.500
Fly, my warriors!

01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.067
Capture the intruders and bring

01:20:00.067 --> 01:20:01.633
Them back to me.

01:20:01.633 --> 01:20:02.733
Now fly!

01:20:02.733 --> 01:20:04.267
Fly!

01:20:04.267 --> 01:20:05.333
And don't nobody scuff up my

01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:06.267
Sister's shoes!

01:20:34.867 --> 01:20:40.833
**

01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:52.067
You!

Another bucket here.

01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:54.167
And one over there.

01:20:54.167 --> 01:20:54.900
If evillene finds water on the

01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:56.800
Floor...

01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:01.167
Back it up, top cat.

01:21:01.167 --> 01:21:02.900
Are those buckets full?

01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:04.467
If I get that last one will

01:21:04.467 --> 01:21:08.833
That make you happy?

01:21:08.833 --> 01:21:10.400
I think you left a spot.

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:14.333
If I get it, will you be

01:21:14.333 --> 01:21:15.400
Satisfied then?

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:15.833
Satisfied?

01:21:15.833 --> 01:21:18.667
Me?

01:21:18.667 --> 01:21:19.733
Right.

01:21:19.733 --> 01:21:20.767
Dorothy!

01:21:20.767 --> 01:21:21.833
Oh, lion.

01:21:21.833 --> 01:21:22.900
That old witch has me scrubbing

01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:23.967
And polishing.

01:21:23.967 --> 01:21:25.067
I will never complain about any

01:21:25.067 --> 01:21:26.067
Chore aunt em gives me ever

01:21:26.067 --> 01:21:27.633
Again.

01:21:27.633 --> 01:21:30.700
I'm on mop duty.

01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:31.767
That old witch is definitely

01:21:31.767 --> 01:21:35.233
Afraid of water.

01:21:35.233 --> 01:21:36.300
They say she don't even bathe.

01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:37.367
She sends herself out once a

01:21:37.367 --> 01:21:38.433
Week for dry cleaning.

01:21:38.433 --> 01:21:39.100
Excuse me, my lord high

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:40.067
Underling, but did you hear me

01:21:40.067 --> 01:21:41.067
Give anybody a coffee break?

01:21:41.067 --> 01:21:42.133
No, ma'am.

01:21:42.133 --> 01:21:43.200
Not during my lifetime.

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:44.233
Oh, please, Ms. witch.

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:46.867
We haven't seen each other...

01:21:46.867 --> 01:21:47.933
Ask me if I care?

01:21:47.933 --> 01:21:51.100
Back to work!

01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:52.200
No wonder they call you

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.267
Wicked.

01:21:54.267 --> 01:21:54.800
No.

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:55.833
Know what?

01:21:55.833 --> 01:21:56.900
You don't got game enough to be

01:21:56.900 --> 01:22:01.667
Wicked.

01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:05.533
All you are is plain old

01:22:05.533 --> 01:22:08.233
Everyday passable mean.

01:22:08.233 --> 01:22:09.300
Well, if I'm mean... what

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:10.367
Does that make you?

01:22:10.367 --> 01:22:11.433
Don't make me nothing.

01:22:11.433 --> 01:22:12.467
Think not?

01:22:12.467 --> 01:22:13.533
Which one of us dropped a house

01:22:13.533 --> 01:22:14.567
On the other one's sister?

01:22:14.567 --> 01:22:15.633
And which one of us yanked the

01:22:15.633 --> 01:22:16.700
Silver heels right off of that

01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:18.233
Dead sister's not-even-cold-yet

01:22:18.233 --> 01:22:19.933
Feet?

01:22:19.933 --> 01:22:21.500
And which one of us gathered up

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:22.833
A crew to put a hit on the other

01:22:22.833 --> 01:22:24.567
One?

01:22:24.567 --> 01:22:25.633
You're three for three, little

01:22:25.633 --> 01:22:26.700
Girl, so before you go castin'

01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:27.733
Shade, I'd take myself a good

01:22:27.733 --> 01:22:28.800
Look in the mirror.

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:29.400
Now... get back to work.

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:30.400
When are you going to let us

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:30.900
Go?

01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:32.067
When you gonna give me them

01:22:32.067 --> 01:22:33.067
Kicks?

01:22:33.067 --> 01:22:34.100
I promised addaperle...

01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:35.133
"I promised addaperle..."

01:22:35.133 --> 01:22:36.200
This child still thinks I'm

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:38.833
Playin'?

01:22:38.833 --> 01:22:39.933
Lord high underling, send in my

01:22:39.933 --> 01:22:47.800
Dinner!

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:49.400
Tell, oh, lord high, what's on

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:53.067
My menu for tonight?

01:22:53.067 --> 01:22:55.167
Forest lion stew!

01:22:55.167 --> 01:22:56.233
It's a new recipe from

01:22:56.233 --> 01:23:00.067
"Witches wear nightly."

01:23:00.067 --> 01:23:03.100
This old tin can will make a

01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:04.133
Fine stew pot once I pop the top

01:23:04.133 --> 01:23:06.267
Off it.

01:23:06.267 --> 01:23:08.367
And this useless bag of hay will

01:23:08.367 --> 01:23:09.933
Start a good strong fire.

01:23:09.933 --> 01:23:13.633
But first...

01:23:13.633 --> 01:23:15.200
I got me a lion to filet!

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:16.267
Get away from my friends you

01:23:16.267 --> 01:23:22.067
Evil old witch!

01:23:22.067 --> 01:23:25.433
Dorothy, always so brave.

01:23:25.433 --> 01:23:27.300
You want to be a hero?

01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:31.267
You'll be dinner too.

01:23:31.267 --> 01:23:33.500
Oh, no, not water!

01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:34.067
No!

01:23:34.067 --> 01:23:35.100
What have you done?

01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:36.667
You've destroyed me.

01:23:36.667 --> 01:23:37.733
Stupid girl!

01:23:47.233 --> 01:23:49.867
She's dead!

01:23:49.867 --> 01:23:51.967
Oh, lord.

No cutting in front.

01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:40.433
Go to the end of the line.

01:27:40.433 --> 01:27:41.467
Respect, my brother.

01:27:41.467 --> 01:27:43.067
We are back to see the wiz.

01:27:43.067 --> 01:27:45.200
And before you go tellin' us our

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.300
Names are not on the list, allow

01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:49.933
Me to elucidate current events.

01:27:49.933 --> 01:27:51.533
Dorothy just killed the wicked

01:27:51.533 --> 01:27:52.567
Witch of the west.

01:27:52.567 --> 01:27:54.167
For those of you keeping score,

01:27:54.167 --> 01:27:55.233
That's two wicked witches in two

01:27:55.233 --> 01:27:57.833
Days.

01:27:57.833 --> 01:28:00.067
So I dare say there ain't a list

01:28:00.067 --> 01:28:01.067
Anywhere in oz without our names

01:28:01.067 --> 01:28:05.200
On it.

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:06.267
Allow me to apologize.

01:28:06.267 --> 01:28:08.367
You sure are on the list.

01:28:08.367 --> 01:28:09.400
Right here at the top of the

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:10.467
Page.

01:28:10.467 --> 01:28:12.600
"Dorothy, lion, scarecrow and"

01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:14.700
Tinman are hereby and forthwith

01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:15.767
Legally and terminally banned

01:28:15.767 --> 01:28:16.833
From entering the emerald city

01:28:16.833 --> 01:28:18.400
By executive order of the wiz.

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:19.433
No exceptions.

01:28:19.433 --> 01:28:19.967
No excuses.

01:28:19.967 --> 01:28:21.567
"No refunds."

01:28:21.567 --> 01:28:22.633
Banned?

01:28:22.633 --> 01:28:23.700
Banned!

01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:24.733
As in...

01:28:24.733 --> 01:28:25.800
Personae non-gracious.

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:26.533
Now, back up and let the other

01:28:26.533 --> 01:28:28.967
Folks through.

01:28:28.967 --> 01:28:30.533
There are no other folks!

01:28:30.533 --> 01:28:32.667
It's no use.

01:28:32.667 --> 01:28:34.767
We can't get in.

01:28:34.767 --> 01:28:36.367
We'll have to find someplace

01:28:36.367 --> 01:28:38.467
Else to spend the night.

01:28:38.467 --> 01:28:39.533
Yeah.

01:28:39.533 --> 01:28:40.600
I guess you're right.

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.167
But what are we going to do

01:28:42.167 --> 01:28:43.767
With that big bag of gold that

01:28:43.767 --> 01:28:44.800
We got from the wicked witch?

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:46.367
Big bag of gold?

01:28:46.367 --> 01:28:47.967
Oh!

01:28:47.967 --> 01:28:50.600
The big bag of gold!

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:52.733
Yes.

01:28:52.733 --> 01:28:53.767
The big bag of gold is way too

01:28:53.767 --> 01:28:55.367
Heavy to carry around all night.

01:28:55.367 --> 01:28:56.400
That's no problem.

01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:57.467
I dug a hole in the ground

01:28:57.467 --> 01:28:58.533
Around the corner and hid the

01:28:58.533 --> 01:29:01.167
Gold in there.

01:29:01.167 --> 01:29:03.267
Are you sure it will be safe?

01:29:03.267 --> 01:29:04.867
Now who would go lookin' for

01:29:04.867 --> 01:29:06.967
A big bag of gold in a little

01:29:06.967 --> 01:29:09.600
Hole around the corner?

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:11.233
Terrific.

01:29:11.233 --> 01:29:12.800
Let's go find a safe place to

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:13.833
Spend the night.

01:29:13.833 --> 01:29:28.100
After you, my dear.

01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:29.133
Ladies first.

01:29:29.133 --> 01:29:30.200
Scarecrow, you are a genius.

01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:31.800
There's nothing like greed to

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:32.733
Turn a wise man into a fool.

01:29:46.067 --> 01:29:47.633
Mr. wiz?

01:29:47.633 --> 01:29:48.167
Mr. wiz, sir?

01:29:48.167 --> 01:29:49.200
We're back.

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:50.267
I don't think anyone's here.

01:29:50.267 --> 01:29:50.867
He's here all right.

01:29:50.867 --> 01:29:51.833
I can smell him.

01:29:51.833 --> 01:29:52.867
Hello?

01:29:52.867 --> 01:29:53.933
Mr. wiz?

01:29:53.933 --> 01:29:55.533
Huh?

01:29:55.533 --> 01:29:57.633
Um, who goes there?

01:29:57.633 --> 01:29:59.200
It's Dorothy, sir.

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:00.267
We took care of things like you

01:30:00.267 --> 01:30:01.833
Told us.

01:30:01.833 --> 01:30:02.867
The wicked witch of the west is

01:30:02.867 --> 01:30:03.933
Done in.

01:30:03.933 --> 01:30:04.467
Eliminated.

01:30:04.467 --> 01:30:05.533
One might even say

01:30:05.533 --> 01:30:07.100
Liquidated.

01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:09.233
So, what do you want from me?

01:30:09.233 --> 01:30:11.867
Just what you promised.

01:30:11.867 --> 01:30:13.467
I promised nothing.

01:30:13.467 --> 01:30:16.100
Oh, you certainly did.

01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:18.200
Can't say I recall.

01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:27.167
Begone.

01:30:27.167 --> 01:30:28.233
What happened?

01:30:28.233 --> 01:30:32.967
Lion pulled the plug.

01:30:32.967 --> 01:30:35.767
I knew I smelled a rat!

01:30:35.767 --> 01:30:37.433
Is that the the wiz?

01:30:37.433 --> 01:30:38.500
I am the all powerful, all

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:40.100
Knowing, all seeing, all for

01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:50.333
Nothin'...

01:30:50.333 --> 01:30:51.500
All for nothing.

01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:52.567
Hello.

01:30:52.567 --> 01:30:53.100
You don't mean...

01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:54.167
Couldn't be...

01:30:54.167 --> 01:30:55.200
You mean the wiz is...

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:56.267
A fraud!

01:30:56.267 --> 01:30:57.300
And a woman!

01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:58.033
And what's wrong with being a

01:30:58.033 --> 01:30:58.867
Woman?

01:30:58.867 --> 01:31:02.933
Nothing.

01:31:02.933 --> 01:31:04.100
That's right, nothing wrong

01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:06.200
With bein' a woman!

01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:06.867
Don't know where you fools

01:31:06.867 --> 01:31:07.800
Learned your manners.

01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:08.867
But there's everything wrong

01:31:08.867 --> 01:31:09.900
With lying!

01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:13.600
Who you calling a liar?

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:16.233
Oh.

01:31:16.233 --> 01:31:17.633
Right.

01:31:17.633 --> 01:31:19.867
Me.

01:31:19.867 --> 01:31:20.933
I'm nothin' but a huckster from

01:31:20.933 --> 01:31:22.067
Omaha.

01:31:22.067 --> 01:31:23.567
Omaha?

01:31:23.567 --> 01:31:25.133
Howdy, neighbor.

01:31:25.133 --> 01:31:27.767
But how'd you get here?

01:31:27.767 --> 01:31:29.367
Oh, little girl, the places

01:31:29.367 --> 01:31:30.933
You wind up when you don't look

01:31:30.933 --> 01:31:33.600
Where you're going.

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:35.167
Back in Omaha I had me a job as

01:31:35.167 --> 01:31:37.300
A magician's assistant.

01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:39.400
"The amazing Alfred & company."

01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:42.067
I was "and company."

01:31:42.067 --> 01:31:43.067
We'd do magic at night but

01:31:43.067 --> 01:31:44.133
During the day we gave folks

01:31:44.133 --> 01:31:46.233
Rides in a hot air balloon.

01:31:46.233 --> 01:31:47.833
That was the part I liked.

01:31:47.833 --> 01:31:49.400
I loved flying.

01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:50.467
But unfortunately, I hated

01:31:50.467 --> 01:31:57.833
Alfred.

01:31:57.833 --> 01:31:59.433
Well, one day he just pushed me

01:31:59.433 --> 01:32:00.500
Too far.

01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:01.533
I hopped into that hot air

01:32:01.533 --> 01:32:03.100
Balloon and took off for the

01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:05.200
Sky.

01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:06.267
Oh.

01:32:06.267 --> 01:32:07.333
I wasn't planning to

01:32:07.333 --> 01:32:08.400
Disappear.

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:09.967
I just wanted to teach mean old

01:32:09.967 --> 01:32:15.233
Alfred a lesson.

01:32:15.233 --> 01:32:16.833
But out of nowhere came a storm

01:32:16.833 --> 01:32:17.867
With winds and rain so strong it

01:32:17.867 --> 01:32:19.467
Was all I could do to stay in

01:32:19.467 --> 01:32:21.567
That thing.

01:32:21.567 --> 01:32:23.133
I hunkered down and hid my eyes

01:32:23.133 --> 01:32:25.767
For what felt like forever, and

01:32:25.767 --> 01:32:29.967
When I landed, here I was.

01:32:29.967 --> 01:32:31.067
Folks came rushing from every

01:32:31.067 --> 01:32:32.067
Which way to see what had blown

01:32:32.067 --> 01:32:34.700
In on the wind.

01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:36.800
Not wanting to disappoint

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:37.867
Nobody, I quick put on old

01:32:37.867 --> 01:32:39.967
Alfred's black top hat and cape

01:32:39.967 --> 01:32:41.533
And did my best to give the

01:32:41.533 --> 01:32:44.700
Folks a magic show.

01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:47.333
Next thing I knew they slapped

01:32:47.333 --> 01:32:51.067
Fancy threads on me, set me up

01:32:51.067 --> 01:32:53.133
In these digs and proclaimed me

01:32:53.133 --> 01:32:55.233
The all powerful wizard of oz.

01:32:55.233 --> 01:32:56.300
Couldn't you tell someone the

01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:58.433
Truth?

01:32:58.433 --> 01:33:00.067
I tried. But they were so

01:33:00.067 --> 01:33:01.067
Happy to have a wizard they

01:33:01.067 --> 01:33:02.667
Thought could protect them from

01:33:02.667 --> 01:33:04.200
Evillene and evvamean they

01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:08.967
Wouldn't hear it.

01:33:08.967 --> 01:33:11.567
So here I am, all these years

01:33:11.567 --> 01:33:14.233
Later, hiding in the dark lest

01:33:14.233 --> 01:33:15.267
Anyone find out what a nothing I

01:33:15.267 --> 01:33:17.400
Really am.

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:18.967
We been played.

01:33:18.967 --> 01:33:20.067
That's wack, gettin' our

01:33:20.067 --> 01:33:22.633
Hopes up.

01:33:22.633 --> 01:33:23.700
I never thought you'd be

01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:25.300
Brave enough to take on old

01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:26.333
Evillene.

01:33:26.333 --> 01:33:28.467
Well we did.

01:33:28.467 --> 01:33:30.067
Exactly.

01:33:30.067 --> 01:33:32.133
Now listen up.

01:33:32.133 --> 01:33:33.733
You don't need nothin' from me.

01:33:33.733 --> 01:33:37.433
None of you.

01:33:37.433 --> 01:33:40.067
Lion, you say you got no

01:33:40.067 --> 01:33:41.633
Courage, but you were part of

01:33:41.633 --> 01:33:43.200
The team that took out the

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:44.800
Wickedest witch that ever was.

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:46.900
Shakin' the whole time.

01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:48.433
Being scared of scary stuff

01:33:48.433 --> 01:33:50.533
Is smart.

01:33:50.533 --> 01:33:52.700
Respecting danger but still

01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:55.300
Takin' care of business?

01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:58.467
Ace, that's courage!

01:33:58.467 --> 01:34:00.067
What'd'ya know?

01:34:00.067 --> 01:34:03.200
I got courage.

01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:04.267
And scarecrow, you say you

01:34:04.267 --> 01:34:06.933
Got no brain?

01:34:06.933 --> 01:34:08.500
The surest sign that you're

01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:10.067
Talking to a dummy is when he

01:34:10.067 --> 01:34:12.733
Tells you he knows it all.

01:34:12.733 --> 01:34:13.800
It takes a quality mind to know

01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:15.367
That there's always more to

01:34:15.367 --> 01:34:17.467
Learn.

01:34:17.467 --> 01:34:18.533
You, my friend, are of that

01:34:18.533 --> 01:34:20.633
Brainiac persuasion.

01:34:20.633 --> 01:34:22.767
So, knowing that I know

01:34:22.767 --> 01:34:25.933
Nothing proves I know something?

01:34:25.933 --> 01:34:30.667
What do you know?

01:34:30.667 --> 01:34:32.267
And you, tinman.

01:34:32.267 --> 01:34:34.900
No heart?

01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:36.500
You haven't left Dorothy's side

01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:39.133
Since you got here.

01:34:39.133 --> 01:34:41.767
If the way you protect her isn't

01:34:41.767 --> 01:34:42.833
Proof of a good heart, then I

01:34:42.833 --> 01:34:46.500
Don't know what is.

01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:49.167
Oh, I know I have a heart

01:34:49.167 --> 01:34:50.733
Because, just thinking about

01:34:50.733 --> 01:34:52.333
Dorothy leaving, has it

01:34:52.333 --> 01:34:55.500
Breaking.

01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:56.567
Don't start getting all

01:34:56.567 --> 01:35:00.267
Rusted up again.

01:35:00.267 --> 01:35:02.367
Besides, I'm not going anywhere,

01:35:02.367 --> 01:35:06.067
Am I, miss wiz?

01:35:06.067 --> 01:35:07.633
Home is a place.

01:35:07.633 --> 01:35:08.700
No fancy words are going to get

01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:15.833
Me there.

01:35:15.833 --> 01:35:17.567
I'm sorry to say the little

01:35:17.567 --> 01:35:19.133
Sister's right.

01:35:19.133 --> 01:35:20.167
Excuse me, but didn't you say

01:35:20.167 --> 01:35:21.267
You've got a balloon?

01:35:21.267 --> 01:35:23.133
The balloon?

01:35:23.133 --> 01:35:24.300
Surely

01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:25.867
You're not suggesting...

01:35:25.867 --> 01:35:26.933
Why not?

01:35:26.933 --> 01:35:27.500
And leave all this?

01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:29.067
I got a title.

01:35:29.067 --> 01:35:31.167
I got a throne room.

01:35:31.167 --> 01:35:32.733
I got folks so scared of me they

01:35:32.733 --> 01:35:34.833
Dare not knock on my door.

01:35:34.833 --> 01:35:36.433
Now that's a great way to

01:35:36.433 --> 01:35:38.067
Live.

01:35:38.067 --> 01:35:41.167
Locked inside a fancy prison

01:35:41.167 --> 01:35:42.200
Lest somebody figure out who you

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:43.267
Really are.

01:35:43.267 --> 01:35:44.833
Let her be.

01:35:44.833 --> 01:35:45.900
She got a right to choose the

01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:48.567
Way she wants to live.

01:35:48.567 --> 01:35:50.133
Maybe she don't want no friends

01:35:50.133 --> 01:35:51.700
Or family.

01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:53.300
Maybe she don't care about the

01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:54.333
Wonderful world just beyond

01:35:54.333 --> 01:35:55.933
Those doors.

01:35:55.933 --> 01:35:58.567
Yeah.

01:35:58.567 --> 01:36:00.133
Maybe she don't miss

01:36:00.133 --> 01:36:04.333
Conversatin' or sharing a laugh.

01:36:04.333 --> 01:36:06.467
Maybe she don't need to feel a

01:36:06.467 --> 01:36:09.100
Warm hug or a friendly handshake

01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:10.167
Or a loving kiss ever again.

01:36:10.167 --> 01:36:15.933
Yeah.

01:36:15.933 --> 01:36:17.533
Maybe she wants to be stuck

01:36:17.533 --> 01:36:18.567
In this room, alone in the dark,

01:36:18.567 --> 01:36:19.633
'Til the end of her days.

01:36:19.633 --> 01:36:22.267
Layin' it on a little thick?

01:36:22.267 --> 01:36:23.333
All right.

01:36:23.333 --> 01:36:24.367
All right.

01:36:24.367 --> 01:36:28.067
You made your point.

01:36:28.067 --> 01:36:30.733
I've had a nice vacation, maybe

01:36:30.733 --> 01:36:31.800
It's time to get back to the

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:38.500
Real world.

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:39.700
So, who needs a lift to

01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:40.767
Omaha?

01:36:40.767 --> 01:36:41.833
Me.

01:36:41.833 --> 01:36:43.767
Oh, please, me.

01:37:01.067 --> 01:37:04.300
Citizens of oz.

01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:05.367
There is a time to every purpose

01:37:05.367 --> 01:37:06.933
Under heaven.

01:37:06.933 --> 01:37:09.067
A time to keep.

01:37:09.067 --> 01:37:12.767
And a time to cast away.

01:37:12.767 --> 01:37:13.800
Sadly, I'll admit, now is the

01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:17.467
Time to split.

01:37:17.467 --> 01:37:19.100
Friends, it is not enough to

01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:21.200
Know where you are going.

01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:22.233
You also need to know where you

01:37:22.233 --> 01:37:24.333
Are coming from.

01:37:24.333 --> 01:37:27.500
Today, I go forward to go back.

01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:29.100
But before I do, let me leave

01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:31.067
You with this...

01:37:31.733 --> 01:37:33.833
**

Take what I give you

01:37:54.433 --> 01:37:56.067
And put it up on a shelf *

01:37:56.067 --> 01:37:57.100
* 'cause now it's time

01:37:57.100 --> 01:37:58.133
For this here wiz

01:37:58.133 --> 01:38:00.233

* give me a reason

01:38:06.067 --> 01:38:07.633
Why I should stay

01:38:07.633 --> 01:38:10.267
And I'll judge it

01:38:10.267 --> 01:38:13.400
My mind is made up *

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:15.067

Magic from me *

* but this the greatest magic

01:38:23.433 --> 01:38:24.500
That you'll ever see

01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:25.567
If you blink more than

01:38:25.567 --> 01:38:26.600
One time *

01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:28.733
* the kid will be gone

01:38:28.733 --> 01:38:30.867
And you will have to hook up

01:38:30.867 --> 01:38:32.467
The rest on your own

01:38:32.467 --> 01:38:33.500
And do you know *

01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:36.133

Your work's cut out for you

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:52.667
* I packed all my clothes

01:38:52.667 --> 01:38:53.733
And I packed up my power

01:38:53.733 --> 01:38:54.767
I'm leavin' this place *

01:38:54.767 --> 01:38:55.300
* in less than

01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:56.900
One half an hour

01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:59.067
If you look up in the sky

01:38:59.067 --> 01:39:00.600
You'll know just who it is *

01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.167
* it's not a bird or a plane

01:39:02.167 --> 01:39:04.267
It's just a little ole wiz

01:39:04.267 --> 01:39:05.833
And guess who's on

01:39:05.833 --> 01:39:07.967
After that *

01:39:07.967 --> 01:39:08.967
* y'all got it

01:39:08.967 --> 01:39:10.567
Y'all got it

01:39:10.567 --> 01:39:13.233
Y'all got it

01:39:13.233 --> 01:39:15.333
Talkin' 'bout leavin' here *

01:39:15.333 --> 01:39:16.900
* y'all got it

01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:18.500
Y'all got it

01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:20.600
Y'all got it

01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:23.233
Talkin' 'bout leavin' here *

01:39:23.233 --> 01:39:24.300
* y'all got it

01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:26.400
Y'all got it

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:27.467
Y'all got it

01:39:27.467 --> 01:39:29.567
Y'all got it *

01:39:29.567 --> 01:39:31.167
* y'all got it

01:39:31.167 --> 01:39:32.733
Y'all got it

01:39:32.733 --> 01:39:36.433
Y'all got it *

01:39:36.433 --> 01:39:37.500
* y'all got it

01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:41.567
Y'all got it *

01:39:44.867 --> 01:39:46.500
Y'all got it!

01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:47.533
And now, Dorothy, it's time to

01:39:47.533 --> 01:39:48.567
Fly!

01:39:48.567 --> 01:39:49.633
Dorothy!

01:39:49.633 --> 01:39:53.333
Quick!

01:39:53.333 --> 01:39:55.433
No.

01:39:55.433 --> 01:39:56.500
Wait!

01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:57.533
I don't belong in Omaha.

01:39:57.533 --> 01:39:58.600
What?

01:39:58.600 --> 01:39:59.633
Dorothy, hurry!

01:39:59.633 --> 01:40:00.667
No.

01:40:00.667 --> 01:40:04.900
Go on, miss wiz.

01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:05.433
Are you sure?

01:40:05.433 --> 01:40:06.500
I'm sure.

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:11.767
Goodbye.

01:40:11.767 --> 01:40:12.833
Goodbye.

01:40:12.833 --> 01:40:13.867
But, Dorothy, that was your

01:40:13.867 --> 01:40:15.467
Ride home.

01:40:15.467 --> 01:40:16.533
That's what I thought, but I

01:40:16.533 --> 01:40:24.967
Couldn't have been more wrong.

01:40:24.967 --> 01:40:30.033
Addaperle!

01:40:30.033 --> 01:40:32.800
Dorothy Gale, what are you

01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:35.500
Still doing here?

01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:37.633
You joined the circus?

01:40:37.633 --> 01:40:45.767
These are my friends.

01:40:45.767 --> 01:40:47.767
You figured it out, didn't

01:40:47.767 --> 01:40:50.167
You?

01:40:50.167 --> 01:40:51.033
I think so.

01:40:51.033 --> 01:40:52.033
Omaha was the place I was born.

01:40:52.033 --> 01:40:53.100
But my home, the place I belong,

01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:54.133
Is with aunt em in Kansas.

01:40:54.133 --> 01:40:55.200
Is that right?

01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:56.267
Good girl.

01:40:56.267 --> 01:40:57.300
Home isn't where you live.

01:40:57.300 --> 01:40:58.900
It's where you love.

01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:01.067
I'm so proud of you.

01:41:01.067 --> 01:41:02.067
Does that mean I can go back

01:41:02.067 --> 01:41:03.100
Now?

01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:04.167
Can you take me, please?

01:41:04.167 --> 01:41:08.433
Me?

01:41:08.433 --> 01:41:10.100
Oh, no, no, no.

01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:11.133
Out of my juris-prudence.

01:41:11.133 --> 01:41:33.833
But I may know someone who can.

01:41:33.833 --> 01:41:36.467
Oh, she's beautiful!

01:41:36.467 --> 01:41:37.533
Did I lie?

01:41:37.533 --> 01:41:39.100
Dorothy, this is my sister

01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:40.667
Glinda, the good witch of the

01:41:40.667 --> 01:41:42.800
South.

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:46.500
Hello, Dorothy.

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:48.600
A pleasure to see you up close

01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:50.200
Instead of from far away.

01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:52.833
From far away?

01:41:52.833 --> 01:41:54.400
I've had my eye on you every

01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:56.567
Step of the way.

01:41:56.567 --> 01:41:58.100
I think I already knew that.

01:41:58.100 --> 01:41:59.667
I always felt someone watching

01:41:59.667 --> 01:42:00.733
Over me.

01:42:00.733 --> 01:42:01.767
That's the power of love,

01:42:01.767 --> 01:42:02.800
Baby.

01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:05.467
You are never alone.

01:42:05.467 --> 01:42:07.067
Your aunt em and so many others

01:42:07.067 --> 01:42:14.300
Are keepin' watch on you.

01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:16.200
I'm really tired.

01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:16.933
Would it be all right if I went

01:42:16.933 --> 01:42:17.800
Back home now?

01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:18.867
You've had the power to go

01:42:18.867 --> 01:42:20.433
Home anytime.

01:42:20.433 --> 01:42:21.500
Addaperle, why didn't you tell

01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:24.100
The child?

01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:25.167
I thought maybe she'd like to

01:42:25.167 --> 01:42:29.700
Meet you first.

01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:31.500
It's these shoes, right?

01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:32.567
They have the magic to send me

01:42:32.567 --> 01:42:33.600
Home.

01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:37.467
No, darling.

01:42:37.467 --> 01:42:44.900
The magic is inside you.

01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:46.333
The magic's in you.

01:42:47.533 --> 01:42:49.633
**

01:42:49.633 --> 01:42:51.200
* if you believe

01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:52.267
Within your heart you'll know

01:42:52.267 --> 01:42:55.433
That no one can change

01:42:55.433 --> 01:43:02.833
The path you must go *

01:43:02.833 --> 01:43:08.067
* believe what you feel

01:43:08.067 --> 01:43:11.867
And know you're right

01:43:11.867 --> 01:43:14.667
Because the time will

01:43:14.667 --> 01:43:19.967
Come around *

01:43:19.967 --> 01:43:27.900
* when you say it's yours

01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:32.600
Believe that you can go home

01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:35.267
Believe you can float

01:43:35.267 --> 01:43:38.433
On air *

01:43:38.433 --> 01:43:40.533
* then click your heels

01:43:40.533 --> 01:43:45.833
Three times

01:43:45.833 --> 01:43:48.467
If you believe, oh

01:43:48.467 --> 01:43:55.300
Then you'll be there *

01:43:55.300 --> 01:43:57.933
* believe in yourself

01:43:57.933 --> 01:44:01.633
Right from the start

01:44:01.633 --> 01:44:04.833
Believe in the magic

01:44:04.833 --> 01:44:07.433
Right there in your heart *

01:44:07.433 --> 01:44:10.100
* believe all these things

01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:16.933
Not because I told you to

01:44:16.933 --> 01:44:24.300
But believe in yourself

01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:29.600
Believe in yourself *

01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:33.833
* believe in yourself

01:44:33.833 --> 01:44:46.333
As I believe in you *

01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:56.500
Thank you.

01:44:56.500 --> 01:45:00.200
Remember... click your heels

01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:01.833
Together three times and think

01:45:01.833 --> 01:45:08.133
Of home.

01:45:08.133 --> 01:45:11.333
Come along, addaperle.

01:45:11.333 --> 01:45:12.900
We got a lot of catching up to

01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:13.933
Do.

01:45:13.933 --> 01:45:15.533
Goodbye, Dorothy.

01:45:15.533 --> 01:45:17.633
Goodbye, Dorothy.

01:45:17.633 --> 01:45:19.767
Goodbye, addaperle.

01:45:19.767 --> 01:45:21.867
Thank you, glinda.

01:45:21.867 --> 01:45:26.633
Goodbye.

01:45:26.633 --> 01:45:27.667
Could that be all there is to

01:45:27.667 --> 01:45:29.800
It?

01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:31.900
You just click your heels

01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:33.467
Together three times and you're

01:45:33.467 --> 01:45:34.533
Home?

01:45:34.533 --> 01:45:35.600
It makes no sense, so it must

01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:37.200
Be so.

01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:40.867
The truth is like that.

01:45:40.867 --> 01:45:41.900
But if you'd known before you

01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:42.967
Wouldn't have had to battle

01:45:42.967 --> 01:45:44.533
Evillene or argue with the wiz

01:45:44.533 --> 01:45:46.667
Or even meet me.

01:45:46.667 --> 01:45:47.700
Or me.

01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:50.867
Or me.

01:45:50.867 --> 01:45:52.967
Oh, I wouldn't have missed

01:45:52.967 --> 01:45:56.667
Meeting you for anything.

01:45:56.667 --> 01:46:02.433
Promise that you'll remember me.

01:46:02.433 --> 01:46:09.333
Keep me in your heart.

01:46:09.333 --> 01:46:11.400
And let me, now and then, come

01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:18.300
To mind.

01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:23.267
And maybe, just maybe, if I hang

01:46:23.267 --> 01:46:25.133
On to these shoes, they'll

01:46:25.133 --> 01:46:26.200
Lead me back to you someday.

01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:28.867
Oh, please try.

01:46:28.867 --> 01:46:30.600
I will.

01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:32.167
But right now, I think I hear

01:46:32.167 --> 01:46:34.167
Aunt em calling.

01:46:35.333 --> 01:46:36.900
**

01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:37.967
* when I think of home

01:46:37.967 --> 01:46:39.567
I think of a place

01:46:39.567 --> 01:46:40.633
Where there's love

01:46:40.633 --> 01:46:44.333
Overflowing *

01:46:44.333 --> 01:46:46.433
* I wish I was home

01:46:46.433 --> 01:46:48.067
I wish I was back there

01:46:48.067 --> 01:46:50.667
With the things I've been

01:46:50.667 --> 01:46:53.800
Knowing *

01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:55.400
* wind that makes the

01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:57.067
Tall grass

01:46:57.067 --> 01:46:59.100
Bend into leaning *

01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:00.167
* suddenly the raindrops

01:47:00.167 --> 01:47:01.733
That fall

01:47:01.733 --> 01:47:04.367
Have a meaning *

01:47:04.367 --> 01:47:09.667
* sprinkling the scene

01:47:09.667 --> 01:47:15.967
Makes it all clean

01:47:15.967 --> 01:47:18.100
Maybe there's a chance *

01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:20.733
* for me to go back

01:47:20.733 --> 01:47:25.467
Now that I have some direction

01:47:25.467 --> 01:47:27.567
It sure would be nice to be

01:47:27.567 --> 01:47:29.700
Back home *

01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:31.800
* where there's love and

01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:34.933
Affection

01:47:34.933 --> 01:47:37.067
And just maybe I can

01:47:37.067 --> 01:47:39.167
Convince time *

01:47:39.167 --> 01:47:40.733
* to slow up

01:47:40.733 --> 01:47:41.800
Giving me enough time

01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:42.833
In my life

01:47:42.833 --> 01:47:46.067
To grow up *

01:47:46.067 --> 01:47:50.733
* time, be my friend

01:47:50.733 --> 01:47:57.067
Let me start again

01:47:57.067 --> 01:47:59.700
Suddenly my world's gone

01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:02.367
And changed its face *

01:48:02.367 --> 01:48:03.900
* but still I know where

01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:07.067
I'm going

01:48:07.067 --> 01:48:09.733
I have had my mind

01:48:09.733 --> 01:48:11.833
Spun around in space *

01:48:11.833 --> 01:48:13.400
* and yet I've watched it

01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:17.133
Growing

01:48:17.133 --> 01:48:19.200
And if you're listening God

01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:20.267
Please don't make it *

01:48:20.267 --> 01:48:21.833
* hard to know

01:48:21.833 --> 01:48:22.900
If we should believe

01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:25.533
The things we see *

01:48:25.533 --> 01:48:27.133
* tell us

01:48:27.133 --> 01:48:28.200
Would we try and stay

01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:30.300
Or should we run away

01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:31.867
Or is it better *

01:48:31.867 --> 01:48:35.567
* just to let things be

01:48:35.567 --> 01:48:38.200
Living here in this

01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:41.367
Brand new world

01:48:41.367 --> 01:48:46.100
Might be a fantasy *

01:48:46.100 --> 01:48:51.367
* but it's taught me to love

01:48:51.367 --> 01:48:56.600
So it's real to me

01:48:56.600 --> 01:48:59.233
And I learned that we must

01:48:59.233 --> 01:49:03.967
Look inside our hearts *

01:49:03.967 --> 01:49:06.067
* to find a world

01:49:06.067 --> 01:49:08.700
Full of love *

01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:10.267
* like yours

01:49:10.267 --> 01:49:15.567
Like mine

01:49:15.567 --> 01:49:28.067
Like home **

01:49:30.333 --> 01:49:35.267
Toto, aunt em!
