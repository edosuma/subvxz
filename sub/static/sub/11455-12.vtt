00:23.433 --> 00:26.233
I bought this place for
late nights at the office,

00:26.300 --> 00:28.600
since Megan and I are having problems.

00:30.266 --> 00:31.832
You feel so good.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.966
I can't.

00:41.433 --> 00:43.866
I can't stop thinking
about you with other women.

00:43.933 --> 00:45.299
Take it in all the way.

00:48.366 --> 00:51.099
- Who sent you that?
- You sent it.

00:51.166 --> 00:52.999
That's your fucking email!

00:53.066 --> 00:54.232
I didn't send that.

00:54.300 --> 00:57.333
It didn't just go to me,
too. It went to everybody.

00:58.866 --> 01:00.866
Miss Reade sent
over a video recording of

01:01.000 --> 01:03.066
you having sex with
her in your apartment.

01:03.133 --> 01:04.066
You're through.

01:04.132 --> 01:05.433
Fuck!

01:05.500 --> 01:07.466
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:08.000 --> 01:09.133
Fuck!

01:09.200 --> 01:11.000
Somebody sent the
tape to Chicago Lister.

01:11.066 --> 01:12.299
They just ran a story,

01:12.366 --> 01:15.132
you like getting
paid for sex, don't you?

01:15.200 --> 01:17.233
It turns you on, getting paid.

01:17.566 --> 01:18.899
Say it!

01:26.500 --> 01:29.433
- Should I open a bottle?
- Yes, please.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.300
- Get out of there!
- I'm starving.

01:31.366 --> 01:34.132
Well, it'll be done soon,
you can hold off till then.

01:36.266 --> 01:38.166
- Out!
- Alright, Dad.

01:38.233 --> 01:39.933
Hurt my leg.

01:48.333 --> 01:49.933
It's good to be back.

01:52.133 --> 01:53.399
How are they doing?

01:55.066 --> 01:57.166
Why don't you ask them?

01:57.233 --> 01:59.266
Maybe I'll take them
to a game this weekend.

01:59.333 --> 02:02.366
Did Holgrem get back to
you about Strauss & Hauer?

02:03.433 --> 02:05.499
He did not.

02:05.566 --> 02:08.199
Still waiting for the initial offer.

02:10.300 --> 02:11.433
I'm really happy.

02:11.500 --> 02:14.133
You don't have to keep saying that.

02:18.933 --> 02:20.099
But I am.

02:20.433 --> 02:21.999
It's true.

02:22.933 --> 02:24.099
Then just show us.

03:21.932 --> 03:23.832
Take it in all the way.

03:28.499 --> 03:30.865
You like getting
paid for sex, don't you?

03:30.932 --> 03:33.032
It turns you on, getting paid.

03:35.932 --> 03:36.865
Say it!

03:36.932 --> 03:38.198
It turns me on!

03:54.432 --> 03:56.398
Take it in all the way.

04:01.265 --> 04:03.931
You like getting paid
for sex, don't you?

04:03.999 --> 04:06.199
It turns you on, getting paid.

04:08.365 --> 04:09.431
Say it!

04:09.499 --> 04:11.365
It turns me on!

04:12.999 --> 04:15.232
The white zone is for
immediate loading and unloading

04:15.299 --> 04:18.199
of passengers only. No parking.

04:37.132 --> 04:38.065
Hey!

04:39.535 --> 04:41.098
Here, let me get this for you.

04:41.165 --> 04:42.198
Thanks for picking me up.

04:42.265 --> 04:43.398
Yup.

04:53.299 --> 04:56.099
If you have something
to say, just say it.

04:59.365 --> 05:03.431
We haven't heard from you
since you sent that email.

05:03.565 --> 05:05.865
Why aren't you returning our calls?

05:05.932 --> 05:08.165
Well, what do you want me to say?

05:09.065 --> 05:10.298
Are you serious?

05:11.932 --> 05:14.865
What the fuck is wrong with you?

05:14.932 --> 05:18.498
You sent an email with
a video attached...

05:18.565 --> 05:20.231
of you fucking some dude

05:20.299 --> 05:22.232
to your family and colleagues.

05:22.299 --> 05:24.499
You forced your mother and father

05:24.565 --> 05:27.131
to watch you get rammed by some...

05:27.199 --> 05:28.599
It's not funny.

05:35.132 --> 05:36.498
I didn't send that.

05:39.165 --> 05:40.298
Then who did?

05:42.332 --> 05:44.032
You can tell me.

05:48.199 --> 05:51.365
Look, I know what you were doing.

05:51.432 --> 05:54.065
I can't believe you're a
pro... I can't even say it out loud.

05:54.132 --> 05:56.132
Then don't say it out loud.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.498
Did something happen to you?

05:59.565 --> 06:04.298
Like when you were little?
And you didn't say anything or...?

06:04.931 --> 06:07.864
Because I-I honestly can not understand

06:07.931 --> 06:09.931
why you would do something
so fucking stupid.

06:09.998 --> 06:11.931
Because I like it, okay?

06:41.998 --> 06:44.998
- Do you want help with that?
- No, that's fine.

06:45.064 --> 06:46.430
Are they home?

06:46.498 --> 06:48.698
Yeah, they're here somewhere.

06:49.731 --> 06:50.731
Mom!

06:53.064 --> 06:54.197
Dad!

07:03.198 --> 07:05.664
- Yeah?
- She's here.

07:18.998 --> 07:20.098
They're out here!

07:20.798 --> 07:22.564
Be nice.

07:22.631 --> 07:24.831
- Hey!
- Hey, there!

07:26.264 --> 07:28.997
- Happy Anniversary.
- Oh yeah, thanks.

07:29.064 --> 07:32.464
- So we were hoping you'd you'd come.
- Why wouldn't I come?

07:32.531 --> 07:33.564
Well, you know, we-we know
you're busy, honey.

07:33.631 --> 07:35.731
You've got lots on your plate.

07:36.964 --> 07:38.864
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.

07:38.931 --> 07:39.864
Happy Anniversary.

07:39.931 --> 07:41.064
Thanks.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.931
You're all right?

07:46.998 --> 07:48.764
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:49.864 --> 07:52.497
Well, I made up the couch in the den...

07:52.564 --> 07:54.497
I uh, didn't know you were coming,

07:54.564 --> 07:56.130
so we didn't get a
chance to clean up your room.

07:56.198 --> 07:57.764
I told you guys I was coming.

07:57.831 --> 07:59.131
No, actually,

07:59.198 --> 08:01.831
Ahhh, I haven't heard
from you in a few weeks.

08:02.931 --> 08:04.831
Sorry, sweetie, your, your room,

08:04.898 --> 08:07.064
we kind of turned it into
a bit of a dumping zone.

08:07.131 --> 08:08.164
That's fine.

08:11.398 --> 08:14.198
Okay, well, I need to get ready.

08:14.264 --> 08:15.797
I'm gonna help Mom.

08:15.864 --> 08:17.064
Do you guys need help with anything?

08:17.131 --> 08:18.831
- No, we're okay.
- Yeah, we're good.

08:18.898 --> 08:22.064
Your mom and Annabel picked
up everything last night.

08:22.131 --> 08:23.964
Grandma got in.

08:24.031 --> 08:26.131
She's looking forward to seeing you.

08:26.198 --> 08:28.064
Yeah, I haven't seen Grandma in so long.

08:28.131 --> 08:29.331
Yeah.

08:30.998 --> 08:32.864
Alright, I'm gonna go put
my stuff downstairs.

08:32.931 --> 08:34.831
- Welcome back!
- Thanks, Dad.

08:52.131 --> 08:54.197
That wasn't as bad as I
thought it was gonna be.

08:54.264 --> 08:56.564
I've been here ten minutes. Just wait.

08:56.631 --> 08:58.864
No, she's gonna be caught
up in the party.

08:58.931 --> 08:59.980
It's not gonna be so bad.

09:00.697 --> 09:04.330
I mean, you had to
know that we would be upset.

09:04.397 --> 09:07.497
I wasn't thinking about you
guys when I was fucking him.

09:10.531 --> 09:12.697
What are you wearing to the party?

09:12.764 --> 09:15.497
- Probably something really sexy.
- Okay...

09:16.731 --> 09:18.597
Right, I'm sure Mom will love that.

09:31.531 --> 09:35.464
You ready? One, two, three!

09:47.397 --> 09:49.014
So your mom was just telling us about

09:49.039 --> 09:50.655
what you've been up to in Chicago...

09:50.697 --> 09:52.397
What did she say?

09:52.464 --> 09:53.730
Oh, lots of things...

09:54.597 --> 09:56.530
Uh, your school, your job...

09:56.597 --> 09:58.330
She says you're doing great.

10:03.964 --> 10:05.330
Oh.

10:05.831 --> 10:06.997
Oh, no.

10:08.964 --> 10:10.564
He's like, not again.

10:13.831 --> 10:16.764
I haven't been to Chicago in years.
Is it still as expensive?

10:16.831 --> 10:18.331
Not really.

10:18.397 --> 10:19.897
Ummm... Maybe compared to here.

10:19.964 --> 10:22.330
- That's what people tell me.
- Yeah.

10:22.397 --> 10:23.897
Hey, Gram, can I steal
Christine for a second?

10:23.964 --> 10:25.597
Take her away.

10:27.616 --> 10:30.397
You're not talking to
Gram about the video, are you?

10:30.464 --> 10:31.964
'Cause Mom and Dad don't
want her to know.

10:32.031 --> 10:34.031
Of course, I'm not talking
to Gram about the fucking video!

10:34.097 --> 10:35.397
I'm not an idiot, Annabel!

10:35.464 --> 10:38.664
Okay, well this is all
very unexpected for us.

10:38.731 --> 10:40.971
Well, I'm glad you guys
found a way to make it about you.

10:45.231 --> 10:47.364
What are you gonna do about law school?

10:47.431 --> 10:48.597
I don't know.

10:49.597 --> 10:51.463
Are you going to finish?

10:51.531 --> 10:52.764
I haven't decided.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.130
I don't know how you guys do it...

11:06.764 --> 11:08.230
or did it for

11:08.297 --> 11:10.063
every day for thirty years.

11:10.131 --> 11:11.731
Thank you.

11:11.797 --> 11:13.730
I love you so much!

11:14.664 --> 11:16.730
And I'm not gonna cry. I'm not.

11:18.164 --> 11:20.830
To my mom and dad, everyone.

11:20.897 --> 11:22.463
Cheers!

11:22.531 --> 11:23.491
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

11:23.531 --> 11:24.771
Cheers sweetheart, cheers baby.

11:27.697 --> 11:28.963
I love you.

11:29.031 --> 11:31.464
- Do you want to say anything?
- No.

11:31.531 --> 11:32.897
Just say something.

11:39.031 --> 11:41.675
You guys made Annabel and I believe

11:41.700 --> 11:43.755
that we could be anything.

11:45.531 --> 11:48.764
You made me feel like I
could be whoever I wanted.

11:54.831 --> 11:57.831
Our power got shut off
when I was, I think, three.

11:57.897 --> 11:59.697
Annabel was seven.

11:59.764 --> 12:03.897
Ummm, and I don't know
how, how you did that...

12:03.997 --> 12:07.863
Had children, no money, and
had to explain to them why?

12:07.930 --> 12:08.996
But...

12:09.063 --> 12:10.996
they acted like it was planned.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.096
And-and Dad told me that that's
how the pioneers lived...

12:13.163 --> 12:14.863
So...

12:14.930 --> 12:15.835
we spent the rest of the night

12:15.836 --> 12:19.020
telling scary stories in the dark.

12:19.063 --> 12:22.796
And you guys just made it
seem like a big adventure.

12:23.863 --> 12:24.929
And...

12:24.997 --> 12:26.130
It still is.

12:26.197 --> 12:27.730
And...

12:27.797 --> 12:31.663
I never realized how hard that
must have been for you.

12:33.130 --> 12:34.863
Ummm...

12:34.930 --> 12:36.163
Happy Anniversary!

12:41.797 --> 12:43.763
I am who I am because of you.

13:01.430 --> 13:03.163
Do you want another drink?

13:03.797 --> 13:05.197
- Yes.
- White?

13:05.263 --> 13:06.929
Sure, yeah, if that's okay, thanks.

13:06.997 --> 13:08.363
A red and a white, please.

13:18.763 --> 13:19.863
Thank you.

13:22.997 --> 13:24.063
You're Christine?

13:24.130 --> 13:26.196
Yeah.

13:26.263 --> 13:27.996
I'm Andrew Wyatt, I work at
the high school with your mom.

13:28.063 --> 13:29.563
Oh, cool.

13:29.630 --> 13:32.363
- What do you teach?
- Math and physics.

13:34.197 --> 13:35.897
Nice.

13:35.963 --> 13:37.929
You're studying law at Chicago-Burnham?

13:37.997 --> 13:39.063
Yeah.

13:39.130 --> 13:40.696
Second year, right?

13:40.763 --> 13:41.696
Yeah.

13:44.863 --> 13:47.663
Sorry, I uh, I know all about you.

13:47.730 --> 13:50.096
Your mom talks about you all the time.

13:51.130 --> 13:53.163
I'm sure she does.

13:57.130 --> 13:58.830
You get home often?

13:58.897 --> 14:01.063
"Home" as in "here"?

14:01.197 --> 14:02.397
- Yeah.
- No, no.

14:05.330 --> 14:07.230
I was gonna say next
time you're in town,

14:07.297 --> 14:09.130
we should grab a drink.

14:09.197 --> 14:10.430
Yeah.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.263
Hey!

14:25.330 --> 14:26.963
Hey yourself.

14:27.030 --> 14:28.063
Mom abandon you?

14:28.130 --> 14:29.630
Yeah.

14:29.697 --> 14:33.130
- She's out front with the girls.
- Oh.

14:33.197 --> 14:35.763
- Having a good time?
- Yeah, it's pretty fun.

14:35.830 --> 14:37.130
Yeah, it's a good party.

14:37.197 --> 14:38.997
It's a rager.

14:40.030 --> 14:41.663
Lots of old people.

14:42.797 --> 14:44.430
I got news for you, honey:

14:45.030 --> 14:46.230
We're old.

14:49.330 --> 14:51.130
Wanna dance?

14:51.197 --> 14:52.963
Yeah... Yeah, sure.

15:34.429 --> 15:35.995
Have a safe trip.

15:38.496 --> 15:40.362
Take care. Thanks for coming, guys.

15:40.429 --> 15:42.395
- Great to see you.
- Thanks for having us.

15:42.462 --> 15:44.362
Alright, yeah. We'll be in touch.

15:44.429 --> 15:45.562
Bye, guys.

15:45.629 --> 15:48.362
No, she is doing great...

15:48.429 --> 15:50.895
She loves her internship and

15:50.962 --> 15:52.428
they really love her.

15:52.496 --> 15:54.262
She has one year left in law school?

15:54.329 --> 15:55.595
Yeah.

15:55.662 --> 15:57.262
It's a lot to manage,

15:57.329 --> 15:59.162
but you know, she's always
been really good at juggling things.

15:59.229 --> 16:00.462
Mmm-hmm.

16:00.596 --> 16:03.162
- That's a good quality to have.
- Yeah.

16:04.062 --> 16:05.362
We're very proud.

16:05.429 --> 16:06.529
- You should be.
- Mmm-hmm

16:08.262 --> 16:11.195
Christine, you would be proud of me.

16:11.262 --> 16:12.737
It was really great to be
here, congratulations.

16:12.762 --> 16:13.262
So great.

16:13.296 --> 16:14.462
- Thank you.
- Really beautiful evening.

16:14.529 --> 16:16.009
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to meet you.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.028
- See you Monday.
- You too.

16:17.096 --> 16:18.229
'Night.

16:53.362 --> 16:54.362
Can't sleep?

16:59.396 --> 17:02.229
I'm still wound up from the excitement.

17:03.229 --> 17:05.362
Yeah, we all are.

17:25.762 --> 17:28.262
I had a really good time tonight.

17:31.629 --> 17:35.129
I really liked seeing you
and Dad happy together.

17:41.629 --> 17:43.062
Do you think that

17:43.129 --> 17:46.195
seeing you all over the
internet like that

17:46.262 --> 17:47.562
makes me happy?

17:49.362 --> 17:50.562
Do you?

17:53.062 --> 17:55.528
Do you think that that's
what I had in mind

17:55.596 --> 17:58.196
when your father and
I decided to have you?

18:02.062 --> 18:04.895
Here I thought you were so independent.

18:07.728 --> 18:09.728
I was so proud of you.

18:16.228 --> 18:17.861
You're on your own, all right.

18:38.862 --> 18:42.028
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

18:42.095 --> 18:45.161
I have a job interview.
Dad's gonna take me to the airport.

18:45.228 --> 18:46.994
- On a weekend?
- Yep.

18:49.131 --> 18:51.128
What kind of job are
you interviewing for?

18:51.195 --> 18:53.161
Just another internship.

18:54.028 --> 18:55.228
Stop lying to me.

18:59.262 --> 19:01.728
I don't want to be around Mom.

19:15.662 --> 19:17.228
- Like some breakfast?
- No...

19:17.295 --> 19:18.795
I'll get something at the airport.

19:19.595 --> 19:21.061
- You sure?
- Yeah.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.978
Okay, I'll uh, I'll take
your bag to the car.

19:26.003 --> 19:27.803
Okay.

19:39.762 --> 19:41.062
I'm leaving.

19:44.995 --> 19:46.061
Mom?

19:50.095 --> 19:51.861
I'm leaving.

19:53.128 --> 19:54.261
Okay.

19:58.128 --> 20:00.194
- Have a safe flight.
- Thanks.

20:08.995 --> 20:10.095
- Bye.
- Bye.

20:10.162 --> 20:12.228
- Be careful.
- Okay.

20:12.295 --> 20:13.935
- I'll call you later.
- Okay, I love you.

20:13.962 --> 20:15.062
Love you.

20:32.995 --> 20:34.195
So that uh...

20:34.862 --> 20:35.928
was some video.

20:38.995 --> 20:39.961
I didn't send that.

20:41.795 --> 20:42.995
My ex-boyfriend sent it.

20:43.062 --> 20:45.862
He was mad that I broke up with him.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.294
Is that true?

20:47.828 --> 20:48.794
Yes.

20:55.328 --> 20:58.294
Want me to break his legs?

20:58.362 --> 21:01.762
Yeah, if I don't fucking break
'em first, piece of shit.

21:11.562 --> 21:12.695
Here you go.

21:15.695 --> 21:17.528
Here, honey.

21:17.595 --> 21:19.515
- No, no, no, I don't...
- No, take it, take it.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.061
- Just to cover...
- Honestly, I really don't need it.

21:21.128 --> 21:23.028
Changing your ticket and...

21:23.095 --> 21:26.495
Get yourself a bite to eat
before you get on the plane.

21:31.395 --> 21:33.528
I'm sorry I ruined your anniversary.

21:33.595 --> 21:35.528
Stop it, stop it, hon.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.528
I'm glad you came.

21:37.595 --> 21:38.828
Every-Everybody is.

21:42.595 --> 21:44.328
I love you.

21:44.395 --> 21:46.328
I love you, too, sweetheart.

21:47.728 --> 21:49.228
Safe flight, huh?

22:30.395 --> 22:31.428
I'm back!

22:34.262 --> 22:35.295
Mar...?

22:37.695 --> 22:39.428
Honey!

22:51.862 --> 22:54.595
A little hair of the dog?

22:54.662 --> 22:55.962
Something like that.

22:59.695 --> 23:01.595
Where's Annabel?

23:01.728 --> 23:03.661
Oh, she went to Vanessa's.

23:04.862 --> 23:06.528
How's traffic?

23:06.595 --> 23:08.361
Ahh, it's okay.

23:11.762 --> 23:14.362
You know, honey, that uh, that video...

23:14.428 --> 23:17.528
was shot by a jealous ex-boyfriend.

23:19.662 --> 23:21.495
- Boyfriend?
- Yeah.

23:22.595 --> 23:23.828
Ooohh...

23:23.895 --> 23:25.628
Don't be naive.

23:28.562 --> 23:30.862
She's always loved the attention.

23:31.895 --> 23:34.528
She doesn't care how it affects us.

23:36.662 --> 23:38.462
She's always been selfish.

23:40.728 --> 23:41.994
It's the truth.

24:32.195 --> 24:33.261
There you go.

24:33.328 --> 24:34.594
Spread your legs.

24:37.428 --> 24:39.061
Really slow.

24:43.328 --> 24:44.428
Yeah, that's great.

24:45.561 --> 24:47.927
So how did you find my reel?

24:47.995 --> 24:49.628
- Thanks, guys.
- Online.

24:50.461 --> 24:52.227
You have good reviews.

24:53.428 --> 24:55.228
Alright, that's good.

24:55.295 --> 24:56.395
Great, yeah.

24:57.428 --> 24:59.294
You from Chicago?

24:59.428 --> 25:01.328
Actually I grew up in Paris.

25:02.328 --> 25:03.694
Nice.

25:03.761 --> 25:07.561
Does this kind of
work ever make you scared?

25:07.628 --> 25:10.194
No.
