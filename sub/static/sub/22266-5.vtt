00:02.044 --> 00:03.535
OLIVER: <i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:03.629 --> 00:05.495
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:05.589 --> 00:08.457
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:08.550 --> 00:11.588
<i>But I couldn't honor that commitment
and honor the promise</i>

00:11.678 --> 00:13.340
<i>I made to the mother of my son.</i>

00:13.430 --> 00:15.342
<i>So I asked the best man I know
to help.</i>

00:15.432 --> 00:19.722
<i>His name is John Diggle and he is
the Green Arrow.</i>

00:20.687 --> 00:22.349
OLIVER: <i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

00:22.439 --> 00:25.102
Pollard. She's using last night's
disaster as a pretext

00:25.192 --> 00:28.560
to introduce her anti-vigilante
legislation to the council.

00:28.654 --> 00:31.271
I'm invoking chapter nine
of the city charter.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.652
That would convert
Councilwoman Pollard's bill

00:33.742 --> 00:35.404
to a citywide referendum.

00:35.494 --> 00:36.484
What do you want?

00:36.578 --> 00:37.785
To operate without interference.

00:38.664 --> 00:40.371
So you can keep killing people.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.619
You don't seem to know that
this is a war.

00:42.709 --> 00:45.998
The intel that you gave me on my son,
Joe, panned out...

00:46.129 --> 00:47.290
<i>So I'm heading to Calgary.</i>

00:47.839 --> 00:48.829
Good luck, Slade.

00:52.928 --> 00:55.045
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

01:02.980 --> 01:06.314
Ms. Pollard, Captain wanted you to
see the latest COMPSTAT.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.186
Thanks, Lieutenant.

01:15.701 --> 01:16.691
Sniper!

01:17.369 --> 01:19.156
(CLAMORING)

01:26.503 --> 01:28.916
Officer down. Code three.

01:29.965 --> 01:31.627
Officer down.

01:45.564 --> 01:47.430
Well, I'm just glad no one
was seriously hurt.

01:47.524 --> 01:48.765
How do you want to handle this?

01:48.859 --> 01:50.691
I'd like you to
issue a statement on my behalf.

01:50.777 --> 01:51.938
On your behalf?

01:52.195 --> 01:55.029
I have an old friend in town
that needs my help

01:55.115 --> 01:57.858
and I might not be back in the office
for a few hours.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.822
<i>Do we have any idea who the shooter
was targeting?</i>

01:59.911 --> 02:00.901
We're working on it.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.871
Good. Be the Mayor until I get back.

02:04.499 --> 02:05.489
For real?

02:05.584 --> 02:07.120
No. It's a figure of speech.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.377
Just don't make any laws while
I'm out of the office, okay?

02:10.756 --> 02:11.746
Fine.

02:12.716 --> 02:15.800
And don't worry about the shooter.
We're gonna nail his ass.

02:16.386 --> 02:17.376
I know you will.

02:20.432 --> 02:21.798
Sorry. That was work.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.429
Don't apologize.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.186
I appreciate the meeting.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.139
You helped me find my son.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.815
The least I can do is
help you find Joe.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.855
He doesn't go by that name anymore.

02:34.821 --> 02:35.902
He changed his name?

02:36.198 --> 02:37.405
It was his mother's idea.

02:38.784 --> 02:42.869
Her maiden name.
He goes by "Kane" now.

02:43.914 --> 02:44.904
What happened to him?

02:45.248 --> 02:48.286
I tracked him to Calgary,
but by then he had gone.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.040
So, I followed him to Ibiza,

02:53.256 --> 02:54.792
and then Mombasa.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.169
Mombasa?

02:58.804 --> 03:00.295
The kid took after his father.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.256
While we were stuck on Lian Yu,

03:03.684 --> 03:06.472
he went down and joined
the Australian Intelligence Service.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.562
And a week ago, in Kasnia,

03:09.773 --> 03:11.059
a mission went south.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.272
He was dealing in arms,
some locals caught him.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.688
Supposedly, he didn't
have a fair trial and now he's...

03:20.409 --> 03:22.196
Serving a life sentence.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.277
Like a rat in a cage.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.369
Okay, Slade, what do you need?

03:34.756 --> 03:36.713
I need you to help me find my son.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.422
Last we met, you told me
that I couldn't live in two worlds.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.545
I'm not asking you to
come back in.

03:44.599 --> 03:48.434
Strangely enough,
what I need is diplomacy,

03:50.230 --> 03:51.562
which means I don't want Green Arrow,

03:52.524 --> 03:53.605
I need Oliver Queen.

03:53.942 --> 03:54.932
For what?

03:56.319 --> 03:58.481
Can I ask you just to trust me
on this one, kid?

03:59.614 --> 04:01.401
I've organized transport to Kasnia.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.695
Wheels up at 2200.

04:06.455 --> 04:08.242
I'll understand if you don't want
to join me.

04:12.127 --> 04:16.120
But if you do, I'll meet you
out front at 2100.

04:17.339 --> 04:18.329
Okay, kid?

04:29.394 --> 04:30.555
Okay, bring that stuff over here.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.180
Sorry.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.233
Hey, don't worry.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.152
It's only tent poles.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.315
It's not like we're gonna
stick around long enough to use them.

04:47.829 --> 04:48.865
Why'd you say that?

04:49.956 --> 04:53.449
You're always leaving. I can't
believe we even made it this far.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.535
Listen, you know
that I work for Australian Airlines

04:55.629 --> 04:56.665
and I have to travel.

04:57.339 --> 04:58.375
But I promise you,

04:58.882 --> 05:00.794
this weekend, it's just about
you and me.

05:01.718 --> 05:04.256
Father and son. Out in the wild.

05:06.389 --> 05:09.177
Come on. Go find some flat land,
and pitch a tent.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.901
Got him.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.569
Well, I didn't get him, get him,
but I've identified him.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.863
- Identified who?
- Our sniper.

05:24.699 --> 05:26.190
I thought your T-Spheres could
track his visor.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.650
Well, that was then.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.911
This is apparently now.
He must have hacked the tracer.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.204
Or got a new visor.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.202
It's not like they sell 'em
at Wal-Mart, Felicity.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.750
Guys, update time. I think
our vigilante's back in town.

05:36.837 --> 05:37.918
He's the shooter?

05:38.171 --> 05:39.582
I saw him coming out
of the sniper's nest.

05:39.923 --> 05:41.289
CSU's here.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.333
I don't know how much evidence
we'll be able to pull.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.883
<i>Why don't we work with what we have?</i>

05:44.970 --> 05:48.134
Mainly, the Vigilante seemed to be
targeting Councilwoman Pollard.

05:48.223 --> 05:49.589
"Seemed to be" being
the operative word.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.970
Well, Pollard's the one who's
championing the anti-vigilante bills.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.347
Seems like a guy named "Vigilante"
wouldn't like her much.

05:54.437 --> 05:55.427
JOHN: <i>Yeah. But martyr her?</i>

05:55.647 --> 05:57.309
That'd get this bill passed faster

05:57.399 --> 05:58.435
than you could say "obstruction."

05:58.984 --> 06:01.522
If it passes, I'm gonna
have to consider arresting myself.

06:03.655 --> 06:06.568
Excuse me. What are you doing here?

06:07.534 --> 06:08.570
You're not SCPD.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.152
No, he's not. And this is not a
federal case.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.074
Still doesn't explain what
John Diggle,

06:13.164 --> 06:16.282
who works personal security for
the mayor, is doing at a crime scene.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.708
I have relevant experience, and

06:18.169 --> 06:20.286
the mayor thought this could use
a fresh set of eyes.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.004
What type of experience?

06:23.592 --> 06:24.582
Sniper.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.251
I don't recall reading that in your
military file.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.304
I'm sorry, tell me again, why you're
reviewing my service jacket?

06:30.599 --> 06:32.761
Mayor Queen didn't
mention he was under investigation?

06:32.851 --> 06:34.433
Of course he did,
it has nothing to do with this.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.431
But you've been working with him
for the past six years.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.846
Which makes us overdue for a chat.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.608
I can wait for a subpoena
if you prefer.

06:42.819 --> 06:43.935
No. I'm an open book.

06:45.196 --> 06:46.232
Step into my office.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.315
Uh-uh.

06:49.826 --> 06:50.816
Private conversation.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.198
Hey, William.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.283
Hi.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.079
How are those
quadratic equations going?

07:03.590 --> 07:04.580
I hate them.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.249
Yeah, those were the days.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.043
Where's your dad?

07:08.136 --> 07:09.172
In his room.

07:12.891 --> 07:13.927
Huh.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.178
Do you remember when our biggest
problem in life

07:15.268 --> 07:16.725
was solving a quadratic equation?

07:16.937 --> 07:17.927
Mmm-mmm.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.139
I mean, I never really worried
about them, but no.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.980
Well, now, we have metas crashing
bachelorette parties, so...

07:25.904 --> 07:29.523
Wow. Slade invited you on
a romantic getaway?

07:29.741 --> 07:30.857
Something like that.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.738
Where? Don't say Aruba.
That's our spot.

07:33.536 --> 07:34.743
(SIGHS) Kasnia.

07:34.955 --> 07:35.991
Wow!

07:36.206 --> 07:38.414
His son is in some trouble.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.457
The kind of trouble you need
to get in more trouble to fix it?

07:40.543 --> 07:44.503
Well, Slade says that
he has a diplomatic solution

07:44.589 --> 07:47.297
that requires my name
and not me in a mask.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.465
I'm worried that If I don't go,

07:48.551 --> 07:50.167
he will take
a more aggressive approach.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.009
So the empty bag,
is that second thoughts?

07:54.099 --> 07:56.887
Or can't decide what T-shirt to pack?

07:58.937 --> 07:59.927
Because I'm out.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.646
I made a promise to my son and

08:02.732 --> 08:03.939
I'm out.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.687
It sounds like you made a
promise to Slade, too.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.435
You think I should go?

08:07.529 --> 08:09.270
It's not like you're going back to
your old life.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.781
I wanted you to tell me
not to go.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.526
Look, Slade is not
my favorite person, but...

08:17.163 --> 08:18.404
I mean, it's not about Slade.

08:20.667 --> 08:21.657
It's about his son.

08:22.627 --> 08:25.085
If you don't go, you're just gonna
beat yourself up about it.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.754
If, when, it veers from diplomacy,
and I have to break

08:27.841 --> 08:31.255
my promise to William, I will beat
myself up over that too.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.085
- Then tell William what you're doing.
- What?

08:33.722 --> 08:37.716
Spare him the details of,
you know, Slade being Slade

08:37.892 --> 08:39.975
and tell him that you are
helping a friend.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.094
He'll understand that.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.439
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

08:46.818 --> 08:47.899
He's his father's son.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.394
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

09:10.550 --> 09:11.540
How long is this flight?

09:15.805 --> 09:17.171
It's about 12 hours.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.181
Thanks for coming, kid.

09:21.603 --> 09:22.593
Let's go get your boy.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.098
(LOCK BEEPS)

09:44.084 --> 09:45.200
SCPD!

09:49.631 --> 09:50.621
<i>Hey!</i>

10:00.892 --> 10:01.882
Stay down.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.562
(GASPS)

10:14.781 --> 10:15.771
It's you.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.066
(GATE RATTLES)

10:34.050 --> 10:35.632
Got your 9-1-1. Is everything okay?

10:36.803 --> 10:39.261
Look at her face.
That is not an "okay" face.

10:41.808 --> 10:42.798
Dinah?

10:44.936 --> 10:47.599
Vigilante made another move on
Councilwoman Pollard tonight.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.097
I almost got him.

10:50.567 --> 10:53.355
It's cool, D.
We'll nail that bastard.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.065
I hit him with my cry.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.149
I shattered his visor
and he took off his mask.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.279
I saw his face.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.654
Can you ID him?

11:06.457 --> 11:08.198
His name is Vincent Sobel.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.378
He's my old partner.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.664
I'm sorry. When you say partner,

11:14.757 --> 11:17.500
do you mean partner,
or do you mean, "partner"?

11:17.594 --> 11:18.584
Both.

11:18.928 --> 11:19.918
Now I'm confused.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.879
Dinah, I thought you said
your partner died in the line.

11:22.140 --> 11:25.975
He was shot in the head
right in front of me.

11:28.146 --> 11:31.355
No!

11:36.779 --> 11:39.317
Okay, well, I know you believe
you saw what you saw tonight,

11:39.407 --> 11:42.400
but it was night, probably dark.

11:42.744 --> 11:43.951
It was him, Felicity.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.203
It was Vincent. I know it.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.581
I know it sounds crazy.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.291
Dinah, this doesn't change anything.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.332
We have to find him before he hurts
anyone else.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.413
I know.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.379
I know. Where are you
with the shell casing John found?

11:59.469 --> 12:01.210
The casing
appears to be magnetized.

12:01.304 --> 12:02.294
Bullets aren't magnetic.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.595
They can be if they are stored
in an environment

12:03.681 --> 12:05.013
with a strong magnetic field.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.516
You think it's something
you can trace?

12:12.690 --> 12:13.726
I like your optimism.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.770
It's not optimism, Felicity.

12:16.194 --> 12:17.184
It's faith.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.940
Dinah said that you had a chat
with our FBI BFF?

12:22.242 --> 12:24.359
Oh, yes. She's tough,

12:24.953 --> 12:26.239
but I pushed back pretty hard.

12:26.329 --> 12:27.319
Can we put that to bed?

12:27.705 --> 12:28.741
- (PHONE RINGING)
- Good.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.490
Hello?

12:33.253 --> 12:34.710
Special Agent Watson...

12:35.171 --> 12:37.754
Yes, sure. I can come by tomorrow,
no problem.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.414
All right, see you then.

12:40.635 --> 12:41.671
Definitely not put to bed.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.471
So where's your point of contact?

12:46.683 --> 12:47.673
I don't know.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.554
His name's Nylander.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.014
A foreign associate of mine
from back in the service days.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.767
He was a bit of a jackarse
and never on time.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.641
NYLANDER: <i>He's not that bad.</i>

12:58.569 --> 12:59.559
(CHUCKLES)

12:59.654 --> 13:00.690
Slade Wilson.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.104
<i>The Terminator.</i>

13:02.740 --> 13:04.231
I haven't heard that name in a while.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.075
So, you're running later than usual.

13:07.245 --> 13:08.577
Yeah, I was with a girl.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.237
Forget about it. Look at you.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.827
Mirakuru did you wonders.

13:13.668 --> 13:16.376
Now what? You're not sensitive
about that shit, are you?

13:17.588 --> 13:19.124
You were quite the madman, I hear.

13:19.674 --> 13:20.881
You promised me something.

13:21.259 --> 13:22.249
Did you bring it?

13:22.677 --> 13:25.135
Or did I waste my time traveling
7,000 miles

13:25.221 --> 13:26.337
for you to screw with me?

13:27.056 --> 13:28.046
Truth be told,

13:29.434 --> 13:30.925
I'm glad you got your marbles back.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.345
So who's this?

13:36.316 --> 13:38.273
He's a friend of mine.
Don't worry about him.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.392
With you, I always worry.

13:41.863 --> 13:42.853
This should work.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.154
Thank you.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.406
That's it? Just thank you?

13:46.617 --> 13:48.654
No extravagant dinner? No pints?

13:49.412 --> 13:50.493
Maybe next time,

13:50.705 --> 13:52.867
when my son's not
rotting in a third world prison.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.491
He's lucky to have you as a father.

13:56.878 --> 13:58.494
My son wouldn't be in this mess,

13:58.755 --> 14:00.246
if anybody else was his father.

14:01.632 --> 14:02.998
Just be careful, comrade.

14:03.634 --> 14:06.547
Your boy was snooping around
some private-op mercenaries.

14:06.637 --> 14:08.219
Some not-so-nice guys.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.676
Under certain circumstances,

14:14.520 --> 14:15.761
I'm not so nice a guy.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.105
Yeah, not so big in the decoration,
are you?

14:26.574 --> 14:28.861
I'm less enthusiastic for people
wasting my time.

14:28.951 --> 14:29.941
Okay.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.618
You're seeing Oliver Queen again.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.947
Yeah. These new prescription glasses
are really working wonders. (CHUCKLES)

14:36.667 --> 14:39.910
Just a little FBI interrogation
humor, you know.

14:40.922 --> 14:42.038
You are Mr. Queen's alibi

14:42.131 --> 14:43.872
for certain evenings where
the Green Arrow is active.

14:43.966 --> 14:44.956
If you say so.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.551
My point is, are you prepared to
testify under oath,

14:47.637 --> 14:49.253
under the pains and penalties
of perjury,

14:49.347 --> 14:50.679
in support of those alibis?

14:51.015 --> 14:52.005
Yeah. Absolutely.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.049
100%.

14:54.602 --> 14:55.592
Super ready.

14:55.686 --> 14:56.676
(PHONE CHIMES)

15:01.317 --> 15:02.353
Everything all right?

15:03.111 --> 15:04.101
Mmm-hmm.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.571
Yeah. I'm just late for
a coffee date.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.824
- So, I'd like to...
- Go.

15:11.369 --> 15:12.359
Go.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.992
Thank you. This was pleasant.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.495
I call this play Liberty Watch.

15:23.172 --> 15:26.256
A famous American mayor comes
to small war-torn Kasnia,

15:26.759 --> 15:29.718
to fight for the release of a man
who has been wrongfully accused.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.215
This is very clever.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.843
<i>Like I said,
it's a "diplomatic solution."</i>

15:34.058 --> 15:37.017
Well, Slade, still. I don't think
that they're gonna free your son,

15:37.103 --> 15:39.311
just because I give him a photo op.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.309
No. The photo op is just
to gain entry.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.978
Of course, they'll need a reason
to release him.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.061
And here are 50,000.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.443
Assuming this works,

15:51.200 --> 15:52.190
where do we meet?

15:52.452 --> 15:53.568
When you pick up Joe,

15:54.328 --> 15:55.489
go straight to the airport.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.659
Here is an alias passport for him

15:58.040 --> 15:59.326
and tickets for you both

15:59.876 --> 16:00.866
to London.

16:06.382 --> 16:07.714
You're not even gonna see him?

16:09.927 --> 16:11.134
I need you to promise me

16:11.804 --> 16:13.090
that you won't tell him I helped.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.176
No. I'm not gonna lie to your son.

16:15.641 --> 16:16.848
It's better this way.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.138
For him or for you?

16:20.688 --> 16:21.724
Wait, are you...

16:22.607 --> 16:25.941
Are you afraid that he's gonna
see you as Deathstroke

16:27.612 --> 16:28.602
and not the man you were? The...

16:30.448 --> 16:32.189
The man I think you are now.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.775
I gave up my right to be his father

16:36.037 --> 16:37.573
when I stepped out of the light

16:37.955 --> 16:39.162
into shadows

16:40.333 --> 16:41.744
and became this monster.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.039
Your son will forgive you

16:45.963 --> 16:47.329
the way that my son forgave me.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.048
Joe knew that I was coming
to look for him

16:50.801 --> 16:52.167
so he contacted his mother

16:53.513 --> 16:55.129
and she sent me a message

16:55.223 --> 16:56.339
to stay away.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.637
You got your second chance, kid.

17:02.855 --> 17:03.936
And I'm happy for you.

17:07.859 --> 17:10.397
Some fathers aren't that lucky.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.446
So tell me this is not the freshest
fish that somebody's caught for you.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.039
I don't even like fish.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.329
Not all fish are the same.

17:26.127 --> 17:27.117
Trust me, kid.

17:32.343 --> 17:33.584
Are you really a pilot?

17:35.429 --> 17:36.419
Of course, I am.

17:36.764 --> 17:37.754
Stop lying.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.007
Why are you being like this?

17:40.101 --> 17:41.512
We never get free trips.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.015
My friend Nick's dad flies
for Ferris Air.

17:45.856 --> 17:47.267
They get free trips all the time.

17:51.112 --> 17:53.604
WOMAN: Here, honey, keep up.
BOY: Okay.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.658
Unfortunately, I work
for a cheaper airline

18:02.748 --> 18:05.582
that doesn't allow for
free vacations.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.793
Whatever. I'm not hungry.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.384
Don't walk too far.

18:28.065 --> 18:30.182
This place used to house
MRI machines.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.268
We are in the right place.
That's all that matters.

18:33.487 --> 18:34.773
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.153
How was it with Watson?

18:36.407 --> 18:37.443
Terrifying.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.069
We knew she was planning
a case against Oliver,

18:39.160 --> 18:41.823
but I'm starting to think her net
is widening to include us.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.487
She hasn't contacted me yet.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.117
Wait, why hasn't she?

18:45.207 --> 18:46.539
How about we not worry about this

18:46.626 --> 18:48.709
while we're in the lair
of a psycho-killer?

18:49.045 --> 18:50.161
- Sorry.
<i>- Here.</i>

18:56.385 --> 18:58.342
There's enough ordinance here
for a small war.

18:58.763 --> 19:00.629
You don't need this many bullets
for one councilwoman.

19:02.224 --> 19:05.717
When you called Vince
a psycho-killer, you weren't wrong.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.731
Mr. Queen...

19:16.030 --> 19:17.271
Thank you for taking the time.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.356
It is not every day I meet celebrity.

19:19.617 --> 19:20.653
I'm not famous.

19:20.743 --> 19:21.984
I saw you on news once.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.493
You punched man with camera.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.200
Yup, I sure did.

19:26.290 --> 19:30.534
They also say you are quite good
with bow and arrow.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.711
Oh, don't believe everything
that you see on TV.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.044
Okay, okay.

19:35.299 --> 19:38.383
I understand you are
with organization in hopes to...

19:38.469 --> 19:40.506
To request the release
of one of your prisoners.

19:41.764 --> 19:42.754
Kane Wolfman.

19:43.808 --> 19:44.798
(SIGHS)

19:44.892 --> 19:46.349
I wish you come earlier.

(DOOR OPENS)

20:02.410 --> 20:03.571
What're you doing back here?

20:07.623 --> 20:08.613
Where is my son?

20:10.835 --> 20:11.825
(SIGHS)

20:11.919 --> 20:16.289
There was a...
A fight in the prison yard

20:16.382 --> 20:19.716
that Joe tried to break up.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.637
Someone pushed,
and he hit his head...

20:27.309 --> 20:28.299
He's gone.

20:39.947 --> 20:40.937
He never knew.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.566
Never knew what?

20:47.496 --> 20:49.283
(SHUDDERING)

20:49.999 --> 20:50.989
That I loved him.

20:51.709 --> 20:52.745
I'm sure he did, Slade.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.330
I don't remember the last time

20:58.174 --> 20:59.164
I told him...

20:59.425 --> 21:00.666
Well, you were his father.

21:01.469 --> 21:02.459
Trust me, he knew.

21:07.808 --> 21:11.017
I should have come with you
to the prison.

21:12.563 --> 21:14.475
I know it wouldn't have
made any difference, but,

21:16.358 --> 21:17.690
at least I could have seen him...

21:20.154 --> 21:21.190
Say goodbye.

21:23.866 --> 21:24.982
Well, you still can.

21:28.579 --> 21:29.660
You can still say goodbye.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.714
Joe! Good catch.

21:41.717 --> 21:42.707
Come on.

21:42.802 --> 21:43.792
We are not here to mope around.

21:46.597 --> 21:47.587
(CHUCKLES)

21:51.268 --> 21:52.258
Excuse me,

21:53.646 --> 21:55.228
could you take a photo of
my son and I?

21:55.314 --> 21:56.304
Sure.

22:02.988 --> 22:03.978
(CAMERA CLICKS)

22:06.158 --> 22:07.194
I'm Slade.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.274
Darryl. Nice to meet you.

22:08.369 --> 22:09.359
This is my son, Joe.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.785
- Hey, Joe.
- Nice to meet you.

22:24.760 --> 22:25.750
JOHN: Don't burn yourself out, Dinah.

22:28.222 --> 22:29.429
We need you
for the long haul, remember?

22:29.932 --> 22:33.721
There's no long haul.
We're putting this bastard down.

22:33.811 --> 22:36.053
Remember, this bastard was
your partner and your boyfriend.

22:36.146 --> 22:37.933
I don't need you
to remind me of that, thanks.

22:38.023 --> 22:41.516
(CHUCKLES) No, you don't need me
to remind you of that.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.272
But you do need someone
to point out the fact

22:43.362 --> 22:45.570
that perhaps a part of you
should be happy to have him back.

22:46.949 --> 22:49.817
John, when Vince died, I did
my absolute best to kill myself.

22:51.328 --> 22:53.285
I became somebody
I didn't even recognize.

22:53.873 --> 22:54.863
To avenge somebody

22:54.957 --> 22:56.448
who I don't even recognize anymore.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.828
Somebody who kills innocent people.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.830
You and Vince went through
something horrific.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.661
You some did things you regret.

23:01.755 --> 23:03.872
Maybe there's a part of you
that's putting that on him.

23:03.966 --> 23:05.377
John, he's a psychopath.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.800
It doesn't change the fact that
he's someone who needs help, Dinah.

23:08.637 --> 23:09.627
Just like you did.

23:11.140 --> 23:15.475
Sorry to interrupt, but we've got
two new problems.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.723
Pollard's headed over
to do a sit-down with Channel 52

23:17.813 --> 23:19.645
to talk about
the anti-vigilante referendum.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.223
Wait, no, that station is not secure.

23:21.317 --> 23:22.649
SCPD cannot protect her there.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.271
That's why I said
we've got a problem.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.478
- What's the second one?
- Agent Watson's subpoenaed me.

23:27.323 --> 23:28.313
I gotta go right?

23:28.532 --> 23:30.945
Yeah. That's usually what
a subpoena means. You have to go.

23:31.035 --> 23:32.276
Well, I'm gonna head
to the news station,

23:32.369 --> 23:34.361
see if I can get Pollard
some extra protection.

23:34.455 --> 23:37.118
- Dinah, if Vince tries anything...
- I know, John, I got it.

23:41.003 --> 23:44.496
Mr. Queen, I was not expecting
a return visit.

23:48.010 --> 23:50.548
Warden, this is
Kane Wolfman's father.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.213
He wishes to see his son's body.

23:54.308 --> 23:56.049
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

23:56.352 --> 23:57.342
Why?

23:57.603 --> 23:59.014
You said he passed only days ago.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.562
- Yes, but...
- Warden. Where's the body?

24:02.650 --> 24:05.393
It is no longer in my possession.

24:06.487 --> 24:08.570
Where is my son's body?

24:08.948 --> 24:10.940
Hey. Easy. Easy.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.110
He's lying.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.663
Do you want me to contact
Liberty Watch?

24:19.041 --> 24:20.703
Do you want me to cause
an international incident?

24:20.793 --> 24:22.000
Because I'm prepared to do both.

24:22.086 --> 24:24.043
The situation is complicated.

24:24.129 --> 24:25.540
- Well, un-complicate it.
- Hey.

24:28.342 --> 24:29.332
Trust me on this one.

24:31.261 --> 24:32.593
Don't make this man angry.

24:36.225 --> 24:38.512
They're called the Jackals.

24:39.687 --> 24:41.349

24:42.481 --> 24:45.064

which was merely him being

24:45.150 --> 24:46.812
in the wrong place at the wrong time,

24:47.403 --> 24:49.235
they broke into prison.
Take him.

24:49.822 --> 24:50.938
Why did they take him?

24:51.532 --> 24:57.449
Torture. Your son is spy.
In his head, secrets worth millions.

24:58.914 --> 25:02.078
They threatened reprisal on my family
if I spoke about it.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.497
Slade. Slade.

25:05.587 --> 25:08.955
When the Jackals took my son, they
didn't count on who his father was.

25:17.975 --> 25:20.308
Okay. Every single person
in that line is ID'd twice.

25:20.394 --> 25:21.976
You got it? I don't care
if it's your mother.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.928
And I want two officers
at every emergency exit

25:24.023 --> 25:25.184
and I need somebody
to move this car.

25:28.402 --> 25:30.234
Lieutenant Drake.
Good to see you again.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.861
All right. We're nearly ready to move
on the news station.

25:39.955 --> 25:40.991
Dinah's already on site.

25:41.665 --> 25:42.655
Copy.

25:44.001 --> 25:44.991
Emailing Oliver?

25:45.502 --> 25:48.245
Yeah, I'm just sending Oliver
some info he asked me for.

25:48.338 --> 25:50.751
You know, for his adventures
with Slade.

25:51.425 --> 25:53.712
Are you having as much trouble with
Oliver working with Slade as I am?

25:53.802 --> 25:54.792
No.

25:55.137 --> 25:56.298
Having a lot more.

25:57.181 --> 26:01.016
Rationally, I know that it was the
Mirakuru that made him a jerk, but...

26:01.101 --> 26:04.139
But he wasn't on Mirakuru
when he left us on Lian Yu.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.219
Exactly.

26:05.314 --> 26:07.806
It's ironic that Oliver has more
honor than the man he's helping.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.516
Ironic isn't the word I would use.

26:10.486 --> 26:11.567
DINAH: <i>Guys, we've got a problem.</i>

26:11.653 --> 26:13.019
If I had a nickel for every time
I heard that...

26:13.113 --> 26:16.447
Listen, I'm gonna need you to
stand down. Okay? Do not come here.

26:16.533 --> 26:17.819
Dinah, we're not standing down.

26:17.910 --> 26:18.991
We are not leaving you
out there alone.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.319
I'm not alone.

26:21.497 --> 26:23.409
<i>Agent Watson is here.
And she brought friends.</i>

26:23.624 --> 26:25.365
She's hoping
the Green Arrow will show up.

26:25.793 --> 26:27.830
But you guys stay put, okay?
I got this.

26:35.135 --> 26:37.843
I asked Felicity for any intel
she could find on the Jackals.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.763
She hacked the databases of every
major intelligence agency

26:40.849 --> 26:41.839
in the world.

26:42.309 --> 26:43.641
- And what did she find?
- Nothing.

26:43.727 --> 26:45.389
These guys are ghosts.

26:47.564 --> 26:48.645
That's no help.

26:48.732 --> 26:49.768
This is.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.599
Using closed circuits cameras
in the prison

26:51.693 --> 26:53.355
and surrounding areas,
she got their escape route,

26:53.445 --> 26:56.233
the license plates and then
using keyhole satellite technology...

26:56.323 --> 26:57.814
She tracked them to one location.

26:57.908 --> 26:58.898
Yes. She did.

26:58.992 --> 27:00.984
She's brilliant. How did you get her?

27:02.496 --> 27:03.907
I ask myself that every day.

27:07.876 --> 27:08.866
What's in there for me?

27:09.545 --> 27:10.581
Nothing.

27:10.671 --> 27:12.708
I promised you. Your only part
in this was talking.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.380
Circumstances have changed.

27:15.551 --> 27:16.541
Not for you.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.922
You've got your feet
planted in one world.

27:19.012 --> 27:20.594
- And you should keep them there.
- Slade!

27:20.806 --> 27:22.672
These Jackals are the best
of the worst.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.882
All right?
They're stone-cold killers.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.392
And what do you think I am?

27:27.479 --> 27:29.015
I think that you're outnumbered.

27:29.398 --> 27:31.640
And quite frankly, I think
that you're out of practice

27:31.859 --> 27:33.896
and I am not letting you
do this alone.

27:51.587 --> 27:52.623

28:04.808 --> 28:05.798
Not bad.

28:17.696 --> 28:18.857
I have to go to the bathroom.

28:20.574 --> 28:21.564
I'll be back soon.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.954
You are Xien Ming, an agent
for the Ministry of Defense,

28:35.047 --> 28:36.583

28:36.673 --> 28:39.507
I'm looking for an agent
who you black-bagged.

28:39.885 --> 28:40.966
Called Yao Fei.

28:42.012 --> 28:44.971
You have 10 seconds
to tell me where he is.

Hey. He's with me.

29:06.954 --> 29:08.616
Excuse me. He's with me.
Let him through.

29:10.666 --> 29:13.124
You guys can make sure that perimeter
is secure over on the side there.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.543
I thought I told you to stand down.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.962
Don't worry.
I left the hoodie at home.

29:18.548 --> 29:21.040
Well, then, what are you doing here,
John? I told you I got it.

29:21.301 --> 29:24.294
But I realized, you're not exactly
in your right head.

29:24.888 --> 29:26.129
My head is fine.

29:26.223 --> 29:28.465
Thank you. Your little pep talk
really got through to me.

29:29.393 --> 29:30.759
Dinah, you're a lousy liar.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.186
He didn't always make bullets.

29:42.781 --> 29:43.771
Vince.

29:45.200 --> 29:48.034
He used to make this matchbox art,

29:48.120 --> 29:51.989
with a tiny little paper rose
on the inside.

29:54.251 --> 29:56.709
He made me one the morning
Sonos found out we were undercover.

29:59.548 --> 30:03.258
There is nothing left of that man
anymore, John.

30:03.343 --> 30:05.630
Dinah, earlier this year,
when he attacked Oliver's limo,

30:05.721 --> 30:08.429
he had the chance to kill you,
and he didn't.

30:08.515 --> 30:09.596
- Your point?
- My point is

30:09.683 --> 30:11.720
that maybe there's something
left of the man you used to love.

30:13.395 --> 30:14.385
If there isn't,

30:15.814 --> 30:17.271
I'm going to put him down.

30:18.358 --> 30:20.941
And this time, he'll stay dead.

30:21.194 --> 30:23.277
- Dinah, will you just...
- You better get out of here,

30:23.780 --> 30:24.941

with Miss Emily Pollard.

- It's my pleasure.

30:37.878 --> 30:41.747
JANE: <i>And we're going to hear thoughts
on the anti-vigilante referendum.</i>

30:42.466 --> 30:43.456

Pretty quiet, Lieutenant.

30:45.260 --> 30:48.298
The place is locked tight.
He's not getting in here.

30:58.231 --> 31:01.190
What we need is legislation
to deter others

31:01.276 --> 31:02.938
from joining this vigilante movement
in the future.

31:03.570 --> 31:05.903
We need to take those vigilantes
off the streets.

31:06.281 --> 31:07.692
You don't think they serve a role?

31:07.783 --> 31:09.115
Cops serve that role.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.443
The department's been full of
corrupt cops in the past.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.202
And on top of that,
we're shorthanded.

31:13.663 --> 31:15.325
All I know, Lieutenant,

31:16.041 --> 31:18.328
is if people take the law
into their own hands,

31:18.960 --> 31:19.996
we've got anarchy.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.584

Kill us all and save your boy?

41:04.504 --> 41:05.620
Kind of reductive, no?

41:06.130 --> 41:07.746
I like to keep things simple.

41:09.676 --> 41:11.087
Things rarely are, brother.

41:12.804 --> 41:13.920
Well, this is.

41:15.890 --> 41:17.927
I will join the Jackals

41:19.727 --> 41:21.719
as long as you let my boy go.

41:27.902 --> 41:28.938
NYLANDER: It's like I said.

41:30.571 --> 41:31.687
Things aren't so simple.

41:33.032 --> 41:34.022
We need your son.

41:37.870 --> 41:39.577
After all, he's our boss.

41:47.130 --> 41:48.120
Hello, Father.

41:50.925 --> 41:51.915
It's been a long time.
