WEBVTT

00:00.240 --> 00:01.560
Previously.

00:01.560 --> 00:05.560
We unanimously elect you Endicotts
our hospital's first family.

00:06.040 --> 00:09.360
There's recent evidence
that surgery may prolong your life.

00:09.360 --> 00:11.080
Her vitals are dropping like a rock.

00:11.080 --> 00:13.000
You're killing her. Get it right!

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Wayne said it's all right
for him to take me out.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.840
No, it's not, I wanna be with Wayne.

00:17.840 --> 00:19.040
I wanna be with Clancy.

00:19.040 --> 00:21.240
I wanna be with Boomer.  I wanna be
           with Mona.

00:21.240 --> 00:22.960
     Checked the tests, Bobby.

00:22.960 --> 00:25.760
    Positive, HTLV3 antibodies.

00:25.760 --> 00:29.760
I've got AIDS?

02:03.080 --> 02:05.680
Do you have anything else to do?

02:05.680 --> 02:08.440
I've been waiting
to talk to you, sir.  What for?

02:08.440 --> 02:12.440
Today's my community service
assignment.

02:15.960 --> 02:19.960
Do you have a quarter?
Erm... no. He's good for it!

02:21.040 --> 02:25.040
I just wanna say I'm ready, willing
and able to do my volunteer best.

02:37.520 --> 02:38.560
              Clear.

02:38.560 --> 02:41.560
         She's struggling.

02:41.560 --> 02:44.640
        Well...not now, Ma.

02:44.640 --> 02:47.480
                OK.

02:47.480 --> 02:50.200
  Not now, Dad. I can do it, OK?

02:50.200 --> 02:53.440
     I can do it. I can do it.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.920
Doctor Chandler?

02:54.920 --> 02:58.920
Doctor Chandler?

02:59.120 --> 03:01.400
You were dreaming.  What?

03:01.400 --> 03:02.920
Did the patient live?

03:02.920 --> 03:05.640
           I don't know.

03:05.640 --> 03:08.840
You wouldn't believe the people
coming in and out of this hospital.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.800
Reporters, FBI, secret service -

03:11.800 --> 03:14.600
dead Endicotts are BIG news.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.080
   Let's hope it wasn't a dream.

03:17.080 --> 03:21.080
        Senator Endicott...

03:21.680 --> 03:25.680
I kept telling Douglas
his father was dead.

03:25.720 --> 03:28.160
 I kept trying to tell him but...

03:28.160 --> 03:29.920
        no words came out.

03:29.920 --> 03:32.600
Well, you made
the history books yesterday.

03:32.600 --> 03:36.600
Presidential candidate assassinated
and you pronounced it.

03:39.680 --> 03:43.680
In the dream, I was the one
who pulled the trigger.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.320
So, where are you sending me, sir?

03:49.320 --> 03:51.840
Talented doctor with surgical skills
     and a splash of OBGYN,

03:51.840 --> 03:53.480
I'm probably needed all over town.

03:53.480 --> 03:54.640
      Southside Youth Centre.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.840
Team doctor, sports medicine.
Plenty of injuries, good.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.560
No, lectures on health and hygiene
to the kids,

03:59.560 --> 04:03.560
most of them truants and drop-outs.
Oh! Well, fine, great.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.360
         Be there at noon.

04:05.360 --> 04:09.360
OK. With bells on, sir, give my
 medical insight and experience.

04:13.440 --> 04:17.440
Why didn't he stay in Africa?

04:25.520 --> 04:29.520
Excuse me...  You better not be
taking that to on call.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.840
Public CPR class.
I'm filling in for Dr Kiley.

04:31.840 --> 04:35.840
He threw his back out
kick-starting the Triumph.

04:35.920 --> 04:39.920
I want a flag on my father's casket
    whenever it is in public.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.560
   Are they moving the senator?

04:43.560 --> 04:47.040
Douglas wants the autopsy
        done at Bethesda.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.800
Keep the constituency reassured.

04:49.800 --> 04:53.640
I want us to come across
      strong and composed.

04:53.640 --> 04:57.400
Call me back in 45.
           All right.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.680
I'll need a place
     for a press conference.

04:59.680 --> 05:03.680
I'm having lawyers check liability.
Security around here is pretty lax.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.680
How's my grandmother?

05:07.680 --> 05:11.680
Stable, resting.  Good.  When do you
 plan to tell her what happened?

05:12.400 --> 05:14.320
Is she well enough to handle it?

05:14.320 --> 05:16.560
She's sleeping after
her pain medication.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.280
  I'd like her to have more time.

05:18.280 --> 05:21.800
Look, I've got arrangements to make.
 You know more about her health,

05:21.800 --> 05:25.720
so why don't you deliver the news
     when the time is right.

05:25.720 --> 05:29.240
Augusta has wit, Gordon had savvy,
but that one -

05:29.240 --> 05:32.080
 what's the opposite of charisma?

05:32.080 --> 05:34.160
How's the knee?

05:34.160 --> 05:36.800
      Well, it's OK, I guess.

05:36.800 --> 05:40.160
I started making a list
of my sexual contacts.

05:40.160 --> 05:43.680
Went back to the beginning
    just for the hell of it.

05:43.680 --> 05:47.680
Maeve Downing,
first girl I ever fell in love with.

05:49.880 --> 05:53.880
She wore pink lipstick,
chewed cinnamon gum.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.320
I started carrying her cello,
           and then...

05:57.320 --> 05:59.840
one day I kissed her and then...

05:59.840 --> 06:03.640
One day she let me put my hand
     underneath her sweater.

06:03.640 --> 06:07.280
Nothing there, but I'll never
  forget it.  Give me your fist.

06:07.280 --> 06:11.280
I love women, Jack. That's why
  I'm having this trouble now.

06:13.680 --> 06:16.920
Always was attracted to nice girls.

06:16.920 --> 06:20.400
But when I couldn't find them...

06:20.400 --> 06:24.400
I locked my wallet in the glove
 compartment in the combat zone.

06:24.920 --> 06:28.920
I always thought I'd get nailed by
a stroke, something with my heart.

06:31.440 --> 06:34.800
I've scheduled you
for treatments once a week.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.080
You know about the side effects.
I hope this stuff works.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.920
Well, it's supposed
to slow up the virus.

06:40.920 --> 06:44.000
Anti-virals are pop guns
          against AIDS.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.400
All we're doing is buying
 more sexless, sleepless nights.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.360
You tell anybody besides Westfall?

06:49.360 --> 06:53.360
Not the kind of thing you advertise.

06:54.080 --> 06:58.080
I'll be back to check on you later.

07:08.560 --> 07:12.560
This is a waste.

07:21.960 --> 07:24.840
Can I get you something?

07:24.840 --> 07:28.840
You really should rest.

07:28.960 --> 07:32.360
Mrs Endicott?

07:32.360 --> 07:35.000
Who is that?  It's Nurse Rosenthal.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.600
And you're doing fine.
Your grandson is here.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.440
I brought your grandmother's
rings back.

07:40.440 --> 07:44.440
She was concerned about having them
     removed before surgery.

07:45.160 --> 07:49.160
I can understand why.

07:57.960 --> 08:01.960
Mark... you asked me to let you know
  when Mrs Endicott was awake.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.560
Her vitals are all stable.

08:03.560 --> 08:07.280
Arterial pressure is normal.
Heart is in regular sinus rhythm.

08:07.280 --> 08:10.320
Michael is with her.
He's in pretty rough shape.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.200
Witnessed his father's murder.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.880
The FBI kept him awake all night
   asking questions.  Poor kid.

08:15.880 --> 08:19.280
Better go in. I'll tell her
  if you like.  I can handle it.

08:19.280 --> 08:22.440
As chief of services,
it's probably my task to perform.

08:22.440 --> 08:23.760
She's my patient.

08:23.760 --> 08:27.760
She's my friend.  Stay in the
background. I'll do the talking.

08:36.960 --> 08:40.960
 What happened to your hand, dear?

08:41.200 --> 08:45.120
Mrs Endicott?
Augusta, how are you feeling?

08:45.120 --> 08:46.680
        A little confused.

08:46.680 --> 08:49.160
That's natural after bypass surgery.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.400
                No.

08:51.400 --> 08:55.040
        Something's wrong.

08:55.040 --> 08:57.400
         Where's everyone?

08:57.400 --> 08:59.720
          Maggie and Jay?

08:59.720 --> 09:03.720
       Where's your father?

09:06.640 --> 09:10.640
     It's Gordon...this time.

09:13.400 --> 09:16.680
Last night...he was shot.

09:16.680 --> 09:20.680
              My son.

09:24.800 --> 09:28.800
OK, let's everybody listen up now.

09:29.920 --> 09:33.800
Squeezing and poking may give you
a good mirror splash now and then,

09:33.800 --> 09:37.800
but the best weapon against pustules
 and cysts is vigorous washing.

09:38.760 --> 09:42.400
Mount St Helens?
     No, an angry blackhead

09:42.400 --> 09:43.920
Question.

09:43.920 --> 09:47.920
My girlfriend's Catholic and won't
take the pill. What should I do?

09:48.080 --> 09:51.920
We're talking about acne,
not mortal sins. That's next week.

09:51.920 --> 09:55.920
OK. I promise not to pick my face
but I need some advice.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.960
Nobody likes
showering in a raincoat.

09:59.960 --> 10:03.960
But it beats missing prom because
 you couldn't find a babysitter.

10:04.240 --> 10:07.320
How old were you when
you lost your virginity?

10:07.320 --> 10:10.960
When one loses one's virginity
depends upon a lot of things.

10:10.960 --> 10:14.960
Emotional maturity,
sexual development, luck!

10:16.880 --> 10:20.600
    So how old were you?  Erm...
Gee, that was a long time ago.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.800
Sixteen? 17?

10:22.800 --> 10:25.200
Yeah, yeah.

10:25.200 --> 10:29.200
       Which - 16 or 17?  23.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
OK, fine. Time for your physicals.

10:39.080 --> 10:41.280
Lewis Appleton.

10:41.280 --> 10:44.120
Lewis Appleton?
Luis, Louise, Lowster?

10:44.120 --> 10:46.480
            Right here.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.080
You're in the wrong group, sonny.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.160
Elementary programme starts
  next week.  I'm 15, you dweeb.

10:51.160 --> 10:55.160
I've got a lot of future convicts
 here. I don't have time. Shoo.

10:55.200 --> 10:58.400
This is my group.
I'm 15! Will you ask anybody?

10:58.400 --> 11:02.400
OK, fine. I tried to pass myself off
in taverns when I was your age too.

11:02.640 --> 11:06.640
OK, what was the year before
  the year you were born?  1970.

11:06.960 --> 11:10.960
This way.

11:11.560 --> 11:14.520
On the scale, please.

11:14.520 --> 11:18.520
I'll take that.

11:20.280 --> 11:24.280
Eighty five pounds, 4' 1".
Small for your age.

11:24.320 --> 11:28.320
It's the way I am, OK?  Fine. Up on
the table. Your general health OK?

11:29.080 --> 11:33.080
          I can take you.

11:34.560 --> 11:38.560
The average height for a boy of 15
is 5' 5". Unless you're a Ghurkha.

11:38.920 --> 11:42.920
If you don't believe me, cut off my
arm - count the rings.  Breathe deep.

11:43.280 --> 11:47.280
Just the same, I'd like to take you
for some tests.  I hate hospitals.

11:47.600 --> 11:51.600
I just don't wanna see you playing
Little League the rest of your life.

11:51.680 --> 11:54.560
There's nothing wrong with being
short.  As long as Disney's hiring.

11:54.560 --> 11:58.560
Hey, come on, I'm just kidding.
Lewis? Lewis?

12:01.600 --> 12:04.400
What did I say?
You set Lewis off, huh?

12:04.400 --> 12:08.160
Hurt the little guy's feelings.
Hey, it doesn't take much.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.200
I sat down here to give myself
        to the community

12:11.200 --> 12:14.360
bring medicine to the masses -
       help not humiliate.

12:14.360 --> 12:18.360
Failed my responsibility. Dr
Westfall never took shots at Zulus.

12:18.440 --> 12:19.960
You're the sensitive type, huh?

12:19.960 --> 12:23.960
Tried to be. How about getting
on the scale?  How about your watch?

12:29.600 --> 12:32.320
Your minute's up, check for a pulse.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.760
Not too far up. Here.

12:34.760 --> 12:38.760
OK, no pulse. Start your breaths.

12:43.520 --> 12:47.520
OK, back to compressions.

12:47.720 --> 12:49.240
Harder.

12:49.240 --> 12:53.240
Do you know, I was surprised to see
you here?  I signed up last week.

12:54.480 --> 12:57.440
Keep your shoulders over the victim.

12:57.440 --> 13:00.600
Listen, I've been trying
to get the nerve to ask you out.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.000
I mean, after Jack's birthday.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.640
Breaths and keep going.

13:05.640 --> 13:09.640
So what do you say?  The dummy'll
die.  I don't care about Jack.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.280
OK, you just broke the guy's ribs.

13:16.280 --> 13:17.920
So is that a yes?

13:17.920 --> 13:21.920
 Yes.  Great. Stop now.  You put me
through all that to get a date?

13:22.040 --> 13:26.040
Well, now you'll have it licked
   when you do the real thing.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.720
       You're a strange guy.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.960
That's what you like about me,
         isn't it?  Yes.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.800
Class dismissed.

13:33.800 --> 13:36.520
Luther?

13:36.520 --> 13:40.480
Mrs Endicott's Bible is missing from
her room. Check the cleaning staff?

13:40.480 --> 13:43.800
The senator's clothes disappeared
        from the morgue.

13:43.800 --> 13:46.040
  Who would want bloody clothes?

13:46.040 --> 13:48.400
A government cover-up, maybe...
Of what?

13:48.400 --> 13:52.400
Who knows? Warren said the senator
didn't die. He's checking it out.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.320
Jack, remember that treatment
     we scheduled next week?

13:58.320 --> 14:01.560
Cancel it. The patient doesn't
want to continue treatment.

14:01.560 --> 14:05.560
Hey, Bob, heard you're having your
scar removed.  Changed my mind.

14:05.960 --> 14:09.960
  You want a second opinion?  No.
 I'm keeping it. It's who I am.

14:10.880 --> 14:14.160
I liked you better when you were
just a pretty face.  Lay off him.

14:14.160 --> 14:17.360
Anything you say, ma.
Wayne, he's got AIDS.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.160
Brush up on your punchlines, Boomer.

14:19.160 --> 14:22.400
I'm serious.
I've been treating him.

14:22.400 --> 14:26.400
              No way.

14:28.560 --> 14:31.440
I can't stand seeing Gran cry.

14:31.440 --> 14:34.400
You're taking the shuttle
to help Aunt Mae.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.480
No. I'm staying here with Gran.

14:36.480 --> 14:40.480
She's taken care of. I'll move her
tomorrow. We need you elsewhere.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.800
Just stop ordering me around.

14:42.800 --> 14:46.200
Sarah, will you get a hold
of yourself, please?

14:46.200 --> 14:50.200
The Limo will pick you up in an hour.

14:54.200 --> 14:58.200
Let me help you.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.360
Come on.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.560
In the emergency room...

15:03.560 --> 15:07.160
they pulled back the curtain.

15:07.160 --> 15:11.160
His chest was all open.

15:11.600 --> 15:15.600
His face was blue and he just
couldn't stop bleeding.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.520
Yes, all right.
Take it easy. There you go.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.640
All right, just breathe with it.

15:20.640 --> 15:24.640
How long have you been having
 contractions?  Every few hours.

15:26.920 --> 15:30.920
 It started last night.  Can I have
    a wheelchair? Right now.

15:31.960 --> 15:35.400
All right, just relax.
It will be all right.

15:35.400 --> 15:38.200
We're holding a press conference
            at four.

15:38.200 --> 15:42.200
You'll get your questions about Mrs
Endicott answered then. ..Come in!

15:43.200 --> 15:44.800
No, no pictures. Bye.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.280
Hi.  Hi.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.800
Busy day.

15:48.800 --> 15:52.720
Yeah, worse than the heat
during Dr Craig's transplant.

15:52.720 --> 15:56.720
Dealing with the press.  I'll come
  back later.  What do you need?

15:59.800 --> 16:01.440
Personal.

16:01.440 --> 16:05.440
It's OK, if you don't mind
   interruptions. Have a seat.

16:05.840 --> 16:09.840
You look good. How you been?
I've been terrific.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.560
Engaged?  Yeah.

16:15.560 --> 16:19.560
Comes complete with a cottage in
Marshfield and two children from his
 first marriage. Instant family.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.560
Cute kids.

16:24.560 --> 16:28.440
I love them.
We laugh, share secrets.

16:28.440 --> 16:32.440
I had a great month off.
Helped them out on Tia's farm.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.720
Cattle, horses,
wow, right there on the Chesapeake.

16:35.720 --> 16:39.280
I remember hearing you
talk about the oysters.

16:39.280 --> 16:43.280
I took my frustrations out chopping
firewood. Ran six miles a day.

16:44.160 --> 16:48.160
Damn roosters got me up
at the crack of dawn.

16:51.600 --> 16:55.440
I'd never hurt you, Joan.
I swear. You've got to believe that.

16:55.440 --> 16:59.440
I'm not holding a grudge.
 I feel the same way about you.

17:00.960 --> 17:04.960
I've got Aids.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.839
Are you sure?

17:07.839 --> 17:09.839
Yep.

17:09.839 --> 17:12.520
Oh, Bobby, I am so sorry.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.760
Me too.

17:14.760 --> 17:18.760
PHONE BUZZES
No, no calls.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.839
Is there anything I can do?

17:25.839 --> 17:28.200
Well, you should get a blood test.

17:28.200 --> 17:31.320
But I'm sure you have
no reason to worry.  Oh, my God.

17:31.320 --> 17:35.320
If the HTLB3 study shows a presence
of antibodies, get a T-cell count.

17:35.840 --> 17:39.840
Yeah.

17:40.840 --> 17:44.840
I'm sorry.

17:50.280 --> 17:54.280
I really am sorry.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.280
How's your hand?

18:12.280 --> 18:13.440
             It hurts.

18:13.440 --> 18:16.840
You want me to look at it?  It's OK.

18:16.840 --> 18:20.840
Listen, I'm sorry about breaking
the glass. I'll send you a cheque.

18:21.840 --> 18:25.800
I've done things like that too,
you know. I broke a telephone once.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.280
Aren't you going to offer
your condolences?

18:28.280 --> 18:32.280
Some guy I've never even seen before
said he felt he'd lost a good friend.

18:33.560 --> 18:37.560
A lot of people admired
your father, you know.  Yeah.

18:37.760 --> 18:39.480
     Well, I got my test back.

18:39.480 --> 18:43.480
Dr Chandler says I've got
the family curse. Haemochromatosis.

18:44.440 --> 18:47.240
They drain off a pint of blood
each week.

18:47.240 --> 18:50.880
Phlebotomy will bring your
iron levels back to normal.

18:50.880 --> 18:54.000
Open up the veins
and let out all the evil spirits.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
          Blood-letting.

18:58.240 --> 19:01.480
        Like the Dark Ages.

19:01.480 --> 19:04.160
I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it?

19:04.160 --> 19:06.600
You fall into the thorns, you bleed.

19:06.600 --> 19:10.600
 That's what people want from us.

19:15.680 --> 19:19.680
I stood there and watched my father
get blown away.

19:20.040 --> 19:22.120
         I heard him die.

19:22.120 --> 19:26.120
   I was standing in his blood.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.960
             Damn it!

19:41.160 --> 19:45.160
I don't want any more of this family.
It's time to hit the silk. I am gone!

19:58.440 --> 19:59.840
Who's there?

19:59.840 --> 20:01.080
          Is Lewis home?

20:01.080 --> 20:05.080
Who wants to know?  The doctor from
the Southside Youth Centre.

20:09.200 --> 20:13.200
I'm his father. What's the problem?

20:23.520 --> 20:27.520
Donald told me about the diagnosis.
It's a damn tough break.

20:28.920 --> 20:32.920
Stiff upper lip, right?

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
What's this I hear about you
staying?  Gonna work till I can't.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.360
Are you out of your mind?

20:40.360 --> 20:42.760
Have you had your teeth
         cleaned lately?

20:42.760 --> 20:46.760
Dentists wear masks and gloves.
Nobody's fooling with this thing.

20:46.920 --> 20:49.480
What am I supposed to do? Walk away?

20:49.480 --> 20:53.480
Everybody you touch has to be told.
My medical status is confidential.

20:54.040 --> 20:56.160
In this place? Are you kidding?

20:56.160 --> 20:58.120
When the word gets out,

20:58.120 --> 21:02.120
we'll be able to fire a cannon down
the hall without hitting a patient.

21:02.160 --> 21:06.160
Bobby, I don't take any pleasure
asking you to leave.

21:06.160 --> 21:10.160
I brought you up here from Duke
myself but for crying out loud...

21:10.520 --> 21:14.000
What's it been? Two years?

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
It doesn't make any difference.
You're out.  Understand something.

21:20.080 --> 21:24.080
I'm the one who will decide when
it's time to leave this hospital.

21:24.120 --> 21:28.120
Not you.

21:33.160 --> 21:37.160
I sent Lewis to the bakery. He
didn't seem sick.  Ah, thank you.

21:37.880 --> 21:41.880
His health is fine, but I'm concerned
about his height, or lack of it.

21:43.080 --> 21:47.080
 He's not growing normally.  Lewis
 isn't like us. He's just short.

21:47.680 --> 21:51.240
We may not be talking genetics here.
There's different kinds of dwarfism.

21:51.240 --> 21:54.680
Condraplastic, mesomelic, renal,
pituitary.

21:54.680 --> 21:58.680
The beat goes on. Some conditions
are treatable, some aren't.

21:58.960 --> 22:01.120
I'd like to see
what we're up against.

22:01.120 --> 22:05.120
Look, we took Lewis to a doctor. He
said to let nature take its course.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.840
Yeah, and he charged us 200 bucks.

22:08.840 --> 22:11.480
Did the guy take X-rays, blood tests?

22:11.480 --> 22:13.680
He should have taken us to dinner!

22:13.680 --> 22:15.560
Doctor, when I was a kid,

22:15.560 --> 22:18.600
my parents dragged me
  to all sorts of specialists.

22:18.600 --> 22:22.120
They ran electricity
through my bones.

22:22.120 --> 22:25.760
They put me in traction.
They even tried to stretch my legs.

22:25.760 --> 22:29.760
They did everything except
wave a magic wand over Verne.

22:29.800 --> 22:32.640
We do not want to put our son
through torture.

22:32.640 --> 22:36.280
Build his hopes up, just to
have them knocked down? No thanks.

22:36.280 --> 22:40.280
The best thing we can do for Lewis
is help him accept who he is.

22:40.440 --> 22:44.440
Sage parental counselling. But if we
can correct the problem...  Problem?

22:45.280 --> 22:49.280
To you, it's a problem. To us, it's
how we are.  Yes, we are different.

22:50.080 --> 22:54.080
Not handicapped.  What is in it
 for you? Are you on commission?

22:54.560 --> 22:58.560
I know what it's like to be set
apart - cast adrift by one's peers.

22:58.600 --> 23:01.680
I towered over everyone
in third grade.

23:01.680 --> 23:05.120
The humiliation, the name-calling...
All right! All right!

23:05.120 --> 23:07.200
We'll think it over.

23:07.200 --> 23:11.200
Thanks for listening. Well, I
hate to sip and run, but duty calls.

23:11.240 --> 23:12.800
        Leonardo da Vinci.

23:12.800 --> 23:16.800
It's a reproduction.

23:26.120 --> 23:29.160
Mrs Endicott, I'm Dr Chandler.

23:29.160 --> 23:32.400
I thought you'd like to know
  your granddaughter had a son.

23:32.400 --> 23:36.080
Are they all right?  Yes. The baby
 was early, but everyone's fine.

23:36.080 --> 23:38.680
Good news. Thank God.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.840
When can I see them?

23:40.840 --> 23:42.000
She's in recovery.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.960
Who?

23:43.960 --> 23:47.360
Sarah...just had her baby.

23:47.360 --> 23:51.360
Why wasn't I notified?
She had an emergency C-section.

23:51.880 --> 23:55.880
The family should have been
       consulted.  Douglas.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.600
All right, Phil,

23:58.600 --> 24:02.600
Would you call our press secretary.
He'll want to get a release out.

24:05.880 --> 24:07.720
Yeah.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.920
Sarah and her little boy are fine.

24:09.920 --> 24:13.880
It's not like I'm promiscuous
or a drug user.

24:13.880 --> 24:16.080
       I don't deserve this.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.880
We are dealing with an
infectious disease,

24:18.880 --> 24:21.960
not punishment
     for moral backsliding.

24:21.960 --> 24:25.120
I'll have the results for you
         in the morning.

24:25.120 --> 24:27.680
And I'm supposed to sleep tonight?

24:27.680 --> 24:31.680
Joan, did you speak to lawyers about
liability in the senator's death?

24:31.720 --> 24:34.680
Not yet.
When you have a moment then.  Yeah.

24:34.680 --> 24:38.680
Getting a marriage licence already?
No, I'm having a few tests done.

24:39.680 --> 24:42.880
I saw young Peter here
         the other day.

24:42.880 --> 24:46.880
Had on a cap much like
the one I used to wear. Earflaps.

24:50.640 --> 24:53.200
Even if you were exposed
          to the virus,

24:53.200 --> 24:57.200
the chances are pretty good
that you won't develop the disease.

24:57.440 --> 25:00.040
How long before I'd show symptoms?

25:00.040 --> 25:04.040
Why don't we wait for the results?
Stop being calm and supportive!

25:04.680 --> 25:07.640
I want to know what I'm up against.

25:07.640 --> 25:11.640
The incubation period can be
anywhere from one to five years.

25:12.360 --> 25:16.360
         And then you die?

25:21.400 --> 25:24.760
What a day.  You're not kidding.
This place has been a zoo.

25:24.760 --> 25:27.320
Aftermath of a tragedy. Cake walk!

25:27.320 --> 25:31.320
I was ridiculed by hoodlums, watch
got stolen, angered an elfin family.

25:39.080 --> 25:43.080
What the hell are you doing?

25:44.120 --> 25:48.120
Listen, I got twenties.  What's in
   the bag?  Hey, no harm done!

25:48.880 --> 25:51.920
Mrs Endicott's Bible.

25:51.920 --> 25:55.920
That's a piece of history.  Get out
of here.  All right, take it easy.

25:56.160 --> 26:00.160
Get out of here!  I'm a collector.
Get out of here, sicko!

26:04.280 --> 26:08.280
RAPS ON DOOR
Hey.

26:11.280 --> 26:14.320
Curare? Heavy class three.
Death in a bottle.

26:14.320 --> 26:18.160
Got enough to take out 8-10 enemies.
What you going to do with all this?

26:18.160 --> 26:22.160
Patient's got a headache.
Want to cure it for good?

26:29.840 --> 26:33.120
I couldn't get him to nurse
            at first.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.520
I kept putting the nipple
          in his mouth.

26:35.520 --> 26:38.360
He'd push it out
and we'd start again.

26:38.360 --> 26:42.360
My youngest wouldn't get near me.
Yours has the right idea.

26:44.240 --> 26:46.560
I'll be right back.

26:46.560 --> 26:50.560
                Hi.

26:51.480 --> 26:53.720
   He's an Endicott, all right.

26:53.720 --> 26:57.440
  Noble brow and patrician nose.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.960
           Sarah, um...

26:59.960 --> 27:03.960
What I said about your baby being
more fodder for the family curse...

27:05.280 --> 27:09.280
            I'm sorry.

27:10.320 --> 27:14.320
 I got you this downstairs.  Cute.
She's got a little baby too.

27:19.240 --> 27:21.120
  Take care.  Where are you going?

27:21.120 --> 27:23.680
I'll let you know when I get there.

27:23.680 --> 27:27.240
Somewhere...New Jersey.
It doesn't matter.

27:27.240 --> 27:30.040
Will you tell Gran?

27:30.040 --> 27:34.040
             Not yet.

27:37.520 --> 27:39.360
             Hey, you,

27:39.360 --> 27:41.560
        with the long life.

27:41.560 --> 27:45.560
          And loud music.

27:47.920 --> 27:51.920
Bye, Michael.

28:04.320 --> 28:08.320
Wayne, what's the green stuff in
your tub?  It was here when I moved.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.640
Next birthday,
you're getting a cleaning lady(!)

28:11.640 --> 28:15.640
She's going to want hazard pay.
Candlelight. Soft music.

28:15.680 --> 28:19.680
This is a first-class seduction.

28:20.200 --> 28:23.320
You don't have to look away.
I'm about to get into bed.

28:23.320 --> 28:27.320
I'm trying to rediscover romance.
       I like a surprise.

28:32.800 --> 28:35.520
Bodies are a variation on a theme.

28:35.520 --> 28:37.240
Your variation is warm!

28:37.240 --> 28:39.280
Your feet are cold!

28:39.280 --> 28:43.080
I was starting to think this
was never going to happen.

28:43.080 --> 28:47.080
You had the heat for whatshername.
What about you and Boomer?

28:50.440 --> 28:54.440
At his birthday party I started
thinking that we ought to give it
another try but it wouldn't work.

28:56.880 --> 28:59.480
Boomer's like a brother. Anyway,
          here we are.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.400
On the threshold of a great time!

29:01.400 --> 29:04.760
I couldn't be happier.
I really have fun with you.

29:04.760 --> 29:08.760
But will you respect me
  in the morning?  That depends.

30:34.160 --> 30:38.160
       I'm better off dead.

30:46.240 --> 30:49.280
Bobby, are you in there?
KNOCK AT DOOR

30:49.280 --> 30:52.760
              Bobby.

30:52.760 --> 30:56.760
KNOCKING

31:01.200 --> 31:03.840
         Anybody in there?

31:03.840 --> 31:07.840
              Bobby!

31:09.200 --> 31:13.000
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
Cynthia, what's the problem?

31:13.000 --> 31:16.480
I didn't mean to.
You have to help me.  It's OK.

31:16.480 --> 31:19.880
  I was gonna take a bath and...

31:19.880 --> 31:23.880
Take it easy.  I started the tub
and my friend called and I forgot

31:25.320 --> 31:28.800
and now there's water everywhere.
I know.

31:28.800 --> 31:32.640
It got in your place to? I'm sorry.
I'll pay you back, I promise.

31:32.640 --> 31:35.040
Hey, it was an accident.

31:35.040 --> 31:39.040
They'll kill me! I told them I was
old enough and I didn't need a sitter
and they'll never trust me again.

31:40.880 --> 31:44.440
They don't have to know.
 We'll clean up.  You'll help me?

31:44.440 --> 31:47.720
Sure. Just let me get a mop.
Thank you.  Hold it.

31:47.720 --> 31:51.720
I'm coming down with a cold.
Don't want you to catch anything.

31:52.440 --> 31:56.440
No more tears, OK?

32:00.720 --> 32:04.480
Have you had a blood test for Aids?

32:04.480 --> 32:08.480
What?!  I decided to get myself
          tested today.

32:10.560 --> 32:14.160
Do you think you have Aids?
No. I don't know.

32:14.160 --> 32:16.520
I don't know if I want to know.

32:16.520 --> 32:18.200
Then why did you have the test?

32:18.200 --> 32:22.000
Paranoid. Someone in the hospital
        has the disease.

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
A friend of mine. Straight.  Where do
you think you could have got it?

32:26.920 --> 32:30.920
They say people are at risk as
far back as '77. I was in college.

32:31.320 --> 32:33.040
I was learning to make a paste.

32:33.040 --> 32:37.040
VD was no big deal. They were
handing out penicillin like it was
 candy at the University Clinic.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.160
People I'm in college with
are more interested in law school.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.680
Free love was our birthright.

32:43.680 --> 32:47.680
Nobody ever told us
there would be a price.

32:51.240 --> 32:55.240
  Douglas, please stopped pacing.

32:56.560 --> 33:00.560
Mrs Endicott, what is this about
leaving? I never OK'd a transfer.

33:01.360 --> 33:05.240
I'm concerned about her  security
and I would feel more comfortable...

33:05.240 --> 33:09.240
Your comfort doesn't concern me.
        Her safety does.

33:10.520 --> 33:14.520
Your condition is stable, but the
next few days is a critical period.

33:14.760 --> 33:18.760
We've a hospital suite at the
compound.  Gran, I must talk to you.

33:20.080 --> 33:21.640
    Michael, what do you think?

33:21.640 --> 33:25.640
Should I stay here at St Eligius
or recuperate in the Cape?

33:25.840 --> 33:29.840
Up to you.  You have everything
 you need here.  Except salt air.

33:32.920 --> 33:35.160
   I do miss my blue water view.

33:35.160 --> 33:39.160
I wonder if you'd see to the
arrangements for me, Dr Craig.

33:39.920 --> 33:43.920
Against medical advice and over
my strong objection.  Duly noted.

33:45.640 --> 33:49.640
You should listen to your doctors
and not pretenders to the throne.

33:53.920 --> 33:57.920
You think you could manage a clean
lacrosse jersey for Dad's funeral?

33:59.000 --> 34:03.000
Douglas, will you stop?! You've done
nothing but give orders.

34:04.560 --> 34:08.560
Well, somebody has to keep this
family together because, God knows,
 it's coming apart at the seams.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.719
  Brow-beating is not leadership.

34:12.719 --> 34:16.600
People look to the Endicotts
to encourage and inspire.

34:16.600 --> 34:20.600
We've won trust and respect, not
seized it through self-importance.

34:21.400 --> 34:24.480
What more do you want from me?

34:24.480 --> 34:28.480
My father died, too.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.679
You shouldn't be so hard on him.

34:34.679 --> 34:36.880
 Even when you were a small child,

34:36.880 --> 34:39.560
your grandfather recognised
your compassion.

34:39.560 --> 34:43.560
Grandma...I came to say goodbye.

34:45.040 --> 34:49.040
              I see.

34:49.159 --> 34:51.719
If you leave, you have my blessing,

34:51.719 --> 34:55.440
but know one thing
about being an Endicott -

34:55.440 --> 34:59.440
you bring the burden and the gift
of your legacy into every situation.

35:03.160 --> 35:07.160
     It can't be left behind.

35:19.880 --> 35:22.800
Hop on up there. Give me that robe.

35:22.800 --> 35:25.320
Sorry. No hard feelings, I hope.

35:25.320 --> 35:28.640
I didn't like yesterday
and you have not improved with age,

35:28.640 --> 35:31.920
so can the chat
and cut to the chase.

35:31.920 --> 35:35.400
How long before I get a crack
at Miss 55?

35:35.400 --> 35:38.080
Assuming you're a candidate
      for growth hormones,

35:38.080 --> 35:40.000
have the injections three times
     a week for nine months.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.840
Wait three months,
    then continue the shots.

35:43.840 --> 35:46.760
Hey! Wait until I'm in the shelter.

35:46.760 --> 35:50.760
Hey, am I going to grow all over?
My hands, my feet, my, er...?

35:50.760 --> 35:54.760
Lewis, we're not breeding bulls.
           ..Go ahead.

36:13.760 --> 36:17.200
Tim, you got the test results on...

36:17.200 --> 36:19.760
patient 135720?

36:19.760 --> 36:22.760
135720...

36:22.760 --> 36:25.280
Who's the blonde?

36:25.280 --> 36:26.760
Joan Haloran.

36:26.760 --> 36:30.200
Ice Maiden of hospital services?!

36:30.200 --> 36:32.120
Hey, Joan.

36:32.120 --> 36:36.120
Tim Treadway. Guy who sends you the
hate mail about the busted counter.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
Joan, are we getting a new one,
during this millennium maybe?
We're a little backed up right now.

36:42.720 --> 36:46.720
Oh, you're backed up. So I have
to pipette my own blood samples,

36:47.920 --> 36:51.320
find a microscope and go blind
    counting platelets.  Tim!

36:51.320 --> 36:55.320
What do you call 500 bureaucrats
at the bottom of a river? A start.

36:55.560 --> 36:59.560
Here. HDLV3 antibody assay.
      I need the bathroom.

37:11.240 --> 37:15.240
Clean as a whistle.

37:16.760 --> 37:20.760
I'm only going along with this cos
you insisted.  What's the big deal?

37:21.640 --> 37:24.600
I don't want Lewis
to be an experiment.

37:24.600 --> 37:28.280
I've got bad news. Lewis can't wear
your hand-me-downs, Mr Appleton.

37:28.280 --> 37:32.280
The X-rays are normal. We can
start him on growth hormones ASAP.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
I'm so happy for you, dear.
Yeah, I won't be a shrimp any more.

37:46.160 --> 37:49.960
Mr Appleton?  Did you hear that?
Shrimp!

37:49.960 --> 37:52.400
That's what he'll call his old man.

37:52.400 --> 37:56.400
You want what's best for your son?
Of course I do!  What's the problem?

37:56.480 --> 37:59.600
Lewis is starting to talk
about girls lately.

37:59.600 --> 38:03.600
Do you think he'll bring them home to
meet us?  You're family.
I don't see what's going to change.

38:04.480 --> 38:08.480
When I was a boy there was a kid
on my street whose parents were
from Italy and they had an accent.

38:10.760 --> 38:12.480
      He was ashamed of them.

38:12.480 --> 38:16.480
When his mother called him, it was
like he didn't know who they were.

38:16.520 --> 38:19.680
Wait a second.

38:19.680 --> 38:21.720
Lewis, come here!

38:21.720 --> 38:25.720
Come down here.

38:27.800 --> 38:31.800
OK. Now this is where
   he's going to be by summer.

38:32.200 --> 38:34.280
Here by graduation.

38:34.280 --> 38:38.280
What's the difference?
I'll always look up to you, Dad.

38:42.120 --> 38:46.120
KNOCK AT DOOR

38:46.600 --> 38:48.640
       Came to say goodbye.

38:48.640 --> 38:52.640
Sorry to run out
  at such short notice, Donald.

38:52.760 --> 38:55.920
  Where you heading?  California.

38:55.920 --> 38:59.680
Gonna work part-time
in an Aids hospice.

38:59.680 --> 39:01.440
Spend the rest of the day reading -

39:01.440 --> 39:05.320
Shakespeare, history,
all the great novels.

39:05.320 --> 39:09.320
Everything I didn't have time for
   cos I was studying science.

39:15.280 --> 39:18.200
Single malt. It's good stuff. On me.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.720
            Thank you.

39:20.720 --> 39:24.720
I almost saved myself the trouble
of packing last night, Donald.

39:25.760 --> 39:29.680
50cc of curare
 and half a litre of IV saline.

39:29.680 --> 39:31.960
Swift and painless.

39:31.960 --> 39:35.480
Yet we spend most of our lives
wondering how we're going to die,

39:35.480 --> 39:39.480
when, why... So instead of waiting
for the end, we keep moving.

39:44.640 --> 39:46.280
Guess maybe I'm lucky.

39:46.280 --> 39:47.960
I already know when.

39:47.960 --> 39:51.680
Makes living easier.

39:51.680 --> 39:55.680
I've only got so much time left.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.600
Free to put my house in order.

39:58.600 --> 40:02.600
Bye, Donald.  Good luck.

40:14.640 --> 40:18.640
Grams.  You didn't miss out on
labour. I was 30 hours having your
  father.  How are you feeling?

40:20.880 --> 40:23.880
Oh! My age.

40:23.880 --> 40:26.320
Doug's on his was to Washington.

40:26.320 --> 40:28.680
You and I will miss the funeral.

40:28.680 --> 40:31.240
Mrs Endicott, could I get a picture?

40:31.240 --> 40:35.240
Luther, please!
Daniel, it's all right.

40:40.440 --> 40:44.440
OK, just one more like this.  Enough,
  Luther.  Thank you.  Thank you.

40:48.760 --> 40:52.080
Here comes your first
        great-grandchild.

40:52.080 --> 40:54.720
Oh, let's see this child of urgency.

40:54.720 --> 40:58.720
       There you go.  Oh! Oh!

41:01.240 --> 41:05.240
Gordon Franklin Endicott Preston.
Four names is a bit much.

41:10.480 --> 41:14.480
There's no greater grief for
a woman than the loss of a child.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.680
I've lost three.

41:18.680 --> 41:22.680
Three babies...that raised me
    more than I raised them.

41:24.520 --> 41:28.520
It's so wrong to have outlived them.

41:28.800 --> 41:32.800
God seems to pin me
    between hope and despair.

41:37.280 --> 41:39.840
Let this child...

41:39.840 --> 41:43.840
be the legacy of hope.

41:44.440 --> 43:42.000
And drop one of his names.
