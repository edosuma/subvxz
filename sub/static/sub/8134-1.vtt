00:00.134 --> 00:03.602
â™ªâ™ª

00:12.613 --> 00:14.079
[indistinct chatter]

01:40.534 --> 01:42.634
Hey, can you watch
where you're going?

01:46.474 --> 01:47.940
You can see me?

02:06.260 --> 02:07.726
You got this.

02:15.169 --> 02:16.535
[sighs]

02:26.180 --> 02:27.746
Hi.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.017
I'm Clary Fray.

02:40.995 --> 02:44.696
This landscape is very...
decorative.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.766
Well, I wasn't really going
for decorative, exactly.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.302
What are those?
Oh, those.
Nothing, just, um...

02:50.304 --> 02:55.274
[stammers] some ideas
for a graphic novel
I'm drawing with a friend.

02:55.276 --> 02:58.844
Really, it's just there
by mistake.

02:58.846 --> 03:02.014
The Brooklyn Academy of Art
doesn't believe in mistakes.

03:07.121 --> 03:11.156
Give me
the professors' names
and I... I will end them.

03:11.158 --> 03:13.158
You know, with...
with a scathing e-mail
to the dean.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.793
Don't bother.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.432
[Simon] What?

03:21.835 --> 03:24.236
Sad face? Really?
[Clary laughs]

03:24.238 --> 03:26.505
Well played, well played.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.574
Thank you.
You know, it's weird.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.242
They kind of liked
my assigned work,

03:30.244 --> 03:33.078
but they flipped out
over the drawings
for our graphic novel.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.347
You're welcome. [chuckles]
This day will go down
in history

03:35.349 --> 03:37.316
as the greatest
18th birthday I ever had.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.518
Which is why we are
celebrating tonight.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.253
Yes, with Maureen,
after our show.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.354
Absolutely.

03:42.356 --> 03:45.324
So... what's the deal
with you and Maureen?

03:45.326 --> 03:48.860
What deal? No deal.
We sing together.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.663
You seriously don't know
she's been crushing on you
this whole time?

03:51.665 --> 03:53.232
[stammering]
What? No. No.

03:53.234 --> 03:56.101
Simon, how can
someone as smart
and perceptive as you

03:56.103 --> 04:00.505
not realize that the person
sitting right there
is in love with you?

04:00.507 --> 04:02.274
I guarantee you I'm
not the only smart,

04:02.276 --> 04:04.343
perceptive person
to make that mistake.

04:09.850 --> 04:10.749
That's a latte.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.217
But I could have sworn
I had a biscotti.

04:12.219 --> 04:14.219
Maybe you ate it really fast
and didn't even notice.

04:14.221 --> 04:17.122
Happens to me all the time.
When I'm happy...
when I'm sad.

04:17.124 --> 04:19.391
[Clary laughs]
But I will replace
your mythical biscotti

04:19.393 --> 04:20.292
with an actual one.
Thank you.

04:20.294 --> 04:22.427
You know what?
Here's to you.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.329
<i> L'chaim.</i>
<i> L'chaim.</i> [chuckles]

04:31.272 --> 04:32.838
[horn blaring]

04:37.645 --> 04:39.711
[dog barking]
[Luke] Same MO
as the others?

04:39.713 --> 04:42.047
Yeah, this one's
drained of blood.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.020
[whimpers]

04:49.590 --> 04:51.390
This makes seven.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.492
Yeah, not good.

04:57.331 --> 04:58.497
[Luke] Hey, Captain Vargas.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.498
Another body
drained of blood?

04:59.500 --> 05:01.300
We're thinking
formalin pump.

05:01.302 --> 05:03.535
Alaric and I
are chasing down
a bunch of leads.

05:04.271 --> 05:07.139
[cell phone ringing]

05:07.141 --> 05:09.408
You know she can tell
when you decline a call,
right?

05:09.410 --> 05:11.443
Yep.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.944
I need you to do
something for me.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.279
What? Catch these guys?

05:14.281 --> 05:15.314
Besides that.

05:15.316 --> 05:18.250
Marry Jocelyn.
What are you waiting for?

05:18.252 --> 05:19.985
Me and Jocelyn, we're...

05:19.987 --> 05:22.054
we're different.
[cell phone ringing]

05:24.091 --> 05:25.991
It's for Clary's birthday.
[phone beeps]

05:25.993 --> 05:29.061
You're already
acting like a husband,
go be one.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.275
Hey, Dot.
Hey!

05:43.277 --> 05:44.343
How's your future looking?

05:44.345 --> 05:46.111
Not as good as yours.
Hmm.

05:46.113 --> 05:49.014
The tarot cards tell me
you got into
the advanced program.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.117
And by "the tarot cards,"
you mean,
"Simon's Twitter account"?

05:52.119 --> 05:54.353
[chuckles] Okay,
I follow him.
Mmm.

05:54.355 --> 05:57.389
Turns out, predicting
the future with tarot cards
is very complicated.

05:57.391 --> 06:01.393
But, I do see
a birthday present
in your future.

06:01.395 --> 06:04.262
Dot!
[chuckles] Okay, open it!

06:04.264 --> 06:05.564
Wow!

06:05.566 --> 06:06.998
Yeah, you might want
to keep that on the DL,

06:07.000 --> 06:08.700
'cause your mom's my boss
and I don't want her
to flip out.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.503
Yeah, but that's
how I know it's cool.
[both chuckle]

06:11.505 --> 06:12.971
You know, you're way
better at gift-giving

06:12.973 --> 06:14.740
than magically
predicting the future.

06:14.742 --> 06:17.943
Nothing magical about it.
I just buy the things
I wanna wear.

06:19.346 --> 06:20.846
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.647
I love you, Clary.

06:22.649 --> 06:24.950
I love you, too.
[sighs deeply]

06:25.552 --> 06:26.618
You okay?

06:28.021 --> 06:30.489
Yeah. [chuckles]
Yeah, happy birthday.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.458
Go up and see your mom.

06:44.071 --> 06:47.272
Mom!
You did it! Yay!
[laughs]

06:47.274 --> 06:49.341
You also follow Simon?

06:49.343 --> 06:50.542
He only has 92 followers.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.511
He needs the retweets.
Congratulations.
[chuckles]

06:52.513 --> 06:55.447
Thank you.
Hashtag, stalker mom.

06:56.417 --> 06:57.816
Happy birthday.

07:04.324 --> 07:05.624
It's called a stele.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.526
What is it,
like, a paperweight?

07:07.528 --> 07:09.494
No, it's much more
than that.

07:10.431 --> 07:11.563
It's very ancient.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.765
I want you to have it.

07:13.767 --> 07:17.936
It's a family heirloom.
[chuckles] We Frays
have heirlooms?

07:17.938 --> 07:19.438
A few.
You know, it's weird.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.641
I doodled something
that looked like this
this morning.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.476
I must have seen this
around the house somewhere.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.344
Honey, I need to--
[cell phone chimes]

07:27.147 --> 07:28.713
Simon.
He's on his way over.

07:28.715 --> 07:30.382
But we need to talk.
I can't right now.
I gotta change.

07:30.384 --> 07:32.651
I'm going to see
Champagne Enema tonight.
What?

07:32.653 --> 07:34.152
Yeah, I know.
It's the new band name.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.654
But Simon and Maureen
are taking me out after.

07:35.656 --> 07:39.825
But it's...
It's your 18th birthday,
and, uh...

07:39.827 --> 07:41.092
[inhales deeply]

07:41.094 --> 07:42.761
everything's gonna
change for you now.

07:42.763 --> 07:45.163
Mom, we've had the talk.
I'm good.

07:45.165 --> 07:49.534
We need to have
a much different
and more important talk.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.102
And we will.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.839
But can it be
over breakfast, all right?

07:53.841 --> 07:55.207
I love you.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.676
Thank you for the heirloom.

07:57.678 --> 07:58.710
I love you.

07:59.646 --> 08:00.745
[exhales]

08:09.656 --> 08:10.489
[sighs]

08:33.647 --> 08:35.614
Your daughter
looks just like you.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.182
It's the hair.

08:38.552 --> 08:39.684
[croaks]

08:44.658 --> 08:46.024
[roaring]

08:53.700 --> 08:55.700
[panting]

08:56.670 --> 08:58.703
[growls]
[Jocelyn yells]

09:01.975 --> 09:03.241
[gasps]

09:06.380 --> 09:08.046
Come on.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.749
Magnus!

09:12.519 --> 09:14.986
Please, Magnus,
only a warlock can do this.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.054
Mom?

09:16.056 --> 09:17.155
It's okay, honey.
It's for the best.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.691
You're not protecting her,
you're deceiving her.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.493
For as long as possible.

09:21.495 --> 09:23.695
She won't be
a child forever, Jocelyn.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.398
For now, I don't want her
part of our world.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.333
Mom, I don't wanna
do this.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.769
Please, take her memories.

09:42.015 --> 09:45.383
Hey, sorry I'm late.
Captain's got me on
those demonic murders.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.786
Look at the drawings.
[sighs]

09:48.855 --> 09:50.722
It's already happening.

09:50.724 --> 09:53.191
We both knew
this time was coming.
We'll tell her together.

09:53.193 --> 09:56.294
No, it was my choice.
I'll do it alone.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.929
All right.
Well, do it soon.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.398
And if she's unprepared,
your life is in danger.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.466
And so is Clary's.

10:01.468 --> 10:03.068
Hey, Luke, what's up?
Hey!

10:03.070 --> 10:04.736
Incredible drawings.
Oh, thanks.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.037
And I got you these.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.474
Spray paint.
Oh, they're perfect.

10:09.476 --> 10:12.377
If I catch any of that paint
on city walls,
I will arrest you.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.712
The paint is
for Simon's van.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.814
I'm insisting
they rename the band.
Oh, yes, please.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.650
[Clary] Yeah.
Did your mom talk
to you about that?

10:18.652 --> 10:20.752
The heirloom.
Yeah, it's beautiful.

10:20.754 --> 10:23.588
Clary, you're 18 now, and--
What is with you guys?

10:23.590 --> 10:26.491
I'm turning 18,
it's not like I'm headed
off on some epic journey.

10:26.493 --> 10:27.592
[Simon] But you are!

10:27.594 --> 10:28.960
See, we are going
to Lombardi's

10:28.962 --> 10:30.629
to celebrate your
birthday after our gig.
[chuckles]

10:30.631 --> 10:33.765
You should come
back here after.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.734
The city's not
that safe right now.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.902
Ah, thanks, Mom,
but we're set.

10:37.904 --> 10:39.771
Yeah, we will take
a rain check.

10:39.773 --> 10:42.240
Wait. Do I smell
chicken cacciatore?

10:42.242 --> 10:43.808
Simon, your gig.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.644
Oh, you're singing?
Yes, big gig.

10:45.646 --> 10:48.179
And by big,
I mean not so.
[chuckles]

10:48.982 --> 10:50.515
[chokes] Losing
circulation here.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.684
Breakfast,
you and me, tomorrow.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.352
Promise?
Yep.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.755
[Clary] Mom... uh, Mom?

10:56.757 --> 11:00.959
Mom, you have to let me go.
I'm biologically
and legally an adult.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.027
Yeah.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.396
That's what I'm afraid of.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.732
Shall we?
Yes.

11:09.002 --> 11:12.937
Just let her be a kid
for one last day.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.173
Okay.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.675
[Clary] <i> My mom is</i>
<i> so overprotective lately.</i>

11:16.677 --> 11:18.276
[chuckles]
So, do you
remember in <i> Aliens,</i>

11:18.278 --> 11:20.045
when the alien queen
was defending her eggs
from Ripley?

11:20.047 --> 11:23.648
In this scenario,
is my mom Ripley
or the alien queen?

11:23.650 --> 11:24.883
Both.
What?

11:24.885 --> 11:26.618
A mother
defending her young.

11:26.620 --> 11:28.353
Defending me from what?

11:28.355 --> 11:29.854
I spend all day
in an art studio.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.723
My life couldn't be
more mundane.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.892
Besides,
I really don't know much
about when she was young.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.227
Oh, just do what I do
and get all the dirt
from your relatives.

11:36.229 --> 11:39.664
[scoffs] Well,
I would if I could,
but she doesn't have any.

11:39.666 --> 11:41.666
And my... my dad died
before I was born.

11:41.668 --> 11:43.034
So, you have no one?

11:43.036 --> 11:46.304
No uncles, no aunts,
no third cousins,
twice removed?

11:46.306 --> 11:47.906
No, just me and my mom.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.575
It's why the Lewis clan
has added three chairs
to every seder

11:50.577 --> 11:51.910
since pre-school.
Mmm.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.045
One for Clary,
one for Jocelyn,
and one for Elijah.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.247
Of course.
Obviously.
Yes, obviously.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.149
You guys don't think
that's a little bit
suspicious?

11:58.151 --> 11:59.984
You not knowing
anything about your family?

11:59.986 --> 12:02.887
Your mom could be hiding
some deep, dark secret.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.856
Maureen, it's not possible.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.157
No, no, think about it.
No, seriously.

12:06.159 --> 12:09.394
My mother is incapable
of concealing
anything from me.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.808
[Alec] Isabelle, let's go.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.852
Hey, there, big bro.

12:33.854 --> 12:34.753
Really?

12:34.755 --> 12:38.690
What can I say?
Demons dig blondes.

12:38.692 --> 12:40.925
Of course they do,
but that's white.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.427
Platinum.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.362
And they don't exactly
like Shakespeare,
okay, Alec?

12:44.364 --> 12:45.964
You're plenty distracting
on your own.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.767
[sighs] So, be yourself.
Is that what
you're trying to say?

12:48.769 --> 12:51.369
Never mind.
Looking good, let's go.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.738
We're ready, Jace.

12:53.740 --> 12:56.274
Nice choice, Izzy.
Demons dig blondes.
[Isabelle] Told you.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.475
[Alec] It's platinum.

12:57.477 --> 12:58.643
All right, guys,
for some reason

12:58.645 --> 13:00.078
our demon friends
are killing mundanes

13:00.080 --> 13:01.780
and draining their blood.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.949
Why do they want blood?
Isn't that vampire territory?

13:04.951 --> 13:05.850
I don't know, Alec.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.470
Lazy vampires, maybe?

13:08.471 --> 13:09.988
[sighs] There must be
something special
about their blood.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.990
What could be special
about mundane blood?

13:11.992 --> 13:16.161
You get me a sample
and I'll tell you exactly
what they're looking for.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.762
We'll have more answers

13:17.764 --> 13:19.497
when we figure out
exactly who the demons
are working for.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.666
So, you don't think
they're acting on their own?

13:21.668 --> 13:23.735
No.

13:23.736 --> 13:25.803
They're not exactly
creative thinkers,
they're shapeshifters.

13:27.774 --> 13:29.874
This is what
our target looks like.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.977
[Isabelle] For now.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.079
Great.
I'll get approval
for the mission.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.514
Come on, Alec.

13:36.516 --> 13:37.816
By the time you've
sent that message,

13:37.818 --> 13:39.851
we'll have killed
six demons.

13:39.853 --> 13:43.988
Besides, it's more fun
to break the rules
than to follow them.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.157
<i> â™ª Forever young â™ª</i>

13:46.159 --> 13:50.461
<i> â™ª I wanna be forever young â™ª</i>

13:50.463 --> 13:53.832
<i> â™ª Do you really</i>
<i> want to live forever â™ª</i>

13:55.168 --> 13:58.503
<i> â™ª Forever young â™ª</i>

14:02.309 --> 14:05.243
[audience applauding]
Whoo!

14:08.615 --> 14:10.114
[Maureen] Thanks
for being our roadie.

14:10.116 --> 14:13.051
Yeah, and thank you
for being our
artist in residence.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.385
Of course.

14:16.056 --> 14:19.858
So, you went on stage tonight
as Champagne Enema.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.060
[both laugh]
What were we
thinking, right?

14:22.062 --> 14:23.828
But now...

14:23.830 --> 14:25.063
we're Rock Solid Panda.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.397
Yeah, we are.

14:26.399 --> 14:29.467
Rock Solid Panda, coming up.
I'm feeling inspired.

14:30.871 --> 14:31.936
Paint.
Paint.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.743
[Clary gasps]

14:38.745 --> 14:40.411
What's that tag?

14:41.414 --> 14:44.082
Weird, I didn't even
mean to draw that.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.750
Second time today.

14:45.752 --> 14:46.985
You know they have
confirmed cases

14:46.987 --> 14:49.320
of people waking up
in the morning
speaking French,

14:49.322 --> 14:51.823
and they never even
studied the language.

14:51.825 --> 14:53.925
Do you think that's
some kind of language?

14:53.927 --> 14:55.260
Sanskrit maybe.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.433
Hey, can you watch
where you're going?

15:05.005 --> 15:06.371
You can see me?

15:06.373 --> 15:08.072
Yeah, that's kind of
the point,

15:08.074 --> 15:10.074
but you obviously
didn't see me.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.409
You have the Sight.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.244
Wait, the what?

15:14.447 --> 15:15.847
How can I not know
who you are?

15:15.849 --> 15:18.883
Has that line seriously
ever worked for you?

15:18.885 --> 15:19.951
Even once?

15:22.856 --> 15:23.988
[Alec] Jace!

15:30.897 --> 15:32.597
Can you guys believe
that blonde dude?

15:32.599 --> 15:35.366
You mean the imaginary dude
you were talking to?

15:35.368 --> 15:37.568
[Clary] No,
the guy right there,
running into the club.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.470
[Maureen] Clary,
there's nobody there.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.972
The guy covered
in tats, like--
[stammers]

15:40.974 --> 15:43.708
What guy are you
talking about?

15:43.710 --> 15:45.710
You guys seriously
don't see him?

15:45.712 --> 15:46.811
No.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.614
Okay, could you stop
making me feel insane?

15:49.616 --> 15:51.282
Could you stop
acting that way?

15:51.284 --> 15:53.017
Clary, what was
in your latte?

15:56.056 --> 15:57.155
Where you going?

15:57.157 --> 15:58.256
To get some answers.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.991
Remember,
your fake ID sucks.

15:59.993 --> 16:01.626
[house music playing]

16:39.432 --> 16:41.833
[woman] More mundane blood
for your boss.

16:55.882 --> 16:58.449
I'm gonna go
fail at getting us
some birthday drinks.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.451
I'm gonna go fail with you.

17:00.453 --> 17:01.953
Do you want some...
Clary!

17:18.638 --> 17:21.205
Circle members
aren't welcome in my club.

17:23.043 --> 17:25.043
No worries, warlock.
It's all ancient history.

17:25.045 --> 17:29.080
Really? To me, it was like
a blink of an eye.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.150
[wincing]

17:33.153 --> 17:34.218
[choking]

17:34.754 --> 17:36.254
[man groaning]

17:36.256 --> 17:37.321
[bones crunching]

17:37.323 --> 17:40.091
[straining]
We've endured worse.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.594
You've inflicted worse.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.664
Leave.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.817
Izzy.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.943
Somebody works out.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.011
Cool contacts.

18:37.484 --> 18:40.685
I hear you've been
pedaling mundane blood.

18:41.387 --> 18:44.122
Why? Are you looking
to score?

18:45.058 --> 18:46.290
I'm not.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.161
But you're gonna
tell me who is.

18:51.097 --> 18:52.897
Well,
you're outnumbered here.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.134
Oh, I like our odds.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.971
Last chance.

19:03.143 --> 19:05.009
Watch out!

19:05.278 --> 19:07.011
[grunts]

19:08.848 --> 19:10.214
[Jace] Careful!
[Clary gasps]

19:11.184 --> 19:12.984
[roars]

19:17.123 --> 19:18.156
[groans]

19:20.193 --> 19:21.759
[grunts]

19:23.363 --> 19:24.762
Are you hurt?
[grunts]

19:30.270 --> 19:32.170
[grunting]

19:34.307 --> 19:35.907
[growls]
[grunts]

19:38.178 --> 19:40.111
[growling]
[Alec grunts]

19:45.185 --> 19:47.185
[grunting]
Alec!

19:48.521 --> 19:50.755
[grunting]

19:53.960 --> 19:55.092
[gasps]

19:57.997 --> 19:59.363
[panting]

20:02.235 --> 20:04.802
[panting] Sorry.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.082
But... Clary!

20:19.919 --> 20:21.118
Clary!

20:26.092 --> 20:27.325
Drive.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.435
And then these
creepy tentacles

20:37.437 --> 20:39.237
seemed to come out of
the body builder's face,

20:39.239 --> 20:42.540
and... and then
the guy just... vaporized.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.041
[trembling] I mean,
I was drugged, right?

20:44.043 --> 20:45.376
What did the markings
look like

20:45.378 --> 20:46.911
on the blonde boy
you were talking about?

20:46.913 --> 20:50.281
Who cares, Mom, okay?
Are you even listening to me?

20:50.283 --> 20:51.449
I think I killed a guy.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.619
Clary...
did they look like this?

20:57.457 --> 20:59.257
Mom, what the...

20:59.259 --> 21:02.927
Everything you saw tonight
has a meaning
and an explanation,

21:02.929 --> 21:05.162
and I've dreaded having
this conversation with you

21:05.164 --> 21:06.430
since the day you were born.

21:06.432 --> 21:07.765
What is going on?

21:08.601 --> 21:10.268
[stammers]
Am I going insane?

21:10.270 --> 21:12.370
No, you're not.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.738
But the protections
are wearing off.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.873
You're 18 now,
and you need to
know the truth.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.441
Protections?
What does that even mean?

21:17.443 --> 21:18.976
Mom, you...
Mom, you're scaring
the hell out of me.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.378
I know, and that's why
I've put this off

21:20.380 --> 21:22.113
until the last
possible minute.

21:22.115 --> 21:23.981
Jocelyn, look out the window.

21:23.983 --> 21:26.951
Magnus called to warn us.
They found you.

21:30.156 --> 21:32.323
Dot, it's time.

21:32.325 --> 21:34.492
Okay, listen to me.
You cannot be near me.

21:34.494 --> 21:37.094
What's happening?
I got a very
powerful person angry.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.229
What did you do?

21:38.231 --> 21:40.097
I hid something from him
and his followers.

21:40.099 --> 21:41.899
Followers?
Why can't we just
call the police?

21:41.901 --> 21:44.135
The policeman
you need to call is Luke.

21:45.305 --> 21:48.172
Keep this with you
and think of me
when you wear it.

21:48.174 --> 21:50.274
Mom, this is not the time
for more birthday gifts.

21:50.276 --> 21:51.409
What the hell
is happening?

21:51.411 --> 21:52.910
Only if you need it.

21:54.814 --> 21:58.349
Trust your instincts.
You're more powerful
than you know.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.851
[tires screech]

22:00.853 --> 22:02.219
Take Jocelyn alive.

22:02.955 --> 22:04.288
Find the Mortal Cup.

22:04.290 --> 22:06.390
Mom, I need to
understand what's--
Dot, open it.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.767
Everything I've done,

22:16.769 --> 22:18.969
every mistake I've made
was because I love you
more than words.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.938
What are you doing?
Luke will explain everything.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.340
He'll hide you.
Hide me?

22:22.342 --> 22:24.275
From the Circle.
He's the only one
you can trust.

22:24.277 --> 22:25.443
Trust no one else.

22:25.445 --> 22:26.877
Mom, I don't--
Where's Luke now?

22:26.879 --> 22:29.480
At the police station!
Remember, I love you.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.649
Mom! Mom!
[air whooshing]

22:31.651 --> 22:33.551
Clary!
Mom!

22:35.788 --> 22:38.155
[energy pulsating]
[yelps]

22:38.157 --> 22:39.790
[panting] Ow.

22:41.561 --> 22:42.626
Clary?

22:44.163 --> 22:45.830
Captain Vargas.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.998
It's 2:00 in the morning.
What are you
doing here so late?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.368
Uh, um...

22:50.370 --> 22:52.703
Luke said he'd,
uh, drive me home
if he was still here.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.506
Still doesn't trust
those cabbies, huh?

22:55.508 --> 22:59.243
Well, he's in
the middle of an interview.
It could take a while.

22:59.245 --> 23:01.679
[stammers] Cool,
I'll wait in the cafeteria.

23:01.681 --> 23:05.716
Hey, uh... is there
some sort of problem?

23:05.718 --> 23:06.917
Guy trouble?

23:07.720 --> 23:08.886
Yeah, sure.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.455
Guy trouble, it's, uh...
something like that.

23:30.710 --> 23:31.842
[grunts]

23:50.696 --> 23:53.030
[grunting]

23:58.137 --> 23:59.637
[grunts]

24:00.573 --> 24:02.606
I won't let them find you.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.068
[grunting]

24:48.921 --> 24:52.456
[yells] This could all
be over if you just
turn over the Mortal Cup.

24:52.458 --> 24:53.757
That's not gonna happen.

24:53.759 --> 24:55.659
After all these years,
you're still after it?

24:55.661 --> 24:58.696
[scoffs] It's not for us.

24:59.298 --> 25:00.664
It's for him.

25:02.368 --> 25:03.634
Valentine's still alive.

25:03.636 --> 25:06.203
He'll be pretty surprised
to see that you are, too.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.372
I won't let Valentine
create an army.

25:08.374 --> 25:09.874
You once believed in him.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.877
I believed in
protecting humankind.

25:17.550 --> 25:19.083
You'll never get the Cup.

25:22.154 --> 25:23.687
No!

25:27.693 --> 25:29.293
[thunder rumbling]

25:29.294 --> 25:30.894
[man] The minute we found out
Jocelyn Fairchild was alive,

25:30.897 --> 25:32.530
you were easy to track.

25:32.532 --> 25:33.964
Fairchild?

25:33.966 --> 25:35.165
Turns out you and Jocelyn
were never that far apart.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.534
The Circle has her now.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.669
It's just a matter of time
until we catch the daughter.

25:38.671 --> 25:41.572
You can have them both
if you give up
the Mortal Cup.

25:43.009 --> 25:46.243
I don't care
about either of them.
They mean nothing to me.

25:46.245 --> 25:48.612
[gasps]
[Luke] Kill them both
if you like.

25:49.382 --> 25:51.582
My people want the Cup.

25:51.584 --> 25:53.651
Why do you think
I've been hanging around
here all these years?

25:53.653 --> 25:55.319
Now, when I find the Cup...

25:55.922 --> 25:57.221
I'm gonna keep it.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.223
And you can tell Valentine
and the Circle that.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.591
No one mentioned Valentine.

26:00.593 --> 26:01.525
You didn't have to.

26:01.527 --> 26:03.761
Listen to me.
No, you listen to me.

26:04.764 --> 26:06.163
Get out of my office.

26:21.347 --> 26:24.481
[breathing heavily]
Mom... Mom...

26:38.931 --> 26:41.198
[creatures growling]

26:48.608 --> 26:50.608
[energy pulsating]

26:51.611 --> 26:52.810
[Valentine sighs]

27:05.458 --> 27:06.724
[Valentine] You've returned.

27:08.561 --> 27:11.395
I'm so sorry it had to be
this way, Jocelyn.

27:13.666 --> 27:16.400
[breathes deeply]

27:19.338 --> 27:21.639
I told you to
bring her back unharmed.

27:23.809 --> 27:24.908
What happened?

27:24.910 --> 27:26.644
A potion.

27:26.646 --> 27:28.512
She must have been
under the protection
of a warlock.

27:28.514 --> 27:31.815
She was in league
with the Downworlder,
hiding amongst the mundane.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.317
Coward.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.854
Jocelyn Fairchild
was able to hide from
the Circle for 18 years.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.822
Do you think a coward
is capable of
something like that?

27:38.824 --> 27:41.492
The only thing
she's capable of is
smelling like a mundane.

27:44.764 --> 27:45.829
I'm sorry?

27:45.831 --> 27:47.798
She betrayed the Circle.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.199
She doesn't deserve
our respect.

27:49.201 --> 27:51.435
[flesh searing]
[groaning]

27:54.840 --> 27:57.041
[screaming]

28:07.820 --> 28:09.687
Mom! Mom!

28:09.689 --> 28:10.754
[gasps]

28:13.893 --> 28:15.893
Mom! [panting]

28:18.998 --> 28:22.766
[crying] Mom...

28:23.703 --> 28:25.235
[sobbing]

28:26.906 --> 28:28.405
[screams] Mom!

28:32.712 --> 28:34.211
[wailing]

28:36.916 --> 28:38.482
[breathing deeply]

28:45.191 --> 28:47.224
[thunder rumbling]

28:55.534 --> 28:56.734
[thunder rumbles]
[gasps]

29:14.086 --> 29:15.619
[gasps]

29:24.797 --> 29:25.963
Dot.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.466
They took Jocelyn.

29:29.769 --> 29:31.368
Who took her?

29:31.370 --> 29:35.038
Rogue Shadowhunters
searching for
the Mortal Cup.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.874
What the hell are you
talking about?

29:37.710 --> 29:39.376
Think, Clary.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.311
Did your mother
ever talk to you
about a cup?

29:41.313 --> 29:42.613
A very important cup.

29:42.615 --> 29:44.782
[stuttering] It's gold,
almost like a chalice.

29:44.784 --> 29:47.251
No! No, I don't know
anything about a cup, Dot.

29:47.253 --> 29:49.119
[stammers] One of
the antiquities downstairs?

29:49.121 --> 29:50.921
No, no, not those.

29:50.923 --> 29:53.423
[inhales deeply]
Think, Clary.
This could save Jocelyn.

29:53.425 --> 29:56.727
I can't think!
Someone kidnapped
my mother!

29:56.729 --> 29:59.429
You know more than
you think you do,
Clary Fray.

29:59.431 --> 30:00.964
[screeching]

30:00.966 --> 30:03.567
[Clary grunts and groans]

30:03.569 --> 30:04.802
[Dot growling]

30:04.804 --> 30:07.004
[screeches]

30:07.006 --> 30:08.205
[exclaims]

30:10.643 --> 30:12.342
[growls]
[Clary gasps]

30:19.485 --> 30:20.751
[crying]

30:20.753 --> 30:22.419
[screeches]

30:25.024 --> 30:26.557
[gasps]

30:29.361 --> 30:31.862
What, no "thank you"
for saving your life?

30:33.933 --> 30:36.333
Careful. That demon
got a piece of you.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.937
Demons?
Yeah.

30:39.939 --> 30:42.306
What do you think
that miserable,
disgusting thing was?

30:42.308 --> 30:44.675
I, uh...
I thought it was Dot.

30:44.677 --> 30:48.045
[voice echoes]
No, Ravener demon,
shapeshifter.

30:48.047 --> 30:50.848
[sighs] You're just
saying words now.

30:50.850 --> 30:53.984
[pants] Why...
why is the room swirling?

30:53.986 --> 30:55.052
Demon venom.

30:55.054 --> 30:55.886
[breathing heavily]

30:55.888 --> 30:57.554
It's that bad?

31:03.729 --> 31:04.962
I got you.

31:12.004 --> 31:13.971
[low humming]

31:15.407 --> 31:17.441
[muttering]

31:20.079 --> 31:22.880
[Valentine] Jocelyn,
you're back with me.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.083
[moaning]

31:28.587 --> 31:30.087
[gasps]
[smacks head]

31:30.089 --> 31:31.321
Ow.

31:31.323 --> 31:33.090
[sighs]

31:33.092 --> 31:36.260
Wait, I don't know
who you--
I'm Isabelle.

31:36.262 --> 31:39.229
I've never seen Jace
so curious
about a mundane...

31:40.065 --> 31:41.765
or distracted.

31:41.767 --> 31:45.102
Like you saw earlier,
distractions are dangerous
in our line of work.

31:45.104 --> 31:47.271
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.605
Who's Jace?

31:48.607 --> 31:52.009
You really don't know much,
do you?

31:52.011 --> 31:55.746
All I know is some psychos
took my mother, and now
you people have taken me.

31:55.748 --> 32:00.017
[chuckles] And by "taken"
I assume you mean
"saved your life"?

32:01.720 --> 32:02.786
[Alec] A mundane
shouldn't even be here.

32:02.788 --> 32:03.921
Where is
"here" exactly?

32:03.923 --> 32:06.123
She's not a mundane, Alec.
How do you know that?

32:06.125 --> 32:08.292
Because the seraph blade
lit up when she touched it.

32:08.294 --> 32:09.927
Look, Isabelle,
can you...

32:09.929 --> 32:13.263
[sighs] I'm Jace Wayland.

32:13.265 --> 32:16.199
I'm, uh--
Clary Fray,
we know who you are.

32:16.201 --> 32:18.068
Am I the only one
who finds this unusual?

32:18.070 --> 32:20.103
You find everything
unusual, Alec.

32:20.105 --> 32:21.138
[Alec] I have to
report this to the Clave.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.206
[Jace] You know what?
Dial it down a notch.

32:23.208 --> 32:25.108
[Isabelle] My brother
doesn't have a dial.

32:25.110 --> 32:28.111
I love you, Alec,
but you have
a switch that's always on.

32:28.113 --> 32:29.780
I love you, too.
But this--

32:29.782 --> 32:32.983
Hey, you know what?
Give me a minute.

32:35.387 --> 32:38.055
Here's a word you
never hear me say.
Please?

32:39.558 --> 32:40.824
What is with you?

32:40.826 --> 32:42.259
Really, no,
what is with him?

32:42.261 --> 32:44.061
Walk with me,
big brother.

32:46.632 --> 32:47.998
I'll explain it to you.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.099
We don't know this girl.

32:49.101 --> 32:50.934
There's no such thing
as new Shadowhunters.

32:50.936 --> 32:53.003
There is now.
You don't find that strange?

32:53.005 --> 32:56.139
What I find strange
is that you're so upset.

32:56.141 --> 32:59.776
Maybe you're upset
by the way Jace is
looking at her. [chuckles]

32:59.778 --> 33:02.279
You know, you should be
happy that Jace
is interested in someone

33:02.281 --> 33:03.513
other than himself.

33:03.515 --> 33:05.649
Maybe I'm pissed
that she's ruined
the mission.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.684
We never found out
who's buying the blood.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.353
That was our one job.

33:12.624 --> 33:15.025
Your wound, it's healed.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.829
How is that even possible?

33:18.831 --> 33:22.165
So, what,
I'm miraculously healed,
and all of you...

33:22.167 --> 33:25.168
stunning people
have magical powers?

33:25.170 --> 33:28.038
[scoffs] No.
No, don't confuse me
with a warlock.

33:28.040 --> 33:31.041
A what?
A warlock.
It's one of the Downworlders.

33:31.043 --> 33:33.043
Okay, you're not
making any sense.

33:34.146 --> 33:35.779
Warlocks, vampires,
Seelies--

33:35.781 --> 33:38.148
Literally my brain
is about to explode.

33:38.150 --> 33:40.250
Jeez, all right.
Well, I'll keep it
simple for you.

33:41.286 --> 33:43.120
All the legends are true.

33:44.156 --> 33:46.056
We're Shadowhunters.

33:46.058 --> 33:49.192
We protect the human world
from the demon world.

33:49.194 --> 33:53.196
So those people
you saw murdered
at the Pandemonium,

33:53.198 --> 33:56.033
they weren't people at all,
they were
shapeshifting demons.

33:56.035 --> 34:00.404
I'm not interested
in being a part of your
supernatural fight club.

34:01.573 --> 34:04.241
I just wanna find my mom.

34:04.243 --> 34:05.709
[voice breaking]
The rest of it,
whatever it is,

34:05.711 --> 34:06.810
all I care about

34:06.812 --> 34:08.145
is finding my mother.

34:10.082 --> 34:11.381
[softly] Please.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.484
Please help me find her.

34:15.821 --> 34:17.454
I'm the best chance
you've got.

34:20.059 --> 34:21.892
I don't even know you.

34:23.429 --> 34:25.262
[cell phone ringing]

34:26.565 --> 34:28.265
Simon.

34:28.267 --> 34:30.167
How come you haven't answered
your phone in two days?

34:30.169 --> 34:32.769
Things are...
all ripped apart.

34:32.771 --> 34:34.271
Where are you?

34:34.273 --> 34:35.872
Find My Friends
says your phone is

34:35.874 --> 34:37.441
in an abandoned church
on Deighton.

34:37.443 --> 34:38.809
I'm outside.

34:44.016 --> 34:45.415
[exhales] I see you.

34:45.417 --> 34:46.917
I don't see you.

34:46.919 --> 34:48.752
Give me five minutes.
I have to get dressed.

34:48.754 --> 34:51.188
[Simon] <i> Dressed?</i>
<i>What are you doing undressed</i>
<i> in an abandoned church?</i>

34:51.190 --> 34:54.257
Clary, is there...
Is there a meth problem
we have to talk about?

34:54.259 --> 34:56.493
Simon, just give me
five minutes, okay?

34:58.263 --> 35:01.198
Um, what, uh...
What happened to my clothes?

35:01.200 --> 35:02.065
Demon venom.

35:02.067 --> 35:04.000
Remember?

35:04.536 --> 35:06.036
Isabelle left you these.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.740
[chuckles]

35:10.742 --> 35:11.875
You're kidding, right?

35:11.877 --> 35:14.511
She's very comfortable
with her body.

35:16.115 --> 35:17.481
Okay.

35:23.655 --> 35:25.122
[huffs]

35:25.124 --> 35:26.556
How did that get there?

35:26.558 --> 35:28.225
I drew that.

35:28.227 --> 35:29.643
Okay, listen.

35:29.644 --> 35:31.060
I still don't get everything
that's going on here,

35:31.063 --> 35:32.829
but you do not
tattoo my neck.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.331
That's creepy.

35:34.333 --> 35:37.400
Duly noted.
I guess next time
I'll just let you die.

35:38.403 --> 35:40.237
And it's not a tattoo.

35:41.340 --> 35:42.305
It's a rune.

35:43.342 --> 35:46.143
They have enormous power.

35:46.145 --> 35:48.011
Good for Shadowhunters.

35:48.013 --> 35:49.446
Lethal for humans.

35:49.448 --> 35:52.649
But you, you already know
all about runes, don't you?

35:58.290 --> 35:59.389
Maybe you don't.

36:01.193 --> 36:04.628
Which is what makes you
so interesting...

36:04.630 --> 36:06.696
Clary Fray.

36:09.768 --> 36:12.669
I saw something
behind your friend.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.337
You're not gonna
kill Simon, are you?

36:14.339 --> 36:18.308
Protect the humans,
kill the demons.
You'll get it eventually.

36:18.310 --> 36:20.010
[door opens]

36:20.012 --> 36:22.546
So, why can't Simon see you?

36:22.548 --> 36:27.184
This is a glamour,
a rune that makes me
invisible to mundanes.

36:27.186 --> 36:28.852
It's a shame,
really, 'cause...

36:28.854 --> 36:30.387
well, denying them all this.

36:32.324 --> 36:35.292
What do you have on, Clary?

36:36.895 --> 36:38.895
Let me take you home.

36:38.897 --> 36:40.964
I don't think
I have one anymore.

36:40.966 --> 36:43.099
Why? What do you mean?

36:44.736 --> 36:46.036
Well...

36:46.038 --> 36:48.071
[man] Clary Fairchild!

36:52.544 --> 36:54.411
[gasps]
Clary, what's going on?

36:55.547 --> 36:56.680
What are you looking at?

36:56.682 --> 36:58.748
If you give us the girl,
I'll let you live.

36:58.750 --> 37:01.184
You're in no position
to be making rules.

37:01.186 --> 37:03.153
[Jace grunts]
[Clary gasps]

37:03.155 --> 37:04.287
Clary...

37:05.390 --> 37:06.389
[yelps]

37:11.763 --> 37:13.663
[both grunting]

37:13.665 --> 37:16.766
[strained] We'll never stop
hunting her.
This is for my father.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.702
[gasps]

37:18.704 --> 37:20.570
[panting]

37:20.572 --> 37:22.405
Jace!
Excuse me?

37:23.609 --> 37:25.976
Is he dead?
Is who dead?

37:29.948 --> 37:31.381
What the...

37:31.383 --> 37:32.882
Could you deglamourize,
or whatever,

37:32.884 --> 37:35.418
so my best friend
doesn't think
I'm losing my mind?

37:42.628 --> 37:44.794
Um...
what is happening?

37:44.796 --> 37:47.731
Yeah, we don't have
the luxury right now, kid.
Everyone back inside.

37:47.733 --> 37:49.132
Clary, who is this?
Your meth dealer?

37:49.134 --> 37:51.268
I've seen him before.
At the police station.

37:51.270 --> 37:54.237
He's a member of the Circle.
Clary, he's here for you.

37:54.239 --> 37:55.572
He's with the people
who took my mother.

37:55.574 --> 37:58.275
Right, your little
best friend here
led him right to you.

37:58.277 --> 38:00.310
He's here to capture
or kill you.

38:00.312 --> 38:02.245
There's a dead body there,
we have to call Luke.

38:02.247 --> 38:05.148
We can't trust Luke, Simon.
We can't.

38:05.150 --> 38:08.418
Clary, I need to
keep you safe.

38:08.420 --> 38:13.256
I promise you,
I promise I am gonna
help you find your mother.

38:13.258 --> 38:15.292
But you're one of us.
You're a Shadowhunter.

38:15.294 --> 38:16.459
[Simon] What are you
talking about?

38:16.461 --> 38:20.930
Clary... you don't know
this guy, all right?

38:20.932 --> 38:23.400
Come with me.
I can get us help.

38:23.402 --> 38:24.334
Clary, please.

38:24.336 --> 38:26.202
Clary, come on.

38:30.609 --> 38:32.909
I don't see the Mortal Cup!

38:33.979 --> 38:35.812
We searched.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.647
It's not in the loft.

38:37.649 --> 38:41.518
Just because
you couldn't find it
doesn't mean it isn't there.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.489
There's a daughter.

38:46.491 --> 38:49.359
[stammering] It looks
just like Jocelyn.

38:49.361 --> 38:51.428
There's no sign
of the father.

38:52.030 --> 38:54.064
Could be a mundane.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.369
Jocelyn has a daughter?

39:00.305 --> 39:01.705
[inhales]

39:01.707 --> 39:05.542
Well, in that case,
I'd like to speak to
Jocelyn's daughter.
