Aaron, step aside.

12:26.771 --> 12:28.246
Now.

12:29.524 --> 12:30.290
I don't know who the      you
are but this only ends one way.

12:30.399 --> 12:31.916
It doesn't have to.

12:32.026 --> 12:32.667
We just wanna help.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.753
Didn't ask, don't want.

12:34.862 --> 12:37.964
Hey, Hopper, she's the one
I was telling you about, ok?

12:38.074 --> 12:39.257
She can turn dad back.

12:39.367 --> 12:40.300
Fake news.

12:40.409 --> 12:41.450
All of it.

12:41.503 --> 12:44.262
For all we know she's a goddamn
vampire, too.

12:44.372 --> 12:45.472
You're not gonna get a bounty
on these guys.

12:45.623 --> 12:46.598
You gotta know that by now.

12:46.707 --> 12:48.475
Bounty?

12:48.626 --> 12:50.310
Go to hell.

12:50.419 --> 12:52.145
Maybe I'll send you straight
there myself.

12:52.296 --> 12:53.271
[cocks gun]

12:56.184 --> 12:59.402
We can help each other,
just not like this.

12:59.521 --> 13:01.654
I'm gonna say it one more time.

13:01.806 --> 13:03.156
Move away from the girl.

13:03.266 --> 13:04.115
Hey.

13:10.624 --> 13:11.956
[gun shot]

13:18.873 --> 13:19.506
No!

13:19.657 --> 13:20.256
Easy, easy, easy.

13:20.375 --> 13:21.591
Easy.

13:21.709 --> 13:25.178
[snarling]

13:33.596 --> 13:36.314
[vomiting]

13:40.770 --> 13:42.111
Holy shit.

13:42.230 --> 13:43.530
[coughing]

13:43.639 --> 13:44.697
Look!

14:01.249 --> 14:03.508
What did you do?

14:03.960 --> 14:08.054
Ended your pain,
Mr. President.

14:14.846 --> 14:16.646
Are you ok?

14:16.764 --> 14:18.189
Mmmhmm.

14:19.267 --> 14:23.528
You know, I didn't know
if I'd ever get him back.

14:23.638 --> 14:25.196
But you...

14:26.316 --> 14:27.907
Thank you.

14:32.447 --> 14:34.706
What?

14:34.815 --> 14:37.750
Not what I was expecting.

14:38.161 --> 14:46.384
You, the president, and a bunch
of bikers living together.

14:46.494 --> 14:47.844
I know.

14:50.048 --> 14:52.348
The day of the rising

14:52.467 --> 14:54.475
me and my dad were
in the White House.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.604
My mom and sister were
in Virginia.

14:57.755 --> 15:00.648
When it all went crazy,

15:00.734 --> 15:03.735
the secret service
evacuated us.

15:03.844 --> 15:08.281
They were in their convoy,
me and my dad in another.

15:08.432 --> 15:10.450
We were supposed to meet up
at Air Force One

15:10.601 --> 15:14.621
and get taken to some
secure bunker.

15:14.730 --> 15:17.123
But it went wrong.

15:17.274 --> 15:22.253
We got attacked
just outside Baltimore.

15:22.363 --> 15:24.422
The protection detail,

15:24.532 --> 15:31.095
they held them off for a while
but they were overrun.

15:31.205 --> 15:33.172
My dad got bit...

15:37.103 --> 15:38.019
I mean, the only reason
we survived

15:38.104 --> 15:41.230
was they locked us
inside that limo.

15:41.599 --> 15:45.526
That thing was designed to
survive a terrorist attack so.

15:45.612 --> 15:46.235
So...

15:46.780 --> 15:50.031
I guess it did its job.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.367
You were stuck inside
the car

15:52.452 --> 15:58.456
with your dad
while he was turning.

15:58.566 --> 16:01.459
You're wondering
how I never got turned.

16:03.287 --> 16:07.507
You know, my dad, he fought
the urge to bite me.

16:07.658 --> 16:09.676
He did.

16:10.044 --> 16:12.345
But it was too strong.

16:12.496 --> 16:13.304
So I scrambled to the front.

16:13.414 --> 16:16.975
I put up that bulletproof glass.

16:17.084 --> 16:19.435
I sealed him in.

16:20.972 --> 16:26.150
There was nothing else
I could do, you know?

16:31.315 --> 16:35.952
You know, I'm just... I'm not
the kid I was before the rising.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.625
I've seen some heavy shit.

16:43.494 --> 16:45.336
Yeah.

16:45.446 --> 16:47.005
But your dad's been
through a lot.

16:47.114 --> 16:48.631
Yeah.

16:49.417 --> 16:52.844
You and Hopper.

16:52.953 --> 16:57.015
You guys did the best
you could.

16:57.124 --> 17:01.269
And even if your dad
couldn't share it

17:01.354 --> 17:03.813
I know he felt it.

17:05.808 --> 17:07.108
You did a good job.

17:08.862 --> 17:14.615
I just... I couldn't get
what I needed from him.

17:16.611 --> 17:19.287
Maybe I don't want it anymore,
you know?

17:20.540 --> 17:23.666
There's only one way
to find out.

17:33.044 --> 17:35.053
Look at you.

17:38.391 --> 17:42.185
Strong and handsome.

17:42.303 --> 17:44.228
A man.

17:49.069 --> 17:53.571
So, curious, aren't you?

17:53.681 --> 17:56.532
As to why me and my boys
have uh, well...

17:56.651 --> 18:01.120
The 45th President of the United
States as a house guest?

18:01.272 --> 18:03.831
Yeah, it'd be kinda weird
if I wasn't.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.708
We weren't trying to profit
from him,

18:05.827 --> 18:08.252
and that's for damn sure.

18:08.362 --> 18:12.673
He was long dead as far as
anyone was concerned.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.759
Hell, I didn't even vote
for the man.

18:14.869 --> 18:17.470
Hated his politics.

18:17.580 --> 18:20.348
Saw him as a threat to
the whole damn country.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.767
Go figure.

18:22.877 --> 18:24.310
And yet...

18:24.420 --> 18:28.606
Vampire or not,
he was the President.

18:28.716 --> 18:32.902
Represented something
that mattered.

18:33.020 --> 18:35.029
Still matters.

18:35.115 --> 18:39.242
The flag, the republic,
my heart, my soul.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.911
Those sons of bitches,
they took enough from us.

18:42.029 --> 18:45.081
They weren't gonna get him, too.

18:47.201 --> 18:49.752
Now, that sounds crazy, right?

18:49.871 --> 18:55.007
Protecting someone for reasons
you don't even fully understand.

18:55.710 --> 18:58.177
No, I think trusting your gut

18:58.329 --> 19:01.514
and doing what you think
is right,

19:01.665 --> 19:04.559
that might be the only real
thing we got left.

19:07.722 --> 19:13.609
So, he's human again
thanks to Violet.

19:13.728 --> 19:15.945
What happens now?

19:18.274 --> 19:19.282
Hmph.

19:24.113 --> 19:26.164
So Archer's dead?

19:26.273 --> 19:28.791
And the- the rest
of the government,

19:28.910 --> 19:32.962
I mean, nobody else is aware
that Archer isn't Archer?

19:33.080 --> 19:34.463
There's no way of knowing that
without getting

19:35.766 --> 19:37.592
on the other side of the wall,
which is why we need you.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.135
You can get us in.

19:39.253 --> 19:40.636
Make them listen.

19:41.939 --> 19:44.790
Help our plans to take out
the Dark One once and for all.

19:48.679 --> 19:50.438
I'm not in charge.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.606
You're the president.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.192
I was the president.

19:54.301 --> 19:56.485
Past tense.

19:56.854 --> 20:02.700
My powers ended the moment
they swore in my replacement.

20:02.810 --> 20:07.288
You're not a vampire anymore,
ok?

20:07.373 --> 20:09.457
You're sure as hell not dead.

20:10.201 --> 20:11.325
That's true.

20:12.036 --> 20:14.337
But the fact remains I don't
have any more authority

20:14.455 --> 20:16.714
right now than anyone else
in this room.

20:16.824 --> 20:17.924
You don't know that.

20:18.075 --> 20:21.552
The 25th amendment of
the Constitution says that.

20:21.662 --> 20:23.262
They would have invoked it.

20:23.414 --> 20:26.015
<i> Axel: You still stand</i>
<i> for something.</i>

20:26.133 --> 20:27.892
<i> People remember.</i>

20:28.002 --> 20:30.019
<i> It matters.</i>

20:30.137 --> 20:33.439
What's left of the world
has changed.

20:33.590 --> 20:36.525
Moved on.

20:36.644 --> 20:38.945
I'm a relic of the past.

20:40.815 --> 20:42.156
That's bullshit.

20:42.650 --> 20:43.699
Look.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.660
We kept this.

20:46.246 --> 20:51.040
And I always knew
it'd be the answer.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.293
Come on, Dad.

20:54.445 --> 20:55.753
Open it.

20:55.863 --> 20:57.546
Only you can.

21:05.548 --> 21:07.014
Please, Dad.

21:07.341 --> 21:08.849
You have to.

21:23.858 --> 21:24.907
Ok.

21:36.579 --> 21:40.464
Yes. Yes, finally.

21:43.252 --> 21:45.386
What is that?

21:45.471 --> 21:47.054
It's the football.

21:47.140 --> 21:50.224
Y- you- you mean
the nuclear football.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.184
It's a little more than that.

21:52.336 --> 21:53.269
It also serves as a direct link

21:53.387 --> 21:56.772
to operational command
at the Pentagon.

21:56.891 --> 21:57.857
Yeah, we can contact
the military,

21:58.008 --> 21:58.733
tell them what's going on-

21:58.818 --> 22:00.818
Not anymore. Not anymore.

22:02.096 --> 22:04.322
They- look, as far as Washington
is concerned I died years ago.

22:04.431 --> 22:06.157
We won't know unless we try.

22:06.266 --> 22:07.616
They'd just assume
I was an imposter.

22:07.735 --> 22:09.076
Do you understand?

22:09.162 --> 22:15.666
Me and that device, we are
footnotes to history.

22:21.123 --> 22:22.882
Look, I'm sorry, but...

22:29.465 --> 22:30.890
You know what?

22:32.009 --> 22:36.445
Hey. Hey.

22:40.351 --> 22:44.737
Forget about contacting
Washington, ok?

22:44.888 --> 22:47.365
They've moved on.

22:47.474 --> 22:51.410
They left us for dead.

22:51.562 --> 22:57.416
But you can still use this
to find mom and Tina.

23:01.205 --> 23:03.297
A secondary communications link,
right?

23:03.383 --> 23:06.384
It has access to the secret
service shortwave.

23:06.493 --> 23:08.636
Their GPS trail.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.262
We can locate them.

23:10.965 --> 23:12.139
We can find them.

23:12.225 --> 23:14.141
Aaron.

23:14.227 --> 23:16.811
I've been hacking
this thing for months.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.604
And now that we have it...

23:18.848 --> 23:20.022
Son.

23:20.141 --> 23:21.273
What?

23:22.017 --> 23:24.860
We could be together again.

23:24.979 --> 23:27.738
A family like we used to be.

23:27.848 --> 23:29.990
They're all gone, son.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.743
All of them.

23:32.853 --> 23:36.539
The day of the rising.

23:36.657 --> 23:37.706
It was the last communication

23:37.825 --> 23:40.751
I got right before our convoy
got attacked.

23:40.861 --> 23:42.461
They were already compromised.

23:42.613 --> 23:43.921
No.

23:45.416 --> 23:46.632
That's not true.

23:46.783 --> 23:49.802
It is, son.
I'm so sorry.

23:49.953 --> 23:51.679
There were no survivors.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.180
I'm so sorry.

23:53.266 --> 23:57.476
You know- what happened
to you?

23:57.628 --> 24:01.021
God, you used to be a man
people believed in.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.691
Who I believed in.

24:03.776 --> 24:07.069
Now you're too scared
to do what needs doing.

24:07.188 --> 24:10.072
To live in hope.

24:10.191 --> 24:12.700
But not me.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.660
I never gave up.

24:14.811 --> 24:16.662
And I won't now.

24:16.813 --> 24:17.496
You don't understand.

24:17.606 --> 24:19.665
No, you don't!

24:19.816 --> 24:23.586
I- I thought she gave you
back to me.

24:23.704 --> 24:25.337
I guess I never realized
that a part of you

24:25.489 --> 24:27.298
really did die that day.

24:38.385 --> 24:39.101
Hey!

24:39.220 --> 24:39.685
They're not dead.

24:39.795 --> 24:41.353
I can prove it.

24:42.556 --> 24:42.980
I figure I get on the road,
use the signal to find them.

24:43.090 --> 24:44.523
Aaron, your dad.

24:45.485 --> 24:47.943
Look, he's too chicken shit, ok,
but I'm not.

24:48.062 --> 24:48.986
Ok, well you don't know
what you'll find

24:49.096 --> 24:51.071
or what you'll face out there.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.364
Now, if it was your family
out there,

24:52.474 --> 24:55.201
if you had a chance
to find them alive,

24:55.352 --> 24:56.368
wouldn't you risk everything?

24:56.478 --> 24:57.411
I would.

24:57.497 --> 24:58.370
I am.

24:59.106 --> 25:00.789
That's why I need to get
to D.C.

25:01.242 --> 25:03.542
They're not that far away, ok?

25:03.694 --> 25:05.419
I gotta steal a truck.

25:05.505 --> 25:07.213
Ok, well you can't go alone.

25:07.364 --> 25:08.589
Watch me.

25:08.674 --> 25:11.926
No, I mean we can all go
with you.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.469
You heard my dad.

25:13.587 --> 25:14.428
No.

25:14.514 --> 25:16.263
He thinks they're dead.

25:16.349 --> 25:18.140
Maybe he never leaves
this place.

25:18.259 --> 25:21.310
Too frightened to face
the truth.

25:21.428 --> 25:23.896
What if it was just me?

25:24.006 --> 25:26.232
What if I went with you?

25:26.383 --> 25:27.733
You'd do that?

25:27.884 --> 25:29.151
Yeah.

25:30.304 --> 25:30.528
Well, maybe I can help you
and then we can come back

25:31.105 --> 25:32.154
and convince your dad

25:33.290 --> 25:34.323
that there's something
still worth fighting for.

25:34.441 --> 25:36.742
You're just like him.

25:36.893 --> 25:37.910
Caught up in your own shit.

25:38.020 --> 25:39.411
Excuse me?

25:39.521 --> 25:40.829
Don't give me that.

25:40.948 --> 25:41.830
My dad died, ok?

25:41.949 --> 25:43.082
Right in front of my eyes.

25:43.233 --> 25:44.232
So don't pretend like
your feelings

25:44.285 --> 25:48.087
are somehow more valid
than anyone else's.

25:49.623 --> 25:52.591
Then you know how important
this is.

26:00.634 --> 26:02.935
I think I can help you
get through.

26:03.045 --> 26:04.979
Word is there's coyote tunnels,

26:05.064 --> 26:08.148
supposedly run under the wall
a couple hours north of here.

26:08.234 --> 26:09.692
A town called Pendleton.

26:09.810 --> 26:11.527
When can we set out?

26:11.645 --> 26:12.653
Well, that's the thing.

26:12.738 --> 26:14.780
If what you say is true,

26:14.890 --> 26:17.116
the President's not safe
back in D.C.

26:17.267 --> 26:18.284
Safest thing to do is-

26:18.435 --> 26:19.201
Woah, ho, ho.

26:19.320 --> 26:19.994
Biggs.

26:20.321 --> 26:23.122
Snuck up behind me, boss.

26:23.273 --> 26:24.456
Took the keys to the truck.

26:24.608 --> 26:25.958
Goddammit, Aaron.

26:26.068 --> 26:27.334
And Violet.

26:28.829 --> 26:30.713
They can't be more than
about an hour ahead of us.

26:30.831 --> 26:31.964
We'll catch up to them.

26:33.016 --> 26:33.257
It's not the first time
we had to keep Aaron

26:34.017 --> 26:35.301
from doing something stupid.

26:36.278 --> 26:36.427
It's just a question
of where they went.

26:37.113 --> 26:39.138
I got a pretty good idea.

26:40.049 --> 26:44.518
Aaron figured out the last
position of my wife's convoy.

26:44.604 --> 26:45.978
Well, if we get close enough
to Violet

26:46.088 --> 26:47.354
I can find her from there.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.481
It's hard to explain
but I got a sixth sense

26:49.633 --> 26:51.650
when it comes
to Van Helsings.

26:51.760 --> 26:52.818
Let's do it.

26:53.871 --> 26:54.236
Biggs, you and I travel
with the Sergeant.

26:55.281 --> 26:56.864
The rest of you stay here,
keep the President safe.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.324
That won't be necessary.

26:58.433 --> 26:59.825
Sir?

27:01.061 --> 27:03.037
If anyone should save Aaron
from himself it should be me.

27:03.122 --> 27:07.541
It's not safe, Mr. President.

27:07.627 --> 27:08.792
After all you've done for me,
Hopper,

27:08.902 --> 27:13.505
I- I think you've earned the
right to just call me Davis.

27:13.657 --> 27:15.549
I left my son without a father
for long enough

27:15.635 --> 27:18.761
and you've been a hell
of a surrogate.

27:18.879 --> 27:22.014
But time for me to step
back up to the plate.

27:24.093 --> 27:25.768
You heard the man.

27:26.887 --> 27:28.354
Lock and load.

27:43.329 --> 27:46.705
[laughing softly]

27:46.815 --> 27:47.873
You didn't.

27:47.983 --> 27:49.917
All true.

27:50.002 --> 27:54.630
One and only trip
to the White House.

27:54.748 --> 27:57.716
Fifteen years old,
slipped that mug

27:57.826 --> 28:01.762
with the presidential seal
right into my back pack.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.764
[laughing]

28:03.849 --> 28:05.808
Isn't that basically treason?

28:05.926 --> 28:08.394
Uh, not unless you get caught.

28:08.503 --> 28:09.228
Yeah.

28:10.130 --> 28:12.272
Sure as hell paying for it now,
though.

28:14.184 --> 28:17.069
So we nearly crossed paths.

28:17.220 --> 28:20.239
I guess.

28:20.348 --> 28:23.075
I don't think you would have
liked me back then.

28:23.185 --> 28:24.993
Uh, who says I like you now?

28:25.112 --> 28:26.578
[laughs]

28:26.730 --> 28:30.290
I mean, I just- they kept me
out of the limelight, you know?

28:30.376 --> 28:33.460
A bit of a socially backward
loner in those days.

28:33.546 --> 28:36.463
Uh... nobody wanted
to be friends

28:36.549 --> 28:38.507
with the president's kid.

28:41.837 --> 28:46.181
My dad enrolled my twin and I
into military school.

28:46.300 --> 28:48.183
Seriously?

28:48.302 --> 28:49.476
Isn't that like child abuse?

28:49.562 --> 28:50.769
[laughs]

28:50.921 --> 28:53.439
Uh, it wasn't that bad.

28:53.548 --> 28:56.108
And look around.

28:56.218 --> 28:58.610
Not a terrible skill set
to have now.

28:58.762 --> 29:00.112
Yeah.

29:02.232 --> 29:04.825
Survivors.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.369
That's what our parents made us.

29:09.156 --> 29:13.125
Hey um, you ever used one
of these before?

29:13.327 --> 29:14.460
What?

29:14.611 --> 29:16.044
We're not alone.

29:16.538 --> 29:20.174
[snarling]

29:20.259 --> 29:20.799
Get in the car.

29:20.951 --> 29:21.759
I've got this.

29:21.868 --> 29:22.468
Are you kidding me?

29:22.577 --> 29:24.303
I'm not hiding anymore.

29:24.671 --> 29:25.262
[snarling]

29:25.372 --> 29:26.805
[gunshots]

29:32.930 --> 29:34.480
[gunshots]

29:35.941 --> 29:37.149
[gun shot]

29:38.277 --> 29:43.322
[snarling]

29:43.431 --> 29:44.990
[fighting grunts]

29:53.626 --> 29:58.170
[fighting grunts]

29:58.321 --> 29:59.922
[gun shot]

30:02.376 --> 30:03.342
You ugly son of a bitch!

30:03.493 --> 30:07.679
[gunshots]

30:07.789 --> 30:09.515
Suck on that, asshole!

30:13.145 --> 30:14.019
[vomiting]

30:14.129 --> 30:15.020
I got him!

30:15.889 --> 30:17.189
Violet, I shot him right
in the face!

30:18.433 --> 30:19.858
Aaron, look out!

30:21.103 --> 30:22.110
[cries out]

30:23.230 --> 30:25.197
[gun shot]

30:25.307 --> 30:27.282
[gasping]

31:03.103 --> 31:10.450
Years of chaos and suffering.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.786
And survival.

31:13.488 --> 31:15.330
Not everybody backed down.

31:16.158 --> 31:17.499
A lot of people fought.

31:17.618 --> 31:19.251
Resisted.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.713
This is my fault.

31:23.540 --> 31:26.216
Nobody knew this was
gonna happen.

31:29.555 --> 31:30.846
I did.

31:32.841 --> 31:34.391
A briefing.

31:35.510 --> 31:37.311
My first month in office.

31:40.057 --> 31:43.150
They sit you down
in the Oval Office

31:43.235 --> 31:48.822
and they bring you in
the file.

31:48.908 --> 31:52.868
The dossier of all the stuff
that's eyes only.

31:54.914 --> 31:58.332
All the crazy truths most
everyone else would think

31:58.417 --> 32:02.210
are just a tinfoil hat
conspiracy theories.

32:03.747 --> 32:06.256
They told you about vampires?

32:11.931 --> 32:13.221
Yeah.

32:14.758 --> 32:16.516
Amongst other things.

32:19.605 --> 32:24.816
I- I didn't wanna believe
any of it.

32:24.968 --> 32:27.486
As though being president
I got to pick and choose

32:27.637 --> 32:32.199
what was real
and what wasn't.

32:32.284 --> 32:35.202
Nobody knew that volcano
was gonna pop off.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.495
That all this would unfold.

32:37.806 --> 32:39.998
I should have taken the threat
more seriously long before that.

32:40.150 --> 32:43.710
All this... loss!

32:45.631 --> 32:48.006
It happened on my watch.

32:48.158 --> 32:50.258
And we can still make it right.

32:50.377 --> 32:52.302
We help kill the Dark One.

32:52.412 --> 32:54.304
Once that happens people
are gonna need someone

32:54.414 --> 32:55.097
to bring hope back.

32:55.215 --> 32:57.683
Someone to believe in.

32:57.834 --> 32:58.558
You think that's me?

32:58.644 --> 33:01.144
Hell yeah, it's gotta be you.

33:02.481 --> 33:06.650
Look, I- I never thought fate
was a thing.

33:06.760 --> 33:09.987
Destiny and higher powers
and all that shit.

33:10.096 --> 33:12.739
But there's a reason that
we stumbled across Aaron.

33:12.825 --> 33:14.574
We found you.

33:14.660 --> 33:17.035
It has to be.

33:17.187 --> 33:18.319
It's all part of the plan.

33:18.405 --> 33:25.752
This... I might not understand
how but I know why.

33:25.838 --> 33:28.797
I couldn't even convince
my own son.

33:28.915 --> 33:30.799
What makes you think
I can fix all this?

33:30.917 --> 33:33.802
Because together
with the Van Helsings

33:33.920 --> 33:36.388
we can find a way out of this.

33:36.498 --> 33:38.473
We can.

33:40.761 --> 33:41.893
Up ahead, boss.

33:42.003 --> 33:43.520
I see it.

33:44.023 --> 33:45.397
Stop short.

33:48.185 --> 33:49.776
It don't look good, boss.

33:49.862 --> 33:52.446
Weapons ready, we don't know
what we're walking into here.

33:52.773 --> 33:54.072
Aaron.

33:59.780 --> 34:00.412
God no.

34:00.563 --> 34:01.538
God no, no, no.

34:01.648 --> 34:02.122
Aaron.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.248
Hey, sir!

34:03.399 --> 34:03.915
Wait!

34:04.025 --> 34:04.708
No, no, no, no.

34:04.818 --> 34:06.334
He's down! He's down!

34:16.505 --> 34:17.888
Violet?

34:19.007 --> 34:20.515
Violet!

34:22.677 --> 34:24.061
[under his breath]
Aaron, no.

34:26.973 --> 34:28.899
No, no, no.

34:30.402 --> 34:31.943
Violet!

34:39.578 --> 34:40.160
They've moved on.

34:40.245 --> 34:41.870
Aaron!

34:42.915 --> 34:44.748
We gotta get back
to the vehicle.

34:46.326 --> 34:47.334
Come on, sir, let's go.

34:47.419 --> 34:49.294
We gotta move. Come on.

34:55.085 --> 34:56.301
Hopper!

35:05.220 --> 35:08.105
[gunshots]

35:12.727 --> 35:13.735
Don't move. Don't move.

35:13.854 --> 35:14.402
Lie still.

35:14.521 --> 35:15.737
Goddammit.

35:16.690 --> 35:17.038
Should have seen it.
Should have seen it.

35:20.953 --> 35:23.245
[gasps]

35:23.363 --> 35:26.498
See this through.
See this through.

35:26.649 --> 35:27.707
It's okay.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.793
Make the world right again.

35:31.037 --> 35:32.671
For everyone.

35:35.750 --> 35:38.343
The kid, he's a good kid.

35:38.494 --> 35:39.970
Yeah.

35:40.714 --> 35:43.098
He's a good kid.
Don't be too hard on him.

35:43.758 --> 35:44.724
Tell him.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.226
Tell him...

36:09.951 --> 36:12.419
You're gonna be ok.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.713
I can feel it.

36:14.864 --> 36:17.174
Just the change
starting to happen.

36:17.283 --> 36:19.009
I got to you as fast
as I could.

36:19.118 --> 36:21.219
Before it took hold.

36:22.339 --> 36:25.599
Now I know what my Dad
went through for years.

36:29.855 --> 36:34.357
Those coordinates should be
right... here.

36:35.477 --> 36:36.026
<i> Violet: Aaron!</i>

36:36.135 --> 36:37.527
<i> Aaron, wait!</i>

36:49.199 --> 36:50.207
Hold on!

36:50.492 --> 36:51.499
Aaron, wait!

36:54.829 --> 36:55.921
Aaron.

36:57.374 --> 36:58.798
Aaron, wait!

36:59.042 --> 37:00.383
Aaron, stop.

37:02.963 --> 37:04.387
I needed to do this.

37:04.497 --> 37:07.015
Aaron, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

37:11.554 --> 37:14.356
[flies buzzing]

37:15.058 --> 37:16.191
Argh!

37:27.362 --> 37:28.495
It's my fault, Aaron.

37:28.580 --> 37:32.499
I'm... I'm sorry.

37:34.202 --> 37:36.211
I'm so sorry.

37:37.247 --> 37:38.505
Oh, Dad.

37:39.582 --> 37:41.049
Dad, it's ok.

37:41.167 --> 37:42.008
Dad.

37:42.544 --> 37:44.552
Dad.

37:44.671 --> 37:45.804
Hey.

37:45.913 --> 37:48.723
You didn't do this, ok?

37:48.842 --> 37:51.226
Do you hear me?

37:51.344 --> 37:52.352
They did.

37:52.437 --> 37:54.271
Ok, them.

37:54.514 --> 37:57.023
Look at me.

37:57.109 --> 37:58.984
Dad, look at me!

38:01.113 --> 38:05.824
We have to make this matter, ok?

38:05.975 --> 38:08.576
They can't die for nothing.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.579
Oh, Dad.

38:12.282 --> 38:13.790
Ok?

38:15.460 --> 38:17.877
They can't have died
for nothing.

38:19.247 --> 38:24.509
[sobbing]

38:30.142 --> 38:33.476
I swear to you, son.

38:33.586 --> 38:35.312
We're gonna make this right.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.647
We're gonna make this right.

38:37.757 --> 38:39.274
You and me.

38:39.934 --> 38:41.067
Ok.

38:41.561 --> 38:42.694
And me.

38:43.313 --> 38:44.446
And me.

38:44.898 --> 38:46.281
And me.

38:55.992 --> 38:57.584
Where's Hopper?

39:05.168 --> 39:06.384
No.

39:06.795 --> 39:08.136
No.

39:09.130 --> 39:10.513
No.

39:11.174 --> 39:11.681
Dad.

39:11.791 --> 39:14.684
He saved my life, son.

39:14.794 --> 39:16.394
He did?

39:18.139 --> 39:22.025
[sobbing]

39:22.135 --> 39:24.861
I got you now, ok?

39:24.971 --> 39:26.529
You hear me?

39:27.982 --> 39:30.283
I got you now.

39:30.369 --> 39:34.829
[sobbing]

39:34.948 --> 39:37.957
I swore an oath

39:38.043 --> 39:43.296
to preserve, protect,
and defend this country.

39:43.382 --> 39:47.133
And I'll be      damned
if I don't see that through.

39:52.048 --> 39:56.017
For mom and Tina.

39:56.136 --> 39:59.145
And Hopper.

39:59.231 --> 40:01.189
For all of them.

40:01.307 --> 40:02.524
Every victim.

40:02.642 --> 40:05.068
Every single one.

40:07.021 --> 40:09.114
What do you say, son?

40:09.574 --> 40:12.659
Maybe it's time to take
America back, hmm?

40:32.505 --> 40:33.805
So what's the plan?

40:35.341 --> 40:37.767
Find those coyote tunnels
Hopper was talking about,

40:37.877 --> 40:40.103
get across the wall.

40:40.213 --> 40:41.938
Maybe we should go back
to the compound,

40:42.048 --> 40:44.274
gather some supplies.

40:44.383 --> 40:46.443
Not right now.

40:46.552 --> 40:50.155
Let's get these guys home,
keep them safe for now.

40:59.699 --> 41:02.792
You're not taking me with you,
are you?

41:02.902 --> 41:05.003
We need you alive, sir.

41:05.154 --> 41:06.254
There's no point
in risking you

41:07.240 --> 41:08.089
when we don't know what
we're walking into.

41:09.301 --> 41:13.803
So your plan is you're gonna
take the White House by force?

41:13.913 --> 41:16.264
You understand how impossible
that is, right?

41:16.382 --> 41:17.098
Yeah.

41:19.052 --> 41:21.311
Gonna do it anyway.

41:29.896 --> 41:32.947
Maybe there's a chance I can
help you even the odds.

41:38.404 --> 41:39.370
<i> President Park: General.</i>

41:41.115 --> 41:43.374
<i> General Lannister,</i>
<i> are you there?</i>

41:43.526 --> 41:44.792
<i> Henry, it's me.</i>

41:44.911 --> 41:48.004
It's Davis Park.

41:48.114 --> 41:50.173
I think you and I need to talk.

41:50.283 --> 41:52.050
<i> President Park is dead.</i>

41:52.159 --> 41:54.552
How did you hack this line?

41:54.754 --> 41:55.845
<i> Listen, go ahead.</i>

41:55.955 --> 41:57.388
Track the call, fire a missile
at these coordinates,

41:57.498 --> 41:58.139
I wouldn't blame you.

41:58.258 --> 42:00.558
But tell me this.

42:01.761 --> 42:03.019
If I really was a vampire
would I know about that 50 bucks

42:04.205 --> 42:06.898
<i> you still owe me from poker</i>
<i> at Camp David?</i>

42:07.049 --> 42:09.234
<i> I hope Sam and Sally are ok.</i>

42:10.436 --> 42:14.572
<i>That you kept them save through-</i>
<i> through all this.</i>

42:16.317 --> 42:18.535
I've still got Aaron with me.

42:19.946 --> 42:21.746
We both survived.

42:23.116 --> 42:25.416
Even if you are who you say,

42:25.526 --> 42:27.752
you're not the one I take orders
from anymore.

42:27.903 --> 42:29.879
<i> Yeah, about that.</i>

42:29.989 --> 42:32.048
<i> There are things you need</i>
<i> to know, General.</i>

42:32.158 --> 42:35.343
Truths that are gonna make
a big difference.

42:35.461 --> 42:38.054
Don't you think you at least owe
me the chance to lay it all out

42:38.164 --> 42:40.848
before you blow me sky high?

42:43.678 --> 42:45.103
Hank.
