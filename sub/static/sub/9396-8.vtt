WEBVTT

00:00.562 --> 00:01.890
Previously on One Tree Hill.

00:01.952 --> 00:05.551
Okay, could it get any worse? My love life is non-existent,

00:05.602 --> 00:07.943
my parents are having a yard sale to sell everything we own.

00:08.013 --> 00:10.693
Being poor and horny is no way to go through life.

00:10.769 --> 00:12.890
- I’m Anna. 
- You’re Felix’s sister right?

00:12.957 --> 00:15.347
You know, I was thinking about this whole ‘Friends with Benefits’.

00:15.408 --> 00:17.681
Felix with Brooke. FWB.

00:17.799 --> 00:18.551
Come here.

00:18.659 --> 00:22.806
Dan has a… heart condition known as HCM. It’s a… genetic mutation.

00:22.867 --> 00:24.757
So what do you say boyfriend? Wanna sleep over?

00:29.315 --> 00:32.692
You have any idea how many guys in the room wanna nail your wife right now?

00:34.727 --> 00:37.670
Relax, it’s cool. Peyton and I did a couple lines the other night.

00:37.854 --> 00:38.904
Aint that right Peyton?

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

01:24.520 --> 01:28.380
Someone once said; it’s the good girls who keep diaries.

01:28.758 --> 01:30.700
The bad girls never have the time.

01:31.733 --> 01:34.632
Me… I just wanna live a life I’m gonna remember.

01:35.213 --> 01:36.924
Even if I don’t write it down.

01:38.363 --> 01:41.313
If I’d known your mom was gonna come home, I never would have stayed the night.

01:41.506 --> 01:44.202
I mean, not that I’m complaining but since when do you spend the night?

01:44.307 --> 01:47.872
That was a onetime only bonus for you getting me home from the club. Now come here.

01:49.136 --> 01:50.411
Where the hell is my bed?!

01:54.118 --> 01:59.028
Got a good price on the queen-size. Single bed on its way love mom?!

02:00.037 --> 02:02.146
I still live here, you know!

02:02.694 --> 02:03.457
You know....

02:04.701 --> 02:06.621
we could always shag on the shag.

02:07.645 --> 02:10.973
Moments past Pool Boy. Besides, I have to meet Haley.

02:18.141 --> 02:21.432
Gotta say, good call Nate. Road tripping to Charlotte.

02:21.530 --> 02:22.898
Love that NBA expansion.

02:24.761 --> 02:27.347
Third row, floor, right behind the bench.

02:30.399 --> 02:33.219
Anyway, so you take the CD’s that you’re sick of or never should have bought

02:33.265 --> 02:35.243
in the first place and you bring them back and they –

02:35.298 --> 02:36.737
- And they give me cash?
- Yeah.

02:37.055 --> 02:38.652
Maybe I can buy my bed back.

02:40.091 --> 02:42.078
So, Nathan’s going to Charlotte tonight with Lucas

02:42.184 --> 02:44.478
and this is my first night alone in the apartment.

02:45.150 --> 02:46.976
Do you know what we should do? We should have a slumber party.

02:47.058 --> 02:49.122
Seriously, we haven’t done that since like, junior high.

02:49.516 --> 02:52.313
I dunno. I haven’t done that since… ever.

02:52.772 --> 02:54.750
- Haley!
- I wasn’t popular in junior high.

02:54.872 --> 02:57.744
No! Then we have to. This is like a rite of passage.

02:57.847 --> 03:00.699
I mean, when did you learn to put on eye shadow and stuff your bra and make out?

03:00.797 --> 03:01.722
I don’t know.

03:01.861 --> 03:03.711
Okay, I’m calling Peyton. This is going to be great.

03:03.797 --> 03:06.126
Well, look I was kinda looking forward to having a night alone in the apartment.

03:06.208 --> 03:09.177
And I was kinda looking forward to being rich but we all adjust don’t we?

03:11.402 --> 03:12.578
- Hey, what’s up?
- Hey.

03:13.462 --> 03:14.497
Alright, what you got?

03:15.224 --> 03:16.032
Here you go.

03:17.584 --> 03:18.260
Alright.

03:18.793 --> 03:22.945
Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.565
Lucky for you, crap sells.

03:28.060 --> 03:29.350
D'ya listen to my demo yet?

03:29.668 --> 03:31.455
Um… yeah I did. It’s...

03:31.515 --> 03:35.556
Good; I know. I’m working on this other song I could really use some female vocals on.

03:35.669 --> 03:37.824
Maybe you could come by the studio and lay something down for me.

03:38.485 --> 03:40.447
Track. Lay down the track.

03:40.610 --> 03:41.300
Yeah.

03:42.985 --> 03:45.032
Okay. Yeah… sure.

03:45.131 --> 03:46.856
- That sounds fine. How’s – 
- Tonight.

03:47.643 --> 03:48.935
Let me get you the address.

03:49.959 --> 03:52.371
Hello. Tonight, slumber party.

03:52.473 --> 03:55.028
Oh, I’m sorry. Um… I can say no.

03:55.227 --> 03:57.168
No. It’s fine.

03:57.269 --> 03:58.678
I’ll come over early and set up.

03:58.770 --> 03:59.825
What do you mean ‘set up’?

04:00.583 --> 04:02.436
You have no idea.

04:10.060 --> 04:11.100
Oh great.

04:13.017 --> 04:14.380
Hey. You’re awake.

04:16.870 --> 04:19.313
I… saw you were gone. I thought, maybe…

04:20.064 --> 04:21.611
maybe it was a one-night-stand.

04:26.621 --> 04:29.557
But it felt good. You can one-night-stand me anytime.

04:31.252 --> 04:32.071
Where’d you go?

04:33.340 --> 04:34.426
Breakfast.

04:34.682 --> 04:37.129
Ohhh. Well how’d you get back in? The door locks.

04:37.216 --> 04:38.681
I jimmied it with a credit card.

04:38.767 --> 04:39.971
I should be afraid, right?

04:42.475 --> 04:44.057
Ahh… chocolate croissants.

04:44.472 --> 04:46.023
Those are actually for me.

04:46.162 --> 04:47.257
Uh, there are two.

04:47.631 --> 04:50.555
I know. Energy bar’s for you.

04:50.754 --> 04:52.951
Trust me you’re gonna need it.

04:59.346 --> 05:02.181
Oh hey! You look beat.

05:02.275 --> 05:05.571
Oh, I was up all night. First college paper.

05:06.047 --> 05:08.367
What are you doing here? Go home. Sleep.

05:08.439 --> 05:10.056
- We need to talk.
- Okay.

05:10.831 --> 05:12.499
Haley told me about the drugs.

05:18.587 --> 05:19.646
Opening night.

05:20.429 --> 05:22.580
This guy Rick was doing coke.

05:23.748 --> 05:26.425
Oh, uh… yeah.

05:26.668 --> 05:28.048
Why didn’t you tell me?

05:29.016 --> 05:31.786
I don’t know. I’m sorry.

05:32.190 --> 05:35.900
Look, I know he’s got a lotta music connections and I know how important that is to you.

05:36.012 --> 05:38.810
But I won’t have drugs in my club, Peyton!

05:38.888 --> 05:39.477
Of course.

05:39.544 --> 05:41.669
And I don’t expect you to handle everything on your own…

05:42.124 --> 05:45.961
but you have to come to me if… anything like that ever happens again.

05:48.106 --> 05:49.620
- I will.
- Promise?

05:50.343 --> 05:51.115
I promise.

05:51.591 --> 05:52.161
Good.

05:55.185 --> 05:56.874
You know you can always talk to me, Peyton.

06:07.642 --> 06:09.291
It’s another mechanic stripper!

06:10.274 --> 06:12.050
No… just Lucas.

06:12.210 --> 06:14.074
Okay! Guess we’re off.

06:14.227 --> 06:16.674
Alright! Well go… whoever they are!

06:16.797 --> 06:19.424
- Bobcats Haley.
- Alright, well, I love bobcats. They’re so cute.

06:19.491 --> 06:20.955
- You’re such a girl.
- I know.

06:22.624 --> 06:25.742
Can we go now? You saw her, she’s back, let’s go!

06:25.803 --> 06:29.531
Come on, man! Look, this is the first night we’ve spent apart since we got married.

06:32.305 --> 06:35.455
Well… girls are having a slumber party.

06:35.541 --> 06:36.135
Really?

06:36.330 --> 06:38.450
Oh, that’s cool. So you won’t be alone tonight.

06:38.527 --> 06:39.786
- Yep.
- What’re you gonna do until then?

06:40.718 --> 06:43.898
Uh… Probably just gonna… hang out with Brooke.

06:44.630 --> 06:45.546
Right Brooke?

06:46.796 --> 06:47.507
Yeah!

06:48.250 --> 06:49.735
Just us girls.

06:57.236 --> 07:00.230
So, find anything good in the lost and found?!

07:00.337 --> 07:01.172
Not really!

07:02.525 --> 07:03.247
Okay.

07:03.675 --> 07:06.580
How wasted does one have to be to go home with one shoe.

07:06.652 --> 07:09.841
It’s like, at what point do you look down at your foot and say ‘hmmm’.

07:09.943 --> 07:12.823
Eww, I was thinking the same thing about the two thongs in here.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.301
Eww, two thongs?!

07:14.694 --> 07:17.214
Now that is what I call a successful club opening.

07:20.286 --> 07:22.119
- Hello?!
- What’s so funny?

07:22.215 --> 07:24.863
Oh, hey Brooke. Are you missing any underwear?

07:24.950 --> 07:25.621
What!?

07:26.118 --> 07:28.974
Nothing. Anna’s just helping me clean out TRIC.

07:29.097 --> 07:30.326
Thanks for the phone call.

07:30.752 --> 07:33.025
What, did you really wanna get up and work this morning?

07:33.127 --> 07:34.170
Okay, good point.

07:34.279 --> 07:37.238
Well, tonight; Haley doesn’t have a husband, I don’t have a bed,

07:37.341 --> 07:38.722
so we’re having a slumber party.

07:38.843 --> 07:40.110
Oh, how retro.

07:40.205 --> 07:43.842
I know! You bring the music and your ouija board, I’m bringing the beauty arsenal.

07:44.032 --> 07:46.127
How about Anna? Can I bring her too?

07:46.403 --> 07:47.776
Whatever. Nine o’clock.

07:55.445 --> 07:56.904
This car runs great, man.

07:57.723 --> 07:59.008
Yeah, not bad right?

07:59.485 --> 08:02.223
The best part is; Dan had nothing to do with it.

08:04.462 --> 08:07.831
- Do need to replace this tape deck though.
- Oh, god, definitely.

08:08.655 --> 08:13.421
But, for now, I got my… trusty IPod and cassette adaptor.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.706
Nice! Fire it up.

08:18.137 --> 08:19.770
- It’s stuck.
- What?

08:20.667 --> 08:23.027
You telling me you didn’t check the stereo before we left?

08:23.288 --> 08:24.918
I was busy working on the engine.

08:30.512 --> 08:31.608
A holiday,

08:33.352 --> 08:34.413
A holiday

08:35.263 --> 08:36.323
What is this?

08:36.416 --> 08:37.655
Is the best day,

08:37.726 --> 08:38.852
I have no idea.

08:39.462 --> 08:41.075
An ice-cream day,

08:42.361 --> 08:43.993
I am only happy,

08:45.366 --> 08:46.702
When I have,

08:47.812 --> 08:49.031
A holi-

08:51.443 --> 08:54.474
- I thought I was gonna have to fail you.
- I know. It’s been one of those days.

08:55.042 --> 08:55.786
You’re flushed.

08:55.872 --> 08:57.439
Well I ran all the way form the parking lot.

08:58.044 --> 08:59.942
And um… I’m a little nervous.

09:00.577 --> 09:01.377
Bout the paper?

09:01.713 --> 09:02.538
That too.

09:10.107 --> 09:11.881
Well look, the paper’s in now.

09:11.985 --> 09:15.314
So um… how bout dinner tonight? I know this great place.

09:15.707 --> 09:18.559
- And we past the hotdog stage.
- I like the hotdog stage.

09:18.646 --> 09:20.089
I know. That’s why I liked you.

09:20.834 --> 09:22.399
I’m ready for an upgrade if you are.

09:23.679 --> 09:25.086
Okay, tonight.

09:26.013 --> 09:27.493
Good, so it’s a date then.

09:34.219 --> 09:35.194
Where did you come from?

09:38.123 --> 09:38.876
Me?

09:39.289 --> 09:40.116
Yeah.

09:40.458 --> 09:41.097
Durham.

09:42.342 --> 09:44.165
Got a husband and three kids there.

09:44.256 --> 09:45.224
No, I’m serious.

09:46.391 --> 09:47.844
We never talk about you.

09:48.829 --> 09:49.956
What can I say?

09:50.805 --> 09:52.140
I’m from the Midwest,

09:53.084 --> 09:54.666
I like my parents,

09:55.464 --> 09:58.423
I sell real-estate now and again and…

09:59.085 --> 10:01.598
oh, I have terrible taste in guys.

10:04.460 --> 10:08.556
There is… one thing you should know about me though.

10:09.991 --> 10:11.204
Very important.

10:12.987 --> 10:13.790
Okay.

10:15.129 --> 10:16.544
I’m starving!

10:26.190 --> 10:27.675
Okay, that’s weird.

10:28.236 --> 10:28.934
Haley?!

10:32.826 --> 10:33.983
Oh my god!

10:46.495 --> 10:49.306
Okay, I think you should know I have a bat.

10:49.666 --> 10:51.559
And, we dialled 911.

10:53.608 --> 10:54.724
Yeah, that too.

11:05.721 --> 11:08.132
Okay, on the count of three.

11:08.926 --> 11:11.636
One… two… three!

11:14.864 --> 11:16.075
- Brooke!
- Peyton!

11:16.167 --> 11:19.428
- Anna!
- Argh, my eyes! I’m blind!

11:31.445 --> 11:33.462
Hey, I’m looking for Karen.

11:33.580 --> 11:34.481
That’s me.

11:36.032 --> 11:38.797
- You’re Rick.
- Yeah, what can I do for you?

11:40.206 --> 11:42.033
You could stay the hell away from TRIC.

11:43.063 --> 11:44.322
You’re not welcome here.

11:45.048 --> 11:46.927
I won’t have drugs in my club.

11:47.010 --> 11:49.028
Yeah, well you won’t have any customers either.

11:50.118 --> 11:52.155
I control every major band on this circuit.

11:52.718 --> 11:54.853
You cut me off, you’re cutting off your talent.

11:54.930 --> 11:56.005
We’ll be fine!

11:56.507 --> 12:00.178
And by the way, the place was full of kids. What’s wrong with you?

12:02.621 --> 12:03.962
Dumb move lady.

12:05.857 --> 12:08.442
Actually, it’s the smartest move I’ve made all day.

12:14.645 --> 12:18.632
What do you want from me? Okay, I have no bed and rope burns are so last season.

12:18.712 --> 12:23.106
I don’t know Brooke; backseats, hot tubs, closets. You’ve never had a problem before.

12:23.192 --> 12:24.819
We were horny okay?

12:26.007 --> 12:28.104
Just promise me you won’t tell Haley.

12:28.186 --> 12:30.883
- You are so washing the sheets.
- Yeah!

12:31.672 --> 12:37.228
- Okay, who saw me naked?
- I said ew! Sister in the room, hello!

12:38.539 --> 12:42.450
Huh, hey, is this gonna work for me? You know, coz I got that combination skin.

12:42.542 --> 12:44.247
You have to go! Go!

12:44.345 --> 12:47.180
Hey, whatever you say. Just give me a second to get my stuff.

12:52.097 --> 12:55.747
Hi! I’m Brooke. We haven’t officially been introduced…

12:55.849 --> 12:58.793
but you’re dating my ex boyfriend and I’m sleeping with your brother

12:58.879 --> 13:01.762
- so it looks like we have a lot in common.
- Yeah.

13:02.029 --> 13:02.660
Brooke!

13:02.756 --> 13:04.738
Oh, and you’re Peyton’s new best friend.

13:05.627 --> 13:07.574
Sorry, I forgot that part.

13:11.675 --> 13:13.058
Is that the shower?

13:14.004 --> 13:15.162
Unbelievable!

13:15.426 --> 13:19.135
Oo, that water is hot and so is Felix,

13:19.974 --> 13:23.021
Oo, the water is wet and so is –

13:31.470 --> 13:35.955
Dancing when the stars go blue,

13:36.374 --> 13:41.024
Dancing where the evening fell,

13:41.571 --> 13:45.822
Dancing in my wooden shoes,

13:45.949 --> 13:48.642
- In a wedding go –
- Alright Haley, hold up.

13:49.133 --> 13:50.270
I’m just not feeling it.

13:51.146 --> 13:52.498
Hold up a second okay?

13:55.319 --> 13:56.634
Alright Haley, listen.

13:57.396 --> 13:59.568
A lot of girls can see on-key okay?

14:00.029 --> 14:02.032
I’m gonna need something a little bit more from you alright?

14:02.113 --> 14:05.338
Something… a bit further south than your brain. You know what I saying?

14:05.426 --> 14:09.251
Listen, it’s not about technique. It’s about giving me something of yourself.

14:09.369 --> 14:11.350
Something that no one else gets to see.

14:12.379 --> 14:14.724
You can’t play it safe in here Haley, I’m not gonna let you.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.521
- Okay, well, I’m trying.
- No you’re not!

14:16.603 --> 14:19.164
- Yes I am!
- No you’re not, you’re really close to something.

14:19.251 --> 14:22.374
You know, and you’ve got the talent but for some reason, you won’t go there.

14:24.001 --> 14:28.119
If you won’t go there, maybe you’re just wasting my time.

14:33.117 --> 14:33.766
Okay.

14:34.667 --> 14:35.451
Come here.

14:37.616 --> 14:40.289
Play it back. Put me in this time.

14:41.896 --> 14:43.208
Just follow along okay?

14:43.980 --> 14:44.721
Okay

14:49.706 --> 14:53.847
Laughing with your pretty mouth,

14:54.107 --> 14:58.751
- Try this one now.
- Laughing with your broken eyes,

14:58.895 --> 15:04.117
Okay, yeah. 
Laughing with your lovers song,

15:04.307 --> 15:07.932
In a lullaby,

15:08.924 --> 15:10.471
Alright, now sing with me on this one Hale.

15:11.582 --> 15:15.766
Where do you go when you’re lonely,

15:16.583 --> 15:20.987
Where do you go when you’re blue.

15:22.003 --> 15:26.036
Where do you go when you’re lonely,

15:27.085 --> 15:32.011
Where do you go when you’re blue,

15:32.207 --> 15:37.869
Where do you go when you’re lonely,
I’ll follow you,

15:38.145 --> 15:41.075
Follow you...

15:53.577 --> 15:55.715
What the hell is Felix doing in there?

15:55.839 --> 15:57.252
I dunno. Shaving?

15:57.346 --> 16:00.156
What, his legs? He’s been in there forever.

16:00.239 --> 16:02.681
Yeah, cos your look is so wash and go.

16:04.996 --> 16:07.371
- Hey you guys.
- Oh! Haley!

16:07.468 --> 16:08.072
Hi.

16:08.189 --> 16:08.932
Smells good.

16:09.096 --> 16:09.972
Where you been?

16:10.304 --> 16:12.081
Nowhere, I’m just gonna go take a shower.

16:13.372 --> 16:14.098
Haley?!

16:17.008 --> 16:17.790
What?

16:23.120 --> 16:25.823
Ahh… I love slumber parties.

16:35.073 --> 16:37.471
I’m not always late. I promise.

16:37.542 --> 16:39.565
No worries. You’re worth the wait.

16:39.636 --> 16:40.410
Thank you.

16:42.863 --> 16:43.728
Keith!

16:45.807 --> 16:46.672
Karen.

16:51.714 --> 16:52.917
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:56.501 --> 16:59.231
So… this sucks, huh?

17:01.313 --> 17:03.072
What the hell, I got first round.

17:03.181 --> 17:04.484
- Drinks?
- Yes!

17:06.809 --> 17:07.710
Yeah.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.529
Charlotte Bobcats, here we come.

18:08.844 --> 18:10.138
That could be you someday.

18:10.692 --> 18:14.153
Well… actually, it could be me. You’re not good enough.

18:20.108 --> 18:21.213
D’you see that?!

18:30.118 --> 18:33.911
You know, I’m just not clear on this. So the shower at your house is broken

18:34.029 --> 18:36.840
and you had to have Felix come all the way over here and use mine?

18:38.980 --> 18:39.737
Brooke!

18:42.357 --> 18:45.332
Wait a second. You don’t have a bed do you?

18:45.467 --> 18:49.169
Did you… Tell me you didn’t have sex in my bed. Brooke.

18:49.732 --> 18:53.049
- I’m already washing your sheets.
- Oh my god! Eurgh! Brooke! Eurgh!

18:53.168 --> 18:55.098
They already yelled at me, what is the big deal?!

18:55.191 --> 18:58.319
The big deal is that first of all; you did not thank me for helping you with the CDs.

18:58.431 --> 19:02.793
Second of all; you had sex in my bed! And third; you ate all the brownies.

19:02.895 --> 19:05.318
- Actually, I had a couple.
- That’s not the point.

19:06.207 --> 19:09.014
Haley’s right. The point id that I’ve been deceptive.

19:09.117 --> 19:12.028
It’s not so much that… I lied to anyone’s face.

19:12.460 --> 19:14.206
It’s more about what I didn’t say.

19:15.350 --> 19:20.187
Urgh! Okay. There is a big difference between a lie and a little white lie.

19:20.350 --> 19:21.251
- Really!
- Yeah!

19:21.390 --> 19:23.520
- Okay, wait, what white lie?
- Nothing!

19:23.664 --> 19:25.644
- Haley lied to Nathan!
- Not exactly!

19:25.741 --> 19:27.128
- Yes you did!
- About what?!

19:27.252 --> 19:28.393
- Nothing.
- Haley.

19:28.501 --> 19:32.245
You know what, if we’re talking about bad behaviour, you might wanna sit this one out!

19:32.582 --> 19:34.246
What is that supposed to mean?

19:34.333 --> 19:36.724
That’s supposed to mean that Peyton’s the one you should be looking at, not me.

19:36.801 --> 19:39.882
Why?! She not the one acting like a perfect-little-Stepford-wife!

19:39.981 --> 19:43.128
Why are you picking on Haley? She’s throwing us a slumber party.

19:43.232 --> 19:47.072
Actually, she was throwing us a slumber party, you just butted in!

19:47.165 --> 19:48.618
- Brooke! Leave her alone!
- Why!?

19:48.689 --> 19:49.944
What’re you gonna do? Snort her?

19:50.051 --> 19:53.652
Listen, I didn’t throw this slumber party for you, you threw it for yourself and you know it!

19:53.739 --> 19:58.653
Well, at least I didn’t lie to my husband about hanging out with Chris!

19:58.750 --> 20:01.433
Brooke, well… Peyton did cocaine with that Rick guy.

20:01.499 --> 20:02.339
- Haley!
- What?!

20:02.432 --> 20:04.613
- You had sex in her bed!
- Okay...

20:04.690 --> 20:06.671
What is wrong with you!? Crack whore!

20:06.779 --> 20:07.471
Slut!

20:07.756 --> 20:08.468
Liar!

20:11.081 --> 20:14.178
Man, Tree Hill’s got some drama.

20:20.788 --> 20:23.363
- That was awesome.
- Yeah. It was man.

20:24.338 --> 20:28.160
You know, if you want to drive back tonight man, I’m so wired I’m not gonna go to sleep for hours.

20:28.360 --> 20:29.911
No, nah it’s cool.

20:30.279 --> 20:32.716
Oh come on. You can see Hales, I can…

20:33.397 --> 20:34.786
crash the slumber party.

20:35.333 --> 20:37.310
Nah, we can’t. Gotta stay the night.

20:38.595 --> 20:41.606
Okay. Why?

20:41.704 --> 20:43.178
This trip wasn’t just about the game.

20:44.672 --> 20:45.773
There’s something else.

20:54.539 --> 20:55.798
Sorry about dinner.

20:56.029 --> 20:59.817
Oh please. I’m hoping to break bread with all your ex boyfriends.

21:00.877 --> 21:02.392
He wasn’t my boyfriend.

21:03.745 --> 21:06.431
And yet he asked you to marry him. Interesting.

21:06.842 --> 21:08.936
- Seems like a nice guy though.
- He is.

21:14.287 --> 21:16.749
- You like?
- What’s not to like?

21:17.712 --> 21:19.406
You know, I have this print too.

21:21.501 --> 21:22.561
It’s not a print.

21:27.788 --> 21:29.974
Well, I feel like I’m back in Italy.

21:30.092 --> 21:30.820
Yeah.

21:31.864 --> 21:33.471
I have a house there too. You wanna go?

21:33.847 --> 21:35.053
I could blow off school for a week.

21:36.430 --> 21:37.588
Or not!

21:38.873 --> 21:41.387
- Is it my company?
- Oh, no, god it’s the paper.

21:41.555 --> 21:43.574
I… kinda pulled an all-nighter.

21:43.697 --> 21:44.946
Spoken like a true co-ed.

21:46.763 --> 21:48.770
Since you mentioned it though, come here.

21:56.303 --> 21:58.289
Let’s just take care of this right now shall we?

21:58.636 --> 21:59.670
Oh boy!

22:02.133 --> 22:04.391
Let’s see... right.

22:14.728 --> 22:15.896
Congratulations.

22:23.447 --> 22:26.755
You need more wine. Stay put, get comfortable.

22:27.335 --> 22:29.152
You know, I think I should probably go.

22:31.323 --> 22:32.091
Why?

22:35.514 --> 22:36.523
I just…

22:41.773 --> 22:42.648
Karen!

22:45.341 --> 22:46.852
You know about Dan’s heart condition.

22:47.497 --> 22:50.134
It’s called HCM and it’s genetic.

22:51.578 --> 22:53.508
- Which means we might have it.
- Yeah.

22:53.862 --> 22:57.175
This is serious Luke. It’s common among athletes too.

22:59.503 --> 23:00.446
What do we do?

23:00.994 --> 23:03.600
Well, first of all; if we have it, that’s it for basketball.

23:04.312 --> 23:05.734
Or any sport really.

23:06.570 --> 23:08.279
But what does this have to do with Charlotte?

23:08.571 --> 23:10.440
Well the test costs a thousand bucks.

23:11.028 --> 23:14.455
There’s a hospital here that does free student-athlete screenings once a month.

23:15.863 --> 23:16.917
And that’s tomorrow.

23:17.573 --> 23:19.201
And why didn’t you tell me about this upfront?

23:19.487 --> 23:22.498
I dunno, I… I didn’t wanna ruin it;

23:22.775 --> 23:25.821
the game, the road trip… us hanging out.

23:29.251 --> 23:30.925
We have appointments tomorrow morning.

23:31.037 --> 23:33.337
Ah, come on man, what are the odds of us even having this thing anyway?

23:34.720 --> 23:35.875
Fifty-fifty.

23:39.166 --> 23:40.469
One in two.

24:09.037 --> 24:11.989
I’m sorry I freaked out on you about the bed. At least I have one.

24:13.749 --> 24:15.480
I’m sorry I called you a liar.

24:16.392 --> 24:20.483
- You fibbed to Nathan; it’s not a big deal.
- No, it is a big deal.

24:22.516 --> 24:25.443
Okay, cease fire! Girl talk.

24:30.607 --> 24:31.475
Come on.

24:32.596 --> 24:35.602
I should have told Nathan that I was gonna be with Chris and I don’t know why I didn’t

24:35.668 --> 24:39.958
cos, like, the words started coming out of my mouth and then it was just… too late to take it back.

24:40.016 --> 24:42.278
Okay, you don’t have feeling for Chris, do you?

24:43.829 --> 24:46.902
No. It’s just the first time I’ve ever wanted something for me.

24:46.958 --> 24:49.205
It’s not for my parents, it’s not for Nathan, it’s just... for me

24:49.272 --> 24:51.801
and Chris can… help me get it.

24:52.743 --> 24:54.910
- So… what’s wrong with that?
- Exactly!

24:54.981 --> 24:57.587
I don’t know why I should feel embarrassed for saying

24:57.654 --> 25:00.213
that I know what I want and I’m gonna go after it like…

25:01.146 --> 25:02.308
Like a guy.

25:04.991 --> 25:08.544
Nathan never apologises or… or lies for what he wants. I mean…

25:09.809 --> 25:11.494
I don’t know why I feel like I had to.

25:11.595 --> 25:15.871
Haley, trust me, you can go after what you want and still be a girl.

25:15.968 --> 25:20.012
I know. I totally know and that why this is so stupid!

25:22.517 --> 25:24.156
On the topic of stupid,

25:26.955 --> 25:30.258
- cocaine, P. Sawyer?
- I’m an idiot.

25:31.780 --> 25:34.406
- Well you’re not gonna do it again, right?
- No! No.

25:34.537 --> 25:38.589
Um… I don’t want to. But…

25:43.407 --> 25:44.947
I’m not going to.

25:45.506 --> 25:46.370
Okay.

25:50.416 --> 25:53.565
I’m really sorry. Sorry I just blurted that out. I…

25:54.246 --> 25:56.811
I should have talked to you about it at the club but I just…

25:57.195 --> 25:58.643
I just didn’t wanna handle it.

25:58.726 --> 26:02.037
No. It’s… It’s my fault.

26:02.565 --> 26:08.403
But I just… really want us all to be… good enough friends that we can talk about stuff.

26:08.796 --> 26:12.033
You know? Even when it’s ugly…

26:13.108 --> 26:14.282
especially then.

26:27.532 --> 26:31.714
So just like that? Get the test, find out we can never play again.

26:31.776 --> 26:32.579
Yep.

26:34.945 --> 26:35.698
What?

26:36.117 --> 26:37.540
It’s just Dan! You know?!

26:37.983 --> 26:41.146
Oh, tell me about it. I can emancipate myself all I want

26:41.237 --> 26:43.653
but… the guy still finds a way to control my life.

26:44.945 --> 26:47.863
- Hey, Emeka, you played a great game man.
- Thanks.

26:48.500 --> 26:52.220
So, how does it feel to be out there? You know, finally making it to the league.

26:53.060 --> 26:56.557
It was a dream-come-true. What I was born to do. You guys play?

26:57.494 --> 26:58.287
Yeah.

26:59.573 --> 27:00.427
We love it.

27:00.576 --> 27:02.834
You gotta bulk up a little bit if you wanna play in the league.

27:03.203 --> 27:04.221
Yeah, he’s skinny.

27:04.986 --> 27:06.171
You too.

27:08.337 --> 27:09.485
Yeah, well he’s got no left.

27:10.632 --> 27:12.199
- You got no range.
- What?!

27:12.808 --> 27:14.452
Please tell me you guys aren’t team mates.

27:15.757 --> 27:17.442
Nah, it’s worse; we’re brothers.

27:18.024 --> 27:21.962
Right, well, you guys… roll strong and hit those weights.

27:22.043 --> 27:22.869
Thanks man.

27:25.532 --> 27:29.954
Okay, so… are we going to talk about your little ‘arrangement’ with Felix?

27:30.046 --> 27:31.619
The ‘Friends with Benefits’ thing.

27:31.824 --> 27:34.603
Do we have to? It’s kinda foul.

27:34.773 --> 27:39.192
What’s foul about it? I mean, besides… Haley’s linens.

27:40.774 --> 27:42.248
- Come on!
- Sorry!

27:42.366 --> 27:46.420
No. But seriously, like, I know you’re gonna give me your whole…

27:46.510 --> 27:50.573
‘I can have sex like a guy’ speech but… its crap.

27:50.743 --> 27:53.071
Why? You think I’m gonna let myself get hurt again?

27:53.169 --> 27:54.259
I dunno, maybe.

27:54.634 --> 27:56.569
At least I’m having sex. I d-

27:56.717 --> 28:00.915
Yeah, with a guy that doesn’t even respect you enough to have a real relationship with you.

28:01.002 --> 28:06.004
Anna, I’m… I’m really sorry, okay, but everything is on Felix’s terms.

28:06.097 --> 28:09.569
- I gave him the Writer so they’re my terms.
- But it was his idea!

28:09.728 --> 28:14.473
- Brooke? Don’t you wanna fall in love?
- Yeah, I do. Some day, okay?

28:15.196 --> 28:16.343
Why not now?

28:18.554 --> 28:21.252
Look, Tutor Wife, I love you but if it was up to you,

28:21.319 --> 28:24.068
we’d all be getting our marriage licence with our drivers licence and I-

28:24.181 --> 28:28.236
I’m not talking about marriage. I’m just talking about… falling in love.

28:28.313 --> 28:31.948
And I’m tired of feeling bad! Okay?

28:32.051 --> 28:35.097
I’d rather feel nothing. It’s… better, it’s easier.

28:35.174 --> 28:40.252
No. It is not better Brooke! Like… it’s not you!

28:40.443 --> 28:44.169
Okay, I admire you so much for the chances you take

28:44.251 --> 28:46.668
but… this just doesn’t seem like you.

28:47.661 --> 28:51.015
- It’s less than you.
- It’s just about sex-

28:51.097 --> 28:55.842
Okay, we both know… sex is never just sex.

28:55.916 --> 28:59.361
I love my brother but there is a double standard for girls and there always will be.

28:59.459 --> 29:01.680
Yeah, and I’m saying screw the double standard!

29:01.778 --> 29:03.488
That’s good Brooke. You should say it.

29:03.601 --> 29:08.193
And so should I and every other girl who is tired of playing their game… by their rules.

29:08.372 --> 29:12.207
Don’t be too fat… or too thin or too… dark

29:12.301 --> 29:15.761
or too light… don’t be too sexual or too chased

29:15.827 --> 29:17.610
or too smart or too dumb!

29:17.869 --> 29:20.471
Be yourself. But make sure you fit in.

29:35.570 --> 29:38.252
- Hello?
- Whatever I did, I’m sorry.

29:39.324 --> 29:43.026
Look, Andy, I’m exhausted and I don’t wanna say something I might regret.

29:43.163 --> 29:45.385
Obviously I already have. Let me come over.

29:45.467 --> 29:49.583
No! It’s late and by the time you get here… No.

29:57.403 --> 30:01.350
Now I’ve been trying to figure out what happened and, I’ve narrowed it down to, like, this paper or…

30:01.426 --> 30:04.448
I don’t know; you’re psychotic or something. And I don’t think you’re psychotic.

30:05.825 --> 30:08.815
You didn’t even read it and you gave me an ‘A’! In your bedroom!

30:08.891 --> 30:09.570
I did read it.

30:09.645 --> 30:11.222
Then you should know it doesn’t deserve an ‘A’!

30:11.303 --> 30:14.175
I mean, I banged this out in one night; it is practically my first draft!

30:14.251 --> 30:18.325
- Karen!
- Look, Andy, this is important to me!

30:18.742 --> 30:20.095
Going to school,

30:21.307 --> 30:25.685
and I have to know that I can do this and I’m not gonna compromise it by seeing you. I can’t!

30:25.869 --> 30:27.836
Your paper is good Karen!

30:28.143 --> 30:31.825
And you instincts are great! Okay, so maybe you haven’t memorised every stupid text book principle

30:31.875 --> 30:35.829
but you already… have two successful businesses up and running, right now.

30:35.906 --> 30:38.097
Yeah, but I was rushed, I was distracted!

30:38.173 --> 30:40.272
Okay, so maybe it isn’t gonna be as hard as you think.

30:40.477 --> 30:44.746
Maybe being a mom and a business woman has prepared you for this in ways that you don’t even recognise.

30:44.819 --> 30:48.106
And maybe… maybe you just need to have a bit more confidence.

30:50.441 --> 30:52.596
In yourself… and in me.

30:56.032 --> 30:59.033
Now I’ll have one of my colleagues grade that paper if that’s what you want.

30:59.437 --> 31:01.162
But you deserve that ‘A’ Karen.

31:02.606 --> 31:05.023
And I know how important that is to you, I know.

31:05.893 --> 31:08.433
I would never do anything to compromise that.

31:16.010 --> 31:18.392
- Lucas home?
- No, he’s in Charlotte for the night.

31:19.752 --> 31:22.476
- Where’s this print of yours?
- It’s in my bedroom, it’s in my bedroom.

31:26.664 --> 31:27.848
Some night, huh?

31:28.228 --> 31:29.818
It was pretty great wasn’t it?

31:29.978 --> 31:31.298
No, it was awful.

31:33.204 --> 31:35.723
But… somehow, with you it wasn’t so awful.

31:36.126 --> 31:38.022
Aw, you’re such a sweetie.

31:38.838 --> 31:42.915
I just… I feel so much better… lighter somehow.

31:42.988 --> 31:45.086
Good. Cos you’re gonna need room…

31:45.507 --> 31:48.446
for my strawberry ice-cream and coco pebbles.

31:48.619 --> 31:49.458
Yikes.

31:52.193 --> 31:56.715
Okay, I’ve never had a problem that ice-cream couldn’t solve, and I’ve had some problems.

31:57.533 --> 32:02.945
Okay, I’ve never had a slumber party so I’m gonna say this sob-fest is over!

32:03.027 --> 32:04.256
Alright, we’ll see, what d’ya wanna do?

32:05.100 --> 32:06.176
Pillow fight!

32:06.520 --> 32:08.224
Oh, it is on now!

32:20.973 --> 32:22.253
Oh, my head!

32:26.642 --> 32:28.535
Oh my… god!

32:42.585 --> 32:43.491
Sleeping?

32:44.371 --> 32:45.191
No.

32:46.911 --> 32:48.309
I keep thinking about Haley.

32:50.158 --> 32:51.898
She must be scared about all this.

32:53.736 --> 32:55.081
I haven’t told her yet.

32:57.801 --> 33:00.597
Till I get the test results and figure out what I’m gonna do…

33:01.231 --> 33:02.389
I wanna protect her.

33:02.742 --> 33:04.514
She’ll probably be pissed about that but…

33:05.302 --> 33:06.675
I think it’s for the best.

33:16.310 --> 33:19.183
We’ll do this first, then you go for the blood test. Just relax.

33:20.450 --> 33:21.472
You okay?

33:21.958 --> 33:23.177
Yeah, you?

33:23.811 --> 33:27.042
Yeah, just… thinking about my life.

33:27.375 --> 33:29.684
Basketball’s such a… big part Nate. I…

33:31.706 --> 33:33.084
I don’t wanna give it up.

33:34.327 --> 33:36.366
I felt the same way before I got married.

33:38.056 --> 33:41.676
Basketball was the most important thing to me… it was the only thing.

33:42.509 --> 33:43.617
But now Haley is.

33:45.121 --> 33:46.748
And I owe it to her to find out.

33:47.733 --> 33:49.176
Okay, go ahead and lie back.

33:50.001 --> 33:50.821
You’re next.

34:00.532 --> 34:01.633
I’m sorry…

34:02.657 --> 34:03.891
I don’t wanna know.

34:20.719 --> 34:25.391
It’s a big risk, Luke, not taking this test. You know the odds.

34:26.266 --> 34:28.867
And what about the risk of never feeling alive again?

34:28.953 --> 34:30.935
As opposed to never being alive again?

34:33.873 --> 34:36.475
There’s more to life than sports. Trust me.

34:36.679 --> 34:40.929
After my accident I promised myself… I wouldn’t be afraid anymore.

34:42.793 --> 34:43.534
Of dying?

34:45.768 --> 34:48.034
Yeah! Dying…

34:49.080 --> 34:50.114
living too.

35:04.154 --> 35:06.366
Oh! I’m sorry.

35:06.785 --> 35:09.090
I’m not used to having someone else in my bed.

35:11.931 --> 35:12.709
Sleep well?

35:13.406 --> 35:14.405
Like a baby.

35:19.540 --> 35:20.379
What?

35:20.592 --> 35:24.676
I dunno, you just… you seemed more attractive last night.

35:24.916 --> 35:26.057
Huh, must have been the wine.

35:26.734 --> 35:28.183
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

35:28.279 --> 35:29.497
That’s too bad, you’re stuck with me.

35:29.731 --> 35:31.818
No, oh. Oh I hope so!

35:46.299 --> 35:48.340
Okay, stop thief.

35:50.188 --> 35:54.274
A thief break in to steal, I break in with treats.

35:55.503 --> 35:58.279
Well… I’ve got something for you too.

35:58.846 --> 36:00.085
I’m training you well.

36:07.796 --> 36:08.809
Wow, a key.

36:08.969 --> 36:13.540
You can use it to come see me, or… burgle the place, whatever.

36:14.789 --> 36:15.907
Big step!

36:16.540 --> 36:18.292
Oh well, it doesn’t have to mean anything.

36:18.569 --> 36:23.299
But it’ll keep my landlord from asking about the hot cat burglar who comes and goes.

36:23.592 --> 36:24.589
So to speak.

36:40.787 --> 36:43.560
Oh… my gosh!

36:44.599 --> 36:47.746
Urgh! Do you think there’s such a thing as a sugar hangover?

36:49.965 --> 36:53.200
I think what you need is a little taste of the snake that bit ya!

36:54.308 --> 36:56.857
- Ice-cream for breakfast?
- It’s Butter-pecan.

36:57.589 --> 36:58.448
Alright.

37:01.726 --> 37:04.879
So… weird night, huh?

37:05.540 --> 37:07.803
Actually… it was fun.

37:08.965 --> 37:10.492
Thanks for inviting me Peyton.

37:11.689 --> 37:14.899
I was really worried about not making any friends here, but…

37:15.345 --> 37:17.735
I think… I might have made some good ones.

37:20.164 --> 37:22.318
And, if you ever need someone to talk to...

37:22.856 --> 37:25.200
Thanks Anna. I’m glad you came.

37:29.001 --> 37:30.166
So, neighbour girl…

37:31.762 --> 37:34.509
Looks like we have a few things in common after all.

37:35.027 --> 37:36.987
I’m sorry I was kind of a witch before.

37:37.163 --> 37:41.063
It’s okay. It’s hard to let new people in sometimes. I’m used to it.

37:41.144 --> 37:45.103
Well, don’t get too used to it. You’re with us now.

37:54.349 --> 37:55.173
You’re a mess!

37:59.177 --> 38:03.028
I know you don’t understand what I’m doing, but I need to ask you a favour.

38:04.799 --> 38:05.563
Okay.

38:07.425 --> 38:10.953
If my mom ever asks, I got the test and I’m fine…

38:11.506 --> 38:13.661
and the same goes for Haley, alright?

38:15.633 --> 38:16.918
If that’s what you want.

38:18.290 --> 38:19.356
Thanks.

38:26.293 --> 38:27.143
Holiday,

38:29.227 --> 38:30.307
Holiday,

38:32.212 --> 38:33.973
It’s the best day,

38:35.331 --> 38:37.306
It’s an ice-cream day,

38:38.402 --> 38:40.149
I am only happy,

38:41.223 --> 38:42.322
When I have,

38:43.926 --> 38:46.594
Holiday, holiday, holiday...

38:54.906 --> 38:58.509
Saturday, nine thirty-two p.m.

38:58.607 --> 39:01.146
Hey, TRIC, we need to talk.

39:01.954 --> 39:03.598
End of messages.

39:10.203 --> 39:14.017
Where do you go when you’re lonely,

39:15.241 --> 39:19.716
Where do you go when you’re blue,

39:23.505 --> 39:24.559
My husband!

39:24.718 --> 39:26.710
Hey. What was that?

39:27.036 --> 39:29.593
Oh, just a works in progress. I don’t want you to hear it yet.

39:30.104 --> 39:30.826
Okay.

39:31.163 --> 39:32.741
Well? Did you have fun with Lucas?

39:33.607 --> 39:35.727
- Yeah! Yeah, we had a great time.
- Good.

39:35.788 --> 39:39.545
- How bout you?
- Hmmm, good. Really good.

39:49.262 --> 39:51.132
Mom!? I’m home!

40:00.851 --> 40:03.404
Roe. Yes professor?

40:09.758 --> 40:11.357
Hey, how was the slumber party?

40:12.549 --> 40:16.084
As a matter of fact, it was great. Not thank to you.

40:16.738 --> 40:17.547
What?!

40:18.452 --> 40:20.583
You caused a lot of problems Felix.

40:21.439 --> 40:22.615
Ah, they’ll get over it.

40:23.605 --> 40:26.522
You know, Felix, you do this everywhere we go.

40:26.829 --> 40:29.829
And girls fall for it because they think that you’re cute…

40:29.933 --> 40:34.807
or funny or that they’ll actually… get something out of it… other than a bad reputation.

40:36.997 --> 40:38.483
I like these people.

40:39.215 --> 40:40.449
I like Brooke.

40:41.069 --> 40:43.781
And I really don’t like you for not caring about her.

40:45.291 --> 40:46.864
I do care about her.

40:53.105 --> 40:55.260
I really… like her, Anna.

40:57.954 --> 40:59.029
For real, okay?

41:02.997 --> 41:04.696
But it’s against the rules.

41:06.106 --> 41:07.503
I don’t know what to do.

41:48.122 --> 41:49.748
I got the test results back.

41:53.856 --> 41:54.853
I’m fine.

42:02.497 --> 42:03.855
One in two right?
