WEBVTT

00:01.316 --> 00:05.252
- Tell Sir Algernon to hire someone else.
- Sir Algernon is the dog.

00:05.277 --> 00:06.420
The what?

00:07.889 --> 00:10.084
Have you off-loaded my dog yet?

00:10.158 --> 00:12.092
Sir Algernon Farnsworth.

00:12.160 --> 00:15.789
You're gonna go in and get my dog.
Real simple, real fast.

00:15.864 --> 00:19.231
- Hey, you.!
- Stop those men!

00:19.300 --> 00:21.268
Stop those men.!

00:21.336 --> 00:25.238
If that dog is worth something,
it has to be intrinsic to the dog itself.

00:25.306 --> 00:27.399
Maybe he has
some kind of peculiar talent.

00:27.475 --> 00:32.344
You couldn't pull a simple ABC job
like snatching a pooch.

00:32.414 --> 00:34.905
We use finesse,
not brute force.

00:34.983 --> 00:38.043
We don't need an old mustache
telling us how to do our jobs.

00:38.119 --> 00:40.644
That stinkin' dog.

00:40.722 --> 00:43.213
- Magnum!
- Come on.! Hurry up, will ya?

00:43.291 --> 00:45.054
I can't believe this!

00:48.830 --> 00:51.526
Now this old mustache,
as you put it,

00:51.599 --> 00:53.328
is gonna show you
how it's done.

00:55.603 --> 00:58.333
We got the gas tank.!
Come on.!

00:58.406 --> 00:59.930
Come on.! Let's go.!

02:28.031 --> 02:32.400
All holiday cruise passengers
bound for Tahiti,

02:32.469 --> 02:37.099
our Pacific Princess luxury liner
will open for boarding at Pier 11
in five minutes.

02:37.174 --> 02:41.167
- All right. Pull her right over here.
- No, no, no. We can't park here.

02:41.244 --> 02:43.735
This is fine. It's fine.

02:43.814 --> 02:46.282
This is a yellow zone.

02:46.349 --> 02:48.579
A yellow zone?

02:48.652 --> 02:52.110
We're here to pull a snatch,
and you're worried
about yellow zones?

02:52.189 --> 02:55.124
It won't do us any good
to draw attention by parking illegally.

02:55.192 --> 02:58.923
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we should have come out
on a bus like some tourists...

02:58.995 --> 03:01.054
with the flowered shirts.

03:01.131 --> 03:04.532
- Will you get going?
- All right, all right.

03:12.142 --> 03:14.133
Come on, Mitch.

03:20.083 --> 03:22.415
Hey, uh, you're gonna
have to move this vehicle.

03:22.486 --> 03:24.920
It's all right.
I'm here to pick someone up.

03:24.988 --> 03:27.650
Look, this is a yellow zone.
You gotta move out.

03:27.724 --> 03:31.660
Officer, I'm here to pick up
Mama DiGiorgio.

03:31.728 --> 03:34.128
My nephew,
he went to find her.

03:34.197 --> 03:36.893
She-- She has a little trouble
getting around on the crutches.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.800
Sorry. We all got our problems,
but you're gonna have to move this car.

03:39.870 --> 03:43.431
Hey, a nephew like mine
you've never seen.

03:43.507 --> 03:47.944
He always promised us--
""Aunt Gina, Uncle Vic--''

03:48.011 --> 03:50.673
That's me. Uncle Vic.

03:50.747 --> 03:55.150
""Someday I'm gonna
put you on a boat
and send you to Hawaii.''

03:55.218 --> 03:57.413
I'm sorry, sir,
but, uh, either you move this car,

03:57.487 --> 03:59.512
or I'm gonna have to call
the tow truck.

03:59.589 --> 04:02.615
Hey, that's some boy,
my nephew.

04:02.692 --> 04:06.025
Well, of course, uh,

04:06.096 --> 04:08.257
if she's on crutches.

04:12.936 --> 04:16.928
Captain Nakua, report to
the Pier 9 loading gate.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.998
Okay, guys. Here he is.

04:23.013 --> 04:25.413
That's Sir Algernon Farnsworth?

04:31.221 --> 04:33.155
We should have started earlier.

04:33.223 --> 04:36.283
Or I should have canceled
the afternoon meeting.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.953
The board meeting should be over
by 5:00, Mrs. Marston.

04:39.029 --> 04:42.123
You'll be able to see Sir Algernon
immediately afterward.

04:43.133 --> 04:47.035
I barely have time to say hello to him,
let alone make him feel welcome.

04:49.439 --> 04:51.373
Thank you.
Okay. Thanks, guys.

04:56.213 --> 04:58.579
Oh. Excuse me.

04:58.648 --> 05:01.310
Excuse me.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.375
I'm Mrs. Marston.

05:03.453 --> 05:06.820
Have you off-loaded my dog yet?
Sir Algernon Farnsworth.

05:06.890 --> 05:10.485
Yeah, the animal control people
just took him to the shelter.

05:10.560 --> 05:14.587
What in the world
are you talking about?

05:14.664 --> 05:19.226
I would never allow my Algie
to stay at a dog pound.

05:19.302 --> 05:22.635
He's staying at the Kaleawana Kennel
during quarantine.

05:22.706 --> 05:25.436
They just took him a minute ago.
Hey, there they are.

05:25.508 --> 05:28.238
- Hey, you.!
- Algie.!

05:28.311 --> 05:31.371
Stop those men!
Stop those men!

05:34.951 --> 05:37.579
- Come on! Let's get out of here!
- Algie!

05:39.723 --> 05:43.022
Oh, my baby.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.118
Algie. Aw.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.867
Where is he?
We had a little trouble.

05:52.936 --> 05:56.838
Feds or local?
Uh, neither.
That lady, Mrs. Marston.

05:56.906 --> 06:00.342
You mean you--
you come back without the dog
because of some old broad?

06:00.410 --> 06:02.935
She was running across the dock
screaming bloody murder.

06:03.013 --> 06:06.278
You're lucky she didn't have
the rest of the girls
from the mah-jongg club.

06:06.349 --> 06:08.283
Maybe you wouldn't have
gotten out alive.

06:08.351 --> 06:10.945
Don't worry.
We'll get the dog.

06:11.021 --> 06:14.252
I'm not worried.
You guys are gonna have to
answer to Dominic...

06:14.324 --> 06:16.588
if you lose that dog.

06:17.727 --> 06:21.390
Higgins, what's so important
about a dog?

06:21.464 --> 06:23.398
Magnum, we are
talking about the pet...

06:23.466 --> 06:26.560
of a very important
and highly regarded member
of the King Kamehameha Club.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.570
We're talking about a dog.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.936
No offense, guys.

06:31.007 --> 06:34.499
Tell Sir Algernon to hire someone else.

06:34.577 --> 06:37.740
Sir Algernon is the dog.
Mrs. Marston is your client.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.111
My what?

06:39.182 --> 06:41.514
I guaranteed your services.

06:41.584 --> 06:44.280
Higgins, don't you think
you should have checked with me first?

06:45.922 --> 06:48.390
Magnum,

06:48.458 --> 06:52.121
I would consider it a personal favor
if you would take on this matter.

06:52.195 --> 06:54.356
Oh.

06:54.431 --> 06:56.922
Why didn't you tell me that
in the first place?

06:58.001 --> 07:00.026
Tennis courts.

07:01.171 --> 07:04.538
Impossible.
Mr. Connors and Mr. Borg
are Robin's guests this weekend.

07:04.607 --> 07:07.132
- They'll be using the courts.
- Good.

07:07.210 --> 07:11.374
Then Jimmy can help me with my backhand
and Bjorn can help me with my serve.

07:11.448 --> 07:14.212
Magnum, I can't.

07:14.284 --> 07:16.309
Then neither can I.

07:22.392 --> 07:26.419
I am so glad that you have
agreed to protect Algie.

07:26.496 --> 07:30.364
Algie? I thought his name
was Sir Algernon Farnsworth.

07:30.433 --> 07:34.369
He prefers Algie.
He's very down-to-earth.

07:36.973 --> 07:38.702
I can see that.

07:38.775 --> 07:40.504
Quite a dog.

07:40.577 --> 07:43.307
One of a kind.

07:43.380 --> 07:46.838
Obviously. Um, sugar?

07:46.916 --> 07:49.407
- Please.
- Mrs. Marston,

07:49.486 --> 07:51.511
would you pay a ransom for Algie?

07:51.588 --> 07:55.080
Of course.
Money's no object
when it comes to Algie.

07:55.158 --> 07:59.561
Well, I think you were
the intended victim
of a couple of professional dognappers.

07:59.629 --> 08:02.826
See, they hang out at the docks,
see a likely candidate and kidnap it.

08:02.899 --> 08:05.561
You probably won't see or hear
from those two yo-yos again.

08:05.635 --> 08:07.762
Then hiring Magnum
would be a waste of your money.

08:07.837 --> 08:12.934
Of course, you do have to keep Algie
as well protected as possible
during the four-month quarantine.

08:13.009 --> 08:15.876
You said he was staying
at the Kaleawana Kennels?

08:16.880 --> 08:20.043
Oh. I think their security's top-notch.

08:20.116 --> 08:22.380
Well, I'd like to be
absolutely certain.

08:22.452 --> 08:25.717
Well, I could run a security check.

08:25.789 --> 08:29.384
On a kennel?
Why not? Nothing is too good
for Sir Algernon.

08:30.527 --> 08:32.791
I'll phone the kennel
and tell them you're coming.

08:32.861 --> 08:36.298
No, no. Don't do that.
They'd only upgrade their security
for my inspection.

08:36.366 --> 08:40.131
No, if someone was going to
try and kidnap your dog,
they would probably break in at night.

08:40.203 --> 08:43.832
That's when I'll make my inspection.
There's nothing you can do
till tonight?

08:43.907 --> 08:48.901
Not really.
Besides, I have a previous conference
with a couple of pros.

08:51.047 --> 08:53.038
Right, Higgins?

08:59.489 --> 09:03.118
Hey, blondie, throw that thing
to me, will you, babes?

09:03.193 --> 09:05.388
Come on.

09:07.230 --> 09:10.757
Hey. Hey, Steve.

09:10.834 --> 09:13.667
Tell the truth.
You like girls?

09:13.736 --> 09:16.864
Of course I like girls.
Well, why don't you
come over and look?

09:16.940 --> 09:20.774
Because I've got reports
to fill out.
Reports?

09:20.844 --> 09:23.506
What is the family coming to?

09:23.580 --> 09:27.346
Your father and I,
may his soul rest in peace,

09:27.417 --> 09:29.351
we never made no reports.

09:29.419 --> 09:32.855
Mr. DiGiorgio, if you'd done
a little paperwork,
we wouldn't be here now.

09:32.922 --> 09:35.049
I-- I-- I don't believe you.

09:35.124 --> 09:39.993
You couldn't pull a simple ABC job
like snatching a pooch.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.959
You know, once, your father and I,

09:44.033 --> 09:45.967
you know what we had to do?

09:46.035 --> 09:49.801
j. Edgar Hoover had this stoolie
with 20 agents surrounding him.

09:49.873 --> 09:51.807
You know what we did?

09:51.875 --> 09:54.173
We grabbed an armored truck
with a turret gun.

09:54.244 --> 09:56.371
A turret gun.!

09:56.446 --> 09:58.880
And we blew our way in!

09:58.948 --> 10:00.882
Things aren't done like that anymore.

10:00.950 --> 10:03.646
We use finesse,
not brute force.

10:03.720 --> 10:07.178
Finesse? What do you think
you are, Steve?

10:07.257 --> 10:10.055
You think you're still captain
of that Harvard chess team?

10:10.126 --> 10:13.027
- Yale.
- Yale, Harvard.

10:13.096 --> 10:15.121
Mr. DiGiorgio, with all due respect,

10:15.198 --> 10:19.134
we don't need an old mustache
telling us how to do our jobs.

10:19.202 --> 10:23.332
Maybe not, baby.
But you need somebody
to tell you somethin'.

10:23.406 --> 10:25.931
Steve, I got everything.

10:26.009 --> 10:30.446
All right. Real good.
Mr. DiGiorgio, we get your dog tonight.

10:30.513 --> 10:33.607
You're gonna dress up
like two Good Humor men...

10:33.683 --> 10:37.983
and go in there
and bribe the night watchman
with a Popsicle?

10:39.322 --> 10:41.313
Something like that.

10:43.593 --> 10:46.528
The Department of Health?
Uh, yes, that's right.

10:46.596 --> 10:48.894
Uh, I'm sorry about
the strange hour. Thank you.

10:48.965 --> 10:51.559
But the outbreak
was only recently discovered...

10:51.634 --> 10:53.966
when two gerbils
escaped from a cargo hold...

10:54.037 --> 10:57.029
and attacked the crew
while they were tying up to a dock.
What?

10:57.106 --> 10:59.506
It's just a little joke.

10:59.576 --> 11:02.044
But, uh, actually,
I have to check all animals...

11:02.111 --> 11:04.443
that have entered quarantine
in the last 2 4 hours.

11:04.514 --> 11:07.711
You see, two dogs from Hong Kong
have contracted a rare...

11:07.784 --> 11:10.344
and highly contagious disease.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.355
And it usually affects cattle,
and since these are sheepdogs,

11:13.423 --> 11:17.018
I think you can see
how dangerous this could be.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.220
If it ain't one thing,
it's another.

11:19.295 --> 11:22.526
First, the State, uh,

11:22.599 --> 11:26.057
Quarantine Board
pulling a surprise check
and now you.

11:27.136 --> 11:31.596
The State Quarantine Board?
Got here just before you did.

11:31.674 --> 11:33.869
Thirty years on the job.

11:33.943 --> 11:37.140
I never had
this kind of activity on my shift.

11:37.213 --> 11:40.307
- A-Are they still in there?
- Yeah.

11:41.384 --> 11:45.081
Matter of fact, uh,
you may have to wait
until they've finished up.

11:47.590 --> 11:50.559
Come on. Get him out.
He's just a dog.
I'm tryin'! I'm tryin'!

11:50.627 --> 11:53.391
Hi, guys.

11:53.463 --> 11:55.397
Oh, uh, we're
the State Quarantine Board.

11:55.465 --> 11:58.025
This dog happens to be infected
with a type of, uh, flea...

11:58.101 --> 11:59.693
that carries bubonic plague.

11:59.769 --> 12:02.329
We're gonna have
to isolate him.
With a syringe?

12:02.405 --> 12:04.373
Call the police.

12:07.176 --> 12:08.973
Hold it!

12:31.258 --> 12:33.226
Nothing.

12:33.251 --> 12:34.809
Absolutely nothing.

12:34.886 --> 12:37.081
Wait a minute.
What's that?

12:37.155 --> 12:39.146
His lunch.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.425
There's nothing surgically
implanted under the skin,

12:45.497 --> 12:48.193
nothing in his teeth,
nothing in the collar.

12:48.266 --> 12:50.734
If that dog is worth something,

12:50.802 --> 12:53.236
it has to be intrinsic
to the dog itself.

12:54.506 --> 12:57.532
Well, maybe he has
some kind of peculiar talent.

12:57.609 --> 12:59.372
Such as what?
Lifting his leg?

12:59.444 --> 13:02.072
Police do train dogs
to sniff out explosives or drugs.

13:02.147 --> 13:05.048
Those are highly trained,
extremely intelligent breeds--

13:05.117 --> 13:07.483
dogs such as Apollo and Zeus,
not mongrels.

13:07.552 --> 13:11.044
Well, I will have you know
that that mongrel
stuck with me last night,

13:11.123 --> 13:13.182
which is more than those two
would ever do.

13:14.459 --> 13:16.427
I rest my case.

13:19.798 --> 13:22.733
- Identify yourself.
- Do what?

13:22.801 --> 13:24.325
T.C., shag it.

13:24.402 --> 13:28.099
Shag it?
Yeah. Security password.

13:28.173 --> 13:31.665
Magnum, you’re committing a breach
of security. You can't do this.

13:31.743 --> 13:36.271
I don't know what you're up to,
Magnum, but whatever it is,
it's not going to work. Not this time.

13:36.348 --> 13:38.475
Wanna bet?
Yes. Whatever it is you want.

13:38.550 --> 13:41.644
The car for a month,
the tennis courts for a year,
the wine cellar.

13:41.720 --> 13:45.918
Whatever it is,
it's still not going to work.

13:45.991 --> 13:50.360
There are times when one human being
really shouldn't take advantage of another,

13:50.428 --> 13:52.396
but this wasn't one of them.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.465
Look, why can't we build it here?

14:00.539 --> 14:05.340
The area's obviously being used
by people coming from the main house
down to the tennis courts.

14:05.410 --> 14:08.072
The dog can't make contact
with more than two or three people.

14:08.146 --> 14:10.876
Well, that's gonna be impossible.
People roam around here...

14:10.949 --> 14:13.042
like it was
the Honolulu International--

14:13.118 --> 14:15.382
I didn't make up the rules.

14:17.689 --> 14:20.317
All right, men.
Put it wherever she wants it.

14:23.361 --> 14:25.852
Stop. Whatever you're doing,
stop it.

14:25.931 --> 14:28.525
Hi, Higgins.
Don't "Hi, Higgins" me.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.068
just get you and your juvenile
delinquents out of here.

14:31.136 --> 14:34.299
juvenile delinquents?
Man, those are some of
the best athletes on my team.

14:34.372 --> 14:36.567
And now I'm teaching them
how to work for a living.

14:36.641 --> 14:40.270
Now, those skilled laborers
are gonna earn $200 building the run.

14:40.345 --> 14:43.576
Run?
You must be Higgins.
I'm Sharon Carnes,

14:43.648 --> 14:46.845
State Board of Agriculture
and Animal Regulations.
How do you do? What run?

14:46.918 --> 14:49.512
- Dog run.
- ""Dog run''?

14:49.588 --> 14:51.988
- Yeah.
- Hi, Sharon. How you doing?

14:52.057 --> 14:53.991
Hi, Thomas.
Hi, guys.

14:54.059 --> 14:56.425
Magnum, you didn't mention
a tidal pool.

14:56.494 --> 15:00.555
Naturally, you'll have to make sure
Sir Algernon Farnsworth
does not enter the ocean.

15:00.632 --> 15:03.965
Naturally.
No. Oh, no.

15:04.035 --> 15:06.595
Excuse me.
I told you not to bet.

15:06.671 --> 15:10.437
Sure.
It doesn't matter.
That animal cannot stay here.

15:11.443 --> 15:14.378
T.C., build it wherever
she wants.

15:14.446 --> 15:16.380
Right on.

15:20.318 --> 15:22.752
Higgins.
No.

15:22.821 --> 15:24.755
No, no, no!

15:24.823 --> 15:27.883
Look, I cannot protect a dog
that is 20 miles away...

15:27.959 --> 15:30.951
in a kennel with poor security.

15:31.029 --> 15:34.487
How did you manage
to arrange this, Magnum?
Hawaii has very strict quarantine laws.

15:34.566 --> 15:37.091
It wasn't easy.
Mrs. Marston had to
pull a lot of strings.

15:37.168 --> 15:41.264
Now, all we have to do
is make a few concessions
and abide by the rules.

15:41.339 --> 15:44.536
No, we don't, since that dog
is not going to stay here.

15:44.609 --> 15:48.067
Okay. Mrs. Marston
went through a lot of trouble
to arrange this,

15:48.146 --> 15:50.512
but I guess she'll understand...

15:50.582 --> 15:53.142
when you explain it to her.

15:58.423 --> 16:00.414
- How long?
- A year.

16:00.492 --> 16:04.929
A year? The quarantine period
is only four months.

16:04.996 --> 16:07.157
Oh, Algie'll only be here
a week or so...

16:07.232 --> 16:09.700
till I track down whoever's after him.

16:09.768 --> 16:13.169
But I want the tennis courts
for a year.

16:14.439 --> 16:17.636
That was one of the bets
you offered, wasn't it?

16:19.644 --> 16:22.943
Don't feel sorry for Higgins.
He never totally loses.

16:23.014 --> 16:26.142
When Sharon and I left
to get Sir Farnsworth at the kennel,

16:26.217 --> 16:28.811
the Ferrari had mysteriously disappeared.

16:28.887 --> 16:32.448
So I took the Jimmy
and wondered what could go wrong next.

16:32.524 --> 16:35.459
I really think this is the wrong way
to go about this.

16:35.527 --> 16:37.222
Look, we're not taking a vote.

16:37.295 --> 16:40.731
Now, you guys,
you're gonna go in and get my dog.

16:40.799 --> 16:43.666
Real simple, real fast.
In and out.

16:43.735 --> 16:46.067
Anybody gets in your way--
bing, bang, boom.

16:46.137 --> 16:48.162
It's broad daylight.

16:48.239 --> 16:51.606
The middle of the night
didn't exactly work like a charm.

16:51.676 --> 16:55.203
Now, believe me,
no one will be ready for you guys...

16:55.280 --> 16:58.613
walking through that front door
at noon.

16:58.683 --> 17:02.449
That's how your old man and I
hit the City National.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.954
What do you think
put you through Harvard?
Yale.

17:05.022 --> 17:06.957
Yale.

17:07.025 --> 17:09.016
Hey, that's your dog.

17:09.094 --> 17:11.186
Please keep him
on a shorter leash.

17:11.262 --> 17:13.821
Sharon, are you afraid
of this dog?
I'm not ""cynophobic.""

17:13.897 --> 17:16.263
I just don't like animals
sniffing at me.

17:16.334 --> 17:18.233
Cynophobic?

17:18.303 --> 17:21.897
Who's the guy and the dame?
That's the-- the guy
from last night.

17:21.973 --> 17:26.467
Sharon, if you're
afraid of the dog, just say so.
I'm not afraid of the dog.

17:28.346 --> 17:32.908
That would be silly, wouldn't it?
I mean, to put a dog in custody
of someone afraid of it.

17:32.984 --> 17:36.442
No. If you're afraid, you're afraid.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

17:36.521 --> 17:39.217
But I'm not afraid.
Okay.

17:39.290 --> 17:41.383
You're not afraid.

17:43.895 --> 17:45.886
Up. Up.

17:45.964 --> 17:49.764
Hey, they're making it easy for us.

17:49.834 --> 17:52.064
We'll take the dog on the road.

17:52.137 --> 17:54.867
On the road?
We don't even have a plan.

17:54.939 --> 17:58.033
We don't need a plan.
We got this.

18:01.212 --> 18:03.305
Come on, Algie.

18:17.295 --> 18:20.059
Move it!

18:25.070 --> 18:27.402
Sir Farnsworth, come here.

18:27.472 --> 18:30.703
Sir Farnsworth.
Come here.

18:30.775 --> 18:32.970
Come here. Stay.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.813
- Damn.
- What?

18:47.092 --> 18:49.151
Oh, nothing.

18:49.227 --> 18:51.195
How you doing, Sir Farnsworth?

18:59.304 --> 19:01.499
Why are we stopping?
We need gas.

19:02.574 --> 19:05.907
- The tank's full.
- Uh, the gauge sticks.

19:14.385 --> 19:18.048
I'll be right back.
You just tell the attendant
to fill it up.

19:18.123 --> 19:21.058
And don't leave Algie.

19:42.747 --> 19:45.045
Hello. Island Hoppers.
T.C., it's Magnum.

19:45.116 --> 19:47.744
Aha! Hey, Thomas.
My kids got their $200,

19:47.819 --> 19:51.118
but I'm still short $1 63.59.

19:51.189 --> 19:54.454
Yeah, look, when I get paid
by Mrs. Marston, you'll get paid.

19:54.526 --> 19:58.223
I'm at a gas station
about five miles north
of Chinaman's Hat on my way to Robin's.

19:58.296 --> 20:02.494
- How long would it take you to get here?
Twenty minutes if I wanted to, which I don't.

20:02.567 --> 20:05.468
That is unless you got my $1 63.59.

20:05.537 --> 20:09.906
Look, T.C., I think I'm being followed
by a black sedan with rental plates.

20:09.974 --> 20:12.534
Then why don't you hire
a real private investigator?

20:12.610 --> 20:14.771
Or better yet,
why don't you call the cops?

20:14.846 --> 20:18.509
And tell them what?
I'm being followed by three guys
who are after a dog?

20:18.583 --> 20:22.212
I gotta let them make a move first.
I'd just like to know
I had a little high cover.

20:22.287 --> 20:24.915
Oh, yeah? And who's gonna pay
for this high cover?

20:26.424 --> 20:29.188
Excuse me, miss.
My name's Reardan. I'm with 5-0.

20:29.260 --> 20:32.559
If you could step right over
to our surveillance unit
and bring the dog along.

20:32.630 --> 20:34.689
5-0?

20:34.766 --> 20:37.599
We were informed
that someone's been trying to kidnap
Sir Farnsworth--

20:37.669 --> 20:41.400
Well, we've been assigned
as an undercover escort.

20:41.472 --> 20:45.408
Oh. Uh, would you mind
bringing the dog along, please?

20:45.476 --> 20:47.000
Me?

20:47.078 --> 20:49.546
Uh, Magnum will be back
in a minute. He'll do it.

20:49.614 --> 20:52.174
What the hell's going on here?
Let's go.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.684
Well, you get the dog.
I'll get that stinkin' dog.

20:54.752 --> 20:56.720
Magnum!
Come on, you lousy--

20:56.788 --> 20:58.847
Magnum.!
just put it on my bill, okay?

20:58.923 --> 21:01.915
No, I can't.
'Cause I ain't comin'.
Magnum, help.!

21:01.993 --> 21:03.893
Thomas?

21:03.962 --> 21:06.658
- Come on.! Hurry up, will ya?
- Excuse me.

21:06.731 --> 21:08.756
Come here, you lousy mutt.

21:08.833 --> 21:10.767
Hey. Hey. What the hell?

21:10.835 --> 21:13.497
- What are you doing?
- Hey, who--

21:15.373 --> 21:17.773
I can't believe this!

21:31.222 --> 21:35.124
Come on! Come on, you lollipops!

21:46.204 --> 21:49.105
What's going on?
They're the ones after Algie.

21:49.173 --> 21:51.664
They said they were from 5-0.

21:51.743 --> 21:54.143
And you believed 'em?
Why not?

21:54.212 --> 21:57.841
You didn't give them
a chance to say anything.
Right.

21:57.915 --> 21:59.780
College boys!

21:59.851 --> 22:02.046
Now this old mustache,
as you put it,

22:02.120 --> 22:04.088
is gonna show you how it's done.

22:11.095 --> 22:14.997
If you guys had used
that piece back there,

22:15.066 --> 22:17.261
we'd be making tracks
with that dog right now.

22:17.335 --> 22:20.202
And we'd have a dozen witnesses
to I.D. us afterwards.

22:22.473 --> 22:25.340
Well, there ain't gonna be
no witnesses now.

22:25.410 --> 22:27.344
So be a good boy...

22:27.412 --> 22:31.007
and pull that piece
and get ready to use it.

22:50.818 --> 22:53.685
Whoever he is,
he's one hell of a driver.

22:53.754 --> 22:55.688
Why doesn't that
make me feel better?

22:55.756 --> 22:57.815
Oh, don't worry.
He can't keep it up.

23:04.231 --> 23:06.529
Now where's he going?

23:06.600 --> 23:08.625
Hang on. I'm gonna lose him.

23:36.964 --> 23:40.092
You can't go in there.
Yeah? Well, who's gonna stop me?

23:44.705 --> 23:47.674
Look out.

23:48.843 --> 23:51.869
- That guy's crazy.
- He's crazy?

23:59.687 --> 24:02.178
Well, he'll never follow us in here.

24:03.724 --> 24:06.352
Yeah. We'll be okay now.

24:07.728 --> 24:10.561
If we ever find our way out of here.

24:10.631 --> 24:14.158
I'm gonna get that mutt
if it's the last thing I do.

24:29.183 --> 24:31.174
You're not stopping?

24:31.252 --> 24:33.015
I-I've got to. We're out of gas.

24:33.087 --> 24:36.454
And I thought you were lying
about the needle being stuck
and needing gas.

24:36.524 --> 24:40.756
I was lying about the needle
being stuck and needing gas,
but they must have shot holes in the tank.

24:48.569 --> 24:50.594
Magnum, be--
Shh.

24:53.407 --> 24:55.375
They're stuck.

25:00.781 --> 25:02.715
Damn it.

25:06.854 --> 25:09.516
I can't even get out.
Turn the motor off.

25:11.258 --> 25:13.818
Dummy!

25:21.068 --> 25:23.969
I'm sorry. Really.
That's okay, Sharon.

25:24.038 --> 25:26.905
You've just gotta learn
to trust people. That's all.
Right, Algie?

25:36.016 --> 25:39.042
Hey. Shh.

25:39.119 --> 25:43.249
They're stuck too.
Come on!

25:43.324 --> 25:45.690
My luck is still with me.

26:23.964 --> 26:26.592
You son of a gun!

26:26.667 --> 26:29.898
On the bull's-eye!
We got the gas tank!

26:29.970 --> 26:32.268
Come on. Come on.
Let's go.

26:32.339 --> 26:35.399
There's not much more road.
Who cares about the road?

26:35.476 --> 26:38.604
What are we gonna do here?
Set up a picnic basket?

26:38.679 --> 26:41.204
Come on! Move it, will ya?
Move it!

26:41.282 --> 26:43.273
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

26:50.591 --> 26:52.786
You all right?

26:52.860 --> 26:54.794
Here.
Yes.

26:54.862 --> 26:57.353
Well, let's see.
No, I-- I'm fine.

27:26.460 --> 27:28.985
Hi, guys.

27:29.063 --> 27:32.328
You're trespassing.
I've got the right to shoot trespassers.

27:32.399 --> 27:34.867
Isn't that right, Manu?
I just give it to you.

27:34.935 --> 27:37.460
We're not trespassing.
We're being chased.

27:37.538 --> 27:39.472
Chased?

27:39.540 --> 27:42.668
Yes. Uh, besides, uh,

27:42.743 --> 27:46.179
the banana plantations
reverted back to the government
when the leases ran out.

27:46.246 --> 27:50.546
So we can't be trespassing.
Uh, especially since I work for the people--
Me.

27:50.617 --> 27:53.711
Uh, she's working for me.
We got a couple guys from 5-0 on our tail.

27:53.787 --> 27:56.517
I thought you said they weren't from 5-0.
Well, not all of them.

27:56.590 --> 28:00.185
The Justice Department
always sends a couple of local cops
with one of their federal agents.

28:00.260 --> 28:01.522
You got the feds after you?

28:01.595 --> 28:04.496
- No.
- Yes. We came up here in a pickup truck
with a load of seedlings.

28:04.565 --> 28:08.057
We were looking for a place
to find our patch when they jumped us.
Seedlings?

28:08.135 --> 28:11.127
We didn't realize
that you guys were already up here.
I'm sorry.

28:11.205 --> 28:14.299
Oh, that's okay.
How far is the highway
from here, brah?

28:14.375 --> 28:16.309
Tom!
About a mile down.

28:16.377 --> 28:18.572
Oh, good. What?
This is cannabis. Grass!

28:18.645 --> 28:20.579
Yes. Yes, I know it is.

28:20.647 --> 28:23.411
Uh, your stuff looks
much healthier than ours anyway.

28:23.484 --> 28:26.078
Oh, you should try
Hapuna buzz, brah.
Hey, right.

28:26.153 --> 28:29.520
That's good stuff.
Let's go. Let's go.

28:32.393 --> 28:34.361
Come on, college boys.

28:34.428 --> 28:37.158
You're moving
like you're older than I am,
for crying out loud.

28:37.231 --> 28:39.222
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:44.705 --> 28:47.037
Lost, man?

28:49.109 --> 28:51.043
Oh, come on.

28:51.111 --> 28:54.239
just a minute.
I want to try and get a fix
on exactly where we are...

28:54.314 --> 28:57.647
so I can let 'em know
about their little patch.

28:57.718 --> 28:59.686
Let's go.

28:59.753 --> 29:01.448
All right.

29:03.824 --> 29:06.190
Who the hell are they?

29:06.260 --> 29:08.194
They gotta be moonshiners.

29:08.262 --> 29:10.730
There's gotta be
a still around here somewhere.

29:10.798 --> 29:13.961
They're growing grass.
We've stumbled into their patch.

29:14.034 --> 29:19.062
Grass? Why would anybody
be growing grass in a banana patch?

29:19.139 --> 29:21.232
I got it in the leg.

29:24.178 --> 29:26.146
Come on, come on!
We can't stay here.

29:26.213 --> 29:28.147
For once, you're right.

29:28.215 --> 29:33.585
Listen, give me his piece,
get your fraternity brother out of here,
and I'll cover.

29:49.470 --> 29:51.836
Come on.

30:09.490 --> 30:11.481
Come on, Algie.

30:37.651 --> 30:40.984
just rest a minute to catch my breath.
Okay.

30:41.054 --> 30:44.751
Oh, man. I've never seen anything
like this guy. He's nuts.

30:44.825 --> 30:47.293
The guy's crazy.
He thinks he's Al Capone.

31:09.416 --> 31:12.613
It's okay, fella.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

31:12.686 --> 31:15.177
You really think
he understands you
when you say that?

31:15.255 --> 31:19.316
Well, sure.
Maybe not every word,
but he senses my meaning.

31:19.393 --> 31:22.988
That's nonsense.
Dogs are strictly stimuli-motivated.

31:23.063 --> 31:25.896
You slap him, he's punished.

31:25.966 --> 31:30.369
You pet him, he's rewarded.
He-- He can't understand words like
""No one's gonna hurt you, boy.''

31:30.437 --> 31:34.373
Oh, look, just 'cause
you're afraid of dogs--
I'm not afraid of dogs.

31:41.014 --> 31:43.608
I'm sorry.
No, it's all right.

31:45.519 --> 31:49.615
It's just that I'm confused,
tired, scared, and I--

31:49.690 --> 31:51.681
And?

31:53.961 --> 31:55.952
And afraid of dogs.

31:58.098 --> 32:00.623
Algie and I kind of
had that figured out.

32:02.302 --> 32:04.668
It's nothin' to be ashamed of.

32:14.615 --> 32:16.549
How you doin'?
All right. I'm all right.

32:16.617 --> 32:19.450
What do you think?
They gotta be there.

32:26.126 --> 32:28.993
After I got my master's
in marine biology,

32:29.062 --> 32:32.088
I came to Hawaii looking for a job
working with marine mammals.

32:32.165 --> 32:34.827
Whales, dolphins, seals.

32:36.003 --> 32:37.937
But they don't start you out there.

32:38.005 --> 32:41.406
You have to put in a year or so
working with... dogs,

32:41.475 --> 32:43.500
cats, birds,

32:43.577 --> 32:47.035
until there's an opening
in the marine maintenance section.

32:47.114 --> 32:50.413
If they knew that I was afraid of dogs,
they'd let me go.

32:50.484 --> 32:54.181
And you wouldn't have a chance
to save the whales.

32:54.254 --> 32:57.917
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, don't worry.

32:57.991 --> 32:59.982
Your secret's safe with us.
Right, Algie?

33:01.361 --> 33:03.226
Thanks, Algie.

33:08.935 --> 33:11.199
Come on, Algie.
We've got company.

33:11.271 --> 33:13.535
Come on, Algie.
Come on.!

33:28.288 --> 33:30.381
Get Algie, will ya?
And stay there.

33:47.574 --> 33:49.872
Come on.

33:49.943 --> 33:52.571
Hold it. Hold it.

33:52.646 --> 33:55.376
What? What now?

33:55.449 --> 33:57.679
I gotta reload.

33:57.751 --> 34:00.515
Here. Do I have to do everything?

34:00.587 --> 34:02.748
Will you earn your living?
Load 'em up!

34:02.823 --> 34:05.314
Listen to me.
Either we go in there
and get that dog,

34:05.392 --> 34:07.326
or we get the hell out of here.

34:07.394 --> 34:09.453
Relax, will ya?

34:09.529 --> 34:12.362
Look, we're--
we're in the middle of nowhere.

34:12.431 --> 34:14.366
They got nowhere to go...

34:14.434 --> 34:16.527
but the ocean and the sharks.

34:16.603 --> 34:19.163
Now we can make a plan.

34:19.239 --> 34:22.538
- Now you want to make a plan.
- And my leg's still bleeding.

34:22.609 --> 34:24.668
A little buckshot
never hurt anybody.

34:24.745 --> 34:28.272
Hey, you want to hear about blood?
1 934, your father and I--

34:28.348 --> 34:31.579
No more!
No more stories
about the old days, huh?

34:31.650 --> 34:35.178
All right! All right!
Give me my piece.

34:37.824 --> 34:41.225
Now we're gonna go down that pier
and get that rotten dog,

34:41.293 --> 34:45.754
even if we have to blast those two
out of that shack!

34:45.831 --> 34:47.766
You got it?
I got it.

34:47.833 --> 34:51.793
You gonna be able to make it?
Yeah. It's just a flesh wound. I'll be okay.

34:51.871 --> 34:53.840
Aha!

34:53.907 --> 34:57.434
You see?
Looks like the college kid grew up.

34:57.511 --> 34:59.502
Let's go.

35:52.966 --> 35:56.458
Shoot.

36:31.638 --> 36:34.129
Mitch, go around the back!

36:34.207 --> 36:36.300
Come on!

36:52.759 --> 36:54.693
Shh.

37:12.279 --> 37:14.270
Shh! Shh!

37:17.484 --> 37:22.046
Look, whoever you are,
all I want is my dog.!

37:22.122 --> 37:25.785
- Your dog?
- He was stolen from me,

37:25.859 --> 37:28.350
his rightful and legal owner.

37:28.428 --> 37:30.396
Now what do you say?

37:30.463 --> 37:33.398
Look, you got nowhere to go.
You're trapped.

37:33.466 --> 37:35.627
I'll make a deal.

37:36.803 --> 37:39.533
You two for my dog.

37:41.041 --> 37:42.975
I ain't got all day.

38:20.630 --> 38:23.428
Man, I don't believe it.

38:54.197 --> 38:56.188
Come on, Algie.
Come on.
Go on.

38:56.266 --> 38:58.257
Come on, Algie.
Algie.

39:01.104 --> 39:03.436
Go. Go.
Hey, Algie.

39:03.506 --> 39:05.599
Algie, I got ya.
Come on.

39:05.675 --> 39:07.700
That's it.
Good boy.

39:33.369 --> 39:35.394
Man, some things never change.

39:45.148 --> 39:48.208
- Who's gonna pay for that?
- Just put it on my bill.

39:52.455 --> 39:55.447
I don't believe it!

39:55.525 --> 39:59.962
See what I mean?
It's not that easy
to get that damn dog.

40:10.573 --> 40:13.508
Enough. Enough.
The entire episode is absurd.

40:13.576 --> 40:17.068
Yeah, you got that right.
But true, right, T.C.?

40:17.146 --> 40:20.513
Oh, yeah. Sure is.
And I got 450 bucks' worth
of bullet holes...

40:20.583 --> 40:22.551
in my bird to prove it.

40:22.618 --> 40:24.677
Well, I don't believe you--
either of you.

40:24.754 --> 40:29.191
And neither will Mr. Masters
when I tell him you lost
his favorite pickup truck in a banana field.

40:29.258 --> 40:31.192
No, no.
It ain't lost. I spotted it.

40:31.260 --> 40:34.525
See, that's how I found him.
You see, I was in my bird,
and then I was--

40:34.597 --> 40:39.330
Please, not again.
Higgins, we couldn't possibly
have even invented this story.

40:39.402 --> 40:42.997
And besides, it all started
with your friend Mrs. Marston,
remember?

40:48.511 --> 40:52.140
Assuming that you are telling the truth--
and it's a huge assumption--

40:52.215 --> 40:54.809
what could possibly make this dog
worth all that trouble?

40:54.884 --> 40:57.045
I don't know!

40:57.120 --> 41:00.886
But I think I have a way
of finding out.
T.C., I'm gonna call Rick.

41:00.957 --> 41:04.723
Mm-hmm.
As long as you don't call me.

41:09.699 --> 41:12.668
Rick wasn't overly enthusiastic
about my plan.

41:12.735 --> 41:16.728
He thought it had
some holes in it, and he was afraid
they would end up in him.

41:16.806 --> 41:18.933
I told him that was ridiculous.

41:46.836 --> 41:49.464
What's your problem?
What are you, coconuts, or what?

41:57.447 --> 41:59.438
Whoa. What is this?

41:59.515 --> 42:01.506
just follow that car.

42:05.888 --> 42:10.154
You know, uh, unless there's
a black market for chlorine and skimmers,
you're just wasting your time.

42:10.226 --> 42:12.854
What were you doing
on the estate?
I was reroofing the garage.

42:12.929 --> 42:15.420
What do you think I was doing?
I was cleaning the pool.

42:15.498 --> 42:17.898
You don't clean tidal pools,

42:17.967 --> 42:19.901
and that's all they've got.

42:19.969 --> 42:23.427
Oh, no kidding? I--
I thought there was something funny.

42:23.506 --> 42:25.770
You'd be surprised
what you find in people's filters.

42:25.842 --> 42:29.801
One time I found a Chicago Cubs glove,
and another time I found this--

42:29.879 --> 42:31.491
Yeah, right. I get your drift.

42:31.516 --> 42:33.507
just keep on driving.

42:46.062 --> 42:49.190
$ 1 63.59 for materials,

42:49.265 --> 42:52.257
$450 for bullet holes,

42:53.302 --> 42:55.930
$200 for the trip there,

42:56.005 --> 42:57.973
200 more dollars for this trip.

42:58.040 --> 43:02.773
Man, that comes
to a grand total of $1 ,01 3.59.

43:02.845 --> 43:04.836
And that ain't including tax.

43:06.582 --> 43:08.516
That's it. Take us down.

43:08.584 --> 43:11.348
But not close enough
for them to hear.
If I land out of hearing range,

43:11.420 --> 43:14.787
it'll take you 1 5 minutes to get there,
and Rick could be in trouble by then.

43:14.857 --> 43:17.018
Can you split the difference?
You got it, good buddy.

43:19.529 --> 43:21.963
Okay, Mr. Pool Man.

43:22.031 --> 43:24.022
just pull it right up there.

43:36.279 --> 43:38.440
Get out.

43:38.514 --> 43:40.505
Come on. Get out.

43:45.621 --> 43:47.612
Let's go.
Let's go. Move.

43:47.690 --> 43:49.681
Okay, okay. I'm going.

43:51.794 --> 43:53.728
Come on, come on.

43:53.796 --> 43:55.730
Steve, you get the dog?

43:55.798 --> 43:58.631
Victor DiGiorgio. I thought
you died in the pen years ago.

43:58.701 --> 44:00.635
Who's the mouth?
Orville.

44:00.703 --> 44:04.230
Orville?
Yeah, Orville from Flatbush. I used to
do some running for High Shoes Leibo.

44:04.307 --> 44:07.071
They called me Little ""O.''
You remember, Mr. D.

44:07.143 --> 44:09.976
No. Where's my dog?
He's in the back.

44:10.046 --> 44:12.947
- Well, did you get the number?
- Not yet.

44:13.015 --> 44:16.712
Well, what the hell
are you waiting for?
Bring him out and check the tattoo.

44:16.786 --> 44:19.254
You tattooed a dog?
I love it. That's great, Mr. D.

44:19.322 --> 44:21.620
Watch the hands!

44:21.691 --> 44:25.787
Bring him out.!
I'd really prefer it
if you did, Mr. DiGiorgio.

44:25.861 --> 44:29.092
Me? Are you crazy?

44:29.165 --> 44:32.362
That dog'll tear me apart.
But he's your dog.

44:32.435 --> 44:36.064
Look, you know that
and I know that,
but that dog don't know it.

44:36.138 --> 44:38.265
He never
forgive me for leaving him...

44:38.341 --> 44:40.309
when I got sent up.

44:40.376 --> 44:42.844
He holds a grudge
like nobody you ever met.

44:42.912 --> 44:46.746
We're talking about a dog here.
All right.! He's small, but he's mean.!

44:46.816 --> 44:49.808
And he's got a memory
like a bull elephant!

44:49.885 --> 44:52.217
You bring him out.!

44:52.288 --> 44:56.281
Hey, don't even look at me.
I've had it with that animal.

44:56.359 --> 44:58.953
You. Orville.

44:59.028 --> 45:01.553
Call him out.
Nice and easy.

45:02.832 --> 45:05.027
Tattooing a dog.
That's great, Mr. D.

45:05.101 --> 45:07.661
Come on, come on.
Come on, Orville.

45:07.737 --> 45:12.071
Victor DiGiorgio. Boy, I really
remember him from Flatbush. I really do.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

45:12.141 --> 45:14.075
You can come out now, Algie.
It's all right.

45:14.143 --> 45:16.077
Now, lads.!

45:19.315 --> 45:21.283
Keep 'em off!. Get 'em off!.

45:21.350 --> 45:23.580
Hold it!

45:23.653 --> 45:25.951
Hold it!

45:32.061 --> 45:34.859
You really gotta
get into condition, Orville.

45:39.535 --> 45:41.696
I'm too old for this.

45:47.410 --> 45:50.971
- It's just a bunch of numbers.
- Well, hardly just a bunch of numbers.

45:51.047 --> 45:53.914
That tattoo is the call number
to a coded Swiss bank account.

45:53.983 --> 45:56.679
According to the F.B.I.,
it contained four million dollars--

45:56.752 --> 45:59.186
mob money DiGiorgio was holding
when he was sent to prison.

45:59.255 --> 46:02.281
And anyone with that number
can just get into the account?

46:02.358 --> 46:04.656
Yep. No names, no signatures.

46:04.727 --> 46:06.718
It's a favorite of businessmen.
And the mob.

46:06.796 --> 46:08.889
But--

46:08.964 --> 46:12.866
But how did Mrs. Marston
end up with a dog
that belonged to a mobster?

46:12.935 --> 46:17.565
Well, see, after Vic was sentenced,
he left the dog in the care
of, uh, his girlfriend.

46:17.640 --> 46:20.837
She was a hairdresser.
Well, he didn't tell her about the tattoo,

46:20.910 --> 46:23.879
but he just said
don't let the dog out of her sight.

46:23.946 --> 46:29.475
Well, they had a little fight, see,
and to spite him,
she gave the dog away to a customer.

46:29.552 --> 46:32.316
Mrs. Marston.

46:32.388 --> 46:34.515
We're going to miss you
around here, Sir Algernon.

46:34.590 --> 46:36.558
Algie's not leaving.

46:36.625 --> 46:40.026
He's not?
I mean, uh, he's not?

46:40.096 --> 46:42.690
Getting space in the Kaleawana Kennel
is very difficult.

46:42.765 --> 46:44.699
It sometimes takes months.

46:44.767 --> 46:47.531
By then, Algie's
quarantine period will be over.

46:48.904 --> 46:53.136
Mrs. Marston thought,
as long as you already have the facilities,
well, he could stay here.

46:54.977 --> 46:58.413
It's either that
or the animal shelter.

46:58.481 --> 47:01.382
And Mrs. Marston
wouldn't be very happy
if he went there.

47:03.018 --> 47:05.009
Of course, if he's too much bother--

47:05.087 --> 47:10.320
Oh, Apollo and Zeus will have to
make a few sacrifices,
but I'm sure they won't mind.

47:10.393 --> 47:14.591
Not for someone very, very special
like Sir Algernon Farnsworth.

47:16.031 --> 47:18.795
Would they, Higgins?

47:19.802 --> 47:21.770
Of course not.

47:45.795 --> 47:47.820
Sorry, lads.

47:49.899 --> 47:52.732
Cheer up, Higgins.
They'll forgive you...

47:52.802 --> 47:54.736
someday.

47:54.804 --> 47:57.238
Oh, they quite understand.

47:57.306 --> 48:00.571
Believe me, Magnum,
I've explained to them precisely...

48:00.643 --> 48:03.840
who's responsible
for their incarceration.
