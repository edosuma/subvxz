00:34.367 --> 00:36.935
Previously on <i>Californication...</i>

00:36.970 --> 00:40.005
We could actually use
a lead guitarist, you know,

00:40.040 --> 00:41.440
for that Eddie van Halen shit.

00:41.474 --> 00:42.741
What do you guys
call yourselves?

00:42.776 --> 00:43.976
- Queens of Dogtown.
- You want to know

00:44.010 --> 00:45.377
- how many women I've slept with?
- Mm-mm.

00:45.412 --> 00:47.346
No.
No, no, no.

00:47.380 --> 00:50.315
I got to get it up to 100.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.951
Triple digits,
then I can die happy.

00:52.986 --> 00:55.354
My tits are so sore.
I'm crampy as hell.

00:55.388 --> 00:58.357
And I've been throwing up
in my mouth all day long.

00:58.391 --> 01:01.627
Nice.
You're probably preggers.

01:01.661 --> 01:03.295
You are quite a slut.

01:03.329 --> 01:04.663
Because I'm
a cocky fucking attorney,

01:04.697 --> 01:06.165
and this is a great case
for me.

01:06.199 --> 01:08.667
But if you insist on dicking
around and wasting my time,

01:08.701 --> 01:09.968
I'm happy to see you rot
in jail.

01:10.003 --> 01:10.969
What the fuck do I care?

01:11.004 --> 01:13.005
Hank Moody, Sasha Bingham.

01:13.039 --> 01:14.606
Sasha Bingham.
All right, what is it you do,

01:14.641 --> 01:15.874
Sasha Bingham?

01:17.544 --> 01:18.744
How am I supposed to know that?

01:18.778 --> 01:20.512
With Sasha's interest

01:20.547 --> 01:22.147
and with Hank's face
all over the news right now,

01:22.182 --> 01:23.515
we could be at Sundance

01:23.550 --> 01:24.750
this time next year.

01:24.784 --> 01:26.218
Just get me out of it, Charlie.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.821
I can't focus on a stupid
fucking screenplay right now.

01:28.855 --> 01:29.988
I can't do that.

01:30.023 --> 01:31.623
Stu's been calling.

01:09.332 --> 01:11.233
Brilliant!

01:11.268 --> 01:14.203
Pure, unadulterated brilliance!

01:14.237 --> 01:15.871
Wow, that must have been
one hell of a dookie.

01:15.906 --> 01:17.473
You wash your hands?

01:17.507 --> 01:19.475
The script is good, Hank.

01:19.509 --> 01:21.544
It's really good.
Total game-changer.

01:21.578 --> 01:24.346
Don't say that ever again...
"game-changer".

01:24.381 --> 01:25.514
I'll kill you.

01:25.549 --> 01:27.383
You totally, totally nailed it.

01:27.417 --> 01:29.952
You took that book, and you...

01:29.986 --> 01:31.520
You made it your own.

01:31.555 --> 01:32.688
It is my own, Charlie.

01:32.723 --> 01:33.923
Right.
Right.

01:33.957 --> 01:37.960
Your words are downright
broner-inducing.

01:37.994 --> 01:40.096
Yeah, I almost pleasured myself
in there.

01:40.130 --> 01:42.631
Kind of like
a solo-blumpkin deal?

01:42.666 --> 01:44.166
Joke all you like,

01:44.201 --> 01:46.102
but my briefs
are way crowded right now.

01:46.136 --> 01:48.137
Well, I am just overjoyed
that my tales

01:48.171 --> 01:49.805
of melancholy
and the infinite sadness

01:49.840 --> 01:51.774
can induce some sort
of a reaction

01:51.808 --> 01:53.309
in you like that, old man.

01:53.343 --> 01:55.878
This is gonna be
a really good movie, Hank.

01:55.912 --> 01:59.081
I smell... I smell me
an Independent Spirit Award.

01:59.116 --> 02:02.418
Mm. You think they might get
it on demand at the state pen?

02:02.452 --> 02:03.886
Cheer up, will you, pal?

02:03.920 --> 02:05.121
This is good for both of us.

02:05.155 --> 02:07.656
You, pumping
out the literary greatness.

02:07.691 --> 02:09.892
Me, riding your coattails,
just like old times.

02:09.925 --> 02:11.827
Yes, well, as much as I enjoy

02:11.862 --> 02:13.796
a good old-fashioned
ego hummer,

02:13.830 --> 02:16.699
it is time for you
to take your leave, bald sir.

02:16.733 --> 02:19.034
I have much self-pity
in which to wallow.

02:19.069 --> 02:21.137
No, no, no.
No time to wallow.

02:21.171 --> 02:23.038
We got us a dinner date
with Stu and Zig.

02:23.073 --> 02:24.573
Zig?
What the fuck is a zig?

02:24.608 --> 02:28.644
Zig Samitaur, the billionaire.

02:28.678 --> 02:30.813
He's financing the movie,
you dumb shit.

02:30.847 --> 02:32.748
Sounds brutal.
Count me out.

02:32.783 --> 02:34.116
It is brutal, but essential.

02:34.151 --> 02:35.918
No money, no honey.

02:35.952 --> 02:37.486
Well, no can do, Runks.

02:37.521 --> 02:40.890
I got a date with my dong
and some hotel-room po'nography.

02:40.924 --> 02:43.359
The good stuff too...
penetration and everything.

02:43.393 --> 02:45.761
Your dong's gonna have to wait
till dinner's over.

02:45.796 --> 02:47.997
The moneman wants to meet him
some writer.

02:48.031 --> 02:49.198
- He's a big fan, by the way.
- Oh, shit.

02:49.232 --> 02:50.366
Big, big fan.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.067
You ever notice
when they do the editing

02:52.102 --> 02:54.036
in the hotel-room po'nography,

02:54.070 --> 02:55.704
and they take out
all the penetration

02:55.739 --> 02:57.439
and it's just pumping,
sweaty man ass,

02:57.474 --> 02:58.574
it looks like just about

02:58.608 --> 03:00.309
any Matthew McConaughey picture
ever made?

03:04.447 --> 03:14.421
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:43.353 --> 03:45.221
Isn't it a little early?

03:45.255 --> 03:47.323
What? For an itty-bitty glass
of vino?

03:47.357 --> 03:48.691
- Uh...
- Fuck you,

03:48.725 --> 03:50.259
you teetotaling buzzkill.

03:50.293 --> 03:51.427
- All right?
- Okay.

03:51.461 --> 03:53.095
Now it's time for bottoms up.

03:53.129 --> 03:54.263
That's right.

03:54.297 --> 03:55.865
Wha...

03:55.899 --> 03:58.601
Marcy, oh, God!

03:58.635 --> 04:00.736
- Sorry, Marcy.
- No.

04:00.770 --> 04:02.137
No, it's okay.

04:02.172 --> 04:03.505
Marce, I'm sorry.

04:03.540 --> 04:06.375
Thank you so much
for letting them practice here.

04:06.409 --> 04:07.610
It's fine.

04:07.644 --> 04:10.246
That's cute.

04:10.280 --> 04:12.147
Girls getting together

04:12.182 --> 04:13.482
to play the rock and roll...

04:13.516 --> 04:14.717
I like it.

04:14.751 --> 04:17.253
I like to patronize the arts.

04:17.286 --> 04:20.422
Have you heard anything
fro... from Charlie?

04:20.457 --> 04:23.225
About the trial?
Not really.

04:23.260 --> 04:25.427
I mean, I could ask,

04:25.462 --> 04:27.263
but it would mean having
an actual conversation

04:27.297 --> 04:28.497
with Butterbean himself,

04:28.531 --> 04:31.533
and I don't want him
getting the wrong idea.

04:31.568 --> 04:34.270
- Hmm.
- Why?

04:34.304 --> 04:36.572
Are you missing you
some hankness?

04:36.606 --> 04:38.507
Which one? The one I loved
or the one who fucked Mia?

04:38.541 --> 04:40.009
I don't know.

04:40.043 --> 04:42.144
All I know right now
is it all feels a little unreal.

04:42.178 --> 04:44.313
It's kind of like
a walking daymare.

04:44.347 --> 04:45.648
- Fancy-ass...
- A daymare?

04:45.682 --> 04:47.983
Yeah, it's a Hank thing.

04:48.018 --> 04:48.984
No, I think I know
what you mean.

04:49.019 --> 04:50.352
Holy fuck nuts.

04:50.387 --> 04:53.055
Where did Becca find
these miscreants... the pound?

04:53.089 --> 04:55.424
They look like a pack
of feral animals.

04:55.458 --> 04:57.259
Well, let's go to the store

04:57.294 --> 04:58.694
and get them something
to gnaw on.

04:58.728 --> 05:01.797
- And leave them here all alone?
- Yeah, they're fine.

05:01.831 --> 05:03.732
They're tough chicks.
No one's gonna mess with them.

05:03.767 --> 05:05.367
I don't give a shit about them.

05:05.402 --> 05:06.702
- I'm talking about the house.
- Come on.

05:06.736 --> 05:09.171
I don't want them sacrificing
a freaking goat in here.

05:12.842 --> 05:15.978
So can we shoot the picture
in 30 days?

05:16.012 --> 05:18.714
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely not.

05:18.748 --> 05:21.216
Maybe.
Let me look at the schedule.

05:21.251 --> 05:23.452
Hank, what do you think?

05:23.486 --> 05:26.188
Hank's not really
a shooting schedule kind of guy.

05:26.222 --> 05:27.823
Silence, agent!

05:31.494 --> 05:34.763
Well, Zig-Zag,
my work here is done.

05:34.798 --> 05:37.199
I... I really
don't give a fuck.

05:37.233 --> 05:38.701
And Sasha Bingham will star?

05:38.735 --> 05:40.903
Yes, she's reading as we speak.

05:40.937 --> 05:42.338
There's no saying no
to this draft.

05:42.372 --> 05:44.039
Hank really killed it.

05:44.074 --> 05:47.710
She is really fuckable,
isn't she?

05:47.744 --> 05:50.112
Beautiful breasts...

05:50.146 --> 05:52.681
Blow-job smile.

05:55.452 --> 05:56.885
Hank, have you made love
to her?

05:56.920 --> 05:58.821
You're quite the cocksman, no?

05:58.855 --> 06:01.523
No comment, Ziggy.
A gentleman never tells.

06:01.558 --> 06:03.025
That's true.

06:03.059 --> 06:05.327
He keeps it in his wank bank
until he's ready to pull it out

06:05.362 --> 06:06.695
and play
with his little pee-pee.

06:11.167 --> 06:13.769
Of course, I haven't had
an erection in the past decade,

06:13.803 --> 06:15.304
but that's another story.

06:15.338 --> 06:17.139
But that doesn't stop me
from giving face rides

06:17.173 --> 06:20.509
to my sister-wives,
right, ladies?

06:20.543 --> 06:22.778
My God, Zig,
you have got a way with words.

06:22.812 --> 06:25.581
Face rides to your sister-wives...
Respect.

06:29.219 --> 06:31.487
And what about Eddie Nero?

06:31.521 --> 06:33.722
- Have we, uh, locked him yet?
- He's circling.

06:33.757 --> 06:37.726
What the fuck
does that mean, agent?

06:37.761 --> 06:40.295
It's very hard
to nail him down, Zig!

06:40.330 --> 06:42.097
A little slippery!
We're doing our best!

06:42.132 --> 06:43.699
Ah, it doesn't matter.

06:43.733 --> 06:47.336
With Sasha Bingham's puddum
and her magnificent boobies,

06:47.370 --> 06:49.171
I can pre-sell
the foreign territories

06:49.205 --> 06:52.775
so that we'll be in the black
before we shoot an inch of film.

06:55.178 --> 06:57.813
Okay.

06:57.847 --> 07:01.550
To Fucking & Punching:
<i>The Movie.</i>

07:01.584 --> 07:04.987
Mm.

07:05.021 --> 07:09.191
- Here.
- God, I love that title.

07:11.728 --> 07:13.395
Mm.

07:13.430 --> 07:15.564
You and me, Hank...

07:15.598 --> 07:18.700
We know things...

07:18.735 --> 07:19.835
Dark things.

07:19.869 --> 07:21.403
Mm.

07:21.438 --> 07:23.572
I love your writing.

07:24.607 --> 07:25.808
His best yet.

07:25.842 --> 07:28.143
Screenplays bore me to tears.

07:28.178 --> 07:29.278
Word.

07:29.312 --> 07:32.214
I like to have things
acted out for me.

07:32.248 --> 07:34.183
Let's go to my house
and do a reading.

07:34.217 --> 07:35.884
Shall we?

07:35.919 --> 07:38.087
Girls, have them bring
the car around immediately.

07:38.121 --> 07:40.055
Okay?

07:44.761 --> 07:47.396
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

07:47.430 --> 07:48.497
Why do you keep saying fuck?

07:48.531 --> 07:50.032
My boobies are so big
and swollen.

07:50.066 --> 07:51.066
They're killing me.

07:51.101 --> 07:52.601
- Right.
- Here, feel.

07:52.635 --> 07:54.103
I'm good.
I'm good.

07:54.137 --> 07:57.239
- No, seriously.
- Marce...

07:57.273 --> 07:58.640
- Grab that tit. Squeeze it.
- I don't want to feel your tit.

07:58.675 --> 07:59.975
Squeeze it.

08:00.009 --> 08:01.677
Ow. Yeah.
What'd I tell you?

08:01.711 --> 08:03.412
Well, what
have I been telling you?

08:04.781 --> 08:06.381
Oh, no, Marcy, are you crying?

08:06.416 --> 08:07.583
Why are you crying?

08:07.617 --> 08:08.917
I don't know.

08:08.952 --> 08:10.886
Okay, sudden crying jags,

08:10.920 --> 08:12.554
sore boobies...

08:12.589 --> 08:14.089
- And I'm late.
- Bingo.

08:14.124 --> 08:16.024
Come on, let's go get you
a pregnancy test.

08:16.059 --> 08:18.227
And some snacks?

08:18.261 --> 08:20.929
- And some snacks.
- Ow! Jesus, woman.

08:20.964 --> 08:23.031
You're killing my titties.
I'm serious.

08:28.104 --> 08:31.073
Henry, this is
Bob's daughter Clea.

08:31.107 --> 08:33.642
Do you two know each other?

08:33.676 --> 08:35.043
Well...

08:35.078 --> 08:37.946
- No.
- I do recognize you.

08:37.981 --> 08:40.215
- No, you don't.
- Sure I do...

08:40.250 --> 08:41.850
From your book.

08:41.885 --> 08:44.553
Your picture's on the back.

08:44.587 --> 08:46.722
Ooh, what happened
to your face?

08:46.756 --> 08:49.791
Oh, this.
Uh, it's nothing.

08:49.826 --> 08:51.560
You should see the other guy.

08:51.594 --> 08:55.264
The other guy.

08:55.298 --> 08:56.565
I love it.

08:56.599 --> 08:59.635
Wow, hope
she doesn't press charges.

08:59.669 --> 09:00.836
He.
It was a he.

09:00.870 --> 09:03.172
Right.
Well, I'm off to bed.

09:03.206 --> 09:05.340
It was really nice
to meet you, Henry.

09:05.375 --> 09:08.043
Hey, she's, um...

09:08.077 --> 09:09.311
Nice.

09:09.345 --> 09:10.512
How old might she be?

09:10.547 --> 09:11.547
16.

09:11.581 --> 09:13.582
Oh, she's 16!

09:13.616 --> 09:17.519
How delightful, Hank.

09:17.554 --> 09:19.288
Very well played, by the way...

09:19.322 --> 09:21.890
So, um...

09:21.925 --> 09:24.059
Erotic.

09:24.093 --> 09:25.427
Good news, everyone.

09:25.461 --> 09:28.730
Not only have I decided
to fully finance

09:28.765 --> 09:32.601
this shining example
of art-house erotica,

09:32.635 --> 09:34.603
but I myself am in possession

09:34.637 --> 09:37.139
of my first diamond-hard
erection

09:37.173 --> 09:40.042
since the Clinton White House,

09:40.076 --> 09:42.010
thanks to you and your words,
Hank Moody.

09:42.045 --> 09:43.445
Respect.

09:43.479 --> 09:45.380
Tend to me, Tabby.

09:45.415 --> 09:46.949
Take me in your mou...
Not you, Corrine, no.

09:46.983 --> 09:48.083
You give lousy head.

09:48.117 --> 09:49.985
You're timid,
and you lack focus.

09:50.019 --> 09:51.787
We got to get you some Ritalin.

09:51.821 --> 09:53.589
Okay, come on.
Over here.

09:53.623 --> 09:55.591
Oh, yes.

09:55.625 --> 09:58.794
Oh.

09:58.828 --> 10:02.064
Oh, yes.

10:02.098 --> 10:03.465
Isn't this wonderful, Hank?

10:03.499 --> 10:05.234
Oh.
Ohh.

10:05.268 --> 10:07.736
- Mm.
- You and me...

10:07.770 --> 10:09.605
Men together.

10:11.207 --> 10:12.941
Hmm.

10:12.976 --> 10:14.843
Oh, Corrine, see how gentle

10:14.877 --> 10:15.944
and subtle she is.

10:15.979 --> 10:18.780
Oh.

10:18.815 --> 10:20.916
He doesn't like you, agent.

10:20.950 --> 10:23.819
He smells your fear,
your weakness.

10:23.853 --> 10:25.320
How does that make you feel?

10:25.355 --> 10:26.989
He could put on a suit

10:27.023 --> 10:29.491
and do your job, and no one
would know the difference.

10:32.662 --> 10:34.162
All right, all right,
that's enough, that's enough.

10:34.197 --> 10:37.966
I don't want to waste
this magnificent erection

10:38.001 --> 10:40.269
on a silly suck and fuck.

10:40.303 --> 10:43.805
I'll be back, and then
we will finish the performance.

10:43.840 --> 10:47.643
Keep these boys entertained,
will you?

10:47.677 --> 10:50.112
Show 'em what you got.

10:50.146 --> 10:53.882
I'll be back.

10:53.916 --> 10:57.386
Well, who wants to get baked?

10:57.420 --> 10:59.521
All right, then.

11:00.857 --> 11:03.225
All right.
Up high.

11:03.259 --> 11:04.860
Hey, I'll take one of those.

11:04.894 --> 11:06.094
What do you say?

11:06.129 --> 11:07.462
What?

11:16.773 --> 11:19.408
♪ Well, I raped your mother today ♪

11:19.442 --> 11:21.443

- Marce.
- You know what?

11:47.070 --> 11:48.103
I don't want to know.

11:48.137 --> 11:50.572
Come on. No.
You need to find out.

11:50.606 --> 11:51.807
Did you see

11:51.841 --> 11:54.743
those hideous
fucking creatures downstairs?

11:54.777 --> 11:56.712
- I don't want one of those!
- Marce, I swear,

11:56.746 --> 11:58.847
that does not happen
for a long time.

11:58.881 --> 12:00.615
They're...
At first, they're so cute.

12:00.650 --> 12:01.983
I mean, they're so...

12:02.018 --> 12:03.919
Yeah, shitting and pissing
all over the place

12:03.953 --> 12:05.520
and making
my fucking nipples bleed...

12:05.555 --> 12:07.322
That's really fucking cute.

12:07.357 --> 12:08.390
No, thank you.

12:08.424 --> 12:09.825
- Marce.
- Kill me now!

12:09.859 --> 12:12.527
Let's just do it.
Come on, let's do this thing.

12:12.562 --> 12:13.562
You need to...

12:13.596 --> 12:15.130
Fine!

12:15.164 --> 12:17.065
Fine.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.266
Let's do this.

12:18.301 --> 12:20.202
All right!

12:20.236 --> 12:23.171
Let's get
this golden shower started.

12:23.206 --> 12:25.574
Open up and say pee.

12:33.449 --> 12:35.751
- Hmm.
- Oh.

12:35.785 --> 12:37.352
Hmm.

12:37.387 --> 12:41.089
This is like...
This is like <i>The Virgin Suicides</i>

12:41.124 --> 12:42.457
meets the yule log.

12:42.492 --> 12:43.625
I cannot look away.

12:43.659 --> 12:45.694
Hey, are you guys
really sisters,

12:45.728 --> 12:48.230
or is this kind of like
a white stripes deal?

12:48.264 --> 12:51.032
Oh, better not.

12:51.067 --> 12:53.468
I can't.
All right, you know what?

12:53.503 --> 12:56.238
T.S.T.B.

12:56.272 --> 13:00.776
T.S.T.B....
Too stoned to ball.

13:00.810 --> 13:04.045
Aw.

13:04.080 --> 13:05.680
Oh, Stu.

13:05.715 --> 13:06.782
Stu.

13:06.816 --> 13:08.450
No, back off, fuck toys.

13:08.484 --> 13:11.086
This producer
is looking for love.

13:11.120 --> 13:14.055
This guy, up here.

13:14.090 --> 13:15.757
- <i>Moi?</i>
- Yes, please.

13:15.792 --> 13:18.260
Well, maybe just for a minute.

13:18.294 --> 13:21.797
Mm, you smell
like cigarettes and champagne

13:21.831 --> 13:24.099
and cool ranch doritos.

13:24.133 --> 13:26.635
And it makes me strangely hard.

13:26.669 --> 13:28.770
Number 17.

13:28.805 --> 13:30.972
How do you like them apples?

13:31.007 --> 13:33.508
- See you guys later.
- Apples and doritos...

13:33.543 --> 13:35.377
Stu, that sounds
pretty good to me.

13:35.411 --> 13:36.945
- You hungry?
- A little bit...

13:36.979 --> 13:38.013
A little, little bit.

13:38.047 --> 13:42.918
Shit. Fuck.
The rabbit done died.

13:42.952 --> 13:44.252
I'm sorry, baby.

13:44.287 --> 13:47.155
Okay, quick.

13:47.190 --> 13:49.090
Punch me in the stomach.

13:49.125 --> 13:50.959
- Go.
- You have options.

13:50.993 --> 13:52.861
- Oh, really?
- Uh-huh.

13:52.895 --> 13:56.031
Okay, my options are I either
have a fucking abortion,

13:56.065 --> 13:57.933
or I have a fucking baby.

13:57.967 --> 14:00.268
Those are what's
commonly known as options.

14:00.303 --> 14:04.606
Okay, so I could either vacuum
this nightmare out of my twat,

14:04.640 --> 14:07.609
or I could settle in
for the burden of a lifetime.

14:07.643 --> 14:08.910
Is there anything else?

14:08.945 --> 14:10.479
Is there something
behind door number three?

14:10.513 --> 14:13.615
Oh, how did this happen
to me, Karenina?

14:13.649 --> 14:16.184
Why does <i>Hashem</i> hate me?

14:16.219 --> 14:18.086
Fuck.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.821
Okay, so who... whose is it?

14:19.856 --> 14:20.956
I don't know.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.757
- Is it Charlie's?
- Fuck, no.

14:22.792 --> 14:24.493
That kid's all snipped
to shreds.

14:24.527 --> 14:26.061
It can't be him.

14:26.095 --> 14:28.497
It's not Rick Springfield.

14:28.531 --> 14:30.732
Uh-uh.
He was all about the ass.

14:30.766 --> 14:31.900
- Nice.
- Yeah.

14:31.934 --> 14:33.034
Plus, he never came.

14:33.069 --> 14:35.303
- What?
- No, we'd fuck for hours.

14:35.338 --> 14:37.372
I'd come nine times.
He'd shoot a puff of smoke.

14:37.406 --> 14:39.207
Can't be that dude.

14:39.242 --> 14:41.076
There were a couple

14:41.110 --> 14:44.212
of Craigslist
"casual encounters"

14:44.247 --> 14:46.715
- here and there...
- Okay.

14:46.749 --> 14:48.483
But I never let 'em
raw-dog me.

14:48.518 --> 14:49.885
Okay.

14:49.919 --> 14:51.086
So, shit.

14:51.120 --> 14:53.221
It could be
an immaculate conception.

14:54.824 --> 14:58.693
What? I'm not good enough
to get knocked up by God?

14:58.728 --> 14:59.694
Fuck you.

14:59.729 --> 15:01.963
Some friend you are!

15:01.998 --> 15:04.366
Come get some rest.
Lie down.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.501
I can't rest,
because your fucking child

15:06.536 --> 15:08.403
is playing devil music
in my living room.

15:08.437 --> 15:09.771
No, no, no, it's okay.
I'll go get them to stop.

15:09.805 --> 15:12.007
No, no, no, good...
They're good.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.542
Let 'em play.
I like it.

15:13.576 --> 15:15.310
It's fine.
I'll be fine.

15:17.580 --> 15:19.881
Do you think I'd make
a good mom?

15:19.916 --> 15:23.151
Yes, I think you'd make
a great mom.

15:23.185 --> 15:24.986
Fucking-a, right.

15:25.021 --> 15:30.759
That little mutant
would be lucky to have me.

15:33.763 --> 15:36.565
Are you sure you're into this?

15:36.599 --> 15:39.034
Oh, yes.
Take me, agent.

15:39.068 --> 15:41.436
I only ask
because I'm... I'm encountering

15:41.470 --> 15:43.238
sort of a lack
of lubrication here.

15:43.272 --> 15:45.307
Oh, it's okay.
I can grin and bear it.

15:45.341 --> 15:47.075
It'll feel like I'm a "wirgin."

15:47.109 --> 15:49.678
- A "wirgin"?
- Mm-hmm.

15:49.712 --> 15:50.879
Like virgin,
but with a "w."

15:50.913 --> 15:52.414
It sounds super creepy
that way.

15:52.448 --> 15:55.917
Yes.
Yes, it really does.

15:55.952 --> 15:57.986
Well...

15:58.020 --> 16:00.055
Okay, then.

16:00.089 --> 16:02.157
Here we go.

16:07.563 --> 16:09.331
Am I doing something wrong?

16:09.365 --> 16:11.232
I'm... I'm not averse
to a little guidance here.

16:11.267 --> 16:13.501
It's not you.
It's him.

16:14.971 --> 16:16.938
I can't screw
with him watching us.

16:16.973 --> 16:18.607
He's got that gleam in his eye.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.178
Well, we're all
just mammals here.

16:23.212 --> 16:24.312
No.

16:24.347 --> 16:25.413
No, you don't understand.

16:25.448 --> 16:27.415
He tried to finger
my friend Jess one time.

16:27.450 --> 16:29.084
He is highly sexual.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.819
Just get him out of here.

16:30.853 --> 16:32.821
Jeez, what is he throwing
at me?

16:32.855 --> 16:34.589
- His poo.
- His poo?

16:34.624 --> 16:35.590
Jesus Christ.

16:35.625 --> 16:38.393
That is one antisocial monkey.

16:38.427 --> 16:41.896
God! Ew!

16:41.931 --> 16:44.132
Kong, would you get the fuck
out of here?

16:44.166 --> 16:45.567
Jeez.

16:45.601 --> 16:47.569
Ew!

16:47.603 --> 16:50.305
Aah!

16:50.339 --> 16:52.674
Kong!

16:52.708 --> 16:54.809
Ow! Get it off!

16:54.844 --> 16:56.578
Get it off!
Get it off!

17:01.117 --> 17:03.151
Aah!

17:16.232 --> 17:19.367
Kong is dead!

17:19.402 --> 17:21.202
- Long live Kong.
- Who is Kong?

17:21.237 --> 17:22.871
The monkey.

17:22.905 --> 17:25.707
That bald scumbag murdered
our monkey.

17:25.741 --> 17:27.175
I committed no such act.

17:27.209 --> 17:28.843
It was self-defense.

17:28.878 --> 17:31.146
- You killed the monkey?
- No.

17:31.180 --> 17:32.881
I tracked down
the one man in this city

17:32.915 --> 17:35.717
who's got the dough to pull off
my fucking passion project,

17:35.751 --> 17:37.686
and you killed
his fucking monkey?

17:37.720 --> 17:40.188
It was an accident, I swear.

17:40.222 --> 17:42.590
That monkey was a deviant
and a cockblocker.

17:42.625 --> 17:45.326
He was throwing
his fecal matter at me!

17:45.361 --> 17:46.695
And he bit my fucking arm!

17:46.729 --> 17:48.029
Murderer!

17:48.064 --> 17:49.431
Runks...

17:49.465 --> 17:50.899
Killing an innocent monkey

17:50.933 --> 17:52.634
in the name
of getting some poon.

17:52.668 --> 17:53.902
Is nothing sacred?

17:53.936 --> 17:55.770
No one has to know about this.

17:55.805 --> 17:57.839
I say we abscond
with that corpse.

17:57.873 --> 17:59.207
We take it up to Griffith Park,

17:59.241 --> 18:01.009
and we put that little
turd-fondler six feet under.

18:01.043 --> 18:02.410
What do you need?
Huh?

18:02.445 --> 18:04.746
- Hush money-wise?
- Hey, hey, shut up.

18:04.780 --> 18:06.781
Take a look
at the eye in the sky.

18:06.816 --> 18:08.850
Hello.
Yeah.

18:08.884 --> 18:11.519
Look, they're in every room.
That means we're fucked.

18:11.554 --> 18:12.721
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

18:12.755 --> 18:16.191
So listen up,
you giant botcher.

18:16.225 --> 18:19.761
We have only one play here.

18:19.795 --> 18:22.564
And that is for you
to come clean

18:22.598 --> 18:25.533
and tell Zig
before he finds out.

18:25.568 --> 18:28.403
I want you to march
into that man's bedroom...

18:30.005 --> 18:34.209
And tell him
you killed his fucking monkey!

18:34.243 --> 18:35.810
I don't want to do that.

18:35.845 --> 18:37.145
I'll take you.
Come on.

18:37.179 --> 18:40.582
Come on.
Come on.

18:40.616 --> 18:45.086
Get out of here,
you fucking moron.

18:50.459 --> 18:52.727
Hey.

18:52.762 --> 18:54.162
Make yourself at home.

18:54.196 --> 18:56.464
Sorry.
Sorry.

18:56.499 --> 18:57.665
I was... I was knocking,

18:57.700 --> 19:00.668
and I was ringing,
and... and no one answered.

19:00.703 --> 19:02.904
So what,
you just let yourself in?

19:02.938 --> 19:06.541
Well, the door was open,
and, uh, my girl was inside.

19:06.575 --> 19:08.476
What would you do?

19:08.511 --> 19:10.245
Oh, okay, okay, I get it.

19:10.279 --> 19:11.946
Uh, the exact same thing.

19:11.981 --> 19:14.282
Hmm.

19:14.316 --> 19:16.918
Which hell spawn is yours?

19:16.952 --> 19:19.854
Pearl...
The one with the pipes.

19:19.889 --> 19:21.556
Mm-hmm.

19:21.590 --> 19:23.858
Mine's Becca,
the one with the bangs.

19:23.893 --> 19:26.261
A-ha.
She's pretty fierce, that one.

19:26.295 --> 19:28.596
- Mm-hmm.
- Tasty licks.

19:28.631 --> 19:30.832
And you are?

19:30.866 --> 19:33.802
I'm sorry.
I'm Ben.

19:33.836 --> 19:35.603
- Karen. Nice to meet you.
- Karen.

19:35.638 --> 19:37.038
Nice to meet you too.

19:38.741 --> 19:43.044
Well, um, here you go, Karen.

19:43.078 --> 19:45.013
You know, not many people

19:45.047 --> 19:46.948
can actually say
they have a picture

19:46.982 --> 19:48.383
of the exact moment
they met someone

19:48.417 --> 19:50.151
for the first time,
so there you go...

19:50.186 --> 19:51.853
My gift to you.

19:53.222 --> 19:56.391
I think
this is going really well.

19:56.425 --> 19:58.393
Hello?

19:58.427 --> 20:00.562
- Zig.
- Zig.

20:00.596 --> 20:02.163
You freaky bastard, Zig.

20:02.198 --> 20:05.967
Zig, we got
a-a-a little situation out here.

20:06.001 --> 20:09.304
Kind of a minor
monkey incident happening.

20:11.073 --> 20:13.875
Ah, Zig or no Zig,
I got to take a waz.

20:13.909 --> 20:17.111
♪ ♪

20:17.146 --> 20:20.315
Hello?

20:20.349 --> 20:22.784
♪ Eat my peach, baby, blow on my dice ♪

20:22.818 --> 20:24.786

20:24.820 --> 20:26.487
Zi... Hey.

20:30.426 --> 20:32.427
Charlie!

20:32.461 --> 20:35.363
Charlie, we got a bit
of a predicament in here.

20:35.397 --> 20:37.532
What?

20:46.442 --> 20:49.143
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, what the fuck's going on in here?

20:49.178 --> 20:51.412
Hey, Runkle,
how did Zig take the news?

20:51.447 --> 20:54.249
Not so well, actually.

20:54.283 --> 20:55.350
Oh, God!

20:56.619 --> 20:58.987
Come on!
Sweet mother of God!

20:59.021 --> 21:00.822
Runkle, did you do that to him?

21:00.856 --> 21:02.724
No, I did not do that to him.

21:02.758 --> 21:04.759
We came in here,
and that's how he was.

21:04.793 --> 21:07.562
I mean, I am not averse to
the occasional choke and stroke,

21:07.596 --> 21:08.763
but this is a prime example

21:08.797 --> 21:10.932
of why one must always use
the buddy system.

21:10.966 --> 21:13.067
This is not good.
This is not good at all.

21:13.102 --> 21:15.136
On the bright side,
it makes the whole monkey thing

21:15.170 --> 21:17.238
a bit less of a snafu,
doesn't it?

21:17.273 --> 21:19.274
- That's a good point.
- That is true.

21:19.308 --> 21:20.909
On the other hand, it's gonna
be hard to make <i>F&P: The Movie</i>

21:20.943 --> 21:22.410
without creepy Warbucks
over here.

21:22.444 --> 21:25.914
Oh, it makes it impossible.

21:25.948 --> 21:27.882
Anyway, it was a pleasure

21:27.917 --> 21:29.717
almost working with you.

21:29.752 --> 21:31.886
And, yeah.

21:31.921 --> 21:34.589
You can't go anywhere.
We got a serious situation here.

21:34.623 --> 21:35.924
The fuck I can't.

21:35.958 --> 21:39.160
Dead monkeys
and autoerotic asphyxiation,

21:39.194 --> 21:40.528
that's my cue.

21:40.562 --> 21:42.463
I was never here.

21:42.498 --> 21:43.965
What?

21:43.999 --> 21:46.167
Not exactly a "going down
with the ship" type, is he?

21:46.201 --> 21:48.870
What the fuck, Hank?
What do we do now?

21:48.904 --> 21:50.571
You have to stop yelling,
firstly.

21:50.606 --> 21:52.507
Ooh, kind of touching
the dead guy there.

21:52.541 --> 21:53.741
Don't do that.

21:53.776 --> 21:55.109
Shouldn't we take him down
or something?

21:55.144 --> 21:56.544
Nothing good can come of that,
I assure you.

21:56.578 --> 21:57.712
Jesus.

21:57.746 --> 22:00.114
He really liked the script,
though, huh?

22:00.149 --> 22:03.117
He must have.
I'm flattered...Kind of.

22:03.152 --> 22:05.753
- Oh, Hank, I'm scared.
- Yeah.

22:05.788 --> 22:07.188
This is really dark.

22:07.222 --> 22:09.057
This is way, way, way dark.

22:09.091 --> 22:11.793
We got to make this go away.
Hold me, please.

22:11.827 --> 22:13.695
Cool your jets, Runks.

22:13.729 --> 22:16.831
I got a guy.

22:22.571 --> 22:25.239
- Oh, shit, Hank. Shit, Hank.
- Be cool, Runks.

22:25.274 --> 22:28.042
- Shit, shit, shit.
- Maintain.

22:32.581 --> 22:33.948
What's going on here, fellas?

22:33.983 --> 22:36.150
Just rocking out
with our cocks out.

22:36.185 --> 22:38.987
Oh, one of those parties, huh?
Okay.

22:39.021 --> 22:40.588
And where's Mr., uh, Samitaur?

22:40.622 --> 22:42.991
He's inside...

22:43.025 --> 22:45.460
- In the bathroom.
- Just hanging out.

22:45.494 --> 22:47.495
Okay. You mind
if I have a word with him?

22:47.529 --> 22:50.565
Looks like somebody hit
the panic button, so...

22:50.599 --> 22:53.167
He's a fucking murderer!

22:53.202 --> 22:54.302
Allow me to explain.

22:54.336 --> 22:55.937
Whoa!

22:55.971 --> 22:59.607
Oh, yeah.
What, huh?

22:59.641 --> 23:01.142
- You want some of this?
- No, I don't want any of it.

23:01.176 --> 23:02.310
You want some of this,
midnight cowboy?

23:02.344 --> 23:05.279
Let's go.

23:22.164 --> 23:23.231
What the fuck, Hank?

23:23.265 --> 23:24.932
Well, thank you so much
for coming.

23:24.967 --> 23:26.200
Tell me.

23:26.235 --> 23:29.037
One dead billionaire,
one dead monkey.

23:29.071 --> 23:32.907
Autoerotic asphyxiation...
the billionaire, not the monkey.

23:32.941 --> 23:34.675
- Wow, really?
- Shit happens.

23:34.710 --> 23:36.110
Is he okay?

23:36.145 --> 23:38.112
Oh, yeah, he just got tased.

23:38.147 --> 23:40.114
- And him?
- Him I knocked out.

23:40.149 --> 23:41.883
Don't be tasing my agent,
motherfucker.

23:41.917 --> 23:43.317
Okay, self-defense.

23:43.352 --> 23:45.319
Oh, I like that.
What's the move?

23:45.354 --> 23:46.487
Depends.

23:46.522 --> 23:48.256
Did you actually
do anything illegal?

23:48.290 --> 23:50.625
Is there something
you're not telling me?

23:53.495 --> 23:56.798
I did watch two sisters
take off their clothes

23:56.832 --> 23:58.666
and make out with each other.

23:58.700 --> 24:01.836
And that made my wiener
feel a little weird.

24:01.870 --> 24:03.571
Mm, yeah, that's...
That's gross.

24:03.605 --> 24:05.373
But I don't believe
that that's illegal.

24:05.407 --> 24:06.641
- No, it's not illegal.
- Not illegal.

24:06.675 --> 24:08.476
- Okay, uh, we call...
- Maybe it should be.

24:08.510 --> 24:09.977
We call 911.
You give a statement.

24:10.012 --> 24:11.345
I ask for a favor.

24:11.380 --> 24:13.014
We make sure it doesn't end up
all over the press.

24:13.048 --> 24:14.348
Wow, no,
that's grace under pressure.

24:14.383 --> 24:15.683
I dig that in a woman.

24:15.717 --> 24:17.718
And you look
smokin' hot tonight.

24:17.753 --> 24:19.387
You got a big date?

24:19.421 --> 24:20.955
You know what?
It's strange.

24:20.989 --> 24:23.257
A part of me is really quite
pissed off at you right now,

24:23.292 --> 24:25.426
because your idea of staying
out of trouble sucks balls,

24:25.461 --> 24:28.129
but the other part,
I don't know,

24:28.163 --> 24:30.798
it feels vaguely proud of you.

24:30.833 --> 24:32.333
- Proud?
- Uh-huh.

24:32.367 --> 24:34.802
I don't think there's much
to be proud of here tonight.

24:34.837 --> 24:36.671
A debauched party,
a couple of dead primates...

24:36.705 --> 24:38.239
not really worthy
of a gold star.

24:38.273 --> 24:41.476
No, you absolutely
screwed the pooch, but, uh...

24:41.510 --> 24:44.145
Calling me shows at least
a modicum of sense

24:44.179 --> 24:47.048
and, uh,
more than a little trust.

24:47.082 --> 24:49.584
Sensible and trusting.

24:49.618 --> 24:52.720
That's me
in a nutshell, really.

24:52.754 --> 24:54.956
How high are you right now?

24:54.990 --> 24:57.391
- Hmm?
- How high are you?

24:57.426 --> 25:00.128
- Significantly.
- Yeah.

25:00.162 --> 25:03.131
All right.
Let me deal with this.

25:08.237 --> 25:11.272
You okay, buddboy?

25:11.306 --> 25:13.341
I feel like ass...

25:13.375 --> 25:15.710
- Like a great, big slab of ass.
- Yeah.

25:15.744 --> 25:16.978
Well, look on the bright side.

25:17.012 --> 25:18.846
You inched closer
to your magic number.

25:18.881 --> 25:20.948
It was just the tip, Hank.

25:20.983 --> 25:22.650
- It doesn't count.
- The tip counts.

25:22.684 --> 25:24.018
You think?

25:24.052 --> 25:25.853
Fucking-a.
The tip always counts.

25:25.888 --> 25:29.056
- The tip counts?
- Yeah.

25:29.091 --> 25:30.858
Hold your shit together,
Chunkle.

25:30.893 --> 25:33.127
Tomorrow's another day
in the dream factory.

25:36.398 --> 25:38.866
Don't blame yourself,
buddy boy.

25:38.901 --> 25:40.902
I got blood on my hands, Hank.

25:40.936 --> 25:42.803
Seriously, I don't know
if I'm gonna sleep tonight.

25:42.838 --> 25:44.639
Every time I close my eyes,

25:44.673 --> 25:48.376
I see that sweet
little monkey's face.

25:48.410 --> 25:51.212
Marcy?

25:56.218 --> 25:57.418
You want to come in?

25:57.452 --> 26:00.488
What, and tuck you in,
read you a bedtime story?

26:00.522 --> 26:01.489
No.

26:01.523 --> 26:03.991
Your lady's chariot.

26:07.963 --> 26:09.964
I don't think they want
to see me, Charlie.

26:09.998 --> 26:12.733
When has that ever stopped you?

26:12.768 --> 26:15.803
