09:48.822 --> 09:50.855
Now, where the heck...
Hey, how'd you get over there?

09:50.857 --> 09:52.824
Don't do that! Oh, man!

10:00.132 --> 10:01.600
Okay, now you're
just showing off.

10:04.136 --> 10:07.472
What? Is there
something I should...
(YELLS)

10:07.474 --> 10:10.508
I fail to see how this
could get any worse.

10:12.211 --> 10:13.778
Curse you,
Perry the Platypus...

10:18.284 --> 10:20.652
What the... I'm pretty sure
that's not supposed to happen.

10:23.356 --> 10:28.393
Mr. Stevens, I'm having
trouble with the equipment!

10:28.395 --> 10:30.829
(CROWD CHEERING)
MOM: Sorry, excuse me.
Yes, you are number one.

10:30.831 --> 10:34.332
Excuse me. Sorry, pardon me.
All right, now I gotta...
Excuse me!

10:34.334 --> 10:37.335
Oh, check it out,
a monster ice
polishing machine!

10:37.337 --> 10:39.371
Okay, everyone,
looks like we're done.
Let's get out of here.

10:47.213 --> 10:50.649
Oh, my gosh.
That is the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.450
Everyone say
"Canadian bacon."

10:52.452 --> 10:53.518
ALL: Ham!

10:55.721 --> 10:58.857
Great job, kids.
That was the weirdest game
of hockey I've ever seen.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.358
Thanks,
Mr. Robitaille!

11:00.360 --> 11:01.993
Okay, I'm all set
to sneak across the ice.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.828
Go ahead.
Hockey Z9 is over.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.330
What? No!

11:05.332 --> 11:07.632
Mom, they had
giant dangerous...
With a...

11:07.634 --> 11:09.300
It's not fair!

11:09.302 --> 11:11.703
It's so not fair!
(WHISTLES)

11:11.705 --> 11:13.471
Unsportsmanlike behavior!

11:13.473 --> 11:14.906
Fine.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.775
Wow, Candace.
I had a really good time.

11:16.777 --> 11:21.379
Oh, that sounds like fun.
But give me two minutes.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.847
Oh, there you are, Perry.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.249
(CHATTERING)
