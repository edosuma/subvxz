00:10.311 --> 00:13.312
(needle down on to record)
(static & record scratching)

00:14.015 --> 00:15.714
(percussive score)

00:38.105 --> 00:40.072
(marching snare drum beat)

00:47.248 --> 00:50.149
- NUNZIATA: Councillor Fletcher,
questions to staff.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.757
- FLETCHER: This is
actually about

00:58.759 --> 01:00.659
the name...

01:07.134 --> 01:08.467
Well, the report's called

01:08.469 --> 01:11.637
"To Facilitate CouncilLor
Office Operations"

01:14.742 --> 01:18.177
I think the word "office",
and you might disagree,

01:18.179 --> 01:20.079
should be clarified.

01:24.318 --> 01:27.352
Perhaps it's a poor
choice of a word.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.325
- But I'm not sure
that I would agree.

01:33.327 --> 01:36.562
- FLETCHER: But what does
"office" mean to you?

01:39.767 --> 01:42.601
- Councillor, I'm not sure
how I'm supposed to answer

01:42.603 --> 01:44.303
that question.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.680
- FLETCHER: Well, there's
been criticisms in the past

01:54.682 --> 01:57.883
of how councillors have spent
their money. It's been said:

01:57.885 --> 02:02.421
"Well, that isn't something
you need to run your 'office'."

02:09.363 --> 02:11.864
The notion of this
being something

02:11.866 --> 02:14.800
to run an 'office'...

02:20.174 --> 02:21.840
versus something

02:21.842 --> 02:24.443
that is a general expense,

02:24.778 --> 02:27.546
hasn't been clearly defined.

02:30.918 --> 02:33.118
Would you agree with that?

02:33.120 --> 02:34.853
- CLAIRE: Wait, is that
your actual question?

02:34.855 --> 02:36.221
What a line item
should be called?

02:36.223 --> 02:37.589
- ZACH: The question's what
the report is called.

02:37.591 --> 02:38.924
And it's so she
can make a point.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.292
- So, can we just
get to the point?

02:40.294 --> 02:41.660
- JOSHUA: You guys
are on the same side.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.028
He's voting the same
as she is, isn't he?

02:43.030 --> 02:44.530
- Yeah, but Joe's not
gonna want to sit here

02:44.532 --> 02:46.532
for an extra hour discussing
what a line item

02:46.534 --> 02:47.332
should be called.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.534
- ZACH: I'm not on the same side

02:48.536 --> 02:50.035
and it's not a line item,
it's a report.

02:50.037 --> 02:52.638
- Um, yes, we are,
and yes it is.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.673
- Lauren? Are Fletcher
and Mihevc both backing?

02:54.675 --> 02:56.842
- LAUREN: What?
- Zach's voting same as me.

02:56.844 --> 02:57.976
- Is that a question?

02:57.978 --> 02:59.111
- It shouldn't be.

02:59.113 --> 03:00.646
- I'm sorry, I'm
not following here.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.381
- Are Mihevc and Fletcher voting
with Catracchia. Guys, come on.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.782
- LAUREN: I mean, I hope so?

03:03.784 --> 03:05.150
- Is that a question?

03:05.152 --> 03:07.853
- Sorry. What's the--
what's the, um, issue here?

03:07.855 --> 03:10.389
- Claire isn't sure
if we're voting the same.

03:10.391 --> 03:13.091
- No, Zachary, I'm sure.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.560
- No, I mean, what issue
are we discussing?

03:14.562 --> 03:17.429
Is it, um, heritage designation?
Where are we?

03:17.431 --> 03:18.397
- Someone make a beer run?

03:18.666 --> 03:19.698
- It's past nine.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.800
- Why are we arguing
about office expenses--

03:21.802 --> 03:24.736
- Office expenses! Yes, um, we
are voting the same. Same vote.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.271
- KAMAL: We should all
make a motion to allow

03:26.273 --> 03:28.040
convenience stores
to sell booze.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.641
Isn't that what
the people want?

03:29.643 --> 03:30.909
- Maybe your people.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.712
- Your people? Is that a racist
thing or an elitist thing?

03:33.714 --> 03:35.581
- Uh, it's provincial.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.382
- Oh, so the opposite
of elitist?

03:37.384 --> 03:39.518
- Uh, booze laws
are provincial,

03:39.520 --> 03:41.820
as in the province handles it.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.755
No one uses the other
"provincial" anymore,

03:43.757 --> 03:46.558
unless you're an elitist,
which apparently you are.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.260
Better not let
your boss find out

03:48.262 --> 03:50.629
he's got an east coast-valued
elitist in his ranks

03:50.631 --> 03:53.131
who's using words
like "provincial"

03:53.133 --> 03:55.400
when words like "hick"
exist in 2012.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.736
- So you're just
skipping over me.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.806
- Is there anything in there
you want to run by us, Zach?

04:00.808 --> 04:03.942
- Well, you guys'll
just nay-say it, so--

04:03.944 --> 04:05.277
- Then I wouldn't run it by us.

04:05.279 --> 04:06.979
- We're saying each
councillor should be given

04:06.981 --> 04:10.182
an increase of $1,000 to
their office budget each month.

04:10.184 --> 04:11.783
- We have 45 offices.

04:11.785 --> 04:14.519
- By office, are we saying the
actual physical structure...

04:14.521 --> 04:16.088
- That's 45 grand a month.

04:16.090 --> 04:18.023
<i> ...or "office"</i> like how we
refer to the White House?

04:18.025 --> 04:19.558
- 540-thousand a year.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.493
- Wait, why are we talking
about the White House?

04:21.495 --> 04:23.328
- How many physical
offices do you count, Zach?

04:23.330 --> 04:25.931
- I just think we need to
clarify if the change applies to

04:25.933 --> 04:28.400
the office or the "office".

04:28.402 --> 04:29.401
- Are you serious right now?

04:29.403 --> 04:30.769
- You guys are all
on the same side.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.471
- Who cares what the
report is called?

04:32.473 --> 04:34.673
- If it sounds like it's just
for a physical office space

04:34.675 --> 04:37.142
and we use it for
office travel expenses,

04:37.144 --> 04:39.678
we're going to get
mini-crucified.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.880
- Oh...

04:42.783 --> 04:44.383
Okay, I get it now.

04:44.785 --> 04:48.320
Yes, no, we do need
to clarify that, guys.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.088
- Look, Claire,

04:50.090 --> 04:51.490
Fletcher and Joe
are going to argue about

04:51.492 --> 04:52.858
what the report is called
to try to justify

04:52.860 --> 04:56.161
using $500,000 which we
already cut from the budget

04:56.163 --> 04:57.596
and people are
happy about it.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.665
And people are actually
happy with the government!

04:59.667 --> 05:02.100
You'll say, that this is
better for the people somehow

05:02.102 --> 05:03.235
but all the people--

05:03.237 --> 05:04.636
that's you and me,

05:04.638 --> 05:06.605
I'm not speaking
councillor-speak here, guys,

05:06.607 --> 05:08.840
I just care about
paying less taxes.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.042
I can't pay my phone bill.

05:10.044 --> 05:11.977
I don't want to pay more taxes
for office expenses

05:11.979 --> 05:14.446
and you guys are going
to try to rename a report

05:14.448 --> 05:16.281
so that you can use
money which we don't have

05:16.283 --> 05:17.783
to use for your office?

05:17.785 --> 05:19.017
- But--
- Yes, Zach.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.620
Conceptual "office" like
The White House or 10 Downing

05:21.622 --> 05:24.222
or whatever the fuck
our equivalent is.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.325
- You know, my long
distance is insane

05:26.327 --> 05:29.194
and I bet the White House
uses their office expenses

05:29.196 --> 05:30.796
to pay for their
assistants' phone bill.

05:30.798 --> 05:32.564
- The White House calls
Russia once a week.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.566
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that Obama and Putin

05:34.568 --> 05:36.668
are not having a weekly
catch-up sesh.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.203
- The furthest you
should be calling

05:38.205 --> 05:40.939
for your municipal councillor is
seven blocks from your office.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.441
- Physical, Zach.

05:43.077 --> 05:46.211
- Can we please just figure out
how to bring this city together

05:46.213 --> 05:48.046
and allow convenience
stores to sell alcohol

05:48.048 --> 05:49.948
whenever people want so that
we don't have to spend

05:49.950 --> 05:52.284
10 bucks on a beer whenever
the government liquor stores

05:52.286 --> 05:53.385
are closed?

05:53.387 --> 05:54.720
- ALL: Cheers! Cheers!

05:54.722 --> 05:55.787
- Thank you.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.858
(percussive score continues)

06:17.745 --> 06:19.611
- BRAM: Sorry, hi, I have an
interview. Can I just--

06:19.613 --> 06:21.279
- GIRL IN LINE:
There's a line, buddy.

06:21.281 --> 06:22.581
- Yeah, no, no,
I know. I just--

06:22.583 --> 06:24.850
- Wanted to butt the line?

06:27.121 --> 06:28.086
(sighs)

06:28.088 --> 06:29.287
- I don't know if
butting the line

06:29.289 --> 06:30.655
is a thing past
elementary school.

06:30.657 --> 06:32.391
- It's not.

06:34.461 --> 06:35.761
- JASON: Hey, man.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.295
Thought the only lines
you did are the fun ones.

06:37.297 --> 06:38.630
- Trigger warning: lines.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.098
- Trigger warning: douchebags.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.333
- Oh, trigger warning:

06:41.335 --> 06:42.367
girl who petitioned
for trigger warnings.

06:42.369 --> 06:43.602
- Triggers are
the new spoilers.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.837
- Spoiler alert:
your bro's a prick.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.439
- Okay, if you didn't know
that literally anything

06:47.441 --> 06:48.774
by Sylvia Plath
was about suicide,

06:48.776 --> 06:50.108
you shouldn't have been
in fourth year literature.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.009
- JASON: Multiple spoiler alert.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.177
- Next?

06:52.179 --> 06:53.378
- Can you let
these two go ahead

06:53.380 --> 06:55.180
so I don't need to stand
in front of them any more?

06:55.182 --> 06:56.882
- Yeah, thank you.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.083
- THE MOUSE: Name?

06:58.085 --> 06:59.684
- Bram Shriver.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.088
- Let me see here...
When did you register?

07:03.390 --> 07:04.823
- For what?

07:04.825 --> 07:06.124
- Convocation.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.326
- Uh, when I registered
to study here for four years

07:08.328 --> 07:09.461
and then graduate?

07:09.463 --> 07:11.630
- You have to
register to graduate.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.632
- Okay, so when you register
every year as a student

07:13.634 --> 07:15.434
they don't, uh, the school
doesn't realize

07:15.436 --> 07:17.402
that you would like to
graduate when you finish?

07:17.404 --> 07:19.237
- You have to declare
your intention to graduate

07:19.239 --> 07:20.672
at convocation.

07:20.673 --> 07:22.106
- Does anyone go here with
the intention of not graduating?

07:22.276 --> 07:23.675
- You're still a graduate.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.343
You just aren't
going to graduate,

07:25.345 --> 07:26.978
if that makes sense.

07:27.448 --> 07:30.081
- It doesn't. Um, who do
I have to declare it to?

07:30.083 --> 07:31.349
- You go online
and declare.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.651
- That seems antiquated.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.453
- They've been doing it
since forever.

07:34.455 --> 07:36.455
- Oh, really, so the
five graduates of 1886

07:36.457 --> 07:38.490
went online to register
for convocation?

07:39.026 --> 07:41.226
- If you didn't know you had to
register for graduation,

07:41.228 --> 07:42.294
then you shouldn't
be graduating.

07:42.296 --> 07:43.662
You just won't get
your diploma at the ceremony

07:43.664 --> 07:44.896
because you won't be there.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.598
- Okay, well, it's not
a diploma, actually,

07:46.600 --> 07:49.267
it's a degree because we're
not graduating from high school.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.736
God, how should I break this
to my parents?

07:51.738 --> 07:52.971
- Well, they're
already disappointed

07:52.973 --> 07:54.539
you're not gonna be
a doctor or a lawyer,

07:54.541 --> 07:55.907
so the fact that you're not
graduating, like officially,

07:55.909 --> 07:57.509
as a journalist
probably won't matter.

07:57.511 --> 07:58.743
- I already bought them
graduation tickets.

07:58.745 --> 08:00.512
My mother has been
prepping by researching

08:00.514 --> 08:02.314
Jewish journalists.

08:02.316 --> 08:03.915
- You have to buy tickets?

08:03.917 --> 08:05.050
- Jason Bradley.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.451
(applause)

08:06.453 --> 08:08.687
(gentle score)

08:36.116 --> 08:37.549
(score fades out)

08:37.551 --> 08:39.017
(door opens)

08:39.019 --> 08:40.452
- DAVID: Bram?

08:40.454 --> 08:42.287
Come on back.

08:43.123 --> 08:43.855
- Hey.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.627
(loud industrial machinery)

09:11.718 --> 09:13.552
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.253
- Take a seat.

09:17.491 --> 09:19.558
Uh, so, you know
my sister-in-law?

09:20.127 --> 09:22.227
- Oh, well, I mean,
my mom's friends with Deb,

09:22.229 --> 09:23.929
so I don't, ah,

09:24.231 --> 09:25.931
know her, but...

09:26.333 --> 09:27.332
Yeah.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.301
- Okay. So other than

09:29.303 --> 09:31.303
sort-of-knowing Deb,
what should I know about you.

09:31.305 --> 09:33.972
- Uh, well, I went to
Western for undergrad and--

09:33.974 --> 09:37.576
- No, no. I got all that.
I read the resumé.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.678
You're a writer.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.114
Pitch me.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.053
- Yeah, um--

09:48.188 --> 09:49.487
(door opens)

09:49.489 --> 09:50.822
- JILL: Hello?

09:50.824 --> 09:52.724
- BRAM: What's for dinner?

09:53.427 --> 09:55.126
- So...?

09:57.631 --> 09:59.297
Aah!
- Hmm.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.332
- Awww.

10:00.334 --> 10:01.499
- PHIL: Good hug or bad hug?

10:01.501 --> 10:03.068
- Aww, are there bad hugs?

10:03.070 --> 10:03.969
- PHIL/BRAM: Yes.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.303
- Here, here, come here,
let me see.

10:05.305 --> 10:08.206
- I already signed it.
- Ah. I'm just reading it.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.240
Ah-ha.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.842
- Yeah, I read it.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.477
- You read they're not
paying your taxes?

10:12.479 --> 10:13.511
- Mm-hm.

10:13.513 --> 10:14.846
- No benefits either, Jill?

10:14.848 --> 10:16.081
- Okay, well, the only
benefit I considered

10:16.083 --> 10:17.749
when someone said "we'll
pay you money to work for us"

10:17.751 --> 10:19.618
is that in a couple of months
I can move out.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.653
- Do you know how much
a house is?

10:21.655 --> 10:23.321
- You know what, at this point,
I would've taken it

10:23.323 --> 10:24.556
if they offered me a Metropass.

10:24.558 --> 10:25.924
- They're not paying
for your Metropass?

10:25.926 --> 10:27.392
- I'm not buying a
house anytime soon.

10:27.394 --> 10:28.893
- Yeah, well, maybe slow down
on the four-dollar coffees.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.128
- Who's here?

10:30.129 --> 10:31.362
- How many days would I
have to give up coffee for

10:31.365 --> 10:32.430
in order to get into
the market?

10:32.432 --> 10:33.798
- SAMMI: Hi!
- PHIL: It's a down payment.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.933
- This is a surprise!

10:34.934 --> 10:36.067
- What was the downpayment
here 25 years ago?

10:36.069 --> 10:37.569
- Well, things were different.
You still have to save.

10:37.571 --> 10:38.570
- Bram got a job.

10:38.572 --> 10:39.738
- Like, a real one?

10:39.740 --> 10:42.807
- Yes, um, and I am
marrying a doctor

10:42.809 --> 10:45.410
and I'm going for lunch every
day before my afternoon nap.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.078
- Mmm, Mom set me
up with my job, too.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.681
- And if I give up my $4-a-day
coffee habit, then I can

10:49.683 --> 10:53.084
save up to buy a million dollar
tear-down in 684 years.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.887
- Wow, I'm sure
Wolf Blitzer has a house.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.389
- Yeah, that he bought
in the roaring 20s.

10:57.391 --> 10:59.090
- And Bernstein?
He's a journalist

10:59.092 --> 11:00.725
and he bought a house.

11:00.727 --> 11:02.661
- We are pregnant.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.663
- Oh, my God.
- What? Ahh!

11:04.665 --> 11:05.730
- Oh, Mazel Tov.

11:05.732 --> 11:07.265
(laughter) Such nachas...

11:07.267 --> 11:10.969
- Oh, I can't believe that my
baby's going to raise her baby!

11:10.971 --> 11:13.304
- I know. I can't believe it.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.407
- PHIL: I knew it, I knew it.

11:15.409 --> 11:16.708
- Nothing?

11:16.710 --> 11:18.510
- That's great. Mazel Tov!

11:18.512 --> 11:20.311
- Thank you, Uncle Bram.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.147
Thanks.

11:23.383 --> 11:24.716
- I feel fat.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.518
- I know, I felt
it when I hugged ya'.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.119
(Phil laughs)

11:28.121 --> 11:29.821
(rock score begins)

11:50.877 --> 11:52.444
- GIDDA: Stop the gravy train.

11:52.446 --> 11:53.445
(laughter)

11:53.447 --> 11:55.180
- You got it, Gidda.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.583
(knocks on door)

11:58.585 --> 12:00.852
(Gidda speaks Arabic)

12:08.261 --> 12:09.994
- Oh, uh...

12:15.535 --> 12:17.235
- Hi, Gidda!

12:18.238 --> 12:19.437
Tell her I say hi.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.506
- Hi, Hi. I understand. Hi.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.141
- Hi.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.210
- Ah, Gidda, Claire's
going to take you home.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.314
- The new girl's
waiting for you.

12:29.316 --> 12:30.815
- Right. Thanks.

12:30.817 --> 12:32.517
(percussive score begins)

12:39.226 --> 12:41.192
- He's already there. He
was supposed to get there later

12:41.194 --> 12:43.228
but he left early.
He does that sometimes.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.295
- ASHLEY: Okay.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.797
- Everyone's gonna be
taking pictures with him

12:45.799 --> 12:47.165
and posting them and saying
what they're gonna say

12:47.167 --> 12:48.733
but we have to make sure
it's organized around him.

12:48.735 --> 12:50.268
- Sure.
- He's easy.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.771
Everybody's got their own thing
with him but he's a good guy.

12:52.773 --> 12:54.572
- "Wieners come in all
shapes and sizes."

12:54.574 --> 12:56.141
You should lead with that.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.108
(laughter)

12:57.110 --> 12:59.043
- THE MOUSE: You the list guy?

12:59.045 --> 13:00.311
These go best
with what you got.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.313
- MANAGER: The list man.
She treating you okay?

13:02.315 --> 13:03.248
- BRAM: Yeah.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.950
- Make sure you say it,
best service.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.020
- Thanks, yeah.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.156
- I wanna write lists.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.825
- How about you go to the next
place and I'll go to the party?

13:13.827 --> 13:16.094
- Okay, here: "Hot dog race:
wiener takes all".

13:16.096 --> 13:17.328
- WAISGLASS: I thought
Jill told my mom

13:17.330 --> 13:18.696
that you started doing
city hall this week.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.165
- Classic Jill.
She also told my mom

13:20.167 --> 13:22.233
that Sammi's kid started walking
before any of his friends.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.902
- Well, now, according
to my mother, um,

13:23.904 --> 13:25.503
he tap-danced
out of the womb.

13:25.505 --> 13:26.938
She is the best publicist.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.273
No, I don't do city hall.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.974
- He's paid to be the
mayor's biggest fanboy.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.342
- A couple of months ago

13:31.344 --> 13:33.077
he decided he didn't want to
talk to press anymore.

13:33.079 --> 13:35.947
- So the press he likes
must really like him now.

13:35.949 --> 13:37.682
- This is what we
gotta work around.

13:37.684 --> 13:38.917
How do we have them
not asking questions

13:38.919 --> 13:40.118
without flat-out saying--

13:40.120 --> 13:42.053
- Doesn't he just flat-out
say most things?

13:42.055 --> 13:43.688
- Saying you can't ask
the mayor questions.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.790
- So there's this assault on the
papers that he doesn't like,

13:45.792 --> 13:46.724
ours included...

13:46.726 --> 13:48.092
- Saying you guys
are bad at your job?

13:48.094 --> 13:49.394
- He doesn't know
he's messing with

13:49.396 --> 13:50.495
a Frum Medal-winning graduate.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.096
- The news isn't accurate
unless he likes it.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.232
And the news that he does like
isn't always accurate.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.301
And then they
came up with this-

13:56.303 --> 13:57.635
this really ridiculous--

13:57.637 --> 13:59.437
- Genius idea.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.606
Don't give them Rob's
schedule every morning.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.108
- They have to chase you.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.710
- The papers are always behind

14:05.712 --> 14:07.178
because we don't know
what to cover each day.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.147
Well, except for the ones
that write the puff pieces,

14:09.149 --> 14:10.181
they know what's happening.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.516
- This is on your work, right?

14:11.518 --> 14:13.051
- Yeah, work perks, my friend.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.819
- So, the Frum Medal-winning,
top-of-his-class

14:14.821 --> 14:16.487
journalism major that
you are currently splitting

14:16.489 --> 14:19.424
a knackwurst with was just
promoted from list-writer.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.459
- 14 bucks for a hot dog?
We should get jobs here.

14:21.461 --> 14:22.393
- So, what are you now?

14:22.395 --> 14:23.461
- Oh, I'm I'm still list writer.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.129
But I'm also the guy
that reverse-engineers

14:25.131 --> 14:27.432
Rob Ford's schedule by
checking his Instagram,

14:27.434 --> 14:29.267
Facebook and Twitter accounts
for his daily whereabouts

14:29.269 --> 14:31.469
and I deliver those reports
to my boss every morning

14:31.471 --> 14:33.638
so that he can give those
stories to everyone but me

14:33.640 --> 14:35.173
as I go off to rate
some hot dogs.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.775
- Okay, but what happens
when some frat bro

14:37.777 --> 14:40.478
posts a picture of
him taking a funnel?

14:40.480 --> 14:42.113
- We bury it. Rob does.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.182
You blacklist a paper and
that becomes their story.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.050
"Assault on us!
Free speech!"

14:46.052 --> 14:48.753
But their free speech becomes
speechifying about their own

14:48.755 --> 14:50.788
personal losses,
not the people's.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.323
So the people don't care.

14:52.325 --> 14:53.925
- I'm basically playing
"Where's Waldo"

14:53.927 --> 14:55.326
with a very large Waldo

14:55.328 --> 14:58.162
until I see something that
I can force my way into.

14:58.164 --> 15:00.131
- Okay, we better
get our buns moving.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.066
- But you also
still do the lists?

15:02.068 --> 15:03.534
- Did you enjoy
your free meal?

15:03.536 --> 15:05.837
- The people must know the
ten best sausages in the city.

15:05.839 --> 15:07.305
Give this place top prize.

15:07.307 --> 15:08.806
- Yeah, bonus points
for their ad spend.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.341
- Whatever happened
to church and state?

15:10.343 --> 15:11.843
- Total clicks.

15:11.845 --> 15:13.044
- You can't come?

15:13.046 --> 15:14.345
- Hot dog tour awaits.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.280
- Ketchup later.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.282
- Yeah, I relish
the opportunity.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.490
Thank you.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.693
(loud club music)

15:29.996 --> 15:32.230
- When are you
supposed to stop him?

15:32.232 --> 15:33.097
- I'm not.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.465
- You're not going to
stop him?

15:34.467 --> 15:35.700
- I'm not supposed to.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.201
- Isn't that your job?

15:37.203 --> 15:38.736
- Not in my job description.

15:38.738 --> 15:39.771
- Actually, it's
part of yours.

15:39.773 --> 15:40.705
- My what?

15:40.707 --> 15:41.839
- Job description.

15:41.841 --> 15:42.807
- To cut him off?

15:42.809 --> 15:44.008
- To make sure no one knows

15:44.010 --> 15:45.910
people thought he
needed to be cut off.

15:45.912 --> 15:47.211
- We should've had
people sign an NDA

15:47.213 --> 15:48.613
when they bought tickets.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.582
- Or confiscated their phones.
Don't look at Instagram.

15:51.584 --> 15:52.951
- Can you imagine the uproar?

15:52.953 --> 15:54.919
- I don't think anybody
cares about signing an NDA.

15:54.921 --> 15:56.454
- No, no, I mean if we'd
taken their phones.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.756
- So what do you do if he does
something embarrassing?

15:58.758 --> 15:59.991
- Do you wanna
take this one?

15:59.993 --> 16:02.994
- Nah. Let her see
the master at work.

16:04.331 --> 16:05.830
- Ask me again.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.734
- What do you do if he does
something embarrassing?

16:10.070 --> 16:13.838
- The media is always
out to embarrass our mayor.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.240
Note the use of "our"
instead of "the" mayor

16:16.242 --> 16:18.476
even while he's
fighting -- key word

16:18.478 --> 16:19.877
he's up against the enemy,

16:19.879 --> 16:21.512
sword and shield,
taking down the dragons.

16:21.514 --> 16:24.282
To help the working taxpayers
of this great city,

16:24.284 --> 16:27.852
see their money working for them
instead of lining the pockets

16:27.854 --> 16:29.454
of special interest cronies.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.990
That tells them that there's
this cabal of rich dudes

16:31.992 --> 16:33.891
pulling the strings
for the other guys.

16:33.893 --> 16:36.194
Now, do you know what's
truly embarrassing?

16:36.196 --> 16:38.062
No, Anderson,
don't cut me off.

16:38.064 --> 16:39.897
I'm not finished.
Here's where we put the person

16:39.899 --> 16:42.033
asking the question on defense.

16:42.035 --> 16:45.370
That you're focusing
on whether our mayor --

16:45.372 --> 16:46.471
check --

16:46.473 --> 16:48.206
grabbed a beer with
his friends last night --

16:48.208 --> 16:49.474
the everyman, check --

16:49.476 --> 16:52.043
while the mayor's opponents --
the dragons --

16:52.045 --> 16:55.013
are, at this very moment
proposing spending increases

16:55.015 --> 16:57.715
in support of themselves
and their donors --

16:57.717 --> 16:59.984
secret cabal, check-check --

16:59.986 --> 17:03.254
at the expense
of the taxpayer.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.789
(laughing)

17:04.991 --> 17:06.991
- They don't call us
special assistants for nothing.

17:06.993 --> 17:08.893
(glasses clink)

17:08.895 --> 17:10.595
(church bell tolls)

17:14.034 --> 17:15.733
(cell phone vibrates)

17:16.036 --> 17:17.435
(cell phone vibrates)

17:17.437 --> 17:19.370
(cell phone chimes
and vibrates)

17:19.372 --> 17:20.772
(sighing)

17:20.774 --> 17:22.673
(score begins)

17:23.543 --> 17:25.777
- PHIL: Whatever it is, push to
write about it. Be aggressive.

17:25.779 --> 17:26.844
- I know.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.279
- You won the Frum Medal!

17:28.281 --> 17:29.547
Tell them.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.249
- They know. Bye.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.992
- Dave, hey. I was just
coming to find you.

17:40.994 --> 17:42.060
- Well, you found me.
What's up?

17:42.062 --> 17:43.728
- Oh, I wanted to talk
to you about this story.

17:43.730 --> 17:44.896
- Talk.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.364
- It's this story
I want to show you.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.733
- So show me. Talk or
show, Bram. Talk or show.

17:48.735 --> 17:49.901
- Okay.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.102
- Hey, you hear about
the CJPAC party?

17:51.104 --> 17:52.470
- Yeah, I spoke to Nelson.
They're denying.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.505
I'll speak with her and
anyone else who was there

17:54.507 --> 17:56.507
who's gonna talk
but it was open bar.

17:56.509 --> 17:57.508
- Speak with who?

17:57.510 --> 17:59.210
- So what, what does that mean?
Who cares.

17:59.212 --> 18:02.547
- It's a bunch of dumb kids,
politicians and unlimited booze,

18:02.549 --> 18:04.182
we're not going to get
anything reliable.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.516
Not on record, anyway.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.018
- Try.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.052
- Wait, what is that story?

18:08.054 --> 18:09.554
- Susan's on it.
What did you wanna show me?

18:09.556 --> 18:11.389
- I could do it with her.
What's, what's it?

18:11.391 --> 18:12.807
- Ooh!

18:12.808 --> 18:14.224
As much as she'd love that,
we have you on something else.

18:14.227 --> 18:18.129
Uhh, where is it?
Best brunch spots in the city.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.865
- Yeah. Um, I mean...

18:21.868 --> 18:23.534
Dave, just, the thing is, just

18:23.536 --> 18:24.969
I've been working for
more than a year now--

18:24.971 --> 18:26.337
- I know.

18:26.339 --> 18:28.439
- You know? And I just was,
I was wondering if...

18:28.441 --> 18:30.308
I'm still doing the same thing.
Which is, that's--

18:30.310 --> 18:32.310
I don't mind doing that...
I like that stuff,

18:32.312 --> 18:34.946
I just, I think
that I could be...

18:34.948 --> 18:37.748
really useful with
this sort of thing, too.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.785
- You're a reporter.
You report on things.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.286
- Lists.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.088
- You know you don't get
to be editor on day two

18:44.090 --> 18:45.590
just 'cuz you showed up
on day one.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.058
- I-I know.

18:47.060 --> 18:48.126
- Do you?

18:48.128 --> 18:49.994
People read lists.
They read them.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.029
You remember when the Huffington
Post used to have real news?

18:52.031 --> 18:53.998
- BuzzFeed does real news now
so can I just, can I just--

18:54.000 --> 18:55.766
- No one who actually
cares about the news

18:55.768 --> 18:57.335
looks for it on the
sidebar of

18:57.337 --> 19:00.438
"The 15 Paperweights That'll
Restore Your Faith in Beyonce."

19:00.440 --> 19:03.975
- Well, I'll-I'll still
do the brunch thing, I just...

19:04.144 --> 19:05.843
That's...

19:06.946 --> 19:08.813
I mean, I won the Frum Medal.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.448
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.286
Go do some streeters!

19:15.288 --> 19:17.188
About the CJPAC thing.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.325
(score begins)

19:21.327 --> 19:22.827
- So, last night,
Rob Ford was at an event

19:22.829 --> 19:25.596
where he was accused of groping
a former mayoral candidate.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.398
How do you feel like this
reflects on the city?

19:27.400 --> 19:29.066
- BLACK TOQUE MAN: He likes
to have a good time.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.468
I like to have a good time.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.069
- FUR WOMAN: Well. It's gross.

19:32.071 --> 19:33.471
- YELLOW COAT WOMAN: You guys,

19:33.473 --> 19:35.306
it's just non-stop
with this guy.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.741
Just let him do his job.

19:36.742 --> 19:38.175
- Excuse me, sir, can I ask you
just a quick question about--

19:38.178 --> 19:39.877
- MOHAWK MAN: Don't give a fuck.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.362
- Thank you.

19:41.363 --> 19:42.846
Can I ask you a quick question
about the Mayor real quick?

19:42.849 --> 19:43.881
- ORANGE TOQUE GUY: High school.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.283
- That's right.
- Bram.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.285
- How are you, man?
- Good.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.419
Is this what
you're doing now?

19:48.421 --> 19:49.854
- Like, really, who cares?

19:49.856 --> 19:51.389
- I mean, groping or not,

19:51.391 --> 19:53.591
it's believeable and it's gross
and that's what's wrong with it.

19:53.593 --> 19:56.694
- Do you get paid for this
or is it, like, volunteer?

19:56.696 --> 19:57.895
- Who cares?

19:57.897 --> 20:00.164
- I don't remember the
question but I have to go.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.432
- Word. Okay.
- See you later.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.868
- Say "Hi" to your mom.
- Yep.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.504
(score ends)

20:08.241 --> 20:11.108
- Excuse-- Excuse me, sir?
Could you just-- Could you--

20:11.110 --> 20:13.911
Do you want to answer
a quick question?

20:17.717 --> 20:19.116
Okay.

20:19.118 --> 20:20.818
(flags flapping in wind)

20:27.994 --> 20:29.527
- Seeing as how
a mere three days later,

20:29.529 --> 20:32.230
there's not a front page
mention of Gropegate--

20:32.232 --> 20:33.497
- I don't think it's
considered a "-gate"

20:33.499 --> 20:34.899
if it's not even mentioned
three days later.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.033
- Claire?

20:36.035 --> 20:37.301
- Yeah. I don't think
it's a "-gate."

20:37.303 --> 20:38.970
- Overruled!
- Man, let's get this going!

20:38.972 --> 20:40.605
Tonight is a special night

20:40.607 --> 20:43.040
because for the first time in
her young career as an aborted

20:43.042 --> 20:45.009
lawyer-cum-communications
manager

20:45.011 --> 20:48.012
I pass tonight's
City Hall of Fame to...

20:48.014 --> 20:49.480
(drumming)

20:49.482 --> 20:50.915
Ashley!

20:50.917 --> 20:52.116
(cheers)

20:52.118 --> 20:53.484
- For answering that phone
like no other.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.886
- Uh, how many calls redirected
over a two-day period?

20:55.888 --> 20:58.823
- 250-fucking-four.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.224
- Ashley!

21:00.226 --> 21:01.926
(drumming)

21:02.328 --> 21:05.363
Four years of undergrad in --
psychology?

21:05.798 --> 21:07.064
- Classics.
- Ah.

21:07.066 --> 21:09.567
Very practical. Four years
in whatever-the-fuck that is.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.369
Another three floating
smack in the middle

21:11.371 --> 21:12.737
of your law-school class,

21:12.739 --> 21:14.405
seeing your entire Facebook
doing better than you

21:14.407 --> 21:16.240
at everything and you too

21:16.242 --> 21:18.576
can have a job that most
forward-thinking companies

21:18.578 --> 21:20.978
have replaced with a machine!

21:20.980 --> 21:22.813
Ashley Pollock, everybody!

21:22.815 --> 21:25.750
- Thank you. All right, yes!

21:25.752 --> 21:27.118
Thank you so much.

21:27.120 --> 21:30.221
Thank you, thank you,
thank you. Yes.

21:30.223 --> 21:31.322
- Congratulations.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.024
- Thank you.

21:33.526 --> 21:36.594
Wow, I wasn't expecting this.

21:36.596 --> 21:37.995
I am so humbled.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.831
Truth is, I can't take
all the credit on this one.

21:40.833 --> 21:44.068
Mostly, I have to thank
a shitload of debt.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.536
Linda, who calls twice a week

21:45.538 --> 21:47.805
and who's not only
my loan officer

21:47.807 --> 21:50.241
but who's also, basically,
my therapist

21:50.243 --> 21:51.842
and personal advisor.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.711
Oh, no the music!

21:53.713 --> 21:56.047
I have to thank
that piece of paper

21:56.049 --> 21:58.182
that's hanging
in my parent's den.

21:58.184 --> 22:00.117
- To Ashley!
(cheers)

22:00.119 --> 22:02.019
(score begins)

22:11.230 --> 22:12.930
(phone ringing)

22:15.601 --> 22:17.101
- Sharma.

22:24.577 --> 22:27.578
- LOWEY: A year ago,
someone recorded a video,

22:29.649 --> 22:31.349
allegedly...

22:32.118 --> 22:33.417
- Of what?

22:33.419 --> 22:35.486
She started working there
a few months ago.

22:35.488 --> 22:36.921
- Why would she know anything?

22:36.923 --> 22:38.556
- Press calls her before
releasing anything.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.024
She's the gatekeeper.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.826
- So the guy selling
the video would call her?

22:41.828 --> 22:44.462
- No. He'd call Kamal but she
may know if the video guy

22:44.464 --> 22:45.963
contacted him first.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.398
- What does Kamal do?

22:47.400 --> 22:49.166
- Special Assistant
to the Mayor.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.334
- And he knows?

22:50.336 --> 22:52.036
- Everything.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.172
(toilet flushing)

22:55.174 --> 22:56.807
- Now, sorry, what's the
difference between

22:56.809 --> 22:59.377
special assistants
and assistants?

22:59.379 --> 23:00.711
- No, they're all special.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.246
- Your mom tell you that, too?

23:02.248 --> 23:04.148
Look, call the girl and tell her

23:04.150 --> 23:06.584
we won't release her name if
that's what she's worried about.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.119
- Oh, Judith Asche
from the paper?

23:08.121 --> 23:09.520
She wants us to come down there.

23:09.522 --> 23:11.622
- Oh yeah, I told her.
It's an internal issue for them.

23:11.624 --> 23:14.191
- It sounds like one of her
guys may have met with our guy.

23:14.193 --> 23:15.893
- Can we call our guy
"the video guy"

23:15.895 --> 23:18.529
so we can keep this all clear?
Who's their guy?

23:18.531 --> 23:19.764
- Which guy are
you talking about?

23:19.766 --> 23:21.899
- The paper's guy.
- Oh, the list guy.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.300
- Yeah. The list guy.

23:23.302 --> 23:24.935
(door locking)

23:24.937 --> 23:26.637
- Fuck.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.573
(tense score begins)

24:06.012 --> 24:09.346
- LOWEY: So you tended to work
on what kind of assignments?

24:09.348 --> 24:11.115
- What nobody else wanted.

24:13.252 --> 24:14.785
Uh,

24:14.787 --> 24:17.688
top ten lists. Best burgers,
best fruit stands.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.857
- But you also knew
everywhere he was gonna be?

24:19.859 --> 24:23.027
- Everywhere he had been.
Or as he was there, maybe.

24:23.029 --> 24:24.962
But never before.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.264
- So how does this video come
your way if you're the guy

24:27.266 --> 24:29.066
making lists of good burgers?

24:30.470 --> 24:32.169
- Downsizing.

24:33.873 --> 24:35.439
- SUSAN: Did you
get one of these?

24:39.045 --> 24:41.178
- No, I-I don't think...

24:41.180 --> 24:43.180
No.

24:59.599 --> 25:01.499
- Susan speaking...

25:01.868 --> 25:03.567
David. Hi.

25:07.006 --> 25:10.708
Listen, David. David.
David, I am not

25:10.710 --> 25:13.344
sitting through a meeting
to go through this.

25:13.346 --> 25:15.045
I'm just not.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.314
This is...

25:17.316 --> 25:18.816
Hm.

25:18.818 --> 25:20.284
Where's Judith?

25:20.286 --> 25:22.620
Because I want to
speak with her.

25:22.755 --> 25:26.023
Ah, no, she wouldn't,
would she? Heaven forbid.

25:29.061 --> 25:32.129
David, I am not coming in
there to put myself through this

25:32.131 --> 25:34.565
to walk out with
a fucking folder

25:34.567 --> 25:37.201
so everybody here
can see, okay?

25:37.203 --> 25:38.903
I'm not.

25:39.605 --> 25:42.806
All right, well, then,
just put whatever it is

25:42.808 --> 25:44.909
in your little folder
in the mail for me, David.

25:44.911 --> 25:47.745
Yes, in the mail,
and I will look it over

25:47.747 --> 25:50.014
with a drink in my hand.

25:52.018 --> 25:53.684
- So...

25:54.754 --> 25:57.021
the guy didn't have a choice?

25:57.390 --> 25:59.657
- Well, I didn't really care.

26:00.426 --> 26:02.359
I got the call.

26:02.361 --> 26:03.994
(phone ringing)

26:03.996 --> 26:05.930
(dramatic score)

26:05.932 --> 26:07.631
(phone ringing)

26:10.202 --> 26:11.902
(phone ringing)

26:14.507 --> 26:16.140
(phone ringing)

26:17.810 --> 26:19.310
- Hello?

26:20.212 --> 26:22.279
Oh, no. Um...

26:23.449 --> 26:25.249
But I can help you.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.320
Bram.

26:32.124 --> 26:33.824
Yeah.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.793
No-no-no-yes, I can meet.

26:36.996 --> 26:38.596
- I just think if they
let this woman go,

26:38.598 --> 26:39.830
you should ask for
a raise. Something.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.065
- Okay, well, they fired her

26:41.067 --> 26:42.266
because they don't want
to pay her anymore.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.934
So I really don't think
they're just going to roll over

26:43.936 --> 26:45.035
whatever savings they've got
on to me.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.570
I don't, I don't want to
discuss it.

26:46.572 --> 26:48.305
- Okay. Okay. We don't
have to discuss it,

26:48.307 --> 26:49.440
but

26:49.442 --> 26:51.442
I just want to say that

26:51.444 --> 26:53.711
I think you're settling.
That's it.

26:55.247 --> 26:55.980
- Okay.

26:57.550 --> 26:58.282
- Okay.

27:00.886 --> 27:02.686
So, that's all you have
to say is okay?

27:02.688 --> 27:03.887
- I thought that we
weren't discussing it.

27:03.889 --> 27:05.589
- We not discussing it.
I'm just...

27:05.591 --> 27:08.292
- We're just gonna keep
the discussion going.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.693
- I'm not the kind of mother

27:09.695 --> 27:11.895
that pressured her son to go to
law school, Bram, okay?

27:11.897 --> 27:13.397
- No, no. You're the kind
that guilts me for

27:13.399 --> 27:14.531
not having thought of it myself.

27:14.533 --> 27:16.266
- And you're still
doing the lists.

27:16.268 --> 27:17.635
- SERVER: Pea soups?

27:17.637 --> 27:20.537
Okay. And the Greek.

27:20.539 --> 27:22.439
Tuna Reuben for the boy's
coming up.

27:22.441 --> 27:24.908
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

27:26.012 --> 27:27.311
I'm just--

27:27.313 --> 27:28.612
(sighs)

27:28.614 --> 27:30.347
You write so well.

27:30.349 --> 27:32.049
You're so smart

27:32.051 --> 27:35.719
and now you're just writing
the-the 20 best things to...

27:35.721 --> 27:39.423
I don't know! The places to make
a candle -- whatever! Oh.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.191
- Well, hm, I got
a story, anyways.

27:41.193 --> 27:42.092
Um,

27:42.094 --> 27:44.595
a guy called and
he wants to meet.

27:44.597 --> 27:46.296
- Oh. About what?

27:46.832 --> 27:48.065
- I guess we'll find out.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.900
- Oh, my God. Where does
he want to meet you?

27:49.902 --> 27:51.735
Actually, don't even tell me.

27:51.737 --> 27:54.271
Just text me afterwards, okay?

27:54.273 --> 27:55.806
Ah.

27:55.808 --> 27:57.608
- Look, you tell your story in
your own words, people listen.

27:57.610 --> 27:59.309
Don't filter. And tell
this David guy,

27:59.311 --> 28:01.712
"I'm pitching it.
It's my story. Don't ask."

28:01.714 --> 28:03.213
- Tuna reuben.
- Thank you.

28:03.215 --> 28:04.915
- Plate's hot.

28:21.067 --> 28:22.766
- Abe.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.635
Hi.

28:24.637 --> 28:26.336
Bram.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.505
- You don't mind?

28:28.674 --> 28:31.041
- No. No no, no. I sh...

28:31.343 --> 28:33.043
Should've brought mine.

28:35.081 --> 28:36.580
So, um,

28:36.582 --> 28:38.549
you called, but,

28:38.684 --> 28:40.984
said you wanted to meet in
person about your story?

28:40.986 --> 28:43.087
- I work in the community.

28:43.089 --> 28:46.557
Normally we are not getting paid
that much attention to.

28:46.559 --> 28:49.293
- Well, I'm happy
to speak with you.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.829
- I saw the lists you write.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.098
I like those.

28:55.034 --> 28:57.134
- Oh. Thanks.

28:57.136 --> 29:00.404
- But, one time, you asked
what people thought

29:01.140 --> 29:04.274
about how the mayor acted
at that thing, yeah?

29:04.276 --> 29:06.844
You know someone said he was

29:06.846 --> 29:09.346
maybe drunk and I wondered...

29:09.348 --> 29:11.148
I was surprised why

29:11.150 --> 29:14.318
no one asked if maybe
it was something else

29:14.320 --> 29:16.920
that made Mr. Ford act that way.

29:17.389 --> 29:19.957
- Well uh, what do you mean
"something else"?

29:19.959 --> 29:22.960
- You're probably thinking,
maybe, what I do.

29:23.562 --> 29:25.162
- Well, I'm actually thinking,

29:25.464 --> 29:28.899
"What do you mean by 'something
else' made him act that way?"

29:28.901 --> 29:30.801
(dryer cycle finished buzzer)

29:34.406 --> 29:35.806
(dramatic score begins)

29:35.808 --> 29:37.841
- Some of these kids I know
don't lead their lives

29:37.843 --> 29:39.543
in the right way.

29:41.747 --> 29:43.447
"Something else."

29:44.049 --> 29:46.250
- I gotta be honest, I have

29:46.252 --> 29:48.886
no clue what you're talking
about or what the story is,

29:48.888 --> 29:51.054
which sort of helps tell it.

29:51.056 --> 29:52.456
(Abe laughs)

29:52.458 --> 29:54.158
(laughter)

30:03.135 --> 30:05.302
- I told them I would help them,

30:05.304 --> 30:08.372
so they don't have to
do this bad stuff.

30:08.541 --> 30:11.542
- I feel like this meeting
needs a Rashi, or something.

30:11.544 --> 30:13.243
- A what?

30:13.813 --> 30:15.546
- Never mind.

30:15.548 --> 30:17.481
(paper unfolding)

30:22.555 --> 30:24.621
What am I looking at?

30:24.957 --> 30:27.324
- For a good story, maybe...

30:27.326 --> 30:29.426
your paper, they pay?

30:34.767 --> 30:36.934
- So, we can't tack anything
on this guy

30:36.936 --> 30:39.236
other than taking a picture
with low-level bangers?

30:39.238 --> 30:40.370
- No, not yet.

30:40.372 --> 30:41.705
- So, who drove him here?

30:41.707 --> 30:42.773
- It could've been his guy.

30:42.775 --> 30:44.374
- Which guy's that?
- Rob's guy.

30:44.376 --> 30:47.110
- Okay, so Rob's guy takes Rob
to visit these guys,

30:47.112 --> 30:49.046
who're using the video
- Alleged.

30:49.048 --> 30:52.783
- Alleged video, thank you,
to sell to the list guy?

30:52.785 --> 30:54.284
- And others, yeah.

30:54.286 --> 30:56.353
- Well, how many
private residences

30:56.355 --> 30:57.855
did this guy drive Rob to?

30:57.857 --> 30:59.456
- Which guy?
- Rob's guy.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.658
- Thousands.
- Thousands?

31:01.660 --> 31:02.860
- Yeah. People
call him everyday.

31:02.862 --> 31:04.895
- And he answered them?
Personally?

31:04.897 --> 31:07.464
- In person.
(phone rings)

31:07.466 --> 31:08.999
(phone rings)

31:09.001 --> 31:10.968
<i> - You've reached the office</i>
<i> of Mayor Rob Ford.</i>

31:10.970 --> 31:13.170
<i> Neither he, nor Special</i>
<i> Assistant, Kamal Arafa</i>

31:13.172 --> 31:14.705
<i> are able to take your call.</i>

31:14.707 --> 31:16.106
<i> If this is a query</i>
<i> for the Mayor,</i>

31:16.108 --> 31:17.741
<i> please leave your name and</i>

31:17.743 --> 31:19.610
<i> return your call</i>
<i> within 48 hours.</i>

31:19.612 --> 31:21.578
<i> Go Argos!</i>

31:21.580 --> 31:23.280
(answering machine
recording beep)

31:33.726 --> 31:34.491
- I have something.

31:34.493 --> 31:35.225
- What is it?

31:38.731 --> 31:40.530
- Can I pitch it?
- You are. What is it?

31:40.532 --> 31:42.199
- No, I want to do it
at the desk meeting.

31:42.201 --> 31:43.267
- Huh, no.

31:45.504 --> 31:46.970
- Dave, it's a good story.

31:46.972 --> 31:48.772
- Everyone's story's always
a good story until it's not

31:48.774 --> 31:50.173
and it ends up being bad
when Judith sucks

31:50.175 --> 31:51.592
the air out if it.

31:51.593 --> 31:53.010
- Last time I gave you a
story you gave it to Susan.

31:53.012 --> 31:54.945
- Last time you gave me
a story, I didn't pitch it.

32:09.995 --> 32:11.929
I'm gonna need some context.

32:11.931 --> 32:15.699
- Well, if you like it,
I'm pitching it. It's my story.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.337
(knocking on door)

32:23.375 --> 32:26.009
- Oh! Hey! How are ya?

32:26.011 --> 32:28.812
Hey. How are ya? How ya doing?
What's your name?

32:28.814 --> 32:29.780
- Lauren.

32:29.782 --> 32:32.149
- Huh, Lauren?

32:32.151 --> 32:34.718
A selfie, or... Very good.

32:34.720 --> 32:35.819
- Thank you.

32:35.821 --> 32:38.055
- All right. All right.
You take care.

32:46.532 --> 32:47.264
They home?

32:48.434 --> 32:49.166
- I knocked.

32:49.902 --> 32:50.634
- Here.

33:01.847 --> 33:03.280
Hi, I'm Rob.

33:03.282 --> 33:05.482
You left me a message
on my answering machine.

33:05.484 --> 33:10.120
<i>- Hey, Mayor Ford, uh, my name's</i>
<i>Mark. I live around midtown and</i>

33:10.122 --> 33:12.622
(overlapping indecipherable
voice messages)

33:28.207 --> 33:31.308
- Kamal's got your information.
I'll follow up in a week.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.176
- Uh, we'll try for a week.

33:33.178 --> 33:35.779
It's closer to three weeks,
maybe a month.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.849
- Okay. A month.

33:38.851 --> 33:41.151
- Thanks for the call.
And the support.

33:41.153 --> 33:43.687
<i> - No problem.</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I, uh...

33:44.523 --> 33:45.255
I appreciate it.

33:51.964 --> 33:53.997
- I don't want you to do that.

33:53.999 --> 33:55.599
When you disagree with me,

33:55.601 --> 33:57.968
you work for me, so you don't
disagree with me.

33:57.970 --> 33:59.269
- I didn't.

33:59.271 --> 34:01.238
- You told them it would be
a month before we got back

34:01.240 --> 34:02.639
to them.

34:02.641 --> 34:04.708
- It is. I told you,
we're backed up on these.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.109
- You didn't remind me!

34:06.111 --> 34:07.511
It's too long!

34:07.513 --> 34:09.980
Look, they voted for me
to fix stuff and you're not!

34:09.982 --> 34:11.615
- Remember, I told you--

34:11.617 --> 34:13.550
- But you didn't tell me.

34:17.589 --> 34:18.855
- We're late.

34:18.857 --> 34:22.592
- Hey, don't get your panties
in a knot. Start the car.

34:36.075 --> 34:37.774
(clearing throat)

34:40.646 --> 34:41.745
- JUDITH: David.

34:41.747 --> 34:43.146
- Mm-hm?

34:43.148 --> 34:45.348
- Why are you two people?

34:45.350 --> 34:46.850
(sighing)

34:47.386 --> 34:48.652
- It's, uh...

34:48.654 --> 34:50.353
His story.

34:51.790 --> 34:53.490
- Okay.

34:55.160 --> 34:57.994
You see how these meetings
work, David, is--

34:58.530 --> 35:00.597
I think you know this because
you're in these meetings

35:00.599 --> 35:02.999
twice a day, every day --
is the desk editor

35:03.001 --> 35:05.602
gathers some options
from their beat to pitch.

35:05.938 --> 35:08.705
Everyone has
someone else's story.

35:08.707 --> 35:11.341
So you brought the kid
with you today, fine, but...

35:11.343 --> 35:13.543
But this tells me one
of two things. Either...

35:13.545 --> 35:14.845
one:

35:14.847 --> 35:16.379
you think this is a big story,

35:16.381 --> 35:19.549
big enough to bring someone in
to corroborate or back you up.

35:19.551 --> 35:21.585
Probably back you up,
I'm thinking.

35:21.587 --> 35:24.855
Or two: the kid's jerking
you off under the table.

35:25.357 --> 35:27.124
(chuckles)

35:28.026 --> 35:29.759
Neither's really
a great option.

35:29.761 --> 35:32.529
In the first case,
your most junior reporter,

35:32.531 --> 35:34.331
who's been here a tenth
of the time than your

35:34.333 --> 35:37.667
next most senior reporter
has been, is scooping people

35:37.669 --> 35:40.170
that we are paying at least
three times more,

35:40.172 --> 35:42.606
and that tells me that
there is still

35:42.608 --> 35:44.341
some fat to be
trimmed at your desk

35:44.343 --> 35:47.844
and you know they are always
looking to trim some fat.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.947
I don't like letting
people go, though,

35:50.949 --> 35:52.883
so, I don't like that option.

35:53.585 --> 35:56.853
But in the second scenario?
The one

35:56.855 --> 36:00.524
where he is jerking you
off at the office, well...

36:00.526 --> 36:03.059
you are being jerked off
and I don't think we pay you

36:03.061 --> 36:04.794
for that, either.

36:04.796 --> 36:06.296
(laughing)

36:06.665 --> 36:08.765
I don't think
you're being jerked off.

36:08.767 --> 36:09.733
- I'm not.

36:09.735 --> 36:11.434
- That's too bad.

36:11.803 --> 36:13.336
(sighing)

36:13.338 --> 36:16.239
But, I don't want to embarrass
the kid by asking him to leave

36:16.241 --> 36:18.942
his first desk meeting,
but it is one rep per desk,

36:18.944 --> 36:21.778
so we'll see you
at the next one, David.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.683
It's his story.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.386
(laughing)

36:32.524 --> 36:34.224
- Fine.

36:42.568 --> 36:44.234
- Wait.

36:45.804 --> 36:47.504
Lynn?

36:47.940 --> 36:49.472
- LYNN: Mirvish is filing suit

36:49.474 --> 36:51.208
against a New York gallery

36:51.210 --> 36:53.777
for purchasing fake Pollocks
ten years ago.

36:53.779 --> 36:55.912
(loud machinery)

37:10.429 --> 37:13.330
- I don't like too many
people in the room.

37:13.332 --> 37:16.233
Everyone'll want to come in
to pitch their story.

37:16.235 --> 37:18.568
There's just not enough time
as it is and

37:18.570 --> 37:21.871
not everyone's story is as
good as they think it is.

37:21.873 --> 37:23.573
As big.

37:26.745 --> 37:27.677
(sighs)

37:27.679 --> 37:29.379
How good is yours?

37:30.849 --> 37:33.583
- Well, now I feel like maybe
it's not as good as I think.

37:33.819 --> 37:35.518
- Don't sandbag. It's obnoxious.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.224
- Yeah, right.

37:41.226 --> 37:42.859
Um, okay. Uh...

37:44.096 --> 37:46.196
- Why are their
eyes blacked out?

37:46.198 --> 37:47.931
- Um, he doesn't want us
to print it

37:47.933 --> 37:49.299
unless we're taking the story.

37:49.301 --> 37:51.101
- We're not taking the story
unless we can see the video.

37:51.103 --> 37:54.638
Otherwise it's-it's just a photo
of him with a bunch of kids.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.506
He takes pictures with
everyone, everywhere.

37:56.508 --> 37:59.943
He's the town's mall Santa,
all year.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.344
How much does
your guy want?

38:01.346 --> 38:04.247
- Uh, he said that someone else
offered them 5,000

38:04.249 --> 38:05.749
and they want more.

38:05.751 --> 38:06.683
- Who?

38:06.685 --> 38:08.385
- He didn't say.

38:08.887 --> 38:10.820
- You think it's real?

38:12.758 --> 38:13.957
- I don't know.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.492
- Here's a new rule: when you're
asked your opinion,

38:15.494 --> 38:16.860
you have to have one.

38:16.862 --> 38:19.729
When you met with your guy--
do you know his name?

38:19.731 --> 38:21.231
- His first name.

38:21.233 --> 38:24.367
- Okay. When you met with him

38:24.369 --> 38:26.936
did you believe that
he was being truthful?

38:28.006 --> 38:29.606
- Yes.

38:32.044 --> 38:33.543
- We're interested,
but not sold.

38:33.545 --> 38:35.245
Tell him. Try and see the video.

38:35.247 --> 38:37.314
- Well, unless we have an offer,
I don't-I don't--

38:37.316 --> 38:39.015
think that will happen.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.953
- Then you don't have a story.

38:43.955 --> 38:45.722
(gentle score begins)

38:56.068 --> 38:57.767
- Rob's not here.

39:01.573 --> 39:03.340
- He left something at Hadi's.

39:03.342 --> 39:05.342
I was just
bringing it back.

39:06.144 --> 39:07.377
- You can leave it with me.

39:11.016 --> 39:14.484
- I was also thinking
maybe I could speak with him?

39:14.720 --> 39:16.419
Maybe.

39:17.556 --> 39:19.689
- You can talk to me.

39:53.125 --> 39:55.759
- Hi! Hey, it's Bram. Um...

39:56.561 --> 39:59.496
Let's, uh, let's meet again,
all right? I can, um...

39:59.498 --> 40:02.799
Just-just try me back or
I'll-I'll-I'll call you again,

40:02.801 --> 40:04.968
I guess, um...

40:04.970 --> 40:06.369
It's Bram, again, it's--

40:06.371 --> 40:08.238
We met at the laundromat.

40:08.240 --> 40:09.939
Um...

40:10.242 --> 40:12.842
Uh, thanks. Okay. Uh, bye.

40:16.014 --> 40:17.414
(notebook down on table)

40:17.416 --> 40:19.115
(sighing)

40:20.752 --> 40:21.818
- Hut!

40:21.820 --> 40:23.386
- Let's go! Let's hustle up.
Let's go.

40:23.388 --> 40:24.888
- Let's go! Let's go, go, go!

40:24.890 --> 40:25.955
- Get it back in!

40:25.957 --> 40:27.357
- PAULA: Rob, can we
just ask some questions?

40:27.359 --> 40:29.392
- KAMAL: Not right now,
Paula. We're busy.

40:29.394 --> 40:30.760
- You guys are
always busy for us.

40:30.762 --> 40:33.863
- ROB: What, what? C'mon, fast.
What's the question?

40:34.065 --> 40:36.299
- Rob, we just wanted to get
clarity on what you do

40:36.301 --> 40:37.700
with the gun crime?

40:37.702 --> 40:39.869
How you plan on keeping it
out of the city.

40:39.871 --> 40:42.372
- I don't know. That's what I'm
going to sit down

40:42.374 --> 40:44.274
with the Prime Minister
to find out.

40:44.276 --> 40:46.676
You know, about how our
immigration laws work.

40:46.678 --> 40:49.479
No, obviously, I have an idea,
but whatever I can do

40:49.481 --> 40:52.215
to get them out of this city,
I'm going to.

40:52.217 --> 40:53.850
- Thanks, Paula. Thanks.
- All right.

40:53.852 --> 40:57.053
- C'mon! Don't do the bullshit
Macarena for me, c'mon!

40:57.055 --> 40:58.755
Step it up, c'mon!

40:59.791 --> 41:01.257
- Set.

41:01.259 --> 41:02.759
Hut.

41:02.761 --> 41:05.795
- Hey, come on, Jack.
Let's go! Let's go!

41:11.136 --> 41:12.802
(sighs)

41:13.004 --> 41:14.337
- Any movement?

41:14.339 --> 41:16.739
- Um, not yet. I can't
get a hold of him yet.

41:16.741 --> 41:19.542
- You have anyone
else to speak to?

41:21.246 --> 41:22.946
Yeah!

41:24.149 --> 41:25.415
- Hey, David.

41:25.417 --> 41:27.250
- Uhh, yeah?

41:27.986 --> 41:29.919
- Uh, what would you do?

41:30.288 --> 41:31.688
- Uh, I'd have given this story

41:31.690 --> 41:34.057
to someone with a
little more experience.

41:34.059 --> 41:35.758
(scoffs)

41:37.429 --> 41:39.295
Uh, shit. I'm sorry.

41:39.297 --> 41:41.164
Look, um...

41:41.166 --> 41:42.966
Who else knows him?

41:42.968 --> 41:44.334
You're guy.

41:44.336 --> 41:46.035
- Right.
- Start there.

41:50.442 --> 41:52.141
- Okay.

41:56.815 --> 41:59.015
- Excuse me. Hey!
I was here last week

41:59.017 --> 42:02.018
on Wednesday. I don't know
if you were working, I...

42:02.020 --> 42:04.053
(gentle score begins)

42:05.090 --> 42:06.422
It's...

42:06.424 --> 42:08.124
Okay. All right.

42:18.069 --> 42:19.869
- Uh.

42:35.053 --> 42:36.586
- BRAM: Um, just a
couple of quick...

42:36.588 --> 42:37.954
<i> - WOMAN: Sorry.</i>
<i> - BRAM: All right.</i>

42:37.956 --> 42:39.455
- Oh. Hey!

42:39.457 --> 42:41.824
Uh, hey! Sorry!

42:41.826 --> 42:42.692
Hey, sorry.

42:42.694 --> 42:44.561
Um, do you work here?

42:44.563 --> 42:45.595
- I'm just an assistant.

42:45.597 --> 42:46.829
- Oh. Oh, that's great.

42:46.831 --> 42:48.164
I'm actually just looking
for someone to--

42:48.166 --> 42:49.599
to talk to about the mayor.

42:49.601 --> 42:50.967
- Sorry. I can't help you.

42:50.969 --> 42:53.236
- Okay, can I just--
If you just ever get some time.

42:53.238 --> 42:54.938
Sorry, here's my card.

42:57.842 --> 42:59.342
Thank you.

43:01.413 --> 43:03.012
Okay.

43:03.014 --> 43:04.147
Hey!

43:04.149 --> 43:05.548
So sorry. Uh, do you work here?

43:05.550 --> 43:06.716
- MAN: Sorry. Can't help you.

43:06.718 --> 43:08.751
- Can I just ask
just a few questions?

43:08.753 --> 43:11.788
- Really, can't help you, man.
- Really fast.

43:16.861 --> 43:19.195
- Firstly, what
the fuck is this?

43:19.197 --> 43:20.863
He wants to discuss immigration

43:20.865 --> 43:23.499
in connection to
reducing gun violence?

43:23.501 --> 43:24.567
- That's not
what he meant.

43:24.569 --> 43:25.702
- For a native English speaker,

43:25.704 --> 43:27.303
he sure needs
a lot of translation.

43:27.305 --> 43:28.972
From his immigrant aide.

43:28.974 --> 43:32.375
- He doesn't think of me as an
immigrant. Was there a secondly?

43:32.377 --> 43:33.643
(papers down on desk)

43:33.645 --> 43:35.878
- Yeah. We need to get
Josh an engagement gift.

43:35.880 --> 43:38.181
- Uh, I'm so sick of buying
people two presents

43:38.183 --> 43:39.148
for weddings.

43:39.150 --> 43:40.483
When you graduate,
you don't get a gift

43:40.485 --> 43:41.684
when you announce
you're graduating

43:41.686 --> 43:42.919
and then again when you
actually graduate.

43:42.921 --> 43:44.387
- You got a graduation gift?

43:44.389 --> 43:47.223
- I think Gidda got me a $50
gift certificate to The Keg.

43:47.225 --> 43:49.459
- Question: what does Rob
think you're speaking

43:49.461 --> 43:50.927
when you call your
grandmother Gidda?

43:50.929 --> 43:53.062
- He thinks I'm speaking
parseltongue.

43:56.101 --> 43:58.901
- That's because you're his
fucking spin wizard.

44:01.072 --> 44:02.772
- You, uh...

44:03.375 --> 44:05.041
You wanna get married?

44:05.043 --> 44:06.576
- Like, to you?

44:06.578 --> 44:08.277
- Maybe?

44:08.513 --> 44:10.079
- We don't even have cable.

44:10.081 --> 44:11.080
- We download.

44:11.082 --> 44:13.983
- I mean, it would just feel
really classy to say

44:13.985 --> 44:15.818
"I saw something on
HBO last night"

44:15.820 --> 44:18.655
rather than clicking through
some website offering me

44:18.657 --> 44:21.090
Ron Jeremy's Secret to
Enlarging My Dick 50 times.

44:21.092 --> 44:22.692
- You know, if you
buy his secret,

44:22.694 --> 44:24.394
the message stops popping up.

44:24.396 --> 44:25.828
- I did buy it.

44:25.830 --> 44:27.964
I can't believe you haven't
noticed my enlarged dick.

44:27.966 --> 44:28.931
- I have.

44:28.933 --> 44:30.466
Haven't you noticed mine?

44:30.468 --> 44:32.168
- Nope.

44:38.143 --> 44:39.842
(gentle score begins)

45:04.903 --> 45:06.803
- You have to give me
a couple of days

45:06.805 --> 45:08.571
before you do anything here.

45:08.573 --> 45:10.206
I can't help you
if my hands are tied

45:10.208 --> 45:12.308
and my hands get tied when
something hits, so...

45:12.310 --> 45:14.310
<i> - ABE: Look, just look:</i>

45:14.312 --> 45:17.013
<i> you said you would have an</i>
<i> answer, maybe by yesterday.</i>

45:17.015 --> 45:19.148
- I'm just trying to help you.
Just help me do that.

45:19.150 --> 45:20.850
Just hold off.

45:21.653 --> 45:23.419
<i> - Fine.</i>

45:23.421 --> 45:25.154
<i> Fine.</i>

45:42.474 --> 45:43.506
- Hey.

45:43.508 --> 45:44.907
- Thank you for- I just,

45:44.909 --> 45:46.743
I didn't think that anybody
would actually respond--

45:46.745 --> 45:48.878
- What were you looking for?

45:50.115 --> 45:52.081
- Oh, um, I...

45:52.550 --> 45:53.916
I know you work for the mayor

45:53.918 --> 45:55.985
and, you know,
people hear things.

45:55.987 --> 45:58.187
But, I just, I thought that,

45:58.189 --> 46:00.857
um, I don't know, I thought
that maybe somebody

46:00.859 --> 46:02.759
might know something?

46:05.497 --> 46:06.963
- You won't use my name?

46:06.965 --> 46:09.332
- No. Not if you don't want.

46:12.003 --> 46:15.037
- I don't want my
voice on that thing.

46:15.740 --> 46:17.140
(recording off)

46:17.142 --> 46:18.841
(utter silence)

46:22.647 --> 46:24.080
- ASHLEY: Doesn't matter
what you come up with,

46:24.082 --> 46:26.282
they'll just build more condos.

46:26.284 --> 46:28.050
Condos, condos, condos.

46:28.052 --> 46:30.219
- Wow! That took how long?
Two months?

46:30.221 --> 46:32.555
- For me to become
a jaded asshole?

46:32.557 --> 46:33.856
I was born this way, baby.

46:33.858 --> 46:35.625
- See? If you'd been a
lawyer, you wouldn't--

46:35.627 --> 46:37.093
- No! I am a lawyer.

46:37.095 --> 46:38.995
- Just not at her practice
'cause who needs the practice?

46:38.997 --> 46:41.030
- If I actually got hired
out of practice

46:41.032 --> 46:43.566
to practise as a
practising lawyer,

46:43.568 --> 46:45.101
I'd never get to be
the token gay

46:45.103 --> 46:47.770
for a politician to say,
"One of my assistants is gay."

46:47.772 --> 46:49.405
- Great clipping for the
Pollock fridge;

46:49.407 --> 46:50.907
making Mama Pollock proud.

46:50.909 --> 46:52.341
- Well, let's not go crazy.

46:52.343 --> 46:54.710
- But you do know
you can do anything

46:54.712 --> 46:56.212
with a law degree, right?

46:56.214 --> 46:57.513
- Uh, no.

46:57.515 --> 47:00.650
Everyone treats a law degree
like a Disney fast pass

47:00.652 --> 47:02.919
into any career but law.

47:02.921 --> 47:06.255
Except a Disney fast pass
can't get you into Universal.

47:06.257 --> 47:07.323
(laughter)

47:07.325 --> 47:09.258
- ROB: I'm down here.
- MAN 2: Mister Mayor!

47:09.260 --> 47:11.460
- ROB: A little beer
on a Friday night.

47:11.462 --> 47:14.397
Different offices...
Having a little party tonight.

47:14.399 --> 47:16.365
People celebrating.

47:16.367 --> 47:18.401
No, gravy train in here.

47:18.403 --> 47:19.969
No! We gotta-

47:19.971 --> 47:22.839
Ahhh! And here's my Claire.

47:22.841 --> 47:25.474
And she's in charge

47:25.476 --> 47:27.176
of stray animals.

47:27.679 --> 47:29.478
Ah, Georgie! There's Georgie.

47:29.981 --> 47:31.881
Organize my parties.

47:32.851 --> 47:35.017
These two, that Debbie, is John.

47:35.019 --> 47:37.987
Hey, don't drink too much beer.

47:38.790 --> 47:41.624
He fixes all the potholes.
He's in transit and,

47:41.626 --> 47:43.726
uh, potholes. Everything...

47:43.728 --> 47:45.661
Those potholes.

47:45.663 --> 47:47.997
Hey, Steve! Hey, uh.

47:47.999 --> 47:51.534
Ah, I got him!
I got the fucker! Got him.

47:51.669 --> 47:53.069
(laughter)

47:53.071 --> 47:55.238
You wanna picture?
Take a picture.

47:55.240 --> 47:57.106
<i> - MAN 3: Smile!</i>

48:02.814 --> 48:04.647
- Oh, look it here.

48:04.649 --> 48:06.349
Lookin' Fletcher.

48:09.454 --> 48:11.387
What's Fletcher call you?
What's your name?

48:11.389 --> 48:12.622
- Zach. It's Zach.

48:12.624 --> 48:15.057
- Don't talk when
I speak to you!

48:19.330 --> 48:21.430
It's joking.

48:21.432 --> 48:23.699
No, no, it's joking.

48:23.701 --> 48:25.835
It's joking, I'm joking.

48:25.837 --> 48:28.204
I enjoy-- I don't mind the kids.

48:38.449 --> 48:40.616
But your fucking boss?

48:40.618 --> 48:42.952
No. Fuck her!

48:43.488 --> 48:45.621
- All right, let's, uh,
let's get back to work.

48:45.623 --> 48:48.791
- Always workin', everyone.
Relax 'em, if you let them.

48:48.793 --> 48:50.293
- Rob, Rob, let's... Let's--

48:50.295 --> 48:51.460
- No!

48:51.462 --> 48:53.162
No, I said no!

48:54.032 --> 48:56.432
And I'm the charge. Me!

49:07.979 --> 49:09.679
Message for Fletcher:

49:11.382 --> 49:13.082
right here,

49:13.351 --> 49:15.051
you gotta give her.

49:15.520 --> 49:17.086
Got it?

49:17.088 --> 49:18.988
Write or email her face.

49:20.358 --> 49:22.024
Mm?

49:22.026 --> 49:23.559
Come, come here.

49:23.561 --> 49:24.694
Oh, good.

49:24.696 --> 49:26.295
All right. You got it?

49:26.297 --> 49:27.530
- Yep.

49:27.532 --> 49:28.898
(humming)

49:29.133 --> 49:30.633
- Got it?
- Oh, yeah. I got it, Rob.

49:30.635 --> 49:32.001
- You got it?
- I got it, Rob.

49:32.003 --> 49:33.169
- You got it?

49:33.171 --> 49:34.670
- Yep.

49:36.341 --> 49:37.840
- Got it?
- Yes!

49:37.842 --> 49:39.075
- KAMAL: Rob. Rob, come on.

49:39.077 --> 49:40.843
- Kamal? Kamal? Seriously!

49:40.845 --> 49:41.844
- Okay.
- Mm-hm.

49:41.846 --> 49:42.845
- Yeah?

49:42.847 --> 49:44.280
- Listen to me, Rob...

49:44.282 --> 49:45.548
- ROB: Move!

49:45.550 --> 49:46.282
Yeah?

49:46.284 --> 49:47.083
Mm.

49:47.085 --> 49:49.251
- Huh? You got it?
- Yes!

49:49.253 --> 49:52.521
- Get the message so we gotta
can hear it nice and loud, okay?

49:52.523 --> 49:53.622
You got it?
- Yes!

49:53.624 --> 49:54.690
- The message?

49:54.692 --> 49:55.891
- Yes!

49:55.893 --> 49:57.693
- You gotta say it loud.
Or else you gotta can't hear.

49:57.695 --> 49:59.128
- Yes!
- Hm?

49:59.130 --> 50:00.730
- Rob, don't!
(muffled cries)

50:00.732 --> 50:02.665
- You gonna tell us?

50:02.667 --> 50:05.434
You gonna give it to her?
You gonna give it to her?

50:05.436 --> 50:07.003
You gonna tell us?

50:07.005 --> 50:08.704
(yelling)

50:11.109 --> 50:13.009
(heavy breathing)

50:17.849 --> 50:19.248
(laughing)

50:19.250 --> 50:21.617
- Tougher than his
fucked-up boss, this Jew.

50:21.619 --> 50:23.552
- KAMAL: All right, come here.

50:23.988 --> 50:25.154
Come on. Come here.

50:25.156 --> 50:27.056
- Oh, you're cocoa???

50:27.859 --> 50:29.925
- Oh, it's your
fuckin' girlfriend.

50:29.927 --> 50:32.161
Is she bringing the coffees?

50:32.163 --> 50:34.263
We didn't want one
of those yet, Alice.

50:34.265 --> 50:35.998
We're still starting
before we want coffee.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.367
- KAMAL: Rob, let's
go sit down. C'mon.

50:39.137 --> 50:41.037
- You like Kamal?

50:42.240 --> 50:43.939
Do you?

50:43.941 --> 50:45.641
I love Kamal.

50:46.377 --> 50:48.077
Hnh...

50:49.480 --> 50:51.113
But I think maybe

50:51.115 --> 50:53.182
you love him in the
different way.

50:53.184 --> 50:55.084
(breathing heavily)

50:56.120 --> 51:00.556
I sort of think I hope
that you love him the way I do,

51:00.758 --> 51:02.925
'Cuz then you don't
care about him.

51:03.461 --> 51:05.828
- Rob, I got something
for you here. Come here.

51:05.830 --> 51:07.063
- Yeah? What is it?

51:07.065 --> 51:09.432
- Yeah. Come-come here,
I'll show you.

51:18.643 --> 51:20.342
Rob.

51:27.185 --> 51:30.586
Rob, come on. Come-come on.
Come 'ere!

51:30.588 --> 51:31.921
- All right. All right.

51:31.923 --> 51:36.092
I'm just talking to just talk
with my workers, huh? Ya' think?

51:37.995 --> 51:39.695
I banged your pussy!!

51:51.209 --> 51:53.242
Will ya show 'em
to the office?

51:53.244 --> 51:54.276
- You know where it is.

51:54.278 --> 51:56.178
- So we can show...

51:56.981 --> 51:58.380
- KAMAL: Come on. Let's go.

51:58.382 --> 52:00.649
- ROB: Show me some respect,
will ya?

52:00.651 --> 52:02.351
Show some respect!

52:08.960 --> 52:10.659
(deep inhale and exhale)

52:12.964 --> 52:14.630
- ASHLEY: Sure.

52:14.632 --> 52:15.998
(sniffles)

52:16.434 --> 52:18.801
- Um, so you didn't report it?

52:19.837 --> 52:21.837
- Everybody saw.

52:21.839 --> 52:25.641
I don't know who I'd tell
that wasn't already aware.

52:25.643 --> 52:26.675
- Oh.

52:26.677 --> 52:30.212
Did you report on that
party a few months ago?

52:30.515 --> 52:31.747
The CJPAC thing.

52:31.749 --> 52:35.784
- Oh, um, I-I know about it,
yeah, but I didn't, um...

52:35.786 --> 52:37.720
I wasn't on it. So, no.

52:39.891 --> 52:41.824
- All I thought-- I mean...

52:43.060 --> 52:44.760
besides

52:44.962 --> 52:46.662
"don't cry"...

52:47.098 --> 52:49.932
All I could think about
was the CJPAC thing.

52:50.601 --> 52:52.301
- Why?

52:52.703 --> 52:54.904
- Because we buried her.

52:54.906 --> 52:56.305
That woman?

52:56.307 --> 52:59.742
We said that she was crazy;
that she had a vendetta.

53:01.512 --> 53:03.212
So nobody cared.

53:07.618 --> 53:10.052
- So do you think that
you'll leave,

53:10.054 --> 53:11.754
um, the job?

53:14.225 --> 53:16.825
- My parents don't
pay my rent, so...

53:26.037 --> 53:27.536
- Any time you run up
to me like that

53:27.538 --> 53:28.804
it's because you think
you have a story.

53:28.806 --> 53:29.972
- I do.

53:29.973 --> 53:31.139
- Well, I hope it's what you
were assigned this morning

53:31.142 --> 53:32.558
for this afternoon's deadline.

53:32.559 --> 53:33.975
- Yes, I did that after
I got this story. I did both.

53:33.978 --> 53:35.494
- No gold stars
for extra work.

53:35.495 --> 53:37.011
- Right, right. Just look, I get
it. Please listen to me, okay?

53:37.014 --> 53:39.248
Just listen: I spoke to this
girl who works at city hall

53:39.250 --> 53:40.849
and she has all these
stories about how

53:40.851 --> 53:41.750
they can't control him.

53:41.752 --> 53:43.285
Okay, he came back
the other night

53:43.286 --> 53:44.819
out of his mind. Okay. She
doesn't want us to use her name

53:44.822 --> 53:47.189
but she said that apparently
it's not the first time

53:47.191 --> 53:49.325
that he showed up like that.

53:57.101 --> 53:58.601
That's my story.

53:58.736 --> 54:00.236
Okay, but this is not
even all of it. She--

54:00.238 --> 54:02.204
- No, that's not your story.
That's not your name at the top.

54:02.206 --> 54:03.739
Not your story.
They got to it first.

54:03.741 --> 54:06.041
- Yeah, okay, well, if you
let me try, I could be first.

54:06.043 --> 54:07.810
Okay? I'm doing this
in my spare time.

54:07.812 --> 54:10.246
Okay? I'm writing lists still,
which is-- that's,

54:10.248 --> 54:12.014
that is fine, but...

54:12.016 --> 54:13.515
But I could do this if
it was my priority.

54:13.517 --> 54:15.417
Okay? I could've been first.

54:17.488 --> 54:19.722
- Anything from
your vanishing man?

54:23.294 --> 54:25.261
You see, the one thing that
sort of makes this okay

54:25.263 --> 54:27.129
is that 'cause you
had to pitch it,

54:27.131 --> 54:28.530
it's not me that looks
little league

54:28.532 --> 54:30.699
because your source disappeared.

54:30.701 --> 54:32.334
Now Judith thinks they
got paid to go away

54:32.336 --> 54:34.236
and you missed your chance.

54:34.238 --> 54:35.938
You know what I think?

54:36.707 --> 54:39.742
I think he also realized
you were an amateur.

54:47.985 --> 54:49.685
Go back to your desk.

54:52.023 --> 54:54.356
(loud mechanical sounds)

55:00.464 --> 55:02.965
- Hey! Um... I left
a bunch of messages for you.

55:02.967 --> 55:04.667
I guess you are...

55:05.569 --> 55:08.070
I don't know, I guess you're
going with someone else. Um...

55:08.072 --> 55:10.439
It's Bram. We met
at the laundromat.

55:11.042 --> 55:12.741
But, uh...

55:14.412 --> 55:16.779
Look, I'm young,
I know. But, um,

55:17.882 --> 55:19.615
I am not an amateur, though.

55:20.151 --> 55:22.851
Uh, thought that I would get to
do more interesting things

55:22.853 --> 55:24.553
at my job and then,

55:25.523 --> 55:27.523
I don't know. I-I
guess when we met,

55:27.525 --> 55:29.892
I thought you were going to be
that guy to give me that chance.

55:29.894 --> 55:31.727
But... Um...

55:31.729 --> 55:35.130
I can't show you what I can do
unless you let me do it.

55:35.132 --> 55:36.832
So...

55:37.868 --> 55:39.568
Um...

55:39.737 --> 55:41.236
Yeah. Just--

55:41.405 --> 55:42.871
Good luck with it.

55:42.873 --> 55:46.575
Uh, I really hope whoever
tells your story tells it right.

55:58.356 --> 55:59.755
(baby crying)

55:59.757 --> 56:01.590
- Can you put your phone down
for five minutes?

56:01.592 --> 56:04.793
Actually, pictures! Hold on.
Just one minute.

56:05.596 --> 56:07.563
- Mom said Neil
interviewed for Google.

56:07.565 --> 56:09.698
- JILL: No, no, no!
That wasn't the important part.

56:09.700 --> 56:11.500
Brammy's on a case,
is what I said.

56:11.502 --> 56:12.401
- Yeah, what's happening
with that?

56:12.403 --> 56:13.435
- Hi, birthday boy.

56:13.437 --> 56:14.503
- Nothing. It doesn't
work like that.

56:14.505 --> 56:16.071
- What case?
- He met a man!

56:16.073 --> 56:17.373
- It's nothing.

56:17.375 --> 56:19.174
- PHIL: Well, how, how does
it work? You don't tell us.

56:19.176 --> 56:20.476
- He's Deep Throat!

56:20.478 --> 56:22.077
- Okay, don't! That's not--

56:22.079 --> 56:23.512
I'm not, I'm not doing anything.

56:23.514 --> 56:24.980
- No, I mean, he's working
on something.

56:24.982 --> 56:27.149
They put him on a job. When are
we going to read about it?

56:27.151 --> 56:28.484
- I don't know, you're not!

56:28.486 --> 56:30.486
- JILL: He's like Glenn
Greenwald! Just tell her!

56:30.488 --> 56:32.888
- Okay. A guy called me
and told me a story,

56:32.890 --> 56:34.957
which turned out to be nothing,
so I got reamed out at work

56:34.959 --> 56:37.159
and I'm just doing lists
and that's it because that's

56:37.161 --> 56:38.260
what a journalist does now.

56:38.262 --> 56:39.228
So, until there's
some major shift

56:39.230 --> 56:40.295
in the way that things
are reported,

56:40.297 --> 56:41.630
just please do not ask me.

56:41.632 --> 56:43.132
- They're just trying
to understand what you do.

56:43.134 --> 56:44.500
- Sammi!

56:44.502 --> 56:46.635
- PHIL: You can't talk to him
when he's like this.

56:46.637 --> 56:49.238
- JILL: Oh, did you know
Connie Chung converted?

56:49.907 --> 56:53.075
- EVERYONE (SINGING):
Happy Birthday to you...

56:53.077 --> 56:55.677
Happy birthday to you.

56:55.679 --> 56:59.348
Happy birthday, dear Jack,

56:59.350 --> 57:02.751
Happy birthday to you.

57:02.753 --> 57:04.420
(Jack screams)

57:04.422 --> 57:05.788
- We're going.

57:05.790 --> 57:07.256
- Bye.

57:07.258 --> 57:08.991
- That was annoying.

57:08.993 --> 57:10.259
- Which part?

57:10.261 --> 57:12.394
- I mean, I guess
I get it, a little.

57:12.396 --> 57:13.896
- Which part
of which part?

57:13.898 --> 57:16.732
- Ah! You got the first job
you applied for out of the gate.

57:16.734 --> 57:17.666
- Internship.

57:17.668 --> 57:19.001
- They're paying you, now.

57:19.002 --> 57:20.335
But you are lucky that you
don't have to worry about money.

57:20.337 --> 57:21.403
We're lucky.

57:21.405 --> 57:22.838
- Yes, I know. I know that.

57:22.840 --> 57:24.873
But I can't feel frustrated
because everyone's

57:24.875 --> 57:26.208
knee-jerk reaction is
"You're so lucky.

57:26.210 --> 57:27.409
You don't have to
feel frustrated."

57:27.411 --> 57:28.811
- You know, at Versailles,

57:28.813 --> 57:30.546
Marie-Antoinette had this
peasant's village built,

57:30.548 --> 57:32.448
like a fake one.
She wanted to feel

57:32.450 --> 57:34.450
like she was doing something,
so she built this shack

57:34.452 --> 57:36.552
where she could milk cows
and, like, I don't know,

57:36.554 --> 57:38.053
tend to the earth.

57:38.055 --> 57:40.422
- Okay, honestly, I can't begin
to do the mental gymnastics

57:40.424 --> 57:42.458
to untangle that, but I'm just
very happy for you

57:42.460 --> 57:44.626
that you found a use
for your major in history.

57:44.628 --> 57:46.929
- It's sort of tough to complain
when you have an $800 machine

57:46.931 --> 57:48.931
in your hand that could land
Apollo 13.

57:48.933 --> 57:51.800
You are a young, well-off,
relatively intelligent,

57:51.802 --> 57:52.568
white male.

57:52.570 --> 57:53.669
- Marie-Antoinette was beheaded

57:53.671 --> 57:55.003
along with her
white, male husband.

57:55.005 --> 57:57.739
- What could you possibly
feel disaffected about?

57:57.741 --> 57:59.241
- Maybe the fact that
I'm supposed to be

57:59.243 --> 58:02.110
super-content and happy and
everything's supposed to come

58:02.112 --> 58:03.846
very easily to me, so

58:03.848 --> 58:06.048
whenever I find myself having
moments of perfectly normal

58:06.050 --> 58:08.750
human sadness, or fear,

58:08.752 --> 58:09.985
or doubt,

58:09.987 --> 58:11.753
nobody takes it seriously.

58:11.755 --> 58:13.522
And Apollo 13 didn't land.

58:13.524 --> 58:15.224
- Well, that's 'cause
they didn't have the phone.

58:15.226 --> 58:17.526
- That's because no one checked
to make sure that the people

58:17.528 --> 58:18.861
they were sending into nowhere

58:18.863 --> 58:20.529
were in a vehicle that wouldn't
blow up in their faces.

58:20.531 --> 58:22.397
They just trusted that
the shuttle they were in

58:22.399 --> 58:23.699
point A to point B

58:23.701 --> 58:25.634
because that's what
they were told.

58:26.136 --> 58:29.605
- Listen! I-I tried. I tried
to figure something out.

58:31.141 --> 58:32.841
Hold on.

58:33.744 --> 58:35.777
If you come out with this...

58:35.779 --> 58:37.279
Hello?

58:40.217 --> 58:41.917
(tense score begins)

1:00:09.173 --> 1:00:10.872
(text arriving ding)

1:00:11.442 --> 1:00:13.141
(typewriter keys clacking)

1:00:16.447 --> 1:00:18.146
(message arriving whoop)

1:00:20.284 --> 1:00:21.984
(message sending swoop)

1:00:30.861 --> 1:00:32.761
(typewriter keys clacking)

1:00:35.065 --> 1:00:36.965
(typewriter keys clacking
very quickly)

1:00:52.416 --> 1:00:54.116
(typewriter keys clacking)

1:01:10.167 --> 1:01:11.867
(car engine rumbling)

1:01:15.773 --> 1:01:18.740
- Hey, did I tell you I ran into
Becky Blidner on the subway?

1:01:18.742 --> 1:01:21.243
She was wearing a suit.
Where are we?

1:01:21.245 --> 1:01:23.311
- She's probably miserable
and going home.

1:01:23.313 --> 1:01:26.048
- Well, no, it was the morning.
How long are you gonna be?

1:01:26.050 --> 1:01:27.949
- She's probably miserable
and going to work.

1:01:27.951 --> 1:01:29.851
- I was coming back
from an interview.

1:01:29.853 --> 1:01:31.787
We're supposed
to meet them by 11.

1:01:31.789 --> 1:01:33.388
- Yeah, we'll get there.

1:01:33.390 --> 1:01:35.123
- On Bram time.

1:01:35.392 --> 1:01:37.192
Google's opening an office here.

1:01:37.194 --> 1:01:38.593
- Ah, here.

1:01:38.595 --> 1:01:40.295
- Where?

1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:44.933
- I blew it, anyway.
They ask you all these questions

1:01:44.935 --> 1:01:46.868
that nobody can answer,
by the way, like,

1:01:46.870 --> 1:01:48.870
how many times in a day
does a clock's hands overlap?

1:01:48.872 --> 1:01:50.839
- How much do you
think this house cost?

1:01:50.841 --> 1:01:53.408
- I don't know.
It was 22, somehow.

1:01:53.410 --> 1:01:56.945
- He paid just under 300
for it, like, ten years ago.

1:01:56.947 --> 1:01:58.180
- Who?

1:01:58.182 --> 1:02:01.049
- Rob. If you bought it now
it'd cost, like, $900,000.

1:02:01.051 --> 1:02:04.286
- Okay, Bram, are you fucked?
What are we even doing here?

1:02:04.288 --> 1:02:05.487
- The guy's not answering me.

1:02:05.489 --> 1:02:08.690
- He's not answering you?
I wonder what that's like?

1:02:08.692 --> 1:02:09.958
We should go.

1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:11.493
- Look, if he's not real,
then I'm updating Twitter

1:02:11.495 --> 1:02:13.195
with links to some intern's
lists until they realize

1:02:13.197 --> 1:02:14.996
that interns can write lists
and tweet.

1:02:14.998 --> 1:02:16.832
- Maybe it's better
if he's not real.

1:02:16.834 --> 1:02:18.667
- You know how much
his father was worth?

1:02:18.669 --> 1:02:19.968
- Honestly, I don't care.

1:02:19.970 --> 1:02:21.636
- Everything he has
he can thank his dad for.

1:02:21.638 --> 1:02:23.705
- As we sit in your dad's Benz.

1:02:23.707 --> 1:02:25.107
Let's go, seriously.

1:02:25.109 --> 1:02:26.775
- Wait, why do you
think it's not real?

1:02:26.777 --> 1:02:28.009
- I said that it might not be,

1:02:28.011 --> 1:02:29.211
it's probably better
if it's not.

1:02:29.213 --> 1:02:30.712
- The guy's the mayor
and he's on camera

1:02:30.714 --> 1:02:32.347
smoking crack in a crack den.

1:02:32.349 --> 1:02:33.515
- Allegedly.

1:02:33.684 --> 1:02:35.050
- Allegedly.

1:02:35.052 --> 1:02:36.485
I wouldn't even know
where to find crack,

1:02:36.487 --> 1:02:37.819
let alone a den full of it.

1:02:37.821 --> 1:02:39.421
- Well, maybe you should start
by asking the guy

1:02:39.423 --> 1:02:40.622
that deals you weed.

1:02:40.624 --> 1:02:41.823
- Oh, yeah, I'm sure that
Noah Schwartz

1:02:41.825 --> 1:02:43.258
of Congregation
Sheket Bevakasha--

1:02:43.260 --> 1:02:44.860
- Hey!

1:02:44.862 --> 1:02:48.296
- ...knows all the finest crack
and opium dens in Forest Hill.

1:02:48.298 --> 1:02:50.232
- I wish opium dens
were still a thing.

1:02:50.234 --> 1:02:51.733
- And-and that's
not the same thing.

1:02:51.735 --> 1:02:52.801
- Oh, yeah, no.

1:02:52.803 --> 1:02:55.504
Crack is whack,
opium is dope-ium.

1:02:55.939 --> 1:02:58.173
- I met the guy. He's real.

1:02:58.175 --> 1:03:00.008
- You know, isn't there
this whole subset of journalism

1:03:00.010 --> 1:03:02.778
where you get to make up
wildly inaccurate shit,

1:03:02.780 --> 1:03:04.813
tweet it to the masses
and still get some of your own

1:03:04.815 --> 1:03:06.248
press while doing so?

1:03:06.250 --> 1:03:09.684
That way, it's sort of worth it
when they expose you.

1:03:09.686 --> 1:03:11.153
- How is that worth it?

1:03:11.155 --> 1:03:12.888
- You get your
own Wikipedia page.

1:03:12.890 --> 1:03:14.923
(bang on window!)

1:03:16.126 --> 1:03:17.959
- What did you think you were
going to find sitting outside

1:03:17.961 --> 1:03:19.361
of his house? I'm just curious.

1:03:19.363 --> 1:03:22.030
- If he-if he left I could see
where he went for myself

1:03:22.032 --> 1:03:25.467
and not just from other people
on Instagram the next day.

1:03:25.469 --> 1:03:26.768
(chuckles)

1:03:26.770 --> 1:03:28.470
- You told the cops you were
working on a story

1:03:28.472 --> 1:03:30.305
for the paper, is that right?

1:03:30.307 --> 1:03:32.007
- I am!

1:03:33.577 --> 1:03:35.076
- I don't know if I didn't
make myself clear

1:03:35.078 --> 1:03:36.745
or if you have a drug problem
I'm not aware of--

1:03:36.747 --> 1:03:38.713
- Yes! Yes, I fucked up. I know.

1:03:38.715 --> 1:03:40.715
- Well, I'm glad
that got through.

1:03:40.717 --> 1:03:43.652
Look at me: you do not
pitch stories!

1:03:43.654 --> 1:03:45.053
You are assigned things!

1:03:45.055 --> 1:03:47.355
You do not use the paper's name
when you are caught

1:03:47.357 --> 1:03:50.158
staking out the mayor's house.
You get it?

1:03:50.594 --> 1:03:52.294
- I'm sorry.

1:03:59.169 --> 1:04:00.836
- You know, I actually wish we
were paying you more,

1:04:00.838 --> 1:04:02.470
I really do.

1:04:02.472 --> 1:04:05.941
That way we could just
cut you from the budget.

1:04:07.077 --> 1:04:10.111
It's funny how when you're
dispensable you're actually not.

1:04:26.430 --> 1:04:28.129
(phone ringing)

1:04:28.398 --> 1:04:30.098
- This is Ashley.

1:04:30.634 --> 1:04:32.334
Hi.

1:04:35.205 --> 1:04:36.905
A-about what?

1:04:40.377 --> 1:04:41.643
(scoffs)

1:04:41.645 --> 1:04:43.345
What?

1:04:44.948 --> 1:04:46.648
(score begins)

1:04:47.117 --> 1:04:48.683
I'll have to call you
back on that.

1:04:57.294 --> 1:04:58.727
- What?

1:04:58.729 --> 1:05:00.428
(cell phone buzzes)

1:05:08.839 --> 1:05:11.673
- Hey! I didn't know
what happened to you.

1:05:12.009 --> 1:05:14.109
Well, that's hard to say
without seeing, uh,

1:05:14.111 --> 1:05:17.145
what we're paying for.
How much were you thinking?

1:05:17.381 --> 1:05:18.446
Well...

1:05:18.448 --> 1:05:20.415
Well, they won't go above
your asking price,

1:05:20.417 --> 1:05:23.451
so you should definitely
start higher than you want.

1:05:26.757 --> 1:05:28.456
300,000.

1:05:28.759 --> 1:05:30.759
- I hope we're
discussing lira.

1:05:30.761 --> 1:05:31.860
- Does anyone still use lira?

1:05:31.862 --> 1:05:32.727
- Lebanon.

1:05:32.729 --> 1:05:33.662
- No, they have the pound.

1:05:33.664 --> 1:05:34.763
- Well, they
call it a lira.

1:05:34.765 --> 1:05:36.031
- Turkey has the lira. Stop.

1:05:36.033 --> 1:05:38.233
We're not paying 300,000
anything for a video.

1:05:38.235 --> 1:05:40.602
- Well, he started with 150.

1:05:40.604 --> 1:05:42.570
- You negotiated up?

1:05:43.006 --> 1:05:46.041
- No, no. Um, he said that
they wouldn't go below 150

1:05:46.043 --> 1:05:47.709
and so I said that
he should start higher

1:05:47.711 --> 1:05:49.744
so there's room to negotiate.

1:05:49.746 --> 1:05:51.546
- So you negotiated up.

1:05:51.548 --> 1:05:54.182
- If the Globe knows,
all the papers know.

1:05:54.184 --> 1:05:55.417
One of them is gonna get it.

1:05:55.419 --> 1:05:56.918
- Did they say how much
the guy was asking?

1:05:56.920 --> 1:05:58.520
We could offer them more.

1:05:58.522 --> 1:06:00.221
- Offer them more?

1:06:00.590 --> 1:06:02.057
- Let's offer
them ten grand.

1:06:02.059 --> 1:06:04.526
- For what? We haven't seen
what we're even discussing.

1:06:04.528 --> 1:06:06.861
If we're taking some guy
who disappeared for two weeks--

1:06:06.863 --> 1:06:08.563
- Three.

1:06:09.566 --> 1:06:11.533
- Three weeks!

1:06:11.535 --> 1:06:13.535
You're good. We're taking
some guy who disappeared

1:06:13.537 --> 1:06:15.937
for three weeks' word
that there is a video

1:06:15.939 --> 1:06:18.673
that someone may
want to see, maybe...

1:06:18.675 --> 1:06:19.975
Where are you supposed
to meet him?

1:06:19.977 --> 1:06:22.043
- We're not telling
anyone anything.

1:06:22.045 --> 1:06:24.179
- I was just asking if--

1:06:25.115 --> 1:06:27.649
I want to make sure it doesn't
look like we were lying

1:06:27.651 --> 1:06:29.250
when this eventually leaks.

1:06:29.252 --> 1:06:31.619
- You know what happens if this
leaks? He loses his job.

1:06:31.621 --> 1:06:34.055
And you know what happens
when he loses his?

1:06:34.057 --> 1:06:35.757
- If it leaks?

1:06:35.759 --> 1:06:36.825
- So, what's in the budget?

1:06:36.827 --> 1:06:38.860
- TMZ pays money
for these stories.

1:06:38.862 --> 1:06:40.528
- TMZ also has revenue.

1:06:40.530 --> 1:06:41.997
- We are a real newspaper

1:06:41.999 --> 1:06:43.531
and we have a responsibility
as journalists

1:06:43.533 --> 1:06:46.134
- We have a responsibility to
the city and, more importantly,

1:06:46.136 --> 1:06:48.236
to the people looking at your
bottom line every day

1:06:48.238 --> 1:06:51.239
where your salary is one of the
very brightest red numbers.

1:06:51.241 --> 1:06:53.775
Do you know what kind of traffic
this can pull to the site?

1:06:53.777 --> 1:06:54.976
- We are a newspaper!

1:06:54.978 --> 1:06:57.579
- We don't deal in news
anymore, Judith.

1:07:01.051 --> 1:07:02.751
(phone ringing)

1:07:05.956 --> 1:07:07.655
(phone ringing)

1:07:18.735 --> 1:07:20.835
- Oh, it's-it's just a
statement.

1:07:20.837 --> 1:07:22.904
Some questions...

1:07:22.906 --> 1:07:24.873
- I still work for the city.

1:07:24.875 --> 1:07:27.409
- I-I get it. We also do.

1:07:27.411 --> 1:07:30.478
We have the same boss,
technically, me and you.

1:07:30.480 --> 1:07:33.214
- Even if we were
to pay them something...

1:07:33.216 --> 1:07:35.917
we just fired people
to save money.

1:07:35.919 --> 1:07:38.586
We are not looking
to add expenses here.

1:07:38.588 --> 1:07:41.056
And they're looking
for a ridiculous amount.

1:07:41.058 --> 1:07:43.658
- But what if we, uh,
partnered with someone

1:07:43.660 --> 1:07:45.260
like they did on WikiLeaks?

1:07:45.262 --> 1:07:46.928
- I don't think The Times
or Der Spiegel would have

1:07:46.930 --> 1:07:49.397
the same level of interest they
had in the US State Department

1:07:49.399 --> 1:07:52.467
spying on the UN that they would
in a Canadian mayor

1:07:52.469 --> 1:07:53.635
smoking crack.

1:07:53.637 --> 1:07:55.837
And they didn't pay.

1:07:55.839 --> 1:07:57.405
- No, but I know
they got approached.

1:07:57.407 --> 1:07:58.907
The Star, probably
The Globe, too.

1:07:58.909 --> 1:08:00.075
- What?

1:08:00.077 --> 1:08:01.676
- Bram's guy spoke to them--
The Star.

1:08:01.678 --> 1:08:02.744
- How do you know that?

1:08:05.348 --> 1:08:08.683
- I know someone over there
that can't really keep a secret.

1:08:08.685 --> 1:08:10.285
- You think they're having the
same conversation

1:08:10.287 --> 1:08:12.654
about you at The Star right now?

1:08:15.192 --> 1:08:17.258
- Come here a second?

1:08:17.260 --> 1:08:19.861
- We can work it
around your schedule.

1:08:20.664 --> 1:08:22.597
- I have to think about it.

1:08:23.667 --> 1:08:25.800
- Well, what if we get Ashley,
that girl from his office?

1:08:25.802 --> 1:08:26.734
She wouldn't go on record,

1:08:26.736 --> 1:08:28.103
but what if we did
get her on record?

1:08:28.105 --> 1:08:29.504
- Nobody gives a fuck
about her story!

1:08:29.506 --> 1:08:33.241
They want to see a video
of a mayor smoking crack.

1:08:35.679 --> 1:08:37.045
- Yo.

1:08:37.047 --> 1:08:39.147
- Remember the budget increase
we voted against?

1:08:39.149 --> 1:08:40.115
Office expenses?

1:08:40.117 --> 1:08:41.516
- "Office expenses". Yeah.

1:08:41.518 --> 1:08:43.518
- It was voted through, but Rob
refused to take it.

1:08:43.520 --> 1:08:45.887
Where does it live?
The refused amount.

1:08:45.889 --> 1:08:47.422
- Technically?

1:08:47.424 --> 1:08:49.691
I guess it's in our
office purses

1:08:49.693 --> 1:08:51.726
and whatever surplus is left
at the end of fiscal

1:08:51.728 --> 1:08:53.128
goes back into the pot.

1:08:53.130 --> 1:08:56.131
- And they, uh, argued that
office means "office".

1:08:56.133 --> 1:08:57.765
Like, in the end,
they're using it for what?

1:08:57.767 --> 1:09:01.069
- Whatever. Dubman uses it
to sponsor a little league team.

1:09:01.071 --> 1:09:02.537
- You can use it
in your community?

1:09:02.539 --> 1:09:04.339
- You can. Why?

1:09:04.341 --> 1:09:06.541
- I wanna give to a community
charity using "office" expenses.

1:09:06.543 --> 1:09:07.709
Kosher?

1:09:07.711 --> 1:09:09.310
- Dubman and Inchens and them
do a "women's lunch"

1:09:09.312 --> 1:09:10.812
for themselves once in a while.

1:09:10.814 --> 1:09:12.780
It's charged to their offices,
so if the people of Toronto

1:09:12.782 --> 1:09:15.350
are unknowingly paying for
$20 kale Caesars,

1:09:15.352 --> 1:09:16.751
I'm sure they'll be fine
not knowing they're also

1:09:16.753 --> 1:09:17.585
giving to charity.

1:09:17.587 --> 1:09:18.319
- Great.

1:09:22.726 --> 1:09:24.092
- I want to know
what is on there,

1:09:24.094 --> 1:09:25.827
so make sure he thinks
we have more than we do.

1:09:30.267 --> 1:09:33.001
- This is good, Judith.

1:09:33.003 --> 1:09:34.068
You can smile.

1:09:34.871 --> 1:09:36.804
- Go back to your desk.

1:09:40.477 --> 1:09:42.177
(door closes)

1:09:54.624 --> 1:09:56.324
(paper tearing)

1:10:24.254 --> 1:10:25.954
(van side door slides shut)

1:11:11.268 --> 1:11:12.834
(van door closes)

1:11:12.836 --> 1:11:14.769
- What's good?

1:11:25.482 --> 1:11:27.615
- Should I put these on?

1:11:28.051 --> 1:11:30.418
- I mean, if you wanna listen.

1:12:46.396 --> 1:12:48.096
- All right, man.

1:12:49.065 --> 1:12:50.765
That's enough.

1:12:51.368 --> 1:12:53.134
- Can I watch it again?

1:12:53.136 --> 1:12:54.836
- Nah.

1:12:54.838 --> 1:12:56.537
Just one for free, man.

1:12:57.073 --> 1:12:58.573
- Were you there?

1:12:58.575 --> 1:13:00.041
(scoffs)

1:13:00.043 --> 1:13:01.642
- Yes.

1:13:01.644 --> 1:13:03.778
- Did you take the video?

1:13:06.049 --> 1:13:07.749
- He was there.

1:13:09.919 --> 1:13:11.619
- What's in the pipe?

1:13:13.022 --> 1:13:14.555
- Wha... Whadda you think, hm?

1:13:14.557 --> 1:13:16.724
- I'm just-I'm just makin' sure.

1:13:16.726 --> 1:13:21.396
- So, what are you maybe
thinking about the money?

1:13:22.699 --> 1:13:24.766
- I think we can
get you some.

1:13:24.768 --> 1:13:28.002
- Okay, so why don't you
tell your boss what you saw

1:13:28.004 --> 1:13:30.104
and, uh, tell me a number, hm?

1:13:38.815 --> 1:13:40.515
- Okay.

1:13:41.017 --> 1:13:42.717
Calm down.

1:13:43.353 --> 1:13:44.919
(exhales)

1:13:44.921 --> 1:13:46.621
Here's what you do.

1:13:53.296 --> 1:13:54.695
- Oh, hey!

1:13:54.697 --> 1:13:56.097
- Rob!

1:13:56.566 --> 1:13:59.834
- In a minute. Look,
a lot of people are here.

1:13:59.836 --> 1:14:01.903
It's all in how they wanna
cut the waste,

1:14:01.905 --> 1:14:04.405
stand here every day
to have their voices heard.

1:14:04.407 --> 1:14:06.007
Good. Thank you for coming.

1:14:06.009 --> 1:14:07.108
- Thanks. Thanks.

1:14:07.110 --> 1:14:08.276
- MAN: Hey, Rob.

1:14:08.278 --> 1:14:09.644
- Oh, hey! How are ya?
Thanks for comin'.

1:14:09.646 --> 1:14:12.680
- Hey! You're hiring
immigrants now, too, eh?

1:14:12.682 --> 1:14:14.515
Yeah, you should get
him a cab, not a suit.

1:14:14.517 --> 1:14:16.350
- No, no. Kamal's not...

1:14:16.352 --> 1:14:18.419
No, Kamal's good.
No, that's not right.

1:14:18.421 --> 1:14:19.720
- Ahhh, fuckin'
gravy train, Rob!

1:14:19.722 --> 1:14:21.756
- Yeah, you got it, man!
You got it.

1:14:21.758 --> 1:14:24.358
<i> - MAN: Pay a fine.</i>
<i> Ah, we just need...</i>

1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:25.426
<i> - WOMAN: Oh! That's him!</i>

1:14:25.428 --> 1:14:27.528
<i> - MAN: Um, just need...</i>

1:14:27.530 --> 1:14:29.897
- WOMAN 2: Oh! (laughing)

1:14:30.867 --> 1:14:34.068
- What kind of feeling
do you get from this guy?

1:14:34.070 --> 1:14:35.570
- What do you mean?

1:14:35.572 --> 1:14:38.172
- Well, all we know
about him is that

1:14:38.508 --> 1:14:40.641
whoever he's helping --
himself? Who knows?

1:14:40.643 --> 1:14:43.177
All we know is that they're
involved in drugs.

1:14:43.179 --> 1:14:45.046
Peripherally. Directly.

1:14:45.048 --> 1:14:48.783
And it's not like some kid
selling weed to some nerds

1:14:48.785 --> 1:14:50.918
playing gun games
in their basement.

1:14:52.489 --> 1:14:54.889
Who are we giving
this money to?

1:14:55.225 --> 1:14:58.259
We print murders every day --
gangs, whatever -- but...

1:15:00.530 --> 1:15:02.230
We're not bankrolling it.

1:15:02.832 --> 1:15:05.600
- Well if-- If someone
had a compromising video

1:15:05.602 --> 1:15:08.002
of someone in power and...

1:15:08.004 --> 1:15:10.171
I don't know, somehow they
used it as a chip

1:15:10.173 --> 1:15:11.873
with the office,

1:15:12.575 --> 1:15:15.209
then wouldn't it be better
for a paper to pay something?

1:15:15.211 --> 1:15:17.578
Rather than have that person

1:15:17.580 --> 1:15:19.180
hold some sort of power
that the people

1:15:19.182 --> 1:15:20.882
would be affected by?

1:15:25.388 --> 1:15:27.522
- Go buy us some clicks.

1:15:37.534 --> 1:15:39.233
(door closes)

1:16:09.632 --> 1:16:11.332
(cell phone ringing)

1:16:16.873 --> 1:16:19.907
- Hello? Yes, I just got here.
I'm fine.

1:16:21.411 --> 1:16:23.778
Mom. Mom, I'll call you back.

1:16:27.483 --> 1:16:29.183
(door opens)

1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:32.820
(door closes)

1:16:37.327 --> 1:16:39.026
(tense score begins)

1:16:51.741 --> 1:16:53.641
(door slams shut)

1:17:33.750 --> 1:17:35.383
- Wrote it anyways.

1:17:36.519 --> 1:17:37.869
- You wrote what?

1:17:37.870 --> 1:17:39.220
- What the video is;
what's on it, 'kay? I, I...

1:17:39.222 --> 1:17:41.288
We can just describe it.
I know what I saw and-and

1:17:41.290 --> 1:17:42.390
how to do it. Here, look...

1:17:42.392 --> 1:17:43.491
If people hear what's
on the video--

1:17:43.493 --> 1:17:44.859
- The people that'll
believe it will believe it

1:17:44.861 --> 1:17:45.993
and the one's that won't,
they won't.

1:17:45.995 --> 1:17:47.795
- No, no, no! Dave, Dave,
I think that if we just

1:17:47.797 --> 1:17:49.397
print this, then
it's pretty much--

1:17:49.399 --> 1:17:51.899
- Come here. Look. Come here.

1:17:54.203 --> 1:17:55.903
Look.

1:17:59.575 --> 1:18:01.342
- This is insane.

1:18:02.145 --> 1:18:03.778
- Why are you smiling?

1:18:05.381 --> 1:18:06.914
- Why aren't you?

1:18:07.684 --> 1:18:09.817
- Seriously? Seriously,
this is my story. This is-

1:18:09.819 --> 1:18:11.385
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
You gotta stop saying that.

1:18:11.387 --> 1:18:12.887
- This is-- They don't even have
the video, okay?

1:18:12.889 --> 1:18:14.021
They're just describing it.

1:18:14.023 --> 1:18:15.456
- They're raising
the money for it

1:18:15.458 --> 1:18:17.425
on top of the ten you gave away.

1:18:19.595 --> 1:18:21.529
- You're still here for
the same reasons I am.

1:18:21.531 --> 1:18:23.364
You could've bailed.

1:18:23.366 --> 1:18:25.399
- I need this job, too.

1:18:25.401 --> 1:18:26.333
But,

1:18:26.335 --> 1:18:28.035
maybe it's...

1:18:32.508 --> 1:18:35.309
Dude, if you've
smoked crack once

1:18:35.311 --> 1:18:38.846
in the past, does that impact
your ability to be mayor?

1:18:38.848 --> 1:18:40.614
I don't know. Maybe.

1:18:40.616 --> 1:18:42.316
It's a discussion. Fine.

1:18:43.619 --> 1:18:45.386
But if you get blackout
drunk enough

1:18:45.388 --> 1:18:48.956
that you can't remember the time
that you harassed someone?

1:18:50.660 --> 1:18:53.494
Then you should not
be mayor of this city.

1:18:56.999 --> 1:18:58.499
You know,

1:18:59.235 --> 1:19:01.869
I thought you would
say something to him;

1:19:02.905 --> 1:19:06.107
ask Rob to apologize
for what he said to me.

1:19:06.876 --> 1:19:08.142
But then I thought,

1:19:08.144 --> 1:19:10.344
"Maybe Kamal doesn't have
that much control

1:19:10.346 --> 1:19:12.046
over what Rob says".

1:19:15.251 --> 1:19:18.285
But you didn't even
say anything to me.

1:19:20.490 --> 1:19:22.189
It was just another day.

1:19:24.927 --> 1:19:26.827
I was just another woman.

1:19:28.364 --> 1:19:30.297
Another story for you to bury.

1:19:32.468 --> 1:19:34.168
- Fuck...

1:19:35.605 --> 1:19:37.304
(score begins)

1:19:44.747 --> 1:19:46.447
- I came in today...

1:19:49.652 --> 1:19:51.352
And there you guys were.

1:19:56.259 --> 1:19:57.958
And here we are.

1:19:59.829 --> 1:20:01.962
- And that's everything
you know?

1:20:03.166 --> 1:20:04.865
- Yeah.

1:20:07.904 --> 1:20:09.804
- You got anything else?

1:20:14.510 --> 1:20:16.010
(knocking on door)

1:20:17.246 --> 1:20:18.946
- Rob?

1:20:23.920 --> 1:20:26.120
- You know what the kids
are gonna say they find out

1:20:26.122 --> 1:20:27.188
I'm fired?

1:20:27.190 --> 1:20:29.623
- You can't get fired,
really. Not like that.

1:20:29.625 --> 1:20:31.625
- Yes, they can!

1:20:31.627 --> 1:20:32.893
They called me.

1:20:32.895 --> 1:20:34.929
They don't want me
to do it anymore.

1:20:34.931 --> 1:20:37.431
They're gonna get the
phys ed guy to coach now.

1:20:37.433 --> 1:20:38.966
He don't even know those kids.

1:20:38.968 --> 1:20:42.069
He coaches girls' volleyball
and now he's gonna coach

1:20:42.071 --> 1:20:43.571
my team!

1:20:46.042 --> 1:20:48.175
- You're still the Mayor, Rob.

1:20:51.080 --> 1:20:53.881
- The kids are gonna
read this shit.

1:20:56.986 --> 1:20:59.486
I didn't do bad things.

1:20:59.488 --> 1:21:01.288
I just want to make things good.

1:21:01.290 --> 1:21:04.859
You know, I go and I meet
everyone and I help 'em.

1:21:04.861 --> 1:21:06.327
I don't care what.

1:21:06.329 --> 1:21:08.896
Yeah, but they just
wanna get me.

1:21:08.898 --> 1:21:10.931
(breathing heavily)

1:21:12.735 --> 1:21:15.002
You don't think it'll
be forever, do you?

1:21:15.004 --> 1:21:17.638
Just, like a suspension,
more of?

1:21:18.708 --> 1:21:20.407
- The coaching?

1:21:21.844 --> 1:21:23.611
I think if there's no
video then nothing's--

1:21:23.613 --> 1:21:25.446
- No, there's no video!

1:21:25.448 --> 1:21:27.147
I swear, there's none.

1:21:28.384 --> 1:21:30.618
I was just hanging out
with the kids.

1:21:30.620 --> 1:21:32.620
You know, we were
just hanging out.

1:21:32.622 --> 1:21:34.321
Like regular, you know?

1:21:37.226 --> 1:21:39.827
- But there's no video,
though, Rob, right?

1:21:40.096 --> 1:21:43.364
- Yeah, but they always
just want to get something.

1:21:44.767 --> 1:21:46.533
And they're always
on their phone.

1:21:46.535 --> 1:21:50.070
And I know they're there
and I know they're doing shit.

1:21:50.373 --> 1:21:53.807
Sometimes I leave here
and there's a cop car

1:21:53.809 --> 1:21:56.043
and I swear that I know
that it's the same--

1:21:56.045 --> 1:21:58.579
I get home and
it's the same car,

1:21:58.581 --> 1:22:00.047
just driving around.

1:22:00.049 --> 1:22:01.582
You know, like it's looking
for somethin',

1:22:01.584 --> 1:22:04.585
or trying to put somethin'
there -- plantin', like.

1:22:04.587 --> 1:22:06.287
(heavy breathing)

1:22:07.089 --> 1:22:08.689
There's a game tonight.

1:22:08.691 --> 1:22:10.090
I want you to give me
their numbers.

1:22:10.092 --> 1:22:12.026
We'll order pizza and then

1:22:12.028 --> 1:22:13.460
I'll tell them all
to come over here

1:22:13.462 --> 1:22:14.228
after their game.

1:22:14.230 --> 1:22:15.529
- I think we gotta wait, Rob.

1:22:15.531 --> 1:22:17.364
- No. I wanna eat pizza

1:22:17.366 --> 1:22:18.966
and I wanna eat pizza
with the kids.

1:22:18.968 --> 1:22:20.367
- Rob, I don't think
that's a good--

1:22:20.369 --> 1:22:23.470
- You're not the fuckin' boss!
I'm the boss!

1:22:25.474 --> 1:22:27.708
You find the numbers
and you write 'em down.

1:22:27.710 --> 1:22:29.376
You just do that!

1:22:29.378 --> 1:22:31.045
You think it's a
fucking math test?

1:22:31.047 --> 1:22:32.947
It's not math numbers!

1:22:33.349 --> 1:22:35.049
(heavy breathing)

1:22:37.653 --> 1:22:39.353
- Okay.

1:22:41.123 --> 1:22:43.290
I'll get the numbers,
but then I'm gonna go.

1:22:43.292 --> 1:22:45.059
- What? No.

1:22:45.061 --> 1:22:47.795
No! No, don't leave, Kamal.

1:22:47.797 --> 1:22:49.496
No.

1:22:49.665 --> 1:22:51.131
No. All right, all right;

1:22:51.133 --> 1:22:53.600
we'll just take a break and
we'll come back in a little.

1:22:53.602 --> 1:22:55.536
All right? I love ya'.

1:22:55.538 --> 1:22:57.237
I love ya', Kamal.

1:22:58.074 --> 1:22:59.974
You're my friend.

1:23:00.710 --> 1:23:03.143
I'm sorry, okay?

1:23:03.813 --> 1:23:05.512
Okay?

1:23:05.848 --> 1:23:09.116
Huh? Okay, so, and then
you can come back after.

1:23:13.255 --> 1:23:15.789
- Remember that night?
Here with your friends?

1:23:15.791 --> 1:23:16.857
- Huh?

1:23:16.859 --> 1:23:18.025
- You yelled something
to Ashley.

1:23:18.027 --> 1:23:19.560
And I was here
the next day--

1:23:19.562 --> 1:23:20.961
- Who?

1:23:20.963 --> 1:23:23.063
Who? No, no. I don't remember.

1:23:23.065 --> 1:23:24.732
- You did, Rob.

1:23:24.734 --> 1:23:27.167
- You know, well, you know,
I was--

1:23:27.169 --> 1:23:29.303
I was having a good time.
I, uh...

1:23:29.305 --> 1:23:31.705
You know, I was a little
out of control that night.

1:23:31.707 --> 1:23:34.775
I was. I know. I'm not arguing.

1:23:37.380 --> 1:23:38.312
- I'm gonna go...

1:23:38.314 --> 1:23:39.947
- So go!!

1:23:39.949 --> 1:23:43.217
I'm on my knees, but
I'm not a fucking cunt.

1:23:44.587 --> 1:23:46.320
I'm not begging for ya'.

1:23:46.322 --> 1:23:47.955
Go!

1:23:47.957 --> 1:23:49.656
I'll order pizza! Easy.

1:24:03.606 --> 1:24:05.305
- You know, Rob,

1:24:06.075 --> 1:24:08.342
I love that you answer
everyone's call

1:24:08.344 --> 1:24:10.277
and that you see everyone
that needs something

1:24:10.279 --> 1:24:14.048
and that you like to have
a good time when you're out.

1:24:14.250 --> 1:24:17.184
I thought that'd be
a cool guy to work for.

1:24:17.186 --> 1:24:18.852
That's a good mayor.

1:24:18.854 --> 1:24:21.889
But, if you're drunk enough
you don't know you harassed

1:24:21.891 --> 1:24:23.557
one of your own--

1:24:23.559 --> 1:24:26.060
- If you're done, I have
another Kamal comin'.

1:24:26.062 --> 1:24:27.728
No problem, buddy.

1:24:29.231 --> 1:24:30.731
Get out!

1:24:51.087 --> 1:24:52.586
- It's on here.

1:24:52.588 --> 1:24:56.390
I can't tell you how I got it,
but it's... But it's there.

1:24:56.392 --> 1:24:58.525
- We tapped the guy's phones.

1:24:58.994 --> 1:25:00.160
- Rob's?

1:25:00.162 --> 1:25:01.862
- The video guy.

1:25:02.631 --> 1:25:03.931
- He in trouble?

1:25:03.933 --> 1:25:05.532
- Yeah, we can't say.

1:25:05.534 --> 1:25:07.301
- But, yeah.

1:25:15.111 --> 1:25:16.743
- Is he gonna lose his job?

1:25:16.745 --> 1:25:18.445
- He's the mayor.

1:25:19.949 --> 1:25:22.316
- Is that a yes or no?

1:25:29.024 --> 1:25:30.724
- Am I in trouble?

1:25:31.427 --> 1:25:32.826
- No.

1:25:32.828 --> 1:25:34.328
It wasn't illegal, what you did.

1:25:34.330 --> 1:25:36.230
Stupid, but not illegal.

1:25:37.199 --> 1:25:39.333
We're just trying to figure out
how to get your boss

1:25:39.335 --> 1:25:42.102
her money back, is all. But...

1:25:42.104 --> 1:25:44.138
Yeah. You're fine.

1:25:44.140 --> 1:25:46.106
- But your judgment was just

1:25:46.108 --> 1:25:47.508
way, way off.

1:25:47.510 --> 1:25:51.245
I don't see how we can
continue with you from here.

1:25:51.714 --> 1:25:53.413
- Wait, like...

1:25:53.849 --> 1:25:55.549
Like, at all?

1:25:58.254 --> 1:26:00.621
- I like you, Bram. Mostly.

1:26:00.823 --> 1:26:03.757
But, you know, this was just--

1:26:03.759 --> 1:26:05.659
- You're firing me?

1:26:05.895 --> 1:26:07.828
- We're not renewing
your contract.

1:26:08.898 --> 1:26:10.597
- But you--

1:26:12.768 --> 1:26:14.801
You guys gave the go ahead.

1:26:20.576 --> 1:26:23.677
- All you had to do was show up
and do what you were asked.

1:26:23.679 --> 1:26:26.079
Show up, shut up, head down.
That's all a kid like you

1:26:26.081 --> 1:26:28.148
has to know, has to do.

1:26:28.150 --> 1:26:31.418
You think I'm sitting
on this side of the desk

1:26:32.855 --> 1:26:34.354
because I showed up?

1:26:34.356 --> 1:26:37.424
You think everybody who wanted
to work here knew somebody?

1:26:38.060 --> 1:26:40.194
That's your chance.

1:26:40.196 --> 1:26:43.263
So, no, you don't get another
until you earn it.

1:26:43.532 --> 1:26:46.900
Maybe I should've thought
longer before trusting

1:26:46.902 --> 1:26:50.671
someone so green, or maybe you
took too big a bite.

1:26:50.673 --> 1:26:52.339
I don't know. But...

1:26:53.542 --> 1:26:55.242
I think:

1:26:55.244 --> 1:26:58.212
maybe you're just not
a very good journalist.

1:27:12.995 --> 1:27:14.695
(busy office atmosphere)

1:27:54.136 --> 1:27:56.303
- Bram? Come on back.

1:27:58.874 --> 1:28:00.574
Hey.

1:28:07.883 --> 1:28:10.050
- I banged your pussy.

1:28:15.124 --> 1:28:17.724
- Are you sure
that's what he said?

1:28:20.863 --> 1:28:23.897
- But you had been drinking
that night, correct?

1:28:24.667 --> 1:28:25.832
- What?

1:28:25.834 --> 1:28:27.267
- Ah, I was just, um...

1:28:27.269 --> 1:28:29.970
I know that sometimes
if I have a drink or two,

1:28:29.972 --> 1:28:32.205
I'll remember different.
I just...

1:28:32.941 --> 1:28:36.543
Are you sure you're remembering
exactly what happened?

1:28:38.213 --> 1:28:39.913
- Yes.

1:28:40.582 --> 1:28:43.016
And even though I had a beer
before coming here,

1:28:43.018 --> 1:28:46.753
I'll also remember that I said
"fuck you" to a police officer

1:28:46.755 --> 1:28:48.755
when you ask me if that
actually happened, too.

1:28:48.757 --> 1:28:49.690
- Look, I--

1:28:49.692 --> 1:28:51.558
- Fuck you!

1:28:56.198 --> 1:28:57.898
Any other questions?

1:28:58.667 --> 1:29:02.669
- I see you were volunteering as
a football coach for a period.

1:29:02.938 --> 1:29:06.373
But, well, were you doing
anything to keep yourself sharp?

1:29:06.375 --> 1:29:08.175
I noticed there's
actually a large gap

1:29:08.177 --> 1:29:10.477
between you're graduating
and now.

1:29:10.479 --> 1:29:12.379
- Uh, I was working.

1:29:13.816 --> 1:29:16.283
- I think I may have
the old version here.

1:29:16.285 --> 1:29:18.885
- Uh, no. No, I was, uh...

1:29:18.887 --> 1:29:20.387
(clears throat)

1:29:21.190 --> 1:29:24.624
I was finding that I wasn't
getting called in for anything,

1:29:24.626 --> 1:29:25.859
so...

1:29:25.861 --> 1:29:29.463
So, I figured if I could
explain my last job in person

1:29:29.465 --> 1:29:31.832
it wouldn't be such a red flag.

1:29:34.303 --> 1:29:36.870
- Dare I ask where
you last worked?

1:29:37.706 --> 1:29:39.973
- I worked in the
mayor's office.

1:29:41.310 --> 1:29:42.876
- Of Toronto?

1:29:44.046 --> 1:29:45.445
- Yes.

1:29:45.881 --> 1:29:48.181
So, before you decide that
anyone who worked there

1:29:48.183 --> 1:29:50.884
must have been a complete moron,
I can explain what I did there

1:29:50.886 --> 1:29:53.420
and how I did it,
how I did my job.

1:29:53.422 --> 1:29:54.955
Which, given the circumstances,

1:29:54.957 --> 1:29:57.758
I think I did pretty
damn well, actually.

1:29:58.694 --> 1:30:01.361
- And what was your
job title there?

1:30:01.363 --> 1:30:03.063
- Officially or unofficially?

1:30:05.134 --> 1:30:06.400
- Officially.

1:30:06.402 --> 1:30:08.535
- Special Assistant
to the Mayor.

1:30:10.806 --> 1:30:12.506
- And unofficially?

1:30:14.276 --> 1:30:15.742
- Mayor.

1:30:15.744 --> 1:30:17.110
<i> - FEMALE REPORTER: We are</i>
<i> waiting outside the office--</i>

1:30:17.112 --> 1:30:18.512
<i> Oh! Here's Mayor Ford.</i>

1:30:18.514 --> 1:30:20.947
- I want to call Mayor Britannia
in Hamilton and tell him

1:30:20.949 --> 1:30:23.450
we're gonna have to spank
the little Tiger Cats.

1:30:23.452 --> 1:30:26.119
Oh! And the last thing:
Ashley Pollack.

1:30:26.121 --> 1:30:29.556
It says she says I wanted to eat
her pussy, Ashley Pollack.

1:30:29.558 --> 1:30:32.659
I've never said that in my life
to her, I would never do that.

1:30:32.661 --> 1:30:35.462
I'm happily married. I've got
more than enough to eat at home.

1:30:35.464 --> 1:30:36.963
Thank you very much.

1:30:36.965 --> 1:30:38.348

(laughter)

1:31:14.369 --> 1:31:17.370
- Okay, so, other than
sort of knowing Deb,

1:31:17.372 --> 1:31:18.705
what should I know about you?

1:31:18.707 --> 1:31:20.807
- Uh, well I went to
Western for undergrad and...

1:31:20.809 --> 1:31:24.411
- No, no. I got all that.
I read the resume.

1:31:24.413 --> 1:31:26.112
You're a writer.

1:31:28.250 --> 1:31:29.950
Pitch me.

1:31:33.255 --> 1:31:34.721
- Yeah. Um...

1:31:34.723 --> 1:31:37.691
<i> Well, I guess the news</i>
<i> is meant to be divisive now.</i>

1:31:37.693 --> 1:31:38.725

1:31:38.727 --> 1:31:40.293
<i> Anything. You're left,</i>
<i> or right,</i>

1:31:40.295 --> 1:31:41.995
<i> old or young.</i>

1:31:42.931 --> 1:31:44.197
Yeah.

1:31:44.199 --> 1:31:46.233
Yeah, you don't know how many
articles - news articles -

1:31:46.235 --> 1:31:48.902
I have read about how people
my age are lazy and entitled

1:31:48.904 --> 1:31:50.237
and...

1:31:50.239 --> 1:31:51.571
everything that's wrong
with the world.

1:31:51.573 --> 1:31:54.007
Uh, I am not lazy.

1:31:54.009 --> 1:31:56.843
I don't think my friends
are lazy. Um...

1:31:56.845 --> 1:31:59.379
I mean, I spent my
entire life in school

1:31:59.381 --> 1:32:01.348
trying to be the best one in the
class because that's what they

1:32:01.350 --> 1:32:04.117
told us to do and, so, I did.

1:32:04.119 --> 1:32:07.420
I, uh, I did every program that
my parents signed me up for.

1:32:07.422 --> 1:32:08.855
Um...

1:32:08.857 --> 1:32:12.225
You know, hockey on Mondays
and guitar on Tuesdays,

1:32:12.227 --> 1:32:13.627
karate on Wednesdays,

1:32:13.629 --> 1:32:15.161
hockey on Thursday
mornings again.

1:32:15.163 --> 1:32:17.931
Uh... A math tutor that night.
Playdate, playdate, playdate.

1:32:17.933 --> 1:32:21.401
We were, um, bred
to be doing stuff.

1:32:22.137 --> 1:32:24.604
Constantly, with-with
everyone else. And, so...

1:32:24.606 --> 1:32:27.741
<i> If I get bored easily,</i>
<i> yeah, I mean,</i>

1:32:27.743 --> 1:32:30.477
<i>I-I had a busier social calendar</i>
<i> before the age of 11</i>

1:32:30.479 --> 1:32:32.746
<i> than most heads-of-state do.</i>
<i> So...</i>

1:32:32.748 --> 1:32:35.815
<i> So, no. I do not really.</i>
<i>I-I don't get the "lazy" thing.</i>

1:32:36.118 --> 1:32:38.718
You know, we-we-we've been
constantly stimulated

1:32:38.720 --> 1:32:40.453
since the moment our mothers
realized that something

1:32:40.455 --> 1:32:41.821
was growing in them.

1:32:41.823 --> 1:32:43.557
Before they even bought
the pee sticks,

1:32:43.559 --> 1:32:45.091
they went to the CD store

1:32:45.093 --> 1:32:47.861
so they could blast classical
music into their wombs, so...

1:32:47.863 --> 1:32:49.696
You know, you'll have to
forgive me if, once in a while,

1:32:49.698 --> 1:32:52.098
I don't know what to do with
myself, so I play on my phone.

1:32:52.100 --> 1:32:53.366
Um...

1:32:53.368 --> 1:32:55.068
And...

1:32:55.470 --> 1:32:57.137
<i> Uh, entitled?</i>

1:32:57.139 --> 1:32:59.372
<i> Uh, you get annoyed because</i>

1:32:59.374 --> 1:33:01.575
<i> we got participation ribbons</i>
<i> for everything, you know,</i>

1:33:01.577 --> 1:33:03.476
<i> even if we didn't win. But...</i>

1:33:03.478 --> 1:33:05.178
But isn't that

1:33:05.547 --> 1:33:07.514
pretty great, though? I mean...

1:33:07.516 --> 1:33:09.516
You know, am I entitled? Yes.

1:33:09.518 --> 1:33:11.885
Yeah, I am. You know,
I want things.

1:33:11.887 --> 1:33:14.254
I think that I deserve things.
But I, you know I know that

1:33:14.256 --> 1:33:17.357
I have to work hard for the
stuff that I want. I'm not...

1:33:17.359 --> 1:33:19.492
I'm not an idiot. Um...

1:33:19.494 --> 1:33:22.429
I'll never be able
to afford a house, but...

1:33:22.431 --> 1:33:23.830
But I want one.

1:33:23.831 --> 1:33:25.230
You know, I don't-- I'm not sure
that I can get married

1:33:25.233 --> 1:33:28.401
any time soon, but I-I-I
would like to, I guess.

1:33:28.403 --> 1:33:29.869
Um,

1:33:29.871 --> 1:33:32.339
you know, I'd just be happy
to buy a car at this point.

1:33:32.341 --> 1:33:33.607
And, I mean,

1:33:33.609 --> 1:33:35.008
there's-there's the
constant pressure

1:33:35.010 --> 1:33:37.043
to just do all that stuff
already from-from the

1:33:37.045 --> 1:33:40.113
<i> people that bought houses</i>
<i> and-and got married and stuff</i>

1:33:40.115 --> 1:33:41.615
<i> when they were 22.</i>

1:33:41.617 --> 1:33:45.051
<i> And, then, elected people</i>
<i> that are gonna screw us</i>

1:33:45.053 --> 1:33:47.087
<i> for the next 50 years.</i>

1:33:47.088 --> 1:33:49.122
<i> I mean if we haven't</i>
<i> destroyed the earth by then.</i>

1:33:49.124 --> 1:33:52.058
<i> Yes, I-I think that, uh,</i>
<i> participation ribbons</i>

1:33:52.060 --> 1:33:54.127
are-are really great.

1:33:54.129 --> 1:33:57.998
Actually, I-I, you know, I don't
have to be the best! I wanna be.

1:33:58.000 --> 1:33:59.833
I do! I wanna be the best,
but I...

1:33:59.835 --> 1:34:01.968
But if I'm not, I don't--

1:34:02.671 --> 1:34:05.438
I think I should still
be able to participate.

1:34:05.440 --> 1:34:06.840
You know? I-I...

1:34:06.842 --> 1:34:09.476
To-to-to do something
that I love, or...

1:34:09.978 --> 1:34:12.445
be a part of something,
or, at least

1:34:12.447 --> 1:34:14.347
just get paid for it, you know?

1:34:14.349 --> 1:34:16.149
I-I want to participate,
so, yes!

1:34:16.151 --> 1:34:19.419
I would, yes, I would like
my fucking participation ribbon.

1:34:21.923 --> 1:34:25.191
I'm sorry that I...
That I swore just now.

1:34:27.429 --> 1:34:29.129
- WOMAN 4: Bram?

1:34:29.131 --> 1:34:30.830
Sorry for the wait.

1:34:44.312 --> 1:34:45.378
- Let me show you around.

1:34:48.450 --> 1:34:49.516
- Yeah.

1:34:57.192 --> 1:34:58.892

1:38:20.829 --> 1:38:22.896
