a cheeky little trollop you are.

The nearest land is...

What, 600 miles, Captain?

16:23.941 --> 16:25.316

flattering photograph, is it?

robbery, forgery.

And attempted murder.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.383

not very good at what you do.

No need for that.

- No, no. That's nonsense.

01:02:21.028 --> 01:02:23.864
- I'm glad you're so impressed.
- Shit!

01:02:24.323 --> 01:02:25.949
- There's no way out
through this door.

01:02:25.992 --> 01:02:27.409
- It's buckled right
to the frame.

01:02:27.452 --> 01:02:28.910
- We can't go back
the way we came.

01:02:28.953 --> 01:02:31.538
- Okay, Canton, it's your ship.
Any ideas?

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:33.957
There are more hatchways and
stairwells on the other side

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.375
of this wall.

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:38.044
The only way outta here
is down those steps.

[Beeps]

01:02:45.344 --> 01:02:48.096
- He's right.
- How far?

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:50.557
[Beeps]
[Sighs] It's 20 metres.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.392
- Somebody's gonna
have to go and check.

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:54.102
- I volunteer to wait here.

01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:56.938
- Me too.
- No way.

01:02:57.607 --> 01:03:01.526
I'll go. But you're
comin' with me.

01:03:01.986 --> 01:03:03.445
[Chuckles]
Good luck.

01:03:03.488 --> 01:03:05.739
- And what are we
laughing at? Hmm?

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:08.074
If we make it through,
I'll fire two rounds.

01:03:08.117 --> 01:03:10.494
- That means it's safe
to come through.

01:03:10.536 --> 01:03:14.206
- Okay. Hey! It's mine.

01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:18.960
Let's give the lady
a real gun, shall we?

01:03:25.009 --> 01:03:26.802
You know how
to use that?

01:03:26.844 --> 01:03:29.179
Yeah. If something comes at me,
I'll just pull the trigger

01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:31.306
'til it goes away.

01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:33.767
Careful with that.
It's got a hell of a kick.

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.769
I can handle it.

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:38.313
Well, if we're goin'
for a swim,

01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:41.608
I think it's your turn
to carry the parts.

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:48.448
This is turnin' out to be
one hell of a day.

Come on. Up.

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:13.408
- What the hell is takin' 'em?
- You know, uh,

01:05:14.201 --> 01:05:17.162
I don't mean
to sound like a pussy,

01:05:17.204 --> 01:05:20.206
but this shit is startin'
to freak me out, man!

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:26.129
[Gasping]

01:05:27.048 --> 01:05:30.884
Can you just get asthma?

01:05:31.928 --> 01:05:34.012
Or do you have to be
born with it?

- Where's Mason?
- It got him.

01:08:17.384 --> 01:08:20.220
- Shit! Not Mason!
- Grabbed him.

01:08:20.261 --> 01:08:21.930
[Mulligan]
No way this is happening!

01:08:21.971 --> 01:08:23.640
This isn't bloody happening!

01:08:23.682 --> 01:08:26.100
- Who's next?
- Now where do we go?

01:08:26.143 --> 01:08:29.020
There are more elevators through
that hatchway over there.

01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:31.231
I ain't goin' up in no
more elevators, man.

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:32.774
I agree with these gentlemen.

01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:34.567
How much longer before
we can expect a rescue?

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:36.444
- I'm not waitin' on
any rescue party.

01:08:36.487 --> 01:08:38.321
- We checked in just
before sunset.

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:41.198
It'll be another 24 hours before
they start searching for us.

01:08:41.242 --> 01:08:43.033
Are you saying they're not
even gonna start looking

01:08:43.077 --> 01:08:44.786
for this ship for
another day or two?

01:08:44.828 --> 01:08:46.955
- Be a bit late by then, folks.

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:49.082
And we got creepy crawlies
swarmin' all over,

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:51.167
killin' us off left and right.

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:54.254
Makes for a bit of a tight jam,
don't you think?

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:55.921
I say we stay right here!

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:59.259
- Are you insane?
- No. No, man. He's right.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:00.635
There's plenty of food here.

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:02.261
We can hold out until
they rescue us.

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:03.680
They're right.

01:09:03.721 --> 01:09:05.014
This is the galley
for the crew.

01:09:05.057 --> 01:09:06.307
It was built to be almost
entirely airtight

01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:07.559
in case of fire.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.852
With these hatches closed,
there's no way those things

01:09:08.894 --> 01:09:10.103
can get in here.

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:12.020
You wanna wind up in jail,
Mulligan?

01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:13.939
Better that than in the belly
of one of those things.

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:15.733
I don't care what you do, but
I'm gonna keep on goin'.

01:09:15.776 --> 01:09:17.026
It's our only chance.

01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:18.444
Back off!

01:09:18.487 --> 01:09:19.988
They're wiping us
out one at a time.

01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:23.158
I say we make a stand.
Right here, right now.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.410
The whole damn
ship's infested, Finnegan.

01:09:25.452 --> 01:09:27.703
We're not gonna make it
back to the boat anyways.

01:09:27.746 --> 01:09:30.290
I'm not stayin' down here,
and that's a fact.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:33.126
- Now, back off that hatch.
- I'll do it.

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:35.837
I'll do it.
I swear to God, I'll kill you.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.671
- I'm not mucking about here.
- Whoa, whoa.

01:09:37.715 --> 01:09:39.131
- Don't get hasty, man.

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:40.550
- We're not staying
here, Mulligan!

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:43.970
- I say we are!
[Weapons Cocking]

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:45.721
Last stand, eh?

01:09:45.764 --> 01:09:47.890
[Mulligan]
We'll kick ass and take names.

01:09:47.933 --> 01:09:51.227
You back off right now,
soldier,

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:54.355
before I put you down.

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:05.074
I once saw a guy
put a fish in a bottle.

01:10:05.117 --> 01:10:07.827
And then he corked it
and sealed it tight...

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:10.830
and threw it
to a baby octopus.

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:15.668
Now, the octopus, he felt his
way all around that bottle.

01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:20.006
And in less than two minutes,
he got the cork off,

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:24.135
slid inside,
and ate the fish.

01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:29.682
And the moral
of this story is?

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:32.644
We're the fish.

01:10:33.729 --> 01:10:35.480
Listen.

01:10:35.522 --> 01:10:37.690
The ship's already
starting to sink.

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:39.776
What if they don't
get here in time?

01:10:39.818 --> 01:10:41.402
[Trillian]
I-I don't want to drown.

01:10:41.445 --> 01:10:42.862
[Pantucci]
Yeah.

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:45.406
Look, Mulligan,
you can do whatever you want,

01:10:45.449 --> 01:10:48.368
but I am gonna
get my ass to the surface,

01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:50.870
pray to God that my boat
is still there...

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:53.289
and those things
aren't crawlin' all over it,

01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:56.960
and then I am gonna
bail the hell outta here.

01:10:57.503 --> 01:11:00.171
[Panting]

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:11.683

[Canton Whimpering]
- Shit!

01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:33.514
They're closin' the
damn hatches, man!

01:12:33.557 --> 01:12:36.517
They're closin' the hatches!

01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:44.942
They're herding us!

01:12:44.985 --> 01:12:46.402
They're forcin' us to go
where they want us to go.

01:12:46.445 --> 01:12:47.779
Wait, wait.

01:12:47.821 --> 01:12:49.155
Now you're tellin' me
these things can think?

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:52.325
They're pushing us
toward the bow of the ship.

01:12:55.245 --> 01:12:58.498
What the hell is
at the bow of the ship?

01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:24.565
- Which way?

01:13:24.608 --> 01:13:26.025
- This just takes us
back into the hold.

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:28.653
That's the way up,
through there.

What the hell is this?

01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:37.263
Looks like some kind
of feeding ground.

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:41.058
Looks like
a dead end to me.

- Open up, you bastard!

Hey, give me one of those!

parts to my boat!

Hey, guys!

Joey!

[Blowing Water]
- Joey!

01:37:05.110 --> 01:37:07.779
- Joey!
- Are you all right?

01:37:07.822 --> 01:37:10.865
Hey! Hey! Watch the leg!
W-Watch the leg!

01:37:10.908 --> 01:37:12.283
- Watch the leg!

01:37:12.326 --> 01:37:13.743
- I thought you
said he was dead.

01:37:13.786 --> 01:37:17.288
- I thought he was dead!
- It-It almost had me, man.

01:37:17.331 --> 01:37:19.791
It came crashin' right
through the windshield.

01:37:19.834 --> 01:37:21.292
I ran out the hatch.

01:37:21.335 --> 01:37:22.752
The thing was
snappin' at my ass.

01:37:25.339 --> 01:37:27.590

Next thing I know,
kabloowie.

01:37:33.097 --> 01:37:35.807
And your damn surfboard
almost cut me in half, man.

[Laughing]

01:37:38.018 --> 01:37:39.978
Hey, was it the water
in my eyes,

01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:43.273
or did I just see a little
lip action between you two?

01:37:43.315 --> 01:37:44.649
- Joey...

01:37:44.692 --> 01:37:46.192
- You know, I could always go
for a stroll down the beach...

01:37:46.235 --> 01:37:48.069
- Joey.
- Or go for a little swim.

01:37:48.112 --> 01:37:49.529
- Although I gotta tell you,
if I never get back

01:37:49.572 --> 01:37:50.905
in that damn water again...

01:37:50.948 --> 01:37:52.240
- Joey!

01:37:52.283 --> 01:37:56.744
Okay, cool. I'll stick around.
You don't have to beg me.

01:38:01.959 --> 01:38:05.503
This looks like
a nice enough place.
