00:35.636 --> 00:38.270
Okay, everybody,
we have a new mystery.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.005
What the hell is this?

00:40.007 --> 00:42.441
-MARQUESS: Is that Chinese?
-Is it, Yung?

00:42.443 --> 00:44.977
-Why would I know?
-Because you're Korean.

00:45.345 --> 00:46.545
Okay.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.614
MIKE: Which is
a kind of Chinese.

00:48.616 --> 00:49.548
No.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.250
Oh, Yung,
sometimes I wonder

00:51.252 --> 00:53.652
if homeschooling you
was a big mistake.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.320
Yeah, I've told you it was.

00:55.322 --> 00:57.089
"My name is Wang Jing

00:57.091 --> 00:59.625
"and I want you to
come to Nicaragua
and help me construct

00:59.627 --> 01:02.227
"the largest canal
in the world."

01:02.229 --> 01:03.896
You speak Chinese?

01:03.898 --> 01:06.198
There's a bunch of stuff
you guys don't know about me.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.866
Do you even know my name?

01:08.735 --> 01:09.835
Pigeon.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.103
PIGEON: Richard.

01:11.105 --> 01:12.538
Richard sounds like pigeon.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.473
PIGEON: Oh, man,
what's the point?

01:14.475 --> 01:16.442
Dad, I've heard about this
Nicaragua canal thing.

01:16.444 --> 01:17.976
It's crazy!

01:17.978 --> 01:20.012
It would be three times
as long as the Panama Canal.

01:20.014 --> 01:21.713
And from what I understand,

01:21.715 --> 01:23.549
building it
would be catastrophic
for the environment,

01:23.551 --> 01:25.217
and financially,
it makes no sense.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.519
Where did you hear about that?
It wasn't on my curriculum.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.788
Marquess got me a subscription
to <i> The Economist.</i>

01:29.790 --> 01:31.490
Uh, well, I...
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

01:31.492 --> 01:33.659
I also got you a subscription
to <i> Marie Claire,</i>

01:33.661 --> 01:35.661
and I'd like to see
you pick it up
once in a while.

01:35.663 --> 01:37.996
They have great hair
and makeup tips.

01:37.998 --> 01:39.298
I mean, you...

01:39.300 --> 01:40.799
You've got the inner
beauty thing down,

01:40.801 --> 01:43.235
but let's not forget
what's going on out front.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.437
Dad, you seriously shouldn't
get involved with this.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.406
I have to, honey.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.708
Dad, what are you...
(SIGHS)

01:49.710 --> 01:53.479
You see,
the Nicaraguan canal
has a dream,

01:53.481 --> 01:55.614
to defeat the Panama Canal

01:55.616 --> 01:58.050
and be the heavyweight
champion of canals.

01:58.052 --> 02:00.252
I achieved that dream.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.020
Now it's time for me
to give back

02:02.022 --> 02:04.289
and help somebody else
achieve that dream.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.524
Right, Marquess?

02:05.526 --> 02:07.559
See, I think that would
look good on you.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.994
Get some layers going,

02:08.996 --> 02:11.163
so it's not so much like
you... You just gave up.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.297
MIKE: Come on, gang.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.233
To the Mystery Airline.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.434
You bought a plane?

02:15.436 --> 02:17.436
Don't be stupid,
I can't afford a plane.

02:17.438 --> 02:19.471
But I got a shitload
of miles on Delta.

02:23.009 --> 02:24.977
MIKE: Okay,
let's find Wang Jing

02:24.979 --> 02:27.880
and help him build
the largest canal
in the world.

02:27.882 --> 02:30.649
Then we need to be
in Nicaragua.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.185
Yeah. 'Cause the note
was in Chinese,

02:33.187 --> 02:35.721
but the canal
is in Nicaragua.

02:35.723 --> 02:38.991
Well, in that case,
back to the Mystery Airline.

02:38.993 --> 02:41.793
But it won't be Delta,
because I used up all
my miles on Delta.

02:41.795 --> 02:46.765
Yung Hee, I'll give you
an extra minute to say
goodbye to your homeland.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.072
PIGEON: Well, what fun!

02:54.074 --> 02:56.141
To be on a plane that long.

02:57.477 --> 03:01.647
Welcome to Nicaragua,
my friends.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.682
-(LAUGHING)
-Wang Jing?

03:03.684 --> 03:06.285
Wang Jing indeed,
at your service.

03:06.287 --> 03:10.489
Although, in truth, I hope
you will be at mine. (LAUGHS)

03:10.491 --> 03:12.291
As you can see from the model,

03:12.293 --> 03:14.293
we have much work to do.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.827
Hey, that's a good model.

03:15.829 --> 03:19.064
It looks like a toy train
model, just with no train.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.166
Yes, it is a good model.

03:21.168 --> 03:24.536
I wish it was as easy
to build the real thing

03:24.538 --> 03:26.638
as it was the model.
(LAUGHING)

03:26.640 --> 03:28.607
Jesus Christ! What's this guy
keep laughing about?

03:28.609 --> 03:32.377
But in the model
there are no indigenous
people trying to stop us!

03:32.379 --> 03:35.981
The indigenous people
don't wanna have the biggest
canal in the world?

03:35.983 --> 03:38.817
Ah, but they are too primitive
to understand

03:38.819 --> 03:41.453
that the canal will help them.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.322
GDP will rise

03:43.324 --> 03:47.859
and with it the ability
to feed, clothe
and educate the poor.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.062
-No way he followed
any of that.
-Shh.

03:50.064 --> 03:51.930
WANG: Which is where
you come in.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.398
Oh, you got
a little doll of me.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.167
I want you to travel upriver.

03:55.169 --> 03:56.535
MIKE: Put him in the boat.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.337
Deep into the heart
of darkness

03:58.339 --> 04:01.139
or "jungle,"

04:01.141 --> 04:02.841
and make them understand.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.143
That's a good use
of my skillset.

04:05.145 --> 04:06.511
Ah, excuse me,

04:06.513 --> 04:07.913
but what if doesn't help 'em?

04:07.915 --> 04:09.748
And, because of
global warming,

04:09.750 --> 04:12.017
ships will soon be able to
pass through the Arctic Circle

04:12.019 --> 04:14.553
which will make
all of this pointless.

04:14.555 --> 04:15.988
Of course, you'll be rich
either way,

04:15.990 --> 04:17.756
'cause your company will own
most of Nicaragua.

04:17.758 --> 04:23.228
Hmm. You are obviously
a well-educated young lady.

04:23.230 --> 04:24.396
Huh. (CHUCKLING)

04:24.398 --> 04:25.831
I homeschooled that shit!

04:25.833 --> 04:28.667
But I'm afraid you don't
know everything.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.636
Everybody always wants to
blame the teacher.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.237
Sometimes it's the student.

04:32.239 --> 04:35.240
I'm sorry, but you cannot make
a souffle out of garbage.

04:35.242 --> 04:36.475

Um, I don't speak Chinese.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.653
It's nothing to
brag about, Yung.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.755
I think what he's saying is...

04:49.757 --> 04:51.823
Dad, why do you keep...
(SIGHS)

04:52.759 --> 04:54.826
Maybe no ships will use it,

04:54.828 --> 04:56.862
maybe it will destroy
the environment

04:56.864 --> 04:58.463
and bankrupt the country.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.532
And they could take away
the expensive cars,

05:00.534 --> 05:02.534
and the houses,
and the pretty girls,

05:02.536 --> 05:04.403
but they can never
take away your title.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.004
Well, um, technically,

05:06.006 --> 05:08.640
a title can be taken away
for a multitude of reasons.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.076
Okay, that's true.
Good point, Marquess.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.344
Point for you.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.146
But you get a point taken away
for being a dick.

05:14.148 --> 05:16.114
So, back to zero.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.317
-Okay, we'll do it, Wang Jing.
-Oh!

05:18.319 --> 05:22.154
Those indigenous people
may not like the idea
of the canal now...

05:24.991 --> 05:26.625
Yes?

05:26.627 --> 05:30.095
-What?
-They may not like the idea
of the canal now, but what?

05:30.097 --> 05:33.065
-But what, what?
-What are you talking about?

05:33.067 --> 05:35.467
Ugh!
It's this language barrier.

05:35.469 --> 05:39.271
Yung, tell Wang to take us
to the indigenous people.

05:39.273 --> 05:41.673
Will you take us
to the indigenous people?

05:41.675 --> 05:43.008
Of course.

05:43.643 --> 05:44.810
What did he say?

05:44.812 --> 05:47.312
He said, "Of course."

05:47.314 --> 05:51.183
I think this guy needs
to be homeschooled.
Tell him I said that.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.585
No, no, no. I'm just joking.
Don't tell him I said that.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.020

06:02.028 --> 06:05.464
Damn! Not far from here is
where I first met Sandra.

06:05.466 --> 06:08.734
If only I'd known then that
one day I would betray her

06:08.736 --> 06:11.536
and then in her hurt and anger
she would turn me
into a pigeon.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.873
Because unbeknownst to me,
she secretly
practiced witchcraft.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.343
You know, I probably never
would have come down
here in the first place.

06:18.345 --> 06:19.845
Did you use to live in Mexico?

06:19.847 --> 06:21.346
We're in Nicaragua.

if you don't mind,
I'm talking to Pigeon.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.820
You know, man,
I gotta get used to this.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.856
He doesn't look like
a Richard, right?
He looks like a pigeon, right?

don't you think?

06:37.097 --> 06:39.331
I'm sorry, but...
But can you just say savages?

06:39.333 --> 06:41.500
I am from a time when
people said things like that.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.268
It was cruel,
but it was faster.

06:43.270 --> 06:45.771
You know, like,
"What is it, the savages?"

No, they don't know
what you're saying.
They don't speak English.

The second they begin
digging that canal.

will be like a zipper.

and then the world.
(SNICKERING)

09:26.567 --> 09:28.166
-Huh, what?
-Oh.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.535
I said soon I will control
Nicaragua and then the world.

09:30.537 --> 09:32.304
You know, as a joke.

09:32.306 --> 09:33.705
(LAUGHING)

09:33.707 --> 09:34.873
It's a weird joke.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.174
(ALARMS BLARING)

09:37.610 --> 09:39.144
(BOTH GRUNTING)

09:40.646 --> 09:43.515
Damn! Instead of the savage
converting the savages,

09:43.517 --> 09:46.251
the savages must have
converted the savage.

09:46.253 --> 09:49.020
The hell with it!
Commence digging.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.028
Dig, dig, dig, dig.
(LAUGHING)

09:57.530 --> 09:59.297
(GRUNTING)

09:59.299 --> 10:01.032
You didn't tell me you were
gonna take out the world's...

10:01.034 --> 10:02.601
(SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)

10:02.603 --> 10:04.536
What are you talking about?

10:04.538 --> 10:06.638
Don't hide behind
that language barrier.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.773
That canal's gonna be
the end of the world.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.042
Ah, that's superstitious
nonsense.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.711
What, did you
never go to school?

10:12.713 --> 10:14.779
(GASPS) I went to homeschool.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.348
-MARQUESS: Mike!
-And I was the teacher.

10:16.350 --> 10:18.450
-MARQUESS: Michael, stop it!
-And class is in session.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.819
-MARQUESS: Michael! Oh!
-And that class is called
(BLEEP) you!

10:20.821 --> 10:22.420
-(RUMBLING)
-PIGEON: Whoa!

10:22.422 --> 10:24.856
-What is that?
-MARQUESS: What's happening?

10:28.394 --> 10:29.594
What is happening?

10:32.064 --> 10:34.432
The earth has a penis!

10:34.434 --> 10:36.034
We're gonna die!

10:37.970 --> 10:39.137
(ALL CLAMORING)

10:39.139 --> 10:40.438
MIKE: Run, moon, run!

10:40.440 --> 10:42.607
MARQUESS: The moon
can't run, Michael.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.412
Yep, been there.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.799
See, now you'll listen to what
I have to say, won't you?

11:07.801 --> 11:09.100
You're gonna listen
now, right?

11:09.102 --> 11:10.335
Because I'm bigger
than you now, right?

11:10.337 --> 11:12.170
And I can kick
you in your face, right?
