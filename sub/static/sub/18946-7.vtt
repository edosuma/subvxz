00:26.100 --> 00:28.100
Lucy?

00:30.100 --> 00:32.100
Lucy?

00:33.100 --> 00:35.099
What?

00:35.100 --> 00:38.099
It's 7:30 and the kids are still asleep.

00:38.100 --> 00:40.100
Isn't it great to wake up naturally?

00:41.100 --> 00:42.099
I don't know. Is it?

00:42.100 --> 00:44.099
You know what this means?

00:44.100 --> 00:47.099
We were right to put Baileys
in their bedtime milk?

00:47.100 --> 00:48.100
No.

00:51.100 --> 00:53.099
Oh!

00:53.100 --> 00:55.099
Permission to come aboard, Captain?

00:55.100 --> 00:57.100
Permission granted.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.899
You'll have to be quick. I've got
three packed lunches to make

01:01.900 --> 01:03.940
and I need to clean that sick
off the booster seat.

01:05.099 --> 01:08.100
Well, you might want to cut
down on the sweet-talking, then(!)

01:13.100 --> 01:15.099
Please tell me you can see them, too.

01:15.100 --> 01:17.099
What are you doing?

01:17.100 --> 01:21.099
Daddy was just tickling Mummy.

01:21.100 --> 01:23.099
What with?

01:23.100 --> 01:26.099
Why don't you go downstairs
and do one of your jigsaws?

01:26.100 --> 01:28.099
Or maybe two jigsaws.

01:28.100 --> 01:29.100
Somebody's dreaming.

01:33.100 --> 01:36.099
And you, whatever you do, don't
eat any of those Haribos

01:36.100 --> 01:38.164
I've hidden in the top cupboard,
just behind the teabags.

01:38.189 --> 01:40.099
 Yes!

01:40.100 --> 01:43.099
Maybe in about five years,
we'll get some privacy back.

01:43.100 --> 01:46.100
Yeah. Unless we've got
more kids by then. Ha!

01:47.100 --> 01:50.099
- What?
- What?

01:50.100 --> 01:52.099
- We have finished, right?
- You're getting quicker at this.

01:52.100 --> 01:55.099
Normally, I can at least
tell when you've started.

01:55.100 --> 01:56.885
I thought we weren't
having any more kids?

01:57.010 --> 01:58.024
- We're not.
- All right.

02:00.100 --> 02:02.099
For now.

02:02.100 --> 02:04.099
Is this some sort
of psychological contraception?

02:04.100 --> 02:07.099
What, like, "Shall I pretend
to be Tom Selleck"?

02:07.100 --> 02:10.100
I was feeling experimental,
and it was Movember.

02:12.100 --> 02:14.223
You are still taking
precautions, aren't you?

02:14.248 --> 02:15.124
You know I am.

02:16.100 --> 02:19.099
Well, I know you're taking A pill.

02:19.100 --> 02:20.099
For all I know, you could be necking

02:20.100 --> 02:22.099
Tic Tacs and mentally
repainting the nursery.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.099
Look, I'm not saying
I definitely do want another,

02:24.100 --> 02:27.099
I just think we should have an open
discussion before we rule it out.

02:27.100 --> 02:29.099
All right, let's have an open discussion.

02:29.100 --> 02:31.099
Good. And then rule it out.

02:31.100 --> 02:33.099
That's not an open discussion, Lee.

02:33.100 --> 02:34.099
An open discussion is an exchange of

02:34.100 --> 02:36.099
ideas where you don't
know how it will end.

02:36.100 --> 02:37.688
The last time I had an open discussion

02:37.713 --> 02:39.924
like that, I ended
up sponsoring a guide dog!

02:41.100 --> 02:42.099
Where are you going?

02:42.100 --> 02:45.099
Oh! Can we discuss this
like adults, please?

02:45.100 --> 02:47.100
No. I'm going for a Haribo.

02:48.100 --> 02:51.099
I bet the kids would like a new
brother or sister.

02:51.100 --> 02:53.099
They'd like a full-sized model Dalek.

02:53.100 --> 02:56.099
No, you'd like that,
and we're not getting one.

02:56.100 --> 02:58.099
Oh, so, that's not open to discussion?

02:58.100 --> 03:02.100
At least when we were trying to make love,
it wouldn't suddenly come up the stairs.

03:09.100 --> 03:12.099
So, she's dead set on having
another one, is she?

03:12.100 --> 03:14.099
She's not dead set,
but she wants to discuss it.

03:14.100 --> 03:17.099
Oh, good God, you ARE in trouble.

03:17.100 --> 03:21.099
In the past few months, Anna and I have
discussed having a new kitchen,

03:21.100 --> 03:24.099
we've discussed a very expensive
private school for Jack

03:24.100 --> 03:28.099
and we've discussed having her parents
over for far too long at Christmas.

03:28.100 --> 03:31.100
And guess which one of us got her own way?

03:33.100 --> 03:35.099
Why are you so against the idea, anyway?

03:35.100 --> 03:38.099
It's all right for you,
with your one kid and your nanny.

03:38.100 --> 03:40.099
The nanny was Anna's idea.

03:40.100 --> 03:42.099
Obviously, we discussed it first.

03:42.100 --> 03:45.099
At least you and Anna still
get to do different things.

03:45.100 --> 03:48.099
Me and Lucy's social life has
been reduced to tedious get-togethers

03:48.100 --> 03:51.100
with tedious parents talking
about tedious children.

03:52.100 --> 03:55.099
You two still coming around tomorrow?

03:55.100 --> 03:57.100
Wild horses couldn't drag me away.

03:58.100 --> 04:01.099
It is possible to get
through this, you know.

04:01.100 --> 04:03.099
Anna and I talk about stuff all the time.

04:03.100 --> 04:06.099
Yeah, and you just said, you
then do what she tells you.

04:06.100 --> 04:09.099
I might give the impression I'm
doing whatever Anna tells me.

04:09.100 --> 04:12.099
Yeah, by very cleverly doing
whatever she tells you.

04:12.100 --> 04:16.099
But sometimes, the trick is getting
her to want the same things

04:16.100 --> 04:18.099
I wanted in the first place.

04:18.100 --> 04:20.099
Go on.

04:20.100 --> 04:23.099
Classic example. Few months
ago, an investment matured,

04:23.100 --> 04:25.099
we decided to blow the money on a treat.

04:25.100 --> 04:29.099
I wanted a classic car, 1969
E-Type Jag convertible.

04:29.100 --> 04:31.657
But she wanted to blow
the money on a five-star

04:31.682 --> 04:33.799
luxury skiing holiday in St Moritz.

04:34.100 --> 04:36.099
But we couldn't afford both.

04:36.100 --> 04:39.099
The harsh choices facing
families in austerity Britain(!)

04:39.100 --> 04:41.099
Like I said, I wanted the car,

04:41.100 --> 04:44.100
but I acted like I wanted
the skiing holiday.

04:48.100 --> 04:50.100
Do you know why?

04:52.100 --> 04:54.100
Because you're absolutely
terrified of her?

04:56.100 --> 05:01.099
Because anything I want,
she automatically doesn't want.

05:01.100 --> 05:06.099
Result? We got the car. Right.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.562
And what's your advice for a marriage

05:07.587 --> 05:09.404
that isn't based
on bitterness and mistrust?

05:12.100 --> 05:15.099
It's the same principle, but more subtle.

05:15.100 --> 05:17.099
It's about planting little seeds.

05:17.100 --> 05:19.100
Or, in your case, not planting any.

05:20.100 --> 05:23.099
You have got to make Lucy change her mind,

05:23.100 --> 05:25.220
but at the same time, make
her think it was her idea.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.099
And how do I do that?

05:28.100 --> 05:31.099
Well, instead of telling
her all the reasons

05:31.100 --> 05:33.099
why having another child
wouldn't suit you,

05:33.100 --> 05:37.099
subtly make her see all the reasons
why it wouldn't suit her.

05:37.100 --> 05:38.099
I see.

05:38.100 --> 05:41.099
Well? I suppose having
another child would mean

05:41.100 --> 05:44.099
that she has less quality
time to spend with me.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.100
Perhaps give that one a bit more thought.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:56.100 --> 05:58.099
Checking for three sixes?

05:58.100 --> 06:01.099
I think he might have head lice.

06:01.100 --> 06:02.099
But, look on the bright side,

06:02.100 --> 06:05.099
if you have it your way, we won't
have to go through all this again.

06:05.100 --> 06:08.099
Charlie, why don't you go upstairs
and flick nits at your sister?

06:08.100 --> 06:09.100
Yay!

06:12.100 --> 06:15.099
Look, um... maybe I was a bit
hasty this morning,

06:15.100 --> 06:18.099
saying, er... no more kids, ever.

06:18.100 --> 06:21.099
I'm not saying I do want more.
No, neither am I.

06:21.100 --> 06:24.099
But I am up for, you know,
an open discussion.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.099
Well, that's all I was asking for.

06:26.100 --> 06:30.100
After all, you've taken five years
out from work, what's another five?

06:35.100 --> 06:37.099
Five?

06:37.100 --> 06:40.099
Well, yeah. With another mouth
to feed, I won't be able to share

06:40.100 --> 06:42.099
the housework, like I did
with the first three.

06:42.100 --> 06:44.099
All right, bad example.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.099
And we're going to need a bigger car.

06:46.100 --> 06:48.099
I've been doing some research
in the magazines. Oh!

06:48.100 --> 06:49.099
Take a look at this one.

06:49.100 --> 06:51.099
Oh, that's lovely!

06:51.100 --> 06:52.099
Oh, sorry, wrong page.

06:52.100 --> 06:54.242
That one's the classic
vintage Jaguar E-Type

06:54.267 --> 06:56.099
convertible that Toby and Anna bought.

06:56.100 --> 06:58.099
I mean this one, in the no-frills section.

06:58.100 --> 07:01.099
Or, as they've called it,
the more-kids-than-sense section.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.100
Huh! Oh, you've got to love Clarkson!

07:05.100 --> 07:08.099
Hm. That looks functional.

07:08.100 --> 07:11.099
What type is it? Ah, whatever.
They're all the same, anyway.

07:11.100 --> 07:14.099
You know, Vauxhall Zafira,
Renault Espace, Nissan Minger.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.099
The point is, they're practical.

07:16.100 --> 07:18.099
Say what you want about sports cars,

07:18.100 --> 07:20.099
but have they got all-plastic interiors

07:20.100 --> 07:22.100
for when you have to hose out the vomit?

07:24.100 --> 07:28.099
Well, like I say,
it's only a discussion at this stage.

07:28.100 --> 07:31.099
'Course it is. I mean, it's easy
for me to say, innit?

07:31.100 --> 07:33.099
I don't have to go through the pregnancy.

07:33.100 --> 07:36.099
OK, yes, there's the morning
sickness and the sore joints

07:36.100 --> 07:38.099
and the mood swings and the tiredness,

07:38.100 --> 07:40.099
and the dehydration and the leg cramps

07:40.100 --> 07:42.099
and the constant stabbing
pain in the pelvic girdle,

07:42.100 --> 07:45.099
and the not wanting to get back
into your bikini after the birth

07:45.100 --> 07:49.099
because of the varicose veins
and the constant big, old bloated feeling.

07:49.100 --> 07:50.260
But look at all the benefits!

07:52.100 --> 07:54.100
Another healthy year of no wine.

07:58.100 --> 07:59.099
You forgot the constipation.

07:59.100 --> 08:02.100
Oh, come on! That'll come
in handy when you're that busy.

08:11.100 --> 08:13.100
Argh! Can't catch me! Yeah, I can!

08:15.100 --> 08:20.099
Quiet, Molly! Anna doesn't
want to hear you screaming!

08:20.100 --> 08:23.099
It's all right, Lucy. You
forget I have a child, too.

08:23.100 --> 08:25.100
I know how to deal with this.

08:29.100 --> 08:31.099
Are you sure you want four children?

08:31.100 --> 08:34.099
I know someone who's giving
away a chinchilla.

08:34.100 --> 08:38.099
Actually, I'm starting to think having more
children isn't such a good idea after all.

08:38.100 --> 08:42.099
Really? Well, the more Lee and I talk
about it, the more I've gone off the idea.

08:42.100 --> 08:46.099
Don't tell me, he's been looking at it
from your point of view?

08:46.100 --> 08:49.099
Talked about how happy
he was to make loads of compromises,

08:49.100 --> 08:52.099
didn't put any pressure on you at all?
Pretty much.

08:52.100 --> 08:54.099
The oldest trick in the book.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.099
Making the case for one thing,

08:56.100 --> 08:58.099
while subtly steering you
in the other direction.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.099
That doesn't sound like Lee.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.700
He was being clever. That's what I mean.

09:03.100 --> 09:06.099
Marriage is a complicated game of chess.

09:06.100 --> 09:08.099
You always have to look five moves ahead.

09:08.100 --> 09:10.099
My marriage isn't like a game of chess,

09:10.100 --> 09:13.100
it's more like throwing
a Frisbee for a dog.

09:15.100 --> 09:17.099
Forget all the discussions and what-ifs,

09:17.100 --> 09:19.099
forget how open Lee was being.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.099
Just ask yourself one simple question.

09:22.100 --> 09:24.100
Might you want another child
in the future?

09:25.100 --> 09:29.099
Well... maybe, yes.

09:29.100 --> 09:31.099
Well, there you go. Simple.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.099
You're right, Anna.

09:33.100 --> 09:35.099
I feel so much clearer
after talking to you.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.099
I'm going to tell Lee.

09:37.100 --> 09:40.099
Don't tell him! My God, you're naive!

09:40.100 --> 09:42.099
You need to manipulate him in return.

09:42.100 --> 09:44.099
Do I? Of course you do.

09:44.100 --> 09:47.099
Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.

09:47.100 --> 09:52.099
Recently, Toby wanted to buy
a sports car, and so did I.

09:52.100 --> 09:53.100
But guess what I did?

09:55.100 --> 09:59.099
I pretended I wanted a skiing
holiday instead. Why?

09:59.100 --> 10:02.099
Because I knew Toby
was trying to manipulate me,

10:02.100 --> 10:04.100
so I manipulated him in return.

10:05.100 --> 10:08.099
I knew he was only pretending
to want the skiing holiday

10:08.100 --> 10:10.099
to make me want the car,
but I already wanted the car,

10:10.100 --> 10:12.100
so I played him at his own game.

10:13.100 --> 10:15.099
That way, it looked like I'd compromised.

10:15.100 --> 10:18.099
And so, next time I want
something, he owes me.

10:18.100 --> 10:21.099
And you've got to manipulate
Lee to get what you want.

10:21.100 --> 10:26.099
Oh, I don't know. All sounds
a bit cold and calculating.

10:26.100 --> 10:28.100
Good. I'm glad I'm making myself clear.

10:38.100 --> 10:42.099
I just saw a very heavily pregnant
woman in the supermarket.

10:42.100 --> 10:46.099
Oh, yeah? Yeah, she looked so happy.
She had that... glow.

10:46.100 --> 10:48.099
Is that right? Yeah.

10:48.100 --> 10:52.099
She'd just knocked over a display with her
pushchair and the kids were running riot,

10:52.100 --> 10:55.099
but she just kept glowing.

10:55.100 --> 10:57.099
I know you used to call
it blotchy-gland rash,

10:57.100 --> 10:59.100
but I call it glowing.

11:01.100 --> 11:03.099
I've been thinking about everything
you've been saying

11:03.100 --> 11:05.099
and I feel bad
about what I'm going to say,

11:05.100 --> 11:06.417
especially given that you've been so

11:06.442 --> 11:08.099
considerate and thoughtful
about everything,

11:08.100 --> 11:13.099
but I've made a decision,
and I feel definite about it.

11:13.100 --> 11:15.099
Go on.

11:15.100 --> 11:17.100
I don't want to have any more children.

11:18.100 --> 11:20.100
Yee-haw!

11:23.100 --> 11:25.100
That's a shame.

11:27.100 --> 11:29.099
I was so full of enthusiasm.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.100
Yes, you were. You were full of it.

11:33.100 --> 11:36.099
You've been very sweet,
but you got me thinking,

11:36.100 --> 11:37.099
do I actually want more time off work?

11:37.100 --> 11:40.099
Do I really want to go
through another pregnancy again?

11:40.100 --> 11:43.099
And I decided, no, I don't.

11:43.100 --> 11:45.099
Are you sure?

11:45.100 --> 11:47.099
Yes, I am.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.099
As in, not ever, for definite?

11:49.100 --> 11:51.099
For definite.

11:51.100 --> 11:53.099
Shall we put it in writing?

11:53.100 --> 11:54.099
Oh, I haven't got time for that.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.207
The kids are at my mum's and you
and me have got

11:56.232 --> 11:58.099
some unfinished business
from this morning.

11:58.100 --> 12:01.099
Ooo! Afternoon delight!

12:01.100 --> 12:03.100
My favourite delight, after Angel.

12:04.100 --> 12:07.099
What's brought this on? Well,
it's a special occasion.

12:07.100 --> 12:08.099
Is it?

12:08.100 --> 12:12.100
Yeah. The last time we make
love before your vasectomy.

12:19.100 --> 12:22.099
My what? You know,
an operation on your genitals

12:22.100 --> 12:25.099
which stops sperm leaving
the body and making you sterile.

12:25.100 --> 12:27.099
No, you're still not selling it.

12:27.100 --> 12:30.099
Well, it's the only way
to make things final,

12:30.100 --> 12:32.099
and the pill has lots
of side-effects, like weight gain,

12:32.100 --> 12:36.099
and I want to look good
in that bikini, remember?

12:36.100 --> 12:38.099
A vasectomy doesn't have any side-effects.

12:38.100 --> 12:42.099
No. Unless you count cutting off half
your genitalia with a big knife!

12:42.100 --> 12:45.099
Lee, it's a vasectomy, not
gender-reassignment surgery.

12:45.100 --> 12:47.099
They don't cut half of anything off.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.099
They take less than a millimetre.

12:49.100 --> 12:52.100
So, what's that, about three-quarters?

12:54.100 --> 12:57.099
We've talked about this in the past.
Have we?

12:57.100 --> 13:00.099
Gosh! We've been talking about so
much lately, I can't remember.

13:00.100 --> 13:02.099
I always said, if I get old and confused

13:02.100 --> 13:04.099
and I don't recognise you or the kids

13:04.100 --> 13:06.099
and I've got no quality of life,

13:06.100 --> 13:08.381
please do the humane thing
and don't give me a vasectomy.

13:10.100 --> 13:13.099
Well, the pill was about keeping
the window of opportunity open,

13:13.100 --> 13:16.099
but now, we've just decided
to slam that window shut.

13:16.100 --> 13:18.099
But we don't have to slam it
shut on my testicles, do we?

13:18.100 --> 13:21.099
Come on, are we going upstairs?

13:21.100 --> 13:25.099
I'm not really in the mood any more.
Oh, OK.

13:25.100 --> 13:28.099
Well, I suppose we'd better get
ready for Anna and Toby, anyway.

13:28.100 --> 13:32.100
Ooo! It's a bit chilly in here, isn't it?

13:46.100 --> 13:48.099
Did you put the kids down? Yeah.
I told Charlie he's a thicko

13:48.100 --> 13:51.100
and said the twins smelt
like chicken Cup-a-Soup.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.099
Look, Lucy...

13:55.100 --> 13:57.099
Oh, can you get that?
It'll be Anna and Toby.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.100
Chop chop!

14:06.100 --> 14:07.099
Hello! Hi! Hi!

14:07.100 --> 14:09.099
Oh, you just missed
the children, I'm afraid.

14:09.100 --> 14:12.099
Yes, anybody would think that Anna
makes us sit outside in the car,

14:12.100 --> 14:15.100
waiting for the kids'
bedroom light to go off.

14:18.100 --> 14:21.099
Well, I followed your advice. What,
about squeezing a lemon on it?

14:21.100 --> 14:24.099
Not about stopping fruit
salad going brown.

14:24.100 --> 14:26.099
I'm talking about your Derren
Brown mind-control tactics

14:26.100 --> 14:28.099
to make Lucy say no more kids.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.099
And?

14:29.100 --> 14:32.099
Now she wants me to have a vasectomy.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.099
Well, congratulations.

14:34.100 --> 14:38.099
Congratulations? My testicles
have just been put on death row,

14:38.100 --> 14:40.099
they've not just passed
their driving test!

14:40.100 --> 14:42.099
It solves all your problems

14:42.100 --> 14:44.099
and it's a perfectly
routine bit of surgery.

14:44.100 --> 14:48.099
When you were a kid, did you
have your tonsils taken out?

14:48.100 --> 14:50.220
Yeah, but I didn't have them
taken out of my scrotum.

14:51.100 --> 14:53.099
A vasectomy?!

14:53.100 --> 14:56.099
Oh, it's OK, it's all part of the plan.

14:56.100 --> 14:58.099
There's no way he'll go through with it,

14:58.100 --> 15:01.099
and when he backs down, the balance
of power returns to me.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.099
Oh, clever girl!

15:03.100 --> 15:05.100
You really have got him by the...

15:08.100 --> 15:10.099
How's the new car, Toby?

15:10.100 --> 15:13.099
Oh, not bad. You know,
it's no skiing holiday,

15:13.100 --> 15:16.099
but marriage is all about compromise.

15:16.100 --> 15:20.099
Exactly. And skiing
is a bit overrated, anyway.

15:20.100 --> 15:23.099
I mean, who wants to be
up to their hips in frost?

15:23.100 --> 15:25.100
Yeah. I can get that at home.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.099
This looks delicious, Lucy, thank you.

15:28.100 --> 15:30.099
Oh, it's just something simple.

15:30.100 --> 15:34.099
But where would we be
without our meat and two veg?

15:34.100 --> 15:37.100
Are you doing this deliberately?
Doing what?

15:38.100 --> 15:40.099
Sorry, I'm just a bit
stressed at the moment.

15:40.100 --> 15:42.099
Lee's having a vasectomy.

15:42.100 --> 15:45.100
I had no idea. Oh, gosh! Really?

15:46.100 --> 15:49.099
I haven't actually said I'm going
through with it. I wouldn't worry, Lee.

15:49.100 --> 15:51.099
These days, plenty of men
go in for the chop.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.099
I think people refer to it as the snip.

15:53.100 --> 15:56.100
Snip, chop, hack, slice, mince.

15:57.100 --> 15:59.100
Bludgeon.

16:01.100 --> 16:03.099
What's worrying you about it?

16:03.100 --> 16:05.099
I don't know. What if it goes wrong?

16:05.100 --> 16:08.099
What if the doctor's doing
the operation and his hand slips?

16:08.100 --> 16:10.100
A buzzer goes off and your nose lights up?

16:13.100 --> 16:17.099
Lee, a vasectomy is a perfectly
straightforward operation.

16:17.100 --> 16:20.099
There's plenty of information
available to show you how safe it is.

16:20.100 --> 16:23.099
Toby's right. I'm going to Google it.

16:23.100 --> 16:27.100
What could possibly go
wrong with a vasectomy?

16:28.100 --> 16:30.100
Oh! Ooo!

16:31.100 --> 16:34.100
Ooo, I wish I hadn't
done an Eton mess now.

16:36.100 --> 16:38.060
Have a look at that, Lee.
Yeah, have a butcher's.

16:39.100 --> 16:41.099
This is ridiculous!

16:41.100 --> 16:43.099
I can't sit by and let that sort
of ignorance go unchallenged.

16:43.100 --> 16:46.099
Oh, come on, Toby, what makes
you such an expert?

16:46.100 --> 16:48.099
I'm a doctor.

16:48.100 --> 16:50.099
And that makes you better
than Google, does it?

16:50.100 --> 16:54.099
Anyway, this isn't professional
advice, this is personal.

16:54.100 --> 16:59.100
Toby? If you have a vasectomy,
Lee, you'll be fine. I was.

17:00.100 --> 17:03.099
This is hardly conversation
for the dinner table, is it?!

17:03.100 --> 17:07.099
Well, you're the one who's got
their phone open on mangledtackle.com.

17:09.099 --> 17:11.098
So, when did you have it done?
Six years ago.

17:11.099 --> 17:12.098
It was totally fine.

17:12.099 --> 17:14.099
Would you have it done again?

17:16.099 --> 17:19.098
There wouldn't be much point
in having it done again.

17:19.099 --> 17:22.098
You know what I mean. Of course I would.
It was a simple little operation.

17:22.099 --> 17:24.098
Did it hurt? Not really.

17:24.099 --> 17:27.099
Was it embarrassing? Not at all!

17:28.099 --> 17:32.099
And how long afterwards was it
before you, you know, got to have sex?

17:32.100 --> 17:35.100
I'll keep you posted on that one.

17:37.100 --> 17:38.099
So, it really was OK?

17:38.100 --> 17:41.099
It was simple and it was painless.

17:41.100 --> 17:44.099
And more importantly, it hasn't
made me any less of a man.

17:44.100 --> 17:47.099
No? No, that was a totally
separate operation,

17:47.100 --> 17:49.100
performed by Anna slowly
over a period of years.

17:51.100 --> 17:55.099
And did you, er... offer to do
it, you know, voluntarily?

17:55.100 --> 17:58.100
Well... we discussed it.

18:01.100 --> 18:03.099
So, Anna got her way? If
Anna had got her way,

18:03.100 --> 18:06.099
I would have had it done
before our first date.

18:06.100 --> 18:08.099
I beg your pardon?

18:08.100 --> 18:09.099
I didn't mean...

18:09.100 --> 18:11.099
You mean before we had Jack?

18:11.100 --> 18:13.099
No, of course not, it
was just a silly joke.

18:13.100 --> 18:15.099
I always wanted a child, you know that,

18:15.100 --> 18:17.099
I just didn't want loads of kids.
Is that such a crime?!

18:17.100 --> 18:20.099
Of course not. And having
just one child meant

18:20.100 --> 18:22.099
we were able to devote
all our energy and attention

18:22.100 --> 18:24.099
to finding people
to properly look after him.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.099
I know that.

18:26.100 --> 18:30.099
Why is it nowadays, if you don't
want a huge, noisy family

18:30.100 --> 18:31.099
you're seen as not normal?

18:31.100 --> 18:33.099
It's hard work. You get no sleep,

18:33.100 --> 18:36.099
it costs a fortune and you
get no time to yourself!

18:36.100 --> 18:40.099
Having loads of kids robs you of everything
else you might want to achieve in life,

18:40.100 --> 18:42.099
and I'm not afraid to admit,
that's how I feel.

18:42.100 --> 18:46.100
If you ask me, the world would be a better
place if everyone was sterilised at 30!

18:50.100 --> 18:52.100
But... good luck with whatever you decide.

18:55.100 --> 18:58.099
She's right. I need to do this.

18:58.100 --> 19:00.099
For you and our family.

19:00.100 --> 19:02.099
What, you're going to do it?

19:02.100 --> 19:06.100
I need to man up and grow a pair,
and then get them sterilised.

19:08.100 --> 19:09.099
Anna's right.

19:09.100 --> 19:11.099
No, I'm not.

19:11.100 --> 19:14.099
Tell him, Toby! Tell him I'm wrong!

19:14.100 --> 19:16.100
What, in front of you?

19:25.100 --> 19:29.099
Lucy?

19:29.100 --> 19:31.099
What?

19:31.100 --> 19:32.460
We're awake before the kids again.

19:37.100 --> 19:40.099
Those novelty hot water bottles
are getting more realistic.

19:40.100 --> 19:44.099
Should I, er... scoop her
up and put her back into bed?

19:44.100 --> 19:47.099
Why? You know...

19:47.100 --> 19:51.099
This might be the last time we, er...
with me intact.

19:51.100 --> 19:54.099
End of an era, like the final
ever Boyzone concert.

19:54.100 --> 19:57.100
Except I won't reform in 20
years and produce new material.

20:00.100 --> 20:03.100
You're still going
through with the vasectomy, then? 'Course.

20:06.100 --> 20:09.099
Oh! Well, that was wonderful.
How was it for you(?)

20:09.100 --> 20:11.099
Let's have a tickling competition.

20:11.100 --> 20:13.099
First one to wet themselves
makes breakfast!

20:13.100 --> 20:14.099
You're in a good mood.

20:14.100 --> 20:18.099
Well, we've made a positive
decision, haven't we?

20:18.100 --> 20:21.099
I'm going to bring you breakfast in bed.

20:21.100 --> 20:24.100
How about cereal with sterilised
milk and seedless grapes?

20:27.100 --> 20:29.099
I can't believe that by tonight,
it might all be over.

20:29.100 --> 20:33.099
You're not seeing someone
about it today, are you? Why not?

20:33.100 --> 20:35.099
Well, they wouldn't do it
there and then, surely.

20:35.100 --> 20:36.099
It's not while-you-wait.

20:36.100 --> 20:40.099
Well, I don't think you drop 'em
off and call back to pick 'em up later.

20:40.100 --> 20:41.099
The sooner we do it, the better.

20:41.100 --> 20:43.491
And in the meantime, we need
to make the most of these

20:43.516 --> 20:45.099
little monkeys whilst they're young.

20:45.100 --> 20:47.100
Doesn't last forever, does it?

20:50.100 --> 20:53.099
Don't worry, kids,
Mummy's doing happy crying.

20:53.100 --> 20:57.100
Why don't you go downstairs and put
the television on... really loudly?

21:00.100 --> 21:01.099
What's the matter?

21:01.100 --> 21:03.099
I don't want you to have a vasectomy.

21:03.100 --> 21:06.099
What do you want? Another baby.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.099
You said yesterday you changed your mind.

21:08.100 --> 21:12.100
I only said that to manipulate you.
It was Anna's idea.

21:13.100 --> 21:17.099
You've been taking relationship
advice from Frosty the Snow Cow?

21:17.100 --> 21:19.099
Oh, like you haven't been manipulating me?

21:19.100 --> 21:21.099
So let me get this straight,

21:21.100 --> 21:23.099
you asked me to have a vasectomy
because you want a baby?

21:23.100 --> 21:25.099
That's a novel approach(!)

21:25.100 --> 21:28.099
I just wanted to keep
the possibility open, that's all.

21:28.100 --> 21:30.099
But when things started to sound so final,

21:30.100 --> 21:32.460
it made me think I actually
definitely do want another one.

21:34.100 --> 21:36.099
I didn't think you'd agree
to the vasectomy!

21:36.100 --> 21:39.099
I did agree, because I listen
to your needs and I do what you want.

21:39.100 --> 21:43.099
Good. I want another baby.

21:43.100 --> 21:44.420
I walked into that one, didn't I?

21:51.100 --> 21:53.100
It has to be a mutual decision.

21:54.100 --> 21:57.099
I know. But if I don't
agree to another baby,

21:57.100 --> 21:59.099
then I'm responsible
for Lucy being miserable.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.099
Lee, you're a married man,
you took a solemn vow

22:01.100 --> 22:04.100
to be responsible
for Lucy being miserable.

22:05.100 --> 22:07.099
There is one other way
of looking at this, of course.

22:07.100 --> 22:10.099
Maybe you should just
count your blessings.

22:10.100 --> 22:12.099
I have counted them.

22:12.100 --> 22:14.099
I've got three blessings and I adore them,

22:14.100 --> 22:15.099
but kids are like Pot Noodles,

22:15.100 --> 22:17.100
nobody needs more than three at a time.

22:19.100 --> 22:22.099
Count your blessings that Lucy's the kind
of woman that wants more.

22:22.100 --> 22:24.099
I never had that option with Anna.

22:24.100 --> 22:26.099
I know, and I do appreciate it.

22:26.100 --> 22:29.099
Lucy's an amazing mum,
and I love being a dad,

22:29.100 --> 22:30.099
but, come on, four?!

22:30.100 --> 22:33.100
I wanted to start a family,
not a Beatles tribute act.

22:34.100 --> 22:38.099
Would having one more child really
make such a huge difference?

22:38.100 --> 22:40.099
Don't they start looking
after one another when you have a few?

22:40.100 --> 22:42.099
No, they do not!

22:42.100 --> 22:45.099
You still have to clothe them,
and bathe them, and breast-feed them.

22:45.100 --> 22:47.100
Wow! You're more hands-on than I thought.

22:50.100 --> 22:51.099
You still have to look
after them, tell them off,

22:51.100 --> 22:54.099
break up fights, check for lice,

22:54.100 --> 22:57.099
take that little seat
on and off the toilet,

22:57.100 --> 23:01.099
chase them, have play fights in bed,

23:01.100 --> 23:03.099
teach them all the rude
words to Jingle Bells

23:03.100 --> 23:06.099
and deny all knowledge of it
at the carol concert.

23:06.100 --> 23:08.099
Have you considered the possibility

23:08.100 --> 23:11.100
that you might actually quite
like to have another child?

23:13.100 --> 23:16.099
I did once have four
Pot Noodles, actually.

23:16.100 --> 23:18.100
Maybe having another baby
is not such a bad idea.

23:20.100 --> 23:22.099
Not me and him, we're not having a baby.

23:22.100 --> 23:24.100
I've had a vasectomy, anyway.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.260
Why are you so proud of that?

23:40.100 --> 23:42.099
How did you know I was here?

23:42.100 --> 23:44.420
I checked Wetherspoons
and Ladbrokes, where else was left?

23:46.100 --> 23:48.099
Toby told me you were meeting Anna here.

23:48.100 --> 23:50.099
You've not been for the operation,
have you?

23:50.100 --> 23:52.340
If I'd been for a vasectomy,
would I be able to do this?

24:00.100 --> 24:03.100
Tinder, eh? Wish I'd swiped left now.

24:07.100 --> 24:10.099
Sorry I got so emotional this morning.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.099
You've got nothing to be sorry about.

24:11.100 --> 24:14.100
Faster! OK!

24:15.100 --> 24:17.099
We need to talk about this
properly, though.

24:17.100 --> 24:19.099
You mean without trying
to manipulate each other?

24:19.100 --> 24:23.100
Yeah. Honestly and openly,
like we should have done from the start.

24:25.100 --> 24:28.099
Or we could just let the wise old sage from
the village have another crack at things(!)

24:28.100 --> 24:32.099
Oh, Anna, Anna, Anna!

24:32.100 --> 24:34.340
It's true, say her name
three times and she does appear.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.100
Go and play with the other children, Jack.

24:40.100 --> 24:41.099
Hi, Jack!

24:41.100 --> 24:44.099
Lucy... Lee, I wanted to apologise

24:44.100 --> 24:46.099
for my outburst at dinner last night,

24:46.100 --> 24:49.100
and I certainly shouldn't have told
Lucy to try to manipulate you, Lee.

24:51.100 --> 24:55.099
And I shouldn't have told Lee to try
and manipulate you, either, Lucy.

24:55.100 --> 24:57.100
I didn't know you had.

24:59.100 --> 25:01.100
I'm going to go and stand over there now.

25:04.100 --> 25:07.099
It's none of my business,
I know, but just because

25:07.100 --> 25:10.099
I don't want a bigger family
doesn't mean you two shouldn't.

25:10.100 --> 25:12.099
I mean, look how happy those kids are.

25:12.100 --> 25:13.099
No! Argh!

25:13.100 --> 25:15.099
Toby, drop any of those
children in the dirt

25:15.100 --> 25:17.100
and you'll be the one who's crying!

25:19.100 --> 25:22.100
Why not have more?
You've got such great kids.

25:24.100 --> 25:26.099
That'd be nice, growing old,
surrounded by so many of 'em.

25:26.100 --> 25:29.099
'Course it would. Children are a blessing.

25:29.100 --> 25:32.099
Oh, for God's sake! Toby,
show some authority!

25:32.100 --> 25:34.099
You're supposed to be the Alpha!

25:34.100 --> 25:39.100
Look, four kids. It's not
that different to three, is it?

25:42.100 --> 25:45.100
Mm. One per limb.

25:48.100 --> 25:52.099
Four could be a wonderful
experience for you both.

25:52.100 --> 25:54.099
Benji, be careful with Toby!

25:54.100 --> 25:56.099
Leave him. Toby needs to learn.

25:56.100 --> 25:59.099
Toby, stop showing your weakness!

25:59.100 --> 26:00.220
One of them's got my wallet!

26:02.100 --> 26:05.099
I'm sure whatever you decide
will be the right thing.

26:05.100 --> 26:07.099
Help!

26:07.100 --> 26:09.099
Jack, get off your father!

26:09.100 --> 26:11.100
No teeth, you're riddled with germs!

26:14.100 --> 26:16.099
Four kids, eh! Help!

26:16.100 --> 26:19.100
Yeah. Who wouldn't want that? Help!

26:29.100 --> 26:31.099
I was ashamed of our children today.

26:31.100 --> 26:33.099
We need to think of a punishment.

26:33.100 --> 26:35.099
I already have.

26:35.100 --> 26:37.620
I've told them, no more beating
up Toby for the next two weeks.

26:38.100 --> 26:42.099
I've not really thought through how
difficult having four kids is, have I?

26:42.100 --> 26:44.099
No, but that's what we need to do,

26:44.100 --> 26:46.099
have a proper discussion
about everything and...

26:46.100 --> 26:48.099
Actually, can we not, just for a while?

26:48.100 --> 26:52.099
I'm not saying no more kids, nor am
I definitely saying I do want more.

26:52.100 --> 26:57.099
I'm just saying, can we just
see how things go for a bit,

26:57.100 --> 26:59.099
stop putting so much
pressure on ourselves?

26:59.100 --> 27:01.099
Yeah.

27:01.100 --> 27:03.099
And who knows, if we do stop at three,

27:03.100 --> 27:05.099
maybe we'll save enough money
to afford a treat.

27:05.100 --> 27:07.099
Perhaps even a skiing holiday.

27:07.100 --> 27:09.100
You're not getting a sports car.

27:11.100 --> 27:13.099
So if we're not talking about stuff,

27:13.100 --> 27:16.099
we're going to need to think
of something else to do.

27:16.100 --> 27:20.099
Ooo! Somebody's been watching Magnum PI.

27:20.100 --> 27:21.099
What did you have in mind?

27:21.100 --> 27:23.100
Well, come a little closer
and I'll show you.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.100
Yee-haw!

27:33.100 --> 27:36.100
Can I sleep in your bed again?

27:37.100 --> 27:39.099
Go on, then. Get in.

27:39.100 --> 27:41.100
Yay! Ooo!

27:42.100 --> 27:44.099
Oh, you know what?

27:44.100 --> 27:47.100
I think more kids might be
out of the question now, anyway.
