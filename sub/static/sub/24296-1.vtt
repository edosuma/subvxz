01:24.293 --> 01:29.965
Commencing training mission.
Suppress and detain the Ghost.

01:31.133 --> 01:32.175
Engage!

01:39.850 --> 01:43.437
The Ghost's a combat expert,
do not engage him solo.

01:43.812 --> 01:47.983
Split into smaller teams to
surround the target.

01:48.317 --> 01:49.443
Roger.

01:52.070 --> 01:55.657
No man can repel an
attack from all sides.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.452
But the timing must be perfect.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.226
Unit 01, clear.

03:04.559 --> 03:05.560
Unit, 02, roger.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.413
What's the matter, Ghost?

03:25.372 --> 03:26.581
<i>Why aren't you moving?</i>

03:27.958 --> 03:29.584
<i>Ghost, respond!</i>

04:06.788 --> 04:09.958
<i>Man down at point B.
Lots of bloo</i> - -

04:10.083 --> 04:13.962
What happened?
Unit 03, report! Hey!

04:18.216 --> 04:19.468
What was that?

04:20.635 --> 04:22.804
Team Charlie! What's going on?

04:24.431 --> 04:26.308
<i>This is Team Charlie.
Not su</i> - -

04:27.684 --> 04:29.978
All units!
The mission is compromised!

04:30.228 --> 04:31.438
<i>I'm calling it off!</i>

04:31.563 --> 04:35.984
<i>Unknown subject has
infiltrated the facility!</i>

04:36.193 --> 04:39.237
<i>Team Delta! Echo!
Rendezvous immediately!</i>

05:12.896 --> 05:14.981
Don't shoot!
We have no live ammo!

05:15.190 --> 05:16.358
Use your knives!

05:29.246 --> 05:32.541
Hey! What's going on?!
Respond!

07:31.534 --> 07:32.661
What'cha got?

07:32.786 --> 07:33.954
A cat?

07:34.079 --> 07:36.665
Ew! Gross!

07:42.420 --> 07:46.675
<i>Heroes don't always look like
they do in history books.</i>

07:48.426 --> 07:54.349
<i>God sends them to us in many forms.</i>

07:55.850 --> 07:57.852
<i>And when the world's in chaos,</i>

07:58.853 --> 08:01.189
<i>a hero appears to set things right.</i>

08:02.899 --> 08:07.862
<i>Perhaps because the world falls
apart in the hands of man.</i>

08:09.531 --> 08:11.116
<i>When the world changes,</i>

08:11.616 --> 08:16.538
<i>blood is always shed
and people always die.</i>

08:18.540 --> 08:20.709
<i>All we can do in this world...</i>

08:21.334 --> 08:25.046
<i>is to fall on our knees and pray.</i>

08:27.382 --> 08:30.719
<i>But if you listen carefully,</i>

08:32.053 --> 08:34.139
<i>you'll hear a hero inspiring you.</i>

08:35.181 --> 08:36.390
<i>Live.</i>

08:36.890 --> 08:37.892
<i>Rage.</i>

08:38.393 --> 08:39.394
<i>Raise your voice,</i>

08:40.227 --> 08:41.895
<i>and revive the world.</i>

08:43.063 --> 08:45.900
<i>This hero inspires me...</i>

08:46.985 --> 08:51.656
<i>to struggle on in a world I cannot escape.</i>

10:08.983 --> 10:13.154
Uncle!
Don't surprise me like that!

10:14.531 --> 10:17.992
Just a minute, Sachi.
Need to change the light.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.162
Watch out.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.338
<i>On break from 4:00pm - 12:00am</i>

10:32.715 --> 10:34.175
<i>Taste Shining Justice!</i>

10:35.301 --> 10:37.679
Sachi, which guy do you like?

10:37.887 --> 10:40.849
Huh? The hero, of course!

10:42.016 --> 10:43.016
I see...

10:44.269 --> 10:46.146
Here you go!

10:46.271 --> 10:47.480
Thank you!

10:49.816 --> 10:54.154
You won't get any bigger on
convenience store bento alone!

10:54.529 --> 10:57.031
This is so good!

10:57.198 --> 10:58.198
Ain't m?

10:59.033 --> 11:00.535
You want anything, Toshiro?

11:01.286 --> 11:04.330
No way. He never eats anything.

11:14.757 --> 11:15.884
Hey, Sachi...

11:17.886 --> 11:18.886
Check this out.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.891
Pardon me. If you don't mind.

11:24.726 --> 11:25.727
Here we go!

11:34.611 --> 11:36.821
Tsuno, that's so cool!

11:37.739 --> 11:40.408
<i>Justice will always triumph!</i>

13:06.953 --> 13:08.329
Are you all right?

13:20.258 --> 13:23.344
<i>The Beginning of the End of the Legend</i>

13:41.279 --> 13:42.655
Have a good night!

13:45.366 --> 13:48.036
"Life draws strength from its wounds,"

13:48.870 --> 13:51.205
"and darkness is righteous."

13:51.622 --> 13:55.710
"Which is why I had nothing to
say to that flower..."

13:56.627 --> 14:00.548
<i>"That's not to say that I'm waiting for
the coming storm,"</i>

14:01.090 --> 14:05.803
<i>"nor the uncontrollable beast lurking
inside of me."</i>

15:12.787 --> 15:15.456
You were just pretending to sleep!

15:17.959 --> 15:19.460
I've got you now!

15:24.757 --> 15:25.800
I see...

15:26.843 --> 15:31.139
Very well. I'll prescribe you some
stronger medication.

15:35.643 --> 15:36.644
Doctor.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.186
Yes?

15:38.646 --> 15:40.148
Can I talk about my dream?

15:41.524 --> 15:42.650
Of course.

15:44.193 --> 15:48.614
I'm fighting in the woods...

15:49.282 --> 15:51.325
Killing person after person...

15:53.035 --> 15:54.620
Then, I wake up.

15:55.037 --> 15:59.333
But I still smell the blood.
Still feel that killer instinct.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.135
That must be very painful.

16:10.636 --> 16:13.306
Painful? Not at all.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.350
It feels... nostalgic.

16:17.852 --> 16:21.022
Nostalgic? Aren't you afraid?

16:21.481 --> 16:22.690
Of what?

16:23.858 --> 16:28.488
Well, you're... killing people.
In the dream, anyway.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.532
That's nothing to fear.

16:32.033 --> 16:34.869
I kill to complete the mission.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.205
Mission?

16:38.039 --> 16:39.040
Yes.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.875
My mission.

17:03.147 --> 17:08.528
<i>The Beginning of the End of the Legend</i>

17:17.203 --> 17:18.412
Whether it's a stab...

17:20.414 --> 17:21.665
or a cut...

17:22.250 --> 17:23.834
you will bleed.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.547
It will hurt.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.092
Read it. It'll be good for you.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.254
Good morning!

18:24.186 --> 18:25.186
Gimme the money!

18:25.771 --> 18:27.940
Hurry! Hey!

18:28.608 --> 18:29.692
Hurry the fuck up!

18:44.206 --> 18:45.625
Thank you very much.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.756
One 10,000 yen bill...

18:53.174 --> 18:54.634
<i>And three 1900s.</i>

19:13.402 --> 19:14.904
Uncle Ken!

19:16.489 --> 19:17.657
Sachi!

19:18.991 --> 19:19.992
Sachi.

19:21.202 --> 19:22.411
C'mere, Sachi...

19:22.787 --> 19:24.497
You're full of energy.

19:24.789 --> 19:27.458
You look great, too!
Can I push you?

19:27.583 --> 19:28.668
Sure.

19:53.109 --> 19:55.027
Breeze feels good, doesn't it?

19:55.444 --> 19:57.113
Yes, it does.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.367
Something smells nice.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.621
What's wrong?

20:06.288 --> 20:09.792
Since when were you a paedophile?

20:10.334 --> 20:11.711
Toshiro?

20:13.879 --> 20:15.548
You were wide open, buddy.

20:16.507 --> 20:18.175
You're one to talk.

20:21.053 --> 20:25.391
Remember. If not for me,
you wouldn't be alive right now.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.815
Mind giving me your hand?

20:40.072 --> 20:41.907
It's cute as a button...

20:42.116 --> 20:43.242
Hey!

20:57.131 --> 20:58.924
Got a lot of free time, so...

20:59.967 --> 21:03.179
I'm making you something.
Part of my therapy.

21:07.433 --> 21:10.853
Holding hands, then gifts?
Are you into guys?

21:12.271 --> 21:13.606
Good question...

21:16.567 --> 21:18.736
Bye-bye, Uncle Ken!

21:28.537 --> 21:30.414
Bye-bye!

21:33.751 --> 21:36.962
When's he gonna get better?

21:37.171 --> 21:39.215
How did he get so hurt, anyway?

21:41.634 --> 21:45.638
Kenji got hurt protecting me.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.765
Protecting you?

21:58.692 --> 21:59.985
Toshiro...

22:07.326 --> 22:09.495
- Sachi.
- Yes?

22:09.703 --> 22:12.832
I forgot something.
I'll meet you back home, OK?

22:12.998 --> 22:14.500
OK.

24:06.570 --> 24:08.280
Hey, you okay?

24:09.907 --> 24:11.617
Is he dead?!

25:28.152 --> 25:30.362
Sachi, you made it back.

25:34.408 --> 25:37.202
Think it'll stop raining soon?

25:58.182 --> 26:00.559
Lady, you're drenched.

26:02.019 --> 26:03.854
Gonna catch a cold...

26:06.190 --> 26:08.358
You two should warm me up, then.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.905
With pleasure!

26:26.460 --> 26:29.546
<i>Ghost just killed Rock
and one of his troops.</i>

26:29.922 --> 26:31.548
<i>Bodies have been dealt with.</i>

26:32.132 --> 26:36.428
Newt, Fox, and Eagle are on standby.
Abyss Walker, unknown.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.223
What are your orders?

26:39.932 --> 26:41.433
Wait, Casper.

26:42.476 --> 26:46.355
We know where Ghost is.
Why can't we take him out now?

26:46.980 --> 26:50.067
<i>We came all the way out here...</i>

26:50.609 --> 26:53.779
<i>Let an old man have his fun.</i>

26:55.280 --> 26:56.615
Of course, sir.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.786
Where is Abyss Walker now?

27:01.286 --> 27:05.290
On the move. He fought the
Defense Force three days ago.

27:05.666 --> 27:09.753
But we haven't heard from him since.

27:11.630 --> 27:17.302
Why bring him on this mission? He kills
everything that moves. Ally or enemy.

27:18.595 --> 27:21.807
<i>His skill speaks for itself.</i>

27:23.350 --> 27:28.605
<i>The other three brought their own units
along, so why do we need him?</i>

27:30.774 --> 27:32.943
He thirsts.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.573
And that thirst means...

27:38.657 --> 27:41.493
every wound makes him stronger.

28:04.516 --> 28:05.517
Thank you!

28:09.521 --> 28:13.192
<i>Doctor, imagine you're caught in an
extreme situation.</i>

28:13.692 --> 28:15.652
Can you imagine surviving?

28:16.945 --> 28:18.280
What do you mean?

28:20.324 --> 28:24.828
Like having a gun to your head or
your friends caught in a blast.

28:25.454 --> 28:28.040
You know, a matter of life or death.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.127
I...

28:32.294 --> 28:33.712
You'd lose it.

28:35.005 --> 28:36.798
Most people would, right?

28:38.217 --> 28:39.217
I suppose.

28:39.593 --> 28:41.553
But some people are different.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.681
These people need to...

28:45.724 --> 28:48.560
put themselves in danger
to feel normal.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.316
Going back to your dream...

28:54.775 --> 28:58.403
Do you feel guilty taking people's
lives, Mr. Kuroda?

28:58.570 --> 28:59.696
Never.

29:00.572 --> 29:04.868
Processing them's like cutting
the strings of a puppet.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.912
They just collapse.

29:07.162 --> 29:08.747
There's no emotion.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.165
Process?

29:11.416 --> 29:12.416
But...

29:12.584 --> 29:15.754
the moment I process them...
I feel love.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.047
Love?

29:17.172 --> 29:20.926
I feel their heartbeat, their warmth,
their thoughts...

29:21.843 --> 29:23.595
...and how they all converge.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.598
Then I gently process them.

29:30.435 --> 29:35.357
So, are you not afraid of being killed?

29:35.482 --> 29:38.777
Don't know.
I've never experienced death.

29:41.780 --> 29:46.451
Fair point.
Then let's use your imagination.

29:48.620 --> 29:52.791
Pretend this is a real gun and
I'm trying to shoot you...

29:53.458 --> 29:55.127
Do it!

30:08.307 --> 30:10.726
Doctor... I've just killed you.

30:20.485 --> 30:23.780
<i>Last night, two men were found dead...</i>

30:24.031 --> 30:26.450
Whoa, that's the next town over!

30:26.908 --> 30:31.663
Guy who did this better hope
I don't get my hands on him!

30:31.830 --> 30:34.750
You'd knock him right out!

30:34.916 --> 30:37.002
Hell yeah! Just leave him to me!

30:39.504 --> 30:40.505
Wait...

30:44.343 --> 30:45.344
Huh?

30:47.054 --> 30:49.181
That's odd... It's brand new.

30:50.098 --> 30:52.684
Old man at the shop cheated me!

30:54.686 --> 30:58.273
No signal? That's odd

31:01.026 --> 31:05.530
Sachi, I left something at the store.
I'm gonna go pick it up.

31:05.781 --> 31:07.324
What? Now?

31:09.201 --> 31:10.202
Sorry, Tsuno...

31:11.161 --> 31:15.165
Do you mind keeping an eye
on her for a little while?

31:15.332 --> 31:16.875
No problem.

31:17.209 --> 31:20.629
Sachi, let's play some Cat's Cradle!

31:28.053 --> 31:31.056
Toshiro, that's pathetic.
Right, Sachi?

31:32.724 --> 31:33.892
Yeah, he missed!

33:07.777 --> 33:08.820
Good evening.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.712
Kenji send you?

35:38.803 --> 35:41.598
We took care of those
bodies in the alley.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.643
Mind handling these ones, too?

35:46.311 --> 35:49.314
Phantom just paid Kenji a little visit.

35:50.231 --> 35:52.942
I know... He said hi to Sachi, too.

35:54.069 --> 35:57.489
We're going to fight by your side.

35:59.824 --> 36:02.327
How many missions have you been on?

36:03.328 --> 36:04.579
None.

36:06.331 --> 36:09.000
I'll look after him...

36:10.251 --> 36:12.962
Or, you think we'll get in your way?

36:24.891 --> 36:26.017
Suit yourself.

36:30.146 --> 36:32.857
<i>Kenji Makabe</i>

36:39.948 --> 36:41.658
Huh? Where's Kenji?

36:42.117 --> 36:43.326
Not here...?

36:43.785 --> 36:45.495
You two doing your job?

36:46.496 --> 36:47.789
We're trying!

36:47.914 --> 36:49.374
So what?

36:50.625 --> 36:52.168
I'm looking for results.

36:53.628 --> 36:57.674
We know! But this happened to you
because of Toshiro.

36:57.799 --> 36:59.050
Shut up!

37:02.554 --> 37:05.056
I'm not using you because I want to!

37:06.725 --> 37:08.560
I wanted to die for him

37:09.561 --> 37:11.396
to be reduced to ashes.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.602
Hey, could I speak to Sachi?

37:52.020 --> 37:53.020
<i>Hello?</i>

37:53.104 --> 37:54.230
Sachi?

37:56.024 --> 37:57.442
Just a sec...

38:23.635 --> 38:25.470
<i>Uncle, are you there?</i>

38:28.056 --> 38:30.099
Sachi, I'm sorry.

38:31.476 --> 38:34.145
<i>What? What did you say?</i>

38:34.562 --> 38:35.647
<i>Hello?</i>

38:43.905 --> 38:45.824
I'm sorry, Sachi.

38:46.241 --> 38:49.828
<i>I can't come home for a while.
Stay with Tsuno.</i>

39:16.020 --> 39:17.522
Toshiro?

39:21.025 --> 39:22.318
Perfect timing.

39:25.321 --> 39:27.323
I remember you cared for this book.

39:34.539 --> 39:35.874
Thanks.

39:39.294 --> 39:41.504
Are those two helping at all?

39:42.881 --> 39:44.215
Yeah.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.676
They're carrying my stuff.

39:49.721 --> 39:54.559
Max is a veteran,
but this is Masaru's first mission.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.353
I'm worried about him.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.355
That's the tall one?

40:00.565 --> 40:03.359
Well, he's more useful than you are.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.093
I heard from Kenji.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.765
Phantom was the CO of the unit

40:33.932 --> 40:37.226
that both he and Toshiro belonged to.

40:38.686 --> 40:43.274
Toshiro's three years retired.
Why's Phantom acting now?

40:49.864 --> 40:51.407
International crimes?

40:54.118 --> 40:56.120
Yeah, international crimes.

40:56.371 --> 40:58.623
All while leading such a powerful unit?

40:59.290 --> 41:00.792
That's disgusting...

41:06.381 --> 41:08.424
Brainwashing children.

41:11.427 --> 41:12.637
<i>Brainwashing?</i>

41:14.931 --> 41:18.768
Toshiro couldn't take it
so he turned on Phantom.

41:19.644 --> 41:20.812
Got himself taken out.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.145
Taken out?!

41:32.323 --> 41:35.118
10 on east. 8 on north.
All standing by.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.663
It's from Abyss Walker!

41:39.747 --> 41:41.165
But I can't make it out.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.006
<i>That's my prey!</i>

41:48.589 --> 41:50.466
What's your location?

41:50.842 --> 41:52.468
<i>Do not get in my way!</i>

41:55.722 --> 41:57.640
Do we really need him?

41:58.474 --> 42:01.978
Abyss knows Ghost very well.

42:03.479 --> 42:07.483
They used to be buddies.

42:09.277 --> 42:10.361
Seriously?

42:12.697 --> 42:17.994
They were similar in many ways,
but different in purpose.

42:44.729 --> 42:46.189
<i>Light...</i>

42:47.231 --> 42:48.524
<i>and darkness.</i>

42:50.818 --> 42:53.905
Abyss Walker wanted
freedom and destruction.

42:54.989 --> 42:56.365
Nothing more.

43:05.708 --> 43:06.708
Casper.

43:07.960 --> 43:09.212
It's time.

43:11.089 --> 43:15.635
When Phantom found out Toshiro was alive,
he swore vengeance.

43:15.802 --> 43:18.096
But why'd he come here himself?

43:18.387 --> 43:19.430
Well...

43:24.102 --> 43:26.104
That's not our business.

43:27.105 --> 43:28.397
We cover Toshiro.

43:36.030 --> 43:37.573
Kenji used to tell us.

43:39.951 --> 43:43.412
War is no place for children or machines.

43:45.790 --> 43:47.125
This is so messed up.

44:02.473 --> 44:03.766
Toshiro...

44:07.979 --> 44:09.814
Take me with you.

44:13.943 --> 44:16.487
Those rookies aren't good enough, right?

44:18.823 --> 44:20.449
I can still fight!

44:22.285 --> 44:26.330
Toshiro, please!

44:29.250 --> 44:30.293
Hey.

44:33.754 --> 44:34.881
I'm begging you!

44:36.257 --> 44:37.842
Please!

44:41.637 --> 44:43.347
Take me!

44:46.100 --> 44:48.644
I won't get in your way!

44:51.189 --> 44:53.482
I want to die on the battlefield!

44:55.193 --> 44:57.528
Dammit, take me with you!!

45:05.036 --> 45:06.329
Kenji!

45:07.788 --> 45:10.374
Don't do this. It doesn't suit you.

45:25.431 --> 45:28.684
I heard Toshiro's code name was "Ghost".

45:29.018 --> 45:31.938
As in, the legendary Reborn Ghost?

45:32.063 --> 45:33.064
Doubt it.

45:34.065 --> 45:35.691
It's just a legend, right?

45:39.654 --> 45:41.072
You ready?

46:01.008 --> 46:02.093
Do you need this?

46:14.730 --> 46:17.900
Animals are simple.

46:20.444 --> 46:21.612
This will suffice.

47:05.781 --> 47:08.492
Hey, Toshiro?! It's Tsuno.

47:08.617 --> 47:12.163
I can't find Sachi!
Tell me she's with you.

47:13.497 --> 47:14.999
Yeah, she's here.

47:15.791 --> 47:18.336
Oh, thank God.

47:19.503 --> 47:21.630
Sorry to bug you, then.

47:22.423 --> 47:24.508
No problem.
Thanks for the call.

47:29.013 --> 47:30.806
Did something happen to Sachi?

47:33.309 --> 47:34.810
Did someone kidnap her?

47:35.811 --> 47:37.146
Don't worry.

47:38.022 --> 47:39.523
It's all part of the plan.

47:40.191 --> 47:41.359
What plan?

47:42.610 --> 47:44.320
Now I know their location.

47:47.948 --> 47:50.159
They didn't steal Sachi from me.

47:51.619 --> 47:52.828
I let them take her.

48:38.374 --> 48:41.001
You've really grown up.

48:44.672 --> 48:46.382
Oh, don't you worry.

48:47.466 --> 48:52.012
I'm an old friend of your uncle's.

49:02.314 --> 49:06.110
And I am very glad
your uncle is still alive.

49:06.902 --> 49:08.404
What do you mean?

49:09.321 --> 49:15.411
Do you know why your uncle
risked so much to save you?

49:17.079 --> 49:20.040
Would you like to know?

49:27.756 --> 49:29.425
Because...

49:29.758 --> 49:33.929
the same blood courses
through both of your veins.

49:35.890 --> 49:37.391
I believe...

49:38.851 --> 49:41.061
that he could see.

49:42.521 --> 49:43.772
The future.

49:45.774 --> 49:48.611
But, he betrayed me.

49:49.612 --> 49:51.947
And for that, he has to die.

49:53.282 --> 49:56.118
This is not a battle.

49:59.622 --> 50:01.081
It's an execution.

50:24.313 --> 50:25.648
She's in those ruins.

50:26.815 --> 50:29.443
We move together until they're in sight.

50:29.985 --> 50:31.028
Let's go.

50:48.587 --> 50:49.964
I count five enemies.

50:52.341 --> 50:53.801
The main building is here.

50:54.176 --> 50:55.803
And we are here.

50:56.554 --> 50:57.972
One company.

50:58.764 --> 51:00.140
One platoon.

51:02.017 --> 51:03.143
One platoon.

51:03.686 --> 51:04.687
One platoon.

51:06.021 --> 51:08.148
I'll draw their attention.

51:08.357 --> 51:11.026
Move in two-man cell
and attack from here.

51:11.443 --> 51:13.153
How many enemies?

51:13.279 --> 51:17.366
About 30 people to a platoon,
and 80 to a company...

51:20.202 --> 51:21.370
That many?!

51:22.288 --> 51:23.163
We're three men!

51:23.289 --> 51:24.832
I could handle them alone.

51:25.249 --> 51:26.542
Remain calm

51:26.959 --> 51:28.836
even if you're shot or stabbed.

51:29.211 --> 51:30.713
Be prepared to end in a draw.

51:32.047 --> 51:36.552
Nerves cloud your thoughts.
It's how herbivores get eaten.

51:36.719 --> 51:38.846
Carnivores don't get nervous.

51:39.471 --> 51:41.181
Are we here to be hunted?

51:41.724 --> 51:42.725
No!

51:43.392 --> 51:44.727
We are the hunters.

51:59.658 --> 52:03.412
<i>The Ghost stays silent and
shows no sign of his approach.</i>

52:03.829 --> 52:05.247
Try to hold your fire.

52:06.040 --> 52:08.542
<i>The sound will tell him where you are.</i>

52:09.668 --> 52:13.922
<i>Fire only when you have a clear
shot at the target.</i>

53:39.675 --> 53:43.804
<i>Point Bravo, reporting gunfire.
Possible diversion.</i>

53:44.096 --> 53:46.306
<i>Stay alert!</i>

56:50.032 --> 56:52.200
Point Bravo, under fire!

57:21.813 --> 57:23.398
The enemy has broken through!

57:24.316 --> 57:26.068
Deploying reserve forces.

01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:50.647
Don't shoot!

01:00:51.273 --> 01:00:52.274
A kid?

01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:36.651
You won't survive the
battlefield like that.

01:01:37.903 --> 01:01:39.154
War is...

01:01:39.988 --> 01:01:42.324
no place for children or machines!

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:25.700
Kenji...

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.328
I'm sorry.

01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:04.544
You're too soft for this world, old man.

01:06:13.928 --> 01:06:16.890
I'll manage to survive somehow.

01:07:10.902 --> 01:07:13.112
Max, you go on ahead.

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:16.115
I'll finish things up here.

01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:30.338
<i>Reserve forces down. Echo, Charlie, move
towards the ruins.</i>

01:07:30.505 --> 01:07:31.505
<i>Echo, roger.</i>

01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:34.467
<i>Be advised, the Ghost is
an entire squad unto himself.</i>

01:07:34.842 --> 01:07:36.636
<i>Do not think of him as human. Over.</i>

01:08:30.023 --> 01:08:31.064
Quit using the guns!

01:08:31.232 --> 01:08:33.901
Get in close and stab him!
Behind him!

01:10:22.343 --> 01:10:23.803
<i>Take me!</i>

01:10:27.014 --> 01:10:29.475
I won't get in your way!

01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:34.188
I want to die on the battlefield!

01:10:36.023 --> 01:10:38.192
Dammit, take me with you!!

01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:55.042
Don't fail me, Kenji.

01:13:38.539 --> 01:13:42.043
<i>Our war is not fought for the
sake of children.</i>

01:13:51.469 --> 01:13:53.220
My war was over.

01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:23.250
<i>Frontline is down. No response...</i>

01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:25.544
<i>Block the Ghost!</i>

01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:29.256
<i>What? Say again, over!</i>

01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:34.929
<i>The frontline has been eliminated.
Stay on high alert.</i>

01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:41.227
Do you like fairy tales?

01:14:42.687 --> 01:14:47.191
The battlefield has its
fair share of legends.

01:14:48.859 --> 01:14:52.780
One of which is
the Legend of the Reborn Ghost.

01:14:55.616 --> 01:15:00.246
The Reborn Ghost has been seen
fighting in a number of wars...

01:15:01.622 --> 01:15:07.420
The infamous Vietnam,
Afghanistan and Iraq.

01:15:08.295 --> 01:15:13.300
He's said to have survived
all sorts of impossible missions.

01:15:14.051 --> 01:15:17.972
Of course,
I don't put much stake in fairy tales.

01:15:18.305 --> 01:15:21.809
If he were real,
he would be older than me.

01:15:24.311 --> 01:15:25.438
And yet...

01:15:27.148 --> 01:15:30.609
your uncle's codename, "Ghost".

01:15:32.319 --> 01:15:35.614
It comes from this man.

01:15:37.324 --> 01:15:40.661
As if he intends to fight
like the legend...

01:15:41.996 --> 01:15:47.793
<i>The Legendary Reborn Ghost.</i>

01:17:16.674 --> 01:17:18.425
Uncle!

01:17:27.434 --> 01:17:30.771
Max, look after Sachi

01:17:31.522 --> 01:17:32.773
Certainly.

01:17:36.861 --> 01:17:38.946
Uncle!

01:17:40.948 --> 01:17:42.116
Sachi...

01:17:42.616 --> 01:17:45.953
Don't worry. I'll be back, I promise.

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.913
You're lying!

01:17:48.956 --> 01:17:53.085
If you go now, you won't come back,

01:17:54.295 --> 01:17:57.298
so don't leave me!

01:17:59.466 --> 01:18:00.801
Sachi...

01:18:02.136 --> 01:18:03.637
I'll be back.

01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:05.139
No!

01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:08.475
Let's go home together!

01:18:09.476 --> 01:18:11.478
Don't leave me...

01:18:11.645 --> 01:18:15.816
C'mon, let's go home... Come on...

01:18:15.983 --> 01:18:17.318
Stop it!

01:18:28.913 --> 01:18:30.122
Sachi...

01:18:37.004 --> 01:18:38.130
I'm sorry.

01:18:40.925 --> 01:18:42.009
See you soon.

01:18:56.357 --> 01:18:59.193
Sachi, I love you.

01:19:00.194 --> 01:19:03.030
Uncle!

01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:20.232
Which one is the target?
Right or left?

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:23.068
Just pick one and shoot!

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:26.572
Go right! Go right!

01:24:07.793 --> 01:24:09.419
You never change.

01:24:09.878 --> 01:24:12.756
You can't stop the war like this.

01:24:17.386 --> 01:24:18.804
This isn't a war...

01:24:19.638 --> 01:24:20.638
It's justice!

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:34.319
Still want my blood?

01:24:38.323 --> 01:24:39.783
Come and get it!

01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:28.280
Sachi...

01:29:29.781 --> 01:29:30.907
You good?

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:32.032
Uncle!

01:29:32.617 --> 01:29:34.244
Are you OK?

01:29:34.661 --> 01:29:35.745
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:40.584
Sachi.

01:29:41.793 --> 01:29:43.086
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:29:44.296 --> 01:29:45.922
I need you to hang tight.

01:29:48.717 --> 01:29:51.261
Uncle?

01:30:03.273 --> 01:30:07.110
<i>All of this was a trap to bring you
within my reach.</i>

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:09.988
You've done well so far.

01:30:10.155 --> 01:30:14.117
But how are you going to
fight with wounds like that?

01:30:18.997 --> 01:30:21.666
You're not Ghost anymore.

01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:25.503
You're just a spectre with no name.

01:30:26.588 --> 01:30:30.175
Nobody remembers who you used to be.

01:30:34.012 --> 01:30:35.180
You're nothing.

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:38.808
What do you have to live for now?

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:45.190
You really think you brought me here?

01:30:48.944 --> 01:30:50.987
Now I've got you in front of me.

01:30:51.863 --> 01:30:53.365
That's all that matters.

01:31:06.211 --> 01:31:08.338
Are you still thirsty for my blood?

01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:11.716
I've got bad news, old man.

01:31:13.051 --> 01:31:15.220
My blood's run dry!

01:31:20.058 --> 01:31:21.559
So...

01:31:22.769 --> 01:31:25.689
you really are the legend himself.

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:36.574
Toshiro...

01:31:37.826 --> 01:31:40.578
Why did you save that little girl?

01:31:42.664 --> 01:31:44.082
Why did you...

01:31:44.499 --> 01:31:48.211
Why did you kill your old buddy Abyss?

01:31:50.672 --> 01:31:52.257
Why...

01:31:54.759 --> 01:31:56.428
Why?

01:31:57.262 --> 01:32:00.932
Why did you subject Kenji
to that living hell?

01:32:02.851 --> 01:32:04.561
Why?

01:32:06.604 --> 01:32:08.106
Why?

01:32:10.275 --> 01:32:15.739
Why do you fight?

01:32:17.407 --> 01:32:19.242
Why?

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:23.121
Why?

01:32:25.457 --> 01:32:26.791
Why?

01:32:27.292 --> 01:32:28.626
Why?

01:32:30.545 --> 01:32:31.545
Why?

01:32:32.756 --> 01:32:33.756
Why...

01:32:34.799 --> 01:32:39.137
Are you so determined to live?

01:32:59.115 --> 01:33:00.617
You talky old fuck...

01:33:02.327 --> 01:33:03.995
I'm not alive.

01:33:04.496 --> 01:33:07.123
I died a long time ago.

01:33:46.204 --> 01:33:48.832
Sorry, Sachi...

01:33:50.708 --> 01:33:55.839
Your dad's not gonna be able
to pretend to sleep tonight...

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:34.586
<i>There is only so much
we can do in this world.</i>

01:34:35.336 --> 01:34:39.257
<i>It doesn't matter
how great you think you are...</i>

01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:45.263
<i>When we lose our footing,
we can only think of ourselves.</i>

01:34:45.847 --> 01:34:50.894
<i>And that makes the world
a colder and sadder place.</i>

01:34:52.604 --> 01:34:54.397
<i>But in our darkest hours...</i>

01:34:54.772 --> 01:34:59.277
<i>We need imagination to
look towards a brighter future,</i>

01:34:59.611 --> 01:35:03.239
<i>and pray God sends us
someone who can turn the tide.</i>

01:35:04.032 --> 01:35:08.119
<i>Someone to light a fire in our hearts,
then disappear,</i>

01:35:08.786 --> 01:35:12.749
<i>inspiring us to change the world ourselves.</i>

01:35:14.125 --> 01:35:15.293
<i>And now...</i>

01:35:15.627 --> 01:35:20.131
<i>I stand on the edge of the world,
relying on the beacon</i>

01:35:21.341 --> 01:35:24.802
<i>that will guide me to a better future</i>

01:35:25.637 --> 01:35:28.973
<i>One that I will see
through with my own eyes.</i>

01:35:29.305 --> 01:35:35.662
