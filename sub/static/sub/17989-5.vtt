00:05.697 --> 00:12.296
Only one creature has carved a life
for itself in every habitat on Earth.

00:13.537 --> 00:17.132
That creature is us.

00:18.137 --> 00:24.053
All over the world we still use our
ingenuity to survive in the wild places,

00:24.097 --> 00:29.615
far from the city lights,
face to face with raw nature.

00:31.497 --> 00:34.853
This is the Human Planet.

00:46.457 --> 00:51.212
Mountains are among
the most brutal environments on Earth.

00:54.297 --> 00:59.610
Weather here can shift
from tropical to arctic in just hours.

01:03.817 --> 01:06.854
And the higher you climb,
the tougher it gets...

01:08.057 --> 01:11.367
...until even oxygen is stripped away.

01:16.257 --> 01:19.647
But millions of people
live in the mountains...

01:23.897 --> 01:27.651
...either seeking refuge from conflict

01:27.697 --> 01:31.451
or exploiting resources
found nowhere else.

01:34.977 --> 01:37.537
And to survive they have had to adapt

01:37.577 --> 01:41.047
in the most surprising and ingenious ways.

01:43.497 --> 01:46.569
These are their stories.

02:26.057 --> 02:31.893
The Altai mountains in Mongolia
are among the most remote on Earth.

02:35.137 --> 02:39.130
And for the people
who live in this barren landscape,

02:39.177 --> 02:43.534
hunting is nearly impossible.

02:43.577 --> 02:46.649
Unless you have help.

02:51.497 --> 02:55.888
Sailau Jadik and his son Berik
are Kazakhs.

02:55.937 --> 03:00.806
And today they're in search
of the ultimate hunting partner.

03:02.177 --> 03:04.566
A golden eagle.

03:19.897 --> 03:23.856
These young birds
are almost ready to leave the nest.

03:27.537 --> 03:32.372
If 16-year-old Berik can collect one,
he will take his first step

03:32.417 --> 03:35.932
towards becoming a Kazakh hunter
like his father.

03:38.977 --> 03:41.013
It's a big first step.

04:16.817 --> 04:21.891
Ever since the Kazakhs fled
into these mountains nearly 200 years ago,

04:21.937 --> 04:24.656
they have been stealing baby eagles.

04:31.777 --> 04:35.929
Eagles have eyes many times
more powerful than a human's

04:35.977 --> 04:38.810
and can spot prey
two kilometres away.

04:40.777 --> 04:43.814
If Berik can teach this eagle
to hunt for him,

04:43.857 --> 04:49.329
he will join the few hundred Kazakhs left
who can still do this.

05:02.857 --> 05:07.408
Berik calls his new eagle Balapan.

05:09.257 --> 05:13.808
If he gets it right,
Balapan will become his hunting partner.

05:16.737 --> 05:20.571
But training her will take five months.

05:34.297 --> 05:39.291
It's five months later, and time
for Berik and a fully grown Balapan

05:39.337 --> 05:41.976
to go on their first hunt together.

05:44.937 --> 05:48.009
They're after a Mongolian fox,

05:48.057 --> 05:54.530
an animal so elusive, only an eagle
stands a chance of catching it.

05:59.737 --> 06:05.494
But for Balapan to catch the fox, Berik
first has to take her to high ground.

06:08.857 --> 06:14.090
Here she'll have the perfect vantage point
to spot the slightest movement.

06:42.817 --> 06:47.845
Berik now hopes that Balapan's
hunting instinct will take over.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.617
Balapan has failed.

07:42.377 --> 07:44.766
For Berik, this is worrying.

07:44.817 --> 07:47.650
Does she have the killer instinct?

08:00.657 --> 08:05.094
Traditionally, Kazakh hunters
pair up with their eagles for seven years

08:05.137 --> 08:07.810
before setting them free,

08:07.857 --> 08:10.655
but Berik now has his doubts.

08:38.417 --> 08:42.774
As day breaks,
father and son return to the mountains.

08:46.457 --> 08:48.925
If Balapan can't catch a fox,

08:48.977 --> 08:54.051
Berik may have to let her go
and find another eagle to train.

09:58.057 --> 10:02.653
Balapan has caught the fox,
just as she was trained to.

10:03.737 --> 10:06.809
She's now locked
in a fight to the death.

10:37.337 --> 10:40.647
Sailau kills the fox as quickly as he can.

10:44.817 --> 10:49.891
According to Kazakh tradition,
Balapan gets the fox's lungs.

10:53.137 --> 10:57.653
The fox's thick coat
will be used for winter clothing.

11:01.377 --> 11:07.407
Berik has proved himself
to be a successful Kazakh hunter.

11:26.737 --> 11:30.047
As long as they have lived
in the Altai Mountains,

11:30.097 --> 11:32.850
Kazakhs have relied on eagles.

11:36.017 --> 11:41.455
However, not all mountain people
get help from wild animals.

11:43.217 --> 11:46.687
On the edge of Africa's Great Rift Valley,

11:46.737 --> 11:51.731
geological upheaval has created
Ethiopia's Simien mountains.

11:54.017 --> 11:57.805
Here, giant cliffs form a natural fortress

11:57.857 --> 12:02.533
where for centuries people
have sought refuge from conflicts below.

12:07.097 --> 12:11.852
Getabit village is one of a hundred
perched in a landscape so vertical

12:11.897 --> 12:16.413
that the residents can only grow
their crops on tiny strips of land

12:16.457 --> 12:18.288
along the edges of cliffs.

12:26.217 --> 12:30.813
But 700-foot precipices
are the least of their worries.

12:30.857 --> 12:34.247
Today their annual harvest is under way,

12:34.297 --> 12:38.768
and their grain is under attack
from a ravenous enemy.

12:45.737 --> 12:51.414
These are gelada monkeys
and they love stealing the farmers'grain.

12:53.537 --> 13:00.056
Troops of up to 600 prowl the cliffs
surrounding Getabit village,

13:00.097 --> 13:03.851
led by males with fangs
larger than a lion's.

13:06.217 --> 13:08.208
They are cunning thieves.

13:09.217 --> 13:12.095
To defend their crops against the monkeys,

13:12.137 --> 13:18.212
the cliff farmers depend on their
children, such as 1 2-year-old Dereje.

13:44.497 --> 13:49.890
Because the area is next to
a national park, the gelada are protected.

14:08.977 --> 14:12.890
As night approaches,
the geladas stop raiding.

14:18.737 --> 14:23.208
But Dereje's crops are ripe for harvest,
and he knows that tomorrow

14:23.257 --> 14:26.454
the monkeys will attack
even more aggressively than before.

14:26.497 --> 14:32.174
So, with his two sisters and brother,
he camps by his fields.

14:55.897 --> 14:59.936
At night, temperatures
plummet below freezing.

15:01.417 --> 15:05.376
While the thick-furred geladas
have adapted to the cold,

15:05.417 --> 15:08.489
the humans
must huddle together for warmth.

15:13.417 --> 15:16.534
At dawn, the geladas attack.

15:22.097 --> 15:28.252
The first strike comes from a few large
males, who target Dereje's haystacks.

15:28.297 --> 15:31.130
He drives them off,

15:31.177 --> 15:35.693
but the geladas are cunning -
these males were only a decoy.

15:40.697 --> 15:43.894
Out of sight
at the other end of Dereje's fields,

15:43.937 --> 15:47.486
the main army launches the real attack.

15:49.177 --> 15:53.090
A big troop like this
can strip a field in minutes.

16:20.857 --> 16:22.336
If Dereje doesn't hurry,

16:22.377 --> 16:27.770
the food his family needs
to get through the winter will be gone.

16:56.177 --> 17:00.807
Dereje's done it.
He's seen off the gelada.

17:03.177 --> 17:06.692
Finally, his crops are harvested.

17:29.937 --> 17:31.973
Dereje lives in the Simiens

17:32.017 --> 17:36.329
because his ancestors
sought refuge here centuries ago.

17:36.377 --> 17:40.928
But in some parts of the world,
people settle in mountains

17:40.977 --> 17:46.176
because this environment
has something they desperately want.

17:52.657 --> 17:57.526
Mountains are born
when continental plates collide.

17:59.177 --> 18:04.809
This massive upheaval often exposes
a wealth of valuable minerals.

18:05.817 --> 18:09.412
Nowhere more so than here in Indonesia,

18:09.457 --> 18:14.053
home to more active volcanic mountains
than any nation on Earth.

18:24.017 --> 18:26.212
Here, people risk their lives

18:26.257 --> 18:30.296
for a mineral vital
to several important industries.

18:32.217 --> 18:34.208
Sulphur.

18:36.137 --> 18:39.891
Hartomo and Sulaiman are sulphur miners.

18:41.377 --> 18:45.370
Today they're going where few others dare.

18:47.417 --> 18:50.727
Into the heart of an active volcano.

19:10.417 --> 19:15.650
This is Ijen crater, one of the most
poisonous places on Earth.

19:17.857 --> 19:23.966
At its centre, a lake filled with
two-and-a-half million tonnes of acid.

19:31.537 --> 19:35.371
And out of the depths of the mountain
pour toxic gases

19:35.417 --> 19:40.411
that have claimed the lives
of 7 4 miners in the past 40 years.

20:16.417 --> 20:20.808
The hydrogen sulphide
that these men must breathe in

20:20.857 --> 20:23.087
is 40 times the safe level.

20:31.777 --> 20:35.247
Over time, it destroys their lungs.

21:11.057 --> 21:13.366
Once they have enough sulphur,

21:13.417 --> 21:15.885
Hartomo and Sulaiman have to carry it

21:15.937 --> 21:19.293
200 metres straight up to the crater rim.

21:25.617 --> 21:29.246
Each man hefts 90 kilos,

21:29.297 --> 21:32.812
nearly one-and-a-half times
their own body weight.

21:36.977 --> 21:41.255
This work exacts a heavy price
on the miners'bodies.

22:15.417 --> 22:20.445
Sulaiman and Hartomo
are paid five dollars per load.

22:22.457 --> 22:26.416
The lives of miners have always been hard.

22:28.057 --> 22:30.855
But it's not just miners
who have it tough.

22:30.897 --> 22:35.288
For some mountain dwellers,
just finding food can be a challenge.

22:38.337 --> 22:44.526
In the South Pacific lies the world's
second largest island, New Guinea.

22:47.577 --> 22:52.810
This is one of the most biologically rich
mountain landscapes on Earth.

22:54.297 --> 22:58.210
With plenty of water,
and thousands of protected valleys,

22:58.257 --> 23:01.010
these mountains brim with life.

23:04.057 --> 23:09.085
Yet hunting for food, and in particular
meat, is surprisingly difficult.

23:17.617 --> 23:20.415
Marcus, Andrew and George are hunters

23:20.457 --> 23:23.176
from the Yangoru Boiken tribe.

23:23.217 --> 23:27.972
They and their families haven't eaten
any fresh meat for two weeks.

23:29.737 --> 23:32.490
But today they plan to solve the problem.

23:37.297 --> 23:41.131
They hope to trap giant fruit bats.

24:02.337 --> 24:07.411
But to catch a giant bat
requires a giant bat trap.

24:09.937 --> 24:13.407
So these men are doing something radical.

24:13.457 --> 24:16.972
They're changing the shape
of the landscape itself.

24:22.977 --> 24:28.335
Along this ridge,
the men create a 70-foot wide doorway.

24:28.377 --> 24:33.974
A shortcut through the mountains
to the fruit trees beyond

24:34.017 --> 24:37.054
and a perfect place to ambush the bats.

25:03.937 --> 25:07.976
Like spiders,
the men spin a gigantic web.

25:11.697 --> 25:18.011
In the dark, this 1 30-foot high net
cannot be detected by the bats.

25:21.977 --> 25:24.889
Only two things now remain.

25:27.697 --> 25:29.653
Add the bat alert signal...

25:31.737 --> 25:33.967
...and pray the bats fly into their trap.

25:51.177 --> 25:54.533
Catching bats requires patience.

25:58.017 --> 26:01.407
In the past,
Marcus has spent weeks on the mountain

26:01.457 --> 26:03.971
and come home empty-handed.

26:06.297 --> 26:11.610
But if he does manage to catch
even a few, the effort will be worthwhile.

26:58.457 --> 27:02.530
It's a good start,
but with all the mouths to feed at home,

27:02.577 --> 27:05.330
they're going to need more than one bat.

27:10.617 --> 27:14.895
As the hours roll on,
their trap continues to catch bats.

27:20.737 --> 27:25.128
In the course of the night,
the men catch a total of 1 5 bats.

27:26.817 --> 27:30.571
They cook two now and save the rest.

27:33.377 --> 27:38.576
Their haul will provide their families
with enough protein for two weeks.

27:46.097 --> 27:49.373
Every part of the bat is edible,
down to the leather on the wings.

27:59.457 --> 28:01.527
For Andrew, Marcus and George,

28:01.577 --> 28:04.614
knowing every inch
of their mountain habitat

28:04.657 --> 28:07.535
enables them to feed their families.

28:13.017 --> 28:17.454
But in colder climes,
knowing every inch of your mountain

28:17.497 --> 28:21.046
can mean the difference
between life and death.

28:25.137 --> 28:29.653
In the Swiss Alps,
ten metres of snow can fall in a year.

28:36.897 --> 28:41.573
And for millions of skiers,
this is a brilliant reason to come here.

28:48.977 --> 28:52.970
But heavy snowfalls
can also pose a deadly threat.

28:55.617 --> 28:57.289
Avalanches.

29:12.737 --> 29:15.410
Travelling faster than a bullet train,

29:15.457 --> 29:19.769
a major avalanche
annihilates everything in its path.

29:21.617 --> 29:23.016
In any given winter,

29:23.057 --> 29:27.573
there can be 30,000 avalanches
in the Swiss Alps alone.

29:47.297 --> 29:51.256
Ski patrolman Martin Mathys
is an avalanche spotter.

29:51.297 --> 29:53.572
And today he has a big problem.

29:55.577 --> 30:00.810
In his hometown of Grindelwald,
there has been a massive snowfall.

30:00.857 --> 30:03.815
The risk of avalanche is now extreme.

30:36.777 --> 30:39.575
Towering 1,000 metres above Grindelwald

30:39.617 --> 30:42.256
is the notorious Black Horn ridge.

30:44.297 --> 30:48.529
Packed with snow,
it's a disaster waiting to happen.

30:49.737 --> 30:53.013
So Martin must set off
a controlled avalanche now

30:53.057 --> 30:55.696
before any more snow falls.

31:11.257 --> 31:16.456
To set off a controlled avalanche,
you need dynamite, plenty of it.

31:18.097 --> 31:24.127
Martin is taking 50 kilos,
enough to blow up several city blocks.

32:02.097 --> 32:06.648
Martin reaches the summit of
the Black Horn ridge, and sets a charge.

32:27.697 --> 32:33.010
He triggers a mini avalanche,
shifting over ten tonnes of snow.

32:33.057 --> 32:37.255
But it's not enough.
He needs to go again.

33:08.977 --> 33:11.537
This time, Martin succeeds.

33:11.577 --> 33:16.014
This is the avalanche he needs
to make the mountain safe.

33:33.777 --> 33:36.894
High in the Alps,
mountain people have learnt

33:36.937 --> 33:41.135
to control the threat of avalanches
with modern technology.

33:42.217 --> 33:47.530
But there are mountains where
the forces of nature cannot be tamed.

33:53.257 --> 33:56.886
The Himalaya
is the highest mountain range on Earth.

33:59.177 --> 34:02.931
The world's tallest hundred mountains
are all here.

34:09.617 --> 34:14.293
And within these peaks
live 70 million people...

34:15.417 --> 34:20.127
...many at altitudes
that pose a threat to the human body.

34:26.297 --> 34:31.769
In the Doramba region of Nepal,
the residents face an insidious threat.

34:35.257 --> 34:40.331
Dangerously high levels of harmful
UVrays pierce the thin mountain air

34:40.377 --> 34:42.607
and burn people's eyes.

34:48.337 --> 34:50.567
And here in the village of Balau,

34:50.617 --> 34:54.530
65-year-old Teteeni
has paid a heavy price.

34:55.977 --> 34:57.296
She's blind.

35:24.097 --> 35:28.966
Teteeni is determined not to let blindness
interfere with her life,

35:29.017 --> 35:33.329
but simple tasks, such as fetching water,
now take longer

35:33.377 --> 35:35.208
and can be treacherous.

35:42.577 --> 35:45.649
Her blindness is caused by cataracts,

35:45.697 --> 35:51.010
a fogging of her lenses
exacerbated by the intense mountain sun.

35:53.497 --> 35:57.251
But isolated here in the Himalaya

35:57.297 --> 36:01.176
Teteeni has no access
to medical treatment.

36:06.177 --> 36:10.853
Fortunately, an answer to her prayers
may be just around the corner.

36:13.057 --> 36:14.456
From Kathmandu,

36:14.497 --> 36:18.376
Dr Sanduk Ruit has pioneered
a method of eye surgery

36:18.417 --> 36:22.012
that he brings to the remote corners
of the Himalaya.

36:26.537 --> 36:31.053
His mobile clinic
brings hope to thousands.

36:37.777 --> 36:41.656
And today,
Teteeni is setting off to join them.

36:47.897 --> 36:50.934
She has arranged
for the only transportation

36:50.977 --> 36:53.491
available to her in these mountains.

36:53.537 --> 36:59.214
A friend has offered to carry her
ten kilometres to the Doramba clinic.

37:06.377 --> 37:11.576
While Dr Ruit's success rate is high,
there is still a strong chance

37:11.617 --> 37:15.656
that Teteeni's eyes
are too far gone to be saved.

37:17.177 --> 37:19.088
He makes no promises.

37:38.737 --> 37:43.049
Doramba's schoolhouse
is now an improvised operating theatre.

37:47.697 --> 37:54.011
It takes Dr Ruit just half an hour
to remove Teteeni's fogged lenses.

37:54.057 --> 37:56.013
He then replaces them

37:56.057 --> 38:00.494
with a synthetic lens
he manufactures himself.

38:02.417 --> 38:07.286
In the West,
this operation could cost $8,000.

38:09.697 --> 38:15.055
But, funded by charity, Dr Ruit doesn't
charge his patients a single rupee.

38:18.217 --> 38:22.972
With surgery now complete,
Teteeni can only wait.

38:37.417 --> 38:42.730
Just 24 hours after her operation,
Teteeni joins hundreds of patients

38:42.777 --> 38:48.488
waiting to have their bandages removed,
hopefully with her sight restored.

38:56.297 --> 39:00.210
For Teteeni, this is the moment of truth.

39:42.177 --> 39:47.649
For the first time in three years,
Teteeni can see.

40:28.297 --> 40:30.288
In the Himalayan foothills,

40:30.337 --> 40:35.457
modern medicine is helping prolong
the lives of the people who live here.

40:42.017 --> 40:45.134
But, as you climb higher
in these mountains,

40:45.177 --> 40:48.613
it's how to deal with death
that poses a problem.

40:57.897 --> 41:00.457
At over 4,000 metres,

41:00.497 --> 41:04.172
Dho Tarap is one of
the highest communities on Earth.

41:09.897 --> 41:13.970
Buddhists live here
in almost complete isolation.

41:19.217 --> 41:22.254
And when someone dies at this altitude,

41:22.297 --> 41:25.334
dealing with the corpse
is a real challenge.

41:29.417 --> 41:33.171
Last night
there was a death in the village.

41:36.897 --> 41:40.651
70-year-old Nombe-la passed away,

41:40.697 --> 41:45.009
and now his family are preparing his body
for a Buddhist funeral.

41:51.137 --> 41:56.006
The man in charge of this funeral
is Holy Lama Namgyal.

42:19.897 --> 42:23.776
Lama Namgyal
needs to hold the funeral soon

42:23.817 --> 42:28.766
because Nombe-la's corpse could attract
predators and spread disease.

42:31.417 --> 42:35.933
But when you live at the roof
of the world, your options are limited.

42:37.537 --> 42:41.291
Buddhists don't bury their dead.

42:45.217 --> 42:50.610
And at this altitude no trees grow,
so there is no wood for a cremation.

42:54.897 --> 43:00.369
The solution is a sacred ritual
older than Buddhism itself.

43:04.137 --> 43:06.697
A sky burial.

43:15.697 --> 43:18.609
To conduct the sky burial ritual,

43:18.657 --> 43:22.570
Lama Namgyal
needs the help of a specialist.

43:28.377 --> 43:31.767
Bharmay Furba is the undertaker.

43:34.657 --> 43:37.535
As a non-Buddhist, he is the only one

43:37.577 --> 43:41.809
who is allowed to carry out
this most difficult task.

44:16.217 --> 44:20.768
The funeral procession heads
an hour-and-a-half up into the mountains

44:20.817 --> 44:24.605
to a sacred ledge
where sky burials have been performed

44:24.657 --> 44:27.410
for over 1,000 years.

44:31.497 --> 44:33.374
Here, they will rendezvous

44:33.417 --> 44:37.535
with the most efficient scavengers
in these mountains.

44:39.777 --> 44:41.688
Vultures.

44:49.177 --> 44:50.815
For millennia,

44:50.857 --> 44:54.770
Buddhists in these mountains
have relied on the griffon vulture

44:54.817 --> 44:57.650
and the lammergeier
to help them dispose of their dead.

45:02.137 --> 45:07.609
These birds swiftly consume a corpse
before it can spread disease.

45:11.177 --> 45:13.611
Buddhists see this as a sacred act,

45:13.657 --> 45:17.696
an offering that will sustain the life
of another being.

45:23.537 --> 45:27.928
For them, Nombe-la's corpse
is now an empty vessel.

45:29.897 --> 45:33.094
His soul has already migrated
to another realm.

45:45.257 --> 45:49.728
Nombe-la's sons pay their final respects
to their father.

45:52.337 --> 45:57.286
But they don't wish to be present
for what is about to take place.

45:57.337 --> 46:02.695
Because, in order for the vultures
to consume Nombe-la's corpse quickly,

46:02.737 --> 46:05.649
Bharmay must make it easier for them.

47:29.297 --> 47:34.610
Nombe-la's corpse has now gone
and cannot spread disease.

48:27.737 --> 48:32.686
To survive in the mountains,
you have to understand them.

48:39.497 --> 48:43.649
Mountain habitats can be brutal

48:43.697 --> 48:49.055
but if you use
your ingenuity, determination,

48:49.097 --> 48:52.487
resourcefulness and courage

48:52.537 --> 48:56.530
it is possible to make a life here
at the roof of the world.

49:14.977 --> 49:20.449
When the Human Planet mountains team
filmed the Mongolian eagle hunters,

49:20.497 --> 49:24.695
their search for a fox was like
finding a needle in a haystack.

49:24.737 --> 49:27.934
Keeping up with the hunters
also proved near impossible

49:27.977 --> 49:30.491
in the vast Mongolian landscape.

49:35.337 --> 49:39.330
The team are here
to film Sailau and his son Berik

49:39.377 --> 49:41.766
hunting with their eagle, Balapan.

49:43.457 --> 49:48.326
Cameraman Keith Partridge last met Berik
in June with his newborn chick.

49:49.537 --> 49:54.008
It's now November and bitterly cold -
an ideal time for hunting,

49:54.057 --> 49:58.289
when wolves, foxes and rabbits
all have thick winter coats.

49:59.697 --> 50:01.289
Unlike the wildlife,

50:01.337 --> 50:05.376
the old Russian trucks
are not well adapted to the cold

50:05.417 --> 50:08.409
so the drivers devise a novel solution.

50:10.657 --> 50:13.217
Keith opts for a different ride.

50:13.257 --> 50:14.690
The fact is

50:14.737 --> 50:18.207
that I haven't even ridden a donkey
across Blackpool beach.

50:18.257 --> 50:19.895
And we've now got to go up there

50:19.937 --> 50:21.529
on one of these.

50:21.577 --> 50:23.568
Does my horse have a name?

50:23.617 --> 50:25.972
They don't have names?

50:28.617 --> 50:31.609
The Mongolians have more than 300 words

50:31.657 --> 50:34.410
just to describe the horse colours.

50:34.457 --> 50:35.446
Wow!

50:35.497 --> 50:40.651
You know that to make it go,
you slightly kick and you should say,

50:40.697 --> 50:42.767
- "Shu!"
- OK, shall we follow Agii?

50:42.817 --> 50:44.330
Thank you.

50:44.377 --> 50:46.174
That's it. Shu!

50:46.217 --> 50:48.048
Shu!

50:49.217 --> 50:51.128
Shu!

50:51.177 --> 50:55.250
Eventually Keith finds the gears
and off he goes.

50:58.577 --> 51:01.569
After three hours, the trucks catch up,

51:01.617 --> 51:04.370
and Keith's only too happy
to leave his horse behind.

51:07.577 --> 51:08.692
What does he think?

51:16.617 --> 51:18.653
Except my nose?

51:18.697 --> 51:20.449
Is it too big?

51:25.937 --> 51:28.690
There you go, no frostbite!

51:31.777 --> 51:34.849
Keith heads off
to test a small "eagle-cam';

51:34.897 --> 51:38.333
for which Sailau has made a harness.

51:39.417 --> 51:43.296
There are cameras out there that
might give us a better picture quality

51:43.337 --> 51:44.929
but they're much bigger

51:44.977 --> 51:48.174
so we're playing this trade-off game
all the time

51:48.217 --> 51:50.685
between practicalities and quality.

51:50.737 --> 51:52.967
Anyway, we'll see how it goes.

51:56.417 --> 52:01.775
Sailau's eagle seems to fly quite happily
with the eagle-cam on her back.

52:01.817 --> 52:06.891
Encouraged by the first test,
they use a heavier high-definition camera.

52:08.697 --> 52:10.494
This will be amazing if this works.

52:10.537 --> 52:13.210
We don't even know
if the bird will take the weight.

52:13.257 --> 52:16.772
We might have overloaded the plane,
so to speak.

52:22.257 --> 52:26.648
The eagle flies beautifully.
Keith and the team head back to base,

52:26.697 --> 52:30.133
joining director Nic Brown
to view the results.

52:30.177 --> 52:31.690
It's a very tense moment.

52:31.737 --> 52:35.286
The locals join in for a bird's-eye view.

52:35.337 --> 52:39.125
They've never seen their eagles
quite like this before.

52:39.177 --> 52:40.735
- The hood's off!
- Hood's off.

52:40.777 --> 52:43.689
Off we go. Whoa!

52:43.737 --> 52:47.810
- How small, my God. Really wild!
- Look at his head!

52:52.297 --> 52:54.857
Wow, look at that banking round
with the head.

52:54.897 --> 52:59.527
Wow! That's pretty wicked, isn't it.

53:01.697 --> 53:02.732
The next day,

53:02.777 --> 53:07.089
the crew follow Berik and his young eagle
on their first fox hunt.

53:07.137 --> 53:09.207
The hunters shadow sweepers -

53:09.257 --> 53:13.091
men who flush the foxes
out into the open.

53:14.257 --> 53:17.249
The team must constantly move
from peak to peak

53:17.297 --> 53:20.050
to give the eagles the best chance
of seeing a fox.

53:20.097 --> 53:23.169
Sailau thinks that the fox
might be hiding

53:23.217 --> 53:27.335
over these small mounds
just behind these telegraph lines.

53:27.377 --> 53:31.211
He would like to go to one of those hills
and wait there.

53:31.257 --> 53:34.169
It seems to make sense
that we've got to head there.

53:34.217 --> 53:36.606
Well, you'd better be fast, mate,
cos he's just gone.

53:36.657 --> 53:37.646
There he goes.

53:40.657 --> 53:45.572
After packing up quickly,
the film crew race after the hunters.

53:46.617 --> 53:51.213
But as soon as Keith starts filming,
the plans seem to change yet again.

53:52.257 --> 53:55.727
Sailau's now moved off again
so, er, time to go.

53:55.777 --> 53:57.972
We've only been here for two minutes.

53:59.257 --> 54:01.612
This set the pattern of the day.

54:01.657 --> 54:05.332
As Sailau and Berik
move from peak to peak,

54:05.377 --> 54:11.088
so do the team, constantly playing
catch-up in the thin high-altitude air.

54:11.137 --> 54:15.176
Finally, near exhaustion,
they face a new problem.

54:17.457 --> 54:19.334
Where is Sailau?

54:20.497 --> 54:22.692
They call the director.

54:22.737 --> 54:25.535
Nic, Nic. This is Keith,
do you read? Over.

54:25.577 --> 54:27.613
Hi, yeah, how are you?

54:27.657 --> 54:32.526
We're on our third mountain range
of the day so far and still no luck, over.

54:32.577 --> 54:35.728
Which mountain range
are you on now? Over.

54:37.937 --> 54:39.529
If only we knew!

54:39.577 --> 54:42.649
Behind us are the really big peaks
with no snow on.

54:42.697 --> 54:44.892
The terrain here is pretty wild, actually,

54:44.937 --> 54:47.212
and if anything's
going to be lurking about,

54:47.257 --> 54:50.329
I think I'd want to hide
around here somewhere.

54:50.377 --> 54:53.289
Something's in front
of that telegraph pole. Is that a dog?

54:53.337 --> 54:54.565
Let's get the lens on it.

55:00.057 --> 55:01.729
It's not a wolf, it's a cow!

55:01.777 --> 55:04.814
I never said it was a wolf,
I said it was moving.

55:04.857 --> 55:05.846
That is very true!

55:05.897 --> 55:08.650
Do I get the sense that delirium

55:08.697 --> 55:12.372
is beginning to set in
on the third mountain range of the day?

55:12.417 --> 55:14.806
Would you like some chocolate bars?

55:14.857 --> 55:20.011
Agii, every day, just at the point
where we are about to faint...

55:22.657 --> 55:25.125
You bust your teeth on them!

55:25.177 --> 55:29.216
I could ask you, Agii, if you could
keep them somewhere slightly warmer!

55:35.857 --> 55:37.768
They set off yet again.

55:37.817 --> 55:42.572
Keith and the team are beginning to wonder
if they'll ever film a hunt.

55:42.617 --> 55:44.812
But then, good news.

55:44.857 --> 55:46.609
We have seen a fox.

55:47.617 --> 55:50.131
It scarpered really fast
down that snowy slope.

55:50.177 --> 55:52.213
The guys are over there at the moment,

55:52.257 --> 55:54.851
trying to see where it's hunkered down.

55:54.897 --> 55:56.535
Once they're out on the snow,

55:56.577 --> 55:59.808
you can see them pretty easily cos it's
a little black dot, scarpering like hell.

55:59.857 --> 56:03.008
But, um, apart from that,
you see this place.

56:03.057 --> 56:07.016
It's utterly vast. It's like trying
to find a needle in a haystack.

56:07.057 --> 56:11.767
Suddenly there's a call from the valley
and the hunt is on.

56:13.057 --> 56:15.491
Everybody clear the front of frame,
please.

56:15.537 --> 56:16.526
Now!

56:34.657 --> 56:37.774
I think the fox
has made a hasty escape.

56:39.137 --> 56:43.096
Both Balapan and the crew
have learned a lot on their first hunt.

56:45.497 --> 56:49.092
Still...the team
have yet to film a successful hunt.

56:49.137 --> 56:54.575
After several frustrating days,
the pressure to deliver is intense.

56:56.897 --> 57:01.573
We're fast running out of time, really.
It hasn't been looking very good.

57:01.617 --> 57:05.815
Just when the crew
are resigned to failure, a call is heard.

57:08.457 --> 57:14.612
Keith knows this is his and Balapan's
big chance to succeed.

57:42.337 --> 57:44.612
The bird got it! My word.

57:46.777 --> 57:48.290
When all those whoops go off,

57:48.337 --> 57:53.650
things just go from nought to a million
miles an hour in two or three seconds.

57:53.697 --> 57:57.053
Your heart races
when you are doing this sort of stuff,

57:57.097 --> 57:59.088
and you just have to respond
in a kind of a positive way.

57:59.137 --> 58:03.415
You know, just try and stay totally
focused on what you are here to do.

58:03.457 --> 58:06.767
When that adrenaline kicks in,
it's easy to get distracted,

58:06.817 --> 58:08.409
but you have to just think,

58:08.457 --> 58:10.527
"Right, now is the time
I've got to up my game,

58:10.577 --> 58:15.048
"really knuckle down and focus in
on getting the shot and making it work."

58:15.097 --> 58:18.055
And also trying to build
some form of relationship

58:18.097 --> 58:20.372
with the people
that you are working with as well.

58:20.417 --> 58:21.816
So that they trust us

58:21.857 --> 58:26.373
and welcome us into what's
quite an intimate part of their lives.
