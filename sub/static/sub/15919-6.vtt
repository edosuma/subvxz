Previously on Being Mary Jane.

00:03.687 --> 00:04.896
Well,
if you're a regular viewer,

00:04.927 --> 00:07.560
you're likely aware of the tragic
death of Terrence Mitchell.

00:07.592 --> 00:09.621
This is where you will sit
when you do the interview.

00:09.644 --> 00:10.894
If I do the interview.

00:10.910 --> 00:13.355
(Lisa) I'm just a little concerned
about some of your choices.

00:13.379 --> 00:16.876
Because I don't choose
to be dateless,

00:16.907 --> 00:18.790
or sexless, or joyless?

00:18.821 --> 00:21.140
We're conducting focus groups
on all our shows.

00:21.142 --> 00:22.557
What about Mary Jane?

00:22.559 --> 00:24.848
If she doesn't test well,
she might lose her job?

00:24.850 --> 00:27.181
This information was given
to you in confidence.

00:27.183 --> 00:29.848
You're a proud Latino.
Congratulations.

00:29.850 --> 00:31.348
What is that supposed to mean?

00:31.350 --> 00:33.889
Once you take the shot,
you'll have 36 hours

00:33.891 --> 00:37.473
until you need to get back here
for the extraction.

00:37.475 --> 00:40.598
(male reporter) For those of you just
joining us, tense situation here as--

00:40.600 --> 00:42.639
it appears to be
a single gunman.

00:42.641 --> 00:44.015
African-American male,

00:44.017 --> 00:46.764
and he is holding a sign
that simply says,

00:46.766 --> 00:49.764
I am being surveilled 24/7.
And that is it.

00:49.766 --> 00:52.098
There has been no report yet
of anyone else

00:52.100 --> 00:53.140
in the vehicle with him,

00:53.142 --> 00:54.681
and we see the gun.

00:54.683 --> 00:58.307
He is holding a silver handgun
to his right temple.

00:58.309 --> 01:00.806
He is clearly a threat
to himself, at this point.

01:00.808 --> 01:04.348
The situation is getting
very desperate and uncertain.

01:04.349 --> 01:06.056
Hello.
- Kara, you watching this?

01:06.058 --> 01:08.390
(Kara) Unfortunately, yes.

01:08.392 --> 01:10.390
Duncan's covering it.
- Who?

01:10.392 --> 01:12.723
Duncan. Remember?
Our city hall guy.

01:12.725 --> 01:14.557
Cute dimples. Nice hair.

01:14.559 --> 01:17.557
Tends to miss the complexities,
but he's always ready to work,

01:17.559 --> 01:18.889
and he's already downtown, so--

01:18.891 --> 01:21.723
Oh, yeah.
Traffic's already bad.

01:21.725 --> 01:24.848
Man, all these guns.

01:24.850 --> 01:26.390
Well, at least he's only

01:26.392 --> 01:28.098
threatening
his own life, you know?

01:28.100 --> 01:29.557
Who is he?

01:29.559 --> 01:30.973
(Kara) All we have
is a name right now.

01:30.975 --> 01:33.015
His name is Brian Ellis.

01:33.017 --> 01:37.098
He works in the Atlanta office
of Durbin, McGee & Marting.

01:37.100 --> 01:39.307
He's a pretty substantial
attorney with the firm.

01:39.309 --> 01:42.056
He represents some major banks.

01:42.058 --> 01:44.473
I'm still trying to find
a way in--some kind of angle.

01:44.475 --> 01:45.681

We got to figure most people

01:45.683 --> 01:46.682

You know, crumbling economy.

01:48.267 --> 01:50.015
Pressures of Wall Street,
blah, blah, blah.

01:50.017 --> 01:51.390
Do you disagree with that?

01:51.392 --> 01:52.723
No, I mean it very well
may be true,

01:52.725 --> 01:55.473
but I always
prefer the personal approach.

01:55.475 --> 01:56.848
This is a man's life here.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.681
(Kara) Look who woke up
feeling all sentimental.

01:58.683 --> 01:59.973
It's not like I'm heartless.

01:59.975 --> 02:01.723
(Kara) Oh, you say
that like it's a bad thing.

[phone beeping]

02:02.933 --> 02:04.098
No, wait. I got to--

02:04.100 --> 02:07.223
I got to go. I'll see you soon.
Bye.

02:07.225 --> 02:08.431
Good morning, Dr. Marrs.

02:08.434 --> 02:09.681

How are we feeling today?

02:09.683 --> 02:11.390
Were you able to prepare
the HCG shot?

02:11.392 --> 02:14.515
Yeah. It's right here.

02:14.517 --> 02:16.390
I'm a little nervous, though.

02:16.392 --> 02:18.390
The needle is a lot bigger
than the others.

02:18.392 --> 02:21.515
You'll be fine. I have all
the confidence in the world.

02:21.517 --> 02:23.390
Now, the sole purpose
of this shot is to trigger

02:23.392 --> 02:24.806
your ovulation cycle,

02:24.808 --> 02:26.806
giving us 36 hours
until your eggs

02:26.808 --> 02:28.973
reach their ideal readiness
for extraction.

02:28.975 --> 02:32.515
Which explains my appointment
tomorrow night at 8:00 p.m.

02:32.517 --> 02:35.223
Trust me. Your eggs' maturity
determines the retrieval time.

02:35.225 --> 02:36.473
Not me.

02:36.475 --> 02:38.432
Any other questions? Concerns?

02:38.434 --> 02:40.557
No, no. I'm good.

02:40.559 --> 02:42.056
Call me if you need me.

02:42.058 --> 02:44.308
Otherwise, I'll see you
in my office tomorrow at 8:00.

02:45.309 --> 02:47.681
Okay.

Am I waiting for you not to have
wanted her in the first place

04:31.850 --> 04:33.681
or her not to be pregnant?

Listen, I can't undo
what's already done.

04:35.766 --> 04:37.348
I know.

04:37.350 --> 04:39.889
I can't, so I've just been
trying to live in the moment.

04:39.891 --> 04:41.265
Okay.

04:41.267 --> 04:44.764
All right. Last night
I had this realization.

04:44.766 --> 04:46.307
I was up late trying
to put the crib together--

04:46.309 --> 04:47.390
Really?
- I know,

04:47.392 --> 04:49.723

aspect of my life

04:53.017 --> 04:54.681
for somebody that
I don't even know.

04:54.683 --> 04:56.223
I know. Because you already
love your baby. Got it.

04:56.225 --> 04:59.889
No. I'm not talking about
the baby, and that's my point.

04:59.891 --> 05:01.307
You should have
thought about that

05:01.309 --> 05:02.931
before you got her pregnant.

Mary Jane, I'm just trying
to do the right thing.

to grow up knowing

a father in the house.

05:09.683 --> 05:11.681

I am trying to tell you
I feel trapped.

05:16.933 --> 05:18.681
I'm pretty sure
she feels the same way.

05:18.683 --> 05:20.348
So that's why you're here,
because you feel trapped?

05:20.350 --> 05:21.434
No.

05:23.559 --> 05:25.056
I'm here because
neither one of us

05:25.058 --> 05:26.681
is living the life
we're supposed to be living.

05:26.683 --> 05:28.432
And yet that still
doesn't change the fact

05:28.434 --> 05:30.973
that she's having
your baby, does it?

05:30.975 --> 05:32.848
Does it?

05:32.850 --> 05:35.390
So at this point, I don't really
know what more you want from me.

it's not too late for us.

15:14.017 --> 15:18.223

What's this?

That is everything that you
need to know for the story

21:52.725 --> 21:55.265
and then some.

21:55.267 --> 21:57.390
As I said earlier,
this is your exclusive.

21:57.392 --> 21:58.557
You can do
what you want with it.

21:58.559 --> 22:00.056
All that I ask

22:00.058 --> 22:02.350
is that you keep my name
completely out of it.

22:06.517 --> 22:08.557
You know, I...

22:08.559 --> 22:10.140
had a friend who
committed suicide

22:10.142 --> 22:11.681
a few months ago.

22:11.683 --> 22:12.808
Terrence Mitchell.

22:15.475 --> 22:18.723
The truth is,
this is actually my story.

22:18.725 --> 22:21.267
I started my law career
at that firm.

22:24.683 --> 22:28.015
It's just sad to see
that after 25 years,

22:28.017 --> 22:29.683
nothing really has changed.

22:32.058 --> 22:34.225
So I just said enough is enough.

22:39.100 --> 22:42.432
You're more than
welcome to stay,

for an incredibly...

22:53.683 --> 22:55.889
spirited evening

22:55.891 --> 22:58.183
and for entrusting me with this.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.808
Are you seeing anyone
right now?

23:14.808 --> 23:17.806
I have to leave the country
for a couple of days,

23:17.808 --> 23:20.681
but when I get back,
I'd like to sit down and talk

23:20.683 --> 23:22.223
about you and I
seeing one another

23:22.225 --> 23:25.557
and how that might look.

23:25.559 --> 23:28.307
How does that sound to you?

23:28.309 --> 23:30.683
That sounds like something
I might look forward to.

23:32.392 --> 23:34.098
Okay.

23:34.100 --> 23:35.309
That's settled.

Are you stressed?

24:27.975 --> 24:30.307
Uh, yeah.

24:30.309 --> 24:33.390
No, I mean,

24:33.392 --> 24:35.183
have you ever
thought about suicide?

24:38.058 --> 24:41.806
Killing myself?
- Yeah.

24:41.808 --> 24:45.683
I mean, honestly, Patrick,
I don't know how you do it.

24:47.058 --> 24:48.473
But I--

24:48.475 --> 24:51.515
I love you, okay?

24:51.517 --> 24:55.056
I know you and I have had
our moments, but I do love you,

24:55.058 --> 24:58.098
and if you ever need anyone
to talk to, I'm here.

24:58.100 --> 24:59.764
You are not alone.

24:59.766 --> 25:02.889
Please stop me

You ain't getting
rid of me that easy.

Everything is gonna work
out for you, Patrick.

25:15.267 --> 25:16.934

this more than I do.

You brought me all this stuff?

As we continue to follow
the ongoing investigation

25:25.267 --> 25:27.348
of yesterday's tragic suicide,

25:27.350 --> 25:30.307
evidence has emerged to indicate
that not only were the partners

25:30.309 --> 25:31.806
of Durbin, McGee & Marting

25:31.808 --> 25:35.056
Aware of this proud father
of two's despair,

25:35.058 --> 25:37.848
but that they may have been
the very cause of it.

25:37.850 --> 25:40.681
Seen here in an internal memo,

25:40.683 --> 25:42.681
controlling partner
Wallace Marting states,

25:42.683 --> 25:46.056
and I quote, "Tell him"
to bleeping get over it.

25:46.058 --> 25:48.140
We're all unhappy.
That's just life.

25:48.142 --> 25:50.764
It's not like we can fire him
without Al Sharpton showing up

25:50.766 --> 25:53.223
with a bleeping army
throwing the bleeping race card

25:53.225 --> 25:55.015
in our bleeping faces.

25:55.017 --> 25:56.931
The memo continues on to say,

25:56.933 --> 26:00.223
and again I quote, "Get"
what you can out of the bleep.

26:00.225 --> 26:03.098
I'm sure he's just going
to bleeping quit anyway.

26:03.100 --> 26:04.557
This memo was written

26:04.559 --> 26:08.056
a mere three weeks before
Brian Ellis took his life.

26:08.058 --> 26:10.681
As the authorities determine
whether or not criminal charges

26:10.683 --> 26:12.557
should be filed,
I'd like to turn your attention

26:12.559 --> 26:16.557
to a 2014 study from the Center
for Talent Innovation

26:16.559 --> 26:18.889
which reports
that an alarming 40%

26:18.891 --> 26:21.307
of African-Americans
admit to feeling like outsiders

26:21.309 --> 26:22.931
in the corporate culture,

26:22.933 --> 26:25.889
as compared
to 26% of Caucasians.

26:25.891 --> 26:28.390
And despite corporate America's
ongoing attempts to create

26:28.392 --> 26:30.056
a more diverse work environment,

26:30.058 --> 26:31.432
a staggering 35%

26:31.434 --> 26:32.806
of African-Americans claim

26:32.808 --> 26:35.973
that they need to compromise
their authenticity

26:35.975 --> 26:38.098
in order to conform
to their company's standards

26:38.100 --> 26:41.056
of demeanor or style.

26:41.058 --> 26:43.889
When it comes to issues
of equality in the workplace,

26:43.891 --> 26:46.140
it should never be
about black and white.

26:46.142 --> 26:47.432
It should be about right,

26:47.434 --> 26:50.515
and wrong,
and who's getting the job done.

- I'm just stating the facts.

27:04.183 --> 27:07.015
Yeah, well, your mysterious
source's so-called facts

27:07.017 --> 27:08.848
seem a little too
convenient for me.

27:08.850 --> 27:11.056
They checked out, right?
- Well, yeah, they did,

27:11.058 --> 27:12.889
but, I mean, don't you feel

27:12.891 --> 27:14.681
like there's got to be
more to this story?

27:14.683 --> 27:16.515
Why?
Because you didn't write it?

27:16.517 --> 27:17.848
Excuse me?
- I'm sorry.

27:17.850 --> 27:19.848
I'm just tired of
every move I make

27:19.850 --> 27:22.056

by the entire corporation.

27:22.058 --> 27:25.265
If you're implying that

at this damn network

27:29.434 --> 27:30.848
you are sadly mistaken.

27:30.850 --> 27:33.390
Oh, did they assemble
a secret focus group session

27:33.392 --> 27:35.973
for you as well?

27:35.975 --> 27:37.392
Oh, right.

27:38.725 --> 27:40.392
You thought I didn't know.

27:42.808 --> 27:46.764
I was ordered not to tell you.

27:46.766 --> 27:49.098
I'm sorry, but the last time
I heard that story,

27:49.100 --> 27:50.931
I wound up almost getting fired,

27:50.933 --> 27:52.723
and you wound up
with a promotion.

27:52.725 --> 27:55.764
You know I didn't ask
for any of that stuff with Mark.

27:55.766 --> 27:57.390
And I also know that you
are going through a lot

27:57.392 --> 27:58.931
with this egg freezing,

27:58.933 --> 28:00.764
so I didn't know when
the right time to tell you was.

28:00.766 --> 28:03.390
Ordered not to tell me.

28:03.392 --> 28:06.223
I've been begging Greg
to tell you himself.

28:06.225 --> 28:08.015
I--you know what?

28:08.017 --> 28:09.681
I sound defensive.

28:09.683 --> 28:11.931
Look, I didn't do anything.

28:11.933 --> 28:14.015
I know.

28:14.017 --> 28:16.140
I know.

28:16.142 --> 28:17.434
Not a damn thing.

(Mary Jane) Hey, you.
You watch my show today?

28:23.017 --> 28:25.056
(Val) Well, I've been in
therapy with patients

28:25.058 --> 28:26.265
all afternoon, so--

28:26.267 --> 28:27.764
Ooh, Val, I'm so sorry.

28:27.766 --> 28:29.348
The number came up private.

28:29.350 --> 28:30.764
I thought you were somebody
else. What's up?

28:30.766 --> 28:32.681
(Val) Yeah, I'm sorry
for the random call,

28:32.683 --> 28:36.098
but have you heard
from Lisa recently?

28:36.100 --> 28:38.015
No, not in the last few days.

28:38.017 --> 28:39.973
Well, she left me a message
this morning,

28:39.975 --> 28:41.348
and it was just really strange.

28:41.350 --> 28:43.223
She was going on
about an argument

28:43.225 --> 28:44.681
that the two of you had

28:44.683 --> 28:47.098
and how David
was still in love with you,

28:47.100 --> 28:49.265
and I don't want
to jump to conclusions,

28:49.267 --> 28:50.307
but I'm headed over there.

28:50.309 --> 28:51.931
I've been trying to call her.

28:51.933 --> 28:53.723
She's not answering the phone.
- Okay. I'm on my way.

28:53.725 --> 28:55.017
I'll meet you there.

29:13.975 --> 29:15.764
Don't worry. She's fine.

29:15.766 --> 29:17.473
At least now she is.
- Well, what happened?

29:17.475 --> 29:19.390
Well, she was pretty
disoriented when I got here.

29:19.392 --> 29:21.557
I gave her some meds.
She's upstairs sleeping now.

29:21.559 --> 29:23.181
Okay.

29:23.183 --> 29:25.806
Listen, you've been dealing
with this longer than I have,

29:25.808 --> 29:27.432
and though I'm here as a friend

29:27.434 --> 29:30.265
and not a psychiatrist,
I do need to ask you.

29:30.267 --> 29:32.806
Do you think that she might
be a danger to herself?

29:32.808 --> 29:35.557
Because if you think
that she's suicidal,

29:35.559 --> 29:37.681
then we really should
consider a 5150.

29:37.683 --> 29:40.973
No. No, her career would never
survive a psychiatric hold. No.

29:40.975 --> 29:42.681
Well, don't you think
that being alive

29:42.683 --> 29:44.223
is a little more
important than her career?

29:44.225 --> 29:45.681
Not to Lisa it isn't.
- All right.

29:45.683 --> 29:47.683
Well, what about
when she almost overdosed?

29:49.434 --> 29:52.223
She didn't try
to kill herself, okay?

29:52.225 --> 29:53.681
Maybe she's a little lonely.

29:53.683 --> 29:56.557
A little depressed,
but not suicidal.

29:56.559 --> 29:59.473
How do you even know
about that incident anyway?

29:59.475 --> 30:00.723
David told me...
- Of course.

30:00.725 --> 30:02.848
Of course.
- In confidence.

30:02.850 --> 30:05.848
He was worried, and he wanted
my professional opinion.

30:05.850 --> 30:07.223
That's it.

30:07.225 --> 30:08.473
You ran over here.

30:08.475 --> 30:09.723
Yeah, because you called me.

30:09.725 --> 30:10.889
No. I saw how you drove up--

30:10.891 --> 30:12.515
No, you called me,
and you sounded concerned.

30:12.517 --> 30:14.056
You are scared of something.

30:14.058 --> 30:16.889
What are you scared of?

30:16.891 --> 30:18.223
That's your friend up there.

30:18.225 --> 30:19.723
Maybe she needs help.

30:19.725 --> 30:22.808
I will give you help.

30:25.058 --> 30:28.017
Well, let's see if we
can get her some, okay?

30:34.017 --> 30:35.348
Yes, ma'am.

30:35.350 --> 30:36.848
Yes, ma'am.

Silly.

31:03.100 --> 31:05.931
It's not that I
don't know Spanish.

31:05.933 --> 31:08.681
It's just not my
first language, okay?

31:08.683 --> 31:10.931
And sometimes I feel a little
shy about speaking it

31:10.933 --> 31:14.557
with someone who likes
to roll their Rs.

31:14.559 --> 31:16.764
I would love to go
to dinner with you tonight.

(Gael) Perfect.

31:18.434 --> 31:20.056
Well, it's like one minute,
she's the life of the party,

and then the next--

31:21.100 --> 31:22.848
these episodes.

31:22.850 --> 31:25.140
You know, I think honestly
she just needs some attention.

31:25.142 --> 31:27.223
Well, you know,
depression can manifest itself

31:27.225 --> 31:28.764
in many different ways,

31:28.766 --> 31:31.681
and that's what makes the
disease even more complicated,

31:31.683 --> 31:32.723
because it can be triggered

31:32.725 --> 31:35.265
by both positive
and negative stimuli,

31:35.267 --> 31:37.557
and for someone like Lisa

31:37.559 --> 31:39.390
it's not only
debilitating for her.

31:39.392 --> 31:43.223
It consumes her with this
overwhelming feeling

31:43.225 --> 31:46.723
of hopelessness, which can
result in a general feeling

31:46.725 --> 31:48.265
of inadequacy.

31:48.267 --> 31:49.889
Well, you just described
what I go through

do you think Lisa's in a state

31:58.975 --> 32:00.806

had sex in so long?

32:00.808 --> 32:02.390
Oh, my--

I'd be, like, raaa!

32:05.350 --> 32:08.307
You'd be in a fairytale,
'cause it'd never happen.

32:08.309 --> 32:09.348
Hey.

32:09.350 --> 32:11.056
So, my promise to God

32:11.058 --> 32:13.015
is just some sort of joke now.

32:13.017 --> 32:15.432
No, no. I was, like--

32:15.434 --> 32:17.390
Just gossiping about me
in my own house.

32:17.392 --> 32:20.098
Now are we even?

32:20.100 --> 32:22.265
I'm gonna go.

32:22.267 --> 32:23.806
I'm surprised
that you even find time

32:23.808 --> 32:25.931
to fit me into your schedule.

32:25.933 --> 32:27.432
What are you talking about?

32:27.434 --> 32:29.181
I dropped everything for you.
- Okay. You know what?

32:29.183 --> 32:32.181
Has to say, okay?

32:32.183 --> 32:33.307
Oh, this'll be good.

32:33.309 --> 32:34.848
See? Why do you have
to be so fake?

32:34.850 --> 32:36.265
I mean even this with Valerie.

32:36.267 --> 32:37.681
Acting like she's
your girl or something.

32:37.683 --> 32:39.098
Are you delusional as well?

32:39.100 --> 32:40.973
You know Valerie through me.

32:40.975 --> 32:42.973
Just last week she was talking
mess about you behind your back.

32:42.975 --> 32:44.348
Just like she does
with all of us.

32:44.350 --> 32:45.931
Okay, Val, it's been real.

32:45.933 --> 32:47.265
Good seeing you. I'm gonna go.

32:47.267 --> 32:48.515
Mary Jane,
just give her a second.

32:48.517 --> 32:50.307
And yet, still,
we all continue

32:50.309 --> 32:52.432
to bow down at your feet.

32:52.434 --> 32:54.473
How come you get everything
you want in life,

32:54.475 --> 32:56.056
and I get nothing?

32:56.058 --> 32:57.973
You have a family
that loves you,

32:57.975 --> 32:59.931
and all you ever do is complain.

32:59.933 --> 33:02.515
And you, with your
total lack of appreciation

33:02.517 --> 33:04.181
for everything that you have?

33:04.183 --> 33:07.681
Your selfishness is rewarded
with an abundance of blessings.

33:07.683 --> 33:09.181
I mean come on.

33:09.183 --> 33:11.307
You have an unfair
amount of beauty,

33:11.309 --> 33:12.723
intelligence, wealth, fame,

33:12.725 --> 33:15.931
and all you ever want is more.

33:15.933 --> 33:17.764
And David.

33:17.766 --> 33:21.931
You've used all your powers
to chase him away,

33:21.933 --> 33:24.473
and despite everything that he's
got going on in his life,

33:24.475 --> 33:26.848
he still loves you
with all his heart.

33:26.850 --> 33:29.681
Do you know what I would give to
have a man look at me like that?

33:29.683 --> 33:31.390
Do you?

33:31.392 --> 33:32.764
I'm gonna go.
- Okay, Mary--

33:32.766 --> 33:34.056
No. I'm gonna go.
No, because I'm done.

33:34.058 --> 33:35.806
I'm done. I really am.

33:35.808 --> 33:39.181
Lisa, I have been tiptoeing
around your feelings

33:39.183 --> 33:40.681
since the third grade,

33:40.683 --> 33:42.223
and ever since,
I have put your problems

33:42.225 --> 33:43.723
on my back thinking
that I could save you.

33:43.725 --> 33:45.848
Thinking that I was enough,
but I get it.

33:45.850 --> 33:47.181
I absolutely get it.

33:47.183 --> 33:49.806
I am not enough,
and I never have been enough,

33:49.808 --> 33:52.764
so do yourself a favor
and get yourself some help,

33:52.766 --> 33:54.432
because I'm done. I'm out.

33:54.434 --> 33:57.723
I can't handle this anymore.

33:57.725 --> 33:59.515
There she goes,
ladies and gentlemen.

33:59.517 --> 34:01.515
Always ready
to take center stage,

34:01.517 --> 34:03.390
even when it's not
remotely about her.

34:03.392 --> 34:07.267
Mary Jane Pauletta "my ass"
don't stink Patterson.

34:08.183 --> 34:09.391
Are you done?

34:12.475 --> 34:14.723
I know that you
have had a very hard life,

34:14.725 --> 34:17.473
and I know that you have
some very real problems

34:17.475 --> 34:20.056
that you need to deal with,

34:20.058 --> 34:22.348
but I have problems too.

34:22.350 --> 34:25.973
So, for the first time,

34:25.975 --> 34:29.431
I'm going to take
care of myself

34:29.434 --> 34:30.683
for once.

34:43.309 --> 34:44.931
Hi.
- Hi.

34:44.933 --> 34:46.389
I'm meeting Gael Montoya.

34:46.391 --> 34:48.306
Yes, he's right over there.

34:48.309 --> 34:49.683
Ah. There he is.

34:52.808 --> 34:54.181
Wow.

34:54.183 --> 34:56.848
Hi.
- Hi.

34:56.850 --> 35:02.015
How you doing?
- You look nice.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.432
Thank you.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.557
Oh, so we're speaking
English now?

35:05.559 --> 35:06.766
Yeah.

35:08.808 --> 35:10.432
Sorry about that.

35:10.434 --> 35:12.764
I was just trying to bust
your balls a little bit.

35:12.766 --> 35:14.764
I'm sure you were.
- Yeah.

35:14.766 --> 35:19.515
I probably took the joke
a little too far.

35:19.517 --> 35:22.681
Well, I'm sure
I didn't help matters any.

35:22.683 --> 35:25.098
I tend to be
a teeny bit sensitive

35:25.100 --> 35:28.681
when challenged about
my allegiance to my culture.

35:28.683 --> 35:29.889
Just a teeny bit.

35:29.891 --> 35:31.142
Hmm.

35:33.683 --> 35:35.848
Are you always this nice?

35:35.850 --> 35:37.557
Trust me.

35:37.559 --> 35:39.348
I'm not that nice.
- Oh, good.

35:39.350 --> 35:40.725
Then you still have a chance.

35:42.850 --> 35:44.681
To not being so nice.

35:44.683 --> 35:48.015
And to...

35:48.017 --> 35:49.056
new beginnings.

35:49.058 --> 35:50.683
I like that.

35:54.142 --> 35:55.931
Mmm.

35:55.933 --> 35:58.056
Very good.

35:58.058 --> 36:02.681
So, I want to hear
all about Gael.

36:02.683 --> 36:06.056
What is it like being
a geo-something engineer?

36:06.058 --> 36:07.098
What is it?
- Geotechnical.

36:07.100 --> 36:08.681
Technical, right.

36:08.683 --> 36:11.140
And I'm not even gonna pretend
I know what that means.

36:11.142 --> 36:12.473
I pretty much assess the risks

36:12.475 --> 36:14.931
involved prior to building
large structures.

36:14.933 --> 36:16.515
Oh, okay.

36:16.517 --> 36:20.889
Factoring in things like
earthquakes, landslides,

36:20.891 --> 36:22.140
sinkholes,

36:22.142 --> 36:26.098
soil liquefaction.

36:26.100 --> 36:27.889
Have I bored you to death yet?

36:27.891 --> 36:28.973
No, no.

36:28.975 --> 36:30.681
Actually, it--

36:30.683 --> 36:32.683
it sounds fascinating, really.

36:35.683 --> 36:38.056
Well, the first thing
you learn in my line of work

36:38.058 --> 36:41.973
is that everything in life
has a return period,

36:41.975 --> 36:45.098
and that no matter how hard
you try to fight against it,

36:45.100 --> 36:46.515
eventually, everything

36:46.517 --> 36:50.683
has to return back
to its natural state.

36:56.267 --> 36:57.975
[line ringing]

37:00.142 --> 37:02.557
Hey.

37:02.559 --> 37:05.307
Can you come over?

37:05.309 --> 37:07.390
Yeah.

37:07.392 --> 37:10.056
Just let yourself in, okay?

37:10.058 --> 37:12.764
And once you fully commit
to rebuilding something,

37:12.766 --> 37:16.056
even if you factor
in all the risks involved,

37:16.058 --> 37:18.390
even then, unfortunately,
you're just as likely to fail

37:18.392 --> 37:20.058
as you are to succeed.

37:22.434 --> 37:25.683
But those are the risks
we all have to take.
