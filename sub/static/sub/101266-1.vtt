02:15.628 --> 02:18.698
<i>pointed at your heart,
you pray it jams.</i>

02:19.397 --> 02:22.034
It won't.
But you fucking pray anyway.

02:23.870 --> 02:28.306
Socrates said death is the
greatest of all human blessings.

02:29.742 --> 02:32.477
You think he thought that when he
was executed for being a pedophile?

02:34.579 --> 02:37.349
Now get off your fucking phone,
I got a story to set up.

02:37.382 --> 02:40.853
<i>So back in the 1800s this town
was known for two things:</i>

02:40.887 --> 02:45.557
<i>gold and whores.
They don't have whores anymore.</i>

02:45.590 --> 02:48.460
<i>But gold,
that they still produce</i>

02:48.493 --> 02:50.529
<i>more than anywhere
in the country.</i>

02:51.463 --> 02:54.100
That gold,
that's why I'm here.

02:54.133 --> 02:58.470
Town is also haunted as hell but ghosts
aren't real, so who gives a shit.

02:58.503 --> 03:00.807
Where are my manners?
My name is Ben.

03:03.910 --> 03:08.748
I'm 26 years young, single, and was voted
most likely to flunk out of high school.

03:08.781 --> 03:12.517
And guess what, I did.

03:13.052 --> 03:15.655
Who needs a diploma
when you got a face like this?

03:15.688 --> 03:18.724
Was that conceited, I was
conceited. Whatever.

03:19.659 --> 03:22.929
So here's the deal. I came to this little
gold town in southern Taylor County

03:22.962 --> 03:27.133
to pull a job. Now,
this particular job I can't do on my own.

03:27.166 --> 03:32.537
And as lady luck would have it,
I have family here, close family.

03:33.873 --> 03:37.009
You know in retrospect I do
feel bad about bringing her in.

03:38.543 --> 03:40.880
Fuck it, I'm rambling.
Just watch.

03:41.914 --> 03:43.816
[man]
Hell, she is not my sister.

03:45.651 --> 03:48.553
There you go boys.
Anything else?

03:48.587 --> 03:53.491
Yeah.
That ass right here now.

03:55.460 --> 03:58.530
I've been watching you
all night. You want me.

03:59.165 --> 04:03.435
You can't stop thinking about us
bumping uglies, can you?

04:03.468 --> 04:08.074
Come here. You tell me
the date on that penny

04:08.107 --> 04:11.143
without moving the shot glass
and this ass is all yours.

04:15.181 --> 04:20.418
[Ben] <i>This is Annie, my sister,
a real fucking lady.</i>

04:21.019 --> 04:24.056
Ouch! You stupid bitch,
I'm gonna kill you.

04:24.090 --> 04:27.693
- Try me asshole.
- [man 2] Get out before more accidents started happening.

04:27.727 --> 04:30.129
- Better go tell Charlie.
- [man 2] You got it kiddo.

04:31.496 --> 04:33.733
[Ben] <i>Look, I haven't exactly
been a good brother.</i>

04:33.766 --> 04:36.501
<i>Last time I saw my sister,
I may have borrowed her car</i>

04:36.534 --> 04:38.771
<i>without asking indefinitely.</i>

04:39.906 --> 04:43.209
<i>I didn't screw her over on purpose,
it just, you know, happened that way.</i>

04:43.242 --> 04:44.911
<i>But she's always had
a bad memory.</i>

04:44.944 --> 04:46.544
Hi Annie.

04:49.115 --> 04:50.448
Oh.

04:51.616 --> 04:54.452
[Annie] You got serious balls
showing your face here.

04:54.486 --> 04:56.222
Don't you want to know
why I'm here?

04:56.255 --> 04:57.657
I'd love to know
when you're leaving.

05:00.259 --> 05:04.630
- Well, bar looks nice.
- You want it? I'm selling it.

05:07.867 --> 05:09.268
Selling it, huh?

05:10.770 --> 05:14.740
I do actually need the bar,
I mean to use it while you still have it.

05:14.774 --> 05:18.510
- For what.
- There's this guy, Paul No Balls.

05:19.645 --> 05:22.748
- Paul No Balls?
- Works for a small-time fish, wannabe gangster

05:22.782 --> 05:25.151
from back east, alright?
Paul got drunk and told Kyle that he...

05:25.184 --> 05:31.924
Got a job with this gangster guy.
Going out to Colorado.

05:31.958 --> 05:34.193
It's gonna be a big payday.

05:35.728 --> 05:36.862
Big.

05:38.664 --> 05:40.532
Kyle told me
and now I'm telling you.

05:40.565 --> 05:42.068
I don't want anything
to do with you,

05:42.101 --> 05:44.036
fucking Kyle or this.

05:44.070 --> 05:46.038
You don't exactly
have a great track record.

05:51.644 --> 05:52.979
I need sheets.

05:53.012 --> 05:54.612
Like?

05:55.214 --> 05:59.752
My car. Totaled.
All my boyfriends you chased away.

05:59.785 --> 06:02.054
I chased...
you shit with the door open.

06:02.088 --> 06:04.522
You know how many times I thought
about you since the last time

06:04.556 --> 06:06.659
- you crawled back into my life?
- Zero, probably.

06:06.692 --> 06:10.229
Zero. Not once.
It's been fucking sublime.

06:10.262 --> 06:11.630
I'd like to keep it that way.

06:14.300 --> 06:18.938
Alright, fine. Alright you made your point.
I'll get out of your hair.

06:24.977 --> 06:28.714
Oh by the way, the... the take is
five hundred thousand dollars.

06:30.582 --> 06:31.984
[soft music playing]

07:11.123 --> 07:13.793
- She's in.
- Really?

07:14.393 --> 07:17.763
- Sort of.
- Is she or isn't she?

07:17.797 --> 07:19.031
She will be.

07:19.065 --> 07:20.733
[phone vibrating]

07:23.702 --> 07:26.272
- Bingo.
- You know it's a slot machine.

07:27.139 --> 07:28.741
No, you fucking idiot, Annie.

07:29.308 --> 07:31.243
We meet her in twenty minutes.
Get your shit together

07:31.277 --> 07:33.245
and get ready.
You smell like cat piss.

07:37.016 --> 07:38.616
You smell like dog piss.

07:39.885 --> 07:41.720
[music continues playing]

07:56.969 --> 07:59.738
- [indistinct chatter]
- Sit down boys.

08:00.806 --> 08:04.643
- Excuse you?
- Annie's in the john. Take a seat.

08:06.412 --> 08:09.148
- You're Annie's friend from earlier, right?
- David.

08:09.181 --> 08:11.250
- Dave. Can I call you Dave?
- Blow me.

08:12.418 --> 08:14.987
David, I'm Ben. This is Kyle.

08:15.020 --> 08:17.223
We've got some business
to discuss with my sister

08:17.256 --> 08:20.259
so I appreciate the little
gimmick you're doing here but...

08:20.292 --> 08:21.927
You like to run your mouth
a lot, don't you?

08:23.963 --> 08:27.800
I used to know a three-dollar whore down
in Mexico that used to do the same thing.

08:27.833 --> 08:31.437
- Three dollars, huh? How's your T cell count?
- Ben, Kyle.

08:31.470 --> 08:34.807
- So you've met David.
- [scoffs] Yeah.

08:34.840 --> 08:37.876
- And how's your cat?
- Get to the plan, chief.

08:37.909 --> 08:40.880
Alright. So there's a deal
going down tomorrow.

08:40.913 --> 08:43.916
So Paul No Balls
is driving his employer,

08:43.948 --> 08:46.886
small-time gangster by the name
of Mr. Leonard, who's swapping

08:46.919 --> 08:50.689
gold for cash with some hillbilly
motherfuckers up in the mountains.

08:52.258 --> 08:54.460
- What the fuck?
- Telling the plan.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.996
Anyway, when the swap is done,
I bring Paul

08:57.029 --> 08:59.331
<i>and Mr. Leonard back to the bar,
get them a little tipsy</i>

08:59.365 --> 09:02.201
<i>and swap the bag of gold out
for a bag of not gold.</i>

09:02.234 --> 09:05.037
I'll see them off.
Once they're gone, Annie gets your cut,

09:05.070 --> 09:07.039
Kyle and I disappear.
Good enough?

09:07.940 --> 09:10.809
What stops them from coming
back to the bar back to Annie?

09:10.843 --> 09:13.913
That's a beautiful thing.
I take all the blame.

09:13.946 --> 09:18.117
By the time they figure it out,
Kyle and I'll be long gone.

09:18.150 --> 09:22.321
- What's our cut?
- What do I look like the employment office?

09:22.354 --> 09:25.191
- We need Annie, that's it.
- David's part of the deal. Take it or leave it.

09:25.991 --> 09:27.126
Come on.

09:28.194 --> 09:29.795
- Alright, we're done here.
- No, no, no.

09:30.329 --> 09:31.864
Let me talk to my associate
for a minute.

09:31.897 --> 09:32.798
Come on.

09:35.935 --> 09:39.939
You sure you want this?
I don't trust either one of those morons.

09:39.972 --> 09:43.275
Tell me about it.
It's a lot of money though.

09:43.309 --> 09:45.811
The bar's a lost cause
at this point.

09:45.844 --> 09:48.414
We really don't even have to do
anything, we just facilitate.

09:49.515 --> 09:51.951
But I get it,
if you don't want in,

09:51.984 --> 09:54.386
you got Granite Peak
to head back to.

09:54.420 --> 09:57.056
Montana is not going anywhere.

09:57.089 --> 10:00.960
I appreciate the gesture, kiddo,
but I'm gonna stick around for this one.

10:00.993 --> 10:03.896
- Twelve percent. Fifteen.
- Jesus, don't go giving away the fucking...

10:03.929 --> 10:06.799
- But what about my percent?
- We don't want to jewel her either, okay?

10:06.832 --> 10:09.301
- We need her.
- Don't fucking make me do math, man.

10:09.335 --> 10:12.037
What are we gonna do
if this shit lands in our laps?

10:12.071 --> 10:13.906
Well, that's what
I have you for.

10:22.815 --> 10:25.084
- Fifty grand.
- A hundred and fifty.

10:25.117 --> 10:27.219
- Fuck off.
- Take it or walk.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.055
A hundred.

10:34.593 --> 10:36.161
Alright.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.301
Don't fuck this up.

10:51.443 --> 10:52.811
So what now?

10:53.612 --> 10:57.182
Now, my son, you call Paul,

10:57.216 --> 11:00.319
we get a good night's sleep 'cause
tomorrow I got a fish to impress.

15:03.830 --> 15:07.366
God. Dude, the meeting's in two fucking
hours. What the hell did you do?

15:07.399 --> 15:11.236
- I said I wasn't Jewish.
- What? I know your fucking rabbi.

15:11.270 --> 15:13.338
Yeah, I lied
in the wrong direction.

15:13.372 --> 15:15.374
- Alright. Put that on.
- Shit.

15:15.407 --> 15:19.511
- So I need you, Kyle the fucking Philistine...
- Okay.

15:19.545 --> 15:23.115
...to pretend you're Jewish
for five fucking minutes, man.

15:23.148 --> 15:28.086
That's it.
Coming at you. Alright.

15:28.120 --> 15:30.155
- Good.
- I'm fucking lost, man.

15:30.188 --> 15:32.157
Exactly. Just like Moses
in the desert.

15:32.190 --> 15:34.359
- Wait, Moses or Jesus?
- Mo... they're both Jews.

15:34.393 --> 15:37.229
- Both Jews.
- There you go. There you go.

15:37.262 --> 15:40.667
- Get it off your beard. Shoes.
- It doesn't matter.

15:42.334 --> 15:43.670
- You're gonna do great, honey.
- Okay.

15:43.703 --> 15:45.203
Love you.

15:48.340 --> 15:49.742
[soft music playing]

16:00.720 --> 16:03.690
- [inaudible conversation]

16:22.942 --> 16:26.244
[Ben]
<i>Kyle the fucking Philistine.</i>

16:30.683 --> 16:31.684
Shit.

16:35.187 --> 16:37.422
- What if we...
- They're already on their way.

16:38.256 --> 16:41.159
- I know goddammit.
- [crying] I'm sorry.

16:41.193 --> 16:43.528
- What direction did they go?
- I don't know, north-west?

16:43.562 --> 16:45.732
- Heading out of town?
- South-west.

16:45.765 --> 16:47.734
- I'm not a fucking boy scout.
- Give me the keys.

16:48.635 --> 16:51.203
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna find them.

16:56.508 --> 16:58.310
You fucking degenerate.

16:59.444 --> 17:00.747
[moans]

17:02.915 --> 17:05.183
[rock music playing]

17:45.892 --> 17:47.292
Jesse.

18:00.439 --> 18:02.942
- [Paul] What are they inbred?
- [Mr. Leonard] Get out.

18:02.975 --> 18:04.744
Let me out of the car, will you?

18:04.777 --> 18:06.646
[Paul] You come to us.

18:06.679 --> 18:09.314
I don't talk to people
through windows.

18:09.347 --> 18:10.650
[Mr. Leonard] Get out.

18:20.727 --> 18:22.628
Just open the door,
will you?

18:26.531 --> 18:27.734
These fucking bones.

18:35.474 --> 18:39.478
You must be Wyatt. Let's do
some business, shall we?

18:53.726 --> 18:55.527
Jesus fucking Christ.

18:56.361 --> 18:57.830
You boys have been busy, huh?

19:02.400 --> 19:04.937
[upbeat music playing]

19:14.346 --> 19:16.615
[Ben] <i>See, the thing
about the gold here,</i>

19:16.649 --> 19:19.451
<i>it isn't in nuggets
like I thought.</i>

19:19.484 --> 19:22.088
<i>It's in small
almost invisible veins</i>

19:22.121 --> 19:23.288
<i>inside the rock.</i>

19:25.124 --> 19:28.861
<i>And the only way to extract it
is with cyanide.</i>

19:29.629 --> 19:31.530
[man] I'll kill you,
motherfucker.

19:33.699 --> 19:35.902
[Ben] <i>Yeah, that cyanide.</i>

19:35.935 --> 19:39.705
<i>Once it's been crushed,
soaked</i>

19:39.739 --> 19:43.976
<i>and then dried,
what you're left with is dust,</i>

19:45.945 --> 19:49.849
<i>extremely valuable dust.</i>

19:55.387 --> 19:56.088
You got a deal.

19:59.992 --> 20:01.093
You got the cash?

20:02.662 --> 20:04.897
Look, I gotta take this back,
make sure it's legit.

20:04.931 --> 20:08.634
- You'll get your money soon.
- I'm gonna have to disagree.

20:08.668 --> 20:10.435
You fucking Gentiles.
Goddamn your blood.

20:10.468 --> 20:13.739
Did you really think
I was gonna come out here

20:13.773 --> 20:15.407
carrying
that kind of cash on me?

20:16.809 --> 20:20.780
Okay, look, I don't know you,
but you know me.

20:20.813 --> 20:23.749
More importantly,
my reputation.

20:23.783 --> 20:25.818
Trust goes both ways
where I come from.

20:27.186 --> 20:29.088
Mister, you ain't
where you come from.

20:30.122 --> 20:33.726
[scoffs] You know, you're pretty
stiff for a couple of hillbillies.

20:36.996 --> 20:38.998
You have no idea.

20:42.168 --> 20:44.003
Hey, hey, hey.

20:46.438 --> 20:47.807
Oh, shit.

No shit.

25:12.104 --> 25:13.939
[music continues playing]

26:10.029 --> 26:13.032
- Don't fucking move.
- Oh, hey now buddy.

26:13.065 --> 26:15.334
- Drop the gun.
- Easy now.

26:24.109 --> 26:28.013
- Are you a priest?
- Sometimes.

26:28.047 --> 26:31.283
What? Kick the gun to me.
Right now.

26:34.486 --> 26:36.755
Come on.

26:36.789 --> 26:39.892
- [gunshot]
- Jesus, what the hell did you do?

26:39.925 --> 26:42.161
You told me to kick
a loaded gun.

26:42.194 --> 26:44.096
Shit. No, stay down.

26:44.129 --> 26:46.131
Why are you following me?

26:46.165 --> 26:49.335
- You took something that doesn't belong to you.
- Shit.

26:49.368 --> 26:50.736
Yeah.

26:55.174 --> 26:57.810
I can't have you following me.
I'm sorry.

26:58.510 --> 27:00.846
Oh, god damn it.

27:02.014 --> 27:03.515
- Give me your shoes.
- No.

27:03.549 --> 27:04.483
Now.

27:16.295 --> 27:19.832
Socks too.
I'm not fucking around.

27:21.133 --> 27:24.503
[grumbling]

[Annie] <i>Where the fuck have you been?
Kyle said you didn't get in.</i>

27:53.365 --> 27:57.236
[Ben] <i>We didn't get in and it doesn't
matter anyways 'cause I got the shit.</i>

28:02.642 --> 28:05.210
- What the hell is that?
- The shit.

28:06.111 --> 28:08.914
- That does not look like gold.
- It's unsmelted.

28:08.947 --> 28:11.016
Oh, so all we have to do
is smelt it?

28:11.950 --> 28:14.420
- Don't look at me.
- Yeah, yeah, smelt that shit.

28:16.155 --> 28:17.890
Are you a gold expert now?

28:24.163 --> 28:27.866
- What the fuck is that?
- What the fuck is what? Oh that.

28:27.900 --> 28:29.401
- Whose blood is that?
- Jesus Christ.

28:29.435 --> 28:31.070
- What happened?
- They fucking killed him.

28:31.103 --> 28:33.272
- [David] Who? Where?
- In the cemetery,

28:33.305 --> 28:35.642
they ran out of the woods, they
shot at me fucking bang, bang.

28:35.675 --> 28:37.910
I shot at them bang.
Now I'm here.

28:37.943 --> 28:39.478
- Did they see you?
- Yeah, they saw me.

28:39.511 --> 28:41.347
They fucking shot at me.
But I got the shit.

28:41.380 --> 28:43.215
I don't see what's
the big fucking problem is.

28:43.248 --> 28:44.416
- [David] How many were there?
- Two, maybe three

28:44.450 --> 28:46.018
- I think.
- You think?

28:46.051 --> 28:47.353
Look, I handled it.

28:47.386 --> 28:49.254
- Oh, fuck.
- Shit.

28:49.288 --> 28:52.091
Fuck, this is your fucking fault
you fucking asshole.

28:52.124 --> 28:54.960
- Fuck you.
- What the hell are we gonna do with this?

28:54.993 --> 28:58.230
- We can take it to Bill tomorrow.
- Bill? Really?

28:59.164 --> 29:02.134
- Karaoke Bill?
- Yeah, he's been prepping for the end of the world

29:02.167 --> 29:04.937
for a while.
He believes in these three G's,

29:04.970 --> 29:07.640
God, guns,
and lucky for us, gold.

29:08.941 --> 29:09.809
No, that's good.

29:10.943 --> 29:13.312
- From now on we call the shots.
- Right on.

29:26.258 --> 29:28.927
So this is supposed to be worth
half a million bucks, huh?

29:28.961 --> 29:30.929
- I guess.
- You guess? You ass.

29:30.963 --> 29:32.699
[Ben] Listen, assface,
people died for this shit.

29:32.732 --> 29:35.567
Get three dollar mouth shut
when I'm talking.

29:37.102 --> 29:40.105
- I could snuff you out.
- Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you,

29:40.139 --> 29:42.241
so you could have anal
to your pervy ass self.

29:42.274 --> 29:44.677
You vomit that shit again, I'll
put you so deep in the ground

29:44.711 --> 29:47.045
the fucking worms
won't be able to find you.

29:47.079 --> 29:48.947
- David. Let him go.
- [Ben] Aargh!

29:50.149 --> 29:53.318
Fuck you.
That's right, bitch. [moaning]

29:54.253 --> 29:56.088
We got to think
about calling Charlie in.

29:56.121 --> 29:57.556
- Hell no.
- [Ben] Who the fuck is Charlie?

29:57.589 --> 29:59.124
- A cop.
- A cop?

29:59.158 --> 30:00.959
- David.
- Are you insane?

30:00.993 --> 30:03.228
- We're gonna think...
- He's not gonna find out.

30:03.262 --> 30:05.464
- We don't have time.
- Let's just call a fucking cop.

30:05.497 --> 30:08.000
That'll be great, yeah.
Great. Fuck you.

30:08.500 --> 30:11.470
[soft music playing]

30:39.364 --> 30:41.734
[David] I just texted Charlie.
He is on his way.

30:46.205 --> 30:47.473
[door closes]

30:48.273 --> 30:50.542
Oh, shit.

30:50.576 --> 30:52.377
[Wyatt] Knock-knock.

30:53.713 --> 30:56.548
[Kyle] Fuck, fuck.

30:56.582 --> 31:00.085
- [Ben] He's got a fucking gun.
- [David] Can't escape this, kid.

31:00.118 --> 31:01.654
What the fuck did you do?

31:02.454 --> 31:03.756
Fuck you.

31:03.790 --> 31:05.692
[gunshots]

31:05.725 --> 31:08.695
- Let's negotiate.
- [Wyatt] Fuck you negotiate.

31:08.728 --> 31:11.631
What if you just take the shit and
we'll let this whole thing slide?

31:11.664 --> 31:16.636
[Wyatt] Very Christian of you. If you give
yourself up with the gold, then maybe.

31:16.669 --> 31:18.203
[David] So it's a stalemate?

31:20.506 --> 31:22.775
[police siren wailing]

31:27.747 --> 31:29.014
[car door closes]

31:42.594 --> 31:44.764
Oh, don't show me evidence.

31:44.797 --> 31:47.734
I didn't want to bring you into
this but we do need your help.

31:47.767 --> 31:50.335
To protect and serve.
Now's your chance.

31:50.369 --> 31:53.238
- Why don't you just give it back to them?
- We tried that. Didn't work.

31:53.272 --> 31:54.606
- They want blood.
- Whose blood?

31:54.641 --> 31:56.375
- His blood.
- My blood.

31:56.408 --> 31:59.077
- Who the hell are you?
- My brother, Ben.

31:59.111 --> 32:01.213
- Annie, you didn't tell me you have a brother.
- I know.

32:01.246 --> 32:04.216
Funny she didn't tell me she's
dating a fucking cop either.

32:04.249 --> 32:06.151
- No offense.
- Yeah, none taken.

32:06.184 --> 32:08.287
Look, Chuck...
can I call you Chuck?

32:08.320 --> 32:10.188
- You sit there and be the fuck quiet.
- I think that...

32:10.222 --> 32:11.858
You too.
The grown-ups are talking.

32:11.891 --> 32:13.525
Charlie, please,
we need your help.

32:13.559 --> 32:15.160
Look, I'm here, aren't I?

32:15.193 --> 32:17.563
Just give me a second.

32:26.773 --> 32:30.275
[grumbling]

32:38.450 --> 32:39.217
You good?

32:39.919 --> 32:42.521
- Got a plan?
- [Annie] A rough one.

32:42.554 --> 32:45.157
You, Ben, and David
take this shit to Bill.

32:45.190 --> 32:47.392
Kyle and I will stay here.
David's already prepared him

32:47.426 --> 32:49.595
for what's coming, he's willing
to pay cash for gold.

32:49.629 --> 32:52.765
Well, if it were any other men,
I'd say yeah, it might work.

32:52.799 --> 32:54.499
But you got the McCloud brothers
after you.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.803
Wyatt and Jesse?
Are you sure?

32:56.836 --> 32:58.604
- [Charlie] It was their truck.
- [David] Shit.

32:58.638 --> 33:01.473
- Who the hell are the McClouds?
- Bad news.

33:01.506 --> 33:03.542
I don't care who it is.
I'm not leaving you with Kyle

33:03.575 --> 33:05.845
- when bullets are flying.
- Woah, woah, woah! Bad news?

33:06.879 --> 33:09.314
So what if they shoot us
the second we walk out the door?

33:09.348 --> 33:10.650
- They won't.
- Why not?

33:10.683 --> 33:12.384
They want
to make you suffer.

33:13.185 --> 33:16.455
- That's not helping.
- You're not staying alone with that idiot.

33:20.727 --> 33:22.327
Where is that idiot?

33:26.766 --> 33:29.836
[upbeat music playing]

33:44.984 --> 33:47.720
[David] Hey, thanks again, Bill.
See you tomorrow.

33:49.621 --> 33:52.659
As soon as the light hits,
take the kid to the station.

33:52.692 --> 33:54.794
Pick up some supplies for tomorrow.
We need to be ready.

33:54.827 --> 33:56.896
Just go to Bill's now
and get the cash.

33:56.929 --> 33:58.397
He is at a gun show
in Canyon City.

33:58.430 --> 33:59.766
Won't be back till morning.

33:59.799 --> 34:01.266
- Fuck.
- What about Kyle?

34:01.968 --> 34:04.302
We can't just leave him
with those bastards.

34:04.336 --> 34:05.604
It's not gonna happen.

34:07.305 --> 34:08.875
What? I agree with David.

34:08.908 --> 34:11.510
Fucking pig. Annie?

34:11.543 --> 34:14.212
- Don't look at me. Fuck Kyle.
- Screw you.

34:14.246 --> 34:15.915
You're all fucking heartless.

34:15.947 --> 34:18.417
You go look for him.
Nobody's stopping you.

34:18.449 --> 34:19.652
[Ben] Fine. I will.

34:21.920 --> 34:23.188
Ben.

34:25.389 --> 34:27.324
So now you want to go be a hero?

34:27.359 --> 34:28.960
You might as well put
two bullets in your own skull.
