00:09.844 --> 00:11.052
Previously on Power....

00:11.094 --> 00:14.055
You made the right choice
paying me instead of Karen.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.390
Milan?
Who the fuck is Milan?

00:15.432 --> 00:18.143
Dean. He might be the most
dangerous man I ever met.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.394
I went to see Tasha.

00:19.436 --> 00:23.064
She was afraid, but more
for her friend than herself.

00:23.106 --> 00:26.067
- What friend?
- LaKeisha.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.153
At the sound of
the beep, leave a message.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.864
Damn, 'Keisha.
Where you at?

00:29.905 --> 00:31.323
This is your revenge?

00:31.365 --> 00:34.075
-It's not personal, Milan.
-Just business.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.872
Did you tell Ghost

00:37.913 --> 00:39.623
we're still going to sell drugs
in his clubs?

00:39.665 --> 00:41.208
Nah,
he'll know soon enough.

00:41.249 --> 00:44.085
What did Ghost really take away
from you?

00:44.127 --> 00:46.087
My name's Slim.
You mind if we shoot a few?

00:46.129 --> 00:47.088
Yeah, sure.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.507
Where's your brother?

00:48.549 --> 00:50.968
He went to hang out with that
new friend of his, Slim.

00:51.010 --> 00:52.553
Slim?
Who's Slim?

00:52.594 --> 00:54.095
Ransom his ass.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.097
You get Ghost's money,
kill his kid,

00:56.139 --> 00:58.392
you ride off
into the sunset.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.685
You were covering your tracks.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.102

01:03.022 --> 01:06.274
Looks like Greg Knox
was your leak.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.860
This case is closed.

01:17.411 --> 01:22.583
Angie, I told you
that I needed to protect
you from Greg.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.083
I'd do anything to protect you.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.127
You are under arrest
for the murder

01:26.169 --> 01:28.129
of Special Agent Gregory Knox.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.840

you're doing this to me.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.441

man?

06:41.902 --> 06:43.486

06:43.528 --> 06:44.571
I shouldn't be here.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.656

he'd been fucking with.

Hey, wait, what do you mean,
"find Tariq"?

07:01.504 --> 07:04.465
He's missing, Dre.
They asked Tasha for money.

07:04.507 --> 07:07.552
who is Slim?

07:07.594 --> 07:09.679
Whoo!

07:09.721 --> 07:12.432
I told you to have a closer eye
on the kid.

07:12.473 --> 07:14.309
You told me
it was family business.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.477
You told me to fall back.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.064
Do you know where he is
or not?

07:19.106 --> 07:20.357

07:23.318 --> 07:24.485
Wait, wait, wait,
you don't know?

07:24.527 --> 07:25.987

he would have called you.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.739
Tommy, Ghost just got arrested
tonight.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.908
His girlfriend, Angela,
just dragged him out of here

07:29.950 --> 07:31.201
in some handcuffs, man.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.453
You'd better tell his wife.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.124
What the fuck?

08:53.783 --> 08:56.244
You said
you were in outpatient.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.871
You said you were gonna kick.

08:57.912 --> 08:58.955
I know.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.665
I fucked up.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.001
Don't you think
I feel bad enough?

09:03.043 --> 09:04.378
You come in here,

09:04.419 --> 09:05.670

09:53.051 --> 09:54.635

09:54.677 --> 09:56.513
All right, don't talk to anyone
at all about this

09:56.555 --> 09:58.306
or about anything else,
do you understand me?

09:58.348 --> 10:00.600
Keep your mouth
and your sphincter shut.

10:00.641 --> 10:01.642
I'll be there first thing

10:01.684 --> 10:03.144
I will get you out of there.

10:03.186 --> 10:05.439
Don't believe him.
He's a fucking liar.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.024
Okay, okay, uh,
listen, make sure you
tell Tasha...

10:08.066 --> 10:09.484
I will.

10:09.526 --> 10:10.651
Get off the phone, man.
I gotta move you to your cell.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.653
-All right, all right,
all right.
-Just stay strong.

10:12.695 --> 10:16.241
Williams,
it's lights-out.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.534
Get off the phone, nigga.

10:18.701 --> 10:21.246
All right, man, okay.
Talk to you later.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.918
Hello?
Who is this?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.504
Tasha, it's Joseph Proctor,

10:29.546 --> 10:30.671
you husband's attorney.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.257
James was arrested tonight.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.674
He's in custody downtown

10:33.716 --> 10:35.218

Correctional Center.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.387
W-wait a minute.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.680
Wh--is--is he all right?
What happened?

10:39.722 --> 10:41.057
It's a homicide charge.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.642
Homicide?

10:42.683 --> 10:44.060
Who are they saying...

10:44.102 --> 10:45.686
I don't have
any other details.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.272
The most important thing
you could do

10:47.314 --> 10:49.441
to help right now is
to remain calm

10:49.483 --> 10:51.192
and keep your kids calm too.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.860
Tariq is missing.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.363
I've been trying to reach James
all night to tell him.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.198
What kind of missing?

10:57.240 --> 10:59.075
Is he with some friends, or...

10:59.117 --> 11:00.785
-They asked for ransom.
-Shit!

11:00.827 --> 11:02.703
That's the last thing James
needs to hear right now.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.706
-Dad!
-Turn your headphones up, baby.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.751
If James calls you,
you do not tell him that.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.837
-Do you understand?
-I don't even know you.

11:10.878 --> 11:13.714
You can't tell me not to tell
my husband I can't find his son.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.634
Listen to me
very carefully.

11:15.674 --> 11:17.093
Your husband has just
been through

11:17.135 --> 11:19.720
the most humiliating process
a man ever faces,

11:19.762 --> 11:22.056
all because of his girlfriend.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.518
Angela?

11:24.559 --> 11:26.936
Are you fucking kidding me?

11:26.978 --> 11:28.647
Angela arrested him?

11:28.687 --> 11:30.773
Yes, so right now
is not the best time

11:30.815 --> 11:32.733
to tell him that
on top of all that,

11:32.775 --> 11:34.735
his son is missing
at the precise moment

11:34.777 --> 11:37.238
he can do absolutely nothing
about it.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.282
He will not be able to function,

11:39.324 --> 11:44.204
and I need him to function
to help me get him out of there.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.664
Do you understand?

11:47.165 --> 11:49.543
Yeah.
I understand.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.920
He's out cold.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.631
We haven't heard
from his mother yet?

11:54.673 --> 11:56.550
-Nothing.
-Nothing on the scanner either.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.009
She ain't called the police.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.771
It's cool.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.775
Yo, you got Tariq?

12:14.817 --> 12:16.570
What the fuck you doin' here?

12:16.611 --> 12:18.196
Yo, who are they?

12:18.238 --> 12:19.780
You walkin' up in our spot.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.158
I think the question is,
who the fuck are you?

12:22.200 --> 12:23.784
This is Dre.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.537
He works for Ghost.
He used to work for me.

12:25.579 --> 12:26.787
I still work for you.

12:26.829 --> 12:27.955
And I need to take Tariq home

12:27.997 --> 12:29.790
before Tommy kill you and me
both, man.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.377
-Is he here?
-He ain't going home tonight.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.254
I got different plans
for the kid.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.630
Oh, I know about your plan.

12:35.672 --> 12:38.007
Hey, you asked Tasha for money?

12:38.049 --> 12:40.468
You ain't getting shit
from Ghost tonight, man.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.596
He got arrested a few hours ago.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.517
That clean motherfucker
finally got got?

12:47.559 --> 12:48.685
For what?

12:48.727 --> 12:50.687
I don't know, man.

12:50.729 --> 12:52.439
I don't see why
that should change the plan.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.232
That just puts more pressure
on the wife.

12:54.274 --> 12:57.235
And when Ghost finds out you got
his kid and he's in jail...

12:58.861 --> 13:02.490
That's a level of pain
you ain't even planned on.

13:02.532 --> 13:03.824
Plus the money.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.285
Well, if it's money you want,

13:05.326 --> 13:07.621
I'm in a better position
to give it to you than Ghost.

13:07.662 --> 13:10.290
I'm back working for Tommy
moving weight.

13:10.331 --> 13:13.042
Um, uh,
I can get you back in.

13:13.084 --> 13:14.252
Good.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.587
You gettin' back
in the drug game

13:15.629 --> 13:17.297
ain't got shit to do
with our paper.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.132
I hear that,
but with the cops around Ghost,

13:19.173 --> 13:21.842
now how long before
they start looking for his kid?

13:21.884 --> 13:24.011
All the questions
they gonna be asking,

13:24.053 --> 13:25.846
too many ways
this shit could play out.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.557
Me?
I don't give a fuck.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.643
But you can't afford
to get caught.

13:29.684 --> 13:31.603
-Neither of you.
-Look, if it's money you want,

13:31.645 --> 13:34.481
I can cut you in right now,
10K a week, easy.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.857
-Each.
-15.

13:38.777 --> 13:42.071
That's almost 50K a week, man.

13:42.113 --> 13:45.866
And if you do your job right,
they won't even miss it.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.454
If it was something
about Milan

13:49.496 --> 13:50.871
or about the business...

13:50.913 --> 13:52.415
They would have come
for both of us by now.

13:52.457 --> 13:53.874
-Yeah.
-I mean, Proctor said

13:53.916 --> 13:56.043
Angela arrested him,
and you know that bitch

13:56.085 --> 13:58.171
would have been right here
if it was about us, right?

13:58.212 --> 14:00.715
-Yeah.
-He also said we can't call
the police about Tariq.

14:00.757 --> 14:03.050
He's right, Tash.
No fuckin' cops.

14:03.092 --> 14:06.638
There's no way this could be
Kanan, right?

14:06.680 --> 14:08.931
Kanan is dead, Tasha.
I mean, look.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.184
Him and Ghost walked into
that warehouse.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.936
There ain't no way
that Ghost walks out of there
if Kanan's still breathing.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.896
Yeah, you're right
about that shit.

14:15.938 --> 14:19.400
Besides, if he was still alive,
he would've shot us all by now.

14:19.442 --> 14:20.694
I mean, unless he found Jesus

14:20.735 --> 14:23.530
and got a complete
personality transplant.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.406
Are you sure?

14:25.448 --> 14:28.993
Yeah, I'm sure.
Kanan is dead.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.913
Yo, what happened?

14:32.955 --> 14:35.375
You fell asleep
like a little kid.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.043
Think you had too much lean.

14:37.084 --> 14:38.919
Yeah, my bad.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.921
Yo, my mom probably bugging out
right now.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.257
About that, Ray Ray thought
he had jokes and shit.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.677
Took a picture of you asleep,
sent it to Tasha.

14:45.719 --> 14:46.927
Told her she needed
to pay for you,

14:46.969 --> 14:48.763
like you was kidnapped
or some shit.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.348
What?
Why would he do that?

14:50.390 --> 14:52.684
He's a fuckin' idiot.

14:52.726 --> 14:56.354
We 'bout to take you home,
but you gonna have to explain
to your mom about what happened.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.733
She can't know nothing
about us all, what goes on here.

14:59.774 --> 15:01.942
Yeah, I already know.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.738
When you get there,
she gon' be upset.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.030
Somethin' else happened tonight.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.448
Look, man,
you ain't gotta tell him that.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.409
Let his mom handle it.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.911
Nigga, he deserve the truth.

15:11.952 --> 15:13.454
Your father got arrested
tonight.

15:13.496 --> 15:14.622
What?

15:14.664 --> 15:15.956
Now you see,
I was right about Ghost.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.752
I'm sorry the cops seem
to know it too.

15:18.793 --> 15:21.003
What are they sayin' he did?

15:21.045 --> 15:24.924
Whatever they sayin' he did,
he did that shit.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.096
Mm, take this.

15:30.137 --> 15:32.515
There's gon' be cops around
asking questions
and shit like that.

15:32.557 --> 15:35.393
Don't call me from
your regular phone; use that.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.895
-All right.
-All right, man.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.772
I'ma take you home now,
all right?

15:38.813 --> 15:42.983
Wait, we gotta figure out
what you gon' tell Tasha
about tonight.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.820
No, I already know what to say.
I got you.

15:50.825 --> 15:54.495
Come here, Tariq.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.581
Where was he?
Where were you?

15:56.623 --> 15:57.874
Ma, I'm sorry.

15:57.916 --> 15:58.999
I-I was just hanging out
with some friends.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.001
I fell asleep,
and he thought it would be funny

16:01.043 --> 16:03.003
to send you that picture.
It was just a big joke.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.422
--You think this is a joke?

16:04.464 --> 16:05.632
Yeah.

16:07.049 --> 16:10.010
Where was he?
How'd you know here to go?

16:10.052 --> 16:13.765
He was in Brooklyn.
I texted him and he hit me back.

16:15.182 --> 16:16.601
Hey, Tariq.

16:18.686 --> 16:22.064
Yo, man, you scared us.

16:22.106 --> 16:25.276
You was still hanging with
your boy, Slim, though, right?

16:25.318 --> 16:27.111
Who's Slim?
Do I know him?

16:27.153 --> 16:29.113
Uh, I just made him up.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.699
I met some friends
at, uh, Basketball City.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.868
You know, Raina,
she kept asking me questions,

16:33.910 --> 16:36.663
and I didn't wanna answer
'cause I wanna hang out
with my friends, you know.

16:36.704 --> 16:40.040
We drink and stuff, and
I didn't want her to tell Mom.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.042
- Oh.
- Excuse me, what?

16:42.084 --> 16:43.294
That's why I fell asleep.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.045
Mm-hmm.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.756
Who are these friends
you're hanging with, 'Riq?

16:46.798 --> 16:49.342
I'm not a snitch, Mom.

16:49.383 --> 16:51.177
I'm not gonna let them get
in trouble because I fell asleep

16:51.218 --> 16:53.053
like a little kid
and they sent the picture.

16:53.095 --> 16:55.306
- Mm.
- Yeah, in that text,

16:55.348 --> 16:56.724
whose arm is
in that picture?

16:56.766 --> 16:58.810
That was my friend's uncle.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.770
- Okay.
- You look at me, boy.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.062
I thought you were kidnapped.

17:02.104 --> 17:05.650
I thought you could've
been killed.

17:05.692 --> 17:06.943
All right, I'm sorry.

17:06.985 --> 17:08.068
I won't hang out with them
anymore.

17:08.110 --> 17:11.030
-I promise.
-Yeah, I hope not.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.657
I gotta apologize to Dad.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.201
Um, where is he?
Is he here?

17:16.744 --> 17:18.162
No, 'Riq.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.874
Sit down, please.

17:20.915 --> 17:24.335
Look, I need to talk to you
about your father.

17:24.377 --> 17:28.756
Something happened tonight.
I mean, he--he's not hurt.

17:28.798 --> 17:32.635
He's okay,
but...he's not here.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.470
What happened to Daddy?

17:34.512 --> 17:36.222
Raina.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.849
Hey, T, I'ma, um...

17:37.891 --> 17:39.559
Come here, baby girl.
He's okay.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.060
Hey, Dre, hold up.

17:42.603 --> 17:45.147
Yo, man.

17:45.189 --> 17:48.108
How'd you find him?
For real.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.403
Look, Tommy,
I'm not lying to you.

17:50.444 --> 17:53.280
I hit the kid and told him that
you and his moms was losin' it

17:53.322 --> 17:54.991
and he hit me back.

17:55.033 --> 17:57.159
I picked him up on a corner
in Bushwick, man.

17:57.201 --> 18:00.120
All right, I seen the kids,
but I don't know their names.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.875
Why do I think
you're bullshitting me?

18:06.085 --> 18:09.129
What about a goddamn thank you?

18:09.171 --> 18:13.509
If the kid didn't trust me,
he wouldn't be back.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.428
Hm?

18:15.469 --> 18:17.555
Did he answer your call?

18:18.806 --> 18:21.141
I'm outta here, man.

18:24.729 --> 18:25.980
Yo, Dre.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.274
Good lookin' out.

18:28.315 --> 18:30.150
Yeah.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.154
Oh, shit.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.502
You back in that shit?

18:48.544 --> 18:52.131
Best way to protect myself
from being fucked with
on the highway.

18:53.299 --> 18:56.094
Keep them Tariq payments
on time, okay?

18:56.135 --> 18:59.138
Dre ain't gon' cross me.

18:59.179 --> 19:01.432
Hell of a night, huh?

19:01.474 --> 19:04.268
You ain't stop smilin'
since you heard about Ghost.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.271
Thinkin' about my first night
in jail.

19:07.313 --> 19:10.190
You're away from everything
that comforts you,

19:10.232 --> 19:12.944
everything that makes you feel
at home.

19:15.529 --> 19:18.032
You have no idea
what's gon' happen to you.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.034
You have no control
over what you're doin',

19:20.076 --> 19:22.202
when you're movin',
how you eatin'.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.080
For the first time
in your life,

19:24.122 --> 19:26.206
you realize
the choices aren't yours.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.377
Fuck a gun or a knife
being pointed at you.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.089
That shit,
that first night in jail?

19:33.131 --> 19:35.215
That's real fear.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.572
Hey, Joe.

19:58.614 --> 20:01.241
You okay?

20:01.283 --> 20:03.786
Are you sure it's safe
for us to talk in here?

20:03.828 --> 20:06.664
If they bug this shit,
it's a Constitutional violation.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.249
So, yeah, we better be.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.086
Are you all right?

20:12.128 --> 20:14.588
How the fuck could I be
all right, huh, Proctor?

20:14.630 --> 20:17.967
Can't believe Angela did this
bullshit to me.

20:18.009 --> 20:21.387
--All because I hurt her?
This is revenge, man.

20:21.428 --> 20:25.725
Revenge doesn't make
fingerprints or DNA.

20:25.766 --> 20:28.477
I got a copy
of the arrest warrant.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.523
They're saying they found
your DNA on Greg Knox's body.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.026
-Under his fingernails.
-It's a lie.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.070
They're also saying
they found your fingerprints

20:37.111 --> 20:39.739
at the apartment,
the crime scene.

20:39.780 --> 20:43.283
Look, man, I was there, okay?
I was inside the apartment,
but I wore gloves.

20:43.325 --> 20:47.287
On the outside window.
Fire escape.

20:49.331 --> 20:52.710
- Motherfucker.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.713
Look, Proctor, you told me
I needed to get that recording,

20:55.755 --> 20:57.297
the button mic, off of Ruiz.

20:57.339 --> 21:00.009
You said that Tommy and I--
you said we'd go down.

21:00.051 --> 21:01.886
Yeah, I didn't tell you
to break into

21:01.928 --> 21:03.930
an FBI agent's apartment
to get it.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.305
And I didn't tell you
to kill him.

21:05.347 --> 21:08.475
I didn't kill him.
I'm innocent.

21:08.517 --> 21:11.896
Your little story of
"I broke into his apartment,
but I didn't kill him,"

21:11.938 --> 21:13.313
that's not gonna get us
anywhere.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.315
I need my kids to know
I didn't do this.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.193
Tell them when you get home.

21:17.235 --> 21:19.153
Bail is my first priority.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.572
I'm gonna blow
this warrant apart.

21:21.614 --> 21:24.324
I'm gonna say you should've
never been arrested
in the first place.

21:24.366 --> 21:28.204
But in order for me to do
what I need to do here,

21:28.246 --> 21:32.166
we need to make sure that every
single person you meet here,

21:32.208 --> 21:36.336
every guard,
every inmate, every lawyer,

21:36.378 --> 21:40.340
that they believe you are legit
club owner James St. Patrick.

21:40.382 --> 21:43.385
And you wouldn't know
what to do with a gun
if--if it fell in your lap.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.345
What about Angela?

21:45.387 --> 21:47.347
She knows me.
She knows what I've done.

21:47.389 --> 21:50.350
It's not about what she knows.
It's about what she can prove.

21:50.392 --> 21:53.520
And if she talks, we're gonna
make it a "He said, she said."

21:53.562 --> 21:55.148
But we can only do that

21:55.189 --> 21:57.942
if people believe
that you're a citizen.

21:57.984 --> 22:02.362
You gotta be James St. Patrick,
not Ghost.

22:02.404 --> 22:05.365
It's the performance
of your life.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.285
Don't fuck it up.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.752
Yeah?
Tariq is fine.

22:16.794 --> 22:19.379
He was with his...friends.

22:19.421 --> 22:20.714
How's James?

22:20.756 --> 22:22.382
Should I come see him today?

22:22.424 --> 22:24.426
There's something else
I need you to do now.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.095
Get bail money.

22:26.137 --> 22:29.515
Okay.
How much and how fast?

22:29.556 --> 22:32.350
The government will be tracing
the money.

22:32.392 --> 22:33.519
It needs to be clean.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.938
Like stand-up business owner
clean.

22:35.980 --> 22:39.399
Bags of untraceable cash
won't cut it.

22:39.441 --> 22:42.402
How much do you know about us?

22:42.444 --> 22:45.239
Enough so I know
that I need to tell you that.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.407
You need to have
about two million on hand,

22:47.449 --> 22:48.408
just in case.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.703
$2 million?
Clean money?

22:50.744 --> 22:53.413
He's accused of murdering
a federal agent, Tasha.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.124
They're saying
he shot a cop.

22:55.166 --> 22:57.210
James would never shoot a cop.

22:57.251 --> 22:59.545
How much of this
has to do with Angela?

22:59.586 --> 23:03.381
She's a distraction, Tasha.
We need to stay on task.

23:03.423 --> 23:06.135
Please, get the money together.

23:06.177 --> 23:09.680
Yo,
it's all over the news.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.640
The fuck happened, Tommy?

23:11.682 --> 23:16.020
They're saying nightclub owner
James St. Patrick
killed an FBI agent.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.437
Yeah, well,
it ain't your problem.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.481
You're still safe from Milan,
so you can go home.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.775
Now grab your shit.
Let's go.

23:21.817 --> 23:24.320
-No.
-Oh, my God.

23:24.362 --> 23:25.403
I'm not going.

23:27.031 --> 23:30.159
Ghost is in jail, you runnin'
drug money through my shop.

23:30.201 --> 23:32.410
So what if the cops come
for you next, Tommy?

23:32.452 --> 23:34.580
And then Tasha.
And then me.

23:34.621 --> 23:37.166
Guess what?
I don't feel safe.

23:37.208 --> 23:39.335
Ghost ain't got nothin' to do
with mine and Tasha's business.

23:39.377 --> 23:42.880
Yeah, but I do,
'cause you all got me twisted up
in this bullshit.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.758
So what happens if the cops
come for me, Tommy?

23:45.799 --> 23:50.304
We can prep you to answer
their questions if that happens.

23:50.346 --> 23:51.471
But it ain't gonna happen.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.266
But if the Feds do
come sniffin' around,

23:53.307 --> 23:55.475
you goin' missin'
don't look too good.

23:55.517 --> 23:58.562
All right, look, 'Keisha,
you're innocent, right?

23:58.604 --> 23:59.688
Yes.

23:59.730 --> 24:01.481
So act innocent.
Go home.

24:09.073 --> 24:10.783
Come on.

24:10.824 --> 24:13.451
We gotta go, for real.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.496
I got you.

24:16.538 --> 24:19.583
James doesn't have to cosign
to sell the stocks, Alex.

24:19.625 --> 24:22.378
Right, but that's not really
the problem, though.

24:22.420 --> 24:24.338
He already sold the stocks,

24:24.380 --> 24:27.341
so your portfolio is empty.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.986
I'll give you some privacy.

24:59.539 --> 25:02.168
Fuck.

25:25.358 --> 25:28.526
Hey, we gon' need the janitor
over here.

25:30.237 --> 25:32.948
Sorry about that...

25:32.990 --> 25:34.574
cop-killer.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.250
Come here.

25:43.292 --> 25:45.211
Where did you go?

25:45.252 --> 25:46.753
Why didn't you answer
any of my calls?

25:46.795 --> 25:49.340
Look, I needed time to think.
All right, Tasha?

25:49.382 --> 25:52.592
You came into my shop,
you blew up my life.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.594
I didn't think I owed you
an answer.

25:54.636 --> 25:57.056
You didn't give me a choice,
Tasha.

25:57.097 --> 25:59.599
You're right, 'Keisha.

25:59.641 --> 26:02.560
I'm sorry, okay?

26:02.602 --> 26:04.271
I didn't mean
for all this to happen.

26:04.313 --> 26:06.023
I was so scared; I thought
Milan was gonna kill us.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.442
Well, you don't
have to worry about Milan now.

26:08.484 --> 26:11.237
What we gotta figure out
is how you gon' get through
this thing with Ghost.

26:12.363 --> 26:14.865
Have you went to see him yet?

26:14.907 --> 26:17.284
No.
Not yet.

26:17.326 --> 26:19.078
I did it with Kadeem.

26:19.119 --> 26:23.623
When you go visit him in prison,
all that's gotta be covered up.

26:23.665 --> 26:26.626
All of it.

26:26.668 --> 26:30.089
He didn't do it.
Did he?

26:30.130 --> 26:31.631
No.

26:31.673 --> 26:33.133
A cop?
Ghost?

26:33.175 --> 26:35.428
No way.

26:35.469 --> 26:38.931
I mean, at least the Ghost
I always knew wouldn't.

26:38.972 --> 26:40.682
'Keisha, it's like...

26:40.724 --> 26:44.728
it's like I'm living in a
nightmare, and I can't wake up.

26:59.617 --> 27:01.745
You Tasha St. Patrick?
This is your home?

27:01.787 --> 27:03.830
Yes.
What is this?

27:03.872 --> 27:05.458
We have a warrant
to search the premises.

27:05.499 --> 27:07.625
Are there any minor children
present?

27:07.667 --> 27:09.878
They're not home, and--but
you--you can't just barge
in here like this.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.923
But that's actually what
this paper says, so please.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.384
Stay out of our way, ma'am.

27:26.770 --> 27:28.522
The fuck is going,
Tasha?

27:32.234 --> 27:34.694
Angela.

27:34.736 --> 27:35.821
Yeah.

27:35.862 --> 27:39.199
This bitch got
some fuckin' nerve.

27:40.742 --> 27:43.703
Just give me the word, T,
and I will beat her ass.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.539
No, no, you're not going to jail
on my watch.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.374
-Oh, fuck that bitch.
-No.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.376
Okay, just stay here, please?

27:49.418 --> 27:52.212
And keep your fool mouth shut.

27:52.254 --> 27:53.713
What the hell
are you doing here?

27:53.755 --> 27:57.009
Executing a search warrant
on the home of a murder suspect.

27:57.050 --> 27:58.760
This isn't personal.

27:58.802 --> 28:01.305
The hell it isn't.

28:01.347 --> 28:04.016
You know he wouldn't kill a cop.

28:04.057 --> 28:05.725
When it comes to Jamie, Tasha,

28:05.767 --> 28:07.727
the only thing I know
for certain

28:07.769 --> 28:09.522
is that he's capable
of anything.

28:09.563 --> 28:12.732
We both need to stop being
so surprised.

28:14.318 --> 28:17.196
Is there a weapon in the house?

28:30.167 --> 28:31.835
He was sleeping in here?

28:31.877 --> 28:35.631
I was worried he might transfer
bedbugs from your place.

28:40.719 --> 28:45.057
Put in the combination.
Let him open the door.

28:51.938 --> 28:53.566
Is it loaded?

28:53.607 --> 28:57.777
No, I wouldn't keep a loaded
weapon around children.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.740
It's--it's not
the murder weapon.

29:01.781 --> 29:03.200
-Wrong caliber.
-Okay.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.911
Bag and tag anyway.
Take it all.

29:08.830 --> 29:10.541
I don't know how you think
you have the right

29:10.583 --> 29:11.791
to come up in my mother...

29:11.833 --> 29:13.586
Jamie's actions give me
the right,

29:13.627 --> 29:16.589
and anything you say
can be used against you.

29:16.630 --> 29:19.799
Call Proctor.
Tell him to get over here.

29:19.841 --> 29:22.386
It'll protect us both.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.604
- Mm.
- Oh, look at you.

29:31.645 --> 29:33.980
- Huh? What you think?
- You lost a fuckin' bet
or something?

29:34.022 --> 29:35.815
Haha,
that's very funny guy.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.192
You look like
a fuckin' ferret.

29:37.234 --> 29:39.069
What's ferret?
Is a type of rodent, yes?

29:39.111 --> 29:42.364
-Yes, it's like a rat.
-You're hilarious.

29:42.406 --> 29:43.574
Hey.

29:49.871 --> 29:51.498
What's happening with Ghost?

29:51.540 --> 29:53.166
Situation's under control.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.544
Ghost gettin' pinched
had nothing to do
with our organization,

29:55.586 --> 29:58.297
and he ain't killed some Fed.

29:58.338 --> 30:01.592
All right, listen, I-I'll tell
everybody what's up with Ghost,

30:01.634 --> 30:03.843
and that we're the new connect
at the meet tonight.

30:03.885 --> 30:06.096
-Okay.
-Weren't you and Bratwurst

30:06.138 --> 30:08.474
were supposed to go home?
What are you even doing here?

30:08.515 --> 30:12.603
It was recommended I stay
and oversee things
until Ghost's legal woes pass.

30:12.645 --> 30:14.229
What?
Why?

30:14.271 --> 30:15.648
- Hey.
- Hey!

30:15.689 --> 30:16.898
I don't need a fuckin'
babysitter.

30:16.940 --> 30:18.858
All right, everybody
just gots to chill.

30:18.900 --> 30:22.404
This shit with Ghost is gonna be
over in a fuckin' blip.

30:22.446 --> 30:25.491
But they knew about it, huh?
That fast?

30:25.532 --> 30:27.785
Tommy, I told them.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.329
Okay, we can't be partners
if you're gonna be
a fuckin' snitch.

30:30.370 --> 30:34.541
Look, keeping secrets from our
employers is how you get killed.

30:34.583 --> 30:36.876
Keep the product moving.

30:36.918 --> 30:39.087
That's the most important thing
for both of us

30:39.129 --> 30:43.008
to keep our jobs and our lives,
do you understand?

30:47.346 --> 30:50.890
Mom?

30:50.932 --> 30:51.891
Raina.

30:53.477 --> 30:55.312
You said
you loved my dad.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.855
You said you wanted us
to live with you.

30:56.896 --> 30:58.816
What happened?
Why are you doing this?

30:58.898 --> 31:00.900
-Raina, let me explain.
-No, don't touch me.

31:09.159 --> 31:10.744
Raina!

31:24.675 --> 31:25.925
Front of your cells.

31:25.967 --> 31:28.470
Shut the fuck up for headcount.

31:31.056 --> 31:34.059
Move it, Teresi, or I'll put you
in a wheelchair.

31:34.100 --> 31:37.145
You put a hand on me, it's
the last time you'll see it.

31:42.776 --> 31:45.945
St. Patrick, night-night.

31:45.987 --> 31:47.865
It's a good count.
Lights out.

32:13.181 --> 32:17.143
All right, everybody,
listen up.

32:17.185 --> 32:20.397
All right, I know y'all heard
about Ghost, okay?

32:20.439 --> 32:23.442
But him gettin' busted ain't got
nothin' to do with this work.

32:23.483 --> 32:25.485
Saw something about
he shot a cop.

32:25.527 --> 32:27.487
- I read that
in the paper.
- That's what I heard
too.

32:27.529 --> 32:29.155
No, no, no, no, no,
Ghost not stupid enough
to kill no cop, man,

32:29.197 --> 32:30.783
no matter what the fuck
y'all heard.

32:30.824 --> 32:32.576
That's true.
It's bullshit.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.994
And more importantly, it ain't
nothin' to do with our business,

32:35.036 --> 32:36.455
so take a breath,
let your nuts drop.

32:36.496 --> 32:38.290
- We all good.

32:38.331 --> 32:41.042
Now how do we know that?

32:41.084 --> 32:43.086
That could just be
what the Feds are saying.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.004
Mr. Loco could be ratting us out
right now.

32:45.046 --> 32:47.006
- Damn straight.
- Well, he's not.

32:47.048 --> 32:49.008
'Cause he's Ghost
and he didn't do it.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.010
And you snitch up, not down.
Now come on, have a seat.

32:51.052 --> 32:55.599
So, wait, if he gives up Milan,
then we're all SOL.

32:55.641 --> 32:58.017
Ghost ain't no snitch-ass punk.

32:58.059 --> 32:59.645
Trust me,
with the lawyer he's got,

32:59.686 --> 33:01.814
he'll probably be out buying
cashmere socks by breakfast.

33:01.855 --> 33:03.356
And he couldn't give up Milan
anyway,

33:03.398 --> 33:05.024
because Milan is gone.

33:05.066 --> 33:08.027
I'm the new connect now.
I handled that shit.

33:08.069 --> 33:11.030
So what's the guy who stabbed
Shin doing here

33:11.072 --> 33:13.032
if Milan's out of the picture?

33:13.074 --> 33:14.993
I'm still working with
Petar and the rest of the Serbs.

33:15.034 --> 33:16.829
But Julio is the distro now.

33:16.870 --> 33:18.664
He'll keep you in weight,
like I always did.

33:18.705 --> 33:20.248
That's right.

33:20.290 --> 33:22.751
We gonna keep this motherfuckin'
pipeline rolling, all right?

33:22.793 --> 33:25.504
We just gonna move a couple
pick-up and drop-off spots
as a precaution, but other...

33:25.545 --> 33:28.006
But other than that,
we ain't changin' fuck-all.

33:28.047 --> 33:32.302
Keep your crews on point.
It's business as usual.

33:34.053 --> 33:35.639
Come on, let's go.

33:37.098 --> 33:39.142
Tony Teresi, 68.

33:39.184 --> 33:42.521
One count manslaughter,
one count second-degree murder.

33:42.562 --> 33:45.732
51-year sentence.

33:45.774 --> 33:47.567
It's not the first time
you've served.

33:47.609 --> 33:50.069
assault with a deadly weapon.

33:50.111 --> 33:53.072
Charges reduced to two months,
battery.

33:53.114 --> 33:56.075
Well, a menorah is not
a deadly weapon.

33:58.495 --> 34:01.039
Then there's Roberto Solletti.

34:01.080 --> 34:04.250
I was never charged
with Solletti.

34:05.961 --> 34:07.337
What do you want, John?

34:07.379 --> 34:09.965
There are at least a dozen
bodies linked to Bell Boulevard

34:10.007 --> 34:11.925
that we don't have a killer for.

34:11.967 --> 34:14.803
And I know you can give us a
name for each of those murders.

34:14.845 --> 34:20.017
Do that, and we'll see to it
that the parole board grants
an early release.

34:20.058 --> 34:24.021
Wow.
Now I never talked before.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.105
So what makes you think
I'm gonna snitch now?

34:26.147 --> 34:28.567
Because your wife
is running out of time.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.861
Her doctors gave Connie
how long?

34:30.903 --> 34:33.780
A year?
18 months?

34:33.822 --> 34:35.615
Her medical records
are confidential.

34:37.367 --> 34:40.119
I'm glad that recorder's off,
or I'd be in a lot of trouble.

34:42.539 --> 34:46.043
You wouldn't believe what
aggressive chemotherapy can do.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.587
There are a lot of
new treatments out there, Tony.

34:49.922 --> 34:51.256
Things you can get for her
on the outside.

34:51.297 --> 34:54.133
At least, you know, you could be
there for her at the end.

34:54.175 --> 34:56.135
Let me see if
I got this straight.

34:56.177 --> 35:00.766
So I talk, I come out,
she dies anyway,

35:00.807 --> 35:04.102
and now I'm a rat
for the rest of my life?

35:04.143 --> 35:06.271
Well, at least you won't miss
the funeral.

35:06.312 --> 35:10.400
Hello?
Hey, boss, you got a minute?

35:10.442 --> 35:12.736
Fuckin' piece of work.

35:14.362 --> 35:17.156
No, that is what I said.
Dissolving the trust fund.

35:17.198 --> 35:20.077
What would the tax penalty be?

35:22.203 --> 35:24.998
Even if it's just temporary?

35:25.040 --> 35:26.875
I could put it back in
a few months,

35:26.917 --> 35:29.127
just as a loan against it.

35:38.720 --> 35:41.180
Yes, I understand.

35:41.222 --> 35:43.224
I'll call you back.
Thank you.

Joe Proctor.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.256
Why am I not surprised
to see you?

36:57.298 --> 36:59.300
You know he didn't do this.

36:59.342 --> 37:00.426
You're just angry

37:00.468 --> 37:03.138
because he left you
to go back with his wife.

37:03.180 --> 37:06.265
This is revenge.
You're trying to ruin his life.

37:06.307 --> 37:09.519
That's reductive.
James ruined his own life.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.647
If you testify
against him,

37:12.689 --> 37:14.315
your career is over,
you know that?

37:14.357 --> 37:18.403
I can't prove anything I suspect
about Jamie's criminal activity.

37:18.444 --> 37:22.281
He took great care to make sure
I never saw anything
I wasn't meant to see.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.576
There was never any proof
until now.

37:24.617 --> 37:26.285
Joe Proctor!

37:26.327 --> 37:27.704
Hey, John.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.164
I'd say it's nice to see you,

37:29.206 --> 37:30.707
but I'd be lying.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.458
And that's different
for you how?

37:32.500 --> 37:35.461
Angela Valdes,
this is John Mak
from Eastern District.

37:35.503 --> 37:37.881
-Nice to meet you.
-Valdes works upstairs.

37:37.923 --> 37:40.299
Yeah, I'm sure Proctor here
is trying to weasel
a deal out of you

37:40.341 --> 37:42.301
for one of his many
guilty clients, huh?

37:42.343 --> 37:45.722
He's representing
James St. Patrick
in the Greg Knox murder trial.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.306
Mm, of course he is.

37:47.348 --> 37:48.683
And he's not guilty.

37:48.725 --> 37:51.978
Oh, of course he is.
He hired you.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.980
Nice to meet you, Valdes.

37:54.022 --> 37:55.565
Proctor, I'll see you in hell.

37:55.607 --> 37:58.110
Yeah, saving you a seat
on the bus, John.

38:51.621 --> 38:53.331
Hey, Tasha.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.418
Hey.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.339
How are the kids holding up?

39:04.425 --> 39:07.345
Angela served a search warrant
on the apartment.

39:07.386 --> 39:09.889
Raina was...
she was pretty upset.

39:09.931 --> 39:11.390
Angela was there?

39:11.432 --> 39:12.391
Yes.

39:12.433 --> 39:15.061
The cops were...
in their rooms.

39:15.103 --> 39:17.022
Went through their things.

39:17.063 --> 39:19.024
When I get out,
I'll make it up to them, okay?

39:19.065 --> 39:20.775
When I get out,
I'll make it up to all of you.

39:20.817 --> 39:24.863
There's nothing you could do
to make this up to me.

39:24.904 --> 39:27.240
Tasha.

39:27.282 --> 39:29.408
Tasha, I didn't do this.

39:30.702 --> 39:33.038
Look, Proctor asked me
to get the bail money.

39:33.079 --> 39:35.414
I went to the bank.
Mm-hmm.

39:35.456 --> 39:37.416
- There's nothing there.
-Yeah.

39:37.458 --> 39:39.752
- You didn't tell me.
-  -Uh, look, sorry, okay?

39:39.794 --> 39:41.796
I thought I'd have time to...

39:41.838 --> 39:43.422
put the money back in.

39:43.464 --> 39:45.424
You know what?
I found a necklace.

39:45.466 --> 39:48.220
Is that something I should sell?

39:49.929 --> 39:51.430
It wouldn't be enough.

39:51.472 --> 39:53.183
Hm.

39:54.600 --> 39:57.478
There's nothing to put up
for collateral, James.

39:57.520 --> 40:01.983
I mean, I looked into dissolving
the trust, but the penalty...

40:02.025 --> 40:03.735
We rent the apartment.

40:03.776 --> 40:07.864
And you don't own the building
at Truth.

40:14.495 --> 40:17.415
We could get the money
from Dean.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.378
- Dean?
- Mm-hmm.

40:21.419 --> 40:24.547
Go get my money back from Dean.
Dean, okay?

40:24.589 --> 40:26.716
Talk to him as soon
as you can, Tash.
Go now.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.593
- Wait... I don't understand.
- You gotta go right
now.

40:28.634 --> 40:32.680
There's a service he didn't
render, so ask Dean

40:32.722 --> 40:34.682
for my money back.

40:44.525 --> 40:46.652
I'm sure Proctor
will ask for bail.

40:46.694 --> 40:48.196
Well, I don't think
he'll get it.

40:48.238 --> 40:49.697
The guy killed a federal agent.

40:49.739 --> 40:51.657
The judge could consent
to an ankle bracelet.

40:51.699 --> 40:54.493
It's not the strongest
arrest warrant I've ever seen.

40:54.535 --> 40:56.495
But fingerprints and DNA
are pretty good,

40:56.537 --> 40:58.497
as far as a jury is concerned.

40:58.539 --> 41:00.792
A local business owner
with no record.

41:00.833 --> 41:05.338
His first crime is murdering
an FBI agent in cold blood?

41:05.380 --> 41:07.465
You don't think he did it?

41:10.427 --> 41:11.636
I think he did it.

41:11.677 --> 41:14.055
I also think we're going to
have a high bar.

41:14.097 --> 41:15.974
You'll sit second chair to me
and we'll make sure

41:16.015 --> 41:18.601
Angela's not a dis...traction.

41:18.643 --> 41:20.228
Angela.

41:23.564 --> 41:27.819
You may be sitting second chair
for appearances,

41:27.860 --> 41:29.528
but this is my case.

41:29.570 --> 41:31.489
Hm, if it's about appearances,

41:31.530 --> 41:32.824
then you shouldn't even be
in this room.

41:32.865 --> 41:35.534
You were fucking the defendant
and the victim.

41:35.576 --> 41:37.454
I'd say that makes you
a little compromised.

41:37.495 --> 41:40.332
We wouldn't even have a suspect
if it weren't for me.

41:40.373 --> 41:42.000
John.
What are you doing here?

41:42.041 --> 41:43.542
Just got a new assignment.

41:43.584 --> 41:45.544
I'll be sitting first chair
on the St. Patrick case.

41:45.586 --> 41:47.797
No, no fucking way.

41:47.839 --> 41:50.800
No offense, John,
but this is our case.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.551
You know, Collins and my boss
had a little chat

41:52.593 --> 41:55.138
about the appearance
of impartiality in this case.

41:55.180 --> 41:59.267
I mean, between Lobos'
death and the subsequent
Main Justice investigation,

41:59.309 --> 42:00.852
I'd say you guys are
a little compromised.

42:00.893 --> 42:05.523
Yeah, you moved pretty fast.
I heard you were on Teresi.

42:05.564 --> 42:07.900
Yeah, I was.
But you know me.

42:07.942 --> 42:09.110
I go where the work is.

42:09.152 --> 42:11.237
You go where the cameras are.

42:11.279 --> 42:12.613
Yeah, they're often
in the same place.

42:12.655 --> 42:15.741
Look, I want a conviction
as much as you do.

42:15.783 --> 42:18.536
After today, we'll be working
out of my offices.

42:18.577 --> 42:22.207
Sandoval, you'll sit
as my second chair.

42:22.248 --> 42:24.667
Hey, we have a detention hearing
tomorrow, right?

42:24.709 --> 42:28.546
Let's get to work.
Angela, your office?

42:32.675 --> 42:34.511
I've been going over
the case files.

42:34.552 --> 42:38.597
Very detailed, professional.
Smart work.

42:38.639 --> 42:40.933
You know, despite
your conflict of interest,

42:40.975 --> 42:43.769
they would have never gotten
this far without you.

42:44.979 --> 42:47.190
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

42:47.232 --> 42:50.651
I'm gonna need you to be
an integral part
of this case, Angela.

42:50.693 --> 42:52.611
Now, we both know
this isn't just about

42:52.653 --> 42:55.614
convicting St. Patrick
over Greg Knox's murder.

42:55.656 --> 42:57.992
The reputation of the entire
office is on the line.

42:58.034 --> 42:59.327
Where do you want to start?

42:59.369 --> 43:01.246
Let's go backwards.

43:01.287 --> 43:03.331
Now, you knew both
St. Patrick and Knox,

43:03.373 --> 43:05.624
but did they know each other
personally?

43:05.666 --> 43:07.377
They only met once.

43:07.419 --> 43:11.381
And Greg was following a lead
at St. Patrick's nightclub.

43:11.423 --> 43:12.882
It was official FBI work.

43:12.924 --> 43:14.842
Any history of antagonism
between them?

43:14.884 --> 43:19.138
Greg was very focused on St.
Patrick as a narcotics suspect,

43:19.180 --> 43:21.807
but their direct contact
was limited.

43:21.849 --> 43:24.269
Except the day Greg died,

43:24.310 --> 43:26.645
St. Patrick told me that
Greg pulled him over.

43:26.687 --> 43:28.273
There's some motive right there.

43:28.314 --> 43:31.609
Do you have Knox's log?

43:31.650 --> 43:34.653
Greg didn't log the stop.

43:34.695 --> 43:37.198
-It seems it was off the books.
-Or it didn't happen.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.576
Why would St. Patrick lie to me
about that?

43:39.617 --> 43:41.453
Why wouldn't he lie to you?

43:41.494 --> 43:44.497
From what I hear,
he lied to you quite a bit.

43:44.539 --> 43:45.998
Now, before we continue,

43:46.040 --> 43:48.126
I'm gonna need you
to go over your timeline

43:48.167 --> 43:50.002
and separate truth from fact.

43:50.044 --> 43:52.338
Names, dates, explanations.

43:52.380 --> 43:54.799
After you do that,
we can reconvene.

43:56.384 --> 43:58.928
So, does that mean
I'm third chair, then?

43:58.970 --> 44:02.223
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I guess I was unclear.

44:02.265 --> 44:06.018
You know, as much as I need
your help on this, Angela,

44:06.060 --> 44:08.687
I mean, you do know you can't be
on it officially.

44:08.729 --> 44:13.025
We don't even know
if Proctor's gonna call you up
as his witness.

44:13.067 --> 44:15.528
I mean, your conflict
of interest is pretty clear.

44:15.570 --> 44:19.240
Now, we don't want to hand
Proctor an appellate issue
on a platter, do we?

44:19.282 --> 44:20.699
Hm?

44:26.789 --> 44:29.125
When you're done, go wipe down
the bar over there, all right?

44:29.167 --> 44:30.668
You got it.

44:31.752 --> 44:33.712
Yo, yo.
What's good, Dre?

44:33.754 --> 44:35.423
- What up, what up?
- This is Sue.

44:35.465 --> 44:37.467
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

44:39.760 --> 44:42.680
Mama, do me a favor.
Go, uh...go wait for me
over there.

44:44.641 --> 44:46.643
You know we can communicate
through text, right?

44:46.684 --> 44:48.060
You shouldn't be here
on the regular, man.

44:48.102 --> 44:49.728
I don't want my staff
knowin' your face.

44:49.770 --> 44:51.564
I don't need your girl
knowin' mine.

44:51.606 --> 44:53.274
Oh, I ain't stayin' long.

44:53.316 --> 44:54.733
And that's not my girl, bro.

44:54.775 --> 44:57.736
I mean, she looks like a pro.

44:57.778 --> 45:01.449
Yeah, well, not anymore.

45:01.491 --> 45:02.950
No, she works here now.

45:04.785 --> 45:07.746
Oh, so you're doin' the hiring
on the legit side, huh?

45:07.788 --> 45:10.958
Okay...does she even know
how to mix a drink?

45:11.000 --> 45:13.628
You can teach her, right?

45:13.670 --> 45:15.338
Someone taught you.

45:19.592 --> 45:21.386
I'm, um...

45:21.427 --> 45:23.304
Ghost put me in charge
of this shit.

45:23.346 --> 45:25.764
And Tommy left me
in charge of everything.

45:25.806 --> 45:27.517
I'll talk to Ghost about it
when he gets out.

45:27.559 --> 45:31.770
But for now, dude,
just get her a uniform.

45:31.812 --> 45:33.272
Okay?

45:39.820 --> 45:41.989
He said we could get the money
from Dean.

45:42.031 --> 45:43.782
But that's Milan, right,
and Milan is dead,

45:43.824 --> 45:45.784
so how are we gonna get
the money back from him?

45:45.826 --> 45:47.161
Are you sure
that's what he said?

45:47.203 --> 45:49.788
Yes.
His exact words were,

45:49.830 --> 45:52.625
"We can get the money back
from Dean."

45:52.667 --> 45:54.377
The money back...

45:54.419 --> 45:56.212
Wait.

45:56.254 --> 45:58.297
Get the money back?

45:58.339 --> 46:00.216
Yes.

46:00.258 --> 46:03.760
He means the money that we paid
to the security firm.

46:03.802 --> 46:05.555
Wait a minute.
That was for Milan?

46:05.597 --> 46:06.805
You never told me that.

46:06.847 --> 46:08.349
You weren't supposed to know
about Milan.

46:08.391 --> 46:09.601
Ghost didn't want to scare you.

46:09.642 --> 46:11.810
Yeah, well,
I'm fuckin' scared now.

46:13.062 --> 46:14.855
I don't get it.
Still.

46:14.897 --> 46:16.857
I mean, how are gonna get
the money back from him?

46:16.899 --> 46:19.902
From Petar...but there's
no reason for him to do it.

46:19.944 --> 46:22.655
It's not his problem;
Ghost's not part
of the business no more.

46:22.697 --> 46:24.823
As long as I move his weight,
he good.

46:24.865 --> 46:26.992
God.

46:27.034 --> 46:30.663
If Ghost goes to jail,
it's gonna be way harder
to move that weight, Tommy.

46:30.705 --> 46:34.875
Make Petar understand
this is his problem now.

46:37.878 --> 46:40.423
It's not about
what I want to do, Tommy.

46:40.465 --> 46:42.300
When we decided to be partners,

46:42.341 --> 46:46.262
I told you we have people
to answer to in Chicago
and Belgrade.

46:46.304 --> 46:47.888
How do I explain giving
the money back,

46:47.930 --> 46:52.059
especially to help Ghost,
who is not part
of our business?

46:52.101 --> 46:54.604
Helping Ghost helps everyone.

46:54.646 --> 46:56.855
Ghost fires Dean and asked
for his money back.

46:56.897 --> 46:58.899
That explains
Dean's disappearance.

46:58.941 --> 47:00.985
If the Feds start asking
about Milan,

47:01.026 --> 47:03.070
we got a ready-made bedtime
story for them.

47:03.112 --> 47:05.864
I mean, you're an accomplice
in Milan's murder, Petar.

47:05.906 --> 47:07.700
So are the people in Chicago,

47:07.742 --> 47:10.869
since they signed off
before we pulled the trigger.

47:10.911 --> 47:14.457
You help Ghost,
you're protecting everybody.

47:17.042 --> 47:18.877
I will get you the money.

47:28.179 --> 47:30.765
Oh, nice.
And you're sure this is clean?

47:30.807 --> 47:32.475
Petar wired it from
the security company,

47:32.517 --> 47:34.393
so on paper,
it looks like reimbursement.

47:34.435 --> 47:37.938
Yo, so, Julio has this girl
that he wants me to hire
as a waitress.

47:37.980 --> 47:39.982
She was turning tricks
for Dylan up in his spot

47:40.024 --> 47:40.941
before Ghost clipped him.

47:40.983 --> 47:43.902
-Yeah.
-I gotta hire her?

47:43.944 --> 47:46.280
Yeah, he's distro now.
Do what he says.

47:46.322 --> 47:47.906
Yo, why him over me?

47:47.948 --> 47:51.369
I held you down with taking care
of Ruiz and knocking off Milan.

47:51.410 --> 47:54.539
Dre, J's been in the game
with us for years.

47:54.580 --> 47:57.458
You show up a couple of months
ago, you think you ready
to be a distro?

47:57.500 --> 47:59.918
Yeah.
I am ready.

47:59.960 --> 48:03.381
Look, Tommy, I've been real
with you since day one, man.

48:03.422 --> 48:04.923
Okay.

48:04.965 --> 48:08.927
In that case,
who the hell is Slim?

48:08.969 --> 48:10.929
For real.

48:12.431 --> 48:14.099
Nobody.

48:14.141 --> 48:17.936
All right, look, like 'Riq said,
he made it up.

48:17.978 --> 48:20.606
And besides, man,
we found the kid.

48:20.648 --> 48:21.982
He's back.

48:22.024 --> 48:23.942
You know,
that's all that matters, right?

48:23.984 --> 48:25.528
Right.

48:25.570 --> 48:27.946
Well, when Ghost gets out
tomorrow,

48:27.988 --> 48:30.366
we'll all have a little chat
about it.

6794545-DM-184.

49:06.026 --> 49:08.738
United States of America
versus James St. Patrick.

49:08.780 --> 49:12.991
I'm informed there are
two counts on the pre-indictment
criminal complaints.

49:13.033 --> 49:14.911
Are you prepared to enter a plea
at this time?

49:14.951 --> 49:16.245
Yes, Your Honor.

49:16.287 --> 49:17.996
St. Patrick, on the count
of first-degree murder

49:18.038 --> 49:20.332
in the death of Gregory Knox,
and the count

49:20.374 --> 49:22.710
of carrying a firearm
in the commission of a crime...

49:22.752 --> 49:24.837
-How do you plead?
-Not guilty, Your Honor.

49:24.879 --> 49:28.340
Would
the Government like to be heard
on the matter of detention?

49:28.382 --> 49:29.759
Yes, Your Honor.

49:29.801 --> 49:31.719
The defendant killed
Special Agent Greg Knox

49:31.761 --> 49:34.054
with full knowledge
of his law enforcement status.

49:34.096 --> 49:36.014
We request detention
of the defendant.

49:36.056 --> 49:38.559
Your Honor, this
whole proceeding is laughable.

49:38.601 --> 49:42.480
Their evidence against my client
for the Knox murder is thin,
at best.

49:42.521 --> 49:46.066
Well, I admit it's not
the thickest warrant application
I've ever read, Mr. Mak.

49:46.108 --> 49:48.486
I'd hardly call
St. Patrick's DNA

49:48.527 --> 49:51.029
under Agent Knox's fingernails
thin evidence.

49:51.071 --> 49:53.073
His fingerprints were also found
at the scene.

49:53.115 --> 49:55.326
On the exterior of a window,
Your Honor.

49:55.367 --> 49:58.871
No physical evidence my client
was ever inside the apartment.

49:58.913 --> 50:02.333
No witnesses, no record
of his vehicle in the area,

50:02.374 --> 50:07.045
no gunshot residue or blood on
the clothes he wore that night.

50:07.087 --> 50:10.048
What did he wear to do it?
A tear-away hazmat suit?

50:10.090 --> 50:12.677
Your Honor, would you please
remind Mr. Proctor

50:12.718 --> 50:15.262
that evidence is not an issue
for setting bail?

50:15.304 --> 50:19.725
Untrue. With a case this flimsy,
my client has no motive to flee.

50:19.767 --> 50:21.686
We'll beat this
without breaking a sweat.

50:21.727 --> 50:24.939
Electronic monitoring, then?
Split the baby.

50:24.981 --> 50:28.567
Your Honor, no condition
or combination of conditions

50:28.609 --> 50:30.235
can protect the public here.

50:30.277 --> 50:34.991
Mr. St. Patrick is a wealthy man
with unlimited resources
for escape.

50:35.031 --> 50:36.951
And a wife and three children.

50:36.993 --> 50:38.953
Is he gonna take them
on the run too?

50:38.995 --> 50:41.455
He killed a federal agent.
He's capable of anything.

50:41.497 --> 50:44.124
While I appreciate
your enthusiasm, Mr. Mak,

50:44.166 --> 50:47.837
Mr. St. Patrick doesn't appear
to be much of a flight risk.

50:47.879 --> 50:49.755
House arrest seems appropriate.

50:49.797 --> 50:52.633
Even the pre-trial
services report suggests

50:52.675 --> 50:54.092
strong ties to the community.

50:54.134 --> 50:55.594
Children in private school,

50:55.636 --> 50:57.930
lifelong residence
in New York City.

50:57.972 --> 51:00.599
Your Honor, there is no
greater danger to the community

51:00.641 --> 51:05.396
than a man who enters the home
of a trained armed member
of law enforcement

51:05.437 --> 51:08.900
and executes him efficiently,
with malice aforethought.

51:08.941 --> 51:10.108
No ordinary citizen is safe

51:10.150 --> 51:13.111
with a man like
James St. Patrick on the street.

51:13.153 --> 51:15.364
A man
like James St. Patrick?

51:15.406 --> 51:18.617
You mean an African-American
father and husband

51:18.659 --> 51:20.411
with a successful business?

51:20.452 --> 51:22.120
He is an ordinary citizen.

51:22.162 --> 51:25.750
He shouldn't be treated better
or worse than anyone else.

51:27.001 --> 51:29.461
It is an egregious crime,
Mr. Proctor.

51:29.503 --> 51:33.507
And there has to be some remedy
in the courts, some deterrent,

51:33.549 --> 51:37.219
to convince people that killing
a member of law enforcement

51:37.261 --> 51:39.179
has grave consequences.

51:39.221 --> 51:40.138
Yeah, Your Honor...

51:40.180 --> 51:41.515
Bail is denied, Mr. Proctor.

51:41.557 --> 51:45.143
Your client is remanded
into custody to await trial.

51:49.565 --> 51:51.191
Sorry, James.

51:51.233 --> 51:52.693
Listen, you stay cool,
no matter what happens in there.

51:52.735 --> 51:53.986
I'm gonna get you out.

51:57.823 --> 51:59.075
What just happened?

51:59.115 --> 52:01.077
It means I'm not coming home,
okay?

52:01.117 --> 52:03.161
You got this, okay?

52:07.959 --> 52:09.835
-Nice work, man.
-Excellent.

52:09.877 --> 52:10.920
We'll get him.

52:12.212 --> 52:14.048
You can't really think
I did this.

52:14.090 --> 52:17.133
