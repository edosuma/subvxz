were driving a forklift,

but you don't have
a driver's license?

and fly spaceships,

I got the job at Miller's, so...

Actually, I was listening
to one of my Lenny Bruce albums,

33:46.241 --> 33:47.677
and on it
he's doing this bit

33:47.677 --> 33:49.853
that I've heard
a thousand times,

33:49.853 --> 33:52.073
I mean, I could do it
word for word.

33:52.073 --> 33:54.728
And for some reason,
I heard it differently

33:54.728 --> 33:56.686
than any other time
before that.

33:56.686 --> 33:58.253
So I'm at my house,

33:58.253 --> 34:01.604
just...laughing to myself,
and it hit me.

34:01.604 --> 34:03.998
I realized that the reason
it was so different

34:03.998 --> 34:07.349
because what he was saying
was absolutely the truth.

34:07.349 --> 34:10.264
And the truth in itself
is funny.

I'm at work the next day,

34:13.485 --> 34:15.574
on my forklift,

34:15.574 --> 34:17.967
and I just start laughing.

controllaughing, and I couldn't
stop.

like, running down my face,

and I'm crashing into things,

are running for their lives.

for a living.

34:34.855 --> 34:37.553

it took me 17 years to realize
it

34:40.295 --> 34:43.907
was just...
Heh, it was hysterical.

34:46.214 --> 34:48.303

34:48.303 --> 34:50.436
and-and they looked at
my record,

34:50.436 --> 34:53.221
and they saw that I had
no driving credentials,

34:53.221 --> 34:55.353
so they, uh,
they-they let me go.

a broken family,

55:09.871 --> 55:12.091
he stopped talking
to his family years ago.

have kids,

55:16.400 --> 55:17.662

the restaurant
