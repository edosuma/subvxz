00:01.831 --> 00:03.291
Previously on "The Path"...

00:03.292 --> 00:04.375
‐ Eddie Lane?

00:04.376 --> 00:05.835
Chloe.
It's Chloe Jones.

00:05.836 --> 00:08.213
‐ Hey, it was great
to see you the other day.

00:08.214 --> 00:09.798
‐ Bidding will begin
on the building

00:09.799 --> 00:11.299
at 899 Bradbush.

00:11.300 --> 00:12.592
Do I hear 3.5 million?

00:12.593 --> 00:13.885
4.8, I have 4.8.

00:13.886 --> 00:16.012
‐ No, okay, just leave it
at that, please.

00:16.013 --> 00:17.055
You're not gonna believe this.

00:17.056 --> 00:18.264
‐ What did he buy it for?

00:18.265 --> 00:21.059
‐ Five.
‐ How could you let this happen?

00:21.060 --> 00:22.519
I'm not a good person.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.562
You're pregnant.
How far along?

00:24.563 --> 00:26.397
‐ About five months.

00:26.398 --> 00:28.650
‐ I have learned to live
with most of your lies,

00:28.651 --> 00:29.999
but I won't accept
your story about Silas.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.640
But I won't accept
your story about Silas.

00:34.573 --> 00:36.866
‐ You,

00:36.867 --> 00:38.409
you're the son.

00:38.410 --> 00:40.286
Who was this?

00:40.287 --> 00:42.581
The man who killed Steve.

01:30.588 --> 01:33.798
What do you see?

01:33.799 --> 01:35.384
A body.

01:36.635 --> 01:39.804
Mangled.

01:39.805 --> 01:43.433
Innocent.

01:43.434 --> 01:46.978
What are you feeling now?

01:46.979 --> 01:49.898
Cold.

01:49.899 --> 01:51.941
Frightened.

01:51.942 --> 01:54.819
Can you tell me
where that lives,

01:54.820 --> 01:57.572
in your body?

01:57.573 --> 01:59.198
In my hands.

01:59.199 --> 02:00.000
They're shaking so bad,
and I don't know what to do.

02:00.001 --> 02:02.041
They're shaking so bad,
and I don't know what to do.

02:05.998 --> 02:08.416
Stay with that.

02:08.417 --> 02:10.126
Your hands.

02:10.127 --> 02:13.421
I bury it.

02:13.422 --> 02:15.965
I put its body in the hole.

02:15.966 --> 02:18.509
Head pointing east
to receive the sunrise,

02:18.510 --> 02:21.512
as is our custom.

02:21.513 --> 02:24.349
It's the only way.

02:24.350 --> 02:26.601
But the weight of it.

02:26.602 --> 02:28.354
Can you locate that?

02:31.857 --> 02:35.610
In my chest.

02:35.611 --> 02:37.362
My heart.

02:37.363 --> 02:45.363
‐ Are you available for me
to share an opinion now?

02:46.121 --> 02:47.664
‐ Yes.

02:47.665 --> 02:51.042
‐ Your empathy
for the animal is real.

02:51.043 --> 02:53.211
But I'm intuiting some leakage

02:53.212 --> 02:57.507
from the damage
of your break‐up.

02:57.508 --> 02:59.133
‐ Not everything has to do

02:59.134 --> 03:00.000
with my split from Eddie.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.552
With my split from Eddie.

03:00.553 --> 03:02.845
‐ And what about
his trip to Peru?

03:02.846 --> 03:05.014
After your split?

03:05.015 --> 03:06.808
That must have
stirred things up.

03:06.809 --> 03:08.726
Were you aware of
his trip to Peru?

03:08.727 --> 03:10.395
‐ Eddie didn't go to Peru.

03:10.396 --> 03:12.647
‐ Maybe I'm mistaken.
It was something I heard.

03:12.648 --> 03:14.732
‐ I don't understand.

03:14.733 --> 03:15.900
Who would say that?

03:15.901 --> 03:16.985
‐ One of the locals

03:16.986 --> 03:19.737
described seeing someone.

03:19.738 --> 03:21.072
I thought it might be him.

03:21.073 --> 03:22.657
‐ It wasn't.

03:22.658 --> 03:24.742
If Eddie went to Peru,
I would know about it.

03:24.743 --> 03:26.119
‐ Are you speaking with him?

03:26.120 --> 03:28.538
‐ Of course not.

03:28.539 --> 03:29.999
Eddie's a Denier.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.249
Eddie's a Denier.

03:30.250 --> 03:31.666
Deniers are shunned.

03:31.667 --> 03:34.293
That's our way.

03:34.294 --> 03:35.420
‐ We can get ice cream?

03:35.421 --> 03:37.588
‐ You just had a snow cone.

03:37.589 --> 03:39.090
‐ It's hot.

03:39.091 --> 03:41.092
‐ You want to be as pumped
full of sugar and chemicals

03:41.093 --> 03:42.468
as the rest of these
I. S. kids?

03:42.469 --> 03:44.888
‐ Hey, maybe later,
sweetie, all right?

03:47.850 --> 03:49.892
Maybe you should have
an ice cream.

03:49.893 --> 03:52.395
You haven't eaten
anything all day.

03:52.396 --> 03:56.232
‐ I'm fasting.
My AL retreat's this week.

03:56.233 --> 03:57.483
‐ Wow.

03:57.484 --> 03:59.999
You're moving along.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.863
You're moving along.

04:00.864 --> 04:03.072
‐ It's not a competition, Dad.

04:03.073 --> 04:05.908
We all walk together.

04:05.909 --> 04:07.243
‐

04:07.244 --> 04:10.788
‐ They won't tell us
what happens on it.

04:10.789 --> 04:12.373
‐ Yeah, how it works.

04:12.374 --> 04:13.499
‐ Dad.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.500
Dad, come here.

04:14.501 --> 04:15.960
Yeah?

04:15.961 --> 04:16.961
‐ Please?

04:16.962 --> 04:18.921
‐ Oh, you want that?

04:18.922 --> 04:20.214
Oh, all right.

04:20.214 --> 04:21.466
Um.

04:21.466 --> 04:22.884
But you got to promise

04:22.885 --> 04:25.011
you're not gonna ask me for
anything else

04:25.012 --> 04:26.512
for the rest of the day, okay?

04:26.513 --> 04:28.473
‐ I promise.
‐ Okay.

04:28.474 --> 04:29.999
‐ You're the best dad
in the whole world.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.476
‐ You're the best dad
in the whole world.

04:30.477 --> 04:33.436
‐ You're the best.

04:33.437 --> 04:36.356
All right, here you go.
Thank you.

04:36.357 --> 04:37.523
Summer.

04:37.524 --> 04:40.319
Here you go.

04:43.238 --> 04:44.655
Oh, you know what?
Uh...

04:44.656 --> 04:47.450
We should actually
probably get going.

04:47.451 --> 04:48.785
I didn't realize
how late it was.

04:48.786 --> 04:50.661
We don't want to
miss the train, come on.

04:50.662 --> 04:53.498
Come on, kid.

04:53.499 --> 04:56.167
They're increasing
their presence in the city.

04:56.168 --> 04:57.877
Not just with bodies,

04:57.878 --> 04:59.212
but with real estate.

04:59.213 --> 05:00.000
‐ They're buying property
in the city?

05:00.000 --> 05:00.798
‐ They're buying property
in the city?

05:00.799 --> 05:03.674
‐ They grabbed a building
in Canarsie

05:03.675 --> 05:05.635
at an auction
through a holding company

05:05.636 --> 05:08.012
that we were able to link

05:08.013 --> 05:09.138
to Cal Roberts.

05:09.139 --> 05:10.681
‐ This is the new leader?

05:10.682 --> 05:12.016
‐ Yes.

05:12.017 --> 05:14.018
He's become the focus
of my investigation.

05:14.019 --> 05:16.229
‐ It's not a federal crime
to buy real estate.

05:16.230 --> 05:17.730
It's just smart.

05:17.731 --> 05:19.524
‐ We know that this man
is capable of

05:19.525 --> 05:20.691
violent assault.

05:20.692 --> 05:22.819
We suspect
he's capable of murder,

05:22.820 --> 05:24.529
but we can't get him
on any of that.

05:24.530 --> 05:27.115
‐ Right, so we'll go after him
on the financial side.

05:27.116 --> 05:28.282
Easier to track.

05:28.283 --> 05:29.867
‐ He just filed an application

05:29.868 --> 05:30.000
for tax‐exempt status
with the IRS.

05:30.001 --> 05:32.662
For tax‐exempt status
with the IRS.

05:32.663 --> 05:34.455
‐ Of course.
As a religion.

05:34.456 --> 05:35.374
‐ Right.

05:35.375 --> 05:38.376
Well, if that goes through,

05:38.377 --> 05:40.586
he'll be hard to stop.

05:40.587 --> 05:42.046
But if it doesn't,

05:42.047 --> 05:43.714
we put him up against a wall,

05:43.715 --> 05:46.008
we force him into
financial impropriety.

05:46.009 --> 05:47.385
And with his ego,

05:47.386 --> 05:48.886
with his arrogance‐‐

05:48.887 --> 05:51.681
‐ Oh, but we can't let it
go through, can we?

05:51.682 --> 05:55.893
I'll contact our friends
over in Internal Revenue.

05:55.894 --> 05:57.061
‐ I appreciate that.

05:57.062 --> 05:58.229
‐ You can count on
the full support

05:58.230 --> 05:59.689
of the US Attorney's Office.

05:59.690 --> 06:00.000
And me, personally,
I consider this a huge priority.

06:00.001 --> 06:02.567
And me, personally,
I consider this a huge priority.

06:02.568 --> 06:03.818
You're a sharp guy.

06:03.819 --> 06:05.111
It's a shame you let the Bureau

06:05.112 --> 06:09.198
keep you in the basement
for so long.

06:09.199 --> 06:12.076
‐ Yes, it is.

06:12.077 --> 06:14.036
‐ I love you so much, kiddo.

06:14.037 --> 06:15.413
‐ You too, Dad.

06:15.414 --> 06:16.664
‐ Fiercely and forever.

06:16.665 --> 06:23.421
‐ Fiercely and forever.

06:23.422 --> 06:25.423
Hey, uh, thank you

06:25.424 --> 06:29.999
for, uh...

06:30.000 --> 06:30.345
for, uh...

06:30.346 --> 06:31.471
Hey.

06:31.472 --> 06:33.681
Are you, uh...

06:33.682 --> 06:35.349
Is everything all right?

06:35.350 --> 06:36.684
What is it?

06:36.685 --> 06:38.936
‐ Nothing.
I'm fine.

06:38.937 --> 06:41.314
‐ You don't look fine.

06:41.315 --> 06:42.773
Sarah, come on.

06:42.774 --> 06:44.609
What's going on?

06:44.610 --> 06:47.778
‐ Just, um...

06:47.779 --> 06:50.198
Had a session with Richard, so.

06:50.199 --> 06:52.241
You know, it stirred things up.

06:52.242 --> 06:53.951
‐ Okay.

06:53.952 --> 06:56.579
What‐‐what things?

06:56.580 --> 06:58.290
What is it?

07:00.751 --> 07:02.585
‐ I can't.

07:02.586 --> 07:04.003
Eddie.

07:04.004 --> 07:06.255
‐ Yes, you can.
Come on.

07:06.256 --> 07:08.633
What?
Hey, what?

07:08.634 --> 07:11.052
‐ No, this.

07:11.053 --> 07:12.511
This is.

07:12.512 --> 07:14.013
Okay?
We're standing

07:14.014 --> 07:15.473
in the middle of a fucking park,

07:15.474 --> 07:18.142
exchanging our kids
like it's a drug deal.

07:18.143 --> 07:19.644
And I am supposed
to be running things.

07:19.645 --> 07:21.771
I am a Guardian of The Light,
but instead

07:21.772 --> 07:23.065
this is happening.

07:29.321 --> 07:30.000
Isn't this enough?

07:30.001 --> 07:33.616
Isn't this enough?

07:33.617 --> 07:34.659
‐ Hey.

07:34.660 --> 07:36.619
Hey, hey, hey, Sarah.

07:36.620 --> 07:37.913
‐

07:46.213 --> 07:47.213
Good morning, Cal.

07:47.214 --> 07:50.258
It's Lisa Jackson.

07:50.259 --> 07:52.051
I'm so sorry

07:52.052 --> 07:53.177
to be calling with,

07:53.178 --> 07:55.388
uh, not‐so‐good news.

07:55.389 --> 07:57.556
But I'll go ahead and
just rip off the Band‐Aid.

07:57.557 --> 07:59.892
Uh, I'm afraid your application

07:59.893 --> 08:00.000
for tax‐exempt status

08:00.001 --> 08:01.519
for tax‐exempt status

08:01.520 --> 08:03.479
has hit a bump,

08:03.480 --> 08:05.481
well, uh, more than a bump.

08:05.482 --> 08:07.441
It's going to be, uh...

08:07.442 --> 08:10.027
more complicated than I thought.

08:10.028 --> 08:13.072
I'm sorry if I overpromised,

08:13.073 --> 08:15.157
but they're telling me

08:15.158 --> 08:17.243
it's a no‐go.

08:17.244 --> 08:19.161
Okay.
Uh, hope you're great.

08:19.162 --> 08:20.205
Um, bye then.

08:21.957 --> 08:23.541
‐ Aren't you busy in the city?

08:23.542 --> 08:29.999
‐ I‐‐ yeah, I needed to see you.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.048
‐ I‐‐ yeah, I needed to see you.

08:31.049 --> 08:33.592
Um...

08:33.592 --> 08:34.844
How are you?

08:34.845 --> 08:37.722
‐ I don't know.

08:37.722 --> 08:41.350
I had an unburdening session
with Richard.

08:41.351 --> 08:42.727
And of course,

08:42.727 --> 08:44.729
it was incomplete.

08:44.730 --> 08:46.105
I wanted to tell him everything.

08:46.106 --> 08:48.649
‐ Well, yes.
That‐‐that impulse is‐‐

08:48.650 --> 08:49.942
it's understandable, but

08:49.943 --> 08:52.236
to act on it
would be catastrophic.

08:52.237 --> 08:53.279
You know that.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.615
‐ Every time I close my eyes,

08:55.616 --> 08:56.741
I relive it.

08:56.742 --> 08:59.999
‐ Our tax‐exempt status
was denied.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.246
‐ Our tax‐exempt status
was denied.

09:02.247 --> 09:04.582
‐ You said that you were sure,

09:04.583 --> 09:05.958
that it was all but approved.

09:05.959 --> 09:07.585
‐ No, it‐‐it was‐‐
it was supposed to be.

09:07.586 --> 09:08.794
Um, it's
religious discrimination

09:08.795 --> 09:10.254
is what it is.
‐ Jesus Christ.

09:10.255 --> 09:11.756
‐ And we will fight‐‐
‐ This is why Steven said

09:11.757 --> 09:13.299
never to get involved
with the government.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.259
‐ Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
‐ I told you this.

09:15.260 --> 09:16.469
‐ Steve may have been right,

09:16.470 --> 09:18.429
and‐‐and you
may have been right.

09:18.430 --> 09:20.598
But in the meantime,

09:20.599 --> 09:22.975
the‐‐the money situation,

09:22.976 --> 09:25.436
uh... is critical.

09:25.437 --> 09:26.812
‐ How critical?

09:26.813 --> 09:28.314
‐ Um...

09:28.315 --> 09:29.999
Kerry Ridge is throwing together
a fundraiser in the city.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.484
Kerry Ridge is throwing together
a fundraiser in the city.

09:31.485 --> 09:32.610
A flashy thing.

09:32.611 --> 09:34.612
You know, all her rich friends.

09:34.613 --> 09:36.864
Uh...

09:36.865 --> 09:38.908
We need it.

09:38.909 --> 09:42.620
And I need you there.

09:42.621 --> 09:43.996
‐ No.

09:43.997 --> 09:46.040
I am not good at these things,

09:46.041 --> 09:47.958
and especially not now.

09:47.959 --> 09:50.961
‐ I know you are suffering.

09:50.962 --> 09:52.463
But we‐‐we have to

09:52.464 --> 09:54.423
put the needs of The Movement

09:54.424 --> 09:55.549
above our needs.

09:55.550 --> 09:59.999
We‐‐we‐‐we have
a responsibility.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.138
We‐‐we‐‐we have
a responsibility.

10:00.139 --> 10:02.473
‐ You're talking to me
about responsibility?

10:02.474 --> 10:04.975
‐ They will turn the lights off.

10:04.976 --> 10:07.019
They will take the compound.

10:07.020 --> 10:08.437
That is‐‐that‐‐

10:08.438 --> 10:11.692
that is how critical it is.

10:13.527 --> 10:15.486
Please.

10:15.487 --> 10:17.154
‐ I can't.

10:17.155 --> 10:18.365
‐ Please.

10:29.584 --> 10:30.000
‐

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
‐

11:05.996 --> 11:07.705
‐ Once you decide on a size,

11:07.706 --> 11:10.166
then we, uh, got to start
looking at 4K,

11:10.167 --> 11:12.085
HDR, Rec 2020...

11:13.462 --> 11:14.587
If you're going for that

11:14.588 --> 11:16.088
cinematic experience,

11:16.089 --> 11:18.048
I suggest the one
that's in front of you, sir.

11:18.049 --> 11:19.551
1216...

11:21.762 --> 11:23.012
Smart TV.

11:23.013 --> 11:24.680
So it has a 4K resolution...

11:24.681 --> 11:27.726
Totally sharp...

11:29.478 --> 11:30.000
‐

11:30.000 --> 11:30.854
‐

11:30.855 --> 11:32.939
‐ Or playing games with it...

11:38.487 --> 11:39.946
‐ Stop!

11:46.745 --> 11:49.538
I'm sorry, I... sorry.

11:49.539 --> 11:51.749
Just trying to

11:51.750 --> 11:55.753
get a TV for my kids, and I...

11:55.754 --> 11:58.547
just been away for so long,
and...

11:58.548 --> 11:59.999
there are so many choices.
I didn't realize that, uh...

12:00.000 --> 12:02.092
there are so many choices.
I didn't realize that, uh...

12:02.093 --> 12:04.470
‐ You were‐‐ you were locked up?

12:04.471 --> 12:05.430
‐ Uh...

12:05.431 --> 12:07.723
No, it wasn't, wasn't‐‐

12:07.724 --> 12:10.768
‐ My uncle was locked up
for 30 years.

12:10.769 --> 12:13.938
‐ Well, actually, yeah.

12:13.939 --> 12:15.981
Kinda, I guess.

12:15.982 --> 12:17.859
That's pretty much it.

12:20.821 --> 12:22.446
‐ Are you sure about this?
‐ No problem.

12:22.447 --> 12:24.907
Are you kidding?
Take them off my hands, please.

12:24.908 --> 12:26.617
I'm not doing this anymore.

12:26.618 --> 12:28.619
Oh, I love you,

12:28.620 --> 12:29.662
but Mommy is done.

12:29.663 --> 12:30.000
‐ I only need one.

12:30.000 --> 12:30.789
‐ I only need one.

12:30.790 --> 12:32.289
Nothing fits me anymore.

12:32.290 --> 12:34.416
‐ Oh, that's nice on you.

12:34.417 --> 12:35.876
‐ I like it.
‐ Yeah.

12:35.877 --> 12:37.336
‐ I just don't know
if it's appropriate.

12:37.337 --> 12:40.214
Never been to
a fancy fundraiser before.

12:40.215 --> 12:41.924
What are you wearing?

12:41.925 --> 12:43.467
‐ Uh, we're not going.

12:43.468 --> 12:45.052
‐ I'm in charge of
the AL retreat tonight, so...

12:45.053 --> 12:46.387
No can do.

12:46.388 --> 12:48.389
‐ Yeah, also,
we weren't invited.

12:48.390 --> 12:51.809
So Russel is stuck babysitting
the 1Rs on their camp‐out,

12:51.810 --> 12:54.353
and I'm stuck babysitting
everybody else.

12:54.354 --> 12:56.063
‐ It's not babysitting,
it's awesome.

12:56.064 --> 12:59.692
You'll get just as much
out of it as the 1Rs do.

12:59.693 --> 13:00.000
‐ All right, sweetheart.
I know, I know.

13:00.001 --> 13:02.278
‐ All right, sweetheart.
I know, I know.

13:02.279 --> 13:06.115
I know, buddy.
There you go.

13:06.116 --> 13:07.491
‐ Sorry.

13:07.492 --> 13:09.201
It's just,
that's the craziest thing.

13:09.202 --> 13:10.536
‐ I know.

13:10.537 --> 13:12.663
When you haven't done it before,

13:12.664 --> 13:15.791
it's like magic
what the body can do.

13:15.792 --> 13:18.586
You forget.

13:18.587 --> 13:20.462
‐ Can I ask you something?

13:20.463 --> 13:21.339
‐ Sure.

13:21.340 --> 13:23.340
‐ Your kids, you're...

13:23.341 --> 13:25.885
you're a mixed race.
Um...

13:25.886 --> 13:27.845
Do the kids look‐‐

13:27.846 --> 13:29.999
I don't know how to say it.
Um...

13:30.000 --> 13:30.390
I don't know how to say it.
Um...

13:30.391 --> 13:31.765
‐ Asian?

13:31.766 --> 13:33.183
You can say it.

13:33.184 --> 13:34.685
Now, just don't say "oriental"

13:34.686 --> 13:36.270
'cause that's for rugs,

13:36.271 --> 13:38.188
not people.

13:38.189 --> 13:39.398
I know they‐‐

13:39.399 --> 13:41.609
they all have
a different mix of us.

13:41.610 --> 13:43.027
And this one,

13:43.028 --> 13:45.488
she's all Russel.

13:54.372 --> 13:56.540
Holy cow.

13:56.541 --> 13:58.167
‐ You look like a movie star.

13:58.168 --> 13:59.999
‐ It's just a dress.

14:00.000 --> 14:00.170
‐ It's just a dress.

14:00.171 --> 14:01.754
‐ Has anybody seen my daughter?

14:01.755 --> 14:03.589
I swear she went upstairs
a few minutes ago

14:03.590 --> 14:05.132
and then this femme fatale
appeared.

14:05.133 --> 14:08.093
‐ You're embarrassing me.

14:08.094 --> 14:09.094
Is it too much?

14:09.095 --> 14:10.220
I was wondering about the hair.

14:10.221 --> 14:11.513
‐ I love the hair.

14:11.514 --> 14:13.974
‐ You look gorgeous.
Don't sweat it.

14:13.975 --> 14:16.101
‐ I just want to
feel like myself.

14:16.102 --> 14:18.228
‐ You always look gorgeous
to me, honey.

14:18.229 --> 14:22.567
No matter what you're wearing.

14:26.863 --> 14:29.999
‐ Um...
I'm gonna take this outside.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.914
‐ Um...
I'm gonna take this outside.

14:48.093 --> 14:49.426
What are you doing?

14:49.427 --> 14:53.347
My parents are just inside.

14:53.348 --> 14:55.516
‐ Are you...

14:55.517 --> 14:58.310
you going somewhere?

14:58.311 --> 14:59.999
‐ It's work.

15:00.000 --> 15:00.105
‐ It's work.

15:00.106 --> 15:03.357
There's a fundraiser
in the city.

15:03.358 --> 15:05.192
‐ Uh‐huh.

15:05.193 --> 15:06.944
You going with Cal?

15:06.945 --> 15:10.864
‐ What do you want, Eddie?

15:10.865 --> 15:13.283
‐ Look,

15:13.284 --> 15:15.285
I was worried

15:15.286 --> 15:18.038
about you.

15:18.039 --> 15:19.873
You seemed off

15:19.874 --> 15:21.834
to me.

15:21.835 --> 15:24.002
But clearly,

15:24.003 --> 15:26.296
you are fine.

15:26.297 --> 15:27.631
Right?

15:27.632 --> 15:29.999
I mean, you're more than fine.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.760
I mean, you're more than fine.

15:31.761 --> 15:33.637
I am sorry.

15:33.638 --> 15:37.433
‐ In my session with Richard...

15:37.434 --> 15:39.768
‐ What?

15:39.769 --> 15:43.647
What are you saying to him
about us?

15:43.648 --> 15:46.692
‐ Did you go to Peru?

15:46.693 --> 15:48.152
‐ What?

15:48.153 --> 15:49.987
‐ Richard said that there's talk
that you were there.

15:49.988 --> 15:52.990
‐ Richard is a goddamn liar.

15:52.991 --> 15:54.867
I shouldn't have come here.

15:54.868 --> 15:56.119
Have a good night.

16:17.515 --> 16:18.932
You've heard a lot about light

16:18.933 --> 16:20.350
in The Movement.

16:20.351 --> 16:22.519
The Light is what we strive for,

16:22.520 --> 16:26.315
what we aspire
to bring to the world.

16:26.316 --> 16:29.486
Light's pretty much our favorite
metaphor around here.

16:30.862 --> 16:32.863
But light isn't just
a figure of speech

16:32.864 --> 16:35.032
we Meyerists happen to like.

16:35.033 --> 16:37.367
It's a material thing.

16:37.368 --> 16:39.787
A necessity,
light is what we rely upon

16:39.788 --> 16:41.789
to move through the world.

16:41.790 --> 16:43.832
Without it,

16:43.833 --> 16:44.265
we lose our bearings.

16:44.266 --> 16:45.542
We lose our bearings.

16:45.543 --> 16:48.879
And we can even lose our minds.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.256
The truth is,

16:51.257 --> 16:55.803
we can't always count on light
to be there for us,

16:55.804 --> 17:00.307
to soften the corners
of our dangerous world.

17:00.308 --> 17:02.559
But tonight,

17:02.560 --> 17:06.730
the big secret of the AL
is finally out.

17:06.731 --> 17:10.651
Tonight, on the darkest
night of the year,

17:10.652 --> 17:12.944
the dead moon,

17:12.945 --> 17:14.263
I will need

17:14.265 --> 17:15.073
I will need

17:15.074 --> 17:17.491
your matches, your flashlights,

17:17.492 --> 17:18.909
your lanterns, your candles,

17:18.910 --> 17:20.410
anything you might
have brought with you

17:20.411 --> 17:21.662
to give you warmth

17:21.663 --> 17:24.039
or light, to ease your journey.

17:24.040 --> 17:28.001
Tonight,
you'll have to find the light

17:28.002 --> 17:30.838
inside of you.

17:30.839 --> 17:32.047
Good luck.

17:32.048 --> 17:34.467
And I'll see you
on the other side.

17:41.641 --> 17:44.264
These are the people
who saved my son's life.

17:44.265 --> 17:44.310
These are the people
who saved my son's life.

17:44.311 --> 17:47.062
- They are angels on Earth.
- ‐

17:47.063 --> 17:48.981
‐ Our practices
are very effective

17:48.982 --> 17:51.233
in combating addiction.
‐ Mm.

17:51.234 --> 17:53.944
‐ Mary here was heavily addicted
when she joined us.

17:53.945 --> 17:57.906
Exploited and abused,
now she's clean and stable

17:57.907 --> 17:59.408
thanks to our program.

17:59.409 --> 18:01.618
‐ And the love of my husband.

18:01.619 --> 18:02.911
Still a struggle though.

18:02.912 --> 18:05.455
‐ Ah,
it's a one‐day‐at‐a‐time thing.

18:05.456 --> 18:07.374
‐ Mm.

18:07.375 --> 18:08.709
Well, we're also, uh,

18:08.710 --> 18:10.919
heavily involved in
social justice issues.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.463
Uh, right here in the city,
we have an epidemic

18:13.464 --> 18:14.265
of homelessness.

18:14.265 --> 18:14.465
Of homelessness.

18:14.466 --> 18:15.883
Now, some of that

18:15.884 --> 18:17.301
is connected to mental illness,

18:17.302 --> 18:19.469
but an awful lot of it
is simply lack of access

18:19.470 --> 18:21.221
to things the rest of us
take for granted.

18:21.222 --> 18:22.973
‐ Oh.
Thank God.

18:22.974 --> 18:26.185
I was dying for a drink.
‐ Oh, me too.

18:26.186 --> 18:27.477
‐ No, thank you.

18:27.478 --> 18:32.149
‐ I'll have one, thank you.

18:32.150 --> 18:36.361
If you don't mind.

18:36.362 --> 18:38.030
‐ Yes, as I was saying, uh...

18:38.031 --> 18:40.741
I'm so happy
you finally called me,

18:40.742 --> 18:42.034
eventually.

18:42.035 --> 18:44.264
Yeah, you know, it's just, uh...

18:44.265 --> 18:44.662
Yeah, you know, it's just, uh...

18:44.663 --> 18:47.789
it's pretty busy, and‐‐
and with the kids, it's just...

18:47.790 --> 18:49.708
‐ Yeah.

18:49.709 --> 18:51.168
Well,
I was starting to think that

18:51.169 --> 18:53.837
maybe I was coming on
a little too strong.

18:53.838 --> 18:55.130
‐ Oh, no, no, no, no.
‐ Something like,

18:55.131 --> 18:56.882
I was too forward or something.
‐ No.

18:56.883 --> 18:58.300
It wasn't that.

18:58.301 --> 19:00.052
‐ Good.

19:00.053 --> 19:02.763
And then I thought
you, maybe, uh...

19:02.764 --> 19:04.765
you thought it would be
a little weird because

19:04.766 --> 19:08.185
I was with your brother, and...

19:08.186 --> 19:09.645
I mean, we were so young,

19:09.646 --> 19:10.729
you know, we were just kids,

19:10.730 --> 19:12.397
but I wasn't sure if you‐‐

19:12.398 --> 19:13.982
‐ I mean‐‐hone‐‐

19:13.983 --> 19:14.265
Honestly, everything feels

19:14.266 --> 19:17.027
Honestly, everything feels

19:17.028 --> 19:19.529
a little weird.
Um...

19:19.530 --> 19:22.741
But it's nice to do something
that feels right.

19:22.742 --> 19:26.787
And calling you up

19:26.788 --> 19:30.290
felt right.

19:30.291 --> 19:31.709
‐ Yeah?

19:33.169 --> 19:35.254
‐ You know, imagine not being
able to drink water

19:35.255 --> 19:37.714
from your own tap, you know,

19:37.715 --> 19:40.592
not being able to bathe
your children in it.

19:40.593 --> 19:42.177
‐ It's terrible.
Just terrible.

19:42.178 --> 19:44.221
I can't imagine.
‐ I don't want to.

19:44.222 --> 19:44.263
‐ We were able to
bring safe water directly

19:44.264 --> 19:45.931
‐ We were able to
bring safe water directly

19:45.932 --> 19:47.391
to the residents of Clarksville,

19:47.392 --> 19:49.226
but hopefully
that's just the beginning.

19:49.227 --> 19:51.061
We want to be advocates

19:51.062 --> 19:52.646
for a long‐term solution.

19:52.647 --> 19:54.898
But that's gonna require
more resources.

19:54.899 --> 19:57.567
‐ Suzanne, Matthew,
I'm so glad you could come.

19:57.568 --> 19:58.694
Sarah.

19:58.695 --> 20:01.405
Listen,
I have a question for you.

20:01.406 --> 20:05.284
‐ You are exquisite.

20:05.285 --> 20:08.412
How is it
we've never met before?

20:08.413 --> 20:11.623
Been to a lot of
these functions.

20:11.624 --> 20:13.750
‐ I've already told you,
it's a no.

20:13.751 --> 20:14.265
And it will be all night.

20:14.266 --> 20:17.463
And it will be all night.

20:25.096 --> 20:26.430
Excuse me.
‐ Hi.

20:26.431 --> 20:28.140
‐ Hi, it seems to be
getting pretty late.

20:28.141 --> 20:30.100
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah, I'm wondering,

20:30.101 --> 20:31.560
when we should get to the ask.

20:31.561 --> 20:33.145
‐ I'm sorry?

20:33.146 --> 20:35.147
‐ Asking for contributions.
Everyone seems to be gathered...

20:35.148 --> 20:37.816
‐ Oh, no, we weren't
going to do an ask tonight.

20:37.817 --> 20:39.401
This is more of, um...

20:39.402 --> 20:42.112
more of a friend‐raiser
than a fundraiser.

20:42.113 --> 20:43.780
‐ I'm sorry?

20:43.781 --> 20:44.265
‐ Trust me, you don't want to
seem desperate with this crowd.

20:44.266 --> 20:46.158
‐ Trust me, you don't want to
seem desperate with this crowd.

20:46.159 --> 20:47.618
It'll only scare them off.

21:07.680 --> 21:08.972
Where are we?

21:08.973 --> 21:09.973
We're not that far.

21:09.974 --> 21:12.059
It's just like... steps.

21:12.060 --> 21:13.518
But how do you know that?

21:13.519 --> 21:14.265
We can't see shit.
We could be anywhere.

21:14.265 --> 21:14.854
We can't see shit.
We could be anywhere.

21:14.855 --> 21:16.104
This is a nightmare.

21:16.105 --> 21:20.108
What was that?

21:20.109 --> 21:21.526
Nothing.

21:21.527 --> 21:24.321
A... far away‐‐a‐‐a dog?

21:24.322 --> 21:27.240
That's not a dog.

21:27.241 --> 21:29.076
It's a fucking
spider‐‐get it off me!

21:29.077 --> 21:30.869
No, it's not‐‐it's not‐‐
it's not a spider.

21:30.870 --> 21:32.037
It's not a spider.

21:32.038 --> 21:33.663
We have to use our other senses,

21:33.664 --> 21:35.123
like‐‐like touch.

21:35.124 --> 21:37.459
It's just a branch, see?

21:37.460 --> 21:38.960
I can't fucking see anything.

21:38.961 --> 21:44.264
I meant feel.

21:44.265 --> 21:45.265
I meant feel.

21:45.718 --> 21:48.011
What are you doing?

21:48.012 --> 21:49.513
That‐‐that's cheating.

21:49.514 --> 21:53.016
‐ I can't do the dark.

21:53.017 --> 21:54.435
‐ That's‐‐that's why...

21:56.062 --> 21:58.897
We do this.

21:58.898 --> 22:00.941
Darkness is the scariest thing.

22:00.942 --> 22:03.693
That's no reason to
give up on ourselves.

22:03.694 --> 22:05.862
‐ I'm not like you, Hawk.

22:05.863 --> 22:08.323
‐ What does that mean?

22:08.324 --> 22:09.866
‐ You were brought up here,

22:09.867 --> 22:12.953
in this loving
circle of paradise.

22:12.954 --> 22:14.264
When I was eight years old,
my mom used to leave me

22:14.265 --> 22:15.206
When I was eight years old,
my mom used to leave me

22:15.207 --> 22:18.375
with a German Shepherd
as a babysitter

22:18.376 --> 22:19.918
for days.

22:19.919 --> 22:21.545
She would say,
"If something happens,

22:21.546 --> 22:26.007
you know where
I keep the gun."

22:26.008 --> 22:29.010
‐ That's really horrible.

22:29.011 --> 22:30.637
‐ It was fine in the day,

22:30.638 --> 22:34.224
but at night...

22:34.225 --> 22:38.061
So I'm sorry, but I'm terrified.

22:38.062 --> 22:41.314
‐ I'm‐‐I'm... terrified too.

22:41.315 --> 22:42.732
‐ No, you're not.

22:42.733 --> 22:44.067
This is like your DNA.

22:44.068 --> 22:44.265
‐ No.

22:44.266 --> 22:45.986
‐ No.

22:45.987 --> 22:48.905
No, I'm completely freaked out.

22:48.906 --> 22:52.409
I mean, nothing in my life
makes sense anymore.

22:52.410 --> 22:53.452
My parents are a mess.

22:53.453 --> 22:55.745
Everything's just ripped apart.

22:55.746 --> 22:59.875
I... found someone

22:59.876 --> 23:05.338
that I loved and I lost her.

23:05.339 --> 23:08.425
And I just thought
that this night would‐‐

23:08.426 --> 23:10.427
I don't know,
being out here in the dark...

23:10.428 --> 23:11.720
If I could survive this,

23:11.721 --> 23:14.264
then maybe I'd wake up...
somewhere

23:14.265 --> 23:16.433
then maybe I'd wake up...
somewhere

23:16.434 --> 23:17.684
or pass through something

23:17.685 --> 23:23.440
or figure shit out.

23:23.441 --> 23:24.774
I‐I don't‐‐

23:24.775 --> 23:26.568
It's dumb.

23:26.569 --> 23:27.736
I don't know what
I was thinking.

23:27.737 --> 23:35.737
Nothing's gonna happen.

23:44.265 --> 23:46.088
Nothing's gonna happen.

23:56.015 --> 23:59.643
‐ Give me gratitude.

23:59.644 --> 24:02.062
Show me Light.

24:02.063 --> 24:04.814
Surround me with love.

24:04.815 --> 24:06.566
Make me‐‐
‐ Make me a vessel of The Truth

24:06.567 --> 24:11.321
so I may find my Light
in all my days.

24:11.322 --> 24:14.032
Hey, you keep looking at it.

24:14.033 --> 24:14.265
You want to touch him?

24:14.266 --> 24:16.701
You want to touch him?

24:16.702 --> 24:17.954
You can.

24:34.720 --> 24:36.846
You hate them, don't you?

24:36.847 --> 24:38.890
Those people in there.

24:38.891 --> 24:40.517
‐ I wouldn't say hate.

24:40.518 --> 24:44.264
‐ You need their money, so
you have to make them feel good,

24:44.265 --> 24:44.311
‐ You need their money, so
you have to make them feel good,

24:44.312 --> 24:45.689
treat them like
they're not the assholes

24:45.690 --> 24:47.482
they know deep down
they really are.

24:47.483 --> 24:49.359
‐ That's not‐‐ it's not

24:49.360 --> 24:51.194
quite how it works.

24:51.195 --> 24:54.322
‐ Really?

24:54.323 --> 24:55.365
‐ Excuse me.

24:55.366 --> 25:03.366
There's a pregnant woman here.

25:05.209 --> 25:07.502
‐ I brought you a, uh, water.

25:07.503 --> 25:12.757
‐ Thanks, I'd love some.

25:12.758 --> 25:14.264
‐ I'll let you two, uh...

25:14.265 --> 25:16.721
‐ I'll let you two, uh...

25:17.722 --> 25:19.098
Excuse me.

25:25.730 --> 25:27.772
‐ You like
doing construction, huh?

25:27.773 --> 25:29.441
‐ Yeah.
No, it's great.

25:29.442 --> 25:31.943
You know, I get to...

25:31.944 --> 25:33.820
I get to work with my hands.
It's simple work.

25:33.821 --> 25:37.157
‐ Mm.
‐ I‐‐uh, watch something go up.

25:37.158 --> 25:38.867
‐ Yeah, Johnny did
construction, didn't he?

25:38.868 --> 25:40.535
‐ Yeah, our old man taught us.

25:40.536 --> 25:42.412
Yeah, he could build
a house from studs.

25:42.413 --> 25:44.264
He could put in everything from

25:44.265 --> 25:45.249
He could put in everything from

25:45.250 --> 25:47.208
electrical to plumbing.

25:47.209 --> 25:48.585
You know, until the‐‐

25:48.586 --> 25:50.629
the drinking got bad, but‐‐

25:50.630 --> 25:53.715
um, yeah, you know.

25:53.716 --> 25:55.425
Still getting
back into the swing of it,

25:55.426 --> 25:57.093
but, yeah, it's nice.
‐ Right.

25:57.094 --> 25:59.596
There's a couple things
that I'm dying to ask you.

25:59.597 --> 26:01.556
‐ Go ahead.
What?

26:01.557 --> 26:03.433
‐ Okay, um...

26:03.434 --> 26:05.018
In your, like,

26:05.019 --> 26:07.437
movement, the thing...
‐ Mm‐hmm.

26:07.438 --> 26:08.813
‐ Did you have any, like,

26:08.814 --> 26:11.358
rituals that
you had to do, like,

26:11.359 --> 26:14.264
any, like,
sex stuff or anything?

26:14.265 --> 26:14.320
Any, like,
sex stuff or anything?

26:14.321 --> 26:17.280
‐ I mean,
it was a religious, uh,

26:17.281 --> 26:18.448
community.

26:18.449 --> 26:19.783
It wasn't‐‐

26:19.784 --> 26:21.534
wasn't that weird.
‐ Hm.

26:21.535 --> 26:23.703
Well, the girls at the salon
told me

26:23.704 --> 26:25.538
that there was this group

26:25.539 --> 26:28.041
that if you disobeyed
their leader,

26:28.042 --> 26:31.795
he'd make you lick the floor
with your tongue.

26:31.796 --> 26:33.213
So, I mean,

26:33.214 --> 26:36.383
it's no wonder
you'd get a little...

26:36.384 --> 26:41.429
‐ A little what?

26:41.430 --> 26:42.847
‐ A little jumpy.
I mean...

26:42.848 --> 26:44.264
I mean, not that you're‐‐
‐ A little jump?

26:44.265 --> 26:44.475
I mean, not that you're‐‐
‐ A little jump?

26:44.476 --> 26:45.975
‐ No I'm not saying that‐‐
‐ A little jumpy.

26:45.976 --> 26:47.310
‐ You're not jumpy, I'm just‐‐

26:47.311 --> 26:48.520
‐ Is that what this‐‐
‐ You could be.

26:48.521 --> 26:50.730
‐ Is that what this is?
You...

26:50.731 --> 26:53.024
Are you trying to find
dirt on me so you can

26:53.025 --> 26:54.818
trade it at the salon?
I mean...

26:54.819 --> 26:56.236
‐ No.
‐ What?

26:56.237 --> 26:58.488
‐ Absolutely not, Eddie, no.
‐ What is it then?

26:58.489 --> 27:00.490
‐ No, I...

27:00.491 --> 27:02.784
I just‐‐I want to know
what you've

27:02.785 --> 27:06.037
gone through, you know?
‐

27:06.038 --> 27:08.498
Yeah.
‐ I'm sorry, I shouldn't have

27:08.499 --> 27:10.292
said anything.
‐ No, it's...

27:11.460 --> 27:12.669
What are you doing?

27:12.670 --> 27:14.264
‐ I'm not gonna be
your sideshow.

27:14.265 --> 27:15.505
‐ I'm not gonna be
your sideshow.

27:15.506 --> 27:16.589
This was a mistake.

27:16.590 --> 27:18.801
‐ Eddie.

27:22.513 --> 27:25.849
Eddie?

27:25.850 --> 27:27.434
Eddie!

27:27.435 --> 27:30.520
Please.
Wait, please.

27:30.521 --> 27:32.188
Eddie, just stop, please.

27:32.189 --> 27:34.107
I'm sorry.

27:34.108 --> 27:35.567
I'm just...

27:35.568 --> 27:36.985
I didn't mean that stuff.

27:36.986 --> 27:38.778
I shouldn't have said
any of that stuff.

27:38.779 --> 27:40.613
‐ Listen,
I can't explain the world

27:40.614 --> 27:41.865
I was in, okay?

27:41.866 --> 27:44.264
I know it's different.

27:44.265 --> 27:44.410
I know it's different.

27:44.411 --> 27:45.827
It always will be.

27:45.828 --> 27:48.913
‐ You don't have to
explain it to me, okay?

27:48.914 --> 27:50.373
Look, after Johnny died‐‐

27:50.374 --> 27:51.708
‐ No, can we please not do this?

27:51.709 --> 27:52.917
I don't want to do this.
‐ Listen to me.

27:52.918 --> 27:55.378
Eddie, listen to me, please.

27:55.379 --> 27:58.840
When Johnny died, I had nothing.

27:58.841 --> 28:01.384
I had no answers

28:01.385 --> 28:03.386
as to why it happened.

28:03.387 --> 28:05.555
I had no one, I just...

28:05.556 --> 28:09.142
I had nowhere to go.

28:09.143 --> 28:10.393
And you?

28:10.394 --> 28:12.395
You found somewhere

28:12.396 --> 28:13.396
to go.

28:13.397 --> 28:14.265
I mean, you...

28:14.266 --> 28:15.565
I mean, you...

28:15.566 --> 28:18.610
you found a place
that has the answers

28:18.611 --> 28:22.071
that you need, you know?

28:22.072 --> 28:23.699
It probably saved your life.

28:25.743 --> 28:27.702
‐ Yeah.
It did.

28:27.703 --> 28:28.995
‐ Yeah.

28:28.996 --> 28:32.373
Who's gonna judge you
for that, huh?

28:32.374 --> 28:36.544
Not me.

28:36.545 --> 28:39.005
‐ It‐‐they, uh...

28:39.006 --> 28:41.257
did save me.

28:41.258 --> 28:43.968
And it was beautiful

28:43.969 --> 28:44.265
for so long to have a story

28:44.266 --> 28:47.305
for so long to have a story

28:47.306 --> 28:51.142
that just contained it.

28:51.143 --> 28:53.186
You know, it just

28:53.187 --> 28:55.647
held it all.

28:55.648 --> 28:57.941
But it only works

28:57.942 --> 29:00.777
when you believe.

29:00.778 --> 29:03.780
Because once you pull
that thread,

29:03.781 --> 29:07.200
it just turns into nothing

29:07.201 --> 29:09.745
right in your hands.

29:36.230 --> 29:38.606
‐ Uh, what exactly is
private equity?

29:38.607 --> 29:40.400
‐ You sure you want to know?

29:40.401 --> 29:42.360
‐ I'm asking.

29:42.361 --> 29:45.947
‐ I'm just afraid it might be
a little too interesting.

29:45.948 --> 29:47.490
You might not
be able to handle it.

29:47.491 --> 29:48.491
‐

29:48.492 --> 29:52.328
I can handle a lot.

29:52.329 --> 29:54.206
‐ If I could get
your attention, please.

29:55.666 --> 29:57.543
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

29:59.003 --> 30:01.379
Now, don't worry, you can
all go back to drinking

30:01.380 --> 30:02.937
and complaining about
the commute to your summer homes

30:02.938 --> 30:03.799
and complaining about
the commute to your summer homes

30:03.800 --> 30:05.842
- in just a second.
- ‐

30:05.843 --> 30:07.635
‐ I want to talk to you
for just a moment

30:07.636 --> 30:09.429
about the purpose
of this evening,

30:09.430 --> 30:10.430
why you're here,

30:10.431 --> 30:11.681
other than the fact that

30:11.682 --> 30:13.891
someone you consider
socially desirable

30:13.892 --> 30:15.310
invited you.

30:15.311 --> 30:17.562
Half a mile from here
in Canarsie,

30:17.563 --> 30:20.189
there are 30 young Novices

30:20.190 --> 30:22.567
sleeping on a concrete floor,

30:22.568 --> 30:23.776
dedicating themselves

30:23.777 --> 30:26.696
to the social mission
of our movement.

30:26.697 --> 30:28.615
They are sacrificing

30:28.616 --> 30:30.366
and slaving

30:30.367 --> 30:31.701
to make a haven

30:31.702 --> 30:32.937
for the homeless of this city,

30:32.938 --> 30:33.621
for the homeless of this city,

30:33.622 --> 30:35.580
the sick, the disabled,

30:35.581 --> 30:36.789
the forgotten,

30:36.790 --> 30:40.043
uh... people you walk past

30:40.044 --> 30:41.461
every day in the street

30:41.462 --> 30:42.754
and avert your eyes.

30:42.755 --> 30:46.132
We are intervening,

30:46.133 --> 30:49.052
making a difference,

30:49.053 --> 30:55.266
uh, saving lives.

30:55.267 --> 30:56.976
It takes conscience.

30:56.977 --> 30:59.228
It takes commitment.

30:59.229 --> 31:01.898
An unwillingness to turn away.

31:01.899 --> 31:02.937
That's why I'm asking you

31:02.938 --> 31:03.734
That's why I'm asking you

31:03.735 --> 31:05.401
right now, all of you,

31:05.402 --> 31:09.238
to reach into
your pockets and give.

31:09.239 --> 31:13.117
Give deeply.
Um...

31:13.118 --> 31:14.535
Consider‐‐

31:14.536 --> 31:16.913
consider how little
that money means to you.

31:16.914 --> 31:18.956
It's another status handbag,

31:18.957 --> 31:21.334
some obscenely expensive
bottle of wine

31:21.335 --> 31:22.669
you buy and show off
at a dinner party.

31:22.670 --> 31:24.170
To the people we're helping,

31:24.171 --> 31:26.255
it could mean the difference
between life and death.

31:26.256 --> 31:28.466
‐ All right.
Thank you, Cal.

31:28.467 --> 31:30.301
That was illuminating

31:30.302 --> 31:31.427
for all of us.

31:31.428 --> 31:32.937
Now it's my job to ask you all

31:32.938 --> 31:34.013
Now it's my job to ask you all

31:34.014 --> 31:35.848
to go back to enjoying yourself.

31:35.849 --> 31:37.558
And just as a reminder,

31:37.559 --> 31:39.770
the bar's still very much open.

32:04.586 --> 32:09.549
‐

32:09.550 --> 32:14.053
‐ Couldn't take the guilt trip
in there either, huh?

32:14.054 --> 32:22.054
‐ It was rough.

32:32.938 --> 32:35.117
‐ It was rough.

32:38.120 --> 32:39.413
‐ It's okay.

32:45.502 --> 32:51.340
‐ Oh, God.

32:51.341 --> 32:55.678
‐

32:55.679 --> 32:57.388
You know, I, uh...

32:57.389 --> 33:01.267
I better clean up the place.
My God, I'm such a slob.

33:01.268 --> 33:02.602
‐ It's fine, it's fine.

33:02.603 --> 33:02.938
It looks‐‐it looks good.

33:02.939 --> 33:04.437
It looks‐‐it looks good.

33:04.438 --> 33:05.980
‐ I really‐‐

33:05.981 --> 33:07.356
I really wasn't planning on‐‐

33:07.357 --> 33:08.566
‐ Oh, no, good.

33:08.567 --> 33:09.734
I wouldn't want you to think

33:09.735 --> 33:11.360
I was a sure bet or anything.

33:11.361 --> 33:13.696
‐ I mean, look I...

33:13.697 --> 33:16.240
I would never as‐‐assume

33:16.241 --> 33:17.408
anything.

33:17.409 --> 33:18.910
Uh, and, you know, you can leave

33:18.911 --> 33:20.328
anytime you want.

33:20.329 --> 33:21.871
‐ No.
No.

33:21.872 --> 33:24.332
Johnny's with his dad tonight.

33:24.333 --> 33:26.376
This is happening.

35:11.481 --> 35:13.566
‐ You okay?

35:13.567 --> 35:17.196
‐ I can't do this.

35:24.328 --> 35:26.204
‐ This is how
you talk to my friends?

35:26.205 --> 35:27.496
My business contacts?

35:27.497 --> 35:29.081
‐ I may have spoken
a little strongly.

35:29.082 --> 35:30.583
‐ You can't ask people for money

35:30.584 --> 35:32.210
while your indicting
everything they stand for.

35:32.211 --> 35:32.938
‐ I'm sure he didn't mean it.

35:32.938 --> 35:33.337
‐ I'm sure he didn't mean it.

35:33.338 --> 35:34.795
He was being rhetorical.

35:34.796 --> 35:37.048
‐ My business
runs on relationships.

35:37.049 --> 35:38.090
You threatened that in here.

35:38.091 --> 35:39.842
‐ Honey, he's sorry.

35:39.843 --> 35:41.385
Cal, you're sorry, right?

35:41.386 --> 35:43.596
‐ You thought you had a big fish
reeled in, didn't you?

35:43.597 --> 35:45.348
Well, you just lost
our business.

35:45.349 --> 35:46.766
‐ I am not a business person.

35:46.767 --> 35:48.142
I am a religious leader.

35:48.143 --> 35:49.769
‐ I don't think
you're a leader at all.

35:49.770 --> 35:51.103
‐ John.

35:51.104 --> 35:53.064
‐ Oh, looks like someone
had fun tonight at least.

35:53.065 --> 35:54.523
So the evening wasn't
a total lost.

35:54.524 --> 35:56.317
‐ Should get you home.
‐ No, I'm‐‐

35:56.318 --> 35:58.319
Excuse me, I haven't
even said thank you

35:58.320 --> 35:59.528
to our hosts.

35:59.529 --> 36:01.364
Thank you for
the beautiful party.

36:01.365 --> 36:02.907
‐ All right, I think that's
enough, come on, let's go‐‐

36:02.908 --> 36:02.936
‐ You know what, don't grab me,
I'm fine.

36:02.937 --> 36:04.533
‐ You know what, don't grab me,
I'm fine.

36:04.534 --> 36:06.410
‐ Hey.

36:06.411 --> 36:07.453
Hi.

36:07.454 --> 36:08.537
Are you leaving?

36:08.538 --> 36:10.289
You're gonna split on me now?

36:10.290 --> 36:11.540
You going somewhere?

36:11.541 --> 36:14.377
‐ Um...
I have to go.

36:14.378 --> 36:20.383
‐ Well, you can give me
your number or something.

36:20.384 --> 36:22.301
‐ She's not giving you
anything, okay?

36:22.302 --> 36:23.344
‐ Oh, really?

36:23.345 --> 36:24.888
She was a few minutes ago.

36:26.390 --> 36:30.519
She was a few minutes ago.

37:10.267 --> 37:11.934
‐ Hey.

37:11.935 --> 37:14.687
Can't sleep?

37:14.688 --> 37:16.188
‐ Yeah.

37:16.189 --> 37:21.485
‐ What's going on?

37:21.486 --> 37:23.487
‐ I did not like that tonight.

37:23.488 --> 37:26.282
Him just trotting us out
in front of all those people,

37:26.283 --> 37:27.589
his little success stories.

37:27.590 --> 37:28.035
His little success stories.

37:28.036 --> 37:30.036
That didn't feel bad to you?

37:30.037 --> 37:32.371
‐ No.

37:32.372 --> 37:34.999
I'm just so used to feeling

37:35.000 --> 37:37.960
ashamed of everything
that's happened to me.

37:37.961 --> 37:40.129
Felt good to have
someone show me off.

37:40.130 --> 37:41.714
Be proud of
what I've been through.

37:41.715 --> 37:43.257
‐ I don't want to
take that away from you.

37:43.258 --> 37:45.468
All right?
I'm just...

37:45.469 --> 37:47.136
I mean, what gives him the right

37:47.137 --> 37:49.472
to‐‐to touch you like that?
‐ Like what?

37:49.473 --> 37:51.891
‐ You know what I mean,
like he owns you.

37:51.892 --> 37:54.060
‐ Hey, hey, I'm here with you,

37:54.061 --> 37:56.228
and this is where
I want to be, okay?

37:56.229 --> 37:57.521
Please come back to bed.

37:57.522 --> 37:57.590
‐ It is not okay.

37:57.591 --> 37:58.981
‐ It is not okay.

37:58.982 --> 38:00.733
It's never gonna be okay.

38:00.734 --> 38:03.027
Ah.

38:03.028 --> 38:04.070
I got it, okay.

38:04.071 --> 38:05.446
I just‐‐

38:05.447 --> 38:07.491
I got it.
It's...

38:30.680 --> 38:38.680
‐ For you.

38:42.526 --> 38:43.526
‐ Last night...

38:43.527 --> 38:46.737
‐ We all made mistakes.

38:46.738 --> 38:50.116
Myself included.

38:50.117 --> 38:52.326
I got us into
this financial mess,

38:52.327 --> 38:55.246
and when I had an opportunity
to help get us out,

38:55.247 --> 38:56.831
I, uh...

38:56.832 --> 38:57.590
I‐I handled it poorly.

38:57.591 --> 39:00.167
I‐I handled it poorly.

39:00.168 --> 39:01.836
But I've been

39:01.837 --> 39:03.754
thinking and making
alternate plans.

39:03.755 --> 39:05.548
There are people
we can reach out to

39:05.549 --> 39:08.426
to call on before
we let the counsel know.

39:08.427 --> 39:11.929
‐ I could turn you in,

39:11.930 --> 39:18.102
for Silas.

39:18.103 --> 39:22.022
‐ You could.

39:22.023 --> 39:23.983
You won't.

39:23.984 --> 39:25.234
Because then it's over.

39:25.235 --> 39:27.589
It's all over.

39:27.590 --> 39:31.699
It's all over.

39:31.700 --> 39:36.871
‐ How do you do it?

39:36.872 --> 39:40.708
How do you
live with yourself, Cal?

39:40.709 --> 39:43.961
I mean, the truth.

39:43.962 --> 39:47.673
And not what you preach.

39:47.674 --> 39:50.844
Because I'm having
a really hard time.

40:05.984 --> 40:12.072
‐ It's hell.

40:12.073 --> 40:14.950
Um...

40:14.951 --> 40:21.290
It's a living, waking hell.

40:21.291 --> 40:23.292
I'm never

40:23.293 --> 40:26.795
without regret,

40:26.796 --> 40:27.590
much as it goes against
everything we teach.

40:27.591 --> 40:29.632
Much as it goes against
everything we teach.

40:29.633 --> 40:35.638
Um...

40:35.639 --> 40:39.850
It's‐‐just always,
always with me.

40:39.851 --> 40:41.685
All I can do is‐‐

40:41.686 --> 40:43.813
is try to make up
for it, but I...

40:49.486 --> 40:50.819
That's why this place,

40:50.820 --> 40:55.784
I didn't want to let it go b‐‐

40:59.996 --> 41:03.541
Come here.

41:03.542 --> 41:07.671
I want to show you.

41:50.755 --> 41:54.925
Source of Light,

41:54.926 --> 41:57.589
we turn to you.

41:57.590 --> 41:58.221
We turn to you.

41:58.222 --> 42:02.851
Help us to purify our spirits.

42:35.342 --> 42:38.427
Forever bound to one another

42:38.428 --> 42:40.512
in Light,

42:40.513 --> 42:43.974
a circle of communion.

42:43.975 --> 42:46.644
Let the bonding of these hands

42:46.645 --> 42:48.312
be a symbol

42:48.313 --> 42:51.107
for the bond they have
to each other.

43:06.122 --> 43:09.250
Steer us from the darkness.

43:13.588 --> 43:17.050
Free us from earthly cares.

43:22.972 --> 43:26.017
Fill our hearts with love.

43:32.857 --> 43:35.318
And help us become...

43:41.950 --> 43:46.578
A perfect vessel of your Truth.

43:46.579 --> 43:49.708
So that we may
continue the climb.

43:52.335 --> 43:55.671
So it is witnessed.

43:55.672 --> 43:57.589
So it will be.

43:57.590 --> 43:58.590
So it will be.
