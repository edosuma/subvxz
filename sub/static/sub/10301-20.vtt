01:56.840 --> 01:59.035
Oh, not you again.

02:00.080 --> 02:03.436
Honey, now that you're up,
rub my tushy so I can go back to sleep.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.596
Oh, Peg.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.434
How come nobody
ever rubs my tushy?

02:08.680 --> 02:12.992
Well, I'll tell you what.
This weekend, you mow it, I'll rub it.

02:22.920 --> 02:25.639
Oh, Al, it just doesn't feel right.

02:25.840 --> 02:28.513
Well, maybe I'm rubbing
against the grain.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.791
Know what would
really help me go to sleep?

02:33.000 --> 02:37.710
Yes, Peg, but I don't think we can get
Dr. Kevorkian on such short notice.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.836
No, Al.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.395
Tell me a story.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.556
Oh, all right.

02:46.280 --> 02:50.239
Once upon a time
there was a princess named Peggy.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.039
I like this one.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.593
She had everything.

02:53.800 --> 02:57.429
Beauty, charm, breeding, inbreeding.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.839
A huge fat mother.
Everything a little girl could want.

03:01.840 --> 03:04.434
Then one day she married a prince.

03:04.640 --> 03:06.471
Bonny Prince Al.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.878
- Were they happy?
- Not at first.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.194
But then she brought over
four of her best girlfriends...

03:13.400 --> 03:16.392
...with the most luscious hooters
you ever saw.

03:19.240 --> 03:22.630
The princess went
into a deep, deep sleep...

03:22.880 --> 03:26.589
...and Al and the eight hooters
lived happily ever after.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.434
Don't you worry, guys.

03:33.640 --> 03:36.234
No matter what he says,
he still loves you.

03:36.440 --> 03:37.668
Tell them that you do, Al.

03:37.880 --> 03:41.077
They know I do, Peg.
It's you I have the problem with.

03:42.360 --> 03:44.237
Now I'm all tense.

03:44.440 --> 03:46.556
But I know what you could do
to make me drowsy.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.159
Oh, no.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.915
Not that, Al.
That only puts you to sleep.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.914
Could you go down and get me
a nice warm glass of milk?

03:57.480 --> 04:01.439
But hurry back, honey.
You know I can't sleep without you.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.469
It's always your tushy, your milk.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.150
Your stinking orgasm.

04:11.960 --> 04:15.555
What about me?
How come I don't get no tushy rub?

04:15.920 --> 04:18.115
If there is one
desirable tushy in this house...

04:18.320 --> 04:20.276
...it's the one right behind me.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.156
Hey, this is all right.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.670
Well, it's darn relaxing.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.713
How come I spend
so much time like this...

04:37.800 --> 04:42.237
...when this is
right around the corner?

04:44.680 --> 04:46.750
Hey, wait a second.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.195
I've got two hands.

04:57.360 --> 05:00.591
Oh, good night, folks.

05:08.560 --> 05:09.834
Hi, Daddy.

05:10.040 --> 05:12.554
You know, you're twice as talented
as Michael Jackson...

05:12.760 --> 05:14.990
...because he only uses one hand.

05:17.560 --> 05:20.233
Well, that's great.
Now I won't fall asleep again.

05:20.440 --> 05:23.113
Guess I'll try what I learned
from my dad when I was a kid.

05:23.320 --> 05:24.992
Counting hooters.

05:26.720 --> 05:30.110
Two, four, six...

05:31.160 --> 05:34.072
Eight. Oh, no, now,
wait a minute. It's twins.

05:35.480 --> 05:38.358
Twelve, fourteen...

05:48.760 --> 05:51.911
- Are you gonna come inside?
- No.

05:52.120 --> 05:55.749
Oh, I get it. You want me
right here, right now, on the floor.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.392
Hell no.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.075
Well, why'd you
walk me to my door, then?

06:01.280 --> 06:04.670
Because it was the only way
to get you out of my car.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.599
Dad, did you see that?

06:13.400 --> 06:14.799
No.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.271
Did you see this?

06:19.760 --> 06:21.193
- No.
- Good.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.391
- Well, good night, son.
- Good night.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.398
Hey, son. Son?

06:27.400 --> 06:29.277
Always remember...

06:29.480 --> 06:31.516
...you've got two hands.

06:35.280 --> 06:38.033
Thanks, Dad. I'll be needing them.

06:40.520 --> 06:42.033
Yeah, yeah, kids are great.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.390
They bring you so much pleasure.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.396
That's why a man
should always have a dog.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.555
Buck, boy,
bring me my slippers, boy.

06:53.360 --> 06:56.079
That's all right, boy.
You don't owe me anything.

06:56.280 --> 07:01.229
Just your worthless, stinking one-step-
from-being-gassed-in-the-pound life.

07:02.360 --> 07:04.396
All right, back to hooters.

07:04.640 --> 07:08.633
Thirty, thirty-two,
thirty-four, thirty-six...

08:01.720 --> 08:02.948
All right, Peg.

08:09.640 --> 08:14.509
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, hey now!

08:14.720 --> 08:16.472
Hey, you're not my wife.

08:16.680 --> 08:18.113
<i>What are you doing with my TV?</i>

08:18.360 --> 08:21.909
Nothing as bad as you
were doing with my butt.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.990
Now, don't look for trouble, mister.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.158
Just shut up and sit down.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.396
This stuff ain't worth
losing your life over.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.948
Hey, this is my house.

08:33.159 --> 08:35.515
I don't let the bank in here
and they own the place.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.433
Don't you take another step.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.517
Sic him, boy.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.434
Why don't you try
to be as smart as your dog, buddy.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.877
I've tried.

08:51.480 --> 08:52.913
It doesn't work.

09:02.880 --> 09:08.716
<i>And this is a really remarkable story
about a totally unremarkable man.</i>

09:09.200 --> 09:14.069
<i>A ruthless intruder brok e into his
shabby home in search of loot...</i>

09:14.280 --> 09:18.432
<i>...but instead found
one brave shoe salesman...</i>

09:18.640 --> 09:22.679
<i>...who, for all of us,
finally said, "No more. "</i>

09:22.880 --> 09:27.635
<i>And that man is
Al "the Defender" Bundy.</i>

09:35.520 --> 09:38.353
Hey, Mom, you think Dad
can make money off this whole thing?

09:38.560 --> 09:40.915
Honey, you heard
what your father said to the press.

09:41.120 --> 09:43.031
This was an act of pure heroism.

09:43.240 --> 09:46.073
Not to be cheapened
by crass commercialism.

09:46.280 --> 09:50.159
And you know your father's word
is as good as his breath.

10:01.080 --> 10:02.718
Yes, yes, yes.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.315
I am an American hero.

10:05.520 --> 10:07.670
And in the grand tradition
of American heroes...

10:07.880 --> 10:10.872
...I will hawk more products
than Bill Cosby.

10:12.640 --> 10:14.312
When he was hot.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.834
That could be
the Jell-O pudding people.

10:21.040 --> 10:24.112
Oh, wait. What if it's a burglar?

10:34.400 --> 10:37.039
<i>Then I'll answer it with this:</i>

10:37.280 --> 10:39.555
Wait a second.
Burglars don't ring doorbells.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.432
What if it's somebody for charity?

10:44.840 --> 10:46.751
Answer it with this.

10:49.360 --> 10:53.114
Hey, Al. I saw you on television.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.235
But how can I put this delicately?

11:00.440 --> 11:03.398
You were as dull as women's golf.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.311
Well, but- Look...

11:06.520 --> 11:09.353
...I know that you're looking
for endorsements, you know.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.312
But, I mean, let's face the facts.

11:11.520 --> 11:14.592
You're limited by your
coarse and common look. So...

11:14.840 --> 11:18.549
...we tell the advertisers
that I'm Al Bundy.

11:18.760 --> 11:21.194
What company wouldn't
want me as their spokesman?

11:21.400 --> 11:23.630
I've got it all. I'm the total package.

11:23.840 --> 11:27.116
I'm non-threatening, superficial...

11:27.680 --> 11:30.240
I am the '90s, babe.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.830
Look, I even fit better
with your family.

11:37.760 --> 11:40.832
You see how I can make
anything look better?

11:41.040 --> 11:43.235
Oh, Al. Take a picture.

11:43.440 --> 11:46.238
Mom will be so happy.

11:51.200 --> 11:55.796
Oh, hello, officer. Did you mistake
our house for a doughnut shop?

12:02.840 --> 12:04.193
Obviously not.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.879
There's only one of me.

12:06.080 --> 12:07.957
You cops.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.992
Mr. Bundy, the guys
down at the station think you're great.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.317
In fact, we've ripped up
all your parking tickets.

12:16.720 --> 12:22.033
And we're covering up that little
incident down at the nudie bar.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.359
But we got some bad news for you.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.632
That burglar got out on bail
and he says he's coming to get you.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.110
Ah, let him come.
I'm not afraid of him.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.675
I took him when he had a crowbar,
I'll take him now.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.110
What kind of weapon
has he got this time, a gun?

12:46.760 --> 12:48.637
More deadly.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.432
A lawyer.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.473
He says you attacked him.

12:52.680 --> 12:55.592
He's suing you for $50,000.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.838
Peg?

13:04.040 --> 13:06.918
Peg, I'm ready for court.

13:07.240 --> 13:09.071
- Where are the kids?
- They're upstairs.

13:09.280 --> 13:11.316
Honey, they have a surprise for you.

13:11.520 --> 13:14.318
Kids! Come down and show Daddy!

13:23.880 --> 13:26.519
Kids, you don't know
what this means to me.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.314
You never said that in public before.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.715
What do these things say, anyway?

13:34.320 --> 13:35.594
What difference does it make?

13:35.800 --> 13:38.951
The important thing is
it's gonna get us cars.

13:39.720 --> 13:42.393
Well, now, kids, that won't come
until after the trial.

13:42.600 --> 13:43.828
But don't worry about it.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.439
You know your dad's a winner.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.108
I'm warning you, Dad.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.675
Ever wanna see these shirts again,
get a good lawyer.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.474
What for? It's cut and dry.

13:58.680 --> 14:01.877
Guy broke into my house.
I broke into his face.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.958
Simple. So simple
a moron could defend me.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.072
Your Honour, I am here
to defend my daddy.

14:21.080 --> 14:24.675
D is for " Daddy. "

14:25.920 --> 14:28.036
A is for " Daddy. "

14:29.200 --> 14:32.749
D is for " Daddy. "

14:33.920 --> 14:35.148
Y is for " Daddy. "

14:35.360 --> 14:37.430
I is for Daddy. We is for Daddy.

14:37.640 --> 14:39.119
The defence breasts.

14:44.400 --> 14:47.073
Your Honour, if there
actually is a valid lawsuit here...

14:47.280 --> 14:49.555
<i>...it should be
Bundy v. The Board of Education...</i>

14:49.760 --> 14:52.274
...because she actually
graduated high school.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.999
Now, if you don't mind,
I will now fire my daughter...

14:57.200 --> 15:00.112
<i>...and put my money
on another idiot: Me.</i>

15:00.320 --> 15:02.709
Objection stained.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.188
Order in the court.

15:06.440 --> 15:08.237
I'll have a cheeseburger.

15:11.120 --> 15:14.078
I'm on trial, yet she walks free.

15:14.400 --> 15:18.313
Your Honour, I motion that this case
be thrown out of court...

15:18.520 --> 15:20.715
...so I can get money
for my endorsement deals...

15:20.920 --> 15:23.480
...and give you whatever you think
is your fair share.

15:23.920 --> 15:27.833
Mr. Bundy, I have a date
with a prostitute.

15:29.040 --> 15:32.749
But there are certain procedures
that we must follow.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.397
<i>The case of
Richard Johnson v. Al Bundy.</i>

15:36.600 --> 15:38.989
Mr. Johnson's attorney,
please proceed.

15:39.560 --> 15:41.073
Thank you, Your Honour.

15:41.280 --> 15:44.590
Look at my poor client's
innocent face.

15:47.400 --> 15:51.234
An obviously sweet man
who was attacked by this animal.

15:51.480 --> 15:54.836
<i>Verily, I feared for my life.</i>

15:55.120 --> 15:57.111
Your Honour, if you're
not touched by that...

15:57.320 --> 16:00.039
...you're not the man
I slept with in law school.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.438
Gee, Al, it's really going great.

16:09.120 --> 16:12.829
Your Honour, I'd like you to take a look
at exhibits A, B and C.

16:13.040 --> 16:17.795
The valuables that my client
allegedly stole from Mr. Bundy.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.309
A plastic clown.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.829
A vase in very poor taste.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.838
<i>And a copy of Big 'Uns.</i>

16:29.480 --> 16:32.313
<i>Your Honour, that was
the Christmas issue of Big 'Uns...</i>

16:32.520 --> 16:36.035
...and they were all
decorated for the holidays.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.150
He decorated them himself,
Your Honour.

16:40.160 --> 16:43.596
Your Honour, the issue here
is not how sick I am.

16:43.840 --> 16:46.593
The issue is that this man
broke into my house.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.876
Your Honour, how do we know
that my client...

16:49.080 --> 16:51.036
...broke into Mr. Bundy's house?

16:51.240 --> 16:52.468
Mr. Johnson...

16:52.680 --> 16:56.468
...did Mr. Bundy give any indication
that he did not want you in his home?

16:56.720 --> 16:58.278
Quite to the contrary.

16:58.480 --> 17:02.553
He fondled by bottom
with his bare hands.

17:03.920 --> 17:05.830
Is this true, Mr. Bundy?

17:08.400 --> 17:11.675
Well, yes. Yes, I did. But...

17:16.319 --> 17:20.233
- I thought it was my wife.
- You should be so lucky.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.829
My wife's heinie puts yours to shame.
And so does mine, I might add.

17:25.040 --> 17:28.077
That's not the story
your hand told me.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.756
So this is what you do
while I'm asleep.

17:32.760 --> 17:36.833
Al, I want you to answer me this
and answer me right now.

17:37.040 --> 17:40.077
Did this man get my warm milk too?

17:40.360 --> 17:43.989
Peg, I swear I didn't feed him.
I only felt him.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.355
Are you gonna see him again?

17:49.040 --> 17:52.635
Your Honour, these people
obviously deserve their fate.

17:52.840 --> 17:54.831
But my client does not.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.998
So he had a few items
that didn't belong to him.

17:58.200 --> 18:01.192
Perhaps he's a congressman.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.798
Or perhaps they were love gifts...

18:04.000 --> 18:07.037
...from the man who used him
and then threw him out.

18:08.640 --> 18:11.393
I just know he got my milk.

18:11.640 --> 18:15.474
What we're looking at here,
Your Honour, is an animal.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.955
Not like the gentle creatures
we know and love...

18:18.160 --> 18:21.948
<i>...from Born Free or the timeless
Lady and the Tramp...</i>

18:22.200 --> 18:25.351
...but rather, a ferocious beast,
totally out of control.

18:25.560 --> 18:28.154
Mr. Bundy, what if a Girl Scout
came by selling cookies?

18:28.360 --> 18:30.078
Would you have
kicked her in the face?

18:30.520 --> 18:32.590
I would, and have.

18:37.160 --> 18:41.153
We're asking for $50,000
in compensation, Your Honour.

18:41.360 --> 18:44.193
Not just for the medical costs
incurred by my client...

18:44.400 --> 18:48.473
...but for the mental stress
that my client is going through.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.875
Let's hear it in his own words.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.553
" My life is in a... "

18:54.760 --> 18:56.591
- Shambles.
- "Shambles. "

18:56.800 --> 18:59.473
" I am now afraid
to break into people's homes.

19:00.720 --> 19:03.678
My career as a burglar
may well have been cut short...

19:03.880 --> 19:06.758
...while still in the prime of my life.

19:07.640 --> 19:12.953
I can no longer look at my own behind
with child-like innocence.

19:14.120 --> 19:18.796
But 50,000 bucks will help a lot. "

19:19.800 --> 19:21.711
We rest our case.

19:22.640 --> 19:24.915
Mr. Bundy, your statement, please.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.718
Your Honour...

19:27.920 --> 19:30.309
...even a man of obvious
limited intelligence...

19:30.520 --> 19:32.875
...as yourself can judge this case.

19:33.800 --> 19:38.032
I have been in court
on a thousand trumped-up charges.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.708
Some real, some imagined.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.197
The point is, I lost all of them.

19:44.520 --> 19:45.748
I don't know the law...

19:45.960 --> 19:48.269
...nor do I really know
how to pleasure a woman.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.910
I have no interest in either.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.831
<i>But let me ask you
one important question:</i>

19:55.880 --> 19:59.634
How did we become a great country?

20:00.080 --> 20:04.437
By kicking the heinies of anybody
who threatened our borders.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.117
And that's what I was doing.

20:10.320 --> 20:13.039
I was protecting my border.

20:13.240 --> 20:14.514
A man comes into my house...

20:15.400 --> 20:18.995
...he better be carrying
a summons or a pizza.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.478
But this man wasn't...

20:22.680 --> 20:24.989
...so I called in the Marines...

20:25.200 --> 20:27.839
...and the 51 st Airborne.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.195
So in conclusion, Your Honour...

20:34.040 --> 20:36.110
...if you rule against me...

20:36.320 --> 20:39.949
...you rule against every man
who fought for his country.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.910
The boys at San Juan Hill
and the boys at Iwo Jima.

20:44.120 --> 20:48.079
Audie Murphy, Eddie Murphy,
Murphy Brown...

20:48.400 --> 20:51.119
...brown-and-serve sausage...

20:51.320 --> 20:55.199
...the cheap brown shoes that
every working man is proud to use...

20:55.400 --> 20:59.473
...to kick the heinie of any man
who invades his home.

21:07.520 --> 21:11.274
Your Honour, I await your decision.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.273
Guilty.

21:13.520 --> 21:15.988
Of course, of course.

21:16.240 --> 21:20.153
The court rules you should
pay $50,000 to this man.

21:22.480 --> 21:25.119
I'm going to Disneyland.

21:26.080 --> 21:30.039
So for hitting this guy I get
charged $50,000 which I don't have?

21:30.240 --> 21:33.038
Well, hell, I may as well
go for a hundred.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.992
Oh, Al, you did it.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.553
I'm so proud of you.

21:50.760 --> 21:52.876
The system finally
came through for us.

21:53.080 --> 21:56.914
Yeah, I sued him
for hurting my hand on his face.

21:58.920 --> 22:00.956
Claimed I can't sell shoes.

22:01.160 --> 22:03.594
As if you ever could.

22:07.480 --> 22:09.630
But I can still do this.

22:14.080 --> 22:16.833
As if you ever could.

22:53.160 --> 22:56.357
Where is my damn cheeseburger?

22:57.305 --> 23:03.534
