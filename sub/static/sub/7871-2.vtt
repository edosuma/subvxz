(screeches, whistles)

00:06.761 --> 00:09.796
(shouting gibberish)

00:12.173 --> 00:14.274
According to our Mayan calendar,

00:14.308 --> 00:16.443
the world will be destroyed

00:16.477 --> 00:19.045
at the end of
the 13th <i>baktun.</i>

00:19.080 --> 00:22.882
Unless we appease the gods'
anger with a human sacrifice.

00:22.917 --> 00:25.919
Don't worry. We got a guy here
we really been fattening up.

00:25.953 --> 00:27.220
Is it you?

00:27.254 --> 00:29.055
Not me. That guy.

00:29.090 --> 00:30.724
More cricket fajitas!

00:30.758 --> 00:33.059
Oh, my brave,
brave glutton.

00:33.094 --> 00:36.830
I'll be so lonely when they
sacrifice you to the gods.

00:36.864 --> 00:39.199
(loud spit)
What?!

00:39.233 --> 00:41.151
No one said anything
about a sacrifice!

00:41.185 --> 00:44.504
Although I... I did kind of
space out during orientation.

00:44.538 --> 00:46.222
All right already,
let's get this done

00:46.257 --> 00:48.858
while our doomed civilization
is still flourishing here.

00:48.893 --> 00:50.860
Oh. Any words of comfort?

00:50.895 --> 00:53.063
Oh, yeah, sure. Even though
you know it's coming,

00:53.097 --> 00:54.731
when you see
your own beating heart,

00:54.765 --> 00:56.166
try to act surprised, huh?

00:56.200 --> 00:57.700
It's some kid's first time.

00:57.735 --> 01:00.136
Fear not, my beloved
blood offering.

01:00.171 --> 01:02.055
(quietly):
I have a plan.

01:02.089 --> 01:03.823
Tell me, High Priest,

01:03.858 --> 01:06.326
are you interested in women?

01:06.360 --> 01:07.660
What priest isn't?

01:07.695 --> 01:09.062
Before we make love,

01:09.096 --> 01:11.498
would you mind putting
a sack over your head?

01:11.532 --> 01:14.167
Is there any other way?
(chuckles)

01:14.201 --> 01:15.318
Nice and tight.

01:15.352 --> 01:17.520
Now enter the Room of Pleasure,
Ooh.

01:17.571 --> 01:19.572
and I shall join you shortly.

01:21.208 --> 01:24.110
Now, uh, I got to warn you.
I'm into rough stuff.

01:24.145 --> 01:26.613
Ooh, that's a good start,
but, you know, make it hurt.

01:26.647 --> 01:28.114
(sword whooshes)
Heh. Ooh!

01:28.149 --> 01:31.201
That whooshing sound
is <i>really</i> turning me...

01:31.969 --> 01:33.353
Oh!

01:33.387 --> 01:35.221
Uh. Oh, yeah. Ah.

01:35.256 --> 01:37.290
(grunting)

01:37.324 --> 01:39.225
(groans)

01:39.260 --> 01:41.177
(kids laughing)

01:41.212 --> 01:43.630
Man, soccer's even boring
for the ball.

01:43.664 --> 01:44.964
Quetzal H. Coatl!

01:44.999 --> 01:46.800
We sacrificed the wrong person!

01:46.834 --> 01:50.370
Now the earth <i>will</i> be destroyed
after the 13th <i>baktun.</i>

01:50.404 --> 01:53.306
(shouting): Can you explain
that in simple Ancient Mayan?!

01:53.340 --> 01:55.475
Of course. There's no
need to shout and scream.

01:55.509 --> 01:56.709
Let's see, uh,

01:56.744 --> 01:58.378
converting to base 10,

01:58.412 --> 02:01.147
assuming for the birth of Jesus,

02:01.182 --> 02:04.184
invent and then
carry the leap year,

02:04.218 --> 02:07.887
and the world will end in 2012!

02:07.922 --> 02:08.988
(relieved sighs)

02:09.023 --> 02:11.457
And it will be
Obama's fault!

02:12.459 --> 02:15.428
(dramatic theme plays)

02:17.198 --> 02:19.065
Hey, uh, Marge,
I'm setting my watch.

02:19.099 --> 02:20.333
What <i>baktun</i> is it?

02:20.367 --> 02:22.101
13th!
Oh!

02:22.136 --> 02:23.770
(doorbell rings)

QUIMBY: Welcome to the grand
opening of our whatchamacallit,

03:22.121 --> 03:24.756
which, thanks to the lobbying
of Lisa Simpson,

03:24.790 --> 03:27.358
we built instead
of a new baseball stadium.

03:27.392 --> 03:29.310
At least the pennant
works both ways.

03:29.344 --> 03:33.080
Professor Frink will now throw
a switch, which will either

03:33.098 --> 03:36.634
answer certain obscure
questions of subatomic physics

03:36.668 --> 03:39.287
or destroy the universe.

Oh, my God particle!

03:49.331 --> 03:50.832
What is it, Professor?

03:50.866 --> 03:53.468
You can tell your
grandchildren you were here

03:53.502 --> 03:56.571
when humanity finally learned
that this accelerator

03:56.605 --> 03:59.140
is much too small to tell
us anything important.

03:59.174 --> 04:00.441
(crowd groans)

04:00.476 --> 04:02.243
Thanks a lot, Liser!

04:02.277 --> 04:05.046

Lisa, do you

05:10.362 --> 05:12.396
have a stray dog down there?

05:12.431 --> 05:15.333
Um, it's a lot worse
than a stray dog.

05:15.367 --> 05:16.734
<i>Two</i> stray dogs?!

05:16.768 --> 05:17.869
It's a black hole!

05:17.903 --> 05:19.503
That was gonna be
my next guess.

05:19.538 --> 05:21.322
Are you sure
your next guess wasn't

05:21.356 --> 05:22.990
<i>three</i> stray dogs?

05:23.025 --> 05:24.242
Maybe.

05:24.910 --> 05:26.827
HOMER:
A black hole?!

05:26.862 --> 05:29.030
(hushed): I'm sorry,
can we call it that?

05:29.064 --> 05:31.182
Yes. It's
the preferred term.

05:31.216 --> 05:33.584
And most scientists believe
that what enters a black hole

05:33.619 --> 05:35.186
never comes out.

05:35.220 --> 05:38.322
But some think they may be
a gateway to other universes.

05:38.357 --> 05:40.508
Hey! Could it open
a pretzel bag for me?

05:40.542 --> 05:42.009
Help a brother out, B.H.

05:42.043 --> 05:43.444
Whoo-hoo!

05:43.478 --> 05:44.712
D'oh!

05:47.716 --> 05:50.551
Guys! Stop throwing
things in the hole!

05:50.586 --> 05:52.052
The more you throw in,
the bigger

05:52.070 --> 05:54.055
and more dangerous it becomes!

05:54.089 --> 05:57.425
Come on. You can't look at that
infinitely dense little guy

05:57.459 --> 05:59.410
and not want
to feed it <i>something.</i>

05:59.444 --> 06:00.711
Dad, don't pat it!

06:00.746 --> 06:02.246

06:08.954 --> 06:10.705

Okay, that's it!

06:10.739 --> 06:13.307
I'm putting a baby gate
across the black hole.

06:13.342 --> 06:16.294
And don't throw
anything more into it!

06:16.328 --> 06:18.412
(groans)
Yes, Homer?

06:18.430 --> 06:20.097

10:54.024 --> 10:56.625
HOMER: I'm right behind you,
honey! We have stairs?

10:56.660 --> 10:58.394
(thumping)
Ow! D'oh! Aah! D'oh!

10:58.445 --> 10:59.778
(continues grunting, thumping)

10:59.813 --> 11:01.563
What the...?
Ow! Ooh! Ow! Ooh!

11:01.614 --> 11:03.732
(continues grunting, thumping)

11:05.785 --> 11:07.186
(flames crackling)

11:07.220 --> 11:08.821
HOMER:
What the...?

11:08.855 --> 11:11.490
(gasping breaths)

11:11.524 --> 11:13.726
Why is this happening to us?!

11:13.760 --> 11:16.729
I don't know, I don't know!
I'm sure I don't know!

11:16.763 --> 11:18.364
HOMER:
Oh, sweetie.

11:18.398 --> 11:21.233
Sometimes a mysterious,
invisible being from Hell

11:21.267 --> 11:24.036
waits for a family to go
to sleep then kills them.

11:24.070 --> 11:25.404
Now, go to bed.
But...

11:25.438 --> 11:27.089
Uh-uh. School night.

11:27.123 --> 11:30.225
Now, you're sure
I bought enough cameras

11:30.260 --> 11:32.177
and extended warranties
to catch that ghost?

11:32.211 --> 11:33.712
Sir, whatever happens
in this house,

11:33.730 --> 11:35.347
these cameras
will pick it up.

11:35.382 --> 11:37.132
Ooh, I can't wait
for tonight's massacre.

11:49.879 --> 11:52.281
(tape fast-forwarding)

11:55.151 --> 11:57.720
Hey, Marge.
(low grunt): Mmm...

11:57.754 --> 11:59.855
Oh. Like
what you see, huh?

11:59.889 --> 12:01.457
(low grunt):
Mmm...

12:01.491 --> 12:03.692
I like it when
you don't say words.

12:03.727 --> 12:05.561
Come here, you.
Mmm...

12:05.595 --> 12:08.364
(chuckles)
Mmm...

12:08.398 --> 12:11.300
(singing a melody)

12:11.351 --> 12:12.634
(tape fast-forwarding)

12:12.669 --> 12:16.271
(continues singing melody)

12:22.946 --> 12:24.897
(tape fast-forwarding)

12:24.931 --> 12:27.299
(continues singing melody)

12:29.803 --> 12:31.136
Eh, eh.

12:31.171 --> 12:33.255
Yeah, that's hellfire,
all right.

12:33.289 --> 12:35.908
Someone in this family
has made a deal with the devil,

12:35.942 --> 12:38.010
and now the devil
wants his due.

12:38.044 --> 12:40.479
Now, remember, this creature
feeds on your fear...

12:40.513 --> 12:42.798
(cuckoo clock chimes)
What the hell was that?!

12:42.832 --> 12:44.750
(sobbing loudly)

12:44.784 --> 12:47.953
Actually, he feeds on
more than just fear.

12:50.957 --> 12:52.624
(door creaks)

12:52.659 --> 12:54.660
(wind whistling)

13:02.569 --> 13:04.470
Give back my baby!

13:04.504 --> 13:06.004
DEMON:
We had a deal!

13:06.039 --> 13:07.940
Mom, what's
going on?!

13:07.974 --> 13:09.842
DEMON: Don't act so
surprised, Marge.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.543
You knew this
day was coming!

13:11.578 --> 13:13.195
Let's see what
we're dealing with here.

13:13.229 --> 13:14.430
(grunts)

13:14.464 --> 13:16.165
It's Moe with wings!

13:16.199 --> 13:17.983
Moe Szyslak?

13:18.001 --> 13:20.702
Come on, he's much more
hideous and evil than <i>me!</i>

13:20.737 --> 13:22.037
(all agreeing)

13:22.088 --> 13:25.340
(crying):
I brought this on us all.

13:25.375 --> 13:27.876
It began when
I was a girl...

13:31.498 --> 13:33.699
(deep grunting)

13:33.733 --> 13:35.300
(in unison):
Hail Satan.

13:35.335 --> 13:37.736
What are you doing?
Trying to summon the devil.

13:37.770 --> 13:39.538
Why?
Nothing good on TV.

13:39.572 --> 13:40.906
We have no boyfriends.

13:40.940 --> 13:42.808
We're bored.
Something to do.

13:42.842 --> 13:45.978
Hail Satan,
the Minister of Sinister,

13:46.012 --> 13:48.497
Rude Dude with a Bad 'Tude.

13:49.999 --> 13:51.967
(Selma and Patty grunting,
choking)

13:52.001 --> 13:53.936
(gasps)
Save us, Marge.

13:53.970 --> 13:56.371
We'll never make fun
of any man you date or marry.

13:56.406 --> 13:58.440
Mmm. Uh, Mr. Demon?
Mmm?

13:58.475 --> 14:01.026
Could you... come back
for my sisters later?

14:01.060 --> 14:02.377
(Selma and Patty grunting)

14:02.412 --> 14:04.713
Very well.
You have 30 years.

14:04.747 --> 14:06.248
But when I return, Marge,

14:06.282 --> 14:09.084
I shall take
your favorite child.

14:09.118 --> 14:12.087
I thought I was
the favorite!

14:12.121 --> 14:14.389
Not the favorite!
Not the favorite!

14:14.424 --> 14:16.788
Listen, pal, you seem
like an honest guy.

14:16.813 --> 14:17.593
Mm.

14:17.594 --> 14:21.063
Is there any other deal
that you can accept?

14:21.097 --> 14:22.664
Three-way.

14:22.699 --> 14:24.600
Hmm. You,
me and Marge?

14:24.634 --> 14:26.668
Mmm, demon,
demon, you.

14:26.703 --> 14:30.772
(heavy sigh) I guess it's one of those
things a dad has to do.

14:30.807 --> 14:32.941
Now, before we start,
what's the safe word?

14:32.976 --> 14:34.243
Cinnamon.

14:34.277 --> 14:35.711
Ooh, I like that.

14:35.745 --> 14:38.413
Now, I'd like to try something
new, if you don't mind.

14:38.448 --> 14:41.016
(laughs) Cinnamon. Cinnamon.
Cinnamon! Cinnamon!

14:48.444 --> 14:49.945
You know, it's
really not fair.

14:49.979 --> 14:51.747
You're charging 200
bucks for a comic

14:51.781 --> 14:53.615
that says 25 cents
on the cover.

14:53.650 --> 14:56.251
The only way to buy that
comic book for 25 cents

14:56.286 --> 14:58.170
is to go back to 1974.

14:58.204 --> 14:59.805
That's impossible!

14:59.839 --> 15:01.006
Mmm?

15:01.040 --> 15:03.108
(quietly):
Or <i>is</i> it?

15:07.113 --> 15:08.981
(zapping)

15:10.800 --> 15:12.317
Wow, it worked!

15:12.352 --> 15:13.919
My time machine has worked!

15:13.953 --> 15:17.122
This is the most fantastically
powerful invention

15:17.156 --> 15:19.424
in mankind's history!

15:19.459 --> 15:20.626
Here, kid, hold my keys

15:20.660 --> 15:22.160
while I grab
some lunch.

I won't be needing this!

15:48.738 --> 15:50.255
(zapping)

15:55.428 --> 15:57.579
Now to get my comic book
and explore a world

15:57.614 --> 15:59.565

at George Lucas.

15:59.599 --> 16:01.700

16:01.734 --> 16:04.219
Eh, pretty good.
A little preachy.

Hmm?

Allow me, gentlemen.

16:20.637 --> 16:22.204
Hey, Homer.

I'm your unwanted son

16:24.140 --> 16:25.707

16:25.742 --> 16:28.243
Why, you little...
(grunting)

16:28.278 --> 16:31.380
Excuse me.
Is this room 106?

16:37.120 --> 16:38.687
Let go of him!

16:38.721 --> 16:40.689
What kind of jerk
strangles a little boy?!

16:40.723 --> 16:42.691
Would you go to
the prom with me?

16:42.725 --> 16:44.760
Promenade? With <i>you?</i>

16:44.794 --> 16:46.995
Forget it, bub!
(grunts)

16:48.731 --> 16:51.300
It was love at first sight,
and you ruined it!

16:51.334 --> 16:53.368
It was <i>not</i> love
at first sight!

16:53.403 --> 16:54.770
What do you know?

16:54.804 --> 16:56.288
I know who I'm in love with!

16:56.322 --> 16:58.056
You're looking at him.
You're an idiot.

16:58.091 --> 16:59.908
You're the idiot!
(gasps)

16:59.942 --> 17:02.577
Don't act like I'm the first
person that ever said that.

17:02.612 --> 17:05.079
You <i>are</i> the first person
who ever said that!

17:05.114 --> 17:06.915
Shut up and go
to the prom with me!

17:06.949 --> 17:08.800
<i>Ay, caramba!</i> If you guys
don't get together,

17:08.835 --> 17:11.737
what does that mean for me
in the future?

17:11.771 --> 17:15.557
(gasps)
I don't exist?!

17:15.590 --> 17:17.224
<i>Or</i> my life

17:17.260 --> 17:20.061
might be a hell of a lot better!

17:20.096 --> 17:23.065
Ma'am, whatever you do,
do not marry that ape.

17:23.098 --> 17:25.901
Mmm.

17:25.935 --> 17:29.054
Whatever you say,
little boy.

17:29.088 --> 17:30.222
(laughing)
(growling)

17:30.256 --> 17:31.406
Come here!

17:32.942 --> 17:35.310
Now, to return to a future
where I'm either rich

17:35.345 --> 17:37.679
or allowed to stand in front
of a rich guy's house.

17:37.714 --> 17:39.681
Either way, better than now.

17:39.699 --> 17:42.317

Well, I'm going to...

17:51.678 --> 17:54.046

Ice cream with cookie dough?!

17:55.331 --> 17:57.833
Unnecessarily big TVs!

17:57.867 --> 18:00.268
Thursday <i>Night Football?</i>

18:00.303 --> 18:02.938
And the globe feels so warm!

18:02.972 --> 18:05.607
I am in awe of the future.

18:05.641 --> 18:09.177
(Wiggum snoring, muttering)

18:09.212 --> 18:11.213
Okay, that's not so great.

18:14.701 --> 18:16.518
Here's your smoothie,
sweetheart.

18:16.552 --> 18:20.439
Why would I suck smoothie
when I can suck face with you,

18:20.473 --> 18:22.441
Mrs. Artie Ziff?

18:22.475 --> 18:25.961
(both moaning)

18:25.995 --> 18:27.979
My dad is Artie Ziff?

18:28.014 --> 18:30.449
Indeed! Which makes <i>you</i>

18:30.483 --> 18:31.850
Barty Ziff.

18:33.820 --> 18:35.787
<i>Oy, caramba!</i>

18:35.822 --> 18:37.723
Achem!

18:37.757 --> 18:39.691
Good morning,
beloved son.

18:39.726 --> 18:41.543
Enjoy your
luxurious life,

18:41.577 --> 18:44.079
including your own
bully butler.

18:44.113 --> 18:46.715
Will that be
haw-haw, sir?

18:46.749 --> 18:47.966
Give yourself a wedgie.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.002
Excellent choice.
(grunts)

18:51.037 --> 18:53.505
I've met some jive turkeys
in the '70s,

18:53.539 --> 18:55.140
but that turkey's the jivest.

18:55.174 --> 18:57.242
Hey, you! This is
<i>my</i> peeping tree.

18:57.276 --> 18:59.811
Young me? What brings
you to the present?

18:59.846 --> 19:02.581
I traveled through space and
time to make Marge settle for me

19:02.615 --> 19:04.015
because she doesn't know better.

19:04.050 --> 19:06.218
Well, if we put
our heads together,

19:06.252 --> 19:07.853
we could think
of a plan!

19:09.222 --> 19:11.823
I got to ask,
what happened?

19:11.858 --> 19:14.359
Was I in a forest
fire or something?

19:14.393 --> 19:16.695
No

19:16.729 --> 19:17.863
(whip cracking)

19:17.897 --> 19:19.047
I love my life,
I love it not.

19:19.081 --> 19:20.348
I love my life, I love it not.

19:20.383 --> 19:22.584
You're just like
Indiana Jones, son.

19:22.618 --> 19:25.420

Dreyfuss in <i>our</i> universe.

19:25.455 --> 19:26.888

19:28.090 --> 19:29.858
I'm here to take
my life back!

19:29.892 --> 19:32.093
I thought this
might happen,

19:32.128 --> 19:35.964
so I mastered
Brazilian jujitsu.

19:35.998 --> 19:38.517
Crawl atop me,
and meet your doom!

19:38.568 --> 19:40.252
Not so fast.

19:40.286 --> 19:42.087
Say hello
to the United Federation

19:42.121 --> 19:45.457

19:47.443 --> 19:49.194

Crush them...

19:49.228 --> 19:51.463
in the name of Jebus!

19:57.920 --> 19:59.421
Okay, guys,
let's regroup.

19:59.455 --> 20:00.789
We'll come back with more Homers

20:00.823 --> 20:02.157
and start fresh in the morning.

Oh, what's <i>she</i> doing here?

20:14.320 --> 20:15.754
I'll tell you
what I'm doing.

20:15.788 --> 20:19.224
I'm realizing that
I married the wrong man.

20:19.537 --> 20:23.657
Oh, you poor, sweet,
simple Homers.

20:23.691 --> 20:26.493
I was supposed to be
with all of you!

20:26.528 --> 20:29.329
(grunting gibberish)

20:29.364 --> 20:31.331
Even you, Caveman Homer.

20:31.366 --> 20:32.566
That's Renaissance Homer.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.434
Well, cardinal
or cannibal,

20:34.469 --> 20:38.272
I wish that 20 years ago,
I had chosen love.

20:38.306 --> 20:39.673
Mmm...

20:41.442 --> 20:42.826
Let me get
this straight.

20:42.861 --> 20:45.896
None of you had time
to take out the garbage?

20:45.930 --> 20:47.915
Make Egyptian Slave
Homer do it.
