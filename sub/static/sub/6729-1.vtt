[Jessica] <i>New York may be</i>
<i>the city that never sleeps,</i>

01:25.291 --> 01:27.585
<i>but it sure does sleep around.</i>

01:27.668 --> 01:28.878
[camera clicking]

01:29.795 --> 01:31.255
<i>Not that I'm complaining.</i>

01:32.506 --> 01:34.800
<i>- Cheaters are good for business.</i>
- [woman moaning]

01:39.347 --> 01:43.351
<i>A big part of the job
is looking for the worst in people.</i>

01:44.936 --> 01:46.187
[woman continues moaning]

01:48.314 --> 01:50.524
<i>Turns out I excel at that.</i>

01:52.318 --> 01:54.904
<i>Clients hire me to find dirt.</i>

01:56.072 --> 01:57.490
<i>And I find it,</i>

01:57.573 --> 02:01.035
<i>which shouldn't surprise them,
but it does.</i>

02:01.119 --> 02:02.203
[both grunting]

02:02.286 --> 02:04.747
[man] That bitch!
She's sleeping with my brother?

02:04.831 --> 02:06.749
[Jessica] <i>Knowing it's real</i>
<i>means they gotta make a decision.</i>

02:06.833 --> 02:08.334
[Jessica] Calm down.

02:08.417 --> 02:09.961
[Jessica] <i>One, do something about it.</i>

02:10.044 --> 02:11.379
[man] She wants to go behind my back...

02:11.462 --> 02:14.257
[Jessica] <i>Or two, keep denying it.</i>

02:14.340 --> 02:15.549
<i>Shoot the messenger.</i>

02:15.633 --> 02:17.426
[man] She destroyed my life.

02:17.510 --> 02:20.554
[Jessica] <i>Tell me I'm getting off</i>
<i>on ruining their already shitty lives.</i>

02:20.638 --> 02:21.890
[man arguing indistinctly]

02:21.973 --> 02:24.308
<i>Option two rarely pans out.</i>

02:24.392 --> 02:25.894
[man grunting]

02:33.567 --> 02:36.237
And then there's the matter of your bill.

02:50.751 --> 02:52.921
<i>People do bad shit.</i>

02:53.004 --> 02:56.840
<i>I just avoid getting involved with them
in the first place.</i>

02:56.925 --> 02:58.301
<i>That works for me.</i>

03:00.678 --> 03:02.388
{an8}<i>Most of the time.</i>

03:15.734 --> 03:17.278
I can let you know as soon as...

03:18.737 --> 03:21.449
Jessica, did Miss Hogarth
ask you to stop by?

03:21.532 --> 03:22.783
Yep.

03:22.866 --> 03:24.118
- You're lying, aren't you?
- Yep.

03:24.202 --> 03:25.286
Got anything for me?

03:25.954 --> 03:27.621
I thought you didn't like or trust me.

03:27.705 --> 03:29.332
Oh, come on,
I meant lawyers in general.

03:29.415 --> 03:31.709
- "Scumbag henchmen for corporate America."
- Well...

03:31.792 --> 03:33.836
We just hired a full-time investigator.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.588
Whoever he is,
he's not as good as me.

03:35.671 --> 03:38.841
Hence me having offered you the job,
which you rejected.

03:38.925 --> 03:41.928
[sighs] Wasn't personal.
I just prefer freelance. No ties.

03:42.011 --> 03:44.472
So you said,
with an impressive string of expletives.

03:44.555 --> 03:46.015
[Jessica] Okay, is being drunk an excuse?

03:46.099 --> 03:48.017
[Hogarth] You know,
it's really about professionalism.

03:48.101 --> 03:49.893
You are erratic and you are volatile.

03:49.978 --> 03:53.522
[Jessica] Effective. You've brought me
eight jobs no one could deliver on.

03:53.606 --> 03:54.607
I did.

03:54.690 --> 03:57.860
And that is why
I have overlooked several complaints,

03:57.944 --> 04:00.821
and have kept your methods confidential.

04:01.948 --> 04:05.034
You're not protecting me.
You need my methods.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.121
I'm not gonna beg you for a case.

04:08.997 --> 04:11.832
I will ask you, though, very strongly.

04:14.752 --> 04:18.589
I need a summons served to
the owner of several gentlemen's clubs.

04:18.672 --> 04:20.341
His name is Gregory Spheeris.

04:22.676 --> 04:26.430
An exotic dancer fell off the stage
when a pole came loose.

04:26.514 --> 04:29.517
Severe concussion,
some permanent brain damage.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.560
Spheeris claims
she was always that stupid.

04:31.644 --> 04:35.273
- And you're repping who?
- The dancer, of course.

04:36.065 --> 04:39.527
The poor, brain-damaged dancer. And?

04:40.111 --> 04:42.405
Other parties interested
in Spheeris' property.

04:42.488 --> 04:44.865
Phew. I questioned my whole worldview
for a second there.

04:44.948 --> 04:47.785
Spheeris' bodyguards
make him very difficult to serve.

04:47.868 --> 04:49.162
Your specialty.

04:49.245 --> 04:52.373
This has gone a long way
toward me liking and trusting you.

04:54.750 --> 04:56.585
- [woman] <i>Gregory Spheeris' office.</i>
- [Jessica] Hi.

04:56.669 --> 04:59.213
I'm calling from Cal Jamshahi's office.

04:59.297 --> 05:01.424
My name is Karen.
Karen Accord.

05:01.507 --> 05:04.010
<i>- No, it's not.</i>
- Yes, it is.

05:04.093 --> 05:05.844
<i>From the Vanderbilt color guard?</i>

05:07.055 --> 05:08.764
- Yes!
<i>- This is Magda Simms!</i>

05:08.847 --> 05:12.060
Oh, my God, Magda! Thank God.
You have to help me.

05:12.143 --> 05:13.811
<i>Why? Why are you whispering?</i>

05:13.894 --> 05:18.816
Jamshahi is screaming about some meeting
he has with Mr. Spheeris,

05:18.899 --> 05:20.318
and I don't know where or when.

05:20.401 --> 05:22.986
[sighs] <i>Mr. Spheeris doesn't have</i>
<i>any meetings today.</i>

05:23.071 --> 05:25.698
No, it's not a meeting, it's...

05:25.781 --> 05:28.451
I don't know, a lunch, a dinner?
I can't read his handwriting.

05:28.534 --> 05:29.618
Oh, no.
Now, here he's coming.

05:29.702 --> 05:32.037
<i>Oh, could it be drinks?
Tomorrow, 7:00 p.m.?</i>

05:32.121 --> 05:35.166
<i>- He didn't say Jamshahi would be there.</i>
- That has to be it. Where?

05:35.249 --> 05:37.210
<i>Soho House, but it's members only.</i>

05:37.293 --> 05:39.837
Thank you so much,
I'll call you back.

05:43.382 --> 05:45.259
[sighs] Shit!

05:53.309 --> 05:54.310
[sighs]

06:18.876 --> 06:20.294
[sighs]

06:29.512 --> 06:30.763
[exhales sharply]

06:33.224 --> 06:34.642
[sighs] God damn it!

06:57.165 --> 07:00.251
[Jessica] <i>In my line of work,</i>
<i>you gotta know when to walk away.</i>

07:01.335 --> 07:04.046
<i>But some cases just won't let you go.</i>

07:05.047 --> 07:06.340
[grunts]

07:16.642 --> 07:17.893
[sighs]

07:36.078 --> 07:39.457
<i>Two minutes on a treadmill,
20 minutes on a quarter-pounder.</i>

07:51.969 --> 07:52.970
Ew!

08:03.897 --> 08:04.898
[camera clicks]

08:09.320 --> 08:10.488
[woman chuckles]

08:10.571 --> 08:12.240
[man speaking indistinctly]

08:16.076 --> 08:17.245
[woman] Uh-huh.

08:17.328 --> 08:18.662
[man continues talking]

08:19.455 --> 08:20.706
[camera clicks]

08:30.383 --> 08:32.174
[camera clicking]

09:28.732 --> 09:31.444
You want to do it.
You know you do.

09:31.527 --> 09:33.946
[panting]

09:40.077 --> 09:41.244
Main Street.

09:42.288 --> 09:43.456

09:44.873 --> 09:46.292

[indistinct arguing]

10:34.715 --> 10:36.592
[breathing deeply]

10:49.605 --> 10:52.650
- [ceiling banging]
- [woman] All right, all right.

11:09.917 --> 11:11.084
[charger clatters]

11:14.422 --> 11:16.590

11:17.925 --> 11:19.342

[rattling continues]

11:46.579 --> 11:47.996
[snoring]

11:54.294 --> 11:56.004
[sighs]

11:56.088 --> 11:59.216
God damn it, Malcolm.
You scared the shit out of me.

11:59.299 --> 12:02.177
- What are you doing in my apartment?
- This is my apartment.

12:02.803 --> 12:05.222
That's why it's not crunchy.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.726
[knife clatters]

12:09.602 --> 12:12.813
- You know, your door's broken.
- I hadn't noticed.

12:12.896 --> 12:15.357
You use sarcasm to distance people.

12:15.440 --> 12:18.193
And yet you're still here.
Now go the hell home.

12:19.152 --> 12:22.155
Oh. Excuse me,
you wouldn't be Jessica Jones?

12:22.239 --> 12:24.492
- Yeah.
- We tried to call.

12:25.534 --> 12:26.952
My phone's been acting up.

12:27.035 --> 12:29.788
But you are Jessica Jones,
private investigator?

12:33.333 --> 12:35.418
Yes, I'm a private investigator.

12:35.503 --> 12:39.047
I'm Barbara Shlottman,
this is my husband, Bob.

12:39.131 --> 12:42.050
We just flew in from Omaha
to find our missing daughter.

12:42.134 --> 12:44.427
Honey, Hope's not missing
if she still calls us once a week.

12:44.512 --> 12:46.096
She could be in a cult!

12:46.972 --> 12:48.140
Come on in.

12:48.974 --> 12:52.227
- Looks like you stripped your screws.
- Wouldn't be the first time.

12:53.687 --> 12:54.772
<i>Start at the beginning.</i>

12:54.855 --> 13:00.152
Hope is at NYU on an athletic scholarship.
Track and field, team captain.

13:01.403 --> 13:04.447
A month ago she called
to say that she was taking a break,

13:04.532 --> 13:06.449
which is not like her at all.

13:06.534 --> 13:09.244
She moved out of her apartment,
we don't know where.

13:09.327 --> 13:12.790
When she quit the team,
we got on the plane.

13:12.873 --> 13:14.625
You have a level?
I could hang this straight.

13:14.708 --> 13:16.168
She doesn't have a level, Bob.

13:17.210 --> 13:18.712
We went to the police.

13:18.796 --> 13:21.632
They said there was no evidence
of a crime being committed,

13:21.715 --> 13:24.593
and someone there
recommended that we contact you.

13:25.594 --> 13:27.304
The police referred you to me?

13:27.387 --> 13:29.932
- Why? Would that be unusual?
- Not at all.

13:31.058 --> 13:32.768
Has Hope had any problems in the past?

13:32.851 --> 13:36.939
God, no.
She's always been incredibly disciplined.

13:37.022 --> 13:38.148
How about epoxy?

13:38.231 --> 13:39.567
I could glue the screws in.
It'd be temporary, but...

13:39.650 --> 13:41.902
Stop with the damn door, Bob!

13:41.985 --> 13:45.781
And leave a woman living alone
in this city with no lock and no door?

13:45.864 --> 13:47.032
It's not safe!

13:56.917 --> 13:59.419
[sighs] That won't work.

14:01.338 --> 14:03.465
I charge hourly, plus expenses.

14:04.424 --> 14:05.968
I'll get a standard contract.

14:20.899 --> 14:22.985
Shlottmans.

14:23.068 --> 14:26.822
<i>Bob, general contractor.
Barbara, accountant.</i>

14:26.905 --> 14:28.949
<i>Not wealthy, but legit.</i>

14:29.032 --> 14:31.619
<i>Son, Owen.</i>

14:31.702 --> 14:33.746
<i>Daughter, Hope.</i>

14:33.829 --> 14:37.124
<i>Track, track, more track.</i>

14:38.083 --> 14:39.501
<i>Jesus, more track.</i>

14:40.628 --> 14:42.462
<i>Friend.</i>

14:51.930 --> 14:53.348
[woman] I'm playing tonight
if you want to come.

14:53.431 --> 14:55.058
[man] Yeah, definitely.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.533
[metal clings]

15:15.203 --> 15:16.496
It was open.

15:18.081 --> 15:19.792
Stop shooting.

15:19.875 --> 15:23.921
I'm making an experimental time lapse film
of a year in my life, so...

15:24.004 --> 15:25.547
Riveting.

15:25.631 --> 15:27.132
I found him on Craigslist.

15:27.215 --> 15:30.636
I suddenly needed a roommate, so...
Thanks a lot, Hope.

15:30.719 --> 15:32.304
You're pissed at her.

15:33.263 --> 15:35.598
Seriously, lose the camera, Coppola.

15:35.683 --> 15:38.852
I can't, it's a continuous shot.
That means that there's no cuts.

15:39.602 --> 15:41.396
Look at that, I found a cut.

15:41.479 --> 15:43.065
Oh! You destroyed my art!

15:43.148 --> 15:46.193
[sighs] Mercy killing.
Where's Hope's stuff?

15:46.276 --> 15:49.905
She told me to sell it for rent.
Made a whole 98 bucks.

15:49.988 --> 15:52.407
Well, there's a box of her leftover junk
in my closet.

15:54.617 --> 15:56.036
Go get it.

15:56.578 --> 15:57.830
Okay.

15:59.539 --> 16:02.918
She's not missing, you know.
She's just holed up with that guy.

16:03.001 --> 16:04.211
There's a guy?

16:04.294 --> 16:07.715
Of course there's a guy.
Why else would a best friend crap on you?

16:08.841 --> 16:11.093
She didn't mention him to her parents.

16:11.176 --> 16:12.845
They only talk about track.

16:12.928 --> 16:15.848
This guy have a name? A job?

16:15.931 --> 16:18.641
[Mei] All she'd tell me was,
"He's amazing!"

16:18.726 --> 16:20.853
I mean, did she think I was gonna
steal him or something?

16:20.936 --> 16:23.814
Look, she met a guy.
Case solved.

16:26.608 --> 16:28.819
You turn that thing on,
I'll pull your underwear through your eye.

16:31.864 --> 16:33.323
[metal clattering]

16:35.033 --> 16:37.077
[electronic music playing]

16:38.954 --> 16:40.789
Brr! Sucks to be you.

16:41.874 --> 16:44.042
Yo! Chop chop!
Quick like a bunny!

16:44.126 --> 16:45.711
Where's my car?

16:56.304 --> 16:57.765
Be back in my place in ten.

17:05.396 --> 17:07.273
[tires squealing]

17:07.357 --> 17:09.358
[loud music playing on car stereo]

17:13.488 --> 17:14.740
[Jessica] Excuse me.

17:15.866 --> 17:17.826
I said excuse me.

17:17.910 --> 17:19.452
Do you know the way to
the Chrysler Building?

17:19.536 --> 17:22.204
It's called Google Maps, moron.

17:23.123 --> 17:25.917
- [gears grinding]
- [metal creaking]

17:29.504 --> 17:32.049
- [engine revving]
- What the...

17:35.302 --> 17:37.888
How are you doing that?

17:38.013 --> 17:39.973
You're... one of them.

17:41.099 --> 17:42.684
Holy mother of God!

17:46.563 --> 17:47.647
[grunts]

17:49.691 --> 17:52.778
You know, you'll spend less
settling this lawsuit

17:52.861 --> 17:54.905
than you did on those hair plugs.

17:54.988 --> 17:56.114
You're not normal.

17:57.157 --> 17:59.451
It's people like you
that give people like you a bad name.

17:59.534 --> 18:01.369
Take the damn summons, Spheeris.

18:01.453 --> 18:04.497
No, no. If you even touch me,
I'll tell the world about you.

18:04.581 --> 18:06.749
There'll be nowhere to hide.

18:06.834 --> 18:09.711
Do I look like I'm hiding? No.

18:09.795 --> 18:10.838
You wanna know why?

18:10.921 --> 18:13.215
Because no one wants to know.

18:13.298 --> 18:15.092
They want to feel safe.

18:15.175 --> 18:17.970
They'd rather call you crazy
than admit that I can lift this car,

18:18.053 --> 18:21.139
or that I can melt your insides
with my laser eyes...

18:21.223 --> 18:23.266
which won't leave a trace.

18:24.517 --> 18:25.811
[grunts]

18:29.689 --> 18:33.651
Mr. Gregory Spheeris, you've been served.

18:33.735 --> 18:35.028
[camera shutter clicks]

18:35.112 --> 18:37.322
"Laser eyes." Moron.

18:37.405 --> 18:38.698
[Spheeris panting]

18:54.381 --> 18:56.133
[objects clattering]

18:56.216 --> 18:57.467
[exhales]

19:02.848 --> 19:04.182
[exhales shakily]

19:05.767 --> 19:07.519
[inhaling deeply]

19:08.811 --> 19:10.939
Birch Street. [exhales sharply]

19:14.109 --> 19:15.527
Higgins Drive.

19:19.239 --> 19:20.657
Cobalt Lane.

19:29.457 --> 19:31.251
[inhales deeply]

19:31.334 --> 19:33.253
[cell phone ringing]

19:40.218 --> 19:44.222
You work this late so you can return calls
without actually reaching people.

19:44.306 --> 19:45.515
[Hogarth] <i>Well, I reached you.</i>

19:45.598 --> 19:48.851
- I received your message.
<i>- So cut a check.</i>

19:48.936 --> 19:51.313
And I also received a call
from Spheeris' attorney.

19:51.396 --> 19:53.440
Spheeris claims you, and I quote,

19:53.523 --> 19:57.735
"lifted his car overhead
and threatened him with your laser eyes."

19:57.819 --> 19:58.861
Pathetic.

19:58.946 --> 20:02.615
<i>- Did you threaten him?</i>
- Yep, with my laser eyes.

20:02.699 --> 20:04.910
And he believed that bullshit.

20:04.993 --> 20:07.120
<i>I could have said my hands were blenders.</i>

20:07.204 --> 20:09.872
<i>Clearly, there's no IQ test
for owning a strip club.</i>

20:09.957 --> 20:12.292
Well, people believe
some pretty strange things these days.

20:12.375 --> 20:14.586
Look, if you're gonna call me volatile
or whatever else,

20:14.669 --> 20:15.921
I'm really not in the mood.

20:16.004 --> 20:17.672
No, no.

20:17.755 --> 20:20.592
No, it sounds like it was very calculated.

20:20.675 --> 20:22.302
Only wish I could have been there.

20:23.761 --> 20:25.388
Was that a compliment?

20:26.306 --> 20:27.765
I'll notify payroll.

20:27.849 --> 20:29.017
[cell phone beeps]

21:02.009 --> 21:03.676
[indistinct conversations]

21:15.022 --> 21:17.149
[blues music playing faintly]

21:27.075 --> 21:28.160
[indistinct conversations]

21:28.243 --> 21:29.619
[man] It's a pleasure talking to you.

21:56.313 --> 21:58.815
[man] You could drink that out of a glass.

22:04.154 --> 22:06.531
This whiskey's not good enough
to put in a glass.

22:07.865 --> 22:10.077
Yeah? I've got better stuff in there.

22:11.244 --> 22:13.746
I've seen you around here,
but you never come inside.

22:14.956 --> 22:16.499
I buy in bulk.

22:17.917 --> 22:20.212
It's ladies' night.
New promotion I'm running.

22:20.295 --> 22:23.090
[scoffs] No, it's not.

22:23.923 --> 22:25.425
It is now.

22:26.259 --> 22:27.260
Why?

22:27.969 --> 22:32.724
You're local, you're hot, drinking alone.
Tends to attract customers.

22:32.807 --> 22:35.268
But hey, don't do me any favors.

22:43.818 --> 22:45.069
[sighs]

22:49.991 --> 22:51.243
[Roy] Headin' out, boss.

22:52.202 --> 22:55.037
- Be good, Roy.
- Why start now, huh?

22:55.122 --> 22:56.706
[laughing]

22:58.333 --> 23:00.293
[Roy coughing]

23:01.419 --> 23:02.712
Last call.

23:04.088 --> 23:05.882
Still ladies' night?

23:08.676 --> 23:10.262
Make it a double.

23:14.724 --> 23:16.684
Lot of booze for such a small woman.

23:18.561 --> 23:20.897
I don't get asked
on a lot of second dates.

23:20.980 --> 23:22.649
[chuckles softly]

23:23.816 --> 23:25.568
How long you been doing this?

23:26.944 --> 23:28.280
A while.

23:29.156 --> 23:32.450
You from around here?
You got family here? Friends?

23:33.535 --> 23:34.744
I got regulars.

23:38.998 --> 23:40.417
Hard day at the office?

23:41.334 --> 23:42.835
They're all hard.

23:43.961 --> 23:45.463
Pops always said,

23:45.547 --> 23:47.757
if you don't feel good going to work,
you should find new work.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.926
I did that. I'm working the new work.

23:50.009 --> 23:52.220
Yeah? What kind of business you in?

23:55.097 --> 23:56.974
[clicks tongue] Right.

23:57.058 --> 23:59.769
- You only ask questions.
- I'm still waiting on answers.

24:00.937 --> 24:02.439
Ladies first.

24:13.283 --> 24:14.409
You're a P.I.?

24:14.492 --> 24:18.538
I'm just trying to make a living.
You know, booze costs money. Usually.

24:19.372 --> 24:21.458
There's better ways to hustle
than digging in people's business.

24:21.541 --> 24:23.585
It's the only thing I'm good at.

24:23.668 --> 24:25.878
- How good?
- A natural.

24:25.962 --> 24:27.171
Yeah?

24:28.506 --> 24:30.383
So what have you detected?

24:30.467 --> 24:34.304
Well, I can tell
by the residue on this bar

24:34.387 --> 24:38.308
that four years ago,
a man named Horace had buffalo wings.

24:39.183 --> 24:40.810
His name was Melvin.

24:44.856 --> 24:48.067
I stand in dark alleys and wait
to take pictures of people boning.

24:49.527 --> 24:51.863
Except you been watching me like a hawk
since you walked in.

24:51.946 --> 24:53.072
Force of habit.

24:54.657 --> 24:56.868
Or it's your way of flirting.

24:56.951 --> 24:59.996
I don't flirt. But you do.

25:00.079 --> 25:02.374
Not for sport. It's got purpose.

25:02.457 --> 25:05.167
Like getting customers to drink more.
Tip more.

25:08.212 --> 25:09.631
So what else ya got, Sherlock?

25:10.673 --> 25:11.966
All right.

25:13.175 --> 25:17.514
A drunk spills on your shirt,
pukes on your shoe, and you roll with it.

25:18.515 --> 25:21.768
But break or scratch something?
He's toast.

25:22.727 --> 25:26.188
I've never seen a dive bar this clean.

25:26.273 --> 25:28.024
Because you care about it.

25:28.107 --> 25:29.734
More than anything.

25:30.735 --> 25:32.779
Maybe anyone.

25:32.862 --> 25:34.531
There's history here.

25:35.990 --> 25:37.199
Memories.

25:38.868 --> 25:41.954
Something personal, but private.

25:42.038 --> 25:44.416
So no photos or memorabilia.

25:45.583 --> 25:47.544
But you also like women.

25:47.627 --> 25:49.504
Temporarily, at least.

25:50.880 --> 25:53.215
And they like you.

25:54.133 --> 25:56.135
See, now that sounded like flirting to me.

25:56.218 --> 25:59.472
Again, I don't flirt.
I just say what I want.

26:01.057 --> 26:02.684
And what do you want?

26:05.812 --> 26:07.397
[both moaning]

26:16.531 --> 26:18.074
- [grunts] My bad, my bad.
- [grunts]

26:18.157 --> 26:19.826
It's okay. It's okay, I won't break.

26:19.909 --> 26:21.953
Yeah, you will.

26:22.662 --> 26:24.622
[sighing]

26:39.679 --> 26:40.888
Here.

27:12.128 --> 27:14.506
[sighs heavily]

27:23.723 --> 27:25.057
[sighs]

28:05.765 --> 28:07.308
[sniffles]

28:07.391 --> 28:08.851
[exhales sharply]

28:33.876 --> 28:35.044
Sorry.

28:51.603 --> 28:52.979
[retching]

29:08.703 --> 29:10.538
[indistinct arguing]

29:12.457 --> 29:13.916
[man] You didn't do it perfectly.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.878
You didn't do it perfectly,
so now it's all your fault.

29:16.961 --> 29:18.212
[woman] Oh, yeah? Yeah?

29:18.295 --> 29:19.338
Assholes!

29:19.421 --> 29:20.715
- [cell phone ringing]
- [man] And I just noticed

29:20.798 --> 29:21.924
you put all my laundry...

29:22.008 --> 29:23.510
[woman] All I asked...

29:27.179 --> 29:28.430
Alias Investigations.

29:28.515 --> 29:30.892
[Barbara] <i>It's Barb Shlottman,</i>
<i>Hope's mom.</i>

29:30.975 --> 29:32.894
Yeah. Yes. Hi, I was just...

29:32.977 --> 29:35.647
<i>What's wrong? You sound funny.
Is it... Is it Hope?</i>

29:35.730 --> 29:39.776
No, it was just a long night
researching your case.

29:41.110 --> 29:44.781
Um, Hope made some recent charges
on her credit card.

29:44.864 --> 29:46.198
[Barbara] <i>She never uses that card.</i>

29:46.282 --> 29:49.786
<i>We just gave it to her for emergencies.
But we raised her to be frugal.</i>

29:49.869 --> 29:53.122
[Jessica] <i>So she didn't mention</i>
<i>wanting to buy anything special?</i>

29:53.205 --> 29:56.083
[Barbara] <i>No. Why? What did she buy?</i>

29:56.167 --> 29:57.710
[Jessica] <i>Nothing unusual.</i>

30:03.007 --> 30:06.135
[Jessica in voiceover] <i>Hope's going</i>
<i>overboard to make her boyfriend happy.</i>

30:07.386 --> 30:11.057
<i>She's either an idiot in love,
or she's being conned.</i>

30:13.309 --> 30:15.728
<i>Which amount to
pretty much the same thing.</i>

30:36.583 --> 30:37.750
No.

30:37.834 --> 30:40.211
[breathing heavily] No way.

31:01.190 --> 31:03.317
I'm sorry, ma'am,
we're not open for dinner yet.

31:03.400 --> 31:05.236
- Didn't this used to be Il Rosso?
- Yes.

31:05.319 --> 31:09.490
Niku opened eight months ago.
May I make a reservation for you?

31:09.574 --> 31:11.075
Have you seen this girl?

31:12.201 --> 31:13.244
May I ask why?

31:13.327 --> 31:15.454
I'm a private investigator.

31:16.205 --> 31:18.415
- I don't want any more trouble.
- Any more?

31:18.499 --> 31:19.959
So she was here.

31:20.627 --> 31:21.794
Last Tuesday.

31:23.379 --> 31:24.505
Was she alone?

31:24.589 --> 31:27.759
- You should really speak to my manager.
- Just tell me what happened.

31:31.262 --> 31:35.975
Her companion wanted
a particular table in the back.

31:36.809 --> 31:39.353
There was a couple already seated there.

31:39.436 --> 31:42.690
But I lost my mind or something.
I told them to leave.

31:43.691 --> 31:44.859
No, that's not possible.

31:44.942 --> 31:48.863
What's not possible is our sommelier
comping him a $500 bottle.

31:48.946 --> 31:52.158
And when he ordered his favorite dish,
from Il Rosso,

31:52.241 --> 31:57.204
our chef actually hunted down the recipe
from Il Rosso's old chef.

31:57.914 --> 31:59.624
[indistinct conversations]

32:16.557 --> 32:20.436
[man in English accent]
To our anniversary. You'll love it.

32:20.519 --> 32:21.603
I will love it.

32:22.647 --> 32:23.690
Then smile.

32:23.773 --> 32:26.192
I can't imagine why he came
to an Asian fusion restaurant

32:26.275 --> 32:30.112
- to order classic Italian pasta...
- Amatriciana.

32:31.072 --> 32:32.699
You know him?

32:32.782 --> 32:35.409
He's not coming back, is he?

32:35.492 --> 32:36.869
Ma'am?

32:48.005 --> 32:50.549
Birch Street, Higgins Drive...

32:54.887 --> 32:55.888
Shit.

33:17.076 --> 33:18.494
Miss Jones. What is it?

33:18.577 --> 33:22.498
Who gave you my name?
Which police officer told you about me?

33:22.581 --> 33:24.792
- What's going on? Is it Hope?
- Is she okay?

33:24.876 --> 33:27.962
Did you get the cop's name
who referred me?

33:28.045 --> 33:29.463
It wasn't a policeman.

33:29.546 --> 33:32.091
You said someone at the station...

33:32.174 --> 33:36.512
- He was filing a complaint.
- Or paying a ticket. What does it matter?

33:36.595 --> 33:37.722
What did he say?

33:38.389 --> 33:42.852
He said he overheard our conversation
with the desk sergeant about Hope,

33:42.935 --> 33:44.145
and suggested we come to you.

33:44.228 --> 33:46.188
He had a nice accent, English.

33:47.398 --> 33:50.067
Pack. Go home.

33:51.152 --> 33:52.194
Get the hell out of here.

33:52.278 --> 33:53.863
What? Why? Who is this guy?

33:53.946 --> 33:55.281
[Barbara]
Does he have our daughter?

33:55.364 --> 33:56.866
Don't let anyone near you, just go!

33:56.949 --> 33:58.325
Are you going to find her?

33:59.576 --> 34:02.246
I need one coach ticket
on the next flight to Hong Kong.

34:02.329 --> 34:04.081
[man] <i>That would be departing</i>
<i>in three hours.</i>

34:04.165 --> 34:05.249
I'll take it.

34:05.332 --> 34:07.209
<i>Perfect.
I just need your credit card information.</i>

34:07.293 --> 34:09.085
Okay, it's a MasterCard.

34:10.545 --> 34:15.842
The number is
5-2-7-4-9-3-3-2-0-6-8...

34:15.927 --> 34:18.469
That's Hope Shlottman, two T's.

34:19.429 --> 34:20.973
<i>I'm sorry, that card was declined.</i>

34:21.056 --> 34:22.183
Shit!

34:23.350 --> 34:25.978
Okay.
Can you just hold the ticket for me?

34:26.062 --> 34:27.521
<i>We don't hold tickets.</i>

34:30.357 --> 34:31.859
Okay.

34:33.444 --> 34:35.154
[dialing]

34:35.237 --> 34:36.655
[line ringing]

34:38.199 --> 34:39.616
[Hogarth] <i>Yes?</i>

34:39.699 --> 34:41.743
I need to get paid
for the Spheeris job now.

34:41.828 --> 34:44.330
I put it through payroll.
It takes a few days. You know that.

34:44.413 --> 34:46.165
Okay, then I need a loan.

34:46.248 --> 34:48.793
<i>That's not how I conduct business.
You will have to ask a friend.</i>

34:48.876 --> 34:50.210
I don't have any goddamn friends.

34:50.293 --> 34:52.629
[scoffs] I'm shocked.

34:52.713 --> 34:53.840
Jessica?

34:55.967 --> 34:58.886
Here you are.
I was waiting downstairs.

34:59.761 --> 35:00.972
Oh.

35:04.892 --> 35:08.855
We should go.
We'll be late for our reservation.

35:08.938 --> 35:12.149
- And whose fault is that?
- [chuckles lightly]

35:24.912 --> 35:26.413
- [cell phone beeps]
- [sighs]

35:26.497 --> 35:27.999
[line ringing]

35:41.846 --> 35:43.430
[Malcolm grunts]

35:43.514 --> 35:44.806
[sighs]

35:46.558 --> 35:48.644
- You look bad.
- I need money.

35:49.770 --> 35:51.397
You can have my TV.

35:53.315 --> 35:55.192
Thanks, Malcolm.
You keep it.

35:57.319 --> 35:59.113
- I stole it.
- I figured.

36:06.162 --> 36:07.746
[Trish] Can we at least try
to get Madeleine Albright?

36:07.829 --> 36:10.749
It's a lifestyle show, Trish.
Our audiences tune out for politics.

36:10.832 --> 36:13.085
- They do not.
- Okay, I do.

36:13.169 --> 36:14.545
I want to meet Madeleine Albright.

36:14.628 --> 36:15.837
I want to meet Channing Tatum,

36:15.922 --> 36:17.256
but I've never tried
to book him on the show.

36:17.339 --> 36:19.841
Yes, you have.
He said no.

36:23.012 --> 36:26.223
Oh, I'm sorry, Zack, it's late and...

36:26.307 --> 36:28.642
Yeah. Yeah, we'll pick this up
at the station tomorrow.

36:28.725 --> 36:29.851
Thank you.

36:29.936 --> 36:31.020
Come on.

36:33.772 --> 36:35.983
- Thanks, Zack.
- Yeah. Nice.

36:43.074 --> 36:44.450
Bye, guys.

36:45.159 --> 36:46.660
- [door closes]
- [door locks]

37:10.101 --> 37:11.393
You could've used the door.

37:11.477 --> 37:14.981
I wasn't sure you'd answer.
It's important.

37:16.023 --> 37:17.608
It must be.

37:18.400 --> 37:21.445
It's for a case.

37:21.528 --> 37:23.322
Right.

37:23.405 --> 37:26.033
You became a private eye.

37:26.117 --> 37:27.618
You've been keeping tabs on me?

37:27.701 --> 37:30.621
Making sure you weren't dead,
since you never called.

37:32.206 --> 37:33.374
I need money.

37:33.457 --> 37:34.708
[scoffs]

37:36.961 --> 37:38.504
Wow. Uh...

37:39.796 --> 37:41.215
I don't even know what to say.

37:41.298 --> 37:42.841
- It's important.
- You said.

37:42.924 --> 37:46.762
But I don't hear from you for months,
six months, actually...

37:46.845 --> 37:49.348
- I needed breathing room.
- You shut me out.

37:49.431 --> 37:52.226
And now you show up here asking for money?

37:52.309 --> 37:53.352
This was a bad idea.

37:53.435 --> 37:57.398
No, you talk to me.
You tell me what the hell is so important.

38:00.109 --> 38:01.193
He's back.

38:04.571 --> 38:06.032
It's been a year, Jess.

38:07.033 --> 38:08.575
You saw him die.

38:09.618 --> 38:12.997
You saw his death certificate.
This is just your PTSD...

38:13.080 --> 38:16.292
It's not my goddamn PTSD.

38:16.375 --> 38:18.335
Are you still having nightmares?

38:19.295 --> 38:20.546
Flashbacks?

38:23.049 --> 38:24.466
[sighs]

38:25.759 --> 38:27.261
You need to go back to that therapist.

38:27.344 --> 38:29.846
That quack that had me
reciting street names from back home?

38:29.930 --> 38:31.473
A proven method for managing PTSD.

38:31.557 --> 38:33.725
Two hundred bucks for "Birch Street,
Cobalt Lane, Bullshit Drive."

38:33.809 --> 38:36.437
- I told you I'd pay for it.
- Jesus Christ, Trish!

38:37.438 --> 38:38.730
He's back.

38:39.690 --> 38:42.776
He sent clients to me,
this couple from Omaha.

38:42.859 --> 38:44.611
He took their daughter.

38:45.696 --> 38:46.738
Why her?

38:46.822 --> 38:50.284
- Is she gifted?
- A gifted athlete, maybe.

38:50.367 --> 38:51.868
Next best thing?
I don't know.

38:51.952 --> 38:57.166
But remember I told you
he had that one month anniversary night?

38:57.249 --> 39:00.294
And now one month
from the day he took Hope,

39:00.377 --> 39:01.545
he's doing...

39:02.671 --> 39:06.800
the lingerie, the gift, the restaurant.

39:06.883 --> 39:07.926
The hotel?

39:10.971 --> 39:12.514
I'm calling the police.

39:12.598 --> 39:14.266
They can't help, Trish.

39:15.392 --> 39:17.018
You know what he can do.

39:18.437 --> 39:20.439
You know what he made me do.

39:21.898 --> 39:23.234
So you're running.

39:24.193 --> 39:26.237
Yeah, I sure as hell am.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.239
If he gets a hold of me again...

39:31.742 --> 39:32.951
Trish...

39:33.034 --> 39:35.121
If you leave that girl with him, and...

39:35.204 --> 39:37.748
What would you have me do?
What exactly should I do?

39:37.831 --> 39:39.541
We'll figure out a way to protect you.

39:39.625 --> 39:42.961
We? He's coming for me, not you.

39:43.044 --> 39:44.213
I know!

39:45.881 --> 39:46.923
You don't.

39:47.007 --> 39:49.135
I know one thing,
you are far better equipped

39:49.218 --> 39:52.721
to deal with that animal
than some innocent girl from Omaha.

39:56.808 --> 40:00.937
You're still the person
who tried to do something.

40:03.357 --> 40:05.066
Tried and failed.

40:06.318 --> 40:08.195
That's what started this.

40:10.531 --> 40:13.074
I was never the hero
that you wanted me to be.

40:16.787 --> 40:17.954
I'll get your money.

40:51.029 --> 40:52.448
[sighs]

40:52.531 --> 40:54.866
[Bob] <i>Where is our daughter?</i>
<i>What's going on? Please.</i>

41:00.247 --> 41:03.959
[Barbara sobbing] <i>Please,</i>
<i>please just tell me where my baby is.</i>

41:05.169 --> 41:07.838
I need to make a stop uptown.
59th and Fifth.

41:23.770 --> 41:25.021
Miss Jones?

41:27.941 --> 41:29.485
I thought that was you.

41:29.568 --> 41:31.778
Welcome back. Uh...

41:31.862 --> 41:33.947
Will you be staying with us again?

42:06.313 --> 42:07.939
[alarm ringing]

42:11.443 --> 42:12.653
[woman] What's going on?

42:13.279 --> 42:14.446
[people talking indistinctly]

43:19.219 --> 43:20.304
[man] You miss me?

43:20.387 --> 43:21.722
[gasps]

43:50.667 --> 43:52.919
[breathing shakily]

43:57.758 --> 43:59.385
Is he here?

43:59.468 --> 44:01.094
Is Kilgrave here?

44:02.137 --> 44:03.263
No.

44:04.180 --> 44:05.932
How long?
When did he leave?

44:06.016 --> 44:09.060
Five hours and 21 minutes.

44:11.980 --> 44:13.399
We have to get you out of here.

44:14.608 --> 44:16.943
- Let's go. Get dressed.
- I can't.

44:18.278 --> 44:19.446
- [cell phone beeps]
- [line ringing]

44:19.530 --> 44:21.365
- [Bob] <i>Miss Jones?</i>
- Mr. Shlottman, I found Hope.

44:21.448 --> 44:23.324
Is that my dad?

44:23.409 --> 44:26.036
You have to get her
as far away as you can.

44:26.119 --> 44:28.705
Check out of your hotel,
and go directly to my office.

44:28.789 --> 44:29.790
[Bob] <i>I don't understand.</i>

44:29.873 --> 44:31.792
[Barbara] <i>Please, God, what...</i>
<i>what is happening?</i>

44:31.875 --> 44:34.628
[sighs] Just do it!
We'll meet you there.

44:34.711 --> 44:36.129
Come on, let's go!

44:36.212 --> 44:38.632
- I can't.
- [sighs]

44:39.716 --> 44:41.552
He told you not to move.

44:43.470 --> 44:45.013
I wet the bed.

44:49.601 --> 44:50.852
[sighs] Okay.

44:52.563 --> 44:54.565
- Come on. Let's go. Come on. Hope!
- No, I can't!

44:54.648 --> 44:57.609
- Come on, come on.
- No, no, no!

44:57.693 --> 44:59.778
- Come on.
- No! No!

44:59.861 --> 45:01.947
No! I can't leave.

45:02.030 --> 45:03.824
- I don't want to hurt you.
- I can't leave.

45:03.907 --> 45:05.951
I can't!

45:06.034 --> 45:09.162
Let go of me!
I can't leave!

45:09.245 --> 45:11.372
- Yes, you can.
- I can't leave!

45:11.457 --> 45:13.416
- Come on!
- I can't!

45:14.585 --> 45:15.919
I can't...

45:16.419 --> 45:17.671
[screams]

45:21.592 --> 45:23.552
- No! No!
- [grunts]

45:23.635 --> 45:25.428
Put me down!

45:25.512 --> 45:26.805
No!

45:28.181 --> 45:29.349
No, I can't leave!

45:29.432 --> 45:33.394
I can't, I can't!
[grunting]

45:33.479 --> 45:37.107
- No! Let me go!
- [lamp clattering]

45:37.190 --> 45:38.775
[grunting]

45:40.360 --> 45:43.572
- No! [grunts] I can't...
- [thuds]

45:48.869 --> 45:53.665
His control, whatever it is,
it wears off.

45:53.749 --> 45:57.628
But it takes time and distance,
so we're both getting out of here.

45:57.711 --> 46:02.633
[sniffling] He made me do things that...

46:03.424 --> 46:07.428
I didn't want to do, but I wanted to.

46:13.393 --> 46:14.770
[sniffles]

46:16.938 --> 46:19.274
What street did you live on as a kid?

46:20.776 --> 46:22.235
What was the name?

46:23.236 --> 46:24.905
Picture the sign.

46:27.490 --> 46:31.036
Harrison. Harrison Street.

46:31.119 --> 46:33.163
And the next block over?

46:34.372 --> 46:35.707
Florence.

46:38.126 --> 46:40.587
- [sighs]
- Listen to me.

46:41.547 --> 46:43.131
None of it is your fault.

46:43.924 --> 46:45.466
You don't know.

46:45.551 --> 46:47.093
I know.

46:48.469 --> 46:50.764
Okay? I know.

46:53.099 --> 46:54.935
I want you to say it.

46:55.936 --> 46:58.188
"None of it is my fault."

46:58.271 --> 47:00.273
Say it back to me.

47:01.441 --> 47:04.194
It's not my...

47:04.277 --> 47:05.278
[sniffles]

47:08.323 --> 47:10.033
[sighs]

47:10.116 --> 47:11.492
It's...

47:11.577 --> 47:13.244
It's not my fault.

47:14.204 --> 47:15.371
Good. That was good.

47:15.455 --> 47:17.624
- [door closing]
- [footsteps approaching]

47:17.708 --> 47:19.585
- [Bob] My little girl.
- [Barbara] Oh, thank God. Thank God.

47:19.668 --> 47:22.420
- [Hope] It's not my fault.
- [sobbing] I know, sweetheart.

47:22.503 --> 47:23.714
She'll be okay.

47:24.756 --> 47:27.092
You just have to keep her away
from the man who took her.

47:27.175 --> 47:30.511
- Took her?
- He... escaped.

47:32.055 --> 47:34.808
And right now your only concern
is putting Hope in a car

47:34.891 --> 47:37.352
and driving west,
and don't stop until you hit Omaha.

47:38.729 --> 47:40.981
We're taking our baby home.
Thank you.

47:41.064 --> 47:42.733
- [Bob] Thank you, Ms. Jones.
- It's fine.

47:47.445 --> 47:48.822
You saved my life.

47:53.994 --> 47:55.078
Go!

47:56.454 --> 47:58.248
I'm right behind you.

48:19.853 --> 48:21.271
[elevator bell dings]

48:39.790 --> 48:40.916
No!

48:40.999 --> 48:42.083

- [gun firing]

48:43.710 --> 48:45.712

49:04.564 --> 49:06.482
[gun clicking]

49:14.700 --> 49:16.659

[screaming] Mom!

[Jessica] <i>One, keep denying it.</i>

<i>Or two...</i>
