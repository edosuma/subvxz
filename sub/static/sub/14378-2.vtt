00:42.483 --> 00:47.233
[Clock ticking]

00:57.233 --> 00:58.450
Tell me.
No.

00:58.483 --> 01:00.200
No.
Tell me.

01:00.233 --> 01:02.016
Tell me.
No.

01:02.050 --> 01:02.483
Tell me.

01:03.016 --> 01:04.216
Dexter,
for the last time--

01:04.250 --> 01:06.083
tell me! Tell me!
Tell me!

01:06.116 --> 01:07.100
Absolutely not.

01:07.133 --> 01:08.316
But I must know.

01:08.350 --> 01:11.366
And you shall...
In exactly 7 days.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.450
But I can't wait
that long.

01:13.483 --> 01:15.433
You've already waited
almost a year.

01:15.466 --> 01:17.166
What's another 7 days?

01:17.200 --> 01:23.016
Well, technically,
there are still 7 days,
14 hours, and 36--

01:23.050 --> 01:25.083
make that
35 minutes left.

01:25.116 --> 01:28.050
And the answer
is<i>sti</i>

01:28.083 --> 01:29.166
that's final!

01:29.200 --> 01:30.133
Now, if you don't mind,

01:30.166 --> 01:31.466
I have a very important
article

01:32.000 --> 01:34.283
on car waxes to read.

01:35.016 --> 01:36.333
Ha ha ha!

01:36.366 --> 01:38.000
Boys.

01:38.033 --> 01:39.333
[Door slams]

01:45.383 --> 01:47.383
Hi, Dexter!

01:47.416 --> 01:49.366
Why the long face,
Dexter?

01:49.400 --> 01:51.100
[Sighs]

01:51.133 --> 01:52.100
Dad won't tell me

01:52.133 --> 01:54.166
what he's giving me
for my birthday.

01:54.200 --> 01:58.283
Ha ha, Dexter,
silly! For someone
who's so smart,

01:58.316 --> 01:59.366
you sure are dumb.

01:59.400 --> 02:03.116
Don't you know?
Dad never
tells a secret.

02:03.150 --> 02:07.250
You'd have to be
a mind reader to
figure this one out.

02:39.016 --> 02:40.400
I am still alive.

02:40.433 --> 02:45.483
My cerebellic transfer wave
inducer is a success.

02:46.016 --> 02:51.066
I can now read the minds
of whomever I wish.

02:54.316 --> 02:57.466
Dad, what did you get me
for my birthday?

02:58.000 --> 02:59.100
Overslept again,
Dex?

02:59.133 --> 03:01.400
I see you didn't
even have time
to comb your hair.

03:01.433 --> 03:04.183
I said, what did
you get me

03:04.216 --> 03:05.383
for my birthday?

03:05.416 --> 03:06.450
[Thinking]
Heh heh heh!

03:06.483 --> 03:10.016
Now I shall
read his mind.

03:10.050 --> 03:13.083
Ha ha!
When pigs fly, Dexter.

03:13.116 --> 03:15.033
The answer
is still no.

03:15.066 --> 03:15.383
Huh?

03:15.416 --> 03:16.266
Mom:
Come on, son.

03:16.300 --> 03:17.350
No time
for chitchat.

03:17.383 --> 03:20.116
Now, Dexter. Sit down
and eat your breakfast.

03:20.150 --> 03:25.000
Dexter, thinking:
Yuck! Mom's oatmeal
tastes like barf.

03:25.033 --> 03:25.383
Oh!

03:25.416 --> 03:27.466
Dexter,
don't be rude!

03:28.000 --> 03:28.416
Huh?

03:28.450 --> 03:30.166
[Thinking]
That sister of mine:

03:30.200 --> 03:32.316
What
a ferocious pig!

03:32.350 --> 03:34.166
Hey! I'm no pig!

03:34.200 --> 03:37.466
That is enough, Dexter.
Time for school.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.100
But wait.
Dad, what--

03:39.133 --> 03:41.016
the answer is no.
Now git!

03:41.050 --> 03:45.150
[Thinking]
Dad with his stubborn
poo-poo doodyhead!

03:45.183 --> 03:46.066
Dad: I heard that.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.066
Mom: And we
are gonna have

03:47.100 --> 03:49.016
a serious talk
about your potty mouth

03:49.050 --> 03:50.250
when you get home
from school today.

03:50.283 --> 03:54.316
[Thinking]
Wait. How come I could not
read dad's mind?

03:54.350 --> 03:56.366
Why did mom say I was rude?

03:56.400 --> 04:01.000
How did Dee Dee know
I called her a ferocious pig?

04:01.033 --> 04:01.483
Unless...

04:02.016 --> 04:05.266
Oh, no. My invention
has backfired.

04:05.300 --> 04:07.033
I must get back to the--

04:07.066 --> 04:08.066
Dee Dee: Come on, Dexter.

04:08.100 --> 04:09.466
We're gonna be late
for the school bus.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.350
[Thinking]
Oh, no! What have I done?

04:12.383 --> 04:14.366
Everyone can read
my thoughts.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.450
I must keep my mind blank.

04:16.483 --> 04:19.000
Did you say
something, Dex?

04:19.033 --> 04:20.400
Not quite.

04:21.016 --> 04:24.250
[Thinking]
Heh heh. I must keep
my mind blank,

04:24.283 --> 04:25.433
keep an empty head.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.366
Empty head.
Empty head.

04:27.400 --> 04:30.450
Hey! Who are
you calling
an empty head?

04:30.483 --> 04:32.033
Get back here!

04:32.066 --> 04:34.183
[Thinking]
Don't think anything.
Nothing--

04:34.216 --> 04:35.283
nothing at all.

04:35.316 --> 04:37.433
Oh, but that kid
is so ugly,

04:37.466 --> 04:40.133
and that one
has crazy hair.

04:40.166 --> 04:42.250
Oh, and look at
those braces.

04:42.283 --> 04:46.400
Chubby cheeks, pizza face,
pencil nose, sasquatch.

04:46.433 --> 04:49.383
Oh, what am I thinking?

04:53.466 --> 04:56.466
Heh heh heh.
Just kidding.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.083
Hey, what's up
with that kid?

04:59.116 --> 05:01.016
Dee Dee's
little brother.

05:01.050 --> 05:02.266
Ah.

05:03.233 --> 05:05.116
[Thinking]
I must get through school

05:05.150 --> 05:08.183
as safely
and as swiftly as possible.

05:08.216 --> 05:09.383
Good morning, class.

05:09.416 --> 05:12.383
Class: Good morning,
Mr. Muzinsky.

05:12.416 --> 05:15.166
Mr. Muzinsky: Hope everyone
had a wonderful weekend.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.100
[Thinking]
Don't say anything.
Don't think anything.

05:18.133 --> 05:23.050
Now, today we are going to
discuss one of my favorite
historical figures:

05:23.083 --> 05:24.200
George Washington carver.

05:24.233 --> 05:27.383
[Thinking]
Yes. All I have to do
is take notes.

05:27.416 --> 05:28.416
No thinking.

05:28.450 --> 05:30.000
Mr. Muzinsky:
George Washington carver,

05:30.033 --> 05:33.466
born in diamond grove,
Missouri, around 1860,

05:34.016 --> 05:36.400
developed over 300 uses
for peanuts.

05:36.433 --> 05:38.483
Dexter, thinking:
300 uses for peanuts.

05:39.016 --> 05:41.383
One of carver's
most infamous uses
for peanuts...

05:41.416 --> 05:43.116
Dexter, thinking:
Uses for peanuts...

05:43.150 --> 05:44.333
Was his crop rotation
method,

05:44.366 --> 05:47.433
which alternated
nitrate-producing legumes...

05:47.466 --> 05:49.066
Dexter, thinking:
Legumes...

05:49.100 --> 05:52.150
[Class giggling]

05:52.183 --> 05:55.050
Such as peanuts--

05:55.316 --> 05:56.233
with cotton...

05:56.266 --> 05:58.050
Dexter, thinking:
With cotton.

05:58.083 --> 06:01.116
[Class giggling]

06:01.150 --> 06:02.433
...which depletes soil
of its nutrients.

06:02.466 --> 06:05.283
Dexter: Which depletes soil
of its nutrients.

06:05.316 --> 06:09.150
[Voices overlapping]
Southern farmers soon began
planting peanuts one year

06:09.183 --> 06:10.466
and cotton the next.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.333
Mr. Muzinsky: And if Dexter
doesn't stop mimicking me,

06:13.366 --> 06:15.283
he'll be going
to the counselor's office

06:15.316 --> 06:17.116
after lunch.

06:17.150 --> 06:23.350
Dexter, thinking: He'll
be going to the counselor's
office after lunch.

06:26.450 --> 06:28.183
Dexter, thinking:
The day is almost over.

06:28.216 --> 06:33.233
All I have to do
is get through lunch
and the counselor's office,

06:33.266 --> 06:34.400
and I'll be ok.

06:34.433 --> 06:39.083
In fact, all this excitement
has made me quite famished.

06:39.116 --> 06:40.316
Woman: Hey! Hey, kid!

06:40.350 --> 06:41.450
Dexter: Huh?

06:41.483 --> 06:42.466
Yes?

06:43.000 --> 06:43.383
Aah!

06:43.416 --> 06:46.366
I said,
do you want gravy

06:46.400 --> 06:48.483
with your
meatloaf surprise?

06:49.016 --> 06:50.316
Dexter, thinking:
Holy moly!

06:50.350 --> 06:51.233
Huh?

06:51.266 --> 06:53.100
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll have--

06:53.133 --> 06:54.333
[thinking]
Mole!

06:54.366 --> 06:55.416
I was just trying to--

06:55.450 --> 06:56.383
[thinking]
Mole!

06:56.416 --> 06:57.383
Dexter: I didn't mean--

06:57.416 --> 06:59.050
[thinking]
Hairy mole!

06:59.083 --> 07:01.016
I don't know
what I'm saying.

07:01.050 --> 07:03.400
[Thinking]
Mole!

07:03.433 --> 07:04.450
Anything else?

07:04.483 --> 07:07.283
No, mole--
I mean, ma'am.

07:07.316 --> 07:11.100
[Thinking]
How am I going to
get through this?

07:11.133 --> 07:13.316
The counselor will hear
my every thought.

07:13.350 --> 07:19.150
Not...unless she hears
my every word.

07:19.183 --> 07:23.133
I do not call myself
"boy genius" for nothing.

07:23.166 --> 07:25.300
Dexter? I'm ready
to see you now.

07:25.333 --> 07:28.000
Mrs. Morris,
so nice to see you.

07:28.033 --> 07:29.466
It's been a while,
hasn't it?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.200
I am terribly sorry
about what happened.

07:32.233 --> 07:34.200
I don't know what
got into me today.

07:34.233 --> 07:38.100
I think I'm having
quite a bit of
stress, actually--

07:38.133 --> 07:40.216
the harsh reality
of life

07:40.250 --> 07:42.416
battling my inner
ideal instincts,

07:42.450 --> 07:44.150
my need to succeed
and excel

07:44.183 --> 07:46.183
at everything
precious to me.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.183
I feel it slipping

07:47.216 --> 07:49.433
through my delicate
little fingers.

07:49.466 --> 07:52.016
Maybe I'm lost
in my search

07:52.050 --> 07:53.450
for my own identity.

07:53.483 --> 07:55.133
You can
understand that,

07:55.166 --> 07:57.300
can't you,
Mrs. Morris?

07:57.333 --> 08:00.366
Well, of course
I can, Dexter.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.083
Good. Well,
I must be going,

08:02.116 --> 08:05.183
and thank you
so very much for this
insightful discussion.

08:05.216 --> 08:08.400
You have given me
quite a lot
to think about.

08:08.433 --> 08:10.033
Oh, Dexter?

08:10.066 --> 08:10.433
Yes?

08:10.466 --> 08:12.150
Keep in touch,
won't you?

08:12.183 --> 08:14.366
Well, of course,
I will...

08:14.400 --> 08:16.450
[Thinking]
Sucker.

08:16.483 --> 08:20.200
[Whimpering]

08:20.233 --> 08:24.450
Dexter: It is not fair.
Nothing is coming out
right.

08:24.483 --> 08:28.250
Why does everything
have to be so hard?

08:28.283 --> 08:31.233
This whole thing stinks.

08:32.233 --> 08:33.266
I have had enough!

08:33.300 --> 08:37.016
I must reverse this
at once.

08:39.400 --> 08:46.233
I think my cerebellic transverse
wave inducer is a success...

08:46.266 --> 08:48.250
At last.

08:49.133 --> 08:50.350
Dad?

08:51.416 --> 08:53.000
Yes, Dexter?

08:53.033 --> 08:56.150
What did you get me
for my birthday?

08:56.183 --> 08:59.416
Dexter, how many times
are you going to ask?

08:59.450 --> 09:01.333
I'm not telling you...

09:01.366 --> 09:05.350
[Thinking]
That I got you some
amazing, one-of-a-kind

09:05.383 --> 09:09.016
multi-functional socks--

09:09.050 --> 09:10.433
all wool, soft to the touch,

09:10.466 --> 09:13.100
yet breathable and supple.
Fully lined...

09:13.133 --> 09:19.000
Man, I went through
all of that just for
a pair of stupid socks?

09:19.033 --> 09:23.000
I know, I know.
You don't have to tell me.

09:37.300 --> 09:38.333
[Yawns]

09:38.366 --> 09:44.016
Another day, another
giant leap for mankind.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.050
Good night, monkey.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.216
Be a good monkey

09:48.250 --> 09:51.050
and watch over the lab
while I sleep.

09:51.083 --> 09:53.300
[Monkey chattering]

10:48.050 --> 10:50.300
[Screeches]

10:50.333 --> 10:53.000
[Quacks]

11:17.050 --> 11:19.433
[Cackles]

12:11.300 --> 12:13.383
I know my duck
is here, Dexter.

12:13.416 --> 12:14.450
Now give it back!

12:15.000 --> 12:18.216
I do not have
your stupid duck,
mandark,

12:18.250 --> 12:21.000
and I'll prove--

12:23.316 --> 12:25.000
aah!

12:25.033 --> 12:27.100
Aah.

12:27.133 --> 12:29.366
Ohh.

12:39.066 --> 12:41.183
[Gibberish]

13:03.116 --> 13:04.466
[Honk honk]

13:05.000 --> 13:06.050
Mom!

13:06.083 --> 13:07.266
Mom!

13:07.300 --> 13:09.100
Hi, kids.

13:09.133 --> 13:10.133
Mom!

13:10.166 --> 13:11.116
Mom!

13:11.150 --> 13:12.066
Mommy!

13:12.100 --> 13:13.100
You're home!

13:13.133 --> 13:14.183
Hi, Dex.

13:14.216 --> 13:16.133
How was your day, kids?

13:16.166 --> 13:18.433
Oh, mom.
It was fantastic.

13:18.466 --> 13:20.250
Yeah,
it was cool.

13:20.283 --> 13:21.400
How cool?

13:21.433 --> 13:22.483
Real cool!

13:23.016 --> 13:23.383
Really?

13:23.416 --> 13:26.233
Yeah. Yeah.
It was cool.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.316
Such an insignificant
and putrid waste

13:32.350 --> 13:33.383
of the human race.

13:33.416 --> 13:35.366
He offers no benefit
to society,

13:35.400 --> 13:36.433
no improvement
to culture,

13:36.466 --> 13:39.483
no magnanimity
to the integrity of boyhood--

13:40.016 --> 13:40.466
a despicable character,

13:41.000 --> 13:42.483
self-seeking
at anyone's expense--

13:43.016 --> 13:46.350
if you will, a rat
in the sewer of life.

13:46.383 --> 13:48.133
Dexter...

13:48.166 --> 13:51.000
Also known as "stupid
stinky doodyhead!"

13:51.033 --> 13:53.466
I hate Dexter!
I hate Dexter!

13:54.000 --> 13:55.016
I must defeat him.

13:55.050 --> 13:57.000
I must destroy his lab,
but how?

13:57.033 --> 14:00.016
Dexter may be small, puny,
even sickly at times,

14:00.050 --> 14:02.066
but his brain
defies its size.

14:02.100 --> 14:03.366
I must infiltrate
Dexter's home,

14:03.400 --> 14:05.416
learn his weaknesses,
prey on his flaws,

14:05.450 --> 14:07.166
and most importantly,

14:07.200 --> 14:10.133
put an end
to his scientific career
and laboratory for all time!

14:10.166 --> 14:11.133
But how?

14:11.166 --> 14:12.133
How can I get
close enough to Dexter

14:12.166 --> 14:14.183
without revealing
my true identity?

14:14.216 --> 14:15.283
Be right back, kids.

14:15.316 --> 14:18.450
Left a bag in the car.

14:19.316 --> 14:21.450
Oh! Would you look at that?

14:21.483 --> 14:23.183
Darn.

14:23.216 --> 14:25.450
Come here, little tomato.

14:36.100 --> 14:38.133
Mandark: With Dexter's mother
cryogenically captured

14:38.166 --> 14:39.200
in suspended animation,

14:39.233 --> 14:41.416
followed by an obligatory
suit-up sequence,

14:41.450 --> 14:42.350
I can become--

14:42.383 --> 14:45.483
momdark! Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

14:46.016 --> 14:47.300
Ha ha ha!

15:02.416 --> 15:05.016
It's bedtime, Dexter...

15:05.050 --> 15:07.116
Permanently!

15:13.016 --> 15:14.233
Oh, hello.

15:14.266 --> 15:15.183
Ahem.

15:15.216 --> 15:16.216
Hello, kids.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.216
Hi, mom!

15:17.250 --> 15:19.300
Hi, mom!

15:20.133 --> 15:21.483
Well, I guess
I'll, uh,

15:22.016 --> 15:24.033
be upstairs.

15:24.350 --> 15:25.350
This is too easy.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.350
I should have thought
of this years ago.

15:27.383 --> 15:30.383
And now to destroy.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.266
Hee hee hee!

15:42.100 --> 15:45.083
The moment I've been
waiting for.

15:46.416 --> 15:49.116
Dad: Honey, I'm home!

15:49.150 --> 15:50.383
Where are you?

15:50.416 --> 15:52.183
Uh, coming.

15:52.216 --> 15:53.383
Drat!

15:53.416 --> 15:55.350
Dad: Ha ha ha!

15:55.383 --> 15:57.266
Oh, that's great, Dex.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.383
You're a cool
young dude.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.350
Yoo-hoo,
honeycakes!

16:01.383 --> 16:02.383
Uh, mom here.

16:02.416 --> 16:05.133
Uh, um, how--
how was your day?

16:05.166 --> 16:06.216
Very exciting?

16:06.250 --> 16:08.350
Hey, how about a hug
for your overworked hubby?

16:08.383 --> 16:13.133
Ooh. Working out again,
sweet cheeks?

16:15.033 --> 16:16.100
Ow!

16:16.133 --> 16:18.333
Oh, honey,
was that your foot?
I'm so sorry.

16:21.050 --> 16:22.466
Gee, dad.
Are you ok?

16:23.000 --> 16:23.433
Ha ha!

16:23.466 --> 16:26.133
Yeah, but all this
jumping around

16:26.166 --> 16:29.183
sure has made me
hungry.

16:29.216 --> 16:30.183
Out!

16:30.216 --> 16:31.066
Huh?

16:31.100 --> 16:32.150
I have
to cook dinner.

16:32.183 --> 16:33.183
Now out, out,
out, out, out,
out, out, out.

16:33.216 --> 16:34.083
Dad: But--

16:34.116 --> 16:35.033
Dee Dee:
Uh, but--

16:35.066 --> 16:36.150
out, out, out,
out, out!

16:36.183 --> 16:37.083
[Door closes]

16:37.116 --> 16:39.250
Uh, your mother needs

16:39.283 --> 16:41.333
a little personal time.

16:41.366 --> 16:43.383
[Teeth chattering]

16:47.450 --> 16:50.266
What?

16:51.016 --> 16:52.000
<i>Voilà!</i>

16:52.033 --> 16:53.250
Dee Dee:
Wow, mom!

16:53.283 --> 16:55.000
Dexter: Cool!

16:55.033 --> 16:57.050
Clever and fun,
dear.

16:57.083 --> 16:59.200
You should really
do this more often.

16:59.233 --> 17:01.300
[Chewing loudly]

17:01.333 --> 17:03.416
Mmm.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.200
[Chewing loudly]

17:09.233 --> 17:12.050
[Chewing loudly]

17:18.416 --> 17:21.300
Dad: Uh, honey?

17:21.333 --> 17:22.400
Yes, dear?

17:22.433 --> 17:24.050
How about
some popcorn here?

17:24.083 --> 17:26.016
The show's
about to start.

17:26.050 --> 17:27.100
Of course, dear.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.483
[Television playing]

17:30.016 --> 17:31.033
[Timer dings]

17:31.066 --> 17:32.000
Popcorn.

17:32.033 --> 17:33.000
Thanks, mom.

17:33.033 --> 17:34.316
Thanks, mom.

17:38.050 --> 17:39.150
Mom?

17:39.183 --> 17:40.350
Yes, Dexter?

17:40.383 --> 17:43.133
You forgot the butter.

17:43.416 --> 17:47.100
Of course, Dexter.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.416
[Stomping]

17:52.050 --> 17:54.450
Thanks, mom.

17:54.483 --> 17:55.366
Mom?

17:55.400 --> 17:56.383
Yes, Dee Dee?

17:56.416 --> 17:57.400
I'm thirsty.

17:57.433 --> 17:59.350
Of course, Dee Dee.

17:59.383 --> 18:00.316
Mandark: Oh,
this is too--

18:00.350 --> 18:02.233
I'm gonna--
this has gone too--

18:02.266 --> 18:04.350
ooh, I can't
believe it.

18:04.383 --> 18:06.183
Mom!

18:07.133 --> 18:09.166
Mom!

18:09.200 --> 18:10.333
Honey!

18:10.366 --> 18:11.300
Yuck!

18:11.333 --> 18:13.100
Mom!
Mom!

18:13.133 --> 18:15.000

18:28.416 --> 18:29.316
Mom!

18:29.350 --> 18:30.300
What?

18:30.333 --> 18:33.466
It's time
for my good night kiss.

18:35.050 --> 18:35.466
No.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.033
[Thinking]
A terrible dilemma.

18:37.066 --> 18:38.133
What am I to do?

18:38.166 --> 18:40.100
If I don't acknowledge
Dexter's maternal request,

18:40.133 --> 18:41.383
Dexter will suspect
something.

18:41.416 --> 18:42.433
The show will be over.

18:42.466 --> 18:44.100
My secret will be revealed,

18:44.133 --> 18:45.316
everything I've worked for.

18:45.350 --> 18:46.450
But Dexter's germs--

18:46.483 --> 18:49.366
I can feel the bacteria
crawling inside me already.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.266
But I've come so close.

18:51.300 --> 18:52.450
I must--

18:52.483 --> 18:54.266
[spitting]

18:54.300 --> 18:55.350
Disgusting.

18:55.383 --> 18:58.216
But if Dexter
wants a kiss, then--

18:58.250 --> 18:59.283
Dee Dee: Mom!

18:59.316 --> 19:00.266
Dee Dee!

19:00.300 --> 19:03.183
Kiss Mary Beth.

19:03.366 --> 19:04.233
Drat.

19:04.266 --> 19:05.316
Now that everyone's asleep,

19:05.350 --> 19:07.183
I can finally unleash
the evil I have planned

19:07.216 --> 19:10.000
for Dexter's lab!

19:10.033 --> 19:12.483
Dad: Oh, honey!

19:14.083 --> 19:16.200
Uh, you called, dear?

19:16.233 --> 19:20.183
You coming to bed,
dear?

19:22.000 --> 19:24.250
Uh, uh, I think
my roast is burning.

19:24.283 --> 19:27.116
I'll just
sleep downstairs.

19:27.150 --> 19:28.100
Dad: Aw, come on.

19:28.133 --> 19:30.133
That's what you
always say!

19:30.166 --> 19:32.033
I can't go up there now.

19:32.066 --> 19:37.200
I'll just have to rest here
until tomorrow.

19:39.233 --> 19:40.200
Dexter: Mom!

19:40.233 --> 19:41.183
Dad: Honey!

Dexter's laboratory!

20:01.166 --> 20:02.366
Ha ha ha!

20:02.400 --> 20:03.333
Ha ha ha!

20:03.366 --> 20:05.050
Ha ha--oh. Ow.

20:05.083 --> 20:06.333
Oh, oh, no.

20:06.366 --> 20:08.066
Too tired to destroy.

20:08.100 --> 20:09.466
Going to lay down
for a while,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.183
then come back.

20:12.216 --> 20:15.066
[Television playing]

20:19.283 --> 20:21.083
Uh, honey?

20:21.116 --> 20:22.100
Yes, dear.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.466
You missed a spot.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.250
[Echoing]
Missed a spot.

20:25.283 --> 20:26.250
Missed a spot.

20:26.283 --> 20:28.000
Missed a spot.

20:28.033 --> 20:29.250

20:29.283 --> 20:31.000
Missed a spot.

20:31.033 --> 20:32.250

20:32.283 --> 20:34.333
Missed a spot.

20:35.333 --> 20:38.366
[Yelling]

20:38.400 --> 20:42.000
Now where's that spot?

20:42.033 --> 20:42.383
Dad: Hey!

20:42.416 --> 20:44.000
There are
two moms...

20:44.033 --> 20:45.016
But which one's real?

20:45.050 --> 20:47.116
Mom tied
my ballet shoes
real good.

20:47.150 --> 20:50.116
Yeah, but I didn't get
a bedtime story.

20:50.150 --> 20:52.066
My shirts were
pressed to perfection

20:52.100 --> 20:53.283
like mother
always does,

20:53.316 --> 20:57.300
but that massage
was unusually relaxing.

20:57.333 --> 21:00.400
Oh, well. I guess
we'll just have
to have two mother--

21:00.433 --> 21:02.166
oh, shut up, will you?

21:02.200 --> 21:03.433
You want to know
who the real mom is?

21:03.466 --> 21:05.100
She is!

21:05.133 --> 21:06.433
I don't even know
how she puts up
with all you jerks

21:06.466 --> 21:07.366
with your whining--

21:07.400 --> 21:09.083
"mommy this,"
"mommy that,"

21:09.116 --> 21:10.100
"honey, I need this,"

21:10.133 --> 21:11.000
"mommy, wipe that."

21:11.033 --> 21:12.083
You ruined
my whole plan

21:12.116 --> 21:13.350
with your griping,
complaining,
and fussing.

21:13.383 --> 21:15.083
You're all a bunch
of selfish creeps.

21:15.116 --> 21:17.350
I don't even want
to destroy your lab
anymore, Dexter.

21:17.383 --> 21:20.316
I just want to get
the heck out of here!

21:20.350 --> 21:21.400
Huh. What
did he mean

21:21.433 --> 21:24.400
when he said
"your lab,"
Dexter?

21:24.433 --> 21:27.150
I don't know.
