00:04.838 --> 00:06.596
Abbey.

00:06.648 --> 00:08.963
- What's she doing here?
- She's on community service.

00:08.964 --> 00:11.523
I don't know who I am!

00:11.524 --> 00:14.323
When the storm happened,
I lost my memory.

00:14.548 --> 00:15.827
Forgot everything.

00:15.828 --> 00:18.667
So is that it, then?
You and Alex, you... you're together?

00:18.668 --> 00:20.227
Boyfriend and girlfriend.

00:20.228 --> 00:21.267
Yeah, Finn.

00:21.268 --> 00:23.787
Alex? The sexy barman?

00:23.788 --> 00:25.227
He's got no dick.

00:25.228 --> 00:27.387
This is the greatest day of me life!

00:27.388 --> 00:28.867
What's her name?

00:28.868 --> 00:30.707
She calls herself James.

00:30.708 --> 00:34.147
Get your dick out right now!

00:34.148 --> 00:36.187
That's mine!

00:42.348 --> 00:44.107
Um... Oh, my G...

00:44.108 --> 00:45.227
I came to see you.

00:45.228 --> 00:47.547
I'm not the caretaker.

00:47.548 --> 00:51.107
It's not for me to judge you.

00:51.108 --> 00:51.787
I've got to go.

00:51.788 --> 00:53.227
Oh, no, no, don't.

00:53.228 --> 00:54.327
Please don't go.

00:54.343 --> 00:55.022
How did it go?

00:55.023 --> 00:56.702
It was amazing, and then she's...

00:56.954 --> 00:58.393
Well, she's ran away!

00:58.415 --> 01:01.854
She left her bag.

01:01.855 --> 01:05.854
Oh... Shit, I'm in love
with a fucking nun.

01:41.177 --> 01:43.056
There's a young man here to see you.

01:43.057 --> 01:47.056
He says he has your bag.

01:52.817 --> 01:54.296
You can send him in.

01:54.297 --> 01:58.296
Be careful, Nadine.

02:05.217 --> 02:08.015
Shit.

02:08.114 --> 02:09.233
Sound Of Music.

02:09.234 --> 02:10.393
What about it?

02:10.394 --> 02:12.153
It had a nun in it.

02:12.154 --> 02:13.753
And it was a great film, weren't it?

02:15.474 --> 02:17.633
Happy... Happy Feet. Happy F...

02:17.634 --> 02:19.393
Penguins! Ha-ha!

02:19.394 --> 02:20.993
It had penguins in it.

02:20.994 --> 02:22.833
I'm getting... I'm an idiot.

02:22.834 --> 02:24.873
Nadine will see you now.

02:24.874 --> 02:27.273
Penguins.

02:27.274 --> 02:30.553
Are they birds or are they fish?

02:30.554 --> 02:33.513
Does it really matter anyway?
We're all God's creatures.

02:33.514 --> 02:36.513
So...

02:36.514 --> 02:38.553
All right.

02:38.554 --> 02:39.793
Brrr!

02:41.234 --> 02:44.513
Happy Feet, innit?

02:44.514 --> 02:46.473
It's not funny.

02:46.474 --> 02:49.353
It's just an 'abit.
Habit! Cos you...

02:49.354 --> 02:51.193
No?

02:51.194 --> 02:55.113
Ohh.

03:01.714 --> 03:03.473
So,

03:03.474 --> 03:05.193
as it turns out,

03:05.194 --> 03:06.673
you're a nun.

03:06.674 --> 03:08.673
A... A nun.

03:08.674 --> 03:11.033
I'd have never seen that comin'.

03:11.034 --> 03:13.393
I wanted to tell you.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.993
I didn't know what to do.

03:14.994 --> 03:17.433
Yeah, you and this nun thing...

03:17.434 --> 03:20.273
What does that mean...
for me and you,

03:20.274 --> 03:22.553
and... us and our thing?

03:22.554 --> 03:23.673
I mean, is there even a thing or...

03:23.674 --> 03:25.673
I've given myself to Jesus.

03:25.674 --> 03:27.233
Y-Yeah.

03:27.234 --> 03:30.193
But... you know,
you and the Jesus fella,

03:30.194 --> 03:33.153
is that exclusive, really, cos I'd
settle for being your booty call!

03:33.154 --> 03:36.153
I can't see you again.

03:36.154 --> 03:37.793
I'm sorry.

03:37.794 --> 03:40.433
It's... It's all right. So...

03:40.434 --> 03:42.273
I understand that's a good decision.

03:42.274 --> 03:43.713
I never meant for this to happen.

03:43.714 --> 03:45.593
It's all right.

03:45.594 --> 03:47.593
It's fine. It's Jesus.

03:49.434 --> 03:51.393
He's the Son of God.

03:51.394 --> 03:54.593
I'm just a dickhead.

03:54.594 --> 03:58.073
Wi' a big mouth. And a bag,
which is yours. You left it.

03:58.074 --> 04:02.073
I'll just...
I'll pop it up here, eh?

04:03.794 --> 04:05.913
She's all yours.

04:05.914 --> 04:07.353
Just be nice.

04:07.354 --> 04:10.513
She's special, this one.

04:10.514 --> 04:11.473
Rudy.

04:11.474 --> 04:15.473
They should call it Sad Feet.

04:36.074 --> 04:37.993
You must never see him again.

04:37.994 --> 04:41.993
It's too dangerous.

04:45.859 --> 04:53.859
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

05:27.994 --> 05:29.993
I think it's bigger.

05:29.994 --> 05:33.033
Like maybe the whole...
swapping thing... stretched it.

05:33.034 --> 05:37.033
Well, I'll leave you two
to get reacquainted.

05:39.314 --> 05:42.553
You probably have a lot to talk about.

05:42.554 --> 05:46.553
It's definitely longer.

05:52.034 --> 05:55.953
The Lord... giveth...

05:55.954 --> 05:57.673
and your boy takes awayeth.

05:57.674 --> 06:01.673
Sometimes the... taking away
feels a little bit...

06:02.434 --> 06:05.513
more than the giving, but...

06:05.514 --> 06:06.473
What you doing?

06:06.474 --> 06:07.793
I am praying, dude.

06:07.794 --> 06:11.793
I'm praying... to the Lord Jesus
Christ, in the heavens above,

06:11.954 --> 06:14.593
that Nadine stops being a frigging nun,

06:14.594 --> 06:17.793
so I can... express
my physical love for her in a...

06:17.794 --> 06:21.113
beautiful... union
of our two genitals.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.433
Amen.

06:22.434 --> 06:24.513
And God's taking
these kind of requests, is he?

06:24.514 --> 06:27.033
If he can build Noah
a massive friggin' ark,

06:27.034 --> 06:29.713
he can spare a nun for old Rudy,
can't he? You know what I mean?

06:29.714 --> 06:32.233
I'm not being funny, but you
and a nun is not something...

06:32.234 --> 06:33.713
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:33.714 --> 06:35.913
Do not say whatever it is
you're about to say.

06:35.914 --> 06:37.073
What are you saying?

06:37.074 --> 06:38.873
I'm not sayin' anything.
Well, don't say.

06:38.874 --> 06:40.393
I'm not.
Well, that's good.

06:40.394 --> 06:44.393
Cos in the Bible it says,
"Judge not what a man hath done,

06:44.594 --> 06:46.353
"but judge what he could have done

06:46.354 --> 06:49.913
"if he was a different bloke
altogether.

06:49.914 --> 06:53.033
"For art thou a leper...

06:53.034 --> 06:56.273
"..and a leper can changeth
his spots, Finn."

06:56.274 --> 06:58.113
I'm pretty sure it's "leopard".

06:58.114 --> 06:59.993
That's the same difference.

06:59.994 --> 07:01.033
No, it isn't.

07:01.034 --> 07:03.153
It... It is.

07:03.154 --> 07:05.993
Anyway, it's all piss
under the bridge, dude,

07:05.994 --> 07:09.593
cos I am going to go and confess
all my sins, be absolved

07:09.594 --> 07:13.073
for all responsibility
of anything... ever.

07:13.074 --> 07:14.553
What a sweet deal.

07:14.554 --> 07:16.153
Innit?

07:16.154 --> 07:20.153
So when are you doing this, then,
this... confessin'?

07:20.394 --> 07:24.393
Lunchtime.

07:38.514 --> 07:41.033
What's this?!

07:41.034 --> 07:43.233
What's with the strange,
lingering silence?

07:43.234 --> 07:45.593
Where's your comic banter?

07:45.594 --> 07:48.953
And witty repartee,
the... rebellious backchat?

07:48.954 --> 07:50.793
What the fuck is up wi' you lot?

07:50.794 --> 07:53.473
Well, she's thinking about
her incredibly hot boyfriend

07:53.474 --> 07:55.153
and his new cock.

07:55.154 --> 07:56.593
Fuck you!

07:56.594 --> 07:57.873
He's obsessing over her,

07:57.874 --> 07:59.993
even though she doesn't think of him
like that and will never shag him.

07:59.994 --> 08:01.433
Well...

08:01.434 --> 08:02.873
Let her... speak for herself,

08:02.874 --> 08:06.193
shall we, Jess?

08:06.194 --> 08:08.513
And him...

08:08.514 --> 08:09.793
He's in love with a nun.

08:09.794 --> 08:11.633
I am, man, I'm in love with a nun!

08:11.634 --> 08:13.273
Which is always going to end up badly.

08:13.274 --> 08:14.473
Oi... no!

08:14.474 --> 08:17.673
Why do you have to say
something like that? Eh?

08:17.674 --> 08:21.233
What about you, sweetcheeks?

08:21.234 --> 08:24.633
I'm still looking for
some kind of emotional connection.

08:24.634 --> 08:26.673
I'm starting to think
I'm never going to find it.

08:26.674 --> 08:29.113
Which makes me feel sad and...

08:29.114 --> 08:33.113
lost and strangely horny,
like I want to fuck away the pain.

08:33.193 --> 08:36.193
You take the pain...

08:36.193 --> 08:39.033
and you hang onto it.

08:39.034 --> 08:40.553
You bury it!

08:40.554 --> 08:42.753
Deep inside you.

08:42.754 --> 08:45.273
Do you feel it?

08:45.274 --> 08:47.033
Do you feel it?

08:47.034 --> 08:50.993
Cos that's it.

08:50.994 --> 08:54.993
Feels like your guts
are strangling your heart.

08:56.114 --> 08:58.953
Lap it up.

08:58.954 --> 09:02.953
It's good for the soul.

09:11.034 --> 09:14.753
Why are you looking at him like that?

09:14.754 --> 09:17.073
It's like a weight's been lifted.

09:17.074 --> 09:19.193
Or reattached.

09:19.194 --> 09:20.873
I'm talkin' about his cock.

09:20.874 --> 09:22.673
Why are you all so obsessed
with his cock?

09:22.674 --> 09:24.313
I wouldn't say I'm obsessed.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.633
If you're really that into it,

09:25.634 --> 09:29.633
why don't you go over there
and ask him to show it to you?

09:31.594 --> 09:33.033
Cos he's workin'.

09:33.034 --> 09:35.713
And there's probably... a health
and safety thing

09:35.714 --> 09:38.393
about cocks and alcoholic drinks.

09:38.394 --> 09:40.233
Well, there should be.

09:40.234 --> 09:41.393
Look at her.

09:41.394 --> 09:44.633
This whole "search for
a bullshit connection" thing,

09:44.634 --> 09:46.393
it's an excuse to be an enormous slut.

09:46.394 --> 09:47.953
I like her.

09:47.954 --> 09:49.153
Do you fancy her?

09:49.154 --> 09:50.353
Why do you care?

09:50.354 --> 09:52.113
I don't.

09:52.114 --> 09:56.113
All right, well, that's...
all worked out very nicely, hmm?

09:56.314 --> 09:57.833
And...

09:57.834 --> 10:01.833
I have things to do and places
to be, so I'll see you tomorrow.

10:05.514 --> 10:06.793
Hard job.

10:08.034 --> 10:09.393
OK...

10:09.394 --> 10:11.593
I'll see you later.

10:11.594 --> 10:13.553
She seems nice.

10:13.554 --> 10:15.073
She's a friend.

10:15.074 --> 10:19.073
Is she? I'm sure you're very
friendly with all the ladies.

10:19.794 --> 10:21.473
Do yourself a favour.

10:21.474 --> 10:24.393
Mind your own fuckin' business.

10:24.394 --> 10:26.193
Maybe I'll make it my business.

10:26.194 --> 10:28.113
Maybe...

10:28.114 --> 10:32.113
I should go into the business
of making your business...

10:33.594 --> 10:36.393
my business, and...

10:36.394 --> 10:40.393
and then we'll see
whose b... business it is.

10:41.914 --> 10:45.913
Pfff.

11:31.954 --> 11:35.953
Nadine?

11:57.194 --> 11:59.862
It's Nadine. She's gone.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.375
Hail Mary, full of grace.
Hail Mary, full of grace.

12:05.376 --> 12:08.095
Hail Mary, full of grace.
Hail Mary, full of grace.

12:08.966 --> 12:10.165
Hail Mary, full of grace.

12:10.166 --> 12:10.825
Hail Mary, full...

12:10.871 --> 12:13.790
Oi! Should be helping me out
with some of these.

12:13.791 --> 12:15.350
Some of these Hail Marys are yours.

12:15.351 --> 12:17.910
Why? Why would I need
to repent for your sins?

12:17.911 --> 12:19.230
Because, dude, you're a twat!

12:19.231 --> 12:21.430
A miserable twat,
and that's the most terrible sin.

12:21.431 --> 12:24.150
Do you know, honestly...
Do you honestly believe

12:24.151 --> 12:26.390
that God will let you
have a relationship with Nadine

12:26.391 --> 12:28.390
because you've said 50,000 Hail Marys?

12:28.391 --> 12:32.390
The priest said that I have
to repent to be forgiven.

12:32.551 --> 12:34.270
He said you were going to burn in hell.

12:34.271 --> 12:37.630
And I chose to ignore that. I'll
tell you something right now, fella.

12:37.631 --> 12:40.470
Would it kill you to have a little
friggin' Christian compassion?

12:40.471 --> 12:41.630
You fucking dick!

12:41.631 --> 12:43.990
You know, I-I-I cannot
get her out of me mind.

12:43.991 --> 12:46.670
It's like the friggin' birds
are singing her name in the trees.

12:46.850 --> 12:47.929
Nadine!

12:47.942 --> 12:48.981
All right.

12:48.982 --> 12:50.261
Nadine.
That's enough.

12:50.262 --> 12:51.421
Fuck, it's torture.

12:51.422 --> 12:53.621
Come on, let's just do it.
Let's get it out the way.

12:53.622 --> 12:56.621
Only 25,000 Hail Marys each.
Oh, ridiculous.

12:56.622 --> 12:58.821
Hail Mary, full of grace.
Hail Mary, full of grace.

12:58.822 --> 13:01.341
Hail Mary, full of grace.
Hail Mary, full of grace.

13:01.342 --> 13:03.501
Hail Mary, full of grace.
Hail Mary, full of grace.

13:03.502 --> 13:06.581
Rudy.

13:06.582 --> 13:08.061
Rudy?

13:08.062 --> 13:09.581
Hail Marying worked.

13:09.582 --> 13:11.741
There is a friggin' God.
See it up top there.

13:11.742 --> 13:13.341
Just... whatever.

13:13.342 --> 13:14.821
How's me hair? Is it all right?

13:14.822 --> 13:17.781
Just get off.. No, get off,
it's fine. Get in here, come on.

13:17.782 --> 13:19.541
She doesn't need
to see this freak show.

13:19.542 --> 13:20.941
You were going to be honest.

13:20.942 --> 13:22.501
Define "honest".

13:22.502 --> 13:23.941
Telling the truth.

13:23.942 --> 13:25.341
Ohh... D'you know what?

13:25.342 --> 13:28.381
Some people might find your naivety
really charming, but I don't.

13:28.382 --> 13:32.381
I do not, not at all. Get in!

13:35.782 --> 13:37.341
Hi.

13:37.342 --> 13:39.941
Hi.

13:39.942 --> 13:40.981
Hi.

13:40.982 --> 13:43.821
Hi.

13:43.822 --> 13:47.821
Hi.

13:48.862 --> 13:52.261
Do you want to hear a joke?
Yeah.

13:52.262 --> 13:55.301
What's black and white
and red all over?

13:55.302 --> 13:56.621
Nun in a blender.

13:57.782 --> 14:01.781
All right, what's black and white,
black and white, and then red?

14:02.582 --> 14:04.141
Nun killing a penguin.

14:04.142 --> 14:07.221
Whay! Respect, mate,
you know your nun jokes.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.381
All right, what black and white
and smells musty?

14:09.382 --> 14:10.541
A nun's cu...

14:10.542 --> 14:11.981
Ahh. Shit.

14:11.982 --> 14:13.061
What?

14:13.062 --> 14:16.421
Aw, it doesn't matter. It's nothing.
I'm... It's...

14:16.422 --> 14:18.301
Nothing's... Nothing's musty.

14:18.302 --> 14:19.621
Why would it be musty?

14:19.622 --> 14:21.581
Um... Probably...

14:21.582 --> 14:23.261
underuse...

14:23.262 --> 14:26.741
or just a lack of air circulation...

14:26.742 --> 14:28.821
resulting in...

14:28.822 --> 14:30.141
general mustiness.

14:30.142 --> 14:33.221
Forgive me, Father, I have...
Love, I have sinned.

14:33.222 --> 14:35.381
I'm not a priest,
I can't hear your confession.

14:35.382 --> 14:37.101
No, you don't understand.
I... I've...

14:37.102 --> 14:39.701
I've done terrible, horrible,
vile things.

14:39.702 --> 14:42.901
I have had sexual relations
with women up the...

14:42.902 --> 14:44.821
What do your nuns called the arse?

14:44.822 --> 14:46.581
The a... Up the anus.
Rudy.

14:46.582 --> 14:49.901
I have had a... a diet of crisps
and sugary snacks.

14:49.902 --> 14:51.222
I think you can get a
pass for the crisps.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.541
No, you don't understand.

14:52.542 --> 14:55.141
I have inserted sugary snacks
into women.

14:55.142 --> 14:56.341
Don't.

14:56.342 --> 15:00.341
I have misused confectionery
in the most vile and vulgar manner.

15:00.942 --> 15:04.941
I have violated myself
with a fucking king-size...

15:07.502 --> 15:10.821
Mars bar.

15:10.822 --> 15:13.501
I don't care.

15:13.502 --> 15:17.501
I don't care what you've done
in your past.

15:18.182 --> 15:22.181
You've got a good heart.

15:37.942 --> 15:41.941
I promised myself to God.

15:43.022 --> 15:47.021
I was prepared
to dedicate my life to him.

15:48.182 --> 15:51.621
I see things.

15:51.622 --> 15:55.621
Violence and cruelty and suffering.

15:57.822 --> 16:01.381
Sometimes I question his existence.

16:01.382 --> 16:05.381
Then I met you.

16:05.862 --> 16:09.461
I've never felt like this.

16:09.462 --> 16:12.501
Doubted my faith even more.

16:12.502 --> 16:13.741
I'm not...

16:13.742 --> 16:17.741
I'm not asking you
to give up your faith or anything.

16:18.702 --> 16:22.701
I'll share you with God.

16:23.662 --> 16:26.981
He'll probably want you Sundays,
won't he?

16:26.982 --> 16:28.741
He does like his Sundays.

16:28.742 --> 16:31.181
Right, well,
then he can have you Sundays,

16:31.182 --> 16:34.581
I'll have you rest of t'week.

16:34.582 --> 16:36.181
How's that sound?

16:36.182 --> 16:40.181
How's that sitting with you, big fella?

16:41.942 --> 16:43.661
I think he's cool with it.

16:43.662 --> 16:44.581
That's settled, then.

16:47.582 --> 16:50.341
Forgive me,
I'm going to have to nip to the...

16:50.342 --> 16:52.341
What do... nuns call the toilet?

16:52.342 --> 16:53.541
They call it the toilet.

16:53.542 --> 16:55.341
Brilliant.

16:55.342 --> 16:57.541
- You can talk how you normally talk.
- Well...

16:57.542 --> 17:00.221
in that case, I'm going to go
for an enormous fucking shit.

17:00.222 --> 17:01.861
Let's stick to "toilet".

17:01.862 --> 17:03.421
All right, no, fair enough.

17:03.422 --> 17:07.421
I reckon I'm getting the hang
of this now.

17:08.541 --> 17:11.381
Oh!

17:25.462 --> 17:29.461
Rudy?

17:34.382 --> 17:38.381
Rudy?

17:44.422 --> 17:48.421
Rudy?

18:11.782 --> 18:15.061
Hiya. Um...

18:15.062 --> 18:19.061
It's... It's me, Rudy, Lord. I...

18:21.062 --> 18:22.821
I just want you to know

18:22.822 --> 18:26.821
that I'm going to take
good care of her and...

18:27.222 --> 18:31.221
God, I'll cherish the fuck out of her.

18:33.302 --> 18:36.581
For I am a sheep.

18:36.582 --> 18:39.261
And you're a shepherd. And...

18:39.262 --> 18:41.261
a sheep...

18:41.262 --> 18:45.261
always keeps his promises.

18:46.222 --> 18:50.221
So, amen.

18:50.942 --> 18:54.661
Oh, and if you could do anything
about me bowels an' all, please,

18:54.662 --> 18:58.661
that would be very much appreciated,
as I am shitting elephants.

18:59.262 --> 19:02.421
Amen. Fuck.

19:05.022 --> 19:08.581
I'll tell you...

19:08.582 --> 19:09.621
Nadine?

19:09.622 --> 19:11.021
Fuck.

19:11.022 --> 19:13.101
Nadi...?

19:13.102 --> 19:14.261
Have you seen my nun?

19:14.262 --> 19:16.981
No. Is she here?

19:16.982 --> 19:18.501
Please tell me you didn't...?

19:18.502 --> 19:20.022
You did, didn't you?

19:20.023 --> 19:21.541
No, I didn't do that,
because I'm a friggin' sheep,

19:21.542 --> 19:23.461
and she's fucking ran off again,
hasn't she?

19:23.462 --> 19:26.101
Honestly, man, I am not sure
how much more of this

19:26.102 --> 19:27.581
my fragile heart can take.

19:27.582 --> 19:29.301
Honestly... Have you done this?

19:29.302 --> 19:30.701
You've... You've done this.

19:30.702 --> 19:33.421
You've... You've built up my dreams
and y-y-you've crushed 'em.

19:33.422 --> 19:36.061
You're not a shepherd.
You're a friggin' penis, sir.

19:36.062 --> 19:37.381
You can't call God a penis.

19:37.382 --> 19:41.301
God... Shit! Fucking...

19:41.302 --> 19:42.581
That's my fucking TV!

19:42.582 --> 19:45.421
Well, we're going to have to put it
down to an act of God, Finlay.

19:45.422 --> 19:46.461
Shit!

19:46.462 --> 19:50.461
Cor, what a bell-end!

19:53.502 --> 19:57.501
Oh...

19:57.662 --> 20:01.661
D'you know, honestly, I have bailed
on more girls I care to remember.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.621
All becomes a bit of a blur, to be
honest, with all the soft hair,

20:04.622 --> 20:07.901
silky vaginae.
I've climbed out of windows,

20:07.902 --> 20:09.941
I've faked me own death.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.341
I've bailed mid-fuck.

20:11.342 --> 20:13.381
You've walked out on
someone mid-fuck?

20:13.382 --> 20:14.861
Yeah. Point being...

20:14.862 --> 20:15.781
So, there is a point?

20:15.782 --> 20:17.341
Yeah, there's a...

20:17.342 --> 20:18.661
Yes, there's a point.

20:18.662 --> 20:20.781
And the point is...

20:20.782 --> 20:23.941
and this is fucking heartbreaking -
there are shitters

20:23.942 --> 20:25.981
and there are people that get shat on.

20:25.982 --> 20:29.981
I'm a shitter and I've been shat on
from a bloody great height

20:30.702 --> 20:34.421
and it's killing me. Me heart's
in pieces all over the floor here.

20:34.422 --> 20:36.141
Yeah, along with me flat-screen TV.

20:36.142 --> 20:40.141
Ohhh! Will you shut up?

20:40.142 --> 20:42.421
And stop... Where are you going? Oi!

20:42.422 --> 20:44.581
Did we not agree that
that was an act of God?

20:44.582 --> 20:46.381
The TV?
We did not.

20:46.382 --> 20:48.461
Fuck's sake! Shut up.

20:48.462 --> 20:49.941
You've gotta fight for her.

20:49.942 --> 20:53.501
Yeah, cos you're such an
expert on relationships! "Hello!

20:53.502 --> 20:56.221
"Would you like to put your hand
down my knickers?"

20:56.222 --> 20:58.941
I know I'm searching for what he's got,

20:58.942 --> 21:01.461
and when I find it, I'd fight for it.

21:01.462 --> 21:04.741
I guess you're just not feeling
that with Alex. It's a shame.

21:04.742 --> 21:08.741
Really? Is that true?

21:09.422 --> 21:11.821
You are such a bitch.

21:11.822 --> 21:14.181
Did I say the wrong thing? Sorry.

21:14.182 --> 21:16.221
No, no, no. You're right.

21:16.222 --> 21:18.821
You are both right,
and you're friggin' strange.

21:18.822 --> 21:20.821
You have to fight for the nun you love.

21:20.822 --> 21:22.861
Fight for the nun you love.
That's it.

21:22.862 --> 21:25.061
Whoa!

21:25.062 --> 21:26.581
Where the fuck
do you think you're going?

21:26.582 --> 21:30.061
I've just... I'm...

21:30.062 --> 21:33.181
I'm-I'm going to see a nun to tell
her that I love her, actually.

21:33.182 --> 21:35.061
And you can't stop me, please, mate.

21:35.062 --> 21:37.741
What if I broke both your legs?

21:37.742 --> 21:38.861
Would that stop you?

21:38.862 --> 21:40.741
No, I'd crawl, man. I'd...

21:40.742 --> 21:44.741
Dude, I'd crawl through broken glass
and dog shit if I had to, I would.

21:46.822 --> 21:48.741
Hey.

21:48.742 --> 21:52.741
That's what love feels like.

21:54.222 --> 21:56.541
Crawling naked...

21:56.542 --> 21:59.141
through broken glass and dog shit.

21:59.142 --> 22:03.141
Naked?

22:03.862 --> 22:05.781
I should know.

22:05.782 --> 22:07.301
I was in love once.

22:07.302 --> 22:11.301
Didn't say anything, I was too scared.

22:13.782 --> 22:15.941
Lost them for ever.

22:15.942 --> 22:17.181
That's...

22:17.182 --> 22:20.541
That's a shame, man.
Feel your pain, man. That's horrid.

22:20.542 --> 22:23.741
You crawl...

22:23.742 --> 22:26.541
through the broken glass...

22:26.542 --> 22:28.701
and through the dog shit...

22:28.702 --> 22:30.861
and you fucking tell her
how much you love her,

22:30.862 --> 22:33.941
or so help me God,
I will fuck you to kingdom come.

22:33.942 --> 22:37.941
Oh! That's good stuff. Go on, then,
consider me motivated. I am...

22:38.622 --> 22:39.821
I am ready...

22:39.822 --> 22:41.141
to do this.

22:42.422 --> 22:44.781
Cor... Ohh...

22:44.782 --> 22:47.141
Oh!

22:47.142 --> 22:51.141
Squeeze past there, Greg.

22:53.262 --> 22:57.261
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah-oh.

23:25.062 --> 23:28.381
Um... Please, let me see her.
I just want to talk to her.

23:28.382 --> 23:29.762
She doesn't want to see you.

23:29.763 --> 23:31.141
I want to talk to her.
I want to see her.

23:31.142 --> 23:33.421
- You have to go. Go.
- Nadine!

23:33.422 --> 23:36.061
That is my foot!
You're being a really mean nun.

23:36.062 --> 23:38.541
You are a very mean nun. You... dick!

23:38.542 --> 23:41.421
Fucking nasty bastards. Shit!

23:41.422 --> 23:44.021
Oh, fuck.

23:44.022 --> 23:46.741
Nadine!

23:46.742 --> 23:47.941
Nadine!

23:47.942 --> 23:49.701
No, no, no, no, no, no. No!

23:49.702 --> 23:51.821
Oi! No, no!
Where are you taking her?

23:51.822 --> 23:54.821
Fucking nuns are full of shit!

23:54.822 --> 23:56.421
Nadine, I'm coming for you.

23:56.422 --> 23:58.741
Nadine!

23:58.742 --> 24:00.381
Nadine!

24:00.382 --> 24:03.301
Nadine, I'm coming for you.

24:03.302 --> 24:05.781
You can't stop us being together,
you know.

24:05.782 --> 24:09.781
I'm going to c... Fuck.

24:13.342 --> 24:14.868
Ohh!

24:26.296 --> 24:29.075
They're evil bitch nuns,
is what they are.

24:29.158 --> 24:33.157
Eh? They're holding Nadine hostage
because they're jealous of our love.

24:33.718 --> 24:37.677
It's like, if they can't have Rudy,
no-one can. Eh?

24:37.678 --> 24:39.297
Are you sure that's her motivation?

24:39.347 --> 24:40.946
It's... It's a deficit

24:40.947 --> 24:44.026
of drugs and reality bloody TV.

24:44.027 --> 24:45.426
Their sexual frustration,

24:45.427 --> 24:49.346
right, has caused them
to become so bitter and twisted...

24:49.347 --> 24:53.346
They're consumed by bloody hatred
and jealousy. I mean, look at him.

24:54.107 --> 24:57.746
I'm more than capable of satisfying
me own needs, thank you very much.

24:57.747 --> 24:59.546
That what you were just doing
in the toilets?

24:59.547 --> 25:01.026
No...

25:01.027 --> 25:02.386
No.

25:02.387 --> 25:03.586
Fuck.

25:03.587 --> 25:05.226
I mean, what are we talking about?

25:05.318 --> 25:06.717
Nadine!

25:06.718 --> 25:09.077
We need to break Nadine
out of the convent,

25:09.078 --> 25:11.677
and the emphasis here is on "we",
right?

25:11.678 --> 25:15.677
We, we, we. You need to help me.
Who's going to help me? Come on!

25:16.038 --> 25:19.237
Oh, I see. Is that how it is?
Unbe-friggin'-lievable.

25:19.238 --> 25:22.397
The number of times
I've helped you two out.

25:22.398 --> 25:24.397
And you, man.
What about when you...

25:24.398 --> 25:27.837
the time you were so damn pissed,
you shat in your own bed,

25:27.838 --> 25:30.037
and who offered to swap wi' you? Me.

25:30.038 --> 25:31.917
That was you.

25:31.918 --> 25:34.437
You shat in your own bed
and then offered to swap with me.

25:34.438 --> 25:35.477
Did I?

25:35.478 --> 25:36.797
Yeah.

25:36.798 --> 25:38.517
Yeah, and why did I do that?

25:38.518 --> 25:40.517
Because you didn't want to sleep
in your own shit.

25:40.518 --> 25:41.837
That's incorrect.

25:41.838 --> 25:44.357
It's because
that's what friends do, innit?

25:44.358 --> 25:48.357
It's... It's all for one
and one for all, and a nun.

25:53.638 --> 25:54.637
So, what the plan?

25:54.638 --> 25:55.837
Hmm?

25:55.838 --> 25:59.077
I don't have... I've... no idea.
I'm sorry, I've not thought of owt.

25:59.078 --> 26:00.517
Do you ever think we suffer from

26:00.518 --> 26:02.637
a complete lack of ambition
and imagination?

26:02.638 --> 26:04.277
I guess that's why we live in an age

26:04.278 --> 26:06.357
of chronically high youth unemployment.

26:06.358 --> 26:08.837
Shut up, man. I'm not a youth, am I?

26:08.838 --> 26:11.317
Unless you're a ticket inspector
on the bus, then I'm 15.

26:11.318 --> 26:14.877
So that little exchange got us
a whole lot closer into figuring out

26:14.878 --> 26:18.557
how to bust in to a convent
full of evil bitch nuns, hmm!

26:18.558 --> 26:22.557
Use the special powers you got after
being struck by that freak storm.

26:23.878 --> 26:27.037
It's just a thought.

26:27.038 --> 26:28.917
You know, we really should
use them more often.

26:28.918 --> 26:32.917
Hmm.

27:17.598 --> 27:20.157
Piece of cake.

27:20.158 --> 27:24.157
You've got blood
coming out of your ears.

27:33.478 --> 27:37.477
Whoa, shh!

27:43.278 --> 27:47.277
Nun, nun.

27:56.238 --> 28:00.237
No nun.

28:01.158 --> 28:03.317
Shh! Now, shut up.
Sister Ca...

28:03.318 --> 28:05.117
Ohh!

28:05.118 --> 28:05.917
Shit!

28:05.918 --> 28:09.277
Oh, no. That's really bad.

28:09.278 --> 28:11.037
You just head-butted a nun.

28:11.038 --> 28:13.597
Hail Mary, full of grace.
Hail Mary, full of grace.

28:13.598 --> 28:17.597
It's fine. She's...
She's an evil bitch nun.

28:17.758 --> 28:20.957
I don't care how evil and bitchy
she is. I'm not kicking a nun.

28:20.958 --> 28:22.557
That's seven years' bad luck.

28:22.558 --> 28:25.117
Hail Mary, full of grace.
Hail Mary, full of grace.

28:25.118 --> 28:27.837
Hail Mary, full of grace.

28:27.838 --> 28:30.717
Hail Mary, full of grace.
Hail Mary, full of grace.

28:30.718 --> 28:31.277
Rudy?

28:31.278 --> 28:32.317
Nadine!

28:32.318 --> 28:34.797
I'm in here.

28:34.798 --> 28:37.277
I'm here to rescue you
from the clutches

28:37.278 --> 28:41.277
of the evil bitch nuns. Get back!

28:44.358 --> 28:48.357
Come on, we've got to go.

29:35.998 --> 29:39.517
I-I-I thought you were
on your community service.

29:39.518 --> 29:43.437
We all ditched it
because we had to rescue Rudy's nun.

29:43.438 --> 29:46.197
Some evil bitch nuns were holding
her prisoner. Got another of those?

29:46.198 --> 29:50.197
Alex.

29:52.958 --> 29:56.957
Jess, I...

29:59.238 --> 30:00.477
You fucking prick.

30:00.478 --> 30:01.397
Who's she?

30:01.398 --> 30:03.637
I thought I was his girlfriend.

30:03.638 --> 30:04.517
I'm... I'm sorry.

30:04.518 --> 30:06.757
Don't fucking touch me!

30:06.758 --> 30:08.317
Jess, I...

30:08.318 --> 30:11.037
You've got a girlfriend?

30:11.038 --> 30:12.517
Yeah, you're so full of shit!

30:12.518 --> 30:15.157
Put your clothes on
and shut the door on your way out.

30:15.158 --> 30:19.157
You prick.

30:19.398 --> 30:21.997
You need a new TV.

30:21.998 --> 30:25.997
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

30:30.558 --> 30:34.557
That's my incredibly subtle way
of asking you if you want to fuck me.

30:36.078 --> 30:40.037
Do I want to fuck you? Well...

30:40.038 --> 30:42.237
Hmm. Well, that's
a very interesting question,

30:42.238 --> 30:44.037
with...

30:44.038 --> 30:45.557
many possible answers.

30:45.558 --> 30:46.957
Well, two answers.

30:46.958 --> 30:49.637
Do you need some time to think
about your feelings for Jess?

30:49.638 --> 30:52.597
Who said I had feelings for Jess?
There's...

30:52.598 --> 30:53.837
There's no feelings.

30:53.838 --> 30:56.477
Not on her part. It's your call.

30:56.478 --> 30:59.397
Let me know
when you make your decision.

30:59.398 --> 31:01.077
Are you saying you like me?

31:01.078 --> 31:02.917
Hmm...

31:02.918 --> 31:04.717
I need to fuck you to find out.

31:04.718 --> 31:07.437
It's a process of elimination.

31:07.438 --> 31:09.157
And they said romance is dead.

31:09.158 --> 31:10.717
If you don't want to, that's cool.

31:10.718 --> 31:13.917
That's not what I said, eh?

31:13.918 --> 31:16.277
Let's not be hasty...

31:16.278 --> 31:18.357
you, let's just...

31:18.358 --> 31:20.157
weigh up all the angles,

31:20.158 --> 31:23.797
you know, do a bit of geometry.

31:23.798 --> 31:25.357
OK. Yeah, let's fuck.

31:25.358 --> 31:26.357
Mmm?

31:26.358 --> 31:28.837
Mm-hm.

31:28.838 --> 31:32.477
You can start by rubbing my tit.

31:32.478 --> 31:33.917
Any particular one?

31:33.918 --> 31:37.917
You choose.

31:43.518 --> 31:46.557
Mmm.

31:48.998 --> 31:52.637
♪ Thick...

31:52.638 --> 31:56.637
♪ ..fingers round my neck
are grasping in

32:00.118 --> 32:04.117
♪ Have a drink and let this game begin

32:11.638 --> 32:13.237

33:00.918 --> 33:03.597
So, am I the one?

33:03.598 --> 33:05.637
Technically it really wasn't too bad.

33:05.638 --> 33:09.637
It's just for me, it was completely
lacking in passion and emotion.

33:11.198 --> 33:12.317
Really?

33:12.318 --> 33:15.677
Yeah. It's always like that.

33:15.678 --> 33:17.277
But look on the bright side.

33:17.278 --> 33:20.317
At least you got to come in me,
so that's a gooey silver lining.

33:20.318 --> 33:22.557
Hmm.

33:22.558 --> 33:24.717
So, is that it?

33:24.718 --> 33:28.717
Looks that way.

33:36.878 --> 33:39.997
Is there any paperwork
I have to complete?

33:39.998 --> 33:42.557
Why would there be any paperwork?

33:42.558 --> 33:46.557
Forget it.

33:47.158 --> 33:51.157
For such a little guy,
you've weirdly weighty balls.

33:53.758 --> 33:55.237
What's going on?

33:55.238 --> 33:59.237
It's all right,
we've finished shagging.

34:01.278 --> 34:01.957
Shit!

34:05.678 --> 34:06.917
Jess, wait.

34:06.918 --> 34:08.476
Jess.

34:08.478 --> 34:10.157
It's not what you think.

34:10.158 --> 34:12.877
Right, it is.
It... It's not how you think.

34:12.878 --> 34:14.516
That doesn't even mean anything.

34:14.518 --> 34:17.476
Like, the... the sex with Abbey,
that didn't mean anything.

34:17.478 --> 34:18.717
Nothing.

34:18.717 --> 34:20.277
It's like it didn't even happen.

34:20.277 --> 34:24.277
No. Didn't do anything for me either.

34:24.438 --> 34:25.917
What the fuck is wrong with you?

34:25.918 --> 34:28.516
I'm a lone wolf
in the journey of self-discovery.

34:28.518 --> 34:30.476
You're not a wolf. You're a slut.

34:30.478 --> 34:34.476
I get it. You like him now
he's shagging someone else.

34:35.277 --> 34:38.117
You like me?

34:38.118 --> 34:40.036
Jess.

34:40.038 --> 34:41.677
Oh, just fuck off.
Stay away from me.

34:41.678 --> 34:42.717
I'm sorry.

34:42.717 --> 34:43.837
What did you do to her?

34:43.838 --> 34:45.797
Stay out of it.
It's got nothing to do with you.

34:45.797 --> 34:47.317
Look, I-I screwed up, OK?

34:47.318 --> 34:49.317
Just fuck off.

34:49.318 --> 34:50.397
You heard her. Go.

34:50.398 --> 34:52.837
Seriously, get out my face.

34:52.838 --> 34:55.237
She wants you to leave.

34:55.237 --> 34:57.637
They're going to fight over you,
so that's all worked out.

34:57.638 --> 35:00.517
Why don't you just fuck off?

35:00.518 --> 35:04.517
Bring it, little man.

35:09.398 --> 35:11.757
Don't you fucking touch him!

35:11.758 --> 35:14.037
Jess. Stop. Jess.

35:14.038 --> 35:16.357
You should just choose
which one you want to be with.

35:16.358 --> 35:20.237
Fuck off, you stupid, weird cunt!

35:22.278 --> 35:25.157
Guys! Yes!

35:25.158 --> 35:28.157
'Ey! We've just made
sweet, beautiful love.

35:28.158 --> 35:32.157
Now we're going for a pizza.
Ham and pineapple. Can't believe

35:32.278 --> 35:36.277
they're putting fruit on pizzas now,
man. It's...

35:39.238 --> 35:41.557
That's your sperm, so that's awkward.

35:44.718 --> 35:45.917
No.

35:45.918 --> 35:47.237
What's that?

35:47.238 --> 35:49.077
It's them.

35:49.078 --> 35:50.717
Who?

35:50.718 --> 35:53.597
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

35:53.598 --> 35:57.597
Seriously?

36:01.278 --> 36:05.277
When I see people being cruel and
violent, that's when they come.

36:21.807 --> 36:23.206
So the nuns aren't evil bitches,

36:23.294 --> 36:25.453
they're just trying to protect us
from your power?

36:25.454 --> 36:27.373
I've head-butted an innocent nun
now!

36:27.374 --> 36:31.373
Hail Mary, full of grace. Hail Mary,
full of grace. Hail Mary... Ohh.

36:32.574 --> 36:36.573
Shit!

36:38.152 --> 36:39.571
They're coming for us.

36:39.607 --> 36:41.246
But they haven't even got horses.

36:41.247 --> 36:43.246
Who has a horse around here?

36:43.247 --> 36:47.246
Four Cyclists of the Apocalypse
doesn't have the same ring to it.

36:51.607 --> 36:53.486
OK, go. Go!

36:53.487 --> 36:55.466
Shit! Hail Mary, full of grace.

36:55.490 --> 36:56.729
Hail Mary, full of grace.

36:56.730 --> 37:00.729
Hail Mary, full of grace.
Hail Mary, full of grace!

37:19.134 --> 37:21.493
Move! What the hell are you doing?

37:21.494 --> 37:25.493
Hurry up. Shit!

37:26.207 --> 37:27.686
He's cut me.

37:27.770 --> 37:28.609
I'm dying!

37:28.610 --> 37:29.769
It's just a graze, man.

37:29.770 --> 37:31.369
Oh, what, so you're a doctor now?

37:31.370 --> 37:35.369
Shut up!

37:41.490 --> 37:45.489
Run!

37:48.730 --> 37:52.729
No!

37:56.370 --> 38:00.369
No!

38:01.370 --> 38:04.809
Holy fuck!

38:04.810 --> 38:06.089
Abbey. Abbey.

38:06.090 --> 38:07.369
Abbey, are you OK?

38:07.370 --> 38:08.889
I was so scared.

38:08.890 --> 38:10.649
Shit-my-knickers terrified.

38:10.650 --> 38:14.649
As he was about to kill me,
I've never felt so alive.

38:35.850 --> 38:38.369
I'm sorry.

38:38.370 --> 38:42.369
You were a much better boyfriend
when you had a vagina.

38:42.370 --> 38:44.249
Shit! All right...

38:44.250 --> 38:48.249
Bollocks!
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

38:48.970 --> 38:50.569
This is why we can never be together.

38:50.570 --> 38:52.329
It's not safe for me
to leave the convent.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.209
No, listen, sweetheart,
stop it. Stop it.

38:54.210 --> 38:56.089
Calm down. Don't say those things.

38:56.090 --> 38:57.329
We are going to sort this out,

38:57.330 --> 38:59.689
deal with the bollocksing
Horsemen of the Apocalypse,

38:59.690 --> 39:02.249
fix your power,
then we are going on holiday,

39:02.250 --> 39:06.249
cos I friggin' love you, Nun Nadine.

39:08.610 --> 39:09.729
Is that it, then?

39:09.730 --> 39:11.689
Oh!

39:11.690 --> 39:15.689
Jess...

39:51.450 --> 39:55.449
Ohh...

39:56.010 --> 39:58.529
It's just a graze.

39:58.530 --> 39:59.529
My bad.

39:59.530 --> 40:00.929
We need to get him to a hospital.

40:00.930 --> 40:02.249
I'm gutted we're going to die

40:02.250 --> 40:05.409
before I had the chance
to find out what my story is.

40:05.410 --> 40:07.609
I've had it with you
and your emotional honesty.

40:07.610 --> 40:10.649
Would it kill you
just to sugar-coat it, just once?

40:10.650 --> 40:12.649
I'm sure we're all going to be fine.

40:13.370 --> 40:14.649
Maybe not him.

40:14.650 --> 40:16.689
There is one way to make them
disappear.

40:16.690 --> 40:18.609
Right, well, that sounds good. How?

40:18.610 --> 40:21.769
If she dies, they die.

40:21.770 --> 40:25.769
It's her power.

40:27.850 --> 40:29.729
They're right.

40:29.730 --> 40:32.729
No, they're not right.
They're fucking... You're wrong.

40:32.730 --> 40:35.289
It's my fault.

40:35.290 --> 40:36.489
I brought them here.

40:36.490 --> 40:38.569
No. You're good.

40:38.570 --> 40:40.369
You're good and pure.

40:40.370 --> 40:42.569
D'you know what?
I have exposed you to a world

40:42.570 --> 40:45.409
where people just shit
all over each other, where they lie

40:45.410 --> 40:47.009
and they cheat...

40:47.010 --> 40:50.049
Cowardly, selfish, violent...

40:50.050 --> 40:53.889
A world where fucking sperm
dribbles out of vaginae

40:53.890 --> 40:55.449
and just splatters on the floor.

40:55.450 --> 40:58.489
You are a pure, white rose,
you know that?

40:58.490 --> 41:00.729
In a sea of shit and piss.

41:00.730 --> 41:04.729
And I've defiled you
and I've defiled your petals.

41:05.210 --> 41:09.209
I'm really friggin' sorry.

41:14.330 --> 41:16.689
Moving speech,
but where does that leave us

41:16.690 --> 41:18.729
and the Four Horsemen
and the Apocalypse?

41:18.730 --> 41:21.689
We go out there
and we face them together.

41:21.690 --> 41:24.169
Really?
Is... Is that where we're at?

41:24.170 --> 41:28.169
One for all, all for one, and a nun.

41:28.210 --> 41:30.409
My nun.

41:30.410 --> 41:34.409
My beautiful nun, who I love
with all my heart, I swear.

41:34.970 --> 41:38.369
You'd really do that?

41:38.370 --> 41:42.369
You'd all die for me?

41:49.330 --> 41:51.929
Looks that way.

41:51.930 --> 41:53.769
So, who goes out there first?

41:53.770 --> 41:55.169
Someone's got to be first out.

41:55.170 --> 41:57.209
I'm going to go and get the straws.

41:57.210 --> 42:00.129
I'm really glad I met you.

42:00.130 --> 42:01.969
What?

42:01.970 --> 42:05.969
Oh, no. No! No!

42:08.130 --> 42:10.089
Nadine!

42:10.090 --> 42:14.089
Don't.

42:15.050 --> 42:19.049
No...

42:19.650 --> 42:23.649
Oh...

42:35.170 --> 42:36.889
No.

42:36.890 --> 42:40.889
This isn't how it's supposed to be.

42:44.290 --> 42:46.809
Oh, no.

42:46.810 --> 42:50.369
I wanted an ET ending.

42:50.370 --> 42:54.369
Ohh...

42:55.050 --> 42:59.049
No...

43:21.010 --> 43:25.009
I really loved her, you know?

43:30.450 --> 43:34.449
I know.

43:34.810 --> 43:38.809
I know you did.

43:54.210 --> 43:57.329
This is all wrong, this.

43:57.330 --> 43:59.369
I wanted me ET ending.

43:59.370 --> 44:02.569
At least we got some BMXs out of it.

44:02.570 --> 44:06.369
I always wanted a BMX.

44:06.370 --> 44:08.729
I just remembered that!
I just remembered something.

44:08.730 --> 44:10.329
That's a clue.

44:10.330 --> 44:11.769
To what?

44:11.770 --> 44:14.529
To my true identity.

44:14.530 --> 44:18.169
OK, think... BMX.

44:18.170 --> 44:21.209
No, I'm still on ET, love, I'm sorry.

44:23.690 --> 44:25.049
Hello?

44:25.050 --> 44:26.649
Is he OK?

44:26.650 --> 44:29.849
Jesus, um...

44:29.850 --> 44:31.969
I don't know his family.
I know he's a barman.

44:31.970 --> 44:33.609
Yeah...

44:33.610 --> 44:36.009
I'm on my way. OK.

44:36.010 --> 44:37.049
Bye.

44:37.050 --> 44:39.089
That was the hospital.

44:39.090 --> 44:43.049
It's Alex. He's got a punctured
lung, they're giving him...

44:43.050 --> 44:45.129
Argh!

44:45.130 --> 44:47.569
They're giving him a lung transplant.

44:47.570 --> 44:48.889
Shit!

44:48.890 --> 44:52.569
I'll tell you now, you don't want to
be getting a transplant round here.

44:52.570 --> 44:53.929
Why's that?

44:53.930 --> 44:57.289
Well, Curtis told me about this girl
he was seein' this one time,

44:57.290 --> 44:59.769
right, and she had an 'eart transplant.

44:59.770 --> 45:02.049
She ended up getting hersel'
a teleportation power.

45:02.050 --> 45:06.049
And then she ended up getting killed
by a guy who controlled cheese.

45:07.850 --> 45:11.449
I'm sure Alex the sexy barman
is going to be fine.

45:11.450 --> 45:15.449
What's the chance
of it happening again, really?
