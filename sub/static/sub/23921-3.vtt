01:17.327 --> 01:19.496
[engine whirring]

01:21.998 --> 01:25.210
[Ryner] Part of me misses
my people's exile in the forest.

01:25.293 --> 01:29.047
But since Olkarion became the hub
for refugees in this quadrant,

01:29.672 --> 01:32.217
it made sense
that we should return to the city

01:32.300 --> 01:34.886
and transform it
into the Coalition's capital.

01:35.470 --> 01:38.056
So much has changed so fast.

01:38.139 --> 01:41.976
-For the better.
-Yeah, well, Zarkon may be dead,

01:42.060 --> 01:43.561
but the war's not over yet.

01:44.312 --> 01:47.023
[Ryner] That is why the Olkari
are grateful Voltron is here

01:47.106 --> 01:49.442
until our defense systems
are fully operational.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.488
I fear tumultuous times are upon us.

01:59.369 --> 02:02.330
[Letch] Galra Central Command
has confirmed the reports, General.

02:03.248 --> 02:06.584
Emperor Zarkon... is dead.

02:07.627 --> 02:11.131
[Branko] And is the intel true
that Voltron is on Olkarion?

02:11.840 --> 02:14.384
[Letch] Multiple intelligence reports
say so, sir.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.931
Set a course for Olkarion.

02:28.273 --> 02:32.944
-They should be here any minute.
-Good. There is much to discuss.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.363
Are you all right?

02:36.614 --> 02:37.824
I'll be fine.

02:41.786 --> 02:43.872
What you did was for the greater good.

02:43.955 --> 02:47.500
And for many of us,
proof of your intentions for peace.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.462
[keypad beeps]

02:55.508 --> 02:58.970
Look, it's Prince Lotor,
just hangin' out on the bridge.

02:59.053 --> 03:00.847
Guess this is a thing that's happening.

03:00.930 --> 03:02.849
I suppose
we'll have to get used to it--

03:02.932 --> 03:04.976
like my Zarbloovian intestinal eel.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.853
-[muffled screech]
-Easy, fella.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.147
What's going on, Lotor?

03:09.647 --> 03:13.610
The death of my father has created
a power vacuum within the Galra Empire.

03:13.693 --> 03:17.447
The most formidable Galra leaders will
gather for what is called the Kral Zera

03:17.530 --> 03:21.284
sometime in the next two days
to decide who will take the throne.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.244
We must be there.

03:24.287 --> 03:27.707
So, you want  us  to fly  you
into the middle of a meeting

03:27.790 --> 03:30.168
with all of the most powerful
Galra leaders?

03:30.251 --> 03:33.338
Lotor, we appreciate
all that you've sacrificed,

03:33.421 --> 03:35.006
but this sounds far too dangerous.

03:35.506 --> 03:38.426
We've been in more dangerous situations
with much less to gain.

03:38.509 --> 03:41.429
Putting Lotor on the Galra throne
is   what we've been discussing.

03:41.512 --> 03:45.183
Yeah, but no one told us
that would mean flying into a war zone.

03:45.266 --> 03:48.519
We can't plan an operation
this important so quickly.

03:48.603 --> 03:49.812
We don't have a choice.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.148
I'm with Allura.
We need time to think this over.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.734
Lance, this is not your call.

03:56.569 --> 04:00.406
Allura, the Coalition wouldn't be
where it is right now without Lotor.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.283
We need to listen to him.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.495
Well, I'm with Allura, too.

04:05.578 --> 04:08.081
This is too dangerous
to pull off at the last minute.

04:08.164 --> 04:11.542
Agreed. So, it looks like
it's four-to-two, in the Princess's favor.

04:11.626 --> 04:12.835
Look, this isn't a vote.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.421
I'm the leader of Voltron.
I'm making this decision.

04:15.505 --> 04:19.007
Like when you armed Lotor with your bayard
without consulting the rest of us?

04:19.091 --> 04:22.804
That's right. Making that decision
resulted in the removal of Zarkon.

04:22.887 --> 04:24.847
You put the entire operation in jeopardy.

04:24.931 --> 04:28.851
I put an end to Zarkon's reign.
Now is the time to finish the job.

04:29.894 --> 04:34.482
-Shiro, we're all on the same side here.
-I told you to stay out of this!

04:35.358 --> 04:37.402
[Lotor] While you all
waste time squabbling,

04:37.485 --> 04:40.613
sinister forces are conspiring
to fill the Galra power void.

04:40.697 --> 04:45.118
If I do not return to claim the throne,
there is no telling who will.

04:45.743 --> 04:47.120
[Shiro] Good. It's settled.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.207
-[Pidge]  How's that settled?
-[Shiro]  Our hands are tied.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.876
The Kral Zera is happening.
If we want to stop the Galra,

04:53.960 --> 04:56.087
we need to put Lotor
on the throne immediately.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.714
My son.

05:03.219 --> 05:04.304
Aah! [grunts]

05:14.355 --> 05:17.108
[cackling, echoing]

05:20.028 --> 05:21.237
[gasps]

05:21.321 --> 05:22.530
Hmm.

05:22.613 --> 05:23.698
[yells]

05:27.118 --> 05:28.119
[Sniv] Is it done?

05:28.661 --> 05:32.415
With that witch out of the way,
I'll be one step closer to taking power.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.418
[Haggar] Wrong, Commander Sniv.

05:35.501 --> 05:36.586
Huh?

05:41.174 --> 05:43.426
[sighs] What are they planning
to do to us?

05:43.509 --> 05:46.429
We tried to help Emperor Zarkon,
wasn't our fault he got killed.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.766
[Acxa] It doesn't matter.
We won't live to see the new regime.

05:50.308 --> 05:53.144
Whoever comes through that door
will likely be our undertaker.

05:53.227 --> 05:56.481
Whoever comes through that door next
is gonna get a face full of fists!

05:56.564 --> 05:57.732
[door unlocks]

06:09.952 --> 06:11.579
Are you here to kill us?

06:12.455 --> 06:15.124
No. I'm here to recruit you.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.428
Prepare the payload.

06:28.304 --> 06:31.682
The Olkari scientists were good
for something after all.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.187
[beeping]

06:38.314 --> 06:41.150
[whirring]

06:42.902 --> 06:44.153
[cannon blast]

06:47.657 --> 06:49.909
By the time this day is over,

06:49.992 --> 06:55.206
Galra High Command will realize
I am the only one worthy of the throne.

06:58.042 --> 06:59.544
[sonic boom]

07:17.311 --> 07:18.438
[whooshing]

07:18.521 --> 07:20.022
[explosion]

07:22.400 --> 07:24.277
Ryner hailing Castle of Lions.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.195
Ryner, what was that?

07:26.279 --> 07:29.365
A meteor-like object
struck the forest outside the city.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.951
We're detecting high levels
of an unknown toxin

07:32.034 --> 07:33.744
emanating from the impact site.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.289
I'll check it out.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.044
[sands sliding]

07:46.883 --> 07:49.385
[creaking and crackling]

08:05.693 --> 08:10.364
[Haggar] Until a new leader steps in,
the Galra Empire weakens by the moment.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.617
Are you planning to seize power?

08:13.284 --> 08:17.497
No. The empire will only accept a ruler
with Galra blood.

08:18.289 --> 08:24.045
It needs a natural-born leader,
with an iron will to match his iron fist.

08:24.128 --> 08:28.716
Bring him to me,
and I will pardon your past misdeeds.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.139
[laser fire]

08:44.732 --> 08:45.775
[weapon cocking]

08:47.527 --> 08:49.070
[electricity crackling]

08:52.907 --> 08:54.700
[grunting]

08:54.784 --> 08:55.785
[groans]

08:58.412 --> 09:00.498
[grunting]

09:00.581 --> 09:02.833
[panting]

09:02.917 --> 09:03.960
Huh?

09:07.964 --> 09:09.882
[grunting]

09:15.388 --> 09:16.681
Whoa.

09:16.764 --> 09:19.267
I haven't seen that for 10,000 years.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.811
[stammers] Allura?

09:21.894 --> 09:24.272
It's an Altean broadsword.

09:24.355 --> 09:26.357
My father used one just like it.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.819
I have no idea how I did this.

09:29.902 --> 09:33.447
I think your bayard has shown you
what we've all been noticing.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.700
You have greatness within.

09:35.783 --> 09:38.077
Huh. I don't think Shiro has noticed.

09:39.203 --> 09:41.414
Shiro has been quite difficult lately.

09:41.497 --> 09:45.334
I'm not sure what to do,
we seem to constantly be at odds.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.878
You guys are under a lot of pressure.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.839
Having Lotor around doesn't help.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.009
Sometimes it feels like it was easier
to fight the Galra

09:53.092 --> 09:55.094
rather than to try to work with them.

09:55.177 --> 09:58.139
You both have
the coalition's best interests at heart.

09:58.222 --> 10:00.891
Don't forget that. Shiro isn't your enemy.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.897
You're right.
I need to stay focused on the big picture.

10:07.648 --> 10:08.941
Thank you, Lance.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.611
Speaking with you
has actually made me feel better.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.155
What do you mean "actually"?

10:14.989 --> 10:17.241
[both laughing]

10:17.325 --> 10:20.911
Oh, and, Lance, if you're going to try
to control a sword this powerful...

10:20.995 --> 10:23.289
-[Allura grunts]
-[Lance groans]

10:23.372 --> 10:25.625
...you're going to need to work
on your stance.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.547
[Pidge] I developed a cloaking device
by reverse engineering technology

10:31.631 --> 10:33.341
from the invisible maze in the Castle

10:33.424 --> 10:35.718
and integrating it
with the lion's shield system.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.637
It's just amazing.

10:37.720 --> 10:41.807
All this technology--
it used to exist only in my dreams.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.310
I can't wait to tell your mother
all about this.

10:44.393 --> 10:47.146
Wait till she sees you two. So grown up.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.192
Well, the thing is,

10:51.275 --> 10:53.736
between the rebels and Voltron,

10:53.819 --> 10:57.198
Matt and I have a lot of work to do
before we can go back home.

10:57.823 --> 11:01.535
Right. We need to stay,
until the Galra are defeated

11:01.619 --> 11:04.121
and we can rest assured
Earth will always be safe.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.040
What?

11:06.707 --> 11:08.709
We can't go home with you, Dad.

11:15.383 --> 11:18.677
[wind gusting, whistling]

11:33.442 --> 11:35.903
-[beeping]
-[Shiro] I'm detecting movement up ahead.

11:36.445 --> 11:39.031
Coran, I'm going in for a closer look.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.497
[rumbling]

11:48.124 --> 11:49.083
[beeping]

11:49.166 --> 11:53.003
-Coran, we might have a big problem here.
- How big?

11:53.087 --> 11:55.005
[birds squawking]

11:59.677 --> 12:01.262
[Shiro] Coran! Send out the team!

12:03.597 --> 12:05.933
[Letch] The virus has reached
the Olkarion City.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.935
The Voltron Lions have been mobilized.

12:08.018 --> 12:09.019
Shall we move in?

12:09.937 --> 12:15.443
Slowly. So we can behold the dawn
of a new age of warfare.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.867
[yelling and clamoring]

12:34.670 --> 12:36.213
[Matt] What's happening out there?

12:36.297 --> 12:39.341
The forest appears to have come alive
and is attacking the city.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.885
Where are the lions?

12:40.968 --> 12:43.095
[Coran] I've already sent them
to assist Shiro.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.972
He's battling something in the forest.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.974
[grunting]

12:47.057 --> 12:49.059
[photons blasting]

12:54.148 --> 12:55.399
[explosion]

13:11.123 --> 13:13.209
[snarling]

13:14.502 --> 13:16.295
Ryner, what are we looking at here?

13:16.378 --> 13:20.299
I don't understand. That monster
resembles one of our tree-mechs.

13:20.382 --> 13:22.468
It's as if the forest is being corrupted.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.262
[Shiro] Must have something to do

13:25.346 --> 13:27.556
with whatever is emanating
from the impact site!

13:27.640 --> 13:30.226
[Pidge] It looks like
some sort of invasive plasma.

13:30.309 --> 13:33.646
Coran, have my dad and brother
analyze the data I'm sending!

13:33.729 --> 13:34.563
[Coran]  On it.

13:36.565 --> 13:39.276
Hurry up, team. Let's form Voltron!

13:39.985 --> 13:41.654
[roaring]

14:11.433 --> 14:12.268
[snarls]

14:27.283 --> 14:28.868
[photon cannon whirring, blasting]

14:31.495 --> 14:32.496
[Shiro] Shield up!

14:38.419 --> 14:40.337
[rustling]

14:45.134 --> 14:47.094
[monster growling]

14:47.177 --> 14:48.554
Let's finish him!

14:48.637 --> 14:51.849
I can't move my leg,
I mean, my Voltron leg!

14:52.766 --> 14:56.312
[Allura grunts] Neither can I!
These vines are restricting our movements!

14:56.395 --> 15:00.482
-[Shiro] Pidge, can you get free?
-Negative. They're everywhere.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.775
[paladins grunting]

15:01.859 --> 15:03.360
[Lance] Red's stuck too!

15:04.612 --> 15:06.322
[Allura] Separate into lions!

15:06.405 --> 15:09.366
[Shiro] We can't!
We're seized up! Trapped.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.829
-[loud bang]
-[rumbling]

15:19.001 --> 15:20.669
[rumbling]

15:26.842 --> 15:28.552
[Hunk] Wait. What's that sound?

15:30.012 --> 15:32.348
It sounds like it's heading the other way.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.183
And I think I know why.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.727
Ryner, is that ion cannon of yours
operational?

15:36.810 --> 15:40.731
No, it's still not finished.
At best it could manage perhaps one shot.

15:40.814 --> 15:43.901
[Shiro] Make it count,
'cause that thing's headed right for you.

15:43.984 --> 15:45.945
[cannon charge whirring]

15:46.028 --> 15:47.613
-[beeping]
-[Ryner] Targeting.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.865
Cannon charge at 30%.

15:51.367 --> 15:55.037
-Power at 70%. Target acquired!
-[target lock beeps]

15:55.621 --> 15:58.832
Power at 95%, prepare to fire!

15:59.375 --> 16:00.626
[whirring slowing]

16:00.709 --> 16:03.879
No! We're losing power! What's happening?

16:03.963 --> 16:05.422
[rumbling, rustling]

16:06.298 --> 16:10.135
The ion cannon! All of our systems,
they've been compromised.

16:14.390 --> 16:17.142
[Pidge]  Matt! Dad! These vines...

16:17.226 --> 16:19.103
They're like a computer virus.

16:19.186 --> 16:21.563
From data you sent,
it appears the plasma substance

16:21.647 --> 16:23.899
is self-replicating organic wetware.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.110
Which creates a single expanding system,

16:26.193 --> 16:29.697
giving it the ability to interface
with nature the way the Olkari do.

16:30.239 --> 16:33.325
[Pidge]  It's like a computer
and a virus rolled into one.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.578
-[alert blares]
-Quiznak! Now Voltron is offline.

16:37.204 --> 16:39.790
If the plasma mass
has the properties of a computer,

16:39.873 --> 16:42.668
there must be some way
to hack into it and shut it down.

16:43.127 --> 16:47.256
Conceivably. If we could just figure out
how to interface with it.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.515
What are we gonna do?
I can't move!

16:56.974 --> 17:01.186
Listen! This virus is affecting Voltron
on a sub-molecular level.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.897
To drive it out,
we have to tap into the quantum energy

17:03.981 --> 17:05.733
that bonds us all to Voltron!

17:05.816 --> 17:09.528
The bayards!
They amplify each paladin's life force!

17:09.611 --> 17:12.865
They might provide enough power
to drive out the virus!

17:12.948 --> 17:13.949
It's worth a shot.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.200
[grunts]

17:24.710 --> 17:27.588
It's the Galra! This is all their doing.

17:31.175 --> 17:34.261
I'm trying to interface with the vines
to stop their growth,

17:34.344 --> 17:36.764
but I can't communicate
with the nano-cellulose.

17:36.847 --> 17:40.350
We don't need to stop it.
We just need to reroute it.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.936
Grab a headpiece, show me.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.900
All right. Follow my lead.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.158
[low hum]

18:00.829 --> 18:01.830
[grunting]

18:01.914 --> 18:04.708
Three, two, one!

18:11.507 --> 18:13.092
[gasps, exhales]

18:26.313 --> 18:27.648
Shiro!

18:27.731 --> 18:28.982
Shiro!

18:29.983 --> 18:34.196
[all] Shiro! Shiro! Shiro! Shiro!

18:45.958 --> 18:49.086
[Shiro] Lance! Lance, listen to me!

18:49.169 --> 18:50.170
What?

18:53.215 --> 18:54.842
[growling]

19:04.309 --> 19:06.854
Voltron's broken free of the tractor beam!

19:06.937 --> 19:08.772
Fire all cannons!

19:11.483 --> 19:13.902
-[Hunk]  We're back!
-[Shiro]  Attack the cruiser!

19:13.986 --> 19:15.696
[Allura]  What about that tree-beast?

19:15.779 --> 19:17.906
-[Pidge]  Guys, we've got incoming!
-[gasps]

19:17.990 --> 19:20.826
-[rumbling]
-[low humming]

19:25.164 --> 19:26.165
[gasps]

19:26.832 --> 19:28.792
[yells]

19:31.086 --> 19:34.506
[humming fading]

19:34.590 --> 19:39.928
-Yes! We did it!
-Now, Voltron! You must stop that beast!

19:40.012 --> 19:42.014
[Shiro]  Let's finish this fight!

19:44.099 --> 19:45.893
[rumbling]

19:48.896 --> 19:51.148
[photon cannon whirring]

20:09.750 --> 20:11.168
[all yelling]

20:22.846 --> 20:25.515
-[metal creaking]
-Pidge, what's it doing?

20:25.599 --> 20:28.477
The virus! It's trying to absorb Voltron!

20:28.560 --> 20:29.895
[Hunk] I can't see anything!

20:30.896 --> 20:33.523
-[Shiro] Any of the lions free?
-[Pidge] It's got me!

20:33.607 --> 20:34.983
[Allura] Me, too!

20:35.567 --> 20:36.568
Lance!

20:38.862 --> 20:42.074
[yelling]

21:20.988 --> 21:24.408
[Sam] Kids, I need to talk to you again
about returning to Earth.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.493
Dad...

21:26.576 --> 21:31.373
No, listen. I understand now.
And I couldn't be more proud.

21:32.040 --> 21:35.210
The whole universe is finding out
what I've known all along.

21:36.086 --> 21:38.171
You two are something special.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.340
Oh, Dad...

21:43.677 --> 21:48.181
And they need you.
But I'm needed back on Earth.

21:51.435 --> 21:54.980
The Galaxy Garrison has to know
what's going on out here.

21:55.063 --> 21:57.983
They need to get ready.
There's a war coming.

21:59.818 --> 22:01.528
So this is goodbye?

22:03.030 --> 22:04.197
[Sam] For now.

22:09.202 --> 22:12.789
Hey, Shiro. What were you trying
to tell me in that void thing earlier?

22:12.873 --> 22:14.082
What do you mean?

22:14.166 --> 22:16.752
You were shouting at me,
but I couldn't hear you.

22:17.544 --> 22:20.047
I don't know.
Things went dark there for a second.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.508
But good work today.
I'm sorry I yelled at you earlier.

22:36.521 --> 22:40.567
-[keypad beeping]
-[door unlocks and opens]

22:42.486 --> 22:43.987
Look who we found.
