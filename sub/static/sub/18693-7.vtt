00:06.110 --> 00:07.860
[Isabelle] <i>Previously
on</i> Shadowhunters...

00:07.950 --> 00:10.086
[Aldertree] Can you pledge
unconditional loyalty to the Clave?

00:10.110 --> 00:11.990
No, I can't.
You want me to leave.

00:12.070 --> 00:13.530
You got a spare room?

00:14.330 --> 00:16.540
I would like to lead the
mission to the Iron Sisters.

00:16.620 --> 00:19.700
Your wound. There is something that
can make the infection go away.

00:19.790 --> 00:23.040
<i>- Yin fen.</i> A little goes a long way.
- [sighs]

00:24.170 --> 00:26.040
- Are you Luke's sister?
- I am.

00:26.630 --> 00:29.590
I need to ask you something.
I was given a message.

00:29.680 --> 00:30.970
<i>An image of a rune.</i>

00:33.350 --> 00:35.020
The Sword needs angelic energy?

00:35.100 --> 00:37.536
To activate the Sword,
it must be wielded by an angelic being,

00:37.560 --> 00:38.786
and struck by a
bolt of lightning.

00:38.810 --> 00:40.470
[Clary] Then it's
capable of mass murder.

00:40.560 --> 00:42.180
I thought this was
all behind you.

00:44.520 --> 00:45.560
[gasps]

00:45.650 --> 00:46.660
[rune searing]

01:24.440 --> 01:27.320
[Valentine] Most traitors
are harder to catch.

01:30.900 --> 01:32.070
[sighs]

01:34.160 --> 01:36.160
After all these years...

01:37.660 --> 01:39.830
why ignite your Circle
rune, hmm?

01:41.790 --> 01:45.260
- What's your game, Cleophas?
- There is no game.

01:45.330 --> 01:47.330
- I'm not a traitor.
- [scoffs]

01:47.420 --> 01:50.720
I did what I had to do after the Uprising,
but I never stopped believing in you.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.640
You were all cowards.

01:53.220 --> 01:54.970
Giving up the minute
you thought I was dead.

01:55.050 --> 01:56.116
[Cleophas] I had no choice.

01:56.140 --> 01:58.060
Becoming an Iron Sister
was about survival.

01:58.140 --> 01:59.940
It was that or a death sentence.

02:00.020 --> 02:01.980
You're following in
your mother's footsteps.

02:02.060 --> 02:03.150
That's very sweet.

02:04.020 --> 02:05.100
When I met your daughter,

02:05.190 --> 02:07.570
and heard that you were
alive, I knew there was hope.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.070
I knew I had a second chance.

02:11.030 --> 02:14.080
And what do you
know about Clarissa?

02:15.030 --> 02:16.820
She created a rune.

02:17.990 --> 02:20.780
Valentine, in all my training,
I've never seen anything like it.

02:22.290 --> 02:23.540
She's special.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.330
You expect me to take
you at your word?

02:30.920 --> 02:32.380
I will prove it to you.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.730
You know, old friend...

02:46.730 --> 02:49.530
I freed you from
your entombment,

02:49.610 --> 02:52.280
granted you shelter,
and this is what you do?

02:53.280 --> 02:54.700
[shuddering]

02:54.780 --> 02:58.790
Warning Clarissa is futile. You know that.
I already have the Mortal Sword.

03:02.700 --> 03:05.370
The storm is coming...

03:06.500 --> 03:08.510
whether you like it or not.

03:10.670 --> 03:14.100
Leave my daughter alone.

03:19.510 --> 03:21.220
[thunder rumbling]

03:26.310 --> 03:27.810
[distorted screaming]

03:34.030 --> 03:35.530
[gasps]

03:40.830 --> 03:42.120
Hey, did you hear that?

03:42.910 --> 03:46.080
- Hear what?
- That sound just now.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.240
What sound?
I didn't hear anything.

03:50.380 --> 03:51.970
Never mind.

04:17.110 --> 04:18.519
[thunder rumbling]

04:21.700 --> 04:23.710
I mean, how would they feel?

04:23.780 --> 04:26.020
{\an8}Well, I'm glad you didn't ask
in front of the sushi chef.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.000
{\an8}Well, seriously,
why do they call it fatty tuna?

04:28.080 --> 04:30.580
{\an8}-I mean, that's a little degrading.
- Hmm, well...

04:30.670 --> 04:32.550
{\an8}I don't think obese
tuna sounds any better.

04:33.630 --> 04:36.390
{\an8}You know,
as much as I love Tokyo and Prague,

04:36.460 --> 04:38.670
{\an8}a bacon burger from the
East Village isn't that bad.

04:38.760 --> 04:40.760
{\an8}The world is your
oyster, Alexander.

04:44.220 --> 04:46.430
- I got you something.
- Me?

04:46.520 --> 04:48.060
Yes, you.

04:49.980 --> 04:51.610
Open it.

04:58.320 --> 05:00.870
{\an8}It's supposed to bring
you luck and protection.

05:02.320 --> 05:03.490
{\an8}Thank you, Alexander.

05:05.160 --> 05:08.920
- You continue to surprise me.
- In good ways, I hope.

05:10.250 --> 05:12.170
{\an8}[Jace and Kaelie giggling]

05:12.250 --> 05:13.670
{\an8}[both sigh]

05:13.750 --> 05:16.620
{\an8}I haven't had a roommate
this brazen since...

05:16.710 --> 05:19.840
{\an8}Well, since Casanova and I spent
the night in the Doge's Palace.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.340
[grunts] Casanova?

05:22.430 --> 05:24.770
I'll talk to Jace.
He can't stay here forever.

05:24.850 --> 05:27.850
No, no.
Nothing a little magic can't fix.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.150
[upbeat music playing]

05:31.810 --> 05:32.970
Hmm.

05:34.060 --> 05:35.270
All good?

05:36.860 --> 05:37.900
[both chuckle]

05:39.820 --> 05:41.700
[Clary] Hey, Simon, you here?

05:45.450 --> 05:46.960
Hey.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.070
{\an8}Hey.

05:50.160 --> 05:53.240
{\an8}-Wow, you look...
- Overdressed.

05:53.330 --> 05:57.210
{\an8}No. No, you look, uh, great.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.130
{\an8}Really? It's not too wrinkled?
I mean...

05:59.210 --> 06:01.920
{\an8}-I don't really own an iron, so...
- [chuckles] You have plans?

06:02.010 --> 06:04.430
{\an8}Yeah. I'm hanging out with, uh...
with Maia.

06:06.350 --> 06:09.440
{\an8}-Luke's Maia.
- Well, she's not technically Luke's.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.326
{\an8}I mean, they're part of the same
pack, but that's...

06:11.350 --> 06:12.930
{\an8}-Yeah, right.
- [chuckles]

06:13.020 --> 06:16.940
{\an8}-Uh, so, you guys are hanging out?
- Yeah, I mean...

06:18.520 --> 06:19.850
That's okay, right?

06:19.940 --> 06:23.520
No, that's unacceptable.
I am your only friend.

06:23.610 --> 06:25.940
{\an8}It's in the bylaws. Come on.

06:28.580 --> 06:29.750
{\an8}What's wrong?

06:30.660 --> 06:31.950
Nothing.

06:32.540 --> 06:34.920
Look who you're talking to, Fray.
Come on.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.670
Something's up. I can tell.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.170
No, I...

06:40.920 --> 06:41.920
I just...

06:42.880 --> 06:44.250
[Clary sighs]

06:45.010 --> 06:46.770
I had this...
[stutters] I don't know,

06:46.840 --> 06:49.680
this really strange
experience at the Institute,

06:49.760 --> 06:52.036
{\an8}-and I can't explain it...
- What kind of strange experience?

06:52.060 --> 06:53.616
{\an8}[stammering] Look, I can...
I can totally reschedule.

06:53.640 --> 06:56.140
If you need me, I'm here.

06:58.940 --> 07:00.990
No, I'm... I'm fine. Really.

07:01.070 --> 07:02.160
[inhales deeply]

07:03.110 --> 07:04.110
{\an8}Go.

07:05.030 --> 07:06.160
{\an8}Have a good time.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.700
{\an8}You sure?

07:11.950 --> 07:13.120
{\an8}[cell phone chimes]

07:13.700 --> 07:15.280
{\an8}[Clary stammering]

07:15.370 --> 07:16.490
[cell phone beeps]

07:18.670 --> 07:20.970
I have to go anyway, so...

07:25.630 --> 07:27.590
{\an8}But don't worry
about the wrinkles.

07:29.260 --> 07:30.880
{\an8}She's not gonna notice.

07:41.570 --> 07:42.860
[cell phone chiming]

07:44.240 --> 07:45.320
{\an8}[Alec sighs]

07:47.700 --> 07:48.790
Damn it.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.450
I need to go.

07:53.370 --> 07:55.080
Go do your job, Shadowhunter.

07:56.540 --> 07:58.300
I'm not going anywhere.

08:01.250 --> 08:02.790
{\an8}[Alec sighs] All right.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.250
[Kaelie giggling]

08:11.180 --> 08:14.520
{\an8}-What's this one do?
- Flexibility.

08:17.100 --> 08:18.560
[laughing]

08:21.520 --> 08:23.940
- And this one?
- Stamina.

08:24.020 --> 08:26.440
Ooh, I like the sound of that.

08:29.820 --> 08:32.190
We have orders. Let's go.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.360
[sighs] I'm a little tied up.

08:34.450 --> 08:36.990
- Not yet, you're not.
- [both chuckle]

08:39.250 --> 08:40.750
You're welcome to join us.

08:40.830 --> 08:42.289
I'm good.

08:42.380 --> 08:43.720
Your loss.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.330
I'll give you two a minute.

08:57.220 --> 08:59.970
This is your solution?
Hiding out at Magnus'?

09:00.060 --> 09:01.850
I wouldn't exactly
call this hiding.

09:01.940 --> 09:03.530
- We have obligations.
- Obligations.

09:03.610 --> 09:06.200
Aldertree wanted me
gone and I'm gone.

09:06.280 --> 09:10.030
So you got demoted. So what?
You'll work your way back up.

09:10.110 --> 09:11.820
- You don't understand.
- Then tell me.

09:11.910 --> 09:13.660
Whatever it is,
it can't be that bad.

09:15.700 --> 09:18.110
So you're just gonna
turn your back on us?

09:18.200 --> 09:20.120
On Isabelle? Clary?

09:20.210 --> 09:23.920
- I told you I'm not discussing Clary.
- She's your family. Your sister.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.410
I don't need a reminder.

09:25.500 --> 09:26.790
[Jace sighs]

09:27.500 --> 09:31.300
You know, you should go.
We don't want you getting benched, too.

09:34.970 --> 09:36.010
This isn't you.

09:40.020 --> 09:41.230
[sighs]

09:43.560 --> 09:44.890
Any idea what this is about?

09:44.980 --> 09:48.060
Heard a big storm's moving in.
Always increases demon activity.

09:48.150 --> 09:50.030
- And Jace is...
- Not here.

09:50.110 --> 09:51.190
He's totally shut me out.

09:51.280 --> 09:54.950
He's not answering my texts.
I don't understand what's going on.

09:55.990 --> 09:58.150
Me neither. Come on.

10:02.830 --> 10:04.410
What did we miss?

10:04.500 --> 10:07.080
[sighs] Let's see.
The Citadel was breached.

10:07.170 --> 10:09.300
Magdalena is dead.
Cleophas is missing.

10:09.380 --> 10:10.380
[Clary] Oh, my God.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.960
[sighs] Valentine?

10:13.050 --> 10:14.890
Who else could it be?

10:15.680 --> 10:17.736
Aldertree's heading to Idris
to meet with the Council.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.340
I'll go check with ops.

10:20.560 --> 10:24.400
Izzy. There's something I need to
tell you about Sister Cleophas.

10:24.480 --> 10:26.110
That you told her
about your new rune?

10:26.860 --> 10:29.070
- How did you know I...
- Does it matter?

10:29.150 --> 10:30.206
You should know
what it feels like

10:30.230 --> 10:32.150
when the people you
care about shut you out.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.716
Izzy, Jace told me it would be
dangerous for anyone who found out.

10:34.740 --> 10:36.410
So now I need to be protected?

10:36.490 --> 10:39.070
- [sighs]
- I welcomed you in, Clary.

10:39.160 --> 10:42.750
Saw you through training, rescued
Simon every time he got into trouble,

10:42.830 --> 10:44.936
which is basically all of the
time, and after your mom...

10:44.960 --> 10:46.960
Izzy, I'm sorry.

10:47.040 --> 10:49.500
[sighs] Look,
we both care about the Iron Sisters.

10:49.590 --> 10:52.050
We need to find Sister Cleophas.

10:52.130 --> 10:53.590
We can do it together.

10:55.220 --> 10:57.560
I'm kind of over this
whole togetherness thing.

11:03.520 --> 11:04.730
[sighs]

11:31.880 --> 11:33.930
- [sighs]
- [Lindsay] What are you doing in here?

11:37.010 --> 11:40.140
I'm here on Aldertree's orders.
What are you doing here?

11:40.220 --> 11:42.656
Oh, I was just walking to the ops
center, and I heard something.

11:42.680 --> 11:44.840
Well, now that you know it's just
me, get back to work.

11:49.520 --> 11:50.980
[breathing heavily]

12:16.260 --> 12:17.760
[grunting]

12:32.310 --> 12:35.940
- [Magnus] Thank you, my dear.
- On the house for my best tipper.

12:36.030 --> 12:38.280
Never trust a stingy
warlock, Maia.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.780
Not when we have an
eternity to acquire wealth.

12:41.990 --> 12:43.780
I'll remember that.

12:45.410 --> 12:47.820
- What you got there?
- A gift.

12:49.670 --> 12:51.760
I can't remember the last
time someone bought me one.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.210
I'm used to people
making demands.

12:55.300 --> 12:59.350
"Reinforce the wards,
Magnus." "Heal my broken heart, Magnus."

12:59.430 --> 13:01.100
"Portal me to Paris, Magnus."

13:01.180 --> 13:02.310
[sighs]

13:03.390 --> 13:04.480
[chuckles]

13:04.560 --> 13:06.310
Is it from someone special?

13:08.350 --> 13:09.730
I think so.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.160
Are you Rufus?

13:18.230 --> 13:20.320
What are you in the mood
for, Shadowhunter?

13:20.900 --> 13:23.070
Dream gels? Energy powder?

13:23.160 --> 13:24.620
<i>Yin fen.</i>

13:25.870 --> 13:27.620
Dancing with the devil, are we?

13:28.700 --> 13:31.240
Yeah, I could track some down.
Won't be cheap.

13:31.330 --> 13:32.740
Whatever it costs.

13:32.830 --> 13:34.160
Rufus, my man.

13:35.090 --> 13:36.810
I wish I could say it
was lovely to see you.

13:36.840 --> 13:38.890
Magnus, what are you doing here?

13:38.960 --> 13:41.130
The question is,
what is Rufus doing here?

13:41.800 --> 13:44.050
He knows he's banned
from North America...

13:45.050 --> 13:46.590
indefinitely.

13:48.310 --> 13:49.350
[sighs]

13:55.730 --> 13:57.310
[speaking Spanish]

13:58.530 --> 13:59.780
I'm here on business.

14:01.650 --> 14:03.110
[grunts]

14:03.200 --> 14:05.040
Drug dealer business?

14:05.120 --> 14:09.000
Exactly. Trying to crack down
on the Downworlder drug trade.

14:09.080 --> 14:12.590
Isabelle, I don't need magic
to know when I'm being lied to.

14:14.170 --> 14:15.970
There's been a spike in
the demand for <i>yin fen</i>

14:16.000 --> 14:18.080
and I have orders
to find the source.

14:18.670 --> 14:20.540
If you don't believe
me, call Aldertree.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.010
Apologies.

14:25.590 --> 14:28.510
I've seen the havoc <i>yin fen</i> can
wreak up close and personal.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.900
Nearly cost my
friend Jem his life.

14:32.980 --> 14:36.690
- Do you know where to look for the source?
- Definitely not Rufus.

14:36.770 --> 14:40.150
But if you wanna stop a
<i>yin fen</i> distribution ring,

14:40.230 --> 14:44.110
- you'll need to find the kingpin.
- Any ideas on who that might be?

14:45.320 --> 14:47.570
Probably one of
the Night Children.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.330
<i>Yin fen</i> is made
from vampire venom.

14:50.410 --> 14:54.240
When people get desperate enough,
they go straight to the vamps.

14:56.250 --> 14:59.970
- Good to know.
- This is dangerous business, Isabelle.

15:01.130 --> 15:02.470
Be careful.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.170
I always am.

15:15.310 --> 15:17.770
[Luke] So you met Cleophas?
[Clary] At the Citadel.

15:17.850 --> 15:20.060
I'm trying to figure out
this new rune ability and...

15:20.150 --> 15:21.700
Wait, hold it. Rune ability?

15:21.780 --> 15:24.620
I was somehow able
to create a new rune.

15:24.700 --> 15:27.540
- I didn't even know that was possible.
- Neither did I.

15:27.610 --> 15:31.990
Luke, it was the most incredible thing.
I... I shot sunlight out of my hand.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.790
Jace said not to tell anyone,
but Cleophas was your sister,

15:34.870 --> 15:36.700
and if Valentine has
hurt her or worse, I...

15:36.790 --> 15:38.606
Hold it, hold it. Clary...
Clary, listen to me.

15:38.630 --> 15:41.380
- [sighs]
- Cleo may not be the victim here.

15:41.460 --> 15:43.170
She could be working
with Valentine.

15:43.250 --> 15:45.130
Uh, no, she's so dedicated
to the Iron Sisters.

15:45.220 --> 15:47.640
When the Circle
disbanded, she had to be.

15:48.510 --> 15:50.350
She was a member of the Circle?

15:51.350 --> 15:52.980
[sighs] I didn't realize...

15:53.060 --> 15:56.110
And she worshipped Valentine,
followed him around like a little puppy.

15:56.180 --> 15:58.810
When I finally figured out
what Valentine was up to...

15:58.900 --> 16:00.240
I'd lost my sister for good.

16:00.310 --> 16:04.020
- We have to get her back, Luke.
- I don't know. It might be too late.

16:04.110 --> 16:08.910
No. We've lost so much.
Family is all we have.

16:08.990 --> 16:12.460
She's your sister, Luke.
Don't you wanna at least try?

16:16.200 --> 16:17.910
[thunder rumbling]

16:24.460 --> 16:26.960
- You're early.
- Really? I am?

16:27.630 --> 16:29.420
By about two hours.

16:29.510 --> 16:32.140
Well, um...
Well, you know how the F train is.

16:32.220 --> 16:34.800
Not to mention my horrible
sense of direction...

16:34.890 --> 16:36.706
- [stutters] I can come back.
- Oh, don't be silly.

16:36.730 --> 16:41.440
Just, um, grab a table and I will make
you one of my specialty cocktails.

16:42.360 --> 16:43.440
[mouths] Okay.

16:44.860 --> 16:46.620
[Isabelle] Long time no see.

16:46.690 --> 16:49.360
- Yeah.
- You staying out of trouble?

16:49.450 --> 16:51.370
Well, I haven't been
kidnapped in a while, so...

16:51.450 --> 16:53.650
- [chuckles] Quite an accomplishment.
- Yeah. [Chuckles]

16:54.910 --> 16:55.910
She's cute.

16:56.790 --> 16:58.130
[Simon] Um...

16:58.960 --> 17:01.340
- Yeah.
- There's nothing wrong with it.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.630
Right.
I'm just a little anxious.

17:03.710 --> 17:07.500
- You know what's great for anxiety?
- Aromatherapy. I read about it online.

17:08.210 --> 17:09.710
Shadowhunter blood.

17:10.550 --> 17:14.630
- Excuse me?
- One quick bite... Bye-bye anxiety.

17:15.430 --> 17:17.720
Do you mean, like, me bite you?

17:19.020 --> 17:20.480
With my fangs?

17:21.980 --> 17:23.569
[laughs]

17:24.520 --> 17:25.810
The look on your face.

17:25.900 --> 17:29.070
Oh. [Chuckling] Yeah, I bet...
I bet that was a good one.

17:29.150 --> 17:30.510
- [chuckles]
- [cell phone ringing]

17:33.780 --> 17:35.030
I should go.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.750
Okay. Well, it was...
It was great catching up with you.

17:40.040 --> 17:41.750
[thunder rumbling]

17:42.620 --> 17:45.016
[Luke] Told you, Clary.
I've used all the department's resources.

17:45.040 --> 17:46.500
There's no sign of her.

17:49.380 --> 17:50.880
[Cleophas breathing shakily]

17:55.850 --> 17:57.520
Luke.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.150
[grunting]

18:04.980 --> 18:06.230
Lucian...

18:06.310 --> 18:08.060
[Cleophas breathing heavily]

18:08.900 --> 18:10.230
Help me.

18:16.530 --> 18:18.950
- Bloody Mary?
- Minus the Mary.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.920
- Eternally underaged, remember?
- Ah.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.670
Yes.
Forever in need of a fake ID.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.010
Thank you for this.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.790
- Bottoms up.
- Mmm-hmm.

18:29.170 --> 18:31.170
Um, you got a little...

18:32.170 --> 18:33.540
Oh. I'm sorry. It's...

18:33.630 --> 18:36.190
- [grunts] I'm a spiller. I should have...
- It's fine. I got it.

18:36.220 --> 18:37.656
- Since I was a kid, orange juice, milk...
- I got it.

18:37.680 --> 18:38.770
- Hey. Hey.
- Cherries...

18:39.350 --> 18:41.150
- I got it. [Chuckles]
- Thank you.

18:44.640 --> 18:45.640
[Jace whistles]

18:46.400 --> 18:47.610
Smooth.

18:48.770 --> 18:50.600
Is this the only
bar in Brooklyn?

18:51.110 --> 18:53.030
Wow, you must have a death wish.

18:53.690 --> 18:55.690
Isn't it time we
kissed and made up?

18:55.780 --> 18:58.740
- Or I could just rip your face off.
- That's another way to go.

18:58.830 --> 19:01.000
Can I have four tequila
shots, please?

19:04.660 --> 19:07.040
Guess some girls are
immune to your charms, huh?

19:07.130 --> 19:09.340
You know, there's always
that one rare exception,

19:09.420 --> 19:10.550
- yeah.
- Hmm.

19:12.090 --> 19:13.260
Why are you here?

19:14.220 --> 19:16.180
- Book club.
- You read?

19:16.260 --> 19:18.100
Yeah. And so do they.

19:23.810 --> 19:24.820
[chuckles]

19:24.890 --> 19:27.560
You know, I didn't think hot-tempered
wolves were your type, Simon.

19:27.650 --> 19:30.650
- Maia? No, we're just, um...
- Friends.

19:30.730 --> 19:32.100
Shocking.

19:32.190 --> 19:34.980
It's the Simon Lewis sweet spot.
Just ask Clary.

19:35.070 --> 19:36.900
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means...

19:37.490 --> 19:39.040
you're the safe choice, Simon.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.716
You're non-threatening,
you're easy to talk to,

19:40.740 --> 19:43.570
- and you never seal the deal. Am I right?
- No.

19:43.660 --> 19:46.080
- [Jace] Thank you. Ooh.
- I spit in one.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.620
Delicious. Don't tease me.

19:48.670 --> 19:51.380
Maybe, but...
[sighs] What does it matter to you?

19:52.210 --> 19:57.050
I am willing to share some of my wisdom.
I'm feeling charitable.

19:57.130 --> 19:58.840
[scoffs] Like I
need your charity.

19:58.930 --> 20:02.600
You know, I'm perfectly capable of making
a good impression on my own, thank you.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.760
Oh. I like that confidence.

20:04.850 --> 20:05.850
[chuckles]

20:05.930 --> 20:07.470
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

20:10.520 --> 20:11.680
Wait.

20:13.110 --> 20:14.450
[sighs]

20:19.160 --> 20:20.790
Will you be my Obi-Wan?

20:21.740 --> 20:22.990
Who?

20:23.950 --> 20:25.700
Obi-Wan. From <i>Star Wars?</i>

20:25.790 --> 20:27.040
- It's a movie. It's...
- Yeah.

20:27.910 --> 20:29.370
Don't make me regret this.

20:36.550 --> 20:40.770
[Luke] Of all the places you could go,
you chose to ask a Downworlder for help?

20:41.340 --> 20:44.220
A soulless monster.
A filthy animal.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.690
Or have you forgotten all
the names you called me?

20:46.770 --> 20:48.270
- Because I haven't.
- Luke.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.990
[sighs] What happened
at the Citadel?

20:52.060 --> 20:54.020
Valentine's men infiltrated.

20:54.110 --> 20:55.510
We tried to fight them off.
They...

20:56.730 --> 20:58.560
They killed Magdalena
and took me.

20:58.650 --> 21:00.190
[scoffs] Only you?

21:00.950 --> 21:02.580
- Why is that?
- [Cleophas] I don't know.

21:02.660 --> 21:04.056
He brought me to New
York, locked me up.

21:04.080 --> 21:05.556
I managed to get a jump
on one of his guards

21:05.580 --> 21:06.790
and fight my way out.

21:06.870 --> 21:08.636
You can't seriously
expect us to believe that.

21:08.660 --> 21:11.370
- Luke, you're not helping.
- It's okay, Clarissa.

21:11.460 --> 21:13.260
I know where Valentine's hiding.

21:14.170 --> 21:15.510
I can lead you to him.

21:17.260 --> 21:19.100
[sighs] Luke,
we have to do this.

21:19.170 --> 21:21.340
- It's our chance to find Valentine.
- No way.

21:21.430 --> 21:23.816
I couldn't save your mom, but I'll
be damned if I put you in jeopardy.

21:23.840 --> 21:26.130
- If we could just discuss this...
- Not now, Clary.

21:26.220 --> 21:27.640
Please.

21:39.360 --> 21:40.570
[Luke] Look.

21:40.650 --> 21:43.650
I know my sister's convincing,
but you can't fall for her lies.

21:43.740 --> 21:45.500
She's not that convincing.

21:46.160 --> 21:48.290
I wasn't sure until
she called me Clarissa.

21:48.370 --> 21:50.210
Only Valentine calls me that.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.120
Well done.

21:53.210 --> 21:57.760
- Now, what the hell are they planning?
- That's what we have to figure out.

21:57.840 --> 22:00.510
Valentine has the Soul-Sword, Luke.
If she can lead us to him...

22:00.590 --> 22:01.920
Not happening.

22:02.010 --> 22:04.180
Well, isn't that what cops do?
Go undercover?

22:04.260 --> 22:06.760
- I didn't realize you had a badge.
- This is our chance

22:06.850 --> 22:09.060
to make Valentine pay
for what he did to Mom,

22:09.140 --> 22:11.430
- to stop him before he hurts anyone else.
- No.

22:11.520 --> 22:14.530
We're turning Cleo over to the Clave.
They have more resources.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.140
We need to do something now.

22:16.230 --> 22:18.310
If he has the Sword,
who knows what he'll do next.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.200
Clary, we'll find another way.

22:20.860 --> 22:24.280
I'm gonna go talk to the pack.
We're taking Cleo to the Institute.

22:24.860 --> 22:26.070
[Clary] Luke.

22:29.160 --> 22:30.320
[sighs]

22:31.620 --> 22:33.700
Why do you think women
are so attracted to me?

22:33.790 --> 22:36.380
Apart from the obvious.

22:36.460 --> 22:38.220
[Simon sighs] Okay, um...

22:39.630 --> 22:41.220
You literally slay demons.

22:41.880 --> 22:44.670
- All I have is fangs.
- The fangs don't matter.

22:45.390 --> 22:47.310
Look, you gotta stop
feeling sorry for yourself,

22:47.390 --> 22:49.020
and figure out what's...

22:49.720 --> 22:51.090
[sighs] lacking.

22:52.310 --> 22:54.440
Lacking? I'm lacking?

22:55.690 --> 22:56.820
Are you kidding?

22:58.020 --> 23:01.060
You know what, let's, uh...
Let's start at the top.

23:01.150 --> 23:02.150
Okay.

23:03.940 --> 23:05.280
- What?
- Your hair.

23:05.990 --> 23:07.750
What's wrong with my hair?

23:09.530 --> 23:11.280
You know,
we'll circle back to that.

23:11.370 --> 23:13.420
Why don't you just
start by telling me, uh,

23:13.500 --> 23:15.130
what you do when
you approach a girl.

23:15.710 --> 23:17.000
Okay. What do you mean?

23:19.250 --> 23:21.210
- You mean, like, act it out?
- Yeah.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.430
- Here?
- Dazzle me.

23:26.590 --> 23:27.920
Okay, um...

23:35.020 --> 23:38.690
I'm Lewis. Simon Lewis.

23:38.770 --> 23:40.100
No. Don't do that.

23:40.190 --> 23:41.310
- Do what?
- Any of that.

23:41.400 --> 23:42.586
This is my James
Bond impression.

23:42.610 --> 23:45.660
It's nothing like James Bond.
The face and the snap... No.

23:45.740 --> 23:47.870
Okay, so what am I supposed to do?
Like...

23:49.320 --> 23:52.030
- What is that?
- It's me being you. Dark. Mysterious.

23:52.120 --> 23:54.040
It looks like
you're low on fiber.

23:56.460 --> 23:58.340
Okay, I'll try again. Um...

24:03.590 --> 24:04.590
Perfect.

24:04.670 --> 24:06.190
- Mmm-hmm.
- If you're a serial killer.

24:06.760 --> 24:10.350
Look... [sighs] You gotta learn
to play hard to get, okay?

24:10.430 --> 24:12.730
No girl wants a guy with his
cards already on the table.

24:13.510 --> 24:16.930
- No girl wants a guy who can't shut up.
- [chuckles] I can shut up.

24:18.350 --> 24:21.180
[stuttering] So I...
I have to change my hair,

24:21.270 --> 24:24.060
stop talking, stop smiling.
Essentially, just...

24:24.150 --> 24:26.900
- stop being myself.
- Exactly.

24:28.320 --> 24:29.980
It's never gonna work.

24:34.870 --> 24:36.500
You wanna bet?

24:37.160 --> 24:39.120
Oh, dazzle me, please.

24:49.550 --> 24:51.210
What are you doing?

24:51.300 --> 24:52.900
Jace. What are you...
What are you doing?

25:22.250 --> 25:23.620
That's how it's done.

25:30.680 --> 25:32.430
[breathing heavily]

25:34.550 --> 25:35.630
Where have you been?

25:35.720 --> 25:39.850
Had to slaughter a horde of Shax demons
in Grand Central. Could've used your help.

25:40.810 --> 25:42.286
- What are you doing?
- [Isabelle] Uh...

25:42.310 --> 25:44.770
Aldertree has me on
a special assignment.

25:44.860 --> 25:47.110
I'm checking out
some rogue vamp dens.

25:49.030 --> 25:51.530
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

25:51.610 --> 25:53.360
- You don't seem fine.
- [Isabelle sighs]

25:55.530 --> 25:57.110
I'm... tired.

25:58.160 --> 26:02.490
Yeah. Um, your message
said you wanted to talk.

26:02.580 --> 26:04.450
Do you have a lead on Cleophas?

26:06.670 --> 26:08.470
No. Not yet.

26:11.170 --> 26:12.460
Then what is it?

26:14.930 --> 26:16.480
It's about Magnus.

26:19.930 --> 26:21.390
Look, um...

26:23.730 --> 26:24.820
[sighs]

26:24.900 --> 26:28.280
How do you know...
in your experience,

26:28.360 --> 26:31.740
you know, when's the, uh...
the right time?

26:33.820 --> 26:35.990
Oh, my God,
are you talking about having sex?

26:36.070 --> 26:40.780
Can you not discuss my sex life
with the entire Institute, please?

26:40.870 --> 26:42.660
Alec, is this your
first time with a man?

26:44.160 --> 26:45.620
Your first time ever?

26:46.880 --> 26:50.590
[chuckles] It all
makes sense now.

26:50.670 --> 26:53.170
That's why you didn't want
me to meet Jessica Hawkblue.

26:54.010 --> 26:57.600
- Wait, was there ever a Jessica Hawkblue?
- Are you done?

26:57.680 --> 26:59.270
Okay. [Sighs]

27:00.270 --> 27:01.980
You and Magnus...

27:03.270 --> 27:04.440
You want to...

27:05.440 --> 27:07.530
I think so. I don't know.

27:08.440 --> 27:12.950
Alec, you care about Magnus.
He cares about you. It's okay.

27:13.530 --> 27:16.120
- Just don't do what you always do.
- And what's that?

27:16.200 --> 27:17.910
Overthink it.

27:18.490 --> 27:21.320
- Like you're doing now.
- No, I don't overthink things.

27:22.790 --> 27:26.880
- Do I? [Sighs]
- Look...

27:26.960 --> 27:30.800
If it's what you want,
if it makes you happy...

27:30.880 --> 27:32.050
then go for it.

27:33.630 --> 27:35.090
[chuckles]

27:39.470 --> 27:40.510
[sighs]

27:48.100 --> 27:50.560
Pretty cold-blooded,
turning your sister over to the Clave.

27:50.650 --> 27:53.950
Remember that the next time the
pack tries to question my authority.

27:54.030 --> 27:55.870
Get ready. We leave in five.

28:01.990 --> 28:03.280
It's time.

28:03.870 --> 28:05.920
Kiddo, it'll be okay.

28:06.750 --> 28:09.510
You believe in what you're doing.
And so do I.

28:10.290 --> 28:11.870
[groans]

28:11.960 --> 28:13.750
[Clary] Let's go!

28:13.840 --> 28:15.140
[Luke grunting]

28:27.180 --> 28:28.180
[Maia sighs]

28:29.270 --> 28:31.780
I thought that shift would never end.
[chuckles]

28:33.020 --> 28:34.020
[sighs]

28:34.110 --> 28:38.700
Have you ever been around drunk Seelies?
It's, like, one shot and they're toast.

28:38.780 --> 28:40.380
And they won't stop
with the Abba songs.

28:41.030 --> 28:44.570
- I thought I was gonna lose my mind.
- Yeah. Bummer.

28:44.660 --> 28:48.200
- Wanna get out of here?
- Yeah. I hope you're a film buff.

28:49.290 --> 28:52.210
- I guess.
- BAM's doing a <i>Blade Runner</i> marathon.

28:52.290 --> 28:56.170
All three cuts.
And I checked, finishes before dawn.

28:58.050 --> 28:59.300
Are you expecting a call?

29:00.430 --> 29:01.890
Not necessarily.

29:07.850 --> 29:11.310
Did someone spike your blood supply?
'Cause you're acting really weird.

29:12.480 --> 29:13.770
Weird can be good.

29:15.780 --> 29:17.490
This isn't good.

29:17.570 --> 29:21.410
So, when the Simon I agreed to go
out with just decides to show up,

29:21.490 --> 29:23.500
- tell him to give me a call, okay?
- Wait, no.

29:23.570 --> 29:25.360
Maia! Maia, wait!

29:29.620 --> 29:30.790
[knock on door]

29:32.040 --> 29:33.040
[Magnus] Hmm.

29:37.250 --> 29:38.460
Hey.

29:39.510 --> 29:43.930
- [Alec] Jace here?
- No. He left hours ago. Are you okay?

29:45.100 --> 29:46.640
Mmm... Mmm... [chuckles]

29:47.600 --> 29:49.650
Hey, what's this all about?

29:49.730 --> 29:52.230
I mean, I'm not
complaining, but...

29:52.310 --> 29:53.640
I... I just thought...

29:53.730 --> 29:56.450
you know, I thought we
could take the next step.

29:57.940 --> 30:00.310
- The sex step.
- Yeah.

30:01.900 --> 30:03.070
Alexander.

30:03.990 --> 30:06.160
I may be experienced, but...

30:07.370 --> 30:10.380
it's rare that I've ever felt
this way about someone and...

30:12.580 --> 30:14.200
I worry that once we...

30:16.790 --> 30:18.540
That if we rush into this...

30:20.510 --> 30:22.430
That I may lose you.

30:22.510 --> 30:24.640
What? Why would you think that?

30:27.300 --> 30:28.590
Look...

30:29.600 --> 30:32.150
You're not the only one
that feels vulnerable.

30:33.190 --> 30:37.110
Magnus...
You have nothing to worry about.

30:38.190 --> 30:39.560
I want this.

30:45.780 --> 30:47.280
- You're gonna have to wait.
- Aw...

30:47.370 --> 30:49.580
Jace. We gotta go.

30:49.660 --> 30:52.990
Oh, let me guess. Alec sent you?
Tell him I'm off duty.

30:53.080 --> 30:54.950
It's Clary. She's in trouble.

31:01.170 --> 31:02.750
[thunder rumbling]

31:02.840 --> 31:05.460
- Where are we going, exactly?
- We're close.

31:06.300 --> 31:09.130
You realize by going against
Valentine, you're risking your life?

31:10.260 --> 31:11.930
He'll never forgive
you for this.

31:12.020 --> 31:14.480
I have to make amends.

31:14.560 --> 31:16.770
- [distorted screaming]
- [gasping]

31:20.610 --> 31:22.280
[grunting]

31:23.650 --> 31:26.440
Clary! What is it? What's wrong?

31:27.780 --> 31:29.190
[grunting]

31:32.620 --> 31:34.490
- [grunts]
- What are you doing to me?

31:34.580 --> 31:37.750
- Let go.
- [shakily] The sound in my head.

31:38.460 --> 31:40.930
- It's coming from Valentine, isn't it?
- What sound?

31:41.000 --> 31:44.630
- [gasping] It's getting louder!
- Activate my hearing rune. There.

31:47.130 --> 31:48.960
[distorted screaming continues]

31:50.510 --> 31:52.840
- It's not possible.
- What is it?

31:52.930 --> 31:57.520
- Tell me! What is Valentine doing to me?
- It's not Valentine.

31:58.440 --> 31:59.740
It is an angel.

32:01.270 --> 32:03.940
- Angel?
- Here on earth.

32:04.030 --> 32:06.370
I think he's
holding him captive.

32:09.280 --> 32:11.530
The angel is crying
out for help.

32:11.620 --> 32:13.210
[breathing heavily]

32:17.870 --> 32:19.370
Valentine...

32:20.960 --> 32:22.250
how could you?

32:25.340 --> 32:26.800
[distorted screaming]

32:40.520 --> 32:41.730
[groaning]

32:44.690 --> 32:47.440
This is your chance to
show your true form.

32:49.070 --> 32:52.280
Together we will right all
of the wrongs, Ithuriel.

33:02.540 --> 33:05.460
His cry is so full of pain.

33:06.380 --> 33:10.760
You said angels were rare,
that almost no one had ever seen one.

33:10.840 --> 33:12.340
It's unheard of.

33:12.430 --> 33:15.110
Iron Sisters hear the angels whisper
when we're forging our weapons,

33:15.140 --> 33:16.730
but even we've never seen one.

33:18.140 --> 33:19.600
To communicate with one,

33:20.520 --> 33:22.480
you must be blessed
by the angels.

33:22.560 --> 33:25.940
- [Clary scoffs]
- Clary... you are blessed.

33:26.030 --> 33:27.740
No more lies, Cleophas.

33:28.650 --> 33:30.780
I know you're working
with Valentine.

33:33.780 --> 33:35.950
You killed Magdalena,
didn't you?

33:37.290 --> 33:38.290
[sniffles]

33:40.460 --> 33:42.710
I loved Magdalena.
I thought Valentine...

33:42.790 --> 33:46.290
I thought his way was the only way
to make the world a better place.

33:46.380 --> 33:47.430
A safer place.

33:48.460 --> 33:51.250
No matter what sacrifices
had to be made, but...

33:52.510 --> 33:56.890
harming an angel,
holding him captive...

33:56.970 --> 33:59.300
That goes against
everything we believe in.

33:59.390 --> 34:03.310
- What, and killing Downworlders doesn't?
- You don't understand.

34:03.400 --> 34:04.820
An angel is...

34:06.520 --> 34:08.400
pure goodness.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.110
They're the embodiment of
what Shadowhunters stand for.

34:11.199 --> 34:15.540
If Valentine's harming an angel,
then everything we love will be destroyed.

34:15.620 --> 34:19.830
You know, Luke is right.
You are not a Shadowhunter.

34:19.909 --> 34:21.739
You are a traitor.

34:22.790 --> 34:25.750
- You're the Clave's problem now.
- No! Please.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.590
Let me take you to Valentine.

34:27.670 --> 34:29.580
We have to free the angel.

34:30.380 --> 34:31.960
Then I'll turn myself in.

34:32.679 --> 34:36.850
- No, why... why help me now?
- Don't you see the storm coming?

34:38.350 --> 34:42.060
If Valentine has the angel
and a bolt of lightning...

34:42.139 --> 34:44.889
- He can activate the Soul-Sword.
- [lightning crackling]

34:50.690 --> 34:52.505
Cleo, you hurt her,
I'll drop you where you stand.

34:52.530 --> 34:54.620
- Wait, no!
- Clary, get out of the way!

34:54.699 --> 34:57.370
Luke, don't! We need her.

35:11.760 --> 35:13.390
[Eloise] Smells
like Shadowhunter.

35:14.550 --> 35:18.270
No need to worry.
I'm not here on official business.

35:18.350 --> 35:21.730
And what other kind of business
do people like you have?

35:26.520 --> 35:28.770
Looking a little
under the weather.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.950
There's just something I need.

35:44.910 --> 35:48.580
The ultimate five-disc collector's
edition of <i>Blade Runner.</i>

35:48.670 --> 35:53.010
<i>Final Cut</i> is, like...
my favorite film of all time...

35:53.880 --> 35:57.500
which is what I...
what I should have said to you.

35:57.590 --> 35:59.840
- But you didn't.
- No.

35:59.930 --> 36:01.600
Instead I acted like a...

36:02.310 --> 36:03.520
A replicant?

36:03.600 --> 36:05.940
[chuckles] I did, didn't I?

36:07.390 --> 36:10.680
And that sucks 'cause you're
smart and you're funny,

36:10.770 --> 36:13.560
and you get what it's
like to be a Downworlder.

36:14.150 --> 36:17.900
And all I wanted to do tonight was
prove to myself that I'm not...

36:17.990 --> 36:20.120
In love with your best friend?

36:21.410 --> 36:25.130
- Not where I thought this was going.
- But it's the truth, right?

36:25.200 --> 36:27.410
You're in love with Clary.

36:27.500 --> 36:29.050
[sighs]

36:29.120 --> 36:30.120
How do you know?

36:30.210 --> 36:34.470
I have superior instincts for
these sort of things, and...

36:34.550 --> 36:36.510
I also have ears of a wolf.

36:36.590 --> 36:38.050
I hear everything.

36:39.130 --> 36:41.970
- My conversation with Jace...
- Pretty much every word.

36:42.050 --> 36:43.050
[softly] Yeah.

36:44.640 --> 36:46.810
He brings out the worst in
me, at times.

36:46.890 --> 36:52.390
[grunts] I knew it from the moment you
said something about "best friend."

36:53.520 --> 36:55.230
Look, here's an idea.

36:56.150 --> 36:58.520
Instead of trying to
go out with other girls

36:58.610 --> 37:02.530
just to prove something to yourself,
why not just tell Clary how you feel?

37:04.410 --> 37:05.650
Luke said to do the same thing.

37:05.700 --> 37:08.950
[chuckles] We're
highly evolved beings.

37:09.870 --> 37:15.170
What if I tell Clary and...
it ruins our friendship?

37:15.250 --> 37:16.330
What if you don't?

37:17.260 --> 37:19.890
What if she falls in love
with some Shadowhunter,

37:19.970 --> 37:24.600
and you spend eternity obsessing
over how stupid you were?

37:24.680 --> 37:27.000
Well, you know, when you put it like
that, it... [chuckles]

37:29.480 --> 37:30.690
So, are we, um...

37:31.520 --> 37:33.730
- We're cool.
- Cool.

37:34.730 --> 37:36.650
But I'm keeping this.

37:44.990 --> 37:47.740
Cleophas, did you find Clarissa?

37:47.830 --> 37:50.670
I did. And I was right.

37:51.250 --> 37:52.630
She is gifted.

37:53.540 --> 37:56.920
There are things she showed me
I didn't know were possible.

37:57.590 --> 38:00.510
So... where is she?

38:00.590 --> 38:02.350
[Luke] I'm afraid she's
a little preoccupied.

38:04.300 --> 38:05.550
[both grunting]

38:14.520 --> 38:16.310
Let her go.
This isn't her fight.

38:17.440 --> 38:18.770
It is now.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.056
If Valentine needs lightning
to activate the Sword,

38:26.080 --> 38:27.760
he probably put Ithuriel
up on the rooftop.

38:27.830 --> 38:29.350
Cleophas could have been
lying, Clary.

38:29.410 --> 38:30.490
She's not. Not about this.

38:30.580 --> 38:32.840
- How do you know?
- I just know. Trust me.

38:42.800 --> 38:44.390
[grunting]

38:56.730 --> 38:58.440
[all grunting]

39:07.120 --> 39:08.410
[yells]

39:17.420 --> 39:18.550
[groans]

39:26.260 --> 39:29.260
I can't believe you were stupid
enough to let Ithuriel go,

39:29.350 --> 39:31.696
when we were so close to achieving
everything that we wanted.

39:31.720 --> 39:35.720
- I never wanted this. To torture an angel?
- It isn't torture! It's a means to an end.

39:35.810 --> 39:38.640
I can't believe that you
are siding with this dog.

39:38.730 --> 39:40.126
[Cleophas] Lucian may
be a Downworlder now,

39:40.150 --> 39:41.916
- but he has more honor than you ever will.
- [scoffs]

39:41.940 --> 39:43.270
I said let her go.

39:43.360 --> 39:45.216
You Graymarks never see
the bigger picture, do you?

39:45.240 --> 39:46.386
What's the bigger picture, Val?

39:46.410 --> 39:49.250
Lying to your followers,
killing the woman you love,

39:49.320 --> 39:51.160
destroying your
children piece by piece?

39:51.240 --> 39:53.530
Sentimentality has always
been your biggest weakness.

39:53.620 --> 39:56.370
- Maybe you've changed, huh?
- [grunts]

39:56.460 --> 40:00.760
Go ahead, Lucian.
Put a bullet in me... <i>parabatai.</i>

40:00.840 --> 40:02.436
- Don't you dare call me that.
- [Valentine] Why not?

40:02.460 --> 40:04.380
Because it reminds
you of your betrayal?

40:04.460 --> 40:07.000
How you stole Jocelyn and
turned her against me?

40:07.090 --> 40:09.550
You did that on your own.
You killed innocent people.

40:09.640 --> 40:12.600
No. No,
no one is innocent in war.

40:12.680 --> 40:16.100
If only I'd thought to bring a blade
of silver, we could have ended this.

40:16.190 --> 40:18.190
End it now, Lucian.
Pull the trigger!

40:18.270 --> 40:19.640
[Valentine] But once you do,

40:19.730 --> 40:23.860
think about what will happen
to your sweet baby sister.

40:25.530 --> 40:26.580
[Valentine sighs]

40:26.650 --> 40:29.900
- You were always so spineless.
- No!

40:29.990 --> 40:31.910
[grunting]

40:34.080 --> 40:35.330
Damn it!

40:36.290 --> 40:37.540
We have to hurry.

40:41.500 --> 40:43.670
[grunting]

40:43.750 --> 40:46.340
- Nothing's working.
- Why can't we break the chain?

40:46.420 --> 40:49.710
I don't know. Valentine must have used
a warlock, some kind of dark magic.

40:49.800 --> 40:51.800
- [grunting]
- [distorted screaming]

40:59.390 --> 41:00.456
What's happening?
What are you doing?

41:00.480 --> 41:01.860
He's communicating with me.

41:01.940 --> 41:02.990
He's...

41:41.440 --> 41:42.820
[Clary] What was that?
