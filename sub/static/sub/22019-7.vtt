WHERE THEY WERE LAST SEEN.

BADLY DISFIGURED.

A WHITE PLASTIC MASK

04:22.830 --> 04:24.980
ON THE PASSENGER SEAT
OF BOTH OF THEIR CARS.

04:25.030 --> 04:27.794

HAVE BEEN SLICED

04:27.830 --> 04:29.798
AND ABRADED SEVERAL TIMES.

04:29.830 --> 04:33.539
WHAT'S THAT SAYING,
"DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS"?

04:33.570 --> 04:35.868

OF TORTURE AND EXECUTION

IN DEATH.

THESE WOMEN ALIVE.

04:44.580 --> 04:46.775

ON MAKING THEM LIVE
WITH THEIR SCARS.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.549

TAKEN TIME.

TO SLOWLY AND PERMANENTLY

04:51.750 --> 04:52.887

04:52.920 --> 04:55.957
TO TAKE AWAY THEIR BEAUTY,
THEIR IDENTITIES.

04:55.990 --> 04:58.754

OF THE WOMEN

OR WHERE THEY HAD BEEN.

CONFIRMS THEIR
ORIGINAL WHEREABOUTS,

05:08.570 --> 05:10.606
AND THEN GOES OFFLINE
UNTIL THEY RESURFACED.

05:10.640 --> 05:11.868
IT'S HARD TO TELL FROM
THESE INITIAL PHOTOS,

05:11.910 --> 05:13.832
BUT HANNAH'S INJURIES,
THOUGH EXTENSIVE,

05:13.880 --> 05:15.836

SEEM MORE SUPERFICIAL.

07:06.990 --> 07:10.619
YEAH. YEAH, I, UH...

07:10.660 --> 07:13.151
I WENT TO VISIT
MY OLD PARTNER THIS MORNING.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.191
HIS DOCTORS THOUGHT
HE'D BE PARALYZED

07:15.230 --> 07:16.993
PERMANENTLY
FROM THE WAIST DOWN.

07:17.030 --> 07:18.725
JUST ABOUT A YEAR AGO
HE GOT SOME FEELING

07:18.770 --> 07:20.965
IN HIS TOES AND HE WAS
EVEN ABLE TO TAKE A FEW STEPS,

07:21.000 --> 07:24.106
BUT HE JUST IS...

07:24.140 --> 07:25.107
HE'S PLATEAUED.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.778
PHIL WAS THERE FOR ME.

07:26.810 --> 07:28.778
RANGER SCHOOL,

07:28.810 --> 07:30.607
WHILE WE SERVED IN
THE 75th,

07:30.650 --> 07:33.949
AND WE EVEN CAME INTO
THE BUREAU AT THE SAME TIME.

07:33.980 --> 07:36.073
HE WAS MY BROTHER.

07:37.220 --> 07:39.654
IT'S JUST TOUGH TO SEE HIM
STRUGGLING LIKE THIS.

07:39.690 --> 07:41.214
WELL, THE ROAD TO
RECOVERY'S TOUGH.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.989
YOU AND I
BOTH KNOW THAT.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.919
I'M JUST WISHING
THERE WAS SOMETHING
I COULD DO TO HELP.

07:45.960 --> 07:47.951
OH, THERE IS.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.061
JUST KNOWING WHAT THAT IS
IS THE REAL QUESTION, RIGHT?

07:55.000 --> 07:58.003
SO BOTH VICTIMS WERE
WOMEN IN THEIR EARLY 30$.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.576
HANNAH,
THE FIRST VICTIM,

07:59.610 --> 08:01.009
IS A SINGLE MOM
WITH 3 KIDS.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.007
SHE'S FROM AUSTIN,

08:02.040 --> 08:04.201
WORKS FROM HOME
AS A CPA.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.002
AND SHE WAS LAST SEEN
HAVING LUNCH

08:06.050 --> 08:07.017
WITH A FRIEND
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

08:07.050 --> 08:08.745
THE FRIEND WENT
BACK TO WORK,

08:08.780 --> 08:10.714
BUT HANNAH NEVER
RETURNED HOME.

08:10.750 --> 08:13.014
HER MOM, WHO WAS WATCHING
HER KIDS, CALLED THE POLICE.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.813
LIZ MEYER, ON THE OTHER HAND,
MOVED TO AUSTIN 6 MONTHS AGO

08:15.860 --> 08:17.054
AND WAS LAST SEEN LEAVING WORK.

08:17.090 --> 08:18.921
AND THESE TWO WOMEN
DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER?

08:18.960 --> 08:20.951
NOT AS FAR AS I CAN SEE
AND I CAN SEE REALLY FAR.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.968
I LOOKED INTO ALL THEIR FORMER
BOYFRIENDS, GIRLFRIENDS,

08:23.000 --> 08:24.592
HUSBANDS, LOVERS,
ET CETERA.

08:24.630 --> 08:26.063
NOTHING'S TRIPPING MY ALARMS.

08:26.100 --> 08:28.534
THEN HANNAH AND LIZ LOOK LIKE
VICTIMS OF OPPORTUNITY.

08:28.570 --> 08:30.037
WHICH IS ODD, GIVEN
THE TIME THE UNSUB TOOK

08:30.070 --> 08:31.799
TO REPEATEDLY CUT
AND ABRADE THEIR SKIN.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.102
I MEAN, IT FEELS PERSONAL.

08:33.140 --> 08:35.074
SO MAYBE THEY'RE SURROGATES.

08:35.110 --> 08:36.668
THERE'S AN ELEMENT
OF SPECTACLE TO THIS,

08:36.710 --> 08:38.746
ALMOST LIKE THESE
WOMEN AREN'T SURROGATES,

08:38.780 --> 08:40.042
BUT STATEMENTS.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.071
SO WHAT'S
HE TRYING TO SAY?

08:42.120 --> 08:44.111
I HATE WOMEN?

08:44.150 --> 08:45.845
WHEN WE LAND, REID, JJ,
GO TO THE HOSPITAL,

08:45.890 --> 08:47.812
SEE WHAT WE CAN
FIND OUT FROM LIZ.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.055
LUKE, MATT, TAKE HANNAH
THROUGH A COGNITIVE.

08:50.090 --> 08:52.991
DAVE AND I WILL GO
TO THE DISPOSITION SITE
WHERE LIZ WAS FOUND.

08:53.030 --> 08:56.295
AUSTIN PD
IS HOLDING THE SCENE.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.060
CHIEF FOLES,
I'M SSA LUKE ALVEZ,

09:05.110 --> 09:06.771
THIS IS SSA MATT SIMMONS.

09:06.810 --> 09:08.004
PLEASURE.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.746
WE GOT YOU SET UP
IN THE BACK HERE.

09:09.780 --> 09:12.169
WE'RE STILL WORKING
ON PULLING THE TRAFFIC
CAM FOOTAGE

09:12.210 --> 09:14.314
OF THE SURROUNDING
ABDUCT ION AND, UH, DIS--

09:14.350 --> 09:15.942
WHAT'D YOU CALL IT?

09:15.980 --> 09:17.618
DISPOSITION SITE.
IT'S A TERM WE USE

09:17.650 --> 09:20.653
FOR A LOCATION WHERE
A VICTIM IS LEFT ALIVE.

09:20.690 --> 09:21.987
WELL, WE'VE ALSO
LOOKED INTO THE MASKS

09:22.020 --> 09:23.328
THAT WERE FOUND
IN HANNAH AND LIZ'S CARS.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.180
NO PRINTS, GENERIC.

09:25.230 --> 09:27.221
AVAILABLE IN COSTUME SHOPS
AND ONLINE.

09:27.260 --> 09:28.989
I KNOW SHE'S BEEN
RECOVERING AT HOME.

09:29.030 --> 09:31.590
HAVE YOU ARRANGED FOR HANNAH
ACCORD TO COME SPEAK WITH US?

09:31.630 --> 09:32.995
SHE'S ON HER WAY IN.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.691
THAN KS.

09:36.770 --> 09:38.306
MS. MEYER'S ROOM
IS THIS WAY.

09:38.340 --> 09:40.035
SHE'S SEDATED. WE NEEDED
TO CLEAN HER WOUNDS

09:40.080 --> 09:42.036
AND SHE WAS
IN A LOT OF PAIN.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.173
IN THE PHOTOS, IT APPEARS
AS THOUGH HER ATTACKER

09:44.210 --> 09:45.768
CUT AWAY THE FIRST
DERMAL LAYER OF SKIN.

09:45.810 --> 09:47.914
THAT'S CORRECT. AND PRETTY
CONSISTENTLY, TOO,

09:47.950 --> 09:49.076
I MIGHT ADD.

09:49.120 --> 09:50.644
THE PRECISION SUGGESTS

09:50.690 --> 09:51.714
SOMEONE SKILLED
WITH A KNIFE,

09:51.750 --> 09:52.910
MAYBE A PLASTIC SURGEON,

09:52.960 --> 09:56.179
A BUTCHER, A CRAFTSMAN,
OR AN ARTIST.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.653
LET ME ASK YOU THIS,
WHAT DO YOU MAKE

09:57.690 --> 09:58.884
OF THESE TWO PUNCTURE
WOUNDS ON HER CHEST?

09:58.930 --> 10:00.056
MY GUESS IS
THEY MIGHT BE DARTS

10:00.100 --> 10:01.988
FROM A STUN GUN OR A TASER.

10:02.030 --> 10:05.090
COULD HAVE BEEN USED
TO SUBDUE HER.

10:05.130 --> 10:07.269
SHE REPORT HAVING A METALLIC
TASTE IN HER MOUTH?

10:07.300 --> 10:09.097
YEAH, SHE DID, ACTUALLY.

10:09.140 --> 10:11.199
PROBABLY ADRENALINE.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.673
WHY? WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING, SPENCE?

10:12.710 --> 10:14.701
STUN GUN DARTS TEND
TO HAVE A WIDER RADIUS

10:14.740 --> 10:16.879
AND LEAVE BURN MARKS.
AND IF IT'S ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU, DR. BATEMAN,

10:16.910 --> 10:18.275
I'D LIKE TO ORDER A FEW
ADDITIONAL BLOOD TESTS.

10:18.310 --> 10:19.709
OK.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.240
SO, A PTT, AN APTT,
ALONG WITH FDP

10:21.280 --> 10:24.044
AND CREATININE KINASE,
CREATININE CALCIUM, P.O. 4

10:24.090 --> 10:25.910
AND CK SERUM, AS WELL AS
A TYPE AND SCREEN

10:25.950 --> 10:27.156
AND ELECT ROLYTES
TO START WITH.

10:27.190 --> 10:29.385
AGENT JAREAU INTRODUCED YOU
AS DR. REID,

10:29.420 --> 10:31.126
BUT I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WERE A MEDICAL DOCTOR.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.048
OH, I'M NOT.

10:43.740 --> 10:46.436
OHH. LOOK LIKE VOMIT
TO YOU?

10:46.470 --> 10:49.132
SOMEBODY CHUCKED
THEIR LUNCH?

10:49.180 --> 10:51.148
BUT LIZ'S TOX SCREEN
CAME BACK CLEAN.

10:51.180 --> 10:52.875
THOUGH SHE MIGHT HAVE
BEEN SICK.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.717
THAT WOULD MAKE HER
VULNERABLE,

10:54.750 --> 10:56.342
EASIER TO CONTROL.

10:56.380 --> 10:57.916
SO HOW DOES HE DO IT?

10:57.950 --> 11:00.282
HANNAH AN LIZ WERE FOUND
IN THEIR OWN VEHICLES.

11:00.320 --> 11:03.289
SO DOES THE UNSUB
USE HIS VICTIMS' CARS

11:03.330 --> 11:05.787
TO ABDUCT AND TRANSPORT THEM?

11:05.830 --> 11:06.956
WELL, LET'S SAY HE DOES,

11:07.000 --> 11:08.353
FOR CONVENIENCE SAKE.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.129
DOES HE APPROACH THEM

11:10.170 --> 11:11.728
WHILE THEY'RE
GETTING IN THE CAR?

11:11.770 --> 11:14.068
OR DOES HE FORCE THEM IN
USING THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE?

11:14.100 --> 11:15.738
OR DOES HE HAVE
SOME SORT OF RUSE?

11:15.770 --> 11:17.328
WELL, IT WAS A HOT DAY.

11:17.370 --> 11:19.304
LIZ COULD HAVE CRACKED
THE WINDOWS,

11:19.340 --> 11:22.173
WHICH GAVE THE UNSUB ACCESS
WHERE HE LAYS IN WAIT

11:22.210 --> 11:27.273
TO PICK JUST THE RIGHT
TIME TO STRIKE.

11:29.220 --> 11:31.939
HANNAH, THANKS
FOR COMING IN.

11:31.990 --> 11:36.154
YOU TOLD THE POLICE
YOU HAD TROUBLE
REMEMBERING THE ATTACK.

11:36.190 --> 11:38.249
THAT'S PERFECT LY NORMAL.

11:38.290 --> 11:41.259
WE'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU THROUGH
AN ENHANCED INTERVIEW,

11:41.300 --> 11:42.858
SOMETHING WE CALL
A COGNITIVE.

11:42.900 --> 11:45.198
WE'LL WALK YOU THROUGH
YOUR ABDUCTION

11:45.230 --> 11:48.165
BY FOCUSING ON DETAILS
THAT AT FIRST MIGHT SEEM

11:48.200 --> 11:51.806
INNOCUOUS OR UNIMPORTANT,
BUT THEY SHOULD UNLOCK
YOUR MEMORIES.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.206
I'LL DO EVERYTHING I CAN
TO HELP YOU CATCH HIM.

11:56.950 --> 12:00.875
TO STOP HIM FROM
HURTING ANYONE ELSE.

12:06.990 --> 12:10.357
SIMMONS: WHY DON'T YOU
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

12:10.390 --> 12:13.996
LET'S START WITH
WHAT YOU DO REMEMBER.

12:14.030 --> 12:17.193
YOU HAD LUNCH WITH A FRIEND.

12:17.230 --> 12:19.369
ALVEZ: THEN YOU WALKED
TO YOUR CAR.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.289
WHAT WAS THE TEMPERATURE LIKE?

12:22.340 --> 12:24.399
IT WAS HOT.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.772
IT'S ALWAYS HOT.
IT'S TEXAS.

12:26.810 --> 12:29.176
MY CAR'S GOING TO BE
UNBEARABLE,

12:29.210 --> 12:31.349
EVEN THOUGH I LEFT
THE WINDOWS CRACKED.

12:31.380 --> 12:33.314
SIMMONS: AND SO YOU
GOT IN YOUR CAR.

12:33.350 --> 12:36.171
I GOT IN.
I LEFT THE DOOR OPEN

12:36.220 --> 12:38.438
SO THE HEAT COULD GET OUT.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.927
THEN I STARTED THE CAR.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.359
[ENGINE STARTS]

12:47.400 --> 12:50.324
THE RADIO CAME ON,
BUT I TURNED IT OFF.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.291
ALVEZ: AND WHY DID YOU
TURN IT OFF?

12:51.330 --> 12:53.434
I THOUGHT I HEARD SOMETHING
BEFORE IT CAME ON.

12:53.470 --> 12:55.791
CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE SOUND?

12:55.840 --> 12:57.262
IT WAS A HISSING SOUND.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.301
SIMMONS: LIKE
A MECHANICAL HISSING?

12:59.340 --> 13:02.138
I THOUGHT IT WAS
THE RADIATOR OR SOMETHING.

13:02.180 --> 13:04.774
ALVEZ: OK. WHAT
DID YOU DO NEXT?

13:06.510 --> 13:08.876
I DON'T--

13:08.920 --> 13:11.138
I...DON'T REMEMBER.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.408
SIMMONS: IT'S OK.
IT'S FINE.

13:13.460 --> 13:17.226
LET'S JUST TAKE
A DEEP BREATH.

13:17.260 --> 13:20.423
NOW LET'S CLOSE
YOUR EYES.

13:20.460 --> 13:23.190
NOW, DID YOU
PUT YOUR SEATBELT ON?

13:23.230 --> 13:25.027
YES.

13:25.070 --> 13:29.268
AND THEN I PUT THE CAR
IN REVERSE...

13:29.300 --> 13:30.267
AAH!

13:30.310 --> 13:32.164
OH, MY GOD.

13:33.440 --> 13:35.203
AAH!

13:35.240 --> 13:36.605
AAH!

13:36.640 --> 13:38.972
IT'S WHAT I SUSPECT ED.
LIZ'S BLOOD TESTS

13:39.010 --> 13:40.375
SHOWED SIGNS OF EVENOMATION.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.309
SO THE PUNCTURE WOUNDS
WERE FROM A SNAKE BITE.

13:43.350 --> 13:45.238
THE QUICK ONSET OF SYMPTOMS,
THE MENTAL FOG,

13:45.290 --> 13:46.484
BLURRED VISION,
MUSCULAR PARALYSIS,

13:46.520 --> 13:48.010
ALONG WITH VOMITING
AND A COMPLETE LACK

13:48.060 --> 13:49.516
OF LOCALIZED SWELLING
AND NECROSIS

13:49.560 --> 13:52.222
SUGGESTS A NEUROTOXIC VENOM,
MAYBE FROM A VIPERINE

13:52.260 --> 13:53.249
OR SOMETHING IN
THE ELAPID FAMILY.

13:53.300 --> 13:56.098
IN FACT, THE SHALLOW
PUNCTURE WOUNDS AND SHORT BITE

13:56.130 --> 13:59.167
COULD INDICATE A BITE
FROM BITIS ATROPOS
OR PSEUDONAJA TEXT ILIS.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.292
ENGLISH, KID.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.400
THE BERG ADDER
AND THE EASTERN BROWN SNAKE,

14:03.440 --> 14:05.260
NEITHER OF WHICH ARE
INDIGENOUS TO NORTH AMERICA.

14:05.310 --> 14:07.369
WAIT, ISN'T A BITE FROM
THE EASTERN BROWN SNAKE FATAL?

14:07.410 --> 14:09.571
I MEAN, THE UNSUB
WOULD NEED TO HAVE
THE ANTI-VENOM ON HAND.

14:09.610 --> 14:11.601
NOT NECESSARILY.
THE EASTERN BROWN SNAKE

14:11.650 --> 14:13.470
IS THE SECOND-MOST
DEADLY SNAKE IN THE WORLD,

14:13.520 --> 14:15.374
BUT ITS BITES TEND
TO PRODUCE A RELATIVELY

14:15.420 --> 14:18.048
LOW VOLUME OF VENOM,
SO THOUGH FAST-ACTING
AND DEBILITATING,

14:18.090 --> 14:19.387
ITS MORTALITY RATE
IS RATHER LOW.

14:19.420 --> 14:22.218
SO THE UNSUB'S RUSE
IS TO TRAP HIS VICTIMS

14:22.260 --> 14:24.649
IN THEIR OWN CAR
WITH A VENOMOUS SNAKE

14:24.690 --> 14:28.558
AND LET IT BITE THEM
UNTIL THEY BECOME
INCAPACITATED.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.966
I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S
LEAVING A LOT TO CHANCE.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.265
THIS GUY COULD HAVE USED
ANY NUMBER OF ABDUCTION RUSES.

14:34.300 --> 14:36.461
THE FACT THAT HE CHOSE
A SNAKE SAYS A LOT.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.468
OK, WAIT, IS IT EVEN
LEGAL TO OWN

14:38.510 --> 14:40.501
THE SECOND-MOST DEADLY
SNAKE IN THE WORLD?

14:40.540 --> 14:42.007
I MEAN,
I'M HOPING IT ISN'T.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.200
WELL, MOST STATES REQUIRE
YOU HAVE A PERMIT

14:43.250 --> 14:45.343
TO KEEP AN EXOTIC
OR VENOMOUS REPTILE.

14:45.380 --> 14:47.519
THE REAL QUESTION IS,
WHAT DOES THIS ELABORATE

14:47.550 --> 14:50.485
ABDUCT ION SCENARIO
AND THE USE OF A SNAKE

14:50.520 --> 14:53.114
HAVE TO DO WITH
THE DISFIGUREMENT
OF THESE WOMEN?

14:53.160 --> 14:55.048
THEY OVERLAP
IN THE UNSUB'S MIND.

14:55.090 --> 14:58.082
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
HOW AND WHY AND WE NEED
TO DO THAT QUICKLY.

15:16.110 --> 15:19.238
[WHIMPERING, CRYING OUT]

15:19.280 --> 15:21.646
NO, NO...

15:21.680 --> 15:22.669
[WHIMPERING]

15:22.720 --> 15:24.449
AAH...STOP!

15:24.490 --> 15:28.984
[GASPING]

15:31.760 --> 15:32.454
AAH!

15:38.070 --> 15:39.196
HER NAME IS TRICIA SMOOTS.

15:39.230 --> 15:40.538
SHE WAS FOUND
EARLY THIS MORNING

15:40.570 --> 15:42.037
IN A NEIGHBORHOOD
IN SOUTHEAST AUSTIN.

15:42.070 --> 15:44.231
SHE HAS THE SAME
CUTS AND ABRASIONS

15:44.270 --> 15:45.999
AS THE PREVIOUS TWO VICTIMS,

15:46.040 --> 15:48.076
BUT HE WENT FURTHER
THIS TIME.

15:48.110 --> 15:49.737
FRENULUM WAS CUT
AND HER TONGUE WAS FORKED.

15:49.780 --> 15:52.203
PROBABLY WITH A SCALPEL
OR A RAZOR BLADE.

15:52.250 --> 15:55.344
SPLIT TONGUE.
LIKE THE SNAKE HE USES
TO ABDUCT THEM.

15:55.380 --> 15:57.644
NOW, SHE CAN'T SPEAK
BECAUSE OF THE SWELLING.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.385
AND SHE NEEDS TO REST,

15:59.420 --> 16:03.720
SO TRY AND KEEP IT SHORT.

16:03.760 --> 16:06.558
LISTEN, SMOOTS IS A NURSE.

16:06.590 --> 16:07.591
SHE USED TO WORK HERE.

16:07.630 --> 16:11.361
EVERYONE KNOWS
AND LOVES HER.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.664
CATCH THIS BASTARD.

16:18.140 --> 16:19.698
HI, TRICIA.

16:19.740 --> 16:21.708
I'M SSA JENNIFER JAREAU.

16:21.740 --> 16:23.241
THIS IS DR. SPENCER REID.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.702
WE'RE WITH THE FBI.

16:24.750 --> 16:25.705
WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS,

16:25.750 --> 16:28.014
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

16:30.650 --> 16:34.313
YOU CAN WRITE OR DRAW.

16:34.360 --> 16:38.979
JUST TELL US WHATEVER
YOU CAN REMEMBER.

16:42.830 --> 16:46.698
REID: "TIED DOWN. DIZZY."

16:50.310 --> 16:51.629
"LIKE A NIGHTMARE."

16:51.670 --> 16:54.673
DID YOUR ATTACKER
SAY ANYTHING?

16:57.410 --> 16:59.776
"WHISPERED. . ."

17:01.520 --> 17:03.647
"WE ARE NOW THE SAME."

17:03.690 --> 17:05.282
WE.

17:12.590 --> 17:17.721
THE PERSON THAT ATTACKED YOU
HAD A FORKED TONGUE, TOO.

17:17.770 --> 17:21.729
WE THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
OUR UNSUB MAY ALSO
HAVE A SPLIT TONGUE.

17:21.770 --> 17:23.738
THE REMOVAL OF THE FIRST
DERMAL LAYER OF SKIN

17:23.770 --> 17:25.704
IS SIMILAR TO A TECHNIQUE
USED IN SCARIFICATION,

17:25.740 --> 17:27.230
WHICH, LIKE TONGUE-SPLITTING,

17:27.280 --> 17:29.077
IS A POPULAR FORM
OF BODY MODIFICATION.

17:29.110 --> 17:30.805
YEAH, BUT COULDN'T
THE SLICING OF THE TONGUE

17:30.850 --> 17:32.477
JUST BE AN ESCALATION?

17:32.510 --> 17:33.716
IT'S POSSIBLE,
BUT DR. BATEMAN SAID

17:33.750 --> 17:35.615
THE CUTS WERE CLEAN.
NO HESITATION.

17:35.650 --> 17:37.186
SO THIS WASN'T
OUR UNSUB'S FIRST TIME.

17:37.220 --> 17:39.313
WHICH SUGGESTS OUR UNSUB
IS AT THE VERY LEAST

17:39.350 --> 17:41.215
FAMILIAR WITH
OR A PART OF

17:41.260 --> 17:44.127
THE BODY MODIFICATION
COMMUNITY.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.720
JJ: PEOPLE WHO ENGAGE
IN VARIOUS FORMS

17:46.760 --> 17:49.297
OF MODIFICATION OFTEN
DO SO WITH THE INTENT

17:49.330 --> 17:50.866
TO REVEAL AN ASPECT
OF THEMSELVES

17:50.900 --> 17:52.720
THAT THEY FEEL
HAS BEEN SUPPRESSED.

17:52.770 --> 17:56.297
THE MASKS THAT
HE WAS LEAVING BEHIND
WITH EACH VICTIM,

17:56.340 --> 17:58.535
HE'S EXPOSING THESE WOMEN
FOR WHO THEY REALLY ARE.

17:58.570 --> 18:00.435
PEELING AWAY THE MASKS
THEY HIDE BEHIND.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.731
FOLES: AND THE SNAKES?

18:01.780 --> 18:04.749
I MEAN, BRANDING WOMEN
AS EVIL, AS SERPENTS,

18:04.780 --> 18:06.145
IS A STORY
AS OLD AS THE BIBLE.

18:06.180 --> 18:08.648
PRENTISS: NOT JUST EVIL
BUT DECEITFUL.

18:08.680 --> 18:11.547
THE SNAKE IN THE GARDEN
OF EDEN IS A LIAR.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.182
ROSSI: OUR UNSUB'S ANGER
COULD BE DIRECTED

18:13.220 --> 18:16.257
AT WHAT HE PERCEIVES
AS HYPOCRISY OR DUPLICITY.

18:16.290 --> 18:17.848
BUT THE WOMEN HE TARGETED

18:17.890 --> 18:19.778
ARE BY ALL ACCOUNTS
MODEL CITIZENS.

18:19.830 --> 18:21.718
WELL, MAYBE THEY REPRESENT
A SPECIFIC WOMAN IN HIS LIFE

18:21.760 --> 18:23.694
THAT HE BELIEVES
HAS TWO FACES.

18:23.730 --> 18:26.164
SIMMONS: A PUBLIC
AND A PRIVATE PERSONA

18:26.200 --> 18:28.293
THAT ARE AT ODDS
WITH EACH OTHER.

18:35.410 --> 18:36.809
PRENTISS: WE NEED TO START
FROM THE INSIDE--

18:36.840 --> 18:39.843
TATTOO AND BODY
MODIFICATION ARTISTS
HERE IN AUSTIN.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.178
JJ: AND IT'S LIKELY
SERPENT IMAGERY

18:42.220 --> 18:43.642
WILL PLAY A PART
IN HIS WORK.

18:43.690 --> 18:46.341
PRENTISS: YOU SHOULD CANVASS
LOCAL SHOPS AND PARLORS,

18:46.390 --> 18:47.812
SCOUR THE WEB
AND SOCIAL MEDIA

18:47.860 --> 18:51.352
FOR ARTISTS AND ENTHUSIASTS
WHO FIT THIS PROFILE.

18:58.400 --> 19:01.938
AGENT ALVEZ. THEY SAID
YOU'RE MAKING PROGRESS.

19:01.970 --> 19:05.736
THEY BROUGHT ME BACK IN
TO LOOK AT PHOTOS
OF POTENTIAL SUSPECT S.

19:05.770 --> 19:08.807
THAT'S GREAT. YEAH.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

19:08.840 --> 19:11.741
BETTER. MY KIDS
ARE COMING HOME.

19:11.780 --> 19:12.940
THEY'VE BEEN STAYING
WITH MY MOTHER.

19:12.980 --> 19:14.743
I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM
SINCE THE ATTACK.

19:14.780 --> 19:16.919
I DIDN'T WANT
TO SCARE THEM.

19:16.950 --> 19:19.885
BUT I CAN'T
HIDE AWAY FOREVER.

19:19.920 --> 19:22.753
MY LI'ITLE ONES
ARE COUNTING ON ME.

19:27.960 --> 19:28.619
YOU OK?

19:28.660 --> 19:32.926
YEAH. I ADMIRE
HER RESILIENCE.

19:32.970 --> 19:34.835
SOME PEOPLE SURPRISE YOU.

19:34.870 --> 19:37.202
SHE'S PROBABLY
SURPRISED HERSELF.

19:37.240 --> 19:39.936
BUT WHEN YOU'VE GOT
SOMEONE COUNTING ON YOU,

19:39.970 --> 19:42.837
YOU FIND STRENGTH
YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD.

19:46.380 --> 19:47.972
FIRST OFF, I WANT TO SAY

19:48.020 --> 19:50.818
THAT ALL BABY ANIMALS
ARE CUTE, UM,

19:50.850 --> 19:52.886
BUT THE THING ABOUT
BABY SNAKES IS, UH,

19:52.920 --> 19:55.650
THEY ARE THE KIND
WHERE LIKE IF YOU THOUGHT

19:55.690 --> 19:56.657
THAT HATCHING

19:56.690 --> 19:57.850
OR SLITHERING

19:57.890 --> 19:59.858
OR SHEDDING IS CUTE,

19:59.890 --> 20:02.654
THEN THEY ARE REALLY
ADORABLE.

20:02.700 --> 20:04.691
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE
SEEM TO THINK SO

20:04.730 --> 20:07.961
BECAUSE THE ONLINE
SNAKE TRADE IS BOOMING.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.831
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW EASY IT IS

20:09.870 --> 20:12.009
TO GET A VENOMOUS SNAKE
ON THE INTERWEBS.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.405
ALTHOUGH,
FROM THE LOOKS OF IT,

20:13.440 --> 20:14.839
ONLY A FRACTION
OF THE BUYERS

20:14.880 --> 20:15.869
ACTUALLY REGISTER
WITH THE STATE.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.969
WELL, TEXAS PARK
AND WILDLIFE
SHOULD HAVE RECORDS.

20:18.010 --> 20:19.841
OF RESPONSIBLE SERPENT
OWNERS, YES,

20:19.880 --> 20:22.019
AND I'M COMING THROUGH
THOSE AS WE SPEAK.

20:22.050 --> 20:23.415
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHY YOU CALLED ME?

20:23.450 --> 20:25.008
NOW WE NEED YOU
TO TELL US ALL YOU CAN

20:25.050 --> 20:27.951
ABOUT THE BODY MODIFICATION
COMMUNITY HERE IN AUSTIN.

20:27.990 --> 20:29.252
BASICALLY ANYONE
WHO SPECIALIZES

20:29.290 --> 20:31.588
IN SNAKE IMAGERY
OR TONGUE SPLI'ITING.

20:31.630 --> 20:35.691
BODY MOD. TATTOOS.
ROGER THAT.

20:35.730 --> 20:38.995
WOW. THERE ARE A TON
OF SHOPS.

20:39.030 --> 20:42.989
BUT YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING
MORE SPECIFIC, RIGHT?

20:43.040 --> 20:45.508
SOMEONE WHO DEALS WITH
CUSTOM WORK,

20:45.540 --> 20:46.609
DIFFERENT THAN, SAY,

20:46.640 --> 20:48.676
THAT ARMY TA'ITOO
THAT SIMMONS HAS

20:48.710 --> 20:51.975
ON HIS VERY TONED
LEFT BICEP.

20:52.850 --> 20:54.408
WELL, HOW ABOUT YOU,
GARCIA?

20:54.450 --> 20:57.044
EVER GO TO THE NEEDLE?
YOU GOT ANY TATTOOS?

20:57.080 --> 20:59.446
I DON'T SEE WHY THAT'S
RELEVANT TO THIS CONVERSATION.

20:59.490 --> 21:01.515
SO YOU DO.
THAT'S INTERESTING.

21:01.560 --> 21:02.879
DIDN'T SAY THAT.
AND EVEN IF I DID,

21:02.920 --> 21:05.582
IT WOULDN'T MA'ITER,
WHETHER IT SAID "BABY GIRL"

21:05.630 --> 21:07.552
OR WHAT PART OF MY BODY
IT'S LOCATED ON OR WHATEVER.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.727
AND ANYWAY, I HAVE AN ANSWER
TO THE QUESTION

21:09.760 --> 21:11.022
THAT IS PERTINENT
TO THIS CASE.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.594
YOU GOTTA TALK
TO THIS GUY--RYAN KASH.

21:12.630 --> 21:14.063
HE HAS A CUSTOM SHOP
ON CONGRESS AVENUE.

21:14.100 --> 21:16.660
HE SPECIALIZES IN
TONGUE SPLI'ITING
AND SCARIFICATION.

21:16.700 --> 21:19.669
HERE'S HIS HOME
AND HIS WORK ADDRESS.

21:19.710 --> 21:24.500
[LOUD MUSIC PLAYING]

21:24.550 --> 21:28.475
[IN DISTINCT SONG PLAYING]

21:35.890 --> 21:37.357
CAN I HELP YOU?

21:48.500 --> 21:51.958
HEY! STOP!

21:53.040 --> 21:54.302
ALVEZ: COME HERE!

21:56.480 --> 21:57.447
STAY TH ERE!

21:57.480 --> 21:59.471
HANDS!

22:09.060 --> 22:12.086
WHY'D YOU RUN, KASH?

22:12.130 --> 22:13.722
I WAS IN TROUBLE BEFORE.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.523
THERE'S A WARRANT
OUT FOR ME.

22:15.560 --> 22:18.688
PRIOR DRUG ARRESTS
IN OKLAHOMA.

22:18.730 --> 22:19.958
QUITE THE RAP SHEET.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.538
BUT WE'RE NOT HERE
TO TALK ABOUT PE'ITY OFFENSES.

22:23.570 --> 22:25.401
3 WOMEN HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED.

22:28.010 --> 22:29.773
THAT'S YOUR SPECIALTY,
ISN'T IT?

22:29.810 --> 22:33.519
TONGUE SPLI'ITING,
SCARIFICATION.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.449
ADMIRING YOUR HANDIWORK?

22:39.490 --> 22:41.708
[LAUGHS]

22:41.760 --> 22:42.886
THAT'S NOT ME.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.057
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

22:44.090 --> 22:47.127
NEVER DO WHAT,
CUT AND TORTURE 3 WOMEN?

22:47.160 --> 22:48.798
NO, NO. NO WAY.

22:48.830 --> 22:49.990
LOOK AT THE PHOTO.

22:50.030 --> 22:50.997
SHE HAD A FRENULUM CUT.

22:51.030 --> 22:52.725
SHE COULD CHOKE
ON HER OWN TONGUE.

22:52.770 --> 22:54.897
I DON'T DO THAT.

22:54.940 --> 22:56.396
WHO WOULD?

22:56.440 --> 22:57.566
NO ONE.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.134
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

23:03.180 --> 23:06.047
WITH THE ADDITIONAL DATA
FROM THE UNSUB'S THIRD VICTIM,

23:06.080 --> 23:08.014
I WAS ABLE TO CLOSE IN
ON THE UNSUB'S COMFORT ZONE.

23:08.050 --> 23:10.518
NOW, LOOK AT THIS.
VICTIM NUMBER ONE,

23:10.550 --> 23:13.110
HANNAH ACCORD, WAS
FOUND ON COMAL STREET,

23:13.150 --> 23:14.412
JUST OUTSIDE
OF A FARMERS MARKET.

23:14.460 --> 23:16.553
VICTIM NUMBER TWO,
LIZ MEYER'S CAR,

23:16.590 --> 23:18.751
WAS FOUND
ON SIXTH STREET
IN DOWNTOWN AUSTIN,

23:18.790 --> 23:21.099
AND VICTIM NUMBER 3,
TRICIA SMOOTS, WAS FOUND

23:21.130 --> 23:23.792
IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA
IN SOUTHEAST AUSTIN.

23:23.830 --> 23:26.162
YOU GUYS SEE IT?

23:30.070 --> 23:32.209
ALVEZ: YEAH. HANCOCK
HEIGHTS PROPERTIES.

23:32.240 --> 23:33.707
REID: ALL 3 PROPERTIES
WERE HANDLED BY

23:33.740 --> 23:35.173
THE EXACT SAME
REAL ESTATE AGENT,

23:35.210 --> 23:36.939
A WOMAN NAMED LARA GUTIERREZ.

23:36.980 --> 23:37.901
THAT COULD BE
OUR CONNECTION.

23:37.950 --> 23:41.078
THE WOMAN WHOSE A'ITENTION
OUR UNSUB IS AFTER.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.145
[RING]
GO AHEAD, BOSS.

23:43.180 --> 23:44.841
I NEED EVERYTHING
YOU CAN FIND

23:44.890 --> 23:47.017
ON A WOMAN NAMED
LARA GUTIERREZ.

23:47.050 --> 23:48.586
GOT IT.

23:48.620 --> 23:51.088
KASH IS CLEAN. THE POLICE
CONFIRMED HIS ALIBI.

23:51.130 --> 23:52.188
THEY'RE JUST GONNA
HOLD HIM UNTIL

23:52.230 --> 23:53.754
HIS EXT RADITION
WARRANT COMES THROUGH.

23:53.800 --> 23:57.122
LARA GUTIERREZ, 45.
SINGLE DIVORCED MOTHER
OF TWO.

23:57.160 --> 23:58.491
EX-HUSBAND LIVES IN CLEVELAND.

23:58.530 --> 24:00.066
SHE HAS TWO DAUGHTERS,
TINA AND DESI.

24:00.100 --> 24:01.658
OK, WE NEED EVERYTHING
YOU CAN FIND

24:01.700 --> 24:04.100
ON LARA'S EX-HUSBAND,
PAST BOYFRIENDS,

24:04.140 --> 24:06.005
FORMER CLIENTS, ET CETERA.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.905
I'LL SEND YOU EVERYTHING
I'VE FOUND SO FAR.

24:07.940 --> 24:09.100
PENNY G OUT.

24:12.180 --> 24:14.011
OK, WE'VE SAID THAT
THESE A'ITACKS FEEL PERSONAL.

24:14.050 --> 24:16.712
THE VIOLENCE AND RAGE
ARE DEEP-SEATED.

24:16.750 --> 24:19.241
BUT WE HAVEN'T THEORIZED
WHAT KIND OF STRESSORS

24:19.290 --> 24:21.019
WOULD GIVE RISE
TO AN OFFENDER LIKE THIS.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.652
REID: THE PEOPLE WHO ALTER
THEIR FACES,

24:22.690 --> 24:24.829
WHETHER THROUGH SURGERY
OR ALTERNATIVE MEANS LIKE THIS,

24:24.860 --> 24:27.181
ARE OFTEN BATTLING ISSUES
OF SELF-ESTEEM AND SELF-WORTH.

24:27.230 --> 24:29.858
IN FACT, SOMETIMES THERE'S
EVEN AN UNDERLYING COMPULSION

24:29.900 --> 24:32.824
TO DESTROY A PIECE OF THEM
THAT'S TIED TO AN EARLY
EMOTIONAL TRAUMA.

24:32.870 --> 24:35.566
OK, SO IF LARA
IS INDEED THE WOMAN

24:35.600 --> 24:36.259
AT THE CENTER
OF THIS THREAD,

24:36.300 --> 24:38.632
THEN IT'S LIKELY
SHE'S THE ONE

24:38.670 --> 24:40.137
THE UNSUB VIEWS
AS WEARING A MASK.

24:40.170 --> 24:43.276
SHE'S A MOTHER,
A SUCCESSFUL
REAL ESTATE AGENT,

24:43.310 --> 24:45.870
BUT PERHAPS UNDERNEATH
ALL OF THAT,

24:45.910 --> 24:48.572
THERE'S A SIDE TO HER
THAT THE REST
OF THE WORLD DOESN'T SEE.

24:48.620 --> 24:49.814
WE HAVEN'T REALLY
TALKED MUCH ABOUT GENDER,

24:49.850 --> 24:51.283
BUT I THINK IT MAKES SENSE

24:51.320 --> 24:53.788
THAT THE PERSON WE'RE
LOOKING FOR IS A WOMAN.

24:53.820 --> 24:55.219
FEMALE OFFENDERS
ARE MORE LIKELY TO A'ITACK

24:55.260 --> 24:58.081
THE PHYSICAL APPEARANCES
OR THE LOOKS
OF THEIR VICTIMS.

24:58.130 --> 24:59.722
THE VENOM FROM
THE SNAKE BITES

24:59.760 --> 25:01.250
ESSENTIALLY
INCAPACITATED
THE VICTIMS,

25:01.300 --> 25:02.927
MAKING THEM
EASIER TO MAN EUVER,

25:02.960 --> 25:05.121
ESPECIALLY FOR
SOMEBODY OF A SMALLER
PHYSICAL STATURE.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.797
AND THERE'S BEEN NO SIGN
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT,

25:06.830 --> 25:08.832
WHICH IS STRANGE
GIVEN THE LEVEL
OF RAGE ON DISPLAY.

25:08.870 --> 25:12.601
WE MAY BE LOOKING
AT A KIND OF
INTERNALIZED MISOGYNY,

25:12.640 --> 25:16.007
A SELF-HATRED,
SOMEONE LASHING OUT,

25:16.040 --> 25:17.598
DESTROYING THE FACES
OF THEIR VICTIMS

25:17.650 --> 25:20.642
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T
STAND THEIR OWN.

25:20.680 --> 25:23.012
JJ, MA'IT, GO SEE
IF ANY OF THAT

25:23.050 --> 25:24.938
STRIKES A NOTE WITH KASH.

25:26.950 --> 25:29.316
WHY AM I STILL HERE?

25:29.360 --> 25:31.658
A SERIES OF POOR CHOICES.

25:34.130 --> 25:37.588
DO YOU KNOW EITHER
OF THOSE WOMEN?

25:45.840 --> 25:50.675
OH, KASH, YOU REALLY
GO'ITA WORK ON THAT POKER FACE.

25:50.710 --> 25:52.803
LIKE YOU'RE IN A LOT
OF TROUBLE ALREADY.

25:52.850 --> 25:55.171
I DON'T THINK YOU WANT
TO ADD ACCESSORY AFTER THE FACT

25:55.220 --> 25:58.917
AND OBSTRUCT ION OF JUSTICE
TO YOUR LIST OF OFFENSES.

25:58.950 --> 26:00.781
I GOT NO IDEA
WHO THIS CHICK IS,

26:00.820 --> 26:03.050
BUT THIS GIRL, DESI,

26:03.090 --> 26:06.685
YOU SHOULD SEE
WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE NOW.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.945
DESI, HEY,
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

26:24.980 --> 26:28.074
YOU LOOK DIFFERENT.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.213
I GOT YOUR MESSAGES.
WHAT'S UP?

26:30.250 --> 26:32.684
I NEED YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

26:32.720 --> 26:34.881
LOOK, I CAN'T GIVE YOU
ANY MORE MONEY.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.148
OK, I KNOW IN THE PAST--

26:36.190 --> 26:38.954
I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY.

26:38.990 --> 26:43.029
OK. I'M SORRY.

26:43.060 --> 26:45.699
LOOK, I HAVE SOME FINALS
I NEED TO STUDY FOR, 50--

26:45.730 --> 26:46.924
IT HAS TO BE YOU.

26:46.970 --> 26:49.359
SHE DOESN'T WANT
ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.960
SHE'LL COME IF IT'S YOU.

26:52.010 --> 26:54.729
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT? WHO?

26:55.310 --> 26:58.108
DESI, YOU'RE HURTING ME.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.608
AAH!

27:16.330 --> 27:17.661
DESI SOUGHT ME OUT.

27:17.700 --> 27:19.918
SAID SHE LIKED
THE WAY I DID THINGS.

27:19.970 --> 27:23.064
BUT, MAN, WHEN SHE CAME
TO MY SHOP 3 YEARS AGO,

27:23.100 --> 27:24.362
SHE WAS IN BAD SHAPE.

27:24.410 --> 27:25.832
HER FAMILY
KICKED HER OUT.

27:25.870 --> 27:27.167
SHE DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE TO GO.

27:27.210 --> 27:28.370
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HER?

27:28.410 --> 27:29.434
A YEAR AGO.

27:29.480 --> 27:31.801
SHE LEFT TO START
HER OWN SHOP.

27:31.850 --> 27:33.408
DUST & BONES.

27:33.450 --> 27:35.418
BUT IT NEVER
GOT OFF THE GROUND.

27:35.450 --> 27:38.681
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN
OR HEARD FROM HER SINCE.

27:38.720 --> 27:40.085
AGENTS.

27:46.490 --> 27:50.096
WE JUST GOT A REPORT
OF AN ABDUCT ION
NEAR CONGRESS AVENUE.

27:50.130 --> 27:54.339
A FEMALE VIOLENTLY COERCED
ANOTHER WOMAN INTO A CAR.

27:54.370 --> 27:56.292
AN EYEWITNESS MANAGED
TO WRITE DOWN THE PLATES.

27:56.340 --> 27:58.433
THE CAR BELONGS
TO TINA GUTIERREZ.

27:58.470 --> 28:01.109
MA'IT, YOU AND DAVE
CHECK OUT THE ABDUCT ION SITE.

28:01.140 --> 28:02.698
THERE'S MORE.

28:02.740 --> 28:06.699
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO LOCATE LARA GUTIERREZ.

28:06.750 --> 28:09.275
IF DESI GUTIERREZ
DOES HAVE HER SISTER TINA,

28:09.320 --> 28:10.742
WHERE WOULD SHE TAKE HER?

28:10.790 --> 28:12.439
AND WHAT'S HER END GAME?

28:12.490 --> 28:15.288
I'M SO GLAD
YOU LIKE IT.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.208
IT'S PRICED TO SELL,

28:17.260 --> 28:19.023
AND IT'S IN
AN UP-AND-COMING
NEIGHBORHOOD.

28:19.060 --> 28:21.449
GO AHEAD. TAKE SOME MORE
PICTURES IF YOU LIKE.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.354
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
WOMAN: WHAT DO YOU THINK?

28:23.400 --> 28:24.799
MAN: NICE. I LIKE IT.

28:24.830 --> 28:26.468
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I NEED TO TAKE THIS CALL.

28:26.500 --> 28:29.264
IT'S MY DAUGHTER.

28:29.300 --> 28:31.768
TINA, WHAT'S GOING ON?
I'M WITH CLIENTS.

28:37.540 --> 28:38.973
I AM SO SORRY.

28:39.010 --> 28:39.874
IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

28:39.910 --> 28:41.309
I NEED TO GO!

28:51.090 --> 28:53.126
ALVEZ: THE TWO SISTERS
ARE POLAR OPPOSITES.

28:53.160 --> 28:56.197
TINA IS 21, FULL-TIME
STUDENT AT UT.

28:56.230 --> 28:58.790
DESI'S 30.
DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL

28:58.830 --> 29:00.388
AND EVEN SPENT SOME TIME
IN JUVENILE DETENTION.

29:00.430 --> 29:03.490
SIBLING RIVALRY DOESN'T
USUALLY INSPIRE
THIS LEVEL OF SADISM,

29:03.540 --> 29:05.132
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT
THAT THE GIRLS

29:05.170 --> 29:07.309
ARE APPROXIMATELY
10 YEARS APART IN AGE.

29:07.340 --> 29:10.969
AUSTIN CHILD PROTECTIVE
SERVICES HAS A FILE
ON DESI GUTIERREZ.

29:11.010 --> 29:14.013
HER MOTHER LARA,
WHO WAS 15 WHEN SHE
GAVE BIRTH TO DESI,

29:14.050 --> 29:15.938
WAS ORDERED TO TAKE
PARENTING CLASSES

29:15.980 --> 29:18.414
AFTER DESI MADE SOME
PRETTY TROUBLING ACCUSATIONS

29:18.450 --> 29:19.485
AGAINST HER MOTHER.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.784
NEGLECT AND EMOTIONAL ABUSE.

29:21.820 --> 29:23.879
IT WAS JUST DESI
AND HER MOTHER
FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS.

29:23.930 --> 29:26.956
AFTER THAT, LARA GAVE BIRTH
TO HER SECOND DAUGHTER

29:26.990 --> 29:28.821
AND SEEMED TO TURN
HER LIFE AROUND.

29:28.860 --> 29:32.193
BUT BY THEN, THE DAMAGE
WAS ALREADY DONE.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.463
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

29:38.510 --> 29:42.970
DID MOM EVER SEND YOU
OUT BACK FOR PUNISHMENT?

29:43.010 --> 29:46.207
PROBABLY NOT.

29:46.250 --> 29:49.970
YOU WERE ALWAYS
THE PERFECT ONE.

29:50.020 --> 29:53.444
BUT ME, I GOT BANISHED
TO THE SHED

29:53.490 --> 29:56.288
ALMOST EVERY DAY.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.925
IT WAS CRAMPED AND HOT.

29:58.960 --> 30:01.599
FULL OF SPIDERS.

30:01.630 --> 30:05.964
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
WAS IN THAT SHED?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.059
SNAKES.

30:09.940 --> 30:12.534
ALL KINDS.

30:12.570 --> 30:15.869
AND THEY'D SLITHER, HISS,

30:15.910 --> 30:20.802
AND CLIMB ALL AROUND ME.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.844
HOURS WOULD PASS,

30:24.890 --> 30:27.916
AND THEY NEVER BIT ME.
