with this case, great.

10:48.786 --> 10:51.021
But if not,
you're a therapist.

10:51.055 --> 10:53.557
Compartmentalize.

10:56.328 --> 10:57.862
I know
you're concerned, honey.

10:57.896 --> 11:00.130
But I wouldn't have come to work
if I wasn't feeling better.

11:00.164 --> 11:01.431
All right?
You know that about me.

11:01.465 --> 11:02.799
I don't need the--

11:02.834 --> 11:04.434
- Bill, I found it.
- I don't need the pills, babe.

11:04.468 --> 11:07.137
I'm at work. I'm busy, okay?
- Bill, what--

11:07.171 --> 11:08.505
you're drinking pills.

11:08.539 --> 11:10.707
Bill, come on, I found it.
You asked me to do this.

11:10.742 --> 11:13.109
Babe, I got to go. I'll go--
yes, I'll take it easy.

11:13.143 --> 11:14.177
Yeah, you found who?

11:14.211 --> 11:17.513
Stanton Parish--
he was a who.

11:17.547 --> 11:19.815
And you were right--
he was on the cloud drive.

11:19.849 --> 11:22.817
So he's a scientist
who died in 1974.

11:22.852 --> 11:25.720
Yeah, and he worked for
the government, for M.K. Ultra.

11:25.755 --> 11:27.690
And before he died,
he wrote this, Bill.

11:27.724 --> 11:29.792
It's a manifesto
about Alphas.

11:29.826 --> 11:31.561
And back then, they weren't
even called Alphas.

11:31.595 --> 11:34.063
All right, so, "Neuro-dominant
humanity represents

11:34.098 --> 11:36.500
"the greatest potential
advancement for civilization

11:36.534 --> 11:38.369
"since man first
walked upright,

11:38.403 --> 11:40.137
"which is why those
who fear change

11:40.171 --> 11:41.940
"will inevitably seek
to eliminate us."

11:41.974 --> 11:43.841
The--
he was an Alpha?

11:43.876 --> 11:45.409
Yeah, and he was
a good writer.

11:45.443 --> 11:46.777
Anna writes stuff like this.

11:46.812 --> 11:49.146
Stanton Parish is
Red Flag's favorite dead author?

11:49.181 --> 11:50.447
No, invisible girl

11:50.482 --> 11:52.082
made it sound like this guy was
the key to everything.

11:52.116 --> 11:53.483
So there's
got to be more, Gary.

11:53.517 --> 11:55.718
- Bill, look how much I printed.
- No, I know, this is a lot.

11:55.753 --> 11:57.217
But there's got to be more.
Please keep digging.

11:57.242 --> 11:59.480
Yeah, I-I I don't think
I like hard work.

12:00.056 --> 12:02.690
Dani, I need you to tell me
the truth about what happened.

12:02.725 --> 12:04.325
We don't have time
for games.

12:04.359 --> 12:07.128
Of course we don't have
time for games.

12:07.162 --> 12:09.163
We never had time for games.

12:09.197 --> 12:11.399
There's blood tests,
psych tests,

12:11.433 --> 12:13.801
E.E.G.s, sure,
but games?

12:13.835 --> 12:15.903
Why don't you just stick some
electrodes to my forehead, Dad?

12:15.937 --> 12:17.905
Just for old times' sake,
tell me how I'm feeling.

12:17.939 --> 12:20.875
- That was 15 years ago--
- So I should be over it?

12:20.909 --> 12:22.410
I mean, is that
what you're saying?

12:22.444 --> 12:24.545
You're in serious trouble,
Danielle.

12:24.579 --> 12:26.814
You need to calm down,
tell me what happened,

12:26.848 --> 12:28.449
so I can help you.

12:28.483 --> 12:30.217
So you want to help.

12:35.425 --> 12:39.429
You know what Will would do
when I was upset?

12:39.463 --> 12:41.764
Bring me flowers...

12:41.799 --> 12:45.034
Get me whatever drug I needed,

12:45.069 --> 12:47.102
even if he had to steal it.

12:49.339 --> 12:52.041
Then again,
he loved me, so...

12:52.075 --> 12:54.077
Well, I love you, too.

13:04.088 --> 13:07.524
You want to know
what Red Flag was after?

13:07.558 --> 13:10.694
These.

13:10.728 --> 13:15.231
I took 'em from some guy
at a meeting.

13:15.266 --> 13:17.067
I thought
they were rubies.

13:17.101 --> 13:20.270
But, uh, it turns out
they're just glass.

13:40.090 --> 13:41.657
Hands up.

13:41.691 --> 13:43.359
Ow.

13:43.393 --> 13:46.262
I don't like--

13:46.296 --> 13:49.197
[stammers]

13:53.802 --> 13:56.037
Ow.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.411
Anna.

14:03.445 --> 14:07.013
It's good to see you.

14:07.048 --> 14:09.015
You always say
that we can't meet up.

14:09.050 --> 14:13.086
But I-I wanted
to see you again.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.854
[Computerized voice]
It's good to see you.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.722
It has all your sounds
on there.

14:16.757 --> 14:17.856
That's very cool, Anna.

14:17.891 --> 14:20.192
I've missed
our conversations.

14:20.226 --> 14:22.161
Yeah, I've missed them, too.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.264
And doctor--

14:25.298 --> 14:26.332
oh.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.202
Okay.

14:34.008 --> 14:37.278
I wish you were here
for another reason.

14:37.312 --> 14:39.113
That quote
you sent me, Gary...

14:39.148 --> 14:40.582
Oh, yeah.

14:40.616 --> 14:44.518
"Society's acceptance is
a prison disguised as a palace."

14:44.553 --> 14:46.521
Where did you find that?

14:46.555 --> 14:47.688
It's Stanton Parish.

14:47.723 --> 14:51.292
Is he your favorite
writer, Anna?

14:51.326 --> 14:55.028
Gary, Stanton Parish
is a very dangerous man.

14:55.062 --> 14:58.331
You shouldn't be asking
questions about him.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.669
Anna you said "is."

15:02.703 --> 15:05.005
Stanton Parish is dead.

15:05.039 --> 15:06.506
He died 30 years ago.

15:06.541 --> 15:10.044
He--he's Red Flag's
favorite dead author.

15:10.078 --> 15:14.348
You need to go now, Gary.

15:14.383 --> 15:18.019
Anna, why--
why do I have to go now?

15:18.053 --> 15:19.220
I just got here.

15:19.255 --> 15:21.356
Why do I--Anna, Anna,
don't make me go.

15:21.391 --> 15:23.325
It was difficult for me
to come and see you.

15:23.359 --> 15:24.726
Anna, I had to be sneaky.

15:24.761 --> 15:26.028
Ow.

15:26.062 --> 15:27.229
Anna.

15:29.287 --> 15:31.509
Dani you did the right thing
giving us the necklace.

15:31.534 --> 15:32.734
Thank you.

15:32.759 --> 15:33.959
We should talk.

15:34.226 --> 15:37.128
Will you sit down, please.

15:37.162 --> 15:38.246
[Clears throat]

15:38.247 --> 15:40.177
- The past is past, okay?- Okay.

15:40.178 --> 15:42.080
And I-I think you'll find that
I'm a pretty different person

15:42.114 --> 15:44.682
than I was 15 years ago.
Are you?

15:44.716 --> 15:48.485
To me, you seem to be pretty
much exactly the same...

15:48.519 --> 15:51.354
Except now you have a whole team
of people to play with.

15:51.389 --> 15:53.156
Don't talk
about what you don't know.

15:53.191 --> 15:54.591
You have no idea
what's going on.

15:54.626 --> 15:56.527
Dad, there are
different kinds of lying.

15:56.561 --> 15:59.831
You can tell people
what they want to hear.

15:59.865 --> 16:02.567
You can, uh, pretend
that you care.

16:02.602 --> 16:05.370
And then there's
outright manipulation.

16:05.405 --> 16:07.707
And when have I ever
manipulated you?

16:07.741 --> 16:09.909
"Camel mealie."

16:09.943 --> 16:13.180
Chamomile tea?

16:13.214 --> 16:16.850
Whenever mom
would get angry at you

16:16.884 --> 16:20.320
for locking yourself in a room
with your lab work,

16:20.355 --> 16:21.755
you would come to me

16:21.790 --> 16:24.891
and say,
"Dani, mommy's sad."

16:24.926 --> 16:28.195
"Please bring her
a cup of 'camel mealie' tea."

16:28.229 --> 16:29.863
Right, no, I remember.

16:29.897 --> 16:32.598
But, Dani, that's not--

16:32.633 --> 16:35.568
So I would bring her the tea,
and I would sit on her lap,

16:35.602 --> 16:39.204
and I would stroke her arm,
and she'd feel better.

16:39.239 --> 16:42.408
Empathic contagion, right?
Isn't that what you call it?

16:42.442 --> 16:44.877
All right, that's right.

16:44.911 --> 16:46.579
Well, that was me.

16:46.613 --> 16:48.247
I was mommy's little helper.

16:48.281 --> 16:52.517
But, uh, you know, that's not
exactly the way it happened.

16:52.552 --> 16:54.653
And that was before I knew
about your ability.

16:54.687 --> 16:57.189
You're right, Dad.
you're always right...

16:57.224 --> 16:59.459
Except with the tea,

16:59.493 --> 17:03.196
I did that
until mom and I moved out...

17:03.231 --> 17:05.766
when I was 12.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.236
You knew what I could do
when I was nine.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.646
Hey, Doc.
Doc, come here.

17:20.682 --> 17:22.249
Listen...

17:22.282 --> 17:23.516
You okay?

17:23.550 --> 17:25.785
Yeah, it was a mistake
to bring my daughter here.

17:25.819 --> 17:27.487
We have 12 hours to figure out
what Red Flag is up to.

17:27.521 --> 17:28.688
No, no, listen to me, Doc--

17:28.722 --> 17:30.123
That's what we should be
working on.

17:30.157 --> 17:31.424
Doc, listen to me.
Listen to me.

17:31.459 --> 17:32.659
We haven't
cracked it yet,

17:32.693 --> 17:34.394
but Gary and I just found
something that is huge.

17:34.428 --> 17:35.996
You need
to see it now.

17:36.030 --> 17:37.731
All right.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.066
So we looked for the name,
but all we found was

17:40.101 --> 17:41.501
a book by a dead guy.

17:41.535 --> 17:44.004
And then when I asked Anna about
it, she just lied to me again.

17:44.038 --> 17:45.071
Gary, you spoke with Anna?

17:45.105 --> 17:46.739
I expressly told you
not to do that.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.274
Doc, I told him
the same thing, okay?

17:48.308 --> 17:50.610
But he's his own man now.
Now, just give him a minute.

17:50.644 --> 17:51.811
Yeah, yeah,
give me a minute.

17:51.845 --> 17:53.413
I'm my own man.
Thanks, Bill.

17:53.447 --> 17:56.182
So Anna's a good liar,
not like me.

17:56.217 --> 17:57.651
But--but I still caught her,

17:57.685 --> 18:00.353
because she said "is"
instead of "was."

18:00.388 --> 18:02.489
Stanton Parish
isn't a dead writer.

18:02.523 --> 18:04.090
- He's alive.
- Bill, please...

18:04.124 --> 18:06.892
So I did another search,
but not by name,

18:06.927 --> 18:08.227
by face, and that's--

18:08.261 --> 18:10.563
that's the creepy part
Bill was talking about.

18:10.597 --> 18:13.065
There, he was a scientist
in Russia

18:13.100 --> 18:14.433
for their M.K. Ultra program--

18:14.467 --> 18:16.068
same face, same man.

18:16.102 --> 18:18.436
So Stanton Parrish
was a double agent.

18:18.471 --> 18:20.772
No, no, no, Dr. Rosen,
it's a puzzle.

18:20.806 --> 18:22.573
You have to look
at all the pieces.

18:22.608 --> 18:24.042
It's a metaphor.

18:24.076 --> 18:27.478
Okay. Okay.
Just--

18:27.513 --> 18:29.848
Same face.

18:29.882 --> 18:32.517
Stanton Parish.

18:32.551 --> 18:36.687
Stanton Parish.

18:36.721 --> 18:39.223
Stanton Parish.

18:40.993 --> 18:43.594
Wait. This is
from the Civil War.

18:43.629 --> 18:44.929
Yeah, it's old.

18:44.963 --> 18:46.798
He was about
40 years old, right?

18:46.832 --> 18:49.701
Same guy 100 years later
when he worked for M.K. Ultra.

18:53.172 --> 18:55.573
Is this an Alpha
who doesn't age?

18:55.607 --> 18:57.007
Anna says
that he's dangerous.

18:57.042 --> 18:59.910
She's scared of him,
and Anna's not scared of anyone.

18:59.944 --> 19:01.679
And there's this.

19:01.713 --> 19:03.213
He wrote this--
the manifesto.

19:03.247 --> 19:05.549
Bill says it's
the Red Flag playbook.

19:05.583 --> 19:09.185
An Alpha this powerful
and we knew nothing about him?

19:09.219 --> 19:11.554
Well, that's why they were
trying to erase our files--

19:11.588 --> 19:14.357
to keep Parish hidden.

19:19.663 --> 19:22.366
Meet the new boss...

19:22.400 --> 19:26.638
Same as the old boss.

19:26.672 --> 19:27.906
I got it.

19:27.940 --> 19:31.210
The rubies--
I figured it out.

19:32.913 --> 19:35.047
These may seem like junk,

19:35.082 --> 19:37.449
but this
is laboratory-grown silicon,

19:37.484 --> 19:40.352
more densely organized than
anything I have ever seen.

19:40.387 --> 19:42.722
It is the perfect
storage medium.

19:42.756 --> 19:46.826
So I decided to...

19:46.861 --> 19:48.929
Play around.

19:52.200 --> 19:55.135
And then in this...

19:55.170 --> 19:57.938
Inside the pendant,

19:57.973 --> 20:00.474
I discovered this.

20:02.811 --> 20:05.846
- It's a jump drive.
- Voila.

20:05.881 --> 20:07.581
- Gary, can you...?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:07.616 --> 20:08.850
I'll do this.

20:12.019 --> 20:13.219
There.

20:13.254 --> 20:14.421
Wait a minute.

20:14.455 --> 20:16.156
That's--that's
encoded data, right?

20:16.190 --> 20:17.590
So, Gary, isn't that
Anna's language?

20:17.625 --> 20:20.926
Yeah, that's what Anna does.
She sends messages.

20:20.961 --> 20:22.494
Like the D.O.T. numbers
on the truck they blew up,

20:22.529 --> 20:23.795
the order to assassinate
Dr. Rosen...

20:23.830 --> 20:25.163
No, no, she regrets that.

20:25.197 --> 20:26.498
She said that
that's regrettable.

20:26.532 --> 20:27.932
We'll argue
about that later, okay?

20:27.967 --> 20:29.434
Can you translate this?

20:29.468 --> 20:31.502
Yeah.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.976
Those are GPS coordinates.

20:38.011 --> 20:39.979
Yeah, it leads
to Highland Mills.

20:40.013 --> 20:41.981
That's not far from here--
60 miles.

20:42.015 --> 20:43.449
It's a map.

20:43.483 --> 20:45.284
Directions.

20:45.318 --> 20:47.653
No, no, it's an invitation.
You see right here?

20:47.687 --> 20:49.956
There's a time, 7:00 a.m.,

20:49.990 --> 20:52.425
like Sullivan said,
tomorrow morning.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.927
All right, so that's
a time and date for a meeting.

20:54.962 --> 20:57.129
- What's that underneath?
- That part's sneaky.

20:57.164 --> 20:59.298
It's even sneakier
than Anna's code.

21:02.168 --> 21:03.969
So, what'd I steal?

21:04.003 --> 21:06.438
Oh, okay, no, no, no.
I've got it.

21:06.472 --> 21:07.772
It's a quote--

21:07.807 --> 21:09.707
here, at the bottom.

21:09.742 --> 21:12.043
"We are not the problem.
We are the solution."

21:12.077 --> 21:13.478
It's from that book,
<i>A Call to Change.</i>

21:13.512 --> 21:15.180
It's more
than a quote, Gary.

21:15.214 --> 21:17.082
It's a signature...

21:17.116 --> 21:20.252
from the leader of Red Flag,
Stanton Parish.

21:20.286 --> 21:22.388
He's called this meeting.

21:22.423 --> 21:24.490
We confirmed the intel
you gave us.

21:24.524 --> 21:25.691
Nice work on that.

21:25.726 --> 21:28.962
The target--an old abandoned
brick factory.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.997
We're bringing in tactical
teams, special equipment,

21:31.032 --> 21:32.699
everything
we can throw at them.

21:32.734 --> 21:35.068
You're positive
this supposed leader of theirs

21:35.102 --> 21:36.536
is going to be there?

21:36.570 --> 21:37.904
Well, he called the meeting.
I suppose he'll be there.

21:37.939 --> 21:39.506
And Anna's
gonna be there, too.

21:39.540 --> 21:41.942
And you can't hurt her.
She--she's my friend.

21:41.976 --> 21:43.843
And she can't protect herself.

21:43.878 --> 21:46.413
Our first move will be
tear gas and nonlethal weapons.

21:46.447 --> 21:47.548
But let me be clear.

21:47.582 --> 21:49.316
These terrorists
will be neutralized.

21:49.351 --> 21:50.985
Yes, Senator?

21:51.019 --> 21:52.486
Gary,
maybe you should go home.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.121
No, I'm not going home.

21:54.155 --> 21:55.589
Anna's gonna be there,
and I'm gonna be there.

21:55.623 --> 21:57.057
I'm part of the team.

21:57.091 --> 21:59.092
Okay, well, I'll join in
with tactical, do what I can.

21:59.126 --> 22:01.161
And, uh, I'll protect Anna
if it's possible.

22:01.195 --> 22:03.830
Doc, you'll stay outside and
coordinate with Rachel and Gary.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.398
I'm gonna go in
with Hicks and Nina.

22:05.432 --> 22:07.833
Bill, you can go in,
but only as an agent.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.335
It's too early to put that kind
of stress on your heart.

22:09.369 --> 22:10.970
This is Red Flag versus us.

22:11.004 --> 22:12.972
This is endgame.

22:13.007 --> 22:14.941
I'm in.

22:31.808 --> 22:33.943
Here you go, Doc.

22:33.978 --> 22:36.814
It's time.

22:36.848 --> 22:40.651
Hey.

22:40.686 --> 22:42.553
Hey.

22:42.588 --> 22:44.222
These guys
you're going after--

22:44.257 --> 22:45.657
is it their fault
that Will's dead?

22:45.692 --> 22:47.959
Yes, I believe it is.

22:47.993 --> 22:50.996
Then I hope you get
all of 'em.

22:53.032 --> 22:57.035
Rosy future...

22:57.069 --> 23:00.773
Something someone once said
that I wanted.

23:00.807 --> 23:04.177
And he wasn't wrong.

23:04.211 --> 23:07.647
What would that
even look like?

23:07.681 --> 23:11.851
Dani...

23:11.885 --> 23:13.253
You were right.

23:13.287 --> 23:14.854
About the tea.

23:14.889 --> 23:17.458
I knew about your ability.

23:17.492 --> 23:19.360
And so I used it.

23:19.394 --> 23:22.363
I used you
to try to save a marriage

23:22.397 --> 23:24.832
that I'd already ruined.

23:28.102 --> 23:30.737
I-I-I don't know what
you expect me to say, Dad.

23:30.771 --> 23:33.139
I don't expect you
to say anything.

23:33.173 --> 23:35.541
You don't have to.

23:35.575 --> 23:39.344
I just wanted you
to hear it.

23:43.416 --> 23:45.450
No, I'm not coming home
tonight, Mom.

23:45.485 --> 23:48.020
I...I can't tell you.

23:48.054 --> 23:50.022
But my friends
need my help...

23:50.057 --> 23:51.591
All of my friends.

23:51.625 --> 23:53.126
Yeah, I love you, too, Mom.

23:53.160 --> 23:54.895
Mom, please, don't cry.

23:54.929 --> 23:57.064
Listen,
Bill's gonna protect me.

23:57.098 --> 23:59.667
He's my partner,
he--he's very strong.

23:59.702 --> 24:01.469
One time
he pushed me over,

24:01.504 --> 24:04.105
which was better
than taking a bullet.

24:04.140 --> 24:05.573
I said don't cry.

24:05.607 --> 24:08.075
Come on, time to saddle up.
Let's go.

24:30.129 --> 24:32.030
Anna's here--
two bodyguards.

24:32.065 --> 24:34.433
That makes over
30 Red Flag Alphas inside.

24:34.467 --> 24:36.134
Gary says that's the last car
heading this way,

24:36.169 --> 24:37.402
as far as he can tell.

24:37.436 --> 24:41.306
We have to hurry.

24:47.247 --> 24:48.948
Dr. Ro--

24:48.982 --> 24:50.283
Dr. Rosen.

24:50.317 --> 24:52.152
Dr. Rosen, you should let me go
and talk to--

24:52.186 --> 24:53.654
you should let me go
and talk to Anna,

24:53.688 --> 24:55.122
'cause I could get them
to surrender.

24:55.156 --> 24:56.957
I always get people to do
what I want to do,

24:56.992 --> 24:58.225
'cause I-I wear them down.

24:58.260 --> 24:59.560
Yeah, you do that, Gary.

24:59.595 --> 25:01.295
Gary, this is
a very dangerous situation.

25:01.330 --> 25:04.031
If you want to be here, you have
to do exactly as you're told.

25:04.065 --> 25:05.266
Yep.

25:08.970 --> 25:10.704
You look like
you belong here.

25:10.739 --> 25:12.339
Once a marine...

25:12.373 --> 25:14.074
I thought you hated
the Marines.

25:14.108 --> 25:15.809
It's kind of a love-hate.

25:19.647 --> 25:22.015
Look, if anything
happens to me...

25:22.049 --> 25:24.117
Don't say it.

25:24.151 --> 25:27.521
It's bad luck.

25:27.555 --> 25:29.323
Still no sign of Parish?

25:29.357 --> 25:30.657
Nothing--
he never showed

25:30.692 --> 25:33.261
and neither have about
another dozen Red Flag leaders.

25:33.295 --> 25:35.797
From what I can hear inside,
they are not happy about it.

25:35.831 --> 25:37.399
I don't get it.
He calls the meeting.

25:37.434 --> 25:38.634
He doesn't show?

25:38.668 --> 25:39.969
It doesn't make sense.

25:40.003 --> 25:42.071
He should--
- it's starting.

25:42.105 --> 25:43.940
What are they saying?

25:43.974 --> 25:46.242
Hiding like this
is only making things worse.

25:46.277 --> 25:48.044
You don't get
to decide that.

25:48.078 --> 25:49.379
Let her talk!

25:49.413 --> 25:52.315
They're talking
about going public.

25:52.349 --> 25:53.817
Going public?

25:53.851 --> 25:58.421
Telling the world
the truth about Alphas.

25:58.456 --> 25:59.990
Remember,
stick with your teams,

26:00.024 --> 26:02.926
watch your fields of fire,
and give the gas time to work.

26:02.961 --> 26:04.895
No one advances
until I say so.

26:04.930 --> 26:06.497
Agent Sullivan, Kathy.

26:06.531 --> 26:08.766
Wait, wait,
we--we can't do this.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.634
Put some socks on, Lee,
your feet are getting cold.

26:10.669 --> 26:13.972
No, will you bear with me
just--just for a moment?

26:14.006 --> 26:16.374
The day before this meeting
was supposed to happen,

26:16.408 --> 26:18.843
a Red Flag assassin leads us
right to my daughter,

26:18.877 --> 26:20.545
who is carrying
an invitation,

26:20.579 --> 26:23.181
which my team decodes
just in time for us to be here.

26:23.215 --> 26:25.951
Now, what does that
sound like to you?

26:25.985 --> 26:27.118
A setup.

26:27.153 --> 26:29.221
So you think we're walking
into an ambush.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.089
No, I think
we are the ambush.

26:31.124 --> 26:32.691
Stanton Parish
gathered these people here.

26:32.725 --> 26:34.326
He tips us off
to their location

26:34.360 --> 26:36.028
just so that we'll do
exactly what we're doing.

26:36.062 --> 26:38.096
Why would Stanton Parish
betray Red Flag?

26:38.130 --> 26:40.031
According to you,
it's his organization.

26:40.065 --> 26:41.800
Because Rachel just heard
the people inside talking.

26:41.834 --> 26:44.002
They're talking
about coming out of the dark,

26:44.036 --> 26:45.303
revealing their secrets.

26:45.337 --> 26:46.771
- Going public?
- Yes.

26:46.805 --> 26:48.072
Well, then it's a good thing
we're here, Lee.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.208
No, Kathy, and I am betting
that's exactly

26:50.242 --> 26:52.010
what Stanton Parish
wants you to feel.

26:52.044 --> 26:53.478
You're playing right
into his hands.

26:53.512 --> 26:55.046
You are betting,
you think.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.048
A week ago, you didn't even know
that Stanton Parish existed.

26:57.082 --> 26:58.649
And now apparently
you're in his head.

26:58.684 --> 27:00.317
I don't have time
for your theories, Lee.

27:00.352 --> 27:01.685
Do the people
in that building

27:01.720 --> 27:03.020
belong to
a terrorist organization?

27:03.055 --> 27:04.455
It's not that simple.

27:04.489 --> 27:06.023
Really? Because I think
it's a yes or no question.

27:06.057 --> 27:07.891
Are they Red Flag or not?

27:07.926 --> 27:10.260
All right, I'm not saying
that they're all innocent--

27:10.295 --> 27:13.263
Well, good. Then you haven't
lost your mind altogether.

27:13.297 --> 27:16.699
Go! Get into
your positions now!

27:29.746 --> 27:32.749
Oh, Rachel,
this is a mistake.

27:32.783 --> 27:35.719
This is a big mistake.

27:43.028 --> 27:47.365
Team one in position.

27:47.399 --> 27:50.568
Team two on the move.

27:50.602 --> 27:52.736
You're wearing a mask.
You can't push anyone.

27:52.771 --> 27:56.206
- You should hang back.
- I'll be okay.

28:03.247 --> 28:04.780
Team two in position.

28:04.815 --> 28:07.884
Ready on your go, command.

28:07.918 --> 28:10.821
Release the gas.

28:16.581 --> 28:19.652
Federal agents. Surrender
and no one will get hurt.

28:25.906 --> 28:27.473
[All coughing]

28:27.790 --> 28:29.001
Get out!
Run!

28:29.002 --> 28:32.271
Command, team leader--
rounding up suspects.

28:36.941 --> 28:38.275
No, no.

28:38.309 --> 28:40.477
No! No!

28:40.511 --> 28:41.478
- Dr. Rosen--
- Gary! Gary!

28:41.512 --> 28:42.545
Gary, no!

28:42.580 --> 28:44.213
Rachel, stay here.
Stay here.

28:44.247 --> 28:46.782
Gary!

28:48.619 --> 28:50.987
[Explosion]

28:54.458 --> 28:56.626

29:28.226 --> 29:31.428
[Groaning]

29:51.316 --> 29:53.317
Anna!

29:53.351 --> 29:56.421
Anna, I'm coming!

30:10.569 --> 30:12.903
You're like me.

30:12.937 --> 30:15.105
Better.

30:17.041 --> 30:20.476
Gary!

30:20.510 --> 30:23.679
Gary!

30:23.713 --> 30:28.117
Whoa! Whoa!

30:28.151 --> 30:32.054
Ah! No, no!

30:32.088 --> 30:35.290
[Choking]

30:35.325 --> 30:36.559
Gary.

30:36.593 --> 30:38.094
[Coughs]
Gary!

30:38.128 --> 30:43.066
[Choking]

30:43.100 --> 30:45.001
Sleep.

30:47.838 --> 30:49.973
Gary!
Wait, Gary.

31:05.591 --> 31:07.725
Man down! Man down!

31:07.760 --> 31:09.461
Permission to open fire?

31:09.495 --> 31:11.930
Copy that.
Return fire is authorized.

31:11.965 --> 31:14.066
Return fire
is authorized.

31:14.100 --> 31:16.736
Fire at will.

31:16.771 --> 31:18.938
[Indistinct shouting]

31:18.973 --> 31:20.340
Anna! Anna!

31:33.354 --> 31:34.621
Anna?

31:34.655 --> 31:37.190
[Coughing]
Anna!

31:37.225 --> 31:40.494
Ah! Ah!

31:47.503 --> 31:49.938
[Grunts]

31:57.547 --> 32:00.883
Anna!
[Gasps]

32:00.917 --> 32:02.951
Anna!

32:02.986 --> 32:04.920
Anna.
Anna, it's okay.

32:04.954 --> 32:05.921
Anna, come on.

32:05.955 --> 32:09.057
I'll help carry you.
Anna...

32:09.092 --> 32:11.193
Anna, come on, I'll--

32:16.532 --> 32:18.600
Anna. Anna.

32:18.635 --> 32:21.303
Anna, come on.

32:26.076 --> 32:27.676
Anna, get--

32:27.711 --> 32:28.978
don't--no!

32:29.012 --> 32:31.180
No!

32:33.617 --> 32:36.086
No! No! No!

32:38.089 --> 32:40.257
No! No! No!

32:47.532 --> 32:49.499
No! No!

32:49.534 --> 32:51.534
He's one of us.

32:55.806 --> 32:59.008
[Coughing]

32:59.042 --> 33:01.643
Gary, Gary.

33:01.677 --> 33:03.311
Oh, my God.

33:04.847 --> 33:07.750
Oh, my God.

33:09.019 --> 33:11.755
Anna!

33:15.793 --> 33:17.360
People died.

33:17.394 --> 33:19.362
Anna died.

33:19.397 --> 33:21.430
And she shouldn't be dead.

33:21.465 --> 33:24.134
And it--if I--
if I had a gas mask,

33:24.168 --> 33:26.436
I probably
could have saved her.

33:26.470 --> 33:27.804
Gary, you don't know that.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.540
Yeah, well, you don't know
either--nobody knows.

33:30.574 --> 33:32.242
And Dr. Rosen--
he doesn't know.

33:32.276 --> 33:34.978
See, he pretends to know
everything,

33:35.012 --> 33:38.648
but he doesn't.

33:42.152 --> 33:45.755
I don't know
if I can keep doing this.

33:45.789 --> 33:48.758
I don't think I'm the only one
who feels that way.

33:48.793 --> 33:51.928
No, she's not.

33:51.963 --> 33:53.697
We don't know
what we're doing.

33:53.731 --> 33:57.067
And I'm not sure
if we ever did.

33:57.101 --> 34:01.072
And right now
there is no "this."

34:01.106 --> 34:03.308
No, Cameron, you're wrong.

34:03.342 --> 34:07.011
This is a team.

34:07.045 --> 34:10.347
And that hasn't changed.

34:10.382 --> 34:13.951
What you've done you've done
for the right reasons,

34:13.985 --> 34:16.721
under circumstances
that sometimes

34:16.755 --> 34:19.290
were beyond
even our control.

34:19.324 --> 34:22.092
You followed your instincts.

34:22.127 --> 34:23.960
You followed your hearts.

34:23.995 --> 34:27.931
You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

34:27.966 --> 34:29.433
We have to stand on that.

34:29.467 --> 34:31.101
Yeah, but...

34:31.136 --> 34:32.570
What about the fact
that every time we--

34:32.603 --> 34:33.938
Lee.

34:33.972 --> 34:35.706
Sorry, excuse me.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.440
Could I talk to you
for a minute?

34:37.476 --> 34:39.643
Yeah.

34:45.049 --> 34:48.385
Is this where you explain all
about clouds and silver linings?

34:48.418 --> 34:51.454
Not me.

34:51.487 --> 34:52.822
Hey...

34:52.856 --> 34:54.757
This is still a win, Lee.

34:54.791 --> 34:58.727
A win for who--
us or Stanton Parish?

34:58.761 --> 35:01.162
If Parish exists,
we'll get him.

35:01.196 --> 35:02.663
So you have whatever resources
you need.

35:02.697 --> 35:04.731
Money, equipment--
it's yours.

35:04.766 --> 35:06.099
You want another Alpha
on your team?

35:06.134 --> 35:07.634
Pick one.
Pick five.

35:07.668 --> 35:09.135
How would your daughter
like a job?

35:09.170 --> 35:11.304
Can we please not talk
about my daughter?

35:11.338 --> 35:14.107
Fair enough.

35:14.142 --> 35:16.843
Look, I know you're not able
to see it right now,

35:16.877 --> 35:20.179
but the raid on Highland Mills
was a success.

35:20.213 --> 35:22.748
It crippled Red Flag.
We caught terrorists.

35:22.782 --> 35:26.251
We stopped this Alpha situation
from being blown wide open.

35:26.286 --> 35:30.289
And that is a huge victory
for you and your team.

35:31.825 --> 35:33.259
Thank you.

35:33.293 --> 35:34.393
And if you need proof,

35:34.428 --> 35:35.628
the powers that be
would like your input

35:35.663 --> 35:37.931
on how to move forward.

35:37.965 --> 35:40.967
Closed-door session in D.C.
a week from today.

35:41.001 --> 35:44.003
We look forward
to your thoughts.

35:49.943 --> 35:51.944
They're calling it
a success, this raid,

35:51.979 --> 35:53.278
but I'm not so sure,

35:53.313 --> 35:55.981
which is par for the course
these days.

35:56.016 --> 35:57.883
You know,
when I was little,

35:57.917 --> 36:00.119
I, uh--well, I thought you knew
more about everything

36:00.153 --> 36:01.753
than anyone else in the world.

36:01.788 --> 36:05.357
And, um, I guess now
I see that

36:05.392 --> 36:07.894
you don't know all the answers
to the questions,

36:07.928 --> 36:11.564
and sometimes you don't
even know the questions.

36:11.598 --> 36:13.633
Well, I guess that's part
of growing up--

36:13.667 --> 36:16.569
realizing that your parents
have feet of clay.

36:16.604 --> 36:17.971
Yeah, well,
to tell you the truth,

36:18.005 --> 36:20.306
I like you better
this way.

36:24.212 --> 36:25.278
[Sighs]

36:25.313 --> 36:28.382
Dani, what you've been
through--

36:28.416 --> 36:30.684
what I've put you through--

36:30.719 --> 36:33.954
it must have been
incredibly painful.

36:37.292 --> 36:39.893
You can't even imagine, Dad.

36:39.928 --> 36:41.762
No, I can't.

36:41.796 --> 36:45.132
You know, I tend
to intellectualize everything,

36:45.167 --> 36:48.269
approach everything
from an analytical standpoint,

36:48.303 --> 36:50.504
but, um...

36:50.539 --> 36:54.476
You're not my patient.
You're my daughter.

36:54.510 --> 36:57.079
I never really
understood emotionally

36:57.113 --> 37:00.315
what it felt to--
to be you.

37:02.218 --> 37:04.987
So, Danielle...

37:05.021 --> 37:07.121
I want you
to do your thing.

37:07.156 --> 37:10.992
I don't think
that's a good idea.

37:11.026 --> 37:12.827
I want to know.

37:58.339 --> 38:00.973
I--

38:01.008 --> 38:04.009
oh, I don't know
what to say.

38:10.818 --> 38:12.419
Then it worked.

38:40.615 --> 38:42.382
Dr. Rosen?

38:44.085 --> 38:45.885
I'm Stanton Parish.

38:53.640 --> 38:55.741
Your daughter's fine.

38:55.775 --> 38:59.979
Nothing to worry about.
I came alone.

39:00.014 --> 39:03.683
So, tell me, doctor,

39:03.717 --> 39:07.587
how does it feel
to be living your dreams?

39:07.622 --> 39:10.056
You've always wanted to be
on the cutting edge,

39:10.091 --> 39:11.524
to make your mark in history.

39:11.559 --> 39:12.859
You've achieved that.

39:12.894 --> 39:14.628
By helping you
purge Red Flag

39:14.662 --> 39:17.898
of everyone not in lockstep
with your plans?

39:17.933 --> 39:19.133
You're upset about that.

39:19.167 --> 39:21.235
Now, be honest.

39:21.270 --> 39:23.638
Secrecy serves us all.

39:23.673 --> 39:25.474
You want to protect
your team.

39:25.508 --> 39:29.144
Government wouldn't know what
to do if this went public.

39:29.179 --> 39:31.714
And for now...

39:31.748 --> 39:33.983
I operate best in the dark.

39:34.018 --> 39:36.986
Obviously not everyone
in Red Flag agrees with you.

39:37.021 --> 39:39.622
Hmm, troublemakers.

39:39.657 --> 39:42.158
You and I--
we put an end to them.

39:42.192 --> 39:45.927
That coldness,
that complete lack of empathy--

39:45.962 --> 39:48.830
it's just what I expected
your downside to be.

39:48.865 --> 39:50.398
So what else?

39:50.433 --> 39:51.966
You don't age.

39:52.001 --> 39:53.634
You probably
don't even get sick.

39:53.669 --> 39:55.136
I doubt you even sleep.

39:55.170 --> 39:56.471
Think beyond Alpha.

39:56.505 --> 39:59.840
I have complete
control of my mind--

39:59.875 --> 40:01.642
perfect brain-body connection.

40:01.677 --> 40:03.511
At the cost
of your humanity.

40:03.545 --> 40:05.950
I am humanity...

40:05.951 --> 40:07.819
What humanity will become.

40:07.960 --> 40:09.794
The future belongs
to people like me,

40:09.828 --> 40:12.030
and certainly we can agree
on that.

40:12.064 --> 40:14.032
Hey, you can stop
trying to manipulate me

40:14.066 --> 40:15.600
into feeling
that we share an agenda,

40:15.634 --> 40:17.369
some kind of connection.

40:17.403 --> 40:19.905
I'm every bit as good
at that as you.

40:19.939 --> 40:22.207
Oh, but we do
have a connection.

40:22.241 --> 40:23.708
That we both use people?

40:23.743 --> 40:26.878
But for completely
different ends.

40:26.912 --> 40:29.180
No, we don't share
a damn thing.

40:29.215 --> 40:31.716
You advocate
bloodshed and war.

40:31.751 --> 40:33.818
War...

40:33.853 --> 40:36.821
It's inevitable,
in two years, maybe three--

40:36.856 --> 40:39.757
nothing that you or I
can do to stop that.

40:39.792 --> 40:43.061
You'll forgive me
if I try.

40:43.095 --> 40:44.930
You're wasting
your talents, Lee.

40:44.964 --> 40:46.598
You're so close
to understanding it all.

40:46.632 --> 40:49.500
The answers to the questions
you've been asking

40:49.535 --> 40:50.801
ever since you realized

40:50.836 --> 40:54.606
that your daughter
was different.

40:54.640 --> 40:56.674
The biology of Alphas...

40:56.709 --> 40:59.944
The great mystery
of the human brain...

40:59.978 --> 41:01.712
I can get you there.

41:03.882 --> 41:06.083
And in return?

41:06.117 --> 41:08.685
I have so many plans
on the verge of fruition.

41:08.720 --> 41:10.420
You can help with that.

41:10.454 --> 41:12.989
People die
because of your plans.

41:13.023 --> 41:14.557
I've helped you enough.

41:14.591 --> 41:16.892
Think about it.

41:16.927 --> 41:18.693
You'll come around.

41:22.665 --> 41:26.502
When I first discovered
the Alpha phenomenon,

41:26.536 --> 41:29.305
I was just a doctor treating
a group of remarkable patients.

41:29.340 --> 41:32.375
Since then,
events have unfolded

41:32.409 --> 41:34.410
in ways that no one
could have predicted,

41:34.445 --> 41:36.446
starting with the emergence
of Red Flag.

41:36.480 --> 41:38.949
Here, straight
from Klauswerks.

41:38.983 --> 41:40.151
Thanks, Gary.

41:40.185 --> 41:42.553
Hey, and don't forget
to shave, all right?

41:42.587 --> 41:44.822
- It is Congress, after all.
- Oh, Rachel.

41:44.856 --> 41:48.540
Red Flag, is a radical
Alpha organization

41:48.541 --> 41:50.509
which is willing
to do anything,

41:50.775 --> 41:53.277
even commit murder,
to advance its cause.

41:53.311 --> 41:55.479
Cameron, Dani's at my house.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.248
Will you look in on her
from time to time?

41:57.282 --> 41:58.449
Yeah, I'll keep her safe.

41:58.483 --> 42:00.951
Now, the government's response
to their actions

42:00.985 --> 42:03.253
has been understandably swift
and aggressive...

42:03.288 --> 42:06.090
Good luck.

42:06.124 --> 42:08.626
Come here.

42:10.329 --> 42:13.263
Gathering intelligence,
deploying tactical units,

42:13.298 --> 42:17.768
and even using
my own covert team of Alphas.

42:17.802 --> 42:19.503
But despite all efforts,

42:19.538 --> 42:23.141
the situation has become
increasingly unstable,

42:23.176 --> 42:26.578
culminating with the incident
at Highland Mills.

42:26.613 --> 42:30.183
Those responsible
for the group's violent ideology

42:30.217 --> 42:31.885
are still out there.

42:31.919 --> 42:34.254
Indeed, their founder
and leader,

42:34.288 --> 42:37.591
Stanton Parish,
is still at large.

42:37.625 --> 42:40.460
I, uh, understand
your concern, Dr. Rosen.

42:40.494 --> 42:42.495
And we're willing
to provide you

42:42.529 --> 42:44.597
with as many tactical teams
as you need.

42:44.631 --> 42:47.833
I believe that Binghamton
is nowhere near capacity.

42:47.867 --> 42:49.601
Am I right?

42:49.635 --> 42:53.179
- Yes, uh, Binghamton--
I was coming to that.

42:55.800 --> 42:58.170
A clandestine prison hospital.

42:59.361 --> 43:01.391
Where Alphas are
confined and subjected

43:01.895 --> 43:04.708
to experiments,
without any respect paid

43:04.730 --> 43:06.964
to their civil rights
or their humanity.

43:06.999 --> 43:08.599
Binghamton is not the answer.

43:08.634 --> 43:12.759
Binghamton
is part of the problem.

43:12.793 --> 43:17.825
Red Flag and the government's
Alpha program

43:17.860 --> 43:19.458
are two sides
of the same coin.

43:19.492 --> 43:22.386
They both rely,
all too frequently,

43:22.421 --> 43:24.589
on violence and secrecy,

43:24.624 --> 43:28.429
abuses that can only thrive
in the dark...

43:28.463 --> 43:32.160
Son of a bitch is actually
gonna go through with this.

43:32.195 --> 43:33.893
Thank you, Dr. Rosen.

43:33.927 --> 43:35.460
That's very interesting.
Thank you for your time.

43:35.492 --> 43:36.657
Which is precisely

43:36.692 --> 43:38.491
what their leader,
Stanton Parish, wants--

43:38.526 --> 43:40.059
darkness.

43:40.093 --> 43:42.462
And by our keeping
the Alpha phenomenon a secret,

43:42.498 --> 43:44.598
we are only following
a path--

43:44.632 --> 43:47.870
his path, which I believe
can only lead to a war.

43:47.904 --> 43:50.073
So what I am advocating,
Senator,

43:50.107 --> 43:53.040
is not more money
or more guns

43:53.075 --> 43:55.342
or even a bigger prison.

43:55.376 --> 43:58.347
I am calling for light,

43:58.381 --> 44:00.149
for transparency,

44:00.183 --> 44:02.086
an end to secrets.

44:02.120 --> 44:06.623
And so I say
to all of you here...

44:06.657 --> 44:09.360
and to all of you watching,
Alphas exist.

44:09.394 --> 44:11.496
They are among us.

44:11.530 --> 44:15.033
They are our friends
and our spouses.

44:15.067 --> 44:16.700
They are our sons
and daughters.

44:16.725 --> 44:18.125
Our neighbors, our co-workers.

44:18.137 --> 44:19.420
This just got complicated.

44:19.421 --> 44:21.321
They are indeed us,
and they are not going away.

44:21.356 --> 44:22.555
Order!

44:22.590 --> 44:23.890
This is what
we have been hiding.

44:23.924 --> 44:25.123
Turn his microphone off,

44:25.157 --> 44:26.651
and I don't want this
on the record!

44:26.676 --> 44:28.675
This is what
we have been hiding.

44:29.560 --> 44:32.561
- I warned you.
- Yes.

44:34.027 --> 44:35.106
Yes, you did.

44:35.107 --> 44:38.738
Sharing this truth
may make things messier,

44:38.739 --> 44:40.140
more complicated.

44:40.175 --> 44:43.510
But it will hold both sides
accountable for their actions.

44:43.544 --> 44:45.712
And it will also prevent
this war...

44:45.746 --> 44:46.847
Security!

44:46.881 --> 44:48.850
Stanton Parish
so badly wants.

44:48.884 --> 44:51.386
And by sharing this truth,
it's time for everyone...

44:51.420 --> 44:53.021
Hurry up, security,
get this man out of here!

44:53.055 --> 44:56.291
To open their eyes,
to open their minds,

44:56.326 --> 44:57.426
and to open their--
