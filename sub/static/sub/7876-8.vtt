00:32.794 --> 00:34.407
Steve, is that Irish Spring?

00:34.577 --> 00:35.945
Smells great,

00:36.070 --> 00:37.261
super foresty.

00:37.386 --> 00:40.498
Thanks. I've been using it so long
I don't even notice it anymore.

00:50.663 --> 00:54.005
- Look at Steve Smith.
- Is it supposed to be curved like that?

00:55.126 --> 00:56.681
Get that thing straightened out!

01:01.924 --> 01:04.674
What are they talking about?
It's not curved. Is it, fellas?

01:04.799 --> 01:07.357
All right, first, I'm not looking down.
And second,

01:07.526 --> 01:09.457
they're talking about your spine.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.225
You've got scoliosis.

01:11.365 --> 01:13.365
What?
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

01:13.490 --> 01:14.490
I tried.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.178
I keep dropping hints.

01:16.303 --> 01:18.494
I even started
calling you Steve-iosis.

01:18.619 --> 01:19.870
Not to my face.

01:20.039 --> 01:21.585
No, behind your back.

01:21.873 --> 01:24.103
Behind your creepy, deformed back.

01:27.431 --> 01:29.243
There it is, pretty as a picture:

01:29.368 --> 01:30.431
scoliosis.

01:30.556 --> 01:31.882
What do we do, amputate?

01:32.121 --> 01:34.050
Actually, all he needs
is a back support.

01:34.220 --> 01:36.378
That doesn't sound so bad.

01:36.621 --> 01:38.748
Is it like one of those belts
weightlifters wear

01:38.873 --> 01:40.933
at the Olympics so they don't blow out
their rectums?

01:41.225 --> 01:42.305
Not exactly.

01:42.871 --> 01:45.372
Pretty great, huh?
I call her the "Chick Magnet",

01:45.497 --> 01:49.024
ironically, of course.
No, no girl wants any of that!

01:53.530 --> 01:56.046
All right, we're all packed.
You ready to go, Francine?

01:56.171 --> 01:58.232
How can I spend a week at a spa

01:58.357 --> 02:02.037
when I've just learned
that my son has a horrible deformity?

02:02.206 --> 02:04.257
Mom, I don't think
it's a "horrible deformity".

02:04.382 --> 02:07.687
So sweet,
trying to make me feel better.

02:08.110 --> 02:09.299
Mom, we have to go.

02:09.424 --> 02:12.646
How often does Roger win free passes
to a first-class spa?

02:12.771 --> 02:15.738
- Once isn't enough?
- No, I meant it as a good thing.

02:15.863 --> 02:17.524
Well, that's not how it sounded.

02:17.649 --> 02:20.039
You have a way about you,
Hayley, that just...

02:20.599 --> 02:21.598
turns me off.

02:21.803 --> 02:24.761
- Mom, it's fine. Just go.
- Well, okay.

02:24.992 --> 02:26.979
I mean, it's not like it's my fault.

02:27.104 --> 02:29.672
Your father was the one
who threw footballs at my stomach

02:29.797 --> 02:32.099
when I was pregnant
so you'd be good at sports.

02:32.224 --> 02:34.111
Instead it just made you a cripple.

02:34.583 --> 02:36.822
- Bye!
- Don't eat my yogurt!

02:37.868 --> 02:40.067
Dad, there is no way I'm wearing...

02:40.557 --> 02:42.522
And look, we can hang
your allergy pills here,

02:42.647 --> 02:45.956
your asthma inhaler there, and... Wait.
How are you gonna go to the bathroom?

02:46.124 --> 02:48.198
I know. I'll just insert a catheter.

02:51.513 --> 02:52.725
Rise and shi...!

02:53.233 --> 02:56.173
- Steve, what are you doing?
- I wanted a glass of water.

02:56.298 --> 02:58.365
I've been down here since midnight.

02:58.619 --> 03:00.804
There we go.
Now, let's get you ready for school.

03:00.985 --> 03:02.998
No way. It's social suicide.

03:03.123 --> 03:05.265
- I'm not going.
- Steve, sit down.

03:12.236 --> 03:15.112
Son, in life, it's not
what's on the outside that matters.

03:15.237 --> 03:18.049
It's what's on the inside.
No one cares how you look.

03:18.174 --> 03:19.988
- Come on, Dad.
- I'm serious.

03:20.113 --> 03:22.106
In fact, you should be proud
of your deformities.

03:22.231 --> 03:24.965
Look at little Helen Keller.
Deaf, dumb, and blind,

03:25.090 --> 03:28.191
and she wrote that whole diary
in her attic during World War II.

03:28.316 --> 03:30.167
She doesn't sound so dumb to me.

03:40.119 --> 03:41.637
Different!

03:43.141 --> 03:44.014
Freak.

03:48.690 --> 03:49.519
Snot?

03:50.050 --> 03:51.878
I'm finally part of the group!

03:52.003 --> 03:53.398
Don't ruin this for me!

03:57.414 --> 03:59.864
I am so looking forward
to this week.

04:00.185 --> 04:03.091
- Why is your bag so light?
- Because you're not in it yet.

04:03.216 --> 04:05.202
You want me to get in your suitcase?

04:05.371 --> 04:07.500
That's how we're gonna sneak you
by the front desk.

04:07.625 --> 04:09.581
The radio station
only gave me two passes.

04:09.750 --> 04:10.999
Are you kidding me?

04:11.124 --> 04:13.321
- Then why did you invite both of us?
- Gee, I don't know.

04:13.446 --> 04:16.072
You think it might have something to do
with me being drunk all the time?

04:16.197 --> 04:18.128
I'm an alcoholic. I have a problem.

04:18.253 --> 04:20.947
I'm just not ready
to deal with it yet. But I will.

04:21.072 --> 04:22.072
I promise.

04:22.263 --> 04:25.130
No more empty promises.
No, sir. Not from this alcoholic.

04:25.255 --> 04:27.917
Now, hop in the suitcase
and first round's on me.

04:31.002 --> 04:34.607
- Are these balloons full of heroin?
- Those are not for you!

04:37.258 --> 04:38.819
Hi. Mr. Mustachios.

04:38.944 --> 04:40.699
And Mrs. Mustachios.

04:41.007 --> 04:42.507
Just the two of us.

04:42.632 --> 04:45.258
Right, our two radio
contest winners.

04:45.383 --> 04:48.162
- Who's the big Nickelback fan?
- Guilty!

04:48.384 --> 04:51.624
Well, you're lucky.
We normally charge 1,800 bucks a head.

04:51.824 --> 04:55.052
And what if I gave you $1,800
and five cents?

04:55.322 --> 04:58.323
Why, I'd give you a nickel back!

04:58.448 --> 05:01.529
- You knew where I was headed!
- I did!

05:05.388 --> 05:06.931
I told you we'd be fine.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.906
Stupid mean kids with their...

05:14.151 --> 05:15.977
beautiful straight spines.

05:16.327 --> 05:17.608
Oh, Dad's home.

05:18.042 --> 05:19.945
He can't be mad at me
for leaving school early.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.488
He'll understand when he sees
what I've endured.

05:23.126 --> 05:25.786
Dad, I know it's only
what's on the inside that matters,

05:25.911 --> 05:27.785
but I'm just not as strong as...

05:30.878 --> 05:32.118
You're bald?

05:32.830 --> 05:35.028
There's a kid
on the football team with cancer

05:35.153 --> 05:37.915
so the whole defensive line shaved
our heads in solidarity.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.659
It actually works out great
during two-a-days, keeps your head cool.

05:40.784 --> 05:42.795
- What?
- That was just nonsense. I'm bald.

05:42.920 --> 05:45.910
I can't believe it!
How long have you been hiding this?

05:46.035 --> 05:48.362
Well, it all started in high school.

05:52.481 --> 05:54.125
It all started in high school.

05:56.970 --> 06:00.604
I had horrific acne
and was ridiculed mercilessly for it.

06:01.226 --> 06:04.638
I tried everything to get rid of it,
but nothing seemed to work.

06:06.415 --> 06:08.664
When it came time for college,
I saw an opportunity

06:08.789 --> 06:12.432
to reinvent myself and give myself
a second chance for a happy life.

06:12.557 --> 06:15.635
So I decided to be the guinea pig
for a new acne drug.

06:16.246 --> 06:17.747
It worked perfectly.

06:22.174 --> 06:25.009
My first day of college was
the best day of my life.

06:25.956 --> 06:27.787
My second day was the worst.

06:28.408 --> 06:30.847
The acne medicine caused
your hair to fall out!

06:32.237 --> 06:33.375
How did you know?

06:33.500 --> 06:36.150
You're telling a story
about how you went bald.

06:36.608 --> 06:38.437
It would been nice
if you let me finish.

06:38.562 --> 06:39.800
- Go ahead.
- I will.

06:40.379 --> 06:43.360
Apparently, a side effect of the acne
treatment was total loss of...

06:43.528 --> 06:45.563
You know what, forget it.
The story's over.

06:45.688 --> 06:48.740
Dad, I don't understand.
Why do you wear a wig?

06:48.910 --> 06:51.110
Because the hair gave me confidence.

06:51.419 --> 06:54.095
And I was able to parlay that confidence
into meeting your mother,

06:54.220 --> 06:56.498
starting a family,
and getting a job at the CIA.

06:56.667 --> 06:59.692
- Wait, Mom doesn't even know?
- Of course not. No one does.

06:59.817 --> 07:02.545
Especially not your mother.
She'd lose all interest in me.

07:02.756 --> 07:06.759
She loves my hair. She tells me
every time we're ba-ba-bangin'!

07:06.884 --> 07:08.318
Ah, gross!

07:08.443 --> 07:11.507
Dad, you said the only thing
that matters is what's on the inside!

07:11.632 --> 07:13.941
Grow up! The outside's
the only thing that matters!

07:14.066 --> 07:15.691
Nobody cares what's on the inside!

07:15.816 --> 07:18.064
If they did, I would have married
that smart fat girl

07:18.189 --> 07:20.548
I used to have
all those deep conversations with.

07:20.876 --> 07:22.613
You're such a hypocrite.

07:26.761 --> 07:30.574
Roger, these treatments look amazing,
but I'm really nervous.

07:30.699 --> 07:32.945
- What if they catch us?
- They won't catch us.

07:33.070 --> 07:35.907
Look, we have two wristbands,
so two of us can be at the spa

07:36.032 --> 07:38.625
while the third one stays up here
trying on Hayley's clothes

07:38.750 --> 07:41.710
- and laughing at himself in the mirror.
- I guess we could take turns.

07:41.879 --> 07:43.202
Of course. It'll be easy.

07:43.327 --> 07:46.524
Now get over here and help me
finish this. Don't Portuguese out on me.

07:47.143 --> 07:49.620
I'm starting a new ethnic slur.
Did it take?

07:51.037 --> 07:52.273
Quiet! Quiet!

07:55.235 --> 07:56.888
Turlington, spa detective.

07:58.024 --> 07:59.660
I'm Mrs. Mustachios!

08:00.033 --> 08:02.801
That's quite a lot of food
for just the two of you.

08:05.188 --> 08:06.259
Still warm.

08:06.973 --> 08:07.730
So,

08:08.393 --> 08:09.905
- you're married?
- We sure are!

08:10.149 --> 08:11.907
That's sweet.
Kiss.

08:12.909 --> 08:16.036
I'm told it's not uncommon
for married persons to kiss.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.372
Kiss.

08:26.715 --> 08:29.054
It's okay.
We'll leave our underwear on.

08:30.103 --> 08:32.760
Honey, not in front
of the detective.

08:34.164 --> 08:36.568
All right.
Everything checks out here...

08:37.168 --> 08:38.168
for now.

08:40.227 --> 08:42.607
That was so close!
I think he's on to us!

08:42.732 --> 08:45.073
Get in your suitcase and don't come out
till you hear me say,

08:45.198 --> 08:47.109
"I'm done. Go clean up.
You disgust me."

08:49.984 --> 08:51.667
Stupid... brace!

08:52.192 --> 08:54.490
- Hey, buddy.
- What do you want?

08:54.673 --> 08:57.119
Look, I know you're a little miffed
with your old man,

08:57.244 --> 08:59.849
but I got something
that's gonna make everything all right.

08:59.974 --> 09:01.195
Stickers!

09:01.486 --> 09:05.483
Look, what we got here:
Dora the Explorer, a puffy unicorn, and,

09:06.078 --> 09:08.890
- looks like you're a Chiquita bana!
- Dad, stop!

09:09.015 --> 09:11.080
I also got you a rearview mirror!

09:11.746 --> 09:15.185
Trying to pass on the left! I know
it's safe because I see that you see me!

09:15.310 --> 09:16.627
Knock it off already!

09:17.539 --> 09:19.652
"Warning: Driver Has PMS."

09:21.430 --> 09:22.853
Dad, just leave me alone.

09:23.022 --> 09:24.429
Steve, come on.

09:24.554 --> 09:27.201
You know, I might have left
school early yesterday,

09:27.326 --> 09:28.804
but I did learn something:

09:28.929 --> 09:31.075
where I got my weak backbone from.

09:32.711 --> 09:36.711
Caution: Objects in mirror
may be sadder than they appear.

09:41.183 --> 09:43.185
Forget it, Dad.
I'm not going to school.

09:43.310 --> 09:44.443
That's fine. I just...

09:44.568 --> 09:48.003
thought you might want to say good-bye
to your old man before he goes to work.

09:49.828 --> 09:51.872
You're going to work... bald?

09:51.997 --> 09:55.047
I'd rather be bald than be a hypocrite
in the eyes of my son.

09:55.185 --> 09:57.420
Really?
You'd do this for me?

09:58.077 --> 10:01.125
We're gonna go out there
and face the world as we are.

10:01.250 --> 10:04.300
You know, I think people
might just surprise us.

10:06.409 --> 10:08.974
It was so awful!
They called me everything:

10:09.099 --> 10:11.442
Chrome Dome, Baldy, Cue Ball,

10:11.567 --> 10:13.417
Leukemia Skywalker!

10:13.542 --> 10:15.380
There, there. It's okay.

10:15.505 --> 10:16.905
It was relentless!

10:17.159 --> 10:19.838
Turns out a lot of high-level,
neo-conservative Republicans

10:19.963 --> 10:22.505
in the intelligence community
can be very mean!

10:22.630 --> 10:24.651
Someone drew three dots
on your head?

10:24.776 --> 10:27.331
Those are the finger holes
in my bowling ball.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.945
The Secretary of Energy did that!

10:30.442 --> 10:31.629
So, how was your day?

10:31.818 --> 10:35.184
Well, this sophomore girl got killed
in a drunk driving accident

10:35.309 --> 10:37.717
and we spent the afternoon sharing
our thoughts about her.

10:37.842 --> 10:41.055
Took the focus right off my brace,
so yeah, it was a pretty good day.

10:41.259 --> 10:42.369
You're lucky.

10:42.494 --> 10:45.885
Work was awful, but it doesn't
even matter 'cause I'm not going back!

10:46.010 --> 10:49.035
- I'm never going back!
- Dad, the worst part's over.

10:49.160 --> 10:51.698
There's nothing they can do to you
that hasn't already been done.

10:51.823 --> 10:54.504
- I guess.
- Look, Dad, I trusted you.

10:54.861 --> 10:57.161
Now it's time for you to trust me.

10:58.074 --> 11:01.207
- For supper, will you make me...?
- I will make you Mickey Mouse pancakes.

11:04.980 --> 11:06.363
The devil invented stress,

11:06.488 --> 11:09.418
but God struck back
with the sandalwood foot scrub.

11:10.467 --> 11:11.752
What... What are you doing?

11:11.922 --> 11:14.768
We're leaving. We're sick of having
to share just one wristband.

11:14.893 --> 11:18.135
Yeah, all this sneaking around
is not relaxing at all.

11:18.304 --> 11:20.904
Okay. Go ahead.
Walk right through the lobby.

11:21.289 --> 11:24.082
But what if that detective sees you
with someone other than me?

11:24.207 --> 11:26.081
It'll cost you 1,800 bucks.

11:26.206 --> 11:28.103
Look, they brought my daily turkey.

11:28.271 --> 11:31.110
He's right. How are we going
to get past Turlington?

11:33.240 --> 11:34.067
Delicious.

11:35.244 --> 11:36.819
Sorry you're leaving so soon.

11:38.559 --> 11:41.272
- Let me help you with your bag.
- No, I don't need your help!

11:41.397 --> 11:43.785
I mean, I decided to stay!

11:44.238 --> 11:45.722
Thanks just the same!

11:45.994 --> 11:49.458
Turlington, six more cans of pistachios
have gone missing.

11:49.649 --> 11:52.090
Too many people have a key
to the pistachio closet.

11:52.846 --> 11:55.115
That's what you said four weeks ago.

11:55.240 --> 11:58.717
I can't help but think your father
would've had this case solved by now.

11:59.561 --> 12:01.090
Sorry, Mr. Chimdale.

12:04.176 --> 12:06.267
Hey, Lorraine,
do you know what this is?

12:06.392 --> 12:08.968
- Is that a bird balloon?
- It's an eagle, Lorraine.

12:09.093 --> 12:10.218
A bald eagle.

12:10.343 --> 12:12.408
Proud and majestic, like my father.

12:12.533 --> 12:14.815
Who I think could use
a little cheering up today.

12:20.985 --> 12:24.609
Okay, this flight suit can withstand
200 miles of wind force.

12:25.476 --> 12:27.384
He's wearing his hair.

12:27.611 --> 12:28.869
He lied to me!

12:32.335 --> 12:35.931
I will now attempt a simple coordination
test with these blocks.

12:38.566 --> 12:41.259
I will now attempt
to poop out these blocks.

12:46.593 --> 12:47.870
<i>You lied to me!</i>

12:48.913 --> 12:50.476
<i>I saw you in the wind tunnel.</i>

12:50.601 --> 12:52.559
<i>This whole week
I've been getting my ass kicked</i>

12:52.684 --> 12:54.606
<i>because you said
we were in this together!</i>

12:55.216 --> 12:57.915
- Son, now take it easy.
- <i>I will not take it easy!</i>

12:58.040 --> 12:59.979
<i>And you know
who else won't take it easy?</i>

13:00.104 --> 13:02.147
<i>Mom! When I tell her you're bald!</i>

13:02.272 --> 13:03.540
You wouldn't dare.

13:03.665 --> 13:06.176
<i>I'm on my way to Chimdale right now!</i>

13:07.607 --> 13:08.950
You poor, naive,

13:09.075 --> 13:11.794
crooked-backed SOB.
Who's your mother going to believe?

13:11.919 --> 13:14.250
Her faithful husband
or the son she didn't want?

13:15.094 --> 13:16.670
- <i>She didn't want me?</i>
- No, she did.

13:16.795 --> 13:19.631
But you believed me just now.
When I tell your mother you're lying,

13:19.799 --> 13:22.828
she'll believe me, too.
I can be very convincing.

13:24.434 --> 13:27.262
The Secretary of Energy drew
a bowling ball on my head!

13:29.056 --> 13:31.486
- <i>You're a monster!</i>
- And you're in over your head.

13:31.611 --> 13:32.924
<i>I don't think so, Dad.</i>

13:33.049 --> 13:35.292
<i>'Cause I've got something you don't.</i>

13:35.799 --> 13:37.088
<i>Your hair!</i>

13:39.362 --> 13:41.895
You know, Steve,
I don't say it often enough,

13:42.590 --> 13:46.528
- but I love you.
- <i>And the Oscar goes to... someone else!</i>

13:46.741 --> 13:48.535
Damn it. When I find you,
I'll kill you!

14:05.441 --> 14:08.077
- Roger, where do you keep your wigs?
- Why should I tell you?

14:08.202 --> 14:10.163
Because I need
to get them appraised.

14:10.288 --> 14:12.980
- For insurance purposes.
- Finally. Thank you.

14:13.105 --> 14:15.115
Some of them are on tour
with Angela Lansbury

14:15.240 --> 14:16.897
and the rest are down
in my wig cellar.

14:19.855 --> 14:21.318
Do you have any men's wigs?

14:21.815 --> 14:25.489
I got a David Spade/Ellen DeGeneres.
I don't know if it's clean.

14:27.606 --> 14:29.506
Hey, look!
It's Owen Wilson!

14:30.794 --> 14:32.777
Oh, my neck is killing me.

14:33.045 --> 14:35.794
Being trapped in this room
is stressing me out.

14:35.919 --> 14:37.042
Look, Frannie.

14:37.436 --> 14:40.610
I know you're hurting. I just want you
to know I'm here for you and...

14:41.770 --> 14:43.132
Oh, my God.

14:43.982 --> 14:45.471
I think you fixed it.

14:48.471 --> 14:49.227
Mom?

14:49.352 --> 14:51.048
I don't understand.
It should've worked.

14:51.173 --> 14:52.953
I learned that move
from a chiropractor

14:53.078 --> 14:55.104
in his van in the alley
behind the 7-11...

14:55.229 --> 14:56.895
Boy, I think I raped a guy.

14:57.299 --> 14:59.677
There you go. This mud bath
will make you feel better.

14:59.802 --> 15:03.806
I should get back before somebody comes
and sees we only have 2 spa wristbands.

15:04.287 --> 15:05.028
Crap!

15:06.865 --> 15:08.155
Don't we look cozy.

15:09.178 --> 15:11.243
- Quite cozy.
- Think I'll join you.

15:13.156 --> 15:14.574
Forgot my locker key.

15:16.788 --> 15:17.709
Found it.

15:18.209 --> 15:19.806
It's bungeed to my wrist.

15:21.327 --> 15:23.054
Forgot my water bottle.

15:25.363 --> 15:27.050
Roger, she's suffocating!

15:27.175 --> 15:30.038
You want to pay the 1,800 bucks
if Turlington finds her?

15:30.163 --> 15:32.309
- Big breath, sweetie.
- But...

15:37.746 --> 15:38.772
There we go.

15:39.123 --> 15:40.737
I guess I misjudged you folks.

15:40.996 --> 15:43.411
I thought you were trying
to hide something.

15:43.669 --> 15:45.716
Us? Oh, that's so silly!

15:48.187 --> 15:49.707
- She bit me!
- What?

15:51.502 --> 15:54.910
You were going
to let me die for $1,800?

15:57.189 --> 15:59.377
There's three of you.

15:59.502 --> 16:01.792
Fine, you got us.
We're busted!

16:02.002 --> 16:04.621
Well, we might be able to work
something out if you're...

16:04.746 --> 16:06.171
wantin' to do something for me.

16:06.378 --> 16:09.521
- You girls head up to the room.
- I don't want you to have to see this.

16:09.646 --> 16:11.198
That won't be necessary.

16:12.253 --> 16:13.305
Then... what?

16:13.615 --> 16:16.317
I need you to help me catch
this pistachio thief.

16:16.442 --> 16:20.048
I've been over this case every which way
and nothing makes sense.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.359
I've even rounded up
all the keys to the closet.

16:22.484 --> 16:24.378
So now there's only two people
that have one:

16:24.503 --> 16:25.520
Me and...

16:26.587 --> 16:27.752
Mr. Chimdale?

16:29.697 --> 16:30.886
Well done, Ron.

16:31.011 --> 16:34.279
I knew I had to devise
the most difficult case in spa history

16:34.404 --> 16:38.245
to make you into the greatest spa
detective since your father.

16:38.700 --> 16:40.540
And now you are.

16:48.790 --> 16:49.682
Daddy?

16:50.014 --> 16:51.616
Did you hear that, Daddy?

16:55.627 --> 16:58.131
I just miss him so much.

16:58.256 --> 16:59.726
We all do, son.

17:01.997 --> 17:03.030
We all do.

17:03.908 --> 17:05.078
This is crazy.

17:05.203 --> 17:06.203
I know!

17:06.510 --> 17:09.251
Pistachios rhymes with Mustachios!

17:10.262 --> 17:12.535
Honey, you tire me.

17:16.378 --> 17:18.271
<i>I'm almost to Mom, sucker!</i>

17:18.396 --> 17:21.085
<i>I can already smell
the Chimdale salt flats.</i>

17:21.210 --> 17:23.904
- How are you getting to Chimdale?
- <i>That's for me to know</i>

17:24.029 --> 17:27.153
- <i>and you to find out.</i>
- Steve, please, I'm begging you!

17:34.866 --> 17:37.598
Behold, Mother!
Your husband is a giant...

17:38.208 --> 17:40.355
Wait a minute. This isn't Chimdale.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.652
Oh, brownies!

17:49.133 --> 17:51.528
I'll say hello to Chimdale for you!

17:54.117 --> 17:55.084
Damn it!

17:56.539 --> 17:58.193
Official CIA business.

18:10.432 --> 18:13.299
- Give me back my hair, Steve!
- Not a chance!

18:18.973 --> 18:20.715
You just missed the exit!

18:20.840 --> 18:23.101
Smooth move, bald-lax!

18:32.947 --> 18:34.496
Hello, good sir.

18:34.621 --> 18:37.360
Would you mind dropping me off
at the Chimdale Spa?

18:37.498 --> 18:39.924
All right, but I'm getting
some ribs first.

18:40.049 --> 18:41.936
What are you doing?
I don't have time for ribs!

18:42.061 --> 18:46.063
You don't have time
for the best barbecue ribs in the state?

18:47.113 --> 18:49.750
Are we talking cue right now?
We talking cue?

18:49.875 --> 18:52.098
'Cause I got news for you.
I only know two things:

18:52.223 --> 18:54.060
perpetual virginity and ribs.

18:54.185 --> 18:57.330
And the best ribs in the state are
at Way Crazy's in Langley Falls.

18:57.455 --> 18:59.815
Please, my mother's
a Baptist minister

18:59.940 --> 19:02.855
and she wouldn't scrub
her ass with Way Crazy's.

19:04.436 --> 19:06.617
Yo mama sounds
like a messed-up bitch.

19:09.099 --> 19:11.319
You were right
about those ribs, Justin.

19:11.444 --> 19:14.547
But I'm pretty sure
the Jews didn't know about 9/11.

19:22.712 --> 19:23.623
Got it!

19:23.948 --> 19:26.197
You almost had your old man, Steve.

19:26.322 --> 19:28.208
But it's time for you to go home.

19:28.515 --> 19:29.897
Fine, I'll go home.

19:30.325 --> 19:31.628
But just know this:

19:31.844 --> 19:33.463
you may have kept your hair...

19:33.726 --> 19:35.389
but you lost your son.

19:36.824 --> 19:38.019
Damn, Steve.

19:38.576 --> 19:39.576
Son, wait!

19:40.201 --> 19:41.263
You're right.

19:41.388 --> 19:43.389
Nothing's worth losing you.

19:43.654 --> 19:44.683
Not even...

19:45.284 --> 19:46.226
my hair.

19:46.640 --> 19:49.652
- What are you doing?
- Showing your mother the real me.

19:59.856 --> 20:02.955
You were supposed to stop me!
The gesture should've been enough!

20:03.080 --> 20:05.939
Come on. Give me a break! You only
have to wear that brace for six weeks.

20:06.064 --> 20:08.331
This is permanent!
What do you want from me?

20:08.657 --> 20:11.375
Dad, all I want is for you
to be the man

20:11.585 --> 20:13.211
that you're asking me to be.

20:14.458 --> 20:15.568
Damn, Steve.

20:19.335 --> 20:21.052
Stan? Where's your hair?

20:21.273 --> 20:22.540
I don't have any.

20:22.665 --> 20:24.088
I am bald.

20:24.213 --> 20:26.181
I know. I mean, where's your wig?

20:26.587 --> 20:28.150
- What?
- Your wig.

20:28.275 --> 20:29.893
You're not wearing it.
Where is it?

20:30.149 --> 20:31.899
You mean you knew?

20:32.024 --> 20:34.149
- Yeah, we all knew.
- I didn't know!

20:34.274 --> 20:36.567
Our general thinking was
that you might overreact.

20:36.776 --> 20:38.528
I can't believe you knew.

20:38.840 --> 20:41.543
I wasted all that time
being ashamed for nothing?

20:43.715 --> 20:46.565
Here, Roger, I guess
you can add this to your collection.

20:48.307 --> 20:49.405
Thank you.

20:51.781 --> 20:53.908
So now I'm going to be bald forever.

20:54.033 --> 20:56.295
And I'm going to be
a better man in your eyes for it.

20:56.471 --> 20:58.314
- No, not really.
- What?

20:58.539 --> 21:00.340
It doesn't matter to us
if you've got hair.

21:00.657 --> 21:02.885
Yeah, Stan, I'm bald,
and I made out with your wife.

21:03.094 --> 21:03.927
What?

00:00.500 --> 00:10.000
