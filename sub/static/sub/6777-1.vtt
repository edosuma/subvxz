05:32.160 --> 05:34.355

05:36.530 --> 05:39.988
GODDAMNIT, DAVID, I TOLD YOU
I WANTED TO BE CREMATED.

05:46.780 --> 05:50.546
COME ON, NATE,

GOAT.

06:50.170 --> 06:51.068
GO...

06:51.170 --> 06:54.105
LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

07:01.050 --> 07:02.347
GO--O.

07:02.450 --> 07:05.487
( baby cooing )

07:10.790 --> 07:13.020
SHE'S DEFINITELY
GOT YOUR NOSE,

07:13.130 --> 07:16.156
AND YOUR EYES.

07:16.260 --> 07:19.263
LOOK AT THAT FACE.

07:19.370 --> 07:22.601
LOOK AT THIS LITI'LE
PERSON WE CREATED.

07:22.710 --> 07:26.168
I LOVE IT WHEN
SHE DOES THAT.

07:26.270 --> 07:28.534
WHEN SHE
SORT OF JERKS ?

07:28.640 --> 07:30.608
RIGHT BEFORE SHE
FALLS OFF TO SLEEP ?

07:30.710 --> 07:32.712
AND THEN
WAKES HERSELF UP ?

07:32.820 --> 07:35.345
YOU FREAKED OUT THE FIRST TIME
SHE EVER DID IT.

07:35.450 --> 07:38.419
I REMEMBER THAT
FEELING OF FALLING,

07:38.520 --> 07:42.524
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,
LIKE I WAS FALLING OUT OF BED,

07:42.630 --> 07:44.120
AND IT ALWAYS
WOKE ME UP.

07:44.230 --> 07:46.790
LIKE I WAS SCARED OF WHAT
I WAS GONNA FALL INTO,

07:46.900 --> 07:49.869
BUT...

07:49.970 --> 07:54.191
THAT NEVER HAPPENS
TO ME ANYMORE.

08:00.410 --> 08:02.605
GOD.

08:02.710 --> 08:05.178
WE LOSE SO MUCH,
YOU KNOW ?

08:05.280 --> 08:08.147
( door opening )

08:08.250 --> 08:10.218
OH, GREAT.

08:10.320 --> 08:13.414
OH, GREAT, HE'S GOT
THE HICCUPS AGAIN.

08:13.520 --> 08:14.817
SHAKE HIM
AND SCREAM IN HIS FACE.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.888
WHAT ?

08:16.990 --> 08:18.548
THE WORLD IS HOSTILE
AND TERRIFYING PLACE,

08:18.660 --> 08:19.991
HE NEEDS
TO LEARN THAT.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.590
IF YOUR MOTHER TALKS ABOUT
WHAT A GASSY BABY YOU WERE

08:21.700 --> 08:24.260
AND HIM GETTING THAT FROM YOU
AGAIN, I WILL SCREAM.

08:24.370 --> 08:25.792
I'LL START FARTING.

08:25.900 --> 08:27.538
THANK GOD WE GOT HIGH
BEFORE WE CAME.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.733
( clock bell )

08:29.840 --> 08:31.899
CALL ME CRAZY,
BUDDY BOY.

08:32.010 --> 08:34.808
BUT I DON'T THINK IT MAKES A
DAMN BIT OF DIFFERENCE WHO WON.

08:34.910 --> 08:36.070
THEY'RE ALL
CROOKS ANYWAY.

08:36.180 --> 08:37.738
HOW CAN YOU
NOT CARE ?

08:37.850 --> 08:39.477
I MEAN, WHAT ABOUT THAT
BULLSHIT "ACCEPTANCE" SPEECH

08:39.580 --> 08:41.411
LANGUAGE.
HE GAVE A COUPLE
OF WEEKS AGO--

08:41.520 --> 08:43.579
WHEN HE SAID "I WAS
NOT ELECTED TO SERVE
ONE PARTY BUT ONE NATION ?"

08:43.690 --> 08:45.339
YEAH, THE OPERATIVE WORDS
THERE BEING, "NOT ELECTED".

08:45.450 --> 08:47.008
YOU WANT
THE END PIECE ?

08:47.120 --> 08:48.155
I DON'T EAT
RED MEAT.

08:48.260 --> 08:49.887
I MADE YOU
A CHICKEN BREAST.

08:49.990 --> 08:51.526
NATE, IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SEE
GEORGE BUSH IN THE WHITE HOUSE,

08:51.630 --> 08:52.619
THEN YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
VOTED FOR RALPH NADER.

08:52.730 --> 08:54.652
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

08:54.760 --> 08:58.161
THE TRAFFIC WAS LIKE,
SEVERELY RIDICULOUS.

08:58.270 --> 08:59.862
RUTH.

08:59.970 --> 09:00.436
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.599
HERE YOU ARE.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.337
YOU DON'T LOOK WELL.

09:04.440 --> 09:05.862
I THINK I MIGHT BE
COMING DOWN WITH A COLD.

09:05.970 --> 09:08.279
OH, DEAR, LET ME
FEEL YOUR FOREHEAD.

09:08.380 --> 09:10.541
IT'S OKAY, MOM,
PEOPLE GET COLDS.

09:10.650 --> 09:12.504
ANYBODY WANT

09:12.620 --> 09:14.542

09:25.130 --> 09:27.496
MOTHER, ARE YOU TRYING
TO SABOTAGE MY DIET ?

09:27.600 --> 09:29.556
OF COURSE NOT,
TRISHA.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.093
I FULLY SUPPORT YOUR
COMMITMENT TO HATING YOURSELF

09:32.200 --> 09:34.395
FOR NOT HAVING THE ASS
OF A 10-YEAR-OLD BOY.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.468
( phone ringing )

09:36.570 --> 09:37.969
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
HAVE TO BE SO CRUDE ?

09:38.070 --> 09:40.004
BECAUSE GOD IS
PUNISHING YOU THROUGH ME.

09:40.110 --> 09:44.740
FISHER FUNERAL CHAPEL,
NATE FISHER SPEAKING.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.772
I'M SO
TERRIBLY SORRY.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.768
YES, WE ARE OPEN TODAY.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.383
AH, ANY TIME
BEFORE ELEVEN ?

09:51.490 --> 09:55.119
JUST ONCE I WISH WE COULD
MAKE IT THROUGH CHRISTMAS DINNER

09:55.220 --> 09:56.687
WITHOUT SOMEBODY DYING.

09:56.790 --> 09:58.587
WE'LL BE
WAITING FOR YOU.

09:58.690 --> 10:01.420
H EART A'I'I'ACK.

10:01.530 --> 10:02.895
THANK GOD
FOR SMALL FAVORS.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.821
AW, SHIT, I'VE SEEN
THIS ONE BEFORE.

10:05.930 --> 10:11.232
That was Doctor

10:11.340 --> 10:14.901

10:15.010 --> 10:16.329

10:19.780 --> 10:22.044

WHAT'S ON.

10:22.150 --> 10:24.414
QUIT FLAPPIN' YOUR TRAP,
I LIKE THIS SHOW.

10:24.520 --> 10:26.385
So...

10:26.490 --> 10:29.152
The u_niyerse
has split In two.

10:29.260 --> 10:30.682
Two ?

10:30.790 --> 10:32.929
Try two billion !

10:33.030 --> 10:34.895
( laughing )

10:35.000 --> 10:39.425
What's gonna
happen to us ?

10:39.530 --> 10:41.532
There, there.

10:41.640 --> 10:45.167
We always end up in a universe
in which we exist.

10:45.270 --> 10:48.034
Remember
Copenhagen ?

10:48.140 --> 10:49.949
( laughing )

10:50.050 --> 10:52.678
Ah, yes...

10:52.780 --> 10:55.977
The Eigenvalues in bloom.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.583
You just keep
telling yourself

10:58.690 --> 11:01.113
everything that
can happen, does...

11:01.220 --> 11:02.881
somewhere.

11:02.990 --> 11:05.151
OH SHIT, I SEEN

11:07.130 --> 11:09.155
YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

11:09.260 --> 11:12.388
I JUST NEED YOU TO ANSWER
A FEW QUESTIONS FOR ME.

11:13.700 --> 11:14.997
( glass breaking )

11:15.100 --> 11:16.931
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT
YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS

11:17.040 --> 11:19.770
AFFECT S THE BEHAVIOR
OF SUBATOMIC PARTICLES ?

11:19.880 --> 11:21.438
AM I ALIVE
OR AM I DEAD ?

11:21.540 --> 11:23.041
DO YOU BELIEVE PARTICLES MOVE
BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN TIME

11:23.150 --> 11:24.947
AND APPEAR IN ALL
POSSIBLE PLACES AT ONCE ?

11:25.050 --> 11:28.247
AND IF I AM DEAD,
IS THIS HEAVEN OR HELL ?

11:28.350 --> 11:30.045
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE UNIVERSE
IS CONSTANTLY SPLI'ITING

11:30.150 --> 11:32.209
INTO BILLIONS
OF PARALLEL UNIVERSES ?

11:32.320 --> 11:33.412
WHAT THE FUCK
DO I CARE ?!

11:33.520 --> 11:34.714
YOU ONLY
GET ONE CHOICE,

11:34.820 --> 11:36.082
SO, YOU MAY WANT
TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

11:36.190 --> 11:37.054
JUST TELL ME.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.684
AM I DEAD ?

11:38.790 --> 11:40.599
YES OR NO.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.965
YES...

11:47.340 --> 11:49.729
AND NO.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.762
SOME PLACES YOU'RE DEAD,
SOME PLACES YOU'RE ALIVE.

11:51.870 --> 11:53.269
SOME PLACES,
YOU NEVER EVEN EXISTED.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.837
POSSIBLY,
TH EORETICALLY.

11:55.940 --> 12:00.218
OR WHO KNOWS, THIS COULD
JUST BE THE ANESTHESIA TALKING.

12:03.150 --> 12:04.481
GO AHEAD.

12:04.590 --> 12:07.718
OPEN THE BOX.

12:10.190 --> 12:13.023
( rumbling )

12:16.230 --> 12:18.164
( chuckling )

12:18.730 --> 12:20.766
FUCK IT.

12:35.980 --> 12:38.517
NO, I NEVER
ACTUALLY FLAT-LINED,

12:38.620 --> 12:40.110
I JUST WOKE UP
AND LATER THEY TOLD ME

12:40.220 --> 12:42.518
THE AVM RUPTURED
DURING SURGERY.

12:42.620 --> 12:44.156
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
RUPTURED ?

12:44.260 --> 12:46.820
WELL, IT JUST,
YOU KNOW, EXPLODED.

12:46.930 --> 12:48.591
MY HEAD
ACTUALLY EXPLODED.

12:48.700 --> 12:51.919
I SHOULD'VE DIED, OR HAD SOME
KIND OF LASTING BRAIN DAMAGE,

12:52.030 --> 12:54.794
BUT I PULLED THROUGH
AND SEVEN MONTHS LATER

12:54.900 --> 12:56.629
NOTHING EVEN SHOWS UP
ON AN M.R.I.

12:56.740 --> 12:57.934
WOW.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.871
YOU'RE REALLY LUCKY.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.278
I AM SO FUCKING LUCKY.

13:02.380 --> 13:05.247
SO FUCKING LUCKY.

13:05.350 --> 13:07.545
RIGHT ?

13:07.650 --> 13:08.969
OH, THAT IS BEAUTIFUL.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.809
HIS DOESN'T
HAVE THE INLAY.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.444
WHERE DID YOU
GET THIS ?

13:12.550 --> 13:14.916
MY BOSS CAROL HAD TO HAVE
A LOT OF JEWELRY MADE

13:15.020 --> 13:16.214
FOR THIS KING ARTHUR
CABLE MOVIE ?

13:16.320 --> 13:19.050
SHE TURNED US ONTO
THE GUY WHO DID IT.

13:19.160 --> 13:21.890
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW FAST YOU TWO GOT MARRIED.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.888
IT WASN'T THAT FAST.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.025
WE'VE ACTUALLY
BEEN TOGETHER EIGHT YEARS.

13:26.130 --> 13:27.961
YOU KNOW,
ON AND OFF.

13:28.070 --> 13:30.368
BETWEEN HERE
AND SEATI'LE.

13:32.810 --> 13:34.869
WELL, YOU LOOK
REALLY HAPPY.

13:34.980 --> 13:38.177
GOOD.
I AM REALLY HAPPY.

13:38.280 --> 13:40.544
SO, MY SISTER-IN-LAW'S
AN ASTROLOGIST--

13:40.650 --> 13:41.912
AND A DRUNK.

13:42.020 --> 13:44.079
AND SHE WAS TELLING ME
ABOUT THIS WHOLE WEIRD THING

13:44.190 --> 13:45.384
THAT HER PROFESSION
IS FACING RIGHT NOW.

13:45.490 --> 13:48.084
WAIT, WHEN DID ASTROLOGY
BECOME A PROFESSION ?

13:48.190 --> 13:52.058
YOU KNOW,
WITH THE WHOLE POSSIBILITY
OF INTERPLANETARY TRAVEL ?

13:52.160 --> 13:53.798
THIS PASTA SALAD
IS SO GOOD,

13:53.900 --> 13:56.221
I WANT TO SPEND
A WEEKEND ALONE WITH IT.

13:56.330 --> 13:58.628
HONEY, THAT MAKES ME
FEEL A LITTLE WEIRD.

13:58.730 --> 14:01.460
OKAY, SO SAY IN YOUR CHART,
YOUR MARS IS IN SCORPIO,

14:01.570 --> 14:04.004
BUT WHAT ABOUT WHEN PEOPLE
ARE ACTUALLY BORN ON MARS ?

14:04.110 --> 14:05.702
THEIR MARS
ISN'T IN ANYTHING.

14:05.810 --> 14:09.530
BUT THEIR EARTH IT'S
IN VIRGO OR WHATEVER.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.244
HONEY,
NO ONE'S LISTENING.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.341
OH, I KNOW,
I'M EVEN BORING MYSELF.

14:13.450 --> 14:17.546
OH, LISA, I MADE SOME
PASTA SALAD WITHOUT
THE TUNA IN IT FOR YOU.

14:17.650 --> 14:18.878
NO, IT'S OKAY.

14:18.990 --> 14:20.412
I'M NURSING,
I NEED THE PROTEIN.

14:20.520 --> 14:22.112
SPENCER,
PUT THE KITTY DOWN !

14:22.220 --> 14:25.826
SO, THE WHOLE BREAST-FEEDING
IS GOING BETTER NOW ?

14:25.930 --> 14:27.795
YEAH, I'M TAKING
FENUGREEK.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.219
Fenugreek...

14:29.330 --> 14:30.888
OH, I'VE HEARD OF THAT,
HAVE I HEARD OF THAT ?

14:31.000 --> 14:33.833
IT'S AMAZING, NURSING WAS
SO PAINFUL FOR ME AT FIRST

14:33.940 --> 14:36.261
AND MY MILK PRODUCTION
SEEMED LIKE IT WOULD

14:36.370 --> 14:37.860
NEVER CATCH UP
WITH HER DEMAND...

14:37.970 --> 14:40.677
PUT THE KITTY DOWN !

14:40.780 --> 14:42.771
BUT NOW THERE'S
ALWAYS ENOUGH.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.246
THE ONLY DRAWBACK
IS MY SWEAT

14:45.350 --> 14:46.806
SMELLS A LITTLE
LIKE MAPLE SYRUP.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.172
THANK YOU !

14:49.280 --> 14:51.942
YOU KNOW, BREASTS ARE ACTUALLY
MODIFIED SWEAT GLANDS,

14:52.050 --> 14:54.211
AND I HARDLY
EVER SWEAT,

14:54.320 --> 14:56.208
WHICH IS MAYBE WHY IT WAS
SO PAINFUL FOR ME AT FIRST.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.880
I WISH I'D GOTTEN ONE
OF THOSE ELLIPTICAL ONES,

14:58.990 --> 15:01.424
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
BETTER FOR YOUR KNEES ?

15:01.530 --> 15:04.397
BUT I'M SURE I WOULDN'T
BE USING THAT ONE EITHER, SO.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.762
( laughing )

15:05.870 --> 15:07.735
HEY, TODD,
THANKS FOR HAVING US.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.569
YOU'RE TAKING OFF
SO SOON ?

15:09.670 --> 15:10.705
YEAH, I GOTTA
WORK TONIGHT.

15:10.810 --> 15:12.835
YOU WANT A HIT
FOR THE ROAD ?

15:12.940 --> 15:14.305
HMM ?

15:14.410 --> 15:15.900
NO, I BETTER NOT.

15:16.010 --> 15:17.147
ALRIGHT.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.342
HEY, I THINK
I MIGHT KNOW SOMEBODY

15:18.450 --> 15:20.008
WHO WANTS TO BUY
YOUR MOTORCYCLE.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.269
SOMEBODY ALREADY
BOUGHT IT.

15:21.380 --> 15:22.449
OH.

15:22.550 --> 15:23.619
OH, WELL.

15:27.420 --> 15:28.409
( laughing )

15:28.520 --> 15:31.728
ALRIGHT, THAN KS AGAIN,
I'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME.

15:31.830 --> 15:32.785
ALRIGHT, LATER.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.118
BYE.

15:38.330 --> 15:39.627
THAT W FUN.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.038
YEAH, I LIKE THEM.

15:41.140 --> 15:42.937
SHE'S NICE,
HE'S A LITTLE WEIRD.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.598
FOOD WAS GOOD.

15:44.710 --> 15:45.859
NATE.

15:45.970 --> 15:47.073
WHAT ?

15:47.180 --> 15:48.431
WE TOTALLY GRABBED
THE WRONG BAG.

15:48.540 --> 15:49.438
OH, SHIT.

15:49.540 --> 15:51.974
KEYS.
BE RIGHT BACK.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.719
I FEEL...

15:54.820 --> 15:56.071
JUDGED.

15:56.180 --> 15:59.911
I FEEL CRITICIZED.

16:00.020 --> 16:04.719
I FEEL LIKE NOTHING I DO
IS EVER GOOD ENOUGH.

16:04.830 --> 16:09.529
I FEEL ASHAMED
OF WHO I AM.

16:09.630 --> 16:13.168
I FEEL LIKE I'LL NEVER BE
THE PERSON YOU WANT ME TO BE.

16:13.270 --> 16:15.431
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE ANYONE
EXCEPT WHO YOU ARE.

16:15.540 --> 16:18.737
KEITH, NOW IS ABOUT
YOU LISTENING.

16:18.840 --> 16:21.001
YOU'LL GET YOUR CHANCE
IN A MOMENT.

16:21.110 --> 16:24.238
YEAH, OKAY.

16:28.320 --> 16:32.040
I FEEL LIKE I'M LIVING
IN A MINEFIELD SOMETIMES.

16:32.150 --> 16:34.186
YOUR ANGER IS
SO RANDOM AND ARBITRARY.

16:34.290 --> 16:36.679
LET'S TRY TO AVOID
MAKING JUDGMENTS

16:36.790 --> 16:38.985
ABOUT KEITH'S BEHAVIOR
RIGHT NOW,

16:39.090 --> 16:43.993
AND REALLY STAY FOCUSED
ON WHAT YOU FEEL.

16:44.100 --> 16:49.265
I'M AFRAID OF
PISSING YOU OFF, SO I...

16:49.370 --> 16:54.478
I'M CONSTANTLY
EDITING MYSELF.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.048
I GUESS I'M JUST
CONFUSED, LIKE...

17:00.150 --> 17:03.017
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO I AM ANYMORE.

17:07.790 --> 17:09.348
I'M DONE.

17:10.490 --> 17:11.684
NOW, KEITH.

17:11.790 --> 17:14.122
WHAT DID YOU HEAR ?

17:14.230 --> 17:15.891
A LOT OF WHINING.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.026
PERHAPS YOU HAVE
SOME FEELINGS OF YOUR OWN

17:19.130 --> 17:20.666
YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE ?

17:20.770 --> 17:21.839
YEAH, I HATE MY JOB.

17:21.940 --> 17:23.567
I FEEL LIKE
A FUCKING LOSER.

17:23.670 --> 17:25.103
DRIVING AROUND
IN A HOMEALERT UNIFORM,

17:25.210 --> 17:27.201
ANSWERING ALARMS
SET OFF BY POODLES,

17:27.310 --> 17:29.039
AND SUCKING UP
TO RICH ASSHOLES

17:29.140 --> 17:30.676
WHO MAKE MORE IN A DAY
THAN I MAKE IN A YEAR.

17:30.780 --> 17:33.874
I OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO BLOW OFF
SOME STEAM WHEN I COME HOME

17:33.980 --> 17:35.345
WITHOUT YOU ALWAYS
TAKING IT SO PERSONALLY.

17:35.450 --> 17:37.589
BECAUSE IT'S
VERY RARELY ABOUT YOU.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.749
DAVID ?

17:39.850 --> 17:41.283
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S FAIR.

17:41.390 --> 17:42.789
YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO HAVE ANY FEELINGS.

17:42.890 --> 17:46.781
NO, I'D JUST LIKE TO HAVE
A LITTLE FUN NOW AND THEN,

17:46.890 --> 17:48.096
LIKE WE USED TO.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.053
WE DON'T HAVE FUN ?

17:49.160 --> 17:50.388
RARELY.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.491
RARELY ?

17:52.600 --> 17:55.535
ON OCCASION.

17:57.670 --> 18:00.468
HOW'S YOUR SEX LIFE ?

18:03.880 --> 18:05.905
IT'S KINDA GREAT.

18:06.010 --> 18:07.409
YEAH, THAT PART WORKS.

18:07.520 --> 18:11.115
SO, IT SEEMS
ENGAGING PASSIONATELY

18:11.220 --> 18:14.815
IS COMFORTABLE IN THAT ARENA,
BUT NOT SO IN OTHER AREAS.

18:14.920 --> 18:18.287
WHAT OTHER THINGS DO THE TWO
OF YOU LIKE TO DO TOGETHER ?

18:18.390 --> 18:22.451
WE GO TO MOVIES
SOMETIMES.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.266
WE GO TO DINNER.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.292
WE USED TO PLAY
RACQUETBALL.

18:26.400 --> 18:29.494
HE WAS SO MUCH BETTER
THAN ME, IT WAS A JOKE.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.568
I WASN'T CHALLENGING
ENOUGH FOR HIM.

18:31.670 --> 18:32.739
I NEVER SAID THAT.

18:32.840 --> 18:34.137
IT MADE ME
FEEL INADEQUATE.

18:34.240 --> 18:37.209
WHAT KINDS OF THINGS
DO YOU DO ON YOUR OWN ?

18:37.310 --> 18:39.039
BESIDES WORK,
WORK OUT.

18:39.150 --> 18:40.640
YEAH.

18:40.750 --> 18:43.514
MY JOB KIND OF KEEPS ME
FROM DOING MUCH ELSE.

18:43.620 --> 18:46.316
FRIENDS ?

18:46.420 --> 18:49.856
MOST OF MY FRIENDS
WERE COPS,

18:49.960 --> 18:54.897
BUT I DON'T SEE THEM ANYMORE,
SINCE I LEFT THE FORCE.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.060
DAVID NEVER REALLY
HAD ANY CLOSE FRIENDS.

18:58.170 --> 18:59.523
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

18:59.630 --> 19:03.532
THERE'S A GROUP OF
INDEPENDENT FUNERAL DIRECTORS

19:03.640 --> 19:05.562
I GET TOGETHER WITH
EVERY MONTH.

19:05.670 --> 19:08.605
YOU HATE THOSE GUYS.

19:12.980 --> 19:15.369
WE'RE OUT OF TIME.

19:15.480 --> 19:18.483
THIS WEEK, SHOULD
ANY CONFLICTS ARISE,

19:18.590 --> 19:21.354
TRY TO FOCUS ON EXPRESSING
WHAT YOU'RE FEELING,

19:21.460 --> 19:23.280
INSTEAD OF CRITICIZING,
OR BLAMING,

19:23.390 --> 19:25.620
YEAH.
OKAY ?

19:29.130 --> 19:31.189
CHANGE.

20:00.760 --> 20:02.523
GOOD, RUSSELL.

20:02.630 --> 20:04.518
CHANGE.

20:19.580 --> 20:21.878
FUCK, IT'S ALMOST FIVE,
RICO'S GONNA HAVE MY HEAD.

20:21.980 --> 20:23.789
MOM.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.380
HELLO !

20:25.490 --> 20:27.879
HOW IS MY PRECIOUS GIRL
DOING TODAY ?

20:27.990 --> 20:29.878
SHE HAS
THE HICCUPS AGAIN.

20:29.990 --> 20:31.059
got the hiccups again.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.229
SHE GETS THAT
FROM HER DADDY.

20:32.330 --> 20:34.025
HE WAS A VERY GASSY BABY,
WASN'T HE ?

20:34.130 --> 20:35.154
YES, HE WAS !

20:35.260 --> 20:36.352
I'LL GET HER
SOME GRIPE WATER.

20:36.460 --> 20:38.360
DO YOU REMEMBER
TO BURP HER OFTEN, DEAR,

20:38.470 --> 20:39.562
WHEN SHE'S NURSING ?

20:39.670 --> 20:40.364
OF COURSE.

20:42.070 --> 20:43.708
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU ?

20:43.810 --> 20:47.871
I DON'T KNOW, I THINK I JUST
HAD THE WEIRDEST DEJA VU.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.629
HELLO !

20:49.740 --> 20:53.369
EVERY TIME I POP BY,
THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE HERE.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.539
HI, I'M CAROL WARD,
LISA'S BOSS.

20:55.650 --> 20:57.288
I'M RUTH FISHER,
NATE'S MOTHER.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.618
WE'VE MET
SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.278
YOU'RE NOT LIVING HERE
NOW TOO, ARE YOU ?

21:00.390 --> 21:02.517
I'M KIDDING.

21:02.620 --> 21:04.383
CALM DOWN.

21:04.490 --> 21:06.424
I HATE TO KEEP
HARPING ON THIS.

21:06.530 --> 21:07.690
I PARKED IN
THE DRIVEWAY AGAIN.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.222
WELL, THERE ARE
TWO CARS TODAY.

21:09.330 --> 21:10.627
I'M SORRY,
I DIDN'T KNOW--

21:10.730 --> 21:13.164
PLEASE, IT'S NO BIGGIE,
I'M SURE YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

21:13.270 --> 21:15.329
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE ?

21:15.440 --> 21:16.634
WELL, I WAS JUST
DROPPING OFF--

21:16.740 --> 21:18.765
I COULD GET A LITTLE
SIGN MADE UP, YOU KNOW ?

21:18.870 --> 21:21.930
"NATE, BACK IT UP,
PUT IT ON THE STREET."

21:22.040 --> 21:23.541
I'M KIDDING.

21:23.650 --> 21:26.346
LOOK, IF YOU WANT ME TO MOVE IT,
I'LL GO MOVE IT RIGHT NOW.

21:26.450 --> 21:28.042
DON'T BE SILLY,
WHENEVER, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

21:28.150 --> 21:30.380
SOONER RATHER
THAN LATER.

21:30.490 --> 21:34.381
OH, LISA, I'M HAVING DINNER
WITH PENNY MARSHALL TONIGHT,

21:34.490 --> 21:36.048
SO, I WON'T
NEED YOU TO COOK.

21:36.160 --> 21:37.457
OKAY.

21:37.560 --> 21:39.152
BUT I AM GOING TO HOST
AN IMPROMPTU GATHERING

21:39.260 --> 21:40.750
TOMORROW EVENING,

21:40.860 --> 21:42.350
JUST SOME CLOSE FRIENDS I WANT
TO TRY OUT A NEW PITCH ON.

21:42.460 --> 21:44.928
SHOULDN'T BE
MORE THAN... 30.

21:45.030 --> 21:47.191
OKAY.

21:47.300 --> 21:49.860
DO YOU HAVE TIME TO GO
OVER A MENU WITH ME ?

21:49.970 --> 21:50.902
NOW ?

21:51.010 --> 21:52.329
YES !

21:52.440 --> 21:54.169
TAKE YOUR TIME, DEAR,
I'VE GOT ALL AFTERNOON.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.100
NICE TO MEET YOU,
NATE'S MOTHER !

21:56.210 --> 21:58.405
SHE'S ENERGETIC.

21:58.510 --> 22:00.148
SHE'S A LUNATIC.

22:00.250 --> 22:02.047
( cell phone )

22:02.150 --> 22:04.243
HEY, RICO.

22:04.350 --> 22:06.739
NATE, HEY,
HOW'S IT GOING ?

22:06.850 --> 22:07.748
Good.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.555
GOOD, GOOD,
I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT.

22:09.660 --> 22:11.252
LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE AWARE OF THIS,

22:11.360 --> 22:12.657
OR IF YOU EVEN CARE,

22:12.760 --> 22:14.296
_We have two
VIewmgs tonight,

22:14.400 --> 22:16.288
one at 6:30
and one at 8:00 ?

22:16.400 --> 22:17.799
YEAH, I'M ON MY WAY.

22:17.900 --> 22:20.698
GOOD, BECAUSE YOUR BROTHER
IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND,

22:20.800 --> 22:23.507
YEAH, AND HE'S NOT
ANSWERING HIS CELL PHONE,

22:23.610 --> 22:25.862
AND THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH
I CAN DO, YOU KNOW ?

22:25.970 --> 22:27.005
Sure.

22:27.110 --> 22:29.135
I CAN'T BE AT TWO PLACES
AT THE SAME TIME, NATE !

22:29.240 --> 22:30.502
I GET IT, RICO, OKAY ?

22:30.610 --> 22:32.544
LAY OFF THE LECTURING,
I'M NOT YOUR KID.

22:32.650 --> 22:34.345
YEAH, WELL,
I'M NOT YOUR EMPLOYEE.

22:34.450 --> 22:36.179
I'M YOUR PARTNER.

22:36.280 --> 22:39.545
I AM A LICENSED
FUNERAL DIRECTOR NOW, OKAY ?

22:39.650 --> 22:43.256
You guys took my money,
you made me a partner.

22:43.360 --> 22:45.157
It's time you started
treating me like one.

22:45.260 --> 22:47.455
Goodbye.

22:59.140 --> 23:01.301
SO, CLAIRE,
HOW'S ART SCHOOL ?

23:01.410 --> 23:03.605
IT'S OKAY.

23:03.710 --> 23:05.405
WHAT KIND OF STUFF
ARE YOU DOING ?

23:05.510 --> 23:08.479
WELL, YESTERDAY
WE HAD TO DRAW

23:08.580 --> 23:10.480
THIS NAKED GUY
IN LIKE, 30 SECONDS.

23:10.590 --> 23:13.343
WELL, THAT SOUNDS FUN.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.109
NOT REALLY.

23:15.220 --> 23:16.619
IT'S HARD.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.483
AND, LIKE, I DON'T EVEN
WANT TO BE AN ILLUSTRATOR,

23:18.590 --> 23:19.818
OR PAINTER, OR WHATEVER.

23:19.930 --> 23:21.557
BUT THEY KEEP SAYING
THAT WE NEED TO KNOW

23:21.660 --> 23:23.355
HOW TO DO EVERYTHING,
LIKE PICASSO.

23:23.470 --> 23:24.721
IT'S INTENSE.

23:24.830 --> 23:25.899
YEAH, BUT...

23:26.000 --> 23:27.888
AT LEAST YOU GET TO BE
CREATIVE EVERY DAY.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.194
GOOD MORNING.

23:29.300 --> 23:30.460
HEY.

23:30.570 --> 23:31.764
HELLO, PUMPKIN !

23:31.870 --> 23:32.837
HOW'S IT GOING ?

23:32.940 --> 23:34.237
IT COULD NOT POSSIBLY
BE GOING ANY BETTER.

23:34.340 --> 23:36.228
WOULD YOU LOOK AT
THIS LITTLE GIRL ?

23:36.340 --> 23:38.547
IS THAT THE FACE
OF GOD, OR WHAT, HUH ?

23:38.650 --> 23:40.675
YEAH, THERE'S SOME STUFF
COMING OUT OF GOD'S NOSE.

23:40.780 --> 23:43.044
WHO'S PRECIOUS,
IS IT YOU ?

23:43.150 --> 23:44.185
YES, IT IS !

23:44.290 --> 23:45.689
MOM, CAN YOU HELP ME
WITH HER TODAY ?

23:45.790 --> 23:47.815
LISA'S GOTTA
HELP CAROL.

23:47.920 --> 23:49.353
CAROL'S HAVING THIS BIG
HOLLYWOOD ASSLICK DINNER,

23:49.460 --> 23:50.381
AND LISA'S GOTTA SHOP.

23:50.490 --> 23:51.821
OF COURSE.

23:51.930 --> 23:56.355
YOU GUYS, SHE TOOK THE MOST
AMAZING POOP THIS MORNING.

23:56.460 --> 23:57.927
WHO, LISA ?

23:58.030 --> 24:01.193
SERIOUSLY, IT WAS
SO PERFECT LY FORMED,

24:01.300 --> 24:03.507
SO, HEALTHY
AND COMPACT.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.430
IT WAS LIKE
A REGULAR ADULT POOP,

24:05.540 --> 24:06.700
IT MADE ME SO HAPPY.

24:06.810 --> 24:08.038
I SWEAR, WHEN YOU
LIVE WITH A BABY,

24:08.140 --> 24:10.074
YOU GET TO SEE THE WORLD
AS BEING TOTALLY NEW

24:10.180 --> 24:11.306
ALL OVER AGAIN.

24:11.410 --> 24:12.638
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE SO PURE
AND UNCORRUPTED,

24:12.750 --> 24:13.978
IT'S A FUCKING PRIVILEGE.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.672
AND HOW COME
NEITHER OF YOU

24:15.780 --> 24:16.747
HAS BEEN OVER
TO VISIT HER RECENTLY ?

24:16.850 --> 24:18.488
BECAUSE BEING
A FATHER

24:18.590 --> 24:21.081
HAS TURNED YOU
INTO A DITHERING IDIOT.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.923
WOW.

24:24.030 --> 24:26.555
YOU'RE SO TOUGH AND COOL
AND ABOVE IT ALL.

24:26.660 --> 24:27.797
I WISH I WAS YOU.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.390
DOES ANYBODY WANT
THE END PIECE ?

24:29.500 --> 24:32.469
want the end piece ?

24:32.570 --> 24:34.197
OH, NATE, CAN YOU
DROP MRS. FOLGER

24:34.300 --> 24:35.437
AT THE CREMATORY
THIS AFTERNOON ?

24:35.540 --> 24:38.862
NO, I'VE GOT
THE PAULK FUNERAL.

24:38.970 --> 24:41.530
YEAH, WELL, I'VE GOT
THE BENNETT FUNERAL.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.744
CAN'T RICO DO IT ?

24:43.850 --> 24:46.546
I BELIEVE HIS EXACT WORDS
WERE, "NO FUCKING WAY,

24:46.650 --> 24:48.743
I'M NOT YOUR FUCKING
GOPHER ANYMORE."

24:48.850 --> 24:52.115
CLAIRE, CAN YOU
GIVE US A HAND ?

24:55.790 --> 24:57.724
SORRY,
I HAVE HOMEWORK.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.628
WE'LL PAY YOU 50 BUCKS.

25:00.730 --> 25:04.222
WE'D PAY A DELIVERY
SERVICE MORE THAN THAT.

25:04.330 --> 25:07.094
ALRIGHT.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.760
AS LONG AS I DON'T HAVE
TO TOUCH ANY DEAD SKIN.

25:09.870 --> 25:11.531
NO, SHE'S ALL
BOXED UP.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.779
AND I CAN'T DO IT
'TIL AROUND FOUR,

25:13.880 --> 25:16.178
'CAUSE I HAVE TO PRACTICE
DRAWING A PERFECT CIRCLE.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.407
THAT TAKES
SEVEN HOURS ?

25:18.510 --> 25:20.444
I HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO DO IT ON COMMAND

25:20.550 --> 25:21.869
IN CLASS TOMORROW, OKAY ?

25:21.980 --> 25:23.948
IT'S NOT AS EASY
AS IT SOUNDS.

25:28.420 --> 25:34.097
* WAITING FOR HIM
TO SHOW YOU *

25:34.200 --> 25:50.743
* HOW HE'S GONNA GIVE HIMSELF
COMPLETELY AWAY TO YOU *

25:50.850 --> 26:04.457
* 'CAUSE THIS TIME AROUND
HE SAYS HE WILL EXCEL *

26:04.560 --> 26:11.864
* AND THE BAD DAY...

26:19.410 --> 26:20.809
EW.

26:20.910 --> 26:23.743
IS THAT THE BOX THAT NEEDS
TO GO TO THE CREMATORY ?

26:23.850 --> 26:25.977
TH E--

26:26.080 --> 26:28.776
AH, YEAH.

26:28.880 --> 26:32.839
WELL, I CAN
TAKE IT NOW.

26:37.390 --> 26:39.779
YOU'RE TAKING IT ?

26:39.890 --> 26:41.926
YEAH, THEY HIRED ME
TO DO RUNS,

26:42.030 --> 26:43.918
SINCE NOBODY ELSE
WANTS TO DO IT.

26:44.030 --> 26:45.566
REALLY.

26:45.670 --> 26:47.729
YEAH, FOR
50 BUCKS A SHOT.

26:47.840 --> 26:52.265
BUT YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO HELP ME GET THAT INTO MY CAR.

26:57.140 --> 26:59.074
SO, WHAT KIND OF MUSIC
DO YOU GUYS PLAY ?

26:59.180 --> 27:00.579
I DON'T KNOW.

27:00.680 --> 27:03.217
IT'S KINDA LIKE EARLY
PETER GABRIEL MEETS TOOL ?

27:03.320 --> 27:07.814
EMOTIONALLY VULNERABLE,
LIKE SUNNY DAY REAL ESTATE,

27:07.920 --> 27:12.186
BUT POLITICALLY CONSCIOUS,
LIKE PUBLIC ENEMY ?

27:12.290 --> 27:15.726
WE'RE STILL
WORKING IT OUT.

27:15.830 --> 27:19.197
WHEN YOU GUYS PLAY, YOU SHOULD
LET ME KNOW, I'LL COME.

27:19.300 --> 27:21.495
WHY DON'T YOU HANG OUT
WHILE WE PRACTICE ?

27:21.600 --> 27:25.366
OH, I DON'T
THINK I CAN.

27:29.840 --> 27:32.308
I'VE GOT THIS THING
I'M SUPPOSED TO...

27:32.410 --> 27:35.379
OKAY.

27:36.520 --> 27:37.475
I'M PHIL.

27:37.580 --> 27:38.649
I'M CLAIRE.

27:38.750 --> 27:40.081
YOU WANT A BEER ?

27:40.190 --> 27:41.384
SURE.

27:47.590 --> 27:49.399
YOU REALLY
AMAZE ME, LISA.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.559
WHY ?

27:51.670 --> 27:54.366
YOUR ENERGY,
IT'S BOUNDLESS.

27:54.470 --> 27:56.893
YOU SHOULD BE BOTTLED AS
AN ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCE,

27:57.000 --> 27:58.831
YOU WOULD SAVE THE WORLD,
I'M SERIOUS.

27:58.940 --> 28:01.932
WELL, THAT'S KINDA FUNNY,

28:02.040 --> 28:05.942
BECAUSE I FEEL
TIRED ALL THE TIME.

28:06.050 --> 28:07.506
REALLY ?

28:07.610 --> 28:09.009
YEAH.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.543
I THINK IT JUST COMES
WITH BEING A MOM, YOU KNOW ?

28:11.650 --> 28:14.210
YEAH.

28:14.320 --> 28:16.254
NOT THAT
I'M COMPLAINING.

28:16.360 --> 28:20.524
I MEAN, MAYAAS TOTALLY
TRANSFORMED MY LIFE,

28:20.630 --> 28:24.191
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE GOING BACK
TO THE WAY THINGS WERE BEFORE.

28:24.300 --> 28:26.689
WOW.

28:26.800 --> 28:28.597
I MEAN SO WHAT,
IF I HAVE TO WORK EXTRA HARD ?

28:28.700 --> 28:30.133
I WANT TO.

28:30.240 --> 28:35.837
IT'S WORTH IT,
IT IS SO WORTH IT.

28:37.110 --> 28:41.843
( sobbing )

28:46.690 --> 28:48.089
CAROL ?

28:48.190 --> 28:48.986
UGH !

28:49.090 --> 28:50.580
NO, DON'T PAY
ANY ATTENTION TO ME.

28:50.690 --> 28:52.749
I'M JUST NERVOUS...

28:52.860 --> 28:55.226
NERVOUS ABOUT THIS
MEETING NEXT WEEK.

28:55.330 --> 28:57.890
I HAVE TO PITCH
TO MCG IN PERSON.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.423
WHOA, IS HE
INTIMIDATING.

29:07.540 --> 29:10.031
CAN I MAKE YOU
SOME CHAMOMILE TEA ?

29:10.140 --> 29:11.801
FOR CHRISSAKE, I'M NOT
YOUR GRANDMOTHER, OKAY ?

29:11.910 --> 29:13.446
I'M YOUR BOSS.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.511
( sobbing )

29:24.690 --> 29:27.898
STOP LOOKING
AT ME, LISA !

29:32.030 --> 29:34.396
CAROL, I'M ALWAYS
HERE FOR YOU--

29:34.500 --> 29:35.637
AH!

29:35.740 --> 29:38.834
ALSO, I SWIM LAPS
IN THE MORNING,

29:38.940 --> 29:41.079
AND I USED TO BE ABLE
TO DO THAT NAKED,

29:41.180 --> 29:43.740
WHICH WAS A GREAT WAY
TO START THE DAY,

29:43.850 --> 29:45.203
LIKE I WAS ARTEMIS.

29:45.310 --> 29:47.642
I WOULD GO OUT THERE
FEELING LIKE A WARRIOR,

29:47.750 --> 29:49.445
LIKE A HUNTRESS, WHICH IS
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO

29:49.550 --> 29:50.881
WHEN YOU'RE
IN MY BUSINESS.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.184
BUT NOW I CAN'T
DO THAT ANYMORE,

29:52.290 --> 29:54.019
BECAUSE THERE'S
A MAN LIVING HERE !

29:54.120 --> 29:56.714
I'M SURE NATE
WOULDN'T MIND--

29:56.820 --> 29:58.082
I WOULD !

29:58.190 --> 30:01.751
ALSO, I DON'T APPRECIATE
THE HOSTILITY HE SHOWS

30:01.860 --> 30:04.067
BY ALWAYS PARKING
IN THE DRIVEWAY !

30:04.170 --> 30:07.765
I'M SORRY, I WILL
TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT--

30:07.870 --> 30:08.996
YEAH.

30:09.100 --> 30:11.432
I'M GONNA GO SWIM
SOME LAPS.

30:18.310 --> 30:19.743
ARE YOU READY
FOR THE BOK CHOI ?

30:19.850 --> 30:21.215
YEAH.

30:27.920 --> 30:29.182
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

30:29.290 --> 30:30.052
ADDING PEPPER.

30:30.160 --> 30:31.354
I ALREADY
ADDED PEPPER.

30:31.460 --> 30:34.349
OH.

30:38.630 --> 30:40.120
OKAY, I FEEL SHAMED.

30:40.230 --> 30:41.299
WHAT ?

30:41.400 --> 30:43.197
WHEN YOU SAID
"I ALREADY ADDED PEPPER,"

30:43.300 --> 30:45.530
MY PERCEPTION WAS THAT
YOU WERE IRRITATED WITH ME

30:45.640 --> 30:46.959
FOR NOT KNOWING
THAT ALREADY,

30:47.070 --> 30:48.799
AND THAT YOU WERE
ALSO ANGRY WITH ME,

30:48.910 --> 30:50.571
THAT I SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE IT.

30:50.680 --> 30:52.341
WHY WOULD I BE
ANGRY WITH YOU ?

30:52.450 --> 30:53.701
I DON'T KNOW.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.539
MAYBE YOU DON'T WANT ME TO BE
INVOLVED IN THE COOKING PROCESS,

30:55.650 --> 30:57.174
MAYBE YOU
JUST WANT ME

30:57.280 --> 30:59.487
TO PREPARE
THE INGREDIENTS FOR YOU ?

30:59.590 --> 31:00.841
MAYBE YOU WANT
TOTAL CONTROL

31:00.960 --> 31:02.109
OVER WHAT ACTUALLY
HAPPENS INSIDE THE WOK.

31:02.220 --> 31:04.324
SO, WE HAVE A LITTLE
EXTRA PEPPER IN THE WOK.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.057
IT'S NOT
A BIG DEAL.

31:06.160 --> 31:09.391
I KNOW IT'S NOT
A BIG DEAL.

31:13.940 --> 31:16.329
OKAY.

31:16.440 --> 31:17.930
I HEARD
WHAT YOU SAID.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.508
IT WAS NOT MY INTENTION
TO SHAME YOU.

31:20.610 --> 31:22.601
I KNOW.

31:22.710 --> 31:26.669
GOOD, I LOVE YOU.

31:26.780 --> 31:28.418
ARE THE CARROTS READY ?

31:28.520 --> 31:30.169
YEAH.

31:33.990 --> 31:35.457
YOU KNOW, I GREW UP
IN A FAMILY

31:35.560 --> 31:37.687
WHERE PEOPLE EXPRESSED
THEIR ANGER ON A REGULAR BASIS,

31:37.790 --> 31:39.621
SO, THAT'S WHAT INTIMACY
FEELS LIKE TO ME.

31:39.730 --> 31:42.153
BUT YOU GREW UP
IN A FAMILY

31:42.260 --> 31:43.898
WHERE NO ONE EVER
EXPRESSED ANYTHING.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.160
YEAH, WE ALSO NEVER
HIT EACH OTHER.

31:45.270 --> 31:48.660
SO, WHENEVER
I'M SLIGHTLY IRRITATED,

31:48.770 --> 31:49.794
IT SCARES YOU, RIGHT ?

31:49.900 --> 31:51.936
RIGHT.

31:56.280 --> 31:59.147
IT JUST MEANS
I'M COMFORTABLE WITH YOU.

32:00.480 --> 32:03.210
IT DOESN'T MEAN
I DON'T LOVE YOU.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.752
DID YOU PICK UP
THE DRY CLEANING TODAY ?

32:10.860 --> 32:13.283
YEAH, IT'S
IN THE CLOSET.

32:24.870 --> 32:27.805
* NOW I KNOW IT'S NOT

32:27.910 --> 32:32.279
* NO, IT'S NOT...

32:39.620 --> 32:42.589
* IT'S NOT...

32:45.690 --> 32:48.488
THERE, ISN'T
THAT DELICIOUS ?

32:48.600 --> 32:52.024
YOUR DADDY, HE USED
TO LOVE PEANUT BUTTER TOO.

32:52.130 --> 32:53.461
YES, HE DID.

32:53.570 --> 32:54.639
SO DID
YOUR UNCLE DAVID.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.731
NOT YOUR AUNT CLAIRE,
THOUGH.

32:56.840 --> 32:58.535
SHE ABSOLUTELY
HATED IT.

32:58.640 --> 33:01.234
ALWAYS DID,
STILL DOES.

33:02.710 --> 33:04.849
ISN'T IT FUNNY ?

33:04.950 --> 33:07.077
THEY WERE ALL LITTLE
BABIES ONCE TOO.

33:07.180 --> 33:11.014
BUT THEIR DADDY'S MOMMY NEVER
LIKED SPENDING TIME WITH THEM

33:11.120 --> 33:13.179
THE WAY I LIKE
SPENDING TIME WITH YOU.

33:13.290 --> 33:17.715
SHE NEVER REALLY LIKED ME,
AND SHE NEVER LIKED MY CHILDREN.

33:17.820 --> 33:21.199
SHE WAS CONVINCED I HAD
GOTTEN PREGNANT ON PURPOSE,

33:21.300 --> 33:23.723
TO TRAP NATHANIEL
INTO MARRYING ME,

33:23.830 --> 33:25.969
WHICH WASN'T
TRUE AT ALL.

33:26.070 --> 33:28.061
I CERTAINLY NEVER
INTENDED FOR THAT HAPPEN,

33:28.170 --> 33:32.061
ESPECIALLY WHEN
I WAS SO YOUNG.

33:33.270 --> 33:36.068
AND I WAS TERRIFIED
WHEN YOUR DADDY WAS BORN.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.705
ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED.

33:41.010 --> 33:43.319
( cooing )

33:47.820 --> 33:49.856
HEY, MOM.

33:49.960 --> 33:51.780
GOODNESS,
YOU STARTLED ME.

33:51.890 --> 33:53.221
SHE GIVE YOU
ANY TROUBLE ?

33:53.330 --> 33:55.093
HEAVENS, NO,
SHE'S AN ANGEL.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.657
WHAT DO YOU SAY, YOU READY
TO GO HOME, ANGEL ?

33:57.760 --> 33:58.829
HAVE YOU EATEN ?

33:58.930 --> 34:00.067
I MADE YOU
A CHICKEN BREAST.

34:00.170 --> 34:01.990
NO THANKS, I GOTTA
BE GETTING HOME.

34:02.100 --> 34:05.968
BUT PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE,
I'LL EAT IT TOMORROW.

34:06.070 --> 34:08.209
YOU KNOW, IF YOU AND LISA
WOULD LIKE A NIGHT OFF,

34:08.310 --> 34:09.834
I'D BE HAPPY
TO WATCH HER.

34:09.940 --> 34:11.373
YOU COULD GO OUT
TO EAT, SEE A MOVIE.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.141
I COULD EVEN KEEP
HER HERE OVERNIGHT.

34:13.250 --> 34:15.218
THANKS, MOM,
BUT LISA'S WORKING TONIGHT.

34:15.320 --> 34:18.084
PLUS, MAYA HASN'T SLEPT OUTSIDE
OF THE FAMILY BED YET, SO.

34:18.190 --> 34:20.715
WELL, MAYBE IT MIGHT
BE BETTER FOR HER

34:20.820 --> 34:23.459
TO TRY A NIGHT
SLEEPING ON HER OWN.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.687
MOM, WE KNOW HOW
YOU FEEL ABOUT IT,

34:25.790 --> 34:27.849
YOU'RE VERY
CLEAR IN THAT.

34:27.960 --> 34:29.291
BUT WE FEEL
DIFFERENTLY, OKAY ?

34:29.400 --> 34:30.890
SHE'S ALMOST
NINE MONTHS OLD,

34:31.000 --> 34:33.298
SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE
THE "FAMILY BED" SOME TIME.

34:33.400 --> 34:38.406
WELL, MAYA WILL LET US KNOW
WHEN SHE'S READY TO LEAVE,

34:38.510 --> 34:39.499
ALRIGHT.

34:39.610 --> 34:41.237
GOODNIGHT.

34:43.740 --> 34:45.378
GOODNIGHT, GRANDMA.

34:45.480 --> 34:46.845
GOODNIGHT.

34:59.130 --> 35:00.620
ARE WE HAVING SEX ?

35:00.730 --> 35:05.167
UH, OKAY.

35:05.270 --> 35:09.263
JUST LET ME TAKE
A SHOWER FIRST.

35:11.870 --> 35:15.431
( humming )

35:30.920 --> 35:34.720
( gargling )

36:37.660 --> 36:39.878
MORNING.

36:42.730 --> 36:45.767
WHAT TIME IS IT ?

36:45.870 --> 36:48.236
A LITTLE BEFORE 10,
I THINK.

36:48.340 --> 36:50.729
HOW DO YOU TAKE IT ?

36:50.840 --> 36:54.708
BLACK.

37:01.210 --> 37:02.643
HEY.

37:02.750 --> 37:04.581
HEY.

37:04.690 --> 37:06.214
SO, WHAT DO YOU
HAVE TO DO TODAY ?

37:06.320 --> 37:10.108
AH, CLASS.

37:10.220 --> 37:12.085
WHAT KIND OF CLASS ?

37:12.190 --> 37:14.124
DRAWING CLASS.

37:14.230 --> 37:17.097
WE'RE LEARNING HOW
TO DRAW A PERFECT CIRCLE.

37:17.200 --> 37:19.589
THAT SOUNDS
KINDA COOL.

37:19.700 --> 37:23.363
IT'S NOT, IT'S STUPID
AND TEDIOUS AND POINTLESS.

37:23.470 --> 37:24.937
I WENT TO ART SCHOOL
TO BE EXPRESSIVE,

37:25.040 --> 37:27.736
NOT TO PERFORM SOME POINTLESS
TASK LIKE SOME LAB RAT.

37:27.840 --> 37:31.469
YOU WANNA PLAY HOOKY ?

37:36.020 --> 37:38.011
YES.

37:39.750 --> 37:41.809
NATE, I NEED YOU
TO DO ME A BIG FAVOR

37:41.920 --> 37:44.013
AND COVER THE FOLGER FUNERAL
FOR ME THIS AFTERNOON.

37:44.120 --> 37:46.725
HEY, WHO'S FRANK MUEHLER ?

37:47.730 --> 37:49.049
FRANK, WHO ?

37:49.160 --> 37:51.390
MEUHLER, HE'S IN THE DATE BOOK
HERE EVERY WEDNESDAY AT TWO.

37:51.500 --> 37:53.127
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO IDEA.

37:53.230 --> 37:54.731
MUST BE SOMEBODY
RICO PUT IN THERE.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.535
HUH.

37:56.640 --> 38:00.167
THERE'S A PHONE NUMBER,
I'M GONNA CALL AND FIND OUT.

38:00.270 --> 38:01.737
ALRIGHT, NO.

38:01.840 --> 38:07.107
KEITH AND I ARE
IN COUPLES COUNSELING.

38:07.210 --> 38:09.144
REALLY.

38:09.250 --> 38:10.808
IT'S NOT THAT
BIG A DEAL.

38:10.920 --> 38:12.285
ARE YOU GUYS OKAY ?

38:12.390 --> 38:13.982
YEAH, OF COURSE
WE'RE OKAY.

38:14.090 --> 38:15.785
WE'RE JUST SEEKING THE ADVICE
OF A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL

38:15.890 --> 38:17.778
TO HELP US TO ESTABLISH
APPROPRIATE BOUNDARIES

38:17.890 --> 38:20.051
AND WRITE THE RULES OF
OUR RELATIONSHIP TOGETHER.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.390
WHAT HAPPENED ?

38:22.500 --> 38:24.024
NOTHING HAPPENED.

38:24.130 --> 38:26.291
KEITH HAS A LOT
OF ANGER ISSUES

38:26.400 --> 38:27.822
THAT HE INHERITED
FROM HIS FATHER

38:27.930 --> 38:30.296
AND I HAVE A LOT OF DOORMAT
ISSUES I INHERITED FROM MOM.

38:30.400 --> 38:33.403
CAN WE PLEASE NEVER
TALK ABOUT THIS AGAIN ?

38:33.510 --> 38:36.331
SURE, YOU'RE OKAY
THOUGH, RIGHT ?

38:36.440 --> 38:38.305
CAN WE PLEASE NEVER
TALK ABOUT THIS AGAIN ?

38:38.410 --> 38:39.672
GOT IT.

38:54.090 --> 38:56.024
AND HOW ARE YOU
AND LISA ?

38:56.130 --> 39:00.590
AH, WE'RE GREAT.

39:00.700 --> 39:03.863
IT'S STILL A LITTLE
BIZARRE TO ME.

39:03.970 --> 39:09.101
OF ALL THE POSSIBLE WAYS MY LIFE
COULD HAVE GONE, YOU KNOW ?

39:09.210 --> 39:11.906
YEAH.

39:12.010 --> 39:16.845
YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S JUST ABOUT
A YEAR AGO I GOT ENGAGED.

39:16.950 --> 39:19.282
REMEMBER THAT ?

39:19.390 --> 39:23.349
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
I LOVED BRENDA.

39:23.460 --> 39:26.520
OR MAYBE I THOUGHT
I COULD JUST MAKE IT WORK

39:26.630 --> 39:30.828
JUST OUT OF
SHEER WILL, BUT...

39:30.930 --> 39:35.799
YOU JUST NEVER KNOW.

39:35.900 --> 39:39.859
YOU HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA
WHAT LIFE HAS IN STORE FOR YOU.

39:47.150 --> 39:50.313
SO, CAN YOU COVER
THE FOLGER FUNERAL
FOR ME OR NOT ?

39:50.420 --> 39:53.787
WHAT IS IT, YOU JUST
NEED SOME TIME OFF ?

39:53.890 --> 39:55.118
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE ALRIGHT ?

39:55.220 --> 39:56.312
I'M FINE.

39:56.420 --> 39:59.548
I'VE GOT AN AUDITION

39:59.660 --> 40:01.651
FOR THE GAY MEN'S CHORUS
OF LOS ANGELES.

40:01.760 --> 40:04.797
WHAT ?

40:04.900 --> 40:06.162
THAT SOUNDS FUN.

40:06.270 --> 40:09.068
I'M TRYING TO CREATE SOMETHING
FOR MYSELF OUTSIDE OF MY JOB

40:09.170 --> 40:10.398
AND MY RELATIONSHIP.

40:10.500 --> 40:13.060
I COULD REALLY USE
YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS.

40:13.170 --> 40:16.207
ALRIGHT, DON'T WORRY, THE FOLGER
THING'S A WALK IN THE PARK.

40:16.310 --> 40:17.868
YOU JUST GO
KNOCK 'EM DEAD.

40:17.980 --> 40:19.868
NO PUN INTENDED.

40:19.980 --> 40:21.208
I'M SO NERVOUS.

40:21.310 --> 40:22.277
DAVID...

40:22.380 --> 40:24.268
YOU'LL BE GREAT.

40:24.380 --> 40:25.881
FROM YOUR MOUTH
TO GOD'S EARS.

40:25.990 --> 40:27.617
RIGHT.

40:28.860 --> 40:30.179
THAN KS, NATE.

40:30.290 --> 40:31.951
ANY TIME.

40:47.610 --> 40:51.979
( phone ringing )

40:54.920 --> 40:56.148
HELLO ?

40:56.250 --> 40:57.171
Hi, it's Lisa.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.349
OH, HELLO.

40:58.450 --> 41:00.247
Ruth, did you give
Maya peanut butter ?

41:00.350 --> 41:01.578
YES, AND SHE
JUST LOVED IT.

41:01.690 --> 41:04.659
RUTH, YOU NEVER GIVE
BABIES PEANUT BUTTER

41:04.760 --> 41:06.182
UNDER THE AGE OF ONE,

41:06.290 --> 41:07.552
THEY CAN DEVELOP
HORRIBLE ALLERGIES.

41:07.660 --> 41:08.820
Didn't you know that ?

41:08.930 --> 41:12.366
NO, I DIDN'T,
IS SHE ALRIGHT ?

41:12.470 --> 41:13.960
Yes, but that's
not the point.

41:14.070 --> 41:15.560
YOU SHOULD NEVER
GIVE HER PEANUT BUTTER.

41:15.670 --> 41:19.367
OR HONEY, OR STRAWBERRIES,
OR EGG WHITES.

41:19.470 --> 41:20.767
Please.

41:20.870 --> 41:22.007
OF COURSE.

41:22.110 --> 41:25.147
I'M SORRY TO BE SO ABRUPT
WITH YOU, I JUST--

41:25.250 --> 41:27.343
No, I'm sorry,
I had no idea.

41:27.450 --> 41:29.645
PEANUT BUTTER
WAS NEVER A PROBLEM

41:29.750 --> 41:31.308
WHEN MY CHILDREN
WERE YOUNG.

41:31.420 --> 41:33.980
ARE YOU SURE
SHE'S ALRIGHT ?

41:34.090 --> 41:35.182
SHE'S FINE.

41:35.290 --> 41:37.611
Do you need any help
with her today ?

41:37.720 --> 41:38.982
I could come over.

41:39.090 --> 41:41.320
RUTH, NO.

41:41.430 --> 41:42.920
YOU SPEND SO MUCH TIME
OVER HERE, I FEEL BAD.

41:43.030 --> 41:45.794
IT'S NO PROBLEM
AT ALL, I LIKE--

41:45.900 --> 41:47.458
Seriously, take some time
for yourself.

41:47.570 --> 41:49.663
I HARDLY SAW MAYA
AT ALL YESTERDAY,

41:49.770 --> 41:52.432
I REALLY JUST WANTED IT
TO BE THE TWO OF US TODAY.

41:52.540 --> 41:54.201
OKAY.

41:54.310 --> 41:56.972
But thanks,
I'll talk to you later.

42:17.330 --> 42:18.820
THANK GOD.

42:18.930 --> 42:22.798
IT'S VERY FRIGHTENING,
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO TO CALL.

42:22.900 --> 42:25.004
MA'AM, JUST CALM DOWN,
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED, OKAY ?

42:25.110 --> 42:27.761
COME, I'LL SHOW YOU.

42:33.880 --> 42:39.182
* WHERE HAS THE TIME
ALL GONE TO *

42:39.290 --> 42:44.626
* HAVEN'T DONE HALF
THE THINGS WE WANT TO *

42:44.730 --> 42:51.966
* OH WELL, WE'LL CATCH UP
SOME OTHER TIME *

42:54.400 --> 42:58.461
* THIS DAY WAS
JUST A TOKEN *

42:58.570 --> 43:04.133
* TOO MANY WORDS
ARE STILL UNSPOKEN *

43:04.240 --> 43:11.646
* OH WELL, WE'LL CATCH UP
SOME OTHER TIME *

43:13.890 --> 43:18.418
* JUST WHEN THE FUN
IS STARTING *

43:18.520 --> 43:23.457
* COMES THE TIME
FOR PARTING *

43:23.560 --> 43:28.168
* BUT LET'S BE GLAD
FOR WHAT WE'VE HAD *

43:28.270 --> 43:33.902
* AND WHAT'S TO COME

43:35.510 --> 43:39.002
* THERE'S SO MUCH
MORE EMBRACING *

43:39.110 --> 43:46.141
* STILL TO BE DONE,
BUT TIME IS RACING *

43:46.250 --> 43:54.692
* OH WELL, WE'LL CATCH UP
SOME OTHER TIME *

44:01.200 --> 44:03.566
IT'S JUST ALWAYS WEIRD WHEN
YOU FIND STUFF LIKE THAT OUT,

44:03.670 --> 44:04.967
YOU KNOW, LATER ON
IN YOUR LIFE.

44:05.070 --> 44:07.937
I MEAN, I HAD NO IDEA
THAT I WASN'T PLANNED.

44:08.040 --> 44:11.806
I'M NOT SURE WHAT
DIFFERENCE IT MAKES.

44:11.910 --> 44:14.640
I MEAN, MAYA WASN'T
PLANNED EITHER,

44:14.750 --> 44:16.308
AND WE COULDN'T LOVE HER
ANYMORE THAN WE DO.

44:16.420 --> 44:17.819
YEAH.

44:21.320 --> 44:22.856
IT'S JUST...

44:24.860 --> 44:27.283
I DON'T KNOW.

44:28.460 --> 44:29.927
WHAT ?

44:33.100 --> 44:35.398
I DON'T LIKE KNOWING THAT MY
WHOLE EXISTENCE IS AN ACCIDENT.

44:35.500 --> 44:38.628
IT'S JUST
TOO FUCKING...

44:38.740 --> 44:40.537
RAN DOM.

44:40.640 --> 44:44.201
YEAH, BUT THAT'S
THE WAY IT HAPPENED.

44:44.310 --> 44:48.918
THINGS HAPPEN THE WAY
THEY'RE MEANT TO, NATE.

44:51.250 --> 44:53.184
SEE, THERE'S A KIND
OF FATALISM IN THAT

44:53.290 --> 44:54.518
THAT I JUST DON'T BUY.

44:54.620 --> 45:00.820
WELL, WHAT'S
THE ALTERNATIVE ?

45:06.800 --> 45:09.360
WE MAKE CHOICES.

45:09.470 --> 45:13.133
YEAH, BUT MAYBE YOUR PARENTS
NEVER WOULD HAVE CHOSEN

45:13.240 --> 45:15.174
TO GET MARRIED
IF YOU HADN'T HAPPENED,

45:15.280 --> 45:17.475
AND THEN NOT ONLY
WOULD YOU NOT EXIST,

45:17.580 --> 45:19.138
BUT CLAIRE AND DAVID
WOULDN'T EITHER.

45:19.250 --> 45:21.946
IT'S JUST NOT WHAT
WAS MEANT TO HAPPEN.

45:22.050 --> 45:25.542
BUT SURELY
WE'RE MORE THAN JUST...

45:25.650 --> 45:27.845
THINGS THAT HAPPEN.

45:27.950 --> 45:30.953
MAYBE WE ARE,
MAYBE WE'RE NOT.

45:34.530 --> 45:36.452
I LOVE IT WHEN
SHE DOES THAT.

45:36.560 --> 45:37.697
when she does that.

45:37.800 --> 45:38.824
WHEN SHE SORT OF JERKS,
YOU KNOW ?

45:38.930 --> 45:40.295
sort of jerks,
you know ?

45:40.400 --> 45:41.264
RIGHT BEFORE SHE...

45:41.370 --> 45:42.689
FALLS OFF TO SLEEP.

45:42.800 --> 45:46.361
WAKES HERSELF UP.

45:46.470 --> 45:48.700
YOU FREAKED OUT THE FIRST TIME
SHE EVER DID IT.

45:48.810 --> 45:52.439
I REMEMBER THAT
FEELING OF FALLING--

45:52.550 --> 45:53.278
falling.

45:53.380 --> 45:54.870
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

45:54.980 --> 45:57.869
LIKE I WAS FALLING OUT OF BED,
AND IT ALWAYS WOKE ME UP.

45:57.980 --> 46:00.540
LIKE I WAS
SCARED OF WHAT--

46:00.650 --> 46:02.083
WHAT YOU WERE GOING
TO FALL INTO ?

46:02.190 --> 46:03.919
YEAH.

46:04.020 --> 46:08.229
BUT THAT NEVER
HAPPENS TO ME ANYMORE.

46:10.900 --> 46:12.595
DOT BE
SO SURE OF THAT.

46:12.700 --> 46:15.965
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU ?

46:16.070 --> 46:18.561
I THINK
I DREAMED THIS.

46:18.670 --> 46:20.433
WHAT ?

46:23.740 --> 46:25.799
THIS MOMENT, THIS.

46:25.910 --> 46:28.140
THIS LIFE
WE HAVE TOGETHER.

46:28.250 --> 46:30.514
YOU AND ME, MAYA.

46:31.480 --> 46:33.619
HERE.

46:33.720 --> 46:36.086
NOW.

46:39.630 --> 46:43.088
* HONEY

46:43.200 --> 46:48.194
* ALL THE MOVEMENTS
YOU'RE STARTING TO MAKE *

46:48.300 --> 46:55.172
* SEE ME CRUMBLE
AND FALL ON MY FACE *

46:55.280 --> 47:02.174
* AND I KNOW THE MISTAKES
THAT I MADE *

47:02.280 --> 47:09.652
* SEE IT ALL DISAPPEAR
WITHOUT A TRACE *

47:09.760 --> 47:16.051
* AND THEY CALL
AS THEY BECKON YOU ON *

47:16.160 --> 47:23.191
* THEY SAID START
AS YOU MEAN TO GO ON *

47:23.300 --> 47:30.229
* START AS YOU MEAN
TO GO ON *

47:33.150 --> 47:40.386
* MEET ME ON THE ROAD,
MEET ME WHERE I SAID *

47:40.490 --> 47:47.282
* BLAME IT ALL UPON
A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD *
