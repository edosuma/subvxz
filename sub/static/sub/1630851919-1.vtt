Nobody comes in.

28:57.416 --> 28:58.333
We're closed.

28:58.833 --> 29:00.083
Well, open up.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.458
For good. You can take
your worthless junk elsewhere.

29:04.541 --> 29:06.291
[groans]
Just as well.

29:06.375 --> 29:08.916

29:11.041 --> 29:13.000
[both laugh]

29:13.083 --> 29:15.125
-Ekko. What's going on with that thing?
-[grunts]

29:15.208 --> 29:17.916
Give me a few seconds.
The cannon pinion's still busted.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.416
Finish it later. Vander and I need a word.

29:20.500 --> 29:22.291
-But--
-[Benzo] Uh-uh. Off you go.

29:22.375 --> 29:23.708
[metal clanks]

29:23.791 --> 29:24.916
[Ekko grunts]

29:28.083 --> 29:30.041
-[Ekko] Claggor.
-[Claggor] He-he-hey, Little Man.

29:30.583 --> 29:31.666
You're a little early.

29:32.166 --> 29:34.875
My guys are still roundin' up
this month's collections.

29:34.958 --> 29:37.250
Won't have numbers until next, um…

29:38.041 --> 29:38.916
[Benzo] Whoo.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.083
Why are you muckin' about with this?

29:42.166 --> 29:44.041
I assume you've heard.

29:44.125 --> 29:46.041
Yeah, me and half the undercity.

29:46.125 --> 29:49.833
[sighs]
How could they be so stupid?

29:49.916 --> 29:52.375
The younger folk think
it's the right thing to do.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.291
[Vander] Yeah, and Vi's one of them.

29:54.375 --> 29:57.250
Throws herself at trouble
wherever she can find some.

29:57.333 --> 29:59.333
Eh, they're growing up, Vander.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.708
Looking to write their own stories.
You can't protect them forever.

30:03.791 --> 30:04.833
[sighs]

30:05.333 --> 30:06.500
Someone was following them.

30:06.583 --> 30:10.041
-Whole lot of someones, from what I heard.
-Not enforcers.

30:10.666 --> 30:12.750
-Someone on our side.
-Who?

30:14.666 --> 30:17.250
There's worse things
than enforcers out there.

30:18.708 --> 30:19.833
We both know that.

30:21.708 --> 30:23.458
Yeah, I was hopin' you'd be working today.

30:23.541 --> 30:25.333
-Did you guys go?
-Sure did.

30:25.416 --> 30:28.125
Hey, listen, how did you find that place?

30:28.208 --> 30:30.708
-I just--
-Whoa, did you fight the enforcers?

30:30.791 --> 30:32.583
What? Oh, no. Eh, just some bums.

30:32.666 --> 30:34.625
Oh, did Vi kick their asses?

30:34.708 --> 30:36.666
Yeah, I mean,
I wouldn't be here otherwise.

30:36.750 --> 30:39.708
Oh, she showed me
a couple moves to practice. Look.

30:39.791 --> 30:42.333
[Ekko grunting]

30:42.416 --> 30:44.458
-Yeah, it's… it's coming along.
-Ya!

30:44.541 --> 30:46.541
Hey, so, how'd you find
that place, anyway?

30:46.625 --> 30:48.833
Uh, this weirdo came into the shop.

30:48.916 --> 30:51.791
Bought a whole bunch of stuff
Benzo only keeps there for display.

30:51.875 --> 30:54.125
He paid in gold and didn't even haggle.

30:54.208 --> 30:57.000
I charged him double price. Sucker.

30:57.083 --> 31:00.500
-But how did you know where he lived?
-Uh, followed him.

31:00.583 --> 31:02.666
-How else?
-Oh. Right.

31:03.750 --> 31:04.916
[Claggor] Oh, crap.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.291
[breathing]

31:08.500 --> 31:11.125
-Uh…
-They'll be fine. Go.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Well, hello.

31:16.791 --> 31:19.333

31:28.000 --> 31:29.500
-[Benzo] Evening, friends.
-[hissing]

31:30.375 --> 31:31.833
[whispers]
Shit.

31:35.208 --> 31:36.166
[sighs]

31:36.250 --> 31:37.791
Something I can help you with?

31:37.875 --> 31:41.500
Some trencher trash attacked one
of the buildings in the Academy district,

31:41.583 --> 31:43.083
but you already knew that.

31:43.166 --> 31:45.125
We're looking for the culprits.

31:45.208 --> 31:46.208
Got a description?

31:46.291 --> 31:50.166
Yeah, it's exactly who you're picturing
in that thick head of yours.

31:50.250 --> 31:52.416
Mm. You think my head is thick?

31:52.500 --> 31:54.583
Uh, just past the average.

31:54.666 --> 31:55.958
Listen, you shady son of a…

31:56.041 --> 31:58.791
[enforcer] How about you go
for a little walk, Marcus?

31:58.875 --> 32:00.375
Cool off a bit.

32:01.541 --> 32:02.541
Go.

32:03.875 --> 32:05.083
[slurps]

32:11.083 --> 32:12.041

32:21.541 --> 32:23.250

32:31.333 --> 32:32.708
[Benzo] Lovely chap you've brought.

32:33.416 --> 32:35.916
[indistinct chatter]

32:38.416 --> 32:39.583
[enforcer] Don't mind the kid.

32:39.666 --> 32:41.666
Doesn't know when to pipe down.

32:41.750 --> 32:44.250
[Vander] Some things are the same
topside and bottom.

32:49.208 --> 32:51.125
You know this crossed a line upstairs.

32:51.208 --> 32:52.416
Was anyone hurt?

32:52.500 --> 32:55.416
A building was blown to bits.
What do you think?

32:56.166 --> 32:57.416
[sighs]

32:57.500 --> 33:00.541
Those who did this will be dealt with.

33:00.625 --> 33:03.291
That workshop belonged to the Kirammans.

33:04.125 --> 33:06.125
You know what kind of stuff
they had in there?

33:06.791 --> 33:09.250
Makes this place look like a candy shop.

33:10.041 --> 33:12.750
The Council needs someone
to make an example of.

33:12.833 --> 33:14.583
People need to feel safe.

33:14.666 --> 33:16.416
Yeah, topside people.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.291
[enforcer] We had a deal, Vander.

33:18.375 --> 33:22.375
You keep your people off my streets,
and I stay out of your business.

33:24.416 --> 33:26.875
Give me a name. We'll do things quiet.

33:26.958 --> 33:28.958
No one will know you were involved.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.500
I can't do that.

33:31.083 --> 33:33.791
You don't seem to grasp
how serious this is.

33:33.875 --> 33:36.250
If I don't put someone
behind bars tonight,

33:36.333 --> 33:40.375
the next time I come down here,
I'll have an army of enforcers with me.

33:40.458 --> 33:42.583
We both know how that'll go.

33:42.666 --> 33:46.583
I'm sorry, Grayson,
but I can't offer up my own people.

33:50.916 --> 33:51.833
[exhales]

33:52.375 --> 33:55.208
If you change your mind,
this will reach me.

33:56.708 --> 33:57.833
[Grayson] And only me.

33:57.916 --> 33:59.833

34:24.208 --> 34:25.625
What are you calling this one?

34:28.208 --> 34:29.500
[Powder] Whisker.

34:32.208 --> 34:34.666
-You wanna talk about today?
-What's the point?

34:35.375 --> 34:37.958
I ruined everything. I always do.

34:38.041 --> 34:39.333
Nobody said that.

34:39.416 --> 34:43.416
No. Just that you were
"twice the person" at half my age.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.083
You heard them.

34:46.166 --> 34:48.083
I'm not a fighter.

34:48.166 --> 34:49.500
You don't have to be.

34:51.083 --> 34:54.916
Look, I've got these and you've got those.

34:55.416 --> 34:56.583
They never work.

34:57.500 --> 34:58.416
They will.

34:59.833 --> 35:01.416
-Come with me.
-What?

35:02.166 --> 35:03.208
[Vi] Come on.

35:07.583 --> 35:10.625
[background chatter]

35:18.583 --> 35:19.625
What are we doing here?

35:20.958 --> 35:22.833
See that gutter running along the canal?

35:31.083 --> 35:34.041
[Vi] That's where Claggor got his foot
stuck running from enforcers.

35:35.916 --> 35:38.125
They thought it was funny,
so they left him there.

35:39.333 --> 35:41.125
He was out all night before we found him.

35:43.583 --> 35:44.541
That sign?

35:47.625 --> 35:49.208
-[Vi] You see it?
-[Powder] Uh-huh.

35:49.750 --> 35:51.666
Mylo tripped over his own paint bucket

35:51.750 --> 35:54.458
and nearly fell off trying to draw
a giant middle finger.

35:55.625 --> 35:58.166
-[Vi] His ass made that splotch.
-[Powder laughs]

36:00.375 --> 36:01.333
And that?

36:03.041 --> 36:03.875
[Vi sighs]

36:03.958 --> 36:07.875
When I was a kid, some guy took
my favorite toy and threw it up there.

36:09.166 --> 36:11.458
I used to come out here at night
and stare at it,

36:12.791 --> 36:17.375
hoping maybe the wind
or a bird might knock it down.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.625
We've all had bad days.

36:23.708 --> 36:27.083
But we learn. And we stick together.

36:30.666 --> 36:32.291
Oh, I forgot.

36:33.458 --> 36:34.541
These were in my pocket.

36:35.375 --> 36:37.958
-They're from the apartment.
-What are they?

36:39.958 --> 36:40.958
I don't know.

36:42.125 --> 36:44.083
-Should we show Vander?
-No.

36:47.125 --> 36:48.250

36:48.875 --> 36:50.833
Let's keep this our little secret.

36:52.125 --> 36:56.000
Mylo's wrong, Powder.
You're stronger than you think.

36:57.166 --> 36:58.333
And one day…

36:59.500 --> 37:01.541

I'm sorry.

is asking questions about you.
