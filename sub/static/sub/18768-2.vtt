00:34.240 --> 00:38.040
Esther, don't
forget to smile, please.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.000
Do have a drink.
Enjoy the gardens.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.360
The Literary Festival
will be starting very soon.

00:47.560 --> 00:48.840
It's funny because it's true.

00:52.760 --> 00:53.800
You did it, darling.

00:53.880 --> 00:54.960
We did it.

00:55.040 --> 00:56.680
Oh.

00:56.760 --> 00:58.440
Would you give me
an interview, please?

00:58.520 --> 01:00.360
Oh, this is my husband,
Dr Oliver Wolf.

01:00.440 --> 01:02.960
(OLIVER CHUCKLES)
You know it's you
they want, Professor.

01:07.960 --> 01:11.360
Er, Esther,
um, can I get you a glass?

01:11.440 --> 01:13.840
No, thanks.

01:13.920 --> 01:16.200
It's a three-day celebration
of Caribbean literature.

01:16.280 --> 01:20.760
In all its forms. Tours,
readings, book signings.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.240
(CROWD APPLAUSE)

01:22.320 --> 01:24.320
And of course our star guest,
Sylvie Baptiste.

01:24.400 --> 01:25.760
Welcome.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.760
This is her family estate.

01:27.840 --> 01:31.120
And the setting
of her most celebrated novel,

01:31.200 --> 01:32.440
The Flame Tree.

01:32.520 --> 01:35.560
A pleasure to be hosting
the first year of this

01:35.640 --> 01:37.280
wonderful festival.

01:37.360 --> 01:38.520
(CROWD APPLAUSE)

01:38.600 --> 01:40.360
Oh, well...

01:40.440 --> 01:42.920
After the reading, please.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.120
Remind me not to invite you
to my next party.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.800
Esther? I was wondering

01:55.880 --> 01:58.360
if you had had a chance to

01:58.440 --> 02:00.000
think about our little chat.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.800
I have.
The answer is still no.

02:07.520 --> 02:08.480
(CHUCKLES)

02:14.600 --> 02:17.680
Okay. We'll see.

02:17.760 --> 02:18.720
(APPLAUSE)

02:20.800 --> 02:22.880
Ladies and gent...
(MICROPHONE FEEDBACK)

02:22.960 --> 02:24.440
Oh.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.520
Try again.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.520
Ladies and gentlemen.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.720
Welcome to the very first
Saint Marie
Literature Festival.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.160
To kick things off,
we're starting with a talk

02:36.240 --> 02:38.560
from Sylvie
Baptiste's long-time editor

02:38.640 --> 02:40.960
and assistant
Patricia Lawrence.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.000
(APPLAUSE)

02:49.840 --> 02:52.240
Thank you, Anna.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.840
When Donald and
Iris first meet

02:54.920 --> 02:58.280
in The Flame Tree,
they are worlds apart.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.320
Where did Esther go?

03:00.400 --> 03:03.400
And it's easy to
see how the beauty
not only of this island...

03:03.480 --> 03:04.680
Maybe I should go
and look for her.

03:04.760 --> 03:06.280
No, no. Not now.

03:06.360 --> 03:10.440
...all gathered today
inspires Sylvie Baptiste.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.320
This estate is very much...

03:18.880 --> 03:20.720
It's in this sacred place

03:20.800 --> 03:24.360
that Donald learns
about the power of Obeah.

03:25.840 --> 03:26.840
Sorry.

03:29.200 --> 03:32.320
It's here that he
buys a love-spell,

03:32.400 --> 03:36.600
one that will
bind Iris to him,
even against her will.

03:50.040 --> 03:52.760
...throwing a red haze...

03:52.840 --> 03:56.200
...through them,
the setting for
Iris' attempted escape...

03:56.280 --> 03:58.440
...when she first
found the estate

03:58.520 --> 04:02.000
and got lost
exploring the many pathways

04:02.080 --> 04:04.720
that eventually
lead to the ocean.

04:04.800 --> 04:07.000
Let me read to
the text at this point.

04:08.560 --> 04:11.280
"Her heart was
burning in her chest.

04:11.360 --> 04:14.040
"But she heard his voice
in the garden behind her,

04:14.120 --> 04:16.800
"calling her away
from the cliffs.

04:16.880 --> 04:19.280
"But she wanted to
see over the cliff.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.800
"Over the water,

04:20.880 --> 04:23.880
"all the way to the horizon
and beyond it."

04:28.760 --> 04:30.720
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

(PHONE CHIMES)

05:15.760 --> 05:16.720
(CHUCKLES)

05:27.760 --> 05:31.200
Never realised
the Commissioner's
reports were so much fun, sir.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.960
DWAYNE: Had that smile
on his face all week.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.200
Just like me granny
when she'd been at the rum.

05:35.280 --> 05:37.800
Do we take it things
are going well with Martha?

05:37.880 --> 05:39.160
Could say that, Florence.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.480
Could say that.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.000
She's moving in
for the rest of her stay.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.160
Nice one, Chief!
Yes.

05:46.240 --> 05:47.640
(PHONE RINGS)
Yes.

05:47.720 --> 05:48.920
FLORENCE: So when
is she planning to move in?

05:49.000 --> 05:49.960
HUMPHREY:
End of the week, Florence,

05:50.040 --> 05:51.600
when she returns
from Montserrat.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.680
Actually,
I could do with
a hand at the shack.

05:53.760 --> 05:56.920
Eh, I need to
clear out some junk.
Make it into more of a...

05:57.000 --> 05:58.040
Love shack?

05:58.120 --> 05:59.280
JP: Thank you very much.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.720
(MUMBLES)

06:00.800 --> 06:03.720
Sir, body of a young woman's
just been found

06:03.800 --> 06:06.240
on the beach of
the Malbonne estate.

06:06.320 --> 06:07.280
Malbonne?

06:08.440 --> 06:10.280
That's Sylvie Baptiste's home.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.000
So who is Sylvie Baptiste?

06:14.080 --> 06:16.520
She wrote a novel
we all studied at school.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.880
Set on Saint Marie.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.720
The Flame Tree?
You've read it?

06:19.800 --> 06:21.160
Heard of it of course,

06:21.240 --> 06:23.080
but I had no idea
it was set on the island.

06:23.160 --> 06:26.040
It's about
an Englishman who falls
in love with an islander,

06:26.120 --> 06:28.440
Iris, a former slave.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.160
He marries her
against her will

06:30.240 --> 06:32.680
and when she realises
she's enslaved again,

06:32.760 --> 06:35.920
in a different way,
she kills herself.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
How?

06:37.080 --> 06:38.400
She jumps from the cliffs.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.000
Well, the paramedics
say her injuries

06:48.080 --> 06:50.200
are consistent with
a fall from this height.

06:50.280 --> 06:53.160
JP's up on
the clifftop near where
she fell cordoning it off.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.280
Do we know who she is?

06:54.360 --> 06:55.680
Her name's Esther Monroe,

06:55.760 --> 06:58.080
a PhD student
currently living in England.

06:58.960 --> 06:59.960
Esther Monroe?

07:00.040 --> 07:01.040
Mmm-hmm.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.760
I went to school with her.

07:11.840 --> 07:14.120
Really? Was she a friend?

07:14.200 --> 07:15.440
For a while.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.240
But she and her
family moved to England

07:17.320 --> 07:18.800
when we were teenagers.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.080
A long time ago.

07:21.160 --> 07:22.400
Well, I'm sorry, Florence.
Are you okay to carry on?

07:24.760 --> 07:26.800
Sure. Of course.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.760
HUMPHREY:
So who found the body?

07:29.840 --> 07:32.560
DWAYNE: Her tutor, Anna Wolf,
and her husband, Oliver.

07:32.640 --> 07:33.880
They went looking
for her after she went

07:33.960 --> 07:35.440
missing from
an event up at the house.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.600
An event?
Literary festival.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.400
You know, readings, lectures,
you know, things like that.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.360
If you can call
that a festival.

07:43.440 --> 07:44.720
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

07:44.800 --> 07:47.440
So, watch smashed
and stopped at 1:25,

07:47.520 --> 07:49.080
so I think we can call
that time of death.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.000
Do you know how old
she would've been?

07:51.080 --> 07:54.000
She was a year below me.
So, 26.

07:54.880 --> 07:55.880
So young.

07:57.480 --> 07:59.680
Okay, Dwayne.
We can release the body.

07:59.760 --> 08:01.960
Then let's take a look up top.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.640
Morning, JP.
Morning, sir.

08:09.720 --> 08:10.680
Sarge.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.200
HUMPHREY: So in the novel,

08:14.280 --> 08:16.680
this is where Iris
jumped from, right?

08:16.760 --> 08:19.480
It's become a bit
of a tourist destination.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.400
You've all read it, I suppose?

08:21.480 --> 08:24.000
Of course, sir.
It's required
reading at school.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.520
I can't imagine
anyone growing up

08:25.600 --> 08:27.480
on this island
having not read it.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.680
And that includes me, Chief.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.440
It's one of my favourites.

08:31.520 --> 08:33.160
Really, sounds like
I've got some
catching up to do.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.800
Right, JP, what have you got?

08:34.880 --> 08:37.040
Well, sir.
The victim's bag
was found just here.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.360
Uh, I've gone through it.

08:38.440 --> 08:39.800
And nothing out
of the ordinary.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.640
Purse,
pen, diary, laptop cable.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.120
And then... This.

08:49.640 --> 08:54.000
(READING)

08:54.080 --> 08:56.600
"Please forgive me.
I love you. Esther."

09:00.560 --> 09:01.640
Poor Esther.

09:01.720 --> 09:02.920
Yes.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.360
Strange, isn't it?

09:05.200 --> 09:06.400
What is?

09:06.480 --> 09:07.760
That she chose to
write that letter

09:07.840 --> 09:09.760
on a computer,
print it and then sign it.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.520
Seem somewhat impersonal,
rather formal.
Wouldn't you say?

09:14.040 --> 09:15.080
(FLORENCE SIGHS)

09:15.160 --> 09:16.840
Montblanc fountain pen.

09:17.680 --> 09:18.680
These aren't cheap.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.280
Is something
troubling you, sir?

09:27.840 --> 09:29.720
Well, there is a bit,
JP, if I'm honest.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.680
It's that suicide note.
It doesn't quite make sense.

09:32.760 --> 09:34.360
That it wasn't handwritten?

09:34.440 --> 09:36.120
Yes, that.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.920
But also that
Esther's signature
is written in biro.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.200
Esther uses a rather
expensive fountain pen

09:40.280 --> 09:42.280
to write all her
appointments in her diary.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.600
But when it comes to signing
her final
letter to her family,

09:44.680 --> 09:46.400
she plumps for a biro.

09:46.480 --> 09:49.360
Like I say, strange. Isn't it?

09:59.440 --> 10:02.920
So, Chief, there are around
about 100 guests here today.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.040
Anna Wolf is pretty sure

10:04.120 --> 10:05.800
Esther didn't have any contact

10:05.880 --> 10:07.320
with any of them until
they arrived
here this morning.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.800
Okay, then talk to
the other guests,

10:08.880 --> 10:10.200
confirm whether
Anna's right about that.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.440
Also, the laptop cable
we found in Esther's bag

10:12.520 --> 10:14.760
would imply she has a laptop.
See if you can
find it hereabout.

10:14.840 --> 10:15.800
Chief.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.440
(CLEARS THROAT)

10:20.320 --> 10:21.840
Er, DI Humphrey Goodman.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.200
DS Florence Cassell.

10:23.280 --> 10:26.520
I understand you
both found Esther?

10:26.600 --> 10:28.640
Do you have any
idea what happened?

10:28.720 --> 10:30.120
Was it accidental?
We found a note.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.920
Oh, God.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.760
I know this is
a difficult time

10:33.840 --> 10:35.480
but I need to ask
a few questions.

10:37.240 --> 10:39.320
When did you last
all see Esther alive?

10:39.400 --> 10:42.320
I noticed her
leaving the garden,
at about...

10:43.400 --> 10:44.440
Quarter past one.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.560
HUMPHREY: You're sure?

10:48.640 --> 10:49.840
PATRICIA: Quite sure.
I was on stage
about to start my talk.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.080
I saw her then too.

10:51.160 --> 10:52.280
So did I.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.360
Leaving the garden alone?

10:53.440 --> 10:54.400
Yeah.

10:56.320 --> 10:58.120
And where were you all
for the next 10 minutes?

10:58.200 --> 11:02.200
In the audience,
listening to Patricia.
All of us were.

11:02.280 --> 11:05.360
Er, can you tell me about how
Esther seemed over
the last few days?

11:05.440 --> 11:07.160
Er, her mood, behaviour?

11:07.240 --> 11:09.080
Barely left her hotel room,

11:09.160 --> 11:11.200
since we
arrived five days ago.

11:11.280 --> 11:13.120
Do you know why?
She was working
late every night.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.240
On a new
chapter of her thesis.

11:15.320 --> 11:16.720
It was on The Flame Tree.

11:16.800 --> 11:19.240
She was doing some
research here on the island.

11:19.320 --> 11:20.640
What sort of research?

11:20.720 --> 11:21.920
She hadn't
shared it with me yet.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.320
It was obviously
preoccupying her.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.960
Obsessing her, even.
Really?

11:27.360 --> 11:29.600
Esther was a very
dedicated student.

11:29.680 --> 11:30.840
Cared about her work.

11:32.280 --> 11:34.800
Perhaps a little too much.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.760
Er, did you have
any contact with Esther?

11:36.840 --> 11:40.680
She was here yesterday,
helping me with
the festival admin.

11:40.760 --> 11:44.360
Printing the programmes,
setting up the equipment.

11:44.440 --> 11:47.040
And, er, Sylvie, er,
did you speak to her then?

11:47.120 --> 11:48.920
Yesterday,
no more than a word or two.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.920
Erm, didn't she go to see you
on Thursday, to interview you?

11:55.280 --> 11:57.920
She did.
And we spoke
a little more then.

11:59.160 --> 12:00.520
What did she
want to talk about?

12:00.600 --> 12:02.160
Well, my writing.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.520
She had some
research questions.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.400
Like Anna said,

12:06.480 --> 12:08.720
I did notice she
seemed a little tense.

12:08.800 --> 12:09.840
Do you know why?

12:09.920 --> 12:11.880
I have no idea.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.360
Presumably she was already
planning to throw
herself off my cliff.

12:17.360 --> 12:19.320
Hmm.
(CLEARS THROAT)

12:19.400 --> 12:22.400
And you say you
were still all present
at Patricia's talk at 1:25.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.120
Are there other guests
who can confirm this?

12:24.200 --> 12:26.120
Ask anyone else
in the audience.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.400
There were 100 people here
and we were
sitting in the front row.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.880
But Esther jumped, didn't she?
She wasn't...

12:32.960 --> 12:34.840
Well, we're not ruling
anything out just yet.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.440
Okay, thank you.

12:40.520 --> 12:42.440
Er, we'll be in touch
with any further questions.
Bye.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.840
JP: Sir?
HUMPHREY: Yes.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.880
JP: We looked around
and there's no sign
of Esther's laptop.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.160
DWAYNE:
And we've spoken to most

12:52.240 --> 12:53.320
of the other
guests and it's true.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.120
They only know
Esther from meeting her

12:55.200 --> 12:56.520
after they arrived
earlier this morning.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.400
Listen a couple noticed

12:58.480 --> 13:00.280
Esther leaving the grounds
during Patricia
Lawrence's talk.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.240
Any of them notice
anyone following Esther?

13:02.320 --> 13:03.800
Apparently, everyone remained

13:03.880 --> 13:06.360
in their seat
for the duration of the talk.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.520
What are you thinking, sir?

13:09.600 --> 13:11.480
I'm thinking that if,
as I suspect,

13:11.560 --> 13:14.120
that suicide note was faked
and Esther was
pushed to her death.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.520
Then,
as there seem to be only four

13:15.600 --> 13:16.880
people at
the festival who knew her,

13:16.960 --> 13:18.280
it has to be one
of them that did it.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.320
But, Chief,

13:20.400 --> 13:22.200
if they were all in full view
when it happened
it can't be, can it?

13:22.280 --> 13:25.040
No, Dwayne.
It can't. You're right.

13:25.120 --> 13:27.680
We need to get that note
dusted for prints
as soon as possible.

13:27.760 --> 13:29.160
Also, Dwayne, JP,

13:29.240 --> 13:30.520
find out if there
was anyone else present

13:30.600 --> 13:32.240
on the estate at
the time of death.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.200
Apart from the guests I mean.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.600
Any staff, neighbours,
anyone who may have
witnessed anything.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.400
Also, there's a small bungalow
over there, I noticed.

13:38.480 --> 13:39.960
Might be worth checking out.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.280
In the meantime, Florence,

13:42.360 --> 13:44.040
let's take a look
at Esther's hotel room.

13:44.120 --> 13:46.600
If she's been holed up
there since she arrived,

13:46.680 --> 13:49.440
it might give us an idea about
what she's been
up to this week.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.480
Good idea, sir.
Oh, and, er,

13:51.560 --> 13:53.840
we should call
Esther's parents.

13:57.560 --> 13:58.840
(SIGHS)

13:58.920 --> 14:00.600
Of course we will.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.920
And again, I am so sorry.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.560
We'll speak soon. Bye.

14:05.400 --> 14:06.560
How were they?

14:06.640 --> 14:08.760
Shocked and devastated,
of course.

14:08.840 --> 14:12.440
But they refused to believe
Esther would kill herself.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.440
They were aware
she was stressed
by her studies.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.120
But not to the extent she...

14:16.200 --> 14:18.400
Well, that tallies
with our thinking.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.000
The receptionist
said she saw Esther

14:20.080 --> 14:22.720
arguing with a male English
guest two nights ago.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.240
Sounded like Oliver Wolf
from her description.

14:25.320 --> 14:27.040
We should get in touch
with Esther's university.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.600
See if they can
offer us any insight

14:28.680 --> 14:30.800
into her relationship
with Professor and Dr Wolf.

14:31.680 --> 14:32.640
(DOOR OPENS)

14:35.840 --> 14:37.680
Looks like she really
was burning the midnight oil.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.160
What a mess.

14:42.240 --> 14:44.240
Right, let's see if
Esther's laptop is here.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.360
Strange.

14:51.440 --> 14:52.440
She left her phone here.

14:58.680 --> 15:01.160
These look like
notes for her thesis.

15:09.920 --> 15:12.320
We used to love
collecting shells as kids.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.360
We used to go to
the beach after school.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.160
And then she moved to England?

15:16.240 --> 15:18.200
Did you stay in touch?

15:18.280 --> 15:21.280
Yeah. Wrote a few times,
but that was it.

15:21.360 --> 15:24.160
Until today,
I haven't thought
about her for years.

15:26.600 --> 15:27.800
Anything on her phone?

15:27.880 --> 15:29.920
I've only had
a quick look through,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.600
but it seems to me that Esther
liked to keep
herself to herself.

15:32.680 --> 15:36.000
Hardly any personal texts
or, or photos, even.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.800
There's no sign
of her laptop either,
is there?

15:37.880 --> 15:39.440
No, there isn't.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.840
Someone's taken it,
haven't they? Why?

15:42.960 --> 15:44.520
I don't know, Florence.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.720
But as we now not only have
a suspicious suicide note,

15:46.800 --> 15:49.040
but also a laptop
that's gone missing.

15:49.120 --> 15:51.440
I'm sorry to say that
we're treating
Esther's death as murder.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.040
JP: Oh.
(CHUCKLES)

15:57.120 --> 15:58.880
I have never been to
the Baptiste
estate before, Dwayne.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.720
DWAYNE: Me neither.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.960
JP: To think this
is where the book
actually takes place

16:03.040 --> 16:04.560
it really brings it to life,
don't you think?

16:04.640 --> 16:07.320
(STAMMERS) Oh, yes, JP.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.680
I'm seeing it very much
in a new light now.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.240
Hey, what's your favourite
part of the book, Dwayne?

16:13.280 --> 16:14.480
Uh, Honore police.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.840
(KNOCKS ON THE DOOR)
Can you open up please?

16:16.920 --> 16:18.280
You know what, JP,

16:18.360 --> 16:20.120
I don't think
there's anyone at home,
you know.

16:20.200 --> 16:21.520
Uh, wait a minute, Dwayne.

16:27.960 --> 16:31.160
Oh. Good afternoon, madame.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.640
We're investigating an
incident that's taken
place near here.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.320
Did you happen to
see a young woman,

16:36.400 --> 16:40.160
early 20s, heading towards
the cliff at about 1:15 today?

16:40.240 --> 16:42.200
Sorry. No.

16:43.440 --> 16:44.800
Do you live here alone?

16:44.880 --> 16:46.440
Er, excuse me...

16:46.520 --> 16:47.480
(LATCHES THE DOOR)

16:48.360 --> 16:49.880
Nice to meet you too!

16:51.760 --> 16:52.800
Some people, eh?

16:54.720 --> 16:55.680
(GRUNTS)

16:57.080 --> 16:58.040
JP.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.840
Well, it does look like the
same handwriting to me.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.040
But then it could
just be a good forgery.

17:06.120 --> 17:07.800
It's not hard to do.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.280
Sir.
Yes?

17:09.360 --> 17:12.080
I've just spoken
to the Dean of the university.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.920
He said Esther had
made an appointment

17:14.000 --> 17:15.800
with the union
welfare officer.

17:15.880 --> 17:18.320
He didn't know why
but I've asked
her to get in touch.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.560
Mmm-hmm.

17:19.640 --> 17:22.200
So our victim dies
in an apparent suicide.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.960
She'd been on
the island five days

17:24.040 --> 17:26.000
and we've established she only
had contact with four people.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.720
They were...

17:27.800 --> 17:29.600
Professor Anna Wolf, 44,

17:29.680 --> 17:31.200
Esther's tutor

17:31.280 --> 17:34.680
and Head of
the English Faculty
at Esther's university.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.880
The Dean spoke
very highly of her.

17:36.960 --> 17:40.520
Seems to be
the star of her department.
Married to...

17:40.600 --> 17:42.400
Oliver Wolf, 43.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.880
An academic, too,
but we can't find
much about him online.

17:44.960 --> 17:47.200
Hasn't published anything
for some years, it seems.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.960
Sylvie Baptiste, 66.

17:49.040 --> 17:52.080
Big deal novelist,
lived on Saint
Marie all her life.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.520
And Patricia Lawrence, 46.

17:53.600 --> 17:54.880
Lives at the estate.

17:54.960 --> 17:57.640
Originally from
Lewisham in the UK.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.200
How long she been here?
25 years.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.120
Apparently,
she came here
whilst travelling,

18:02.200 --> 18:03.640
got a temporary
job as Sylvie's

18:03.720 --> 18:05.200
assistant and
ended up staying.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.160
Er, and the woman
in the bungalow.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.080
Did she give a name?
Name?

18:09.160 --> 18:10.760
She slammed
the door in my face.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.360
Seemed very
reluctant to talk to us.

18:12.440 --> 18:13.720
Suspiciously so?

18:13.800 --> 18:15.960
I don't think so, sir.

18:16.040 --> 18:18.880
There's something about her.
She didn't seem well.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.520
Okay. Well, erm,
call Patricia.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.840
(PHONE RINGS)
See if she can tell
us who lives there.

18:21.920 --> 18:23.280
Right. Dwayne,

18:23.360 --> 18:24.960
get the suicide
note fingerprinted.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.920
And get in touch
with Esther's
internet provider.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.440
See what her emails show up.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.520
Also, er, check
with immigration

18:30.600 --> 18:32.040
and find out about Sylvie

18:32.120 --> 18:34.160
and Patricia's travels
over the last few years.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.720
See if there's any
chance that either

18:35.800 --> 18:38.080
of them may have crossed
paths with Esther before.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.920
Chief.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
Sir, that was
the university
welfare officer.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.520
Apparently,

18:44.600 --> 18:47.120
Esther had reported
a case of sexual harassment

18:47.960 --> 18:50.280
against Oliver Wolf.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.720
Well,
it comes with the territory.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.360
The odd flirtation.

18:55.440 --> 18:56.920
Nothing more than that.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.760
What exactly
happened between you?

19:00.840 --> 19:03.400
Well, it was at
a seminar recently, erm,

19:04.560 --> 19:06.000
drank too much red wine.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.080
We ended up kissing.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.920
Look, these girls are young,

19:11.000 --> 19:12.920
they're hormonal.
If you're
halfway decent looking

19:13.000 --> 19:14.400
and under 50,

19:16.240 --> 19:17.400
they do flirt.

19:17.480 --> 19:20.000
Yes, er, thing is, Oliver.

19:20.080 --> 19:23.240
We just spoke to the union
welfare officer
at your university.

19:23.320 --> 19:25.880
They told us that Esther's
version of that seminar

19:25.960 --> 19:27.240
is rather
different from yours.

19:27.320 --> 19:28.840
You were the one drunk.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.400
You were the one
who cornered her
in your office.

19:30.480 --> 19:32.400
And the next morning,
Esther made an appointment

19:32.480 --> 19:34.000
to report you for
sexual harassment.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.320
But I think you
already know that,
don't you?

19:37.760 --> 19:40.520
We spoke to the receptionist
at your hotel.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.800
She said she saw you
and Esther arguing,

19:42.880 --> 19:44.080
two nights before she died.

19:44.160 --> 19:45.160
I had...

19:47.040 --> 19:48.480
Nothing to do with her death.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.240
What were you and
her arguing about?

19:52.160 --> 19:53.560
(SIGHS)

19:53.640 --> 19:55.600
I was just trying
to get her to be reasonable.

19:55.680 --> 19:57.800
Had she threatened
to tell your wife?
After all, Anna was her tutor.

19:57.880 --> 19:59.280
I swear,
I was only going there to...

19:59.360 --> 20:00.720
Perhaps you wanted
to shut Esther up

20:00.800 --> 20:02.040
before she could
do any more damage!

20:02.120 --> 20:03.240
Anna knew!

20:05.600 --> 20:06.840
Anna always knows.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.240
She turns a blind eye.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.600
Why on earth
would she do that?

20:10.680 --> 20:12.640
Because I've sacrificed
everything for her!

20:12.720 --> 20:15.760
She's the star academic,
her career always comes first,

20:15.840 --> 20:17.960
while I'm the one
who rubs her feet,
does the laundry

20:18.040 --> 20:19.880
and makes sure
there's food in the fridge.

20:19.960 --> 20:23.000
And in return she allows you
a few discreet,
er, dalliances?

20:23.080 --> 20:24.080
Yes.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.600
It may seem a little
dysfunctional to you,
Inspector.

20:30.680 --> 20:32.360
But it works for us.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.120
Except, with Esther
making a complaint,

20:35.200 --> 20:38.000
things had become
slightly less discreet.
Hadn't they?

20:38.080 --> 20:39.080
I suppose so.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.760
Which makes me wonder
how Anna felt about it all.

20:46.720 --> 20:47.680
Huh?

20:54.800 --> 20:56.240
HUMPHREY: He told us you knew
all about it.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.400
Of course, I didn't.

20:57.480 --> 20:58.600
He told us you had a deal.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.480
About you turning a blind eye.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.280
Of course, you couldn't turn
a blind eye to that,
could you?

21:02.360 --> 21:05.040
I mean he'd pushed it too far.
Wrecked your cosy agreement.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.320
I mean a few discreet affairs,

21:06.400 --> 21:08.280
fine, but a sexual
harassment charge?

21:08.360 --> 21:09.600
I mean that would
really take the shine off

21:09.680 --> 21:11.400
the university's
golden couple.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.680
I had no idea
about this "charge".
Okay.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.360
Florence,
call Ms Hoskins would you.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.640
See if she can
clear this up for us.

21:18.600 --> 21:19.560
Wait!

21:20.160 --> 21:21.120
(SIGHS)

21:23.520 --> 21:24.480
Look he...

21:25.880 --> 21:28.720
He wasn't meant to
go after students!

21:28.800 --> 21:30.520
It was only ever meant
to be women I didn't know.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.560
Things I would never
have to hear about.

21:32.640 --> 21:35.520
But of course, Ollie
couldn't resist
a girl like Esther.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.200
I'm sure he saw
her as a challenge.

21:37.280 --> 21:39.080
So you knew Esther
had reported him?

21:40.040 --> 21:42.120
Yes, I knew.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.400
And it was only
a matter of time

21:43.480 --> 21:44.880
before something
like this happened.

21:44.960 --> 21:47.760
(SIGHS)
I thought it was a good deal.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.800
I needed his
support in my career.

21:49.880 --> 21:50.960
But the truth is,

21:52.040 --> 21:53.640
I could've coped on my own.

21:53.720 --> 21:56.040
Then why let him
get away with it?

21:57.920 --> 21:58.880
Because I loved him.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.320
Idiotic, I know.

22:03.960 --> 22:05.560
You don't think that I had

22:05.640 --> 22:07.560
anything to do with
Esther's death, do you?

22:07.640 --> 22:09.000
Well,
you can see how it looks.

22:09.080 --> 22:10.800
She was a threat
to your marriage
and your career.

22:11.720 --> 22:12.960
My marriage is over.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.480
It has been for a long time.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.480
HUMPHREY: Now our victim
was on the cusp of reporting

22:25.560 --> 22:29.200
Oliver Wolf to the university
authorities for
sexual harassment.

22:29.280 --> 22:32.360
Which means that both he
and his wife had
a great deal to lose.

22:32.440 --> 22:34.760
Either or indeed both of them

22:34.840 --> 22:36.200
had reason to kill her.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.240
Yeah, but as they were sat
next to each other

22:38.320 --> 22:40.520
in the front row during
Patricia Lawrence's talk

22:40.600 --> 22:43.080
at the exact
moment Esther died.

22:43.160 --> 22:46.960
In theory,
neither of them
could have done it.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.760
Dwayne.
How are you getting on?

22:48.840 --> 22:51.320
Well, Chief,
I've fingerprinted
the suicide note.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.720
And?

22:52.800 --> 22:55.000
I'm afraid only
Esther's prints are on it.

22:55.080 --> 22:56.680
I also checked
with immigration.

22:56.760 --> 22:59.080
Seems Sylvie and
Patricia travel a lot.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.640
All over the world.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.440
The life of
a celebrated novelist, eh.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.280
Whilst Patricia's
never been back to the UK,

23:04.360 --> 23:06.440
Sylvie's made four trips
there in the last seven years

23:06.520 --> 23:08.360
for other literary festivals.

23:08.440 --> 23:09.800
But after a quick check,

23:09.880 --> 23:11.840
Esther wasn't in attendance
at any of them.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.680
So it's highly
unlikely they met

23:13.760 --> 23:15.440
prior to Esther's
arrival on the island.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.360
Thank you, Dwayne.

23:17.440 --> 23:19.960
Er, JP, anything of interest
from our
victim's email account?

23:20.040 --> 23:21.360
(SIGHS)
Well, erm,

23:21.440 --> 23:22.960
I've looked back
over the last six months.

23:23.040 --> 23:25.400
And there are four emails
sent to Patricia Lawrence,

23:25.480 --> 23:28.080
requesting an interview
with Sylvie Baptiste.

23:28.160 --> 23:30.360
All politely refused.
Esther pretty much...

23:30.440 --> 23:31.840
Keeps herself to herself.

23:31.920 --> 23:33.240
That's the impression we got.

23:33.320 --> 23:34.600
Oh, also.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.400
I left a message for Patricia

23:36.480 --> 23:38.720
to call me back about
whoever lives
in that bungalow.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.920
But in the meantime,
I checked
the Electoral Register

23:41.000 --> 23:43.480
and the owner is
Sylvie Baptiste.

23:43.560 --> 23:45.280
No occupier registered.

23:45.360 --> 23:46.400
How odd.

23:46.480 --> 23:47.920
Chase Patricia.
We need to find

23:48.000 --> 23:49.360
out who her
mysterious tenant is.

23:49.440 --> 23:50.800
Yes, sir.
Ah, but do it

23:50.880 --> 23:52.080
first thing in the morning.
It's getting on.

23:52.160 --> 23:54.120
We should, erm, call it a day.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.000
I'd also like to
pop into the library

23:56.080 --> 23:59.280
before it closes.
Get a copy of
The Flame Tree to read.

23:59.360 --> 24:02.000
Er, but if anyone fancies
a beer after I've done that,

24:02.080 --> 24:03.560
Chief is buying.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.520
(STAMMERS)
That's very
good of you, Chief.

24:05.600 --> 24:08.120
Yes, well, I'd like to pick
your brains
about Sylvie's novel.

24:08.200 --> 24:09.280
As you've all read it.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.720
(STAMMERS) Of course!

24:11.360 --> 24:12.760
Florence?

24:12.840 --> 24:14.360
Er, beer maybe?

24:14.440 --> 24:16.160
I just want to finish
going through Esther's notes.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.200
I'll see you there.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.480
Yes, yes.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.680
Ah.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.360
On the Chief's tab, Catherine.

24:39.160 --> 24:40.920
Mmm-hmm.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.360
"Victor Pearce
standing for Mayor."

24:43.440 --> 24:45.000
(EXCLAIMS)

24:45.080 --> 24:47.200
Just as bad as the last one.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.040
I love this island.

24:49.120 --> 24:50.960
But I wish that, just once,

24:51.040 --> 24:53.720
we could elect a mayor
who deserves the job.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.320
And what's so bad about him?

24:55.400 --> 24:56.960
A bully and a crook.

24:57.040 --> 24:58.840
Out drinking every night.

24:58.920 --> 25:01.440
And it all goes on
his expense account.

25:01.520 --> 25:04.120
Never pays for a thing.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.080
Well,
er, maybe you should stand,
Catherine.

25:06.160 --> 25:08.120
I mean, I personally
think you'd do a great job.

25:08.200 --> 25:09.520
(CHUCKLES)

25:09.600 --> 25:10.640
What's so funny about that?

25:11.160 --> 25:12.680
Nothing.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.720
My drink went
down the wrong way.

25:20.720 --> 25:21.760
Here we go, sir.

25:21.840 --> 25:23.920
Ah!

25:24.000 --> 25:27.280
Fine beer and
classic literature.
What more could a man want?

25:27.360 --> 25:28.360
Indeed.
Mmm-hmm.

25:28.440 --> 25:29.440
You enjoying the book, sir?

25:29.520 --> 25:31.200
Mmm. Very much.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.320
You liked it as well, Dwayne?

25:33.560 --> 25:35.360
Me?

25:35.440 --> 25:37.480
Yes, er, er what did
you make of it when
you first read it?

25:37.560 --> 25:40.680
Er, well, you know, er,

25:40.760 --> 25:43.720
er, look it's,
er, richly evocative.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.320
A classic tale of
destiny and desire.

25:48.440 --> 25:49.480
Wow!
Crikey.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.600
It's a triumph of post co...

25:53.840 --> 25:55.000
Colonialism.

25:59.120 --> 26:01.040
Kathy Morrison,
New York Herald.

26:02.360 --> 26:03.320
(CHUCKLES)

26:03.920 --> 26:05.480
Okay.

26:05.560 --> 26:07.680
Okay.
So maybe I didn't
quite get to the end.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.760
Where is Florence?
I thought she'd
be here by now.

27:03.640 --> 27:04.680
Excuse me.

27:11.600 --> 27:12.640
Morning all, morning.

27:12.720 --> 27:14.080
Morning, Chief.
Morning, Chief.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.600
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't get to
sleep till 5:00.

27:16.680 --> 27:19.040
I could not put this down.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.680
Esther's parents called me
first thing this morning.

27:21.760 --> 27:24.360
They'd remembered something
she said about
uncovering a secret

27:24.440 --> 27:26.640
during the research
she'd been doing
here on the island.

27:26.720 --> 27:27.920
A secret? About what?

27:28.000 --> 27:29.360
They didn't know.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.400
But they said
she'd seemed worried about it.

27:31.480 --> 27:32.800
Nervous.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.640
I started going
through her notes here,

27:34.720 --> 27:37.280
seeing if there's any clue
as to what it is was...

27:37.360 --> 27:39.120
But no joy?
Not yet.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.760
It looks like some
kind of textual analysis.

27:41.840 --> 27:44.800
Comparing different
works by Sylvie Baptiste.

27:44.880 --> 27:47.320
Word usage,
er, styles of phrasing.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.640
I'll keep looking.

27:48.720 --> 27:51.560
Also, I found this
matchbox from a bar,

27:51.640 --> 27:53.960
in amongst the things
we took in Esther's room.

27:54.040 --> 27:57.000
I went to visit it last night
and showed them her picture.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.320
Did they recognise her?

27:58.400 --> 28:01.240
The barman said Esther
didn't really talk much.

28:01.320 --> 28:03.640
But she showed
some interest in this.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.080
It was hanging on the wall.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.280
Sylvie Baptiste.
Not just her.

28:07.360 --> 28:08.400
Look at the caption.

28:09.320 --> 28:11.000
Lizzie Baptiste, too.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.160
Lizzie Baptiste?

28:12.240 --> 28:14.000
Turns out it's
Sylvie's sister.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.840
There's a record of birth
and where she went to school.

28:16.920 --> 28:19.520
But after that, nothing.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.840
It's like she
just disappeared.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.480
Gosh, how strange.

28:23.560 --> 28:25.920
Could this be the secret
Esther discovered?

28:26.000 --> 28:28.120
I can't see any secret,
exactly.

28:28.200 --> 28:29.720
Just not many records of her.

28:29.800 --> 28:33.280
I think this is the woman
from the bungalow.

28:33.360 --> 28:37.760
I mean she's a bit older now,
but same eyes. No?

28:37.840 --> 28:39.000
Mmm-hmm.

28:39.080 --> 28:40.960
So Sylvie's sister
is living on her estate,

28:41.040 --> 28:43.520
not 100 metres away
from the scene of the crime

28:43.600 --> 28:45.560
and Sylvie
neglected to mention it?

28:45.640 --> 28:47.880
I think you need to pay
this Lizzie another visit.

28:47.960 --> 28:48.960
Hmm.
Chief.

28:59.880 --> 29:00.960
Morning.

29:02.080 --> 29:03.320
It's Lizzie, isn't it?

29:03.400 --> 29:04.480
Hmm.

29:04.560 --> 29:06.240
I'm JP Hooper.

29:06.320 --> 29:08.760
This is Officer Myers.

29:08.840 --> 29:11.560
You need to
speak to my sister.

29:11.640 --> 29:13.360
I don't like to have visitors.

29:15.440 --> 29:16.640
(LATCHES THE DOOR)

29:24.400 --> 29:25.480
Er, Lizzie.

29:27.920 --> 29:31.360
I see your plants
need a bit of a weeding.

29:31.440 --> 29:33.280
Would you like us
to help you
tidy them up a bit?

29:35.160 --> 29:36.480
It'll be our pleasure.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.440
(OPENS THE DOOR)

29:48.440 --> 29:49.400
Hmm.

29:52.520 --> 29:54.200
So you live alone, Lizzie?

29:54.280 --> 29:55.240
Mmm-hmm.

29:57.440 --> 29:59.200
Does your sister
come and visit you?

30:00.360 --> 30:01.400
She's good to me.

30:02.840 --> 30:04.120
She takes care of me.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.440
How long have
you lived here for?

30:10.520 --> 30:12.840
A long time. Since...

30:14.840 --> 30:16.600
I came out of the hospital.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.440
You weren't well?

30:19.520 --> 30:20.480
Hmm.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.800
Things went a bit wrong.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.200
Up here.

30:31.040 --> 30:33.640
She wanted to know about

30:33.720 --> 30:34.760
a poem.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.240
Who did?

30:42.320 --> 30:43.320
The girl.

30:44.680 --> 30:46.360
The one whose body you found.

30:47.920 --> 30:51.360
I told her I don't know
anything about any poem.

30:53.120 --> 30:55.440
Ah, where exactly
did you speak to her?

30:55.520 --> 30:57.880
She came here.

30:57.960 --> 31:01.640
I told her I don't
like having visitors,

31:01.720 --> 31:05.520
but she wouldn't listen.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.000
And, and when was this?

31:08.920 --> 31:11.560
Couple of days ago, I think.

31:13.880 --> 31:16.880
Lizzie, where was you
yesterday lunchtime?

31:18.520 --> 31:20.320
Yesterday?

31:20.400 --> 31:22.720
Just before the first
time we first visited you.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.560
I was here.

31:28.640 --> 31:29.680
All morning.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.400
A poem?

31:36.480 --> 31:38.680
Apparently,
that's what Esther
was interested in.

31:38.760 --> 31:40.360
I wonder why?

31:40.440 --> 31:42.320
And why on earth, would
she want to talk
to Lizzie about it?

31:42.400 --> 31:44.320
I mean,
Sylvie doesn't
write poetry, does she?

31:44.400 --> 31:45.760
She writes novels.

31:45.840 --> 31:47.840
That's what
Esther was researching.

31:47.920 --> 31:50.400
I think I saw some
poetry in the notes

31:50.480 --> 31:53.160
that Esther was
making for her thesis.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.040
And she can't say for sure

31:55.120 --> 31:57.160
where she was at the time
Esther was
pushed off the cliff?

31:57.240 --> 31:59.000
No, Chief.
But I don't think

31:59.080 --> 32:00.840
that that's our
killer though, sir.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.120
I mean,
I know she's vulnerable.

32:02.200 --> 32:03.440
Had some sort of...

32:03.520 --> 32:05.400
Yes, yes, I know, JP.
I'm sorry.

32:06.600 --> 32:08.560
But she currently has no alibi

32:08.640 --> 32:11.080
and she was in the vicinity
of the murder at
the time it happened.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.640
We have to do due diligence
and add her to the board.

32:13.720 --> 32:14.720
I, I'm sorry.

32:23.680 --> 32:24.800
There it is.

32:24.880 --> 32:25.960
Thank you.

32:27.240 --> 32:29.480
(HUMPHREY READS)

32:29.560 --> 32:31.960
"Perhaps if I
jump I will be free."

32:32.040 --> 32:34.720
I'm sure I've seen
that in the novel somewhere.

32:34.800 --> 32:37.240
That's when Iris
goes to the cliff
for the first time.

32:37.320 --> 32:38.520
That's it! That's it!

32:38.600 --> 32:39.600
Now where is that?

32:39.680 --> 32:41.880
Er, about halfway through.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.480

visits the Obeah-woman...

HUMPHREY: Oh, here we are.

32:46.760 --> 32:49.440
"Perhaps I'll fly if I jump.

32:49.520 --> 32:51.400
"Perhaps I'll be free."

32:51.480 --> 32:53.080
That's almost
identical to the poem.

32:53.160 --> 32:55.960
The phrasing's just
slightly different.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.640
And what's that
number next to it?

32:57.720 --> 33:00.360
I don't know.
There's a few of
them in the notes.

33:00.440 --> 33:01.720
All eight digits.

33:01.800 --> 33:03.440
It's a phone number maybe.

33:03.520 --> 33:05.160
No.
I don't think so.

33:05.240 --> 33:06.760
There's a number
on the book, Chief.
Eight digits.

33:06.840 --> 33:07.920
Where?
There.

33:10.480 --> 33:12.840
(CHUCKLES)
They're library
reference numbers.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.960
So, Esther was researching
all this at Honore library.

33:15.040 --> 33:16.680
Dwayne,
I want you to get down there.

33:16.760 --> 33:18.520
See if you can find whatever
it was Esther was digging out.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.280
Right away, Chief!
(CLEARS THROAT)

33:25.520 --> 33:28.160
Where would
the library be, exactly?

33:30.320 --> 33:31.280
I'll come with you.

33:45.040 --> 33:46.760
(COUGHS)

33:46.840 --> 33:49.040
Shh.

33:49.120 --> 33:50.960
Why do they keep
all this old stuff,
Sarge?

33:51.040 --> 33:52.800
It's a library.

33:52.880 --> 33:54.640
It's a fire hazard,
is what it is.

33:55.840 --> 33:56.920
(SIGHS)

33:57.000 --> 33:58.400
You should read it.

33:58.480 --> 34:00.680
I think you might enjoy it.

34:00.760 --> 34:02.880
510 pages! You must be joking!

34:02.960 --> 34:04.080
(SLAMS BOOK ON THE TABLE)

34:04.160 --> 34:05.320
Shh.

34:05.400 --> 34:06.360
What?

34:13.640 --> 34:14.600
Dwayne.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.680
Elizabeth Baptiste.

34:17.760 --> 34:19.520
Listed here in the index.

34:20.280 --> 34:21.280
Oh!

34:24.160 --> 34:26.240
It's the poem
Esther wrote out.

34:26.320 --> 34:28.160
Similar to
the lines in the novel.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.040
But it's by Lizzie Baptiste.

34:30.120 --> 34:32.160
Published two years before
The Flame Tree.

34:32.240 --> 34:34.120
So Sylvie stole her lines?

34:34.200 --> 34:36.480
Maybe that's
not all she stole.

34:36.560 --> 34:37.760
Esther's notes compare

34:37.840 --> 34:40.000
The Flame Tree
to Sylvie's other works.

34:40.080 --> 34:41.800
There are
significant differences.

34:41.880 --> 34:45.480
It's almost like she's
comparing two
different authors.

34:45.560 --> 34:49.080
Is it possible that the secret
Esther discovered is that...

34:49.160 --> 34:50.560
There are two
different authors?

34:50.640 --> 34:52.680
That Sylvie didn't write
The Flame Tree at all?

34:52.760 --> 34:53.760
That Lizzie did?

34:53.840 --> 34:55.280
And Sylvie found
the manuscript?

34:55.360 --> 34:57.560
I think that's what
Esther's research was about

34:57.640 --> 35:00.800
and that's why she was writing
a new chapter for her thesis.

35:00.880 --> 35:02.720
It explains why
she was so stressed,

35:02.800 --> 35:04.760
why she hadn't felt
able to tell anyone.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.160
But why would
Lizzie allow her sister

35:06.240 --> 35:07.680
to take the credit
for all her work?

35:07.760 --> 35:09.640
Well, Lizzie
doesn't remember the poem.

35:09.720 --> 35:11.600
So, maybe she didn't remember
the novel either?

35:11.680 --> 35:13.640
Is it possible
that you'd forget
you wrote a novel?

35:13.720 --> 35:17.000
If her breakdown was as severe
as she says it was then,
yes, maybe.

35:17.080 --> 35:19.000
But if that is the case,

35:19.080 --> 35:20.440
then Sylvie
Baptiste must have thought

35:20.520 --> 35:21.800
she'd committed
the perfect fraud

35:21.880 --> 35:23.920
until the day
Esther came along.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.280
And threatened to ruin it all.

35:27.240 --> 35:29.920
Esther came to see me here,
yes, as I already told you.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.600
A strange girl.

35:32.680 --> 35:33.800
What did she
want to talk about?

35:33.880 --> 35:37.320
Oh, my creative methods,

35:38.040 --> 35:39.840
my inspirations.

35:39.920 --> 35:42.800
I told her I have only two.

35:44.200 --> 35:45.640
The beauty of this island,

35:47.120 --> 35:49.800
and single malt whisky.

35:49.880 --> 35:52.280
Did she tell you
about her research?

35:52.360 --> 35:54.040
I don't believe she did.

35:54.120 --> 35:55.960
I've read the novel.
It's incredibly powerful.

35:56.040 --> 35:59.480
Soucriants flying round
the island as balls of flame.

35:59.560 --> 36:01.000
Obeah magic.

36:01.080 --> 36:03.120
Must need a very vivid
imagination to write that.

36:03.200 --> 36:05.120
No imagination required.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.800
My grandmother
was an Obeah woman.

36:07.880 --> 36:10.200
She had the power
of love and death.

36:11.080 --> 36:12.840
Real power.

36:12.920 --> 36:15.240
Because
the people believed in her.

36:15.320 --> 36:18.240
Amazing what people
will buy, isn't it?

36:18.320 --> 36:20.080
If it's sold to them
with enough panache.

36:23.680 --> 36:26.200
Ms Baptiste, we have a warrant
to search your house.

36:32.440 --> 36:33.960
Idea for a short story.

36:36.760 --> 36:38.520
A married woman
in a close knit...
Sylvie?

36:38.600 --> 36:41.280
...community begins
an affair with
a Parish Priest.

36:41.360 --> 36:42.360
What's going on?

36:43.920 --> 36:45.640
She was obsessive.

36:45.720 --> 36:46.920
She was losing her mind.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.320
Obsessive, yes.
Losing her mind? No.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.080
Esther knew she
was onto something.

36:51.160 --> 36:52.680
She believed she'd
discovered a secret.

36:52.760 --> 36:54.160
That the original manuscript

36:54.240 --> 36:55.560
of The Flame Tree
had been written by Lizzie.

36:55.640 --> 36:58.760
Esther discovered a poem
that Lizzie had written.

36:58.840 --> 37:01.440
About a young woman who,
unable to cope with life,

37:02.440 --> 37:04.880
throws herself off a cliff.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.280
We've been
researching your background.

37:07.360 --> 37:10.080
You were rejected
by publishers many times.

37:10.160 --> 37:11.880
And then suddenly,
you came up with
The Flame Tree.

37:11.960 --> 37:13.400
And you were
an instant critical hit.

37:14.920 --> 37:16.400
Did you find
a manuscript of Lizzie's,

37:16.480 --> 37:17.800
decide to keep
it for yourself?

37:21.880 --> 37:24.360
Lizzie would never
have done anything with it!

37:26.280 --> 37:28.040
She never worked at it.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.200
She didn't deserve it.

37:30.280 --> 37:32.960
She would write
things and forget them,
like a child.

37:33.040 --> 37:37.080
(CHUCKLES)
I was the one who
took things seriously.

37:37.160 --> 37:39.440
I was the one who
gave it to the world.

37:42.520 --> 37:43.480
(COUGHS)

37:45.560 --> 37:46.520
Chief?

37:47.840 --> 37:49.360
It's Esther's laptop.

37:49.440 --> 37:51.440
We found it in Ms
Baptiste's room.

37:51.520 --> 37:52.480
You stole it.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.680
She did.

37:56.760 --> 37:58.280
HUMPHREY:
On your instructions,
no doubt.

37:58.360 --> 37:59.640
You said you'd got rid of it.

37:59.720 --> 38:01.200
Tell us exactly
what happened when

38:01.280 --> 38:03.560
Esther came to see
you on Thursday morning.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.960
She asked me

38:06.040 --> 38:09.360
if I had any original notes
for The Flame Tree.

38:09.440 --> 38:11.400
Anything to prove
that it'd been my work.

38:11.480 --> 38:14.280
She said she had a new
chapter for her thesis

38:14.360 --> 38:16.520
which posited that
I wasn't the author.

38:17.560 --> 38:18.760
I think a part
of her was still

38:18.840 --> 38:19.920
hoping that I
would prove her wrong.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.280
But you couldn't.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.200
So she said she'd
go ahead and publish.

38:24.400 --> 38:25.960
She had the laptop with her.

38:27.200 --> 38:28.760
The new chapter was on it.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.240
Which you then instructed
Patricia to steal from her.

38:31.320 --> 38:33.360
HUMPHREY:
While Esther was helping
you prepare for the festival.

38:40.040 --> 38:42.200
But you knew
she'd just
rewrite the chapter?

38:42.280 --> 38:43.240
I panicked.

38:44.320 --> 38:45.960
I wanted to delay her.

38:46.040 --> 38:48.360
Esther's work threatened
to destroy your
reputation and career.

38:48.440 --> 38:50.720
You needed to deal
with matters more permanently.

38:50.800 --> 38:51.960
I didn't kill her.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.680
You needed to
make absolutely sure

38:53.760 --> 38:55.480
that she would never breathe
a word about what a fraud

38:55.560 --> 38:56.960
her idol had turned out to be.

38:57.040 --> 38:58.360
You're right. I am a fraud.

39:01.400 --> 39:03.600
I told myself I
could help Lizzie.

39:03.680 --> 39:04.720
Could look after her better.

39:06.440 --> 39:08.080
The truth is I
did it for myself.

39:10.640 --> 39:11.720
I may be a fraud

39:12.800 --> 39:14.280
but I am not a murderer.

39:19.880 --> 39:21.920
I need to go and
lie down for a while.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.520
We've got
the book signing at 5:00.

39:23.600 --> 39:25.120
You can do that beforehand.

39:25.200 --> 39:26.640
Tell the guests I am not well.

39:29.240 --> 39:30.400
If you'll excuse me.

39:31.760 --> 39:33.320
You stole for Sylvie.

39:33.400 --> 39:36.000
I wonder would you
kill for her too?

39:36.080 --> 39:37.840
Sylvie got nervous,
didn't she?

39:37.920 --> 39:39.960
She knew Esther
would just rewrite it.

39:40.040 --> 39:41.800
She asked you to do
one more thing for her.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.320
The ultimate act of loyalty

39:43.400 --> 39:46.160
from an employee whose
devotion knows no bounds.

39:46.240 --> 39:48.080
I'm afraid that's
where you're wrong.

39:48.160 --> 39:50.480
I wish I could summon
the sort of
devotion you imagine.

39:50.560 --> 39:52.800
I wish to God
Sylvie inspired it.

39:52.880 --> 39:55.040
I have no pension, no savings.

39:55.120 --> 39:56.880
I work 12-hour days that end

39:56.960 --> 39:59.520
in putting her to bed drunk,
and mopping up her vomit.

40:01.240 --> 40:03.200
I draw the line at
killing for her, too.

40:12.280 --> 40:14.920
(CLEARS THROAT)

40:15.000 --> 40:17.960
Sylvie Baptiste.
She, er,
she had everything to lose.

40:18.040 --> 40:20.200
A lifetime's
worth of reputation
destroyed in an instant.

40:20.280 --> 40:22.000
Or Patricia Lawrence.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.760
Loyal assistant
protecting her employer.

40:23.840 --> 40:25.200
Either one of them
could've done it.

40:25.280 --> 40:26.360
Maybe they were
in it together?

40:26.440 --> 40:27.560
Maybe.

40:27.640 --> 40:29.000
But they,
like Mr and Mrs Wolf,

40:29.080 --> 40:30.640
were in full
view of an audience

40:30.720 --> 40:33.960
of 100 in the 10-minute
window when Esther was killed.

40:34.040 --> 40:35.640
Which leaves Lizzie
Baptiste as the only

40:35.720 --> 40:37.240
suspect who
doesn't have an alibi.

40:37.320 --> 40:39.200
Sir...
But

40:39.280 --> 40:40.920
why would Lizzie
want to kill Esther Monroe?

40:41.760 --> 40:43.280
She hardly knew her.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.680
And, it seems, knew nothing

40:44.760 --> 40:47.280
of the long-held secret
Esther was uncovering.

40:47.360 --> 40:49.200
And then there's
that fountain pen.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.080
(MURMURING)

40:52.160 --> 40:53.720
I'm afraid we're not
gonna solve this tonight.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.280
Let's call it a day for now.

40:56.360 --> 40:57.760
Pick up again tomorrow.

40:57.840 --> 40:59.440
Come on, I'll buy you a beer.

41:02.800 --> 41:04.800
Florence?

41:04.880 --> 41:07.640
I thought I might make a start
looking through
Esther's laptop.

41:07.720 --> 41:10.160
Actually,
you said you'd help me
tonight.

41:11.400 --> 41:12.480
Not often I pull rank.

41:15.680 --> 41:16.640
Come on.

41:22.840 --> 41:25.800
So, earlier,

41:25.880 --> 41:27.000
this gardening thing.

41:31.200 --> 41:32.160
You did well, JP.

41:33.640 --> 41:34.600
I was impressed.

41:36.760 --> 41:38.120
Ah, Catherine.

41:38.200 --> 41:41.400
So, JP. I decided
to take your advice.

41:41.480 --> 41:43.760
Could use a little more
idealism in politics.

41:43.840 --> 41:45.480
The spirit of protest!

41:45.560 --> 41:46.600
A woman's touch.

41:46.680 --> 41:47.760
Wouldn't you say, Dwayne?

41:47.840 --> 41:48.800
You better believe it!

42:05.440 --> 42:07.040
Okay.

42:07.120 --> 42:09.520
If you haven't used
it in three months,
it goes.

42:09.600 --> 42:12.040
Very good.

42:12.120 --> 42:14.200
Ah, no,
I wear that
rather a lot actually.

42:17.280 --> 42:18.240
Ugh.

42:20.360 --> 42:21.560
Thanks for
helping me, Florence.

42:24.480 --> 42:26.360
I know you feel
a responsibility to Esther.

42:31.040 --> 42:32.480
But I keep thinking,

42:32.560 --> 42:34.400
maybe if I'd stayed in touch

42:34.480 --> 42:36.280
things would've
been different for her.

42:36.360 --> 42:38.760
It's not your
fault Esther died,
Florence.

42:38.840 --> 42:40.480
She was harassed.

42:40.560 --> 42:42.520
She was stolen from.

42:42.600 --> 42:45.000
She spent a week
on this island alone

42:45.080 --> 42:47.040
with no one to turn
to and she ended up

42:47.120 --> 42:49.280
on that clifftop
with someone who...

42:52.760 --> 42:54.880
If I'd been a friend to her,

42:54.960 --> 42:56.640
if I hadn't forgotten her.

42:56.720 --> 42:58.320
You can't think like that.

42:58.400 --> 43:00.280
Looking back and dwelling
on the ifs, buts and maybes,

43:00.360 --> 43:01.400
is a fool's game.

43:02.560 --> 43:05.160
What Esther needs most now

43:05.240 --> 43:07.480
is for a detective to catch
the person that
did this to her.

43:08.280 --> 43:09.640
Okay?

43:09.720 --> 43:10.720
And you'll help me?

43:12.960 --> 43:14.200
I'm surprised you need to ask.

43:18.360 --> 43:20.240
Come on. Lots to do.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.600
Morning, Florence. JP.

43:31.680 --> 43:33.120
Morning, sir.
No Dwayne?

43:33.200 --> 43:34.400
Not yet but,
sir, you should come

43:34.480 --> 43:35.560
and look at what
Florence has found.

43:35.640 --> 43:36.960
Oh, yes?

43:37.040 --> 43:38.640
Something interesting
on Esther's laptop.

43:38.720 --> 43:41.040
A video file.
Recorded on Thursday.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.600
Lizzie,
can you remember this poem?

43:47.360 --> 43:49.040
If we read it together,

43:49.120 --> 43:51.040
in the place
where you wrote it,

43:51.120 --> 43:52.240
it might help you remember...

43:53.600 --> 43:56.120
The poem we read is
set on the cliffs.

43:56.200 --> 43:58.000
So maybe Lizzie Baptiste

43:58.080 --> 44:00.000
did go to
the clifftop with Esther.

44:00.080 --> 44:01.880
She is the only suspect
not to have an alibi.

44:01.960 --> 44:03.760
Except the faked suicide note.

44:03.840 --> 44:05.960
I don't think she
can plan something like that.

44:06.040 --> 44:08.800
If Esther was going
to the clifftop
to meet Lizzie,

44:08.880 --> 44:11.400
could someone have
seen her going there

44:11.480 --> 44:13.440
and decided to follow her?

44:13.520 --> 44:15.040
No, no, it's too convenient.

44:15.120 --> 44:16.920
Whoever did this
knew that Esther

44:17.000 --> 44:19.480
would be on the cliff
and planned their
alibi accordingly.

44:19.560 --> 44:20.960
I just don't know
how they were able

44:21.040 --> 44:22.440
to make it
appear like they were

44:22.520 --> 44:24.440
at the festival with
the rest of the attendees,

44:24.520 --> 44:27.600
when they were
actually on the clifftop
committing murder. It's...

44:28.560 --> 44:29.920
Sorry I'm late, Chief.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.200
Overslept.

44:31.280 --> 44:33.040
Up late on a school night?

44:33.720 --> 44:34.880
No, Sarge,

44:34.960 --> 44:36.520
finishing
The Flame Tree actually.

44:37.080 --> 44:38.040
No way.

44:39.440 --> 44:40.440
Audio book.

44:41.440 --> 44:42.440
Yeah, that's cheating!

44:42.520 --> 44:43.520
What did you think?

44:43.600 --> 44:44.680
Loved it.

44:44.760 --> 44:47.800
Glass of rum,
feet up, headphones in,

44:47.880 --> 44:49.320
I think I'll start
reading more often.

44:50.160 --> 44:51.480
Mmm. Listen...

44:52.760 --> 44:54.560
SYLVIE BAPTISTE: Chapter 57.

44:54.640 --> 44:58.560
Iris woke early
the next morning
and walked down to the beach.

44:58.640 --> 45:02.440
The storm had cleared by then
and the sea was calm.

45:02.520 --> 45:04.160
Like she's there
in my living room.

45:15.080 --> 45:17.080
Everything all right, Chief?

45:17.160 --> 45:18.960
In your living room, you said.
Like she was there
in your living room.

45:19.840 --> 45:22.040
Yes, Chief?

45:22.120 --> 45:24.720
So, watch smashed
and stopped at 1:25.

45:24.800 --> 45:27.280
There were 100 people here
and we were
sitting in the front row.

45:30.640 --> 45:32.520
What's going on?

45:32.600 --> 45:35.200
Didn't she go to
see you on Thursday,
to interview you?

45:35.280 --> 45:36.880
She did.

45:36.960 --> 45:38.200
She was working
late every night

45:38.280 --> 45:39.760
on a new
chapter of her thesis.

45:39.840 --> 45:41.000
If we read it together,

45:41.080 --> 45:42.600
in the place
where you wrote it...

45:42.680 --> 45:44.120
Montblanc fountain pen.

45:46.560 --> 45:47.680
The suicide note.

45:47.760 --> 45:49.880
How did they manage that? How?

45:49.960 --> 45:51.480
We've got
the book signing at 5:00.

45:52.320 --> 45:53.800
Of course.

45:53.880 --> 45:55.320
That's how...

45:55.400 --> 45:56.560
Dwayne!
Chief!

45:56.640 --> 45:57.960
I need you to
collect the laptop

45:58.040 --> 45:59.520
from Sylvie's estate
and get it to the lab.

45:59.600 --> 46:01.440
I'm also gonna
need the folders

46:01.520 --> 46:03.240
containing our
background checks
and gather up the suspects.

46:03.320 --> 46:05.840
Most importantly,
Lizzie Baptiste.

46:05.920 --> 46:07.560
Sir...
Please.

46:07.640 --> 46:08.680
Just trust me on this.

46:14.640 --> 46:17.640
This place is quite something,
isn't it?

46:17.720 --> 46:20.320
The real-life
setting of a famous novel.

46:21.080 --> 46:22.400
Esther Monroe

46:22.480 --> 46:23.920
died here three days ago

46:24.000 --> 46:25.720
in what appeared
to be a suicide.

46:27.840 --> 46:28.920
She was anxious,

46:30.040 --> 46:31.400
obsessing about her work.

46:33.640 --> 46:35.720
Jumping from
the same cliff that her

46:35.800 --> 46:37.960
literary heroine
had jumped from,

46:38.040 --> 46:41.240
might seem like
the ultimate escape
from her problems.

46:42.600 --> 46:44.600
But this was no suicide.

46:46.520 --> 46:48.720
Esther was murdered.

46:51.360 --> 46:54.480
Now, Esther left
the party at 1:15 p.m.

46:54.560 --> 46:57.840
When her body was found,
her smashed
watch had stopped at 1:25.

46:59.880 --> 47:01.800
A hundred witnesses
vouch for you all being

47:01.880 --> 47:03.960
at Patricia's talk
during that period.

47:05.160 --> 47:06.240
In the front row.

47:06.320 --> 47:08.520
Patricia on stage.

47:08.600 --> 47:10.400
So it's
impossible that any of you

47:10.480 --> 47:13.000
could have left
to commit murder.

47:13.080 --> 47:15.760
Unless every one
of those impartial witnesses

47:16.640 --> 47:17.600
were mistaken.

47:19.960 --> 47:21.800
Which is exactly
what they were.

47:25.120 --> 47:26.880
Early on Thursday,

47:26.960 --> 47:28.760
the day before her death,

47:28.840 --> 47:32.000
Esther had been
to visit Sylvie Baptiste.

47:32.080 --> 47:33.480
Esther had confronted Sylvie

47:33.560 --> 47:36.840
about the true authorship
of The Flame Tree.

47:36.920 --> 47:39.400
She knew by then
her theory was right.

47:39.480 --> 47:42.800
But she wanted
one final piece of evidence.

47:42.880 --> 47:44.920
She wanted to talk
to Lizzie herself.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.960
(KNOCKS ON THE DOOR)

47:47.040 --> 47:49.720
To try an uncover Lizzie's
long-forgotten
memories of writing.

47:52.080 --> 47:53.440
Esther planned

47:53.520 --> 47:56.200
to record Lizzie's testimony

47:56.280 --> 47:58.200
on her laptop, which she did.

47:58.280 --> 47:59.960
Lizzie.

48:00.040 --> 48:01.440
Can you remember this poem?

48:01.520 --> 48:05.040
But Lizzie could
remember nothing.

48:05.120 --> 48:07.000
So Esther suggested
to visit the place

48:07.080 --> 48:08.520
where Lizzie wrote the poem.

48:09.240 --> 48:10.280
The clifftop.

48:11.760 --> 48:13.720
But we think Lizzie
wasn't the only person

48:13.800 --> 48:15.760
present during
this conversation.

48:18.280 --> 48:20.120
Which means that there would
be someone else

48:20.200 --> 48:22.360
who knew about the plan
to visit the cliff.

48:22.440 --> 48:23.960
In fact,
I believe they suggested it

48:24.040 --> 48:25.080
in the first place.

48:25.160 --> 48:27.680
A, er, "helpful" idea

48:27.760 --> 48:29.440
to tap into Lizzie's memories.

48:32.800 --> 48:34.000
Am I right, Lizzie?

48:35.760 --> 48:38.280
That someone else
was in that room that day?

48:40.520 --> 48:42.320
Yes.

48:42.400 --> 48:45.440
In fact, this person told
you to stay at
home didn't they,

48:45.520 --> 48:49.720
and went to meet Esther alone,
intent on murder.

48:52.680 --> 48:54.960
So, the following day,

48:55.040 --> 48:58.680
Esther left the, er,
festival
reception at 1:15 p.m.

48:58.760 --> 49:02.320
She knew that her research
would ruffle feathers.

49:02.400 --> 49:04.440
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

49:04.520 --> 49:06.480
HUMPHREY: Esther went
secretly to meet Lizzie

49:06.560 --> 49:10.200
at the clifftop
as she believed
she had previously arranged.

49:10.280 --> 49:12.160
But the person who
helped her to arrange it

49:13.880 --> 49:15.360
met her there alone.

49:17.880 --> 49:19.120
There are only two people who

49:19.200 --> 49:20.960
could've been the third
presence in that room.

49:21.040 --> 49:23.240
Who could've let
Esther into Lizzie's house,

49:23.320 --> 49:26.760
been present at the interview,
and thus known
about the clifftop plan.

49:29.200 --> 49:30.320
Sylvie Baptiste.

49:31.880 --> 49:33.200
Or Patricia Lawrence.

49:35.120 --> 49:36.360
You can't possibly believe...

49:36.440 --> 49:38.600
You were the third
person in that room.

49:39.520 --> 49:40.560
Am I right, Lizzie?

49:43.240 --> 49:44.880
Now once you told
Lizzie that the, er,

49:44.960 --> 49:47.840
clifftop rendezvous
wasn't happening any more,

49:47.920 --> 49:49.160
you then went and impressed

49:49.240 --> 49:50.920
on Esther the importance
of telling nobody else

49:51.000 --> 49:53.160
about the planned
meeting with Lizzie.

49:54.280 --> 49:55.400
And when the time came,

49:55.480 --> 49:57.240
you left the festival opening

49:58.520 --> 50:00.400
to meet with
Esther at the clifftop.

50:00.480 --> 50:02.600
This is ridiculous.
I was giving
a speech at the time she died.

50:02.680 --> 50:04.560
They all heard me.

50:04.640 --> 50:07.160
PATRICIA:
And this is the cliff
right here on the estate.

50:08.560 --> 50:09.520
Yes, they heard you.

50:10.920 --> 50:11.920
But did they see you?

50:13.560 --> 50:15.080
You see I must say
you had me fooled.

50:15.160 --> 50:16.840
Sylvie?
Until I remembered

50:16.920 --> 50:19.960
seeing you
typing Sylvie's notes
from her Dictaphone.

50:20.040 --> 50:22.120
See you're quite
adept at technology,

50:22.200 --> 50:23.240
aren't you, Patricia?

50:27.400 --> 50:29.280
You told us yourself
that you were in charge

50:29.360 --> 50:31.440
of setting up the laptop
and the AV
equipment for the festival.

50:31.520 --> 50:33.280
And you gave a presentation

50:33.360 --> 50:35.760
showing
the slides of the locations
of The Flame Tree.

50:35.840 --> 50:38.240
My colleague's audio book
made me wonder,

50:38.320 --> 50:40.320
what if you made
a recording of your speech?

50:40.400 --> 50:41.920
And this is the cliff

50:42.000 --> 50:43.880
right here on the Estate

50:43.960 --> 50:46.400
where Iris decides
she can no longer live

50:46.480 --> 50:48.480
with what Donald
has done to her.

50:48.560 --> 50:51.080
Now you started the, er,
talk genuinely enough.

50:51.160 --> 50:53.680
On stage,
holding a microphone.

50:53.760 --> 50:55.640
It's in this sacred place

50:55.720 --> 50:59.160
that Donald learns
about the power of Obeah.

50:59.960 --> 51:01.720
Sorry.

51:01.800 --> 51:03.720
But then I think
you retreated to the side

51:03.800 --> 51:05.040
to let the slides play.

51:05.120 --> 51:07.400
One that will
bind Iris to him,

51:07.480 --> 51:08.840
even against her will.

51:08.920 --> 51:10.680
HUMPHREY:
Where you then pressed play

51:10.760 --> 51:11.800
on the audio file

51:11.880 --> 51:13.840
you'd already set up.

51:13.920 --> 51:17.360
...with its
unique design seems
to add a sense of foreboding

51:17.440 --> 51:20.400
to every encounter
that Donald and Iris have.

51:24.040 --> 51:26.360
The second laptop
vital to solving this case.

51:26.440 --> 51:27.520
Your laptop.

51:27.600 --> 51:29.520
(BEEPS)
And this is the cliff,

51:29.600 --> 51:31.480
right here on the estate,

51:31.560 --> 51:33.640
where Iris decides
she can no longer

51:33.720 --> 51:34.880
live with what
Donald has done to her.

51:34.960 --> 51:36.040
(BEEPS)

51:37.240 --> 51:40.200
The recording
lasted for five minutes.

51:40.280 --> 51:41.480
And while
the audience would've sworn

51:41.560 --> 51:42.880
that you were still
there giving that talk,

51:42.960 --> 51:44.760
in fact you had slipped

51:44.840 --> 51:47.120
away to the clifftop,
to push a young
woman to her death.

51:50.600 --> 51:51.560
(SCREAMS)

51:55.400 --> 51:57.480
This is nonsense.
The girl killed herself.

51:57.560 --> 51:59.040
It's obvious.
She left a suicide note...

51:59.120 --> 52:00.720
Ah, yes,
the note was a nice touch.

52:00.800 --> 52:02.080
The fact that you'd got
Esther's fingerprints

52:02.160 --> 52:04.280
onto it and no one
else's was smart.

52:04.360 --> 52:05.760
And we already knew that, er,

52:05.840 --> 52:08.320
Esther had helped
you with the festival admin.

52:08.400 --> 52:11.200
I mean there would've been
reams of paper
with her prints on.

52:11.280 --> 52:12.720
All you had to do was, er,

52:12.800 --> 52:14.320
use some gloves
to take a piece

52:14.400 --> 52:16.840
print the note off
and then sign it.

52:16.920 --> 52:18.560
Sign it? How could I...

52:18.640 --> 52:20.840
Well, you sign Sylvie's books
for her when she's, er,

52:22.320 --> 52:23.640
indisposed.

52:23.720 --> 52:25.240
We've got
the book signing at 5:00.

52:25.320 --> 52:27.440
You can do that beforehand.

52:27.520 --> 52:28.800
Tell the guests I'm not well.

52:31.160 --> 52:33.320
For someone so practised
at forging signatures,

52:33.400 --> 52:35.840
it wouldn't be difficult
to forge Esther's handwriting.

52:35.920 --> 52:37.480
I'm sure it
would've been easy enough

52:37.560 --> 52:39.800
to lay your hands on a copy
of Esther's signature.

52:39.880 --> 52:41.600
And then all you
had to do was slip

52:41.680 --> 52:44.240
the faked suicide
note into her handbag

52:44.320 --> 52:45.520
after you'd killed her.

52:47.800 --> 52:52.000
But as clever as it was,
that suicide note
was also your undoing.

52:52.080 --> 52:55.400
That it was a typed note meant
that it somehow
lacked credibility.

52:55.480 --> 52:56.880
But also
the fact that Esther's

52:56.960 --> 52:59.000
signature was written
at the bottom in biro,

52:59.080 --> 53:01.520
rather than the fountain pen
that she always used,

53:01.600 --> 53:03.080
confirmed to me
that she neither

53:03.160 --> 53:05.120
wrote it nor signed it.

53:06.040 --> 53:07.640
Tell me this isn't true.

53:10.840 --> 53:14.520
Did Sylvie's loyal assistant
kill to protect her employer?

53:14.600 --> 53:16.040
I mean you've implied to us
that you were, er,

53:16.120 --> 53:17.920
Sylvie's personal slave.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.600
Working 12 hours a day,

53:19.680 --> 53:22.320
doing everything for her,
even putting her to bed.

53:22.400 --> 53:24.480
All for
a pittance of a salary.
All true.

53:26.960 --> 53:28.680
You didn't even get
the chance to visit home.

53:30.640 --> 53:31.960
That's not quite
so true, is it?

53:33.280 --> 53:34.840
Because we know
that Sylvie had visited

53:34.920 --> 53:37.120
the UK several
times on work trips.

53:37.200 --> 53:38.760
Sylvie's made four trips there

53:38.840 --> 53:41.000
in the last seven years
for other literary festivals.

53:41.080 --> 53:43.120
And our
immigration checks show

53:43.200 --> 53:45.800
that you did not
accompany her once.

53:45.880 --> 53:47.720
It's not that you didn't get
the chance to go home.

53:47.800 --> 53:49.080
You chose not to.

53:52.960 --> 53:54.160
We've looked into
your background.

53:54.240 --> 53:56.160
26 years ago
you came here travelling

53:56.240 --> 53:58.680
and through luck
and perseverance,

53:58.760 --> 54:01.560
you landed a job working
for a successful author.

54:01.640 --> 54:04.720
And what a life you've lived
over those last 20 odd years.

54:04.800 --> 54:07.120
You got to travel the world.
Meet other famous authors.

54:07.200 --> 54:09.080
And when you
haven't been doing that,

54:09.160 --> 54:11.200
you've been living
in this Caribbean paradise.

54:12.600 --> 54:13.920
Fantasy made real.

54:15.400 --> 54:17.320
Unfortunately,

54:17.400 --> 54:19.120
you realised that's
exactly what it was.

54:19.200 --> 54:22.240
A fantasy that could
be destroyed at any time.

54:22.320 --> 54:24.440
Was it when Esther first
got in touch that you, er,

54:24.520 --> 54:26.240
first realised that
Sylvie was a fraud?

54:28.800 --> 54:29.800
Hmm?

54:33.240 --> 54:35.520
No, I think
you've known for years,
haven't you?

54:37.000 --> 54:39.800
That's why you stopped
Esther meeting her.

54:39.880 --> 54:41.560
You knew what Esther was onto.

54:41.640 --> 54:43.520
And if Sylvie's
fraud had been exposed,

54:43.600 --> 54:45.200
you would be
the one person who had

54:45.280 --> 54:47.000
even more to lose
than Sylvie herself.

54:47.080 --> 54:48.400
The dream would
be over forever,

54:48.480 --> 54:50.560
and so you killed
an innocent young woman

54:50.640 --> 54:51.760
to protect it.

54:53.600 --> 54:55.440
She left me no choice,
don't you see?

54:57.080 --> 54:58.640
She was going to
destroy it all.

55:00.320 --> 55:01.320
Take her away.

55:01.400 --> 55:02.600
I had no choice!

55:02.680 --> 55:04.200
I had no choice!

55:05.840 --> 55:07.400
I had no choice!

55:09.800 --> 55:12.360
I want to fund a scholarship
in Esther's name.

55:12.440 --> 55:13.960
For the students of my work.

55:14.040 --> 55:16.640
We spoke to
the Head of Faculty
at Esther's university.

55:16.720 --> 55:19.600
They're planning to award
her PhD posthumously.

55:19.680 --> 55:22.920
So, I'm afraid it's Lizzie's
work from now on.

55:24.640 --> 55:25.960
Do you understand?

55:26.760 --> 55:28.160
It's your novel.

55:59.320 --> 56:03.440
You know,
I don't say
this nearly enough.

56:03.520 --> 56:05.680
But you are
a brilliant detective,
Florence Cassell.

56:07.880 --> 56:09.440
And a good friend.

56:09.520 --> 56:10.720
To Esther and to me.

56:13.440 --> 56:15.040
If ever I was in trouble,

56:15.120 --> 56:16.920
I can't think of anyone else
I'd rather have on my side.

56:19.400 --> 56:20.360
(CHUCKLES)

56:21.440 --> 56:23.000
You hungry?

56:23.080 --> 56:25.320
Fancy braving my cooking
and coming for
dinner at the shack?

56:26.160 --> 56:27.480
Is Martha back tonight?

56:27.560 --> 56:28.880
In an hour.

56:28.960 --> 56:30.080
If it's just the two of you...

56:30.160 --> 56:31.280
Harry'll be there too.

56:32.840 --> 56:34.040
I'm making shepherd's pie.

56:34.120 --> 56:35.640
(CHUCKLES)

56:35.720 --> 56:37.880
Then how can I resist?

56:37.960 --> 56:39.240
I'd better go and
get the spuds on.

56:40.960 --> 56:42.440
Join us when you're ready.

57:06.360 --> 57:08.640
Welcome to La Maison Cecile...
We've been expecting you.

57:08.720 --> 57:10.120
Let's get you up to the hotel.

57:10.200 --> 57:11.960
It's been lovely,
our little holiday romance.

57:12.040 --> 57:13.600
To chance encounters.

57:13.680 --> 57:14.760
To chance encounters.

57:14.840 --> 57:15.920
(WOMAN SCREAMS)

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
We should call the police.

57:17.080 --> 57:18.120
Actually, I am the police.

57:18.200 --> 57:20.800
(LOUD THUD)

57:20.880 --> 57:23.080
We know that the hotel
is in financial trouble.

57:23.160 --> 57:25.440
We have five
possible suspects.

57:25.520 --> 57:27.480
You want to know
why he kept it secret?

57:27.560 --> 57:28.720
Who's the key witness?

57:28.800 --> 57:30.760
It's me.
What are the chances, eh?

57:31.720 --> 57:33.720
