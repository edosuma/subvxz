24:58.364 --> 25:00.631
She says she saw you arguing
with the deceased

25:00.733 --> 25:02.132
the day she disappeared.

25:02.235 --> 25:03.467
What?

25:03.569 --> 25:04.768
You should know

25:04.871 --> 25:06.036
this isn't the first time
she's acted like this.

25:06.138 --> 25:07.705
Otto...

25:07.807 --> 25:09.940
Years ago, my wife...

25:10.042 --> 25:11.976
Accused me of being unfaithful.

25:12.078 --> 25:14.879
That was a long time ago,
and I was wrong.

25:14.981 --> 25:17.481
We had a fight--
a big fight.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.084
You were violent.

25:21.153 --> 25:23.153
Who knows, maybe
you killed this navarro woman

25:23.256 --> 25:24.522
out of some twisted notion
of jealousy.

25:24.624 --> 25:26.490
Are you admitting you knew her?

25:26.592 --> 25:27.625
What? No! Of course not!

25:27.727 --> 25:28.893
And I didn't know
the first one either.

25:28.995 --> 25:30.194
Damn it, karen!
Why did you do this?

25:30.296 --> 25:32.530
Why did you do this to us?

25:32.632 --> 25:33.931
Otto, it's going
to be all right.

25:34.033 --> 25:34.932
Don't do that. Don't tell me
it's gonna be all right!

25:35.034 --> 25:36.734
My wife
killed an 18-year-old girl.

25:36.836 --> 25:38.702
What were you thinking, karen?

25:38.804 --> 25:40.137
Dr. Croft,

25:40.239 --> 25:41.305

28:12.158 --> 28:13.724
Why would she kill
some random girl?

28:13.826 --> 28:15.292
I've been a psychiatrist

Well, that's too bad,

I could blame it all

32:14.233 --> 32:15.565
on one rogue employee,

32:15.668 --> 32:17.034
I could buy myself some time,

32:17.136 --> 32:21.605
maybe find some financing
to keep us afloat.

Wasn't my finest feat

32:26.245 --> 32:27.177
That's enough.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.312
Okay?

32:28.414 --> 32:30.113
I'm calling the cops,

32:30.215 --> 32:31.715
so you either kill me

32:31.817 --> 32:33.417
or you get the hell
out of here!

32:33.519 --> 32:36.286
Tell me the truth!
You owe me that much.

32:36.388 --> 32:37.554
I owe you?

32:39.024 --> 32:40.557
Ten years building this company,

This thing with your mom

you need to know.

56:15.473 --> 56:17.806
I saw my husband kill gina.

56:17.908 --> 56:19.475
He tried to erase my memories,

56:19.577 --> 56:21.910
but when
they started to come back,

56:22.012 --> 56:24.346
he planted a hypnotic suggestion

56:24.448 --> 56:26.815
for me to kill myself,

56:26.917 --> 56:28.250
and then he called the police,

56:28.352 --> 56:30.018
knowing that
they'd find the body

56:30.121 --> 56:32.621
and I would be
the prime suspect.

56:32.723 --> 56:35.491
And now you think
he's hypnotized jordan?

56:35.593 --> 56:37.059
You saw her back there.

56:37.161 --> 56:39.027
She was acting like
she was on auto-pilot.

56:39.964 --> 56:41.597
Why would he even risk that?

56:41.699 --> 56:43.599
I mean,
she's walking around in public,

56:43.701 --> 56:44.733
interacting with people.

56:44.835 --> 56:47.369
She must have found out
something about him.

56:47.471 --> 56:49.471
Well, if he went through
the trouble to hypnotize her,

56:49.573 --> 56:51.740
it must mean he's not
prepared to hurt her.

56:52.810 --> 56:54.510
Yet.

56:54.612 --> 56:56.145
Whoa.
Speaking of hurt...

it can't get infected.

want to be here,

1:01:30.020 --> 1:01:31.386
What are you doing?

1:01:31.488 --> 1:01:32.754
Well, back in high school,

1:01:32.856 --> 1:01:34.790
the shop kids used
to do this all the time,

1:01:34.892 --> 1:01:36.758
and they weren't exactly
honor-roll material.

1:01:36.860 --> 1:01:38.560
How hard can it be?

1:01:38.662 --> 1:01:39.728
-[zapping]
-ah!

1:01:39.830 --> 1:01:41.863
Harder than it looks?

1:01:47.638 --> 1:01:49.004
Nothing yet.

1:01:49.106 --> 1:01:50.138
Keep looking.

1:01:50.240 --> 1:01:52.641
They couldn't have gone far.

1:01:56.480 --> 1:01:59.614
I've got
a visual on the suspect.

1:02:00.684 --> 1:02:01.550
Police!

1:02:01.652 --> 1:02:03.118
Get out of the car.

1:02:04.922 --> 1:02:06.288
Karen, this is crazy.

1:02:06.390 --> 1:02:07.622
We've got nowhere to go.

1:02:08.492 --> 1:02:09.591
Damn it!

1:02:09.693 --> 1:02:11.893
It's push start.

1:02:14.064 --> 1:02:15.597
karen!

1:02:15.699 --> 1:02:17.566
That's not the way
to get your daughter back.

1:02:17.668 --> 1:02:21.036
If I give up now,
it's over, otto wins.

1:02:21.138 --> 1:02:22.504
What are you talking about?

1:02:22.606 --> 1:02:24.039
There's no time.

1:02:24.141 --> 1:02:26.675
My daughter is in danger.

1:02:26.777 --> 1:02:27.843
Karen!

1:02:27.945 --> 1:02:29.044
[tires squealing]

1:02:29.913 --> 1:02:31.780

1:02:49.133 --> 1:02:50.332
[otto]
do you trust me, jordan?

1:02:52.770 --> 1:02:54.269
Yes.

1:02:54.371 --> 1:02:56.104
Good.

1:02:56.206 --> 1:02:57.506
I'm glad,

1:02:57.608 --> 1:03:00.609
because you're my daughter
and I would never hurt you.

1:03:03.147 --> 1:03:05.547
[jordan, faintly] I know.

1:03:06.750 --> 1:03:09.084
When we're done here,

1:03:09.186 --> 1:03:11.419
everything that's troubled you
these last few days

1:03:11.522 --> 1:03:13.021
will be gone.

1:03:13.123 --> 1:03:15.524
We can start again
with a clean slate.

1:03:19.129 --> 1:03:20.862
[otto] hold that thought
in your mind.

1:03:24.368 --> 1:03:26.401
Cherish it.

1:03:30.741 --> 1:03:33.475
Honey, I...

1:03:36.180 --> 1:03:37.846
I never want you to doubt
that I love you...

1:03:40.851 --> 1:03:44.619
And that I'll always have
your best interests at heart.

1:03:47.057 --> 1:03:48.356
[jordan, distantly]
I know.

1:03:50.627 --> 1:03:52.828
Ruth, what the hell
are you doing?

1:03:52.930 --> 1:03:54.296
What am I doing?
What are you doing?

1:03:54.398 --> 1:03:55.797
My job!
I'm a psychiatrist.

1:03:55.899 --> 1:03:57.065
My daughter needs treatment.

1:03:57.167 --> 1:03:58.066
With a gun?

1:03:58.168 --> 1:03:59.801
I knew something
was up with her.

1:03:59.903 --> 1:04:01.803
Something is up with her.

1:04:01.905 --> 1:04:03.605
She's suffered a severe trauma.

1:04:03.707 --> 1:04:05.040
And hypnotizing her
is gonna help?

1:04:05.142 --> 1:04:06.041
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't realize

1:04:06.143 --> 1:04:07.742
that there were
two doctors in the room.

1:04:08.912 --> 1:04:10.612
Turn it off.
She's coming with me.

1:04:10.714 --> 1:04:12.080
Ruth, let's just down the--

1:04:12.182 --> 1:04:13.481
turn it off!

1:04:14.785 --> 1:04:17.185
Fine. Take it easy.

1:04:24.361 --> 1:04:25.260
[ruth] jordan...

1:04:25.362 --> 1:04:27.028
Come on.
Get up, jordan.

1:04:28.632 --> 1:04:30.031
Are you okay?

1:04:30.133 --> 1:04:31.299
Yes.

1:04:31.401 --> 1:04:32.367
See? I told you.

1:04:32.469 --> 1:04:35.437
She is here
of her own free will.

1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:38.607
Isn't that right, jordan?

1:04:43.480 --> 1:04:46.514
You haven't really thought
this through, have you, ruth?

1:04:46.617 --> 1:04:48.950
Tell me, what do you think
is gonna happen next?

1:04:49.052 --> 1:04:50.085
Stay back.

1:04:50.187 --> 1:04:52.187
We're getting a second opinion.

1:04:52.289 --> 1:04:54.189
Good one.

1:04:54.291 --> 1:04:55.624
Jordan, honey?

1:04:55.726 --> 1:04:57.559
Get me the gun.

1:04:57.661 --> 1:04:58.760
Jordan...

1:04:58.862 --> 1:05:00.095
Jordan!

1:05:02.633 --> 1:05:04.266
You know,
they might not admit it...

1:05:05.235 --> 1:05:07.569
But most people want
to be told what to do.

1:05:07.671 --> 1:05:09.504
I simply implanted
the suggestion

1:05:09.606 --> 1:05:11.606
that my voice and god's
were one and the same.

1:05:11.708 --> 1:05:14.109
Is that what you did
to your wife?

1:05:14.211 --> 1:05:15.076
Is is what
you're gonna make me do?

1:05:15.178 --> 1:05:16.211
Jump off a bridge?

1:05:16.313 --> 1:05:17.812
I don't think so.

1:05:17.915 --> 1:05:20.782
Coincidences like that
tend to make the police nervous.

1:05:20.884 --> 1:05:23.518
But then again, I can't just
let you go, can I?

1:05:23.620 --> 1:05:24.953
Jordan, please, come on.

1:05:25.055 --> 1:05:26.087
You don't want to do this.

1:05:27.090 --> 1:05:29.691
You know, I never meant
to hurt anyone.

1:05:29.793 --> 1:05:31.026
I really didn't.

1:05:31.128 --> 1:05:33.929
But, first,
karen forced me into it,

1:05:34.031 --> 1:05:35.931
and now you.

1:05:36.033 --> 1:05:38.433
I guess I'm just attracted
to the wrong women.

1:05:38.535 --> 1:05:40.869
You can go to hell,
you creep!

1:05:40.971 --> 1:05:42.604
Jordan, grab her.

1:05:42.706 --> 1:05:44.673
No, jordan, don't--

1:05:45.976 --> 1:05:47.742
[thud]

1:05:49.713 --> 1:05:51.212
all right...

1:05:51.281 --> 1:05:52.647
Let's move her.

1:06:06.163 --> 1:06:07.996
[phone ringing]

1:06:10.901 --> 1:06:11.900
hello?

1:06:12.002 --> 1:06:13.101
Dr. Bridges?

1:06:13.203 --> 1:06:15.770
This is detective chandra,
metro pd.

1:06:15.872 --> 1:06:18.273
I'm calling about
a dr. Otto croft.

1:06:18.375 --> 1:06:19.708
Now, I understand

1:06:19.810 --> 1:06:20.909
that you were the head
of the psychiatric department

1:06:21.011 --> 1:06:21.876
at county general

1:06:21.979 --> 1:06:23.011
<i> during his residency there.</i>

1:06:23.113 --> 1:06:23.945
That's correct.

1:06:24.047 --> 1:06:25.113
Is this about what happened

1:06:25.215 --> 1:06:26.748
<i> with his wife?</i>

1:06:26.850 --> 1:06:29.017
<i> Because I saw that on the news</i>
<i> and that's terrible business.</i>

1:06:29.119 --> 1:06:30.518
It is.

1:06:30.620 --> 1:06:32.120
Do you have time
to answer some questions?

1:06:32.222 --> 1:06:33.455
<i> Of course.</i>

1:06:33.557 --> 1:06:35.724
But I should tell you,
I've never met mrs. Croft.

1:06:35.826 --> 1:06:37.692
<i> It's not her</i>
<i> that I'm interested in.</i>

1:06:37.794 --> 1:06:39.327
Oh?

1:06:39.429 --> 1:06:40.929
<i> I see.</i>

1:06:41.031 --> 1:06:44.032
Can you tell me what you know
about dr. Croft's practice?

1:06:44.134 --> 1:06:45.166
<i> I know</i>

1:06:45.268 --> 1:06:47.602
that he is a very successful
psychotherapist.

1:06:47.704 --> 1:06:49.104
That's right,

1:06:49.206 --> 1:06:51.039
and did you know
that he uses hypnosis

1:06:51.141 --> 1:06:53.475
as a major component
of his treatment?

1:06:53.577 --> 1:06:54.976
No, I didn't,

1:06:55.078 --> 1:06:59.214
but that is a very accepted part
of cognitive behavioral therapy.

1:06:59.316 --> 1:07:01.149
Do you have any expertise
in that area?

1:07:01.251 --> 1:07:02.517
<i> Expertise? No.</i>

1:07:02.619 --> 1:07:05.053
<i> I've always felt</i>
<i> hypnosis to be</i>

1:07:05.155 --> 1:07:06.721
more of an art
than a science.

1:07:06.823 --> 1:07:08.790
Hmm. So you think it's bunk?

1:07:08.892 --> 1:07:10.125
<i> Not at all.</i>

1:07:10.227 --> 1:07:12.427
It can be a very powerful tool,

1:07:12.529 --> 1:07:15.830
but the effects sometimes
are... Unpredictable.

1:07:16.767 --> 1:07:18.800
<i> Detective, what is this about?</i>

1:07:18.902 --> 1:07:21.736
I'm just chasing down a hunch.

1:07:21.838 --> 1:07:23.204
Well, reading between the lines,

1:07:23.306 --> 1:07:24.539
it sounds like you believe

1:07:24.641 --> 1:07:26.608
that someone involved
in this case was hypnotized.

1:07:26.710 --> 1:07:29.010
Hmm. You see right through me.

1:07:29.112 --> 1:07:31.012
Now, tell me,
is it possible for a person

1:07:31.114 --> 1:07:33.014
to be hypnotized
against their will?

1:07:33.116 --> 1:07:34.416
<i> No.</i>

1:07:34.518 --> 1:07:36.718
But a skilled hypnotist
could make someone do things

1:07:36.820 --> 1:07:39.354
that would otherwise be
outside of their nature?

1:07:39.456 --> 1:07:42.123
<i> Well, that is the goal</i>
<i> of guided hypnotherapy.</i>

1:07:42.225 --> 1:07:45.226
Freeing a patient
from bad habits,

1:07:45.328 --> 1:07:47.062
addictions, and so on.

1:07:47.164 --> 1:07:48.797
<i> And what about self-harm?</i>

1:07:48.899 --> 1:07:52.133
Could someone be hypnotized
to commit suicide?

1:07:53.637 --> 1:07:55.503
As I said,
I am no expert...

1:07:55.605 --> 1:07:58.239
But there have been cases

1:07:58.341 --> 1:07:59.541
<i> where deaths</i>
<i> have been attributed</i>

1:07:59.643 --> 1:08:00.875
<i> to bungled hypnosis,</i>

1:08:00.977 --> 1:08:02.610
<i> if not outright malfeasance.</i>

1:08:03.580 --> 1:08:04.946
So the answer is "yes."

1:08:05.048 --> 1:08:08.216
<i> a qualified one, sure.</i>

1:08:08.318 --> 1:08:09.851
What about murder?

1:08:09.953 --> 1:08:11.486
Detective,
are you suggesting

1:08:11.588 --> 1:08:13.221
that dr. Croft
might be involved

1:08:13.323 --> 1:08:14.722
in the death
of that poor woman?

1:08:14.825 --> 1:08:16.024
Well, like I said,

1:08:16.126 --> 1:08:18.960
I'm just pursuing a hunch
to see where it leads.

1:08:19.062 --> 1:08:22.097
<i> It sounds like you have</i>
<i> all your answers.</i>

1:08:22.199 --> 1:08:24.833
You know what?
I think I do, too.

1:08:24.935 --> 1:08:27.969
Thank you for your time, doctor.
I appreciate it.

[hugh] who's ruth?

1:08:50.894 --> 1:08:52.727
My daughter's best friend.

1:08:52.829 --> 1:08:54.696
I think she's having
an affair with otto.

1:08:54.798 --> 1:08:56.865
Isn't that a bit of a leap?

1:08:56.967 --> 1:08:58.566
She's the same age
as gina navarro.

1:08:58.668 --> 1:08:59.901
Ah.

1:09:00.003 --> 1:09:01.402
She was flirting with him
right in front of me.

1:09:01.505 --> 1:09:03.805
Okay.

1:09:03.907 --> 1:09:06.441
So how do you want to do this?

1:09:06.543 --> 1:09:07.575
You distract him,

1:09:07.677 --> 1:09:09.043
I'll go get the girls
out of there.

1:09:09.146 --> 1:09:10.678
How do you want me
to distract him?

1:09:11.882 --> 1:09:13.481
I have an idea,

1:09:13.583 --> 1:09:15.116
but I'm not sure
it will work.

1:09:15.218 --> 1:09:16.417
Why not?

1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:18.086
Because he has to believe
that you'd sell me out.

1:09:19.923 --> 1:09:22.323
In senior year,

I was hoping for.

1:09:30.367 --> 1:09:32.734
Um... I don't know,
I've never used it before.

1:09:32.836 --> 1:09:33.835
Why?

1:09:33.937 --> 1:09:35.637
Because you have
to get him talking.

1:09:35.739 --> 1:09:37.605
We need him
to incriminate himself.

1:09:37.707 --> 1:09:38.840
Right.

1:09:41.778 --> 1:09:42.977
Can you do this, hugh?

1:09:43.079 --> 1:09:44.279
Yeah.

1:09:44.381 --> 1:09:46.080

I didn't really get a chance
to look around

1:12:04.020 --> 1:12:04.952
last time I was here.

1:12:05.055 --> 1:12:06.020
Yeah, listen,

1:12:06.122 --> 1:12:08.489
I'm a pretty busy man,
mr. Gossett.

1:12:08.591 --> 1:12:09.991
I'd appreciate it
if you just got to the point.

1:12:10.093 --> 1:12:13.027
I'm sure the cops told you
your wife flew the coop.

1:12:13.129 --> 1:12:14.662
I'm aware, yeah.

1:12:14.764 --> 1:12:16.297
What do you know about it?

1:12:16.399 --> 1:12:18.399
Well, for a while there,
I was her hostage.

1:12:18.501 --> 1:12:20.001
That was fun.

1:12:21.171 --> 1:12:22.337
Wow!

1:12:22.439 --> 1:12:23.805
Nice pool.

I'll bet they charged an arm
and a leg for all this, huh?

1:12:26.509 --> 1:12:28.576
Listen, if you know
where my wife is,

1:12:28.678 --> 1:12:30.945
you should really
tell the police.

1:12:33.683 --> 1:12:34.782
I could.

1:12:34.884 --> 1:12:37.719
Do the right thing,
be a hero, all that stuff.

1:12:37.821 --> 1:12:40.822
But I don't think
it'd be very good for you.

1:12:40.924 --> 1:12:42.090
For me?

1:12:42.192 --> 1:12:44.092
Oh, well, all I want

1:12:44.194 --> 1:12:46.160
is for karen to get
the help that she needs.

The "upstanding citizen" act.

I'm have no idea
what you mean.

1:12:56.106 --> 1:12:59.073
Your wife's had
total recall, doc.

1:13:12.055 --> 1:13:14.055

Oh, you know...

1:13:15.625 --> 1:13:17.658
About discovering the affair.

1:13:17.761 --> 1:13:19.594
About you killing gina
to cover it up,

1:13:19.696 --> 1:13:22.029
and then juicing her
to erase her memory.

1:13:22.132 --> 1:13:24.632
It's quite a story.

1:13:24.734 --> 1:13:26.134
If I were you,

1:13:26.236 --> 1:13:28.503
I wouldn't want her blabbing it
to the cops.

1:13:29.472 --> 1:13:32.073
That is quite the story.

1:13:32.175 --> 1:13:34.809
But the police didn't
believe her the first time,

1:13:34.911 --> 1:13:36.778
why would they believe her now?

1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:38.880
Yeah, maybe they'd believe her,
maybe they wouldn't.

1:13:38.982 --> 1:13:41.616
Either way, I'd bet
you'd sleep better at night

1:13:41.718 --> 1:13:42.750
if you could
just get rid of her

1:13:42.852 --> 1:13:44.085
and blame it on someone else.

1:13:44.187 --> 1:13:46.387
Just like you did with gina.

1:13:47.757 --> 1:13:48.656
And it seems to me

1:13:48.758 --> 1:13:50.124
that being able
to make that happen

1:13:50.226 --> 1:13:51.592
should be worth something.

You think
that I killed gina navarro,

1:14:00.336 --> 1:14:01.502
and now you're here to, what?

1:21:27.283 --> 1:21:29.483
Did it happen
like your husband said?

1:21:29.585 --> 1:21:31.318
No.

1:21:31.420 --> 1:21:33.821
Then who pulled the trigger?

1:21:37.927 --> 1:21:39.059
I did.

1:21:39.161 --> 1:21:40.094
No, no, no, no, no.

1:21:40.196 --> 1:21:41.729
She's lying.
It was me. I-I--

1:21:41.831 --> 1:21:43.697
I was--
I was hypnotized. I didn't...

1:21:43.799 --> 1:21:45.799
[tearfully]
I didn't mean to. I swear.

1:21:45.902 --> 1:21:47.201
I didn't mean to kill him.

1:21:51.540 --> 1:21:54.875
We're all gonna
head down to the station.

1:22:02.385 --> 1:22:04.084
[officer]
we have an injured man here.

1:22:04.186 --> 1:22:06.020
We need an ambulance, stat.

1:22:06.122 --> 1:22:07.488
Did he just say injured?

1:22:07.590 --> 1:22:08.589
He's alive.

1:22:12.995 --> 1:22:15.629
[♪♪♪]

1:22:31.547 --> 1:22:32.780
hey.

1:22:36.085 --> 1:22:37.051
How are you?

1:22:37.153 --> 1:22:38.218
Healing.

1:22:39.221 --> 1:22:40.955
Still sore?

1:22:41.057 --> 1:22:43.023
Oh... No complaints.

1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:45.693
So how's my best buddy, otto?

1:22:45.795 --> 1:22:47.294
[chuckles]

1:22:47.396 --> 1:22:49.763
cooling his heels in jail.

1:22:52.468 --> 1:22:54.001
Nice view.

1:22:54.103 --> 1:22:55.135
Yeah.

1:22:55.237 --> 1:22:57.671
From this side.

1:22:59.909 --> 1:23:03.410
And to think
this is where we first met.

1:23:03.512 --> 1:23:04.912
Crazy, huh?

1:23:06.649 --> 1:23:09.149
You took a bullet
for jordan and I.

1:23:10.252 --> 1:23:11.418
Yeah...

1:23:11.520 --> 1:23:13.053
Guess I did, didn't I?

1:23:16.392 --> 1:23:18.292
So... Does that get me a date?

1:23:18.394 --> 1:23:19.860
Or a dinner, maybe?

1:23:22.898 --> 1:23:25.299
[♪♪♪]

1:23:36.645 --> 1:23:37.811
[hugh] I'll take that a yes.

1:23:37.913 --> 1:23:38.979
[karen] I'm buying.

1:23:39.081 --> 1:23:40.981
[hugh] oh! Okay.

1:23:43.686 --> 1:23:48.355
